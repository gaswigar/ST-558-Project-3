note
i
wish
to
express
my
gratitude
for
great
help
received
in
the
writing
of
this
book
to
miss
macdermot
miss
stearne
and
others
as
well
as
to
three
friends
who
submitted
to
hearing
it
read
aloud
in
manuscript
and
who
assisted
me
by
their
criticisms
and
suggestions
further
i
think
it
worth
saying
that
in
all
historical
episodes
in
this
book
i
have
taken
pains
to
be
as
accurate
as
possible
the
various
plots
the
political
movements
and
the
closing
scenes
of
charles
life
are
here
described
with
as
much
fidelity
to
truth
as
is
compatible
with
historical
romance
in
particular
i
do
not
think
that
the
king
himself
is
represented
as
doing
or
saying
anything
except
of
course
to
my
fictitious
personages
to
which
sound
history
does
not
testify
i
have
also
taken
considerable
pains
in
the
topographical
descriptions
of
whitehall
prologue
the
day
from
which
i
reckon
the
beginning
of
all
those
adventures
which
occupied
me
in
the
courts
of
england
and
france
and
elsewhere
was
the
first
day
of
may
in
the
year
sixteen
hundred
and
the
day
that
is
on
which
my
lord
abbot
carried
me
from
walls
to
the
vatican
palace
to
see
our
most
holy
lord
innocent
the
eleventh
it
had
been
a
very
hot
day
in
rome
as
was
to
be
expected
at
that
season
and
i
had
stayed
in
the
cloister
in
the
cool
as
my
lord
abbot
had
bidden
me
not
knowing
whether
it
would
be
on
that
day
or
another
or
indeed
on
any
at
all
that
his
holiness
would
send
for
me
i
knew
that
my
lord
abbot
had
been
to
the
vatican
again
and
again
on
the
business
and
had
spoken
of
me
as
he
said
he
would
not
to
the
holy
father
only
but
to
the
cardinal
secretary
of
state
and
to
others
but
i
did
not
know
and
he
did
not
tell
me
as
to
whether
that
business
had
been
prosperous
though
i
think
he
must
have
known
long
before
how
it
would
end
an
hour
before
then
he
sent
to
me
as
i
walked
in
the
cloisters
and
when
i
came
to
him
told
me
all
short
to
dress
myself
in
my
old
secular
clothes
as
fine
as
i
could
and
to
be
ready
to
ride
with
him
in
half
an
hour
because
our
most
holy
lord
had
consented
to
receive
me
one
hour
after
he
said
nothing
more
to
me
than
that
he
did
not
tell
me
how
i
was
to
bear
myself
nor
what
i
was
to
say
neither
as
i
stood
in
his
cell
nor
as
we
rode
as
fast
as
we
could
with
the
servants
before
and
behind
into
rome
and
through
the
streets
of
it
i
knew
nothing
more
than
this
that
since
neither
i
nor
my
were
in
the
least
satisfied
as
to
my
vocation
and
since
i
had
considerable
estates
of
my
own
in
france
though
i
was
an
englishman
altogether
on
my
father
side
and
could
speak
both
french
and
english
with
equal
ease
and
italian
and
spanish
tolerably
that
since
in
short
i
was
a
very
young
gentleman
and
looked
more
than
my
years
and
bore
myself
so
i
was
told
with
ease
and
discretion
in
any
company
and
could
act
a
part
if
it
were
required
of
me
i
might
perhaps
be
of
better
service
to
the
church
in
some
secular
employment
than
in
sacred
this
was
all
that
i
knew
the
rest
my
lord
abbot
left
to
my
own
wits
to
understand
and
to
our
holy
father
if
he
would
to
discover
to
me
and
that
indeed
was
presently
what
he
did
i
had
been
within
the
vatican
before
three
or
four
times
both
when
i
had
first
come
to
rome
four
years
ago
and
once
as
attendant
upon
my
lord
abbot
but
never
before
had
i
felt
of
such
importance
within
those
walls
for
this
time
it
was
myself
to
whom
the
holy
father
was
to
give
audience
and
not
merely
to
one
in
whose
company
i
was
i
was
in
secular
clothes
too
the
peruke
buckles
sword
and
all
the
rest
which
i
had
laid
aside
two
years
ago
though
these
were
a
little
old
and
tarnished
and
i
bore
myself
as
young
men
will
for
i
was
only
years
old
at
that
time
with
an
air
and
a
swing
though
my
heart
beat
a
little
faster
as
we
passed
through
the
great
rooms
after
leaving
our
cloaks
in
an
antechamber
and
arranging
our
dress
after
the
ride
and
at
last
were
bidden
to
sit
down
while
the
young
monsignore
who
had
received
us
in
the
last
saloon
went
in
to
know
if
the
holy
father
were
ready
to
see
us
it
was
a
smaller
room
this
in
which
we
sat
than
the
others
through
which
we
had
passed
and
in
which
the
crimson
liveried
servants
were
and
its
walls
were
all
covered
with
hangings
from
cornice
to
floor
that
which
was
opposite
to
me
presented
i
remember
jacob
receiving
the
blessing
which
his
brother
esau
should
have
had
and
i
wondered
as
i
sat
there
whether
i
myself
were
come
as
jacob
to
get
a
blessing
to
which
i
had
no
right
idly
lord
abbot
said
nothing
at
all
for
he
was
a
stout
man
and
a
little
out
of
breath
and
almost
before
he
had
got
it
again
and
before
i
was
sure
as
to
whether
i
were
more
like
to
the
liar
jacob
who
won
a
blessing
when
he
should
not
or
to
unspiritual
esau
who
lost
a
blessing
which
he
should
have
had
the
young
monsignore
in
his
purple
came
back
again
and
bowing
so
low
that
we
saw
the
little
tonsure
on
the
top
of
his
head
beckoned
to
us
to
enter
by
the
time
that
behind
my
lord
abbot
i
had
performed
the
three
genuflections
and
at
the
third
was
kissing
the
ring
of
our
most
holy
lord
i
had
already
taken
into
my
mind
something
of
the
room
i
was
in
and
of
him
who
sat
there
wheeled
round
in
his
chair
to
greet
us
the
room
was
far
more
plain
than
i
had
thought
to
find
it
though
pretty
rich
too
the
walls
had
sacred
hangings
upon
them
but
it
was
so
dark
with
the
shuttered
windows
that
i
could
not
make
out
very
well
what
their
subjects
were
a
dozen
damask
and
gilt
chairs
stood
round
the
walls
and
three
or
four
tables
and
in
the
centre
of
all
where
i
was
now
arrived
stood
the
greatest
table
of
all
carved
of
some
black
wood
and
at
the
middle
of
one
side
the
chair
in
which
sat
the
holy
father
himself
he
had
very
kind
but
very
piercing
eyes
this
was
the
first
thing
that
i
thought
his
hair
beneath
his
cap
as
well
as
his
beard
was
all
his
complexion
was
a
little
sallow
and
seemed
all
the
more
sallow
because
of
his
red
velvet
cap
and
white
soutane
for
he
wore
no
cloak
because
of
the
heat
as
soon
as
i
had
kissed
his
ring
he
bade
me
stand
up
speaking
in
italian
as
he
did
all
through
the
audience
and
then
beckoned
me
to
a
chair
opposite
to
his
and
my
lord
abbot
to
another
on
one
side
and
then
at
once
he
went
on
to
speak
of
the
business
on
which
we
were
come
as
if
he
knew
all
about
it
and
had
no
time
to
spend
on
compliments
now
our
holy
father
innocent
the
eleventh
was
i
suppose
one
of
the
greatest
men
that
ever
sat
in
peter
seat
i
would
not
speak
evil
if
i
could
help
it
of
any
of
christ
vicars
but
this
at
least
i
may
say
that
pope
innocent
reformed
a
number
of
things
that
sorely
needed
it
he
would
have
no
nepotism
at
the
papal
court
men
stood
or
fell
by
their
own
merits
so
i
knew
very
well
that
my
estates
in
france
even
if
they
had
been
ten
times
as
great
would
serve
me
nothing
at
all
he
was
very
humble
too
he
asked
pardon
it
was
said
even
of
his
own
servants
if
he
troubled
them
so
i
knew
that
no
swashbuckling
air
on
my
part
would
do
me
anything
but
harm
and
indeed
that
was
all
laid
aside
willy
nilly
so
soon
as
i
came
in
since
like
all
humble
men
he
esteemed
the
pride
even
of
kings
at
exactly
its
proper
worth
which
is
nothing
at
all
he
was
too
a
man
of
great
spirituality
so
i
knew
that
my
having
come
to
paul
as
a
novice
and
now
wishing
to
leave
it
again
would
scarcely
exalt
me
in
his
eyes
i
felt
then
a
very
poor
creature
indeed
as
i
sat
there
and
listened
to
him
this
then
is
master
roger
mallock
he
said
to
my
lord
abbot
of
whom
your
lordship
spoke
to
me
this
is
he
holy
father
said
my
lord
he
has
been
a
novice
for
two
years
then
and
his
superiors
are
not
sure
of
his
vocation
yes
holy
father
the
pope
looked
again
at
me
then
and
i
dropped
my
eyes
and
you
yourself
my
son
he
asked
holy
father
i
said
i
am
sure
that
at
present
i
have
no
vocation
what
god
may
give
me
in
the
future
i
do
not
know
i
only
know
what
he
has
not
given
me
in
the
present
innocent
tightened
his
lips
at
that
but
i
think
it
was
to
prevent
himself
smiling
and
he
is
an
english
gentleman
he
went
on
presently
and
he
has
estates
in
france
that
bring
him
in
above
twenty
thousand
francs
yearly
and
he
is
years
of
age
and
he
is
accustomed
to
all
kinds
of
society
and
he
is
a
devoted
son
of
holy
church
and
he
speaks
french
and
english
and
italian
and
spanish
and
german
no
holy
father
not
german
except
a
few
words
i
said
and
he
is
discreet
and
courageous
and
virtuous
holy
father
i
began
in
distress
for
i
thought
he
was
mocking
me
and
he
desires
nothing
better
than
to
serve
his
spiritual
superiors
in
any
employment
to
which
they
may
put
him
eh
my
son
i
looked
into
the
pope
face
and
down
again
but
i
said
nothing
eh
my
son
he
said
again
with
a
certain
sharpness
holy
father
i
have
been
taught
never
to
contradict
my
superiors
but
indeed
in
this
bravo
said
innocent
then
he
turned
to
my
lord
abbot
as
if
i
were
no
longer
in
the
room
the
question
he
said
is
not
only
whether
this
young
gentleman
is
capable
of
hearing
everything
and
saying
nothing
of
preserving
his
virtue
of
handling
locked
caskets
without
even
desiring
to
look
inside
unless
it
is
his
business
of
living
in
the
world
yet
not
being
of
it
but
whether
he
is
willing
to
do
all
this
without
being
paid
for
it
except
perhaps
his
bare
expenses
my
lord
abbot
said
nothing
i
can
have
a
thousand
paid
servants
said
innocent
who
are
worth
exactly
their
wages
but
since
money
can
not
buy
virtue
or
discretion
or
courage
in
such
servants
i
can
not
demand
those
things
and
i
can
have
a
thousand
foolish
servants
who
could
earn
no
wages
anywhere
because
of
their
foolishness
and
these
never
have
discretion
and
not
often
either
virtue
or
courage
but
what
i
wish
is
to
have
servants
who
are
as
wise
sons
to
me
who
have
all
these
things
and
will
use
them
for
sake
for
the
love
of
holy
church
and
of
christ
and
his
mother
and
who
will
be
content
with
the
wages
that
these
give
he
stopped
suddenly
and
looked
at
me
quickly
again
and
my
heart
burned
in
my
breast
for
this
that
he
was
saying
was
all
that
i
most
desired
and
i
saw
by
that
that
my
talk
must
have
been
reported
to
him
i
loved
holy
church
then
and
the
cause
of
jesus
and
mary
as
young
men
do
love
and
as
i
hope
to
love
till
i
die
i
asked
nothing
better
than
to
serve
such
causes
as
these
even
to
death
it
was
not
for
lack
of
ardour
that
i
wished
to
leave
the
monastery
it
was
because
truthfully
i
had
a
fever
on
me
of
greater
activity
because
truthfully
i
was
not
sure
of
my
vocation
because
truthfully
i
doubted
whether
such
gifts
and
such
wealth
and
such
education
as
were
mine
could
not
be
used
better
in
the
world
than
in
the
cloister
i
knew
that
i
could
take
a
place
in
either
the
french
or
the
english
court
without
disgracing
myself
or
others
and
it
was
precisely
of
this
that
i
had
spoken
to
my
lord
abbot
and
here
was
our
holy
father
himself
putting
into
words
those
very
ambitions
that
i
had
i
met
his
eyes
and
knew
that
i
was
beginning
to
flush
well
my
son
he
said
holy
father
i
said
my
virtues
and
capacities
such
as
they
are
i
must
leave
to
my
superiors
but
my
desires
are
those
of
which
your
holiness
has
spoken
i
ask
no
wages
i
ask
only
to
be
allowed
to
serve
whatever
cause
my
superiors
may
assign
to
me
he
continued
to
look
at
me
and
for
very
shame
i
presently
dropped
my
eyes
again
well
my
lord
abbot
he
said
again
let
us
hear
what
you
have
to
say
then
my
lord
began
to
speak
and
before
he
was
i
wished
myself
anywhere
else
in
the
world
for
as
great
men
alone
are
capable
he
could
be
as
lavish
of
praise
as
of
blame
he
said
that
i
was
all
that
of
which
his
holiness
had
spoken
that
i
had
been
obedient
and
exact
as
a
novice
and
he
said
other
things
too
of
which
even
under
obedience
i
could
not
speak
then
too
he
added
what
he
had
never
said
to
me
before
that
he
was
not
sure
that
i
had
no
vocation
but
that
since
god
spoke
through
exterior
circumstances
as
well
as
through
interior
drawings
his
holy
will
seemed
to
point
at
least
at
present
to
a
life
in
the
world
for
me
that
he
was
sure
i
would
be
as
obedient
there
as
here
that
i
had
learned
not
only
to
use
my
tongue
but
what
is
much
harder
to
hold
it
and
he
ended
by
begging
the
holy
father
to
take
me
into
his
service
and
to
use
me
in
the
ways
in
which
perhaps
i
might
be
useful
all
this
of
course
i
now
understand
to
have
been
rehearsed
before
but
just
at
that
time
i
had
no
more
than
a
suspicion
that
this
was
so
when
he
had
finished
his
holiness
once
more
turned
and
looked
at
me
and
i
upon
the
ground
and
then
at
last
he
spoke
my
son
he
said
you
have
heard
what
his
reverence
has
said
of
you
and
i
too
have
heard
it
and
not
for
the
first
time
it
seems
that
you
are
right
in
thinking
that
for
the
present
at
any
rate
you
have
no
vocation
to
holy
religion
well
then
the
question
is
as
to
what
is
your
vocation
for
our
lord
never
leaves
any
man
without
a
vocation
of
some
kind
you
are
very
young
for
such
service
as
that
on
which
we
think
to
send
you
for
we
shall
send
you
to
the
court
of
england
first
and
then
perhaps
now
and
again
to
france
but
you
look
five
years
at
least
older
than
your
age
and
i
am
told
have
ten
times
its
discretion
i
need
not
tell
you
that
you
will
have
no
very
heavy
mission
given
to
you
at
first
you
must
mix
freely
with
the
world
and
use
your
wits
and
see
what
is
best
to
be
done
sending
back
reports
to
the
cardinal
secretary
you
will
live
at
your
own
charges
as
you
yourself
have
said
that
you
wished
to
do
but
you
may
draw
upon
us
here
for
any
journeys
that
you
may
undertake
upon
our
business
up
to
a
certain
amount
in
a
word
you
will
be
in
the
diplomatic
service
of
the
holy
see
though
without
direct
office
or
commission
beyond
that
which
i
now
give
you
myself
you
will
have
full
liberty
to
make
a
career
for
yourself
in
the
english
or
french
courts
so
long
as
this
comes
always
second
to
your
service
to
ourselves
if
you
acquit
yourself
well
in
the
way
which
will
be
explained
to
you
later
you
may
make
a
career
with
us
too
and
will
have
rewards
if
you
want
them
but
for
the
present
there
must
be
no
talk
of
that
as
you
must
be
in
the
world
yet
not
of
it
so
you
must
be
of
the
court
of
rome
yet
not
in
it
it
is
a
delicate
position
that
you
will
hold
and
to
compensate
for
the
informality
of
it
you
will
have
the
more
liberty
on
your
side
to
make
a
career
as
i
have
said
or
to
marry
if
god
calls
you
to
that
or
in
any
other
way
does
that
content
you
my
son
i
do
not
know
what
i
said
for
all
that
the
holy
father
had
told
me
was
what
i
myself
had
said
to
my
lord
abbot
i
knew
that
affairs
in
england
were
in
a
very
strange
condition
that
the
duke
of
york
who
was
next
heir
to
the
throne
was
a
catholic
and
that
charles
himself
was
favourably
disposed
to
us
and
i
knew
a
number
of
other
things
too
which
will
appear
in
the
course
of
this
tale
and
i
had
said
to
my
lord
that
sometimes
even
a
hair
weight
will
make
a
balance
tip
and
had
asked
again
and
again
if
i
might
not
with
my
advantages
such
as
they
were
be
of
more
service
to
holy
church
in
a
more
worldly
place
than
the
cloister
and
now
here
was
our
most
holy
lord
himself
granting
and
confirming
all
that
i
had
wished
there
there
he
said
to
me
presently
when
i
had
tried
to
say
what
was
in
my
heart
go
and
serve
god
in
this
way
as
well
as
you
can
and
remember
that
you
can
be
as
well
sanctified
in
the
court
of
a
king
as
in
a
cloister
and
better
if
it
is
the
court
that
is
your
vocation
go
and
do
your
best
my
son
and
we
shall
see
what
you
can
make
of
it
when
we
were
outside
again
i
saw
that
my
lord
abbot
face
was
all
suffused
as
was
my
own
for
there
was
something
strangely
fiery
and
keen
and
holy
about
innocent
but
he
said
nothing
except
that
we
must
now
go
and
see
his
eminence
the
cardinal
secretary
of
state
for
i
was
to
receive
my
more
particular
instructions
from
him
part
one
chapter
i
i
came
to
london
on
the
fifteenth
of
june
having
left
it
seven
years
before
in
company
with
my
father
to
go
to
paris
two
years
before
he
died
it
was
drawing
on
to
sunset
as
we
rode
up
through
the
southwark
fields
and
at
the
top
of
a
little
eminence
in
the
ground
saw
for
the
first
time
plainly
all
the
city
displayed
before
us
we
came
along
the
kent
road
having
caught
sight
again
and
again
of
such
spires
as
had
risen
after
the
great
fire
and
of
the
smoke
that
rose
from
the
chimneys
but
i
may
say
that
i
was
astonished
at
the
progress
the
builders
had
made
from
what
i
could
remember
of
seven
years
before
then
there
had
still
been
left
great
open
spaces
where
there
should
have
been
none
now
it
was
a
city
once
more
and
even
the
cathedral
shewed
its
walls
and
a
few
roofs
above
the
houses
the
steeples
too
of
sir
christopher
wren
new
churches
pricked
everywhere
though
i
saw
later
that
there
was
yet
much
building
to
be
done
both
in
these
and
in
many
of
the
greater
houses
my
man
james
rode
with
me
for
i
had
been
careful
not
to
form
too
great
intimacies
with
the
party
with
whom
i
had
ridden
from
dover
and
i
remarked
to
him
upon
the
matter
and
there
sir
he
said
to
me
pointing
to
it
is
the
monument
no
doubt
that
they
have
raised
to
it
and
so
we
found
it
to
be
a
day
or
two
later
a
tall
pillar
with
an
inscription
upon
it
saying
that
the
fire
had
been
caused
by
the
papists
a
black
lie
as
every
honest
man
knows
by
the
time
that
we
came
to
london
bridge
the
sun
was
yet
lower
setting
in
a
glory
of
crimson
so
that
it
was
hard
to
see
against
it
much
of
westminster
across
the
southwark
marshes
and
the
river
but
yet
i
could
make
out
the
roofs
of
the
abbey
and
of
some
of
the
great
buildings
of
whitehall
where
my
adventures
i
thought
were
to
lie
but
between
that
and
the
other
end
of
london
bridge
just
before
we
set
foot
on
it
the
rest
of
the
city
was
plain
enough
and
indeed
it
was
a
splendid
sight
to
see
the
river
all
as
it
seemed
of
molten
gold
with
the
barges
and
the
wherries
plying
upon
it
and
the
great
houses
on
the
banks
and
their
gardens
coming
down
to
the
and
the
forest
of
chimneys
and
roofs
and
steeples
behind
and
all
of
a
translucent
blue
colour
the
sounds
of
the
city
too
came
to
us
plainly
across
the
water
the
chiming
of
bells
and
the
firing
of
some
sunset
gun
and
even
the
noise
of
wheels
and
the
barking
of
dogs
and
the
crowing
of
cocks
all
in
a
soft
medley
of
human
music
that
made
my
heart
rejoice
for
in
spite
of
my
long
exile
abroad
and
my
french
and
italianate
manners
i
counted
myself
always
an
englishman
now
the
first
design
that
i
had
in
mind
and
for
which
i
had
made
my
dispositions
was
to
go
straight
to
my
lodging
that
had
been
secured
for
me
by
my
cousin
tom
jermyn
where
he
was
to
meet
me
and
where
he
too
would
lie
that
night
it
was
with
him
that
i
was
to
present
my
letters
at
whitehall
in
a
day
or
two
after
i
had
bought
my
clothes
and
other
necessaries
in
short
he
was
to
be
my
for
a
while
for
he
was
a
catholic
too
like
myself
but
he
was
not
to
be
told
that
i
had
come
on
any
mission
at
all
until
at
anyrate
i
had
well
tested
his
discretion
now
the
mission
on
which
i
had
been
instructed
by
the
cardinal
secretary
was
in
one
sense
a
very
light
one
and
in
another
a
very
difficult
one
for
its
express
duties
were
of
the
smallest
affairs
in
england
at
this
time
were
in
a
very
strange
condition
first
the
duke
of
york
who
was
heir
to
the
throne
was
a
declared
catholic
and
then
the
king
himself
was
next
door
to
one
in
heart
at
anyrate
certainly
he
had
never
been
reconciled
to
the
church
though
the
report
among
some
was
that
he
had
been
during
his
life
in
paris
but
in
heart
as
i
have
said
he
was
one
and
waited
only
for
a
favourable
occasion
to
declare
himself
for
he
had
been
so
bold
seventeen
years
before
as
to
send
to
rome
a
scheme
by
which
the
church
of
england
was
to
be
reunited
to
rome
under
certain
conditions
as
that
the
mass
or
parts
of
it
should
be
read
in
english
that
the
protestant
clergy
who
would
submit
to
ordination
should
be
allowed
to
keep
their
wives
and
other
matters
of
that
kind
his
answer
from
rome
sent
by
word
of
mouth
only
was
that
no
scheme
could
be
nearer
to
the
heart
of
his
holiness
but
that
he
must
not
be
too
precipitate
let
him
first
show
that
his
subjects
were
with
him
in
his
laudable
desires
and
then
perhaps
the
terms
of
the
matter
might
be
spoken
of
again
for
the
king
himself
and
indeed
even
the
duke
too
at
this
time
though
later
he
amended
his
life
catholic
in
spirit
were
scarce
christian
in
life
the
ladies
of
the
court
then
must
not
be
overlooked
for
they
as
much
as
any
statesman
and
some
think
more
controlled
the
king
and
his
brother
very
greatly
at
this
time
but
this
was
not
all
next
the
king
was
embroiled
in
a
great
number
of
ways
the
more
extreme
of
his
protestant
subjects
feared
and
hated
the
catholic
church
as
much
as
good
catholics
hate
and
fear
the
devil
and
although
for
the
present
our
people
had
great
liberty
both
at
court
and
elsewhere
no
man
could
tell
when
that
liberty
might
be
curtailed
and
indeed
it
had
been
to
a
great
part
already
curtailed
five
years
before
by
the
test
act
forbidding
the
catholics
to
hold
any
high
place
at
the
court
or
elsewhere
though
this
was
largely
evaded
there
was
even
a
movement
among
some
of
them
and
among
the
most
important
of
them
too
in
the
house
of
lords
and
elsewhere
to
exclude
the
duke
of
york
from
the
succession
and
they
advanced
amongst
themselves
in
support
of
this
the
fear
that
a
french
army
might
be
brought
in
to
subdue
england
to
the
church
and
worst
of
all
as
i
had
learned
privately
in
rome
there
was
some
substance
in
their
fear
though
few
else
knew
it
since
the
king
was
in
private
treaty
with
louis
for
this
very
purpose
again
a
further
embroilment
lay
in
the
propositions
that
had
been
made
privately
to
the
king
that
he
should
rid
himself
of
his
queen
catherine
on
the
pretext
that
she
had
borne
no
child
to
him
and
could
not
and
marry
instead
some
protestant
princess
lastly
and
most
important
of
all
so
greatly
was
charles
turned
towards
the
church
that
he
had
begged
more
than
once
and
again
lately
that
a
priest
might
be
sent
to
him
to
be
always
at
hand
in
the
event
of
his
sudden
sickness
whom
none
else
knew
to
be
a
priest
and
it
was
this
last
matter
i
think
that
had
determined
the
holy
father
to
let
me
go
as
i
had
wished
though
i
was
no
priest
to
see
how
the
king
would
bear
himself
to
me
and
then
perhaps
afterwards
a
priest
might
be
sent
as
he
desired
this
then
was
the
mission
on
which
i
was
come
to
london
i
was
to
present
myself
at
court
and
place
myself
at
his
disposal
the
letters
that
i
carried
were
no
more
than
such
as
any
gentleman
might
bring
with
him
but
the
king
had
been
told
beforehand
who
i
was
and
that
i
was
come
to
be
a
messenger
or
a
if
he
so
wished
with
him
and
rome
so
much
the
king
was
told
and
the
duke
but
on
my
side
i
was
told
a
little
more
that
i
was
to
do
my
utmost
if
the
king
were
pleased
with
me
to
further
his
conversion
and
his
declaration
of
himself
as
a
catholic
that
i
was
to
mix
with
all
kinds
of
folks
and
observe
what
men
really
thought
of
all
such
matters
as
these
and
send
my
reports
regularly
to
rome
that
i
was
to
place
myself
at
the
king
service
in
any
way
that
i
could
in
short
that
i
was
to
follow
my
discretion
and
do
as
a
layman
may
sometimes
even
more
than
a
priest
all
that
was
in
my
power
for
the
furtherance
of
the
catholic
cause
now
it
may
be
wondered
perhaps
how
it
was
that
i
who
was
so
young
should
be
entrusted
with
such
matters
as
these
here
then
i
am
bound
to
say
however
immodest
it
may
appear
that
i
have
had
always
the
art
of
making
friends
easily
and
of
commending
myself
quickly
i
had
lived
too
in
the
societies
of
both
paris
and
rome
and
i
had
the
accomplishments
of
a
gentleman
as
well
as
his
blood
i
was
thought
a
pleasant
fellow
that
is
to
say
who
could
make
himself
agreeable
and
i
certainly
had
too
and
i
am
not
ashamed
to
say
this
but
one
single
ambition
in
the
world
and
that
was
to
serve
god
cause
and
these
things
do
not
always
go
together
in
this
world
last
of
all
it
must
be
observed
that
no
very
weighty
secrets
were
entrusted
to
me
i
bore
no
letters
and
i
had
been
told
no
more
of
affairs
in
general
than
such
as
any
quick
and
intelligent
man
might
pick
up
for
himself
even
should
i
prove
untrustworthy
or
indiscreet
or
even
turn
traitor
no
very
great
harm
would
be
done
if
upon
the
other
hand
i
proved
ready
and
capable
all
that
i
could
learn
in
england
and
later
perhaps
in
france
would
serve
me
well
in
the
carrying
out
of
weightier
designs
that
might
then
be
given
into
my
charge
such
then
i
was
and
such
was
my
mission
on
this
fifteenth
day
of
june
as
i
rode
up
with
james
my
man
a
servant
found
for
me
in
rome
who
had
once
been
in
the
service
of
my
lord
stafford
to
the
door
of
the
lodgings
engaged
for
me
in
covent
garden
piazza
above
a
jeweller
shop
it
was
after
sunset
that
we
came
there
and
all
the
way
along
the
strand
until
we
nearly
reached
the
york
stairs
i
had
said
nothing
to
my
man
but
had
used
my
eyes
instead
striving
to
remember
what
i
could
of
seven
years
before
the
houses
of
great
folk
were
for
the
most
part
on
my
left
italianate
in
design
with
the
river
seen
between
them
and
lesser
houses
of
the
architecture
that
is
called
magpie
on
the
right
the
way
was
very
foul
for
there
had
been
rain
that
morning
and
there
seemed
nothing
to
carry
the
filth
away
in
places
faggots
had
been
thrown
down
to
enable
carts
to
pass
over
the
strand
was
very
full
of
folk
of
all
kinds
going
back
to
their
houses
for
supper
covent
garden
piazza
was
a
fairer
place
altogether
it
was
enclosed
in
railings
and
a
stood
in
the
centre
and
on
the
south
was
the
space
for
the
market
with
a
cobbled
pavement
to
the
east
of
church
stood
the
greater
houses
built
on
arcades
where
many
fashionable
people
of
the
court
lived
or
had
their
lodgings
and
it
was
in
one
of
these
that
i
too
was
to
lodge
for
i
had
bidden
my
cousin
jermyn
to
do
the
best
he
could
for
me
and
his
letter
had
reached
me
at
dover
telling
me
to
what
place
i
was
to
come
as
i
sat
on
my
horse
waiting
while
my
man
went
in
to
one
of
the
doorways
to
inquire
a
gentleman
ran
suddenly
out
of
another
with
no
hat
on
his
head
why
you
are
my
cousin
roger
are
you
not
he
cried
from
the
steps
then
you
are
my
cousin
tom
jermyn
i
said
the
very
man
he
cried
back
and
ran
down
to
hold
my
stirrup
all
the
way
up
the
stairs
he
was
talking
and
i
was
observing
him
he
seemed
a
hearty
kind
of
fellow
enough
with
a
sunburnt
face
from
living
in
the
country
and
he
wore
his
own
hair
he
was
still
in
and
he
told
me
before
we
had
reached
the
first
landing
that
he
was
come
but
an
hour
ago
from
his
house
at
hare
street
in
hertfordshire
and
i
have
brought
little
dorothy
with
me
he
cried
you
remember
little
dorothy
she
is
a
lady
of
quality
now
aged
no
less
than
sixteen
and
is
come
up
to
renew
her
for
her
cousin
arrival
for
you
must
come
down
with
us
to
hare
street
when
your
business
is
done
i
can
not
say
that
even
after
all
this
heartiness
i
thought
very
much
of
my
cousin
tom
he
spoke
too
loud
i
thought
on
the
common
stair
but
i
forgot
all
that
when
i
came
into
the
room
that
was
already
lighted
with
a
pair
of
wax
candles
and
set
eyes
on
my
cousin
dorothy
who
stood
up
as
we
came
in
still
in
her
with
her
whip
and
gloves
on
the
table
now
let
me
once
and
for
all
describe
my
cousin
dorothy
and
then
i
need
say
no
more
she
was
sixteen
years
old
at
this
time
as
her
father
had
just
told
me
she
was
of
a
pale
skin
with
blue
eyes
and
black
lashes
and
black
hair
but
she
too
was
greatly
sunburnt
with
the
haymaking
as
her
father
presently
told
me
again
for
she
spoke
very
little
after
we
had
saluted
one
another
she
was
in
a
green
skirt
and
a
skirted
doublet
of
the
same
colour
and
wore
a
green
hat
with
a
white
feather
but
those
things
i
did
not
remember
till
i
was
gone
to
bed
and
was
thinking
of
her
it
is
a
hard
business
for
a
lover
to
speak
as
he
should
of
the
maid
who
first
taught
him
his
lessons
in
that
art
but
i
think
it
was
her
silence
and
the
look
in
her
eyes
that
embodied
for
me
at
first
what
i
found
so
dear
afterwards
she
was
neither
tall
nor
short
she
was
very
slender
and
she
moved
without
noise
all
these
things
i
write
down
now
from
my
remembrance
of
the
observations
that
i
made
afterwards
it
would
be
foolish
to
say
that
i
loved
her
so
soon
as
i
saw
her
for
no
man
does
that
in
reality
whatever
he
may
say
of
it
later
i
was
aware
only
that
here
was
a
maid
whose
presence
made
the
little
room
very
pleasant
to
me
and
with
whom
taking
supper
would
be
something
more
than
the
swallowing
of
food
and
drink
the
rooms
of
my
lodging
were
good
enough
as
i
saw
when
my
cousin
tom
flung
open
the
doors
to
show
me
them
all
they
were
three
in
number
this
room
into
which
we
had
first
come
from
the
stairs
was
hung
in
green
damask
with
candles
in
sconces
between
the
panels
of
the
stuff
the
door
on
the
left
opened
into
the
room
where
my
cousin
dorothy
would
lie
with
her
maid
and
that
on
the
right
my
cousin
tom
and
i
would
share
between
us
the
windows
of
all
three
looked
out
upon
the
piazza
he
said
a
great
number
of
times
that
he
was
sorry
that
he
had
brought
up
his
daughter
without
giving
me
warning
but
that
the
maid
had
set
her
heart
on
it
and
would
take
no
denial
this
i
presently
discovered
to
be
wholly
false
for
a
week
he
said
and
no
more
i
should
be
discommoded
and
after
that
when
i
had
come
back
from
hare
street
i
should
be
able
to
entertain
my
friends
in
peace
i
answered
him
of
course
with
the
proper
compliments
but
i
liked
his
manner
less
than
ever
he
was
too
boisterous
i
thought
on
a
first
meeting
and
too
hearty
in
his
expressions
of
goodwill
when
we
were
set
down
to
supper
he
began
again
with
what
i
thought
a
good
deal
of
indiscretion
so
you
are
come
from
rome
he
said
loudly
and
from
a
monastery
too
as
i
hear
well
no
man
loves
a
monk
more
than
i
do
in
their
monasteries
but
i
am
glad
you
are
not
to
be
one
we
will
teach
him
better
here
eh
dolly
my
dear
it
was
only
my
man
james
who
was
in
the
room
when
he
spoke
yet
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
out
to
fetch
another
dish
i
thought
i
had
best
say
a
word
cousin
i
said
with
your
leave
i
think
it
best
not
to
speak
of
monasteries
he
interrupted
me
why
you
need
fear
nothing
he
cried
we
catholics
are
all
in
the
fashion
these
days
why
there
is
huddleston
that
goes
about
in
his
priest
habit
and
the
capuchins
at
james
and
the
very
jesuits
too
i
think
it
would
be
better
not
i
began
oho
cried
cousin
tom
that
is
in
the
wind
is
it
why
i
be
as
mum
as
a
mouse
i
did
not
know
what
he
meant
and
i
supposed
that
he
did
not
know
himself
unless
indeed
by
sheer
blundering
he
had
pitched
upon
the
truth
that
i
was
come
on
a
mission
but
so
soon
as
james
was
in
the
room
again
he
began
upon
the
other
tack
and
talked
of
prince
this
and
the
duke
of
that
with
whom
i
might
be
supposed
to
be
on
terms
of
intimacy
winking
on
me
all
the
while
so
that
my
man
saw
it
however
i
answered
him
civilly
i
could
do
no
less
for
he
was
my
cousin
and
in
a
manner
my
host
and
most
of
all
i
must
depend
upon
him
for
a
few
days
at
least
to
tell
me
how
i
must
set
about
my
audiences
and
my
personal
affairs
my
cousin
dorothy
said
little
or
nothing
all
this
time
but
sat
with
downcast
eyes
giving
a
look
now
and
again
at
the
table
to
see
if
we
had
all
that
we
needed
for
she
was
housekeeper
at
hare
street
her
mother
having
died
ten
years
before
and
she
herself
being
the
only
child
she
did
not
look
at
me
at
all
or
shew
any
displeasure
and
yet
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
was
not
best
pleased
with
her
father
manners
once
towards
the
end
of
supper
when
james
came
behind
him
with
the
i
saw
her
shake
her
head
at
him
and
indeed
cousin
tom
was
already
pretty
red
in
the
face
with
all
that
he
had
drunk
when
the
meal
was
finished
at
last
and
the
table
cleared
and
the
servants
gone
downstairs
to
their
own
supper
he
began
again
with
his
talk
stretching
his
legs
in
the
where
he
sat
while
i
sat
still
in
my
chair
wheeled
away
from
the
table
and
my
cousin
dorothy
went
in
and
out
of
the
rooms
bestowing
the
luggage
that
she
and
her
maid
had
unpacked
i
watched
her
as
she
went
to
and
fro
telling
myself
as
some
lads
will
who
pride
themselves
on
being
come
to
manhood
that
she
was
only
a
little
maid
as
to
your
affairs
cousin
roger
he
said
they
will
soon
be
determined
i
take
it
that
when
you
have
kissed
his
majesty
hand
and
paid
your
duty
to
the
duke
you
will
have
done
all
that
you
should
for
the
present
i
did
not
contradict
him
but
he
was
not
to
be
restrained
you
are
come
to
seek
your
fortune
no
doubt
he
winked
on
me
again
as
he
said
this
to
draw
attention
to
his
discretion
and
there
is
nothing
else
in
the
world
but
that
no
doubt
that
brings
you
to
england
he
said
this
with
an
evident
irony
that
even
a
child
would
have
understood
not
that
you
have
not
a
very
pretty
fortune
already
i
understand
that
it
is
near
upon
a
thousand
pounds
a
year
and
great
estates
in
normandy
too
when
you
shall
be
years
old
i
am
right
am
i
not
now
he
was
right
but
i
wondered
that
he
should
take
such
pains
to
know
it
all
there
or
thereabouts
i
said
that
condition
of
years
is
a
strange
one
he
went
on
now
what
made
your
poor
father
fix
upon
that
i
wonder
i
told
him
that
my
father
held
that
a
man
life
went
by
sevens
and
that
every
man
was
a
boy
till
he
was
a
fool
till
he
was
and
a
man
by
god
grace
after
that
ah
that
was
it
was
it
he
said
stretching
his
legs
yet
further
i
have
often
wondered
as
to
how
that
was
and
that
shewed
me
that
his
mind
must
have
run
a
good
deal
upon
my
fortunes
but
as
yet
i
did
not
understand
the
reason
when
presently
my
cousin
dorothy
had
shut
the
door
of
her
room
and
my
man
was
gone
down
again
to
the
horses
he
began
again
on
his
old
tack
you
and
i
cousin
roger
he
said
will
soon
understand
one
another
i
knew
that
as
soon
as
i
clapped
eyes
on
you
come
tell
me
what
your
business
is
here
i
as
close
as
the
grave
over
a
friend
secrets
my
dear
cousin
i
said
i
do
not
know
what
business
you
mean
was
not
my
letter
explicit
enough
i
am
come
to
live
here
as
an
english
gentleman
what
other
business
should
i
have
he
winked
again
at
me
yes
yes
he
said
and
now
having
done
your
duty
to
your
discretion
do
it
to
your
friendship
for
me
too
i
know
very
well
that
a
man
who
comes
from
a
roman
monastery
with
letters
from
the
french
ambassador
does
not
come
for
nothing
is
there
some
new
scheme
on
hand
for
the
honour
of
holy
church
no
doubt
i
thanked
god
then
that
i
had
said
not
one
word
in
my
letter
that
shaftesbury
himself
might
not
have
read
i
had
been
in
two
minds
about
it
but
had
determined
to
wait
until
i
saw
my
cousin
and
learned
for
myself
what
kind
of
man
he
was
my
dear
cousin
i
said
again
even
if
i
had
come
on
some
such
mission
i
should
assure
you
as
i
do
now
that
it
was
nothing
of
the
kind
how
else
could
such
missions
be
kept
secret
at
all
it
would
be
a
in
any
case
as
the
theologians
would
say
i
can
but
repeat
what
i
said
in
my
letter
to
you
and
if
you
will
think
of
it
you
will
see
that
it
is
not
likely
that
any
matter
of
importance
would
be
entrusted
to
a
young
man
of
my
age
that
seemed
to
quiet
him
i
have
often
noticed
that
to
appeal
to
the
experience
and
wisdom
of
a
fool
is
the
surest
way
to
content
him
he
began
then
to
talk
of
the
court
and
it
would
not
be
decent
of
me
to
record
even
a
tenth
part
of
the
gossip
he
told
me
regarding
the
corruption
that
prevailed
in
whitehall
much
of
it
was
no
doubt
true
and
a
great
deal
more
than
he
told
me
in
some
matters
but
it
came
pouring
out
from
him
and
with
such
evident
pleasure
to
himself
that
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
preserve
a
pleasant
face
towards
him
he
told
me
of
the
little
nell
gwyn
who
was
now
just
years
old
and
how
she
lived
here
and
there
as
the
king
gave
her
houses
in
pall
mall
and
in
sandford
house
in
chelsea
and
at
first
at
the
cock
and
pie
in
drury
lane
and
how
her
hair
was
of
a
reddish
brown
and
how
when
she
laughed
her
eyes
disappeared
in
her
head
and
of
the
duchess
of
cleveland
that
was
once
palmer
and
then
my
lady
castlemaine
now
in
france
and
of
the
duchess
of
portsmouth
and
her
son
created
duke
of
richmond
three
years
ago
and
of
the
mock
marriage
that
was
celebrated
in
my
lord
arlington
house
at
euston
seven
years
ago
between
her
and
the
king
and
these
things
were
only
the
more
decent
matters
of
which
he
spoke
and
of
all
he
spoke
with
that
kind
of
chuckling
pleasure
that
a
heavy
country
squire
usually
shews
in
such
things
so
that
i
nearly
hated
him
as
he
sat
there
for
to
myself
such
things
seem
infinitely
sorrowful
and
all
the
more
so
in
such
a
man
as
the
king
was
and
they
seemed
the
more
sorrowful
the
more
that
i
knew
of
him
later
for
he
had
so
much
of
the
supernatural
in
him
after
all
and
knew
what
he
did
then
presently
my
cousin
jermyn
began
upon
the
duke
and
at
that
i
nearly
loosed
my
tongue
at
him
altogether
for
i
knew
very
well
that
the
guilt
of
the
duke
was
heavier
even
than
the
guilt
of
the
king
since
james
had
the
grace
of
the
sacraments
to
help
him
and
the
light
of
the
faith
to
guide
him
but
i
judged
it
better
not
to
shew
my
anger
since
i
was
as
the
holy
father
had
told
me
to
be
in
the
world
though
interiorly
not
of
it
and
so
i
feigned
sleep
instead
and
presently
had
to
snore
aloud
before
my
cousin
could
see
it
and
as
he
stopped
speaking
my
cousin
dorothy
came
in
to
bid
us
why
i
have
been
half
asleep
i
said
i
am
tired
with
my
journey
what
were
you
saying
cousin
he
leered
again
at
that
as
if
to
draw
attention
to
his
presence
why
we
were
talking
of
high
matters
of
state
he
said
when
you
fell
asleep
matters
too
high
for
little
maids
to
hear
of
give
me
a
kiss
my
dear
when
she
came
to
me
i
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
and
not
upon
the
cheek
which
she
offered
me
is
that
the
italian
custom
cried
my
cousin
tom
why
we
can
teach
you
better
than
that
eh
dolly
she
said
nothing
to
that
but
looked
at
me
a
little
anxiously
and
then
at
the
table
where
the
wine
stood
and
i
thought
that
i
understood
her
well
cousin
i
said
i
too
had
best
be
off
to
bed
we
had
best
both
go
i
do
not
want
to
lie
awake
half
the
night
and
if
you
wake
me
when
you
come
to
bed
i
shall
not
sleep
again
he
tried
to
persuade
me
to
stay
and
drink
a
little
more
but
i
would
not
and
for
very
courtesy
he
had
to
come
with
me
in
spite
of
my
drowsiness
however
when
i
was
once
in
bed
and
the
light
was
out
i
could
not
at
once
sleep
i
heard
the
watchman
go
by
and
cry
that
it
was
a
fine
night
and
i
heard
the
carriages
go
by
and
the
chairs
and
saw
the
light
of
the
links
on
the
ceiling
at
the
end
of
my
bed
and
i
heard
a
brawl
once
and
the
clash
of
swords
and
the
scream
of
a
woman
as
well
as
the
snoring
of
my
cousin
tom
who
fell
asleep
at
once
so
full
he
was
of
french
wine
but
it
was
not
these
things
that
kept
me
awake
except
so
far
as
they
were
signs
to
me
of
where
i
was
for
here
i
was
in
london
at
last
which
whatever
men
may
say
is
the
heart
of
the
world
as
rome
is
the
heart
of
the
church
and
there
within
a
gunshot
was
the
gate
of
whitehall
where
the
king
lived
and
where
my
fortunes
lay
neither
was
i
here
as
a
mere
englishman
come
home
again
after
seven
years
but
as
a
messenger
from
the
holy
see
with
work
both
to
find
and
to
do
i
must
set
out
to
buy
as
i
may
say
the
munitions
of
war
my
clothes
and
my
new
periwigs
and
my
swords
and
my
horses
and
then
after
that
my
holy
war
was
to
begin
i
had
my
letters
not
only
to
the
court
but
to
the
jesuits
as
well
though
of
these
i
had
been
careful
to
say
nothing
to
my
cousin
for
i
could
present
these
very
well
without
his
assistance
and
this
holy
war
i
was
to
carry
on
by
my
own
wits
though
a
soldier
in
that
great
army
of
christ
that
fights
continually
with
spiritual
weapons
against
the
deceits
of
satan
i
wondered
then
as
i
lay
there
in
the
dark
as
to
whether
this
war
would
be
as
bloodless
as
seemed
likely
whether
indeed
it
were
true
and
if
true
whether
it
were
good
or
bad
that
catholics
should
again
almost
be
in
the
fashion
as
my
cousin
had
said
there
were
still
those
old
bloody
laws
against
us
was
it
so
sure
that
they
would
never
be
revived
again
and
if
they
were
revived
how
should
i
bear
myself
and
how
would
my
cousin
jermyn
and
all
those
other
catholics
of
whom
london
was
so
full
of
all
these
things
then
i
thought
but
my
last
thoughts
before
i
commended
myself
finally
to
god
and
our
lady
were
of
my
cousin
dorothy
that
little
maid
as
i
feigned
to
myself
to
think
of
her
yes
i
would
go
down
to
hare
street
in
hertfordshire
so
soon
as
i
conveniently
could
without
neglecting
my
business
it
would
be
pleasant
to
see
what
place
it
was
that
my
cousin
dorothy
called
her
home
chapter
ii
it
was
again
a
fair
evening
five
days
later
when
in
one
of
my
new
suits
with
my
new
sword
i
set
out
on
foot
to
whitehall
to
see
the
king
first
and
the
duke
afterwards
as
word
had
been
brought
me
from
the
chamberlain
office
for
i
had
presented
my
letters
on
the
morning
after
i
had
come
to
london
those
four
days
had
passed
busily
and
merrily
enough
in
company
with
my
cousins
the
first
two
days
i
had
spent
in
the
shops
and
had
expended
above
forty
pounds
with
both
my
cousins
to
advise
me
it
would
not
be
to
the
purpose
to
describe
all
that
i
bought
but
there
was
a
blue
suit
i
had
that
was
made
very
quickly
and
that
was
the
one
i
wore
when
i
went
to
see
the
king
that
was
very
fine
all
was
of
blue
the
coat
was
with
deep
skirts
and
had
great
laced
cuffs
that
turned
up
as
high
as
the
elbow
showing
the
ruffled
wristbands
of
the
shirt
beneath
the
waistcoat
below
in
the
new
fashion
was
so
hung
as
to
come
down
to
my
knees
and
both
coat
and
waistcoat
had
buttons
all
the
way
down
the
front
with
silver
trimming
my
stockings
for
the
brodequins
were
out
of
fashion
again
now
were
of
a
darker
blue
and
my
shoes
of
strong
leather
with
a
great
rosette
upon
each
for
buckles
were
not
usual
at
this
time
then
my
cravat
was
of
flanders
lace
and
my
cousin
dorothy
showed
me
how
to
fasten
it
so
that
the
ends
lay
down
square
in
front
and
my
hat
was
round
with
a
blue
favour
in
it
upon
the
left
side
and
i
wore
it
with
what
was
called
the
monmouth
cock
i
carried
a
long
cane
in
my
hand
with
a
silver
head
and
a
pair
of
soft
leather
gloves
without
cuffs
to
them
then
as
my
own
hair
was
still
short
i
bought
a
couple
of
dark
periwigs
of
my
own
colour
and
put
on
the
better
to
go
to
whitehall
in
besides
these
things
i
had
three
other
suits
one
very
plain
of
grey
and
two
less
plain
a
case
of
pistols
and
a
second
sword
very
plain
and
strong
in
a
leather
scabbard
with
its
belt
two
pair
of
besides
other
shoes
and
two
dozen
of
shirts
and
cravats
of
which
half
were
plain
without
lace
while
we
went
to
and
fro
on
all
those
businesses
we
saw
something
both
of
the
town
and
of
the
folks
on
our
way
back
from
cheapside
one
day
we
turned
aside
to
see
the
monument
with
the
lying
inscription
upon
it
and
then
to
see
the
cathedral
which
was
already
of
a
considerable
height
of
the
persons
of
importance
we
saw
one
day
the
duke
of
buckingham
in
his
coach
drawn
by
two
white
horses
with
riders
before
and
behind
pass
along
towards
whitehall
and
a
chair
went
by
us
one
evening
in
which
it
was
said
was
the
duchess
of
portsmouth
once
madame
de
la
querouaille
or
carwell
but
it
was
so
closely
guarded
that
i
could
not
see
within
also
we
saw
my
lord
shaftesbury
a
sly
yet
proud
looking
fellow
i
thought
him
walking
with
pepys
who
fell
later
under
suspicion
of
being
a
catholic
because
his
servant
was
one
on
the
saturday
evening
we
went
to
take
the
air
in
james
park
and
walked
by
rosamund
pond
and
here
we
but
just
missed
seeing
the
king
and
queen
for
as
we
came
into
it
from
charing
cross
where
i
had
seen
for
the
first
time
in
the
public
street
the
which
i
think
must
take
its
origin
from
pontius
pilate
their
majesties
rode
out
hand
in
hand
i
heard
later
through
the
park
gate
into
the
and
so
to
whitehall
with
guards
in
buff
and
steel
following
there
was
a
great
company
of
gentlemen
and
ladies
who
rode
behind
of
whom
we
caught
a
sight
but
they
were
too
far
away
for
us
to
recognize
any
of
them
i
saw
too
the
come
in
from
tothill
fields
on
the
sunday
morning
we
went
all
three
together
to
hear
mass
sung
in
james
and
here
for
the
first
time
i
saw
huddleston
who
was
of
the
congregation
who
was
in
his
priest
habit
as
my
cousin
had
told
me
for
this
was
allowed
to
him
by
act
of
parliament
because
he
had
saved
the
king
life
after
the
battle
of
worcester
he
was
a
man
that
looked
like
a
scholar
but
was
very
brown
with
the
sun
too
we
could
not
see
the
duke
for
he
was
in
his
closet
with
the
curtains
half
drawn
a
tribune
as
we
should
call
it
in
rome
it
was
very
sweet
to
me
to
hear
mass
again
after
my
journey
and
it
was
not
less
sweet
to
me
that
my
cousin
dorothy
was
beside
me
but
the
crush
was
so
great
of
protestants
who
had
come
to
see
the
ceremonies
as
well
as
of
catholics
that
there
was
scarcely
room
even
to
kneel
down
at
the
elevation
on
our
way
back
we
saw
prince
rupert
a
fat
man
driving
out
in
his
coach
he
spent
all
his
time
in
chymical
experiments
i
was
told
as
sedley
said
he
had
exchanged
naseby
for
noseby
i
had
been
bidden
on
the
monday
to
present
myself
first
at
chiffinch
lodgings
that
were
near
the
chapel
between
the
privy
stairs
and
the
palace
stairs
and
as
i
was
before
my
time
when
i
came
into
the
court
behind
the
banqueting
hall
i
turned
aside
to
see
the
privy
garden
a
fellow
in
livery
of
whom
there
were
half
a
dozen
in
sight
asked
me
my
business
very
civilly
and
when
i
told
him
let
me
go
through
by
the
treasury
and
the
king
laboratory
so
that
i
might
see
the
garden
and
indeed
it
was
very
well
worth
seeing
there
were
sixteen
great
beds
set
in
the
rectangle
with
paved
walks
between
there
was
a
stone
vase
on
a
pedestal
or
a
statue
in
the
centre
of
each
bed
and
a
great
sundial
in
the
midst
of
them
all
there
were
some
ladies
walking
at
the
further
end
beneath
the
two
rows
of
trees
and
the
sight
was
a
very
pretty
one
for
the
sunlight
was
still
on
part
of
the
garden
and
on
the
beyond
the
trees
and
the
flowers
and
the
dresses
and
the
high
windows
that
flashed
back
the
light
all
conspired
to
make
what
i
looked
upon
very
beautiful
the
lodgings
that
looked
on
to
the
privy
garden
and
the
were
much
coveted
i
heard
later
and
only
such
personages
as
prince
rupert
my
lord
peterborough
sir
philip
killigrew
and
such
like
could
get
them
there
chiffinch
lodgings
when
i
came
to
them
were
not
so
fine
for
they
looked
out
upon
little
courts
on
both
sides
and
my
lady
arlington
lodgings
blocked
his
view
to
the
river
i
went
up
the
stairs
and
beat
upon
the
door
with
my
cane
and
a
voice
cried
to
me
to
enter
now
i
had
heard
enough
of
chiffinch
to
make
me
prejudge
him
for
his
main
business
it
seemed
was
to
pander
to
the
king
pleasures
and
he
had
his
rooms
so
near
the
river
it
was
said
that
he
might
more
easily
meet
those
who
came
by
water
and
take
them
up
to
his
majesty
rooms
unobserved
yet
when
i
saw
him
i
understood
that
any
prejudgement
was
unnecessary
for
if
ever
man
bore
his
character
in
his
face
it
was
chiffinch
he
had
risen
at
my
knock
and
was
standing
in
the
light
of
the
window
he
was
dressed
in
a
dark
suit
very
plain
yet
of
very
rich
stuff
and
had
laid
his
periwig
aside
so
that
i
could
see
his
features
he
was
a
dark
man
with
his
eyes
set
near
together
and
with
a
lip
so
short
that
it
seemed
as
if
he
sneered
he
stooped
a
little
too
yet
i
am
bound
to
say
that
his
manner
was
perfection
itself
chiffinch
i
said
and
at
that
he
bowed
i
am
roger
mallock
i
said
and
i
was
bidden
to
come
here
at
this
hour
i
am
honoured
to
meet
you
mallock
he
said
i
have
had
his
majesty
instructions
very
particular
in
your
regard
i
am
ashamed
that
you
should
find
me
so
unready
but
i
will
not
keep
you
above
five
minutes
if
you
will
sit
down
for
a
little
he
made
haste
to
set
me
a
chair
near
the
window
and
with
another
apology
or
two
he
went
out
of
a
second
door
the
room
in
which
he
left
me
was
like
the
suit
that
he
wore
in
that
it
was
both
plain
and
rich
there
were
three
or
four
chairs
with
arms
a
table
with
twisted
legs
on
which
lay
a
great
heap
of
papers
and
a
pair
of
candlesticks
and
there
was
a
tall
press
with
locks
between
the
windows
the
walls
were
plain
with
a
few
good
engravings
hung
upon
them
i
went
up
to
examine
one
and
found
it
to
be
a
new
one
by
faithorne
now
that
i
was
drawing
so
near
to
the
king
i
found
my
apprehensions
returning
upon
me
for
half
my
success
i
knew
if
not
all
turned
upon
the
manner
i
first
shewed
to
him
i
knew
very
well
that
i
could
bear
myself
with
sufficient
address
but
sufficient
address
was
not
all
that
was
needed
i
must
so
act
that
his
majesty
would
remember
me
afterwards
and
with
pleasure
yet
how
was
i
to
ensure
this
as
i
was
so
thinking
to
myself
chiffinch
came
in
again
having
with
marvellous
speed
changed
his
suit
into
one
of
brown
velvet
with
a
great
black
periwig
from
which
his
sharp
face
looked
out
like
a
ferret
from
a
hole
i
must
ask
your
pardon
mallock
he
said
as
i
stood
up
to
meet
him
again
and
again
but
i
have
scarcely
an
hour
to
myself
day
or
night
duty
treads
on
the
heels
of
duty
all
day
long
but
we
have
still
time
his
majesty
does
not
expect
us
till
five
i
made
the
usual
compliments
and
answers
to
which
he
bowed
again
and
then
as
i
thought
he
would
he
began
upon
what
was
not
his
business
at
least
i
thought
not
then
you
are
come
from
rome
i
hear
i
trust
that
his
holiness
was
in
good
health
the
reports
were
excellent
i
said
determined
not
to
be
taken
in
this
way
you
have
seen
his
holiness
lately
no
doubt
it
was
the
french
and
spanish
ambassadors
i
said
who
gave
me
my
letters
a
poor
gentleman
like
myself
does
not
see
the
holy
father
once
in
a
twelvemonth
he
seemed
contented
with
that
and
i
think
he
put
me
down
as
something
of
a
simpleton
which
was
precisely
what
i
wished
him
to
think
for
his
manner
changed
a
little
you
have
seen
his
majesty
before
no
doubt
i
have
not
been
in
england
for
seven
years
i
said
smiling
i
saw
his
majesty
once
when
i
was
a
lad
as
he
went
to
dinner
and
i
have
seen
him
once
on
saturday
last
at
least
i
saw
the
top
of
his
hat
from
a
hundred
yards
off
and
the
duke
of
york
he
asked
i
have
never
seen
the
duke
of
york
in
my
life
to
my
knowledge
i
said
now
i
saw
well
enough
what
he
was
after
without
a
doubt
he
had
a
suspicion
that
i
was
an
emissary
in
some
way
from
the
holy
father
or
at
least
that
i
was
more
than
i
appeared
to
be
and
being
one
of
those
men
who
desire
to
know
everything
that
they
may
understand
as
the
saying
is
which
way
the
cat
will
jump
and
how
to
jump
with
her
he
was
determined
to
find
out
all
that
he
could
on
my
side
therefore
i
assumed
the
air
of
a
rather
stupid
gentleman
to
bear
out
better
the
character
that
i
had
that
i
was
a
mere
gentleman
from
rome
recommended
by
the
catholic
ambassadors
and
i
think
that
for
the
time
at
anyrate
he
took
me
so
to
be
for
his
manner
became
less
inquisitive
we
must
be
going
to
his
majesty
sir
he
said
presently
rising
and
then
he
added
as
if
by
chance
you
are
a
catholic
mr
mallock
why
yes
i
said
for
there
was
no
need
of
any
concealment
on
the
point
of
my
religion
as
we
went
downstairs
and
along
the
passage
that
led
by
sir
francis
clinton
lodgings
he
began
to
speak
of
how
i
was
to
behave
myself
to
the
king
and
how
kiss
his
hand
and
the
rest
i
knew
very
well
all
these
things
but
i
listened
to
him
as
if
i
did
not
and
even
put
a
question
or
two
and
he
answered
me
very
graciously
you
should
be
very
modest
with
his
majesty
he
said
if
you
would
please
him
he
likes
not
originals
or
rather
i
would
say
but
it
must
not
be
repeated
that
he
likes
to
be
the
only
original
of
the
company
and
when
chiffinch
said
that
i
knew
that
he
was
lying
to
me
for
the
very
opposite
was
the
truth
and
i
understood
that
he
still
had
his
suspicions
of
me
and
wished
me
to
fail
with
the
king
but
i
nodded
wisely
and
thanked
him
a
couple
of
yeomen
of
the
guard
of
which
body
no
man
was
less
than
six
feet
tall
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
little
stairs
that
led
up
to
the
king
lodgings
and
these
made
no
motion
to
hinder
the
king
page
and
his
companion
so
english
were
they
that
they
did
not
even
turn
their
eyes
as
we
went
through
chiffinch
preceding
me
with
an
apology
at
the
door
on
the
landing
of
the
first
floor
he
turned
to
me
again
before
he
knocked
his
majesty
will
be
within
the
second
room
he
said
will
you
wait
mallock
please
in
this
first
anteroom
and
i
will
go
through
this
is
a
private
reception
by
his
majesty
there
will
be
no
formalities
he
tapped
upon
both
the
doors
that
were
one
inside
the
other
and
then
led
me
through
the
first
chamber
was
very
richly
furnished
though
barely
there
was
a
long
table
with
chairs
about
it
and
he
led
me
to
one
of
these
then
with
a
nod
or
two
he
passed
on
to
a
second
door
tapped
upon
it
softly
and
went
through
closing
it
behind
him
i
heard
a
woman
laugh
as
he
went
through
suddenly
broken
off
there
was
i
supposed
and
as
i
learned
afterwards
to
be
the
case
one
other
way
at
least
out
of
the
king
lodgings
through
his
private
library
where
he
kept
all
his
clocks
and
wheels
and
for
when
after
a
minute
or
two
the
door
opened
again
and
chiffinch
beckoned
me
in
there
was
no
woman
with
the
king
it
was
a
great
room
his
majesty
closet
as
it
was
called
which
he
used
for
such
solitary
life
as
he
led
and
while
i
was
with
him
and
afterwards
upon
other
occasions
i
saw
little
by
little
how
it
was
furnished
the
table
in
the
midst
at
which
his
majesty
wrote
was
all
in
disorder
it
was
piled
high
with
papers
and
books
for
he
would
do
what
writing
or
reading
he
cared
to
do
by
fits
and
starts
the
walls
were
hung
with
panels
of
tapestry
and
tall
curtains
of
brocade
hung
at
the
windows
between
the
panels
were
pictures
hung
upon
the
walls
three
or
four
by
varelst
three
pictures
of
horses
and
dogs
by
hondius
and
a
couple
of
dutch
pictures
by
hoogstraaten
over
the
fireplace
was
a
by
gibbons
and
the
ceiling
was
all
with
gods
and
goddesses
i
suppose
by
verrio
in
the
windows
which
looked
out
on
two
sides
over
the
river
and
into
a
little
court
were
little
tables
covered
with
curious
things
for
his
majesty
delighted
in
such
ingenuities
dutch
figures
in
silver
clockwork
and
the
like
and
a
basket
of
spaniels
lay
beneath
one
of
the
tables
a
second
great
table
stood
against
the
wall
on
the
further
side
from
that
on
which
i
entered
covered
with
retorts
and
instruments
and
behind
it
a
press
and
near
it
sat
the
king
the
floor
was
carpeted
with
rush
matting
loosely
woven
with
rugs
upon
it
but
of
all
these
things
i
saw
little
or
nothing
at
the
first
for
chiffinch
was
gone
out
behind
me
and
i
was
alone
with
his
majesty
one
of
the
spaniels
had
given
a
little
yelp
as
i
came
in
but
disposed
himself
to
sleep
again
now
i
am
not
one
of
those
who
think
that
those
who
are
noble
by
birth
must
always
be
noble
by
character
though
i
know
that
it
should
be
so
i
knew
too
very
well
that
charles
was
less
than
noble
in
a
great
number
of
ways
his
women
did
what
they
liked
with
him
he
would
spend
fortunes
on
those
who
pleased
him
and
did
him
nothing
but
injury
and
would
let
his
faithful
lovers
and
servants
go
starve
he
lived
always
you
would
say
only
for
the
flesh
and
the
pride
of
the
eyes
he
was
careless
and
selfish
and
ungrateful
in
short
he
was
as
dissolute
as
a
man
could
be
or
rather
as
dissolute
as
a
king
could
be
and
that
is
much
more
yet
for
all
this
he
was
a
man
of
an
extraordinary
power
if
he
had
cared
to
use
it
it
was
said
of
him
that
he
could
if
he
would
but
that
he
would
not
and
of
his
brother
that
he
would
if
he
could
but
that
he
could
not
and
i
know
no
better
epigram
on
the
two
than
that
james
was
all
intention
without
success
and
charles
all
success
without
intention
and
so
james
at
the
end
lived
and
died
as
a
saint
though
he
was
far
from
being
one
at
this
time
and
charles
lived
and
died
a
sinner
though
thank
god
a
penitent
one
now
although
i
knew
all
this
well
enough
and
how
charles
private
life
stank
in
the
nostrils
of
god
and
man
i
can
not
describe
how
he
affected
me
with
loyalty
and
compassion
and
even
a
kind
of
love
in
this
little
while
that
i
had
with
him
in
private
nor
how
these
emotions
grew
upon
me
the
more
that
i
knew
him
he
was
sitting
in
his
great
chair
not
yet
dressed
for
supper
for
his
wristbands
were
tumbled
and
turned
back
and
his
huge
dark
brown
periwig
was
ever
so
little
awry
he
was
in
a
dark
suit
with
a
lace
cravat
and
his
rosetted
shoes
were
crossed
one
over
the
other
as
he
sat
the
light
of
the
window
fell
full
upon
him
from
one
side
shewing
his
swarthy
face
his
thin
close
moustaches
and
his
heavy
eyes
under
his
arched
brows
shewing
above
all
that
air
of
strange
and
lovable
melancholy
that
was
so
marked
a
trait
in
those
of
the
stuart
blood
he
smiled
a
little
at
me
but
did
not
move
except
to
put
out
his
hand
i
came
across
the
floor
kneeled
and
kissed
his
hand
then
at
a
motion
from
him
stood
up
again
so
you
are
roger
mallock
he
said
welcome
to
england
roger
mallock
you
bring
good
news
of
his
holiness
i
hope
his
holiness
does
very
well
sir
i
said
we
should
all
do
as
well
if
we
were
as
holy
said
the
king
and
you
come
to
look
after
my
soul
i
am
informed
he
said
this
with
a
kind
of
gravity
that
can
scarcely
be
believed
i
am
no
priest
sir
i
said
if
you
mean
that
i
am
only
a
forerunner
at
the
best
clamantis
in
said
the
king
i
hope
i
shall
be
no
herod
to
cut
off
your
head
but
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
come
to
this
wilderness
and
have
you
seen
my
brother
yet
i
am
to
see
his
royal
highness
immediately
i
said
i
waited
upon
your
majesty
first
poor
james
said
the
king
he
wants
looking
after
i
think
and
what
have
you
come
to
do
in
england
mr
mallock
now
i
felt
that
i
was
cutting
a
poor
figure
at
present
and
that
i
must
say
something
presently
if
i
could
to
make
the
king
remember
me
afterwards
it
appeared
to
me
that
he
was
trying
me
as
he
tried
all
newcomers
to
see
whether
they
would
be
witty
or
amusing
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
i
am
come
to
put
myself
wholly
at
your
majesty
disposal
i
said
come
come
that
better
said
charles
it
is
usually
the
other
way
about
servorum
you
know
and
in
what
manner
do
you
propose
that
i
should
use
you
i
will
clean
your
majesty
shoes
if
you
will
or
i
will
run
errands
in
my
own
or
i
will
sing
psalms
or
ditties
or
i
will
row
in
a
boat
or
i
will
play
tennis
or
fence
i
am
what
is
called
an
accomplished
young
gentleman
sir
now
i
think
i
put
in
a
shade
too
many
clauses
for
i
was
a
little
agitated
but
the
king
face
lightened
up
very
pleasantly
but
i
have
plenty
of
folks
who
can
do
all
that
he
said
in
what
are
you
distinguished
from
the
rest
then
i
determined
on
a
bold
stroke
for
i
knew
that
the
king
liked
such
things
if
they
were
not
too
bold
i
am
a
jesuit
at
heart
sir
i
said
i
desire
to
do
these
things
if
your
majesty
wills
it
so
simply
that
i
may
serve
his
holiness
in
serving
your
majesty
oho
said
charles
and
he
gathered
his
feet
under
him
and
looked
at
me
more
closely
i
met
his
eyes
fairly
and
then
dropped
my
own
oho
that
is
frank
enough
mallock
you
know
all
about
me
i
suppose
you
seem
very
young
for
such
work
how
old
are
you
i
pass
as
sir
but
i
am
only
i
would
that
i
were
said
charles
earnestly
and
so
you
are
a
jesuit
in
disguise
a
wolf
in
sheep
clothing
no
sir
i
am
a
jesuit
at
heart
only
in
that
i
would
do
anything
in
god
cause
but
i
am
rather
a
sheep
in
wolf
clothing
i
was
a
benedictine
novice
till
lately
he
seemed
not
to
hear
me
he
had
dropped
his
chin
on
his
hand
and
was
looking
at
me
as
if
he
were
thinking
of
something
else
so
you
are
come
to
serve
me
he
said
presently
in
any
way
that
i
will
and
you
will
serve
me
only
that
you
may
serve
your
master
better
and
what
wages
do
you
want
none
that
your
majesty
can
give
i
said
better
and
better
said
charles
nor
place
nor
position
only
at
your
majesty
feet
and
what
if
i
kick
you
i
will
look
for
the
halfpence
elsewhere
sir
then
the
king
laughed
outright
in
the
short
harsh
way
he
had
and
i
knew
that
i
had
pleased
him
then
he
stood
up
and
i
saw
that
he
was
taller
than
i
had
thought
he
was
close
upon
six
feet
high
well
mallock
he
said
this
seems
all
very
pleasant
and
satisfactory
you
said
you
would
run
errands
i
suppose
you
mean
to
rome
to
rome
and
back
sir
i
said
or
to
anywhere
else
except
hell
oh
you
draw
the
line
there
do
you
no
sir
it
is
god
almighty
who
has
drawn
it
i
am
not
responsible
but
you
observe
god
his
line
yes
sir
at
least
i
try
to
we
all
do
that
i
suppose
the
pity
is
that
we
do
not
succeed
more
consistently
well
mallock
i
have
nothing
for
you
at
present
i
am
a
great
deal
too
busy
these
ladies
you
know
demand
so
much
i
suppose
you
heard
one
of
them
laugh
just
now
i
hear
nothing
but
your
majesty
commands
i
said
very
meekly
charles
laughed
again
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
well
and
there
are
all
these
clockwork
businesses
and
chymical
and
the
like
and
there
is
so
much
to
eat
and
drink
and
see
and
there
are
the
affairs
of
the
kingdom
i
had
forgot
that
well
i
have
no
time
at
present
mallock
as
you
can
see
for
yourself
but
i
will
not
forget
you
if
i
want
you
where
do
you
lodge
i
named
my
lodgings
in
covent
garden
and
i
have
a
cousin
sir
i
said
who
has
bidden
me
to
his
house
in
hare
street
i
shall
be
here
or
there
his
name
thomas
jermyn
sir
the
king
nodded
i
will
remember
that
he
said
well
it
may
be
a
long
time
before
i
have
anything
more
to
say
to
his
holiness
that
will
not
when
he
may
you
know
all
about
that
i
suppose
mr
mallock
i
know
that
your
majesty
has
the
reunion
of
christendom
at
heart
i
said
discreetly
yes
yes
i
understand
said
charles
i
have
received
very
favourable
accounts
of
you
sir
and
your
letters
which
are
for
the
public
eye
are
perfectly
in
order
well
i
will
remember
mallock
meanwhile
you
had
best
not
shew
yourself
at
court
in
public
too
much
and
this
he
said
very
earnestly
he
put
out
his
hand
to
be
kissed
and
you
will
give
my
compliments
to
my
brother
james
he
said
one
of
the
spaniels
snored
in
his
sleep
as
i
went
out
again
chapter
iii
my
interview
with
the
duke
was
a
very
different
matter
i
was
informed
at
his
lodgings
that
he
was
not
yet
come
from
tennis
and
upon
asking
how
long
he
would
be
or
if
i
might
go
to
the
was
told
that
he
might
be
half
an
hour
yet
and
that
i
might
go
there
if
i
wished
so
i
went
up
from
the
river
again
with
a
fellow
they
sent
to
guide
me
down
through
the
stone
gallery
across
the
privy
garden
and
so
across
the
street
midway
between
the
gates
and
so
by
the
duke
of
monmouth
lodgings
to
the
here
as
i
went
across
the
street
i
caught
sight
of
the
sentries
changing
guard
these
were
the
coldstream
guards
in
their
red
coats
for
it
was
these
who
did
duty
for
the
most
part
in
the
palace
and
round
about
at
the
gates
the
other
troops
about
his
majesty
were
first
the
king
guards
proper
who
attended
him
when
he
rode
out
these
were
in
buff
coats
and
cuirasses
very
well
mounted
and
very
gay
with
ribbons
and
velvet
and
gold
lace
and
what
not
and
to
each
troop
of
these
were
attached
a
company
of
grenadiers
with
their
grenades
besides
these
were
the
blues
also
cavalry
and
the
dragoons
who
were
infantry
on
horseback
and
carried
bayonets
of
the
such
as
the
buffs
most
were
mousquetaires
but
some
trailed
pikes
and
every
one
of
them
had
a
sword
these
troops
i
saw
constantly
in
town
besides
the
yeomen
who
were
closely
attached
to
the
person
of
his
sacred
majesty
it
was
by
the
duke
of
monmouth
lodgings
that
i
had
my
first
sight
of
the
duke
of
monmouth
himself
for
as
i
came
towards
the
archway
by
which
were
the
lodgings
of
my
lady
suffolk
he
himself
came
out
from
his
own
i
did
not
know
who
he
was
until
the
fellow
by
me
saluted
him
and
doffed
his
cap
whereupon
i
did
the
same
i
think
i
have
never
seen
a
more
handsome
lad
in
all
my
life
for
he
looked
no
more
though
he
was
near
thirty
years
old
his
face
was
as
smooth
as
a
girl
though
not
at
all
effeminate
he
had
a
high
and
merry
look
with
him
and
bore
himself
with
his
two
friends
like
a
prince
he
had
violet
eyes
and
arched
brows
over
them
it
is
piteous
to
me
now
to
think
of
his
end
and
that
it
was
against
his
uncle
by
blood
whom
i
was
to
see
presently
that
he
rebelled
later
and
by
his
uncle
that
he
was
condemned
and
it
is
yet
more
piteous
to
think
how
he
met
that
end
crying
and
cringing
for
fear
of
his
life
both
in
the
ditch
in
which
he
was
discovered
and
afterward
in
prison
he
looked
very
kindly
on
me
as
he
passed
lifting
his
hand
to
his
hat
but
i
think
he
would
not
have
so
looked
if
he
had
known
all
about
me
for
he
was
as
venomous
against
the
catholics
as
a
man
could
be
or
at
least
feigned
himself
so
for
i
think
he
had
not
a
great
deal
of
religion
at
any
time
but
he
was
to
know
me
better
afterwards
when
i
came
up
into
the
gallery
of
the
i
found
it
pretty
full
yet
not
so
full
but
that
i
could
get
a
sight
of
the
players
the
duke
was
in
the
court
of
the
when
i
first
came
in
so
i
could
see
no
more
of
him
than
his
back
and
his
cropped
head
but
when
after
two
he
crossed
over
i
had
a
good
view
of
him
he
was
more
heavily
built
than
charles
but
his
features
were
not
unlike
the
king
though
he
was
fairer
in
complexion
i
suppose
and
his
lip
was
shorter
and
he
wore
no
hair
on
his
face
he
had
somewhat
of
a
heavier
look
too
in
his
face
without
the
fire
that
burned
like
embers
in
his
brother
eyes
all
this
i
noticed
somewhat
of
even
from
the
gallery
though
he
was
all
with
his
exercise
i
had
left
word
with
one
of
the
men
below
as
to
my
name
and
my
business
and
when
the
game
was
ended
and
the
duke
went
out
i
remained
still
upstairs
for
a
little
thinking
that
perhaps
another
would
be
played
and
then
perhaps
he
would
send
for
me
but
a
servant
came
up
presently
and
told
me
i
was
to
follow
to
the
stone
gallery
where
the
duke
would
walk
for
a
while
before
changing
his
clothes
as
his
custom
was
this
stone
gallery
as
i
had
seen
was
roofed
with
skylights
in
it
and
had
presses
of
books
all
along
the
walls
together
with
collections
of
all
kinds
when
i
came
to
the
gallery
he
was
at
the
further
end
walking
with
sir
robert
murray
as
i
learned
afterwards
who
was
a
very
earnest
protestant
but
always
at
court
but
when
he
saw
me
he
sent
sir
robert
away
and
beckoned
to
me
to
come
so
i
went
up
to
him
and
kissed
his
hand
and
he
bade
me
walk
with
him
for
a
little
he
had
put
on
a
cloak
and
hat
to
prevent
his
taking
cold
now
his
manner
was
wholly
different
from
his
majesty
there
was
a
courtesy
always
in
charles
that
was
not
in
james
for
the
duke
said
nothing
as
to
his
receiving
me
here
in
his
but
began
immediately
to
talk
in
a
low
voice
i
am
pleased
that
you
are
come
to
england
mallock
i
have
had
news
of
you
from
rome
then
he
asked
very
properly
of
the
holy
father
and
of
a
cardinal
or
two
that
he
knew
and
i
answered
him
as
well
as
i
could
but
i
very
soon
saw
that
his
royal
highness
wanted
nothing
like
wit
from
me
he
was
somewhat
of
a
solemn
man
and
had
great
ideas
of
his
rights
and
that
all
men
who
were
below
his
own
station
should
keep
their
own
he
desired
deference
and
attention
above
all
things
he
spoke
presently
of
catholics
in
england
god
hath
blest
us
very
highly
he
said
both
in
numbers
and
influence
but
we
can
well
do
with
more
of
both
for
i
never
heard
of
any
cause
that
could
not
there
is
a
feeling
against
us
in
many
quarters
but
it
is
less
considerable
every
year
you
are
to
attach
yourself
to
his
majesty
i
understand
but
i
am
to
have
no
place
or
office
sir
i
said
i
am
rather
to
be
at
his
majesty
disposal
to
fetch
and
carry
i
may
say
if
he
should
need
my
services
his
highness
looked
at
me
sidelong
and
swiftly
and
i
understood
that
he
did
not
wish
any
originality
even
in
speech
we
must
all
be
discreet
however
he
said
though
i
suppose
there
was
never
any
man
less
discreet
than
himself
especially
when
he
most
needed
to
be
so
it
is
useless
to
say
that
we
are
altogether
loved
for
we
are
not
but
you
will
soon
acquaint
yourself
with
all
our
politics
i
did
not
say
that
i
had
already
done
so
but
assured
him
that
i
would
do
my
best
as
a
general
guide
i
may
say
he
went
on
where
there
is
whiggery
there
is
disloyalty
however
much
the
whigs
may
protest
they
say
they
desire
a
king
as
much
as
any
but
it
is
not
a
king
that
they
want
but
his
shadow
only
he
talked
on
in
this
manner
for
a
little
for
we
had
the
gallery
to
ourselves
telling
me
what
i
knew
very
well
already
that
the
catholics
and
the
high
churchmen
were
as
a
whole
staunch
royalists
but
that
the
rest
especially
those
of
the
old
covenanting
blood
still
were
capable
of
mischief
he
did
not
tell
me
outright
that
it
was
largely
against
his
own
succession
that
the
disaffection
was
directed
nor
that
the
duke
of
monmouth
was
his
rival
but
he
told
me
enough
to
show
that
my
own
information
was
correct
enough
and
that
in
the
political
matters
my
weight
such
as
it
was
must
be
thrown
on
to
the
side
of
the
tories
as
the
other
party
was
nicknamed
i
understood
even
in
that
first
conversation
with
him
why
he
was
so
little
loved
and
i
remembered
with
inward
mirth
how
his
majesty
once
upon
being
remonstrated
with
by
his
brother
for
walking
out
so
freely
without
a
guard
answered
that
he
need
have
no
fears
for
they
will
never
kill
me
said
he
to
set
you
upon
the
throne
you
have
seen
father
whitbread
no
doubt
said
the
duke
suddenly
no
sir
i
waited
to
pay
my
homage
first
to
his
majesty
and
to
yourself
he
nodded
once
or
twice
at
that
yes
yes
but
you
will
see
him
presently
i
take
it
you
could
not
have
a
better
guide
why
he
broke
off
on
a
sudden
why
here
is
the
man
himself
he
said
a
man
in
a
sober
suit
was
indeed
approaching
as
his
highness
spoke
he
was
of
about
the
of
grave
and
kindly
face
and
resembled
such
a
man
as
a
lawyer
or
physician
might
be
he
was
dressed
in
all
points
like
a
layman
though
i
suppose
it
was
tolerably
well
known
what
he
was
if
not
his
name
he
saluted
as
he
came
near
and
made
as
if
he
would
have
passed
us
whitbread
mr
whitbread
cried
the
duke
the
priest
turned
and
bowed
again
uncovering
as
he
did
so
then
he
came
up
to
the
duke
and
kissed
his
hand
i
was
on
my
way
to
see
your
royal
highness
he
said
but
when
i
saw
you
were
in
company
why
this
is
mallock
come
from
rome
who
has
letters
to
you
this
will
save
you
a
journey
mallock
the
priest
and
i
saluted
one
another
and
i
found
his
face
and
manner
very
pleasant
i
have
heard
of
you
mallock
he
said
but
i
hope
his
highness
is
misinformed
and
that
this
will
not
save
you
a
journey
after
all
i
was
just
telling
this
gentleman
broke
in
the
duke
as
we
continued
our
walking
that
he
must
take
you
for
his
mentor
whitbread
in
these
difficult
times
mallock
seems
very
young
for
his
business
but
i
suppose
that
the
holy
father
knows
what
he
is
about
the
holy
father
sir
i
said
has
committed
himself
in
no
sort
of
way
to
me
i
am
scarcely
more
than
a
who
has
had
his
blessing
well
well
it
is
all
the
same
thing
said
james
a
little
impatiently
or
drilled
soldier
they
fight
for
the
same
cause
he
continued
to
talk
in
the
same
manner
for
a
little
as
if
for
my
instruction
and
i
listened
with
all
the
meekness
i
had
he
did
not
tell
me
one
word
which
i
did
not
already
know
but
i
had
perceived
by
now
what
kind
of
man
he
was
well
intentioned
no
doubt
as
courageous
as
a
lion
and
as
impatient
of
opposition
and
not
a
little
stupid
at
least
he
had
not
a
tenth
of
his
brother
wits
as
all
the
world
knew
he
solemnly
informed
me
therefore
of
what
all
the
world
knew
and
i
listened
to
him
when
he
dismissed
me
at
last
however
he
remembered
to
ask
where
i
lodged
and
i
told
him
a
very
good
place
too
he
said
i
am
glad
your
cousin
had
the
sense
to
put
you
there
then
i
will
remember
you
if
i
need
you
for
anything
i
will
go
with
mallock
said
the
priest
if
your
royal
highness
will
permit
i
came
but
to
pay
my
respects
and
it
is
a
little
late
the
duke
nodded
and
gave
us
his
hand
to
kiss
as
we
went
out
through
the
courtyard
father
whitbread
pointed
out
a
few
things
to
me
which
be
thought
might
be
of
interest
and
i
liked
the
man
more
at
every
step
he
was
a
complete
man
of
the
world
with
a
certain
gentle
irony
yet
none
the
less
kindly
for
it
he
did
not
say
one
disparaging
word
of
anyone
nor
any
hint
of
criticism
at
his
royal
highness
yet
he
knew
and
i
knew
that
he
knew
and
he
knew
that
again
that
our
catholic
champion
was
a
shade
disappointing
and
that
not
in
his
vices
only
of
which
my
lady
southesk
could
have
given
an
account
but
in
that
which
i
am
forced
to
call
his
stupidity
but
after
all
our
saviour
uttered
a
judgment
generally
as
to
the
children
of
light
and
the
children
of
this
world
that
must
always
be
our
consolation
when
our
friends
are
dull
or
perverse
father
whitbread
only
observed
emphatically
that
the
duke
was
a
man
of
excellent
heart
he
showed
me
the
windows
of
a
number
of
lodgings
on
the
way
and
the
direction
of
a
great
many
more
for
indeed
this
palace
of
whitehall
was
liker
a
little
town
than
a
house
father
patricks
he
said
had
a
lodging
near
the
pantry
which
he
shewed
me
there
be
some
of
us
priests
who
have
an
affinity
do
you
not
think
mallock
with
pantries
and
butteries
and
such
like
good
sound
men
too
many
of
them
i
have
not
a
word
to
say
against
mr
patricks
he
shewed
me
too
how
the
palace
was
in
four
quarters
of
which
two
were
divided
from
two
by
whitehall
itself
and
the
street
between
the
gatehouses
that
half
of
it
that
was
nearer
to
the
park
held
the
and
the
and
the
lodgings
of
the
duke
of
monmouth
and
others
nearer
westminster
and
the
other
half
the
horse
guards
and
the
barracks
and
that
nearer
the
river
held
to
the
south
the
stone
gallery
the
privy
garden
the
bowling
green
and
a
great
number
of
lodgings
amongst
which
were
those
of
the
king
and
of
his
brother
and
prince
rupert
and
of
the
queen
too
as
well
as
of
their
more
immediate
attendants
and
this
part
contained
what
was
left
of
the
old
york
house
to
the
north
was
another
court
surrounded
by
lodgings
the
the
two
courts
called
scotland
yard
and
the
at
the
extremity
nearest
charing
cross
in
the
very
midst
of
the
whole
palace
looking
upon
whitehall
itself
was
the
banqueting
house
where
his
majesty
dined
in
state
and
from
a
window
of
which
king
charles
the
first
of
blessed
memory
went
out
to
lose
his
head
indeed
as
we
went
by
the
end
of
the
banqueting
house
the
trumpets
blew
for
supper
and
we
saw
a
great
number
of
cooks
and
scullions
run
past
with
dishes
on
their
heads
as
we
went
up
whitehall
whitbread
began
to
speak
of
more
intimate
things
you
are
a
stranger
in
england
mallock
i
think
i
told
him
i
had
not
been
in
the
country
for
seven
years
you
will
find
a
great
many
changes
he
said
and
i
think
we
are
on
the
eve
of
some
more
certainly
his
majesty
has
wonderfully
established
his
position
and
yet
if
you
understand
me
there
is
a
great
and
growing
disaffection
it
is
the
catholic
faith
that
they
fear
and
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
some
victims
may
be
required
again
presently
though
i
do
not
know
what
they
can
allege
against
us
there
is
a
deal
of
feeling
too
against
the
queen
she
has
borne
no
children
that
is
true
but
the
main
part
of
it
arises
from
her
religion
and
so
with
the
duke
of
york
also
certainly
we
are
in
the
fashion
in
one
way
but
those
who
are
on
the
top
of
the
wave
must
always
look
to
come
down
suddenly
here
again
father
whitbread
did
not
tell
me
anything
that
i
did
not
know
yet
he
put
matters
together
as
i
had
not
heard
them
put
before
and
he
seemed
to
me
altogether
a
shrewd
kind
of
man
whose
judgment
i
might
very
well
rely
upon
and
as
we
went
up
the
strand
he
spoke
again
of
the
queen
his
majesty
hath
been
urged
again
and
again
to
divorce
her
but
he
will
not
he
said
to
the
duke
himself
in
my
hearing
one
day
that
an
innocent
woman
should
never
suffer
through
him
which
is
good
hearing
but
her
majesty
is
not
very
happy
i
am
afraid
when
we
came
to
the
maypole
which
i
had
already
seen
in
the
midst
of
the
strand
he
spoke
to
me
of
how
it
had
been
carried
there
and
set
up
with
great
rejoicing
after
the
restoration
it
was
a
great
structure
hung
about
by
a
crown
and
a
vane
and
he
said
that
it
stood
as
a
kind
of
symbol
against
puritanism
there
are
many
he
told
me
who
would
pull
it
down
if
they
could
as
if
it
were
some
kind
of
idol
he
saw
me
as
far
as
the
door
of
my
lodgings
but
he
would
not
come
in
he
said
that
he
had
no
great
desire
to
be
known
more
widely
than
be
was
at
present
known
but
if
you
have
time
to
come
in
morning
about
ten
to
fenwick
lodgings
in
drury
lane
over
the
baker
shop
i
shall
be
there
and
ireland
also
all
fathers
of
our
society
and
i
will
very
gladly
make
you
known
to
them
my
own
lodgings
are
in
weld
street
at
the
ambassador
i
thanked
him
for
his
kindness
and
said
i
would
be
there
and
so
i
bade
him
although
i
had
learned
very
few
things
that
day
which
i
had
not
known
already
i
felt
that
evening
as
i
sat
at
supper
and
afterwards
in
the
coffee
house
at
fleet
street
which
he
recommended
to
me
that
i
knew
them
in
a
different
manner
for
i
had
spoken
with
some
of
the
principal
actors
and
above
all
with
the
king
himself
my
cousin
questioned
me
delightedly
upon
my
experiences
when
we
were
alone
with
our
pipes
at
one
end
of
the
great
room
that
had
been
a
and
related
to
me
all
his
own
experiences
with
the
king
at
great
length
and
how
charles
had
made
to
him
some
witty
remarks
which
i
think
must
have
lost
in
the
telling
for
they
were
not
witty
at
all
when
i
heard
them
it
appeared
that
my
cousin
had
spoken
with
the
king
three
or
four
times
at
and
such
like
and
he
would
know
all
that
his
majesty
had
said
to
me
but
much
i
would
not
tell
him
and
some
i
could
not
i
could
not
that
is
even
if
i
would
have
conveyed
to
him
the
strange
compassion
that
i
felt
and
the
yet
more
strange
affection
for
this
king
who
might
have
done
so
much
and
who
did
so
little
except
what
he
should
not
and
i
would
not
on
any
account
tell
him
of
what
the
king
had
said
as
to
rome
and
his
desires
and
procrastinations
but
i
told
him
how
i
had
met
father
whitbread
and
how
i
was
to
go
and
see
him
on
the
morrow
why
i
will
come
with
you
myself
he
said
i
know
lodgings
very
well
and
we
will
ride
afterwards
as
far
as
waltham
cross
and
lie
there
and
so
to
hare
street
for
dinner
next
day
all
the
way
home
again
and
when
my
cousin
dorothy
was
gone
to
bed
and
we
sat
over
a
couple
of
tankards
of
college
ale
he
would
talk
of
nothing
but
the
jesuits
they
are
too
zealous
he
said
i
am
as
good
a
catholic
as
any
man
in
england
or
rome
but
i
like
not
this
they
are
everywhere
these
good
fathers
and
it
will
bring
trouble
on
them
they
hold
their
consults
even
in
london
which
i
think
and
no
man
knows
what
passes
at
them
now
i
myself
and
so
his
tongue
wagged
on
telling
of
his
own
excellence
and
prudence
and
even
his
own
spirituality
while
his
eyes
watered
with
the
ale
that
he
drank
and
his
face
grew
ever
more
red
and
yet
there
was
no
true
simplicity
in
the
man
he
had
that
kind
of
cunning
that
is
eked
out
with
winks
and
becks
and
nods
that
all
the
world
could
see
he
talked
of
my
cousin
dorothy
too
and
her
virtues
and
what
a
great
lady
she
would
be
some
day
when
these
virtues
were
known
and
he
declared
that
in
spite
of
this
he
would
never
let
her
go
to
court
and
then
once
more
he
went
back
again
to
his
earlier
talk
of
the
corruptions
there
and
of
what
my
lady
this
and
her
grace
of
that
had
said
and
done
and
thought
fenwick
lodgings
in
drury
lane
were
such
as
any
man
might
have
the
jesuit
fathers
lived
apart
in
london
father
whitbread
in
the
city
father
ireland
in
russell
street
and
father
harcourt
who
was
called
the
rector
of
london
i
heard
in
duke
street
near
the
arch
lest
too
much
attention
should
be
drawn
to
them
if
they
were
all
together
they
were
pleasant
quiet
men
and
received
me
very
kindly
for
my
cousin
who
had
forgot
some
matter
he
had
to
do
before
he
went
into
the
country
was
gone
down
into
the
city
to
see
to
it
grove
whom
i
learned
later
to
be
a
lay
brother
of
the
society
opened
the
door
to
me
and
shewed
me
to
the
room
where
they
were
all
three
together
they
were
all
three
of
them
just
such
men
as
you
might
meet
anywhere
in
or
taverns
none
of
them
under
forty
or
over
sixty
years
old
father
harcourt
was
seventy
but
he
was
not
there
they
were
in
sober
suits
such
as
a
lawyer
might
wear
and
carried
swords
these
were
not
all
the
jesuits
thereabouts
for
i
heard
them
speak
of
father
john
gavan
and
father
anthony
turner
who
were
in
the
country
on
that
day
and
others
as
i
talked
with
them
and
gave
my
news
and
listened
to
theirs
again
and
again
i
thought
of
the
marvellous
misjudgments
that
were
always
passed
upon
the
society
of
how
men
such
as
these
were
always
thought
to
be
plotting
and
conspiring
and
how
any
charge
against
a
jesuit
was
always
taken
as
proven
scarcely
before
it
was
stated
and
that
not
by
common
men
only
but
by
educated
gentlemen
too
who
should
know
better
for
their
talk
was
of
nothing
but
of
the
most
harmless
and
christian
matters
and
of
such
simplicity
that
no
man
who
heard
them
could
doubt
their
sincerity
it
is
true
that
they
spoke
of
such
things
as
the
conversion
of
england
and
of
the
progress
that
the
faith
was
making
and
they
told
many
wonderful
stories
of
the
religion
of
the
common
people
in
country
places
and
how
a
priest
was
received
by
them
as
an
angel
of
god
and
of
their
marvellous
goodness
and
constancy
under
the
bitterest
trials
but
so
i
take
it
would
the
apostles
themselves
have
spoken
in
rome
and
asia
and
jerusalem
but
as
to
the
disloyalty
that
was
afterwards
charged
against
them
still
less
of
any
hatred
or
murderous
designs
there
was
not
one
such
thought
that
passed
through
any
of
their
minds
it
was
a
plain
but
chamber
in
which
we
sat
beneath
the
windows
folks
came
and
went
continually
there
were
hangings
on
the
wall
and
a
press
full
of
books
and
papers
and
two
or
three
tables
but
there
was
no
concealment
of
anything
nor
thought
of
it
through
the
door
i
saw
grove
laying
for
dinner
but
you
will
surely
stay
for
dinner
said
father
fenwick
when
i
said
that
i
must
be
gone
presently
i
told
him
that
i
was
to
ride
to
waltham
cross
with
my
cousins
and
that
i
was
to
meet
them
for
dinner
first
at
the
beside
the
maypole
in
the
strand
and
to
hare
street
then
said
father
whitbread
or
white
as
he
was
called
sometimes
i
told
him
yes
and
that
i
did
not
know
how
long
i
should
be
there
the
king
will
be
at
windsor
next
month
i
think
he
said
but
he
will
be
back
again
for
august
you
had
best
be
within
call
then
if
he
should
send
for
you
for
i
had
told
them
all
freely
what
had
passed
between
myself
and
his
majesty
and
what
his
holiness
had
said
to
me
too
you
can
command
any
of
us
at
any
time
he
added
if
we
can
be
of
service
to
you
there
are
so
many
folks
of
all
kinds
here
there
and
everywhere
that
it
is
near
impossible
for
a
stranger
to
take
stock
of
them
all
and
it
may
be
that
our
experience
may
be
of
use
to
you
to
know
whom
to
trust
and
of
whom
to
beware
but
the
most
safe
rule
in
these
days
is
trust
no
man
till
you
know
him
and
not
entirely
even
then
there
are
men
in
this
city
who
would
sell
their
souls
gladly
if
any
could
be
found
to
give
them
anything
for
it
how
much
more
then
if
they
could
turn
a
penny
or
two
by
selling
you
or
me
or
another
in
their
stead
i
thanked
him
for
his
warning
and
told
him
that
i
would
indeed
be
on
my
guard
least
of
all
he
said
would
i
trust
those
of
my
own
household
i
know
your
cousin
for
a
catholic
mallock
but
you
will
forgive
me
for
saying
that
it
is
from
catholics
that
we
have
to
fear
the
most
i
do
not
mean
by
that
that
jermyn
is
not
excellent
and
sincere
for
i
know
nothing
of
him
except
what
you
have
told
me
yourself
but
zeal
without
discretion
is
a
very
firebrand
and
prudence
without
zeal
may
become
something
very
like
cowardice
and
either
of
these
two
things
may
injure
the
catholic
cause
irreparably
in
the
days
that
are
coming
peter
was
the
one
and
judas
i
take
it
was
the
other
for
i
hold
judas
to
have
been
by
far
the
greater
coward
of
the
two
when
i
came
out
into
the
passage
with
him
i
kneeled
down
and
asked
his
blessing
for
i
knew
that
this
was
of
a
truth
a
man
of
god
chapter
iv
it
was
a
little
after
noon
next
day
that
first
we
saw
the
norman
church
upon
the
hill
and
then
the
roofs
of
hare
street
i
had
been
astonished
at
the
badness
of
the
roads
from
london
coming
as
i
had
from
rome
where
paved
ways
go
out
in
every
direction
we
came
out
by
bishopsgate
by
the
ware
road
and
arrived
at
waltham
cross
a
little
before
sunset
riding
through
heavy
dust
that
had
hardly
been
laid
at
all
by
the
recent
rains
we
rode
armed
with
four
servants
besides
my
cousin
dorothy
maid
for
fear
of
the
highwaymen
who
had
robbed
a
coach
only
last
week
between
ware
and
london
my
cousin
dorothy
rode
a
white
mare
named
jenny
which
mightily
became
her
we
lay
at
the
at
waltham
cross
and
went
out
before
supper
to
see
the
cross
which
was
erected
where
queen
eleanor
body
had
lain
of
which
the
last
was
at
charing
cross
and
i
was
astonished
that
the
puritans
had
not
more
mutilated
it
the
beds
were
pretty
comfortable
and
the
ale
excellent
so
that
once
more
my
cousin
tom
drank
too
much
of
it
and
so
early
in
the
morning
we
took
horse
again
and
rode
through
puckeridge
where
we
left
for
the
first
time
the
road
by
which
the
king
went
to
newmarket
when
he
went
through
royston
and
we
found
the
track
very
bad
thenceforward
my
cousin
tom
carried
with
him
though
for
no
purpose
except
for
show
a
map
by
john
ogilby
which
shows
all
the
way
from
london
to
king
lynn
very
ingeniously
and
which
was
made
after
the
restoration
to
encourage
road
traffic
again
but
it
was
pleasant
for
me
to
look
at
it
from
time
to
time
and
see
what
progress
we
made
towards
hormead
magna
which
is
the
parish
in
which
hare
street
lies
now
it
was
very
pleasant
for
me
to
ride
as
i
did
a
good
deal
with
my
cousin
dorothy
for
her
father
for
a
great
part
rode
with
the
men
and
cracked
stories
with
them
for
journeying
with
a
person
sets
up
a
great
deal
of
intimacy
and
acquaintance
progresses
at
least
as
swiftly
as
the
journey
itself
she
spoke
to
me
very
freely
of
her
father
though
never
as
a
daughter
should
not
and
told
me
how
distressed
she
was
sometimes
at
the
quantity
of
ale
and
strong
waters
that
he
drank
she
told
me
also
how
seldom
it
was
that
a
catholic
could
hear
mass
at
hare
street
sometimes
she
said
a
priest
would
lie
there
and
say
mass
in
the
attic
but
not
very
often
and
sometimes
if
a
priest
were
in
the
neighbourhood
they
would
ride
over
and
hear
mass
wherever
he
happened
to
be
the
house
she
said
lay
near
upon
the
road
so
that
they
would
hear
a
good
deal
of
news
in
this
way
but
she
told
me
nothing
of
another
matter
for
indeed
she
could
not
which
distressed
her
though
i
presently
guessed
it
for
myself
as
will
appear
in
the
course
of
this
tale
my
horse
peter
as
i
had
named
him
after
the
apostle
when
i
bought
him
at
dover
was
pretty
weary
as
we
came
in
sight
of
the
church
of
hormead
parva
for
i
had
given
him
plenty
to
do
while
i
was
in
london
and
he
stumbled
three
or
four
times
we
are
nearly
home
said
my
cousin
dorothy
and
pointed
with
her
whip
it
is
pleasant
to
hear
such
a
word
i
said
for
as
for
me
i
have
none
she
said
nothing
to
that
and
i
was
a
little
ashamed
to
have
said
it
for
nothing
is
easier
than
to
touch
a
maid
heart
by
playing
othello
to
her
desdemona
i
have
no
business
to
have
said
that
cousin
i
went
on
presently
for
england
is
all
home
to
me
just
now
i
hope
you
will
find
it
so
cousin
she
said
the
country
was
pretty
enough
through
which
we
rode
though
in
no
ways
wonderful
it
was
for
the
most
part
with
woods
here
and
there
and
plenty
of
hollow
ways
all
of
which
were
marked
upon
the
map
with
great
accuracy
by
which
drovers
brought
their
sheep
to
the
highway
i
saw
also
a
good
many
fields
of
corn
the
hills
were
lowish
and
ran
in
lines
with
long
valleys
between
and
there
was
one
such
on
the
right
as
we
came
to
hare
street
through
which
flowed
a
little
stream
nearly
dry
in
the
summer
the
house
itself
was
the
greatest
house
in
the
village
and
lay
at
the
further
end
of
it
upon
the
right
sheltered
from
the
road
by
limes
in
the
midst
of
which
was
the
gateway
and
the
house
twenty
yards
within
my
cousin
tom
came
up
with
us
as
we
entered
the
village
and
shewed
me
with
a
great
deal
of
pride
his
new
iron
gate
just
set
up
with
a
twisted
top
it
is
the
finest
little
gate
for
ten
miles
round
he
said
and
cost
me
near
twenty
pound
we
rode
past
the
gate
however
into
the
yard
just
beyond
and
here
there
was
a
great
barking
of
dogs
set
up
and
two
or
three
men
ran
out
i
helped
my
cousin
dorothy
from
her
horse
and
then
all
three
of
us
went
through
a
to
the
front
of
the
house
the
house
without
was
of
timber
and
plaster
very
solidly
built
but
in
no
way
pretentious
and
the
plaster
was
stamped
in
panels
with
a
kind
of
in
half
circles
peculiar
my
cousin
told
me
to
that
part
of
the
country
within
it
was
very
pleasant
there
was
a
little
passage
as
we
came
in
and
to
right
and
left
lay
the
great
chamber
as
it
was
called
and
the
beyond
the
little
passage
was
the
staircase
panelled
all
the
way
up
with
the
instruments
of
the
passion
and
other
emblems
carved
on
a
row
of
the
panels
and
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
on
the
right
lay
a
little
parlour
very
pretty
with
hangings
presenting
the
knights
of
the
holy
grail
riding
upon
their
quest
upon
the
left
of
the
staircase
lay
a
paved
hall
with
a
little
pantry
under
the
stairs
to
the
left
and
the
kitchens
running
out
to
the
back
and
opposite
to
them
enclosing
a
little
grassed
court
the
brewhouse
and
the
bakehouse
behind
all
lay
the
kitchen
gardens
and
behind
the
brewhouse
a
row
of
old
yews
and
a
part
of
the
lawn
that
also
ran
before
the
house
the
house
was
of
three
stories
high
and
contained
about
twenty
rooms
with
the
attics
it
is
strange
how
some
houses
upon
a
first
acquaintance
with
them
seem
like
old
friends
and
how
others
though
one
may
have
lived
in
them
fifty
years
are
never
familiar
to
those
who
live
in
them
now
hare
street
house
was
one
of
the
first
kind
this
very
day
that
i
first
set
eyes
on
it
it
was
as
if
i
had
lived
there
as
a
child
the
sunlight
streamed
into
the
great
chamber
and
past
the
yews
into
the
parlour
and
upon
the
lawns
outside
and
the
noise
of
the
bees
in
the
limes
was
as
if
an
organ
played
softly
and
it
was
all
to
me
as
if
i
had
known
it
a
hundred
years
my
cousin
tom
carried
me
upstairs
presently
to
the
a
great
panelled
room
with
a
wide
above
the
that
i
might
wash
my
hands
and
face
before
dinner
and
my
heart
smote
me
a
little
for
all
my
thoughts
of
him
for
when
all
was
said
he
had
received
me
very
hospitably
and
was
now
bidding
me
welcome
again
and
that
i
must
live
there
as
long
as
i
would
and
think
of
it
as
my
home
and
here
he
said
opening
a
door
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
is
a
little
closet
where
your
man
can
hang
your
clothes
it
looks
out
upon
the
yard
and
my
room
is
beyond
it
over
the
kitchen
i
thanked
him
again
and
again
for
his
kindness
and
so
he
left
me
we
dined
below
presently
very
excellently
the
room
was
hung
with
green
with
panels
of
another
pattern
upon
it
and
the
dishes
were
put
in
through
a
little
hatch
from
the
kitchen
passage
my
man
james
waited
with
the
rest
and
acquitted
himself
very
well
then
after
dinner
when
the
servants
were
gone
away
my
cousin
tom
carried
me
out
with
a
mysterious
air
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
now
look
well
round
you
cousin
roger
he
said
when
he
had
me
standing
there
and
see
if
there
be
anything
that
would
draw
your
attention
i
looked
this
way
and
that
but
saw
nothing
and
said
so
have
you
ever
heard
of
master
owen
he
said
of
glorious
memory
why
yes
i
said
he
was
a
jesuit
martyred
under
elizabeth
and
he
made
did
he
not
well
he
hath
been
at
work
here
look
again
cousin
roger
i
turned
and
saw
my
cousin
dorothy
smiling
and
it
was
a
very
pretty
sight
too
but
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
seen
i
beat
with
my
foot
and
it
rang
a
little
hollow
no
no
those
are
the
cellars
said
my
cousin
tom
i
beat
then
upon
the
walls
here
and
there
but
to
no
purpose
and
then
upon
the
stairs
that
is
the
sloping
roof
of
the
pantry
only
said
my
cousin
tom
i
confessed
myself
outwitted
and
then
with
great
mirth
he
shewed
me
how
over
the
door
into
the
paved
hall
there
was
a
space
large
enough
to
hold
three
or
four
men
and
how
the
panels
opened
on
this
side
as
well
as
into
the
kitchen
passage
on
the
other
a
priest
or
suchlike
might
very
well
lie
here
a
week
or
two
might
he
not
asked
my
cousin
tom
delightedly
and
if
the
sentry
was
at
the
one
side
he
might
be
fed
from
the
other
it
is
cunningly
contrived
is
it
not
a
man
has
but
to
leap
up
here
from
a
chair
and
he
is
safe
i
praised
it
very
highly
to
please
him
and
indeed
it
was
very
curious
and
ingenious
but
those
days
are
done
i
said
who
can
tell
that
he
cried
though
a
week
ago
he
had
told
me
the
same
himself
some
priest
might
very
well
be
flying
for
his
life
along
this
road
and
turn
in
here
who
knows
whether
it
may
not
be
so
again
i
said
no
more
then
on
that
point
though
i
did
not
believe
him
and
there
is
one
more
matter
i
must
shew
you
in
your
own
chamber
if
you
have
any
private
papers
and
suchlike
then
he
shewed
me
in
my
own
room
by
the
head
of
the
bed
that
stood
along
the
wall
how
one
of
the
panels
slid
back
from
its
place
discovering
a
little
space
behind
where
a
man
might
very
well
keep
his
papers
or
his
money
not
a
living
soul
he
said
knows
of
that
besides
dolly
and
myself
you
are
at
liberty
to
use
that
cousin
roger
if
you
like
i
thanked
him
and
said
i
would
do
so
the
rest
of
that
day
i
spent
in
going
about
the
house
and
acquainting
myself
with
it
all
my
cousin
dorothy
shewed
me
the
rooms
her
own
was
a
little
one
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
she
told
me
smiling
that
a
ghost
was
said
to
walk
there
but
i
have
never
been
troubled
with
it
she
said
it
is
a
tall
old
woman
they
say
who
comes
up
the
stairs
and
into
the
room
but
she
does
no
harm
to
anyone
next
her
room
along
the
front
of
the
house
lay
two
other
greater
rooms
one
with
a
and
one
without
then
was
my
chamber
and
then
her
father
and
upstairs
were
the
attics
where
the
men
lay
the
maids
lay
in
two
little
rooms
above
the
kitchen
it
was
mighty
pleasant
to
me
to
be
with
my
cousin
dorothy
she
had
changed
her
riding
clothes
into
others
more
suitable
for
a
country
maid
with
a
white
starched
neckerchief
that
came
down
upon
her
shoulders
and
a
grey
dress
and
petticoat
below
that
her
sleeves
were
short
as
the
custom
is
in
the
country
with
great
linen
cuffs
folded
back
upon
them
so
as
to
leave
her
hands
and
arms
to
the
elbow
free
for
her
occupations
but
most
of
all
i
loved
her
simplicity
and
her
quietness
and
her
discretion
her
father
bade
her
expressly
to
shew
me
all
the
house
or
she
would
not
have
done
it
for
she
was
very
maidenly
and
modest
but
as
soon
as
he
said
that
she
did
it
without
affectation
she
shewed
me
the
parlour
too
with
the
hangings
upon
the
walls
and
the
chapel
of
the
grail
with
the
grail
itself
upon
an
altar
within
flanked
by
two
candlesticks
that
was
represented
over
the
she
came
out
with
me
too
to
shew
me
the
bakehouse
where
the
baking
was
already
begun
and
the
brewhouse
both
of
which
too
were
all
built
of
timber
and
plaster
and
there
my
cousin
tom
came
upon
us
and
carried
me
off
to
see
his
garden
and
his
pasture
for
he
farmed
a
few
acres
about
here
and
made
a
good
profit
out
of
it
and
it
was
while
i
walked
with
him
that
for
the
first
time
i
understood
what
his
intention
was
towards
me
he
was
speaking
as
he
very
often
did
of
his
daughter
dorothy
which
i
had
taken
to
be
a
father
affection
only
we
were
walking
at
the
time
up
and
down
in
the
pasture
below
the
garden
and
the
house
lay
visible
among
the
gardens
very
fair
and
peaceful
with
the
sunlight
upon
it
she
will
be
something
of
an
heiress
he
said
and
when
i
say
that
i
do
not
mean
that
she
will
have
as
many
acres
as
yourself
but
she
will
have
near
a
thousand
pound
a
year
so
soon
as
poor
tom
jermyn
dies
and
i
may
die
any
day
for
i
am
short
in
the
neck
and
might
very
well
be
taken
with
an
apoplexy
i
wish
above
all
things
then
to
see
her
safely
married
before
i
go
to
some
solid
man
who
will
care
for
her
there
is
a
plenty
of
protestants
about
here
that
would
have
her
for
she
is
a
wonderful
housewife
and
as
pure
as
diana
too
he
paused
at
that
and
looked
at
me
in
that
cunning
way
of
his
that
i
misliked
so
much
yet
even
now
i
did
not
see
what
he
would
be
at
for
gentlemen
do
not
usually
fling
their
daughters
at
the
head
of
any
man
and
he
knew
nothing
of
me
but
that
i
was
pretty
rich
and
would
be
more
so
one
day
but
i
suppose
that
that
was
enough
for
him
i
had
thought
at
one
time
he
went
on
of
sending
her
to
court
i
could
get
her
in
under
the
protection
of
my
lady
arlington
but
the
court
is
no
place
for
a
maiden
who
knows
nothing
of
the
world
what
would
you
advise
cousin
roger
i
would
not
have
her
marry
a
protestant
if
i
could
help
it
and
with
that
he
looked
at
me
again
then
all
of
a
sudden
i
saw
his
meaning
and
my
heart
stood
still
for
not
only
did
his
words
reveal
him
to
me
but
myself
also
and
i
understood
why
he
had
questioned
me
so
closely
in
town
as
to
my
fortune
i
can
not
say
at
this
time
that
i
loved
my
cousin
dolly
for
i
had
not
known
that
i
loved
her
but
his
words
were
very
effective
indeed
i
had
not
thought
to
marry
though
i
was
free
to
do
so
for
a
novice
does
not
quickly
shake
off
his
monkishness
i
had
thought
far
more
of
the
mission
i
was
come
to
england
upon
and
what
i
could
accomplish
with
god
blessing
for
christ
and
his
church
but
as
i
say
my
heart
stood
still
when
my
cousin
said
that
to
me
for
as
in
a
vision
i
saw
myself
here
as
her
husband
and
her
as
my
wife
in
this
house
among
its
gardens
here
we
might
live
a
life
which
even
the
angels
might
envy
harmless
innocent
separate
from
sinners
as
the
apostle
says
not
accomplishing
maybe
any
great
things
but
at
least
refraining
from
the
hindering
of
god
kingdom
the
summers
would
come
and
go
and
we
still
be
here
with
our
children
growing
about
us
to
inherit
the
place
and
the
name
such
as
it
was
and
no
harm
done
no
vows
broken
no
offence
to
any
such
thoughts
as
these
did
not
as
yet
shew
any
very
great
ardour
of
love
in
me
and
indeed
i
had
not
got
this
yet
but
she
was
the
first
maid
i
had
ever
had
any
acquaintance
with
at
least
for
some
while
and
this
no
doubt
had
its
effect
upon
me
all
this
came
upon
me
of
a
sudden
and
as
i
lifted
my
eyes
i
saw
my
cousin
dolly
sunbonnet
going
among
the
herbs
of
the
garden
and
saw
her
in
my
mind
eye
too
as
i
had
seen
her
just
now
cool
and
innocent
and
good
with
that
touch
of
hidden
fire
in
her
eyes
that
draws
a
man
heart
neither
had
she
looked
unkindly
on
me
our
intimacy
had
made
wonderful
progress
though
i
had
known
her
scarcely
more
than
a
week
she
had
spoken
to
me
of
her
father
too
as
one
would
speak
only
to
a
friend
yet
i
could
not
say
one
word
of
this
to
him
for
he
had
not
said
anything
explicit
to
me
and
i
knew
too
that
i
must
give
myself
time
for
a
man
does
not
if
he
is
wise
change
the
course
of
his
life
on
an
instant
thought
yet
i
must
not
say
no
outright
and
thereby
maybe
bang
the
door
on
my
new
hopes
i
could
not
advise
you
at
present
i
said
i
do
not
know
my
cousin
well
enough
to
advise
anything
i
am
one
with
you
so
far
as
concerns
the
court
i
can
not
think
that
any
catholic
father
should
send
his
daughter
into
such
a
den
of
lions
and
worse
and
i
am
one
with
you
as
concerns
marrying
her
to
a
protestant
yet
i
can
say
no
more
at
present
and
at
that
my
cousin
tom
looked
at
me
in
such
a
manner
as
near
to
ruin
his
own
scheme
for
his
eyes
said
if
his
mouth
did
not
that
now
we
understood
one
another
and
were
upon
the
same
side
or
at
least
not
opposed
and
to
think
that
i
was
leagued
with
him
against
her
made
my
heart
hot
with
anger
very
well
he
said
we
will
say
no
more
at
present
and
he
bade
me
observe
an
old
ram
that
was
regarding
us
with
a
face
not
unlike
cousin
tom
own
but
i
suppose
that
he
did
not
know
this
in
this
manner
then
began
our
life
at
hare
street
for
i
was
there
six
weeks
before
i
went
back
again
to
london
in
the
way
i
shall
relate
presently
the
days
were
passed
for
the
most
time
from
rising
until
dinner
upon
the
farm
or
in
hunting
for
we
rode
out
now
and
again
with
the
neighbours
after
a
stag
who
had
come
from
the
woods
but
we
did
not
because
of
the
papistry
of
the
house
see
a
great
deal
of
the
neighbours
or
they
of
us
the
parson
of
hormead
came
to
see
us
now
and
again
and
behaved
very
civilly
but
during
those
six
weeks
we
had
no
sight
of
a
priest
except
once
when
we
rode
to
standon
to
hear
mass
after
dinner
i
gave
myself
up
to
writing
for
i
thought
that
i
could
best
serve
his
holiness
in
this
way
making
my
diary
each
day
in
shorthand
as
i
had
learned
from
an
italian
and
it
is
from
that
very
diary
that
this
narrative
is
composed
and
i
wrote
too
a
report
or
two
apologizing
for
the
poverty
of
it
which
i
determined
to
send
to
the
cardinal
secretary
as
soon
as
i
had
an
opportunity
i
read
too
a
little
italian
or
spanish
or
french
every
day
and
thus
for
the
most
part
kept
to
my
chamber
but
all
my
papers
i
put
away
each
afternoon
in
the
little
in
my
chamber
and
made
excuse
for
keeping
my
room
on
the
score
of
my
practice
in
languages
we
supped
at
five
which
was
the
country
hour
and
after
that
to
me
came
the
best
part
of
the
day
for
my
cousin
dorothy
i
had
learned
was
an
extraordinary
fine
musician
we
had
of
course
no
music
such
as
was
possible
in
town
but
she
had
taught
a
maid
to
play
upon
a
fiddle
and
herself
played
upon
the
and
the
two
together
would
play
in
the
great
chamber
after
supper
for
an
hour
or
two
when
the
dishes
were
washed
in
this
manner
we
had
many
a
corrant
and
saraband
and
i
was
able
to
prick
down
for
them
too
some
italian
music
i
remembered
which
she
set
for
the
two
instruments
sometimes
too
when
cousin
tom
was
not
too
drowsy
after
his
day
and
his
ale
the
three
would
sing
and
i
would
listen
for
my
cousin
tom
sang
a
plump
bass
very
well
when
he
was
in
the
mood
for
it
as
for
me
i
had
but
a
monk
voice
that
is
very
well
when
all
the
choir
is
together
but
not
of
much
use
under
other
circumstances
in
this
way
then
i
made
acquaintance
with
a
number
of
songs
such
as
mr
wise
it
is
not
that
i
love
you
less
and
his
duet
go
perjured
man
of
which
the
words
are
taken
from
herrick
hesperides
and
of
which
the
music
was
made
by
mr
wise
who
was
a
gentleman
of
the
chapel
royal
at
his
majesty
express
wish
i
have
many
very
pleasant
memories
of
hare
street
but
i
think
none
more
pleasant
than
of
the
music
in
the
great
chamber
i
would
sit
near
the
window
and
see
them
in
the
evening
light
with
their
faces
turned
to
me
or
when
it
grew
late
with
the
candlelight
upon
them
and
their
dresses
or
sometimes
when
the
evening
was
fair
and
warm
i
would
sit
out
upon
the
lawn
and
they
at
the
window
and
listen
to
the
singing
coming
out
of
the
candlelight
and
see
them
move
against
it
my
cousin
dorothy
would
make
herself
fine
in
the
evening
not
i
mean
like
a
court
lady
for
these
dresses
of
hers
were
put
away
in
lavender
but
with
a
lace
neckerchief
on
her
throat
and
shoulders
and
lace
ruffles
at
her
wrists
yet
all
this
while
i
made
no
progress
with
her
or
even
with
myself
for
every
time
that
i
was
alone
with
her
or
when
her
father
was
asleep
in
his
chair
a
remembrance
of
what
he
had
said
came
over
me
with
a
kind
of
sickness
and
i
could
not
say
one
word
that
might
seem
to
set
me
on
his
side
against
her
and
so
i
was
torn
two
ways
and
the
very
thing
by
which
he
had
hoped
to
encourage
me
or
rather
to
help
himself
had
the
contrary
effect
and
silenced
me
when
i
might
have
spoken
for
i
understood
very
well
by
now
what
was
in
his
mind
he
saw
no
prospect
of
marrying
dolly
to
a
protestant
or
i
take
it
if
i
know
the
man
he
would
have
leapt
at
it
neither
was
there
any
hope
of
marrying
her
to
a
catholic
and
as
for
his
talk
about
my
lady
arlington
i
did
not
believe
one
word
of
it
therefore
since
i
was
at
hand
and
would
be
a
wealthy
man
some
day
and
indeed
even
now
did
very
well
on
my
french
he
had
set
his
heart
on
this
it
was
not
wholly
evil
yet
the
of
it
affected
me
like
a
stink
the
matter
ended
for
the
time
on
the
evening
of
the
thirteenth
of
august
in
the
following
manner
when
my
adventures
of
which
my
life
ever
since
my
audience
with
our
most
holy
lord
the
pope
had
been
but
a
prelude
properly
began
those
adventures
for
whose
sake
i
have
begun
this
transcript
from
my
diary
and
this
adventure
was
as
i
think
now
by
one
or
two
curious
happenings
on
the
morning
of
the
thirteenth
of
august
two
days
before
the
feast
of
the
assumption
on
which
we
had
intended
to
hear
mass
again
at
standon
my
cousin
dorothy
came
down
a
little
late
and
found
us
already
over
our
oatbread
and
small
beer
which
we
were
accustomed
to
take
upon
rising
and
which
was
called
our
morning
i
slept
very
ill
she
said
and
no
more
then
afterwards
however
as
i
was
lighting
my
pipe
in
the
little
court
at
the
back
of
the
house
she
came
out
and
beckoned
me
in
and
i
saw
that
something
was
amiss
i
went
after
her
into
the
little
hung
parlour
and
we
sat
down
i
slept
very
ill
cousin
she
said
again
and
i
observed
again
that
her
eyes
looked
hollow
and
i
dare
not
tell
my
father
my
fancies
she
said
for
he
is
terrified
at
such
things
and
has
forbade
the
servants
to
speak
of
such
things
the
tall
old
woman
then
i
said
for
i
had
not
forgotten
what
she
had
told
me
before
yes
she
said
smiling
a
little
painfully
and
yet
i
was
not
at
all
afraid
when
she
came
or
when
i
thought
that
she
did
tell
me
the
whole
tale
i
said
i
awakened
about
one
this
morning
she
said
and
knew
that
my
sleep
was
gone
from
me
altogether
yet
i
did
not
feel
afraid
or
restless
but
lay
there
content
enough
expecting
something
but
what
it
would
be
i
did
not
know
the
cocks
were
crowing
as
i
awakened
and
then
were
silent
and
it
appeared
to
me
as
if
all
the
world
were
listening
after
a
while
i
should
say
it
was
ten
minutes
or
thereabouts
i
turned
over
with
my
face
to
the
wall
and
as
i
did
so
i
heard
a
soft
step
coming
up
the
stairs
one
of
the
maids
thought
i
late
abed
or
early
rising
for
sickness
when
the
steps
came
to
my
door
they
ceased
and
a
hand
was
laid
upon
the
latch
and
at
that
i
made
to
move
but
could
not
yet
it
was
not
fear
that
held
me
there
though
it
was
like
a
gentle
pricking
all
over
me
then
the
latch
was
lifted
and
still
i
could
not
move
not
even
my
eyes
and
a
person
came
in
and
across
the
floor
to
my
bed
and
even
then
i
could
not
move
nor
cry
out
presently
the
person
spoke
but
i
do
not
know
what
she
said
though
it
was
only
a
word
or
two
but
the
voice
came
from
high
up
as
almost
from
the
canopy
of
the
bed
and
it
was
the
voice
of
an
old
woman
speaking
in
a
kind
of
whisper
i
said
nothing
for
i
could
not
and
then
again
the
steps
moved
across
the
floor
and
out
of
the
door
and
i
heard
the
latch
shut
again
and
then
they
passed
away
down
the
stairs
my
cousin
dorothy
was
pale
as
death
by
this
time
and
her
blue
eyes
were
set
wide
open
i
made
to
take
her
by
the
hand
but
i
did
not
you
were
dreaming
i
said
it
was
the
memory
of
the
tale
you
have
heard
she
shook
her
head
but
she
said
nothing
you
have
never
had
it
before
i
asked
never
she
said
you
must
lie
in
another
chamber
for
a
week
or
two
and
forget
it
i
can
not
do
that
she
said
my
father
would
know
of
it
and
she
spoke
so
courageously
that
i
was
reassured
well
you
must
cry
out
if
it
comes
again
you
can
have
your
maid
to
sleep
with
you
i
might
do
that
she
said
and
then
cousin
roger
doth
god
permit
these
things
to
provide
us
against
some
danger
it
may
be
so
i
said
to
quiet
her
but
be
sure
that
no
harm
can
come
of
it
at
that
we
heard
her
father
calling
her
and
she
stood
up
i
have
told
you
as
a
secret
cousin
roger
there
must
be
no
word
to
my
father
i
pledged
myself
to
that
for
i
could
see
what
a
spirit
she
had
and
we
said
no
more
about
it
then
as
the
day
passed
on
the
sky
grew
heavy
or
rather
the
air
for
the
sky
was
still
blue
overhead
only
on
the
horizon
to
the
south
the
clouds
that
are
called
began
to
gather
the
air
was
so
hot
too
that
i
could
scarcely
bear
to
work
for
i
had
set
myself
to
take
some
in
a
little
that
was
in
the
garden
against
the
south
wall
and
by
noon
the
sky
was
overcast
after
dinner
i
went
up
to
my
chamber
and
a
great
heaviness
fell
upon
me
till
i
looked
out
of
the
window
and
saw
that
beyond
the
limes
the
clouds
spewed
a
reddish
tint
that
marked
the
approach
of
thunder
and
at
that
grew
reassured
again
and
not
only
for
myself
but
for
my
cousin
dorothy
whose
tale
had
lain
close
on
my
heart
through
the
morning
for
this
thought
i
is
the
explanation
of
it
all
the
maid
was
oppressed
by
the
heat
and
the
approaching
storm
and
fancied
all
the
rest
i
fell
asleep
in
my
chair
over
my
italian
and
when
i
awakened
it
was
near
and
the
heaviness
was
upon
me
again
like
lead
and
my
diary
not
written
after
supper
and
some
talk
i
made
excuse
to
do
my
writing
and
as
it
was
growing
dark
and
i
was
finishing
i
heard
music
from
the
great
chamber
beneath
they
were
singing
together
a
song
i
had
not
heard
before
and
i
listened
well
pleased
promising
myself
the
pleasure
too
of
going
downstairs
presently
and
hearing
it
between
two
of
the
verses
i
heard
on
a
sudden
over
the
beyond
the
village
the
beat
of
a
horse
hoofs
galloping
but
i
thought
no
more
of
it
at
the
end
of
the
next
verse
even
before
it
was
finished
i
heard
the
hoofs
again
through
the
music
i
ran
to
the
window
to
see
who
rode
so
fast
and
was
barely
in
time
to
see
a
courier
in
a
blue
coat
dash
past
the
new
iron
gate
pulling
at
his
horse
as
he
did
so
an
instant
later
i
heard
the
horse
turn
in
at
the
yard
gate
and
immediately
the
singing
ceased
as
i
came
down
the
stairs
i
saw
my
cousin
dolly
run
out
into
the
inner
lobby
and
her
face
in
the
dusk
was
as
white
as
paper
and
the
same
instant
there
came
a
hammering
at
the
hall
door
what
is
it
what
is
it
cried
she
and
clung
to
me
as
i
came
down
i
saw
through
the
inner
door
my
cousin
tom
unbolting
the
outer
one
he
had
taken
down
a
pistol
that
hung
upon
the
wall
for
the
highwaymen
waxed
very
bold
sometimes
then
when
he
opened
the
door
i
heard
my
name
i
went
forward
and
received
from
the
courier
a
sealed
letter
and
there
in
the
twilight
i
opened
and
read
it
it
was
from
chiffinch
bidding
me
come
to
town
at
once
on
king
business
i
must
ride
to
town
i
said
cousin
tom
will
you
order
my
horse
for
me
and
another
for
this
man
i
do
not
know
when
i
shall
be
back
again
and
as
i
said
these
words
i
saw
my
cousin
dorothy
face
looking
at
me
from
the
dusk
of
the
inner
hall
and
knew
what
was
in
her
mind
and
that
it
was
the
matter
of
the
tall
old
woman
in
her
room
chapter
v
the
storm
was
broken
before
we
could
set
out
and
the
ride
so
far
as
hoddesdon
was
such
as
i
shall
never
forget
for
the
wind
was
violent
against
us
and
it
was
pitchy
dark
before
we
came
even
to
puckeridge
the
thunder
was
as
if
great
guns
were
shot
off
or
bags
of
marbles
dashed
on
an
oak
floor
overhead
and
the
countryside
was
as
light
as
day
under
the
flashes
so
that
we
could
see
the
trees
and
their
shadows
and
i
think
sometimes
the
green
colour
of
them
too
we
wore
all
three
of
us
the
courier
i
and
my
man
james
cloaks
but
these
were
saturated
within
half
an
hour
we
had
no
fear
of
highwaymen
even
had
we
not
been
armed
for
the
artillery
of
heaven
had
long
ago
driven
all
other
within
doors
the
hardest
part
of
the
journey
was
that
i
knew
no
more
than
the
dead
indeed
not
so
much
why
it
was
that
chiffinch
had
sent
for
me
he
had
said
nothing
in
his
letter
save
that
his
majesty
wished
my
presence
at
once
and
on
the
outside
of
the
letter
was
written
the
word
haste
three
times
over
i
thought
of
a
hundred
matters
that
it
might
be
but
none
of
them
satisfied
me
it
is
near
forty
miles
from
hare
street
to
whitehall
but
so
bad
was
the
way
that
though
we
changed
horses
at
waltham
cross
at
the
we
did
not
come
to
london
until
eight
in
the
morning
and
it
was
eight
before
we
rode
up
to
whitehall
the
last
part
of
the
journey
was
pretty
pleasant
for
the
rain
held
off
and
it
was
strange
to
see
the
white
hard
light
of
the
clouded
dawn
upon
the
fields
and
the
trees
but
by
the
time
we
came
to
london
it
was
long
ago
broad
day
by
three
or
four
hours
at
the
least
and
all
the
folks
were
abroad
in
the
streets
i
went
straight
to
chiffinch
lodgings
sending
my
man
to
the
lodging
in
covent
garden
to
bestow
the
horses
and
to
come
again
to
the
to
await
my
orders
chiffinch
was
not
within
for
he
had
not
expected
me
so
early
a
servant
told
me
but
he
had
looked
for
my
coming
about
eleven
or
twelve
and
had
given
orders
that
i
was
to
be
taken
to
a
closet
to
change
my
clothes
if
i
needed
it
this
i
did
and
then
was
set
down
to
break
my
fast
and
while
i
was
at
it
chiffinch
himself
came
in
he
told
me
that
i
had
done
very
well
to
come
so
swiftly
but
he
smiled
a
little
as
he
said
it
his
majesty
is
closeted
with
one
or
two
more
until
ten
i
will
send
to
let
him
know
you
are
come
i
did
not
ask
him
for
what
business
i
had
been
sent
for
since
he
did
not
choose
to
tell
me
himself
and
he
went
out
again
but
he
was
presently
back
once
more
and
told
me
that
his
majesty
would
see
me
at
once
my
mind
was
all
perturbed
as
i
went
with
him
in
the
rain
across
the
passages
i
felt
as
if
some
great
evil
threatened
but
i
could
make
no
conjecture
as
to
what
it
was
about
or
how
it
could
be
anything
that
was
at
once
so
sudden
and
that
demanded
my
presence
we
went
straight
up
the
stairs
and
across
the
same
and
chiffinch
flung
open
the
door
of
the
same
little
closet
where
i
had
spoken
with
the
king
speaking
my
name
as
he
did
so
his
majesty
was
sitting
in
the
very
same
place
where
he
sat
before
with
his
chair
wheeled
about
so
that
he
faced
three
men
one
of
them
i
knew
at
once
for
my
cousin
had
pointed
him
out
to
me
in
the
park
my
lord
danby
who
was
lord
treasurer
at
this
time
and
he
was
sitting
at
the
end
of
the
great
table
nearest
to
the
king
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
nearer
to
me
as
i
entered
were
two
men
upon
whom
i
had
never
set
eyes
before
one
of
them
a
little
man
in
the
dress
of
an
apothecary
or
attorney
and
the
other
a
minister
in
his
cassock
and
bands
all
four
turned
their
eyes
upon
me
as
i
came
in
and
then
the
two
who
were
standing
turned
them
back
again
towards
his
majesty
there
was
a
heap
of
papers
on
the
table
below
my
lord
danby
hand
his
majesty
made
a
little
inclination
of
his
head
to
me
but
said
nothing
putting
out
his
hand
and
when
i
had
kissed
it
and
stood
back
with
the
other
two
he
continued
speaking
as
if
i
were
not
there
his
face
had
a
look
as
if
he
were
a
little
and
yet
a
little
merry
too
continue
my
lord
he
said
now
doctor
said
my
lord
in
a
patient
kind
of
voice
as
if
he
encouraged
the
other
you
tell
us
that
all
these
papers
were
thrust
under
your
door
by
whom
were
they
thrust
do
you
think
my
lord
i
have
my
suspicions
said
the
minister
but
i
do
not
know
can
you
verify
these
suspicions
of
yours
do
you
think
my
lord
i
can
try
and
under
how
many
heads
are
they
ranged
asked
the
king
drawling
a
little
in
his
speech
sir
they
are
under
heads
the
king
rolled
his
eyes
as
if
in
a
droll
kind
of
despair
but
he
said
nothing
and
you
tell
me
began
my
lord
but
his
majesty
broke
in
he
said
and
here
is
good
mallock
come
here
and
knows
not
a
word
of
the
proceedings
mallock
these
good
gentlemen
doctor
tonge
a
very
worthy
divine
and
a
physician
of
the
soul
and
kirby
a
very
worthy
chymist
and
a
physician
of
the
body
are
come
to
tell
me
of
a
plot
against
my
life
on
the
part
of
some
of
my
faithful
lieges
whereby
they
would
thrust
me
swiftly
down
to
hell
body
and
soul
together
so
that
i
take
it
is
why
god
almighty
hath
raised
up
these
physicians
to
save
me
i
wish
you
to
hear
their
evidence
that
is
why
i
sent
for
you
continue
my
lord
my
lord
looked
a
little
displeased
pursing
up
his
mouth
at
the
manner
in
which
the
king
told
the
tale
but
he
said
nothing
on
that
point
grove
and
pickering
then
it
appears
were
to
shoot
his
majesty
and
wakeman
to
poison
him
they
will
take
no
risks
you
see
mallock
put
in
the
king
yes
my
lord
said
tonge
they
were
to
have
screwed
pistols
with
silver
bullets
champed
that
the
wounds
may
not
heal
prudent
prudent
cried
the
king
then
my
lord
danby
lost
his
patience
and
pushed
the
papers
together
with
a
sweep
of
his
arm
sir
he
said
i
think
we
may
let
these
worthy
gentlemen
go
for
the
present
until
the
papers
are
examined
with
all
my
heart
said
the
king
but
not
mallock
i
wish
to
speak
privately
with
mr
mallock
so
the
two
were
dismissed
but
i
noticed
that
the
king
did
not
give
them
his
hand
to
kiss
they
appeared
to
me
a
pair
of
silly
folks
rather
than
wicked
as
others
thought
them
afterwards
who
themselves
partly
believed
at
any
rate
the
foolish
tale
that
they
told
kirby
was
a
little
man
as
i
have
said
with
a
kind
of
air
and
doctor
tonge
had
no
great
distinction
of
any
kind
except
his
look
of
foolishness
when
they
were
gone
my
lord
danby
turned
to
the
king
with
a
kind
of
indignation
your
majesty
may
be
pleased
to
make
a
mock
of
it
all
but
your
loving
subjects
can
not
i
have
permission
then
to
examine
these
papers
and
report
to
your
majesty
why
yes
said
the
king
so
you
do
not
inflict
the
heads
upon
me
i
have
one
of
my
own
which
i
must
care
for
my
lord
said
no
more
he
gathered
his
papers
without
a
word
saluted
the
king
at
a
distance
still
without
speaking
and
went
out
giving
me
a
sharp
glance
as
he
went
now
mallock
said
his
majesty
sit
you
down
and
listen
to
me
i
sat
down
but
i
was
all
bewildered
as
to
why
i
had
been
sent
for
what
had
i
to
do
with
such
affairs
as
these
do
you
know
of
a
man
called
grove
the
king
asked
me
suddenly
now
the
name
had
meant
nothing
to
me
when
i
had
heard
it
just
now
but
when
it
was
put
to
me
in
this
way
i
remembered
i
was
about
to
speak
when
he
spoke
again
or
pickering
he
said
sir
a
man
called
grove
is
known
to
me
but
no
pickering
ha
then
there
is
a
man
called
grove
if
it
be
the
same
he
is
a
papist
sir
he
is
a
of
the
society
of
jesus
and
dwells
the
king
held
up
his
hand
i
wish
to
know
nothing
more
than
i
am
obliged
pickering
is
some
sort
of
religious
too
they
tell
me
and
what
kind
of
a
man
is
grove
he
is
a
modest
kind
of
man
sir
he
opened
the
door
to
me
and
i
saw
him
of
the
table
for
dinner
i
know
no
more
of
him
than
that
then
the
king
drew
himself
up
in
his
chair
suddenly
as
i
had
seen
him
do
before
and
his
mocking
manner
left
him
it
was
as
if
another
man
sat
there
mallock
he
said
shaking
his
finger
at
me
with
great
solemnity
listen
to
me
i
had
thought
for
a
long
time
that
an
attempt
would
be
made
against
the
catholics
there
is
a
great
deal
of
feeling
in
the
country
now
that
my
brother
is
one
of
them
and
i
myself
am
known
not
to
be
disinclined
towards
them
and
i
make
no
doubt
at
all
that
this
is
such
an
attempt
they
have
begun
with
the
jesuits
for
that
will
be
the
most
popular
cry
and
they
have
added
in
sir
george
wakeman
name
her
majesty
physician
to
give
colour
to
it
all
by
and
by
they
will
add
other
names
you
will
see
if
it
be
not
so
until
not
a
jesuit
and
scarce
a
catholic
is
left
who
is
not
embroiled
in
it
i
do
not
know
who
is
behind
this
matter
it
may
be
my
lord
danby
himself
or
shaftesbury
or
a
score
of
others
or
it
may
be
some
discontented
fellow
who
will
make
his
fortune
over
it
for
all
know
that
such
a
cry
as
this
will
be
a
popular
one
but
this
i
know
for
a
verity
that
there
is
not
one
word
of
truth
in
the
tale
from
beginning
to
end
and
it
will
appear
so
presently
no
doubt
yet
meanwhile
a
great
deal
of
mischief
may
be
done
and
my
brother
may
be
and
even
her
majesty
may
suffer
for
it
if
we
are
not
very
prudent
now
mallock
i
sent
for
you
for
i
did
not
know
who
else
to
send
for
you
are
not
known
in
england
or
scarcely
you
come
commended
to
me
by
the
holy
father
himself
you
are
neither
priest
nor
jesuit
what
then
you
must
do
for
me
is
this
first
you
must
speak
not
one
word
of
the
matter
to
any
living
soul
not
even
your
confessor
for
if
we
can
quash
the
whole
matter
privately
so
much
the
better
i
had
you
in
just
now
that
danby
and
the
others
might
see
that
you
had
my
confidence
but
i
said
nothing
of
who
you
were
nor
where
you
came
from
and
if
they
inquire
they
will
know
nothing
but
that
you
come
commended
by
the
ambassadors
very
well
then
you
must
go
about
freely
amongst
the
jesuits
and
rake
together
any
evidence
that
you
can
that
may
be
of
use
to
them
if
the
affair
should
ever
be
made
public
and
yet
they
must
know
nothing
of
the
reason
i
lay
that
upon
you
and
you
must
mix
freely
in
taverns
and
especially
among
the
smaller
gentry
and
hear
what
you
can
as
to
whether
the
plot
hath
yet
leaked
out
for
it
is
no
less
and
what
they
think
of
it
and
if
not
what
it
is
that
they
say
of
the
catholics
you
understand
me
mr
mallock
i
said
yes
but
my
heart
had
grown
sick
during
the
king
speech
to
me
for
all
that
i
had
ever
thought
in
rome
of
england
seemed
on
the
point
of
fulfilment
his
majesty
too
had
spoken
with
an
extraordinary
vehemence
that
was
like
a
fire
for
heat
but
i
must
have
commanded
my
countenance
well
for
he
commended
me
on
my
behaviour
your
manner
is
excellent
mallock
he
said
both
just
now
and
a
few
minutes
ago
you
take
it
very
well
and
i
have
your
word
upon
it
that
you
will
observe
secrecy
my
word
on
it
sir
i
said
then
his
majesty
leaned
back
again
and
relaxed
a
little
that
is
very
well
he
said
and
i
think
i
have
chosen
my
man
well
you
need
not
fear
mallock
that
any
harm
will
come
to
the
good
fathers
or
to
grove
or
pickering
either
they
can
not
lay
a
finger
upon
them
without
my
consent
and
that
they
shall
never
have
it
is
to
prevent
rather
the
scandal
of
the
whole
matter
that
i
am
anxious
and
to
save
the
queen
and
my
brother
from
any
trouble
you
do
not
know
yet
i
think
all
the
feeling
that
there
is
upon
the
catholics
i
said
nothing
it
was
my
business
to
listen
rather
and
indeed
what
his
majesty
said
next
was
worth
hearing
there
be
three
kinds
of
religion
in
my
realm
he
said
the
presbyterian
and
independent
and
that
kind
for
i
count
those
all
one
and
that
is
no
religion
for
a
gentleman
and
there
is
the
church
of
england
of
which
i
am
the
head
which
numbers
many
gentlemen
but
is
no
religion
for
a
christian
and
there
is
the
catholic
which
is
the
only
religion
so
far
as
i
am
acquainted
with
any
suited
for
both
gentlemen
and
christians
that
is
my
view
of
the
matter
mr
mallock
the
merry
look
was
back
in
his
eyes
melancholy
though
they
always
were
as
he
said
this
for
myself
it
was
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
ask
his
majesty
why
if
he
thought
so
he
did
not
act
upon
it
but
i
did
not
thinking
it
too
bold
on
so
short
an
acquaintance
and
i
think
i
was
right
in
that
for
he
put
it
immediately
into
words
himself
i
know
what
you
are
thinking
mallock
well
i
am
not
yet
a
good
enough
christian
for
that
i
knew
very
well
what
his
majesty
meant
when
he
said
that
he
was
thinking
of
his
women
to
whom
as
yet
he
could
not
say
and
the
compassion
surged
up
in
me
again
at
the
thought
that
a
man
so
noble
as
this
and
who
knew
so
much
as
his
speeches
had
shewed
me
could
be
so
ignoble
too
so
tied
and
bound
by
his
sins
and
it
affected
me
so
much
here
in
his
presence
that
had
so
strange
a
fascination
in
it
that
it
was
as
if
a
hand
had
squeezed
my
throat
so
that
i
could
not
speak
even
if
i
would
well
sir
he
said
i
must
thank
you
for
coming
so
quickly
when
i
sent
for
you
chiffinch
knows
why
you
are
come
but
no
one
else
and
even
to
him
you
must
not
say
one
word
you
will
do
well
and
discreetly
of
that
i
am
sure
i
will
send
for
you
again
presently
and
you
may
come
to
me
when
you
will
he
gave
me
his
hand
to
kiss
and
i
went
out
promising
that
no
pains
should
be
spared
it
was
indeed
a
difficult
task
that
his
majesty
had
laid
upon
me
i
was
to
speak
freely
to
the
priests
yet
not
freely
and
how
to
collect
the
evidence
that
was
required
i
knew
not
since
i
knew
nothing
at
all
of
when
the
conspiring
was
said
to
be
done
nor
what
would
be
of
avail
to
protect
them
and
all
the
way
to
my
lodgings
with
my
man
james
i
was
thinking
of
what
was
best
to
do
my
man
had
ordered
that
all
things
should
be
ready
for
my
entertainment
and
i
found
the
rooms
prepared
and
the
beds
laid
and
the
first
thing
i
did
after
dinner
was
to
go
to
bed
after
i
had
written
to
my
cousin
tom
at
hare
street
and
sleep
until
the
evening
when
i
was
dressed
and
had
had
supper
in
the
listening
as
well
as
i
could
to
the
talk
but
hearing
nothing
pertinent
i
went
back
again
to
drury
lane
to
fenwick
lodging
to
lay
the
foundation
of
my
plan
for
i
had
determined
between
sleeping
and
waking
that
the
best
thing
to
be
done
was
to
shew
myself
as
forward
and
friendly
as
i
could
so
that
i
might
mix
with
the
fathers
freely
in
the
hope
that
i
might
light
on
something
and
it
so
fell
out
that
although
my
small
adventures
that
evening
had
no
use
in
them
in
the
event
yet
they
were
strangely
relevant
to
what
took
place
afterwards
the
first
small
adventure
was
as
follows
i
was
walking
swiftly
up
drury
lane
scanning
the
houses
for
it
was
falling
dark
and
the
that
burned
one
before
every
tenth
house
cast
but
a
poor
illumination
when
just
beyond
one
of
the
lights
i
knocked
against
a
fellow
who
was
coming
out
suddenly
from
a
little
passage
at
the
side
just
as
it
chanced
opposite
to
house
i
turned
to
beg
his
pardon
for
it
was
more
my
fault
than
his
that
we
had
come
together
and
i
set
my
eyes
upon
the
most
strange
and
villainous
face
that
i
have
ever
seen
the
fellow
was
dressed
in
a
dark
suit
and
wore
a
crowned
hat
and
carried
a
club
in
his
hand
and
he
appeared
to
be
one
of
the
as
they
are
called
who
are
at
the
bottom
of
all
riots
and
such
like
things
he
was
a
smallish
man
in
his
height
but
his
face
was
the
strangest
thing
about
him
and
in
the
light
from
the
lamp
i
thought
at
first
that
he
had
some
kind
of
deformity
in
it
for
his
mouth
was
as
it
were
in
the
very
midst
of
his
face
there
was
a
little
forehead
above
with
eyes
set
close
beneath
it
and
a
little
nose
and
then
his
mouth
turned
up
at
the
corners
as
if
he
smiled
and
beneath
that
a
vast
chin
as
large
as
the
rest
of
his
face
he
cried
out
lard
as
i
ran
against
him
by
which
i
understood
him
to
say
lord
i
asked
his
pardon
o
lard
he
said
again
is
nothing
sir
my
apologies
to
you
sir
i
bowed
to
him
civilly
again
and
passed
on
but
as
i
knocked
upon
fenwick
door
i
saw
that
he
was
staring
after
me
from
the
entrance
to
that
same
passage
from
which
he
had
come
my
second
adventure
was
that
upon
coming
upstairs
i
found
that
in
the
chamber
with
fenwick
were
the
mother
and
sister
of
ireland
waiting
for
him
to
come
and
take
them
back
to
their
lodging
they
were
quiet
folks
enough
a
little
shy
it
appeared
to
me
of
strange
company
but
i
did
my
best
to
be
civil
and
they
grew
more
talkative
ireland
would
be
near
sixty
years
old
i
would
take
it
dressed
in
a
brown
sac
such
as
had
been
fashionable
ten
years
back
and
her
daughter
i
should
think
about
thirty
years
old
they
told
me
that
they
had
been
to
supper
and
to
the
play
in
the
duke
playhouse
where
shirley
young
had
been
done
and
that
ireland
was
to
come
for
them
here
as
presently
he
did
for
it
was
scarce
safe
for
ladies
to
be
abroad
at
such
an
hour
in
the
streets
without
an
escort
so
wild
were
the
pranks
played
and
worse
than
pranks
by
even
the
king
gentlemen
themselves
as
well
as
by
the
we
sat
and
talked
a
good
while
and
grove
brought
chocolate
up
for
the
ladies
but
for
myself
i
had
such
a
variety
of
thoughts
as
i
talked
with
them
all
knowing
what
i
did
and
they
knowing
nothing
that
i
could
scarce
command
my
voice
and
manner
sometimes
for
here
were
these
innocent
folk
with
grove
smiling
upon
them
with
the
chocolate
talking
of
the
play
and
and
of
which
of
the
actors
pleased
them
and
which
did
not
and
i
noticed
that
the
ladies
as
always
were
very
severe
upon
the
women
and
the
good
fathers
too
pleased
that
they
were
pleased
and
rallying
them
upon
their
gaiety
for
it
appeared
that
these
ladies
did
not
go
often
into
company
and
here
sat
i
with
my
secret
upon
my
heart
knowing
or
guessing
at
least
that
a
plot
was
afoot
to
ruin
them
all
and
turn
their
merriment
into
mourning
but
i
think
that
i
acquitted
myself
pretty
well
and
that
none
guessed
that
anything
was
amiss
with
me
for
i
spoke
of
the
plays
i
had
seen
in
rome
before
that
i
was
a
novice
and
of
the
singers
that
i
heard
there
and
i
listened
too
to
their
own
speeches
gathering
this
and
that
of
what
they
did
and
where
they
went
if
by
chance
i
might
gather
something
to
their
own
advantage
thereafter
it
was
pretty
to
see
too
how
courteous
and
gallant
ireland
was
with
his
mother
and
sister
and
how
he
put
their
cloaks
about
them
at
the
door
and
feigned
that
he
was
a
constable
to
carry
them
off
to
prison
at
which
my
heart
failed
me
again
for
frequenting
the
company
of
suspected
persons
and
how
he
gave
an
arm
to
each
of
them
as
they
set
off
into
the
dark
that
night
too
as
i
lay
abed
i
thought
much
of
all
this
again
i
had
established
a
great
friendliness
with
the
fathers
by
now
telling
them
i
was
come
up
again
to
london
as
whitbread
had
recommended
me
until
the
court
should
go
again
to
windsor
and
that
perhaps
i
should
go
with
it
thither
they
had
told
me
at
that
that
one
of
their
fathers
was
there
named
bedingfeld
who
was
of
the
oxburgh
family
i
think
and
that
he
was
confessor
to
the
duke
of
york
and
that
they
would
recommend
me
to
him
if
i
should
go
but
all
through
my
anxiety
i
comforted
myself
with
the
assurance
the
king
had
given
to
me
that
whatever
else
might
ensue
not
a
hair
of
their
heads
should
be
touched
for
i
had
great
confidence
in
his
majesty
word
given
so
solemnly
chapter
vi
now
begins
in
earnest
that
chapter
of
horrors
that
will
be
with
me
till
i
die
and
the
learning
of
that
lesson
that
i
might
have
learned
long
before
from
one
that
was
himself
a
prince
and
knew
what
he
was
talking
of
i
mean
king
david
who
bids
us
in
his
psalm
to
put
no
trust
in
princes
nor
in
any
child
of
man
for
several
days
all
passed
peacefully
enough
i
waited
upon
chiffinch
and
asked
whether
the
king
had
spoken
of
me
again
and
was
told
he
had
not
so
i
went
about
my
business
which
was
to
haunt
the
taverns
and
to
frequent
the
company
of
the
jesuits
i
made
an
acquaintance
or
two
in
the
taverns
at
this
time
which
served
me
later
though
not
in
the
particular
manner
that
i
had
wished
but
for
the
most
part
matters
seemed
quiet
enough
men
did
not
speak
a
great
deal
of
the
catholics
and
i
always
fenced
off
questions
by
beginning
in
every
company
that
i
found
myself
in
by
speaking
of
some
church
of
england
divine
with
a
great
deal
of
admiration
soon
earning
for
myself
i
fear
the
name
of
a
pious
and
grave
fellow
but
at
the
same
time
of
a
safe
man
in
matters
of
church
and
state
one
of
these
acquaintances
was
a
rumbald
a
maltster
which
was
all
i
thought
him
then
who
frequented
the
mitre
tavern
without
aldgate
where
i
went
one
day
dressed
in
one
of
my
sober
country
suits
wearing
my
hat
at
a
somewhat
rakish
cock
that
i
might
seem
to
be
a
simple
fellow
that
aped
the
tavern
was
full
when
i
came
to
it
and
called
for
dinner
but
i
made
such
a
that
the
maid
went
to
an
inner
room
and
presently
returning
told
me
i
might
have
my
dinner
there
it
was
a
little
parlour
she
spewed
me
to
with
old
steel
caps
upon
the
wall
and
strewed
rushes
under
foot
and
there
were
three
or
four
men
there
who
had
just
done
dinner
all
but
one
this
one
was
a
ruddy
man
with
red
hair
going
grey
dressed
very
plain
but
well
with
a
hard
kind
of
look
about
him
and
he
had
had
as
much
to
drink
as
a
man
should
have
and
was
in
the
merry
stage
of
his
drink
here
thought
i
is
the
very
man
for
me
he
is
of
both
country
and
town
here
is
a
chamber
of
which
he
seems
lord
for
he
ordered
the
maid
about
royally
and
cursed
her
once
or
twice
and
it
is
a
chamber
apart
from
the
rest
so
i
thought
this
a
very
proper
place
to
hear
some
talk
in
and
a
very
proper
fellow
to
hear
it
from
for
a
while
i
thought
he
had
something
of
the
look
of
an
old
soldier
about
him
but
then
i
thought
no
more
of
it
when
the
others
were
gone
out
and
there
was
a
little
delay
i
too
god
forgive
me
cursed
the
poor
maid
for
a
slut
once
or
twice
and
bade
her
make
haste
with
my
dinner
and
my
manner
had
its
effect
for
the
fellow
warmed
to
me
presently
and
told
me
that
he
was
rumbald
and
i
said
on
my
part
that
my
name
was
mallock
and
we
shook
hands
upon
it
for
that
was
the
mood
of
the
ale
that
was
in
him
but
he
had
other
moods
too
i
learned
later
when
he
was
very
repentant
for
his
drink
i
began
then
to
speak
of
hare
street
and
said
that
i
lodged
there
sometimes
and
then
began
to
speak
of
the
parson
there
and
of
what
a
churchman
he
was
of
hare
street
eh
said
he
why
i
am
not
far
from
there
myself
i
am
of
hoddesdon
or
near
to
it
where
have
you
lodged
in
hare
street
and
what
is
your
business
i
was
in
a
quandary
at
that
for
it
seemed
to
me
then
though
it
was
not
in
reality
a
piece
of
bad
fortune
that
he
should
come
from
thereabouts
i
am
i
said
i
did
some
garden
work
there
for
jermyn
the
papist
the
papist
eh
cried
rumbald
i
would
work
for
the
devil
said
i
if
he
would
pay
me
enough
the
words
appeared
to
rumbald
very
witty
though
god
knows
why
i
suppose
it
was
the
ale
in
him
for
he
laughed
aloud
and
beat
on
his
leg
i
be
bound
you
would
he
said
and
it
was
these
words
of
mine
which
under
god
providence
as
i
think
now
established
my
reputation
with
rumbald
as
a
kind
of
fellow
that
would
do
anything
for
money
he
began
too
at
that
which
pleased
me
better
at
the
time
to
speak
of
precisely
those
matters
of
which
i
wished
to
hear
it
was
not
treasonable
talk
for
the
ale
had
not
driven
all
the
sense
out
of
him
but
it
was
as
near
treasonable
as
might
be
and
it
was
above
all
against
the
catholics
that
he
raged
i
would
not
defile
this
page
by
writing
down
all
that
he
said
but
neither
her
majesty
nor
the
duke
of
york
escaped
his
venom
there
appeared
nothing
too
bad
to
be
said
of
them
and
he
spoke
of
other
names
too
of
the
duchess
of
portsmouth
whom
he
called
by
vile
names
yet
not
viler
than
she
had
rightfully
earned
and
the
duchess
of
cleveland
and
he
began
upon
the
king
but
stopped
himself
but
you
are
a
church
of
england
man
he
said
well
so
am
i
now
at
least
i
call
myself
so
though
i
should
be
a
presbyterian
but
and
he
stopped
again
now
all
this
was
mighty
interesting
to
me
for
it
was
worse
than
anything
i
had
heard
before
and
yet
he
said
it
all
as
if
it
was
common
talk
among
his
kind
where
he
came
from
and
it
was
very
consonant
with
what
the
king
had
set
me
to
do
which
was
to
hear
what
the
common
people
had
to
say
my
gorge
rose
at
the
man
again
and
again
but
i
was
a
tolerable
actor
in
those
days
and
restrained
myself
very
well
when
he
went
at
last
he
clapped
me
on
the
back
as
if
it
were
i
who
had
done
all
the
bragging
you
are
the
right
kind
of
fellow
he
said
and
by
god
i
wish
there
were
more
of
us
you
will
remember
my
name
rumbald
the
maltster
i
am
to
be
heard
of
here
at
any
time
for
i
come
up
on
my
business
every
week
though
i
was
not
always
a
maltster
i
promised
i
would
remember
him
and
indeed
after
a
while
all
england
has
remembered
him
ever
since
it
was
that
same
evening
i
think
for
my
diary
is
confused
at
this
time
and
no
wonder
that
when
i
came
back
to
my
lodgings
about
i
found
that
a
man
had
been
from
chiffinch
to
bid
me
come
to
whitehall
as
soon
as
i
returned
but
the
messenger
had
not
seemed
greatly
perturbed
james
told
me
so
i
changed
my
clothes
and
had
my
supper
and
set
out
it
would
be
about
seven
when
i
came
to
chiffinch
and
when
i
tapped
i
had
no
answer
i
tapped
again
and
then
a
servant
of
chiffinch
came
running
up
the
stairs
who
had
left
his
post
i
suspect
and
asked
me
what
i
wanted
there
when
i
told
him
he
seemed
surprised
and
he
said
that
chiffinch
had
company
in
his
inner
closet
but
that
he
would
speak
with
him
so
he
left
me
standing
there
and
went
through
and
i
heard
a
door
shut
within
presently
he
came
out
again
in
something
of
a
hurry
and
bade
me
come
in
and
to
my
astonishment
we
went
through
the
first
room
that
was
empty
and
out
again
beyond
and
down
a
dark
passage
i
heard
voices
as
i
went
talking
rapidly
somewhere
but
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
then
he
knocked
softly
upon
a
door
at
the
end
of
the
passage
a
voice
cried
to
us
to
come
in
and
i
entered
and
to
my
astonishment
not
only
was
the
little
closet
half
full
of
persons
but
these
persons
were
somewhat
exceptional
at
the
end
of
the
table
that
was
opposite
me
sat
his
majesty
tilting
his
chair
back
a
little
as
if
he
were
weary
of
the
talk
but
his
face
was
flushed
as
if
with
anger
upon
his
right
sat
the
duke
with
his
periwig
pushed
a
little
back
and
his
face
more
flushed
even
than
the
king
opposite
to
the
duke
sat
two
men
whom
i
took
to
be
priests
by
their
faces
one
fair
the
other
dark
and
i
presently
proved
to
be
right
and
beside
him
chiffinch
very
and
lean
talking
at
a
great
speed
with
his
hands
clasped
upon
the
table
finally
my
lord
danby
sat
next
to
the
duke
opposite
to
chiffinch
with
a
sullen
look
upon
his
face
there
was
a
great
heap
of
papers
again
upon
the
table
between
the
five
men
all
these
persons
turned
their
eyes
upon
me
as
i
came
in
and
bowed
low
to
the
company
and
then
chiffinch
jerked
back
a
chair
that
was
beside
him
and
beckoned
to
me
to
sit
down
in
it
the
room
appeared
to
me
a
secret
kind
of
place
with
curtains
pulled
across
the
windows
where
a
man
might
be
very
private
if
he
wished
chiffinch
ended
speaking
as
i
came
in
and
all
sat
silent
his
majesty
broke
the
silence
you
are
very
late
mallock
he
said
no
more
than
that
but
i
felt
the
reproof
very
keenly
tell
him
chiffinch
then
chiffinch
related
to
me
an
extraordinary
story
and
he
told
it
very
well
balancing
the
two
sides
of
it
so
that
i
could
not
tell
what
he
thought
it
appeared
that
a
day
or
two
ago
doctor
tonge
had
come
to
my
lord
danby
in
pursuance
of
the
tale
he
had
told
before
saying
that
he
had
received
further
information
from
the
very
man
whom
he
had
suspected
and
now
had
certified
to
be
the
writer
of
the
first
information
under
heads
to
the
effect
that
a
packet
of
letters
was
on
its
way
to
windsor
to
that
very
bedingfeld
of
whom
whitbread
had
spoken
to
me
on
the
matter
of
the
plot
to
murder
the
king
and
the
duke
too
unless
he
would
consent
to
the
affair
my
lord
danby
posted
immediately
to
windsor
that
he
might
intercept
these
letters
and
examine
them
for
himself
but
found
that
not
only
had
bedingfeld
received
them
but
had
taken
them
to
the
duke
saying
that
he
did
not
understand
one
word
that
was
written
in
them
those
letters
purported
to
have
been
written
from
a
number
of
jesuits
and
others
amongst
whom
were
a
coleman
an
agent
of
the
duke
and
langhorn
a
lawyer
and
related
to
a
supposed
plot
not
only
to
murder
the
king
and
his
brother
too
perhaps
but
to
the
popish
domination
to
burn
westminster
as
they
had
already
burned
the
city
and
that
the
new
positions
in
the
state
had
already
been
designed
to
certain
persons
whose
names
were
all
mentioned
in
the
letters
by
the
holy
father
himself
the
matter
that
was
now
being
discussed
in
this
little
chamber
was
what
was
best
to
be
done
chiffinch
told
me
this
as
shortly
almost
as
i
have
written
it
down
glancing
at
his
majesty
once
or
twice
and
at
the
duke
as
if
he
wished
to
know
whether
he
were
telling
it
properly
and
as
soon
as
he
ended
his
majesty
began
that
is
where
we
stand
now
mallock
as
for
me
i
do
not
believe
one
word
of
the
tale
as
i
have
said
before
and
i
say
that
it
is
best
to
destroy
the
letters
to
tell
doctor
tonge
that
he
is
a
damned
fool
if
not
worse
so
to
be
cozened
and
to
say
no
more
of
it
i
would
not
have
this
made
public
for
a
thousand
pounds
it
is
as
i
said
before
i
knew
that
the
matter
would
grow
and
i
say
sir
put
in
the
duke
savagely
that
your
majesty
forgets
who
it
is
who
are
implicated
that
it
is
these
good
jesuit
fathers
and
my
own
confessor
too
he
bowed
slightly
to
the
fair
man
who
returned
it
and
that
if
the
matter
be
not
probed
to
the
bottom
the
names
of
all
will
suffer
in
the
long
run
brother
brother
said
charles
i
entreat
you
not
to
speak
so
violently
we
all
know
how
good
the
fathers
are
and
do
not
suspect
any
one
of
them
it
is
to
save
their
name
and
i
tell
you
burst
in
james
again
that
mine
is
the
only
way
to
do
it
do
you
think
sir
that
these
folks
who
are
behind
it
all
will
let
the
matter
rest
it
will
grow
and
grow
as
your
majesty
said
and
we
shall
have
half
the
kingdom
involved
here
was
a
very
pretty
dispute
with
sense
on
both
sides
and
yet
there
appeared
to
me
that
there
was
more
on
his
majesty
than
on
the
other
if
even
then
tonge
had
been
sent
for
and
soundly
rated
and
made
to
produce
his
informant
and
the
matter
sifted
i
believe
we
should
have
heard
no
more
of
it
but
it
was
not
ordained
so
they
all
spoke
a
good
deal
appealing
to
the
two
priests
bedingfeld
and
young
and
they
both
gave
their
opinions
presently
charles
was
silent
letting
his
chair
come
forward
again
on
to
its
four
legs
and
putting
his
head
in
his
hands
over
the
table
i
had
never
seen
him
so
perturbed
before
then
i
ventured
on
a
question
sir
may
i
ask
who
is
doctor
tonge
informant
his
majesty
glanced
up
at
me
as
if
he
saw
me
for
the
first
time
tell
him
chiffinch
he
said
his
name
is
doctor
oates
said
the
page
he
was
a
papist
once
and
is
turned
informer
he
says
he
still
feigns
secretly
to
be
friends
with
one
or
two
of
the
jesuits
he
says
but
every
word
you
hear
here
is
mallock
added
the
king
i
knew
no
such
name
and
said
no
more
i
had
never
heard
of
the
man
have
you
anything
to
say
mr
mallock
asked
the
king
presently
i
have
some
reports
to
hand
in
sir
i
said
but
they
do
not
bear
directly
upon
this
matter
the
king
lifted
his
heavy
eyes
and
let
them
fall
again
he
appeared
weary
and
dispirited
when
we
broke
up
at
last
nothing
was
decided
on
the
one
hand
the
letters
were
not
destroyed
and
the
duke
was
still
unforbidden
to
pursue
his
researches
and
on
the
other
there
was
no
permission
for
a
public
inquiry
to
be
held
the
counsels
in
short
were
divided
and
that
is
the
worst
state
of
all
the
duke
said
nothing
to
me
either
at
the
table
or
before
he
went
out
with
bedingfeld
or
mumford
as
he
was
usually
called
he
appeared
to
consider
me
too
young
to
be
of
any
importance
and
to
tolerate
me
only
because
the
king
wished
it
i
handed
to
chiffinch
the
reports
of
what
folks
had
said
to
me
in
taverns
and
elsewhere
and
went
away
the
days
went
by
and
nothing
of
any
importance
appeared
further
i
still
frequented
the
company
of
the
jesuit
fathers
and
the
taverns
as
before
but
no
more
was
heard
until
a
few
days
before
the
end
of
september
on
that
day
i
was
passing
through
the
court
of
whitehall
to
see
if
there
were
anything
for
me
at
chiffinch
for
the
king
was
at
windsor
again
when
i
saw
father
whitbread
and
father
ireland
coming
swiftly
out
from
the
way
that
led
to
the
duke
lodgings
for
he
stayed
here
a
good
deal
during
these
days
they
were
talking
together
and
did
not
see
me
till
i
was
close
upon
them
when
i
greeted
them
they
stopped
all
of
a
sudden
the
very
man
said
whitbread
then
he
asked
me
whether
i
would
come
with
them
to
the
lodgings
of
fenwick
for
they
had
something
to
say
to
me
and
i
went
with
them
very
willingly
for
it
appeared
to
me
that
perhaps
they
had
heard
of
the
matter
which
i
had
found
so
hard
to
keep
from
them
we
said
nothing
at
all
on
the
way
and
when
we
got
within
whitbread
told
grove
to
stand
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
that
no
one
might
come
up
without
his
knowledge
they
bolted
the
door
also
when
we
were
within
the
chamber
then
we
all
sat
down
now
mallock
said
father
whitbread
we
know
all
that
you
know
and
why
you
have
been
with
us
so
much
and
we
thank
you
for
your
trouble
i
said
nothing
but
i
bowed
to
them
a
little
but
i
knew
that
i
had
been
of
little
service
as
yet
it
is
all
out
said
the
priest
or
will
be
in
a
day
or
two
oates
hath
been
to
sir
edmund
berry
godfrey
the
westminster
magistrate
with
the
whole
of
his
pretended
information
his
heads
to
which
he
hath
added
now
more
and
he
will
be
had
before
the
council
sir
edmund
hath
told
coleman
his
friend
and
the
duke
agent
all
that
hath
been
sworn
to
before
him
coleman
hath
told
the
duke
and
hath
fled
from
town
and
the
duke
has
prevailed
with
the
king
to
have
the
whole
affair
before
the
council
i
think
that
his
majesty
way
with
it
would
have
been
the
better
but
it
is
too
late
for
that
now
now
the
matter
must
all
come
out
and
sir
edmund
hath
said
sufficient
to
shew
us
that
it
will
largely
turn
upon
a
consult
that
our
fathers
held
here
in
london
last
april
at
the
white
horse
tavern
for
oates
hath
mingled
truth
and
falsehood
in
a
very
ingenious
fashion
he
was
at
omer
you
know
as
a
student
and
was
expelled
for
an
unspeakable
crime
as
he
was
expelled
from
our
other
college
at
valladolid
also
for
the
same
cause
so
he
knows
a
good
deal
of
our
ways
he
feigns
too
to
be
a
doctor
of
divinity
in
salamanca
university
but
that
is
another
of
his
lies
as
i
know
for
a
truth
what
we
wish
to
know
however
is
how
he
knows
so
much
of
our
movements
during
these
last
months
for
not
one
of
us
has
seen
him
you
have
been
to
and
fro
to
our
lodgings
a
great
deal
mallock
have
you
ever
seen
hanging
about
the
streets
outside
any
of
them
a
fellow
with
a
deformed
kind
of
face
so
that
his
mouth
and
at
that
i
broke
in
for
i
had
never
forgotten
the
man
face
against
whom
i
had
knocked
one
night
in
drury
lane
i
have
seen
the
very
man
i
cried
he
is
of
middle
stature
with
a
little
forehead
and
nose
and
a
great
chin
that
is
the
man
said
whitbread
when
did
you
see
him
i
told
them
that
it
was
on
the
night
that
i
found
ireland
and
her
daughter
come
from
the
play
he
was
standing
in
the
mouth
of
the
passage
opposite
i
said
and
watched
me
as
i
went
in
he
will
have
been
watching
many
nights
i
think
said
whitbread
here
and
in
duke
street
and
at
my
own
lodgings
too
i
asked
what
he
would
do
that
for
if
he
had
his
tale
already
that
he
may
have
more
truth
to
stir
up
with
his
lies
said
whitbread
he
will
say
who
he
has
seen
go
in
and
out
and
we
shall
not
be
able
to
deny
it
he
said
this
very
quietly
without
any
sign
of
perturbation
and
ireland
was
the
same
they
seemed
a
little
thoughtful
only
but
no
harm
can
come
to
you
i
cried
his
majesty
hath
promised
it
yes
his
majesty
hath
promised
it
said
whitbread
in
such
a
manner
that
my
heart
turned
cold
but
i
said
no
more
on
the
point
now
mallock
said
the
priest
we
must
consider
what
is
best
to
be
done
when
the
case
comes
on
as
it
surely
will
the
question
for
us
is
what
you
must
do
i
doubt
not
that
you
could
give
evidence
that
you
have
found
us
harmless
folk
he
smiled
as
he
said
this
but
i
do
not
know
that
you
will
be
able
to
add
much
to
what
other
of
our
witnesses
will
be
able
to
say
i
am
not
at
all
sure
but
that
it
may
not
be
best
for
you
to
keep
away
from
the
case
at
first
at
any
rate
you
have
the
king
ear
which
is
worth
more
to
us
than
any
testimony
you
could
give
why
do
you
not
fly
the
country
i
cried
he
smiled
again
because
that
he
said
would
be
as
much
as
to
say
that
we
were
guilty
and
so
the
whole
society
would
be
thought
guilty
and
the
church
too
no
mallock
we
must
see
the
matter
out
and
trust
to
what
justice
we
can
get
but
i
do
not
think
we
shall
get
a
great
deal
so
it
was
decided
then
that
i
would
not
give
testimony
unless
there
was
some
call
for
it
and
i
took
my
leave
marvelling
at
the
constancy
of
these
men
who
preferred
to
imperil
life
itself
sooner
than
reputation
well
all
went
forward
as
whitbread
had
said
it
would
on
the
day
of
september
oates
appeared
before
the
council
to
give
his
testimony
and
it
was
to
the
same
effect
as
was
that
which
i
had
heard
chiffinch
relate
before
as
to
the
jesuit
plot
to
murder
the
king
and
if
need
be
the
duke
too
and
to
establish
catholic
domination
in
england
i
went
into
a
gallery
in
the
council
room
for
a
little
to
confirm
with
my
own
eyes
whether
it
were
titus
oates
himself
against
whom
i
had
knocked
in
drury
lane
and
it
was
the
man
without
doubt
though
he
looked
very
different
in
his
minister
dress
it
was
not
a
very
great
room
and
only
those
were
admitted
who
had
permission
his
majesty
himself
was
there
upon
the
second
day
and
sat
in
the
midst
of
the
table
at
the
upper
end
with
the
duke
beside
him
and
the
great
officers
round
about
amongst
whom
i
marked
my
lord
shaftesbury
who
i
was
beginning
to
think
knew
more
of
the
plot
than
had
appeared
oates
stood
in
a
little
pew
at
one
side
so
that
when
he
turned
to
speak
i
could
see
his
face
tonge
and
kirby
and
others
sat
on
a
seat
behind
him
he
was
dressed
as
a
minister
for
he
had
been
one
before
his
pretended
reconciliation
to
the
catholic
church
in
gown
and
bands
and
wore
a
great
periwig
and
not
his
face
only
which
no
man
could
forget
who
had
once
set
eyes
on
it
but
the
strange
accent
with
which
he
spoke
confirmed
me
that
it
was
the
man
i
had
seen
my
lord
danby
i
think
it
was
questioned
him
a
good
deal
as
well
as
others
and
he
repeated
the
same
tale
with
great
fluency
with
many
gibes
and
aphorisms
such
as
that
the
jesuits
had
laid
a
wager
that
if
carolus
rex
would
not
become
which
is
roman
catholic
he
should
not
much
longer
remain
he
said
too
that
he
had
been
reconciled
to
the
church
on
ash
wednesday
of
last
year
but
that
he
took
god
and
his
holy
angels
to
witness
that
he
had
never
changed
the
religion
in
his
heart
but
that
it
was
all
a
pretence
to
spy
out
papistical
plots
his
royal
highness
broke
out
when
he
had
done
declaring
the
whole
matter
a
bundle
of
lies
and
when
one
or
two
asked
oates
for
any
writings
or
letters
that
he
had
since
he
had
been
so
long
amongst
the
jesuits
and
was
so
much
trusted
by
them
he
said
that
he
had
none
but
could
get
them
easily
enough
if
warrants
and
officers
were
given
him
i
suppose
the
truth
was
that
he
had
not
wit
enough
to
write
them
as
yet
but
had
thought
the
windsor
letters
as
i
may
call
them
would
be
enough
these
questions
had
also
been
put
to
him
on
the
day
before
but
were
repeated
now
for
the
king
benefit
his
majesty
himself
i
think
proved
the
shrewdest
examiner
of
them
all
you
said
that
you
met
don
juan
the
spaniard
in
your
travels
doctor
oates
pray
what
is
he
like
in
face
and
figure
my
lard
your
majesty
said
oates
he
is
a
tall
black
thin
faylow
with
swatthy
features
for
so
he
pronounced
his
words
eh
asked
the
king
oates
repeated
his
words
and
the
king
turned
nodding
and
smiling
to
his
royal
highness
for
the
spanish
bastard
is
far
more
austrian
than
spanish
and
is
fair
and
fat
and
of
small
stature
excellent
doctor
oates
said
the
king
and
now
there
is
another
small
matter
you
told
these
gentlemen
yesterday
that
you
saw
with
your
own
eyes
the
bribe
of
ten
thousand
pound
paid
down
by
the
french
confessor
pray
where
was
this
money
paid
in
the
jesuits
house
in
paris
your
majesty
said
the
man
and
where
is
that
that
your
majesty
that
house
is
is
near
the
king
own
house
but
he
spoke
hesitatingly
then
the
king
broke
out
in
indignation
and
beat
his
hand
on
the
table
man
he
cried
the
jesuits
have
no
house
within
one
mile
of
the
louvre
it
pleased
me
to
hear
the
king
say
that
for
i
was
a
little
uneasy
at
father
whitbread
manner
when
he
had
spoken
of
the
king
promise
but
i
was
less
pleased
a
day
or
two
afterwards
to
hear
that
his
majesty
was
gone
to
newmarket
to
the
races
and
had
left
the
council
to
do
as
best
it
could
and
that
the
jesuits
had
been
taken
that
same
night
michaelmas
eve
after
oates
had
been
had
before
the
council
there
had
been
a
great
at
the
taking
of
father
whitbread
for
the
spanish
soldiers
had
been
called
out
to
save
the
ambassador
house
so
great
was
the
mob
that
went
to
see
him
taken
the
next
public
event
in
the
whole
affair
was
the
last
and
worst
of
all
the
links
that
were
being
forged
so
swiftly
and
the
news
of
it
came
to
me
as
follows
i
had
gone
to
sup
in
aldgate
where
i
had
listened
to
a
good
deal
of
talk
from
some
small
gentry
as
to
the
papist
plot
and
had
been
happy
to
hear
three
or
four
of
them
declare
that
they
believed
there
was
nothing
in
it
and
even
the
rest
of
them
were
far
from
positive
on
the
matter
and
i
had
stayed
late
over
my
pipe
with
them
so
that
it
was
long
after
my
usual
time
when
i
returned
towards
my
lodgings
walking
alone
for
i
said
to
the
last
of
my
companions
in
the
city
as
i
came
up
into
the
strand
i
saw
before
me
what
appeared
to
be
the
tail
of
a
great
concourse
of
people
and
heard
the
murmur
of
their
voices
and
mending
my
pace
a
little
i
soon
came
up
with
them
i
went
along
for
a
little
trying
to
hear
what
they
were
saying
upon
the
affair
and
to
learn
what
the
matter
was
for
by
now
the
street
was
one
pack
of
folk
all
moving
together
little
by
little
then
i
began
to
hear
that
someone
had
been
strangled
and
that
he
was
found
with
his
neck
broken
and
then
that
his
own
sword
was
run
through
his
heart
and
words
of
that
kind
now
i
had
heard
talk
before
that
sir
edmund
berry
godfrey
was
run
away
with
a
woman
and
to
avoid
the
payment
of
his
debts
which
if
it
were
true
were
certainly
a
very
strange
happening
at
such
a
time
since
he
was
the
magistrate
before
whom
oates
had
laid
his
information
but
six
days
were
gone
by
and
i
had
not
thought
very
much
of
it
for
his
running
away
could
not
now
in
any
way
affect
the
information
that
had
been
laid
he
was
a
very
gentle
man
though
melancholy
and
though
a
good
protestant
troubled
no
man
that
was
of
another
religion
than
himself
neither
papist
nor
independent
but
when
i
heard
the
people
about
me
speaking
in
this
manner
the
name
of
sir
edmund
came
to
my
mind
and
i
asked
a
fellow
that
was
tramping
near
me
who
it
was
that
was
strangled
and
where
the
body
was
but
he
turned
on
me
with
such
a
burst
of
oaths
that
i
thought
it
best
to
draw
no
more
attention
to
myself
and
presently
slipped
away
then
i
thought
myself
of
a
little
rising
ground
a
good
bit
in
advance
whence
perhaps
i
might
be
able
to
see
something
of
what
was
passing
and
i
made
my
way
across
the
street
to
a
lane
that
led
round
on
the
north
as
i
came
across
in
the
fringes
of
the
crowd
i
saw
a
minister
walking
in
his
cassock
so
i
saluted
him
courteously
and
asked
what
the
matter
was
he
looked
at
me
with
an
agitated
face
and
said
nothing
his
lips
worked
and
he
was
very
pale
yet
it
seemed
to
me
with
anger
so
i
asked
him
again
and
this
time
he
answered
sir
i
do
not
know
who
you
are
he
said
but
it
is
sir
edmund
berry
godfrey
who
has
been
foully
murdered
by
the
papists
he
hath
been
found
on
primrose
hill
and
we
are
taking
him
to
his
house
i
do
not
know
sir
but
i
was
gone
and
up
the
lane
as
fast
as
i
could
run
all
that
i
had
heard
all
that
i
had
feared
all
even
that
i
had
dreamed
was
being
fulfilled
the
links
were
forging
swiftly
i
do
not
know
even
now
as
i
write
how
it
was
that
sir
edmund
met
his
end
whether
he
had
killed
himself
as
i
think
for
he
was
of
a
melancholiac
disposition
as
was
his
father
and
his
grandfather
before
him
or
whether
as
indeed
i
think
possible
he
was
murdered
by
the
very
man
who
swore
so
many
catholic
lives
away
by
way
of
giving
colour
to
his
own
designs
for
if
a
man
will
swear
away
twenty
lives
what
should
hinder
him
from
taking
one
one
thing
only
i
know
that
no
catholic
whether
old
or
young
jesuit
or
not
saint
or
sinner
had
any
act
or
part
in
it
and
on
that
i
would
lay
down
my
own
life
by
the
time
that
i
arrived
at
the
rising
mound
for
a
force
mightier
than
prudence
drove
me
to
see
the
end
the
head
of
the
great
concourse
was
beginning
to
arrive
across
the
street
from
side
to
side
stretched
the
company
all
tramping
together
and
murmuring
like
the
sound
of
the
sea
it
was
as
if
all
london
town
was
gone
mad
for
i
do
not
believe
there
were
above
twenty
men
in
that
great
mob
who
were
not
persuaded
that
here
was
the
corroboration
of
all
that
had
been
said
upon
the
matter
of
the
plot
and
that
the
guilt
of
the
papists
was
made
plain
some
roared
as
they
came
threats
and
curses
upon
the
pope
the
jesuits
and
every
catholic
that
drew
breath
but
the
most
part
marched
silently
and
more
terribly
as
it
appeared
to
me
the
street
was
becoming
as
light
as
day
for
torches
were
being
kindled
as
they
came
and
at
the
last
came
the
great
coach
swaying
upon
its
swings
in
which
the
body
was
borne
i
craned
my
head
this
way
and
that
to
see
and
as
the
coach
passed
beneath
me
i
saw
into
its
interior
and
how
there
lay
there
supported
by
two
men
the
figure
of
another
man
whose
face
was
covered
with
a
white
cloth
chapter
vii
it
would
occupy
too
much
space
were
i
to
set
down
in
detail
all
that
passed
between
the
finding
of
sir
edmund
berry
godfrey
body
and
the
being
brought
to
trial
of
the
jesuit
fathers
but
a
brief
summary
must
be
given
the
funeral
of
sir
edmund
was
held
three
or
four
days
later
in
martin
and
the
sermon
was
preached
by
lloyd
his
friend
who
spoke
from
a
pulpit
guarded
by
two
other
thumping
divines
lest
he
should
be
murdered
by
the
papists
as
he
did
it
there
was
a
concourse
of
people
that
can
not
be
imagined
and
ministers
walked
in
canonicals
at
the
head
of
the
procession
lloyd
spoke
of
the
dead
man
as
a
martyr
to
the
protestant
religion
by
the
strangest
stroke
of
parliament
met
ten
days
before
the
funeral
which
happened
on
the
of
october
so
that
the
excitement
of
the
people
greatly
increased
by
the
exhibition
of
the
dead
body
of
sir
godfrey
was
ratified
by
their
rulers
i
say
their
rulers
since
his
majesty
it
appeared
could
do
nothing
to
stem
the
tide
it
was
my
lord
danby
who
opened
the
matter
in
the
house
of
peers
that
he
might
get
what
popularity
he
could
to
protect
him
against
the
disgrace
that
he
foresaw
would
come
upon
him
presently
for
the
french
business
and
every
violent
word
that
he
spoke
was
applauded
to
the
echo
the
house
of
commons
took
up
the
cry
a
solemn
fast
was
appointed
for
the
appeasing
of
god
almighty
wrath
guards
were
set
in
all
the
streets
and
chains
drawn
across
them
to
prevent
any
sudden
rising
of
the
papists
and
all
catholic
householders
were
bidden
to
withdraw
ten
miles
from
london
this
i
did
not
comply
with
for
i
was
no
householder
besides
all
this
both
men
and
women
went
armed
continually
the
men
with
the
protestants
flails
and
ladies
with
little
pistols
hidden
in
their
muffs
workmen
too
were
set
to
search
and
dig
everywhere
for
tewkesbury
as
they
were
called
or
with
which
it
was
thought
that
the
catholics
would
set
london
as
oates
had
said
they
would
or
vast
treasures
which
the
jesuits
were
thought
to
have
buried
in
the
savoy
and
other
places
folks
took
alarm
at
the
leastest
matters
once
my
lord
treasurer
himself
rode
into
london
crying
that
the
french
army
was
already
landed
when
all
that
he
had
seen
were
some
horses
in
the
mist
once
it
was
thought
from
the
noise
of
digging
that
some
heard
that
the
papists
were
mining
to
blow
up
westminster
the
king
whom
i
dared
not
go
to
see
in
all
this
uproar
and
who
did
not
send
for
me
went
to
and
fro
even
in
whitehall
guarded
everywhere
in
private
as
i
heard
pouring
scorn
upon
the
plot
yet
in
public
concealing
his
opinion
and
upon
the
ninth
of
november
he
made
a
speech
in
the
house
of
lords
confirming
all
my
fears
thanking
his
subjects
for
their
devotion
and
urging
them
to
deal
effectually
with
the
popish
recusants
that
were
such
a
danger
to
the
kingdom
in
october
too
five
catholic
lords
the
earl
of
powis
viscount
stafford
my
lord
petre
my
lord
arundell
of
wardour
and
my
lord
bellasis
were
committed
to
the
tower
on
a
charge
of
treason
i
saw
oates
more
than
once
during
these
days
coming
out
of
whitehall
with
the
guards
that
were
given
to
protect
him
carrying
himself
very
high
in
his
minister
dress
and
no
wonder
for
the
man
was
the
darling
of
the
nation
and
was
called
its
saviour
and
had
had
a
great
pension
voted
to
him
of
twelve
hundred
pounds
a
year
he
did
not
think
then
i
warrant
of
the
day
when
he
would
be
whipped
from
newgate
to
tyburn
at
a
cart
tail
and
again
laid
upon
a
sled
and
whipped
again
through
the
city
for
that
he
could
not
stand
by
reason
of
his
first
punishment
another
fellow
too
had
come
forward
named
bedloe
once
a
to
my
lord
bellasis
who
had
given
himself
up
at
bristol
with
information
as
he
called
it
as
to
sir
edmund
murder
which
he
said
had
been
done
in
somerset
house
itself
by
the
priests
and
others
saying
that
the
wax
that
was
found
upon
the
dead
man
breeches
came
from
the
candles
of
the
altar
that
the
priests
had
held
over
him
while
they
did
it
presently
too
at
the
trial
and
even
before
it
bedloe
made
his
evidence
to
concur
with
oates
though
at
the
first
there
was
no
sign
of
it
even
before
the
trial
however
the
audacity
of
the
two
villains
waxed
so
great
as
even
to
seek
to
embroil
her
majesty
herself
in
the
matter
and
to
make
her
privy
to
the
whole
plot
and
this
oates
did
at
the
bar
of
the
house
of
commons
but
the
king
was
so
wrath
at
this
that
little
more
was
heard
of
it
the
duke
of
york
during
these
proceedings
saved
himself
very
well
when
the
bill
for
the
disabling
of
papists
from
the
holding
of
office
or
of
sitting
in
either
house
of
parliament
had
passed
through
the
commons
he
made
a
speech
upon
it
in
the
house
of
lords
speaking
so
well
that
others
as
well
as
he
were
moved
to
tears
by
it
he
said
that
his
religion
should
be
a
matter
between
his
soul
and
god
only
and
should
never
affect
his
public
conduct
and
this
with
so
much
weight
that
the
decision
was
given
in
his
favour
since
he
was
the
brother
i
should
never
have
thought
that
he
could
have
done
so
well
coleman
was
the
first
to
be
brought
to
trial
at
the
beginning
of
december
for
he
came
back
and
gave
himself
up
the
day
after
he
had
at
first
fled
he
was
already
for
so
violent
was
the
feeling
against
the
papists
that
my
lord
lucas
said
in
the
house
of
lords
that
if
he
could
have
his
way
he
would
not
have
even
a
popish
cat
to
mew
and
purr
about
the
king
coleman
i
say
was
the
first
of
those
who
had
before
been
accused
but
a
stayley
a
catholic
banker
who
had
his
house
not
far
from
me
in
covent
garden
was
even
before
him
judged
and
executed
on
account
of
some
words
that
a
lying
scotsman
had
said
he
had
heard
him
use
in
the
tavern
in
the
same
place
i
did
not
go
to
the
trial
of
coleman
for
that
i
had
nothing
to
say
for
him
and
indeed
coleman
own
letters
written
three
or
four
years
ago
were
the
severest
witnesses
against
him
in
which
he
had
written
to
father
la
chaise
whom
oates
at
first
called
father
le
shee
the
french
king
confessor
and
others
that
if
he
could
lay
hands
on
a
good
sum
of
money
he
could
accomplish
a
great
project
he
had
for
the
restoration
of
the
catholic
religion
in
england
these
letters
were
found
in
a
drawer
he
had
forgotten
when
he
had
burned
all
the
rest
and
proved
very
unfortunate
for
him
he
meant
by
this
i
have
no
doubt
the
bribing
of
many
to
win
toleration
and
to
get
his
royal
highness
restored
as
lord
high
admiral
he
said
this
was
his
meaning
and
i
see
no
reason
to
doubt
it
for
he
was
a
pragmatical
kind
of
man
full
of
great
affairs
but
chief
justice
scroggs
waved
it
all
away
and
it
was
made
to
appear
exactly
consonant
with
all
that
oates
and
bedloe
had
said
as
to
the
project
of
killing
the
king
so
great
was
the
excitement
not
of
the
common
people
only
but
of
those
who
should
have
known
better
and
so
shrewd
were
these
who
took
advantage
of
it
that
my
lord
shaftesbury
who
was
waxing
very
hot
upon
the
supposed
plot
for
his
own
ends
was
heard
to
say
that
any
man
that
threw
doubt
on
the
plot
must
be
treated
as
an
enemy
coleman
was
executed
at
tyburn
on
the
third
day
of
december
the
trial
of
father
ireland
grove
and
pickering
who
was
a
benedictine
was
opened
on
the
seventeenth
day
of
december
in
the
sessions
house
at
justice
hall
in
the
old
bailey
i
was
in
the
court
early
before
the
trial
began
carrying
a
letter
with
me
which
chiffinch
got
for
me
from
my
lord
peterborough
that
i
might
have
a
good
place
and
i
had
a
very
good
one
for
it
was
in
a
little
gallery
that
looked
down
into
the
well
of
the
court
so
that
i
could
see
all
that
i
wished
and
the
faces
of
all
the
prisoners
judges
and
witnesses
and
yet
by
leaning
back
could
avoid
observation
for
i
had
no
wish
for
others
sake
if
not
for
my
own
to
be
recognized
by
any
of
the
witnesses
the
seats
for
my
lords
were
on
the
left
under
a
state
with
their
desks
before
them
the
place
for
the
prisoners
on
the
right
facing
the
judges
and
for
the
witnesses
opposite
to
me
the
jury
was
beneath
and
the
counsels
in
front
of
them
with
their
backs
to
me
when
the
court
was
full
to
bursting
my
lords
came
in
with
the
chief
justice
that
is
sir
william
scroggs
in
the
midst
i
had
never
seen
him
before
though
i
knew
how
hot
he
was
against
catholics
and
i
looked
to
see
what
he
was
like
it
was
a
dark
morning
and
the
candles
were
lighted
on
my
lords
desks
and
i
could
see
his
face
pretty
well
in
their
light
he
was
in
scarlet
and
wore
his
great
wig
and
he
talked
behind
his
hand
with
what
seemed
a
great
deal
of
merriment
to
justice
bertue
who
sat
on
one
side
of
him
and
the
recorder
jeffreys
who
sat
upon
the
other
he
had
very
heavy
brows
his
face
was
and
his
mouth
was
like
a
trap
when
he
shut
it
and
looked
grave
as
he
did
so
soon
as
the
clerk
had
done
his
formalities
he
was
a
strong
man
i
thought
who
would
brook
no
opposition
and
would
have
his
way
as
indeed
he
did
and
the
rest
of
my
lords
had
little
or
no
say
in
the
proceedings
and
least
of
all
had
the
jury
except
to
do
what
the
lord
chief
justice
bid
them
the
three
prisoners
for
whitbread
and
fenwick
were
presently
withdrawn
to
be
tried
later
since
they
could
not
get
two
false
witnesses
against
them
at
that
time
were
ireland
grove
and
pickering
and
i
looked
upon
them
with
infinite
compassion
to
see
how
they
would
bear
themselves
pickering
i
had
never
seen
before
so
i
could
not
tell
whether
or
no
he
bore
himself
as
usual
but
the
two
others
i
had
seen
again
and
again
yet
with
respect
to
them
both
i
remembered
principally
that
occasion
when
ireland
had
entertained
his
mother
and
sister
in
fenwick
lodging
on
that
one
night
he
was
in
town
and
gone
off
with
them
into
the
dark
so
merrily
and
grove
had
brought
up
the
chocolate
in
white
cups
and
we
had
all
been
merry
together
now
they
stood
here
in
the
dock
together
and
answered
to
their
names
cheerfully
and
courageously
and
i
could
see
that
neither
anguish
of
heart
nor
the
fear
of
death
had
availed
to
change
their
countenances
in
the
leastest
degree
they
stood
there
scarcely
moving
except
once
or
twice
to
whisper
to
one
another
while
oates
told
his
lying
tale
it
was
now
for
the
first
time
that
i
understood
how
shrewdly
and
yet
how
clumsily
now
and
then
the
man
had
weaved
together
his
information
he
spoke
with
an
abundance
of
detail
that
astonished
me
he
spoke
of
names
and
places
with
the
greatest
precision
he
related
how
himself
had
been
sent
from
omer
with
fifty
pounds
promised
him
to
kill
tonge
who
had
lately
translated
a
book
from
the
french
named
the
jesuits
morals
he
spoke
of
a
chapel
in
sanders
house
at
where
he
had
been
present
he
said
at
a
piece
of
conspiring
and
so
forth
continually
interlarding
his
tale
with
bursts
of
adjuration
and
piety
and
indignation
so
evidently
feigned
though
with
something
of
the
puritan
manner
in
it
that
i
marvelled
that
any
man
could
be
deceived
who
did
not
wish
to
be
and
all
with
his
vile
accent
he
spoke
much
also
as
whitbread
had
told
me
that
he
would
of
the
consult
of
the
fathers
of
all
that
is
who
had
the
in
england
that
had
been
held
at
the
white
horse
tavern
in
the
strand
in
april
pretending
that
at
this
the
murder
of
the
king
was
again
decided
upon
and
designed
too
in
all
particulars
how
pickering
and
grove
had
been
deputed
to
do
the
killing
in
park
with
screwed
pistols
as
his
majesty
walked
there
or
if
not
there
at
newmarket
or
windsor
and
how
commissions
had
been
given
to
various
persons
whom
he
named
which
they
were
to
hold
in
the
army
that
was
to
be
raised
when
his
majesty
had
been
murdered
and
the
french
king
louis
let
in
with
his
troops
worst
of
all
however
was
the
assertion
which
he
made
again
and
again
that
no
catholic
oath
even
in
court
could
be
taken
to
be
worth
anything
since
the
pope
gave
them
all
dispensations
to
swear
falsely
for
such
an
assertion
as
this
deprives
an
accused
man
of
all
favour
with
the
jury
and
destroys
the
testimonies
of
all
catholic
witnesses
and
what
amazed
me
most
of
all
was
that
chief
justice
scroggs
supported
him
in
this
and
repeated
it
to
the
jury
again
and
again
he
said
so
first
to
whitbread
before
he
was
withdrawn
if
you
have
a
religion
he
said
that
can
give
a
dispensation
for
oaths
sacraments
protestations
and
falsehoods
how
can
you
expect
that
we
should
believe
you
i
know
no
such
thing
said
whitbread
very
tranquilly
bedloe
too
told
the
same
tale
as
he
had
told
before
but
with
many
embellishments
and
was
treated
by
my
lords
with
as
much
respect
very
nearly
as
oates
himself
and
they
were
both
given
refreshment
by
the
chief
justice
order
i
could
have
found
it
in
my
heart
to
kill
that
man
oates
i
mean
as
he
stood
there
in
his
gown
and
bands
and
periwig
with
his
guards
behind
him
swearing
away
those
good
men
lives
now
standing
upright
now
leaning
on
the
rail
before
him
and
now
reposing
himself
on
a
stool
that
was
brought
for
him
his
monstrous
countenance
was
as
the
face
of
a
devil
he
feigned
now
to
weep
now
to
be
merry
but
most
of
all
i
hated
the
man
when
the
piteous
sight
was
seen
of
the
entrance
of
ireland
and
her
daughter
who
came
to
testify
that
ireland
was
not
in
london
at
all
on
those
days
in
august
when
oates
had
sworn
that
he
had
spoken
with
him
there
they
stood
there
as
gallant
women
as
might
be
turning
their
eyes
now
and
again
upon
the
priest
who
was
all
the
world
to
them
by
ties
both
of
nature
and
grace
but
all
their
testimony
went
for
nothing
since
first
my
lord
had
told
the
jury
that
a
catholic
oath
was
worth
nothing
and
next
the
prisoners
had
had
no
opportunity
to
know
what
charges
precisely
they
were
that
were
to
be
brought
against
them
and
had
had
therefore
no
time
to
get
their
witnesses
together
they
complained
very
sharply
of
this
but
my
lord
puffed
it
all
away
and
would
scarcely
allow
them
to
finish
one
sentence
without
interruption
ireland
said
upon
one
occasion
that
though
he
had
no
witnesses
for
he
had
had
no
time
to
get
them
yet
he
could
get
witnesses
that
there
were
witnesses
i
know
said
the
chief
justice
what
your
way
of
arguing
is
that
is
very
pretty
you
have
witnesses
that
can
prove
you
have
witnesses
and
those
witnesses
can
prove
that
you
have
more
witnesses
and
so
and
thus
you
argue
in
everything
you
do
it
was
growing
dark
when
the
evidence
for
so
it
was
called
was
done
and
the
end
was
drawing
near
and
the
candles
which
had
been
put
out
long
ago
were
lighted
again
by
an
usher
who
came
in
with
a
taper
when
the
lord
chief
justice
called
for
lights
but
the
candles
burned
very
badly
by
reason
of
the
closeness
of
the
court
in
which
so
many
persons
had
been
gathered
for
so
long
and
shed
but
a
poor
illumination
my
eyes
were
weary
too
with
staring
upon
the
people
now
upon
the
monstrous
face
of
oates
that
was
like
a
nightmare
for
terror
now
upon
the
prisoners
so
patient
in
the
dock
and
now
upon
my
lords
on
their
high
seats
beneath
the
state
and
especially
upon
that
hard
and
bitter
face
of
chief
justice
scroggs
who
if
ever
a
man
murdered
innocent
folk
was
murdering
the
three
men
before
him
by
the
direction
which
he
gave
to
the
jury
and
the
manner
he
conducted
the
case
i
could
by
now
see
the
faces
only
one
by
one
as
each
leant
into
the
light
of
the
candles
and
it
appeared
to
me
again
and
again
that
these
were
mocking
demons
and
not
men
and
oates
the
lord
of
them
all
and
of
hell
itself
from
which
they
all
came
and
to
which
they
must
return
i
closed
my
eyes
sometimes
both
to
rest
them
and
that
i
might
pray
for
bare
justice
to
be
done
but
my
prayers
were
to
me
like
the
lifting
of
weights
too
great
for
my
strength
one
hope
only
remained
to
me
and
that
lay
in
his
majesty
for
although
he
had
permitted
the
deaths
of
coleman
and
of
stayley
these
might
indeed
have
appeared
guilty
to
one
who
knew
nothing
of
them
but
i
could
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
believe
that
he
would
suffer
these
jesuits
to
die
of
whom
he
had
sworn
to
me
that
not
a
hair
of
their
heads
should
be
injured
i
had
determined
too
to
go
to
his
majesty
so
soon
as
the
trial
was
done
and
the
verdict
given
as
i
knew
it
would
be
and
hear
from
his
own
lips
that
he
would
keep
his
word
at
whatever
cost
to
himself
it
was
dark
then
by
the
time
that
all
the
evidence
had
been
given
and
the
chief
justice
had
done
his
directing
of
the
jury
the
court
crowded
though
it
was
with
the
people
was
as
still
as
death
so
soon
as
the
jury
came
back
after
a
very
short
recess
i
could
hear
only
the
breathing
of
the
folks
on
all
hands
a
woman
sat
beside
me
who
had
been
as
early
as
myself
that
morning
but
she
had
roared
and
clapped
with
the
rest
at
the
earlier
stages
when
the
chief
justice
had
silenced
the
prisoners
or
thrown
doubt
upon
what
they
said
she
was
quiet
now
however
and
i
wondered
how
the
evidence
had
affected
her
when
the
jury
were
ready
to
give
their
verdict
the
talking
that
had
broken
out
a
little
grew
silent
again
but
when
the
verdict
of
guilty
was
given
it
broke
out
once
more
into
a
storm
of
shouting
so
that
the
rafters
rang
with
it
the
woman
beside
me
for
i
sat
at
the
end
of
a
bench
and
had
nothing
but
the
wall
beyond
me
appeared
to
awaken
at
the
tumult
and
join
her
voice
to
it
beating
with
her
hand
at
the
edge
of
the
gallery
in
front
of
her
as
for
me
i
looked
at
the
prisoners
they
were
all
upright
in
their
places
ireland
in
the
midst
of
the
three
and
were
as
still
as
if
nothing
were
the
matter
they
were
looking
at
the
lord
chief
justice
at
whom
i
too
turned
my
eyes
and
saw
he
was
grinning
and
talking
behind
his
hand
to
the
recorder
it
was
a
very
travesty
of
justice
that
i
was
looking
at
and
no
true
trial
at
all
there
were
a
thousand
points
of
dissonance
that
i
had
remarked
myself
as
to
how
it
was
for
instance
that
one
fellow
had
been
promised
twenty
guineas
for
killing
the
king
and
another
fifteen
hundred
pounds
as
to
how
it
was
that
oates
who
professed
himself
so
loyal
had
permitted
four
ruffians
to
go
to
windsor
as
he
said
with
intent
to
murder
the
king
and
that
he
had
said
nothing
of
it
at
the
time
but
all
was
passed
over
in
this
lust
for
the
jesuits
blood
i
knew
that
my
lord
would
make
a
great
speech
on
the
affair
before
he
would
make
an
end
and
give
sentence
for
this
was
a
great
opportunity
for
him
to
curry
favour
not
only
with
the
people
but
with
men
like
my
lord
shaftesbury
who
was
behind
him
in
all
the
matter
and
as
i
had
no
wish
to
hear
what
he
would
have
to
say
for
i
knew
it
all
by
heart
already
and
still
less
to
hear
the
terrible
words
of
the
sentence
for
high
treason
passed
upon
these
three
good
men
in
the
dock
i
rose
up
quietly
from
my
place
and
slipped
out
of
the
door
by
which
i
had
come
in
as
i
was
about
to
close
the
door
behind
me
i
heard
silence
made
and
my
lord
justice
scroggs
beginning
his
speech
and
these
were
the
words
which
first
he
addressed
to
the
jury
gentlemen
he
said
you
have
done
like
very
good
subjects
and
very
good
christians
that
is
to
say
like
very
good
protestants
and
now
much
good
may
their
thirty
thousand
masses
do
them
when
he
said
this
he
was
referring
to
a
piece
of
oates
lying
evidence
as
to
a
part
of
the
reward
that
they
should
get
for
killing
the
king
but
i
closed
the
door
for
i
could
bear
to
hear
no
more
but
afterwards
i
heard
that
they
then
adjourned
for
an
hour
or
two
and
that
it
was
the
recorder
sir
george
jeffreys
that
gave
sentence
when
i
presented
myself
half
an
hour
later
at
lodgings
i
had
very
nearly
persuaded
myself
that
all
would
yet
be
well
for
i
thought
it
impossible
that
any
man
to
whom
the
report
of
the
trial
should
be
brought
could
ever
think
that
justice
had
been
done
least
of
all
the
king
who
is
the
fount
of
it
under
god
i
knew
very
well
that
his
majesty
would
have
to
bear
the
brunt
of
some
unpopularity
if
he
refused
to
sign
the
warrants
for
their
death
but
he
appeared
to
me
to
care
not
very
much
for
popularity
since
he
outraged
it
often
enough
in
worse
ways
than
in
maintaining
the
right
he
had
said
to
me
too
so
expressly
that
no
harm
should
come
to
the
fathers
or
to
grove
and
pickering
either
and
he
had
said
so
i
was
informed
even
more
forcibly
to
the
duke
and
those
that
were
with
him
saying
that
his
right
hand
should
rot
off
if
ever
he
took
the
pen
into
his
hand
for
such
a
purpose
i
remembered
these
things
even
while
the
plaudits
of
the
crowd
still
rang
in
my
ears
and
the
bitter
cruelty
of
my
lord
chief
words
to
the
jury
his
majesty
i
said
to
myself
is
above
all
these
lesser
folk
and
will
see
that
no
wrong
is
done
and
besides
all
this
he
is
half
a
catholic
himself
and
he
knows
against
what
kind
of
men
these
charges
have
been
made
i
was
pretty
reassured
then
when
i
knocked
upon
the
door
of
chiffinch
lodgings
and
told
the
man
who
opened
to
me
that
i
must
see
his
master
he
took
me
through
immediately
into
the
little
passage
i
had
been
in
before
and
himself
tapped
upon
the
door
of
the
inner
parlour
then
he
opened
it
and
let
me
through
for
chiffinch
was
accustomed
by
now
to
receive
me
at
any
hour
he
rose
civilly
enough
and
asked
me
what
i
wished
with
him
so
soon
as
the
door
was
shut
the
verdict
is
given
i
said
i
must
see
his
majesty
he
screwed
up
his
lips
in
a
way
he
had
it
is
guilty
i
suppose
he
said
i
told
him
yes
and
i
have
never
seen
i
said
such
a
travesty
of
justice
he
looked
down
upon
the
table
considering
drumming
his
fingers
upon
it
that
is
as
may
be
he
said
but
as
for
his
majesty
i
broke
out
on
him
at
that
for
i
was
fiercely
excited
man
i
cried
there
is
no
question
about
that
i
must
see
his
majesty
instantly
he
looked
at
me
again
as
if
considering
well
he
said
what
must
be
must
i
will
see
his
majesty
he
is
not
yet
gone
to
supper
at
the
door
he
turned
again
the
verdict
was
guilty
he
said
you
were
there
and
heard
it
i
told
him
yes
for
i
was
all
impatient
and
how
was
that
verdict
received
in
court
it
was
applauded
i
said
shortly
he
still
waited
an
instant
then
he
went
out
i
was
all
in
a
fever
till
he
came
back
for
his
manner
and
his
hesitation
had
renewed
my
terrors
yet
still
i
would
not
let
myself
doubt
i
went
up
and
down
the
room
and
looked
at
the
pictures
in
it
there
was
a
little
one
by
lely
not
finished
of
my
lady
castlemaine
done
before
she
was
made
duchess
which
i
suppose
the
king
had
given
to
him
but
i
remembered
afterwards
nothing
else
that
i
saw
at
that
time
in
about
half
an
hour
he
came
back
again
but
he
shut
the
door
behind
him
before
he
spoke
his
majesty
will
see
you
in
a
few
minutes
he
said
but
he
goes
to
supper
presently
and
must
not
be
detained
and
there
is
something
else
that
i
must
ask
you
first
i
was
all
impatient
to
be
gone
but
impatience
would
not
help
me
at
all
mallock
he
said
sitting
down
did
you
see
any
man
following
you
from
the
court
or
at
the
doors
of
the
palace
my
heart
stood
still
when
he
said
that
for
though
i
had
done
my
best
at
all
times
for
the
last
month
or
two
to
pass
unnoticed
so
far
as
i
could
i
had
known
well
enough
that
having
been
so
much
with
the
jesuits
as
i
had
it
was
not
impossible
that
i
had
been
marked
by
some
spy
or
other
or
even
by
oates
himself
since
he
had
seen
me
go
into
lodgings
but
i
had
fancied
of
late
that
i
must
have
escaped
notice
and
had
been
more
bold
lately
as
in
going
to
the
court
followed
i
said
what
do
you
mean
mr
chiffinch
you
saw
no
fellow
after
you
or
loitering
near
at
the
gates
as
you
came
in
i
saw
no
one
i
said
the
gates
were
barred
as
usual
yes
i
said
and
the
guard
fetched
a
lieutenant
before
he
would
let
me
in
for
ever
since
the
late
alarms
extraordinary
precautions
had
been
taken
in
keeping
the
great
gates
of
the
palace
always
guarded
and
you
saw
no
one
after
you
no
one
i
said
well
said
chiffinch
a
fellow
was
after
you
for
when
you
were
gone
in
he
came
up
to
the
guard
and
asked
who
you
were
and
by
what
right
you
had
entered
the
lieutenant
sent
a
mail
to
tell
me
so
and
i
met
him
in
the
passage
as
i
went
out
who
was
the
fellow
oh
a
man
called
dangerfield
the
lieutenant
very
prudently
detained
him
and
i
went
across
and
questioned
him
before
i
went
to
his
majesty
i
know
nothing
of
the
man
except
that
he
hath
been
convicted
for
i
saw
the
branding
in
his
hand
when
we
examined
him
we
let
him
go
again
immediately
he
knows
my
name
chiffinch
smiled
we
are
not
so
foolish
as
that
mallock
he
thinks
you
have
some
place
at
court
but
we
did
not
satisfy
him
as
to
your
name
i
said
nothing
for
there
was
nothing
to
say
you
had
best
be
very
careful
mallock
went
on
the
page
standing
up
again
you
have
been
mixing
a
great
deal
with
unpopular
folks
you
will
be
of
no
service
to
his
majesty
at
all
if
you
fall
under
suspicion
you
had
best
go
back
by
water
to
the
temple
stairs
he
spoke
a
little
coldly
and
i
perceived
that
he
thought
i
had
been
indiscreet
well
he
said
we
had
best
be
going
to
his
majesty
lodgings
i
had
flattered
myself
up
to
the
present
that
i
knew
his
capacities
tolerably
well
i
thought
him
to
be
an
easily
read
man
with
both
virtues
and
vices
uppermost
wearing
his
heart
on
his
sleeve
as
the
saying
is
indolent
witty
lacking
all
yet
not
as
i
might
say
a
deep
man
i
was
to
learn
the
truth
or
rather
begin
to
learn
it
on
this
very
night
when
i
entered
his
private
closet
he
was
sitting
not
where
i
had
seen
him
before
but
at
the
great
table
in
the
midst
of
the
floor
with
his
papers
about
him
and
an
appearance
of
great
industry
he
did
not
do
more
than
look
up
for
an
instant
and
then
down
again
and
i
stood
there
before
him
after
i
had
bowed
and
been
taken
no
notice
of
as
it
were
a
scholar
waiting
to
be
whipped
he
was
all
ready
for
supper
in
his
lace
with
his
hat
on
his
head
and
he
was
writing
a
letter
with
a
pair
of
candles
burning
before
him
in
silver
candlesticks
his
face
wore
a
very
heavy
and
preoccupied
look
and
i
was
astonished
that
he
paid
me
no
attention
he
finished
at
last
threw
sand
on
the
paper
from
the
and
pushed
it
aside
then
he
leaned
his
cheeks
in
his
hands
and
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
looked
at
me
but
he
did
not
speak
unkindly
here
you
are
then
he
said
and
i
hear
you
bring
news
from
the
old
bailey
i
came
from
there
half
an
hour
ago
sir
ah
and
the
verdict
was
guilty
chiffinch
tells
me
yes
sir
how
did
the
people
take
it
they
applauded
a
great
deal
sir
they
applauded
you
say
at
the
end
only
or
all
the
while
they
applauded
sir
whenever
any
of
my
lords
made
a
hit
against
the
catholics
were
there
any
who
did
otherwise
not
one
sir
that
i
could
hear
the
chief
justice
what
did
he
say
he
made
many
protestations
of
devotion
to
your
majesty
sir
and
to
the
protestant
religion
he
beat
down
the
catholics
at
every
point
he
permitted
none
of
their
witnesses
to
speak
freely
the
king
was
silent
a
moment
then
he
went
on
again
and
the
prisoners
how
did
they
bear
themselves
they
bore
themselves
like
gallant
gentlemen
sir
they
fought
every
point
so
far
as
the
chief
justice
would
permit
them
did
they
shew
any
fear
when
the
verdict
was
brought
in
none
sir
they
relied
upon
your
majesty
protection
no
doubt
again
his
majesty
was
silent
i
still
stood
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
from
him
waiting
to
say
what
i
had
to
say
the
king
shewed
no
sign
of
having
heard
what
i
had
last
said
then
to
my
astonishment
he
turned
on
me
again
very
sharply
mallock
he
said
i
have
a
fault
to
find
with
you
chiffinch
tells
me
that
you
were
followed
from
the
court
and
that
a
fellow
was
asking
after
you
at
the
gate
you
say
that
you
wish
to
serve
me
well
those
who
serve
me
must
be
very
discreet
and
very
shrewd
plainly
you
have
not
been
so
in
this
instance
you
are
a
very
young
man
and
i
do
not
wish
to
be
severe
but
you
must
remember
mallock
that
such
a
thing
as
this
must
not
happen
any
more
my
mouth
was
gone
suddenly
dry
at
this
attack
of
his
majesty
upon
me
i
licked
my
lips
with
my
tongue
in
readiness
to
answer
but
before
i
could
speak
the
king
went
on
again
now
i
had
a
little
business
to
entrust
to
you
but
i
am
not
sure
if
it
be
not
best
to
give
it
to
another
hand
he
took
up
from
the
table
before
him
a
newly
sealed
little
packet
that
i
had
not
noticed
before
and
sat
weighing
it
in
his
hand
as
if
considering
while
his
eyes
searched
my
face
sir
i
began
yes
mallock
i
know
what
you
would
say
that
is
all
very
well
but
my
servants
must
not
make
mistakes
such
as
you
have
made
it
was
the
height
of
madness
for
you
to
go
to
the
court
at
all
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
were
seen
there
and
followed
and
you
could
have
been
of
no
service
to
your
friends
there
in
any
case
chiffinch
tells
me
he
will
provide
a
wherry
for
you
immediately
that
you
may
go
back
without
observation
you
must
do
this
the
question
before
my
mind
is
as
to
whether
you
shall
take
this
packet
with
you
or
not
what
do
you
say
mr
mallock
all
the
while
he
had
been
speaking
i
had
been
in
a
torment
of
misery
as
yet
i
had
done
little
or
nothing
for
his
majesty
after
all
my
commissioning
from
rome
and
now
that
the
first
piece
of
work
was
on
hand
it
was
doubtful
whether
i
had
not
forfeited
it
by
my
clumsiness
for
the
moment
i
forgot
what
i
had
come
for
i
was
all
set
on
acquitting
myself
well
i
was
but
years
old
sir
i
cried
if
your
majesty
will
entrust
that
to
me
you
shall
never
repent
it
he
smiled
but
his
face
went
back
again
to
its
heaviness
it
is
a
very
difficult
commission
he
said
and
what
is
of
more
importance
than
all
else
is
that
the
packet
should
fall
into
no
hand
other
than
the
one
that
should
have
it
for
this
reason
there
is
no
name
written
upon
it
but
i
have
sealed
it
with
a
private
signet
of
my
own
both
within
and
without
and
you
must
bear
the
packet
with
you
until
you
can
deliver
it
i
understand
sir
i
can
send
no
courier
with
it
for
the
reasons
of
which
i
have
spoken
no
man
mallock
but
you
and
i
must
know
of
its
very
existence
neither
can
i
tell
you
now
to
whom
the
packet
must
be
given
you
must
bear
it
with
you
sir
until
you
have
a
message
from
me
signed
with
the
same
seal
as
that
which
it
bears
telling
you
where
you
must
take
it
and
to
whom
you
understand
i
understand
sir
you
must
leave
london
immediately
until
your
face
is
forgotten
and
until
this
storm
is
over
you
have
a
cousin
in
the
country
yes
sir
jermyn
at
hare
street
you
had
best
lie
there
for
the
present
and
i
can
send
to
you
there
so
soon
as
i
have
an
opportunity
meanwhile
you
must
have
this
always
at
hand
and
be
ready
to
set
out
with
it
so
soon
as
you
hear
where
you
must
go
with
it
that
is
all
plain
mr
mallock
i
understand
sir
the
king
rose
abruptly
pushing
back
his
chair
and
as
he
rose
i
heard
the
trumpets
for
supper
in
the
court
outside
then
you
had
best
be
gone
take
it
mr
mallock
i
came
round
and
received
the
packet
and
i
kissed
the
king
hand
which
he
had
not
given
to
me
as
i
had
come
in
my
heart
was
overjoyed
at
the
confidence
which
he
shewed
me
and
i
slipped
the
packet
immediately
within
my
waistcoat
it
was
square
and
flat
and
lay
there
easily
in
a
little
pocket
which
the
tailor
had
contrived
there
then
as
i
stood
up
again
the
memory
of
what
i
had
come
for
flashed
back
on
me
again
sir
i
said
there
is
one
other
matter
his
majesty
was
already
turning
away
but
he
stopped
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
eh
he
said
sir
it
is
with
regard
to
the
jesuits
who
were
condemned
he
jerked
his
hand
impatiently
in
a
way
he
had
i
have
no
time
for
that
he
said
no
time
then
he
was
gone
out
at
the
other
door
and
i
heard
him
going
downstairs
now
as
i
came
downstairs
again
the
further
way
and
heard
the
trumpets
go
to
shew
that
the
king
was
come
out
i
had
no
suspicion
of
anything
but
my
own
foolishness
in
not
speaking
of
what
i
had
come
about
but
by
the
time
that
i
was
at
the
temple
stairs
i
wondered
whether
or
no
the
king
had
not
had
that
very
design
to
put
me
off
from
which
i
wished
to
say
and
at
the
present
time
i
am
certain
of
it
that
his
majesty
wished
to
hear
from
me
at
once
of
the
proceedings
at
the
trial
and
then
spoke
immediately
of
that
other
matter
of
the
packet
and
of
my
being
followed
to
the
palace
gates
with
the
express
purpose
of
hindering
me
from
saying
anything
for
i
am
sure
that
at
this
time
he
had
not
yet
made
up
his
mind
as
to
what
he
would
do
when
the
warrants
were
brought
to
him
and
did
not
wish
to
speak
of
it
chapter
viii
the
first
thing
that
i
did
when
i
got
home
was
to
call
for
my
man
james
and
bid
him
shut
the
door
my
man
was
about
forty
years
old
and
he
had
been
got
for
me
in
rome
having
fallen
ill
there
in
the
service
of
my
lord
stafford
being
himself
a
catholic
and
a
very
good
one
for
he
went
to
the
sacraments
three
or
four
times
in
the
year
wherever
he
was
he
was
a
fellow
and
very
sturdy
and
quick
and
a
good
hand
at
cut
and
thrust
and
the
as
i
had
seen
for
myself
at
hare
street
on
the
summer
evenings
i
had
found
him
always
discreet
and
silent
though
i
had
not
as
yet
given
him
any
great
confidence
james
i
said
to
him
with
great
solemnity
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
which
must
go
no
further
he
stood
waiting
on
my
word
a
fellow
hath
been
after
me
named
dangerfield
a
very
brown
man
with
no
hair
on
his
face
for
so
chiffinch
had
told
me
he
hath
been
branded
on
the
hand
for
some
conviction
i
tell
you
this
that
you
may
know
him
if
you
see
him
again
i
take
him
to
be
a
protestant
spy
but
i
do
not
know
for
certain
he
still
stood
waiting
he
knew
very
well
i
think
that
i
was
on
some
business
and
that
therefore
i
was
in
some
danger
too
at
such
a
time
though
i
had
never
spoken
to
him
of
it
and
another
thing
that
i
have
to
say
to
you
is
that
we
must
ride
for
hare
street
and
arrive
there
by
night
without
lying
anywhere
on
the
road
you
must
have
the
horses
here
and
all
ready
by
seven
in
the
morning
and
you
must
tell
no
one
where
we
are
going
to
to
hinder
any
from
following
us
if
we
can
help
it
we
must
lie
at
hare
street
a
good
while
and
the
third
thing
i
have
to
say
is
this
that
you
must
watch
out
very
shrewdly
for
any
signs
that
we
are
known
or
suspected
of
anything
i
tell
you
plainly
that
both
you
and
i
may
be
in
some
danger
for
a
while
so
if
you
have
no
taste
for
that
you
had
best
begone
you
will
keep
quiet
i
know
very
well
sir
i
will
stay
with
you
if
you
please
said
james
as
the
last
word
was
out
of
my
mouth
i
gave
him
a
look
of
pleasure
but
no
more
and
he
understood
me
very
well
then
that
is
all
that
i
have
to
say
you
may
bring
supper
in
as
soon
as
you
like
before
i
lay
down
that
night
i
had
transferred
his
majesty
packet
to
a
belt
that
i
put
next
to
my
skin
and
so
i
went
to
bed
it
was
still
pretty
dark
when
we
came
out
upon
the
ware
road
upon
the
next
morning
i
did
not
call
james
up
to
ride
with
me
for
i
had
a
great
number
of
things
to
think
about
and
first
amongst
them
was
the
commission
which
his
majesty
had
given
me
what
then
could
such
a
business
be
a
packet
that
i
must
carry
with
me
and
deliver
to
a
man
whose
name
should
be
given
me
afterwards
why
then
was
it
entrusted
to
me
so
soon
and
why
could
not
the
name
be
given
to
me
immediately
but
to
such
riddles
there
was
no
answer
and
i
left
it
presently
alone
the
second
thing
that
i
had
to
think
of
was
the
matter
of
the
men
whom
i
had
seen
condemned
yesterday
and
even
of
that
i
did
not
know
much
more
than
of
the
packet
his
majesty
had
not
spoken
of
them
except
to
ask
questions
at
the
beginning
and
this
seemed
as
a
bad
omen
to
me
yet
i
had
the
king
word
on
it
that
they
should
not
suffer
and
when
i
considered
there
was
no
obligation
or
even
any
reason
at
all
that
he
should
talk
out
the
matter
with
myself
yet
though
i
presently
put
this
affair
too
from
my
mind
since
i
had
no
certain
knowledge
of
what
would
happen
it
came
back
to
me
again
and
again
that
memory
of
ireland
and
grove
in
the
lodgings
in
drury
lane
so
harmless
and
so
merry
and
again
as
i
had
seen
them
yesterday
in
the
dock
with
pickering
so
helpless
and
yet
so
courageous
in
face
of
the
injustice
that
was
being
done
on
them
the
third
thing
that
i
had
to
think
upon
was
hare
street
to
which
i
was
going
as
fast
as
i
could
and
of
those
who
would
greet
me
there
and
most
of
all
i
need
not
say
of
my
cousin
dolly
her
father
had
written
to
me
two
or
three
times
during
the
four
months
that
i
had
been
away
and
his
last
had
been
the
letter
of
a
very
much
frightened
man
what
with
the
news
that
had
come
to
him
of
the
proceedings
in
london
and
the
feeling
against
the
catholics
but
i
had
written
back
to
him
that
nothing
was
to
be
feared
if
he
would
but
stay
still
and
hold
his
tongue
and
that
i
myself
would
be
with
him
presently
i
hoped
and
would
reassure
him
for
in
spite
of
the
hot
feeling
in
london
the
country
catholics
suffered
from
it
little
or
not
at
all
so
long
as
they
minded
their
own
business
but
it
was
principally
of
my
cousin
dolly
that
i
thought
for
the
memory
of
her
had
been
with
me
a
great
deal
during
the
four
months
i
had
lived
in
london
but
i
was
determined
to
do
nothing
in
a
hurry
since
the
remembrance
of
her
father
words
to
me
and
even
more
of
his
manner
and
look
in
speaking
stuck
in
my
throat
and
hindered
me
from
seeing
clearly
i
knew
very
well
however
that
my
principal
reason
why
i
urged
peter
on
over
the
bad
roads
was
that
i
might
see
her
the
more
quickly
nothing
of
any
importance
happened
to
us
on
the
way
at
hoddesdon
the
memory
of
rumbald
came
back
to
my
mind
and
i
wondered
where
it
was
in
hoddesdon
or
near
it
that
he
had
his
and
before
that
we
stayed
again
for
dinner
at
the
in
waltham
cross
where
the
host
knew
me
again
and
asked
how
matters
were
in
london
and
we
came
at
last
in
sight
of
the
old
church
at
hormead
parva
just
as
the
sun
was
going
down
upon
our
left
peter
my
horse
knew
where
he
was
then
and
needed
no
more
urging
for
he
knew
that
his
stable
was
not
far
away
they
knew
of
course
nothing
of
my
coming
and
when
i
dismounted
in
the
yard
there
was
not
a
man
to
be
seen
i
left
my
horse
with
james
and
went
along
the
flagged
path
that
led
to
the
door
and
beat
upon
the
door
the
house
seemed
all
dark
and
deserted
and
it
was
not
till
i
had
beaten
once
more
at
the
door
that
i
saw
a
light
shewing
beneath
it
presently
a
very
unsteady
voice
cried
out
to
know
who
was
there
and
i
knew
it
for
my
cousin
tom
so
i
roared
at
him
that
it
was
myself
there
followed
a
great
of
unlocking
and
unbarring
for
they
had
the
house
as
i
found
presently
fortified
as
it
were
a
castle
and
when
the
door
was
undone
there
was
my
cousin
tom
with
a
great
blunderbuss
and
two
men
with
swords
behind
him
why
whatever
is
forward
i
said
sharply
for
i
was
impatient
with
the
long
waiting
and
the
cold
for
a
frost
was
beginning
as
the
sun
set
why
cousin
roger
we
knew
nothing
of
your
coming
said
my
cousin
tom
looking
a
little
foolish
i
thought
we
did
not
know
who
was
at
the
door
i
only
knew
myself
of
my
coming
yesterday
i
said
and
whatever
is
the
house
fortified
for
my
cousin
was
putting
up
the
bolts
again
as
i
spoke
the
two
men
were
gone
away
into
the
back
of
the
house
and
as
soon
as
he
had
done
he
said
why
there
are
dangerous
folks
about
cousin
roger
and
it
is
a
catholic
house
you
see
i
smiled
at
that
but
said
no
more
for
at
that
moment
my
cousin
dolly
came
through
from
the
back
of
the
house
where
she
had
been
sent
by
her
father
for
safety
and
at
that
sight
i
thought
no
more
of
the
door
i
saluted
her
as
a
cousin
should
and
she
me
she
looked
mighty
pretty
to
me
in
her
dark
dress
with
her
lace
on
for
supper
was
just
on
the
table
and
i
can
not
but
think
she
was
pleased
to
see
me
for
she
was
all
smiling
and
flushed
so
it
is
you
cousin
roger
she
said
i
thought
it
might
very
well
be
we
looked
for
you
before
christmas
at
supper
and
afterwards
i
learned
in
what
a
panic
poor
cousin
tom
had
lived
since
the
news
of
the
plot
and
above
all
of
sir
edmund
berry
godfrey
death
and
what
he
said
to
me
made
me
determine
to
speak
to
him
of
my
own
small
peril
for
he
had
the
right
to
know
and
to
forbid
me
his
house
if
he
wished
but
i
hoped
that
he
would
not
it
appeared
that
when
the
news
of
sir
edmund
death
had
come
there
had
been
something
of
a
in
the
village
of
no
great
signification
for
it
was
no
more
than
a
few
young
men
who
marched
up
and
down
shouting
together
as
such
yokels
will
upon
the
smallest
excuse
and
one
of
them
had
cried
out
at
the
gate
of
hare
street
house
at
barkway
there
had
been
more
of
a
business
for
there
they
had
burnt
an
effigy
of
the
pope
in
the
churchyard
and
the
parson
who
was
a
stout
churchman
had
made
a
speech
upon
it
however
this
had
played
upon
cousin
tom
fears
and
he
had
fortified
the
house
with
bolts
and
slept
with
a
pistol
by
his
bed
i
told
him
that
same
night
not
indeed
all
that
happened
to
me
but
enough
of
it
to
satisfy
him
i
said
that
i
had
been
a
good
deal
at
the
jesuits
lodgings
and
at
the
trial
of
the
three
and
that
a
fellow
had
attempted
to
follow
me
home
but
that
i
had
thrown
him
off
cousin
tom
had
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
was
holding
it
in
his
hand
by
the
time
i
had
done
now
cousin
i
said
if
you
think
i
am
anything
of
a
danger
to
the
house
you
have
but
to
say
the
word
and
i
will
be
off
on
the
other
hand
i
and
my
man
might
be
of
some
small
service
to
you
if
it
came
to
a
brawl
you
threw
him
off
asked
cousin
tom
it
was
at
whitehall
i
began
and
then
i
stopped
for
i
had
not
intended
to
speak
of
the
king
oho
said
cousin
tom
then
you
have
been
at
whitehall
again
why
yes
i
said
trying
to
pass
it
off
i
have
been
there
and
everywhere
cousin
tom
put
the
pipe
back
again
into
his
mouth
and
there
is
another
matter
i
said
for
hare
street
suited
me
very
well
as
a
lodging
and
i
had
named
it
as
such
to
his
majesty
it
is
not
right
cousin
tom
that
you
should
keep
me
here
for
nothing
let
me
pay
something
each
month
and
i
named
a
suitable
sum
that
determined
cousin
tom
altogether
my
speaking
of
whitehall
had
greatly
reassured
him
and
now
this
offer
of
mine
made
up
his
mind
for
he
was
something
of
a
skinflint
in
some
respects
for
all
that
i
did
for
him
when
i
was
here
in
the
fields
and
at
the
farm
more
than
repaid
him
for
the
expense
of
my
living
there
he
protested
a
little
and
said
that
between
kinsfolk
no
such
question
should
enter
in
but
he
protested
with
a
very
poor
grace
and
so
the
matter
was
settled
and
we
both
satisfied
so
once
more
the
time
began
to
pass
very
agreeably
for
me
here
was
i
safe
from
all
the
embroilments
of
town
in
the
same
house
with
my
cousin
dorothy
and
with
plenty
of
leisure
for
my
languages
again
yet
my
satisfaction
was
greatly
broken
up
when
i
heard
on
the
last
day
of
january
that
all
that
i
had
feared
was
come
about
and
that
of
the
three
men
whom
i
had
seen
condemned
at
the
old
bailey
two
ireland
and
grove
had
been
executed
seven
days
before
pickering
was
kept
back
on
some
excuse
and
not
put
to
death
until
may
the
way
i
heard
of
it
was
in
this
manner
i
was
in
puckeridge
one
day
on
a
matter
which
i
do
not
now
remember
and
was
going
to
the
stable
of
the
inn
to
get
my
horse
to
ride
back
again
when
i
ran
into
rumbald
who
was
there
on
the
same
errand
i
was
in
my
country
suit
and
very
much
splashed
and
it
was
going
on
for
evening
so
he
noticed
nothing
of
me
but
my
face
why
mallock
he
cried
it
is
mallock
is
it
not
i
told
him
yes
he
exchanged
a
few
words
with
me
for
he
was
one
of
those
fellows
who
when
they
have
once
made
up
their
minds
to
a
thing
do
not
easily
change
it
and
he
was
persuaded
that
i
was
of
his
kind
and
something
of
a
daredevil
too
which
was
what
he
liked
then
at
the
end
he
said
something
which
made
me
question
him
as
to
what
he
meant
have
you
not
heard
he
cried
why
the
popish
dogs
were
hanged
a
week
ago
ireland
and
grove
i
mean
and
there
be
three
or
four
more
men
accused
by
bedloe
of
godfrey
murder
and
will
be
tried
presently
i
need
not
say
what
a
horror
it
was
to
me
to
hear
that
for
i
had
had
more
hope
in
my
heart
than
i
had
thought
but
i
was
collected
enough
to
say
something
that
satisfied
him
and
as
again
he
had
been
drinking
he
was
not
very
quick
and
those
three
or
four
i
asked
are
they
jesuits
too
no
said
rumbald
but
there
will
be
another
batch
presently
i
make
no
doubt
i
got
rid
of
him
at
last
and
rode
homewards
but
it
was
with
a
very
heavy
heart
not
once
yet
had
the
king
exercised
his
prerogative
of
mercy
and
if
he
yielded
at
the
first
and
that
against
the
jesuits
whom
he
had
sworn
to
protect
was
there
anything
in
which
he
would
resist
my
cousin
dorothy
saw
in
my
face
as
i
came
in
that
something
was
the
matter
so
i
told
her
the
truth
may
they
rest
in
peace
she
said
and
blessed
herself
from
time
to
time
news
reached
us
in
this
kind
of
manner
though
we
were
not
a
great
distance
from
london
we
were
in
a
very
solitary
place
away
from
the
that
ran
to
cambridge
and
few
came
our
way
even
in
puckeridge
it
was
not
known
i
think
who
i
was
nor
that
i
was
cousin
to
jermyn
so
i
had
no
fear
of
rumbald
suspecting
me
green
berry
and
hill
were
all
convicted
of
sir
edmund
murder
through
the
testimony
of
bedloe
who
said
that
he
had
himself
seen
the
body
at
somerset
house
and
that
sir
edmund
had
been
strangled
there
by
priests
and
others
and
conveyed
later
to
the
ditch
in
primrose
hill
where
he
was
found
another
fellow
too
named
miles
prance
a
silversmith
in
princes
street
out
of
drury
lane
who
was
said
by
bedloe
to
have
been
privy
to
the
murder
in
the
fear
of
his
life
and
after
inhuman
treatment
in
prison
did
corroborate
the
story
and
add
to
it
under
promise
of
pardon
which
he
got
green
berry
and
hill
then
were
hanged
on
the
tenth
day
of
february
on
the
testimonies
of
these
two
and
were
as
innocent
as
unborn
babes
it
was
remarked
how
strangely
their
names
went
with
the
name
of
the
murdered
man
and
of
the
place
he
was
found
in
for
a
while
after
that
matters
were
more
quiet
a
man
named
samuel
atkins
was
tried
presently
but
was
acquitted
and
then
a
nathaniel
reading
was
tried
for
suppressing
evidence
and
was
punished
for
it
but
our
minds
rather
were
fixed
upon
the
approaching
trial
of
the
five
jesuits
as
they
were
called
who
still
awaited
it
in
prison
whitbread
fenwick
harcourt
gavan
and
turner
all
priests
but
i
had
not
a
great
deal
of
hope
for
these
when
i
thought
of
what
had
happened
to
the
rest
and
indeed
at
the
end
of
may
pickering
himself
was
executed
at
the
beginning
of
may
too
we
heard
of
the
bloody
murder
of
sharpe
the
protestant
archbishop
in
scotland
by
the
old
covenanters
driven
mad
by
the
persecution
this
man
had
put
them
to
but
this
did
not
greatly
affect
our
fortunes
either
way
one
of
the
most
bitter
thoughts
of
all
was
that
a
secular
priest
named
serjeant
who
with
another
named
morris
was
of
gallican
views
had
given
evidence
in
public
court
against
the
jesuits
casuistry
meanwhile
in
other
matters
we
were
quiet
enough
still
i
hesitated
in
pushing
my
suit
with
my
cousin
dolly
until
i
could
see
whether
she
was
being
forced
to
it
or
not
but
my
cousin
tom
had
more
wits
than
i
had
thought
for
he
said
no
more
to
me
on
the
point
nor
i
to
him
and
i
think
i
should
have
spoken
to
her
that
summer
had
not
an
interruption
come
to
my
plans
that
set
all
aside
for
the
present
during
those
months
of
spring
and
early
summer
we
had
no
religious
consolation
at
all
for
we
were
too
near
london
and
at
the
same
time
too
solitary
for
any
priest
to
come
to
us
the
interruption
came
in
this
manner
i
had
sent
my
man
over
to
waltham
cross
on
an
affair
of
a
horse
that
was
to
be
sold
there
on
the
nineteenth
day
of
june
as
i
very
well
remember
from
what
happened
afterwards
and
when
he
came
back
he
asked
if
he
might
speak
with
me
privately
when
i
had
him
alone
in
my
room
he
told
me
he
had
news
from
a
catholic
ostler
at
the
with
whom
he
had
spoken
that
a
party
had
been
asking
after
me
there
that
very
morning
i
said
to
him
sir
what
kind
of
a
party
was
it
and
he
told
me
that
there
were
four
men
and
that
they
went
in
to
drink
first
and
to
dine
for
they
came
there
about
noon
i
asked
him
then
if
any
of
them
had
any
mark
by
which
he
could
be
known
and
he
laughed
at
that
and
said
that
one
of
them
was
branded
in
the
hand
for
he
was
pulling
his
glove
on
when
he
came
into
the
yard
afterwards
so
that
it
was
seen
i
said
nothing
for
a
moment
when
james
said
that
for
i
was
considering
whether
so
small
a
business
of
so
many
months
ago
was
worth
thinking
of
and
what
then
i
said
well
sir
as
i
was
riding
back
i
kept
my
eyes
about
me
and
especially
in
the
villages
where
it
might
be
easy
to
miss
them
and
in
puckeridge
as
i
came
by
the
inn
i
looked
into
the
yard
and
saw
there
four
horses
all
tied
up
together
did
you
ask
after
them
i
said
no
sir
i
thought
it
best
not
but
i
pushed
on
as
quickly
as
i
could
did
the
ostler
at
waltham
cross
tell
you
what
answer
was
given
to
the
inquiries
no
sir
he
heard
your
name
only
from
the
parlour
window
as
he
went
through
the
yard
now
here
was
i
in
a
quandary
on
the
one
hand
this
was
a
very
small
affair
and
not
much
evidence
either
way
and
i
did
not
wish
to
alarm
my
cousin
tom
if
i
need
not
and
on
the
other
if
they
were
after
me
i
had
best
be
gone
as
soon
as
i
could
it
was
six
months
since
the
fellow
dangerfield
had
asked
after
me
at
whitehall
and
no
harm
had
followed
yet
here
was
the
tale
of
the
branded
hand
and
although
there
were
many
branded
hands
in
england
the
consonance
of
this
with
what
had
happened
misliked
me
a
little
and
was
there
any
more
news
i
asked
why
yes
sir
i
had
forgot
the
man
told
me
too
that
the
five
jesuits
were
cast
six
days
ago
and
langhorn
a
day
later
and
that
they
were
all
sentenced
together
langhorn
was
a
lawyer
a
very
hot
and
devout
catholic
but
his
wife
was
as
hot
a
protestant
now
on
hearing
that
i
was
a
little
more
perturbed
here
were
whitbread
and
fenwick
in
whose
company
i
had
often
been
seen
in
public
before
the
late
troubles
condemned
and
awaiting
sentence
and
here
was
a
fellow
with
a
branded
hand
asking
after
me
in
waltham
cross
oates
and
bedloe
and
tonge
and
kirby
and
a
score
of
others
were
evidence
that
any
man
who
sought
his
fortune
might
very
well
do
so
in
popish
plots
and
accusations
and
it
was
quite
believable
that
dangerfield
was
one
more
of
them
and
that
after
these
new
events
he
was
after
me
yet
still
i
did
not
wish
to
alarm
my
cousin
tom
for
he
was
a
man
who
could
not
hide
his
feelings
i
thought
it
was
growing
dark
now
for
it
was
after
nine
and
cloudy
with
no
moon
to
rise
and
all
would
soon
be
gone
to
bed
so
what
i
did
i
must
do
at
once
i
sat
still
in
my
chair
thinking
that
if
i
were
hunted
out
of
hare
street
i
had
nowhere
to
go
and
then
on
a
sudden
i
remembered
the
king
packet
which
he
had
given
me
and
which
i
still
carried
as
always
wrapped
in
next
to
my
skin
since
no
word
had
come
from
him
as
to
what
i
was
to
do
with
it
and
at
that
remembrance
i
determined
that
i
must
undergo
no
risks
james
i
said
i
think
that
we
must
be
ready
to
go
away
if
we
are
threatened
in
any
way
go
down
to
the
stables
and
saddle
a
fresh
horse
for
you
and
my
own
then
come
up
here
again
and
pack
a
pair
of
valises
i
do
not
know
as
yet
whether
we
must
go
or
not
but
we
must
be
ready
for
it
then
take
the
valises
and
the
horses
down
to
the
meadow
through
the
garden
and
tie
all
up
there
under
the
shadow
of
the
trees
from
where
you
can
see
the
house
and
you
must
remain
there
yourself
till
twelve
at
twelve
as
near
as
i
can
tell
it
if
all
is
quiet
i
will
show
a
light
three
times
from
the
garret
window
and
when
you
see
that
you
can
come
back
again
and
go
to
bed
if
they
are
after
us
at
all
they
will
come
when
they
think
we
are
all
asleep
and
it
will
be
before
twelve
do
you
understand
it
all
i
was
very
glib
in
all
this
for
i
had
thought
it
out
all
beforehand
if
ever
there
should
be
an
alarm
of
this
kind
my
man
said
that
he
understood
very
well
and
went
away
and
i
down
to
the
great
chamber
where
i
had
left
my
cousins
as
i
came
in
at
the
door
my
cousin
tom
woke
up
with
a
great
snuffle
and
stared
at
me
as
if
amazed
as
folks
do
when
suddenly
awakened
well
to
bed
he
said
i
am
half
there
already
my
cousin
dorothy
looked
up
from
her
sewing
and
i
think
she
knew
that
something
was
forward
for
she
continued
to
look
at
me
not
to
bed
yet
cousin
tom
i
said
there
is
a
matter
i
must
speak
of
first
well
i
sat
down
and
told
him
as
gently
as
i
could
all
the
affair
except
of
the
king
packet
and
by
the
time
i
was
done
he
was
no
longer
at
all
drowsy
i
told
him
too
of
the
design
i
had
formed
and
that
james
was
gone
to
carry
it
out
had
you
not
best
be
gone
at
once
he
said
and
i
saw
the
terror
in
his
eyes
lest
he
too
should
be
embroiled
but
my
cousin
dorothy
looked
at
me
unafraid
only
there
was
a
spot
of
colour
on
either
cheek
well
i
said
i
can
ride
out
into
the
fields
and
wait
there
if
you
wish
it
until
morning
if
you
will
send
for
me
then
if
all
be
quiet
but
i
explained
to
him
again
that
i
was
in
two
minds
as
to
whether
i
should
go
at
all
so
very
small
was
the
evidence
of
danger
he
looked
foolish
at
that
but
i
could
see
that
he
wanted
me
gone
so
i
stood
up
well
cousin
i
said
i
see
that
you
will
be
easier
if
i
go
i
will
begone
first
and
see
whether
james
has
the
horses
out
and
you
had
best
meanwhile
go
to
my
chamber
and
put
away
all
that
can
incriminate
you
in
one
of
your
i
was
to
the
kitchen
when
i
heard
my
cousin
dorothy
come
after
me
and
i
could
see
that
she
was
in
a
great
way
cousin
she
said
i
am
ashamed
that
my
father
should
speak
like
that
if
i
were
mistress
my
dear
cousin
i
said
lightly
if
you
were
mistress
i
should
not
be
here
at
all
it
is
a
shame
she
said
again
paying
no
attention
as
her
way
was
when
she
liked
it
is
a
shame
that
you
should
spend
all
night
in
the
fields
for
nothing
as
she
was
speaking
i
heard
james
come
downstairs
with
the
valises
as
he
went
past
he
told
me
he
already
had
the
horses
tied
under
the
trees
i
nodded
to
him
and
bade
him
go
on
and
he
went
out
into
the
yard
and
so
through
the
stables
i
had
best
go
help
your
father
put
the
things
away
i
said
they
will
not
be
here
at
any
rate
until
the
lights
of
the
house
are
all
out
we
went
upstairs
together
and
found
my
cousin
tom
already
busy
he
had
my
clothes
all
in
a
great
heap
ready
to
carry
down
to
the
above
the
door
my
papers
he
already
had
put
away
into
the
little
recess
behind
the
bed
and
the
books
most
of
which
had
not
my
name
in
them
he
designed
to
carry
to
his
own
chamber
we
worked
hard
at
all
this
my
cousin
tom
in
a
kind
of
fever
rolling
his
eyes
at
every
sound
and
at
the
last
we
had
all
put
away
and
were
about
to
close
the
door
of
the
then
my
cousin
dorothy
held
up
her
hand
hush
she
said
and
then
there
was
a
step
on
the
paved
walk
chapter
ix
when
my
cousin
dorothy
said
that
we
all
became
upon
the
instant
as
still
as
mice
and
i
saw
my
cousin
tom
mouth
suddenly
hang
open
and
his
eyes
to
become
fixed
for
myself
i
can
not
say
precisely
what
i
felt
but
it
would
be
foolish
to
say
that
i
was
not
at
all
frightened
for
to
be
crept
upon
in
the
dark
when
all
is
quiet
in
a
solitary
country
place
and
to
know
as
i
did
that
behind
all
the
silence
there
is
the
roar
of
a
mob
as
it
is
called
for
blood
and
the
lord
chief
justice
face
of
iron
and
his
bitter
murderous
tongue
and
the
scaffold
and
the
knife
this
is
daunting
to
any
man
i
made
no
mistake
upon
the
matter
if
this
were
dangerfield
himself
my
life
was
ended
he
would
not
have
come
here
so
far
and
with
such
caution
he
would
not
have
been
at
the
pains
to
smell
me
out
at
all
unless
he
were
sure
of
his
end
and
indeed
my
companying
so
much
with
the
jesuits
and
my
encounter
with
oates
and
my
seeking
service
with
the
king
and
for
no
pay
too
all
this
in
such
days
was
evidence
enough
to
hang
an
angel
from
heaven
this
passed
through
my
mind
like
a
picture
and
then
i
remembered
that
it
was
no
more
than
a
step
on
a
paved
path
if
it
is
they
i
whispered
they
will
be
round
the
house
by
now
we
had
best
look
from
a
dark
window
but
my
cousin
tom
seized
me
suddenly
by
the
arm
in
so
fierce
a
grip
that
i
winced
and
all
but
cried
out
and
so
we
stood
if
you
have
brought
ruin
on
me
he
began
presently
in
a
horrid
kind
of
whisper
and
then
he
gripped
me
again
for
again
so
that
no
man
could
mistake
it
came
a
single
step
on
the
paved
path
and
in
my
mind
i
saw
how
two
men
had
crossed
from
lawn
to
lawn
to
get
all
round
the
house
each
stepping
once
upon
the
stones
they
must
have
entered
from
the
yard
in
those
moments
there
came
to
me
too
a
knowledge
of
the
truth
of
which
i
neither
had
nor
have
any
doubt
at
all
that
my
cousin
tom
was
considering
whether
he
might
save
himself
or
no
by
handing
me
forthwith
to
the
searchers
but
i
suppose
he
thought
not
for
presently
his
hand
relaxed
in
with
you
he
whispered
and
made
a
back
for
me
to
climb
up
into
the
i
looked
at
my
cousin
dolly
and
she
nodded
at
me
ever
so
gently
so
i
set
my
foot
on
my
cousin
tom
broad
back
and
my
hands
to
the
ledge
and
raised
myself
up
it
was
a
pretty
wide
space
within
sufficient
to
hold
three
or
four
men
though
my
clothes
and
a
few
books
covered
most
of
the
floor
but
the
only
light
i
had
was
from
the
candle
that
my
cousin
dolly
carried
in
her
hand
as
i
turned
to
the
door
again
i
caught
a
sight
of
her
face
very
pretty
and
very
pale
looking
up
at
me
i
remember
even
now
the
shadow
on
her
eyes
and
beneath
her
hair
and
then
the
door
was
put
to
quickly
and
i
was
all
in
the
dark
it
was
a
very
strange
experience
to
lie
there
and
to
hear
all
that
went
on
in
the
house
scarcely
a
away
i
lay
there
i
should
think
ten
minutes
or
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
the
assault
was
made
and
during
that
time
too
i
could
tell
pretty
well
all
that
went
on
there
remained
for
a
minute
or
thereabouts
a
line
of
light
upon
the
roof
of
my
little
chamber
from
the
candle
that
my
cousin
dolly
carried
and
that
line
of
light
was
as
a
star
to
me
then
i
heard
a
little
whispering
the
light
went
out
and
i
heard
soft
steps
going
upstairs
then
i
heard
first
the
door
of
my
cousin
dolly
chamber
close
and
then
another
door
which
was
my
cousin
tom
then
followed
complete
silence
and
i
knew
that
the
two
would
go
to
bed
and
be
found
there
as
if
ignorant
of
everything
the
assault
was
made
on
two
doors
at
once
at
front
and
back
they
had
another
man
or
two
i
have
no
doubt
in
the
and
more
beneath
the
windows
everywhere
so
that
i
could
not
escape
any
way
there
came
on
a
sudden
loud
hammerings
and
voices
shouting
altogether
but
i
could
not
tell
what
it
was
that
they
cried
but
i
suppose
it
must
have
been
open
in
the
king
name
then
the
house
awakened
all
that
is
that
were
asleep
and
the
rest
feigned
to
do
so
i
heard
steps
run
down
the
stairs
and
voices
everywhere
as
the
maids
over
the
kitchen
awakened
and
screamed
as
maids
will
and
the
men
awakened
and
ran
down
from
the
garret
then
overhead
across
the
lobby
i
heard
my
cousin
tom
footsteps
and
i
nearly
laughed
to
myself
at
the
thought
of
the
part
that
he
must
play
and
of
how
ill
he
would
play
it
and
all
the
while
the
beating
on
the
doors
went
on
and
i
heard
voices
through
the
lath
and
plaster
from
the
and
then
the
sound
of
unbolting
and
the
knocking
ceased
on
that
side
though
it
still
went
on
upon
the
other
my
as
i
have
said
was
in
the
very
centre
of
the
house
one
side
faced
upon
the
and
the
opposite
down
the
front
passage
and
of
the
other
two
one
upon
the
stairs
and
one
upon
the
kitchen
passage
and
these
two
had
the
doors
in
them
above
me
was
the
lobby
and
beneath
me
first
the
little
way
into
the
and
beneath
that
the
cellars
it
was
strange
how
prominent
the
place
was
and
yet
how
well
concealed
one
might
live
ten
years
in
the
house
without
suspecting
its
presence
presently
the
whole
house
was
full
of
talking
and
the
front
door
was
opened
and
i
heard
a
gentleman
voice
speaking
he
was
harris
i
learned
afterwards
a
justice
of
the
peace
from
puckeridge
whom
dangerfield
had
brought
with
him
much
of
what
was
said
i
could
not
hear
but
i
heard
enough
to
understand
why
i
was
being
looked
for
and
what
would
be
the
charges
against
me
now
the
voices
came
muffled
and
now
clear
so
that
i
would
hear
half
a
sentence
and
no
more
as
the
speaker
moved
on
i
tell
you
he
left
for
rome
i
heard
my
cousin
tom
say
which
was
an
adroit
lie
indeed
as
no
one
could
tell
whether
i
had
or
no
and
he
hath
taken
his
man
with
him
that
is
very
well
began
the
gentleman
voice
and
then
no
more
presently
i
heard
one
of
the
men
of
the
house
named
dick
a
good
friend
of
mine
ask
what
they
were
after
me
for
and
some
fellow
as
he
went
by
answered
consorting
with
the
jesuits
and
conspiring
and
no
more
so
then
i
lay
and
listened
much
that
i
heard
had
no
relevance
at
all
for
it
was
the
protesting
of
maids
and
the
footsteps
went
continually
up
and
down
sometimes
voices
rose
in
anger
sometimes
it
was
only
a
whisper
that
went
by
i
heard
presses
open
and
shut
and
once
or
twice
the
noise
of
hammering
overhead
and
then
silence
again
but
no
silence
was
for
long
here
again
i
find
it
very
hard
to
say
all
that
i
felt
during
that
search
my
thoughts
came
and
went
like
pictures
upon
the
dark
now
my
heart
would
so
beat
that
it
sickened
me
of
sheer
terror
that
i
should
be
found
and
this
especially
when
a
man
would
stay
for
a
while
talking
on
the
stairs
within
an
arm
length
of
where
i
lay
now
it
was
as
i
might
say
more
of
the
intellect
and
i
pondered
on
what
i
heard
my
cousin
tom
say
and
marvelled
at
his
shrewdness
for
fear
if
it
does
not
drive
away
wits
sharpens
them
wonderfully
he
had
of
course
put
me
in
greater
peril
by
saying
that
i
was
gone
to
rome
but
he
had
saved
himself
very
adroitly
for
no
witness
in
the
house
could
tell
that
i
had
not
done
so
for
here
was
my
chamber
empty
and
i
and
my
man
and
my
clothes
and
my
books
and
my
horses
all
vanished
away
at
one
time
then
i
was
all
eyes
and
ears
in
the
muffled
dark
hearing
my
heart
thump
as
it
had
been
another
at
another
time
i
would
be
looking
within
and
contemplating
my
own
fear
again
and
again
however
i
thought
of
my
cousin
dorothy
and
wondered
where
she
was
and
what
she
was
at
i
had
not
heard
her
voice
all
that
time
and
on
a
sudden
after
the
men
had
been
in
the
house
near
an
hour
i
should
say
i
heard
her
sob
suddenly
close
to
me
in
a
terrified
kind
of
voice
keep
them
nancy
keep
them
here
as
long
as
you
can
it
will
give
him
eh
said
a
man
voice
suddenly
beneath
what
was
that
i
said
nothing
stammered
my
cousin
dolly
voice
well
there
was
a
the
fellow
beneath
called
out
to
harris
who
was
upstairs
and
i
heard
him
come
down
my
cousin
dolly
was
sobbing
and
crying
out
and
so
was
the
maid
nancy
to
whom
she
had
spoken
at
first
i
could
make
nothing
of
it
nor
why
she
had
said
what
she
had
and
then
as
i
heard
them
all
go
into
the
parlour
together
i
understood
that
if
my
cousin
tom
had
been
shrewd
his
daughter
had
been
shrewder
and
had
said
what
she
had
knowing
that
a
man
was
within
earshot
but
there
was
nothing
for
me
to
do
but
to
lie
there
still
for
i
could
hear
nothing
from
the
parlour
but
a
confused
sound
of
voices
now
three
or
four
speaking
at
once
now
a
man
voice
which
i
took
to
be
the
magistrate
and
now
i
thought
my
cousin
dolly
i
heard
too
above
me
my
cousin
tom
speaking
very
angrily
and
understood
that
he
was
kept
from
his
daughter
which
was
the
best
thing
in
the
world
for
me
since
he
might
very
well
have
spoiled
the
whole
design
at
last
i
heard
dolly
cry
out
very
loud
then
i
heard
the
open
and
three
or
four
men
came
tumbling
out
who
ran
beneath
my
and
out
through
the
kitchen
passage
to
the
stable
i
was
all
now
especially
at
my
cousin
cry
but
i
gave
her
credit
for
being
as
shrewd
still
as
i
had
heard
her
to
be
on
the
stairs
and
i
proved
right
in
the
event
for
almost
immediately
after
that
my
cousin
tom
was
let
come
downstairs
and
i
heard
every
word
of
the
colloquy
well
jermyn
said
the
gentleman
voice
immediately
without
my
little
door
i
am
sorry
indeed
to
have
troubled
you
in
this
way
but
i
am
the
king
justice
of
the
peace
and
i
must
do
my
duty
which
way
did
you
say
mallock
was
gone
by
by
puckeridge
stammered
poor
tom
ah
indeed
said
the
other
voice
with
something
of
a
sneer
in
it
why
mistress
dorothy
here
says
it
was
by
barkway
and
so
to
harwich
and
of
the
two
versions
i
prefer
the
lady
for
first
we
should
have
seen
him
if
he
had
come
by
puckeridge
since
we
have
been
lying
there
since
three
this
afternoon
and
second
no
such
man
in
his
senses
would
go
to
rome
by
london
i
am
sorry
i
can
not
commend
your
truthfulness
jermyn
as
much
as
your
professions
of
loyalty
i
tell
you
began
my
cousin
tom
angrily
enough
i
need
no
telling
jermyn
your
cousin
is
gone
by
barkway
and
my
men
are
gone
to
get
the
horses
out
to
follow
him
we
shall
catch
him
before
newmarket
i
make
no
doubt
then
i
heard
dolly
sobbing
as
she
clung
to
her
father
oh
father
father
she
mourned
the
gentleman
forced
it
out
of
me
i
could
not
help
it
i
could
not
help
it
as
for
me
i
smiled
near
from
ear
to
ear
in
the
dark
to
hear
how
well
she
feigned
grief
and
i
think
i
loved
my
cousin
dolly
then
as
never
before
it
would
have
made
a
cat
laugh
too
to
hear
the
chivalry
in
return
mistress
dorothy
he
said
i
grieve
to
have
troubled
you
like
this
but
you
have
done
your
duty
as
an
english
maid
should
and
set
your
loyalty
to
his
majesty
before
all
else
mistress
dorothy
sobbed
so
admirably
in
return
that
my
own
eyes
filled
with
tears
to
hear
her
and
i
was
a
little
sorry
for
the
poor
gentleman
too
he
was
so
stupid
and
yet
so
well
mannered
too
now
that
he
had
got
all
that
he
wanted
or
thought
he
had
well
mistress
and
jermyn
i
must
not
delay
any
longer
the
horses
will
be
ready
they
moved
away
still
talking
all
except
my
cousin
dolly
who
sank
upon
the
stairs
still
sobbing
she
cried
out
after
harris
to
have
mercy
and
then
fell
again
when
the
door
of
the
kitchen
passage
shut
for
they
were
all
gone
out
by
now
her
crying
ceased
mighty
soon
and
then
i
heard
her
laugh
very
softly
to
herself
and
break
off
again
as
if
she
had
put
her
hand
over
her
mouth
but
i
dared
not
speak
to
her
yet
i
listened
very
carefully
for
all
the
house
was
still
now
for
the
sound
of
the
horses
feet
and
presently
i
heard
them
and
reckoned
that
a
dozen
at
least
must
have
come
after
me
and
i
heard
the
voices
of
the
men
too
as
they
rode
away
grow
faint
and
cease
then
i
heard
my
cousin
dolly
slip
through
the
door
beneath
me
and
she
gave
me
one
little
rap
to
the
floor
of
my
as
she
went
beneath
it
i
did
not
hear
her
come
back
for
cousin
tom
footsteps
were
loud
in
the
kitchen
passage
and
the
men
too
were
tramping
in
and
upstairs
while
the
maids
went
back
to
bed
through
the
kitchen
and
then
when
all
was
quiet
again
i
heard
her
voice
speak
suddenly
in
a
whisper
you
can
open
now
cousin
roger
they
be
all
gone
away
i
unbolted
and
pushed
open
the
little
door
quickly
enough
then
and
though
i
was
dazed
with
the
candlelight
the
first
thing
that
i
saw
was
dolly
face
her
eyes
as
bright
as
stars
with
merriment
and
laughter
and
her
cheeks
flushed
to
rose
looking
up
at
me
chapter
x
that
ride
of
mine
all
night
to
london
was
such
as
i
shall
never
forget
not
from
any
outward
incident
that
happened
but
for
the
thoughts
that
went
continually
through
my
heart
and
brain
and
i
do
not
suppose
that
i
spoke
twenty
words
to
james
all
night
until
we
saw
about
seven
the
smoke
and
spires
of
london
against
the
morning
sky
so
soon
as
the
coast
was
clear
and
the
last
sound
of
the
horses
was
died
away
on
the
hill
beyond
the
castle
inn
for
the
men
rode
fast
and
hard
to
catch
me
i
was
out
and
away
in
the
opposite
direction
to
puckeridge
but
first
we
brought
the
horses
back
as
softly
as
we
could
with
james
who
like
a
good
servant
had
not
stirred
an
inch
from
his
orders
through
all
the
tumult
which
he
had
heard
plainly
enough
from
the
meadow
round
to
the
head
of
the
little
lane
that
leads
from
hormead
magna
into
hare
street
there
we
waited
i
say
all
four
of
us
in
silence
until
we
heard
the
hoofs
no
more
and
then
james
and
i
mounted
on
our
horses
i
had
said
scarcely
a
word
to
dorothy
nor
she
to
me
for
we
both
felt
i
think
that
there
was
no
great
need
of
words
after
such
an
adventure
and
that
it
had
knit
us
closer
together
than
any
words
could
do
and
besides
that
was
no
place
to
talk
yet
it
was
not
all
pure
joy
for
here
was
the
knowledge
which
we
both
had
that
i
must
go
away
and
that
god
only
knew
when
i
should
get
back
again
and
whatever
that
knowledge
was
to
dorothy
it
was
as
a
sword
for
pain
to
me
as
for
my
cousin
tom
he
was
no
better
than
a
dummy
for
he
was
still
terrified
at
all
that
had
happened
and
at
the
magistrate
words
to
him
i
told
them
both
while
we
were
still
in
the
house
that
i
must
go
to
london
partly
for
that
that
was
the
last
place
in
the
world
that
any
would
look
for
me
in
and
partly
but
this
i
told
neither
of
them
for
that
i
must
return
the
packet
to
his
majesty
and
i
said
that
from
london
i
would
go
to
france
for
a
little
until
it
seemed
safe
for
me
to
get
back
again
but
there
waiting
in
the
dark
i
said
nothing
at
all
but
before
i
mounted
i
kissed
dorothy
on
the
cheek
and
her
cheek
was
wet
but
whether
with
the
feigned
tears
she
had
shed
in
the
house
or
with
tears
even
dearer
to
me
than
those
i
do
not
know
but
i
dared
not
delay
any
longer
for
fear
that
when
harris
came
to
barkway
which
was
five
miles
away
he
might
learn
that
no
one
that
could
be
james
and
i
had
passed
that
way
and
so
return
to
search
again
the
clouds
had
rolled
away
by
now
and
it
was
a
clear
night
of
stars
until
they
began
to
pale
about
two
in
the
morning
and
i
think
that
for
a
lover
who
desires
to
be
alone
with
his
thoughts
there
is
no
light
of
sun
or
moon
or
candle
so
sweet
as
the
light
of
stars
and
by
that
time
we
were
beyond
ware
and
coming
out
of
the
valley
it
was
solemn
to
me
to
watch
that
dawn
coming
up
for
it
was
i
thought
the
last
dawn
that
i
should
see
in
england
for
a
while
since
i
was
determined
but
to
see
the
king
in
london
and
push
straight
on
to
dover
and
take
the
packet
there
and
it
was
a
solemn
dawn
too
in
another
way
for
it
was
the
first
i
had
seen
since
i
had
been
certain
not
only
that
i
loved
my
cousin
dolly
as
i
had
my
own
heart
but
that
she
loved
me
also
and
that
is
a
great
day
for
a
lover
to
see
the
king
then
and
to
push
on
to
dover
was
all
that
i
had
rehearsed
to
myself
but
providence
had
one
more
adventure
for
me
first
that
was
one
of
the
saddest
i
have
ever
had
in
all
my
life
and
yet
not
all
sad
my
road
took
me
in
through
the
city
and
down
gracechurch
street
but
here
i
took
a
fancy
to
turn
to
the
right
up
leadenhall
and
cornhill
which
were
all
crowded
with
folks
though
at
first
i
did
not
think
why
that
i
might
go
by
newgate
where
the
jesuits
lay
and
see
at
least
the
walls
that
enclosed
those
saints
of
god
for
i
was
pretty
bold
here
knowing
that
dangerfield
who
was
my
chief
peril
was
off
to
harwich
to
find
me
and
even
if
they
found
that
i
was
not
gone
through
barkway
i
did
not
think
that
they
could
catch
me
for
their
horses
were
tired
and
ours
fresh
and
you
do
not
easily
get
a
change
of
a
dozen
horses
or
anywhere
near
it
in
hertfordshire
villages
so
i
went
very
boldly
and
made
no
pretence
not
to
look
folks
in
the
face
after
we
had
passed
up
cheapside
it
appeared
to
me
that
the
streets
were
strangely
full
and
that
all
the
folk
were
going
the
same
way
and
so
astonished
was
i
at
this
for
no
suspicion
of
the
truth
came
to
me
that
i
bid
my
man
ask
someone
what
the
matter
was
when
he
came
up
with
me
again
i
could
see
that
something
was
the
matter
indeed
and
so
it
was
sir
he
said
in
a
low
voice
so
that
none
else
could
hear
they
are
taking
the
prisoners
to
execution
this
morning
then
there
came
upon
me
a
kind
of
madness
for
although
by
blessing
it
brought
no
harm
to
me
yet
it
was
nothing
else
and
i
determined
to
go
to
newgate
as
i
had
intended
and
at
least
see
them
brought
out
for
here
was
to
be
a
martyrdom
indeed
five
men
all
priests
all
religious
suffering
in
god
eyes
at
least
for
nothing
in
the
world
but
the
catholic
religion
yes
and
in
men
too
if
they
had
known
all
for
i
remembered
how
whitbread
had
refused
to
escape
while
he
had
yet
a
whole
day
for
it
for
fear
of
seeming
to
confess
his
guilt
and
so
bringing
scandal
upon
the
church
and
his
order
from
such
a
martyrdom
then
so
near
to
me
how
could
i
turn
away
and
i
determined
if
i
could
to
speak
with
father
whitbread
and
get
his
blessing
when
i
got
near
newgate
the
press
grew
greater
every
instant
but
as
we
were
on
horseback
and
the
greater
number
of
the
folks
on
foot
we
got
through
them
at
last
and
so
came
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
by
the
chapel
where
the
sleds
were
laid
ready
with
a
pair
of
horses
to
each
i
had
never
before
seen
an
execution
done
in
england
so
i
observed
very
carefully
everything
that
was
to
be
seen
the
sleds
were
three
in
number
and
were
each
made
flat
of
strong
wood
with
runners
about
an
inch
high
and
there
was
a
pair
of
horses
harnessed
to
each
with
a
man
to
guide
them
i
got
close
to
these
next
behind
the
line
of
yellow
trainbandmen
who
kept
the
way
open
as
well
as
the
stairs
we
were
in
the
shadow
here
in
a
little
court
of
which
the
gates
were
set
open
but
the
people
were
all
crowded
in
behind
the
trainbandmen
as
well
as
in
the
street
outside
and
from
them
rose
a
great
murmuring
of
talk
of
which
i
did
not
hear
a
word
spoken
in
sympathy
for
i
suppose
that
the
catholics
there
held
their
tongues
we
had
not
very
long
to
wait
for
by
the
appointment
of
god
i
was
come
just
to
time
and
very
soon
the
door
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
was
opened
and
men
began
to
come
out
i
saw
sheriff
how
among
them
who
was
to
see
execution
done
but
i
did
not
observe
these
very
closely
since
i
was
looking
for
the
jesuits
harcourt
came
first
into
the
sunlight
that
was
at
the
head
of
the
steps
and
at
the
sight
of
him
i
was
moved
very
deeply
for
he
was
an
old
man
with
short
white
hair
very
thick
and
walked
with
a
stick
with
his
other
hand
in
some
fellow
arm
a
great
rustle
of
talk
began
when
he
appeared
and
swelled
into
a
roar
but
he
paid
no
attention
to
it
and
came
down
smiling
and
looking
to
his
steps
next
came
whitbread
and
at
the
sight
of
him
i
was
as
much
affected
as
by
the
old
man
for
i
had
spoken
with
him
so
often
he
too
walked
cheerfully
first
looking
about
him
resolutely
as
he
came
out
at
all
the
faces
turned
up
to
his
and
at
him
too
was
even
a
greater
roaring
for
the
people
thought
him
to
be
at
the
head
of
all
the
conspiracy
he
was
pinioned
loosely
with
cords
but
not
so
that
he
could
not
lift
his
hands
and
so
were
the
other
three
that
followed
and
a
fellow
held
the
other
end
of
the
cord
in
his
hand
turner
and
gavan
who
came
next
i
had
never
seen
before
gavan
was
he
that
was
taken
in
the
stables
of
the
imperial
ambassador
count
wallinstein
they
came
one
behind
the
other
and
paid
no
more
attention
than
the
others
to
the
noise
that
greeted
them
and
last
of
all
came
fenwick
who
had
entertained
me
so
often
in
drury
lane
looking
pinched
i
thought
with
his
imprisonment
yet
as
courageous
as
any
behind
him
came
a
minister
and
then
the
tail
of
the
guard
as
i
saw
fenwick
come
out
i
put
into
execution
a
design
i
had
formed
just
now
and
slipping
from
my
horse
i
got
out
a
guinea
and
begged
in
a
low
voice
the
fellow
before
me
for
i
was
just
by
the
sled
on
which
harcourt
and
whitbread
would
be
bound
to
let
me
through
enough
to
speak
a
word
with
him
and
at
the
same
time
i
pressed
the
guinea
into
his
hand
so
he
stood
aside
a
little
and
let
me
through
on
my
knees
enough
to
speak
to
whitbread
harcourt
was
already
laid
down
on
the
sled
on
the
further
side
from
me
and
whitbread
was
getting
to
his
knees
for
the
same
end
as
he
turned
and
sat
himself
on
the
sled
he
saw
me
and
frowned
ever
so
little
then
he
smiled
as
i
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
myself
and
he
made
it
too
at
me
and
i
saw
his
lips
move
as
he
blessed
me
he
was
not
an
arm
length
from
me
that
was
enough
for
me
and
i
stepped
back
again
and
mounted
my
horse
once
more
the
fellow
who
had
let
me
through
looked
at
me
over
his
shoulder
once
or
twice
but
said
nothing
for
he
had
my
guinea
and
as
for
myself
i
sat
content
though
my
eyes
pricked
with
tears
for
i
had
had
the
last
blessing
or
very
nearly
which
that
martyr
of
god
would
ever
give
in
this
world
when
they
were
all
ready
and
the
five
were
bound
on
the
sleds
with
their
beads
to
the
horses
heels
i
looked
to
see
how
i
could
best
follow
and
it
appeared
to
me
that
it
was
best
for
me
to
keep
close
at
the
tail
rather
than
to
attempt
to
go
before
when
the
word
was
given
the
whips
cracked
and
the
sled
nearest
me
with
whitbread
and
harcourt
upon
it
began
to
move
then
came
turner
and
gavan
and
last
fenwick
all
by
himself
the
minister
whose
name
was
samuel
smith
as
i
learned
later
and
who
was
the
ordinary
of
newgate
followed
on
foot
and
behind
him
came
the
guards
to
close
them
all
in
my
fellow
in
front
whom
i
had
bribed
seemed
to
understand
what
i
wanted
for
in
the
confusion
he
let
me
through
and
my
man
james
forced
his
way
after
me
so
that
we
found
ourselves
with
three
or
four
other
gentlemen
riding
immediately
behind
the
guards
as
we
came
out
of
the
court
into
the
street
outside
and
so
we
followed
all
the
way
to
tyburn
that
adventure
of
mine
was
i
think
the
most
observable
i
have
ever
had
and
too
the
greatest
privilege
to
my
soul
for
here
was
i
if
ever
any
man
did
following
the
cross
of
christ
in
the
passion
of
his
servants
such
a
as
i
have
never
made
in
any
church
for
here
was
the
very
road
along
which
so
many
hundreds
of
the
catholic
martyrs
had
passed
before
and
at
the
end
was
waiting
the
very
death
by
which
they
had
died
i
know
that
the
martyrdom
of
these
five
was
not
so
evident
an
one
as
that
of
others
before
them
since
those
died
for
the
faith
directly
and
these
for
an
alleged
conspiracy
yet
before
god
i
think
they
died
no
less
for
religion
since
it
was
in
virtue
of
their
religion
that
they
were
accused
so
then
i
followed
them
all
the
way
along
holborn
we
went
and
high
holborn
and
giles
and
at
last
out
into
the
oxford
road
that
ran
then
between
fields
and
gardens
and
all
the
way
we
went
the
crowds
went
with
us
booing
and
roaring
from
time
to
time
and
others
too
from
the
windows
of
the
houses
joined
in
the
din
that
was
made
at
first
the
way
was
nasty
enough
with
the
pails
that
folks
had
emptied
out
of
doors
into
the
gutter
but
by
the
time
we
reached
the
oxford
road
the
way
was
dusty
only
so
that
the
five
on
the
sleds
were
first
nastied
and
then
the
dust
fell
on
them
from
the
horses
heels
i
could
see
only
face
from
time
to
time
he
kept
his
eyes
closed
the
most
of
the
way
and
was
praying
i
think
of
the
rest
i
could
see
nothing
it
was
a
terrible
sight
to
me
when
we
came
out
at
last
and
saw
the
gallows
the
deadly
nevergreen
as
it
was
called
the
three
posts
with
the
beams
connecting
them
against
the
western
sky
the
ropes
were
in
place
all
in
one
line
and
a
cart
was
there
beneath
them
a
cauldron
too
sent
up
its
smoke
a
little
distance
away
beside
the
brook
all
this
space
was
kept
clear
again
by
guards
and
there
were
some
of
the
new
grenadiers
among
them
in
their
piebald
livery
with
furred
caps
and
without
the
guards
there
was
a
great
crowd
of
people
here
then
was
the
place
of
the
passion
the
confusion
was
so
great
as
the
sleds
went
within
the
line
of
guards
and
the
people
surged
this
way
and
that
that
i
was
forced
somewhat
out
of
the
place
i
had
hoped
to
get
and
found
myself
at
last
a
good
way
off
with
a
press
of
people
between
me
and
the
gallows
so
that
i
could
see
nothing
of
the
unbinding
and
when
they
spoke
later
could
not
hear
all
that
they
said
it
was
not
long
before
they
were
all
in
the
cart
together
with
the
ropes
about
their
necks
and
the
hangman
down
again
upon
the
ground
and
as
soon
as
that
was
done
a
great
silence
fell
everywhere
i
had
seen
gavan
say
something
to
the
hangman
and
he
answered
again
but
i
could
not
hear
what
it
was
then
when
the
silence
fell
i
heard
whitbread
begin
and
the
first
sentence
was
clear
enough
though
his
voice
sounded
thin
at
that
distance
i
suppose
he
said
it
is
expected
i
should
speak
something
to
the
matter
i
am
condemned
for
and
brought
hither
to
suffer
then
he
went
on
to
say
how
he
was
wholly
guiltless
of
any
plot
against
his
majesty
and
that
in
saying
so
he
renounced
and
repudiated
any
pretended
pardons
or
dispensations
that
were
thought
to
have
been
given
him
to
swear
falsely
he
prayed
god
to
bless
his
majesty
and
denied
that
it
was
any
part
of
catholic
teaching
that
a
king
might
be
killed
as
it
was
said
had
been
designed
by
the
alleged
plot
and
he
ended
by
recommending
his
soul
into
the
hands
of
his
blessed
redeemer
by
whose
only
merits
and
passion
he
hoped
for
salvation
he
spoke
very
clearly
with
a
kind
of
coldness
father
harcourt
voice
was
not
so
clear
as
he
was
an
old
man
but
i
heard
sheriff
how
presently
interrupt
him
he
was
upon
horseback
close
beside
the
gallows
or
of
sir
edmund
berry
godfrey
death
he
asked
did
you
not
write
that
letter
concerning
the
dispatch
of
sir
edmund
berry
godfrey
no
sir
cried
the
old
man
very
loud
these
are
the
words
of
a
dying
man
i
would
not
do
it
for
a
thousand
worlds
he
went
on
to
affirm
his
innocence
of
all
laid
to
his
charge
and
he
ended
by
begging
the
prayers
of
all
in
the
communion
of
the
roman
church
in
which
he
himself
died
when
anthony
turner
had
spoke
a
while
again
sheriff
how
interrupted
him
you
do
only
justify
yourselves
here
he
said
we
will
not
believe
a
word
that
you
say
spend
your
time
in
prayer
and
we
will
not
think
your
time
too
long
but
turner
went
on
as
before
affirming
his
entire
innocence
and
at
the
end
he
prayed
aloud
and
i
heard
every
word
of
it
o
my
dear
saviour
and
redeemer
he
cried
lifting
up
his
eyes
and
his
hands
too
as
well
as
he
could
for
the
cords
i
return
thee
immortal
thanks
for
all
thou
hast
pleased
to
do
for
me
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
and
now
in
the
hour
of
my
death
with
a
firm
belief
of
all
things
thou
hast
revealed
and
a
stedfast
hope
of
obtaining
everlasting
bliss
i
cheerfully
cast
myself
into
the
arms
of
thy
mercy
whose
arms
were
stretched
on
the
cross
for
my
redemption
sweet
jesus
receive
my
spirit
then
gavan
spoke
to
the
same
effect
as
the
rest
but
he
argued
a
little
more
and
theologically
too
being
a
young
man
and
spoke
of
mariana
the
jesuit
who
had
seemed
to
teach
a
doctrine
but
this
sense
on
his
words
he
repudiated
altogether
he
too
at
the
end
commended
his
soul
into
the
hands
of
god
and
said
that
he
was
ready
to
die
for
jesus
as
jesus
had
died
for
him
fenwick
had
scarcely
begun
before
sheriff
how
broke
in
on
him
and
argued
with
him
concerning
the
murder
of
sir
edmund
as
for
sir
edmund
berry
godfrey
cried
fenwick
i
protest
before
god
that
i
never
saw
the
man
in
my
life
for
my
part
said
the
sheriff
i
am
of
opinion
that
you
had
a
hand
in
it
now
that
i
am
a
dying
man
said
the
priest
do
you
think
that
i
would
go
and
damn
my
soul
i
wish
you
all
the
good
that
i
can
said
how
but
i
assure
you
i
believe
never
a
word
you
say
well
he
let
him
alone
after
that
and
fenwick
finished
once
more
denying
and
renouncing
the
part
that
had
been
assigned
to
him
and
maintaining
his
innocence
there
followed
after
that
a
very
long
silence
of
half
an
hour
i
should
think
the
five
men
stood
in
the
cart
together
with
their
eyes
cast
down
and
each
i
think
absolved
his
neighbour
the
crowd
about
kept
pretty
quiet
only
murmuring
together
and
cried
no
more
insults
at
them
i
too
did
my
best
to
pray
with
them
and
for
them
but
my
horse
was
restless
and
i
had
some
ado
to
keep
him
quiet
after
a
good
while
sheriff
how
spoke
to
them
again
pray
aloud
gentlemen
that
we
may
join
with
you
we
shall
do
you
no
hurt
if
we
do
you
no
good
they
said
nothing
to
that
and
he
spoke
again
with
some
sharpness
are
you
ashamed
of
your
prayers
still
they
did
not
speak
and
he
turned
on
father
gavan
why
gavan
he
said
it
is
reported
that
you
did
preach
in
the
quakers
the
priest
opened
his
eyes
no
sir
he
said
i
never
did
preach
there
in
all
my
life
it
was
very
solemn
and
dreadful
to
wait
there
while
they
prayed
for
they
were
at
it
again
for
twenty
minutes
i
should
judge
and
no
more
interruptions
from
how
who
i
think
was
a
shade
uneasy
it
was
a
clear
june
day
beginning
to
be
hot
and
the
birds
were
chirping
in
the
trees
about
the
place
for
at
times
the
silence
was
so
great
that
one
could
hear
a
pin
fall
as
they
say
now
i
felt
on
the
brink
of
hell
at
the
thought
of
the
pains
that
were
waiting
for
my
friends
at
the
memory
of
that
great
effusion
of
blood
that
had
been
poured
out
and
of
the
more
that
was
to
follow
there
was
something
shocking
in
the
quietness
and
the
glory
of
the
day
such
a
day
as
many
that
i
had
spent
in
the
meadows
of
hare
street
or
in
the
high
woods
faced
as
it
was
with
this
dreadful
thing
against
the
blue
sky
and
the
five
figures
beneath
it
like
figures
in
a
frieze
and
the
smoke
of
the
cauldron
that
drifted
up
continually
or
brought
a
reek
of
tar
to
my
nostrils
and
again
all
this
would
pass
and
i
would
feel
that
it
was
not
hell
but
heaven
that
waited
and
that
all
was
but
as
a
thin
veil
a
little
shadow
of
death
that
hung
between
me
and
the
unimaginable
glories
and
that
at
a
word
all
would
dissolve
away
and
christ
come
and
this
world
be
ended
so
then
the
minutes
passed
for
me
i
said
my
and
and
and
over
and
over
again
praying
that
the
passage
of
those
men
might
be
easy
and
that
their
deaths
might
be
as
sacrifices
both
for
themselves
and
for
the
country
i
was
beyond
fearing
for
myself
now
i
was
in
a
kind
of
madness
of
pity
and
longing
and
at
the
last
i
saw
whitbread
raise
his
head
and
look
at
the
sheriff
there
rose
then
as
he
made
a
sign
a
great
murmur
from
all
the
crowd
i
had
thought
that
they
would
have
been
impatient
but
they
were
not
and
had
kept
silence
very
well
and
i
think
that
this
spectacle
of
the
five
men
praying
had
touched
many
hearts
there
now
however
when
the
end
approached
they
seemed
to
awaken
again
and
to
look
for
it
and
they
began
to
move
their
heads
about
to
see
what
was
done
so
that
the
crowd
was
like
a
field
of
wheat
when
the
wind
goes
over
it
then
fell
a
horrible
thing
there
broke
out
suddenly
a
cry
that
was
like
a
trumpet
suddenly
sounding
after
drums
of
a
different
kind
altogether
from
the
murmuring
that
was
before
i
turned
my
head
whence
it
came
and
saw
a
great
confusion
break
out
in
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
then
i
saw
a
head
and
a
man
bare
head
behind
it
whisk
out
from
the
trees
in
the
direction
of
the
park
and
come
like
a
streak
across
the
open
ground
as
the
galloper
came
nearer
i
could
see
that
he
was
spurring
as
if
for
life
then
once
more
a
great
roar
broke
out
everywhere
a
pardon
a
pardon
and
so
it
was
the
crowd
opened
out
to
let
the
man
through
and
immediately
he
was
at
the
gallows
and
handing
the
paper
to
the
sheriff
a
roar
was
going
up
now
on
all
sides
but
as
in
dumb
play
i
could
see
that
how
was
speaking
to
the
priests
who
still
stood
as
before
whitbread
shook
his
head
in
answer
and
so
did
the
others
then
i
saw
how
make
a
sign
the
hangman
came
forward
again
for
he
had
stepped
back
just
now
and
the
roar
died
suddenly
to
silence
then
i
understood
that
the
pardon
was
offered
only
on
conditions
which
these
men
could
not
accept
and
indeed
they
turned
out
afterwards
to
be
that
they
should
confess
their
guilt
and
my
anger
at
that
bitter
mockery
swelled
up
so
that
i
could
scarcely
hold
myself
in
but
i
did
so
then
the
hangman
climbed
once
more
into
the
cart
and
one
by
one
with
each
he
adjusted
the
rope
and
then
pulled
down
the
caps
over
their
faces
beginning
with
father
whitbread
and
ending
with
father
fenwick
then
he
got
down
from
the
cart
again
and
the
murmur
rose
once
more
to
a
roar
i
kept
my
eyes
fixed
upon
the
five
caring
for
nothing
else
and
even
in
that
horrible
instant
my
lips
moved
in
the
for
their
souls
easy
passage
then
i
saw
old
father
harcourt
suddenly
stagger
and
then
the
rest
staggered
and
i
saw
that
the
cart
was
being
pulled
away
and
then
all
five
of
them
were
in
the
air
together
beginning
to
twist
to
and
fro
and
i
shut
my
eyes
for
i
could
bear
no
more
chapter
xi
it
was
not
till
we
were
coming
down
martin
lane
on
the
way
to
whitehall
that
my
thoughts
ran
clear
again
and
i
could
think
upon
the
designs
i
had
formed
until
then
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
rode
as
in
a
dream
seeing
my
thoughts
before
me
but
having
no
power
to
look
within
or
consider
myself
one
thing
too
moved
before
me
whenever
i
closed
my
eyes
and
that
was
the
slow
twisting
frieze
of
the
five
figures
against
the
blue
sky
i
spoke
suddenly
to
james
as
we
went
you
will
leave
me
i
said
at
the
whitehall
gate
and
go
back
to
my
lodgings
procure
a
pair
of
good
horses
at
the
covent
garden
inn
and
say
we
will
leave
them
at
any
place
they
name
on
the
dover
road
he
answered
that
he
would
do
so
and
it
was
the
first
word
he
had
spoken
since
we
had
left
tyburn
at
the
i
found
no
difficulty
in
admittance
for
it
was
the
hour
for
changing
guard
and
a
lieutenant
that
was
known
to
me
let
me
in
at
once
so
i
went
straight
in
and
across
the
court
just
as
i
was
in
my
dusty
clothes
and
boots
carrying
nothing
but
my
my
mind
now
seethed
with
bitter
thoughts
and
words
now
fell
into
a
stupor
and
i
rehearsed
nothing
of
what
i
should
say
to
his
majesty
except
that
i
was
done
with
his
service
and
was
then
going
to
france
for
a
little
unless
it
pleased
him
to
have
me
arrested
and
hanged
too
for
nothing
then
i
would
give
him
back
his
papers
and
begone
i
came
up
the
stairs
to
chiffinch
lodgings
just
as
himself
came
out
and
he
fell
back
a
step
when
he
saw
me
why
where
do
you
come
from
he
asked
they
are
after
me
i
said
briefly
but
that
is
not
all
why
what
else
said
he
staring
at
me
i
am
come
from
seeing
the
martyrdoms
i
said
for
god
sake
he
cried
and
caught
me
by
the
arm
and
drew
me
in
now
have
you
dined
he
said
when
he
had
me
in
a
chair
not
yet
he
looked
at
me
fingering
his
lip
i
suppose
you
have
come
to
see
his
majesty
he
said
i
told
him
yes
no
more
and
what
if
his
majesty
will
not
see
you
he
asked
trying
me
his
majesty
will
see
me
i
said
i
have
something
for
him
again
he
hesitated
i
think
for
a
minute
or
two
he
thought
it
might
be
a
pistol
or
a
knife
that
i
had
for
the
king
if
i
bring
you
to
him
he
said
will
you
give
me
your
word
to
remain
here
till
i
come
for
you
yes
i
will
do
that
i
said
but
i
must
see
him
immediately
well
said
chiffinch
and
then
without
a
word
he
wheeled
and
went
out
of
the
room
i
do
not
know
how
long
i
sat
there
but
it
may
have
been
half
an
hour
i
sat
like
a
dazed
man
for
i
had
had
no
sleep
and
what
i
had
seen
drove
away
all
desire
for
it
i
sat
there
staring
and
pondering
round
and
round
in
circles
like
a
wheel
turning
now
it
was
of
dorothy
now
of
the
jesuits
now
of
his
majesty
and
chiffinch
now
again
of
the
road
to
dover
and
of
what
i
should
do
in
france
there
came
at
last
a
step
on
the
stairs
and
chiffinch
came
in
at
the
door
he
turned
and
took
from
a
man
in
the
passage
as
i
suppose
a
covered
dish
with
a
spoon
in
it
then
he
shut
the
door
with
his
heel
and
came
forward
and
set
the
dish
down
dinner
first
he
said
i
must
see
his
majesty
i
repeated
why
you
are
an
obstinate
fellow
mallock
he
said
smiling
have
i
not
given
you
my
word
you
shall
see
him
directly
he
leaned
his
hands
on
the
table
and
looked
at
me
mallock
his
majesty
will
be
here
in
ten
minutes
time
i
told
him
you
must
eat
something
first
and
he
said
he
would
wait
till
then
the
stew
he
had
brought
me
was
very
savoury
and
i
ate
it
all
up
for
i
had
had
nothing
to
eat
since
supper
last
night
and
by
the
time
i
had
done
and
had
told
him
very
briefly
what
had
passed
at
hare
street
i
felt
some
of
my
bewilderment
was
gone
it
is
marvellous
how
food
can
change
the
moods
of
the
immortal
soul
herself
but
i
was
none
the
less
determined
i
thought
to
leave
the
king
service
for
i
could
not
serve
any
man
i
thought
whose
hands
were
as
red
as
his
in
the
blood
of
innocents
i
had
hardly
done
and
was
blessing
myself
when
chiffinch
went
out
suddenly
and
had
returned
before
i
had
stood
up
to
hold
the
door
open
for
the
king
he
came
in
that
great
prince
for
in
spite
of
all
i
still
count
him
to
be
that
if
not
as
airy
and
as
easy
as
if
nothing
in
the
world
was
the
matter
he
was
but
just
come
from
dinner
and
his
face
was
flushed
a
little
under
its
brown
with
wine
and
his
melancholy
eyes
were
alight
he
was
in
one
of
his
fine
suits
too
for
was
saturday
and
as
it
was
hot
weather
his
suit
was
all
of
thin
silk
with
yellow
lace
and
he
carried
a
long
cane
in
his
ringed
hand
he
might
not
have
had
a
care
in
the
world
to
all
appearances
and
he
smiled
at
me
as
if
i
were
but
just
come
back
from
a
day
in
the
country
well
mallock
he
said
and
put
out
his
hand
to
be
kissed
now
i
had
determined
not
to
kiss
his
hand
whatever
the
consequences
might
be
but
when
i
saw
him
like
that
i
could
do
no
otherwise
for
my
love
and
my
pity
for
him
if
i
may
use
such
a
word
of
a
subject
towards
his
sovereign
surged
up
again
which
i
thought
were
dead
for
ever
so
i
was
on
my
knees
in
an
instant
and
i
kissed
his
brown
hand
and
smelled
the
faint
violet
essence
which
he
used
then
before
i
could
say
anything
he
had
me
down
in
a
chair
and
himself
in
another
and
was
beginning
to
talk
chiffinch
was
gone
out
but
i
had
not
seen
him
go
it
is
a
bloody
business
he
said
sorrowfully
a
very
bloody
business
but
what
else
could
be
done
if
i
had
not
consented
i
would
be
no
longer
king
but
off
on
my
travels
again
and
all
england
in
confusion
however
that
is
as
it
may
be
what
do
you
want
to
see
me
for
mr
mallock
he
spoke
so
kindly
to
me
and
with
such
feeling
too
and
his
condescension
seemed
to
me
so
infinite
in
his
coming
here
to
wait
upon
me
though
this
was
very
often
his
custom
i
think
when
he
wished
to
see
a
man
or
a
woman
in
private
that
i
determined
to
put
off
my
announcement
to
him
that
i
could
no
longer
be
in
his
service
so
first
i
drew
out
from
my
waistcoat
the
packet
i
had
taken
from
under
my
shirt
and
put
there
while
chiffinch
was
away
sir
i
said
i
have
brought
your
packet
back
again
i
have
had
no
word
from
you
as
to
its
delivery
and
as
i
must
go
abroad
i
dare
keep
it
no
longer
your
majesty
i
fear
must
find
another
messenger
his
face
darkened
for
an
instant
as
if
he
could
not
remember
something
but
it
lightened
again
as
he
took
the
packet
from
me
and
turned
it
over
why
i
remember
he
said
it
was
sealed
within
and
without
was
it
not
that
seemed
to
me
a
strangely
irrelevant
thing
to
say
but
i
told
him
yes
it
was
and
you
were
to
deliver
to
eh
what
was
his
name
your
majesty
told
me
that
the
name
would
be
sent
to
me
why
so
i
did
said
the
king
smiling
well
let
us
open
the
packet
and
see
what
is
within
he
took
up
a
little
ivory
knife
that
was
on
the
table
by
his
elbow
and
slipped
it
beneath
the
folds
of
the
paper
so
as
to
burst
open
the
seals
and
when
he
had
done
that
there
was
another
wrapper
also
sealed
this
seal
he
also
scrutinized
still
smiling
a
little
and
then
he
burst
that
and
when
he
had
taken
off
that
covering
a
folded
piece
of
paper
fell
out
this
he
unfolded
and
spread
flat
with
his
fingers
and
there
was
nothing
written
on
that
side
then
he
turned
it
over
and
shewed
me
how
there
was
nothing
written
on
that
either
so
the
message
i
had
borne
about
me
was
nothing
in
the
world
but
a
piece
of
blank
paper
i
drew
a
long
breath
when
i
saw
that
for
my
anger
surged
up
at
the
way
i
had
been
fooled
but
before
i
could
think
of
anything
to
say
the
king
spoke
mallock
he
said
you
have
done
very
well
you
understand
it
now
eh
no
sir
i
do
not
i
said
why
it
is
a
very
old
trick
went
on
his
majesty
to
see
if
a
messenger
will
be
faithful
your
folks
did
it
first
i
think
in
queen
bess
her
reign
so
as
to
risk
nothing
and
you
have
kept
it
all
this
while
i
obeyed
your
majesty
commands
i
said
well
and
you
have
delivered
it
to
the
right
person
he
tossed
the
papers
altogether
upon
the
table
and
turned
to
me
again
now
sir
i
had
no
real
doubt
of
you
but
others
were
not
so
sure
and
i
consented
to
this
to
please
them
so
now
that
all
has
been
done
i
can
use
you
more
freely
if
you
will
i
have
more
than
one
mission
which
must
be
done
for
me
and
if
you
like
it
mallock
you
may
have
the
first
sir
i
must
go
to
france
immediately
the
hunt
is
up
after
me
too
what
do
you
mean
by
that
he
said
sharply
the
hunt
what
is
that
i
would
not
weary
your
majesty
with
it
all
but
the
truth
is
that
the
fellow
dangerfield
who
came
after
me
here
came
yesterday
with
a
magistrate
and
near
a
dozen
men
to
hare
street
to
take
me
i
eluded
them
and
came
to
london
you
eluded
them
how
was
that
well
i
told
him
as
shortly
as
i
could
and
he
laughed
outright
when
i
came
to
my
cousin
dolly
part
in
it
why
that
was
very
wittily
done
he
said
the
minx
i
did
not
much
like
that
but
i
could
not
find
fault
with
the
king
and
i
was
at
tyburn
this
morning
sir
what
at
tyburn
at
tyburn
sir
and
i
was
so
sick
at
heart
at
what
i
saw
there
five
of
your
majesty
most
faithful
servants
murdered
in
the
name
of
justice
that
i
would
not
have
cared
greatly
if
i
had
been
hanged
with
them
his
face
darkened
a
little
but
not
with
anger
at
me
it
is
a
bloody
business
as
i
have
said
he
said
gently
but
come
it
is
to
france
that
you
go
there
is
as
good
as
any
other
place
i
said
so
i
be
out
of
the
kingdom
i
have
estates
there
too
but
to
france
will
suit
very
well
said
the
king
for
it
is
to
france
that
i
designed
to
send
you
i
have
plenty
of
couriers
who
can
take
written
messages
and
i
have
plenty
of
men
who
can
talk
some
think
too
much
but
i
have
no
one
at
hand
at
this
moment
whom
i
can
send
to
court
and
who
will
acquit
himself
well
there
and
that
can
take
a
message
too
none
that
is
that
is
not
occupied
what
do
you
say
mallock
would
a
couple
of
months
there
please
you
here
then
was
the
time
for
my
announcement
for
i
knew
that
if
i
did
not
make
it
then
i
should
make
it
never
i
stood
up
and
my
heart
beat
thickly
sir
i
said
six
months
ago
i
would
have
run
anywhere
to
serve
you
but
in
six
months
many
things
have
happened
and
i
can
not
serve
a
prince
any
more
who
can
not
keep
his
word
even
to
save
the
innocent
i
had
best
be
gone
again
to
rome
i
think
and
see
what
they
can
give
me
there
i
am
sick
of
england
which
i
once
loved
so
much
it
was
those
very
words
or
others
very
like
them
that
i
said
i
do
not
know
where
i
got
the
courage
to
say
them
for
my
life
lay
altogether
in
the
king
hand
a
word
from
him
or
even
silence
and
i
should
have
kicked
my
heels
that
night
in
newgate
and
a
week
or
two
later
in
the
air
on
a
charge
of
being
in
with
the
jesuits
in
their
plot
yet
i
said
them
for
i
could
say
nothing
else
his
majesty
face
turned
black
as
thunder
as
i
began
and
when
i
was
done
it
was
all
stiff
with
pride
that
is
your
mind
mallock
then
he
said
that
is
my
mind
sir
i
answered
him
and
then
a
change
went
over
his
face
once
more
god
knows
why
he
relented
i
think
it
may
have
been
that
he
had
somewhat
of
a
fancy
for
me
and
remembered
how
i
had
pleased
him
and
tried
to
serve
him
and
when
he
spoke
it
was
very
gently
indeed
mallock
he
said
those
are
very
brave
words
but
i
think
they
are
not
worthy
of
a
man
of
your
parts
for
consider
were
you
not
sent
here
by
the
holy
father
to
help
a
poor
sinner
who
had
need
of
it
and
is
it
catholic
charity
to
leave
the
sinner
because
of
his
sins
i
said
nothing
to
that
for
i
was
all
confounded
at
his
mildness
i
suppose
i
had
braced
myself
for
something
very
different
it
is
true
i
am
not
a
catholic
but
were
you
not
sent
here
in
answer
to
my
entreaty
that
you
might
help
to
make
it
easy
for
me
to
become
one
is
it
apostolic
then
to
run
away
so
soon
if
your
majesty
i
burst
out
would
but
shew
some
signs
he
lifted
his
eyebrows
at
that
signs
in
these
days
he
said
why
i
should
hang
myself
in
a
week
time
are
these
the
days
think
you
to
shew
catholicism
why
do
you
not
think
that
my
own
heart
is
not
near
broken
with
all
i
have
had
to
do
he
spoke
with
extraordinary
passion
for
that
was
his
way
when
he
was
very
deeply
moved
which
to
tell
the
truth
however
was
not
very
often
but
i
have
never
known
a
man
so
careless
and
indolent
on
the
surface
who
had
a
softer
heart
than
his
sacred
majesty
if
it
could
but
be
touched
the
blood
of
god
priests
he
cried
holding
the
arms
of
his
chair
so
that
it
shook
their
blood
cries
from
the
ground
against
me
do
you
think
i
do
not
know
that
yet
what
can
i
do
i
am
tied
and
bound
by
circumstance
i
could
not
save
them
and
in
the
attempt
i
could
only
lose
my
own
life
or
throne
as
well
the
people
are
mad
for
their
blood
why
scroggs
himself
said
in
public
at
one
of
the
trials
that
even
the
king
mercy
could
not
come
between
them
and
death
and
it
is
at
this
moment
then
that
the
servants
to
whom
i
had
looked
to
help
me
leave
me
go
if
you
will
mallock
and
save
your
own
soul
you
shall
have
a
safe
passage
to
france
but
never
again
speak
to
me
of
catholic
charity
every
word
that
he
said
rang
true
in
my
heart
it
was
true
indeed
as
he
said
that
no
effort
of
his
could
have
saved
the
men
and
he
could
only
have
perished
himself
there
were
scores
of
men
even
among
his
own
guards
i
have
no
doubt
who
would
have
killed
him
if
he
had
shewn
at
this
time
the
least
mercy
or
the
least
inclination
towards
catholicism
his
back
was
to
the
wall
he
fought
not
for
himself
only
but
for
monarchy
itself
in
england
there
would
have
been
an
end
of
all
and
we
back
again
under
the
tyranny
of
the
commonwealth
if
he
had
acted
otherwise
or
as
i
had
thought
that
he
would
he
had
scarcely
finished
when
i
was
on
my
knees
before
him
sir
i
cried
i
am
heartily
ashamed
of
myself
i
ask
pardon
for
all
that
i
have
said
i
will
go
to
france
or
to
anywhere
else
and
will
think
myself
honoured
by
it
and
by
the
forgiveness
of
your
majesty
sir
let
me
be
your
servant
once
more
the
passion
was
gone
from
his
face
as
he
looked
down
on
me
there
and
he
was
as
before
the
great
prince
with
his
easy
manner
and
his
unimaginable
charm
why
that
is
very
well
said
he
answered
me
and
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
your
services
mallock
chiffinch
will
give
you
all
instructions
that
was
a
very
bold
speech
said
chiffinch
presently
when
the
king
was
gone
away
again
which
you
made
to
his
majesty
why
did
you
hear
it
i
cried
he
smiled
at
me
why
yes
he
said
i
was
behind
the
open
door
just
within
the
further
chamber
i
was
not
sure
of
you
mallock
neither
was
the
king
for
that
matter
sure
of
me
i
thought
perhaps
we
might
have
a
real
threatener
of
the
king
life
at
last
he
said
you
had
a
very
wild
look
when
you
came
in
mr
mallock
yet
his
majesty
came
and
unarmed
i
cried
and
as
happy
as
as
a
king
why
what
else
asked
chiffinch
our
eyes
met
and
for
the
first
time
i
understood
how
even
a
man
like
this
with
his
pandering
to
the
king
pleasures
and
his
own
evil
life
could
have
as
much
love
and
admiration
for
such
a
man
as
i
myself
had
part
ii
chapter
i
i
do
not
mean
to
set
down
in
this
volume
all
that
befell
me
during
the
years
that
i
was
in
the
king
service
partly
because
that
would
make
too
large
a
book
but
chiefly
because
there
were
committed
to
me
affairs
of
which
this
french
one
was
the
first
of
which
i
took
my
oath
never
to
speak
without
leave
up
to
the
present
in
england
nothing
had
been
said
to
me
which
would
be
private
twenty
years
afterwards
i
take
no
shame
at
all
at
revealing
what
little
i
was
able
to
do
for
the
king
personally
in
england
except
perhaps
in
one
or
two
points
which
must
not
be
spoken
of
nor
of
my
adventures
and
my
endeavours
to
be
of
service
to
those
who
were
one
with
me
in
religion
but
of
the
rest
the
least
said
the
soonest
mended
so
the
best
plan
which
i
can
think
of
is
to
leave
out
on
every
occasion
all
that
passed
or
very
nearly
all
when
i
was
out
of
my
country
both
in
france
and
rome
for
i
went
away
on
what
i
may
call
secret
service
three
times
altogether
between
my
first
coming
and
the
king
death
it
is
enough
to
say
that
this
time
i
was
in
paris
about
three
months
and
in
normandy
one
and
that
i
had
acquitted
myself
so
far
to
his
majesty
satisfaction
a
footnote
a
plainly
this
business
of
mallock
had
some
connection
with
charles
perpetual
intrigues
with
france
for
louis
support
of
him
at
this
time
charles
intrigues
were
a
little
unsuccessful
so
it
may
be
supposed
that
without
mallock
they
would
have
been
even
worse
i
returned
to
london
then
on
the
night
of
the
sixteenth
of
november
of
the
same
year
and
i
brought
with
me
a
letter
to
the
king
from
a
certain
personage
in
france
now
to
one
living
in
a
catholic
country
the
rumours
that
come
from
others
not
so
happy
are
either
greatly
swollen
and
exaggerated
in
his
mind
or
thought
nothing
of
it
was
the
latter
case
with
me
i
was
in
high
favour
on
both
sides
of
the
channel
and
this
i
suppose
made
me
think
little
of
the
troubles
in
my
own
country
so
when
i
and
james
reached
london
late
in
the
evening
after
riding
up
from
kent
i
went
straight
to
whitehall
as
bold
as
brass
to
demand
to
see
chiffinch
we
had
ridden
fast
and
had
talked
with
but
very
few
folks
and
these
ignorant
so
that
i
knew
nothing
of
what
impended
and
was
astonished
that
the
sentinels
at
the
gate
eyed
me
so
suspiciously
yes
sir
said
the
younger
to
whom
i
had
addressed
myself
and
what
might
your
business
with
chiffinch
be
i
had
learned
by
now
not
to
quack
gossip
or
to
parley
with
underlings
so
i
answered
him
very
shortly
then
fetch
the
lieutenant
i
said
and
sat
back
on
my
horse
like
a
great
person
when
the
lieutenant
came
he
was
one
i
had
never
seen
before
nor
he
me
and
he
too
asked
me
what
i
wanted
with
chiffinch
lord
man
i
cried
for
i
was
weary
with
my
journey
and
a
little
impatient
do
you
think
i
shall
blurt
out
private
business
for
all
the
world
to
hear
send
me
under
guard
if
you
will
a
man
on
each
side
so
you
send
me
he
did
not
do
that
for
i
think
he
thought
that
i
might
be
some
important
personage
from
my
way
with
him
but
he
would
not
let
james
come
in
too
and
he
said
a
man
must
go
with
me
to
show
me
the
way
or
i
him
i
said
however
let
it
be
so
and
i
told
james
to
ride
on
to
the
lodgings
and
make
all
ready
for
me
there
now
i
had
heard
in
france
of
the
events
in
the
kingdom
but
as
they
had
not
greatly
affected
catholics
and
if
anything
had
even
helped
them
i
was
in
no
great
state
of
mind
within
a
week
of
my
getting
to
paris
the
news
came
of
how
the
duke
of
monmouth
had
been
sent
with
an
army
to
scotland
and
had
trounced
the
highlanders
who
prayed
and
preached
when
they
should
have
fought
at
bothwell
bridge
on
the
river
clyde
and
of
the
punishment
he
inflicted
on
them
afterwards
though
this
was
nothing
to
what
sharpe
who
had
been
killed
by
them
in
may
or
lauderdale
would
have
done
to
them
of
catholic
fortunes
there
was
not
a
great
deal
of
bad
news
and
some
good
sir
george
wakeman
with
three
benedictines
was
acquitted
of
any
design
to
murder
the
king
and
kerne
a
priest
had
been
acquitted
at
hereford
of
the
charge
under
elizabeth
that
famous
statute
still
in
force
that
forbade
any
priest
that
had
received
orders
beyond
the
seas
to
reside
in
england
on
the
other
hand
in
the
provinces
a
few
had
suffered
of
whom
i
remember
on
the
feast
of
the
assumption
a
franciscan
named
johnson
a
man
of
family
had
been
condemned
at
worcester
and
will
plessington
at
chester
and
these
were
executed
since
then
no
deaths
that
i
had
heard
of
had
taken
place
in
england
for
such
causes
and
affairs
seemed
pretty
quiet
i
was
all
unprepared
then
for
the
news
i
had
from
chiffinch
as
soon
as
he
had
greeted
me
and
paid
me
compliments
on
the
way
i
had
done
my
french
business
you
are
come
just
in
time
he
said
ruefully
we
are
to
have
a
great
i
hear
i
asked
him
what
that
might
be
lolling
in
my
chair
for
i
was
stiff
with
riding
why
it
is
your
old
friend
dangerfield
i
hear
who
is
the
thorn
in
our
pillow
now
he
hath
first
feigned
to
discover
a
covenanting
plot
against
his
majesty
and
then
turned
it
into
a
popish
one
there
has
been
much
foolish
talk
about
a
and
papers
hidden
in
it
and
and
now
there
is
to
be
a
great
procession
of
malcontents
to
burn
the
pope
and
the
devil
and
sir
george
jeffreys
and
god
knows
who
at
temple
bar
but
that
is
not
all
why
what
else
i
asked
and
why
is
not
the
procession
forbidden
who
do
you
think
is
behind
it
all
he
said
why
no
one
less
than
my
lord
shaftesbury
himself
dangerfield
is
but
one
of
his
tools
and
that
is
not
all
lord
said
i
what
a
troublous
country
i
spoke
lightly
for
i
did
not
understand
the
weight
of
all
these
events
what
else
is
the
matter
it
is
the
duke
of
monmouth
he
said
who
is
the
pawn
in
shaftesbury
game
my
lord
would
give
the
world
to
have
the
duke
declared
legitimate
and
so
oust
james
his
grace
of
monmouth
is
something
of
a
popular
hero
now
after
his
doings
in
scotland
and
most
of
all
since
he
stands
for
the
protestant
religion
he
hath
dared
to
strike
out
the
bar
sinister
from
his
arms
too
and
goeth
about
the
country
as
if
he
were
truly
royal
so
his
royal
highness
is
gone
back
to
scotland
again
in
a
great
fury
and
his
majesty
is
once
again
in
a
strait
betwixt
two
as
the
scriptures
say
there
is
his
catholic
brother
on
the
one
side
and
there
is
this
young
spark
of
a
protestant
bastard
on
the
other
we
shall
know
better
how
the
feeling
runs
his
majesty
was
taken
very
ill
in
august
and
i
am
not
surprised
at
it
this
was
all
very
heavy
news
for
me
i
had
hoped
in
france
that
most
at
least
of
the
catholic
troubles
were
over
and
now
here
again
they
were
in
a
new
form
i
sighed
aloud
heigho
i
said
but
this
is
all
beyond
me
chiffinch
i
had
best
be
gone
into
the
country
i
think
you
had
he
said
very
seriously
you
can
do
nothing
in
this
place
i
was
very
glad
when
i
heard
him
say
that
for
i
had
thought
a
great
deal
of
hare
street
and
of
my
cousin
dolly
there
and
it
was
good
news
to
me
to
hear
that
i
might
soon
see
her
again
but
i
must
see
the
sight
i
said
and
soon
after
that
i
took
my
leave
it
was
a
marvellous
sight
indeed
the
next
evening
i
went
to
see
a
martin
in
the
morning
that
lived
in
the
strand
a
catholic
bookseller
and
got
leave
from
him
to
sit
in
his
window
from
dinner
onwards
that
i
might
see
the
show
it
was
about
five
that
the
affair
began
and
the
day
was
pretty
dark
by
then
a
great
number
of
people
began
to
assemble
little
by
little
up
fleet
street
on
the
one
side
the
strand
on
the
other
and
down
chancery
lane
in
the
midst
for
it
was
announced
everywhere
and
even
by
criers
in
some
parts
that
the
procession
would
take
place
and
would
end
at
temple
bar
my
lord
shaftesbury
who
had
lately
lost
the
presidency
of
the
council
had
rendered
himself
irreconcilable
with
the
duke
of
york
and
his
only
hope
as
well
as
of
others
with
him
lay
in
ruining
his
highness
all
this
therefore
was
designed
to
rouse
popular
feeling
against
the
duke
and
the
catholic
cause
so
this
was
my
welcome
home
again
it
was
strange
to
watch
the
folks
assembling
and
the
gradual
kindling
of
the
flambeaux
in
the
windows
on
either
side
of
the
street
were
set
candles
and
a
line
of
coaches
was
drawn
up
against
the
gutter
on
the
further
side
but
still
more
strange
and
disconcerting
were
the
preparations
already
made
to
receive
the
procession
an
open
space
was
kept
by
fellows
with
torches
to
the
east
of
the
city
gate
and
here
looking
towards
the
city
with
her
back
to
the
gate
close
beside
the
pillory
stood
queen
bess
in
effigy
upon
a
pedestal
as
it
were
a
protestant
saint
in
her
shrine
for
the
day
had
been
chosen
on
account
of
its
being
the
day
of
her
accession
and
of
queen
mary
death
she
was
set
about
with
gilded
and
bore
a
gilded
sceptre
and
beneath
her
like
some
sacrificial
fire
blazed
a
great
bonfire
roaring
up
to
heaven
with
its
sparks
and
smoke
half
a
dozen
masked
fellows
in
fantastic
dresses
tended
the
bonfire
and
replenished
the
flambeaux
that
burned
about
the
effigy
indeed
it
was
strangely
like
some
pagan
religious
spectacle
the
goddess
at
the
entrance
of
her
temple
for
the
gate
looked
like
that
and
the
resemblance
became
more
marked
as
the
ceremonies
were
performed
which
ended
the
show
a
catholic
might
well
be
pardoned
for
retorting
idolatry
and
saying
that
he
preferred
mary
queen
of
heaven
to
bess
queen
of
england
it
was
from
moorfields
that
the
procession
came
and
it
took
a
good
while
to
come
but
i
was
entertained
enough
by
the
sight
of
all
the
people
to
pass
the
time
away
a
number
of
gentlefolks
opposite
to
my
window
sat
on
platforms
all
wrapped
up
in
furs
and
some
of
them
masked
with
a
few
ministers
among
them
and
i
make
no
doubt
that
tonge
was
there
though
i
did
not
see
him
but
i
did
see
a
merry
face
which
i
thought
was
mistress
nell
gwyn
and
whether
it
was
she
or
not
that
i
saw
i
heard
afterwards
that
she
had
been
there
to
his
great
displeasure
and
in
the
same
group
i
saw
killigrew
face
that
had
been
page
to
charles
the
first
and
came
back
to
be
page
to
his
son
for
his
grotesque
and
yet
fine
face
was
unmistakable
the
profligate
fop
sir
george
etheredge
gambler
and
lampooner
with
drink
and
the
devil
all
over
him
solemn
thomas
thynne
murdered
two
years
afterwards
for
a
woman
sake
by
count
conigsmark
who
was
hanged
for
it
and
lay
in
great
state
in
a
satin
coffin
and
last
my
lord
dover
with
his
great
head
and
little
legs
looking
at
the
people
through
a
tortoiseshell
glass
the
court
or
at
least
some
of
it
enjoyed
itself
here
in
spite
of
the
character
of
the
demonstration
meanwhile
out
of
sight
a
great
voice
shouted
jests
and
catchwords
resonantly
from
time
to
time
to
amuse
the
people
and
the
crowd
that
was
by
now
packed
everywhere
against
the
houses
upon
the
roofs
and
even
up
chancery
lane
answered
his
hits
with
roaring
cheers
i
heard
the
name
of
the
duke
of
monmouth
several
times
and
each
time
it
was
received
with
acclamation
once
the
duke
of
york
was
called
out
and
the
booing
and
murring
at
it
were
great
enough
to
have
daunted
even
him
but
he
was
in
scotland
now
too
far
away
to
hear
it
and
seemed
like
to
remain
there
and
once
gwyn
name
was
shouted
and
something
else
after
it
and
there
was
a
stir
on
the
platform
where
i
thought
i
had
seen
her
and
then
a
great
burst
of
cheering
for
she
was
popular
enough
in
spite
of
her
life
for
her
protestantism
it
was
not
works
they
hated
thought
i
to
myself
but
faith
the
first
that
i
knew
of
the
coming
of
the
procession
was
the
sound
of
fifes
up
fleet
street
and
a
great
jostling
and
roaring
that
followed
it
by
those
who
strove
to
see
better
i
was
distracted
for
an
instant
by
a
dog
that
ran
out
suddenly
tail
down
into
the
open
space
and
disappeared
again
yelping
when
i
turned
again
the
head
of
the
procession
was
in
sight
coming
into
view
round
the
house
that
was
next
to
martin
first
between
the
torches
that
lined
the
procession
through
all
its
length
came
a
band
of
fifers
very
fine
in
scarlet
tunics
and
stiff
shrilling
a
dirge
as
they
walked
and
immediately
behind
them
a
funeral
herald
in
black
walking
very
upright
and
stiff
with
a
bell
in
one
hand
which
he
rang
while
he
cried
out
in
a
great
mournful
bellowing
voice
remember
justice
godfrey
remember
justice
godfrey
and
then
pealed
upon
his
bell
again
it
was
pretty
plain
from
that
that
we
catholics
were
to
bear
the
brunt
of
all
as
usual
behind
him
came
a
terrible
set
of
three
in
the
midst
led
by
a
groom
was
a
great
white
horse
with
bells
on
his
bridle
sounding
as
he
came
and
on
his
back
an
effigy
dressed
in
riding
costume
with
boots
and
with
white
riding
gloves
and
cravat
all
spattered
over
with
blood
his
head
lolled
on
his
shoulders
as
if
the
neck
were
broken
turning
a
pale
bloody
face
from
side
to
side
with
fallen
jaw
and
great
rolling
melancholy
eyes
for
this
was
of
justice
godfrey
beside
him
walked
a
man
in
black
that
held
him
fast
with
one
hand
and
had
a
dripping
dagger
in
the
other
to
represent
a
jesuit
this
was
perhaps
the
worst
of
all
but
there
was
plenty
more
to
come
there
followed
after
justice
godfrey
a
pardoner
dressed
as
a
priest
in
a
black
cope
sown
all
over
with
death
heads
waving
papers
in
his
hands
and
proclaiming
indulgences
to
all
so
loud
that
he
might
be
heard
at
charing
cross
and
next
behind
him
a
fellow
carrying
a
silver
cross
that
shone
very
fine
in
the
red
light
of
the
bonfire
and
the
flambeaux
and
drew
attention
to
what
came
after
for
behind
him
came
eight
religious
carmelites
and
franciscans
in
the
habits
of
their
orders
going
two
by
two
with
clasped
hands
and
bowed
heads
as
if
they
prayed
and
after
them
that
which
was
in
intention
the
centre
of
all
for
this
was
a
set
of
six
jesuits
in
black
with
lean
painted
faces
each
bearing
a
dagger
which
he
waved
gnashing
his
teeth
and
grinning
on
the
folks
there
had
been
enough
roaring
and
cheering
before
but
at
this
sight
the
people
went
near
mad
and
i
had
thought
for
an
instant
that
the
very
actors
would
be
torn
in
pieces
for
the
sake
of
the
parts
they
played
martin
and
his
wife
were
close
beside
me
in
the
window
and
i
turned
to
them
we
are
fortunate
not
to
be
jesuits
i
said
and
known
to
be
such
our
lives
would
not
be
worth
a
pin
he
nodded
at
me
very
gravely
and
i
saw
how
white
was
his
wife
face
when
i
looked
again
a
very
brilliant
group
was
come
into
view
four
bishops
in
rochets
and
violet
with
large
pectoral
crosses
these
walked
very
proud
and
prelatical
looking
disdainfully
at
the
people
who
roared
at
the
burlesque
and
behind
them
again
four
more
in
gilded
mitres
i
do
not
know
what
this
generation
knew
of
catholic
bishops
for
not
one
in
a
thousand
of
them
had
ever
set
eyes
on
one
after
a
little
space
followed
six
cardinals
in
scarlet
very
gorgeous
with
caps
and
trains
of
the
same
colour
these
swept
along
looking
to
neither
right
nor
left
followed
by
a
lean
man
in
a
black
silk
suit
and
gown
skulking
and
bending
bearing
a
glass
retort
in
one
hand
and
a
phial
with
a
label
flying
from
it
in
the
other
on
this
was
written
i
heard
afterwards
the
words
but
i
could
not
read
it
from
where
i
was
then
at
last
the
tail
of
the
procession
began
to
come
into
view
two
priests
in
great
white
copes
bore
aloft
each
a
tall
cross
and
behind
them
i
could
see
through
the
flare
and
reek
of
the
torches
a
vast
scarlet
chair
advancing
above
the
heads
of
the
people
it
was
borne
on
a
platform
and
was
embroidered
all
over
with
gold
and
silver
bullion
upon
the
platform
itself
were
four
boys
two
and
two
on
either
side
of
the
throne
in
red
and
cassocks
and
short
white
surplices
each
with
a
tall
red
cross
held
in
the
inner
hand
and
a
bloodstained
dagger
in
the
other
which
they
waved
now
and
again
upon
the
throne
itself
sat
a
huge
effigy
it
was
dressed
in
a
scarlet
robe
embroidered
like
the
throne
its
feet
in
gold
embroidered
slippers
were
thrust
forward
on
a
cushion
its
hands
in
rich
gloves
were
clasped
to
the
arms
of
the
chair
and
its
grinning
waxen
face
very
pale
was
surmounted
by
a
vast
tiara
on
which
were
three
crowns
one
above
the
other
round
the
neck
hung
a
gold
cross
and
chain
and
a
pair
of
great
keys
hung
down
on
one
side
a
devil
in
tight
fitting
black
with
a
masked
face
and
long
sprouting
nails
with
a
tail
hung
behind
him
and
two
tall
horns
on
his
head
rolled
his
eyes
from
side
to
side
and
whispered
continually
into
the
ear
of
the
effigy
from
behind
the
throne
a
great
mob
of
people
and
torches
and
guards
came
shouting
on
behind
and
when
i
saw
that
a
kind
of
despair
came
upon
me
if
that
thought
i
is
what
my
countrymen
think
of
catholics
and
the
holy
father
what
use
to
strive
any
more
for
their
conversion
by
the
time
that
the
tail
had
come
up
the
rest
of
the
procession
was
disposed
round
the
bonfire
leaving
a
broad
space
in
the
midst
where
the
throne
and
effigy
might
be
set
down
and
now
there
appeared
on
the
pillory
beside
the
queen
image
one
of
the
six
cardinals
that
had
come
up
a
little
while
before
and
began
a
sort
of
rhyming
dialogue
with
a
choir
that
was
set
on
another
platform
over
against
him
i
could
not
hear
all
that
was
said
although
the
people
kept
pretty
quiet
to
hear
it
too
but
i
heard
enough
the
cardinal
was
proclaiming
the
catholic
religion
as
the
only
means
of
salvation
and
threatened
both
temporal
and
eternal
punishment
to
all
that
would
not
have
it
and
the
choir
answered
roaring
out
the
glories
of
england
and
protestantism
the
fifes
screamed
for
the
words
as
if
accompanying
them
and
trumpets
answered
him
for
england
and
at
the
end
shaking
his
fist
at
the
queen
and
with
another
gesture
as
of
despair
he
came
down
from
the
pillory
then
came
the
end
the
devil
behind
the
throne
slipped
altogether
behind
it
and
stood
tossing
his
hands
with
delight
while
meantime
the
effigy
contrived
in
some
way
i
could
not
understand
rose
stiffly
from
the
seat
and
stood
upright
first
he
lifted
his
hands
as
if
in
entreaty
towards
the
queen
image
then
he
shook
them
as
if
threatening
meanwhile
rolling
his
head
with
its
tiara
from
side
to
side
as
if
seeking
supporters
two
men
then
sprang
upon
the
platform
as
if
in
answer
dressed
like
english
apprentices
and
with
leather
aprons
and
these
seized
each
an
arm
of
the
effigy
and
at
that
the
devil
after
one
more
fit
of
laughter
holding
his
sides
and
shouting
aloud
as
if
in
glee
leapt
down
behind
the
platform
dragging
the
chair
after
him
the
four
boys
stood
an
instant
as
if
in
terror
and
then
followed
him
with
clumsy
gestures
of
horror
the
three
figures
that
remained
now
began
to
wrestle
together
stamping
to
and
fro
up
to
the
very
edge
then
reeling
back
again
and
so
on
the
two
apprentices
against
the
great
red
dummy
at
that
the
shouting
of
the
crowd
grew
louder
and
louder
and
the
torches
tossed
up
and
down
it
was
like
hell
itself
for
noise
and
terror
there
in
the
red
flare
of
the
bonfire
and
at
the
last
all
roaring
together
with
the
trumpets
and
drums
sounding
and
the
fifes
too
the
effigy
was
got
to
the
edge
of
the
platform
where
it
yet
swayed
for
an
instant
or
two
and
then
toppled
down
into
the
fire
beneath
it
was
a
great
spectacle
i
can
not
but
confess
it
and
admirably
designed
and
i
took
my
leave
of
martin
and
his
lady
and
went
home
to
supper
through
the
crowded
streets
more
in
tune
perhaps
with
my
country
state
than
i
had
been
when
i
lolled
last
night
in
chiffinch
closet
chapter
ii
with
dangerfield
demonstration
in
my
mind
i
was
not
greatly
inclined
to
embroil
myself
in
other
matters
and
i
kept
my
intention
to
ride
down
to
hare
street
three
days
after
when
i
had
done
my
business
in
london
and
kissed
the
king
hand
and
this
i
had
done
by
the
evening
of
the
second
day
i
saw
his
majesty
on
that
second
day
but
he
was
much
pressed
for
time
and
he
did
no
more
than
thank
me
for
what
i
had
done
and
so
was
gone
on
that
evening
however
a
new
little
adventure
befell
me
the
taverns
in
town
were
rare
places
for
making
new
acquaintances
and
since
i
for
the
most
part
dined
and
supped
in
them
i
met
a
good
number
of
gentlemen
from
these
i
would
conceal
usually
most
of
my
circumstances
and
sometimes
even
my
name
though
that
would
not
have
told
them
much
above
all
i
was
very
careful
to
conceal
my
dealings
with
his
majesty
and
as
following
the
directions
he
had
first
given
me
i
presented
myself
seldom
or
never
at
court
and
did
my
business
through
chiffinch
and
in
his
lodgings
usually
i
do
not
suppose
that
there
were
five
men
in
town
if
so
many
who
knew
that
i
had
any
private
knowledge
of
him
at
all
in
this
manner
then
i
heard
a
deal
of
treasonable
talk
of
which
i
did
not
think
much
and
only
reported
generally
to
chiffinch
when
he
asked
me
what
was
the
feeling
in
town
with
regard
to
court
affairs
it
was
through
this
and
helped
i
daresay
by
what
i
have
been
told
was
the
easy
pleasantness
which
i
affected
in
company
that
i
stumbled
over
my
next
adventure
and
one
that
was
like
before
the
end
of
it
to
have
cost
me
dear
i
went
to
supper
by
chance
on
the
second
day
after
my
coming
to
london
to
an
inn
i
had
never
been
to
before
the
in
cheapside
a
very
large
inn
in
those
days
with
a
great
garden
at
the
back
where
gentlemen
would
dine
in
summer
and
a
great
parlour
running
out
into
it
from
the
back
of
the
house
of
but
one
story
high
the
rooms
beneath
seemed
pretty
full
for
it
was
a
cold
night
and
as
there
appeared
no
one
to
attend
to
me
i
went
upstairs
and
knocked
on
the
door
of
one
of
the
rooms
the
talking
within
ceased
as
i
knocked
and
none
answered
so
i
opened
the
door
and
put
my
head
in
there
was
a
number
of
persons
seated
round
the
table
who
all
looked
at
me
this
is
a
private
room
sir
said
one
of
them
at
the
head
i
beg
your
pardon
gentlemen
i
said
i
was
but
looking
for
someone
to
serve
me
and
i
was
about
to
withdraw
when
a
voice
hailed
me
aloud
why
it
is
mr
mallock
the
voice
cried
and
turning
again
to
see
who
it
was
i
beheld
my
old
friend
rumbald
seated
next
the
one
that
presided
i
greeted
him
but
i
had
best
be
gone
i
said
it
is
a
private
room
the
gentleman
told
me
no
no
cried
the
maltster
come
in
mr
mallock
and
he
said
something
to
the
gentleman
he
sat
by
who
was
dressed
very
finely
i
could
see
that
something
was
in
the
wind
and
as
i
was
out
for
adventure
it
seemed
to
me
that
here
was
one
however
harmless
it
might
turn
out
in
the
end
so
i
closed
the
door
behind
me
there
was
a
shifting
along
the
benches
and
i
stepped
over
into
a
place
next
my
friend
how
goes
the
world
with
you
sir
demanded
rumbald
of
me
looking
at
my
suit
which
indeed
was
pretty
fine
very
hungrily
at
present
i
said
where
the
devil
are
the
maids
got
to
he
called
out
to
the
man
that
sat
nearest
the
door
and
he
got
up
and
bawled
something
down
the
passage
but
it
has
treated
me
better
lately
i
said
i
have
been
in
france
on
my
affairs
i
said
this
with
an
important
air
for
there
is
no
disguise
so
great
as
the
truth
if
it
is
put
on
a
little
awry
oho
said
rumbald
who
again
in
spite
of
his
old
presbyterianism
had
had
a
cup
too
many
and
he
winked
on
the
company
i
had
not
an
idea
of
what
he
meant
by
that
but
i
think
he
was
but
shewing
off
his
friend
as
a
travelled
gentleman
and
we
have
been
speaking
of
england
he
went
on
and
of
them
that
govern
it
and
of
the
ten
commandments
in
special
the
sixth
i
observed
signs
of
consternation
among
one
or
two
of
the
company
when
he
said
this
and
remembering
of
what
political
complexion
rumbald
had
been
on
our
previous
meeting
i
saw
in
general
at
least
what
they
had
been
after
but
what
he
meant
of
the
sixth
commandment
which
is
that
of
killing
according
to
the
protestant
arrangement
of
it
i
understood
nothing
and
of
who
shall
govern
england
hereafter
i
said
in
a
low
voice
but
very
deliberate
there
fell
a
silence
when
i
said
that
and
i
was
wondering
what
in
name
i
should
say
next
when
the
maid
came
in
and
i
fell
to
abusing
of
her
with
an
oath
or
two
when
she
was
gone
away
again
to
get
me
my
supper
the
gentleman
in
the
fine
dress
at
the
head
of
the
table
leaned
forward
a
little
that
mallock
he
said
is
of
what
we
were
speaking
how
did
you
know
that
i
know
my
friend
rumbald
i
said
this
appeared
to
give
the
greatest
pleasure
to
the
maltster
he
laughed
aloud
and
beat
me
on
the
back
but
his
eyes
were
fierce
for
all
his
merriment
i
felt
that
this
would
be
no
easy
enemy
to
have
mallock
knows
me
he
said
and
i
know
mallock
i
assure
you
gentlemen
you
can
speak
freely
before
mr
mallock
and
he
poured
a
quantity
of
his
into
a
tankard
that
stood
before
me
it
appeared
however
that
several
of
the
company
had
sudden
affairs
elsewhere
and
before
we
even
smelled
of
treason
three
or
four
of
them
made
their
excuses
and
went
away
this
confirmed
me
in
my
thought
that
i
was
stumbled
upon
one
of
those
little
gatherings
of
malcontents
of
whom
the
town
was
full
who
talked
largely
over
their
cups
of
the
protestant
succession
and
the
like
but
did
very
little
but
i
was
not
quite
right
in
my
surmise
as
will
appear
presently
by
the
time
that
my
supper
came
up
i
cursed
the
maid
again
for
her
delay
though
poor
wench
she
was
near
run
off
her
legs
there
were
left
but
four
of
us
in
the
room
the
gentleman
at
the
head
of
the
table
a
lean
quiet
man
with
a
cast
in
his
eye
who
sat
opposite
me
rumbald
and
myself
there
was
however
a
shade
of
caution
yet
left
in
my
friend
that
the
ale
had
not
yet
driven
out
and
before
proceeding
any
further
he
observed
again
that
my
fortunes
had
improved
why
they
have
improved
a
great
deal
i
said
for
he
had
caught
me
with
my
sword
and
my
lace
and
i
saw
him
looking
at
them
i
live
in
covent
garden
now
where
you
must
come
and
see
me
mr
rumbald
and
your
politics
with
them
he
asked
my
politics
are
what
they
ever
were
i
said
and
that
was
true
enough
you
were
at
temple
bar
he
asked
why
i
only
came
from
france
the
day
before
but
you
may
depend
upon
it
i
was
there
it
warmed
my
heart
you
know
who
was
behind
it
all
asked
the
gentleman
at
the
head
of
the
table
suddenly
i
knew
well
enough
that
such
men
as
these
despise
ignorance
above
all
things
and
that
a
shrewd
fellow
or
a
man
that
they
think
to
be
one
is
worth
a
thousand
simpletons
in
their
eyes
so
i
made
no
pretence
of
not
knowing
what
he
meant
why
of
course
i
do
i
said
contemptuously
it
was
my
lord
shaftesbury
now
the
truth
of
this
was
not
known
to
everyone
in
london
at
this
time
though
it
was
known
a
little
while
later
and
i
should
not
have
known
it
myself
if
chiffinch
had
not
told
me
but
these
men
knew
it
it
seemed
well
enough
and
my
knowledge
of
it
blew
me
in
their
view
my
lord
shaftesbury
god
bless
him
said
the
lean
squinting
man
suddenly
and
drained
his
mug
god
bless
him
i
said
too
and
put
my
lips
to
mine
my
hand
was
immediately
grasped
by
rumbald
and
so
cordial
relations
were
confirmed
well
we
settled
down
then
to
talk
treason
i
must
not
deny
that
these
persons
skewed
still
some
glimmerings
of
sense
they
did
not
that
is
to
say
as
yet
commit
themselves
irrevocably
to
my
mercy
they
appeared
to
me
to
talk
generally
with
a
view
to
trying
me
but
i
acquitted
myself
to
their
satisfaction
we
deposed
charles
we
excluded
james
we
legitimized
monmouth
we
armed
the
loyal
citizens
and
took
away
the
arms
of
all
others
we
appointed
even
days
of
humiliation
and
thanksgiving
and
we
grew
more
enthusiastic
and
reckless
with
every
mug
the
lean
man
confided
to
me
with
infinite
pride
that
he
had
been
one
of
the
cardinals
in
the
procession
to
temple
bar
and
i
grasped
his
hand
in
tearful
congratulation
we
were
near
weeping
with
loyalty
at
the
end
not
to
charles
but
to
monmouth
the
only
man
who
preserved
his
completely
was
the
gentleman
at
the
head
of
the
table
though
he
too
adventured
a
good
deal
throwing
it
before
me
as
a
bait
before
a
trout
and
each
time
i
gulped
it
down
and
asked
for
more
he
was
a
finely
featured
man
with
a
nose
set
well
out
in
his
face
and
had
altogether
the
look
and
bearing
of
a
gentleman
it
must
have
been
full
nine
before
we
broke
up
and
that
was
at
the
going
of
our
president
we
too
rose
and
saw
him
to
the
door
and
the
lean
man
said
he
would
see
him
downstairs
so
rumbald
and
i
were
left
he
swaying
a
little
and
smiling
holding
on
to
the
and
i
endeavouring
to
preserve
my
dignity
i
was
about
to
say
too
and
begone
when
he
plucked
me
suddenly
by
the
sleeve
come
back
again
mallock
he
said
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
we
went
back
again
shutting
the
door
behind
us
and
sat
down
it
was
a
pleasant
little
parlour
this
decently
furnished
and
i
feigned
to
be
looking
at
the
hanging
that
was
over
the
press
where
they
kept
the
tankards
as
if
i
had
no
curiosity
in
the
world
here
mallock
said
my
friend
voice
behind
me
look
at
this
he
had
drawn
out
a
little
black
and
with
it
three
or
four
loose
papers
i
sat
down
by
him
and
took
it
from
him
it
is
some
kind
of
an
i
said
you
are
right
sir
said
rumbald
he
sat
with
an
air
of
vast
importance
while
i
examined
the
book
it
had
a
great
number
of
entries
concerning
such
things
as
accounts
for
beer
and
other
refreshments
with
others
which
i
could
not
understand
there
were
also
the
names
of
inns
in
london
with
marks
opposite
to
them
and
times
of
day
written
down
besides
i
could
make
nothing
of
all
this
so
i
turned
to
the
papers
here
to
my
astonishment
on
one
of
them
was
written
a
list
of
names
some
very
well
known
beginning
with
my
lord
shaftesbury
and
on
the
two
others
a
number
of
notes
in
with
three
or
four
of
the
same
names
as
before
written
one
of
these
slipped
to
the
floor
as
i
held
them
and
i
stooped
to
pick
it
up
when
i
raised
my
head
again
the
and
the
other
two
papers
had
disappeared
again
into
rumbald
possession
he
did
not
seem
to
have
seen
the
one
that
fell
so
i
held
it
on
my
knee
beneath
the
table
thinking
to
examine
it
later
well
i
asked
what
is
the
matter
the
maltster
had
an
air
of
great
mystery
upon
his
face
he
regarded
me
sternly
though
his
eyes
watered
a
little
enough
to
hang
us
all
he
said
and
i
saw
the
fierce
light
in
his
eyes
again
through
the
veil
of
drink
why
how
is
that
asked
i
slipping
the
paper
i
held
behind
me
and
into
the
skirt
pocket
of
my
coat
those
accounts
he
said
they
are
all
for
the
procession
for
i
provided
myself
a
good
deal
of
the
refreshment
and
was
paid
for
it
by
a
man
of
my
lord
who
has
signed
the
book
and
the
two
papers
i
asked
ah
said
rumbald
that
is
another
matter
altogether
i
feigned
that
i
was
incurious
well
i
said
every
man
to
his
own
trade
i
would
not
meddle
with
another
for
the
world
that
is
best
said
my
friend
i
tried
a
sentence
or
two
more
but
caution
seemed
to
have
returned
to
him
though
a
little
late
and
i
presently
saw
i
should
get
no
more
out
of
him
i
congratulated
him
again
on
the
pleasant
evening
we
had
spent
and
five
minutes
later
we
went
downstairs
together
very
friendly
and
he
winked
upon
me
as
i
went
out
after
paying
my
account
as
if
there
were
some
secret
understanding
between
us
i
had
a
cold
walk
back
to
covent
garden
remembering
with
satisfaction
as
i
went
that
i
had
not
told
rumbald
more
particularly
where
i
lodged
and
thinking
over
what
i
had
heard
it
was
not
a
great
deal
after
all
i
thought
when
all
was
said
i
had
only
heard
over
again
what
was
known
well
enough
at
court
that
my
lord
shaftesbury
was
behind
this
demonstration
and
had
his
finger
in
the
whole
affair
of
monmouth
i
had
but
stumbled
upon
one
of
those
companies
who
were
known
well
enough
to
be
everywhere
who
were
for
monmouth
against
his
royal
highness
and
i
had
but
seen
what
surely
might
be
guessed
to
exist
the
accounts
of
the
refreshments
supplied
to
the
actors
in
the
demonstration
and
had
been
told
that
my
lord
man
had
paid
the
score
there
might
indeed
be
more
behind
but
of
that
i
had
no
evidence
at
all
i
had
received
no
confidence
that
could
be
of
any
value
and
as
for
the
paper
in
my
i
valued
it
no
more
than
a
rush
and
wondered
i
had
taken
the
trouble
to
secure
it
when
i
reached
my
lodgings
i
took
it
out
and
looked
at
it
again
i
had
not
even
the
means
of
reading
it
the
name
of
my
lord
shaftesbury
as
i
have
said
was
written
in
three
or
four
times
and
the
duke
of
monmouth
twice
there
also
appeared
other
names
of
which
i
did
not
know
a
great
deal
and
one
at
least
of
which
i
knew
nothing
which
was
college
though
this
for
all
i
knew
was
for
a
college
in
an
university
other
names
were
that
of
my
lord
essex
and
john
hampden
and
algernon
sidney
the
paper
was
about
a
foot
in
length
and
six
inches
across
and
i
thought
so
little
of
it
thinking
that
a
paper
of
importance
would
scarcely
be
entrusted
to
a
man
like
rumbald
who
threw
them
about
a
tavern
that
i
was
very
near
throwing
it
into
the
fire
but
i
kept
it
though
god
knows
that
afterwards
i
wished
i
had
not
done
so
and
slipped
it
into
my
where
i
kept
three
or
four
others
intending
when
i
had
an
opportunity
to
give
it
to
some
clerk
learned
in
to
read
for
me
and
so
i
went
to
bed
chapter
iii
it
was
with
a
very
happy
heart
that
the
next
night
about
seven
i
rode
down
hare
street
village
and
saw
the
lights
of
the
house
shining
through
the
limes
it
was
a
very
different
coming
back
from
my
going
then
we
four
had
stood
together
in
the
dark
at
the
corner
of
the
lane
fearing
lest
a
window
should
be
thrown
up
now
i
rode
back
with
james
secure
and
content
fearing
nothing
for
chiffinch
had
told
me
that
all
peril
had
passed
from
dangerfield
even
had
he
met
me
and
known
me
which
was
not
likely
they
were
after
other
game
now
than
the
old
conspirators
i
had
sent
a
message
to
hare
street
on
the
day
after
i
was
come
to
london
that
i
would
be
with
them
on
this
day
and
so
soon
as
i
rode
into
the
yard
the
men
ran
out
and
i
heard
a
window
open
in
the
house
so
that
by
the
time
i
came
to
the
door
it
was
open
and
my
cousins
there
to
meet
me
it
was
very
strange
that
evening
there
to
be
so
with
my
cousin
dolly
for
each
of
us
knew
and
that
the
other
knew
that
too
that
matters
were
advanced
with
us
since
we
had
been
through
peril
together
it
was
strange
how
diffident
we
both
were
and
how
we
could
not
meet
one
another
eyes
and
yet
i
was
aware
that
she
would
have
it
otherwise
if
she
could
and
strove
to
be
natural
we
had
music
again
that
night
and
dolly
and
her
maid
sang
the
setting
of
go
perjured
man
which
she
had
made
from
mr
wise
for
myself
i
sat
in
a
corner
by
the
fire
and
watched
her
she
was
in
grey
that
night
with
lace
and
a
string
of
little
pearls
when
she
was
gone
to
bed
my
cousin
tom
and
i
had
a
crack
together
and
he
seemed
to
me
more
sensible
than
i
had
thought
him
at
first
we
talked
of
a
great
number
of
things
and
he
asked
me
about
france
and
my
life
there
and
i
had
a
great
ado
from
being
indiscreet
and
telling
him
too
much
i
represented
to
him
that
i
was
gone
over
to
be
out
of
the
way
of
dangerfield
as
indeed
i
had
but
i
said
nothing
at
all
to
him
as
to
my
business
there
and
he
seemed
content
he
told
me
also
of
what
he
had
written
to
me
as
to
the
return
of
harris
very
tired
and
angry
the
next
afternoon
after
his
search
of
the
house
he
had
ridden
near
all
the
way
to
newmarket
inquiring
for
me
everywhere
and
had
come
to
the
conclusion
at
last
that
i
had
not
gone
that
way
after
all
he
was
very
high
with
me
said
my
cousin
tom
but
i
was
higher
yet
i
told
him
that
it
was
not
my
business
both
to
make
conspirators
and
to
arrest
them
and
since
he
had
done
me
the
honour
of
thinking
i
had
done
the
first
i
had
done
him
the
honour
of
thinking
that
he
could
do
the
second
but
that
it
seemed
i
was
wrong
in
that
this
seemed
a
considerable
effort
of
wit
for
my
cousin
tom
but
scarcely
one
calculated
to
soothe
harris
finally
when
i
was
thinking
of
bed
my
cousin
tom
opened
out
once
again
on
an
old
matter
that
was
before
my
mind
continually
now
and
he
spoke
i
think
very
sensibly
cousin
roger
he
said
there
is
one
other
affair
i
must
speak
to
you
of
now
that
you
are
come
again
to
hare
street
and
seem
likely
to
remain
here
for
a
while
and
that
is
of
my
daughter
i
know
you
would
not
have
me
say
too
much
and
i
will
not
but
have
you
considered
the
advice
you
said
you
would
give
me
a
great
while
ago
i
did
not
answer
him
for
a
moment
for
i
was
not
sure
if
he
were
very
wise
or
very
foolish
in
opening
upon
it
again
then
i
determined
to
be
open
with
the
man
cousin
tom
i
said
i
am
both
glad
and
sorry
that
you
have
spoken
of
this
and
i
will
tell
you
the
whole
truth
which
i
think
perhaps
you
may
have
guessed
the
reason
why
i
could
not
give
you
advice
before
was
that
i
was
not
sure
of
my
own
mind
well
i
am
sure
of
it
now
and
i
wish
to
ask
my
cousin
dolly
so
soon
as
i
see
an
opportunity
to
do
so
if
she
will
marry
me
but
i
must
say
this
that
i
am
going
to
take
no
risks
i
shall
not
ask
her
so
long
as
i
think
she
will
refuse
me
and
i
think
to
tell
the
truth
that
she
would
not
have
me
if
i
asked
her
now
my
cousin
tom
began
to
speak
but
i
prevented
him
one
moment
i
said
and
you
shall
say
what
you
will
there
is
one
reason
that
comes
to
my
mind
which
perhaps
may
explain
her
unwillingness
and
that
is
that
she
may
think
that
she
is
being
thrown
at
my
head
you
have
been
very
kind
cousin
in
allowing
me
to
make
this
my
home
in
the
country
and
i
know
here
i
lied
vehemently
i
know
that
nothing
was
further
from
your
thoughts
than
this
yet
it
may
seem
so
to
a
foolish
maid
who
knows
nothing
of
the
world
i
do
not
know
if
you
have
ever
said
anything
to
her
why
cousin
cried
tom
in
such
a
manner
that
i
knew
he
was
lying
too
what
do
you
think
just
so
i
said
for
i
did
not
wish
him
to
lie
more
than
he
need
i
was
sure
i
may
have
said
a
word
or
two
once
or
twice
pursued
cousin
tom
intent
on
his
own
exposure
that
she
must
think
soon
about
getting
married
and
so
forth
but
to
say
that
i
have
thrown
her
at
your
head
cousin
is
not
i
think
a
kindly
thing
my
dear
man
cried
i
i
have
been
saying
expressly
that
i
knew
you
had
done
nothing
of
the
sort
but
that
perhaps
dolly
thought
so
this
quieted
him
a
little
for
i
watched
his
face
so
the
best
way
i
think
is
for
us
all
to
be
quiet
for
a
little
and
say
nothing
you
know
now
what
my
own
wishes
are
and
that
is
enough
for
you
and
me
as
to
estates
i
will
make
a
settlement
if
ever
the
marriage
is
arranged
that
will
satisfy
you
but
i
think
we
need
not
trouble
about
that
at
present
i
will
do
my
utmost
to
push
my
suit
but
it
must
be
in
my
own
way
and
that
way
will
be
to
say
nothing
at
all
for
a
while
but
to
establish
easy
relations
with
her
she
is
a
little
perturbed
at
present
i
saw
that
for
i
watched
her
and
unless
she
can
grow
quiet
again
all
will
come
to
nothing
so
i
spoke
in
the
folly
of
my
own
wisdom
that
seemed
to
me
so
great
at
that
time
i
had
dealt
with
men
but
not
at
all
with
women
and
knew
nothing
of
them
if
i
had
but
followed
my
heart
and
spoken
to
her
at
once
while
the
warmth
of
my
welcome
and
the
memory
of
the
peril
we
had
undergone
together
were
still
in
heart
matters
might
have
been
very
different
but
i
thought
otherwise
and
that
i
would
be
very
prudent
and
circumspect
knowing
nothing
at
all
of
a
maid
heart
and
her
ways
as
for
cousin
tom
he
had
to
yield
to
me
for
what
else
could
he
do
the
prospect
that
i
opened
before
him
was
a
better
one
than
he
could
get
anywhere
else
he
had
no
opening
at
court
in
spite
of
his
bragging
and
the
protestants
round
about
were
too
wise
in
their
rustic
way
to
engage
themselves
with
a
papist
at
such
a
time
so
there
the
matter
remained
when
i
came
to
my
chamber
it
had
a
very
pleasant
aspect
to
me
the
curtains
were
across
the
windows
a
great
fire
blazed
on
the
hearth
i
had
heard
my
cousin
dolly
footsteps
pass
across
the
landing
before
she
went
to
bed
no
doubt
to
put
more
wood
on
my
bed
was
ready
and
on
the
round
table
in
the
middle
was
a
jug
of
branches
with
some
winter
flowers
it
was
six
months
since
i
had
been
here
and
matters
were
considerably
better
with
me
now
than
they
had
been
then
then
i
was
being
hunted
now
i
was
free
from
all
anxiety
on
that
score
then
i
had
been
going
up
to
london
to
resign
what
little
position
i
had
now
i
was
owing
to
what
i
had
done
in
france
on
a
better
footing
than
ever
more
than
all
i
knew
now
without
any
doubt
at
all
what
my
heart
told
me
of
my
cousin
dolly
and
i
was
here
with
every
liberty
to
commend
my
suit
to
her
before
i
went
to
bed
i
opened
the
little
secret
cupboard
by
my
bed
and
put
into
it
three
or
four
private
papers
i
had
and
amongst
them
that
written
in
cipher
that
i
had
had
from
rumbald
then
i
went
to
bed
and
dreamed
of
dolly
then
began
for
me
a
time
of
great
peace
and
serenity
first
came
christmas
with
its
homely
joys
and
twelfth
night
on
which
we
cut
and
ate
a
great
cake
that
dolly
had
made
then
there
was
the
winter
work
to
be
done
in
preparation
for
the
spring
and
then
spring
itself
with
the
crocuses
sprouting
between
the
joints
of
the
paved
walk
round
the
house
and
the
daffodils
in
the
long
beneath
the
limes
i
write
these
little
things
down
for
it
was
principally
by
these
things
that
i
remember
those
months
and
the
noise
of
the
world
outside
seemed
as
sounds
heard
in
a
dream
i
went
up
to
london
now
and
again
but
not
very
often
and
saw
his
majesty
in
private
twice
and
he
honoured
me
by
asking
my
advice
again
on
certain
french
affairs
but
for
the
time
all
these
things
were
secondary
in
my
mind
to
the
cows
of
hare
street
and
to
how
the
pigs
did
it
is
marvellous
how
men
minds
can
come
down
to
such
matters
and
become
absorbed
in
them
and
let
the
rest
of
the
world
go
hang
i
thought
now
and
again
of
my
mission
from
rome
yet
i
do
not
think
i
was
faithless
to
it
for
there
was
nothing
at
that
time
which
i
could
do
for
the
king
and
he
expressly
had
desired
me
not
to
mix
much
with
the
court
and
so
become
known
the
truth
of
the
matter
was
that
at
this
time
he
was
largely
occupied
with
a
certain
woman
whose
name
had
best
not
be
spoken
and
when
his
majesty
ran
upon
those
lines
he
could
think
of
little
else
i
sent
my
reports
regularly
to
rome
and
the
cardinal
secretary
seemed
satisfied
and
so
therefore
was
i
it
was
with
my
cousin
dolly
precisely
as
i
had
thought
she
was
at
first
very
shy
indeed
going
up
to
her
chamber
early
in
the
evening
so
that
we
had
little
or
no
music
but
relaxing
a
little
as
i
shewed
myself
friendly
without
being
forward
i
caught
her
eyes
on
me
sometimes
and
she
seemed
to
be
appraising
me
i
thought
in
my
stupidity
as
to
whether
she
could
trust
me
not
to
make
love
to
her
but
now
as
i
think
for
a
very
different
reason
and
i
would
see
her
sometimes
as
i
went
out
of
doors
peeping
at
me
for
an
instant
out
of
a
window
it
was
not
however
all
hide
and
seek
we
would
talk
frankly
and
easily
enough
at
times
and
spend
an
hour
or
two
together
or
when
her
father
was
asleep
with
the
greatest
friendliness
and
meanwhile
i
poor
fool
was
thinking
how
wise
and
prudent
i
was
and
what
mighty
progress
i
was
making
by
these
crooked
ways
in
easter
week
we
had
a
great
happiness
so
great
that
it
near
broke
me
down
in
my
resolution
and
i
would
to
god
it
had
at
least
in
certain
moods
i
wish
so
i
was
returning
along
the
barkway
road
from
a
meadow
where
i
had
been
to
look
to
the
new
lambs
in
my
working
dress
when
i
heard
a
horse
coming
behind
me
i
stepped
aside
to
let
him
go
by
when
i
heard
myself
called
my
man
said
the
voice
can
you
tell
me
where
is
jermyn
house
yes
sir
i
said
i
am
going
there
myself
he
was
a
gentleman
very
dark
and
as
i
looked
at
him
i
remembered
him
but
i
could
see
he
did
not
remember
me
and
no
wonder
for
he
had
only
seen
me
once
on
a
very
agitating
occasion
for
a
short
while
he
was
riding
a
very
good
horse
which
was
going
lame
but
without
any
servant
and
he
had
his
valise
strapped
on
the
crupper
in
appearance
he
was
a
on
his
way
to
town
i
determined
to
give
him
a
surprise
as
we
went
along
i
hope
you
are
well
hamerton
i
said
he
gave
a
great
start
at
that
and
looked
at
me
closely
i
do
not
remember
you
he
said
and
why
do
you
call
me
mr
hamerton
i
knew
that
is
not
the
name
you
were
usually
known
by
father
would
you
be
easier
if
i
called
you
mr
young
i
give
it
up
he
said
who
are
you
sir
do
you
remember
a
young
man
i
said
a
year
and
a
half
ago
who
came
into
chiffinch
inner
parlour
on
a
certain
occasion
you
were
sitting
near
his
royal
highness
his
majesty
was
at
the
end
of
the
table
and
by
you
was
father
bedingfeld
who
died
in
prison
in
december
he
smiled
at
me
i
remember
everything
except
the
young
man
he
said
so
you
are
he
and
what
is
your
name
sir
i
told
him
i
am
jermyn
cousin
i
said
and
i
have
been
looking
after
his
lambs
for
him
i
would
there
was
some
spiritual
shepherd
who
would
look
after
us
we
have
not
heard
mass
since
christmas
for
we
had
ridden
over
to
standon
on
that
day
he
seemed
altogether
easier
at
that
why
that
can
be
remedied
he
said
if
you
have
an
altar
stone
and
linen
and
vestments
i
have
all
else
with
me
we
had
these
and
i
told
him
so
then
you
mean
to
lie
at
hare
street
sir
i
said
i
had
hoped
to
do
so
he
said
i
am
come
from
lincolnshire
and
i
was
recommended
to
jermyn
if
i
could
not
get
so
far
as
standon
and
i
can
not
for
my
horse
is
lame
my
cousin
tom
received
the
priest
in
a
surprising
medley
of
emotions
which
he
exhibited
one
by
one
to
me
who
knew
him
so
well
he
was
at
first
plainly
terrified
at
receiving
a
priest
and
a
jesuit
but
presently
recovered
himself
a
little
and
strove
to
remember
that
here
was
one
of
god
priests
who
would
bring
a
blessing
on
the
house
and
said
so
finally
all
else
was
swallowed
up
in
pleasure
or
very
nearly
when
i
took
occasion
on
hamerton
going
upstairs
to
pull
off
his
boots
to
tell
him
that
i
had
seen
this
priest
very
intimate
with
his
royal
highness
the
duke
of
york
and
that
he
had
been
a
near
friend
of
bedingfeld
the
duke
confessor
my
cousin
dorothy
received
him
with
the
reverence
that
pious
maids
can
shew
so
easily
towards
a
priest
she
had
his
chamber
ready
for
him
in
ten
minutes
with
fresh
water
in
the
basin
and
flowers
upon
the
table
she
even
set
out
for
his
entertainment
three
or
four
books
of
devotion
by
his
bedside
and
all
the
time
at
supper
she
never
ceased
to
give
him
attention
drawing
the
men
eyes
to
his
plate
and
cup
continually
hamerton
was
a
very
quiet
gentleman
wonderfully
at
his
ease
at
once
and
never
losing
his
discretion
he
talked
generally
and
pleasantly
at
supper
of
his
road
to
hare
street
and
told
us
an
edifying
story
or
two
of
catholics
at
whose
houses
he
had
lain
on
his
way
from
lincolnshire
these
jesuits
are
wonderful
folk
he
seemed
to
know
the
country
all
over
and
where
were
the
safer
districts
and
where
the
dangerous
i
have
no
doubt
he
could
have
given
me
an
excellent
with
instructions
that
would
take
me
safe
from
london
to
edinburgh
if
i
had
wished
it
and
have
you
never
been
troubled
with
highwaymen
asked
my
cousin
tom
no
jermyn
said
the
priest
except
once
and
that
was
a
catholic
robber
i
thought
he
was
by
the
start
he
gave
when
he
saw
my
crucifix
as
he
was
searching
me
and
taxed
him
with
it
so
the
end
was
he
returned
me
my
valuables
and
took
a
little
sermon
from
my
lips
instead
when
supper
was
over
and
dorothy
had
gone
upstairs
to
make
all
ready
for
mass
on
the
next
morning
hamerton
at
our
questioning
began
to
tell
us
a
little
of
the
state
of
politics
and
what
he
thought
would
happen
and
every
word
that
he
said
came
true
his
grace
of
monmouth
will
be
our
trouble
he
said
the
king
adores
him
and
he
hath
so
far
prevailed
with
his
majesty
as
to
get
the
duke
of
york
sent
twice
to
scotland
i
think
few
folk
understand
what
feeling
there
is
in
the
country
for
the
protestant
duke
it
was
through
my
lord
shaftesbury
who
is
behind
him
that
his
royal
highness
was
actually
sent
away
for
monmouth
could
do
nothing
without
him
and
i
have
no
kind
of
doubt
that
he
has
further
schemes
in
his
mind
too
this
was
all
fulfilled
a
couple
of
months
later
as
i
remembered
when
the
time
came
by
my
lord
shaftesbury
actually
presenting
james
name
as
that
of
a
recusant
before
the
grand
jury
of
middlesex
but
the
judges
dismissed
the
jury
immediately
and
you
think
father
asked
my
cousin
tom
very
solemnly
that
these
seditions
will
lead
to
trouble
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
at
all
said
he
the
country
especially
london
is
full
of
disaffection
their
demonstration
last
year
did
a
deal
to
stir
it
up
the
duke
of
york
is
back
now
against
my
advice
but
i
have
no
doubt
he
will
have
to
go
on
his
travels
again
were
his
majesty
to
die
now
quod
deus
avertat
i
do
not
know
how
we
should
stand
hamerton
took
occasion
to
ask
me
that
night
when
we
were
alone
for
a
minute
or
two
what
i
was
doing
in
the
country
i
remember
you
perfectly
now
said
he
father
whitbread
spoke
to
me
of
you
besides
i
told
him
that
i
had
nothing
to
do
in
town
and
with
his
consent
was
lying
hid
for
a
little
in
order
that
what
little
was
known
of
me
might
be
forgotten
again
well
i
suppose
you
are
wise
he
said
and
that
you
will
be
able
to
do
more
hereafter
but
the
time
will
come
presently
when
we
shall
all
be
needed
it
was
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
ask
him
if
he
could
read
cipher
and
to
shew
him
my
paper
reminded
of
it
by
his
talk
of
disaffection
but
my
cousin
tom
came
back
at
that
moment
and
i
put
it
off
and
i
presently
forgot
it
again
the
memory
of
the
mass
that
we
heard
next
morning
will
never
leave
me
for
it
was
the
first
time
that
i
had
heard
it
in
the
house
we
used
the
long
attic
for
fear
of
disturbance
and
had
a
man
posted
beneath
for
it
was
still
death
for
a
priest
to
say
mass
in
england
all
the
servants
that
were
catholics
were
there
and
all
i
think
went
to
the
sacraments
hamerton
heard
confessions
before
the
mass
began
the
north
end
of
the
attic
had
been
prepared
by
dolly
and
her
maid
and
looked
very
pretty
and
fine
a
couple
of
men
had
carried
up
a
great
low
press
that
had
the
instruments
of
the
passion
painted
upon
its
panels
and
this
served
for
an
altar
behind
it
dolly
had
put
up
a
hanging
from
downstairs
that
was
of
abraham
offering
isaac
and
had
set
upon
the
altar
a
pair
of
silver
candlesticks
from
the
parlour
and
a
little
standing
crucifix
with
jugs
of
country
flowers
between
the
candlesticks
and
the
cross
she
had
laid
too
as
a
a
turkey
rug
that
came
too
from
the
parlour
and
had
put
a
little
table
to
serve
as
a
credence
hamerton
had
with
him
little
made
for
travelling
with
a
cup
that
unscrewed
from
the
stem
and
every
other
necessary
except
what
he
asked
us
to
provide
it
is
the
experience
of
everyone
i
think
that
mass
differs
from
mass
as
a
star
in
the
apostle
words
differs
from
another
star
in
glory
i
do
not
mean
in
its
essential
effects
for
that
is
the
same
always
but
in
the
devotion
which
it
arouses
in
those
that
hear
it
this
mass
then
seemed
to
me
like
scarcely
any
other
that
i
had
ever
heard
except
perhaps
that
at
which
i
received
my
first
communion
in
the
country
church
in
france
hamerton
said
it
with
great
deliberation
and
recollection
and
as
my
cousin
tom
served
him
as
a
host
should
i
was
not
distracted
by
anything
my
cousin
dolly
and
i
kneeled
side
by
side
in
front
and
again
side
by
side
to
receive
holy
communion
i
was
in
a
kind
of
ecstasy
of
delight
and
not
i
think
unworthily
for
though
much
of
my
delight
came
from
being
there
with
my
cousin
and
receiving
our
lord
body
with
her
i
do
not
think
that
is
any
dishonour
to
god
whom
we
must
love
first
of
all
to
find
a
great
joy
in
loving
him
in
the
company
of
those
we
love
purely
and
uprightly
so
at
least
it
seems
to
me
hamerton
told
us
he
must
be
riding
very
early
and
not
much
after
seven
we
stood
at
the
gate
to
bid
him
farewell
i
made
my
man
james
go
with
him
so
far
as
ware
to
set
him
on
his
road
though
the
priest
begged
me
not
to
trouble
myself
when
i
came
back
to
the
house
i
was
in
a
torment
of
indecision
as
to
whether
this
would
not
be
the
best
occasion
i
could
ever
find
of
telling
my
cousin
dorothy
all
that
was
in
my
heart
in
her
regard
and
i
even
went
into
the
great
chamber
after
her
still
undecided
but
her
manner
prevented
me
for
i
thought
i
saw
in
her
something
of
a
return
of
that
same
shyness
which
she
had
shewed
to
me
when
i
had
come
last
time
back
to
hare
street
and
i
went
out
again
without
saying
one
word
except
of
the
priest
visit
and
of
what
a
good
man
he
seemed
even
then
i
think
if
i
had
spoken
matters
might
have
taken
a
very
different
course
but
whether
through
god
appointment
or
my
own
diffidence
this
was
not
to
be
and
again
i
said
nothing
to
her
chapter
iv
our
next
adventure
not
unlike
the
last
exteriorly
was
very
different
from
it
interiorly
and
led
to
very
strange
results
in
the
event
it
came
about
in
this
way
it
was
in
may
that
hamerton
had
come
to
us
for
easter
that
year
fell
in
that
month
and
the
weather
after
that
which
had
been
very
bitter
in
the
winter
with
so
much
snow
as
i
never
saw
before
but
clearer
about
eastertime
fell
very
wet
and
stormy
again
in
june
it
was
on
a
thursday
evening
in
the
first
week
in
june
that
the
bad
weather
set
in
with
a
violent
storm
of
rain
and
a
high
wind
we
sat
in
the
great
chamber
after
supper
and
had
some
music
as
usual
and
between
the
music
we
listened
to
the
gusts
of
wind
and
the
rattle
of
the
rain
which
made
so
great
a
noise
that
dolly
said
that
it
was
no
use
for
her
to
go
to
bed
yet
for
that
she
would
not
sleep
if
she
went
her
maid
went
to
bed
and
we
three
sat
talking
till
nearly
ten
which
is
very
late
for
the
country
where
men
rise
at
four
the
wind
made
such
a
noise
that
we
heard
nothing
of
the
approach
to
the
house
and
the
first
that
we
knew
of
anyone
coming
was
a
hammering
at
the
door
why
who
is
that
said
i
that
comes
so
late
i
could
see
that
my
cousin
tom
did
not
like
it
for
his
face
shewed
it
i
suppose
it
was
the
memory
of
that
other
time
when
the
hammering
came
so
i
said
nothing
but
went
myself
to
the
outer
door
and
unbolted
it
a
fellow
stood
there
in
a
great
but
i
could
see
he
wore
some
kind
of
a
livery
beneath
well
i
said
what
do
you
want
he
saw
that
i
was
a
gentleman
by
my
dress
and
he
answered
me
very
civilly
my
master
is
benighted
sir
said
he
and
he
bid
me
come
and
ask
whether
he
might
lie
here
there
is
no
inn
in
the
place
why
who
is
your
master
i
asked
he
did
not
seem
to
hear
my
question
for
he
went
on
immediately
there
are
only
five
of
the
party
sir
he
said
two
gentlemen
and
three
servants
i
saw
that
my
cousin
tom
was
behind
me
now
and
that
dolly
was
looking
from
the
door
of
the
great
chamber
you
have
not
yet
told
us
i
said
what
your
master
name
is
i
think
sir
he
had
best
answer
that
said
the
fellow
now
this
might
very
well
be
a
catholic
and
perhaps
an
important
person
who
had
heard
of
jermyn
but
did
not
wish
to
advertise
who
himself
was
i
looked
at
my
cousin
tom
and
thought
from
his
look
that
the
same
thought
had
come
to
him
well
cousin
i
said
they
had
best
come
in
he
said
shortly
dolly
rouse
some
of
the
servants
they
will
want
supper
i
suppose
he
nodded
to
the
man
who
went
back
immediately
and
a
minute
later
two
gentlemen
came
up
the
flagged
path
also
in
great
cloaks
that
appeared
soaked
with
the
rain
by
god
sir
said
the
first
of
them
we
are
grateful
to
you
this
is
a
wild
night
my
cousin
tom
said
something
civil
and
when
the
door
was
shut
helped
this
man
off
with
his
cloak
while
i
helped
the
other
the
former
was
explaining
all
the
while
how
they
were
on
their
way
to
town
from
newmarket
and
how
they
had
become
bogged
a
little
after
barkway
losing
their
road
in
the
darkness
they
had
intended
to
push
on
to
waltham
cross
he
said
or
ware
at
the
least
and
lie
there
he
spoke
with
a
merry
easy
air
that
shewed
him
for
a
and
pleasant
fellow
my
own
man
said
nothing
but
left
it
all
to
the
other
when
i
turned
to
see
the
one
who
spoke
i
was
more
surprised
than
ever
in
all
my
life
before
for
it
was
no
other
than
the
duke
of
monmouth
himself
he
looked
a
shade
older
than
when
i
had
last
seen
him
in
the
park
above
a
year
ago
but
he
was
the
very
same
and
i
could
not
mistake
him
as
for
me
he
would
not
know
me
from
adam
for
he
had
never
spoken
with
me
in
all
his
life
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
as
to
whether
i
should
make
to
recognize
him
or
not
but
he
saved
me
the
trouble
for
as
i
followed
the
others
into
the
great
chamber
he
was
already
speaking
it
is
very
good
of
you
jermyn
he
said
to
receive
us
like
this
my
name
is
morton
and
my
friend
here
atkins
you
can
put
us
where
you
will
on
the
floor
if
you
have
no
other
place
we
can
do
better
than
that
sir
said
tom
there
is
only
my
daughter
here
and
mallock
my
cousin
my
daughter
is
gone
to
call
the
servants
the
duke
looked
very
handsome
and
princely
as
he
stood
on
the
hearth
although
there
was
no
fire
and
surveyed
the
room
he
was
in
a
dark
blue
darker
than
it
should
be
upon
the
shoulders
with
the
rain
that
had
soaked
through
his
cloak
but
it
was
of
the
colour
of
his
eyes
that
were
very
fine
and
attractive
and
he
wore
his
own
hair
the
other
man
looked
pretty
mean
beside
him
and
yet
he
was
not
he
was
a
fair
man
too
with
a
rosy
face
in
a
buff
suit
we
can
manage
two
changes
of
clothes
morton
went
on
my
cousin
tom
if
you
fear
to
take
a
cold
or
you
can
sup
immediately
as
you
will
why
jermyn
i
think
we
will
sup
first
and
go
to
bed
afterwards
the
clothes
can
be
dried
no
doubt
before
morning
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
he
spoke
as
one
born
to
command
and
with
a
kind
of
easy
condescension
too
and
certainly
this
had
its
effect
upon
poor
tom
for
he
was
all
eagerness
and
welcome
who
just
now
had
been
a
shade
surly
he
was
beginning
to
say
that
it
was
for
his
guests
to
choose
when
my
cousin
dolly
came
in
suddenly
through
the
open
door
why
here
is
my
little
maid
gentlemen
he
said
and
dolly
did
her
reverence
now
i
had
in
my
mind
no
thought
of
jealousy
at
all
and
yet
when
i
saw
how
the
duke
bowed
to
my
cousin
i
am
bound
to
say
that
a
touch
of
it
pierced
me
like
a
dart
there
and
gone
again
i
thought
but
it
had
been
there
i
thought
how
few
gentlemen
poor
dolly
saw
down
here
in
hare
street
beyond
the
parson
and
he
was
a
man
who
would
go
out
before
the
pudding
in
a
great
house
and
marry
the
lady
maid
there
was
scarce
one
who
might
write
esquire
after
his
name
and
the
breeding
of
most
of
the
squires
was
mostly
rustical
as
for
her
she
did
her
reverence
very
prettily
without
a
trace
of
the
country
in
it
and
strange
to
say
her
manner
seemed
to
change
i
mean
by
that
that
she
seemed
wholly
at
her
ease
in
this
new
kind
of
company
fully
as
much
as
with
her
maids
you
have
had
a
very
wet
ride
sir
she
said
without
any
sign
of
confusion
or
shyness
the
maids
are
kindling
a
fire
in
the
kitchen
to
dry
your
clothes
before
morning
and
your
men
shall
have
beds
in
the
attic
the
duke
made
a
pretty
answer
which
she
took
as
prettily
and
a
cold
supper
shall
be
in
immediately
she
said
then
my
cousin
tom
must
needs
begin
upon
the
maid
as
if
she
were
a
child
or
idiotic
and
say
what
a
good
housekeeper
his
little
maid
was
to
him
and
how
she
could
do
so
many
things
and
the
duke
took
it
all
with
courtesy
yet
did
not
encourage
it
as
if
he
understood
her
ways
better
than
her
father
did
which
was
very
likely
true
enough
and
you
come
up
to
london
mistress
he
said
no
doubt
with
a
look
at
her
dress
that
was
not
at
all
insolent
and
yet
very
plain
and
it
was
indeed
a
pretty
good
one
and
i
remember
it
very
well
it
was
cut
like
a
french
sac
a
fashion
that
had
first
come
in
about
ten
years
before
and
still
lasted
and
was
a
little
lower
at
the
throat
than
many
that
she
wore
it
was
of
a
brownish
kind
of
yellow
of
which
i
do
not
know
the
name
and
had
white
lace
to
it
and
silver
lace
on
the
bodice
she
was
sunburnt
again
but
not
too
much
as
i
had
first
seen
her
and
her
blue
eyes
looked
very
bright
in
her
face
and
she
wore
a
ring
on
either
hand
as
she
usually
did
in
the
evening
and
had
her
little
pearls
round
her
neck
it
was
strange
to
me
how
i
observed
all
this
so
soon
as
the
duke
had
drawn
attention
to
it
whereas
i
had
not
observed
it
particularly
before
wen
we
went
into
supper
it
was
the
same
with
the
duke
and
her
he
behaved
to
her
with
the
greatest
deference
yet
not
at
all
exaggerated
so
as
to
be
in
the
least
insolent
he
treated
her
it
appeared
to
me
as
he
would
have
treated
one
of
his
own
ladies
though
there
had
been
every
excuse
especially
with
cousin
tom
way
of
speaking
to
her
and
the
deep
country
we
were
in
if
he
had
not
noticed
her
at
all
atkins
as
he
called
himself
followed
suit
but
said
very
little
once
when
the
dishes
had
to
be
taken
away
and
dolly
rose
to
do
it
before
i
could
move
my
cousin
tom
of
course
sat
there
like
a
dummy
i
observed
the
duke
make
a
little
movement
with
his
eyes
towards
atkins
who
immediately
rose
up
and
did
it
for
her
the
effect
of
all
this
upon
me
was
to
make
me
do
my
best
in
talk
but
it
was
not
very
easy
without
betraying
that
i
knew
more
of
the
court
than
might
be
supposed
but
the
duke
outdid
me
every
time
he
listened
with
the
greatest
courtesy
and
then
said
something
a
little
better
i
think
i
have
never
seen
a
man
do
better
but
it
was
always
so
with
him
five
years
later
he
won
the
hearts
of
all
the
drapers
in
taunton
in
that
terrible
enterprise
of
his
besides
ranging
on
his
side
some
of
the
noblest
blood
in
england
young
maids
in
that
town
gave
him
a
bible
and
a
pair
of
colours
worked
by
their
hands
and
young
maids
it
was
said
went
away
after
it
in
love
with
him
he
did
not
prove
himself
very
much
of
a
hero
in
the
field
but
from
his
manner
in
company
one
could
never
have
guessed
at
that
he
had
all
the
bearing
of
a
prince
and
all
the
charm
of
a
boy
with
it
my
cousin
tom
said
something
when
supper
was
ending
about
dolly
skill
in
music
and
how
she
and
her
maid
sang
together
may
we
not
hear
it
for
ourselves
asked
the
duke
but
you
are
wet
sir
said
my
cousin
tom
the
duke
smiled
i
shall
not
think
of
that
sir
he
said
if
mistress
dorothy
will
sing
to
us
well
so
it
was
settled
the
maid
was
in
the
kitchen
and
was
presently
fetched
and
she
and
dolly
sang
together
once
or
twice
though
it
was
now
after
eleven
they
sang
mr
wise
go
perjured
man
i
remember
again
and
then
grabu
song
upon
peace
the
duke
sat
still
in
the
great
chair
shading
his
eyes
from
the
candlelight
and
watching
my
cousin
dolly
and
once
when
my
cousin
tom
broke
in
upon
the
second
song
with
something
he
had
just
thought
of
to
say
he
put
him
aside
with
a
gesture
very
royal
and
commanding
and
yet
void
of
offence
until
the
song
was
done
i
beg
your
pardon
jermyn
he
said
a
moment
afterwards
but
i
have
never
been
so
entranced
what
was
it
that
you
wished
to
say
as
dolly
came
towards
him
he
stood
up
mistress
dorothy
he
said
you
have
given
us
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
and
he
said
this
with
so
much
gravity
and
feeling
that
she
flushed
it
was
the
first
evident
sign
she
had
given
that
he
had
pleased
her
and
i
mean
it
he
went
on
when
i
say
it
is
a
pity
you
do
not
come
to
town
more
often
such
singing
as
that
should
have
a
larger
audience
than
the
two
or
three
you
have
had
dolly
smiled
at
him
thank
you
sir
she
said
but
i
know
my
place
better
than
that
this
was
all
a
little
bitter
to
me
for
by
this
time
a
wild
kind
of
jealousy
had
risen
again
in
me
which
i
knew
to
be
unreasonable
and
yet
could
not
check
it
was
true
that
i
myself
took
the
greatest
pains
never
to
forget
my
manners
but
i
knew
very
well
that
novelty
has
a
pleasantness
all
of
its
own
and
the
novelty
of
such
company
as
this
charged
with
the
peculiar
charm
of
the
duke
manner
must
surely
i
thought
have
its
effect
upon
her
well
said
he
i
could
spend
all
night
in
this
chamber
with
such
music
but
i
must
not
keep
mistress
dorothy
from
her
sleep
another
moment
he
kissed
her
fingers
with
the
greatest
grace
and
then
bowed
by
the
door
as
she
went
out
when
we
had
taken
them
to
the
great
that
was
as
large
very
nearly
as
the
great
chamber
and
over
it
and
bidden
them
my
cousin
tom
remembered
that
we
had
forgotten
to
ask
morton
at
what
time
he
must
ride
in
the
morning
so
i
went
back
again
to
ask
i
stayed
at
the
door
for
one
instant
after
knocking
for
it
seemed
they
had
not
heard
me
and
in
that
little
interval
i
heard
the
duke
voice
within
very
distinct
a
damned
pretty
wench
he
cried
we
must
and
at
that
i
opened
the
door
and
went
in
my
jealousy
suddenly
flaming
up
again
so
that
i
lost
my
wits
they
stared
at
me
in
astonishment
the
duke
already
was
stripped
to
his
shirt
by
one
of
the
beds
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
said
but
at
what
hour
will
your
grace
have
the
horses
atkins
wheeled
round
full
upon
me
and
the
duke
mouth
opened
a
little
then
the
duke
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
by
god
sir
he
said
you
have
detected
us
how
long
have
you
known
it
from
the
moment
your
grace
took
off
your
hat
i
said
he
laughed
again
highly
and
merrily
well
no
harm
is
done
he
said
we
took
other
names
to
make
matters
easier
for
all
you
have
told
mr
jermyn
no
sir
i
said
i
beg
of
you
not
to
do
so
he
said
it
will
spoil
all
nor
mistress
dorothy
it
is
far
easier
to
do
without
ceremony
now
and
again
i
bowed
again
but
i
said
nothing
then
you
may
as
well
know
said
the
duke
that
atkins
is
none
other
than
my
lord
of
essex
we
have
been
at
newmarket
together
i
bowed
to
my
lord
and
he
to
me
well
the
horses
said
monmouth
at
eight
if
you
please
i
said
nothing
to
tom
for
i
was
very
uncertain
what
to
do
and
though
i
was
mad
with
anger
at
what
i
had
heard
the
duke
say
as
i
waited
at
the
door
though
now
i
can
not
say
that
there
was
any
great
harm
in
the
words
themselves
i
still
kept
my
wits
enough
to
know
that
i
was
too
angry
to
judge
fairly
i
lay
awake
a
long
time
that
night
turning
from
side
to
side
after
that
i
had
heard
the
wet
clothes
of
our
guests
carried
downstairs
to
be
dried
by
morning
before
the
fire
it
was
all
a
mighty
innocent
matter
so
far
as
it
had
gone
but
i
would
not
see
that
i
told
myself
that
a
man
of
the
duke
quality
should
not
come
to
a
little
under
an
even
if
he
had
been
bogged
ten
times
over
that
he
should
not
make
pretty
speeches
to
a
country
maid
and
kiss
her
fingers
and
hold
open
the
door
for
her
even
though
all
these
things
or
some
of
them
were
just
what
i
had
done
myself
frankly
i
understand
now
that
no
harm
was
meant
that
every
word
the
duke
had
said
was
true
and
that
it
was
but
natural
for
him
to
try
to
please
all
across
whom
he
came
but
i
would
not
see
it
at
the
time
on
the
next
morning
when
i
came
downstairs
early
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
cousin
dorothy
was
herself
downstairs
too
early
for
mere
good
manners
the
guests
were
not
yet
stirring
yet
the
maids
were
up
and
the
ale
set
out
in
the
and
the
smell
of
hot
came
from
the
kitchen
there
were
flowers
also
upon
the
table
and
my
cousin
was
in
a
pretty
brown
dress
of
hers
that
she
did
not
wear
very
often
i
looked
upon
her
rather
harshly
and
i
think
she
observed
it
for
she
said
nothing
to
me
as
she
went
about
her
business
i
went
out
into
the
to
see
the
horses
and
found
my
cousin
tom
there
already
admiring
them
and
indeed
they
were
fine
especially
a
great
dappled
grey
that
was
stamping
under
the
brush
of
the
fellow
who
had
first
knocked
at
our
door
last
night
that
is
morton
horse
i
suppose
said
tom
the
man
who
was
grooming
him
did
not
speak
and
tom
repeated
his
question
yes
sir
said
the
man
with
a
queer
look
which
i
understood
though
tom
did
not
this
is
mr
morton
and
the
chestnut
is
mr
atkins
asked
my
cousin
just
so
sir
atkins
said
the
man
with
the
corners
of
his
mouth
twitching
the
grinning
ape
as
i
thought
him
very
nearly
set
me
off
into
saying
that
i
knew
all
about
it
and
that
the
yellow
was
the
colour
the
duke
of
monmouth
used
always
but
i
did
not
it
appeared
to
me
then
the
worst
of
manners
that
these
personages
should
come
and
make
a
mock
of
so
that
even
the
servants
laughed
at
us
our
guests
were
downstairs
when
i
came
in
again
and
talking
very
merrily
to
my
cousin
dorothy
who
was
as
much
at
her
ease
as
last
night
the
duke
sneezed
once
or
twice
you
have
taken
a
cold
sir
said
dolly
it
was
in
a
good
cause
he
said
and
sneezed
again
said
i
he
gave
me
a
quick
look
astonished
i
suppose
that
a
rustic
should
know
the
italian
ways
said
he
smiling
you
have
been
in
italy
mr
mallock
oh
i
have
been
everywhere
i
said
with
a
foolish
idea
of
making
him
respect
me
when
they
rode
away
at
last
we
all
stood
at
the
gate
to
watch
them
go
the
storm
had
cleared
away
wonderfully
and
the
air
was
fresh
and
summerlike
and
ten
thousand
jewels
sparkled
on
the
limes
they
made
a
very
gallant
cavalcade
the
horses
had
recovered
from
their
weariness
for
they
were
finely
bred
all
five
of
them
and
the
duke
horse
especially
was
full
of
spirit
and
curvetted
a
little
with
pleasure
and
the
strength
of
our
corn
as
he
went
along
the
servants
liveries
too
were
gay
and
pleasant
to
the
eye
they
were
not
the
duke
own
liveries
for
when
he
went
about
outside
town
he
used
a
plainer
sort
and
the
duke
dark
blue
with
his
fair
curls
and
his
great
hat
which
he
waved
as
he
went
and
my
lord
essex
spruce
figure
in
his
buff
all
made
a
very
pretty
picture
as
they
went
up
the
village
street
it
was
this
i
think
and
my
cousin
dolly
silence
as
she
looked
after
them
that
determined
me
and
as
we
three
went
back
again
up
the
flagged
path
to
the
house
and
the
servants
round
again
to
the
yard
i
spoke
cousin
tom
i
said
do
you
wish
to
know
who
our
guests
were
he
looked
at
me
in
astonishment
and
my
cousin
dolly
too
morton
is
the
duke
of
monmouth
i
said
and
atkins
my
lord
essex
chapter
v
it
was
a
long
time
before
my
cousin
tom
recovered
from
his
astonishment
and
his
pleasure
at
having
entertained
such
personages
in
his
house
he
told
me
of
course
presently
when
he
had
had
time
to
think
of
it
that
he
had
guessed
it
all
along
but
had
understood
that
his
grace
wished
to
be
and
i
suppose
at
last
he
came
to
believe
it
he
would
fall
suddenly
musing
in
the
evenings
and
i
would
know
what
he
was
thinking
of
and
it
was
piteously
amusing
to
see
how
one
night
again
not
long
after
he
rose
and
ran
to
the
door
when
a
drunken
man
knocked
upon
it
and
what
ill
words
he
gave
him
when
he
saw
who
it
was
his
was
a
mind
and
i
think
he
could
not
have
formed
the
project
which
he
afterwards
carried
out
while
i
was
with
him
or
he
must
have
let
it
out
to
me
it
was
a
little
piteous
too
to
see
with
what
avidity
he
seized
upon
any
news
of
the
duke
and
how
his
natural
inclinations
and
those
consonant
with
his
religion
strove
with
his
loyalty
to
a
bastard
a
week
or
two
later
we
had
news
of
the
attempt
made
by
my
lord
shaftesbury
to
injure
the
duke
of
york
cause
by
presenting
his
name
as
that
of
a
recusant
to
the
middlesex
grand
jury
it
was
a
mighty
bold
thing
to
do
and
though
the
attempt
failed
so
far
as
that
the
judges
dismissed
the
jury
while
they
were
still
deliberating
it
shewed
how
little
my
lord
feared
the
duke
or
his
majesty
and
how
much
resolved
he
was
to
establish
if
he
could
the
protestant
succession
and
the
duke
of
monmouth
pretended
claim
to
it
a
deal
of
nonsense
too
was
talked
at
this
time
of
how
the
duke
was
truly
legitimate
and
how
mistress
lucy
walters
had
been
secretly
married
to
the
king
before
ever
poor
queen
catherine
had
been
heard
of
and
the
proofs
of
all
this
it
was
reported
were
in
a
certain
black
box
that
no
one
had
ever
set
eyes
on
and
the
matter
became
so
much
a
thing
of
ridicule
that
once
at
the
play
i
think
when
one
of
the
actors
carried
on
a
black
box
there
was
a
roar
of
laughter
and
jeering
from
the
pit
it
was
wonderful
to
hear
my
cousin
tom
hold
forth
upon
the
situation
one
evening
in
september
two
months
after
our
adventure
of
the
coming
after
a
long
silence
he
made
a
little
discourse
upon
it
all
i
should
not
be
surprised
said
he
if
there
was
more
in
the
tale
than
most
men
think
it
is
not
likely
that
the
proofs
of
the
marriage
would
be
easy
to
come
by
in
such
a
case
for
mistress
walters
whom
i
think
i
once
saw
at
tunbridge
wells
was
not
at
all
of
the
position
even
by
blood
and
it
is
less
likely
that
his
majesty
who
was
but
a
very
young
man
at
that
time
would
have
stood
out
against
her
when
she
wished
marriage
besides
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
knew
her
long
before
there
was
any
prospect
of
his
coming
to
the
throne
then
too
there
has
always
appeared
to
my
mind
at
least
something
in
the
bearing
and
carriage
that
it
would
be
very
hard
for
a
bastard
to
have
he
has
a
very
princely
air
to
such
talk
as
this
i
would
make
no
answer
but
i
would
watch
my
cousin
dorothy
face
and
think
that
i
read
there
something
that
i
did
not
like
an
interest
that
she
should
not
feel
and
after
a
pause
my
cousin
tom
would
proceed
in
his
conjectures
it
was
on
the
day
following
this
particular
discourse
which
i
remember
very
well
for
my
jealousy
had
so
much
worked
up
that
i
was
very
near
breaking
my
resolution
and
telling
my
cousin
dolly
all
that
was
in
my
heart
that
a
letter
came
for
me
from
chiffinch
so
significant
that
i
will
write
down
some
sentences
of
it
his
majesty
bids
me
to
write
to
you
to
come
up
to
town
again
for
a
few
days
he
thinks
that
you
may
perhaps
be
of
some
use
with
his
royal
highness
to
urge
him
to
go
back
to
scotland
again
which
at
present
he
vows
that
he
will
not
do
his
majesty
is
aware
that
the
duke
scarcely
knows
you
at
all
yet
he
tells
me
to
say
this
and
that
i
will
explain
to
you
when
you
come
how
you
can
be
of
service
there
will
be
a
deal
of
trouble
this
autumn
the
parliament
is
to
meet
in
october
and
will
be
in
a
very
it
is
thought
there
was
a
little
more
of
this
sort
and
then
came
a
sentence
or
two
that
roused
my
anger
i
have
heard
much
here
of
your
entertainment
of
the
duke
of
monmouth
and
of
what
a
pretty
girl
your
cousin
is
his
majesty
laughed
very
much
when
he
heard
of
it
and
swears
that
he
suspects
you
of
going
over
to
the
protestant
side
after
all
the
duke
knows
nothing
of
what
you
are
or
of
anything
you
have
done
but
he
has
talked
freely
of
his
entertainment
at
hare
street
thinking
it
i
suppose
to
be
a
protestant
house
in
public
the
king
has
had
nothing
to
say
to
him
but
he
loves
him
as
much
as
ever
and
would
not
i
think
be
very
sorry
in
his
heart
though
he
never
says
so
if
he
were
to
be
declared
legitimate
this
made
me
angry
then
for
what
the
letter
said
as
to
the
duke
of
monmouth
talk
and
it
disconcerted
me
too
for
if
the
king
himself
were
to
join
the
popular
party
there
would
be
little
hope
of
the
catholic
succession
the
duchess
of
portsmouth
also
i
had
heard
had
lately
become
of
that
side
and
i
dared
say
it
was
she
who
had
talked
his
majesty
round
now
my
cousin
tom
knew
that
i
had
had
this
letter
for
he
had
seen
the
courier
bring
it
but
he
did
not
know
from
whom
it
came
and
as
already
he
was
a
little
suspicious
i
thought
of
what
i
did
in
town
i
thought
it
best
to
tell
him
that
it
was
from
a
friend
at
court
and
what
it
said
as
to
the
duke
of
monmouth
talk
hoping
that
this
perhaps
might
offend
him
against
the
duke
but
it
had
the
very
opposite
effect
much
to
my
discomfiture
his
grace
says
that
does
he
he
said
smiling
i
am
sure
it
is
very
courteous
of
him
to
remember
his
poor
entertainment
and
dolly
coming
in
at
this
instant
he
told
her
too
what
the
duke
had
said
hear
what
the
duke
of
monmouth
hath
been
saying
my
dear
he
says
you
are
a
mighty
pretty
girl
and
dolly
greatly
to
my
astonishment
did
not
seem
displeased
as
soon
as
she
had
heard
the
tale
for
she
laughed
and
said
nothing
as
i
rode
up
to
london
next
day
in
answer
to
my
summons
i
was
wondering
how
in
the
world
i
could
be
of
service
to
the
duke
of
york
as
chiffinch
had
said
i
knew
next
to
nothing
of
him
nor
he
of
me
but
when
i
was
gone
round
to
the
page
rooms
the
morning
after
i
came
he
told
me
something
of
the
reasons
for
which
i
had
been
summoned
such
jesuits
as
are
left
he
said
and
the
duke
confessor
among
them
seem
all
of
opinion
that
the
duke
had
best
remain
in
london
and
fight
it
out
we
hear
without
a
doubt
that
my
lord
shaftesbury
who
seems
most
desperate
will
bring
in
the
exclusion
bill
again
this
session
and
the
priests
say
that
it
is
best
for
his
royal
highness
to
be
here
and
to
plead
again
for
himself
as
he
did
so
well
two
years
ago
his
majesty
on
the
other
hand
is
honestly
of
opinion
and
i
would
sooner
trust
to
his
foresight
than
to
all
the
jesuits
in
the
world
that
he
himself
can
fight
better
for
his
brother
if
that
brother
be
in
scotland
for
out
of
sight
out
of
mind
and
he
desires
you
as
a
catholic
yet
not
a
priest
to
go
and
talk
to
the
duke
on
that
side
he
hath
sent
half
a
dozen
to
him
already
and
since
he
knows
that
the
duke
is
aware
of
what
you
have
done
in
france
he
thinks
that
your
word
may
tip
the
balance
for
the
duke
i
think
is
in
two
minds
beneath
all
his
protestations
for
myself
i
was
of
his
majesty
opinion
for
the
sight
of
the
duke
irritated
folk
who
had
not
yet
forgotten
the
oates
plot
and
i
consented
very
willingly
to
go
and
see
him
i
was
astonished
to
find
that
by
now
i
had
really
become
something
of
a
personage
myself
amongst
those
few
who
had
heard
what
i
had
done
in
france
and
i
was
received
by
his
royal
highness
in
his
lodgings
after
supper
that
evening
with
a
very
different
air
from
that
which
he
had
when
i
had
last
spoken
with
him
the
duke
was
pacing
up
and
down
his
closet
when
i
came
in
and
turned
to
me
with
a
very
friendly
manner
mallock
he
said
when
i
had
saluted
him
and
was
sat
down
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
his
majesty
has
told
me
all
that
you
have
done
and
has
urged
me
to
see
you
as
you
are
devoted
as
i
know
to
the
catholic
cause
and
know
the
world
too
and
men
minds
do
you
think
i
should
go
or
stay
sir
i
said
my
opinion
is
that
you
should
go
there
is
a
quantity
of
disaffection
in
town
i
have
met
with
a
good
deal
of
it
myself
if
your
royal
highness
is
to
be
seen
continually
going
about
that
disaffection
will
be
kept
alive
men
are
astonishingly
stupid
they
act
largely
upon
that
which
they
see
not
on
that
which
they
know
and
by
going
to
scotland
you
will
meet
them
both
ways
they
will
not
see
your
highness
at
all
and
all
that
they
will
know
of
you
is
that
you
are
doing
the
king
work
and
helping
the
whole
kingdom
in
edinburgh
but
they
say
i
torture
folks
there
said
the
duke
they
say
so
sir
they
will
say
anything
but
not
a
reasonable
man
believes
it
it
was
true
indeed
that
such
gossip
went
about
but
the
substance
of
it
was
ridiculous
good
fighters
do
not
torture
and
no
one
denied
to
the
duke
the
highest
pitch
of
personal
courage
he
had
fought
with
the
greatest
gallantry
against
the
dutch
he
said
nothing
to
that
but
sat
brooding
his
closet
was
a
very
magnificent
chamber
but
not
so
magnificent
as
he
who
sat
in
it
he
was
but
just
come
from
supper
and
wore
his
orders
on
his
coat
but
all
his
dress
could
not
distract
those
who
looked
at
him
from
that
kingly
stuart
face
that
he
had
he
was
perhaps
the
heaviest
looking
of
them
all
with
not
a
tithe
of
monmouth
brilliant
charm
or
the
king
melancholy
power
yet
he
too
had
the
air
of
command
and
more
than
a
touch
of
that
strange
romance
which
they
all
had
until
that
blood
is
diluted
down
to
nothing
i
think
that
a
stuart
will
always
find
men
to
love
and
to
die
for
him
but
it
was
stuart
against
stuart
this
time
so
who
could
tell
with
whom
the
victory
would
lie
so
i
was
thinking
to
myself
when
suddenly
the
duke
looked
up
mallock
he
said
i
hear
that
you
have
a
very
persuasive
manner
with
both
men
and
women
there
is
an
exceedingly
difficult
commission
which
i
wish
you
would
execute
for
me
you
have
spoken
with
the
duchess
of
portsmouth
never
sir
i
said
i
have
seen
her
grace
in
the
park
only
well
she
has
thrown
her
weight
against
me
with
the
king
god
knows
why
but
i
wonder
you
have
not
met
her
sir
i
never
go
to
court
by
his
majesty
wish
yes
he
said
but
her
grace
is
the
king
chief
agent
in
his
french
affairs
and
you
are
in
them
too
i
hear
but
that
is
his
majesty
way
he
uses
each
singly
and
never
two
together
if
he
can
help
it
this
was
perfectly
true
and
explained
a
good
deal
to
me
i
had
heard
much
of
the
duchess
in
france
but
nothing
at
all
of
her
from
the
king
well
continued
the
duke
i
wish
you
would
see
her
for
me
mallock
and
try
to
get
from
her
why
she
is
so
hot
against
me
she
is
a
catholic
as
you
are
and
she
should
not
be
so
but
she
is
all
on
fire
for
monmouth
and
the
protestant
succession
and
she
is
all
powerful
with
the
king
i
shall
be
happy
to
do
what
i
can
sir
said
i
but
i
do
not
suppose
her
grace
will
confide
in
me
i
know
that
he
said
but
you
may
pick
up
something
you
are
the
fourth
i
have
sent
on
that
errand
and
nothing
come
of
it
we
talked
a
while
longer
on
these
affairs
myself
more
and
more
astonished
at
the
confidence
given
me
but
i
think
now
that
it
was
because
the
duke
had
so
few
that
he
could
trust
and
when
i
took
my
leave
it
was
with
a
letter
written
and
signed
and
sealed
by
the
duke
which
i
was
to
present
at
her
grace
lodgings
immediately
the
duchess
at
this
time
was
i
think
the
most
powerful
figure
in
england
since
her
influence
over
the
king
was
unbounded
she
had
come
to
england
ten
years
ago
as
charles
mistress
a
good
and
simple
maid
in
the
beginning
as
i
believe
and
of
good
breton
parents
who
would
not
let
her
go
to
the
french
court
yet
were
persuaded
to
let
her
go
to
the
english
where
god
help
her
she
soon
ceased
to
be
either
good
or
simple
in
the
year
she
was
created
duchess
of
portsmouth
who
up
to
that
time
had
been
the
breton
woman
madame
kéroual
or
as
she
was
called
in
england
madam
carwell
three
years
later
her
son
had
been
made
duke
of
richmond
at
the
time
of
the
popish
plot
she
had
been
terrified
of
her
life
and
it
was
only
at
the
king
persuasion
that
she
remained
in
england
i
can
not
say
that
she
was
popular
with
the
people
for
her
coach
was
cried
after
pretty
often
unless
she
had
her
guards
with
her
and
this
always
threw
her
into
paroxysms
of
terror
yet
she
remained
in
england
and
was
treated
as
of
royal
blood
both
by
charles
who
loved
her
and
james
who
feared
her
a
couple
of
days
later
i
received
a
message
to
say
that
her
grace
would
receive
me
after
supper
on
that
same
evening
so
i
put
on
my
finest
suit
and
set
out
in
a
hired
coach
the
duchess
lived
at
this
time
in
lodgings
at
the
end
of
the
great
gallery
in
whitehall
and
i
think
that
of
all
the
apartments
i
had
ever
set
eyes
on
even
the
royal
lodgings
themselves
this
was
the
finest
and
no
wonder
for
they
had
been
pulled
down
two
or
three
times
before
she
was
satisfied
thus
fulfilling
the
old
proverb
of
setting
a
beggar
on
horseback
i
was
made
to
wait
awhile
in
an
outer
chamber
all
as
if
she
were
royal
and
i
examined
the
pieces
of
furniture
there
and
there
was
nothing
in
the
queen
own
lodging
to
approach
to
them
so
massy
was
the
plate
and
so
great
and
exquisitely
carved
the
tables
and
chairs
when
i
was
taken
through
at
last
by
a
fellow
dressed
in
a
livery
like
the
king
own
the
next
room
where
i
was
bidden
to
sit
down
was
full
as
fine
there
was
a
quantity
of
tapestry
upon
the
walls
of
new
french
fabric
so
resembling
paintings
that
i
had
to
touch
before
i
was
sure
of
them
of
versailles
and
germain
with
hunting
pieces
and
landscapes
and
exotic
fowls
there
were
japan
cabinets
screens
and
pendule
clocks
and
a
great
quantity
of
plate
all
of
silver
as
well
as
were
the
sconces
that
held
the
candles
and
the
ceilings
were
painted
all
over
as
were
his
majesty
own
i
suppose
by
verrio
as
i
sat
there
considering
what
i
should
say
to
her
i
heard
music
continually
through
one
of
the
doors
and
when
at
last
it
was
flung
open
and
my
lady
came
through
she
brought
as
it
were
a
gust
of
music
with
her
i
bowed
very
low
as
i
had
been
instructed
in
spite
of
the
character
of
the
woman
and
then
i
kneeled
to
kiss
her
hand
then
she
sat
down
and
left
me
standing
like
a
servant
she
appeared
at
that
time
to
be
about
thirty
years
old
though
i
think
she
was
far
beyond
this
but
she
had
a
wonderfully
childish
face
very
artfully
painted
and
darkened
by
the
eyes
i
can
not
deny
however
that
she
was
very
handsome
indeed
and
well
by
her
jewels
and
her
gown
cut
very
low
so
as
to
shew
her
dazzling
skin
her
fingers
too
when
i
kissed
them
were
but
one
mass
of
gems
her
first
simplicity
was
gone
indeed
i
loathed
this
work
that
i
was
sent
on
since
it
forced
me
to
be
civil
to
this
spoiled
creature
instead
of
as
i
should
have
wished
naming
her
for
what
she
was
to
her
face
however
that
had
been
done
pretty
often
by
the
mob
so
i
doubt
if
i
could
have
told
her
anything
she
did
not
know
already
her
voice
was
set
very
low
and
was
a
little
rough
yet
it
was
not
ugly
at
all
she
spoke
in
french
and
so
did
i
well
mallock
she
said
i
have
company
but
i
did
not
wish
to
refuse
another
of
his
royal
highness
ambassadors
what
is
the
matter
now
if
you
please
now
i
knew
that
this
kind
of
personage
loved
flattery
for
it
was
nothing
but
this
that
had
ruined
her
and
that
it
could
scarcely
be
too
thick
so
i
framed
my
first
sentences
in
that
key
for
after
all
my
first
business
was
to
please
her
his
royal
highness
is
desolated
madam
i
said
because
he
thinks
he
has
displeased
you
displeased
me
she
cried
why
what
talk
is
this
of
a
prince
to
a
poor
frenchwoman
she
smiled
very
unpleasantly
as
she
said
this
and
nearly
all
the
time
i
was
with
her
her
eyes
were
running
up
and
down
my
figure
i
was
wearing
a
good
ring
or
two
also
and
my
was
very
prettily
set
with
diamonds
and
she
always
had
an
eye
for
such
things
there
can
be
no
talk
of
prince
and
subject
madam
i
said
when
her
grace
of
portsmouth
is
in
question
she
smiled
once
more
and
i
saw
that
she
liked
this
kind
of
talk
so
i
gave
her
plenty
of
it
la
la
she
said
this
is
very
pretty
talk
what
is
your
business
sir
if
you
please
it
is
what
i
have
said
madam
and
nothing
else
upon
my
honour
his
royal
highness
is
seriously
discomposed
then
why
does
he
not
come
to
see
me
and
ask
me
himself
snapped
my
lady
he
hath
not
been
these
three
months
back
why
does
he
send
a
a
messenger
she
was
on
the
very
point
of
saying
and
it
pleased
me
that
she
had
not
done
so
i
noted
also
in
my
mind
that
wounded
vanity
was
one
of
the
reasons
for
her
behaviour
as
it
usually
is
with
a
woman
madam
i
said
his
royal
highness
does
not
come
i
am
sure
because
he
does
not
know
how
he
would
be
received
it
seems
that
your
favour
is
given
to
another
altogether
now
god
bless
us
said
the
duchess
why
not
say
monmouth
and
be
done
with
it
it
is
your
grace
who
has
named
him
i
said
but
the
duke
of
monmouth
is
the
very
man
she
gave
a
great
flirt
to
her
fan
and
i
saw
by
her
face
what
i
had
suspected
before
that
it
was
not
only
with
music
that
she
was
intoxicated
then
she
jerked
her
pretty
head
sit
down
sir
she
said
and
when
i
had
done
so
pleased
at
the
progress
i
was
making
she
told
me
everything
i
wanted
to
know
though
she
did
not
think
so
herself
see
here
mallock
you
appear
an
intelligent
kind
of
man
now
ask
yourself
a
question
or
two
and
you
will
know
all
that
i
know
myself
what
kind
of
a
chance
think
you
has
a
catholic
as
king
of
england
as
against
a
protestant
and
what
kind
of
a
chance
think
you
has
the
duke
of
york
beside
the
duke
of
monmouth
i
speak
freely
because
from
your
having
come
on
this
errand
i
suppose
you
are
a
man
that
can
be
trusted
i
wonder
you
have
not
seen
it
for
yourself
his
royal
highness
has
no
tact
no
he
sets
all
against
him
by
his
lordly
ways
he
could
not
make
a
friend
of
any
man
to
save
his
life
he
can
never
forget
his
royalty
he
sulks
there
in
his
lodgings
and
will
not
even
come
to
see
a
poor
frenchwoman
and
now
sir
you
know
all
that
i
know
myself
the
woman
came
out
very
plainly
when
she
spoke
and
i
remember
even
then
wondering
that
his
majesty
could
make
so
much
of
her
but
it
is
often
the
way
that
men
of
good
breeding
can
never
see
its
lack
in
others
especially
in
women
or
will
not
however
i
concealed
all
this
from
her
grace
and
let
go
more
of
my
courtesy
but
madam
i
said
with
all
the
goodwill
in
the
world
it
is
versailles
to
a
china
orange
that
his
royal
highness
will
succeed
in
the
event
i
do
not
say
that
he
will
make
as
good
a
king
as
the
duke
of
monmouth
nor
that
his
being
a
catholic
will
be
anything
but
a
disadvantage
to
him
but
disadvantages
or
no
if
he
is
king
it
is
surely
better
to
be
upon
his
side
and
help
not
hinder
him
i
would
not
have
dared
to
say
such
a
thing
to
a
respectable
woman
for
it
advised
her
almost
without
disguise
to
look
to
her
own
advantage
only
she
gave
me
a
sharp
look
that
is
where
we
are
not
agreed
said
she
i
made
a
little
despairing
gesture
with
my
hands
well
madam
if
you
do
not
accept
facts
why
do
you
think
the
duke
of
york
is
so
sure
to
succeed
she
asked
sharply
and
i
saw
that
i
had
touched
her
madam
i
said
we
english
are
a
very
curious
people
it
is
true
that
we
cut
off
his
late
majesty
head
but
it
is
also
true
that
we
welcomed
back
his
son
with
acclamation
we
are
not
quick
and
logical
as
is
your
own
glorious
nation
we
have
very
much
more
sentimentality
and
among
those
matters
that
we
are
sentimental
about
is
that
of
royalty
i
dare
wager
a
good
deal
that
if
government
by
monarchy
goes
in
either
of
our
countries
it
will
go
in
your
grace
fatherland
first
we
abuse
those
in
high
places
and
we
disobey
them
and
we
talk
against
them
yet
we
cling
to
them
and
there
is
a
second
reason
i
went
on
rapidly
for
she
was
at
the
point
of
speaking
we
are
a
highly
respectable
nation
with
all
the
prejudices
of
respectability
and
one
of
these
prejudices
concerns
his
grace
of
monmouth
parentage
i
saw
her
flare
scarlet
at
that
but
i
knew
what
i
was
doing
it
is
a
foolish
pharisaic
sort
of
prejudice
no
doubt
madam
but
it
is
there
and
i
do
not
believe
she
could
bear
no
more
for
her
own
son
had
precisely
that
bar
sinister
also
and
in
her
anger
she
said
what
i
wished
to
hear
this
is
intolerable
sir
she
flared
at
me
gripping
the
arms
of
her
chair
i
do
not
wish
to
hear
any
more
about
your
stupid
english
nation
it
is
because
they
are
stupid
that
i
do
what
i
do
they
can
be
led
by
the
nose
like
your
stupid
king
i
can
do
what
i
will
madam
i
entreated
and
truly
my
accents
were
piteous
i
beg
of
you
not
to
speak
like
that
i
am
a
servant
of
his
majesty
i
can
not
hear
such
talk
i
rose
from
my
chair
now
in
that
court
there
was
more
i
think
than
in
any
place
on
god
earth
and
she
knew
that
well
enough
and
understood
that
she
had
said
something
which
unless
she
prevented
it
would
go
straight
to
charles
ears
it
is
true
that
she
ruled
him
absolutely
but
he
kicked
under
her
yoke
a
little
now
and
then
and
if
there
were
one
thing
that
he
would
not
brook
it
was
to
be
called
stupid
she
let
go
of
the
arms
of
her
chair
and
went
a
little
white
i
think
she
had
no
idea
till
then
that
i
was
in
the
king
service
i
said
nothing
she
murmured
i
stood
regarding
her
and
i
think
my
manner
must
have
been
good
i
said
nothing
that
should
be
repeated
she
added
a
little
louder
i
still
kept
silence
you
will
not
repeat
it
mr
mallock
madam
i
said
i
have
only
one
desire
and
that
is
to
serve
his
majesty
and
his
majesty
lawful
heir
my
mouth
can
be
sealed
absolutely
if
that
end
is
served
i
said
that
very
slowly
and
deliberately
i
saw
her
breathe
a
little
more
freely
it
was
a
piteous
sight
to
see
a
woman
so
depending
upon
such
things
as
a
complexion
and
whiffs
of
scandal
and
servants
gossip
mallock
she
said
i
can
not
veer
round
all
in
a
moment
even
though
i
must
confess
that
what
you
have
said
to
me
has
touched
me
very
closely
she
looked
at
me
miserably
madam
i
said
for
i
dared
not
grasp
at
more
than
this
for
fear
of
losing
all
that
has
wiped
out
your
words
as
if
they
had
never
been
spoken
i
kissed
her
hand
and
went
out
i
did
not
go
to
the
duke
for
i
hold
that
when
a
man
has
to
sift
carefully
between
what
he
must
say
and
what
he
must
not
it
is
best
to
do
it
on
paper
but
i
went
back
to
my
lodgings
and
wrote
to
him
that
it
was
merely
for
her
own
advantage
that
the
duchess
had
behaved
so
and
because
she
thought
that
the
protestant
succession
was
certain
her
own
advantage
that
is
to
say
mingled
with
a
little
woman
vanity
i
begged
his
royal
highness
therefore
to
go
and
see
the
duchess
if
he
thought
well
and
if
possible
publicly
when
she
held
her
reception
before
he
went
to
scotland
for
i
was
diplomat
enough
to
know
that
the
assuming
he
would
go
to
scotland
would
be
the
best
persuasion
to
make
him
and
at
the
end
i
told
him
that
i
thought
my
arguments
had
prevailed
a
little
with
her
grace
and
that
though
she
could
not
at
once
turn
weathercock
he
might
take
my
word
for
it
that
she
would
not
be
so
forward
as
she
had
been
but
i
did
not
tell
him
what
argument
i
had
chiefly
used
for
i
hold
that
even
to
such
a
woman
as
that
a
man
should
keep
his
word
everything
i
told
the
duke
in
that
letter
fell
true
the
duchess
began
to
cool
very
much
in
the
protestant
cause
though
perhaps
that
was
helped
a
little
by
monmouth
having
fallen
under
the
displeasure
and
the
duke
of
york
went
two
or
three
times
to
the
duchess
receptions
and
to
scotland
on
the
day
before
parliament
met
chapter
vi
it
was
on
chiffinch
advice
that
i
remained
in
london
for
the
present
determining
however
to
spend
christmas
at
hare
street
and
indeed
i
had
plenty
to
do
in
making
my
reports
to
rome
on
the
situation
there
was
a
storm
brewing
from
all
over
the
country
came
in
to
the
king
as
they
were
called
praying
him
to
assemble
parliament
and
that
not
only
for
defence
against
popery
but
against
despotism
as
well
and
all
these
were
nourished
and
inspired
by
my
lord
shaftesbury
his
majesty
answered
this
by
proclaiming
through
the
magistrates
that
such
addresses
were
contrary
to
the
laws
that
left
such
things
at
the
king
discretion
and
the
against
the
presently
begun
to
send
addresses
beseeching
his
majesty
to
defend
that
prerogative
of
his
fearlessly
names
began
to
be
flung
about
the
called
the
other
the
party
of
because
of
their
whey
faces
that
would
turn
all
sour
and
the
nicknamed
the
others
which
was
the
name
of
the
banditti
in
the
wilder
parts
of
ireland
so
it
appeared
that
whenever
parliament
should
meet
there
would
be
as
the
saying
is
a
pretty
kettle
of
fish
to
fry
parliament
met
at
last
on
the
of
october
the
duke
of
york
having
set
out
to
scotland
with
a
fine
retinue
on
the
day
before
which
some
thought
too
pointed
and
the
king
himself
opened
it
with
all
my
love
for
his
majesty
i
am
forced
to
confess
that
he
presented
a
very
poor
spectacle
on
that
occasion
not
only
did
he
largely
yield
to
the
popular
clamour
and
profess
himself
willing
within
reason
to
befriend
any
measures
for
the
repression
of
popery
but
he
stood
at
the
fire
afterwards
in
the
house
of
lords
for
a
great
while
warming
his
back
and
laughing
with
his
friends
i
was
in
the
gallery
and
saw
it
myself
laughter
is
a
very
good
thing
but
a
seemly
gravity
is
no
less
good
as
might
be
expected
of
curs
they
barked
all
the
louder
when
there
was
no
one
to
stand
up
to
them
and
within
a
week
after
numerous
insulting
proposals
made
to
honour
that
horde
of
lying
informers
that
had
done
so
much
mischief
already
and
of
preferring
such
men
as
tonge
to
high
positions
in
the
church
once
more
that
exclusion
bill
of
theirs
came
forward
the
commons
passed
it
as
might
be
expected
since
my
lord
shaftesbury
had
packed
that
house
with
his
own
nominees
i
was
in
whitehall
on
the
night
that
it
was
debated
in
the
lords
four
days
later
and
up
to
ten
his
majesty
had
not
returned
from
the
house
for
he
was
present
at
that
debate
a
very
unusual
thing
with
him
i
went
up
and
down
for
a
little
while
outside
his
majesty
lodgings
and
about
ten
i
saw
chiffinch
coming
his
majesty
is
not
back
yet
he
said
and
presently
he
proposed
that
we
should
go
to
the
house
ourselves
from
the
little
gallery
whither
he
conducted
me
i
had
a
very
good
view
of
the
house
and
yet
more
of
one
of
the
strangest
sights
ever
seen
there
upon
the
carpet
that
was
laid
by
the
fire
for
it
was
a
cold
night
stood
his
majesty
himself
with
a
circle
of
friends
about
him
now
and
again
there
came
up
to
him
one
of
the
peers
for
whom
he
had
sent
he
talked
to
him
a
few
minutes
and
then
let
him
go
for
he
was
doing
nothing
else
than
solicit
each
of
them
for
his
vote
the
cry
was
raised
presently
to
clear
the
house
and
we
went
away
for
their
lordships
were
to
record
their
votes
and
we
had
not
stood
half
an
hour
in
the
court
outside
before
there
came
a
great
cheering
and
shouting
followed
hard
by
a
great
booing
from
the
crowds
that
stood
packed
outside
my
lords
had
thrown
out
the
exclusion
bill
by
above
of
their
number
which
was
presently
his
majesty
came
out
by
his
private
way
laughing
and
jesting
aloud
with
two
or
three
others
it
was
to
be
expected
that
the
would
make
some
retort
to
this
and
what
that
retort
was
i
heard
a
few
days
later
from
a
couple
of
gentlemen
who
came
into
the
parlour
at
the
covent
garden
tavern
where
i
was
taking
my
supper
they
came
in
very
eagerly
talking
together
and
when
they
had
sat
down
one
of
them
turned
to
me
you
have
heard
the
news
sir
no
sir
what
news
my
lord
stafford
is
to
be
tried
for
his
life
i
did
not
know
what
political
complexion
these
two
were
of
so
i
looked
wise
and
inquired
how
that
was
known
a
clerk
that
is
in
the
house
of
lords
told
me
sir
i
have
always
found
his
information
to
be
correct
this
was
all
very
well
for
the
clerk
friend
thought
i
but
not
enough
for
me
and
so
soon
as
i
had
finished
my
supper
and
bidden
them
i
was
off
to
chiffinch
why
yes
he
said
it
is
like
to
be
true
enough
i
had
heard
talk
of
it
but
no
more
it
is
he
whom
they
have
chosen
as
the
weakest
of
the
five
in
the
tower
and
if
they
can
prevail
against
him
they
will
proceed
against
the
rest
i
suppose
i
wonder
who
the
informers
will
be
i
inquired
how
it
was
that
the
peers
did
not
resist
they
fear
for
themselves
and
their
places
said
chiffinch
they
will
yield
up
anything
but
that
if
a
man
or
two
will
but
push
them
hard
enough
and
if
they
try
my
lord
they
will
certainly
condemn
him
there
is
no
question
of
that
to
acquit
him
would
cause
a
yet
greater
uproar
than
to
refuse
to
hear
the
case
at
all
and
his
majesty
chiffinch
eyed
me
gravely
his
majesty
will
never
prefer
his
private
feelings
before
the
public
utility
and
this
is
to
the
public
utility
why
yes
or
the
thinks
it
is
it
is
the
best
answer
they
can
make
to
their
rebuff
on
the
matter
of
the
exclusion
bill
the
rumour
proved
to
be
perfectly
true
the
five
lords
who
were
still
in
the
tower
had
been
sent
there
it
may
be
remembered
above
two
years
ago
on
account
of
their
religion
although
the
pretended
plot
professed
by
oates
was
of
course
alleged
against
them
since
that
time
parliament
had
been
busy
with
other
matters
but
such
an
opportunity
was
now
too
good
to
be
lost
of
striking
against
the
and
at
the
same
time
of
feeding
the
excitement
and
fanaticism
of
their
own
the
trial
came
on
pretty
quickly
beginning
on
the
last
day
of
november
and
as
i
had
never
seen
a
peer
tried
by
his
fellows
i
determined
to
be
present
and
obtained
an
order
to
admit
me
every
day
and
the
first
day
strangely
enough
was
the
birthday
of
my
lord
stafford
himself
westminster
hall
in
which
the
trial
was
held
was
a
very
noble
sight
when
all
the
folks
were
in
their
places
i
sat
myself
in
a
high
gallery
in
which
sat
too
ambassadors
and
public
ministers
at
the
upper
end
above
the
king
state
i
could
not
see
that
which
was
immediately
beneath
me
neither
of
the
box
in
which
sat
his
majesty
during
a
good
deal
of
the
trial
nor
upon
the
left
side
where
the
great
ladies
sat
but
i
had
a
very
good
view
of
the
long
forms
on
which
the
peers
sat
before
the
state
under
which
was
the
throne
the
for
the
judges
and
the
chair
of
the
lord
steward
all
which
was
ranged
exactly
as
in
the
house
of
lords
itself
behind
the
peers
forms
rose
the
stands
scaffolded
up
to
the
roof
for
the
house
of
commons
to
sit
in
so
that
the
hall
resembled
the
shape
of
a
v
in
its
section
with
a
long
arena
in
the
midst
the
lower
end
held
in
the
middle
the
bar
for
the
prisoner
to
stand
at
and
a
place
for
him
to
retire
into
a
box
for
his
two
daughters
of
whom
one
was
the
marchioness
of
winchester
and
the
proper
places
for
the
lieutenant
of
the
tower
whence
my
lord
was
brought
by
water
the
who
had
the
edge
of
his
axe
turned
away
from
the
prisoner
and
the
guards
that
kept
him
upon
either
hand
of
the
entrance
nearer
to
the
throne
stood
upon
one
side
a
box
for
the
witnesses
and
upon
the
other
those
that
were
called
the
managers
being
lawyers
and
attorneys
and
the
like
but
these
were
in
their
cloaks
and
swords
as
were
others
who
were
with
them
of
the
parliamentary
party
since
they
were
here
as
representing
the
commons
and
not
as
lawyers
first
of
all
the
two
first
days
were
tedious
enough
and
i
did
not
stay
a
great
while
for
the
articles
of
impeachment
were
read
and
formalities
discharged
one
matter
of
interest
only
appeared
and
that
was
the
names
of
the
witnesses
when
i
learned
for
the
first
time
that
oates
and
dugdale
and
turberville
were
to
be
the
principal
i
think
more
than
i
were
astonished
to
hear
that
oates
was
in
this
conspiracy
too
as
in
so
many
others
and
that
he
would
swear
when
the
time
came
that
he
had
delivered
to
my
lord
a
commission
from
the
holy
father
to
be
paymaster
in
the
famous
catholic
army
of
which
we
had
heard
so
much
i
was
much
occupied
too
on
these
days
in
observing
the
appearance
and
demeanour
of
the
prisoner
whom
i
could
see
very
well
he
was
now
in
his
seventieth
year
and
looked
full
his
age
but
he
bore
himself
with
great
dignity
and
restraint
he
had
somewhat
of
a
cold
look
in
his
face
and
indeed
it
was
true
that
he
was
not
greatly
beloved
by
anybody
though
respected
by
all
the
principal
witnesses
even
before
oates
were
dugdale
and
turberville
first
these
gave
their
general
testimony
and
afterwards
their
particular
dugdale
related
how
that
the
plot
in
general
had
been
on
hand
for
above
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
and
he
repeated
all
the
stuff
that
had
so
stirred
up
the
people
before
as
to
indulgences
and
pardons
promised
by
the
pope
to
those
who
would
kill
the
king
i
must
confess
that
i
fell
asleep
once
or
twice
during
this
testifying
for
i
knew
it
all
by
heart
already
and
in
particular
he
said
that
my
lord
had
debated
with
others
at
my
lord
aston
how
to
kill
the
king
and
that
himself
was
present
at
such
debates
a
great
hum
broke
out
in
the
hall
when
dugdale
swore
that
he
had
heard
with
his
own
ears
my
lord
stafford
and
others
who
had
been
present
give
their
assent
one
by
one
to
the
king
murder
his
majesty
himself
i
was
told
later
by
chiffinch
retired
to
the
back
of
his
box
to
laugh
when
he
heard
that
said
for
neither
then
nor
ever
did
he
believe
a
word
of
it
next
came
oates
and
he
too
reaffirmed
what
he
had
said
before
with
an
hundred
ingenious
additions
and
particularities
as
to
times
and
places
and
this
i
think
as
much
as
anything
was
the
reason
why
so
many
simple
folk
had
believed
him
in
the
first
event
then
turberville
who
said
falsely
that
he
had
once
been
a
friar
and
at
douay
related
how
my
lord
as
he
had
said
had
attempted
to
bribe
him
to
kill
the
king
and
suchlike
nonsense
this
he
said
had
happened
in
france
my
lord
stafford
questioned
the
prisoners
a
little
and
shewed
up
many
holes
in
their
story
for
instance
he
asked
turberville
whether
he
had
ever
been
in
his
chamber
in
paris
and
put
this
question
through
the
high
steward
yes
my
lord
i
have
said
turberville
what
kind
of
a
room
is
it
asked
my
lord
i
ca
remember
that
said
turberville
who
before
had
sworn
he
had
been
in
it
many
times
no
said
my
lord
i
dare
swear
you
ca
i
can
not
tell
the
particulars
what
stools
and
chairs
were
in
the
room
on
the
third
day
which
was
thursday
my
lord
was
bidden
to
call
his
witnesses
and
make
his
defence
and
i
must
confess
that
he
did
not
do
this
very
well
for
first
he
made
a
great
pother
about
this
and
that
statute
of
the
charles
ii
and
edward
nothing
of
which
served
him
at
all
and
next
his
witnesses
did
him
harm
rather
than
good
and
dugdale
whom
he
examined
was
so
clever
and
quiet
and
positive
in
his
statements
that
it
was
mere
oath
against
oath
third
my
lord
stafford
himself
did
appear
a
little
confused
as
to
whether
he
had
known
dugdale
or
not
not
being
sure
of
him
as
he
said
in
his
periwig
for
when
dugdale
was
bailiff
to
my
lord
aston
at
tixall
he
wore
no
such
thing
all
that
he
did
in
regard
to
dugdale
was
to
shew
by
one
of
his
witnesses
that
dugdale
when
bailiff
at
tixall
had
been
a
mean
dishonest
fellow
but
then
as
the
lord
high
sheriff
observed
it
would
scarcely
be
an
honest
man
whom
one
would
bribe
to
kill
the
king
when
he
dealt
with
turberville
too
he
did
not
do
much
better
for
he
stood
continually
upon
little
points
of
no
importance
such
points
as
a
witness
may
very
well
mistake
as
to
where
the
windows
of
his
house
in
paris
looked
out
and
whether
the
prince
of
conde
lodged
to
right
or
left
such
little
points
as
a
lawyer
would
leave
alone
if
he
could
not
prove
them
positively
on
the
fourth
and
fifth
day
i
was
not
present
for
i
had
a
great
deal
to
do
in
writing
my
reports
for
rome
and
on
the
sixth
day
which
was
monday
i
was
not
there
above
an
hour
for
i
saw
that
the
trial
would
not
end
that
day
but
on
the
tuesday
i
was
there
before
ten
and
at
eleven
my
lords
came
back
to
give
judgment
it
was
a
dark
morning
as
it
had
been
at
the
trial
of
the
jesuits
and
the
candles
were
lighted
as
soon
as
all
were
seated
my
lord
stafford
was
brought
in
and
i
observed
him
during
all
that
followed
he
stood
very
quiet
at
the
bar
with
his
hands
folded
and
although
before
the
voting
was
over
he
must
have
known
which
way
it
was
gone
he
flinched
never
a
hair
nor
went
white
at
all
his
bringing
in
while
the
voting
was
done
was
contrary
to
the
law
but
no
one
observed
it
and
i
knew
nothing
of
it
till
afterwards
the
lord
high
steward
first
asked
humble
leave
from
my
lords
to
sit
down
as
he
spoke
as
he
was
ailing
a
little
and
then
put
the
question
to
each
lord
beginning
with
my
lord
butler
of
weston
my
lord
butler
of
weston
said
he
is
william
lord
viscount
stafford
guilty
of
the
treason
whereof
he
stands
impeached
or
not
guilty
and
my
lord
answered
in
a
loud
voice
laying
his
hand
upon
his
breast
not
guilty
upon
my
honour
there
were
in
all
lords
who
voted
and
each
answered
guilty
or
not
guilty
upon
his
honour
as
had
done
the
first
each
standing
up
in
his
place
at
the
first
i
could
not
tell
on
which
side
lay
the
most
but
as
they
went
on
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
he
was
condemned
prince
rupert
duke
of
cumberland
voted
last
as
he
was
of
royal
blood
and
gave
it
against
him
the
lord
high
sheriff
who
had
marked
down
each
vote
upon
a
paper
on
his
desk
now
added
them
all
up
and
there
was
a
great
silence
while
he
did
this
i
could
see
him
doing
it
from
where
i
sat
then
he
spoke
in
a
loud
voice
raising
his
head
my
lords
said
he
upon
telling
your
votes
i
find
that
there
are
of
my
lords
that
think
the
prisoner
not
guilty
and
that
have
found
him
guilty
serjeant
said
he
and
then
i
think
that
he
was
about
to
call
for
the
prisoner
when
he
saw
him
already
there
then
before
he
spoke
again
i
saw
the
headsman
turn
the
edge
of
the
axe
towards
my
lord
stafford
and
a
rustle
of
whispering
ran
through
the
hall
my
lord
stafford
said
the
high
steward
i
have
but
heavy
tidings
for
you
your
lordship
hath
been
impeached
for
high
treason
you
have
pleaded
not
guilty
my
lords
have
heard
your
defence
and
have
considered
of
the
evidence
and
their
lordships
do
find
you
guilty
of
the
treason
whereof
you
are
impeached
then
my
lord
stafford
raising
his
head
yet
higher
and
flinching
not
at
all
cried
out
god
holy
name
be
praised
my
lords
for
it
then
the
lord
high
steward
asked
him
why
judgment
of
death
should
not
be
given
on
him
and
after
saying
that
he
had
not
expected
it
and
that
he
prayed
god
to
forgive
those
that
had
sworn
falsely
against
him
he
went
on
as
before
upon
a
legal
point
that
was
wholly
without
relevance
that
he
had
not
been
forced
to
hold
up
his
hand
at
the
beginning
as
he
thought
to
be
a
legal
form
in
all
trials
and
when
he
had
said
that
my
lords
went
out
to
consider
their
judgment
it
was
above
an
hour
before
they
came
back
during
that
hour
my
lord
stafford
was
permitted
to
sit
down
in
the
box
provided
for
him
but
no
one
was
admitted
to
speak
with
him
he
sat
very
still
leaning
his
head
upon
his
hand
when
all
were
come
back
again
he
was
made
to
stand
up
at
the
bar
once
more
and
his
face
was
as
resolute
and
quiet
as
ever
then
when
the
lord
high
steward
had
answered
his
point
saying
that
in
no
way
did
the
holding
up
of
the
hand
affect
the
legality
of
the
trial
he
began
to
give
sentence
my
part
therefore
which
remains
said
he
is
a
very
sad
one
for
i
never
yet
gave
sentence
of
death
upon
any
man
and
am
extremely
sorry
that
i
must
begin
with
your
lordship
my
lord
nottingham
was
silent
for
an
instant
when
he
had
said
that
seeking
i
think
to
command
his
voice
and
then
he
began
his
speech
which
i
think
he
had
learned
by
heart
and
it
was
one
of
the
most
moving
discourses
that
i
have
ever
heard
though
he
committed
a
great
indecency
in
it
when
he
said
that
henceforth
no
man
could
ever
doubt
again
that
it
was
the
papists
who
had
burned
london
and
professed
himself
though
this
i
suppose
he
was
bound
to
do
satisfied
with
the
evidence
when
he
came
to
give
sentence
i
watched
my
lord
stafford
face
again
very
hard
and
he
flinched
never
a
hair
it
was
the
same
sentence
as
that
to
which
the
jesuits
too
had
listened
and
many
other
catholics
you
go
to
the
place
said
my
lord
nottingham
from
whence
you
came
from
thence
you
must
be
drawn
upon
a
hurdle
to
the
place
of
execution
when
you
come
there
you
must
be
hanged
up
by
the
neck
there
but
not
till
you
are
dead
for
you
must
be
cut
down
alive
your
bowels
ripped
up
before
your
face
and
thrown
into
the
fire
then
your
head
must
be
severed
from
your
body
and
your
body
divided
into
four
quarters
and
these
must
be
at
the
disposal
of
the
king
and
god
almighty
be
merciful
to
your
soul
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
and
then
my
lord
stafford
answered
my
lords
he
said
quietly
yet
so
that
every
word
was
heard
i
humbly
beseech
you
give
me
leave
to
speak
a
few
words
i
do
give
your
lordships
hearty
thanks
for
all
your
favours
to
me
i
do
here
in
the
presence
of
god
almighty
declare
i
have
no
malice
in
my
heart
to
them
that
have
condemned
me
i
know
not
who
they
are
nor
desire
to
know
i
forgive
them
all
and
beseech
your
lordships
all
to
pray
for
me
his
voice
shook
a
little
and
he
was
silent
then
he
went
on
again
all
else
were
as
still
as
death
my
lords
i
have
one
humble
request
to
make
to
your
lordships
and
that
is
my
lords
that
the
little
short
time
i
have
to
live
a
prisoner
i
may
not
be
a
close
prisoner
as
i
have
been
of
late
but
that
mr
lieutenant
may
have
an
order
that
my
wife
and
children
and
friends
may
come
at
me
i
do
humbly
beg
this
favour
of
your
lordships
which
i
hope
you
will
be
pleased
to
give
me
his
voice
grew
very
low
as
he
ended
and
i
saw
his
lips
shake
a
little
the
lord
high
steward
answered
him
with
great
feeling
my
lord
stafford
he
said
and
that
was
an
unusual
thing
to
say
for
he
had
said
before
that
since
he
was
to
be
attainted
he
could
not
be
called
my
lord
again
i
believe
i
may
with
my
lords
leave
tell
you
one
thing
further
that
my
lords
as
they
proceed
with
rigour
of
justice
so
they
proceed
with
all
the
mercy
and
compassion
that
may
be
and
therefore
my
lords
will
be
humble
suitors
to
the
king
that
he
will
remit
all
the
punishment
but
the
taking
off
of
your
head
and
at
that
my
lord
stafford
broke
down
altogether
and
sobbed
upon
the
rail
and
it
is
a
terrible
thing
to
see
an
old
man
weep
like
that
when
he
could
command
his
voice
he
said
my
lords
your
justice
does
not
make
me
cry
but
your
goodness
then
my
lord
nottingham
stood
up
and
taking
the
staff
of
office
that
lay
across
his
desk
he
broke
it
in
two
halves
when
i
looked
again
the
prisoner
was
going
out
between
his
guards
and
the
axe
before
with
its
edge
turned
towards
him
in
token
of
death
i
was
at
chiffinch
again
that
night
to
hear
the
news
but
he
was
not
there
when
he
came
in
at
last
he
appeared
very
excited
then
he
told
me
the
news
they
are
at
his
majesty
already
he
said
that
he
can
not
remit
the
penalty
of
high
treason
but
the
king
swears
that
he
will
law
or
no
law
judges
or
no
judges
i
have
never
seen
him
so
determined
he
does
not
believe
one
word
of
the
evidence
yet
he
will
sign
the
warrant
for
the
beheading
i
asked
why
said
chiffinch
his
majesty
does
not
wish
to
go
upon
his
travels
again
chapter
vii
the
night
before
i
went
down
to
hare
street
for
i
went
on
christmas
eve
i
was
present
for
the
first
time
at
the
high
supper
in
whitehall
which
his
majesty
gave
to
the
spanish
ambassador
i
had
never
been
at
such
a
ceremony
before
and
went
out
of
curiosity
only
being
given
admission
to
one
of
the
stands
by
the
door
whence
i
might
see
it
all
it
would
have
appeared
very
strange
to
me
that
the
king
could
be
so
merry
as
he
was
that
night
when
so
much
innocent
blood
had
been
shed
upon
his
own
warrant
and
when
such
a
man
as
my
lord
stafford
was
lay
in
the
tower
expecting
his
death
six
days
later
had
i
not
known
the
nature
of
his
majesty
pretty
well
by
now
for
beneath
all
the
merriment
i
think
he
was
not
very
happy
though
he
never
shewed
a
sign
of
it
i
stood
as
i
said
upon
a
little
scaffold
to
the
right
of
the
entrance
and
i
was
glad
of
it
for
there
was
a
great
pack
of
people
crowded
in
as
the
custom
was
also
to
see
the
spectacle
and
they
were
all
about
me
and
in
front
as
well
as
in
the
gallery
where
the
music
was
the
banqueting
hall
had
its
walls
all
hung
over
with
very
rich
tapestry
representing
all
kinds
of
merry
scenes
of
hunting
and
fighting
and
the
like
and
there
were
great
presses
along
the
walls
piled
with
plate
of
gold
and
silver
the
music
was
all
on
the
balusters
above
trumpets
and
kettledrums
that
played
as
their
majesties
came
in
after
the
heralds
and
black
rod
i
had
not
had
before
an
opportunity
of
seeing
the
queen
so
well
as
i
saw
her
now
and
i
watched
her
closely
for
i
was
sorry
for
the
poor
woman
she
was
very
gloriously
dressed
in
a
pale
brocade
with
quantities
of
flanders
lace
upon
her
shoulders
and
at
her
elbows
that
set
off
her
little
figure
very
well
she
was
very
handsome
i
thought
though
so
little
and
her
complexion
and
her
face
were
both
very
good
except
that
her
teeth
shewed
too
much
as
she
smiled
she
had
however
nothing
of
that
witty
or
brilliant
air
about
her
that
pleased
the
king
so
much
in
women
and
she
sat
very
quietly
throughout
supper
beside
the
king
not
speaking
a
great
deal
but
i
thought
i
saw
in
her
at
first
a
very
piteous
desire
to
please
him
and
he
listened
smiling
as
a
man
might
listen
to
a
dull
child
and
indeed
i
think
that
that
was
all
that
he
thought
of
her
his
majesty
himself
appeared
very
noble
and
gallant
in
his
order
of
the
garter
and
with
the
golden
fleece
too
over
his
rich
suit
both
their
majesties
wore
a
good
number
of
jewels
their
majesties
sat
at
a
little
high
table
under
a
state
with
their
gentlemen
and
ladies
standing
behind
them
and
the
spaniards
with
the
king
other
guests
at
a
table
that
ran
down
the
middle
of
the
hall
yet
close
enough
at
the
upper
end
for
the
ambassador
and
the
king
to
speak
together
my
lord
shaftesbury
was
there
and
it
was
strange
to
see
him
i
knowing
how
much
he
was
privately
under
his
majesty
displeasure
and
prince
rupert
very
fat
and
pale
and
stupid
and
sir
thomas
killigrew
and
a
score
of
others
his
majesty
was
served
by
the
lords
and
pensioners
and
the
rest
by
pages
and
the
like
and
gentlemen
about
the
middle
of
the
dinner
toasts
were
drunk
and
first
of
all
his
majesty
and
the
trumpets
sounded
and
the
music
played
all
standing
and
when
they
were
sat
down
again
i
heard
the
guns
shot
off
at
the
tower
and
i
thought
of
him
who
lay
there
and
how
he
heard
them
near
at
hand
and
how
he
might
have
been
here
supping
with
the
spaniards
had
he
not
fallen
under
the
popular
displeasure
on
account
of
his
religion
it
was
a
wonderful
thing
to
see
the
toast
drunk
all
that
company
standing
upon
its
feet
and
shouting
when
the
banquet
came
in
and
the
french
wines
a
very
curious
scene
of
disorder
presently
began
these
gentlemen
flinging
the
dessert
about
and
at
one
another
for
they
were
beginning
to
be
a
little
drunk
and
i
saw
killigrew
fling
a
bunch
of
raisins
at
one
of
the
spaniards
in
sport
his
majesty
sat
smiling
throughout
not
at
all
displeased
but
not
drunk
at
all
himself
and
indeed
he
seldom
or
never
drank
to
excess
nor
gamed
to
excess
though
he
loved
to
see
others
do
so
at
the
end
when
all
was
finished
a
choir
under
the
direction
of
the
king
master
of
music
sang
a
piece
very
sweetly
from
the
gallery
with
the
wind
music
sounding
softly
but
no
one
paid
the
least
attention
and
then
we
all
stood
up
again
such
as
had
seats
on
the
scaffolds
to
see
their
majesties
go
out
but
such
a
scene
as
it
all
was
when
the
fruit
and
sweetmeats
were
flung
about
would
not
have
been
tolerated
in
rome
nor
i
think
in
any
court
in
europe
the
next
morning
very
early
james
and
i
set
out
for
hare
street
now
the
determination
had
been
forming
in
my
mind
for
some
weeks
past
that
i
would
delay
no
longer
in
that
which
lay
nearer
to
my
heart
by
now
i
think
than
all
politics
or
missions
or
anything
else
and
that
was
to
ask
my
cousin
dolly
if
she
would
have
me
or
no
and
all
the
way
down
to
hare
street
i
was
considering
this
and
rehearsing
what
i
should
say
i
still
had
some
hesitation
upon
the
point
for
i
remembered
how
strange
and
shy
she
had
been
when
i
had
last
been
there
and
had
thought
it
to
be
because
perhaps
she
believed
that
she
was
being
flung
at
me
by
her
father
but
the
memory
of
my
jealousy
had
worked
upon
me
very
much
that
jealousy
i
mean
that
i
had
had
when
his
grace
of
monmouth
had
come
and
made
his
pretty
speeches
and
i
was
all
but
resolved
to
put
all
to
the
test
one
way
or
the
other
i
had
thought
of
her
continually
in
all
that
i
had
seen
in
even
the
sorrowful
affair
in
westminster
hall
and
the
merry
business
a
fortnight
after
at
the
supper
i
had
seen
it
so
to
say
all
through
her
eyes
and
wondered
how
she
would
judge
of
it
all
and
wished
her
there
the
sting
of
my
jealousy
indeed
was
gone
i
reproached
myself
for
having
thought
ill
of
her
even
for
a
moment
yet
the
warmth
was
still
there
and
so
it
was
in
this
mood
that
i
came
at
last
to
the
house
at
it
was
extraordinary
merry
and
pretty
within
neither
was
below
stairs
when
i
came
for
my
cousin
tom
was
in
the
cellar
and
my
cousin
dolly
in
the
kitchen
and
when
i
went
into
the
great
chamber
it
was
all
untenanted
but
the
walls
were
hung
all
over
with
wreaths
and
holly
and
there
were
wax
candles
in
the
sconces
all
ready
for
lighting
the
next
day
but
the
parlour
where
were
the
hangings
of
the
knights
of
the
grail
was
even
more
pretty
for
there
were
hung
streamers
across
the
ceiling
from
corner
to
corner
and
a
great
bunch
of
mistletoe
united
them
at
the
centre
as
i
was
looking
at
this
my
cousin
dolly
ran
in
her
hands
all
over
flour
and
as
i
saw
her
here
i
said
to
myself
is
the
place
where
it
shall
be
done
she
could
not
touch
me
or
kiss
me
because
of
the
flour
but
she
permitted
me
to
kiss
her
my
cold
lips
against
her
warm
cheek
and
her
eyes
were
as
stars
for
merriment
there
is
something
very
strange
and
mystical
about
christmas
to
me
which
i
think
is
why
the
puritans
were
so
savage
against
it
for
i
suppose
that
the
time
in
which
our
lord
was
born
as
a
little
child
makes
children
of
us
all
that
we
may
understand
him
better
well
you
are
come
then
said
dolly
to
me
and
we
not
ready
for
you
i
am
ready
enough
for
home
said
i
and
she
smiled
very
friendly
at
me
for
that
word
i
am
glad
you
call
it
that
said
she
there
was
but
a
little
dried
fish
and
rice
for
supper
that
night
as
it
was
a
fast
day
but
the
supper
of
christmas
eve
is
always
a
kind
of
sacramental
for
me
when
midnight
mass
is
to
follow
there
was
no
midnight
mass
for
us
that
christmas
nor
any
mass
at
all
though
i
suppose
it
was
celebrated
as
usual
in
the
ambassadors
chapels
and
the
queen
yet
the
supper
had
yet
that
air
of
mystery
and
expectancy
about
it
we
are
all
to
dance
night
said
dolly
so
that
is
why
the
floor
is
cleared
in
the
great
chamber
i
said
she
nodded
at
me
she
looked
more
of
a
child
than
i
had
ever
seen
her
will
you
dance
with
me
dolly
i
asked
yes
she
said
but
my
first
is
with
my
father
i
told
them
presently
though
it
was
but
a
melancholy
tale
for
christmas
eve
of
my
lord
stafford
trial
and
all
that
i
had
seen
there
and
of
the
supper
last
night
in
whitehall
my
lord
is
to
be
beheaded
in
five
days
i
said
we
must
pray
for
his
soul
he
will
die
as
bravely
as
he
has
lived
i
make
no
doubt
and
you
have
no
doubt
of
his
innocence
asked
cousin
tom
i
stared
on
him
why
no
i
said
nor
any
man
except
those
paid
to
believe
his
guilt
he
pressed
me
to
tell
him
more
of
what
i
had
seen
in
london
and
whether
i
had
seen
the
duke
of
monmouth
again
he
is
in
holland
i
said
under
his
majesty
displeasure
but
i
saw
her
grace
of
portsmouth
why
that
is
his
friend
is
it
not
asked
tom
yes
i
said
and
a
poor
friend
to
his
father
and
the
duke
of
york
the
next
night
was
a
very
merry
one
we
had
dined
at
noon
as
usual
and
that
was
pretty
merry
too
for
all
the
servants
dined
with
us
and
the
men
from
the
farm
and
their
wives
it
was
sad
to
have
had
no
mass
at
all
and
all
that
we
had
instead
of
it
was
the
sound
of
the
bells
from
hormead
from
the
church
that
had
been
our
own
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
which
was
worse
than
nothing
at
dinner
we
observed
the
usual
ceremonial
with
the
drinking
of
healths
and
the
burning
of
candles
and
dolly
and
her
father
and
her
maid
sang
a
grace
at
the
beginning
and
end
with
a
carol
or
two
afterwards
that
was
a
surprise
to
me
it
was
very
homely
and
friendly
and
christian
and
i
saw
my
man
james
with
his
arm
around
one
of
the
dairymaids
which
is
pretty
christian
too
i
think
we
kept
it
up
till
it
was
near
time
to
get
supper
ready
telling
of
stories
all
the
while
about
the
fire
in
the
old
way
some
of
them
were
poor
enough
but
some
were
good
dick
the
whom
we
had
long
suspected
of
poaching
exposed
himself
very
sadly
when
the
ale
was
in
him
by
relating
a
number
of
poaching
tricks
i
had
never
heard
before
one
was
of
how
to
catch
stares
or
shepsters
when
they
fly
up
and
down
as
they
do
before
lodging
in
a
thicket
then
you
must
turn
out
said
dick
a
quick
stare
with
a
limed
thread
of
three
yards
long
when
she
will
fly
straight
to
the
rest
and
flocking
among
them
will
infallibly
bring
down
at
least
one
or
two
and
perhaps
five
or
six
all
entangled
in
her
thread
and
another
was
how
to
take
wild
ducks
go
into
the
water
said
he
up
to
the
neck
with
a
pumpkin
put
over
your
head
and
whilst
the
ducks
come
up
to
eat
the
seeds
you
may
take
them
by
the
legs
and
pull
them
under
quietly
one
by
one
till
they
be
drowned
but
i
would
not
like
to
do
that
in
cold
weather
and
indeed
it
seems
to
me
altogether
like
that
other
method
by
which
you
take
larks
by
of
salt
upon
their
tails
i
asked
dick
very
serious
whether
he
had
tried
that
plan
and
he
said
he
had
not
but
that
a
friend
had
told
him
of
it
and
the
company
became
very
merry
there
were
other
tales
too
more
grave
than
these
of
sacrilege
and
suchlike
one
which
my
man
james
told
was
of
a
man
who
took
an
altar
stone
from
an
old
church
to
press
cheeses
with
but
the
cheeses
ran
blood
so
they
took
it
from
that
and
put
it
in
the
laundry
to
bat
the
linen
on
but
at
night
such
a
sound
of
batting
was
heard
continually
from
the
laundry
and
no
one
there
that
the
man
took
it
back
again
to
the
church
and
buried
it
in
the
churchyard
and
another
was
of
two
men
who
had
thrown
down
a
upon
a
and
when
one
of
them
next
day
tried
to
move
it
from
there
for
the
playing
he
being
a
very
strong
man
and
lifting
it
on
end
it
fell
upon
him
backwards
and
crushed
his
breast
so
that
he
never
spoke
again
and
there
were
many
tales
told
of
and
how
my
lord
strafford
that
was
beheaded
before
his
death
told
his
son
to
get
rid
of
them
all
for
that
they
brought
a
curse
always
upon
them
that
held
them
and
there
was
another
story
told
at
the
end
by
a
man
from
the
farm
who
had
been
in
london
at
the
time
and
had
seen
it
for
himself
how
my
lords
castlehaven
and
arran
in
james
park
did
for
a
wager
kill
a
strong
buck
in
his
majesty
presence
by
running
on
foot
and
each
with
a
knife
only
they
took
nearly
three
hours
to
do
it
in
but
the
wager
was
for
six
so
they
won
that
they
killed
him
at
last
in
pond
having
driven
him
in
there
with
stones
i
could
well
believe
this
latter
tale
and
that
the
thing
had
been
done
in
the
king
presence
having
seen
what
i
had
at
supper
two
nights
before
when
we
came
into
the
great
chamber
after
supper
all
was
ready
for
the
dancing
and
thompson
who
was
the
hormead
schoolmaster
and
a
concealed
catholic
though
he
went
to
the
church
with
the
children
and
did
teach
them
their
religion
for
his
living
was
at
the
spinet
to
which
we
were
to
dance
there
was
a
fellow
also
to
play
the
fiddle
and
another
for
a
horn
the
dancing
was
very
pretty
to
see
and
we
did
a
great
number
beginning
as
the
custom
is
with
country
dances
and
it
was
in
the
first
of
these
that
my
cousin
dolly
did
dance
with
her
father
and
i
with
dolly
maid
we
were
all
dressed
too
not
indeed
in
our
best
but
in
our
second
best
with
silk
stockings
and
the
farm
men
and
the
maids
were
in
their
sunday
clothes
but
each
one
had
put
on
something
for
the
occasion
one
had
a
pair
of
buckled
shoes
of
a
hundred
years
old
and
another
an
old
ring
my
cousin
tom
and
i
wore
our
own
hair
and
no
periwigs
my
cousin
dolly
was
very
pretty
in
her
grey
sarcenet
with
her
little
pearls
and
her
hair
dressed
in
a
new
fashion
it
was
all
very
sweet
to
me
for
it
was
so
natural
and
without
affectation
and
it
all
might
have
been
a
hundred
years
ago
before
the
old
customs
went
out
and
the
new
came
in
from
france
in
which
men
pay
dancers
to
dance
instead
of
doing
it
for
themselves
the
room
was
very
well
decked
and
the
candles
lighted
all
round
the
walls
and
when
some
of
the
greenery
fell
down
and
was
trodden
underfoot
the
smell
of
it
was
very
pleasant
a
little
fire
was
on
the
hearth
not
great
lest
we
should
be
too
hot
we
danced
country
dances
first
as
i
have
said
and
then
my
cousin
dolly
shewed
us
one
or
two
town
dances
and
i
danced
a
sarabande
in
her
company
but
then
as
the
rest
of
the
folk
liked
the
country
dances
the
best
we
went
back
to
these
presently
i
saw
my
cousin
dolly
go
out
and
went
after
her
to
ask
if
she
needed
anything
no
said
she
only
to
get
cool
again
come
into
the
parlour
said
i
and
made
her
come
with
me
this
too
had
a
couple
of
candles
burning
over
the
hearth
and
a
little
fire
for
any
who
wished
to
come
in
but
it
was
empty
for
even
my
cousin
tom
was
disporting
himself
next
door
in
a
round
dance
that
had
but
just
begun
then
it
was
that
all
my
resolution
came
to
a
point
for
all
circumstances
looked
that
way
my
determination
to
speak
the
blessed
time
of
christmas
the
extraordinary
kindness
of
dolly
to
me
all
day
and
the
very
place
empty
yet
lighted
and
waiting
as
if
by
design
for
a
moment
after
she
had
sat
down
on
one
side
of
the
hearth
and
i
on
the
other
i
could
not
speak
for
i
seemed
to
myself
all
shaking
and
again
she
looked
such
a
child
with
her
pale
cheeks
flushed
with
the
exercise
and
her
eyes
alight
with
merriment
all
went
before
me
in
that
moment
my
old
thought
that
i
was
to
be
a
monk
my
leaving
the
novitiate
my
mission
from
rome
such
as
it
was
and
the
work
i
had
been
able
to
do
for
the
king
to
all
this
i
must
say
and
yet
this
price
i
should
pay
seemed
to
me
scarcely
to
be
considered
as
weighed
against
this
little
maid
so
it
went
by
me
like
a
picture
and
was
gone
and
i
looked
up
there
was
that
in
my
air
i
suppose
and
the
way
i
looked
at
her
that
told
her
what
my
meaning
was
for
before
i
had
spoken
even
a
syllable
she
was
on
her
feet
again
and
the
flush
was
stricken
from
her
face
oh
no
cousin
roger
she
cried
no
no
cousin
roger
it
is
yes
yes
cousin
dolly
said
i
or
at
least
i
hope
so
i
said
this
with
more
assurance
than
i
shewed
for
if
i
was
sure
of
anything
it
was
that
she
loved
me
in
return
and
i
stood
up
and
leaned
on
the
she
stood
there
staring
on
me
and
the
flush
crept
back
what
have
i
said
she
whispered
you
need
say
nothing
more
my
dear
except
what
i
bid
you
my
dear
love
you
have
guessed
just
what
it
was
that
i
had
to
say
sit
down
again
if
you
please
cousin
while
i
tell
you
as
i
looked
at
her
a
very
curious
change
came
across
her
face
i
saw
it
at
once
but
i
did
not
think
upon
it
till
afterwards
she
had
been
a
very
child
just
now
in
her
terror
that
i
should
speak
just
that
terror
i
should
suppose
that
every
maid
must
have
when
a
man
first
speaks
to
her
of
love
yet
as
i
looked
that
terror
went
from
her
face
and
her
wide
eyes
narrowed
a
little
as
she
brought
down
her
brows
and
her
parted
lips
closed
it
was
i
thought
just
that
she
had
conquered
herself
and
set
herself
to
hear
what
i
had
to
say
before
answering
me
as
i
wished
she
moved
very
slowly
back
to
her
chair
and
sat
down
crossing
her
hands
on
her
lap
that
was
all
that
i
thought
it
was
so
little
did
i
know
women
hearts
and
least
of
all
hers
i
remained
yet
a
moment
longer
leaning
my
forehead
on
my
hand
and
my
hand
flat
upon
the
tapestry
staring
into
the
red
logs
and
considering
how
to
say
what
i
had
to
say
with
the
least
alarm
to
her
i
felt
though
i
am
ashamed
to
say
it
as
it
were
something
of
condescension
towards
her
i
knew
that
it
was
a
good
match
for
her
for
had
not
her
father
drilled
that
into
me
by
a
hundred
looks
and
hints
i
knew
that
i
was
something
considerable
and
like
to
be
more
so
and
that
i
was
sacrificing
a
good
deal
for
her
sake
and
then
a
kind
of
tenderness
came
over
me
as
i
thought
how
courageous
she
was
and
good
and
simple
and
i
put
these
other
thoughts
away
and
turned
to
her
where
she
sat
with
the
firelight
on
her
chin
and
brows
and
hair
very
rigid
and
still
dolly
my
dear
i
said
i
think
you
know
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
it
is
that
i
love
you
very
dearly
as
you
must
have
seen
she
made
a
little
quick
movement
as
if
to
speak
wait
cousin
i
said
till
i
have
done
i
tell
you
that
i
love
you
very
dearly
and
honor
you
and
can
never
forget
what
you
did
for
me
and
i
am
a
man
of
a
very
considerable
estate
and
a
catholic
so
there
is
nothing
to
think
of
in
that
respect
and
your
father
too
will
be
pleased
i
know
and
we
are
again
she
made
that
little
quick
movement
and
i
stopped
well
my
dear
she
looked
up
at
me
very
quietly
well
cousin
roger
and
what
then
that
confused
me
a
little
for
i
had
thought
that
she
had
understood
and
then
i
thought
that
perhaps
she
too
was
confused
why
my
dear
i
said
very
patiently
as
i
thought
as
one
would
speak
to
a
child
i
am
asking
you
if
you
will
be
my
wife
i
turned
away
from
the
fire
altogether
and
faced
her
thinking
i
should
have
her
in
my
arms
but
at
first
she
said
nothing
at
all
but
sat
immovable
scrutinizing
me
i
thought
as
if
to
read
all
that
was
in
my
head
and
heart
but
it
was
all
new
to
me
for
what
did
i
know
of
love
except
that
it
was
very
strange
and
sweet
so
i
waited
for
her
answer
that
answer
came
cousin
roger
she
said
in
a
very
low
voice
i
am
very
sorry
you
have
spoken
as
you
have
i
straightened
myself
suddenly
and
looked
at
her
more
closely
she
had
not
moved
at
all
except
her
face
a
kind
of
roaring
murmur
began
to
fill
my
ears
because
said
she
and
every
word
of
hers
now
was
pain
to
me
because
there
is
but
one
answer
that
i
can
give
which
is
no
why
cried
i
you
have
spoken
very
kindly
and
generously
but
and
at
this
her
voice
began
to
ring
a
little
but
i
am
not
what
you
think
me
a
maid
to
be
flung
at
the
head
of
any
man
who
will
choose
to
take
her
cousin
cried
i
and
then
she
was
on
her
feet
too
her
face
all
ablaze
yes
cousin
cried
she
and
never
any
more
than
that
you
have
acted
very
well
cousin
roger
and
i
thank
you
for
that
compliment
that
you
thought
it
worth
while
to
play
the
part
and
for
your
great
kindness
to
a
poor
country
maid
i
had
thought
it
to
be
all
over
long
ago
before
you
went
away
or
i
would
not
have
behaved
as
i
have
but
since
you
have
considered
it
again
carefully
and
chosen
to
to
insult
me
after
all
i
have
no
answer
at
all
to
give
except
no
a
thousand
times
over
why
cousin
i
began
again
she
stamped
her
foot
i
could
not
have
imagined
she
could
be
so
angry
wait
till
i
have
done
she
said
i
do
not
know
what
my
father
thinks
of
me
but
i
suppose
that
you
and
he
have
designed
all
this
and
led
me
on
to
make
a
fool
of
myself
oh
let
me
go
let
me
go
oh
the
triple
fool
that
i
was
yet
who
had
ever
taught
me
the
ways
of
love
or
what
women
mean
or
what
their
hearts
are
like
if
i
had
been
one
half
the
man
that
i
thought
myself
i
would
have
seized
her
there
and
forced
back
her
foolishness
with
kisses
and
vowed
that
conspirator
or
not
she
must
have
me
that
we
knew
one
another
too
well
to
play
false
coin
like
this
or
i
should
have
blazed
at
her
in
return
and
told
her
that
she
lied
in
thinking
i
was
as
base
as
that
why
i
should
have
just
borne
myself
like
a
lover
to
whom
love
is
all
and
dignity
and
wounded
pride
nothing
for
what
else
is
there
but
love
sacred
or
profane
in
the
whole
world
that
god
has
made
if
i
had
done
that
if
only
i
had
done
that
then
but
i
suppose
that
i
was
no
lover
then
so
i
drew
back
smarting
and
wounded
and
let
her
go
by
and
a
minute
later
i
heard
the
door
of
her
chamber
slam
behind
her
and
the
key
turn
for
myself
i
went
out
very
slowly
five
minutes
after
and
upstairs
to
my
own
chamber
and
began
to
consider
what
things
i
must
take
with
me
on
the
morrow
for
i
would
not
stay
another
day
in
the
house
where
i
had
been
so
insulted
and
denied
chapter
viii
pride
is
a
very
good
salve
when
one
has
no
humility
and
it
was
pride
that
i
applied
to
myself
to
heal
the
wounds
i
had
i
came
down
again
to
the
great
chamber
half
an
hour
later
very
cold
and
dignified
and
danced
again
like
the
solemn
fool
that
i
was
first
with
one
and
then
with
another
and
all
the
while
i
told
myself
like
the
prophet
that
i
did
well
to
be
angry
and
that
i
would
shew
her
that
no
man
of
my
ability
could
depend
upon
any
mere
woman
for
his
content
yet
the
pain
at
my
heart
was
miserable
it
is
very
near
incredible
to
me
now
how
i
who
truly
knew
something
of
the
world
and
of
men
and
of
affairs
could
be
so
childish
and
ignorant
in
a
matter
of
this
sort
in
truth
this
was
what
i
was
i
knew
nothing
of
true
love
at
all
how
therefore
should
i
be
a
proper
lover
i
saw
my
cousin
tom
who
mopped
himself
a
great
deal
eyeing
me
now
and
again
and
he
presently
came
up
and
asked
me
where
dolly
was
in
her
chamber
i
think
said
i
with
my
nose
in
the
air
and
with
such
a
manner
that
he
said
no
more
it
was
enough
to
break
my
heart
to
continue
dancing
but
it
was
the
task
i
had
set
myself
upstairs
and
till
near
ten
we
continued
to
dance
but
no
dolly
to
help
us
i
had
even
determined
how
i
should
bear
myself
if
she
came
and
how
superb
should
be
my
dignity
but
she
did
not
come
to
see
it
we
ended
with
singing
here
a
health
unto
his
majesty
and
i
took
care
that
my
voice
should
be
loud
so
that
she
should
hear
it
i
had
even
poor
fool
that
i
was
walked
heavily
past
her
just
now
that
she
might
hear
me
go
when
all
were
gone
away
at
last
i
waited
for
my
cousin
tom
and
then
went
with
him
into
the
parlour
where
i
told
him
very
briefly
all
that
had
passed
with
the
same
dignity
that
i
had
set
myself
to
preserve
i
even
spoke
in
a
high
sort
of
voice
to
shew
my
and
detachment
my
cousin
tom
appeared
as
if
thunderstruck
good
god
said
he
the
minx
to
behave
like
that
it
is
no
longer
any
concern
of
mine
i
said
for
myself
i
shall
go
back
to
town
but
began
he
my
dear
cousin
i
said
it
is
the
only
thing
that
i
can
do
to
set
to
work
again
mistress
dorothy
must
recover
herself
alone
i
could
not
expect
her
to
tolerate
such
a
personage
as
i
must
appear
in
her
eyes
but
you
will
came
back
again
said
tom
and
i
talk
to
the
chit
as
she
deserves
i
preserved
my
lofty
attitude
that
again
said
i
is
no
concern
of
mine
and
as
for
coming
back
when
mistress
dorothy
has
found
her
a
husband
whom
she
can
respect
we
may
perhaps
consider
it
he
sat
very
silent
for
a
while
after
that
and
i
know
now
though
i
did
not
know
then
what
was
the
design
he
was
considering
at
least
i
suppose
it
was
then
that
he
saw
it
clear
before
him
at
the
time
i
thought
he
was
giving
his
attention
to
myself
and
i
wondered
a
little
that
he
did
not
press
me
again
to
stay
though
i
would
not
have
done
so
it
was
a
very
desolate
morning
when
i
awakened
next
day
and
knew
what
had
happened
and
that
i
must
go
away
again
from
the
house
i
had
learned
so
much
to
love
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
as
i
put
on
my
clothes
i
put
on
my
pride
with
them
and
came
down
very
cold
and
haughty
to
get
my
morning
as
we
called
it
in
the
before
riding
and
there
in
the
was
my
cousin
dolly
whom
i
had
thought
to
be
in
her
chamber
as
the
door
was
shut
when
i
came
past
it
we
bade
one
another
good
morning
very
courteously
indeed
but
we
gave
no
other
salute
to
one
another
she
knew
last
night
that
i
was
going
as
my
cousin
tom
had
told
her
maid
to
tell
her
and
i
was
surprised
that
she
was
there
presently
i
had
an
explanation
of
it
cousin
roger
said
she
i
was
very
angry
last
night
and
i
wished
to
tell
you
i
was
sorry
for
that
and
for
the
hard
words
i
used
before
you
went
away
i
bowed
my
head
very
dignifiedly
and
i
too
i
said
must
ask
your
pardon
for
so
taking
you
by
surprise
i
thought
and
then
i
ceased
she
had
looked
a
little
white
and
tired
i
thought
but
she
flushed
again
with
anger
when
i
said
that
you
thought
it
would
be
no
surprise
she
said
i
did
not
say
so
cousin
said
i
you
have
no
right
to
interpret
but
you
thought
it
i
drank
my
ale
oh
what
you
must
think
of
me
she
cried
in
a
sudden
passion
and
ran
out
of
the
room
i
think
that
was
the
most
disconsolate
journey
i
have
ever
taken
it
was
a
cold
morning
with
a
fine
rain
falling
my
man
james
was
disconsolate
too
and
i
remembered
the
when
i
saw
it
and
i
was
leaving
the
one
place
i
had
begun
to
think
of
as
my
home
and
her
who
had
so
much
made
it
home
to
me
i
had
not
even
seen
her
again
before
i
went
and
our
last
words
had
been
of
anger
and
of
that
chopping
kind
of
argument
that
satisfies
no
one
i
tried
to
distract
myself
with
other
thoughts
of
what
i
was
going
to
for
i
had
determined
to
go
straight
to
whitehall
and
ask
for
some
employment
yet
back
and
back
again
came
the
memories
and
little
scenes
of
the
house
and
the
appearance
of
the
great
chamber
when
it
was
all
lit
up
and
of
the
figure
of
that
little
maid
who
had
so
angered
me
and
the
way
she
carried
her
head
and
the
turns
of
her
hand
and
how
happy
we
all
were
yesterday
about
this
time
however
i
need
not
enlarge
upon
that
those
that
have
ever
so
suffered
will
know
what
i
thought
without
more
words
and
those
who
have
not
suffered
would
not
understand
though
i
used
ten
thousand
and
every
step
of
all
the
way
to
london
which
we
reached
about
six
spoke
to
me
of
her
with
whom
i
had
once
ridden
along
it
as
we
came
up
into
covent
garden
i
turned
to
my
man
james
and
gave
him
more
confidence
than
i
had
ever
given
to
him
before
for
i
think
that
he
knew
what
had
happened
james
said
i
this
is
a
very
poor
but
it
is
not
my
fault
though
fortune
so
far
had
been
against
me
i
must
confess
that
it
favoured
me
a
little
better
afterwards
for
when
i
went
in
to
chiffinch
on
the
next
morning
he
gave
me
the
very
news
that
i
wished
to
hear
mallock
he
said
you
are
the
very
man
i
most
wished
to
see
there
is
a
great
pother
in
france
again
i
do
not
know
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
the
affair
but
his
majesty
is
very
anxious
he
spoke
of
you
only
this
morning
mr
mallock
my
heart
quickened
a
little
in
spite
of
my
pain
it
was
a
pleasure
to
hear
that
his
majesty
had
spoken
of
me
for
i
think
my
love
to
him
was
very
much
more
deep
in
one
way
though
not
in
another
than
even
to
dolly
herself
chiffinch
said
i
i
will
be
very
plain
with
you
i
have
had
a
disappointment
and
i
came
back
to
town
he
whistled
with
a
witty
look
the
pretty
cousin
he
said
i
could
not
afford
to
quarrel
with
him
but
i
could
keep
my
dignity
that
is
my
affair
chiffinch
however
there
is
the
fact
i
am
come
to
town
for
this
very
purpose
to
beg
for
something
to
do
will
his
majesty
see
me
he
looked
at
me
for
an
instant
then
he
thought
better
i
think
of
any
further
rallying
why
i
am
sure
he
will
but
it
will
not
be
for
a
few
days
yet
there
is
a
hundred
businesses
at
christmas
can
you
employ
yourself
till
then
i
can
kick
my
heels
i
suppose
said
i
as
well
as
any
man
that
will
do
very
well
said
chiffinch
but
i
warn
you
that
i
think
it
will
be
a
long
affair
his
majesty
hath
entangled
himself
terribly
and
monsieur
barillon
is
furious
the
longer
the
better
said
i
on
the
i
went
down
to
see
my
lord
stafford
die
i
was
in
so
distracted
a
mood
that
i
must
see
something
or
go
mad
for
i
had
heard
that
it
would
not
be
until
the
evening
of
that
day
that
his
majesty
would
see
me
and
that
i
must
be
ready
to
ride
for
dover
on
the
next
morning
chiffinch
had
told
me
enough
to
shew
that
the
business
would
be
yet
more
subtle
and
delicate
than
the
last
and
that
i
might
expect
some
very
considerable
recognition
if
i
carried
it
through
rightly
i
longed
to
be
at
it
one
half
of
my
longing
came
from
the
desire
to
occupy
my
mind
with
something
better
than
my
poor
bungled
and
the
other
half
from
a
frantic
kind
of
determination
to
shew
my
mistress
dolly
that
i
was
better
than
she
thought
me
and
that
i
was
man
enough
to
attend
to
my
affairs
and
carry
them
out
competently
even
if
i
were
not
man
enough
to
marry
her
it
must
be
understood
that
i
shewed
no
signs
of
this
to
anyone
and
scarcely
allowed
it
even
to
myself
but
speaking
with
that
honesty
which
i
have
endeavoured
to
preserve
throughout
all
these
memoirs
i
am
bound
to
say
that
my
mind
was
in
very
much
that
condition
of
childish
anger
and
resentment
i
had
a
name
as
a
strong
man
god
only
knew
how
weak
i
was
for
i
did
not
even
know
it
myself
there
was
a
great
crowd
on
tower
hill
to
see
my
lord
execution
for
not
only
was
he
well
known
although
as
i
have
said
not
greatly
beloved
but
the
rumours
were
got
about
and
that
they
were
true
enough
i
knew
from
chiffinch
that
he
had
said
very
strange
things
about
my
lord
shaftesbury
and
how
he
could
save
his
own
life
if
he
willed
not
by
confessing
anything
of
which
he
himself
had
been
accused
but
by
relating
certain
matters
in
which
my
lord
shaftesbury
was
concerned
however
he
did
not
yet
the
tale
had
gone
about
that
perhaps
he
would
and
that
a
reprieve
might
come
even
upon
the
scaffold
itself
when
i
came
to
tower
hill
on
horseback
about
nine
the
crowd
covered
the
most
of
it
but
i
drove
my
horse
through
a
little
so
that
i
could
have
a
fair
sight
both
of
the
scaffold
and
of
the
way
kept
clear
by
soldiers
along
which
the
prisoner
must
come
i
had
not
been
there
above
a
few
minutes
when
a
company
went
by
and
in
the
midst
the
two
sheriffs
on
horseback
whose
business
it
was
to
carry
through
the
execution
and
they
drew
up
outside
the
gate
to
preserve
the
liberties
of
the
tower
while
they
were
waiting
i
watched
those
that
were
upon
the
scaffold
two
writers
to
take
down
all
that
was
said
and
the
headsman
with
his
axe
in
a
cloth
but
this
he
presently
uncovered
and
the
block
which
he
laid
down
upon
the
black
baize
put
ready
for
it
and
for
the
prisoner
to
lie
down
upon
then
the
coffin
was
put
up
behind
with
but
the
two
letters
as
i
heard
afterwards
and
the
year
then
as
a
murmur
broke
out
in
the
crowd
i
turned
and
there
was
my
lord
coming
along
walking
with
a
staff
between
his
guards
with
the
sheriffs
of
whom
cornish
was
one
and
bethell
the
other
and
the
rest
following
after
when
my
lord
was
come
up
on
the
scaffold
the
headsman
had
gone
again
but
he
asked
for
him
and
gave
him
some
money
at
which
the
man
seemed
very
discontented
whereupon
he
gave
him
some
more
it
is
a
very
curious
custom
this
but
i
think
it
is
that
the
headsman
may
strike
straight
and
not
make
a
botch
of
it
when
my
lord
turned
again
i
could
see
his
face
very
plainly
he
wore
a
peruke
and
his
hat
upon
that
he
was
in
a
dark
suit
plain
but
rich
and
had
rings
upon
his
fingers
which
i
could
see
as
he
spoke
he
was
wonderfully
upright
for
a
man
of
his
age
and
his
face
shewed
no
perturbation
at
all
though
it
was
more
fallen
than
i
had
thought
he
read
all
his
speech
very
clearly
from
a
paper
he
took
out
of
his
pocket
but
as
he
delivered
copies
of
it
to
the
sheriffs
and
the
writers
and
it
was
put
in
print
too
on
the
very
same
day
by
two
i
need
not
give
it
here
he
declared
his
innocence
most
emphatically
calling
god
to
witness
and
he
thanked
god
that
his
death
was
come
on
him
in
such
a
way
that
he
could
prepare
himself
well
for
eternity
but
he
did
not
thank
the
king
for
remitting
the
penalties
of
treason
as
he
might
have
done
he
made
no
great
references
as
was
expected
that
he
would
to
disclosures
that
he
might
have
made
but
only
in
general
terms
he
denied
most
strongly
that
it
was
any
part
of
the
catholic
religion
to
give
or
receive
indulgences
for
murder
or
for
any
other
sin
and
he
ended
by
committing
his
soul
into
the
hands
of
jesus
christ
by
whose
merits
and
passion
he
hoped
to
be
saved
his
voice
was
thin
but
very
clear
for
so
old
a
man
and
the
crowd
listened
to
him
with
respect
and
attention
i
think
all
those
catholic
deaths
and
the
speeches
that
the
prisoners
make
will
by
and
by
begin
to
affect
public
opinion
and
lead
men
to
reflect
that
those
who
stand
in
the
immediate
presence
of
god
are
not
likely
one
after
another
to
go
before
him
with
lies
upon
their
lips
when
he
was
done
he
distributed
the
copies
of
his
speech
and
then
presently
kneeled
down
and
read
a
prayer
or
two
they
were
in
latin
but
i
could
not
hear
the
words
distinctly
when
he
rose
up
again
all
observing
him
he
went
to
the
rail
and
spoke
aloud
god
bless
you
gentlemen
he
said
god
preserve
his
majesty
he
is
as
good
a
prince
as
ever
governed
you
obey
him
as
faithfully
as
i
have
done
and
god
bless
you
all
gentlemen
it
was
very
affecting
to
hear
him
speak
so
for
he
did
it
very
emphatically
but
even
then
one
of
their
ministers
that
was
on
the
scaffold
would
not
let
him
be
sir
he
asked
speaking
loud
all
across
the
scaffold
do
you
disown
the
indulgences
of
the
romish
church
my
lord
turned
round
suddenly
in
a
great
passion
sir
he
cried
what
have
you
to
do
with
my
religion
however
i
do
say
that
the
church
of
rome
allows
no
indulgences
for
murder
lying
and
the
like
and
whatever
i
have
said
is
true
what
cried
the
minister
have
you
received
no
absolution
i
have
received
none
at
all
said
my
lord
more
quietly
meaning
of
the
kind
that
the
minister
meant
for
i
have
no
doubt
at
all
that
he
made
his
confession
in
the
tower
you
said
that
you
never
saw
those
witnesses
asked
the
minister
who
i
think
must
have
been
a
little
uneasy
i
never
saw
any
of
them
said
my
lord
but
dugdale
and
that
was
at
a
time
when
i
spoke
to
him
about
a
this
was
at
tixall
when
dugdale
was
bailiff
there
to
my
lord
aston
they
let
him
alone
after
that
and
he
immediately
began
to
prepare
himself
for
death
first
he
took
off
his
watch
and
his
rings
and
gave
them
to
two
or
three
of
his
friends
who
were
on
the
scaffold
with
him
then
he
took
his
staff
which
was
against
the
rail
and
gave
that
too
and
last
his
crucifix
which
he
took
with
its
chain
from
around
his
neck
his
man
then
came
up
to
him
and
very
respectfully
helped
him
off
with
his
peruke
first
and
then
his
coat
laying
them
one
on
the
other
in
a
corner
my
lord
head
looked
very
thin
and
shrunken
when
that
was
done
as
it
were
a
bird
head
then
his
man
came
up
again
with
a
black
silk
cap
to
put
his
hair
under
which
was
rather
long
and
very
grey
and
thin
and
he
did
it
and
then
his
man
disposed
his
waistcoat
and
shirt
pulling
them
down
and
turning
them
back
a
little
then
my
lord
looked
this
way
and
that
for
an
instant
and
then
went
forward
to
the
black
baize
and
kneeled
on
it
with
his
man
help
and
then
laid
himself
down
flat
putting
his
chin
over
the
block
which
was
not
above
five
or
six
inches
high
yet
no
one
moved
and
the
headsman
stood
waiting
in
a
corner
with
his
axe
one
of
the
sheriffs
cornish
i
think
it
was
said
something
to
the
headsman
but
i
could
not
hear
what
it
was
and
then
i
saw
my
lord
kneel
upright
again
and
then
stand
up
i
think
he
was
a
little
deaf
and
had
not
heard
what
was
said
why
what
do
you
want
he
said
what
sign
will
you
give
asked
cornish
no
sign
at
all
take
your
own
time
god
will
be
done
said
my
lord
and
again
applied
himself
to
the
block
his
man
helping
him
as
before
and
then
standing
back
i
hope
you
forgive
me
said
the
headsman
before
he
was
down
i
do
said
my
lord
and
that
was
the
last
word
that
he
spoke
for
the
headsman
immediately
stepped
up
so
soon
as
he
was
down
and
with
one
blow
cut
his
head
all
off
except
a
bit
of
skin
which
he
cut
through
with
his
knife
then
he
lifted
up
the
head
and
carried
it
to
the
four
sides
of
the
scaffold
by
the
hair
crying
here
is
the
head
of
a
traitor
as
the
custom
was
my
lord
face
looked
very
peaceful
i
rode
home
again
alone
thinking
of
what
i
had
seen
and
the
innocent
blood
that
was
being
shed
and
wondering
whether
this
might
not
be
the
last
shed
for
that
miserable
falsehood
but
even
after
that
sight
the
thought
of
my
cousin
dorothy
was
never
very
far
away
and
before
i
was
home
again
i
was
once
more
thinking
of
her
more
than
of
that
from
which
i
was
just
come
or
of
that
to
which
i
was
going
for
i
was
to
see
his
majesty
that
evening
and
so
to
france
next
day
part
iii
chapter
i
it
was
on
a
very
stormy
evening
ten
months
later
that
i
rode
again
into
london
on
my
way
from
rome
and
paris
now
here
again
i
must
omit
altogether
except
on
one
or
two
very
general
points
all
that
had
passed
since
i
had
gone
away
on
the
day
after
my
lord
stafford
execution
on
tower
hill
it
is
enough
to
say
that
i
had
done
my
business
in
paris
very
much
to
his
satisfaction
as
well
as
to
that
of
others
and
that
barillon
himself
had
urged
me
to
stay
there
altogether
saying
that
i
could
make
a
career
for
myself
there
as
the
romans
say
such
as
i
could
never
make
in
england
but
i
would
not
though
i
must
confess
that
i
was
very
much
tempted
to
it
and
i
know
now
though
i
did
not
know
it
altogether
then
that
there
were
just
two
things
that
prevented
me
and
these
were
that
his
majesty
and
my
cousin
dorothy
were
in
england
and
not
france
of
my
cousin
dorothy
i
had
heard
scarcely
anything
at
all
for
the
last
letter
i
had
had
from
hare
street
was
at
eastertide
and
tom
said
not
very
much
about
his
daughter
except
that
she
was
pretty
well
and
that
he
thought
of
taking
her
to
town
in
the
summer
for
a
little
the
rest
of
his
letter
was
of
it
all
about
hare
street
and
the
lambs
and
how
the
fruit
promised
and
of
the
affairs
of
the
kingdom
these
affairs
of
which
i
learned
from
other
sources
besides
my
cousin
tom
were
in
brief
as
follows
his
majesty
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
come
to
the
throne
had
shewn
an
extraordinary
open
courage
in
dealing
with
the
i
must
confess
that
my
success
in
france
was
not
wholly
without
connection
with
this
he
was
so
much
strengthened
in
french
affairs
that
he
felt
i
suppose
that
he
could
act
more
strongly
at
home
first
in
january
he
had
dissolved
the
parliament
that
had
threatened
the
exclusion
of
the
duke
of
york
and
that
would
vote
him
no
money
till
he
would
yield
first
he
prorogued
it
though
there
was
a
great
clamour
in
his
very
presence
and
then
he
dissolved
it
coming
in
so
early
in
the
morning
that
none
suspected
his
design
then
he
summoned
a
new
parliament
to
meet
at
oxford
for
at
oxford
he
knew
he
would
have
the
support
of
the
city
whereas
at
london
he
had
not
that
parliament
at
oxford
will
never
be
forgotten
i
think
for
it
was
more
like
an
armed
camp
than
a
parliament
both
parties
went
armed
my
lord
shaftesbury
in
order
to
rouse
the
feeling
on
his
side
went
there
in
a
borrowed
coach
without
his
liveries
as
if
he
feared
arrest
or
even
death
but
his
majesty
answered
that
by
himself
going
with
all
his
guards
about
him
as
if
for
the
same
reason
there
were
continual
brawls
in
the
city
and
duels
too
the
parties
went
about
like
companies
of
cats
and
dogs
snarling
and
spitting
at
one
another
continually
and
so
fierce
was
the
feeling
that
nothing
could
be
done
my
lord
shaftesbury
creatures
were
still
strong
enough
to
hold
their
own
and
at
last
his
majesty
did
the
bravest
thing
he
had
ever
done
he
caused
a
to
be
brought
privately
to
his
lodgings
and
his
crown
and
robes
to
be
put
in
there
then
he
went
in
himself
and
away
to
where
the
house
of
lords
was
sitting
and
before
anyone
could
utter
a
word
he
dissolved
the
parliament
once
more
and
altogether
and
never
again
summoned
another
but
that
was
not
all
first
it
appeared
as
if
even
his
majesty
himself
was
frightened
at
what
he
had
done
for
he
allowed
my
lord
archbishop
of
armagh
oliver
plunket
to
be
convicted
and
executed
in
london
clean
contrary
to
all
evidence
or
right
or
justice
just
because
he
was
a
papist
and
the
popular
cry
had
been
raised
against
him
that
he
was
conspiring
to
bring
the
french
over
to
ireland
whereas
he
was
a
good
and
kindly
old
man
who
lived
in
the
greatest
simplicity
and
neither
did
nor
designed
harm
to
any
living
creature
i
do
not
know
whether
it
was
the
name
that
frightened
the
king
but
certainly
at
that
time
i
was
engaged
on
his
behalf
in
some
transactions
with
that
country
which
would
have
ruined
him
had
they
ever
been
known
but
then
he
recovered
himself
after
the
sacrifice
of
one
more
catholic
and
did
what
he
should
have
done
a
great
while
ago
and
caused
my
lord
shaftesbury
to
be
arrested
and
sent
to
the
tower
on
a
charge
of
fomenting
insurrection
which
was
precisely
what
my
lord
had
been
doing
for
the
last
two
years
at
least
but
his
majesty
scheme
fell
through
for
the
sheriffs
who
were
whigs
and
on
my
lord
side
therefore
packed
the
grand
jury
of
the
city
and
acquitted
him
then
there
was
another
affair
of
which
i
in
my
business
in
france
saw
something
of
the
other
side
my
negotiations
were
coming
to
a
successful
end
when
news
came
over
to
paris
that
the
prince
william
of
orange
was
in
england
and
made
much
of
by
his
majesty
this
last
was
a
lie
but
i
wrote
across
to
his
majesty
of
what
a
bad
impression
such
a
rumour
made
and
urged
him
to
make
amends
which
he
did
very
handsomely
the
duke
of
monmouth
too
was
back
again
in
london
and
so
was
the
duke
of
york
so
the
were
all
again
for
the
present
on
the
squares
on
which
the
game
had
begun
it
was
also
a
little
satisfaction
to
me
to
hear
that
her
grace
of
portsmouth
had
urged
the
duke
of
york
return
for
i
thought
myself
not
a
little
responsible
for
her
change
of
face
once
again
however
the
duke
returned
to
finish
affairs
in
scotland
and
then
came
back
to
court
and
it
was
on
his
journey
there
that
the
was
wrecked
and
his
royal
highness
so
nearly
drowned
the
duke
of
monmouth
however
saw
that
affairs
were
moving
against
him
so
he
determined
on
a
very
bold
stroke
and
after
returning
to
england
once
more
without
his
majesty
leave
went
through
all
the
country
as
if
on
a
royal
progress
and
it
was
astonishing
how
well
he
was
received
it
was
then
that
chiffinch
wrote
to
me
at
length
telling
me
of
the
spies
he
had
sent
to
follow
the
duke
everywhere
and
asking
whether
i
would
not
come
over
myself
to
help
in
it
but
i
was
just
considering
whether
i
would
not
go
to
rome
and
indeed
before
i
could
make
up
my
mind
another
letter
came
saying
that
the
duke
was
to
be
arrested
and
then
let
out
on
bail
and
that
he
could
do
no
more
harm
for
the
present
so
i
went
to
rome
and
there
i
stayed
a
good
while
reporting
myself
and
all
that
i
had
done
and
being
received
very
graciously
by
those
who
had
sent
me
since
then
not
very
much
of
public
import
had
happened
until
in
the
first
week
in
november
i
received
in
paris
a
very
urgent
letter
from
chiffinch
telling
me
to
return
at
once
but
no
more
in
it
than
that
it
was
a
very
stormy
night
as
i
have
said
when
i
rode
in
over
london
bridge
to
where
the
lights
of
the
city
shone
over
the
water
i
was
very
content
at
my
coming
for
in
spite
of
all
my
resolutions
it
was
a
terrible
kind
of
happiness
to
me
to
be
in
the
same
country
and
so
near
to
her
too
as
was
my
cousin
dorothy
i
had
striven
to
put
her
out
of
my
head
i
had
occupied
myself
with
that
which
is
the
greatest
of
all
sports
and
that
is
the
game
that
kings
play
in
secret
i
had
become
something
of
a
personage
and
rode
now
with
four
servants
instead
of
one
yet
never
could
i
forget
her
but
i
was
resolved
to
play
no
more
with
such
nonsense
to
live
altogether
in
london
and
to
send
my
men
in
a
day
or
two
to
get
my
things
from
hare
street
it
often
appears
to
me
very
strange
when
i
see
some
great
man
go
by
whose
name
is
in
all
mouths
for
some
office
he
holds
or
for
his
great
wealth
or
power
to
reflect
that
he
has
his
secret
interests
as
much
as
any
and
is
moved
by
them
far
more
deeply
than
by
those
public
matters
for
which
men
think
that
he
cares
i
was
not
yet
a
great
personage
though
i
meant
to
be
so
and
my
name
was
in
no
men
mouths
for
it
was
of
the
very
essence
of
what
i
did
that
it
should
not
be
yet
i
was
held
in
high
consideration
by
two
kings
but
for
all
that
as
i
turned
westwards
from
london
bridge
i
looked
northwards
up
gracechurch
street
and
longed
to
be
riding
to
hare
street
rather
than
to
whitehall
it
was
strange
and
yet
very
familiar
too
to
go
up
those
stairs
again
all
alone
for
i
had
sent
my
men
on
to
covent
garden
where
i
had
taken
two
sets
of
lodgings
now
instead
of
one
to
tell
the
servant
that
chiffinch
looked
for
me
and
to
be
conducted
by
him
straight
through
to
the
private
closet
where
he
awaited
me
over
his
papers
i
was
in
my
boots
all
splashed
and
very
weary
indeed
yet
i
had
learned
ever
since
the
day
when
his
majesty
had
found
fault
with
me
so
long
ago
never
to
delay
even
by
five
minutes
when
kings
call
well
i
said
as
i
came
in
well
said
he
and
took
me
by
the
hands
now
it
may
seem
surprising
that
i
could
tolerate
such
a
man
as
was
chiffinch
still
more
that
i
should
have
become
on
such
terms
with
him
the
truth
is
that
i
regarded
him
as
two
men
and
not
one
on
the
one
side
he
was
the
spy
the
servant
the
panderer
to
the
king
more
disgraceful
secrets
on
the
other
he
was
a
man
of
an
extraordinary
shrewdness
utterly
devoted
to
his
majesty
and
very
competent
indeed
in
very
considerable
affairs
if
ever
the
secret
memoirs
of
charles
ii
see
the
light
of
day
chiffinch
will
be
honoured
and
admired
as
well
as
contemned
first
sup
he
said
i
have
all
ready
and
not
one
word
till
you
are
done
he
took
me
through
into
a
little
that
was
opposite
the
closet
and
here
was
all
that
a
hungry
man
might
desire
of
cold
meats
and
wine
he
had
had
it
set
out
he
told
me
ever
since
five
for
i
had
sent
to
tell
him
i
would
be
there
that
night
while
i
ate
he
would
say
nothing
at
all
of
the
business
on
hand
but
talked
only
of
france
and
what
i
had
done
there
he
told
me
the
king
was
very
greatly
pleased
and
there
were
rewards
if
i
wished
them
or
even
a
title
though
he
was
not
sure
of
what
kind
for
i
was
a
very
young
man
he
vows
you
have
done
a
thousand
times
more
than
the
duchess
of
portsmouth
in
all
her
time
but
i
would
recommend
you
to
take
nothing
it
will
not
be
forgotten
you
may
be
sure
if
you
took
anything
now
it
would
make
you
known
and
ruin
half
your
work
if
you
will
take
my
advice
mallock
you
will
tell
the
king
bye
and
bye
and
have
a
peerage
when
the
time
comes
now
of
course
these
thoughts
had
crossed
my
mind
too
but
it
was
more
to
hear
them
from
a
man
like
this
i
nodded
at
him
but
said
nothing
feigning
that
my
mouth
was
full
for
indeed
i
did
not
quite
know
what
to
say
i
need
not
say
that
the
thought
of
my
cousin
dorothy
came
to
me
again
very
forcibly
at
least
i
should
have
shewn
her
what
i
could
do
when
i
was
quite
done
chiffinch
carried
me
back
to
the
parlour
and
there
having
locked
the
door
he
told
me
what
was
wanted
of
me
when
he
had
done
i
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
you
are
as
sure
as
that
i
said
we
are
sure
beyond
the
very
leastest
doubt
that
at
last
there
is
a
plot
to
kill
the
king
there
are
rumours
and
rumours
well
these
are
of
the
right
kind
and
we
are
convinced
that
my
lord
shaftesbury
is
behind
it
and
my
lord
essex
and
sidney
and
who
else
we
do
not
know
my
men
whom
i
sent
to
spy
out
how
monmouth
was
received
in
the
country
tell
me
the
same
but
the
trouble
is
that
we
have
no
proof
at
all
and
can
not
lay
a
finger
on
them
and
there
is
only
that
way
that
i
told
you
of
to
find
it
out
that
i
should
mix
with
them
feign
to
be
one
of
them
said
i
the
man
threw
out
his
hands
mallock
he
said
i
told
the
king
you
were
too
nice
for
it
he
said
on
the
contrary
that
he
was
sure
you
would
do
it
that
it
was
not
a
matter
of
niceness
but
of
plot
against
counterplot
a
pretty
simile
i
said
with
some
irony
for
i
confess
i
did
not
like
the
idea
though
i
was
far
from
sure
i
would
not
do
it
in
the
end
one
army
is
besieging
a
castle
or
town
said
he
mines
beneath
the
ground
after
nightfall
secretly
is
it
underhand
action
to
do
the
same
and
to
countermine
them
but
i
said
i
was
not
sure
what
you
would
think
of
it
you
see
mallock
i
scarcely
know
a
single
person
who
unites
the
qualities
that
you
do
we
must
have
a
gentleman
or
he
would
never
be
accepted
by
them
and
he
must
be
a
shrewd
man
too
well
i
will
not
say
we
have
no
shrewd
gentlemen
but
what
shrewd
gentlemen
have
we
think
you
who
are
not
perfectly
known
and
their
politics
the
duchess
of
portsmouth
knows
me
said
i
beginning
to
hesitate
but
she
does
not
know
one
word
of
this
affair
nor
will
they
tell
her
she
is
far
too
loyal
for
that
but
she
will
have
told
others
what
i
am
it
is
not
likely
mallock
we
must
take
our
chance
of
it
truly
i
see
no
one
for
it
but
yourself
i
would
not
have
sent
for
you
if
i
had
for
you
were
very
useful
in
france
but
the
difficulty
is
you
see
that
we
can
take
no
observable
precautions
we
have
doubled
the
guards
inside
the
palace
at
night
but
we
dare
not
in
the
day
for
if
that
were
known
they
would
suspect
that
we
knew
all
and
would
be
on
their
guard
as
it
is
they
have
no
idea
that
we
know
anything
how
do
they
mean
to
do
it
that
again
we
do
not
know
if
they
can
find
a
fanatic
and
there
are
plenty
of
the
old
covenanting
blood
left
they
might
shoot
his
majesty
as
he
sits
at
supper
or
they
may
drag
him
out
of
his
coach
one
day
as
they
did
with
archbishop
sharpe
or
they
might
poison
him
i
have
the
cook
always
to
taste
the
dishes
before
they
come
into
hall
but
who
can
guard
against
so
many
avenues
i
sat
considering
but
i
was
so
weary
that
i
knew
i
could
decide
nothing
rightly
on
the
one
side
the
thing
appealed
to
me
for
there
was
danger
in
it
and
what
does
a
young
man
love
like
that
and
there
was
a
great
compliment
in
it
for
me
that
i
should
be
the
one
man
they
had
for
the
affair
yet
it
did
not
sound
to
me
very
like
work
for
a
gentleman
to
feign
to
be
a
conspirator
to
win
confidence
and
then
to
betray
it
in
however
a
good
cause
what
astonished
me
most
however
was
the
thought
that
the
had
waxed
as
desperate
as
this
certainly
their
tide
was
going
down
as
i
had
heard
in
france
but
i
did
not
know
it
was
gone
so
low
as
this
and
that
they
who
had
lied
and
perjured
themselves
over
the
oates
falsehoods
and
had
used
them
and
had
kept
the
people
suspicions
alive
and
had
professed
such
loyalty
and
had
been
the
cause
of
so
much
bloodshedding
that
these
men
should
now
upon
their
side
enter
upon
the
very
design
that
they
had
accused
the
catholics
of
this
was
very
nearly
enough
to
decide
me
well
said
i
you
must
give
me
hours
to
determine
in
i
am
drawn
two
ways
i
do
not
know
what
to
do
i
can
assure
you
said
the
page
eagerly
that
his
majesty
would
give
you
almost
anything
you
asked
for
if
you
did
this
and
were
successful
i
pursed
my
lips
up
perhaps
he
would
i
said
but
i
do
not
know
that
i
want
very
much
then
he
would
give
you
all
the
more
i
stood
up
to
take
my
leave
well
sir
i
said
i
must
go
home
again
and
to
bed
i
am
tired
out
i
will
be
with
you
again
at
the
same
time
he
rose
to
take
me
to
the
outer
door
you
will
not
want
to
go
to
hare
street
this
time
he
said
smiling
to
hare
street
i
said
why
should
i
go
there
well
the
pretty
cousin
said
he
i
set
my
teeth
i
did
not
like
chiffinch
familiarities
well
then
why
should
i
not
go
i
asked
why
she
is
here
did
you
not
know
here
in
london
aye
in
whitehall
i
saw
her
only
yesterday
in
whitehall
what
do
you
mean
mr
chiffinch
i
suppose
my
face
went
white
i
knew
that
my
heart
beat
like
a
hammer
why
what
i
say
said
he
why
do
you
look
like
that
mr
mallock
tell
me
i
cried
tell
me
this
instant
why
she
is
maid
of
honour
to
her
majesty
the
duchess
of
portsmouth
is
protecting
her
where
is
she
why
is
she
she
is
with
the
rest
i
suppose
mallock
mallock
where
are
you
going
but
i
was
gone
chapter
ii
when
i
was
out
in
the
air
i
stopped
short
and
then
remembering
that
chiffinch
would
be
after
me
perhaps
and
would
try
to
prevent
me
i
went
on
as
quick
as
i
could
turned
a
corner
or
two
in
that
maze
of
passages
and
stopped
again
as
yet
i
had
no
idea
as
to
what
to
do
my
brain
burned
with
horror
and
fury
and
i
stood
there
in
the
dark
clenching
my
hands
again
and
again
with
my
whip
in
one
of
them
it
was
enough
for
me
that
my
cousin
dolly
was
in
that
den
of
tigers
and
serpents
that
was
called
the
court
and
under
the
protection
of
the
woman
once
called
carwell
there
was
not
one
thought
in
my
brain
but
this
all
others
were
gone
or
were
but
as
phantoms
the
king
the
duke
monmouth
the
queen
they
would
be
so
many
wicked
ghosts
and
no
more
before
me
and
i
would
go
through
them
as
through
smoke
to
tear
her
out
of
it
i
suppose
that
some
species
of
sanity
returned
to
me
after
a
while
for
i
found
myself
presently
pacing
up
and
down
the
terrace
by
the
river
and
considering
that
this
was
a
strange
hour
eight
at
night
to
be
searching
out
one
of
her
majesty
ladies
and
after
that
little
by
little
persons
and
matters
began
to
take
their
right
proportions
on
them
again
i
could
not
i
perceived
merely
demand
where
mistress
jermyn
lodged
beat
down
her
door
and
carry
her
away
with
me
safe
to
hare
street
their
majesties
of
england
still
stood
for
something
in
whitehall
and
so
did
reason
and
commonsense
and
dolly
own
good
name
i
began
to
perceive
that
matters
were
not
so
simple
i
do
not
think
i
reasoned
at
all
as
to
her
dangers
there
but
i
was
as
one
who
sees
a
flower
on
a
dunghill
one
does
not
argue
about
the
matter
or
question
whether
it
be
smirched
or
not
nor
how
it
got
there
neither
did
i
consider
at
all
how
my
cousin
came
to
be
at
court
nor
whether
any
evil
had
yet
come
to
her
i
did
not
even
consider
that
i
did
not
know
whether
she
were
but
just
come
or
had
been
there
a
great
while
i
considered
only
that
she
must
be
got
out
of
it
and
how
to
set
about
it
i
might
have
stood
and
paced
there
till
midnight
had
not
one
of
the
sentinels
at
the
placed
there
i
suppose
as
chiffinch
had
told
me
just
now
as
an
additional
security
after
nightfall
stepped
out
from
his
place
and
challenged
me
i
had
had
the
word
of
course
as
i
came
in
and
i
gave
it
him
and
he
was
contented
but
i
was
not
here
thought
i
is
my
opportunity
here
said
i
can
you
tell
me
where
mistress
dorothy
jermyn
is
lodged
he
was
a
young
fellow
plainly
from
the
country
as
i
saw
by
his
look
in
the
light
of
the
lantern
he
had
no
sir
he
said
think
again
i
said
she
is
under
the
protection
of
her
grace
of
portsmouth
she
is
one
of
the
queen
ladies
is
she
a
little
lady
sir
from
the
country
that
came
last
month
yes
i
said
feigning
that
i
knew
all
about
it
and
trying
to
control
my
voice
that
is
she
why
she
is
with
the
others
sir
he
said
she
is
not
with
the
duchess
then
no
sir
i
know
she
is
not
there
is
no
lady
with
the
duchess
beside
her
own
i
was
on
my
duty
there
last
week
this
was
something
of
a
relief
at
least
she
was
not
with
that
woman
now
i
knew
where
the
queen
maids
lodged
it
was
not
an
hundred
yards
away
divided
by
a
little
from
her
majesty
apartment
and
adjoining
the
king
with
a
wall
between
there
were
five
of
these
besides
those
who
lodged
with
their
families
but
they
changed
so
continually
that
i
could
not
be
sure
whether
i
knew
any
of
them
or
not
i
had
had
a
word
or
two
once
with
mademoiselle
de
la
garde
but
she
was
the
only
one
i
had
ever
spoken
with
and
besides
she
might
no
longer
be
there
and
she
was
a
great
busybody
too
and
beyond
her
i
knew
only
that
there
was
an
old
lady
whose
name
i
had
forgot
that
was
called
governess
to
them
all
and
played
the
part
of
duenna
except
when
she
could
be
bribed
by
green
oysters
and
spanish
wine
not
to
play
it
such
fragments
of
gossip
as
that
was
all
that
i
could
remember
as
well
as
certain
other
gossip
too
as
to
the
life
of
these
ladies
which
i
strove
to
forget
however
i
could
do
nothing
at
that
instant
but
bid
the
man
and
go
up
into
the
palace
again
with
a
brisk
assured
air
as
if
i
knew
what
i
was
about
a
bell
beat
eight
from
the
as
i
went
then
when
i
had
turned
the
corner
to
the
left
i
stopped
again
to
reckon
up
what
i
knew
this
did
not
come
to
very
much
her
majesty
i
knew
was
attended
always
by
two
maids
of
honour
at
the
least
and
at
this
hour
would
be
very
likely
at
cards
with
them
if
there
were
no
reception
or
entertainment
if
there
were
then
all
would
be
there
and
dolly
with
them
and
even
in
that
humour
i
did
not
think
of
forcing
my
way
into
her
presence
and
demanding
my
cousin
these
receptions
or
parties
or
some
such
thing
were
at
least
twice
or
three
times
a
week
if
her
majesty
were
well
the
reasonable
thing
to
do
i
confess
was
to
go
home
to
covent
garden
quietly
and
come
again
the
next
day
and
find
out
a
little
but
there
was
very
little
reason
in
me
i
was
set
but
upon
one
thing
and
that
was
to
see
dolly
that
night
with
my
own
eyes
and
assure
myself
that
matters
were
so
far
well
with
her
at
the
last
i
set
out
bravely
my
legs
carrying
me
along
as
it
appears
to
me
now
of
their
own
accord
for
i
can
not
say
that
i
had
formed
any
design
at
all
of
what
i
should
do
and
there
i
found
myself
after
a
minute
or
two
of
walking
in
the
rain
at
the
door
of
the
lodgings
where
all
the
ladies
that
had
not
their
families
at
court
lived
together
there
were
three
steps
up
to
the
heavy
oaken
door
that
was
studded
over
with
nails
and
in
the
little
window
by
the
door
a
light
was
burning
i
had
come
by
the
sentinel
that
stood
before
the
way
up
to
the
lodgings
and
had
given
him
the
word
but
i
saw
that
he
was
watching
me
and
that
i
must
shew
no
hesitation
i
went
therefore
up
the
steps
as
bold
as
a
lion
and
knocked
upon
the
oaken
door
i
waited
a
full
minute
but
there
was
no
answer
so
i
knocked
again
louder
and
presently
heard
movements
within
and
the
sound
of
the
bolts
being
drawn
then
the
door
opened
but
only
a
little
and
i
saw
an
old
woman
face
looking
at
me
she
said
something
but
i
could
not
hear
what
it
was
is
mistress
jermyn
within
doors
i
asked
the
old
face
mumbled
at
me
but
i
could
not
hear
a
word
is
mistress
jermyn
within
i
asked
again
once
again
the
face
mumbled
at
me
and
then
the
door
began
to
close
this
would
never
do
so
i
set
my
foot
against
it
suddenly
all
overcome
with
impatience
for
i
was
in
no
mood
to
chop
words
and
with
the
same
kind
of
fury
that
had
seized
me
in
chiffinch
rooms
i
saw
red
as
the
saying
is
and
it
was
not
likely
that
a
deaf
old
woman
would
stop
me
she
fluttered
the
door
passionately
and
then
as
i
pushed
on
it
she
cried
out
there
was
a
great
rattle
of
footsteps
and
as
i
came
into
the
little
paved
entrance
a
heavy
bald
fellow
ran
out
of
the
room
where
i
had
seen
the
light
which
was
the
porter
parlour
in
his
very
angry
and
he
looked
at
me
like
a
bull
with
lowered
head
and
i
saw
that
he
carried
some
weapon
in
his
hand
is
mistress
jermyn
within
doors
i
asked
putting
on
a
high
kind
of
air
who
the
devil
are
you
said
he
i
was
not
going
to
argue
that
point
for
it
was
the
weakest
spot
in
my
assault
so
i
sat
down
on
the
stairs
that
rose
straight
up
to
the
first
floor
it
was
a
little
entrance
that
i
was
in
with
a
single
lamp
burning
in
a
socket
on
the
wall
you
will
first
answer
my
question
i
said
is
mistress
jermyn
within
doors
then
he
came
at
me
thinking
i
suppose
that
my
sitting
down
gave
him
an
advantage
and
he
lifted
his
weapon
as
he
came
i
had
no
time
to
draw
my
own
sword
which
was
besides
somewhere
between
my
legs
but
i
rose
up
and
as
i
rose
struck
out
at
his
chin
with
all
my
force
with
my
whole
weight
behind
he
staggered
back
against
the
doorway
he
had
come
out
by
and
the
same
moment
two
things
happened
the
old
woman
screamed
aloud
and
dolly
sprang
suddenly
out
on
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
from
a
door
that
opened
there
full
into
the
light
of
the
lamp
cried
she
oh
there
you
are
i
said
bitterly
then
mistress
jermyn
is
within
doors
then
i
turned
and
went
straight
upstairs
after
her
and
as
i
went
heard
the
ring
of
running
footsteps
in
the
paved
passage
out
of
doors
and
knew
that
the
guard
was
coming
up
the
fellow
still
leaned
dazed
against
the
doorpost
and
the
old
woman
was
pouring
out
scream
after
scream
i
went
after
dolly
straight
into
the
room
from
which
she
had
come
it
was
a
little
parlour
very
richly
furnished
with
candles
burning
and
curtains
across
the
windows
it
looked
out
towards
the
river
i
suppose
dolly
was
standing
as
pale
as
paper
but
i
could
not
tell
nor
did
i
greatly
care
whether
it
were
anger
or
terror
i
think
i
must
have
looked
pretty
frightening
but
then
she
had
spirit
enough
for
anything
for
i
was
still
in
my
splashed
boots
and
disordered
dress
and
as
angry
as
i
have
ever
been
in
my
life
i
could
see
she
was
not
dressed
for
her
majesty
so
i
supposed
and
i
proved
to
be
right
that
she
was
not
in
attendance
this
evening
it
was
better
fortune
than
i
deserved
to
find
her
so
now
said
i
what
are
you
doing
here
i
spoke
sharply
and
fiercely
as
to
a
bad
child
i
was
far
too
angry
to
do
otherwise
as
i
spoke
i
heard
the
guard
come
in
below
and
a
clamour
of
voices
break
out
i
knew
that
they
would
be
up
directly
now
i
said
again
you
have
your
choice
will
you
give
me
up
to
the
guard
or
will
you
hear
what
i
have
to
say
you
can
send
them
away
if
you
will
you
can
say
i
am
your
cousin
she
looked
at
me
but
said
nothing
oh
i
am
not
drunk
i
said
now
you
can
then
came
a
thunder
of
footsteps
on
the
stairs
and
i
stopped
i
knew
i
had
broken
every
law
of
the
court
i
had
behaved
unpardonably
it
would
mean
the
end
of
everything
for
me
but
i
would
not
even
now
have
asked
pardon
from
god
almighty
for
what
i
had
done
then
dolly
with
a
gesture
waved
me
aside
and
confronted
the
serjeant
on
the
threshold
you
can
go
she
said
this
is
my
cousin
i
will
arrange
with
them
below
the
man
hesitated
over
his
shoulder
i
could
see
a
couple
more
faces
glaring
in
at
me
dolly
stamped
her
foot
i
tell
you
to
go
do
you
not
hear
me
mistress
began
the
man
how
dare
you
disobey
me
cried
dolly
all
aflame
with
some
emotion
this
is
my
own
parlour
is
it
not
he
still
looked
doubtfully
and
his
eyes
wandered
from
her
to
me
and
back
again
he
was
yet
just
without
the
room
then
dolly
slammed
to
the
door
in
a
passion
in
his
very
face
then
she
wheeled
on
me
like
lightning
i
heard
the
men
footsteps
begin
to
go
downstairs
now
you
will
explain
if
you
please
she
began
with
a
furious
kind
of
bitterness
my
maid
said
i
that
kind
of
talk
will
not
do
with
me
for
at
her
tone
my
anger
blazed
up
higher
even
than
hers
it
is
i
who
have
to
ask
why
and
how
how
dare
you
she
began
i
went
up
without
more
ado
and
took
her
by
the
shoulders
never
in
all
the
time
i
had
known
her
had
the
thought
ever
come
to
me
that
one
day
i
might
treat
her
so
she
struggled
violently
and
seemed
on
the
point
of
crying
out
then
she
bit
her
lip
but
there
was
no
yielding
in
me
and
i
compelled
her
backwards
to
a
chair
you
will
sit
there
i
said
and
i
shall
stand
i
will
have
no
nonsense
at
all
she
looked
at
me
i
thought
with
more
hate
than
i
had
ever
seen
in
human
eyes
glaring
up
at
me
with
scorn
and
anger
and
resentment
all
mingled
yes
you
can
bully
maids
finely
she
said
you
can
come
and
cringe
for
their
protection
first
i
laughed
very
short
and
harsh
that
manner
is
of
no
good
at
all
i
said
you
will
answer
my
questions
how
did
you
come
here
how
long
have
you
been
here
she
said
nothing
but
continued
to
look
at
me
then
again
my
anger
rose
like
a
wave
do
you
think
to
stare
me
down
i
said
if
you
will
not
answer
me
i
begone
to
those
who
will
you
dare
not
dare
not
do
you
think
to
frighten
me
dolly
my
dear
i
am
not
in
the
mood
to
argue
will
you
tell
me
how
you
came
here
and
how
long
ago
i
must
have
an
answer
before
i
go
for
an
instant
she
was
silent
will
you
go
straight
home
again
if
i
tell
you
yes
i
will
promise
that
said
i
for
now
that
i
had
seen
her
with
my
own
eyes
most
of
what
i
desired
was
done
the
rest
could
wait
twelve
hours
well
then
she
said
i
have
been
here
a
month
and
my
father
put
me
here
your
father
yes
my
father
have
you
anything
to
say
against
him
no
i
will
say
it
to
him
i
wheeled
about
to
go
to
the
door
you
have
done
enough
mischief
then
you
think
sneered
dolly
i
turned
about
again
mischief
why
you
have
ruined
my
name
said
dolly
with
the
savage
look
in
her
eyes
still
there
but
you
did
not
think
of
that
you
thought
only
of
yourself
the
whole
palace
will
know
that
you
beat
down
the
porter
to
force
your
way
in
and
it
will
not
lose
in
the
telling
i
had
nothing
to
say
to
that
it
was
true
enough
and
the
very
kind
of
talk
with
which
the
court
continually
diverted
itself
but
i
would
not
show
my
dismay
indeed
the
very
thought
of
any
trouble
to
her
had
no
more
occurred
to
my
mind
than
the
consequences
to
a
charging
bull
we
will
see
about
that
i
said
when
i
speak
with
his
majesty
dolly
laughed
again
but
without
merriment
oh
you
will
do
this
and
that
no
doubt
she
said
and
when
shall
you
see
his
majesty
i
took
out
my
watch
it
is
nearly
nine
i
said
i
shall
see
his
majesty
in
thirteen
hours
you
had
best
be
packing
your
valises
we
shall
ride
at
noon
i
waited
no
more
to
hear
her
laugh
as
she
did
again
but
went
out
and
down
the
staircase
the
porter
chamber
had
its
door
half
open
i
pushed
the
door
and
went
in
the
fellow
started
up
here
is
a
guinea
said
i
throwing
one
upon
the
table
and
my
apologies
but
was
you
that
began
it
then
i
turned
and
went
out
as
i
came
down
the
steps
into
the
little
lamplit
way
a
man
was
coming
swiftly
up
it
from
the
direction
of
the
court
with
one
of
the
guards
behind
him
i
stopped
short
thinking
i
was
to
be
arrested
but
it
was
the
page
good
god
he
said
you
have
done
finely
indeed
i
was
still
all
shaking
and
i
simulated
anger
without
any
difficulty
and
whose
fault
is
that
said
i
as
if
in
a
fury
do
you
think
and
his
majesty
may
come
by
at
any
instant
he
said
why
that
is
what
i
wish
in
any
case
i
must
see
him
at
ten
you
are
mad
he
said
you
had
best
begone
to
the
country
before
dawn
and
even
that
will
not
save
you
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
the
young
man
who
had
fetched
him
and
who
now
stood
waiting
save
me
what
have
i
done
i
have
but
been
to
visit
my
cousin
i
said
this
very
loud
that
the
guard
might
hear
again
chiffinch
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
back
again
i
could
see
the
shine
of
lanterns
where
others
waited
behind
we
were
just
outside
the
king
lodging
well
sir
he
said
but
you
will
go
now
will
you
not
why
yes
i
said
and
i
will
be
with
you
at
nine
he
beckoned
the
young
soldier
up
see
this
gentleman
to
the
gate
he
said
he
will
find
his
way
home
after
that
chapter
iii
i
spent
a
very
heavy
evening
before
i
went
to
bed
and
when
i
was
there
i
could
not
sleep
for
it
appeared
to
me
that
i
had
made
a
great
fool
of
myself
having
injured
my
own
prospects
and
done
no
good
to
anyone
i
understood
perfectly
that
i
had
acted
in
an
unpardonable
manner
for
her
majesty
maids
of
honour
were
kept
or
were
supposed
to
be
kept
in
very
great
seclusion
at
home
as
if
they
were
vestal
virgins
which
was
indeed
a
very
great
supposition
tale
after
tale
came
back
to
my
mind
of
those
maids
in
the
past
of
mademoiselle
de
la
garde
herself
of
miss
stewart
miss
hyde
miss
hamilton
and
others
like
them
some
of
whom
were
indeed
good
but
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
remaining
so
for
the
court
of
charles
was
a
terrible
place
for
virtue
it
was
astonishing
to
me
that
the
horror
of
the
place
had
not
before
this
affected
me
but
it
is
always
so
we
are
very
philosophical
always
over
the
wrongs
that
do
not
touch
ourselves
as
to
how
my
cousin
dolly
came
to
be
in
such
a
place
i
began
to
think
that
i
understood
it
must
all
have
dated
from
that
unhappy
visit
of
the
duke
of
monmouth
to
hare
street
my
cousin
tom
must
have
followed
up
that
strange
introduction
and
the
affair
must
have
been
worked
through
her
grace
of
portsmouth
i
think
i
could
have
taken
my
cousin
tom
by
the
throat
and
choked
him
as
i
thought
of
this
meantime
i
had
no
idea
as
to
what
i
should
do
the
next
day
except
indeed
see
his
majesty
and
say
perhaps
one
tenth
of
what
i
felt
i
had
told
dolly
we
should
ride
at
noon
next
day
i
was
beginning
to
wonder
whether
this
prediction
would
be
fulfilled
yet
though
i
had
begun
to
consider
myself
more
than
in
the
first
flush
i
still
felt
my
anger
rise
in
me
like
a
tide
whenever
i
regarded
the
bare
facts
but
mere
anger
would
never
do
and
i
set
myself
to
drive
it
down
besides
it
would
be
there
i
knew
and
ready
if
i
should
need
it
on
the
next
day
when
i
arrived
at
chiffinch
the
next
morning
i
found
him
in
a
very
grave
mood
he
did
not
rise
as
i
came
in
but
nodded
to
me
only
sit
down
mallock
said
he
this
is
a
very
serious
affair
so
i
think
i
said
he
waved
that
away
his
majesty
hath
heard
every
word
of
it
with
embellishments
he
is
very
angry
indeed
nothing
but
what
you
have
done
for
him
lately
could
have
saved
you
and
even
now
i
do
not
know
man
i
said
do
not
let
us
leave
such
talk
as
this
it
is
not
i
who
am
in
question
i
think
you
will
find
that
it
is
he
answered
me
with
a
quick
look
i
strove
to
be
patient
and
even
more
to
appear
so
well
i
said
what
have
i
done
i
am
come
back
from
france
i
hear
my
cousin
is
here
i
go
to
see
her
a
fellow
at
the
door
is
impertinent
and
i
chastise
him
for
it
then
i
go
upstairs
to
my
cousin
parlour
that
is
the
point
he
interrupted
it
is
not
your
cousin
it
is
the
lodging
of
the
maids
of
honour
yes
he
had
me
there
that
was
my
weak
point
but
i
would
not
let
him
see
that
how
was
i
to
understand
that
distinction
i
knocked
at
the
door
as
peaceably
as
any
man
could
and
after
that
he
said
smiling
a
little
grimly
after
that
your
cousinly
affection
blinded
you
well
that
will
do
i
said
he
smiled
again
well
that
is
your
case
he
observed
we
will
see
how
his
majesty
regards
it
for
i
must
tell
you
mallock
that
for
five
minutes
last
night
it
was
touch
and
go
whether
you
were
not
to
be
arrested
and
i
will
tell
you
this
too
that
if
you
had
not
come
this
morning
you
would
have
been
brought
as
bad
as
that
i
said
laughing
but
i
must
confess
that
his
gravity
dismayed
me
a
little
as
bad
as
that
he
said
you
must
go
to
his
majesty
at
ten
as
i
arranged
i
said
as
his
majesty
arranged
said
chiffinch
rising
and
it
is
close
upon
the
time
and
then
he
added
with
the
utmost
gravity
if
there
is
one
thing
his
sacred
majesty
is
touchy
upon
it
is
the
reputation
of
the
ladies
of
the
court
i
would
remember
that
sir
if
i
were
you
i
observed
a
while
ago
that
pride
is
a
good
weapon
if
one
has
not
humility
so
is
anger
a
good
weapon
if
one
has
not
patience
and
i
do
not
mean
simulated
anger
but
the
passion
itself
held
in
a
leash
like
a
dog
and
loosed
when
the
time
comes
now
so
great
was
my
feeling
for
his
majesty
and
that
not
only
of
an
honest
loyalty
but
of
a
real
kind
of
respect
that
i
had
for
his
person
and
his
parts
a
real
fear
of
the
very
great
strength
of
will
that
lay
beneath
his
weakness
that
i
understood
that
unless
my
anger
was
fairly
near
the
surface
i
should
be
beaten
down
when
i
came
into
his
presence
so
as
we
went
together
towards
his
lodgings
i
looked
to
see
that
my
anger
was
there
patted
it
on
the
head
so
to
say
and
called
it
good
dog
and
was
relieved
to
hear
it
growl
softly
in
answer
plainly
we
were
expected
because
the
two
guards
at
the
door
stood
aside
as
soon
as
they
saw
us
and
one
of
them
called
out
something
to
a
man
above
there
were
two
more
at
the
door
itself
and
we
went
in
as
we
came
in
at
the
door
of
the
private
closet
having
had
no
answer
to
our
knock
his
majesty
came
in
at
the
other
with
two
dogs
at
his
heels
he
paid
no
attention
to
me
at
all
and
barely
nodded
at
my
companion
then
he
sat
down
to
his
table
and
began
to
write
leaving
us
standing
there
like
a
pair
of
schoolboys
again
i
stroked
the
head
of
my
anger
i
could
see
the
king
was
very
seriously
displeased
and
that
unless
i
could
keep
myself
determined
he
would
have
the
best
of
the
interview
and
that
i
was
resolved
he
should
not
have
suddenly
he
spoke
still
writing
you
can
go
chiffinch
said
he
come
back
in
half
an
hour
he
looked
up
for
a
flash
and
nodded
and
i
thought
god
knows
why
that
he
had
in
mind
the
guards
outside
and
that
they
should
be
within
call
i
knew
precisely
what
my
legal
offence
would
be
that
of
brawling
within
the
precincts
of
the
palace
and
the
penalties
of
this
i
did
not
care
to
think
about
for
i
was
not
sure
enough
what
they
were
when
the
door
closed
behind
chiffinch
i
felt
more
alone
than
ever
i
regarded
the
king
dark
face
turned
down
upon
his
paper
his
dusky
ringed
hand
with
the
lace
turned
back
the
quill
that
he
used
his
great
plumed
hat
i
looked
now
and
again
discreetly
round
the
room
at
the
gorgeous
carvings
the
tall
presses
the
innumerable
clocks
the
brightly
polished
windows
with
the
river
flowing
beneath
i
felt
very
little
and
lonely
then
in
a
flash
the
memory
came
back
that
not
fifty
yards
away
was
dolly
little
parlour
and
dolly
herself
and
my
determination
surged
up
once
more
suddenly
his
majesty
threw
down
his
pen
mallock
he
said
very
sternly
there
is
only
one
excuse
for
you
that
you
were
drunk
last
night
do
you
plead
that
he
was
looking
straight
at
me
with
savage
melancholy
eyes
i
dropped
my
own
no
sir
you
dare
to
say
you
were
not
drunk
yes
sir
his
majesty
caught
up
an
ivory
knife
and
sat
drawing
it
through
his
fingers
still
looking
at
me
i
perceived
though
i
kept
my
eyes
down
i
could
see
that
he
was
violently
impatient
mallock
said
he
this
is
intolerable
you
come
back
from
france
where
you
have
done
me
good
service
i
will
never
deny
that
and
you
win
my
gratitude
and
then
you
fling
it
all
away
by
a
piece
of
unpardonable
behaviour
are
you
aware
of
the
penalties
for
such
behaviour
as
yours
brawling
in
the
palace
itself
knocking
my
men
down
forcing
your
way
into
the
lodgings
of
her
majesty
ladies
have
you
anything
to
say
as
to
why
you
should
not
go
before
the
green
cloth
a
great
surge
of
contradiction
and
defiance
rose
within
me
but
i
choked
it
down
again
it
was
there
if
i
should
need
it
the
effort
held
me
steady
and
balanced
do
you
hear
me
sir
yes
sir
said
i
well
what
have
you
to
say
he
glanced
past
me
towards
the
door
and
i
thought
again
that
the
guards
were
in
his
mind
sir
i
have
a
very
great
deal
to
say
but
i
fear
i
should
offend
your
majesty
the
king
jerked
his
head
impatiently
it
is
of
the
nature
of
a
defence
certainly
sir
say
it
then
you
need
one
i
raised
my
eyes
and
looked
him
in
the
face
he
was
frowning
and
his
lips
were
moving
evidently
he
was
very
angry
and
yet
he
was
perplexed
too
sir
this
is
precisely
what
took
place
i
returned
from
france
last
night
where
as
your
majesty
was
good
enough
to
remark
i
was
able
to
be
of
some
little
service
upon
my
return
i
heard
from
chiffinch
that
my
cousin
as
he
was
kind
enough
to
call
her
was
in
whitehall
as
one
of
her
majesty
ladies
i
went
to
see
my
cousin
perhaps
a
little
precipitately
but
i
went
peaceably
first
inquiring
of
one
of
your
majesty
guards
where
her
lodgings
were
i
knocked
peaceably
upon
the
door
an
old
woman
opened
to
me
and
would
give
me
no
intelligible
answer
to
my
peaceable
inquiry
as
to
whether
my
cousin
were
there
i
prevented
her
closing
the
door
in
my
face
but
peaceably
then
a
fellow
ran
out
and
asked
me
who
the
devil
i
was
again
peaceably
i
inquired
for
my
cousin
i
even
sat
down
upon
the
stairs
then
he
made
at
me
and
in
i
struck
him
once
with
my
hand
my
cousin
looked
out
of
a
door
and
i
went
up
into
what
i
understood
was
her
parlour
when
the
guard
came
she
sent
them
away
telling
them
i
was
her
cousin
the
serjeant
was
impertinent
to
her
and
she
shut
the
door
in
his
face
i
remained
five
minutes
or
six
with
my
cousin
and
then
went
peaceably
away
and
to
my
lodgings
that
is
the
entire
truth
sir
from
beginning
to
end
the
king
laughed
very
short
and
harsh
you
put
it
admirably
he
said
you
are
a
diplomat
indeed
that
is
my
defence
to
your
majesty
and
it
is
perfectly
true
neither
less
nor
more
than
the
truth
but
i
am
not
only
a
diplomat
he
did
not
fully
understand
me
i
think
for
he
looked
at
me
sharply
well
he
said
what
else
i
have
another
defence
for
the
public
sir
not
so
courteous
to
your
majesty
he
remained
rigid
an
instant
then
for
the
public
he
said
you
do
not
think
the
truth
enough
no
sir
it
is
for
your
majesty
that
i
think
the
truth
too
much
i
will
have
it
cried
the
king
this
moment
interiorly
i
licked
my
lips
as
a
dog
when
he
sees
a
bone
his
majesty
should
have
the
truth
now
with
a
vengeance
all
was
falling
out
exactly
as
i
had
designed
he
should
not
have
kept
me
waiting
so
long
or
i
might
not
have
thought
of
it
well
sir
said
i
you
will
remember
i
should
not
have
dared
to
say
it
to
your
majesty
had
i
not
been
commanded
he
said
nothing
then
once
more
i
ruffled
my
growling
dog
ears
so
that
he
snarled
first
sir
to
the
public
i
should
say
if
this
is
counted
brawling
what
of
other
scenes
in
whitehall
on
which
no
charge
was
made
what
of
the
smashed
all
to
fragments
one
night
in
the
privy
garden
by
certain
of
the
king
gentlemen
whom
i
could
name
what
of
the
broken
not
only
in
the
city
but
upon
certain
doors
in
whitehall
itself
broken
again
by
certain
of
the
king
gentlemen
whom
i
could
name
what
of
a
scene
i
viewed
myself
in
the
banqueting
hall
last
christmastide
in
your
majesty
presence
when
a
spanish
gentleman
received
full
in
his
face
a
bunch
of
raisins
from
ah
snarled
the
king
and
you
would
say
that
to
the
public
sir
that
is
only
the
exordium
my
voice
was
raised
a
little
i
think
for
indeed
i
was
raging
again
by
now
next
i
would
observe
that
mistress
jermyn
is
my
own
cousin
and
that
the
hour
was
eight
in
the
evening
not
nine
if
i
may
so
far
correct
your
majesty
whereas
very
different
hours
are
kept
by
some
members
of
the
court
and
the
ladies
are
not
their
cousins
at
all
i
had
never
seen
the
king
so
angry
he
was
unable
to
speak
for
fury
his
face
paled
to
under
his
sallow
skin
and
his
eyes
burned
like
coals
this
time
i
lashed
my
anger
deliberately
instead
of
tickling
it
merely
sir
that
is
not
nearly
all
but
i
will
miss
out
a
few
points
and
come
to
my
peroration
my
peroration
would
be
after
this
fashion
such
i
would
say
is
the
charge
against
one
who
has
been
of
service
to
his
majesty
and
such
is
the
court
as
i
have
described
of
that
same
king
there
is
not
a
court
in
europe
that
has
a
prince
so
noble
as
our
own
can
be
of
better
parts
or
of
higher
ambitions
or
of
so
pure
a
blood
and
there
is
no
prince
who
is
served
so
poorly
no
court
that
so
stinks
in
the
nostrils
of
god
and
man
as
does
his
he
is
capable
i
cried
for
by
now
i
was
lost
to
all
consideration
for
myself
my
loyalty
and
love
for
him
had
come
to
the
aid
of
my
anger
and
i
saw
that
never
again
should
i
have
such
an
opportunity
of
speaking
my
mind
he
is
capable
of
as
great
achievements
as
any
prince
that
has
gone
before
him
for
he
has
already
won
back
the
throne
which
his
fathers
lost
would
it
be
of
service
i
would
say
to
such
a
prince
as
this
to
punish
a
man
who
would
lay
down
his
life
for
him
to
give
him
even
a
moment
pleasure
and
to
let
go
men
and
women
who
have
never
done
anything
but
injure
him
i
ceased
breathless
yet
triumphing
for
i
knew
that
i
had
held
his
majesty
with
my
words
how
he
would
take
it
when
he
recovered
i
did
not
know
nor
did
i
greatly
care
i
had
spoken
my
mind
to
him
at
last
and
what
i
had
said
was
no
more
than
my
conviction
that
blessed
gift
of
anger
had
done
the
rest
and
having
done
its
work
retired
again
to
chaos
and
left
me
and
master
of
myself
when
i
looked
at
him
he
was
motionless
he
was
still
very
pale
but
the
terrible
brightness
of
his
eyes
was
gone
then
he
roused
himself
to
sneer
but
i
did
not
care
for
that
for
there
was
no
other
way
for
him
just
then
consonant
with
his
own
dignity
very
admirably
preached
said
he
even
if
a
trifle
treasonous
i
am
pleased
your
majesty
is
satisfied
i
said
with
a
little
bow
then
he
broke
down
altogether
in
the
only
way
that
he
could
he
gave
a
great
spirt
of
laughter
then
he
leaned
back
and
laughed
till
the
tears
ran
down
presently
he
was
quieter
oddsfish
he
cried
this
is
a
turning
of
tables
indeed
i
sent
for
you
mallock
the
door
opened
softly
behind
me
and
a
man
put
his
head
in
go
away
go
away
cried
the
king
can
not
you
see
i
am
being
preached
to
the
door
closed
again
i
sent
for
you
mallock
to
reprimand
you
very
severely
and
instead
of
that
it
is
you
who
have
held
the
whip
little
ken
is
nothing
to
it
you
should
have
been
a
bishop
mr
mallock
again
he
spirted
with
laughter
then
he
drew
himself
up
in
his
chair
a
little
and
became
more
grave
this
is
all
very
well
he
said
but
i
think
i
must
get
in
my
reprimand
for
all
that
you
will
not
be
sent
to
the
or
the
green
cloth
or
whatever
it
is
that
would
meet
your
case
this
time
mallock
i
will
deal
with
you
myself
but
it
is
a
very
serious
business
and
your
distinctions
would
not
serve
you
in
law
a
sundial
is
not
so
important
as
a
christian
lady
and
a
bunch
of
raisins
is
not
legally
a
blow
in
the
face
still
less
are
all
the
sundials
and
spaniards
in
the
world
equal
to
one
of
her
majesty
maids
of
honour
you
understand
that
i
bowed
again
reminding
myself
that
i
was
not
done
with
him
even
yet
yes
sir
consider
yourself
reprimanded
severely
mr
mallock
i
bowed
but
i
stood
still
you
have
my
leave
oh
by
the
way
mallock
there
are
just
ten
words
i
must
have
with
you
on
the
french
affairs
he
motioned
to
a
seat
i
may
kiss
the
hand
that
has
beaten
me
said
i
he
laughed
again
he
was
a
very
merry
prince
when
he
was
in
the
mood
it
should
be
the
other
way
about
i
should
think
he
said
but
he
gave
me
his
hand
and
i
sat
down
all
the
while
we
were
talking
still
with
of
my
mind
i
was
considering
what
was
to
be
done
next
it
was
a
part
only
of
my
business
that
had
been
done
yet
how
to
accomplish
the
rest
without
spoiling
all
presently
his
majesty
himself
repeated
that
which
chiffinch
had
already
said
to
me
and
spoke
of
some
kind
of
recognition
that
was
due
to
me
that
gave
me
my
cue
your
majesty
is
exceedingly
kind
i
said
but
i
trust
i
am
not
to
be
dismissed
from
the
king
service
chiffinch
appeared
to
think
why
no
said
he
not
even
after
all
your
crimes
besides
we
have
something
for
you
did
he
not
tell
you
any
public
recognition
sir
i
said
would
effectually
do
so
the
very
small
value
that
my
services
may
have
would
wholly
be
lost
if
they
were
known
in
any
way
chiffinch
said
the
same
observed
the
king
meditatively
but
sir
i
said
might
i
not
have
some
private
recognition
instead
there
is
a
very
particular
favour
i
have
in
mind
which
would
be
private
altogether
and
which
i
would
take
as
a
complete
discharge
of
that
which
your
majesty
has
been
good
enough
to
call
a
debt
of
the
king
not
money
man
surely
exclaimed
the
king
in
alarm
not
in
the
least
sir
it
will
not
cost
the
exchequer
a
farthing
well
you
shall
have
it
then
you
may
be
sure
of
that
well
sir
said
i
it
is
a
serious
matter
your
majesty
will
dislike
it
exceedingly
he
pursed
his
lips
and
looked
at
me
sharply
wait
he
said
it
will
not
affect
my
honour
or
or
my
religion
in
any
way
i
assumed
an
air
of
slight
offence
sir
i
should
not
be
likely
to
ask
it
if
it
affected
your
honour
and
as
for
religion
i
stopped
for
one
more
opening
presented
itself
which
i
dared
not
neglect
from
both
his
manner
and
his
words
i
saw
that
religion
was
not
very
far
from
his
thoughts
well
sir
he
said
and
what
of
religion
sir
i
pray
every
day
for
your
majesty
conversion
conversion
eh
conversion
to
the
holy
catholic
church
sir
i
would
give
my
life
for
that
ten
times
over
there
there
have
done
said
his
majesty
with
a
touch
of
uneasiness
but
i
would
not
ask
a
pledge
blindfold
sir
even
to
save
all
those
ten
lives
of
mine
one
more
than
a
cat
eh
do
you
know
mallock
you
remind
me
sometimes
of
a
cat
you
are
so
demure
and
yet
you
can
pounce
and
scratch
when
the
occasion
comes
i
would
sooner
it
had
been
a
little
dog
sir
i
said
glancing
at
the
spaniels
that
were
curled
up
together
before
the
fire
well
well
we
are
wandering
smiled
the
king
now
what
is
this
favour
i
supposed
i
must
have
looked
very
grave
and
serious
for
before
i
could
speak
he
leaned
forward
it
is
to
count
as
a
complete
discharge
i
understood
you
to
say
mallock
for
all
obligations
on
my
part
and
there
is
no
money
in
it
yes
sir
said
i
and
there
is
no
money
in
it
he
must
have
seen
i
was
serious
well
i
take
you
at
your
word
sir
i
will
grant
it
tell
me
what
it
is
he
leaned
back
looking
at
me
curiously
sir
i
said
it
is
now
about
ten
what
i
ask
is
that
my
cousin
mistress
dorothy
jermyn
receives
an
immediate
dismissal
from
her
majesty
service
and
is
ordered
to
leave
london
with
me
for
her
father
house
at
noon
his
majesty
looked
at
me
amazed
i
think
he
did
not
know
whether
to
be
angry
or
to
laugh
well
sir
he
said
at
last
that
is
the
maddest
request
i
have
ever
had
you
mean
what
you
say
certainly
sir
well
you
must
have
it
then
it
is
the
queerest
kindness
i
have
ever
done
why
do
you
ask
it
eh
sir
you
do
not
want
my
peroration
over
again
his
face
darkened
that
is
very
like
impudence
mr
mallock
i
do
not
mean
it
for
such
sir
it
is
the
naked
truth
you
think
this
is
not
a
fitting
place
for
her
i
am
sure
it
is
not
sir
i
said
very
earnestly
nor
for
any
would
your
majesty
think
he
jerked
his
head
impatiently
what
my
majesty
thinks
is
one
thing
what
i
charles
stuart
do
is
another
well
you
must
have
it
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
i
think
he
expected
me
to
stand
up
and
take
my
leave
but
i
remained
still
in
my
chair
well
what
else
sir
he
asked
sir
it
is
near
a
quarter
to
eleven
i
have
not
the
order
yet
bah
well
am
i
to
write
it
then
if
your
majesty
will
condescend
and
what
shall
i
say
to
the
queen
it
is
not
very
courteous
to
dismiss
a
lady
of
hers
so
abruptly
sir
tell
her
majesty
it
is
a
debt
of
honour
he
wheeled
back
to
his
table
took
up
a
sheet
and
began
to
write
when
he
had
done
he
scattered
the
sand
on
it
and
held
it
out
to
me
his
mouth
twitching
a
little
will
that
serve
he
said
i
have
that
paper
still
it
is
written
with
five
lines
only
and
a
signature
it
runs
as
follows
this
is
to
command
mistress
dorothy
jermyn
late
maid
of
honour
to
her
majesty
now
dismissed
by
the
king
though
through
no
fault
of
her
own
to
leave
the
court
at
whitehall
at
noon
in
company
with
her
cousin
roger
mallock
and
never
to
return
thither
without
his
consent
charles
then
followed
the
date
i
had
a
criticism
or
two
but
i
dared
not
make
them
that
is
more
than
i
could
have
asked
sir
i
am
under
an
eternal
obligation
to
your
majesty
i
daresay
but
all
mine
are
discharged
to
you
until
you
earn
some
more
it
might
have
meant
a
peerage
mr
mallock
i
do
not
regret
it
sir
i
said
as
i
rose
after
kissing
his
hand
he
said
one
more
word
to
me
you
are
either
a
very
wise
man
or
a
fool
mallock
and
by
god
i
do
not
know
which
but
i
do
know
you
are
a
very
brave
one
i
was
a
very
angry
one
sir
said
i
but
you
are
appeased
a
thousand
times
sir
chapter
iv
i
knew
i
could
never
carry
the
matter
through
alone
so
upon
leaving
the
king
presence
i
sought
out
chiffinch
immediately
and
told
him
what
had
passed
he
whistled
loud
you
are
pretty
fortunate
he
said
many
a
man
i
have
no
time
for
compliments
said
i
you
must
come
with
me
to
my
cousin
at
once
we
must
ride
at
noon
and
it
is
close
upon
eleven
you
want
me
to
plead
for
you
eh
not
at
all
said
i
there
will
be
no
pleading
it
is
to
certify
only
that
this
is
the
king
writing
and
that
he
means
what
he
says
well
well
said
chiffinch
and
what
of
the
matter
i
spoke
to
you
of
last
night
have
you
decided
there
is
not
much
time
to
lose
you
must
give
me
a
day
or
two
i
said
it
was
he
who
knocked
this
time
and
it
was
not
until
the
old
woman
had
opened
and
was
curtseying
to
the
king
page
that
he
called
me
up
come
mallock
your
cousin
is
within
we
went
straight
upstairs
after
the
old
lady
and
upon
her
knock
being
answered
she
threw
the
door
open
my
cousin
dolly
was
sitting
over
her
needle
all
alone
she
looked
i
thought
unusually
pale
but
she
flushed
scarlet
and
sprang
up
so
soon
as
she
saw
me
mistress
jermyn
said
the
page
very
courteously
we
are
come
on
a
very
sad
errand
sad
that
is
to
those
whom
you
will
leave
behind
what
do
you
mean
sir
asked
dolly
very
fiercely
she
did
not
give
me
one
look
after
the
first
he
held
out
the
paper
to
her
she
took
it
with
fingers
that
shook
a
little
and
read
it
through
at
least
twice
is
this
an
insult
sir
or
a
very
poor
pleasantry
her
face
was
gone
pale
again
it
is
neither
mistress
it
is
a
very
sober
fact
this
is
the
king
hand
she
snapped
it
is
said
chiffinch
dolly
said
i
i
told
you
to
be
ready
by
noon
but
you
would
not
believe
me
i
suppose
your
packing
is
not
done
she
paid
me
no
more
attention
than
if
i
had
been
a
chair
chiffinch
said
she
you
tell
me
upon
your
honour
that
this
is
the
king
hand
and
that
he
means
what
is
written
here
i
give
you
my
honour
mistress
he
said
she
tossed
the
paper
upon
the
table
she
went
swiftly
across
to
the
further
door
and
opened
it
anne
she
said
a
voice
answered
her
from
within
put
out
my
pack
all
that
you
can
that
i
shall
need
in
the
country
we
have
to
ride
at
noon
she
shut
the
door
again
and
turned
on
us
or
rather
upon
chiffinch
sir
she
said
you
have
done
your
errand
perhaps
you
will
now
relieve
me
of
your
company
i
shall
be
awaiting
my
cousin
roger
mallock
as
the
king
requires
at
noon
dolly
said
i
she
continued
looking
through
me
as
through
glass
at
noon
and
i
trust
he
will
not
keep
me
waiting
there
was
no
more
to
be
done
we
turned
and
went
out
lord
what
a
termagant
is
your
pretty
cousin
mr
mallock
said
my
companion
when
we
were
out
of
doors
again
you
could
have
trusted
her
well
enough
i
think
i
was
not
in
the
mood
to
discuss
her
with
him
i
had
other
things
to
think
of
chiffinch
i
said
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
but
i
must
be
off
for
my
own
packing
and
i
bade
him
when
i
rode
into
the
court
five
minutes
before
noon
a
very
piteous
little
group
awaited
me
by
the
inner
gate
dolly
very
white
and
angry
stood
by
the
striving
to
preserve
her
dignity
her
maid
was
behind
her
arguing
how
the
bags
should
be
disposed
on
the
with
the
fellow
who
was
to
lead
it
dolly
own
horse
was
not
yet
come
but
as
i
rode
up
to
salute
her
he
came
out
of
an
archway
led
by
a
groom
i
leapt
off
and
stood
by
the
to
help
her
again
it
was
as
if
i
were
not
there
she
jerked
her
head
to
the
man
help
me
she
said
he
was
in
a
quandary
for
he
could
not
leave
the
horse
head
i
am
very
sorry
dolly
said
i
but
you
will
have
to
put
up
for
me
for
once
come
she
gave
a
look
of
despair
round
about
but
there
was
no
help
it
is
on
the
stroke
of
noon
i
said
she
submitted
but
it
was
with
the
worst
grace
i
have
ever
seen
she
accepted
my
ministrations
but
it
was
as
if
i
were
a
machine
not
one
word
did
she
speak
good
or
bad
by
the
time
that
she
was
mounted
her
maid
was
up
too
and
the
bags
disposed
come
i
said
again
and
mounted
my
own
horse
as
we
rode
out
through
the
great
gate
the
clock
tower
beat
the
hour
of
noon
i
am
weary
of
saying
that
my
journeys
were
strange
but
certainly
this
was
another
of
them
through
the
narrow
streets
i
made
no
attempt
to
ride
beside
her
in
the
van
went
three
of
my
men
then
rode
i
then
about
ten
yards
behind
came
dolly
and
her
maid
then
came
two
led
by
a
fellow
who
controlled
them
both
and
my
fourth
man
closed
the
dismal
cavalcade
so
we
went
through
the
streets
all
the
way
down
the
strand
and
into
the
city
wheeled
to
the
left
and
so
out
by
bishopsgate
it
was
a
clear
kind
of
day
without
rain
but
the
clouds
hung
low
and
i
thought
it
would
rain
before
nightfall
i
intended
to
do
the
whole
journey
in
a
day
so
as
to
be
at
hare
street
before
midnight
at
least
a
night
on
the
way
and
dolly
company
at
supper
all
alone
with
me
or
even
with
her
maid
appeared
to
me
too
formidable
to
face
when
we
were
out
in
the
country
i
reined
my
horse
in
i
saw
a
change
pass
over
dolly
face
then
it
became
like
stone
we
have
a
long
ride
for
one
day
said
i
she
made
no
answer
my
anger
rose
a
little
my
cousin
i
said
i
had
the
honour
to
speak
to
you
i
do
not
wish
to
have
the
dishonour
of
answering
you
said
dolly
it
was
a
weakness
on
her
part
to
answer
at
all
but
i
suppose
she
could
not
resist
the
repartee
a
very
neat
hit
i
said
must
all
our
conversation
run
upon
these
lines
she
made
no
answer
at
all
anne
i
said
rein
your
horse
back
ten
yards
anne
said
dolly
ride
precisely
where
you
are
very
good
said
i
i
have
no
objection
to
your
maid
hearing
what
i
have
to
say
i
thought
it
would
be
you
that
would
object
anne
said
dolly
did
you
pack
the
sarcenet
yes
mistress
then
tell
me
again
the
tale
that
you
were
i
broke
in
with
such
fury
that
even
dolly
ceased
my
cousin
i
said
i
have
a
louder
voice
than
either
of
you
and
i
shall
use
it
if
you
do
not
listen
so
that
the
whole
countryside
shall
hear
i
have
to
say
this
that
some
time
or
another
i
have
to
have
a
private
conversation
with
you
it
is
for
you
to
choose
the
time
and
place
if
you
give
me
no
opportunity
now
i
shall
make
it
myself
later
will
you
hear
what
i
have
to
say
now
there
was
a
very
short
silence
anne
said
dolly
now
that
we
can
hear
ourselves
speak
will
you
tell
me
again
the
tale
that
you
began
last
night
she
said
it
not
at
all
lightly
but
with
a
coldness
and
a
distilled
kind
of
anger
that
gave
me
no
choice
i
lifted
my
hat
a
little
shook
my
reins
and
once
more
took
up
my
position
ten
yards
ahead
there
was
a
low
murmur
of
voices
behind
and
then
silence
it
appeared
that
the
tale
was
not
to
be
told
after
all
we
dined
very
late
at
a
little
inn
called
the
between
edmonton
and
ware
i
remember
nothing
at
all
either
of
the
inn
or
the
host
or
the
food
nothing
but
the
name
of
the
inn
for
the
name
struck
me
with
a
dreary
kind
of
wit
as
reflective
of
the
which
we
were
at
we
three
dined
together
in
profound
silence
except
when
dolly
addressed
a
word
or
two
to
her
maid
as
for
me
she
took
the
food
which
i
carved
all
as
if
i
were
a
servant
without
even
such
a
as
a
man
gives
to
a
servant
we
took
the
road
again
about
three
and
even
then
the
day
was
beginning
to
draw
in
a
little
very
bleak
and
dismal
and
that
too
i
took
as
a
symbol
of
my
heart
within
and
of
my
circumstances
and
prospects
certainly
i
had
gained
my
desire
in
one
way
i
had
got
dolly
away
from
court
yet
that
was
the
single
point
i
had
to
congratulate
myself
upon
all
else
it
appeared
was
ruined
i
had
lost
all
the
advantage
or
very
nearly
all
that
i
had
ever
won
from
the
king
for
i
knew
that
although
he
had
been
merry
at
the
end
of
the
time
he
would
not
forget
how
i
had
worsted
him
and
as
for
dolly
i
supposed
she
would
never
speak
to
me
again
it
had
been
bad
enough
when
i
had
left
hare
street
nearly
a
twelvemonth
ago
my
return
to
it
now
was
a
hundred
times
worse
although
dolly
however
would
not
speak
to
me
i
was
entirely
determined
to
speak
to
dolly
i
proposed
to
rehearse
to
her
what
i
had
done
and
why
and
when
that
was
over
i
would
leave
it
in
her
hands
whether
i
remained
at
hare
street
a
day
or
two
or
left
again
next
morning
more
than
a
day
or
two
i
did
not
even
hope
for
i
had
insulted
her
it
seemed
beyond
forgiveness
yet
besides
my
miserableness
there
was
something
very
like
pleasure
as
well
though
of
a
grim
sort
i
had
spoken
my
mind
to
her
pretty
well
and
would
do
so
more
explicitly
and
i
was
to
speak
my
mind
very
well
indeed
to
her
father
there
was
a
real
satisfaction
to
me
in
that
prospect
then
once
more
i
would
shut
the
door
for
ever
on
hare
street
and
go
back
again
to
town
and
begin
all
over
again
at
the
beginning
and
try
to
retrieve
a
little
of
what
i
had
lost
such
then
were
my
thoughts
we
supped
at
ware
at
the
and
the
same
wretched
performance
was
gone
through
as
at
the
night
was
fallen
completely
and
we
had
candles
that
guttered
not
a
little
dolly
was
silent
however
this
time
even
to
her
maid
she
did
not
give
me
one
look
all
through
supper
when
i
came
out
afterwards
to
the
horses
the
yard
was
all
in
a
mist
i
could
see
no
more
than
a
spot
of
light
where
the
lamp
should
be
by
the
the
host
came
with
me
it
has
fallen
very
foggy
sir
he
said
would
it
not
be
best
to
stay
the
night
i
was
considering
the
point
before
answering
but
my
cousin
answered
for
me
from
behind
nonsense
said
she
i
know
every
step
of
the
way
where
are
the
horses
even
that
i
observed
she
said
to
the
host
and
not
to
me
the
lady
is
impatient
to
get
home
i
said
is
the
fog
likely
to
spread
far
it
may
be
from
here
to
cambridge
sir
he
said
at
this
time
of
the
year
where
are
the
horses
said
dolly
again
there
was
no
help
for
it
once
more
we
mounted
dolly
again
assisted
by
the
host
and
not
by
me
but
anne
was
gracious
enough
to
accept
my
ministrations
for
a
few
miles
all
went
well
but
the
roads
hereabouts
were
very
soft
and
boggy
it
was
next
to
impossible
sometimes
to
know
whether
we
were
right
or
not
and
after
a
while
one
of
my
men
waited
for
me
he
that
carried
the
lantern
to
guide
the
rest
of
us
the
first
i
saw
of
him
was
his
horse
ears
very
black
like
a
pair
of
horns
against
the
lighted
mist
sir
he
said
i
do
not
know
the
road
i
can
see
not
five
yards
light
or
no
light
i
called
out
to
james
james
said
i
do
you
know
where
we
are
no
sir
said
he
at
least
not
very
well
cousin
i
said
for
dolly
had
reined
up
her
horse
close
behind
not
knowing
i
suppose
that
i
was
so
near
cousin
i
am
sorry
to
trouble
you
but
unless
you
can
lead
us
give
me
the
lantern
she
said
sharply
to
my
man
she
took
it
from
him
and
pushed
forwards
i
wheeled
my
horse
after
her
and
followed
the
rest
fell
in
behind
somewhere
i
did
not
say
one
word
good
or
bad
for
a
certain
thought
had
come
to
me
of
what
might
happen
she
thought
i
suppose
that
anne
was
behind
her
so
impatient
was
my
cousin
dolly
that
certain
of
her
road
as
she
supposed
she
urged
her
horse
presently
into
a
kind
of
amble
i
urged
mine
to
the
same
and
so
for
perhaps
ten
minutes
we
rode
in
silence
i
could
hear
the
horses
behind
or
rather
the
sucking
noise
of
their
feet
fall
behind
a
little
and
then
a
little
more
the
men
were
talking
too
and
so
was
anne
to
them
for
she
liked
men
company
and
did
not
get
very
much
of
it
in
dolly
service
and
this
i
suppose
was
the
reason
why
they
did
not
notice
how
the
distance
grew
between
us
after
about
ten
minutes
i
heard
a
man
shout
but
the
fog
deadened
his
voice
so
that
it
sounded
a
great
way
off
and
dolly
i
suppose
thought
he
was
not
of
our
party
at
all
for
she
never
turned
her
head
and
besides
she
was
intent
on
hating
me
and
that
i
think
absorbed
her
more
than
she
knew
i
said
nothing
i
rode
on
in
silence
seeing
her
like
an
outline
only
in
the
dark
now
and
again
and
more
commonly
nothing
but
a
kind
of
lighted
mist
now
and
then
obscured
it
appeared
to
me
that
we
were
very
far
away
to
the
right
but
then
i
never
professed
to
know
the
way
and
it
was
no
business
of
mine
truly
the
very
courses
of
nature
fought
against
my
cousin
and
her
passionate
ways
presently
i
turned
at
a
sound
and
there
was
james
mare
at
my
heels
i
knew
her
even
in
the
dark
by
the
white
blaze
on
her
forehead
i
had
been
listening
for
the
voices
and
had
not
noticed
he
was
there
i
reined
up
instantly
and
as
he
came
level
i
plucked
his
sleeve
james
i
whispered
in
italian
lest
dolly
should
catch
even
a
phrase
of
what
i
said
not
a
word
go
back
and
find
the
others
leave
us
we
will
find
our
way
james
was
an
exceedingly
discreet
and
sensible
fellow
as
i
knew
he
reined
back
upon
the
instant
and
was
gone
in
the
black
mist
and
i
could
hear
his
horse
footsteps
passing
into
the
distance
what
he
thought
god
and
he
alone
knew
for
he
never
told
me
the
soft
sound
of
the
hoofs
was
scarcely
died
away
before
i
too
had
to
pull
in
suddenly
for
there
were
the
haunches
of
dolly
horse
before
the
very
nose
of
my
poor
grey
she
had
halted
and
was
listening
i
held
my
breath
anne
she
said
suddenly
anne
where
are
you
as
in
the
scripture
there
was
no
voice
nor
any
that
answered
there
was
no
sound
at
all
but
the
creaking
of
the
harness
and
the
soft
breathing
of
the
horses
for
we
had
been
coming
over
heavy
ground
the
world
was
as
if
buried
in
wool
anne
she
said
again
and
i
caught
a
note
of
fear
in
her
voice
cousin
said
i
softly
i
fear
anne
is
lost
and
so
are
the
rest
you
see
you
would
not
speak
to
me
and
it
was
none
of
my
business
who
is
that
said
she
sharply
but
she
knew
well
enough
i
resolved
to
spare
her
nothing
for
i
was
beginning
to
understand
her
a
little
better
it
is
cousin
roger
i
said
you
see
you
said
you
knew
the
road
and
so
then
she
lashed
her
horse
suddenly
and
i
heard
him
plunge
but
he
could
not
go
fast
from
the
heaviness
of
the
ground
and
he
was
very
weary
too
as
were
we
all
besides
she
forgot
that
she
carried
the
lantern
i
think
and
i
was
able
to
follow
her
easily
enough
as
the
light
moved
up
and
down
then
the
light
halted
once
more
and
i
saw
a
great
whiteness
beyond
it
which
i
could
not
at
first
understand
i
came
up
quietly
and
spoke
again
dolly
my
dear
we
had
best
have
a
little
truce
an
armed
truce
if
you
will
but
a
truce
you
can
be
angry
with
me
again
afterwards
you
coward
she
said
with
a
sob
in
her
voice
to
lead
me
away
like
this
my
dear
it
was
you
who
did
the
leading
do
me
bare
justice
i
have
followed
very
humbly
she
made
no
answer
cousin
be
reasonable
i
said
let
us
find
the
way
out
of
this
and
when
we
are
clear
you
can
say
what
you
will
or
say
nothing
once
more
she
took
me
at
my
word
and
preserved
her
deadly
silence
i
slipped
off
my
horse
she
was
within
an
arm
length
and
not
trusting
her
i
passed
my
arm
with
scarcely
a
noticeable
movement
through
her
bridle
it
was
well
that
i
did
so
for
an
instant
after
she
tore
at
the
bridle
not
knowing
i
had
hold
of
it
and
lashed
her
horse
again
thinking
to
escape
whilst
i
was
on
the
ground
i
was
very
near
knocked
down
by
the
horse
shoulder
but
i
slipped
up
my
hand
and
caught
him
close
to
the
bit
holding
my
own
with
my
other
hand
you
termagant
i
said
as
soon
as
i
had
them
both
quiet
for
i
was
very
angry
indeed
to
be
treated
so
after
all
my
gentleness
no
more
trust
for
me
it
would
serve
you
right
if
i
left
you
here
leave
me
she
wailed
leave
me
you
coward
i
set
my
teeth
i
shall
not
i
said
i
shall
punish
you
by
remaining
i
know
you
hate
my
company
well
you
will
submit
to
it
then
because
i
choose
so
now
then
let
us
see
then
she
burst
out
suddenly
into
a
passion
of
weeping
i
set
my
teeth
harder
than
ever
there
was
only
one
way
after
all
to
get
the
better
of
dolly
and
i
had
pitched
on
it
yes
it
is
very
well
to
cry
i
said
you
nearly
had
me
killed
just
now
well
you
will
have
to
listen
to
me
presently
whether
you
like
it
or
not
give
me
the
lantern
she
made
no
movement
she
had
fought
down
the
tears
a
little
but
i
could
hear
her
breath
still
sobbing
i
reached
up
and
took
the
lantern
from
her
right
hand
now
where
in
god
name
are
we
said
i
we
had
ridden
into
some
kind
of
blind
alley
i
presently
saw
and
that
was
why
dolly
horse
had
halted
even
that
i
had
not
owed
to
her
goodwill
for
we
had
ridden
i
saw
presently
lifting
the
lantern
up
and
down
into
a
great
chalk
pit
and
must
have
turned
off
along
the
track
that
led
to
it
from
one
of
those
sunken
ways
that
drovers
use
to
bring
their
flocks
up
to
the
high
road
that
we
were
to
the
right
of
the
high
road
i
was
certain
of
my
own
observation
if
we
could
get
back
into
the
sunken
way
and
turn
to
the
right
we
might
find
ourselves
on
familiar
ground
again
however
i
said
nothing
of
this
to
dolly
i
was
resolved
that
she
should
suffer
a
little
more
first
i
took
the
bridles
of
the
two
horses
more
securely
slipping
my
hand
with
the
lantern
through
the
bridle
of
my
own
turned
their
heads
round
and
walked
between
them
looking
very
closely
on
this
side
and
that
and
turning
my
lantern
every
way
after
twenty
yards
i
saw
that
i
was
right
the
bank
on
my
left
proved
to
be
no
bank
but
the
of
the
chalk
pit
only
by
which
the
sunken
way
passed
very
near
i
led
the
horses
round
to
the
right
and
there
were
we
in
the
very
situation
i
had
surmised
still
holding
dolly
bridle
i
mounted
my
own
horse
and
when
i
had
done
so
to
secure
myself
and
her
the
better
i
pulled
the
reins
suddenly
over
her
horse
head
and
brought
them
into
my
left
hand
that
is
safer
i
observed
now
we
can
pretend
to
be
friends
again
and
hold
that
conversation
of
which
i
spoke
after
we
left
london
there
was
no
answer
as
we
set
out
along
the
way
it
was
a
little
clearer
by
now
and
i
could
see
the
bank
on
my
right
i
glanced
at
her
and
in
the
light
of
the
lantern
i
could
see
that
she
was
sitting
very
upright
and
motionless
like
a
shadow
i
lowered
the
lantern
to
the
right
side
so
that
she
was
altogether
in
the
dark
and
the
bank
illuminated
i
felt
a
little
compassion
for
her
indeed
but
i
dared
not
shew
it
now
cousin
i
said
i
preached
to
his
majesty
yesterday
and
he
told
me
i
should
be
a
bishop
at
least
now
it
is
you
that
must
hear
a
sermon
again
she
said
nothing
i
had
rehearsed
pretty
well
by
now
all
that
i
meant
to
say
to
her
and
it
was
good
for
me
that
i
had
else
i
might
have
fallen
weak
again
when
i
saw
her
so
unhappy
as
it
was
i
kept
back
some
of
the
biting
sentences
i
had
prepared
my
address
was
somewhat
as
follows
we
jogged
forward
very
gingerly
as
i
spoke
cousin
i
began
you
have
treated
me
very
ill
the
first
of
your
offences
to
me
was
that
though
i
had
earned
i
think
the
right
to
call
myself
your
friend
neither
you
nor
your
father
gave
me
any
hint
whatever
of
your
going
to
court
i
know
very
well
why
you
did
not
and
i
shall
have
a
little
discourse
to
make
to
your
father
upon
the
matter
at
the
proper
time
but
for
all
that
i
had
a
right
to
be
told
if
you
were
to
go
i
might
at
least
have
got
you
better
protection
in
the
beginning
than
that
of
the
the
well
of
her
grace
of
portsmouth
now
all
that
was
the
cause
of
the
very
small
offence
that
i
committed
against
you
myself
that
of
forcing
my
way
into
your
lodgings
for
that
i
offer
my
apologies
not
for
the
fact
but
for
the
manner
of
it
and
even
that
apology
is
not
very
deep
i
shall
presently
tell
you
why
the
next
of
your
offences
to
me
was
that
open
defiance
which
you
shewed
and
some
of
the
words
you
addressed
to
me
both
then
and
afterwards
you
have
told
me
i
was
a
coward
several
times
under
various
phrases
and
twice
i
think
cousin
i
am
a
great
many
things
i
should
not
be
but
i
do
not
think
i
am
a
coward
at
least
i
have
never
been
a
coward
in
your
presence
again
you
have
told
me
that
i
was
very
good
at
bullying
for
that
i
thank
god
and
gladly
plead
guilty
if
a
maid
is
bent
on
her
own
destruction
if
nothing
else
will
serve
she
must
be
bullied
out
of
it
again
i
thank
god
that
i
was
there
to
do
it
i
looked
at
her
out
of
the
tail
of
my
eye
her
head
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
little
hung
down
but
she
said
nothing
at
all
the
third
offence
of
yours
is
the
intolerable
discourtesy
you
have
shewn
to
me
all
and
before
servants
too
i
put
myself
to
great
pains
to
get
you
out
of
that
stinking
hole
called
whitehall
i
risked
his
majesty
displeasure
for
the
same
purpose
i
have
been
at
your
disposal
ever
since
noon
and
you
have
treated
me
like
a
dog
you
will
continue
to
treat
me
so
no
doubt
until
we
get
to
hare
street
and
you
will
do
your
best
no
doubt
to
provoke
a
quarrel
between
your
father
and
myself
well
i
have
no
great
objection
to
that
but
i
have
not
deserved
that
you
should
behave
so
i
have
done
nothing
ever
since
i
have
known
you
but
try
to
serve
you
my
voice
rose
a
little
for
i
was
truly
moved
and
far
more
than
my
words
shewed
you
first
treated
me
like
a
friend
then
when
you
would
not
have
me
as
a
lover
i
went
away
and
i
stayed
away
then
when
you
would
not
have
me
as
a
lover
and
i
would
not
have
you
as
my
friend
i
became
i
think
i
may
fairly
say
your
defender
and
all
that
you
do
in
return
then
without
any
mistake
at
all
i
caught
the
sound
of
a
sob
and
all
my
pompous
eloquence
dropped
from
me
like
a
cloak
my
anger
was
long
since
gone
though
i
had
feigned
it
had
not
to
be
alone
with
her
there
enclosed
in
the
darkness
as
in
a
little
room
her
horse
and
mine
nodding
their
heads
together
and
myself
holding
her
bridle
all
this
and
the
silence
round
us
and
my
own
heart
very
near
bursting
broke
me
down
oh
dolly
i
cried
why
are
you
so
bitter
with
me
you
know
that
i
have
never
thought
ill
of
you
for
an
instant
you
know
i
have
done
nothing
but
try
to
serve
you
i
have
bullied
you
yes
i
have
and
i
would
do
the
same
a
thousand
times
again
in
the
same
cause
you
are
wilful
and
obstinate
but
i
thank
god
i
am
more
wilful
and
obstinate
than
you
i
am
sick
of
this
fencing
and
diplomacy
and
irony
you
know
what
i
am
i
am
not
at
all
the
fine
gentleman
that
leaned
his
head
on
the
that
was
and
foolishness
i
am
a
bully
and
a
brute
you
have
told
me
so
oh
wailed
dolly
suddenly
no
longer
pretending
and
i
caught
the
note
in
her
voice
for
which
i
had
been
waiting
i
dropped
the
lantern
the
horses
plunged
violently
at
the
flare
and
the
crash
but
i
cared
nothing
for
that
i
dragged
furiously
on
the
bridle
and
as
the
horses
swung
together
i
caught
her
round
the
shoulders
and
kissed
her
fiercely
on
the
cheek
she
clung
to
me
weeping
chapter
v
well
i
had
beaten
her
at
last
and
in
the
only
way
in
which
she
would
yield
weakness
was
of
no
use
with
her
nor
gentleness
nor
even
that
lofty
patronage
which
poor
fool
i
had
shewn
her
in
the
parlour
at
hare
street
she
must
be
man
mate
which
is
certainly
a
rather
savage
relation
at
bottom
not
merely
his
pretty
and
grateful
wife
this
i
learned
from
her
as
we
rode
onwards
and
up
into
the
high
road
where
i
may
say
in
passing
there
was
no
sign
of
our
party
though
she
did
not
know
she
was
telling
it
me
oh
roger
she
said
and
i
thought
you
were
a
a
that
is
the
second
time
i
have
been
told
so
in
two
days
i
said
who
told
you
so
his
majesty
i
thought
his
majesty
was
wiser
said
she
he
has
been
pretty
wise
though
i
said
if
it
were
not
for
him
we
should
not
be
riding
here
together
i
suppose
you
made
him
do
that
too
she
said
but
it
was
not
only
of
dolly
that
i
had
learned
my
lessons
it
was
of
myself
also
i
was
astonished
how
inevitable
it
appeared
to
me
now
that
we
should
be
riding
together
on
such
terms
and
i
understood
that
never
for
one
instant
all
through
this
miserable
year
away
from
her
had
i
ever
interiorly
loosed
my
hold
upon
her
beneath
all
my
resolutions
and
wilful
distractions
the
intention
had
persevered
all
the
while
i
was
saying
to
myself
in
my
own
mind
that
i
should
never
see
dolly
again
something
that
was
not
my
mind
i
suppose
my
heart
was
telling
me
the
precise
opposite
well
the
heart
had
been
right
after
all
she
asked
me
presently
what
i
should
say
to
her
father
i
shall
forgive
him
a
great
deal
now
that
i
thought
i
never
should
i
said
with
wonderful
magnanimity
a
few
sharp
words
only
and
no
more
you
see
my
dear
it
was
through
his
sending
you
to
court
yes
yes
she
said
he
has
behaved
abominably
however
i
said
and
i
shall
tell
him
so
dolly
my
love
yes
said
she
i
must
go
back
very
soon
to
town
i
have
been
offered
a
piece
of
work
and
even
if
i
do
not
accept
it
i
must
speak
of
it
to
them
them
yes
my
dear
i
must
say
no
more
than
that
it
is
as
we
say
in
rome
and
to
think
that
you
were
a
benedictine
novice
exclaimed
dolly
we
talked
awhile
of
that
then
she
asked
me
a
number
of
questions
that
may
be
imagined
under
such
circumstances
and
my
answers
also
can
be
imagined
and
we
spoke
of
a
great
number
of
things
she
and
i
riding
side
by
side
in
the
dark
our
very
horses
friendly
one
with
another
she
telling
me
all
of
how
she
went
to
court
and
why
she
went
and
i
telling
her
my
side
of
the
affair
until
at
last
in
puckeridge
a
man
ran
out
from
the
inn
yard
to
say
that
our
party
was
within
and
waiting
for
us
they
had
met
it
appeared
a
rustic
fellow
who
had
set
them
right
soon
after
they
had
lost
us
i
do
not
know
what
they
thought
at
first
but
i
know
what
they
thought
in
the
end
for
i
rated
them
very
soundly
for
not
keeping
nearer
to
us
and
bade
james
ride
ahead
with
the
lantern
with
all
the
rest
between
and
dolly
and
i
in
the
rear
to
keep
them
from
straying
again
in
this
manner
then
did
she
and
i
contrive
to
have
a
great
deal
more
conversation
before
we
came
a
little
before
midnight
to
hare
street
the
village
was
all
dark
as
we
came
through
it
and
all
dark
was
the
house
when
we
pushed
open
the
yard
gates
and
rode
in
we
went
through
and
beat
upon
the
door
and
presently
heard
a
window
thrown
up
who
is
there
cried
my
cousin
tom
voice
i
bade
dolly
maid
answer
she
was
all
perplexed
poor
wench
at
the
change
of
relations
between
her
mistress
and
me
it
is
mistress
jermyn
sir
she
said
yes
father
i
have
come
back
cried
dolly
there
was
an
exclamation
from
poor
tom
and
in
two
or
three
minutes
we
saw
a
light
beneath
the
door
and
heard
him
drawing
the
bolts
i
pushed
dolly
and
her
maid
forward
as
the
door
opened
and
then
myself
strode
suddenly
forward
into
the
light
why
god
bless
cried
tom
who
was
in
his
coat
and
shoes
i
could
see
how
his
face
fell
when
he
saw
me
i
looked
at
him
very
grimly
but
i
said
nothing
to
him
at
once
for
i
was
sorely
tempted
to
laugh
at
his
apparition
but
turned
to
james
and
bade
him
see
to
the
rest
and
find
beds
somewhere
then
i
went
after
dolly
and
her
father
into
the
great
chamber
still
with
my
hat
on
my
head
and
looking
very
stern
he
was
talking
very
swiftly
in
a
low
voice
to
dolly
but
he
stopped
when
i
came
in
yes
cousin
tom
i
said
i
am
come
back
again
all
unlooked
for
as
i
see
but
good
god
he
cried
what
is
the
matter
and
why
is
dolly
here
i
was
but
just
asking
i
pulled
out
the
king
paper
which
i
had
all
ready
and
thrust
it
down
before
the
lantern
that
he
had
put
on
the
table
and
i
waited
till
he
had
read
it
through
there
cousin
i
said
when
he
was
staring
on
me
again
that
is
enough
warrant
for
both
you
and
me
i
think
have
you
anything
to
say
he
began
to
bluster
cousin
i
said
if
i
have
any
patience
it
is
because
dolly
has
given
it
back
to
me
you
had
best
not
say
too
much
you
have
done
all
the
harm
you
could
and
it
is
only
by
god
mercy
that
it
has
not
been
greater
he
said
that
he
was
dolly
father
and
could
do
as
he
pleased
besides
she
herself
had
consented
i
know
that
i
said
because
she
has
told
me
so
and
that
it
was
in
despair
that
she
went
because
we
two
fools
bungled
our
business
well
you
may
be
her
father
but
the
scripture
tells
us
that
a
woman
must
leave
her
father
and
cleave
to
her
husband
and
that
is
what
i
am
to
be
to
her
well
when
i
said
that
there
was
the
devil
to
pay
we
three
standing
there
in
the
cold
chamber
with
the
draughts
playing
upon
poor
legs
he
looked
a
very
piteous
object
very
much
fallen
from
that
fine
figure
that
he
had
presented
when
i
had
first
set
eyes
on
him
but
he
strove
to
compensate
by
emphasis
what
he
lacked
in
dignity
he
said
that
he
had
changed
his
mind
that
even
third
cousins
once
removed
should
not
marry
that
he
had
now
other
designs
for
his
daughter
that
i
had
no
right
to
dictate
to
him
in
his
own
house
he
waxed
wonderfully
warm
but
even
then
in
the
first
flush
of
his
resistance
i
thought
i
saw
a
kind
of
wavering
i
sat
with
one
leg
across
the
corner
of
the
great
table
until
he
was
done
while
dolly
sat
in
a
chair
turning
her
merry
eyes
from
the
one
to
the
other
of
us
for
myself
i
felt
no
lack
of
confidence
i
had
beaten
the
daughter
now
i
was
to
beat
the
father
when
he
had
finished
and
drew
breath
i
stood
up
very
bravely
said
cousin
bare
legs
and
all
i
said
we
will
speak
of
it
all
again
but
now
for
a
bite
we
have
been
riding
since
noon
it
was
very
strange
to
go
upstairs
again
after
a
mouthful
or
two
and
a
glass
of
warm
ale
and
see
my
chamber
again
from
which
i
had
departed
in
such
unhappiness
near
a
twelvemonth
ago
james
had
made
a
little
fire
for
me
before
which
i
drew
off
my
boots
and
undressed
myself
for
it
was
from
this
very
chamber
that
i
had
gone
forth
in
such
despair
when
dolly
had
said
that
she
would
not
have
me
and
now
here
i
was
in
it
again
all
glowing
with
my
ride
and
my
drink
and
my
great
content
having
kissed
dolly
just
now
in
her
father
presence
as
a
symbol
of
our
troth
and
so
i
went
to
bed
and
dreamed
and
woke
and
dreamed
again
we
had
our
talk
out
next
morning
tom
pacing
up
and
down
the
great
chamber
until
i
entreated
him
for
god
sake
to
sit
down
and
save
my
stiff
neck
he
was
very
high
at
first
but
i
was
astonished
how
quickly
he
came
down
that
is
very
well
i
said
to
speak
now
of
better
prospects
for
dolly
but
you
will
do
me
the
honour
of
remembering
my
dear
cousin
that
in
this
very
room
once
you
spoke
to
me
very
differently
if
you
have
changed
your
mind
you
might
at
least
have
told
me
so
for
i
have
not
changed
mine
at
all
and
dolly
it
seems
is
come
round
to
my
way
of
thinking
at
last
but
how
did
you
do
it
asked
he
stopping
in
his
walk
i
lost
my
temper
altogether
said
i
and
that
is
a
very
good
way
if
you
have
tried
all
the
rest
but
the
king
man
the
king
how
did
you
get
that
paper
out
of
him
why
his
majesty
himself
i
am
told
took
particular
notice
eh
said
i
that
is
no
matter
now
he
said
what
were
you
going
to
say
i
must
have
that
first
said
tom
began
to
pace
the
floor
again
it
is
nothing
at
all
cousin
it
is
that
his
majesty
spoke
very
kindly
to
my
daughter
upon
her
first
coming
to
court
i
am
glad
i
did
not
know
that
i
said
or
i
might
have
said
more
to
him
well
but
what
did
you
say
now
i
was
in
half
a
dozen
minds
as
to
what
i
should
tell
him
he
knew
for
certain
nothing
at
all
of
my
comings
and
goings
and
of
what
i
did
for
the
king
yet
i
thought
that
he
must
have
guessed
a
good
deal
i
judged
it
safer
therefore
to
tell
him
a
little
to
stop
his
month
but
not
too
much
why
i
said
very
carefully
i
have
been
of
a
little
service
to
the
king
and
his
majesty
was
good
enough
to
ask
me
if
there
were
any
little
favour
he
could
do
me
so
that
is
what
i
asked
him
tom
stopped
in
his
pacing
again
and
it
was
then
that
i
entreated
him
to
sit
down
and
talk
like
a
christian
he
did
so
without
a
word
in
france
i
suppose
he
said
immediately
after
why
yes
tom
looked
at
me
again
and
you
travel
with
four
men
now
instead
of
one
i
find
it
more
convenient
i
said
and
more
expensive
too
he
observed
why
yes
a
little
more
expensive
too
i
answered
but
i
was
a
shade
uneasy
because
this
increase
of
servants
was
at
his
majesty
desire
and
cost
i
made
haste
to
turn
the
conversation
back
once
more
i
did
not
wish
tom
to
think
that
i
was
of
any
importance
at
all
well
but
what
of
dolly
i
said
it
was
then
that
my
cousin
suddenly
came
down
from
his
loftiness
he
seemed
to
awake
out
of
a
little
reverie
you
come
into
the
enjoyment
of
your
property
he
said
in
four
years
from
now
in
less
than
that
i
said
it
is
three
years
and
a
half
my
birthday
is
in
june
he
asked
me
one
or
two
more
questions
then
as
to
its
amount
and
what
arrangements
i
would
make
in
the
event
of
my
marriage
when
i
had
satisfied
him
upon
these
matters
he
fell
again
into
a
reverie
well
said
i
a
little
sharply
cousin
he
said
i
do
not
wish
to
stand
in
your
way
but
there
must
be
no
talk
of
marriage
till
will
that
content
you
it
did
not
in
the
least
but
it
was
what
i
had
expected
i
was
scarcely
rich
enough
yet
to
support
a
wife
and
knew
that
well
enough
for
if
i
married
and
left
the
king
service
there
would
be
no
more
travelling
expenses
for
me
dolly
and
i
last
night
had
agreed
upon
that
as
the
least
that
we
could
consent
to
four
years
is
a
long
time
said
i
you
said
three
and
a
half
just
now
he
observed
a
little
bitterly
well
three
and
a
half
i
suppose
i
must
take
that
if
i
can
get
nothing
better
now
i
was
secretly
a
little
astonished
that
my
cousin
tom
had
consented
so
quickly
after
his
recent
ambitions
plainly
he
had
aimed
higher
than
at
my
poor
standard
during
those
months
for
when
a
maid
went
to
court
as
one
of
the
queen
ladies
the
least
that
was
expected
of
her
was
that
she
would
marry
a
pretty
rich
man
but
the
reason
of
it
all
was
unpleasantly
evident
to
me
he
must
have
gathered
from
what
i
had
said
and
done
that
my
favour
was
increasing
with
the
king
and
therefore
he
must
have
argued
too
that
i
must
be
serving
his
majesty
in
some
very
particular
way
which
was
the
very
last
thing
i
desired
him
to
know
as
he
was
such
a
gossip
but
i
dared
say
no
more
then
we
grasped
one
another
hands
very
heartily
and
then
i
went
to
find
dolly
the
days
that
followed
were
very
happy
ones
though
as
i
shall
presently
relate
they
were
to
be
interrupted
once
more
i
had
in
my
mind
during
them
all
that
i
must
soon
go
up
to
london
again
to
tell
chiffinch
my
final
decision
that
i
could
not
undertake
the
work
that
he
had
proposed
to
me
for
i
had
spoken
of
it
at
some
length
with
dolly
giving
her
a
confidence
that
i
dared
not
give
to
her
father
but
i
did
not
think
that
i
should
have
to
go
so
soon
it
was
in
the
hour
before
supper
one
evening
that
i
told
her
of
it
as
we
sat
in
the
tapestried
parlour
looking
into
the
fire
from
the
settle
where
we
sat
together
my
dear
said
i
i
wish
to
ask
your
advice
but
it
is
a
very
private
matter
indeed
tell
me
said
dolly
contentedly
her
hand
was
in
mine
and
she
looked
extraordinary
pretty
in
the
firelight
i
am
asked
whether
i
will
undertake
a
little
work
in
itself
it
is
excellent
it
concerns
the
protection
of
his
majesty
but
it
is
the
means
that
i
am
doubtful
about
then
i
told
her
that
of
the
details
of
the
how
and
the
when
and
the
where
i
knew
no
more
than
she
but
that
if
all
went
well
i
might
find
myself
trusted
by
a
traitor
and
that
i
was
considering
whether
in
such
a
cause
as
this
it
was
a
work
to
which
i
could
put
my
hand
to
betray
that
trust
if
i
got
it
but
before
i
was
done
speaking
i
knew
that
i
could
not
so
wonderfully
does
speaking
to
another
clear
one
mind
and
that
though
i
could
not
condemn
outright
a
man
who
thought
fit
to
do
so
any
more
than
i
would
condemn
a
scavenger
for
cleaning
the
gutter
it
was
not
work
for
a
gentleman
to
seek
out
a
confidence
that
he
might
betray
it
again
now
that
i
have
put
it
into
words
i
said
i
see
that
it
can
not
be
done
certainly
it
would
advance
me
very
much
with
his
majesty
and
that
is
one
reason
why
i
spoke
to
you
of
it
but
such
advance
would
be
too
dearly
bought
do
you
not
think
so
too
my
dear
she
nodded
slowly
and
very
emphatically
three
or
four
times
without
speaking
as
her
manner
was
then
that
is
decided
said
i
and
in
a
day
or
two
i
will
go
to
town
and
tell
them
so
so
we
put
the
matter
away
then
and
spoke
of
matters
far
more
dear
to
both
of
us
until
tom
came
in
and
exclaimed
at
our
sitting
in
the
dark
as
he
called
it
the
interruption
came
that
very
night
we
were
at
supper
and
speaking
of
christmas
and
of
how
we
would
have
again
the
dancing
as
last
year
when
we
heard
a
man
ride
past
the
house
pulling
up
his
horse
as
he
came
such
interruptions
came
pretty
often
it
was
so
that
i
had
been
first
sent
for
by
chiffinch
and
it
was
so
again
that
the
duke
of
monmouth
had
come
and
others
but
we
had
plenty
too
of
others
who
came
seeing
the
house
at
the
end
of
the
village
to
ask
their
way
or
what
not
so
we
paid
no
attention
to
it
presently
however
we
heard
a
man
steps
come
along
the
paved
walk
and
then
a
knocking
at
the
door
james
went
out
to
see
who
was
there
and
came
back
immediately
saying
that
it
was
a
courier
with
a
letter
for
me
my
conscience
smote
me
a
little
for
i
had
delayed
more
than
a
week
now
from
answering
chiffinch
and
sure
enough
when
i
went
out
the
man
was
come
from
him
i
took
the
letter
he
gave
me
into
the
great
chamber
to
read
it
and
was
astonished
at
its
contents
there
were
but
four
lines
in
it
mallock
it
ran
come
immediately
that
is
the
lord
hath
delivered
them
into
our
hands
ride
by
amwell
and
go
through
the
place
slowly
between
eleven
and
twelve
with
no
servant
near
and
it
was
signed
with
his
initials
only
i
went
back
again
into
the
immediately
and
shut
the
door
behind
me
i
must
go
to
town
i
said
all
short
dolly
looked
up
at
me
gone
a
little
white
i
shook
my
head
and
smiled
at
her
but
secretly
so
that
tom
did
not
see
chapter
vi
i
do
not
think
that
i
have
yet
related
how
great
was
the
work
that
chiffinch
had
done
in
the
matter
of
the
spies
that
he
had
everywhere
during
those
later
years
of
his
majesty
charles
the
second
that
which
he
had
done
during
monmouth
progress
in
the
north
his
receiving
of
reports
day
by
day
and
even
hour
by
hour
this
was
only
one
instance
of
his
activity
the
men
or
even
the
gentlemen
whom
i
had
met
on
his
stairs
so
continually
or
for
whose
sake
i
was
kept
waiting
sometimes
when
i
went
to
see
him
these
were
his
tools
and
messengers
this
company
of
spies
was
of
all
grades
and
it
was
to
serve
in
that
company
that
he
had
sent
for
me
from
france
and
that
i
was
determined
to
decline
though
however
i
was
so
determined
i
did
not
dare
to
disobey
the
directions
that
his
letter
gave
me
for
i
could
not
be
sure
that
it
was
for
this
work
in
particular
that
he
had
summoned
me
though
i
guessed
that
it
was
i
would
go
thought
i
and
do
in
everything
as
he
had
said
i
would
ride
through
amwell
with
my
servants
behind
at
a
good
distance
i
would
see
what
befell
me
there
for
that
something
would
was
certain
from
the
letter
then
i
would
proceed
on
to
london
and
if
the
affair
were
against
my
honour
as
i
was
sure
it
would
be
i
would
refuse
any
further
part
in
it
my
one
hardship
was
that
i
could
do
no
more
than
tell
dolly
in
private
that
i
would
hold
to
my
resolution
i
dared
not
tell
her
anything
of
the
contents
of
the
letter
which
i
had
immediately
destroyed
i
promised
her
that
i
would
be
back
for
christmas
at
the
latest
she
came
out
to
the
to
wish
me
my
servants
were
gone
in
front
and
my
cousin
tom
had
the
sense
to
be
out
of
the
way
so
our
were
all
that
such
miserable
things
ever
can
be
i
waved
to
her
at
the
corner
and
she
waved
back
when
we
came
about
two
miles
to
the
north
of
amwell
which
we
did
about
eleven
as
i
had
been
bid
i
bade
my
servants
stay
behind
and
not
come
after
me
till
half
an
hour
later
further
i
bade
them
if
when
they
came
they
found
me
in
any
man
company
neither
to
salute
me
nor
to
make
any
sign
of
recognition
but
to
pass
straight
on
to
hoddesdon
and
wait
for
me
there
not
at
the
inn
where
i
was
known
but
at
another
little
one
the
at
the
further
end
of
the
village
and
there
they
were
to
dine
even
then
when
i
came
if
i
did
they
were
not
to
salute
me
until
i
had
spoken
with
them
all
this
i
did
interpreting
as
well
as
i
could
what
chiffinch
had
said
and
they
since
they
were
in
that
kind
of
service
understood
me
perfectly
it
was
near
eleven
when
i
came
riding
very
slowly
into
the
village
street
looking
this
way
and
that
so
as
to
shew
my
face
but
as
if
i
were
just
looking
about
me
i
noticed
a
couple
of
servants
in
a
very
plain
livery
which
i
thought
i
had
seen
before
in
the
yard
of
the
but
they
paid
no
attention
to
me
so
i
passed
up
the
street
to
the
end
and
no
one
spoke
with
me
or
shewed
any
sign
now
i
knew
that
there
was
something
forward
and
that
unless
i
fell
in
with
it
the
arrangement
would
have
failed
so
i
turned
again
and
rode
back
as
if
i
were
looking
for
an
inn
again
no
one
spoke
with
me
so
i
rode
as
if
discontented
into
the
yard
of
the
and
demanded
of
an
ostler
whether
there
was
any
food
fit
to
eat
there
he
looked
at
me
in
a
kind
of
hesitation
yes
sir
he
said
but
but
the
parlour
is
full
a
party
is
there
from
london
then
i
knew
that
i
had
been
right
to
come
because
at
the
same
moment
i
remembered
where
i
had
seen
those
liveries
before
they
were
those
worn
by
the
men
who
had
come
with
monmouth
to
hare
street
i
said
nothing
to
the
ostler
but
slipped
off
my
horse
as
he
took
the
bridle
and
went
indoors
the
fellow
called
out
after
me
but
i
made
as
if
i
did
not
hear
i
have
found
more
than
once
that
a
little
deafness
is
a
very
good
thing
there
were
voices
i
heard
talking
beyond
a
door
at
the
end
of
the
passage
i
went
up
to
this
and
without
knocking
lifted
the
latch
and
went
in
the
room
that
looked
out
with
one
window
only
into
a
small
enclosed
garden
was
full
of
men
there
were
eight
of
them
as
i
counted
presently
all
round
a
table
on
which
stood
a
couple
of
tall
jugs
and
tankards
i
raised
my
hand
to
my
hat
i
beg
pardon
gentlemen
is
there
room
why
it
is
i
heard
a
voice
say
suddenly
stifled
beyond
that
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
then
a
man
stood
up
suddenly
with
a
kind
of
eagerness
mallock
he
said
mallock
do
you
not
remember
me
your
back
is
to
the
light
sir
i
began
and
then
why
it
is
mr
rumbald
the
same
sir
the
same
there
is
a
friend
of
yours
here
sir
come
in
and
sit
down
sir
there
is
plenty
of
room
for
another
friend
there
was
a
very
curious
kind
of
eagerness
in
the
maltster
voice
which
puzzled
me
not
a
little
and
there
was
a
change
of
manner
too
in
him
that
puzzled
me
no
less
he
spoke
as
if
he
had
almost
expected
me
or
was
peculiarly
astonished
to
see
me
there
and
there
was
none
of
that
air
about
him
any
more
he
spoke
to
me
as
to
a
gentleman
as
indeed
i
shewed
i
was
by
my
dress
but
yet
manifested
no
surprise
at
seeing
me
so
however
i
had
neither
time
nor
thought
to
consider
this
at
the
moment
for
the
friend
of
mine
of
whom
he
spoke
and
who
was
now
standing
up
to
greet
me
was
no
other
than
my
lord
essex
he
who
had
been
riding
with
monmouth
from
newmarket
and
he
whose
name
chiffinch
had
expressly
spoken
of
to
me
yet
how
did
rumbald
know
that
we
knew
one
another
i
made
haste
to
salute
him
for
he
too
i
thought
had
an
air
of
eagerness
come
in
and
sit
down
mallock
he
said
we
have
dined
early
and
are
presently
off
to
town
again
are
you
riding
our
way
why
yes
i
said
i
am
going
up
to
my
lodgings
for
a
little
as
i
spoke
a
thousand
questions
beseiged
me
why
was
there
this
air
of
expectation
in
them
at
all
how
did
chiffinch
know
that
they
would
be
here
at
this
time
why
had
he
arranged
that
i
should
meet
them
why
had
he
not
spoken
of
their
names
to
me
since
he
had
told
me
so
freely
of
them
before
well
i
must
wait
thought
i
and
meantime
go
very
gingerly
i
was
not
going
to
put
my
hand
to
this
kind
of
work
but
i
did
not
wish
to
spoil
chiffinch
design
if
i
could
help
it
why
said
my
lord
if
you
are
going
to
town
may
i
not
ride
with
you
some
of
these
gentlemen
are
in
a
hurry
but
i
am
sure
i
am
not
have
you
no
servants
mr
mallock
i
have
sent
mine
on
before
i
said
marvelling
more
than
ever
at
the
man
friendliness
but
i
shall
be
very
happy
to
ride
with
your
lordship
if
you
can
wait
till
i
have
dined
my
lord
said
a
word
to
a
man
who
sat
near
the
door
who
slipped
out
and
i
heard
his
voice
ordering
dinner
for
me
meantime
i
observed
the
company
there
were
eight
as
i
have
said
but
i
knew
for
certain
two
only
the
maltster
and
my
lord
essex
the
rest
puzzled
me
not
a
little
they
seemed
fellows
enough
but
they
were
dressed
very
plainly
and
appeared
no
more
than
country
squires
or
lawyers
or
suchlike
they
were
talking
of
the
most
indifferent
things
in
the
world
with
silences
as
if
they
wondered
what
next
to
speak
of
they
hardly
looked
at
me
at
all
after
a
minute
or
two
and
presently
one
by
one
began
to
stand
up
and
take
their
leave
saluting
my
lord
by
name
and
bowing
only
to
me
by
the
time
that
my
dinner
came
there
were
left
only
my
lord
who
was
very
attentive
to
me
and
rumbald
and
before
i
was
well
even
rumbald
stood
up
to
say
again
i
was
puzzled
by
the
man
for
again
he
appeared
very
friendly
with
me
and
again
shewed
no
sign
of
astonishment
at
my
acquaintance
with
my
lord
and
at
my
appearance
as
a
gentleman
i
am
very
glad
sir
he
said
shaking
my
hand
with
great
warmth
that
you
will
have
so
pleasant
a
ride
to
town
with
your
friend
and
you
will
remember
my
house
too
will
you
not
over
the
river
if
ever
you
are
by
that
way
i
told
him
that
i
would
and
thanked
him
for
his
courtesy
and
he
went
out
after
shaking
hands
too
with
my
lord
taking
care
to
exchange
no
glances
with
him
though
it
would
be
evident
even
to
a
child
that
there
was
some
secret
between
them
when
he
was
gone
my
lord
turned
to
me
a
very
good
fellow
rumbald
a
very
good
fellow
indeed
i
assented
heartily
honest
as
the
day
said
my
lord
there
is
no
doubt
of
it
said
i
with
my
mouth
full
and
a
good
patriot
too
it
is
what
we
want
mr
mallock
again
i
assented
and
my
lord
presently
changed
the
conversation
during
the
rest
of
dinner
he
said
nothing
that
was
significant
of
any
of
the
things
i
suspected
i
knew
now
beyond
a
doubt
both
from
what
chiffinch
had
said
and
from
the
strangely
mixed
company
and
the
circumstances
under
which
i
found
them
that
something
was
forward
but
as
to
what
it
was
all
about
i
knew
no
more
than
the
dead
neither
did
i
as
yet
see
a
single
glimmer
of
light
on
the
questions
that
had
puzzled
me
just
now
so
i
determined
that
when
we
were
safe
out
on
the
lonely
road
i
would
throw
a
bait
or
two
though
my
resolution
still
held
that
i
would
do
no
dirty
work
even
for
his
majesty
himself
i
dined
very
tolerably
and
lit
a
pipe
afterwards
my
lord
told
me
that
he
used
no
tobacco
and
presently
in
a
kind
of
impatience
for
indeed
the
position
i
found
myself
in
was
a
little
disconcerting
i
observed
that
it
was
past
noon
you
are
quite
right
said
my
lord
quite
right
i
will
tell
them
to
have
the
horses
ready
your
servants
are
gone
on
before
i
think
you
said
mr
mallock
i
told
him
yes
but
i
wondered
why
he
did
not
shout
for
the
maid
instead
of
going
out
himself
but
i
understood
the
reason
when
i
found
presently
when
we
took
the
road
that
his
own
men
kept
a
full
hundred
yards
in
the
rear
evidently
he
had
gone
out
to
tell
them
to
do
so
so
soon
as
we
were
clear
of
amwell
i
began
there
was
a
little
wind
and
the
weather
was
moist
and
thick
so
there
was
no
danger
of
our
being
overheard
my
lord
i
said
i
am
very
much
puzzled
by
what
i
have
seen
eh
said
he
it
was
a
very
mixed
company
just
now
in
amwell
he
frowned
a
little
very
excellent
gentlemen
all
of
them
i
hastened
to
add
but
i
was
wondering
what
it
was
that
drew
them
all
together
i
can
only
think
of
two
things
what
are
they
mr
mallock
asked
my
lord
a
little
eagerly
religion
or
politics
my
lord
i
said
and
i
am
sure
that
it
is
not
the
first
he
appeared
to
reflect
but
he
was
not
a
very
good
actor
and
i
could
see
that
it
was
feigned
why
you
are
very
sharp
sir
he
said
you
have
put
your
finger
on
the
very
place
the
very
place
and
he
continued
with
far
too
short
a
pause
on
which
side
are
you
mallock
for
the
country
or
for
the
court
that
is
a
dangerous
question
to
answer
my
lord
i
said
very
short
it
is
only
dangerous
for
one
side
said
he
i
nodded
in
a
grave
and
philosophical
manner
then
i
sighed
you
are
quite
right
my
lord
i
could
see
that
he
was
glancing
at
me
continually
yet
no
explanation
of
his
behaviour
yet
crossed
my
mind
mallock
said
he
after
a
silence
it
is
no
good
fencing
about
the
question
i
can
see
that
you
are
disaffected
that
is
a
very
safe
way
to
put
it
i
said
who
is
not
on
one
side
or
the
other
yes
said
he
but
you
are
sharp
enough
to
know
what
i
mean
again
i
nodded
but
my
mind
was
working
like
a
mill
for
a
new
thought
had
come
to
me
that
seemed
to
illumine
all
the
rest
and
yet
i
could
not
understand
the
thought
was
this
plainly
my
lord
essex
knew
a
good
deal
about
me
he
knew
enough
that
is
to
begin
a
conversation
of
this
kind
with
one
whom
he
had
only
met
once
before
a
mad
proceeding
altogether
if
that
were
all
he
knew
thought
i
he
must
know
more
than
that
and
if
he
knew
more
he
must
know
that
i
was
in
the
service
of
his
majesty
and
presumably
devoted
to
that
service
probably
too
from
the
understanding
between
himself
and
rumbald
he
knew
that
i
had
chosen
on
previous
occasions
to
masquerade
as
if
i
were
not
a
gentleman
was
he
quite
mad
then
for
to
talk
like
this
to
one
in
the
confidence
of
his
majesty
was
surely
a
crazed
proceeding
yet
my
lord
essex
was
not
a
fool
looking
back
upon
the
matter
as
i
write
it
is
hard
for
me
to
understand
why
i
did
not
see
through
his
design
since
i
saw
so
much
of
it
yet
it
was
not
until
london
was
in
sight
or
rather
its
lights
against
the
sky
that
all
fell
into
its
place
and
i
wondered
at
the
simplicity
of
it
i
think
that
it
was
the
way
he
talked
to
me
the
manner
in
which
he
skirted
continually
on
the
fringe
of
treason
yet
said
nothing
that
i
could
lay
hold
upon
and
above
all
mentioned
no
names
that
gave
me
the
clue
i
fear
i
fell
a
little
silent
as
i
perceived
how
point
after
point
ratified
the
conclusion
to
which
i
had
come
but
i
do
not
think
he
noticed
it
and
even
if
he
did
it
would
only
encourage
him
the
more
and
when
i
saw
the
whole
as
plain
as
a
map
my
scruples
left
me
altogether
i
would
not
have
betrayed
the
true
confidence
of
this
man
or
of
any
other
that
resolution
still
held
firm
but
this
was
another
matter
altogether
by
the
time
that
we
reached
covent
garden
for
he
rode
with
me
as
far
as
that
i
think
he
was
satisfied
that
he
had
caught
me
in
the
way
that
he
wished
for
he
had
given
me
the
names
of
one
or
two
places
where
i
could
communicate
with
him
if
i
desired
and
was
nearer
actual
treason
in
his
talk
than
ever
before
though
he
did
not
go
much
beyond
deploring
the
popish
succession
and
feigning
that
he
did
not
know
that
i
was
a
catholic
and
on
my
side
i
had
feigned
to
be
greatly
interested
in
all
that
he
had
said
and
had
let
him
see
though
not
too
evidently
that
it
was
feigning
on
my
side
too
we
parted
outwardly
the
best
of
friends
inwardly
we
were
at
one
another
throats
so
soon
as
i
had
dismounted
he
having
left
me
in
the
strand
and
gone
indoors
i
came
out
again
not
fearing
indeed
rather
hoping
that
he
would
be
watching
for
me
and
in
my
boots
just
as
i
was
set
out
for
whitehall
chiffinch
was
within
expecting
me
even
he
looked
a
little
excited
and
no
wonder
but
first
i
made
him
answer
my
questions
before
i
would
say
a
word
beyond
telling
him
that
his
design
had
prospered
chiffinch
said
i
over
my
supper
which
he
had
brought
for
me
to
his
parlour
before
i
say
one
more
word
you
must
tell
me
three
or
four
things
the
first
is
this
how
did
you
know
that
it
was
in
me
that
my
lord
essex
would
confide
that
is
easily
answered
said
he
my
men
told
me
that
my
lord
was
after
you
everywhere
both
in
your
lodgings
and
here
ah
i
said
and
was
there
a
fellow
called
rumbald
with
him
you
are
right
he
said
how
did
you
know
that
wait
i
said
the
next
is
if
you
could
tell
me
so
much
in
your
letter
why
did
you
not
tell
me
the
names
of
the
persons
he
smiled
mallock
he
said
from
your
hesitation
i
knew
that
you
would
refuse
to
do
such
work
as
this
so
i
intended
to
catch
you
unawares
and
to
entangle
you
in
it
i
knew
that
you
would
not
refuse
to
go
to
amwell
and
behave
there
as
i
directed
if
i
said
no
more
than
i
did
well
you
would
have
failed
i
said
what
said
he
you
are
still
going
to
refuse
no
said
i
i
accept
the
work
but
it
is
not
what
you
think
it
is
why
what
is
it
then
wait
i
said
the
next
is
how
did
you
know
that
they
would
be
at
amwell
at
that
time
oh
that
is
easy
enough
one
of
my
fellows
got
that
out
of
one
of
rumbald
maids
that
a
party
of
six
would
lie
at
the
ryehouse
last
night
and
that
they
would
meet
two
more
at
dinner
in
amwell
at
eleven
rumbald
has
been
known
to
us
a
long
while
but
it
is
the
others
we
are
waiting
for
i
was
silent
there
were
no
more
questions
i
wished
to
ask
at
present
though
there
might
be
others
later
well
said
the
page
a
little
eagerly
and
his
narrow
face
looked
very
like
a
fox
as
he
spoke
well
and
what
is
your
news
i
finished
my
stew
and
laid
down
the
spoon
chiffinch
said
i
let
me
first
ask
one
more
question
why
do
you
think
that
my
lord
essex
was
after
me
at
all
how
did
he
know
of
me
plainly
from
rumbald
said
he
and
why
did
he
want
me
he
smiled
why
rumbald
thinks
you
disaffected
towards
the
king
and
yet
knows
you
are
in
his
service
you
would
be
a
very
great
helper
to
them
if
you
cared
it
was
my
turn
to
smile
my
lord
essex
is
not
a
fool
i
said
if
they
know
so
much
of
me
would
they
not
know
more
plainly
they
do
not
he
said
or
they
would
not
have
tried
to
get
you
on
their
side
i
laughed
softly
sir
i
said
you
are
very
sharp
but
you
are
not
sharp
enough
then
i
related
to
him
the
behaviour
of
them
all
in
the
inn
and
how
rumbald
had
shewn
no
surprise
in
seeing
that
i
was
a
gentleman
after
all
and
how
my
lord
essex
had
talked
in
what
would
have
been
the
maddest
manner
if
his
intention
had
been
as
chiffinch
had
thought
it
to
be
and
with
every
word
that
i
said
the
page
face
grew
longer
well
he
cried
it
is
beyond
me
altogether
what
then
is
the
explanation
my
friend
i
said
you
were
right
neither
before
nor
after
what
has
passed
would
i
have
done
the
work
you
designed
for
me
which
was
to
get
these
men
confidence
and
then
betray
it
again
but
it
is
not
their
idea
to
give
me
their
confidence
at
all
so
i
will
work
with
you
very
gladly
but
then
what
can
you
do
he
began
in
amazement
listen
i
said
it
will
fall
out
just
as
i
say
they
will
give
me
very
few
names
they
will
admit
me
to
none
of
their
real
secrets
but
yet
they
will
feign
to
do
so
but
what
a
god
name
oh
man
i
cried
you
are
surely
they
will
do
all
this
i
leaned
forward
as
i
spoke
for
further
emphasis
order
that
i
may
hand
it
on
to
his
but
they
will
give
me
no
real
secret
till
the
climax
is
come
and
their
designs
perfected
and
then
they
will
give
me
a
false
one
altogether
they
think
that
they
will
make
me
a
tool
to
further
their
true
plans
by
betraying
false
ones
we
may
know
this
for
certain
then
that
whatever
they
tell
me
knowing
that
i
will
tell
you
is
not
what
they
intend
but
something
else
altogether
and
it
will
not
be
hard
to
know
the
truth
if
we
are
certified
of
what
is
false
there
was
complete
silence
in
the
room
when
i
had
finished
except
for
the
wash
of
the
tide
outside
the
windows
the
man
mouth
was
open
and
his
eyes
set
in
thought
then
sense
came
back
to
his
face
and
he
smiled
suddenly
and
widely
god
he
said
and
slapped
me
suddenly
on
the
thigh
good
god
you
have
hit
it
i
believe
chapter
vii
from
now
onwards
there
began
for
me
such
a
series
of
complications
that
i
all
but
despair
of
making
clear
even
the
course
that
they
ran
my
diaries
are
filled
with
notes
and
initials
and
dates
which
i
dared
not
at
the
time
set
down
more
explicitly
and
my
memory
is
often
confused
between
them
for
indeed
my
work
in
france
was
but
child
play
to
this
neither
was
there
any
danger
in
france
such
as
was
here
for
consider
what
not
a
double
part
merely
but
a
triple
i
had
to
play
the
gentlemen
who
were
beginning
at
this
time
to
conspire
in
real
earnest
against
the
king
and
the
constitution
some
of
whom
afterwards
such
as
my
lord
russell
suffered
death
for
it
and
others
of
whom
like
my
lord
howard
of
escrick
escaped
by
turning
king
evidence
although
their
guilt
was
very
various
these
gentlemen
through
my
lord
essex
had
got
at
me
as
they
thought
to
betray
not
truth
but
falsehood
to
his
majesty
and
told
me
matters
under
promise
of
secrecy
which
they
intended
me
to
tell
to
the
king
and
his
advisers
to
them
therefore
i
had
to
feign
feigning
i
had
to
feign
that
is
that
i
was
feigning
to
keep
their
confidence
but
that
in
reality
that
i
was
betraying
it
while
to
chiffinch
i
had
to
disclose
these
precious
secrets
not
as
true
but
as
false
and
conjecture
with
him
what
was
the
truth
my
evidence
later
was
never
called
upon
nor
did
my
name
appear
in
any
way
for
that
the
jury
would
never
have
understood
it
i
had
therefore
a
double
danger
to
guard
against
first
that
which
came
from
the
conspirators
the
fear
that
they
should
discover
i
was
tricking
them
or
rather
that
i
had
discovered
their
trickery
and
on
the
other
side
that
i
should
become
involved
with
them
in
the
fall
that
was
so
certain
from
the
beginning
and
be
myself
accused
of
conspiracy
or
of
misprision
of
treason
at
the
least
against
the
latter
i
guarded
as
well
as
i
could
by
revealing
to
chiffinch
every
least
incident
so
soon
as
it
happened
and
on
three
occasions
in
the
following
year
having
a
long
discourse
with
his
majesty
but
against
the
former
danger
i
had
only
my
wits
to
protect
me
the
best
thing
therefore
that
i
can
do
is
to
relate
a
few
of
the
events
that
happened
to
me
i
have
never
i
think
experienced
such
a
strain
on
my
wits
for
it
went
on
for
a
good
deal
more
than
a
year
since
i
could
for
a
long
time
arrive
at
no
certain
proofs
of
the
guilt
of
the
conspirators
and
his
majesty
did
not
wish
to
strike
until
their
conviction
was
assured
the
first
meeting
of
the
conspirators
to
which
i
was
admitted
was
in
january
i
had
not
been
able
of
course
to
go
to
hare
street
for
christmas
but
the
letters
i
had
now
and
again
from
dolly
greatly
encouraged
and
comforted
me
i
had
told
her
that
i
was
keeping
to
my
resolution
but
that
i
should
be
in
some
peril
for
a
good
while
to
come
and
begged
her
to
remember
me
often
in
her
pure
prayers
a
fellow
came
to
my
lodgings
about
the
middle
of
january
with
a
letter
from
my
lord
essex
it
ran
as
follows
sir
with
regard
to
some
matters
of
which
we
spoke
together
on
the
occasion
of
our
very
pleasant
ride
to
town
last
month
i
am
very
anxious
to
see
you
again
pray
do
not
write
any
answer
to
this
but
if
you
can
meet
me
on
thursday
night
at
the
house
of
my
friend
west
in
creed
lane
at
nine
we
may
have
a
little
conversation
with
some
other
friends
of
ours
i
am
sir
your
obliged
servant
essex
i
told
the
fellow
that
the
answer
was
yes
my
lord
had
been
to
see
me
in
covent
garden
twice
but
had
said
very
little
that
was
at
all
explicit
but
chiffinch
had
bid
me
hold
myself
in
readiness
and
put
aside
all
else
for
the
further
invitations
that
would
surely
come
and
so
it
had
i
found
the
house
without
difficulty
and
was
shewn
into
a
little
parlour
near
the
door
where
presently
my
lord
came
to
me
alone
all
smiles
i
am
very
glad
you
are
come
mallock
he
said
i
was
sure
that
you
would
i
have
a
few
friends
here
who
meet
to
talk
politics
and
they
would
greatly
like
to
hear
your
views
on
the
points
i
think
i
may
now
venture
to
say
that
we
know
who
you
are
mallock
and
that
you
have
done
a
good
deal
for
his
majesty
in
france
your
opinion
then
would
be
of
the
greatest
interest
to
us
all
i
understood
why
he
put
so
much
emphasis
on
france
it
was
to
quiet
me
as
to
any
suspicions
they
thought
i
might
have
as
to
my
being
the
servant
in
england
too
i
answered
him
very
civilly
smiling
as
if
i
was
at
my
ease
and
after
a
word
or
two
more
he
took
me
in
it
was
a
long
low
room
with
a
beamed
ceiling
and
shuttered
windows
in
which
the
men
were
sitting
there
were
six
of
them
there
and
i
knew
two
of
them
immediately
he
that
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
a
very
man
with
pointed
features
in
an
peruke
was
no
other
than
my
lord
shaftesbury
himself
and
the
one
on
his
left
with
a
highish
colour
in
his
cheeks
was
my
lord
grey
of
the
rest
i
knew
nothing
but
those
two
were
enough
to
shew
me
that
i
must
make
no
mistakes
there
were
candles
on
the
table
my
lord
essex
smiled
as
he
turned
to
me
mallock
he
said
i
see
you
know
some
of
these
gentlemen
by
sight
i
know
my
lord
shaftesbury
and
my
lord
grey
by
sight
i
said
bowing
to
each
they
each
inclined
a
little
in
return
and
this
is
west
said
my
lord
this
was
a
very
active
little
fellow
with
bright
dark
eyes
he
had
the
name
of
being
an
atheist
i
learned
afterwards
sit
down
mallock
said
my
lord
pointing
to
a
chair
on
my
lord
shaftesbury
right
i
did
so
there
was
no
servant
in
the
room
the
two
other
men
were
presently
made
known
to
me
as
a
sheppard
and
a
goodenough
i
knew
nothing
of
either
of
these
two
at
this
time
now
it
may
seem
that
it
was
extraordinary
bold
of
all
these
persons
to
admit
me
believing
as
they
did
that
i
was
on
his
majesty
side
and
would
reveal
all
to
him
and
it
was
in
one
way
bold
of
them
yet
it
was
the
more
clever
for
as
will
appear
they
said
nothing
to
me
at
present
that
could
be
taken
hold
of
in
any
way
and
yet
they
sent
or
rather
thought
they
sent
to
the
king
false
news
that
would
help
their
cause
when
he
had
discoursed
for
a
little
while
on
general
matters
yet
drawing
nearer
ever
to
the
point
my
lord
essex
opened
the
engagement
that
rumbald
he
said
do
you
know
who
he
is
mr
mallock
why
he
is
a
maltster
is
he
not
i
said
well
he
married
a
maltster
widow
who
is
dead
now
but
he
is
an
honest
old
cromwellian
loyal
enough
to
his
majesty
the
gentlemen
all
solemnly
put
hands
to
their
hats
yet
very
greatly
distressed
at
the
course
things
are
taking
an
old
soldier
i
asked
yes
he
was
a
colonel
under
oliver
such
was
the
opening
and
after
that
we
talked
more
freely
though
not
so
freely
as
i
doubt
not
they
had
talked
for
an
hour
before
i
came
my
lord
shaftesbury
did
not
say
a
great
deal
he
had
a
quick
discontented
look
but
i
think
i
satisfied
him
he
was
in
a
very
low
condition
at
this
time
all
but
desperate
so
strongly
had
the
tide
set
against
him
since
my
lord
stafford
death
and
the
reaction
that
followed
it
and
i
think
he
would
have
grasped
at
anything
to
further
his
fortunes
for
that
was
what
he
chiefly
cared
about
my
lord
essex
did
most
of
the
talking
and
west
and
i
could
see
that
they
were
shewing
me
off
as
a
new
capture
and
one
on
whose
treachery
to
them
their
hopes
might
turn
now
there
were
three
or
four
matters
on
which
they
were
very
emphatic
first
that
no
injury
was
intended
to
the
king
or
the
duke
of
york
but
this
they
did
not
disclaim
for
themselves
so
much
as
for
the
disaffected
persons
generally
as
regards
themselves
they
said
little
or
nothing
and
from
this
i
deduced
that
the
king
life
would
certainly
be
aimed
at
and
the
more
so
as
they
said
what
a
pity
it
was
that
his
guards
were
still
doubled
it
shews
a
lack
of
confidence
in
the
people
said
my
lord
essex
from
that
then
i
argued
that
an
attempt
was
contemplated
upon
whitehall
the
second
thing
that
west
was
very
emphatic
upon
was
the
need
of
proceeding
if
any
reform
were
to
be
brought
about
in
a
legal
and
parliamentary
manner
why
does
not
his
majesty
call
another
parliament
he
added
that
at
least
we
may
air
our
grievances
it
is
true
enough
that
my
lord
shaftesbury
here
he
bowed
to
my
lord
who
blinked
in
return
that
my
lord
shaftesbury
found
parliament
against
him
in
the
event
but
he
does
not
complain
of
that
he
hath
at
least
been
heard
from
that
i
argued
either
that
they
thought
they
would
be
stronger
in
a
new
parliament
or
that
they
contemplated
acting
in
quite
another
manner
i
could
not
tell
for
certain
which
but
i
supposed
the
latter
the
third
thing
that
goodenough
said
relating
how
he
had
heard
it
from
a
ferguson
of
bristol
was
that
the
west
of
england
was
in
a
very
discontented
condition
and
that
his
majesty
would
do
well
to
send
troops
there
now
i
knew
that
his
statement
was
tolerably
true
and
that
therefore
the
false
part
must
be
the
second
the
only
conclusion
i
could
draw
was
that
they
wished
troops
to
be
withdrawn
from
london
to
all
these
things
however
i
assented
civilly
arguing
a
little
for
form
sake
but
not
too
much
when
at
last
we
broke
up
my
lord
essex
again
came
with
me
to
the
door
and
carried
me
first
for
an
instant
into
the
little
parlour
mallock
he
said
we
have
had
a
pleasant
evening
have
we
not
but
i
need
not
tell
you
that
our
talk
had
best
not
be
repeated
we
have
said
not
a
word
that
is
disloyal
to
his
majesty
but
even
a
little
is
apt
to
be
misrepresented
in
these
days
i
said
that
i
understood
him
perfectly
which
indeed
i
did
and
nodded
very
sagely
let
us
meet
again
then
mallock
on
that
understanding
i
have
some
more
friends
i
would
wish
you
to
meet
and
whom
i
am
sure
you
could
do
good
to
there
is
a
quantity
of
discontent
about
i
went
to
see
chiffinch
the
next
day
and
reported
all
that
had
passed
as
they
had
intended
me
to
do
we
drew
up
a
little
report
which
was
carried
into
effect
first
that
no
troops
should
be
sent
out
of
london
but
that
they
should
be
dispersed
as
much
as
possible
within
the
confines
of
the
city
next
that
the
guards
at
the
gates
of
whitehall
should
be
diminished
by
one
half
this
to
give
colour
to
the
malcontents
hope
and
provoke
them
to
action
but
the
guards
within
increased
by
the
same
amount
yet
kept
out
of
sight
so
much
as
was
possible
thirdly
that
a
rumour
should
be
set
about
that
the
king
would
call
a
parliament
within
the
year
at
latest
and
this
chiffinch
promised
to
undertake
for
a
very
great
effect
indeed
can
be
produced
on
popular
opinion
by
those
who
know
the
value
of
false
rumours
but
that
his
majesty
should
be
dissuaded
from
doing
anything
of
the
kind
such
then
was
the
result
of
that
first
meeting
to
which
i
was
admitted
and
such
more
or
less
was
our
course
of
procedure
all
through
the
spring
and
summer
this
i
have
related
in
full
to
serve
as
an
example
of
our
method
because
since
it
was
the
first
i
remember
it
very
distinctly
in
this
manner
i
used
the
information
i
gained
for
the
king
benefit
and
at
the
same
time
the
conspirators
were
led
to
believe
that
i
was
their
tool
and
no
more
the
next
important
incident
fell
in
the
beginning
of
the
summer
now
in
the
meantime
i
had
learned
from
chiffinch
for
the
most
part
though
there
were
some
matters
i
was
able
rather
to
inform
him
about
that
there
were
two
separate
and
distinct
parties
amongst
the
conspirators
there
were
those
who
intended
nothing
but
some
kind
of
a
rising
scarcely
more
than
an
armed
demonstration
and
to
this
party
would
belong
such
a
man
as
my
lord
russell
if
he
were
of
them
at
all
and
there
were
those
who
meant
a
great
deal
more
than
this
who
were
hoping
in
fact
so
to
excite
their
followers
as
to
bring
about
the
king
death
but
of
these
i
found
it
very
hard
to
get
any
names
and
quite
impossible
so
far
to
obtain
any
positive
proof
at
all
the
duke
of
monmouth
i
knew
was
of
the
moderate
party
so
i
thought
then
was
my
lord
grey
but
algernon
sidney
whom
i
met
once
or
twice
was
of
the
extreme
side
but
as
to
my
lord
shaftesbury
i
knew
nothing
he
was
pretty
silent
always
and
it
was
with
regard
to
him
most
of
all
that
we
desired
evidence
it
was
this
division
of
parties
no
doubt
that
hindered
any
action
the
moderates
were
for
ever
trying
to
drag
back
the
fanatics
and
the
fanatics
to
urge
on
the
moderates
so
that
nothing
was
done
from
my
diaries
i
find
that
i
spoke
with
my
lord
essex
no
less
than
eight
times
between
christmas
and
july
i
saw
my
lord
russell
only
once
as
i
shall
relate
presently
but
did
not
speak
with
him
the
rest
i
met
now
and
again
but
never
all
of
them
together
it
was
necessary
no
doubt
that
they
should
be
well
drilled
before
they
could
be
trusted
with
me
rumbald
i
met
about
four
times
and
my
lord
howard
but
once
i
think
all
this
time
they
were
wholly
satisfied
that
i
passed
on
to
chiffinch
what
they
told
me
and
nothing
else
for
he
and
i
usually
contrived
to
carry
out
part
at
least
of
their
recommendations
i
first
began
to
learn
something
of
my
lord
russell
position
in
the
matter
in
a
meeting
in
july
in
the
house
of
the
sheppard
whom
i
had
met
at
west
that
was
situated
in
wapping
and
i
learned
something
else
too
at
the
same
time
my
lord
essex
came
for
me
in
his
coach
that
day
and
himself
carried
me
down
i
need
not
say
that
on
these
occasions
i
carried
always
some
pistol
or
other
weapon
with
me
beside
my
sword
for
i
never
knew
when
they
might
not
find
me
out
sheppard
house
was
in
a
little
street
that
was
a
between
the
garden
grounds
which
was
a
great
open
space
and
the
old
stairs
on
the
river
it
was
about
eight
and
was
beginning
to
be
twilight
when
we
came
as
we
descended
from
the
coach
i
noticed
at
a
little
distance
away
a
number
of
fellows
very
rough
looking
standing
together
watching
us
and
i
perceived
that
they
saluted
my
lord
who
returned
the
salute
very
heartily
i
did
not
much
like
that
who
were
these
folks
i
wondered
who
knew
my
lord
the
house
was
very
ordinary
within
it
was
flagged
with
stones
that
had
some
kind
of
matting
upon
them
the
entrance
was
all
panelled
and
what
surprised
me
was
that
no
servant
was
to
be
seen
sheppard
himself
opened
the
door
to
us
when
we
knocked
we
did
not
speak
at
all
as
we
came
in
and
my
lord
led
me
straight
through
into
the
parlour
on
the
left
that
was
full
of
this
was
a
very
good
room
hung
all
round
with
tapestry
though
of
a
poorish
quality
and
though
it
was
not
yet
dark
the
windows
were
shuttered
and
barred
at
the
table
sat
half
a
dozen
persons
of
whom
i
knew
my
lord
shaftesbury
at
the
head
of
the
table
as
usual
and
goodenough
that
sat
with
his
back
to
the
hearth
between
these
two
sat
a
gentleman
whom
i
knew
to
be
my
lord
howard
of
escrick
though
i
had
never
spoken
with
him
he
carried
himself
with
a
very
high
air
and
was
the
only
man
there
dressed
as
if
he
were
still
in
westminster
the
rest
were
subdued
somewhat
in
their
appearance
my
lord
howard
looked
at
me
with
an
intolerant
kind
of
disdain
which
my
lord
essex
made
haste
to
cover
by
directing
me
to
my
place
i
thought
that
my
lord
shaftesbury
seemed
very
heavy
this
evening
he
treated
me
with
a
silent
kind
of
civility
and
so
too
did
he
treat
the
rest
his
eyes
wandered
away
sometimes
as
we
talked
as
if
he
were
thinking
of
something
else
we
spoke
of
nothing
of
any
importance
for
a
time
for
sheppard
was
bringing
in
wine
with
his
own
hands
though
i
saw
a
number
of
used
glasses
on
the
press
which
shewed
me
that
the
company
had
been
here
some
time
already
it
would
be
not
until
after
ten
or
twelve
minutes
that
sheppard
was
deputed
to
open
the
affair
on
account
of
which
i
had
been
sent
for
now
then
sheppard
said
my
lord
essex
who
sat
on
my
right
tell
us
the
news
sheppard
pushed
his
glass
forward
and
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
table
i
could
see
that
all
that
he
said
was
directed
principally
at
me
well
my
lords
he
said
i
have
very
good
news
you
remember
how
i
told
you
that
i
was
beginning
to
fear
for
the
people
down
here
that
they
would
be
provoked
soon
into
some
kind
of
a
rising
they
are
still
not
wholly
pacified
here
he
shot
a
look
at
me
which
he
should
not
have
done
but
i
am
doing
my
best
to
tell
them
that
we
have
very
good
hopes
indeed
that
his
majesty
will
be
persuaded
to
call
a
parliament
and
i
think
they
are
beginning
to
believe
me
i
think
we
may
say
that
the
danger
is
past
why
what
danger
is
that
mr
sheppard
said
i
very
innocently
why
a
rising
he
said
has
not
my
lord
essex
told
you
ah
yes
said
i
i
had
forgot
this
was
wholly
false
he
had
told
me
once
or
twice
at
least
that
there
was
danger
of
this
this
had
been
a
month
ago
and
his
object
had
been
to
persuade
me
that
they
had
been
telling
the
truth
i
saw
some
fellows
as
we
came
in
i
said
those
are
the
malcontents
he
said
there
are
not
more
than
a
very
few
now
who
go
about
and
brag
i
assented
by
the
way
said
my
lord
essex
to
shaftesbury
who
looked
at
him
heavily
i
spoke
with
my
lord
russell
a
week
ago
you
know
my
lord
russell
mr
mallock
i
said
that
i
did
not
well
i
had
hoped
he
would
have
been
here
but
he
is
gone
down
to
the
country
to
stratton
where
he
has
his
seat
he
talked
a
while
longer
of
my
lord
russell
and
i
saw
that
he
wished
me
to
believe
that
my
lord
was
of
their
party
whence
i
argued
to
myself
that
was
just
what
he
was
not
but
that
they
wished
to
win
him
over
for
the
sake
of
his
name
perhaps
and
his
known
probity
and
as
the
event
shewed
i
was
right
in
that
conjecture
two
or
three
of
them
were
still
talking
together
in
this
strain
and
while
i
listened
enough
to
tell
me
that
it
was
nothing
very
important
that
they
said
i
was
observing
my
lord
shaftesbury
and
upon
my
heart
i
was
sorry
for
the
man
three
years
ago
he
was
in
the
front
of
the
rising
tide
in
the
full
blast
of
popularity
and
power
he
had
so
worked
upon
the
old
popish
plot
and
the
mob
that
he
had
all
the
movement
with
him
his
majesty
himself
was
afraid
of
him
and
was
forced
to
follow
his
leading
now
he
was
fallen
from
all
this
the
had
triumphed
because
he
had
so
overshot
his
mark
and
here
was
he
in
this
poor
quarter
in
the
house
of
a
man
that
would
have
been
nothing
to
him
five
years
ago
forced
to
this
very
poor
kind
of
conspiring
for
his
last
hopes
he
sat
as
if
he
knew
all
this
himself
his
eyes
strayed
about
him
as
we
talked
and
there
were
heavy
pouches
beneath
them
and
deep
lines
at
the
corner
of
his
nose
and
mouth
it
was
this
man
thought
i
who
was
so
largely
responsible
for
the
death
of
so
many
innocents
and
all
for
his
own
ambition
presently
i
heard
his
grace
of
monmouth
spoken
of
it
was
sheppard
who
spoke
the
name
and
in
an
instant
i
was
on
the
alert
again
what
he
said
fell
very
pat
with
what
i
was
thinking
of
my
lord
shaftesbury
i
declare
cried
sheppard
once
more
talking
at
me
very
evidently
that
his
grace
of
monmouth
breaks
my
heart
i
was
with
his
grace
a
fortnight
ago
his
loyalty
and
love
for
the
king
are
overpowering
i
had
heard
this
was
a
very
bold
stroke
of
poor
sheppard
i
had
heard
that
some
villainous
fellows
had
proposed
to
his
grace
oh
a
great
while
ago
in
april
i
think
that
an
assault
should
be
made
upon
the
king
and
that
his
grace
near
killed
one
of
them
for
it
yet
his
majesty
will
scarce
speak
to
him
so
much
he
distrusts
him
this
was
all
very
pretty
and
from
it
i
argued
that
the
duke
was
deeper
in
the
affair
than
we
had
thought
and
perhaps
belonged
even
to
the
extremest
party
led
we
supposed
chiefly
by
sidney
but
i
murmured
that
it
was
a
shame
that
his
majesty
treated
him
so
and
while
i
was
listening
to
further
eulogies
on
his
grace
a
new
thought
came
to
me
which
i
determined
to
put
into
execution
that
very
night
for
i
felt
we
were
not
making
any
progress
there
was
not
much
more
conversation
of
any
significance
and
i
was
soon
able
to
carry
out
what
i
determined
for
my
lord
essex
when
we
broke
about
nine
again
offered
to
take
me
home
i
said
very
respectfully
to
the
company
and
followed
him
into
the
coach
for
a
while
i
said
nothing
but
appeared
preoccupied
so
that
at
last
my
lord
clapped
me
on
the
knee
and
asked
me
if
i
ailed
which
was
what
i
wished
him
to
do
my
lord
said
i
with
an
appearance
of
great
openness
i
have
a
confession
to
make
well
said
he
what
is
it
i
am
disappointed
i
said
there
is
a
deal
of
talk
and
most
interesting
talk
and
all
very
loyal
and
respectful
but
i
had
fancied
there
was
more
behind
what
do
you
mean
asked
he
well
i
said
if
his
grace
of
monmouth
will
do
nothing
will
none
of
his
friends
do
it
for
him
of
what
nature
asked
my
lord
my
lord
said
i
need
i
say
more
he
was
silent
for
a
while
and
i
could
see
how
his
mind
was
a
trifle
bewildered
but
he
did
presently
exactly
what
i
hoped
he
would
do
mallock
he
said
you
are
right
there
is
more
behind
and
i
promise
you
you
shall
hear
of
it
when
the
time
comes
is
that
enough
that
is
enough
my
lord
said
i
i
am
content
i
was
with
chiffinch
before
the
gates
were
shut
for
the
night
and
this
was
the
report
i
gave
him
i
have
learned
three
things
at
least
i
said
when
he
had
bolted
the
door
and
drawn
the
hanging
across
it
first
that
they
are
contemplating
a
rising
as
soon
as
they
can
get
their
men
together
and
that
it
will
be
from
wapping
and
thereabouts
that
the
insurrectionists
will
come
next
that
his
grace
of
monmouth
is
more
deeply
involved
than
we
had
thought
and
the
third
thing
is
that
i
have
persuaded
my
lord
essex
that
i
can
be
trusted
to
be
a
good
traitor
and
to
report
everything
but
that
if
they
do
not
commit
more
important
falsehoods
to
me
i
shall
lose
heart
with
them
we
may
expect
then
that
after
a
little
while
i
shall
have
more
vital
and
significant
lies
told
me
whence
we
can
arrive
at
the
truth
is
that
everything
said
he
ah
there
is
one
thing
more
they
are
trying
to
entangle
my
lord
russell
and
they
think
that
they
will
succeed
and
so
do
i
but
at
present
he
will
not
be
caught
chapter
viii
we
are
drawing
nearer
now
to
the
heart
of
the
conspiracy
that
was
forming
little
by
little
as
an
abscess
forms
in
the
body
of
a
sick
man
for
two
months
more
no
great
move
was
made
i
was
summoned
now
and
again
to
such
meetings
as
those
which
i
have
described
and
sometimes
one
man
was
there
and
sometimes
another
they
were
becoming
less
cautious
with
me
in
this
since
i
had
by
now
the
names
of
nearly
all
the
londoners
involved
and
chiffinch
had
the
names
of
the
principal
men
in
scotland
and
the
provinces
especially
in
the
west
with
whom
they
were
concerting
they
still
fed
me
with
lies
from
time
to
time
in
small
points
and
i
gained
a
little
knowledge
from
these
as
to
what
they
wished
me
to
believe
and
hence
as
to
what
was
indeed
the
truth
it
was
in
october
that
the
next
meeting
of
importance
took
place
the
next
that
is
to
say
to
which
i
myself
was
admitted
and
it
was
again
in
sheppard
house
in
wapping
there
were
gathered
there
for
the
first
time
mostly
all
the
principal
gentlemen
in
the
affair
and
this
was
one
more
sign
of
how
reckless
they
were
becoming
that
i
was
admitted
there
at
all
but
i
think
it
was
because
chiffinch
and
i
had
been
very
discreet
and
careful
that
they
thought
that
they
had
me
in
hand
and
that
i
was
somewhat
of
an
innocent
fool
and
revealed
no
more
than
what
they
wished
before
i
went
there
for
i
went
by
water
this
time
in
a
private
wherry
to
wapping
old
stairs
i
went
first
to
chiffinch
to
see
if
there
were
any
news
for
me
why
yes
he
said
when
he
had
me
alone
there
is
a
little
matter
i
would
like
you
to
find
out
about
the
duke
of
monmouth
was
here
with
my
lord
grey
a
day
or
two
ago
they
all
dined
with
sir
thomas
armstrong
and
all
three
of
them
went
round
the
posts
and
the
guardroom
and
saw
everything
now
what
was
that
for
sir
thomas
armstrong
said
i
in
astonishment
why
he
is
i
was
about
to
say
he
was
one
of
his
majesty
closest
friends
and
evil
geniuses
but
i
stopped
there
was
no
need
the
page
smiled
yes
he
said
well
mallock
if
you
can
find
out
anything
and
the
duke
too
i
said
well
i
was
right
was
i
not
for
what
i
had
found
out
was
true
enough
that
his
grace
was
far
more
deeply
involved
than
we
had
at
first
suspected
we
had
known
that
he
was
their
but
not
that
he
was
so
much
in
their
counsel
and
of
one
mind
with
them
his
grace
will
come
to
some
disaster
i
think
said
chiffinch
very
tranquilly
when
i
came
to
wapping
old
stairs
it
appeared
that
the
watermen
there
knew
well
enough
what
was
forward
for
while
one
ran
down
to
help
me
from
the
wherry
a
number
of
others
stood
watching
as
if
they
knew
what
i
had
come
for
and
all
saluted
me
as
i
went
up
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
i
looked
back
and
two
more
wherries
with
a
gentleman
in
each
were
just
coming
in
sheppard
himself
opened
the
door
to
me
and
appeared
a
little
confused
looking
over
his
shoulder
into
the
where
two
or
three
gentlemen
were
just
going
into
the
great
parlour
on
the
left
i
could
have
sworn
that
one
of
them
was
the
duke
from
the
way
he
carried
himself
with
him
was
another
whom
i
thought
i
knew
but
he
was
not
familiar
to
me
i
appeared
to
notice
nothing
but
beat
off
the
mud
from
my
boots
mallock
said
sheppard
they
are
not
yet
all
come
and
two
or
three
who
are
here
have
a
little
private
business
on
another
matter
first
will
you
wait
a
little
in
another
room
i
assented
immediately
and
he
took
me
through
the
hall
into
another
little
parlour
behind
that
in
which
the
company
was
assembled
it
will
not
be
more
than
ten
minutes
he
said
i
will
come
for
you
myself
when
they
are
done
when
he
was
gone
again
i
observed
the
room
it
had
but
one
window
which
was
shuttered
but
it
had
two
doors
the
one
by
which
i
was
come
in
and
another
beyond
the
hearth
leading
to
the
great
parlour
this
door
was
closed
now
it
was
of
the
greatest
importance
that
i
should
hear
what
was
passing
in
the
next
room
i
should
learn
more
in
five
words
spoken
there
then
than
in
five
hours
when
they
were
playing
a
part
to
me
and
i
had
no
scruple
whatever
considering
what
they
were
at
and
how
they
were
using
me
in
learning
by
any
means
that
were
in
my
power
what
i
wished
to
know
even
from
where
i
stood
i
could
hear
the
murmur
of
talk
and
it
was
probable
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
i
laid
my
ear
on
the
panel
of
the
door
i
should
hear
every
word
of
it
but
first
i
pulled
out
a
chair
and
set
it
by
the
table
with
my
hat
and
cane
beside
it
then
i
went
to
the
door
into
the
hall
which
opened
fortunately
with
its
hinge
nearer
to
the
hearth
so
that
a
man
entering
would
not
see
immediately
into
that
part
of
the
room
in
which
i
should
be
and
beneath
the
door
i
slipped
a
little
sliver
of
wood
from
the
by
the
hearth
so
that
the
door
would
stick
a
little
having
done
that
i
went
on
to
the
other
door
and
put
my
ear
to
the
panel
but
i
feared
they
would
not
say
anything
very
significant
with
me
so
close
now
it
was
a
little
while
before
i
could
distinguish
which
voice
belonged
to
what
man
i
got
the
duke
at
once
there
was
a
lordly
kind
of
ring
in
it
that
could
never
be
forgotten
and
i
got
presently
my
lord
grey
voice
and
then
one
with
a
drawl
in
it
which
i
had
never
heard
before
and
then
one
that
had
no
special
characteristic
but
was
a
little
slow
these
were
the
four
whom
i
heard
speak
besides
sheppard
once
the
conversation
i
heard
was
somewhat
as
follows
i
set
it
all
down
on
my
way
home
the
duke
said
i
am
very
pleased
indeed
that
you
are
come
after
all
my
lord
we
understand
by
that
you
have
put
aside
all
suspicions
and
that
is
an
encouragement
the
slow
voice
said
i
would
do
anything
in
my
power
your
grace
which
was
not
against
my
conscience
to
help
on
that
cause
of
which
you
have
spoken
but
i
must
confess
my
lord
grey
said
sharply
there
there
we
understand
and
are
very
glad
of
it
the
thing
can
be
arranged
without
any
treason
at
all
or
any
injury
to
a
soul
it
is
merely
a
demonstration
no
more
upon
my
honour
the
drawling
voice
said
no
more
will
be
needed
his
grace
and
we
two
went
round
everywhere
they
are
not
like
soldiers
at
all
they
are
remiss
in
everything
the
duke
said
you
see
my
lord
it
is
exactly
as
i
said
god
knows
we
would
not
injure
a
soul
i
well
know
your
lordship
high
principles
the
slow
voice
said
well
your
grace
so
long
as
that
is
understood
i
shall
be
very
happy
to
hear
what
the
design
may
be
sheppard
said
one
instant
my
lord
then
he
dropped
his
voice
and
i
saw
what
he
was
at
i
slipped
back
as
quick
as
i
could
drew
out
the
sliver
of
wood
from
beneath
the
other
door
and
sat
down
then
i
heard
his
footstep
outside
when
he
came
in
i
was
in
the
chair
but
i
rose
i
beg
pardon
for
keeping
you
sir
he
said
there
is
just
that
trifle
of
business
and
no
more
i
am
come
to
keep
you
company
well
i
resigned
myself
to
it
with
a
good
air
and
we
sat
and
talked
there
of
indifferent
matters
or
very
nearly
for
at
least
half
an
hour
longer
it
was
highly
provoking
to
me
but
it
could
not
be
helped
that
i
should
sit
there
with
an
affair
of
real
importance
proceeding
in
the
next
room
and
i
placed
so
favourably
for
the
hearing
of
it
however
i
had
gained
something
though
at
present
i
did
not
know
how
much
suddenly
sheppard
stood
up
and
i
heard
a
door
open
and
voices
in
the
entrance
hall
you
will
excuse
me
sir
an
instant
he
said
i
must
see
these
gentlemen
out
i
bowed
to
him
as
i
stood
up
and
put
myself
in
such
a
position
that
i
could
get
a
good
look
into
the
hall
as
he
went
out
and
fortune
favoured
me
for
there
in
the
light
of
the
pair
of
candles
outside
i
caught
a
plain
sight
of
the
plump
and
rather
solemn
face
of
my
lord
russell
it
was
only
for
an
instant
but
that
was
enough
and
at
the
same
time
i
heard
the
drawling
voice
of
someone
out
of
sight
bidding
to
others
within
the
parlour
then
sheppard
shut
the
door
behind
him
and
i
sat
down
again
well
i
had
gained
something
and
i
was
beginning
to
repeat
to
myself
what
i
had
heard
for
that
is
the
best
way
of
all
to
imprint
it
on
the
memory
when
sheppard
came
in
again
and
invited
me
to
follow
him
who
was
that
that
spoke
i
said
carelessly
as
you
went
out
just
now
i
can
swear
i
know
the
voice
he
glanced
sharply
at
me
that
he
said
oh
that
must
have
been
sir
thomas
armstrong
who
is
just
gone
out
the
parlour
had
no
more
than
five
men
in
it
when
we
entered
and
one
seemed
about
to
take
his
leave
that
one
was
his
grace
of
monmouth
i
was
a
little
astonished
that
they
let
me
see
him
there
though
i
understood
presently
why
it
was
so
he
turned
to
me
very
friendly
while
i
was
observing
the
two
others
i
did
not
know
one
of
whom
ferguson
was
dressed
as
a
minister
why
mallock
he
said
you
come
as
i
go
he
recognized
me
a
shade
too
swiftly
that
shewed
me
that
they
had
been
speaking
of
me
to
him
i
said
something
civil
and
then
i
saw
that
he
was
to
say
the
piece
they
had
just
taught
him
for
that
he
was
not
sharp
enough
to
be
trusted
long
in
the
room
with
me
i
hear
you
are
all
consulting
said
he
how
to
keep
the
peace
well
i
have
given
my
counsel
and
my
lord
essex
here
knows
what
i
wish
i
would
i
could
stay
gentlemen
but
that
can
not
be
done
there
was
a
loyal
and
grateful
murmur
from
the
others
indeed
he
looked
a
prince
every
inch
of
him
he
took
his
leave
with
a
superb
courtesy
giving
his
hand
to
each
and
each
bowed
over
it
very
low
i
was
not
sure
but
that
sheppard
did
not
kiss
it
for
myself
i
kissed
it
outright
while
i
did
so
i
could
have
sworn
that
sheppard
said
something
very
swiftly
in
the
ear
of
my
lord
essex
now
i
was
wondering
why
they
had
kept
me
from
my
lord
russell
his
probity
was
known
well
enough
and
if
they
had
wished
to
reassure
me
they
could
have
done
no
better
than
tell
me
he
was
one
of
them
and
then
of
a
sudden
i
recollected
that
to
reassure
me
was
the
very
last
thing
they
wished
on
the
contrary
they
wished
to
hold
me
tight
betraying
only
what
they
wished
me
to
betray
until
they
were
ready
for
their
final
stroke
and
just
as
i
had
arrived
at
that
when
we
were
all
sat
down
my
lord
essex
again
dumfoundered
me
mallock
he
said
i
wish
to
tell
you
now
we
are
in
private
that
my
lord
russell
has
been
here
as
well
as
his
grace
and
sir
thomas
armstrong
you
can
tell
from
the
presence
of
those
three
what
our
chief
difficulty
will
be
for
not
one
of
them
will
hear
of
even
the
danger
of
any
injury
to
his
majesty
or
the
duke
of
york
his
grace
of
monmouth
of
course
had
to
be
consulted
on
one
or
two
points
and
he
brought
those
other
two
with
him
to
hear
what
we
had
to
say
well
i
think
we
have
satisfied
them
though
i
fear
later
that
they
will
not
approve
of
our
methods
but
we
did
not
wish
my
lord
russell
to
see
you
until
we
had
done
talking
to
him
for
fear
that
he
might
know
something
of
your
disaffection
we
have
satisfied
him
and
what
is
more
important
his
grace
too
for
the
present
and
they
will
not
interfere
with
us
now
this
speech
was
an
exceedingly
ingenious
one
before
he
had
done
speaking
i
understood
that
sheppard
had
suspected
that
i
had
seen
my
lord
russell
and
that
that
was
why
they
were
so
open
with
me
but
the
rest
of
the
speech
was
very
shrewd
indeed
and
i
think
it
might
have
deceived
me
if
i
had
not
learned
by
the
conversation
that
it
was
his
grace
who
was
trying
to
reassure
my
lord
and
no
one
that
was
trying
to
reassure
his
grace
but
the
web
was
so
well
woven
that
for
the
moment
i
could
not
see
through
it
all
though
i
understood
it
all
presently
when
i
had
had
a
little
time
to
think
for
the
instant
however
i
saw
one
safe
answer
that
i
could
make
i
am
obliged
to
your
lordship
for
telling
me
i
said
and
i
trust
from
what
you
have
said
that
it
is
but
a
preliminary
to
a
little
more
information
your
lordship
told
me
in
july
that
there
would
be
more
news
for
me
presently
he
could
not
resist
a
glance
at
my
lord
grey
as
if
in
triumph
at
his
success
that
is
what
we
are
met
for
he
said
and
then
why
mallock
i
have
not
made
these
other
gentlemen
known
to
you
they
turned
out
to
be
on
the
right
of
my
lord
the
minister
ferguson
he
who
had
been
spoken
of
before
as
an
informant
from
bristol
and
a
colonel
rumsey
an
old
cromwellian
like
the
maltster
of
hoddesdon
who
sat
next
to
ferguson
we
saluted
one
another
and
then
the
affair
began
mallock
said
my
lord
the
first
piece
of
news
is
a
little
disappointing
it
is
that
my
lord
shaftesbury
is
ill
it
is
not
at
all
grave
but
he
is
confined
to
his
bed
and
that
throws
back
some
of
our
designs
i
made
a
proper
answer
of
regret
and
considered
what
was
likely
to
be
the
truth
at
the
moment
i
could
not
see
what
this
would
be
the
next
piece
of
news
i
have
gentlemen
went
on
my
lord
for
i
think
he
thought
he
appeared
to
be
speaking
too
much
at
me
is
that
owing
to
my
lord
shaftesbury
illness
we
must
relinquish
all
thoughts
of
any
demonstration
in
london
that
mallock
was
what
we
had
hoped
to
be
able
to
do
in
a
week
or
two
from
now
well
that
is
impossible
for
the
rest
ferguson
had
better
tell
us
this
gentleman
i
took
to
be
somewhat
of
an
ass
by
his
appearance
and
manner
but
i
am
not
sure
he
was
not
the
cleverest
liar
of
them
all
he
spoke
with
a
strong
scotch
accent
and
an
appearance
of
shy
sheepiness
and
therefore
with
an
air
too
of
extraordinary
truth
he
spoke
too
at
great
length
as
if
he
were
in
his
pulpit
and
my
lord
essex
yawned
behind
his
hand
once
or
twice
briefly
put
ferguson
report
was
as
follows
the
discontent
in
the
west
was
rising
to
a
climax
and
if
a
much
longer
delay
were
made
real
danger
might
follow
it
was
sadly
disconcerting
therefore
to
him
to
hear
that
there
was
any
hitch
in
the
london
designs
for
the
promise
that
he
had
given
to
some
of
the
leaders
in
the
west
whose
names
he
said
with
an
appearance
of
a
stupid
boorish
kind
of
cunning
had
best
not
be
said
even
here
was
that
a
demonstration
should
be
made
simultaneously
both
here
in
the
west
and
in
scot
here
he
interrupted
himself
sharply
and
i
saw
that
he
had
made
a
blunder
but
he
covered
it
so
admirably
that
if
i
had
not
previously
known
that
discontent
was
seething
among
the
covenanters
i
am
sure
i
should
have
suspected
nothing
in
scotland
said
he
we
must
look
for
nothing
they
are
forever
promising
and
not
performing
though
i
say
it
of
my
own
countrymen
any
demonstration
there
would
surely
be
a
failure
it
was
admirably
done
and
it
was
then
that
i
perceived
what
an
actor
the
man
was
well
when
he
had
done
we
talked
over
it
a
while
i
professed
myself
very
well
satisfied
with
what
i
had
heard
and
i
put
forward
an
opinion
that
it
would
be
far
better
to
delay
no
longer
in
the
west
a
demonstration
there
might
lead
to
alarm
here
troops
might
be
withdrawn
here
and
relieve
the
pressure
and
thus
make
possible
a
further
demonstration
in
london
i
spoke
i
think
with
some
eloquence
remembering
however
that
they
all
looked
on
me
with
the
same
confidence
that
i
had
in
them
and
no
more
that
is
that
they
believed
me
a
liar
my
observations
were
received
with
applause
very
well
delivered
it
was
growing
pretty
late
by
the
time
we
had
done
yet
before
we
went
i
had
learned
one
more
piece
of
news
partly
through
a
little
trap
i
laid
and
partly
through
my
lord
essex
clumsiness
well
said
i
i
must
be
getting
homewards
my
lords
i
wish
my
lord
shaftesbury
had
been
here
could
i
see
his
lordship
do
you
think
if
i
were
to
call
at
his
town
house
there
is
a
very
particular
matter
my
lord
essex
started
a
little
he
was
tired
and
overanxious
i
think
with
the
continual
part
that
he
had
to
play
before
me
yet
it
was
the
first
slip
he
made
my
lord
is
out
of
town
he
said
then
he
paused
you
could
not
tell
us
i
suppose
i
affected
indifference
was
my
lord
out
of
town
i
wondered
why
it
is
nothing
i
said
my
lord
exchanged
a
look
with
sheppard
and
made
his
second
mistake
i
saw
my
lord
only
last
week
he
said
suddenly
he
wishes
his
address
to
be
private
for
the
present
but
do
not
trouble
yourself
my
lord
i
said
i
assure
you
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
our
business
here
i
repeated
this
i
think
with
a
good
enough
manner
to
persuade
them
that
what
i
said
was
true
and
presently
afterwards
took
my
leave
as
i
sat
in
the
wherry
that
took
me
back
to
the
privy
stairs
i
had
announced
of
course
to
the
temple
i
was
preparing
in
my
mind
what
i
should
say
i
had
learned
a
considerable
amount
for
an
evening
for
the
conversation
i
had
overheard
added
to
what
chiffinch
had
told
me
added
to
what
they
had
all
said
in
the
parlour
interpreted
and
fitted
together
was
pretty
significant
these
were
the
points
i
arranged
first
that
the
visit
of
the
duke
my
lord
grey
and
sir
thomas
armstrong
to
whitehall
was
to
see
in
what
state
the
guards
were
in
case
of
a
surprise
and
the
conclusion
they
had
arrived
at
was
they
were
not
like
soldiers
at
all
but
very
remiss
second
that
a
demonstration
in
london
was
very
imminent
third
that
they
had
won
over
my
lord
russell
enough
at
least
to
gain
the
help
that
his
name
would
give
fourth
i
was
confirmed
in
what
chiffinch
had
told
me
as
to
the
probability
of
a
rising
in
scotland
fifth
i
was
confirmed
in
my
view
that
the
duke
was
very
deeply
involved
sixth
it
appeared
to
me
exceedingly
probable
that
my
lord
shaftesbury
was
still
in
town
though
not
in
his
own
house
and
all
things
considered
it
was
very
nearly
certain
that
he
was
hidden
in
wapping
he
was
probably
also
a
little
ill
or
he
would
have
been
at
our
meeting
one
conclusion
then
immediate
and
pressing
came
out
of
all
this
that
an
assault
on
whitehall
and
an
attack
on
the
king
person
was
in
urgent
contemplation
then
as
we
went
up
under
the
stars
my
waterman
and
i
one
of
those
moods
came
upon
me
which
come
on
all
men
in
such
stress
as
i
was
and
i
appeared
to
myself
for
the
time
to
be
worlds
away
from
all
this
sedition
and
passion
and
fever
the
little
affairs
of
men
which
they
thought
so
great
seemed
to
me
in
that
hour
very
little
and
wicked
like
the
scheming
of
naughty
children
or
the
quarrels
and
spites
of
efts
in
a
muddy
pond
in
that
hour
my
whole
heart
grew
sick
at
this
miserable
murderous
pother
in
the
midst
of
which
my
duty
seemed
to
lie
and
yearned
instead
to
those
things
that
are
great
indeed
the
love
of
the
maid
who
had
promised
herself
to
me
and
the
love
of
god
that
should
make
us
one
my
religion
though
i
am
a
little
ashamed
to
confess
it
had
been
very
little
to
me
lately
i
had
heard
mass
indeed
usually
on
sundays
in
one
of
the
privileged
chapels
and
had
confessed
myself
at
easter
and
once
since
to
one
of
the
capuchins
and
received
communion
yet
for
the
rest
it
had
largely
been
blotted
out
by
these
hot
absorbing
affairs
in
which
i
found
myself
but
in
that
hour
for
the
tide
was
beginning
to
set
against
us
it
came
back
on
me
like
a
breeze
in
a
stifling
room
i
thought
of
that
cleanly
passionless
life
i
had
led
as
a
novice
and
of
that
no
less
cleanly
though
perhaps
less
supernatural
life
that
should
one
day
be
mine
and
dolly
and
these
politics
and
these
plottings
and
this
listening
at
doors
and
this
elaborate
lying
all
blew
off
from
me
like
a
cloud
when
we
were
yet
twenty
yards
from
the
privy
stairs
a
wherry
shot
past
us
with
no
light
burning
there
was
but
one
passenger
in
it
whom
i
knew
well
enough
though
i
feigned
to
see
nothing
and
once
more
my
sickness
came
on
me
that
it
was
for
a
king
like
this
slipping
out
on
some
shameful
pleasure
that
i
so
toiled
and
endangered
myself
when
i
had
reported
all
to
chiffinch
sitting
back
weary
in
my
chair
yet
knowing
that
i
must
go
through
with
the
work
to
which
i
had
set
my
hand
he
remained
silent
well
i
said
am
i
wrong
in
any
point
why
no
he
said
your
information
tallies
perfectly
with
all
i
know
and
has
increased
the
sum
very
much
for
example
i
had
no
idea
where
my
lord
shaftesbury
was
i
have
no
doubt
whatever
from
what
you
say
that
he
is
in
wapping
will
you
send
and
take
him
there
i
asked
no
he
said
shortly
leave
him
alone
we
failed
last
time
we
took
him
and
he
can
do
no
great
harm
there
plainly
too
he
is
at
the
waterside
that
he
may
escape
if
there
is
need
i
shall
set
spies
there
and
no
more
what
is
to
be
done
then
double
the
guards
again
why
that
of
course
said
he
and
what
else
i
asked
for
i
could
see
that
he
had
not
said
all
a
counterstroke
he
said
but
of
what
kind
you
say
the
rising
will
be
pretty
soon
i
do
not
suppose
for
a
week
or
two
at
the
most
they
were
decided
i
am
sure
but
no
more
suddenly
the
man
slapped
his
leg
and
his
eyes
grew
little
with
his
smile
i
have
it
for
sure
he
said
it
will
be
for
the
seventeenth
of
november
that
is
the
popular
date
queen
bess
and
dangerfield
and
the
rest
but
what
can
you
do
why
said
he
forbid
by
proclamation
all
processions
or
bonfires
on
that
day
then
they
can
not
even
begin
to
gather
he
proved
right
in
every
particular
the
proclamation
was
issued
and
met
their
intended
assault
to
the
very
moment
as
we
learned
afterwards
besides
frightening
the
leaders
lest
their
intention
had
been
discovered
and
the
next
night
came
one
of
the
spies
whom
chiffinch
had
sent
down
to
wapping
to
say
that
my
lord
shaftesbury
had
slipped
away
and
taken
boat
for
holland
chapter
ix
now
indeed
the
fear
grew
imminent
i
had
thought
that
once
my
lord
shaftesbury
was
gone
abroad
one
of
two
things
would
happen
either
that
the
whole
movement
would
collapse
or
that
the
leaders
would
be
arrested
forthwith
but
chiffinch
was
sharper
than
i
this
time
and
said
no
to
both
no
said
he
sitting
like
a
judge
with
his
fingers
together
on
the
morning
after
my
lord
shaftesbury
evasion
the
feeling
is
far
too
strong
to
fall
away
all
of
a
sudden
i
dare
predict
just
the
contrary
that
now
that
the
coolest
of
them
all
is
gone
for
he
dare
not
come
back
again
the
will
take
the
lead
and
that
means
the
sharpest
peril
we
have
yet
encountered
this
time
they
will
not
stop
at
a
demonstration
indeed
i
doubt
if
they
could
raise
one
successfully
they
will
aim
direct
at
the
person
of
the
king
it
is
their
only
hope
left
then
why
not
take
them
before
they
can
do
any
mischief
i
asked
first
mallock
he
said
because
we
have
not
enough
positive
evidence
at
any
rate
not
enough
to
hang
them
all
and
next
we
must
catch
the
small
fry
the
desperate
little
ones
who
will
themselves
attempt
the
killing
it
is
now
that
i
should
be
ready
for
a
visit
from
your
friend
rumbald
if
i
were
you
they
can
have
no
suspicion
that
you
have
done
anything
but
betray
them
in
the
way
they
intended
they
have
a
great
weapon
they
think
in
you
to
continue
carrying
false
news
now
mallock
is
the
very
time
come
of
which
you
once
spoke
to
me
the
climax
when
they
will
feign
to
reveal
everything
to
you
and
then
make
their
last
stroke
you
have
seen
my
lord
essex
again
not
a
sight
of
him
i
had
only
a
very
guarded
note
two
days
ago
but
very
friendly
saying
that
the
designs
were
fallen
through
for
the
present
precisely
what
i
have
been
saying
observed
chiffinch
no
mallock
you
must
not
stir
from
town
i
am
sorry
for
your
pretty
cousin
and
christmas
and
the
rest
but
you
see
for
yourself
that
we
must
leave
no
loophole
unguarded
his
majesty
must
not
die
out
of
his
bed
if
we
can
help
it
there
then
i
was
nailed
until
more
should
happen
i
dared
not
ask
my
cousins
to
come
to
town
for
god
only
knew
what
mischief
my
cousin
tom
might
not
play
and
i
had
not
eyes
on
both
sides
of
my
head
at
once
i
wrote
only
to
dolly
and
said
that
once
more
i
was
disappointed
but
that
i
would
most
certainly
see
her
soon
if
i
had
to
ride
two
nights
running
from
town
and
back
i
accomplished
this
but
not
until
christmas
was
well
over
and
indeed
lent
begun
during
those
weeks
certainly
nothing
of
any
importance
happened
to
me
though
my
lord
essex
kept
me
in
touch
with
him
and
i
even
was
present
at
one
very
dismal
meeting
with
him
and
ferguson
when
it
was
deplored
in
my
presence
that
the
demonstration
as
they
still
called
it
of
the
seventeenth
of
november
had
been
so
adroitly
prevented
and
my
lord
shaftesbury
death
which
had
taken
place
chiefly
i
think
from
disappointment
that
very
week
was
spoken
of
with
a
certain
relief
i
think
they
were
pleased
to
have
matters
entirely
in
their
own
hands
now
however
they
proposed
no
immediate
action
which
more
than
ever
persuaded
me
that
this
was
what
they
intended
yet
the
days
went
by
and
no
more
news
came
either
from
them
or
from
chiffinch
so
i
took
affairs
into
my
own
hands
and
one
night
before
the
gates
of
the
city
were
shut
went
down
to
hare
street
with
a
couple
of
men
leaving
james
at
home
for
i
could
trust
him
better
than
any
other
man
now
i
need
not
relate
all
that
passed
at
hare
street
for
every
lover
knows
how
sweet
was
that
day
to
me
i
had
seen
her
not
at
all
for
more
than
a
year
one
year
of
those
three
that
were
to
pass
and
though
we
had
written
often
to
one
another
whenever
we
could
get
a
letter
taken
yet
the
letters
had
done
no
more
than
increase
my
thirst
i
think
she
was
dearer
to
me
than
ever
she
was
a
shade
paler
and
more
grave
and
i
knew
what
it
was
that
had
made
her
so
for
i
had
told
her
very
plainly
indeed
that
i
was
in
peril
and
that
she
must
pray
much
for
me
my
cousin
tom
was
friendly
enough
though
i
saw
he
was
no
more
reconciled
in
his
heart
to
our
affair
than
he
had
been
at
the
beginning
but
i
guessed
nothing
whatever
of
what
he
was
contemplating
however
perhaps
he
was
not
contemplating
it
then
for
he
did
not
attempt
it
till
much
later
yet
he
was
pretty
reasonable
and
interrupted
us
no
more
than
was
necessary
so
we
had
that
day
to
ourselves
until
night
fell
and
i
must
ride
again
i
was
so
weary
that
night
though
refreshed
in
my
spirit
that
i
think
i
drowsed
a
little
on
my
horse
and
thought
that
i
stood
again
at
the
gate
of
the
yard
with
dolly
bareheaded
in
spite
of
the
cold
holding
the
lantern
to
help
us
to
mount
i
was
still
brooding
all
the
way
up
fleet
street
and
even
to
my
own
door
until
i
saw
james
standing
there
and
at
the
sight
of
him
i
knew
that
something
was
fallen
out
i
said
nothing
but
nodded
at
him
only
as
a
master
may
but
he
understood
that
he
was
to
follow
upstairs
there
in
my
chamber
i
faced
him
well
said
i
what
is
it
sir
he
said
a
fellow
came
last
night
and
seemed
much
put
out
when
i
told
him
you
were
out
of
town
what
sort
of
a
fellow
was
he
said
i
he
was
a
man
sir
rather
red
in
the
face
with
reddish
hair
turning
grey
on
his
temples
heavily
built
yes
sir
well
what
did
he
say
he
said
that
you
would
know
what
affair
he
was
come
about
that
it
was
very
urgent
and
that
he
could
not
stay
in
town
beyond
noon
he
said
sir
that
he
was
to
be
found
till
then
at
the
without
aldgate
well
that
was
enough
for
me
but
i
did
not
relish
the
prospect
of
no
sleep
again
for
i
can
not
trust
my
wits
when
i
have
not
slept
my
seven
or
eight
hours
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
james
said
i
bring
my
morning
up
here
at
once
with
some
meat
too
i
may
not
be
able
to
dine
or
not
till
late
when
you
have
brought
it
i
shall
have
a
letter
ready
for
chiffinch
that
you
must
take
yourself
then
return
here
and
pack
a
pair
of
valises
with
a
suit
in
them
for
yourself
have
two
horses
ready
at
eleven
you
must
come
with
me
and
no
one
else
i
do
not
know
how
long
we
may
be
away
you
understand
yes
sir
very
well
i
must
get
some
sleep
if
i
can
before
eleven
then
a
thought
came
to
me
if
rumbald
must
be
gone
from
town
by
noon
would
he
not
likely
want
me
to
go
with
him
wait
i
said
i
do
not
know
this
man
very
well
but
i
will
tell
you
that
his
name
is
rumbald
and
that
he
lives
at
the
rye
near
hoddesdon
you
had
best
not
come
with
me
but
do
all
else
as
i
have
said
but
you
must
ride
by
yourself
at
eleven
to
hoddesdon
and
put
up
at
the
inn
there
i
forget
its
name
but
the
largest
there
if
there
be
more
than
one
remain
there
until
you
hear
from
me
again
i
may
want
a
courier
do
not
go
a
hundred
yards
from
the
inn
on
any
account
and
do
not
seem
to
know
me
unless
i
speak
to
you
first
you
may
see
me
or
you
may
not
i
know
nothing
till
i
have
seen
rumbald
if
you
do
not
hear
of
me
before
ten
you
can
go
to
bed
and
return
here
in
the
morning
i
will
communicate
with
you
by
night
at
latest
if
i
do
not
go
to
chiffinch
yourself
and
tell
him
my
mind
was
working
at
that
swift
feverish
speed
which
weariness
sometimes
will
give
i
was
amazed
afterwards
at
my
own
foresight
for
there
was
very
little
evidence
of
what
was
intended
and
yet
there
had
come
upon
me
as
in
an
illumination
that
the
time
for
which
we
had
waited
so
long
was
arrived
at
last
i
do
not
see
how
i
could
have
guessed
more
than
i
did
neither
do
i
now
see
how
i
guessed
so
much
my
letter
to
chiffinch
was
not
long
it
ran
as
follows
rumbald
hath
been
to
see
me
and
bids
me
be
with
him
if
i
can
by
noon
at
the
without
aldgate
i
know
no
more
than
that
but
i
am
making
ready
to
go
down
with
him
to
the
rye
at
hoddesdon
if
he
should
want
me
there
i
think
that
something
is
intended
if
we
are
right
in
our
conjectures
i
shall
have
my
man
at
the
inn
in
hoddesdon
you
must
send
no
one
else
for
fear
of
alarming
them
unless
my
man
comes
to
you
to
tell
you
that
he
does
not
know
where
i
am
is
his
majesty
still
at
newmarket
if
so
when
does
he
purpose
to
return
which
road
will
he
come
by
send
an
answer
back
by
my
man
who
bears
this
well
that
was
all
that
i
could
do
i
gave
the
letter
to
james
telling
him
not
to
awaken
me
with
the
answer
till
he
came
at
eleven
and
after
eating
a
good
meal
i
went
to
my
bed
and
fell
sound
asleep
and
it
seemed
scarcely
five
minutes
before
james
came
knocking
with
chiffinch
answer
i
sat
up
on
my
bed
and
read
it
my
mind
still
swimming
with
sleep
it
ran
i
will
observe
all
that
you
say
the
king
and
his
royal
highness
are
together
at
newmarket
they
purpose
to
return
on
a
saturday
as
the
king
usually
does
but
he
hath
not
yet
sent
to
say
whether
it
will
be
the
or
the
i
shall
hear
by
night
no
doubt
neither
do
i
know
the
road
by
which
they
may
come
i
read
it
through
twice
then
i
tore
it
into
fragments
and
gave
them
to
james
burn
all
these
i
said
are
the
horses
ready
yes
sir
said
james
undoubtedly
my
sleep
had
refreshed
me
for
by
the
time
that
i
rode
up
to
the
without
aldgate
i
was
awake
with
a
kind
of
that
astonished
me
it
appeared
to
me
that
i
had
thought
out
every
contingency
i
had
with
me
a
little
valise
ready
for
the
country
if
need
be
yet
i
could
return
to
my
lodgings
without
remark
james
was
already
on
his
way
to
hoddesdon
and
would
be
there
if
i
needed
him
no
harm
was
done
if
my
conjectures
were
at
fault
i
had
left
no
loophole
that
i
could
see
if
they
were
not
it
was
with
a
tolerably
contented
heart
in
spite
of
the
dangers
i
foresaw
for
i
think
these
gave
spice
to
my
adventure
that
i
rode
up
to
the
and
saw
rumbald
himself
standing
astraddle
in
the
doorway
i
must
confess
however
that
the
sight
of
him
gave
me
a
little
check
he
appeared
to
me
more
truculent
than
i
had
ever
seen
him
he
had
his
hands
behind
him
with
a
great
whip
in
them
he
hardly
smiled
to
me
but
nodded
only
fixing
his
fierce
eyes
on
my
face
he
had
more
than
i
had
ever
noticed
it
before
that
hard
fanatic
look
of
the
puritan
after
all
i
reflected
this
maltster
had
commanded
a
troop
under
cromwell
at
naseby
his
manner
was
very
different
from
when
i
had
last
seen
him
he
appeared
to
me
as
if
desperate
however
i
think
i
shewed
nothing
of
what
i
felt
i
saluted
him
easily
and
swung
myself
off
my
horse
he
had
gone
into
the
house
at
my
approach
and
i
followed
him
straight
through
into
a
little
parlour
to
which
it
seemed
he
had
particular
access
for
he
turned
a
key
in
the
door
as
he
went
in
when
i
was
in
after
him
and
the
door
was
shut
he
turned
to
me
with
a
very
stern
look
well
mr
mallock
he
said
i
see
you
are
come
ready
for
a
ride
yes
i
said
i
had
your
message
he
nodded
then
he
came
a
little
closer
looking
at
me
with
his
fierce
eyes
you
understand
what
is
forward
i
understand
enough
said
i
that
is
very
good
then
we
will
ride
at
once
as
we
came
out
a
couple
of
men
one
of
them
i
noticed
in
particular
dressed
as
a
workman
i
set
him
down
for
a
carpenter
or
some
such
thing
made
as
though
they
would
speak
to
us
but
rumbald
waved
his
hand
at
them
sharply
as
if
to
hold
them
off
i
could
see
that
he
was
displeased
i
said
nothing
but
i
marked
the
man
closely
he
was
a
little
fellow
that
looked
rumbald
horse
was
already
there
and
mine
was
being
held
still
by
the
ostler
into
whose
hands
i
had
given
him
we
mounted
without
another
word
and
rode
away
i
think
we
did
not
speak
one
word
at
all
till
we
were
out
from
town
such
was
his
mood
and
such
therefore
i
imitated
he
rode
like
a
soldier
sitting
easily
and
squarely
in
his
saddle
and
the
more
i
observed
him
and
thought
of
him
the
less
i
liked
my
business
it
was
wonderful
how
some
emotion
had
driven
up
the
power
that
lay
in
him
all
that
genial
manner
was
gone
completely
when
we
were
clear
of
town
he
spoke
at
last
this
is
a
very
grave
business
sir
he
said
we
had
best
not
speak
of
it
till
we
are
home
have
you
no
servants
he
spoke
so
naturally
of
my
servants
that
i
saw
he
was
astonished
i
had
none
i
had
very
little
time
to
think
what
i
should
answer
it
appeared
to
me
that
i
had
best
be
open
yes
i
said
my
man
is
gone
on
to
hoddesdon
to
await
me
there
i
thought
it
was
best
he
should
not
ride
with
us
he
looked
at
me
with
a
peculiar
expression
that
i
could
not
understand
but
only
for
an
instant
then
he
nodded
and
turned
his
stern
face
again
over
his
horse
ears
my
moods
were
very
various
as
i
rode
on
now
i
felt
as
a
sheep
being
led
to
the
slaughter
now
as
an
adventurer
on
a
quest
and
again
of
a
sudden
there
would
sweep
over
me
a
great
anxiety
as
to
his
safety
the
thought
of
dolly
too
came
upon
me
continually
and
affected
me
now
in
this
way
now
in
that
now
i
longed
to
be
free
and
safe
back
at
hare
street
now
i
knew
that
i
could
never
look
her
in
the
face
again
if
i
evaded
my
plain
duty
one
thing
i
can
say
however
from
my
heart
and
that
is
that
never
for
an
instant
did
i
seriously
consider
any
evasion
it
was
all
in
the
course
that
i
had
chosen
to
serve
the
king
well
i
must
do
so
now
wherever
it
led
me
what
however
greatly
added
to
the
horror
of
my
position
was
that
i
knew
that
this
strong
fellow
at
my
side
thought
me
to
be
a
traitor
to
himself
and
was
using
that
knowledge
only
for
his
own
ends
he
would
surely
be
ruthless
if
he
found
i
had
served
my
turn
and
here
was
i
riding
to
his
house
and
only
two
men
in
the
world
knew
whither
i
was
gone
rumbald
had
already
dined
and
thought
not
at
all
of
me
we
drew
rein
therefore
nowhere
but
rode
straight
on
through
village
and
country
alike
now
ambling
for
a
little
once
or
twice
cantering
and
then
walking
again
when
the
way
had
holes
in
it
so
we
passed
through
totteridge
and
barnet
and
enfield
chase
and
wood
green
and
came
at
last
to
broxbourne
where
the
roads
forked
and
we
turned
down
to
the
right
it
was
terrible
that
ride
all
in
silence
once
or
twice
i
had
attempted
a
general
observation
but
he
answered
so
shortly
that
i
tried
no
more
and
i
am
not
ashamed
to
say
that
i
committed
myself
again
and
again
to
the
tuition
of
our
lady
of
good
counsel
whose
picture
i
had
venerated
in
rome
indeed
it
was
counsel
that
i
needed
i
did
not
know
precisely
where
was
the
rye
nor
what
it
was
like
for
i
had
avoided
the
place
of
design
i
supposed
it
only
a
little
place
perhaps
in
a
village
i
was
a
trifle
disconcerted
therefore
when
as
we
crossed
the
lea
by
a
wooden
bridge
he
pointed
with
his
whip
in
silence
to
a
very
house
that
even
had
battlemented
roofs
not
two
hundred
yards
away
to
the
left
of
the
road
there
was
no
other
building
that
i
could
see
except
the
roofs
of
an
outhouse
or
two
and
suchlike
however
i
nodded
and
said
nothing
no
words
were
best
in
silence
we
rode
on
over
the
bridge
and
beyond
and
in
silence
we
turned
in
through
a
gateway
and
up
to
the
house
crossing
a
moat
as
we
went
indeed
now
i
was
astonished
more
than
ever
at
the
house
it
was
liker
a
castle
there
was
an
arched
entrance
very
solid
all
of
brick
with
the
teeth
even
of
a
portcullis
shewing
an
old
man
came
out
of
a
door
on
our
right
as
our
hoofs
rang
out
but
he
made
no
sign
or
salute
he
took
our
horses
heads
as
we
dismounted
and
i
heard
him
presently
leading
them
away
still
without
speaking
the
colonel
led
me
through
the
little
on
the
right
hung
round
with
old
weapons
of
the
civil
war
and
up
a
staircase
at
the
further
end
at
the
head
of
the
staircase
a
door
was
open
on
the
right
and
i
saw
a
bed
within
but
we
went
up
a
couple
more
steps
on
the
left
and
came
out
into
the
principal
of
the
house
it
was
a
very
good
chamber
this
panelled
about
eight
feet
up
the
walls
with
the
bricks
shewing
above
but
whitewashed
a
hearth
was
on
the
right
a
couple
of
windows
in
the
wall
opposite
and
another
door
beyond
the
hearth
the
furniture
was
very
plain
but
very
good
a
great
table
stood
under
the
windows
with
three
or
four
chairs
about
it
the
walls
seemed
immensely
strong
and
and
though
the
place
could
not
stand
out
for
above
an
hour
or
two
against
guns
in
the
old
days
it
could
have
faced
a
little
siege
of
very
well
rumbald
when
he
had
seen
me
shut
the
door
behind
me
went
across
to
the
table
and
put
down
his
whip
upon
it
sit
down
sir
he
said
here
is
my
little
stronghold
he
said
it
with
a
grim
kind
of
geniality
at
which
i
did
not
know
whether
to
be
encouraged
or
not
i
did
as
he
told
me
and
looked
about
me
with
as
easy
an
air
as
i
could
muster
a
little
stronghold
indeed
i
said
he
paid
no
attention
now
sir
he
said
we
have
not
very
much
time
supper
will
be
up
in
half
in
hour
we
had
best
have
our
talk
first
and
then
you
may
send
for
your
servant
old
alick
will
find
him
out
with
all
my
heart
i
said
wondering
that
he
made
so
much
of
my
servant
he
sat
down
suddenly
and
looked
at
me
very
heavily
and
penetratingly
sir
he
said
you
are
going
to
hear
the
truth
at
last
i
said
we
had
not
much
time
well
we
have
not
then
let
me
have
the
truth
quickly
i
said
he
took
his
eyes
from
my
face
i
was
glad
of
that
as
i
did
not
greatly
like
his
regard
what
thought
i
if
i
be
alone
with
a
madman
well
sir
he
said
we
are
driven
desperate
as
you
may
have
guessed
i
say
we
for
you
have
identified
yourself
with
our
cause
a
hundred
times
over
my
lord
shaftesbury
is
gone
my
lord
essex
is
hanging
back
well
but
those
are
not
all
we
have
other
men
besides
those
that
have
been
urged
on
and
urged
on
and
now
can
not
be
restrained
i
have
tried
to
restrain
them
myself
here
he
gulped
in
his
throat
lying
was
not
very
easy
to
this
man
i
think
and
i
have
failed
well
sir
i
must
trust
you
more
than
i
have
ever
trusted
you
before
again
he
stopped
then
all
came
out
with
a
rush
not
half
a
mile
from
here
said
he
along
the
newmarket
road
there
be
twenty
men
with
blunderbusses
and
other
arms
waiting
for
his
majesty
and
the
duke
who
will
come
but
how
do
you
know
cried
i
all
bewildered
for
the
instant
his
head
shook
with
passion
listen
said
he
we
have
had
certain
information
that
they
come
this
way
why
do
you
think
we
have
not
again
he
broke
off
but
i
knew
well
enough
what
he
would
have
said
i
tell
you
we
know
it
the
king
is
not
lying
at
royston
he
comes
by
this
road
now
then
sir
what
do
you
say
to
that
my
mind
was
still
all
in
a
whirl
i
had
looked
for
sudden
danger
but
not
so
sudden
as
this
half
a
dozen
questions
flashed
before
me
i
put
the
first
into
words
why
have
you
told
me
i
cried
his
face
contracted
suddenly
it
was
growing
very
dark
by
now
and
we
had
no
candles
the
muscles
of
his
face
stood
out
like
cords
not
so
loud
said
he
and
then
well
are
you
not
one
of
us
you
are
pledged
very
deeply
sir
i
tell
you
then
came
the
blessed
relief
for
the
first
moment
so
genuine
appeared
his
passion
i
had
believed
him
and
that
the
ambushment
was
there
as
he
had
said
then
like
a
train
of
gunpowder
light
ran
along
my
mind
and
i
understood
that
it
was
the
same
game
still
that
they
were
playing
with
me
that
there
was
no
ambushment
ready
that
they
had
indeed
fixed
upon
this
journey
of
the
king
but
that
they
were
unprepared
and
desired
delay
his
anxiety
about
my
servant
his
evident
displeasure
and
impatience
his
sending
for
me
at
all
when
he
must
have
known
over
and
over
again
that
i
was
not
of
his
party
each
detail
fitted
in
like
a
puzzle
and
yet
i
must
not
shew
a
sign
of
it
i
hid
my
face
in
my
hands
for
a
moment
to
think
what
i
could
answer
then
i
looked
up
rumbald
said
i
you
are
right
i
am
too
deeply
pledged
tell
me
what
i
am
to
do
it
is
sink
or
swim
with
me
now
he
believed
of
course
that
i
was
lying
and
so
i
was
but
not
as
he
thought
he
believed
that
he
had
gained
his
point
and
the
relief
of
that
thought
melted
him
he
believed
that
is
that
i
should
presently
make
an
excuse
to
get
hold
of
my
servant
and
send
him
off
to
delay
the
king
coming
then
i
suppose
he
saw
the
one
flaw
in
his
design
and
he
strove
very
pitifully
to
put
it
right
one
more
thing
mallock
said
he
this
is
not
the
only
party
that
waits
for
him
there
is
another
on
the
royston
road
among
the
downs
near
barkway
they
will
catch
him
whichever
way
he
comes
i
nodded
i
had
supposed
so
i
said
for
i
did
not
wish
to
confuse
him
further
well
said
he
why
i
have
sent
for
you
is
that
you
may
help
me
here
there
may
be
more
guards
with
the
king
than
we
think
for
it
may
come
to
a
fight
and
even
a
siege
here
if
they
come
this
way
we
must
be
ready
to
defend
this
place
for
a
little
it
was
indeed
pitiful
to
see
how
poor
he
was
as
an
actor
his
sternness
was
all
gone
or
very
nearly
he
babbled
freely
and
drunkenly
walking
up
and
down
the
chamber
like
a
restless
beast
he
told
me
point
after
point
that
he
need
not
even
their
very
code
how
and
and
stood
for
blunderbusses
and
muskets
and
pistols
and
sand
and
ink
for
powder
and
balls
it
was
as
i
say
pitiful
to
see
him
now
that
his
anxiety
was
over
and
he
had
me
as
he
thought
in
his
toils
it
was
a
very
strange
nature
that
he
had
altogether
this
old
cromwellian
and
puritan
and
i
am
not
sure
to
this
day
whether
he
were
not
in
good
faith
in
his
murderous
designs
i
thought
of
these
things
even
at
this
moment
and
wondered
what
he
would
do
if
he
knew
the
truth
at
supper
he
fell
silent
again
and
even
morose
and
i
think
it
possible
he
may
have
had
some
suspicions
of
me
for
he
suspected
everyone
i
think
but
he
brightened
wonderfully
when
i
said
with
a
very
innocent
air
that
i
would
like
my
servant
to
be
fetched
and
that
i
would
give
him
his
instructions
and
send
him
back
to
london
for
that
i
did
not
wish
to
embroil
him
in
this
matter
why
certainly
mallock
he
said
it
is
what
i
wish
i
trust
you
utterly
as
you
see
you
shall
see
him
where
you
will
he
turned
to
his
old
man
who
came
in
at
that
instant
and
bade
him
fetch
mallock
servant
from
hoddesdon
i
described
him
to
alick
and
scribbled
a
note
that
would
bring
him
then
we
fell
to
the
same
kind
of
talking
again
it
was
eight
pretty
well
by
the
time
that
james
came
to
the
rye
i
had
determined
to
see
him
out
of
doors
where
none
could
hear
us
and
before
eight
i
was
walking
up
and
down
in
the
dark
between
the
gate
and
the
house
talking
to
my
host
when
the
two
men
came
through
the
gate
rumbald
was
very
particular
to
leave
me
immediately
that
i
might
as
he
thought
send
my
man
to
newmarket
to
put
off
the
king
coming
and
have
no
interruption
i
will
leave
you
said
he
you
shall
see
how
much
i
trust
you
i
waited
till
he
was
gone
in
and
the
door
shut
then
i
took
james
apart
into
a
little
walled
garden
that
i
had
noticed
as
i
came
in
where
we
could
not
by
any
chance
be
overheard
even
then
too
i
spoke
in
a
very
small
whisper
james
said
i
go
back
to
hoddesdon
and
get
a
fresh
horse
leave
all
luggage
behind
and
ride
as
light
as
you
can
for
you
must
go
straight
to
newmarket
and
be
there
before
six
at
any
cost
go
straight
to
the
king
lodgings
and
ask
for
any
of
chiffinch
men
that
are
there
whom
you
know
do
you
know
of
any
who
are
there
yes
sir
whispered
james
and
he
named
one
very
good
with
him
you
must
go
straight
to
his
majesty
and
have
him
awakened
if
need
be
tell
him
that
you
come
from
me
men
will
support
you
in
that
tell
his
majesty
that
if
he
values
his
life
he
must
return
to
town
and
not
sleep
anywhere
on
the
way
and
that
the
duke
of
york
must
come
with
him
tell
him
that
there
is
no
fear
whatever
if
he
comes
at
once
but
that
there
is
every
fear
if
he
delays
he
had
best
come
too
by
this
road
and
not
by
royston
you
understand
yes
sir
i
shall
remain
here
until
night
at
the
earliest
if
i
am
not
at
home
by
sunday
night
go
to
chiffinch
as
i
told
you
this
morning
is
all
clear
yes
sir
then
go
at
once
spare
no
horses
or
expense
james
sir
i
watched
him
out
of
the
gate
then
i
turned
and
went
back
to
the
house
chapter
x
it
was
a
strange
night
and
day
that
followed
on
the
one
side
my
host
found
it
hard
i
think
to
maintain
the
story
he
had
told
me
in
action
for
in
accordance
with
his
tale
he
had
to
bear
himself
as
though
he
expected
before
nightfall
the
assassination
of
the
king
and
his
royal
highness
half
a
mile
away
and
the
rush
of
the
murderers
to
his
house
for
shelter
on
my
side
it
was
scarcely
less
hard
for
i
knew
nothing
of
how
my
man
james
had
fared
or
whether
or
no
his
majesty
would
act
upon
my
message
i
guessed
however
that
he
would
if
only
my
man
got
there
for
chiffinch
men
who
now
followed
him
everywhere
would
be
as
eager
as
i
that
no
danger
should
come
to
him
my
plans
therefore
were
more
secure
than
rumbald
since
i
knew
either
that
his
majesty
would
come
and
no
harm
done
or
that
merely
he
would
not
come
in
the
latter
case
rumbald
would
be
certified
that
i
had
done
as
he
thought
i
would
and
would
no
doubt
let
me
go
peacefully
to
use
me
again
later
in
the
same
manner
if
occasion
rose
for
myself
then
i
intended
after
nightfall
at
the
latest
to
ride
back
to
london
and
report
all
that
had
passed
and
if
the
king
had
not
come
to
lay
all
in
chiffinch
hands
for
his
further
protection
i
was
left
a
good
deal
to
myself
during
the
morning
powers
of
dissimulation
being
i
think
less
than
his
desire
for
them
and
i
did
not
quarrel
with
that
i
was
very
restless
myself
and
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
in
examining
the
house
and
the
old
arms
used
no
doubt
forty
years
ago
in
the
civil
war
that
were
hung
up
everywhere
within
as
well
as
without
it
was
liker
an
arsenal
or
a
barracks
than
a
its
lonely
situation
too
and
its
strength
made
it
a
very
suitable
place
for
such
a
design
as
that
which
its
owner
had
for
it
the
great
chamber
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
over
the
archway
where
we
had
our
food
was
no
doubt
the
room
where
the
conspirators
had
held
their
meetings
a
little
before
eleven
as
i
was
walking
in
the
open
space
between
the
house
and
the
gate
i
saw
a
fellow
look
in
suddenly
from
the
road
and
then
was
away
again
every
movement
perturbed
me
as
may
be
imagined
in
such
suspense
yet
anything
was
better
than
ignorance
and
i
called
out
to
let
him
see
that
i
had
observed
him
so
he
came
forward
again
and
i
saw
him
to
be
the
little
carpenter
or
what
not
that
had
wished
to
speak
to
rumbald
yesterday
at
the
inn
he
saluted
me
very
properly
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
said
he
but
is
rumbald
within
now
i
had
seen
rumbald
not
ten
minutes
ago
slip
back
into
the
house
from
the
outhouses
where
he
had
pretended
to
go
upon
some
preparation
or
other
for
the
reception
of
the
assassins
this
evening
but
he
had
not
known
that
i
saw
him
he
is
very
busy
at
present
said
i
can
not
i
do
your
business
for
you
i
tried
to
look
as
if
i
knew
more
than
i
did
why
sir
he
said
i
think
not
he
seemed
i
thought
in
a
very
pitiable
state
i
learned
some
months
later
that
he
was
come
down
expressly
to
dissuade
rumbald
from
any
attempt
at
that
time
but
i
did
not
know
that
then
here
only
thought
i
is
one
of
the
ones
i
determined
to
play
upon
his
fears
if
i
could
and
at
the
same
time
perhaps
upon
his
hopes
i
think
i
can
however
i
said
you
would
be
out
of
the
business
if
you
could
would
you
not
he
turned
so
white
that
i
thought
he
would
have
fallen
i
saw
that
my
shot
had
told
but
it
was
not
a
hard
one
to
make
hold
up
man
i
said
why
what
do
you
suppose
i
am
here
for
what
business
sir
he
said
i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
i
smiled
so
that
he
could
see
me
do
it
very
good
then
i
said
i
will
leave
you
to
rumbald
and
i
made
as
if
i
would
pass
on
sir
he
said
can
you
give
me
any
assurance
i
am
terrified
and
indeed
he
looked
it
so
i
supposed
that
he
thought
that
the
attempt
was
indeed
to
be
made
i
determined
on
a
bold
stroke
my
man
i
said
if
you
will
tell
me
your
name
and
then
begone
at
once
back
to
town
i
will
tell
you
something
that
will
be
of
service
to
you
if
not
and
i
broke
off
he
looked
at
me
piteously
i
think
my
air
frightened
him
he
drew
back
a
little
from
the
house
though
we
were
in
a
place
where
we
could
not
be
seen
from
the
windows
my
name
is
keeling
sir
you
will
not
betray
me
what
is
it
sir
well
said
i
i
can
give
you
an
assurance
that
what
you
fear
will
not
take
place
there
is
not
a
man
here
beyond
myself
and
rumbald
and
old
alick
now
begone
at
once
stay
where
do
you
live
he
shook
his
head
a
little
colour
had
come
back
to
his
face
again
at
the
news
no
sir
that
was
not
in
the
bargain
i
will
begone
sir
as
you
said
and
thank
you
sir
he
slipped
back
again
very
quickly
and
was
vanished
i
suppose
that
he
had
ridden
down
in
some
cart
all
night
and
that
he
went
back
in
the
same
way
for
i
saw
no
more
of
him
well
i
had
gained
two
little
points
i
had
kept
him
from
rumbald
which
was
one
for
i
did
not
want
my
host
to
consult
with
any
if
i
could
help
it
and
i
had
learned
what
perhaps
was
his
name
this
however
i
would
test
for
myself
presently
at
noon
we
dined
and
having
observed
no
difference
in
my
host
manner
that
might
shew
that
he
had
any
idea
i
had
met
with
anyone
i
made
two
remarks
i
talked
with
a
fellow
at
the
gate
this
morning
i
said
he
seemed
to
know
nothing
of
the
king
coming
rumbald
jerked
his
head
impatiently
and
i
perceived
that
we
had
not
been
seen
presently
i
said
who
was
that
fellow
who
wished
to
speak
with
you
yesterday
rumbald
at
the
he
looked
sharply
at
me
for
an
instant
his
name
is
thompson
said
he
he
is
one
of
my
then
i
knew
that
he
had
lied
a
man
does
not
invent
the
name
of
keeling
but
very
easily
the
name
of
thompson
so
i
saw
that
rumbald
had
not
yet
lost
all
discretion
and
indeed
for
all
his
talk
he
had
hardly
spoken
a
name
that
i
could
get
hold
of
after
a
while
i
ventured
on
another
sentence
which
suited
my
purpose
and
at
the
same
time
confirmed
him
in
his
own
view
if
by
any
chance
his
majesty
should
not
come
will
it
be
done
do
you
think
shall
you
wait
till
he
does
come
he
shook
his
head
and
lied
again
very
promptly
if
it
is
not
done
it
will
never
be
done
looking
back
on
the
affair
now
i
truly
do
wonder
at
the
adroitness
with
which
we
both
talked
there
was
scarcely
a
slip
on
either
side
though
we
were
at
if
ever
men
were
but
i
suppose
that
in
both
of
us
there
was
a
very
great
tension
of
mind
as
of
men
walking
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
and
it
was
the
knowledge
of
that
which
saved
us
both
after
dinner
i
said
i
would
walk
again
out
of
doors
and
he
thought
it
was
mere
affectation
since
i
must
know
by
now
that
his
majesty
was
not
coming
well
i
said
if
by
any
mischance
his
majesty
doth
not
come
i
will
get
back
to
town
he
looked
at
me
but
he
kept
any
kind
of
irony
out
of
his
face
you
had
best
do
that
he
said
now
it
must
have
been
forty
miles
from
newmarket
to
the
rye
and
i
had
calculated
that
his
majesty
would
not
start
till
nine
at
the
earliest
he
would
have
four
horses
and
would
change
them
at
least
three
times
but
they
would
not
be
able
to
go
out
of
a
trot
for
most
of
the
way
so
that
i
need
not
look
for
any
news
of
him
till
three
at
the
earliest
from
then
till
five
would
be
the
time
if
he
were
not
come
by
five
or
at
the
very
latest
i
should
know
that
my
design
had
miscarried
it
is
very
difficult
for
me
to
describe
at
all
the
state
i
was
in
all
the
more
as
i
dared
not
shew
it
it
was
not
merely
that
my
sovereign
was
at
stake
but
a
great
deal
more
than
that
my
religion
too
was
in
some
peril
for
if
by
any
mischance
things
should
not
go
as
i
expected
if
as
certainly
occurred
to
my
mind
as
one
possibility
in
ten
i
had
completely
mistaken
rumbald
and
he
had
spoken
the
truth
for
once
it
was
not
the
king
only
who
would
perish
but
the
catholic
heir
also
and
then
to
all
our
hopes
yet
i
declare
that
even
this
did
not
affect
me
so
much
as
the
thought
that
it
was
the
man
whom
i
had
learned
to
love
that
was
in
peril
to
love
in
spite
of
his
selfishness
and
his
indolence
and
his
sins
it
was
all
but
an
intolerable
thought
to
me
that
that
melancholy
fiery
man
who
had
so
scolded
me
whom
to
tell
the
truth
i
had
scolded
back
that
this
man
might
even
in
imagination
be
mixed
up
with
the
horror
of
the
firing
of
guns
and
the
plunging
of
the
wounded
horses
should
himself
be
shot
at
and
murdered
there
in
the
lonely
hertfordshire
lane
at
about
three
i
could
bear
it
no
more
god
knows
how
many
prayers
i
had
said
for
i
think
i
prayed
all
the
time
as
even
careless
men
will
do
at
such
crises
there
was
the
grim
house
behind
me
the
leafless
trees
overhead
the
lane
stretching
up
northwards
beyond
the
gate
all
was
very
silent
except
for
the
barking
of
a
dog
now
and
again
it
was
a
very
solitary
place
the
very
place
for
a
murder
there
were
no
meadows
near
us
where
men
might
be
working
but
only
the
deep
woods
it
was
a
clearish
kind
of
day
with
clouds
in
the
west
at
about
three
then
i
went
to
the
stables
to
see
my
horse
these
were
behind
the
house
there
was
no
one
about
and
no
other
horse
in
the
stables
but
rumbald
own
black
mare
that
had
carried
him
yesterday
it
came
to
me
as
i
looked
at
my
horse
that
no
harm
would
be
done
if
i
put
the
saddle
on
him
rumbald
would
but
think
me
a
little
foolish
for
so
confessing
in
action
that
i
knew
the
king
would
not
come
and
for
myself
it
would
be
some
relief
to
my
feelings
to
know
that
if
by
any
mischance
i
did
hear
the
sound
of
shots
i
could
at
least
ride
up
and
do
my
best
though
i
knew
it
would
be
too
late
i
saddled
my
horse
then
and
put
on
the
bridle
as
quickly
as
i
could
then
again
i
thought
there
would
be
no
harm
done
if
i
led
him
out
to
the
gate
and
fastened
him
there
i
looked
out
of
the
stable
door
but
there
was
no
one
in
sight
so
i
led
my
horse
out
as
quietly
as
i
could
yet
openly
and
brought
him
round
past
the
front
of
the
house
and
so
towards
the
gate
i
thought
nothing
of
my
valise
for
at
that
time
i
intended
no
more
than
what
i
had
said
i
was
uneasy
and
had
no
determined
plans
i
would
tell
rumbald
if
he
came
out
that
i
was
but
holding
myself
ready
to
ride
out
if
i
were
needed
then
as
i
came
past
the
front
of
the
house
i
heard
very
distinctly
in
the
still
air
the
tramp
of
horses
far
away
on
the
hill
to
the
north
and
i
knew
enough
of
that
sound
to
tell
me
that
there
were
at
least
eight
or
nine
coming
and
coming
fast
now
it
might
have
been
the
coach
of
anyone
coming
that
way
the
races
were
at
newmarket
and
plenty
went
to
and
fro
though
it
is
true
that
none
had
come
this
way
all
day
yet
at
that
sound
my
heart
leapt
up
both
in
excitement
and
terror
what
if
i
had
made
any
mistake
and
enticed
the
king
to
his
death
well
it
would
be
my
death
too
but
i
swear
i
did
not
think
of
that
all
i
know
is
that
i
broke
into
a
run
and
the
horse
into
a
trot
after
me
and
as
i
reached
the
gate
heard
rumbald
run
out
of
the
house
behind
me
i
paid
him
no
attention
at
all
though
i
heard
his
breathing
at
my
shoulder
i
was
listening
for
the
tramp
and
rattle
of
the
hoofs
again
for
the
sound
had
died
away
in
a
hollow
of
the
road
i
suppose
then
again
they
rang
out
and
i
thought
they
must
be
coming
very
near
the
place
he
had
told
me
of
and
i
turned
and
looked
at
him
but
i
think
he
did
not
see
me
he
too
was
staring
out
his
face
gone
pale
under
its
ruddiness
listening
for
what
very
well
might
be
the
end
of
all
his
hopes
then
the
distant
hoofs
grew
muffled
once
more
though
not
altogether
and
at
that
rumbald
ran
out
into
the
road
as
he
was
bareheaded
and
i
saw
that
he
carried
a
cleaver
in
his
hand
caught
up
i
suppose
at
random
for
it
was
of
no
use
to
him
then
loud
and
clear
not
a
hundred
yards
away
i
heard
the
rattle
and
roar
of
a
coach
coming
down
the
hill
and
the
tramp
of
the
hoofs
back
you
fool
i
screamed
back
for
i
dared
not
pull
my
horse
out
into
the
road
throw
it
away
he
turned
on
me
with
the
face
of
a
devil
though
he
must
have
seen
the
liveries
and
the
guardsmen
from
where
he
stood
i
think
not
even
yet
did
he
take
in
how
he
had
been
deceived
but
that
he
began
to
suspect
it
i
have
no
doubt
he
came
back
at
my
cry
as
if
unwillingly
and
stood
by
my
side
but
never
a
word
did
he
say
and
together
we
waited
then
past
the
gate
on
the
left
over
the
hedge
i
caught
a
flash
of
colour
and
another
come
and
gone
again
and
then
the
gleam
of
a
and
though
i
had
no
certainty
from
my
senses
i
was
as
sure
it
was
the
king
as
if
i
had
seen
him
so
we
waited
still
i
drew
up
in
my
hands
my
horse
bridle
not
knowing
what
i
did
and
moved
round
to
where
i
could
mount
if
there
were
any
road
and
as
i
did
it
past
the
gate
full
in
view
there
swept
at
a
gallop
first
three
guards
riding
abreast
a
brave
blaze
of
colour
in
the
dusky
lane
then
the
four
grey
horses
with
their
postilions
cracking
their
whips
then
the
coach
and
as
this
passed
as
plain
as
a
picture
i
saw
the
king
lean
forward
and
look
his
great
hat
and
periwig
thrust
forward
and
behind
him
another
man
then
the
coach
was
gone
and
two
more
guards
flew
by
and
were
gone
too
i
lost
my
head
completely
for
the
single
time
i
think
in
all
this
affair
now
that
i
knew
that
the
king
was
safe
there
standing
where
i
was
i
lifted
my
hat
and
shouted
with
my
full
voice
god
save
the
king
i
turned
as
i
shouted
and
as
the
last
word
left
my
lips
i
saw
rumbald
his
face
afire
with
anger
coming
at
me
round
my
horse
from
behind
with
the
cleaver
upraised
if
he
had
not
been
near
mad
with
disappointment
he
would
have
struck
at
my
horse
but
he
was
too
intent
on
me
for
that
i
leapt
forward
for
i
had
no
time
to
do
anything
else
dragging
my
horse
haunches
forward
again
and
round
and
with
the
next
movement
i
was
across
my
saddle
as
my
horse
started
and
plunged
i
was
ten
yards
away
before
the
man
could
do
anything
and
struggling
to
my
seat
but
as
i
rose
and
gripped
the
reins
something
flew
over
my
head
scarce
missing
it
by
six
inches
and
i
saw
the
blade
of
the
cleaver
flash
into
the
ditch
beyond
at
that
i
turned
and
lifted
my
hat
reining
in
my
horse
for
i
was
as
mad
with
success
as
the
other
man
with
failure
god
save
the
king
i
cried
again
ah
rumbald
if
only
you
had
learned
to
speak
the
truth
then
i
put
in
my
spurs
and
was
gone
hearing
before
me
the
hollow
tramp
and
rumble
of
the
great
coach
in
front
as
the
king
party
went
across
the
bridge
chapter
xi
it
was
three
months
later
that
i
sat
once
more
though
not
for
the
first
time
since
my
adventure
at
the
rye
in
chiffinch
parlour
of
those
three
months
i
need
not
say
very
much
especially
of
the
beginning
of
them
since
i
received
then
i
think
more
compliments
than
ever
in
my
life
before
my
interviews
had
been
very
many
not
with
chiffinch
only
but
with
two
other
personages
whose
lives
they
were
pleased
to
say
i
had
saved
his
majesty
had
laughed
very
heartily
indeed
at
the
tale
of
my
adventures
said
he
we
had
all
been
done
but
for
you
mallock
it
was
three
or
four
days
after
at
the
least
that
i
had
intended
returning
and
by
that
time
no
doubt
our
friends
would
have
had
their
ambushment
complete
but
when
your
man
came
all
into
my
very
telling
me
to
fly
for
my
life
well
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
there
was
a
fire
too
at
my
lodgings
that
same
morning
and
poor
sir
christopher
low
ceilings
all
ruined
with
the
smoke
but
that
would
not
have
brought
me
though
i
suppose
we
must
give
out
that
it
did
no
mallock
was
you
and
no
other
i
did
not
think
i
had
such
an
accomplished
liar
in
my
service
his
royal
highness
too
was
no
less
gracious
though
he
talked
in
a
very
different
fashion
to
him
there
was
no
humour
in
the
matter
at
all
was
all
providence
and
i
am
not
sure
but
that
he
was
not
more
right
than
his
brother
though
indeed
there
are
always
two
sides
to
a
thing
his
talk
was
less
of
myself
and
more
of
the
interests
i
had
served
and
there
too
he
was
right
for
as
i
have
said
if
there
had
been
any
mistake
in
the
matter
to
catholic
hopes
my
first
interview
with
chiffinch
astonished
me
most
when
he
had
finished
paying
compliments
i
began
on
business
you
will
hardly
catch
rumbald
said
i
unless
you
take
him
pretty
soon
he
too
will
be
off
to
holland
i
think
he
shook
his
head
smiling
i
am
sorry
not
to
be
able
to
give
you
vengeance
for
that
but
you
must
wait
awhile
wait
cried
i
what
single
name
do
you
know
besides
that
of
rumbald
which
was
certainly
involved
in
this
affair
why
mallock
you
yourself
have
told
me
that
he
observed
discretion
so
far
and
did
not
name
a
single
man
well
there
is
keeling
i
said
and
what
is
keeling
he
asked
with
some
contempt
a
maltster
and
a
carpenter
a
fine
bag
of
assassins
and
how
can
you
prove
anything
but
treasonable
talk
where
were
the
and
the
and
the
ink
did
you
set
eyes
on
any
of
them
i
was
silent
no
no
mallock
we
must
wait
awhile
i
have
even
talked
to
jeffreys
and
he
says
the
same
we
must
lime
more
birds
before
we
pull
our
twig
down
now
if
you
could
lay
your
hand
on
keeling
he
was
right
i
saw
that
well
enough
and
meantime
said
i
smiling
i
must
go
in
peril
of
my
life
they
surely
know
now
what
part
i
have
played
they
must
be
fools
if
they
do
not
but
there
will
be
no
more
for
the
present
if
you
take
but
reasonable
care
meanwhile
you
may
go
to
hare
street
if
you
will
though
i
can
not
say
i
should
advise
it
and
i
will
look
for
keeling
well
i
did
not
take
his
advice
that
was
too
much
to
expect
i
went
to
hare
street
in
april
and
remained
there
a
couple
of
months
but
i
do
not
propose
to
discourse
on
that
beyond
saying
that
i
was
very
well
satisfied
and
even
with
cousin
tom
himself
who
appeared
to
me
more
resigned
to
have
me
as
a
to
neither
of
them
could
i
say
a
word
of
what
had
passed
except
to
tell
dolly
that
my
peril
was
over
for
the
present
and
to
thank
her
for
her
prayers
during
those
two
months
i
had
no
word
of
rumbald
at
all
and
i
suspect
that
he
lay
very
quiet
knowing
after
all
how
little
i
knew
if
he
went
to
holland
he
certainly
came
back
again
then
in
june
once
more
a
man
came
from
chiffinch
to
call
me
to
town
so
here
i
sat
once
more
with
the
birds
singing
their
vespers
in
the
privy
garden
a
hundred
yards
away
and
the
river
flowing
without
the
windows
as
if
no
blood
had
ever
flowed
with
it
well
said
chiffinch
when
i
was
down
in
a
chair
the
first
news
is
that
we
have
found
keeling
you
were
right
or
very
nearly
he
is
a
joiner
and
lives
in
the
city
he
hath
been
to
the
secretary
of
the
council
and
will
go
to
him
again
how
was
that
done
i
asked
why
i
sent
a
couple
of
men
to
him
said
the
page
when
we
had
marked
him
down
who
so
worked
on
his
fears
that
he
went
straight
to
my
lord
dartmouth
and
my
lord
dartmouth
carried
him
to
sir
leoline
jenkins
the
secretary
very
properly
remarked
that
he
was
but
one
witness
and
keeling
went
away
again
to
see
if
he
can
find
another
well
the
tale
is
that
he
hath
found
another
his
own
brother
and
that
both
will
go
again
to
the
secretary
so
i
thought
it
best
that
you
should
see
him
first
here
to
identify
him
for
certain
that
is
very
good
i
said
but
chaffinch
if
i
appear
too
publicly
in
this
matter
i
shall
be
of
very
little
service
to
the
king
hereafter
i
know
that
very
well
said
the
page
and
you
shall
not
appear
publicly
at
all
neither
shall
your
name
indeed
the
king
hath
a
little
more
business
for
you
at
last
in
france
and
you
will
wish
perhaps
to
go
to
rome
so
the
best
thing
that
you
can
do
when
we
have
seen
that
all
is
in
order
is
to
wait
no
longer
but
be
off
and
for
a
good
while
too
your
life
may
be
in
some
peril
for
the
very
particular
part
that
you
played
for
though
we
shall
catch
i
think
all
the
principal
men
in
the
affair
we
shall
not
catch
all
the
underlings
and
even
a
joiner
or
a
scavenger
for
that
matter
if
he
be
angry
enough
is
enough
to
let
the
life
out
of
a
man
and
we
can
not
spare
you
yet
mr
mallock
this
seemed
to
me
both
reasonable
and
thoughtful
and
it
was
not
altogether
a
surprise
to
me
indeed
i
had
prepared
dolly
for
a
long
absence
thinking
that
i
might
go
to
rome
again
as
i
had
not
been
there
for
a
long
while
besides
waiting
in
england
for
the
time
laid
down
by
tom
and
agreed
to
by
both
of
us
would
make
that
time
come
no
swifter
and
if
there
were
work
to
be
done
i
had
best
do
it
before
i
had
a
wife
to
engage
my
attention
but
i
sighed
a
little
well
said
i
and
where
is
keeling
i
have
been
expecting
him
this
last
ten
minutes
said
he
even
as
he
spoke
a
knock
came
upon
the
door
the
page
cried
to
come
in
and
there
entered
first
a
servant
holding
the
door
and
then
the
little
joiner
himself
flushed
in
his
face
i
supposed
with
the
excitement
he
was
dressed
in
his
sunday
clothes
rather
he
did
not
know
me
i
think
for
he
made
no
movement
of
surprise
i
caught
chiffinch
look
of
inquiry
and
nodded
very
slightly
well
sir
began
the
page
in
a
very
severe
tone
so
you
have
made
up
your
mind
to
evade
the
charge
of
misprision
of
treason
that
at
the
least
yes
sir
said
the
man
in
a
very
timid
way
he
must
have
heard
that
phrase
pretty
often
lately
well
and
you
have
found
your
other
witness
yes
sir
my
own
brother
sir
ah
was
he
too
in
this
detestable
affair
no
sir
well
then
how
do
you
bring
him
in
sir
said
the
man
seeming
to
recover
himself
a
little
i
put
my
brother
in
a
secret
place
and
then
caused
him
to
overhear
a
conversation
between
myself
and
another
very
pretty
very
pretty
cried
the
page
and
who
was
this
other
sir
it
was
a
goodenough
once
of
i
could
not
restrain
a
start
for
i
had
not
thought
goodenough
the
friend
of
my
lord
essex
to
be
so
deep
in
the
affair
as
this
keeling
saw
me
start
i
suppose
for
he
looked
at
me
and
himself
showed
sudden
agitation
good
evening
keeling
said
i
we
have
had
a
little
conversation
once
before
oh
for
god
sake
gentlemen
for
god
sake
i
am
already
within
an
inch
of
my
life
i
know
you
are
said
chiffinch
severely
and
you
will
be
nearer
even
than
that
if
you
do
not
speak
the
whole
truth
sir
it
is
not
that
i
mean
cried
the
man
in
a
very
panic
of
terror
rumbald
hath
been
eh
what
is
that
said
chiffinch
rumbald
sir
the
old
colonel
of
the
rye
god
man
we
know
all
about
rumbald
said
the
page
contemptuously
what
hath
he
been
at
now
sir
he
and
some
of
the
others
caught
me
but
yesterday
they
had
heard
some
tale
of
my
having
been
to
secretary
and
and
you
swore
you
had
not
i
suppose
snarled
the
other
sir
what
could
i
do
rumbald
was
all
for
despatching
me
then
and
there
they
caught
me
at
wapping
i
prayed
them
for
god
love
not
to
believe
such
things
i
entreated
i
wept
i
be
bound
you
did
said
chiffinch
well
and
what
then
sir
they
let
me
go
again
they
did
the
damned
fools
cried
chiffinch
i
was
astonished
at
his
vehemence
but
like
his
master
if
there
was
one
thing
that
the
page
could
not
bear
it
was
a
fool
i
made
him
a
little
sign
keeling
said
i
you
remember
me
well
enough
well
i
need
not
say
that
we
know
pretty
near
everything
that
there
is
to
know
but
we
must
have
it
from
you
too
tell
us
both
now
as
near
as
you
can
recollect
every
name
to
which
you
can
speak
with
certainty
remember
we
want
no
lies
we
had
enough
of
them
a
while
back
in
another
plot
i
could
not
resist
that
though
chiffinch
snapped
his
lips
together
well
now
take
your
time
no
do
not
speak
consider
yourself
carefully
it
was
indeed
a
miserable
sight
to
see
this
poor
wretch
so
hemmed
in
the
sweet
evening
light
fell
full
upon
his
terrified
eyes
and
his
working
lips
as
he
sought
to
gather
up
the
names
he
was
persuaded
i
am
sure
that
we
were
as
gods
knowing
all
things
above
all
he
feared
myself
as
i
could
see
having
met
me
first
at
the
very
house
of
rumbald
as
if
i
were
his
friend
and
now
again
in
the
chamber
of
his
accuser
it
was
piteous
to
see
how
he
sought
to
be
very
exact
in
his
memories
and
not
go
by
a
hair
breadth
beyond
the
truth
at
last
i
let
him
speak
now
then
i
said
tell
us
the
names
i
saw
as
i
spoke
that
chiffinch
held
a
below
the
table
to
take
them
down
sir
these
for
certain
rumbald
west
rumsey
slowly
man
slowly
i
cried
rumsey
goodenough
burton
thompson
barber
those
last
three
all
of
wapping
sir
then
sir
there
is
wade
nelthrop
west
walcot
he
hesitated
well
sir
demanded
chiffinch
very
fiercely
that
is
not
all
no
sir
no
no
there
is
hone
a
joiner
like
myself
man
cried
the
page
we
want
better
names
than
snivelling
tradesmen
like
yourself
the
fellow
turned
even
paler
well
sir
but
how
can
i
tell
that
sir
said
the
page
to
me
sharply
call
the
guard
sir
cried
the
poor
wretch
i
will
tell
all
indeed
i
will
tell
well
sir
the
duke
of
monmouth
was
in
it
at
least
we
heard
so
he
was
certainly
in
the
former
plot
and
what
was
that
asked
the
other
very
quietly
why
sir
the
plot
to
assault
whitehall
it
is
all
one
in
reality
but
we
know
all
about
that
snapped
the
page
sharply
well
and
what
other
names
sir
there
was
my
lord
russell
i
moved
in
my
chair
even
to
this
day
i
can
not
believe
that
that
peer
was
guilty
though
indeed
he
was
found
so
to
be
chiffinch
cast
me
a
look
proceed
sir
he
said
and
there
was
ferguson
a
minister
and
wildman
and
my
lord
argyle
in
scotland
and
my
lord
howard
of
escrick
and
sidney
and
my
lord
essex
i
do
not
say
sir
that
all
those
there
there
go
on
we
shall
test
every
word
you
say
you
may
depend
upon
it
what
other
names
have
you
there
was
my
lord
grey
sir
and
sir
thomas
armstrong
sir
i
can
remember
no
more
and
a
pretty
load
on
any
man
conscience
cried
the
virtuous
chiffinch
and
so
all
this
nest
of
assassins
sir
i
did
not
say
that
i
said
that
is
enough
we
want
no
comments
and
glosses
but
the
bare
truth
well
keeling
if
this
tale
be
true
you
have
saved
your
own
life
that
is
if
your
fellow
murderers
do
not
get
at
you
again
you
have
been
in
trouble
before
i
hear
too
sir
it
was
on
the
matter
of
the
lord
mayor
i
know
that
well
enough
well
sir
so
this
is
the
tale
you
will
tell
to
mr
secretary
yes
sir
if
i
can
remember
it
all
you
will
remember
it
i
warrant
well
sir
i
think
i
have
no
more
questions
for
the
present
sir
have
you
any
questions
to
ask
this
man
i
shook
my
head
i
was
near
sick
at
the
torture
the
man
was
in
well
sir
you
may
go
said
the
page
and
i
would
recommend
you
and
your
brother
to
lie
very
private
there
must
be
no
more
evasion
when
he
was
gone
chiffinch
turned
to
me
well
he
said
what
do
you
think
oh
i
think
he
speaks
the
truth
in
the
main
i
said
wearily
shall
i
be
needed
any
more
or
when
may
i
leave
town
you
must
wait
mallock
until
we
have
laid
hands
on
them
it
was
not
until
the
middle
of
july
that
i
was
able
to
leave
on
the
eighteenth
of
june
a
proclamation
was
issued
with
the
names
of
some
of
the
conspirators
and
numerous
arrests
were
made
one
matter
pleased
me
a
little
and
that
was
that
keeling
had
been
man
enough
after
all
to
warn
some
of
the
humbler
folk
who
had
been
led
into
the
affair
of
what
he
had
done
and
the
most
of
these
got
clean
away
then
sheppard
came
forward
and
betrayed
three
or
four
who
had
met
in
his
house
as
i
had
seen
for
myself
and
west
added
many
details
a
second
proclamation
containing
the
names
and
offering
rewards
for
the
arrest
of
monmouth
my
lord
grey
sir
thomas
armstrong
and
the
reverend
robert
ferguson
was
made
after
my
lord
russell
arrest
but
all
four
of
them
escaped
my
lords
howard
and
essex
were
taken
on
the
tenth
of
july
and
two
days
later
walcot
hone
and
rouse
were
convicted
as
soon
as
my
lord
russell
trial
was
begun
and
the
certainty
that
he
would
be
convicted
was
made
plain
by
my
lord
howard
turning
evidence
i
left
london
with
my
man
james
and
before
we
were
at
dover
the
news
came
to
us
that
my
lord
essex
in
despair
had
cut
his
throat
in
the
tower
as
for
myself
i
was
glad
enough
to
leave
for
i
was
both
sick
and
weary
of
intrigue
it
would
be
of
a
very
different
sort
in
france
and
of
a
kind
that
a
gentleman
may
undertake
without
misgivings
so
though
i
was
loth
to
leave
the
land
where
dolly
was
the
balance
altogether
left
me
refreshed
rather
than
saddened
it
was
a
clear
day
as
the
packet
put
out
from
dover
and
as
i
stood
on
deck
watching
the
cliffs
recede
as
we
went
there
came
on
me
again
that
same
mood
that
had
fallen
on
me
as
i
went
up
the
river
so
long
ago
from
wapping
once
more
it
appeared
to
me
as
if
i
were
in
somewhat
of
a
dream
those
men
i
had
left
behind
awaiting
trial
and
death
chiffinch
the
king
the
court
even
dolly
herself
appeared
to
have
something
about
them
once
more
the
realities
seemed
to
close
about
me
and
envelop
me
or
rather
that
great
reality
whom
we
name
god
and
all
else
seemed
but
very
little
and
trifling
part
iv
chapter
i
once
more
it
was
high
summer
a
year
afterwards
as
i
rode
in
still
with
james
thank
god
and
three
other
men
over
london
bridge
my
life
abroad
once
more
must
remain
undescribed
there
is
plenty
of
reason
against
the
telling
of
it
and
nothing
at
all
for
it
one
thing
only
may
i
say
that
i
came
last
from
rome
having
stayed
over
for
the
feast
of
the
apostles
and
carried
with
me
though
verbally
only
some
very
particular
instructions
for
his
royal
highness
the
duke
of
york
from
personages
whom
he
should
respect
if
he
did
not
and
what
those
counsels
were
will
appear
in
the
proper
place
by
those
same
personages
i
had
been
complimented
very
considerably
and
urged
to
yet
greater
efforts
briefly
with
regard
to
the
two
royal
brothers
i
was
urged
to
press
on
the
one
and
to
restrain
the
other
for
i
heard
in
rome
that
it
was
said
that
they
would
listen
to
me
if
i
observed
discretion
as
to
what
had
passed
in
england
a
very
short
account
will
suffice
first
with
regard
to
the
conspirators
a
number
had
been
executed
among
whom
i
suppose
must
be
reckoned
my
lord
russell
an
upright
man
i
think
yet
one
who
had
at
least
played
with
very
hot
fire
frankly
i
do
not
believe
that
he
aimed
ever
at
the
king
life
but
that
my
lord
howard
witnessed
that
he
did
in
order
to
save
himself
of
the
others
that
were
executed
i
think
all
deserved
it
and
the
principal
i
suppose
was
sidney
that
ancient
republican
and
commonwealth
man
who
was
undoubtedly
guilty
besides
him
my
lord
essex
had
killed
himself
in
prison
for
i
never
believed
the
ugly
story
of
the
bloody
razor
having
been
thrown
out
of
his
window
and
sir
thomas
armstrong
was
executed
and
richly
he
had
earned
it
by
a
thousand
crimes
and
debaucheries
and
old
colonel
rumbald
whose
fate
i
must
allow
caused
me
a
little
sorrow
even
though
he
had
flung
a
sharp
cleaver
at
my
head
for
he
was
very
much
more
of
a
man
than
that
puling
treacherous
hound
my
lord
howard
who
was
taken
hiding
in
his
shirt
up
his
own
chimney
and
turned
traitor
to
his
friends
holloway
too
a
merchant
of
bristol
and
a
friend
of
ferguson
was
executed
and
several
in
edinburgh
of
the
scottish
plotters
under
argyle
among
whom
the
principal
was
baillie
of
jerviswood
the
torture
of
the
boot
and
the
thumbscrews
was
used
there
i
am
sorry
to
say
for
they
had
plenty
of
evidence
without
it
of
the
others
some
evaded
altogether
of
whom
a
good
number
went
to
holland
which
was
their
great
refuge
at
this
time
and
others
again
saved
their
lives
by
turning
king
evidence
the
reverend
ferguson
proved
himself
a
clever
fellow
as
indeed
i
had
thought
him
and
a
courageous
one
too
for
after
attending
my
lord
shaftesbury
upon
his
deathbed
he
returned
again
to
edinburgh
and
there
upon
search
being
made
for
him
hid
himself
in
the
very
prison
to
which
they
wished
to
consign
him
and
so
escaped
the
death
he
had
earned
with
regard
to
the
duke
of
monmouth
affairs
had
taken
a
very
strange
course
and
his
majesty
as
i
think
had
behaved
with
less
than
his
usual
wisdom
before
even
sidney
death
the
duke
had
made
his
peace
both
with
the
king
and
the
duke
of
york
and
had
after
expressing
extraordinary
contrition
and
yet
denying
that
he
had
been
in
any
way
privy
to
any
attempt
on
the
king
life
received
a
pardon
but
he
had
not
been
content
with
that
and
so
soon
as
the
announced
that
it
was
so
and
had
given
men
to
understand
that
monmouth
had
made
his
peace
by
turning
king
evidence
what
must
his
grace
do
but
deny
it
again
and
cause
it
to
be
denied
too
in
all
the
in
town
the
king
was
thrown
into
a
passion
by
this
and
once
again
his
grace
had
to
sign
and
read
aloud
a
paper
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
and
of
the
king
in
the
private
parlour
of
the
duchess
of
portsmouth
lodgings
where
it
must
be
confessed
his
majesty
did
much
of
his
business
at
this
time
but
the
paper
was
not
explicit
enough
and
must
be
and
so
the
foolish
went
on
and
he
guilty
all
the
time
and
at
last
he
evaded
them
all
and
went
back
again
to
holland
there
was
another
piece
of
news
that
had
come
to
me
lately
that
pleased
me
better
and
that
was
of
the
trial
of
oates
for
treasonous
speaking
and
his
condemnation
in
one
hundred
thousand
pounds
which
caused
him
to
be
shut
up
in
prison
without
more
ado
where
he
could
do
no
more
mischief
indeed
his
credit
was
all
gone
now
thank
god
and
all
that
he
had
to
do
in
prison
was
to
prepare
himself
for
his
whippings
which
he
got
a
year
later
a
few
months
earlier
too
the
four
popish
lords
that
had
been
left
in
the
tower
were
released
again
which
i
was
very
glad
to
hear
of
other
matters
too
had
passed
but
i
think
i
have
said
enough
to
shew
how
affairs
stood
in
the
month
of
july
when
i
came
back
to
england
with
the
exception
of
what
i
shall
relate
presently
as
of
my
own
experience
the
evening
was
as
bright
and
fair
as
that
on
which
i
had
come
back
to
london
near
two
years
and
a
half
ago
with
so
heavy
a
heart
to
find
dolly
at
court
but
this
time
the
heaviness
was
all
gone
i
had
had
letters
from
her
continually
and
all
those
i
carried
with
me
she
told
me
that
her
father
seemed
a
little
moody
now
and
again
but
i
did
not
care
very
greatly
about
that
he
could
be
as
moody
as
he
liked
if
he
but
let
her
and
me
alone
it
was
less
than
a
year
now
from
my
birthday
which
was
the
period
that
had
been
fixed
now
a
piece
of
news
had
reached
me
at
dover
that
made
me
pretty
content
and
that
was
that
his
majesty
desired
me
to
have
lodgings
now
in
whitehall
these
were
very
hard
to
come
by
except
a
man
had
great
influence
and
i
was
happy
to
think
that
such
as
i
had
was
from
the
king
himself
so
i
did
not
return
northwards
this
time
from
the
strand
but
held
on
and
so
to
the
gate
of
whitehall
here
i
was
stopped
and
asked
my
name
i
gave
it
and
the
officer
saluted
me
very
civilly
your
lodgings
are
ready
sir
said
he
chiffinch
was
very
urgent
about
them
and
he
bade
me
tell
you
you
would
find
visitors
there
if
you
came
before
eight
it
was
now
scarcely
gone
seven
but
i
thought
very
little
of
my
visitors
supposing
they
might
perhaps
be
chiffinch
himself
and
a
friend
so
i
inquired
very
leisurely
where
the
lodgings
were
situate
they
are
my
lord
peterborough
old
lodgings
sir
said
the
man
he
hath
moved
elsewhere
they
look
out
upon
the
privy
garden
and
the
or
to
be
more
close
on
the
trees
between
them
this
was
a
fine
piece
of
news
indeed
for
these
lodgings
were
among
the
best
i
was
indeed
become
a
person
of
importance
there
were
two
entrances
to
these
lodgings
one
from
the
stone
gallery
and
the
other
from
the
garden
but
that
into
the
garden
was
only
a
little
door
whose
use
was
not
greatly
encouraged
because
of
the
personages
that
walked
there
so
i
went
up
the
stone
gallery
between
all
the
books
and
the
cabinets
and
so
to
my
own
door
with
my
james
behind
me
my
other
men
i
bade
follow
when
they
had
bestowed
the
horses
and
found
their
own
quarters
it
was
a
fine
entrance
with
a
new
shield
over
the
door
lately
scraped
white
for
the
reception
of
my
own
arms
i
knocked
upon
it
and
a
fellow
opened
and
when
i
had
told
him
my
name
he
let
me
through
and
i
went
upstairs
to
the
parlour
that
looked
over
the
garden
and
there
to
my
happiness
were
my
visitors
for
they
were
none
other
than
my
dear
love
herself
and
her
maid
i
can
not
tell
what
that
was
to
me
to
find
her
there
the
maid
was
sent
into
the
little
next
door
into
which
my
visitors
would
usually
be
shewn
and
we
two
sat
down
on
the
dolly
looked
not
a
day
older
she
was
in
a
fine
dress
see
she
said
you
have
caught
me
again
at
court
will
you
send
me
away
again
this
time
she
told
me
presently
that
she
and
her
father
were
come
up
to
town
for
a
few
days
but
must
be
gone
again
directly
they
had
written
to
chiffinch
demanding
news
of
me
and
when
should
i
be
at
liberty
to
come
to
hare
street
and
he
had
told
them
that
at
anyrate
not
yet
for
a
while
and
that
they
had
best
come
and
see
me
in
my
new
lodgings
i
was
sorry
that
he
had
said
i
could
not
go
to
hare
street
for
the
present
though
i
had
expected
no
less
but
i
soon
forgot
it
again
in
her
dear
presence
you
are
a
great
man
now
i
suppose
she
said
presently
too
great
to
see
to
the
pigs
any
longer
we
have
no
such
rooms
as
this
at
hare
street
they
were
indeed
fine
and
we
went
through
them
together
they
were
all
furnished
from
roof
to
floor
there
were
some
good
tapestries
and
pictures
and
the
windows
as
the
officer
had
said
looked
out
for
the
most
part
upon
the
trees
beneath
which
so
long
ago
i
had
watched
ladies
walking
but
i
told
her
that
i
loved
my
panelled
chamber
at
hare
street
and
the
little
parlour
with
the
poor
knights
of
the
grail
who
rode
there
for
ever
and
never
attained
their
quest
more
than
all
whitehall
then
i
kissed
her
again
for
perhaps
the
thirtieth
time
and
as
i
was
doing
so
cousin
tom
came
in
ah
said
he
i
have
caught
you
then
but
he
said
it
without
much
merriment
if
dolly
was
no
older
her
father
was
there
were
grey
hairs
in
his
eyebrows
for
that
was
all
that
i
could
see
of
his
hair
since
he
wore
a
periwig
and
his
face
appeared
a
little
blotchy
i
met
him
however
with
cordiality
and
congratulated
him
on
his
looks
he
sat
down
and
presently
to
my
astonishment
he
too
opened
out
upon
my
prospects
though
in
a
very
different
manner
from
dolly
you
are
a
great
man
now
he
said
in
these
fine
lodgings
i
wonder
his
majesty
hath
not
made
you
at
least
a
knight
i
was
a
little
angry
at
his
manner
he
said
it
not
pleasantly
at
all
but
as
if
he
found
fault
i
determined
i
would
not
meet
his
ambitions
at
all
my
dear
cousin
said
i
indeed
i
am
not
a
knight
and
have
no
hope
of
being
so
his
majesty
hath
a
thousand
men
more
competent
than
i
then
why
hath
he
given
you
these
lodgings
said
he
with
a
sharp
look
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
i
am
of
some
convenience
to
his
majesty
and
the
more
so
if
i
am
near
him
i
suppose
that
these
lodgings
fell
vacant
in
the
nick
of
time
he
looked
at
me
very
earnestly
he
had
of
course
no
idea
of
in
what
matters
i
was
engaged
i
might
have
been
a
mere
valet
for
all
he
knew
that
is
so
he
said
i
have
no
reason
to
think
otherwise
i
answered
him
well
it
was
growing
late
and
i
had
not
supped
as
dolly
presently
remembered
it
was
near
eight
and
after
that
time
there
would
be
formalities
at
the
gate
as
they
went
out
so
they
took
their
leave
at
last
and
i
kissed
dolly
for
the
time
and
went
downstairs
with
them
and
watched
them
down
the
gallery
they
having
promised
to
come
again
next
day
i
had
scarcely
done
supper
and
looked
about
me
a
little
when
chiffinch
name
was
brought
to
me
and
i
went
to
see
him
in
the
little
parlour
and
bring
him
through
to
what
would
be
my
private
closet
so
great
was
i
become
he
looked
older
and
i
told
him
so
well
so
i
am
said
he
and
so
are
we
all
you
will
be
astonished
when
you
see
his
majesty
is
he
so
much
older
i
asked
he
has
aged
five
years
in
one
said
he
we
talked
presently
after
looking
through
my
lodgings
again
to
see
if
all
were
as
it
should
be
and
after
my
thanking
chiffinch
for
the
pains
he
had
put
himself
to
first
of
france
and
then
of
rome
he
shewed
himself
very
astute
when
we
spoke
of
rome
i
do
not
wish
to
pry
he
said
but
i
hope
to
god
sake
that
the
holy
father
hath
given
you
a
commission
to
his
royal
highness
to
bid
him
hold
himself
more
quiet
he
will
ruin
all
if
he
be
not
careful
why
how
is
that
said
i
ah
you
ecclesiastics
he
cried
for
i
count
you
half
an
one
at
least
in
spite
of
your
pretty
cousin
you
are
more
close
than
any
of
us
well
i
will
tell
you
as
if
you
did
not
know
he
put
his
fingers
together
in
his
old
manner
first
said
he
he
is
lord
high
admiral
again
i
count
that
very
rash
we
are
protestants
we
english
you
know
and
we
like
not
a
papist
to
be
our
you
will
have
to
put
up
with
a
papist
as
a
king
some
day
said
i
why
i
suppose
so
though
i
would
not
have
been
so
sure
two
years
ago
but
a
king
is
another
matter
from
an
high
admiral
well
what
else
has
he
done
i
asked
he
hath
been
readmitted
to
the
council
in
the
very
face
of
the
test
act
too
but
it
is
how
he
bears
himself
and
speaks
that
is
the
worst
of
all
he
carries
himself
and
his
religion
as
openly
as
he
can
and
does
all
that
is
in
his
power
to
relieve
the
papists
of
disabilities
that
is
very
courageous
i
know
but
it
is
not
very
shrewd
god
knows
where
he
will
stop
if
once
he
is
on
the
throne
i
think
he
will
not
be
there
long
i
said
nothing
for
indeed
my
instructions
were
on
those
very
points
and
i
knew
them
all
as
well
as
chiffinch
and
i
think
better
he
spoke
presently
of
myself
as
for
you
mallock
i
need
not
tell
you
how
high
you
are
in
favour
here
monumentum
requiris
and
he
waved
his
hands
at
the
rich
rooms
his
majesty
is
very
good
i
said
his
majesty
hath
a
peerage
for
you
if
you
want
it
he
said
he
had
made
too
many
grocers
and
lickspittles
into
knights
to
make
you
one
i
can
not
deny
that
to
hear
that
news
pleased
me
yet
even
then
i
hesitated
chiffinch
said
i
at
last
if
you
mean
what
you
say
i
have
something
to
answer
to
that
well
said
he
let
me
have
one
year
more
of
obscurity
i
may
be
able
to
do
much
more
that
way
in
one
year
from
now
i
shall
be
married
as
i
told
you
well
when
i
have
a
wife
she
must
come
to
town
and
make
acquaintances
and
so
i
shall
be
known
in
any
case
let
me
have
it
then
if
i
want
it
as
a
wedding
gift
so
that
she
shall
come
as
my
lady
and
i
will
do
what
i
can
then
in
his
majesty
service
more
publicly
what
if
his
majesty
is
dead
before
that
said
he
regarding
me
closely
then
we
will
go
without
said
i
he
nodded
and
said
no
more
it
was
strange
to
lie
down
that
night
in
a
great
room
with
four
posts
and
all
their
hangings
about
me
with
my
lord
peterborough
arms
emblazoned
on
the
ceiling
and
to
know
that
it
was
indeed
i
roger
mallock
who
lay
there
with
a
man
within
call
and
a
coronet
if
i
would
have
it
within
reach
it
was
not
till
then
i
think
that
i
understood
how
swift
had
been
my
rise
for
here
was
i
but
just
years
old
and
in
england
but
the
better
part
of
six
years
yet
even
then
more
than
half
my
thoughts
were
of
dolly
and
of
how
she
would
look
in
a
peeress
robes
i
even
determined
what
my
title
should
be
taken
from
my
french
estates
in
the
village
of
malmaison
in
normandy
so
foolish
and
trifling
are
a
man
thoughts
at
such
a
time
one
thing
however
i
resolved
and
that
was
to
say
nothing
at
all
of
all
this
either
to
dolly
or
her
father
it
should
be
a
wedding
gift
to
the
one
and
a
consolation
to
the
other
for
dearly
would
my
cousin
tom
love
to
speak
of
his
the
viscount
or
even
the
plain
lord
malmaison
as
for
his
majesty
death
before
another
year
i
thought
nothing
of
that
for
what
young
man
of
years
of
age
thinks
ever
that
anyone
will
die
even
should
he
die
too
which
i
prayed
god
might
not
be
yet
there
was
his
royal
highness
to
follow
and
i
had
served
him
all
things
considered
pretty
near
as
well
as
his
brother
so
then
i
lay
in
thought
hearing
a
fountain
play
somewhere
without
my
windows
and
the
rustle
of
the
wind
in
the
limes
that
stood
along
the
privy
garden
i
heard
midnight
strike
from
the
at
the
further
end
of
the
palace
before
i
slept
and
presently
after
the
cry
of
the
watchman
that
all
was
well
and
a
fair
night
chapter
ii
it
was
not
until
the
third
day
after
my
coming
to
town
that
i
had
audience
of
the
duke
in
the
evening
after
supper
having
bidden
that
morning
with
a
very
heavy
heart
to
my
cousins
at
aldgate
whither
i
had
escorted
them
i
had
promised
dolly
i
would
come
when
i
could
but
god
knew
when
that
would
be
even
by
then
i
think
i
had
become
accustomed
to
my
new
surroundings
i
had
made
no
friends
indeed
for
that
was
expressly
contrary
to
my
desires
since
a
man
on
secret
service
must
be
very
slow
to
do
so
but
i
had
made
a
number
of
acquaintances
even
in
that
short
time
and
had
renewed
some
others
i
had
had
a
word
or
two
with
sir
george
jeffreys
now
a
long
time
lord
chief
justice
in
scroggs
old
place
and
found
him
a
very
brilliant
kind
of
man
of
an
extraordinary
handsomeness
and
no
less
extraordinary
power
not
at
all
brutal
in
manner
as
i
had
thought
but
liker
to
a
very
bright
sword
at
once
sharp
and
heavy
and
sharp
and
heavy
indeed
men
found
him
when
they
looked
at
him
from
the
dock
it
was
in
chiffinch
closet
that
i
was
made
known
to
him
i
had
spoken
too
with
my
lord
halifax
another
brilliant
fellow
very
satirical
and
witty
for
which
the
king
loved
him
though
all
the
world
guessed
and
the
king
i
think
knew
that
his
opposition
to
our
cause
was
so
hot
as
even
to
keep
him
in
correspondence
with
the
duke
of
monmouth
safe
away
in
holland
at
least
that
was
the
talk
in
the
he
like
the
lord
keeper
north
hated
a
papist
like
the
devil
and
all
his
ways
and
wishes
he
said
of
my
lord
rochester
now
made
president
of
the
council
a
post
of
immense
dignity
and
no
power
at
all
that
he
was
kicked
upstairs
which
was
a
very
precise
description
of
the
matter
i
was
taken
straight
through
into
the
duke
private
closet
where
he
awaited
me
and
by
the
rarest
chance
his
majesty
was
just
about
to
take
his
leave
and
they
had
me
in
before
he
was
gone
i
was
very
deeply
shocked
by
his
majesty
appearance
he
was
standing
below
a
pair
of
candles
when
i
came
in
and
his
face
was
all
in
shadow
but
when
after
i
had
saluted
the
two
he
moved
out
presently
i
could
see
how
fallen
his
face
was
and
how
heavily
lined
since
it
was
evening
too
and
he
had
not
shaved
since
morning
i
could
see
a
little
frostiness
as
it
were
upon
his
chin
he
dyed
his
eyebrows
and
moustaches
i
suppose
for
these
were
as
black
as
ever
his
melancholy
eyes
had
a
twinkle
in
them
as
he
looked
at
me
well
said
he
so
here
is
our
hero
back
again
come
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
rising
sun
i
suppose
but
he
said
it
very
pleasantly
without
any
irony
why
sir
said
i
i
have
always
understood
that
there
is
neither
rising
nor
setting
with
england
sun
but
that
it
is
always
in
the
king
never
dies
and
the
king
can
do
no
wrong
such
was
the
manner
in
which
we
spoke
at
court
in
those
days
very
foolish
and
bombastic
no
doubt
hark
to
that
brother
said
the
king
there
is
a
pretty
compliment
to
us
both
it
is
to
neither
of
us
that
mallock
is
loyal
but
to
the
crown
only
it
is
that
which
we
all
serve
sir
said
i
even
your
majesty
the
king
smiled
well
he
said
i
must
be
off
while
you
two
plot
i
suppose
come
and
see
me
too
mallock
when
you
have
done
all
your
duties
i
took
him
to
the
door
of
the
closet
where
the
servants
were
waiting
for
him
and
even
his
gait
seemed
to
me
older
now
james
had
very
little
though
no
stuart
could
have
none
of
his
family
charm
he
looked
no
older
no
sharper
and
no
lighter
than
a
year
ago
and
he
had
learned
nothing
from
adversity
as
i
presently
understood
he
very
graciously
made
me
sit
down
but
in
even
that
the
condescension
was
evident
not
as
his
brother
did
it
you
have
been
to
rome
again
he
said
pretty
soon
when
he
had
told
me
how
he
did
and
how
the
king
was
not
so
well
as
he
had
been
and
what
news
do
you
bring
with
you
i
told
him
first
of
the
holy
father
health
and
delivered
a
few
compliments
from
one
or
two
of
the
cardinals
and
spoke
of
three
or
four
general
matters
of
the
court
there
he
nodded
and
asked
some
questions
but
i
could
see
that
he
was
thinking
of
something
else
but
you
have
more
to
say
to
me
have
you
not
said
he
i
had
a
letter
from
the
cardinal
secretary
he
paused
yes
sir
said
i
the
holy
father
was
graciously
pleased
to
put
me
at
your
royal
highness
disposal
if
you
should
wish
to
know
his
mind
on
one
or
two
affairs
i
put
it
like
this
as
gently
as
i
could
for
indeed
i
had
something
very
like
a
scolding
in
my
pocket
for
him
he
saw
through
it
however
for
he
lowered
his
eyelids
a
little
sullenly
as
his
way
was
when
he
was
displeased
well
let
us
hear
it
said
he
what
have
i
done
wrong
now
this
would
never
do
his
royal
highness
resembled
a
mule
in
this
at
least
that
the
harder
he
was
pushed
the
more
he
kicked
and
jibbed
he
must
be
drawn
forward
by
some
kind
of
a
carrot
if
he
were
to
be
moved
i
made
haste
to
draw
out
my
finest
his
holiness
is
inexpressibly
consoled
i
said
by
your
royal
highness
zeal
for
religion
and
courage
too
in
that
course
he
bade
me
tell
you
that
he
could
say
his
if
he
could
but
see
such
zeal
and
obedience
in
the
rest
of
europe
the
duke
smiled
a
little
and
i
could
see
that
he
was
pleased
it
was
really
necessary
to
speak
to
him
in
this
manner
he
would
have
resented
any
such
freedom
or
informality
as
i
used
towards
the
king
these
are
the
sweets
before
the
medicine
he
said
and
now
for
the
draught
sir
i
said
there
is
no
draught
there
is
but
a
word
of
warning
his
holiness
well
call
it
what
you
will
what
is
it
mr
mallock
i
told
him
then
as
gently
as
i
could
interlarding
all
with
a
great
many
compliments
that
his
holiness
was
anxious
that
matters
should
not
go
too
fast
that
there
was
still
a
great
deal
of
disaffection
in
england
and
that
though
the
pendulum
had
swung
it
would
surely
swing
back
again
though
please
god
never
so
far
as
it
had
been
and
that
meantime
a
great
deal
of
caution
should
be
used
for
example
it
was
a
wonderful
thing
that
his
royal
highness
should
be
lord
high
admiral
of
the
fleet
again
but
that
great
care
should
be
observed
lest
the
people
should
be
frightened
that
a
papist
should
have
the
guarding
of
them
or
again
that
the
test
act
should
be
set
aside
in
his
royal
case
yet
the
exception
should
not
be
pressed
too
far
all
this
my
lord
cardinal
howard
had
expressly
told
me
but
there
was
one
yet
more
difficult
matter
to
speak
of
and
this
i
reserved
for
the
moment
well
said
the
duke
when
i
had
got
so
far
i
am
obliged
to
his
holiness
for
his
solicitude
and
i
shall
give
the
advice
my
closest
attention
was
there
anything
more
mr
mallock
he
had
received
it
i
thought
with
unusual
humility
so
i
made
haste
to
bring
out
the
last
of
what
i
had
to
say
there
is
no
more
sir
i
said
in
substance
there
was
only
that
his
eminence
thought
perhaps
that
the
extraordinary
courage
and
fervour
of
your
royal
highness
jesuit
advisers
led
them
to
neglect
discretion
a
little
ah
his
eminence
thought
that
did
he
said
james
meditatively
his
eminence
had
said
it
a
great
deal
more
strongly
than
that
but
i
dared
not
put
it
as
he
had
yes
sir
i
said
they
are
largely
under
french
influence
and
french
circumstances
are
not
at
all
as
in
england
the
society
is
a
little
apt
at
present
then
the
duke
lost
his
and
his
heavy
face
lightened
with
a
kind
of
anger
mallock
he
said
you
have
said
enough
i
do
not
blame
you
at
all
but
his
eminence
with
all
possible
respect
to
him
does
not
know
what
he
is
talking
about
these
good
fathers
have
imperilled
their
lives
for
england
if
any
have
a
right
to
speak
it
is
they
and
i
would
sooner
listen
to
their
counsel
than
to
all
the
cardinals
in
christendom
they
know
england
as
rome
can
not
and
while
i
allow
myself
to
be
led
by
the
nose
by
no
man
living
i
would
sooner
do
what
they
advise
than
what
a
roman
cardinal
advises
it
is
not
by
subtlety
or
plotting
that
the
faith
will
be
commended
in
this
country
but
by
courageous
action
and
since
god
has
placed
me
here
in
the
position
that
i
hold
it
is
to
him
alone
that
i
must
answer
you
can
send
that
message
back
to
rome
sir
as
soon
as
you
like
now
there
was
james
true
to
himself
and
i
could
see
that
further
words
would
be
wasted
i
smoothed
him
down
as
well
as
i
could
and
i
was
happy
to
see
that
it
was
not
with
myself
that
he
was
angry
for
he
made
that
very
plain
for
that
i
still
might
hope
he
would
listen
to
me
later
on
but
anything
further
at
that
time
was
useless
so
i
prepared
to
take
my
leave
and
he
made
no
opposition
well
sir
he
said
you
have
given
your
message
very
well
and
i
thank
you
for
not
wrapping
it
up
you
have
done
very
well
in
france
i
hear
his
majesty
hath
been
pleased
to
think
so
i
said
then
his
face
lightened
again
ah
said
he
when
the
time
comes
we
shall
shew
europe
what
england
can
do
we
shall
astonish
even
rome
itself
i
think
we
have
long
been
without
the
light
but
it
is
dawning
once
more
and
when
the
sun
is
indeed
risen
as
his
majesty
said
men
will
be
amazed
at
us
we
shall
need
no
more
help
from
france
then
the
whole
land
will
be
a
garden
of
the
lord
his
face
itself
was
alight
with
enthusiasm
and
i
wondered
how
once
more
in
this
man
as
in
many
others
the
church
shewed
itself
able
to
inspire
and
warm
yet
without
that
full
moral
conversion
that
she
desires
he
was
not
yet
by
any
means
free
from
the
sins
of
the
flesh
and
from
pride
which
two
things
so
commonly
go
together
he
could
not
be
released
from
these
until
humiliation
should
come
on
him
as
it
did
and
made
him
very
like
a
saint
before
the
end
meanwhile
it
was
something
to
thank
god
for
that
he
should
be
so
and
zealous
even
though
he
lacked
discretion
as
i
was
going
down
the
stairs
whom
should
i
run
into
coming
up
but
father
huddleston
who
stopped
to
speak
with
me
i
did
not
know
him
very
well
though
i
had
talked
with
him
once
or
twice
he
was
the
one
priest
of
english
blood
who
was
tolerated
openly
and
legally
in
england
and
who
had
leave
to
wear
his
habit
for
his
saving
of
the
king
life
after
the
battle
of
worcester
so
you
are
home
again
mallock
he
said
in
his
cheery
voice
i
told
him
yes
and
that
i
was
come
for
a
good
time
and
his
majesty
he
said
have
you
seen
him
he
is
terribly
aged
is
he
not
this
last
year
this
priest
was
a
very
fellow
going
on
for
sixty
years
old
i
would
say
and
except
for
his
dress
resembled
some
fine
old
he
wore
a
great
brown
periwig
that
set
off
his
rosy
face
he
was
not
i
think
a
very
spiritual
man
though
good
and
conscientious
and
he
meddled
not
at
all
with
politics
or
even
with
religion
he
went
his
way
and
let
men
alone
which
though
not
very
apostolic
is
at
least
very
prudent
and
peaceful
he
was
fond
of
country
sports
i
had
heard
and
of
the
classics
and
spent
his
time
pretty
equally
in
them
both
yes
said
i
the
king
is
a
year
older
since
this
time
twelvemonth
he
laughed
loudly
there
speaks
the
courtier
he
said
and
you
come
from
the
duke
i
told
him
yes
and
i
go
to
him
well
good
day
to
you
mr
mallock
it
was
very
pleasant
to
me
this
new
air
in
which
i
lived
here
was
i
come
from
the
duke
who
had
received
me
as
never
before
with
a
deference
if
the
duke
behaviour
to
any
man
could
be
called
that
such
as
he
had
never
shewn
me
being
greeted
too
by
this
priest
who
up
to
this
time
had
never
manifested
much
interest
in
me
going
back
to
my
fine
lodgings
and
my
servants
indeed
it
was
a
great
change
as
i
went
past
the
sentry
a
minute
or
two
later
he
saluted
me
and
i
returned
it
feeling
very
happy
that
i
was
come
to
be
of
some
consideration
at
last
with
do
much
more
too
in
the
background
of
which
others
never
dreamed
i
had
my
first
audience
of
his
majesty
a
week
later
and
confirmed
my
impressions
of
his
ageing
very
rapidly
he
received
me
with
extraordinary
kindness
but
as
to
the
first
part
of
the
interview
since
this
concerned
private
affairs
in
france
i
shall
give
no
description
it
was
the
end
only
that
was
of
general
interest
and
one
part
of
it
very
particular
since
i
was
able
to
speak
my
mind
to
him
again
he
was
standing
looking
out
of
the
window
when
he
said
his
last
word
on
france
and
kept
silent
a
little
he
stood
as
upright
as
ever
but
there
was
an
air
in
him
as
if
he
felt
the
weight
of
his
years
though
they
were
scarcely
in
number
his
hand
nearest
to
me
hung
down
listlessly
with
the
lace
over
it
when
he
spoke
he
put
into
words
the
very
thing
that
i
was
thinking
i
am
getting
an
old
man
mallock
he
said
suddenly
turning
on
me
and
i
would
that
affairs
were
better
settled
than
they
are
they
are
better
than
they
were
i
do
not
dispute
that
but
these
endless
little
matters
distress
me
why
can
not
folk
be
at
peace
and
charitable
one
with
another
i
said
nothing
but
i
knew
of
what
he
was
thinking
it
was
the
old
business
of
religion
which
so
much
entered
into
everything
and
distorted
men
judgments
for
he
had
just
been
speaking
of
his
grace
of
monmouth
why
can
not
men
serve
god
according
to
their
own
conscience
he
said
and
leave
others
to
do
the
same
sir
i
said
there
is
but
one
church
of
god
where
men
are
at
unity
with
one
another
he
paid
no
attention
to
that
and
his
face
suddenly
contracted
strangely
did
you
hear
any
gossip
i
mean
about
myself
after
the
death
of
the
jesuit
fathers
i
told
him
no
for
i
had
heard
nothing
of
it
at
that
time
he
came
and
sat
down
motioning
me
too
to
a
seat
for
i
had
stood
up
when
he
did
well
he
said
it
is
certainly
strange
enough
and
i
should
not
have
believed
it
if
it
had
not
happened
to
myself
again
he
stopped
with
an
odd
look
well
he
said
here
is
the
tale
and
i
will
swear
to
it
you
know
how
unwilling
i
was
to
sign
the
yes
sir
all
the
world
knows
that
and
all
the
world
knows
that
i
did
it
he
said
with
a
vehement
kind
of
bitterness
yes
i
did
it
for
there
was
no
way
out
of
it
that
i
could
see
it
was
they
or
the
crown
must
go
but
i
never
intended
it
and
i
swore
i
would
not
yes
sir
i
said
quietly
you
said
so
to
me
did
i
well
i
said
so
to
many
i
even
swore
that
my
right
hand
might
rot
off
if
i
did
it
his
heavy
face
was
all
working
i
had
seldom
seen
him
so
much
moved
yes
he
said
that
was
what
i
swore
well
mallock
did
you
ever
hear
what
followed
no
sir
i
said
again
it
was
within
that
week
that
when
i
awakened
one
morning
i
felt
my
right
hand
to
be
all
stiff
i
thought
nothing
of
it
at
the
first
i
believed
i
must
have
strained
it
at
tennis
well
that
day
i
said
nothing
to
anyone
but
i
rubbed
some
ointment
on
my
hand
that
night
he
stopped
again
lifted
his
right
hand
a
little
and
looked
at
it
as
if
meditating
on
it
it
was
a
square
strong
man
hand
but
very
well
shaped
and
very
brown
it
had
a
couple
of
great
rings
on
the
fingers
well
he
said
the
next
morning
a
sore
had
broken
out
on
it
and
i
sent
for
a
physician
he
told
me
it
was
nothing
but
a
little
humour
in
the
blood
and
he
bade
me
take
care
of
my
diet
i
said
nothing
to
anyone
else
and
bade
him
not
speak
of
it
and
that
night
i
put
on
some
more
ointment
and
the
next
morning
another
sore
was
broken
out
between
the
finger
and
the
thumb
so
that
i
could
not
hold
a
pen
without
pain
and
it
was
then
for
the
first
time
that
i
remembered
what
i
had
sworn
he
had
his
features
under
command
again
but
i
could
see
as
he
looked
at
me
that
his
eyes
were
still
full
of
emotion
well
mallock
i
was
in
a
great
way
at
that
but
yet
i
dared
tell
nobody
i
wore
my
glove
all
day
so
that
no
one
should
see
my
hand
and
that
evening
when
i
went
in
to
see
her
majesty
what
should
i
see
hanging
up
on
the
wall
of
the
chamber
but
the
pictures
of
the
five
men
whose
warrants
i
had
signed
once
more
he
stopped
now
i
remembered
that
i
had
heard
a
little
gossip
as
to
the
king
hand
about
that
time
but
it
had
been
so
little
that
i
had
thought
nothing
of
it
it
was
very
strange
to
hear
it
all
now
from
himself
well
sir
he
said
i
am
not
ashamed
to
say
what
i
did
i
kissed
their
pictures
one
by
one
and
i
begged
them
to
intercede
for
me
the
next
morning
mallock
the
sores
were
healed
up
and
the
morning
after
the
stiffness
was
all
gone
i
said
nothing
for
what
could
i
say
it
is
true
enough
that
many
might
say
that
it
had
all
fallen
out
so
by
chance
that
it
was
no
more
than
a
strain
at
tennis
or
a
humour
in
the
blood
as
the
physician
had
thought
but
i
did
not
think
so
nor
i
think
would
many
catholics
you
say
nothing
mallock
said
the
king
what
is
there
to
say
sir
asked
i
what
indeed
he
cried
again
with
the
greatest
emotion
there
is
nothing
at
all
to
say
the
facts
are
as
i
have
said
then
there
came
upon
me
once
more
that
passionate
desire
to
see
this
strange
and
restless
soul
at
peace
of
those
who
have
never
received
the
gift
of
faith
i
say
nothing
god
will
be
their
judge
and
i
doubt
not
their
saviour
if
they
have
but
been
faithful
to
what
they
know
but
for
those
who
have
received
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
and
have
drawn
back
from
it
i
have
always
feared
very
greatly
now
that
his
majesty
had
received
this
light
long
before
this
time
i
had
never
had
any
doubt
indeed
it
had
been
reported
though
i
knew
falsely
that
he
had
submitted
to
the
church
and
been
taken
into
her
communion
while
he
was
yet
a
young
man
in
france
yet
here
he
was
still
holding
back
from
what
he
knew
to
be
true
and
growing
old
too
as
he
had
said
all
this
went
through
my
mind
but
before
i
could
speak
he
was
up
again
an
instant
mallock
he
said
as
i
rose
up
with
him
and
he
turned
swiftly
towards
the
door
that
was
behind
him
and
was
out
through
it
leaving
it
open
behind
him
from
where
i
stood
i
could
see
what
he
did
there
was
a
great
press
in
the
little
chamber
next
door
and
he
flung
the
doors
of
this
open
so
that
i
could
see
him
pull
forward
his
that
lay
within
this
he
opened
with
a
key
that
he
carried
hung
on
a
chain
and
fumbled
in
it
a
minute
or
two
drawing
out
at
last
a
paper
and
so
bearing
this
and
leaving
the
open
just
as
it
was
he
came
back
to
me
look
at
that
mallock
said
he
it
was
a
sheet
of
paper
written
very
closely
in
his
majesty
own
hand
and
was
headed
in
capital
letters
then
there
followed
a
set
of
reasons
all
numbered
shewing
that
the
holy
roman
church
was
none
other
than
the
very
church
of
christ
outside
of
which
there
is
no
salvation
it
was
made
public
later
as
all
the
world
knows
so
i
need
not
set
it
out
here
in
full
there
sir
he
said
when
i
had
done
reading
it
what
do
you
think
of
that
i
shall
never
forget
how
he
looked
when
i
lifted
my
eyes
and
regarded
him
he
was
standing
by
the
window
with
the
light
on
his
face
and
there
was
an
extraordinary
earnestness
and
purpose
in
his
features
it
was
near
incredible
that
this
could
be
the
man
whom
i
had
seen
so
careless
with
his
ladies
so
light
and
indolent
but
there
are
many
sides
to
every
man
as
i
have
learned
in
a
very
long
life
sir
i
cried
what
am
i
to
say
there
is
nothing
that
i
can
add
this
is
your
majesty
own
conscience
written
out
in
ink
i
tapped
the
paper
with
my
finger
still
holding
it
eh
said
he
and
by
conscience
god
judges
us
all
i
cried
again
i
stared
into
his
eyes
and
he
into
mine
your
majesty
will
have
to
answer
to
this
said
i
on
judgment
day
i
could
say
no
more
so
great
was
my
emotion
and
as
i
hesitated
a
change
went
over
his
face
his
brows
came
down
as
if
he
were
angry
but
his
lips
twitched
a
little
as
if
in
humour
there
there
he
said
give
me
the
paper
mr
mallock
i
gave
it
back
to
him
and
he
stood
running
his
eyes
down
it
why
this
is
damned
good
he
murmured
i
should
have
made
a
theologian
and
with
that
i
knew
that
his
mood
was
changed
again
and
that
i
could
say
no
more
chapter
iii
i
do
not
know
which
is
the
more
strange
that
when
a
great
time
of
trial
approaches
a
man
either
he
has
some
kind
of
a
premonition
that
trouble
is
coming
upon
him
or
that
he
has
not
certainly
it
is
strange
enough
that
some
sense
of
which
we
know
nothing
should
scent
danger
when
there
are
no
outward
signs
that
any
is
near
but
it
appears
even
more
strange
to
me
that
the
storm
should
break
all
of
a
sudden
without
any
cloud
in
the
sky
to
shew
its
coming
it
was
the
latter
case
with
me
and
the
storm
came
upon
me
as
i
shall
now
relate
it
was
now
for
the
first
time
that
i
began
to
see
something
of
the
way
the
court
lived
i
mean
as
one
who
was
himself
a
part
of
it
i
had
looked
on
it
before
rather
as
a
spectator
at
a
show
observing
the
pageants
pass
before
me
but
myself
from
the
nature
of
my
employment
taking
no
part
in
it
from
within
a
great
deal
that
i
saw
was
very
dreadful
and
unchristian
many
of
the
persons
resembled
hogs
and
monkeys
more
than
human
beings
and
a
great
deal
of
what
passed
for
wit
and
merriment
was
nothing
other
than
pure
evil
virtue
was
very
little
reckoned
of
or
rather
reckoned
only
as
giving
additional
zest
to
its
own
corruption
i
do
not
mean
that
there
were
no
virtuous
people
at
all
there
were
virtuous
people
in
sodom
and
gomorrah
themselves
but
they
were
unusual
and
were
looked
upon
as
a
little
freakish
or
mad
yet
for
all
that
side
by
side
with
the
evil
there
went
on
a
great
deal
of
seemliness
and
religion
sermons
were
preached
before
the
court
every
sunday
and
his
majesty
who
by
his
own
life
was
greatly
responsible
for
the
wickedness
around
him
went
to
at
least
three
or
four
times
in
the
week
though
i
can
not
say
that
his
behaviour
there
accorded
very
well
with
the
business
he
was
engaged
upon
some
blamed
the
bishops
and
other
ministers
for
their
laxity
and
the
flattery
that
they
shewed
to
his
majesty
but
i
do
not
think
that
charge
is
a
fair
one
for
they
were
very
bold
indeed
upon
occasion
ken
who
preached
pretty
often
was
as
outspoken
as
a
preacher
well
could
be
denouncing
the
sins
of
the
court
in
unmeasured
language
even
in
his
majesty
presence
and
a
certain
bishop
whose
name
i
forget
observing
on
one
occasion
during
that
the
king
was
fast
asleep
turned
and
rebuked
in
a
loud
voice
some
other
gentleman
who
was
asleep
too
you
snore
so
loudly
sir
he
cried
that
you
will
awake
his
majesty
if
you
do
not
have
a
care
i
went
sometimes
to
the
chapel
with
the
crowd
to
hear
the
anthem
as
the
custom
was
for
the
music
was
extraordinary
good
and
no
expense
spared
and
i
heard
there
some
very
fine
motets
the
most
of
which
were
adapted
from
the
old
catholic
music
and
set
to
new
words
taken
from
the
protestant
scripture
i
went
one
night
in
august
to
the
duke
theatre
as
it
was
called
to
see
a
play
of
sir
charles
sedley
called
mulberry
this
extraordinary
man
with
whom
i
had
already
talked
on
more
than
one
occasion
was
according
to
one
account
the
loosest
man
that
ever
lived
and
indeed
the
tales
related
of
him
are
such
that
i
could
not
even
hint
at
them
in
such
a
work
as
this
but
he
was
now
about
years
old
and
a
thought
steadier
it
chanced
that
he
and
my
lord
dorset
who
was
of
the
same
reputation
but
had
fought
too
both
by
land
and
sea
were
present
with
ladies
of
whom
the
duchess
of
cleveland
was
one
in
one
of
the
boxes
that
looked
upon
the
stage
and
i
was
astonished
at
the
behaviour
of
them
all
sedley
himself
who
appeared
pretty
drunk
was
the
noisiest
person
in
the
house
he
laughed
loudly
at
any
of
his
own
lines
that
took
his
fancy
and
conversed
equally
loudly
with
his
friends
when
they
did
not
as
for
the
play
it
was
of
a
very
poor
kind
and
gave
me
no
pleasure
at
all
for
there
was
but
one
subject
in
it
from
beginning
to
end
and
that
was
the
passion
which
the
author
would
call
love
there
were
lines
too
in
it
of
the
greatest
coarseness
and
at
these
he
laughed
the
loudest
he
had
a
sharp
bold
face
of
an
extraordinary
insolence
and
he
appeared
to
take
the
highest
delight
in
the
theme
of
his
play
which
he
had
written
for
the
king
theatre
a
good
while
before
and
which
concerned
nothing
else
but
the
of
two
maids
that
had
an
fop
for
a
father
when
the
play
was
over
and
i
going
out
to
my
little
coach
that
i
used
i
found
that
the
duchess
of
cleveland
coach
stopped
the
way
in
spite
of
the
others
waiting
behind
and
her
grace
not
come
however
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
and
i
waited
presently
out
they
came
sedley
leading
the
way
with
great
solemnity
who
knocked
against
me
as
i
stood
there
and
asked
what
the
devil
i
did
in
his
road
i
saluted
them
as
ironically
as
i
could
and
begged
his
pardon
i
had
no
idea
sir
charles
said
i
that
the
theatre
and
street
were
yours
as
well
as
the
play
he
looked
at
me
as
if
he
could
not
believe
his
ears
but
my
lord
dorset
who
was
just
behind
came
up
and
took
him
by
the
arm
he
is
right
he
said
mallock
is
quite
right
beg
his
pardon
i
tell
you
why
the
devil
began
sir
charles
again
still
not
recognizing
me
my
lord
clapped
him
sharply
on
his
hat
driving
it
over
his
eyes
he
is
blind
now
mallock
he
said
in
every
sense
you
would
not
be
angry
with
a
blind
man
when
sir
charles
had
got
his
hat
straight
again
he
was
now
angry
with
my
lord
dorset
and
very
friendly
and
apologetic
to
myself
whom
i
suppose
he
had
remembered
by
now
so
the
two
drove
away
presently
after
the
ladies
still
disputing
loudly
but
i
think
my
lord
behaviour
shewed
me
more
than
ever
that
i
was
become
a
person
of
some
consequence
yet
this
kind
of
manners
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
though
it
commended
gentlemen
as
well
known
as
were
those
two
to
the
ruder
elements
among
the
spectators
who
laughed
and
shouted
did
a
great
deal
of
harm
in
those
days
to
the
court
and
the
king
among
the
more
serious
and
sober
persons
of
the
country
and
it
is
these
who
in
the
long
run
always
have
the
ordering
of
things
god
knows
i
would
not
live
in
a
puritanical
country
if
i
could
help
it
yet
decent
breeding
is
surely
due
from
gentlemen
a
week
or
two
later
i
was
at
a
in
her
majesty
apartments
and
had
a
clearer
sight
than
ever
of
the
relations
between
the
king
and
queen
now
his
majesty
had
behaved
himself
very
ill
to
the
queen
he
had
flaunted
his
mistresses
everywhere
and
had
even
compelled
her
to
receive
them
he
had
neglected
her
very
grossly
yet
i
must
say
in
his
defence
that
there
was
one
line
he
would
not
pass
he
would
not
on
any
account
listen
to
those
advisers
of
his
who
from
time
to
time
had
urged
him
to
put
her
away
by
divorce
and
marry
a
protestant
who
might
bear
him
children
even
my
lord
bishop
of
salisbury
burnet
had
thirteen
or
fourteen
years
ago
given
as
his
opinion
that
a
barren
wife
might
be
divorced
and
even
that
polygamy
was
not
contrary
to
the
new
testament
this
however
charles
had
flatly
refused
to
countenance
and
when
he
thought
of
it
now
and
again
shewed
her
a
sort
of
compassionate
kindness
in
spite
of
his
distaste
for
her
company
yet
his
very
compassionateness
proved
his
distaste
it
was
on
occasion
of
a
reception
by
her
majesty
of
some
moorish
deputation
or
embassage
from
tangier
that
i
was
present
in
her
apartments
and
it
was
immediately
after
this
too
so
that
i
have
good
cause
to
remember
it
that
the
first
completely
unexpected
reverse
came
to
my
fortunes
i
arrived
at
her
majesty
lodgings
about
nine
in
the
evening
and
was
pleased
to
see
that
the
yeomen
of
the
guard
lined
the
staircase
up
to
the
great
gallery
this
was
an
honour
which
the
queen
did
not
very
often
enjoy
and
very
fine
they
looked
in
their
scarlet
and
gold
with
their
halberds
all
the
way
up
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
the
great
gallery
when
i
came
into
it
was
tolerably
full
of
people
of
whom
i
spoke
to
a
good
number
among
whom
again
were
sir
charles
sedley
and
my
lord
dorset
as
usual
inseparable
but
i
was
very
much
astonished
at
the
manner
in
which
the
moors
were
treated
for
they
were
seated
on
couches
on
one
side
of
the
state
under
which
her
majesty
sat
as
if
they
were
some
kind
of
set
there
to
be
looked
at
they
were
extraordinary
rich
and
barbaric
in
their
appearance
and
when
i
had
kissed
her
majesty
hand
i
too
went
and
looked
with
the
rest
of
the
crowd
who
jostled
all
together
to
stare
at
them
they
were
in
very
gorgeous
silks
and
wore
turbans
and
their
jewels
were
beyond
anything
that
i
had
ever
seen
great
uncut
emeralds
and
red
stones
of
which
i
did
not
know
the
name
and
ropes
of
pearls
the
folks
about
me
bore
themselves
with
an
amazing
insolence
regarding
them
as
if
they
had
been
monsters
and
freely
making
comments
on
them
which
their
interpreter
at
least
must
have
understood
the
moors
themselves
behaved
with
great
dignity
and
it
was
impossible
not
to
reflect
that
these
shewed
a
far
higher
degree
of
dignity
and
civilization
than
did
my
own
countrymen
they
were
very
and
three
or
four
of
them
of
a
wonderful
handsomeness
they
sat
there
almost
in
silence
looking
gravely
at
the
crowd
and
observing
i
thought
with
surprise
the
bare
shoulders
and
bosoms
of
the
ladies
who
stared
and
screamed
as
much
as
any
it
appeared
to
me
that
these
poor
moors
too
thought
that
the
civilization
lay
principally
upon
their
own
side
i
presently
felt
ashamed
of
myself
for
looking
at
them
and
turned
away
the
gallery
and
the
antechambers
had
some
fine
furniture
in
them
pushed
against
the
walls
that
the
crowd
might
circulate
but
all
was
not
near
so
fine
as
the
duchess
of
portsmouth
apartments
nor
even
as
the
king
the
cressets
i
saw
most
of
them
were
of
brass
not
silver
the
brocades
which
were
portuguese
were
a
little
faded
here
and
there
and
there
was
not
near
the
show
of
gold
and
silver
plate
that
i
had
expected
but
of
all
the
sights
there
i
think
her
majesty
was
the
most
melancholy
she
was
dressed
very
splendid
and
her
skirt
was
so
stiff
with
bullion
that
it
scarce
fell
in
folds
at
all
her
pearls
were
magnificent
but
too
many
of
them
for
her
was
full
of
them
she
resembled
to
my
mind
a
sorrowful
child
dressed
up
for
a
play
her
complexion
was
very
dark
and
faded
though
her
features
were
all
except
her
mouth
she
was
a
little
like
a
very
pretty
monkey
if
such
a
thing
can
be
conceived
she
sat
under
her
state
with
an
empty
chair
beside
her
very
upright
with
the
countess
of
suffolk
and
her
other
ladies
round
about
her
and
behind
her
she
appeared
altogether
ill
at
ease
and
eyed
continually
down
the
length
of
the
gallery
along
which
his
majesty
would
come
if
indeed
he
came
at
all
for
he
had
a
way
of
sending
a
sudden
message
that
he
could
not
and
all
the
world
knew
where
he
would
be
instead
however
he
kept
his
word
and
came
i
was
in
one
of
the
antechambers
at
the
time
talking
to
a
couple
of
gentlemen
and
to
one
of
the
queen
portuguese
chaplains
who
knew
a
little
italian
when
i
heard
the
music
playing
and
ran
out
in
time
to
see
him
go
past
from
the
way
that
led
from
his
own
lodgings
he
seemed
in
a
very
merry
mood
this
evening
and
was
smiling
as
he
walked
very
fast
as
usual
he
was
in
a
dark
yellow
and
gold
brocade
that
set
off
the
darkness
of
his
complexion
wonderful
well
and
a
dark
brown
periwig
with
his
hat
upon
it
and
he
wore
his
garter
and
star
the
crowd
closed
in
behind
his
gentlemen
so
that
i
could
not
get
near
him
and
when
i
came
up
he
was
on
his
chair
by
her
majesty
and
she
smiling
and
tremulous
with
happiness
and
the
moors
coming
up
one
by
one
to
kiss
his
hand
i
could
not
hear
very
well
what
the
interpreter
was
saying
when
all
this
was
done
but
i
heard
him
speak
of
a
gift
of
thirty
ostriches
that
this
moorish
mission
had
brought
as
a
gift
to
him
his
majesty
laughed
loud
when
he
heard
that
i
can
send
nothing
more
proper
back
again
said
he
than
a
flock
of
geese
i
have
enough
and
to
spare
of
them
then
when
all
about
were
laughing
he
turned
very
solemn
you
had
best
not
tell
them
that
he
said
or
they
might
take
some
of
my
friends
away
with
them
in
mistake
this
was
pretty
fooling
but
it
scarce
struck
me
as
suited
to
the
dignity
of
the
occasion
presently
the
interpreter
was
saying
how
consumed
with
loyal
envy
were
these
moors
at
all
the
splendour
that
they
saw
about
them
it
is
better
to
be
envied
than
pitied
observed
his
majesty
with
a
very
serious
look
at
first
be
bore
himself
with
extraordinary
geniality
this
evening
he
had
been
drinking
a
little
i
think
yet
not
at
all
to
excess
for
this
he
never
did
though
he
had
no
objection
to
others
doing
so
in
his
company
there
was
related
of
him
i
remember
how
the
lord
mayor
once
after
a
city
banquet
pressed
his
majesty
very
unduly
to
remain
a
little
longer
after
he
had
risen
up
to
go
his
majesty
was
already
at
the
door
when
the
mayor
did
this
even
venturing
for
he
was
pretty
far
gone
in
wine
to
lay
his
fingers
on
the
king
arm
his
majesty
looked
at
him
for
an
instant
and
then
burst
out
laughing
ah
well
he
said
quoting
the
old
song
that
is
drunk
is
as
great
as
a
king
and
he
went
back
and
drank
another
bottle
he
was
in
that
merry
kind
of
mood
then
this
evening
but
such
moods
have
their
reactions
and
half
an
hour
later
he
was
beginning
first
to
yawn
behind
his
hand
and
then
to
wear
a
heavy
look
on
his
face
her
majesty
observed
it
too
as
i
could
see
for
she
fell
silent
which
was
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
to
do
and
began
to
eye
him
sidelong
with
a
kind
of
dismay
it
was
wonderful
how
little
knowledge
she
had
of
how
to
manage
him
and
how
she
shewed
to
all
present
what
she
was
feeling
presently
he
was
paying
no
more
attention
to
her
at
all
but
was
leaning
back
in
his
chair
listening
to
my
lord
dorset
who
was
talking
in
his
ear
and
nodding
and
smiling
rather
heavily
sometimes
i
felt
very
sorry
for
the
queen
but
i
had
best
have
been
feeling
sorry
for
myself
for
it
was
now
that
all
unknown
to
me
a
design
was
maturing
against
me
though
not
from
my
lord
dorset
as
i
was
about
to
turn
away
to
go
once
more
through
the
rooms
before
taking
my
leave
i
observed
chiffinch
coming
through
very
fast
from
the
direction
of
the
king
apartments
as
if
he
had
some
message
he
did
not
observe
me
as
i
was
within
the
crowd
but
i
saw
him
go
up
threading
his
way
as
well
as
he
could
and
touching
one
or
two
to
make
them
move
out
of
his
way
straight
up
to
the
king
side
of
the
state
i
thought
he
would
pause
then
but
he
did
not
he
put
his
hand
on
my
lord
dorset
shoulder
from
behind
and
made
him
give
way
and
then
he
took
his
place
and
began
to
whisper
to
his
majesty
i
saw
his
majesty
frown
once
or
twice
as
if
he
were
displeased
and
then
glance
quickly
up
at
the
faces
before
him
and
down
again
as
if
he
looked
to
see
if
someone
were
there
but
i
did
not
know
that
it
was
for
me
that
he
looked
then
the
king
nodded
thrice
sharply
chiffinch
whispering
all
the
while
and
then
he
leaned
over
and
whispered
to
the
queen
then
both
of
them
stood
up
the
king
looking
heavier
than
ever
and
the
queen
very
near
fit
to
cry
and
both
came
down
front
the
dais
together
all
the
company
saluting
them
and
making
way
and
so
they
went
down
the
gallery
together
i
was
still
staring
after
him
wondering
what
was
the
matter
when
i
felt
myself
touched
and
turned
to
find
chiffinch
at
my
elbow
he
looked
very
serious
come
this
way
sir
said
he
i
must
speak
with
you
instantly
i
went
after
him
down
the
gallery
and
he
led
me
into
the
little
empty
chamber
where
i
had
been
talking
with
the
priest
half
an
hour
ago
he
closed
the
door
carefully
behind
him
and
turned
to
me
again
mallock
he
said
i
have
very
serious
news
for
you
yes
said
i
never
dreaming
what
the
matter
was
it
touches
yourself
very
closely
he
said
searching
my
face
with
his
eyes
well
what
is
it
asked
i
my
heart
beginning
to
beat
a
little
mallock
he
said
very
gravely
there
is
an
order
for
your
arrest
if
you
will
come
back
with
me
quietly
to
my
lodgings
we
can
effect
all
that
is
necessary
without
scandal
chapter
iv
i
said
never
a
word
as
we
went
back
first
downstairs
between
the
yeomen
then
to
the
right
and
so
round
through
the
little
familiar
passage
and
up
the
stairs
i
could
hear
the
tramp
of
guards
behind
and
knew
that
they
had
followed
us
from
the
queen
lodgings
and
would
be
at
the
doors
after
we
were
within
i
was
completely
stunned
except
i
think
for
a
little
glimmer
of
sense
still
left
which
told
me
that
the
least
said
in
any
public
place
the
better
chiffinch
too
i
could
see
very
well
was
as
bewildered
as
myself
for
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
there
was
not
yet
the
faintest
suspicion
in
my
mind
as
to
what
was
the
matter
at
least
i
told
myself
my
conscience
was
clear
so
soon
as
we
were
within
the
closet
the
page
having
again
shut
the
door
carefully
behind
me
came
forward
to
where
i
stood
sit
down
mallock
said
he
in
a
low
voice
but
very
kindly
i
could
see
that
his
face
was
very
pale
and
that
he
seemed
greatly
agitated
when
i
was
seated
he
sat
himself
down
at
his
table
a
little
way
off
this
is
a
terrible
affair
he
said
and
i
do
not
know
for
god
sake
i
whispered
suddenly
tell
me
what
i
am
charged
with
he
looked
up
at
me
sharply
you
do
not
know
mr
mallock
before
god
i
said
i
have
no
more
idea
what
the
pother
is
about
than
well
shortly
he
said
it
is
treason
treason
why
he
leaned
forward
and
took
up
a
pen
to
play
with
as
be
talked
i
will
tell
you
the
whole
thing
from
the
beginning
he
said
you
must
have
patience
an
hour
ago
a
clerk
came
to
me
here
from
the
board
of
the
green
cloth
to
tell
me
that
the
magistrates
desired
my
presence
there
immediately
on
a
matter
of
the
highest
importance
i
went
there
directly
and
found
three
or
four
of
them
there
with
sir
george
jeffreys
whom
they
had
sent
for
it
seemed
as
they
did
not
know
what
course
to
pursue
and
had
thought
perhaps
that
i
might
throw
some
light
upon
it
they
were
very
grave
indeed
and
presently
mentioned
your
name
saying
that
a
charge
had
been
laid
against
you
before
one
of
the
westminster
magistrates
of
having
been
privy
to
the
ryehouse
plot
why
cried
i
with
sudden
relief
he
held
up
his
hand
wait
he
said
i
too
laughed
when
i
heard
that
and
gave
them
to
understand
on
what
side
you
had
been
throughout
that
matter
and
how
you
had
been
in
his
majesty
service
and
that
i
myself
was
privy
to
every
detail
of
the
affair
they
looked
more
easy
at
that
and
i
thought
that
all
was
over
but
they
asked
me
to
look
at
papers
they
had
of
yours
papers
of
mine
i
cried
yes
mallock
papers
of
yours
i
will
tell
you
presently
how
they
came
by
them
well
there
were
about
a
dozen
i
suppose
altogether
and
some
of
them
i
knew
all
about
and
said
so
these
were
notes
and
reports
that
you
had
shewed
to
me
and
there
were
three
or
four
more
which
though
i
had
not
seen
them
i
could
answer
for
but
there
was
one
mallock
that
i
could
not
understand
at
all
he
paused
and
looked
at
me
and
i
could
see
that
he
was
uneasy
now
it
may
appear
incredible
but
even
then
i
could
not
think
of
what
paper
he
meant
to
the
best
of
my
belief
i
had
shewn
him
everything
that
i
thought
to
be
of
the
least
importance
notes
and
reports
as
he
had
said
such
as
was
that
which
i
had
made
in
the
wherry
on
my
way
up
from
wapping
one
night
i
shook
my
head
i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
i
said
where
did
they
get
the
papers
from
think
again
mallock
i
said
it
was
on
a
charge
of
treason
just
now
well
i
will
say
now
that
it
may
be
no
more
than
misprision
of
treason
still
i
had
no
suspicion
i
was
thinking
still
i
suppose
of
my
lodgings
here
in
whitehall
and
of
a
few
papers
i
had
there
you
must
tell
me
i
said
mallock
he
said
this
paper
i
speak
of
was
in
cypher
it
contained
lord
i
cried
cousin
tom
then
i
bit
my
lip
but
it
was
too
late
yes
said
the
other
very
gravely
i
can
see
that
you
remember
it
was
your
cousin
who
brought
them
up
from
hare
street
he
found
them
all
in
a
little
and
conceived
it
to
be
his
duty
his
duty
i
cried
good
god
why
then
again
i
checked
myself
chiffinch
said
i
i
remember
the
paper
perfectly
at
least
i
remember
that
i
had
it
though
i
have
never
read
it
or
thought
anything
of
it
it
is
in
very
easy
cypher
sir
said
he
with
some
severity
well
it
was
too
hard
for
me
i
said
then
why
did
you
not
shew
it
to
me
he
asked
lord
man
i
said
i
tell
you
it
was
gone
clean
from
my
memory
i
got
it
from
rumbald
a
great
while
ago
a
year
or
two
at
the
least
before
the
plot
it
was
on
my
mind
to
send
it
to
you
but
i
did
not
i
had
no
idea
that
it
was
of
the
least
importance
a
letter
in
cypher
and
from
rumbald
and
you
thought
it
of
no
importance
even
though
the
names
of
my
lord
shaftesbury
and
half
a
dozen
others
are
written
in
full
i
tell
you
i
forgot
it
i
said
sullenly
for
i
had
not
looked
for
suspicion
from
this
man
he
still
looked
at
me
as
if
searching
my
face
and
i
suppose
that
i
presented
the
very
picture
of
an
unmasked
villain
for
the
whole
affair
was
so
surprising
and
unexpected
that
i
was
completely
taken
aback
well
he
said
if
you
had
but
shewn
me
that
paper
we
could
have
forestalled
the
whole
affair
what
was
in
it
i
asked
striving
to
control
myself
you
tell
me
you
do
not
know
he
asked
then
indeed
i
lost
control
of
myself
i
stood
up
chiffinch
i
said
i
see
that
you
do
not
believe
a
word
that
i
say
it
will
be
best
if
you
take
me
straight
to
those
who
have
authority
to
question
me
he
did
not
move
you
had
best
sit
down
again
mallock
i
do
not
say
that
i
do
not
believe
you
but
i
will
allow
that
i
do
not
know
what
to
think
you
are
a
very
shrewd
man
sir
and
it
truly
is
beyond
my
understanding
that
you
should
have
forgotten
so
completely
this
most
vital
matter
i
wish
to
be
your
friend
but
i
confess
i
do
not
understand
oh
sit
down
man
he
cried
suddenly
do
not
playact
with
me
just
answer
my
questions
i
sat
down
again
i
saw
that
he
was
sincere
and
that
indeed
he
was
puzzled
and
my
anger
went
well
i
said
i
suppose
it
may
be
difficult
let
me
tell
you
the
whole
affair
so
i
told
him
i
related
the
whole
of
my
adventure
in
the
inn
and
how
i
got
the
paper
and
tried
to
read
it
and
could
not
then
how
i
took
it
to
hare
street
and
put
it
where
he
had
described
then
how
i
very
nearly
had
asked
a
jesuit
priest
if
he
had
any
skill
in
cypher
and
then
how
once
more
it
had
all
slipped
my
mind
and
that
a
long
time
having
elapsed
even
when
rumbald
became
prominent
again
even
then
i
had
not
remembered
it
that
is
absolutely
the
whole
tale
i
said
and
i
know
no
more
than
the
dead
what
it
is
all
about
what
is
it
all
about
mr
chiffinch
he
drew
a
breath
and
then
expelled
it
again
and
at
the
same
time
stood
up
withdrawing
his
eyes
from
my
face
i
think
it
was
then
for
the
first
time
that
he
put
away
his
doubts
for
i
had
got
my
wits
back
again
and
could
talk
reasonably
well
he
said
we
had
best
be
off
at
once
and
see
what
they
say
where
to
asked
i
why
to
his
majesty
lodgings
he
said
i
fetched
him
out
to
tell
him
did
you
not
see
me
his
majesty
i
cried
why
yes
i
thought
it
best
else
it
would
have
meant
your
arrest
mr
mallock
i
must
confess
that
my
uneasiness
came
back
which
had
left
me
just
now
as
i
went
with
the
page
to
the
king
lodgings
more
especially
when
i
saw
again
how
the
guards
fell
in
behind
us
and
followed
us
every
step
of
the
way
it
was
very
well
to
say
that
i
should
have
been
arrested
if
such
and
such
a
thing
had
not
happened
the
truth
was
i
was
already
under
arrest
as
i
should
soon
have
found
if
i
had
attempted
to
run
away
it
seemed
to
me
somewhat
portentous
too
that
his
majesty
was
so
ready
to
see
us
instead
of
mocking
at
the
whole
tale
at
once
chiffinch
said
nothing
to
me
as
we
went
i
think
he
himself
was
fully
convinced
of
my
innocence
at
least
of
any
deliberate
treachery
but
not
so
convinced
that
others
would
be
and
that
he
was
considering
how
he
should
put
my
case
it
was
a
sad
humiliation
for
me
this
trudging
along
like
a
schoolboy
going
to
be
whipped
with
a
couple
of
guards
following
to
see
that
i
did
not
evade
it
we
went
straight
upstairs
through
the
antechamber
and
to
the
door
of
the
private
closet
i
heard
voices
talking
there
one
of
which
cried
to
come
in
as
the
page
knocked
then
we
entered
i
had
thought
to
find
his
majesty
alone
or
very
nearly
so
and
i
was
astonished
and
disconcerted
at
the
number
of
persons
that
were
there
the
king
himself
was
seated
beyond
his
great
table
with
the
rest
standing
about
him
five
in
number
on
his
right
was
sir
george
jeffreys
in
his
rich
suit
just
as
he
had
come
from
some
entertainment
his
handsome
face
flushed
with
wine
yet
none
the
less
full
of
wit
and
attention
the
officer
of
the
green
cloth
was
on
the
other
side
it
was
this
gentleman
business
to
deal
with
all
cases
within
his
jurisdiction
that
took
their
rise
in
whitehall
itself
and
a
couple
of
magistrates
beside
him
with
neither
of
whom
i
had
any
acquaintance
an
officer
whose
face
again
was
new
to
me
named
colonel
hoskyns
a
fellow
in
the
dress
of
his
majesty
lifeguards
stood
very
upright
beside
sir
george
jeffreys
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
a
sheaf
of
papers
lay
before
the
king
on
the
table
i
was
even
more
disconcerted
to
see
how
his
majesty
looked
an
hour
or
two
ago
he
had
been
smiling
and
gracious
now
he
wore
a
very
stern
look
on
his
face
he
made
no
sign
of
recognition
as
i
came
in
after
chiffinch
but
so
soon
as
the
door
was
shut
spoke
immediately
to
the
page
well
he
said
what
have
you
got
from
him
chiffinch
advanced
a
step
nearer
glancing
at
the
faces
that
all
looked
on
him
sir
he
said
i
am
convinced
there
has
been
nothing
more
than
an
indiscretion
then
the
king
shewed
how
angry
he
was
he
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
bah
he
cried
an
indiscretion
indeed
with
his
guilt
staring
him
in
the
face
there
was
a
murmur
from
the
others
and
colonel
hoskyns
gave
me
a
look
of
very
high
disdain
as
if
i
had
been
a
toad
or
a
serpent
for
myself
i
said
nothing
i
remained
with
my
eyes
down
once
or
twice
before
i
had
seen
his
majesty
in
this
very
mood
for
the
most
part
he
was
the
least
suspicious
man
i
had
ever
encountered
but
once
his
suspicion
was
awake
there
was
none
harder
to
persuade
so
he
had
been
with
his
grace
of
monmouth
on
two
or
three
occasions
so
it
appeared
he
was
to
be
with
me
now
sir
said
chiffinch
again
i
have
examined
mallock
very
closely
but
i
have
told
him
very
little
will
your
majesty
allow
him
to
hear
what
the
case
is
against
him
the
king
who
was
frowning
and
pursing
his
lips
raised
his
eyes
and
immediately
i
dropped
my
own
he
was
in
a
black
mood
indeed
and
all
the
blacker
for
his
past
kindness
to
me
tell
him
hoskyns
he
said
and
then
before
the
colonel
could
speak
he
addressed
me
directly
mallock
he
said
sharply
i
will
tell
you
plainly
why
i
have
you
here
and
why
you
are
not
in
ward
you
have
been
of
service
to
me
i
do
not
deny
that
and
i
have
never
known
you
yet
to
betray
your
trust
well
then
i
do
not
wish
to
disgrace
you
publicly
without
allowing
you
an
opportunity
of
speaking
and
clearing
yourself
if
that
is
possible
i
tell
you
frankly
i
do
not
think
you
will
i
see
no
loophole
anywhere
but
well
there
it
is
tell
him
hoskyns
i
will
not
deny
that
i
was
terrified
this
was
so
wholly
unlike
all
i
had
ever
known
of
his
majesty
what
in
the
world
could
be
the
case
against
me
for
i
now
saw
that
chiffinch
had
not
told
me
the
whole
but
only
a
part
of
the
charge
i
fixed
my
eyes
upon
hoskyns
for
whom
i
had
conceived
so
soon
as
i
had
set
eyes
on
him
an
extreme
repulsion
he
made
a
kind
of
apologetic
cringing
movement
towards
the
papers
the
king
made
no
movement
but
rested
heavily
in
his
chair
with
his
hat
forward
his
elbows
on
the
arms
of
his
chair
and
his
fingers
knit
beneath
his
chin
the
colonel
took
the
papers
up
shuffled
them
for
a
minute
and
then
began
there
was
an
extraordinary
malice
in
his
manner
which
i
could
not
understand
the
charge
against
the
the
gentleman
whose
name
i
understand
is
roger
mallock
consists
of
two
distinct
points
the
first
is
that
he
has
received
and
concealed
a
paper
containing
an
account
of
a
debate
held
between
certain
of
his
majesty
enemies
five
years
ago
in
november
of
sixteen
hundred
and
with
the
list
of
the
persons
present
and
the
votes
that
they
gave
as
regards
compassing
the
king
death
the
first
point
to
which
mallock
has
to
answer
is
how
he
came
to
be
in
possession
of
this
paper
at
all
i
made
a
movement
to
speak
as
his
voice
ceased
but
the
king
held
up
his
hand
then
as
if
by
an
afterthought
he
dropped
it
again
well
speak
if
you
like
point
by
point
but
i
would
recommend
you
to
hear
it
all
first
sir
i
said
i
have
no
reserves
and
nothing
to
conceal
i
will
answer
point
by
point
if
your
majesty
will
give
me
leave
he
said
nothing
i
turned
back
to
the
other
well
sir
i
said
i
had
that
paper
from
one
rumbald
in
a
private
parlour
in
the
inn
without
aldgate
he
gave
it
me
with
some
others
and
forgot
to
ask
for
it
again
no
one
moved
a
finger
or
a
feature
except
the
colonel
who
glanced
at
me
and
then
down
again
the
second
point
is
why
mallock
did
not
hand
over
the
paper
to
the
proper
authorities
again
he
paused
it
was
in
cypher
said
i
and
i
could
not
read
it
then
why
did
you
preserve
it
so
carefully
sir
asked
the
colonel
angrily
speaking
direct
to
me
for
the
first
time
i
preserved
it
because
it
might
be
of
interest
seeing
from
whom
i
received
it
you
preserved
it
then
because
it
might
be
of
interest
and
you
did
not
hand
it
over
because
it
might
not
sneered
the
colonel
come
come
said
the
king
sharply
we
must
have
a
better
answer
than
that
mr
mallock
then
my
heart
blazed
at
the
injustice
sir
i
said
i
am
telling
the
naked
truth
if
i
were
a
liar
and
a
knave
i
could
make
up
a
very
plausible
tale
no
doubt
but
i
am
not
the
naked
truth
is
that
i
preserved
the
paper
for
what
it
might
contain
and
then
i
paused
then
for
i
saw
plainly
what
a
very
poor
defence
i
had
and
then
sneered
the
colonel
softly
if
you
must
have
the
truth
i
said
i
forgot
all
about
it
well
it
was
as
i
thought
sir
george
jeffreys
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
aloud
he
was
a
man
of
extraordinary
freedom
with
the
king
a
great
grin
appeared
on
the
colonel
face
and
his
majesty
as
i
saw
in
the
shadow
beneath
his
hat
smiled
bitterly
showing
his
white
teeth
even
the
magistrates
chuckled
together
ah
sir
said
jeffreys
for
a
clever
man
that
is
truly
a
little
dull
you
might
have
done
better
than
that
then
desperation
seized
me
and
i
flung
all
prudence
to
the
winds
i
thought
you
wanted
the
truth
said
i
i
will
lie
if
you
drive
me
much
further
go
on
sir
i
cried
to
hoskyns
let
us
have
the
rest
the
king
stared
at
me
and
his
face
was
terrible
a
word
more
like
that
in
my
presence
sir
sir
i
cried
i
mean
no
disrespect
but
i
am
hard
put
to
it
you
are
indeed
said
jeffreys
go
on
colonel
hoskyns
the
colonel
sniffled
through
his
nose
lifting
his
papers
once
more
the
next
main
charge
against
mallock
is
even
more
grave
it
is
to
the
effect
that
when
his
majesty
and
his
royal
highness
were
together
at
newmarket
mallock
knowing
that
there
was
a
plot
against
their
lives
of
which
the
rye
was
the
centre
despatched
a
messenger
to
his
majesty
bidding
him
come
immediately
by
the
road
that
leads
past
the
rye
instead
of
directing
him
by
royston
at
that
monstrous
charge
my
spirit
almost
went
from
me
that
it
should
be
this
thing
above
all
others
that
should
be
brought
against
me
i
glanced
this
way
and
that
and
saw
how
even
chiffinch
who
had
fallen
back
a
little
as
i
advanced
was
looking
askance
at
me
that
is
perfectly
true
i
said
what
of
it
mallock
does
not
seem
to
perceive
snarled
the
colonel
that
the
fact
itself
is
enough
it
is
true
that
no
harm
came
of
it
but
mallock
will
scarcely
deny
that
an
armed
man
stood
by
him
waiting
for
the
coach
armed
with
a
cleaver
said
i
which
he
presently
flung
at
my
head
so
mallock
says
observed
the
colonel
you
say
i
am
a
liar
i
cried
the
king
struck
suddenly
upon
the
table
silence
sir
he
said
chiffinch
you
told
me
before
that
you
had
something
to
say
you
had
best
say
it
now
i
fell
back
for
i
saw
that
my
bolt
was
shot
if
chiffinch
could
not
save
me
no
man
could
it
was
gone
clean
beyond
mere
misprision
of
treason
now
i
saw
that
plain
enough
then
chiffinch
began
and
i
am
bound
to
say
that
he
shewed
himself
a
better
pleader
than
myself
i
thanked
god
as
he
spoke
that
i
had
treated
him
with
patience
just
now
in
his
lodgings
first
he
remarked
that
i
had
been
in
his
majesty
service
now
for
near
six
years
and
that
in
all
that
time
i
had
proved
myself
loyal
and
faithful
then
he
proceeded
to
deal
with
the
charges
first
he
said
that
the
very
weakness
of
my
excuse
with
regard
to
the
paper
was
my
strength
if
i
were
indeed
the
villain
that
i
seemed
why
in
god
name
had
i
not
destroyed
the
paper
i
had
had
near
five
years
to
do
it
in
was
not
that
an
additional
sign
that
i
had
as
i
said
merely
forgotten
it
as
be
said
this
i
marvelled
that
i
had
not
thought
of
that
answer
myself
it
was
true
that
the
paper
was
of
the
highest
importance
but
as
my
story
stood
i
had
not
known
that
should
not
my
word
then
be
taken
considering
all
the
other
services
i
had
done
to
his
majesty
with
regard
to
the
second
point
first
let
them
divest
their
minds
of
any
prejudice
caused
by
the
first
for
the
first
was
not
proved
having
done
that
it
was
necessary
to
remember
how
carefully
i
had
reported
every
movement
of
the
king
enemies
to
himself
chiffinch
it
was
true
that
there
had
been
found
other
papers
in
the
which
he
himself
had
not
seen
but
he
had
at
least
known
the
substance
of
them
except
of
course
of
the
cypher
of
which
he
had
already
treated
with
regard
to
the
affair
at
the
rye
it
was
necessary
to
remember
that
my
policy
throughout
had
been
to
report
all
that
i
had
learned
and
to
interpret
it
as
directly
contrary
to
the
truth
and
that
this
policy
had
proved
successful
i
saw
the
colonel
give
a
very
odd
look
as
this
was
said
and
i
saw
that
chiffinch
had
seen
it
too
at
the
worst
it
had
been
an
error
of
judgment
on
my
part
that
i
had
recommended
the
road
by
the
rye
but
it
was
an
error
that
had
had
no
bad
consequences
and
to
have
recommended
it
was
only
in
accordance
with
all
my
policy
of
taking
as
true
the
precise
opposite
to
all
that
the
conspirators
had
told
me
so
far
as
my
policy
was
sound
all
that
i
knew
was
that
the
rye
road
would
be
safe
on
that
one
day
of
the
royston
road
i
knew
little
or
nothing
as
regards
the
incident
of
the
cleaver
i
had
spoken
of
that
to
him
immediately
i
returned
to
town
and
surely
it
was
true
that
a
single
man
with
a
cleaver
could
do
very
little
damage
to
a
galloping
coach
in
short
though
the
evidence
might
be
interpreted
as
against
me
here
he
shot
a
look
at
the
colonel
it
might
also
be
interpreted
for
me
and
that
this
was
the
fairer
interpretation
he
pleaded
my
record
of
other
services
done
to
the
king
when
he
ended
there
was
a
dead
silence
and
i
think
i
knew
even
at
that
moment
that
the
worst
at
any
rate
had
been
averted
but
i
was
not
sure
and
i
waited
sir
george
jeffreys
was
the
first
to
move
he
had
remained
motionless
smiling
a
little
while
the
page
had
been
speaking
watching
him
as
a
man
may
watch
an
actor
who
pleases
him
at
the
end
after
a
little
pause
he
jerked
his
head
a
little
as
if
to
throw
off
the
situation
i
think
he
had
had
no
malice
to
me
but
had
watched
the
whole
affair
as
a
kind
of
sport
which
was
what
he
did
upon
the
bench
too
he
made
a
movement
as
if
to
move
away
but
remembered
where
he
was
and
stood
still
the
two
magistrates
began
to
move
also
and
one
nodded
at
the
other
colonel
hoskyns
shook
his
head
sharply
and
began
to
speak
he
began
in
his
harsh
voice
the
king
held
up
his
hand
and
all
was
dead
still
again
it
was
strange
to
me
to
watch
the
king
or
rather
to
shoot
a
glance
at
him
now
and
again
for
i
saw
presently
in
spite
of
the
shadow
of
his
hat
and
his
dusky
face
that
he
was
looking
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
as
if
appraising
what
had
been
said
i
heard
a
fellow
cough
somewhere
not
in
the
chamber
and
knew
by
that
that
it
was
the
guards
most
likely
who
were
waiting
for
the
verdict
truly
during
those
moments
all
my
confidence
left
me
again
for
this
was
a
mood
of
the
king
that
i
never
understood
and
had
never
seen
so
clearly
as
i
saw
it
now
it
was
a
sort
of
heaviness
of
mind
i
think
that
fell
on
him
sometimes
and
obscured
his
clear
wit
for
to
my
mind
nothing
could
be
more
plain
than
chiffinch
argument
yet
i
depended
now
not
only
for
my
liberty
but
for
my
very
life
on
the
king
judgment
as
a
catholic
and
a
member
of
the
secret
service
i
could
look
for
no
hope
at
all
if
i
were
sent
for
trial
i
looked
at
ramsden
the
officer
of
the
green
cloth
for
i
had
scarcely
noticed
him
before
so
quiet
was
he
it
was
through
his
hands
first
i
supposed
that
the
case
would
pass
he
was
still
motionless
looking
down
upon
the
table
then
the
king
spoke
not
moving
at
all
go
into
the
antechamber
mallock
he
said
dully
and
wait
there
till
you
be
sent
for
i
suppose
that
that
waiting
was
the
hardest
i
have
ever
done
again
my
suspense
came
down
on
me
and
i
had
no
idea
as
to
which
way
the
matter
would
go
i
sat
very
still
there
hearing
again
one
of
the
men
hemming
without
the
door
on
the
one
side
and
very
low
voices
talking
in
the
chamber
i
had
come
from
then
all
of
a
sudden
the
door
opened
sharply
and
chiffinch
came
through
he
smiled
and
nodded
though
a
little
doubtfully
as
he
came
through
and
my
heart
gave
a
great
leap
for
i
knew
that
the
worst
would
not
happen
to
me
he
said
nothing
but
beckoned
me
to
follow
and
we
went
straight
through
to
where
the
guards
wailed
you
can
go
he
said
this
gentleman
is
no
longer
under
arrest
still
all
the
way
as
we
went
he
said
nothing
neither
did
i
he
said
nothing
at
all
till
we
were
back
again
in
his
closet
and
the
door
shut
then
he
faced
me
smiling
well
mallock
he
said
his
majesty
has
determined
to
do
nothing
you
may
even
keep
your
lodgings
for
the
present
but
you
will
be
watched
i
need
not
tell
you
very
closely
indeed
and
you
must
expect
no
more
employment
for
a
while
but
wait
said
he
that
black
mood
is
on
his
majesty
and
you
are
very
fortunate
indeed
to
have
come
out
of
it
so
well
it
was
a
very
clever
little
design
design
cried
i
why
of
course
he
said
did
you
not
see
that
i
should
have
thought
anyone
design
i
said
again
of
whom
and
why
he
smiled
you
are
a
very
innocent
young
gentleman
he
said
in
spite
of
your
dexterity
of
course
it
was
a
design
and
it
nearly
deceived
even
me
my
cousin
tom
i
began
your
cousin
tom
is
an
ass
he
said
a
malicious
one
no
doubt
but
a
mere
tool
i
have
no
doubt
he
intended
to
injure
you
but
he
could
have
done
nothing
if
he
had
not
met
with
the
right
man
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
came
up
with
the
papers
and
gossiped
in
the
till
he
met
other
of
your
enemies
and
they
have
done
the
rest
but
it
was
colonel
hoskyns
no
doubt
who
manipulated
the
affair
colonel
hoskyns
i
said
why
i
have
never
set
eyes
on
the
man
before
i
daresay
not
said
the
page
still
smiling
but
i
have
had
his
name
in
my
books
for
a
great
while
who
is
he
i
cried
and
what
reason
had
he
chiffinch
shook
his
head
at
me
lamentably
why
he
is
one
of
the
party
he
said
though
i
can
get
no
evidence
that
would
hang
a
cat
i
have
no
doubt
whatever
that
he
has
been
in
the
whole
shaftesbury
affair
from
the
beginning
and
knows
that
they
made
shipwreck
principally
upon
yourself
it
is
sheer
revenge
now
no
doubt
for
they
can
not
hope
to
make
any
further
attempts
upon
his
majesty
but
he
is
in
the
guards
i
said
all
in
amazement
the
page
shrugged
his
shoulders
what
would
you
have
he
said
i
can
get
no
evidence
even
to
warn
his
majesty
though
i
have
told
him
what
i
think
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
believe
his
majesty
to
be
safe
enough
but
that
does
not
hinder
them
from
wishing
to
have
their
revenge
mallock
yes
i
said
still
all
bewildered
i
wonder
what
he
will
attempt
next
said
chiffinch
chapter
v
the
dreariness
of
the
time
that
followed
is
beyond
my
power
of
description
i
besought
chiffinch
to
let
me
go
abroad
again
but
he
forbade
me
very
emphatically
and
i
owed
so
much
to
him
that
i
could
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
disobey
for
so
desperate
was
i
at
the
ruin
of
all
my
hopes
that
the
thought
even
came
to
me
that
i
would
go
back
and
try
to
be
a
monk
again
for
how
thought
i
can
i
keep
my
word
even
to
dolly
herself
every
prospect
i
had
was
ruined
my
coronet
was
gone
like
the
dream
which
it
had
always
been
i
had
failed
lamentably
and
hopelessly
and
it
was
through
her
father
treachery
and
malice
that
all
had
come
about
this
i
felt
in
my
heaviest
moods
but
chiffinch
would
hear
none
of
it
he
said
that
it
was
but
a
question
of
time
and
his
majesty
would
come
round
once
more
that
he
would
never
be
content
until
i
was
reinstated
that
he
had
not
for
an
instant
lost
heart
besides
he
said
i
was
of
use
in
another
way
and
that
was
to
make
hoskyns
disclose
himself
hoskyns
would
never
rest
he
said
till
he
had
made
at
least
one
more
attempt
upon
me
and
next
time
he
hoped
he
would
catch
him
at
it
and
get
rid
of
the
fellow
once
and
for
all
neither
could
i
even
go
to
hare
street
for
how
could
i
live
again
even
for
an
hour
in
the
house
of
my
cousin
who
had
betrayed
me
i
could
not
even
tell
dolly
all
that
had
fallen
for
i
was
as
sure
as
of
anything
in
the
world
that
her
father
would
tell
her
nothing
and
i
did
not
have
the
heart
to
disgrace
him
in
her
eyes
i
but
wrote
to
her
that
i
was
a
little
out
of
favour
with
his
majesty
at
present
though
i
kept
my
lodgings
and
that
i
must
not
stir
from
court
till
i
had
regained
my
position
meanwhile
i
reserved
what
i
had
to
say
to
my
cousin
tom
until
i
should
meet
with
him
alone
i
had
no
doubt
whatever
that
he
had
done
what
he
had
thinking
to
get
rid
of
me
as
his
daughter
lover
the
time
dragged
then
very
heavily
for
i
did
not
care
to
go
much
into
the
society
of
others
and
had
nowhere
else
to
go
since
i
must
not
leave
whitehall
for
it
soon
became
known
that
i
was
out
of
favour
though
i
do
not
suppose
that
the
reason
was
ever
named
i
spent
my
days
principally
in
my
own
lodgings
and
did
a
good
deal
of
private
work
for
chiffinch
which
occupied
me
i
went
to
the
play
sometimes
taking
my
man
james
with
me
and
i
rode
out
with
him
usually
down
chelsea
way
or
to
the
north
coming
back
for
dinner
or
supper
i
never
went
alone
by
chiffinch
urgent
desire
it
was
after
christmas
that
matters
were
brought
to
a
head
and
that
the
last
great
adventures
of
my
life
came
about
that
closed
all
that
i
thought
to
be
life
at
that
time
even
now
so
many
years
after
i
can
scarce
bear
to
write
them
down
though
as
i
look
back
upon
them
now
there
were
at
least
two
matters
for
which
i
should
have
thanked
god
even
then
i
thank
him
now
it
was
on
the
last
thursday
but
one
in
january
to
be
precise
that
i
was
coming
back
from
a
ride
having
been
down
the
past
chelsea
where
i
had
seen
i
remember
winchester
house
that
great
place
with
all
its
courts
and
my
lord
bishop
returning
in
his
coach
i
do
not
remember
anything
else
that
i
saw
for
i
was
very
heavy
indeed
and
more
than
ever
determined
that
if
matters
did
not
mend
very
soon
i
would
be
off
to
france
where
six
months
later
i
should
be
obliged
to
go
in
any
case
when
my
estates
would
come
to
me
if
not
to
rome
it
was
near
five
months
now
that
i
had
lived
in
disgrace
his
majesty
not
speaking
to
me
above
three
or
four
times
all
that
while
and
then
only
to
avoid
incivility
i
could
not
understand
why
it
was
that
he
behaved
so
to
me
he
must
know
by
now
surely
that
i
had
never
been
anything
but
faithful
to
him
and
i
strove
to
put
away
the
thought
that
it
was
mere
caprice
and
that
he
often
behaved
so
to
others
but
i
am
afraid
that
such
was
the
case
there
were
plenty
of
folks
at
court
or
who
had
left
it
who
had
once
been
in
high
favour
and
had
ceased
to
be
through
no
fault
of
their
own
neither
would
i
seek
consolation
from
any
other
source
the
duke
was
civil
to
me
whenever
we
met
and
i
suppose
he
knew
that
i
was
in
trouble
but
he
never
spoke
of
it
indeed
it
was
a
sad
change
from
the
time
when
i
had
returned
so
joyfully
and
found
my
new
lodgings
waiting
for
me
as
we
came
up
through
westminster
i
was
riding
alone
for
i
had
bidden
my
man
james
to
go
aside
to
a
little
shop
that
was
almost
on
our
route
behind
the
abbey
to
buy
me
something
that
i
needed
i
think
it
was
a
pair
of
cuffs
but
i
am
not
sure
it
was
very
near
dark
and
the
lamps
were
not
yet
lighted
as
i
came
towards
the
gate
of
whitehall
i
was
riding
very
carelessly
and
heavily
paying
little
attention
to
anything
for
i
was
thinking
as
it
happened
of
dolly
with
an
extraordinary
misery
in
my
heart
and
of
how
i
should
ever
tell
her
unless
matters
mended
soon
of
what
her
father
had
done
and
whether
in
some
manner
he
would
not
yet
contrive
to
separate
us
my
horse
swerved
a
little
and
i
pulled
him
up
for
there
were
a
couple
of
fellows
immediately
crossing
before
me
i
saw
that
they
looked
hard
at
me
but
i
noticed
no
more
for
at
that
instant
i
heard
a
horse
coming
up
behind
me
and
turned
to
see
that
it
was
james
he
looked
a
little
strange
thought
i
but
he
said
nothing
only
he
came
up
right
beside
me
and
so
rode
with
me
through
the
gate
he
said
nothing
then
nor
did
i
and
it
was
not
until
i
was
dismounted
and
a
fellow
had
run
out
to
take
the
horses
that
he
asked
if
he
might
speak
with
me
why
certainly
said
i
and
we
turned
together
into
the
court
sir
he
said
so
soon
as
we
were
out
of
earshot
of
the
guard
did
you
see
those
two
fellows
without
the
gate
i
said
that
i
had
sir
he
said
they
were
following
you
all
the
way
from
chelsea
i
saw
them
at
winchester
house
and
i
have
seen
them
before
too
eh
said
i
a
little
startled
then
he
told
me
he
had
seen
them
for
the
last
fortnight
three
or
four
times
at
least
and
that
he
was
sure
they
were
after
some
mischief
once
before
too
as
we
were
riding
in
southwark
and
he
had
delayed
for
a
stone
in
his
horse
foot
he
had
seen
them
run
out
from
behind
a
wall
but
that
they
had
made
off
when
they
saw
him
coming
now
i
knew
very
well
what
he
meant
london
was
very
far
from
being
a
safe
place
in
those
days
for
a
man
that
had
enemies
there
was
scarcely
a
week
passed
but
there
was
some
outrage
in
broad
daylight
too
in
less
populated
parts
and
in
the
various
fields
and
after
dark
men
were
not
very
safe
in
the
city
itself
a
year
ago
i
should
have
thought
nothing
of
it
but
i
was
down
in
the
world
now
i
knew
very
well
and
i
had
enemies
who
would
stick
at
nothing
it
was
true
that
they
had
let
me
alone
for
a
while
no
doubt
lest
any
suspicion
should
attach
to
them
but
the
winter
was
on
us
now
and
the
mornings
and
evenings
were
dark
and
too
a
good
deal
of
time
had
elapsed
i
remembered
what
chiffinch
had
said
to
me
at
the
beginning
of
the
trouble
you
did
very
well
to
tell
me
i
said
would
you
know
them
again
if
you
saw
them
i
think
so
sir
he
said
well
i
said
i
have
no
doubt
that
they
are
after
me
you
will
tell
my
other
men
will
you
not
i
told
them
a
week
ago
he
said
i
said
no
more
to
him
then
but
instead
of
going
immediately
to
my
lodgings
i
went
first
to
see
chiffinch
and
found
him
just
come
in
i
told
him
very
briefly
what
james
had
told
me
but
made
no
comment
he
whistled
and
bade
me
sit
down
they
are
after
you
then
he
said
i
thought
they
would
be
but
who
are
they
said
i
a
little
peevishly
if
i
knew
their
names
said
the
page
i
could
put
my
hands
on
them
on
some
excuse
or
other
but
i
do
not
know
it
is
the
dregs
of
the
old
no
doubt
and
what
good
do
they
think
to
get
out
of
me
why
it
is
revenge
no
doubt
he
said
they
know
that
you
are
down
with
the
king
and
have
not
many
friends
and
they
suspect
that
you
are
still
in
with
the
secret
service
no
doubt
they
are
after
my
life
then
i
asked
i
should
suppose
so
he
considered
a
minute
or
two
in
silence
at
last
he
spoke
again
i
will
have
a
word
with
his
majesty
he
is
treating
you
shamefully
mallock
and
i
will
tell
him
so
and
i
will
take
other
measures
also
i
asked
what
those
might
be
i
will
have
my
men
to
look
out
closely
when
you
go
about
you
had
best
not
go
alone
at
all
within
whitehall
you
are
safe
enough
but
i
would
not
go
out
except
with
a
couple
of
men
if
i
were
you
i
told
him
i
always
took
one
at
least
well
i
would
take
two
he
observed
there
was
that
murder
last
week
in
lincoln
inn
fields
put
down
to
the
mohocks
well
it
was
a
gentleman
of
my
own
who
was
killed
though
that
is
not
known
and
it
was
no
more
mohocks
than
it
was
you
or
i
as
we
were
still
talking
my
man
james
came
up
to
seek
me
with
a
letter
that
he
had
found
in
my
lodgings
waiting
for
me
i
knew
the
hand
well
enough
and
i
suppose
that
i
shewed
it
for
when
i
looked
up
from
reading
it
chiffinch
was
looking
at
me
with
a
quizzical
face
that
is
good
news
mallock
is
it
not
i
could
not
refrain
from
smiling
for
indeed
it
was
as
if
the
sun
had
risen
on
my
dreariness
it
is
very
good
news
i
said
it
is
from
my
cousin
the
cousin
chiffinch
she
is
come
to
town
with
her
maid
and
asks
me
to
sup
with
her
well
take
your
two
men
when
you
go
to
see
her
said
he
laughing
a
little
they
can
entertain
the
maid
and
you
the
mistress
i
can
not
say
how
wonderfully
the
whole
aspect
of
the
world
was
changed
to
me
as
i
set
out
in
a
little
hired
coach
i
used
sometimes
with
my
two
men
half
an
hour
later
for
my
old
lodgings
in
covent
garden
where
she
said
she
had
come
that
evening
it
was
a
very
short
letter
but
it
was
very
sweet
to
me
she
said
only
that
she
could
wait
no
more
that
she
knew
how
ill
things
must
be
going
with
me
and
that
she
must
see
with
her
own
eyes
that
i
was
not
dead
altogether
i
had
striven
in
my
letters
to
her
to
make
as
light
as
i
could
of
my
troubles
but
i
suppose
that
her
woman
wit
and
her
love
had
pierced
my
poor
disguises
at
least
here
she
was
she
was
standing
all
ready
to
greet
me
in
that
old
parlour
of
mine
where
i
had
first
met
her
six
years
ago
and
she
was
more
beautiful
now
a
thousand
times
in
my
eyes
than
even
then
the
candles
were
lighted
all
round
the
walls
and
the
curtains
across
the
windows
and
her
maid
was
not
there
she
had
already
changed
her
riding
dress
and
was
in
her
evening
gown
with
her
string
of
little
pearls
as
i
close
my
eyes
now
i
can
see
her
still
as
if
she
stood
before
me
her
lips
were
a
little
parted
and
her
flushed
cheeks
and
her
bright
eyes
made
all
the
room
heaven
for
me
i
had
not
seen
her
for
six
months
well
cousin
roger
she
said
no
more
presently
even
before
supper
came
in
she
had
begun
her
questioning
cousin
roger
she
said
we
two
were
by
the
fire
she
on
a
couch
and
i
in
a
great
chair
cousin
roger
you
have
treated
me
shamefully
you
have
told
me
nothing
except
that
you
were
in
trouble
and
that
i
could
have
guessed
for
myself
i
am
come
to
town
for
three
days
no
more
my
father
for
a
long
time
forbade
me
even
to
do
that
if
he
were
not
gone
to
stortford
for
the
i
should
not
be
here
now
he
does
not
know
you
are
come
to
town
i
cried
she
shook
her
head
like
a
child
and
her
eyes
twinkled
with
merriment
he
thinks
i
am
still
minding
the
sheep
she
said
but
that
is
not
the
point
cousin
roger
i
care
nothing
whatever
for
his
majesty
affairs
nor
for
secret
service
nor
for
anything
else
of
that
kind
but
i
care
very
much
that
you
should
be
in
trouble
and
not
tell
me
what
it
is
now
i
had
not
had
much
time
to
think
what
i
should
say
if
she
questioned
me
as
i
knew
she
would
for
it
would
not
be
an
easy
thing
to
tell
her
that
her
father
was
at
the
root
of
my
troubles
and
had
behaved
like
a
treacherous
hound
yet
sooner
or
later
she
must
be
told
unless
i
lost
heart
altogether
i
might
soften
it
and
soften
it
pretend
that
her
father
owed
a
greater
duty
to
the
king
than
to
me
and
must
have
thought
it
right
to
do
as
he
had
done
but
she
would
see
through
it
all
that
i
knew
very
well
dolly
said
i
very
slowly
i
have
not
told
you
yet
because
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
that
you
could
do
to
help
me
i
have
waited
thinking
that
matters
might
come
straight
again
but
they
have
not
i
will
tell
you
then
before
you
go
home
again
i
promise
you
that
and
on
my
side
i
ask
you
not
to
question
me
this
evening
let
us
have
this
one
evening
without
any
troubles
at
all
she
looked
at
me
very
earnestly
for
a
moment
without
speaking
and
i
could
see
that
her
lightness
of
manner
had
been
but
put
on
to
disguise
how
anxious
she
was
it
is
wonderful
how
a
woman
in
spite
of
her
foolishness
at
other
times
can
read
the
heart
of
a
man
i
had
said
very
little
to
her
in
my
letters
and
yet
i
could
see
now
how
she
had
suffered
all
the
while
i
had
thought
myself
to
have
been
alone
in
my
unhappiness
now
i
understood
that
never
for
an
instant
had
i
been
so
and
my
whole
heart
rose
up
in
a
kind
of
exultation
and
longing
then
she
swallowed
down
her
anxiety
i
take
you
at
your
word
cousin
roger
she
said
lightly
i
will
ask
no
question
at
all
then
anne
and
my
man
james
came
in
with
the
supper
i
think
there
is
not
one
moment
of
that
evening
in
my
old
lodgings
that
i
have
forgotten
as
now
i
look
back
upon
it
it
seems
to
me
to
have
that
kind
of
brightness
which
a
garden
has
when
a
storm
is
coming
up
very
quickly
and
the
clouds
are
very
black
and
yet
the
shadow
has
not
yet
reached
it
i
remember
how
the
curtains
hung
across
the
windows
they
were
my
own
old
curtains
of
blue
stuff
a
little
faded
but
still
rich
and
good
how
the
fire
glowed
in
the
wide
chimney
how
dolly
looked
across
the
table
in
her
blue
sac
with
lace
and
her
wide
sleeves
and
her
little
pearls
she
had
dressed
up
all
for
me
as
indeed
i
had
for
her
for
i
was
in
my
maroon
suit
with
my
sword
and
my
black
periwig
ah
and
above
all
i
remember
the
very
look
in
her
eyes
as
she
suddenly
clapped
her
hands
together
the
servants
were
out
of
the
room
at
that
instant
cousin
roger
she
said
i
shall
never
keep
my
promise
unless
i
am
distracted
we
will
go
to
the
play
you
and
i
and
anne
all
together
and
your
man
james
shall
wait
upon
us
with
oranges
well
she
had
said
it
and
i
laughed
at
her
merriment
she
was
so
like
a
child
on
her
holiday
and
a
stolen
holiday
too
the
ways
of
god
are
very
strange
that
so
much
should
hang
upon
so
little
it
was
upon
that
sudden
thought
of
hers
that
the
whole
of
my
life
turned
and
hers
too
as
it
was
i
said
nothing
but
that
it
should
be
as
she
wished
and
that
my
coach
should
set
us
down
there
and
come
again
when
the
play
was
over
so
the
threads
are
caught
up
in
those
great
unseen
shuttles
that
are
guided
by
god
hand
and
the
whole
pattern
changed
it
would
appear
by
a
moment
whim
and
yet
i
can
not
doubt
for
if
i
did
my
whole
faith
would
be
shattered
that
even
those
whims
are
part
of
the
divine
design
and
that
all
is
done
according
to
his
holy
will
the
rest
of
supper
was
hastened
lest
we
should
be
late
for
the
play
and
then
when
james
came
up
to
tell
us
that
the
coach
was
waiting
though
it
was
scarcely
a
hundred
yards
to
the
theatre
and
dolly
was
gone
for
her
hood
and
cloak
i
stood
with
a
glass
of
wine
in
my
hand
on
the
hearth
looking
down
at
the
fire
now
i
can
not
tell
how
it
was
but
i
suppose
that
the
shadow
that
i
spoke
of
just
now
began
to
touch
that
little
garden
of
love
in
which
i
stood
for
a
kind
of
melancholy
came
on
me
again
while
she
had
been
with
cue
it
had
all
seemed
gone
we
had
been
as
merry
at
supper
as
if
nothing
at
all
were
the
matter
but
now
even
while
she
was
in
the
next
chamber
with
her
maid
i
fell
once
more
i
thought
god
knows
why
of
the
little
parlour
at
hare
street
which
i
had
not
seen
for
so
long
and
of
the
fire
that
burned
there
upon
that
hearth
too
the
hearth
on
which
i
had
stood
in
my
foolish
patronizing
pride
when
i
had
first
asked
her
to
be
my
wife
and
she
had
treated
me
as
i
deserved
i
did
not
think
then
of
how
we
had
sat
there
together
afterwards
so
often
and
of
the
happiness
i
had
had
there
but
only
of
that
miserable
christmas
night
when
i
thought
i
had
lost
her
the
mood
came
on
me
suddenly
and
i
was
still
brooding
when
she
came
in
again
alone
she
was
in
her
hood
and
her
face
looked
out
of
it
like
a
flower
cousin
roger
she
said
i
have
never
told
you
why
i
came
up
my
dear
you
did
i
said
it
was
your
father
who
no
no
but
this
day
in
particular
cousin
roger
the
woman
came
again
last
night
the
woman
what
woman
i
asked
why
the
tall
old
woman
to
my
chamber
up
the
stairs
you
remember
she
came
the
night
before
you
were
sent
for
why
six
years
ago
i
stared
on
her
and
a
kind
of
horror
came
on
me
ah
do
not
look
like
that
she
said
it
is
nothing
she
smiled
full
at
me
putting
her
hand
on
my
arm
you
saw
her
i
said
no
no
i
heard
her
only
it
was
just
as
it
was
before
but
i
came
up
to
town
to
to
see
if
all
were
well
with
you
and
it
is
or
will
be
kiss
me
roger
before
we
go
chapter
vi
i
can
not
think
without
horror
even
now
of
that
play
we
saw
on
that
night
in
the
king
theatre
it
was
aphra
behn
tragedy
called
or
moor
and
lee
acted
the
principal
part
of
the
spanish
queen
we
sat
in
a
little
box
next
the
stage
which
we
had
to
ourselves
and
in
the
box
opposite
was
my
lord
the
earl
of
bath
with
a
couple
of
his
ladies
he
was
a
fellow
and
a
hot
protestant
and
he
looked
very
disdainfully
at
the
company
in
the
box
over
him
was
mistress
gwyn
herself
and
the
people
cried
at
her
when
she
came
in
at
which
she
bowed
very
merrily
as
if
she
were
royal
this
way
and
that
so
that
the
whole
was
full
of
laughter
it
was
turned
very
cold
with
a
frost
and
before
the
play
was
half
done
the
whole
house
was
in
a
steam
under
the
glass
cupola
folks
were
eating
oranges
everywhere
in
the
higher
seats
and
throwing
the
peel
down
upon
the
heads
of
the
people
below
the
stage
was
lighted
as
always
with
wax
candles
burning
on
cressets
and
the
orange
girls
were
standing
in
the
front
row
of
the
pit
with
their
backs
to
the
stage
dolly
who
was
a
little
quiet
at
first
got
very
merry
and
excited
presently
at
all
the
as
well
as
at
the
actors
she
had
thrown
her
hood
back
so
that
her
head
came
out
of
it
very
sweet
and
pretty
and
a
spot
of
colour
burned
on
each
cheek
i
saw
her
watching
mistress
nell
once
or
twice
with
a
look
of
amazement
for
she
knew
who
she
was
for
nell
though
she
was
not
on
the
stage
bore
herself
as
though
she
were
and
never
ceased
for
an
instant
though
full
of
merriment
and
good
humour
to
turn
herself
this
way
and
that
and
bow
to
her
friends
some
of
whom
relished
it
very
little
and
to
applaud
very
heartily
and
then
immediately
to
throw
a
great
piece
of
orange
peel
at
harris
who
played
the
king
she
had
her
boy
with
her
whom
his
majesty
had
made
duke
of
albans
and
two
or
three
gentlemen
whom
i
did
not
know
dolly
whispered
to
me
once
to
know
who
the
boy
was
that
is
her
boy
i
said
dolly
said
nothing
but
i
understood
the
kind
of
terror
that
she
had
to
see
them
both
there
so
outrageous
and
bold
but
she
presently
turned
back
again
to
the
stage
to
observe
the
play
i
said
just
now
that
the
play
which
we
saw
has
very
dreadful
memories
for
me
but
i
do
not
know
that
more
than
once
or
twice
at
the
time
i
had
any
such
feeling
there
were
some
pretty
passages
in
the
play
that
distracted
me
altogether
and
a
song
or
two
of
which
i
remember
very
well
one
sung
by
a
and
answered
by
her
swain
with
his
shepherds
of
which
the
refrain
was
sun
is
up
and
will
not
stay
oh
how
very
short
a
lover
day
for
the
rest
there
was
a
quantity
of
bloodshed
and
intrigue
and
false
accusation
but
i
was
surprised
considering
the
subject
how
little
was
against
popery
but
behn
was
content
at
the
end
of
it
to
make
the
beg
pardon
of
for
the
most
part
then
i
attended
to
the
action
and
to
dolly
of
course
all
the
while
yet
certainly
there
were
other
moments
for
me
when
the
shadow
came
down
again
and
i
saw
the
actors
and
the
whole
house
as
if
in
a
kind
of
bloody
mist
though
i
had
at
that
time
no
reason
for
it
at
all
and
do
not
think
that
i
shewed
any
sign
of
it
two
or
three
times
before
as
i
have
related
there
came
on
me
a
strange
mood
once
when
i
came
up
from
wapping
and
once
as
i
put
out
from
dover
in
the
packet
but
it
was
not
that
kind
of
mood
this
time
then
it
was
as
if
all
the
world
of
sense
were
but
a
very
thin
veil
and
all
that
was
happening
a
kind
of
dream
or
play
now
it
was
as
if
the
play
had
a
shocking
kind
of
reality
as
if
the
audience
and
the
actors
were
monstrous
devils
in
hell
and
the
paint
on
lee
cheeks
her
true
colour
and
her
gestures
great
symbols
and
the
noise
of
the
people
the
roar
of
hell
this
came
and
went
once
or
twice
and
at
the
time
i
thought
it
to
be
my
own
humour
only
but
now
i
know
that
it
was
something
other
than
this
when
i
looked
at
dolly
it
went
again
in
an
instant
and
she
and
i
seemed
to
me
the
heart
of
everything
and
all
else
but
our
circumstances
and
for
our
pleasure
well
it
ended
at
last
and
there
was
a
great
deal
of
applauding
and
lee
came
on
to
the
stage
again
to
bow
and
smile
it
was
then
for
the
third
time
i
think
that
my
horror
fell
on
me
as
i
stared
at
her
all
else
seemed
to
turn
dim
and
vanish
she
was
in
her
costume
with
the
blood
on
her
arm
and
breast
and
her
great
billowy
skirts
about
her
and
her
and
she
was
smiling
and
i
as
i
looked
at
her
seemed
to
see
the
folly
and
the
shame
of
her
like
fire
and
yet
that
folly
and
shame
had
a
power
that
nothing
else
had
her
smile
seemed
to
me
like
the
grin
of
a
devil
and
her
colour
to
be
daubs
upon
her
bare
and
she
herself
like
some
rotten
thing
with
a
semblance
of
life
that
was
not
life
at
all
i
can
not
put
it
into
words
at
all
i
know
only
that
i
ceased
applauding
and
stared
on
her
as
if
i
were
bewitched
then
i
saw
my
dear
love
fingers
on
my
arm
and
her
face
looking
at
me
as
if
she
were
frightened
what
is
the
matter
cousin
roger
she
whispered
and
then
come
cousin
roger
it
is
late
then
my
mood
passed
or
i
shook
myself
clear
of
it
yes
yes
i
said
it
is
nothing
come
my
dear
the
little
passage
by
which
we
went
out
was
crammed
full
of
folk
talking
and
whistling
and
laughing
some
imitating
the
cries
of
the
actors
some
both
men
and
women
looking
about
them
freely
with
bold
eyes
i
saw
presently
that
dolly
did
not
like
it
and
that
we
should
be
a
great
while
getting
out
that
way
and
then
i
saw
a
little
door
beside
me
that
might
very
well
lead
out
to
the
air
i
pushed
upon
this
and
saw
another
little
passage
james
said
i
for
he
was
close
behind
me
go
out
and
bring
the
coach
round
to
this
side
if
there
is
a
way
out
and
then
to
dolly
come
sweetheart
we
will
find
a
way
out
here
i
pushed
my
way
behind
a
fellow
who
was
just
in
front
and
got
through
the
door
and
dolly
and
her
maid
followed
me
it
was
a
little
passage
with
doors
on
the
right
which
i
think
led
to
the
actors
rooms
and
the
stage
for
i
heard
talking
and
laughing
behind
but
i
made
nothing
of
that
and
we
went
on
as
we
went
past
one
of
the
doors
it
opened
all
of
a
sudden
and
lee
herself
came
out
still
in
her
dress
and
her
jewels
and
her
face
all
with
paint
and
the
blood
on
her
arm
and
dress
and
ran
through
another
door
further
along
leaving
behind
her
a
great
whiff
of
coarse
perfume
it
was
but
for
an
instant
that
we
saw
her
yet
even
in
that
instant
a
sort
of
horror
came
on
me
again
as
if
she
were
something
monstrous
and
ominous
though
poor
woman
i
have
never
heard
anything
against
her
more
than
was
said
at
that
time
against
all
women
that
were
actresses
all
that
is
except
betterton
she
appeared
more
dreadful
even
than
in
the
play
or
than
when
she
had
spoken
those
terrible
words
as
she
sat
in
her
chair
all
bloody
as
she
died
stabbed
by
the
mock
friar
is
too
late
and
life
and
love
must
yield
to
death
and
i
looked
at
dolly
but
she
was
laughing
though
with
a
kind
of
terror
in
her
eyes
too
at
that
sudden
apparition
oh
roger
she
said
and
now
she
will
go
and
wash
it
all
off
will
she
not
yes
yes
i
said
she
will
wash
it
all
off
and
i
looked
at
her
and
made
myself
laugh
too
she
said
nothing
but
took
my
arm
a
little
closer
i
was
right
about
the
passage
that
it
led
out
to
the
air
yet
not
into
little
russell
street
but
to
a
little
yard
by
which
i
suppose
the
players
came
to
their
rooms
the
frost
had
fallen
very
sharp
while
we
had
been
in
the
theatre
overhead
the
stars
tingled
as
if
they
shook
beyond
the
chimneys
and
there
were
little
pools
of
ice
between
the
stones
i
stayed
an
instant
when
we
came
down
the
three
steps
that
led
into
the
yard
to
pull
dolly
hood
more
closely
about
her
head
for
it
was
bitter
cold
and
to
gather
up
my
own
cloak
and
as
i
did
this
i
saw
that
three
men
had
followed
us
out
and
were
coming
down
the
steps
behind
us
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
yard
there
was
one
little
burning
near
one
of
the
two
entrances
to
shew
the
players
the
way
i
suppose
then
when
i
had
arranged
my
cloak
i
gave
dolly
my
arm
once
more
and
as
i
did
so
heard
anne
who
was
behind
us
suddenly
give
a
great
scream
and
at
the
sound
whisked
about
to
see
what
was
the
matter
there
was
a
man
coming
at
me
from
behind
with
a
dagger
and
the
two
other
fellows
were
behind
him
now
i
had
not
an
instant
in
which
to
think
what
to
do
though
i
knew
well
enough
what
they
were
and
whom
they
were
after
what
i
did
i
did
i
suppose
by
a
kind
of
instinct
i
tore
my
arm
free
from
dolly
hand
pushing
her
behind
me
with
my
left
hand
and
at
the
same
time
dashed
my
cloak
away
as
well
as
i
could
to
draw
out
my
sword
the
fellow
was
a
little
on
my
right
when
i
was
so
turned
about
but
appeared
a
little
confounded
by
my
quickness
for
he
hesitated
back
to
the
wall
dolly
i
shouted
back
to
the
wall
and
at
the
same
time
i
began
to
back
myself
with
her
still
behind
me
to
the
wall
that
was
opposite
to
the
steps
we
had
just
come
down
my
cloak
was
sadly
in
my
way
but
as
i
reached
the
wall
still
going
backwards
i
had
my
sword
out
just
in
time
to
keep
off
by
a
flourish
of
it
the
fellow
who
had
recovered
himself
and
was
coming
at
me
again
so
for
a
moment
we
stood
and
in
that
moment
i
heard
anne
screaming
somewhere
for
help
then
i
saw
how
the
two
other
men
at
a
swift
sign
from
their
leader
spread
out
on
this
side
and
that
so
as
to
come
at
me
from
three
directions
together
and
at
that
saw
that
i
must
delay
no
longer
before
i
think
they
saw
what
i
intended
i
leapt
forward
at
the
fellow
in
front
and
lunged
with
all
my
force
and
though
he
threw
up
his
arms
with
the
dagger
in
one
of
his
bands
and
tried
to
evade
a
parry
all
at
once
he
was
too
late
my
point
went
clean
through
his
throat
and
he
fell
backwards
with
a
dreadful
cry
and
at
the
same
moment
his
two
companions
ran
in
on
me
from
either
side
now
i
do
not
even
now
see
what
else
i
could
have
done
i
felt
sure
that
one
of
them
would
have
me
for
i
could
not
properly
deal
with
them
both
but
i
turned
and
stabbed
quickly
with
a
short
arm
at
the
face
of
the
one
on
my
right
missing
him
altogether
and
at
the
same
time
strove
to
strike
with
my
left
elbow
the
face
of
the
other
but
ah
dolly
was
too
quick
for
me
she
must
have
run
forward
on
my
left
to
keep
the
fellow
off
for
i
heard
a
swift
dreadful
sound
as
i
shortened
my
right
arm
to
stab
at
the
other
again
and
i
felt
something
fall
about
my
feet
i
turned
like
a
madman
screaming
aloud
with
anger
careless
of
all
else
or
of
whether
or
no
anyone
ran
at
me
again
for
i
knew
in
part
at
least
what
had
happened
and
at
the
same
moment
the
yard
seemed
all
alive
with
folks
running
and
crying
out
the
door
at
the
head
of
the
steps
was
open
and
three
or
four
players
ran
out
and
down
while
from
little
russell
street
on
the
right
where
the
coaches
were
a
great
number
ran
in
but
i
cared
nothing
for
that
at
that
instant
i
had
flung
away
my
sword
on
to
the
stones
and
was
stooping
to
pick
up
my
dear
love
who
had
saved
my
life
there
was
already
a
great
puddle
of
blood
and
i
felt
it
run
hot
over
my
left
hand
that
was
about
her
hot
for
it
flowed
straight
from
her
heart
that
had
been
stabbed
through
by
the
knife
that
was
aimed
at
me
when
i
looked
up
again
i
saw
standing
against
the
light
in
the
door
opposite
at
the
head
of
the
steps
the
woman
that
had
played
the
queen
with
that
still
on
her
arm
and
breast
chapter
vii
mallock
said
the
page
the
king
is
heartily
sorry
and
wishes
to
tell
you
so
himself
i
said
nothing
of
all
that
happened
after
dolly
death
in
the
i
think
now
as
of
a
kind
of
dream
though
it
changed
my
whole
life
and
has
made
me
what
i
am
i
have
too
scarcely
the
heart
to
write
of
it
and
what
i
say
of
it
now
is
gathered
partly
from
what
i
can
remember
and
partly
from
what
other
folks
told
me
it
must
have
been
a
terrible
sight
that
they
all
saw
as
they
ran
in
from
the
lane
my
man
james
first
among
them
all
there
lay
bloodying
all
the
ice
about
him
the
fellow
whom
i
had
run
through
the
throat
as
dead
as
the
rat
he
was
but
still
jerking
blood
from
beneath
his
ear
and
there
in
my
arms
as
i
kneeled
on
the
stones
lay
dolly
her
head
fallen
back
and
out
of
her
hood
as
white
as
a
lily
dead
too
in
an
instant
for
she
was
stabbed
through
her
heart
with
her
in
a
great
smear
down
her
side
and
all
over
my
hands
and
clothes
my
man
james
proved
again
as
faithful
a
friend
as
he
had
always
been
to
me
for
the
affair
had
been
no
fault
of
his
i
had
sent
him
for
the
coach
and
he
was
bringing
it
up
to
the
from
the
lane
as
anne
had
run
out
screaming
then
he
had
run
in
and
my
other
man
with
him
and
the
crowd
after
him
in
time
to
see
the
two
living
assassins
make
off
into
the
dark
entrance
on
the
other
side
a
number
had
run
after
them
but
to
no
purpose
for
we
never
heard
of
them
again
and
my
dolly
murderer
i
suppose
is
still
breathing
god
air
unless
he
has
been
hanged
long
ago
for
some
other
crime
the
next
matter
was
to
get
us
home
again
for
james
has
told
me
that
i
would
allow
no
one
to
touch
either
her
or
me
until
a
physician
came
out
of
the
crowd
and
told
me
the
truth
then
i
had
gathered
her
up
in
my
arms
like
a
child
without
a
word
to
any
and
went
out
the
crowd
falling
back
as
i
came
to
where
the
coach
waited
in
little
russell
street
still
carrying
her
i
went
into
the
coach
and
would
allow
no
one
else
within
and
so
we
drove
back
to
covent
garden
when
we
came
there
a
part
of
the
crowd
had
already
run
on
before
and
was
waiting
when
the
coach
drew
up
i
came
out
of
the
coach
with
my
dear
love
still
in
my
arms
and
went
upstairs
with
her
to
her
own
chamber
and
laid
her
on
her
bed
and
it
was
a
great
while
before
i
would
let
the
women
come
at
her
to
wash
her
and
make
all
sweet
and
clean
again
i
lay
all
that
night
in
the
outer
parlour
that
had
been
my
own
so
long
ago
or
rather
i
went
up
and
down
it
till
daybreak
and
no
one
dared
to
speak
to
me
or
to
move
away
the
from
the
table
where
she
and
i
had
supped
the
night
before
the
inquest
was
held
that
day
but
nothing
came
of
it
i
related
my
story
in
the
barest
words
saying
that
i
knew
nothing
of
the
three
men
and
leaving
it
to
chiffinch
to
whisper
in
the
officer
ear
to
prevent
him
asking
what
he
should
not
of
the
man
i
had
killed
nothing
was
ever
made
public
except
that
he
was
a
tanner
man
and
lived
in
wapping
and
that
his
name
was
belton
on
the
saturday
we
went
down
to
hare
street
all
together
with
the
body
of
the
little
maid
in
a
coach
by
itself
i
rode
my
horse
behind
but
would
speak
never
a
word
to
my
cousin
tom
who
went
in
a
coach
neither
then
nor
at
any
other
time
neither
would
i
lie
in
hare
street
house
nor
even
enter
it
but
i
lay
in
the
house
of
a
farmer
at
hormead
and
waited
outside
the
house
for
the
funeral
to
come
out
next
day
after
the
morning
prayer
had
been
said
in
the
church
she
lies
now
in
the
churchyard
of
hormead
parva
where
we
laid
her
on
that
windy
sunday
in
the
shadow
of
the
little
saxon
church
i
rode
straight
away
again
with
my
men
from
the
churchyard
gate
and
came
to
london
very
late
that
night
i
went
straight
to
my
lodgings
and
refused
myself
to
everyone
for
three
days
writing
letters
here
and
there
and
giving
orders
as
to
the
packing
of
all
my
effects
on
the
thursday
a
week
after
my
cousin
dolly
had
come
to
town
i
went
to
chiffinch
to
take
my
leave
now
of
those
days
i
dare
say
no
more
than
that
and
even
if
i
would
i
could
add
very
little
my
mind
throughout
was
in
a
kind
of
dark
tumult
until
after
my
three
days
of
solitude
i
had
determined
what
to
do
there
were
hours
i
will
not
deny
in
which
my
very
faith
in
god
himself
seemed
wholly
gone
in
which
it
was
merely
incredible
to
me
that
if
he
were
in
heaven
such
things
could
happen
on
earth
but
sorrow
of
such
a
dreadful
kind
as
this
is
in
truth
if
we
will
but
yield
to
it
a
sort
of
initiation
or
revelation
rather
than
an
obscurer
of
truth
and
by
the
time
that
my
three
days
were
over
i
thought
i
saw
where
my
duty
lay
and
to
what
all
those
events
tended
i
had
come
from
a
monk
life
that
i
might
taste
what
the
world
was
like
i
had
tasted
and
found
it
very
bitter
there
was
not
one
affair
for
so
it
appeared
to
me
then
that
had
not
failure
written
all
over
it
very
well
then
i
would
go
back
to
the
monk
life
once
more
if
they
would
have
me
on
the
third
day
then
i
had
written
to
my
lord
abbot
at
telling
him
that
i
was
coming
back
again
and
had
thrown
up
my
affairs
here
you
were
right
my
lord
i
wrote
at
the
end
of
it
and
i
was
wrong
my
vocation
seems
very
plain
to
me
now
and
i
would
to
god
that
i
had
seen
it
sooner
or
at
the
least
been
more
humble
to
your
opinion
at
first
i
had
thought
that
i
would
take
no
leave
of
the
king
and
had
told
chiffinch
so
after
i
had
announced
to
him
what
my
intentions
were
and
announced
them
too
in
such
a
manner
that
he
scarcely
even
attempted
to
dissuade
me
from
them
but
he
had
begged
me
to
take
my
leave
in
proper
form
no
harm
would
be
done
by
that
and
then
he
had
told
me
that
his
majesty
knew
all
that
had
passed
and
was
very
sorry
for
it
i
sat
silent
when
he
said
that
yes
mallock
he
said
again
and
i
mean
not
only
for
your
own
sorrow
but
for
his
own
treatment
of
you
it
hath
been
a
whim
with
him
he
treats
often
so
those
whom
he
loves
his
majesty
hath
something
of
a
woman
in
him
in
that
matter
his
suspicions
were
real
enough
at
least
for
a
time
i
had
done
better
if
i
had
been
one
of
his
enemies
then
said
i
it
is
of
no
use
to
be
bitter
sir
said
the
page
men
are
what
they
are
we
would
all
be
otherwise
no
doubt
if
we
could
see
the
king
mallock
i
beg
of
you
and
appear
once
at
least
at
court
publicly
you
should
allow
him
at
least
to
make
amends
i
gave
a
great
sigh
well
it
shall
be
so
i
said
but
i
must
leave
town
on
tuesday
it
was
with
a
very
strange
sense
of
detachment
that
i
went
about
my
affairs
all
friday
and
saturday
for
i
had
still
plenty
to
do
and
was
not
to
see
his
majesty
till
the
saturday
night
after
supper
the
weather
was
turned
soft
again
and
we
had
sunshine
for
an
hour
or
two
on
one
day
i
watched
his
majesty
go
to
dinner
with
his
guards
about
him
and
his
gentlemen
but
i
did
not
see
it
with
the
pleasure
i
had
once
had
in
such
brave
sights
it
was
with
me
during
those
days
as
it
had
been
with
me
for
those
two
or
three
moments
during
the
play
though
in
a
gentler
manner
for
i
thought
more
of
the
humanity
beneath
than
of
the
show
above
and
a
rotten
humanity
most
of
it
seemed
to
me
these
were
but
men
like
myself
and
some
pretty
evil
too
those
gentlemen
that
were
with
the
king
there
was
scarcely
one
of
them
about
whom
i
did
not
know
something
considerably
to
his
discredit
there
was
my
lord
ailesbury
in
strict
attendance
on
him
and
killigrew
he
that
had
the
theatre
and
the
less
said
of
him
the
better
and
there
were
three
or
four
more
like
him
the
earl
of
craven
was
there
colonel
of
the
and
lord
keeper
guildford
and
the
earl
of
bath
and
there
in
the
midst
the
king
himself
with
his
blue
silk
cloak
over
his
shoulders
and
his
princely
walk
going
fast
as
he
always
did
and
what
of
those
thirteen
known
mistresses
of
his
that
he
had
had
as
well
as
of
those
other
god
knows
how
many
poor
maids
who
must
look
upon
him
as
their
ruin
it
was
a
brave
sight
enough
there
in
the
sunshine
i
will
not
deny
that
with
the
sun
on
the
jewels
and
the
silks
and
on
the
buff
and
steel
of
the
guards
with
that
swift
kingly
figure
going
in
the
midst
and
it
was
a
brave
noise
that
the
music
made
as
they
went
within
the
but
how
thought
i
does
god
see
it
all
and
for
what
do
such
things
count
before
his
holy
presence
i
had
not
rehearsed
what
i
should
say
to
his
majesty
when
i
saw
him
for
indeed
it
was
of
no
further
moment
to
me
what
either
i
or
he
should
say
i
should
be
gone
for
ever
in
three
days
to
the
secret
service
of
another
king
than
him
to
that
secret
service
where
men
need
not
lie
and
cheat
and
spy
and
get
their
hearts
broken
after
all
and
no
gratitude
for
it
but
to
that
service
which
is
called
in
the
choir
and
is
prayer
and
study
and
contemplation
in
the
cloister
and
the
cell
there
i
should
sing
week
by
week
oh
put
not
your
trust
in
princes
nor
in
any
child
of
man
for
there
is
no
help
in
them
in
such
a
mood
then
not
wholly
christian
i
will
admit
i
came
into
the
king
closet
to
take
my
leave
of
him
on
that
saturday
night
the
last
day
of
january
in
the
year
of
salvation
sixteen
hundred
and
he
was
standing
up
when
i
entered
his
private
closet
with
a
very
serious
look
on
his
face
and
to
my
astonishment
took
a
step
towards
me
holding
out
both
his
hands
i
will
not
deny
that
i
was
moved
but
i
had
determined
to
be
very
stiff
so
i
saluted
him
in
the
proper
manner
very
carefully
and
punctually
kneeling
to
kiss
his
hand
and
then
standing
upright
again
a
little
spaniel
barked
at
me
all
the
time
there
there
mallock
he
said
sit
you
down
sit
you
down
there
are
some
amends
due
to
you
i
seated
myself
as
he
bade
me
and
he
leaned
towards
me
a
little
from
his
own
chair
with
one
leg
across
the
other
i
saw
that
he
limped
a
little
as
he
went
to
his
chair
and
learned
afterwards
that
he
had
a
sore
on
his
heel
from
walking
in
the
park
there
are
some
amends
due
to
you
he
said
again
but
first
i
wish
to
tell
you
how
very
truly
i
grieve
at
the
sorrow
that
has
come
on
you
and
in
my
service
too
as
i
understand
ah
thought
i
then
chiffinch
has
made
that
plain
enough
he
spoke
with
the
greatest
feeling
and
gravity
but
the
next
moment
he
near
ruined
it
all
ah
these
ladies
he
said
how
they
can
torment
a
man
heart
to
be
sure
how
they
can
torture
us
and
yet
send
us
into
a
kind
of
ecstasy
all
at
once
we
hate
them
one
day
and
vow
never
to
see
them
again
and
yet
when
they
die
or
leave
us
we
would
give
the
world
to
get
them
back
again
for
the
moment
i
felt
myself
all
stiff
with
anger
at
such
a
manner
of
speaking
and
then
once
more
a
great
pity
came
on
me
what
after
all
does
this
man
thought
i
know
of
love
as
god
meant
it
to
be
well
well
he
said
it
is
of
no
use
speaking
i
know
that
well
enough
and
it
was
that
very
cousin
i
hear
that
was
maid
to
her
majesty
yes
sir
said
i
very
short
i
wondered
if
he
would
say
next
that
that
circumstance
made
it
all
the
sadder
but
he
was
not
gross
enough
for
that
well
he
said
i
will
say
no
more
on
that
point
i
am
only
grieved
that
it
should
have
come
upon
you
in
my
service
and
i
wish
to
make
amends
i
already
owed
you
a
heavy
debt
mallock
and
this
has
made
it
the
heavier
and
before
saying
any
more
i
wish
to
tell
you
that
i
am
heartily
sorry
for
my
suspicions
of
you
they
were
real
enough
i
am
ashamed
to
say
i
should
have
known
better
but
at
least
i
have
got
rid
of
hoskyns
and
he
hath
gone
to
the
devil
altogether
i
hear
he
had
a
cunning
way
with
him
you
know
mr
mallock
he
spoke
almost
as
if
he
pleaded
and
i
was
amazed
at
his
condescension
it
is
not
the
way
of
kings
to
ask
pardon
very
often
well
mallock
he
said
next
and
i
hear
that
you
wish
to
leave
my
service
if
your
majesty
pleases
said
i
my
majesty
doth
not
please
at
all
but
he
will
submit
i
suppose
tell
me
sir
why
it
is
that
you
wish
to
leave
sir
i
said
the
reasons
are
pretty
plain
i
have
displeased
your
majesty
for
the
past
and
i
can
not
forget
that
even
though
sir
you
are
graciously
pleased
to
compliment
me
now
then
i
have
quarrelled
with
my
cousin
jermyn
so
that
i
have
not
a
kinsman
left
in
england
and
and
i
have
lost
her
whom
i
was
to
make
my
wife
this
year
finally
if
more
reasons
are
wanting
i
am
weary
of
a
world
in
which
i
have
failed
so
greatly
and
i
must
go
back
again
to
the
cloister
if
they
will
have
me
there
all
came
with
a
rush
when
i
began
to
speak
for
his
majesty
presence
had
always
an
extraordinary
effect
upon
me
as
upon
so
many
others
i
had
determined
to
say
very
little
yet
here
i
had
said
it
all
and
i
felt
the
blood
in
my
face
he
listened
very
patiently
to
me
with
his
head
a
little
on
one
side
and
his
underlip
thrust
out
and
his
great
melancholy
eyes
searching
my
face
well
well
well
he
said
again
if
you
must
be
a
monk
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
but
what
of
your
apostleship
in
the
world
sir
i
cried
for
i
knew
what
he
meant
my
apostleship
as
you
name
it
has
been
a
greater
disaster
than
all
the
rest
and
god
knows
that
is
great
enough
he
was
silent
a
full
half
minute
i
should
think
still
looking
on
me
earnestly
are
you
so
sure
of
that
said
he
my
heart
gave
a
leap
but
he
held
up
his
hand
before
i
could
speak
wait
sir
he
said
i
will
tell
you
this
you
have
said
very
little
to
me
but
i
vow
to
you
that
what
you
have
said
i
have
remembered
it
is
not
argument
that
a
man
needs
at
least
after
the
first
but
example
that
you
have
given
me
then
i
flushed
up
scarlet
for
i
was
sure
he
was
mocking
me
sir
i
cried
you
might
have
spared
he
lifted
his
eyes
a
little
i
assure
you
mallock
he
said
that
i
mean
what
i
say
you
have
been
very
faithful
you
have
ventured
your
life
again
and
again
for
me
you
have
refused
rewards
except
the
very
smallest
you
have
lost
even
your
sweetheart
in
my
service
and
now
when
all
is
within
your
reach
again
you
fling
it
back
at
me
it
is
not
very
gracious
but
it
is
very
christian
as
i
understand
christianity
i
said
nothing
what
was
there
to
say
i
seemed
a
very
poor
christian
to
myself
come
come
mallock
pursued
the
king
very
gently
and
kindly
think
of
it
once
again
you
shall
have
what
you
please
your
viscounty
or
anything
else
of
that
sort
and
you
shall
keep
your
lodgings
and
remain
here
as
my
friend
what
do
you
say
to
that
for
a
moment
again
i
hesitated
for
it
is
not
to
everyone
that
a
king
offers
his
friendship
if
it
had
been
that
alone
i
think
i
might
have
yielded
for
i
knew
that
i
loved
this
man
in
spite
of
all
his
wickedness
and
his
treatment
of
me
for
that
and
for
my
apostleship
as
he
called
it
i
might
have
stayed
but
at
the
word
all
turned
to
bitterness
i
remembered
my
childish
dreams
and
the
sweetness
of
them
and
the
sweetness
of
my
dear
love
who
was
to
have
shared
them
and
all
turned
to
bitterness
and
vanity
no
sir
said
i
and
i
felt
my
lips
tremble
no
sir
i
will
be
ungracious
and
and
christian
to
the
end
i
am
resolved
to
go
and
nothing
in
this
world
shall
keep
me
from
it
the
king
stood
up
abruptly
and
i
rose
with
him
i
did
not
know
whether
he
were
angry
or
not
and
i
did
not
greatly
care
he
stepped
away
from
me
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
one
of
his
whined
at
him
from
her
basket
lifting
her
great
liquid
eyes
that
were
not
unlike
his
own
and
he
stooped
and
caressed
her
for
a
moment
then
the
clocks
began
to
chime
one
after
the
other
for
it
was
eight
and
i
heard
them
at
it
too
in
the
beyond
there
would
be
thirty
or
forty
of
them
i
daresay
in
the
two
chambers
so
for
a
minute
or
two
he
went
up
and
down
and
i
have
but
to
close
my
eyes
now
to
see
him
again
he
was
limping
a
little
from
the
sore
on
his
heel
but
he
carried
himself
very
kingly
his
swarthy
face
looking
straight
before
him
and
his
lips
pursed
i
think
that
indeed
he
was
a
little
angry
but
that
he
was
resolved
not
to
shew
it
suddenly
he
wheeled
on
me
and
held
out
his
hand
well
mallock
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
and
i
must
honour
you
for
it
whatever
else
i
do
i
would
that
all
my
servants
were
as
disinterested
i
knelt
to
kiss
his
hand
i
think
i
could
not
have
spoken
at
that
moment
as
i
stood
up
he
spoke
again
when
do
you
leave
town
he
said
on
tuesday
sir
well
come
and
see
me
again
before
you
go
no
not
in
private
you
need
not
fear
for
that
come
night
to
the
after
supper
i
will
do
so
sir
said
i
on
the
following
night
then
which
was
sunday
i
presented
myself
for
the
last
time
i
thought
to
his
majesty
i
need
not
say
that
half
a
dozen
times
since
i
had
left
him
my
resolution
had
faltered
though
it
had
never
broken
down
i
heard
mass
in
weld
street
and
there
again
i
wondered
whether
i
had
decided
rightly
and
again
as
i
burned
all
my
papers
after
dinner
for
when
a
man
begins
afresh
he
had
best
make
a
clean
sweep
of
the
past
i
went
to
take
the
air
a
little
before
sunset
in
james
park
and
from
a
good
distance
saw
his
majesty
going
to
feed
the
ducks
with
a
dozen
spaniels
i
daresay
going
after
him
and
a
couple
of
gentlemen
with
him
but
no
guards
at
all
the
king
walked
much
more
slowly
that
day
than
was
his
wont
i
suppose
because
of
the
sore
on
his
heel
but
i
did
not
go
near
enough
for
him
to
see
me
for
i
would
trouble
him
now
no
further
than
i
need
all
this
time
or
at
least
now
and
again
i
wondered
a
little
as
to
whether
i
was
right
to
go
i
will
not
deny
that
the
prospect
of
remaining
had
a
little
allurement
in
it
but
it
was
truly
not
more
than
a
little
and
as
evening
fell
and
my
heart
went
inwards
again
as
hearts
do
when
the
curtains
are
drawn
i
wondered
that
it
had
been
any
allurement
at
all
for
my
life
lay
buried
in
the
churchyard
of
hormead
parva
and
i
had
best
bury
the
rest
of
me
in
the
place
where
at
least
i
had
a
few
friends
left
after
supper
about
ten
i
put
on
my
cloak
and
went
across
to
the
duchess
of
portsmouth
lodgings
where
the
was
held
usually
on
such
evenings
my
man
james
went
with
me
to
light
me
there
i
do
not
think
i
have
seen
a
more
splendid
sight
very
often
than
that
great
gallery
when
i
came
into
it
that
night
passing
on
my
way
through
the
closet
where
i
had
once
talked
with
her
grace
it
was
all
alight
from
end
to
end
with
candles
in
cressets
and
on
the
great
round
table
at
the
further
end
where
the
company
was
playing
basset
stood
tall
candlesticks
amidst
all
the
gold
i
had
not
seen
this
great
gallery
before
and
it
was
beyond
everything
and
far
beyond
her
majesty
own
great
chamber
if
i
had
thought
the
closet
fine
this
was
a
thousand
times
more
there
were
great
french
tapestries
on
the
walls
and
between
them
paintings
that
had
been
once
her
majesty
and
those
not
the
worst
of
them
the
quantity
of
silver
in
the
room
astonished
me
there
were
whole
tables
of
it
and
braziers
and
sconces
and
cressets
beyond
reckoning
and
there
were
at
least
five
or
six
chiming
clocks
that
the
king
had
given
to
her
grace
and
tall
japanese
presses
and
cabinets
of
lacquer
which
she
loved
especially
there
was
a
fire
of
scotch
coal
burning
on
the
hearth
as
in
his
majesty
own
bedchamber
and
on
a
great
silver
couch
beside
this
covered
with
silk
tapestry
sat
the
king
smiling
to
himself
with
two
or
three
dogs
beside
him
and
her
grace
of
portsmouth
on
the
same
couch
the
duchesses
of
cleveland
and
mazarin
were
on
chairs
very
near
the
couch
there
was
a
great
clamour
of
voices
from
the
as
i
came
in
and
the
king
looked
up
and
as
i
went
across
to
pay
my
respects
to
his
majesty
he
said
something
to
the
duchess
very
merrily
she
too
glanced
up
at
me
and
indeed
she
was
a
splendid
sight
in
her
silks
and
in
the
jewels
she
had
had
from
him
why
here
is
my
friend
said
the
king
as
he
put
out
his
hand
to
me
and
once
more
the
dogs
yapped
at
me
from
his
side
he
put
his
left
hand
out
over
their
heads
and
pressed
them
down
you
must
not
bark
at
my
friend
mallock
he
said
he
is
off
to
be
a
holy
monk
for
a
moment
i
thought
the
king
was
making
a
mock
of
me
but
it
was
not
so
he
was
smiling
at
me
very
friendly
he
was
in
wonderful
good
humour
that
evening
and
i
heard
more
of
his
public
talk
than
ever
before
for
he
made
me
draw
up
a
stool
presently
upon
the
hearth
now
and
again
a
gentleman
came
across
to
be
presented
to
him
and
others
came
and
looked
in
for
a
while
and
away
again
there
were
constant
comings
and
goings
and
once
as
a
french
boy
was
singing
songs
to
a
spinet
near
the
door
i
saw
the
serious
face
of
evelyn
with
two
of
his
friends
look
in
upon
the
scene
i
can
not
remember
one
quarter
of
all
the
things
that
were
said
now
the
king
was
silent
playing
with
the
ears
of
his
dogs
and
smiling
to
himself
now
he
would
say
little
things
that
stuck
in
the
memory
god
knows
why
for
example
he
said
that
he
had
eaten
two
goose
eggs
for
supper
which
shewed
what
a
strong
stomach
he
had
and
he
described
to
us
a
very
fierce
duck
that
had
snapped
his
hand
that
afternoon
in
the
park
history
is
not
made
of
these
things
and
yet
sometimes
i
think
that
it
should
be
for
those
be
the
matters
that
interest
little
folk
and
most
of
us
are
no
more
than
that
i
do
not
suppose
that
in
all
the
world
there
is
one
person
except
myself
who
knows
that
his
sacred
majesty
ate
two
goose
eggs
to
his
supper
on
that
sunday
night
he
spoke
presently
of
his
new
palace
at
winchester
that
he
was
and
that
was
near
finished
i
shall
be
very
happy
this
week
said
he
for
my
building
will
be
all
covered
in
with
lead
he
said
the
same
thing
again
later
to
my
lord
ailesbury
who
remembered
it
when
it
was
fulfilled
though
in
another
manner
than
the
king
had
meant
he
talked
too
of
little
ken
as
he
named
him
who
had
been
made
bishop
last
week
and
of
the
story
that
so
many
told
for
the
king
told
his
stories
several
times
over
when
he
was
in
a
good
humour
and
the
way
he
told
it
was
this
ah
that
little
ken
said
he
little
black
ken
he
is
the
man
to
tell
me
my
sins
your
grace
should
hear
him
added
he
upon
the
seventh
commandment
and
such
lessons
drawn
from
scripture
the
old
testament
he
looked
up
sharply
and
merrily
at
her
grace
of
portsmouth
as
he
said
this
well
when
poor
nell
and
i
went
down
to
winchester
a
good
while
ago
he
went
on
what
must
little
ken
do
but
refuse
her
a
lodging
this
is
a
man
to
be
a
bishop
thought
i
and
so
poor
nell
had
to
sleep
where
she
could
her
grace
of
portsmouth
looked
very
glum
while
this
tale
was
told
for
she
hated
nelly
with
all
her
heart
she
flounced
a
little
in
her
seat
and
one
of
the
dogs
barked
at
her
for
it
first
a
monk
and
then
a
duchess
said
the
king
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
good
man
of
salisbury
who
put
his
hand
into
my
carriage
to
greet
me
and
was
bitten
for
his
pains
bless
your
majesty
said
he
god
damn
your
majesty
dogs
eh
fubbs
for
so
he
called
the
duchess
so
he
discoursed
this
evening
very
freely
indeed
and
there
was
a
number
of
men
presently
behind
his
couch
listening
to
what
he
said
a
great
deal
of
what
he
said
can
not
be
set
down
here
for
it
was
extraordinary
indecent
as
well
as
profane
yet
there
was
a
wonderful
charm
about
his
manner
and
there
is
no
denying
it
and
in
this
i
suppose
lay
a
great
deal
of
the
injury
he
did
to
innocent
souls
for
it
all
seemed
nothing
but
merriment
and
his
quickness
of
conception
his
pleasantness
of
wit
his
variety
of
knowledge
his
tales
his
judgment
of
men
all
these
were
beyond
anything
that
i
have
ever
met
in
any
other
man
there
was
silence
made
every
now
and
then
for
the
french
boy
to
sing
another
song
and
this
singing
affected
me
very
deeply
so
long
as
i
did
not
look
at
the
lad
for
he
was
a
creature
all
dressed
up
like
a
doll
but
he
sang
wonderfully
clear
and
sweet
and
one
of
the
king
played
for
him
his
songs
were
all
in
french
and
the
substance
of
some
of
them
was
scarcely
decent
but
i
had
not
the
pain
of
hearing
any
that
i
had
heard
in
hare
street
during
the
singing
of
the
last
of
these
songs
near
midnight
again
that
mood
fell
on
me
that
all
was
but
a
painted
show
on
a
stage
and
that
reality
was
somewhere
else
the
great
chamber
was
pretty
hot
by
now
with
the
roaring
fire
and
all
the
folks
and
a
kind
of
steam
was
in
the
air
as
it
had
been
in
the
theatre
ten
days
ago
and
the
faces
were
some
of
them
flushed
and
some
of
them
pale
with
the
heat
the
duchess
of
cleveland
was
walking
up
and
down
before
the
fire
with
her
hands
clasped
as
if
she
were
restless
for
she
spoke
scarce
a
word
all
the
evening
when
the
song
was
done
the
king
clapped
his
hands
to
applaud
and
stood
up
and
all
stood
with
him
odd
fish
said
he
that
is
a
pretty
boy
and
a
pretty
song
then
he
gave
a
great
yawn
it
is
time
to
go
to
bed
said
he
as
he
said
that
the
door
from
the
outer
gallery
opened
and
i
saw
my
lord
ailesbury
there
a
young
man
very
languid
and
handsome
who
was
gentleman
of
the
bed
chamber
this
week
though
his
turn
ended
and
behind
him
sir
thomas
killigrew
who
was
groom
these
two
slept
in
the
king
bedchamber
all
night
and
two
or
three
pages
one
of
them
of
the
backstairs
my
lord
ailesbury
carried
a
tall
silver
candlestick
in
his
hand
with
the
candle
burning
in
it
he
bowed
to
his
majesty
did
i
not
say
so
said
the
king
he
did
not
give
his
hand
to
anyone
when
he
said
but
turned
and
bowed
a
little
to
the
company
about
him
on
the
hearth
and
they
back
to
him
the
three
duchesses
curtseying
very
low
but
to
me
he
gave
his
hand
to
kiss
mallock
said
he
in
a
loud
voice
then
raising
it
mallock
goes
abroad
or
is
it
tuesday
it
is
tuesday
sir
said
i
then
god
go
with
you
he
said
very
kindly
i
watched
him
go
out
to
the
door
with
his
hat
on
all
the
other
gentlemen
uncovered
and
bowing
to
him
and
him
nodding
and
smiling
in
very
good
humour
though
still
limping
a
little
and
my
heart
seemed
to
go
with
him
at
the
door
however
he
stopped
for
a
strange
thing
had
happened
as
my
lord
ailesbury
had
given
the
candle
to
the
page
who
was
to
go
before
them
it
had
suddenly
gone
out
though
there
was
no
draught
to
blow
it
the
page
looked
very
startled
and
afraid
and
shook
his
head
a
little
then
one
of
the
gentlemen
sprang
forward
and
took
a
candle
from
one
of
the
cressets
to
light
the
other
with
his
majesty
stood
smiling
while
this
was
done
but
he
said
nothing
when
it
was
lighted
he
turned
again
and
waved
his
hand
to
the
company
then
he
went
out
after
his
gentlemen
chapter
viii
it
was
a
little
after
eight
next
morning
that
i
heard
first
of
his
majesty
seizure
i
had
drunk
my
morning
and
was
on
the
point
of
going
out
with
my
man
indeed
i
was
descending
the
stairs
when
i
heard
steps
run
past
in
the
gallery
outside
and
then
another
man
also
running
i
came
out
as
he
went
past
and
saw
that
he
was
one
of
chiffinch
men
very
and
excited
i
cried
out
to
know
what
was
the
matter
but
he
shook
his
head
and
flapped
his
hand
at
me
as
if
he
could
not
stay
and
immediately
turned
off
from
the
gallery
and
ran
out
to
the
right
in
the
direction
of
the
king
lodgings
i
turned
to
my
man
james
who
was
just
behind
me
go
and
see
what
the
matter
is
i
said
for
after
seeing
the
king
so
well
and
cheerful
last
night
i
never
thought
of
any
illness
while
he
was
gone
i
waited
just
within
my
door
observing
one
of
my
engravings
with
my
hat
on
it
was
a
very
bitter
morning
in
less
than
five
minutes
james
was
back
again
very
white
and
breathing
fast
his
majesty
is
ill
said
he
chiffinch
i
heard
no
more
for
i
ran
out
past
him
at
a
great
pace
and
so
to
the
king
lodgings
when
i
came
to
the
door
of
them
all
was
in
confusion
there
was
but
one
guard
here
for
the
other
was
within
with
the
earl
of
craven
and
a
little
crowd
was
pestering
him
with
questions
i
made
no
bones
with
him
but
slipped
in
and
ran
upstairs
as
fast
as
i
could
there
was
no
one
in
the
first
antechamber
at
all
and
the
door
was
open
into
the
private
closet
beyond
it
was
contrary
to
all
etiquette
to
enter
this
unbidden
but
i
cared
nothing
for
that
and
ran
through
and
this
again
was
empty
so
i
passed
out
at
the
further
door
and
found
myself
at
the
head
of
a
little
stair
leading
down
into
a
wide
lobby
from
which
opened
out
two
or
three
chambers
with
the
king
bedchamber
at
the
further
end
and
here
in
the
lobby
i
ran
into
the
company
there
was
above
a
dozen
persons
there
at
least
all
talking
together
in
low
voices
but
i
saw
no
one
i
cared
to
speak
with
since
i
had
no
business
in
the
place
at
all
but
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
me
it
was
yet
pretty
dark
here
for
there
were
no
candles
so
i
waited
leaning
against
the
wall
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
then
the
voices
grew
louder
and
the
crowd
opened
out
a
little
to
let
someone
through
and
there
came
walking
very
quickly
and
talking
together
my
lord
craven
leaning
on
the
arm
of
my
lord
ailesbury
my
lord
craven
near
ninety
years
old
at
this
time
was
in
his
as
colonel
of
the
for
he
had
attended
a
few
minutes
before
to
receive
from
his
majesty
the
of
the
day
and
my
lord
ailesbury
was
but
half
dressed
with
his
points
hanging
loose
for
he
had
been
all
undressed
just
now
when
the
king
had
been
taken
after
they
had
passed
by
me
i
stood
again
to
wait
but
almost
immediately
across
the
further
end
of
the
lobby
i
saw
chiffinch
pass
swiftly
from
a
door
on
the
left
to
a
door
on
the
right
at
that
sight
i
determined
to
wait
no
longer
for
there
was
but
one
thought
in
my
mind
all
this
while
i
said
nothing
but
i
came
down
the
stairs
and
laid
my
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
a
physician
i
think
he
was
who
stood
in
front
of
me
and
pushed
him
aside
as
if
i
had
a
right
to
be
there
and
so
i
went
through
them
very
quickly
and
into
the
room
where
i
had
seen
chiffinch
go
the
door
was
ajar
i
pushed
it
open
and
went
in
it
was
a
pretty
small
room
and
there
were
no
beds
in
it
it
had
presses
round
the
walls
a
coal
fire
burned
in
the
hearth
in
a
brazier
and
a
round
table
was
in
the
midst
lit
by
a
single
candle
and
near
the
candle
stood
a
heap
of
surgical
instruments
and
a
roll
of
bandages
this
was
the
room
i
learned
later
next
to
the
royal
bedchamber
where
the
surgeons
had
attended
half
an
hour
ago
to
dress
the
king
heel
there
were
three
persons
in
the
room
beyond
the
table
talking
very
earnestly
together
two
of
them
i
did
not
know
but
the
third
was
chiffinch
they
all
three
turned
when
i
came
in
and
stared
at
me
why
began
the
page
mallock
what
do
you
he
came
towards
me
with
an
air
of
impatience
chiffinch
said
i
in
a
low
voice
how
is
his
majesty
i
the
further
door
which
stood
at
the
head
of
three
or
four
steps
leading
up
to
it
opened
sharply
and
the
page
whisked
round
to
see
what
it
was
a
face
looked
out
very
and
white
and
nodded
briskly
at
the
bandages
and
the
instruments
the
two
other
men
darted
at
those
seized
them
ran
up
the
stairs
and
vanished
leaving
the
door
but
a
crack
open
behind
them
then
chiffinch
turned
and
stared
at
me
again
he
appeared
very
pale
and
agitated
chiffinch
said
i
i
will
take
no
refusal
at
all
how
is
his
majesty
his
lips
worked
a
little
and
i
could
see
that
he
was
thinking
more
of
what
was
passing
in
the
chamber
beyond
than
of
my
presence
here
they
are
blooding
him
again
he
said
and
then
what
are
you
doing
here
i
took
him
by
the
lapel
of
his
coat
to
make
him
attend
to
me
for
his
eyes
were
wandering
back
like
a
mule
at
every
sound
behind
see
here
said
i
if
his
majesty
is
ill
it
is
time
to
send
for
a
priest
i
tell
you
priest
snapped
the
page
in
a
whisper
what
the
devil
i
shook
him
gently
by
his
coat
chiffinch
i
will
have
the
truth
is
the
king
dying
no
he
is
not
then
he
whispered
angrily
hark
he
tore
himself
free
darted
back
to
the
further
door
and
stood
there
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
with
his
head
lowered
listening
even
from
where
i
was
i
could
hear
a
gentle
sort
of
sound
as
of
moaning
or
very
heavy
breathing
and
then
a
sharp
whisper
or
two
and
then
the
noise
of
something
trickling
into
a
basin
presently
all
was
quiet
again
and
the
page
lifted
his
head
i
stood
where
i
was
for
i
know
how
it
is
with
men
in
a
sudden
anxiety
they
will
snap
and
snarl
and
then
all
at
once
turn
confidential
i
was
not
disappointed
after
he
had
waited
a
moment
or
two
he
came
towards
me
once
more
mallock
he
whispered
the
king
needs
no
priest
he
is
not
so
ill
as
that
and
he
is
unconscious
too
at
present
tell
me
i
said
again
he
glanced
behind
him
but
there
was
no
further
sound
he
came
a
little
nearer
his
majesty
was
taken
with
a
fit
soon
after
he
awakened
king
was
here
by
good
fortune
and
blooded
him
at
once
now
they
are
blooding
him
again
her
majesty
hath
been
sent
for
he
is
not
dying
you
will
swear
that
to
me
he
nodded
and
again
he
appeared
to
listen
i
took
him
by
his
button
again
chiffinch
said
i
you
must
attend
to
me
this
is
the
very
thing
i
have
waited
for
if
there
is
any
imminent
danger
you
must
send
for
a
priest
you
promise
me
that
he
shook
his
head
violently
so
i
tried
another
attack
well
i
said
then
you
will
allow
me
to
remain
here
is
the
duke
come
not
yet
said
he
ailesbury
is
gone
for
him
well
i
may
remain
then
there
came
a
knock
on
the
inner
side
of
the
further
door
and
he
tore
himself
free
again
but
i
was
after
him
and
seized
him
once
more
i
may
remain
yes
yes
he
snapped
as
you
will
let
me
go
sir
he
whisked
himself
out
of
my
hold
and
went
swiftly
up
the
stairs
and
through
the
door
shutting
it
behind
him
giving
me
but
the
smallest
glimpse
of
a
vast
room
and
men
heads
all
together
and
the
curtains
of
a
great
bed
near
the
door
but
i
was
content
i
had
got
my
way
as
i
walked
up
and
down
the
antechamber
very
softly
on
it
appeared
to
me
that
i
was
as
it
were
two
persons
in
one
on
the
one
side
there
was
the
conviction
and
the
determination
that
come
what
would
i
must
get
a
priest
to
the
king
if
he
took
a
turn
at
all
for
the
worse
since
for
the
present
i
believed
chiffinch
word
that
his
majesty
was
not
actually
dying
this
was
not
at
all
what
the
physicians
thought
at
that
time
but
i
did
not
know
that
this
conviction
i
suppose
had
always
been
with
me
that
it
was
for
this
that
in
providence
i
had
been
sent
to
england
at
least
seven
in
the
moment
that
i
had
left
my
house
and
run
down
the
gallery
there
it
was
all
and
mature
as
to
how
it
was
to
be
done
i
had
no
idea
at
all
yet
that
it
would
be
done
i
had
no
doubt
on
the
other
side
however
every
faculty
of
observation
that
i
had
was
alert
and
i
remember
the
very
pattern
of
the
carpet
i
walked
on
the
pictures
on
the
walls
and
the
carving
on
the
presses
above
all
i
remember
the
little
door
in
the
corner
of
the
chamber
the
third
and
how
i
opened
it
and
peeped
down
the
winding
staircase
that
led
from
it
i
did
not
know
then
what
part
that
little
door
and
winding
staircase
was
to
play
in
my
great
design
now
and
again
i
looked
out
of
the
single
window
at
the
river
beneath
in
the
early
morning
sunshine
now
i
paced
the
floor
again
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
found
a
very
pretty
post
of
observation
as
this
appeared
a
very
private
little
room
and
that
i
should
not
be
troubled
here
the
great
anterooms
i
knew
where
the
company
would
be
must
lie
on
the
further
side
of
the
bedchamber
i
suppose
it
would
be
about
five
minutes
after
chiffinch
had
left
me
that
her
majesty
came
the
first
i
knew
of
it
was
a
great
murmur
of
voices
and
footsteps
without
the
door
i
went
to
the
door
and
pulled
it
a
little
open
so
that
i
could
see
without
being
seen
and
looked
up
the
lobby
beyond
the
king
chamber
for
in
that
direction
i
knew
lay
her
majesty
apartments
a
couple
of
pages
came
first
very
hastily
with
rods
and
then
immediately
after
them
her
majesty
herself
hurrying
as
fast
as
she
could
scarce
decently
dressed
with
a
cloak
flung
over
all
with
a
hood
behind
her
came
two
or
three
of
her
ladies
i
saw
the
poor
woman
face
very
plain
for
a
moment
since
there
was
no
one
between
me
and
her
and
even
at
that
distance
i
could
see
her
miserable
agitation
her
brown
face
was
all
sallow
and
her
mouth
hung
open
then
she
whisked
after
the
pages
through
the
door
into
the
great
antechamber
that
lay
beyond
the
bedroom
i
went
back
again
to
shut
the
door
and
listen
at
the
other
for
i
knew
that
the
king
bed
was
close
to
it
though
he
was
not
in
it
at
this
time
but
still
in
the
barber
chair
where
he
had
been
blooded
and
presently
i
heard
the
poor
soul
begin
to
wail
aloud
i
heard
voices
too
as
if
soothing
her
for
all
the
physicians
were
there
and
half
a
dozen
others
but
the
wailing
grew
as
she
saw
i
suppose
in
what
condition
his
majesty
was
for
he
still
seemed
all
unconscious
till
she
began
to
shriek
that
was
a
terrible
sound
for
she
laughed
and
sobbed
too
all
at
once
in
a
kind
of
fit
i
could
hear
the
tone
very
plain
through
the
door
though
i
could
not
hear
what
she
said
and
the
voices
of
king
and
others
who
endeavoured
to
quiet
her
gradually
the
wailing
and
shrieking
grew
less
as
they
forced
her
away
and
out
again
till
i
heard
it
as
she
went
back
again
to
her
own
apartments
die
away
in
spasms
poor
soul
indeed
she
was
nothing
accounted
of
in
that
court
yet
she
loved
the
king
very
dearly
in
spite
of
his
neglect
towards
her
she
could
not
even
speak
to
him
i
heard
afterwards
though
he
had
spoken
her
name
and
asked
for
her
after
his
first
blooding
half
an
hour
later
in
the
meantime
no
one
had
come
in
to
me
and
i
could
only
walk
up
and
down
and
listen
as
well
as
i
could
i
heard
again
the
murmur
of
voices
in
the
lobby
and
steps
coming
swiftly
down
from
the
private
closet
again
i
was
in
time
at
the
door
to
see
who
it
was
that
went
by
and
it
was
the
duke
of
york
with
my
lord
ailesbury
who
had
gone
to
fetch
him
from
james
he
went
by
me
so
near
that
i
could
hear
his
quick
breathing
from
his
run
upstairs
and
he
had
come
in
such
a
hurry
that
he
had
only
one
shoe
on
and
on
the
other
foot
a
slipper
he
went
very
near
at
a
run
up
the
lobby
and
up
a
step
or
two
and
into
the
great
antechamber
and
so
round
to
the
bedchamber
and
i
presently
heard
him
enter
it
indeed
i
was
very
favourably
placed
for
observing
all
that
went
on
it
was
about
eleven
as
i
suppose
when
i
first
heard
his
majesty
voice
and
the
relief
of
it
to
me
was
extraordinary
i
had
ventured
up
the
stair
or
two
that
led
from
this
room
into
the
bedchamber
and
had
very
delicately
opened
the
door
a
crack
so
as
to
hear
more
plainly
but
i
dared
not
look
through
for
fear
that
i
should
be
seen
for
a
long
while
i
had
heard
nothing
but
whispers
and
once
the
yapping
of
a
little
dog
very
sharp
and
startling
but
the
noise
was
stifled
almost
immediately
and
the
dog
i
suppose
taken
out
at
the
other
door
once
or
twice
too
had
come
the
sudden
chiming
of
all
the
clocks
that
were
in
the
bedchamber
i
heard
first
a
great
groan
from
the
bed
to
which
by
now
they
had
moved
him
from
the
chair
and
then
ailesbury
name
spoken
in
a
very
broken
voice
my
own
heart
beat
so
loud
when
i
heard
that
that
i
could
scarce
listen
to
what
followed
yes
sir
came
ailesbury
voice
and
then
a
broken
murmur
again
he
was
thanking
him
i
heard
afterwards
from
chiffinch
for
his
affection
to
him
and
for
having
caused
him
to
be
bled
so
promptly
by
king
and
for
having
sent
chiffinch
to
him
to
bring
him
back
from
his
private
closet
presently
he
grew
stronger
and
i
could
hear
what
he
said
i
went
there
he
said
for
the
king
drops
i
felt
very
ailing
when
i
rose
i
walked
about
there
but
felt
no
better
i
nearly
fell
from
giddiness
as
i
came
down
again
he
spoke
very
slowly
but
strongly
enough
and
he
gave
a
great
sigh
at
the
end
presently
he
spoke
again
why
brother
he
said
so
there
you
are
i
heard
the
duke
voice
answer
him
but
so
brokenly
and
confusedly
that
i
could
hear
no
words
no
no
said
his
majesty
i
do
very
well
now
i
came
down
the
stairs
again
shaking
all
over
i
can
not
say
how
affected
i
was
to
hear
his
voice
again
and
i
think
there
could
scarce
be
a
man
in
the
place
any
less
affected
he
was
a
man
who
compelled
love
in
an
extraordinary
fashion
i
felt
that
if
he
died
i
could
bear
no
more
at
all
i
was
walking
up
and
down
again
very
softly
when
the
door
into
the
bedchamber
was
noiselessly
pulled
open
and
chiffinch
came
down
the
stairs
that
dreadful
look
of
tightness
and
pain
was
gone
from
his
face
he
was
almost
smiling
he
nodded
at
me
very
cheerful
he
is
better
the
king
majesty
is
much
better
he
whispered
then
his
face
twitched
with
emotion
and
i
saw
that
he
was
very
near
crying
i
was
not
far
from
it
myself
chapter
ix
how
the
hours
of
that
day
went
by
i
scarcely
know
at
all
i
went
back
to
dine
in
my
lodgings
and
to
all
preparations
for
my
going
on
the
morrow
so
soon
as
i
knew
that
his
majesty
was
out
of
any
immediate
danger
for
i
could
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
leave
town
until
he
was
altogether
recovered
in
the
afternoon
before
going
back
to
inquire
how
he
was
i
walked
a
good
while
in
the
court
and
the
privy
garden
though
the
day
was
very
raw
and
cold
whitehall
had
been
put
as
in
a
state
of
siege
from
the
first
moment
that
the
king
illness
was
known
the
gates
were
closed
to
all
but
those
who
had
lodgings
in
the
palace
and
those
who
were
allowed
special
entry
by
his
royal
highness
the
sentries
everywhere
were
greatly
augmented
both
horse
and
foot
were
placed
at
every
entrance
and
the
greatest
strictness
was
observed
that
no
letter
should
pass
out
either
to
his
grace
of
monmouth
or
to
the
prince
of
orange
even
barillon
had
but
permission
to
send
one
letter
to
the
french
king
as
to
his
state
all
this
was
to
hinder
any
rising
or
invasion
that
might
be
made
either
within
or
without
the
kingdom
i
was
in
the
court
when
the
couriers
rode
out
with
despatches
to
the
lords
lieutenant
of
the
counties
with
advices
as
to
what
to
do
should
his
majesty
die
and
i
was
there
too
when
the
deputies
came
from
the
lord
mayor
and
aldermen
and
lieutenants
of
the
city
to
inquire
for
the
king
and
to
assure
his
royal
highness
of
their
loyalty
and
support
this
was
of
the
greatest
satisfaction
to
the
duke
for
i
suppose
that
he
did
not
feel
very
secure
a
little
before
supper
i
went
round
to
chiffinch
and
by
the
greatest
good
fortune
found
him
on
the
point
of
returning
to
his
majesty
lodgings
he
gave
me
an
excellent
account
as
we
went
together
the
physicians
declare
said
he
that
his
majesty
is
out
of
danger
and
bath
permitted
the
duke
to
tell
the
foreign
ministers
so
they
have
had
another
consultation
on
him
and
have
prescribed
god
knows
what
cowslip
and
sal
of
ammoniac
sneezing
mixtures
plasters
for
his
feet
and
he
is
to
have
broth
and
ale
to
his
supper
they
are
determined
to
catch
hold
of
his
disorder
somehow
if
not
by
one
thing
then
by
another
to
tell
the
truth
i
think
they
know
not
at
all
what
is
the
matter
with
him
they
have
taken
near
thirty
ounces
of
blood
from
him
too
if
the
king
were
not
a
giant
for
health
he
would
have
died
of
his
remedies
i
think
he
talked
so
but
he
was
in
very
cheerful
spirits
and
before
he
left
me
at
the
door
of
the
lodgings
i
had
got
an
order
from
him
to
admit
me
everywhere
within
reason
it
was
something
of
a
surprise
to
me
to
see
how
dearly
this
man
whose
name
was
so
evil
spoken
of
and
i
fear
with
good
cause
enough
yet
loved
his
master
on
tuesday
morning
i
was
up
again
very
early
and
round
at
his
lodgings
i
went
up
by
the
other
way
and
into
the
great
antechamber
and
there
i
met
with
one
of
the
physicians
who
was
just
come
from
the
consultation
that
twelve
of
them
had
held
together
he
was
a
very
communicative
fellow
and
told
me
that
six
of
them
had
been
with
his
majesty
all
night
and
that
his
majesty
had
slept
pretty
well
and
that
to
encourage
him
i
suppose
ten
more
ounces
of
blood
had
been
taken
from
his
neck
he
was
proceeding
to
speak
of
some
new
remedies
and
mentioned
an
julep
of
black
cherry
water
that
had
been
prescribed
when
another
put
out
his
head
and
called
to
him
from
the
bedchamber
and
he
went
away
back
into
it
with
an
important
air
all
that
day
too
i
never
left
whitehall
there
were
great
crowds
in
all
the
streets
and
outside
the
gates
i
heard
but
their
demeanour
was
very
quiet
and
sorrowful
and
prayers
were
said
all
day
long
in
the
churches
when
i
went
back
to
the
antechamber
in
the
evening
i
saw
my
lord
bishop
of
ely
there
and
heard
from
one
of
the
pages
that
he
was
to
spend
that
night
in
his
majesty
room
so
i
gathered
from
that
that
the
physicians
were
not
very
confident
even
yet
though
couriers
had
been
sent
out
again
to
bear
the
news
of
the
king
happy
recovery
and
i
was
besides
in
two
minds
when
i
saw
the
bishop
there
as
to
what
i
should
do
about
a
catholic
priest
if
i
had
seen
his
royal
highness
then
i
think
i
should
have
said
something
to
him
upon
it
but
the
duke
was
in
the
bedchamber
and
there
i
dared
not
yet
penetrate
on
the
wednesday
morning
when
i
went
early
to
inquire
i
heard
that
again
his
majesty
had
slept
well
and
that
the
physicians
were
well
satisfied
i
saw
no
one
but
a
man
of
chiffinch
who
told
me
that
and
that
ken
my
lord
bishop
of
bath
and
wells
was
with
the
king
and
i
went
away
content
but
when
i
went
back
again
for
the
third
time
that
day
just
before
i
saw
from
the
faces
in
the
antechamber
that
all
was
not
so
well
yet
i
could
get
nothing
out
of
anyone
and
did
not
wish
to
press
too
hard
lest
i
should
be
turned
out
altogether
i
saw
my
friend
of
yesterday
whose
name
i
have
never
yet
learned
hurrying
across
the
end
of
the
chamber
into
another
little
room
where
the
physicians
had
their
consultations
it
was
i
think
my
lord
ailesbury
but
i
was
not
in
time
to
catch
him
so
i
went
away
again
in
some
little
dismay
yet
not
greatly
alarmed
even
now
the
bishop
i
thought
could
at
least
do
him
no
great
harm
on
the
thursday
morning
before
i
was
dressed
my
man
brought
me
the
that
had
been
printed
about
six
the
evening
before
the
announcement
as
to
the
king
health
ran
as
follows
i
cut
out
the
passage
then
and
there
and
put
it
in
my
diary
at
the
council
chamber
whitehall
the
of
february
at
five
in
the
afternoon
the
lords
of
his
majesty
most
honourable
privy
council
have
thought
fit
for
preventing
false
reports
i
make
known
that
his
majesty
upon
monday
morning
last
was
seized
with
a
violent
fit
that
gave
great
cause
to
fear
the
issue
of
it
but
after
some
hours
an
amendment
appeared
which
with
the
blessing
of
god
being
improved
by
the
application
of
proper
and
seasonable
remedies
is
now
so
advanced
that
the
physicians
have
this
day
as
well
as
yesterday
given
this
account
to
the
council
that
they
conceive
his
majesty
to
be
in
a
condition
of
safety
and
that
he
will
in
a
few
days
be
freed
from
his
distemper
john
nicholas
yes
thought
i
that
is
all
very
well
but
what
of
yesterday
after
five
and
what
of
this
morning
as
i
went
to
his
majesty
lodgings
an
hour
afterwards
i
heard
the
bells
from
the
churches
beginning
to
peal
to
call
the
folks
to
give
thanks
yet
the
faces
within
the
palace
were
very
different
when
i
went
up
into
the
great
antechamber
the
physicians
were
just
dispersing
and
by
good
fortune
i
was
at
hand
when
my
lord
keeper
north
questioned
sir
charles
scarburgh
as
he
went
back
to
his
majesty
chamber
well
said
he
very
short
what
do
you
say
my
lord
said
sir
charles
we
conclude
that
his
majesty
hath
an
intermittent
fever
and
what
the
devil
of
that
asked
my
lord
could
anything
be
worse
there
was
a
little
group
round
them
by
now
and
i
could
see
one
of
the
bishops
listening
a
little
way
off
my
lord
said
the
other
at
least
we
know
now
what
to
do
and
what
is
that
snapped
my
lord
who
seemed
in
a
very
ill
humour
to
give
the
cortex
my
lord
said
sir
charles
with
great
dignity
for
indeed
the
manner
of
my
lord
was
most
insolent
my
lord
grunted
at
that
peruvian
bark
my
lord
said
the
physician
as
if
speaking
to
a
child
well
there
was
no
more
to
be
got
that
morning
i
was
in
and
out
for
a
little
again
in
two
minds
as
to
what
to
do
his
royal
highness
went
through
the
antechamber
at
one
time
to
meet
barillon
as
i
saw
presently
and
conduct
him
to
the
king
chamber
a
little
before
dinner
but
at
such
a
quickness
and
with
such
sorrow
in
his
face
that
i
dared
not
speak
to
him
i
went
back
to
dinner
and
fell
asleep
afterwards
in
my
chair
so
greatly
was
i
wearied
out
with
anxiety
and
did
not
wake
till
near
four
then
thank
god
i
did
awake
and
with
all
speed
went
again
to
his
majesty
lodgings
and
this
time
guided
i
suppose
by
divine
providence
for
i
had
no
clear
intention
in
what
i
did
i
went
up
the
private
way
through
the
king
closet
where
i
found
no
one
down
the
steps
and
so
into
the
little
chamber
where
i
had
talked
with
chiffinch
on
the
first
morning
of
his
distemper
the
chamber
was
empty
but
immediately
after
i
had
entered
first
knocking
and
getting
no
answer
who
should
come
through
his
face
all
distorted
with
sorrow
but
chiffinch
himself
there
was
but
one
candle
on
the
table
but
by
its
light
i
saw
how
it
was
with
him
i
went
up
immediately
and
took
him
by
the
arms
he
stared
at
me
like
a
terrified
child
my
friend
said
i
i
must
have
no
further
delay
you
must
take
me
to
his
majesty
he
shook
his
head
violently
but
he
could
not
speak
as
for
me
all
my
resolution
rose
up
as
never
before
i
gripped
him
tighter
i
ask
but
five
minutes
i
said
but
that
i
must
have
i
i
can
not
said
he
very
low
i
let
go
of
him
and
went
straight
towards
the
steps
that
led
up
into
his
majesty
room
as
i
reached
the
foot
of
them
he
had
seized
my
arm
from
behind
where
are
you
going
he
whispered
sharply
that
is
the
way
to
the
king
room
i
turned
and
looked
at
him
yes
i
said
very
slowly
i
know
that
well
well
you
can
not
he
stammered
then
you
must
take
me
i
said
he
still
stared
at
me
as
if
either
he
or
i
were
mad
then
of
a
sudden
his
face
changed
and
he
nodded
i
could
see
how
distraught
he
was
and
unsettled
i
will
take
you
he
whispered
i
will
take
you
mallock
for
god
sake
mallock
he
went
up
the
steps
before
me
in
his
soft
shoes
and
i
went
after
as
quietly
as
i
could
as
he
put
his
hand
on
the
handle
he
turned
again
for
christ
sake
he
whispered
in
a
terrible
soft
voice
for
christ
sake
it
must
be
but
five
minutes
i
am
sent
to
fetch
the
bishops
mr
mallock
he
opened
the
door
a
little
and
peered
in
i
could
see
nothing
so
dark
was
the
chamber
within
but
the
candles
at
the
further
end
and
a
few
faces
far
away
a
great
curtain
as
a
wall
shut
off
all
view
to
my
left
quick
mallock
he
whispered
turning
back
to
me
this
side
of
the
bed
is
clear
go
in
quick
he
is
turned
on
this
side
i
will
fetch
you
out
this
way
again
he
was
his
own
man
again
swift
and
prompt
and
steady
as
for
me
the
beating
of
my
heart
made
me
near
sick
then
i
felt
myself
pushed
within
the
chamber
and
heard
the
door
close
softly
behind
me
at
first
i
could
see
nothing
on
this
side
as
i
had
been
staring
over
the
candle
just
now
except
a
group
of
persons
at
the
further
end
of
the
great
room
and
among
them
the
white
of
a
bishop
rochet
and
the
candlelight
and
firelight
on
the
roof
the
clocks
were
all
chiming
four
as
i
came
in
and
drowned
i
suppose
the
sounds
of
my
coming
then
almost
immediately
i
saw
that
the
curtains
were
drawn
back
on
this
side
of
the
great
bed
that
stood
in
this
end
of
the
room
and
that
they
were
partly
drawn
forward
on
the
other
side
so
as
to
shroud
from
the
candlelight
him
who
lay
within
them
and
beneath
the
royal
arms
of
england
emblazoned
on
the
state
and
then
i
saw
him
he
was
lying
over
on
this
side
of
the
bed
propped
on
high
pillows
but
leaning
all
over
and
breathing
loudly
his
left
arm
was
flung
over
the
coverlet
and
his
fingers
contracted
and
opened
and
contracted
again
i
went
forward
swiftly
and
noiselessly
threw
myself
on
my
knees
laid
my
hand
softly
beneath
his
and
kissed
it
eh
eh
murmured
the
heavy
voice
who
is
it
i
saw
the
curtain
on
the
other
side
pulled
a
little
and
the
face
of
sir
charles
scarburgh
all
in
shadow
peer
in
it
looked
very
lean
and
sharp
and
the
king
flapped
his
hand
in
a
gesture
of
dismissal
and
the
face
vanished
again
sir
whispered
i
very
earnestly
yet
so
low
that
i
think
none
but
he
could
have
heard
me
sir
it
is
roger
mallock
mallock
repeated
the
voice
yet
so
low
that
it
could
not
have
been
understood
by
any
but
me
his
face
was
very
near
to
me
and
it
was
shockingly
lined
and
patched
and
the
eyes
terribly
hollow
and
languid
but
there
was
intelligence
in
them
sir
said
i
you
spoke
to
me
once
of
an
apostleship
so
i
did
murmured
the
voice
so
i
sir
i
am
come
to
fulfill
it
it
is
not
too
late
sir
the
bishops
are
sent
for
have
nothing
to
say
to
them
sir
let
me
get
you
a
true
priest
for
christ
sake
the
cold
fingers
that
i
yet
held
twitched
and
pressed
on
mine
i
was
sure
that
he
understood
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
what
of
poor
little
ken
he
murmured
poor
little
ken
he
will
break
his
heart
if
he
may
not
say
his
prayers
let
him
say
what
he
will
sir
but
no
sacrament
let
me
send
for
a
priest
there
was
a
long
silence
he
sighed
once
or
twice
his
fingers
all
the
while
twitched
in
mine
pressing
on
them
and
opening
again
ah
how
i
prayed
in
my
heart
to
mary
conceived
without
sin
to
pray
for
this
poor
soul
that
had
such
a
load
on
him
the
minutes
were
passing
i
thought
maybe
he
was
unconscious
again
and
the
bishops
if
they
were
in
the
palace
might
be
here
at
any
instant
and
all
undone
i
am
not
ashamed
to
say
that
i
entreated
even
my
own
dear
love
to
pray
for
us
she
had
laid
down
her
life
in
his
service
and
mine
might
it
not
be
thought
i
even
in
this
agony
that
by
god
permission
she
were
near
to
help
me
he
stirred
again
at
last
going
to
be
a
monk
said
he
going
to
be
a
monk
roger
mallock
pray
for
me
roger
mallock
when
you
be
a
monk
sir
he
went
on
as
if
he
had
not
heard
me
yes
murmured
he
a
very
good
idea
but
you
will
never
do
it
go
to
fubbs
roger
mallock
fubbs
will
do
it
for
a
priest
sir
whispered
i
scarcely
able
to
believe
that
he
meant
it
yes
he
murmured
again
for
a
priest
yes
for
god
sake
fubbs
will
do
it
fubbs
is
always
his
voice
trailed
off
into
silence
once
more
and
his
fingers
relaxed
at
the
same
instant
i
heard
the
door
open
softly
behind
and
turning
i
saw
the
page
face
again
lean
and
anxious
peering
in
at
me
then
his
finger
appeared
in
the
line
of
light
beckoning
i
kissed
the
loose
cold
fingers
once
again
rose
up
and
went
out
on
chapter
x
then
began
for
me
the
most
amazing
adventure
of
all
my
adventures
had
indeed
been
very
surprising
some
of
them
and
my
last
i
had
thought
to
be
the
greatest
of
all
and
the
most
in
the
yard
of
the
theatre
royal
i
had
thought
that
that
had
drained
the
last
energy
from
me
and
that
i
had
no
desires
left
except
of
the
peace
of
the
cloister
and
death
itself
yet
after
my
words
with
the
king
and
his
to
me
there
awakened
that
in
me
which
i
had
thought
already
dead
a
fierce
overmastering
ambition
to
accomplish
one
more
task
that
was
the
greatest
of
them
all
and
to
get
salvation
to
the
man
who
had
again
and
again
flouted
and
neglected
me
whom
yet
i
loved
as
i
had
never
yet
loved
any
man
as
i
went
to
and
fro
as
i
shall
now
relate
until
i
saw
him
again
there
went
with
me
the
vision
of
him
and
of
his
fallen
face
there
in
the
shadow
of
the
great
bed
and
there
went
with
me
too
i
think
the
eager
presence
of
my
own
love
near
as
warm
as
in
life
what
shall
we
do
next
what
shall
we
do
next
dolly
i
caught
myself
murmuring
more
than
once
as
i
ran
here
and
there
and
i
had
almost
sworn
that
she
whispered
back
to
me
and
that
her
breath
was
in
my
hair
within
five
minutes
of
my
having
left
the
king
bedchamber
i
was
running
up
the
stairs
to
her
grace
of
portsmouth
lodgings
i
had
said
scarce
a
word
to
chiffinch
when
i
came
out
into
the
little
anteroom
except
that
i
was
sent
on
a
message
by
his
majesty
and
he
stared
on
me
as
if
i
were
mad
then
i
was
out
again
by
the
private
way
through
the
closet
and
the
rooms
beyond
and
down
the
staircase
at
the
door
of
her
grace
lodgings
there
stood
a
sentry
who
lowered
his
pike
as
i
came
up
to
bar
my
way
out
of
the
way
man
i
cried
at
him
i
am
on
his
majesty
business
he
too
stared
on
me
and
faltered
lifting
his
pike
a
little
all
were
distraught
by
the
news
that
was
run
like
fire
about
the
place
that
the
king
was
dying
or
he
would
never
have
let
me
through
but
i
was
past
him
before
he
could
change
his
mind
again
and
through
a
compile
of
antechambers
in
one
of
which
a
page
started
up
to
know
my
business
but
i
was
past
him
as
if
he
were
no
more
than
a
shadow
then
i
was
in
the
great
gallery
where
i
had
sat
with
the
king
and
his
company
but
four
days
ago
it
presented
a
very
different
appearance
now
then
it
had
been
all
ablaze
with
lights
and
merry
with
laughter
and
music
now
it
was
lit
by
but
a
pair
of
candles
over
the
hearth
and
the
glow
of
a
dying
fire
overhead
the
high
roof
glimmered
into
darkness
and
the
gorgeous
furniture
was
no
more
than
dimness
i
stopped
short
on
the
threshold
bewildered
at
the
gloom
thinking
that
the
chamber
was
empty
then
i
saw
that
a
woman
had
raised
herself
from
the
great
couch
on
which
the
king
had
lolled
with
his
little
dogs
last
sunday
night
and
was
staring
at
me
like
a
ghost
at
that
sight
i
ran
forward
and
kneeled
down
on
one
knee
madame
i
said
in
french
his
majesty
hath
sent
me
at
that
she
was
up
and
had
me
by
the
shoulders
her
face
was
ghastly
all
slobbered
over
with
crying
and
her
eyes
sunken
and
her
lips
pale
as
wax
god
knows
what
she
was
dressed
in
for
i
do
not
his
majesty
she
cried
his
majesty
he
is
not
dead
for
the
love
of
god
i
stood
up
she
still
gripped
me
like
a
fury
no
madame
said
i
his
majesty
is
not
dead
he
hath
sent
me
i
spoke
with
him
not
five
minutes
ago
but
he
is
very
near
death
he
hath
sent
for
me
he
hath
sent
for
me
she
screamed
as
if
in
mingled
joy
and
terror
no
madame
but
he
hath
sent
to
you
his
majesty
desires
you
to
get
him
a
priest
her
hands
relaxed
and
fell
to
her
side
i
do
not
know
what
she
thought
i
do
not
judge
her
but
i
thought
that
she
hesitated
i
fell
on
my
knees
again
and
seized
her
hand
i
would
have
kneeled
to
the
devil
if
he
could
have
helped
me
then
madame
for
the
love
of
christ
do
as
the
king
asks
he
desires
a
priest
for
the
love
of
christ
madame
she
was
still
silent
for
an
instant
staring
down
on
me
then
she
tore
her
hand
free
and
i
thought
she
would
refuse
me
but
she
caught
me
again
by
the
shoulders
stand
up
sir
stand
up
i
i
will
do
whatever
the
king
desires
but
what
can
i
do
god
there
is
someone
coming
there
came
very
plainly
through
the
antechambers
i
had
just
run
through
the
tramp
of
feet
i
stood
as
in
a
paralysis
not
knowing
what
to
do
next
then
she
seized
on
me
again
as
the
steps
came
near
stand
back
she
said
stand
back
sir
i
must
see
there
came
a
knocking
on
the
door
as
i
sprang
back
away
from
the
hearth
and
stood
out
of
the
firelight
then
the
door
opened
as
her
grace
made
no
answer
and
the
page
whom
i
had
seen
just
now
stood
bowing
upon
the
threshold
madame
said
he
barillon
the
french
ambassador
she
made
a
swift
gesture
and
he
fell
back
there
was
a
pause
and
then
through
the
door
came
barillon
very
upright
and
lean
walking
quickly
all
alone
he
stopped
short
when
he
saw
her
grace
put
his
heels
together
and
bowed
very
low
she
was
at
him
in
an
instant
monsieur
she
cried
yon
are
come
in
the
very
nick
of
time
how
is
his
majesty
he
said
nothing
as
he
walked
with
her
towards
the
hearth
she
stood
waiting
with
her
hands
clasped
and
a
face
of
extraordinary
anguish
madame
he
said
there
is
very
bad
news
i
am
come
on
behalf
of
his
majesty
king
louis
sh
she
hissed
at
him
with
a
quick
gesture
to
where
i
stood
he
had
not
observed
me
he
straightened
himself
as
he
saw
me
and
then
bowed
a
little
the
duchess
went
on
with
extraordinary
rapidity
still
talking
in
french
this
is
mallock
said
she
mallock
but
just
now
come
from
his
majesty
he
brings
me
very
grave
news
monsieur
barillon
you
will
help
us
will
you
not
you
will
help
us
surely
all
her
anguish
had
passed
into
an
extraordinary
pleading
she
was
as
a
child
begging
for
life
madame
began
the
ambassador
ah
listen
monsieur
the
king
desires
a
priest
he
is
a
catholic
at
heart
you
know
he
hath
been
a
catholic
at
heart
a
long
time
ever
since
she
broke
off
you
will
help
us
will
you
not
monsieur
he
threw
out
his
hands
but
she
paid
no
attention
monsieur
i
swear
to
you
that
it
is
so
yet
what
can
i
do
i
can
not
go
to
him
with
decency
the
queen
is
there
continually
i
hear
the
duke
is
taken
up
with
a
thousand
affairs
and
does
not
think
of
it
go
to
the
duke
i
entreat
you
monsieur
go
to
the
duke
and
tell
him
what
i
say
mallock
shall
go
with
you
he
is
a
friend
of
the
duke
he
will
bear
me
out
monsieur
for
the
love
of
god
lose
no
time
come
and
see
me
again
but
go
now
or
it
may
be
too
late
monsieur
i
entreat
you
she
had
seized
him
by
the
arm
as
she
spoke
even
his
rigid
face
twitched
a
little
at
the
violence
of
her
pleading
i
knew
well
what
was
in
his
mind
and
how
he
wondered
whether
he
dared
do
as
she
asked
him
god
knew
what
complications
might
follow
monsieur
he
nodded
suddenly
and
sharply
madame
said
he
i
will
go
mallock
he
bowed
to
me
ah
god
bless
you
sir
he
stooped
suddenly
to
her
hand
lifted
it
and
kissed
it
i
think
in
that
moment
something
of
the
compassion
of
the
saviour
himself
fell
on
him
for
this
poor
woman
who
yet
might
be
forgiven
much
for
indeed
under
all
her
foolishness
and
sin
she
loved
very
ardently
then
he
wheeled
and
went
out
of
the
room
again
and
i
followed
no
sound
came
from
the
duchess
as
we
left
her
there
in
the
half
lit
twilight
she
was
standing
with
her
hands
clasped
staring
after
us
as
we
went
out
he
said
nothing
as
we
passed
again
through
the
anterooms
and
down
the
stairs
then
as
we
went
on
through
the
next
gallery
he
spoke
to
me
his
men
were
a
good
way
behind
us
and
another
in
front
mallock
said
he
for
he
had
known
me
well
enough
in
france
his
majesty
told
you
this
himself
yes
sir
said
i
not
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
then
the
duke
is
our
only
chance
he
said
he
said
no
more
till
we
came
to
the
great
antechamber
by
the
bedroom
it
was
half
full
of
people
but
the
duke
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
i
waited
by
the
door
as
barillon
went
forward
and
spoke
to
someone
then
he
came
back
to
me
the
duke
is
with
the
queen
he
said
we
must
go
to
him
there
it
was
enough
to
send
a
man
mad
so
to
seek
person
after
person
in
such
a
simple
matter
as
this
why
in
god
name
i
wondered
might
not
even
a
king
die
in
what
religion
he
liked
without
all
this
plotting
and
conspiring
was
i
never
to
be
free
from
these
things
at
the
door
to
the
queen
apartments
barillon
turned
to
me
you
had
best
wait
here
sir
he
said
i
will
speak
with
the
duke
privately
first
he
was
admitted
instantly
so
soon
as
he
knocked
and
went
through
leaving
me
in
a
little
gallery
of
all
that
went
through
my
mind
as
i
walked
up
and
down
with
a
page
watching
me
from
the
door
i
can
give
no
account
at
all
again
one
half
of
my
attention
was
fixed
though
with
out
any
coherency
on
the
business
i
was
at
the
other
half
observed
the
carpet
under
my
feet
the
cabinets
along
the
wall
and
the
pictures
it
was
not
near
as
splendid
as
were
the
rooms
i
had
left
so
short
a
while
ago
i
had
not
to
wait
long
there
was
a
sudden
talking
of
voices
beyond
the
door
that
the
ambassador
had
just
passed
through
and
i
heard
the
tones
very
plain
then
the
page
stiffened
to
attention
the
door
was
flung
open
suddenly
and
the
duke
came
out
alone
at
a
great
pace
leaving
the
door
open
behind
him
he
never
saw
me
at
all
the
page
darted
after
him
and
the
two
disappeared
together
round
the
corner
in
the
direction
of
the
king
rooms
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
barillon
came
out
and
beckoned
to
me
and
together
we
went
up
and
down
the
gallery
you
are
perfectly
right
sir
he
said
his
royal
highness
shewed
great
sorrow
for
not
leaving
thought
of
it
he
is
gone
instantly
to
his
majesty
he
will
fetch
a
priest
he
will
speak
to
his
majesty
first
he
will
find
out
at
least
what
he
thinks
but
good
god
said
i
his
majesty
hath
told
me
himself
what
he
wishes
you
must
let
his
royal
highness
do
it
in
his
own
way
he
said
he
must
not
be
pushed
but
i
think
you
have
done
the
trick
mr
mallock
how
is
her
majesty
i
asked
abruptly
the
physicians
have
been
at
her
too
he
said
dryly
she
had
a
just
now
in
his
majesty
presence
and
they
have
been
blooding
her
what
priest
can
be
got
i
asked
next
he
made
a
gesture
towards
the
chamber
he
had
just
come
out
of
there
is
a
pack
of
them
in
there
he
said
next
to
her
private
closet
they
have
been
praying
all
day
in
the
oratory
it
was
fallen
dark
by
now
for
it
was
long
after
five
and
there
were
no
candles
lighted
here
we
went
up
and
down
a
good
while
longer
for
the
most
part
in
silence
speaking
of
this
and
that
and
i
will
not
deny
that
we
talked
a
little
of
french
affairs
though
god
knows
i
was
in
no
heart
for
that
and
answered
very
indifferently
it
appeared
to
me
extraordinary
that
a
man
could
think
of
such
little
things
as
the
affairs
of
kingdoms
when
an
immortal
soul
was
at
stake
a
little
before
six
when
at
last
the
servants
brought
lights
the
ambassador
left
me
again
to
go
in
to
see
the
queen
leaving
me
to
watch
for
the
duke
and
i
had
not
very
long
to
wait
for
soon
after
i
had
heard
a
clock
chime
the
hour
his
royal
highness
came
again
walking
very
quickly
as
before
and
when
he
saw
me
waiting
there
beckoned
me
to
follow
him
we
went
through
two
or
three
rooms
all
lighted
up
and
empty
the
duke
sending
a
page
to
fetch
barillon
out
of
the
private
closet
where
he
was
talking
with
her
into
a
little
chamber
that
looked
out
upon
the
court
where
there
was
a
fire
lighted
we
had
hardly
got
there
before
the
ambassador
came
all
in
haste
to
hear
what
had
been
done
i
have
spoken
with
his
majesty
said
the
duke
looking
very
white
and
drawn
in
the
face
he
is
in
most
excellent
dispositions
he
tells
me
that
he
hath
put
off
the
bishops
and
has
not
received
the
sacrament
from
them
and
will
not
and
what
of
a
priest
sir
asked
the
ambassador
sharply
i
did
not
speak
to
him
of
that
answered
the
duke
so
pompously
that
i
raged
to
hear
him
he
said
that
ken
hath
read
prayers
over
him
and
told
him
that
he
need
make
no
confession
unless
he
willed
and
that
he
willed
not
and
did
not
but
that
ken
read
an
absolution
over
him
which
he
values
not
at
a
straw
sir
said
i
very
boldly
this
is
very
pretty
talk
but
it
is
not
a
priest
his
majesty
wishes
for
a
priest
he
told
me
so
himself
the
duke
turned
on
me
very
hotly
eh
sir
i
made
haste
to
swallow
down
my
wrath
sir
i
said
i
did
not
mean
to
be
discourteous
but
i
assure
your
royal
highness
that
the
king
said
so
to
me
expressly
it
is
his
immortal
soul
that
is
at
stake
then
i
understood
what
was
the
matter
the
duke
flung
out
his
hands
as
if
in
despair
but
what
can
i
do
he
cried
i
am
watched
every
instant
they
will
not
leave
me
alone
with
him
ken
eyed
me
very
sharply
they
suspect
something
i
know
they
do
from
my
brother
having
refused
their
ministrations
how
can
i
get
a
priest
to
him
then
again
by
god
inspiration
as
i
truly
believe
a
thought
came
to
me
sir
i
said
i
myself
spoke
with
the
king
a
while
ago
and
i
do
not
think
that
a
soul
saw
who
i
was
i
came
through
the
little
door
at
the
back
of
the
bed
why
should
not
the
ambassador
struck
his
hands
together
he
said
i
believe
mallock
hath
hit
it
again
the
duke
turned
and
eyed
me
very
sternly
well
sir
what
is
your
plan
sir
i
said
let
the
chamber
be
cleared
or
almost
then
let
barillon
here
go
in
as
if
he
had
a
message
from
the
french
king
while
he
is
there
let
a
priest
be
brought
by
the
back
way
not
through
the
antechamber
at
all
barillon
held
up
his
hand
there
would
not
be
time
he
said
it
does
not
take
half
an
hour
to
deliver
a
message
and
the
priest
business
would
take
full
half
an
hour
no
no
cried
james
they
would
suspect
something
let
her
majesty
come
again
to
take
her
leave
of
the
king
and
then
i
will
go
in
after
for
the
same
thing
while
we
are
there
let
the
priest
come
as
mallock
has
said
sir
said
the
ambassador
we
must
not
have
too
many
folks
in
this
business
all
this
bargaining
drove
me
near
mad
once
more
i
broke
in
and
this
time
with
more
effect
sir
i
said
to
the
duke
i
entreat
you
to
hear
me
there
is
the
little
room
at
the
back
of
his
majesty
bed
all
ready
and
empty
too
we
do
not
need
all
these
devices
if
you
sir
will
go
to
the
king
and
prepare
him
for
it
i
will
find
a
priest
and
bring
him
up
the
other
way
i
do
not
believe
that
even
if
there
were
folks
in
the
bedchamber
they
would
hear
what
passed
which
way
would
the
priest
come
asked
the
duke
there
is
a
little
stair
in
the
corner
of
the
room
god
there
is
cried
the
duke
i
had
forgotten
it
we
stared
on
one
another
in
silence
my
mind
raced
like
a
mill
then
once
more
the
duke
near
ruined
the
whole
design
by
his
diplomacy
gentlemen
he
said
we
are
too
precipitate
his
majesty
hath
not
yet
told
me
that
he
wishes
for
a
priest
sir
i
began
in
desperation
he
looked
at
me
so
fiercely
that
i
stopped
listen
to
me
said
he
very
imperiously
i
will
have
it
my
own
way
barillon
do
you
come
with
me
now
to
his
majesty
i
will
bid
the
company
withdraw
into
the
antechamber
bishops
and
all
on
the
pretext
that
i
wish
to
consult
with
my
brother
privately
barillon
shall
be
in
the
doorway
that
none
may
come
through
mallock
shall
be
with
the
company
and
hear
what
they
say
then
if
the
king
wishes
for
a
priest
we
will
consult
again
here
and
see
if
mallock
plan
is
a
possible
one
he
strode
towards
the
door
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
it
was
a
dreadful
risk
that
we
ran
in
so
long
delaying
but
there
was
no
gainsaying
james
when
he
had
made
up
his
mind
the
great
antechamber
was
near
full
of
folks
of
all
kinds
when
we
three
came
to
it
again
they
fell
back
as
they
saw
the
duke
and
he
passed
straight
through
as
was
arranged
with
barillon
leaving
me
behind
near
the
door
the
king
bedchamber
was
pretty
dark
and
i
could
see
no
more
of
the
bed
at
the
far
distant
end
than
its
curtains
presently
i
heard
the
duke
in
a
low
voice
saying
something
to
the
company
that
was
within
and
immediately
they
began
to
come
out
three
or
four
bishops
among
them
my
lord
halifax
lord
keeper
north
and
my
lord
craven
i
noticed
that
barillon
was
very
careful
to
let
all
in
the
antechamber
have
a
clear
view
of
the
bed
at
which
by
now
the
duke
was
kneeling
down
having
drawn
back
the
curtains
a
little
yet
not
so
much
as
to
shew
us
the
king
lying
there
round
about
me
they
talked
very
little
though
i
saw
the
bishops
whispering
together
the
two
brothers
spoke
together
very
low
for
ten
minutes
or
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
i
could
hear
the
murmur
of
the
duke
voice
of
his
majesty
i
heard
nothing
except
that
twice
he
said
very
clear
yes
yes
with
all
my
heart
and
i
thanked
god
when
i
heard
that
yet
even
so
all
was
not
yet
done
so
soon
as
i
saw
the
duke
stand
up
again
from
his
kneeling
and
coming
down
the
chamber
i
slipped
away
to
the
door
that
leads
out
towards
her
majesty
apartments
that
i
might
be
ready
for
him
i
saw
him
come
through
all
the
people
standing
and
bowing
to
him
and
barillon
following
him
and
i
noticed
in
particular
a
young
gentleman
whose
name
i
did
not
know
at
that
time
it
was
the
comte
de
castelmelhor
a
very
good
catholic
standing
out
a
little
by
himself
i
noticed
this
man
because
i
saw
that
the
duke
looked
at
him
as
he
came
and
presently
signed
to
him
very
slightly
with
his
head
to
follow
so
all
four
of
us
passed
through
the
door
into
the
long
gallery
that
unites
their
majesties
apartments
and
found
ourselves
alone
in
it
the
count
was
a
little
behind
he
has
consented
said
the
duke
in
a
low
voice
to
my
bringing
him
a
priest
we
must
send
for
one
but
i
dare
not
bring
one
of
the
duchess
they
are
too
sir
said
monsieur
barillon
i
will
do
so
with
pleasure
why
not
one
of
her
majesty
priests
the
duke
nodded
we
three
were
all
standing
together
about
the
middle
of
the
gallery
the
comte
de
castelmelhor
was
halted
uncovered
a
little
behind
us
the
duke
turned
to
him
count
said
he
speaking
in
french
we
are
on
a
very
urgent
business
his
majesty
hath
consented
that
a
priest
should
come
to
him
will
you
go
for
us
to
the
queen
and
ask
for
one
of
her
chaplains
the
young
man
flushed
up
with
pleasure
with
all
my
heart
sir
he
said
which
priest
shall
i
ask
for
is
there
one
that
can
speak
english
the
duke
struck
his
forehead
with
his
open
hand
lord
he
said
i
never
thought
of
that
we
must
have
an
englishman
where
shall
we
send
sir
said
the
ambassador
there
is
one
at
least
at
the
venetian
resident
again
i
broke
in
my
impatience
drove
me
near
mad
time
was
passing
quickly
i
could
have
fetched
a
priest
myself
ten
times
over
if
the
duke
had
but
allowed
me
to
go
in
the
beginning
sir
said
i
for
god
sake
let
me
go
first
to
her
apartments
i
be
bound
there
one
at
least
there
that
knows
english
let
this
gentleman
come
with
me
the
duke
stared
at
me
as
if
bewildered
i
think
he
saw
that
he
had
done
little
but
hinder
the
business
so
far
go
he
said
suddenly
go
both
of
you
together
stay
bring
a
priest
with
you
if
you
can
find
one
to
the
little
room
behind
the
king
bed
but
bring
him
up
the
stairs
the
other
way
bid
him
stay
till
i
send
chiffinch
to
him
then
we
were
gone
at
full
speed
chapter
xi
it
was
eight
at
night
and
the
priest
and
i
were
still
waiting
in
the
little
room
and
no
word
was
come
through
from
the
bedchamber
beyond
that
chiffinch
had
come
through
once
to
bid
us
be
ready
once
again
god
had
favoured
us
in
spite
of
all
our
blunders
the
count
and
i
had
run
together
through
to
her
majesty
lodging
and
there
we
had
found
as
i
knew
we
should
a
priest
that
knew
english
but
i
had
not
thought
that
god
hand
should
be
so
visible
in
the
matter
as
that
we
should
find
none
other
but
huddleston
himself
the
scotsman
that
had
saved
the
king
life
after
the
battle
of
worcester
there
was
a
very
particular
seemliness
in
this
though
i
had
not
much
time
to
think
of
it
then
but
our
difficulties
were
not
all
over
first
huddleston
declared
that
he
had
never
reconciled
a
convert
in
his
life
and
did
not
know
how
to
set
about
it
next
he
said
that
he
was
the
worst
man
in
the
world
to
do
it
as
his
face
was
very
well
known
and
that
he
would
surely
be
suspected
if
he
were
seen
and
third
that
the
most
holy
sacrament
was
not
in
whitehall
at
all
and
that
therefore
he
could
not
give
he
looked
very
agitated
in
spite
of
his
ruddy
face
i
was
amazed
at
the
man
but
i
forced
myself
to
treat
him
with
patience
for
he
was
the
only
priest
we
could
get
first
i
told
him
that
nothing
was
needed
but
to
hear
the
confession
give
him
absolution
and
anoint
him
next
that
we
would
disguise
him
in
a
great
periwig
and
a
gown
such
as
the
protestant
divines
wore
for
as
i
spoke
i
actually
spied
such
a
gown
hanging
on
the
wall
of
the
chamber
in
which
i
was
speaking
with
him
third
that
another
priest
could
go
to
james
and
bring
the
most
holy
sacrament
to
him
from
there
at
that
point
father
bento
de
lemoz
who
was
listening
to
our
talk
came
forward
and
interposed
he
would
get
a
little
ritual
directly
he
said
in
very
poor
english
that
had
in
it
all
that
was
necessary
and
he
would
go
himself
not
to
james
for
that
was
too
far
off
but
to
somerset
house
and
get
the
holy
sacrament
from
the
royal
chapel
there
huddleston
had
nothing
to
say
to
that
and
in
five
minutes
we
had
him
in
his
periwig
and
gown
with
the
book
in
his
pocket
with
the
holy
oils
and
away
downstairs
and
along
the
passage
beneath
and
up
again
by
the
little
winding
stair
into
the
chamber
beyond
the
king
bed
i
gave
him
no
time
to
think
of
any
more
objections
that
was
a
very
strange
vigil
that
we
held
for
very
near
i
should
think
twenty
minutes
or
half
an
hour
we
both
sat
there
together
without
speaking
for
the
most
of
the
time
huddleston
was
reading
in
his
ritual
and
i
could
see
his
brow
furrowed
and
his
lips
moving
as
be
conned
over
all
that
he
would
have
to
do
and
say
to
his
majesty
he
was
a
man
as
he
had
said
completely
unaccustomed
to
such
ministrations
though
he
was
a
very
good
man
and
a
good
priest
too
in
other
matters
after
a
while
he
laid
aside
his
book
and
prayed
i
think
for
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
a
minute
or
two
later
i
could
bear
the
delay
no
longer
i
rose
and
went
up
the
three
or
four
steps
that
led
to
the
king
bedchamber
and
listened
there
was
a
low
murmur
of
voices
within
so
that
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
room
was
not
yet
cleared
i
put
my
hand
upon
the
door
and
pushed
it
a
little
and
to
my
satisfaction
it
was
not
latched
but
opened
an
inch
or
two
but
someone
was
standing
immediately
on
the
other
side
of
it
i
stepped
back
and
the
door
opened
again
just
enough
for
me
to
see
the
face
of
chiffinch
he
looked
past
me
quickly
to
see
that
the
priest
was
there
i
suppose
and
then
nodded
at
me
two
or
three
times
then
he
pushed
the
door
almost
to
again
a
moment
after
i
heard
the
duke
voice
within
a
little
unsteady
but
very
clear
and
distinct
he
was
standing
up
i
think
on
the
far
side
of
the
bed
gentlemen
he
said
the
king
wishes
all
to
retire
excepting
the
earls
of
bath
and
feversham
bath
and
feversham
thought
i
why
those
two
in
god
name
that
were
such
a
pair
of
protestants
but
indeed
it
was
the
one
good
stroke
that
the
duke
made
for
the
names
reassured
as
i
heard
afterwards
all
that
had
any
suspicions
and
even
the
bishops
themselves
there
was
a
rustle
of
footsteps
very
plain
that
followed
the
words
i
turned
to
the
room
behind
me
again
and
saw
that
huddleston
too
had
heard
what
had
passed
he
was
standing
up
very
pale
and
agitated
with
the
book
clasped
in
his
hands
i
moved
down
the
steps
again
so
as
not
to
block
the
way
and
again
there
followed
a
silence
in
the
midst
of
which
i
heard
a
door
latched
somewhere
in
the
bedchamber
then
suddenly
the
door
opened
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
the
duke
stood
there
he
too
as
pale
as
death
he
nodded
once
very
emphatically
and
disappeared
again
then
the
priest
went
by
me
without
a
word
up
the
steps
and
so
through
the
door
as
before
remained
a
crack
open
i
went
up
to
it
and
put
my
eye
to
the
crack
on
the
left
was
the
end
of
the
bed
with
the
curtains
drawn
across
it
and
beyond
the
bed
i
could
see
the
whole
room
down
to
the
end
for
the
candles
were
burning
everywhere
as
well
as
the
fire
i
could
see
the
great
table
before
the
hearth
the
physician
instruments
and
bottles
and
upon
it
the
chairs
about
it
the
tall
furniture
against
the
walls
and
at
least
half
a
dozen
clocks
whose
ticking
was
very
plain
in
the
silence
three
figures
only
were
visible
there
that
nearest
standing
very
rigid
by
the
table
was
chiffinch
of
the
two
beyond
i
could
recognize
only
my
lord
bath
whose
face
looked
this
way
the
other
i
supposed
to
be
my
lord
feversham
the
duke
was
not
within
sight
he
was
kneeling
i
suppose
out
of
my
sight
beyond
the
bed
then
i
heard
his
majesty
voice
very
plain
though
very
weak
and
slow
ah
said
he
you
that
saved
my
body
is
now
come
to
save
my
soul
there
was
the
murmur
of
the
priest
voice
in
answer
the
two
of
them
were
not
more
than
three
or
four
yards
away
from
me
at
the
most
then
again
i
heard
the
king
very
clear
and
continuous
though
still
weak
and
not
so
loud
as
he
had
first
spoken
yes
said
he
i
desire
to
die
in
the
faith
and
communion
of
the
holy
roman
catholic
church
i
am
sorry
with
all
my
heart
that
i
have
deferred
it
for
so
long
and
for
all
my
sins
he
said
it
quite
distinctly
as
if
he
had
rehearsed
it
beforehand
then
the
priest
and
he
spoke
together
the
king
repeating
the
words
sometimes
and
sometimes
volunteering
word
or
two
of
his
own
he
said
that
through
christ
passion
he
hoped
to
be
saved
that
he
was
in
charity
with
all
the
world
that
he
pardoned
his
enemies
most
heartily
and
desired
pardon
of
all
whom
he
had
offended
that
if
god
would
yet
spare
him
he
would
amend
his
life
in
every
particular
all
that
i
heard
with
my
own
ears
and
with
inexpressible
comfort
his
majesty
voice
was
low
but
very
distinct
though
sometimes
he
spoke
scarce
above
a
whisper
and
i
do
not
think
that
any
man
who
heard
him
could
doubt
his
sincerity
however
late
it
was
to
shew
it
but
he
was
not
altogether
too
late
thank
god
so
soon
as
his
majesty
began
his
confession
after
moving
him
to
it
i
slipped
away
from
the
door
and
began
as
softly
as
i
could
to
walk
up
and
down
the
little
chamber
again
i
was
satisfied
beyond
measure
yet
it
seemed
to
me
sometimes
near
incredible
that
i
should
in
very
truth
be
here
at
such
a
time
and
that
i
should
have
been
under
god
merciful
providence
the
instrument
in
such
an
affair
my
life
was
ended
i
knew
well
enough
now
in
all
matters
that
the
world
counts
life
to
consist
of
yet
was
there
ever
such
an
ending
i
had
seen
all
else
go
from
me
my
natural
activities
of
every
kind
my
ambitions
even
the
most
sacred
thing
that
the
world
can
give
after
the
love
of
god
and
that
is
the
love
of
a
woman
yet
the
one
purely
supernatural
end
that
i
had
set
before
me
that
end
to
which
four
days
ago
i
had
said
as
i
thought
for
ever
in
the
duchess
of
gallery
this
was
the
one
single
thing
that
was
mine
after
all
i
could
take
that
at
least
with
me
into
the
cloister
and
could
praise
god
for
it
all
my
life
long
i
mean
the
conversion
of
the
man
that
was
called
king
of
england
the
man
who
for
all
his
sins
and
his
treatment
of
me
i
yet
loved
as
i
have
never
loved
any
other
man
on
earth
i
think
that
in
those
minutes
of
sorrow
and
joy
as
i
paced
up
and
down
the
little
room
my
dearest
dolly
was
not
very
far
away
from
me
and
that
she
knew
all
that
i
felt
once
in
a
loud
broken
voice
through
the
door
i
heard
these
words
sweet
jesus
amen
mercy
sweet
jesus
mercy
that
was
the
king
voice
that
i
heard
and
i
kneeled
down
when
i
heard
them
it
would
be
about
ten
minutes
later
as
i
still
kneeled
that
i
heard
upon
the
outside
of
the
door
that
led
down
the
winding
stairs
a
very
small
tapping
i
ran
to
the
door
to
open
it
wondering
who
it
could
be
for
i
had
forgotten
all
about
the
portuguese
priest
though
i
had
set
the
candles
ready
burning
with
a
napkin
on
the
table
between
them
in
readiness
for
his
coming
and
there
he
stood
with
his
eyes
cast
down
and
his
hands
clasped
upon
his
breast
i
beckoned
him
forward
pointing
to
the
table
and
kneeled
down
again
he
went
past
me
without
a
word
kneeled
himself
before
the
table
and
then
unbuttoning
his
cloak
he
drew
from
round
his
neck
the
chain
and
the
pyx
from
his
breast
and
laid
it
all
upon
the
table
continuing
himself
to
kneel
presently
he
turned
and
looked
at
me
lifting
his
brows
i
knew
what
he
wished
rose
from
my
knees
and
went
up
the
stairs
but
very
cautiously
lest
i
should
hear
anything
that
i
should
not
there
was
but
a
very
faint
murmur
of
the
priest
voice
so
i
took
courage
and
pushed
the
door
a
little
open
so
that
i
could
see
the
king
it
was
very
dark
within
the
curtains
for
they
were
drawn
against
the
candlelight
but
i
could
see
what
was
passing
his
majesty
was
lying
flat
upon
his
back
with
his
hands
clasped
beneath
his
chin
and
huddleston
was
in
the
very
act
of
arranging
the
coverlet
over
him
again
after
the
last
anointing
as
i
looked
the
priest
turned
and
caught
my
eyes
as
he
put
the
and
the
wool
away
again
in
his
cassock
breast
i
nodded
three
times
very
emphatically
his
majesty
did
not
see
me
at
all
for
his
eyes
were
closed
and
went
back
again
down
the
stairs
and
kneeled
once
more
a
few
moments
later
huddleston
came
through
i
have
never
seen
so
swift
a
change
in
any
man
face
he
had
been
terrified
as
he
had
gone
in
all
pale
and
shaking
now
he
was
still
pale
but
his
eyes
shone
and
there
was
a
look
of
great
assurance
in
his
face
he
came
straight
down
the
steps
without
speaking
kneeled
rose
again
took
up
the
pyx
and
the
corporal
which
father
de
lemoz
had
spread
beneath
it
and
passed
up
and
out
again
his
priesthood
i
suppose
had
risen
in
him
like
a
great
tide
and
driven
out
all
other
emotions
again
i
followed
him
to
the
door
and
kneeled
there
where
i
could
see
and
then
there
followed
such
a
scene
as
i
had
never
dreamed
of
the
curtains
on
the
other
side
of
the
bed
had
been
drawn
back
just
enough
to
admit
the
face
of
the
duke
who
now
kneeled
there
yet
not
so
much
that
any
of
the
three
others
at
the
further
end
of
the
chamber
could
see
into
the
bed
the
candlelight
streamed
in
through
the
opening
above
the
duke
head
and
in
it
i
saw
his
majesty
all
weak
as
he
was
striving
to
rise
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
that
which
the
priest
was
holding
in
his
right
hand
i
saw
the
priest
left
hand
go
out
to
restrain
him
but
i
heard
the
king
voice
distinctly
father
he
said
very
brokenly
let
me
receive
my
heavenly
saviour
in
a
better
posture
than
lying
on
my
bed
sir
said
huddleston
with
great
firmness
lie
down
again
if
you
please
god
almighty
who
sees
your
heart
will
accept
your
good
intention
but
neither
of
them
spoke
loud
enough
to
be
heard
at
the
further
end
of
the
great
chamber
and
so
he
was
persuaded
to
lie
down
again
then
the
priest
repeated
again
still
holding
the
blessed
sacrament
before
the
king
eyes
the
act
of
contrition
of
which
i
had
heard
a
word
or
two
a
while
ago
and
his
majesty
repeated
it
after
him
word
for
word
very
devoutly
then
as
the
time
was
short
huddleston
omitted
several
of
the
proper
prayers
and
proceeded
at
once
to
the
communion
saying
but
the
three
times
and
then
communicating
him
immediately
with
my
own
eyes
i
saw
that
holy
act
which
sealed
all
and
admitted
the
dying
man
to
sacramental
union
with
his
god
his
eyes
were
closed
throughout
and
when
it
was
done
he
lay
as
still
as
a
stone
his
poor
wasted
face
all
dark
against
the
white
pillows
i
caught
a
glimpse
too
of
the
duke
his
face
was
bowed
in
his
hands
and
he
was
weeping
so
that
his
shoulders
shook
with
it
presently
the
priest
was
reading
again
as
well
as
he
could
in
a
very
low
whisper
the
prayers
for
the
recommendation
of
a
departing
soul
down
to
the
very
end
his
majesty
lay
motionless
throughout
at
the
end
he
opened
his
eyes
father
he
whispered
the
act
of
contrition
once
more
if
you
please
i
have
sinned
i
have
sinned
very
he
could
speak
no
more
for
weeping
then
once
more
very
slowly
and
tenderly
the
priest
repeated
it
down
to
sweet
jesus
mercy
my
own
eyes
were
all
dim
with
tears
and
as
fast
as
i
brushed
them
away
they
came
again
when
at
last
i
could
see
plainly
once
more
the
priest
was
holding
up
a
little
crucifix
before
the
king
eyes
and
he
made
him
a
short
address
very
christian
and
forcible
i
remember
near
every
word
of
it
as
he
said
it
lift
up
the
eyes
of
your
soul
sir
he
said
and
represent
to
yourself
your
sweet
saviour
here
crucified
bowing
down
his
head
to
kiss
you
his
arms
stretched
out
to
embrace
you
his
body
and
members
all
bloody
and
pale
with
death
to
redeem
you
beseech
him
sir
with
all
humility
that
his
most
precious
blood
may
not
be
shed
in
vain
for
you
and
that
it
will
please
him
by
the
merits
of
his
bitter
death
and
passion
to
pardon
and
forgive
you
all
your
offences
and
finally
to
receive
your
soul
into
his
blessed
hands
and
when
it
shall
please
him
to
take
it
out
of
this
transitory
world
to
grant
you
a
joyful
resurrection
and
an
eternal
crown
of
glory
in
the
next
he
bent
lower
making
a
great
sign
of
the
cross
with
his
right
hand
and
the
king
too
tried
to
bless
himself
in
response
in
the
name
said
he
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
ghost
amen
one
more
joy
and
sorrow
all
in
one
was
yet
to
be
mine
before
the
end
as
i
opened
the
door
for
the
priest
to
come
back
his
majesty
lifted
his
eyes
and
saw
me
there
and
i
perceived
that
he
recognized
me
the
duke
had
already
risen
up
and
gone
down
the
room
to
bid
them
i
suppose
to
open
the
door
and
let
the
folks
in
again
then
as
the
king
eyes
met
my
own
he
made
a
sign
with
his
head
that
i
should
come
near
i
think
that
if
the
chamber
had
been
filled
with
but
one
mob
of
and
protestants
i
should
have
obeyed
him
then
even
though
i
should
have
been
torn
to
pieces
the
next
instant
i
went
forward
without
a
word
leaving
the
door
open
behind
me
and
flung
myself
on
my
knees
at
the
bedside
his
majesty
was
too
weary
to
speak
but
as
i
kneeled
there
with
my
face
in
my
hands
on
the
bedclothes
and
my
tears
raining
down
he
lifted
his
right
hand
and
put
it
on
my
head
leaving
it
there
for
an
instant
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
thank
me
and
i
value
that
blessing
from
him
a
penitent
sinner
as
he
was
with
the
body
of
our
saviour
still
in
his
breast
as
much
as
any
blessing
i
have
ever
had
from
any
man
priest
or
bishop
or
pope
as
he
lifted
his
hand
off
again
i
caught
at
it
and
kissed
it
three
or
four
times
careless
whether
or
no
my
tears
poured
down
upon
it
as
i
passed
back
again
through
the
door
to
where
huddleston
was
waiting
for
me
i
heard
the
doors
at
the
further
end
of
the
chamber
unlatched
and
the
footsteps
of
the
folks
physicians
courtiers
bishops
and
the
rest
that
poured
in
to
see
the
end
epilogue
i
have
said
again
and
again
how
strange
this
or
that
moment
or
incident
appeared
to
me
as
i
experienced
it
yet
as
i
sit
here
now
in
my
cell
thirty
years
later
looking
out
upon
the
with
its
twisted
columns
and
the
cypresses
and
the
grass
it
is
not
so
much
this
or
that
thing
that
appears
to
me
strange
but
the
whole
of
my
experiences
and
indeed
human
life
altogether
for
what
can
be
more
extraordinary
than
a
life
which
began
as
mine
did
when
i
first
went
to
england
in
sixteen
hundred
and
should
be
ending
as
mine
will
end
presently
if
god
will
as
a
monk
of
in
holy
rome
to
what
purpose
i
ask
myself
was
that
part
of
my
life
designed
by
divine
providence
for
what
did
i
labour
so
long
when
all
was
to
come
to
nothing
for
what
was
i
to
learn
the
passion
of
human
love
if
but
to
lose
it
again
for
what
was
i
to
intrigue
and
spy
and
labour
and
adventure
my
life
for
the
cause
of
england
and
the
catholic
church
when
all
a
year
or
two
later
was
to
fall
back
and
further
than
it
had
ever
fallen
before
into
the
darkness
of
heresy
there
is
but
one
effort
in
all
those
years
of
which
i
saw
the
fruition
and
that
was
the
conversion
of
my
master
upon
his
deathbed
however
i
have
not
yet
related
what
passed
after
i
had
gone
from
the
king
again
and
took
huddleston
downstairs
i
will
relate
that
very
shortly
and
make
an
end
i
had
it
all
from
chiffinch
before
i
left
london
his
majesty
after
we
were
gone
from
him
rallied
a
little
in
so
far
as
to
make
some
think
that
he
would
recover
altogether
but
the
physicians
said
no
and
they
were
right
for
near
the
first
time
in
all
their
diagnosis
of
his
state
but
they
continued
to
give
him
their
remedies
of
sal
ammoniac
and
peruvian
bark
and
later
the
oriental
bezoar
stone
which
is
a
pebble
i
understand
taken
from
the
stomach
of
a
goat
also
they
blooded
him
again
twelve
ounces
more
and
all
to
no
purpose
his
majesty
said
a
number
of
things
that
night
that
were
very
characteristic
of
him
for
god
gave
him
back
his
gift
of
merriment
now
that
he
had
the
gift
of
faith
as
well
and
he
shewed
a
great
tenderness
too
from
time
to
time
and
a
very
christian
appreciation
of
his
own
condition
for
example
he
said
that
he
was
suffering
very
much
but
he
thanked
god
for
it
and
that
he
was
able
to
bear
it
with
patience
as
indeed
he
did
two
or
three
times
however
he
seemed
to
sigh
for
death
to
come
quickly
and
once
he
looked
round
with
his
old
laughter
at
the
solemn
faces
round
his
bed
and
begged
their
pardon
that
he
was
such
an
unconscionable
time
in
dying
my
work
in
this
world
seems
over
he
said
such
as
it
has
been
i
pray
god
i
may
be
at
a
better
occupation
presently
he
thanked
his
royal
highness
the
duke
of
york
who
was
by
his
bed
all
that
night
weeping
and
kissing
his
hand
repeatedly
for
all
his
attention
and
love
for
him
and
asked
his
pardon
for
any
hardship
that
had
been
done
to
his
brother
through
his
fault
he
gave
him
his
clothes
and
his
keys
telling
him
that
all
was
now
his
and
that
he
prayed
god
to
give
him
a
prosperous
reign
to
her
majesty
who
came
to
see
him
again
about
midnight
he
shewed
the
tenderest
consideration
and
love
but
the
queen
who
swooned
again
and
again
at
the
sight
of
him
and
had
to
be
carried
back
to
her
apartments
sent
him
a
message
later
begging
his
pardon
for
any
offence
that
she
had
ever
done
to
him
what
whispered
the
king
what
she
beg
my
pardon
poor
woman
rather
i
beg
hers
with
all
my
heart
carry
that
message
back
to
her
majesty
no
less
than
twice
did
the
king
commend
the
duchess
of
portsmouth
to
the
duke
care
poor
fubbs
as
he
had
called
her
to
me
some
blamed
him
for
thinking
of
her
at
all
at
such
a
time
as
also
for
bidding
his
brother
not
to
let
poor
nell
starve
but
for
myself
i
can
not
understand
such
blame
at
all
if
ever
there
were
two
poor
souls
who
needed
care
and
forgiveness
it
was
those
two
women
nell
and
her
grace
all
his
natural
sons
were
there
all
except
the
duke
of
monmouth
whose
name
never
passed
his
lips
from
the
beginning
of
his
sickness
to
the
end
and
these
too
he
recommended
to
his
brother
the
three
sons
of
the
duchess
of
cleveland
and
the
rest
i
do
not
wonder
that
he
left
out
his
grace
of
monmouth
it
seems
to
me
very
near
prophetical
of
what
was
to
fall
presently
when
the
duke
was
to
revolt
against
his
new
sovereign
and
suffer
the
last
penalty
for
it
at
his
hands
but
his
majesty
blessed
all
the
rest
of
his
children
one
by
one
drawing
them
down
to
him
upon
the
bed
they
weeping
aloud
as
i
heard
a
very
strange
scene
followed
this
one
of
the
bishops
fell
down
upon
his
knees
and
begged
him
who
was
the
lord
anointed
and
anointed
too
lately
in
a
fashion
the
bishop
never
dreamed
of
to
bless
all
that
were
there
since
they
were
all
his
children
and
all
his
subjects
too
the
bedchamber
was
now
full
from
end
to
end
and
all
the
company
fell
together
upon
their
knees
his
majesty
raising
himself
in
bed
first
begged
the
pardon
of
all
in
a
loud
voice
for
anything
in
which
he
had
acted
contrary
to
the
interests
of
his
country
or
the
principles
of
good
government
and
then
still
in
a
loud
voice
pronounced
a
blessing
on
them
all
then
he
fell
back
again
upon
his
pillows
so
that
night
went
slowly
by
the
dogs
were
still
in
the
room
whining
from
time
to
time
as
chiffinch
told
me
afterwards
for
it
was
thought
better
that
i
myself
as
one
so
deeply
involved
in
what
had
lately
passed
should
not
be
present
and
one
of
the
little
dogs
sought
repeatedly
to
leap
upon
the
bed
but
was
prevented
and
at
last
was
carried
away
crying
again
and
again
first
one
bishop
and
then
another
begged
him
to
receive
the
sacrament
but
he
would
not
so
they
prayed
by
him
instead
which
was
all
they
could
do
at
about
six
when
dawn
came
he
begged
that
the
curtains
of
his
bed
might
be
drawn
back
yet
further
and
the
windows
opened
that
he
might
see
daylight
again
and
breathe
the
fresh
air
and
this
was
done
then
at
the
chiming
of
the
hour
by
the
clocks
in
the
room
he
remembered
that
one
of
them
which
was
an
one
should
be
wound
up
for
it
was
a
friday
on
which
it
was
always
wound
and
this
too
was
done
at
seven
breathlessness
came
on
him
again
and
he
was
compelled
to
sit
up
in
bed
with
his
brother
arm
about
him
on
one
side
and
a
physician
upon
the
other
they
blooded
him
again
to
twelve
ounces
more
which
i
suppose
took
his
last
remnant
of
strength
from
him
for
in
spite
of
their
remedies
he
sank
very
rapidly
and
about
eight
lost
all
power
of
speech
he
kept
his
consciousness
however
moving
his
eyes
and
shewing
that
he
understood
what
was
said
to
him
till
ten
and
then
he
became
unconscious
altogether
at
a
little
before
noon
without
a
struggle
or
agony
of
any
kind
his
sacred
majesty
ceased
to
breathe
of
all
that
followed
there
is
no
need
that
i
should
write
for
i
remained
in
england
only
till
after
the
funeral
in
westminster
abbey
which
was
very
poorly
done
eight
days
later
and
i
left
on
the
sunday
morning
for
dover
after
being
present
first
for
a
remembrance
at
the
first
mass
celebrated
publicly
in
england
with
open
doors
in
the
presence
of
the
sovereign
since
over
a
hundred
and
thirty
years
i
had
audience
with
king
james
on
the
night
before
when
i
went
to
take
my
leave
of
him
and
he
renewed
to
me
the
offer
of
the
viscounty
of
which
i
think
chiffinch
had
spoken
to
him
but
i
refused
it
as
courteously
as
i
could
telling
him
that
i
was
for
rome
and
the
cloister
all
the
rest
however
is
known
by
others
better
than
by
myself
and
the
events
that
followed
his
majesty
shewed
himself
as
he
had
always
been
courageous
obstinate
and
entirely
without
understanding
he
was
profuse
in
his
promises
of
religious
equality
but
slow
to
observe
them
he
shewed
ruthlessness
where
he
should
have
shewn
tenderness
and
tenderness
where
he
should
have
shewn
ruthlessness
so
once
more
all
our
labours
went
for
nothing
and
william
came
in
and
the
catholic
cause
vanished
clean
out
of
england
until
it
shall
please
god
to
bring
it
back
again
so
here
i
sit
near
sixty
years
old
a
monk
of
the
order
of
saint
benet
in
my
cell
at
i
have
been
novice
master
three
times
but
i
shall
never
be
more
than
that
for
governmental
affairs
and
i
have
said
farewell
to
one
another
a
long
while
ago
it
was
through
my
telling
of
my
adventures
to
my
novices
at
that
the
writing
of
them
down
came
about
for
my
lord
abbot
heard
of
them
and
put
me
under
obedience
to
write
them
down
he
did
this
when
he
heard
one
of
my
novices
name
me
to
another
as
father
viscount
i
have
written
them
then
down
all
in
full
leaving
nothing
out
except
the
french
affairs
on
which
i
was
put
under
oath
by
his
majesty
never
to
reveal
anything
i
have
left
out
not
even
the
tale
of
my
cousin
dolly
for
i
hold
that
in
such
a
love
as
was
ours
there
is
nothing
that
a
monk
need
be
ashamed
of
i
will
venture
even
further
than
that
and
will
say
that
i
am
a
better
monk
than
i
should
have
been
without
it
and
as
one
last
piece
of
rashness
i
will
say
that
amongst
those
good
things
which
god
hath
prepared
for
them
that
love
him
in
that
world
which
is
beyond
this
if
i
ever
come
at
it
by
his
grace
will
be
i
think
the
look
on
my
cousin
dolly
face
when
i
see
her
again
of
other
personages
whose
acquaintance
i
made
in
england
excepting
always
his
majesty
and
my
master
charles
the
second
i
neither
speak
nor
think
very
much
now
my
cousin
tom
died
of
an
apoplexy
three
years
after
i
left
england
and
god
knows
who
hath
hare
street
house
his
majesty
james
the
second
as
all
the
world
knows
made
a
most
excellent
end
of
it
in
france
dying
as
he
had
never
lived
till
after
his
coming
to
france
a
very
humble
and
christian
soul
in
regard
to
chiffinch
i
think
of
him
sometimes
and
wonder
what
kind
of
an
end
he
made
he
was
very
reprobate
while
i
knew
him
yet
he
had
the
gift
of
fidelity
and
that
i
think
must
count
for
something
before
god
who
gave
it
him
of
the
ladies
of
the
court
i
know
nothing
at
all
nor
how
they
fared
nor
how
they
ended
nor
even
if
they
are
all
dead
yet
i
mean
such
ladies
as
was
her
grace
of
portsmouth
but
all
of
them
i
commend
to
god
every
day
in
my
mass
living
or
dead
and
trust
that
all
may
have
found
the
mercy
of
god
or
may
yet
find
it
but
most
of
all
i
remember
at
the
altar
the
names
of
two
persons
than
between
whom
there
could
be
no
greater
difference
in
this
world
the
names
of
dorothy
mary
jermyn
the
least
of
all
sinners
and
of
charles
stuart
king
of
england
the
greatest
of
all
sinners
yet
a
penitent
one
for
these
are
the
two
whom
i
have
loved
as
i
can
never
love
any
others
