the

chapter
i
the
smuggled
supper
outside
the
bedroom
the
night
was
black
and
still
the
small
rain
fell
too
softly
to
be
heard
in
the
garden
not
a
leaf
stirred
in
the
airless
calm
the
was
asleep
the
cats
were
indoors
far
or
near
under
the
murky
heaven
not
a
sound
was
stirring
inside
the
bedroom
the
night
was
black
and
still
miss
ladd
knew
her
business
as
a
schoolmistress
too
well
to
allow
and
miss
ladd
s
young
ladies
were
supposed
to
be
fast
asleep
in
accordance
with
the
rules
of
the
house
only
at
intervals
the
silence
was
faintly
disturbed
when
the
restless
turning
of
one
of
the
girls
in
her
bed
betrayed
itself
by
a
gentle
rustling
between
the
sheets
in
the
long
intervals
of
stillness
not
even
the
softly
audible
breathing
of
young
creatures
asleep
was
to
be
heard
the
first
sound
that
told
of
life
and
movement
revealed
the
mechanical
movement
of
the
clock
speaking
from
the
lower
regions
the
tongue
of
father
time
told
the
hour
before
midnight
a
soft
voice
rose
wearily
near
the
door
of
the
room
it
counted
the
strokes
of
the
clock
and
reminded
one
of
the
girls
of
the
lapse
of
time
emily
eleven
o
there
was
no
reply
after
an
interval
the
weary
voice
tried
again
in
louder
tones
emily
a
girl
whose
bed
was
at
the
inner
end
of
the
room
sighed
under
the
heavy
heat
of
the
night
and
said
in
peremptory
tones
is
that
cecilia
what
do
you
want
i
m
getting
hungry
emily
is
the
new
girl
asleep
the
new
girl
answered
promptly
and
spitefully
no
she
isn
having
a
private
object
of
their
own
in
view
the
five
wise
virgins
of
miss
ladd
s
first
class
had
waited
an
hour
in
wakeful
anticipation
of
the
falling
asleep
of
the
stranger
and
it
had
ended
in
this
way
a
ripple
of
laughter
ran
round
the
room
the
new
girl
mortified
and
offended
entered
her
protest
in
plain
words
you
are
treating
me
shamefully
you
all
distrust
me
because
i
am
a
say
we
don
t
understand
you
emily
answered
speaking
for
her
schoolfellows
and
you
will
be
nearer
the
who
expected
you
to
understand
me
when
i
only
came
here
i
have
told
you
already
my
name
is
francine
de
sor
if
want
to
know
more
i
m
nineteen
years
old
and
i
come
from
the
west
emily
still
took
the
lead
why
do
you
come
she
asked
who
ever
heard
of
a
girl
joining
a
new
school
just
before
the
holidays
you
are
nineteen
years
old
are
you
i
m
a
year
younger
than
you
and
i
have
finished
my
education
the
next
big
girl
in
the
room
is
a
year
younger
than
me
and
she
has
finished
her
education
what
can
you
possibly
have
left
to
learn
at
your
age
everything
cried
the
stranger
from
the
west
indies
with
an
outburst
of
tears
i
m
a
poor
ignorant
creature
your
education
ought
to
have
taught
you
to
pity
me
instead
of
making
fun
of
me
i
hate
you
all
for
shame
for
shame
some
of
the
girls
laughed
one
of
them
the
hungry
girl
who
had
counted
the
strokes
of
the
clock
took
francine
s
part
never
mind
their
laughing
miss
de
sor
you
are
quite
right
you
have
good
reason
to
complain
of
miss
de
sor
dried
her
eyes
thank
you
whoever
you
are
she
answered
briskly
my
name
is
cecilia
wyvil
the
other
proceeded
it
was
not
perhaps
quite
nice
of
you
to
say
you
hated
us
all
at
the
same
time
we
have
forgotten
our
good
breeding
and
the
least
we
can
do
is
to
beg
your
this
expression
of
generous
sentiment
appeared
to
have
an
irritating
effect
on
the
peremptory
young
person
who
took
the
lead
in
the
room
perhaps
she
disapproved
of
free
trade
in
generous
sentiment
i
can
tell
you
one
thing
cecilia
she
said
you
shan
t
beat
me
in
generosity
strike
a
light
one
of
you
and
lay
the
blame
on
me
if
miss
ladd
finds
us
out
i
mean
to
shake
hands
with
the
new
girl
and
how
can
i
do
it
in
the
dark
miss
de
sor
my
name
s
brown
and
i
m
queen
of
the
bedroom
i
not
cecilia
offer
our
apologies
if
we
have
offended
you
cecilia
is
my
dearest
friend
but
i
don
t
allow
her
to
take
the
lead
in
the
room
oh
what
a
lovely
nightgown
the
sudden
flow
of
had
revealed
francine
sitting
up
in
her
bed
and
displaying
such
treasures
of
real
lace
over
her
bosom
that
the
queen
lost
all
sense
of
royal
dignity
in
irrepressible
admiration
seven
and
sixpence
emily
remarked
looking
at
her
own
and
despising
it
one
after
another
the
girls
yielded
to
the
attraction
of
the
wonderful
lace
slim
and
plump
fair
and
dark
they
circled
round
the
new
pupil
in
their
flowing
white
robes
and
arrived
by
common
consent
at
one
and
the
same
conclusion
how
rich
her
father
must
be
favored
by
fortune
in
the
matter
of
money
was
this
enviable
person
possessed
of
beauty
as
well
in
the
disposition
of
the
beds
miss
de
sor
was
placed
between
cecilia
on
the
right
hand
and
emily
on
the
left
if
by
some
fantastic
turn
of
events
a
man
say
in
the
interests
of
propriety
a
married
doctor
with
miss
ladd
to
look
after
him
had
been
permitted
to
enter
the
room
and
had
been
asked
what
he
thought
of
the
girls
when
he
came
out
he
would
not
even
have
mentioned
francine
blind
to
the
beauties
of
the
expensive
he
would
have
noticed
her
long
upper
lip
her
obstinate
chin
her
sallow
complexion
her
eyes
placed
too
close
together
and
would
have
turned
his
attention
to
her
nearest
neighbors
on
one
side
his
languid
interest
would
have
been
instantly
roused
by
cecilia
s
glowing
auburn
hair
her
exquisitely
pure
skin
and
her
tender
blue
eyes
on
the
other
he
would
have
discovered
a
bright
little
creature
who
would
have
fascinated
and
perplexed
him
at
one
and
the
same
time
if
he
had
been
questioned
about
her
by
a
stranger
he
would
have
been
at
a
loss
to
say
positively
whether
she
was
dark
or
light
he
would
have
remembered
how
her
eyes
had
held
him
but
he
would
not
have
known
of
what
color
they
were
and
yet
she
would
have
remained
a
vivid
picture
in
his
memory
when
other
impressions
derived
at
the
same
time
had
vanished
there
was
one
little
witch
among
them
who
was
worth
all
the
rest
put
together
and
i
can
t
tell
you
why
they
called
her
emily
if
i
wasn
t
a
married
man
there
he
would
have
thought
of
his
wife
and
would
have
sighed
and
said
no
more
while
the
girls
were
still
admiring
francine
the
clock
struck
the
past
eleven
cecilia
stole
on
tiptoe
to
the
door
looked
out
and
listened
closed
the
door
again
and
addressed
the
meeting
with
the
irresistible
charm
of
her
sweet
voice
and
her
persuasive
smile
are
none
of
you
hungry
yet
she
inquired
the
teachers
are
safe
in
their
rooms
we
have
set
ourselves
right
with
francine
why
keep
the
supper
waiting
under
emily
s
bed
such
reasoning
as
this
with
such
personal
attractions
to
recommend
it
admitted
of
but
one
reply
the
queen
waved
her
hand
graciously
and
said
pull
it
is
a
lovely
girl
whose
face
possesses
the
crowning
charm
of
expression
whose
slightest
movement
reveals
the
supple
symmetry
of
her
figure
less
lovely
because
she
is
blessed
with
a
good
appetite
and
is
not
ashamed
to
acknowledge
it
with
a
grace
all
her
own
cecilia
dived
under
the
bed
and
produced
a
basket
of
jam
tarts
a
basket
of
fruit
and
sweetmeats
a
basket
of
sparkling
lemonade
and
a
superb
cake
all
paid
for
by
general
subscriptions
and
smuggled
into
the
room
by
kind
connivance
of
the
servants
on
this
occasion
the
feast
was
especially
plentiful
and
expensive
in
commemoration
not
only
of
the
arrival
of
the
midsummer
holidays
but
of
the
coming
freedom
of
miss
ladd
s
two
leading
young
ladies
with
widely
different
destinies
before
them
emily
and
cecilia
had
completed
their
school
life
and
were
now
to
go
out
into
the
world
the
contrast
in
the
characters
of
the
two
girls
showed
itself
even
in
such
a
trifle
as
the
preparations
for
supper
gentle
cecilia
sitting
on
the
floor
surrounded
by
good
things
left
it
to
the
ingenuity
of
others
to
decide
whether
the
baskets
should
be
all
emptied
at
once
or
handed
round
from
bed
to
bed
one
at
a
time
in
the
meanwhile
her
lovely
blue
eyes
rested
tenderly
on
the
tarts
emily
s
commanding
spirit
seized
on
the
reins
of
government
and
employed
each
of
her
schoolfellows
in
the
occupation
which
she
was
fittest
to
undertake
miss
de
sor
let
me
look
at
your
hand
ah
i
thought
so
you
have
got
the
thickest
wrist
among
us
you
shall
draw
the
corks
if
you
let
the
lemonade
pop
not
a
drop
of
it
goes
down
your
throat
effie
annis
priscilla
you
are
three
notoriously
lazy
girls
it
s
doing
you
a
true
kindness
to
set
you
to
work
effie
clear
the
for
supper
away
with
the
combs
the
brushes
and
the
annis
tear
the
leaves
out
of
your
book
of
exercises
and
set
them
out
for
plates
no
i
ll
unpack
nobody
touches
the
baskets
but
me
priscilla
you
have
the
prettiest
ears
in
the
room
you
shall
act
as
sentinel
my
dear
and
listen
at
the
door
cecilia
when
you
have
done
devouring
those
tarts
with
your
eyes
take
that
pair
of
scissors
miss
de
sor
allow
me
to
apologize
for
the
mean
manner
in
which
this
school
is
carried
on
the
knives
and
forks
are
counted
and
locked
up
every
night
i
say
take
that
pair
of
scissors
cecilia
and
carve
the
cake
and
don
t
keep
the
largest
bit
for
yourself
are
we
all
ready
very
well
now
take
example
by
me
talk
as
much
as
you
like
so
long
as
you
don
t
talk
too
loud
there
is
one
other
thing
before
we
begin
the
men
always
propose
toasts
on
these
occasions
let
s
be
like
the
men
can
any
of
you
make
a
speech
ah
it
falls
on
me
as
usual
i
propose
the
first
toast
down
with
all
schools
and
teachers
especially
the
new
teacher
who
came
this
half
year
oh
mercy
how
it
stings
the
fixed
gas
in
the
lemonade
took
the
orator
at
that
moment
by
the
throat
and
effectually
checked
the
flow
of
her
eloquence
it
made
no
difference
to
the
girls
excepting
the
ease
of
feeble
stomachs
who
cares
for
eloquence
in
the
presence
of
a
there
were
no
feeble
stomachs
in
that
bedroom
with
what
inexhaustible
energy
miss
ladd
s
young
ladies
ate
and
drank
how
merrily
they
enjoyed
the
delightful
privilege
of
talking
nonsense
and
alas
alas
how
vainly
they
tried
in
after
life
to
renew
the
once
unalloyed
enjoyment
of
tarts
and
lemonade
in
the
unintelligible
scheme
of
creation
there
appears
to
be
no
human
happiness
not
even
the
happiness
of
schoolgirls
which
is
ever
complete
just
as
it
was
drawing
to
a
close
the
enjoyment
of
the
feast
was
interrupted
by
an
alarm
from
the
sentinel
at
the
door
put
out
the
candle
priscilla
whispered
somebody
on
the
chapter
ii
biography
in
the
bedroom
the
candle
was
instantly
extinguished
in
discreet
silence
the
girls
stole
back
to
their
beds
and
listened
as
an
aid
to
the
vigilance
of
the
sentinel
the
door
had
been
left
ajar
through
the
narrow
opening
a
creaking
of
the
broad
wooden
stairs
of
the
old
house
became
audible
in
another
moment
there
was
silence
an
interval
passed
and
the
creaking
was
heard
again
this
time
the
sound
was
distant
and
diminishing
on
a
sudden
it
stopped
the
midnight
silence
was
disturbed
no
more
what
did
this
mean
had
one
among
the
many
persons
in
authority
under
miss
ladd
s
roof
heard
the
girls
talking
and
ascended
the
stairs
to
surprise
them
in
the
act
of
violating
one
of
the
rules
of
the
house
so
far
such
a
proceeding
was
by
no
means
uncommon
but
was
it
within
the
limits
of
probability
that
a
teacher
should
alter
her
opinion
of
her
own
duty
up
the
stairs
and
deliberately
go
back
to
her
own
room
again
the
bare
idea
of
such
a
thing
was
absurd
on
the
face
of
it
what
more
rational
explanation
could
ingenuity
discover
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
francine
was
the
first
to
offer
a
suggestion
she
shook
and
shivered
in
her
bed
and
said
for
heaven
s
sake
light
the
candle
again
it
s
a
clear
away
the
supper
you
fools
before
the
ghost
can
report
us
to
miss
with
this
excellent
advice
emily
checked
the
rising
panic
the
door
was
closed
the
candle
was
lit
all
traces
of
the
supper
disappeared
for
five
minutes
more
they
listened
again
no
sound
came
from
the
stairs
no
teacher
or
ghost
of
a
teacher
appeared
at
the
door
having
eaten
her
supper
cecilia
s
immediate
anxieties
were
at
an
end
she
was
at
leisure
to
exert
her
intelligence
for
the
benefit
of
her
schoolfellows
in
her
gentle
ingratiating
way
she
offered
a
composing
suggestion
when
we
heard
the
creaking
i
don
t
believe
there
was
anybody
on
the
stairs
in
these
old
houses
there
are
always
strange
noises
at
night
and
they
say
the
stairs
here
were
made
more
than
two
hundred
years
the
girls
looked
at
each
other
with
a
sense
of
relief
but
they
waited
to
hear
the
opinion
of
the
queen
emily
as
usual
justified
the
confidence
placed
in
her
she
discovered
an
ingenious
method
of
putting
cecilia
s
suggestion
to
the
test
let
s
go
on
talking
she
said
if
cecilia
is
right
the
teachers
are
all
asleep
and
we
have
nothing
to
fear
from
them
if
she
s
wrong
we
shall
sooner
or
later
see
one
of
them
at
the
door
don
t
be
alarmed
miss
de
sor
catching
us
talking
at
night
in
this
school
only
means
a
reprimand
catching
us
with
a
light
ends
in
punishment
blow
out
the
francine
s
belief
in
the
ghost
was
too
sincerely
superstitious
to
be
shaken
she
started
up
in
bed
oh
don
t
leave
me
in
the
dark
i
ll
take
the
punishment
if
we
are
found
on
your
sacred
word
of
honor
emily
stipulated
yes
the
queen
s
sense
of
humor
was
tickled
there
s
something
funny
she
remarked
addressing
her
subjects
in
a
big
girl
like
this
coming
to
a
new
school
and
beginning
with
a
punishment
may
i
ask
if
you
are
a
foreigner
miss
de
sor
my
papa
is
a
spanish
gentleman
francine
answered
with
dignity
and
your
mamma
my
mamma
is
and
you
have
always
lived
in
the
west
indies
i
have
always
lived
in
the
island
of
emily
checked
off
on
her
fingers
the
different
points
thus
far
discovered
in
the
character
of
de
sor
s
daughter
she
s
ignorant
and
superstitious
and
foreign
and
rich
my
dear
forgive
the
familiarity
you
are
an
interesting
girl
and
we
must
really
know
more
of
you
entertain
the
bedroom
what
have
you
been
about
all
your
life
and
what
in
the
name
of
wonder
brings
you
here
before
you
begin
i
insist
on
one
condition
in
the
name
of
all
the
young
ladies
in
the
room
no
useful
information
about
the
west
indies
francine
disappointed
her
audience
she
was
ready
enough
to
make
herself
an
object
of
interest
to
her
companions
but
she
was
not
possessed
of
the
capacity
to
arrange
events
in
their
proper
order
necessary
to
the
recital
of
the
simplest
narrative
emily
was
obliged
to
help
her
by
means
of
questions
in
one
respect
the
result
justified
the
trouble
taken
to
obtain
it
a
sufficient
reason
was
discovered
for
the
extraordinary
appearance
of
a
new
pupil
on
the
day
before
the
school
closed
for
the
holidays
de
sor
s
elder
brother
had
left
him
an
estate
in
domingo
and
a
fortune
in
money
as
well
on
the
one
easy
condition
that
he
continued
to
reside
in
the
island
the
question
of
expense
being
now
beneath
the
notice
of
the
family
francine
had
been
sent
to
england
especially
recommended
to
miss
ladd
as
a
young
lady
with
grand
prospects
sorely
in
need
of
a
fashionable
education
the
voyage
had
been
so
timed
by
the
advice
of
the
schoolmistress
as
to
make
the
holidays
a
means
of
obtaining
this
object
privately
francine
was
to
be
taken
to
brighton
where
excellent
masters
could
be
obtained
to
assist
miss
ladd
with
six
weeks
before
her
she
might
in
some
degree
make
up
for
lost
time
and
when
the
school
opened
again
she
would
avoid
the
mortification
of
being
put
down
in
the
lowest
class
along
with
the
children
the
examination
of
miss
de
sor
having
produced
these
results
was
pursued
no
further
her
character
now
appeared
in
a
new
and
not
very
attractive
light
she
audaciously
took
to
herself
the
whole
credit
of
telling
her
story
i
think
it
s
my
turn
now
she
said
to
be
interested
and
amused
may
i
ask
you
to
begin
miss
emily
all
i
know
of
you
at
present
is
that
your
family
name
is
emily
held
up
her
hand
for
silence
was
the
mysterious
creaking
on
the
stairs
making
itself
heard
once
more
no
the
sound
that
had
caught
emily
s
quick
ear
came
from
the
beds
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
occupied
by
the
three
lazy
girls
with
no
new
alarm
to
disturb
them
effie
annis
and
priscilla
had
yielded
to
the
composing
influences
of
a
good
supper
and
a
warm
night
they
were
fast
asleep
and
the
stoutest
of
the
three
softly
as
became
a
young
lady
was
snoring
the
unblemished
reputation
of
the
bedroom
was
dear
to
emily
in
her
capacity
of
queen
she
felt
herself
humiliated
in
the
presence
of
the
new
pupil
if
that
fat
girl
ever
gets
a
lover
she
said
indignantly
i
shall
consider
it
my
duty
to
warn
the
poor
man
before
he
marries
her
her
ridiculous
name
is
euphemia
i
have
christened
her
far
more
appropriately
boiled
veal
no
color
in
her
hair
no
color
in
her
eyes
no
color
in
her
complexion
in
short
no
flavor
in
euphemia
you
naturally
object
to
snoring
pardon
me
if
i
turn
my
back
on
you
i
am
going
to
throw
my
slipper
at
the
soft
voice
of
cecilia
suspiciously
drowsy
in
tone
interposed
in
the
interests
of
mercy
she
can
t
help
it
poor
thing
and
she
really
isn
t
loud
enough
to
disturb
she
won
t
disturb
at
any
rate
rouse
yourself
cecilia
we
are
wide
awake
on
this
side
of
the
room
and
francine
says
it
s
our
turn
to
amuse
a
low
murmur
dying
away
gently
in
a
sigh
was
the
only
answer
sweet
cecilia
had
yielded
to
the
somnolent
influences
of
the
supper
and
the
night
the
soft
infection
of
repose
seemed
to
be
in
some
danger
of
communicating
itself
to
francine
her
large
mouth
opened
luxuriously
in
a
yawn
said
emily
miss
de
sor
became
wide
awake
in
an
instant
no
she
said
positively
you
are
quite
mistaken
if
you
think
i
am
going
to
sleep
please
exert
yourself
miss
emily
i
am
waiting
to
be
emily
appeared
to
be
unwilling
to
exert
herself
she
preferred
talking
of
the
weather
isn
t
the
wind
rising
she
said
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
it
the
leaves
in
the
garden
were
beginning
to
rustle
and
the
pattering
of
the
rain
sounded
on
the
windows
francine
as
her
straight
chin
proclaimed
to
all
students
of
physiognomy
was
an
obstinate
girl
determined
to
carry
her
point
she
tried
emily
s
own
system
on
emily
herself
she
put
questions
have
you
been
long
at
this
school
more
than
three
have
you
got
any
brothers
and
sisters
i
am
the
only
are
your
father
and
mother
alive
emily
suddenly
raised
herself
in
bed
wait
a
minute
she
said
i
think
i
hear
it
the
creaking
on
the
stairs
either
she
was
mistaken
or
the
change
for
the
worse
in
the
weather
made
it
not
easy
to
hear
slight
noises
in
the
house
the
wind
was
still
rising
the
passage
of
it
through
the
great
trees
in
the
garden
began
to
sound
like
the
fall
of
waves
on
a
distant
beach
it
drove
the
rain
a
heavy
downpour
by
this
time
rattling
against
the
windows
almost
a
storm
isn
t
it
emily
said
francine
s
last
question
had
not
been
answered
yet
she
took
the
earliest
opportunity
of
repeating
it
never
mind
the
weather
she
said
tell
me
about
your
father
and
mother
are
they
both
alive
emily
s
reply
only
related
to
one
of
her
parents
my
mother
died
before
i
was
old
enough
to
feel
my
and
your
father
emily
referred
to
another
relative
her
father
s
sister
since
i
have
grown
up
she
proceeded
my
good
aunt
has
been
a
second
mother
to
me
my
story
is
in
one
respect
the
reverse
of
yours
you
are
unexpectedly
rich
and
i
am
unexpectedly
poor
my
aunt
s
fortune
was
to
have
been
my
fortune
if
i
outlived
her
she
has
been
ruined
by
the
failure
of
a
bank
in
her
old
age
she
must
live
on
an
income
of
two
hundred
a
year
and
i
must
get
my
own
living
when
i
leave
surely
your
father
can
help
you
francine
persisted
his
property
is
landed
her
voice
faltered
as
she
referred
to
him
even
in
that
indirect
manner
it
is
entailed
his
nearest
male
relative
inherits
the
delicacy
which
is
easily
discouraged
was
not
one
of
the
weaknesses
in
the
nature
of
francine
do
i
understand
that
your
father
is
dead
she
asked
our
have
the
rest
of
us
at
their
mercy
only
give
them
time
and
they
carry
their
point
in
the
end
in
sad
subdued
tones
telling
of
reserves
of
feeling
seldom
revealed
to
strangers
emily
yielded
at
last
yes
she
said
my
father
is
long
ago
some
people
might
think
it
long
ago
i
was
very
fond
of
my
father
it
s
nearly
four
years
since
he
died
and
my
heart
still
aches
when
i
think
of
him
i
m
not
easily
depressed
by
troubles
miss
de
sor
but
his
death
was
sudden
he
was
in
his
grave
when
i
first
heard
of
it
and
oh
he
was
so
good
to
me
he
was
so
good
to
me
the
gay
little
creature
who
took
the
lead
among
them
all
who
was
the
life
and
soul
of
the
school
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
and
burst
out
crying
startled
and
to
do
her
justice
ashamed
francine
attempted
to
make
excuses
emily
s
generous
nature
passed
over
the
cruel
persistency
that
had
tortured
her
no
no
i
have
nothing
to
forgive
it
isn
t
your
fault
other
girls
have
not
mothers
and
brothers
and
sisters
and
get
reconciled
to
such
a
loss
as
mine
don
t
make
yes
but
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
feel
for
you
francine
insisted
without
the
slightest
approach
to
sympathy
in
face
voice
or
manner
when
my
uncle
died
and
left
us
all
the
money
papa
was
much
shocked
he
trusted
to
time
to
help
time
has
been
long
about
it
with
me
francine
i
am
afraid
there
is
something
perverse
in
my
nature
the
hope
of
meeting
again
in
a
better
world
seems
so
faint
and
so
far
away
no
more
of
it
now
let
us
talk
of
that
good
creature
who
is
asleep
on
the
other
side
of
you
did
i
tell
you
that
i
must
earn
my
own
bread
when
i
leave
school
well
cecilia
has
written
home
and
found
an
employment
for
me
not
a
situation
as
governess
something
quite
out
of
the
common
way
you
shall
hear
all
about
in
the
brief
interval
that
had
passed
the
weather
had
begun
to
change
again
the
wind
was
as
high
as
ever
but
to
judge
by
the
lessening
patter
on
the
windows
the
rain
was
passing
away
emily
began
she
was
too
grateful
to
her
friend
and
and
too
deeply
interested
in
her
story
to
notice
the
air
of
indifference
with
which
francine
settled
herself
on
her
pillow
to
hear
the
praises
of
cecilia
the
most
beautiful
girl
in
the
school
was
not
an
object
of
interest
to
a
young
lady
with
an
obstinate
chin
and
eyes
pouring
warm
from
the
speaker
s
heart
the
story
ran
smoothly
on
to
the
monotonous
accompaniment
of
the
moaning
wind
by
fine
degrees
francine
s
eyes
closed
opened
and
closed
again
toward
the
latter
part
of
the
narrative
emily
s
memory
became
for
the
moment
only
confused
between
two
events
she
stopped
to
consider
noticed
francine
s
silence
in
an
interval
when
she
might
have
said
a
word
of
encouragement
and
looked
closer
at
her
miss
de
sor
was
asleep
she
might
have
told
me
she
was
tired
emily
said
to
herself
quietly
well
the
best
thing
i
can
do
is
to
put
out
the
light
and
follow
her
as
she
took
up
the
extinguisher
the
bedroom
door
was
suddenly
opened
from
the
outer
side
a
tall
woman
robed
in
a
black
stood
on
the
threshold
looking
at
emily
chapter
iii
the
late
brown
the
woman
s
lean
hand
pointed
to
the
candle
don
t
put
it
saying
those
words
she
looked
round
the
room
and
satisfied
herself
that
the
other
girls
were
asleep
emily
laid
down
the
extinguisher
you
mean
to
report
us
of
course
she
said
i
am
the
only
one
awake
miss
jethro
lay
the
blame
on
i
have
no
intention
of
reporting
you
but
i
have
something
to
she
paused
and
pushed
her
thick
black
hair
already
streaked
with
gray
back
from
her
temples
her
eyes
large
and
dark
and
dim
rested
on
emily
with
a
sorrowful
interest
when
your
young
friends
wake
morning
she
went
on
you
can
tell
them
that
the
new
teacher
whom
nobody
likes
has
left
the
for
once
even
emily
was
bewildered
going
away
she
said
when
you
have
only
been
here
since
easter
miss
jethro
advanced
not
noticing
emily
s
expression
of
surprise
i
am
not
very
strong
at
the
best
of
times
she
continued
may
i
sit
down
on
your
bed
remarkable
on
other
occasions
for
her
cold
composure
her
voice
trembled
as
she
made
that
request
a
strange
request
surely
when
there
were
chairs
at
her
disposal
emily
made
room
for
her
with
the
dazed
look
of
a
girl
in
a
dream
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
jethro
one
of
the
things
i
can
t
endure
is
being
puzzled
if
you
don
t
mean
to
report
us
why
did
you
come
in
and
catch
me
with
the
light
miss
jethro
s
explanation
was
far
from
relieving
the
perplexity
which
her
conduct
had
caused
i
have
been
mean
enough
she
answered
to
listen
at
the
door
and
i
heard
you
talking
of
your
father
i
want
to
hear
more
about
him
that
is
why
i
came
you
knew
my
father
emily
exclaimed
i
believe
i
knew
him
but
his
name
is
so
common
there
are
so
many
thousands
of
james
browns
in
england
that
i
am
in
fear
of
making
a
mistake
i
heard
you
say
that
he
died
nearly
four
years
since
can
you
mention
any
particulars
which
might
help
to
enlighten
me
if
you
think
i
am
taking
a
liberty
emily
stopped
her
i
would
help
you
if
i
could
she
said
but
i
was
in
poor
health
at
the
time
and
i
was
staying
with
friends
far
away
in
scotland
to
try
change
of
air
the
news
of
my
father
s
death
brought
on
a
relapse
weeks
passed
before
i
was
strong
enough
to
travel
weeks
and
weeks
before
i
saw
his
grave
i
can
only
tell
you
what
i
know
from
my
aunt
he
died
of
miss
jethro
started
emily
looked
at
her
for
the
first
time
with
eyes
that
betrayed
a
feeling
of
distrust
what
have
i
said
to
startle
you
she
asked
nothing
i
am
nervous
in
stormy
weather
don
t
notice
she
went
on
abruptly
with
her
inquiries
will
you
tell
me
the
date
of
your
father
s
death
the
date
was
the
thirtieth
of
september
nearly
four
years
she
waited
after
that
reply
miss
jethro
was
silent
and
this
emily
continued
is
the
thirtieth
of
june
eighteen
hundred
and
you
can
now
judge
for
yourself
did
you
know
my
father
miss
jethro
answered
mechanically
using
the
same
words
i
did
know
your
emily
s
feeling
of
distrust
was
not
set
at
rest
i
never
heard
him
speak
of
you
she
said
in
her
younger
days
the
teacher
must
have
been
a
handsome
woman
her
features
still
suggested
the
idea
of
imperial
beauty
perhaps
jewish
in
its
origin
when
emily
said
i
never
heard
him
speak
of
you
the
color
flew
into
her
pallid
cheeks
her
dim
eyes
became
alive
again
with
a
momentary
light
she
left
her
seat
on
the
bed
and
turning
away
mastered
the
emotion
that
shook
her
how
hot
the
night
is
she
said
and
sighed
and
resumed
the
subject
with
a
steady
countenance
i
am
not
surprised
that
your
father
never
mentioned
me
to
she
spoke
quietly
but
her
face
was
paler
than
ever
she
sat
down
again
on
the
bed
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
she
asked
before
i
go
away
oh
i
only
mean
some
trifling
service
that
would
lay
you
under
no
obligation
and
would
not
oblige
you
to
keep
up
your
acquaintance
with
her
eyes
the
dim
black
eyes
that
must
once
have
been
irresistibly
beautiful
looked
at
emily
so
sadly
that
the
generous
girl
reproached
herself
for
having
doubted
her
father
s
friend
are
you
thinking
of
she
said
gently
when
you
ask
if
you
can
be
of
service
to
me
miss
jethro
made
no
direct
reply
you
were
fond
of
your
father
she
added
in
a
whisper
you
told
your
schoolfellow
that
your
heart
still
aches
when
you
speak
of
i
only
told
her
the
truth
emily
answered
simply
miss
jethro
shuddered
on
that
hot
night
shuddered
as
if
a
chill
had
struck
her
emily
held
out
her
hand
the
kind
feeling
that
had
been
roused
in
her
glittered
prettily
in
her
eyes
i
am
afraid
i
have
not
done
you
justice
she
said
will
you
forgive
me
and
shake
hands
miss
jethro
rose
and
drew
back
look
at
the
light
she
exclaimed
the
candle
was
all
burned
out
emily
still
offered
her
hand
and
still
miss
jethro
refused
to
see
it
there
is
just
light
enough
left
she
said
to
show
me
my
way
to
the
door
and
emily
caught
at
her
dress
and
stopped
her
why
won
t
you
shake
hands
with
me
she
asked
the
wick
of
the
candle
fell
over
in
the
socket
and
left
them
in
the
dark
emily
resolutely
held
the
teacher
s
dress
with
or
without
light
she
was
still
bent
on
making
miss
jethro
explain
herself
they
had
throughout
spoken
in
guarded
tones
fearing
to
disturb
the
sleeping
girls
the
sudden
darkness
had
its
inevitable
effect
their
voices
sank
to
whispers
now
my
father
s
friend
emily
pleaded
is
surely
my
friend
drop
the
why
you
can
never
be
why
not
let
me
go
emily
s
sense
of
forbade
her
to
persist
any
longer
i
beg
your
pardon
for
having
kept
you
here
against
your
will
she
said
and
dropped
her
hold
on
the
dress
miss
jethro
instantly
yielded
on
her
side
i
am
sorry
to
have
been
obstinate
she
answered
if
you
do
despise
me
it
is
after
all
no
more
than
i
have
her
hot
breath
beat
on
emily
s
face
the
unhappy
woman
must
have
bent
over
the
bed
as
she
made
her
confession
i
am
not
a
fit
person
for
you
to
associate
i
don
t
believe
it
miss
jethro
sighed
bitterly
young
and
warm
hearted
i
was
once
like
you
she
controlled
that
outburst
of
despair
her
next
words
were
spoken
in
steadier
tones
you
have
it

said
some
one
in
this
house
or
out
of
it
i
don
t
know
which
has
betrayed
me
to
the
mistress
of
the
school
a
wretch
in
my
situation
suspects
everybody
and
worse
still
does
it
without
reason
or
excuse
i
heard
you
girls
talking
when
you
ought
to
have
been
asleep
you
all
dislike
me
how
did
i
know
it
mightn
t
be
one
of
you
absurd
to
a
person
with
a
mind
i
went
halfway
up
the
stairs
and
felt
ashamed
of
myself
and
went
back
to
my
room
if
i
could
only
have
got
some
rest
ah
well
it
was
not
to
be
done
my
own
vile
suspicions
kept
me
awake
i
left
my
bed
again
you
know
what
i
heard
on
the
other
side
of
that
door
and
why
i
was
interested
in
hearing
it
your
father
never
told
me
he
had
a
daughter
miss
brown
at
this
school
was
any
miss
brown
to
me
i
had
no
idea
of
who
you
really
were
until
i
m
wandering
what
does
all
this
matter
to
you
miss
ladd
has
been
merciful
she
lets
me
go
without
exposing
me
you
can
guess
what
has
happened
no
not
even
yet
is
it
innocence
or
kindness
that
makes
you
so
slow
to
understand
my
dear
i
have
obtained
admission
to
this
respectable
house
by
means
of
false
references
and
i
have
been
discovered
you
know
why
you
must
not
be
the
friend
of
such
a
woman
as
i
am
once
more
and
emily
shrank
from
that
miserable
farewell
bid
me
she
said
but
don
t
bid
me
let
me
see
you
never
the
sound
of
the
door
was
just
audible
in
the
darkness
she
had
spoken
she
had
gone
never
to
be
seen
by
emily
again
miserable
interesting
unfathomable
creature
the
problem
that
night
of
emily
s
waking
thoughts
the
phantom
of
her
dreams
bad
or
good
she
asked
herself
false
for
she
listened
at
the
door
true
for
she
told
me
the
tale
of
her
own
disgrace
a
friend
of
my
father
and
she
never
knew
that
he
had
a
daughter
refined
accomplished
and
she
stoops
to
use
a
false
reference
who
is
to
reconcile
such
contradictions
as
these
dawn
looked
in
at
the
window
dawn
of
the
memorable
day
which
was
for
emily
the
beginning
of
a
new
life
the
years
were
before
her
and
the
years
in
their
course
reveal
baffling
mysteries
of
life
and
death
chapter
iv
miss
ladd
s
francine
was
awakened
the
next
morning
by
one
of
the
housemaids
bringing
up
her
breakfast
on
a
tray
astonished
at
this
concession
to
laziness
in
an
institution
devoted
to
the
practice
of
all
virtues
she
looked
round
the
bedroom
was
deserted
the
other
young
ladies
are
as
busy
as
bees
miss
the
housemaid
explained
they
were
up
and
dressed
two
hours
ago
and
the
breakfast
has
been
cleared
away
long
since
it
s
miss
emily
s
fault
she
wouldn
t
allow
them
to
wake
you
she
said
you
could
be
of
no
possible
use
downstairs
and
you
had
better
be
treated
like
a
visitor
miss
cecilia
was
so
distressed
at
your
missing
your
breakfast
that
she
spoke
to
the
housekeeper
and
i
was
sent
up
to
you
please
to
excuse
it
if
the
tea
s
cold
this
is
grand
day
and
we
are
all
in
inquiring
what
grand
day
meant
and
why
it
produced
this
extraordinary
result
in
a
ladies
school
francine
discovered
that
the
first
day
of
the
vacation
was
devoted
to
the
distribution
of
prizes
in
the
presence
of
parents
guardians
and
friends
an
entertainment
was
added
comprising
those
merciless
tests
of
human
endurance
called
recitations
light
refreshments
and
musical
performances
being
distributed
at
intervals
to
encourage
the
exhausted
audience
the
local
newspaper
sent
a
reporter
to
describe
the
proceedings
and
some
of
miss
ladd
s
young
ladies
enjoyed
the
intoxicating
luxury
of
seeing
their
names
in
print
it
begins
at
three
o
clock
the
housemaid
went
on
and
what
with
practicing
and
rehearsing
and
ornamenting
the
schoolroom
there
s
a
hubbub
fit
to
make
a
person
s
head
spin
besides
which
said
the
girl
lowering
her
voice
and
approaching
a
little
nearer
to
francine
we
have
all
been
taken
by
surprise
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
miss
jethro
left
us
without
saying
to
who
is
miss
jethro
the
new
teacher
miss
we
none
of
us
liked
her
and
we
all
suspect
there
s
something
wrong
miss
ladd
and
the
clergyman
had
a
long
talk
together
yesterday
in
private
you
know
and
they
sent
for
miss
jethro
which
looks
bad
doesn
t
it
is
there
anything
more
i
can
do
for
you
miss
it
s
a
beautiful
day
after
the
rain
if
i
was
you
i
should
go
and
enjoy
myself
in
the
having
finished
her
breakfast
francine
decided
on
profiting
by
this
sensible
suggestion
the
servant
who
showed
her
the
way
to
the
garden
was
not
favorably
impressed
by
the
new
pupil
francine
s
temper
asserted
itself
a
little
too
plainly
in
her
face
to
a
girl
possessing
a
high
opinion
of
her
own
importance
it
was
not
very
agreeable
to
feel
herself
excluded
as
an
illiterate
stranger
from
the
one
absorbing
interest
of
her
schoolfellows
will
the
time
ever
come
she
wondered
bitterly
when
i
shall
win
a
prize
and
sing
and
play
before
all
the
company
how
i
should
enjoy
making
the
girls
envy
me
a
broad
lawn
overshadowed
at
one
end
by
fine
old
trees
flower
beds
and
shrubberies
and
winding
paths
prettily
and
invitingly
laid
out
made
the
garden
a
welcome
refuge
on
that
fine
summer
morning
the
novelty
of
the
scene
after
her
experience
in
the
west
indies
the
delicious
breezes
cooled
by
the
rain
of
the
night
exerted
their
cheering
influence
even
on
the
sullen
disposition
of
francine
she
smiled
in
spite
of
herself
as
she
followed
the
pleasant
paths
and
heard
the
birds
singing
their
summer
songs
over
her
head
wandering
among
the
trees
which
occupied
a
considerable
extent
of
ground
she
passed
into
an
open
space
beyond
and
discovered
an
old
overgrown
by
aquatic
plants
driblets
of
water
trickled
from
a
dilapidated
fountain
in
the
middle
on
the
further
side
of
the
pond
the
ground
sloped
downward
toward
the
south
and
revealed
over
a
low
paling
a
pretty
view
of
a
village
and
its
church
backed
by
fir
woods
mounting
the
heathy
sides
of
a
range
of
hills
beyond
a
fanciful
little
wooden
building
imitating
the
form
of
a
swiss
cottage
was
placed
so
as
to
command
the
prospect
near
it
in
the
shadow
of
the
building
stood
a
rustic
chair
and
table
with
a
on
one
and
a
portfolio
on
the
other
fluttering
over
the
grass
at
the
mercy
of
the
capricious
breeze
was
a
neglected
sheet
of
francine
ran
round
the
pond
and
picked
up
the
paper
just
as
it
was
on
the
point
of
being
tilted
into
the
water
it
contained
a
sketch
in
water
colors
of
the
village
and
the
woods
and
francine
had
looked
at
the
view
itself
with
indifference
the
picture
of
the
view
interested
her
ordinary
visitors
to
galleries
of
art
which
admit
students
show
the
same
strange
perversity
the
work
of
the
copyist
commands
their
whole
attention
they
take
no
interest
in
the
original
picture
looking
up
from
the
sketch
francine
was
startled
she
discovered
a
man
at
the
window
of
the
swiss
watching
her
when
you
have
done
with
that
drawing
he
said
quietly
please
let
me
have
it
back
he
was
tall
and
thin
and
dark
his
intelligent
face
hidden
as
to
the
lower
part
of
it
by
a
curly
black
beard
would
have
been
absolutely
handsome
even
in
the
eyes
of
a
schoolgirl
but
for
the
deep
furrows
that
marked
it
prematurely
between
the
eyebrows
and
at
the
sides
of
the
mouth
in
the
same
way
an
underlying
mockery
impaired
the
attraction
of
his
otherwise
refined
and
gentle
manner
among
his
children
and
dogs
were
the
only
critics
who
appreciated
his
merits
without
discovering
the
defects
which
lessened
the
favorable
appreciation
of
him
by
men
and
women
he
dressed
neatly
but
his
morning
coat
was
badly
made
and
his
picturesque
felt
hat
was
too
old
in
short
there
seemed
to
be
no
good
quality
about
him
which
was
not
perversely
associated
with
a
drawback
of
some
kind
he
was
one
of
those
harmless
and
luckless
men
possessed
of
excellent
qualities
who
fail
nevertheless
to
achieve
popularity
in
their
social
sphere
francine
handed
his
sketch
to
him
through
the
window
doubtful
whether
the
words
that
he
had
addressed
to
her
were
spoken
in
jest
or
in
earnest
i
only
presumed
to
touch
your
drawing
she
said
because
it
was
in
what
danger
he
inquired
francine
pointed
to
the
pond
if
i
had
not
been
in
time
to
pick
it
up
it
would
have
been
blown
into
the
do
you
think
it
was
worth
picking
up
putting
that
question
he
looked
first
at
the
sketch
then
at
the
view
which
it
represented
then
back
again
at
the
sketch
the
corners
of
his
mouth
turned
upward
with
a
humorous
expression
of
scorn
madam
nature
he
said
i
beg
your
with
those
words
he
composedly
tore
his
work
of
art
into
small
pieces
and
scattered
them
out
of
the
window
what
a
pity
said
francine
he
joined
her
on
the
ground
outside
the
cottage
why
is
it
a
pity
he
asked
such
a
nice
it
isn
t
a
nice
you
re
not
very
polite
he
looked
at
her
and
sighed
as
if
he
pitied
so
young
a
woman
for
having
a
temper
so
ready
to
take
offense
in
his
flattest
contradictions
he
always
preserved
the
character
of
a
man
put
it
in
plain
words
miss
he
replied
i
have
offended
the
predominant
sense
in
your
nature
your
sense
of
you
don
t
like
to
be
told
even
indirectly
that
you
know
nothing
of
art
in
these
days
everybody
knows
everything
and
thinks
nothing
worth
knowing
after
all
but
beware
how
you
presume
on
an
appearance
of
indifference
which
is
nothing
but
conceit
in
disguise
the
ruling
passion
of
civilized
humanity
is
conceit
you
may
try
the
regard
of
your
dearest
friend
in
any
other
way
and
be
forgiven
ruffle
the
smooth
surface
of
your
friend
s
and
there
will
be
an
acknowledged
coolness
between
you
which
will
last
for
life
excuse
me
for
giving
you
the
benefit
of
my
trumpery
experience
this
sort
of
smart
talk
is
form
of
conceit
can
i
be
of
use
to
you
in
some
better
way
are
you
looking
for
one
of
our
young
ladies
francine
began
to
feel
a
certain
reluctant
interest
in
him
when
he
spoke
of
our
young
she
asked
if
he
belonged
to
the
school
the
corners
of
his
mouth
turned
up
again
i
m
one
of
the
masters
he
said
are
going
to
belong
to
the
school
too
francine
bent
her
head
with
a
gravity
and
condescension
intended
to
keep
him
at
his
proper
distance
far
from
being
discouraged
he
permitted
his
curiosity
to
take
additional
liberties
are
you
to
have
the
misfortune
of
being
one
of
my
pupils
he
asked
i
don
t
know
who
you
you
won
t
be
much
wiser
when
you
do
know
my
name
is
alban
francine
corrected
herself
i
mean
i
don
t
know
what
you
alban
morris
pointed
to
the
fragments
of
his
sketch
from

i
am
a
bad
artist
he
said
some
bad
artists
become
royal
academicians
some
take
to
drink
some
get
a
pension
and
some
i
am
one
of
them
find
refuge
in
schools
drawing

at
this
school
will
you
take
my
advice
spare
your
good
father
s
pocket
say
you
don
t
want
to
learn
to
he
was
so
gravely
in
earnest
that
francine
burst
out
laughing
you
are
a
strange
man
she
said
wrong
again
miss
i
am
only
an
unhappy
the
furrows
in
his
face
deepened
the
latent
humor
died
out
of
his
eyes
he
turned
to
the
window
and
took
up
a
pipe
and
tobacco
pouch
left
on
the
ledge
i
lost
my
only
friend
last
year
he
said
since
the
death
of
my
dog
my
pipe
is
the
one
companion
i
have
left
naturally
i
am
not
allowed
to
enjoy
the
honest
fellow
s
society
in
the
presence
of
ladies
they
have
their
own
taste
in
perfumes
their
clothes
and
their
letters
reek
with
the
foetid
secretion
of
the
musk
deer
the
clean
vegetable
smell
of
tobacco
is
unendurable
to
them
allow
me
to
retire
and
let
me
thank
you
for
the
trouble
you
took
to
save
my
the
tone
of
indifference
in
which
he
expressed
his
gratitude
piqued
francine
she
resented
it
by
drawing
her
own
conclusion
from
what
he
had
said
of
the
ladies
and
the
musk
deer
i
was
wrong
in
admiring
your
drawing
she
remarked
and
wrong
again
in
thinking
you
a
strange
man
am
i
wrong
for
the
third
time
in
believing
that
you
dislike
women
i
am
sorry
to
say
you
are
right
alban
morris
answered
gravely
is
there
not
even
one
exception
the
instant
the
words
passed
her
lips
she
saw
that
there
was
some
secretly
sensitive
feeling
in
him
which
she
had
hurt
his
black
brows
gathered
into
a
frown
his
piercing
eyes
looked
at
her
with
angry
surprise
it
was
over
in
a
moment
he
raised
his
shabby
hat
and
made
her
a
bow
there
is
a
sore
place
still
left
in
me
he
said
and
you
have
innocently
hit
it
before
she
could
speak
again
he
had
turned
the
corner
of
the
and
was
lost
to
view
in
a
shrubbery
on
the
westward
side
of
the
grounds

turned
back
again
by

of
the
trees
so
far
her
interview
with
the
had
helped
to
pass
the
time
some
girls
might
have
found
it
no
easy
task
to
arrive
at
a
true
view
of
the
character
of
alban
morris
francine
s
essentially
superficial
observation
set
him
down
as
a
little
mad
and
left
him
there
judged
and
dismissed
to
her
own
entire
satisfaction
arriving
at
the
lawn
she
discovered
emily
pacing
backward
and
forward
with
her
head
down
and
her
hands
behind
her
deep
in
thought
francine
s
high
opinion
of
herself
would
have
carried
her
past
any
of
the
other
girls
unless
they
had
made
special
advances
to
her
she
stopped
and
looked
at
emily
it
is
the
sad
fate
of
little
women
in
general
to
grow
too
fat
and
to
be
born
with
short
legs
emily
s
slim
figure
spoke
for
itself
as
to
the
first
of
these
misfortunes
and
asserted
its
happy
freedom
from
the
second
if
she
only
walked
across
a
room
nature
had
built
her
from
head
to
foot
on
a
in
perfect
proportion
tall
or
short
matters
little
to
the
result
in
women
who
possess
the
first
and
foremost
advantage
of
beginning
well
in
their
bones
when
they
live
to
old
age
they
often
astonish
thoughtless
men
who
walk
behind
them
in
the
street
i
give
you
my
honor
she
was
as
easy
and
upright
as
a
young
girl
and
when
you
got
in
front
of
her
and
looked
white
hair
and
seventy
years
of
francine
approached
emily
moved
by
a
rare
impulse
in
her
nature
the
impulse
to
be
sociable
you
look
out
of
spirits
she
began
surely
you
don
t
regret
leaving
school
in
her
present
mood
emily
took
the
opportunity
in
the
popular
phrase
of
snubbing
francine
you
have
guessed
wrong
i
do
regret
she
answered
i
have
found
in
cecilia
my
dearest
friend
at
school
and
school
brought
with
it
the
change
in
my
life
which
has
helped
me
to
bear
the
loss
of
my
father
if
you
must
know
what
i
was
thinking
of
just
now
i
was
thinking
of
my
aunt
she
has
not
answered
my
last
letter
and
i
m
beginning
to
be
afraid
she
is
i
m
very
sorry
said

you
don

know
my

you
have
only
known
me

are
you

silent
without
realizing
it
she
was
beginning
to
feel
the
dominant
influence
that
emily
exercised
over
the
weaker
natures
that
came
in
contact
with
her
to
find
herself
irresistibly
attracted
by
a
stranger
at
a
new
school
an
unfortunate
little
creature
whose
destiny
was
to
earn
her
own
living
filled
the
narrow
mind
of
miss
de
sor
with
perplexity
having
waited
in
vain
for
a
reply
emily
turned
away
and
resumed
the
train
of
thought
which
her
schoolfellow
had
interrupted
by
an
association
of
ideas
of
which
she
was
not
herself
aware
she
now
passed
from
thinking
of
her
aunt
to
thinking
of
miss
jethro
the
interview
of
the
previous
night
had
dwelt
on
her
mind
at
intervals
in
the
hours
of
the
new
day
acting
on
instinct
rather
than
on
reason
she
had
kept
that
remarkable
incident
in
her
school
life
a
secret
from
every
one
no
discoveries
had
been
made
by
other
persons
in
speaking
to
her
staff
of
teachers
miss
ladd
had
alluded
to
the
affair
in
the
most
cautious
terms
circumstances
of
a
private
nature
have
obliged
the
lady
to
retire
from
my
school
when
we
meet
after
the
holidays
another
teacher
will
be
in
her
there
miss
ladd
s
explanation
had
begun
and
ended
inquiries
addressed
to
the
servants
had
led
to
no
result
miss
jethro
s
luggage
was
to
be
forwarded
to
the
london
terminus
of
the
railway
and
miss
jethro
herself
had
baffled
investigation
by
leaving
the
school
on
foot
emily
s
interest
in
the
lost
teacher
was
not
the
transitory
interest
of
curiosity
her
father
s
mysterious
friend
was
a
person
whom
she
honestly
desired
to
see
again
perplexed
by
the
difficulty
of
finding
a
means
of
tracing
miss
jethro
she
reached
the
shady
limit
of
the
trees
and
turned
to
walk
back
again
approaching
the
place
at
which
she
and
francine
had
met
an
idea
occurred
to
her
it
was
just
possible
that
miss
jethro
might
not
be
unknown
to
her
aunt
still
meditating
on
the
cold
reception
that
she
had
encountered
and
still
feeling
the
influence
which
mastered
her
in
spite
of
herself
francine
interpreted
emily
s
return
as
an
implied
expression
of
regret
she
advanced
with
a
constrained
smile
and
spoke
first
how
are
the
young
ladies
getting
on
in
the
schoolroom
she
asked
by
way
of
renewing
the
conversation
emily
s
face
assumed
a
look
of
surprise
which
said
plainly
can
t
you
take
a
hint
and
leave
me
to
myself
francine
was
constitutionally
impenetrable
to
reproof
of
this
sort
her
thick
skin
was
not
even
tickled
why
are
you
not
helping
them
she
went
on
you
who
have
the
clearest
head
among
us
and
take
the
lead
in
everything
it
may
be
a
humiliating
confession
to
make
yet
it
is
surely
true
that
we
are
all
accessible
to
flattery
different
tastes
appreciate
different
methods
of
burning
incense
but
the
perfume
is
more
or
less
agreeable
to
all
varieties
of
noses
francine
s
method
had
its
tranquilizing
effect
on
emily
she
answered
indulgently
miss
de
sor
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
nothing
to
do
with
it
no
prizes
to
win
before
you
leave
school
i
won
all
the
prizes
years
but
there
are
recitations
surely
you
recite
harmless
words
in
themselves
pursuing
the
same
smooth
course
of
flattery
as
before
but
with
what
a
different
result
emily
s
face
reddened
with
anger
the
moment
they
were
spoken
having
already
irritated
alban
morris
unlucky
francine
by
a
second
mischievous
interposition
of
accident
had
succeeded
in
making
emily
smart
next
who
has
told
you
she
burst
out
i
insist
on
knowing
nobody
has
told
me
anything
francine
declared
piteously
nobody
has
told
you
how
i
have
been
insulted
no
indeed
oh
miss
brown
who
could
insult
in
a
man
the
sense
of
injury
does
sometimes
submit
to
the
discipline
of
silence
in
a
woman
never
suddenly
reminded
of
her
past
wrongs
by
the
pardonable
error
of
a
polite
schoolfellow
emily
committed
the
startling
inconsistency
of
appealing
to
the
sympathies
of
francine
would
you
believe
it
i
have
been
forbidden
to
recite
i
the
head
girl
of
the
school
oh
not
it
happened
a
month
ago
when
we
were
all
in
consultation
making
our
arrangements
miss
ladd
asked
me
if
i
had
decided
on
a
piece
to
recite
i
said
i
have
not
only
decided
i
have
learned
the
and
what
may
it
be
the
in
there
was
a
howl
i
can
call
it
by
no
other
name
a
howl
of
indignation
a
man
s
soliloquy
and
worse
still
a
murdering
man
s
soliloquy
recited
by
one
of
miss
ladd
s
young
ladies
before
an
audience
of
parents
and
guardians
that
was
the
tone
they
took
with
me
i
was
as
firm
as
a
rock
the
or
nothing
the
result
is
nothing
an
insult
to
shakespeare
and
an
insult
to
me
i
felt
it
i
feel
it
still
i
was
prepared
for
any
sacrifice
in
the
cause
of
the
drama
if
miss
ladd
had
met
me
in
a
proper
spirit
do
you
know
what
i
would
have
done
i
would
have
played
macbeth
in
costume
just
hear
me
and
judge
for
yourself
i
begin
with
a
dreadful
vacancy
in
my
eyes
and
a
hollow
moaning
in
my
voice
is
this
a
dagger
that
i
see
before
me
reciting
with
her
face
toward
the
trees
emily
started
dropped
the
character
of
macbeth
and
instantly
became
herself
again
herself
with
a
rising
color
and
an
angry
brightening
of
the
eyes
excuse
me
i
can
t
trust
my
memory
i
must
get
the
with
that
abrupt
apology
she
walked
away
rapidly
in
the
direction
of
the
house
in
some
surprise
francine
turned
and
looked
at
the
trees
she
discovered
in
full
retreat
on
his
side
the
eccentric
alban
morris
did
he
too
admire
the
and
was
he
modestly
desirous
of
hearing
it
recited
without
showing
himself
in
that
case
why
should
emily
whose
besetting
weakness
was
certainly
not
want
of
confidence
in
her
own
resources
leave
the
garden
the
moment
she
caught
sight
of
him
francine
consulted
her
instincts
she
had
just
arrived
at
a
conclusion
which
expressed
itself
outwardly
by
a
malicious
smile
when
gentle
cecilia
appeared
on
the
lawn
a
lovable
object
in
a
broad
straw
hat
and
a
white
dress
with
a
nosegay
in
her
bosom
smiling
and
fanning
herself
it
s
so
hot
in
the
schoolroom
she
said
and
some
of
the
girls
poor
things
are
so
at
rehearsal
i
have
made
my
escape
i
hope
you
got
your
breakfast
miss
de
sor
what
have
you
been
doing
here
all
by
yourself
i
have
been
making
an
interesting
discovery
francine
replied
an
interesting
discovery
in
our
garden
what
it
be
the
my
dear
is
in
love
with
emily
perhaps
she
doesn
t
care
about
him
or
perhaps
i
have
been
an
innocent
obstacle
in
the
way
of
an
appointment
between
cecilia
had
breakfasted
to
her
heart
s
content
on
her
favorite
dish
buttered
eggs
she
was
in
such
good
spirits
that
she
was
inclined
to
be
coquettish
even
when
there
was
no
man
present
to
fascinate
we
are
not
allowed
to
talk
about
love
in
this
school
she
said
and
hid
her
face
behind
her
fan
besides
if
it
came
to
miss
ladd
s
ears
poor
morris
might
lose
his
but
isn
t
it
true
asked
francine
it
may
be
true
my
dear
but
nobody
knows
emily
hasn
t
breathed
a
word
about
it
to
any
of
us
and
morris
keeps
his
own
secret
now
and
then
we
catch
him
looking
at
her
and
we
draw
our
own
did
you
meet
emily
on
your
way
here
yes
and
she
passed
without
speaking
to
thinking
perhaps
of
cecilia
shook
her
head
thinking
francine
of
the
new
life
before
her
and
regretting
i
am
afraid
that
she
ever
confided
her
hopes
and
wishes
to
me
did
she
tell
you
last
night
what
her
prospects
are
when
she
leaves
school
she
told
me
you
had
been
very
kind
in
helping
her
i
daresay
i
should
have
heard
more
if
i
had
not
fallen
asleep
what
is
she
going
to
do
to
live
in
a
dull
house
far
away
in
the
north
cecilia
answered
with
only
old
people
in
it
she
will
have
to
write
and
translate
for
a
great
scholar
who
is
studying
mysterious
inscriptions
hieroglyphics
i
think
they
are
called
found
among
the
ruins
of
central
america
it
s
really
no
laughing
matter
francine
emily
made
a
joke
of
it
too
i
ll
take
anything
but
a
situation
as
a
governess
she
said
the
children
who
have
me
to
teach
them
would
be
to
be
pitied
indeed
she
begged
and
prayed
me
to
help
her
to
get
an
honest
living
what
could
i
do
i
could
only
write
home
to
papa
he
is
a
member
of
parliament
and
everybody
who
wants
a
place
seems
to
think
he
is
bound
to
find
it
for
them
as
it
happened
he
had
heard
from
an
old
friend
of
his
a
certain
sir
jervis
redwood
who
was
in
search
of
a
secretary
being
in
favor
of
letting
the
women
compete
for
employment
with
the
men
sir
jervis
was
willing
to
try
what
he
calls
a
isn
t
that
a
horrid
way
of
speaking
of
us
and
miss
ladd
says
it
s
ungrammatical
besides
papa
had
written
back
to
say
he
knew
of
no
lady
whom
he
could
recommend
when
he
got
my
letter
speaking
of
emily
he
kindly
wrote
again
in
the
interval
sir
jervis
had
received
two
applications
for
the
vacant
place
they
were
both
from
old
ladies
and
he
declined
to
employ
because
they
were
old
francine
suggested
maliciously
you
shall
hear
him
give
his
own
reasons
my
dear
papa
sent
me
an
extract
from
his
letter
it
made
me
rather
angry
and
perhaps
for
that
reason
i
think
i
can
repeat
it
word
for
word
we
are
four
old
people
in
this
house
and
we
don
t
want
a
fifth
let
us
have
a
young
one
to
cheer
us
if
your
daughter
s
friend
likes
the
terms
and
is
not
encumbered
with
a
sweetheart
i
will
send
for
her
when
the
school
breaks
up
at
coarse
and
selfish
isn
t
it
however
emily
didn
t
agree
with
me
when
i
showed
her
the
extract
she
accepted
the
place
very
much
to
her
aunt
s
surprise
and
regret
when
that
excellent
person
heard
of
it
now
that
the
time
has
come
though
emily
won
t
acknowledge
it
i
believe
she
secretly
shrinks
poor
dear
from
the
very
likely
francine
agreed
without
even
a
pretense
of
sympathy
but
tell
me
who
are
the
four
old
people
first
sir
jervis
himself
seventy
last
birthday
next
his
unmarried
sister
nearly
eighty
next
his
rook
well
past
sixty
and
last
his
s
wife
who
considers
herself
young
being
only
a
little
over
forty
that
is
the
household
rook
is
coming
to
attend
emily
on
the
journey
to
the
north
and
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
emily
will
like
a
disagreeable
woman
i
suppose
no
not
exactly
that
rather
odd
and
flighty
the
fact
is
rook
has
had
her
troubles
and
perhaps
they
have
a
little
unsettled
her
she
and
her
husband
used
to
keep
the
village
inn
close
to
our
park
we
know
all
about
them
at
home
i
am
sure
i
pity
these
poor
people
what
are
you
looking
at
francine
feeling
no
sort
of
interest
in
and
rook
francine
was
studying
her
schoolfellow
s
lovely
face
in
search
of
defects
she
had
already
discovered
that
cecilia
s
eyes
were
placed
too
widely
apart
and
that
her
chin
wanted
size
and
character
i
was
admiring
your
complexion
dear
she
answered
coolly
well
and
why
do
you
pity
the
rooks
simple
cecilia
smiled
and
went
on
with
her
story
they
are
obliged
to
go
out
to
service
in
their
old
age
through
a
misfortune
for
which
they
are
in
no
way
to
blame
their
customers
deserted
the
inn
and
rook
became
bankrupt
the
inn
got
what
they
call
a
bad
name
in
a
very
dreadful
way
there
was
a
murder
committed
in
the
a
murder
cried
francine
oh
this
is
exciting
you
provoking
girl
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
about
it
before
i
didn
t
think
of
it
said
cecilia
placidly
do
go
on
were
you
at
home
when
it
happened
i
was
here
at
you
saw
the
newspapers
i
suppose
miss
ladd
doesn
t
allow
us
to
read
newspapers
i
did
hear
of
it
however
in
letters
from
home
not
that
there
was
much
in
the
letters
they
said
it
was
too
horrible
to
be
described
the
poor
murdered
gentleman
francine
was
unaffectedly
shocked
a
gentleman
she
exclaimed
how
dreadful
the
poor
man
was
a
stranger
in
our
part
of
the
country
cecilia
resumed
and
the
police
were
puzzled
about
the
motive
for
a
murder
his
pocketbook
was
missing
but
his
watch
and
his
rings
were
found
on
the
body
i
remember
the
initials
on
his
linen
because
they
were
the
same
as
my
mother
s
initial
before
she
was
married
j
really
francine
that
s
all
i
know
about
surely
you
know
whether
the
murderer
was
discovered
oh
yes
of
course
i
know
that
the
government
offered
a
reward
and
clever
people
were
sent
from
london
to
help
the
county
police
nothing
came
of
it
the
murderer
has
never
been
discovered
from
that
time
to
when
did
it
happen
it
happened
in
the
the
autumn
of
last
year
no
no
nearly
four
years
chapter
vi
on
the
way
to
the
village
alban
morris
discovered
by
emily
in
concealment
among
the
trees
was
not
content
with
retiring
to
another
part
of
the
grounds
he
pursued
his
retreat
careless
in
what
direction
it
might
take
him
to
a
footpath
across
the
fields
which
led
to
the
highroad
and
the
railway
station
miss
ladd
s
was
in
that
state
of
nervous
irritability
which
seeks
relief
in
rapidity
of
motion
public
opinion
in
the
neighborhood
especially
public
opinion
among
the
women
had
long
since
decided
that
his
manners
were
offensive
and
his
temper
incurably
bad
the
men
who
happened
to
pass
him
on
the
footpath
said
grudgingly
the
women
took
no
notice
of
him
with
one
exception
she
was
young
and
saucy
and
seeing
him
walking
at
the
top
of
his
speed
on
the
way
to
the
railway
station
she
called
after
him
don
t
be
in
a
hurry
sir
you
re
in
plenty
of
time
for
the
london
to
her
astonishment
he
suddenly
stopped
his
reputation
for
rudeness
was
so
well
established
that
she
moved
away
to
a
safe
distance
before
she
ventured
to
look
at
him
again
he
took
no
notice
of
her
he
seemed
to
be
considering
with
himself
the
frolicsome
young
woman
had
done
him
a
service
she
had
suggested
an
idea
suppose
i
go
to
london
he
thought
why
not
the
school
is
breaking
up
for
the
holidays
and
is
going
away
like
the
rest
of
he
looked
round
in
the
direction
of
the
schoolhouse
if
i
go
back
to
wish
her
she
will
keep
out
of
my
way
and
part
with
me
at
the
last
moment
like
a
stranger
after
my
experience
of
women
to
be
in
love
again
in
love
with
a
girl
who
is
young
enough
to
be
my
daughter
what
a
fool
what
a
driveling
degraded
fool
i
must
be
hot
tears
rose
in
his
eyes
he
dashed
them
away
savagely
and
went
on
again
faster
than
ever
resolved
to
pack
up
at
once
at
his
lodgings
in
the
village
and
to
take
his
departure
by
the
next
train
at
the
point
where
the
footpath
led
into
the
road
he
came
to
a
standstill
for
the
second
time
the
cause
was
once
more
a
person
of
the
sex
associated
in
his
mind
with
a
bitter
sense
of
injury
on
this
occasion
the
person
was
only
a
miserable
little
child
crying
over
the
fragments
of
a
broken
jug
alban
morris
looked
at
her
with
his
grimly
humorous
smile
so
you
ve
broken
a
jug
he
remarked
and
spilt
father
s
beer
the
child
answered
her
frail
little
body
shook
with
terror
mother
ll
beat
me
when
i
go
home
she
said
what
does
mother
do
when
you
bring
the
jug
back
safe
and
sound
alban
asked
gives
me
very
well
now
listen
to
me
mother
shall
give
you
bread
and
butter
again
this
the
child
stared
at
him
with
the
tears
suspended
in
her
eyes
he
went
on
talking
to
her
as
seriously
as
ever
you
understand
what
i
have
just
said
to
you
yes
have
you
got
a
no
then
dry
your
eyes
with
he
tossed
his
handkerchief
to
her
with
one
hand
and
picked
up
a
fragment
of
the
broken
jug
with
the
other
this
will
do
for
a
pattern
he
said
to
himself
the
child
stared
at
the
handkerchief
stared
at
alban
took
courage
and
rubbed
vigorously
at
her
eyes
the
instinct
which
is
worth
all
the
reason
that
ever
pretended
to
enlighten
mankind
the
instinct
that
never
deceives
told
this
little
ignorant
creature
that
she
had
found
a
friend
she
returned
the
handkerchief
in
grave
silence
alban
took
her
up
in
his
arms
your
eyes
are
dry
and
your
face
is
fit
to
be
seen
he
said
will
you
give
me
a
kiss
the
child
gave
him
a
resolute
kiss
with
a
smack
in
it
now
come
and
get
another
jug
he
said
as
he
put
her
down
her
red
round
eyes
opened
wide
in
alarm
have
you
got
money
enough
she
asked
alban
slapped
his
pocket
yes
i
have
he
answered
that
s
a
good
thing
said
the
child
come
they
went
together
hand
in
hand
to
the
village
and
bought
the
new
jug
and
had
it
filled
at
the
the
thirsty
father
was
at
the
upper
end
of
the
fields
where
they
were
making
a
drain
alban
carried
the
jug
until
they
were
within
sight
of
the
laborer
you
haven
t
far
to
go
he
said
mind
you
don
t
drop
it
again
what
s
the
matter
now
i
m
why
oh
give
me
the
she
almost
snatched
it
out
of
his
hand
if
she
let
the
precious
minutes
slip
away
there
might
be
another
beating
in
store
for
her
at
the
drain
her
father
was
not
of
an
indulgent
disposition
when
his
children
were
late
in
bringing
his
beer
on
the
point
of
hurrying
away
without
a
word
of
farewell
she
remembered
the
laws
of
politeness
as
taught
at
the
infant
school
and
dropped
her
little
curtsey
and
said
thank
you
that
bitter
sense
of
injury
was
still
in
alban
s
mind
as
he
looked
after
her
what
a
pity
she
should
grow
up
to
be
a
woman
he
said
to
himself
the
adventure
of
the
broken
jug
had
delayed
his
return
to
his
lodgings
by
more
than
half
an
hour
when
he
reached
the
road
once
more
the
cheap
from
the
north
had
stopped
at
the
station
he
heard
the
ringing
of
the
bell
as
it
resumed
the
journey
to
london
one
of
the
passengers
judging
by
the
handbag
that
she
carried
had
not
stopped
at
the
village
as
she
advanced
toward
him
along
the
road
he
remarked
that
she
was
a
small
wiry
active
woman
dressed
in
bright
colors
combined
with
a
deplorable
want
of
taste
her
aquiline
nose
seemed
to
be
her
most
striking
feature
as
she
came
nearer
it
might
have
been
fairly
proportioned
to
the
rest
of
her
face
in
her
younger
days
before
her
cheeks
had
lost
flesh
and
roundness
being
probably
she
kept
her
eyes
there
were
cunning
little
wrinkles
at
the
corners
of
them
in
spite
of
appearances
she
was
unwilling
to
present
any
outward
acknowledgment
of
the
march
of
time
her
hair
was
palpably
dyed
her
hat
was
jauntily
set
on
her
head
and
ornamented
with
a
gay
feather
she
walked
with
a
light
tripping
step
swinging
her
bag
and
holding
her
head
up
smartly
her
manner
like
her
dress
said
as
plainly
as
words
could
speak
no
matter
how
long
i
may
have
lived
i
mean
to
be
young
and
charming
to
the
end
of
my
to
alban
s
surprise
she
stopped
and
addressed
him
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
could
you
tell
me
if
i
am
in
the
right
road
to
miss
ladd
s
school
she
spoke
with
nervous
rapidity
of
articulation
and
with
a
singularly
unpleasant
smile
it
parted
her
thin
lips
just
widely
enough
to
show
her
suspiciously
beautiful
teeth
and
it
opened
her
keen
gray
eyes
in
the
strangest
manner
the
higher
lid
rose
so
as
to
disclose
for
a
moment
the
upper
part
of
the
eyeball
and
to
give
her
the
appearance
not
of
a
woman
bent
on
making
herself
agreeable
but
of
a
woman
staring
in
a
panic
of
terror
careless
to
conceal
the
unfavorable
impression
that
she
had
produced
on
him
alban
answered
roughly
straight
on
and
tried
to
pass
her
she
stopped
him
with
a
peremptory
gesture
i
have
treated
you
politely
she
said
and
how
do
you
treat
me
in
return
well
i
am
not
surprised
men
are
all
brutes
by
nature
and
you
are
a
man
straight
on
she
repeated
contemptuously
i
should
like
to
know
how
far
that
helps
a
person
in
a
strange
place
perhaps
you
know
no
more
where
miss
ladd
s
school
is
than
i
do
or
perhaps
you
don
t
care
to
take
the
trouble
of
addressing
me
just
what
i
should
have
expected
from
a
person
of
your
sex
alban
felt
the
reproof
she
had
appealed
to
his
most
sense
his
sense
of
humor
he
rather
enjoyed
seeing
his
own
prejudice
against
women
grotesquely
reflected
in
this
flighty
stranger
s
prejudice
against
men
as
the
best
excuse
for
himself
that
he
could
make
he
gave
her
all
the
information
that
she
could
possibly
want
then
tried
again
to
pass
on
and
again
in
vain
he
had
recovered
his
place
in
her
estimation
she
had
not
done
with
him
yet
you
know
all
about
the
way
there
she
said
i
wonder
whether
you
know
anything
about
the
school
no
change
in
her
voice
no
change
in
her
manner
betrayed
any
special
motive
for
putting
this
question
alban
was
on
the
point
of
suggesting
that
she
should
go
on
to
the
school
and
make
her
inquiries
there
when
he
happened
to
notice
her
eyes
she
had
hitherto
looked
him
straight
in
the
face
she
now
looked
down
on
the
road
it
was
a
trifling
change
in
all
probability
it
meant
nothing
and
yet
merely
because
it
was
a
change
it
roused
his
curiosity
i
ought
to
know
something
about
the
school
he
answered
i
am
one
of
the
then
you
re
just
the
man
i
want
may
i
ask
your
name
alban
thank
you
i
am
rook
i
presume
you
have
heard
of
sir
jervis
redwood
bless
my
soul
you
are
a
scholar
of
course
and
you
have
never
heard
of
one
of
your
own
trade
very
extraordinary
you
see
i
am
sir
jervis
s
housekeeper
and
i
am
sent
here
to
take
one
of
your
young
ladies
back
with
me
to
our
place
don
t
interrupt
me
don
t
be
a
brute
again
sir
jervis
is
not
of
a
communicative
disposition
at
least
not
to
me
a
man
that
explains
it
a
man
he
is
always
poring
over
his
books
and
writings
and
miss
redwood
at
her
great
age
is
in
bed
half
the
day
not
a
thing
do
i
know
about
this
new
inmate
of
ours
except
that
i
am
to
take
her
back
with
me
you
would
feel
some
curiosity
yourself
in
my
place
wouldn
t
you
now
do
tell
me
what
sort
of
girl
is
miss
emily
brown
the
name
that
he
was
perpetually
thinking
of
on
this
woman
s
lips
alban
looked
at
her
well
said
rook
am
i
to
have
no
answer
ah
you
want
leading
so
like
a
man
again
is
she
pretty
still
examining
the
housekeeper
with
mingled
feelings
of
interest
and
distrust
alban
answered
ungraciously
alban
again
said
so
much
about
herself
rook
remarked
about
her
family
now
she
shifted
her
bag
restlessly
from
one
hand
to
another
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
if
miss
emily
s
father
she
suddenly
corrected
herself
if
miss
emily
s
parents
are
living
i
don
t
you
mean
you
won
t
tell
i
mean
exactly
what
i
have
oh
it
doesn
t
matter
rook
rejoined
i
shall
find
out
at
the
school
the
first
turning
to
the
left
i
think
you
said
across
the
fields
he
was
too
deeply
interested
in
emily
to
let
the
housekeeper
go
without
putting
a
question
on
his
side
is
sir
jervis
redwood
one
of
miss
emily
s
old
friends
he
asked
he
what
put
that
into
your
head
he
has
never
even
seen
miss
emily
she
s
going
to
our
house
ah
the
women
are
getting
the
upper
hand
now
and
serve
the
men
right
i
say
she
s
going
to
our
house
to
be
sir
jervis
s
secretary
you
would
like
to
have
the
place
yourself
wouldn
t
you
you
would
like
to
keep
a
poor
girl
from
getting
her
own
living
oh
you
may
look
as
fierce
as
you
please
the
time
s
gone
by
when
a
man
could
frighten
i
like
her
christian
name
i
call
emily
a
nice
name
enough
but
brown
morris
you
and
i
are
not
cursed
with
such
a
contemptibly
common
name
as
that
brown
oh
lord
she
tossed
her
head
scornfully
and
walked
away
humming
a
tune
alban
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
the
effort
of
his
later
life
had
been
to
conceal
the
hopeless
passion
which
had
mastered
him
in
spite
of
himself
knowing
nothing
from
emily
who
at
once
pitied
and
avoided
him
of
her
family
circumstances
or
of
her
future
plans
he
had
shrunk
from
making
inquiries
of
others
in
the
fear
that
they
too
might
find
out
his
secret
and
that
their
contempt
might
be
added
to
the
contempt
which
he
felt
for
himself
in
this
position
and
with
these
obstacles
in
his
way
the
announcement
of
emily
s
proposed
journey
under
the
care
of
a
stranger
to
fill
an
employment
in
the
house
of
a
stranger
not
only
took
him
by
surprise
but
inspired
him
with
a
strong
feeling
of
distrust
he
looked
after
sir
jervis
redwood
s
flighty
housekeeper
completely
forgetting
the
purpose
which
had
brought
him
thus
far
on
the
way
to
his
lodgings
before
rook
was
out
of
sight
alban
morris
was
following
her
back
to
the
school
chapter
vii
coming
events
cast
their
shadows
miss
de
sor
and
miss
wyvil
were
still
sitting
together
under
the
trees
talking
of
the
murder
at
the
inn
and
is
that
really
all
you
can
tell
me
said
francine
that
is
all
cecilia
answered
is
there
no
love
in
it
none
that
i
know
it
s
the
most
uninteresting
murder
that
ever
was
committed
what
shall
we
do
with
ourselves
i
m
tired
of
being
here
in
the
garden
when
do
the
performances
in
the
schoolroom
begin
not
for
two
hours
francine
yawned
and
what
part
do
you
take
in
it
she
asked
no
part
my
dear
i
tried
once
only
to
sing
a
simple
little
song
when
i
found
myself
standing
before
all
the
company
and
saw
rows
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
waiting
for
me
to
begin
i
was
so
frightened
that
miss
ladd
had
to
make
an
apology
for
me
i
didn
t
get
over
it
for
the
rest
of
the
day
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
had
no
appetite
for
my
dinner
horrible
said
cecilia
shuddering
over
the
remembrance
of
it
i
do
assure
you
i
thought
i
was
going
to
perfectly
unimpressed
by
this
harrowing
narrative
francine
turned
her
head
lazily
toward
the
house
the
door
was
thrown
open
at
the
same
moment
a
lithe
little
person
rapidly
descended
the
steps
that
led
to
the
lawn
it
s
emily
come
back
again
said
francine
and
she
seems
to
be
rather
in
a
hurry
cecilia
remarked
francine
s
satirical
smile
showed
itself
for
a
moment
did
this
appearance
of
hurry
in
emily
s
movements
denote
impatience
to
resume
the
recital
of
the
she
had
no
book
in
her
hand
she
never
even
looked
toward
francine
sorrow
became
plainly
visible
in
her
face
as
she
approached
the
two
girls
cecilia
rose
in
alarm
she
had
been
the
first
person
to
whom
emily
had
confided
her
domestic
anxieties
bad
news
from
your
aunt
she
asked
no
my
dear
no
news
at
emily
put
her
arms
tenderly
round
her
friend
s
neck
the
time
has
come
cecilia
she
said
we
must
wish
each
other
is
rook
here
already
it
s
dear
who
are
going
emily
answered
sadly
they
have
sent
the
governess
to
fetch
you
miss
ladd
is
too
busy
in
the
schoolroom
to
see
her
and
she
has
told
me
all
about
it
don
t
be
alarmed
there
is
no
bad
news
from
home
your
plans
are
altered
that
s
altered
cecilia
repeated
in
what
way
in
a
very
agreeable
way
you
are
going
to
travel
your
father
wishes
you
to
be
in
london
in
time
for
the
evening
mail
to
cecilia
guessed
what
had
happened
my
sister
is
not
getting
well
she
said
and
the
doctors
are
sending
her
to
the
to
the
baths
at
moritz
emily
added
there
is
only
one
difficulty
in
the
way
and
you
can
remove
it
your
sister
has
the
good
old
governess
to
take
care
of
her
and
the
courier
to
relieve
her
of
all
trouble
on
the
journey
they
were
to
have
started
yesterday
you
know
how
fond
julia
is
of
you
at
the
last
moment
she
won
t
hear
of
going
away
unless
you
go
too
the
rooms
are
waiting
at
moritz
and
your
father
is
annoyed
the
governess
says
by
the
delay
that
has
taken
place
she
paused
cecilia
was
silent
surely
you
don
t
hesitate
emily
said
i
am
too
happy
to
go
wherever
julia
goes
cecilia
answered
warmly
i
was
thinking
of
you
her
tender
nature
shrinking
from
the
hard
necessities
of
life
shrank
from
the
prospect
of
parting
i
thought
we
were
to
have
had
some
hours
together
yet
she
said
why
are
we
hurried
in
this
way
there
is
no
second
train
to
london
from
our
station
till
late
in
the
there
is
the
express
emily
reminded
her
and
there
is
time
to
catch
it
if
you
drive
at
once
to
the
she
took
cecilia
s
hand
and
pressed
it
to
her
bosom
thank
you
again
and
again
dear
for
all
you
have
done
for
me
whether
we
meet
again
or
not
as
long
as
i
live
i
shall
love
you
don
t
cry
she
made
a
faint
attempt
to
resume
her
customary
gayety
for
cecilia
s
sake
try
to
be
as
as
i
am
think
of
your
sister
don
t
think
of
me
only
kiss
cecilia
s
tears
fell
fast
oh
my
love
i
am
so
anxious
about
you
i
am
so
afraid
that
you
will
not
be
happy
with
that
selfish
old
man
in
that
dreary
house
give
it
up
emily
i
have
got
plenty
of
money
for
both
of
us
come
abroad
with
me
why
not
you
always
got
on
well
with
julia
when
you
came
to
see
us
in
the
holidays
oh
my
darling
my
darling
what
shall
i
do
without
you
all
that
longed
for
love
in
emily
s
nature
had
clung
round
her
since
her
father
s
death
turning
deadly
pale
under
the
struggle
to
control
herself
she
made
the
effort
and
bore
the
pain
of
it
without
letting
a
cry
or
a
tear
escape
her
our
ways
in
life
lie
far
apart
she
said
gently
there
is
the
hope
of
meeting
again
dear
if
there
is
nothing
the
clasp
of
cecilia
s
arm
tightened
round
her
she
tried
to
release
herself
but
her
resolution
had
reached
its
limits
her
hands
dropped
trembling
she
could
still
try
to
speak
cheerfully
and
that
was
all
there
is
not
the
least
reason
cecilia
to
be
anxious
about
my
prospects
i
mean
to
be
sir
jervis
redwood
s
favorite
before
i
have
been
a
week
in
his
she
stopped
and
pointed
to
the
house
the
governess
was
approaching
them
one
more
kiss
darling
we
shall
not
forget
the
happy
hours
we
have
spent
together
we
shall
constantly
write
to
each
she
broke
down
at
last
oh
cecilia
cecilia
leave
me
for
god
s
sake
i
can
t
bear
it
any
longer
the
governess
parted
them
emily
dropped
into
the
chair
that
her
friend
had
left
even
her
hopeful
nature
sank
under
the
burden
of
life
at
that
moment
a
hard
voice
speaking
close
at
her
side
startled
her
would
you
rather
be
me
the
voice
asked
without
a
creature
to
care
for
you
emily
raised
her
head
francine
the
unnoticed
witness
of
the
parting
interview
was
standing
by
her
idly
picking
the
leaves
from
a
rose
which
had
dropped
out
of
cecilia
s
nosegay
had
she
felt
her
own
isolated
position
she
had
felt
it
resentfully
emily
looked
at
her
with
a
heart
softened
by
sorrow
there
was
no
answering
kindness
in
the
eyes
of
miss
de
sor
there
was
only
a
dogged
endurance
sad
to
see
in
a
creature
so
young
you
and
cecilia
are
going
to
write
to
each
other
she
said
i
suppose
there
is
some
comfort
in
that
when
i
left
the
island
they
were
glad
to
get
rid
of
me
they
said
telegraph
when
you
are
safe
at
miss
ladd
s
you
see
we
are
so
rich
the
expense
of
telegraphing
to
the
west
indies
is
nothing
to
us
besides
a
telegram
has
an
advantage
over
a
letter
it
doesn
t
take
long
to
read
i
daresay
i
shall
write
home
but
they
are
in
no
hurry
and
i
am
in
no
hurry
the
school
s
breaking
up
you
are
going
your
way
and
i
am
going
mine
and
who
cares
what
becomes
of
me
only
an
ugly
old
schoolmistress
who
is
paid
for
caring
i
wonder
why
i
am
saying
all
this
because
i
like
you
i
don
t
know
that
i
like
you
any
better
than
you
like
me
when
i
wanted
to
be
friends
with
you
you
treated
me
coolly
i
don
t
want
to
force
myself
on
you
i
don
t
particularly
care
about
you
may
i
write
to
you
from
brighton
under
all
this
bitterness
the
first
exhibition
of
francine
s
temper
at
its
worst
which
had
taken
place
since
she
joined
the
school
emily
saw
or
thought
she
saw
distress
that
was
too
proud
or
too
shy
to
show
itself
how
can
you
ask
the
question
she
answered
cordially
francine
was
incapable
of
meeting
the
sympathy
offered
to
her
even
half
way
never
mind
how
she
said
yes
or
no
is
all
i
want
from
oh
francine
francine
what
are
you
made
of
flesh
and
blood
or
stone
and
iron
write
to
me
of
course
and
i
will
write
back
thank
you
are
you
going
to
stay
here
under
the
trees
all
by
yourself
all
by
with
nothing
to
do
i
can
think
of
francine
eyed
her
with
steady
attention
for
a
moment
didn
t
you
tell
me
last
night
that
you
were
very
poor
she
asked
i
so
poor
that
you
are
obliged
to
earn
your
own
living
francine
looked
at
her
again
i
daresay
you
won
t
believe
me
she
said
i
wish
i
was
she
turned
away
irritably
and
walked
back
to
the
house
were
there
really
longings
for
kindness
and
love
under
the
surface
of
this
girl
s
perverse
nature
or
was
there
nothing
to
be
hoped
from
a
better
knowledge
of
her
in
place
of
tender
remembrances
of
cecilia
these
were
the
perplexing
and
unwelcome
thoughts
which
the
more
potent
personality
of
francine
forced
upon
emily
s
mind
she
rose
impatiently
and
looked
at
her
watch
when
would
it
be
her
turn
to
leave
the
school
and
begin
the
new
life
still
undecided
what
to
do
next
her
interest
was
excited
by
the
appearance
of
one
of
the
servants
on
the
lawn
the
woman
approached
her
and
presented
a
bearing
on
it
the
name
of
jervis
beneath
the
name
there
was
a
line
written
in
pencil
mrs
rook
to
wait
on
miss
emily
the
way
to
the
new
life
was
open
before
her
at
last
looking
again
at
the
commonplace
announcement
contained
in
the
line
of
writing
she
was
not
quite
satisfied
was
it
claiming
a
deference
toward
herself
to
which
she
was
not
entitled
to
expect
a
letter
either
from
sir
jervis
or
from
miss
redwood
giving
her
some
information
as
to
the
journey
which
she
was
about
to
undertake
and
expressing
with
some
little
politeness
the
wish
to
make
her
comfortable
in
her
future
home
at
any
rate
her
employer
had
done
her
one
service
he
had
reminded
her
that
her
station
in
life
was
not
what
it
had
been
in
the
days
when
her
father
was
living
and
when
her
aunt
was
in
affluent
circumstances
she
looked
up
from
the
card
the
servant
had
gone
alban
morris
was
waiting
at
a
little
distance
waiting
silently
until
she
noticed
him
chapter
viii
master
and
pupil
emily
s
impulse
was
to
avoid
the
for
the
second
time
the
moment
afterward
a
kinder
feeling
prevailed
the
farewell
interview
with
cecilia
had
left
influences
which
pleaded
for
alban
morris
it
was
the
day
of
parting
good
wishes
and
general
separations
he
had
only
perhaps
come
to
say
she
advanced
to
offer
her
hand
when
he
stopped
her
by
pointing
to
sir
jervis
redwood
s
card
may
i
say
a
word
miss
emily
about
that
woman
he
asked
do
you
mean
rook
yes
you
know
of
course
why
she
comes
here
she
comes
here
by
appointment
to
take
me
to
sir
jervis
redwood
s
house
are
you
acquainted
with
her
she
is
a
perfect
stranger
to
me
i
met
her
by
accident
on
her
way
here
if
rook
had
been
content
with
asking
me
to
direct
her
to
the
school
i
should
not
be
troubling
you
at
this
moment
but
she
forced
her
conversation
on
me
and
she
said
something
which
i
think
you
ought
to
know
have
you
heard
of
sir
jervis
redwood
s
housekeeper
before
i
have
only
heard
what
my
friend
miss
cecilia
wyvil
has
told
did
miss
cecilia
tell
you
that
rook
was
acquainted
with
your
father
or
with
any
members
of
your
family
certainly
not
alban
reflected
it
was
natural
enough
he
resumed
that
rook
should
feel
some
curiosity
about
you
what
reason
had
she
for
putting
a
question
to
me
about
your
father
and
putting
it
in
a
very
strange
manner
emily
s
interest
was
instantly
excited
she
led
the
way
back
to
the
seats
in
the
shade
tell
me
morris
exactly
what
the
woman
as
she
spoke
she
signed
to
him
to
be
seated
alban
observed
the
natural
grace
of
her
action
when
she
set
him
the
example
of
taking
a
chair
and
the
little
heightening
of
her
color
caused
by
anxiety
to
hear
what
he
had
still
to
tell
her
forgetting
the
restraint
that
he
had
hitherto
imposed
on
himself
he
enjoyed
the
luxury
of
silently
admiring
her
her
manner
betrayed
none
of
the
conscious
confusion
which
would
have
shown
itself
if
her
heart
had
been
secretly
inclined
toward
him
she
saw
the
man
looking
at
her
in
simple
perplexity
she
looked
at
the
man
are
you
hesitating
on
my
account
she
asked
did
rook
say
something
of
my
father
which
i
mustn
t
hear
no
no
nothing
of
the
sort
you
seem
to
be
her
innocent
indifference
tried
his
patience
sorely
his
memory
went
back
to
the
past
time
recalled
the
passion
of
his
youth
and
the
cruel
injury
inflicted
on
him
his
pride
was
roused
was
he
making
himself
ridiculous
the
vehement
throbbing
of
his
heart
almost
suffocated
him
and
there
she
sat
wondering
at
his
odd
behavior
even
this
girl
is
as
as
the
rest
of
her
sex
that
angry
thought
gave
him
back
his
he
made
his
excuses
with
the
easy
politeness
of
a
man
of
the
world
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
emily
i
was
considering
how
to
put
what
i
have
to
say
in
the
fewest
and
plainest
words
let
me
try
if
i
can
do
it
if
rook
had
merely
asked
me
whether
your
father
and
mother
were
living
i
should
have
attributed
the
question
to
the
commonplace
curiosity
of
a
gossiping
woman
and
have
thought
no
more
of
it
what
she
actually
did
say
was
this
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
if
miss
emily
s
father
there
she
checked
herself
and
suddenly
altered
the
question
in
this
way
if
miss
emily
s
are
living
i
may
be
making
mountains
out
of
molehills
but
i
thought
at
the
time
and
think
still
that
she
had
some
special
interest
in
inquiring
after
your
father
and
not
wishing
me
to
notice
it
for
reasons
of
her
own
changed
the
form
of
the
question
so
as
to
include
your
mother
does
this
strike
you
as
a
conclusion
whatever
it
may
be
emily
said
it
is
my
conclusion
too
how
did
you
answer
her
quite
easily
i
could
give
her
no
information
and
i
said
let
me
offer
you
the
information
morris
before
we
say
anything
more
i
have
lost
both
my
alban
s
momentary
outbreak
of
irritability
was
at
an
end
he
was
earnest
and
yet
gentle
again
he
forgave
her
for
not
understanding
how
dear
and
how
delightful
to
him
she
was
will
it
distress
you
he
said
if
i
ask
how
long
it
is
since
your
father
died
nearly
four
years
she
replied
he
was
the
most
generous
of
men
rook
s
interest
in
him
may
surely
have
been
a
grateful
interest
he
may
have
been
kind
to
her
in
past
years
and
she
may
remember
him
thankfully
don
t
you
think
so
alban
was
unable
to
agree
with
her
if
rook
s
interest
in
your
father
was
the
harmless
interest
that
you
have
suggested
he
said
why
should
she
have
checked
herself
in
that
unaccountable
manner
when
she
first
asked
me
if
he
was
living
the
more
i
think
of
it
now
the
less
sure
i
feel
that
she
knows
anything
at
all
of
your
family
history
it
may
help
me
to
decide
if
you
will
tell
me
at
what
time
the
death
of
your
mother
took
so
long
ago
emily
replied
that
i
can
t
even
remember
her
death
i
was
an
infant
at
the
and
yet
rook
asked
me
if
your
parents
were
living
one
of
two
things
alban
concluded
either
there
is
some
mystery
in
this
matter
which
we
can
not
hope
to
penetrate
at
present
or
rook
may
have
been
speaking
at
random
on
the
chance
of
discovering
whether
you
are
related
to
some
mr
brown
whom
she
once
besides
emily
added
it
s
only
fair
to
remember
what
a
common
family
name
mine
is
and
how
easily
people
may
make
mistakes
i
should
like
to
know
if
my
dear
lost
father
was
really
in
her
mind
when
she
spoke
to
you
do
you
think
i
could
find
it
out
if
rook
has
any
reasons
for
concealment
i
believe
you
would
have
no
chance
of
finding
it
out
unless
indeed
you
could
take
her
by
in
what
way
morris
only
one
way
occurs
to
me
just
now
he
said
do
you
happen
to
have
a
miniature
or
a
photograph
of
your
father
emily
held
out
a
handsome
locket
with
a
monogram
in
diamonds
attached
to
her
watch
chain
i
have
his
photograph
here
she
rejoined
given
to
me
by
my
dear
old
aunt
in
the
days
of
her
prosperity
shall
i
show
it
to
rook
yes
if
she
happens
by
good
luck
to
offer
you
an
impatient
to
try
the
experiment
emily
rose
as
he
spoke
i
mustn
t
keep
rook
waiting
she
said
alban
stopped
her
on
the
point
of
leaving
him
the
confusion
and
hesitation
which
she
had
already
noticed
began
to
show
themselves
in
his
manner
once
more
miss
emily
may
i
ask
you
a
favor
before
you
go
i
am
only
one
of
the
masters
employed
in
the
school
but
i
don
t
think
let
me
say
i
hope
i
am
not
guilty
of
presumption
if
i
offer
to
be
of
some
small
service
to
one
of
my
pupils
there
his
embarrassment
mastered
him
he
despised
himself
not
only
for
yielding
to
his
own
weakness
but
for
faltering
like
a
fool
in
the
expression
of
a
simple
request
the
next
words
died
away
on
his
lips
this
time
emily
understood
him
the
subtle
penetration
which
had
long
since
led
her
to
the
discovery
of
his
secret
overpowered
thus
far
by
the
absorbing
interest
of
the
moment
now
recovered
its
activity
in
an
instant
she
remembered
that
alban
s
motive
for
cautioning
her
in
her
coming
intercourse
with
rook
was
not
the
merely
friendly
motive
which
might
have
actuated
him
in
the
case
of
one
of
the
other
girls
at
the
same
time
her
quickness
of
apprehension
warned
her
not
to
risk
encouraging
this
persistent
lover
by
betraying
any
embarrassment
on
her
side
he
was
evidently
anxious
to
be
present
in
her
interests
at
the
interview
with
rook
why
not
could
he
reproach
her
with
raising
false
hope
if
she
accepted
his
services
under
circumstances
of
doubt
and
difficulty
which
he
had
himself
been
the
first
to
point
out
he
could
do
nothing
of
the
sort
without
waiting
until
he
had
recovered
himself
she
answered
him
to
all
appearances
as
composedly
as
if
he
had
spoken
to
her
in
the
plainest
terms
after
all
that
you
have
told
me
she
said
i
shall
indeed
feel
obliged
if
you
will
be
present
when
i
see
the
eager
brightening
of
his
eyes
the
flush
of
happiness
that
made
him
look
young
on
a
sudden
were
signs
not
to
be
mistaken
the
sooner
they
were
in
the
presence
of
a
third
person
emily
privately
concluded
the
better
it
might
be
for
both
of
them
she
led
the
way
rapidly
to
the
house
chapter
ix
rook
and
the
locket
as
mistress
of
a
prosperous
school
bearing
a
reputation
miss
ladd
prided
herself
on
the
liberality
of
her
household
arrangements
at
breakfast
and
dinner
not
only
the
solid
comforts
but
the
elegant
luxuries
of
the
table
were
set
before
the
young
ladies
other
schools
may
and
no
doubt
do
offer
to
pupils
the
affectionate
care
to
which
they
have
been
accustomed
under
the
parents
roof
miss
ladd
used
to
say
at
my
school
that
care
extends
to
their
meals
and
provides
them
with
a
which
i
flatter
myself
equals
the
most
successful
efforts
of
the
cooks
at
fathers
mothers
and
friends
when
they
paid
visits
to
this
excellent
lady
brought
away
with
them
the
most
gratifying
recollections
of
her
hospitality
the
men
in
particular
seldom
failed
to
recognize
in
their
hostess
the
rarest
virtue
that
a
single
lady
can
possess
the
virtue
of
putting
wine
on
the
table
which
may
be
gratefully
remembered
by
her
guests
the
next
morning
an
agreeable
surprise
awaited
rook
when
she
entered
the
house
of
bountiful
miss
ladd
luncheon
was
ready
for
sir
jervis
redwood
s
confidential
emissary
in
the
detained
at
the
final
rehearsals
of
music
and
recitation
miss
ladd
was
worthily
represented
by
cold
chicken
and
ham
a
fruit
tart
and
a
pint
decanter
of
generous
sherry
your
mistress
is
a
perfect
lady
rook
said
to
the
servant
with
a
burst
of
enthusiasm
i
can
carve
for
myself
thank
you
and
i
don
t
care
how
long
miss
emily
keeps
me
as
they
ascended
the
steps
leading
into
the
house
alban
asked
emily
if
he
might
look
again
at
her
locket
shall
i
open
it
for
you
she
suggested
no
i
only
want
to
look
at
the
outside
of
he
examined
the
side
on
which
the
monogram
appeared
inlaid
with
diamonds
an
inscription
was
engraved
beneath
may
i
read
it
he
said
certainly
the
inscription
ran
thus
in
loving
memory
of
my
father
died
september
can
you
arrange
the
locket
alban
asked
so
that
the
side
on
which
the
diamonds
appear
hangs
outward
she
understood
him
the
diamonds
might
attract
rook
s
notice
and
in
that
case
she
might
ask
to
see
the
locket
of
her
own
accord
you
are
beginning
to
be
of
use
to
me
already
emily
said
as
they
turned
into
the
corridor
which
led
to
the
they
found
sir
jervis
s
housekeeper
luxuriously
recumbent
in
the
easiest
chair
in
the
room
of
the
eatable
part
of
the
lunch
some
relics
were
yet
left
in
the
pint
decanter
of
sherry
not
a
drop
remained
the
genial
influence
of
the
wine
hastened
by
the
hot
weather
was
visible
in
rook
s
flushed
face
and
in
a
special
development
of
her
ugly
smile
her
widening
lips
stretched
to
new
lengths
and
the
white
upper
line
of
her
eyeballs
were
more
freely
and
horribly
visible
than
ever
and
this
is
the
dear
young
lady
she
said
lifting
her
hands
in
admiration
at
the
first
greetings
alban
perceived
that
the
impression
produced
was
in
emily
s
case
as
in
his
case
instantly
unfavorable
the
servant
came
in
to
clear
the
table
emily
stepped
aside
for
a
minute
to
give
some
directions
about
her
luggage
in
that
interval
rook
s
cunning
little
eyes
turned
on
alban
with
an
expression
of
malicious
scrutiny
you
were
walking
the
other
way
she
whispered
when
i
met
she
stopped
and
glanced
over
her
shoulder
at
emily
i
see
what
attraction
has
brought
you
back
to
the
school
steal
your
way
into
that
poor
little
fool
s
heart
and
then
make
her
miserable
for
the
rest
of
her
life
no
need
miss
to
hurry
she
said
shifting
the
polite
side
of
her
toward
emily
who
returned
at
the
moment
the
visits
of
the
trains
to
your
station
here
are
like
the
visits
of
the
angels
described
by
the
poet
few
and
far
please
excuse
the
quotation
you
wouldn
t
think
it
to
look
at
me
i
m
a
great
is
it
a
long
journey
to
sir
jervis
redwood
s
house
emily
asked
at
a
loss
what
else
to
say
to
a
woman
who
was
already
becoming
unendurable
to
her
rook
looked
at
the
journey
from
an
oppressively
cheerful
point
of
view
oh
miss
emily
you
shan
t
feel
the
time
hang
heavy
in
my
company
i
can
converse
on
a
variety
of
topics
and
if
there
is
one
thing
more
than
another
that
i
like
it
s
amusing
a
pretty
young
lady
you
think
me
a
strange
creature
don
t
you
it
s
only
my
high
spirits
nothing
strange
about
me
unless
it
s
my
queer
christian
name
you
look
a
little
dull
my
dear
shall
i
begin
amusing
you
before
we
are
on
the
railway
shall
i
tell
you
how
i
came
by
my
queer
name
thus
far
alban
had
controlled
himself
this
last
specimen
of
the
housekeeper
s
audacious
familiarity
reached
the
limits
of
his
endurance
we
don
t
care
to
know
how
you
came
by
your
name
he
said
rude
rook
remarked
composedly
but
nothing
surprises
me
coming
from
a
she
turned
to
emily
my
father
and
mother
were
a
wicked
married
couple
she
continued
before
i
was
born
they
got
religion
as
the
saying
is
at
a
methodist
meeting
in
a
field
when
i
came
into
the
world
i
don
t
know
how
you
feel
miss
i
protest
against
being
brought
into
the
world
without
asking
my
leave
first
my
mother
was
determined
to
dedicate
me
to
piety
before
i
was
out
of
my
long
clothes
what
name
do
you
suppose
she
had
me
christened
by
she
chose
it
or
made
it
herself
the
name
of
righteous
righteous
rook
was
there
ever
a
poor
baby
degraded
by
such
a
ridiculous
name
before
it
s
needless
to
say
when
i
write
letters
i
sign
rook
and
leave
people
to
think
it
s
rosamond
or
rosabelle
or
something
sweetly
pretty
of
that
kind
you
should
have
seen
my
husband
s
face
when
he
first
heard
that
his
sweetheart
s
name
was
righteous
he
was
on
the
point
of
kissing
me
and
he
stopped
i
daresay
he
felt
sick
perfectly
natural
under
the
alban
tried
to
stop
her
again
what
time
does
the
train
go
he
asked
emily
entreated
him
to
restrain
himself
by
a
look
rook
was
still
too
inveterately
amiable
to
take
offense
she
opened
her
briskly
and
placed
a
railway
guide
in
alban
s
hands
i
ve
heard
that
the
women
do
the
men
s
work
in
foreign
parts
she
said
but
this
is
england
and
i
am
an
englishwoman
find
out
when
the
train
goes
my
dear
sir
for
alban
at
once
consulted
the
guide
if
there
proved
to
be
no
immediate
need
of
starting
for
the
station
he
was
determined
that
emily
should
not
be
condemned
to
pass
the
interval
in
the
housekeeper
s
company
in
the
meantime
rook
was
as
eager
as
ever
to
show
her
dear
young
lady
what
an
amusing
companion
she
could
be
talking
of
husbands
she
resumed
don
t
make
the
mistake
my
dear
that
i
committed
beware
of
letting
anybody
persuade
you
to
marry
an
old
man
rook
is
old
enough
to
be
my
father
i
bear
with
him
of
course
i
bear
with
him
at
the
same
time
i
have
not
as
the
poet
says
passed
through
the
ordeal
my
spirit
i
have
long
since
ceased
to
believe
in
anything
of
the
sort
i
only
use
the
word
for
want
of
a
better
my
spirit
i
say
has
become
embittered
i
was
once
a
pious
young
woman
i
do
assure
you
i
was
nearly
as
good
as
my
name
don
t
let
me
shock
you
i
have
lost
faith
and
hope
i
have
become
what
s
the
last
new
name
for
a
oh
i
keep
up
with
the
times
thanks
to
old
miss
redwood
she
takes
in
the
newspapers
and
makes
me
read
them
to
her
what
the
new
name
something
ending
in
ic
bombastic
no
agnostic
that
s
it
i
have
become
an
agnostic
the
inevitable
result
of
marrying
an
old
man
if
there
s
any
blame
it
rests
on
my
there
s
more
than
an
hour
yet
before
the
train
starts
alban
interposed
i
am
sure
miss
emily
you
would
find
it
pleasanter
to
wait
in
the
not
at
all
a
bad
notion
rook
declared
here
s
a
man
who
can
make
himself
useful
for
once
let
s
go
into
the
she
rose
and
led
the
way
to
the
door
alban
seized
the
opportunity
of
whispering
to
emily
did
you
notice
the
empty
decanter
when
we
first
came
in
that
horrid
woman
is
emily
pointed
significantly
to
the
locket
don
t
let
her
go
the
garden
will
distract
her
attention
keep
her
near
me
rook
gayly
opened
the
door
take
me
to
the
she
said
i
believe
in
nothing
but
i
adore
rook
waited
at
the
door
with
her
eye
on
emily
what
do
say
miss
i
think
we
shall
be
more
comfortable
if
we
stay
where
we
whatever
pleases
you
my
dear
pleases
with
this
reply
the
compliant
housekeeper
as
amiable
as
ever
on
the
surface
returned
to
her
chair
would
she
notice
the
locket
as
she
sat
down
emily
turned
toward
the
window
so
as
to
let
the
light
fall
on
the
diamonds
no
rook
was
absorbed
at
the
moment
in
her
own
reflections
miss
emily
having
prevented
her
from
seeing
the
garden
she
was
maliciously
bent
on
disappointing
miss
emily
in
return
sir
jervis
s
secretary
being
young
took
a
hopeful
view
no
doubt
of
her
future
prospects
rook
decided
on
darkening
that
view
in
a
manner
peculiar
to
herself
you
will
naturally
feel
some
curiosity
about
your
new
home
she
began
and
i
haven
t
said
a
word
about
it
yet
how
very
thoughtless
of
me
inside
and
out
dear
miss
emily
our
house
is
just
a
little
dull
i
say
house
and
why
not
when
the
management
of
it
is
all
thrown
on
me
we
are
built
of
stone
and
we
are
much
too
long
and
are
not
half
high
enough
our
situation
is
on
the
coldest
side
of
the
county
away
in
the
west
we
are
close
to
the
cheviot
hills
and
if
you
fancy
there
is
anything
to
see
when
you
look
out
of
window
except
sheep
you
will
find
yourself
woefully
mistaken
as
for
walks
if
you
go
out
on
one
side
of
the
house
you
may
or
may
not
be
gored
by
cattle
on
the
other
side
if
the
darkness
overtakes
you
you
may
or
may
not
tumble
down
a
deserted
lead
mine
but
the
company
inside
the
house
makes
amends
for
it
all
rook
proceeded
enjoying
the
expression
of
dismay
which
was
beginning
to
show
itself
on
emily
s
face
plenty
of
excitement
for
you
my
dear
in
our
small
family
sir
jervis
will
introduce
you
to
plaster
casts
of
hideous
indian
idols
he
will
keep
you
writing
for
him
without
mercy
from
morning
to
night
and
when
he
does
let
you
go
old
miss
redwood
will
find
she
can
t
sleep
and
will
send
for
the
pretty
young
to
read
to
her
my
husband
i
am
sure
you
will
like
he
is
a
respectable
man
and
bears
the
highest
character
next
to
the
idols
he
s
the
most
hideous
object
in
the
house
if
you
are
good
enough
to
encourage
him
i
don
t
say
that
he
won
t
amuse
you
he
will
tell
you
for
instance
he
never
in
his
life
hated
any
human
being
as
he
hates
his
wife
by
the
way
i
must
not
forget
in
the
interests
of
truth
you
know
to
mention
one
drawback
that
does
exist
in
our
domestic
circle
one
of
these
days
we
shall
have
our
brains
blown
out
or
our
throats
cut
sir
jervis
s
mother
left
him
ten
thousand
pounds
worth
of
precious
stones
all
contained
in
a
little
cabinet
with
drawers
he
won
t
let
the
banker
take
care
of
his
jewels
he
won
t
sell
them
he
won
t
even
wear
one
of
the
rings
on
his
finger
or
one
of
the
pins
at
his
breast
he
keeps
his
cabinet
on
his
table
and
he
says
i
like
to
gloat
over
my
jewels
every
night
before
i
go
to
ten
thousand
pounds
worth
of
diamonds
rubies
emeralds
sapphires
and
what
not
at
the
mercy
of
the
first
robber
who
happens
to
hear
of
them
oh
my
dear
he
would
have
no
choice
i
do
assure
you
but
to
use
his
pistols
we
shouldn
t
quietly
submit
to
be
robbed
sir
jervis
inherits
the
spirit
of
his
ancestors
my
husband
has
the
temper
of
a
game
cock
i
myself
in
defense
of
the
property
of
my
employers
am
capable
of
becoming
a
perfect
fiend
and
we
none
of
us
understand
the
use
of
firearms
while
she
was
in
full
enjoyment
of
this
last
aggravation
of
the
horrors
of
the
prospect
emily
tried
another
change
of
position
and
this
time
with
success
greedy
admiration
suddenly
opened
rook
s
little
eyes
to
their
utmost
width
my
heart
alive
miss
what
do
i
see
at
your
how
they
sparkle
might
i
ask
for
a
closer
view
emily
s
fingers
trembled
but
she
succeeded
in
detaching
the
locket
from
the
chain
alban
handed
it
to
rook
she
began
by
admiring
the
diamonds
with
a
certain
reserve
nothing
like
so
large
as
sir
jervis
s
diamonds
but
choice
specimens
no
doubt
might
i
ask
what
the
value
she
stopped
the
inscription
had
attracted
her
notice
she
began
to
read
it
aloud
in
loving
memory
of
my
father
died
her
face
instantly
became
rigid
the
next
words
were
suspended
on
her
lips
alban
seized
the
chance
of
making
her
betray
herself
under
pretense
of
helping
her
perhaps
you
find
the
figures
not
easy
to
read
he
said
the
date
is
thirtieth
september
eighteen
hundred
and
nearly
four
years
not
a
word
not
a
movement
escaped
rook
she
held
the
locket
before
her
as
she
had
held
it
from
the
first
alban
looked
at
emily
her
eyes
were
riveted
on
the
housekeeper
she
was
barely
capable
of
preserving
the
appearance
of
composure
seeing
the
necessity
of
acting
for
her
he
at
once
said
the
words
which
she
was
unable
to
say
for
herself
perhaps
rook
you
would
like
to
look
at
the
portrait
he
suggested
shall
i
open
the
locket
for
you
without
speaking
without
looking
up
she
handed
the
locket
to
alban
he
opened
it
and
offered
it
to
her
she
neither
accepted
nor
refused
it
her
hands
remained
hanging
over
the
arms
of
the
chair
he
put
the
locket
on
her
lap
the
portrait
produced
no
marked
effect
on
rook
had
the
date
prepared
her
to
see
it
she
sat
looking
at
it
still
without
moving
still
without
saying
a
word
alban
had
no
mercy
on
her
that
is
the
portrait
of
miss
emily
s
father
he
said
does
it
represent
the
same
brown
whom
you
had
in
your
mind
when
you
asked
me
if
miss
emily
s
father
was
still
living
that
question
roused
her
she
looked
up
on
the
instant
she
answered
loudly
and
insolently
no
and
yet
alban
persisted
you
broke
down
in
reading
the
inscription
and
considering
what
talkative
woman
you
are
the
portrait
has
had
a
strange
effect
on
you
to
say
the
least
of
she
eyed
him
steadily
while
he
was
speaking
and
turned
to
emily
when
he
had
done
you
mentioned
the
heat
just
now
miss
the
heat
has
overcome
me
i
shall
soon
get
right
the
insolent
futility
of
that
excuse
irritated
emily
into
answering
her
you
will
get
right
again
perhaps
all
the
sooner
she
said
if
we
trouble
you
with
no
more
questions
and
leave
you
to
recover
by
the
first
change
of
expression
which
relaxed
the
iron
tensity
of
the
housekeeper
s
face
showed
itself
when
she
heard
that
reply
at
last
there
was
a
feeling
in
rook
which
openly
declared
itself
a
feeling
of
impatience
to
see
alban
and
emily
leave
the
room
they
left
her
without
a
word
more
chapter
x
guesses
at
the
truth
what
are
we
to
do
next
oh
morris
you
must
have
seen
all
sorts
of
people
in
your
time
you
know
human
nature
and
i
don
t
help
me
with
a
word
of
advice
emily
forgot
that
he
was
in
love
with
her
forgot
everything
but
the
effect
produced
by
the
locket
on
rook
and
the
vaguely
alarming
conclusion
to
which
it
pointed
in
the
fervor
of
her
anxiety
she
took
alban
s
arm
as
familiarly
as
if
he
had
been
her
brother
he
was
gentle
he
was
considerate
he
tried
earnestly
to
compose
her
we
can
do
nothing
to
any
good
purpose
he
said
unless
we
begin
by
thinking
quietly
pardon
me
for
saying
so
you
are
needlessly
exciting
there
was
a
reason
for
her
excitement
of
which
he
was
necessarily
ignorant
her
memory
of
the
night
interview
with
miss
jethro
had
inevitably
intensified
the
suspicion
inspired
by
the
conduct
of
rook
in
less
than
hours
emily
had
seen
two
women
shrinking
from
secret
remembrances
of
her
father
which
might
well
be
guilty
remembrances
innocently
excited
by
herself
how
had
they
injured
him
of
what
infamy
on
their
parts
did
his
beloved
and
stainless
memory
remind
them
who
could
fathom
the
mystery
of
it
what
does
it
mean
she
cried
looking
wildly
in
alban
s
compassionate
face
you
have
formed
some
idea
of
your
own
what
does
it
mean
come
and
sit
down
miss
emily
we
will
try
if
we
can
find
out
what
it
means
they
returned
to
the
shady
solitude
under
the
trees
away
in
front
of
the
house
the
distant
grating
of
carriage
wheels
told
of
the
arrival
of
miss
ladd
s
guests
and
of
the
speedy
beginning
of
the
ceremonies
of
the
day
we
must
help
each
other
alban
resumed
when
we
first
spoke
of
rook
you
mentioned
miss
cecilia
wyvil
as
a
person
who
knew
something
about
her
have
you
any
objection
to
tell
me
what
you
may
have
heard
in
that
way
in
complying
with
his
request
emily
necessarily
repeated
what
cecilia
had
told
francine
when
the
two
girls
had
met
that
morning
in
the
garden
alban
now
knew
how
emily
had
obtained
employment
as
sir
jervis
s
secretary
how
and
rook
had
been
previously
known
to
cecilia
s
father
as
respectable
people
keeping
an
inn
in
his
own
neighborhood
and
finally
how
they
had
been
obliged
to
begin
life
again
in
domestic
service
because
the
terrible
event
of
a
murder
had
given
the
inn
a
bad
name
and
had
driven
away
the
customers
on
whose
encouragement
their
business
depended
listening
in
silence
alban
remained
silent
when
emily
s
narrative
had
come
to
an
end
have
you
nothing
to
say
to
me
she
asked
i
am
thinking
over
what
i
have
just
heard
he
answered
emily
noticed
a
certain
formality
in
his
tone
and
manner
which
disagreeably
surprised
her
he
seemed
to
have
made
his
reply
as
a
mere
concession
to
politeness
while
he
was
thinking
of
something
else
which
really
interested
him
have
i
disappointed
you
in
any
way
she
asked
on
the
contrary
you
have
interested
me
i
want
to
be
quite
sure
that
i
remember
exactly
what
you
have
said
you
mentioned
i
think
that
your
friendship
with
miss
cecilia
wyvil
began
here
at
the
school
and
in
speaking
of
the
murder
at
the
village
inn
you
told
me
that
the
crime
was
committed
i
have
forgotten
how
long
ago
his
manner
still
suggested
that
he
was
idly
talking
about
what
she
had
told
him
while
some
more
important
subject
for
reflection
was
in
possession
of
his
mind
i
don
t
know
that
i
said
anything
about
the
time
that
had
passed
since
the
crime
was
committed
she
answered
sharply
what
does
the
murder
matter
to
i
think
cecilia
told
me
it
happened
about
four
years
since
excuse
me
for
noticing
it
morris
you
seem
to
have
some
interests
of
your
own
to
occupy
your
attention
why
couldn
t
you
say
so
plainly
when
we
came
out
here
i
should
not
have
asked
you
to
help
me
in
that
case
since
my
poor
father
s
death
i
have
been
used
to
fight
through
my
troubles
by
she
rose
and
looked
at
him
proudly
the
next
moment
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
in
spite
of
her
resistance
alban
took
her
hand
dear
miss
emily
he
said
you
distress
me
you
have
not
done
me
justice
your
interests
only
are
in
my
answering
her
in
those
terms
he
had
not
spoken
as
frankly
as
usual
he
had
only
told
her
a
part
of
the
truth
hearing
that
the
woman
whom
they
had
just
left
had
been
landlady
of
an
inn
and
that
a
murder
had
been
committed
under
her
roof
he
was
led
to
ask
himself
if
any
explanation
might
be
found
in
these
circumstances
of
the
otherwise
incomprehensible
effect
produced
on
rook
by
the
inscription
on
the
locket
in
the
pursuit
of
this
inquiry
there
had
arisen
in
his
mind
a
monstrous
suspicion
which
pointed
to
rook
it
impelled
him
to
ascertain
the
date
at
which
the
murder
had
been
committed
and
if
the
discovery
encouraged
further
investigation
to
find
out
next
the
manner
in
which
brown
had
died
thus
far
what
progress
had
he
made
he
had
discovered
that
the
date
of
brown
s
death
inscribed
on
the
locket
and
the
date
of
the
crime
committed
at
the
inn
approached
each
other
nearly
enough
to
justify
further
investigation
in
the
meantime
had
he
succeeded
in
keeping
his
object
concealed
from
emily
he
had
perfectly
succeeded
hearing
him
declare
that
her
interests
only
had
occupied
his
mind
the
poor
girl
innocently
entreated
him
to
forgive
her
little
outbreak
of
temper
if
you
have
any
more
questions
to
ask
me
morris
pray
go
on
i
promise
never
to
think
unjustly
of
you
he
went
on
with
an
uneasy
conscience
for
it
seemed
cruel
to
deceive
her
even
in
the
interests
of
truth
but
still
he
went
on
suppose
we
assume
that
this
woman
had
injured
your
father
in
some
way
he
said
am
i
right
in
believing
that
it
was
in
his
character
to
forgive
injuries
entirely
in
that
case
his
death
may
have
left
rook
in
a
position
to
be
called
to
account
by
those
who
owe
a
duty
to
his
memory
i
mean
the
surviving
members
of
his
there
are
but
two
of
us
morris
my
aunt
and
there
are
his
my
aunt
is
his
only
your
father
s
sister
i
presume
he
may
have
left
instructions
with
her
which
might
be
of
the
greatest
use
to
i
will
write
and
find
out
emily
replied
i
had
already
planned
to
consult
my
aunt
she
added
thinking
again
of
miss
jethro
if
your
aunt
has
not
received
any
positive
instructions
alban
continued
she
may
remember
some
allusion
to
rook
on
your
father
s
part
at
the
time
of
his
last
illness
emily
stopped
him
you
don
t
know
how
my
dear
father
died
she
said
he
was
struck
down
apparently
in
perfect
health
by
disease
of
the
struck
down
in
his
own
house
yes
in
his
own
those
words
closed
alban
s
lips
the
investigation
so
carefully
and
so
delicately
conducted
had
failed
to
serve
any
useful
purpose
he
had
now
ascertained
the
manner
of
brown
s
death
and
the
place
of
brown
s
death
and
he
was
as
far
from
confirming
his
suspicions
of
rook
as
ever
chapter
xi
the
s
confession
is
there
nothing
else
you
can
suggest
emily
asked
nothing
at
if
my
aunt
fails
us
have
we
no
other
hope
i
have
hope
in
rook
alban
answered
i
see
i
surprise
you
but
i
really
mean
what
i
say
sir
jervis
s
housekeeper
is
an
excitable
woman
and
she
is
fond
of
wine
there
is
always
a
weak
side
in
the
character
of
such
a
person
as
that
if
we
wait
for
our
chance
and
turn
it
to
the
right
use
when
it
comes
we
may
yet
succeed
in
making
her
betray
emily
listened
to
him
in
bewilderment
you
talk
as
if
i
was
sure
of
your
help
in
the
future
she
said
have
you
forgotten
that
i
leave
school
never
to
return
in
half
an
hour
more
i
shall
be
condemned
to
a
long
journey
in
the
company
of
that
horrible
creature
with
a
life
to
look
forward
to
in
the
same
house
with
her
among
strangers
a
miserable
prospect
and
a
hard
trial
of
a
girl
s
courage
is
it
not
morris
you
will
at
least
have
one
person
miss
emily
who
will
try
with
all
his
heart
and
soul
to
encourage
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
said
alban
quietly
that
the
midsummer
vacation
begins
and
that
the
is
going
to
spend
his
holidays
in
the
emily
jumped
up
from
her
chair
you
she
exclaimed
are
going
to
northumberland
with
me
why
not
alban
asked
the
railway
is
open
to
all
travelers
alike
if
they
have
money
enough
to
buy
a
mr
morris
what
you
be
thinking
of
indeed
indeed
i
am
not
ungrateful
i
know
you
mean
kindly
you
are
a
good
generous
man
but
do
remember
how
completely
a
girl
in
my
position
is
at
the
mercy
of
appearances
you
traveling
in
the
same
carriage
with
me
and
that
woman
putting
her
own
vile
interpretation
on
it
and
degrading
me
in
sir
jervis
redwood
s
estimation
on
the
day
when
i
enter
his
house
oh
it
s
worse
than
thoughtless
it
s
madness
downright
you
are
quite
right
alban
gravely
agreed
it
madness
i
lost
whatever
little
reason
i
once
possessed
miss
emily
on
the
day
when
i
first
met
you
out
walking
with
the
young
ladies
of
the
emily
turned
away
in
significant
silence
alban
followed
her
you
promised
just
now
he
said
never
to
think
unjustly
of
me
again
i
respect
and
admire
you
far
too
sincerely
to
take
a
base
advantage
of
this
occasion
the
only
occasion
on
which
i
have
been
permitted
to
speak
with
you
alone
wait
a
little
before
you
condemn
a
man
whom
you
don
t
understand
i
will
say
nothing
to
annoy
you
i
only
ask
leave
to
explain
myself
will
you
take
your
chair
again
she
returned
unwillingly
to
her
seat
it
can
only
end
she
thought
sadly
in
my
disappointing
him
i
have
had
the
worst
possible
opinion
of
women
for
years
past
alban
resumed
and
the
only
reason
i
can
give
for
it
condemns
me
out
of
my
own
mouth
i
have
been
infamously
treated
by
one
woman
and
my
wounded
has
meanly
revenged
itself
by
reviling
the
whole
sex
wait
a
little
miss
emily
my
fault
has
received
its
fit
punishment
i
have
been
thoroughly
humiliated
and
have
done
mr
morris
take
no
offense
pray
where
no
offense
is
meant
some
few
years
since
it
was
the
great
misfortune
of
my
life
to
meet
with
a
jilt
you
know
what
i
mean
she
was
my
equal
by
birth
i
am
a
younger
son
of
a
country
squire
and
my
superior
in
rank
i
can
honestly
tell
you
that
i
was
fool
enough
to
love
her
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
she
never
allowed
me
to
doubt
i
may
say
this
without
conceit
remembering
the
miserable
end
of
it
that
my
feeling
for
her
was
returned
her
father
and
mother
excellent
people
approved
of
the
contemplated
marriage
she
accepted
my
presents
she
allowed
all
the
customary
preparations
for
a
wedding
to
proceed
to
completion
she
had
not
even
mercy
enough
or
shame
enough
to
prevent
me
from
publicly
degrading
myself
by
waiting
for
her
at
the
altar
in
the
presence
of
a
large
congregation
the
minutes
passed
and
no
bride
appeared
the
clergyman
waiting
like
me
was
requested
to
return
to
the
vestry
i
was
invited
to
follow
him
you
foresee
the
end
of
the
story
of
course
she
had
run
away
with
another
man
but
can
you
guess
who
the
man
was
her
groom
emily
s
face
reddened
with
indignation
she
suffered
for
it
oh
morris
surely
she
suffered
for
it
not
at
all
she
had
money
enough
to
reward
the
groom
for
marrying
her
and
she
let
herself
down
easily
to
her
husband
s
level
it
was
a
suitable
marriage
in
every
respect
when
i
last
heard
of
them
they
were
regularly
in
the
habit
of
getting
drunk
together
i
am
afraid
i
have
disgusted
you
we
will
drop
the
subject
and
resume
my
precious
autobiography
at
a
later
date
one
showery
day
in
the
autumn
of
last
year
you
young
ladies
went
out
with
miss
ladd
for
a
walk
when
you
were
all
trotting
back
again
under
your
umbrellas
did
you
in
particular
notice
an
fellow
standing
in
the
road
and
getting
a
good
look
at
you
on
the
high
footpath
above
him
emily
smiled
in
spite
of
herself
i
don
t
remember
it
she
said
you
wore
a
brown
jacket
which
fitted
you
as
if
you
had
been
born
in
it
and
you
had
the
smartest
little
straw
hat
i
ever
saw
on
a
woman
s
head
it
was
the
first
time
i
ever
noticed
such
things
i
think
i
could
paint
a
portrait
of
the
boots
you
wore
mud
included
from
memory
alone
that
was
the
impression
you
produced
on
me
after
believing
honestly
believing
that
love
was
one
of
the
lost
illusions
of
my
life
after
feeling
honestly
feeling
that
i
would
as
soon
look
at
the
devil
as
look
at
a
woman
there
was
the
state
of
mind
to
which
retribution
had
reduced
me
using
for
his
instrument
miss
emily
brown
oh
don
t
be
afraid
of
what
i
may
say
next
in
your
presence
and
out
of
your
presence
i
am
man
enough
to
be
ashamed
of
my
own
folly
i
am
resisting
your
influence
over
me
at
this
moment
with
the
strongest
of
all
resolutions
the
resolution
of
despair
let
s
look
at
the
humorous
side
of
the
story
again
what
do
you
think
i
did
when
the
regiment
of
young
ladies
had
passed
by
me
emily
declined
to
guess
i
followed
you
back
to
the
school
and
on
pretense
of
having
a
daughter
to
educate
i
got
one
of
miss
ladd
s
prospectuses
from
the
porter
at
the
lodge
gate
i
was
in
your
neighborhood
you
must
know
on
a
sketching
tour
i
went
back
to
my
inn
and
seriously
considered
what
had
happened
to
me
the
result
of
my
cogitations
was
that
i
went
abroad
only
for
a
change
not
at
all
because
i
was
trying
to
weaken
the
impression
you
had
produced
on
me
after
a
while
i
returned
to
england
only
because
i
was
tired
of
traveling
not
at
all
because
your
influence
drew
me
back
another
interval
passed
and
luck
turned
my
way
for
a
wonder
the
s
place
became
vacant
here
miss
ladd
advertised
i
produced
my
testimonials
and
took
the
situation
only
because
the
salary
was
a
welcome
certainty
to
a
poor
man
not
at
all
because
the
new
position
brought
me
into
personal
association
with
miss
emily
brown
do
you
begin
to
see
why
i
have
troubled
you
with
all
this
talk
about
myself
apply
the
contemptible
system
of
which
my
confession
has
revealed
to
that
holiday
arrangement
for
a
tour
in
the
north
which
has
astonished
and
annoyed
you
i
am
going
to
travel
this
afternoon
by
your
train
only
because
i
feel
an
intelligent
longing
to
see
the
northernmost
county
of
england
not
at
all
because
i
won
t
let
you
trust
yourself
alone
with
rook
not
at
all
because
i
won
t
leave
you
to
enter
sir
jervis
redwood
s
service
without
a
friend
within
reach
in
case
you
want
him
mad
oh
yes
perfectly
mad
but
tell
me
this
what
do
all
sensible
people
do
when
they
find
themselves
in
the
company
of
a
lunatic
they
humor
him
let
me
take
your
ticket
and
see
your
luggage
labeled
i
only
ask
leave
to
be
your
traveling
servant
if
you
are
proud
i
shall
like
you
all
the
better
if
you
are
pay
me
wages
and
keep
me
in
my
proper
place
in
that
some
girls
addressed
with
this
reckless
intermingling
of
jest
and
earnest
would
have
felt
confused
and
some
would
have
felt
flattered
with
a
resolution
which
never
passed
the
limits
of
modesty
and
refinement
emily
met
alban
morris
on
his
own
ground
you
have
said
you
respect
me
she
began
i
am
going
to
prove
that
i
believe
you
the
least
i
can
do
is
not
to
misinterpret
you
on
my
side
am
i
to
understand
morris
you
won
t
think
the
worse
of
me
i
hope
if
i
speak
plainly
am
i
to
understand
that
you
are
in
love
with
me
yes
miss
emily
if
you
he
had
answered
with
the
quaint
gravity
which
was
peculiar
to
him
but
he
was
already
conscious
of
a
sense
of
discouragement
her
composure
was
a
bad
sign
from
his
point
of
view
my
time
will
come
i
daresay
she
proceeded
at
present
i
know
nothing
of
love
by
experience
i
only
know
what
some
of
my
schoolfellows
talk
about
in
secret
judging
by
what
they
tell
me
a
girl
blushes
when
her
lover
pleads
with
her
to
favor
his
addresses
am
i
blushing
must
i
speak
plainly
too
alban
asked
if
you
have
no
objection
she
answered
as
composedly
as
if
she
had
been
addressing
her
grandfather
then
miss
emily
i
must
say
you
are
not
she
went
on
another
token
of
love
as
i
am
informed
is
to
tremble
am
i
trembling
am
i
too
confused
to
look
at
you
do
i
walk
away
with
dignity
and
then
stop
and
steal
a
timid
glance
at
my
lover
over
my
shoulder
i
wish
you
did
a
plain
answer
morris
yes
or
no
of
in
one
last
word
do
i
give
you
any
sort
of
encouragement
to
try
again
in
one
last
word
i
have
made
a
fool
of
myself
and
you
have
taken
the
kindest
possible
way
of
telling
me
this
time
she
made
no
attempt
to
reply
in
his
own
tone
the
gayety
of
her
manner
disappeared
she
was
in
earnest
truly
sadly
in
earnest
when
she
said
her
next
words
is
it
not
best
in
your
own
interests
that
we
should
bid
each
other
she
asked
in
the
time
to
come
when
you
only
remember
how
kind
you
once
were
to
me
we
may
look
forward
to
meeting
again
after
all
that
you
have
suffered
so
bitterly
and
so
undeservedly
don
t
pray
don
t
make
me
feel
that
another
woman
has
behaved
cruelly
to
you
and
that
i
so
grieved
to
distress
you
am
that
heartless
creature
never
in
her
life
had
she
been
so
irresistibly
charming
as
she
was
at
that
moment
her
sweet
nature
showed
all
its
innocent
pity
for
him
in
her
face
he
saw
it
he
felt
it
he
was
not
unworthy
of
it
in
silence
he
lifted
her
hand
to
his
lips
he
turned
pale
as
he
kissed
it
say
that
you
agree
with
me
she
pleaded
i
obey
as
he
answered
he
pointed
to
the
lawn
at
their
feet
look
he
said
at
that
dead
leaf
which
the
air
is
wafting
over
the
grass
is
it
possible
that
such
sympathy
as
you
feel
for
me
such
love
as
i
feel
for
you
can
waste
wither
and
fall
to
the
ground
like
that
leaf
i
leave
you
emily
with
the
firm
conviction
that
there
is
a
time
of
fulfillment
to
come
in
our
two
lives
happen
what
may
in
the
interval
i
trust
the
the
words
had
barely
passed
his
lips
when
the
voice
of
one
of
the
servants
reached
them
from
the
house
miss
emily
are
you
in
the
garden
emily
stepped
out
into
the
sunshine
the
servant
hurried
to
meet
her
and
placed
a
telegram
in
her
hand
she
looked
at
it
with
a
sudden
misgiving
in
her
small
experience
a
telegram
was
associated
with
the
communication
of
bad
news
she
conquered
her
hesitation
opened
it
read
it
the
color
left
her
face
she
shuddered
the
telegram
dropped
on
the
grass
read
it
she
said
faintly
as
alban
picked
it
up
he
read
these
words
come
to
london
directly
miss
letitia
is
dangerously
your
aunt
he
asked
yes
my
book
the
second
in
london
chapter
xii
ellmother
the
metropolis
of
great
britain
is
in
certain
respects
like
no
other
metropolis
on
the
face
of
the
earth
in
the
population
that
throngs
the
streets
the
extremes
of
wealth
and
the
extremes
of
poverty
meet
as
they
meet
nowhere
else
in
the
streets
themselves
the
glory
and
the
shame
of
architecture
the
mansion
and
the
hovel
are
neighbors
in
situation
as
they
are
neighbors
nowhere
else
london
in
its
social
aspect
is
the
city
of
contrasts
toward
the
close
of
evening
emily
left
the
railway
terminus
for
the
place
of
residence
in
which
loss
of
fortune
had
compelled
her
aunt
to
take
refuge
as
she
approached
her
destination
the
cab
passed
by
merely
crossing
a
road
from
a
spacious
and
beautiful
park
with
its
surrounding
houses
topped
by
statues
and
cupolas
to
a
row
of
cottages
hard
by
a
stinking
ditch
miscalled
a
canal
the
city
of
contrasts
north
and
south
east
and
west
the
city
of
social
contrasts
emily
stopped
the
cab
before
the
garden
gate
of
a
cottage
at
the
further
end
of
the
row
the
bell
was
answered
by
the
one
servant
now
in
her
aunt
s
employ
miss
letitia
s
maid
personally
this
good
creature
was
one
of
the
women
whose
appearance
suggests
that
nature
intended
to
make
men
of
them
and
altered
her
mind
at
the
last
moment
miss
letitia
s
maid
was
tall
and
gaunt
and
awkward
the
first
impression
produced
by
her
face
was
an
impression
of
bones
they
rose
high
on
her
forehead
they
projected
on
her
cheeks
and
they
reached
their
boldest
development
in
her
jaws
in
the
cavernous
eyes
of
this
unfortunate
person
rigid
obstinacy
and
rigid
goodness
looked
out
together
with
equal
severity
on
all
her
alike
her
mistress
whom
she
had
served
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
and
more
called
her
she
accepted
this
cruelly
appropriate
as
a
mark
of
affectionate
familiarity
which
honored
a
servant
no
other
person
was
allowed
to
take
liberties
with
her
to
every
one
but
her
mistress
she
was
known
as
ellmother
how
is
my
aunt
emily
asked
why
have
i
not
heard
of
her
illness
before
because
she
s
too
fond
of
you
to
let
you
be
distressed
about
her
don
t
tell
emily
those
were
her
orders
as
long
as
she
kept
her
kept
her
senses
good
heavens
what
do
you
mean
fever
that
s
what
i
i
must
see
her
directly
i
am
not
afraid
of
there
s
no
infection
to
be
afraid
of
but
you
mustn
t
see
her
for
all
i
insist
on
seeing
miss
emily
i
am
disappointing
you
for
your
own
good
don
t
you
know
me
well
enough
to
trust
me
by
this
time
i
do
trust
then
leave
my
mistress
to
me
and
go
and
make
yourself
comfortable
in
your
own
emily
s
answer
was
a
positive
refusal
ellmother
driven
to
her
last
resources
raised
a
new
obstacle
it
s
not
to
be
done
i
tell
you
how
can
you
see
miss
letitia
when
she
can
t
bear
the
light
in
her
room
do
you
know
what
color
her
eyes
are
red
poor
soul
red
as
a
boiled
with
every
word
the
woman
uttered
emily
s
perplexity
and
distress
increased
you
told
me
my
aunt
s
illness
was
fever
she
said
and
now
you
speak
of
some
complaint
in
her
eyes
stand
out
of
the
way
if
you
please
and
let
me
go
to
ellmother
still
keeping
her
place
looked
through
the
open
door
here
s
the
doctor
she
announced
it
seems
i
can
t
satisfy
you
ask
him
what
s
the
matter
come
in
she
threw
open
the
door
of
the
parlor
and
introduced
emily
this
is
the
mistress
s
niece
sir
please
try
if
can
keep
her
quiet
i
can
she
placed
chairs
with
the
hospitable
politeness
of
the
old
school
and
returned
to
her
post
at
miss
letitia
s
bedside
doctor
allday
was
an
elderly
man
with
a
cool
manner
and
a
ruddy
complexion
thoroughly
acclimatized
to
the
atmosphere
of
pain
and
grief
in
which
it
was
his
destiny
to
live
he
spoke
to
emily
without
any
undue
familiarity
as
if
he
had
been
accustomed
to
see
her
for
the
greater
part
of
her
life
that
s
a
curious
woman
he
said
when
ellmother
closed
the
door
the
most
headstrong
person
i
think
i
ever
met
with
but
devoted
to
her
mistress
and
making
allowance
for
her
awkwardness
not
a
bad
nurse
i
am
afraid
i
can
t
give
you
an
encouraging
report
of
your
aunt
the
rheumatic
fever
aggravated
by
the
situation
of
this
house
built
on
clay
you
know
and
close
to
stagnant
water
has
been
latterly
complicated
by
is
that
a
bad
sign
sir
the
worst
possible
sign
it
shows
that
the
disease
has
affected
the
heart
yes
she
is
suffering
from
inflammation
of
the
eyes
but
that
is
an
unimportant
symptom
we
can
keep
the
pain
under
by
means
of
cooling
lotions
and
a
dark
room
i
ve
often
heard
her
speak
of
you
especially
since
the
illness
assumed
a
serious
character
what
did
you
say
will
she
know
you
when
you
go
into
her
room
this
is
about
the
time
when
the
delirium
usually
sets
in
i
ll
see
if
there
s
a
quiet
he
opened
the
door
and
came
back
again
by
the
way
he
resumed
i
ought
perhaps
to
explain
how
it
was
that
i
took
the
liberty
of
sending
you
that
telegram
ellmother
refused
to
inform
you
of
her
mistress
s
serious
illness
that
circumstance
according
to
my
view
of
it
laid
the
responsibility
on
the
doctor
s
shoulders
the
form
taken
by
your
aunt
s
delirium
i
mean
the
apparent
tendency
of
the
words
that
escape
her
in
that
state
seems
to
excite
some
incomprehensible
feeling
in
the
mind
of
her
crabbed
servant
she
wouldn
t
even
let
go
into
the
bedroom
if
she
could
possibly
help
it
did
ellmother
give
you
a
warm
welcome
when
you
came
here
far
from
it
my
arrival
seemed
to
annoy
ah
just
what
i
expected
these
faithful
old
servants
always
end
by
presuming
on
their
fidelity
did
you
ever
hear
what
a
witty
poet
i
forget
his
name
he
lived
to
be
ninety
said
of
the
man
who
had
been
his
valet
for
more
than
half
a
century
for
thirty
years
he
was
the
best
of
servants
and
for
thirty
years
he
has
been
the
hardest
of
quite
true
i
might
say
the
same
of
my
housekeeper
rather
a
good
story
isn
t
it
the
story
was
completely
thrown
away
on
emily
but
one
subject
interested
her
now
my
poor
aunt
has
always
been
fond
of
me
she
said
perhaps
she
might
know
me
when
she
recognizes
nobody
not
very
likely
the
doctor
answered
but
there
s
no
laying
down
any
rule
in
cases
of
this
kind
i
have
sometimes
observed
that
circumstances
which
have
produced
a
strong
impression
on
patients
when
they
are
in
a
state
of
health
give
a
certain
direction
to
the
wandering
of
their
minds
when
they
are
in
a
state
of
fever
you
will
say
i
am
not
a
circumstance
i
don
t
see
how
this
encourages
me
to
hope
and
you
will
be
quite
right
instead
of
talking
of
my
medical
experience
i
shall
do
better
to
look
at
miss
letitia
and
let
you
know
the
result
you
have
got
other
relations
i
suppose
no
very
distressing
very
who
has
not
suffered
as
emily
suffered
when
she
was
left
alone
are
there
not
moments
if
we
dare
to
confess
the
truth
when
poor
humanity
loses
its
hold
on
the
consolations
of
religion
and
the
hope
of
immortality
and
feels
the
cruelty
of
creation
that
bids
us
live
on
the
condition
that
we
die
and
leads
the
first
warm
beginnings
of
love
with
merciless
certainty
to
the
cold
conclusion
of
the
grave
she
s
quiet
for
the
time
being
allday
announced
on
his
return
remember
please
that
she
can
t
see
you
in
the
inflamed
state
of
her
eyes
and
don
t
disturb
the
the
sooner
you
go
to
her
the
better
perhaps
if
you
have
anything
to
say
which
depends
on
her
recognizing
your
voice
i
ll
call
morning
very
distressing
he
repeated
taking
his
hat
and
making
his
bow
very
emily
crossed
the
narrow
little
passage
which
separated
the
two
rooms
and
opened
the
door
ellmother
met
her
on
the
threshold
no
said
the
obstinate
old
servant
you
can
t
come
the
faint
voice
of
miss
letitia
made
itself
heard
calling
ellmother
by
her
familiar
bony
who
is
it
never
who
is
it
miss
emily
if
you
must
oh
poor
dear
why
does
she
come
here
who
told
her
i
was
ill
the
doctor
told
don
t
come
in
emily
it
will
only
distress
you
and
it
will
do
me
no
good
god
bless
you
my
love
don
t
come
there
said
ellmother
do
you
hear
that
go
back
to
the
thus
far
the
hard
necessity
of
controlling
herself
had
kept
emily
silent
she
was
now
able
to
speak
without
tears
remember
the
old
times
aunt
she
pleaded
gently
don
t
keep
me
out
of
your
room
when
i
have
come
here
to
nurse
you
i
m
her
nurse
go
back
to
the
ellmother
repeated
true
love
lasts
while
life
lasts
the
dying
woman
relented
bony
bony
i
can
t
be
unkind
to
emily
let
her
ellmother
still
insisted
on
having
her
way
you
re
contradicting
your
own
orders
she
said
to
her
mistress
you
don
t
know
how
soon
you
may
begin
wandering
in
your
mind
again
think
miss
letitia
this
remonstrance
was
received
in
silence
ellmother
s
great
gaunt
figure
still
blocked
up
the
doorway
if
you
force
me
to
it
emily
said
quietly
i
must
go
to
the
doctor
and
ask
him
to
do
you
mean
that
ellmother
said
quietly
on
her
side
i
do
mean
it
was
the
answer
the
old
servant
suddenly
submitted
with
a
look
which
took
emily
by
surprise
she
had
expected
to
see
anger
the
face
that
now
confronted
her
was
a
face
subdued
by
sorrow
and
fear
i
wash
my
hands
of
it
ellmother
said
go
in
and
take
the
chapter
xiii
miss
letitia
emily
entered
the
room
the
door
was
immediately
closed
on
her
from
the
outer
side
ellmother
s
heavy
steps
were
heard
retreating
along
the
passage
then
the
banging
of
the
door
that
led
into
the
kitchen
shook
the
cottage
then
there
was
silence
the
dim
light
of
a
lamp
hidden
away
in
a
corner
and
screened
by
a
dingy
green
shade
just
revealed
the
bed
and
the
table
near
it
bearing
and
glasses
the
only
objects
on
the
were
a
clock
that
had
been
stopped
in
mercy
to
the
sufferer
s
irritable
nerves
and
an
open
case
containing
a
machine
for
pouring
drops
into
the
eyes
the
smell
of
fumigating
pastilles
hung
heavily
on
the
air
to
emily
s
excited
imagination
the
silence
was
like
the
silence
of
death
she
approached
the
bed
trembling
won
t
you
speak
to
me
aunt
is
that
you
emily
who
let
you
come
in
you
said
i
might
come
in
dear
are
you
thirsty
i
see
some
lemonade
on
the
table
shall
i
give
it
to
you
no
if
you
open
the
you
let
in
the
light
my
poor
eyes
why
are
you
here
my
dear
why
are
you
not
at
the
school
it
s
aunt
besides
i
have
left
school
for
left
school
miss
letitia
s
memory
made
an
effort
as
she
repeated
those
words
you
were
going
somewhere
when
you
left
school
she
said
and
cecilia
wyvil
had
something
to
do
with
it
oh
my
love
how
cruel
of
you
to
go
away
to
a
stranger
when
you
might
live
here
with
me
she
paused
her
sense
of
what
she
had
herself
just
said
began
to
grow
confused
what
stranger
she
asked
abruptly
was
it
a
man
what
name
oh
my
mind
has
death
got
hold
of
my
mind
before
my
body
hush
hush
i
ll
tell
you
the
name
sir
jervis
i
don
t
know
him
i
don
t
want
to
know
him
do
you
think
he
means
to
send
for
you
perhaps
he
sent
for
you
i
won
t
allow
it
you
shan
t
go
don
t
excite
yourself
dear
i
have
refused
to
go
i
mean
to
stay
here
with
the
fevered
brain
held
to
its
last
idea
he
sent
for
you
she
said
again
louder
than
before
emily
replied
once
more
in
terms
carefully
chosen
with
the
one
purpose
of
pacifying
her
the
attempt
proved
to
be
useless
and
worse
it
seemed
to
make
her
suspicious
i
won
t
be
deceived
she
said
i
mean
to
know
all
about
it
he
did
send
for
you
whom
did
he
send
his
what
name
the
tone
in
which
she
put
the
question
told
of
excitement
that
was
rising
to
its
climax
don
t
you
know
that
i
m
curious
about
names
she
burst
out
why
do
you
provoke
me
who
is
it
nobody
you
know
or
need
care
about
dear
aunt
instantly
on
the
utterance
of
that
name
there
followed
an
unexpected
result
silence
ensued
emily
waited
hesitated
advanced
to
part
the
curtains
and
look
in
at
her
aunt
she
was
stopped
by
a
dreadful
sound
of
laughter
the
cheerless
laughter
that
is
heard
among
the
mad
it
suddenly
ended
in
a
dreary
sigh
afraid
to
look
in
she
spoke
hardly
knowing
what
she
said
is
there
anything
you
wish
for
shall
i
call
miss
letitia
s
voice
interrupted
her
dull
low
rapidly
muttering
it
was
unlike
shockingly
unlike
the
familiar
voice
of
her
aunt
it
said
strange
words
mrs
rook
what
does
rook
matter
or
her
husband
either
bony
bony
you
re
frightened
about
nothing
where
s
the
danger
of
those
two
people
turning
up
do
you
know
how
many
miles
away
the
village
is
oh
you
fool
a
hundred
miles
and
more
never
mind
the
coroner
the
coroner
must
keep
in
his
own
district
and
the
jury
too
a
risky
deception
i
call
it
a
pious
fraud
and
i
have
a
tender
conscience
and
a
cultivated
mind
the
newspaper
how
is

to
find
its
way
to
her
i
should
like
to
know
you
poor
old
bony
upon
my
word

do
me
good

the
cheerless
laughter
broke
out
again
and
died
away
again
drearily
in
a
sigh
accustomed
to
decide
rapidly
in
the
ordinary
emergencies
of
her
life
emily
felt
herself
painfully
embarrassed
by
the
position
in
which
she
was
now
placed
after
what
she
had
already
heard
could
she
reconcile
it
to
her
sense
of
duty
to
her
aunt
to
remain
any
longer
in
the
room
in
the
hopeless
of
delirium
miss
letitia
had
revealed
some
act
of
concealment
committed
in
her
past
life
and
confided
to
her
faithful
old
servant
under
these
circumstances
had
emily
made
any
discoveries
which
convicted
her
of
taking
a
base
advantage
of
her
position
at
the
bedside
most
assuredly
not
the
nature
of
the
act
of
concealment
the
causes
that
had
led
to
it
the
person
or
persons
affected
by
it
these
were
mysteries
which
left
her
entirely
in
the
dark
she
had
found
out
that
her
aunt
was
acquainted
with
rook
and
that
was
literally
all
she
knew
blameless
so
far
in
the
line
of
conduct
that
she
had
pursued
might
she
still
remain
in
the
on
this
distinct
understanding
with
herself
that
she
would
instantly
return
to
the
if
she
heard
anything
which
could
suggest
a
doubt
of
miss
letitia
s
claim
to
her
affection
and
respect
after
some
hesitation
she
decided
on
leaving
it
to
her
conscience
to
answer
that
question
does
conscience
ever
say
no
when
inclination
says
yes
emily
s
conscience
sided
with
her
reluctance
to
leave
her
aunt
throughout
the
time
occupied
by
these
reflections
the
silence
had
remained
unbroken
emily
began
to
feel
uneasy
she
timidly
put
her
hand
through
the
curtains
and
took
miss
letitia
s
hand
the
contact
with
the
burning
skin
startled
her
she
turned
away
to
the
door
to
call
the
servant
when
the
sound
of
her
aunt
s
voice
hurried
her
back
to
the
bed
are
you
there
bony
the
voice
asked
was
her
mind
getting
clear
again
emily
tried
the
experiment
of
making
a
plain
reply
your
niece
is
with
you
she
said
shall
i
call
the
servant
miss
letitia
s
mind
was
still
far
away
from
emily
and
from
the
present
time
the
servant
she
repeated
all
the
servants
but
you
bony
have
been
sent
away
london
s
the
place
for
us
no
gossiping
servants
and
no
curious
neighbors
in
london
bury
the
horrid
truth
in
london
ah
you
may
well
say
i
look
anxious
and
wretched
i
hate
deception
and
yet
it
must
be
done
why
do
you
waste
time
in
talking
why
don
t
you
find
out
where
the
vile
woman
lives
only
let
me
get
at
her
and
i
ll
make
sara
ashamed
of
emily
s
heart
beat
fast
when
she
heard
the
woman
s
name
sara
as
she
and
her
knew
was
the
baptismal
name
of
miss
jethro
had
her
aunt
alluded
to
the
disgraced
teacher
or
to
some
other
woman
she
waited
eagerly
to
hear
more
there
was
nothing
to
be
heard
at
this
most
interesting
moment
the
silence
remained
undisturbed
in
the
fervor
of
her
anxiety
to
set
her
doubts
at
rest
emily
s
faith
in
her
own
good
resolutions
began
to
waver
the
temptation
to
say
something
which
might
set
her
aunt
talking
again
was
too
strong
to
be
resisted
if
she
remained
at
the
bedside
despairing
of
herself
she
rose
and
turned
to
the
door
in
the
moment
that
passed
while
she
crossed
the
room
the
very
words
occurred
to
her
that
would
suit
her
purpose
her
cheeks
were
hot
with
shame
she
hesitated
she
looked
back
at
the
bed
the
words
passed
her
lips
sara
is
only
one
of
the
woman
s
names
she
said
do
you
like
her
other
name
the
tones
broke
out
again
instantly
but
not
in
answer
to
emily
the
sound
of
a
voice
had
encouraged
miss
letitia
to
pursue
her
own
confused
train
of
thought
and
had
stimulated
the
capacity
of
speech
to
exert
itself
once
more
no
no
he
s
too
cunning
for
you
and
too
cunning
for
me
he
doesn
t
leave
letters
about
he
destroys
them
all
did
i
say
he
was
too
cunning
for
us
it
s
false
we
are
too
cunning
for
him
who
found
the
morsels
of
his
letter
in
the
basket
who
stuck
them
together
ah
know
don
t
read
it
bony
dear
miss
jethro
don
t
read
it
again
miss
jethro
in
his
letter
and
sara
when
he
talks
to
himself
in
the
garden
oh
who
would
have
believed
it
of
him
if
we
hadn
t
seen
and
heard
it
ourselves
there
was
no
more
doubt
now
but
who
was
the
man
so
bitterly
and
so
regretfully
alluded
to
no
this
time
emily
held
firmly
by
the
resolution
which
bound
her
to
respect
the
helpless
position
of
her
aunt
the
speediest
way
of
summoning
ellmother
would
be
to
ring
the
bell
as
she
touched
the
handle
a
faint
cry
of
suffering
from
the
bed
called
her
back
oh
so
thirsty
murmured
the
failing
voice
so
thirsty
she
parted
the
curtains
the
shrouded
lamplight
just
showed
her
the
green
shade
over
miss
letitia
s
eyes
the
hollow
cheeks
below
it
the
arms
laid
helplessly
on
the
oh
aunt
don
t
you
know
my
voice
don
t
you
know
emily
let
me
kiss
you
dear
useless
to
plead
with
her
useless
to
kiss
her
she
only
reiterated
the
words
so
thirsty
so
thirsty
emily
raised
the
poor
tortured
body
with
a
patient
caution
which
spared
it
pain
and
put
the
glass
to
her
aunt
s
lips
she
drank
the
lemonade
to
the
last
drop
refreshed
for
the
moment
she
spoke
again
spoke
to
the
visionary
servant
of
her
delirious
fancy
while
she
rested
in
emily
s
arms
for
god
s
sake
take
care
how
you
answer
if
she
questions
you
if
knew
what
know
are
men
ever
ashamed
ha
the
vile
woman
the
vile
woman
her
voice
sinking
gradually
dropped
to
a
whisper
the
next
few
words
that
escaped
her
were
muttered
inarticulately
little
by
little
the
false
energy
of
fever
was
wearing
itself
out
she
lay
silent
and
still
to
look
at
her
now
was
to
look
at
the
image
of
death
once
more
emily
kissed
her
closed
the
curtains
and
rang
the
bell
ellmother
failed
to
appear
emily
left
the
room
to
call
her
arrived
at
the
top
of
the
kitchen
stairs
she
noted
a
slight
change
the
door
below
which
she
had
heard
banged
on
first
entering
her
aunt
s
room
now
stood
open
she
called
to
ellmother
a
strange
voice
answered
her
its
accent
was
soft
and
courteous
presenting
the
strongest
imaginable
contrast
to
the
harsh
tones
of
miss
letitia
s
crabbed
old
maid
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
miss
the
person
making
this
polite
inquiry
appeared
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
a
plump
and
comely
woman
of
middle
age
she
looked
up
at
the
young
lady
with
a
pleasant
smile
i
beg
your
pardon
emily
said
i
had
no
intention
of
disturbing
you
i
called
to
the
stranger
advanced
a
little
way
up
the
stairs
and
answered
mrs
ellmother
is
not
do
you
expect
her
back
soon
excuse
me
miss
i
don
t
expect
her
back
at
do
you
mean
to
say
that
she
has
left
the
house
yes
miss
she
has
left
the
chapter
xiv
mosey
emily
s
first
act
after
the
discovery
of
ellmother
s
incomprehensible
disappearance
was
to
invite
the
new
servant
to
follow
her
into
the
can
you
explain
this
she
began
no
may
i
ask
if
you
have
come
here
by
ellmother
s
invitation
by
ellmother
s
can
you
tell
me
how
she
came
to
make
the
request
with
pleasure
miss
perhaps
as
you
find
me
here
a
stranger
to
yourself
in
place
of
the
customary
servant
i
ought
to
begin
by
giving
you
a
and
perhaps
if
you
will
be
so
kind
by
mentioning
your
name
emily
added
thank
you
for
reminding
me
miss
my
name
is
elizabeth
mosey
i
am
well
known
to
the
gentleman
who
attends
miss
letitia
allday
will
speak
to
my
character
and
also
to
my
experience
as
a
nurse
if
it
would
be
in
any
way
satisfactory
to
give
you
a
second
reference
quite
needless
permit
me
to
thank
you
again
miss
i
was
at
home
this
evening
when
ellmother
called
at
my
lodgings
says
she
i
have
come
here
elizabeth
to
ask
a
favor
of
you
for
old
friendship
s
says
i
my
dear
pray
command
me
whatever
it
may
if
this
seems
rather
a
hasty
answer
to
make
before
i
knew
what
the
favor
was
might
i
ask
you
to
bear
in
mind
that
ellmother
put
it
to
me
for
old
friendship
s
sake
alluding
to
my
late
husband
and
to
the
business
which
we
carried
on
at
that
time
through
no
fault
of
ours
we
got
into
difficulties
persons
whom
we
had
trusted
proved
unworthy
not
to
trouble
you
further
i
may
say
at
once
we
should
have
been
ruined
if
our
old
friend
ellmother
had
not
come
forward
and
trusted
us
with
the
savings
of
her
lifetime
the
money
was
all
paid
back
again
before
my
husband
s
death
but
i
don
t
consider
and
i
think
you
won
t
consider
that
the
obligation
was
paid
back
too
prudent
or
not
prudent
there
is
nothing
ellmother
can
ask
of
me
that
i
am
not
willing
to
do
if
i
have
put
myself
in
an
awkward
situation
and
i
don
t
deny
that
it
looks
so
this
is
the
only
excuse
miss
that
i
can
make
for
my
mosey
was
too
fluent
and
too
fond
of
hearing
the
sound
of
her
own
eminently
persuasive
voice
making
allowance
for
these
little
drawbacks
the
impression
that
she
produced
was
decidedly
favorable
and
however
rashly
she
might
have
acted
her
motive
was
beyond
reproach
having
said
some
kind
words
to
this
effect
emily
led
her
back
to
the
main
interest
of
her
narrative
did
ellmother
give
no
reason
for
leaving
my
aunt
at
such
a
time
as
this
she
asked
the
very
words
i
said
to
her
and
what
did
she
say
by
way
of
reply
she
burst
out
crying
a
thing
i
have
never
known
her
to
do
before
in
an
experience
of
twenty
and
she
really
asked
you
to
take
her
place
here
at
a
moment
s
notice
that
was
just
what
she
did
mosey
answered
i
had
no
need
to
tell
her
i
was
astonished
my
lips
spoke
for
me
no
doubt
she
s
a
hard
woman
in
speech
and
manner
i
admit
but
there
s
more
feeling
in
her
than
you
would
suppose
if
you
are
the
good
friend
i
take
you
for
she
says
don
t
ask
me
for
reasons
i
am
doing
what
is
forced
on
me
and
doing
it
with
a
heavy
in
my
place
miss
would
you
have
insisted
on
her
explaining
herself
after
that
the
one
thing
i
naturally
wanted
to
know
was
if
i
could
speak
to
some
lady
in
the
position
of
mistress
here
before
i
ventured
to
intrude
ellmother
understood
that
it
was
her
duty
to
help
me
in
this
particular
your
poor
aunt
being
out
of
the
question
she
mentioned
how
did
she
speak
of
me
in
an
angry
way
no
indeed
quite
the
contrary
she
says
you
will
find
miss
emily
at
the
cottage
she
is
miss
letitia
s
niece
everybody
likes
her
and
everybody
is
she
really
said
that
those
were
her
words
and
what
is
more
she
gave
me
a
message
for
you
at
parting
if
miss
emily
is
surprised
that
was
how
she
put
it
give
her
my
duty
and
good
wishes
and
tell
her
to
remember
what
i
said
when
she
took
my
place
at
her
aunt
s
i
don
t
presume
to
inquire
what
this
means
said
mosey
respectfully
ready
to
hear
what
it
meant
if
emily
would
only
be
so
good
as
to
tell
her
i
deliver
the
message
miss
as
it
was
delivered
to
me
after
which
ellmother
went
her
way
and
i
went
do
you
know
where
she
went
no
have
you
nothing
more
to
tell
me
nothing
more
except
that
she
gave
me
my
directions
of
course
about
the
nursing
i
took
them
down
in
writing
and
you
will
find
them
in
their
proper
place
with
the
prescriptions
and
the
acting
at
once
on
this
hint
emily
led
the
way
to
her
aunt
s
room
miss
letitia
was
silent
when
the
new
nurse
softly
parted
the
curtains
looked
in
and
drew
them
together
again
consulting
her
watch
mosey
compared
her
written
directions
with
the
on
the
table
and
set
one
apart
to
be
used
at
the
appointed
time
nothing
so
far
to
alarm
us
she
whispered
you
look
sadly
pale
and
tired
miss
might
i
advise
you
to
rest
a
little
if
there
is
any
change
mosey
either
for
the
better
or
the
worse
of
course
you
will
let
me
know
certainly
emily
returned
to
the
not
to
rest
after
all
that
she
had
heard
but
to
think
amid
much
that
was
unintelligible
certain
plain
conclusions
presented
themselves
to
her
mind
after
what
the
doctor
had
already
said
to
emily
on
the
subject
of
delirium
generally
ellmother
s
proceedings
became
intelligible
they
proved
that
she
knew
by
experience
the
perilous
course
taken
by
her
mistress
s
wandering
thoughts
when
they
expressed
themselves
in
words
this
explained
the
concealment
of
miss
letitia
s
illness
from
her
niece
as
well
as
the
reiterated
efforts
of
the
old
servant
to
prevent
emily
from
entering
the
bedroom
but
the
event
which
had
just
happened
that
is
to
say
ellmother
s
sudden
departure
from
the
cottage
was
not
only
of
serious
importance
in
itself
but
pointed
to
a
startling
conclusion
the
faithful
maid
had
left
the
mistress
whom
she
had
loved
and
served
sinking
under
a
fatal
illness
and
had
put
another
woman
in
her
place
careless
of
what
that
woman
might
discover
by
listening
at
the
bedside
rather
than
confront
emily
after
she
had
been
within
hearing
of
her
aunt
while
the
brain
of
the
suffering
woman
was
deranged
by
fever
there
was
the
state
of
the
case
in
plain
words
in
what
frame
of
mind
had
ellmother
adopted
this
desperate
course
of
action
to
use
her
own
expression
she
had
deserted
miss
letitia
with
a
heavy
to
judge
by
her
own
language
addressed
to
mosey
she
had
left
emily
to
the
mercy
of
a
stranger
animated
nevertheless
by
sincere
feelings
of
attachment
and
respect
that
her
fears
had
taken
for
granted
suspicion
which
emily
had
not
felt
and
discoveries
which
emily
had
as
yet
not
made
in
no
way
modified
the
serious
nature
of
the
inference
which
her
conduct
justified
the
disclosure
which
this
woman
dreaded
who
could
doubt
it
now
directly
threatened
emily
s
peace
of
mind
there
was
no
disguising
it
the
innocent
niece
was
associated
with
an
act
of
deception
which
had
been
until
that
day
the
undetected
secret
of
the
aunt
and
the
aunt
s
maid
in
this
conclusion
and
in
this
only
was
to
be
found
the
rational
explanation
of
ellmother
s
choice
placed
between
the
alternatives
of
submitting
to
discovery
by
emily
or
of
leaving
the
house
poor
miss
letitia
s
stood
near
the
window
of
the
shrinking
from
the
further
pursuit
of
thoughts
which
might
end
in
disposing
her
mind
to
distrust
of
her
dying
aunt
emily
looked
round
in
search
of
some
employment
sufficiently
interesting
to
absorb
her
attention
the
reminded
her
that
she
owed
a
letter
to
cecilia
that
helpful
friend
had
surely
the
first
claim
to
know
why
she
had
failed
to
keep
her
engagement
with
sir
jervis
redwood
after
mentioning
the
telegram
which
had
followed
rook
s
arrival
at
the
school
emily
s
letter
proceeded
in
these
terms
as
soon
as
i
had
in
some
degree
recovered
myself
i
informed
rook
of
my
aunt
s
serious
illness
although
she
carefully
confined
herself
to
commonplace
expressions
of
sympathy
i
could
see
that
it
was
equally
a
relief
to
both
of
us
to
feel
that
we
were
prevented
from
being
traveling
companions
don
t
suppose
that
i
have
taken
a
capricious
dislike
to
rook
or
that
you
are
in
any
way
to
blame
for
the
unfavorable
impression
which
she
has
produced
on
me
i
will
make
this
plain
when
we
meet
in
the
meanwhile
i
need
only
tell
you
that
i
gave
her
a
letter
of
explanation
to
present
to
sir
jervis
redwood
i
also
informed
him
of
my
address
in
london
adding
a
request
that
he
would
forward
your
letter
in
case
you
have
written
to
me
before
you
receive
these
lines

morris
accompanied
me
to
the
and
arranged
with
the
guard
to
take
special
care
of
me
on
the
journey
to
london
we
used
to
think
him
rather
a
heartless
man
we
were
quite
wrong
i
don
t
know
what
his
plans
are
for
spending
the
summer
holidays
go
where
he
may
i
remember
his
kindness
my
best
wishes
go
with
him
my
dear
i
must
not
sadden
your
enjoyment
of
your
pleasant
visit
to
the
engadine
by
writing
at
any
length
of
the
sorrow
that
i
am
suffering
you
know
how
i
love
my
aunt
and
how
gratefully
i
have
always
felt
her
motherly
goodness
to
me
the
doctor
does
not
conceal
the
truth
at
her
age
there
is
no
hope
my
father
s
relation
my
one
dearest
friend
is
dying
no
i
must
not
forget
that
i
have
another
friend
i
must
find
some
comfort
in
thinking
of
i
do
so
long
in
my
solitude
for
a
letter
from
my
dear
cecilia
nobody
comes
to
see
me
when
i
most
want
sympathy
i
am
a
stranger
in
this
vast
city
the
members
of
my
mother
s
family
are
settled
in
australia
they
have
not
even
written
to
me
in
all
the
long
years
that
have
passed
since
her
death
you
remember
how
cheerfully
i
used
to
look
forward
to
my
new
life
on
leaving
school
my
darling
while
i
can
see
your
sweet
face
in
my
thoughts
i
don
t
despair
dark
as
it
looks
now
of
the
future
that
is
before
emily
had
closed
and
addressed
her
letter
and
was
just
rising
from
her
chair
when
she
heard
the
voice
of
the
new
nurse
at
the
door
chapter
xv
emily
may
i
say
a
word
mosey
inquired
she
entered
the
room
pale
and
trembling
seeing
that
ominous
change
emily
dropped
back
into
her
chair
dead
she
said
faintly
mosey
looked
at
her
in
vacant
surprise
i
wish
to
say
miss
that
your
aunt
has
frightened
even
that
vague
allusion
was
enough
for
emily
you
need
say
no
more
she
replied
i
know
but
too
well
how
my
aunt
s
mind
is
affected
by
the
confused
and
frightened
as
she
was
mosey
still
found
relief
in
her
customary
flow
of
words
many
and
many
a
person
have
i
nursed
in
fever
she
announced
many
and
many
a
person
have
i
heard
say
strange
things
never
yet
miss
in
all
my
experience
don
t
tell
me
of
it
emily
interposed
oh
but
i
tell
you
in
your
own
interests
miss
emily
in
your
own
interests
i
won
t
be
inhuman
enough
to
leave
you
alone
in
the
house
but
if
this
delirium
goes
on
i
must
ask
you
to
get
another
nurse
shocking
suspicions
are
lying
in
wait
for
me
in
that
bedroom
as
it
were
i
can
t
resist
them
as
i
ought
if
i
go
back
again
and
hear
your
aunt
saying
what
she
has
been
saying
for
the
last
half
hour
and
more
ellmother
has
expected
impossibilities
of
me
and
ellmother
must
take
the
consequences
i
don
t
say
she
didn
t
warn
me
speaking
you
will
please
to
understand
in
the
strictest
confidence
elizabeth
she
says
you
know
how
wildly
people
talk
in
miss
letitia
s
present
condition
pay
no
heed
to
it
she
says
let
it
go
in
at
one
ear
and
out
at
the
other
she
says
if
miss
emily
asks
questions
you
know
nothing
about
it
if
she
s
frightened
you
know
nothing
about
it
if
she
bursts
into
fits
of
crying
that
are
dreadful
to
see
pity
her
poor
thing
but
take
no
all
very
well
and
sounds
like
speaking
out
doesn
t
it
nothing
of
the
sort
ellmother
warns
me
to
expect
this
that
and
the
other
but
there
is
one
horrid
thing
which
i
heard
mind
over
and
over
again
at
your
aunt
s
bedside
that
she
does
prepare
me
for
and
that
horrid
thing
is
murder
at
that
last
word
mosey
dropped
her
voice
to
a
whisper
and
waited
to
see
what
effect
she
had
produced
sorely
tried
already
by
the
cruel
perplexities
of
her
position
emily
s
courage
failed
to
resist
the
first
sensation
of
horror
aroused
in
her
by
the
climax
of
the
nurse
s
hysterical
narrative
encouraged
by
her
silence
mosey
went
on
she
lifted
one
hand
with
theatrical
solemnity
and
luxuriously
terrified
herself
with
her
own
horrors
an
inn
miss
emily
a
lonely
inn
somewhere
in
the
country
and
a
comfortless
room
at
the
inn
with
a
makeshift
bed
at
one
end
of
it
and
a
makeshift
bed
at
the
other
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
that
was
how
your
aunt
put
it
she
spoke
of
two
men
next
two
men
asleep
you
understand
in
the
two
beds
i
think
she
called
them
gentlemen
but
i
can
t
be
sure
and
i
wouldn
t
deceive
you
you
know
i
wouldn
t
deceive
you
for
the
world
miss
letitia
muttered
and
mumbled
poor
soul
i
own
i
was
getting
tired
of
listening
when
she
burst
out
plain
again
in
that
one
horrid
word
oh
miss
don
t
be
impatient
don
t
interrupt
me
emily
did
interrupt
nevertheless
in
some
degree
at
least
she
had
recovered
herself
no
more
of
it
she
said
i
won
t
hear
a
word
but
mosey
was
too
resolutely
bent
on
asserting
her
own
importance
by
making
the
most
of
the
alarm
that
she
had
suffered
to
be
repressed
by
any
ordinary
method
of
remonstrance
without
paying
the
slightest
attention
to
what
emily
had
said
she
went
on
again
more
loudly
and
more
excitably
than
ever
listen
miss
listen
the
dreadful
part
of
it
is
to
come
you
haven
t
heard
about
the
two
gentlemen
yet
one
of
them
was
murdered
what
do
you
think
of
that
and
the
other
i
heard
your
aunt
say
it
in
so
many
words
committed
the
crime
did
miss
letitia
fancy
she
was
addressing
a
lot
of
people
when
were
nursing
her
she
called
out
like
a
person
making
public
proclamation
when
i
was
in
her
room
whoever
you
are
good
people
she
says
a
hundred
pounds
reward
if
you
find
the
runaway
murderer
search
everywhere
for
a
poor
weak
womanish
creature
with
rings
on
his
little
white
hands
there
s
nothing
about
him
like
a
man
except
his
voice
a
fine
round
voice
you
ll
know
him
my
friends
the
wretch
the
monster
you
ll
know
him
by
his
that
was
how
she
put
it
i
tell
you
again
that
was
how
she
put
it
did
you
hear
her
scream
ah
my
dear
young
lady
so
much
the
better
for
you
o
the
horrid
murder
she
says
hush
it
up
i
ll
take
my
bible
oath
before
the
magistrate
cried
mosey
starting
out
of
her
chair
your
aunt
said
hush
it
up
emily
crossed
the
room
the
energy
of
her
character
was
roused
at
last
she
seized
the
foolish
woman
by
the
shoulders
forced
her
back
in
the
chair
and
looked
her
straight
in
the
face
without
uttering
a
word
for
the
moment
mosey
was
petrified
she
had
fully
expected
having
reached
the
end
of
her
terrible
story
to
find
emily
at
her
feet
entreating
her
not
to
carry
out
her
intention
of
leaving
the
cottage
the
next
morning
and
she
had
determined
after
her
sense
of
her
own
importance
had
been
sufficiently
flattered
to
grant
the
prayer
of
the
helpless
young
lady
those
were
her
anticipations
and
how
had
they
been
fulfilled
she
had
been
treated
like
a
mad
woman
in
a
state
of
revolt
how
dare
you
assault
me
she
asked
piteously
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
god
knows
i
meant
you
are
not
the
first
person
emily
answered
quietly
releasing
her
who
has
done
wrong
with
the
best
i
did
my
duty
miss
when
i
told
you
what
your
aunt
you
forgot
your
duty
when
you
listened
to
what
my
aunt
allow
me
to
explain
no
not
a
word
more
on
subject
shall
pass
between
us
remain
here
if
you
please
i
have
something
to
suggest
in
your
own
interests
wait
and
compose
the
purpose
which
had
taken
a
foremost
place
in
emily
s
mind
rested
on
the
firm
foundation
of
her
love
and
pity
for
her
aunt
now
that
she
had
regained
the
power
to
think
she
felt
a
hateful
doubt
pressed
on
her
by
mosey
s
disclosures
having
taken
for
granted
that
there
was
a
foundation
in
truth
for
what
she
herself
had
heard
in
her
aunt
s
room
could
she
reasonably
resist
the
conclusion
that
there
must
be
a
foundation
in
truth
for
what
mosey
had
heard
under
similar
circumstances
there
was
but
one
way
of
escaping
from
this
dilemma
and
emily
deliberately
took
it
she
turned
her
back
on
her
own
convictions
and
persuaded
herself
that
she
had
been
in
the
wrong
when
she
had
attached
importance
to
anything
that
her
aunt
had
said
under
the
influence
of
delirium
having
adopted
this
conclusion
she
resolved
to
face
the
prospect
of
a
night
s
solitude
by
the
rather
than
permit
mosey
to
have
a
second
opportunity
of
drawing
her
own
inferences
from
what
she
might
hear
in
miss
letitia
s
room
do
you
mean
to
keep
me
waiting
much
longer
miss
not
a
moment
longer
now
you
are
composed
again
emily
answered
i
have
been
thinking
of
what
has
happened
and
i
fail
to
see
any
necessity
for
putting
off
your
departure
until
the
doctor
comes
morning
there
is
really
no
objection
to
your
leaving
me
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
there
an
objection
i
have
already
told
you
i
can
t
reconcile
it
to
my
conscience
to
leave
you
here
by
yourself
i
am
not
an
inhuman
woman
said
mosey
putting
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
smitten
with
pity
for
herself
emily
tried
the
effect
of
a
conciliatory
reply
i
am
grateful
for
your
kindness
in
offering
to
stay
with
me
she
said
very
good
of
you
i
m
sure
mosey
answered
ironically
but
for
all
that
you
persist
in
sending
me
i
persist
in
thinking
that
there
is
no
necessity
for
my
keeping
you
here
until
oh
have
it
your
own
way
i
am
not
reduced
to
forcing
my
company
on
mosey
put
her
handkerchief
in
her
pocket
and
asserted
her
dignity
with
head
erect
and
steps
she
walked
out
of
the
room
emily
was
left
in
the
cottage
alone
with
her
dying
aunt

miss
jethro
a
fortnight
after
the
disappearance
of
ellmother
and
the
dismissal
of
mosey
doctor
allday
entered
his
punctual
to
the
hour
at
which
he
was
accustomed
to
receive
patients
an
occasional
wrinkling
of
his
eyebrows
accompanied
by
an
intermittent
restlessness
in
his
movements
appeared
to
indicate
some
disturbance
of
this
worthy
man
s
professional
composure
his
mind
was
indeed
not
at
ease
even
the
inexcitable
old
doctor
had
felt
the
attraction
which
had
already
conquered
three
such
dissimilar
people
as
alban
morris
cecilia
wyvil
and
francine
de
sor
he
was
thinking
of
emily
a
ring
at
the
announced
the
arrival
of
the
first
patient
the
servant
introduced
a
tall
lady
dressed
simply
and
elegantly
in
dark
apparel
noticeable
features
of
a
jewish
cast
worn
and
haggard
but
still
preserving
their
grandeur
of
form
were
visible
through
her
veil
she
moved
with
grace
and
dignity
and
she
stated
her
object
in
consulting
doctor
allday
with
the
ease
of
a
woman
i
come
to
ask
your
opinion
sir
on
the
state
of
my
heart
she
said
and
i
am
recommended
by
a
patient
who
has
consulted
you
with
advantage
to
she
placed
a
card
on
the
doctor
s
and
added
i
have
become
acquainted
with
the
lady
by
being
one
of
the
lodgers
in
her
the
doctor
recognized
the
name
and
the
usual
proceedings
ensued
after
careful
examination
he
arrived
at
a
favorable
conclusion
i
may
tell
you
at
once
he
said
there
is
no
reason
to
be
alarmed
about
the
state
of
your
i
have
never
felt
any
alarm
about
myself
she
answered
quietly
a
sudden
death
is
an
easy
death
if
one
s
affairs
are
settled
it
seems
on
that
account
to
be
the
death
to
prefer
my
object
was
to
settle
affairs
such
as
they
are
if
you
had
considered
my
life
to
be
in
danger
is
there
nothing
the
matter
with
me
i
don
t
say
that
the
doctor
replied
the
action
of
your
heart
is
very
feeble
take
the
medicine
that
i
shall
prescribe
pay
a
little
more
attention
to
eating
and
drinking
than
ladies
usually
do
don
t
run
upstairs
and
don
t
fatigue
yourself
by
violent
exercise
and
i
see
no
reason
why
you
shouldn
t
live
to
be
an
old
god
forbid
the
lady
said
to
herself
she
turned
away
and
looked
out
of
the
window
with
a
bitter
smile
doctor
allday
wrote
his
prescription
are
you
likely
to
make
a
long
stay
in
london
he
asked
i
am
here
for
a
little
while
only
do
you
wish
to
see
me
again
i
should
like
to
see
you
once
more
before
you
go
away
if
you
can
make
it
convenient
what
name
shall
i
put
on
the
prescription
miss
a
remarkable
name
the
doctor
said
in
his
way
miss
jethro
s
bitter
smile
showed
itself
again
without
otherwise
noticing
what
doctor
allday
had
said
she
laid
the
consultation
fee
on
the
table
at
the
same
moment
the
footman
appeared
with
a
letter
from
miss
emily
brown
he
said
no
answer
he
held
the
door
open
as
he
delivered
the
message
seeing
that
miss
jethro
was
about
to
leave
the
room
she
dismissed
him
by
a
gesture
and
returning
to
the
table
pointed
to
the
letter
was
your
correspondent
lately
a
pupil
at
miss
ladd
s
school
she
inquired
my
correspondent
has
just
left
miss
ladd
the
doctor
answered
are
you
a
friend
of
hers
i
am
acquainted
with
you
would
be
doing
the
poor
child
a
kindness
if
you
would
go
and
see
her
she
has
no
friends
in
pardon
me
she
has
an
her
aunt
died
a
week
are
there
no
other
relations
none
a
melancholy
state
of
things
isn
t
it
she
would
have
been
absolutely
alone
in
the
house
if
i
had
not
sent
one
of
my
women
servants
to
stay
with
her
for
the
present
did
you
know
her
father
miss
jethro
passed
over
the
question
as
if
she
had
not
heard
it
has
the
young
lady
dismissed
her
aunt
s
servants
she
asked
her
aunt
kept
but
one
servant
ma
am
the
woman
has
spared
miss
emily
the
trouble
of
dismissing
he
briefly
alluded
to
ellmother
s
desertion
of
her
mistress
i
can
t
explain
it
he
said
when
he
had
done
can
what
makes
you
think
sir
that
i
can
help
you
i
have
never
even
heard
of
the
servant
and
the
mistress
was
a
stranger
to
at
doctor
allday
s
age
a
man
is
not
easily
discouraged
by
reproof
even
when
it
is
administered
by
a
handsome
woman
i
thought
you
might
have
known
miss
emily
s
father
he
persisted
miss
jethro
rose
and
wished
him
i
must
not
occupy
any
more
of
your
valuable
time
she
said
suppose
you
wait
a
minute
the
doctor
suggested
impenetrable
as
ever
he
rang
the
bell
any
patients
in
the
he
inquired
you
see
i
have
time
to
spare
he
resumed
when
the
man
had
replied
in
the
negative
i
take
an
interest
in
this
poor
girl
and
i
thought
if
you
think
that
i
take
an
interest
in
her
too
miss
jethro
interposed
you
are
perfectly
right
i
knew
her
father
she
added
abruptly
the
allusion
to
emily
having
apparently
reminded
her
of
the
question
which
she
had
hitherto
declined
to
notice
in
that
case
doctor
allday
proceeded
i
want
a
word
of
advice
won
t
you
sit
down
she
took
a
chair
in
silence
an
irregular
movement
in
the
lower
part
of
her
veil
seemed
to
indicate
that
she
was
breathing
with
difficulty
the
doctor
observed
her
with
close
attention
let
me
see
my
prescription
again
he
said
having
added
an
ingredient
he
handed
it
back
with
a
word
of
explanation
your
nerves
are
more
out
of
order
than
i
supposed
the
hardest
disease
to
cure
that
i
know
of
is
the
hint
could
hardly
have
been
plainer
but
it
was
lost
on
miss
jethro
whatever
her
troubles
might
be
her
medical
adviser
was
not
made
acquainted
with
them
quietly
folding
up
the
prescription
she
reminded
him
that
he
had
proposed
to
ask
her
advice
in
what
way
can
i
be
of
service
to
you
she
inquired
i
am
afraid
i
must
try
your
patience
the
doctor
acknowledged
if
i
am
to
answer
that
question
with
these
prefatory
words
he
described
the
events
that
had
followed
mosey
s
appearance
at
the
cottage
i
am
only
doing
justice
to
this
foolish
woman
he
continued
when
i
tell
you
that
she
came
here
after
she
had
left
miss
emily
and
did
her
best
to
set
matters
right
i
went
to
the
poor
girl
directly
and
i
felt
it
my
duty
after
looking
at
her
aunt
not
to
leave
her
alone
for
that
night
when
i
got
home
the
next
morning
whom
do
you
think
i
found
waiting
for
me
ellmother
he
stopped
in
the
expectation
that
miss
jethro
would
express
some
surprise
not
a
word
passed
her
lips
mrs
ellmother
s
object
was
to
ask
how
her
mistress
was
going
on
the
doctor
proceeded
every
day
while
miss
letitia
still
lived
she
came
here
to
make
the
same
inquiry
without
a
word
of
explanation
on
the
day
of
the
funeral
there
she
was
at
the
church
dressed
in
deep
mourning
and
as
i
can
personally
testify
crying
bitterly
when
the
ceremony
was
over
can
you
believe
it
she
slipped
away
before
miss
emily
or
i
could
speak
to
her
we
have
seen
nothing
more
of
her
and
heard
nothing
more
from
that
time
to
he
stopped
again
the
silent
lady
still
listening
without
making
any
remark
have
you
no
opinion
to
express
the
doctor
asked
bluntly
i
am
waiting
miss
jethro
answered
waiting
for
what
i
haven
t
heard
yet
why
you
want
my
doctor
allday
s
observation
of
humanity
had
hitherto
reckoned
want
of
caution
among
the
deficient
moral
qualities
in
the
natures
of
women
he
set
down
miss
jethro
as
a
remarkable
exception
to
a
general
rule
i
want
you
to
advise
me
as
to
the
right
course
to
take
with
miss
emily
he
said
she
has
assured
me
she
attaches
no
serious
importance
to
her
aunt
s
wanderings
when
the
poor
old
lady
s
fever
was
at
its
worst
i
don
t
doubt
that
she
speaks
the
truth
but
i
have
my
own
reasons
for
being
afraid
that
she
is
deceiving
herself
will
you
bear
this
in
mind
yes
if
it
s
in
plain
words
miss
jethro
you
think
i
am
still
wandering
from
the
point
i
have
got
to
the
point
yesterday
miss
emily
told
me
that
she
hoped
to
be
soon
composed
enough
to
examine
the
papers
left
by
her
miss
jethro
suddenly
turned
in
her
chair
and
looked
at
doctor
allday
are
you
beginning
to
feel
interested
the
doctor
asked
mischievously
she
neither
acknowledged
nor
denied
it
go
on
was
all
she
said
i
don
t
know
how
feel
he
proceeded
am
afraid
of
the
discoveries
which
she
may
make
and
i
am
strongly
tempted
to
advise
her
to
leave
the
proposed
examination
to
her
aunt
s
lawyer
is
there
anything
in
your
knowledge
of
miss
emily
s
late
father
which
tells
you
that
i
am
right
before
i
reply
said
miss
jethro
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
let
the
young
lady
speak
for
how
is
she
to
do
that
the
doctor
asked
miss
jethro
pointed
to
the
writing
table
look
there
she
said
you
have
not
yet
opened
miss
emily
s
chapter
xvii
doctor
allday
absorbed
in
the
effort
to
overcome
his
patient
s
reserve
the
doctor
had
forgotten
emily
s
letter
he
opened
it
immediately
after
reading
the
first
sentence
he
looked
up
with
an
expression
of
annoyance
she
has
begun
the
examination
of
the
papers
already
he
said
then
i
can
be
of
no
further
use
to
you
miss
jethro
rejoined
she
made
a
second
attempt
to
leave
the
room
doctor
allday
turned
to
the
next
page
of
the
letter
stop
he
cried
she
has
found
something
and
here
it
he
held
up
a
small
printed
handbill
which
had
been
placed
between
the
first
and
second
pages
suppose
you
look
at
it
he
said
whether
i
am
interested
in
it
or
not
miss
jethro
asked
you
may
be
interested
in
what
miss
emily
says
about
it
in
her
do
you
propose
to
show
me
her
letter
i
propose
to
read
it
to
miss
jethro
took
the
handbill
without
further
objection
it
was
expressed
in
these
words
murder
pounds
whereas
a
murder
was
committed
on
the
thirtieth
september
at
the
inn
in
the
village
of
zeeland
hampshire
the
above
reward
will
be
paid
to
any
person
or
persons
whose
exertions
shall
lead
to
the
arrest
and
conviction
of
the
suspected
murderer
name
not
known
supposed
age
between
twenty
and
thirty
years
a
man
of
small
stature
fair

delicate

clear
blue
eyes

light
and
cut
rather
short
clean
shaven
with
the

of
narrow

hands
wore
valuable
rings
on
the
two
last
fingers
of
the
left

neatly
in

if
on
a
pedestrian
excursion
remarkably
good

full
and
persuasive

apply
to
the
chief
inspector
metropolitan
police
office
miss
jethro
laid
aside
the
handbill
without
any
visible
appearance
of
agitation
the
doctor
took
up
emily
s
letter
and
read
as
follows
you
will
be
as
much
relieved
as
i
was
my
kind
friend
when
you
look
at
the
paper
inclosed
i
found
it
loose
in
a
blank
book
with
cuttings
from
newspapers
and
odd
announcements
of
lost
property
and
other
curious
things
all
huddled
together
between
the
leaves
which
my
aunt
no
doubt
intended
to
set
in
order
and
fix
in
their
proper
places
she
must
have
been
thinking
of
her
book
poor
soul
in
her
last
illness
here
is
the
origin
of
those
terrible
words
which
frightened
stupid
mosey
is
it
not
encouraging
to
have
discovered
such
a
confirmation
of
my
opinion
as
this
i
feel
a
new
interest
in
looking
over
the
papers
that
still
remain
to
be
examined
before
he
could
get
to
the
end
of
the
sentence
miss
jethro
s
agitation
broke
through
her
reserve
do
what
you
proposed
to
do
she
burst
out
vehemently
stop
her
at
once
from
carrying
her
examination
any
further
if
she
hesitates
insist
on
it
at
last
doctor
allday
had
triumphed
it
has
been
a
long
time
coming
he
remarked
in
his
cool
way
and
it
s
all
the
more
welcome
on
that
account
you
dread
the
discoveries
she
may
make
miss
jethro
as
i
do
and
know
what
those
discoveries
may
what
i
do
know
or
don
t
know
is
of
no
she
answered
sharply
excuse
me
it
is
of
very
serious
importance
i
have
no
authority
over
this
poor
girl
i
am
not
even
an
old
friend
you
tell
me
to
insist
help
me
to
declare
honestly
that
i
know
of
circumstances
which
justify
me
and
i
may
insist
to
some
miss
jethro
lifted
her
veil
for
the
first
time
and
eyed
him
searchingly
i
believe
i
can
trust
you
she
said
now
listen
the
one
consideration
on
which
i
consent
to
open
my
lips
is
consideration
for
miss
emily
s
tranquillity
promise
me
absolute
secrecy
on
your
word
of
he
gave
the
promise
i
want
to
know
one
thing
first
miss
jethro
proceeded
did
she
tell
you
as
she
once
told
me
that
her
father
had
died
of
did
you
put
any
questions
to
her
i
asked
how
long
ago
it
and
she
told
you
she
told
you
wish
to
know
doctor
allday
what
discoveries
miss
emily
may
yet
make
among
her
aunt
s
papers
judge
for
yourself
when
i
tell
you
that
she
has
been
deceived
about
her
father
s
do
you
mean
that
he
is
still
living
i
mean
that
she
has
been
deceived
purposely
deceived
about
the
of
his
who
was
the
wretch
who
did
it
you
are
wronging
the
dead
sir
the
truth
can
only
have
been
concealed
out
of
the
purest
motives
of
love
and
pity
i
don
t
desire
to
disguise
the
conclusion
at
which
i
have
arrived
after
what
i
have
heard
from
yourself
the
person
responsible
must
be
miss
emily
s
aunt
and
the
old
servant
must
have
been
in
her
confidence
remember
you
are
bound
in
honor
not
to
repeat
to
any
living
creature
what
i
have
just
the
doctor
followed
miss
jethro
to
the
door
you
have
not
yet
told
me
he
said
her
father
i
have
no
more
to
tell
with
those
words
she
left
him
he
rang
for
his
servant
to
wait
until
the
hour
at
which
he
was
accustomed
to
go
out
might
be
to
leave
emily
s
peace
of
mind
at
the
mercy
of
an
accident
i
am
going
to
the
cottage
he
said
if
anybody
wants
me
i
shall
be
back
in
a
quarter
of
an
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
house
he
remembered
that
emily
would
probably
expect
him
to
return
the
handbill
as
he
took
it
up
the
first
lines
caught
his
eye
he
read
the
date
at
which
the
murder
had
been
committed
for
the
second
time
on
a
sudden
the
ruddy
color
left
his
face
good
god
he
cried
her
father
was
murdered
and
that
woman
was
concerned
in
following
the
impulse
that
urged
him
he
secured
the
handbill
in
his
pocketbook
snatched
up
the
card
which
his
patient
had
presented
as
her
introduction
and
instantly
left
the
house
he
called
the
first
cab
that
passed
him
and
drove
to
miss
jethro
s
lodgings
gone
was
the
servant
s
answer
when
he
inquired
for
her
he
insisted
on
speaking
to
the
landlady
hardly
ten
minutes
have
passed
he
said
since
she
left
my
hardly
ten
minutes
have
passed
the
landlady
replied
since
that
message
was
brought
here
by
a
the
message
had
been
evidently
written
in
great
haste
i
am
unexpectedly
obliged
to
leave
london
a
bank
note
is
inclosed
in
payment
of
my
debt
to
you
i
will
send
for
my
the
doctor
withdrew
unexpectedly
obliged
to
leave
london
he
repeated
as
he
got
into
the
cab
again
her
flight
condemns
her
not
a
doubt
of
it
now
as
fast
as
you
can
he
shouted
to
the
man
directing
him
to
drive
to
emily
s
cottage
chapter
xviii
miss
ladd
arriving
at
the
cottage
doctor
allday
discovered
a
gentleman
who
was
just
closing
the
garden
gate
behind
him
has
miss
emily
had
a
visitor
he
inquired
when
the
servant
admitted
him
the
gentleman
left
a
letter
for
miss
emily
did
he
ask
to
see
her
he
asked
after
miss
letitia
s
health
when
he
heard
that
she
was
dead
he
seemed
to
be
startled
and
went
away
did
he
give
his
name
no
the
doctor
found
emily
absorbed
over
her
letter
his
anxiety
to
forestall
any
possible
discovery
of
the
deception
which
had
concealed
the
terrible
story
of
her
father
s
death
kept
doctor
allday
s
vigilance
on
the
watch
he
doubted
the
gentleman
who
had
abstained
from
giving
his
name
he
even
distrusted
the
other
unknown
person
who
had
written
to
emily
she
looked
up
her
face
relieved
him
of
his
misgivings
before
she
could
speak
at
last
i
have
heard
from
my
dearest
friend
she
said
you
remember
what
i
told
you
about
cecilia
here
is
a
letter
a
long
delightful
letter
from
the
engadine
left
at
the
door
by
some
gentleman
unknown
i
was
questioning
the
servant
when
you
rang
the
you
may
question
me
if
you
prefer
it
i
arrived
just
as
the
gentleman
was
shutting
your
garden
oh
tell
me
what
was
he
like
tall
and
thin
and
dark
wore
a
vile
felt
hat
had
nasty
wrinkles
between
his
eyebrows
the
sort
of
man
i
distrust
by
why
because
he
doesn
t
do
you
mean
that
he
wore
a
beard
yes
a
curly
black
emily
clasped
her
hands
in
amazement
can
it
be
alban
morris
she
exclaimed
the
doctor
looked
at
her
with
a
sardonic
smile
he
thought
it
likely
that
he
had
discovered
her
sweetheart
who
is
alban
morris
he
asked
the
at
miss
ladd
s
doctor
allday
dropped
the
subject
masters
at
ladies
schools
were
not
persons
who
interested
him
he
returned
to
the
purpose
which
had
brought
him
to
the
cottage
and
produced
the
handbill
that
had
been
sent
to
him
in
emily
s
letter
i
suppose
you
want
to
have
it
back
again
he
said
she
took
it
from
him
and
looked
at
it
with
interest
isn
t
it
strange
she
suggested
that
the
murderer
should
have
escaped
with
such
a
careful
description
of
him
as
this
circulated
all
over
england
she
read
the
description
to
the
doctor
name
not
known
supposed
age
between
and
thirty
years
a
man
of
small
stature
fair
complexion
delicate
features
clear
blue
eyes
hair
light
and
cut
rather
short
clean
shaven
with
the
exception
of
narrow
small
white
hands
wore
valuable
rings
on
the
two
last
fingers
of
the
left
hand
dressed
neatly
that
part
of
the
description
is
useless
the
doctor
remarked
he
would
change
his
but
could
he
change
his
voice
emily
objected
listen
to
this
remarkably
good
voice
smooth
full
and
and
here
again
ingratiating
perhaps
you
will
say
he
could
put
on
an
appearance
of
rudeness
i
will
say
this
my
dear
he
would
be
able
to
disguise
himself
so
effectually
that
people
out
of
a
hundred
would
fail
to
identify
him
either
by
his
voice
or
his
how
look
back
at
the
description
hair
cut
rather
short
clean
shaven
with
the
exception
of
narrow
the
wretch
was
safe
from
pursuit
he
had
ample
time
at
his
disposal
don
t
you
see
how
he
could
completely
alter
the
appearance
of
his
head
and
face
no
more
my
dear
of
this
disagreeable
subject
let
us
get
to
something
interesting
have
you
found
anything
else
among
your
aunt
s
papers
i
have
met
with
a
great
disappointment
emily
replied
did
i
tell
you
how
i
discovered
the
handbill
i
found
it
with
the
and
the
newspaper
cuttings
under
a
collection
of
empty
boxes
and
bottles
in
a
drawer
of
the
and
i
naturally
expected
to
make
far
more
interesting
discoveries
in
this
room
my
search
was
over
in
five
minutes
nothing
in
the
cabinet
there
in
the
corner
but
a
few
books
and
some
china
nothing
in
the
on
that
but
a
packet
of
and
some
nothing
here
in
the
drawers
but
tradesmen
s
receipts
materials
for
knitting
and
old
photographs
she
must
have
destroyed
all
her
papers
poor
dear
before
her
last
illness
and
the
handbill
and
the
other
things
can
only
have
escaped
because
they
were
left
in
a
place
which
she
never
thought
of
examining
isn
t
it
provoking
with
a
mind
inexpressibly
relieved
good
doctor
allday
asked
permission
to
return
to
his
patients
leaving
emily
to
devote
herself
to
her
friend
s
letter
on
his
way
out
he
noticed
that
the
door
of
the
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
passage
stood
open
since
miss
letitia
s
death
the
room
had
not
been
used
well
within
view
stood
the
to
which
emily
had
alluded
the
doctor
advanced
to
the
house
door
reflected
hesitated
and
looked
toward
the
empty
room
it
had
struck
him
that
there
might
be
a
second
drawer
which
emily
had
overlooked
would
he
be
justified
in
setting
this
doubt
at
rest
if
he
passed
over
ordinary
scruples
it
would
not
be
without
excuse
miss
letitia
had
spoken
to
him
of
her
affairs
and
had
asked
him
to
act
in
emily
s
interest
as
with
her
lawyer
the
rapid
progress
of
the
illness
had
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
execute
the
necessary
codicil
but
the
doctor
had
been
morally
if
not
legally
taken
into
her
confidence
and
for
that
reason
he
decided
that
he
had
a
right
in
this
serious
matter
to
satisfy
his
own
mind
a
glance
was
enough
to
show
him
that
no
second
drawer
had
been
overlooked
there
was
no
other
discovery
to
detain
the
doctor
the
wardrobe
only
contained
the
poor
old
lady
s
clothes
the
one
cupboard
was
open
and
empty
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
room
he
went
back
to
the
while
he
had
the
opportunity
it
might
not
be
amiss
to
make
sure
that
emily
had
thoroughly
examined
those
old
boxes
and
bottles
which
she
had
alluded
to
with
some
little
contempt
the
drawer
was
of
considerable
length
when
he
tried
to
pull
it
completely
out
from
the
grooves
in
which
it
ran
it
resisted
him
in
his
present
frame
of
mind
this
was
a
suspicious
circumstance
in
itself
he
cleared
away
the
litter
so
as
to
make
room
for
the
introduction
of
his
hand
and
arm
into
the
drawer
in
another
moment
his
fingers
touched
a
piece
of
paper
jammed
between
the
inner
end
of
the
drawer
and
the
bottom
of
the
flat
surface
of
the
with
a
little
care
he
succeeded
in
extricating
the
paper
only
pausing
to
satisfy
himself
that
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
found
and
to
close
the
drawer
after
replacing
its
contents
he
left
the
cottage
the
cab
was
waiting
for
him
on
the
drive
back
to
his
own
house
he
opened
the
crumpled
paper
it
proved
to
be
a
letter
addressed
to
miss
letitia
and
it
was
signed
by
no
less
a
person
than
emily
s
schoolmistress
looking
back
from
the
end
to
the
beginning
doctor
allday
discovered
in
the
first
sentence
the
name
of
miss
jethro
but
for
the
interview
of
that
morning
with
his
patient
he
might
have
doubted
the
propriety
of
making
himself
further
acquainted
with
the
letter
as
things
were
he
read
it
without
hesitation
dear
madam
i
can
not
but
regard
it
as
providential
circumstance
that
your
niece
in
writing
to
you
from
my
house
should
have
mentioned
among
other
events
of
her
school
life
the
arrival
of
my
new
teacher
miss
jethro
to
say
that
i
was
surprised
is
to
express
very
inadequately
what
i
felt
when
i
read
your
letter
informing
me
confidentially
that
i
had
employed
a
woman
who
was
unworthy
to
associate
with
the
young
persons
placed
under
my
care
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
suppose
that
a
lady
in
your
position
and
possessed
of
your
high
principles
would
make
such
a
serious
accusation
as
this
without
unanswerable
reasons
for
doing
so
at
the
same
time
i
can
not
consistently
with
my
duty
as
a
christian
suffer
my
opinion
of
miss
jethro
to
be
in
any
way
modified
until
proofs
are
laid
before
me
which
it
is
impossible
to
dispute
placing
the
same
confidence
in
your
discretion
which
you
have
placed
in
mine
i
now
inclose
the
references
and
testimonials
which
miss
jethro
submitted
to
me
when
she
presented
herself
to
fill
the
vacant
situation
in
my
school
i
earnestly
request
you
to
lose
no
time
in
instituting
the
confidential
inquiries
which
you
have
volunteered
to
make
whatever
the
result
may
be
pray
return
to
me
the
inclosures
which
i
have
trusted
to
your
care
and
believe
me
dear
madam
in
much
suspense
and
anxiety
sincerely
yours
amelia
it
is
needless
to
describe
at
any
length
the
impression
which
these
lines
produced
on
the
doctor
if
he
had
heard
what
emily
had
heard
at
the
time
of
her
aunt
s
last
illness
he
would
have
called
to
mind
miss
letitia
s
betrayal
of
her
interest
in
some
man
unknown
whom
she
believed
to
have
been
beguiled
by
miss
jethro
and
he
would
have
perceived
that
the
vindictive
hatred
thus
produced
must
have
inspired
the
letter
of
denunciation
which
the
schoolmistress
had
acknowledged
he
would
also
have
inferred
that
miss
letitia
s
inquiries
had
proved
her
accusation
to
be
well
founded
if
he
had
known
of
the
new
teacher
s
sudden
dismissal
from
the
school
as
things
were
he
was
merely
confirmed
in
his
bad
opinion
of
miss
jethro
and
he
was
induced
on
reflection
to
keep
his
discovery
to
himself
if
poor
miss
emily
saw
the
old
lady
exhibited
in
the
character
of
an
informer
he
thought
what
a
blow
would
be
struck
at
her
innocent
respect
for
the
memory
of
her
aunt
chapter
xix
sir
jervis
redwood
in
the
meantime
emily
left
by
herself
had
her
own
correspondence
to
occupy
her
attention
besides
the
letter
from
cecilia
directed
to
the
care
of
sir
jervis
redwood
she
had
received
some
lines
addressed
to
her
by
sir
jervis
himself
the
two
inclosures
had
been
secured
in
a
sealed
envelope
directed
to
the
cottage
if
alban
morris
had
been
indeed
the
person
trusted
as
messenger
by
sir
jervis
the
conclusion
that
followed
filled
emily
with
overpowering
emotions
of
curiosity
and
surprise
having
no
longer
the
motive
of
serving
and
protecting
her
alban
must
nevertheless
have
taken
the
journey
to
northumberland
he
must
have
gained
sir
jervis
redwood
s
favor
and
confidence
and
he
might
even
have
been
a
guest
at
the
baronet
s
country
seat
when
cecilia
s
letter
arrived
what
did
it
mean
emily
looked
back
at
her
experience
of
her
last
day
at
school
and
recalled
her
consultation
with
alban
on
the
subject
of
rook
was
he
still
bent
on
clearing
up
his
suspicions
of
sir
jervis
s
housekeeper
and
with
that
end
in
view
had
he
followed
the
woman
on
her
return
to
her
master
s
place
of
abode
suddenly
almost
irritably
emily
snatched
up
sir
jervis
s
letter
before
the
doctor
had
come
in
she
had
glanced
at
it
and
had
thrown
it
aside
in
her
impatience
to
read
what
cecilia
had
written
in
her
present
altered
frame
of
mind
she
was
inclined
to
think
that
sir
jervis
might
be
the
more
interesting
correspondent
of
the
two
on
returning
to
his
letter
she
was
disappointed
at
the
outset
in
the
first
place
his
handwriting
was
so
abominably
bad
that
she
was
obliged
to
guess
at
his
meaning
in
the
second
place
he
never
hinted
at
the
circumstances
under
which
cecilia
s
letter
had
been
confided
to
the
gentleman
who
had
left
it
at
her
door
she
would
once
more
have
treated
the
baronet
s
communication
with
contempt
but
for
the
discovery
that
it
contained
an
offer
of
employment
in
london
addressed
to
herself
sir
jervis
had
necessarily
been
obliged
to
engage
another
secretary
in
emily
s
absence
but
he
was
still
in
want
of
a
person
to
serve
his
literary
interests
in
london
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
discoveries
made
by
modern
travelers
in
central
america
had
been
reported
from
time
to
time
by
the
english
press
and
he
wished
copies
to
be
taken
of
any
notices
of
this
sort
which
might
be
found
on
referring
to
the
files
of
newspapers
kept
in
the
of
the
british
museum
if
emily
considered
herself
capable
of
contributing
in
this
way
to
the
completeness
of
his
great
work
on
the
ruined
cities
she
had
only
to
apply
to
his
bookseller
in
london
who
would
pay
her
the
customary
remuneration
and
give
her
every
assistance
of
which
she
might
stand
in
need
the
bookseller
s
name
and
address
followed
with
nothing
legible
but
the
two
words
bond
street
and
there
was
an
end
of
sir
jervis
s
proposal
emily
laid
it
aside
deferring
her
answer
until
she
had
read
cecilia
s
letter

sentiments

union
of
sympathies

acquainted
with
each
other
if
there
is
anything
in
me
to
be
proud
of
i

i
tell
you
that
she
is
just
two
years
older
than
i
am
i
declare
i
am
forgetting
him
again
he
is
lord
janeaway
such
a
quiet
modest
man
and
so
easily
amused
he
carries
with
him
everywhere
a
dirty
little
tin
case
with
air
holes
in
the
cover
he
goes
softly
poking
about
among
bushes
and
brambles
and
under
rocks
and
behind
old
wooden
houses
when
he
has
caught
some
hideous
insect
that
makes
one
shudder
he
blushes
with
pleasure
and
looks
at
his
wife
and
me
and
says
with
the
prettiest
lisp
this
is
what
i
call
enjoying
the
to
see
the
manner
in
which
he
obeys
her
is
between
ourselves
to
feel
proud
of
being
a
woman
where
was
i
oh
at
the
d
never
emily
i
say
it
with
a
solemn
sense
of
the
claims
of
truth
never
have
i
eaten
such
an
infamous
abominable
maddeningly
bad
dinner
as
the
dinner
they
gave
us
on
our
first
day
at
the
hotel
i
ask
you
if
i
am
not
patient
i
appeal
to
your
own
recollection
of
occasions
when
i
have
exhibited
extraordinary
my
dear
i
held
out
until
they
brought
the
pastry
round
i
took
one
bite
and
committed
the
most
shocking
offense
against
good
manners
at
table
that
you
can
imagine
my
handkerchief
my
poor
innocent
handkerchief
received
the
horrid
please
suppose
the
rest
my
hair
stands
on
end
when
i
think
of
it
our
neighbors
at
the
table
saw
me
the
coarse
men
laughed
the
sweet
young
bride
sincerely
feeling
for
me
said
will
you
allow
me
to
shake
hands
i
did
exactly
what
you
have
done
the
day
before
such
was
the
beginning
of
my
friendship
with
lady
doris
janeaway
we
are
two
resolute
women
i
mean
that
is
resolute
and
that
i
follow
her
and
we
have
asserted
our
right
of
dining
to
our
own
satisfaction
by
means
of
an
interview
with
the
chief
cook
this
interesting
person
is
an
in
the
french
army
instead
of
making
excuses
he
confessed
that
the
barbarous
tastes
of
the
english
and
american
visitors
had
so
discouraged
him
that
he
had
lost
all
pride
and
pleasure
in
the
exercise
of
his
art
as
an
example
of
what
he
meant
he
mentioned
his
experience
of
two
young
englishmen
who
could
speak
no
foreign
language
the
waiters
reported
that
they
objected
to
their
breakfasts
and
especially
to
the
eggs
thereupon
to
translate
the
frenchman
s
own
way
of
putting
it
he
exhausted
himself
in
exquisite
preparations
of
eggs
a

gratin
a

a
la
dauphine
a
la

a
la

a

a
la
and
so
on
and
so
on
still
the
two
young
gentlemen
were
not
satisfied
the
infuriated
wounded
in
his
honor
disgraced
as
a
professor
insisted
on
an
explanation
what
in
heaven
s
name
they
want
for
breakfast
they
wanted
boiled
eggs
and
a
fish
which
they
called
a
it
was
impossible
he
said
to
express
his
contempt
for
the
english
idea
of
a
breakfast
in
the
presence
of
ladies
you
know
how
a
cat
expresses
herself
in
the
presence
of
a
dog
and
you
will
understand
the
allusion
oh
emily
what
dinners
we
have
had
in
our
own
room
since
we
spoke
to
that
noble
cook
have
i
any
more
news
to
send
you
are
you
interested
my
dear
in
eloquent
young
clergymen
on
our
first
appearance
at
the
public
table
we
noticed
a
remarkable
air
of
depression
among
the
ladies
had
some
adventurous
gentleman
tried
to
climb
a
mountain
and
failed
had
disastrous
political
news
arrived
from
england
a
defeat
of
the
conservatives
for
instance
had
a
revolution
in
the
fashions
broken
out
in
paris
and
had
all
our
best
dresses
become
of
no
earthly
value
to
us
i
applied
for
information
to
the
only
lady
present
who
shone
on
the
company
with
a
cheerful
face
my
friend
doris
of
course
what
day
was
yesterday
she
asked
sunday
i
answered
of
all
melancholy
sundays
she
continued
the
most
melancholy
in
the
calendar
mr
miles
mirabel
preached
his
farewell
sermon
in
our
temporary
chapel
and
you
have
not
recovered
it
yet
we
are
all
miss
this
naturally
interested
me
i
asked
what
sort
of
sermons
mirabel
preached
lady
janeaway
said
come
up
to
our
room
after
dinner
the
subject
is
too
distressing
to
be
discussed
in
she
began
by
making
me
personally
acquainted
with
the
reverend
gentleman
that
is
to
say
she
showed
me
the
photographic
portraits
of
him
they
were
two
in
number
one
only
presented
his
face
the
other
exhibited
him
at
full
length
adorned
in
his
surplice
every
lady
in
the
congregation
had
received
the
two
photographs
as
a
farewell
present
my
portraits
lady
doris
remarked
are
the
only
complete
specimens
the
others
have
been
irretrievably
ruined
by
you
will
now
expect
a
personal
description
of
this
fascinating
man
what
the
photographs
failed
to
tell
me
my
friend
was
so
kind
as
to
complete
from
the
resources
of
her
own
experience
here
is
the
result
presented
to
the
best
of
my
ability
he
is
young
not
yet
thirty
years
of
age
his
complexion
is
fair
his
features
are
delicate
his
eyes
are
clear
blue
he
has
pretty
hands
and
rings
prettier
still
and
such
a
voice
and
such
manners
you
will
say
there
are
plenty
of
pet
parsons
who
answer
to
this
description
wait
a
little
i
have
kept
his
chief
distinction
till
the
last
his
beautiful
light
hair
flows
in
profusion
over
his
shoulders
and
his
glossy
beard
waves
at
apostolic
length
down
to
the
lower
buttons
of
his
waistcoat
what
do
you
think
of
the
reverend
miles
mirabel
now
the
life
and
adventures
of
our
charming
young
clergyman
bear
eloquent
testimony
to
the
saintly
patience
of
his
disposition
under
trials
which
would
have
overwhelmed
an
ordinary
man
lady
doris
please
notice
quotes
in
this
place
the
language
of
his
admirers
and
i
report
lady
doris
he
has
been
clerk
in
a
lawyer
s
office
unjustly
dismissed
he
has
given
readings
from
shakespeare
infamously
neglected
he
has
been
secretary
to
a
promenade
concert
company
deceived
by
a
penniless
manager
he
has
been
employed
in
negotiations
for
making
foreign
railways
repudiated
by
an
unprincipled
government
he
has
been
translator
to
a
publishing
house
declared
incapable
by
envious
newspapers
and
reviews
he
has
taken
refuge
in
dramatic
criticism
dismissed
by
a
corrupt
editor
through
all
these
means
of
purification
for
the
priestly
career
he
passed
at
last
into
the
one
sphere
that
was
worthy
of
him
he
entered
the
church
under
the
protection
of
influential
friends
oh
happy
change
from
that
moment
his
labors
have
been
blessed
twice
already

has
been
presented
with
silver

sovereigns

where
he
may
precious
sympathies
environ
him
and
domestic
affection
places
his
knife
and
fork
at
innumerable
family
tables
after
a
continental
career
which
will
leave
undying
recollections
he
is
now
recalled
to
england
at
the
suggestion
of
a
person
of
distinction
in
the
church
who
prefers
a
mild
climate
it
will
now
be
his
valued
privilege
to
represent
an
absent
rector
in
a
country
living
remote
from
cities
secluded
in
pastoral
solitude
among
simple
breeders
of
sheep
may
the
shepherd
prove
worthy
of
the
flock
here
again
my
dear
i
must
give
the
merit
where
the
merit
is
due
this
memoir
of
mirabel
is
not
of
my
writing
it
formed
part
of
his
farewell
sermon
preserved
in
the
memory
of
lady
doris
and
it
shows
once
more
in
the
language
of
his
admirers
that
the
truest
humility
may
be
found
in
the
character
of
the
most
gifted
man
let
me
only
add
that
you
will
have
opportunities
of
seeing
and
hearing
this
popular
preacher
when
circumstances
permit
him
to
address
congregations
in
the
large
towns
i
am
at
the
end
of
my
news
and
i
begin
to
feel
after
this
long
long
letter
that
it
is
time
to
go
to
bed
need
i
say
that
i
have
often
spoken
of
you
to
doris
and
that
she
entreats
you
to
be
her
friend
as
well
as
mine
when
we
meet
again
in
england
darling
for
the
present
with
fondest
love
your
i
have
formed
a
new
habit
in
case
of
feeling
hungry
in
the
night
i
keep
a
box
of
chocolate
under
the
pillow
you
have
no
idea
what
a
comfort
it
is
if
i
ever
meet
with
the
man
who
fulfills
my
ideal
i
shall
make
it
a
condition
of
the
marriage
settlement
that
i
am
to
have
chocolate
under
the
chapter
xxi
polly
and
sally
without
a
care
to
trouble
her
abroad
or
at
home
finding
inexhaustible
varieties
of
amusement
seeing
new
places
making
new
acquaintances
what
a
disheartening
contrast
did
cecilia
s
happy
life
present
to
the
life
of
her
friend
who
in
emily
s
position
could
have
read
that
letter
from
switzerland
and
not
have
lost
heart
and
faith
for
the
moment
at
least
as
the
inevitable
result
a
buoyant
temperament
is
of
all
moral
qualities
the
most
precious
in
this
respect
it
is
the
one
force
in
us
when
virtuous
resolution
proves
insufficient
which
resists
by
instinct
the
stealthy
approaches
of
despair
i
shall
only
cry
emily
thought
if
i
stay
at
home
better
go
observant
persons
accustomed
to
frequent
the
london
parks
can
hardly
have
failed
to
notice
the
number
of
solitary
strangers
sadly
endeavoring
to
vary
their
lives
by
taking
a
walk
they
linger
about
the
they
sit
for
hours
on
the
benches
they
look
with
patient
curiosity
at
other
people
who
have
companions
they
notice
ladies
on
horseback
and
children
at
play
with
submissive
interest
some
of
the
men
find
company
in
a
pipe
without
appearing
to
enjoy
it
some
of
the
women
find
a
substitute
for
dinner
in
little
dry
biscuits
wrapped
in
crumpled
scraps
of
paper
they
are
not
sociable
they
are
hardly
ever
seen
to
make
acquaintance
with
each
other
perhaps
they
are
or
proud
or
sullen
perhaps
they
despair
of
others
being
accustomed
to
despair
of
themselves
perhaps
they
have
their
reasons
for
never
venturing
to
encounter
curiosity
or
their
vices
which
dread
detection
or
their
virtues
which
suffer
hardship
with
the
resignation
that
is
sufficient
for
itself
the
one
thing
certain
is
that
these
unfortunate
people
resist
discovery
we
know
that
they
are
strangers
in
london
and
we
know
no
more
and
emily
was
one
of
them
among
the
other
forlorn
wanderers
in
the
parks
there
appeared
latterly
a
trim
little
figure
in
black
with
the
face
protected
from
notice
behind
a
crape
veil
which
was
beginning
to
be
familiar
day
after
day
to
nursemaids
and
children
and
to
rouse
curiosity
among
harmless
solitaries
meditating
on
benches
and
idle
vagabonds
strolling
over
the
grass
the
whom
the
considerate
doctor
had
provided
was
the
one
person
in
emily
s
absence
left
to
take
care
of
the
house
there
was
no
other
creature
who
could
be
a
companion
to
the
friendless
girl
ellmother
had
never
shown
herself
again
since
the
funeral
mosey
could
not
forget
that
she
had
been
no
matter
how
politely
requested
to
withdraw
to
whom
could
emily
say
let
us
go
out
for
a
walk
she
had
communicated
the
news
of
her
aunt
s
death
to
miss
ladd
at
brighton
and
had
heard
from
francine
the
worthy
schoolmistress
had
written
to
her
with
the
truest
kindness
choose
your
own
time
my
poor
child
and
come
and
stay
with
me
at
brighton
the
sooner
the
emily
shrank
not
from
accepting
the
invitation
but
from
encountering
francine
the
hard
west
indian
heiress
looked
harder
than
ever
with
a
pen
in
her
hand
her
letter
announced
that
she
was
getting
on
wretchedly
with
her
studies
which
she
hated
she
found
the
masters
appointed
to
instruct
her
ugly
and
disagreeable
and
loathed
the
sight
of
them
she
had
taken
a
dislike
to
miss
ladd
and
time
only
confirmed
that
unfavorable
impression
brighton
was
always
the
same
the
sea
was
always
the
same
the
drives
were
always
the
same
francine
felt
a
presentiment
that
she
should
do
something
desperate
unless
emily
joined
her
and
made
brighton
endurable
behind
the
horrid
schoolmistress
s
solitude
in
london
was
a
privilege
and
a
pleasure
viewed
as
the
alternative
to
such
companionship
as
this
emily
wrote
gratefully
to
miss
ladd
and
asked
to
be
excused
other
days
had
passed
drearily
since
that
time
but
the
one
day
that
had
brought
with
it
cecilia
s
letter
set
past
happiness
and
present
sorrow
together
so
vividly
and
so
cruelly
that
emily
s
courage
sank
she
had
forced
back
the
tears
in
her
lonely
home
she
had
gone
out
to
seek
consolation
and
encouragement
under
the
sunny
sky
to
find
comfort
for
her
sore
heart
in
the
radiant
summer
beauty
of
flowers
and
grass
in
the
sweet
breathing
of
the
air
in
the
happy
heavenward
soaring
of
the
birds
no
mother
nature
is
stepmother
to
the
sick
at
heart
soon
too
soon
she
could
hardly
see
where
she
went
again
and
again
she
resolutely
cleared
her
eyes
under
the
shelter
of
her
veil
when
passing
strangers
noticed
her
and
again
and
again
the
tears
found
their
way
back
oh
if
the
girls
at
the
school
were
to
see
her
now
the
girls
who
used
to
say
in
their
moments
of
sadness
let
us
go
to
emily
and
be
cheered
would
they
know
her
again
she
sat
down
to
rest
and
recover
herself
on
the
nearest
bench
it
was
unoccupied
no
passing
footsteps
were
audible
on
the
remote
path
to
which
she
had
strayed
solitude
at
home
solitude
in
the
park
where
was
cecilia
at
that
moment
in
italy
among
the
lakes
and
mountains
happy
in
the
company
of
her
friend
the
lonely
interval
passed
and
persons
came
near
two
sisters
girls
like
herself
stopped
to
rest
on
the
bench
they
were
full
of
their
own
interests
they
hardly
looked
at
the
stranger
in
mourning
garments
the
younger
sister
was
to
be
married
and
the
elder
was
to
be
bridesmaid
they
talked
of
their
dresses
and
their
presents
they
compared
the
dashing
bridegroom
of
one
with
the
timid
lover
of
the
other
they
laughed
over
their
own
small
sallies
of
wit
over
their
joyous
dreams
of
the
future
over
their
opinions
of
the
guests
invited
to
the
wedding
too
joyfully
restless
to
remain
inactive
any
longer
they
jumped
up
again
from
the
seat
one
of
them
said
polly
i
m
too
happy
and
danced
as
she
walked
away
the
other
cried
sally
for
shame
and
laughed
as
if
she
had
hit
on
the
most
irresistible
joke
that
ever
was
made
emily
rose
and
went
home
by
some
mysterious
influence
which
she
was
unable
to
trace
the
boisterous
merriment
of
the
two
girls
had
roused
in
her
a
sense
of
revolt
against
the
life
that
she
was
leading
change
speedy
change
to
some
occupation
that
would
force
her
to
exert
herself
presented
the
one
promise
of
brighter
days
that
she
could
see
to
feel
this
was
to
be
inevitably
reminded
of
sir
jervis
redwood
here
was
a
man
who
had
never
seen
her
transformed
by
the
incomprehensible
operation
of
chance
into
the
friend
of
whom
she
stood
in
need
the
friend
who
pointed
the
way
to
a
new
world
of
action
the
busy
world
of
readers
in
the
library
of
the
museum
early
in
the
new
week
emily
had
accepted
sir
jervis
s
proposal
and
had
so
interested
the
bookseller
to
whom
she
had
been
directed
to
apply
that
he
took
it
on
himself
to
modify
the
arbitrary
instructions
of
his
employer
the
old
gentleman
has
no
mercy
on
himself
and
no
mercy
on
others
he
explained
where
his
literary
labors
are
concerned
you
must
spare
yourself
miss
emily
it
is
not
only
absurd
it
s
cruel
to
expect
you
to
ransack
old
newspapers
for
discoveries
in
yucatan
from
the
time
when
stephens
published
his
travels
in
central
america
nearly
forty
years
since
begin
with
back
numbers
published
within
a
few
years
say
five
years
from
the
present
date
and
let
us
see
what
your
search
over
that
interval
will
bring
accepting
this
friendly
advice
emily
began
with
the
dating
from
new
year
s
day
the
first
hour
of
her
search
strengthened
the
sincere
sense
of
gratitude
with
which
she
remembered
the
bookseller
s
kindness
to
keep
her
attention
steadily
fixed
on
the
one
subject
that
interested
her
employer
and
to
resist
the
temptation
to
read
those
miscellaneous
items
of
news
which
especially
interest
women
put
her
patience
and
resolution
to
a
merciless
test
happily
for
herself
her
neighbors
on
either
side
were
no
idlers
to
see
them
so
absorbed
over
their
work
that
they
never
once
looked
at
her
after
the
first
moment
when
she
took
her
place
between
them
was
to
find
exactly
the
example
of
which
she
stood
most
in
need
as
the
hours
wore
on
she
pursued
her
weary
way
down
one
column
and
up
another
resigned
at
least
if
not
quite
reconciled
yet
to
her
task
her
labors
ended
for
the
day
with
such
encouragement
as
she
might
derive
from
the
conviction
of
having
thus
far
honestly
pursued
a
useless
search
news
was
waiting
for
her
when
she
reached
home
which
raised
her
sinking
spirits
on
leaving
the
cottage
that
morning
she
had
given
certain
instructions
relating
to
the
modest
stranger
who
had
taken
charge
of
her
correspondence
in
case
of
his
paying
a
second
visit
during
her
absence
at
the
museum
the
first
words
spoken
by
the
servant
on
opening
the
door
informed
her
that
the
unknown
gentleman
had
called
again
this
time
he
had
boldly
left
his
card
there
was
the
welcome
name
that
she
had
expected
to
see
alban
morris
chapter
xxii
alban
morris
having
looked
at
the
card
emily
put
her
first
question
to
the
servant
did
you
tell
morris
what
your
orders
were
she
asked
yes
miss
i
said
i
was
to
have
shown
him
in
if
you
had
been
at
home
perhaps
i
did
wrong
i
told
him
what
you
told
me
when
you
went
out
this
morning
i
said
you
had
gone
to
read
at
the
what
makes
you
think
you
did
wrong
well
miss
he
didn
t
say
anything
but
he
looked
do
you
mean
that
he
looked
angry
the
servant
shook
her
head
not
exactly
angry
puzzled
and
put
did
he
leave
any
message
he
said
he
would
call
later
if
you
would
be
so
good
as
to
receive
in
half
an
hour
more
alban
and
emily
were
together
again
the
light
fell
full
on
her
face
as
she
rose
to
receive
him
oh
how
you
have
suffered
the
words
escaped
him
before
he
could
restrain
himself
he
looked
at
her
with
the
tender
sympathy
so
precious
to
women
which
she
had
not
seen
in
the
face
of
any
human
creature
since
the
loss
of
her
aunt
even
the
good
doctor
s
efforts
to
console
her
had
been
efforts
of
professional
routine
the
inevitable
result
of
his
familiarity
with
sorrow
and
death
while
alban
s
eyes
rested
on
her
emily
felt
her
tears
rising
in
the
fear
that
he
might
misinterpret
her
reception
of
him
she
made
an
effort
to
speak
with
some
appearance
of
composure
i
lead
a
lonely
life
she
said
and
i
can
well
understand
that
my
face
shows
it
you
are
one
of
my
very
few
friends
morris
the
tears
rose
again
it
discouraged
her
to
see
him
standing
irresolute
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
fearful
of
intruding
on
her
indeed
indeed
you
are
welcome
she
said
very
earnestly
in
those
sad
days
her
heart
was
easily
touched
she
gave
him
her
hand
for
the
second
time
he
held
it
gently
for
a
moment
every
day
since
they
had
parted
she
had
been
in
his
thoughts
she
had
become
dearer
to
him
than
ever
he
was
too
deeply
affected
to
trust
himself
to
answer
that
silence
pleaded
for
him
as
nothing
had
pleaded
for
him
yet
in
her
secret
self
she
remembered
with
wonder
how
she
had
received
his
confession
in
the
school
garden
it
was
a
little
hard
on
him
surely
to
have
forbidden
him
even
to
hope
conscious
of
her
own
weakness
even
while
giving
way
to
it
she
felt
the
necessity
of
turning
his
attention
from
herself
in
some
confusion
she
pointed
to
a
chair
at
her
side
and
spoke
of
his
first
visit
when
he
had
left
her
letters
at
the
door
having
confided
to
him
all
that
she
had
discovered
and
all
that
she
had
guessed
on
that
occasion
it
was
by
an
easy
transition
that
she
alluded
next
to
the
motive
for
his
journey
to
the
north
i
thought
it
might
be
suspicion
of
rook
she
said
was
i
mistaken
no
you
were
they
were
serious
suspicions
i
suppose
certainly
i
should
not
otherwise
have
devoted
my
to
clearing
them
may
i
know
what
they
were
i
am
sorry
to
disappoint
you
he
began
but
you
would
rather
not
answer
my
question
she
interposed
i
would
rather
hear
you
tell
me
if
you
have
made
any
other
one
more
morris
i
guessed
that
you
had
become
acquainted
with
sir
jervis
for
the
second
time
miss
emily
you
have
arrived
at
a
sound
conclusion
my
one
hope
of
finding
opportunities
for
observing
sir
jervis
s
housekeeper
depended
on
my
chance
of
gaining
admission
to
sir
jervis
s
how
did
you
succeed
perhaps
you
provided
yourself
with
a
letter
of
introduction
i
knew
nobody
who
could
introduce
me
alban
replied
as
the
event
proved
a
letter
would
have
been
needless
sir
jervis
introduced
himself
and
more
wonderful
still
he
invited
me
to
his
house
at
our
first
sir
jervis
introduced
himself
emily
repeated
in
amazement
from
cecilia
s
description
of
him
i
should
have
thought
he
was
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
do
that
alban
smiled
and
you
would
like
to
know
how
it
happened
he
suggested
the
very
favor
i
was
going
to
ask
of
you
she
replied
instead
of
at
once
complying
with
her
wishes
he
paused
hesitated
and
made
a
strange
request
will
you
forgive
my
rudeness
if
i
ask
leave
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
while
i
talk
i
am
a
restless
man
walking
up
and
down
helps
me
to
express
myself
her
f
ace
brightened
for
the
first
time
how
like
you
that
is
she
exclaimed
alban
looked
at
her
with
surprise
and
delight
she
had
betrayed
an
interest
in
studying
his
character
which
he
appreciated
at
its
full
value
i
should
never
have
dared
to
hope
he
said
that
you
knew
me
so
well
you
are
forgetting
your
story
she
reminded
him
he
moved
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
where
there
were
fewer
impediments
in
the
shape
of
furniture
with
his
head
down
and
his
hands
crossed
behind
him
he
paced
to
and
fro
habit
made
him
express
himself
in
his
usual
quaint
way
but
he
became
embarrassed
as
he
went
on
was
he
disturbed
by
his
recollections
or
by
the
fear
of
taking
emily
into
his
confidence
too
freely
different
people
have
different
ways
of
telling
a
story
he
said
mine
is
the
methodical
way
i
begin
at
the
beginning
we
will
start
if
you
please
in
the
railway
we
will
proceed
in
a
chaise
and
we
will
stop
at
a
village
situated
in
a
hole
it
was
the
nearest
place
to
sir
jervis
s
house
and
it
was
therefore
my
destination
i
picked
out
the
biggest
of
the
cottages
i
mean
the
huts
and
asked
the
woman
at
the
door
if
she
had
a
bed
to
let
she
evidently
thought
me
either
mad
or
drunk
i
wasted
no
time
in
persuasion
the
right
person
to
plead
my
cause
was
asleep
in
her
arms
i
began
by
admiring
the
baby
and
i
ended
by
taking
the
baby
s
portrait
from
that
moment
i
became
a
member
of
the
family
the
member
who
had
his
own
way
besides
the
room
occupied
by
the
husband
and
wife
there
was
a
sort
of
kennel
in
which
the
husband
s
brother
slept
he
was
dismissed
with
five
shillings
of
mine
to
comfort
him
to
find
shelter
somewhere
else
and
i
was
promoted
to
the
vacant
place
it
is
my
misfortune
to
be
tall
when
i
went
to
bed
i
slept
with
my
head
on
the
pillow
and
my
feet
out
of
the
window
very
cool
and
pleasant
in
summer
weather
the
next
morning
i
set
my
trap
for
sir
your
trap
emily
repeated
wondering
what
he
meant
i
went
out
to
sketch
from
nature
alban
continued
can
anybody
with
or
without
a
title
i
don
t
care
living
in
a
lonely
country
house
see
a
stranger
hard
at
work
with
a
and
brushes
and
not
stop
to
look
at
what
he
is
doing
three
days
passed
and
nothing
happened
i
was
quite
patient
the
grand
open
country
all
round
me
offered
lessons
of
inestimable
value
in
what
we
call
aerial
perspective
on
the
fourth
day
i
was
absorbed
over
the
hardest
of
all
hard
tasks
in
landscape
art
studying
the
clouds
straight
from
nature
the
magnificent
moorland
silence
was
suddenly
profaned
by
a
man
s
voice
speaking
or
rather
croaking
behind
me
the
worst
curse
of
human
life
the
voice
said
is
the
detestable
necessity
of
taking
exercise
i
hate
losing
my
time
i
hate
fine
scenery
i
hate
fresh
air
i
hate
a
pony
go
on
you
brute
being
too
deeply
engaged
with
the
clouds
to
look
round
i
had
supposed
this
pretty
speech
to
be
addressed
to
some
second
person
nothing
of
the
sort
the
croaking
voice
had
a
habit
of
speaking
to
itself
in
a
minute
more
there
came
within
my
range
of
view
a
solitary
old
man
mounted
on
a
rough
was
it
sir
jervis
alban
hesitated
it
looked
more
like
the
popular
notion
of
the
devil
he
said
oh
morris
i
give
you
my
first
impression
miss
emily
for
what
it
is
worth
he
had
his
hat
in
his
hand
to
keep
his
head
cool
his
wiry
hair
looked
like
hair
standing
on
end
his
bushy
eyebrows
curled
upward
toward
his
narrow
temples
his
horrid
old
globular
eyes
stared
with
a
wicked
brightness
his
pointed
beard
hid
his
chin
he
was
covered
from
his
throat
to
his
ankles
in
a
loose
black
garment
something
between
a
coat
and
a
cloak
and
to
complete
him
he
had
a
club
foot
i
don
t
doubt
that
sir
jervis
redwood
is
the
earthly
alias
which
he
finds
convenient
but
i
stick
to
that
first
impression
which
appeared
to
surprise
you
ha
an
artist
you
seem
to
be
the
sort
of
man
i
want
in
those
terms
he
introduced
himself
observe
if
you
please
that
my
trap
caught
him
the
moment
he
came
my
way
who
wouldn
t
be
an
artist
did
he
take
a
liking
to
you
emily
inquired
not
he
i
don
t
believe
he
ever
took
a
liking
to
anybody
in
his
then
how
did
you
get
your
invitation
to
his
house
that
s
the
amusing
part
of
it
miss
emily
give
me
a
little
breathing
time
and
you
shall
chapter
xxiii
miss
redwood
i
got
invited
to
sir
jervis
s
house
alban
resumed
by
treating
the
old
savage
as
unceremoniously
as
he
had
treated
me
that
s
an
idle
trade
of
yours
he
said
looking
at
my
sketch
other
ignorant
people
have
made
the
same
remark
i
answered
he
rode
away
as
if
he
was
not
used
to
be
spoken
to
in
that
manner
and
then
thought
better
of
it
and
came
back
do
you
understand
wood
engraving
he
asked
and
etching
i
have
practiced
etching
are
you
a
royal
academician
i
m
a
at
a
ladies
whose
school
miss
ladd
damn
it
you
know
the
girl
who
ought
to
have
been
my
i
am
not
quite
sure
whether
you
will
take
it
as
a
compliment
sir
jervis
appeared
to
view
you
in
the
light
of
a
reference
to
my
respectability
at
any
rate
he
went
on
with
his
questions
how
long
do
you
stop
in
these
parts
i
haven
t
made
up
my
look
here
i
want
to
consult
you
are
you
listening
no
i
m
he
burst
into
a
horrid
scream
i
asked
if
he
felt
himself
taken
ill
he
said
i
m
it
was
a
diabolical
laugh
in
one
syllable
not
ha
ha
ha
only
ha
and
it
made
him
look
wonderfully
like
that
eminent
person
whom
i
persist
in
thinking
he
resembles
you
re
an
impudent
dog
he
said
where
are
you
living
he
was
so
delighted
when
he
heard
of
my
uncomfortable
position
in
the
that
he
offered
his
hospitality
on
the
spot
i
can
t
go
to
you
in
such
a
pigstye
as
that
he
said
you
must
come
to
me
what
s
your
name
alban
morris
what
s
yours
jervis
redwood
pack
up
your
traps
when
you
ve
done
your
job
and
come
and
try
my
kennel
there
it
is
in
a
corner
of
your
drawing
and
devilish
like
i
packed
up
my
traps
and
i
tried
his
kennel
and
now
you
have
had
enough
of
sir
jervis
not
half
enough
emily
answered
your
story
leaves
off
just
at
the
interesting
moment
i
want
you
to
take
me
to
sir
jervis
s
and
i
want
you
miss
emily
to
take
me
to
the
british
museum
don
t
let
me
startle
you
when
i
called
here
earlier
in
the
day
i
was
told
that
you
had
gone
to
the
is
your
reading
a
secret
his
manner
when
he
made
that
reply
suggested
to
emily
that
there
was
some
foregone
conclusion
in
his
mind
which
he
was
putting
to
the
test
she
answered
without
alluding
to
the
impression
which
he
had
produced
on
her
my
reading
is
no
secret
i
am
only
consulting
old
he
repeated
the
last
words
to
himself
old
newspapers
he
said
as
if
he
was
not
quite
sure
of
having
rightly
understood
her
she
tried
to
help
him
by
a
more
definite
reply
i
am
looking
through
old
newspapers
she
resumed
beginning
with
the
year
eighteen
hundred
and
and
going
back
from
that
time
he
asked
eagerly
to
earlier
dates
still
no
just
the
contrary
advancing
from
to
the
present
he
suddenly
turned
pale
and
tried
to
hide
his
face
from
her
by
looking
out
of
the
window
for
a
moment
his
agitation
deprived
him
of
his
presence
of
mind
in
that
moment
she
saw
that
she
had
alarmed
him
what
have
i
said
to
frighten
you
she
asked
he
tried
to
assume
a
tone
of
commonplace
gallantry
there
are
limits
even
to
your
power
over
me
he
replied
whatever
else
you
may
do
you
can
never
frighten
me
are
you
searching
those
old
newspapers
with
any
particular
object
in
view
may
i
know
what
it
is
may
i
know
why
i
frightened
you
he
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
again
then
checked
himself
abruptly
and
appealed
to
her
mercy
don
t
be
hard
on
me
he
pleaded
i
am
so
fond
of
you
oh
forgive
me
i
only
mean
that
it
distresses
me
to
have
any
concealments
from
you
if
i
could
open
my
whole
heart
at
this
moment
i
should
be
a
happier
she
understood
him
and
believed
him
my
curiosity
shall
never
embarrass
you
again
she
answered
warmly
i
won
t
even
remember
that
i
wanted
to
hear
how
you
got
on
in
sir
jervis
s
his
gratitude
seized
the
opportunity
of
taking
her
harmlessly
into
his
confidence
as
sir
jervis
s
guest
he
said
my
experience
is
at
your
service
only
tell
me
how
i
can
interest
she
replied
with
some
hesitation
i
should
like
to
know
what
happened
when
you
first
saw
to
her
surprise
and
relief
he
at
once
complied
with
her
wishes
we
met
he
said
on
the
evening
when
i
first
entered
the
house
sir
jervis
took
me
into
the
and
there
sat
miss
redwood
with
a
large
black
cat
on
her
lap
older
than
her
brother
taller
than
her
brother
leaner
than
her
brother
with
strange
stony
eyes
and
a
skin
like
parchment
she
looked
if
i
may
speak
in
contradictions
like
a
living
corpse
i
was
presented
and
the
corpse
revived
the
last
lingering
relics
of
former
good
breeding
showed
themselves
faintly
in
her
brow
and
in
her
smile
you
will
hear
more
of
miss
redwood
presently
in
the
meanwhile
sir
jervis
made
me
reward
his
hospitality
by
professional
advice
he
wished
me
to
decide
whether
the
artists
whom
he
had
employed
to
illustrate
his
wonderful
book
had
cheated
him
by
overcharges
and
bad
work
and
rook
was
sent
to
fetch
the
engravings
from
his
study
upstairs
you
remember
her
petrified
appearance
when
she
first
read
the
inscription
on
your
locket
the
same
result
followed
when
she
found
herself
face
to
face
with
me
i
saluted
her
civilly
she
was
deaf
and
blind
to
my
politeness
her
master
snatched
the
illustrations
out
of
her
hand
and
told
her
to
leave
the
room
she
stood
stockstill
staring
helplessly
sir
jervis
looked
round
at
his
sister
and
i
followed
his
example
miss
redwood
was
observing
the
housekeeper
too
attentively
to
notice
anything
else
her
brother
was
obliged
to
speak
to
her
try
rook
with
the
bell
he
said
miss
redwood
took
a
fine
old
bronze
from
the
table
at
her
side
and
rang
it
at
the
shrill
silvery
sound
of
the
bell
rook
put
her
hand
to
her
head
as
if
the
ringing
had
hurt
her
turned
instantly
and
left
us
nobody
can
manage
rook
but
my
sister
sir
jervis
explained
rook
is
miss
redwood
differed
with
him
no
she
said
only
one
word
but
there
were
volumes
of
contradiction
in
it
sir
jervis
looked
at
me
slyly
meaning
perhaps
that
he
thought
his
sister
crazy
too
the
dinner
was
brought
in
at
the
same
moment
and
my
attention
was
diverted
to
rook
s
what
was
he
like
emily
asked
i
really
can
t
tell
you
he
was
one
of
those
essentially
commonplace
persons
whom
one
never
looks
at
a
second
time
his
dress
was
shabby
his
head
was
bald
and
his
hands
shook
when
he
waited
on
us
at
table
and
that
is
all
i
remember
sir
jervis
and
i
feasted
on
salt
fish
mutton
and
beer
miss
redwood
had
cold
broth
with
a
full
of
rum
poured
into
it
by
rook
she
s
got
no
stomach
her
brother
informed
me
hot
things
come
up
again
ten
minutes
after
they
have
gone
down
her
throat
she
lives
on
that
beastly
mixture
and
calls
it
miss
redwood
sipped
her
elixir
of
life
and
occasionally
looked
at
me
with
an
appearance
of
interest
which
i
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
dinner
being
over
she
rang
her
antique
bell
the
shabby
old
answered
her
call
where
s
your
wife
she
inquired
ill
she
took
rook
s
arm
to
go
out
and
stopped
as
she
passed
me
come
to
my
room
if
you
please
sir
at
two
o
clock
she
said
sir
jervis
explained
again
she
s
all
to
pieces
in
the
morning
he
invariably
called
his
sister
she
and
gets
patched
up
toward
the
middle
of
the
day
death
has
forgotten
her
that
s
about
the
truth
of
he
lighted
his
pipe
and
pondered
over
the
hieroglyphics
found
among
the
ruined
cities
of
yucatan
i
lighted
my
pipe
and
read
the
only
book
i
could
find
in
the
a
dreadful
record
of
shipwrecks
and
disasters
at
sea
when
the
room
was
full
of
we
fell
asleep
in
our
chairs
and
when
we
awoke
again
we
got
up
and
went
to
bed
there
is
the
true
story
of
my
first
evening
at
redwood
emily
begged
him
to
go
on
you
have
interested
me
in
miss
redwood
she
said
you
kept
your
appointment
of
course
i
kept
my
appointment
in
no
very
pleasant
humor
encouraged
by
my
favorable
report
of
the
illustrations
which
he
had
submitted
to
my
judgment
sir
jervis
proposed
to
make
me
useful
to
him
in
a
new
capacity
you
have
nothing
particular
to
do
he
said
suppose
you
clean
my
pictures
i
gave
him
one
of
my
black
looks
and
made
no
other
reply
my
interview
with
his
sister
tried
my
powers
of
in
another
way
miss
redwood
declared
her
purpose
in
sending
for
me
the
moment
i
entered
the
room
without
any
preliminary
remarks
speaking
slowly
and
emphatically
in
a
wonderfully
strong
voice
for
a
woman
of
her
age
she
said
i
have
a
favor
to
ask
of
you
sir
i
want
you
to
tell
me
what
rook
has
i
was
so
staggered
that
i
stared
at
her
like
a
fool
she
went
on
i
suspected
rook
sir
of
having
guilty
remembrances
on
her
conscience
before
she
had
been
a
week
in
our
can
you
imagine
my
astonishment
when
i
heard
that
miss
redwood
s
view
of
rook
was
my
view
finding
that
i
still
said
nothing
the
old
lady
entered
into
details
we
arranged
sir
she
persisted
in
calling
me
sir
with
the
formal
politeness
of
the
old
school
we
arranged
sir
that
rook
and
her
husband
should
occupy
the
bedroom
next
to
mine
so
that
i
might
have
her
near
me
in
case
of
my
being
taken
ill
in
the
night
she
looked
at
the
door
between
the
two
rooms
suspicious
she
asked
if
there
was
any
objection
to
her
changing
to
another
room
suspicious
suspicious
pray
take
a
seat
sir
and
tell
me
which
rook
is
guilty
of
theft
or
murder
what
a
dreadful
old
woman
emily
exclaimed
how
did
you
answer
her
i
told
her
with
perfect
truth
that
i
knew
nothing
of
rook
s
secrets
miss
redwood
s
humor
took
a
satirical
turn
allow
me
to
ask
sir
whether
your
eyes
were
shut
when
our
housekeeper
found
herself
unexpectedly
in
your
presence
i
referred
the
old
lady
to
her
brother
s
opinion
sir
jervis
believes
rook
to
be
crazy
i
reminded
her
do
you
refuse
to
trust
me
sir
i
have
no
information
to
give
you
she
waved
her
skinny
old
hand
in
the
direction
of
the
door
i
made
my
bow
and
retired
she
called
me
back
old
women
used
to
be
prophets
sir
in
the
bygone
time
she
said
i
will
venture
on
a
prediction
you
will
be
the
means
of
depriving
us
of
the
services
of
and
rook
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
stay
here
a
day
or
two
longer
you
will
hear
that
those
two
people
have
given
us
notice
to
quit
it
will
be
her
doing
mind
he
is
a
mere
cypher
i
wish
you
will
you
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
that
the
prophecy
was
fulfilled
do
you
mean
that
they
actually
left
the
house
they
would
certainly
have
left
the
house
alban
answered
if
sir
jervis
had
not
insisted
on
receiving
the
customary
month
s
warning
he
asserted
his
resolution
by
locking
up
the
old
husband
in
the
pantry
his
sister
s
suspicions
never
entered
his
head
the
housekeeper
s
conduct
he
said
simply
proved
that
she
was
what
he
had
always
considered
her
to
be
crazy
a
capital
servant
in
spite
of
that
drawback
he
remarked
and
you
will
see
i
shall
bring
her
to
her
the
impression
produced
on
me
was
naturally
of
a
very
different
kind
while
i
was
still
uncertain
how
to
entrap
rook
into
confirming
my
suspicions
she
herself
had
saved
me
the
trouble
she
had
placed
her
own
guilty
interpretation
on
my
appearance
in
the
house
i
had
driven
her
away
emily
remained
true
to
her
resolution
not
to
let
her
curiosity
embarrass
alban
again
but
the
unexpressed
question
was
in
her
thoughts
of
what
guilt
does
he
suspect
rook
and
when
he
first
felt
his
suspicions
was
my
father
in
his
mind
alban
proceeded
i
had
only
to
consider
next
whether
i
could
hope
to
make
any
further
discoveries
if
i
continued
to
be
sir
jervis
s
guest
the
object
of
my
journey
had
been
gained
and
i
had
no
desire
to
be
employed
as
miss
redwood
assisted
me
in
arriving
at
a
decision
i
was
sent
for
to
speak
to
her
again
the
success
of
her
prophecy
had
raised
her
spirits
she
asked
with
ironical
humility
if
i
proposed
to
honor
them
by
still
remaining
their
guest
after
the
disturbance
that
i
had
provoked
i
answered
that
i
proposed
to
leave
by
the
first
train
the
next
morning
will
it
be
convenient
for
you
to
travel
to
some
place
at
a
good
distance
from
this
part
of
the
world
she
asked
i
had
my
own
reasons
for
going
to
london
and
said
so
will
you
mention
that
to
my
brother
this
evening
just
before
we
sit
down
to
dinner
she
continued
and
will
you
tell
him
plainly
that
you
have
no
intention
of
returning
to
the
north
i
shall
make
use
of
rook
s
arm
as
usual
to
help
me
downstairs
and
i
will
take
care
that
she
hears
what
you
say
without
venturing
on
another
prophecy
i
will
only
hint
to
you
that
i
have
my
own
idea
of
what
will
happen
and
i
should
like
you
to
see
for
yourself
sir
whether
my
anticipations
are
need
i
tell
you
that
this
strange
old
woman
proved
to
be
right
once
more
rook
was
released
rook
made
humble
apologies
and
laid
the
whole
blame
on
her
husband
s
temper
and
sir
jervis
bade
me
remark
that
his
method
had
succeeded
in
bringing
the
housekeeper
to
her
senses
such
were
the
results
produced
by
the
announcement
of
my
departure
for
london
purposely
made
in
rook
s
hearing
do
you
agree
with
me
that
my
journey
to
northumberland
has
not
been
taken
in
vain
once
more
emily
felt
the
necessity
of
controlling
herself
alban
had
said
that
he
had
reasons
of
his
own
for
going
to
could
she
venture
to
ask
him
what
those
reasons
were
she
could
only
persist
in
restraining
her
curiosity
and
conclude
that
he
would
have
mentioned
his
motive
if
it
had
been
as
she
had
at
one
time
supposed
connected
with
herself
it
was
a
wise
decision
no
earthly
consideration
would
have
induced
alban
to
answer
her
if
she
had
put
the
question
to
him
all
doubt
of
the
correctness
of
his
own
first
impression
was
now
at
an
end
he
was
convinced
that
rook
had
been
an
accomplice
in
the
crime
committed
in
at
the
village
inn
his
object
in
traveling
to
london
was
to
consult
the
newspaper
narrative
of
the
murder
he
too
had
been
one
of
the
readers
at
the
museum
had
examined
the
back
numbers
of
the
newspaper
and
had
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
emily
s
father
had
been
the
victim
of
the
crime
unless
he
found
means
to
prevent
it
her
course
of
reading
would
take
her
from
the
year
to
the
year
and
under
that
date
she
would
see
the
fatal
report
heading
the
top
of
a
column
and
printed
in
conspicuous
type
in
the
meanwhile
emily
had
broken
the
silence
before
it
could
lead
to
embarrassing
results
by
asking
if
alban
had
seen
rook
again
on
the
morning
when
he
left
sir
jervis
s
house
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
seeing
her
alban
replied
now
that
she
and
her
husband
had
decided
to
remain
at
redwood
hall
i
knew
where
to
find
her
in
case
of
necessity
as
it
happened
i
saw
nobody
on
the
morning
of
my
departure
but
sir
jervis
himself
he
still
held
to
his
idea
of
having
his
pictures
cleaned
for
nothing
if
you
can
t
do
it
yourself
he
said
couldn
t
you
teach
my
secretary
he
described
the
lady
whom
he
had
engaged
in
your
place
as
a
nasty
woman
with
a
perpetual
cold
in
her
at
the
same
time
he
remarked
he
was
a
friend
to
the
women
because
he
got
them
i
declined
to
teach
the
unfortunate
secretary
the
art
of
finding
me
determined
sir
jervis
was
quite
ready
to
say
but
he
made
use
of
me
to
the
last
he
employed
me
as
postman
and
saved
a
stamp
the
letter
addressed
to
you
arrived
at
sir
jervis
said
you
are
going
to
london
suppose
you
take
it
with
you
did
he
tell
you
that
there
was
a
letter
of
his
own
inclosed
in
the
envelope
no
when
he
gave
me
the
envelope
it
was
already
emily
at
once
handed
to
him
sir
jervis
s
letter
that
will
tell
you
who
employs
me
at
the
museum
and
what
my
work
is
she
said
he
looked
through
the
letter
and
at
once
offered
eagerly
offered
to
help
her
i
have
been
a
student
in
the
at
intervals
for
years
past
he
said
let
me
assist
you
and
i
shall
have
something
to
do
in
my
holiday
he
was
so
anxious
to
be
of
use
that
he
interrupted
her
before
she
could
thank
him
let
us
take
alternate
years
he
suggested
did
you
not
tell
me
you
were
searching
the
newspapers
published
in
eighteen
hundred
and
very
well
i
will
take
the
next
year
you
will
take
the
year
after
and
so
you
are
very
kind
she
answered
but
i
should
like
to
propose
an
improvement
on
your
what
improvement
he
asked
rather
sharply
if
you
will
leave
the
five
years
from
to
entirely
to
me
she
resumed
and
take
the
next
five
years
reckoning
from
you
will
help
me
to
better
purpose
sir
jervis
expects
me
to
look
for
reports
of
central
american
explorations
through
the
newspapers
of
the
last
forty
years
and
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
limiting
the
heavy
task
imposed
on
me
when
i
report
my
progress
to
my
employer
i
should
like
to
say
that
i
have
got
through
ten
years
of
the
examination
instead
of
five
do
you
see
any
objection
to
the
arrangement
i
propose
he
proved
to
be
obstinate
incomprehensibly
obstinate
let
us
try
my
plan
to
begin
with
he
insisted
while
you
are
looking
through
let
me
be
at
work
on
if
you
still
prefer
your
own
arrangement
after
that
i
will
follow
your
suggestion
with
pleasure
is
it
agreed
her
acute
perception
enlightened
by
his
tone
as
wall
as
by
his
words
detected
something
under
the
surface
already
it
isn
t
agreed
until
i
understand
you
a
little
better
she
quietly
replied
i
fancy
you
have
some
object
of
your
own
in
she
spoke
with
her
usual
directness
of
look
and
manner
he
was
evidently
disconcerted
what
makes
you
think
so
he
asked
my
own
experience
of
myself
makes
me
think
so
she
answered
if
had
some
object
to
gain
i
should
persist
in
carrying
it
out
like
does
that
mean
miss
emily
that
you
refuse
to
give
way
no
morris
i
have
made
myself
disagreeable
but
i
know
when
to
stop
i
trust
you
and
if
he
had
been
less
deeply
interested
in
the
accomplishment
of
his
merciful
design
he
might
have
viewed
emily
s
sudden
submission
with
some
distrust
as
it
was
his
eagerness
to
prevent
her
from
discovering
the
narrative
of
the
murder
hurried
him
into
an
act
of
indiscretion
he
made
an
excuse
to
leave
her
immediately
in
the
fear
that
she
might
change
her
mind
i
have
inexcusably
prolonged
my
visit
he
said
if
i
presume
on
your
kindness
in
this
way
how
can
i
hope
that
you
will
receive
me
again
we
meet
in
the
he
hastened
away
as
if
he
was
afraid
to
let
her
say
a
word
in
reply
emily
reflected
is
there
something
he
doesn
t
want
me
to
see
in
the
news
of
the
year
the
one
explanation
which
suggested
itself
to
her
mind
assumed
that
form
of
expression
and
the
one
method
of
satisfying
her
curiosity
that
seemed
likely
to
succeed
was
to
search
the
volume
which
alban
had
reserved
for
his
own
reading
for
two
days
they
pursued
their
task
together
seated
at
opposite
desks
on
the
third
day
emily
was
absent
was
she
ill
she
was
at
the
library
in
the
city
consulting
the
file
of
for
the
year
chapter
xxiv
rook
emily
s
first
day
in
the
city
library
proved
to
be
a
day
wasted
she
began
reading
the
back
numbers
of
the
newspaper
at
haphazard
without
any
definite
idea
of
what
she
was
looking
for
conscious
of
the
error
into
which
her
own
impatience
had
led
her
she
was
at
a
loss
how
to
retrace
the
false
step
that
she
had
taken
but
two
alternatives
presented
themselves
either
to
abandon
the
hope
of
making
any
discovery
or
to
attempt
to
penetrate
alban
s
motives
by
means
of
pure
guesswork
pursued
in
the
dark
how
was
the
problem
to
be
solved
this
serious
question
troubled
her
all
through
the
evening
and
kept
her
awake
when
she
went
to
bed
in
despair
of
her
capacity
to
remove
the
obstacle
that
stood
in
her
way
she
decided
on
resuming
her
regular
work
at
the
museum
turned
her
pillow
to
get
at
the
cool
side
of
it
and
made
up
her
mind
to
go
asleep
in
the
case
of
the
wiser
animals
the
person
submits
to
sleep
it
is
only
the
superior
human
being
who
tries
the
hopeless
experiment
of
making
sleep
submit
to
the
person
wakeful
on
the
warm
side
of
the
pillow
emily
remained
wakeful
on
the
cool
side
thinking
again
and
again
of
the
interview
with
alban
which
had
ended
so
strangely
little
by
little
her
mind
passed
the
limits
which
had
restrained
it
thus
far
alban
s
conduct
in
keeping
his
secret
in
the
matter
of
the
newspapers
now
began
to
associate
itself
with
alban
s
conduct
in
keeping
that
other
secret
which
concealed
from
her
his
suspicions
of
rook
she
started
up
in
bed
as
the
next
possibility
occurred
to
her
in
speaking
of
the
disaster
which
had
compelled
and
rook
to
close
the
inn
cecilia
had
alluded
to
an
inquest
held
on
the
body
of
the
murdered
man
had
the
inquest
been
mentioned
in
the
newspapers
at
the
time
and
had
alban
seen
something
in
the
report
which
concerned
rook
led
by
the
new
light
that
had
fallen
on
her
emily
returned
to
the
library
the
next
morning
with
a
definite
idea
of
what
she
had
to
look
for
incapable
of
giving
exact
dates
cecilia
had
informed
her
that
the
crime
was
committed
in
the
the
month
to
choose
in
beginning
her
examination
was
therefore
the
month
of
august
no
discovery
rewarded
her
she
tried
september
next
with
the
same
unsatisfactory
results
on
monday
the
first
of
october
she
met
with
some
encouragement
at
last
at
the
top
of
a
column
appeared
a
telegraphic
summary
of
all
that
was
then
known
of
the
crime
in
the
number
for
the
wednesday
following
she
found
a
full
report
of
the
proceedings
at
the
inquest
passing
over
the
preliminary
remarks
emily
read
the
evidence
with
the
closest
attention
the
jury
having
viewed
the
body
and
having
visited
an
outhouse
in
which
the
murder
had
been
committed
the
first
witness
called
was
benjamin
rook
landlord
of
the
inn
on
the
evening
of
sunday
september
two
gentlemen
presented
themselves
at
rook
s
house
under
circumstances
which
especially
excited
his
attention
the
youngest
of
the
two
was
short
and
of
fair
complexion
he
carried
a
knapsack
like
a
gentleman
on
a
pedestrian
excursion
his
manners
were
pleasant
and
he
was
decidedly
his
companion
older
taller
and
darker
and
a
finer
man
altogether
leaned
on
his
arm
and
seemed
to
be
exhausted
in
every
respect
they
were
singularly
unlike
each
other
the
younger
stranger
excepting
little
was
clean
shaved
the
elder
wore
his
whole
beard
not
knowing
their
names
the
landlord
distinguished
them
at
the
coroner
s
suggestion
as
the
fair
gentleman
and
the
dark
gentleman
it
was
raining
when
the
two
arrived
at
the
inn
there
were
signs
in
the
heavens
of
a
stormy
night
on
accosting
the
landlord
the
fair
gentleman
volunteered
the
following
statement
approaching
the
village
he
had
been
startled
by
seeing
the
dark
gentleman
a
total
stranger
to
him
stretched
prostrate
on
the
grass
at
the
roadside
so
far
as
he
could
judge
in
a
swoon
having
a
flask
with
brandy
in
it
he
revived
the
fainting
man
and
led
him
to
the
inn
this
statement
was
confirmed
by
a
laborer
who
was
on
his
way
to
the
village
at
the
time
the
dark
gentleman
endeavored
to
explain
what
had
happened
to
him
he
had
as
he
supposed
allowed
too
long
a
time
to
pass
after
an
early
breakfast
that
morning
without
taking
food
he
could
only
attribute
the
fainting
fit
to
that
cause
he
was
not
liable
to
fainting
fits
what
purpose
if
any
had
brought
him
into
the
neighborhood
of
zeeland
he
did
not
state
he
had
no
intention
of
remaining
at
the
inn
except
for
refreshment
and
he
asked
for
a
carriage
to
take
him
to
the
railway
station
the
fair
gentleman
seeing
the
signs
of
bad
weather
desired
to
remain
in
rook
s
house
for
the
night
and
proposed
to
resume
his
walking
tour
the
next
day
excepting
the
case
of
supper
which
could
be
easily
provided
the
landlord
had
no
choice
but
to
disappoint
both
his
guests
in
his
small
way
of
business
none
of
his
customers
wanted
to
hire
a
carriage
even
if
he
could
have
afforded
to
keep
one
as
for
beds
the
few
rooms
which
the
inn
contained
were
all
engaged
including
even
the
room
occupied
by
himself
and
his
wife
an
exhibition
of
agricultural
implements
had
been
opened
in
the
neighborhood
only
two
days
since
and
a
public
competition
between
rival
machines
was
to
be
decided
on
the
coming
monday
not
only
was
the
inn
crowded
but
even
the
accommodation
offered
by
the
nearest
town
had
proved
barely
sufficient
to
meet
the
public
demand
the
gentlemen
looked
at
each
other
and
agreed
that
there
was
no
help
for
it
but
to
hurry
the
supper
and
walk
to
the
railway
station
a
distance
of
between
five
and
six
miles
in
time
to
catch
the
last
train
while
the
meal
was
being
prepared
the
rain
held
off
for
a
while
the
dark
man
asked
his
way
to
the
and
went
out
by
himself
he
came
back
in
about
ten
minutes
and
sat
down
afterward
to
supper
with
his
companion
neither
the
landlord
nor
any
other
person
in
the
public
room
noticed
any
change
in
him
on
his
return
he
was
a
grave
quiet
sort
of
person
and
unlike
the
other
one
not
much
of
a
talker
as
the
darkness
came
on
the
rain
fell
again
heavily
and
the
heavens
were
black
a
flash
of
lightning
startled
the
gentlemen
when
they
went
to
the
window
to
look
out
the
thunderstorm
began
it
was
simply
impossible
that
two
strangers
to
the
neighborhood
could
find
their
way
to
the
station
through
storm
and
darkness
in
time
to
catch
the
train
with
or
without
bedrooms
they
must
remain
at
the
inn
for
the
night
having
already
given
up
their
own
room
to
their
lodgers
the
landlord
and
landlady
had
no
other
place
to
sleep
in
than
the
kitchen
next
to
the
kitchen
and
communicating
with
it
by
a
door
was
an
outhouse
used
partly
as
a
scullery
partly
as
a
there
was
an
old
among
the
lumber
on
which
one
of
the
gentlemen
might
rest
a
mattress
on
the
floor
could
be
provided
for

adding
a
table
and
a
basin
for
the
purposes
of
the
toilet
the
accommodation
which
rook
was
able
to
offer
came
to
an
end
the
travelers
agreed
to
occupy
this
makeshift
the
thunderstorm
passed
away
but
the
rain
continued
to
fall
heavily
soon
after
eleven
the
guests
at
the
inn
retired
for
the
night
there
was
some
little
discussion
between
the
two
travelers
as
to
which
of
them
should
take
possession
of
the
it
was
put
an
end
to
by
the
fair
gentleman
in
his
own
pleasant
way
he
proposed
to
toss
up
for
it
and
he
lost
the
dark
gentleman
went
to
bed
first
the
fair
gentleman
followed
after
waiting
a
while
rook
took
his
knapsack
into
the
outhouse
and
arranged
on
the
table
his
appliances
for
the
toilet
contained
in
a
leather
roll
and
including
a
razor
ready
for
use
in
the
morning
having
previously
barred
the
second
door
of
the
outhouse
which
led
into
the
yard
rook
fastened
the
other
door
the
lock
and
bolts
of
which
were
on
the
side
of
the
kitchen
he
then
secured
the
house
door
and
the
shutters
over
the
lower
windows
returning
to
the
kitchen
he
noticed
that
the
time
was
ten
minutes
short
of
midnight
soon
afterward
he
and
his
wife
went
to
bed
nothing
happened
to
disturb
and
rook
during
the
night
at
a
quarter
to
seven
the
next
morning
he
got
up
his
wife
being
still
asleep
he
had
been
instructed
to
wake
the
gentlemen
early
and
he
knocked
at
their
door
receiving
no
answer
after
repeatedly
knocking
he
opened
the
door
and
stepped
into
the
outhouse
at
this
point
in
his
evidence
the
witness

recollections
appeared
to
overpower
him
give
me
a
moment
gentlemen
he
said
to
the

a
dreadful
fright
and
i
don
t
believe

shall
get
over
it
for
the
rest
of
my
the
coroner
helped
him
by
a
question
what
did
you
see
when
you
opened
the
door
rook
answered
i
saw
the
dark
man
stretched
out
on
his
bed
dead
with
a
frightful
wound
in
his
throat
i
saw
an
open
razor
stained
with
smears
of
blood

the
door

into

yard
it
was

the
other
traveler

knapsack

these
discoveries

i
locked
the

chapter
xxv
j
rook
having
completed
his
evidence
the
police
authorities
were
the
next
witnesses
examined
they
had
not
found
the
slightest
trace
of
any
attempt
to
break
into
the
house
in
the
night
the
murdered
man
s
gold
watch
and
chain
were
discovered
under
his
pillow
on
examining
his
clothes
the
money
was
found
in
his
purse
and
the
gold
studs
and
sleeve
buttons
were
left
in
his
shirt
but
his
pocketbook
seen
by
witnesses
who
had
not
yet
been
examined
was
missing
the
search
for
visiting
cards
and
letters
had
proved
to
be
fruitless
only
the
initials
j
were
marked
on
his
linen
he
had
brought
no
luggage
with
him
to
the
inn
nothing
could
be
found
which
led
to
the
discovery
of
his
name
or
of
the
purpose
which
had
taken
him
into
that
part
of
the
country
the
police
examined
the
outhouse
next
in
search
of
circumstantial
evidence
against
the
missing
man
he
must
have
carried
away
his
knapsack
when
he
took
to
flight
but
he
had
been
probably
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
look
for
his
razor
or
perhaps
too
terrified
to
touch
it
if
it
had
attracted
his
notice
the
leather
roll
and
the
other
articles
used
for
his
toilet
had
been
taken
away
rook
identified
the
razor
he
had
noticed
overnight
the
name
of
the
belgian
city
liege
engraved
on
it
the
yard
was
the
next
place
inspected
were
found
on
the
muddy
earth
up
to
the
wall
but
the
road
on
the
other
side
had
been
recently
mended
with
stones
and
the
trace
of
the
fugitive
was
lost
casts
had
been
taken
of
the
footsteps
and
no
other
means
of
discovery
had
been
left
untried
the
authorities
in
london
had
also
been
communicated
with
by
telegraph
the
doctor
being
called
described
a
personal
peculiarity
which
he
had
noticed
at
the
examination
and
which
might
lead
to
the
identification
of
the
murdered
man
as
to
the
cause
of
death
the
witness
said
it
could
be
stated
in
two
words
the
internal
jugular
vein
had
been
cut
through
with
such
violence
judging
by
the
appearances
that
the
wound
could
not
have
been
inflicted
in
the
act
of
suicide
by
the
hand
of
the
deceased
person
no
other
injuries
and
no
sign
of
disease
was
found
on
the
body
the
one
cause
of
death
had
been
hemorrhage
and
the
one
peculiarity
which
called
for
notice
had
been
discovered
in
the
mouth
two
of
the
front
teeth
in
the
upper
jaw
were
false
they
had
been
so
admirably
made
to
resemble
the
natural
teeth
on
either
side
of
them
in
form
and
color
that
the
witness
had
only
hit
on
the
discovery
by
accidentally
touching
the
inner
side
of
the
gum
with
one
of
his
fingers
the
landlady
was
examined
when
the
doctor
had
retired
rook
was
able
in
answering
questions
put
to
her
to
give
important
information
in
reference
to
the
missing
pocketbook
before
retiring
to
rest
the
two
gentlemen
had
paid
the
bill
intending
to
leave
the
inn
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
the
traveler
with
the
knapsack
paid
his
share
in
money
the
other
unfortunate
gentleman
looked
into
his
purse
and
found
only
a
shilling
and
a
sixpence
in
it
he
asked
rook
if
she
could
change
a
she
told
him
it
could
be
done
provided
the
note
was
for
no
considerable
sum
of
money
upon
that
he
opened
his
pocketbook
which
the
witness
described
minutely
and
turned
out
the
contents
on
the
table
after
searching
among
many
bank
of
england
notes
some
in
one
pocket
of
the
book
and
some
in
another
he
found
a
note
of
the
value
of
five
pounds
he
thereupon
settled
his
bill
and
received
the
change
from
rook
her
husband
being
in
another
part
of
the
room
attending
to
the
guests
she
noticed
a
letter
in
an
envelope
and
a
few
cards
which
looked
to
her
judgment
like
visiting
cards
among
the
which
he
had
turned
out
on
the
table
when
she
returned
to
him
with
the
change
he
had
just
put
them
back
and
was
closing
the
pocketbook
she
saw
him
place
it
in
one
of
the
breast
pockets
of
his
coat
the
who
had
accompanied
him
to
the
inn
was
present
all
the
time
sitting
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
he
made
a
remark
when
he
saw
the
notes
produced
he
said
put
all
that
money
back
don
t
tempt
a
poor
man
like
me
it
was
said
laughing
as
if
by
way
of
a
joke
rook
had
observed
nothing
more
that
night
had
slept
as
soundly
as
usual
and
had
been
awakened
when
her
husband
knocked
at
the
outhouse
door
according
to
instructions
received
from
the
gentlemen
overnight
three
of
the
guests
in
the
public
room
corroborated
rook
s
evidence
they
were
respectable
persons
well
and
widely
known
in
that
part
of
hampshire
besides
these
there
were
two
strangers
staying
in
the
house
they
referred
the
coroner
to
their
employers
eminent
manufacturers
at
sheffield
and
wolverhampton
whose
testimony
spoke
for
itself
the
last
witness
called
was
a
grocer
in
the
village
who
kept
the
on
the
evening
of
the
a
dark
gentleman
wearing
his
beard
knocked
at
the
door
and
asked
for
a
letter
addressed
to
j
the
letter
had
arrived
by
that
morning
s
post
but
being
sunday
evening
the
grocer
requested
that
application
might
be
made
for
it
the
next
morning
the
stranger
said
the
letter
contained
news
which
it
was
of
importance
to
him
to
receive
without
delay
upon
this
the
grocer
made
an
exception
to
customary
rules
and
gave
him
the
letter
he
read
it
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
in
the
passage
it
must
have
been
short
for
the
reading
was
done
in
a
moment
he
seemed
to
think
over
it
for
a
while
and
then
he
turned
round
to
go
out
there
was
nothing
to
notice
in
his
look
or
in
his
manner
the
witness
offered
a
remark
on
the
weather
and
the
gentleman
said
yes
it
looks
like
a
bad
night
and
so
went
away
the
postmaster
s
evidence
was
of
importance
in
one
respect
it
suggested
the
motive
which
had
brought
the
deceased
to
zeeland
the
letter
addressed
to
j
was
in
all
probability
the
letter
seen
by
rook
among
the
contents
of
the
pocketbook
spread
out
on
the
table
the
inquiry
being
so
far
at
an
end
the
inquest
was
adjourned
on
the
chance
of
obtaining
additional
evidence
when
the
reported
proceedings
were
read
by
the
public
consulting
a
later
number
of
the
newspaper
emily
discovered
that
the
deceased
person
had
been
identified
by
a
witness
from
london
henry
forth
gentleman
s
valet
being
examined
made
the
following
statement
he
had
read
the
medical
evidence
contained
in
the
report
of
the
inquest
and
believing
that
he
could
identify
the
deceased
had
been
sent
by
his
present
master
to
assist
the
object
of
the
inquiry
ten
days
since
being
then
out
of
place
he
had
answered
an
advertisement
the
next
day
he
was
instructed
to
call
at
tracey
s
hotel
london
at
six
o
clock
in
the
evening
and
to
ask
for
james
brown
arriving
at
the
hotel
he
saw
the
gentleman
for
a
few
minutes
only
brown
had
a
friend
with
him
after
glancing
over
the
valet
s
references
he
said
i
haven
t
time
enough
to
speak
to
you
this
evening
call
here
morning
at
nine
o
the
gentleman
who
was
present
laughed
and
said
you
won
t
be
up
brown
answered
that
won
t
matter
the
man
can
come
to
my
bedroom
and
let
me
see
how
he
understands
his
duties
on
at
nine
the
next
morning
brown
was
reported
to
be
still
in
bed
and
the
witness
was
informed
of
the
number
of
the
room
he
knocked
at
the
door
a
drowsy
voice
inside
said
something
which
he
interpreted
as
meaning
come
he
went
in
the
was
on
his
left
hand
and
the
bed
with
the
lower
curtain
drawn
was
on
his
right
he
saw
on
the
table
a
tumbler
with
a
little
water
in
it
and
with
two
false
teeth
in
the
water
brown
started
up
in
bed
looked
at
him
furiously
abused
him
for
daring
to
enter
the
room
and
shouted
to
him
to
get
the
witness
not
accustomed
to
be
treated
in
that
way
felt
naturally
indignant
and
at
once
withdrew
but
not
before
he
had
plainly
seen
the
vacant
place
which
the
false
teeth
had
been
made
to
fill
perhaps
brown
had
forgotten
that
he
had
left
his
teeth
on
the
table
or
perhaps
he
the
valet
had
misunderstood
what
had
been
said
to
him
when
he
knocked
at
the
door
either
way
it
seemed
to
be
plain
enough
that
the
gentleman
resented
the
discovery
of
his
false
teeth
by
a
stranger
having
concluded
his
statement
the
witness
proceeded
to
identify
the
remains
of
the
deceased
he
at
once
recognized
the
gentleman
named
james
brown
whom
he
had
twice
seen
once
in
the
evening
and
again
the
next
morning
at
tracey
s
hotel
in
answer
to
further
inquiries
he
declared
that
he
knew
nothing
of
the
family
or
of
the
place
of
residence
of
the
deceased
he
complained
to
the
proprietor
of
the
hotel
of
the
rude
treatment
that
he
had
received
and
asked
if
tracey
knew
anything
of
james
brown
tracey
knew
nothing
of
him
on
consulting
the
hotel
book
it
was
found
that
he
had
given
notice
to
leave
that
afternoon
before
returning
to
london
the
witness
produced
references
which
gave
him
an
excellent
character
he
also
left
the
address
of
the
master
who
had
engaged
him
three
days
since
the
last
precaution
adopted
was
to
have
the
face
of
the
corpse
photographed
before
the
coffin
was
closed
on
the
same
day
the
jury
agreed
on
their
verdict
willful
murder
against
some
person
two
days
later
emily
found
a
last
allusion
to
the
crime
extracted
from
the
columns
of
the
hampshire
a
relative
of
the
deceased
seeing
the
report
of
the
adjourned
inquest
had
appeared
accompanied
by
a
medical
gentleman
had
seen
the
photograph
and
had
declared
the
identification
by
henry
forth
to
be
correct
among
other
particulars
now
communicated
for
the
first
time
it
was
stated
that
the
late
james
brown
had
been
unreasonably
sensitive
on
the
subject
of
his
false
teeth
and
that
the
one
member
of
his
family
who
knew
of
his
wearing
them
was
the
relative
who
now
claimed
his
remains
the
claim
having
been
established
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
authorities
the
corpse
was
removed
by
railroad
the
same
day
no
further
light
had
been
thrown
on
the
murder
the
handbill
offering
the
reward
and
describing
the
suspected
man
had
failed
to
prove
of
any
assistance
to
the
investigations
of
the
police
from
that
date
no
further
notice
of
the
crime
committed
at
the
inn
appeared
in
the
public
journals
emily
closed
the
volume
which
she
had
been
consulting
and
thankfully
acknowledged
the
services
of
the
librarian
the
new
reader
had
excited
this
gentleman
s
interest
noticing
how
carefully
she
examined
the
numbers
of
the
old
newspaper
he
looked
at
her
from
time
to
time
wondering
whether
it
was
good
news
or
bad
of
which
she
was
in
search
she
read
steadily
and
continuously
but
she
never
rewarded
his
curiosity
by
any
outward
sign
of
the
impression
that
had
been
produced
on
her
when
she
left
the
room
there
was
nothing
to
remark
in
her
manner
she
looked
quietly
thoughtful
and
that
was
all
the
librarian
smiled
amused
by
his
own
folly
because
a
stranger
s
appearance
had
attracted
him
he
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
circumstances
of
romantic
interest
must
be
connected
with
her
visit
to
the
library
far
from
misleading
him
as
he
supposed
his
fancy
might
have
been
employed
to
better
purpose
if
it
had
taken
a
higher
flight
still
and
had
associated
emily
with
the
fateful
gloom
of
tragedy
in
place
of
the
brighter
interest
of
romance
there
among
the
ordinary
readers
of
the
day
was
a
dutiful
and
affectionate
daughter
following
the
dreadful
story
of
the
death
of
her
father
by
murder
and
believing
it
to
be
the
story
of
a
stranger
because
she
loved
and
trusted
the
person
whose
mercy
had
deceived
her
that
very
discovery
the
dread
of
which
had
shaken
the
good
doctor
s
firm
nerves
had
forced
alban
to
exclude
from
his
confidence
the
woman
whom
he
loved
and
had
driven
the
faithful
old
servant
from
the
bedside
of
her
dying
mistress
that
very
discovery
emily
had
now
made
with
a
face
which
never
changed
color
and
a
heart
which
beat
at
ease
was
the
deception
that
had
won
this
cruel
victory
over
truth
destined
still
to
triumph
in
the
days
which
were
to
come

the
life
of

falsehood

in
it

door
and
revealed
alban
morris
as
restless
as
ever
walking
up
and
down
the
room
when
i
missed
you
at
the
museum
i
was
afraid
you
might
be
ill
he
said
ought
i
to
have
gone
away
when
my
anxiety
was
relieved
shall
i
go
away
now
you
must
take
a
chair
morris
and
hear
what
i
have
to
say
for
myself
when
you
left
me
after
your
last
visit
i
suppose
i
felt
the
force
of
example
at
any
rate
i
like
you
had
my
suspicions
i
have
been
trying
to
confirm
them
and
i
have
he
paused
with
the
chair
in
his
hand
suspicions
of
me
he
asked
certainly
can
you
guess
how
i
have
been
employed
for
the
last
two
days
no
not
even
your
ingenuity
can
do
that
i
have
been
hard
at
work
in
another
consulting
the
same
back
numbers
of
the
same
newspaper
which
you
have
been
examining
at
the
british
museum
there
is
my
confession
and
now
we
will
have
some
she
moved
to
the
fireplace
to
ring
the
bell
and
failed
to
see
the
effect
produced
on
alban
by
those
words
the
common
phrase
is
the
only
phrase
that
can
describe
it
he
was
thunderstruck
yes
she
resumed
i
have
read
the
report
of
the
inquest
if
i
know
nothing
else
i
know
that
the
murder
at
zeeland
can
t
be
the
discovery
which
you
are
bent
on
keeping
from
me
don
t
be
alarmed
for
the
preservation
of
your
secret
i
am
too
much
discouraged
to
try
the
servant
interrupted
them
by
answering
the
bell
alban
once
more
escaped
detection
emily
gave
her
orders
with
an
approach
to
the
old
gayety
of
her
school
days
tea
as
soon
as
possible
and
let
us
have
the
new
cake
are
you
too
much
of
a
man
morris
to
like
cake
in
this
state
of
agitation
he
was
unreasonably
irritated
by
that
playful
question
there
is
one
thing
i
like
better
than
cake
he
said
and
that
one
thing
is
a
plain
his
tone
puzzled
her
have
i
said
anything
to
offend
you
she
asked
surely
you
can
make
allowance
for
a
girl
s
curiosity
oh
you
shall
have
your
explanation
and
what
is
more
you
shall
have
it
without
reserve
she
was
as
good
as
her
word
what
she
had
thought
and
what
she
had
planned
when
he
left
her
after
his
last
visit
was
frankly
and
fully
told
if
you
wonder
how
i
discovered
the
library
she
went
on
i
must
refer
you
to
my
aunt
s
lawyer
he
lives
in
the
city
and
i
wrote
to
him
to
help
me
i
don
t
consider
that
my
time
has
been
wasted
morris
we
owe
an
apology
to
alban
s
astonishment
when
he
heard
this
forced
its
way
to
expression
in
words
what
can
you
possibly
mean
he
asked
the
tea
was
brought
in
before
emily
could
reply
she
filled
the
cups
and
sighed
as
she
looked
at
the
cake
if
cecilia
was
here
how
she
would
enjoy
it
with
that
complimentary
tribute
to
her
friend
she
handed
a
slice
to
alban
he
never
even
noticed
it
we
have
both
of
us
behaved
most
unkindly
to
rook
she
resumed
i
can
excuse
your
not
seeing
it
for
i
should
not
have
seen
it
either
but
for
the
newspaper
while
i
was
reading
i
had
an
opportunity
of
thinking
over
what
we
said
and
did
when
the
poor
woman
s
behavior
so
needlessly
offended
us
i
was
too
excited
to
think
at
the
time
and
besides
i
had
been
upset
only
the
night
before
by
what
miss
jethro
said
to
alban
started
what
has
miss
jethro
to
do
with
it
he
asked
nothing
at
all
emily
answered
she
spoke
to
me
of
her
own
private
affairs
a
long
story
and
you
wouldn
t
be
interested
in
it
let
me
finish
what
i
had
to
say
rook
was
naturally
reminded
of
the
murder
when
she
heard
that
my
name
was
brown
and
she
must
certainly
have
been
struck
as
i
was
by
the
coincidence
of
my
father
s
death
taking
place
at
the
same
time
when
his
unfortunate
namesake
was
killed
doesn
t
this
sufficiently
account
for
her
agitation
when
she
looked
at
the
locket
we
first
took
her
by
surprise
and
then
we
suspected
her
of
heaven
knows
what
because
the
poor
creature
didn
t
happen
to
have
her
wits
about
her
and
to
remember
at
the
right
moment
what
a
very
common
name
james
brown
is
don
t
you
see
it
as
i
do
i
see
that
you
have
arrived
at
a
remarkable
change
of
opinion
since
we
spoke
of
the
subject
in
the
garden
at
in
my
place
you
would
have
changed
your
opinion
too
i
shall
write
to
rook
by
tomorrow
s
alban
heard
her
with
dismay
pray
be
guided
by
my
advice
he
said
earnestly
pray
don
t
write
that
letter
why
not
it
was
too
late
to
recall
the
words
which
he
had
rashly
allowed
to
escape
him
how
could
he
reply
to
own
that
he
had
not
only
read
what
emily
had
read
but
had
carefully
copied
the
whole
narrative
and
considered
it
at
his
leisure
appeared
to
be
simply
impossible
after
what
he
had
now
heard
her
peace
of
mind
depended
absolutely
on
his
discretion
in
this
serious
emergency
silence
was
a
mercy
and
silence
was
a
lie
if
he
remained
silent
might
the
mercy
be
trusted
to
atone
for
the
lie
he
was
too
fond
of
emily
to
decide
that
question
fairly
on
its
own
merits
in
other
words
he
shrank
from
the
terrible
responsibility
of
telling
her
the
truth
isn
t
the
imprudence
of
writing
to
such
a
person
as
rook
plain
enough
to
speak
for
itself
he
suggested
cautiously
not
to
she
made
that
reply
rather
obstinately
alban
seemed
in
her
view
to
be
trying
to
prevent
her
from
atoning
for
an
act
of
injustice
besides
he
despised
her
cake
i
want
to
know
why
you
object
she
said
taking
back
the
neglected
slice
and
eating
it
herself
i
object
alban
answered
because
rook
is
a
coarse
presuming
woman
she
may
pervert
your
letter
to
some
use
of
her
own
which
you
may
have
reason
to
is
that
all
isn
t
it
enough
it
may
be
enough
for
when
i
have
done
a
person
an
injury
and
wish
to
make
an
apology
i
don
t
think
it
necessary
to
inquire
whether
the
person
s
manners
happen
to
be
vulgar
or
alban
s
patience
was
still
equal
to
any
demands
that
she
could
make
on
it
i
can
only
offer
you
advice
which
is
honestly
intended
for
your
own
good
he
gently
replied
you
would
have
more
influence
over
me
morris
if
you
were
a
little
readier
to
take
me
into
your
confidence
i
daresay
i
am
wrong
but
i
don
t
like
following
advice
which
is
given
to
me
in
the
it
was
impossible
to
offend
him
very
naturally
he
said
i
don
t
blame
her
color
deepened
and
her
voice
rose
alban
s
patient
adherence
to
his
own
view
so
courteously
and
considerately
urged
was
beginning
to
try
her
temper
in
plain
words
she
rejoined
i
am
to
believe
that
you
can
t
be
mistaken
in
your
judgment
of
another
there
was
a
ring
at
the
door
of
the
cottage
while
she
was
speaking
but
she
was
too
warmly
interested
in
confuting
alban
to
notice
it
he
was
quite
willing
to
be
confuted
even
when
she
lost
her
temper
she
was
still
interesting
to
him
i
don
t
expect
you
to
think
me
infallible
he
said
perhaps
you
will
remember
that
i
have
had
some
experience
i
am
unfortunately
older
than
you
oh
if
wisdom
comes
with
age
she
smartly
reminded
him
your
friend
miss
redwood
is
old
enough
to
be
your
mother
and
she
suspected
rook
of
murder
because
the
poor
woman
looked
at
a
door
and
disliked
being
in
the
next
room
to
a
fidgety
old
alban
s
manner
changed
he
shrank
from
that
chance
allusion
to
doubts
and
fears
which
he
dare
not
acknowledge
let
us
talk
of
something
else
he
said
she
looked
at
him
with
a
saucy
smile
have
i
driven
you
into
a
corner
at
last
and
is
your
way
of
getting
out
of
it
even
his
endurance
failed
are
you
trying
to
provoke
me
he
asked
are
you
no
better
than
other
women
i
wouldn
t
have
believed
it
of
you
emily
she
repeated
the
name
in
a
tone
of
surprise
which
reminded
him
that
he
had
addressed
her
with
familiarity
at
a
most
inappropriate
time
the
time
when
they
were
on
the
point
of
a
quarrel
he
felt
the
implied
reproach
too
keenly
to
be
able
to
answer
her
with
composure
i
think
of
emily
i
love
emily
my
one
hope
is
that
emily
may
love
me
oh
my
dear
is
there
no
excuse
if
i
forget
to
call
you
miss
when
you
distress
me
all
that
was
tender
and
true
in
her
nature
secretly
took
his
part
she
would
have
followed
that
better
impulse
if
he
had
only
been
calm
enough
to
understand
her
momentary
silence
and
to
give
her
time
but
the
temper
of
a
gentle
and
generous
man
once
roused
is
slow
to
subside
alban
abruptly
left
his
chair
i
had
better
go
he
said
as
you
please
she
answered
whether
you
go
morris
or
whether
you
stay
i
shall
write
to
the
ring
at
the
bell
was
followed
by
the
appearance
of
a
visitor
doctor
allday
opened
the
door
just
in
time
to
hear
emily
s
last
words
her
vehemence
seemed
to
amuse
him
who
is
rook
he
asked
a
most
respectable
person
emily
answered
indignantly
housekeeper
to
sir
jervis
redwood
you
needn
t
sneer
at
her
doctor
allday
she
has
not
always
been
in
service
she
was
landlady
of
the
inn
at
the
doctor
about
to
put
his
hat
on
a
chair
paused
the
inn
at
zeeland
reminded
him
of
the
handbill
and
of
the
visit
of
miss
jethro
why
are
you
so
hot
over
it
he
inquired
because
i
detest
prejudice
with
this
assertion
of
liberal
feeling
she
pointed
to
alban
standing
quietly
apart
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
there
is
the
most
prejudiced
man
living
he
hates
rook
would
you
like
to
be
introduced
to
him
you
re
a
philosopher
you
may
do
him
some
good
doctor
allday
alban
the
doctor
recognized
the
man
with
the
felt
hat
and
the
objectionable
beard
whose
personal
appearance
had
not
impressed
him
favorably
although
they
may
hesitate
to
acknowledge
it
there
are
respectable
englishmen
still
left
who
regard
a
felt
hat
and
a
beard
as
symbols
of
republican
disaffection
to
the
altar
and
the
throne
doctor
allday
s
manner
might
have
expressed
this
curious
form
of
patriotic
feeling
but
for
the
associations
which
emily
had
revived
in
his
present
frame
of
mind
he
was
outwardly
courteous
because
he
was
inwardly
suspicious
rook
had
been
described
to
him
as
formerly
landlady
of
the
inn
at
zeeland
were
there
reasons
for
morris
s
hostile
feeling
toward
this
woman
which
might
be
referable
to
the
crime
committed
in
her
house
that
might
threaten
emily
s
tranquillity
if
they
were
made
known
it
would
not
be
amiss
to
see
a
little
more
of
morris
on
the
first
convenient
occasion
i
am
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
you
are
very
kind
doctor
the
exchange
of
polite
conventionalities
having
been
accomplished
alban
approached
emily
to
take
his
leave
with
mingled
feelings
of
regret
and
anxiety
regret
for
having
allowed
himself
to
speak
harshly
anxiety
to
part
with
her
in
kindness
will
you
forgive
me
for
differing
from
you
it
was
all
he
could
venture
to
say
in
the
presence
of
a
stranger
oh
yes
she
said
quietly
will
you
think
again
before
you
decide
certainly
morris
but
it
won
t
alter
my
opinion
if
i
the
doctor
hearing
what
passed
between
them
frowned
on
what
subject
had
they
been
differing
and
what
opinion
did
emily
decline
to
alter
alban
gave
it
up
he
took
her
hand
gently
shall
i
see
you
at
the
museum
he
asked
she
was
politely
indifferent
to
the
last
yes
unless
something
happens
to
keep
me
at
the
doctor
s
eyebrows
still
expressed
disapproval
for
what
object
was
the
meeting
proposed
and
why
at
a
museum
doctor
for
a
moment
after
alban
s
departure
the
doctor
stood
irresolute
arriving
suddenly
at
a
decision
he
snatched
up
his
hat
and
turned
to
emily
in
a
hurry
i
bring
you
news
my
dear
which
will
surprise
you
who
do
you
think
has
just
left
my
house
ellmother
don
t
interrupt
me
she
has
made
up
her
mind
to
go
out
to
service
again
tired
of
leading
an
idle
life
that
s
her
own
account
of
it
and
asks
me
to
act
as
her
did
you
consent
consent
if
i
act
as
her
reference
i
shall
be
asked
how
she
came
to
leave
her
last
place
a
nice
dilemma
either
i
must
own
that
she
deserted
her
mistress
on
her
deathbed
or
tell
a
lie
when
i
put
it
to
her
in
that
way
she
walked
out
of
the
house
in
dead
silence
if
she
applies
to
you
next
receive
her
as
i
did
or
decline
to
see
her
which
would
be
better
why
am
i
to
decline
to
see
her
in
consequence
of
her
behavior
to
your
aunt
to
be
sure
no
i
have
said
all
i
wanted
to
say
and
i
have
no
time
to
spare
for
answering
idle
questions
doctors
try
the
patience
of
their
nearest
and
dearest
friends
in
this
respect
they
are
almost
always
in
a
hurry
doctor
allday
s
precipitate
departure
did
not
tend
to
soothe
emily
s
irritated
nerves
she
began
to
find
excuses
for
ellmother
in
a
spirit
of
pure
contradiction
the
old
servant
s
behavior
might
admit
of
justification
a
friendly
welcome
might
persuade
her
to
explain
herself
if
she
applies
to
me
emily
determined
i
shall
certainly
receive
having
arrived
at
this
resolution
her
mind
reverted
to
alban
some
of
the
sharp
things
she
had
said
to
him
subjected
to
in
solitude
failed
to
justify
themselves
her
better
sense
began
to
reproach
her
she
tried
to
silence
that
unwelcome
monitor
by
laying
the
blame
on
alban
why
had
he
been
so
patient
and
so
good
what
harm
was
there
in
his
calling
her
emily
if
he
had
told
her
to
call
by
his
christian
name
she
might
have
done
it
how
noble
he
looked
when
he
got
up
to
go
away
he
was
actually
handsome
women
may
say
what
they
please
and
write
what
they
please
their
natural
instinct
is
to
find
their
master
in
a
man
especially
when
they
like
him
sinking
lower
and
lower
in
her
own
estimation
emily
tried
to
turn
the
current
of
her
thoughts
in
another
direction
she
took
up
a
book
opened
it
looked
into
it
threw
it
across
the
room
if
alban
had
returned
at
that
moment
resolved
on
a
reconciliation
if
he
had
said
my
dear
i
want
to
see
you
like
yourself
again
will
you
give
me
a
kiss
and
make
it
up
would
he
have
left
her
crying
when
he
went
away
she
was
crying
now
chapter
xxvii
mentor
and
telemachus
if
emily
s
eyes
could
have
followed
alban
as
her
thoughts
were
following
him
she
would
have
seen
him
stop
before
he
reached
the
end
of
the
road
in
which
the
cottage
stood
his
heart
was
full
of
tenderness
and
sorrow
the
longing
to
return
to
her
was
more
than
he
could
resist
it
would
be
easy
to
wait
within
view
of
the
gate
until
the
doctor
s
visit
came
to
an
end
he
had
just
decided
to
go
back
and
keep
watch
when
he
heard
rapid
footsteps
approaching
there
devil
take
him
was
the
doctor
himself
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
morris
which
way
are
you
walking
any
way
alban
answered
not
very
graciously
then
let
us
take
the
turning
that
leads
to
my
house
it
s
not
customary
for
strangers
especially
when
they
happen
to
be
englishmen
to
place
confidence
in
each
other
let
me
set
the
example
of
violating
that
rule
i
want
to
speak
to
you
about
miss
emily

i
take
your
arm
thank
you
at
my
age
girls
in
general
unless
they
are
my
patients
are
not
objects
of
interest
to
me
but
that
girl
at
the
cottage
i
daresay
i
am
in
my
dotage
i
tell
you
sir
she
has
bewitched
me
upon
my
soul
i
could
hardly
be
more
anxious
about
her
if
i
was
her
father
and
mind
i
am
not
an
affectionate
man
by
nature
are
you
anxious
about
her
too
in
what
way
in
what
way
are
you
anxious
doctor
allday
the
doctor
smiled
grimly
you
don
t
trust
me
well
i
have
promised
to
set
the
example
keep
your
mask
on
sir
mine
is
off
come
what
may
of
it
but
observe
if
you
repeat
what
i
am
going
to
say
alban
would
hear
no
more
whatever
you
may
say
doctor
allday
is
trusted
to
my
honor
if
you
doubt
my
honor
be
so
good
as
to
let
go
my
arm
i
am
not
walking
your
the
doctor
s
hand
tightened
its
grasp
that
little
flourish
of
temper
my
dear
sir
is
all
i
want
to
set
me
at
my
ease
i
feel
i
have
got
hold
of
the
right
man
now
answer
me
this
have
you
ever
heard
of
a
person
named
miss
jethro
alban
suddenly
came
to
a
standstill
all
right
said
the
doctor
i
couldn
t
have
wished
for
a
more
satisfactory
wait
a
minute
alban
interposed
i
know
miss
jethro
as
a
teacher
at
miss
ladd
s
school
who
left
her
situation
suddenly
and
i
know
no
the
doctor
s
peculiar
smile
made
its
appearance
again
speaking
in
the
vulgar
tone
he
said
you
seem
to
be
in
a
hurry
to
wash
your
hands
of
miss
i
have
no
reason
to
feel
any
interest
in
her
alban
replied
don
t
be
too
sure
of
that
my
friend
i
have
something
to
tell
you
which
may
alter
your
opinion
that
at
the
school
sir
knows
how
the
late
brown
met
his
death
and
how
his
daughter
has
been
deceived
about
alban
listened
with
surprise
and
with
some
little
doubt
which
he
thought
it
wise
not
to
acknowledge
the
report
of
the
inquest
alludes
to
a
relative
who
claimed
the
body
he
said
was
that
relative
the
person
who
deceived
miss
emily
and
was
the
person
her
aunt
i
must
leave
you
to
take
your
own
view
doctor
allday
replied
a
promise
binds
me
not
to
repeat
the
information
that
i
have
received
setting
that
aside
we
have
the
same
object
in
view
and
we
must
take
care
not
to
get
in
each
other
s
way
here
is
my
house
let
us
go
in
and
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
on
both
established
in
the
safe
seclusion
of
his
study
the
doctor
set
the
example
of
confession
in
these
plain
terms
we
only
differ
in
opinion
on
one
point
he
said
we
both
think
it
likely
from
our
experience
of
the
women
that
the
suspected
murderer
had
an
accomplice
i
say
the
guilty
person
is
miss
jethro
you
say
when
you
have
read
my
copy
of
the
report
alban
answered
i
think
you
will
arrive
at
my
conclusion
rook
might
have
entered
the
outhouse
in
which
the
two
men
slept
at
any
time
during
the
night
while
her
husband
was
asleep
the
jury
believed
her
when
she
declared
that
she
never
woke
till
the
morning
i
don
i
am
open
to
conviction
morris
now
about
the
future
do
you
mean
to
go
on
with
your
inquiries
even
if
i
had
no
other
motive
than
mere
curiosity
alban
answered
i
think
i
should
go
on
but
i
have
a
more
urgent
purpose
in
view
all
that
i
have
done
thus
far
has
been
done
in
emily
s
interests
my
object
from
the
first
has
been
to
preserve
her
from
any
association
in
the
past
or
in
the
future
with
the
woman
whom
i
believe
to
have
been
concerned
in
her
father
s
death
as
i
have
already
told
you
she
is
innocently
doing
all
she
can
poor
thing
to
put
obstacles
in
my
yes
yes
said
the
doctor
she
means
to
write
to
rook
and
you
have
nearly
quarreled
about
it
trust
me
to
take
that
matter
in
hand
i
don
t
regard
it
as
serious
but
i
am
mortally
afraid
of
what
you
are
doing
in
emily
s
interests
i
wish
you
would
give
it
why
because
i
see
a
danger
i
don
t
deny
that
emily
is
as
innocent
of
suspicion
as
ever
but
the
chances
next
time
may
be
against
us
how
do
you
know
to
what
lengths
your
curiosity
may
lead
you
or
on
what
shocking
discoveries
you
may
not
blunder
with
the
best
intentions
some
unforeseen
accident
may
open
her
eyes
to
the
truth
before
you
can
prevent
it
i
seem
to
surprise
you
you
do
indeed
surprise
in
the
old
story
my
dear
sir
mentor
sometimes
surprised
telemachus
i
am
mentor
without
being
i
hope
quite
so
as
that
respectable
philosopher
let
me
put
it
in
two
words
emily
s
happiness
is
precious
to
you
take
care
you
are
not
made
the
means
of
wrecking
it
will
you
consent
to
a
sacrifice
for
her
sake
i
will
do
anything
for
her
will
you
give
up
your
inquiries
from
this
moment
i
have
done
with
them
mr
morris
you
are
the
best
friend
she
the
next
best
friend
to
you
in
that
fond
persuasion
they
now
parted
too
eagerly
devoted
to
emily
to
look
at
the
prospect
before
them
in
its
least
hopeful
aspect
both
clever
men
neither
one
nor
the
other
asked
himself
if
any
human
resistance
has
ever
yet
obstructed
the
progress
of
truth
when
truth
has
once
begun
to
force
its
way
to
the
light
for
the
second
time
alban
stopped
on
his
way
home
the
longing
to
be
reconciled
with
emily
was
not
to
be
resisted
he
returned
to
the
cottage
only
to
find
disappointment
waiting
for
him
the
servant
reported
that
her
young
mistress
had
gone
to
bed
with
a
bad
headache
alban
waited
a
day
in
the
hope
that
emily
might
write
to
him
no
letter
arrived
he
repeated
his
visit
the
next
morning
fortune
was
still
against
him
on
this
occasion
emily
was
engaged
engaged
with
a
visitor
he
asked
yes
sir
a
young
lady
named
miss
de
where
had
he
heard
that
name
before
he
remembered
immediately
that
he
had
heard
it
at
the
school
miss
de
sor
was
the
unattractive
new
pupil
whom
the
girls
called
francine
alban
looked
at
the
parlor
window
as
he
left
the
cottage
it
was
of
serious
importance
that
he
should
set
himself
right
with
emily
and
mere
gossip
he
thought
contemptuously
stands
in
my
way
if
he
had
been
less
absorbed
in
his
own
interests
he
might
have
remembered
that
mere
gossip
is
not
always
to
be
despised
it
has
worked
fatal
mischief
in
its
time
chapter
xxviii
francine
you
re
surprised
to
see
me
of
course
saluting
emily
in
those
terms
francine
looked
round
the
parlor
with
an
air
of
satirical
curiosity
dear
me
what
a
little
place
to
live
in
what
brings
you
to
london
emily
inquired
you
ought
to
know
my
dear
without
asking
why
did
i
try
to
make
friends
with
you
at
school
and
why
have
i
been
trying
ever
since
because
i
hate
you
i
mean
because
i
can
t
resist
you
no
i
mean
because
i
hate
myself
for
liking
you
oh
never
mind
my
reasons
i
insisted
on
going
to
london
with
miss
ladd
when
that
horrid
woman
announced
that
she
had
an
appointment
with
her
lawyer
i
said
i
want
to
see
emily

t
like
i
don
t
care
whether
she
likes
me
or
not
i
want
to
see
that
s
the
way
we
snap
at
each
other
and
that
s
how
i
always
carry
my
point
here
i
am
till
my
duenna
finishes
her
business
and
fetches
me
what
a
prospect
for
you
have
you
got
any
cold
meat
in
the
house
i
m
not
a
glutton
like
cecilia
but
i
m
afraid
i
shall
want
some
don
t
talk
in
that
way
francine
do
you
mean
to
say
you
re
glad
to
see
me
if
you
were
only
a
little
less
hard
and
bitter
i
should
always
be
glad
to
see
you
darling
excuse
my
impetuosity
what
are
you
looking
at
my
new
dress
do
you
envy
me
no
i
admire
the
color
that
s
francine
rose
and
shook
out
her
dress
and
showed
it
from
every
point
of
view
see
how
it
s
made
paris
of
course
money
my
dear
money
will
do
anything
except
making
one
learn
one
s
are
you
not
getting
on
any
better
francine
worse
my
sweet
friend
worse
one
of
the
masters
i
am
happy
to
say
has
flatly
refused
to
teach
me
any
longer
pupils
without
brains
i
am
accustomed
to
he
said
in
his
broken
english
but
a
pupil
with
no
heart
is
beyond
my
ha
ha
the
mouldy
old
refugee
has
an
eye
for
character
though
no
heart
there
i
am
described
in
two
and
proud
of
it
emily
remarked
yes
proud
of
it
stop
let
me
do
myself
justice
you
consider
tears
a
sign
that
one
has
some
heart
don
t
you
i
was
very
near
crying
last
sunday
a
popular
preacher
did
it
no
less
a
person
that
mirabel
you
look
as
if
you
had
heard
of
i
have
heard
of
him
from
is
at
brighton
then
there
s
one
fool
more
in
a
fashionable
watering
place
oh
she
s
in
switzerland
is
she
i
don
t
care
where
she
is
i
only
care
about
mirabel
we
all
heard
he
was
at
brighton
for
his
health
and
was
going
to
preach
didn
t
we
cram
the
church
as
to
describing
him
i
give
it
up
he
is
the
only
little
man
i
ever
admired
hair
as
long
as
mine
and
the
sort
of
beard
you
see
in
pictures
i
wish
i
had
his
fair
complexion
and
his
white
hands
we
were
all
in
love
with
him
or
with
his
voice
which
was
it
when
he
began
to
read
the
commandments
i
wish
i
could
imitate
him
when
he
came
to
the
fifth
commandment
he
began
in
his
deepest
bass
voice
honor
thy
father
he
stopped
and
looked
up
to
heaven
as
if
he
saw
the
rest
of
it
there
he
went
on
with
a
tremendous
emphasis
on
the
next
word
thy
mother
he
said
as
if
that
was
quite
a
different
thing
in
a
tearful
fluty
quivering
voice
which
was
a
compliment
to
mothers
in
itself
we
all
felt
it
mothers
or
not
but
the
great
sensation
was
when
he
got
into
the
pulpit
the
manner
in
which
he
dropped
on
his
knees
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
and
showed
his
beautiful
rings
was
as
a
young
lady
said
behind
me
simply
seraphic
we
understood
his
celebrity
from
that
moment
i
wonder
whether
i
can
remember
the
you
needn
t
attempt
it
on
my
account
emily
said
my
dear
don
t
be
obstinate
wait
till
you
hear
i
am
quite
content
to
ah
you
re
just
in
the
right
state
of
mind
to
be
converted

re
in
a
fair
way
to
become
one
of
his
greatest
admirers
they
say
he
is
so
agreeable
in
private
life
i
am
dying
to
know
do
i
hear
a
ring
at
the
bell

somebody
else
coming
to
see
you
the
servant
brought
in
a
card
and
a
message
the
person
will
call
again
emily
looked
at
the
name
written
on
the
card
mrs
ellmother
she
exclaimed
what
an
extraordinary
name
cried
francine
who
is
she
my
aunt
s
old
does
she
want
a
situation
emily
looked
at
some
lines
of
writing
at
the
back
of
the
card
doctor
allday
had
rightly
foreseen
events
rejected
by
the
doctor
ellmother
had
no
alternative
but
to
ask
emily
to
help
her
if
she
is
out
of
place
francine
went
on
she
may
be
just
the
sort
of
person
i
am
looking
you
emily
asked
in
astonishment
francine
refused
to
explain
until
she
got
an
answer
to
her
question
tell
me
first
she
said
is
ellmother
engaged
no
she
wants
an
engagement
and
she
asks
me
to
be
her
is
she
sober
honest
clean
steady
industrious
francine
rattled
on
has
she
all
the
virtues
and
none
of
the
vices
is
she
not
too
and
has
she
no
male
followers

one
terrible
word

she
satisfy
miss
ladd

miss
ladd
to
do
with
it

of
my
masters

ladd
s
pupil

to
my
laziness
and

temper

am
to

to
the
dignity
of
a
parlor

other
words

am
to
be
a
young
lady
who
patronizes
the
school
with
a
room
of
my
own
and
a
servant
of

bottom
of
it
i
have
not
the
least
doubt

t
appear
to
understand

t
indeed

considered
a
little
perhaps

were
fond
of
you
at
home

suggested

loved
me
francine
and
i
loved

position

the
reverse
of
yours

have
got

of
me

don
t
want
me
back
again
at
home

know
as
well
what
my
mother
said
to
my
father
as
if
i
had
heard
her
francine
will
never
get
on
at
school
at
her
age
try
her
by
all
means
but
make
some
other
arrangement
with
miss
ladd

won
t
shock
your
sensibilities

us
get
back
to

of
fact
when
i
begin
my
new
life
miss
ladd
makes
one
condition
my
maid
is
to
be
a
model
of
discretion

elderly
woman

skittish
young
person
who
will
only
encourage
me
i
must
submit
to
the
elderly
woman
or
i
shall
be
sent
back

west
indies
after
all
how
long

chance
of
helping
you
emily
answered
excepting
good
doctor
allday
on
the
point
of
adding
the
name
of
alban
morris
she
checked
herself
without
knowing
why
and
substituted
the
name
of
her
and
not
forgetting
cecilia
she
resumed
i
know
cecilia
s
a
fool
francine
remarked
gravely
but
now
i
think
of
it
she
may
be
worth
cultivating
her
father
is
a
member
of
parliament
and
didn
t
i
hear
that
he
has
a
fine
place
in
the
country
you
see
emily
i
may
expect
to
be
married
with
my
money
if
i
can
only
get
into
good
society
don
t
suppose
i
am
dependent
on
my
father
my
marriage
portion
is
provided
for
in
my
uncle
s
will
cecilia
may
really
be
of
some
use
to
me
why
shouldn
t
i
make
a
friend
of
her
and
get
introduced
to
her
father
in
the
autumn
you
know
when
the
house
is
full
of
company
have
you
any
idea
when
she
is
coming
back
do
you
think
of
writing
to
her
of
course
give
her
my
kind
love
and
say
i
hope
she
enjoys
francine
you
are
positively
shameless
after
calling
my
dearest
friend
a
fool
and
a
glutton
you
send
her
your
love
for
your
own
selfish
ends
and
you
expect
me
to
help
you
in
deceiving
her
i
won
t
do
keep
your
temper
my
child
we
are
all
selfish
you
little
goose
the
only
difference
is
some
of
us
own
it
and
some
of
us
don
t
i
shall
find
my
own
way
to
cecilia
s
good
graces
quite
easily
the
way
is
through
her
mouth
you
mentioned
a
certain
doctor
allday
does
he
give
parties
and
do
the
right
sort
of
men
go
to
them
hush
i
think
i
hear
the
bell
again
go
to
the
door
and
see
who
it
emily
waited
without
taking
any
notice
of
this
suggestion
the
servant
announced
that
the
person
had
called
again
to
know
if
there
was
any
show
her
in
here
emily
said
the
servant
withdrew
and
came
back
again
the
person
doesn
t
wish
to
intrude
miss
it
will
be
quite
sufficient
if
you
will
send
a
message
by
emily
crossed
the
room
to
the
door
come
in
ellmother
she
said
you
have
been
too
long
away
already
pray
come
chapter
xxix
ellmother
reluctantly
entered
the
room
since
emily
had
seen
her
last
her
personal
appearance
doubly
justified
the
nickname
by
which
her
late
mistress
had
distinguished
her
the
old
servant
was
worn
and
wasted
her
gown
hung
loose
on
her
angular
body
the
big
bones
of
her
face
stood
out
more
prominently
than
ever
she
took
emily
s
offered
hand
doubtingly
i
hope
i
see
you
well
miss
she
said
with
hardly
a
vestige
left
of
her
former
firmness
of
voice
and
manner
i
am
afraid
you
have
been
suffering
from
illness
emily
answered
gently
it
s
the
life
i
m
leading
that
wears
me
down
i
want
work
and
making
that
reply
she
looked
round
and
discovered
francine
observing
her
with
undisguised
curiosity
you
have
got
company
with
you
she
said
to
emily
i
had
better
go
away
and
come
back
another
francine
stopped
her
before
she
could
open
the
door
you
mustn
t
go
away
i
wish
to
speak
to
about
what
miss
the
eyes
of
the
two
women
met
one
near
the
end
of
her
life
concealing
under
a
rugged
surface
a
nature
sensitively
affectionate
and
incorruptibly
true
the
other
young
in
years
without
the
virtues
of
youth
hard
in
manner
and
hard
at
heart
in
silence
on
either
side
they
stood
face
to
face
strangers
brought
together
by
the
force
of
circumstances
working
inexorably
toward
their
hidden
end
emily
introduced
ellmother
to
francine
it
may
be
worth
your
while
she
hinted
to
hear
what
this
young
lady
has
to
ellmother
listened
with
little
appearance
of
interest
in
anything
that
a
stranger
might
have
to
say
her
eyes
rested
on
the
card
which
contained
her
written
request
to
emily
francine
watching
her
closely
understood
what
was
passing
in
her
mind
it
might
be
worth
while
to
conciliate
the
old
woman
by
a
little
act
of
attention
turning
to
emily
francine
pointed
to
the
card
lying
on
the
table
you
have
not
attended
yet
to
ellmother
s
request
she
said
emily
at
once
assured
ellmother
that
the
request
was
granted
but
is
it
wise
she
asked
to
go
out
to
service
again
at
your
age
i
have
been
used
to
service
all
my
life
miss
emily
that
s
one
reason
and
service
may
help
me
to
get
rid
of
my
own
thoughts
that
s
another
if
you
can
find
me
a
situation
somewhere
you
will
be
doing
me
a
good
is
it
useless
to
suggest
that
you
might
come
back
and
live
with
me
emily
ventured
to
say
ellmother
s
head
sank
on
her
breast
thank
you
kindly
miss
it
why
is
it
useless
francine
asked
ellmother
was
silent
miss
de
sor
is
speaking
to
you
emily
reminded
her
am
i
to
answer
miss
de
sor
attentively
observing
what
passed
and
placing
her
own
construction
on
looks
and
tones
it
suddenly
struck
francine
that
emily
herself
might
be
in
ellmother
s
confidence
and
that
she
might
have
reasons
of
her
own
for
assuming
ignorance
when
awkward
questions
were
asked
for
the
moment
at
least
francine
decided
on
keeping
her
suspicions
to
herself
i
may
perhaps
offer
you
the
employment
you
want
she
said
to
ellmother
i
am
staying
at
brighton
for
the
present
with
the
lady
who
was
miss
emily
s
schoolmistress
and
i
am
in
need
of
a
maid
would
you
be
willing
to
consider
it
if
i
proposed
to
engage
you
yes
in
that
case
you
can
hardly
object
to
the
customary
inquiry
why
did
you
leave
your
last
place
ellmother
appealed
to
emily
did
you
tell
this
young
lady
how
long
i
remained
in
my
last
place
melancholy
remembrances
had
been
revived
in
emily
by
the
turn
which
the
talk
had
now
taken
francine
s
patience
stealthily
feeling
its
way
to
its
end
jarred
on
her
nerves
yes
she
said
in
justice
to
you
i
have
mentioned
your
long
term
of
ellmother
addressed
francine
you
know
miss
that
i
served
my
late
mistress
for
over
years
will
you
please
remember
that
and
let
it
be
a
reason
for
not
asking
me
why
i
left
my
francine
smiled
compassionately
my
good
creature
you
have
mentioned
the
very
reason
why
i
ask
you
live
years
with
your
mistress
and
then
suddenly
leave
her
and
you
expect
me
to
pass
over
this
extraordinary
proceeding
without
inquiry
take
a
little
time
to
i
want
no
time
to
think
what
i
had
in
my
mind
when
i
left
miss
letitia
is
something
which
i
refuse
to
explain
miss
to
you
or
to
she
recovered
some
of
her
old
firmness
when
she
made
that
reply
francine
saw
the
necessity
of
yielding
for
the
time
at
least
emily
remained
silent
oppressed
by
remembrance
of
the
doubts
and
fears
which
had
darkened
the
last
miserable
days
of
her
aunt
s
illness
she
began
already
to
regret
having
made
francine
and
ellmother
known
to
each
other
i
won
t
dwell
on
what
appears
to
be
a
painful
subject
francine
graciously
resumed
i
meant
no
offense
you
are
not
angry
i
hope
sorry
miss
i
might
have
been
angry
at
one
time
that
time
is
it
was
said
sadly
and
resignedly
emily
heard
the
answer
her
heart
ached
as
she
looked
at
the
old
servant
and
thought
of
the
contrast
between
past
and
present
with
what
a
hearty
welcome
this
broken
woman
had
been
used
to
receive
her
in
the
bygone
her
eyes
moistened
she
felt
the
merciless
persistency
of
francine
as
if
it
had
been
an
insult
offered
to
herself
give
it
up
she
said
sharply
leave
me
my
dear
to
manage
my
own
business
francine
replied
about
your
qualifications
she
continued
turning
coolly
to
ellmother
can
you
dress
hair
i
ought
to
tell
you
francine
insisted
that
i
am
very
particular
about
my
my
mistress
was
very
particular
about
her
hair
ellmother
answered
are
you
a
good
needlewoman
as
good
as
ever
i
was
with
the
help
of
my
francine
turned
to
emily
see
how
well
we
get
on
together
we
are
beginning
to
understand
each
other
already
i
am
an
odd
creature
ellmother
sometimes
i
take
sudden
likings
to
persons
i
have
taken
a
liking
to
you
do
you
begin
to
think
a
little
better
of
me
than
you
did
i
hope
you
will
produce
the
right
impression
on
miss
ladd
you
shall
have
every
assistance
that
i
can
give
i
will
beg
miss
ladd
as
a
favor
to
me
not
to
ask
you
that
one
forbidden
poor
ellmother
puzzled
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
francine
in
the
character
of
an
eccentric
young
lady
the
creature
of
genial
impulse
thought
it
right
to
express
her
gratitude
for
the
promised
interference
in
her
favor
that
s
kind
of
you
miss
she
said
no
no
only
just
i
ought
to
tell
you
there
s
one
thing
miss
ladd
is
strict
about
sweethearts
are
you
quite
sure
francine
inquired
jocosely
that
you
can
answer
for
yourself
in
that
particular
this
effort
of
humor
produced
its
intended
effect
ellmother
thrown
off
her
guard
actually
smiled
lord
miss
what
will
you
say
next
my
good
soul
i
will
say
something
next
that
is
more
to
the
purpose
if
miss
ladd
asks
me
why
you
have
so
unaccountably
refused
to
be
a
servant
again
in
this
house
i
shall
take
care
to
say
that
it
is
certainly
not
out
of
dislike
to
miss
you
need
say
nothing
of
the
sort
emily
quietly
remarked
and
still
less
francine
proceeded
without
noticing
the
interruption
still
less
through
any
disagreeable
remembrances
of
miss
emily
s
ellmother
saw
the
trap
that
had
been
set
for
her
it
won
t
do
miss
she
said
what
won
t
do
trying
to
pump
francine
burst
out
laughing
emily
noticed
an
artificial
ring
in
her
gayety
which
suggested
that
she
was
exasperated
rather
than
amused
by
the
repulse
which
had
baffled
her
curiosity
once
more
ellmother
reminded
the
merry
young
lady
that
the
proposed
arrangement
between
them
had
not
been
concluded
yet
am
i
to
understand
miss
that
you
will
keep
a
place
open
for
me
in
your
service
you
are
to
understand
francine
replied
sharply
that
i
must
have
miss
ladd
s
approval
before
i
can
engage
you
suppose
you
come
to
brighton
i
will
pay
your
fare
of
never
mind
my
fare
miss
will
you
give
up
pumping
make
your
mind
easy
it
s
quite
useless
to
attempt
pumping
when
will
you
come
ellmother
pleaded
for
a
little
delay
i
m
altering
my
gowns
she
said
i
get
thinner
and
thinner
don
t
i
miss
emily
my
work
won
t
be
done
before
let
us
say
friday
then
francine
proposed
friday
ellmother
exclaimed
you
forget
that
friday
is
an
unlucky
i
forgot
that
certainly
how
can
you
be
so
absurdly
you
may
call
it
what
you
like
miss
i
have
good
reason
to
think
as
i
do
i
was
married
on
a
friday
and
a
bitter
bad
marriage
it
turned
out
to
be
superstitious
indeed
you
don
t
know
what
my
experience
has
been
my
only
sister
was
one
of
a
party
of
thirteen
at
dinner
and
she
died
within
the
year
if
we
are
to
get
on
together
nicely
i
ll
take
that
journey
on
saturday
if
you
anything
to
satisfy
you
francine
agreed
there
is
the
address
come
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
we
will
give
you
your
dinner
no
fear
of
our
being
thirteen
in
number
what
will
you
do
if
you
have
the
misfortune
to
spill
the
salt
take
a
pinch
between
my
finger
and
thumb
and
throw
it
over
my
left
shoulder
ellmother
answered
gravely
emily
followed
the
departing
visitor
out
to
the
hall
she
had
seen
and
heard
enough
to
decide
her
on
trying
to
break
off
the
proposed
negotiation
with
the
one
kind
purpose
of
protecting
ellmother
against
the
pitiless
curiosity
of
francine
do
you
think
you
and
that
young
lady
are
likely
to
get
on
well
together
she
asked
i
have
told
you
already
miss
emily
i
want
to
get
away
from
my
own
home
and
my
own
thoughts
i
don
t
care
where
i
go
so
long
as
i
do
having
answered
in
those
words
ellmother
opened
the
door
and
waited
a
while
thinking
i
wonder
whether
the
dead
know
what
is
going
on
in
the
world
they
have
left
she
said
looking
at
emily
if
they
do
there
s
one
among
them
knows
my
thoughts
and
feels
for
me
miss
and
don
t
think
worse
of
me
than
i
emily
went
back
to
the
parlor
the
only
resource
left
was
to
plead
with
francine
for
mercy
to
ellmother
do
you
really
mean
to
give
it
up
she
asked
to
give
up
what
pumping
as
that
obstinate
old
creature
calls
it
emily
persisted
don
t
worry
the
poor
old
soul
however
strangely
she
may
have
left
my
aunt
and
me
her
motives
are
kind
and
good
i
am
sure
of
that
will
you
let
her
keep
her
harmless
little
secret
oh
of
course
i
don
t
believe
you
francine
don
t
you
i
am
like
cecilia
i
am
getting
hungry
shall
we
have
some
lunch
you
creature
does
that
mean
no
luncheon
until
i
have
owned
the
truth
suppose
own
the
truth
i
won
t
tell
ellmother
that
you
have
betrayed
for
the
last
time
francine
i
know
no
more
of
it
than
you
do
if
you
persist
in
taking
your
own
view
you
as
good
as
tell
me
i
lie
and
you
will
oblige
me
to
leave
the
even
francine
s
obstinacy
was
compelled
to
give
way
so
far
as
appearances
went
still
possessed
by
the
delusion
that
emily
was
deceiving
her
she
was
now
animated
by
a
stronger
motive
than
mere
curiosity
her
sense
of
her
own
importance
imperatively
urged
her
to
prove
that
she
was
not
a
person
who
could
be
deceived
with
impunity
i
beg
your
pardon
she
said
with
humility
but
i
must
positively
have
it
out
with
ellmother
she
has
been
more
than
a
match
for
me
my
turn
next
i
mean
to
get
the
better
of
her
and
i
shall
i
have
already
told
you
francine
you
will
my
dear
i
am
a
dunce
and
i
don
t
deny
it
but
let
me
tell
you
one
thing
i
haven
t
lived
all
my
life
in
the
west
indies
among
black
servants
without
learning
what
do
you
mean
more
my
clever
friend
than
you
are
likely
to
guess
in
the
meantime
don
t
forget
the
duties
of
hospitality
ring
the
bell
for
chapter
xxx
lady
doris
the
arrival
of
miss
ladd
some
time
before
she
had
been
expected
interrupted
the
two
girls
at
a
critical
moment
she
had
hurried
over
her
business
in
london
eager
to
pass
the
rest
of
the
day
with
her
favorite
pupil
emily
s
affectionate
welcome
was
in
some
degree
at
least
inspired
by
a
sensation
of
relief
to
feel
herself
in
the
embrace
of
the
schoolmistress
was
like
finding
a
refuge
from
francine
when
the
hour
of
departure
arrived
miss
ladd
invited
emily
to
brighton
for
the
second
time
on
the
last
occasion
my
dear
you
wrote
me
an
excuse
i
won
t
be
treated
in
that
way
again
if
you
can
t
return
with
us
now
come
she
added
in
a
whisper
otherwise
i
shall
think
you
include
in
your
dislike
of
there
was
no
resisting
this
it
was
arranged
that
emily
should
go
to
brighton
on
the
next
day
left
by
herself
her
thoughts
might
have
reverted
to
ellmother
s
doubtful
prospects
and
to
francine
s
strange
allusion
to
her
life
in
the
west
indies
but
for
the
arrival
of
two
letters
by
the
afternoon
post
the
handwriting
on
one
of
them
was
unknown
to
her
she
opened
that
one
first
it
was
an
answer
to
the
letter
of
apology
which
she
had
persisted
in
writing
to
rook
happily
for
herself
alban
s
influence
had
not
been
without
its
effect
after
his
departure
she
had
written
kindly
but
she
had
written
briefly
at
the
same
time
rook
s
reply
presented
a
nicely
compounded
mixture
of
gratitude
and
grief
the
gratitude
was
addressed
to
emily
as
a
matter
of
course
the
grief
related
to
her
excellent
sir
jervis
s
strength
had
suddenly
failed
his
medical
attendant
being
summoned
had
expressed
no
surprise
my
patient
is
over
seventy
years
of
age
the
doctor
remarked
he
will
sit
up
late
at
night
writing
his
book
and
he
refuses
to
take
exercise
till
headache
and
giddiness
force
him
to
try
the
fresh
air
as
the
necessary
result
he
has
broken
down
at
last
it
may
end
in
paralysis
or
it
may
end
in
reporting
this
expression
of
medical
opinion
rook
s
letter
glided
imperceptibly
from
respectful
sympathy
to
modest
regard
for
her
own
interests
in
the
future
it
might
be
the
sad
fate
of
her
husband
and
herself
to
be
thrown
on
the
world
again
if
necessity
brought
them
to
london
would
kind
miss
emily
grant
her
the
honor
of
an
interview
and
favor
a
poor
unlucky
woman
with
a
word
of
advice
she
may
pervert
your
letter
to
some
use
of
her
own
which
you
may
have
reason
to
did
emily
remember
alban
s
warning
words
no
she
accepted
rook
s
reply
as
a
gratifying
tribute
to
the
justice
of
her
own
opinions
having
proposed
to
write
to
alban
feeling
penitently
that
she
had
been
in
the
wrong
she
was
now
readier
than
ever
to
send
him
a
letter
feeling
compassionately
that
she
had
been
in
the
right
besides
it
was
due
to
the
faithful
friend
who
was
still
working
for
her
in
the
reading
room
that
he
should
be
informed
of
sir
jervis
s
illness
whether
the
old
man
lived
or
whether
he
died
his
literary
labors
were
fatally
interrupted
in
either
case
and
one
of
the
consequences
would
be
the
termination
of
her
employment
at
the
museum
although
the
second
of
the
two
letters
which
she
had
received
was
addressed
to
her
in
cecilia
s
handwriting
emily
waited
to
read
it
until
she
had
first
written
to
alban
he
will
come
she
thought
and
we
shall
both
make
apologies
i
shall
regret
that
i
was
angry
with
him
and
he
will
regret
that
he
was
mistaken
in
his
judgment
of
rook
we
shall
be
as
good
friends
again
as
in
this
happy
frame
of
mind
she
opened
cecilia
s
letter
it
was
full
of
good
news
from
first
to
last
the
invalid
sister
had
made
such
rapid
progress
toward
recovery
that
the
travelers
had
arranged
to
set
forth
on
their
journey
back
to
england
in
a
fortnight
my
one
regret
cecilia
added
is
the
parting
with
lady
doris
she
and
her
husband
are
going
to
genoa
where
they
will
embark
in
lord
janeaway
s
yacht
for
a
cruise
in
the
mediterranean
when
we
have
said
that
miserable
word
oh
emily
what
a
hurry
i
shall
be
in
to
get
back
to
you
those
allusions
to
your
lonely
life
are
so
dreadful
my
dear
that
i
have
destroyed
your
letter
it
is
enough
to
break
one
s
heart
only
to
look
at
it
when
once
i
get
to
london
there
shall
be
no
more
solitude
for
my
poor
afflicted
friend
papa
will
be
free
from
his
parliamentary
duties
in
august
and
he
has
promised
to
have
the
house
full
of
delightful
people
to
meet
you
who
do
you
think
will
be
one
of
our
guests
he
is
illustrious
he
is
fascinating
he
deserves
a
line
all
to
himself
thus
the
reverend
miles
mirabel
lady
doris
has
discovered
that
the
country
parsonage
in
which
this
brilliant
clergyman
submits
to
exile
is
only
twelve
miles
away
from
our
house
she
has
written
to
mirabel
to
introduce
me
and
to
mention
the
date
of
my
return
we
will
have
some
fun
with
the
popular
preacher
we
will
both
fall
in
love
with
him
together
is
there
anybody
to
whom
you
would
like
me
to
send
an
invitation
shall
we
have
alban
morris
now
i
know
how
kindly
he
took
care
of
you
at
the
railway
station
your
good
opinion
of
him
is
my
opinion
your
letter
also
mentions
a
doctor
is
he
nice
and
do
you
think
he
will
let
me
eat
pastry
if
we
have
him
too
i
am
so
overflowing
with
hospitality
all
for
your
sake
that
i
am
ready
to
invite
anybody
and
everybody
to
cheer
you
and
make
you
happy
would
you
like
to
meet
miss
ladd
and
the
whole
school
as
to
our
amusements
make
your
mind
easy
i
have
come
to
a
distinct
understanding
with
papa
that
we
are
to
have
dances
every
evening
except
when
we
try
a
little
concert
as
a
change
private
theatricals
are
to
follow
when
we
want
another
change
after
the
dancing
and
the
music
no
early
rising
no
fixed
hour
for
breakfast
everything
that
is
most
exquisitely
delicious
at
dinner
and
to
crown
all
your
room
next
to
mine
for
delightful
midnight
gossipings
when
we
ought
to
be
in
bed
what
do
you
say
darling
to
the
programme
a
last
piece
of
news
and
i
have
done
i
have
actually
had
a
proposal
of
marriage
from
a
young
gentleman
who
sits
opposite
me
at
the
table
d
hote
when
i
tell
you
that
he
has
white
eyelashes
and
red
hands
and
such
enormous
front
teeth
that
he
can
t
shut
his
mouth
you
will
not
need
to
be
told
that
i
refused
him
this
vindictive
person
has
abused
me
ever
since
in
the
most
shameful
manner
i
heard
him
last
night
under
my
window
trying
to
set
one
of
his
friends
against
me
keep
clear
of
her
my
dear
fellow
she
s
the
most
heartless
creature
the
friend
took
my
part
he
said
i
don
t
agree
with
you
the
young
lady
is
a
person
of
great
nonsense
says
my
amiable
lover
she
eats
too
much
her
sensibility
is
all
there
s
a
wretch
for
you
what
a
shameful
advantage
to
take
of
sitting
opposite
to
me
at
dinner
my
love
till
we
meet
soon
and
are
as
happy
together
as
the
day
is
emily
kissed
the
signature
at
that
moment
of
all
others
cecilia
was
such
a
refreshing
contrast
to
francine
before
putting
the
letter
away
she
looked
again
at
that
part
of
it
which
mentioned
lady
doris
s
introduction
of
cecilia
to
mirabel
i
don
t
feel
the
slightest
interest
in
mirabel
she
thought
smiling
as
the
idea
occurred
to
her
and
i
need
never
have
known
him
but
for
lady
doris
who
is
a
perfect
stranger
to
she
had
just
placed
the
letter
in
her
desk
when
a
visitor
was
announced
doctor
allday
presented
himself
in
a
hurry
as
usual
another
patient
waiting
emily
asked
mischievously
no
time
to
spare
again
not
a
moment
the
old
gentleman
answered
have
you
heard
from
ellmother
you
don
t
mean
to
say
you
have
answered
her
i
have
done
better
than
that
doctor
i
have
seen
her
this
and
consented
to
be
her
reference
of
course
how
well
you
know
me
doctor
allday
was
a
philosopher
he
kept
his
temper
just
what
i
might
have
expected
he
said
eve
and
the
apple
only
forbid
a
woman
to
do
anything
and
she
does
it
directly
be
cause
you
have
forbidden
her
i
ll
try
the
other
way
with
you
now
miss
emily
there
was
something
else
that
i
meant
to
have
what
was
it
may
i
make
a
special
request
oh
my
dear
write
to
rook
i
beg
and
entreat
of
you
write
to
rook
emily
s
playful
manner
suddenly
disappeared
ignoring
the
doctor
s
little
outbreak
of
humor
she
waited
in
grave
surprise
until
it
was
his
pleasure
to
explain
himself
doctor
allday
on
his
side
ignored
the
ominous
change
in
emily
he
went
on
as
pleasantly
as
ever
mr
morris
and
i
have
had
a
long
talk
about
you
my
dear
morris
is
a
capital
fellow
i
recommend
him
as
a
sweetheart
i
also
back
him
in
the
matter
of
mrs
what
s
the
matter
now
you
re
as
red
as
a
rose
temper
again
eh
hatred
of
meanness
emily
answered
indignantly
i
despise
a
man
who
plots
behind
my
back
to
get
another
man
to
help
him
oh
how
i
have
been
mistaken
in
alban
morris
oh
how
little
you
know
of
the
best
friend
you
have
cried
the
doctor
imitating
her
girls
are
all
alike
the
only
man
they
can
understand
is
the
man
who
flatters
them
you
oblige
me
by
writing
to
rook
emily
made
an
attempt
to
match
the
doctor
with
his
own
weapons
your
little
joke
comes
too
late
she
said
satirically
there
is
rook
s
answer
read
it
and
she
checked
herself
even
in
her
anger
she
was
incapable
of
speaking
ungenerously
to
the
old
man
who
had
so
warmly
befriended
her
i
won
t
say
to
she
resumed
what
i
might
have
said
to
another
shall
i
say
it
for
you
asked
the
incorrigible
doctor
read
it
and
be
ashamed
of
yourself
that
was
what
you
had
in
your
mind
isn
t
it
anything
to
please
you
my
he
put
on
his
spectacles
read
the
letter
and
handed
it
back
to
emily
with
an
impenetrable
countenance
what
do
you
think
of
my
new
spectacles
he
asked
as
he
took
the
glasses
off
his
nose
in
the
experience
of
thirty
years
i
have
had
three
grateful
he
put
the
spectacles
back
in
the
case
this
comes
from
the
third
very
gratifying
very
emily
s
sense
of
humor
was
not
the
uppermost
sense
in
her
at
that
moment
she
pointed
with
a
peremptory
forefinger
to
rook
s
letter
have
you
nothing
to
say
about
this
the
doctor
had
so
little
to
say
about
it
that
he
was
able
to
express
himself
in
one
word
humbug
he
took
his
hat
nodded
kindly
to
emily
and
hurried
away
to
feverish
pulses
waiting
to
be
felt
and
to
furred
tongues
that
were
ashamed
to
show
themselves
chapter
xxxi
moira
when
alban
presented
himself
the
next
morning
the
hours
of
the
night
had
exercised
their
tranquilizing
influence
over
emily
she
remembered
sorrowfully
how
doctor
allday
had
disturbed
her
belief
in
the
man
who
loved
her
no
feeling
of
irritation
remained
alban
noticed
that
her
manner
was
unusually
subdued
she
received
him
with
her
customary
grace
but
not
with
her
customary
smile
are
you
not
well
he
asked
i
am
a
little
out
of
spirits
she
replied
a
disappointment
that
is
he
waited
a
moment
apparently
in
the
expectation
that
she
might
tell
him
what
the
disappointment
was
she
remained
silent
and
she
looked
away
from
him
was
he
in
any
way
answerable
for
the
depression
of
spirits
to
which
she
alluded
the
doubt
occurred
to
him
but
he
said
nothing
i
suppose
you
have
received
my
letter
she
resumed
i
have
come
here
to
thank
you
for
your
it
was
my
duty
to
tell
you
of
sir
jervis
s
illness
i
deserve
no
you
have
written
to
me
so
kindly
alban
reminded
her
you
have
referred
to
our
difference
of
opinion
the
last
time
i
was
here
so
gently
and
so
forgivingly
if
i
had
written
a
little
later
she
interposed
the
tone
of
my
letter
might
have
been
less
agreeable
to
you
i
happened
to
send
it
to
the
post
before
i
received
a
visit
from
a
friend
of
yours
a
friend
who
had
something
to
say
to
me
after
consulting
with
do
you
mean
doctor
allday
what
did
he
say
what
you
wished
him
to
say
he
did
his
best
he
was
as
obstinate
and
unfeeling
as
you
could
possibly
wish
him
to
be
but
he
was
too
late
i
have
written
to
rook
and
i
have
received
a
she
spoke
sadly
not
angrily
and
pointed
to
the
letter
lying
on
her
desk
alban
understood
he
looked
at
her
in
despair
is
that
wretched
woman
doomed
to
set
us
at
variance
every
time
we
meet
he
exclaimed
emily
silently
held
out
the
letter
he
refused
to
take
it
the
wrong
you
have
done
me
is
not
to
be
set
right
in
that
way
he
said
you
believe
the
doctor
s
visit
was
arranged
between
us
i
never
knew
that
he
intended
to
call
on
you
i
had
no
interest
in
sending
him
here
and
i
must
not
interfere
again
between
you
and
i
don
t
understand
you
will
understand
me
when
i
tell
you
how
my
conversation
with
doctor
allday
ended
i
have
done
with
interference
i
have
done
with
advice
whatever
my
doubts
may
be
all
further
effort
on
my
part
to
justify
them
all
further
inquiries
no
matter
in
what
direction
are
at
an
end
i
made
the
sacrifice
for
your
sake
no
i
must
repeat
what
you
said
to
me
just
now
i
deserve
no
thanks
what
i
have
done
has
been
done
in
deference
to
doctor
allday
against
my
own
convictions
in
spite
of
my
own
fears
ridiculous
convictions
ridiculous
fears
men
with
morbid
minds
are
their
own
tormentors
it
doesn
t
matter
how
i
suffer
so
long
as
you
are
at
ease
i
shall
never
thwart
you
or
vex
you
again
have
you
a
better
opinion
of
me
now
she
made
the
best
of
all
answers
she
gave
him
her
hand
may
i
kiss
it
he
asked
as
timidly
as
if
he
had
been
a
boy
addressing
his
first
sweetheart
she
was
half
inclined
to
laugh
and
half
inclined
to
cry
yes
if
you
like
she
said
softly
will
you
let
me
come
and
see
you
again
gladly
when
i
return
to
you
are
going
away
i
am
going
to
brighton
this
afternoon
to
stay
with
miss
it
was
hard
to
lose
her
on
the
happy
day
when
they
understood
each
other
at
last
an
expression
of
disappointment
passed
over
his
face
he
rose
and
walked
restlessly
to
the
window
miss
ladd
he
repeated
turning
to
emily
as
if
an
idea
had
struck
him
did
i
hear
at
the
school
that
miss
de
sor
was
to
spend
the
holidays
under
the
care
of
miss
ladd
the
same
young
lady
he
went
on
who
paid
you
a
visit
yesterday
morning
the
that
haunting
distrust
of
the
future
which
he
had
first
betrayed
and
then
affected
to
ridicule
exercised
its
depressing
influence
over
his
better
sense
he
was
unreasonable
enough
to
feel
doubtful
of
francine
simply
because
she
was
a
stranger
miss
de
sor
is
a
new
friend
of
yours
he
said
do
you
like
her
it
was
not
an
easy
question
to
answer
without
entering
into
particulars
which
emily
s
delicacy
of
feeling
warned
her
to
avoid
i
must
know
a
little
more
of
miss
de
sor
she
said
before
i
can
alban
s
misgivings
were
naturally
encouraged
by
this
evasive
reply
he
began
to
regret
having
left
the
cottage
on
the
previous
day
when
he
had
heard
that
emily
was
engaged
he
might
have
sent
in
his
card
and
might
have
been
admitted
it
was
an
opportunity
lost
of
observing
francine
on
the
morning
of
her
first
day
at
school
when
they
had
accidentally
met
at
the
summer
house
she
had
left
a
disagreeable
impression
on
his
mind
ought
he
to
allow
his
opinion
to
be
influenced
by
this
circumstance
or
ought
he
to
follow
emily
s
prudent
example
and
suspend
judgment
until
he
knew
a
little
more
of
francine
is
any
day
fixed
for
your
return
to
london
he
asked
not
yet
she
said
i
hardly
know
how
long
my
visit
will
in
little
more
than
a
fortnight
he
continued
i
shall
return
to
my
classes
they
will
be
dreary
classes
without
you
miss
de
sor
goes
back
to
the
school
with
miss
ladd
i
suppose
emily
was
at
a
loss
to
account
for
the
depression
in
his
looks
and
tones
while
he
was
making
these
unimportant
inquiries
she
tried
to
rouse
him
by
speaking
lightly
in
reply
miss
de
sor
returns
in
quite
a
new
character
she
is
to
be
a
guest
instead
of
a
pupil
do
you
wish
to
be
better
acquainted
with
her
yes
he
said
grave
ly
now
i
know
that
she
is
a
friend
of
he
returned
to
his
place
near
her
a
pleasant
visit
makes
the
days
pass
quickly
he
resumed
you
may
remain
at
brighton
longer
than
you
anticipate
and
we
may
not
meet
again
for
some
time
to
come
if
anything
happens
do
you
mean
anything
serious
she
asked
no
no
i
only
mean
if
i
can
be
of
any
service
in
that
case
will
you
write
to
me
you
know
i
will
she
looked
at
him
anxiously
he
had
completely
failed
to
hide
from
her
the
uneasy
state
of
his
mind
a
man
less
capable
of
concealment
of
feeling
never
lived
you
are
anxious
and
out
of
spirits
she
said
gently
is
it
my
fault
your
fault
oh
don
t
think
that
i
have
my
dull
days
and
my
bright
days
and
just
now
my
barometer
is
down
at
his
voice
faltered
in
spite
of
his
efforts
to
control
it
he
gave
up
the
struggle
and
took
his
hat
to
go
do
you
remember
emily
what
i
once
said
to
you
in
the
garden
at
the
school
i
still
believe
there
is
a
time
of
fulfillment
to
come
in
our
he
suddenly
checked
himself
as
if
there
had
been
something
more
in
his
mind
to
which
he
hesitated
to
give
expression
and
held
out
his
hand
to
bid
her
my
memory
of
what
you
said
in
the
garden
is
better
than
yours
she
reminded
him
you
said
happen
what
may
in
the
interval
i
trust
the
do
you
feel
the
same
trust
still
he
sighed
drew
her
to
him
gently
and
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
was
that
his
own
reply
she
was
not
calm
enough
to
ask
him
the
question
it
remained
in
her
thoughts
for
some
time
after
he
had
gone
on
the
same
day
emily
was
at
brighton
francine
happened
to
be
alone
in
the
her
first
proceeding
when
emily
was
shown
in
was
to
stop
the
servant
have
you
taken
my
letter
to
the
post
yes
it
doesn
t
she
dismissed
the
servant
by
a
gesture
and
burst
into
such
effusive
hospitality
that
she
actually
insisted
on
kissing
emily
do
you
know
what
i
have
been
doing
she
said
i
have
been
writing
to
cecilia
directing
to
the
care
of
her
father
at
the
house
of
commons
i
stupidly
forgot
that
you
would
be
able
to
give
me
the
right
address
in
switzerland
you
don
t
object
i
hope
to
my
making
myself
agreeable
to
our
dear
beautiful
greedy
girl
it
is
of
such
importance
to
me
to
surround
myself
with
influential
friends
and
of
course
i
have
given
her
your
love
don
t
look
disgusted
come
and
see
your
oh
never
mind
miss
ladd
you
will
see
her
when
she
wakes
ill
is
that
sort
of
old
woman
ever
ill
she
s
only
taking
her
nap
after
bathing
bathing
in
the
sea
at
her
age
how
she
must
frighten
the
fishes
having
seen
her
own
emily
was
next
introduced
to
the
room
occupied
by
francine
one
object
that
she
noticed
in
it
caused
her
some
little
surprise
not
unmingled
with
disgust
she
discovered
on
the
a
coarsely
caricatured
portrait
of
ellmother
it
was
a
sketch
in
pencil
wretchedly
drawn
but
spitefully
successful
as
a
likeness
i
didn
t
know
you
were
an
artist
emily
remarked
with
an
ironical
emphasis
on
the
last
word
francine
laughed
scornfully
crumpled
the
drawing
up
in
her
hand
and
threw
it
into
the
basket
you
satirical
creature
she
burst
out
gayly
if
you
had
lived
a
dull
life
at
domingo
you
would
have
taken
to
spoiling
paper
too
i
might
really
have
turned
out
an
artist
if
i
had
been
clever
and
industrious
like
you
as
it
was
i
learned
a
little
drawing
and
got
tired
of
it
i
tried
modeling
in
wax
and
got
tired
of
it
who
do
you
think
was
my
teacher
one
of
our
a
slave
emily
exclaimed
yes
a
mulatto
if
you
wish
me
to
be
particular
the
daughter
of
an
english
father
and
a
negro
mother
in
her
young
time
at
least
she
said
so
herself
she
was
quite
a
beauty
in
her
particular
style
her
master
s
favorite
he
educated
her
himself
besides
drawing
and
painting
and
modeling
in
wax
she
could
sing
and
play
all
the
accomplishments
thrown
away
on
a
slave
when
her
owner
died
my
uncle
bought
her
at
the
sale
of
the
a
word
of
natural
compassion
escaped
emily
to
francine
s
surprise
oh
my
dear
you
needn
t
pity
her
sappho
that
was
her
name
fetched
a
high
price
even
when
she
was
no
longer
young
she
came
to
us
by
inheritance
with
the
estates
and
the
rest
of
it
and
took
a
fancy
to
me
when
she
found
out
i
didn
t
get
on
well
with
my
father
and
mother
i
owe
it
to
father
and
mother
she
used
to
say
that
i
am
a
slave
when
i
see
affectionate
daughters
it
wrings
my
sappho
was
a
strange
compound
a
woman
with
a
white
side
to
her
character
and
a
black
side
for
weeks
together
she
would
be
a
civilized
being
then
she
used
to
relapse
and
become
as
complete
a
negress
as
her
mother
at
the
risk
of
her
life
she
stole
away
on
those
occasions
into
the
interior
of
the
island
and
looked
on
in
hiding
at
the
horrid
witchcrafts
and
idolatries
of
the
blacks
they
would
have
murdered
a
prying
into
their
ceremonies
if
they
had
discovered
her
i
followed
her
once
so
far
as
i
dared
the
frightful
yellings
and
drummings
in
the
darkness
of
the
forests
frightened
me
the
blacks
suspected
her
and
it
came
to
my
ears
i
gave
her
the
warning
that
saved
her
life
i
don
t
know
what
i
should
have
done
without
sappho
to
amuse
me
and
from
that
time
i
do
believe
the
curious
creature
loved
me
you
see
i
can
speak
generously
even
of
a
slave
i
wonder
you
didn
t
bring
her
with
you
to
england
emily
said
in
the
first
place
francine
answered
she
was
my
father
s
property
not
mine
in
the
second
place
she
s
dead
poisoned
as
the
other
supposed
by
some
enemy
among
the
blacks
she
said
herself
she
was
under
a
spell
what
did
she
mean
francine
was
not
interested
enough
in
the
subject
to
explain
stupid
superstition
my
dear
the
negro
side
of
sappho
was
uppermost
when
she
was
dying
there
is
the
explanation
be
off
with
you
i
hear
the
old
woman
on
the
stairs
meet
her
before
she
can
come
in
here
my
bedroom
is
my
only
refuge
from
miss
on
the
morning
of
the
last
day
in
the
week
emily
had
a
little
talk
in
private
with
her
old
schoolmistress
miss
ladd
listened
to
what
she
had
to
say
of
ellmother
and
did
her
best
to
relieve
emily
s
anxieties
i
think
you
are
mistaken
my
child
in
supposing
that
francine
is
in
earnest
it
is
her
great
fault
that
she
is
hardly
ever
in
earnest
you
can
trust
to
my
discretion
leave
the
rest
to
your
aunt
s
old
servant
and
to
ellmother
arrived
punctual
to
the
appointed
time
she
was
shown
into
miss
ladd
s
own
room
francine
ostentatiously
resolved
to
take
no
personal
part
in
the
affair
went
for
a
walk
emily
waited
to
hear
the
result
after
a
long
interval
miss
ladd
returned
to
the
and
announced
that
she
had
sanctioned
the
engagement
of
ellmother
i
have
considered
your
wishes
in
this
respect
she
said
it
is
arranged
that
a
week
s
notice
on
either
side
shall
end
the
term
of
service
after
the
first
month
i
can
not
feel
justified
in
doing
more
than
that
ellmother
is
such
a
respectable
woman
she
is
so
well
known
to
you
and
she
was
so
long
in
your
aunt
s
service
that
i
am
bound
to
consider
the
importance
of
securing
a
person
who
is
exactly
fitted
to
attend
on
such
a
girl
as
francine
in
one
word
i
can
trust
when
does
she
enter
on
her
service
emily
inquired
on
the
day
after
we
return
to
the
school
miss
ladd
replied
you
will
be
glad
to
see
her
i
am
sure
i
will
send
her
one
word
more
before
you
go
emily
said
did
you
ask
her
why
she
left
my
aunt
my
dear
child
a
woman
who
has
been
years
in
one
place
is
entitled
to
keep
her
own
secrets
i
understand
that
she
had
her
reasons
and
that
she
doesn
t
think
it
necessary
to
mention
them
to
anybody
never
trust
people
by
halves
especially
when
they
are
people
like
it
was
too
late
now
to
raise
any
objections
emily
felt
relieved
rather
than
disappointed
on
discovering
that
ellmother
was
in
a
hurry
to
get
back
to
london
by
the
next
train
sh
e
had
found
an
opportunity
of
letting
her
lodgings
and
she
was
eager
to
conclude
the
bargain
you
see
i
couldn
t
say
yes
she
explained
till
i
knew
whether
i
was
to
get
this
new
place
or
not
and
the
person
wants
to
go
in
emily
stopped
her
at
the
door
promise
to
write
and
tell
me
how
you
get
on
with
miss
de
you
say
that
miss
as
if
you
didn
t
feel
hopeful
about
i
say
it
because
i
feel
interested
about
you
promise
to
ellmother
promised
and
hastened
away
emily
looked
after
her
from
the
window
as
long
as
she
was
in
view
i
wish
i
could
feel
sure
of
francine
she
said
to
herself
in
what
way
asked
the
hard
voice
of
francine
speaking
at
the
door
it
was
not
in
emily
s
nature
to
shrink
from
a
plain
reply
she
completed
her
thought
without
a
moment
s
hesitation
i
wish
i
could
feel
sure
she
answered
that
you
will
be
kind
to
are
you
afraid
i
shall
make
her
life
one
scene
of
torment
francine
inquired
how
can
i
answer
for
myself
i
can
t
look
into
the
for
once
in
your
life
can
you
be
in
earnest
emily
said
for
once
in
your
life
can
you
take
a
joke
francine
replied
emily
said
no
more
she
privately
resolved
to
shorten
her
visit
to
brighton
book
the
third
netherwoods
chapter
xxxii
in
the
gray
room
the
house
inhabited
by
miss
ladd
and
her
pupils
had
been
built
in
the
early
part
of
the
present
century
by
a
wealthy
merchant
proud
of
his
money
and
eager
to
distinguish
himself
as
the
owner
of
the
largest
country
seat
in
the
neighborhood
after
his
death
miss
ladd
had
taken
netherwoods
as
the
place
was
called
finding
her
own
house
insufficient
for
the
accommodation
of
the
increasing
number
of
her
pupils
a
lease
was
granted
to
her
on
moderate
terms
netherwoods
failed
to
attract
persons
of
distinction
in
search
of
a
country
residence
the
grounds
were
beautiful
but
no
landed
property
not
even
a
park
was
attached
to
the
house
excepting
the
few
acres
on
which
the
building
stood
the
surrounding
land
belonged
to
a
retired
naval
officer
of
old
family
who
resented
the
attempt
of
a
merchant
of
low
birth
to
assume
the
position
of
a
gentleman
no
matter
what
proposals
might
be
made
to
the
admiral
he
refused
them
all
the
privilege
of
shooting
was
not
one
of
the
attractions
offered
to
tenants
the
country
presented
no
facilities
for
hunting
and
the
only
stream
in
the
neighborhood
was
not
preserved
in
consequence
of
these
drawbacks
the
merchant
s
representatives
had
to
choose
between
a
proposal
to
use
netherwoods
as
a
lunatic
asylum
or
to
accept
as
tenant
the
respectable
mistress
of
a
fashionable
and
prosperous
school
they
decided
in
favor
of
miss
ladd
the
contemplated
change
in
francine
s
position
was
accomplished
in
that
vast
house
without
inconvenience
there
were
rooms
unoccupied
even
when
the
limit
assigned
to
the
number
of
pupils
had
been
reached
on
the
of
the
school
francine
was
offered
her
choice
between
two
rooms
on
one
of
the
upper
stories
and
two
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
she
chose
these
last
her
and
bedroom
situated
at
the
back
of
the
house
communicated
with
each
other
the
ornamented
with
a
pretty
paper
of
delicate
gray
and
furnished
with
curtains
of
the
same
color
had
been
accordingly
named
the
gray
it
had
a
french
window
which
opened
on
the
terrace
overlooking
the
garden
and
the
grounds
some
fine
old
engravings
from
the
grand
landscapes
of
claude
part
of
a
collection
of
prints
possessed
by
miss
ladd
s
father
hung
on
the
walls
the
carpet
was
in
harmony
with
the
curtains
and
the
furniture
was
of
wood
which
helped
the
general
effect
of
subdued
brightness
that
made
the
charm
of
the
room
if
you
are
not
happy
here
miss
ladd
said
i
despair
of
and
francine
answered
yes
it
s
very
pretty
but
i
wish
it
was
not
so
on
the
twelfth
of
august
the
regular
routine
of
the
school
was
resumed
alban
morris
found
two
strangers
in
his
class
to
fill
the
vacancies
left
by
emily
and
cecilia
ellmother
was
duly
established
in
her
new
place
she
produced
an
unfavorable
impression
in
the
servants
hall
not
as
the
handsome
chief
housemaid
explained
because
she
was
ugly
and
old
but
because
she
was
a
person
who
didn
t
the
prejudice
against
habitual
silence
among
the
lower
order
of
the
people
is
almost
as
inveterate
as
the
prejudice
against
red
hair
in
the
evening
on
that
first
day
of
renewed
studies
while
the
girls
were
in
the
grounds
after
tea
francine
had
at
last
completed
the
arrangement
of
her
rooms
and
had
dismissed
ellmother
kept
hard
at
work
since
the
morning
to
take
a
little
rest
standing
alone
at
her
window
the
west
indian
heiress
wondered
what
she
had
better
do
next
she
glanced
at
the
girls
on
the
lawn
and
decided
that
they
were
unworthy
of
serious
notice
on
the
part
of
a
person
so
specially
favored
as
herself
she
turned
sidewise
and
looked
along
the
length
of
the
terrace
at
the
far
end
a
tall
man
was
slowly
pacing
to
and
fro
with
his
head
down
and
his
hands
in
his
pockets
francine
recognized
the
rude
who
had
torn
up
his
view
of
the
village
after
she
had
saved
it
from
being
blown
into
the
pond
she
stepped
out
on
the
terrace
and
called
to
him
he
stopped
and
looked
up
do
you
want
me
he
called
back
of
course
i
do
she
advanced
a
little
to
meet
him
and
offered
encouragement
under
the
form
of
a
hard
smile
although
his
manners
might
be
unpleasant
he
had
claims
on
the
indulgence
of
a
young
lady
who
was
at
a
loss
how
to
employ
her
idle
time
in
the
first
place
he
was
a
man
in
the
second
place
he
was
not
as
old
as
the
or
as
ugly
as
the
in
the
third
place
he
was
an
admirer
of
emily
and
the
opportunity
of
trying
to
shake
his
allegiance
by
means
of
a
flirtation
in
emily
s
absence
was
too
good
an
opportunity
to
be
lost
do
you
remember
how
rude
you
were
to
me
on
the
day
when
you
were
sketching
in
the
francine
asked
with
snappish
playfulness
i
expect
you
to
make
yourself
agreeable
this
time
i
am
going
to
pay
you
a
he
waited
with
exasperating
composure
to
hear
what
the
proposed
compliment
might
be
the
furrow
between
his
eyebrows
looked
deeper
than
ever
there
were
signs
of
secret
trouble
in
that
dark
face
so
grimly
and
so
resolutely
composed
the
school
without
emily
presented
the
severest
trial
of
endurance
that
he
had
encountered
since
the
day
when
he
had
been
deserted
and
disgraced
by
his
affianced
wife
you
are
an
artist
francine
proceeded
and
therefore
a
person
of
taste
i
want
to
have
your
opinion
of
my
criticism
is
invited
pray
come
he
seemed
to
be
unwilling
to
accept
the
invitation
then
altered
his
mind
and
followed
francine
she
had
visited
emily
she
was
perhaps
in
a
fair
way
to
become
emily
s
friend
he
remembered
that
he
had
already
lost
an
opportunity
of
studying
her
character
and
if
he
saw
the
necessity
of
warning
emily
not
to
encourage
the
advances
of
miss
de
sor
very
pretty
he
remarked
looking
round
the
room
without
appearing
to
care
for
anything
in
it
except
the
prints
francine
was
bent
on
fascinating
him
she
raised
her
eyebrows
and
lifted
her
hands
in
playful
remonstrance
do
remember
it
s
room
she
said
and
take
some
little
interest
in
it
for
sake
what
do
you
want
me
to
say
he
asked
come
and
sit
down
by
she
made
room
for
him
on
the
sofa
her
one
favorite
aspiration
the
longing
to
excite
envy
in
others
expressed
itself
in
her
next
words
say
something
pretty
she
answered
say
you
would
like
to
have
such
a
room
as
i
should
like
to
have
your
prints
he
remarked
will
that
do
it
wouldn
t
do
from
anybody
else
ah
morris
i
know
why
you
are
not
as
nice
as
you
might
be
you
are
not
happy
the
school
has
lost
its
one
attraction
in
losing
our
dear
emily
you
feel
it
i
know
you
feel
she
assisted
this
expression
of
sympathy
to
produce
the
right
effect
by
a
sigh
what
would
i
not
give
to
inspire
such
devotion
as
yours
i
don
t
envy
emily
i
only
wish
she
paused
in
confusion
and
opened
her
fan
isn
t
it
pretty
she
said
with
an
ostentatious
appearance
of
changing
the
subject
alban
behaved
like
a
monster
he
began
to
talk
of
the
weather
i
think
this
is
the
hottest
day
we
have
had
he
said
no
wonder
you
want
your
fan
netherwoods
is
an
airless
place
at
this
season
of
the
she
controlled
her
temper
i
do
indeed
feel
the
heat
she
admitted
with
a
resignation
which
gently
reproved
him
it
is
so
heavy
and
oppressive
here
after
brighton
perhaps
my
sad
life
far
away
from
home
and
friends
makes
me
sensitive
to
trifles
do
you
think
so
morris
the
merciless
man
said
he
thought
it
was
the
situation
of
the
house
miss
ladd
took
the
place
in
the
spring
he
continued
and
only
discovered
the
one
objection
to
it
some
months
afterward
we
are
in
the
highest
part
of
the
valley
here
but
you
see
it
s
a
valley
surrounded
by
hills
and
on
three
sides
the
hills
are
near
us
all
very
well
in
winter
but
in
summer
i
have
heard
of
girls
in
this
school
so
out
of
health
in
the
relaxing
atmosphere
that
they
have
been
sent
home
francine
suddenly
showed
an
interest
in
what
he
was
saying
if
he
had
cared
to
observe
her
closely
he
might
have
noticed
it
do
you
mean
that
the
girls
were
really
ill
she
asked
no
they
slept
badly
lost
appetite
started
at
trifling
noises
in
short
their
nerves
were
out
of
did
they
get
well
again
at
home
in
another
air
not
a
doubt
of
it
he
answered
beginning
to
get
weary
of
the
subject
may
i
look
at
your
books
francine
s
interest
in
the
influence
of
different
atmospheres
on
health
was
not
exhausted
yet
do
you
know
where
the
girls
lived
when
they
were
at
home
she
inquired
i
know
where
one
of
them
lived
she
was
the
best
pupil
i
ever
had
and
i
remember
she
lived
in
he
was
so
weary
of
the
idle
curiosity
as
it
appeared
to
him
which
persisted
in
asking
trifling
questions
that
he
left
his
seat
and
crossed
the
room
may
i
look
at
your
books
he
repeated
oh
yes
the
conversation
was
suspended
for
a
while
the
lady
thought
i
should
like
to
box
his
ears
the
gentleman
thought
she
s
only
an
inquisitive
fool
after
all
his
examination
of
her
books
confirmed
him
in
the
delusion
that
there
was
really
nothing
in
francine
s
character
which
rendered
it
necessary
to
caution
emily
against
the
advances
of
her
new
friend
turning
away
from
the
he
made
the
first
excuse
that
occurred
to
him
for
putting
an
end
to
the
interview
i
must
beg
you
to
let
me
return
to
my
duties
miss
de
sor
i
have
to
correct
the
young
ladies
drawings
before
they
begin
again
francine
s
wounded
vanity
made
a
last
expiring
attempt
to
steal
the
heart
of
emily
s
lover
you
remind
me
that
i
have
a
favor
to
ask
she
said
i
don
t
attend
the
other
classes
but
i
should
so
like
to
join
class
may
i
she
looked
up
at
him
with
a
languishing
appearance
of
entreaty
which
sorely
tried
alban
s
capacity
to
keep
his
face
in
serious
order
he
acknowledged
the
compliment
paid
to
him
in
studiously
commonplace
terms
and
got
a
little
nearer
to
the
open
window
francine
s
obstinacy
was
not
conquered
yet
my
education
has
been
sadly
neglected
she
continued
but
i
have
had
some
little
instruction
in
drawing
you
will
not
find
me
so
ignorant
as
some
of
the
other
she
waited
a
little
anticipating
a
few
complimentary
words
alban
waited
also
in
silence
i
shall
look
forward
with
pleasure
to
my
lessons
under
such
an
artist
as
yourself
she
went
on
and
waited
again
and
was
disappointed
again
perhaps
she
resumed
i
may
become
your
favorite
pupil
who
knows
who
indeed
it
was
not
much
to
say
when
he
spoke
at
last
but
it
was
enough
to
encourage
francine
she
called
him
dear
morris
she
pleaded
for
permission
to
take
her
first
lesson
immediately
she
clasped
her
hands
please
say
yes
i
can
t
say
yes
till
you
have
complied
with
the
are
they
rules
her
eyes
expressed
the
readiest
submission
in
that
case
he
entirely
failed
to
see
it
he
said
they
were
miss
ladd
s
rules
and
wished
her
she
watched
him
walking
away
down
the
terrace
how
was
he
paid
did
he
receive
a
yearly
salary
or
did
he
get
a
little
extra
money
for
each
new
pupil
who
took
drawing
lessons
in
this
last
case
francine
saw
her
opportunity
of
being
even
with
him
you
brute
catch
me
attending
your
class
chapter
xxxiii
recollections
of
domingo
the
night
was
oppressively
hot
finding
it
impossible
to
sleep
francine
lay
quietly
in
her
bed
thinking
the
subject
of
her
reflections
was
a
person
who
occupied
the
humble
position
of
her
new
servant
ellmother
looked
wretchedly
ellmother
had
told
emily
that
her
object
in
returning
to
domestic
service
was
to
try
if
change
would
relieve
her
from
the
oppression
of
her
own
thoughts
ellmother
believed
in
vulgar
superstitions
which
declared
friday
to
be
an
unlucky
day
and
which
recommended
throwing
a
pinch
over
your
left
shoulder
if
you
happened
to
spill
the
salt
in
themselves
these
were
trifling
recollections
but
they
assumed
a
certain
importance
derived
from
the
associations
which
they
called
forth
they
reminded
francine
by
some
mental
process
which
she
was
at
a
loss
to
trace
of
sappho
the
slave
and
of
her
life
at
domingo
she
struck
a
light
and
unlocked
her
writing
desk
from
one
of
the
drawers
she
took
out
an
old
household
the
first
page
contained
some
entries
relating
to
domestic
expenses
in
her
own
handwriting
they
recalled
one
of
her
efforts
to
occupy
her
idle
time
by
relieving
her
mother
of
the
cares
of
housekeeping
for
a
day
or
two
she
had
persevered
and
then
she
had
ceased
to
feel
any
interest
in
her
new
employment
the
remainder
of
the
book
was
completely
filled
up
in
a
beautifully
clear
handwriting
beginning
on
the
second
page
a
title
had
been
found
for
the
manuscript
by
francine
she
had
written
at
the
top
of
the
page
s
after
reading
the
first
few
sentences
she
rapidly
turned
over
the
leaves
and
stopped
at
a
blank
space
near
the
end
of
the
book
here
again
she
had
added
a
title
this
time
it
implied
a
compliment
to
the
writer
the
page
was
headed
s
she
read
this
latter
part
of
the
manuscript
with
the
closest
attention
i
entreat
my
kind
and
dear
young
mistress
not
to
suppose
that
i
believe
in
witchcraft
after
such
an
education
as
i
have
received
when
i
wrote
down
at
your
biding
all
that
i
had
told
you
by
word
of
mouth
i
can
not
imagine
what
delusion
possessed
me
you
say
i
have
a
negro
side
to
my
character
which
i
inherit
from
my
mother
did
you
mean
this
dear
mistress
as
a
joke
i
am
almost
afraid
it
is
sometimes
not
far
off
from
the
truth
let
me
be
careful
however
to
avoid
leading
you
into
a
mistake
it
is
really
true
that
the
i
spoke
of
did
pine
and
die
after
the
spell
had
been
cast
on
him
by
my
s
image
of
wax
but
i
ought
also
to
have
told
you
that
circumstances
favored
the
working
of
the
spell
the
fatal
end
was
not
brought
about
by
supernatural
means
the
poor
wretch
was
not
in
good
health
at
the
time
and
our
owner
had
occasion
to
employ
him
in
the
valley
of
the
island
far
inland
i
have
been
told
and
can
well
believe
that
the
climate
there
is
different
from
the
climate
on
the
coast
in
which
the
unfortunate
slave
had
been
accustomed
to
live
the
overseer
wouldn
t
believe
him
when
he
said
the
valley
air
would
be
his
death
and
the
negroes
who
might
otherwise
have
helped
him
all
avoided
a
man
whom
they
knew
to
be
under
a
spell
this
you
see
accounts
for
what
might
appear
incredible
to
civilized
persons
if
you
will
do
me
a
favor
you
will
burn
this
little
book
as
soon
as
you
have
read
what
i
have
written
here
if
my
request
is
not
granted
i
can
only
implore
you
to
let
no
eyes
but
your
own
see
these
pages
my
life
might
be
in
danger
if
the
blacks
knew
what
i
have
now
told
you
in
the
interests
of
francine
closed
the
book
and
locked
it
up
again
in
her
desk
now
i
know
she
said
to
herself
what
reminded
me
of
when
francine
rang
her
bell
the
next
morning
so
long
a
time
elapsed
without
producing
an
answer
that
she
began
to
think
of
sending
one
of
the
to
make
inquiries
before
she
could
decide
ellmother
presented
herself
and
offered
her
apologies
it
s
the
first
time
i
have
overslept
myself
miss
since
i
was
a
girl
please
to
excuse
me
it
shan
t
happen
do
you
find
that
the
air
here
makes
you
drowsy
francine
asked
ellmother
shook
her
head
i
didn
t
get
to
sleep
she
said
till
morning
and
so
i
was
too
heavy
to
be
up
in
time
but
air
has
got
nothing
to
do
with
it
gentlefolks
may
have
their
whims
and
fancies
all
air
is
the
same
to
people
like
you
enjoy
good
health
ellmother
why
not
miss
i
have
never
had
a
oh
that
s
your
opinion
of
doctors
is
it
i
won
t
have
anything
to
do
with
them
if
that
s
what
you
mean
by
my
opinion
ellmother
answered
doggedly
how
will
you
have
your
hair
done
the
same
as
yesterday
have
you
seen
anything
of
miss
emily
she
went
back
to
london
the
day
after
you
left
i
haven
t
been
in
london
i
m
thankful
to
say
my
lodgings
are
let
to
a
good
then
where
have
you
lived
while
you
were
waiting
to
come
here
i
had
only
one
place
to
go
to
miss
i
went
to
the
village
where
i
was
born
a
friend
found
a
corner
for
me
ah
dear
heart
it
s
a
pleasant
place
there
a
place
like
this
lord
help
you
as
little
like
this
as
chalk
is
to
cheese
a
fine
big
moor
miss
in
cumberland
without
a
tree
in
sight
look
where
you
may
something
like
a
wind
i
can
tell
you
when
it
takes
to
blowing
have
you
never
been
in
this
part
of
the
country
not
i
when
i
left
the
north
my
new
mistress
took
me
to
canada
talk
about
air
if
there
was
anything
in
it
the
people
in
air
ought
to
live
to
be
a
hundred
i
liked
and
who
was
your
next
mistress
thus
far
ellmother
had
been
ready
enough
to
talk
had
she
failed
to
hear
what
francine
had
just
said
to
her
or
had
she
some
reason
for
feeling
reluctant
to
answer
in
any
case
a
spirit
of
taciturnity
took
sudden
possession
of
her
she
was
silent
francine
as
usual
persisted
was
your
next
place
in
service
with
miss
emily
s
aunt
did
the
old
lady
always
live
in
london
what
part
of
the
country
did
she
live
in
among
the
hop
gardens
in
what
other
part
then
isle
of
near
the
sea
coast
even
francine
could
insist
no
longer
ellmother
s
reserve
had
beaten
her
for
that
day
at
least
go
into
the
hall
she
said
and
see
if
there
are
any
letters
for
me
in
the
there
was
a
letter
bearing
the
swiss
postmark
simple
cecilia
was
flattered
and
delighted
by
the
charming
manner
in
which
francine
had
written
to
her
she
looked
forward
with
impatience
to
the
time
when
their
present
acquaintance
might
ripen
into
friendship
would
dear
miss
de
sor
waive
all
ceremony
and
consent
to
be
a
guest
later
in
the
autumn
at
her
father
s
house
circumstances
connected
with
her
sister
s
health
would
delay
their
return
to
england
for
a
little
while
by
the
end
of
the
month
she
hoped
to
be
at
home
again
and
to
hear
if
francine
was
disengaged
her
address
in
england
was
monksmoor
park
hants
having
read
the
letter
francine
drew
a
moral
from
it
there
is
great
use
in
a
fool
when
one
knows
how
to
manage
having
little
appetite
for
her
breakfast
she
tried
the
experiment
of
a
walk
on
the
terrace
alban
morris
was
right
the
air
at
netherwoods
in
the
summer
time
relaxing
the
morning
mist
still
hung
over
the
lowest
part
of
the
valley
between
the
village
and
the
hills
beyond
a
little
exercise
produced
a
feeling
of
fatigue
francine
returned
to
her
room
and
trifled
with
her
tea
and
toast
her
next
proceeding
was
to
open
her
and
look
into
the
old
once
more
while
it
lay
open
on
her
lap
she
recalled
what
had
passed
that
morning
between
ellmother
and
herself
the
old
woman
had
been
born
and
bred
in
the
north
on
an
open
moor
she
had
been
removed
to
the
keen
air
of
canada
when
she
left
her
birthplace
she
had
been
in
service
after
that
on
the
breezy
eastward
coast
of
kent
would
the
change
to
the
climate
of
netherwoods
produce
any
effect
on
ellmother
at
her
age
and
with
her
seasoned
constitution
would
she
feel
it
as
those
had
felt
it
especially
that
one
among
them
who
lived
in
the
bracing
air
of
the
north
the
air
of
yorkshire
weary
of
solitary
thinking
on
one
subject
francine
returned
to
the
terrace
with
a
vague
idea
of
finding
something
to
amuse
her
that
is
to
say
something
she
could
turn
into
ridicule
if
she
joined
the
girls
the
next
morning
ellmother
answered
her
mistress
s
bell
without
delay
you
have
slept
better
this
time
francine
said
no
miss
when
i
did
get
to
sleep
i
was
troubled
by
dreams
another
bad
night
and
no
mistake
i
suspect
your
mind
is
not
quite
at
ease
francine
suggested
why
do
you
suspect
that
if
you
please
you
talked
when
i
met
you
at
miss
emily
s
of
wanting
to
get
away
from
your
own
thoughts
has
the
change
to
this
place
helped
you
it
hasn
t
helped
me
as
i
expected
some
people
s
thoughts
stick
remorseful
thoughts
francine
inquired
ellmother
held
up
her
forefinger
and
shook
it
with
a
gesture
of
reproof
i
thought
we
agreed
miss
that
there
was
to
be
no
the
business
of
the
toilet
proceeded
in
silence
a
week
passed
during
an
interval
in
the
labors
of
the
school
miss
ladd
knocked
at
the
door
of
francine
s
room
i
want
to
speak
to
you
my
dear
about
ellmother
have
you
noticed
that
she
doesn
t
seem
to
be
in
good
health
she
looks
rather
pale
miss
it
s
more
serious
than
that
francine
the
servants
tell
me
that
she
has
hardly
any
appetite
she
herself
acknowledges
that
she
sleeps
badly
i
noticed
her
yesterday
evening
in
the
garden
under
the
schoolroom
window
one
of
the
girls
dropped

she
started
at
that
slight
noise
as
if
it
terrified
her
her
nerves
are
seriously
out
of
order
can
you
prevail
upon
her
to
see
the
doctor
francine
hesitated
and
made
an
excuse
i
think
she
would
be
much
more
likely
miss
ladd
to
listen
to
you
do
you
mind
speaking
to
her
certainly
not
ellmother
was
immediately
sent
for
what
is
your
pleasure
miss
she
said
to
francine
miss
ladd
interposed
it
is
i
who
wish
to
speak
to
you
ellmother
for
some
days
past
i
have
been
sorry
to
see
you
looking
i
never
was
ill
in
my
life
ma
miss
ladd
gently
persisted
i
hear
that
you
have
lost
your
i
never
was
a
great
eater
ma
it
was
evidently
useless
to
risk
any
further
allusion
to
ellmother
s
symptoms
miss
ladd
tried
another
method
of
persuasion
i
daresay
i
may
be
mistaken
she
said
but
i
do
really
feel
anxious
about
you
to
set
my
mind
at
rest
will
you
see
the
doctor
the
doctor
do
you
think
i
m
going
to
begin
taking
physic
at
my
time
of
life
lord
ma
am
you
amuse
me
you
do
indeed
she
burst
into
a
sudden
fit
of
laughter
the
hysterical
laughter
which
is
on
the
verge
of
tears
with
a
desperate
effort
she
controlled
herself
please
don
t
make
a
fool
of
me
again
she
said
and
left
the
room
what
do
you
think
now
miss
ladd
asked
francine
appeared
to
be
still
on
her
guard
i
don
t
know
what
to
think
she
said
evasively
miss
ladd
looked
at
her
in
silent
surprise
and
withdrew
left
by
herself
francine
sat
with
her
elbows
on
the
table
and
her
face
in
her
hands
absorbed
in
thought
after
a
long
interval
she
opened
her
desk
and
hesitated
she
took
a
sheet
of
and
paused
as
if
still
in
doubt
she
snatched
up
her
pen
with
a
sudden
recovery
of
resolution
and
addressed
these
lines
to
the
wife
of
her
father
s
agent
in
london
when
i
was
placed
under
your
care
on
the
night
of
my
arrival
from
the
west
indies
you
kindly
said
i
might
ask
you
for
any
little
service
which
might
be
within
your
power
i
shall
be
greatly
obliged
if
you
can
obtain
for
me
and
send
to
this
place
a
supply
of
artists
modeling
wax
sufficient
for
the
product
ion
of
a
small
chapter
xxxiv
in
the
dark
a
week
later
alban
morris
happened
to
be
in
miss
ladd
s
study
with
a
report
to
make
on
the
subject
of
his
ellmother
interrupted
them
for
a
moment
she
entered
the
room
to
return
a
book
which
francine
had
borrowed
that
morning
has
miss
de
sor
done
with
it
already
miss
ladd
asked
she
won
t
read
it
ma
am
she
says
the
leaves
smell
of
miss
ladd
turned
to
alban
and
shook
her
head
with
an
air
of
reproof
i
know
who
has
been
reading
that
book
last
she
said
alban
pleaded
guilty
by
a
look
he
was
the
only
master
in
the
school
who
smoked
as
ellmother
passed
him
on
her
way
out
he
noticed
the
signs
of
suffering
in
her
wasted
face
that
woman
is
surely
in
a
bad
state
of
health
he
said
has
she
seen
the
doctor
she
flatly
refuses
to
consult
the
doctor
miss
ladd
replied
if
she
was
a
stranger
i
should
meet
the
difficulty
by
telling
miss
de
sor
whose
servant
she
is
that
ellmother
must
be
sent
home
but
i
can
not
act
in
that
peremptory
manner
toward
a
person
in
whom
emily
is
from
that
moment
ellmother
became
a
person
in
whom
alban
was
interested
later
in
the
day
he
met
her
in
one
of
the
lower
corridors
of
the
house
and
spoke
to
her
i
am
afraid
the
air
of
this
place
doesn
t
agree
with
you
he
said
ellmother
s
irritable
objection
to
being
told
even
indirectly
that
she
looked
ill
expressed
itself
roughly
in
reply
i
daresay
you
mean
well
sir
but
i
don
t
see
how
it
matters
to
you
whether
the
place
agrees
with
me
or
wait
a
minute
alban
answered
i
am
not
quite
a
stranger
to
how
do
you
make
that
out
if
you
please
i
know
a
young
lady
who
has
a
sincere
regard
for
you
don
t
mean
miss
emily
yes
i
do
i
respect
and
admire
miss
emily
and
i
have
tried
in
my
poor
way
to
be
of
some
little
service
to
ellmother
s
haggard
face
instantly
softened
please
to
forgive
me
sir
for
forgetting
my
manners
she
said
simply
i
have
had
my
health
since
the
day
i
was
born
and
i
don
t
like
to
be
told
in
my
old
age
that
a
new
place
doesn
t
agree
with
alban
accepted
this
apology
in
a
manner
which
at
once
won
the
heart
of
the
he
shook
hands
with
her
you
re
one
of
the
right
sort
she
said
there
are
not
many
of
them
in
this
was
she
alluding
to
francine
alban
tried
to
make
the
discovery
polite
circumlocution
would
be
evidently
thrown
away
on
ellmother
is
your
new
mistress
one
of
the
right
sort
he
asked
bluntly
the
old
servant
s
answer
was
expressed
by
a
frowning
look
followed
by
a
plain
question
do
you
say
that
sir
because
you
like
my
new
mistress
please
to
shake
hands
again
she
said
it
took
his
hand
with
a
sudden
grip
that
spoke
for
itself
and
walked
away
here
was
an
exhibition
of
character
which
alban
was
just
the
man
to
appreciate
if
i
had
been
an
old
woman
he
thought
in
his
dryly
humorous
way
i
believe
i
should
have
been
like
ellmother
we
might
have
talked
of
emily
if
she
had
not
left
me
in
such
a
hurry
when
shall
i
see
her
again
he
was
destined
to
see
her
again
that
night
under
circumstances
which
he
remembered
to
the
end
of
his
life
the
rules
of
netherwoods
in
summer
time
recalled
the
young
ladies
from
their
evening
s
recreation
in
the
grounds
at
nine
o
clock
after
that
hour
alban
was
free
to
smoke
his
pipe
and
to
linger
among
trees
and
before
he
returned
to
his
hot
little
rooms
in
the
village
as
a
relief
to
the
drudgery
of
teaching
the
young
ladies
he
had
been
using
his
pencil
when
the
day
s
lessons
were
over
for
his
own
amusement
it
was
past
ten
o
clock
before
he
lighted
his
pipe
and
began
walking
slowly
to
and
fro
on
the
path
which
led
to
the
at
the
southern
limit
of
the
grounds
in
the
perfect
stillness
of
the
night
the
clock
of
the
village
church
was
distinctly
audible
striking
the
hours
and
the
quarters
the
moon
had
not
risen
but
the
mysterious
glimmer
of
starlight
trembled
on
the
large
open
space
between
the
trees
and
the
house
alban
paused
admiring
with
an
artist
s
eye
the
effect
of
light
so
faintly
and
delicately
beautiful
on
the
broad
expanse
of
the
lawn
does
the
man
live
who
could
paint
that
he
asked
himself
his
memory
recalled
the
works
of
the
greatest
of
all
landscape
painters
the
english
artists
of
fifty
years
since
while
recollections
of
many
a
noble
picture
were
still
passing
through
his
mind
he
was
startled
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
bareheaded
woman
on
the
terrace
steps
she
hurried
down
to
the
lawn
staggering
as
she
ran
stopped
and
looked
back
at
the
house
hastened
onward
toward
the
trees
stopped
again
looking
backward
and
forward
uncertain
which
way
to
turn
next
and
then
advanced
once
more
he
could
now
hear
her
heavily
gasping
for
breath
as
she
came
nearer
the
starlight
showed
a
face
the
face
of
ellmother
alban
ran
to
meet
her
she
dropped
on
the
grass
before
he
could
cross
the
short
distance
which
separated
them
as
he
raised
her
in
his
arms
she
looked
at
him
wildly
and
murmured
and
muttered
in
the
vain
attempt
to
speak
look
at
me
again
he
said
don
t
you
remember
the
man
who
had
some
talk
with
you
she
still
stared
at
him
vacantly
he
tried
again
don
t
you
remember
miss
emily
s
friend
as
the
name
passed
his
lips
her
mind
in
some
degree
recovered
its
balance
yes
she
said
emily
s
friend
i
m
glad
i
have
met
with
emily
s
she
caught
at
alban
s
arm
starting
as
if
her
own
words
had
alarmed
her
what
am
i
talking
about
did
i
say
emily
a
servant
ought
to
say
miss
my
head
swims
am
i
going
mad
alban
led
her
to
one
of
the
garden
chairs
you
re
only
a
little
frightened
he
said
rest
and
compose
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
toward
the
house
not
here
i
ve
run
away
from
a
i
want
to
be
out
of
sight

friend

t

that
i

my
other
name

morris
she
repeated
ah
i
ve
heard
of
people
called
look
back
your
eyes
are
young
do
you
see
her
on
the
terrace
there
isn
t
a
living
soul
to
be
seen
with
one
hand
he
raised
her
as
he
spoke
and
with
the
other
he
took
up
the
chair
in
a
minute
more
they
were
out
of
sight
of
the
house
he
seated
her
so
that
she
could
rest
her
head
against
the
trunk
of
a
tree
what
a
good
fellow
the
poor
old
creature
said
admiring
him
he
knows
how
my
head
pains
me
don
t
stand
up
you
re
a
tall
man
she
might
see
she
can
see
nothing
look
at
the
trees
behind
us
even
the
starlight
doesn
t
get
through
ellmother
was
not
satisfied
yet
you
take
it
coolly
she
said
do
you
know
who
saw
us
together
in
the
passage
you
good
morris
saw
us
she
did
wretch
cruel
cunning
shameless
in
the
shadows
that
were
round
them
alban
could
just
see
that
she
was
shaking
her
clinched
fists
in
the
air
he
made
another
attempt
to
control
her
don
t
excite
yourself
if
she
comes
into
the
garden
she
might
hear
the
appeal
to
her
fears
had
its
effect
that
s
true
she
said
in
lowered
tones
a
sudden
distrust
of
him
seized
her
the
next
moment
who
told
me
i
was
excited
she
burst
out
it
s
you
who
are
excited
deny
it
if
you
dare
i
begin
to
suspect
you
morris
i
don
t
like
your
conduct
what
has
become
of
your
pipe
i
saw
you
put
your
pipe
in
your
coat
pocket
you
did
it
when
you
set
me
down
among
the
trees
where
could
see
me
you
are
in
league
with
her
she
is
coming
to
meet
you
here
you
know
she
does
not
like
are
you
two
going
to
put
me
in
the
madhouse
she
started
to
her
feet
it
occurred
to
alban
that
the
speediest
way
of
pacifying
her
might
be
by
means
of
the
pipe
mere
words
would
exercise
no
persuasive
influence
over
that
bewildered
mind
instant
action
of
some
kind
would
be
far
more
likely
to
have
the
right
effect
he
put
his
pipe
and
his
tobacco
pouch
into
her
hands
and
so
mastered
her
attention
before
he
spoke
do
you
know
how
to
fill
a
man
s
pipe
for
him
he
asked
haven
t
i
filled
my
husband
s
pipe
hundreds
of
times
she
answered
sharply
very
well
now
do
it
for
she
took
her
chair
again
instantly
and
filled
the
pipe
he
lighted
it
and
seated
himself
on
the
grass
quietly
smoking
do
you
think
i
m
in
league
with
her
now
he
asked
purposely
adopting
the
rough
tone
of
a
man
in
her
own
rank
of
life
she
answered
him
as
she
might
have
answered
her
husband
in
the
days
of
her
unhappy
marriage
oh
don
t
gird
at
me
there
s
a
good
man
if
i
ve
been
off
my
head
for
a
minute
or
two
please
not
to
notice
me
it
s
cool
and
quiet
here
the
poor
woman
said
gratefully
bless
god
for
the
darkness
there
s
something
comforting
in
the
darkness
along
with
a
good
man
like
you
give
me
a
word
of
advice
you
are
my
friend
in
need
what
am
i
to
do
i
daren
t
go
back
to
the
house
she
was
quiet
enough
now
to
suggest
the
hope
that
she
might
be
able
to
give
alban
some
information
were
you
with
miss
de
sor
he
asked
before
you
came
out
here
what
did
she
do
to
frighten
you
there
was
no
answer
ellmother
had
abruptly
risen
once
more
hush
she
whispered
don
t
i
hear
somebody
near
us
alban
at
once
went
back
along
the
winding
path
which
they
had
followed
no
creature
was
visible
in
the
gardens
or
on
the
terrace
on
returning
he
found
it
impossible
to
use
his
eyes
to
any
good
purpose
in
the
obscurity
among
the
trees
he
waited
a
while
listening
intently
no
sound
was
audible
there
was
not
even
air
enough
to
stir
the
leaves
as
he
returned
to
the
place
that
he
had
left
the
silence
was
broken
by
the
chimes
of
the
distant
church
clock
striking
the
past
ten
even
that
familiar
sound
jarred
on
ellmother
s
shattered
nerves
in
her
state
of
mind
and
body
she
was
evidently
at
the
mercy
of
any
false
alarm
which
might
be
raised
by
her
own
fears
relieved
of
the
feeling
of
distrust
which
had
thus
far
troubled
him
alban
sat
down
by
her
again
opened
his
to
relight
his
pipe
and
changed
his
mind
ellmother
had
unconsciously
warned
him
to
be
cautious
for
the
first
time
he
thought
it
likely
that
the
heat
in
the
house
might
induce
some
of
the
inmates
to
try
the
cooler
atmosphere
in
the
grounds
if
this
happened
and
if
he
continued
to
smoke
curiosity
might
tempt
them
to
follow
the
scent
of
tobacco
hanging
on
the
stagnant
air
is
there
nobody
near
us
ellmother
asked
are
you
sure
quite
sure
now
tell
me
did
you
really
mean
it
when
you
said
just
now
that
you
wanted
my
advice
need
you
ask
that
sir
who
else
have
i
got
to
help
me
i
am
ready
and
willing
to
help
you
but
i
can
t
do
it
unless
i
know
first
what
has
passed
between
you
and
miss
de
sor
will
you
trust
me
i
will
may
i
depend
on
you
try

chapter
xxxv
the
treachery
of
the
pipe
alban
took
ellmother
at
her
word
i
am
going
to
venture
on
a
guess
he
said
you
have
been
with
miss
de
sor
quite
true
i
am
going
to
guess
again
did
miss
de
sor
ask
you
to
stay
with
her
when
you
went
into
her
room
that
s
it
she
rang
for
me
to
see
how
i
was
getting
on
with
my
needlework
and
she
was
what
i
call
hearty
for
the
first
time
since
i
have
been
in
her
service
i
didn
t
think
badly
of
her
when
she
first
talked
of
engaging
me
and
i
ve
had
reason
to
repent
of
my
opinion
ever
since
oh
she
showed
the
cloven
foot
sit
down
she
says
i
ve
nothing
to
read
and
i
hate
work
let
s
have
a
little
she
s
got
a
glib
tongue
of
her
own
all
i
could
do
was
to
say
a
word
now
and
then
to
keep
her
going
she
talked
and
talked
till
it
was
time
to
light
the
lamp
she
was
particular
in
telling
me
to
put
the
shade
over
it
we
were
half
in
the
dark
and
half
in
the
light
she
trapped
me
lord
knows
how
into
talking
about
foreign
parts
i
mean
the
place
she
lived
in
before
they
sent
her
to
england
have
you
heard
that
she
comes
from
the
west
indies
yes
i
have
heard
that
go
wait
a
bit
sir

s
something
by
your
leave
that
i
want
to
know
do
you
believe
in
witchcraft
i
know
nothing
about
it
did
miss
de
sor
put
that
question
to
you
she
and
how
did
you
answer
neither
in
one
way
nor
the
other
i
m
in
two
minds
about
that
matter
of
witchcraft
when
i
was
a
girl
there
was
an
old
woman
in
our
village
who
was
a
sort
of
show
people
came
to
see
her
from
all
the
country
round
gentlefolks
among
them
it
was
her
great
age
that
made
her
famous
more
than
a
hundred
years
old
sir
one
of
our
neighbors
didn
t
believe
in
her
age
and
she
heard
of
it
she
cast
a
spell
on
his
flock
i
tell
you
she
sent
a
plague
on
his
sheep
the
plague
of
the
bots
the
whole
flock
died
i
remember
it
well
some
said
the
sheep
would
have
had
the
bots
anyhow
some
said
it
was
the
spell
which
of
them
was
right
how
am
i
to
settle
it
did
you
mention
this
to
miss
de
sor
i
was
obliged
to
mention
it
didn
t
i
tell
you
just
now
that
i
can
t
make
up
my
mind
about
witchcraft
you
don
t
seem
to
know
whether
you
believe
or
disbelieve
she
says
it
made
me
look
like
a
fool
i
told
her
i
had
my
reasons
and
then
i
was
obliged
to
give
and
what
did
she
do
then
she
said
i
ve
got
a
better
story
of
witchcraft
than
and
she
opened
a
little
book
with
a
lot
of
writing
in
it
and
began
to
read
her
story
made
my
flesh
creep
it
turns
me
cold
sir
when
i
think
of
it
he
heard
her
moaning
and
shuddering
strongly
as
his
interest
was
excited
there
was
a
compassionate
reluctance
in
him
to
ask
her
to
go
on
his
merciful
scruples
proved
to
be
needless
the
fascination
of
beauty
it
is
possible
to
resist
the
fascination
of
horror
fastens
its
fearful
hold
on
us
struggle
against
it
as
we
may
ellmother
repeated
what
she
had
heard
in
spite
of
herself
it
happened
in
the
west
indies
she
said
and
the
writing
of
a
woman
slave
was
the
writing
in
the
little
book
the
slave
wrote
about
her
mother
her
mother
was
a
black
a
witch
in
her
own
country
there
was
a
forest
in
her
own
country
the
devil
taught
her
witchcraft
in
the
forest
the
serpents
and
the
wild
beasts
were
afraid
to
touch
her
she
lived
without
eating
she
was
sold
for
a
slave
and
sent
to
the
island
an
island
in
the
west
indies
an
old
man
lived
there
the
wickedest
man
of
them
all
he
filled
the
black
witch
with
devilish
knowledge
she
learned
to
make
the
image
of
wax
the
image
of
wax
casts
spells
you
put
pins
in
the
image
of
wax
at
every
pin
you
put
the
person
under
the
spell
gets
nearer
and
nearer
to
death
there
was
a
poor
black
in
the
island
he
offended
the
witch
she
made
his
image
in
wax
she
cast
spells
on
him
he
couldn
t
sleep
he
couldn
t
eat
he
was
such
a
coward
that
common
noises
frightened
him
like
me
oh
god
like
me
wait
a
little
alban
interposed
you
are
exciting
yourself
again
you
re
wrong
sir
you
think
it
ended
when
she
finished
her
story
and
shut
up
her
book
there
s
worse
to
come
than
anything
you
ve
heard
yet
i
don
t
know
what
i
did
to
offend
her
she
looked
at
me
and
spoke
to
me
as
if
i
was
the
dirt
under
her
feet
if
you
re
too
stupid
to
understand
what
i
have
been
reading
she
says
get
up
and
go
to
the
glass
look
at
yourself
and
remember
what
happened
to
the
slave
who
was
under
the
spell
you
re
getting
paler
and
paler
and
thinner
and
thinner
you
re
pining
away
just
as
he
did
shall
i
tell
you
why
she
snatched
off
the
shade
from
the
lamp
and
put
her
hand
under
the
table
and
brought
out
an
image
of
wax
image
she
pointed
to
three
pins
in
it
one
she
says
for
no
sleep
one
for
no
appetite
one
for
broken
i
asked
her
what
i
had
done
to
make
such
a
bitter
enemy
of
her
she
says
remember
what
i
asked
of
you
when
we
talked
of
your
being
my
servant
choose
which
you
will
do
die
by
inches
i
swear
she
said
it
as
i
hope
to
be
saved
die
by
inches
or
tell
me
there
in
the
full
frenzy
of
the
agitation
that
possessed
her
there
ellmother
suddenly
stopped
alban
s
first
impression
was
that
she
might
have
fainted
he
looked
closer
and
could
just
see
her
shadowy
figure
still
seated
in
the
chair
he
asked
if
she
was
no
then
why
don
t
you
go
on
i
have
done
she
answered
do
you
think
you
can
put
me
off
he
rejoined
sternly
with
such
an
excuse
as
that
what
did
miss
de
sor
ask
you
to
tell
her
you
promised
to
trust
me
be
as
good
as
your
in
the
days
of
her
health
and
strength
she
would
have
set
him
at
defiance
all
she
could
do
now
was
to
appeal
to
his
mercy
make
some
allowance
for
me
she
said
i
have
been
terribly
upset
what
has
become
of
my
courage
what
has
broken
me
down
in
this
way
spare
me
he
refused
to
listen
this
vile
attempt
to
practice
on
your
fears
may
be
repeated
he
reminded
her
more
cruel
advantage
may
be
taken
of
the
nervous
derangement
from
which
you
are
suffering
in
the
climate
of
this
place
you
little
know
me
if
you
think
i
will
allow
that
to
go
she
made
a
last
effort
to
plead
with
him
oh
sir
is
this
behaving
like
the
good
kind
man
i
thought
you
were
you
say
you
are
miss
emily
s
friend
don
t
press
me
for
miss
emily
s
sake
emily
alban
exclaimed
is
concerned
in
this
there
was
a
change
to
tenderness
in
his
voice
which
persuaded
ellmother
that
she
had
found
her
way
to
the
weak
side
of
him
her
one
effort
now
was
to
strengthen
the
impression
which
she
believed
herself
to
have
produced
miss
emily
concerned
in
it
she
confessed
in
what
way
never
mind
in
what
but
i
do
i
tell
you
sir
miss
emily
must
never
know
it
to
her
dying
day
the
first
suspicion
of
the
truth
crossed
alban
s
mind
i
understand
you
at
last
he
said
what
miss
emily
must
never
know
is
what
miss
de
sor
wanted
you
to
tell
her
oh
it
s
useless
to
contradict
me
her
motive
in
trying
to
frighten
you
is
as
plain
to
me
now
as
if
she
had
confessed
it
are
you
sure
you
didn
t
betray
yourself
when
she
showed
the
image
of
wax
i
should
have
died
first
the
reply
had
hardly
escaped
her
before
she
regretted
it
what
makes
you
want
to
be
so
sure
about
it
she
said
it
looks
as
if
you
knew
i
do
what
the
kindest
thing
that
he
could
do
now
was
to
speak
out
your
secret
is
no
secret
to
he
said
rage
and
fear
shook
her
together
for
the
moment
she
was
like
the
ellmother
of
former
days
you
lie
she
cried
i
speak
the
i
won
t
believe
you
i
daren
t
believe
you
listen
to
me
in
emily
s
interests
listen
to
me
i
have
read
of
the
murder
at
zeeland
that
s
nothing
the
man
was
a
namesake
of
her
the
man
was
her
father
himself
keep
your
seat
there
is
nothing
to
be
alarmed
about
i
know
that
emily
is
ignorant
of
the
horrid
death
that
her
father
died
i
know
that
you
and
your
late
mistress
have
kept
the
discovery
from
her
to
this
day
i
know
the
love
and
pity
which
plead
your
excuse
for
deceiving
her
and
the
circumstances
that
favored
the
deception
my
good
creature
emily
s
peace
of
mind
is
as
sacred
to
me
as
it
is
to
you
i
love
her
as
i
love
my
own
life
and
better
are
you
calmer
now
he
heard
her
crying
it
was
the
best
relief
that
could
come
to
her
after
waiting
a
while
to
let
the
tears
have
their
way
he
helped
her
to
rise
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
now
the
one
thing
to
do
was
to
take
her
back
to
the
house
i
can
give
you
a
word
of
advice
he
said
before
we
part
for
the
night
you
must
leave
miss
de
sor
s
service
at
once
your
health
will
be
a
sufficient
excuse
give
her
warning
ellmother
hung
back
when
he
offered
her
his
arm
the
bare
prospect
of
seeing
francine
again
was
revolting
to
her
on
alban
s
assurance
that
the
notice
to
leave
could
be
given
in
writing
she
made
no
further
resistance
the
village
clock
struck
eleven
as
they
ascended
the
terrace
steps
a
minute
later
another
person
left
the
grounds
by
the
path
which
led
to
the
house
alban
s
precaution
had
been
taken
too
late
the
smell
of
had
guided
francine
when
she
was
at
a
loss
which
way
to
turn
next
in
search
of
ellmother
for
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
she
had
been
listening
hidden
among
the
trees
chapter
xxxvi
change
of
air
the
inmates
of
netherwoods
rose
early
and
went
to
bed
early
when
alban
and
ellmother
arrived
at
the
back
door
of
the
house
they
found
it
locked
the
only
light
visible
along
the
whole
length
of
the
building
glimmered
through
the
venetian
blind
of
the
to
francine
s
alban
proposed
to
get
admission
to
the
house
by
that
way
in
her
horror
of
again
encountering
francine
ellmother
positively
refused
to
follow
him
when
he
turned
away
from
the
door
they
can
t
be
all
asleep
yet
she
said
and
rang
the
bell
one
person
was
still
out
of
bed
and
that
person
was
the
mistress
of
the
house
they
recognized
her
voice
in
the
customary
question
who
s
there
the
door
having
been
opened
good
miss
ladd
looked
backward
and
forward
between
alban
and
ellmother
with
the
bewildered
air
of
a
lady
who
doubted
the
evidence
of
her
own
eyes
the
next
moment
her
sense
of
humor
overpowered
her
she
burst
out
laughing
close
the
door
morris
she
said
and
be
so
good
as
to
tell
me
what
this
means
have
you
been
giving
a
lesson
in
drawing
by
starlight
ellmother
moved
so
that
the
light
of
the
lamp
in
miss
ladd
s
hand
fell
on
her
face
i
am
faint
and
giddy
she
said
let
me
go
to
my
miss
ladd
instantly
followed
her
pray
forgive
me
i
didn
t
see
you
were
ill
when
i
spoke
she
gently
explained
what
can
i
do
for
you
thank
you
kindly
ma
am
i
want
nothing
but
peace
and
quiet
i
wish
you
alban
followed
miss
ladd
to
her
study
on
the
front
side
of
the
house
he
had
just
mentioned
the
circumstances
under
which
he
and
ellmother
had
met
when
they
were
interrupted
by
a
tap
at
the
door
francine
had
got
back
to
her
room
unperceived
by
way
of
the
french
window
she
now
presented
herself
with
an
elaborate
apology
and
with
the
nearest
approach
to
a
penitent
expression
of
which
her
face
was
capable
i
am
ashamed
miss
ladd
to
intrude
on
you
at
this
time
of
night
my
only
excuse
is
that
i
am
anxious
about
ellmother
i
heard
you
just
now
in
the
hall
if
she
is
really
ill
i
am
the
unfortunate
cause
of
in
what
way
miss
de
sor
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
frightened
her
while
we
were
talking
in
my
room
quite
unintentionally
she
rushed
to
the
door
and
ran
out
i
supposed
she
had
gone
to
her
bedroom
i
had
no
idea
she
was
in
the
in
this
false
statement
there
was
mingled
a
grain
of
truth
it
was
true
that
francine
believed
ellmother
to
have
taken
refuge
in
her
room
for
she
had
examined
the
room
finding
it
empty
and
failing
to
discover
the
fugitive
in
other
parts
of
the
house
she
had
become
alarmed
and
had
tried
the
grounds
next
with
the
formidable
result
which
has
been
already
related
concealing
this
circumstance
she
had
lied
in
such
a
skillfully
artless
manner
that
alban
having
no
suspicion
of
what
had
really
happened
to
sharpen
his
wits
was
as
completely
deceived
as
miss
ladd
proceeding
to
further
explanation
and
remembering
that
she
was
in
alban
s
presence
francine
was
careful
to
keep
herself
within
the
strict
limit
of
truth
confessing
that
she
had
frightened
her
servant
by
a
description
of
sorcery
as
it
was
practiced
among
the
slaves
on
her
father
s
estate
she
only
lied
again
in
declaring
that
ellmother
had
supposed
she
was
in
earnest
when
she
was
guilty
of
no
more
serious
offense
than
playing
a
practical
joke
in
this
case
alban
was
necessarily
in
a
position
to
detect
the
falsehood
but
it
was
so
evidently
in
francine
s
interests
to
present
her
conduct
in
the
most
favorable
light
that
the
discovery
failed
to
excite
his
suspicion
he
waited
in
silence
while
miss
ladd
administered
a
severe
reproof
francine
having
left
the
room
as
penitently
as
she
had
entered
it
with
her
handkerchief
over
her
tearless
eyes
he
was
at
liberty
with
certain
reserves
to
return
to
what
had
passed
between
ellmother
and
himself
the
fright
which
the
poor
old
woman
has
suffered
he
said
has
led
to
one
good
result
i
have
found
her
ready
at
last
to
acknowledge
that
she
is
ill
and
inclined
to
believe
that
the
change
to
netherwoods
has
had
something
to
do
with
it
i
have
advised
her
to
take
the
course
which
you
suggested
by
leaving
this
house
is
it
possible
to
dispense
with
the
usual
delay
when
she
gives
notice
to
leave
miss
de
sor
s
service
she
need
feel
no
anxiety
poor
soul
on
that
account
miss
ladd
replied
in
any
case
i
had
arranged
that
a
week
s
notice
on
either
side
should
be
enough
as
it
is
i
will
speak
to
francine
myself
the
least
she
can
do
to
express
her
regret
is
to
place
no
difficulties
in
ellmother
s
the
next
day
was
sunday
miss
ladd
broke
through
her
rule
of
attending
to
secular
affairs
on
week
days
only
and
after
consulting
with
ellmother
arranged
with
francine
that
her
servant
should
be
at
liberty
to
leave
netherwoods
health
permitting
on
the
next
day
but
one
difficulty
remained
ellmother
was
in
no
condition
to
take
the
long
journey
to
her
birthplace
in
cumberland
and
her
own
lodgings
in
london
had
been
let
under
these
circumstances
what
was
the
best
arrangement
that
could
be
made
for
her
miss
ladd
wisely
and
kindly
wrote
to
emily
on
the
subject
and
asked
for
a
speedy
reply
later
in
the
day
alban
was
sent
for
to
see
ellmother
he
found
her
anxiously
waiting
to
hear
what
had
passed
on
the
previous
night
between
miss
ladd
and
himself
were
you
careful
sir
to
say
nothing
about
miss
emily
i
was
especially
careful
i
never
alluded
to
her
in
any
has
miss
de
sor
spoken
to
you
i
have
not
given
her
the
she
s
an
obstinate
one
she
might
if
she
does
she
shall
hear
my
opinion
of
her
in
plain
the
talk
between
them
turned
next
on
alban
s
discovery
of
the
secret
of
which
ellmother
had
believed
herself
to
be
the
sole
depositary
since
miss
letitia
s
death
without
alarming
her
by
any
needless
allusion
to
doctor
allday
or
to
miss
jethro
he
answered
her
inquiries
so
far
as
he
was
himself
concerned
without
reserve
her
curiosity
once
satisfied
she
showed
no
disposition
to
pursue
the
topic
she
pointed
to
miss
ladd
s
cat
fast
asleep
by
the
side
of
an
empty
saucer
is
it
a
sin
morris
to
wish
i
was
tom
doesn
t
trouble
himself
about
his
life
that
is
past
or
his
life
that
is
to
come
if
i
could
only
empty
my
saucer
and
go

shouldn

be

of
the
number
of
people
in
this

would
be
better
out
of
it
than

letter
to
excellent
purpose
by
telegraph

message
announced

care
of
the
cottage

my
absence
i
shall
be
away
for
a
month
at
least
all
is
prepared
for
her
if
she
ellmother
gladly
accepted
this
proposal
in
the
interval
of
emily
s
absence
she
could
easily
arrange
to
return
to
her
own
lodgings
with
words
of
sincere
gratitude
she
took
leave
of
miss
ladd
but
no
persuasion
would
induce
her
to
say
to
francine
do
me
one
more
kindness
ma
am
don
t
tell
miss
de
sor
when
i
go
ignorant
of
the
provocation
which
had
produced
this
unforgiving
temper
of
mind
miss
ladd
gently
remonstrated
miss
de
sor
received
my
reproof
in
a
penitent
spirit
she
expresses
sincere
sorrow
for
having
thoughtlessly
frightened
you
both
yesterday
and
she
has
made
kind
inquiries
after
your
health
come
come
don
t
bear
malice
wish
her
ellmother
s
answer
was
characteristic
i
ll
say
by
telegraph
when
i
get
to
her
last
words
were
addressed
to
alban
if
you
can
find
a
way
of
doing
it
sir
keep
those
two
do
you
mean
emily
and
miss
de
sor
what
are
you
afraid
of
i
don
t
is
that
quite
reasonable
ellmother
i
daresay
not
i
only
know
that
i
the
pony
chaise
took
her
away
alban
s
class
was
not
yet
ready
for
him
he
waited
on
the
terrace
innocent
alike
of
all
knowledge
of
the
serious
reason
for
fear
which
did
really
exist
ellmother
and
alban
felt
nevertheless
the
same
vague
distrust
of
an
intimacy
between
the
two
girls
idle
vain
malicious
false
to
know
that
francine
s
character
presented
these
faults
without
any
discoverable
merits
to
set
against
them
was
surely
enough
to
justify
a
gloomy
view
of
the
prospect
if
she
succeeded
in
winning
the
position
of
emily
s
friend
alban
reasoned
it
out
logically
in
this
way
without
satisfying
himself
and
without
accounting
for
the
remembrance
that
haunted
him
of
ellmother
s
farewell
look
a
commonplace
man
would
say
we
are
both
in
a
morbid
state
of
mind
he
thought
and
sometimes
commonplace
men
turn
out
to
be
he
was
too
deeply
preoccupied
to
notice
that
he
had
advanced
perilously
near
francine
s
window
she
suddenly
stepped
out
of
her
room
and
spoke
to
him
do
you
happen
to
know
morris
why
ellmother
has
gone
away
without
bidding
me
she
was
probably
afraid
miss
de
sor
that
you
might
make
her
the
victim
of
another
francine
eyed
him
steadily
have
you
any
particular
reason
for
speaking
to
me
in
that
way
i
am
not
aware
that
i
have
answered
you
rudely
if
that
is
what
you
that
is
what
i
mean
you
seem
to
have
taken
a
dislike
to
me
i
should
be
glad
to
know
i
dislike
cruelty
and
you
have
behaved
cruelly
to
meaning
to
be
cruel
francine
inquired
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
miss
de
sor
that
i
can
t
answer
that
francine
looked
at
him
again
am
i
to
understand
that
we
are
enemies
she
asked
you
are
to
understand
he
replied
that
a
person
whom
miss
ladd
employs
to
help
her
in
teaching
can
not
always
presume
to
express
his
sentiments
in
speaking
to
the
young
if
that
means
anything
morris
it
means
that
we
are
it
means
miss
de
sor
that
i
am
the
at
this
school
and
that
i
am
called
to
my
francine
returned
to
her
room
relieved
of
the
only
doubt
that
had
troubled
her
plainly
no
suspicion
that
she
had
overheard
what
passed
between
ellmother
and
himself
existed
in
alban
s
mind
as
to
the
use
to
be
made
of
her
discovery
she
felt
no
difficulty
in
deciding
to
wait
and
be
guided
by
events
her
curiosity
and
her
had
been
alike
gratified
she
had
got
the
better
of
ellmother
at
last
and
with
that
triumph
she
was
content
while
emily
remained
her
friend
it
would
be
an
act
of
useless
cruelty
to
disclose
the
terrible
truth
there
had
certainly
been
a
coolness
between
them
at
brighton
but
francine
still
influenced
by
the
magnetic
attraction
which
drew
her
to
emily
did
not
conceal
from
herself
that
she
had
offered
the
provocation
and
had
been
therefore
the
person
to
blame
i
can
set
all
that
right
she
thought
when
we
meet
at
monksmoor
she
opened
her
desk
and
wrote
the
shortest
and
sweetest
of
letters
to
cecilia
i
am
entirely
at
the
disposal
of
my
charming
friend
on
any
convenient
day
may
i
add
my
dear
the
sooner
the
better
chapter
xxxvii
the
lady
wants
you
the
pupils
of
the
put
away
their
pencils
and
in
high
good
humor
the
teacher
s
vigilant
eye
for
faults
had
failed
him
for
the
first
time
in
their
experience
not
one
of
them
had
been
reproved
they
had
chattered
and
giggled
and
drawn
caricatures
on
the
margin
of
the
paper
as
freely
as
if
the
master
had
left
the
room
alban
s
wandering
attention
was
indeed
beyond
the
reach
of
control
his
interview
with
francine
had
doubled
his
sense
of
responsibility
toward
emily
while
he
was
further
than
ever
from
seeing
how
he
could
interfere
to
any
useful
purpose
in
his
present
position
and
with
his
reasons
for
writing
under
reserve
one
of
the
servants
addressed
him
as
he
was
leaving
the
schoolroom
the
landlady
s
boy
was
waiting
in
the
hall
with
a
message
from
his
lodgings
now
then
what
is
it
he
asked
irritably
the
lady
wants
you
with
this
mysterious
answer
the
boy
presented
a
visiting
card
the
name
inscribed
on
it
was
miss
she
had
arrived
by
the
train
and
she
was
then
waiting
at
alban
s
lodgings
say
i
will
be
with
her
having
given
the
message
he
stood
for
a
while
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
literally
lost
in
astonishment
it
was
simply
impossible
to
guess
at
miss
jethro
s
object
and
yet
with
the
usual
perversity
of
human
nature
he
was
still
wondering
what
she
could
possibly
want
with
him
up
to
the
final
moment
when
he
opened
the
door
of
his
she
rose
and
bowed
with
the
same
grace
of
movement
and
the
same
composure
of
manner
which
doctor
allday
had
noticed
when
she
entered
his
her
dark
melancholy
eyes
rested
on
alban
with
a
look
of
gentle
interest
a
faint
flush
of
color
animated
for
a
moment
the
faded
beauty
of
her
face
passed
away
again
and
left
it
paler
than
before
i
can
not
conceal
from
myself
she
began
that
i
am
intruding
on
you
under
embarrassing
may
i
ask
miss
jethro
to
what
circumstances
you
allude
you
forget
morris
that
i
left
miss
ladd
s
school
in
a
manner
which
justified
doubt
of
me
in
the
minds
of
speaking
as
one
of
those
strangers
alban
replied
i
can
not
feel
that
i
had
any
right
to
form
an
opinion
on
a
matter
which
only
concerned
miss
ladd
and
miss
jethro
bowed
gravely
you
encourage
me
to
hope
she
said
i
think
you
will
place
a
favorable
construction
on
my
visit
when
i
mention
my
motive
i
ask
you
to
receive
me
in
the
interests
of
miss
emily
stating
her
purpose
in
calling
on
him
in
those
plain
terms
she
added
to
the
amazement
which
alban
already
felt
by
handing
to
him
as
if
she
was
presenting
an
introduction
a
letter
marked
private
addressed
to
her
by
doctor
allday
i
may
tell
you
she
premised
that
i
had
no
idea
of
troubling
you
until
doctor
allday
suggested
it
i
wrote
to
him
in
the
first
instance
and
there
is
his
reply
pray
read
the
letter
was
dated
penzance
and
the
doctor
wrote
as
he
spoke
without
ceremony
madam
your
letter
has
been
forwarded
to
me
i
am
spending
my
autumn
holiday
in
the
far
west
of
cornwall
however
if
i
had
been
at
home
it
would
have
made
no
difference
i
should
have
begged
leave
to
decline
holding
any
further
conversation
with
you
on
the
subject
of
miss
emily
brown
for
the
following
reasons
in
the
first
place
though
i
can
not
doubt
your
sincere
interest
in
the
young
lady
s
welfare
i
don
t
like
your
mysterious
way
of
showing
it
in
the
second
place
when
i
called
at
your
address
in
london
after
you
had
left
my
house
i
found
that
you
had
taken
to
flight
i
place
my
own
interpretation
on
this
circumstance
but
as
it
is
not
founded
on
any
knowledge
of
facts
i
merely
allude
to
it
and
say
no
arrived
at
that
point
alban
offered
to
return
the
letter
do
you
really
mean
me
to
go
on
reading
it
he
asked
yes
she
said
quietly
alban
returned
to
the
letter
in
the
third
place
i
have
good
reason
to
believe
that
you
entered
miss
ladd
s
school
as
a
teacher
under
false
pretenses
after
that
discovery
i
tell
you
plainly
i
hesitate
to
attach
credit
to
any
statement
that
you
may
wish
to
make
at
the
same
time
i
must
not
permit
my
prejudices
as
you
will
probably
call
them
to
stand
in
the
way
of
miss
emily
s
interests
supposing
them
to
be
really
depending
on
any
interference
of
yours
miss
ladd
s
alban
morris
is
even
more
devoted
to
miss
emily
s
service
than
i
am
whatever
you
might
have
said
to
me
you
can
say
to
him
with
this
possible
advantage
that
may
believe
there
the
letter
ended
alban
handed
it
back
in
silence
miss
jethro
pointed
to
the
words
mr
alban
morris
is
even
more
devoted
to
miss
emily
s
service
than
i
is
that
true
she
asked
quite
i
don
t
complain
morris
of
the
hard
things
said
of
me
in
that
letter
you
are
at
liberty
to
suppose
if
you
like
that
i
deserve
them
attribute
it
to
pride
or
attribute
it
to
reluctance
to
make
needless
demands
on
your
time
i
shall
not
attempt
to
defend
myself
i
leave
you
to
decide
whether
the
woman
who
has
shown
you
that
letter
having
something
important
to
say
to
you
is
a
person
who
is
mean
enough
to
say
it
under
false
tell
me
what
i
can
do
for
you
miss
jethro
and
be
assured
beforehand
that
i
don
t
doubt
your
my
purpose
in
coming
here
she
answered
is
to
induce
you
to
use
your
influence
over
miss
emily
brown
with
what
object
alban
asked
interrupting
her
my
object
is
her
own
good
some
years
since
i
happened
to
become
acquainted
with
a
person
who
has
attained
some
celebrity
as
a
preacher
you
have
perhaps
heard
of
mr
miles
mirabel
i
have
heard
of
i
have
been
in
correspondence
with
him
miss
jethro
proceeded
he
tells
me
he
has
been
introduced
to
a
young
lady
who
was
formerly
one
of
miss
ladd
s
pupils
and
who
is
the
daughter
of
wyvil
of
monksmoor
park
he
has
called
on
wyvil
and
he
has
since
received
an
invitation
to
stay
at
wyvil
s
house
the
day
fixed
for
the
visit
is
monday
the
fifth
of
next
alban
listened
at
a
loss
to
know
what
interest
he
was
supposed
to
have
in
being
made
acquainted
with
mirabel
s
engagements
miss
jethro
s
next
words
enlightened
him
you
are
perhaps
aware
she
resumed
that
miss
emily
brown
is
miss
wyvil
s
intimate
friend
she
will
be
one
of
the
guests
at
monksmoor
park
if
there
are
any
obstacles
which
you
can
place
in
her
way
if
there
is
any
influence
which
you
can
exert
without
exciting
suspicion
of
your
motive
prevent
her
i
entreat
you
from
accepting
miss
wyvil
s
invitation
until
mirabel
s
visit
has
come
to
an
is
there
anything
against
mirabel
he
asked
i
say
nothing
against
is
miss
emily
acquainted
with
him
is
he
a
person
with
whom
it
would
be
disagreeable
to
her
to
associate
quite
the
and
yet
you
expect
me
to
prevent
them
from
meeting
be
reasonable
miss
i
can
only
be
in
earnest
morris
more
truly
more
deeply
in
earnest
than
you
can
suppose
i
declare
to
you
that
i
am
speaking
in
miss
emily
s
interests
do
you
still
refuse
to
exert
yourself
for
her
sake
i
am
spared
the
pain
of
refusal
alban
answered
the
time
for
interference
has
gone
by

at
this
moment
on
her
way
to

to
rise
and
dropped
back

chair

said
faintly

drinking
from
the
glass

the
last
drop

to
revive

little
was
on
the
floor
at
her
side
she
took
out
a
railway
guide
and
tried
to
consult
it
her
fingers
trembled
incessantly
she
was
unable
to
find
the
page
to
which
she
wished
to
refer
help
me
she
said
i
must
leave
this
place
by
the
first
train
that
to
see
emily

asked
quite
useless
you
have
said
it
yourself
the
time
for
interference

gone
by
look
at
the
what
place
shall
i
look
for
look
for

alban
found
the
place
the
train
was
due
in
ten
minutes
surely
you
are
not
fit
to
travel
so
soon
he
suggested
fit
or
not
i
must
see
mirabel
i
must
make
the
effort
to
keep
them
apart
by
appealing
to
with
any
hope
of
success
with
no
hope
and
with
no
interest
in
the
man
himself
still
i
must
out
of
anxiety
for
emily
s
welfare
out
of
anxiety
for
more
than
for
what
if
you
can
t
guess
i
daren
t
tell
that
strange
reply
startled
alban
before
he
could
ask
what
it
meant
miss
jethro
had
left
him
in
the
emergencies
of
life
a
person
readier
of
resource

alban

it
would
not
have
been
easy
to
discover
the
extraordinary
interview
that
had
now
come
to
an
end
had
found
its
limits
bewildered
and
helpless
he
stood
at

be
without
a
partner
there
are
three
invaluable
young
gentlemen
present
who
are
excellent
dancers
members
of
different
families
they
are
nevertheless
fearfully
and
wonderfully
like
each
other
they
present
the
same
rosy
complexions
and
mustachios
the
same
plump
cheeks
vacant
eyes
and
low
forehead
and
they
utter
with
the
same
stolid
gravity
the
same
imbecile
small
talk
on
sofas
facing
each
other
sit
the
two
remaining
guests
who
have
not
joined
the
elders
at
the
in
another
room
they
are
both
men
one
of
them
is
drowsy
and
happy
in
the
possession
of
large
landed
property
happier
still
in
a
capacity
for
drinking
wyvil
s
famous
without
gouty
results
the
other
gentleman
ah
who
is
the
other
he
is
the
confidential
adviser
and
bosom
friend
of
every
young
lady
in
the
house
is
it
necessary
to
name
the
reverend
miles
mirabel
there
he
sits
enthroned
with
room
for
a
fair
admirer
on
either
side
of
him
the
clerical
sultan
of
a
platonic
harem
his
persuasive
ministry
is
felt
as
well
as
heard
he
has
an
innocent
habit
of
fondling
young
persons
one
of
his
arms
is
even
long
enough
to
embrace
the
circumference
of
miss
plym
while
the
other
clasps
the
rigid
silken
waist
of
francine
i
do
it
everywhere
else
he
says
innocently
why
not
here
why
not
indeed
with
that
delicate
complexion
and
those
beautiful
blue
eyes
with
the
glorious
golden
hair
that
rests
on
his
shoulders
and
the
glossy
beard
that
flows
over
his
breast
familiarities
forbidden
to
mere
men
become
privileges
and
condescensions
when
an
angel
enters
society
and
more
especially
when
that
angel
has
enough
of
mortality
in
him
to
be
amusing
mirabel
on
his
social
side
is
an
irresistible
companion
he
is
cheerfulness
itself
he
takes
a
favorable
view
of
everything
his
sweet
temper
never
differs
with
anybody
in
my
humble
way
he
confesses
i
like
to
make
the
world
about
me
laughter
harmlessly
produced
observe
is
the
element
in
which
he
lives
and
breathes
miss
darnaway
s
serious
face
puts
him
out
he
has
laid
a
bet
with
emily
not
in
money
not
even
in
gloves
only
in
flowers
that
he
will
make
miss
darnaway
laugh
and
he
has
won
the
wager
emily
s
flowers
are
in
his
peeping
through
the
curly
interstices
of
his
beard
must
you
leave
me
he
asks
tenderly
when
there
is
a
dancing
man
at
liberty
and
it
is
francine
s
turn
to
claim
him
she
leaves
her
seat
not
very
willingly
for
a
while
the
place
is
vacant
miss
plym
seizes
the
opportunity
of
consulting
the
ladies
bosom
friend
dear
mirabel
do
tell
me
what
you
think
of
miss
de
sor
dear
mirabel
bursts
into
enthusiasm
and
makes
a
charming
reply
his
large
experience
of
young
ladies
warns
him
that
they
will
tell
each
other
what
he
thinks
of
them
when
they
retire
for
the
night
and
he
is
careful
on
these
occasions
to
say
something
that
will
bear
repetition
i
see
in
miss
de
sor
he
declares
the
resolution
of
a
man
tempered
by
the
sweetness
of
a
woman
when
that
interesting
creature
marries
her
husband
will
be
shall
i
use
the
vulgar
word
henpecked
dear
miss
plym
he
will
enjoy
it
and
he
will
be
quite
right
too
and
if
i
am
asked
to
the
wedding
i
shall
say
with
heartfelt
sincerity
enviable
man
in
the
height
of
her
admiration
for
mirabel
s
wonderful
eye
for
character
miss
plym
is
called
away
to
the
piano
cecilia
succeeds
to
her
friend
s
place
and
has
her
waist
taken
in
charge
as
a
matter
of
course
how
do
you
like
miss
plym
she
asks
directly
mirabel
smiles
and
shows
the
prettiest
little
pearly
teeth
i
was
just
thinking
of
her
he
confesses
pleasantly
miss
plym
is
so
nice
and
plump
so
comforting
and
domestic
such
a
perfect
clergyman
s
daughter
you
love
her
don
t
you
is
she
engaged
to
be
married
in
that
case
between
ourselves
dear
miss
wyvil
a
clergyman
is
obliged
to
be
cautious
i
may
own
that
i
love
her
delicious
titillations
of
flattered
betray
themselves
in
cecilia
s
lovely
complexion
she
is
the
chosen
confidante
of
this
irresistible
man
and
she
would
like
to
express
her
sense
of
obligation
but
mirabel
is
a
master
in
the
art
of
putting
the
right
words
in
the
right
places
and
simple
cecilia
distrusts
herself
and
her
grammar
at
that
moment
of
embarrassment
a
friend
leaves
the
dance
and
helps
cecilia
out
of
the
difficulty
emily
approaches
the
breathless
followed
by
her
partner
entreating
her
to
give
him
one
turn
she
is
not
to
be
tempted
she
means
to
rest
cecilia
sees
an
act
of
mercy
suggested
by
the
presence
of
the
disengaged
young
man
she
seizes
his
arm
and
hurries
him
off
to
poor
miss
darnaway
sitting
forlorn
in
a
corner
and
thinking
of
the
nursery
at
home
in
the
meanwhile
a
circumstance
occurs
mirabel
s
arm
shows
itself
in
a
new
character
when
emily
sits
by
his
side
it
becomes
for
the
first
time
an
irresolute
arm
it
advances
a
little
and
hesitates
emily
at
once
administers
an
unexpected
check
she
insists
on
preserving
a
free
waist
in
her
own
outspoken
language
no
mirabel
keep
that
for
the
others
you
can
t
imagine
how
ridiculous
you
and
the
young
ladies
look
and
how
absurdly
unaware
of
it
you
all
seem
to
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
the
reverend
and
man
of
the
world
is
at
a
loss
for
an
answer
why
for
this
simple
reason
he
too
has
felt
the
magnetic
attraction
of
the
irresistible
little
creature
whom
every
one
likes
miss
jethro
has
been
doubly
defeated
she
has
failed
to
keep
them
apart
and
her
unexplained
misgivings
have
not
been
justified
by
events
emily
and
mirabel
are
good
friends
already
the
brilliant
clergyman
is
poor
his
interests
in
life
point
to
a
marriage
for
money
he
has
fascinated
the
heiresses
of
two
rich
fathers
tyvil
and
de
sor
and
yet
he
is
conscious
of
an
influence
an
alien
influence
without
a
balance
at
its
bankers
which
has
in
some
mysterious
way
got
between
him
and
his
interests
on
emily
s
side
the
attraction
felt
is
of
another
nature
altogether
among
the
merry
young
people
at
monksmoor
she
is
her
old
happy
self
again
and
she
finds
in
mirabel
the
most
agreeable
and
amusing
man
whom
she
has
ever
met
after
those
dismal
night
watches
by
the
bed
of
her
dying
aunt
and
the
dreary
weeks
of
solitude
that
followed
to
live
in
this
new
world
of
luxury
and
gayety
is
like
escaping
from
the
darkness
of
night
and
basking
in
the
fall
brightn
ess
of
day
cecilia
declares
that
she
looks
once
more
like
the
joyous
queen
of
the
bedroom
in
the
bygone
time
at
school
and
francine
profaning
shakespeare
without
knowing
it
says
emily
is
herself
again
now
that
your
arm
is
in
its
right
place
reverend
sir
she
gayly
resumes
i
may
admit
that
there
are
exceptions
to
all
rules
my
waist
is
at
your
disposal
in
a
case
of
necessity
that
is
to
say
in
a
case
of
the
one
case
of
all
others
mirabel
answers
with
the
engaging
frankness
that
has
won
him
so
many
friends
which
can
never
happen
in
my
unhappy
experience
waltzing
i
blush
to
own
it
means
picking
me
up
off
the
floor
and
putting
smelling
salts
to
my
nostrils
in
other
words
dear
miss
emily
it
is
the
room
that
waltzes
not
i
can
t
look
at
those
whirling
couples
there
with
a
steady
head
even
the
exquisite
figure
of
our
young
hostess
when
it
describes
flying
circles
turns
me
hearing
this
allusion
to
cecilia
emily
drops
to
the
level
of
the
other
girls
she
too
pays
her
homage
to
the
pope
of
private
life
you
promised
me
your
unbiased
opinion
of
cecilia
she
reminds
him
and
you
haven
t
given
it
the
ladies
friend
gently
remonstrates
miss
wyvil
s
beauty
dazzles
me
how
can
i
give
an
unbiased
opinion
besides
i
am
not
thinking
of
her
i
can
only
think
of
emily
lifts
her
eyes
half
merrily
half
tenderly
and
looks
at
him
over
the
top
of
her
fan
it
is
her
first
effort
at
flirtation
she
is
tempted
to
engage
in
the
most
interesting
of
all
games
to
a
girl
the
game
which
plays
at
making
love
what
has
cecilia
told
her
in
those
bedroom
gossipings
dear
to
the
hearts
of
the
two
friends
cecilia
has
whispered
mr
mirabel
admires
your
figure
he
calls
you
the
venus
of
milo
in
a
state
of
perfect
where
is
the
daughter
of
eve
who
would
not
have
been
flattered
by
that
pretty
compliment
who
would
not
have
talked
soft
nonsense
in
return
you
can
only
think
of
me
emily
repeats
coquettishly
have
you
said
that
to
the
last
young
lady
who
occupied
my
place
and
will
you
say
it
again
to
the
next
who
follows
me
not
to
one
of
them
mere
compliments
are
for
the
others
not
for
what
is
for
me
mirabel
what
i
have
just
offered
you
a
confession
of
the
emily
is
startled
by
the
tone
in
which
he
replies
he
seems
to
be
in
earnest
not
a
vestige
is
left
of
the
easy
gayety
of
his
manner
his
face
shows
an
expression
of
anxiety
which
she
has
never
seen
in
it
yet
do
you
believe
me
he
asks
in
a
whisper
she
tries
to
change
the
subject
when
am
i
to
hear
you
preach
mirabel
he
persists
when
you
believe
me
he
says
his
eyes
add
an
emphasis
to
that
reply
which
is
not
to
be
mistaken
emily
turns
away
from
him
and
notices
francine
she
has
left
the
dance
and
is
looking
with
marked
attention
at
emily
and
mirabel
i
want
to
speak
to
you
she
says
and
beckons
impatiently
to
emily
mirabel
whispers
don
t
go
emily
rises
nevertheless
ready
to
avail
herself
of
the
first
excuse
for
leaving
him
francine
meets
her
half
way
and
takes
her
roughly
by
the
arm
what
is
it
emily
asks
suppose
you
leave
off
flirting
with
mirabel
and
make
yourself
of
some
in
what
way
use
your
ears
and
look
at
that
she
points
disdainfully
to
innocent
miss
plym
the
rector
s
daughter
possesses
all
the
virtues
with
one
exception
the
virtue
of
having
an
ear
for
music
when
she
sings
she
is
out
of
tune
and
when
she
plays
she
murders
time
who
can
dance
to
such
music
as
that
says
francine
finish
the
waltz
for
emily
naturally
hesitates
how
can
i
take
her
place
unless
she
asks
me
francine
laughs
scornfully
say
at
once
you
want
to
go
back
to
do
you
think
i
should
have
got
up
when
you
beckoned
to
me
emily
rejoins
if
i
had
not
wanted
to
get
away
from
mirabel
instead
of
resenting
this
sharp
retort
francine
suddenly
breaks
into
good
humor
come
along
you
little
i
ll
manage
it
for
she
leads
emily
to
the
piano
and
stops
miss
plym
without
a
word
of
apology
it
s
your
turn
to
dance
now
here
s
miss
brown
waiting
to
relieve
cecilia
has
not
been
unobservant
in
her
own
quiet
way
of
what
has
been
going
on
waiting
until
francine
and
miss
plym
are
out
of
hearing
she
bends
over
emily
and
says
my
dear
i
really
do
think
francine
is
in
love
with
after
having
only
been
a
week
in
the
same
house
with
him
emily
exclaims
at
any
rate
said
cecilia
more
smartly
than
usual
she
is
jealous
of
chapter
xxxix
feigning
the
next
morning
mirabel
took
two
members
of
the
circle
at
monksmoor
by
surprise
one
of
them
was
emily
and
one
of
them
was
the
master
of
the
house
seeing
emily
alone
in
the
garden
before
breakfast
he
left
his
room
and
joined
her
let
me
say
one
word
he
pleaded
before
we
go
to
breakfast
i
am
grieved
to
think
that
i
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
offend
you
last
emily
s
look
of
astonishment
answered
for
her
before
she
could
speak
what
can
i
have
said
or
done
she
asked
to
make
you
think
that
now
i
breathe
again
he
cried
with
the
boyish
gayety
of
manner
which
was
one
of
the
secrets
of
his
popularity
among
women
i
really
feared
that
i
had
spoken
thoughtlessly
it
is
a
terrible
confession
for
a
clergyman
to
make
but
it
is
not
the
less
true
that
i
am
one
of
the
most
indiscreet
men
living
it
is
my
rock
ahead
in
life
that
i
say
the
first
thing
which
comes
uppermost
without
stopping
to
think
being
well
aware
of
my
own
defects
i
naturally
distrust
even
in
the
pulpit
emily
inquired
he
laughed
with
the
readiest
appreciation
of
the
satire
although
it
was
directed
against
himself
i
like
that
question
he
said
it
tells
me
we
are
as
good
friends
again
as
ever
the
fact
is
the
sight
of
the
congregation
when
i
get
into
the
pulpit
has
the
same
effect
upon
me
that
the
sight
of
the
footlights
has
on
an
actor
all
oratory
though
my
clerical
brethren
are
shy
of
confessing
it
is
acting
without
the
scenery
and
the
costumes
did
you
really
mean
it
last
night
when
you
said
you
would
like
to
hear
me
preach
indeed
i
how
very
kind
of
you
i
don
t
think
myself
the
sermon
is
worth
the
sacrifice
there
is
another
specimen
of
my
indiscreet
way
of
talking
what
i
mean
is
that
you
will
have
to
get
up
early
on
sunday
morning
and
drive
twelve
miles
to
the
damp
and
dismal
little
village
in
which
i
officiate
for
a
man
with
a
rich
wife
who
likes
the
climate
of
italy
my
congregation
works
in
the
fields
all
the
week
and
naturally
enough
goes
to
sleep
in
church
on
sunday
i
have
had
to
counteract
that
not
by
preaching
i
wouldn
t
puzzle
the
poor
people
with
my
eloquence
for
the
world
no
no
i
tell
them
little
stories
out
of
the
bible
in
a
nice
easy
gossiping
way
a
quarter
of
an
hour
is
my
limit
of
time
and
i
am
proud
to
say
some
of
them
mostly
the
women
do
to
a
certain
extent
keep
awake
if
you
and
the
other
ladies
decide
to
honor
me
it
is
needless
to
say
you
shall
have
one
of
my
grand
efforts
what
will
be
the
effect
on
my
unfortunate
flock
remains
to
be
seen
i
will
have
the
church
brushed
up
and
luncheon
of
course
at
the
parsonage
beans
bacon
and
beer
i
haven
t
got
anything
else
in
the
house
are
you
rich
i
hope
not
i
suspect
i
am
quite
as
poor
as
you
are
i
am
delighted
to
hear
it
more
of
my
indiscretion
our
poverty
is
another
bond
between
before
he
could
enlarge
on
this
text
the
breakfast
bell
rang
he
gave
emily
his
arm
quite
satisfied
with
the
result
of
the
morning
s
talk
in
speaking
seriously
to
her
on
the
previous
night
he
had
committed
the
mistake
of
speaking
too
soon
to
amend
this
false
step
and
to
recover
his
position
in
emily
s
estimation
had
been
his
object
in
view
and
it
had
been
successfully
accomplished
at
the
that
morning
the
companionable
clergyman
was
more
amusing
than
ever
the
meal
being
over
the
company
dispersed
as
usual
with
the
one
exception
of
mirabel
without
any
apparent
reason
he
kept
his
place
at
the
table
wyvil
the
most
courteous
and
considerate
of
men
felt
it
an
attention
due
to
his
guest
not
to
leave
the
room
first
all
that
he
could
venture
to
do
was
to
give
a
little
hint
have
you
any
plans
for
the
morning
he
asked
i
have
a
plan
that
depends
entirely
on
yourself
mirabel
answered
and
i
am
afraid
of
being
as
indiscreet
as
usual
if
i
mention
it
your
charming
daughter
tells
me
you
play
on
the
modest
wyvil
looked
confused
i
hope
you
have
not
been
annoyed
he
said
i
practice
in
a
distant
room
so
that
nobody
may
hear
my
dear
sir
i
am
eager
to
hear
you
music
is
my
passion
and
the
violin
is
my
favorite
wyvil
led
the
way
to
his
room
positively
blushing
with
pleasure
since
the
death
of
his
wife
he
had
been
sadly
in
want
of
a
little
encouragement
his
daughters
and
his
friends
were
careful
as
he
thought
of
intruding
on
him
in
his
hours
of
practice
and
sad
to
say
his
daughters
and
his
friends
were
from
a
musical
point
of
view
perfectly
right
literature
has
hardly
paid
sufficient
attention
to
a
social
phenomenon
of
a
singularly
perplexing
kind
we
hear
enough
and
more
than
enough
of
persons
who
successfully
cultivate
the
arts
of
the
remarkable
manner
in
which
fitness
for
their
vocation
shows
itself
in
early
life
of
the
obstacles
which
family
prejudice
places
in
their
way
and
of
the
unremitting
devotion
which
has
led
to
the
achievement
of
glorious
results
but
how
many
writers
have
noticed
those
other
incomprehensible
persons
members
of
families
innocent
for
generations
past
of
practicing
art
or
caring
for
art
who
have
notwithstanding
displayed
from
their
earliest
years
the
irresistible
desire
to
cultivate
poetry
painting
or
music
who
have
surmounted
obstacles
and
endured
disappointments
in
the
resolution
to
devote
their
lives
to
an
intellectual
pursuit
being
absolutely
without
the
capacity
which
proves
the
vocation
and
justifies
the
sacrifice
here
is
nature
unerring
nature
presented
in
flat
contradiction
with
herself
here
are
men
bent
on
performing
feats
of
running
without
having
legs
and
women
hopelessly
barren
living
in
constant
expectation
of
large
families
to
the
end
of
their
days
the
musician
is
not
to
be
found
more
completely
deprived
than
wyvil
of
natural
capacity
for
playing
on
an
instrument
and
for
twenty
years
past
it
had
been
the
pride
and
delight
of
his
heart
to
let
no
day
of
his
life
go
by
without
practicing
on
the
violin
i
am
sure
i
must
be
tiring
you
he
said
politely
after
having
played
without
mercy
for
an
hour
and
more
no
the
insatiable
amateur
had
his
own
purpose
to
gain
and
was
not
exhausted
yet
wyvil
got
up
to
look
for
some
more
music
in
that
interval
desultory
conversation
naturally
took
place
mirabel
contrived
to
give
it
the
necessary
direction
the
direction
of
emily
the
most
delightful
girl
i
have
met
with
for
many
a
long
year
past
wyvil
declared
warmly
i
don
t
wonder
at
my
daughter
being
so
fond
of
her
she
leads
a
solitary
life
at
home
poor
thing
and
i
am
honestly
glad
to
see
her
spirits
reviving
in
my
an
only
child
mirabel
asked
in
the
necessary
explanation
that
followed
emily
s
isolated
position
in
the
world
was
revealed
in
few
words
but
one
more
discovery
the
most
important
of
all
remained
to
be
made
had
she
used
a
figure
of
speech
in
saying
that
she
was
as
poor
as
mirabel
himself
or
had
she
told
him
the
shocking
truth
he
put
the
question
with
perfect
delicacy
with
unerring
directness
as
well
wyvil
quoting
his
daughter
s
authority
described
emily
s
income
as
falling
short
even
of
two
hundred
a
year
having
made
that
disheartening
reply
he
opened
another
music
book
you
know
this
sonata
of
course
he
said
the
next
moment
the
violin
was
under
his
chin
and
the
performance
began
while
mirabel
was
to
all
appearance
listening
with
the
utmost
attention
he
was
actually
endeavoring
to
reconcile
himself
to
a
serious
sacrifice
of
his
own
inclinations
if
he
remained
much
longer
in
the
same
house
with
emily
the
impression
that
she
had
produced
on
him
would
be
certainly
strengthened
and
he
would
be
guilty
of
the
folly
of
making
an
offer
of
marriage
to
a
woman
who
was
as
poor
as
himself
the
one
remedy
that
could
be
trusted
to
preserve
him
from
such
infatuation
as
this
was
absence
at
the
end
of
the
week
he
had
arranged
to
return
to
vale
regis
for
his
sunday
duty
engaging
to
join
his
friends
again
at
monksmoor
on
the
monday
following
that
rash
promise
there
could
be
no
further
doubt
about
it
must
not
be
fulfilled
he
had
arrived
at
this
resolution
when
the
terrible
activity
of
wyvil
s
bow
was
suspended
by
the
appearance
of
a
third
person
in
the
room
cecilia
s
maid
was
charged
with
a
neat
little
note
from
her
young
lady
to
be
presented
to
her
master
wondering
why
his
daughter
should
write
to
him
wyvil
opened
the
note
and
was
informed
of
cecilia
s
motive
in
these
words
dearest
papa
i
hear
mirabel
is
with
you
and
as
this
is
a
secret
i
must
write
emily
has
received
a
very
strange
letter
this
morning
which
puzzles
her
and
alarms
me
when
you
are
quite
at
liberty
we
shall
be
so
much
obliged
if
you
will
tell
us
how
emily
ought
to
answer
wyvil
stopped
mirabel
on
the
point
of
trying
to
escape
from
the
music
a
little
domestic
matter
to
attend
to
he
said
but
we
will
finish
the
sonata
chapter
xl
consulting
out
of
the
music
room
and
away
from
his
violin
the
sound
side
of
wyvil
s
character
was
free
to
assert
itself
in
his
public
and
in
his
private
capacity
he
was
an
eminently
sensible
man
as
a
member
of
parliament
he
set
an
example
which
might
have
been
followed
with
advantage
by
many
of
his
colleagues
in
the
first
place
he
abstained
from
hastening
the
downfall
of
representative
institutions
by
asking
questions
and
making
speeches
in
the
second
place
he
was
able
to
distinguish
between
the
duty
that
he
owed
to
his
party
and
the
duty
that
he
owed
to
his
country
when
the
legislature
acted
politically
that
is
to
say
when
it
dealt
with
foreign
complications
or
electoral
reforms
he
followed
his
leader
when
the
legislature
acted
socially
that
is
to
say
for
the
good
of
the
people
he
followed
his
conscience
on
the
last
occasion
when
the
great
russian
bugbear
provoked
a
division
he
voted
submissively
with
his
conservative
allies
but
when
the
question
of
opening
museums
and
picture
galleries
on
sundays
arrayed
the
two
parties
in
hostile
camps
he
broke
into
open
mutiny
and
went
over
to
the
liberals
he
consented
to
help
in
preventing
an
extension
of
the
franchise
but
he
refused
to
be
concerned
in
obstructing
the
repeal
of
taxes
on
knowledge
i
am
doubtful
in
the
first
case
he
said
but
i
am
sure
in
the
he
was
asked
for
an
explanation
doubtful
of
what
and
sure
of
what
to
the
astonishment
of
his
leader
he
answered
the
benefit
to
the
the
same
sound
sense
appeared
in
the
transactions
of
his
private
life
lazy
and
dishonest
servants
found
that
the
gentlest
of
masters
had
a
side
to
his
character
which
took
them
by
surprise
and
on
certain
occasions
in
the
experience
of
cecilia
and
her
sister
the
most
indulgent
of
fathers
proved
to
be
as
capable
of
saying
no
as
the
sternest
tyrant
who
ever
ruled
a
fireside
called
into
council
by
his
daughter
and
his
guest
wyvil
assisted
them
by
advice
which
was
equally
wise
and
kind
but
which
afterward
proved
under
the
perverse
influence
of
circumstances
to
be
advice
that
he
had
better
not
have
given
the
letter
to
emily
which
cecilia
had
recommended
to
her
father
s
consideration
had
come
from
netherwoods
and
had
been
written
by
alban
morris
he
assured
emily
that
he
had
only
decided
on
writing
to
her
after
some
hesitation
in
the
hope
of
serving
interests
which
he
did
not
himself
understand
but
which
might
prove
to
be
interests
worthy
of
consideration
nevertheless
having
stated
his
motive
in
these
terms
he
proceeded
to
relate
what
had
passed
between
miss
jethro
and
himself
on
the
subject
of
francine
alban
only
ventured
to
add
that
she
had
not
produced
a
favorable
impression
on
him
and
that
he
could
not
think
her
likely
on
further
experience
to
prove
a
desirable
friend
on
the
last
leaf
were
added
some
lines
which
emily
was
at
no
loss
how
to
answer
she
had
folded
back
the
page
so
that
no
eyes
but
her
own
should
see
how
the
poor
finished
his
letter
i
wish
you
all
possible
happiness
my
dear
among
your
new
friends
but
don
t
forget
the
old
friend
who
thinks
of
you
and
dreams
of
you
and
longs
to
see
you
again
the
little
world
i
live
in
is
a
dreary
world
emily
in
your
absence
will
you
write
to
me
now
and
then
and
encourage
me
to
hope
wyvil
smiled
as
he
looked
at
the
folded
page
which
hid
the
signature
i
suppose
i
may
take
it
for
granted
he
said
slyly
that
this
gentleman
really
has
your
interests
at
heart
may
i
know
who
he
is
emily
answered
the
last
question
readily
enough
wyvil
went
on
with
his
inquiries
about
the
mysterious
lady
with
the
strange
name
he
proceeded
do
you
know
anything
of
her
emily
related
what
she
knew
without
revealing
the
true
reason
for
miss
jethro
s
departure
from
netherwoods
in
after
years
it
was
one
of
her
most
treasured
remembrances
that
she
had
kept
secret
the
melancholy
confession
which
had
startled
her
on
the
last
night
of
her
life
at
school
wyvil
looked
at
alban
s
letter
again
do
you
know
how
miss
jethro
became
acquainted
with
mirabel
he
asked
i
didn
t
even
know
that
they
were
do
you
think
it
likely
if
morris
had
been
talking
to
you
instead
of
writing
to
you
that
he
might
have
said
more
than
he
has
said
in
his
letter
cecilia
had
hitherto
remained
a
model
of
discretion
seeing
emily
hesitate
temptation
overcame
her
not
a
doubt
of
it
papa
she
declared
confidently
is
cecilia
right
wyvil
inquired
reminded
in
this
way
of
her
influence
over
alban
emily
could
only
make
one
honest
reply
she
admitted
that
cecilia
was
right
wyvil
thereupon
advised
her
not
to
express
any
opinion
until
she
was
in
a
better
position
to
judge
for
herself
when
you
write
to
morris
he
continued
say
that
you
will
wait
to
tell
him
what
you
think
of
miss
jethro
until
you
see
him
i
have
no
prospect
at
present
of
seeing
him
again
emily
said
you
can
see
morris
whenever
it
suits
him
to
come
here
wyvil
replied
i
will
write
and
ask
him
to
visit
us
and
you
can
inclose
the
invitation
in
your
oh
wyvil
how
good
of
you
oh
papa
the
very
thing
i
was
going
to
ask
you
to
do
the
excellent
master
of
monksmoor
looked
unaffectedly
surprised
what
are
you
two
young
ladies
making
a
fuss
about
he
said
mr
morris
is
a
gentleman
by
profession
and
may
i
venture
to
say
it
miss
emily
a
valued
friend
of
yours
as
well
who
has
a
better
claim
to
be
one
of
my
guests
cecilia
stopped
her
father
as
he
was
about
to
leave
the
room
i
suppose
we
mustn
t
ask
mirabel
what
he
knows
of
miss
jethro
she
said
my
dear
what
can
you
be
thinking
of
what
right
have
we
to
question
mirabel
about
miss
jethro
it
s
so
very
unsatisfactory
papa
there
must
be
some
reason
why
emily
and
mirabel
ought
not
to
meet
or
why
should
miss
jethro
have
been
so
very
earnest
about
it
miss
jethro
doesn
t
intend
us
to
know
why
cecilia
it
will
perhaps
come
out
in
time
wait
for
left
together
the
girls
discussed
the
course
which
alban
would
probably
take
on
receiving
wyvil
s
invitation
he
will
only
be
too
glad
cecilia
asserted
to
have
the
opportunity
of
seeing
you
i
doubt
whether
he
will
care
about
seeing
me
again
among
strangers
emily
replied
and
you
forget
that
there
are
obstacles
in
his
way
how
is
he
to
leave
his
class
quite
easily
his
class
doesn
t
meet
on
the
saturday
he
can
be
here
if
he
starts
early
in
time
for
luncheon
and
he
can
stay
till
monday
or
who
is
to
take
his
place
at
the
school
miss
ladd
to
be
sure
if
make
a
point
of
it
write
to
her
as
well
as
to
the
letters
being
written
and
the
order
having
been
given
to
prepare
a
room
for
the
expected
guest
emily
and
cecilia
returned
to
the
they
found
the
elders
of
the
party
variously
engaged
the
men
with
newspapers
and
the
ladies
with
work
entering
the
conservatory
next
they
discovered
cecilia
s
sister
languishing
among
the
flowers
in
an
easy
chair
constitutional
laziness
in
some
young
ladies
assumes
an
invalid
character
and
presents
the
interesting
spectacle
of
perpetual
convalescence
the
doctor
declared
that
the
baths
at
moritz
had
cured
miss
julia
miss
julia
declined
to
agree
with
the
doctor
come
into
the
garden
with
emily
and
me
cecilia
said
emily
and
you
don
t
know
what
it
is
to
be
ill
julia
answered
the
two
girls
left
her
and
joined
the
young
people
who
were
amusing
themselves
in
the
garden
francine
had
taken
possession
of
mirabel
and
had
condemned
him
to
hard
labor
in
swinging
her
he
made
an
attempt
to
get
away
when
emily
and
cecilia
approached
and
was
peremptorily
recalled
to
his
duty
higher
cried
miss
de
sor
in
her
hardest
tones
of
authority
i
want
to
swing
higher
than
anybody
else
mirabel
submitted
with
resignation
and
was
rewarded
by
tender
encouragement
expressed
in
a
look
do
you
see
that
cecilia
whispered
he
knows
how
rich
she
is
i
wonder
whether
he
will
marry
emily
smiled
i
doubt
it
while
he
is
in
this
house
she
said
you
are
as
rich
as
francine
and
don
t
forget
that
you
have
other
attractions
as
cecilia
shook
her
head
mr
mirabel
is
very
nice
she
admitted
but
i
wouldn
t
marry
him
would
you
emily
secretly
compared
alban
with
mirabel
not
for
the
world
she
answered
the
next
day
was
the
day
of
mirabel
s
departure
his
admirers
among
the
ladies
followed
him
out
to
the
door
at
which
wyvil
s
carriage
was
waiting
francine
threw
a
nosegay
after
the
departing
guest
as
he
got
in
mind
you
come
back
to
us
on
monday
she
said
mirabel
bowed
and
thanked
her
but
his
last
look
was
for
emily
standing
apart
from
the
others
at
the
top
of
the
steps
francine
said
nothing
her
lips
closed
convulsively
she
turned
suddenly
pale
chapter
xli
speechifying
on
the
monday
a
plowboy
from
vale
regis
arrived
at
monksmoor
in
respect
of
himself
he
was
a
person
beneath
notice
in
respect
of
his
errand
he
was
sufficiently
important
to
cast
a
gloom
over
the
household
the
faithless
mirabel
had
broken
his
engagement
and
the
plowboy
was
the
herald
of
misfortune
who
brought
his
apology
to
his
great
disappointment
he
wrote
he
was
detained
by
the
affairs
of
his
parish
he
could
only
trust
to
wyvil
s
indulgence
to
excuse
him
and
to
communicate
his
sincere
sense
of
regret
on
scented
note
paper
to
the
ladies
everybody
believed
in
the
affairs
of
the
parish
with
the
exception
of
francine
mr
mirabel
has
made
the
best
excuse
he
could
think
of
for
shortening
his
visit
and
i
don
t
wonder
at
it
she
said
looking
significantly
at
emily
emily
was
playing
with
one
of
the
dogs
exercising
him
in
the
tricks
which
he
had
learned
she
balanced
a
morsel
of
sugar
on
his
nose
and
had
no
attention
to
spare
for
francine
cecilia
as
the
mistress
of
the
house
felt
it
her
duty
to
interfere
that
is
a
strange
remark
to
make
she
answered
do
you
mean
to
say
that
we
have
driven
mirabel
away
from
us
i
accuse
nobody
francine
began
with
spiteful
candor
now
she
s
going
to
accuse
everybody
emily
interposed
addressing
herself
facetiously
to
the
dog
but
when
girls
are
bent
on
fascinating
men
whether
they
like
it
or
not
francine
proceeded
men
have
only
one
alternative
they
must
keep
out
of
the
she
looked
again
at
emily
more
pointedly
than
ever
even
gentle
cecilia
resented
this
whom
do
you
refer
to
she
said
sharply
my
dear
emily
remonstrated
need
you
ask
she
glanced
at
francine
as
she
spoke
and
then
gave
the
dog
his
signal
he
tossed
up
the
sugar
and
caught
it
in
his
mouth
his
audience
applauded
him
and
so
for
that
time
the
skirmish
ended
among
the
letters
of
the
next
morning
s
delivery
arrived
alban
s
reply
emily
s
anticipations
proved
to
be
correct
the
s
du
ties
would
not
permit
him
to
leave
netherwoods
and
he
like
mirabel
sent
his
apologies
his
short
letter
to
emily
contained
no
further
allusion
to
miss
jethro
it
began
and
ended
on
the
first
page
had
he
been
disappointed
by
the
tone
of
reserve
in
which
emily
had
written
to
him
under
wyvil
s
advice
or
as
cecilia
suggested
had
his
detention
at
the
school
so
bitterly
disappointed
him
that
he
was
too
disheartened
to
write
at
any
length
emily
made
no
attempt
to
arrive
at
a
conclusion
either
one
way
or
the
other
she
seemed
to
be
in
depressed
spirits
and
she
spoke
superstitiously
for
the
first
time
in
cecilia
s
experience
of
her
i
don
t
like
this
reappearance
of
miss
jethro
she
said
if
the
mystery
about
that
woman
is
ever
cleared
up
it
will
bring
trouble
and
sorrow
to
me
and
i
believe
in
his
own
secret
heart
alban
morris
thinks
so
write
and
ask
him
cecilia
suggested
he
is
so
kind
and
so
unwilling
to
distress
me
emily
answered
that
he
wouldn
t
acknowledge
it
even
if
i
am
in
the
middle
of
the
week
the
course
of
private
life
at
monksmoor
suffered
an
interruption
due
to
the
parliamentary
position
of
the
master
of
the
house
the
insatiable
appetite
for
making
and
hearing
speeches
which
represents
one
of
the
marked
peculiarities
of
the
english
race
including
their
cousins
in
the
united
states
had
seized
on
wyvil
s
constituents
there
was
to
be
a
political
meeting
at
the
market
hall
in
the
neighboring
town
and
the
member
was
expected
to
make
an
oration
passing
in
review
contemporary
events
at
home
and
abroad
pray
don
t
think
of
accompanying
me
the
good
man
said
to
his
guests
the
hall
is
badly
ventilated
and
the
speeches
including
my
own
will
not
be
worth
this
humane
warning
was
ungratefully
disregarded
the
gentlemen
were
all
interested
in
the
objects
of
the
meeting
and
the
ladies
were
firm
in
the
resolution
not
to
be
left
at
home
by
themselves
they
dressed
with
a
view
to
the
large
assembly
of
spectators
before
whom
they
were
about
to
appear
and
they
outtalked
the
men
on
political
subjects
all
the
way
to
the
town
the
most
delightful
of
surprises
was
in
store
for
them
when
they
reached
the
market
hall
among
the
crowd
of
ordinary
gentlemen
waiting
under
the
portico
until
the
proceedings
began
appeared
one
person
of
distinction
whose
title
was
reverend
and
whose
name
was
mirabel
francine
was
the
first
to
discover
him
she
darted
up
the
steps
and
held
out
her
hand
this
a
pleasure
she
cried
have
you
come
here
to
see
she
was
about
to
say
me
but
observing
the
strangers
round
her
altered
the
word
to
us
please
give
me
your
arm
she
whispered
before
her
young
friends
had
arrived
within
hearing
i
am
so
frightened
in
a
crowd
she
held
fast
by
mirabel
and
kept
a
jealous
watch
on
him
was
it
only
her
fancy
or
did
she
detect
a
new
charm
in
his
smile
when
he
spoke
to
emily
before
it
was
possible
to
decide
the
time
for
the
meeting
had
arrived
wyvil
s
friends
were
of
course
accommodated
with
seats
on
the
platform
francine
still
insisting
on
her
claim
to
mirabel
s
arm
got
a
chair
next
to
him
as
she
seated
herself
she
left
him
free
for
a
moment
in
that
moment
the
infatuated
man
took
an
empty
chair
on
the
other
side
of
him
and
placed
it
for
emily
he
communicated
to
that
hated
rival
the
information
which
he
ought
to
have
reserved
for
francine
the
committee
insist
he
said
on
my
proposing
one
of
the
resolutions
i
promise
not
to
bore
you
mine
shall
be
the
shortest
speech
delivered
at
the
the
proceedings
began
among
the
earlier
speakers
not
one
was
inspired
by
a
feeling
of
mercy
for
the
audience
the
chairman
reveled
in
words
the
mover
and
seconder
of
the
first
resolution
not
having
so
much
as
the
ghost
of
an
idea
to
trouble
either
of
them
poured
out
language
in
flowing
and
overflowing
streams
like
water
from
a
perpetual
spring
the
heat
exhaled
by
the
crowded
audience
was
already
becoming
insufferable
cries
of
sit
down
assailed
the
orator
of
the
moment
the
chairman
was
obliged
to
interfere
a
man
at
the
back
of
the
hall
roared
out
ventilation
and
broke
a
window
with
his
stick
he
was
rewarded
with
three
rounds
of
cheers
and
was
ironically
invited
to
mount
the
platform
and
take
the
chair
under
these
embarrassing
circumstances
mirabel
rose
to
speak
he
secured
silence
at
the
outset
by
a
humorous
allusion
to
the
prolix
speaker
who
had
preceded
him
look
at
the
clock
gentlemen
he
said
and
limit
my
speech
to
an
interval
of
ten
the
applause
which
followed
was
heard
through
the
broken
window
in
the
street
the
boys
among
the
mob
outside
intercepted
the
flow
of
air
by
climbing
on
each
other
s
shoulders
and
looking
in
at
the
meeting
through
the
gaps
left
by
the
shattered
glass
having
proposed
his
resolution
with
discreet
brevity
of
speech
mirabel
courted
popularity
on
the
plan
adopted
by
the
late
lord
palmerston
in
the
house
of
commons
he
told
stories
and
made
jokes
adapted
to
the
intelligence
of
the
dullest
people
who
were
listening
to
him
the
charm
of
his
voice
and
manner
completed
his
success
punctually
at
the
tenth
minute
he
sat
down
amid
cries
of
go
francine
was
the
first
to
take
his
hand
and
to
express
admiration
mutely
by
pressing
it
he
returned
the
pressure
but
he
looked
at
the
wrong
lady
the
lady
on
the
other
side
although
she
made
no
complaint
he
instantly
saw
that
emily
was
overcome
by
the
heat
her
lips
were
white
and
her
eyes
were
closing
let
me
take
you
out
he
said
or
you
will
francine
started
to
her
feet
to
follow
them
the
lower
order
of
the
audience
eager
for
amusement
put
their
own
humorous
construction
on
the
young
lady
s
action
they
roared
with
laughter
let
the
parson
and
his
sweetheart
be
they
called
out
two
s
company
miss
and
three
isn
wyvil
interposed
his
authority
and
rebuked
them
a
lady
seated
behind
francine
interfered
to
good
purpose
by
giving
her
a
chair
which
placed
her
out
of
sight
of
the
audience
order
was
restored
and
the
proceedings
were
resumed
on
the
conclusion
of
the
meeting
mirabel
and
emily
were
found
waiting
for
their
friends
at
the
door
wyvil
innocently
added
fuel
to
the
fire
that
was
burning
in
francine
he
insisted
that
mirabel
should
return
to
monksmoor
and
offered
him
a
seat
in
the
carriage
at
emily
s
side
later
in
the
evening
when
they
all
met
at
dinner
there
appeared
a
change
in
miss
de
sor
which
surprised
everybody
but
mirabel
she
was
gay
and
and
especially
amiable
and
attentive
to
emily
who
sat
opposite
to
her
at
the
table
what
did
you
and
mirabel
talk
about
while
you
were
away
from
us
she
asked
innocently
politics
emily
readily
adopted
francine
s
friendly
tone
would
you
have
talked
politics
in
my
place
she
asked
gayly
in
your
place
i
should
have
had
the
most
delightful
of
companions
francine
rejoined
i
wish
i
had
been
overcome
by
the
heat
too
mirabel
attentively
observing
her
acknowledged
the
compliment
by
a
bow
and
left
emily
to
continue
the
conversation
in
perfect
good
faith
she
owned
to
having
led
mirabel
to
talk
of
himself
she
had
heard
from
cecilia
that
his
early
life
had
been
devoted
to
various
occupations
and
she
was
interested
in
knowing
how
circumstances
had
led
him
into
devoting
himself
to
the
church
francine
listened
with
the
outward
appearance
of
implicit
belief
and
with
the
inward
conviction
that
emily
was
deliberately
deceiving
her
when
the
little
narrative
was
at
an
end
she
was
more
agreeable
than
ever
she
admired
emily
s
dress
and
she
rivaled
cecilia
in
enjoyment
of
the
good
things
on
the
table
she
entertained
mirabel
with
humorous
anecdotes
of
the
priests
at
domingo
and
was
so
interested
in
the
manufacture
of
violins
ancient
and
modern
that
wyvil
promised
to
show
her
his
famous
collection
of
instruments
after
dinner
her
overflowing
amiability
included
even
poor
miss
darnaway
and
the
absent
brothers
and
sisters
she
heard
with
flattering
sympathy
how
they
had
been
ill
and
had
got
well
again
what
amusing
tricks
they
played
what
alarming
accidents
happened
to
them
and
how
remarkably
clever
they
were
including
i
do
assure
you
dear
miss
de
sor
the
baby
only
ten
months
when
the
ladies
rose
to
retire
francine
was
socially
speaking
the
heroine
of
the
evening
while
the
violins
were
in
course
of
exhibition
mirabel
found
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
emily
unobserved
have
you
said
or
done
anything
to
offend
miss
de
sor
he
asked
nothing
whatever
emily
declared
startled
by
the
question
what
makes
you
think
i
have
offended
her
i
have
been
trying
to
find
a
reason
for
the
change
in
her
mirabel
answered
especially
the
change
toward
well
well
she
means
mischief
of
what
sort
of
a
sort
which
may
expose
her
to
discovery
unless
she
disarms
suspicion
at
the
outset
that
is
as
i
believe
exactly
what
she
has
been
doing
this
evening
i
needn
t
warn
you
to
be
on
your
all
the
next
day
emily
was
on
the
watch
for
events
and
nothing
happened
not
the
slightest
appearance
of
jealousy
betrayed
itself
in
francine
she
made
no
attempt
to
attract
to
herself
the
attentions
of
mirabel
and
she
showed
no
hostility
to
emily
either
by
word
look
or
manner
the
day
after
an
event
occurred
at
netherwoods
alban
morris
received
an
anonymous
letter
addressed
to
him
in
these
terms
a
certain
young
lady
in
whom
you
are
supposed
to
be
interested
is
forgetting
you
in
your
absence
if
you
are
not
mean
enough
to
allow
yourself
to
be
supplanted
by
another
man

the
party
at
monksmoor
before
it
is

chapter
xlii
cooking
the
day
after
the
political
meeting
was
a
day
of
departures
at
the
pleasant
country
house
miss
darnaway
was
recalled
to
the
nursery
at
home
the
old
squire
who
did
justice
to
wyvil
s
went
away
next
having
guests
to
entertain
at
his
own
house
a
far
more
serious
loss
followed
the
three
dancing
men
had
engagements
which
drew
them
to
new
spheres
of
activity
in
other
they
said
with
the
same
dreary
grace
of
manner
very
sorry
to
go
they
drove
to
the
railway
arrayed
in
the
same
perfect
traveling
suits
of
neutral
tint
and
they
had
but
one
difference
of
opinion
among
them
each
firmly
believed
that
he
was
smoking
the
best
cigar
to
be
got
in
london
the
morning
after
these
departures
would
have
been
a
dull
morning
indeed
but
for
the
presence
of
mirabel
when
breakfast
was
over
the
invalid
miss
julia
established
herself
on
the
sofa
with
a
novel
her
father
retired
to
the
other
end
of
the
house
and
profaned
the
art
of
music
on
music
s
most
expressive
instrument
left
with
emily
cecilia
and
francine
mirabel
made
one
of
his
happy
suggestions
we
are
thrown
on
our
own
resources
he
said
let
us
distinguish
ourselves
by
inventing
some
entirely
new
amusement
for
the
day
you
young
ladies
shall
sit
in
council
and
i
will
be
he
turned
to
cecilia
the
meeting
waits
to
hear
the
mistress
of
the
modest
cecilia
appealed
to
her
school
friends
for
help
addressing
herself
in
the
first
instance
by
the
secretary
s
advice
to
francine
as
the
eldest
they
all
noticed
another
change
in
this
variable
young
person
she
was
silent
and
subdued
and
she
said
wearily
i
don
t
care
what
we
do
shall
we
go
out
riding
the
unanswerable
objection
to
riding
as
a
form
of
amusement
was
that
it
had
been
more
than
once
tried
already
something
clever
and
surprising
was
anticipated
from
emily
when
it
came
to
her
turn
she
too
disappointed
expectation
let
us
sit
under
the
trees
was
all
that
she
could
suggest
and
ask
mirabel
to
tell
us
a
mirabel
laid
down
his
pen
and
took
it
on
himself
to
reject
this
proposal
remember
he
remonstrated
that
i
have
an
interest
in
the
diversions
of
the
day
you
can
t
expect
me
to
be
amused
by
my
own
story
i
appeal
to
miss
wyvil
to
invent
a
pleasure
which
will
include
the
cecilia
blushed
and
looked
uneasy
i
think
i
have
got
an
idea
she
announced
after
some
hesitation
may
i
propose
that
we
all
go
to
the
keeper
s
lodge
there
her
courage
failed
her
and
she
hesitated
again
mirabel
gravely
registered
the
proposal
as
far
as
it
went
what
are
we
to
do
when
we
get
to
the
keeper
s
lodge
he
inquired
we
are
to
ask
the
keeper
s
wife
cecilia
proceeded
to
lend
us
her
to
lend
us
her
kitchen
mirabel
repeated
and
what
are
we
to
do
in
the
kitchen
cecilia
looked
down
at
her
pretty
hands
crossed
on
her
lap
and
answered
softly
cook
our
own
here
was
an
entirely
new
amusement
in
the
most
attractive
sense
of
the
words
here
was
charming
cecilia
s
interest
in
the
pleasures
of
the
table
so
happily
inspired
that
the
grateful
meeting
offered
its
tribute
of
applause
even
including
francine
the
members
of
the
council
were
young
their
daring
digestions
contemplated
without
fear
the
prospect
of
eating
their
own
amateur
cookery
the
one
question
that
troubled
them
now
was
what
they
were
to
cook
i
can
make
an
omelet
cecilia
ventured
to
say
if
there
is
any
cold
chicken
to
be
had
emily
added
i
undertake
to
follow
the
omelet
with
a
there
are
clergymen
in
the
church
of
england
who
are
even
clever
enough
to
fry
potatoes
mirabel
announced
and
i
am
one
of
them
what
shall
we
have
next
a
pudding
miss
de
sor
can
you
make
a
pudding
francine
exhibited
another
new
side
to
her
character
a
diffident
and
humble
side
i
am
ashamed
to
say
i
don
t
know
how
to
cook
anything
she
confessed
you
had
better
leave
me
out
of
but
cecilia
was
now
in
her
element
her
plan
of
operations
was
wide
enough
even
to
include
francine
you
shall
wash
the
lettuce
my
dear
and
stone
the
olives
for
emily
s
mayonnaise
don
t
be
discouraged
you
shall
have
a
companion
we
will
send
to
the
rectory
for
miss
plym
the
very
person
to
chop
parsley
and
shallot
for
my
omelet
oh
emily
what
a
morning
we
are
going
to
have
her
lovely
blue
eyes
sparkled
with
joy
she
gave
emily
a
kiss
which
mirabel
must
have
been
more
or
less
than
man
not
to
have
coveted
i
declare
cried
cecilia
completely
losing
her
head
i
m
so
excited
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
with
myself
emily
s
intimate
knowledge
of
her
friend
applied
the
right
remedy
you
don
t
know
what
to
do
with
yourself
she
repeated
have
you
no
sense
of
duty
give
the
cook
your
cecilia
instantly
recovered
her
presence
of
mind
she
sat
down
at
the
and
made
out
a
list
of
eatable
productions
in
the
animal
and
vegetable
world
in
which
every
other
word
was
underlined
two
or
three
times
over
her
serious
face
was
a
sight
to
see
when
she
rang
for
the
cook
and
the
two
held
a
privy
council
in
a
corner
on
the
way
to
the
keeper
s
lodge
the
young
mistress
of
the
house
headed
a
procession
of
servants
carrying
the
raw
materials
francine
followed
held
in
custody
by
miss
plym
who
took
her
responsibilities
seriously
and
clamored
for
instruction
in
the
art
of
chopping
parsley
mirabel
and
emily
were
together
far
behind
they
were
the
only
two
members
of
the
company
whose
minds
were
not
occupied
in
one
way
or
another
by
the
kitchen
this
child
s
play
of
ours
doesn
t
seem
to
interest
you
mirabel
remarked
i
am
thinking
emily
answered
of
what
you
said
to
me
about
i
can
say
something
more
he
rejoined
when
i
noticed
the
change
in
her
at
dinner
i
told
you
she
meant
mischief
there
is
another
change
which
suggests
to
my
mind
that
the
mischief
is
and
directed
against
me
emily
asked
mirabel
made
no
direct
reply
it
was
impossible
for
to
remind
her
that
she
had
no
matter
how
innocently
exposed
herself
to
the
jealous
hatred
of
francine
time
will
tell
us
what
we
don
t
know
now
he
replied
evasively
you
seem
to
have
faith
in
time
the
greatest
faith
time
is
the
inveterate
enemy
of
deceit
sooner
or
later
every
hidden
thing
is
a
thing
doomed
to
without
exception
yes
he
answered
positively
without
at
that
moment
francine
stopped
and
looked
back
at
them
did
she
think
that
emily
and
mirabel
had
been
talking
together
long
enough
miss
plym
with
the
parsley
still
on
her
mind
to
consult
emil
y
s
experience
the
two
walked
on
together
leaving
mirabel
to
overtake
francine
he
saw
in
her
first
look
at
him
the
effort
that
it
cost
her
to
suppress
those
emotions
which
the
pride
of
women
is
most
deeply
interested
in
concealing
before
a
word
had
passed
he
regretted
that
emily
had
left
them
together
i
wish
i
had
your
cheerful
disposition
she
began
abruptly
i
am
out
of
spirits
or
out
of
temper
i
don
t
know
which
and
i
don
t
know
why
do
you
ever
trouble
yourself
with
thinking
of
the
future
as
seldom
as
possible
miss
de
sor
in
such
a
situation
as
mine
most
people
have
prospects
i
have
he
spoke
gravely
conscious
of
not
feeling
at
ease
on
his
side
if
he
had
been
the
most
modest
man
that
ever
lived
he
must
have
seen
in
francine
s
face
that
she
loved
him
when
they
had
first
been
presented
to
each
other
she
was
still
under
the
influence
of
the
meanest
instincts
in
her
scheming
and
selfish
nature
she
had
thought
to
herself
with
my
money
to
help
him
that
man
s
celebrity
would
do
the
rest
the
best
society
in
england
would
be
glad
to
receive
mirabel
s
as
the
days
passed
strong
feeling
had
taken
the
place
of
those
contemptible
aspirations
mirabel
had
unconsciously
inspired
the
one
passion
which
was
powerful
enough
to
master
francine
sensual
passion
wild
hopes
rioted
in
her
measureless
desires
which
she
had
never
felt
before
united
themselves
with
capacities
for
wickedness
which
had
been
the
horrid
growth
of
a
few
nights
capacities
which
suggested
even
viler
attempts
to
rid
herself
of
a
supposed
rivalry
than
slandering
emily
by
means
of
an
anonymous
letter
without
waiting
for
it
to
be
offered
she
took
mirabel
s
arm
and
pressed
it
to
her
breast
as
they
slowly
walked
on
the
fear
of
discovery
which
had
troubled
her
after
she
had
sent
her
base
letter
to
the
post
vanished
at
that
inspiriting
moment
she
bent
her
head
near
enough
to
him
when
he
spoke
to
feel
his
breath
on
her
face
there
is
a
strange
similarity
she
said
softly
between
your
position
and
mine
is
there
anything
cheering
in
prospects
i
am
far
away
from
home
my
father
and
mother
wouldn
t
care
if
they
never
saw
me
again
people
talk
about
my
money
what
is
the
use
of
money
to
such
a
lonely
wretch
as
i
am
suppose
i
write
to
london
and
ask
the
lawyer
if
i
may
give
it
all
away
to
some
deserving
person
why
not
to
you
my
dear
miss
de
sor
is
there
anything
wrong
mirabel
in
wishing
that
i
could
make
you
a
prosperous
man
you
must
not
even
talk
of
such
a
thing
how
proud
you
are
she
said
submissively
oh
i
can
t
bear
to
think
of
you
in
that
miserable
village
a
position
so
unworthy
of
your
talents
and
your
claims
and
you
tell
me
i
must
not
talk
about
it
would
you
have
said
that
to
emily
if
she
was
as
anxious
as
i
am
to
see
you
in
your
right
place
in
the
world
i
should
have
answered
her
exactly
as
i
have
answered
she
will
never
embarrass
you
mirabel
by
being
as
sincere
as
i
am
emily
can
keep
her
own
is
she
to
blame
for
doing
that
it
depends
on
your
feeling
for
what
feeling
do
you
mean
suppose
you
heard
she
was
engaged
to
be
married
francine
suggested
mirabel
s
manner
studiously
cold
and
formal
thus
far
altered
on
a
sudden
he
looked
with
unconcealed
anxiety
at
francine
do
you
say
that
seriously
he
asked
i
said
i
don
t
exactly
know
that
she
is
what
you
know
oh
how
interested
you
are
in
emily
she
is
admired
by
some
people
are
you
one
of
them
mirabel
s
experience
of
women
warned
him
to
try
silence
as
a
means
of
provoking
her
into
speaking
plainly
the
experiment
succeeded
francine
returned
to
the
question
that
he
had
put
to
her
and
abruptly
answered
it
you
may
believe
me
or
not
as
you
like
i
know
of
a
man
who
is
in
love
with
her
he
has
had
his
opportunities
and
he
has
made
good
use
of
them
would
you
like
to
know
who
he
is
i
should
like
to
know
anything
which
you
may
wish
to
tell
he
did
his
best
to
make
the
reply
in
a
tone
of
commonplace
politeness
and
he
might
have
succeeded
in
deceiving
a
man
the
woman
s
quicker
ear
told
her
that
he
was
angry
francine
took
the
full
advantage
of
that
change
in
her
favor
i
am
afraid
your
good
opinion
of
emily
will
be
shaken
she
quietly
resumed
when
i
tell
you
that
she
has
encouraged
a
man
who
is
only
at
a
school
at
the
same
time
a
person
in
her
circumstances
i
mean
she
has
no
money
ought
not
to
be
very
hard
to
please
of
course
she
has
never
spoken
to
you
of
alban
morris
not
that
i
only
four
words
but
they
satisfied
francine
the
one
thing
wanting
to
complete
the
obstacle
which
she
had
now
placed
in
emily
s
way
was
that
alban
morris
should
enter
on
the
scene
he
might
hesitate
but
if
he
was
really
fond
of
emily
the
anonymous
letter
would
sooner
or
later
bring
him
to
monksmoor
in
the
meantime
her
object
was
gained
she
dropped
mirabel
s
arm
here
is
the
lodge
she
said
gayly
i
declare
cecilia
has
got
an
apron
on
already
come
and
chapter
xliii
sounding
mirabel
left
francine
to
enter
the
lodge
by
herself
his
mind
was
disturbed
he
felt
the
importance
of
gaining
time
for
reflection
before
he
and
emily
met
again
the
keeper
s
garden
was
at
the
back
of
the
lodge
passing
through
the
he
found
a
little
at
a
turn
in
the
path
nobody
was
there
he
went
in
and
sat
down
at
intervals
he
had
even
yet
encouraged
himself
to
underrate
the
true
importance
of
the
feeling
which
emily
had
awakened
in
him
there
was
an
end
to
all
now
after
what
francine
had
said
to
him
this
shallow
and
frivolous
man
no
longer
resisted
the
influence
of
love
he
shrank
under
the
one
terrible
question
that
forced
itself
on
his
mind
had
that
jealous
girl
spoken
the
truth
in
what
process
of
investigation
could
he
trust
to
set
this
anxiety
at
rest
to
apply
openly
to
emily
would
be
to
take
a
liberty
which
emily
was
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
permit
in
his
recent
intercourse
with
her
he
had
felt
more
strongly
than
ever
the
importance
of
speaking
with
reserve
he
had
been
scrupulously
careful
to
take
no
unfair
advantage
of
his
opportunity
when
he
had
removed
her
from
the
meeting
and
when
they
had
walked
together
with
hardly
a
creature
to
observe
them
in
the
lonely
outskirts
of
the
town
emily
s
gaiety
and
good
humor
had
not
led
him
astray
he
knew
that
these
were
bad
signs
viewed
in
the
interests
of
love
his
one
hope
of
touching
her
deeper
sympathies
was
to
wait
for
the
help
that
might
yet
come
from
time
and
chance
with
a
bitter
sigh
he
resigned
himself
to
the
necessity
of
being
as
agreeable
and
amusing
as
ever
it
was
just
possible
that
he
might
lure
her
into
alluding
to
alban
morris
if
he
began
innocently
by
making
her
laugh
as
he
rose
to
return
to
the
lodge
the
keeper
s
little
terrier
prowling
about
the
garden
looked
into
the
seeing
a
stranger
the
dog
showed
his
teeth
and
growled
mirabel
shrank
back
against
the
wall
behind
him
trembling
in
every
limb
his
eyes
stared
in
terror
as
the
dog
came
nearer
barking
in
high
triumph
over
the
discovery
of
a
frightened
man
whom
he
could
bully
mirabel
called
out
for
help
a
laborer
at
work
in
the
garden
ran
to
the
place
and
stopped
with
a
broad
grin
of
amusement
at
seeing
a
grown
man
terrified
by
a
barking
dog
well
he
said
to
himself
after
mirabel
had
passed
out
under
protection
there
goes
a
coward
if
ever
there
was
one
yet
mirabel
waited
a
minute
behind
the
lodge
to
recover
himself
he
had
been
so
completely
unnerved
that
his
hair
was
wet
with
perspiration
while
he
used
his
handkerchief
he
shuddered
at
other
recollections
than
the
recollection
of
the
dog
after
that
night
at
the
inn
he
thought
the
least
thing
frightens
me
he
was
received
by
the
young
ladies
with
cries
of
derisive
welcome
oh
for
shame
for
shame
here
are
the
potatoes
already
cut
and
nobody
to
fry
them
mirabel
assumed
the
mask
of
cheerfulness
with
the
desperate
resolution
of
an
actor
amusing
his
audience
at
a
time
of
domestic
distress
he
astonished
the
keeper
s
wife
by
showing
that
he
really
knew
how
to
use
her
cecilia
s
omelet
was
tough
but
the
young
ladies
ate
it
emily
s
mayonnaise
sauce
was
almost
as
liquid
as
water
they
swallowed
it
nevertheless
by
the
help
of
spoons
the
potatoes
followed
crisp
and
dry
and
delicious
and
mirabel
became
more
popular
than
ever
he
is
the
only
one
of
us
cecilia
sadly
acknowledged
who
knows
how
to
when
they
all
left
the
lodge
for
a
stroll
in
the
park
francine
attached
herself
to
cecilia
and
miss
plym
she
resigned
mirabel
to
emily
in
the
happy
belief
that
she
had
paved
the
way
for
a
misunderstanding
between
them
the
merriment
at
the
luncheon
table
had
revived
emily
s
good
spirits
she
had
a
remembrance
of
the
failure
of
her
sauce
mirabel
saw
her
smiling
to
herself
may
i
ask
what
amuses
you
he
said
i
was
thinking
of
the
debt
of
gratitude
that
we
owe
to
wyvil
she
replied
if
he
had
not
persuaded
you
to
return
to
monksmoor
we
should
never
have
seen
the
famous
mirabel
with
a
frying
pan
in
his
hand
and
never
have
tasted
the
only
good
dish
at
our
mirabel
tried
vainly
to
adopt
his
companion
s
easy
tone
now
that
he
was
alone
with
her
the
doubts
that
francine
had
aroused
shook
the
prudent
resolution
at
which
he
had
arrived
in
the
garden
he
ran
the
risk
and
told
emily
plainly
why
he
had
returned
to
wyvil
s
house
although
i
am
sensible
of
our
host
s
kindness
he
answered
i
should
have
gone
back
to
my
parsonage
but
for
she
declined
to
understand
him
seriously
then
the
affairs
of
your
parish
are
neglected
and
i
am
to
blame
she
said
am
i
the
first
man
who
has
neglected
his
duties
for
your
sake
he
asked
i
wonder
whether
the
masters
at
school
had
the
heart
to
report
you
when
you
neglected
your
lessons
she
thought
of
alban
and
betrayed
herself
by
a
heightened
color
the
moment
after
she
changed
the
subject
mirabel
could
no
longer
resist
the
conclusion
that
francine
had
told
him
the
truth
when
do
you
leave
us
she
inquired
is
saturday
i
must
go
back
as
and
how
will
your
deserted
parish
receive
you
he
made
a
desperate
effort
to
be
as
amusing
as
usual
i
am
sure
of
preserving
my
popularity
he
said
while
i
have
a
cask
in
the
cellar
and
a
few
spare
sixpences
in
my
pocket
the
public
spirit
of
my
parishioners
asks
for
nothing
but
money
and
beer
before
i
went
to
that
wearisome
meeting
i
told
my
housekeeper
that
i
was
going
to
make
a
speech
about
reform
she
didn
t
know
what
i
meant
i
explained
that
reform
might
increase
the
number
of
british
citizens
who
had
the
right
of
voting
at
elections
for
parliament
she
brightened
up
directly
ah
she
said
i
ve
heard
my
husband
talk
about
elections
the
more
there
are
of
them
says
the
more
money
he
ll
get
for
his
vote
i
m
all
for
on
my
way
out
of
the
house
i
tried
the
man
who
works
in
my
garden
on
the
same
subject
he
didn
t
look
at
the
matter
from
the
housekeeper
s
sanguine
point
of
view
i
don
t
deny
that
parliament
once
gave
me
a
good
dinner
for
nothing
at
the
he
admitted
but
that
was
years
ago
and
you
ll
excuse
me
sir
i
hear
nothing
of
another
dinner
to
come
it
s
a
matter
of
opinion
of
course
i
don
t
myself
believe
in
there
are
specimens
of
the
state
of
public
spirit
in
our
village
he
paused
emily
was
listening
but
he
had
not
succeeded
in
choosing
a
subject
that
amused
her
he
tried
a
topic
more
nearly
connected
with
his
own
interests
the
topic
of
the
future
our
good
friend
has
asked
me
to
prolong
my
visit
after
sunday
s
duties
are
over
he
said
i
hope
i
shall
find
you
here
next
week
will
the
affairs
of
your
parish
allow
you
to
come
back
emily
asked
mischievously
the
affairs
of
my
parish
if
you
force
me
to
confess
it
were
only
an
an
excuse
for
what
an
excuse
for
keeping
away
from
monksmoor
in
the
interests
of
my
own
tranquillity
the
experiment
has
failed
while
you
are
here
i
can
t
keep
she
still
declined
to
understand
him
seriously
must
i
tell
you
in
plain
words
that
flattery
is
thrown
away
on
me
she
said
flattery
is
not
offered
to
you
he
answered
gravely
i
beg
your
pardon
for
having
led
to
the
mistake
by
talking
of
having
appealed
to
her
indulgence
by
that
act
of
submission
he
ventured
on
another
distant
allusion
to
the
man
whom
he
hated
and
feared
shall
i
meet
any
friends
of
yours
he
resumed
when
i
return
on
monday
what
do
you
mean
i
only
meant
to
ask
if
wyvil
expects
any
new
guests
as
he
put
the
question
cecilia
s
voice
was
heard
behind
them
calling
to
emily
they
both
turned
round
wyvil
had
joined
his
daughter
and
her
two
friends
he
advanced
to
meet
emily
i
have
some
news
for
you
that
you
little
expect
he
said
a
telegram
has
just
arrived
from
netherwoods
alban
morris
has
got
leave
of
absence
and
is
coming
here
chapter
xliv
competing
time
at
monksmoor
had
advanced
to
the
half
hour
before
dinner
on
saturday
evening
cecilia
and
francine
wyvil
and
mirabel
were
loitering
in
the
conservatory
in
the
emily
had
been
considerately
left
alone
with
alban
he
had
missed
the
early
train
from
netherwoods
but
he
had
arrived
in
time
to
dress
for
dinner
and
to
offer
the
necessary
explanations
if
it
had
been
possible
for
alban
to
allude
to
the
anonymous
letter
he
might
have
owned
that
his
first
impulse
had
led
him
to
destroy
it
and
to
assert
his
confidence
in
emily
by
refusing
wyvil
s
invitation
but
try
as
he
might
to
forget
them
the
base
words
that
he
had
read
remained
in
his
memory
irritating
him
at
the
outset
they
had
ended
in
rousing
his
jealousy
under
that
delusive
influence
he
persuaded
himself
that
he
had
acted
in
the
first
instance
without
due
consideration
it
was
surely
his
interest
it
might
even
be
his
duty
to
go
to
wyvil
s
house
and
judge
for
himself
after
some
last
wretched
moments
of
hesitation
he
had
decided
on
effecting
a
compromise
with
his
own
better
sense
by
consulting
miss
ladd
that
excellent
lady
did
exactly
what
he
had
expected
her
to
do
she
made
arrangements
which
granted
him
leave
of
absence
from
the
saturday
to
the
tuesday
following
the
excuse
which
had
served
him
in
telegraphing
to
wyvil
must
now
be
repeated
in
accounting
for
his
unexpected
appearance
to
emily
i
found
a
person
to
take
charge
of
my
class
he
said
and
i
gladly
availed
myself
of
the
opportunity
of
seeing
you
after
observing
him
attentively
while
he
was
speaking
to
her
emily
owned
with
her
customary
frankness
that
she
had
noticed
something
in
his
manner
which
left
her
not
quite
at
her
ease
i
wonder
she
said
if
there
is
any
foundation
for
a
doubt
that
has
troubled
me
to
his
unutterable
relief
she
at
once
explained
what
the
doubt
was
i
am
afraid
i
offended
you
in
replying
to
your
letter
about
miss
in
this
case
alban
could
enjoy
the
luxury
of
speaking
unreservedly
he
confessed
that
emily
s
letter
had
disappointed
him
i
expected
you
to
answer
me
with
less
reserve
he
replied
and
i
began
to
think
i
had
acted
rashly
in
writing
to
you
at
all
when
there
is
a
better
opportunity
i
may
have
a
word
to
say
he
was
apparently
interrupted
by
something
that
he
saw
in
the
conservatory
looking
that
way
emily
perceived
that
mirabel
was
the
object
which
had
attracted
alban
s
attention
the
vile
anonymous
letter
was
in
his
mind
again
without
a
preliminary
word
to
prepare
emily
he
suddenly
changed
the
subject
how
do
you
like
the
clergyman
he
asked
very
much
indeed
she
replied
without
the
slightest
embarrassment
mr
mirabel
is
clever
and
agreeable
and
not
at
all
spoiled
by
his
success
i
am
sure
she
said
innocently
you
will
like
him
alban
s
face
answered
her
unmistakably
in
the
negative
sense
but
emily
s
attention
was
drawn
the
other
way
by
francine
she
joined
them
at
the
moment
on
the
lookout
for
any
signs
of
an
encouraging
result
which
her
treachery
might
already
have
produced
alban
had
been
inclined
to
suspect
her
when
he
had
received
the
letter
he
rose
and
bowed
as
she
approached
something
he
was
unable
to
realize
what
it
was
told
him
in
the
moment
when
they
looked
at
each
other
that
his
suspicion
had
hit
the
mark
in
the
conservatory
the
mirabel
had
left
his
friends
for
a
while
in
search
of
flowers
for
cecilia
she
turned
to
her
father
when
they
were
alone
and
asked
him
which
of
the
gentlemen
was
to
take
her
in
to
dinner
mirabel
or
morris
mr
morris
of
course
he
answered
he
is
the
new
guest
and
he
turns
out
to
be
more
than
the
equal
of
our
other
friend
when
i
showed
him
his
room
i
asked
if
he
was
related
to
a
man
who
bore
the
same
name
a
fellow
student
of
mine
years
and
years
ago
at
college
he
is
my
friend
s
younger
son
one
of
a
ruined
family
but
persons
of
high
distinction
in
their
mirabel
returned
with
the
flowers
just
as
dinner
was
announced
you
are
to
take
emily
cecilia
said
to
him
leading
the
way
out
of
the
conservatory
as
they
entered
the
alban
was
just
offering
his
arm
to
emily
papa
gives
you
to
me
morris
cecilia
explained
pleasantly
alban
hesitated
apparently
not
understanding
the
allusion
mirabel
interfered
with
his
best
grace
mr
wyvil
offers
you
the
honor
of
taking
his
daughter
to
the
alban
s
face
darkened
ominously
as
the
elegant
little
clergyman
gave
his
arm
to
emily
and
followed
wyvil
and
francine
out
of
the
room
cecilia
looked
at
her
silent
and
surly
companion
and
almost
envied
her
lazy
sister
dining
under
cover
of
a
convenient
headache
in
her
own
room
having
already
made
up
his
mind
that
alban
morris
required
careful
handling
mirabel
waited
a
little
before
he
led
the
conversation
as
usual
between
the
soup
and
the
fish
he
made
an
interesting
confession
addressed
to
emily
in
the
strictest
confidence
i
have
taken
a
fancy
to
your
friend
morris
he
said
first
impressions
in
my
case
decide
everything
i
like
people
or
dislike
them
on
impulse
that
man
appeals
to
my
sympathies
is
he
a
good
talker
i
should
say
yes
emily
answered
prettily
if
were
not
mirabel
was
not
to
be
beaten
even
by
a
woman
in
the
art
of
paying
compliments
he
looked
admiringly
at
alban
sitting
opposite
to
him
and
said
let
us
this
flattering
suggestion
not
only
pleased
emily
it
artfully
served
mirabel
s
purpose
that
is
to
say
it
secured
him
an
opportunity
for
observation
of
what
was
going
on
at
the
other
side
of
the
table
alban
s
instincts
as
a
gentleman
had
led
him
to
control
his
irritation
and
to
regret
that
he
had
suffered
it
to
appear
anxious
to
please
he
presented
himself
at
his
best
gentle
cecilia
forgave
and
forgot
the
angry
look
which
had
startled
her
wyvil
was
delighted
with
the
son
of
his
old
friend
emily
felt
secretly
proud
of
the
good
opinions
which
her
admirer
was
gathering
and
francine
saw
with
pleasure
that
he
was
asserting
his
claim
to
emily
s
preference
in
the
way
of
all
others
which
would
be
most
likely
to
discourage
his
rival
these
various
impressions
produced
while
alban
s
enemy
was
ominously
silent
began
to
suffer
an
imperceptible
change
from
the
moment
when
mirabel
decided
that
his
time
had
come
to
take
the
lead
a
remark
made
by
alban
offered
him
the
chance
for
which
he
had
been
on
the
watch
he
agreed
with
the
remark
he
enlarged
on
the
remark
he
was
brilliant
and
familiar
and
instructive
and
amusing
and
still
it
was
all
due
to
the
remark
alban
s
temper
was
once
more
severely
tried
mirabel
s
mischievous
object
had
not
escaped
his
penetration
he
did
his
best
to
put
obstacles
in
the
adversary
s
way
and
was
baffled
time
after
time
with
the
readiest
ingenuity
if
he
interrupted
the
clergyman
submitted
and
went
on
if
he
differed
modest
mirabel
said
in
the
most
amiable
manner
i
daresay
i
am
wrong
and
handled
the
topic
from
his
opponent
s
point
of
view
never
had
such
a
perfect
christian
sat
before
at
wyvil
s
table
not
a
hard
word
not
an
impatient
look
escaped
him
the
longer
alban
resisted
the
more
surely
he
lost
ground
in
the
general
estimation
cecilia
was
disappointed
emily
was
grieved
wyvil
s
favorable
opinion
began
to
waver
francine
was
disgusted
when
dinner
was
over
and
the
carriage
was
waiting
to
take
the
shepherd
back
to
his
flock
by
moonlight
mirabel
s
triumph
was
complete
he
had
made
alban
the
innocent
means
of
publicly
exhibiting
his
perfect
temper
and
perfect
politeness
under
their
best
and
brightest
aspect
so
that
day
ended
sunday
promised
to
pass
quietly
in
the
absence
of
mirabel
the
morning
came
and
it
seemed
doubtful
whether
the
promise
would
be
fulfilled
francine
had
passed
an
uneasy
night
no
such
encouraging
result
as
she
had
anticipated
had
hitherto
followed
the
appearance
of
alban
morris
at
monksmoor
he
had
clumsily
allowed
mirabel
to
improve
his
position
while
he
had
himself
lost
ground
in
emily
s
estimation
if
this
first
disastrous
consequence
of
the
meeting
between
the
two
men
was
permitted
to
repeat
itself
on
future
occasions
emily
and
mirabel
would
be
brought
more
closely
together
and
alban
himself
would
be
the
unhappy
cause
of
it
francine
rose
on
the
sunday
morning
before
the
table
was
laid
for
breakfast
resolved
to
try
the
effect
of
a
timely
word
of
advice
her
bedroom
was
situated
in
the
front
of
the
house
the
man
she
was
looking
for
presently
passed
within
her
range
of
view
from
the
window
on
his
way
to
take
a
morning
walk
in
the
park
she
followed
him
immediately
he
raised
his
hat
and
bowed
without
speaking
and
without
looking
at
her
we
resemble
each
other
in
one
particular
she
proceeded
graciously
we
both
like
to
breathe
the
fresh
air
before
he
said
exactly
what
common
politeness
obliged
him
to
say
and
no
more
he
said
some
girls
might
have
been
discouraged
francine
went
on
it
is
no
fault
of
mine
morris
that
we
have
not
been
better
friends
for
some
reason
into
which
i
don
t
presume
to
inquire
you
seem
to
distrust
me
i
really
don
t
know
what
i
have
done
to
deserve
are
you
sure
of
that
he
asked
eying
her
suddenly
and
searchingly
as
he
spoke
her
hard
face
settled
into
a
rigid
look
her
eyes
met
his
eyes
with
a
stony
defiant
stare
now
for
the
first
time
she
knew
that
he
suspected
her
of
having
written
the
anonymous
letter
every
evil
quality
in
her
nature
steadily
defied
him
a
hardened
old
woman
could
not
have
sustained
the
shock
of
discovery
with
a
more
devilish
composure
than
this
girl
displayed
perhaps
you
will
explain
yourself
she
said
i
explained
myself
he
answered
then
i
must
be
content
she
rejoined
to
remain
in
the
dark
i
had
intended
out
of
my
regard
for
emily
to
suggest
that
you
might
with
advantage
to
yourself
and
to
interests
that
are
very
dear
to
you
be
more
careful
in
your
behavior
to
mirabel
are
you
disposed
to
listen
to
me
do
you
wish
me
to
answer
that
question
plainly
miss
de
sor
i
insist
on
your
answering
it
then
i
am
disposed
to
listen
to
may
i
know
why
or
am
i
to
be
left
in
the
dark
again
you
are
to
be
left
if
you
please
to
your
own
francine
looked
at
him
with
a
malignant
smile
one
of
these
days
morris
i
will
deserve
your
confidence
in
my
she
said
it
and
went
back
to
the
house
this
was
the
only
element
of
disturbance
that
troubled
the
perfect
tranquillity
of
the
day
what
francine
had
proposed
to
do
with
the
one
idea
of
making
alban
serve
her
purpose
was
accomplished
a
few
hours
later
by
emily
s
influence
for
good
over
the
man
who
loved
her
they
passed
the
afternoon
together
uninterruptedly
in
the
distant
solitudes
of
the
park
in
the
course
of
conversation
emily
found
an
opportunity
of
discreetly
alluding
to
mirabel
you
mustn
t
be
jealous
of
our
clever
little
friend
she
said
i
like
him
and
admire
him
but
but
you
don
t
love
him
she
smiled
at
the
eager
way
in
which
alban
put
the
question
there
is
no
fear
of
that
she
answered
brightly
not
even
if
you
discovered
that
he
loves
you
not
even
then
are
you
content
at
last
promise
me
not
to
be
rude
to
mirabel
for
his
sake
no
for
my
sake
i
don
t
like
to
see
you
place
yourself
at
a
disadvantage
toward
another
man
i
don
t
like
you
to
disappoint
the
happiness
of
hearing
her
say
those
words
transfigured
him
the
manly
beauty
of
his
earlier
and
happier
years
seemed
to
have
returned
to
alban
he
took
her
hand
he
was
too
agitated
to
speak
you
are
forgetting
mirabel
she
reminded
him
gently
i
will
be
all
that
is
civil
and
kind
to
mirabel
i
will
like
him
and
admire
him
as
you
do
oh
emily
are
you
a
little
only
a
very
little
fond
of
me
i
don
t
quite
may
i
try
to
find
out
how
she
asked
her
fair
cheek
was
very
near
to
him
the
color
on
it
said
answer
me
here
and
he
answered
chapter
xlv
mischief
making
on
monday
mirabel
made
his
appearance
and
the
demon
of
discord
returned
with
him
alban
had
employed
the
earlier
part
of
the
day
in
making
a
sketch
in
the
park
intended
as
a
little
present
for
emily
presenting
himself
in
the
when
his
work
was
completed
he
found
cecilia
and
francine
alone
he
asked
where
emily
was
the
question
had
been
addressed
to
cecilia
francine
answered
it
emily
mustn
t
be
disturbed
she
said
why
not
she
is
with
mirabel
in
the
rose
garden
i
saw
them
talking
together
evidently
feeling
the
deepest
interest
in
what
they
were
saying
to
each
other
don
t
interrupt
them
you
will
only
be
in
the
cecilia
at
once
protested
against
this
last
assertion
she
is
trying
to
make
mischief
morris
don
t
believe
her
i
am
sure
they
will
be
glad
to
see
you
if
you
join
them
in
the
francine
rose
and
left
the
room
she
turned
and
looked
at
alban
as
she
opened
the
door
try
it
she
said
and
you
will
find
i
am
francine
sometimes
talks
in
a
very
way
cecilia
gently
remarked
do
you
think
she
means
it
morris
i
had
better
not
offer
an
opinion
alban
replied
why
i
can
t
speak
impartially
i
dislike
miss
de
there
was
a
pause
alban
s
sense
of
forbade
him
to
try
the
experiment
which
francine
had
maliciously
suggested
his
thoughts
less
easy
to
restrain
wandered
in
the
direction
of
the
garden
the
attempt
to
make
him
jealous
had
failed
but
he
was
conscious
at
the
same
time
that
emily
had
disappointed
him
after
what
they
had
said
to
each
other
in
the
park
she
ought
to
have
remembered
that
women
are
at
the
mercy
of
appearances
if
mirabel
had
something
of
importance
to
say
to
her
she
might
have
avoided
exposing
herself
to
francine
s
spiteful
misconstruction
it
would
have
been
easy
to
arrange
with
cecilia
that
a
third
person
should
be
present
at
the
interview
while
he
was
absorbed
in
these
reflections
cecilia
embarrassed
by
the
silence
was
trying
to
find
a
topic
of
conversation
alban
roughly
pushed
his
away
from
him
on
the
table
was
he
displeased
with
emily
the
same
question
had
occurred
to
cecilia
at
the
time
of
the
correspondence
on
the
subject
of
miss
jethro
to
recall
those
letters
led
her
by
natural
sequence
to
another
effort
of
memory
she
was
reminded
of
the
person
who
had
been
the
cause
of
the
correspondence
her
interest
was
revived
in
the
mystery
of
miss
jethro
has
emily
told
you
that
i
have
seen
your
letter
she
asked
he
roused
himself
with
a
start
i
beg
your
pardon
what
letter
are
you
thinking
of
i
was
thinking
of
the
letter
which
mentions
miss
jethro
s
strange
visit
emily
was
so
puzzled
and
so
surprised
that
she
showed
it
to
me
and
we
both
consulted
my
father
have
you
spoken
to
emily
about
miss
jethro
i
have
tried
but
she
seemed
to
be
unwilling
to
pursue
the
have
you
made
any
discoveries
since
you
wrote
to
emily
no
the
mystery
is
as
impenetrable
as
as
he
replied
in
those
terms
mirabel
entered
the
conservatory
from
the
garden
evidently
on
his
way
to
the
to
see
the
man
whose
introduction
to
emily
it
had
been
miss
jethro
s
mysterious
object
to
prevent
at
the
very
moment
when
he
had
been
speaking
of
miss
jethro
herself
was
not
only
a
temptation
of
curiosity
but
a
direct
incentive
in
emily
s
own
interests
to
make
an
effort
at
discovery
alban
pursued
the
conversation
with
cecilia
in
a
tone
which
was
loud
enough
to
be
heard
in
the
conservatory
the
one
chance
of
getting
any
information
that
i
can
see
he
proceeded
is
to
speak
to
i
shall
be
only
too
glad
if
i
can
be
of
any
service
to
miss
wyvil
and
with
those
obliging
words
mirabel
made
a
dramatic
entry
and
looked
at
cecilia
with
his
irresistible
smile
startled
by
his
sudden
appearance
she
unconsciously
assisted
alban
s
design
her
silence
gave
him
the
opportunity
of
speaking
in
her
place
we
were
talking
he
said
quietly
to
mirabel
of
a
lady
with
whom
you
are
indeed
may
i
ask
the
lady
s
name
miss
mirabel
sustained
the
shock
with
extraordinary
so
far
as
any
betrayal
by
sudden
movement
was
concerned
but
his
color
told
the
truth
it
faded
to
paleness
it
revealed
even
to
cecilia
s
eyes
a
man
overpowered
by
fright
alban
offered
him
a
chair
he
refused
to
take
it
by
a
gesture
alban
tried
an
apology
next
i
am
afraid
i
have
ignorantly
revived
some
painful
associations
pray
excuse
the
apology
roused
mirabel
he
felt
the
necessity
of
offering
some
explanation
in
timid
animals
the
one
defensive
capacity
which
is
always
ready
for
action
is
cunning
mirabel
was
too
wily
to
dispute
the
inference
the
inevitable
inference
which
any
one
must
have
drawn
after
seeing
the
effect
on
him
that
the
name
of
miss
jethro
had
produced
he
admitted
that
painful
associations
had
been
revived
and
deplored
the
nervous
sensibility
which
had
permitted
it
to
be
seen
no
blame
can
possibly
attach
to
my
dear
sir
he
continued
in
his
most
amiable
manner
will
it
be
indiscreet
on
my
part
if
i
ask
how
you
first
became
acquainted
with
miss
jethro
i
first
became
acquainted
with
her
at
miss
ladd
s
school
alban
answered
she
was
for
a
short
time
only
one
of
the
teachers
and
she
left
her
situation
rather
he
paused
but
mirabel
made
no
remark
after
an
interval
of
a
few
months
he
resumed
i
saw
miss
jethro
again
she
called
on
me
at
my
lodgings
near
merely
to
renew
your
former
acquaintance
mirabel
made
that
inquiry
with
an
eager
anxiety
for
the
reply
which
he
was
quite
unable
to
conceal
had
he
any
reason
to
dread
what
miss
jethro
might
have
it
in
her
power
to
say
of
him
to
another
person
alban
was
in
no
way
pledged
to
secrecy
and
he
was
determined
to
leave
no
means
untried
of
throwing
light
on
miss
jethro
s
mysterious
warning
he
repeated
the
plain
narrative
of
the
interview
which
he
had
communicated
by
letter
to
emily
mirabel
listened
without
making
any
remark
after
what
i
have
told
you
can
you
give
me
no
explanation
alban
asked
i
am
quite
unable
morris
to
help
was
he
lying
or
speaking
the
truth
the
impression
produced
on
alban
was
that
he
had
spoken
the
truth
women
are
never
so
ready
as
men
to
resign
themselves
to
the
disappointment
of
their
hopes
cecilia
silently
listening
up
to
this
time
now
ventured
to
speak
animated
by
her
sisterly
interest
in
emily
can
you
not
tell
us
she
said
to
mirabel
why
miss
jethro
tried
to
prevent
emily
brown
from
meeting
you
here
i
know
no
more
of
her
motive
than
you
do
mirabel
replied
alban
interposed
miss
jethro
left
me
he
said
with
the
intention
quite
openly
expressed
of
trying
to
prevent
you
from
accepting
wyvil
s
invitation
did
she
make
the
attempt
mirabel
admitted
that
she
had
made
the
attempt
but
he
added
without
mentioning
miss
emily
s
name
i
was
asked
to
postpone
my
visit
as
a
favor
to
herself
because
she
had
her
own
reasons
for
wishing
it
i
had
reasons
he
bowed
with
gallantry
to
cecilia
for
being
eager
to
have
the
honor
of
knowing
wyvil
and
his
daughter
and
i
once
more
the
doubt
arose
was
he
lying
or
speaking
the
truth
and
once
more
alban
could
not
resist
the
conclusion
that
he
was
speaking
the
truth
there
is
one
thing
i
should
like
to
know
mirabel
continued
after
some
hesitation
has
miss
emily
been
informed
of
this
strange
affair
certainly
mirabel
seemed
to
be
disposed
to
continue
his
inquiries
and
suddenly
changed
his
mind
was
he
beginning
to
doubt
if
alban
had
spoken
without
concealment
in
describing
miss
jethro
s
visit
was
he
still
afraid
of
what
miss
jethro
might
have
said
of
him
in
any
case
he
changed
the
subject
and
made
an
excuse
for
leaving
the
room
i
am
forgetting
my
errand
he
said
to
alban
miss
emily
was
anxious
to
know
if
you
had
finished
your
sketch
i
must
tell
her
that
you
have
he
bowed
and
withdrew
alban
rose
to
follow
him
and
checked
himself
no
he
thought
i
trust
emily
he
sat
down
again
by
cecilia
s
side
mirabel
had
indeed
returned
to
the
rose
garden
he
found
emily
employed
as
he
had
left
her
in
making
a
crown
of
roses
to
be
worn
by
cecilia
in
the
evening
but
in
one
other
respect
there
was
a
change
francine
was
present
excuse
me
for
sending
you
on
a
needless
errand
emily
said
to
mirabel
miss
de
sor
tells
me
morris
has
finished
his
sketch
she
left
him
in
the
why
didn
t
you
bring
him
here
he
was
talking
with
miss
mirabel
answered
absently
with
his
eyes
on
francine
he
gave
her
one
of
those
significant
looks
which
says
to
a
third
person
why
are
you
here
francine
s
jealousy
declined
to
understand
him
he
tried
a
broader
hint
in
words
are
you
going
to
walk
in
the
garden
he
said
francine
was
impenetrable
no
she
answered
i
am
going
to
stay
here
with
mirabel
had
no
choice
but
to
yield
imperative
anxieties
forced
him
to
say
in
francine
s
presence
what
he
had
hoped
to
say
to
emily
privately
when
i
joined
miss
wyvil
and
morris
he
began
what
do
you
think
they
were
doing
they
were
talking
of
miss
emily
dropped
the
on
her
lap
it
was
easy
to
see
that
she
had
been
disagreeably
surprised
mr
morris
has
told
me
the
curious
story
of
miss
jethro
s
visit
mirabel
continued
but
i
am
in
some
doubt
whether
he
has
spoken
to
me
without
reserve
perhaps
he
expressed
himself
more
freely
when
he
spoke
to
miss
jethro
may
have
said
something
to
him
which
tended
to
lower
me
in
your
estimation
certainly
not
mirabel
so
far
as
i
know
if
i
had
heard
anything
of
the
kind
i
should
have
thought
it
my
duty
to
tell
you
will
it
relieve
your
anxiety
if
i
go
at
once
to
morris
and
ask
him
plainly
whether
he
has
concealed
anything
from
you
or
from
me
mirabel
gratefully
kissed
her
hand
your
kindness
overpowers
me
he
said
speaking
for
once
with
true
emotion
emily
immediately
returned
to
the
house
as
soon
as
she
was
out
of
sight
francine
approached
mirabel
trembling
with
suppressed
rage
chapter
xlvi
pretending
miss
de
sor
began
cautiously
with
an
apology
excuse
me
mirabel
for
reminding
you
of
my
mirabel
made
no
reply
i
beg
to
say
francine
proceeded
that
i
didn
t
intentionally
see
you
kiss
emily
s
mirabel
stood
looking
at
the
roses
which
emily
had
left
on
her
chair
as
completely
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
as
if
he
had
been
alone
in
the
garden
am
i
not
even
worth
notice
francine
asked
ah
i
know
to
whom
i
am
indebted
for
your
neglect
she
took
him
familiarly
by
the
arm
and
burst
into
a
harsh
laugh
tell
me
now
in
confidence
do
you
think
emily
is
fond
of
you
the
impression
left
by
emily
s
kindness
was
still
fresh
in
mirabel
s
memory
he
was
in
no
humor
to
submit
to
the
jealous
resentment
of
a
woman
whom
he
regarded
with
perfect
indifference
through
the
varnish
of
politeness
which
overlaid
his
manner
there
rose
to
the
surface
the
underlying
insolence
hidden
on
all
ordinary
occasions
from
all
human
eyes
he
answered
francine
mercilessly
answered
her
at
last
it
is
the
dearest
hope
of
my
life
that
she
may
be
fond
of
me
he
said
francine
dropped
his
arm
and
fortune
favors
your
hopes
she
added
with
an
ironical
assumption
of
interest
in
mirabel
s
prospects
when
morris
leaves
us
he
removes
the
only
obstacle
you
have
to
fear
am
i
right
no
you
are
in
what
way
if
you
please
in
this
way
i
don
t
regard
morris
as
an
obstacle
emily
is
too
delicate
and
too
kind
to
hurt
his
feelings
she
is
not
in
love
with
him
there
is
no
absorbing
interest
in
her
mind
to
divert
her
thoughts
from
me
she
is
idle
and
happy
she
thoroughly
enjoys
her
visit
to
this
house
and
i
am
associated
with
her
enjoyment
there
is
my
chance
he
suddenly
stopped
listening
to
him
thus
far
unnaturally
calm
and
cold
francine
now
showed
that
she
felt
the
lash
of
his
contempt
a
hideous
smile
passed
slowly
over
her
white
face
it
threatened
the
vengeance
which
knows
no
fear
no
pity
no
remorse
the
vengeance
of
a
jealous
woman
hysterical
anger
furious
language
mirabel
was
prepared
for
the
smile
frightened
him
well
she
said
scornfully
why
don
t
you
go
on
a
bolder
man
might
still
have
maintained
the
audacious
position
which
he
had
assumed
mirabel
s
faint
heart
shrank
from
it
he
was
eager
to
shelter
himself
under
the
first
excuse
that
he
could
find
his
ingenuity
paralyzed
by
his
fears
was
unable
to
invent
anything
new
he
feebly
availed
himself
of
the
commonplace
trick
of
evasion
which
he
had
read
of
in
novels
and
seen
in
action
on
the
stage
is
it
possible
he
asked
with
an
overacted
assumption
of
surprise
that
you
think
i
am
in
earnest
in
the
case
of
any
other
person
francine
would
have
instantly
seen
through
that
flimsy
pretense
but
the
love
which
accepts
the
meanest
crumbs
of
comfort
that
can
be
thrown
to
it
which
fawns
and
grovels
and
deliberately
deceives
itself
in
its
own
intensely
selfish
interests
was
the
love
that
burned
in
francine
s
breast
the
wretched
girl
believed
mirabel
with
such
an
ecstatic
sense
of
belief
that
she
trembled
in
every
limb
and
dropped
into
the
nearest
chair
was
in
earnest
she
said
faintly
didn
t
you
see
it
he
was
perfectly
shameless
he
denied
that
he
had
seen
it
in
the
most
positive
manner
upon
my
honor
i
thought
you
were
mystifying
me
and
i
humored
the
she
sighed
and
looking
at
him
with
an
expression
of
tender
reproach
i
wonder
whether
i
can
believe
you
she
said
softly
indeed
you
may
believe
me
he
assured
her
she
hesitated
for
the
pleasure
of
hesitating
i
don
t
know
emily
is
very
much
admired
by
some
men
why
not
by
you
for
the
best
of
reasons
he
answered
she
is
poor
and
i
am
poor
those
are
facts
which
speak
for
yes
but
emily
is
bent
on
attracting
you
she
would
marry
you
if
you
asked
her
don
t
attempt
to
deny
it
besides
you
kissed
her
oh
miss
de
sor
don
t
call
me
miss
de
sor
call
me
francine
i
want
to
know
why
you
kissed
her
he
humored
her
with
inexhaustible
servility
allow
me
to
kiss
hand
francine
and
let
me
explain
that
kissing
a
lady
s
hand
is
only
a
form
of
thanking
her
for
her
kindness
you
must
own
that
emily
she
interrupted
him
for
the
third
time
emily
she
repeated
are
you
as
familiar
as
that
already
does
she
call
you
miles
when
you
are
by
yourselves
is
there
any
effort
at
fascination
which
this
charming
creature
has
left
untried
she
told
you
no
doubt
what
a
lonely
life
she
leads
in
her
poor
little
home
even
mirabel
felt
that
he
must
not
permit
this
to
pass
she
has
said
nothing
to
me
about
herself
he
answered
what
i
know
of
her
i
know
from
oh
indeed
you
asked
wyvil
about
her
family
of
course
what
did
he
say
he
said
she
lost
her
mother
when
she
was
a
child
and
he
told
me
her
father
had
died
suddenly
a
few
years
since
of
heart
well
and
what
else
never
mind
now
here
is
somebody
the
person
was
only
one
of
the
servants
mirabel
felt
grateful
to
the
man
for
interrupting
them
animated
by
sentiments
of
a
precisely
opposite
nature
francine
spoke
to
him
sharply
what
do
you
want
here
a
message
from
whom
from
miss
for
me
no
he
turned
to
mirabel
miss
brown
wishes
to
speak
to
you
sir
if
you
are
not
francine
controlled
herself
until
the
man
was
out
of
hearing
upon
my
word
this
is
too
shameless
she
declared
indignantly
emily
can
t
leave
you
with
me
for
five
minutes
without
wanting
to
see
you
again
if
you
go
to
her
after
all
that
you
have
said
to
me
she
cried
threatening
mirabel
with
her
outstretched
hand
you
are
the
meanest
of
men
he
the
meanest
of
men
he
carried
out
his
cowardly
submission
to
the
last
extremity
only
say
what
you
wish
me
to
do
he
replied
even
francine
expected
some
little
resistance
from
a
creature
bearing
the
outward
appearance
of
a
man
oh
do
you
really
mean
it
she
asked
i
want
you
to
disappoint
emily
will
you
stay
here
and
let
me
make
your
excuses
i
will
do
anything
to
please
francine
gave
him
a
farewell
look
her
admiration
made
a
desperate
effort
to
express
itself
appropriately
in
words
you
are
not
a
man
she
said
you
are
an
angel
left
by
himself
mirabel
sat
down
to
rest
he
reviewed
his
own
conduct
with
perfect
complacency
not
one
man
in
a
hundred
could
have
managed
that
as
i
have
done
he
thought
how
shall
i
explain
matters
to
emily
considering
this
question
he
looked
by
chance
at
the
unfinished
crown
of
roses
the
very
thing
to
help
me
he
said
and
took
out
his
pocketbook
and
wrote
these
lines
on
a
blank
page
i
have
had
a
scene
of
jealousy
with
miss
de
sor
which
is
beyond
all
description
to
spare
a
similar
infliction
i
have
done
violence
to
my
own
feelings
instead
of
instantly
obeying
the
message
which
you
have
so
kindly
sent
to
me
i
remain
here
for
a
little
while
entirely
for
your
having
torn
out
the
page
and
twisted
it
up
among
the
roses
so
that
only
a
corner
of
the
paper
appeared
in
view
mirabel
called
to
a
lad
who
was
at
work
in
the
garden
and
gave
him
his
directions
accompanied
by
a
shilling
take
those
flowers
to
the
servants
hall
and
tell
one
of
the
maids
to
put
them
in
miss
brown
s
room
stop
which
is
the
way
to
the
fruit
garden
the
lad
gave
the
necessary
directions
mirabel
walked
away
slowly
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
nerves
had
been
shaken
he
thought
a
little
fruit
might
refresh
him
chapter
xlvii
debating
in
the
meanwhile
emily
had
been
true
to
her
promise
to
relieve
mirabel
s
anxieties
on
the
subject
of
miss
jethro
entering
the
in
search
of
alban
she
found
him
talking
with
cecilia
and
heard
her
own
name
mentioned
as
she
opened
the
door
here
she
is
at
last
cecilia
exclaimed
what
in
the
world
has
kept
you
all
this
time
in
the
rose
garden
has
mirabel
been
more
interesting
than
usual
alban
asked
gayly
whatever
sense
of
annoyance
he
might
have
felt
in
emily
s
absence
was
forgotten
the
moment
she
appeared
all
traces
of
trouble
in
his
face
vanished
when
they
looked
at
each
other
you
shall
judge
for
yourself
emily
replied
with
a
smile
mr
mirabel
has
been
speaking
to
me
of
a
relative
who
is
very
dear
to
him
his
cecilia
was
surprised
why
has
he
never
spoken
to
of
his
sister
she
asked
it
s
a
sad
subject
to
speak
of
my
dear
his
sister
lives
a
life
of
suffering
she
has
been
for
years
a
prisoner
in
her
room
he
writes
to
her
constantly
his
letters
from
monksmoor
have
interested
her
poor
soul
it
seems
he
said
something
about
me
and
she
has
sent
a
kind
message
inviting
me
to
visit
her
one
of
these
days
do
you
understand
it
now
cecilia
of
course
i
do
tell
me
is
mirabel
s
sister
older
or
younger
than
he
is
is
she
married
she
is
a
does
she
live
with
her
brother
alban
asked
oh

has
her
own
house
far
away
in
is
she
near
sir
jervis
redwood
i
fancy
not
her
house

the
any
children
cecilia
inquired
no
she
is
quite
alone
now
cecilia
i
have
told
you
all
i
know
and
i
have
something
to
say
to
morris
no
you
needn
t
leave
us
it
s
a
subject
in
which
you
are
interested
a
subject
she
repeated
turning
to
alban
which
you
may
have
noticed
is
not
very
agreeable
to
miss
jethro
alban
guessed
yes
miss
cecilia
s
curiosity
instantly
asserted
itself
have
tried
to
get
mirabel
to
enlighten
us
and
tried
in
vain
she
said
you
are
a
favorite
have
you
succeeded
i
have
made
no
attempt
to
succeed
emily
replied
my
only
object
is
to
relieve
mirabel
s
anxiety
if
i
can
with
your
help
in
what
way
can
i
help
you
you
mustn
t
be
do
i
look
angry
you
look
serious
it
is
a
very
simple
thing
mirabel
is
afraid
that
miss
jethro
may
have
said
something
disagreeable
about
him
which
you
might
hesitate
to
repeat
is
he
making
himself
uneasy
without
any
reason
without
the
slightest
reason
i
have
concealed
nothing
from
thank
you
for
the
she
turned
to
cecilia
may
i
send
one
of
the
servants
with
a
message
i
may
as
well
put
an
end
to
mirabel
s
the
man
was
summoned
and
was
dispatched
with
the
message
emily
would
have
done
well
after
this
if
she
had
abstained
from
speaking
further
of
miss
jethro
but
mirabel
s
doubts
had
unhappily
inspired
a
similar
feeling
of
uncertainty
in
her
own
mind
she
was
now
disposed
to
attribute
the
tone
of
mystery
in
alban
s
unlucky
letter
to
some
possible
concealment
suggested
by
regard
for
herself
i
wonder
whether
have
any
reason
to
feel
uneasy
she
said
half
in
jest
half
in
earnest
uneasy
about
what
alban
inquired
about
miss
jethro
of
course
has
she
said
anything
of
me
which
your
kindness
has
concealed
alban
seemed
to
be
a
little
hurt
by
the
doubt
which
her
question
implied
was
that
your
motive
he
asked
for
answering
my
letter
as
cautiously
as
if
you
had
been
writing
to
a
stranger
indeed
you
are
quite
wrong
emily
earnestly
assured
him
i
was
perplexed
and
startled
and
i
took
wyvil
s
advice
before
i
wrote
to
you
shall
we
drop
the
subject
alban
would
have
willingly
dropped
the
subject
but
for
that
unfortunate
allusion
to
wyvil
emily
had
unconsciously
touched
him
on
a
sore
place
he
had
already
heard
from
cecilia
of
the
consultation
over
his
letter
and
had
disapproved
of
it
i
think
you
were
wrong
to
trouble
wyvil
he
said
the
altered
tone
of
his
voice
suggested
to
emily
that
he
would
have
spoken
more
severely
if
cecilia
had
not
been
in
the
room
she
thought
him
needlessly
ready
to
complain
of
a
harmless
proceeding
and
she
too
returned
to
the
subject
after
having
proposed
to
drop
it
not
a
minute
since
you
didn
t
tell
me
i
was
to
keep
your
letter
a
secret
she
replied
cecilia
made
matters
worse
with
the
best
intentions
i
m
sure
morris
my
father
was
only
too
glad
to
give
emily
his
alban
remained
silent
ungraciously
silent
as
emily
thought
after
wyvil
s
kindness
to
him
the
thing
to
regret
she
remarked
is
that
morris
allowed
miss
jethro
to
leave
him
without
explaining
herself
in
his
place
i
should
have
insisted
on
knowing
why
she
wanted
to
prevent
me
from
meeting
mirabel
in
this
cecilia
made
another
unlucky
attempt
at
judicious
interference
this
time
she
tried
a
gentle
remonstrance
remember
emily
how
morris
was
situated
he
could
hardly
be
rude
to
a
lady
and
i
daresay
miss
jethro
had
good
reasons
for
not
wishing
to
explain
francine
opened
the
door
and
heard
cecilia
s
last
words
miss
jethro
again
she
exclaimed
where
is
mirabel
emily
asked
i
sent
him
a
he
regrets
to
say
he
is
otherwise
engaged
for
the
present
francine
replied
with
spiteful
politeness
don
t
let
me
interrupt
the
conversation
who
is
this
miss
jethro
whose
name
is
on
everybody
s
lips
alban
could
keep
silent
no
longer
we
have
done
with
the
subject
he
said
sharply
because
i
am
here
because
we
have
said
more
than
enough
about
miss
jethro
speak
for
yourself
morris
emily
answered
resenting
the
masterful
tone
which
alban
s
interference
had
assumed
i
have
not
done
with
miss
jethro
yet
i
can
assure
my
dear
you
don
t
know
where
she
lives
cecilia
reminded
her
leave
me
to
discover
it
emily
answered
hotly
perhaps
mirabel
knows
i
shall
ask
i
thought
you
would
find
a
reason
for
returning
to
mirabel
francine
remarked
before
emily
could
reply
one
of
the
maids
entered
the
room
with
a
wreath
of
roses
in
her
hand
mr
mirabel
sends
you
these
flowers
miss
the
woman
said
addressing
emily
the
boy
told
me
they
were
to
be
taken
to
your
room
i
thought
it
was
a
mistake
and
i
have
brought
them
to
you
francine
who
happened
to
be
nearest
to
the
door
took
the
roses
from
the
girl
on
pretense
of
handing
them
to
emily
her
jealous
vigilance
detected
the
one
visible
morsel
of
mirabel
s
letter
twisted
up
with
the
flowers
had
emily
entrapped
him
into
a
secret
correspondence
with
her
a
scrap
of
waste
paper
among
your
roses
she
said
crumpling
it
up
in
her
hand
as
if
she
meant
to
throw
it
away
but
emily
was
too
quick
for
her
she
caught
francine
by
the
wrist
waste
paper
or
not
she
said
it
was
among
my
flowers
and
it
belongs
to
francine
gave
up
the
letter
with
a
look
which
might
have
startled
emily
if
she
had
noticed
it
she
handed
the
roses
to
cecilia
i
was
making
a
wreath
for
you
to
wear
this
evening
my
dear
and
i
left
it
in
the
garden
it
s
not
quite
finished
cecilia
was
delighted
how
lovely
it
is
she
exclaimed
and
how
very
kind
of
you
i
ll
finish
it
she
turned
away
to
the
conservatory
i
had
no
idea
i
was
interfering
with
a
letter
said
francine
watching
emily
with
eyes
while
she
smoothed
out
the
crumpled
paper
having
read
what
mirabel
had
written
to
her
emily
looked
up
and
saw
that
alban
was
on
the
point
of
following
cecilia
into
the
conservatory
he
had
noticed
something
in
francine
s
face
which
he
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
but
which
made
her
presence
in
the
room
absolutely
hateful
to
him
emily
followed
and
spoke
to
him
i
am
going
back
to
the
rose
garden
she
said
for
any
particular
purpose
alban
inquired
for
a
purpose
which
i
am
afraid
you
won
t
approve
of
i
mean
to
ask
mirabel
if
he
knows
miss
jethro
s
i
hope
he
is
as
ignorant
of
it
as
i
am
alban
answered
gravely
are
we
going
to
quarrel
over
miss
jethro
as
we
once
quarreled
over
rook
emily
asked
with
the
readiest
recovery
of
her
good
humor
come
come
i
am
sure
you
are
as
anxious
in
your
own
private
mind
to
have
this
matter
cleared
up
as
i
with
one
difference
that
i
think
of
consequences
and
you
don
he
said
it
in
his
gentlest
and
kindest
manner
and
stepped
into
the
conservatory
never
mind
the
consequences
she
called
after
him
if
we
can
only
get
at
the
truth
i
hate
being
deceived
there
is
no
person
living
who
has
better
reason
than
you
have
to
say
emily
looked
round
with
a
start
alban
was
out
of
hearing
it
was
francine
who
had
answered
her
what
do
you
mean
she
said
francine
hesitated
a
ghastly
paleness
overspread
her
face
are
you
ill
emily
asked
no
i
am
after
waiting
for
a
moment
in
silence
emily
moved
away
toward
the
door
of
the
francine
suddenly
held
up
her
hand
stop
she
cried
emily
stood
still
my
mind
is
made
up
francine
said
made
up
to
what
you
asked
what
i
meant
just
i
well
my
mind
is
made
up
to
answer
you
miss
emily
brown
you
are
leading
a
sadly
frivolous
life
in
this
house
i
am
going
to
give
you
something
more
serious
to
think
about
than
your
flirtation
with
mirabel
oh
don
t
be
impatient
i
am
coming
to
the
point
without
knowing
it
yourself
you
have
been
the
victim
of
deception
for
years
past
cruel
deception
wicked
deception
that
puts
on
the
mask
of
are
you
alluding
to
miss
jethro
emily
asked
in
astonishment
i
thought
you
were
strangers
to
each
other
just
now
you
wanted
to
know
who
she
i
know
nothing
about
her
i
care
nothing
about
her
i
am
not
thinking
of
miss
who
are
you
thinking
of
i
am
thinking
francine
answered
of
your
dead
chapter
xlviii
investigating
having
revived
his
sinking
energies
in
the
fruit
garden
mirabel
seated
himself
under
the
shade
of
a
tree
and
reflected
on
the
critical
position
in
which
he
was
placed
by
francine
s
jealousy
if
miss
de
sor
continued
to
be
wyvil
s
guest
there
seemed
to
be
no
other
choice
before
mirabel
than
to
leave
monksmoor
and
to
trust
to
a
favorable
reply
to
his
sister
s
invitation
for
the
free
enjoyment
of
emily
s
society
under
another
roof
try
as
he
might
he
could
arrive
at
no
more
satisfactory
conclusion
than
this
in
his
preoccupied
state
time
passed
quickly
nearly
an
hour
had
elapsed
before
he
rose
to
return
to
the
house
entering
the
hall
he
was
startled
by
a
cry
of
terror
in
a
woman
s
voice
coming
from
the
upper
regions
at
the
same
time
wyvil
passing
along
the
bedroom
corridor
after
leaving
the
was
confronted
by
his
daughter
hurrying
out
of
emily
s
bedchamber
in
such
a
state
of
alarm
that
she
could
hardly
speak
gone
she
cried
the
moment
she
saw
her
father
wyvil
took
her
in
his
arms
and
tried
to
compose
her
who
has
gone
he
asked
emily
oh
papa
emily
has
left
us
she
has
heard
dreadful
news
she
told
me
so
what
news
how
did
she
hear
it
i
don
t
know
how
she
heard
it
i
went
back
to
the
to
show
her
my
roses
was
she
alone
yes
she
frightened
me
she
seemed
quite
wild
she
said
let
me
be
by
myself
i
shall
have
to
go
she
kissed
me
and
ran
up
to
her
room
oh
i
am
such
a
fool
anybody
else
would
have
taken
care
not
to
lose
sight
of
how
long
did
you
leave
her
by
herself
i
can
t
say
i
thought
i
would
go
and
tell
you
and
then
i
got
anxious
about
her
and
knocked
at
her
door
and
looked
into
the
room
gone
gone
wyvil
rang
the
bell
and
confided
cecilia
to
the
care
of
her
maid
mirabel
had
already
joined
him
in
the
corridor
they
went
downstairs
together
and
consulted
with
alban
he
volunteered
to
make
immediate
inquiries
at
the
railway
station
wyvil
followed
him
as
far
as
the
lodge
gate
which
opened
on
the
highroad
while
mirabel
went
to
a
second
gate
at
the
opposite
extremity
of
the
park
wyvil
obtained
the
first
news
of
emily
the
lodge
keeper
had
seen
her
pass
him
on
her
way
out
of
the
park
in
the
greatest
haste
he
had
called
after
her
anything
wrong
miss
and
had
received
no
reply
asked
what
time
had
elapsed
since
this
had
happened
he
was
too
confused
to
be
able
to
answer
with
any
certainty
he
knew
that
she
had
taken
the
road
which
led
to
the
station
and
he
knew
no
more
wyvil
and
mirabel
met
again
at
the
house
and
instituted
an
examination
of
the
servants
no
further
discoveries
were
made
the
question
which
occurred
to
everybody
was
suggested
by
the
words
which
cecilia
had
repeated
to
her
father
emily
had
said
she
had
heard
dreadful
news
how
had
that
news
reached
her
the
one
postal
delivery
at
monksmoor
was
in
the
morning
had
any
special
messenger
arrived
with
a
letter
for
emily
the
servants
were
absolutely
certain
that
no
such
person
had
entered
the
house
the
one
remaining
conclusion
suggested
that
somebody
must
have
communicated
the
evil
tidings
by
word
of
mouth
but
here
again
no
evidence
was
to
be
obtained
no
visitor
had
called
during
the
day
and
no
new
guests
had
arrived
investigation
was
completely
baffled
alban
returned
from
the
railway
with
news
of
the
fugitive
he
had
reached
the
station
some
time
after
the
departure
of
the
london
train
the
clerk
at
the
office
recognized
his
description
of
emily
and
stated
that
she
had
taken
her
ticket
for
london
the
had
opened
the
carriage
door
for
her
and
had
noticed
that
the
young
lady
appeared
to
be
very
much
agitated
this
information
obtained
alban
had
dispatched
a
telegram
to
emily
in
cecilia
s
name
pray
send
us
a
few
words
to
relieve
our
anxiety
and
let
us
know
if
we
can
be
of
any
service
to
this
was
plainly
all
that
could
be
done
but
cecilia
was
not
satisfied
if
her
father
had
permitted
it
she
would
have
followed
emily
alban
comforted
her
he
apologized
to
wyvil
for
shortening
his
visit
and
announced
his
intention
of
traveling
to
london
by
the
next
train
we
may
renew
our
inquiries
to
some
advantage
he
added
after
hearing
what
had
happened
in
his
absence
if
we
can
find
out
who
was
the
last
person
who
saw
her
and
spoke
to
her
before
your
daughter
found
her
alone
in
the
when
i
went
out
of
the
room
i
left
her
with
miss
de
the
maid
who
waited
on
miss
de
sor
was
sent
for
francine
had
been
out
by
herself
walking
in
the
park
she
was
then
in
her
room
changing
her
dress
on
hearing
of
emily
s
sudden
departure
she
had
been
as
the
maid
reported
much
shocked
and
quite
at
a
loss
to
understand
what
it
joining
her
friends
a
few
minutes
later
francine
presented
so
far
as
personal
appearance
went
a
strong
contrast
to
the
pale
and
anxious
faces
round
her
she
looked
wonderfully
well
after
her
walk
in
other
respects
she
was
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
prevalent
feeling
she
expressed
herself
with
the
utmost
propriety
her
sympathy
moved
poor
cecilia
to
tears
i
am
sure
miss
de
sor
you
will
try
to
help
us
wyvil
began
with
the
greatest
pleasure
francine
answered
how
long
were
you
and
miss
emily
brown
together
after
morris
left
you
not
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
should
did
anything
remarkable
occur
in
the
course
of
conversation
nothing
alban
interfered
for
the
first
time
did
you
say
anything
he
asked
which
agitated
or
offended
miss
brown
that
s
rather
an
extraordinary
question
francine
remarked
have
you
no
other
answer
to
give
alban
inquired
i
answer
no
she
said
with
a
sudden
outburst
of
anger
there
the
matter
dropped
while
she
spoke
in
reply
to
wyvil
francine
had
confronted
him
without
embarrassment
when
alban
interposed
she
never
looked
at
him
except
when
he
provoked
her
to
anger
did
she
remember
that
the
man
who
was
questioning
her
was
also
the
man
who
had
suspected
her
of
writing
the
anonymous
letter
alban
was
on
his
guard
against
himself
knowing
how
he
disliked
her
but
the
conviction
in
his
own
mind
was
not
to
be
resisted
in
some
unimaginable
way
francine
was
associated
with
emily
s
flight
from
the
house
the
answer
to
the
telegram
sent
from
the
railway
station
had
not
arrived
when
alban
took
his
departure
for
london
cecilia
s
suspense
began
to
grow
unendurable
she
looked
to
mirabel
for
comfort
and
found
none
his
office
was
to
console
and
his
capacity
for
performing
that
office
was
notorious
among
his
admirers
but
he
failed
to
present
himself
to
advantage
when
wyvil
s
lovely
daughter
had
need
of
his
services
he
was
in
truth
too
sincerely
anxious
and
distressed
to
be
capable
of
commanding
his
customary
resources
of
sentiment
and
philosophy
emily
s
influence
had
awakened
the
only
earnest
and
true
feeling
which
had
ever
ennobled
the
popular
preacher
s
life
toward
evening
the
telegram
was
received
at
last
what
could
be
said
under
the
circumstances
it
said
in
these
words
safe
at

the
cheering
influence
of
a
cup
of
tea
when
she
heard
a
cab
draw
up
at
the
cottage
gate
a
violent
ring
at
the
bell
followed
she
opened
the
door
and
found
emily
on
the
steps
one
look
at
that
dear
and
familiar
face
was
enough
for
the
old
servant
god
help
us
she
cried
what
s
wrong
now
without
a
word
of
reply
emily
led
the
way
into
the
bedchamber
which
had
been
the
scene
of
miss
letitia
s
death
ellmother
hesitated
on
the
threshold
why
do
you
bring
me
in
here
she
asked
why
did
you
try
to
keep
me
out
emily
answered

to
keep
you
out

when
i
came
home
from
school

nurse
my
aunt

old
mistress

aunt
deceived
me
about
my
father
s
death
and
that
you
knew
it
there
was
dead
silence
ellmother
trembled
horribly
her
lips
dropped
apart
her
eyes
wandered
round
the
room
with
a
stare
of
idiotic
terror
is
it
her
ghost
tells
you
that
she
whispered
where
is
her
ghost
the
room
whirls
round
and
round
miss
and
the
air
sings
in
my
emily
sprang
forward
to
support
her
she
staggered
to
a
chair
and
lifted
her
great
bony
hands
in
wild
entreaty
don
t
frighten
me
she
said
stand
emily
obeyed
her
she
dashed
the
cold
sweat
off
her
forehead
you
were
talking
about
your
father
s
death
just
now
she
burst
out
in
desperate
defiant
tones

know
it
and
we
are
sorry
for
it

father

father

in
the
inn
at
zeeland
all
the
long
way
to
london
i
have
tried
to
doubt
it
oh
me
i
know
it
now
answering
in
those
words
she
looked
toward
the
bed
harrowing
remembrances
of
her
aunt
s
delirious
made
the
room
unendurable
to
her
she
ran
out
the
parlor
door
was
open
entering
the
room
she
passed
by
a
portrait
of
her
father
which
her
aunt
had
hung
on
the
wall
over
the
fireplace
she
threw
herself
on
the
sofa
and
burst
into
a
passionate
fit
of
crying
oh
my
father
my
dear
gentle
loving
father
my
first
best
truest
friend
murdered

oh
god
where
was
your
justice

your
mercy

death

hand
was
laid
on
her
shoulder

voice
said
to
her

child

looked
up
and
saw
that
ellmother
had
followed
her

stopped
and

to
shudder
again

you
something

asked
i
warned
my
mistress
standing
by
your
father

truth

time

to

how
you
found
it
out
was
it
by
accident
my
dear
or
did
a
person
tell
you
emily
s
mind
was
far
away
from
ellmother
she
rose
from
the
sofa
with
her
hands
held
fast
over
her
aching
heart
the
one
duty
of
my
life
she
said
i
am
thinking
of
the
one
duty
of
my
life
look
i
am
calm
now
i
am
resigned
to
my
hard
lot
never
never
again
can
the
dear
memory
of
my
father
be
what
it
was
from
this
time

is
the
horrid
memory
of
a
crime
the
crime
has
gone
unpunished
the
man
has
escaped
others
he
shall
not
escape
she
paused
and
looked
at
ellmother
absently
what
did
you
say
just
now
you
want
to
hear
how
i
know
what
i
know
naturally
naturally
sit
down
here
sit
down
my
old
friend
on
the
sofa
with
me
and
take
your
mind
back
to
netherwoods
alban
morris
ellmother
recoiled
from
emily
in
dismay
don
t
tell
me
had
anything
to
do
with
it
the
kindest
of
men
the
best
of
men
the
man
of
all
men
living
who
least
deserves
your
good
opinion
or
mine
emily
answered
sternly
you
ellmother
exclaimed
say
that
i
say
it
he
who
won
on
me
to
like
him
he
was
in
the
conspiracy
to
deceive
me
and
you
know
it
he
heard
me
talk
of
the
newspaper
story
of
the
murder
of
my
father
i
say
he
heard
me
talk
of
it
composedly
talk
of
it
carelessly
in
the
innocent
belief
that
it
was
the
murder
of
a
stranger
and
he
never
opened
his
lips
to
prevent
that
horrid
profanation
he
never
even
said
speak
of
something
else
i
won
t
hear
you
no
more
of
him
god
forbid
i
should
ever
see
him
again
no
do
what
i
told
you
carry
your
mind
back
to
netherwoods
one
night
you
let
francine
de
sor
frighten
you
you
ran
away
from
her
into
the
garden
keep
quiet
at
your
age
must
i
set
you
an
example
of
i
want
to
know
miss
emily
where
francine
de
sor
is
now
she
is
at
the
house
in
the
country
which
i
have
where
does
she
go
next
if
you
please
back
to
miss
ladd
i
suppose
so
what
interest
have
you
in
knowing
where
she
goes
next
i
won
t
interrupt
you
miss
it
s
true
that
i
ran
away
into
the
garden
i
can
guess
who
followed
me
how
did
she
find
her
way
to
me
and
morris
in
the
dark
the
smell
of
tobacco
guided
her
she
knew
who
smoked
she
had
seen
him
talking
to
you
on
that
very
day
she
followed
the
scent
she
heard
what
you
two
said
to
each
other
and
she
has
repeated
it
to
me
oh
my
old
friend
the
malice
of
a
revengeful
girl
has
enlightened
me
when
you
my
nurse
and
he
my
lover
left
me
in
the
dark
it
has
told
me
how
my
father
died
that
s
said
bitterly
miss
is
it
said
truly
no
it
isn
t
said
truly
of
myself
god
knows
you
would
never
have
been
kept
in
the
dark
if
your
aunt
had
listened
to
me
i
begged
and
prayed
i
went
down
on
my
knees
to
her
i
warned
her
as
i
told
you
just
now
must
i
tell
what
a
headstrong
woman
miss
letitia
was
she
insisted
she
put
the
choice
before
me
of
leaving
her
at
once
and
forever
or
giving
in
i
wouldn
t
have
given
in
to
any
other
creature
on
the
face
of
this
earth
i
am
obstinate
as
you
have
often
told
me
well
your
aunt
s
obstinacy
beat
mine
i
was
too
fond
of
her
to
say
no
besides
if
you
ask
me
who
was
to
blame
in
the
first
place
i
tell
you
it
wasn
t
your
aunt
she
was
frightened
into
who
frightened
her
your
godfather
the
great
london
surgeon
he
who
was
visiting
in
our
house
at
the
sir
richard
yes
sir
richard
he
said
he
wouldn
t
answer
for
the
consequences
in
the
delicate
state
of
your
health
if
we
told
you
the
truth
ah
he
had
it
all
his
own
way
after
that
he
went
with
miss
letitia
to
the
inquest
he
won
over
the
coroner
and
the
newspaper
men
to
his
will
he
kept
your
aunt
s
name
out
of
the
papers
he
took
charge
of
the
coffin
he
hired
the
undertaker
and
his
men
strangers
from
london
he
wrote
the
certificate
who
but
he
everybody
was
cap
in
hand
to
the
famous
man
surely
the
servants
and
the
neighbors
asked
questions
hundreds
of
questions
what
did
that
matter
to
sir
richard
they
were
like
so
many
children
in
hands
and
mind
you
the
luck
helped
him
to
begin
with
there
was
the
common
name
who
was
to
pick
out
your
poor
father
among
the
thousands
of
james
browns
then
again
the
house
and
lands
went
to
the
male
heir
as
they
called
him
the
man
your
father
quarreled
with
in
the
bygone
time
he
brought
his
own
establishment
with
him
long
before
you
got
back
from
the
friends
you
were
staying
with
don
t
you
remember
it
we
had
cleared
out
of
the
house
we
were
miles
and
miles
away
and
the
old
servants
were
scattered
abroad
finding
new
situations
wherever
they
could
how
could
you
suspect
us
we
had
nothing
to
fear
in
that
way
but
my
conscience
pricked
me
i
made
another
attempt
to
prevail
on
miss
letitia
when
you
had
recovered
your
health
i
said
there
s
no
fear
of
a
relapse
now
break
it
to
her
gently
but
tell
her
the
no
your
aunt
was
too
fond
of
you
she
daunted
me
with
dreadful
fits
of
crying
when
i
tried
to
persuade
her
and
that
wasn
t
the
worst
of
it
she
bade
me
remember
what
an
excitable
man
your
father
was
she
reminded
me
that
the
misery
of
your
mother
s
death
laid
him
low
with
brain
fever
she
said
emily
takes
after
her
father
i
have
heard
you
say
it
yourself
she
has
his
constitution
and
his
sensitive
nerves
don
t
you
know
how
she
loved
him
how
she
talks
of
him
to
this
day
who
can
tell
if
we
are
not
careful
what
dreadful
mischief
we
may
do
that
was
how
my
mistress
worked
on
me
i
got
infected
with
her
fears
it
was
as
if
i
had
caught
an
infection
of
disease
oh
my
dear
blame
me
if
it
must
be
but
don
t
forget
how
i
have
suffered
for
it
since
i
was
driven
away
from
my
dying
mistress
in
terror
of
what
she
might
say
while
you
were
watching
at
her
bedside
i
have
lived
in
fear
of
what
you
might
ask
me
and
have
longed
to
go
back
to
you
and
have
not
had
the
courage
to
do
it
look
at
me
now
the
poor
woman
tried
to
take
out
her
handkerchief
her
quivering
hand
helplessly
entangled
itself
in
her
dress
i
can
t
even
dry
my
eyes
she
said
faintly
try
to
forgive
me
miss
emily
put
her
arms
round
the
old
nurse
s
neck
it
is
she
said
sadly
who
must
forgive
for
a
while
they
were
silent
through
the
window
that
was
open
to
the
little
garden
came
the
one
sound
that
could
be
heard
the
gentle
trembling
of
leaves
in
the
evening
wind
the
silence
was
harshly
broken
by
the
bell
at
the
cottage
door
they
both
started
emily
s
heart
beat
fast
who
can
it
be
she
said
ellmother
rose
shall
i
say
you
can
t
see
anybody
she
asked
before
leaving
the
room
yes
yes
emily
heard
the
door
opened
heard
low
voices
in
the
passage
there
was
a
momentary
interval
then
ellmother
returned
she
said
nothing
emily
spoke
to
her
is
it
a
visitor
have
you
said
i
can
t
see
anybody
i
couldn
t
say
why
not
don
t
be
hard
on
him
my
dear
it
s
alban
chapter
miss
ladd
advises
ellmother
sat
by
the
dying
embers
of
the
kitchen
fire
thinking
over
the
events
of
the
day
in
perplexity
and
distress
she
had
waited
at
the
cottage
door
for
a
friendly
word
with
alban
after
he
had
left
emily
the
stern
despair
in
his
face
warned
her
to
let
him
go
in
silence
she
had
looked
into
the
parlor
next
pale
and
cold
emily
lay
on
the
sofa
sunk
in
helpless
depression
of
body
and
mind
don
t
speak
to
me
she
whispered
i
am
quite
worn
it
was
but
too
plain
that
the
view
of
alban
s
conduct
which
she
had
already
expressed
was
the
view
to
which
she
had
adhered
at
the
interview
between
them
they
had
parted
in
grief
in
anger
perhaps
forever
ellmother
lifted
emily
in
compassionate
silence
and
carried
her
upstairs
and
waited
by
her
until
she
slept
in
the
still
hours
of
the
night
the
thoughts
of
the
faithful
old
servant
dwelling
for
a
while
on
past
and
present
advanced
by
slow
degrees
to
consideration
of
the
doubtful
future
measuring
to
the
best
of
her
ability
the
responsibility
which
had
fallen
on
her
she
felt
that
it
was
more
than
she
could
bear
or
ought
to
bear
alone
to
whom
could
she
look
for
help
the
gentlefolks
at
monksmoor
were
strangers
to
her
doctor
allday
was
near
at
hand
but
emily
had
said
don
t
send
for
him
he
will
torment
me
with
questions
and
i
want
to
keep
my
mind
quiet
if
i
but
one
person
was
left
to
whose
kindness
ellmother
could
appeal
and
that
person
was
miss
ladd
it
would
have
been
easy
to
ask
the
help
of
the
good
schoolmistress
in
comforting
and
advising
the
favorite
pupil
whom
she
loved
but
ellmother
had
another
object
in
view
she
was
determined
that
the
cruelty
of
emily
s
treacherous
friend
should
not
be
allowed
to
triumph
with
impunity
if
an
ignorant
old
woman
could
do
nothing
else
she
could
tell
the
plain
truth
and
could
leave
miss
ladd
to
decide
whether
such
a
person
as
francine
deserved
to
remain
under
her
care
to
feel
justified
in
taking
this
step
was
one
thing
to
put
it
all
clearly
in
writing
was
another
after
vainly
making
the
attempt
overnight
ellmother
tore
up
her
letter
and
communicated
with
miss
ladd
by
means
of
a
telegraphic
message
in
the
morning
miss
emily
is
in
great
distress
i
must
not
leave
her
i
have
something
besides
to
say
to
you
which
can
not
be
put
into
a
letter

you
please
come
to
us
later
in
the
forenoon
ellmother
was
called
to
the
door
by
the
arrival
of
a
visitor
the
personal
appearance
of
the
stranger
impressed
her
favorably
he

a
handsome
little
gentleman

poorly

sincere
sympathy
and
regret
that

was
interested
in
him
she
added
a
word
more

mistress

arrived
at
the
cottage
was
the
trusty
friend
in
whose
generous
nature
ellmother
had
wisely
placed
confidence
miss
ladd
had
resolved
to
answer
the
telegram
in
person
the
moment
she
read
it
if
there
is
bad
news
she
said
let
me
hear
it
at
once
i
am
not
well
enough
to
bear
suspense
my
busy
life
at
the
school
is
beginning
to
tell
on
there
is
nothing
that
need
alarm
you
ma
am
but
there
is
a
great
deal
to
say
before
you
see
miss
emily
my
stupid
head
turns
giddy
with
thinking
of
it
i
hardly
know
where
to
begin
with
emily
miss
ladd
suggested
ellmother
took
the
advice
she
described
emily
s
unexpected
arrival
on
the
previous
day
and
she
repeated
what
had
passed
between
them
afterward
miss
ladd
s
first
impulse
when
she
had
recovered
her
composure
was
to
go
to
emily
without
waiting
to
hear
more
not
presuming
to
stop
her
ellmother
ventured
to
put
a
question
do
you
happen
to
have
my
telegram
about
you
ma
am
miss
ladd
produced
it
will
you
please
look
at
the
last
part
of
it
again
miss
ladd
read
the
words
i
have
something
besides
to
say
to
you
which
can
not
be
put
into
a
she
at
once
returned
to
her
chair
does
what
you
have
still
to
tell
me
refer
to
any
person
whom
i
know
she
said
it
refers
ma
am
to
miss
de
sor
i
am
afraid
i
shall
distress
what
did
i
say
when
i
came
in
miss
ladd
asked
speak
out
plainly
and
try
it
s
not
easy
i
know
but
try
to
begin
at
the
ellmother
looked
back
through
her
memory
of
past
events
and
began
by
alluding
to
the
feeling
of
curiosity
which
she
had
excited
in
francine
on
the
day
when
emily
had
made
them
known
to
one
another
from
this
she
advanced
to
the
narrative
of
what
had
taken
place
at
netherwoods
to
the
atrocious
attempt
to
frighten
her
by
means
of
the
image
of
wax
to
the
discovery
made
by
francine
in
the
garden
at
night
and
to
the
circumstances
under
which
that
discovery
had
been
communicated
to
emily
miss
ladd
s
face
reddened
with
indignation
are
you
sure
of
all
that
you
have
said
she
asked
i
am
quite
sure
ma
am
i
hope
i
have
not
done
wrong
ellmother
added
simply
in
telling
you
all
this
wrong
miss
ladd
repeated
warmly
if
that
wretched
girl
has
no
defense
to
offer
she
is
a
disgrace
to
my
school
and
i
owe
you
a
debt
of
gratitude
for
showing
her
to
me
in
her
true
character
she
shall
return
at
once
to
netherwoods
and
she
shall
answer
me
to
my
entire
satisfaction
or
leave
my
house
what
cruelty
what
duplicity
in
all
my
experience
of
girls
i
have
never
met
with
the
like
of
it
let
me
go
to
my
dear
little
emily
and
try
to
forget
what
i
have
ellmother
led
the
good
lady
to
emily
s
room
and
returning
to
the
lower
part
of
the
house
went
out
into
the
garden
the
mental
effort
that
she
had
made
had
left
its
result
in
an
aching
head
and
in
an
overpowering
sense
of
depression
a
mouthful
of
fresh
air
will
revive
me
she
thought
the
front
garden
and
back
garden
at
the
cottage
communicated
with
each
other
walking
slowly
round
and
round
ellmother
heard
footsteps
on
the
road
outside
which
stopped
at
the
gate
she
looked
through
the
grating
and
discovered
alban
morris
come
in
sir
she
said
rejoiced
to
see
him
he
obeyed
in
silence
the
full
view
of
his
face
shocked
ellmother
never
in
her
experience
of
the
friend
who
had
been
so
kind
to
her
at
netherwoods
had
he
looked
so
old
and
so
haggard
as
he
looked
now

she
has
distressed

me
to
bear
my
misfortune
as
becomes
a
man
i
have
had
some
hard
blows
in
my
time
they
don
t
seem
to

blunted
my
sense
of
feeling
as
i
thought
they
had
thank

she
has
made

good
man
ellmother
thought
on

house

is
what
i
have
never
believed
her
to
be
yet
she
s
a
in
half
an
hour
more
miss
ladd
joined
alban
on
the
little
plot
of
grass
behind
the
cottage
i
bring
emily
s
reply
to
your
letter
she
said
read
it
before
you
speak
to
alban
read
it
don
t
suppose
you
have
offended
me
and
be
assured
that
i
feel
gratefully
the
tone
in
which
your
note
is
written
i
try
to
write
forbearingly
on
my
side
i
wish
i
could
write
acceptably
as
well
it
is
not
to
be
done
i
am
as
unable
as
ever
to
enter
into
your
motives
you
are
not
my
relation
you
were
under
no
obligation
of
secrecy
you
heard
me
speak
ignorantly
of
the
murder
of
my
father
as
if
it
had
been
the
murder
of
a
stranger
and
yet
you
kept
me
deliberately
cruelly
kept
me
deceived
the
remembrance
of
it
burns
me
like
fire
i
can
not
oh
alban
i
can
not
restore
you
to
the
place
in
my
estimation
which
you
have
lost
if
you
wish
to
help
me
to
bear
my
trouble
i
entreat
you
not
to
write
to
me
alban
offered
the
letter
silently
to
miss
ladd
she
signed
to
him
to
keep
it
i
know
what
emily
has
written
she
said
and
i
have
told
her
what
i
now
tell
you
she
is
wrong
in
every
way
wrong
it
is
the
misfortune
of
her
impetuous
nature
that
she
rushes
to
conclusions
and
those
conclusions
once
formed
she
holds
to
them
with
all
the
strength
of
her
character
in
this
matter
she
has
looked
at
her
side
of
the
question
exclusively
she
is
blind
to
your
not
willfully
alban
interposed
miss
ladd
looked
at
him
with
admiration
you
defend
emily
she
said
i
love
her
alban
answered
miss
ladd
felt
for
him
as
ellmother
had
felt
for
him
trust
to
time
morris
she
resumed
the
danger
to
be
afraid
of
is
the
danger
of
some
headlong
action
on
her
part
in
the
interval
who
can
say
what
the
end
may
be
if
she
persists
in
her
present
way
of
thinking
there
is
something
monstrous
in
a
young
girl
declaring
that
it
is
duty
to
pursue
a
murderer
and
to
bring
him
to
justice
don
t
you
see
it
yourself
alban
still
defended
emily
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
natural
impulse
he
said
natural
and
noble
miss
ladd
exclaimed
yes
for
it
grows
out
of
the
love
which
has
not
died
with
her
father
s
then
you
encourage
her
with
my
whole
heart
if
she
would
give
me
the
opportunity
we
won
t
pursue
the
subject
morris
i
am
told
by
ellmother
that
you
have
something
to
say
to
me
what
is
it
i
have
to
ask
you
alban
replied
to
let
me
resign
my
situation
at
miss
ladd
was
not
only
surprised
she
was
also
a
very
rare
thing
with
her
inclined
to
be
suspicious
after
what
he
had
said
to
emily
it
occurred
to
her
that
alban
might
be
meditating
some
desperate
project
with
the
hope
of
recovering
his
lost
place
in
her
favor
have
you
heard
of
some
better
employment
she
asked
i
have
heard
of
no
employment
my
mind
is
not
in
a
state
to
give
the
necessary
attention
to
my
is
that
your
only
reason
for
wishing
to
leave
me
it
is
one
of
my
the
only
one
which
you
think
it
necessary
to
mention
i
shall
be
sorry
to
lose
you
believe
me
miss
ladd
i
am
not
ungrateful
for
your
will
you
let
me
in
all
kindness
say
something
more
miss
ladd
answered
i
don
t
intrude
on
your
secrets
i
only
hope
that
you
have
no
rash
project
in
i
don
t
understand
you
miss
yes
morris
you
she
shook
hands
with
him
and
went
back
to
emily
chapter
li
the
doctor
sees
alban
returned
to
netherwoods
to
continue
his
services
until
another
master
could
be
found
to
take
his
place
by
a
later
train
miss
ladd
followed
him
emily
was
too
well
aware
of
the
importance
of
the
mistress
s
presence
to
the
of
the
school
to
permit
her
to
remain
at
the
cottage
it
was
understood
that
they
were
to
correspond
and
that
emily
s
room
was
waiting
for
her
at
netherwoods
whenever
she
felt
inclined
to
occupy
it
ellmother
made
the
tea
that
evening
earlier
than
usual
being
alone
again
with
emily
it
struck
her
that
she
might
take
advantage
of
her
position
to
say
a
word
in
alban
s
favor
she
had
chosen
her
time
unfortunately
the
moment
she
pronounced
the
name
emily
checked
her
by
a
look
and
spoke
of
another
person
that
person
being
miss
jethro
ellmother
at
once
entered
her
protest
in
her
own
downright
way
whatever
you
do
she
said
don
t
go
back
to
that
what
does
miss
jethro
matter
to
you
i
am
more
interested
in
her
than
you
suppose
i
happen
to
know
why
she
left
the
begging
your
pardon
miss
that
s
quite
impossible
she
left
the
school
emily
persisted
for
a
serious
reason
miss
ladd
discovered
that
she
had
used
false
good
lord
who
told
you
that
you
see
i
know
it
i
asked
miss
ladd
how
she
got
her
information
she
was
bound
by
a
promise
never
to
mention
the
person
s
name
i
didn
t
say
it
to
her
but
i
may
say
it
to
you
i
am
afraid
i
have
an
idea
of
who
the
person
no
ellmother
obstinately
asserted
you
can
t
possibly
know
who
it
was
how
should
you
know
do
you
wish
me
to
repeat
what
i
heard
in
that
room
opposite
when
my
aunt
was
dying
drop
it
miss
emily
for
god
s
sake
drop
it
i
can
t
drop
it
it
s
dreadful
to
me
to
have
suspicions
of
my
aunt
and
no
better
reason
for
them
than
what
she
said
in
a
state
of
delirium
tell
me
if
you
love
me
was
it
her
wandering
fancy
or
was
it
the
truth
as
i
hope
to
be
saved
miss
emily
i
can
only
guess
as
you
do
i
don
t
rightly
know
my
mistress
trusted
me
half
way
as
it
were
i
m
afraid
i
have
a
rough
tongue
of
my
own
sometimes
i
offended
her
and
from
that
time
she
kept
her
own
counsel
what
she
did
she
did
in
the
dark
so
far
as
i
was
how
did
you
offend
her
i
shall
be
obliged
to
speak
of
your
father
if
i
tell
you
how
speak
of
was
not
to
blame
mind
that
ellmother
said
earnestly
if
i
wasn
t
certain
of
what
i
say
now
you
wouldn
t
get
a
word
out
of
me
good
harmless
man
there
s
no
denying
it
he
in
love
with
miss
jethro
what
s
the
matter
emily
was
thinking
of
her
memorable
conversation
with
the
disgraced
teacher
on
her
last
night
at
school
nothing
she
answered
go
if
he
had
not
tried
to
keep
it
secret
from
us
ellmother
resumed
your
aunt
might
never
have
taken
it
into
her
head
that
he
was
entangled
in
a
love
affair
of
the
shameful
sort
i
don
t
deny
that
i
helped
her
in
her
inquiries
but
it
was
only
because
i
felt
sure
from
the
first
that
the
more
she
discovered
the
more
certainly
my
master
s
innocence
would
show
itself
he
used
to
go
away
and
visit
miss
jethro
privately
in
the
time
when
your
aunt
trusted
me
we
never
could
find
out
where
she
made
that
discovery
afterward
for
herself
i
can
t
tell
you
how
long
afterward
and
she
spent
money
in
employing
mean
wretches
to
pry
into
miss
jethro
s
past
life
she
had
if
you
will
excuse
me
for
saying
it
an
old
maid
s
hatred
of
the
handsome
young
woman
who
lured
your
father
away
from
home
and
set
up
a
secret
in
a
manner
of
speaking
between
her
brother
and
herself
i
won
t
tell
you
how
we
looked
at
letters
and
other
things
which
he
forgot
to
leave
under
lock
and
key
i
will
only
say
there
was
one
bit
in
a
journal
he
kept
which
made
me
ashamed
of
myself
i
read
it
out
to
miss
letitia
and
i
told
her
in
so
many
words
not
to
count
any
more
on
me
no
i
haven
t
got
a
copy
of
the
words
i
can
remember
them
without
a
copy
even
if
my
religion
did
not
forbid
me
to
peril
my
soul
by
leading
a
life
of
sin
with
this
woman
whom
i
love
that
was
how
it
began
the
thought
of
my
daughter
would
keep
me
pure
no
conduct
of
mine
shall
ever
make
me
unworthy
of
my
child
s
affection
and
there
i
m
making
you
cry
i
won
t
stay
here
any
longer
all
that
i
had
to
say
has
been
said
nobody
but
miss
ladd
knows
for
certain
whether
your
aunt
was
innocent
or
guilty
in
the
matter
of
miss
jethro
s
disgrace
please
to
excuse
me
my
work
s
waiting
from
time
to
time
as
she
pursued
her
domestic
labors
ellmother
thought
of
mirabel
hours
on
hours
had
passed
and
the
doctor
had
not
appeared
was
he
too
busy
to
spare
even
a
few
minutes
of
his
time
or
had
the
handsome
little
gentleman
after
promising
so
fairly
failed
to
perform
his
errand
this
last
doubt
wronged
mirabel
he
had
engaged
to
return
to
the
doctor
s
house
and
he
kept
his
word
doctor
allday
was
at
home
again
and
was
seeing
patients
introduced
in
his
turn
mirabel
had
no
reason
to
complain
of
his
reception
at
the
same
time
after
he
had
stated
the
object
of
his
visit
something
odd
began
to
show
itself
in
the
doctor
s
manner
he
looked
at
mirabel
with
an
appearance
of
uneasy
curiosity
and
he
contrived
an
excuse
for
altering
the
visitor
s
position
in
the
room
so
that
the
light
fell
full
on
mirabel
s
face
i
fancy
i
must
have
seen
you
the
doctor
said
at
some
former
i
am
ashamed
to
say
i
don
t
remember
it
mirabel
answered
ah
very
likely
i
m
wrong
i
ll
call
on
miss
emily
sir
you
may
depend
on
left
in
his
doctor
allday
failed
to
ring
the
bell
which
summoned
the
next
patient
who
was
waiting
for
him
he
took
his
diary
from
the
table
drawer
and
turned
to
the
daily
entries
for
the
past
month
of
july
arriving
at
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
month
he
glanced
at
the
first
lines
of
writing
a
visit
from
a
mysterious
lady
calling
herself
miss
jethro
our
conference
led
to
some
very
unexpected
no
that
was
not
what
he
was
in
search
of
he
looked
a
little
lower
down
and
read
on
regularly
from
that
point
as
follows
called
on
miss
emily
in
great
anxiety
about
the
discoveries
which
she
might
make
among
her

a
reward
for
discovery
of
the
murderer
which
she
found
in

gave
her
back
the
handbill
emily
much
surprised
that
the
wretch
should
have
escaped
with
such
a
careful
description
of
him
circulated
everywhere
she
read
the
description
aloud
to
me
in
her
nice
clear
voice
supposed
age
between
and
thirty
years
a
man
of
small
stature
fai
r
complexion
delicate
features
clear
blue
eyes
hair
light
and
cut
rather
short
clean
shaven
with
the
exception
of
narrow
and
so
on
emily
at
a
loss
to
understand
how
the
fugitive
could
disguise
himself
reminded
her
that
he
could
effectually
disguise
his
head
and
face
with
time
to
help
him
by
letting
his
hair
grow
long
and
cultivating
his
beard
emily
not
convinced
even
by
this
view
of
the
case
changed
the
the
doctor
put
away
his
diary
and
rang
the
bell
curious
he
thought
that
dandified
little
clergyman
has
certainly
reminded
me
of
my
discussion
with
emily
more
than
two
months
since
was
it
his
flowing
hair
i
wonder
or
his
splendid
beard
good
god
suppose
it
should
turn
out
he
was
interrupted
by
the
appearance
of
his
patient
other
ailing
people
followed
doctor
allday
s
mind
was
professionally
occupied
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
chapter
lii
if
i
could
find
a
friend
shortly
after
miss
ladd
had
taken
her
departure
a
parcel
arrived
for
emily
bearing
the
name
of
a
bookseller
printed
on
the
label
it
was
large
and
it
was
heavy
reading
enough
i
should
think
to
last
for
a
lifetime
ellmother
remarked
after
carrying
the
parcel
upstairs
emily
called
her
back
as
she
was
leaving
the
room
i
want
to
caution
you
she
said
before
miss
wyvil
comes
don
t
tell
her
don
t
tell
anybody
how
my
father
met
his
death
if
other
persons
are
taken
into
our
confidence
they
will
talk
of
it
we
don
t
know
how
near
to
us
the
murderer
may
be
the
slightest
hint
may
put
him
on
his
oh
miss
are
you
still
thinking
of
that
i
think
of
nothing
bad
for
your
mind
miss
emily
and
bad
for
your
body
as
your
looks
show
i
wish
you
would
take
counsel
with
some
discreet
person
before
you
move
in
this
matter
by
emily
sighed
wearily
in
my
situation
where
is
the
person
whom
i
can
trust
you
can
trust
the
good
can
i
perhaps
i
was
wrong
when
i
told
you
i
wouldn
t
see
him
he
might
be
of
some
use
to
ellmother
made
the
most
of
this
concession
in
the
fear
that
emily
might
change
her
mind
doctor
allday
may
call
on
you
tomorrow
she
said
do
you
mean
that
you
have
sent
for
him
don
t
be
angry
i
did
it
for
the
best
and
mirabel
agreed
with
mr
mirabel
what
have
you
told
mirabel
nothing
except
that
you
are
ill
when
he
heard
that
he
proposed
to
go
for
the
doctor
he
will
be
here
again
to
ask
for
news
of
your
health
will
you
see
him
i
don
t
know
yet
i
have
other
things
to
think
of
bring
miss
wyvil
up
here
when
she
am
i
to
get
the
spare
room
ready
for
her
no
she
is
staying
with
her
father
at
the
london
emily
made
that
reply
almost
with
an
air
of
relief
when
cecilia
arrived
it
was
only
by
an
effort
that
she
could
show
grateful
appreciation
of
the
sympathy
of
her
dearest
friend
when
the
visit
came
to
an
end
she
felt
an
ungrateful
sense
of
freedom
the
restraint
was
off
her
mind
she
could
think
again
of
the
one
terrible
subject
that
had
any
interest
for
her
now
over
love
over
friendship
over
the
natural
enjoyment
of
her
young
life
predominated
the
blighting
resolution
which
bound
her
to
avenge
her
father
s
death
her
dearest
remembrances
of
him
tender
remembrances
once
now
burned
in
her
to
use
her
own
words
like
fire
it
was
no
ordinary
love
that
had
bound
parent
and
child
together
in
the
bygone
time
emily
had
grown
from
infancy
to
girlhood
owing
all
the
brightness
of
her
life
a
life
without
a
mother
without
brothers
without
sisters
to
her
father
alone
to
submit
to
lose
this
beloved
this
only
companion
by
the
cruel
stroke
of
disease
was
of
all
trials
of
resignation
the
hardest
to
bear
but
to
be
severed
from
him
by
the
murderous
hand
of
a
man
was
more
than
emily
s
fervent
nature
could
passively
endure
before
the
garden
gate
had
closed
on
her
friend
she
had
returned
to
her
one
thought
she
was
breathing
again
her
one
aspiration
the
books
that
she
had
ordered
with
her
own
purpose
in
view
books
that
might
supply
her
want
of
experience
and
might
reveal
the
perils
which
beset
the
course
that
lay
before
her
were
unpacked
and
spread
out
on
the
table
hour
after
hour
when
the
old
servant
believed
that
her
mistress
was
in
bed
she
was
absorbed
over
biographies
in
english
and
french
which
related
the
stratagems
by
means
of
which
famous
policemen
had
captured
the
worst
criminals
of
their
time
from
these
she
turned
to
works
of
fiction
which
found
their
chief
topic
of
interest
in
dwelling
on
the
discovery
of
hidden
crime
the
night
passed
and
dawn
glimmered
through
the
window
and
still
she
opened
book
after
book
with
sinking
courage
and
still
she
gained
nothing
but
the
disheartening
conviction
of
her
inability
to
carry
out
her
own
plans
almost
every
page
that
she
turned
over
revealed
the
immovable
obstacles
set
in
her
way
by
her
sex
and
her
age
could
mix
with
the
people
or
visit
the
scenes
familiar
to
the
experience
of
men
in
fact
and
in
fiction
who
had
traced
the
homicide
to
his
and
had
marked
him
among
his
harmless
with
the
brand
of
cain
no
a
young
girl
following
or
attempting
to
follow
that
career
must
reckon
with
insult
and
outrage
paying
their
abominable
tribute
to
her
youth
and
her
beauty
at
every
turn
what
proportion
would
the
men
who
might
respect
her
bear
to
the
men
who
might
make
her
the
object
of
advances
which
it
was
hardly
possible
to
imagine
without
shuddering
she
crept
exhausted
to
her
bed
the
most
helpless
hopeless
creature
on
the
wide
surface
of
the
earth
a
girl
to
the
task
of
a
man
careful
to
perform
his
promise
to
mirabel
without
delay
the
doctor
called
on
emily
early
in
the
morning
before
the
hour
at
which
he
usually
entered
his
well
what
s
the
matter
with
the
pretty
young
mistress
he
asked
in
his
most
abrupt
manner
when
ellmother
opened
the
door
is
it
love
or
jealousy
or
a
new
dress
with
a
wrinkle
in
it
you
will
hear
about
it
sir
from
miss
emily
herself
i
am
forbidden
to
say
but
you
mean
to
say
something
for
all
that
don
t
joke
doctor
allday
the
state
of
things
here
is
a
great
deal
too
serious
for
joking
make
up
your
mind
to
be
surprised
i
say
no
before
the
doctor
could
ask
what
this
meant
emily
opened
the
parlor
door
come
in
she
said
impatiently
doctor
allday
s
first
greeting
was
strictly
professional
my
dear
child
i
never
expected
this
he
began
you
are
looking
wretchedly
he
attempted
to
feel
her
pulse
she
drew
her
hand
away
from
him
it
s
my
mind
that
s
ill
she
answered
feeling
my
pulse
won
t
cure
me
of
anxiety
and
distress
i
want
advice
i
want
help
dear
old
doctor
you
have
always
been
a
good
friend
to
me
be
a
better
friend
than
ever
what
can
i
do
promise
you
will
keep
secret
what
i
am
going
to
say
to
you
and
listen
pray
listen
patiently
till
i
have
doctor
allday
promised
and
listened
he
had
been
in
some
degree
at
least
prepared
for
a
surprise
but
the
disclosure
which
now
burst
on
him
was
more
than
his
equanimity
could
sustain
he
looked
at
emily
in
silent
dismay
she
had
surprised
and
shocked
him
not
only
by
what
she
said
but
by
what
she
unconsciously
suggested
was
it
possible
that
mirabel
s
personal
appearance
had
produced
on
her
the
same
impression
which
was
present
in
his
own
mind
his
first
impulse
when
he
was
composed
enough
to
speak
urged
him
to
put
the
question
cautiously
if
you
happened
to
meet
with
the
suspected
man
he
said
have
you
any
means
of
identifying
him
none
whatever
doctor
if
you
would
only
think
it
over
he
stopped
her
there
convinced
of
the
danger
of
encouraging
her
and
resolved
to
act
on
his
conviction
i
have
enough
to
occupy
me
in
my
profession
he
said
ask
your
other
friend
to
think
it
what
other
friend
mr
alban
the
moment
he
pronounced
the
name
he
saw
that
he
had
touched
on
some
painful
association
has
morris
refused
to
help
you
he
inquired
i
have
not
asked
him
to
help
why
there
was
no
choice
with
such
a
man
as
doctor
allday
between
offending
him
or
answering
him
emily
adopted
the
last
alternative
on
this
occasion
she
had
no
reason
to
complain
of
his
silence
your
view
of
morris
s
conduct
surprises
me
he
replied
surprises
me
more
than
i
can
say
he
added
remembering
that
he
too
was
guilty
of
having
kept
her
in
ignorance
of
the
truth
out
of
regard
mistaken
regard
as
it
now
seemed
to
be
for
her
peace
of
mind
be
good
to
me
and
pass
it
over
if
i
am
wrong
emily
said
i
can
t
dispute
with
you
i
can
only
tell
you
what
i
feel
you
have
always
been
so
kind
to
me
may
i
count
on
your
kindness
still
doctor
allday
relapsed
into
silence
may
i
at
least
ask
she
went
on
if
you
know
anything
of
persons
she
paused
discouraged
by
the
cold
expression
of
inquiry
in
the
old
man
s
eyes
as
he
looked
at
her
what
persons
he
said
persons
whom
i
name
emily
named
the
landlady
of
the
inn
at
zeeland
she
could
now
place
the
right
interpretation
on
rook
s
conduct
when
the
locket
had
been
put
into
her
hand
at
netherwoods
doctor
allday
answered
shortly
and
stiffly
he
had
never
even
seen
rook
emily
mentioned
miss
jethro
next
and
saw
at
once
that
she
had
interested
him
what
do
you
suspect
miss
jethro
of
doing
he
asked
i
suspect
her
of
knowing
more
of
my
father
s
death
than
she
is
willing
to
acknowledge
emily
replied
the
doctor
s
manner
altered
for
the
better
i
agree
with
you
he
said
frankly
but
i
have
some
knowledge
of
that
lady
i
warn
you
not
to
waste
time
and
trouble
in
trying
to
discover
the
weak
side
of
miss
that
was
not
my
experience
of
her
at
school
emily
rejoined
at
the
same
time
i
don
t
know
what
may
have
happened
since
those
days
i
may
perhaps
have
lost
the
place
i
once
held
in
her
how
through
my
through
your
aunt
i
hope
and
trust
i
am
wrong
emily
continued
but
i
fear
my
aunt
had
something
to
do
with
miss
jethro
s
dismissal
from
the
school
and
in
that
case
miss
jethro
may
have
found
it
her
eyes
resting
on
the
doctor
suddenly
brightened
you
know
something
about
it
she
exclaimed
he
considered
a
little
whether
he
should
or
should
not
tell
her
of
the
letter
addressed
by
miss
ladd
to
miss
letitia
which
he
had
found
at
the
cottage
if
i
could
satisfy
you
that
your
fears
are
well
founded
he
asked
would
the
discovery
keep
you
away
from
miss
jethro
i
should
be
ashamed
to
speak
to
her
even
if
we
very
well
i
can
tell
you
positively
that
your
aunt
was
the
person
who
turned
miss
jethro
out
of
the
school
when
i
get
home
i
will
send
you
a
letter
that
proves
emily
s
head
sank
on
her
breast
why
do
i
only
hear
of
this
now
she
said
because
i
had
no
reason
for
letting
you
know
of
it
before
if
i
have
done
nothing
else
i
have
at
least
succeeded
in
keeping
you
and
miss
jethro
emily
looked
at
him
in
alarm
he
went
on
without
appearing
to
notice
that
he
had
startled
her
i
wish
to
god
i
could
as
easily
put
a
stop
to
the
mad
project
which
you
are
the
mad
project
emily
repeated
oh
doctor
allday
do
you
cruelly
leave
me
to
myself
at
the
time
of
all
others
when
i
am
most
in
need
of
your
sympathy
that
appeal
moved
him
he
spoke
more
gently
he
pitied
while
he
condemned
her
my
poor
dear
child
i
should
be
cruel
indeed
if
i
encouraged
you
you
are
giving
yourself
up
to
an
enterprise
so
shockingly
unsuited
to
a
young
girl
like
you
that
i
declare
i
contemplate
it
with
horror
think
i
entreat
you
think
and
let
me
hear
that
you
have
yielded
not
to
my
poor
entreaties
but
to
your
own
better
sense
his
voice
faltered
his
eyes
moistened
i
shall
make
a
fool
of
myself
he
burst
out
furiously
if
i
stay
here
any
longer
he
left
her
she
walked
to
the
window
and
looked
out
at
the
fair
morning
no
one
to
feel
for
her
no
one
to
understand
her
nothing
nearer
that
could
speak
to
poor
mortality
of
hope
and
encouragement
than
the
bright
heaven
so
far
away
she
turned
from
the
window
the
sun
shines
on
the
murderer
she
thought
as
it
shines
on
she
sat
down
at
the
table
and
tried
to
quiet
her
mind
to
think
steadily
to
some
good
purpose
of
the
few
friends
that
she
possessed
every
one
had
declared
that
she
was
in
the
wrong
had
lost
the
one
loved
being
of
all
beings
on
earth
and
lost
him
by
the
hand
of
a
homicide
and
that
homicide
free
all
that
was
faithful
all
that
was
devoted
in
the
girl
s
nature
held
her
to
her
desperate
resolution
as
with
a
hand
of
iron
if
she
shrank
at
that
miserable
moment
it
was
not
from
her
design
it
was
from
the
sense
of
her
own
helplessness
oh
if
i
had
been
a
man
she
said
to
herself
oh
if
i
could
find
a
friend
chapter
liii
the
friend
is
found
ellmother
looked
into
the
parlor
i
told
you
mirabel
would
call
again
she
announced
here
he
has
he
asked
to
see
me
he
leaves
it
entirely
to
for
a
moment
and
a
moment
only
emily
was
undecided
show
him
in
she
said
mirabel
s
embarrassment
was
visible
the
moment
he
entered
the
room
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
in
the
presence
of
a
woman
the
popular
preacher
was
shy
he
who
had
taken
hundreds
of
fair
hands
with
sympathetic
pressure
he
who
had
offered
fluent
consolation
abroad
and
at
home
to
beauty
in
distress
was
conscious
of
a
rising
color
and
was
absolutely
at
a
loss
for
words
when
emily
received
him
and
yet
though
he
appeared
at
disadvantage
and
worse
still
though
he
was
aware
of
it
himself
there
was
nothing
contemptible
in
his
look
and
manner
his
silence
and
confusion
revealed
a
change
in
him
which
inspired
respect
love
had
developed
this
spoiled
darling
of
foolish
congregations
this
effeminate
pet
of
and
boudoirs
into
the
likeness
of
a
man
and
no
woman
in
emily
s
position
could
have
failed
to
see
that
it
was
love
which
she
herself
had
inspired
equally
ill
at
ease
they
both
took
refuge
in
the
commonplace
phrases
suggested
by
the
occasion
these
exhausted
there
was
a
pause
mirabel
alluded
to
cecilia
as
a
means
of
continuing
the
conversation
have
you
seen
miss
wyvil
he
inquired
she
was
here
last
night
and
i
expect
to
see
her
again
before
she
returns
to
monksmoor
with
her
father
do
you
go
back
with
them
yes
if
i
remain
in
then
i
remain
in
london
the
strong
feeling
that
was
in
him
had
forced
its
way
to
expression
at
last
in
happier
days
when
she
had
persistently
refused
to
let
him
speak
to
her
seriously
she
would
have
been
ready
with
a

she
was
silent
now
mirabel
pleaded
with
her
not
to
misunderstand
him
by
an
honest
confession
of
his
motives
which
presented
him
under
a
new
aspect
the
easy
plausible
man
who
had
hardly
ever
seemed
to
be
in
earnest
before
meant
seriously
meant
what
he
said
now
may
i
try
to
explain
myself
he
asked
certainly
if
you
wish
pray
don
t
suppose
me
capable
mirabel
said
earnestly
of
presuming
to
pay
you
an
idle
compliment
i
can
not
think
of
you
alone
and
in
trouble
without
feeling
anxiety
which
can
only
be
relieved
in
one
way
i
must
be
near
enough
to
hear
of
you
day
by
day
not
by
repeating
this
visit
unless
you
wish
it
i
will
not
again
cross
the
threshold
of
your
door
ellmother
will
tell
me
if
your
mind
is
more
at
ease
ellmother
will
tell
me
if
there
is
any
new
trial
of
your
fortitude
she
needn
t
even
mention
that
i
have
been
speaking
to
her
at
the
door
and
she
may
be
sure
and
you
may
be
sure
that
i
shall
ask
no
inquisitive
questions
i
can
feel
for
you
in
your
misfortune
without
wishing
to
know
what
that
misfortune
is
if
i
can
ever
be
of
the
smallest
use
think
of
me
as
your
other
servant
say
to
ellmother
i
want
him
and
say
no
where
is
the
woman
who
could
have
resisted
such
devotion
as
this
inspired
truly
inspired
by
herself
emily
s
eyes
softened
as
she
answered
him
you
little
know
how
your
kindness
touches
me
she
said
don
t
speak
of
my
kindness
until
you
have
put
me
to
the
proof
he
interposed
can
a
friend
such
a
friend
as
i
am
i
mean
be
of
any
use
of
the
greatest
use
if
i
could
feel
justified
in
trying
i
entreat
you
to
try
me
but
mirabel
you
don
t
know
what
i
am
thinking
i
don
t
want
to
i
may
be
wrong
my
friends
all
say
i
i
don
t
care
what
your
friends
say
i
don
t
care
about
any
earthly
thing
but
your
tranquillity
does
your
dog
ask
whether
you
are
right
or
wrong
i
am
your
dog
i
think
of
you
and
i
think
of
nothing
she
looked

through
the
experience
of
the
last
few
days
miss
ladd
ellmother
doctor
allday
not
one
of
them
had
felt
for
her
not
one
of
them
had
spoken
to
her
as
this
man
had
felt
and
had
spoken
she
remembered
the
dreadful
sense
of
solitude
and
helplessness
which
had
wrung
her
heart
in
the
interval
before
mirabel
came
in
her
father
himself
could
hardly
have
been
kinder
to
her
than
this
friend
of
a
few
weeks
only
she
looked
at
him
through
her
tears
she
could
say
nothing
that
was
eloquent
nothing
even
that
was
adequate
you
are
very
good
to
me
was
her
only
acknowledgment
of
all
that
he
had
offered
how
poor
it
seemed
to
be
and
yet
how
much
it
meant
he
rose
saying
considerately
that
he
would
leave
her
to
recover
herself
and
would
wait
to
hear
if
he
was
wanted
no
she
said
i
must
not
let
you
go
in
common
gratitude
i
ought
to
decide
before
you
leave
me
and
i
do
decide
to
take
you
into
my
she
hesitated
her
color
rose
a
little
i
know
how
unselfishly
you
offer
me
your
help
she
resumed
i
know
you
speak
to
me
as
a
brother
might
speak
to
a
sister
he
gently
interrupted
her
no
he
said
i
can
t
honestly
claim
to
do
that
and
may
i
venture
to
remind
you
you
know
she
started
her
eyes
rested
on
him
with
a
momentary
expression
of
reproach
is
it
quite
fair
she
asked
in
my
situation
to
say
that
would
it
have
been
quite
fair
he
rejoined
to
allow
you
to
deceive
yourself
should
i
deserve
to
be
taken
into
your
confidence
if
i
encouraged
you
to
trust
me
under
false
pretenses
not
a
word
more
of
those
hopes
on
which
the
happiness
of
my
life
depends
shall
pass
my
lips
unless
you
permit
it
in
my
devotion
to
your
interests
i
promise
to
forget
myself
my
motives
may
be
misinterpreted
my
position
may
be
misunderstood
ignorant
people
may
take
me
for
that
other
happier
man
who
is
an
object
of
interest
to
you
stop
mirabel
the
person
to
whom
you
refer
has
no
such
claim
on
me
as
you
dare
i
say
how
happy
i
am
to
hear
it
will
you
forgive
me
i
will
forgive
you
if
you
say
no
their
eyes
met
completely
overcome
by
the
new
hope
that
she
had
inspired
mirabel
was
unable
to
answer
her
his
sensitive
nerves
trembled
under
emotion
like
the
nerves
of
a
woman
his
delicate
complexion
faded
away
slowly
into
whiteness
emily
was
alarmed
he
seemed
to
be
on
the
point
of
fainting
she
ran
to
the
window
to
open
it
more
widely
pray
don
t
trouble
yourself
he
said
i
am
easily
agitated
by
any
sudden
sensation
and
i
am
a
little
overcome
at
this
moment
by
my
own
let
me
give
you
a
glass
of
thank
you
i
don
t
need
it
you
really
feel
better
i
feel
quite
well
again
and
eager
to
hear
how
i
can
serve
it
s
a
long
story
mirabel
and
a
dreadful
dreadful
yes
let
me
tell
you
first
how
you
can
serve
me
i
am
in
search
of
a
man
who
has
done
me
the
cruelest
wrong
that
one
human
creature
can
inflict
on
another
but
the
chances
are
all
against
me
i
am
only
a
woman
and
i
don
t
know
how
to
take
even
the
first
step
toward
you
will
know
when
i
guide
he
reminded
her
tenderly
of
what
she
might
expect
from
him
and
was
rewarded
by
a
grateful
look
seeing
nothing
suspecting
nothing
they
advanced
together
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
end
once
or
twice
emily
continued
i
spoke
to
you
of
my
poor
father
when
we
were
at
monksmoor
and
i
must
speak
of
him
again
you
could
have
no
interest
in
inquiring
about
a
stranger
and
you
can
not
have
heard
how
he
pardon
me
i
heard
from
wyvil
how
he
you
heard
what
i
had
told
wyvil
emily
said
i
was
wrong
mirabel
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
courteous
surprise
was
it
not
a
sudden
death
it
a
sudden
caused
by
disease
of
the
heart
caused
by
no
disease
i
have
been
deceived
about
my
father
s
death
and
i
have
only
discovered
it
a
few
days
at
the
impending
moment
of
the
frightful
shock
which
she
was
innocently
about
to
inflict
on
him
she
stopped
doubtful
whether
it
would
be
best
to
relate
how
the
discovery
had
been
made
or
to
pass
at
once
to
the
result
mirabel
supposed
that
she
had
paused
to
control
her
agitation
he
was
so
immeasurably
far
away
from
the
faintest
suspicion
of
what
was
coming
that
he
exerted
his
ingenuity
in
the
hope
of
sparing
her
i
can
anticipate
the
rest
he
said
your
sad
loss
has
been
caused
by
some
fatal
accident
let
us
change
the
subject
tell
me
more
of
that
man
whom
i
must
help
you
to
find
it
will
only
distress
you
to
dwell
on
your
father
s
distress
me
she
repeated
his
death
maddens
me
oh
don
t
say
that
hear
me
hear
me
my
father
died
murdered
at
zeeland
and
the
man
you
must
help
me
to
find
is
the
wretch
who
killed
she
started
to
her
feet
with
a
cry
of
terror
mirabel
dropped
from
his
chair
senseless
to
the
floor
chapter
liv
the
end
of
the
fainting
fit
emily
recovered
her
presence
of
mind
she
opened
the
door
so
as
to
make
a
draught
of
air
in
the
room
and
called
for
water
returning
to
mirabel
she
loosened
his
cravat
ellmother
came
in
just
in
time
to
prevent
her
from
committing
a
common
error
in
the
treatment
of
fainting
persons
by
raising
mirabel
s
head
the
current
of
air
and
the
sprinkling
of
water
over
his
face
soon
produced
their
customary
effect
he
ll
come
round
directly
ellmother
remarked
your
aunt
was
sometimes
taken
with
these
swoons
miss
and
i
know
something
about
them
he
looks
a
poor
weak
creature
in
spite
of
his
big
beard
has
anything
frightened
him
emily
little
knew
how
correctly
that
chance
guess
had
hit
on
the
truth
nothing
can
possibly
have
frightened
him
she
replied
i
am
afraid
he
is
in
bad
health
he
turned
suddenly
pale
while
we
were
talking
and
i
thought
he
was
going
to
be
taken
ill
he
made
light
of
it
and
seemed
to
recover
unfortunately
i
was
right
it
was
the
threatening
of
a
fainting
fit
he
dropped
on
the
floor
a
minute
a
sigh
fluttered
over
mirabel
s
lips
his
eyes
opened
looked
at
ellmother
in
vacant
terror
and
closed
again
emily
whispered
to
her
to
leave
the
room
the
old
woman
smiled
satirically
as
she
opened
the
door
then
looked
back
with
a
sudden
change
of
humor
to
see
the
kind
young
mistress
bending
over
the
feeble
little
clergyman
set
her
by
some
strange
association
of
ideas
thinking
of
alban
morris
ah
she
muttered
to
herself
on
her
way
out
i
call
a
man
there
was
wine
in
the
sideboard
the
wine
which
emily
had
once
already
offered
in
vain
mirabel
drank
it
eagerly
this
time
he
looked
round
the
room
as
if
he
wished
to
be
sure
that
they
were
alone
have
i
fallen
to
a
low
place
in
your
estimation
he
asked
smiling
faintly
i
am
afraid
you
will
think
poorly
enough
of
your
new
ally
after
this
i
only
think
you
should
take
more
care
of
your
health
emily
replied
with
sincere
interest
in
his
recovery
let
me
leave
you
to
rest
on
the
he
refused
to
remain
at
the
cottage
he
asked
with
a
sudden
change
to
fretfulness
if
she
would
let
her
servant
get
him
a
cab
she
ventured
to
doubt
whether
he
was
quite
strong
enough
yet
to
go
away
by
himself
he
reiterated
piteously
reiterated
his
request
a
passing
cab
was
stopped
directly
emily
accompanied
him
to
the
gate
i
know
what
to
do
he
said
in
a
hurried
absent
way
rest
and
a
little
tonic
medicine
will
soon
set
me
the
clammy
coldness
of
his
skin
made
emily
shudder
as
they
shook
hands
you
won
t
think
the
worse
of
me
for
this
he
asked
how
can
you
imagine
such
a
thing
she
answered
warmly
will
you
see
me
if
i
come
i
shall
be
anxious
to
see
so
they
parted

to

mirabel
sees
his
way
reaching
the
hotel
at
which
he
was
accustomed
to
stay
when
he
was
in
london
mirabel
locked
the
door
of
his
room
he
looked
at
the
houses
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
his
mind
was
in
such
a
state
of
morbid
distrust
that
he
lowered
the
blind
over
the
window
in
solitude
and
obscurity
the
miserable
wretch
sat
down
in
a
corner
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
tried
to
realize
what
had
happened
to
him
nothing
had
been
said
at
the
fatal
interview
with
emily
which
could
have
given
him
the
slightest
warning
of
what
was
to
come
her
father
s
name
absolutely
unknown
to
him
when
he
fled
from
the
inn
had
only
been
communicated
to
the
public
by
the
newspaper
reports
of
the
adjourned
inquest
at
the
time
when
those
reports
appeared
he
was
in
hiding
under
circumstances
which
prevented
him
from
seeing
a
newspaper
while
the
murder
was
still
a
subject
of
conversation
he
was
in
france
far
out
of
the
track
of
english
travelers
and
he
remained
on
the
continent
until
the
summer
of
eighteen
hundred
and
no
exercise
of
discretion
on
his
part
could
have
extricated
him
from
the
terrible
position
in
which
he
was
now
placed
he
stood
pledged
to
emily
to
discover
the
man
suspected
of
the
murder
of
her
father
and
that
man
was
himself
what
refuge
was
left
open
to
him
if
he
took
to
flight
his
sudden
disappearance
would
be
a
suspicious
circumstance
in
itself
and
would
therefore
provoke
inquiries
which
might
lead
to
serious
results
supposing
that
he
overlooked
the
risk
thus
presented
would
he
be
capable
of
enduring
a
separation
from
emily
which
might
be
a
separation
for
life
even
in
the
first
horror
of
discovering
his
situation
her
influence
remained
unshaken
the
animating
spirit
of
the
one
manly
capacity
for
resistance
which
raised
him
above
the
reach
of
his
own
fears
the
only
prospect
before
him
which
he
felt
himself
to
be
incapable
of
contemplating
was
the
prospect
of
leaving
emily
having
arrived
at
this
conclusion
his
fears
urged
him
to
think
of
providing
for
his
own
safety
the
first
precaution
to
adopt
was
to
separate
emily
from
friends
whose
advice
might
be
hostile
to
his
interests
perhaps
even
subversive
of
his
security
to
effect
this
design
he
had
need
of
an
ally
whom
he
could
trust
that
ally
was
at
his
disposal
far
away
in
the
north
at
the
time
when
francine
s
jealousy
began
to
interfere
with
all
freedom
of
intercourse
between
emily
and
himself
at
monksmoor
he
had
contemplated
making
arrangements
which
might
enable
them
to
meet
at
the
house
of
his
invalid
sister
delvin
he
had
spoken
of
her
and
of
the
bodily
affliction
which
confined
her
to
her
room
in
terms
which
had
already
interested
emily
in
the
present
emergency
he
decided
on
returning
to
the
subject
and
on
hastening
the
meeting
between
the
two
women
which
he
had
first
suggested
at
wyvil
s
country
seat
no
time
was
to
be
lost
in
carrying
out
this
intention
he
wrote
to
delvin
by
that
day
s
post
confiding
to
her
in
the
first
place
the
critical
position
in
which
he
now
found
himself
this
done
he
proceeded
as
follows
to
your
sound
judgment
dearest
agatha
it
may
appear
that
i
am
making
myself
needlessly
uneasy
about
the
future
two
persons
only
know
that
i
am
the
man
who
escaped
from
the
inn
at
zeeland
you
are
one
of
them
and
miss
jethro
is
the
other
on
you
i
can
absolutely
rely
and
after
my
experience
of
her
i
ought
to
feel
sure
of
miss
jethro
i
admit
this
but
i
can
not
get
over
my
distrust
of
emily
s
friends
i
fear
the
cunning
old
doctor
i
doubt
wyvil
i
hate
alban
morris
do
me
a
favor
my
dear
invite
emily
to
be
your
guest
and
so
separate
her
from
these
friends
the
old
servant
who
attends
on
her
will
be
included
in
the
invitation
of
course
ellmother
is
as
i
believe
devoted
to
the
interests
of
alban
morris
she
will
be
well
out
of
the
way
of
doing
mischief
while
we
have
her
safe
in
your
northern
solitude
there
is
no
fear
that
emily
will
refuse
your
invitation
in
the
first
place
she
is
already
interested
in
you
in
the
second
place
i
shall
consider
the
small
proprieties
of
social
life
and
instead
of
traveling
with
her
to
your
house
i
shall
follow
by
a
later
train
in
the
third
place
i
am
now
the
chosen
adviser
in
whom
she
trusts
and
what
i
tell
her
to
do
she
will
do
it
pains
me
really
and
truly
pains
me
to
be
compelled
to
deceive
her
but
the
other
alternative
is
to
reveal
myself
as
the
wretch
of
whom
she
is
in
search
was
there
ever
such
a
situation
and
oh
agatha
i
am
so
fond
of
her
if
i
fail
to
persuade
her
to
be
my
wife
i
don
t
care
what
becomes
of
me
i
used
to
think
disgrace
and
death
on
the
scaffold
the
most
frightful
prospect
that
a
man
can
contemplate
in
my
present
frame
of
mind
a
life
without
emily
may
just
as
well
end
in
that
way
as
in
any
other
when
we
are
together
in
your
old
tower
do
your
best
my
dear
to
incline
the
heart
of
this
sweet
girl
toward
me
if
she
remains
in
london
how
do
i
know
that
morris
may
not
recover
the
place
he
has
lost
in
her
good
opinion
the
bare
idea
of
it
turns
me
cold
there
is
one
more
point
on
which
i
must
touch
before
i
can
finish
my
letter
when
you
last
wrote
you
told
me
that
sir
jervis
redwood
was
not
expected
to
live
much
longer
and
that
the
establishment
would
be
broken
up
after
his
death
can
you
find
out
for
me
what
will
become
under
the
circumstances
of
and
rook
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
don
t
doubt
that
the
alteration
in
my
personal
appearance
which
has
protected
me
for
years
past
may
be
trusted
to
preserve
me
from
recognition
by
these
two
people
but
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
remembering
the
project
to
which
emily
has
devoted
herself
that
she
should
not
meet
with
rook
they
have
been
already
in
correspondence
and
rook
has
expressed
an
intention
if
the
opportunity
offers
itself
of
calling
at
the
cottage
another
reason
and
a
pressing
reason
for
removing
emily
from
london
we
can
easily
keep
the
rooks
out
of
house
but
i
own
i
should
feel
more
at
my
ease
if
i
heard
that
they
had
left
with
that
confession
delvin
s
brother
closed
his
letter
chapter
lvi
alban
sees
his
way
during
the
first
days
of
mirabel
s
sojourn
at
his
hotel
in
london
events
were
in
progress
at
netherwoods
affecting
the
interests
of
the
man
who
was
the
especial
object
of
his
distrust
not
long
after
miss
ladd
had
returned
to
her
school
she
heard
of
an
artist
who
was
capable
of
filling
the
place
to
be
vacated
by
alban
morris
it
was
then
the
of
the
month
in
four
days
more
the
new
master
would
be
ready
to
enter
on
his
duties
and
alban
would
be
at
liberty
on
the
alban
received
a
telegram
which
startled
him
the
person
sending
the
message
was
ellmother
and
the
words
were
meet
me
at
your
railway
station
at
two
o
he
found
the
old
woman
in
the
and
he
met
with
a
rough
reception
minutes
are
precious
morris
she
said
you
are
two
minutes
late
the
next
train
to
london
stops
here
in
half
an
hour
and
i
must
go
back
by
good
heavens
what
brings
you
here
is
emily
emily
is
well
enough
in
health
if
that
s
what
you
mean
as
to
why
i
come
here
the
reason
is
that
it
s
a
deal
easier
for
me
worse
luck
to
take
this
journey
than
to
write
a
letter
one
good
turn
deserves
another
i
don
t
forget
how
kind
you
were
to
me
away
there
at
the
school
and
i
can
t
and
won
t
see
what
s
going
on
at
the
cottage
behind
your
back
without
letting
you
know
of
it
oh
you
needn
t
be
alarmed
about
i
ve
made
an
excuse
to
get
away
for
a
few
hours
but
i
haven
t
left
her
by
herself
miss
wyvil
has
come
to
london
again
and
mirabel
spends
the
best
part
of
his
time
with
her
excuse
me
for
a
moment
will
you
i
m
so
thirsty
after
the
journey
i
can
hardly
she
presented
herself
at
the
counter
in
the
i
ll
trouble
you
young
woman
for
a
glass
of
she
returned
to
alban
in
a
better
humor
it
s
not
bad
stuff
that
when
i
have
said
my
say
i
ll
have
a
drop
more
just
to
wash
the
taste
of
mirabel
out
of
my
mouth
wait
a
bit
i
have
something
to
ask
you
how
much
longer
are
you
obliged
to
stop
here
teaching
the
girls
to
draw
i
leave
netherwoods
in
three
days
more
alban
replied
that
s
all
right
you
may
be
in
time
to
bring
miss
emily
to
her
senses
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
if
you
don
t
stop
it
she
will
marry
the
i
can
t
believe
it
ellmother
i
won
t
believe
it
ah
it
s
a
comfort
to
him
poor
fellow
to
say
that
look
here
morris
this
is
how
it
stands
you
re
in
disgrace
with
miss
emily
and
he
profits
by
it
i
was
fool
enough
to
take
a
liking
to
mirabel
when
i
first
opened
the
door
to
him
i
know
better
now
he
got
on
the
blind
side
of
me
and
now
he
has
got
on
the
blind
side
of
shall
i
tell
you
how
by
doing
what
you
would
have
done
if
you
had
had
the
chance
he
s
helping
her
or
pretending
to
help
her
i
don
t
know
which
to
find
the
man
who
murdered
poor
brown
after
four
years
and
when
all
the
police
in
england
with
a
reward
to
encourage
them
did
their
best
and
it
came
to
nothing
never
mind
that
alban
said
impatiently
i
want
to
know
how
mirabel
is
helping
her
that
s
more
than
i
can
tell
you
you
don
t
suppose
they
take
me
into
their
confidence
all
i
can
do
is
to
pick
up
a
word
here
and
there
when
fine
weather
tempts
them
out
into
the
garden
she
tells
him
to
suspect
rook
and
to
make
inquiries
after
miss
jethro
and
he
has
his
plans
and
he
writes
them
down
which
is
dead
against
his
doing
anything
useful
in
my
opinion
i
don
t
hold
with
your
scribblers
at
the
same
time
i
wouldn
t
count
too
positively
in
your
place
on
his
being
likely
to
fail
that
little
mirabel
if
it
wasn
t
for
his
beard
i
should
believe
he
was
a
woman
and
a
sickly
woman
too
he
fainted
in
our
house
the
other
day
that
little
mirabel
is
in
earnest
rather
than
leave
miss
emily
from
saturday
to
monday
he
has
got
a
parson
out
of
employment
to
do
his
sunday
work
for
him
and
what
s
more
he
has
persuaded
her
for
some
reasons
of
his
own
to
leave
london
next
is
she
going
back
to
monksmoor
not
she
mirabel
has
got
a
sister
a
widow
lady
she
s
a
cripple
or
something
of
the
sort
her
name
is
delvin
she
lives
far
away
in
the
north
country
by
the
sea
and
miss
emily
is
going
to
stay
with
are
you
sure
of
that
sure
i
ve
seen
the
do
you
mean
the
letter
of
invitation
yes
i
do
miss
emily
herself
showed
it
to
me
i
m
to
go
with
her
in
attendance
on
my
mistress
as
the
lady
puts
it
this
i
will
say
for
delvin
her
handwriting
is
a
credit
to
the
school
that
taught
her
and
the
poor
bedridden
creature
words
her
invitation
so
nicely
that
i
myself
couldn
t
have
resisted
it
and
i
m
a
hard
one
as
you
know
you
don
t
seem
to
heed
me
i
beg
your
pardon
i
was
thinking
of
what
if
i
may
make
so
bold
of
going
back
to
london
with
you
instead
of
waiting
till
the
new
master
comes
to
take
my
don
t
do
that
sir
you
would
do
harm
instead
of
good
if
you
showed
yourself
at
the
cottage
now
besides
it
would
not
be
fair
to
miss
ladd
to
leave
her
before
the
other
man
takes
your
girls
off
your
hands
trust
me
to
look
after
your
interests
and
don
t
go
near
miss
emily
don
t
even
write
to
her
unless
you
have
got
something
to
say
about
the
murder
which
she
will
be
eager
to
hear
make
some
discovery
in
that
direction
morris
while
the
parson
is
only
trying
to
do
it
or
pretending
to
do
it
and
i
ll
answer
for
the
result
look
at
the
clock
in
ten
minutes
more
the
train
will
be
here
my
memory
isn
t
as
good
as
it
was
but
i
do
think
i
have
told
you
all
i
had
to
you
are
the
best
of
good
friends
alban
said
warmly
never
mind
about
that
sir
if
you
want
to
do
a
friendly
thing
in
return
tell
me
if
you
know
what
has
become
of
miss
de
she
has
returned
to
aha
miss
ladd
is
as
good
as
her
word
would
you
mind
writing
to
tell
me
of
it
if
miss
de
sor
leaves
the
school
again
good
lord
there
she
is
on
the
platform
with
bag
and
baggage
don
t
let
her
see
me
morris
if
she
comes
in
here
i
shall
set
the
marks
of
my
ten
on
that
false
face
of
hers
as
sure
as
i
am
a
christian
alban
placed
himself
at
the
door
so
as
to
hide
ellmother
there
indeed
was
francine
accompanied
by
one
of
the
teachers
at
the
school
she
took
a
seat
on
the
bench
outside
the
in
a
state
of
sullen
indifference
absorbed
in
herself
noticing
nothing
urged
by
ungovernable
curiosity
ellmother
stole
on
tiptoe
to
alban
s
side
to
look
at
her
to
a
person
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
there
could
be
no
possible
doubt
of
what
had
happened
francine
had
failed
to
excuse
herself
and
had
been
dismissed
from
miss
ladd
s
house
i
would
have
traveled
to
the
world
s
end
ellmother
said
to
see
she
returned
to
her
place
in
the
perfectly
satisfied
the
teacher
noticed
alban
on
leaving
the
after
taking
the
tickets
i
shall
be
glad
she
said
looking
toward
francine
when
i
have
resigned
the
charge
of
that
young
lady
to
the
person
who
is
to
receive
her
in
is
she
to
be
sent
back
to
her
parents
alban
asked
we
don
t
know
yet
miss
ladd
will
write
to
domingo
by
the
next
mail
in
the
meantime
her
father
s
agent
in
london
the
same
person
who
pays
her
allowance
takes
care
of
her
until
he
hears
from
the
west
does
she
consent
to
this
she
doesn
t
seem
to
care
what
becomes
of
her
miss
ladd
has
given
her
every
opportunity
of
explaining
and
excusing
herself
and
has
produced
no
impression
you
can
see
the
state
she
is
in
our
good
mistress
always
hopeful
even
in
the
worst
cases
as
you
know
thinks
she
is
feeling
ashamed
of
herself
and
is
too
proud
and
to
own
it
my
own
idea
is
that
some
secret
disappointment
is
weighing
on
her
mind
perhaps
i
am
no
miss
ladd
was
wrong
and
the
teacher
was
right
the
passion
of
revenge
being
essentially
selfish
in
its
nature
is
of
all
passions
the
narrowest
in
its
range
of
view
in
gratifying
her
jealous
hatred
of
emily
francine
had
correctly
foreseen
consequences
as
they
might
affect
the
other
object
of
her
enmity
alban
morris
but
she
had
failed
to
perceive
the
imminent
danger
of
another
result
which
in
a
calmer
frame
of
mind
might
not
have
escaped
discovery
in
triumphing
over
emily
and
alban
she
had
been
the
indirect
means
of
inflicting
on
herself
the
bitterest
of
all
disappointments
she
had
brought
emily
and
mirabel
together
the
first
forewarning
of
this
catastrophe
had
reached
her
on
hearing
that
mirabel
would
not
return
to
monksmoor
her
worst
fears
had
been
thereafter
confirmed
by
a
letter
from
cecilia
which
had
followed
her
to
netherwoods
from
that
moment
she
who
had
made
others
wretched
paid
the
penalty
in
suffering
as
keen
as
any
that
she
had
inflicted
completely
prostrated
powerless
through
ignorance
of
his
address
in
london
to
make
a
last
appeal
to
mirabel
she
was
literally
as
had
just
been
said
careless
what
became
of
her
when
the
train
approached
she
sprang
to
her
feet
advanced
to
the
edge
of
the
platform
and
suddenly
drew
back
shuddering
the
teacher
looked
in
terror
at
alban
had
the
desperate
girl
meditated
throwing
herself
under
the
wheels
of
the
engine
the
thought
had
been
in
both
their
minds
but
neither
of
them
acknowledged
it
francine
stepped
quietly
into
the
carriage
when
the
train
drew
up
and
laid
her
head
back
in
a
corner
and
closed
her
eyes
ellmother
took
her
place
in
another
compartment
and
beckoned
to
alban
to
speak
to
her
at
the
window
where
can
i
see
you
when
you
go
to
london
she
asked
at
doctor
allday
s
on
what
day
on
tuesday
chapter
lvii
approaching
the
end
alban
reached
london
early
enough
in
the
afternoon
to
find
the
doctor
at
his
luncheon
too
late
to
see
ellmother
he
announced
sit
down
and
have
something
to
has
she
left
any
message
for
me
a
message
my
good
friend
that
you
won
t
like
to
hear
she
is
off
with
her
mistress
this
morning
on
a
visit
to
mirabel
s
does
he
go
with
them
no
he
follows
by
a
later
has
ellmother
mentioned
the
address
there
it
is
in
her
own
alban
read
the
address
mrs
delvin
the
clink
belford
turn
to
the
back
of
that
bit
of
paper
the
doctor
said
mrs
ellmother
has
written
something
on
she
had
written
these
words
no
discoveries
made
by
mirabel
up
to
this
time
sir
jervis
redwood
is
dead
the
rooks
are
believed
to
be
in
scotland
and
miss
emily
if
need
be
is
to
help
the
parson
to
find
them
no
news
of
miss
now
you
have
got
your
information
doctor
allday
resumed
let
me
have
a
look
at
you
you
re
not
in
a
rage
that
s
a
good
sign
to
begin
i
am
not
the
less
determined
alban
answered
to
bring
emily
to
her
senses
the
doctor
asked
to
do
what
mirabel
has
done
and
then
to
let
her
choose
between
ay
ay
your
good
opinion
of
her
hasn
t
altered
though
she
has
treated
you
so
badly
my
good
opinion
makes
allowance
for
the
state
of
my
poor
darling
s
mind
after
the
shock
that
has
fallen
on
her
alban
answered
quietly
she
is
not
emily
now
she
will
be
emily
yet
i
told
her
i
was
convinced
of
it
in
the
old
days
at
school
and
my
conviction
is
as
strong
as
ever
have
you
seen
her
since
i
have
been
away
at
netherwoods
yes
and
she
is
as
angry
with
me
as
she
is
with
for
the
same
reason
no
no
i
heard
enough
to
warn
me
to
hold
my
tongue
i
refused
to
help
her
that
s
all
you
are
a
man
and
you
may
run
risks
which
no
young
girl
ought
to
encounter
do
you
remember
when
i
asked
you
to
drop
all
further
inquiries
into
the
murder
for
emily
s
sake
the
circumstances
have
altered
since
that
time
can
i
be
of
any
use
of
the
greatest
use
if
you
can
give
me
miss
jethro
s
oh
you
mean
to
begin
in
that
way
do
you
yes
you
know
that
miss
jethro
visited
me
at
netherwoods
go
she
showed
me
your
answer
to
a
letter
which
she
had
written
to
you
have
you
got
that
letter
doctor
allday
produced
it
the
address
was
at
a
in
a
town
on
the
south
coast
looking
up
when
he
had
copied
it
alban
saw
the
doctor
s
eyes
fixed
on
him
with
an
expression
partly
of
sympathy
partly
of
hesitation
have
you
anything
to
suggest
he
asked
you
will
get
nothing
out
of
miss
jethro
the
doctor
answered
unless
there
he
stopped
unless
what
unless
you
can
frighten
how
am
i
to
do
that
after
a
little
reflection
doctor
allday
returned
without
any
apparent
reason
to
the
subject
of
his
last
visit
to
emily
there
was
one
thing
she
said
in
the
course
of
our
talk
he
continued
which
struck
me
as
being
sensible
possibly
for
we
are
all
more
or
less
conceited
because
i
agreed
with
her
myself
she
suspects
miss
jethro
of
knowing
more
about
that
damnable
murder
than
miss
jethro
is
willing
to
acknowledge
if
you
want
to
produce
the
right
effect
on
her
he
looked
hard
at
alban
and
checked
himself
once
more
well
what
am
i
to
do
tell
her
you
have
an
idea
of
who
the
murderer
but
i
have
no
but
good
god
what
do
you
mean
don
t
mistake
me
an
impression
has
been
produced
on
my
mind
that
s
all
call
it
a
freak
or
fancy
worth
trying
perhaps
as
a
bold
experiment
and
worth
nothing
more
come
a
little
nearer
my
housekeeper
is
an
excellent
woman
but
i
have

a
council
of
two
early
in
the
last
century
one
of
the
picturesque
race
of
robbers
and
murderers
practicing
the
vices
of
humanity
on
the
borderlands
watered
by
the
river
tweed
built
a
tower
of
stone
on
the
coast
of
northumberland
he
lived
joyously
in
the
perpetration
of
atrocities
and
he
died
penitent
under
the
direction
of
his
priest
since
that
event
he
has
figured
in
poems
and
pictures
and
has
been
greatly
admired
by
modern
ladies
and
gentlemen
whom
he
would
have
outraged
and
robbed
if
he
had
been
lucky
enough
to
meet
with
them
in
the
good
old
times
his
son
succeeded
him
and
failed
to
profit
by
the
paternal
example
that
is
to
say
he
made
the
fatal
mistake
of
fighting
for
other
people
instead
of
fighting
for
himself
in
the
rebellion
of
this
northern
squire
sided
to
serious
purpose
with
prince
charles
and
the
highlanders
he
lost
his
head
and
his
children
lost
their
inheritance
in
the
lapse
of
years
the
confiscated
property
fell
into
the
hands
of
strangers
the
last
of
whom
having
a
taste
for
the
turf
discovered
in
course
of
time
that
he
was
in
want
of
money
a
retired
merchant
named
delvin
originally
of
french
extraction
took
a
liking
to
the
wild
situation
and
purchased
the
tower
his
wife
already
in
failing
health
had
been
ordered
by
the
doctors
to
live
a
quiet
life
by
the
sea
her
husband
s
death
left
her
a
rich
and
lonely
widow
by
day
and
night
alike
a
prisoner
in
her
room
wasted
by
disease
and
having
but
two
interests
which
reconciled
her
to
life
writing
poetry
in
the
intervals
of
pain
and
paying
the
debts
of
a
reverend
brother
who
succeeded
in
the
pulpit
and
prospered
nowhere
else
in
the
later
days
of
its
life
the
tower
had
been
greatly
improved
as
a
place
of
residence
the
contrast
was
remarkable
between
the
dreary
gray
outer
walls
and
the
luxuriously
furnished
rooms
inside
rising
by
two
at
a
time
to
the
lofty
eighth
story
of
the
building
among
the
scattered
populace
of
the
country
round
the
tower
was
still
known
by
the
odd
name
given
to
it
in
the
bygone
time
the
it
had
been
so
called
as
was
supposed
in
allusion
to
the
noise
made
by
loose
stones
washed
backward
and
forward
at
certain
times
of
the
tide
in
hollows
of
the
rock
on
which
the
building
stood
on
the
evening
of
her
arrival
at
delvin
s
retreat
emily
retired
at
an
early
hour
fatigued
by
her
long
journey
mirabel
had
an
opportunity
of
speaking
with
his
sister
privately
in
her
own
room
send
me
away
agatha
if
i
disturb
you
he
said
and
let
me
know
when
i
can
see
you
in
the
my
dear
miles
have
you
forgotten
that
i
am
never
able
to
sleep
in
calm
weather
my
lullaby
for
years
past
has
been
the
moaning
of
the
great
north
sea
under
my
window
listen
there
is
not
a
sound
outside
on
this
peaceful
night
it
is
the
right
time
of
the
tide
just
now
and
yet
the
clink
is
not
to
be
heard
is
the
moon
up
mirabel
opened
the
curtains
the
whole
sky
is
one
great
abyss
of
black
he
answered
if
i
was
superstitious
i
should
think
that
horrid
darkness
a
bad
omen
for
the
future
are
you
suffering
agatha
not
just
now
i
suppose
i
look
sadly
changed
for
the
worse
since
you
saw
me
last
but
for
the
feverish
brightness
of
her
eyes
she
would
have
looked
like
a
corpse
her
wrinkled
forehead
her
hollow
cheeks
her
white
lips
told
their
terrible
tale
of
the
suffering
of
years
the
ghastly
appearance
of
her
face
was
heightened
by
the
furnishing
of
the
room
this
doomed
woman
dying
slowly
day
by
day
delighted
in
bright
colors
and
sumptuous
materials
the
paper
on
the
walls
the
curtains
the
carpet
presented
the
hues
of
the
rainbow
she
lay
on
a
couch
covered
with
purple
silk
under
draperies
of
green
velvet
to
keep
her
warm
rich
lace
hid
h
er
scanty
hair
turning
prematurely
gray
brilliant
rings
glittered
on
her
bony
fingers
the
room
was
in
a
blaze
of
light
from
lamps
and
candles
even
the
wine
at
her
side
that
kept
her
alive
had
been
decanted
into
a
bottle
of
lustrous
venetian
glass
my
grave
is
open
she
used
to
say
and
i
want
all
these
beautiful
things
to
keep
me
from
looking
at
it
i
should
die
at
once
if
i
was
left
in
the
her
brother
sat
by
the
couch
thinking
shall
i
tell
you
what
is
in
your
mind
she
asked
mirabel
humored
the
caprice
of
the
moment
tell
me
he
said
you
want
to
know
what
i
think
of
emily
she
answered
your
letter
told
me
you
were
in
love
but
i
didn
t
believe
your
letter
i
have
always
doubted
whether
you
were
capable
of
feeling
true
love
until
i
saw
emily
the
moment
she
entered
the
room
i
knew
that
i
had
never
properly
appreciated
my
brother
you
in
love
with
her
miles
and
you
are
a
better
man
than
i
thought
you
does
that
express
my
opinion
mirabel
took
her
wasted
hand
and
kissed
it
gratefully
what
a
position
i
am
in
he
said
to
love
her
as
i
love
her
and
if
she
knew
the
truth
to
be
the
object
of
her
horror
to
be
the
man
whom
she
would
hunt
to
the
scaffold
as
an
act
of
duty
to
the
memory
of
her
father
you
have
left
out
the
worst
part
of
it
delvin
reminded
him
you
have
bound
yourself
to
help
her
to
find
the
man
your
one
hope
of
persuading
her
to
become
your
wife
rests
on
your
success
in
finding
him
and
you
are
the
man
there
is
your
situation
you
can
t
submit
to
it
how
can
you
escape
from
it
you
are
trying
to
frighten
me
i
am
trying
to
encourage
you
to
face
your
position
i
am
doing
my
best
mirabel
said
with
sullen
resignation
fortune
has
favored
me
so
far
i
have
really
and
truly
been
unable
to
satisfy
emily
by
discovering
miss
jethro
she
has
left
the
place
at
which
i
saw
her
last
there
is
no
trace
to
be
found
of
her
and
emily
knows
don
t
forget
delvin
replied
that
there
is
a
trace
to
be
found
of
rook
and
that
emily
expects
you
to
follow
mirabel
shuddered
i
am
surrounded
by
dangers
whichever
way
i
look
he
said
do
what
i
may
it
turns
out
to
be
wrong
i
was
wrong
perhaps
when
i
brought
emily
no
i
could
easily
make
an
excuse
mirabel
persisted
and
take
her
back
to
and
for
all
you
know
to
the
contrary
his
wiser
sister
replied
mrs
rook
may
go
to
london
and
you
may
take
emily
back
in
time
to
receive
her
at
the
cottage
in
every
way
you
are
safer
in
my
old
tower
and
don
t
forget
you
have
got
my
money
to
help
you
if
you
want
it
in
my
belief
miles
you
want
you
are
the
dearest
and
best
of
sisters
what
do
you
recommend
me
to
do
what
you
would
have
been
obliged
to
do
delvin
answered
if
you
had
remained
in
london
you
must
go
to
redwood
hall
tomorrow
as
emily
has
arranged
it
if
rook
is
not
there
you
must
ask
for
her
address
in
scotland
if
nobody
knows
the
address
you
must
still
bestir
yourself
in
trying
to
find
it
and
when
you
do
fall
in
with
rook
well
take
care
wherever
it
may
be
that
you
see
her
mirabel
was
alarmed
don
t
keep
me
in
suspense
he
burst
out
tell
me
what
you
never
mind
what
i
propose
before
i
can
tell
you
what
i
have
in
my
mind
i
must
know
whether
rook
is
in
england
or
scotland
bring
me
that
information
and
i
shall
have
something
to
say
to
you
hark
the
wind
is
rising
the
rain
is
falling
there
is
a
chance
of
sleep
for
me
i
shall
soon
hear

dearest
and
thank
you

again
chapter
lix
the
accident
at
belford
early
in
the
morning
mirabel
set
forth
for
redwood
hall
in
one
of
the
vehicles
which
delvin
still
kept
at
the
clink
for
the
convenience
of
visitors
he
returned
soon
after
noon
having
obtained
information
of
the
whereabout
of
rook
and
her
husband
when
they
had
last
been
heard
of
they
were
at
lasswade
near
edinburgh
whether
they
had
or
had
not
obtained
the
situation
of
which
they
were
in
search
neither
miss
redwood
nor
any
one
else
at
the
hall
could
tell
in
half
an
hour
more
another
horse
was
harnessed
and
mirabel
was
on
his
way
to
the
railway
station
at
belford
to
follow
rook
at
emily
s
urgent
request
before
his
departure
he
had
an
interview
with
his
sister
delvin
was
rich
enough
to
believe
implicitly
in
the
power
of
money
her
method
of
extricating
her
brother
from
the
serious
difficulties
that
beset
him
was
to
make
it
worth
the
while
of
and
rook
to
leave
england
their
passage
to
america
would
be
secretly
paid
and
they
would
take
with
them
a
letter
of
credit
addressed
to
a
banker
in
new
york
if
mirabel
failed
to
discover
them
after
they
had
sailed
emily
could
not
blame
his
want
of
devotion
to
her
interests
he
understood
this
but
he
remained
desponding
and
irresolute
even
with
the
money
in
his
hands
the
one
person
who
could
rouse
his
courage
and
animate
his
hope
was
also
the
one
person
who
must
know
nothing
of
what
had
passed
between
his
sister
and
himself
he
had
no
choice
but
to
leave
emily
without
being
cheered
by
her
bright
looks
invigorated
by
her
inspiriting
words
mirabel
went
away
on
his
doubtful
errand
with
a
heavy
heart
the
clink
was
so
far
from
the
nearest
post
town
that
the
few
letters
usually
addressed
to
the
tower
were
delivered
by
private
arrangement
with
a
messenger
the
man
s
punctuality
depended
on
the
convenience
of
his
superiors
employed
at
the
office
sometimes
he
arrived
early
and
sometimes
he
arrived
late
on
this
particular
morning
he
presented
himself
at
half
past
one
o
clock
with
a
letter
for
emily
and
when
ellmother
smartly
reproved
him
for
the
delay
he
coolly
attributed
it
to
the
hospitality
of
friends
whom
he
had
met
on
the
road
the
letter
directed
to
emily
at
the
cottage
had
been
forwarded
from
london
by
the
person
left
in
charge
it
addressed
her
as
honored
she
turned
at
once
to
the
end
and
discovered
the
signature
of
rook
and
mirabel
has
gone
emily
exclaimed
just
when
his
presence
is
of
the
greatest
importance
to
us
shrewd
ellmother
suggested
that
it
might
be
as
well
to
read
the
letter
first
and
then
to
form
an
opinion
emily
read
it
lasswade
near
edinburgh
honored
miss
i
take
up
my
pen
to
bespeak
your
kind
sympathy
for
my
husband
and
myself
two
old
people
thrown
on
the
world
again
by
the
death
of
our
excellent
master
we
are
under
a
month
s
notice
to
leave
redwood
hall
hearing
of
a
situation
at
this
place
also
that
our
expenses
would
be
paid
if
we
applied
personally
we
got
leave
of
absence
and
made
our
application
the
lady
and
her
son
are
either
the
stingiest
people
that
ever
lived
or
they
have
taken
a
dislike
to
me
and
my
husband
and
they
make
money
a
means
of
getting
rid
of
us
easily
suffice
it
to
say
that
we
have
refused
to
accept
starvation
wages
and
that
we
are
still
out
of
place
it
is
just
possible
that
you
may
have
heard
of
something
to
suit
us
so
i
write
at
once
knowing
that
good
chances
are
often
lost
through
needless
delay
we
stop
at
belford
on
our
way
back
to
see
some
friends
of
my
husband
and
we
hope
to
get
to
redwood
hall
in
good
time
on
the
would
you
please
address
me
to
care
of
miss
redwood
in
case
you
know
of
any
good
situation
for
which
we
could
apply
perhaps
we
may
be
driven
to
try
our
luck
in
london
in
this
case
will
you
permit
me
to
have
the
honor
of
presenting
my
respects
as
i
ventured
to
propose
when
i
wrote
to
you
a
little
time
since
i
beg
to
remain
honored
miss
your
humble
servant
r
emily
handed
the
letter
to
ellmother
read
it
she
said
and
tell
me
what
you
i
think
you
had
better
be
careful
of
rook
yes
and
careful
of
delvin
emily
was
astonished
are
you
really
speaking
seriously
she
said
mrs
delvin
is
a
most
interesting
person
so
patient
under
her
sufferings
so
kind
so
clever
so
interested
in
all
that
interests
i
shall
take
the
letter
to
her
at
once
and
ask
her
have
your
own
way
miss
i
can
t
tell
you
why
but
i
don
t
like
her
delvin
s
devotion
to
the
interests
of
her
guest
took
even
emily
by
surprise
after
reading
rook
s
letter
she
rang
the
bell
on
her
table
in
a
frenzy
of
impatience
my
brother
must
be
instantly
recalled
she
said
telegraph
to
him
in
your
own
name
telling
him
what
has
happened
he
will
find
the
message
waiting
for
him
at
the
end
of
his
the
groom
summoned
by
the
bell
was
ordered
to
saddle
the
third
and
last
horse
left
in
the
stables
to
take
the
telegram
to
belford
and
to
wait
there
until
the
answer
arrived
how
far
is
it
to
redwood
hall
emily
asked
when
the
man
had
received
his
orders
ten
miles
delvin
answered
how
can
i
get
there
my
dear
you
can
t
get
pardon
me
delvin
i
must
get
pardon
my
brother
represents
you
in
this
matter
leave
it
to
my
the
tone
taken
by
mirabel
s
sister
was
positive
to
say
the
least
of
it
emily
thought
of
what
her
faithful
old
servant
had
said
and
began
to
doubt
her
own
discretion
in
so
readily
showing
the
letter
the
mistake
if
a
mistake
it
was
had
however
been
committed
and
wrong
or
right
she
was
not
disposed
to
occupy
the
subordinate
position
which
delvin
had
assigned
to
her
if
you
will
look
at
rook
s
letter
again
emily
replied
you
will
see
that
i
ought
to
answer
it
she
supposes
i
am
in
do
you
propose
to
tell
rook
that
you
are
in
this
house
delvin
asked
you
had
better
consult
my
brother
before
you
take
any
responsibility
on
emily
kept
her
temper
allow
me
to
remind
you
she
said
that
mirabel
is
not
acquainted
with
rook
and
that
i
am
if
i
speak
to
her
personally
i
can
do
much
to
assist
the
object
of
our
inquiries
before
he
returns
she
is
not
an
easy
woman
to
deal
with
and
therefore
delvin
interposed
the
sort
of
person
who
requires
careful
handling
by
a
man
like
my
brother
a
man
of
the
the
sort
of
person
as
i
venture
to
think
emily
persisted
whom
i
ought
to
see
with
as
little
loss
of
time
as
delvin
waited
a
while
before
she
replied
in
her
condition
of
health
anxiety
was
not
easy
to
bear
rook
s
letter
and
emily
s
obstinacy
had
seriously
irritated
her
but
like
all
persons
of
ability
she
was
capable
when
there
was
serious
occasion
for
it
of
exerting
she
really
liked
and
admired
emily
and
as
the
elder
woman
and
the
hostess
she
set
an
example
of
forbearance
and
good
humor
it
is
out
of
my
power
to
send
you
to
redwood
hall
at
once
she
resumed
the
only
one
of
my
three
horses
now
at
your
disposal
is
the
horse
which
took
my
brother
to
the
hall
this
morning
a
distance
there
and
back
of
twenty
miles
you
are
not
in
too
great
a
hurry
i
am
sure
to
allow
the
horse
time
to
rest
emily
made
her
excuses
with
perfect
grace
and
sincerity
i
had
no
idea
the
distance
was
so
great
she
confessed
i
will
wait
dear
delvin
as
long
as
you
they
parted
as
good
friends
as
ever
with
a
certain
reserve
nevertheless
on
either
side
emily
s
eager
nature
was
depressed
and
irritated
by
the
prospect
of
delay
delvin
on
the
other
hand
devoted
to
her
brother
s
interests
thought
hopefully
of
obstacles
which
might
present
themselves
with
the
lapse
of
time
the
horse
might
prove
to
be
incapable
of
further
exertion
for
that
day
or
the
threatening
aspect
of
the
weather
might
end
in
a
storm
but
the
hours
passed
and
the
sky
cleared
and
the
horse
was
reported
to
be
fit
for
work
again
fortune
was
against
the
lady
of
the
tower
she
had
no
choice
but
to
submit
delvin
had
just
sent
word
to
emily
that
the
carriage
would
be
ready
for
her
in
ten
minutes
when
the
coachman
who
had
driven
mirabel
to
belford
returned
he
brought
news
which
agreeably
surprised
both
the
ladies
mirabel
had
reached
the
station
five
minutes
too
late
the
coachman
had
left
him
waiting
the
arrival
of
the
next
train
to
the
north
he
would
now
receive
the
telegraphic
message
at
belford
and
might
return
immediately
by
taking
the
groom
s
horse
delvin
left
it
to
emily
to
decide
whether
she
would
proceed
by
herself
to
redwood
hall
or
wait
for
mirabel
s
return
under
the
changed
circumstances
emily
would
have
acted
ungraciously
if
she
had
persisted
in
holding
to
her
first
intention
she
consented
to
wait
the
sea
still
remained
calm
in
the
stillness
of
the
moorland
solitude
on
the
western
side
of
the
clink
the
rapid
steps
of
a
horse
were
heard
at
some
little
distance
on
the
highroad
emily
ran
out
followed
by
careful
ellmother
expecting
to
meet
mirabel
she
was
disappointed
it
was
the
groom
who
had
returned
as
he
pulled
up
at
the
house
and
dismounted
emily
noticed
that
the
man
looked
excited
is
there
anything
wrong
she
asked
there
has
been
an
accident
not
to
mirabel
no
no
miss
an
accident
to
a
poor
foolish
woman
traveling
from
emily
looked
at
ellmother
it
can
t
be
rook
she
said
that
s
the
name
miss
she
got
out
before
the
train
had
quite
stopped
and
fell
on
the
was
she
hurt
seriously
hurt
as
i
heard
they
carried
her
into
a
house
hard
by
and
sent
for
the
was
mirabel
one
of
the
people
who
helped
her
he
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
platform
miss
waiting
for
the
train
from
london
i
got
to
the
station
and
gave
him
the
telegram
just
as
the
accident
took
place
we
crossed
over
to
hear
more
about
it
mirabel
was
telling
me
that
he
would
return
to
the
clink
on
my
horse
when
he
heard
the
woman
s
name
mentioned
upon
that
he
changed
his
mind
and
went
to
the
was
he
let
in
the
doctor
wouldn
t
hear
of
it
he
was
making
his
examination
and
he
said
nobody
was
to
be
in
the
room
but
her
husband
and
the
woman
of
the
is
mirabel
waiting
to
see
her
yes
miss
he
said
he
would
wait
all
day
if
necessary
and
he
gave
me
this
bit
of
a
note
to
take
to
the
emily
turned
to
ellmother
it
s
impossible
to
stay
here
not
knowing
whether
rook
is
going
to
live
or
die
she
said
i
shall
go
to
belford
and
you
will
go
with
the
groom
interfered
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
it
was
mirabel
s
most
particular
wish
that
you
were
not
on
any
account
to
go
to
why
not
he
didn
t
emily
eyed
the
note
in
the
man
s
hand
with
distrust
in
all
probability
mirabel
s
object
in
writing
was
to
instruct
his
sister
to
prevent
her
guest
from
going
to
belford
the
carriage
was
waiting
at
the
door
with
her
usual
promptness
of
resolution
emily
decided
on
taking
it
for
granted
that
she
was
free
to
use
as
she
pleased
a
carriage
which
had
been
already
placed
at
her
disposal
tell
your
mistress
she
said
to
the
groom
that
i
am
going
to
belford
instead
of
to
redwood
in
a
minute
more
she
and
ellmother
were
on
their
way
to
join
mirabel
at
the
station
chapter
lx
outside
the
room
emily
found
mirabel
in
the
waiting
room
at
belford
her
sudden
appearance
might
well
have
amazed
him
but
his
face
expressed
a
more
serious
emotion
than
surprise
he
looked
at
her
as
if
she
had
alarmed
him
didn
t
you
get
my
message
he
asked
i
told
the
groom
i
wished
you
to
wait
for
my
return
i
sent
a
note
to
my
sister
in
case
he
made
any
the
man
made
no
mistake
emily
answered
i
was
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
be
able
to
speak
with
delvin
did
you
really
suppose
i
could
endure
the
suspense
of
waiting
till
you
came
back
do
you
think
i
can
be
of
no
use
i
who
know
rook
they
won
t
let
you
see
why
not
seem
to
be
waiting
to
see
i
am
waiting
for
the
return
of
the
rector
of
belford
he
is
at
berwick
and
he
has
been
sent
for
at
rook
s
urgent
is
she
dying
she
is
in
fear
of
death
whether
rightly
or
wrongly
i
don
t
know
there
is
some
internal
injury
from
the
fall
i
hope
to
see
her
when
the
rector
returns
as
a
brother
clergyman
i
may
with
perfect
propriety
ask
him
to
use
his
influence
in
my
i
am
glad
to
find
you
so
eager
about
i
am
always
eager
in
your
don
t
think
me
ungrateful
emily
replied
gently
i
am
no
stranger
to
rook
and
if
i
send
in
my
name
i
may
be
able
to
see
her
before
the
clergyman
she
stopped
mirabel
suddenly
moved
so
as
to
place
himself
between
her
and
the
door
i
must
really
beg
of
you
to
give
up
that
idea
he
said
you
don
t
know
what
horrid
sight
you
may
see
what
dreadful
agonies
of
pain
this
unhappy
woman
may
be
his
manner
suggested
to
emily
that
he
might
be
acting
under
some
motive
which
he
was
unwilling
to
acknowledge
if
you
have
a
reason
for
wishing
that
i
should
keep
away
from
rook
she
said
let
me
hear
what
it
is
surely
we
trust
each
other
i
have
done
my
best
to
set
the
example
at
any
mirabel
seemed
to
be
at
a
loss
for
a
reply
while
he
was
hesitating
the
passed
the
door
emily
asked
him
to
direct
her
to
the
house
in
which
rook
had
been
received
he
led
the
way
to
the
end
of
the
platform
and
pointed
to
the
house
emily
and
ellmother
immediately
left
the
station
mirabel
accompanied
them
still
remonstrating
still
raising
obstacles
the
house
door
was
opened
by
an
old
man
he
looked
reproachfully
at
mirabel
you
have
been
told
already
he
said
that
no
strangers
are
to
see
my
wife
encouraged
by
discovering
that
the
man
was
rook
emily
mentioned
her
name
perhaps
you
may
have
heard
rook
speak
of
me
she
added
i
ve
heard
her
speak
of
you
what
does
the
doctor
say
he
thinks
she
may
get
over
it
she
doesn
t
believe
will
you
say
that
i
am
anxious
to
see
her
if
she
feels
well
enough
to
receive
me
rook
looked
at
ellmother
are
there
two
of
you
wanting
to
go
upstairs
he
inquired
this
is
my
old
friend
and
servant
emily
answered
she
will
wait
for
me
down
she
can
wait
in
the
parlor
the
good
people
of
this
house
are
well
known
to
he
pointed
to
the
parlor
door
and
then
led
the
way
to
the
first
floor
emily
followed
him
mirabel
as
obstinate
as
ever
followed
emily
rook
opened
a
door
at
the
end
of
the
landing
and
turning
round
to
speak
to
emily
noticed
mirabel
standing
behind
her
without
making
any
remarks
the
old
man
pointed
significantly
down
the
stairs
his
resolution
was
evidently
immovable
mirabel
appealed
to
emily
to
help
him
she
will
see
me
if
ask
her
he
said
let
me
wait
here
the
sound
of
his
voice
was
instantly
followed
by
a
cry
from
the
a
cry
of
terror
rook
hurried
into
the
room
and
closed
the
door
in
less
than
a
minute
he
opened
it
again
with
doubt
and
horror
plainly
visible
in
his
face
he
stepped
up
to
mirabel
eyed
him
with
the
closest
scrutiny
and
drew
back
again
with
a
look
of
relief
she
s
wrong
he
said
you
are
not
the
this
strange
proceeding
startled
emily
what
man
do
you
mean
she
asked
rook
took
no
notice
of
the
question
still
looking
at
mirabel
he
pointed
down
the
stairs
once
more
with
vacant
eyes
moving
mechanically
like
a
in
his
dream
mirabel
silently
obeyed
rook
turned
to
emily
are
you
easily
frightened
he
said
i
don
t
understand
you
emily
replied
who
is
going
to
frighten
me
why
did
you
speak
to
mirabel
in
that
strange
way
rook
looked
toward
the
bedroom
door
maybe
you
ll
hear
why
inside
there
if
i
could
have
my
way
you
shouldn
t
see
her
but
she
s
not
to
be
reasoned
with
a
caution
miss
don
t
be
too
ready
to
believe
what
my
wife
may
say
to
you
she
s
had
a
he
opened
the
door
in
my
belief
he
whispered
she
s
off
her
emily
crossed
the
threshold
rook
softly
closed
the
door
behind
her
chapter
lxi
inside
the
room
a
decent
elderly
woman
was
seated
at
the
bedside
she
rose
and
spoke
to
emily
with
a
mingling
of
sorrow
and
confusion
strikingly
expressed
on
her
face
it
isn
t
my
fault
she
said
that
rook
receives
you
in
this
manner
i
am
obliged
to
humor
she
drew
aside
and
showed
rook
with
her
head
supported
by
many
pillows
and
her
face
strangely
hidden
from
view
under
a
veil
emily
started
back
in
horror
is
her
face
injured
she
asked
rook
answered
the
question
herself
her
voice
was
low
and
weak
but
she
still
spoke
with
the
same
nervous
hurry
of
articulation
which
had
been
remarked
by
alban
morris
on
the
day
when
she
asked
him
to
direct
her
to
netherwoods
not
exactly
injured
she
explained
but
one
s
appearance
is
a
matter
of
some
anxiety
even
on
one
s
i
am
disfigured
by
a
thoughtless
use
of
water
to
bring
me
to
when
i
had
my
fall
and
i
can
t
get
at
my
to
put
myself
right
again
i
don
t
wish
to
shock
you
please
excuse
the
emily
remembered
the
rouge
on
her
cheeks
and
the
dye
on
her
hair
when
they
had
first
seen
each
other
at
the
school
vanity
of
all
human
frailties
the
still
held
its
place
in
this
woman
s
nature
superior
to
torment
of
conscience
unassailable
by
terror
of
death
the
good
woman
of
the
house
waited
a
moment
before
she
left
the
room
what
shall
i
say
she
asked
if
the
clergyman
comes
rook
lifted
her
hand
solemnly
say
she
answered
that
a
dying
sinner
is
making
atonement
for
sin
say
this
young
lady
is
present
by
the
decree
of
an
providence
no
mortal
creature
must
disturb
her
hand
dropped
back
heavily
on
the
bed
are
we
alone
she
asked
we
are
alone
emily
answered
what
made
you
scream
just
before
i
came
in
no
i
can
t
allow
you
to
remind
me
of
that
rook
protested
i
must
compose
myself
be
quiet
let
me
recovering
her
composure
she
also
recovered
that
sense
of
enjoyment
in
talking
of
herself
which
was
one
of
the
marked
peculiarities
in
her
character
you
will
excuse
me
if
i
exhibit
religion
she
resumed
my
dear
parents
were
exemplary
people
i
was
most
carefully
brought
up
are
you
pious
let
us
hope
emily
was
once
more
reminded
of
the
past
the
bygone
time
returned
to
her
memory
the
time
when
she
had
accepted
sir
jervis
redwood
s
offer
of
employment
and
when
rook
had
arrived
at
the
school
to
be
her
traveling
companion
to
the
north
the
wretched
creature
had
entirely
forgotten
her
own
loose
talk
after
she
had
drunk
miss
ladd
s
good
wine
to
the
last
drop
in
the
bottle
as
she
was
boasting
now
of
her
piety
so
she
had
boasted
then
of
her
lost
faith
and
hope
and
had
mockingly
declared
her
opinions
to
be
the
result
of
her
marriage
forgotten
all
forgotten
in
this
later
time
of
pain
and
fear
prostrate
under
the
dread
of
death
her
innermost
nature
stripped
of
the
concealments
of
her
later
life
was
revealed
to
view
the
early
religious
training
at
which
she
had
scoffed
in
the
insolence
of
health
and
strength
revealed
its
latent
influence
intermitted
but
a
living
influence
always
from
first
to
last
rook
was
tenderly
mindful
of
her
exemplary
parents
and
proud
of
exhibiting
religion
on
the
bed
from
which
she
was
never
to
rise
again
did
i
tell
you
that
i
am
a
miserable
sinner
she
asked
after
an
interval
of
silence
emily
could
endure
it
no
longer
say
that
to
the
clergyman
she
answered
not
to
oh
but
i
must
say
it
rook
insisted
i
a
miserable
sinner
let
me
give
you
an
instance
of
it
she
continued
with
a
shameless
relish
of
the
memory
of
her
own
frailties
i
have
been
a
drinker
in
my
time
anything
was
welcome
when
the
fit
was
on
me
as
long
as
it
got
into
my
head
like
other
persons
in
liquor
i
sometimes
talked
of
things
that
had
better
have
been
kept
secret
we
bore
that
in
mind
my
old
man
and
i
we
were
engaged
by
sir
jervis
miss
redwood
wanted
to
put
us
in
the
next
bedroom
to
hers
a
risk
not
to
be
run
i
might
have
talked
of
the
murder
at
the
inn
and
she
might
have
heard
me
please
to
remark
a
curious
thing
whatever
else
i
might
let
out
when
i
was
in
my
cups
not
a
word
about
the
pocketbook
ever
dropped
from
me
you
will
ask
how
i
know
it
my
dear
i
should
have
heard
of
it
from
my
husband
if
i
had
let
out
and
he
is
as
much
in
the
dark
as
you
are
wonderful
are
the
workings
of
the
human
mind
as
the
poet
says
and
drink
drowns
care
as
the
proverb
says
but
can
drink
deliver
a
person
from
fear
by
day
and
fear
by
night
i
believe
if
i
had
dropped
a
word
about
the
pocketbook
it
would
have
sobered
me
in
an
instant
have
you
any
remark
to
make
on
this
curious
circumstance
thus
far
emily
had
allowed
the
woman
to
ramble
on
in
the
hope
of
getting
information
which
direct
inquiry
might
fail
to
produce
it
was
impossible
however
to
pass
over
the
allusion
to
the
pocketbook
after
giving
her
time
to
recover
from
the
exhaustion
which
her
heavy
breathing
sufficiently
revealed
emily
put
the
question
who
did
the
pocketbook
belong
to
wait
a
little
said
rook
everything
in
its
right
place
is
my
motto
i
mustn
t
begin
with
the
pocketbook
why
did
i
begin
with
it
do
you
think
this
veil
on
my
face
confuses
me
suppose

i
have
forgotten
and
after
such
a
fright
as
he
gave
me
did
you
see
him
on
the
landing
who
are
you
talking
of
emily
asked
rook
s
failing
voice
sank
lower
still
come
closer
she
said
this
must
be
whispered
who
am
i
talking
of
she
repeated
i
am
talking
of
the
man
who
slept
in
the
other
bed
at
the
inn
the
man
who
did
the
deed
with
his
own
razor
he
was
gone
when
i
looked
into
the
outhouse
in
the
gray
of
the
morning
oh
i
have
done
my
duty
i
have
told
rook
to
keep
an
eye
on
him
downstairs
you
haven
t
an
idea
how
obstinate
and
stupid
my
husband
is
he
says
i
couldn
t
know
the
man
because
i
didn
t
see
him
ha
there
s
such
a
thing
as
hearing
when
you
don
t
see
i
heard
and
i
knew
it
emily
turned
cold
from
head
to
foot
what
did
you
know
again
she
said
his
voice
rook
answered
i
ll
swear
to
his
voice
before
all
the
judges
in
emily
rushed
to
the
bed
she
looked
at
the
woman
who
had
said
those
dreadful
words
speechless
with
horror
you
re
breaking
your
promise
cried
rook
you
false
girl
you
re
breaking
your
promise
she
snatched
at
the
veil
and
put
it
on
again
the
sight
of
her
face
momentary
as
it
had
been
reassured
emily
her
wild
eyes
made
wilder
still
by
the
blurred
stains
of
rouge
below
them
half
washed
away
her
disheveled
hair
with
streaks
of
gray
showing
through
the
dye
presented
a
spectacle
which
would
have
been
grotesque
under
other
circumstances
but
which
now
reminded
emily
of
rook
s
last
words
warning
her
not
to
believe
what
his
wife
said
and
even
declaring
his
conviction
that
her
intellect
was
deranged
emily
drew
back
from
the
bed
conscious
of
an
overpowering
sense
of
although
it
was
only
for
a
moment
she
had
allowed
her
faith
in
mirabel
to
be
shaken
by
a
woman
who
was
out
of
her
mind
try
to
forgive
me
she
said
i
didn
t
willfully
break
my
promise
you
frightened
rook
began
to
cry
i
was
a
handsome
woman
in
my
time
she
murmured
you
would
say
i
was
handsome
still
if
the
clumsy
fools
about
me
had
not
spoiled
my
appearance
oh
i
do
feel
so
weak
where
s
my
medicine
the
bottle
was
on
the
table
emily
gave
her
the
prescribed
dose
and
revived
her
failing
strength
i
am
an
extraordinary
person
she
resumed
my
resolution
has
always
been
the
admiration
of
every
one
who
knew
me
but
my
mind
feels
how
shall
i
express
it
a
little
vacant
have
mercy
on
my
poor
wicked
soul
help
how
can
i
help
you
i
want
to
recollect
something
happened
in
the
summer
time
when
we
were
talking
at
netherwoods
i
mean
when
that
impudent
master
at
the
school
showed
his
suspicions
of
me
lord
how
he
frightened
me
when
he
turned
up
afterward
at
sir
jervis
s
house
you
must
have
seen
yourself
he
suspected
me
how
did
he
show
it
he
showed
you
my
locket
emily
answered
oh
the
horrid
reminder
of
the
murder
rook
exclaimed
didn
t
mention
it
don
t
blame
me
you
poor
innocent
i
have
something
dreadful
to
tell
emily
s
horror
of
the
woman
forced
her
to
speak
don
t
tell
me
she
cried
i
know
more
than
you
suppose
i
know
what
i
was
ignorant
of
when
you
saw
the
rook
took
offense
at
the
interruption
clever
as
you
are
there
s
one
thing
you
don
t
know
she
said
you
asked
me
just
now
who
the
pocketbook
belonged
to
it
belonged
to
your
father
what
s
the
matter
are
you
crying
emily
was
thinking
of
her
father
the
pocketbook
was
the
last
present
she
had
given
to
him
a
present
on
his
birthday
is
it
lost
she
asked
sadly
no
it
s
not
lost
you
will
hear
more
of
it
directly
dry
your
eyes
and
expect
something
interesting
i
m
going
to
talk
about
love
love
my
dear
means
myself
why
shouldn
t
it
i
m
not
the
only
woman
married
to
an
old
man
who
has
had
a
wretch
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
it
everything
you
rude
girl
my
lover
was
like
the
rest
of
them
he
would
bet
on
and
he
lost
he
owned
it
to
me
on
the
day
when
your
father
came
to
our
inn
he
said
i
must
find
the
money
or
be
off
to
america
and
say
i
was
fool
enough
to
be
fond
of
him
it
broke
my
heart
to
hear
him
talk
in
that
way
i
said
if
i
find
the
money
and
more
than
the
money
will
you
take
me
with
you
wherever
you
go
of
course
he
said
yes
i
suppose
you
have
heard
of
the
inquest
held
at
our
old
place
by
the
coroner
and
jury
oh
what
idiots
they
believed
i
was
asleep
on
the
night
of
the
murder
i
never
closed
my
eyes
i
was
so
miserable
i
was
so
tempted
what
tempted
you
do
you
think
i
had
any
money
to
spare
your
father
s
pocketbook
tempted
me
i
had
seen
him
open
it
to
pay
his
bill
it
was
full
of
oh
what
an
overpowering
thing
love
is
perhaps
you
have
known
it
emily
s
indignation
once
more
got
the
better
of
her
prudence
have
you
no
feeling
of
decency
on
your
she
said
rook
forgot
her
piety
she
was
ready
with
an
impudent
rejoinder
you
little
woman
your
time
will
come
she
answered
but
you
re
right
i
am
wandering
from
the
point
i
am
not
sufficiently
sensible
of
this
solemn
occasion
do
you
notice
my
language
i
inherit
correct
english
from
my
mother
a
cultivated
person
who
married
beneath
her
my
paternal
grandfather
was
a
gentleman
did
i
tell
you
that
there
came
a
time
on
that
dreadful
night
when
i
could
stay
in
bed
no
longer
the
pocketbook
i
did
nothing
but
think
of
that
devilish
pocketbook
full
of
my
husband
was
fast
asleep
all
the
time
i
got
a
chair
and
stood
on
it
i
looked
into
the
place
where
the
two
men
were
sleeping
through
the
glass
in
the
top
of
the
door
your
father
was
awake
he
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
what
do
you
say
was
he
agitated
i
didn
t
notice
i
don
t
know
whether
the
other
man
was
asleep
or
awake
i
saw
nothing
but
the
pocketbook
stuck
under
the
pillow
half
in
and
half
out
your
father
kept
on
walking
up
and
down
i
thought
to
myself
i
ll
wait
till
he
gets
tired
and
then
i
ll
have
another
look
at
the
where
s
the
wine
the
doctor
said
i
might
have
a
glass
of
wine
when
i
wanted
emily
found
the
wine
and
gave
it
to
her
she
shuddered
as
she
accidentally
touched
rook
s
hand
the
wine
helped
the
sinking
woman
i
must
have
got
up
more
than
once
she
resumed
and
more
than
once
my
heart
must
have
failed
me
i
don
t
clearly
remember
what
i
did
till
the
gray
of
the
morning
came
i
think
that
must
have
been
the
last
time
i
looked
through
the
glass
in
the
she
began
to
tremble
she
tore
the
veil
off
her
face
she
cried
out
piteously
lord
be
merciful
to
me
a
sinner
come
here
she
said
to
emily
where
are
you
no
i
daren
t
tell
you
what
i
saw
i
daren
t
tell
you
what
i
did
when
you
re
pos
sessed
by
the
devil
there
s
nothing
nothing
nothing
you
can
t
do
where
did
i
find
the
courage
to
unlock
the
door
where
did
i
find
the
courage
to
go
in
any
other
woman
would
have
lost
her
senses
when
she
found
blood
on
her
fingers
after
taking
the
pocketbook
emily
s
head
swam
her
heart
beat
furiously
she
staggered
to
the
door
and
opened
it
to
escape
from
the
room
i
m
guilty
of
robbing
him
but
i
m
innocent
of
his
blood
rook
called
after
her
wildly
the
deed
was
done
the
yard
door
was
wide
open
and
the
man
was
gone
when
i
looked
in
for
the
last
time
come
back
come
back
emily
looked
round
i
can
t
go
near
you
she
said
faintly
come
near
enough
to
see
she
opened
her
at
the
throat
and
drew
up
a
loop
of
ribbon
over
her
head
the
pocketbook
was
attached
to
the
ribbon
she
held
it
out
your
father
s
book
she
said
won
t
you
take
your
father
s
book
for
a
moment
and
only
for
a
moment
emily
was
repelled
by
the
profanation
associated
with
her
birthday
gift
then
the
loving
remembrance
of
the
dear
hands
that
had
so
often
touched
that
relic
drew
the
faithful
daughter
back
to
the
woman
whom
she
abhorred
her
eyes
rested
tenderly
on
the
book
before
it
had
lain
in
that
guilty
bosom
it
had
been
book
the
beloved
memory
was
all
that
was
left
to
her
now
the
beloved
memory
consecrated
it
to
her
hand
she
took
the
book
open
it
said
rook
there
were
two
in
it

emily
asked

little
i

able
to

toward
restoring
what
i
oh
emily
cried
is
there
some
good
in
this
woman
after
all
there
s
no
good
in
the
woman
rook
answered
desperately
there
s
nothing
but
fear
fear
of
hell
now
fear
of
the
pocketbook
in
the
past
time
twice
i
tried
to
destroy
it
and
twice
it
came
back
to
remind
me
of
the
duty
that
i
owed
to
my
miserable
soul
i
tried
to
throw
it
into
the
fire
it
struck
the
bar
and
fell
back
into
the
fender
at
my
feet
i
went
out
and
cast
it
into
the
well
it
came
back
again
in
the
first
bucket
of
water
that
was
drawn
up
from
that
moment
i
began
to
save
what
i
could

tell

book

a
tongue
and
those
were
the
grand
words

dinned
in
my
ears

and
she
stooped
to
fetch
her
breath
stopped
and
struck
her
bosom
i
hid
it
here
so
that
no
person
should
see
it
and
no
person

it
from
me

on
the
day
when
i
gave
him
the
stolen
money

suspected

took
care
of
his
own
cowardly
self
and
left
me
to
the
hard
mercy
of
the
law

theft
was
found

looked
at

imploringly

away
knowing

more
of
the
murder
than

came
here

door

a
mocking
voice
from
outside

hands
over
her
bosom
with
a
sigh

chapter

downstairs
in
a
moment
more
the
doctor
came
in
a
brisk
smiling
man
smartly
dressed
with
a
flower
in
his
a
stifling
odor
of
musk
filled
the
room
as
he
drew
out
his
handkerchief
with
a
flourish
and
wiped
his
forehead
plenty
of
hard
work
in
my
line
just
now
he
said
hullo
rook
somebody
has
been
allowing
you
to
excite
yourself
i
heard
you
before
i
opened
the
door
have
you
been
encouraging
her
to
talk
he
asked
turning
to
emily
and
shaking
his
finger
at
her
with
an
air
of
facetious
remonstrance
incapable
of
answering
him
forgetful
of
the
ordinary
restraints
of
social
intercourse
with
the
one
doubt
that
preserved
her
belief
in
mirabel
eager
for
confirmation
emily
signed
to
this
stranger
to
follow
her
into
a
corner
of
the
room
out
of
hearing
she
made
no
excuses
she
took
no
notice
of
his
look
of
surprise
one
hope
was
all
she
could
feel
one
word
was
all
she
could
say
after
that
second
assertion
of
mirabel
s
guilt
indicating
rook
by
a
glance
at
the
bed
she
whispered
the
word
mad
flippant
and
familiar
the
doctor
imitated
her
he
too
looked
at
the
bed
no
more
mad
than
you
are
miss
as
i
said
just
now
my
patient
has
been
exciting
herself

daresay
she
has
talked
a
little
wildly
in
consequence
isn
t
a
brain
to
give
way
i
can
tell
you
but
there
s
somebody
else
emily
had
fled
from
the
room
he
had
destroyed
her
last
fragment
of
belief
in
mirabel
s
innocence
she
was
on
the
landing
trying
to
console
herself
when
the
doctor
joined
her
are
you
acquainted
with
the
gentleman
downstairs
he
asked
what
gentleman
i
haven
t
heard
his
name

looks
like
a
clergyman

you
know
him
i
do
know
him

answer
questions

mind

of

the
doctor
returned
to
the
bedroom
emily
heard
ellmother

voice
below
are

the
stairs

was
an
evil
hour
she
said
that
you
insisted
on
going
to
this
place
mirabel
the
sight
of
emily
s
face
suspended
the
next
words
on
her
lips
she
took
the
poor
young
mistress
in
her
motherly
arms

down
in
a
corner
in
a
dazed
state
as
i
thought

and
clapped

heart

it
your
wife
s
frightening
her
he
says
your
wife
s
telling
her
horrible
things
about
he
was
taken
on
a
sudden
with
a
shivering
fit
his
eyes
rolled
and
his
teeth
chattered
rook
made
matters
worse
he
lost
his
temper
i
m
damned
he
says
if
i
don
t
begin
to
think
you
the
man
after
all
i
ve
half
a
mind
to
send
for
the
mirabel
dropped
into
his
chair
his
eyes
stared
his
mouth
fell
open
i
took
hold
of
his
hand
cold
cold
as
ice
what
it
all
meant
i
can
t
say
oh
miss
know
let
me
tell
you
the
rest
of
it
some
other
emily
insisted
on
hearing
more
the
end
she
cried
how
did
it
end
i
don
t
know
how
it
might
have
ended
if
the
doctor
hadn
t
come
in
to
pay
his
visit
you
know
upstairs
he
said
some
learned
words
when
he
came
to
plain
english
he
asked
if
anybody
had
frightened
the
gentleman
i
said
rook
had
frightened
him
the
doctor
says
to
rook
mind
what
you
are
about
if
you
frighten
him
again
you
may
have
his
death
to
answer
that
cowed
rook
he
asked
what
he
had
better
do
give
me
some
brandy
for
him
first
says
the
doctor
and
then
get
him
home
at
i
found
the
brandy
and
went
away
to
the
inn
to
order
the
carriage
your
ears
are
quicker
than
mine
miss
do
i
hear
it
now
they
rose
and
went
to
the
house
door
the
carriage
was
there
still
cowed
by
what
the
doctor
had
said
rook
appeared
carefully
leading
mirabel
out
he
had
revived
under
the
action
of
the
stimulant
passing
emily
he
raised
his
eyes
to
her
trembled
and
looked
down
again
when
rook
opened
the
door
of
the
carriage
he
paused
with
one
of
his
feet
on
the
step
a
momentary
impulse
inspired
him
with
a
false
courage
and
brought
a
flush
into
his
ghastly
face
he
turned
to
emily
may
i
speak
to
you
he
asked
she
started
back
from
him
he
looked
at
ellmother
tell
her
i
am
innocent
he
said
the
trembling
seized
on
him
again
rook
was
obliged
to
lift
him
into
the
carriage
emily
caught
at
ellmother
s
arm
you
go
with
him
she
said
i
can
how
are
you
to
get
back
miss
she
turned
away
and
spoke
to
the
coachman
i
am
not
very
well
i
want
the
fresh
air
i
ll
sit
by
ellmother
remonstrated
and
protested
in
vain
as
emily
had
determined
it
should
be
so
it
was
has
he
said
anything
she
asked
when
they
had
arrived
at
their
journey
s
end
he
has
been
like
a
man
frozen
up
he
hasn
t
said
a
word
he
hasn
t
even
take
him
to
his
sister
and
tell
her
all
that
you
know
be
careful
to
repeat
what
the
doctor
said
i
can
t
face
delvin
be
patient
my
good
old
friend
i
have
no
secrets
from
you
only
wait
till
and
leave
me
by
myself
alone
in
her
room
emily
opened
her
searching
among
the
letters
in
it
she
drew
out
a
printed
paper
it
was
the
handbill
describing
the
man
who
had
escaped
from
the
inn
and
offering
a
reward
for
the
discovery
of
him
at
the
first
line
of
the
personal
description
of
the
fugitive
the
paper
dropped
from
her
hand
burning
tears
forced
their
way
into
her
eyes
feeling
for
her
handkerchief
she
touched
the
pocketbook
which
she
had
received
from
rook
after
a
little
hesitation
she
took
it
out
she
looked
at
it
she
opened
it
the
sight
of
the
repelled
her
she
hid
them
in
one
of
the
pockets
of
the
book
there
was
a
second
pocket
which
she
had
not
yet
examined
she
pat
her
hand
into
it
and
touching
something
drew
out
a
letter
the
envelope
already
open
was
addressed
to
james
brown
post
office
would
it
be
inconsistent
with
her
respect
for
her
father
s
memory
to
examine
the
letter
no
a
glance
would
decide
whether
she
ought
to
read
it
or
not
it
was
without
date
or
address
a
startling
letter
to
look
at
for
it
only
contained
three
words
i
say
the
words
were
signed
in
initials
s
in
the
instant
when
she
read
the
initials
the
name
occurred
to
her
sara
jethro
chapter
lxiii
the
defense
of
mirabel
the
discovery
of
the
letter
gave
a
new
direction
to
emily
s
thoughts
and
so
for
the
time
at
least
relieved
her
mind
from
the
burden
that
weighed
on
it
to
what
question
on
her
father
s
part
had
i
say
no
been
miss
jethro
s
brief
and
stern
reply
neither
letter
nor
envelope
offered
the
slightest
hint
that
might
assist
inquiry
even
the
postmark
had
been
so
carelessly
impressed
that
it
was
illegible
emily
was
still
pondering
over
the
three
mysterious
words
when
she
was
interrupted
by
ellmother
s
voice
at
the
door
i
must
ask
you
to
let
me
come
in
miss
though
i
know
you
wished
to
be
left
by
yourself
till
delvin
says
she
must
positively
see
you
it
s
my
belief
that
she
will
send
for
the
servants
and
have
herself
carried
in
here
if
you
refuse
to
do
what
she
asks
you
needn
t
be
afraid
of
seeing
where
is
he
his
sister
has
given
up
her
bedroom
to
him
ellmother
answered
she
thought
of
your
feelings
before
she
sent
me
here
and
had
the
curtains
closed
between
the
and
the
bedroom
i
suspect
my
nasty
temper
misled
me
when
i
took
a
dislike
to
delvin
she
s
a
good
creature
i
m
sorry
you
didn
t
go
to
her
as
soon
as
we
got
did
she
seem
to
be
angry
when
she
sent
you
here
angry
she
was
crying
when
i
left
emily
hesitated
no
longer
she
noticed
a
remarkable
change
in
the
invalid
s
so
brilliantly
lighted
on
other
occasions
the
moment
she
entered
it
the
lamps
were
shaded
and
the
candles
were
all
extinguished
my
eyes
don
t
bear
the
light
so
well
as
usual
delvin
said
come
and
sit
near
me
emily
i
hope
to
quiet
your
mind
i
should
be
grieved
if
you
left
my
house
with
a
wrong
impression
of
knowing
what
she
knew
suffering
as
she
must
have
suffered
the
quiet
kindness
of
her
tone
implied
an
exercise
of
which
appealed
irresistibly
to
emily
s
sympathies
forgive
me
she
said
for
having
done
you
an
injustice
i
am
ashamed
to
think
that
i
shrank
from
seeing
you
when
i
returned
from
i
will
endeavor
to
be
worthy
of
your
better
opinion
of
me
delvin
replied
in
one
respect
at
least
i
may
claim
to
have
had
your
best
interests
at
heart
while
we
were
still
personally
strangers
i
tried
to
prevail
on
my
poor
brother
to
own
the
truth
when
he
discovered
the
terrible
position
in
which
he
was
placed
toward
you
he
was
too
conscious
of
the
absence
of
any
proof
which
might
induce
you
to
believe
him
if
he
attempted
to
defend
himself
in
one
word
he
was
too
timid
to
take
my
advice
he
has
paid
the
penalty
and
i
have
paid
the
penalty
of
deceiving
emily
started
in
what
way
have
you
deceived
me
she
asked
in
the
way
that
was
forced
on
us
by
our
own
conduct
delvin
said
we
have
appeared
to
help
you
without
really
doing
so
we
calculated
on
inducing
you
to
marry
my
brother
and
then
when
he
could
speak
with
the
authority
of
a
husband
on
prevailing
on
you
to
give
up
all
further
inquiries
when
you
insisted
on
seeing
rook
miles
had
the
money
in
his
hand
to
bribe
her
and
her
husband
to
leave
oh
delvin
i
don
t
attempt
to
excuse
myself
i
don
t
expect
you
to
consider
how
sorely
i
was
tempted
to
secure
the
happiness
of
my
brother
s
life
by
marriage
with
such
a
woman
as
yourself
i
don
t
remind
you
that
i
knew
when
i
put
obstacles
in
your
way
that
you
were
blindly
devoting
yourself
to
the
discovery
of
an
innocent
emily
heard
her
with
angry
surprise
innocent
she
repeated
mrs
rook
recognized
his
voice
the
instant
she
heard
him
impenetrable
to
interruption
delvin
went
on
but
what
i
do
ask
she
persisted
even
after
our
short
acquaintance
is
this
do
you
suspect
me
of
deliberately
scheming
to
make
you
the
wife
of
a
murderer
emily
had
never
viewed
the
serious
question
between
them
in
this
light
warmly
generously
she
answered
the
appeal
that
had
been
made
to
her
oh
don
t
think
that
of
me
i
know
i
spoke
thoughtlessly
and
cruelly
to
you
just
now
you
spoke
impulsively
delvin
interposed
that
was
all
my
one
desire
before
we
part
how
can
i
expect
you
to
remain
here
after
what
has
happened
is
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
have
no
interested
object
in
view
for
all
hope
of
your
marriage
with
my
brother
is
now
at
an
end
may
i
ask
if
you
have
heard
that
he
and
your
father
were
strangers
when
they
met
at
the
inn
yes
i
know
if
there
had
been
any
conversation
between
them
when
they
retired
to
rest
they
might
have
mentioned
their
names
but
your
father
was
preoccupied
and
my
brother
after
a
long
day
s
walk
was
so
tired
that
he
fell
asleep
as
soon
as
his
head
was
on
the
pillow
he
only
woke
when
the
morning
dawned
what
he
saw
when
he
looked
toward
the
opposite
bed
might
have
struck
with
terror
the
boldest
man
that
ever
lived
his
first
impulse
was
naturally
to
alarm
the
house
when
he
got
on
his
feet
he
saw
his
own
razor
a
razor
on
the
bed
by
the
side
of
the
corpse
at
that
discovery
he
lost
all
control
over
himself
in
a
panic
of
terror
he
snatched
up
his
knapsack
unfastened
the
yard
door
and
fled
from
the
house
knowing
him
as
you
and
i
know
him
can
we
wonder
at
it
many
a
man
has
been
hanged
for
murder
on
circumstantial
evidence
less
direct
than
the
evidence
against
poor
miles
his
horror
of
his
own
recollections
was
so
overpowering
that
he
forbade
me
even
to
mention
the
inn
at
zeeland
in
my
letters
while
he
was
abroad
never
tell
me
he
wrote
who
that
wretched
murdered
stranger
was
if
i
only
heard
of
his
name
i
believe
it
would
haunt
me
to
my
dying
day
i
ought
not
to
trouble
you
with
these
details
and
yet
i
am
surely
not
without
excuse
in
the
absence
of
any
proof
i
can
not
expect
you
to
believe
as
i
do
in
my
brother
s
innocence
but
i
may
at
least
hope
to
show
you
that
there
is
some
reason
for
doubt
will
you
give
him
the
benefit
of
that
doubt
willingly
emily
replied
am
i
right
in
supposing
that
you
don
t
despair
of
proving
his
innocence
even
yet
i
don
t
quite
despair
but
my
hopes
have
grown
fainter
and
fainter
as
the
years
have
gone
on
there
is
a
person
associated
with
his
escape
from
zeeland
a
person
named
jethro
you
mean
miss
jethro
yes
do
you
know
her
i
know
her
and
my
father
knew
her
i
have
found
a
letter
addressed
to
him
which
i
have
no
doubt
was
written
by
miss
jethro
it
is
barely
possible
that
you
may
understand
what
it
means
pray
look
at
i
am
quite
unable
to
help
you
delvin
answered
after
reading
the
letter
all
i
know
of
miss
jethro
is
that
but
for
her
interposition
my
brother
might
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
police
she
saved
knowing
him
of
course
that
is
the
remarkable
part
of
it
they
were
perfect
strangers
to
each
but
she
must
have
had
some
is
the
foundation
of
my
hope
for
miles
miss
jethro
declared
when
i
wrote
and
put
the
question
to
her
that
the
one
motive
by
which
she
was
actuated
was
the
motive
of
mercy
i
don
t
believe
her
to
my
mind
it
is
in
the
last
degree
improbable
that
she
would
consent
to
protect
a
stranger
from
discovery
who
owned
to
her
as
my
brother
did
that
he
was
a
fugitive
suspected
of
murder
she
knows
something
i
am
firmly
convinced
of
that
dreadful
event
at
zeeland
and
she
has
some
reason
for
keeping
it
secret
have
you
any
influence
over
her
tell
me
where
i
can
find
i
can
t
tell
you
she
has
removed
from
the
address
at
which
my
brother
saw
her
last
he
has
made
every
possible
inquiry
without
as
she
replied
in
those
discouraging
terms
the
curtains
which
divided
delvin
s
bedroom
from
her
were
drawn
aside
an
elderly
approached
her
mistress
s
couch
mr
mirabel
is
awake
ma
am
he
is
very
low
i
can
hardly
feel
his
pulse
shall
i
give
him
some
more
brandy
delvin
held
out
her
hand
to
emily
come
to
me
morning
she
said
and
signed
to
the
servant
to
wheel
her
couch
into
the
next
room
as
the
curtain
closed
over
them
emily
heard
mirabel
s
voice
where
am
i
he
said
faintly
is
it
all
a
dream
the
prospect
of
his
recovery
the
next
morning
was
gloomy
indeed
he
had
sunk
into
a
state
of
deplorable
weakness
in
mind
as
well
as
in
body
the
little
memory
of
events
that
he
still
preserved
was
regarded
by
him
as
the
memory
of
a
dream
he
alluded
to
emily
and
to
his
meeting
with
her
unexpectedly
but
from
that
point
his
recollection
failed
him
they
had
talked
of
something
interesting
he
said
but
he
was
unable
to
remember
what
it
was
and
they
had
waited
together
at
a
railway
station
but
for
what
purpose
he
could
not
tell
he
sighed
and
wondered
when
emily
would
marry
him
and
so
fell
asleep
again
weaker
than
ever
not
having
any
confidence
in
the
doctor
at
belford
delvin
had
sent
an
urgent
message
to
a
physician
at
edinburgh
famous
for
his
skill
in
treating
diseases
of
the
nervous
system
i
can
not
expect
him
to
reach
this
remote
place
without
some
delay
she
said
i
must
bear
my
suspense
as
well
as
i
you
shall
not
bear
it
alone
emily
answered
i
will
wait
with
you
till
the
doctor
delvin
lifted
her
frail
wasted
hands
to
emily
s
face
drew
it
a
little
nearer
and
kissed
her
chapter
lxiv
on
the
way
to
london
the
parting
words
had
been
spoken
emily
and
her
companion
were
on
their
way
to
london
for
some
little
time
they
traveled
in
silence
alone
in
the
railway
carriage
after
submitting
as
long
as
she
could
to
lay
an
embargo
on
the
use
of
her
tongue
ellmother
started
the
conversation
by
means
of
a
question
do
you
think
mirabel
will
get
over
it
miss
it
s
useless
to
ask
me
emily
said
even
the
great
man
from
edinburgh
is
not
able
to
decide
yet
whether
he
will
recover
or
you
have
taken
me
into
your
confidence
miss
emily
as
you
promised
and
i
have
got
something
in
my
mind
in
consequence
may
i
mention
it
without
giving
offense
what
is
it
i
wish
you
had
never
taken
up
with
emily
was
silent
ellmother
having
a
design
of
her
own
to
accomplish
ventured
to
speak
more
plainly
i
often
think
of
alban
morris
she
proceeded
i
always
did
like
him
and
i
always
emily
suddenly
pulled
down
her
veil
don
t
speak
of
him
she
said
i
didn
t
mean
to
offend
you
don
t
offend
me
you
distress
me
oh
how
often
i
have
wished
she
threw
herself
back
in
a
corner
of
the
carriage
and
said
no
more
although
not
remarkable
for
the
possession
of
delicate
tact
ellmother
discovered
that
the
best
course
she
could
now
follow
was
a
course
of
silence
even
at
the
time
when
she
had
most
implicitly
trusted
mirabel
the
fear
that
she
might
have
acted
hastily
and
harshly
toward
alban
had
occasionally
troubled
emily
s
mind
the
impression
produced
by
later
events
had
not
only
intensified
this
feeling
but
had
presented
the
motives
of
that
true
friend
under
an
entirely
new
point
of
view
if
she
had
been
left
in
ignorance
of
the
manner
of
her
father
s
death
as
alban
had
designed
to
leave
her
as
she
would
have
been
left
but
for
the
treachery
of
francine
how
happily
free
she
would
have
been
from
thoughts
which
it
was
now
a
terror
to
her
to
recall
she
would
have
parted
from
mirabel
when
the
visit
to
the
pleasant
country
house
had
come
to
an
end
remembering
him
as
an
amusing
acquaintance
and
nothing
more
he
would
have
been
spared
and
she
would
have
been
spared
the
shock
that
had
so
cruelly
assailed
them
both
what
had
she
gained
by
rook
s
detestable
confession
the
result
had
been
perpetual
disturbance
of
mind
provoked
by
speculations
on
the
subject
of
the
murder
if
mirabel
was
innocent
who
was
guilty
the
false
wife
without
pity
and
without
shame
or
the
brutal
husband
who
looked
capable
of
any
enormity
what
was
her
future
to
be
how
was
it
all
to
end
in
the
despair
of
that
bitter
moment
seeing
her
devoted
old
servant
looking
at
her
with
kind
compassionate
eyes
emily
s
troubled
spirit
sought
refuge
in
impetuous
the
very
betrayal
which
she
had
resolved
should
not
escape
her
hardly
a
minute
since
she
bent
forward
out
of
her
corner
and
suddenly
drew
up
her
veil
do
you
expect
to
see
alban
morris
when
we
get
back
she
asked
i
should
like
to
see
him
miss
if
you
have
no
tell
him
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
and
say
i
ask
his
pardon
with
all
my
heart
the
lord
be
praised
ellmother
burst
out
and
then
when
it
was
too
late
remembered
the
conventional
restraints
appropriate
to
the
occasion
gracious
what
a
fool
i
am
she
said
to
herself
beautiful
weather
miss
emily
isn
t
it
she
continued
in
a
desperate
hurry
to
change
the
subject
emily
reclined
again
in
her
corner
of
the
carriage
she
smiled
for
the
first
time
since
she
had
become
delvin
s
guest
at
the
tower
book
the
last
at
home
again
chapter
lxv
cecilia
in
a
new
character
reaching
the
cottage
at
night
emily
found
the
card
of
a
visitor
who
had
called
during
the
day
it
bore
the
name
of
miss
wyvil
and
had
a
message
written
on
it
which
strongly
excited
emily
s
curiosity
i
have
seen
the
telegram
which
tells
your
servant
that
you
return
expect
me
early
morning
with
news
that
will
deeply
interest
to
what
news
did
cecilia
allude
emily
questioned
the
woman
who
had
been
left
in
charge
of
the
cottage
and
found
that
she
had
next
to
nothing
to
tell
miss
wyvil
had
flushed
up
and
had
looked
excited
when
she
read
the
telegraphic
message
that
was
all
emily
s
impatience
was
as
usual
not
to
be
concealed
expert
ellmother
treated
the
case
in
the
right
way
first
with
supper
and
then
with
an
adjournment
to
bed
the
clock
struck
twelve
when
she
put
out
the
young
mistress
s
candle
ten
hours
to
pass
before
cecilia
comes
here
emily
exclaimed
not
ten
minutes
ellmother
reminded
her
if
you
will
only
go
to
cecilia
arrived
before
the
was
cleared
as
lovely
as
gentle
as
affectionate
as
ever
but
looking
unusually
serious
and
subdued
out
with
it
at
once
emily
cried
what
have
you
got
to
tell
me
perhaps
i
had
better
tell
you
first
cecilia
said
that
i
know
what
you
kept
from
me
when
i
came
here
after
you
left
us
at
monksmoor
don
t
think
my
dear
that
i
say
this
by
way
of
complaint
alban
morris
says
you
had
good
reasons
for
keeping
your
mr
alban
morris
did
you
get
your
information
from
yes
do
i
surprise
you
more
than
words
can
tell
can
you
bear
another
surprise
morris
has
seen
miss
jethro
and
has
discovered
that
mirabel
has
been
wrongly
suspected
of
a
dreadful
crime
our
amiable
little
clergyman
is
guilty
of
being
a
coward
and
guilty
of
nothing
else
are
you
really
quiet
enough
to
read
about
it
she
produced
some
leaves
of
paper
filled
with
writing
there
she
explained
is
morris
s
own
account
of
all
that
passed
between
miss
jethro
and
but
how
do
come
by
it
mr
morris
gave
it
to
me
he
said
show
it
to
emily
as
soon
as
possible
and
take
care
to
be
with
her
while
she
reads
there
is
a
reason
for
this
cecilia
s
voice
faltered
on
the
brink
of
some
explanation
she
seemed
to
recoil
from
it
i
will
tell
you
what
the
reason
is
she
said
emily
looked
nervously
at
the
manuscript
why
doesn
t
he
tell
me
himself
what
he
has
discovered
is
he
the
leaves
began
to
flutter
in
her
trembling
fingers
is
he
angry
with
me
oh
emily
angry
with
you
read
what
he
has
written
and
you
shall
know
why
he
keeps
emily
opened
the
manuscript
chapter
lxvi
alban
s
narrative
the
information
which
i
have
obtained
from
miss
jethro
has
been
communicated
to
me
on
the
condition
that
i
shall
not
disclose
the
place
of
her
residence
let
me
pass
out
of
notice
she
said
as
completely
as
if
i
had
passed
out
of
life
i
wish
to
be
forgotten
by
some
and
to
be
unknown
by
with
this
one
stipulation
she
left
me
free
to
write
the
present
narrative
of
what
passed
at
the
interview
between
us
i
feel
that
the
discoveries
which
i
have
made
are
too
important
to
the
persons
interested
to
be
trusted
to
memory
receives
finding
miss
jethro
s
place
of
abode
with
far
less
difficulty
than
i
had
anticipated
thanks
to
favoring
circumstances
i
stated
plainly
the
object
of
my
visit
she
declined
to
enter
into
conversation
with
me
on
the
subject
of
the
murder
at
zeeland
i
was
prepared
to
meet
with
this
rebuke
and
to
take
the
necessary
measures
for
obtaining
a
more
satisfactory
reception
a
person
is
suspected
of
having
committed
the
murder
i
said
and
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
you
are
in
a
position
to
say
whether
the
suspicion
is
justified
or
not
do
you
refuse
to
answer
me
if
i
put
the
question
miss
jethro
asked
who
the
person
was
i
mentioned
the
name
mr
miles
mirabel
it
is
not
necessary
and
it
would
certainly
be
not
agreeable
to
me
to
describe
the
effect
which
this
reply
produced
on
miss
jethro
after
giving
her
time
to
compose
herself
i
entered
into
certain
explanations
in
order
to
convince
her
at
the
outset
of
my
good
faith
the
result
justified
my
anticipations
i
was
at
once
admitted
to
her
confidence
she
said
i
must
not
hesitate
to
do
an
act
of
justice
to
an
innocent
man
but
in
such
a
serious
matter
as
this
you
have
a
right
to
judge
for
yourself
whether
the
person
who
is
now
speaking
to
you
is
a
person
whom
you
can
trust
you
may
believe
that
i
tell
the
truth
about
others
if
i
begin
whatever
it
may
cost
me
by
telling
the
truth
about
speaks
of
i
shall
not
attempt
to
place
on
record
the
confession
of
a
most
unhappy
woman
it
was
the
common
story
of
sin
bitterly
repented
and
of
vain
effort
to
recover
the
lost
place
in
social
esteem
too
well
known
a
story
surely
to
be
told
again
but
i
may
with
perfect
propriety
repeat
what
miss
jethro
said
to
me
in
allusion
to
later
events
in
her
life
which
are
connected
with
my
own
personal
experience
she
recalled
to
my
memory
a
visit
which
she
had
paid
to
me
at
netherwoods
and
a
letter
addressed
to
her
by
doctor
allday
which
i
had
read
at
her
express
request
she
said
you
may
remember
that
the
letter
contained
some
severe
reflections
on
my
conduct
among
other
things
the
doctor
mentions
that
he
called
at
the
lodging
i
occupied
during
my
visit
to
london
and
found
i
had
taken
to
flight
also
that
he
had
reason
to
believe
i
had
entered
miss
ladd
s
service
under
false
i
asked
if
the
doctor
had
wronged
her
she
answered
no
in
one
case
he
is
ignorant
in
the
other
he
is
right
on
leaving
his
house
i
found
myself
followed
in
the
street
by
the
man
to
whom
i
owe
the
shame
and
misery
of
my
past
life
my
horror
of
him
is
not
to
be
described
in
words
the
one
way
of
escaping
was
offered
by
an
empty
cab
that
passed
me
i
reached
the
railway
station
safely
and
went
back
to
my
home
in
the
country
do
you
blame
me
it
was
impossible
to
blame
her
and
i
said
so
she
then
confessed
the
deception
which
she
had
practiced
on
miss
ladd
i
have
a
cousin
she
said
who
was
a
miss
jethro
like
me
before
her
marriage
she
had
been
employed
as
a
governess
she
pitied
me
she
sympathized
with
my
longing
to
recover
the
character
that
i
had
lost
with
her
permission
i
made
use
of
the
testimonials
which
she
had
earned
as
a
teacher
i
was
betrayed
to
this
day
i
don
t
know
by
whom
and
i
was
dismissed
from
netherwoods
now
you
know
that
i
deceived
miss
ladd
you
may
reasonably
conclude
that
i
am
likely
to
deceive
i
assured
her
with
perfect
sincerity
that
i
had
drawn
no
such
conclusion
encouraged
by
my
reply
miss
jethro
proceeded
as
speaks
of
four
years
ago
i
was
living
near
cowes
in
the
isle
of
wight
in
a
cottage
which
had
been
taken
for
me
by
a
gentleman
who
was
the
owner
of
a
yacht
we
had
just
returned
from
a
short
cruise
and
the
vessel
was
under
orders
to
sail
for
cherbourg
with
the
next
tide
while
i
was
walking
in
my
garden
i
was
startled
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
man
evidently
a
gentleman
who
was
a
perfect
stranger
to
me
he
was
in
a
pitiable
state
of
terror
and
he
implored
my
protection
in
reply
to
my
first
inquiries
he
mentioned
the
inn
at
zeeland
and
the
dreadful
death
of
a
person
unknown
to
him
whom
i
recognized
partly
by
the
description
given
and
partly
by
comparison
of
dates
as
james
brown
i
shall
say
nothing
of
the
shock
inflicted
on
me
you
don
t
want
to
know
what
i
felt
what
i
did
having
literally
only
a
minute
left
for
decision
was
to
hide
the
fugitive
from
discovery
and
to
exert
my
influence
in
his
favor
with
the
owner
of
the
yacht
i
saw
nothing
more
of
him
he
was
put
on
board
as
soon
as
the
police
were
out
of
sight
and
was
safely
landed
at
i
asked
what
induced
her
to
run
the
risk
of
protecting
a
stranger
who
was
under
suspicion
of
having
committed
a
murder
she
said
you
shall
hear
my
explanation
directly
let
us
have
done
with
mirabel
first
we
occasionally
corresponded
during
the
long
absence
on
the
continent
never
alluding
at
his
express
request
to
the
horrible
event
at
the
inn
his
last
letter
reached
me
after
he
had
established
himself
at
vale
regis
writing
of
the
society
in
the
neighborhood
he
informed
me
of
his
introduction
to
miss
wyvil
and
of
the
invitation
that
he
had
received
to
meet
her
friend
and
schoolfellow
at
monksmoor
i
knew
that
miss
emily
possessed
a
handbill
describing
personal
peculiarities
in
mirabel
not
hidden
under
the
changed
appearance
of
his
head
and
face
if
she
remembered
or
happened
to
refer
to
that
description
while
she
was
living
in
the
same
house
with
him
there
was
a
possibility
at
least
of
her
suspicion
being
excited
the
fear
of
this
took
me
to
you
it
was
a
morbid
fear
and
as
events
turned
out
an
unfounded
fear
but
i
was
unable
to
control
it
failing
to
produce
any
effect
on
you
i
went
to
vale
regis
and
tried
vainly
again
to
induce
mirabel
to
send
an
excuse
to
monksmoor
he
like
you
wanted
to
know
what
my
motive
was
when
i
tell
you
that
i
acted
solely
in
miss
emily
s
interests
and
that
i
knew
how
she
had
been
deceived
about
her
father
s
death
need
i
say
why
i
was
afraid
to
acknowledge
my
motive
i
understood
that
miss
jethro
might
well
be
afraid
of
the
consequences
if
she
risked
any
allusion
to
brown
s
horrible
death
and
if
it
afterward
chanced
to
reach
his
daughter
s
ears
but
this
state
of
feeling
implied
an
extraordinary
interest
in
the
preservation
of
emily
s
peace
of
mind
i
asked
miss
jethro
how
that
interest
had
been
excited
she
answered
i
can
only
satisfy
you
in
one
way
i
must
speak
of
her
father
emily
looked
up
from
the
manuscript
she
felt
cecilia
s
arm
tenderly
caressing
her
she
heard
cecilia
say
my
poor
dear
there
is
one
last
trial
of
your
courage
still
to
come
i
am
afraid
of
what
you
are
going
to
read
when
you
turn
to
the
next
page
and
yet
and
yet
emily
replied
gently
it
must
be
done
i
have
learned
my
hard
lesson
of
endurance
cecilia
don
t
be
emily
turned
to
the
next
page
speaks
of
the
for
the
first
time
miss
jethro
appeared
to
be
at
a
loss
how
to
proceed
i
could
see
that
she
was
suffering
she
rose
and
opening
a
drawer
in
her
writing
table
took
a
letter
from
it
she
said
will
you
read
this
it
was
written
by
miss
emily
s
father
perhaps
it
may
say
more
for
me
than
i
can
say
for
myself
i
copy
the
letter
it
was
thus
expressed
you
have
declared
that
our
farewell
is
our
farewell
forever
for
the
second
time
you
have
refused
to
be
my
wife
and
you
have
done
this
to
use
your
own
words
in
mercy
to
me
in
mercy
to
me
i
implore
you
to
reconsider
your
decision
if
you
condemn
me
to
live
without
you
i
feel
it
i
know
it
you
condemn
me
to
despair
which
i
have
not
fortitude
enough
to
endure
look
at
the
passages
which
i
have
marked
for
you
in
the
new
testament
again
and
again
i
say
it
your
true
repentance
has
made
you
worthy
of
the
pardon
of
god
are
you
not
worthy
of
the
love
admiration
and
respect
of
man
think
oh
sara
think
of
what
our
lives
might
be
and
let
them
be
united
for
time
and
for
eternity
i
can
write
no
more
a
deadly
faintness
oppresses
me
my
mind
is
in
a
state
unknown
to
me
in
past
years
i
am
in
such
confusion
that
i
sometimes
think
i
hate
you
and
then
i
recover
from
my
delusion
and
know
that
man
never
loved
woman
as
i
love
you
you
will
have
time
to
write
to
me
by
this
evening
s
post
i
shall
stop
at
zeeland
on
my
way
back
and
ask
for
a
letter
at
the
post
office
i
forbid
explanations
and
excuses
i
forbid
heartless
allusions
to
your
duty
let
me
have
an
answer
which
does
not
keep
me
for
a
moment
in
suspense
for
the
last
time
i
ask
you
do
you
consent
to
be
my
wife
say
yes
or
say
i
gave
her
back
the
letter
with
the
one
comment
on
it
which
the
circumstances
permitted
me
to
make
you
said
no
she
bent
her
head
in
silence
i
went
on
not
willingly
for
i
would
have
spared
her
if
it
had
been
possible
i
said
he
died
despairing
by
his
own
hand
and
you
knew
it
she
looked
up
no
to
say
that
i
knew
it
is
too
much
to
say
that
i
feared
it
is
the
did
you
love
him
she
eyed
me
in
stern
surprise
have
any
right
to
love
could
i
disgrace
an
honorable
man
by
allowing
him
to
marry
me
you
look
as
if
you
held
me
responsible
for
his
innocently
responsible
i
said
she
still
followed
her
own
train
of
thought
do
you
suppose
i
could
for
a
moment
anticipate
that
he
would
destroy
himself
when
i
wrote
my
reply
he
was
a
truly
religious
man
if
he
had
been
in
his
right
mind
he
would
have
shrunk
from
the
idea
of
suicide
as
from
the
idea
of
a
on
reflection
i
was
inclined
to
agree
with
her
in
his
terrible
position
it
was
at
least
possible
that
the
sight
of
the
razor
placed
ready
with
the
other
appliances
of
the
toilet
for
his
s
use
might
have
fatally
tempted
a
man
whose
last
hope
was
crushed
whose
mind
was
tortured
by
despair
i
should
have
been
merciless
indeed
if
i
had
held
miss
jethro
accountable
thus
far
but
i
found
it
hard
to
sympathize
with
the
course
which
she
had
pursued
in
permitting
brown
s
death
to
be
attributed
to
murder
without
a
word
of
protest
why
were
you
silent
i
said
she
smiled
bitterly
a
woman
would
have
known
why
without
asking
she
replied
a
woman
would
have
understood
that
i
shrank
from
a
public
confession
of
my
shameful
past
life
a
woman
would
have
remembered
what
reasons
i
had
for
pitying
the
man
who
loved
me
and
for
accepting
any
responsibility
rather
than
associate
his
memory
before
the
world
with
an
unworthy
passion
for
a
degraded
creature
ending
in
an
act
of
suicide
even
if
i
had
made
that
cruel
sacrifice
would
public
opinion
have
believed
such
a
person
as
i
am
against
the
evidence
of
a
medical
man
and
the
verdict
of
a
jury
no
morris
i
said
nothing
and
i
was
resolved
to
say
nothing
so
long
as
the
choice
of
alternatives
was
left
to
me
on
the
day
when
mirabel
implored
me
to
save
him
that
choice
was
no
longer
mine
and
you
know
what
i
did
and
now
again
when
suspicion
after
all
the
long
interval
that
had
passed
has
followed
and
found
that
innocent
man
you
know
what
i
have
done
what
more
do
you
ask
of
me
your
pardon
i
said
for
not
having
understood
you
and
a
last
favor
may
i
repeat
what
i
have
heard
to
the
one
person
of
all
others
who
ought
to
know
and
who
must
know
what
you
have
told
me
it
was
needless
to
hint
more
plainly
that
i
was
speaking
of
emily
miss
jethro
granted
my
request
it
shall
be
as
you
please
she
answered
say
for
me
to
daughter
that
the
grateful
remembrance
of
her
is
my
one
refuge
from
the
thoughts
that
tortured
me
when
we
spoke
together
on
her
last
night
at
school
she
has
made
this
dead
heart
of
mine
feel
a
reviving
breath
of
life
when
i
think
of
her
never
in
our
earthly
pilgrimage
shall
we
meet
again
i
implore
her
to
pity
and
forget
me
farewell
morris
farewell
i
confess
that
the
tears
came
into
my
eyes
when
i
could
see
clearly
again
i
was
alone
in
the
chapter
lxvii
the
true
consolation
emily
closed
the
pages
which
told
her
that
her
father
had
died
by
his
own
hand
cecilia
still
held
her
tenderly
embraced
by
slow
degrees
her
head
dropped
until
it
rested
on
her
friend
s
bosom
silently
she
suffered
silently
cecilia
bent
forward
and
kissed
her
forehead
the
sounds
that
penetrated
to
the
room
were
not
out
of
harmony
with
the
time
from
a
distant
house
the
voices
of
children
were
just
audible
singing
the
plaintive
melody
of
a
hymn
and
now
and
then
the
breeze
blew
the
first
faded
leaves
of
autumn
against
the
window
neither
of
the
girls
knew
how
long
the
minutes
followed
each
other
uneventfully
before
there
was
a
change
emily
raised
her
head
and
looked
at
cecilia
i
have
one
friend
left
she
said
not
only
me
love
oh
i
hope
not
only
me
yes
only
i
want
to
say
something
emily
but
i
am
afraid
of
hurting
my
dear
do
you
remember
what
we
once
read
in
a
book
of
history
at
school
it
told
of
the
death
of
a
tortured
man
in
the
old
time
who
was
broken
on
the
wheel
he
lived
through
it
long
enough
to
say
that
the
agony
after
the
first
stroke
of
the
club
dulled
his
capacity
for
feeling
pain
when
the
next
blows
fell
i
fancy
pain
of
the
mind
must
follow
the
same
rule
nothing
you
can
say
will
hurt
me
i
only
wanted
to
ask
emily
if
you
were
engaged
at
one
time
to
marry
mirabel
is
it
true
false
he
pressed
me
to
consent
to
an
engagement
and
i
said
he
must
not
hurry
what
made
you
say
that
i
thought
of
alban
vainly
cecilia
tried
to
restrain
herself
a
cry
of
joy
escaped
her
are
you
glad
emily
asked
why
cecilia
made
no
direct
reply
may
i
tell
you
what
you
wanted
to
know
a
little
while
since
she
said
you
asked
why
morris
left
it
all
to
me
instead
of
speaking
to
you
himself
when
i
put
the
same
question
to
him
he
told
me
to
read
what
he
had
written
not
a
shadow
of
suspicion
rests
on
mirabel
he
said
emily
is
free
to
marry
him
and
free
through
me
can
tell
her
that
for
her
sake
and
for
mine
it
must
not
be
all
that
i
can
do
is
to
leave
old
remembrances
to
plead
for
me
if
they
fail
i
shall
know
that
she
will
be
happier
with
mirabel
than
with
and
you
will
submit
i
asked
because
i
love
her
he
answered
i
must
oh
how
pale
you
are
have
i
distressed
you
you
have
done
me
will
you
see
him
emily
pointed
to
the
manuscript
at
such
a
time
as
this
she
said
cecilia
still
held
to
her
resolution
such
a
time
as
this
is
the
right
time
she
answered
it
is
now
when
you
most
want
to
be
comforted
that
you
ought
to
see
him
who
can
quiet
your
poor
aching
heart
as
can
quiet
it
she
impulsively
snatched
at
the
manuscript
and
threw
it
out
of
sight
i
can
t
bear
to
look
at
it
she
said
emily
if
i
have
done
wrong
will
you
forgive
me
i
saw
him
this
morning
before
i
came
here
i
was
afraid
of
what
might
happen
i
refused
to
break
the
dreadful
news
to
you
unless
he
was
somewhere
near
us
your
good
old
servant
knows
where
to
go
let
me
send
her
ellmother
herself
opened
the
door
and
stood
doubtful
on
the
threshold
hysterically
sobbing
and
laughing
at
the
same
time
i
m
everything
that
s
bad
the
good
old
creature
burst
out
i
ve
been
listening
i
ve
been
lying
i
said
you
wanted
him
turn
me
out
of
my
situation
if
you
like
i
ve
got
him
here
he
is
in
another
moment
emily
was
in
his
arms
and
they
were
alone
on
his
faithful
breast
the
blessed
relief
of
tears
came
to
her
at
last
she
burst
out
crying
oh
alban
can
you
forgive
me
he
gently
raised
her
head
so
that
he
could
see
her
face
my
love
let
me
look
at
you
he
said
i
want
to
think
again
of
the
day
when
we
parted
in
the
garden
at
school
do
you
remember
the
one
conviction
that
sustained
me
i
told
you
emily
there
was
a
time
of
fulfillment
to
come
in
our
two
lives
and
i
have
never
wholly
lost
the
dear
belief
my
own
darling
the
time
has
come
postscript
gossip
in
the
studio
the
winter
time
had
arrived
alban
was
clearing
his
palette
after
a
hard
day
s
work
at
the
cottage
the
servant
announced
that
tea
was
ready
and
that
miss
ladd
was
waiting
to
see
him
in
the
next
room
alban
ran
in
and
received
the
visitor
cordially
with
both
hands
welcome
back
to
england
i
needn
t
ask
if
the
has
done
you
good
you
are
looking
ten
years
younger
than
when
you
went
miss
ladd
smiled
i
shall
soon
be
ten
years
older
again
if
i
go
back
to
netherwoods
she
replied
i
didn
t
believe
it
at
the
time
but
i
know
better
now
our
friend
doctor
allday
was
right
when
he
said
that
my
working
days
were
over
i
must
give
up
the
school
to
a
younger
and
stronger
successor
and
make
the
best
i
can
in
retirement
of
what
is
left
of
my
life
you
and
emily
may
expect
to
have
me
as
a
near
neighbor
where
is
emily
far
away
in
the
in
the
north
you
don
t
mean
that
she
has
gone
back
to
delvin
she
has
gone
back
with
ellmother
to
take
care
of
her
at
my
express
request
you
know
what
emily
is
when
there
is
an
act
of
mercy
to
be
done
that
unhappy
man
has
been
sinking
with
intervals
of
partial
recovery
for
months
past
delvin
sent
word
to
us
that
the
end
was
near
and
that
the
one
last
wish
her
brother
was
able
to
express
was
the
wish
to
see
emily
he
had
been
for
some
hours
unable
to
speak
when
my
wife
arrived
but
he
knew
her
and
smiled
faintly
he
was
just
able
to
lift
his
hand
she
took
it
and
waited
by
him
and
spoke
words
of
consolation
and
kindness
from
time
to
time
as
the
night
advanced
he
sank
into
sleep
still
holding
her
hand
they
only
knew
that
he
had
passed
from
sleep
to
death
passed
without
a
movement
or
a
sigh
when
his
hand
turned
cold
emily
remained
for
a
day
at
the
tower
to
comfort
poor
delvin
and
she
comes
home
thank
god
this
evening
i
needn
t
ask
if
you
are
happy

ladd

have
my
bath
in
the
morning
if
that
isn

age

the
place

fascinated
mayor
and
corporation
to
confide
the
work
to
my

no
hope
yet
of
that
sweet
girl
being
married
miss
ladd
asked
we
old
maids

in
marriage
morris
though
some
of
us
don
t
own
there
seems
to
be
a
chance
alban
answered
a
young
lord
has
turned
up
at
monksmoor
a
handsome
pleasant
fellow
and
a
rising
man
in
politics
he
happened
to
be
in
the
house
a
few
days
before
cecilia
s
birthday
and
he
asked
my
advice
about
the
right
present
to
give
her
i
said
try
something
new
in
when
he
found
i
was
in
earnest
what
do
you
think
he
did
sent
his
steam
yacht
to
rouen
for
some
of
the
famous
pastry
you
should
have
seen
cecilia
when
the
young
lord
offered
his
delicious
gift
if
i
could
paint
that
smile
and
those
eyes
i
should
be
the
greatest
artist
living
i
believe
she
will
marry
him
need
i
say
how
rich
they
will
be
we
shall
not
envy
them
we
are
rich
too
everything
is
comparative
the
portrait
of
wyvil
will
put
three
hundred
pounds
in
my
pocket
i
have
earned
a
hundred
and
twenty
more
by
illustrations
since
we
have
been
married
and
my
wife
s
income
i
like
to
be
particular
is
only
five
shillings
and
tenpence
short
of
two
hundred
a
year
moral
we
are
rich
as
well
as
without
a
thought
of
the
future
miss
ladd
asked
slyly
oh
doctor
allday
has
taken
the
future
in
hand
he
revels
in
the
jokes
which
used
to
be
addressed
to
people
in
his
time
my
dear
fellow
he
said
the
other
day
you
may
possibly
be
under
a
joyful
necessity
of
sending
for
the
doctor
before
we
are
all
a
year
older
in
that
case
let
it
be
understood
that
i
am
honorary
physician
to
the
the
old
man
talks
of
getting
me
another
portrait
to
do
the
greatest
ass
in
the
medical
profession
he
informed
me
has
just
been
made
a
baronet
and
his
admiring
friends
have
decided
that
he
is
to
be
painted
at
full
length
with
his
bandy
legs
hidden
under
a
gown
and
his
great
globular
eyes
staring
at
the
spectator
i
ll
get
you
the
shall
i
tell
you
what
he
says
of
rook
s
recovery
miss
ladd
held
up
her
hands
in
amazement
recovery
she
exclaimed
and
a
most
remarkable
recovery
too
alban
informed
her
it
is
the
first
case
on
record
of
any
person
getting
over
such
an
injury
as
she
has
received
doctor
allday
looked
grave
when
he
heard
of
it
i
begin
to
believe
in
the
devil
he
said
nobody
else
could
have
saved
other
people
don
t
take
that
view
she
has
been
celebrated
in
all
the
medical
newspapers
and
she
has
been
admitted
to
come
excellent
almshouse
to
live
in
comfortable
idleness
to
a
green
old
age
the
best
of
it
is
that
she
shakes
her
head
when
her
wonderful
recovery
is
mentioned
it
seems
such
a
pity
she
says
i
was
so
fit
for
rook
having
got
rid
of
his
wife
is
in
excellent
spirits
he
is
occupied
in
looking
after
an
imbecile
old
gentleman
and
when
he
is
asked
if
he
likes
the
employment
he
winks
mysteriously
and
slaps
his
pocket
now
miss
ladd
i
think
it
s
my
turn
to
hear
some
news
what
have
you
got
to
tell
me
i
believe
i
can
match
your
account
of
rook
miss
ladd
said
do
you
care
to
hear
what
has
become
of
francine
alban
rattling
on
hitherto
in
boyish
high
spirits
suddenly
became
serious
i
have
no
doubt
miss
de
sor
is
doing
well
he
said
sternly
she
is
too
heartless
and
wicked
not
to
you
are
getting
like
your
old
cynical
self
again
morris
and
you
are
wrong
i
called
this
morning
on
the
agent
who
had
the
care
of
francine
when
i
left
england
when
i
mentioned
her
name
he
showed
me
a
telegram
sent
to
him
by
her
father
there
s
my
authority
he
said
for
letting
her
leave
my
the
message
was
short
enough
to
be
easily
remembered
anything
my
daughter
likes
as
long
as
she
doesn
t
come
back
to
in
those
cruel
terms
de
sor
wrote
of
his
own
child
the
agent
was
just
as
unfeeling
in
his
way
he
called
her
the
victim
of
slighted
love
and
clever
proselytizing
in
plain
words
he
said
the
priest
of
the
catholic
chapel
close
by
has
converted
her
and
she
is
now
a
novice
in
a
convent
of
carmelite
nuns
in
the
west
of
england
who
could
have
expected
it
who
knows
how
it
may
end
as
miss
ladd
spoke
the
bell
rang
at
the
cottage
gate
here
she
is
alban
cried
leading
the
way
into
the
hall
emily
has
come
home
