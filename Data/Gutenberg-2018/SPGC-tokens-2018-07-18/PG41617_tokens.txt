introduction
too
frequently
it
is
the
custom
to
regard
the
study
of
the
science
of
armory
as
that
of
a
subject
which
has
passed
beyond
the
limits
of
practical
politics
heraldry
has
been
termed
the
shorthand
of
history
but
nevertheless
the
study
of
that
shorthand
has
been
approached
too
often
as
if
it
were
but
the
study
of
a
dead
language
the
result
has
been
that
too
much
faith
has
been
placed
in
the
works
of
older
writers
whose
dicta
have
been
accepted
as
both
unquestionably
correct
at
the
date
they
wrote
and
as
a
consequence
equally
binding
at
the
present
day
since
the
boke
of
albans
was
written
into
the
heraldic
portion
of
which
the
author
managed
to
compress
an
unconscionable
amount
of
rubbish
books
and
treatises
on
the
subject
of
armory
have
issued
from
the
press
in
a
constant
succession
a
few
of
them
stand
a
head
and
shoulders
above
the
remainder
the
said
remainder
have
already
sunk
into
oblivion
such
a
book
as
guillim
must
of
necessity
rank
in
the
forefront
of
any
armorial
bibliography
but
any
one
seeking
to
judge
the
armory
of
the
present
day
by
the
standards
and
ethics
adopted
by
that
writer
would
find
himself
making
mistake
after
mistake
and
led
hopelessly
astray
there
can
be
very
little
doubt
that
the
display
of
heraldry
is
an
accurate
representation
of
the
laws
of
armory
which
governed
the
use
of
arms
at
the
date
the
book
was
written
and
it
correctly
puts
forward
the
opinions
which
were
then
accepted
concerning
the
past
history
of
the
science
there
are
two
points
however
which
must
be
borne
in
mind
the
first
is
that
the
critical
desire
for
accuracy
which
fortunately
seems
to
have
been
the
keynote
of
research
during
the
nineteenth
century
has
produced
students
of
armory
whose
investigations
into
facts
have
swept
away
the
fables
the
myths
and
the
falsehood
which
had
collected
around
the
ancient
science
and
which
in
their
preposterous
assertions
had
earned
for
armory
a
ridicule
a
contempt
and
a
disbelief
which
the
science
itself
and
moreover
the
active
practice
of
the
science
had
never
at
any
time
warranted
or
deserved
the
desire
to
gratify
the
vanity
of
illustrious
patrons
rendered
the
mythical
traditions
attached
to
armory
more
difficult
to
explode
than
in
the
cases
of
those
other
sciences
in
which
no
one
has
a
personal
interest
in
x
upholding
the
wrong
but
a
study
of
the
scientific
works
of
bygone
days
and
the
comparison
for
example
of
a
sixteenth
or
seventeenth
century
medical
book
with
a
similar
work
of
the
present
day
will
show
that
all
scientific
knowledge
during
past
centuries
was
a
curious
conglomeration
of
unquestionable
fact
interwoven
with
and
partly
obscured
by
a
vast
amount
of
false
information
which
now
can
either
be
dismissed
as
utter
rubbish
or
controverted
and
disproved
on
the
score
of
being
plausible
untruth
consequently
armory
no
less
than
medicine
theology
or
jurisprudence
should
not
be
lightly
esteemed
because
our
predecessors
knew
less
about
the
subject
than
is
known
at
the
present
day
or
because
they
believed
implicitly
dogma
and
tradition
which
we
ourselves
know
to
be
and
accept
as
exploded
research
and
investigation
constantly
goes
on
and
every
day
adds
to
our
knowledge
the
second
point
which
perhaps
is
the
most
important
is
the
patent
fact
that
heraldry
and
armory
are
not
a
dead
science
but
are
an
actual
living
reality
armory
may
be
a
quaint
survival
of
a
time
with
different
manners
and
customs
and
different
ideas
from
our
own
but
the
word
finis
has
not
yet
been
written
to
the
science
which
is
still
slowly
developing
and
altering
and
changing
as
it
is
suited
to
the
altered
manners
and
customs
of
the
present
day
i
doubt
not
that
this
view
will
be
a
startling
one
to
many
who
look
upon
armory
as
indissolubly
associated
with
parchments
and
writings
already
musty
with
age
but
so
long
as
the
sovereign
has
the
power
to
create
a
new
order
of
knighthood
and
attach
thereto
heraldic
insignia
so
long
as
the
crown
has
the
power
to
create
a
new
coronet
or
to
order
a
new
ceremonial
so
long
as
new
coats
of
arms
are
being
called
into
being
for
so
long
is
it
idle
to
treat
armory
and
heraldry
as
a
science
incapable
of
further
development
or
as
a
science
which
in
recent
periods
has
not
altered
in
its
laws
the
many
mistaken
ideas
upon
armory
however
are
not
all
due
to
the
two
considerations
which
have
been
put
forward
many
are
due
to
the
fact
that
the
of
armory
professing
to
detail
the
laws
of
the
science
have
not
always
been
written
by
those
having
complete
knowledge
of
their
subject
some
statement
appears
in
a
textbook
of
armory
it
is
copied
into
book
after
book
and
accepted
by
those
who
study
armory
as
being
correct
whilst
all
the
time
it
is
absolutely
wrong
and
has
never
been
accepted
or
acted
upon
by
the
officers
of
arms
one
instance
will
illustrate
my
meaning
there
is
scarcely
a
of
armory
which
does
not
lay
down
the
rule
that
when
a
crest
issues
from
a
coronet
it
must
not
be
placed
upon
a
wreath
now
there
is
no
rule
whatever
upon
the
subject
and
instances
are
frequent
both
in
ancient
and
in
modern
grants
in
which
coronets
have
been
granted
to
be
borne
upon
wreaths
and
the
wreath
should
xi
be
inserted
or
omitted
to
the
original
grant
of
the
consequently
the
rule
must
be
expunged
another
fruitful
source
of
error
is
the
effort
which
has
frequently
been
made
to
assimilate
the
laws
of
armory
prevailing
in
the
three
different
kingdoms
into
one
single
series
of
rules
and
regulations
some
writers
have
even
gone
so
far
as
to
attempt
to
assimilate
with
our
own
the
rules
and
regulations
which
hold
upon
the
continent
as
a
matter
of
fact
many
of
the
laws
of
arms
in
england
and
scotland
are
radically
different
and
care
needs
to
be
taken
to
point
out
these
differences
the
truest
way
to
ascertain
the
laws
of
armory
is
by
deduction
from
known
facts
nevertheless
such
a
practice
may
lead
one
astray
for
the
number
of
exceptions
to
any
given
rule
in
armory
is
always
great
and
it
is
sometimes
difficult
to
tell
what
is
the
rule
and
which
are
the
exceptions
moreover
the
sovereign
as
the
fountain
of
honour
can
any
rule
or
law
of
arms
and
many
exceptional
cases
which
have
been
governed
by
specific
grants
have
been
accepted
in
times
past
as
demonstrating
the
laws
of
armory
when
they
have
been
no
more
than
instances
of
exceptional
favour
on
the
part
of
the
crown
in
england
no
one
is
compelled
to
bear
arms
unless
he
wishes
but
should
he
desire
to
do
so
the
inland
revenue
requires
a
payment
of
one
or
two
guineas
according
to
the
method
of
use
from
this
voluntary
taxation
the
yearly
revenue
exceeds
this
affords
pretty
clear
evidence
that
armory
is
still
decidedly
popular
and
that
its
use
and
display
are
extensive
but
at
the
same
time
it
would
be
foolish
to
suppose
that
the
estimation
in
which
armory
is
held
is
equal
to
or
approaches
the
romantic
value
which
in
former
days
was
attached
to
the
inheritance
of
arms
the
result
of
this
has
been
and
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
ancient
examples
are
accepted
and
extolled
beyond
what
should
be
the
case
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
very
ancient
examples
of
armory
which
have
come
down
to
us
may
be
examples
of
the
handicraft
of
ignorant
individuals
and
it
is
not
safe
to
accept
unquestioningly
laws
of
arms
which
are
deduced
from
heraldic
of
other
days
most
of
them
are
correct
because
as
a
rule
such
handicraft
was
done
under
supervision
but
there
is
always
the
risk
that
it
has
not
been
and
risk
should
be
borne
in
when
estimating
the
value
of
any
particular
example
of
armory
as
proof
or
contradiction
of
any
particular
armorial
law
there
were
heraldic
stationers
before
the
present
day
a
somewhat
similar
consideration
must
govern
the
estimate
of
the
heraldic
art
of
a
former
day
to
every
action
we
are
told
there
is
a
reaction
and
the
reaction
of
the
present
day
admirable
and
commendable
as
it
undoubtedly
is
which
has
taken
the
art
of
armory
back
to
the
style
in
vogue
in
past
centuries
needs
to
be
kept
within
intelligent
xii
bounds
that
the
freedom
of
design
and
draughtsmanship
of
the
old
artists
should
be
copied
is
desirable
but
at
the
same
time
there
is
not
the
slightest
necessity
to
copy
and
to
deliberately
copy
the
crudeness
of
execution
which
undoubtedly
exists
in
much
of
the
older
work
the
revulsion
from
what
has
been
aptly
styled
the
school
of
heraldry
has
caused
some
artists
to
produce
heraldic
drawings
which
though
doubtless
modelled
upon
ancient
examples
are
grotesque
to
the
last
degree
and
can
be
described
in
no
other
way
in
conclusion
i
have
to
repeat
my
grateful
acknowledgments
to
the
many
individuals
who
assisted
me
in
the
preparation
of
my
art
of
heraldry
upon
which
this
present
volume
is
founded
and
whose

i
have
again
made
use
of
the
very
copious
index
herein
is
entirely
the
work
of
my
professional
clerk
kenward
for
which
i
offer
him
my
thanks
only
those
who
have
had

the
origin
of
armory
armory
is
that
science
of
which
the
rules
and
the
laws
govern
the
use
display
meaning
and
knowledge
of
the
pictured
signs
and
emblems
appertaining
to
shield
helmet
or
banner
heraldry
has
a
wider
meaning
for
it
comprises
everything
within
the
duties
of
a
herald
and
whilst
armory
undoubtedly
is
heraldry
the
regulation
of
ceremonials
and
matters
of
pedigree
which
are
really
also
within
the
scope
of
heraldry
most
decidedly
are
not
armory
armory
relates
only
to
the
emblems
and
devices
armoury
relates
to
the
weapons
themselves
as
weapons
of
warfare
or
to
the
place
used
for
the
storing
of
the
weapons
but
these
distinctions
of
spelling
are
modern
the
word
arms
like
many
other
words
in
the
english
language
has
several
meanings
and
at
the
present
day
is
used
in
several
senses
it
may
mean
the
weapons
themselves
it
may
mean
the
limbs
upon
the
human
body
even
from
the
heraldic
point
of
view
it
may
mean
the
entire
achievement
but
usually
it
is
employed
in
reference
to
the
device
upon
the
shield
only
of
the
exact
origin
of
arms
and
armory
nothing
whatever
is
definitely
known
and
it
becomes
difficult
to
point
to
any
particular
period
as
the
period
covering
the
origin
of
armory
for
the
very
simple
reason
that
it
is
much
more
difficult
to
decide
what
is
or
is
not
to
be
admitted
as
armorial
until
comparatively
recently
heraldic
books
referred
armory
indifferently
to
the
tribes
of
israel
to
the
greeks
to
the
romans
to
the
assyrians
and
the
saxons
and
we
are
equally
familiar
with
the
lion
of
judah
and
the
eagle
of
the
cæsars
in
other
directions
we
find
the
same
sort
of
thing
for
it
has
ever
been
the
practice
of
nations
to
bestow
or
to
assume
the
virtues
and
the
names
of
animals
and
of
deities
as
symbols
of
honour
we
scarcely
need
refer
to
the
totems
of
the
north
american
indians
for
proof
of
such
a
practice
they
have
reduced
the
subject
almost
to
an
exact
science
and
there
can
not
be
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
it
is
to
this
practice
that
armory
is
to
be
traced
if
its
origin
is
to
be
followed
out
to
its
logical
and
most
remote
beginning
equally
is
it
certain
that
many
recognised
heraldic
figures
and
more
particularly
those
mythical
creatures
of
which
the
armorial
menagerie
alone
has
now
cognisance
are
due
to
the
art
of
civilisations
older
than
our
own
and
the
legends
of
those
civilisations
which
have
called
these
mythical
creatures
into
being
the
widest
definition
of
armory
would
have
it
that
any
pictorial
badge
which
is
used
by
an
individual
or
a
family
with
the
meaning
that
it
is
a
badge
indicative
of
that
person
or
family
and
adopted
and
repeatedly
used
in
that
sense
is
heraldic
if
such
be
your
definition
you
may
ransack
the
scriptures
for
the
arms
of
the
tribes
of
israel
the
writings
of
the
greek
and
roman
poets
for
the
decorations
of
the
armour
and
the
persons
of
their
heroes
mythical
and
actual
and
you
may
annex
numberless
heraldic
instances
from
the
art
of
nineveh
of
babylon
and
of
egypt
your
heraldry
is
of
the
beginning
and
from
the
beginning
it
fact
but
is
it
heraldry
the
statement
in
the
boke
of
albans
that
christ
was
a
gentleman
of
coat
armour
is
a
fable
and
due
distinction
must
be
had
between
the
fact
and
the
fiction
in
this
as
in
all
other
similar
cases
eve
in
his
decorative
heraldry
alludes
to
and
illustrates
many
striking
examples
of
figures
of
an
embryonic
type
of
heraldry
of
which
the
best
are
one
from
a
chaldean
the
earliest
known
device
that
can
in
any
way
be
called
heraldic
and
another
a
device
from
a
byzantine
silk
of
the
tenth
century
eve
certainly
seems
inclined
to
follow
the
older
heraldic
writers
in
giving
as
wide
an
interpretation
as
possible
to
the
word
heraldic
but
it
is
significant
that
none
of
these
early
instances
which
he
gives
appear
to
have
any
relation
to
a
shield
so
that
even
if
it
be
conceded
that
the
figures
are
heraldic
they
certainly
can
not
be
said
to
be
armorial
but
doubtless
the
inclusion
of
such
instances
is
due
to
an
attempt
conscious
or
unconscious
on
the
part
of
the
writers
who
have
taken
their
stand
on
the
side
of
great
antiquity
to
so
frame
the
definition
of
armory
that
it
shall
include
everything
heraldic
and
due
perhaps
somewhat
to
the
half
unconscious
reasoning
that
these
mythical
animals
and
more
especially
the
peculiarly
heraldic
positions
they
are
depicted
in
which
nowadays
we
only
know
as
part
of
armory
and
which
exist
nowhere
else
within
our
knowledge
save
within
the
charmed
circle
of
heraldry
must
be
evidence
of
the
great
antiquity
of
that
science
or
art
call
it
which
you
will
but
it
is
a
false
deduction
due
to
a
confusion
of
premise
and
conclusion
we
find
certain
figures
at
the
present
day
purely
heraldic
we
find
those
figures
fifty
centuries
ago
it
certainly
seems
a
correct
conclusion
that
therefore
heraldry
must
be
of
that
age
but
is
not
the
real
conclusion
that
our
heraldic
figures
being
so
old
it
is
evident
that
the
figures
originated
long
before
heraldry
was
ever
thought
of
and
that
instead
of
these
mythical
figures
having
been
originated
by
the
necessities
of
heraldry
and
being
part
or
even
the
rudimentary
origin
of
heraldry
they
had
existed
other
reasons
and
and
that
when
the
science
of
heraldry
sprang
into
being
it
found
the
of
its
forms
and
charges
already
existing
and
that
of
these
figures
owe
their
being
to
heraldry
the
gryphon
is
supposed
to
have
as
is
the
eagle
from
the
dimidiation
of
two
coats
of
arms
resulting
from
impalement
by
reason
of
marriage
both
these
figures
were
known
ages
earlier
thus
departs
yet
another
of
the
little
fictions
which
past
writers
on
armory
have
fostered
and
perpetuated
whether
the
ancient
egyptians
and
assyrians
knew
they
were
depicting
mythical
animals
and
did
it
intending
them
to
be
symbolical
of
attributes
of
their
deities
something
beyond
what
they
were
familiar
with
in
their
ordinary
life
we
do
not
know
nor
indeed
have
we
any
certain
knowledge
that
there
have
never
been
animals
of
which
their
figures
are
but
imperfect
and
crude
representations
but
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
because
an
egyptian
artist
drew
a
certain
figure
which
figure
is
now
appropriated
to
the
peculiar
use
of
armory
that
he
knew
anything
whatever
of
the
laws
of
armory
further
where
is
this
argument
to
end
there
is
nothing
peculiarly
heraldic
about
the
lion
passant
statant
dormant
couchant
or
salient
and
though
heraldic
artists
may
for
the
sake
of
artistic
appearance
distort
the
brute
away
from
his
natural
figure
the
rampant
is
alone
the
position
which
exists
not
in
nature
and
if
the
argument
is
to
be
applied
to
the
bitter
end
heraldry
must
be
taken
back
to
the
very
earliest
instance
which
exists
of
any
representation
of
a
lion
the
proposition
is
absurd
the
ancient
artists
drew
their
lions
how
they
liked
regardless
of
armory
and
its
laws
which
did
not
then
exist
and
from
decorative
reasons
they
evolved
a
certain
number
of
methods
of
depicting
the
positions
of
the
lion
and
the
eagle
to
suit
their
decorative
purposes
when
heraldry
came
into
existence
it
came
in
as
an
adjunct
of
decoration
and
it
necessarily
followed
that
the
whole
of
the
positions
in
which
the
craftsmen
found
the
eagle
or
the
lion
depicted
were
appropriated
with
the
animals
for
heraldry
that
this
appropriation
for
the
exclusive
purposes
of
armory
has
been
silently
acquiesced
in
by
the
decorative
artists
of
later
days
is
simply
proof
of
the
intense
power
and
authority
which
accrued
later
to
armory
and
which
was
in
fact
attached
to
anything
relating
to
privilege
and
prerogative
to
put
it
baldly
the
dominating
authority
of
heraldry
and
its
dogmatic
protection
by
the
powers
that
were
appropriated
certain
figures
to
its
use
and
then
defied
any
one
to
use
them
for
more
humble
decorative
purposes
not
allied
with
armory
and
it
is
the
trail
of
this
autocratic
appropriation
and
from
the
decorative
point
of
view
this
arrogant
appropriation
which
can
be
traced
in
the
present
idea
that
a
griffin
or
a
spread
eagle
for
example
must
be
heraldic
consequently
the
argument
as
to
the
antiquity
of
heraldry
which
is
founded
upon
the
discovery
of
the
heraldic
creature
in
the
remote
ages
goes
by
the
board
one
practical
instance
may
perhaps
more
fully
demonstrate
my
meaning
there
is
one
figure
probably
the
most
beautiful
of
all
of
those
which
we
owe
to
egypt
which
is
now
rapidly
being
absorbed
into
heraldry
i
refer
to
the
sphinx
this
whilst
strangely
in
keeping
with
the
remaining
mythical
heraldic
figures
for
some
reason
or
other
escaped
the
exclusive
appropriation
of
armorial
use
until
within
modern
times
one
of
the
earliest
instances
of
its
use
in
recognised
armory
occurs
in
the
grant
to
sir
john
moore
the
hero
of
corunna
and
another
will
be
found
in
the
augmentation
granted
to
admiral
sir
alexander
cochrane
since
then
it
has
been
used
on
some
number
of
occasions
it
certainly
remained
however
for
the
late
garter
king
of
arms
to
evolve
from
the
depths
of
his
imagination
a
position
which
no
egyptian
sphinx
ever
occupied
when
he
granted
two
of
them
as
supporters
to
the
late
sir
edward
malet
the
sphinx
has
also
been
adopted
as
the
badge
of
one
of
his
regiments
and
i
have
very
little
doubt
that
now
egypt
has
come
under
our
control
the
sphinx
will
figure
in
some
number
of
the
grants
of
the
future
to
commemorate
fortunes
made
in
that
country
or
lifetimes
spent
in
the
egyptian
services
if
this
be
so
the
dominating
influence
of
armory
will
doubtless
in
the
course
of
another
century
have
given
to
the
sphinx
as
it
has
to
many
other
objects
a
distinctly
heraldic
nature
and
character
in
the
mind
of
the
man
in
the
street
to
which
we
nowadays
so
often
refer
the
arbitrament
between
conflicting
opinions
perhaps
in
the
even
yet
more
remote
future
when
the
world
in
general
accepts
as
a
fact
that
armory
did
not
exist
at
the
time
of
the
norman
conquest
we
shall
have
some
interesting
and
enterprising
individual
writing
a
book
to
demonstrate
that
because
the
sphinx
existed
in
egypt
long
before
the
days
of
cleopatra
heraldry
must
of
necessity
be
equally
antique
i
have
no
wish
however
to
dismiss
thus
lightly
the
subject
of
the
antiquity
of
heraldry
because
there
is
one
side
of
the
question
which
i
have
not
yet
touched
upon
and
that
is
the
symbolism
of
these
ancient
and
heraldic
examples
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
symbolism
forms
an
integral
part
of
armory
in
fact
there
is
no
doubt
that
armory
as
a
whole
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
kind
of
symbolism
i
have
no
sympathy
whatever
with
many
of
the
ideas
concerning
this
symbolism
which
will
be
found
in
nearly
all
heraldic
books
before
the
day
of
the
late
planché
somerset
herald
who
fired
the
train
which
exploded
then
and
for
ever
the
absurd
ideas
of
former
writers
that
an
argent
field
meant
purity
that
a
field
of
gules
meant
royal
or
even
martial
ancestors
that
a
saltire
meant
the
capture
of
a
city
or
a
lion
rampant
noble
and
enviable
qualities
i
utterly
deny
but
that
nearly
every
coat
of
arms
for
any
one
of
the
name
of
fletcher
bears
upon
it
in
some
form
or
another
an
arrow
or
an
because
the
origin
of
the
name
comes
from
the
occupation
of
the
fletcher
who
was
an
is
true
enough
symbolism
of
that
kind
will
be
found
constantly
in
armory
as
in
the
case
of
the
foxes
and
foxes
heads
in
the
various
coats
of
fox
the
lions
in
the
coats
of
arms
of
lyons
the
horse
in
the
arms
of
trotter
and
the
acorns
in
the
arms
of
oakes
in
fact
by
far
the
larger
proportion
of
the
older
coats
of
arms
where
they
can
be
traced
to
their
real
origin
exhibit
some
such
derivation
there
is
another
kind
of
symbolism
which
formerly
and
still
favours
the
introduction
of
swords
and
spears
and
bombshells
into
grants
of
arms
to
military
men
that
gives
bezants
to
bankers
and
those
connected
with
money
and
that
assigns
woolpacks
and
to
the
shields
of
textile
merchants
but
that
is
a
sane
and
reasonable
symbolism
which
the
reputed
symbolism
of
the
earlier
heraldry
books
was
not
it
has
yet
to
be
demonstrated
however
though
the
belief
is
very
generally
credited
that
all
these
very
ancient
egyptian
and
assyrian
figures
of
a
heraldic
character
had
anything
of
symbolism
about
them
but
even
granting
the
whole
symbolism
which
is
claimed
for
them
we
get
but
little
further
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
eagle
from
untold
ages
has
had
an
imperial
symbolism
which
it
still
possesses
but
that
symbolism
is
not
necessarily
heraldic
and
it
is
much
more
probable
that
heraldry
appropriated
both
the
eagle
and
its
symbolism
ready
made
and
together
consequently
if
as
we
have
shown
the
of
the
eagle
is
not
proof
of
the
coeval
existence
of
heraldry
no
more
is
the
existence
of
the
imperial
eagle
for
if
we
are
to
regard
all
symbolism
as
heraldic
where
are
we
either
to
begin
or
to
end
church
vestments
and
ecclesiastical
emblems
are
symbolism
run
riot
in
fact
they
are
little
else
but
by
no
stretch
of
imagination
can
these
be
considered
heraldic
with
the
exception
of
the
few
for
example
the
crosier
the
mitre
and
the
pallium
which
heraldry
has
appropriated
ready
made
therefore
though
heraldry
appropriated
ready
made
from
other
decorative
art
and
from
nature
and
handicraft
the
whole
of
its
charges
and
though
it
is
evident
heraldry
also
appropriated
ready
made
a
great
deal
of
its
symbolism
neither
the
earlier
existence
of
the
forms
which
it
appropriated
nor
the
earlier
existence
of
their
symbolism
can
be
said
to
weigh
at
all
as
determining
factors
in
the
consideration
of
the
age
of
heraldry
sloane
evans
in
his
grammar
of
heraldry
p
ix
gives
the
following
instances
as
evidence
of
the
greater
antiquity
and
they
are
worthy
at
any
rate
of
attention
if
the
matter
is
to
be
impartially
considered
the
antiquity
of
ensigns
and
symbols
may
be
proved
by
reference
to
holy
writ

speaking
of
the
ornaments
and
devices
on
their
ships
he
says
some
other
things
there
are
in
the
prow
and
stern
that
deserve
our
notice
as
those
ornaments
wherewith
the
extremities
of
the
ship
were
beautified
commonly
called
greek
akronea
or
greek
neôn
korônides
in
latin
the
form
of
them
sometimes
represented
helmets
sometimes
living
creatures
but
most
frequently
was
winded
into
a
round
compass
whence
they
are
so
commonly
named
and
to
the
greek
akrostolia
in
the
prow
answered
the
greek
aphgasta
in
the
stern
which
were
often
of
an
orbicular
figure
or
fashioned
like
wings
to
which
a
little
shield
called
greek
aspideion
or
greek
aspidiskê
was
frequently
affixed
sometimes
a
piece
of
wood
was
erected
whereon
ribbons
of
divers
colours
were
hung
and
served
instead
of
a
flag
to
distinguish
the
ship
greek
chêniskos
was
so
called
from
greek
chên
whose
figure
it
resembled
because
geese
were
looked
on
as
fortunate
omens
to
mariners
for
that
they
swim
on
the
top
of
the
waters
and
sink
not
greek
parasêmon
was
the
flag
whereby
ships
were
distinguished
from
one
another
it
was
placed
in
the
prow
just
below
the
greek
stolos
being
sometimes
carved
and
frequently
painted
whence
it
is
in
latin
termed
representing
the
form
of
a
a
a
or
any
other
thing
wherein
it
was
distinguished
from
what
was
called
or
the
safeguard
of
the
ship
which
always
represented
one
of
the
to
whose
care
and
protection
the
ship
was
recommended
for
which
reason
it
was
held
sacred
now
and
then
we
find
the
taken
for
the
greek
parasêmon
and
perhaps
sometimes
the
images
of
gods
might
be
represented
on
the
flags
by
some
it
is
placed
also
in
the
prow
but
by
most
authors
of
credit
assigned
to

the

europa
was

and
for
its
tutelary

the
boeotian
ships
had
for
their
tutelar
god
represented
with
a

his
hand
because
he
was
the
founder
of

the
principal

of
boeotia
the
name
of
the
ship
was
usually
taken
from
the
flag
as
appears
in
the
following
passage
of
ovid
where
he
tells
us
his
ship
received
its
name
from

to
represent
as

have
been
evidently
fashioned
to
the
mode
of
the
ancient

it
seems
to
me
however
that
the
whole
of
these
are
no
more
than
symbolism
though
they
are
undoubtedly
symbolism
of
a
high
and
methodical
order
little
removed
from
our
own
armory
personally
i
do
not
consider
them
to
be
armory
but
if
the
word
is
to
be
stretched
to
the
utmost
latitude
to
permit
of
their
inclusion
one
certain
conclusion
follows
that
if
the
heraldry
of
that
day
had
an
orderly
existence
it
most
certainly
came
absolutely
to
an
end
and
disappeared
armory
as
we
know
it
the
armory
of
which
as
a
system
is
traced
back
to
the
period
of
the
crusades
is
no
mere
continuation
by
adoption
it
is
a
distinct
development
and
a
undoubtedly
there
is
a
period
in
the
early
development
of
european
civilisation
which
is
destitute
alike
of
armory
or
of
anything
of
that
nature
the
civilisation
of
europe
is
not
the
civilisation
of
egypt
of
greece
or
of
rome
nor
a
continuation
thereof
but
a
new
development
and
though
each
of
these
in
its
turn
attained
a
high
degree
of
civilisation
and
may
have
separately
developed
a
heraldic
symbolism
much
akin
to
armory
as
a
natural
consequence
of
its
own
development
as
the
armory
we
know
is
a
development
of
its
own
consequent
upon
the
rise
of
our
own
civilisation
nevertheless
it
is
unjustifiable
to
attempt
to
establish
continuity
between
the
ordered
symbolism
of
earlier
but
distinct
civilisations
and
our
own
present
system
of
armory
the
one
and
only
civilisation
which
has
preserved
its
continuity
is
that
of
the
jewish
race
in
spite
of
persecution
the
jews
have
preserved
unchanged
the
minutest
details
of
ritual
law
and
ceremony
the
causes
of
their
suffering
had
heraldry
which
is
and
has
always
been
a
matter
of
pride
formed
a
part
of
their
distinctive
life
we
should
find
it
still
existing
yet
the
fact
remains
that
no
trace
of
jewish
heraldry
can
be
found
until
modern
times
consequently
i
accept
unquestioningly
the
conclusions
of
the
late
planché
somerset
herald
who
unhesitatingly
asserted
that
armory
did
not
exist
at
the
time
of
the
conquest
basing
his
conclusions
principally
upon
the
entire
absence
of
armory

that
period

the
derivation
of
some
of
our
terms
gules
from
the
persian
and
azure
from
the
persian
had
evidently
on
their
part
something
more
than
the
rudiments
of
armory
as
figs
to
will
indicate
one
of
the
best
definitions
of
a
coat
of
arms
that
i
know
though
this
is
not
perfect
requires
the
twofold
qualification
that
the
design
must
be
hereditary
and
must
be
connected
with
armour
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
theory
of
armory
as
we
now
know
it
is
governed
by
those
two
ideas
the
shields
and
the
crests
if
any
decoration
of
a
helmet
is
to
be
called
a
crest
of
the
greeks
and
the
romans
undoubtedly
come
within
the
one
requirement
also
were
they
indicative
of
and
perhaps
intended
to
be
symbolical
of
the
owner
they
lacked
however
heredity
and
we
have
no
proof
that
the
badges
we
read
of
or
the
decorations
of
shield
and
helmet
were
continuous
even
during
a
single
lifetime
certainly
as
we
now
understand
the
term
there
must
be
both
continuity
of
use
if
the
arms
be
impersonal
or
heredity
if
the
arms
be
personal
likewise
must
there
be
their
use
as
decorations
of
the
implements
of
warfare
if
we
exact
these
qualifications
as
essential
armory
as
a
fact
and
as
a
science
is
a
product
of
later
days
and
is
the
evolution
from
the
idea
of
tribal
badges
and
tribal
means
and
methods
of
honour
applied
to
the
decoration
of
implements
of
warfare
it
is
the
conjunction
and
association
of
these
two
distinct
ideas
to
which
is
added
the
no
less
important
idea
of
heredity
the
civilisation
of
england
before
the
conquest
has
left
us
no
trace
of
any
sort
or
kind
that
the
saxons
the
danes
or
the
celts
either
knew
or
practised
armory
so
that
if
armory
as
we
know
it
is
to
be
traced
to
the
period
of
the
norman
conquest
we
must
look
for
it
as
an
adjunct
of
the
altered
civilisation
and
the
altered
law
which
duke
william
brought
into
this
country
such
evidence
as
exists
is
to
the
contrary
and
there
is
nothing
that
can
be
truly
termed
armorial
in
that
marvellous
piece
of
cotemporaneous
workmanship

as
the

the
invasion

of

by

has
been
appealed
to
on
both
sides
of
this
controversy
and
has
certainly
an
important
bearing
on
the
question
of
the
antiquity
of
this
panorama
of
scenes
is
on
probable
grounds
believed
to
have
been
the
work
of
the
conqueror
queen
matilda
and
her
maidens
though
the
french
historian
thierry
and
others
ascribe
it
to
the
empress
maud
daughter
of
henry
iii
the
latest
authorities
suggest
the
likelihood
of
its
having
been
wrought
as
a
decoration
for
the
cathedral
of
bayeux
when
rebuilt
by
william

brother

between

of

cathedral
greatly
favours
this
supposition
this
remarkable
work
of
art
as
carefully
drawn
in
colour
in
by
stothard
is
reproduced
in
the
sixth
volume
of
the
and
more
recently
an
excellent
copy
of
it
from
autotype

has
been
published
by
the
arundel
society
each
of
its
scenes
is
accompanied
by
a
latin
description
the
whole
uniting
into
a
graphic
history
of
the
event
commemorated
we
see
harold
taking
leave
of
edward
the
confessor
riding
to
bosham
with
his
hawk
and
hounds
embarking
for
france
landing
there
and
being
captured
by
the
count
of
ponthieu
redeemed
by
william
of
normandy
and
in
the
midst
of
his
court
aiding
him
against
conan
count
of
bretagne
swearing
on
the
sacred
relics
to
recognise
william
claim
of
succession
to
the
english
throne
and
then
for
england
on
his
return
we
have
him
recounting
the
incidents
of
his
journey
to
edward
the
confessor
to
whose
funeral
obsequies
we
are
next
introduced
then
we
have
harold
receiving
the
crown
from
the
english
people
and
ascending
the
throne
and
william
apprised
of
what
had
taken
place
consulting
with
his
odo
about
invading
england
the
war
preparations
of
the
normans
their
embarkation
their
landing
their
march
to
hastings
and
formation
of
a
camp
there
form
the
subjects
of
successive
scenes
and
finally
we
have
the
battle
of
hastings
with
the
death
of
harold
and
the
flight
of
the
english
in
this
remarkable
piece
of
work
we
have
figures
of
more
than
six
hundred
persons
and
seven
hundred
animals
besides
buildings
and
ships
or
boats
there
are
of
course
also
numerous
shields
of
warriors
of
which
some
are
round
others
and
on
some
of
the
latter
are
rude
figures
of
dragons
or
other
imaginary
animals
as
well
as
crosses
of
different
forms
and
spots
on
one
hand
it
requires
little
imagination
to
find
the
cross
and
the
cross
of
heraldry
prefigured
on
two
of
these
shields
but
there
are
several
fatal
objections
to
regarding
these
figures
as
incipient
namely
that
while
the
most
prominent
persons
of
the
time
are
depicted
most
of
them
repeatedly
none
of
these
is
ever
represented
twice
as
bearing
the
same
device
nor
is
there
one
instance
of
any
resemblance
in
the
rude
designs
described
to
the
bearings
actually
used
by
the
descendants
of
the
persons
in
question
if
a
personage
so
important
and
so
often
depicted
as
the
conqueror
had
borne
arms
they
could
not
fail
to
have
had
a
place
in
a
nearly
contemporary
work
and
more
especially
if
it
proceeded
from
the
needle
of
his
wife
lower
in
his
curiosities
of
heraldry
clinches
the
argument
when
he
writes
nothing
but
disappointment
awaits
the
curious
armorist
who
seeks
in
this
venerable
memorial
the
pale
the
bend
and
other
early
elements
of
arms
as
these
would
have
been
much
more
easily
imitated
with
the
needle
than
the
grotesque
figures
before
alluded
to
we
may
safely
conclude
that
personal
arms
had
not
yet
been
introduced
the
treatise
on
heraldry
proceeds
the
second
crusade
took
place
in
and
in
montfaucon
plates
of
the
no
longer
extant
windows
of
the
abbey
of
denis
representing
that
historical
episode
there
is
not
a
trace
of
an
armorial
ensign
on
any
of
the
shields
that
window
was
probably
executed
at
a
date
when
the
memory
of
that
event
was
fresh
but
in
montfaucon
time
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
was
matter
of
such
moment
in
france
that
it
is
not
to
be
believed
that
the
armorial
figures
on
the
shields
had
there
been
any
would
have
been
left
out
surely
if
anywhere
we
might
have
expected
to
have
found
evidence
of
armory
if
it
had
then
existed
in
the
bayeux
tapestry
neither
do
the
seals
nor
the
coins
of
the
period
produce
a
shield
of
arms
nor
amongst
the
host
of
records
and
documents
which
have
been
preserved
to
us
do
we
find
any
reference
to
armorial
bearings
the
intense
value
and
estimation
attached
to
arms
in
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
centuries
which
has
steadily
though
slowly
declined
since
that
period
would
lead
one
to
suppose
that
had
arms
existed
as
we
know
them
at
an
earlier
period
we
should
have
found
some
definite
record
of
them
in
the
older
chronicles
there
are
no
such
references
and
no
coat
of
arms
in
use
at
a
later
date
can
be
relegated
to
the
conquest
or
any
anterior
period
of
arms
as
we
know
them
there
are
in
the
early
part
of
the
twelfth
century
also
at
the
end
of
the
eleventh
at
the
period
of
the
third
crusade
they
were
in
actual
existence
as
hereditary
decorations
of
weapons
of
warfare
luckily
for
the
purposes
of
deductive
reasoning
human
nature
remains
much
the
same
throughout
the
ages
and
dislike
it
as
we
may
vanity
now
and
vanity
in
olden
days
was
a
great
lever
in
the
determination
of
human
actions
a
noticeable
result
of
civilisation
is
the
effort
to
suppress
any
sign
of
natural
emotion
and
if
the
human
race
at
the
present
day
is
not
unmoved
by
a
desire
to
render
its
appearance
attractive
we
may
rest
very
certainly
assured
that
in
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
this
motive
was
even
more
pronounced
and
still
yet
more
pronounced
at
a
more
remote
distance
of
time
given
an
opportunity
of
ornament
there
you
will
find
ornament
and
decoration
the
ancient
britons
like
the
maories
of
found
their
opportunities
restricted
to
their
skins
the
maories
tattoo
themselves
in
intricate
patterns
the
ancient
britons
used
woad
though
history
is
silent
as
to
whether
they
were
content
with
flat
colour
or
gave
their
preference
to
patterns
it
is
unnecessary
to
trace
the
art
of
decoration
through
embroidery
upon
clothes
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
as
soon
as
shields
came
into
use
they
were
painted
and
decorated
though
i
hesitate
to
follow
practically
the
whole
of
heraldic
writers
in
the
statement
that
it
was
necessity
for
distinction
in
which
accounted
for
the
decoration
of
shields
shields
were
painted
and
decorated
and
helmets
were
adorned
with
all
sorts
of
ornament
long
the
closed
helmet
made
it
impossible
to
recognise
a
man
by
his
facial
peculiarities
and
distinctions
we
have
then
this
underlying
principle
of
vanity
with
its
concomitant
result
of
personal
decoration
and
adornment
we
have
the
relics
of
savagery
which
caused
a
man
to
be
nicknamed
from
some
animal
the
conjunction
of
the
two
produces
the
effort
to
apply
the
opportunity
for
decoration
and
the
vanity
of
the
animal
nickname
to
each
other
we
are
fast
approaching
armory
in
those
days
every
man
fought
and
his
weapons
were
the
most
cherished
of
his
personal
possessions
the
sword
his
father
fought
with
the
shield
his
father
carried
the
banner
his
father
followed
would
naturally
be
amongst
the
articles
a
son
would
be
most
eager
to
possess
herein
are
the
rudiments
of
the
idea
of
heredity
in
armory
and
the
science
of
armory
as
we
know
it
begins
to
slowly
evolve
itself
from
that
point
for
the
son
would
naturally
take
a
pride
in
upholding
the
fame
which
had
clustered
round
the
pictured
signs
and
emblems
under
which
his
father
had
warred
another
element
then
appeared
which
exercised
a
vast
influence
upon
armory
europe
rang
from
end
to
end
with
the
call
to
the
crusades
we
may
or
we
may
not
understand
the
fanaticism
which
gripped
the
whole
of
the
christian
world
and
sent
it
forth
to
fight
the
saracens
that
has
little
to
do
with
it
the
result
was
the
collection
together
in
a
comparatively
restricted
space
of
all
that
was
best
and
noblest
amongst
the
human
race
at
that
time
and
the
spirit
of
emulation
caused
nation
to
vie
with
nation
and
individual
with
individual
in
the
performance
of
illustrious
feats
of
honour
war
was
elevated
to
the
dignity
of
a
sacred
duty
and
the
implements
of
warfare
rose
in
estimation
it
is
easy
to
understand
the
glory
therefore
that
attached
to
arms
and
the
slow
evolution
which
i
have
been
endeavouring
to
indicate
became
a
concrete
fact
and
it
is
due
to
the
crusades
that
the
origin
of
armory
as
we
now
know
it
was
practically
coeval
throughout
europe
and
also
that
a
large
proportion
of
the
charges
and
terms
and
rules
of
heraldry
are
identical
in
all
european
countries
the
next
dominating
influence
was
the
introduction
in
the
early
part
of
the
thirteenth
century
of
the
closed
helmet
this
hid
the
face
of
the
wearer
from
his
followers
and
necessitated
some
means
by
which
the
latter
could
identify
the
man
under
whom
they
served
what
more
natural
than
that
they
should
identify
him
by
the
decoration
of
his
shield
and
the
ornaments
of
his
helmet
and
by
the
coat
or
surcoat
which
he
wore
over
his
coat
of
mail
this
surcoat
had
afforded
another
opportunity
of
decoration
and
it
had
been
decorated
with
the
same
signs
that
the
wearer
had
painted
on
his
shield
hence
the
term
coat
of
arms
this
textile
coat
was
in
itself
a
product
of
the
crusades
the
crusaders
went
in
their
metal
armour
from
the
cooler
atmospheres
of
europe
to
the
intolerable
heat
of
the
east
the
surcoat
and
the
lambrequin
alike
protected
the
metal
armour
and
the
metal
helmet
from
the
rays
of
the
sun
and
the
resulting
discomfort
to
the
wearer
and
were
also
found
very
effective
as
a
preventative
of
the
rust
resulting
from
rain
and
damp
upon
the
metal
by
the
time
that
the
closed
helmet
had
developed
the
necessity
of
distinction
and
the
identification
of
a
man
with
the
pictured
signs
he
wore
or
carried
the
evolution
of
armory
into
the
science
we
know
was
practically
complete
chapter
ii
the
status
and
the
meaning
of
a
coat
of
arms
in
great
britain
it
would
be
foolish
and
misleading
to
assert
that
the
possession
of
a
coat
of
arms
at
the
present
date
has
anything
approaching
the
dignity
which
attached
to
it
in
the
days
of
long
ago
but
one
must
trace
this
through
the
centuries
which
have
passed
in
order
to
form
a
true
estimate
of
it
and
also
to
properly
appreciate
a
coat
of
arms
at
the
present
time
it
is
necessary
to
go
back
to
the
norman
conquest
and
the
broad
dividing
lines
of
social
life
in
order
to
obtain
a
correct
knowledge
the
saxons
had
no
armory
though
they
had
a
very
perfect
civilisation
this
civilisation
william
the
conqueror
upset
introducing
in
its
place
the
system
of
feudal
tenure
with
which
he
had
been
familiar
on
the
continent
briefly
this
feudal
system
may
be
described
as
the
partition
of
the
land
amongst
the
barons
earls
and
others
in
return
for
which
according
to
the
land
they
held
they
accepted
a
liability
of
military
service
for
themselves
and
so
many
followers
these
barons
and
earls
in
their
turn
sublet
the
land
on
terms
advantageous
to
themselves
but
nevertheless
requiring
from
those
to
whom
they
sublet
the
same
military
service
which
the
king
had
exacted
from
themselves
proportionate
with
the
extent
of
the
sublet
lands
other
subdivisions
took
place
but
always
with
the
same
liability
of
military
service
until
we
come
to
those
actually
holding
and
using
the
lands
enjoying
them
subject
to
the
liability
of
military
service
attached
to
those
particular
lands
every
man
who
held
land
under
these
conditions
and
it
was
impossible
to
hold
land
without
them
was
of
the
upper
class
he
was
or
and
of
a
rank
distinct
apart
and
absolutely
separate
from
the
remainder
of
the
population
who
were
at
one
time
actually
serfs
and
for
long
enough
afterwards
of
no
higher
social
position
than
they
had
enjoyed
in
their
period
of
servitude
this
wide
distinction
between
the
upper
and
lower
classes
which
existed
from
one
end
of
europe
to
the
other
was
the
very
root
and
foundation
of
armory
it
can
not
be
too
greatly
insisted
upon
there
were
two
qualitative
terms
gentle
and
simple
which
were
applied
to
the
upper
and
lower
classes
respectively
though
now
becoming
archaic
and
obsolete
the
terms
gentle
and
simple
are
still
occasionally
to
be
met
with
used
in
that
original
sense
and
the
two
adjectives
gentle
and
simple
in
the
everyday
meanings
of
the
words
are
derived
from
and
are
a
growth
from
the
original
usage
with
the
meaning
of
the
upper
and
lower
classes
because
the
quality
of
being
gentle
was
supposed
to
exist
in
that
class
of
life
referred
to
as
gentle
whilst
the
quality
of
simplicity
was
supposed
to
be
an
attribute
of
the
lower
class
the
word
gentle
is
derived
from
the
latin
word
gentilis
meaning
a
man
because
those
were
who
were
not
serfs
serfs
and
slaves
were
nothing
accounted
of
the
word
gentleman
is
a
of
the
word
gentle
and
a
gentleman
was
a
member
of
the
gentle
or
upper
class
and
gentle
qualities
were
so
termed
because
they
were
the
qualities
supposed
to
belong
to
the
gentle
class
a
man
was
not
a
gentleman
even
in
those
days
because
he
happened
to
possess
personal
qualities
usually
associated
with
the
gentle
class
a
man
was
a
gentleman
if
he
belonged
to
the
gentle
or
upper
class
and
not
otherwise
so
that
gentleman
was
an
identical
term
for
one
to
whom
the
word
was
applied
both
being
names
for
members
of
the
upper
class
to
all
intents
and
purposes
at
that
date
there
was
no
middle
class
at
all
the
kingdom
was
the
land
and
the
trading
community
who
dwelt
in
the
towns
were
of
little
account
save
as
milch
kine
for
the
purposes
of
taxation
the
social
position
conceded
to
them
by
the
upper
class
was
little
if
any
more
than
was
conceded
to
the
lower
classes
whose
life
and
liberties
were
held
very
cheaply
briefly
to
sum
up
therefore
there
were
but
the
two
classes
in
existence
of
which
the
upper
class
were
those
who
held
the
land
who
had
military
obligations
and
who
were
noble
or
in
other
words
gentle
therefore
all
who
held
land
were
gentlemen
because
they
held
land
they
had
to
lead
their
servants
and
followers
into
battle
and
they
themselves
were
personally
responsible
for
the
appearance
of
so
many
followers
when
the
king
summoned
them
to
war
now
we
have
seen
in
the
previous
chapter
that
arms
became
necessary
to
the
leader
that
his
followers
might
distinguish
him
in
battle
consequently
all
who
held
land
having
because
of
that
land
to
be
responsible
for
followers
in
battle
found
it
necessary
to
use
arms
the
corollary
is
therefore
evident
that
all
who
held
lands
of
the
king
were
gentlemen
or
noble
and
used
arms
and
as
a
consequence
all
who
possessed
arms
were
gentlemen
for
they
would
not
need
or
use
arms
nor
was
their
armour
of
a
character
upon
which
they
could
display
arms
unless
they
were
leaders
the
leaders
we
have
seen
were
the
or
upper
class
therefore
every
one
who
had
arms
was
a
gentleman
and
every
gentleman
had
arms
but
the
status
of
gentlemen
existed
before
there
were
coats
of
arms
and
the
later
inseparable
connection
between
the
two
was
an
evolution
the
preposterous
prostitution
of
the
word
gentleman
in
these
latter
days
is
due
to
the
almost
universal
attribute
of
human
nature
which
declines
to
admit
itself
as
of
other
than
gentle
rank
and
in
the
eager
desire
to
write
itself
gentleman
it
has
deliberately
accepted
and
ordained
a
meaning
to
the
word
which
it
did
not
formerly
possess
and
has
attributed
to
it
and
allowed
it
only
such
a
definition
as
would
enable
almost
anybody
to
be
included
within
its
ranks
the
word
gentleman
nowadays
has
become
meaningless
as
a
word
in
an
ordinary
vocabulary
and
to
use
the
word
with
its
original
and
true
meaning
it
is
necessary
to
now
consider
it
as
purely
a
technical
term
we
are
so
accustomed
to
employ
the
word
nowadays
in
its
unrestricted
usage
that
we
are
apt
to
overlook
the
fact
that
such
a
usage
is
comparatively
modern
the
following
extract
from
the
right
to
bear
arms
will
prove
that
its
real
meaning
was
understood
and
was
decided
by
law
so
late
as
the
seventeenth
century
to
be
a
man
entitled
to
bear
arms
the
following
case
in
the
earl
marshal
court
which
hung
upon
the
definition
of
the
word
conclusively
proves
my
contention
november
baker
humbly
sheweth
that
having
some
occasion
of
conference
with
adam
spencer
of
broughton
under
the
bleane
co
on
or
about
july
last
the
said
adam
did
in
most
base
and
opprobrious
tearmes
abuse
your
petitioner
calling
him
a
base
lying
fellow
the
defendant
pleaded
that
baker
is
noe
gentleman
and
soe
not
capable
of
redresse
in
this
court
le
neve
clarenceux
is
directed
to
examine
the
point
raised
and
having
done
so
declared
as
touching
the
gentry
of
william
baker
that
robert
cooke
clarenceux
king
of
arms
did
make
a
declaration
may
under
his
hand
and
seale
of
office
that
george
baker
of
london
sonne
of
baker
of
the
same
place
sonne
of
simon
baker
of
feversham
co
was
a
bearer
of
tokens
of
honour
and
did
allow
and
confirm
to
the
said
george
baker
and
to
his
posterity
and
to
the
posterity
of
christopher
baker
these
arms
and
further
le
neve
has
received
proof
that
the
petitioner
william
baker
is
the
son
of
william
baker
of
kingsdowne
co
who
was
the
brother
of
george
baker
and
son
of
christopher
aforesaid
the
judgment
is
not
stated
the
original
confirmation
of
arms
by
cooke
may
may
now
be
seen
in
the
british
for
p
it
has
been
shown
that
originally
practically
all
who
held
land
bore
arms
it
has
also
been
shown
that
armory
was
an
evolution
and
as
a
consequence
it
did
not
start
in
this
country
at
any
rate
as
a
science
with
all
its
rules
and
laws
completely
known
or
promulgated
there
is
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
in
the
earliest
infancy
of
the
science
arms
were
assumed
and
chosen
without
the
control
of
the
crown
and
one
would
not
be
far
wrong
in
assuming
that
so
long
as
the
rights
accruing
from
prior
appropriation
of
other
people
were
respected
a
landowner
finding
the
necessity
of
arms
in
battle
was
originally
at
liberty
to
assume
what
arms
he
liked
that
period
however
was
of
but
brief
duration
for
we
find
as
early
as
from
the
celebrated
scrope
and
grosvenor
case
that
a
man
could
have
obtained
at
that
time
a
definite
right
to
his
arms
that
this
right
could
be
enforced
against
another
and
we
find
what
is
more
important
that
the
crown
and
the
sovereign
had
supreme
control
and
jurisdiction
over
arms
and
that
the
sovereign
could
and
did
grant
arms
from
that
date
down
to
the
present
time
the
crown
both
by
its
own
direct
action
and
by
the
action
of
the
kings
of
arms
to
whom
it
delegates
powers
for
the
purpose
in
letters
patent
under
the
great
seal
specifically
issued
to
each
separate
king
of
arms
upon
his
appointment
has
continued
to
grant
armorial
bearings
some
number
of
early
grants
of
arms
direct
from
the
crown
have
been
printed
in
the
and
some
of
the
earliest
distinctly
recite
that
the
recipients
are
made
noble
and
created
gentlemen
and
that
the
arms
are
given
them
as
sign
of
their
the
class
of
persons
to
whom
grants
of
arms
were
made
in
the
earliest
days
of
such
instruments
is
much
the
same
as
the
class
which
obtain
grants
of
arms
at
the
present
day
and
the
successful
trader
or
merchant
is
now
at
liberty
as
he
was
in
the
reign
of
henry
viii
and
earlier
to
raise
himself
to
the
rank
of
a
gentleman
by
obtaining
a
grant
of
arms
a
family
must
make
its
start
at
some
time
or
other
let
this
start
be
made
honestly
and
not
by
the
appropriation
of
the
arms
of
some
other
man
the
illegal
assumption
of
arms
began
at
an
early
date
and
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
the
crown
which
have
been
more
or
less
continuous
and
repeated
it
has
been
found
that
the
use
of
other
people
arms
has
continued
in
the
reign
of
henry
a
very
stringent
proclamation
was
issued
on
the
subject
and
in
the
reigns
of
queen
elizabeth
and
her
successors
the
kings
of
arms
were
commanded
to
make
perambulations
throughout
the
country
for
the
purpose
of
pulling
down
and
defacing
improper
arms
of
recording
arms
properly
borne
by
authority
and
of
compelling
those
who
used
arms
without
authority
to
obtain
authority
for
them
or
discontinue
their
use
these
perambulations
were
termed
visitations
the
subject
of
visitations
and
in
fact
the
whole
subject
of
the
right
to
bear
arms
is
dealt
with
at
length
in
the
book
to
which
reference
has
been
already
made
namely
the
right
to
bear
arms
the
glory
of
a
descent
from
a
long
line
of
armigerous
ancestors
the
glory
and
the
pride
of
race
inseparably
interwoven
with
the
inheritance
of
a
name
which
has
been
famous
in
history
the
fact
that
some
arms
have
been
designed
to
commemorate
heroic
achievements
the
fact
that
the
display
of
a
particular
coat
of
arms
has
been
the
method
which
society
has
countenanced
of
advertising
to
the
world
that
one
is
of
the
upper
class
or
a
descendant
of
some
ancestor
who
performed
some
glorious
deed
to
which
the
arms
have
reference
the
fact
that
arms
themselves
are
the
very
sign
of
a
particular
descent
or
of
a
particular
rank
have
all
tended
to
cause
a
false
and
fictitious
value
to
be
placed
upon
all
these
pictured
emblems
which
as
a
whole
they
have
never
possessed
and
which
i
believe
they
were
never
intended
to
possess
it
is
they
were
the
prerogative
and
the
sign
of
aristocracy
that
they
have
been
coveted
so
greatly
and
consequently
so
often
assumed
improperly
now
aristocracy
and
social
position
are
largely
a
matter
of
personal
assertion
a
man
assumes
and
asserts
for
himself
a
certain
position
which
position
is
gradually
and
imperceptibly
but
continuously
increased
and
elevated
as
its
assertion
is
reiterated
there
is
no
particular
moment
in
a
man
life
at
the
present
time
the
era
of
the
great
middle
class
at
which
he
visibly
steps
from
a
plebeian
to
a
patrician
standing
and
when
he
has
fought
and
talked
the
world
into
conceding
him
a
recognised
position
in
the
upper
classes
he
naturally
tries
to
obliterate
the
fact
that
he
or
his
people
were
ever
of
any
other
social
position
and
he
hesitates
to
perpetually
date
his
elevation
to
the
rank
of
gentility
by
obtaining
a
grant
of
arms
and
thereby
admitting
that
before
that
date
he
and
his
people
were
plebeian
consequently
he
waits
until
some
circumstance
compels
an
application
for
a
grant
and
the
consequence
is
that
he
thereby
his
actual
technical
gentility
to
a
period
long
subsequent
to
the
recognition
by
society
of
his
position
in
the
upper
classes
arms
are
the
sign
of
the
technical
rank
of
gentility
the
possession
of
arms
is
a
matter
of
hereditary
privilege
which
privilege
the
crown
is
willing
should
be
obtained
upon
certain
terms
by
any
who
care
to
possess
it
who
live
according
to
the
style
and
custom
which
is
usual
amongst
gentle
people
and
so
long
as
the
possession
of
arms
is
a
matter
of
privilege
even
though
this
privilege
is
no
greater
than
is
consequent
upon
payment
of
certain
fees
to
the
crown
and
its
officers
for
so
long
will
that
privilege
possess
a
certain
prestige
and
value
though
this
may
not
be
very
great
arms
have
never
possessed
any
greater
value
than
attaches
to
a
matter
of
privilege
and
with
singularly
few
exceptions
in
every
case
be
it
of
a
peer
or
baronet
of
knight
or
of
simple
gentleman
this
privilege
has
been
obtained
or
has
been
regularised
by
the
payment
at
some
time
or
other
of
fees
to
the
crown
and
its
officers
and
the
difference
between
arms
granted
and
paid
for
yesterday
and
arms
granted
and
paid
for
five
hundred
years
ago
is
the
simple
moral
difference
which
attaches
to
the
dates
at
which
the
payments
were
made
gentility
is
merely
hereditary
rank
emanating
with
all
other
rank
from
the
crown
the
sole
fountain
of
honour
it
is
idle
to
make
the
word
carry
a
host
of
meanings
it
was
never
intended
to
arms
being
the
sign
of
the
technical
rank
of
gentility
the
use
of
arms
is
the
advertisement
of
claim
to
that
gentility
arms
mean
nothing
more
by
coronet
supporters
and
helmet
can
be
indicated
one
place
in
the
scale
of
precedence
by
adding
arms
for
your
wife
you
assert
that
she
also
is
of
gentle
rank
your
quarterings
show
the
other
gentle
families
you
represent
difference
marks
will
show
your
position
in
your
own
family
not
a
very
important
matter
augmentations
indicate
the
deeds
of
your
ancestors
which
the
sovereign
thought
worthy
of
being
held
in
especial
remembrance
the
use
of
a
certain
coat
of
arms
you
assert
your
descent
from
the
person
to
whom
those
arms
were
granted
confirmed
or
that
is
the
beginning
and
end
of
armory
why
seek
to
make
it
mean
more
however
heraldry
is
looked
upon
it
must
be
admitted
that
from
its
earliest
infancy
armory
possessed
two
essential
qualities
it
was
the
definite
sign
of
hereditary
nobility
and
rank
and
it
was
practically
an
integral
part
of
warfare
but
also
from
its
earliest
infancy
it
formed
a
means
of
decoration
it
would
be
a
rash
statement
to
assert
that
armory
has
lost
its
actual
military
character
even
now
but
it
certainly
possessed
it
undiminished
so
long
as
tournaments
took
place
for
the
armory
of
the
tournament
was
of
a
much
higher
standard
than
the
armory
of
the
battlefield
armory
as
an
actual
part
of
warfare
existed
as
a
means
of
decoration
for
the
implements
of
warfare
and
as
such
it
certainly
continues
in
some
slight
degree
to
the
present
day
armory
in
that
bygone
age
although
it
existed
as
the
symbol
of
the
lowest
hereditary
rank
was
worn
and
used
in
warfare
for
purposes
of
pageantry
for
the
indication
of
ownership
for
decorative
purposes
for
the
needs
of
authenticity
in
seals
and
for
the
purposes
of
memorials
in
records
pedigrees
and
monuments
all
those
uses
and
purposes
of
armory
can
be
traced
back
to
a
period
coeval
with
that
to
which
our
certain
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
armory
runs
of
all
those
usages
and
purposes
one
only
that
of
the
use
of
armorial
bearings
in
actual
battle
can
be
said
to
have
come
to
an
end
and
even
that
not
entirely
so
the
rest
are
still
with
us
in
actual
and
extensive
existence
i
am
not
versed
in
the
minutiæ
of
army
matters
or
army
history
but
i
think
i
am
correct
in
saying
that
there
was
no
such
thing
as
a
regular
standing
army
or
a
national
army
until
the
reign
of
henry
viii
prior
to
that
time
the
methods
of
the
feudal
system
supplied
the
wants
of
the
country
the
actual
troops
were
in
the
employment
not
of
the
crown
but
of
the
individual
leaders
the
sovereign
called
upon
and
had
the
right
to
call
upon
those
leaders
to
provide
troops
but
as
those
troops
were
not
in
the
direct
employment
of
the
crown
they
wore
the
liveries
and
heraldic
devices
of
their
leaders
the
leaders
wore
their
own
devices
originally
for
decorative
reasons
and
later
that
they
might
be
distinguished
by
their
particular
followers
hence
the
actual
use
in
battle
in
former
days
of
private
armorial
bearings
and
even
yet
the
practice
is
not
wholly
extinguished
for
the
tartans
of
the
gordon
and
cameron
highlanders
are
a
relic
of
the
usages
of
these
former
days
with
the
formation
of
a
standing
army
and
the
direct
service
of
the
troops
to
the
crown
the
liveries
and
badges
of
those
who
had
formerly
been
responsible
for
the
troops
gave
way
to
the
liveries
and
badges
of
the
crown
the
uniform
of
the
beefeaters
is
a
good
example
of
the
method
in
which
in
the
old
days
a
servant
wore
the
badge
and
livery
of
his
lord
the
beefeaters
wear
the
scarlet
livery
of
the
sovereign
and
wear
the
badge
of
the
sovereign
still
many
people
will
tell
you
by
the
way
that
the
uniform
of
a
beefeater
is
identical
now
with
what
it
was
in
the
days
of
henry
viii
it
is
in
accordance
with
the
strictest
laws
of
armory
the
badge
embroidered
on
the
front
and
back
of
the
tunic
has
changed
and
is
now
the
triple
badge
the
rose
the
thistle
and
the
shamrock
of
the
triple
kingdom
of
great
britain
and
ireland
every
soldier
who
wears
a
scarlet
coat
the
livery
of
his
sovereign
every
regiment
that
carries
its
colours
every
with
a
royal
emblem
thereupon
is
evidence
that
the
use
of
armory
in
battle
still
exists
in
a
small
degree
to
the
present
day
but
circumstances
have
altered
the
troops
no
longer
attack
to
the
cry
of
a
warwick
a
warwick
they
serve
his
majesty
the
king
and
wear
his
livery
and
devices
they
no
longer
carry
the
banner
of
their
officer
whose
servants
and
tenants
they
would
formerly
have
been
the
regiment
cherishes
instead
the
banner
of
the
armorial
bearings
of
his
majesty
within
the
last
few
years
probably
within
the
lifetime
of
all
my
readers
there
has
been
striking
evidence
of
the
manner
in
which
circumstances
alter
everything
the
zulu
war
put
an
end
to
the
practice
of
taking
the
colours
of
a
regiment
into
battle
the
south
african
war
saw
khaki
substituted
universally
for
the
scarlet
livery
of
his
majesty
and
to
have
found
upon
a
south
african
battlefield
the
last
remnant
of
the
armorial
practices
of
the
days
of
chivalry
one
would
have
needed
i
am
afraid
to
examine
the
buttons
of
the
troopers
still
the
scarlet
coat
exists
in
the
army
on
parade
the
life
guards
wear
the
royal
cross
of
george
and
the
star
of
the
garter
the
scots
greys
have
the
royal
saltire
of
andrew
and
the
gordon
highlanders
have
the
gordon
crest
of
the
duke
of
richmond
and
gordon
and
there
are
many
other
similar
instances
there
is
yet
another
point
the
band
of
a
regiment
is
maintained
by
the
officers
of
the
regiment
and
at
the
present
day
in
the
scottish
regiments
the
pipers
have
attached
to
their
pipes
banners
bearing
the
various
armorial
bearings
of
the
officers
of
the
regiment
so
that
perhaps
one
is
justified
in
saying
that
the
use
of
armorial
bearings
in
warfare
has
not
yet
come
to
an
end
the
other
ancient
usages
of
armory
exist
now
as
they
existed
in
the
earliest
times
so
that
it
is
foolish
to
contend
that
armory
has
ceased
to
exist
save
as
an
interesting
survival
of
the
past
it
is
a
living
reality
more
in
use
at
the
present
day
than
ever
before
certainly
the
military
side
of
armory
has
sunk
in
importance
till
it
is
now
utterly
overshadowed
by
the
decorative
but
the
fact
that
armory
still
exists
as
the
sign
and
adjunct
of
hereditary
rank
utterly
forbids
one
to
assert
that
armory
is
dead
and
though
this
side
of
armory
is
also
now
partly
overshadowed
by
its
decorative
use
armory
must
be
admitted
to
be
still
alive
whilst
its
laws
can
still
be
altered
when
if
ever
rank
is
finally
swept
away
and
when
the
crown
ceases
to
grant
arms
and
people
cease
to
use
them
then
armory
will
be
dead
and
can
be
treated
as
the
study
of
a
dead
science
chapter
iii
the
heralds
and
officers
of
arms
the
crown
is
the
fountain
of
honour
having
supreme
control
of
this
control
in
all
civilised
countries
is
one
of
the
appanages
of
sovereignty
but
from
an
early
period
much
of
the
actual
control
has
been
delegated
to
the
heralds
and
kings
of
arms
the
word
herald
is
derived
from
the
an
army
and
strength
or
sway
though
it
has
probably
come
to
us
from
the
german
word
in
the
last
years
of
the
twelfth
century
there
appeared
at
festal
gatherings
persons
mostly
habited
in
richly
coloured
clothing
who
delivered
invitations
to
the
guests
and
side
by
side
with
the
stewards
superintended
the
festivities
many
of
them
were
minstrels
who
after
tournaments
or
battle
extolled
the
deeds
of
the
victors
these
individuals
were
known
in
germany
as
originally
every
powerful
leader
had
his
own
herald
and
the
dual
character
of
minstrel
and
messenger
led
the
herald
to
recount
the
deeds
of
his
master
and
as
a
natural
consequence
of
his
master
ancestors
in
token
of
their
office
they
wore
the
coats
of
arms
of
the
leaders
they
served
and
the
original
status
of
a
herald
was
that
of
a
messenger
when
tournaments
came
into
vogue
it
was
natural
that
some
one
should
examine
the
arms
of
those
taking
part
and
from
this
the
duties
of
the
herald
came
to
include
a
knowledge
of
as
the
sovereign
assumed
or
arrogated
the
control
of
arms
the
right
to
grant
arms
and
the
right
of
judgment
in
disputes
concerning
arms
it
was
but
the
natural
result
that
the
personal
heralds
of
the
sovereign
should
be
required
to
have
a
knowledge
of
the
arms
of
his
principal
subjects
and
should
obtain
something
in
the
nature
of
a
cognisance
or
control
and
jurisdiction
over
those
arms
for
doubtless
the
actions
of
the
sovereign
would
often
depend
upon
the
knowledge
of
his
heralds
the
process
of
development
in
this
country
will
be
more
easily
understood
when
it
is
remembered
that
the
marshal
or
earl
marshal
was
in
former
times
with
the
lord
high
constable
the
first
in
rank
under
the
king
who
usually
led
his
army
in
person
and
to
the
marshal
was
deputed
the
ordering
and
arrangement
of
the
various
bodies
of
troops
regiments
bands
of
retainers
which
ordering
was
at
first
facilitated
and
at
length
entirely
determined
by
the
use
of
various
pictorial
ensigns
such
as
standards
banners
crests
cognisances
and
badges
the
due
arrangement
and
knowledge
of
these
various
ensigns
became
first
the
necessary
study
and
then
the
ordinary
duty
of
these
officers
of
the
marshal
and
their
possession
of
such
knowledge
which
soon
in
due
course
had
to
be
written
down
and
tabulated
secured
to
them
an
important
part
in
mediæval
life
the
result
was
that
at
an
early
period
we
find
them
employed
in
missions
such
as
carrying
on
negotiations
between
contending
armies
on
the
field
bearing
declarations
of
war
challenges
from
one
sovereign
to
another
besides
arranging
the
ceremonial
not
only
of
battles
and
tournaments
but
also
of
coronations
royal
baptisms
marriages
and
funerals
from
the
fact
that
neither
king
of
arms
nor
herald
is
mentioned
as
officiating
in
the
celebrated
scrope
and
grosvenor
case
of
which
very
full
particulars
have
come
down
to
us
it
is
evident
that
the
control
of
arms
had
not
passed
either
in
fact
or
in
theory
from
the
crown
to
the
officers
of
arms
at
that
date
konrad
grünenberg
in
his
roll
of
arms
the
date
of
which
is
gives
a
representation
of
a
literally
here
reproduced
fig
which
includes
the
figure
of
a
herald
long
before
that
date
however
the
position
of
a
herald
in
england
was
well
defined
for
we
find
that
on
january
the
king
appointed
william
bruges
to
be
garter
king
of
arms
it
is
usually
considered
in
england
that
it
would
be
found
that
in
germany
armory
reached
its
highest
point
of
evolution
certainly
german
heraldic
art
is
in
advance
of
our
own
and
it
is
curious
to
read
in
the
latest
and
one
of
the
best
of
german
heraldic
books
that
from
the
very
earliest
times
heraldry
was
carried
to
a
higher
degree
of
perfection
and
thoroughness
in
england
than
elsewhere
and

the
title
of
king
of
arms
or
as
it
was
more
anciently
written
king
of
heralds
was
no
doubt
originally
given
to
the
chief
or
principal
officer
who
presided
over
the
heralds
of
a
kingdom
or
some
principal
province
which
heraldic
writers
formerly
termed
or
else
the
title
was
conferred
upon
the
officer
of

upon
some
particular
order
of
knighthood
garter
king
of

who
is
immediately
attached

and
these
although
separate
and
distinct
offices
are
and
have
been
always
united

the
revival
and
new
modelling
of
the
order
of
the
bath
in
the
reign
of

the
time
of
the
creation
of
his
office

king

was
given
wales
as
his
province
the
intention
being
that
he
should
rank
with
the
others
granting

his

he

not

a
member
as
such
of
the
corporation
of
the

the
members
of

corporation
considered
that
the
gift
of
the
province
of
wales
the
jurisdiction
over
which
they
had
previously
possessed
to
bath
king
was
an
infringement
of
their
chartered
privileges

dispute
was
referred
to
the
law
officers
of

opinion
was
in

of

corporate
body

further
remarks

of

former

over
the
south

and

parts
of

southwards
and

of
the
latter
the
remaining
part
of
the
kingdom
northward
of

river
kings
of

have
been
likewise
assigned

provinces
over
different
kingdoms
and
dominions
and
besides
ulster
king
of
arms
for
ireland
and
lyon
king
of
arms
for
scotland
others
were
nominated
for
particular
provinces
abroad
when
united
to
the
crown
of
england
such
as
and
who
were
perhaps
at
their
first
creation
intended
only
for
the
services
of
the
places
whose
titles
they
bore
when
the
same
should
be
entirely
subdued
to
allegiance
to
the
crown
of
england
and
who
till
that
time
might
have
had
other
provinces
allotted
to
them
either
provisionally
or
temporarily
within
the
realm
of
england
there
were
also
other
kings
of
arms
denominated
from
the
dukedoms
or
earldoms
which
our
princes
enjoyed
before
they
came
to
the
throne
as
and
the
three
first
having
marches
or
provinces
and
the
latter
a
similar
jurisdiction
windsor
likewise
was
a
local
title
but
it
is
doubtful
whether
that
officer
was
ever
a
king
of
arms
also
assumed
that
appellation
from
his
provincial
jurisdiction
over
a
territory
so
called
but
although
anciently
there
were
at
different
periods
several
kings
of
arms
in
england
only
two
provincial
kings
of
arms
have
for
some
ages
been
continued
in
office
viz
clarenceux
and
norroy
whose
provinces
or
marches
are
as
before
observed
separated
by
the
river
trent
the
ancient
limits
of
the
escheaters
when
there
are
only
two
in
the
kingdom
and
the
jurisdiction
of
the
wardens
of
the
forests
is
considered
the
most
ancient
title
being
the
only
one
in
england
taken
from
the
local
situation
of
his
province
unless
should
be
derived
from
the
same
cause
the
title
of
was
anciently
written
and
king
of
arms
of
the
people
residing
in
the
north
being
styled
des
of
the
people
and
not
of
the
kingdom
the
inhabitants
of
the
north
being
called
as
we
are
informed
by
ancient
historians
it
appears
that
there
was
a
king
of
arms
for
the
parts
or
people
on
the
north
of
trent
as
early
as
the
reign
of
edward
from
which
as
sir
henry
spelman
observes
it
may
be
inferred
that
the
southern
eastern
and
western
parts
had
principal
heralds
or
kings
of
arms
although
their
titles
at
that
early
age
can
not
now
be
ascertained
had
not
the
title
of
king
till
after
the
reign
of
edward
ii
it
was
appropriated
to
a
king
of
heralds
expressly
called
del
armorum
del
de
and
norroy
du
and
the
term
likewise
occurs
in
the
pell
rolls
of
the
edward
iii
but
from
that
time
till
the
of
richard
ii
no
farther
mention
is
made
of
any
such
officer
from
which
it
is
probable
a
different
person
enjoyed
the
office
by
some
other
title
during
that
interval
particularly
as
the
office
was
actually
executed
by
other
kings
of
arms
immediately
after
that
period
otharlake
marche
king
of
executed
it
in
the
of
richard
richard
del
brugg
lancaster
king
of
arms
henry
and
and
successively
kings
of
until
the
end
of
that
reign
edward
iv
replaced
this
province
under
a
king
of
arms
and
revived
the
dormant
title
of
but
in
the
statute
of
resumptions
made
henry
a
clause
was
inserted
that
the
same
should
not
extend
to
otherwise
chief
herald
king
of
arms
of
the
north
parts
of
this
realm
of
england
so
appointed
by
king
edward
iv
by
his
letters
patent
bearing
date
july
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
his
reign
it
has
since
continued
without
interruption
king
of
seems
the
next
who
had
the
title
of
king
conferred
upon
him
and
was
so
named
from
one
of
the
royal
badges
of
king
edward
and
it
was
afterwards
given
to
a
herald
and
pursuivant
under
princes
who
bore
the
falcon
as
a
badge
or
cognisance
and
it
is
difficult
to
ascertain
whether
this
officer
was
considered
a
king
herald
or
pursuivant
in
calls
only
a
herald
and
in
mentions
this
officer
as
a
king
of
arms
belonging
to
the
king
of
england
but
it
is
certain
that
in
the
richard
ii
there
was
a
king
of
arms
by
that
appellation
and
so
continued
until
the
reign
of
richard
if
not
later
but
at
what
particular
period
of
time
the
officer
was
discontinued
can
not
be
correctly
ascertained
has
been
considered
by
some
writers
to
have
been
the
title
of
a
king
of
arms
from
an
abbreviation
in
some
old
records
which
might
be
otherwise
translated
there
is
however
amongst
the
protections
in
the
tower
of
london
one
granted
in
the
edward
iii
to
de
windesore
heraldo
armorum
rege
which
seems
to
favour
the
conjecture
and
other
records
might
be
quoted
for
and
against
this
supposition
which
might
have
arisen
through
mistake
in
the
entries
as
they
contradict
one
another
seems
the
next
in
point
of
antiquity
of
creation
but
although
sir
henry
spelman
says
that
king
edward
iv
descended
from
the
of
promoted
to
be
a
king
of
arms
giving
him
perhaps
the
marches
for
his
province
it
is
pretty
clearly
ascertained
that
it
was
of
a
more
early
date
from
the
express
mention
of
rex
and
rex
in
records
of
the
time
of
richard
though
it
may
be
possible
that
it
was
then
only
a
nominal
title
and
did
not
become
a
real
one
till
the
reign
of
edward
as
mentioned
by
spelman
king
of
was
as
the
same
author
informs
us
so
created
by
henry
iv
in
relation
to
his
own
descent
from
the
lancastrian
family
and
the
county
of
lancaster
assigned
to
him
as
his
province
but
contends
that
that
monarch
superadded
the
title
of
lancaster
to
that
of
norroy
or
king
of
the
north
having
as
it
may
be
reasonably
conjectured
given
this
province
north
of
trent
within
which
district
lancaster
was
situated
to
him
who
had
been
formerly
his
officer
of
arms
by
the
title
of
that
dukedom
and
who
might
according
to
custom
in
some
instances
of
former
ages
retain
his
former
title
and
surname
of
heraldship
styling
himself
roy
del
king
of
was
a
title
similar
to
that
of
and
likewise
a
creation
to
the
same
sovereign
henry
who
was
also
earl
of
leicester
before
he
assumed
the
crown
and
was
given
to
a
person
who
was
before
that
time
a
herald
it
appears
that
was
king
richard
and
in
the
of
the
same
reign
is
called
a
of
the
duke
of
guyen
and
but
prior
to
the
coronation
of
henry
iv
he
was
certainly
a
king
of
heralds
and
so
styled
in
a
privy
seal
dated
antecedent
to
that
ceremony
a
similar
instrument
of
the
tenth
year
of
that
monarch
reign
also
mentions
otherwise
king
of
as
it
is
evident
that
during
the
reign
of
henry
king
of
has
under
that
title
the
province
of
the
north
with
good
reason
supposes
that
the
southern
province
or
part
of
that
which
is
now
under
clarenceux
might
at
that
time
be
under
this
especially
as
the
title
of
was
not
in
being
till
after
the
of
henry
when
or
soon
after
the
title
of
might
have
become
extinct
by
the
death
of
that
officer
for
although
king
of
went
over
into
france
with
henry
in
the
third
year
of
his
reign
yet
he
is
not
mentioned
in
the
constitutions
made
by
the
heralds
at
roan
in
the
year
the
next
king
of
arms
in
point
of
creation
is
a
title
generally
supposed
to
have
been
taken
from
in
suffolk
the
castle
at
that
place
being
the
principal
residence
of
the
ancient
earls
of
hereford
who
were
from
thence
though
very
improperly
called
of
in
the
same
manner
as
the
earls
of
pembroke
were
often
named
of
strigoil
and
the
earl
of

that

the
country
about
the

which
duchy
the
name
of

derived

however
contends
that
it
is
a
mistake
in
attributing
the
institution
of
to
king
edward
iv
after
the
honour
of
devolved
as
an
escheat
to
the

upon

untimely
death

found
william
horsely
called
by
this
title
in
the
reign
of
henry
and
also
roger
lygh
under
king
henry
vi
and
it
is
conjectured
that
the
office
of
king
of

not
more
ancient
than
the
reign
of
edward

mentioned
by
historians

originally
the

mention
is
made
upon
record
in
the
of
henry

and
richard
brother
to
edward
who
was
created
duke
of
gloucester
is
said
to
have
had
a
herald
by
that
title
during
the
reign
of
his
brother
and
who
was
attendant
as
such
at
the
funeral
of
that
monarch
in
a
manuscript
in
the
ashmolean
collection
it
is
stated
that
richard
champnay
attended
as
gloucester
king
of
arms
at
the
coronation
of
richard
iii
upon
the
july
following
his
usurpation
of
the
crown
but
it
appears
by
more
authentic
record
that
this
richard
champnay
was
by
the
style
and
title
of
herald

the
september
in
the
first
year
of

and

and

giving
him
licence
and
authority
to
execute
all
and
singular
that
by
law
or
custom
in
former
times
belonged
to
the
office
of
king
of
arms
it
is
supposed
that
the
office
ceased
upon
his
death
which
in
all
probability
took
place
before

frequently
mentioned
as
well
belonging

reign
of
king
henry
who
had
before
his
elevation
to
the
throne
been
earl
of
richmond
contain
many
entries
of
king
of
but
although
somewhat
vague
in
the
description
sufficiently
bear
out
the
conjecture
that
henry
previous
to
his

created
a
new
king
of

by
the
title

no

to
the
two
kings
of

for
the
two
heraldic
provinces
bounded
north
and
south
by
the
river

there
were
also
two
provincial
kings
for

succession
of
officers
by
the

from
that
time

but
from
the
death
of

till

is
uncertain
whether

edward

altered

though

it

than

both

of

no
such

to
have

it
is
doubtful
whether
they
ever

succession
from
their

which
included
what
were
afterwards
called
guyenne
xantoigne
gascoigne
and
some
islands
gave
title
to
a
king
of

as
early
as
the
reign

it
is
conjectured
to
have
been
an
officer
belonging
to
the
black

had

by

whether
the

was
continued

not
be
ascertained

explained
annulled
concerning
the

berry
remarks
in
former
ages
when
honour
and
chivalry
were
at
their
height
these
officers
were
held
in
great
estimation
as
appears
by
the
ceremonies
which
attended
their
creations
which
was
by
the
sovereign
himself
or
by
special
commission
from
him
and
according
to
gerard
leigh
was
after
the
following
manner
the
king
asked
the
person
to
be
so
created
whether
he
were
a
gentleman
of
blood
or
of
second
if
he
was
not
the
king
gave
him
lands
and
fees
and
assigned
him
and
his
heirs
proper
arms
then
as
the
messenger
was
brought
in
by
the
herald
of
the
province
so
the
pursuivant
was
brought
in
by
the
eldest
herald
who
at
the
prince
command
performed
all
the
ceremonies
as
turning
the
coat
of
arms
setting
the
manacles
thereof
on
the
arms
of
the
pursuivant
and
putting
about
his
neck
the
collar
of
ss
and
when
he
was
named
the
prince
himself
took
the
cup
from
the
herald
which
was
gilt
and
poured
the
water
and
wine
upon
the
head
of
the
pursuivant
creating
him
by
the
name
of
and
the
king
when
the
oath
was
administered
gave
the
same
cup
to
the
new
herald
sums
up
the
business
of
a
herald
thus
that
it
was

office
to

number
the
people

matrimony

remarks
that
these
officers
who
are
the
lowest
in
degree
amongst
officers
of
arms
were
as
the
name
implies
followers
marshals
or
messengers
attendant
upon
the
heralds
pursuivants
were
formerly
created
by
the
nobility
who
had
likewise
heralds
of
arms
with
great
ceremony
in
the
following
manner
one
of
the
heralds
wearing
his
master
coat
leading
the
person
to
be
created
pursuivant
by
the
left
hand
and
holding
a
cup
full
of
wine
and
water
in
his
right
came
into
the
presence
of
the
lord
and
master
of
him
who
was
to
be
created
and
of
whom
the
herald
asked
by
what
name
he
would
have
his
pursuivant
called
which
the
lord
having
mentioned
the
herald
then
poured
part
of
the
wine
and
water
upon
his
head
calling
him
by
the
name
so
assigned
to
him
the
herald
then
took
the
coat
of
his
lord
and
put
it
over
his
head
athwart
so
that
part
of
the
coat
made
for
the
arms
before
and
behind
and
the
longer
part
of
it
on
both
sides
of
the
arms
of
the
person
created
and
in
which
way
the
pursuivant
was
always
to
wear
it
this
done
an
oath
of
fidelity
was
administered
to
the
pursuivant
and
the
ceremony
concluded
this
curious
method
of
the
wearing
of
the
tabard
by
a
pursuivant
has
long
since
been
discontinued
if
indeed
it
was
ever
generally
adopted
a
point
on
which
i
have
by
no
means
been
able
to
satisfy
myself
the
appointment
of
heralds
and
pursuivants
of
arms
by
the
nobility
has
long
been
discontinued
and
there
are
now
only
four
pursuivants
belonging
to
the
college
of

viz
the
first
in
point
of
antiquity
of
creation
is
so
styled
from
the
red
cross
of
george
the
patron
saint
of

called
by

edward
in

of
the
french
coat
which
he
assumed
being
blue
so
styled
from
the
red
dragon
one
of
the
supporters
of
the
royal
arms
of
king
henry
vii
who
created
this
pursuivant
and
also
the
badge
of
wales
and
also
instituted
by
henry
and
so
named
from
that
badge
or
cognisance
used
by
him
the
duties
of
a
pursuivant
are
similar
to
those
of
a
herald
he
assists
in
all
public
processions
or
ceremonies
such
as
royal
marriages
funerals
installations
and
has
certain
fees
for
attendance
upon
such
occasions
pursuivants
likewise
receive
fees
upon
creations
of
peers
baronets
and
knights
and
also
donations
for
attending
court
upon
the
principal
festivals
of

period
the
lyon
was
solemnly
crowned
at
his
inauguration
and
vested
with
his
tabard
and
baton
of
office
the
ceremony
was
a
very
elaborate
one
and
is
fully
described
by
sir
james
balfour
in
a
now
in
the

library
there
is
also
an
account
of

of

and
exactly
similar
to
the
imperial
crown
of
scotland
save
that
it
had
no

the

crown
is
the
same
as

the
most
ancient
and
most
noble
order
of

heralds
and
pursuivants
formed
an
important
part
from
very
early
times
not
only
of
the
royal
household
but
also
of
those
of
the
higher
nobility
many
of
whom
had
private
heralds

these
officers

is
a
very
full
list
given
by

preface
to

of

were
or
ultimately
became

of

meet
with

marchmont
snowdon
albany
ross
and
islay
ireland
orkney
and
carrick
are
also
mentioned
as
heralds
but
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
first
and
last
were
ever
more
than
pursuivants
of
the

for
services
rendered
at
the
battle
of

but
we
do
not
find
that
the
office
was
continued
in
scotland
heralds
appear
at
an
early
date
though
none
are
mentioned
as
attending
the
coronation
of

in
nor
is
there
any
account
of
any
such
officers
accompanying

sovereign
when
he
did
homage
to
edward
at
westminster
in
in
the
next
century
however
armorial
bearings
were
quite
well
known
in
scotland
and
there
is
an
entry
in
the

on
october
of
a

of

for
the
making
of
seventeen
armorial

mention
of
a

under

which
i
have
met
with
in

occurs
in

there
is
a
confirmation
under

a

by

to

sir
james
balfour
tells
us
that
the
lyon
and
his
heralds
attended
the
coronation
of
robert
ii
at
holyrood
on
may
but
whether
or
not
this
is
true
and
i
have
not
been
able
to
verify
it
it
is
certain
that
a
lyon
herald
existed
very
shortly
after
that
date
as
in
the
exchequer
rolls
mention
is
made
of
the
payment
of
a
certain
sum
to
such
an
officer
in
in
froissart
says
that
a
herald
was
sent
by
robert
ii
to
london
to
explain
that
the
truce
had
been
infringed
without
his
will
and
against
his
knowledge
and
on
april
a
warrant
was
issued
in
london
for
a
licence
to
lion
heraud
of
the
king
of
scots
authorising
him
to
take
away
a
complete
suit
of
armour
which
he
had
bought
in
that
city
it
is
not
however
till
that
we
find
lyon
accorded
the
royal
style
in
that
year
a
payment
is
made
regi
but
at
the
audit
following
the
battle
of
otterburn
he
is
called
which
suggests
that
he
had
been
slain
on
that
field
the
lyon

in
several
embassies
about
this
period

to
england
and
france

at
or
immediately
after
the
coronation
of

iv
from
onwards
there
is
frequent
mention
of
one
douglas
herald
of
the
king
and
in
he
is
styled
lyon
herald
of
the
german
officers
of
arms
they
like
the
english
are
divided
into
three
classes
known
as
and
these
like
our
own
officers
had
peculiar
titles
for
example
an
austrian
ducal
herald
a
lichtenstein
pursuivant
a
herald
of
the
limmer
palatinate
an
imperial
herald
about
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
official
names
of
the
heralds
fell
into
disuse
they
began
to
make
use
of
their
ancestral
names
with
the
title
of
and
noble
and
honourable
but
this
did
not
last
long
and
the
heralds
found
themselves
thrown
back
into
the
old
ways
into
which
the
knightly
accoutrements
had
already
wandered

later
painted
with

to
whom
they
were
attached
there
was
until
recently
no
official
hat
for
an
officer
of
arms
in
england
and
confirmation
of
this
is
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
dallaway
mentions
a
special
licence
to
wriothesley
garter
giving
him
permission
to
wear
a
cap
on
account
of
his
great
age
obviously
however
a
tabard
requires
other
clothing
to
be
worn
with
it
the
heralds
in
scotland
until
quite
recently
when
making
public
proclamations
were
content
to
appear
in
the
ordinary
boots
and
cloth
trousers
of
everyday
life
this
gave
way
for
a
brief
period
in
which
court
dress
was
worn
below
the
tabard
but
now
as
in
england
the
recognised
uniform
of
a
member
of
the
royal
household
is
worn
in
england
owing
to
the
less
frequent
ceremonial
appearances
of
the
heralds
and
the
more
scrupulous
control
which
has
been
exercised
no
such
anachronisms
as
were
perpetuated
in
scotland
have
been
tolerated
and
it
has
been
customary
for
the
officers
of
arms
to
wear
their
uniform
as
members
of
the
sovereign
household
in
which
uniform
they
attend
the
levees
beneath
the
tabard

making

a
great
deal
of
confusion
has
arisen
between
the
costume
and
the
functions
of
a
herald
and
a
trumpeter
though
the
confusion
has
been
confined
to
the
minds
of
the
uninitiated
and
the
theatrical
stage
the
whole
subject
was
very
amusingly
dealt
with
in

in

article
by
ambrose
lee
bluemantle

the
illustrations
which
he
gives
of
the
relative
dresses
of
the
heralds
and
the
trumpeters
at
different
periods
see
figs
are
interesting
briefly
the
matter
can
be
summed
up
in
the
statement
that
there
never
was
a
trumpeter
who
made
a
proclamation
or
wore
a
tabard
and
there
never
was
a
herald
who
blew
a
trumpet
the
trumpeters
nearly
always
accompanied
the
heralds
to
proclaim
their
presence
and
call
attention
to
their
proclamation

the

played
havoc
with

it

can
be
very
little
doubt
that
the

oversight

to

chapter
v
the
component
parts
of
an
achievement
we
now
come
to
the
science
of
armory
and
the
rules
governing
the
display
of
these
marks
of
honour
the
term
coat
of
arms
as
we
have
seen
is
derived
from
the
textile
garment
or
surcoat
which
was
worn
over
the
armour
and
which
bore
in
embroidery
a
duplication
of
the
design
upon
the
shield
there
can
be
very
little
doubt
that
arms
themselves
are
older
than
the
fact
of
the
surcoat
or
the
term
coat
of
arms
the
entire
heraldic
or
armorial
decoration
which
any
one
is
entitled
to
bear
may
consist
of
many
things
it
must
as
a
minimum
consist
of
a
shield
of
arms
for
whilst
there
are
many
coats
of
arms
in
existence
and
many
still
rightly
in
use
at
the
present
day
to
which
no
crest
belongs
a
crest
in
this
country
can
not
lawfully
exist
without
its
complementary
coat
of
arms
for
the
last
two
certainly
and
probably
nearly
three
centuries
no
original
grant
of
personal
arms
has
ever
been
issued
without
it
containing
the
grant
of
a
crest
except
in
the
case
of
a
grant
to
a
woman
who
of
course
can
not
bear
or
transmit
a
crest
or
else
in
the
case
of
arms
borne
in
right
of
women
or
descent
from
women
through
whom
naturally
no
right
to
a
crest
could
have
been
transmitted
the
grants
which
i
refer
to
as
exceptions
are
those
of
quarterings
and
impalements
to
be
borne
with
other
arms
or
else
exemplifications
following
upon
the
assumption
of
name
and
arms
which
in
fact
and
theory
are
regrants
of
previously
existing
arms
in
which
cases
the
regrant
is
of
the
original
coat
with
or
without
a
crest
as
the
case
may
be
and
as
the
arms
theretofor
existed
grants
of
impersonal
arms
also
need
not
include
a
crest
as
it
has
been
impossible
for
the
last
two
centuries
to
obtain
a
grant
of
arms
without
its
necessarily
accompanying
grant
of
crest
a
decided
distinction
attaches
to
the
lawful
possession
of
arms
which
have
no
crest
belonging
to
them
for
of
necessity
the
arms
must
be
at
least
two
hundred
years
old
bearing
this
in
mind
one
can
not
but
wonder
at
the
actions
of
some
ancient
families
like
those
of
astley
and
pole
who
lawfully
possessing
arms
concerning
which
there
is
and
can
be
no
doubt
or
question
yet
nevertheless
invent
and
use
crests
which
have
no
authority
one
instance
and
one
only
do
i
know
where
a
crest
has
had
a
legitimate
existence
without
any
coat
of
arms
this
case
is
that
of
the
family
of
buckworth
who
at
the
time
of
the
visitations
exhibited
arms
and
crest
the
arms
infringed
upon
those
of
another
family
and
no
sufficient
proof
could
be
produced
to
compel
their
admission
as
borne
of
right
the
arms
were
respited
for
further
proof
while
the
crest
was
allowed
presumably
tentatively
and
whilst
awaiting
the
further
proof
for
the
arms
no
proof
however
was
made
the
arms
and
crest
remained
in
this
position
until
the
year
when
sir
buckworth
whose
father
had
assumed
the
additional
name
of
herne
obtained
a
royal
licence
to
bear
the
name
of
soame
in
addition
to
and
after
those
of
with
the
arms
of
soame
quarterly
with
the
arms
of
buckworth
it
then
became
necessary
to
prove
the
right
to
these
arms
of
buckworth
and
they
were
accordingly
regranted
with
the
trifling
addition
of
an
ermine
spot
upon
the
chevron
consequently
this
solitary
instance
has
now
been
rectified
and
i
can
not
learn
of
any
other
instance
where
these
exceptional
circumstances
have
similarly
occurred
and
there
never
has
been
a
grant
of
a
crest
alone
unless
arms
have
been
in
existence
previously
whilst
arms
may
exist
alone
and
the
decoration
of
a
shield
form
the
only
armorial
ensign
of
a
person
such
need
not
be
the
case
and
it
will
usually
be
found
that
the
armorial
bearings
of
an
ordinary
commoner
consist
of
shield
crest
and
motto
to
these
must
naturally
be
added
the
helmet
and
mantling
which
become
an
essential
to
other
than
an
abbreviated
achievement
when
a
crest
has
to
be
displayed
it
should
be
remembered
however
that
the
helmet
is
not
specifically
granted
and
apparently
is
a
matter
of
inherent
right
so
that
a
person
would
not
be
in
the
wrong
in
placing
a
helmet
and
mantling
above
a
shield
even
when
no
crest
exists
to
surmount
the
helmet
the
motto
is
usually
to
be
found
but
is
not
a
necessity
and
there
are
many
more
coats
of
arms
which
have
never
been
used
with
a
motto
than
shields
which
exist
without
a
crest
sometimes
a
will
be
found
instead
of
or
in
addition
to
a

come
to
be
used
to
signify
a

the
correct

for

emblazonment
is
an
achievement
a
term
most
frequently
employed
to
signify
the
whole
but
which
can
correctly
be
used
to
signify
anything
which
a
man
is
entitled
to
represent
of
an
armorial
character
had
not
the
recent
revival
of
interest
in

taken
place
we
should
have
found
a
firmly
rooted
and
even
yet
more
slipshod
declension
for
a
few
years
ago
the

of
the
uneducated
in
styling

the
shield
the
shield
is
the
most
important
part
of
the
achievement
for
on
it
are
depicted
the
signs
and
emblems
of
the
house
to
which
it
appertains
the
difference
marks
expressive
of
the
cadency
of
the
members
within
that
house
the
augmentations
of
honour
which
the
sovereign
has
conferred
the
quarterings
inherited
from
families
which
are
represented
and
the
impalements
of
marriage
and
it
is
with
the
shield
principally
that
the
laws
of
armory
are
concerned
for
everything
else
is
dependent
upon
the
shield
and
falls
into
comparative
insignificance
alongside
of
it
let
us
first
consider
the
shield
itself
without
reference
to
the
charges
it
carries
a
shield
may
be
depicted
in
any
fashion
and
after
any
shape
that
the
imagination
can
suggest
which
shape
and
fashion
have
been
accepted
at
any
time
as
the
shape
and
fashion
of
a
shield
there
is
no
law
upon
the
subject
the
various
shapes
adopted
in
emblazonments
in
past
ages
and
used
at
the
present
time
in
imitation
of
past
usage
for
luckily
the
present
period
has
evolved
no
special
shield
of
its
own
are
purely
the
result
of
artistic
design
and
have
been
determined
at
the
periods
they
have
been
used
in
heraldic
art
by
no
other
consideration
than
the
particular
theory
of
design
that
has
happened
to
dominate
the
decoration
and
the
means
and
ends
of
such
decoration
of
that
period
the
lozenge
certainly
is
reserved
for
and
indicative
of
the
achievements
of
the
female
sex
but
save
for
this
one
exception
the
matter
may
be
carried
further
and
arms
be
depicted
upon
a
banner
a
parallelogram
a
square
a
circle
or
an
oval
and
even
then
one
would
be
correct
for
the
purposes
of
armory
in
describing
such
figures
as
shields
on
all
occasions
on
which
they
are
made
the
vehicles
for
the
emblazonment
of
a
design
which
properly
and
originally
should
be
borne
upon
a
shield
let
no
one
think
that
a
design
ceases
to
be
a
coat
of
arms
if
it
is
not
displayed
upon
a
shield
many
people
have
thought
to
evade
the
authority
of
the
crown
as
the
arbiter
of
and
the
penalties
of
taxation
imposed
by
the
revenue
by
using
designs
without
depicting
them
upon
a
shield
this
little
deception
has
always
been
borne
in
mind
for
we
find
in
the
royal
warrants
of
queen
elizabeth
commanding
the
visitations
that
the
king

the

throughout
the

of

has
also
varied
between
wide
extremes
and
at
no

has
any
one
particular
shape
been
assigned
to
or
peculiar
to
any
country

or
condition
save
possibly
with
one
exception
namely
that
the
use
of
the
cartouche
or
oval
seems
to
have
been
very
nearly
universal
with
ecclesiastics
in
france
spain
and
italy
though
never
reserved
exclusively
for
their
use
probably
this
was
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
church
to
get
away
from
the
military
character
of
the
shield
it
is
in
keeping
with
the
rule
by
which
even
at
the
present
day
a
bishop
or
a
cardinal
bears
neither
helmet
nor
crest
using
in
place
thereof
his
ecclesiastical
mitre
or
tasselled
hat
and
by
which
the
clergy
both
abroad
and
in
this
country
seldom
made
use
of
a
crest
in
depicting
their
arms
a
clergyman
in
this
country
however
has
never
been
denied
the
right
of
using
a
crest
if
he
possesses
one
and
chooses
to
display
it
until
he
reaches
episcopal
rank
a
grant
of
arms
to
a
clergyman
at
the
present
day
depicts
his
achievement
with
helmet
mantling
and
crest
in
identical
form
with
those
adopted
for
any
one
else
but
the
laws
of
armory
official
and
amateur
have
always
denied
the
right
to
make
use
of
a
crest
to
bishop
archbishop
and
cardinal
at
the
present
day
if
a
grant
of
arms
is
made
to
a
bishop
of
the
established
church
the
emblazonment
at
the
head
of
his
patent
consists
of
shield
and
mitre
only
the
laws
of
the
church
of
england
however
require
no
vow
of
celibacy
from
its
ecclesiastics
and
consequently
the
descendants
of
a
bishop
would
be
placed
in
the
position
of
having
no
crest
to
display
if
the
bishop
and
his
requirements
were
alone
considered
so
that
in
the
case
of
a
grant
to
a
bishop
the
crest
is
granted
for
his
descendants
in
a
separate
clause
being
depicted
by
itself
in
the
body
of
the
patent
apart
from
the
emblazonment
in
the
margin
hereof
which
in
an
ordinary
patent
is
an
emblazonment
of
the
whole
achievement
a
similar
method
is
usually
adopted
in
cases
in
which
the
actual
patentee
is
a
woman
and
where
by
the
limitations
attached
to
the
patent
being
extended
beyond
herself
males
are
brought
in
who
will
bear
the
arms
granted
to
the
patentee
as
their
pronominal
arms
in
these
cases
the
arms
of
the
patentee
are
depicted
upon
a
lozenge
at
the
head
of
the
patent
the
crest
being
depicted
separately
elsewhere
whilst
shields
were
actually
used
in
warfare
the
utilitarian
article
largely
governed
the
shape
of
the
artistic
representation
but
after
the
fifteenth
century
the
latter
gradually
left
the
beaten
track
of
utility
and
passed
wholly
into
the
cognisance
of
art
and
design
the
earliest
shape
of
all
is
the
long
narrow
shape
which
is
now
but
seldom
seen
this
was
curved
to
protect
the
body
which
it
nearly
covered

an
interesting
example
of
this
is
to
be
found

in

to
attending
to

frequently
strengthened

those
parts
which
were
more

exposed
to
blows

pressure
these
clasps

had
no
other
object
than
to
make
the

stronger
and
more
durable

later
on
their
nature
was
misunderstood
they
were
treated
and
used
as
genuine
heraldic
charges
and
stereotyped
into
hereditary
designs
the
long
strips
with
which
the
edge
was

called

the
shield
was
called
the
buckelrîs

into

from
this
class
of

the
most
varied
shapes

developed

decidedly
smaller

the
earlier
gothic
shields

only
about

a

were

on

side

decoration
symmetrically
repeated

the
sinister
side
of
the
shield

by
so
doing
transformed
a
useful
fact
into
a
matter
of
mere
artistic
design
doubtless
it
was
argued
that
if
indentations
were
correct
at
one
point
in
the
outline
they
were
correct
at
another
and
when
once
the
actual
fact
was

imagination

designers

no

the

explained

a
remark
of
eve
in
the
able
book
which
he
has
recently
published
under
the
title
of
decorative
heraldry
in
which
alluding
to
heraldic
art
in
general
he
says
with
the
restoration
heraldry
naturally
became
again
conspicuous
with
the
worst
form
of
the
renaissance
character
in
full
sway
the
last
vestiges
of
the
gothic
having
disappeared
indeed
the
contempt
with
which
the
superseded
style
was
regarded
amounted
to
fanaticism
and
explains
in
a
measure
how
so
much
of
good
could
be
relinquished
in
favour
of
so
weak
a
successor
later
came
the
era
of
gilded
embellishments

flowing
palms
of

with
grinning
heads

not
particularly
well
known
to
the
public
inasmuch
as
its
circulation
was
entirely
confined
to
heraldic
artists
engravers
and
amongst
these
handicraftsmen
its
reputation
was
and
is
great
with
the
school
of
design
it
adopted
little
or
no
sympathy
now
exists
but
a
short
time
ago
how
short
many
of
those
who
are
now
vigorous
advocates
of
the
gothic
and
mediæval
styles
would
be
startled
to
realise
were
they
to
recognise
actual
facts
no
other
style
was
known
or
considered
by
the
public
as
examples
of
that
style
the
plates
of
knight
and
rumley
were
admittedly
far
in
advance
of
any
other
book
and
as
specimens
of
copperplate
engraving
they
are
superb
figs
and
show
typical
examples
of
escutcheons
from
knight
and
rumley
and
as
the
volume
was
in
the
hands
of
most
of
the
heraldic
handicraftsmen
it
will
be
found
that
this
type
of
design
was
constantly
to
be
met
with
the
external
decoration
of
the
shield
was
carried
to
great
lengths
and
fig
found
many
admirers
and
users
amongst
the
gallant
of
the
kingdom
in
fact
so
far
was
the
idea
carried
that
a
trophy
of
military
weapons
was
actually
granted
by
patent
as
part
of
the
supporters
of
the
earl
of
bantry
fig
from
the
same
source
is
the
military
equivalent
these
plates
are
interesting
as
being
some
of
the
examples
from
which
most
of
the
heraldic
handicraft
of
a
recent
period
was
adapted
the
official
shield
eventually
stereotyped
itself
into
a
shape
akin
to
that
shown
in
fig
though
nowadays
considerable
latitude
is
permitted
for
paintings
which
are
not
upon
patents
the
design
of
the
shield
rests
with
the
individual
taste
of
the
different
officers
of
arms
and
recently
some
of
the
work
for
which
they
have
been
responsible
has
reached
a
high
standard
judged
even
by
the
strictest
canons
of
art
in
scotland
until
very
recently
the
actual
workmanship
of
the
emblazonments
which
were
issued
from
lyon
office
was
so
wretchedly
poor
that
one
is
hardly
justified
in
taking
them
into
consideration
as
a
type
with
the
advent
into
office
of
the
present
lyon
king
of
arms
sir
james
balfour
paul
a
complete
change
has
been
made
and
both
the
workmanship
and
design
of
the
paintings
upon
the
patents
of
grant
and
matriculation
and
also
in
the
lyon
register
have
been
examples
of
everything
that
could
be
desired
chapter
vii
the
field
of
a
shield
and
the
heraldic
tinctures
the
shield
itself
and
its
importance
in
armory
is
due
to
its
being
the
vehicle
whereon
are
elaborated
the
pictured
emblems
and
designs
which
constitute
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
theoretically
all
shields
are
of
equal
value
saving
that
a
shield
of
more
ancient
date
is
more
estimable
than
one
of
recent
origin
and
the
shield
of
the
head
of
the
house
takes
precedence
of
the
same
arms
when
differenced
for
a
younger
member
of
the
family
a
shield
crowded
with
quarterings
is
interesting
inasmuch
as
each
quartering
in
the
ordinary
event
means
the
representation
through
a
female
of
some
other
family
or
branch
thereof
but
the
real
value
of
such
a
shield
should
be
judged
rather
by
the
age
of
the
single
quartering
which
represents
the
strict
male
descent
male
upon
male
and
a
simple
coat
of
arms
without
quarterings
may
be
a
great
deal
more
ancient
and
illustrious
than
a
shield
crowded
with
coat
upon
coat
a
fictitious
and
far
too
great
estimation
is
placed
upon
the
right
to
display
a
long
string
of
quarterings
in
reality
quarterings
are
no
more
than
accidents
because
they
are
only
inherited
when
the
wife
happens
to
be
an
heiress
in
blood
it
is
quite
conceivable
that
there
may
be
families
in
fact
there
are
such
families
who
are
able
to
begin
their
pedigrees
at
the
time
of
the
conquest
and
who
have
married
a
long
succession
of
noble
women
all
of
the
highest
birth
but
yet
none
of
whom
have
happened
to
be
heiresses
consequently
the
arms
though
dating
from
the
earliest
period
at
which
arms
are
known
would
remain
in
their
simple
form
without
the
addition
of
a
solitary
quartering
on
the
other
hand
i
have
a
case
in
mind
of
a
marriage
which
took
place
some
years
ago
the
husband
is
the
son
of
an
alien
whose
original
position
if
report
speaks
truly
was
that
of
a
pauper
immigrant
his
wealth
and
other
attributes
have
placed
him
in
a
good
social
position
but
he
has
no
arms
and
as
far
as
the
world
is
aware
no
ancestry
whatever
let
us
now
consider
his
wife
family
starting
soon
after
the
conquest
its
descendants
obtained
high
position
and
married
heiress
after
heiress
and
before
the
commencement
of
this
century
had
amassed
a
shield
of
quarterings
which
can
readily
be
proved
to
be
little
short
of
a
hundred
in
number
probably
the
number
is
really
much
greater
a
large
family
followed
in
one
generation
and
one
of
the
younger
sons
is
the
ancestor
of
the
aforesaid
wife
but
the
father
of
this
lady
never
had
any
sons
and
though
there
are
many
males
of
the
name
to
carry
on
the
family
in
the
senior
line
and
also
in
several
younger
branches
the
wife
by
the
absence
of
brothers
happens
to
be
a
coheir
and
as
such
she
transmits
to
her
issue
the
right
to
all
the
quarterings
she
has
inherited
if
the
husband
ever
obtains
a
grant
of
arms
the
date
of
them
will
be
subsequent
to
the
present
time
but
supposing
such
a
grant
to
be
obtained
the
children
will
inevitably
inherit
the
scores
of
quarterings
which
belong
to
their
mother
now
it
would
be
ridiculous
to
suppose
that
such
a
shield
is
better
or
such
a
descent
more
enviable
than
the
shield
of
a
family
such
as
i
first
described
quarterings
are
all
very
well
in
their
way
but
their
glorification
has
been
carried
too
far
a
shield
which
displays
an
augmentation
is
of
necessity
more
honourable
than
one
without
at
the
same
time
no
scale
of
precedence
has
ever
been
laid
down
below
the
rank
of
esquires
and
if
such
precedence
does
really
exist
at
all
it
can
only
be
according
to
the
date
of
the
grant
here
in
england
the
possession
of
arms
carries
with
it
no
style
or
title
and
nothing
in
his
designation
can
differentiate
the
position
of
scrope
of
danby
the
male
descendant
of
one
of
the
oldest
families
in
this
country
whose
arms
were
upheld
in
the
scrope
and
grosvenor
controversy
in
or
daubeney
of
cote
from
a
smith
whose
known
history
may
have
commenced
at
the
foundling
hospital
twenty
years
ago
in
this
respect
english
usage
stands
apart
for
whilst
a
german
is
von
and
a
frenchman
was
de
if
of
noble
birth
there
is
no
such
apparent
distinction
in
england
and
never
has
been
the
result
has
been
that
the
technical
nobility
attaching
to
the
possession
of
arms
is
overlooked
in
this
country
on
the
continent
it
is
usual
for
a
patent
creating
a
title
to
contain
a
grant
of
the
arms
because
it
is
recognised
that
the
two
are
inseparable
this
is
not
now
the
case
in
england
where
the
grant
of
arms
is
one
thing
and
the
grant
of
the
title
another
and
where
it
is
possible
as
in
the
case
of
lord
leonards
to
possess
a
peerage
without
ever
having
obtained
the
first
step
in
rank
which
is
nobility
or
gentility
the
foregoing
is
in
explanation
of
the
fact
that
except
in
the
matter
of
date
all
shields
are
equal
in
value
so
much
being
understood
it
is
possible
to
put
that
consideration
on
one
side
and
speaking
from
the
artistically
technical
point
of
view
the
remark
one
often
hears
becomes
correct
that
the
simpler
a
coat
of
arms
the
better
the
remark
has
added
truth
from
the
fact
that
most
ancient
coats
of
arms
were
simple
and
many
modern
coats
are
far
from
being
worthy
of
such
a
description
a
coat
of
arms
must
consist
of
at
least
one
thing
to
wit
the
field
this
is
equivalent
in
ordinary
words
to
the
colour
of
the
ground
of
the
shield
a
great
many
writers
have
asserted
that
every
coat
of
arms
must
consist
of
at
least
the
field
and
a
charge
though
most
have
mentioned
as
a
solitary
exception
the
arms
of
brittany
which
were
simply
ermine
a
plain
shield
of
ermine
fig
was
borne
by
john
of
brittany
earl
of
richmond
though
some
of
his
predecessors
had
relegated
the
arms
of
brittany
to
a
quarter
ermine
upon
more
elaborate
escutcheons
fig
this
idea
as
to
arms
of
one
tincture
was
however
exploded
in
woodward
and
burnett
treatise
on
heraldry
where
no
less
than
forty
different
examples
are
quoted
the
writer
continues
there
is
another
use
of
a
plain
red
shield
which
must
not
be
omitted
in
the
full
quartered
coat
of
some
high
sovereign
princes
of
germany
saxony
duchies
brandenburg
prussia
bavaria
anhalt
appears
a
plain
red
quartering
this
is
known
as
the
or
quarter
and
is
indicative
of
royal
prerogatives
it
usually
occupies
the
base
of
the
shield
and
is
often
diapered
illustration
fig
arms
of
john
de
montfort
otherwise
de
bretagne
duke
of
brittany
and
earl
of
richmond
from
his
seal
but
in
spite
of
the
lengthy
list
which
is
quoted
in
woodward
and
burnett
the
fact
remains
that
only
one
british
instance
is
included
the
family
of
berington
of
chester
on
the
authority
of
harleian
manuscript
no
is
said
to
bear
a
plain
shield
of
azure
personally
i
doubt
this
coat
of
arms
for
the
berington
family
of
chester
which
is
probably
connected
with
the
neighbouring
family
in
shropshire
who
in
later
times
certainly
used
very
different
arms
the
plain
shield
of
ermine
is
sometimes
to
be
found
as
a
quartering
for
brittany
in
the
achievement
of
those
english
families
who
have
the
right
to
quarter
the
royal
arms
but
i
know
of
no
other
british
case
in
which
either
as
a
quartering
or
as
a
pronominal
coat
arms
of
one
tincture
exist
but
there
are
many
coats
which
have
no
charge
the
distinctive
device
consisting
of
the
partition
of
the
shield
in
some
recognised
heraldic
method
into
two
or
more
divisions
of
different
tinctures
amongst
such
coats
may
be
mentioned
the
arms
of
waldegrave
which
are
simply
party
per
pale
argent
and
gules
drummond
of
megginch
whose
arms
are
simply
party
per
fess
wavy
or
and
gules
and
the
arms
of
boyle
which
are
per
bend
embattled
argent
and
gules
the
arms
of
berners
which
are
quarterly
or
and
vert
are
another
example
as
are
the
arms
of
campbell
the
first
quarter
in
the
duke
of
argyll
achievement
which
are
gyronny
or
and
sable
the
coat
bendy
argent
and
gules
the
ancient
arms
of
talbot
which
are
still
borne
as
a
quartering
by
the
earl
of
shrewsbury
waterford
and
talbot
and
the
coat
chequy
or
and
azure
a
quartering
for
warren
which
is
still
borne
by
the
house
of
howard
all
come
within
the
same
category
there
are
many
other
coats
of
this
character
which
have
no
actual
charge
upon
them
the
colour
of
the
shield
is
termed
the
field
when
it
consists
of
only
one
colour
and
when
it
consists
of
more
than
one
colour
the
two
together
compose
the
field
the
field
is
usually
of
one
or
more
of
the
recognised
metals
colours
or
furs
the
metals
are
gold
and
silver
these
being
termed
or
and
argent
the
colours
which
are
really
the
tinctures
if
this
word
is
to
be
used
correctly
are
gules
red
azure
blue
vert
green
purpure
purple
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
is
not
really
a
colour
black
which
is
known
as
sable
the
metal
gold
otherwise
or
is
often
represented
in
emblazonments
by
yellow
as
a
matter
of
fact
yellow
has
always
been
used
for
gold
in
the
register
books
of
the
college
of
arms
and
lyon
office
has
recently
reverted
to
this
practice
in
ancient
paintings
and
emblazonments
the
use
of
yellow
was
rather
more
frequent
than
the
use
of
gold
but
gold
at
all
times
had
its
use
and
was
never
discarded
gold
seems
to
have
been
usually
used
upon
ancient
patents
whilst
yellow
was
used
in
the
registrations
of
them
retained
in
the
offices
of
arms
but
i
know
of
no
instance
in
british
armory
in
which
the
word
yellow
has
been
used
in
a
blazon
to
represent
any
tint
distinct
from
gold
with
regard
to
the
other
metal
silver
or
as
it
is
always
termed
argent
the
same
variation
is
found
in
the
usage
of
silver
and
white
in
representing
argent
that
we
find
in
yellow
and
gold
though
we
find
that
the
use
of
the
actual
metal
silver
in
emblazonment
does
not
occur
to
anything
like
the
same
extent
as
does
the
use
of
gold
probably
this
is
due
to
the
practical
difficulty
that
no
one
has
yet
discovered
a
silver
medium
which
does
not
lose
its
colour
the
use
of
aluminium
was
thought
to
have
solved
the
difficulty
but
even
this
loses
its
brilliancy
and
probably
its
usage
will
never
be
universally
adopted
this
is
a
pity
for
the
use
of
gold
in
emblazonments
gives
a
brilliancy
in
effect
to
a
collection
of
which
it
is
a
pity
can
not
be
extended
by
an
equivalent
usage
of
silver
the
use
of
silver
upon
the
patents
at
the
college
of
arms
has
been
discontinued
some
centuries
though
aluminium
is
still
in
use
in
lyon
office
argent
is
therefore
usually
represented
either
by
leaving
the
surface
untouched
or
by
the
use
of
chinese
white
i
believe
i
am
the
first
heraldic
writer
to
assert
the
existence
of
the
heraldic
colour
of
white
in
addition
to
the
heraldic
argent
years
ago
i
came
across
the
statement
that
a
white
label
belonged
only
to
the
royal
family
and
could
be
used
by
no
one
else
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
though
i
have
searched
high
and
low
i
can
not
find
the
authority
for
the
statement
nor
can
i
learn
from
any
officer
of
arms
that
the
existence
of
such
a
rule
is
asserted
but
there
is
this
curious
confirmation
that
in
the
warrants
by
which
the
various
labels
are
assigned
to
the
different
members
of
the
royal
family
the
labels
are
called
white
labels
now
the
label
of
the
prince
of
wales
is
of
three
points
and
is
plain
heraldry
knows
nothing
of
the
black
lines
which
in
drawing
a
coat
of
arms
usually
appear
for
the
outline
of
a
charge
in
older
work
such
lines
are
absent
in
any
case
they
are
only
mere
accidents
of
draughtsmanship
bearing
this
in
mind
and
bearing
in
mind
that
the
sinister
supporter
of
the
prince
of
wales
is
a
unicorn
argent
how
on
earth
is
a
plain
label
of
argent
to
be
depicted
thereupon
now
it
is
necessary
also
that
the
label
shall
be
placed
upon
the
crest
which
is
a
lion
statant
guardant
or
crowned
with
the
coronet
of
the
prince
and
upon
the
dexter
supporter
which
is
another
golden
lion
to
place
an
argent
label
upon
either
is
a
flat
violation
of
the
rule
which
requires
that
metal
shall
not
be
placed
upon
metal
nor
colour
upon
colour
but
if
the
unicorn
is
considered
argent
which
it
is
it
would
if
really
depicted
in
silver
be
quite
possible
to
paint
a
white
label
upon
it
for
the
distinction
between
white
and
silver
is
marked
and
a
white
label
upon
a
gold
lion
is
not
metal
upon
metal
quite
recently
a
still
further
and
startling
confirmation
has
come
under
my
notice
in
the
grant
of
a
crest
to
thomas
mowbray
earl
of
nottingham
the
coronet
which
is
to
encircle
the
neck
of
the
leopard
is
distinctly
blazoned
argent
the
label
to
which
he
is
previously
said
to
have
had
a
just
hereditary
right
is
as
distinctly
blazoned
white
and
the
whole
grant
is
so
short
that
inadvertence
could
hardly
be
pleaded
as
an
explanation
for
the
distinction
in
blazon
instances
of
an
official
exemplification
of
coats
of
arms
with
labels
are
not
uncommon
because
the
label
in
some
number
of
families
for
example
courtenay
and
and
barrington
has
become
stereotyped
into
a
charge
in
none
of
these
cases
however
is
it
either
argent
or
white
but
instances
of
the
exemplification
of
a
coat
of
arms
bearing
a
label
as
a
mark
of
cadency
are
outside
the
members
of
the
royal
family
distinctly
rare
they
are
necessarily
so
because
outside
the
royal
family
the
label
is
merely
the
temporary
mark
of
the
eldest
son
or
grandson
during
the
lifetime
of
the
head
of
the
house
and
the
necessity
for
the
exemplification
of
the
arms
of
an
eldest
son
can
seldom
occur
the
one
circumstance
which
might
provide
us
with
the
opportunity
is
the
exemplification
consequent
upon
a
change
of
name
and
arms
by
an
eldest
son
during
the
lifetime
of
his
father
but
this
very
circumstance
fails
to
provide
it
because
the
exemplification
only
follows
a
change
of
arms
and
the
arms
being
changed
there
no
longer
exists
the
necessity
for
a
mark
of
cadency
so
that
instances
of
the
official
use
of
a
label
for
cadency
are
rare
but
of
such
as
occur
i
can
learn
of
none
which
has
received
official
sanction
which
blazons
the
label
white
there
is
however
one
coat
which
is
said
to
have
a
label
argent
as
a
charge
this
is
the
coat
of
which
is
quoted
in
papworth
upon
the
authority
of
one
of
the
harleian
manuscripts
as
follows

two
other
colours
will
be
found
in
nearly
all
of
english
armory
these
are
murrey
or
sanguine
and
orange
or
tenné
the
exact
tint
of
murrey
is
between
gules
and
purpure
and
tenné
is
an
colour
they
are
both
stains
and
were
perhaps
invented
by
the
old
heralds
for
the
perpetration
of
their
preposterous
system
of
abatements
which
will
be
found
set
out
in
full
in
the
old
heraldry
books
but
which
have
yet
to
be
found
occurring
in
fact
the
subject
of
abatements
is
one
of
those
pleasant
little
insanities
which
have
done
so
much
to
the
detriment
of
heraldry
one
and
one
only
can
be
said
to
have
had
the
slightest
foundation
in
fact
that
was
the
entire
reversal
of
the
escutcheon
in
the
ceremony
of
degradation
following
upon
attainder
for
high
treason
even
this
however
was
but
temporary
for
a
man
forfeited
his
arms
entirely
by
attainder
they
were
torn
down
from
his
banner
of
knighthood
they
were
erased
in
the
records
of
the
college
of
arms
but
on
that
one
single
occasion
when
he
was
drawn
upon
a
hurdle
to
the
place
of
his
execution
they
are
said
to
have
been
painted
reversed
upon
paper
which
paper
was
fastened
to
his
breast
but
the
arms
then
came
to
an
end
and
his
descendants
possessed
none
at
all
they
certainly
had
not
the
right
to
depict
their
shield
upside
down
even
if
they
had
cared
to
display
such
a
monstrosity
unless
and
until
the
attainder
was
reversed
arms
like
a
title
were
void
and
the
proof
of
this
is
to
be
found
in
the
many
regrants
of
arms
made
in
cases
where
the
attainder
has
remained
as
in
the
instances
of
the
earl
of
stafford
and
the
ancestor
of
the
present
lord
barnard
but
that
any
person
should
have
been
supposed
to
have
been
willing
to
make
use
of
arms
carrying
an
abatement
is
preposterous
and
no
instance
of
such
usage
is
known
rather
would
a
man
decline
to
bear
arms
at
all
and
that
any
one
should
have
imagined
the
existence
of
a
person
willing
to
advertise
himself
as
a
drunkard
or
an
adulterer
with
variations
in
the
latter
case
according
to
the
personality
of
his
partner
in
guilt
is
idiotic
in
the
extreme
consequently
as
no
example
of
an
abatement
has
ever
been
found
one
might
almost
discard
the
stains
of
murrey
and
tenné
were
it
not
that
they
were
largely
made
use
of
for
the
purposes
of
liveries
in
which
usage
they
had
no
such
objectionable
meaning
at
the
present
day
scarlet
or
gules
being
appropriated
to
the
royal
family
for
livery
purposes
other
people
possessing
a
shield
of
gules
are
required
to
make
use
of
a
different
red
and
though
it
is
now
termed
chocolate
or
claret
colour
by
the
utilitarian
language
of
the
day
it
is
in
reality
nothing
more
than
the
old
sanguine
or
murrey
of
i
can
learn
of
but
one
livery
at
the
present
day
i
refer
to
the
coats
used
by
the
hunt
servants
of
lord
fitzhardinge
and
now
worn
by
the
hunt
servants
of
the
old
berkeley
country
near
london
of
this
it
is
interesting
to
note
the
curious
legend
that
the
pink
of
the
hunting
field
is
not
due
to
any
reasons
of
optical
advantage
but
to
an
entirely
different
reason
formerly
no
man
might
hunt
even
on
his
own
estate
until
he
had
had
licence
of
free
warren
from
the
crown
consequently
he
merely
hunted
by
the
pleasure
of
the
crown
taking
part
in
what
was
exclusively
a
royal
sport
by
royal
permission
and
for
this
royal
sport
he
wore
the
king
livery
of
scarlet
this
being
the
case
it
is
a
curious
anomaly
that
although
the
livery
of
the
only
royal
pack
recently
in
existence
the
royal
buck
hounds
was
scarlet
and
gold
the
master
wore
a
green
coat
the
legend
may
be
a
fallacy
inasmuch
as
scarlet
did
not
become
the
royal
livery
until
the
accession
of
the
stuarts
but
it
is
by
no
means
clear
to
what
date
the
scarlet
hunting
coat
can
be
traced
there
is
however
one
undoubted
instance
of
the
use
of
sanguine
for
the
field
of
a
coat
of
arms
namely
the
arms
of
clayhills
of
invergowrie
which
are
properly
matriculated
in
lyon
register
to
these
colours
german
heraldry
has
added
brown
this
apparently
is
different
from
the
english
sanguine
as
a
different
hatching
has
been
invented
for
it
orange
here
also
a
separate
hatching
from
the
one
to
represent
tenné
has
been
invented
and
the
colour
of
nature
proper
these
doubtless
are
not
intended
to
be
added
to
the
list
of
heraldic
tinctures
but
are
noted
because
various
hatchings
have
been
invented
in
modern
times
to
represent
them
woodward
in
woodward
and
burnett
treatise
on
heraldry
alludes
to
various
tinctures
amongst
continental
arms
which
he
has
come
across
besides
the
metals
tinctures
and
furs
which
have
been
already
described
other
tinctures
are
occasionally
found
in
the
heraldry
of
continental
nations
but
are
comparatively
of
such
rarity
as
that
they
may
be
counted
among
the
curiosities
of
blazon
which
would
require
a
separate
volume
that
of
which
i
have
collected
instances
is
cendrée
or
ash
colour
which
is
borne
by
among
others
the
bavarian
family
of
ashua
as
its
parlantes
cendrée
a
mount
of
three
coupeaux
in
base
a
brown
colour
is
even
more
rare
as
a
tincture
of
the
field
the

argent
supporting
a
raven
rising
sable
and
holding
in
its
beak
a
horseshoe
proper
its
points
towards
the
or
du
appears
occasionally
apart
from
what
we
may
term
coats
that
it
differs
from
and
is
a
much
lighter
colour
than
azure
is
shown
by
the
following
example
the
florentine
cinti
now
cini
bear
a
coat
which
would
be
numbered
among
the
fausses
or
à
enquérir
per
pale
azure
and
an
estoile
or
is
the
field
of
a
coat
of
which
the
blazon
is
too
lengthy
for
insertion
in
this
place
which
was
granted
to
a
bohemian
knight
in
carnation
is
the
french
term
for
the
colour
of
naked
flesh
and
is
often
employed
in
the
blazonry
of
that
country
perhaps
mention
should
here
be
made
of
the
english
term
proper
anything
alive
or
otherwise
which
is
depicted
in
its
natural
colours
is
termed
proper
and
it
should
be
depicted
in
its
really
correct
tones
or
tints
without
any
attempt
to
assimilate
these
with
any
heraldic
tincture
it
will
not
be
found
in
the
very
ancient
coats
of
arms
and
its
use
is
not
to
be
encouraged
when
a
natural
animal
is
found
existing
in
various
colours
it
is
usual
to
so
describe
it
for
the
term
proper
alone
would
leave
uncertainty
for
instance
the
crest
of
the
lane
family
which
was
granted
to
commemorate
the
ride
of

charles

always
many
occasions

which
it
was
desired
to
represent
armorial
bearings
in
black
and
white
or
where
from
the
nature
of
the
handicraft
it
was
impossible
to
make
use
of
actual
colour
but
it
should
always
be
pointedly
remembered
that
unless
the
right
colours
of
the
arms
could
be
used
the
tinctures
were
entirely
ignored
in
all
matters
of
handicraft
until
the
seventeenth
century
various
schemes
of
hatchings
however
were
adopted
for
the
purpose
of
indicating
the
real
heraldic
colours
when
arms
were
represented
and
the
real
colours
could
not
be
employed
the
earliest
being
that
of
francquart
in
belgium
woodward
says
this
was
succeeded
by
the
systems
of
butkens
petra
sancta
lobkowitz
gelenius
and
de
rouck
but
all
these
systems
differed
from
each
other
and
were
for
a
time
the
cause
of
confusion
and
not
of
order
eventually
however
the
system
of
petra
sancta
the
author
of
superseded
all
the
others
and
has
remained
in
use
up
to
the
present
time
illustration
fig
upon
this
point
herr
ströhl
in
his
remarks
the
system
of
hatching
used
by
marcus
vulson
de
la
colombière
in
the
course
of
time
found
acceptance
everywhere
and
has
maintained
itself
in
use
unaltered
until
the
present
day
and
these
are
shown
in
fig
only
that
later
hatchings
have
been
invented
for
brown
grey
which
however
seems
rather
a
superfluous
enriching
none
of
these
later
creations
by
the
way
have
ever
been
used
in
this
country
for
the
sake
of
completeness
however
let
them
be
mentioned
see
fig
brown
orange
and
colour
of
nature
in
english
armory
tenné
is
represented
by
a
combination
of
horizontal
as
azure
lines
with
diagonal
lines
from
sinister
to
dexter
as
purpure
and
sanguine
or
murrey

a
combination
of
diagonal
lines

the
hatchings

themselves
to
the
angle
at
which
the
shield
is
placed
those
of
the
crest
to
the
angle
of
the

a
curious
difficulty
however
occurs
when
a
shield
as
is
so
often
the
case
in
this
country
forms
a
part
of
the
crest
such
a

the
tincture
lines
to
follow
the
angle
of
the
smaller
shield
in
the
crest
or
the
angle
of
the
helmet
opinion
is
by
no
means
agreed
upon
the
point
but
though
this
system
of
representing
colours
by
hatching
has
been
adopted
and
extensively
made
use
of
it
is
questionable
whether
it
has
ever
received
official
sanction
at
any
rate
in
great
britain
it
certainly
has
never
been
made
use
of
in
any
record
or
document
in
the
college

most
of
the
records
are
in

the
remainder
are
all
without

forms

or
for
or
a
ar
or
arg
for
argent
g
or
gu
for
gules
az
or
b
for

owing
to
the
likelihood
of
confusion
between
ar
and
az

being
almost
universally
used
in
old
trickings
for
azure
s
or
sa
for
sable
vt
for
vert
and
purp
for

it
is
unlikely
that
any
change
will
be
made
in
the
future
for
the
use
of
tincture
lines
is
now
very
rapidly
being
discarded
by
all
good
heraldic
artists
in
this
country
with
the
reversion
to
older
and
better
forms
and
methods
these
hatchings
become
an
anachronism
and
save
that
sable
is
represented
by
solid
black
they
will
probably
be
unused
and
forgotten
before
very
long
the
plain
simple
names
of
colours
such
as
red
and
green
seemed
so
unpoetical
and
unostentatious
to
the
heralds
and
poets
of
the
middle
ages
that
they
substituted
for
gold
topaz
for
silver
pearl
or
meergries
for
red
ruby
for
blue
sapphire
for
green
emerald
and
for
black
diamond
or

animal
whence
the
word
sable
let
the
following
blazonment
from
the

this
aberration
of
intellect
on
the
part
of
mediæval
heraldic
writers
for
it
really
amounted
to
little
more
had
very
little
if
indeed
it
had
any
english
official
recognition
no
one
dreams
of
using
such
blazon
at
the
present
time
and
it
might
have
been
entirely
disregarded
were
it
not
that
guillim
sanctions
its
use
and
he
being
the
high
priest
of
english
armory
to
so
many
his
example
has
given
the
system
a
certain
currency
i
am
not
myself
aware
of
any
instance
of
the
use
of
these
terms
in
an
english
patent
of
arms
the
furs
known
to

are
now
many
but
originally
they
were
only

every

viz

still
another

does
parker
in

of

namely
erminites
which
is
supposed
to
be
white
with
black
ermine
spots
and
a
red
hair
on
each
side
of
the
spot
i
believe
there
is
no
instance
known
of
any
such
fur
in
british
armory
it
is
not
mentioned
in
heraldic
atlas
nor
can
i
find
any
foreign
instance
so
that
who
invented
it
or
for
what
purpose
it
was
invented
i
can
not
say
and
i
think
it
should
be
relegated
with
abatements
and
the
of
jesus
christ
to
the
category
of
the
silly
inventions
of
former
heraldic
writers
not
of
former
heralds

i

official
act
which
has
recognised
the

german
term
for
erminois
is
but
there
are
no
distinctive
terms
either
in
french

be

always

sometimes
depicted
with

to
the
reality
of
the

inasmuch
as
the
spots
above
the
tail
to
which
we
are
now
accustomed
are
a
modern
variant
when
a
bend

ermine
the
spots
like
all
other
charges
placed
upon
a

be
bendwise

on

they
are

the
other
variety
of
fur
is
vair
this
originated
from
the
fur
of
a
kind
of
squirrel
the
ver
or
vair
differently
spelt
latin
which
was
much
used
for
the
lining
of
cloaks
the
animal
was
upon
the
back
and
white
underneath
and
the
whole
skin
was
used
it
will
be
readily
seen
that
by
sewing
a
number
of
these
skins
together
a
result
is
obtained
of
a
series
of
figures
alternating
and
white
and
this
is
well
shown
in
fig
which
shows
the
effigy
upon
the
tomb
of
geoffrey

count
of
anjou
where
the
lining

the

curious
error
which
is
pointed

upon

that
they
are
a
reference
to
the

some
would
derive
the
surname
woodward
however
states
that
a

horseshoes
were
assumed
as
by

descendants

whether

are
corruptions

whether
as
seems
infinitely
more
probable
they
are
merely
a
corrupted
form
of

the
verbal
blazon

nearly
always

in
the

there
is
a
difference
between

usage
in

the
white
panes
are
generally
and
one
thinks
more
correctly
represented
as
forming
the
first

upper

in

heraldry
the
reverse
is
more
usually
the
case
it
is
usual
to
depict
the
white
panes
of
ordinary
vair
with
white
rather
than
silver
though
the
use
of
the
latter
can
not
be
said
to
be
incorrect
there
being
precedents
in
favour
of
that
form
when
an
ordinary
is
of
vair
or
vairy
the
rows
of
vair
may
be
depicted
either
horizontally
or
following
the
direction
of
the
ordinary
there
are
accepted
precedents
for
both
methods
vair
is
always
blue
and
white
but
the
same
subdivision
of
the
field
is
frequently
found
in
other
colours
and
when
this
is
the
case
it
is
termed
vairy
of
such
and
such
colours
when
it
is
vairy
it
is
usually
of
a
colour
and
metal
as
in
the
case
of
ferrers
earls

do
i
know
of
any
rule
against
such
a
combination

it
will
be
time
enough
to
discuss
the
contingency
when

instance
comes
to

gerard

a
term

undoubtedly
has
an
accepted
place
in
british
armory
as
also
has
which
following
the
same
rules
as
results
in
a
field
as
fig
the
german
terms
for
potent
and
are
respectively
and
german
heraldry
has
evolved
yet
another
variant
of
potent
viz
displaced
as
in
fig
there
is
still
yet
another
german
heraldic
fur
which
is
quite
unknown
in
british
armory
this
is
called
otherwise
vair
bellies
and
is
usually
shown
to
be
hairy
and
represented
brown
possibly
this
is
the
same
as
the
to
which
woodward
refers
some
heraldic
writers
also
speak
of
as
meaning
the
pieces
of
which
the
vair
is
composed
they
also
use
the
terms
and
for
perhaps
from
the
drawings
in
some
instances
resembling
that
is
a
possible
meaning
of
it
may
be
said
that
all
these
variations
of
the
ancient
arise
from
mere
accident
generally
bad
drawing
supplemented
by
over
refinement
on
the
part
of
the
heraldic
writers
who
have
described
them
this
generalisation
may
be
extended
in
its
application
from
vair
to
many
other
heraldic
matters
to
all
intents
and
purposes
british
heraldry
now
or
hitherto
has
only
known
vair
and
potent
one
of
the
earliest
rules
one
learns
in
the
study
of
armory
is
that
colour
can
not
be
placed
upon
colour
nor
metal
upon
metal
now
this
is
a
definite
rule
which
must
practically
always
be
rigidly
observed
many
writers
have
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
only
case
of
an
infraction
of
this
rule
will
be
found
in
the
arms
of
jerusalem
argent
a
cross
potent
between
four
crosslets
or
this
was
a
favourite
windmill
at
which
the
late
woodward
tilted
vigorously
and
in
the
appendix
to
his
treatise
on
heraldry
he
enumerates
some
instances
of
the
violation
of
the
rule
the
whole
of
the
instances
he
quoted
however
are
taken
from
continental
armory
in
which
these
exceptions
for
even
on
the
continent
such
are
noticeable
exceptions
occur
much
more
frequently
than
in
this
country
nevertheless
such
exceptions
occur
in
british
armory
and
the
following
instances
of
coats
which
break
the
rule
may
be
quoted
the
arms
of
lloyd
of
cardigan
and
danyrallt
carmarthen
are
sable
a
spearhead
imbrued
proper
between
three
argent
on
a
chief
a
castle
of
the
second
burke
in
his
general
armory
says
this
coat
of
arms
was
granted
to
cadifor
ap
dyfnwal
ninth
in
descent
from
roderick
the
great
prince
of
wales
by
his
cousin
the
great
lord
rhys
for
taking
the
castle
of
cardigan
by
escalade
from
the
earl
of
clare
and
the
flemings
in
another
instance
is
a
coat
of
meredith
recorded
in
ulster
office
and
now
inherited
by
the
hon
richard
edmund
meredith
a
judge
of
the
supreme
court
of
judicature
of
ireland
and
a
judicial
commissioner
of
the
irish
land
commission
these
arms
are
gules
on
a
chevron
sable
between
three
goats
heads
erased
as
many
trefoils
or
an
instance
of
comparatively
recent
date
will
be
found
in
the
grant
of
the
arms
of
thackeray
a
little
careful
research
no
doubt
would
produce
a
large
number
of
english
instances
but
one
is
bound
to
admit
the
possibility
that
the
great
bulk
of
these
cases
may
really
be
instances
of
augmentation
furs
may
be
placed
upon
either
metal
or
colour
as
may
also
any
charge
which
is
termed
proper
german
heralds
describe
furs
and
natural
colours
as
amphibious
it
is
perfectly
legitimate
to
place
fur
upon
fur
and
though
not
often
found
numbers
of
examples
can
be
quoted
probably
one
will
suffice
the
arms
of
richardson
are
sable
two
hawks
belled
or
on
a
chief
indented
ermine
a
pale
ermines
and
three
lions
heads
counterchanged
it
is
also
correct
to
place
ermine
upon
argent
but
such
coats
are
not
very
frequently
found
and
it
is
usual
in
designing
a
coat
to
endeavour
to
arrange
that
the
fur
shall
be
treated
as
metal
or
colour
according
to
what
may
be
its
background
the
reason
for
this
is
obvious
it
is
correct
though
unusual
for
a
charge
which
is
blazoned
proper
and
yet
depicted
in
a
recognised
heraldic
colour
to
be
placed
upon
colour
and
where
such
cases
occur
care
should
be
taken
that
the
charges
are
blazoned
proper
a
charge
composed
of
more
than
one
tincture
that
is
of
a
metal
and
colour
may
be
placed
upon
a
field
of
either
for
example
the
coat
of
stewart
which
is
or
a
fess
chequy
azure
and
argent
other
examples
being
per
pale
ermine
and
azure
a
fess
wavy
gules
broadbent
and
azure
a
lion
rampant
argent
debruised
by
a
fess
per
pale
of
the
second
and
gules
walsh
but
in
such
coats
it
will
usually
be
found
that
the
first
tincture
of
the
composite
charge
should
be
in
opposition
to
the
field
upon
which
it
is
superimposed
for
instance
the
arms
of
stewart
are
or
a
fess
chequy
azure
and
argent
and
to
blazon
or
depict
them
with
a
fess
chequy
argent
and
azure
would
be
incorrect
when
an
ordinary
is
charged
upon
both
metal
and
colour
it
would
be
quite
correct
for
it
to
be
of
either
metal
colour
or
fur
and
in
such
cases
it
has
never
been
considered
either
exceptional
or
an
infraction
of
the
rule
that
colour
must
not
be
placed
upon
colour
nor
metal
upon
metal
there
is
one
point
however
which
is
one
of
these
little
points
one
has
to
learn
from
actual
experience
and
which
i
believe
has
never
yet
been
quoted
in
any
handbook
of
heraldry
and
that
is
that
this
rule
must
be
thrown
overboard
with
regard
to
crests
and
supporters
i
can
not
call
to
mind
an
instance
of
colour
upon
colour
but
a
gold
collar
around
the
neck
of
an
argent
crest
will
constantly
be
met
with
the
sinister
supporter
of
the
royal
achievement
is
a
case
in
point
and
this
rule
which
forbids
colour
upon
colour
and
metal
upon
metal
only
holds
with
regard
to
supporters
and
crests
when
the
crest
or
supporter
itself
is
treated
as
a
field
and
one
or
more
objects
the
royal
labels
as
already
stated
appear
to
be
a
standing
infraction
of
the
rule
if
white
and
argent
are
to
be
heraldically
treated
as
identical
the
rule
is
also
disregarded
entirely
as
regards
augmentations
and
scottish
cadency
bordures
so
long
as
the
field
is
party
that
is
divided
into
an
equal
number
of
pieces
for
example
paly
barruly
or
bendy
or
party
per
bend
or
per
chevron
it
may
be
composed
of
two
metals
or
two
colours
because
the
pieces
all
being
equal
and
of
equal
number
they
all
are
parts
of
the
field
lying
in
the
same
plane
none
being
charges
before
leaving
the
subject
of
the
field
one
must
not
omit
to
mention
certain
exceptions
which
hardly
fall
within
any
of
the
categories
one
of
these
can
only
be
described
by
the
word
landscape
it
is
not
uncommon
in
british
armory
though
i
know
of
but
one
instance
where
the
actual
field
itself
needs
to
be
so
described
this
is
the
coat
of
the
family
of
franco
the
paternal
ancestors
of
sir
massey
lopes
and
lord
ludlow
the
name
was
changed
from
franco
to
lopes
by
royal
licence
dated
the
of
may
whether
this
coat
of
arms
originated
in
an
english
grant
or
whether
the
english
grant
of
it
amounts
to
no
more
than
an
attempt
at
the
registration
of
a
previously
existing
or
greatly
similar
foreign
coat
of
arms
for
the
name
of
franco
i
am
unaware
but
the
coat
certainly
is
blazoned
in
a
landscape
field
a
fountain
therefrom
issuing
a
all
proper
but
landscape
has
very
extensively
been
made
use
of
in
the
augmentations
which
were
granted
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
and
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
centuries
in
these
cases
the
augmentation
very
generally
consisted
of
a
chief
and
thereon
a
representation
either
of
some
fort
or
ship
or
action
and
though
the
field
of
the
augmentation
is
officially
blazoned
argent
in
nearly
every
case
there
is
no
doubt
the
artist
was
permitted
and
perhaps
intended
to
depict
clouds
and
other
atmosphere
to
add
to
the
verisimilitude
of
the
picture
these
augmentations
will
be
more
especially
considered
in
a
later
chapter
but
here
one
may
perhaps
be
permitted
to
remark
that
execrable
as
we
now
consider
such
landscape
heraldry
it
ought
not
to
be
condemned
in
the
wholesale
manner
in
which
it
has
been
because
it
was
typical
of
the
over
elaboration
to
be
found
in
all
art
and
all
artistic
ideas
of
the
period
in
which
we
find
it
originating
heraldry
and
heraldic
art
have
always
been
a
mirror
of
the
artistic
ideas
prevalent
at
equivalent
periods
and
unless
heraldry
is
to
be
wholly
relegated
to
consideration
as
a
dead
subject
it
is
an
anachronism
to
depict
an
action
the
date
of
which
is
well
known
and
which
date
it
is
desired
to
advertise
and
not
conceal
in
a
method
of
art
belonging
to
a
different
period
in
family
arms
the
case
is
different
as
with
those
the
idea
apparently
is
always
the
concealment
of
the
date
of
nobility
the
landscape
variety
of
heraldry
is
more
common
in
germany
than
with
us
and
ströhl
writes
of
very
little
heraldic
worth
are
the
old
house
and
home
signs
as
they
were
used
by
landed
proprietors
tradesmen
and
artisans
or
workmen
as
indicative
of
their
possessions
wares
or
productions
these
signs
originally
simply
outline
pictures
were
later
introduced
into
heraldic
soil
inasmuch
as
bourgeois
families
raised
to
the
nobility
adopted
their
house
signs
as
heraldic
charges
upon
their
shields
there
are
also
many
coats
of
arms
which
run
in
base
a
representation
of
water
proper
and
one
of
the
best
instances
of
this
will
be
found
in
the
arms
of
oxford
though
for
the
sake
of
preserving
the
pun
the
coat
in
this
case
is
blazoned
argent
an
ox
gules
passing
over
a
ford
proper
similar
instances
occur
in
the
arms
of
renfrew
queensferry
leith
ryde
and
scores
of
other
towns
it
has
always
been
considered
permissible
to
represent
these
either
by
an
attempt
to
depict
natural
water
or
else
in
the
ancient
heraldic
way
of
representing
water
namely
barry
wavy
argent
and
azure
there
are
many
other
coats
of
arms
which
are
of
a
similar
character
though
specifically
blazoned
barry
wavy
argent
and
azure
now
this
representation
of
water
in
base
can
hardly
be
properly
said
to
be
a
charge
but
perhaps
it
might
be
dismissed
as
such
were
it
not
that
one
coat
of
arms
exists
in
scotland
the
whole
of
the
field
of
which
is
simply
a
representation
of
water
unfortunately
this
coat
of
arms
has
never
been
matriculated
in
lyon
register
or
received
official
sanction
but
there
is
no
doubt
of
its
ancient
usage
and
were
it
to
be
now
matriculated
in
conformity
with
the
act
of
there
is
very
little
doubt
that
the
ancient
characteristic
would
be
retained
the
arms
are
those
of
the
town
of
inveraray
in
argyllshire
and
the
blazon
of
the
coat
according
to
the
form
it
is
depicted
upon
the
corporate
seal
would
be
for
the

alone
has
evolved
separate
names
for

colours

other
nations
simply
using
the
term

are

the
term
semé
must
not
be
confused
with
diapering
for
whilst
the
objects
with
which
a
field
is
semé
are
an
integral
part
of
the
arms
diapering
is
a
purely
artistic
and
optional
matter
diapering
the
diapering
of
armorial
emblazonments
is
a
matter
with
which
the
of
armory
has
no
concern
diaper
never
forms
any
part
of
the
blazon
and
is
never
officially
noticed
being
considered
and
very
properly
allowed
to
remain
a
purely
artistic
detail
from
the
artistic
point
of
view
it
has
some
importance
as
in
many
of
the
earliest
instances
of
handicraft
in
which
armorial
decoration
appears
very
elaborate
diapering
is
introduced
the
frequency
with
which
diapering
is
met
with
in
armorial
handicraft
is
strangely
at
variance
with
its
absence
in
heraldic
paintings
of
the
same
periods
a
point
which
may
perhaps
be
urged
upon
the
attention
of
some
of
the
heraldic
artists
of
the
present
day
who
would
rather
seem
to
have
failed
to
grasp
the
true
purpose
and
origin
and
perhaps
also
the
use
of
diaper
in
stained
glass
and
enamel
work
where
the
use
of
diaper
is
most
frequently
met
with
it
was
introduced
for
the
express
purpose
of
catching
and
breaking
up
the
light
the
result
of
which
was
to
give
an
enormously
increased
effect
of
brilliance
to
the
large
and
otherwise
flat
surfaces
these
tricks
of
their
art
and
craft
the
old
handicraftsmen
were
past
masters
in
the
use
of
but
no
such
purpose
could
be
served
in
a
small
painting
upon
vellum
for
this
reason
early
heraldic
emblazonments
are
seldom
if
ever
found
to
have
been
diapered
with
the
rise
of
heraldic
engraving
amongst
the
little
masters
of
german
art
the
opportunity
left
to
their
hands
by
the
absence
of
colour
naturally
led
to
the
renewed
use
of
diaper
to
avoid
the
appearance
of
blanks
in
their
work
the
use
of
diaper
at
the
present
day
needs
to
be
the
result
of
careful
study
and
thought
and
its
haphazard
employment
is
not
recommended
if
as
woodward
states
an
assertion
one
is
rather
inclined
to
doubt
there
are
some
cases
abroad
in
which
the
constant
use
of
diapering
has
been
stereotyped
into
an
integral
part
of
the
arms
these
cases
must
be
exceedingly
few
in
number
and
they
certainly
have
no
counterpart
in
the
armory
of
this
country
where
for
artistic
reasons
diapering
is
employed
care
must
always
be
taken
that
the
decorative
form
employed
can
not
be
mistaken
for
a
field
either
charged
or
semé
partition
lines
if
there
is
one
subject
which
the
ordinary
of
armory
treat
in
the
manner
of
classification
adapted
to
an
essay
on
natural
history
or
grammar
with
its
attendant
rigidity
of
rule
it
is
the
subject
of
partition
lines
and
yet
the
whole
subject
is
more
in
the
nature
of
a
set
of
explanations
which
must
each
be
learned
on
its
own
merits
the
usual
lines
of
partition
are
themselves
well
enough
known
and
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
elaborate
the
different
variations
at
any
great
length
they
may
however
be
enumerated
as
follows
engrailed
embattled
indented
invecked
or
invected
wavy
or
undy
nebuly
dancetté
raguly
potenté
dovetailed
and
urdy
these
are
the
lines
which
are
recognised
by
most
modern
heraldic
and
generally
recapitulated
but
we
shall
have
occasion
later
to
refer
to
others
which
are
very
well
known
though
apparently
they
have
never
been
included
in
the
classification
of
partition
lines
fig
as
every
one
knows
is
formed
by
a
continuous
and
concurrent
series
of
small
semicircles
conjoined
each
to
each
the
sharp
points
formed
by
the
conjunction
of
the
two
arcs
being
placed
this
partition
line
may
be
employed
for
the
rectilinear
charges
known
as
ordinaries
or
in
the
bend
pale
pile
cross
chief
and
fess
when
these
are
described
as
engrailed
the
enclosing
lines
of
the
ordinary
other
than
the
edges
of
the
shield
are
all
composed
of
these
small
semicircles
with
the
points
turned
and
the
word
outwards
must
be
construed
as
pointing
away
from
the
centre
of
the
ordinary
when
it
is
depicted
in
the
case
of
a
chief
the
points
are
turned
downwards
but
it
is
rather
difficult
to
describe
the
use
of
the
term
when
used
as
a
partition
line
of
the
field
the
only
instance
i
can
call
to
mind
where
it
is
so
employed
is
the
case
of
baird
of
ury
the
arms
of
this
family
being
per
pale
engrailed
gules
and
or
a
boar
passant
counterchanged
in
this
instance
the
points
are
turned
towards
the
sinister
side
of
the
shield
which
would
seem
to
be
correct
as
there
being
no
ordinary
they
must
be
outwards
from
the
most
important
position
affected
which
in
this
case
undoubtedly
is
the
dexter
side
of
the
shield
in
the
same
way
per
fess
engrailed
would
be
presumably
depicted
with
the
points
outwards
from
the
chief
line
of
the
shield
that
is
they
would
point
downwards
and
i
should
imagine
that
in
per
bend
engrailed
the
points
of
the
semicircles
would
again
be
placed
inclined
towards
the
dexter
base
of
the
shield
but
i
may
be
wrong
in
these
two
latter
cases
for
they
are
only
supposition
this
point
however
which
puzzled
me
much
in
depicting
the
arms
of
baird
of
ury
i
could
find
explained
in
no
upon
the
subject
illustration
fig
lines
of
partition
the
term
or
is
the
precise
opposite
of
engrailed
it
is
similarly
composed
of
small
semicircles
but
the
points
are
turned
inwards
instead
of
outwards
so
that
it
is
no
more
than
the
exact
reverse
of
engrailed
and
all
the
regulations
concerning
the
one
need
to
be
observed
concerning
the
other
with
the
proviso
that
they
are
reversed
the
partition
line
has
certain
peculiarities
of
its
own
when
dividing
the
field
there
can
be
no
difficulty
about
it
inasmuch
as
the
crenellations
are
equally
inwards
and
outwards
from
any
point
and
it
should
be
noted
that
the
term
crenellé
is
almost
as
often
used
as
embattled
when
however
the
term
describes
an
ordinary
certain
points
have
to
be
borne
in
mind
the
fess
or
the
bar
embattled
is
drawn
with
the
crenellations
the
upper
only
the
under
edge
being
plain
unless
the
ordinary
is
described
both
as
embattled
and
similarly
a
chevron
is
only
crenellated
on
the
upper
edge
unless
it
is
described
as
both
embattled
and
but
a
pale
embattled
is
crenellated
on
both
edges
as
is
the
cross
or
saltire
strictly
speaking
a
bend
embattled
is
crenellated
upon
the
upper
edge
only
though
with
regard
to
this
ordinary
there
is
much
laxity
of
practice
i
have
never
come
across
a
pile
embattled
but
it
would
naturally
be
embattled
on
both
edges
some
writers
make
a
distinction
between
embattled
and
bretessed
giving
to
the
former
term
the
meaning
that
the
embattlements
on
the
one
side
are
opposed
to
the
indentations
on
the
other
and
using
the
term
bretessed
to
signify
that
embattlements
are
opposite
embattlements
and
indentations
opposite
indentations
i
am
doubtful
as
to
the
accuracy
of
this
distinction
because
the
french
term
bretessé
means
only
the
terms
and
need
to
be
considered
together
because
they
differ
very
little
and
only
in
the
fact
that
whilst
indented
may
be
drawn
with
any
number
of
teeth
dancetté
is
drawn
with
a
limited
number
which
is
usually
three
complete
teeth
in
the
width
of
the
field
but
it
should
be
observed
that
this
rule
is
not
so
hard
and
fast
that
the
necessity
of
artistic
depicting
may
not
modify
it
slightly
an
ordinary
which
is
indented
would
follow
much
the
same
rules
as
an
ordinary
which
was
engrailed
except
that
the
teeth
are
made
by
small
straight
lines
for
the
indentations
instead
of
by
small
semicircles
and
instances
can
doubtless
be
found
of
all
the
ordinaries
qualified
by
the
term
indented
dancetté
however
does
not
lend
itself
so
readily
to
general
application
and
is
usually
to
be
found
applied
to
either
a
fess
or
chief
or
occasionally
a
bend
in
the
case
of
a
fess
dancetté
the
indentations
on
the
top
and
bottom
lines
are
made
to
fit
into
each
other
so
that
instead
of
having
a
straight
band
with
the
edge
merely
toothed
one
gets
an
up
and
down
band
with
three
complete
teeth
at
the
top
and
three
complete
teeth
at
the
bottom
whilst
a
fess
a
bar
a
bend
and
a
chief
can
be
found
dancetté
i
do
not
see
how
it
would
be
possible
to
draw
a
saltire
or
a
cross
dancetté
at
any
rate
the
resulting
figure
would
be
most
ugly
and
would
appear
a
pile
and
a
chevron
seem
equally
impossible
though
there
does
not
seem
to
be
the
like
objection
to
a
pale
dancetté
an
instance
of
a
bend
dancetté
is
found
in
the
arms
of
cuffe
lord
desart
which
are
argent
on
a
bend
dancetté
sable
plain
cotised
azure
three
and
on
each
cotise
as
many
bezants
or
which
is
supposed
to
have
been
taken
from
water
and
which
is
supposed
to
be
derived
from
clouds
are
of
course
lines
which
are
well
known
they
are
equally
applicable
to
any
ordinary
and
to
any
partition
of
the
field
but
in
both
cases
it
should
be
noticed
by
artists
that
there
is
no
one
definite
or
accepted
method
of
depicting
these
lines
and
one
is
quite
at
liberty
and
might
be
recommended
to
widen
out
the
indentations
or
to
increase
them
in
height
as
the
artistic
requirements
of
the
work
in
hand
may
seem
to
render
advisable
it
is
only
by
bearing
this
in
mind
and
treating
these
lines
with
freedom
that
really
artistic
work
can
sometimes
be
produced
where
they
occur
there
is
no
fixed
rule
either
as
to
the
width
which
these
lines
may
occupy
or
as
to
the
number
of
indentations
as
compared
with
the
width
of
the
shield
and
it
is
a
pity
to
introduce
or
recognise
any
regulations
of
this
character
where
none
exist
there
are
writers
who
think
it
not
unlikely
that
vairé
and
barry
nebuly
were
one
and
the
same
thing
it
is
at
any
rate
difficult
in
some
old
representations
to
draw
any
noticeable
distinctions
between
the
methods
of
depicting
barry
nebuly
and
vair
the
line
has
been
the
subject
of
much
discussion
it
and
the
two
which
follow
viz
potenté
and
dovetailed
are
all
comparatively
modern
introductions
it
would
be
interesting
if
some
enthusiast
would
go
carefully
through
the
ancient
rolls
of
arms
and
find
the
earliest
occurrences
of
these
terms
my
own
impression
is
that
they
would
all
be
found
to
be
inventions
of
the
mediæval
writers
on
heraldry
raguly
is
the
same
as
embattled
with
the
crenellations
put
upon
the
slant
some
writers
say
they
should
slant
one
way
others
give
them
slanting
the
reverse
in
a
pale
or
a
bend
the
teeth
must
point
upwards
but
in
a
fess
i
should
hesitate
to
say
whether
it
were
more
correct
for
them
to
point
to
the
dexter
or
to
the
sinister
and
i
am
inclined
to
consider
that
either
is
perfectly
correct
at
any
rate
whilst
they
are
usually
drawn
inclined
to
the
dexter
in
woodward
and
burnett
they
are
to
the
sinister
and
guillim
gives
them
turned
to
the
dexter
saying
this
form
of
line
i
never
yet
met
with
in
use
as
a
partition
though
frequently
in
composing
of
ordinaries
referring
them
like
to
the
trunks
of
trees
with
the
branches
lopped
off
and
that
as
i
take
it
it
was
intended
to
represent
modern
heraldry
supplies
an
instance
which
in
the
days
of
guillim
of
course
did
not
exist
to
refer
to
this
instance
occurs
in
the
arms
of
the
late
lord
leighton
which
were
quarterly
per
fesse
raguly
or
and
gules
in
the
second
and
third
quarters
a
wyvern
of
the
first
it
is
curious
that
guillim
even
in
the
edition
of
does
not
mention
any
of
the
remaining
terms
dovetailed
in
modern
armory
is
even
yet
but
seldom
made
use
of
though
i
can
quote
two
instances
of
coats
of
arms
in
which
it
is
to
be
found
namely
the
arms
of
kirk
which
are
gules
a
chevron
dovetailed
ermine
on
a
chief
argent
three
dragons
heads
couped
of
the
field
and
ambrose
azure
two
lions
passant
in
pale
argent
on
a
chief
dovetailed
of
the
last
a
between
two
annulets
of
the
first
other
instances
of
dovetailed
used
as
a
line
of
partition
will
be
found
in
the
case
of
the
arms
of
farmer
which
are
per
chevron
dovetailed
gules
and
argent
in
chief
two
lions
heads
erased
of
the
last
and
in
base
a
salamander
in
flames
proper
and
in
the
arms
of
fenton
namely
per
pale
argent
and
sable
a
cross
dovetailed
in
the
first
and
fourth
quarters
a
and
in
the
second
and
third
a
trefoil
slipped
all
countercharged
there
are
of
course
many
others
the
term
as
will
be
seen
from
a
reference
to
fig
is
used
to
indicate
a
line
which
follows
the
form
of
the
division
lines
in
the
fur
potent
as
one
of
the
partition
lines
potenté
is
very
rare
as
to
the
term
which
is
given
in
woodward
and
burnett
and
also
in
berry
i
can
only
say
i
personally
have
never
come
across
an
instance
of
its
use
as
a
partition
line
a
cross
or
a
billet
urdy
one
knows
but
urdy
as
a
partition
line
i
have
yet
to
find
it
is
significant
that
it
is
omitted
in
parker
except
as
a
term
applicable
to
a
cross
and
the
instances
and
variations
given
by
berry
urdy
in
point
paleways
and
contrary
urdy
i
should
be
much
more
inclined
to
consider
as
variations
of
vair
and
though
it
is
always
well
to
settle
points
which
can
be
settled
i
think
urdy
and
its
use
as
a
partition
line
may
be
well
left
for
further
consideration
when
examples
of
it
come
to
hand
there
is
one
term
however
which
is
to
be
met
with
at
the
present
time
but
which
i
have
never
seen
quoted
in
any
under
the
heading
of
a
partition
line
that
is
flory
which
is
of
course
formed
by
a
succession
of
alternately
reversed
and
counterchanged
they
might
of
course
be
blazoned
after
the
quotation
of
the
field
as
per
bend
or
per
chevron
as
the
case
might
be
simply
as
so
many
counterchanged
and
alternately
reversed
in
a
specified
position
but
this
never
appears
to
be
the
case
and
consequently
the
would
appear
to
be
essentially
parts
of
the
field
and
not
charges
i
have
sometimes
thought
whether
it
would
not
be
more
correct
to
depict
per
something
flory
and
without
completing
the
simply
leaving
the
alternate
tops
of
the
to
show
in
the
cases
of
the
illustrations
which
have
come
under
my
notice
however
the
whole
is
depicted
and
as
an
instance
of
the
use
of
the
term
may
be
mentioned
the
arms
of
dumas
which
are
per
chevron
flory
and
or
and
azure
in
chief
two
lions
gambs
erased
and
in
base
a
garb
counterchanged
but
when
the
term
flory
and
is
used
in
conjunction
with
an
ordinary
a
fess
flory
and
the
only
alternately
reversed
are
represented
on
the
edges
of
the
ordinary
i
think
also
that
the
word
should
now
be
included
as
a
partition
line
i
confess
that
the
only
form
in
which
i
know
of
it
is
that
it
is
frequently
used
by
the
present
garter
king
of
arms
in
designing
coats
of
arms
with
chiefs
arched
recently
garter
has
granted
a
coat
with
a
chief
double
arched
but
if
a
chief
can
be
arched
i
see
no
reason
why
a
fesse
or
a
bar
can
not
equally
be
so
altered
and
in
that
case
it
undoubtedly
becomes
a
recognised
line
of
partition
perhaps
it
should
be
stated
that
a
chief
arched
is
a
chief
with
its
base
line
one
arc
of
a
large
circle
the
diameter
of
the
circle
and
the
consequent
acuteness
of
the
arch
do
not
appear
to
be
fixed
by
any
definite
rule
and
here
again
artistic
requirements
must
be
the
controlling
factor
in
any
decision
elvin
in
his
dictionary
of
heraldic
terms
gives
a
curious
assortment
of
lines
the
most
curious
of
all
perhaps
being
indented
embowed
or
hacked
and
hewed
where
such
a
term
originated
or
in
what
coat
of
arms
it
is
to
be
found
i
am
ignorant
but
the
appearance
is
exactly
what
would
be
presented
by
a
piece
of
wood
hacked
with
an
axe
at
regular
intervals
elvin
again
makes
a
difference
between
bretessed
and
making
the
embattlement
on
either
side
of
an
ordinary
identical
in
the
former
and
alternated
in
the
latter
he
also
makes
a
difference
between
raguly
which
is
the
conventional
form
universally
adopted
and
raguled
and
trunked
where
the
ordinary
takes
the
representation
of
the
trunk
of
a
tree
with
the
branches
lopped
but
these
and
many
others
that
he
gives
are
refinements
of
idea
which
personally
i
should
never
expect
to
find
in
actual
use
and
of
the
instances
of
which
i
am
unaware
i
think
however
the
term
which
is
found
in
both
the
arms
of
and
the
arms
of
colman
and
which
is
formed
by
the
addition
of
rays
to
the
ordinary
should
take
a
place
amongst
lines
of
partition
though
i
admit
i
know
of
no
instance
in
which
it
is
employed
to
divide
the
field
methods
of
partition
the
field
of
any
coat
of
arms
is
the
surface
colour
of
the
shield
and
is
supposed
to
include
the
area
within
the
limits
formed
by
its
outline
there
are
as
has
been
already
stated
but
few
coats
of
a
single
colour
minus
a
charge
to
be
found
in
british
heraldry
but
there
are
many
which
consist
of
a
field
divided
by
partition
lines
only
of
which
some
instances
were
given
on
page
a
shield
may
be
divided
by
partition
lines
running
in
the
direction
of
almost
any
ordinary
in
which
case
the
field
will
be
described
as
per

per
chevron

may
be

it

a

not

is

of
representing

chapter
viii
the
rules
of
blazon
the
word
blazon
is
used
with
some
number
of
meanings
but
practically
it
may
be
confined
to
the
verb
to
blazon
which
is
to
describe
in
words
a
given
coat
of
arms
and
the
noun
blazon
which
is
such
a
description
care
should
be
taken
to
differentiate
between
the
employment
of
the
term
blazon
and
the
verb
to
emblazon
which
latter
means
to
depict
in
colour
it
may
here
be
remarked
however
that
to
illustrate
by
the
use
of
outline
with
written
indications
of
colour
is
termed
to
trick
and
a
picture
of
arms
of
this
character
is
termed
a
trick
the
term
has
of
late
been
extended
though
one
almost
thinks
improperly
to
include
representations
of
arms
in
which
the
colours
are
indicated
by
the
specified
tincture
lines
which
have
been
already
referred
to
the
subject
of
blazon
has
of
late
acquired
rather
more
importance
than
has
hitherto
been
conceded
to
it
owing
to
an
unofficial
attempt
to
introduce
a
new
system
of
blazoning
under
the
guise
of
a
supposed
reversion
to
earlier
forms
of
description
this
it
is
not
but
even
if
it
were
what
it
claims
to
be
merely
the
revival
of
ancient
forms
and
methods
its
reintroduction
can
not
be
said
to
be
either
expedient
or
permissible
because
the
ancient
practice
does
not
permit
of
extension
to
the
limits
within
which
more
modern
armory
has
developed
and
modern
armory
though
less
ancient
is
armory
equally
with
the
more
ancient
and
simpler
examples
to
be
found
in
earlier
times
to
ignore
modern
armory
is
simply
futile
and
absurd
the
rules
to
be
employed
in
blazon
are
simple
and
comparatively
few
in
number
the
commencement
of
any
blazon
is
of
necessity
a
description
of
the
the
one
word
signifying
its
colour
being
employed
if
it
be
a
simple
field
or
if
it
be
composite
such
terms
as
are
necessary
thus
a
coat
divided
per
pale
or
per
chevron
is
so
described
and
whilst
the
scottish
field
of
this
character
is
officially
termed
parted
per
pale
or
per
chevron
the
english
equivalent
is
party
though
this
word
in
english
usage
is
more
often
omitted
than
not
in
the
blazon
which
commences
per
pale
or
per
chevron
as
the
case
may
be
the
description
of
the
different
colours
and
different
divisions
of
the
field
have
all
been
detailed
in
earlier
chapters
but
it
may
be
added
that
in
a
party
coloured
field
that
colour
or
tincture
is
mentioned
first
which
occupies
the
more
important
part
of
the
escutcheon
thus
in
a
field
per
bend
per
chevron
or
per
fess
the
upper
portion
of
the
field
is
first
referred
to
in
a
coat
per
pale
the
dexter
side
is
the
more
important
and
in
a
coat
quarterly
the
tinctures
of
the
and
quarters
are
given
precedence
of
the
tinctures
of
the
and
the
only
division
upon
which
there
has
seemed
any
uncertainty
is
the
curious
one
gyronny
but
the
correct
method
to
be
employed
in
this
case
can
very
easily
be
recognised
by
taking
the
first
quarter
of
the
field
and
therein
considering
the
field
as
if
it
were
simply
per
bend
after
the
field
has
been
described
anything
of
which
the
field
is
semé
must
next
be
alluded
to
gules
or
the
second
thing
to
be
mentioned
in
the
blazon
is
the
principal
charge
we
will
consider
first
those
cases
in
which
it
is
an
ordinary
thus
one
would
speak
of
or
a
chevron
gules
or
if
there
be
other
charges
as
well
as
the
ordinary
azure
a
bend
between
two
horses
heads
or
or
gules
a
chevron
between
three
roses
argent
the
colour
of
the
ordinary
is
not
mentioned
until
after
the
charge
if
it
be
the
same
as
the
latter
but
if
it
be
otherwise
it
must
of
course
be
specified
as
in
the
coat
or
a
fess
gules
between
three
crescents
sable
if
the
ordinary
is
charged
the
charges
thereupon
being
less
important
than
the
charges
in
the
field
are
mentioned
subsequently
as
in
the
coat
gules
on
a
bend
argent
between
two
fountains
proper
a
rose
gules
between
two
mullets
sable
the
position
of
the
charges
need
not
be
specified
when
they
would
naturally
fall
into
a
certain
position
with
regard
to
the
ordinaries
thus
a
chevron
between
three
figures
of
necessity
has
two
in
chief
and
one
in
base
a
bend
between
two
figures
of
necessity
has
one
above
and
one
below
a
fess
has
two
above
and
one
below
a
cross
between
four
has
one
in
each
angle
in
none
of
these
cases
is
it
necessary
to
state
the
position
if
however
those
positions
or
numbers
do
not
come
within
the
category
mentioned
care
must
be
taken
to
specify
what
the
coat
exactly
is
if
a
bend
is
accompanied
only
by
one
charge
the
position
of
this
charge
must
be
stated
for
example
gules
a
bend
or
in
chief
a
crescent
argent
a
chevron
with
four
figures
would
be
described
argent
a
chevron
between
three
escallops
in
chief
and
one
in
base
sable
though
it
would
be
equally
correct
to
say
argent
a
chevron
between
four
escallops
three
in
chief
and
one
in
base
sable
in
the
same
way
we
should
get
vert
on
a
cross
or
and
in
the
quarter
a
bezant
an
estoile
sable
though
to
avoid
confusion
this
coat
would
more
probably
be
blazoned
vert
a
cross
or
charged
with
an
estoile
sable
and
in
the
first
quarter
a
bezant
this
example
will
indicate
the
latitude
which
is
permissible
if
for
the
sake
of
avoiding
confusion
and
making
a
blazon
more
readily
understandable
some
deviation
from
the
strict
formulas
would
appear
to
be
desirable
if
there
be
no
ordinary
on
a
shield
the
charge
which
occupies
the
chief
position
is
mentioned
first
for
example
or
a
lion
rampant
sable
between
three
boars
heads
erased
gules
two
in
chief
and
one
in
base
many
people
however
would
omit
any
reference
to
the
position
of
the
heads
taking
it
for
granted
that
as
there
were
only
three
they
would
be
and
which
is
the
normal
position
of
three
charges
in
any
coat
of
arms
if
however
the
coat
of
arms
had
the
three
boars
heads
all
above
the
lion
it
would
then
be
necessary
to
blazon
it
or
a
lion
rampant
sable
in
chief
three
boars
heads
erased
gules
when
a
field
is
of
anything
this
is
taken
to
be
a
part
of
the
field
and
not
a
representation
of
a
number
of
charges
consequently
the
arms
of
long
are
blazoned
sable
semé
of
cross
crosslets
a
lion
rampant
argent
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
semé
of
cross
crosslets
is
always
termed
as
has
been
already
explained
when
charges
are
placed
around
the
shield
in
the
position
they
would
occupy
if
placed
upon
a
bordure
these
charges
are
said
to
be
in
orle
as
in
the
arms
of
hutchinson
quarterly
azure
and
gules
a
lion
rampant
erminois
within
four
cross
crosslets
argent
and
as
many
bezants
alternately
in
orle
though
it
is
equally
permissible
to
term
charges
in
such
a
position
an
orle
of
cross
crosslets
argent
and
bezants
alternately
or
so
many
charges
in
orle
see
fig
if
an
ordinary
be
engrailed
or
invected
this
fact
is
at
once
stated
the
term
occurring
before
the
colour
of
the
ordinary
thus
argent
on
a
chevron
nebuly
between
three
crescents
gules
as
many
roses
of
the
field
when
a
charge
upon
an
ordinary
is
the
same
colour
as
the
field
the
name
of
the
colour
is
not
repeated
but
those
charges
are
said
to
be
of
the
field
it
is
the
constant
endeavour
under
the
recognised
system
to
avoid
the
use
of
the
name
of
the
same
colour
a
second
time
in
the
blazon
thus
quarterly
gules
and
or
a
cross
counterchanged

in
the
first
quarter
a

the
first
barbed
and
seeded

the
third
in
the
third
quarter
a
azure
and
in
the
fourth
quarter
a
mullet
the
use
of
the
term
gold
being
alone
permissible
in
such
a
case
any
animal
which
needs
to
be
described
also
needs
its
position
to
be
specified
it
may
be
rampant
segreant
passant
statant
or
trippant
as
the
case
may
be
it
may
also
sometimes
be
necessary
to
specify
its
position
upon
the
shield
but
the
terms
peculiarly
appropriated
to
specific
animals
will
be
given
in
the
chapters
in
which
these
animals
are
dealt
with

and
the
bordure
an
ordinary
or
is
always
of
greater
importance
and
therefore
should
be
mentioned
before
any
other
charge
but
in
the
cases
alluded
to
the
remainder
of
the
shield
is
first
blazoned
before
attention
is
paid
to
these
figures
thus
we
should
get
argent
a
chevron
between
three
mullets
gules
on
a
chief
of
the
last
three
crescents
of
the

an
interesting
example
of
this
point
they

the
case
may
be
and
not
only
must
their
position
on
the
shield
as
regards
each
other
be
specified
but
their
individual
direction
must
also
be
noted

in
the
latter
case

the
lion
rampant
is
the
principal

and
the
bend
which
debruises
it
is
consequently
mentioned
afterwards
in
the
cases
of
a
cross
and
of
a

the
charges

are
alike
would
simply
be

the
term
cantonned
by
four
objects
is
sometimes
met
with

must
be
specified
as

certain
practical
hints
which
however
can
hardly
be
termed
rules
were
suggested
by
the
late
gough
nicholls
in
when
writing
in
the
and
and
subsequent
practice
has
since
conformed
therewith
though
it
may
be
pointed
out
with
advantage
that
these
suggestions
are
practically
and
to
all
intents
and
purposes
the
same
rules
which
have
been
observed
officially
over
a
long
period
amongst
these
suggestions
he
advises
that
the
blazoning
of
every
coat
or
quarter
should
begin
with
a
capital
letter
and
that
save
on
the
occurrence
of
proper
names
no
other
capitals
should
be
employed
he
also
suggests
that
punctuation
marks
should
be
avoided
as
much
as
possible
his
own
practice
being
to
limit
the
use
of
the
comma
to
its
occurrence
after
each
tincture
he
suggests
also
that
figures
should
be
omitted
in
all
cases
except
in
the
numbering
of
quarterings
when
one
or
more
quarterings
occur
each
is
treated
separately
on
its
own
merits
and
blazoned
entirely

other

sometimes
round
the
entire
escutcheon
causes
so
much
confusion
that
for
the
purposes
of
blazoning
it
is
essential
that
the
difference
between
quarters
and
grand
quarters
should
be
clearly
defined
in
order
to
simplify
the
blazoning
of
a
shield
and
so
express
the

of
the
charges

divided

which
those
placed
near

always
considered

important

heraldry

and

determined
not
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
onlooker
but
from
that
of
the
bearer

if
a
second
shield
be
placed
upon
the

this
is
called

in

the
the
enriching
of
the
shield
with
an
inescutcheon

into
lively
use
in
germany
in
the
course
of

as

between

and
the

shield
still
another
be
inserted
it
is
called

shield
from
its
position
but
except
in
anglicised
versions
of
continental
arms
these
distinctions
are
quite
foreign
to
british
armory
in
conclusion
it
may
be
stated
that
although
the
foregoing
are
the
rules
which
are
usually
observed
and
that
every
effort
should
be
made
to
avoid
unnecessary
tautology
and
to
make
the
blazon
as
brief
as
possible
it
is
by
no
manner
of
means
considered
officially
or
unofficially
that
any
one
of
these
rules
is
so
unchangeable
that
in
actual
practice
it
can
not
be
modified
if
it
should
seem
advisable
so
to
do
for
the
essential
necessity
of
accuracy
is
of
far
greater
importance
than
any
desire
to
be
brief
or
to
avoid
tautology
this
should
be
borne
in
mind
and
also
the
fact
that
in
official
practice
no
such
character
is
given
to
these
rules
as
one
is
led
to
believe
is
the
case
when
perusing
some
of
the
ordinary
of
armory
they
certainly
are
not
laws
they
are
hardly
rules
perhaps
being
better
described
as
accepted
methods
of
blazoning
chapter
ix
the
ordinaries
and
arms
and
the
charges
upon
arms
have
been
divided
into
many
fantastical
divisions
there
is
a
type
of
the
precise
mind
much
evident
in
the
scientific
writing
of
the
last
and
the
preceding
centuries
which
is
for
ever
unhappy
unless
it
can
be
dividing
the
object
of
its
consideration
into
classes
and
divisions
into
and
heraldry
has
suffered
in
this
way
for
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
the
rules
enunciated
are
impossible
as
rigid
guides
for
general
observance
and
that
they
never
have
been
complied
with
and
that
they
never
will
be
a
tabular
system
has
been
evolved
for
heraldry
as
for
most
other
sciences
the
precise
mind
has
applied
a
system
obviously
derived
from
natural
history
classification
to
the
principles
of
armory
it
has
selected
a
certain
number
of
charges
and
has
been
pleased
to
term
them
ordinaries
it
has
selected
others
which
it
has
been
pleased
to
term
the
selection
has
been
purely
arbitrary
at
the
pleasure
of
the
writer
and
few
writers
have
agreed
in
their
classifications
one
of
the
foremost
rules
which
former
heraldic
writers
have
laid
down
is
that
an
ordinary
must
contain
the
third
part
of
the
field
now
it
is
doubtful
whether
an
ordinary
has
ever
been
drawn
containing
the
third
part
of
the
field
by
rigid
measurement
except
in
the
solitary
instance
of
the
pale
when
it
is
drawn
per
fess
counterchanged
for
the
obvious
of
dividing
the
shield
into
six
equal
portions
a
practice
which
has
been
lately
pursued
very
extensively
owing
to
the
ease
with
which
by
its
adoption
a
new
coat
of
arms
can
be
designed
bearing
a
distinct
resemblance
to
one
formerly
in
use
without
infringing
the
rights
of
the
latter
certainly
if
the
ordinary
is
the
solitary
charge
upon
the
shield
it
will
be
drawn
about
that
specified
proportion
but
when
an
attempt
is
made
to
draw
the
walpole
coat
which
can
not
be
said
to
be
a
modern
one
so
that
it
shall
exhibit
three
ordinaries
to
wit
one
fess
and
two
chevrons
which
being
interpreted
as
of
the
shield
would
fill
it
entirely
and
yet
leave
a
goodly
proportion
of
the
field
still
visible
the
absurdity
is
apparent
and
a
very
large
proportion
of
the
classification
and
rules
which
occupy
such
a
large
proportion
of
the
space
in
the
majority
of
heraldic
are
equally
unnecessary
confusing
and
incorrect
and
what
is
very
much
more
important
such
rules
have
never
been
recognised
by
the
powers
that
have
had
the
control
of
armory
from
the
beginning
of
that
control
down
to
the
present
day
i
shall
not
be
surprised
to
find
that
many
of
my
critics
bearing
in
mind
how
strenuously
i
have
pleaded
elsewhere
for
a
right
and
proper
observance
of
the
laws
of
armory
may
think
that
the
foregoing
has
largely
the
nature
of
a
recantation
it
is
nothing
of
the
kind
and
i
advocate
as
strenuously
as
i
have
ever
done
the
compliance
with
and
the
observance
of
every
rule
which
can
be
shown
to
exist
but
this
is
no
argument
whatever
for
the
idle
invention
of
rules
which
never
have
existed
or
for
the
recognition
of
rules
which
have
no
other
origin
than
the
imagination
of
heraldic
writers
nor
is
it
an
argument
for
the
deduction
of
unnecessary
regulations
from
cases
which
can
be
shown
to
have
been
exceptions
too
little
recognition
is
paid
to
the
fact
that
in
armory
there
are
almost
as
many
rules
of
exception
as
original
rules
there
are
vastly
more
plain
exceptions
to
the
rules
which
should
govern
them
on
the
subject
of
ordinaries
i
can
not
see
wherein
lies
the
difference
between
a
bend
and
a
lion
rampant
save
their
difference
in
form
yet
the
one
is
said
to
be
an
ordinary
the
other
is
merely
a
charge
each
has
its
special
rules
to
be
observed
and
whilst
a
bend
can
be
engrailed
or
invected
a
lion
can
be
guardant
or
regardant
and
whilst
the
one
can
be
placed
between
two
objects
which
objects
will
occupy
a
specified
position
so
can
the
other
each
can
be
charged
and
each
furnishes
an
excellent
example
of
the
futility
of
some
of
the
ancient
rules
which
have
been
coined
concerning
them
the
ancient
rules
allow
of
but
one
lion
and
one
bend
upon
a
shield
requiring
that
two
bends
shall
become
bendlets
and
two
lions
lioncels
whereas
the
instance
we
have
already
quoted
the
coat
of
walpole
has
never
been
drawn
in
such
form
that
either
of
the
chevrons
could
have
been
considered
chevronels
and
it
is
rather
late
in
the
day
to
degrade
the
lions
of
england
into
unblooded
whelps
to
my
mind
the
ordinaries
and
are
no
more
than
first
charges
and
though
the
bend
the
fess
the
pale
the
pile
the
chevron
the
cross
and
the
saltire
will
always
be
found
described
as
honourable
ordinaries
whilst
the
chief
seems
also
to
be
pretty
universally
considered
as
one
of
the
honourable
ordinaries
such
hopeless
confusion
remains
as
to
the
others
scarcely
any
two
writers
giving
similar
classifications
that
the
utter
absurdity
of
the
necessity
for
any
classification
at
all
is
amply
demonstrated
classification
is
only
necessary
or
desirable
when
a
certain
set
of
rules
can
be
applied
identically
to
all
the
set
of
figures
in
that
particular
class
even
this
will
not
hold
with
the
ordinaries
which
have
been
quoted
a
pale
embattled
is
embattled
upon
both
its
edges
a
fess
embattled
is
embattled
only
upon
the
upper
edge
a
chief
is
embattled
necessarily
only
upon
the
lower
and
the
grave
difficulty
of
distinguishing
per
pale
engrailed
from
per
pale
invected
shows
that
no
rigid
rules
can
be
laid
down
when
we
come
to
the
confusion
is
still
more
apparent
for
as
far
as
i
can
see
the
only
reason
for
the
classification
is
the
tabulating
of
rules
concerning
the
lines
of
partition
the
bordure
and
the
orle
can
be
and
often
are
engrailed
or
embattled
the
fret
the
lozenge
the
fusil
the
mascle
the
rustre
the
flanche
the
roundel
the
billet
the
label
the
pairle
it
would
be
practically
impossible
to
meddle
with
and
all
these
figures
have
at
some
time
or
another
and
by
some
writer
or
other
been
included
amongst
either
the
ordinaries
or
the
in
fact
there
is
no
one
quality
which
these
charges
possess
in
common
which
is
not
equally
possessed
by
scores
of
other
charges
and
there
is
no
particular
reason
why
a
certain
set
should
be
selected
and
dignified
by
the
name
of
ordinaries
nor
are
there
any
rules
relating
to
ordinaries
which
require
the
selection
of
a
certain
number
of
figures
or
of
any
figures
to
be
controlled
by
those
rules
with
one
exception
the
exception
is
to
be
found
not
in
the
rules
governing
the
ordinaries
but
in
the
rules
of
blazon
after
the
field
has
been
specified
the
principal
charge
must
be
mentioned
first
and
no
charge
can
take
precedence
of
a
bend
fess
pale
pile
chevron
cross
or
saltire
except
one
of
themselves
if
there
be
any
reason
for
a
subdivision
those
charges
must
stand
by
themselves
and
might
be
termed
the
honourable
ordinaries
but
i
can
see
no
reason
for
treating
the

as

they

its
own
special
rules

in

with

of

as
are
in

with

to
the
origin
of
these
ordinaries
by
the
use
of
which
term
is
meant
for
the
moment
the
rectilinear
figures
peculiar
to
armory
it
may
be
worth
the
passing
mention
that
the
said
origin
is
a
matter
of
some
mystery
guillim
and
the
old
writers
almost
universally
take
them
to
be
derived
from
the
actual
military
scarf
or
a
representation
of
it
placed
across
the
shield
in
various
forms
other
writers
taking
the
surcoat
and
its
decoration
as
the
real
origin
of
coats
of
arms
derive
the
ordinaries
from
the
belt
scarf
and
other
articles
of
raiment
planché
on
the
other
hand
scouted
such
a
derivation
putting
forward
upon
very
good
and
plausible
grounds
the
simple
argument
that
the
origin
of
the
ordinaries
is
to
be
found
in
the
of
wood
placed
across
a
shield
for
strengthening
purposes
he
instances
cases
in
which
shields
apparently
charged
with
ordinaries
but
really
strengthened
with
can
be
taken
back
to
a
period
long
anterior
to
the
existence
of
regularised
armory
but
then
on
the
other
hand
shields
can
be
found
decorated
with
animals
at
an
equally
early
or
even
an
earlier
period
and
i
am
inclined
myself
to
push
planché
own
argument
even
farther
than
he
himself
took
it
and
assert
unequivocally
that
the
ordinaries
had
in
themselves
no
particular
symbolism
and
no
definable
origin
whatever
beyond
that
easy
method
of
making
some
pattern
upon
a
shield
which
was
to
be
gained
by
using
straight
lines
that
they
ever
had
any
military
meaning
i
can
not
see
the
slightest
foundation
to
believe
their
suggested
and
asserted
symbolism
i
totally
deny
but
when
we
can
find
as
planché
did
that
shields
were
strengthened
with
in
various
directions
it
is
quite
natural
to
suppose
that
these
afforded
a
ready
means
of
decoration
in
colour
and
this
would
lead
a
good
deal
of
other
decoration
to
follow
similar
forms
even
in
the
absence
of
upon
the
definite
shield
itself
the
one
curious
point
which
rather
seems
to
tell
against
theory
is
that
in
the
earliest
rolls
of
arms
but
a
comparatively
small
proportion
of
the
arms
are
found
to
consist
of
these
rectilinear
figures
and
if
the
ordinaries
really
originated
in
strengthening
one
would
have
expected
a
larger
number
of
such
coats
of
arms
to
be
found
but
at
the
same
time
such
arms
would
in
many
cases
in
themselves
be
so
palpably
mere
meaningless
decoration
of
upon
plain
shields
that
the
resulting
design
would
not
carry
with
it
such
a
compulsory
remembrance
as
would
a
design
for
example
derived
from
lines
which
had
plainly
had
no
connection
with
the
construction
of
the
shield
nor
could
it
have
any
such
basis
of
continuity
whilst
a
son
would
naturally
paint
a
lion
upon
his
shield
if
his
father
had
done
the
same
there
certainly
would
not
be
a
similar
inducement
for
a
son
to
follow
his
father
example
where
the
design
upon
a
shield
were
no
more
than
strengthening
pieces
because
if
these
were
gilt
for
example
the
son
would
naturally
be
no
more
inclined
to
perpetuate
a
particular
form
of
strengthening
for
his
shield
which
might
not
need
it
than
any
particular
artistic
division
with
which
it
was
involved
so
that
the
absence
of
arms
composed
of
ordinaries
from
the
early
rolls
of
arms
may
not
amount
to
so
very
much
still
further
it
may
well
be
concluded
that
the
compilers
of
early
rolls
of
arms
or
the
collectors
of
the
details
from
which
early
rolls
were
made
at
a
later
date
may
have
been
tempted
to
ignore
and
may
have
been
justified
in
discarding
from
their
lists
of
arms
those
patterns
and
designs
which
palpably
were
then
no
more
than
a
meaningless
colouring
of
the
strengthening
pieces
but
which
patterns
and
designs
by
subsequent
continuous
usage
and
perpetuation
became
accepted
later
by
certain
families
as
the
arms
their
ancestors
had
worn
it
is
easy
to
see
that
such
meaningless
patterns
would
have
less
chance
of
survival
by
continuity
of
usage
and
at
the
same
time
would
require
a
longer
continuity
of
usage
before
attaining
to
fixity
as
a
definite
design
the
undoubted
symbolism
of
the
cross
in
so
many
early
coats
of
arms
has
been
urged
strongly
by
those
who
argue
either
for
a
symbolism
for
all
these
rectilinear
figures
or
for
an
origin
in
articles
of
dress
but
the
figure
of
the
cross
preceded
christianity
and
organised
armory
and
it
had
an
obvious
decorative
value
which
existed
before
and
which
exists
now
outside
any
attribute
it
may
have
of
a
symbolical
nature
that
it
is
an
utterly
fallacious
argument
must
be
admitted
when
it
is
remembered
that
two
lines
at
right
angles
make
a
cross
probably
the
earliest
of
all
forms
of
decoration
and
that
the
cross
existed
before
its
symbolism
herein
it
differs
from
other
forms
of
decoration
the
masonic
emblems
which
can
not
be
traced
beyond
their
symbolical
existence
the
cross
like
the
other
heraldic
rectilinear
figures
came
into
existence
meaningless
as
a
decoration
for
a
shield
before
armory
as
such
existed
and
probably
before
christianity
began
then
being
in
existence
the
crusading
instinct
doubtless
caused
its
frequent
selection
with
an
added
symbolical
meaning
but
the
argument
can
truthfully
be
pushed
no
farther
the
bend
the
bend
is
a
broad
band
going
from
the
dexter
chief
corner
to
the
sinister
base
fig
according
to
the
old
theorists
this
should
contain
the
third
part
of
the
field
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
hardly
ever
does
and
seldom
did
even
in
the
oldest
examples
great
latitude
is
allowed
to
the
artist
on
this
point
in
accordance
with
whether
the
bend
be
plain
or
charged
and
more
particularly
according
to
the
charges
which
accompany
it
in
the
shield
and
their
disposition
thereupon
azure
a
bend
or
is
the
coat
concerning
which
the
historic
controversy
was
waged
between
scrope
and
grosvenor
as
every
one
knows
it

the

became
less

the
angle
it
enclosed
was
increased

now
as
then
it
is
perfectly
at
the
pleasure
of
the
artist
to
design
his

at
the
height

the
huge
preponderance
of
which
in
armory
we
of
course
owe
to
the
crusades
like
all

armorial
charges
has
strangely
developed
there
are
nearly
four
hundred
varieties
known
to
armory
or
rather
to
heraldic
and
doubtless
authenticated
examples
could
be
found
of
most
if
not
of
them
all

some
dozen
or
twenty
forms
are
about
as
many
as
will
be

regularly

constantly
occurring
some
but
not
all
of
the
varieties
of
the
cross
are
subject

the

when
the
heraldic
cross
was
first
assumed
with
any
reason
beyond
geometrical
convenience
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
was
intended
to
represent
the
sacred

itself
the
symbolism
of
the
cross
is
older
than
our
present
system
of
armory
but
the
cross
itself
is
more
ancient
than
its
symbolism
a
cross
depicted
upon
the
long
pointed
shields
of
those
who
fought
for
the

would

but
the
contemporary
shortening

together

naturally
to
the
arms
of
the
cross
being
so
disposed
that

of

curiously
enough
the

gives

it

in

as
in

it
is
even
nowadays
drawn
to
closely
approximate
to
its

it
may
be
remarked
here
perhaps
that
owing
to
the
fact
that
there
are
but
few
instances
in
which
the

the

have
been
used
as
the
sole

a
coat
of

in
which
these
are
employed
would
be
granted
with
fewer
of
the
modern
bedevilments
than
would
a
coat
with
a
chevron
for
example
i
know
of
no
instance
in
modern

in
which
a

when
figuring

to
the

and
even
though
a
charge
may
be
altogether
hidden
or
absconded
by
the
canton
the
charge
is
always
presumed
to
be
there
and
is
mentioned
in
the

both
a

sometimes
described

left

the

will
be
referred

it
may
be
here
stated
that

is
the

upon

this
latter
case
the
sinister
canton
is
used
to
signify
illegitimacy
this
will
be
more
fully
dealt
with
in
the
chapter
upon
marks
of
illegitimacy
a
curious
use
of
the
canton
for
the
purposes
of
marshalling
occurs
in
the
case
of
a
woman
who
being
an
heiress
herself
has
a
daughter
or
daughters
only
whilst
her
husband
has
sons
and
heirs
by
another
marriage
in
such
an
event
the
daughter
being
heir
or
in
the
case
of
daughters
these
being
coheirs
of
the
mother
but
not
heir
of
the
father
can
not
transmit
as
quarterings
the
arms
of
the
father
whom
she
does
not
represent
whilst
she
ought
to
transmit
the
arms
of
the
mother
whom
she
does
represent
the
husband
of
the
daughter
therefore
places
upon
an
escutcheon
of
pretence
the
arms
of
her
mother
with
those
of
her
father
on
a
canton
thereupon
the
children
of
the
marriage
quarter
this
combined
coat
the
arms
of
the
father
always
remaining
upon
a
canton
this
will
be
more
fully
dealt
with
under
the
subject
of
marshalling
the
canton
has
yet
another
use
as
a
mark
of
distinction
when
under
a
royal
licence
the
name
and
arms
of
a
family
are
assumed
where
there
is
no
blood
descent
from
the
family
the
arms
have
some
mark
of
distinction
added
this
is
usually
a
plain
canton
this
point
will
be
treated
more
fully
under
marks
of
cadency
woodward
mentions
three
instances
in
which
the
lower
edge
of
the
canton
is
indented
one
taken
from
the
calais
roll
viz
the
arms
of
sir
william
de
la
zouche
gules
bezantée
a
canton
indented
at
the
bottom
and
adds
that
the
canton
has
been
sometimes
thought
to
indicate
the
square
banner
of
a
and
he
suggests
that
the
lower
edge
being
indented
may
give
some
weight
to
the
idea
as
the
canton
does
not
appear
to
have
either
previously
or
subsequently
formed
any
part
of
the
arms
of
zouche
it
is
possible
that
in
this
instance
some
such
meaning
may
have
been
intended
but
it
can
have
no
such
application
generally
the

may
be
borne
upon
a

sinister
or
upon
an
inescutcheon
at
the
pleasure
of
the
wearer
there
is
some
little
authority
and
more
precedent
for
similarly
treating
the
badge
of
a
nova
scotian
baronet
but
as

the

appearing
as

upon

coat

certain
writers
state
that
it
is
termed
an
inescutcheon
if
only
one
appears
as
the
charge
but
that
when
more
than
one
is
present
they
are
merely
termed
escutcheons
this
is
an
unnecessary
refinement
not
officially
recognised
or
adhered
to
though
unconsciously
one
often
is
led
to
make
this
distinction
which
seems
to
spring
naturally
to
one
mind
when
one
inescutcheon
appears
it
is
sometimes
difficult
to
tell
whether
to
blazon
the
arms
as
charged
with
a
bordure
or
an
inescutcheon
some
coats
of
arms
for
example
the
arms
of
molesworth
will
always
remain
more
or
less
a
matter
of
uncertainty
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
bordure
should
not
be
wide
enough
to
fill
up
the
field
left
by
an
inescutcheon
nor
an
inescutcheon
large
enough
to
occupy
the
field
left
by
a
bordure
the
inescutcheon
in
german
armory
or
as
they
term
it
the
heart
escutcheon
when
superimposed
upon
other
quarterings
is
usually
the
paternal
or
most
important
coat
of
arms
the
same
method
of
marshalling
has
sometimes
been
adopted
in
scotland
and
the
arms
of
hay
are
an
instance
it
usually
in
british
heraldry
is
used
to
carry
the
arms
of
an
heiress
wife
but
both
these
points
will
be
dealt
with
later
under
the
subject
of
marshalling
the
inescutcheon
no
matter
what
its
position
should
never
be
termed
an
escutcheon
of
pretence
if
it
forms
a
charge
upon
the
original
arms
a
curious
instance
of
the
use
of
an
inescutcheon
will
be
found
in
the
arms
of
plate
when
an
inescutcheon
appears
on
a
shield
it
should
conform
in
its
outline
to
the
shape
of
the
shield
upon
which
it
is
placed
the
bordure
the
bordure
fig
occurs
both
as
a
charge
and
as
a
mark
of
difference
as
may
be
presumed
from
its
likeness
to
our
word
border
the
bordure
is
simply
a
border
round
the
shield
except
in
modern
grants
in
which
the
bordure
forms
a
part
of
the
original
design
of
the
arms
there
can
be
very
little
doubt
that
the
bordure
has
always
been
a
mark
of
difference
to
indicate
either
cadency
or
bastardy
but
its
stereotyped
continuance
without
further
alteration
in
so
many
coats
of
arms
in
which
it
originally
was
introduced
as
a
difference
and
also
its
appearance
in
new
grants
leave
one
no
alternative
but
to
treat
of
it
in
the
ordinary
way
as
a
charge
leaving
the
consideration
of
it
as
a
mark
of
difference
to
a
future
chapter
there
is
no
stereotyped
or
official
size
for
the
bordure
the
width
of
which
has
at
all
times
varied
though
it
will
almost
invariably
be
found
that
a
scottish
bordure
is
depicted
rather
wider
than
is
an
english
one
and
naturally
a
bordure
which
is
charged
is
a
little
wider
than
an
entirely
plain
one

the

granted
by

warrant
as
an
augmentation
to
queen
victoria
eugenie
of
spain
on
the
occasion

her
marriage
the
use
of
the
bordure
is
however
the
recognised
method
of
differencing
in
scotland
but
it
is
curious
that
with
the
scots
the
bordure
wavy
is
in
no
way
a
mark
of
illegitimacy
the
scottish
bordure
for
indicating
this
fact
is
the
bordure
compony
fig
which
has
been
used
occasionally
for
the
same
purpose
in
england
but
the
bordures
added
to
indicate
cadency
and
the
various
marks
to
indicate
illegitimacy
will
be
discussed
in
later
chapters
the
difference
should
here
be
observed
between
the
bordure
compony

means
illegitimacy
the
bordure
counter

which
may

a
certain
rule
regarding
the
bordure
is
the
sole
remaining
instance
in
modern
heraldry
of
the
formerly
recognised
practice
of
conjoining
two
coats
of
arms
which
it
might
be
necessary
to
marshal
together
by
dimidiation
instead
of
using
our
method
of
impalement
to
dimidiate
two
coats
of
arms
the
dexter
half
of
one
shield
was
conjoined
to
the
sinister
half
of
the
other
the
objections
to
such
a
practice
however
soon
made
themselves
apparent
a
dimidiated
chevron
was
scarcely
distinguishable
from
a
bend
and
the
dimidiation
of
arms
was
quickly
abandoned
in
favour
of
impalement
in
which
the
entire
designs
of
both
coats
of
arms
are
depicted
but
in
impaling
a
coat
of
arms
which
is
surrounded
by
a
bordure
the
bordure
is
not
continued
down
the
centre
between
the
two
coats
but
stops
short
top
and
bottom
at
the
palar
line
the
same
rule
by
the
way
applies
to
the
tressure
but
not
to
the
orle
the
curious
fact
however
remains
that
this
rule
as
to
the
dimidiation
of
the
bordure
in
cases
of
impalement
is
often
found
to
have
been
ignored
in
ancient
seals
and
other
examples
the
charges
upon
the
bordure
are
often
three
but
more
usually
eight
in
number
in
the
latter
case
being
arranged
three
along
the
top
of
the
shield
one
at
the
base
point
and
two
on
either
side
the
number
should
however
always
be
specified
unless
as
in
a
bordure
bezantée
it
is
immaterial
in
which
case
the
number
eight
must
be
in
emblazoning
the
shield
the
rule
as
to
colour
upon
colour
does
not
hold
and
seems
often
to
be
ignored
in
the
cases
of
bordures
noticeably
when
these
occur
as
marks
of
scottish
cadency
the
orle
the
orle
fig
or
as
it
was
originally
termed
in
ancient
british
rolls
of
arms
un
faux
ecusson
is
a
narrow
bordure
following
the
exact
outline
of
the
shield
but
within
it
showing
the
field
for
at
least
the
width
usually
occupied
by
a
bordure
between
the
outer
edge
of
the
orle
and
the
edge
of
the
escutcheon
an
orle
is
about
half
the
width
of
a
bordure
rather
less
than
more
but
the
proportion
is
never
very
exactly
maintained
the
difference
may
be
noted
between
this
figure
and
the
next

which

as
a
matter
of

usually
more

an

narrow

closely
together
the

it
is
however
usually
depicted
a
trifle
nearer
the
edge
of
the
escutcheon
than
the
orle
is
generally
placed
the
tressure
can
not
be
borne
singly
as
it
would
then
be
an
orle

plain
tressures
under
the
name
of
concentric
orles
will
be
found
mentioned
in
papworth
in
that
ordinary
eight
instances
are
given
of
arms
containing
more
than
a
single
orle
though
the
eight
instances
are
plainly
varieties
of
only
four
coats
two
concentric
orles
would
certainly
be
a
tressure
save
that
perhaps
they
would
be
drawn
of
rather
too
great
a
width
for
the
term
tressure
to
be
properly
applied
to
them

tressure

and
if
these
instances
be
disregarded
and
i
am
inclined
to
doubt
them
as
genuine
coats
there
certainly
is
no
example
of
a
plain
tressure
in
british
heraldry
and
one
attention
must
be
directed
to
the
tressure
flory
and
counterflory
fig
so
general
in
scottish
heraldry
originating
entirely
in
the
royal
escutcheon
one
can
not
do
better
than
reproduce
the
remarks
of
lyon
king
of
arms
upon
the
subject
from
his
work
heraldry
in
relation
to
scottish
history
and
art
william
the
lion
has
popularly
got
the
credit
of
being
the
first
to
introduce
heraldic
bearings
into
scotland
and
to
have
assumed
the
lion
as
his
personal
cognisance
the
latter
statement
may
or
may
not
be
true
but
we
have
no
trace
of
hereditary
arms
in
scotland
so
early
as
his
reign
certainly
the
lion
does
not
appear
on
his
seal
but
it
does
on
that
of
his
son
and
successor
alexander
with
apparent
remains
of
the
double
tressure
flory
counterflory
a
device
which
is
clearly
seen
on
the
seals
of
alexander
iii
we
are
unable
to
say
what
the
reason
was
for
the
adoption
of
such
a
distinctive
coat
of
course
if
you
turn
to
the
older
writers
you
will
find
all
sorts
of
fables
on
the
subject
even
the
sober
and
sensible
nisbet
states
that
lion
has
been
carried
on
the
armorial
ensign
of
scotland
since
the
first
founding
of
the
monarchy
by
king
fergus
i
a
very
mythical
personage
who
is
said
to
have
flourished
about
though
he
is
careful
to
say
that
he
does
not
believe
arms
are
as
old
as
that
period
he
says
however
that
it
is
doubt
that
charlemagne
entered
into
an
alliance
with
achaius
king
of
scotland
and
for
the
services
of
the
scots
the
french
king
added
to
the
scottish
lion
the
double
tressure
to
show
that
the
former
had
defended
the
french
lilies
and
that
therefore
the
latter
would
surround
the
lion
and
be
a
defence
to
him
all
this
is
very
pretty
but
it
is
not
history
chalmers
remarks
in
his
caledonia
that
the
lion
may
possibly
have
been
derived
from
the
arms
of
the
old
earls
of
northumberland
and
huntingdon
from
whom
some
of
the
scottish
kings
were
descended
and
he
mentions
an
old
roll
of
arms
preserved
by
leland
which
is
certainly
not
later
than
in
which
the
arms
of
scotland
are
blazoned
as
a
lion
gules
within
a
bordure
or
fleuretté
which
we
may
reasonably
interpret
as
an
early
indication
of
what
may
be
considered
as
a
foreign
rendering
of
the
double
tressure
sylvanus
morgan
one
of
the
very
maddest
of
the
heraldic
writers
says
that
the
tressure
was
added
to
the
shield
of
scotland
in
testimony
of
a
league
between
scotland
and
france
by
charles
but
that
king
did
not
ascend
the
throne
of
france
till
at
which
time
we
have
clear
proof
that
the
tressure
was
a
firmly
established
part
of
the
scottish
arms
one
of
the
earliest
instances
of
anything
approaching
the
tressure
in
the
scottish
arms
which
i
have
met
with
is
in
an
armorial
of
matthew
paris
which
is
now
in
the
cottonian
mss
in
the
british
museum
and
at
one
time
belonged
to
alban
monastery
here
the
arms
of
the
king
of
scotland
are
given
as
or
a
lion
rampant
flory
gules
in
a
bordure
of
the
same
the
drawing
represents
a
lion
within
a
bordure
the
latter
being
pierced
by
ten
their
heads
all
looking
inwards
the
other
end
not
being
free
but
attached
to
the
inner
margin
of
the
shield
this
you
will
observe
is
very
like
the
arms
i
mentioned
as
described
by
chalmers
and
it
may
possibly
be
the
same
volume
which
may
have
been
acquired
by
sir
robert
cotton
in
there
was
a
curious
attempt
of
the
scottish
parliament
to
displace
the
tressure
an
act
was
passed
in
that
year
for
some
hitherto
unexplained
reason
by
which
it
was
ordained
that
in
tyme
to
cum
thar
suld
be
na
double
tresor
about
his
the
king
armys
but
that
he
suld
ber
hale
armys
of
the
lyoun
without
ony
mair
seeing
that
at
the
time
of
this
enactment
the
scottish
kings
had
borne
the
tressure
for
upwards
of
years
it
is
difficult
to
understand
the
cause
of
this
procedure
like
many
other
acts
however
it
never
seems
to
have
been
carried
into
effect
at
least
i
am
not
aware
of
even
a
solitary
instance
of
the
scottish
arms
without
the
tressure
either
at
or
after
this
period
there
are
other
two
representations
of
the
scottish
arms
in
foreign
armorials
to
which
i
may
briefly
allude
one
is
in
the
de
a
beautiful
in
the
royal
library
at
brussels
the
scottish
shields
in
which
have
been
figured
by
stodart
in
his
book
on
scottish
arms
and
more
accurately
by
sir
archibald
dunbar
in
a
paper
read
to
the
society
of
antiquaries
of
scotland
in
the
armorial
is
believed
to
be
the
work
of
claes
heynen
gelre
herald
to
the
duke
of
gueldres
between
and
with
later
additions
by
another
hand
the
coat
assigned
in
it
to
the
king
of
scotland
is
the
lion
and
double
tressure
the
lion
is
uncrowned
and
is
armed
and
langued
azure
above
the
shield
is
a
helmet
argent
adorned
behind
with
a
short
capelin
or
plain
mantling
on
which
is
emblazoned
the
saltire
and
chief
of
the
bruces
from
which
we
may
gather
that
the
arms
of
david
ii
are
here
represented
the
lining
is
blue
which
is
unusual
as
mantlings
are
usually
lined
or
doubled
with
a
metal
if
not
with
ermine
the
helmet
is
surmounted
by
an
imperial
crown
with
a
dark
green
bonnet
spotted
with
red
on
the
crown
there
is
the
crest
of
a
lion
sejant
guardant
gules
imperially
crowned
or
holding
in
his
paw
a
sword
upright
the
tail
is
coué
or
placed
between
the
of
the
lion
but
it
then
rises
up
and
flourishes
high
above
his
back
in
a
sufficiently
defiant
fashion
this
shows
that
the
scottish
arms
were
well
known
on
the
continent
of
europe
nearly
a
hundred
years
before
the
date
of
the
grunenberg
while
virgil
de
solis
gives
a
sufficiently
accurate
representation
of
the
royal
shield
though
the
all
project
outwards
as
in
the
case
of
grunenberg
he
gives
the
crest
as
a
lion
rampant
holding
a
sword
in
bend
over
his
shoulder
another
ancient
representation
of
the
scottish
arms
occurs
in
a
treatise
on
heraldry
of
the
sixteenth
century
containing
the
coats
of
some
foreign
sovereigns
and
other
personages
bound
up
with
a
scottish
armorial
probably
by
david
lindsay
lyon
in
the
tressure
like
the
bordure
in
the
case
of
an
impalement
stops
at
the
line
of
impalement
as
will
be
seen
by
a
reference
to
the
arms
of
queen
anne
after
the
union
of
the
crowns
of
england
and
scotland
it
is
now
held
both
in
england
and
scotland
that
the
tressure
flory
and
counterflory
is
as
a
part
of
the
royal
arms
protected
and
can
not
be
granted
to
any
person
without
the
express
licence
of
the
sovereign
this
however
does
not
interfere
with
the
matriculation
or
exemplification
of
it
in
the
case
of
existing
arms
in
which
it
occurs
many
scottish
families
bear
or
claim
to
bear
the
royal
tressure
by
reason
of
female
descent
from
the
royal
house
but
it
would
seem
much
more
probable
that
in
most
if
not
in
all
cases
where
it
is
so
borne
by
right
its
origin
is
due
rather
to
a
gift
by
way
of
augmentation
than
to
any
supposed
right
of
inheritance
the
apparently
conflicting
statements
of
origin
are
not
really
antagonistic
inasmuch
as
it
will
be
seen
from
many
analogous
english
instances
mowbray
manners
and
seymour
that
near
relationship
is
often
the
only
reason
to
account
for
the
grant
of
a
royal
augmentation
as
an
ordinary
augmentation
of
honour
it
has
been
frequently
granted
the
towns
of
aberdeen
and
perth
obtained
early
the
right
of
honouring
their
arms
with
the
addition
of
the
royal
tressure

appears
on
the
still
existing
matrix
of
the
burgh
seal
of
aberdeen

was
engraved
in
james

a
warrant
to
lyon

surround

arms

his

services

refused

in

that

no
more
than
distinctively
heraldic
charges

is

original
form
is
the

shape

in

this

upon
this
point

should
be
made
to

chapters

an
indefinite
number
of
lozenges
conjoined
as

are
known
as
a

a

and
less
width

a
lozenge

an
altogether
narrower
figure

though
this
distinction
is
generally
observed
it
is
not
always
easy
to
decide
which
figure
any
emblazonment
is
intended
to
represent

the
blazon

in
many
cases
the
variations
of
different
coats
of
arms
to
suit
or
to
fit
the
varying
shapes
of
shields
have
resulted
in
the
use
of
lozenges

fusils

william

five

this

quite
possible

the
difference

that
in

the

no

derived
from
earlier
coats
of
arms
the

of

was
covered
by
an
interlacing
of
alternate
bendlets
and
bendlets
sinister
because
many
of
the
families
who
now
bear
a
simple
fret
are
found
in
earlier
representations

in
the
early
rolls
of

were

so
many
other
families
which

now
find

their

undoubtedly
fretty
they
appear

in

the
seal
of
john

earl
of

roughly
marks
the
period
and
shows
the
source
of
the
confusion
fig
but
it
should
be
noted
that
sir
richard
arundel
lord
maltravers
bore
at
the
siege
of
rouen
in
the
year
gules
a
lion
rampant
or
quarterly
with
sable
a
fret
or
for
maltravers
this
would
seem
to
indicate
that
those
who
treat
the
fret
and
fretty
as
interchangeable
have
good
grounds
for
so
doing
a
sir
john
maltravers
bore
sable
fretty
or
at
the
siege
of
calais
and
another
sir
john
maltravers
a
knight
banneret
bore
at
the
first
dunstable
tournament
sable
fretty
or
a
label
of
three
points
argent
as
he
is
there
described
as
le
fitz
the
label
was
probably
a
purely
temporary
mark
of
difference
in
a
roll
of
arms
which
is
believed
to
belong
to
the
latter
part
of
the
reign
of
henry
a
sir
william
maltravers
is
credited
with
sable
fretty
or
on

quarter

three
lions

in
pale
gules
the
palpable
origin
of
the
fret
or
fretty
in
the
case
of
the
arms
of
maltravers
is
simply
the
canting
similarity
between
a
traverse
and
the
name
maltravers
another
case
which
starting
fretty
has
ended
in
a
fret
occurs
in
the
arms
of
the
family
of
harington
sir
john
de
haverington
or
sir
john
de
harington
is
found
at
the
first
dunstable
tournament
in
bearing
sable
fretty
argent
and
this
coat
of
arms
variously
differenced
appears
in
some
number
of
the
other
early
rolls
of
arms
the
harington
family
as
may
be
seen
from
the
current
baronetages
now
bear
sable
a
fret
argent
but
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
in
this
case
the
origin
of
the
fretty
is
to
be
found
in
a
representation
of
a

usually
depicted
when
borne
singly

composed
of
a
bendlet

be

couped

it
is

as
a
rule

the

he

give
upon
the
same
a
surcoat

unless
you
do
well
mark
such
coat
you
may
take
it
for
a
coat

the
surcoat
is
much
the
same
figure
that
would
remain
after
flaunches
had
been
taken
from
the

a

this
exception
that
the
flaunches
would
be
wider

the
intervening

necessarily
much
narrower

this
is
supposed
to
be
one

however

explanation
exists

blazon

them
is
sable
a
bend
or
between
six
fountains
proper
concerning
this
coat
of
arms
aubrey
says
i
believe
anciently
was
only
sable
a
bend
or
with
all
deference
to
aubrey
i
personally
neither
think
he
was
right
nor
do
i
pay
much
attention
to
his
particularly
in
this
case
inasmuch
as
every
known
record
of
the
stourton
arms
introduces
the
six
fountains
the
name
stourton
originally
de
stourton
is
emphatically
a
territorial
name
and
there
is
little
opportunity
for
this
being
gainsaid
inasmuch
as
the
lordship
and
manor
of
stourton
in
the
counties
of
wilts
and
somerset
remained
in
the
possession
of
the
lords
stourton
until
the
year
the
present
lord
mowbray
and
stourton
still
owns
land
within
the
parish
consequently
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
the
lords
stourton
derived
their
surname
from
this
manor
of
stourton
equally
is
it
certain
that
the
manor
of
stourton
obtained
its
name
from
the
river
stour
which
rises
within
the
manor
the
sources
of
the
river
stour
are
six
wells
which
exist
in
a
tiny
valley
in
stourton
park
which
to
this
day
is
known
by
the
name
of
the
six
wells
bottom
in
the
present
year
of
grace
only
one
of
the
six
wells
remains
visible
when
sir
richard
colt
hoare
wrote
there
were
four
visible
of
these
four
three
were
outside
and
one
inside
the
park
wall
the
other
two
within
the
park
had
been
then
closed

when
leland
wrote
in

six

were
in
existence

visible

he
wrote

says
the
same
thing
these
six
fountains
are
borne
in
signification
of
six
springs
whereof
the
river
of
sture
in
wiltshire
hath
his
beginning
and
passeth
along
to
sturton
the
seat
of
that
barony
here
then
is
the
origin
of
the
six
fountains
upon
the
coat
of
arms
but
aubrey
remarks
that
three
of
the
six
springs
in
the
park
are
in
the
county
of
wilts
whereas
camden
has
put
them
all
in
somersetshire
however
the
fact
is
that
three
of
the
springs
were
inside
the
park
and
three
outside
and
that
three
were
in
wiltshire
and
three
in
somersetshire
here
then
is
to
be
found
the
division
upon
the
coat
of
arms
of
the
six
fountains
in
the
two
sets
of
three
each
and
it
is
by
no
means
an
improbable
suggestion
that
the
bend
which
separates
the
three
from
the
three
is
typical
of
or
was
suggested
by
either
the
park
wall
or
pale
or
by
the
line
of
division
between
the
two
counties
and
the
more
probable
of
the
two
seems
to
be
the
park
wall
the
coat
of
arms
is
just
a
map
of
the
property
now
with
regard
to
the
arms
as
far
as
is
known
there
has
not
been
at
any
time
the
slightest
deviation
by
the
family
of
the
lords
stourton
from
the
coat
quoted
and
illustrated
but
before
leaving
the
subject
it
may
be
well
to
point
out
that
in
the
few
cases
in
which
an
ancient
coat
of
arms
carries
with
it
an
explanation
such
explanation
is
usually
to
be
found
either
in
some
such
manner
as
that
in
which
these
arms
of
stourton
have
been
explained
or
else
in
some
palpable
pun
and
not
in
the
mythical
accounts
and
legends
of
supernatural
occurrences
which
have
been
handed
down
and
seldom
indeed
in
any
explanation
of
personal

there
can
be
very
little

that
this

an

one
can
see
no

the

a

why
the

have
been
included

the

excluded
when
the
annulet
is
of
quite
as
frequent

it

its

implies
simply
a

will
be

there
is
no
doubt
that
in
those
cases
in
which
it
now
exists
as

the
origin
must
be
traced
to
its
earlier
use

further

not

the

my
comprehension
it
is
not
of
frequent
occurrence
and
i
have
yet
to
ascertain
in
which
form
it
has
acquired
this
status
the
chaplet
which
is
usually
meant
when
the
term
is
employed
is
the
garland

laurel

other

which
is
found
more
frequently
as
part
of
a

is
also
the
chaplet

it
is
difficult
to
describe
save
as
a
large
broad
annulet

as
the
one
which
figures
in
the
arms
of

fig

which
is
charged
at
four
regular
intervals
with
roses
mullets
or
some
other
objects
the
chaplet
of
oak
and
acorns
is
sometimes
known
as
a
civic
crown
but
the
term
chaplet
will
more
frequently
be
found
giving
place
to
the
use
of
the
word
wreath
and
a
chaplet
of
laurel
or
roses
unless
completely
conjoined
and
figuring
as
a
charge
upon
the
shield
will
be
far
more
likely
to
be
termed
a
wreath
or
garland
of
laurel
or
roses
than
a
chaplet
there
are
many
other
charges
which
have
no
great
distinction
from
some
of
these
which
have
been
enumerated
but
as
nobody
hitherto
has
classed
them
as
ordinaries
i
suppose
there
could
be
no
excuse
for
so
introducing
them
but
the
division
of
any
heraldic
charges
into
ordinaries
and
and
their
separation
from
other
figures
seems
to
a
certain
extent
incomprehensible
and
very
unnecessary
chapter
x
the
human
figure
in
heraldry
if
we
include
the
many
instances
of
the
human
head
and
the
human
figure
which
exist
as
crests
and
also
the
human
figure
as
a
supporter
probably
it
or
its
parts
will
be
nearly
as
frequently
met
with
in
armory
as
the
lion
but
if
crests
and
supporters
be
disregarded
and
the
human
figure
be
simply
considered
as
a
charge
upon
the
shield
it
is
by
no
means
often
to
be
met
with
english
but
not
scottish
official
heraldry
now
and
for
a
long
time
past
has
set
its
face
against
the
representation
of
any
specific
saint
or
other
person
in
armorial
bearings
in
many
cases
however
particularly
in
the
arms
of
ecclesiastical
sees
and
towns
the
armorial
bearings
registered
are
simply
the
conventionalised
heraldic
representation
of
seal
designs
dating
from
a
very
much
earlier
period
seal
engravers
laboured
under
no
such
limitations
and
their
representations
were
usually
of
some
specific
saint
or
person
readily
recognisable
from
accompanying
objects
consequently
if
it
be
desirable
the
identity
of
a
figure
in
a
coat
of
arms
can
often
be
traced
in
such
cases
by
reference
to
a
seal
of
early
date
whilst
all
the
time
the
official
coat
of
arms
goes
no
further
than
to
term
the
figure
that
of
a
saint
the
only
representation
which
will
be
found
in
british
heraldry
of
the
deity
is
in
the
arms
of
the
see
of
chichester
which
certainly
originally
represented
our
lord
seated
in
glory
whether
by
intention
or
carelessness

however

now

his
head
and
in
his
mouth
a
sword
proper
possibly
it
is
a
corruption
but
i
am
rather
inclined
to
think
it
is
an
intentional
alteration
to
avoid
the
necessity
of
any
attempt
to
pictorially
represent
the
deity

a

disposed

proper
this
curious
coat
of
arms
has
been
the
subject
of
much
speculation
the
fact
that
in
some
early
examples
the
body
is
swinging
from
a
gibbet
has
led
some
to
suppose
the
arms
to
be
an
allusion
to
the
fact
or
legend
that
one
of
the
family
recovered
the
body
of
kenneth
who
had
suffered
death
by
hanging
at
the
hands
of
the
picts
but
it
seems
more
likely
that
if
the
gibbet
is
found
in
any
authoritative
versions
of
the
arms
possibly
the
coat
may
owe
its
origin
to
a
similar
reason
to
that
which
is
said
and
probably
correctly
to
account
for
the
curious
crest
of
the
davenport
family
viz
a
man
head
in
profile
couped
at
the
shoulders
proper
about
the
neck
a
rope
or
or
as
it
is
sometimes
termed
a
felon
head
proper
about
the
neck
a
halter
or
there
is
now
in
the
possession
of
the
capesthorne
branch
of
the
davenport
family
a
long
and
very
ancient
roll
containing
the
names
of
the
master
robbers
captured
and
beheaded
in
the
times
of
koran
roger
and
thomas
de
davenport
and
probably
the
davenport
family
held
some
office
or
royal
commission
which
empowered
them
to
deal
in
a
summary
way
with
the
outlaws
which
infested
the
peak
country
it
is
more
than
probable
that
the
crest
of
davenport
should
be
traced
to
some
such
source
as
this
and
i
suggest
the
possibility
of
a
similar
origin
for
the
arms
of
dalziel
as
a
crest
the
savage
and
are
constantly
occurring

are
in

distinguished
by
the
garlands
of

both
loins

sometimes

be
found
in

form
of
supporters

occasionally
as
crests
but
it
is
difficult
to
classify
them
and
it
must
suffice
to
mention
a
few
curious
examples

human
figure

a
supporter

fully
dealt
with

the
chapter
devoted
to
that
subject

head
it

borne
by

welsh
families

is
supposed
to
be
known

absence
of
a

the
englishman
head
which
is
borne
by
the
welsh
family
of
lloyd
of

has
no
very
distinctive
features
except
that
whilst
the
hair
and
beard
of
the
savage
are
generally
represented
brown
they
are
black
in
the
case
of
the
moor

fair
for
the
saxon

englishman
the
old
man
head
which
like
that
of
the
saxon

englishman
is
seldom
met
with
is
bald
and

bearded
but
for
all
practical
purposes
these
varieties
may
be
all
disregarded
except
the

the

the
heraldic
lion
heraldic
art
without
the
lion
would
not
amount
to
very
much
for
no
figure
plays
such
an
important
or
such
an
extensive
part
in
armory
as
the
lion
in
one
or
other
of
its
various
positions
these
positions
are
the
results
of
modern
differentiation
arising
from
the
necessity
of
a
larger
number
of
varying
coats
of
arms
but
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
in
early
times
the
majority
of
these
positions
did
not
exist
having
been
gradually
evolved
and
that
originally
the
heraldic
animal
was
just
a
lion
the
shape
of
the
shield
was
largely
a
governing
factor
in
the
manner
in
which
we
find
it
depicted
the
old
artists
with
a
keener
artistic
sense
than
is
evidenced
in
so
many
later
examples
of
heraldic
design
endeavoured
to
fill
up
as
large
a
proportion
of
the
space
available
as
was
possible
and
consequently
when
only
one
lion
was
to
be
depicted
upon
the
shield
they
very
naturally
drew
the
animal
in
an
upright
position
this
being
the
one
most
convenient
and
adaptable
for
their
purpose
probably
their
knowledge
of
natural
history
was
very
limited
and
this
upright
position
would
seem
to
them
the
most
natural
and
probably
was
the
only
one
they
knew
at
any
rate
at
first
it
is
almost
the
only
position
to
be
found
a
curious
commentary
upon
this
may
be
deduced
from
the
of
geoffrey
of
anjou
fig
which
shows
a
lion
this
lion
is
identically
of
the
form
and
shape
of
the
lions
rampant
upon
the
shield
but
from
the
nature
of
the
space
it
occupies
is
what
would
now
be
termed
statant
but
there
is
at
the
same
time
no
such
alteration
in
the
relative
position
of
the
limbs
as
would
now
be
required
this
would
seem
to
indicate
very
clearly
that
there
was
but
the
one
stereotyped
pattern
of
a
lion
which
answered
all
their
purposes
and
that
our
applied
that
one
pattern
to
the
spaces
they
desired
to
decorate
early
heraldry
however
when
the
various
positions
came
into
recognised
use
soon
sought
to
impose
this
definite
distinction
that
the
lion
could
only
be
depicted
erect
in
the
position
and
that
an
animal
represented
to
be
walking
must
therefore
be
a
from
the
very
position
which
it
occupied
this
however
was
a
distinction
known
only
to
the
more
pedantic
heralds
and
found
greatest
favour
amongst
the
french
but
we
find
in
glover
roll
which
is
a
copy
of
a
roll
originally
drawn
up
about
the
year
that
whilst
he
gives
lions
to
six
of
the
english
earls
he
commences
with
le
roy
porte
gules
trois
lupards
on
the
other
hand
the
monkish
chronicler
john
of
harmoustier
in
touraine
a
contemporary
writer
relates
that
when
henry
chose
geoffrey
son
of
foulk
earl
of
anjou
touraine
and
main
to
be
his
by
marrying
him
to
his
only
daughter
and
heir
maud
the
empress
and
made
him
knight
after
the
bathing
and
other
solemnities
pedes
ejus

leonculos

imaginarios
habens
collo
ejus
suspenditur
a
shield
with
lions
of
gold
therein
was
hung
about
his
neck
it
is
therefore
evident
that
the
refinement
of
distinction
between
a
lion
and
a
leopard
was
not
of
the
beginning
it
is
a
later
addition
to
the
earlier
simple
term
of
lion
this
distinction
having
been
invented
by
french
heralds
and
we
taking
so
much
of
our
heraldry
our
language
and
our
customs
from
france
adopted
and
to
a
certain
extent
used
this
description
of
lions
passant
as
leopards
there
can
be
no
doubt
however
that
the
lions
passant
guardant
upon
the
english
shield
have
always
been
represented
as
no
matter
what
they
may
have
been
called
and
the
use
of
the
term
leopard
in
heraldry
to
signify
a
certain
position
for
the
lion
never
received
any
extensive
sanction
and
has
long
since
become
obsolete
in
british
armory
in
french
blazon
however
the
old
distinction
is
still
observed
and
it
is
curious
to
observe
that
on
the
coins
of
the
channel
islands
the
shield
of
arms
distinctly
shows
three
leopards
the
french
lion
is
our
lion

french

is

term

our
lion

is
their
a
lion
rampant
and
any
other
beast
of
prey
is
usually
represented
in
heraldry
with
the
tongue
and
claws
of
a
different
colour
from
the
animal

it
is
not
itself

its
tongue

are
usually

as
of

colour

they
are
then
represented

the
term
being
armed
and

such
and
such
a
colour
it
is
not
necessary
to
mention
that
a
lion
is
armed
and
langued
in
the
blazon
when
tongue
and
claws
are
emblazoned
in
gules
but
whenever
any
other
colour
is
introduced
for
the
purpose
it
is
better
that
it
should
be
specified
outside
british
heraldry
a
lion
is
always
supposed
to
be
rampant
unless
otherwise
specifically
described
the
earliest
appearance
of
the
lions
in
the
arms
of
any
member
of
the
royal
family
in
england
would
appear
to
be
the
seal
of
king
john
when
he
was
prince
and
before
he
ascended
the
throne
this
seal
shows
his
arms
to
be
two
lions
passant
the
english
royal
crest
which
originated
with
richard
is
now
always
depicted
as
a
lion
statant
guardant
there
can
be
no
doubt
however
that
this
guardant
attitude
is
a
subsequent
derivation
from
the
position
of
the
lions
on
the
shield
when
heraldry
was
ceasing
to
be
actual
and
becoming
solely
pictorial
we
find
in
the
case
of
the
crest
of
edward
the
black
prince
now
suspended
over
his
tomb
in

cathedral

another
ancient
rule
belonging
to
the
same
period
as
the
controversy
between
leopards
and
lions
was
that
there
can
not
be
more
than
upon
a
shield
and
this
was
one
of
the
great
arguments
used
to
determine
that
the
charges
on
the
royal
arms
of
england
must
be
leopards
and
not
lions
it
was
admitted
as
a
rule
of
british
armory
to
a
limited
extent
that
when
two
or
more
lions
rampant
appeared
upon
the
same
shield
unless
combatant
they
were
always
formerly
described
as
lioncels

the

bohun

lioncels

british
heraldry
has
however
long

disregarded
any
such
rule

definite
rule

really
existed

point

curiously
enough

employment

can

typical
of

referring
perhaps
to
the
protection

they

possibly
merely
to
their

position

from
long
usage
we
have
grown
accustomed
to
consider
these
two
conjoined

dimidiated
figures
as
one
figure

in
the
recent

class

here
dimidiated

many

the
distinction
between
a
lion
passant

a
lion
statant
is
that
the
lion
statant
has
all
four
paws
resting
upon
the

usually
placed

no
means
rare

statant

this
term
is
a
curious
and
seemingly
a
purposeless
refinement
resulting
from
the
perpetuation
in
certain
cases
of
one
particular
method
of
depicting
the
crest
originally
when
a
crest
a
lion
was
always
so
drawn
but
it
can
not
be
overlooked
because
in
the
crests
of
both
talbot
earl
of
shrewsbury
and
percy
duke
of
northumberland
the
crest
is
now
stereotyped
as

note
that
in

days

such

features
of
our
national
life
the
genital
organ
was
always
represented
of
a
pronounced
size
in
a
prominent
position

it
was
as
much
a
matter
of
course
to
paint
it
gules
as
it
now
is
to
depict
the
tongue
of
that
colour
to
prevent
error
i
had
better
add
that
this
is
not
now
the
usual
practice
lions
placed
back

when
two
lions

one
passing
to
the
dexter
and
one
to
the
sinister
they
are
termed

term
is
however
also
used
sometimes
when
they
are
merely
passant

each
other

more
correct
description
in
such
cases
would
be
passant
respecting
or
regarding
each
other
the
term

one
stated
to
be
used
with
animals
other
than
lions

placed
in
a
rampant
position
whilst
doubtless
of
regular
acceptation
in
french
heraldry
as
applied
to
a
leopard
it
is
unknown
in
english
and
the
term
rampant
is
indifferently
applied
in
the
case
of
a
leopard
wolf
or
tiger
when
in
the
rampant

is
a
term
seldom
met
with
but
it
is
said
to
be
applied
for
example
to
a
cross

the
arms

i
have
yet
to
find
an

this

appropriately
considered

chapter
xii
beasts
next
after
the
lion
should
be
considered
the
tiger
but
it
must
be
distinctly
borne
in
mind
that
heraldry
knows
two
kinds
of
tigers
the
heraldic
tiger
figs
and
and
the
bengal
tiger
figs
and
doubtless
the
heraldic
tiger
which
was
the
only
one
found
in
british
armory
until
a
comparatively
recent
date
is
the
attempt
of
artists
to
depict
their
idea
of
a
tiger
the
animal
was
unknown
to
them
except
by
repute
and
consequently
the
creature
they
depicted
bears
little
relation
to
the
animal
of
real
life
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
their
intention
was
to
depict
an
animal
which
they
knew
to
exist
the
heraldic
tiger
had
a
body
much
like
the
natural
tiger
it
had
a
lion
tufted
tail
and
mane
and
the
curious
head
which
it
is
so
difficult
to
describe
but
which
appears
to
be
more
like
the
wolf
than
any
other
animal
we
know
this
however
will
be
again
dealt
with
in
the
chapter
on
fictitious
animals
and
is
here
only
introduced
to
demonstrate
the
difference
which
heraldry
makes
between
the
heraldic
tiger
and
the
real
animal
a
curious
conceit
is
that
the
heraldic
tiger
will
anciently
be
often
found
spelt
tyger
but
this
peculiar
spelling
does
not
seem
ever
to
have
been
applied
to
the
tiger

when
it
became
desirable
to
introduce
the
real
tiger
into
british
armory
as
typical
of
india
and
our
eastern
empire
something
of
course
was
necessary
to
distinguish
it
from
the
tyger
which
had
previously
usurped
the
name
in
armory
and
for
this
reason
the
natural
tiger
is
always
heraldically
known
as
the
bengal
tiger
this
armorial
variety
appears
towards
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
in
this
country
though
in
foreign
heraldry
it
appears
to
have
been
recognised
somewhat
earlier
there
are
however
but
few
cases
in
which
the
bengal
tiger
has
appeared
in
armory
and
in
the
majority
of
these
cases
as
a
supporter
as
in
the
supporters
of
outram
which
are
two
tigers
rampant
guardant
gorged
with

of
laurel

another
instance
of
the
tiger
as
a
supporter
will
be
found

instance
in
which
it
appears
as

has
to
a
certain
extent
been
referred
to
already
doubtless
it
is
the
peculiar
and
stealthy
walk
which
is
so
characteristic
of
the
leopard
which
led
to
any
animal
in
that
position
being
considered
a
leopard
but
the
leopard
in
its
natural
state
was
of
course
known
to
europeans
in
the
early
days
of
heraldry
and
appears
amongst
the
lists
of
heraldic
animals
apart
from
its
existence
as
a
lion
passant
the
animal
however
except
as
a
supporter
or

is
by
no
means
common
in

be

in

because
this
constitutes
the
difference
between
the
leopard

and
the

fig
the
face
is
by
far
the
most
usual
form
in
which
the
leopard
will
be
found
in
armory
and
can
be
traced
back
to
quite
an
early
period
in
heraldry

leopard

shows
no
neck

removed

then
represented

of
about
the
date
which
in
the
course
of
time
has
been
translated
into
every
tongue
mention
is
made
of
the
panther
to
which
is
there
ascribed
the
gaily
spotted
coat
and
the
pleasant
breath
which
induces
all
other
animals
to
approach
it
the
dragon
alone
retreats
into
its
hole
from
the
smell
and
consequently
the
panther
appears
to
have
sometimes
been
used
as
a
symbol
of
christ
the
earliest
armorial
representations
of
this
animal
show
the
form
not
greatly
dissimilar
to
nature
but
very
soon
the
similarity
disappears
in
continental
representations
and
the
fancy
of
the
artist
transferred
the
animal
into
the
fabulous
creature

is
now
represented

the
head
was
in

that

the
second
half
of
the
fourteenth
century

assume
the
character
of
claws
and
the
horns
of
the
animal
were
a
settled
matter
in
the
neighbourhood
of
lake
constance
we
find
the
panther
with
divided
hoofs
on
his
perhaps
with
a
reference
to
the
panther
cleanness
according
to
the
mosaic
law
of
course
a
animal
to
be
considered
clean
must
not
have
paws
and
a
ruminant
must
not
have
an
undivided
hoof
italian
heraldry
is
likewise
acquainted
with
the
panther
but
under
another
name
the

and
another
form

which
from
his

are
plainly
male

which
he
classes
with
the

and
probably
he
is
correct
in
looking
upon
our

the

the

however
in

has
a
less

character
it
being
sometimes
difficult
to
distinguish
the
wolf
from
some
other
heraldic
animals
this
is
one
of
these
cases
in
which
owing
to
insufficient
knowledge
and
crude
draughtsmanship
ancient
heraldry
is
not
to
be
preferred
to
more
realistic
treatment
the
is
a
very
frequent
crest
occurring
not
only
in
the
arms
and
crests
of
members
of
the
wilson
and
many
other
families
but
also
as
the
crest
of
wolfe
the
latter
crest
is
worthy
of
remark
inasmuch
as
the
royal
crown
which
is
held
within
its

typifies
the
assistance
given
to

charles
after

the

be
noted

tankard

a

of
this

heads
are
particularly
common
especially
in
scottish
heraldry
an
example
of
them

be

in

in

by

the

woodward
states
that
the

is
the
most
common
of
all
heraldic
animals
in
spanish
heraldry
where
it
is
frequently
represented
as
carrying

the
heraldic

of
the
two
animals

not
greatly
different
the
lynx
does
not
often
occur
in
heraldry
except
as
a
supporter
but
it
will
be
found
as
the
crest
of
the
family
of
lynch
the
lynx
is
nearly
always
depicted
and
blazoned
coward
with
its
tail
between
its

another
instance
of
this
particular
animal
is

in
the
crest

a

the
similarity

representation

often
confused
with
a
wolf

said
by
woodward
to
be
very
seldom
met
with
in
british
heraldry
this
is
hardly
a
correct
statement
inasmuch
as
countless
instances
can
be
produced
in
which
a
fox
figures
as
a
charge
a
crest

a
supporter
the
fox

found
on

will
be
found
amongst
others
in

for
example
of

probably
the
most
curious

scottish
is
an
animal
which
with
its
parts
will
constantly
be
met
with
in
british
armory
figs
theoretically
there
is
a
difference
between
the
boar
which
is
the
male
of
the
domestic
animal
and
the
wild
boar
which
is
the
untamed
creature
of
the
woods
whilst
the
latter
is
usually
blazoned
as
a
wild
boar
or
sanglier
the
latter
is
just
a
boar
but
for
all
practical
purposes
no
difference
whatever
is
made
in
heraldic
representations
of
these
varieties
though
it
may
be
noted
that
the
crest
of
swinton
is
often
described
as
a
sanglier
as
invariably
is
also
the
crest
of
douglas
earl
of
morton
a
sanglier
sticking
between
the
cleft
of
an
fructed
with
a
lock
holding
the
clefts
together
all
proper
the
boar
like
the
lion
is
usually
described
as
armed
and
langued
but
this
is
not
necessary
when
the
tusks
are
represented
in
their
own
colour
and
when
the
tongue
is
gules
it
will
however
be
very
frequently
found
that
the
tusks
are
or
the
armed
however
does
not
include
the
hoofs
and
if
these
are
to
be
of
any
colour
different
from
that
of
the
animal
it
must
be
blazoned
unguled
of
such
and
such
a
tincture
precisely
the
same
distinction
occurs
in
the
heads
of
boars
figs
that
was
referred
to
in
bears
the
real
difference
is
this
that
whilst
the
english
boar
head
has
the
neck
attached
to
the
head
and
is
couped
or
erased
at
the
shoulders
the
scottish
boar
head
is
separated
close
behind
the
ears
no
one
ever
troubled
to
draw
any
distinction
between
the
two
for
the
purposes
of
blazon
because
the
english
boars
heads
were
more
usually
drawn
with
the
neck
and
the
boars
heads
in
scotland
were
drawn
couped
or
erased
close
but
the
boars
head
in
welsh
heraldry
followed
the
scottish
and
not
the
english
type
matters
armorial
however
are
now
cosmopolitan
and
one
can
no
longer
ascertain
that
the
crest
of
campbell
must
be
scottish
or
that
the
crest
of
any
other
family
must
be
english
and
consequently
though
the
terms
will
not
be
found
employed
officially
it
is
just
as
well
to
distinguish
them
because
armory
can
provide
means
of
such
distinction
the
true
description
of
an
english
boar
head
being
couped
or
erased
at
the
neck
the
scottish
term
being
a
boar
head
couped
or
erased
close
occasionally
a
boar
head
will
be
stated
to
be
borne
erect
this
is
then
shown
with
the
mouth
pointing
upwards
a
curious
example
of
this
is
found
in
the
crest
of
tyrrell

woodward
mentions
three
very
strange
coats

arms

which
the
charge
whilst
not
being
a
boar
bears
very
close
connection
with
it

states
that
among
the
curiosities

there

that

i

three

sable
armed

has
been
that
during
the
last
century
they
were
jumped
right

left
by
people
of
the
name

cooper
entirely
in
ignorance
of
the
fact

the

indicate

the
ludicrous

been

stood

in

it
has
become

it

heraldry
generally
finds
some
way
of
stereotyping
one
of
its
creations
as
peculiarly
its
own
and
in
regard
to
the
elephant
the
curious
elephant

is
an
example

object
being

simply
a

of

castle
the
elephant
and
castle
is
seen
in
the
arms
of
dumbarton
and
in
the
crest
of
corbet
a
curious
practice
the
result
of
pure
ignorance
has
manifested
itself
in
british
armory
as
will
be
explained
in
the
chapter
upon
crests
a
large
proportion
of
german
crests
are
derivatives
of
the
stock
basis
of
two
bull
horns
which
formed
a
recognised
ornament
for
a
helmet
in
viking
and
other
days
as
heraldry
found
its
footing
it
did
not
in
germany
displace
those
horns
which
in
many
cases
continued
alone
as
the
crest
or
remained
as
a
part
of
it
in
the
form
of
additions
to
other
objects
the
craze
for
decoration
at
an
early
period
seized
upon
the
horns
which
carried
repetitions
of
the
arms
or
their
tinctures
as
time
went
on
the
decoration
was
carried
further
and
the
horns
were
made
with
open
ends
to
receive
other
objects
usually
bunches
of
feathers
or
flowers
so
universal
did
this
custom
become
that
even
when
nothing
was
inserted
the
horns
came
to
be
always
depicted
with
these
open
mouths
at
their
points
but
german
heraldry
now
as
has
always
been
the
case
simply
terms
the
figures
horns
in
course
of
time
german
immigrants
made
application
for
grants
of
arms
in
this
country
which
doubtless
were
based
upon
other
german
arms
previously
in
use
but
which
evidence
of
right
not
being
forthcoming
could
not
be
recorded
as
borne
of
right
and
needed
to
be
granted
with
alteration
as
a
new
coat
the
curious
result
has
been
that
these
horns
have
been
incorporated
in
some
number
of
english
grants
but
they
have
universally
been
described
as
elephants
proboscides
and
are
now
always
so
represented

for
special
and
sufficient
reasons
in

isolated

be
it
from
me
however
to
make
any
remark

should
seem
to
indicate
the
raising
of
any
objection
to
such
use
in
my
opinion
it
is
highly
admirable
providing
there
is
some
definite
reason
in
each
case
for
the
introduction
of
these
strange
animals
other
than
mere
caprice
they
add
to
the
interest
of
heraldry
and
they
give
to
modern
arms

a
definite
status

meaning
which
is
a
relief
from
the
endless
monotony
of
meaningless
lions

chevrons
mullets

martlets
but
at
the
same
time
the
isolated
use
in
a
modern

of
such
an
animal
as
the
kangaroo
does
not
make
it
one
of
the
peculiarly
heraldic
menagerie
and
consequently
such
instances
must
be
dismissed
herein

brief
mention

xiii
monsters
the
heraldic
catalogue
of
beasts
runs
riot
when
we
reach
those
mythical
or
legendary
creatures
which
can
only
be
summarised
under
the
generic
term
of
monsters
most
mythical
animals
however
can
be
traced
back
to
some
comparable
counterpart
in
natural
history
the
fauna
of
the
new
world
was
of
course
unknown
to
those
early
heraldic
artists
in
whose
knowledge
and
imagination
no
less
than
in
their
skill
or
lack
of
it
in
draughtsmanship
lay
the
nativity
of
so
much
of
our
heraldry
they
certainly
thought
they
were
representing
animals
in
existence
in
most
if
not
in
all
cases
though
one
gathers
that
they
considered
many
of
the
animals
they
used
to
be
misbegotten
hybrids
doubtless
working
on
the
assumption
of
the
mule
as
the
hybrid
of
the
horse
and
the
ass
they
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
animals
which
contained
salient
characteristics
of
two
other
animals
which
they
knew
were
likewise
hybrids
a
striking
example
of
their
theories
is
to
be
found
in
the
heraldic
camelopard
which
was
anciently
devoutly
believed
to
be
begotten
by
the
leopard
upon
the
camel
a
leopard
they
would
be
familiar
with
also
the
camel
for
both
belong
to
that
corner
of
the
world
where
the
of
the
african
continent
the
of
europe
and
the
west
of
asia
join
where
were
fought
out
the
wars
of
the
cross
and
where
heraldry
took
on
itself
a
definite
being
there
the
known
civilisations
of
the
world
met
taking
one
from
the
other
knowledge
more
or
less
distorted
ideas
and
wild
imaginings
a
stray
giraffe
was
probably
seen
by
some
journeyer
up
the
nile
who
unable
to
otherwise
account
for
it
considered
and
stated
the
animal
to
be
the
hybrid
offspring
of
the
leopard
and
camel
another
point
needs
to
be
borne
in
mind
earlier
artists
were
in
no
way
fettered
by
any
supposed
necessity
for
making
their
pictures
realistic
representations
realism
is
a
modernity
their
pictures
were
decoration
and
they
thought
far
more
of
making
their
subject
fit
the
space
to
be
decorated
than
of
making
it
a
speaking
likeness
nevertheless
their
work
was
not
all
imagination
in
the
we
get
the
basis
of
the
dragon
if
indeed
the
heraldic
dragon
be
not
a
perpetuation
of
ancient
legends
or
even
perhaps
of
then
existing
representations
of
those
winged
antediluvian
animals
the
fossilised
remains
of
which
are
now
available
wings
however
need
never
be
considered
a
difficulty
it
has
ever
been
the
custom
from
the
angels
of
christianity
to
the
personalities
of
mercury
and
pegasus
to
add
wings
to
any
figure
held
in
veneration
why
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
but
nevertheless
the
fact
remains
however
it
is
not
easy
to
resolve
into
an
original
basis
because
until
the
seventeenth
century
every
one
fondly
believed
in
the
existence
of
the
animal
beckles
wilson
appears
to
have
paid
considerable
attention
to
the
subject
and
was
responsible
for
the
article
the
rise
of
the
unicorn
which
recently
appeared
in
that
writer
traces
the
matter
to
a
certain
extent
from
sources
and
the
following
remarks
which
are
taken
from
the
above
article
are
of
considerable
interest
the
real
genesis
of
the
unicorn
was
probably
this
at
a
time
when
armorial
bearings
were
becoming
an
indispensable
part
of
a
noble
equipment
the
attention
of
those
knights
who
were
fighting
under
the
banner
of
the
cross
was
attracted
to
the
wild
antelopes
of
syria
and
palestine
these
animals
are
armed
with
long
straight
spiral
horns
set
close
together
so
that
at
a
side
view
they
appeared
to
be
but
a
single
horn
to
confirm
this
there
are
some
old
illuminations
and
drawings
extant
which
endow
the
early
unicorn
with
many
of
the
attributes
of
the
deer
and
goat
kind
the
sort
of
horn
supposed
to
be
carried
by
these
eastern
antelopes
had
long
been
a
curiosity
and
was
occasionally
brought
back
as
a
trophy
by
travellers
from
the
remote
parts
of
the
earth
there
is
a
fine
one
to
be
seen
at
the
abbey
of
denis
and
others
in
various
collections
in
europe
we
now
know
these
unicorn
horns
usually
carved
to
belong
to
that
marine
monster
the
narwhal
or
but
the
fable
of
a
breed
of
horned
horses
is
at
least
as
old
as
pliny
had
the
gnu
anything
to
do
with
this
and
centuries
later
the
crusaders
or
the
monkish
artists
who
accompanied
them
attempted
to
delineate
the
marvel
from
their
first
rude
sketches
other
artists
copied
and
so
each
presentment
was
passed
along
until
at
length
the
present
form
of
the
unicorn
was
attained
there
was
a
time
not
so
long
ago
when
the
existence
of
the
unicorn
was
as
implicitly
believed
in
as
the
camel
or
any
other
animal
not
seen
in
these
latitudes
and
the
translators
of
the
bible
set
their
seal
upon
the
legend
by
translating
the
hebrew
word
which
probably
meant
a
rhinoceros
as
thus
the
worthy
thomas
fuller
came
to
consider
the
existence
of
the
unicorn
clearly
proved
by
the
mention
of
it
in
scripture
describing
the
horn
of
the
animal
he
writes
are
plain
as
that
of
mark
in
venice
others
wreathed
about
it
which
probably
is
the
effect
of
age
those
wreaths
being
but
the
wrinkles
of
most
vivacious
unicorns
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
colour
white
when
newly
taken
from
the
head
yellow
like
that
lately
in
the
tower
of
some
hundred
years
seniority
but
whether
or
no
it
will
soon
turn
black
as
that
of
plinie
description
let
others
decide
all
the
books
on
natural
history
so
late
as
the
seventeenth
century
describe
at
length
the
unicorn
several
of
them
carefully
depict
him
as
though
the
artist
had
drawn
straight
from
the
life
if
art
had
stopped
here
the
wonder
of
the
unicorn
would
have
remained
but
a
paltry
thing
after
all
his
finer
qualities
would
have
been
unrecorded
and
all
his
virtues
hidden
but
happily
instead
of
this
about
the
animal
first
conceived
in
the
brain
of
a
greek
as
pegasus
also
was
and
embodied
through
the
fertile
fancy
of
the
crusader
the
monks
and
heraldists
of
the
middle
ages
devised
a
host
of
spiritual
legends
they
told
of
his
pride
his
purity
his
endurance
his
matchless
spirit
greatnesse
of
his
mynde
is
such
that
he
chooseth
rather
to
dye
than
be
taken
alive
indeed
he
was
only
conquerable
by
a
beautiful
maiden
one
writer
gives
a
recipe
for
catching
a
unicorn
maid
is
set
where
he
hunteth
and
she
openeth
her
lap
to
whom
the
unicorn
as
seeking
rescue
from
the
force
of
the
hunter
yieldeth
his
head
and
leaveth
all
his
fierceness
and
resteth
himself
under
her
protection

he
is

many
were

enticed

there
is
one
in

such
an
animal

held

eight
spans
and
a
half

valued
at

may
have
been
the
one
now
at

one

describing

says

though
in
the
popular
mind
any
heraldic
monster
is
generically
termed
a
griffin
the
griffin
has
nevertheless
very
marked
and
distinct
peculiarities
it
is
one
of
the
hybrid
monstrosities
which
heraldry
is
so
fond
of
and
is
formed
by
the
body
and
tail
of
a
lion
conjoined
to
the
head
and
claws
of
an
eagle
the
latter
acting
as
its
forepaws
figs
it
has
the
wings
of
the
eagle
which
are
never
represented
close
but
it
also
has
ears
and
this
by
the
way
should
be
noted
because
herein
is
the
only
distinction
between
a
griffin
head
and
an
eagle
head
when
the
rest
of
the
body
is
not

though
but
very
seldom

met

it

by
which
description
is
meant
that
the
plumage
is
of
the
brown
colour
of
the
eagle
the
rest
of
the
body
being
the
natural
colour
of
the
lion
the
griffin
is
frequently
found
with
its
beak
and
of
a
different
colour
from
its
body
and
is
then
termed
armed
though
another
term
beaked
and
is
almost
as
frequently
used
a
very
popular
idea
is
that
the
origin
of
the
griffin
was
the
dimidiation
of
two
coats
of
arms
one
having
an
eagle
and
the
other
a
lion
as
charges
but
taking
the
origin
of
armory
to
belong
to
about
the
end
of
the
eleventh
century
or
thereabouts
the
griffin
can
be
found
as
a
distinct
creation
not
necessarily
heraldic
at
a
very
much
earlier
date
an
exceedingly
good

an
early

is

may
be
here
referred

a

by
some
curious

has
no

is

at
some
number
of
points
on

i
have
under
my
remarks
upon
the

hazarded
the
supposition
that
the
male
griffin
of
english
heraldry
is
nothing
more
than
a
british
development
and
form
of
the
continental
heraldic
panther
which
is
unknown
to
us
the
origin
of
the
clusters
and
spikes
unless
they
are
to
be
found
in
the
flames
of

associated
with
the
panther
must
remain
a
mystery
the
male
griffin
is
very
seldom
met
with
but
two
of
these
creatures
are
the
supporters
of
sir
george
john
egerton
dashwood

whilst
we
consider
the
griffin
a
purely
mythical
animal
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
earlier
writers
devoutly
believed
that
such
animals
existed
sir
john
maundeville
tells
us
in

that
they
abound

more

such
as
we
han
amonges
us
and
other
writers
whilst
not
considering
them
an
original
type
of
animal
undoubtedly
believed
in
their
existence
as
hybrid
of
the
eagle
and
the
lion
it
is
of
course
a
fact
that
the
mule
the
most
popular
hybrid
does
not
breed
this
fact
would
be
accepted
as
accounting
for
the
rarity
of
animals
which
were
considered
to
be
hybrids
though
there
are
examples
of
griffins
in
some
of
the
earliest
rolls
of
arms
the
animal
can
not
be
said
to
have
come
into
general
use
until
a
somewhat
later
period
nowadays
however
it
is
probably
next
in
popularity
to
the
lion

very
frequently

still
yet
more

the

the
similarity
of
appearance
is
more
superficial
than
real
inasmuch
as
in
all
details
it
differs
except
in
the
broad
similarity
that
it
has
four
legs
a
pair
of
wings
and
is
a
terrible
creature
the

referred

the
head
of
a
dragon
is
like
nothing
else
in
heraldry
and
from
what
source
it
originated
or
what
basis
existed
for
ancient
heraldic
artists
to
imagine
it
from
must
remain
a
mystery

it
has
developed
from
the
crocodile
or
some
antediluvian
animal
much
akin
it
is
like
nothing
else
in

on
earth
its
neck
is
covered
with
scales
not
unlike
those
of
a
fish
all
four
legs
are
scaled
and
have
claws
the
back
is
scaled
the
tongue
is
barbed
and
the
under
part
of
the
body
is
likewise
scaled
but
here
in
rolls
of
a
much
larger
size
great
differences
will
be
found
in
the
shape
of
the
ears
but
the
wings
of
the
dragon
are
always
represented
as
the
wings
of
a
bat

the
long
ribs
or
bones
carried

base
figs
the
dragon
is
one
of
the
most
artistic
of
heraldic
creations
and
lends
itself
very
readily
to
the
genius
of
any
artist
in
nearly
all
modern
representations
the
tail
like
the
tongue
will
be
found
ending
in
a
barb
but
it
should
be
observed
that
this
is
a
comparatively
recent
addition
all
dragons
of
the
tudor
period
were
invariably
represented
without
any
such
additions
to
their
tails
the
tail
was
long
and
smooth
ending
in
a
blunt
point
whilst
we
have
separate
and
distinct
names
for
many
varieties
of
creatures
other
countries
in
their
use
of
the
word
dragon
include
the
wyvern
basilisk
cockatrice
and
other
similar
creatures
but
the
distinct
name
in
german
heraldry
for
our
dragon
is
the
and
fig
is
a
representation
of
the
dragon
according
to
german
ideas
which
nevertheless
might
form
an
example
for
english
artists
to
copy
except
that
we
very
seldom
represent
ours

whose
liking

is
evidenced
by

and

also
changed

hold
that

not

there
is
some
room
for

whether

was
really
of
welsh

there
is
no
difference
whatever
between
a
wyvern
head
and
a
dragon
but
there
is
considerable
difference
between
a
wyvern
and
a
dragon
at
any
rate
in
english
heraldry
though
the
wyvern
appears
to
be
the
form
more
frequently
met
with
under
the
name
of
a
dragon
in
other
countries
the
wyvern
has
only
two
legs
the
body
curling
away
into
the
tail
and
it
is
usually
represented
as
resting
upon
its
legs
and
tail
figs
and
on
the
other
hand
it
will
occasionally
be
found
sitting
erect
upon
its
tail
with
its
claws
in
the
air
fig
and
the
supporters
of
the
duke
of
marlborough
are
generally
so
represented
as
a
charge
or
crest
however
probably
the
only
instance
of
a
wyvern
sejant
erect
is
the
crest
of
mansergh
a
curious
crest
also
is
that
of
langton
namely
on
a
wreath
of
the
colours
an
eagle
or
and
a
wyvern
vert
interwoven
and
erect
on
their
tails
and
an
equally
curious
one
is
the
crest
of
maule
a
wyvern
vert
with
two
heads
vomiting
fire
at
both
ends
proper
charged
with
a
crescent
argent
occasionally
the
wyvern
is
represented
without
wings
and
with
the
tail
nowed
both
these
peculiarities
occur
in
the
case
of
the
crest
of
a
lancashire
family
named
ffarington
the
next
variety
is
the
cockatrice
fig
which
is
however
comparatively
rare
two
cockatrices
are
the
supporters
to
the
arms
of
the
earl
of
westmeath
and
also
to
the
arms
of
sir
edmund
charles
nugent
bart
but
the
animal
is
not
common
as
a
charge
the
difference
between
a
wyvern
and
a
cockatrice
is
that
the
latter
has
the
head
of
a
cock
substituted
for
the
dragon
head
with
which
the
wyvern
is
decorated
like
the
cock
the
beak
comb
and
wattles
are
often
of
another
tincture
and
the
animal
is
then
termed
armed
combed
and
wattled
illustration

the
cockatrice
is
sometimes
termed
a
and
according
to
ancient
writers
the
basilisk
is
produced
from
an
egg
laid
by
a
cock
and
hatched
by
a
toad
on
a
dunghill
probably
this
is
merely
the
expression
of
the
intensified
loathing
which
it
was
desired
to
typify
but
the
heraldic
basilisk
is
stated
to
have
its
tail
terminating
in
a
head
in
english
heraldry
at
any
rate
i
know
of
no
such
example
or
as
the

is
ascribed
to
the

camelopard
fig
which
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
an
ordinary
giraffe
must
be
properly
included
amongst
mythical
animals
because
the
form
and
semblance
of
the
giraffe
was
used
to
represent
a
mythical
hybrid
creation
which
the
ancients
believed
to
be
begotten
between
a
leopard
and
a
camel
possibly
they
represented
the
real
giraffe
which
they
may
have

bird
which

the
and
in

this

invariably
be
found
displayed
a
eagle
displayed
from
a
byzantine
silk
of
the
tenth
century
is
illustrated
by
eve
in
his
decorative
heraldry
so
that
it
is
evident
that
neither
the
eagle
displayed
nor
the
eagle
originated
with
the
science
of
armory
which
appropriated
them
together
with
their
symbolism
an
eagle
displayed
as
a
symbolical
device
was
certainly
in
use
by
charlemagne
it
may
perhaps
here
be
advantageous
to
treat
of
the
artistic
development
of
the
eagle
displayed
of
this
of
course
the
earliest
prototype
is
the
roman
eagle
of
the
cæsars
and
it
will
be
to
english
eyes
accustomed
to
our
conventional
doubtless
rather
startling
to
observe
that
the
german
type
of
the
eagle
which
follows
the
roman
disposition
of
the
wings
which
so
many
of
our
heraldic
artists
at
the
present
day
appear
inclined
to
adopt
either
in
the
accepted
german
or
in
a
slightly
modified
form
as
an
eagle
displayed
is
certainly
not
a
true
displayed
eagle
according
to
our
english
ideas
and
requirements
inasmuch
as
the
wings
are
inverted
it
should
be
observed
that
in
german
heraldry
it
is
simply
termed
an
eagle
and
not
an
eagle
displayed
considering
however
its
very
close
resemblance
to
our
eagle
displayed
and
also
its
very
artistic
appearance
there
is
every
excuse
for
its
employment
in
this
country
and
i
for
one
should
be
sorry
to
observe
its
slowly
increasing
favour
checked
in
this
country
it
is
quite
possible
however
to
transfer
the
salient
and
striking
points
of
beauty
to
the
more
orthodox
position
of
the
wings
the
eagle
compared
with
the
lion
and
the
ordinaries
had
no
such
predominance
in
early
british
heraldry
that
it
enjoyed
in
continental
armory
and
therefore
it
may
be
better
to
trace
the
artistic
development
of
the
german
eagle
in
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
the
eagle
appears
with
the
head
raised
and
the
beak
closed
the
bones
of
the
wings
are
rolled
up
at
the
ends
like
a
snail
and
the
pinions
like
the
talons
take
a
vertical
downward
direction
the
tail
composed
of
a
number
of
stiff
feathers
frequently
issues
from
a
knob
or
ball
compare

herewith
with
the
end
of
the
fourteenth
century

head
straightens
itself
the
beak
opens
and
the
tongue
becomes
visible

up
of
the
gradually
disappears
and
the
claws
form
an
acute
angle
with
the
direction
of
the
body

at
this
period
the
claws
occasionally

used

is
simply
blazoned

being
employed
without
any
additional
distinctive
terms

obtain
any
certain
information

from

this

is
eminently
unsatisfactory
because
in

no
heraldic

of

has
claimed

the
origin
of
the
eagle
fig
has
been
the
subject
of
endless
controversy
the
tale
one
is
usually
taught
to
believe
being
that
it
originated
in
the
dimidiation
upon
one
shield
of
two
separate
coats
of
arms
nisbet
states
that
the
imperial
eagle
was
not
one
eagle
with
two
heads
but
two
eagles
the
one
laid
upon
the
other
and
their
heads
separate
looking
different
ways
which
represent
the
two
heads
of
the
empire
after
it
was
divided
into
east
and
west
the
whole
discussion
is
an
apt
example
of
the
habit
of
earlier
writers
to
find
or
provide
hidden
meanings
and
symbolisms
when
no
such
meanings
existed
the
real
truth
undoubtedly
is
that
the
eagle
was
an
accepted
figure
long
before
heraldry
came
into
existence
and
that
when
the
displayed
eagle
was
usurped
by
armory
as
one
of
its
peculiarly
heraldic
figures
the
and
varieties
were
used
indifferently
until
the
eagle
became
stereotyped
as
the
imperial
emblem
napoleon
however
reverted
to
the
eagle
and
the
present
german
imperial
eagle
has
likewise
only
one
head
illustration
fig
napoleonic

the
imperial
eagle
of
napoleon
had
little
in
keeping
with
then
existing
armorial
types
of
the
bird
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
model
upon
which
it
was
based
was
the
roman
eagle
of
the
cæsars
as
it
figured
upon
the
head
of
the
roman
standards
in
english
terms
of
blazon
the
napoleonic
eagle
would
be
an
eagle
displayed
with
wings
inverted
the
head
to
the
sinister
standing
upon
a
thunderbolt
or
fig
the
then
existing
eagles
of
austria
and
russia
probably
supply
the
reason
why
when
the
german
empire
was
created
the
prussian
eagle
in
a
modified
form
was
preferred
to
the
resuscitation
of
the
older
eagle
which
had
theretofore
been
more
usually
accepted
as
the
symbol
of
empire
by
the
same
curious
idea
which
was
noticed
in
the
earlier
chapter
upon
lions
and
which
ruled
that
the
mere
fact
of
the
appearance
of
two
or
more
lions
rampant
in
the
same
coat
of
arms
made
them
into
lioncels
so
more
than
one
eagle
upon
a
shield
resulted
sometimes
in
the
birds
becoming
eaglets

a
rule
has
never
had
official
recognition

difference
is
made

next

for
consideration
considering
the
very
important
part
this
bird
played
in
the
social
life
of
earlier
centuries
this
can
not
be
a
matter
of
any
surprise
heraldry
in
its
emblazonment
makes
no
distinction
between
the
appearance
of
the
hawk
and
the
falcon
but
for
canting
and
other
reasons
the
bird
will
be
found
described
by
all
its
different
names
in
the
arms
of
hobson
to
preserve
the
obvious
pun
the
two
birds
are
blazoned
as
hobbies
the
falcon
is
frequently
more
often
than
not
found
belled
with
the
slovenliness
or
some
may
exalt
it
into
the
virtue
of
freedom
from
irritating
restriction
characteristic
of
many
matters
in
heraldic
blazon
the
simple
term
belled
is
found
used
indiscriminately
to
signify
that
the
falcon
is
belled
on
one
leg
or
belled
on
both
and
if
it
is
belled
the
bell
must
of
necessity
be
on
a
jess
others
state
that
every
falcon
must
of
necessity
whether
so
blazoned
or
not
be
belled
upon
at
least
one
leg
and
that
when
the
term
belled
is
used
it
signifies
that
it
is
belled
upon
both
legs
there
is
still
yet
another
alternative
viz
that
when
belled
it
has
the
bell
on
only
one
leg
but
that
when
jessed
and
belled
it
is
belled
on
both
legs
the
jess
is
the
leather
thong
with
which
the
bells
are
attached
to
the
leg
and
it
is
generally
considered
and
this
may
be
accepted
that
when
the
term
jessed
is
included
in
the
wording
of
the
blazon
the
jesses
are
represented
with
the
ends
flying
loose
unless
the
use
of
the
term
is
necessitated
by
the
jesses
being
of
a
different
colour
when
the
term
vervelled
is
also
employed
it
signifies
that
the
jesses
have
small
rings
attached
to
the
floating
ends
in
actual
practice
however
it
should
be
remembered
that
if
the
bells
and
jesses
are
of
a
different
colour
the
use
of
the
terms
jessed
and
belled
is
essential
a
falcon
is
seldom
drawn
without
at
least
one
bell
and
when
it
is
found
described
as
belled
in
most
cases
it
will
be
found
that
the
intention
is
that
it
shall
have
two
bells
like
all
other
birds
of
prey
the
falcon
may
be
armed
a
technical
term
which
theoretically
should
include
the
beak
and
legs
but
in
actual
practice
a
falcon
will
be
far
more
usually
found
described
as
beaked
and
legged
when
these
differ
in
tincture
from
its
plumage
when
a
falcon
is
blindfolded
it
is
termed
hooded
it
was
always
so
carried
on
the
wrist
until
it
was
flown
the
position
of
the
wings
and
the
confusion
in
the
terms
applied
thereto
is
even
more
marked
in
the
case
of
the
falcon
than
the
eagle
are
not
very
frequently
met
with
but
an
example
occurs
in
the
crest
of
jerningham
a
falcon
head
is
constantly
met
with
as
a
crest
when
a
falcon
is
represented
preying
upon
anything
it
is
termed
trussing
its
prey
though
sometimes
the
description
preying
upon
is
perhaps
less
accurately
employed
examples
of
this
will
be
found
in
the
arms
of
madden

hawk

trussing

mallard

in

crest
of
joscelin
illustration
fig
pelican
in
her
piety
with
its
curious
heraldic
representation
and
its
strange
terms
may
almost
be
considered
an
instance
of
the
application
of
the
existing
name
of
a
bird
to
an
entirely
fanciful
creation
eve
in
his
decorative
heraldry
states
that
in
early
representations
of
the
bird
it
was
depicted
in
a
more
naturalistic
form
but
i
confess
i
have
not
myself
met
with
such
an
ancient
representation
heraldically
it
has
been
practically
always
depicted
with
the
head
and
body
of
an
eagle
with
wings
elevated
and
with
the
neck
embowed
pecking
with
its
beak
at
its
breast
the
term
for
this
is
vulning
itself
and
although
it
appears
to
be
necessary
always
to
describe
it
in
the
blazon
as
vulning
itself
it
will
never
be
met
with
save
in
this
position
a
pelican
head
even
when
erased
at
the
neck
being
always
so
represented
it
is
supposed
to
be
pecking
at
its
breast
to
provide
drops
of
blood
as
nourishment
for
its
young
and
it
is
termed
in
its
piety
when
depicted
standing
in
its
nest
and
with
its
brood
of
young
fig
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
how
the
pelican
came
to
be
considered
as
always
existing
in
this
position
because
there
is
nothing
in
the
nature
of
a
natural
habit
from
which
this
could
be
derived
there
are
however
other
birds
which
during
the
brooding
season
lose
their
feathers
upon
the
breast
and
some
which
grow
red
feathers
there
and
it
is
doubtless
from
this
that
the
idea
originated
in
heraldic
and
ecclesiastical
symbolism
the
pelican
has
acquired
a
somewhat
sacred
character
as
typical
of
maternal
solicitude
it
will
never
be
found
close
or
in
any
other
positions
than
with
the
wings
endorsed
and
either
elevated
or
inverted
when
blazoned
proper
it
is
always
given
the
colour
and
plumage
of
the
eagle
and
not
its
natural
colour
of
white
in
recent
years
however
a
tendency
has
rather
made
itself
manifest
to
give
the
pelican
its
natural
and
more
ungainly
appearance
and
its
curious
pouched
beak
fig
is
doubtless
the
bird
which
is
most
frequently
met
with
as
a
crest
after
the
falcon
unless
it
be
the
dove
or
martlet
the
ostrich
is
heraldically
emblazoned
in
a
very
natural
manner
and
it
is
difficult
to
understand
why
in
the
case
of
such
a
bird
heraldic
artists
of
earlier
days
should
have
remained
so
true
to
the
natural
form
of
the
bird
whilst
in
other
cases
in
which
they
could
have
had
no
less
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
bird
greater
variation
is
to
be
found
as
a
charge
upon
a
shield
it
is
not
very
common
although
instances
are
to
be
found
in
the
arms
of
macmahon

ostrich

its
beak

it
is
curious
that
until
quite
recent
times
the
ostrich
is
never
met
with
heraldically
unless
holding
a
a
key
or
some
other
piece
of
old
iron
in
its
beak
the
digestive
capacity
of
the
ostrich
though
somewhat
exaggerated
is
by
no
means
fabulous
and
in
the
earliest
forms
of
its
representation
in
all
the
old
natural
history
books
it
is
depicted
feeding
upon
this
unnatural
food
if
this
were
the
popular
idea
of
the
bird
small
wonder
is
it
that
heraldic
artists
perpetuated
the
idea
and
even
now
the
heraldic
ostrich
is
seldom
seen
without
a
key
or
a
in
its
beak
the
ostrich
head
alone
is
sometimes
met
with

course
play
a
large
part
in

the
consideration
of
these
may
be
postponed
for
the
moment
until
the
feathers
of
cocks
and
peacocks
can
be
added
thereto
at
least
the
heraldic
bird
has
one
curious
peculiarity
it
is
always
represented
with
a
slight
tuft
on
its
head

considers
this
to
be
merely
the
perpetuation
of
some
case
in
which
the
crude
draughtsman
has
added
a
tuft
to
its
head
possibly
he
is
correct
but
i
think
it
may
be
an
attempt
to
distinguish
between
the
domestic
dove
and
the
both
of
which
varieties
would
be
known
to
the
early
heraldic
artists
the
dove
with
an
olive
branch
in
its
beak
is
constantly
and
continually
met
with
when
blazoned
proper
it
is
quite
correct
to
make
the
legs
and
feet
of
the
natural
pinky
colour
but
it
will
be
more
usually
found
that
a
dove
is
specifically
described
as
legged
gules
the
ordinary
heraldic
dove
will
be
found
most
frequently
represented
with
its
wings
close
and
holding
a
branch
of
laurel
in
its
beak
but
it
also
occurs
volant
and
with
outstretched
wings

is
then
frequently
termed
a
dove

the
doves

arms
of
the
college
of
arms
are
always
represented
with
the
sinister
wing
close
and
the
dexter
wing
extended
and
inverted
this
has
given
rise
to
much
curious
speculation
but
whatever
may
be
the
reason
of
the
curious
position
of
the
wings
there
can
be
very
little
doubt
that
the
coat
of

itself
is
based
upon
the
coat
of
edward

the
coat
of
edward
the
confessor
is
a
cross
patonce
between
five
martlets
but
it
is
pretty
generally
agreed
that
these
martlets
are
a
corruption
of
the
doves
which
figure
upon
his
coins

one
of
which
surmounts
the

is

illustration
fig

is
another
example
of
the
curious
perpetuation
in
heraldry
of
the
popular
errors
of
natural
history
even
at
the
present
day
in
many
parts
of
the
country
it
is
popularly
believed
that
a
swallow
has
no
feet
or
at
any
rate
can
not
perch
upon
the
ground
or
raise
itself
therefrom
the
fact
that
one
never
does
see
a
swallow
upon
the
ground
supports
the
foundation
of
the
idea
at
any
rate
the
heraldic
swallow
which
is
known
as
the
martlet
is
never
represented
with
feet
the
legs
terminating
in
the
feathers
which
cover
the
upper
parts
of
the
leg
fig
it
is
curious
that
the
same
idea
is
perpetuated
in
the
little
legend
of
the
explanation
which
may
or
may
not
be
wholly
untrue
that
the
reason
the
martlet
has
been
adopted
as
the
mark
of
cadency
for
the
fourth
son
is
to
typify
the
fact
that
whilst
the
eldest
son
succeeds
to
his
father
lands
and
whilst
the
second
son
may
succeed
perhaps
to
the
mother
there
can
be
very
little
doubt
that
by
the
time
the
fourth
son
is
reached
there
is
no
land
remaining
upon
which
he
can
settle
and
that
he
must
perforce
fly
away
from
the
homestead
to
gather
him
means
elsewhere
at
any
rate
whether
this
be
true
or
false
the
martlet
certainly
is
never
represented
in
heraldry
with
feet
if
the
feet
are
shown
the
bird
becomes
a
swallow
most
heraldry
books
state
also
that
the
martlet
has
no
beak
how
such
an
idea
originated
i
am
at
a
loss
to
understand
because
i
have
never
yet
come
across
an
official
instance
in
which
the
martlet
is
so
depicted

confusion
between
the
foreign
merlette
which
is
drawn
like

the
martlet
may
account
for
the
idea
that
the
martlet
should
be
depicted
without

it
is
very
seldom
that
the

occurs

not

created

the

seldom
met
with
except
holding
a
stone
in
its
claw
the
term
for
which
stone
is
its
vigilance
a
curious
old
fable
which
explains
the
whole
matter
being
that
the
crane
held
the
stone
in
its
foot
so
that
if
by
any
chance
it
fell
asleep
the
stone
by
dropping
would
awaken
it

thus
act

fig
it
is
a
pity
that
the
truth
of
such
a
charming
example
of
the
old
world
should
be
dissipated
by
the
fact
that
the
crest
of
cranstoun
is
the
crane

rather
dormant
with
its
head
under
its
wing

nevertheless
holding

crane

not
often

the
curious
and
rather
perplexing
motto
thou
shalt
want

want
before
leaving
the

it
may
be
of
interest
to
observe
that
the
derivation
of
the
word
pedigree
is
from
de
the
appearance
of

the
branching

unique
inasmuch

possibly
the
fact
that

is
not

at

fighting

tournament
helmets
when

frequently
did
not
carry
the
actual

of
this

the

will
far
oftener
be
found
simply
adorned
with
a
plume
of
ostrich
feathers
than
with
a
heritable
crest
and
consequently
such
a
plume
has
remained
in
use
as
the
crest
of
a
very
large
number
of
families
this
point
is
however
more
fully
dealt
with
in
the
chapter
upon
crests
the
plume
of
ostrich
feathers
is
moreover
attributed
as
a
crest
to
a
far
greater
number
of
families
than
it
really
belongs
to
because
if
a
family
possessed
no
crest
the
helmet
was
generally
ornamented
with
a
plume
of
ostrich
feathers
which
later
generations
have
accepted
and
adopted
as
their
heritable
crest
when
it
never
possessed
such
a
character
a
notable
instance
of
this
will
be
found
in
the
crest
of
astley
as
given
in
the
peerage
books
the
number
of
feathers
in
a
plume
requires
to
be
stated
it
will
usually
be
found
to
be
three
five
or
seven
though
sometimes
a
larger
number
are
met
with
when
it
is
termed
a
double
plume
they
are
arranged
in
two
rows
the
one
issuing
above
the
other
and
a
triple
plume
is
arranged
in
three
rows
and
though
it
is
correct
to
speak
of
any
number
of
feathers
as
a
plume
it
will
usually
be
found
that
the
word
is
reserved
for
five
or
more
whilst
a
plume
of
three
feathers
would
more
frequently
be
termed
three
ostrich
feathers
whilst
they
are
usually
white
they
are
also
found
of
varied
colours
and
there
is
even
an
instance
to
be
met
with
of
ostrich
feathers
of
ermine
when
the
feathers
are
of
different
colours

need

be
carefully
blazoned

word

must

arrangement

others
then
follow
from

commencing
the
series
of
colours

any
other
arrangement
of
the
colours
occurs
it
must
be
specifically
detailed

plume
from

the

of

is

peculiar
about

character

has
evolved
one
use
of
the
peacock
feather

rather
for
the
eye
from
the
peacock
feather
which
happily
has
not
yet
reached
this
country
it
will
be
found
adorning
the
outer
edges
of
every
kind
of
object

it
even
occurs
on
occasion

a
kind
of
dorsal
fin
down

back
of
animals
bunches
of
cock

are
also
frequently
made
use

the
same
purpose
there
has
been
considerable
diversity
in
the
method
of
depicting
the
ostrich
feather
in
its
earliest
form
it
was
stiff
and
erect
as
if
cut
from
a
piece
of
board
fig
but
gradually
as
the
realistic
type
of
heraldic
art
came
into
vogue
it
was
represented
more
naturally
and
with
flowing
and
drooping
curves
of
later
years
however
we
have
followed
the
example
of
his
majesty
when
prince
of
wales
and
reverted
to
the
earlier
form
and
it
is
now
very
general
to
give
to
the
ostrich
feather
the
stiff
and
straight
appearance
which
it
originally
possessed
when
heraldically
depicted
occasionally
a
plume
of
ostrich
feathers
is
found
enclosed
in
a
case
that
is
wrapped
about
the
lower
part
as
if
it
were
a
bouquet
and
this
form
is
the
more
usual
in

plumes
are
constantly

colours

part

is
in

upon
water
or
merely
depicted
as
a
charge
upon
a
shield
a
fish
is
termed
hauriant
if
it
is
in
a
perpendicular
position
but
though
it
will
usually
be
represented
with
the
head
upwards
in
default
of
any
specific
direction
to
the
contrary
it
by
no
means
follows
that
this
is
always
the
case
and
it
is
more
correct
to
state
whether
the
head
is
upwards
or
downwards
a
practice
which
it
is
usually
found
will
be
conformed
to
when
the
charges
upon
a
shield
are
simply
blazoned
as
fish
no
particular
care
need
be
taken
to
represent
any
particular
variety
but
on
the
other
hand
it
is
not
in
such
cases
usual
to
add
any
distinctive
signs
by
which
a
charge
which
is
merely
a
fish
might
become
identified
as
any
particular
kind
of
fish
the
heraldic
representations
of
the
are
strangely
dissimilar
from
the
real
creature
and
also
show
amongst
themselves
a
wide
variety
and
latitude
it
is
early
found
in
heraldry
and
no
doubt
its
great
importance
in
that
science
is
derived
from
its
usage
by
the
dauphins
of
france
concerning
its
use
by
these
princes
there
are
all
sorts
of
curious
legends
told
the
most
usual
being
that
recited
by
berry
woodward
refers
to
this
legend
but
states
that
in
king
philip
of
france
the
domains
of
humbert
dauphin
de
viennois
and
further
remarks
that
the
legend
in
question
seems
to
be
without
solid
foundation
but
neither
woodward
nor
any
other
writer
seems
to
have
previously
suggested
what
is
doubtless
the
true
explanation
that
the
title
of
dauphin
and
the
province
of
viennois
were
a
separate
dignity
of
a
sovereign
character
to
which
were
attached
certain
territorial
and
sovereign
arms
or
a
dolphin
embowed
azure
finned
and
langued
gules
the
assumption
of
these
sovereign
arms
with
the
sovereignty
and
territory
to
which
they
belonged
was
as
much
a
matter
of
course
as
the
use
of
separate
arms
for
the
duchy
of
lancaster
by
his
present
majesty
king
edward
or
the
use
of
separate
arms
for
his
duchy
of
cornwall
by
the
prince
of
wales
berry
is
wrong
in
asserting
that
no

statement
he
is
clearly
incorrect
for
neither

his
statement
probably
originates
in
the
practice

in

the

of
artistic
decoration
at

added
all
sorts
of
fantastic

can
be
no

that

largely
consist

misreadings

misinterpretations

i
am
sorely
afraid
this

in
very
truth
the
real
origin
of
many
quaint
coats
of
arms
and
heraldic
terms
ancient
heraldic
writers
seem
to
have
amused
themselves
by
inventing
appropriate
arms
for
mythological
or
historical
personages
and
i
verily
believe
that
when
so
doing
they
never
intended
these
arms
to
stand
for
more
than
examples
of
their
own
wit
their
credulous
successors
incorporated
these
little
witticisms
in
the
rolls
of
arms
they
collected
and
one
can
only
hope
that
in
the
distant
future
the
charming
drawings
of
reed
which
in
recent
years
have
appeared
in
may
not
be
used
in
like
manner
there
are
but
few
instances
in
english
armory
in
which
the
or
is
met
with
in
fact
the
only
instance
which
one
can
recollect
is

to
a
family
of
botreaux
who
are
said
to
have
borne
argent
three
toads
erect
sable
i
am
confident
however
that
this
coat
of
arms
if
it
ever
existed
and
if
it
could
be
traced
to
its
earliest
sources
would
be
found
to
be
really

insects
the
insect
which
is
most
usually
met
with
in
heraldry
is
undoubtedly
the
being
considered
as
it
is
the
symbol
of
industry
small
wonder
that
it
has
been
so
frequently
adopted
it
is
usually
represented
as
if
displayed
upon
the
shield
and
it
is
then
termed
volant
though
of
course
the
real
term
which
will
sometimes
be
found
used
is
volant
fig
it
occurs
in
the
arms
of
dore
beatson
abercromby
samuel
and
sewell
either
as
a
charge
or
as
a
crest
its
use
however
as
a
crest
is
slightly
more
varied
inasmuch
as
it
is
found
walking
in
profile
and
with
its
wings
elevated
and
also
perched
upon
a
thistle
as
in
the
arms
of
ferguson
a
with
bees
diversely
volant
occurs
in
the
arms
of
rowe
and
the
popularity
of
the
bee
in
british
armory
is
doubtless
due
to
the
frequent
desire
to
perpetuate
the
fact
that
the
foundation
of
a
house
has
been
laid
by
business
industry
the
fact
that
the
bee
was
adopted
as
a
badge
by
the
emperor
napoleon
gave
it
considerable
importance
in
french
armory
inasmuch
as
he
assumed
it
for
his
own
badge
and
the
mantle
and
pavilion
around
the
armorial
bearings
of
the
empire
were
semé
of
these
insects
they
also
appeared
upon
his
own
coronation
mantle
he
adopted
them
under
the
impression
which
may
or
may
not
be
correct
that
they
had
at
one
time
been
the
badge
of
childeric
father
of
clovis
the
whole
story
connected
with
their
assumption
by
napoleon
has
been
a
matter
of
much
controversy
and
little
purpose
would
be
served
by
going
into
the
matter
here
but
it
may
be
added
that
napoleon
changed
the
upon
the
chief
in
the
arms
of
paris
to
golden
bees
upon
a
chief
of
gules
and
a
chief
azure

of
bees

was
added
as
indicative
of
their
rank

the

out

its

artistic
beauty
and
the
frequency
with
which
it
is
met
with

points
clearly
to
the
fact
that
there
is
some
allusion
behind

this
could
only
be
fathomed
many
a

might
adopt

one
would
not
expect
independent
choice
to
lead
so
many
to
pitch
upon
a
combination
of

cinquefoils
the
cross
crosslets
i
am
confident
are
a

addition

the

example
were
simply
argent

the
great
earl
of

coheir
of
the
former
earls

as
such
entitled

quarter
the
arms
of
the
de
bellomonts
as
stated
on
page
figs
and
there
are
two
coats
attributed
to
de
montfort
his
only
status
in
this
country
depended
solely
upon
the
de
bellomont
inheritance
and
conformably
with
the
custom
of
the
period
we
are
far
more
likely
to
find
him
using
arms
of
de
bellomont
or
de
beaumont
than
of
montfort
from
the
similarity
of
the
charge
to
the
beaumont
arms
i
am
inclined
to
think
the
lion
rampant
to
be
the
real
de
bellomont
coat
the
origin
of
the
cinquefoil
has
yet
to
be
accounted
for
the
earliest
de
bellomont
for
whom
i
can
find
proof
of
user
thereof
is
robert
otherwise
de
bellomont
who
died
in

whose
seal
fig
shows
it
be
it
noted
it
is
not

though
of

this
is
not
proof
in
any
way
it

in

my

it

nothing
more
than
a

his

his

being
pernelle

petronilla
the
heiress
of

the
cinquefoil
was
not
the
coat
of
grantmesnil

a
quaint
little
conceit

is
not
therefore
likely
to
have
been
used
as
a
coat
of
arms
by
the
de
bellomonts

no

they
used
it

to

who
speak

rather
seem
to
overlook
that
it

an
exact
reproduction
of
the
wild
rose

the
hedgerow

has
a
tendency
to
show
itself
displayed

not
in
the
more
profile
attitude
we
are
perhaps
accustomed
to

should
also
be
observed
that
the
earliest
representations
of
the
heraldic
rose
depict
the
intervening
spaces
between
the
petals
which
are
noticeable
in
the
wild
rose
under
the
tudor
sovereigns
the
heraldic
rose
often
shows
a
double
row
of
petals
a
fact
which
is
doubtless
accounted
for
by
the
then
increasing
familiarity
with
the
cultivated
variety

also
by
the

reason

its
assumption
as
a
national
badge
remains
largely
a
matter
of
mystery
though
it
is
of
nothing
like
so
ancient
an
origin
of
course
one
knows
the
and
wholly
impossible
legend
that
its
adoption
as
a
national
symbol
dates
from
the
battle
of
largs
when
one
of
the
danish
invaders
gave
away
an
attempted
surprise
by
his
cry
of
agony
caused
by
stepping
barefooted
upon
a
thistle
the
fact
however
remains
that
its
earliest
appearance
is
on
the
silver
coinage
of
in
the
reign
of
james
but
during
that
reign
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
was
accepted
either
as
a
national
badge
or
else
as
the
personal
badge
of
the
sovereign
the
period
in
question
was
that
in
which
badges
were
so
largely
used
and
it
is
not
unlikely
that
desiring
to
vie
with
his
brother
of
england
and
fired
by
the
example
of
the
broom
badge
and
the
rose
badge
the
scottish
king
remembering
the
ancient
legend
chose
the
thistle

his
own
badge

that

the

must

for
the
origin
of
the
heraldic
use
of

begin
with
the
form
of
the
as
a
mere
presumably
meaningless
form
of
decoration
is
found
long
before
the
days
of
armory
in
fact
from
the
earliest
period
of
decoration
it
is
such
an
essentially
natural
development
of
decoration
that
it
may
be
accepted
as
such
without
any
attempt
to
give
it
a
meaning
or
any
symbolism
its
earliest
heraldic
appearances
as
the
finial
of
a
sceptre
or
the
decoration
of
a
coronet
need
not
have
had
any
symbolical
character
we
then
find
the
lily
accepted
as
having
some
symbolical
reference
to
france
and
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
iris
was
known
by
the
name
of
a
lily
until
comparatively
modern
times
it
is
curious
though
possibly
in
this
case
it
may
be
only
a
coincidence
that
on
a
coin
of
the
emperor
hadrian
gaul
is
typified
by
a
female
figure
holding
in
the
hand
a
lily
the
legend
being
restutori
galliæ
the
as
the
finial
of
a
sceptre
and
as
an
ornament
of
a
crown
can
be
taken
back
to
the
fifth
century
upon
crowns
and
coronets
in
france
are
at
least
as
old
as
the
reign
of
king
robert
son
of
hugh
capet
whose
seal
represents
him
crowned
in
this
manner
we
have
moreover
the
ancient
legendary
tradition
that
at
the
baptism
of
clovis
king
of
the
franks
the
virgin
whose
emblem
the
lily
has
always
been
sent
a
lily
by
an
angel
as
a
mark
of
her
special
favour
it
is
difficult
to
determine
the
exact
date
at
which
this
tradition
was
invented
but
its
accepted
character
may
be
judged
from
the
fact
that
it
was
solemnly
advanced
by
the
french
bishops
at
the
council
of
trent
in
a
dispute
as
to
the
precedence
of
their
sovereign
the
old
legend
as
to
clovis
would
naturally
identify
the
flower
with
him
and
it
should
be
noted
that
the
names
clovis
lois
loys
and
louis
are
identical
loys
was
the
signature
of
the
kings
of
france
until
the
time
of
louis
xiii
it
is
worth
the
passing
conjecture
that
what
are
sometimes
termed
cleves
lilies
may
be
a
corrupted
form
of
clovis
lilies
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
term
is
quite
as
likely
to
be
a
corruption
of
as
flower
of
the
lily
the
chief
point
is
that
the
desire
was
to
represent
a
in
allusion
to
the
old
legend
without
perhaps
any
very
definite
certainty
of
the
flower

to
be
represented

led
to
all

at

the

the
term
seeded
and
remarks
of
it
this
being
one
of
the
numerous
instances
of
pedantic
because
unnecessary
distinction
which
showed
marks
of
decadence
for
both
forms
occur
at
the
same
period
and
adorn
the
same
object
evidently
with
the
same
intention
the
difference
between
these
forms
really
is
that
the

seeded
when
a
stalk
having
seeds
at
the

issues
in

from
the
designs
of
the
which
there
appear
one
can
not
leave
the
without
referring
to
one
curious
development
of
it
viz
the
leopard
face
fig
a
curious
charge
which
undoubtedly
originated
in
the
arms
of
the
family
of
cantelupe
this
charge
is
not
uncommon
though
by
no
means
so
usual
as
the
leopard
face
planché
considers
that
it
was
originally
derived
from
the
the
circular
boss
which
in
early
representations
so
often
figures
as
the
centre
of
the
being
merely
with
the
leopard
face
one
can
follow
planché
a
bit
further
by
imagining
that
this
face
need
not
necessarily
be
that
of
a
leopard
for
at
a
certain
period
all
decorative
art
was
crowded
with
grotesque
masks
whenever
opportunity
offered
the
leopard
face
is
now
represented
as
a
leopard
face
with
the
lower
part
of
a
issuing
from
the
mouth
and
the
upper
part
rising
from
behind
the
head
instances
of
this
charge
occur
as
early
as
the
thirteenth
century
as
the
arms
of
the
cantelupe
family
and
thomas
de
cantelupe
having
been
bishop
of
hereford
to
the
arms
of
that
see
have
since
been
three
leopards
faces
the
distinction
being
that
in
the
arms
of
the
see
of
hereford
the
leopards
faces
are
reversed
the
origin
may
perhaps
make
itself
apparent
when
we
remember
that
the
earliest
form
of
the
name
was
cantelowe
is
it
not
probable
that
lions
faces
head
may
have
been
suggested
by
the
name
possibly
however
may
have
been
meant

a
very
interesting
origin
has
been
suggested
by
taunton
in
his
work
the
tauntons
of
oxford
by
one
of
them
i
merely
wish
to
make
a
few
remarks
of
my
own
that
seem
to
have
escaped
other
writers
on
genealogical
matters
in
the
first
place
sir
gilbert
le
grosvenor
who
is
stated
to
have
come
over
with
william
of
normandy
at
the
conquest
is
described
as
nephew
to
hugh
lupus
earl
of
chester
but
hugh
lupus
was
himself
nephew
to
king
william
now
william
could
not
have
been
very
old
when
he
overthrew
harold
at
hastings
it
seems
therefore
rather
improbable
that
sir
gilbert
le
grosvenor
who
was
his
nephew
nephew
could
actually
have
fought
with
him
at
hastings
especially
when
william
lived
to
reign
for
years
after
and
was
not
very
old
when
he
died
the
name
grosvenor
does
not
occur
in
any
of
the
versions
of
the
roll
of
battle
abbey
not
that
any
of
these
versions
of
this
celebrated
roll
are
considered
authentic
by
modern
critics
who
say
that
many
names
were
subsequently
added
by
the
monks
to
please
ambitious
parvenus
the
name
venour
is
on
the
roll
however
and
it
is
just
possible
that
this
venour
was
the
grosvenor
of
our
quest
the
addition
of
would
then
be
subsequent
to
his
fattening
on
the
spoils
of
the
saxon
and
cultivating
a
corporation
means
hunter
and
means
fat
uncle
hugh
lupus
was
we
know
a
fat
man
in
fact
he
was
nicknamed
the
fat
the
grosvenors
of
that
period
probably
inherited
obesity
from
their
relative
hugh
lupus
therefore
and
the
fable
that
they
were
called
grosvenor
on
account
of
their
office
of
huntsman
to
the
dukes
of
normandy
is
not
to
be
relied
on
we
are
further
on
told
by
the
old
family
historians
that
when
sir
robert
grosvenor
lost
the
day
in
that
controversy
with
sir
richard
le
scrope
baron
of
bolton
concerning
the
coat
of
arms
a
bend
or
borne
by
both
families
sir
robert
grosvenor
took
for
his
arms
one
of
the
garbs
of
his
kinsman
the
earl
of
chester
it
did
not
seem
to
occur
to
these
worthies
that
the
earl
of
chester
who
was
their
ancestor
uncle
never
bore
the
garbs
in
his
arms
but
a
head
it
is
true
that
one
or
two
subsequent
earls
of
chester
bore
garbs
but
these
earls
were
far
too
distantly
connected
with
the
grosvenors
to
render
it
likely
that
the
latter
would
borrow
their
new
arms
from
this
source
it
is
curious
that
there
should
have
been
in
this
same
county
of
chester
a
family
of
almost
identical
name
also
bearing
a
garb
in
their
arms
though
their
garb
was
surrounded
by
three
bezants
the
name
of
this
family
was
grasvenor
or
gravenor
and
moreover
the
tinctures
of
their
arms
were
identical
with
those
of
grosvenor
it
is
far
more
likely
therefore
that
the
coat
assumed
by
sir
robert
after
the
adverse
decision
of
the
court
of
chivalry
was
taken
from
that
of
grasvenor
or
gravenor
and
that
the
two
families
were
known
at
that
time
to
be
of
common
origin
although
their
connection
with
each
other
has
subsequently
been
lost
in
french
both
and
mean
fat
and
we
have
both
forms
in
grosvenor
and
grasvenor
a
chief
huntsman
to
royalty
would
have
been
grandvenor
not
grosvenor
or
grasvenor
all
these
criticisms
of
mine
however
only
affect
the
origin
of
the
arms
and
not
the
ancient
and
almost
royal
descent
of
this
illustrious
race
hugh
lupus
earl
of
chester
was
a
son
of
the
duke
of
brittany
as
is
plainly
stated
in
his
epitaph
this
connection
of
uncle
and
nephew
then
between
the
fat
and
gilbert
grosvenor
implies
a
maternal
descent
from
the
dukes
of
brittany
for
the
first
ancestor
of
the
grosvenor
family
in
virtue
of
their
descent
from
an
heiress
of
the
house
of
grosvenor
it
is
only
necessary
to
add
the
tauntons
of
oxford
are
grosvenors
heraldically
speaking
and
that
quartering
so
many
ancient
coats
through
the
tanners
and
the
grosvenors
with
our
grant
is
like
putting
old
wine
into
new
bottles
hugh
lupus
left
no
son
to
succeed
him
and
the
subsequent
descent
of
the
earldom
of
chester
was
somewhat
erratic
so
i
think
there
is
some
point
in
my
arguments
regarding
the
coat
assumed
by
sir
robert
grosvenor
of
hulme
though
a
garb
unless
quoted
otherwise
is
presumed
to
be
a
sheaf
of
wheat
the
term
is
not
so
confined
the
garbs
in
the
arms
of
comyn
which
figure
as
a
quartering
in
so
many
scottish
coats
are
really
of
cummin
as
presumably
are
the
garbs
in
the
arms
of
cummins
when
a
garb
is
banded
of
a
different
colour
this
should
be
stated
and
elvin
states
that
it
may
be
eared
of
a
different
colour
though
i
confess
i
am
aware
of
no
such
instance
argent
two
bundles
of
reeds
in
fess
vert

the
coat
of
janssen
of
wimbledon
surrey

a

use

is
fairly
frequent

be
added

authority

such

to
be

there
has
owing
to
their

been
much
confusion

the
difficulty

increased
by
the
fact
that
no

have

stars
under
that
name
are
practically
unknown
when
the

are
wavy
the
charge
is
termed
an
estoile
but
when
they
are
straight
the
term
mullet
is
used
that
being
so
these
rules
follow
that
the
estoile
is
never
pierced

from
the
accepted
method

this
would
hardly

very
feasible

that
unless

six

other
numbers
are
quite
permissible

the

an

but
the
arms

not
of
any
authority
everything
with
straight

in
england
a
mullet
it
naturally
follows
that
the
english
practice
permits
a
mullet
to
be
plain

pierced

mullets
are
occasionally
met
with
pierced
of
a
colour
other
than
the
field
they
are
charged
upon
according
to
the
english
practice
therefore
the
mullet
is
not
represented
as
pierced
unless
it
is
expressly
stated
to
be
so
the
mullet
both
in
england
and
scotland
is
of
five

a
greater

are

mullets
pierced

the
scottish

it

be
admitted

it

more
correct
than
the
english

more

their

in

a

a

it

the

it
certainly
could
not
exist

fact
unpierced
nevertheless
it
is
by
no
means
stringently
adhered
to
in
that
country
and
they
make
confusion
worse
confounded

the
frequent
use
of

additional

foreign
long
before
the
days
of

some
form
of
decoration
for
the
head
to
indicate
rank
and
power
had
been
in
vogue
amongst
it
is
hardly
too
much
to
say
all
nations
on
the
earth
as
in
most
things
western
nations
have
borrowed
both
ideas
and
added
developments
of
those
ideas
from
the
east
and
in
traversing
the
range
of
armory
where
crowns
and
coronets
appear
in
modern
western
heraldry
we
find
a
large
proportion
of
these
devices
are
studiously
and
of
purpose
delineated
as
being
with
crowns
and
coronets
as
symbols
of
rank

am
not
now
of
course
concerned
but
only
with
those
cases
which
may
be
cited
as
supplying
examples
where
the
different
kinds
of
crowns
appear
either
as
charges
on
shields
or
as
forming
parts
of
crests

in
heraldry
may
be
differentiated
under
the
royal
or
the
imperial

with

abraham

of

roberts
in

of
antiquity
one
may
best
perhaps
at
the
outset
allude
to
the
arms
borne
by
the
seaport
towns
of
boston
and
of
or
hull
as
the
town
is
usually
called
inasmuch
as
a
tradition
has
it
that
the
three
crowns
which
figure
on
the
shield
of
each
of
these
towns
originate
from
a
recognised
device
of
merchantmen
who
travelling
in
and
trading
with
the
east
and
likening
themselves
to
the
magi
in
their
bethlehem
visit
adopted
these
crowns
as
the
device
or
badge
of
their
business
the
same
remarks
may
apply
to
the
arms
of
cologne
argent
on
a
chief
gules
three
crowns
or
from
this
fact
if
the
tradition
be
one
to
the
adoption
of
the
same
device
by
the
towns
to
which
these
merchants
traded
is
not
a
far
step
one
may
notice
in
passing
that
unlike
what
from
the
legend
one
would
expect
these
crowns
are
not
of
eastern
design
but
of
a
class
wholly
connected
with
heraldry
itself
the
legend
and
device
however
are
both
much
older

chapter
xx
the
heraldic
helmet
since
one
earliest
lessons
in
the
rules
of
heraldry
we
have
been
taught
as
one
of
the
fundamental
laws
of
the
achievement
that
the
helmet
by
its
shape
and
position
is
indicative
of
rank
and
we
early
learnt
by
rote
that
the
esquire
helmet
was
of
steel
and
was
placed
in
profile
with
the
visor
closed
the
helmet
of
the
knight
and
baronet
was
to
be
open
and
affronté
that
the
helmet
of
the
peer
must
be
of
silver
guarded
by
grilles
and
placed
in
profile
and
that
the
royal
helmet
was
of
gold
with
grilles
and
affronté
until
recent
years
certain
stereotyped
forms
of
the
helmet
for
these
varying
circumstances
were
in
use
hideous
alike
both
in
the
regularity
of
their
usage
and
the
atrocious
shapes
into
which
they
had
been
evolved
these
regulations
like
some
other
adjuncts
of
heraldic
art
are
comparatively
speaking
of
modern
origin
heraldry
in
its
earlier
and
better
days
knew
them
not
and
they
came
into
vogue
about
the
stuart
times
when
heraldic
art
was
distinctly
on
the
wane
it
is
puzzling
to
conceive
a
desire
to
stereotype
these
particular
forms
and
we
take
it
that
the
fact
which
is
undoubted
arose
from
the
lack
of
heraldic
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
artists
who
having
one
form
before
them
which
they
were
assured
was
correct
under
the
circumstances
simply
reproduced
this
particular
form
in
facsimile
time
after
time
not
knowing
how
far
they
might
deviate
and
still
remain
correct
the
knowledge
of
heraldry
by
the
heraldic
artist
was
the
real
point
underlying
the
excellence
of
mediæval
heraldic
art
and
underlying
the
excellence
of
much
of
the
heraldic
art
in
the
revival
of
the
last
few
years
as
it
has
been
often
pointed
out
in
olden
times
they
played
with
heraldry
and
therein
lay
the
excellence
of
that
period
the
old
men
knew
the
lines
within
which
they
could
play
and
knew
the
laws
which
they
could
not
transgress
their
successors
ignorant
of
the
laws
of
arms
and
afraid
of
the
hidden
meanings
of
armory
had
none
but
the
stereotyped
lines
to
follow
the
result
was
bad
let
us
first
consider
the
development
of
the
actual
helmet
and
then
its
application
to
heraldic
purposes
will
be
more
readily
followed

to
the
modern
mind
which
grumbles
at
the
weight
of
head
coverings
it
is
often
a
matter
of
great
wonder
how
the
knights
of
ancient
days
managed
to
put
up
with
the
heavy
weight
of
the
great
iron
helmet
with
its
wooden
or
leather
crest
a
careful
study
of
ancient
descriptions
of
tournaments
and
warfare
will
supply
the
clue
to
the
explanation
which
is
simply
that
the
helmet
was
very
seldom
worn
for
ceremonial
purposes
and
occasions
it
was
carried
by
a
page
and
in
actual
use
it
was
carried
slung
at
the
until
the
last
moment
when
it
was
donned
for
action
as
blows
and
close
contact
became
imminent
then
by
the
nature
of
its
construction
the
weight
was
carried
by
the
shoulders
the
head
and
neck
moving
freely
within
necessary
limits
inside
all
this
will
be
more
readily
apparent
when
the
helmet
itself
is
considered
our
ideas
of
helmets
their
shape
their
size
and
their
proportions
are
largely
taken
from
the
specimens
manufactured
not
necessarily
in
modern
times
for
ceremonial
purposes
for
exhibition
as
insignia
of
knighthood
by
far
the
larger
proportion
of
the
genuine
helmets
now
to
be
seen
were
purposely
made
certainly
at
remote
dates
not
for
actual
use
in
battle
or
tournament
but
for
ceremonial
use
chiefly
at
funerals
few
indeed
are
the
examples
still
existing
of
helmets
which
have
been
actually
used
in
battle
or
tournament
why
there
are
so
few
remaining
to
us
when
every
person
of
position
must
necessarily
have
possessed
one
throughout
the
plantagenet
period
and
probably
at
any
rate
to
the
end
of
the
reign
of
henry
is
a
mystery
which
has
puzzled
many
people
for
helmets
are
not
like
glass
and
china
subject
to
the
vicissitudes
of
breakage
the
reason
is
doubtless
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
at
that
period
they
were
so
general
and
so
little
out
of
the
common
that
they
possessed
no
greater
value
than
any
other
article
of
clothing
and
whilst
the
real
helmet
lacking
a
ceremonial
value
was
not
preserved
the
sham
ceremonial
helmet
of
a
later
period
possessing
none
but
a
ceremonial
value
was
preserved
from
ceremonial
to
ceremonial
and
has
been
passed
on
to
the
present
day
but
a
glance
at
so
many
of
these
helmets
which
exist
will
plainly
show
that
it
was
quite
impossible
for
any
man
head
to
have
gone
inside
them
and
the
sculptured
helmets
of
what
may
seem
to
us
uncouth
shape
and
exaggerated
size
which
are
occasionally
to
be
found
as
part
of
a
monumental
effigy
are
the
size
and
shape
of
the
helmets
that
were
worn
in
battle
this
accounts
for
the
much
helmets
in
proportion
to
the
size
of
shield
which
will
be
found
in
heraldic
emblazonments
of
the
plantagenet
and
tudor
periods
the
artists
of
those
periods
were
accustomed
to
the
sight
of
real
helmets
and
knew
and
drew
the
real
proportion
which
existed
between
the
fighting
helmet
and
the
fighting
shield
artists
of
stuart
and
georgian
days
knew
only
the
ceremonial
helmet
and
consequently
adopted
and
stereotyped
its
impossible
shape
and
equally
impossible
size
victorian
heraldic
artists
ignorant
alike
of
the
actual
and
the
ceremonial
reduced
the
size
even
further
and
until
the
recent
revulsion
in
heraldic
art
with
its
reversion
to
older
types
and
its
copying
of
older
examples
the
helmets
of
heraldry
had
reached
the
uttermost
limits
of
absurdity
the
recent
revival
of
heraldry
is
due
to
men
with
accurate
and
extensive
knowledge
and
many
recent
examples
of
heraldic
art
well
compare
with
ancient
types
one
happy
result
of
this
revival
is
a
return
to
older
and
better
types
of
the
helmet
but
it
is
little
use
discarding
the
heraldic
helmet
of
the
stationer
shop
unless
a
better
and
more
accurate
result
can
be
shown
so
that
it
will
be
well
to
trace
in
detail

well
protected

the

continued

it
merged
into

supplanted
by
the

afterwards
pointed

several
different

was
used
for
combats

had
an
almost
spherical

came
right
down
to
the
cuirass

it
was
firmly
fixed

all
large

about

enclosed
the

round
the

had
a
roundel

disc
to
protect
the

an

is
a
nearer
approach

the

pivot
which

the

also
serves
as
a
hinge
for

the

the

perhaps
the

country
to
fall
from
grace
in
the
matter

the

the
buckled
helmet
is
found
with
the
arms
of
the
lower
briefadels
those
ennobled
by
patent
and
the
practice
continued
despite
the
violent
protests
of
the
tournament
families
who
considered
their
prerogative
had
been
infringed
the
closed
helmet
consequently
sank
gradually
in
germany
to
the
grade
of
a
mere
burgess
helmet
and
as
such
became
of
little
account
although
in
former
times
it
had
been
borne
by
the
proudest
houses
similarly
in
france
the
buckled
helmet
was
considered
to
be
reserved
for
the
military
noblesse
and
newly
ennobled
families
were
denied
its
use
until
the
third
generation
when
they
became
woodward
states
that
when
in
charles
conferred
on
the
bourgeoisie
of
paris
the
right
to
use
armorial
bearings
it
was
strenuously
denied
that
they
could
use
the
timbred
helm
in
an
edict
of
charles
ix
prohibited
the
use
of
to
any
who
were
not
noble
by
birth
the
grilles
of
the
helmet
produced
with
the
old
french
heralds
the
opportunity
of
a
minutiæ
of
rule
which
considering
the
multitude
of
rules
fathered
rightly
or
wrongly
upon
british
heraldry
we
may
be
devoutly
happy
never
reached
our
shores
they
assigned
different
numbers
of
grilles
to
different
ranks
but
as
the
writers
differ
as
to
the
varying
numbers
it
is
probable
that
such
rules
were
never
officially
accepted
even
in
that
country
in
france
the
rule
was
much
as
in

as
to
its
heraldic
use
was
raging
in

present
rules
concerning
helmets
which
hold
in

britain
are
that
the
helmet
of
the
sovereign
and
the
royal
princes
of
this
country
shall
be
of
gold
placed
in
an
affronté
position
and
shall
have

the
helmet
of
a
peer
shall
be
of
silver
shall
be
placed
in

and
shall
have
golden
grilles

stated
to
be
five
in
number
a
detail
not
stringently
adhered
to
the
helmet
of
a
knight
or
baronet
shall
be
of
steel
placed
and
shall
be
open
whilst
the
helmet
of
an
esquire
or
gentleman
shall
be
of
steel
and
in
profile
with
the
visor
closed
within
these
limits
considerable
latitude
is
allowed
and
even
in
official
grants
of
arms
which
as
far
as
emblazonment
goes
are
very
much
of
a
stereotyped
style
actual
unvarying
adherence
to
a
particular
pattern
is
not
insisted
upon
the
earliest
instance
amongst
the
garter
plates
in
which
a
helmet
with
grilles
is
used
to
denote
the
rank
of
a
peer
is
the
stall
plate
of
lord
knollys
in
in
the
visitations
but
few
instances
can
be
found
in
which
the
arms
of
peers
are
included
peers
were
not
compelled
to
attend
and
enter
their
arms
and
pedigrees
at
visitations
doubtless
owing
to
the
fact
that
no
garter
king
of
arms
ever
made
a
visitation
whilst
it
has
been
the
prerogative
of
garter
to
deal
with
peers
and
their
arms
by
himself
at
the
same
time
however
there
are
some
number
of
instances
of
peers
arms
and
pedigrees
in
the
visitation
books
several
occurring
in
the
visitation
of
yorkshire
in
these
cases
the
arms
of
peers
are
set
out
with
supporters
and
mottoes
but
there
is
no
difference
between
their
helmets
and
what
we
should
now
term
the
helmet
of
an
esquire
or
gentleman
this
is
all
the
more
curious
because
neither
helmet
nor
motto
is
found
in
the
tricks
given
of
the
arms
of
commoners
consequently
one
may
with
certainty
date
the
introduction
of
the
helmet
with
grilles
as
the
distinguishing
mark
of
a
peer
in
this
country
between
the
years
and
the
introduction
of
the
open
helmet
as
indicative
of
knight
or
baronet
is
known
to
date
from
about
the
period
of
the
restoration
whilst
these
fixed
rules
as
to
helmets
are
still
scrupulously
adhered
to
by
english
heralds
lyon
king
of
arms
would
seem
to
be
inclined
to
let
them
quietly
lapse
into
desuetude
and
the
emblazonment
of
the
arms
of
sir
george
in
the
lyon
register
at
the
recent
rematriculation
of
his
arms
affords
an
instance
in
which
the
rules
have
been
ignored
some
of
the
objections
one
hears
raised
to
official
heraldry
will
not
hold
water
when
all
facts
are
known
but
one
certainly
thinks
that
those
who
object
to
the
present
helmet
and
its
methods
of
usage
have
ample
reason
for
such
remarks
as
one
frequently
sees
in
print
upon
the
subject
to
put
it
mildly
it
is
absolutely
ridiculous
to
see
a
helmet
placed
affronté
and
a
lion
passant
looking
out
over
the
side
of
it
or
to
see
a
helmet
in
profile
with
the
crest
of
a
man
head
affronté
placed
above
it
and
as
a
consequence
also
peeping
over
the
side
the
necessity
for
providing
a
for
the
crest
other
than
unoccupied
space
has
also
led
to
the
ridiculous
practice
of
depicting
the
wreath
or
torse
in
the
form
of
a
straight
bar
balanced
upon
the
apex
of
the
helmet
the
rule
itself
as
to
the
positions
of
helmets
for
the
varying
ranks
is
officially
recognised
and
the
elaboration
of
the
rule
with
regard
to
the
differing
metals
of
the
royal
helmet
and
the
helmets
of
peers
and
knights
and
baronets
is
officially
followed
though
the
supposed
regulation
which
requires
that
the
helmet
of
an
esquire
or
gentleman
shall
be
of
steel
alone
is
not
inasmuch
as
the
helmet
painted
upon
a
grant
is
ornamented
with
gold
these
rules
in
england
only
date
from
the
times
of
the
stuarts
and
they
can
not
be
said
to
be
advantageous
from
any
point
of
view
they
are
certainly
distinctly
harmful
from
the
artistic
standpoint
it
is
plainly
utterly
impossible
to
depict
some
crests
upon
a
profile
helmet
and
equally
impossible
to
display
others
upon
an
affronté
helmet
in
scotland
the
crests
do
not
afford
quite
such
a
regular
succession
of
glaring
examples
for
ridicule
as
is
the
case
in
england
no
need
is
recognised
in
scotland
for
necessarily
distinguishing
the
crest
of
one
family
from
that
of
another
though
proper
differences
are
rigidly
adhered
to
with
regard
to
the
coats
of
arms
nevertheless
scotland
provides
us
with
many
crests
which
it
is
utterly
impossible
to
actually
carry
on
an
actual
helmet
and
examples
of
this
kind
can
be
found
in
the
rainbow
which
floats
above
the
broken
globe
of
the
hopes
and
the
coronets
in

to
which
the
hand
points

the
crest
of
the
family
of

boath
with

other
similar
absurdities
in
england
an
equal
necessity
for
difference
is
insisted
upon
in
the
crest
as
is
everywhere
insisted
upon
with
regard
to
the
coat
of
arms
and
in
the
time
of
the
late
garter
king
of
arms
it
was
rapidly
becoming
almost
impossible
to
obtain
a
new
crest
which
has
not
got
a
row
of
small
objects
in
front
of
it
or
else
two
somethings
one
on
either
side
things
however
have
now
considerably
improved
if
a
crest
is
to
be
depicted
between
two
ostrich
feathers
for
example
it
stands
to
reason
that
the
central
object
should
be
placed
upon
the
centre
of
the
helmet
whilst
the
ostrich
feathers
would
be
one
on
either
side
that
is
placed
in
a
position
slightly
above
the
ears
yet
if
a
helmet
is
to
be
rigidly
depicted
in
profile
with
such
a
crest
it
is
by
no
means
inconceivable
that
the
one
ostrich
feather
at
the
one
side
would
hide
both
the
other
ostrich
feather
and
the
central
object
leaving
the
crest
to
appear
when
properly
depicted
for
example
if
photographed
from
a
profile
view
of
an
actual
helmet
as
a
single
ostrich
feather
take
for
instance
the
sievier
crest
which
is
an
estoile
between
two
ostrich
feathers
if
that
crest
were
properly
depicted
upon
a
profile
helmet
the
one
ostrich
feather
would
undoubtedly
hide
everything
else
for
it
is
hardly
likely
that
the
estoile
would
be
placed
upon
an
actual
helmet
and
to
properly
display
it
it
ought
to
take
its
place
upon
an
affronté
helmet
under
the
present
rules
it
would
be
officially
depicted
with
the
estoile
facing
the
side
one
ostrich
feather
in
front
over
the
nose
and
the
other
at
the
back
of
the
head
which
of
course
reduces
it
to
an
absurdity
to
take
another
example
one
might
instance
the
crest
of
sir
william
crookes
it
is
hardly
to
be
supposed
that
a
helmet
would
ever
have
been
borne
into
a
tournament
surmounted
by
an
elephant
looking
out
over
the
side
it
would
most
certainly
have
had
its
head
placed
to
the
front
and
yet
because
sir
william
crookes
is
a
knight
he
is
required
to
use
an
affronté
helmet
with
a
crest
which
most
palpably
was
designed
for
use
in
profile
the
absurd
position
which
has
resulted
is
chiefly
due
to
the
position
rules
and
largely
a
consequence
of
the
hideous
british
practice
for
no
other
nation
has
ever
adopted
it
of
depicting
as
is
so
often
done
a
coat
of
arms
and
crest
without
the
intervening
helmet
and
mantling
though
perhaps
another
cause
may
have
had
its
influence
i
allude
to
the
fact
that
an
head
for
example
in
profile
is
considered
quite
a
different
crest
to
the
same
animal
head
when
placed
affronté
and
so
long
as
this
idea
holds
and
so
long
as
the
rules
concerning
the
position
of
the
helmet
exist
for
so
long
shall
we
have
these
glaring
and
ridiculous
anomalies
and
whilst
one
generation
of
a
family
has
an
affronté
helmet
and
another
using
the
same
crest
may
have
a
profile
one
it
is
useless
to
design
crests
specifically
to
fit
the
one
or
the
other
eve
who
is
certainly
one
of
the
most
accomplished
heraldic
artists
of
the
present
time
has
adopted
a
plan
in
his
work
which
whilst
conforming
with
the
rules
to
which
i
have
referred
has
reduced
the
peculiarities
resulting
from
their
observance
to
a
minimum
his
plan
is
simple
inasmuch
as
with
a
crest
which
is
plainly
affronté
and
has
to
be
depicted
upon
a
profile
helmet
he
slightly
alters
the
perspective
of
each
twisting
round
the
helmet
which
whilst
remaining
slightly
in
profile
more
nearly
approaches
the
affronté
position
and
bringing
the
crest
slightly
round
to
meet
it
in
this
way
he
has
obtained
some
very
good
results
from
awkward
predicaments
joseph
foster
in
his
peerage
and
baronetage
absolutely
discarded
all
rules
affecting
the
position
of
the
helmet
and
though
the
artistic
results
may
be
excellent
his
plan
can
not
be
commended
because
whilst
rules
exist
they
ought
to
be
adhered
to
at
the
same
time
it
must
be
frankly
admitted
that
the
laws
of
position
seem
utterly
unnecessary
no
other
country
has
them
they
are
as
has
been
shown
impracticable
from
the
artistic
standpoint
and
there
can
be
very
little
doubt
that
it
is
highly
desirable
that
they
should
be
wholly
abolished
it
is
quite
proper
that
there
should
be
some
means
of
distinction
and
it
would
seem
well
that
the
helmet
with
grilles
should
be
reserved
for
peers
in
this
we
should
be
following
or
closely
approximating
to
the
rules
observed
formerly
upon
the
continent
and
if
all
questions
of
position
are
waived
the
only
difficulty
which
remains
is
the
helmet
of
baronets
and
knights
the
open
helmet
is
ugly
in
the
extreme
anything
would
be
preferable
except
an
open
helmet
in
profile
and
probably
it
would
be
better
to
wipe
out
the
rule
on
this
point
as
well
knights
of
any
order
have
the
circle
of
that
order
within
which
to
place
their
shields
and
baronets
have
the
augmentations
of
their
rank
and
degree
the
knight
bachelor
would
be
the
only
one
to
suffer
the
gift
of
a
plain
circlet
around
the
shield
or
following
the
precedent
of
a
baronet
a
spur
upon
a
canton
or
inescutcheon
could
easily
remove
any
cause
of
complaint
but
whilst
one
may
think
it
well
to
urge
strongly
the
alteration
of
existing
rules
it
should
not
be
considered
permissible
to
ignore
rules
which
undoubtedly
do
exist
whilst
those
rules
remain
in
force
the
helmets
of
knights
and
baronets
and
of
esquires
and
gentlemen
in
accordance
with
present
official
practice
are
usually
ornamented
with
gold
though
this
would
not
appear
to
be
a
fixed
and
unalterable
rule
when
two
or
more
crests
need
to
be
depicted
various
expedients
are
adopted
the
english
official
practice
is
to
paint
one
helmet
only
and
both
the
crests
are
detached
from
it
the
same
plan
was
formerly
adopted
in
scotland
the
dexter
crest
is
naturally
the
more
important
and
the
principal
one
in
each
case
by
using
one
helmet
only
the
necessity
of
turning
the
dexter
crest
to
face
the
sinister
is
obviated
the
present
official
method
adopted
in
england
of
depicting
three
crests
is
to
use
one
helmet
only
and
all
three
crests
face
to
the
dexter
the
centre
one
which
is
placed
on
the
helmet
is
the
principal
or
first
crest
that
on
the
dexter
side
the
second
and
the
one
on
the
sinister
the
third
in
germany
the
land
of
many
crests
no
less
than
thirteen
were
borne
above
the
shield
of
the
margraves
of
there
has
from
the
earliest
times
been
a
fixed
invariable
practice
of
never
dissociating
a
crest
from
the
helmet
which
supported
it
and
consequently
one
helmet
to
every
crest
has
long
been
the
only
recognised
procedure
in
the
united
kingdom
duplication
of
crests
is
quite
a
modern
practice
amongst
the
plantagenet
garter
plates
there
is
not
a
single
example
to
be
found
of
a
coat
of
arms
with
more
than
a
single
crest
and
there
is
no
ancient
british
example
of
more
than
one
helmet
which
can
be
referred
to
for
guidance
the
custom
originated
in
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
in
germany
this
point
is
more
fully
dealt
with
in
the
chapter
devoted
to
the
consideration
of
crests
but
it
may
be
here
noted
that
in
austria
a
knight
may
place
two
and
a
baron
three
helmets
over
his
shield
the
continental
practice
is
as
follows
when
the
number
of
the
helms
is
even
they
are
arranged
so
that
all
look
inwards
towards
the
centre
line
of
the
escutcheon
half
being
turned
to
the
dexter
half
to
the
sinister
if
the
number
be
uneven
the
principal
helm
is
placed
in
the
centre
affronté
the
others
with
their
crests
being
turned
towards
it
thus
some
face
to
the
dexter
some
to
the
sinister
the
crests
are
always
turned
with
the
helmets
in
scandinavia
the
centre
helm
is
affronté
the
others
with
their
crests
are
often
turned
outwards
english
officialism
whilst
confining
its
own
emblazonments
to
one
helmet
only
has
never
sought
to
assert
that
the
use
of
two
or
more
was
either
incorrect
or
faulty
heraldry
and
particularly
in
these
later
days
of
the
revival
of
heraldic
art
in
this
country
all
heraldic
artists
following
the
german
example
are
inclined
to
give
each
crest
its
own
helmet
this
practice
has
been
adopted
during
the
last
few
years
by
lyon
king
of
arms
and
now
all
paintings
of
arms
in
lyon
register
which
have
two
crests
have
the
same
number
of
helmets
some
of
the
bath
stall
plates
in
henry
vii
chapel
in
westminster
abbey
also
display
two
helmets
when
two
helmets
are
used
it
has
been
customary
still
following
the
german
model
to
turn
them
to
face
each
other
except
in
the
cases
of
the
helmets
of
a
knight
or
baronet
and
with
the
same
exception
when
three
helmets
have
been
employed
the
outer
ones
have
been
placed
to
face
the
centre
whilst
the
centre
one
has
been
placed
in
profile
as
would
be
the
case
were
it
standing
alone
but
the
multiplication
of
english
crests
in
number
all
of
which
as
granted
are
required
to
differ
has
naturally
resulted
in
the
stereotyping
of
points
of
difference
in
attitude
and
the
inevitable
consequence
is
unfortunately
that
without
sacrificing
this
character
of
differentiation
it
is
impossible
to
allow
the
english
heraldic
artist
the
same
latitude
and
freedom
of
disposition
with
regard
to
crests
that
his
german
confrère
enjoys
these
remarks
apply
solely
to
english
and
irish
crests
for
scottish
practices
requiring
no
differentiation
in
the
crests
have
left
scottish
crests
simple
and
unspoiled
in
england
the
result
is
that
to
play
with
the
position
of
a
crest
frequently
results
in
an
entire
alteration
of
its
character
and
consequently
as
there
is
nothing
whatever
in
the
nature
of
a
law
or
of
a
rule
to
the
contrary
it
is
quite
as
usual
to
now
find
that
two
profile
helmets
are
both
placed
to
face
the
dexter
as
placed
to
face
each
other
another
point
seems
also
in
england
to
have
been
lost
sight
of
in
borrowing
our
methods
from
germany
they
hold
themselves
at
liberty
to
and
usually
make
all
their
on
the
face
to
the
centre
this
is
never
done
in
england
where
all
face
to
the
dexter
it
seems
therefore
to
me
an
anomaly
to
apply
one
rule
to
the
shield
and
another
to
the
helmet
and
personally
i
prefer
that
both
helmets
and
all
charges
should
face
the
dexter
in
british
heraldry
and
in
fact
the
rule
is
universal
no
woman
other
than
a
reigning
sovereign
is
permitted
to
surmount
her
arms
by
a
helmet
woodward
states
that
many
writers
have
denied
the
right
of
ecclesiastics
and
of
course
of
women
to
the
use
of
helmet
and
crest
spener
the
great
german
herald
defends
their
use
by
ecclesiastics
and
says
that
in
germany
at
any
rate
universal
custom
is
opposed
to
the
restriction
there
the
prelates
abbots
and
abbesses
who
held
princely
fiefs
by
military
tenure
naturally
retained
the
full
knightly
insignia
in
official
english
heraldry
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
confirmation
and
a
certain
amount
of
contradiction
of
this
supposed
rule
which
denies
a
helmet
to
an
ecclesiastic
a
grant
of
arms
to
a
clergyman
at
the
present
day
and
at
all
times
previously
after
the
granting
of
crests
had
become
usual
contains
the
grant
of
the
crest
and
the
emblazonment
shows
the
helmet
but
the
grant
of
arms
to
a
bishop
is
different
the
emblazonment
of
the
arms
is
surmounted
by
a
mitre
and
the
crest
is
depicted
in
the
body
of
the
patent
away
from
and
distinct
from
the
emblazonment
proper
in
the
margin
but
the
fact
that
a
crest
is
granted
proves
that
there
is
not
any
disability
inherent
in
the
ecclesiastic
which
debars
him
from
the
possession
of
the
helmet
and
crest
and
the
rule
which
must
be
deduced
and
which
really
is
the
definite
and
accepted
rule
is
that
a
mitre
can
not
be
displayed
together
with
a
helmet
or
crest
it
must
be
one
or
other
and
as
the
mitre
is
indicative
of
the
higher
rank
it
is
the
crest
and
helmet
which
are
discarded
there
are
few
rules
in
heraldry
to
which
exceptions
can
not
be
found
and
there
is
a
painting
now
preserved
in
the
college
of
arms
which
depicts
the
arms
of
the
bishop
of
durham
surmounted
by
a
helmet
that
in
its
turn
being
surmounted
by
the
mitre
of
episcopal
rank
but
the
bishopric
of
durham
was
in
addition
to
its
episcopal
character
a
temporal
palatinate
and
the
arms
of
the
bishops
of
that
see
therefore
logically
present
many
differences
and
exceptions
from
established
heraldic
rules
the
rules
with
regard
to
the
use
of
helmets
for
the
coats
of
arms
of
corporate
bodies
are
somewhat
vague
and
vary
considerably
all
counties
cities
and
towns
and
all
corporate
bodies
to
whom
crests
have
been
granted
in
england
have
the
ordinary
closed
profile
helmet
of
an
esquire
or
gentleman
no
grant
of
a
crest
has
as
yet
been
made
to
an
english
university
so
that
it
is
impossible
to
say
that
no
helmet
would
be
allowed
or
if
it
were
allowed
what
it
would
be
for
some
reason
the
arms
of
the
city
of
london
are
always
depicted
with
the
helmet
of
a
peer
but
as
the
crest
is
not
officially
recorded
the
privilege
necessarily
has
no
official
sanction
or
authority
in
scotland
the
helmet
painted
upon
a
grant
of
arms
to
town
or
city
is
always
the
open
helmet
of
a
knight
or
baronet
but
in
the
grant
of
arms
to
a
county
where
it
includes
a
crest
the
helmet
is
that
of
an
esquire
which
is
certainly
curious
in
ireland
no
helmet
at
all
was
painted
upon
the
patent
granting
arms
to
the
city
of
belfast
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
a
crest
was
included
in
the
grant
and
the
late
ulster
king
of
arms
informed
me
he
would
not
allow
a
helmet
to
any
impersonal
arms
care
should
be
taken
to
avoid
errors
of
anachronism
when
depicting
helmet
and
shield
the
shapes
of
these
should
bear
some
approximate
relation
to
each
other
in
point
of
date
it
is
preferable
that
the
helmet
should
be
so
placed
that
its
lower
extremity
reaches
somewhat
over
the
edge
of
the
shield
the
inclined
position
of
the
shield
in
emblazonment
is
borrowed
from
the
natural
order
of
things
because
the
shield
hanging
by
its
chain
or
the
guige
which
was
so
balanced
that
the
shield
should
most
readily
fall
into
a
convenient
position
when
slung
on
the
shoulders
would
naturally
retain
its
equilibrium
only
in
a
slanting
direction
chapter
xxi
the
crest
if
uncertainty
exists
as
to
the
origin
of
arms
it
is
as
nothing
to
the
huge
uncertainty
that
exists
concerning
the
beginnings
of
the
crest
most
wonderful
stories
are
told
concerning
it
that
it
meant
this
and
meant
the
other
that
the
right
to
bear
a
crest
was
confined
to
this
person
or
the
other
person
but
practically
the
whole
of
the
stories
of
this
kind
are
either
wild
imagination
or
conjecture
founded
upon
insufficient
facts
the
real
facts
which
one
may
as
well
state
first
as
a
basis
to
work
upon
are
very
few
and
singularly
unconvincing
and
are
useless
as
original
data
from
which
to
draw
conclusions
first
of
all
we
have
the
definite
assured
and
certain
fact
that
the
earliest
known
instance
of
a
crest
is
in
and
we
find
evidence
of
the
use
of
arms
before
that
date
the
next
fact
is
that
we
find
infinitely
more
variation
in
the
crests
used
by
given
families
than
in
the
arms
and
that
whilst
the
variations
in
the
arms
are
as
a
rule
trivial
and
not
affecting
the
general
design
of
the
shield
the
changes
in
the
crest
are
frequently
radical
the
crest
borne
by
a
family
at
one
period
having
no
earthly
relation
to
that
borne
by
the
same
family
at
another
again
we
find
that
though
the
occasional
use
of
a
crest
can
by
isolated
instances
be
taken
back
as
already
stated
to
a
fairly
early
period
the
use
of
crests
did
not
become
general
until
very
much
later
another
fact
is
that
except
perhaps
in
the
persons
of
sovereigns
there
is
no
official
instance
nor
any
other
authentic
instance
of
importance
in
which
a
crest
appears
ever
to
have
been
used
by
a
woman
until
these
recent
and
unfortunate
days
when
unofficial
examples
can
be
found
of
the
wildest
ignorance
of
all
armorial
rules
the
foregoing
may
be
taken
as
general
principles
which
no
authentic
instance
known
can
be
said
to
refute
bearing
these
in
mind
let
us
now
see
what
other
results
can
be
obtained
by
deduction
from
specific
instances
the
earliest
form
in
which
anything
can
be
found
in
the
nature
of
a
crest
is
the
lion
upon
the
of
geoffrey
count
of
anjou
fig
this
has
been
already
referred
to
the
helmet
of
philippe
count
of
flanders
has
painted
upon
the
side
the
same
figure
of
a
lion
which
appears
upon
his
shield
what
is
usually
accepted
as
the
earliest
authenticated
instance
of
a
regular
crest
is
that
afforded
by
the
great
seal
of
king
richard
of
england
which
shows
over
the
helmet
a
lion
passant
painted
upon
the
ornament
which
surmounts
the
helmet
if
one
accepts
as
most
people
nowadays
are
inclined
to
do
the
darwinian
theory
of
evolution
the
presumption
is
that
the
development
of
the
human
being
through
various
intermediate
links
including
the
ape
can
be
traced
back
to
those
formations
which
are
the
most
original
types
of
life
which
are
known
to
us
at
the
same
time
one
is
hardly
disposed
to
assert
that
some
antediluvian
jellyfish
away
back
in
past
ages
was
the
first
human
being
by
a
similar
but
naturally
more
restricted
argument
one
can
not
accept
these
paintings
upon
helmets
nor
possibly
can
one
accept
paintings
upon
the
ornaments
which
surmounted
the
helmet
as
examples
of
crests
the
rudiments
and
origin
of
crests
doubtless
they
were
crests
they
were
not
we
must
go
back
once
again
to
the
of
the
vanity
ingrained
in
human
nature
the
same
impulse
which
nowadays
leads
to
the
decoration
of
the
helmets
of
the
life
guards
with
horsehair
plumes
and
regimental
badges
the
cocked
hats
of
and
other
officers
with
waving
plumes
the
képis
of
commissionaires
and
the
smasher
hats
of
colonial
irregulars
with
cocks
feathers
the
hat
of
the
poacher
and
gamekeeper
with
a
pheasant
feather
led
unquestionably
to
the
decoration
of
the
helmets
of
the
armoured
knights
of
old
the
matter
was
just
a
combination
of
decoration
and
vanity
at
first
fig
they
frequently
painted
their
helmets
and
as
with
the
gradual
evolution
and
crystallisation
of
armory
a
certain
form
of
decoration
the
device
upon
his
shield
became
identified
with
a
certain
person
that
particular
device
was
used
for
the
decoration
of
the
helmet
and
painted
thereupon
then
it
was
found
that
a
erection
upon
the
helmet
improved
its
appearance
and
without
adding
greatly
to
its
weight
advantaged
it
as
a
head
protection
by
attracting
the
blow
of
an
opponent
sword
and
lessening
or
nullifying
its
force
ere
the
blow
reached
the
actual
of
the
helmet
possibly
in
this
we
see
the
true
origin
as
in
the
case
of
the
scalloped
edges
of
the
mantling
of
the
serrated
border
which
appears
upon
these
erections
but
this
last
suggestion
is
no
more
than
a
conjecture
of
my
own
and
may
not
be
correct
for
human
nature
has
always
had
a
weakness
for
decoration
and
ever
has
been
agreeable
to
pay
the
extra
penny
in
the
tuppence
for
the
coloured
or
decorated
variety
the
many
instances
which
can
be
found
of
these
ornaments
upon
helmets
in
a
perfectly
undecorated
form
leads
me
to
unhesitatingly
assert
that
they
originated
as
crests
nor
as
a
vehicle
for
the
display
of
crests
but
as
an
integral
and
protective
part
of
the
itself
the
origin
of
the
crest
is
due
to
the
decoration
of
the
fan
the
derivation
of
the
word
crest
from
the
latin
a
cock
comb
should
put
the
supposition
beyond
any
doubt
disregarding
crests
of
later
grant
or
assumption
one
can
assert
with
confidence
that
a
large
proportion
of
those
particularly
in
german
armory
where
they
are
so
frequent
which
we
now
find
blazoned
or
depicted
as
wings
or
plumes
carrying
a
device
are
nothing
more
than
developments
of
or
derivatives
from
these
ornaments

such
decoration
took
the
form

the
particular

with
the
owner

the
device
upon
the
shield
it
seems
to
me
and
for
long
has
so
seemed
essentially
strange
that
no
specialist
authority
writing
upon
armory
has
noticed
that
these
fans
as
i
will
call
them
are
really
a
part
though
possibly
only
a
decorative
part
of
the
helmet
itself
there
has
always
in
these
matters
been
far
too
great
a
tendency
on
the
part
of
writers
to
accept
conclusions
of
earlier
authorities
ready
made
and
to
simply
treat
these
fans
as
selected
and
chosen
crests

instances
of

these
fans
all
are
taken
from
seals
and
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
actual
fans
upon
the
seal
helmets
had
some
device
painted
upon
them
which
it
was
impossible
by
reason
of
the
size
to
represent
upon
the
seal
as
has
been
already
stated
the
great
seal
of
richard
does
show
a
lion
painted
on
the
fan
there
are
many
examples
of
the
heraldic
development
of
these
fans
for
their
use
obtained
even
in
this
country
long
after
the
real
heraldic
crest
had
an
assured
footing
and
a
typical
example
occurs
in
fig
but
probably
the
instance
one
which
has
been
often
illustrated
is
that
from
the
effigy
of
sir
geoffrey
de
luttrell
which
shows
a
fan
of
this
character

way
without
supporters

this
seal
affords
a
curious
but
a
very
striking
and
authentic
instance
of
the
extreme
accuracy
of
the
records
of
the
college
of
arms
there
being
no
crest
for
the
city
of
london
at
the
time
of
the
preparation
of
this
seal
recourse
was
had
to
the
ancient
practice
of
depicting
the
whole
or
a
part
in
this
case
a
part
of
the
device
of
the
shield
upon
a
fan
surmounting
the
helmet
in
course
of
time
this
fan
in
the
case
of
london
as
in
so
many
other
cases
has
through
ignorance
been
converted
or
developed
into
a
wing
but
the
rays
of
the
fan
in
this
instance
are
preserved
in
the
rays
of
the
dragon
wing
charged
with
a
cross
which
the
crest
is
now
supposed
to
be
whilst
dealing
with
the
arms
of
london
one
of
the
favourite
flaring
examples
of
ancient
but
unrecorded
arms
often
mentioned
as
an
instance
in
which
the
records
of
the
college
of
arms
are
at
fault
perhaps
i
may
be
pardoned
for
adding
that
the
shield
recorded
the
crest
and
supporters
are
not
the
seeming
omission
as
to
the
crest
is
explained
above
the
real
supporters
of
the

london

which
a
claim
by
user
even
now
be
established
they
are
two
lions
not
dragons

with
the
single
exception
of
their
use
upon
the
mayor
seal
which
use
is
continued
to
the
present
day
been
practically
discarded
consequently
the
lions
as
supporters
remained
unclaimed
and
therefore
are
not
recorded
the
supporters
now
used
two
dragons
are
adornments
of
which
no
example
can
be
found
before
the
seventeenth
century
those
naturally
being
assumed
without
authority
at
so
recent
a
date
are
not
recorded
which
is
yet
another
testimony
to
the
impartial
accuracy
of
the
heralds
college
records
the
use
of
the
has
long
been
obsolete
in
british
armory
in
which
it
can
hardly
ever
be
said
to
have
had
a
very
great
footing
unless
such
use
was
prevalent
in
the
thirteenth
century
but
it
still
survives
in
germany
at
the
present
day
where
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
many
of
these
fans
have
now
degenerated
into
reduplications
of
the
arms
upon
wings
or
plumes
of
feathers
other
crests
to
a
considerable
number
are
still
displayed
upon
fans
many
of
the
current
practices
in
british
armory
are
the
culmination
of
ignorance
some
mayhap
can
be
allowed
to
pass
without
comment
but
others
deserve
at
any
rate
their
share
of
criticism
and
remark
amongst
such
may
be
included
the
objectionable
practice
in
the
grants
of
so
many
modern
crests
of
making
the
crest
itself
a
carrying
a
repetition
of
the
arms
or
some
other
device
or
of
introducing
in
the
crest
an
escutcheon
to
the
resuscitation
of
these
fan
repetitions
of
the
shield
device
there
is
not
and
can
not
be
any
objection
one
would
even
in
these
days
of
the
multiplication
of
differentiated
crests
recommend
this
as
a
relief
from
the
abominable
rows
of
assorted
objects
nowadays
placed
for
the
purposes
of
differentiation
in
front
of
so
many
modern
crests
one
would
gladly
see
a
reversion
to
the
german
development
from
this
source
of
wings
charged
with
the
arms
or
a
part
of
the
armorial
device
but
one
of
the
things
a
new
grantee
should
pray
to
be
delivered
from
is
an
escutcheon
of
any
sort
shape
or
form
in
the
crest
assigned
to
him
to
return
however
to
the
fans
upon
the
early
helmets
many
of
the
examples
which
have
come
down
to
us
show
the
fan
of
a
rather
diminutive
height
but
in
the
form
of
an
arc
of
a
much
enlarged
circle
projected
far
forward
beyond
the
front
of
the
helmet
and
carried
far
back
apparently
as
a
safeguard
from
blows
which
would
otherwise
descend
upon
the
neck
a
survival
of
the
fan
by
the
way
may
perhaps
be
found
in
the
dragoon
helmets
of
the
time
of
the
peninsular
war
in
the
firemen
helmets
of
and
in
the
helmets
now
worn
by
different
regiments
in
the
italian
army
the
very
shape
of
these
fans
should
prove
they
were
originally
a
protective
part
of
the
helmet
the
long
low
shape
however
did
not
as
a
general
circumstance
lend
itself
to
its
decoration
by
a
duplication
thereupon
of
the
whole
of
the
arms
consequently
these
fans
will
nearly
always
be
found
simply
adorned
with
one
figure
from
the
shield
it
should
not
be
forgotten
that
we
are
now
dealing
with
a
period
in
armory
when
the
charges
upon
the
shield
itself
were
very
much
as
far
as
number
and
position
are
concerned
of
an
indeterminate
character
if
they
were
indeterminate
for
the
shield
it
evidences
that
there
can
not
have
been
any
idea
of
a
necessity
to
repeat
the
whole
of
the
device
upon
the
fan
as
there
was
seldom
room
or
opportunity
for
the
display
of
the
whole
device
we
invariably
find
that
these
fan
decorations
were
a
duplication
of
a
distinctive
part
but
not
necessarily
the
whole
of
the
device
and
this
device
was
disposed
in
the
most
suitable
position
which
the
shape
of
the
fan
would
accommodate
herein
is
the
explanation
of
the
fact
that
whilst
the
arms
of
percy
talbot
and
mowbray
were
all
in
varying
tinctures
a
lion
rampant
the
crest
in
each
case
was
a
lion
passant
or
statant
in
short
the
fan
did
not
lend
itself
to
the
representation
of
a
lion
rampant
and
consequently
there
is
no
early
instance
of
such
a
crest
perhaps
the
insecurity
of
a
large
and
heavy
crest
balanced
upon
one
leg
may
be
an
added
reason
the
next
step
in
the
evolution
of
the
crest
there
can
be
little
doubt
was
the
cutting
of
the
fan
into
the
outline
of
the
crest
and
though
i
know
of
no
instance
of
such
a
crest
on
any
effigy
there
can
be
no
reasonable
doubt
on
the
point
if
a
little
thought
is
given
to
the
matter
until
a
very
much
later
period
we
never
find
in
any
heraldic
representation
that
the
helmet
or
crest
are
represented
in
an
affronté
position
why
simply
because
crests
at
that
period
were
merely
profile
representations
in
later
days
when
tournament
crests
were
made
of
leather
the
weight
even
of
these
was
very
considerable
but
for
tournament
purposes
that
weight
could
be
endured
courses
down
the
would
be
a
vastly
different
matter
to
a
whole
day
under
arms
in
actual
battle
now
a
crest
cut
out
from
a
thin
plate
of
metal
set
on
edge
would
weigh
but
little
but
perhaps
the
strongest
proof
of
all
is
to
be
found
in
the
construction
of
so
many
german
crests
which
are
adorned
down
the
back
with
a
fan
now
it
is
hardly
likely
if
the
in
relief
had
been
the
earliest
form
that
the
fan
would
have
been
subsequently
added
to
it
the
fan
is
nothing
more
than
the
remains
of
the
original
ornament
left
when
the
crest
or
most
likely
only
the
front
outline
of
it
had
been
cut
out
in
profile
from
the
fan
we
have
no
instance
until
a
very
much
later
period
of
a
crest
which
could
not
be
depicted
in
profile
and
in
the
representations
of
crests
upon
seals
we
have
no
means
of
forming
a
certain
judgment
that
these
representations
are
not
of
profile
crests
for
the
very
nature
of
the
craft
of
would
lead
the
engraver
to
add
a
certain
amount
of
relief
even
if
this
did
not
actually
exist
it
is
out
of
the
question
to
suppose
by
reason
of
their
weight
that
crests
were
made
in
metal
but
if
made
of
leather
as
were
the
tournament
crests
what
protection
did
the
crest
add
to
the
helmet
the
fact
that
wreaths
and
coronets
did
not
come
into
use
at
the
earliest
advent
of
crests
is
confirmatory
evidence
of
the
fact
that
modelled
crests
did
not
exist
inasmuch
as
the
fan
prolonged
in
front
and
prolonged
behind
was
narrowed
at
its
point
of
contact
with
the
helmet
into
such
a
diminished
length
that
it
was
comparatively
easy
to
slip
the
mantling
by
means
of
a
slit
over
the
fan
or
even
drape
it
round
it
many
of
the
old
illustrations
of
tournaments
and
battles
which
have
come
down
to
us
show
no
crests
on
the
helmets
but
merely
plumes
of
feathers
or
some
erection
consequently
it
is
a
fairly
safe
conclusion
that
for
the
actual
purposes
of
warfare
modelled
crests
never
had
any
real
existence
or
if
they
had
any
such
existence
that
it
was
most
limited
modelled
crests
were
tournament
crests
the
crests
that
were
used
in
battle
must
have
been
merely
cut
out
in
profile
from
the
fan
then
came
the
era
in
plantagenet
times
of
the
tournament
we
talk
glibly
about
tournaments
but
few
indeed
really
know
much
about
them
trial
by
combat
and
the
real
tournament
seldom
occurred
and
though
trial
by
combat
remained
upon
the
until
the
geo
it
was
seldom
invoked
tournaments
were
chiefly
in
the
nature
of
athletic
displays
taking
the
place
of
our
games
and
sports
and
inasmuch
as
they
contributed
to
the
training
of
the
soldier
were
held
in
the
high
repute
that
polo
for
example
now
enjoys
amongst
the
upper
and
military
classes
added
to
this
the
tournament
was
the
essential
climax
of
ceremony
and
ceremonial
and
in
all
its
details
was
ordered
by
such
strict
regulations
rules

that
its
importance
and
its
position
in
the
public
and
official
estimate
was
far
in
advance
of
its
equivalents
the
joust
was
fought
with
the
tourney
with

the

regulations
for
jousts
and
tournaments
drawn
up
by
the
high
constable
of
england
in
the

show
clearly
that
in
neither
was
contemplated
any
risk
of
life
in
the
tourney
the
swords
were
blunted
and
without
points
but
the
principal
item
was
always
the
joust
which
was
fought
with

the
general

as
to
the
manner
in
which
the

is
very
widespread
a
strong
barrier
was
erected
straight
down
the

of
the

the
knights
were
placed
one
on

into

those
who
will
read

bearing
in

that
mallory
described
legendary
events
of
an
earlier
period
clothed
in
the
manners
and
customs
of
his
own
day
time
of
edward
iv

made
no
attempt
to
reproduce
the
manners

customs
and
real
atmosphere
of
the
arthurian
times
which
could
have
had
no
relation
to
the
manners
and
proceedings
which
sir
thomas
mallory
employs
in
telling
his
legends
will
notice
that
when
it
came
to
jousting
some
courses
would
be
all
that
were
run
between
contending
knights
in
fact
the
tournament
rules
above
referred
to
say
for
the
tourney
that
two
blows
at
passage
and
ten
at
the
joining
ought
to
suffice
the
time
which
this
would
occupy
would
not
exceed
the
period
for
which
any
man
could
easily
sustain
the
weight
of

another
point
needs
to
be
borne
in
mind
the
result
of
a
joust
depended
upon
the
points
scored
the
highest
number
being
gained
for
the
absolute
unhorsing
of
an
opponent
this
however
happened
comparatively
seldom
and
points
or
spears
were
scored
for
the
lances
broken
upon
an
helmet
shield
or
body
and
the
points
so
scored
were
subject
to
deduction
if
the
opponent
horse
were
touched
and
under
other
circumstances
the
head
of
the
which
was
used
was
a
kind
of
rosette
and
heraldic
representations
are
really
incorrect
in
adding
a
point
when
the
weapon
is
described
as
a
whilst
a
fine
point
meeting
a
wooden
shield
or
metal
armour
would
stick
in
the
one
or
glance
off
the
other
and
neither
result
in
the
breaking
of
the
lance
nor
in
the
unhorsing
of
the
opponent
a
broad
rosette
would
convey
a
heavy
shock
but
to
effect
the
desired
object
the
would
need
to
meet
resistance
and
little
would
be
gained
by
knocking
off
an
opponent
ornamental
crest
certainly
no
prize
appears
to
have
been
allotted
for
the
performance
of
this
feat
which
always
attracts
the
imagination
of
the
novelist
whilst
there
was
for
striking
the
sight
of
the
helmet
consequently
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
from
the
protection
to
the
helmet
which
the
fan
of
earlier
date
afforded
and
the
tendency
of
ceremonial
led
to
the
use
in
tournaments
of
helmets
and
elaborate
crests
which
were
not
those
used
in
battle
the
result
is
that
we
find
these
tournament
or
ceremonial
crests
were
of
large
and
prominent
size
and
were
carved
in
wood
or
built
up
of
leather
but
i
firmly
believe
that
these
crests
were
used
only
for
ceremonial
and
tournament
purposes
and
were
never
actually
worn
in
battle
that
these
modelled
crests
in
relief
are
the
ones
that
we
find
upon
effigies
is
only
natural
and
what
one
would
expect
inasmuch
as
a
effigy
displayed
his
garments
and
accoutrements
in
the
most
ornate
and
honourable
form
the
same
idea
exists
at
the
present
day
the
subjects
of
modern
effigies
and
modern
portraits
are
represented
in
robes
and
with
insignia
which
are
seldom
if
ever
worn
and
which
sometimes
even
have
no
existence
in
fact
in
the
same
way
the
ancient
effigies
are
the
representations
of
the
ceremonial
dress
and
not
the
everyday
garb
of
those
for
whom
they
stand
but
even
allowing
all
the
foregoing
it
must
be
admitted
that
it
is
from
these
ceremonial
or
tournament
helmets
and
crests
that
the
heraldic
crest
has
obtained
its
importance
and
herein
lies
the
reason
of
the
exaggerated
size
of
early
heraldic
crests
and
also
the
unsuitability
of
some
few
for
actual
use
tournaments
were
flourishing
in
the
plantagenet
yorkist
and
lancastrian
periods
and
ended
with
the
days
of
the
tudor
dynasty
and
the
plantagenet
period
witnessed
the
rise
of
the
ceremonial
and
heraldic
crest
but
in
the
days
when
crests
had
any
actual
existence
they
were
made
to
fit
the
helmet
and
the
crests
in
figs
show
crests
very
much
more
naturally
disposed
than
those
of
later
periods
crests
appear
to
have
come
into
wider
and
more
general
use
in
germany
at
an
earlier
period
than
is
the
case
in
this
country
for
in
the
early
part
of
the
thirteenth
century
seals
are
there
to
be
met
with
having
only
the
device
of
helmet
and
crest
thereupon
a
proof
that
the
oberwappen
helmet
and
crest
was
then
considered
of
equal
or
greater
value
than
the

but
even
this

can

little
doubt
was
never
carried
in
battle
or
tournament
and
is
no
more
than
a
ceremonial
crest
made
for
the
funeral
pageant
the
heraldic
wings
which
are
so
frequently
met
with
in
crests
are
not
the
natural
wings
of
a
bird
but
are
a
development
from
the
fan
and
in
actual
crests
were
made
of
wooden
or
strips
and
probably
at
an
earlier
date
were
not
intended
to
represent
wings
but
were
mere
pieces
of
wood
painted
and
existing
for
the
display
of
a
certain
device
their
shape
and
position
led
to
their
transition
into
wings
and
then
they
were
covered
with
dyed
or
feathers
it
was
the
art
of
heraldic
emblazonment
which
ignored
the
practical
details
that
first
copied
the
wing
from
nature
actual
crests
were
fastened
to
the
helmets
they
surmounted
by
means
of
ribbons
straps
laces
which
developed
later
into
the
fillet
and
torse
or
rivets
and
in
germany
they
were
ornamented
with
hanging
and
tinkling
metal
leaves
tiny
bells
buffalo
horns
feathers
and
projecting
pieces
of
wood
which
formed
vehicles
for
still
further
decorative
appendages
then
comes
the
question
what
did
the
crest
signify
many
have
asserted
that
no
one
below
the
rank
of
a
knight
had
the
right
to
use
a
crest
in
fact
some
writers
have
asserted
and
doubtless
correctly
as
regards
a
certain
period
that
only
those
who
were
of
tournament
rank
might
assume
the
distinction
and
herein
lies
another
confirmation
of
the
supposition
that
crests
had
a
closer
relation
to
the
tournament
than
to
the
battlefield
doubts
as
to
a
man
social
position
might
disqualify
him
from
participation
in
a
tournament
hence
the
previously
referred
to
but
they
certainly
never
relieved
him
from
the
obligations
of
warfare
imposed
by
the
tenure
under
which
he
held
his
lands
there
is
no
doubt
however
that
whatever
the
regulation
may
have
been
and
there
seems
little
chance
of
our
ever
obtaining
any
real
knowledge
upon
the
point
the
right
to
display
a
crest
was
an
additional
privilege
and
honour
something
extra
and
beyond
the
right
to
a
shield
of
arms
for
how
long
any
such
supposition
held
good
it
is
difficult
to
say
for
whilst
we
find
in
the
latter
part
of
the
fourteenth
century
that
all
the
great
nobles
had
assumed
and
were
using
crests
and
whilst
there
is
but
one
amongst
the
plantagenet
garter
plates
without
a
crest
where
a
helmet
has
been
represented
above
the
shield
we
also
find
that
the
great
bulk
of
the
lesser
landed
gentry
bore
arms
but
made
no
pretension
to
a
crest
the
lesser
gentry
were
bound
to
fight
in
war
but
not
necessarily
in
the
tournament
arms
were
a
necessity
of
warfare
crests
were
not
this
continued
to
be
the
case
till
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
for
we
find
that
at
one
of
the
visitations
no
crests
whatever
are
inserted
with
the
arms
and
pedigrees
of
the
families
set
out
in
the
visitation
book
and
one
is
probably
justified
in
assuming
that
whilst
this
state
of
feeling
and
this
idea
existed
the
crest
was
highly
thought
of
and
valued
possibly
beyond
the
shield
of
arms
for
with
those
of
that
rank
of
life
which
aspired
to
the
display
of
a
crest
the
right
to
arms
would
be
a
matter
of
course
in
the
latter
part
of
the
reign
of
queen
elizabeth
and
in
stuart
days
the
granting
of
crests
to
ancient
arms
became
a
widespread
practice
scores
upon
scores
of
such
grants
can
be
referred
to
and
i
have
myself
been
led
to
the
irresistible
conclusion
that
the
opportunity
afforded
by
the
grant
of
a
crest
was
urged
by
the
heralds
and
officers
of
arms
in
order
to
give
them
the
opportunity
of
confirming
and
recording
arms
which
they
knew
needed
such
confirmation
to
be
rendered
legal
without
giving
offence
to
those
who
had
borne
these
arms
merely
by
strength
of
user
for
some
prolonged
but
at
the
same
time
insufficient
period
to
confer
an
unquestioned
right
that
has
always
seemed
to
me
the
obvious
reason
which
accounts
for
these
numberless
grants
of
crests
to
apparently
existing
arms
which
arms
are
recited
and
emblazoned
in
the
patents
because
there
are
other
grants
of
crests
which
can
be
referred
to
though
these
are
singularly
few
in
number
in
which
the
arms
are
entirely
ignored
but
as
none
of
these
grants
which
are
of
a
crest
only
appear
to
have
been
made
to
families
whose
right
to
arms
was
not
absolutely
beyond
question
or
dispute
the
conclusion
above
recited
appears
to
be
irresistible
the
result
of
these
numerous
grants
of
crests
which
i
look
upon
as
carrying
greater
importance
in
the
sense
that
they
were
also
confirmations
of
the
arms
resulted
in
the
fact
that
the
value
and
dignity
of
the
crest
slowly
but
steadily
declined
and
the
cessation
of
tournaments
and
shortly
afterwards
the
marked
decline
in
funereal
pageantry
no
doubt
contributed
largely
to
the
same
result
throughout
the
stuart
period
instances
can
be
found
though
not
very
frequently
of
grants
of
arms
without
the
grant
of
a
crest
being
included
in
the
patent
but
the
practice
was
soon
to
entirely
cease
and
roughly
speaking
one
may
assert
that
since
the
beginning
of
the
hanoverian
dynasty
no
person
has
ever
been
granted
arms
without
the
corresponding
grant
of
a
crest
if
a
crest
could
be
properly
borne
with
the
arms
now
no
crest
has
ever
been
granted
where
the
right
to
arms
has
not
existed
or
been
simultaneously
conferred
and
therefore
whilst
there
are
still
many
coats
of
arms
legally
in
existence
without
a
crest
a
crest
can
not
exist
without
a
coat
of
arms
so
that
those
people
and
they
are
many
who
vehemently
assert
a
right
to
the
of
their
family
whilst
admitting
they
have
no
right
to
arms
stand
heraldically
both
of
having
spoken
unutterable
rubbish
and
of
using
a
crest
to
which
they
can
have
no
possible
right
one
exception
and
one
only
have
i
ever
come
across
to
the
contrary
and
very
careful
inquiry
can
bring
me
knowledge
of
no
other
that
crest
is
the
crest
of
a
family
of
buckworth
now
represented
by
sir
charles
bart
this
family
at
the
time
of
the
visitations
exhibited
a
certain
coat
of
arms
and
crest
the
coat
of
arms
which
doubtless
interfered
with
the
rights
of
some
other
family
was
respited
for
further
proof
but
the
crest
which
did
not
appears
to
have
been
allowed
and
as
nothing
further
was
done
with
regard
to
the
arms
the
crest
stood
whilst
the
arms
were
bad
but
even
this
one
exception
has
long
since
been
rectified
for
when
the
additional
name
and
arms
of
soame
were
assumed
by
royal
license
the
arms
which
had
been
exhibited
and
respited
were
with
the
addition
of
an
ermine
spot
as
a
charge
upon
the
chevron
granted
as
the
arms
of
buckworth
to
be
borne
quarterly
with
the
arms
of
soame
plate
vi
illustration
with
the
cessation
of
tournaments
we
get
to
the
period
which
some
writers
have
stigmatised
as
that
of
paper
heraldry
that
is
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
arms
and
crests
ceased
to
be
painted
upon
shields
or
erected
upon
helmets
that
enjoyed
actual
use
in
battle
and
tournament
those
who
are
so
ready
to
decry
modern
heraldry
forget
that
from
its
very
earliest
existence
heraldry
has
always
had
the
significance
as
a
symbol
of
rank
and
social
position
which
it
now
enjoys
and
which
remains
undiminished
in
extent
though
doubtless
less
potent
in
effect
they
forget
also
that
from
the
very
earliest
period
armory
had
three
uses
viz
its
martial
use
its
decorative
use
and
its
use
as
a
symbol
of
ownership
the
two
latter
uses
still
remain
in
their
entirety
and
whilst
that
is
the
case
armory
can
not
be
treated
as
a
dead
science
but
with
the
cessation
of
tournaments
the
decorative
became
the
chief
use
of
arms
and
the
crest
soon
ceased
to
have
that
distinctive
adaptability
to
the
purpose
of
a
helmet
ornament
up
to
the
end
of
the
tudor
period
crests
had
retained
their
original
simplicity
animals
heads
and
animals
passant
human
heads
and
comprised
the
large
majority
of
the
early
crests
scottish
heraldry
in
a
marked
degree
has
retained
the
early
simplicity
of
crests
though
at
the
expense
of
lack
of
distinction
between
the
crests
of
different
families
german
heraldry
has
to
a
large
extent
retained
the
same
character
as
has
scottish
armory
and
though
many
of
the
crests
are
decidedly
elaborated
it
is
noticeable
that
this
elaboration
is
never
such
as
to
render
the
crest
unsuitable
for
its
true
position
upon
a
helmet
in
england
this
aspect
of
the
crest
has
been
almost
entirely
lost
sight
of
and
a
large
proportion
of
the
crests
in
modern
english
grants
are
utterly
unsuitable
for
use
in
relief
upon
an
actual
helmet
our
present
rules
of
position
for
a
helmet
and
our
unfortunate
stereotyped
form
of
wreath
are
largely
to
blame
but
the
chief
reason
is
the
definite
english
rule
that
the
crests
of
separate
english
families
must
be
differentiated
as
are
the
arms
no
such
rule
holds
good
in
scotland
hence
their
simple
crests
whether
the
rule
is
good
or
bad
it
is
difficult
to
say
when
all
the
pros
and
cons
have
been
taken
into
consideration
the
whole
discussion
remains
a
matter
of
opinion
and
whilst
one
dislikes
the
scottish
idea
under
which
the
same
identical
crest
can
be
and
regularly
is
granted
to
people
of
as
many
different
surnames
one
objects
very
considerably
to
the
typical
crest
of
an
english
grant
of
arms
whilst
a
collar
can
be
put
round
an
animal
neck
and
whilst
it
can
hold
objects
in
its
mouth
or
paws
it
does
seem
ridiculous
to
put
a
string
of
varied
and
selected
objects
in
front
of
it
when
these
plainly
would
only
be
visible
from
one
side
or
to
put
a
crest
between
objects
if
these
are
to
be
represented
fore
and
aft
one
toppling
over
the
brow
of
the
wearer
of
the
helmet
and
the
other
hanging
down
behind
the
crests
granted
by
the
late
sir
albert
woods
garter
are
the
crying
grievance
of
modern
english
heraldry
and
though
a
large

we
now
come
to
the
subject
of
the
inheritance
of
crests
concerning
which
there
has
been
much
difference
of
opinion
it
is
very
usually
asserted
that
until
a
comparatively
recent
date
crests
were
not
hereditary
but
were
assumed
discarded
and
changed
at
pleasure
like
many
other
incorrect
statements
there
is
a
certain
modicum
of
truth
in
the
statement
for
no
doubt
whilst
arms
themselves
had
a
more
or
less
shifting
character
crests
were
certainly
not
fixed
to
any
greater
extent
but
i
think
no
one
has
as
yet
discovered
or
at
any
rate
brought
into
notice
the
true
facts
of
the
case
or
the
real
position
of
the
matter
and
i
think
i
am
the
first
to
put
into
print
what
actually
were
the
rules
which
governed
the
matter
the
rules
i
believe
were
undoubtedly
these
crests
were
save
in
the
remote
beginning
of
things
heraldic
definitely
hereditary
they
were
hereditary
even
to
the
extent
and
herein
lies
the
point
which
has
not
hitherto
been
observed
that
they
were
transmitted
by
an
heiress
perhaps
this
heritability
was
limited
to
those
cases
in
which
the
heiress
transmitted
the
headship
of
her
house
we
judging
by
present
laws
look
upon
the
crest
as
a
part
of
the
heraldic
achievement
inseparable
from
the
shield
what
proof
have
we
that
in
early
times
any
necessary
connection
between
arms
and
crest
existed
we
have
none
the
shield
of
arms
was
one
inheritance
descending
by
known
rules
the
crest
was
another
but
a
separate
inheritance
descending
equally
through
an
heir
or
the
crest
was
as
an
inheritance
as
separate
from
the
shield
as
were
the
estates
then
the
social
conditions
of
life
prevented
the
possibility
of
the
existence
or
inheritance
of
a
crest
where
arms
did
not
exist
but
a
man
inheriting
several
coats
of
arms
from
different
heiress
ancestresses
could
marshal
them
all
upon
one
shield
and
though
we
find
the
heir
often
made
selection
at
his
pleasure
and
marshalled
the
arms
in
various
methods
the
determination
of
which
was
a
mere
matter
of
arbitrary
choice
he
could
if
he
wished
use
them
all
upon
one
shield
but
he
had
but
one
helmet
and
could
use
and
display
but
one
crest
so
that
if
he
had
inherited
two
he
was
forced
to
choose
which
he
would
use
though
he
sometimes
tried
to
combine
two
into
one
device
it
is
questionable
if
an
instance
can
be
found
in
england
of
the
regular
display
of
two
helmets
and
crests
together
surmounting
one
shield
before
the
eighteenth
century
but
there
are
countless
instances
of
the
contemporary
but
separate
display
of
two
different
crests
and
the
visitation
records
afford
us
some
number
of
instances
of
this
tacit
acknowledgment
of
the
inheritance
of
more
than
one
crest
the
patent
altering
or
granting
the
mowbray
crest
seems
to
me
clear
recognition
of
the
right
of
inheritance
of
a
crest
passing
through
an
heir
female
this
however
it
must
be
admitted
may
be
really
no
more
than
a
grant
and
is
not
in
itself
actual
evidence
that
any
crest
had
been
previously
borne
my
own
opinion
however
is
that
it
is
fair
presumptive
evidence
upon
the
point
and
conveys
an
alteration
and
not
a
grant
the
translation
of
this
patent
patent
roll
ric
ii
pt
memb
is
as
follows
the
king
to
all
to
whom
greeting
know
that
whereas
our
and
faithful
kinsman
thomas
and
earl
of
nottingham
has
a
just
hereditary
title
to
bear
for
his
crest
a
leopard
or
with
a
white
label
which
should
be
of
right
the
crest
of
our
eldest
son
if
we
had
begotten
a
son
we
for
this
consideration
have
granted
for
us
and
our
heirs
to
the
said
thomas
and
his
heirs
that
for
a
difference
in
this
crest
they
shall
and
may
bear
a
leopard
and
in
place
of
a
label
a
crown
argent
without
hindrance
from
us
or
our
heirs
in
witness
witness
the
king
at
westminster
the
day
of
january
ric
by

of
privy
seal
cases
will
constantly
be
found
in
which
the
crests
have
been
changed
i
necessarily
totally
exclude
from
consideration
crests
which
have
been
changed
owing
to
specific
grants
and
also
changes
due
to
the
discarding
of
crests
which
can
be
shown
to
have
been
borne
without
right
changes
in
crests
must
also
be
disregarded
where
the
differences
in
emblazonment
are
merely
differences
in
varying
designs
of
the
same
crest
necessarily
from
none
of
these
instances
can
a
law
of
inheritance
be
deduced
but
if
other
changes
in
the
crests
of
important
families
be
considered
i
think
it
will
be
very
evident
that
practically
the
whole
of
these
are
due
to
the
inheritance
through
heiresses
or
ancestresses
of
an
alternative
crest
it
can
be
readily
shown
that
selection
played
an
important
part
in
the
marshalling
of
quarterings
upon
an
escutcheon
and
where
important
quarterings
were
inherited
they
are
as
often
as
not
found
depicted
in
the
first
quarter
thus
the
howards
have
borne
at
different
periods
the
wings
of
howard
the
horse
of
fitzalan
and
the
royal
crest
granted
to
the
mowbrays
with
remainder
to
the
heir
general
and
these
crests
have
been
borne
as
will
be
seen
from
the
garter
plates
quite
irrespective
of
what
the
surname
in
use
may
have
been
consequently
it
is
very
evident
the
crests
were
considered
to
be
inherited
with
the
representation
of
the
different
families
the
stourton
crest
was
originally
a
stag
head
and
is
to
be
seen
recorded
in
one
of
the
visitations
and
upon
the
earliest
seal
in
existence
of
any
member
of
the
family
but
after
the
inheritance
through
the
heiress
of
le
moyne
the
le
moyne
crest
of
the
was
adopted
the
stanleys
earls
of
derby
whatever
their
original
crest
may
have
been
inherited
the
bird
and
bantling
of
the
family
of
lathom
the
talbot
crest
was
originally
a
talbot
and
this
is
still
so
borne
by
lord
talbot
of
malahide
it
was
recorded
at
the
visitation
of
dublin
but
the
crest
at
present
borne
by
the
earls
of
shrewsbury
is
derived
from
the
arms
inherited
by
descent
from
gwendolin
daughter
of
rhys
ap
griffith
the
nevill
crest
was
a
bull
head
as
it
is
now
borne
by
the
marquess
of
abergavenny
and
as
it
will
be
seen
on
the
garter
plate
of
william
nevill
lord
fauconberg
an
elder
brother
of
lord
fauconberg
had
married
the
heiress
of
the
earl
of
salisbury
and
was
summoned
to
parliament
in
her
earldom
he
quartered
her
arms
which
appear
upon
his
garter
plate
and
seal
in
the
first
and
fourth
quarters
of
his
shield
and
adopted
her
crest
a
younger
son
of
sir
richard
nevill
earl
of
salisbury
bore
the
same
crest
differenced
by
two
annulets
conjoined
which
was
the
difference
mark
added
to
the
shield
the
crest
of
bourchier
was
a
soldan
head
crowned
and
with
a
pointed
cap
issuing
from
the
crown
but
when
the
barony
of
bourchier
passed
to
the
family
of
robsart
as
will
be
seen
from
the
garter
plate
of
sir
lewis
robsart
lord
bourchier
the
crest
of
bourchier
was
adopted
with
the
inheritance
of
the
arms
and
barony
of
bourchier
i
am
aware
of
no
important
case
in
english
heraldry
where
the
change
has
been
due
to
mere
caprice
and
it
would
seem
therefore
an
almost
incontrovertible
assertion
that
changes
were
due
to
inheritance
and
if
that
can
be
established
it
follows
even
more
strongly
that
until
the
days
when
armory
was
brought
under
rigid
and
official
control
and
even
until
a
much
later
date
say
up
to
the
beginning
of
the
stuart
period
crests
were
heritable
through
heiresses
equally
with
quarterings
the
fact
that
we
find
comparatively
few
changes
considering
the
number
of
crests
in
existence
is
by
no
means
a
refutation
of
this
theory
because
a
man
had
but
one
helmet
and
was
forced
therefore
to
make
a
selection
unless
therefore
he
had
a
very
strong
inclination
it
would
be
more
likely
that
he
would
select
the
crest
he
was
used
to
than
a
fresh
one
i
am
by
no
means
certain
that
to
a
limited
extent
the
german
idea
did
not
hold
in
england
this
was
and
is
that
the
crest
had
not
the
same
personal
character
that
was
the
case
with
the
arms
but
was
rather
attached
to
or
an
appanage
of
the
territorial
fief
or
lordship
by
the
time
of
the
restoration
any
idea
of
the
transmission
of
crests
through
heiresses
had
been
abandoned
we
then
find
a
royal
license
necessary
for
the
assumption
of
arms
and
crests
since
that
date
it
has
been
and
at
the
present
time
it
is
stringently
held
and
is
the
official
rule
that
no
woman
can
bear
or
inherit
a
crest
and
that
no
woman
can
transmit
a
right
to
one
whilst
that
is
the
official
and
accepted
interpretation
of
heraldic
law
upon
the
point
and
whilst
it
can
not
now
be
gainsaid
it
can
not
however
be
stated
that
the
one
assertion
is
the
logical
deduction
of
the
other
for
whilst
a
woman
can
not
inherit
a
lordship
of
parliament
she
undoubtedly
can
transmit
one
together
with
the
titular
honours
the
enjoyment
of
which
is
not
denied
to
her
in
scotland
crests
have
always
had
a
very
much
less
important
position
than
in
england
there
has
been
little
if
any
continuity
with
regard
to
them
and
instances
of
changes
for
which
caprice
would
appear
to
be
the
only
reason
are
met
with
in
the
cases
of
a
large
proportion
of
the
chief
families
in
that
kingdom
to
such
a
widespread
extent
has
the
permissive
character
been
allowed
to
the
crest
that
many
cases
will
be
found
in
which
each
successive
matriculation
for
the
head
of
the
house
or
for
a
cadet
has
produced
a
change
in
the
crest
and
instances
are
to
be
found
where
the
different
crests
are
the
only
existing
differences
in
the
achievements
of
a
number
of
cadets
of
the
same
family
at
the
present
time
little
if
any
objection
is
ever
made
to
an
entire
and
radical
change
in
the
crest
if
this
is
wished
at
the
time
of
a
rematriculation
and
as
far
as
i
can
gather
such
changes
appear
to
have
always
been
permitted
perhaps
it
may
be
well
here
to
point
out
that
this
is
not
equivalent
to
permission
to
change
the
crest
at
pleasure
because
the
patent
of
matriculation
until
it
is
superseded
by
another
is
the
authority
and
the
compulsory
authority
for
the
crest
which
is
to
be
borne
in
germany
the
crest
has
an
infinitely
greater
importance
than
is
the
case
with
ourselves
but
it
is
there
considered
in
a
large
degree
a
territorial
appanage
and
it
is
by
no
means
unusual
in
a
german
achievement
to
see
several
crests
surmounting
a
single
coat
of
arms
in
england
the
royal
coat
of
arms
has
really
three
crests
although
the
crests
of
scotland
and
ireland
are
seldom
used
which
it
may
be
noted
are
all
in
a
manner
territorial
but
the
difference
of
idea
with
which
crests
are
regarded
in
germany
may
be
gathered
from
the
fact
that
the
king
of
saxony
has
five
the
grand
duke
of
five
the
grand
duke
of
six
the
grand
duke
of
seven
the
duke
of
anhalt
seven
the
duke
of
and
gotha
six
the
prince
of
six
the
prince
of
six
the
prince
of
five
the
prince
of
lippe
five
the
duke
of
brunswick
five
and
instances
can
be
quoted
of
sixteen
and
seventeen
probably
woodward
is
correct
when
he
says
that
each
crest
formerly
denoted
a
noble
fief
for
which
the
proprietor
had
a
right
to
vote
in
the
circles
of
the
empire
and
he
instances
the
margraves
of
who
were
entitled
to
no
less
than
thirteen
crests
in
france
the
use
of
crests
is
not
nearly
so
general
as
in
england
or
germany
in
spain
and
portugal
it
is
less
frequent
still
and
in
italy
the
use
of
a
crest
is
the
exception
the
german
practice
of
using
horns
on
either
side
of
the
crest
which
the
ignorance
of
english
heralds
has
transformed
into
the
proboscides
of
elephants
is
dealt
with
at
some
length
on
page
the
horns
which
are
termed
buffalo
or
bull
horns
until
the
middle
of
the
thirteenth
century
were
short
and
it
is
difficult
to
say
at
what
date
these
figures
came
to
be
considered
as
heraldic
for
as
mere
helmet
ornaments
they
probably
can
be
traced
back
very
far
beyond
any
proof
of
the
existence
of
armory
in
the
fourteenth
century
we
find
the
horns
curved
inwards
like
a
sickle
but
later
the
horns
are
found
more
erect
the
points
turning
outwards
slimmer
in
shape
and
finally
they
exhibit
a
decidedly
marked
double
curve
then
the
ends
of
the
horns
are
met
with
open
like
a
trumpet
the
fact
which
gave
rise
to
the
erroneous
idea
that
they
represented
elephants
trunks
the
horns
became
ornamented
with
feathers
banners
branches
of
leaves
balls
and
the
orifices
garnished
with
similar
adornments
in
england
crests
are
theoretically
subject
to
marks
of
cadency
and
difference
this
is
not
the
case
however
in
any
other
country
in
germany
in
cases
where
the
crests
reproduce
the
arms
any
mark
of
cadency
with
which
the
arms
are
distinguished
will
of
course
be
repeated
but
in
german
heraldry
doubtless
owing
to
the
territorial
nature
of
the
crest
a
change
in
the
crest
itself
is
often
the
only
mark
of
distinction
between
different
branches
of
the
same
family
and
in
siebmacher
different
branches
of
the
zorn
family
have
different
crests
which
are
the
sole
marks
of
difference
in
the
achievements
but
though
british
crests
are
presumed
to
be
subject
to
the
recognised
marks
of
cadency
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
very
seldom
indeed
that
they
are
ever
so
marked
with
the
exception
that
the
mark
used
usually
a
cross
crosslet
to
signify
the
lack
of
blood
relationship
when
arms
are
assumed
under
a
royal
license
is
compulsory
marks
of
distinction
added
to
signify
illegitimacy
are
also
compulsory
and
perpetual
what
these
marks
are
will
be
dealt
with
in
a
subsequent
chapter
upon
the
subject
how
very
seldom
a
mark
of
difference
is
added
to
a
crest
may
be
gathered
from
the
fact
that
with
the
exception
of
labels
chiefly
upon
the
royal
crest
one
crest
only
amongst
the
plantagenet
garter
plates
is
differenced
that
one
being
the
crest
of
john
neville
lord
montague
several
crests
however
which
are
not
royal
are
differenced
by
similar
labels
to
those
which
appear
upon
the
shields
but
when
we
find
that
the
difference
marks
have
very
much
of
a
permissive
character
even
upon
the
shield
it
is
not
likely
that
they
are
perpetuated
upon
the
crest
where
they
are
even
less
desirable
the
arms
of
cokayne
as
given
in
the
funeral
certificate
of
sir
william
cokayne
lord
mayor
of
london
show
upon
the
shield
three
crescents
sable
or
and
gules
charged
one
upon
the
other
the
lord
mayor
being
the
second
son
of
a
second
son
of
cokayne
of
sturston
descending
from
william
second
son
of
sir
john
cokayne
of
ashborne
but
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
three
difference
marks
are
charged
upon
the
shield
one
of
the
quarterings
of
which
by
the
way
has
an
additional
mark
the
crest
itself
is
only
differenced
by
one
crescent
these
difference
marks
as
applied
to
arms
are
in
england
the
rules
in
scotland
are
utterly
distinct
practically
permissive
and
are
never
enforced
against
the
wish
of
the
bearer
except
in
one
circumstance
if
owing
to
the
grant
of
a
crest
or
supporters
or
a
royal
license
or
any
similar
opportunity
a
formal
exemplification
of
the
arms
is
entered
on
the
books
of
the
college
of
arms
the
opportunity
is
generally
taken
to
add
such
mark
of
cadency
as
may
be
necessary
and
no
certificate
would
be
officially
issued
to
any
one
claiming
arms
through
that
exemplification
except
subject
to
the
mark
of
cadency
therein
depicted
in
such
cases
as
these
the
crest
is
usually
differenced
because
the
necessity
for
an
exemplification
does
not
often
occur
except
owing
to
the
establishment
of
an
important
branch
of
the
family
which
is
likely
to
continue
as
a
separate
house
in
the
future
and
possibly
to
rival
the
importance
of
the
chief
of
the
name
two
examples
will
show
my
meaning
the
crest
of
the
duke
of
bedford
is
a
goat
statant
argent
armed
or
when
earl
russell
the
third
son
of
the
sixth
duke
of
bedford
was
so
created
the
arms
crest
and
supporters
were
charged
with
a
mullet
argent
when
the
first
lord
ampthill
who
was
the
third
son
of
the
father
of
the
ninth
duke
of
bedford
was
so
created
the
arms
of
russell
with
the
crest
and
supporters
were
also
charged
with
mullets
these
being
of
different
tinctures
from
those
granted
to
earl
russell
the
crest
of
the
duke
of
westminster
is
a
talbot
statant
or
the
first
lord
stalbridge
was
the
second
son
of
the
marquess
of
westminster
his
arms
crest
and
supporters
were
charged
with
a
crescent
lord
ebury
was
the
third
son
of
the
first
marquess
of
westminster
his
arms
crest
and
supporters
were
charged
with
a
mullet
in
cases
of
this
kind
the
mark
of
difference
upon
the
crest
would
be
considered
permanent
but
for
ordinary
purposes
and
in
ordinary
circumstances
the
rule
may
be
taken
to
be
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
add
the
mark
of
cadency
to
a
crest
even
when
it
is
added
to
the
shield
but
that
at
the
same
time
it
is
not
incorrect
to
do
so
crests
must
nowadays
always
be
depicted
upon
either
a
wreath
coronet
or
chapeau
but
these
and
the
rules
concerning
them
will
be
considered
in
a
more
definite
and
detailed
manner
in
the
separate
chapters
in
which
those
objects
are
discussed
crests
are
nowadays
very
frequently
used
upon
livery
buttons
such
a
usage
is
discussed
at
some
length
in
the
chapter
on
badges
when
two
or
more
crests
are
depicted
together
and
when
as
is
often
the
case
in
england
the
wreaths
are
depicted
in
space
and
without
the
intervening
helmets
the
crests
always
all
face
to
the
dexter
side
and
the
stereotyped
character
of
english
crests
perhaps
more
than
any
other
reason
has
led
of
late
to
the
depicting
of
english
helmets
all
placed
to
face
in
the
same
direction
to
the
dexter
side
but
if
as
will
often
be
found
the
two
helmets
are
turned
to
face
each
other
the
crests
also
must
be
turned
where
there
are
two
crests
the
one
on
the
dexter
side
is
the
first
and
the
one
on
the
sinister
side
is
the
second
when
there
are
three
the
centre
one
comes
first
then
the
one
on
the
dexter
side
then
the
one
on
the
sinister
when
there
are
four
crests
the
first
one
is
the
dexter
of
the
two
inner
ones
the
second
is
the
sinister
inner
one
the
third
is
the
dexter
outer
and
the
fourth
the
sinister
outer
when
there
are
five
and
i
know
of
no
greater
number
in
this
country
they
run
as
follows
centre
dexter
inner
sinister
inner
dexter
outer
sinister
outer
a
very
usual
practice
in
official
emblazonments
in
cases
of
three
crests
is
to
paint
the
centre
one
of
a
larger
size
and
at
a
slightly
lower
level
than
the
others
in
the
case
of
four
nos
and
would
be
of
the
same
size
nos
and
slightly
smaller
and
slightly
raised
it
is
a
very
usual
circumstance
to
see
two
or
more
crests
displayed
in
england
but
this
practice
is
of
comparatively
recent
date
how
recent
may
be
gathered
from
the
fact
that
in
scotland
no
single
instance
can
be
found
before
the
year
in
which
two
crests
are
placed
above
the
same
shield
scottish
heraldry
however
has
always
been
purer
than
english
and
the
practice
in
england
is
much
more
ancient
though
i
question
if
in
england
any
authentic
official
exemplification
can
be
found
before
there
are
however
many
cases
in
the
visitation
books
in
which
two
crests
are
allowed
to
the
same
family
but
this
fact
does
not
prove
the
point
because
a
visitation
record
is
merely
an
official
record
of
inheritance
and
possession
and
not
necessarily
evidence
of
a
regulation
permitting
the
simultaneous
display
of
more
than
one
it
is
of
course
impossible
to
use
two
sets
of
supporters
with
a
single
shield
but
there
are
many
peers
who
are
entitled
to
two
sets
lord
ancaster
i
believe
is
entitled
to
three
sets
but
an
official
record
in
such
a
case
would
probably
emblazon
both
sets
as
evidence
of
right
by
painting
the
shield
twice
over
during
the
eighteenth
century
we
find
many
instances
of
the
grant
of
additional
crests
of
augmentation
and
many
exemplifications
under
royal
license
for
the
use
of
two
and
three
crests
since
that
day
the
correctness
of
duplicate
crests
has
never
been
questioned
where
the
right
of
inheritance
to
them
has
been
established
the
right
of
inheritance
to
two
or
more
crests
at
the
present
time
is
only
officially
allowed
in
the
following
cases
if
a
family
at
the
time
of
the
visitations
had
two
crests
recorded
to
them
these
would
be
now
allowed
if
descent
can
be
proved
from
a
family
to
whom
a
certain
crest
was
allowed
and
also
from
ancestors
at
an
earlier
date
who
are
recorded
as
entitled
to
bear
a
different
crest
the
two
would
be
allowed
unless
it
was
evident
that
the
later
crest
had
been
granted
assigned
or
exemplified
of
the
earlier
one
two
crests
are
allowed
in
the
few
cases
which
exist
where
a
family
has
obtained
a
grant
of
arms
in
ignorance
of
the
fact
that
they
were
then
entitled
to
bear
arms
and
crest
of
an
earlier
date
to
which
the
right
has
been
subsequently
proved
but
on
this
point
it
should
be
remarked
that
if
a
right
to
arms
is
known
to
exist
a
second
grant
in
england
is
refused
unless
the
petition
asks
for
it
to
be
borne
instead
of
and
in
lieu
of
the
earlier
one
it
is
then
granted
in
those
terms
to
those
who
think
that
the
heralds
college
is
a
mere
institution
the
following
experience
of
an
intimate
friend
of
mine
may
be
of
interest
in
placing
his
pedigree
upon
record
it
became
evident
that
his
descent
was
not
legitimate
and
he
therefore
petitioned
for
and
obtained
a
royal
license
to
bear
the
name
and
arms
of
the
family
from
which
he
had
sprung
but
the
illegitimacy
was
not
modern
and
no
one
would
have
questioned
his
right
to
the
name
which
all
the
other
members
of
the
family
bear
if
he
had
not
himself
raised
the
point
in
order
to
obtain
the
ancient
arms
in
the
necessarily
differenced
form
the
arms
had
always
been
borne
with
some
four
or
five
quarterings
and
with
two
crests
and
he
was
rather
annoyed
that
he
had
to
go
back
to
a
simple
coat
of
arms
and
single
crest
he
obtained
a
grant
for
his
wife
who
was
an
heiress
and
then
with
the
idea
of
obtaining
an
additional
quartering
and
a
second
crest
he
conceived
the
brilliant
idea
for
money
was
of
no
object
to
him
of
putting
his
brother
forward
as
a
petitioner
for
arms
to
be
granted
to
him
and
his
descendants
and
to
the
other
descendants
of
his
father
a
grant
which
would
of
course
have
brought
in
my
friend
he
moved
heaven
and
earth
to
bring
this
about
but
he
was
met
with
the
direct
statement
that
two
grants
of
arms
could
not
be
made
to
the
same
man
to
be
borne
simultaneously
and
that
if
he
persisted
in
the
grant
of
arms
to
his
brother
his
own
name
as
being
then
entitled
to
bear
arms
would
be
specifically
exempted
from
the
later
grant
and
the
result
was
that
this
second
grant
was
never
made
in
scotland
where
is
constantly
going
on
two
separate
matriculations
the
same
would
not
confer
the
right
to
two
crests
inasmuch
as
the
last
matriculation
supersedes
everything
which
has
preceded
it
but
if
a
cadet
matriculates
a
different
crest
succeeds
to
the
representation
under
an
earlier
matriculation
he
legally
succeeds
to
both
crests
and
incidentally
to
both
coats
of
arms
as
a
matter
of
ordinary
practice
the
cadet
matriculation
is
discarded
a
curious
case
however
occurs
when
after
matriculation
by
a
cadet
there
is
a
matriculation
behind
it
by
some
one
nearer
the
head
of
the
house
to
which
the
cadet
succeeds
in
which
event
selection
must
be
brought
into
play
when
succession
to
both
occurs
but
the
selection
lies
only
between
the
two
patents
and
not
from
varied
constituent
parts
where
as
an
augmentation
an
additional
crest
is
granted
as
has
been
the
case
in
many
instances
of
course
a
right
to
the
double
crest
is
thereby
conferred
and
a
crest
of
augmentation
is
not
granted
in
lieu
but
in
addition
a
large
number
of
these
additional
crests
have
been
granted
under
specific
warrants
from
the
crown
and
in
the
case
of
lord
gough
two
additional
crests
were
granted
as
separate
augmentations
and
under
separate
patents
lord
kitchener
recently
received
a
grant
of
an
additional
crest
of
augmentation
there
are
also
a
number
of
grants
on
record
not
officially
ranking
as
augmentations
in
which
a
second
crest
has
been
granted
as
a
memorial
of
descent
or
office
the
other
cases
in
which
double
and
treble
crests
occur
are
the
results
of
exemplifications
following
upon
royal
licenses
to
assume
name
and
arms
as
a
rule
when
an
additional
surname
is
adopted
by
royal
license
the
rule
is
that
the
arms
adopted
are
to
be
borne
in
addition
to
those
previously
in
existence
and
where
one
name
is
adopted
instead
of
another
the
warrant
very
frequently
permits
this
and
at
the
same
time
permits
or
requires
the
new
arms
to
be
borne
quarterly
with
those
previously
possessed
and
gives
the
right
to
two
crests
but
in
cases
where
names
and
arms
are
assumed
by
royal
license
the
arms
and
crest
or
crests
are
in
accordance
with
the
patent
of
exemplification
which
no
matter
what
its
terms
for
some
do
not
expressly
exclude
any
prior
rights
is
always
presumed
to
supersede
everything
which
has
gone
before
and
to
be
the
authority
by
which
the
subsequent
bearing
of
arms
is
regularised
and
controlled
roughly
speaking
under
a
royal
license
one
generally
gets
the
right
to
one
crest
for
every
surname
and
if
the
original
surname
be
discarded
in
addition
a
crest
for
every
previous
surname
thus
has
three
crests
has
four
and
the
last
duke
of
buckingham
and
chandos
who
held
the
record
had
one
for
each
of
his
surnames
namely
in
addition
to
the
foregoing
there
are
one
or
two
exceptions
which
it
is
difficult
to
explain
the
marquess
of
bute
for
some
reason
or
other
obtained
a
grant
in
the
year
of
the
crest
of
herbert
the
original
lord
liverpool
obtained
a
grant
of
an
additional
crest
possibly
an
augmentation
and
his
representative
lord
hawkesbury
afterwards
created
earl
of
liverpool
for
some
reason
or
other
which
i
am
quite
at
a
loss
to
understand
obtained
a
grant
of
a
crest
very
similar
to
that
of
lord
liverpool
to
commemorate
the
representation
which
had
devolved
upon
him
he
subsequently
obtained
a
grant
of
a
third
crest
this
last
being
of
augmentation
sir
charles
young
garter
king
of
arms
obtained
the
grant
of
a
second
crest
and
a
former
marquess
of
camden
did
the
same
thing
lord
swansea
is
another
recent
case
and
though
the
right
of
any
person
to
obtain
the
grant
of
a
second
crest
is
not
officially
admitted
and
is
in
fact
strenuously
denied
i
can
not
for
the
life
of
me
see
how
in
the
face
of
the
foregoing
precedents
any
such
privilege
can
be
denied
sir
william
woods
also
obtained
the
grant
of
a
second
crest
when
he
was
garter
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
he
had
not
really
established
a
right
to
arms
those
he
used
were
certainly
granted
in
lyon
office
to
a
relative
but
no
matriculation
of
them
in
his
own
name
was
ever
registered
chapter
xxii
crowns
and
coronets
the
origin
of
the
crown
or
coronet
is
of
course
to
be
met
with
in
the
diadem
and
fillet
in
one
of
the
cantor
lectures
delivered
by
cyril
davenport
in
february
on
the
history
of
personal
jewellery
from
prehistoric
times
he
devoted
considerable
attention
to
the
development
of
the
diadem
and
the
following
extracts
are
from
the
printed
report
of
his
lecture
the
bandeau
or
fillet
tied
round
the
head
was
probably
first
used
to
keep
long
hair
from
getting
into
the
eyes
of
primitive
man
presently
it
became
specialised
priests
wearing
one
pattern
and
fighting
men
another
the
soft
band
which
can
be
seen
figured
on
the
heads
of
kings
in
early
coins
is
no
doubt
a
mark
of
chieftainship
this
use
of
a
band
of
special
colour
to
indicate
authority
probably
originated
in
the
east
it
was
adopted
by
alexander
the
great
who
also
used
the
diadem
of
the
king
of
persia
justinian
says
that
alexander
predecessors
did
not
wear
any
diadem
justinian
also
tells
us
that
the
diadems
then
worn
were
of
some
soft
material
as
in
describing
the
accidental
wounding
of
lysimachus
by
alexander
he
says
that
the
hurt
was
bound
up
by
alexander
his
own
this
was
considered
a
lucky
omen
for
lysimachus
who
actually
did
shortly
afterwards
become
king
of
thrace
in
egypt
diadems
of
particular
shape
are
of
very
ancient
use
there
were
crowns
for
upper
and
lower
egypt
and
a
combination
of
both
for
the
whole
country
they
were
also
distinguished
by
colour
the
uraeus
or
snake
worn
in
the
crowns
and
of
the
pharaohs
was
a
symbol
of
royalty
representations
of
the
egyptian
gods
always
show
them
as
wearing
crowns

some
of

perhaps
crowns

to
say
which
because
the
material
of

they

can
not
be
ascertained

they
were
probably
crowns

they

morimus
tried
to
hang
himself
with
the

evidently
a
bandeau
sent
to
him
by
mithridates
the
roman
royal
diadem
was
originally
a
white
ribbon
a
wreath
of
laurel

the
reward
of
distinguished
citizens
while
a
circlet
of
golden
leaves
was
given
to

cæsar
consistently
refused
the
royal
white
diadem
which
antony
offered
him
preferring
to
remain

dictator
one
of

ventured
to
crown
cæsar
bust
with
a
coronet
of
laurel
tied
with
royal
white
ribbon
but
the
tribunes
quickly
removed
it
and
heavily
punished
the
perpetrator
of
the
offence
during
the
roman
empire
the
prejudice
against
the
white
bandeau
remained
strong
the
emperors
dared
not
wear
it

wished
to
do
so
but
was
dissuaded

being

that
such
a
proceeding

cost

wear
a
diadem
studded
with
precious
stones
but
it
is
not
supposed
to
have
indicated
rank
but
only
to
have
been
a
rich
parure
this
emperor
being
fond
of
dressing
himself
up
as
a

took
alexander

his

diadem

which
was
used
by
the
kings
of

on

row
of
pearls
sewn
on
a
double
band
and

knot

diadems
gradually
closed
in
and
became
crowns
and
on

highly
ornate
diadems

be
recognised

one

be
the
survival
of
the
loose
ends
of
the
tie
of
the
original
fillet
in
later
times
of
greece
and
rome
owing
to
the
growth
of
republican
feeling
the
diadem
lost
its
political
significance
and
was
relegated
to
the
ladies
in
the
middle
ages
the
diadem
regained
much
of
its
earlier
significance
and
ceased
to
be
only
the
simple
head
ornament
it
had
become
now
it
became
specialised
in
form
reserved
as
an
emblem
of
rank
the
forms
of
royal
crowns
and
diadems
is
a
large
and
fascinating
study
and
where
original
examples
do
not
now
exist
the
development
can
often
be
followed
in
sculpture
coins
or
seals
heraldry
now
plays
an
important
part
diadems
or
circlets
gradually
give
way
to
closed
crowns
in
the
case
of
sovereigns
possessing
independent
authority
but
to
pass
to
the
crown
proper
there
is
no
doubt
that
from
the
earliest
times
of
recorded
history
crowns
have
been
a
sign
and
emblem
of
sovereignty
it
equally
admits
of
no
doubt
that
the
use
of
a
crown
or
coronet
was
by
no
means
exclusive
to
a
sovereign
but
whilst
our
knowledge
is
somewhat
curtailed
as
to
the
exact
relation
in
which
great
overlords
and
nobles
stood
to
their
sovereign
it
is
difficult
to
draw
with
any
certainty
or
exactitude
definitive
conclusions
of
the
symbolism
a
crown
or
coronet
conveyed
throughout
europe
in
the
eleventh
twelfth
and
thirteenth
and
well
into
the
fourteenth
centuries
the
great
territorial
lords
enjoyed
and
exercised
many
in
fact
most
of
the
attributes
of
sovereignty
and
in
england
especially
where
the
king
was
no
more
than
the
first
amongst
his
peers
the
territorial
earls
were
in
much
the
position
of
petty
sovereigns
it
is
only
natural
therefore
that
we
should
find
them
using
this
emblem
of
sovereignty
but
what
we
do
find
in
england
is
that
a
coronet
or
fillet
was
used
apparently
without
let
or
hindrance
by
even
knights
it
is
however
a
matter
for
thought
as
to
whether
many
of
these
fillets
were
not
simply
the
turban
or
puggaree
folded
into
the
shape
of
a
fillet
but
capable
of
being
unrolled
if
desired
what
the
object
of
the
wholesale
wearing
of
crowns
and
coronets
was
it
is
difficult
to
conjecture
the
development
of
the
crown
of
the
english
sovereigns
has
been
best
told
by
cyril
davenport
in
his
valuable
work
on
the
english
regalia
kegan
paul
trench
trübner
davenport
whose
knowledge
on
these
matters
is
probably
unequalled
may
best
be
allowed
to
tell
the
story
in
his
own
words
he
and
his
publishers
having
very
kindly
permitted
this
course
to
be
taken
the
crown
of
great
britain
by
cyril
davenport
crowns
appear
to
have
been
at
an
early
period
worn
by
kings
in
battle
in
order
that
they
might
be
easily
recognised
and
although
it
is
quite
possible
that
this
outward
sign
of
sovereignty
may
have
marked
the
wearer
as
being
entitled
to
special
protection
by
his
own
men
it
is
also
likely
that
it
was
often
a
dangerous
sign
of
importance
upon
the
authority
of
their
coins
the
heads
of
the
early
british
kings
were
adorned
with
variously
formed
fillets
and
ornamental
wreaths
helmets
are
also
evidently
intended
to
be
shown
and
on
some
of
the
coins
of
athelstan
the
helmet
bears
upon
it
a
crown
of
three
raised
points

single

this

so
we
may
consider
that
the
growth
of
the
ornament
on
the
rim

the
crown
has
followed
a
regular
sequence
from
the
points
with
one
pearl

æthelstan
to
the
trefoil
of
canute
the
arches
began
with
edward
the

the
centre
trefoil
turned
into
the
of
henry
vi
the
fact
that
the
remaining
trefoils
turned
eventually
into

only
i
think
a
natural
expansion
of
form
and
does
not
appear
to
have
had
anything
to
do
with
the
french
which
was
adopted
as
an
heraldic
bearing
for
an
entirely
different
reason
the
royal
coat
of
arms
of
england
did
bear
for
a
long
time
in
one
of
its
quarterings
the
actual
of
france
and
this
no
doubt
has
given
some
reason
to
the
idea
that
the
on
the
crown
had
also
something
to
do
with
france
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
had
existed
on
the
crown
of
england
long
anterior
to
our
use
of
them

the
coat
of

well
as

their
discontinuance

the

of
william
as
we
often
find
the
centre
trefoil
into
which
as
we
have
seen
these
three
points
eventually
turned
has
a
tendency
to
become
larger
than
the

this
difference
has
been
easily
made
more
apparent

not

forgotten
that
the

actually
used

it
is
just
possible
it
may
have
had
some
specially
english
significance
i
have
already
mentioned
that
as
well
as
the

that

designs
of
it
that
have
been
already
mentioned
as

of

edward

show
that
in
a
sensual
form
it
was
the
same
as
now
indeed
the
existing

is
in
all
probability
mainly
composed

the

at

soon
after

the

of
irregular
form
measuring
about
ins
in
length
and
is
highly
polished
on
what
is
probably
its
natural
surface

nearly
so
its
irregular
outline
makes
it
possible
to
recognise
the
place
that
it

formerly
occupied

always
to
have
been

to
have
given
it
to
edward
the
black
prince
after
the
battle
of
najera
near
vittoria
in
the
same
year
after
this
it
is
said
to
have
been
worn
by
henry
in
his
crown
at
agincourt
in
when
it
is
recorded
that
the
king
life
was
saved
from
the
attack
of
the
duc
because
of
the
protection
afforded
him
by
his
crown
a
portion
of
which
however
was
broken
off
it
may
be
confidently
predicted
that
such
a
risk
of
destruction
is
not
very
likely
to
happen
again

the
great
ruby

the
centre
of

very
ornamental

a
ruby

each
of
the
the
upper
corners
of

have
each
a
large
pearl

an
arch
of
silver
worked
into
a

brilliant
diamonds

ornamented
with

line
of
large

come
out
of
the

of
edward
the
confessor
which
was
buried
with
him
in
his
shrine
at
westminster

the
possession

supposed
to
give
to
the
owner
the
power
of
curing
the

indeed

the

for
use
on
this
one
occasion
and
has
since
been
broken
up
there
is
yet
another
crown
probably
the
one
with
which
we
are
most
familiar
this
is
a
small
crown
entirely
composed
of
diamonds
and
the
earliest
heraldic
use
which
can
be
found
of
it
is
in
the
design
by
sir
edgar
boehm
for
the
jubilee
coinage
though
effective
enough
when
worn
it
does
not
from
its
small
size
lend
itself
effectively
to
pictorial
representation
and
as
will
be
remembered
the
design
of
the
coinage
was
soon
abandoned
this
crown
was
made
at
the
personal
expense
of
queen
victoria
and
under
her
instructions
owing
to
the
fact
that
her
late
majesty
found
her
state
crown
uncomfortable
to
wear
and
too
heavy
for
prolonged
or
general
use
it
is
understood
also
that
the
queen
found
the
regulations
concerning
its
custody
both
inconvenient
and
irritating
during
the
later
part
of
her
reign
this
smaller
crown
was
the
only
one
queen
victoria
ever
wore
by
her
will
the
crown
was
settled
as
an
heirloom
upon
queen
alexandra
to
devolve
upon
future
queens
consort
for
the
time
being
this
being
the
case
it
is
not
unlikely
that
in
the
future
this
crown
may
come
to
be
regarded
as
a
part
of
the
national
regalia
and
it
is
as
well
therefore
to
reiterate
the
remark
that
it
was
made
at
the
personal
expense
of
her
late
majesty
and
is
to
no
extent
and
in
no
way
the
property
of
the
nation

reason
no

than
for
the
greater
interest
these

necessarily
possess
for
readers
in

country
english
coronets
will
first
claim
our
attention
it
has
been
already
observed
that
coronets
or
jewelled
fillets
are
to
be
found
upon
the
helmets
even
of
simple
knights
from
the
earliest
periods
they
probably
served
no
more
than
decorative
purposes
unless
these
fillets
be
merely
turbans
or
suggestions
thereof
as
late
as
the
fifteenth
century
there
appears
to
have
been
no
regularised
form
as
will
be
seen
from
fig
which
represents
the
coronet
as
shown
upon
the
effigy
of
thomas
fitzalan
earl
of
arundel
in
arundel
church
a
very
similar
coronet
surmounts
the
of
the
effigy
of
beatrice
countess

at
the

period
in
his
will
lionel
duke
of
clarence
bequeaths
two
golden
circles
with
one
of
which
he
was
created
duke
it
is
of
interest
to
compare
this
with
fig
which
represents
the
crown
of
king
henry
iv
as
represented
on
his
effigy

his

joan
and
his
tierce
coronne
to
his
daughter
alice
though
not
definite
proof
of
the
point
the
fact
that
the
earl
distributes
his
coronets
amongst
his
family
irrespective
of
the
fact
that
the
earldom
of
which
one
would
presume
the
coronets
to
be
a
sign
would
pass
to
his
son
would
seem
to
show
that
the
wearing
of
a
coronet
even
at
that
date
was
merely
indicative
of
high
nobility
of
birth
and
not
of
the
possession
of
a
substantive
parliamentary
peerage
in
spite
of
the
variations
in
form
coronets
were
however
a
necessity
when
both
dukes
and
earls
were
created
they
were
invested
with
a
coronet
in
open
parliament
as
time
went
on
the
coronet
however
gradually
came
to
be
considered
the
sign
of
the
possession
of
a
peerage
and
was
so
borne
but
it
was
not
until
the
reign
of
charles
ii
that
coronets
were
definitely
assigned
by
royal
warrant
february
to

the
coronet

is
exactly

that
instead
of
two
intersecting

it
has

illustration

given

the
usual

however
that
this

belongs
to
the
prince
as
eldest
son
of
the

and
to
the
throne
and
not

this

being

a
coronet
composed
alternately
of
and
strawberry
leaves
the
latter
taking
the
place
of
the
upon
the
circlet
of
the
royal
crown
this
coronet
was
also
assigned
in
the
warrant
of
february
charles
ii
it
will
be
observed
by
those
who
compare
one
heraldic
book
with
another
that
i
have
quoted
these
rules
differently
from
any
other
work
upon
the
subject
a
moment
thought
however
must
convince
any
one
of
the
accuracy
of
my
version
it
is
a
cardinal
rule
of
armory
that
save
for
the
single
circumstance
of
attainder
no
man
armorial
insignia
shall
be
degraded
whilst
any
man
status
may
be
increased
it
can
not
be
lessened
most
heraldic
books
quote
the
coronet
of
and
strawberry
leaves
as
the
coronet
of
the
grandsons
of
the
sovereign
whilst
the
coronet
of
and
strawberry
leaves
is
stated
to
be
the
coronet
of
nephews
or
cousins
of
the
sovereign
such
a
state
of
affairs
would
be
intolerable
because
it
would
mean
the
liability
at
any
moment
to
be
degraded
to
the
use
of
a
less
honourable
coronet
take
for
example
the
case
of
prince
arthur
of
connaught
during
the
lifetime
of
queen
victoria
as
a
grandson
of
the
sovereign
he
would
be
entitled
to
the
former
whereas
as
soon
as
king
edward
ascended
the
throne
he
would
have
been
forced
to
relinquish
it
in
favour
of
the
more
remote
form
the
real
truth
is
that
the
members
of
the
royal
family
do
not
inherit
these
coronets
as
a
matter
of
course
they
technically
and
in
fact
have
no
coronets
until
these
have
been
assigned
by
royal
warrant
with
the
arms
when
such
warrants
are
issued
the
coronets
assigned
have
up
to
the
present
time
conformed
to
the
above
rules
i
am
not
sure
that
the
rules
now
exist
in
any
more
potent
form
than
that
up
to
the
present
time
those
particular
patterns
happen
to
have
been
assigned
in
the
circumstances
stated
but
the
warrants
though
they
contain
no
hereditary
limitation
certainly
contain
no
clause
limiting
their
operation
to
the
lifetime
of
the
then
sovereign
which
they
certainly
would
do
if
the
coronet
only
existed
whilst
the
particular
relationship
continued
the
terms
grandson
of
the
sovereign
and
nephew
of
the
sovereign
which
are
usually
employed
are
not
correct
the
coronets
only
apply
to
the
children
of
the
children
of
princesses
who
are
undoubtedly
included
in
the
terms
grandson
and
nephew
are
not
technically
members
of
the
royal
family
nor
do
they
inherit
either
rank
or
coronet
from
their
mothers
by
a
curious
fatality
there
has
never
since
these
royal
coronets
were
differentiated
been
any
male
descendant
of
an
english
sovereign
more
remotely
related
than
a
nephew
with
the
exception
of
the
dukes
of
cumberland
their
succession
to
the
throne
of
hanover
renders
them
useless
as
a
precedent
inasmuch
as
their
right
to
arms
and
coronet
must
be
derived
from
hanover
and
its
laws
and
not
from
this
country
the
princess
frederica
of
hanover
however
uses
an
english
coronet
and
the
royal
arms
of
england
presumably
preferring
her
status
as
a
princess
of
this
country
to
whatever
hanoverian
status
might
be
claimed
it
is
much
to
be
wished
that
a
royal
warrant
should
be
issued
to
her
which
would
decide
the
point
at
present
in
doubt
as
to
what
degree
of
relationship
the
coronet
of
the
and
strawberry
leaves
is
available
for
or
failing
that
coronet
what
the
coronet
of
prince
or
princess
of
this
country
might
be
he
or
she
not
being
child
grandchild
or
nephew
or
niece
of
a
sovereign
the
unique
use
of
actual
coronets
in
england
at
the
occasion
of
each
coronation
ceremony
has
prevented
them
becoming
as
in
so
many
other

mere

case
of
a
grant
of
arms
to
a
peer
a
mural
coronet
is
only
granted
to
officers
in
the
army
of
the
rank
of
general
or
above
and
the
naval
coronet
is
only
granted
to
officers
in
his
majesty
royal
navy
of
the
rank
of
admiral
and
above
an
eastern
coronet
is
now
only
granted
in
the
case
of
those
of
high
position
in
one
or
other
of
the
imperial
services
who
have
served
in

and
the
east
the
granting
of
crests
issuing
from
the
other
forms
of
crest
coronets
the
and
the
crown
palisado
is
always
discouraged
but
no
rule
exists
denying
them
to
applicants
and
they
are
to
be
obtained
if
the
expectant
grantee
is
sufficiently
patient
importunate
and
pertinacious
neither
form
is
however
particularly
ornamental
and
both
are
of
modern
origin
there
is
still
yet
another
coronet
the
celestial
coronet
this
is
not
unusual
as
a
charge
but
as
a
coronet
from
which
a
crest
issues
i
know
of
no
instance
nor
am
i
aware
of
what
rules
if
any
govern
the
granting
of
it
definite
rank
coronets
have
been
in
times
past
granted
for
use
as
crest
coronets
but
this
practice
the
propriety
of
which
can
not
be
considered
as
other
than
highly
questionable
has
only
been
pursued
even
in
the
more
lax
days
which
are
past
on
rare
and
very
exceptional
occasions
and
has
long
since
been
definitely
abandoned
as
improper
in
considering
the
question
of
crest
coronets
the
presumption
that
they
originated
from
coronets
of
rank
at
once
jumps
to
the
mind
this
is
by
no
means
a
foregone
conclusion
it
is
difficult
to
say
what
is
the
earliest
instance
of
the
use
of
a
coronet
in
this
country
as
a
coronet
of
rank
when
it
is
remembered
that
the
coronet
of
a
baron
had
no
existence
whatever
until
it
was
called
into
being
by
a
warrant
of
charles
ii
after
the
restoration
and
that
differentiated
coronets
for
the
several
ranks
in
the
peerage
are
not
greatly
anterior
in
date
the
question
becomes
distinctly
complicated
from
certainly
the
reign
of
edward
the
confessor
the
kings
of
england
had
worn
crowns
and
the
great
territorial
earls
who
it
must
be
remembered
occupied
a
position
akin
to
that
of
a
petty
sovereign
far
beyond
the
mere
high
dignity
of
a
great
noble
at
the
present
day
from
an
early
period
wore
crowns
or
coronets
not
greatly
differing
in
appearance
from
the
crown
of
the
king
but
the
peerage
as
such
certainly
neither
had
nor
claimed
the
technical
right
to
a
coronet
as
a
mark
of
their
rank
in
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
centuries
but
coronets
of
a
kind
were
used
as
can
be
seen
from
early
effigies
long
before
the
use
of
crests
became
general
but
these
coronets
were
merely
in
the
nature
of
a
species
of
decoration
for
the
helmet
many
of
them
far
more
closely
resembling
a
jewelled
torse
than
a
coronet
parker
in
his
glossary
of
terms
used
in
heraldry
probably
correctly
represents
the
case
when
he
states
from
the
reign
of
edward
iii
coronets
of
various
forms
were
worn
as
it
seems
indiscriminately
by
princes
dukes
earls
and
even
knights
but
apparently
rather
by
way
of
ornament
than
distinction
or
if
for
distinction
only
like
the
collar
of
ss
as
a
mark
of
gentility
the
helmet
of
edward
the
black
prince
upon
his
effigy
at
canterbury
is
surrounded
with
a
coronet
totally
different
from
that
subsequently
assigned
to
his
rank
the
instance
quoted
by
parker
might
be
amplified
by
countless
others
but
it
may
here
with
advantage
be
pointed
out
that
the
great
helmet
or
as
this
probably
is
the
ceremonial
representation
of
it
suspended
above
the
prince
tomb
fig
has
no
coronet
and
the
crest
is
upon
a
chapeau
of
the
fourteen
instances
in
the
plantagenet
garter
plates
in
which
the
appears
twelve
were
peers
of
england
one
was
a
foreign
count
and
one
only
a
commoner
on
the
other
hand
of
whose
garter
plates
show
crests
issuing
from
coronets
four
are
foreigners
seven
are
commoners
and
eighteen
were
peers
the
coronets
show
very
great
variations
in
form
and
design
but
such
variations
appear
quite
capricious
and
to
carry
no
meaning
nor
does
it
seem
probable
that
a
coronet
of
gules
or
of
azure
of
which
there
are
ten
could
represent
a
coronet
of
rank
the
garter
plate
of
sir
william
de
la
pole
earl
of
afterwards
duke
of
suffolk
shows
his
crest
upon
a
narrow
black
fillet
consequently
whatever
may
be
the
conclusion
as
to
the
wearing
of
coronets
alone
it
would
seem
to
be
a
very
certain
conclusion
that
the
heraldic
crest
coronet
bore
no
relation
to
any
coronet
of
rank
or
to
the
right
to
wear
one
its
adoption
must
have
been
in
the
original
instance
and
probably
even
in
subsequent
generations
a
matter
of
pure
fancy
and
inclination
this
is
borne
out
by
the
fact
that
whilst
the
garter
plate
of
sir
henry
bourchier
earl
of
essex
shows
his
crest
upon
a
torse
his
effigy
represents
it
issuing
from
a
coronet
until
the
reign
of
henry
the
royal
crest
both
in
the
case
of
the
sovereign
and
all
the
other
members
of
the
royal
family
is
always
represented
upon
a
chapeau
or
cap
of
dignity
the
great
seal
of
edward
vi
shows
the
crest
upon
a
coronet
though
the
present
form
of
crown
and
crest
were
originated
by
queen
elizabeth
in
depicting
the
royal
arms
it
is
usual
to
omit
one
of
the
crowns
and
this
is
always
done
in
the
official
warrants
controlling
the
arms
one
crown
is
placed
upon
the
helmet
and
upon
this
crown
is
placed
the
crest
but
theoretically
the
royal
achievement
has
two
crowns
inasmuch
as
one
of
the
crowns
is
an
inseparable
part
of
the
crest
probably
the
finest
representation
of
the
royal
crest
which
has
ever
been
done
is
the
design
for
one
of
the
smaller
bookplates
for
the
windsor
castle
library
this
was
executed
by
eve
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
imagine
anything
finer
like
the
rest
of
the
royal
achievement
the
royal
crest
is
of
course
not
hereditary
and
consequently
it
is
assigned
by
a
royal
warrant
to
each
male
member
of
the
royal
family
and
the
opportunity
is
then
taken
to
substitute
for
the
royal
crown
which
is
a
part
of
the
sovereign
crest
a
coronet
identical
with
whatever
may
be
assigned
in
that
particular
instance
as
the
coronet
of
rank
in
the
case
of
royal
bastards
the
crest
has
always
been
assigned
upon
a
chapeau
the
only
case
which
comes
to
one
mind
in
which
the
royal
crown
has
outside
the
sovereign
been
allowed
as
a
crest
coronet
is
the
case
of
the
town
of
eye
the
royal
crown
of
scotland
is
the
crest
coronet
of
the
sovereign
crest
for
the
kingdom
of
scotland
this
crest
together
with
the
crest
of
ireland
is
never
assigned
to
any
member
of
the
royal
family
except
the
sovereign
the
crest
of
ireland
which
is
on
a
wreath
or
and
azure
is
by
the
way
confirmatory
evidence
that
the
crowns
in
the
crests
of
scotland
and
england
have
a
duplicate
and
separate
existence
apart
from
the
crown
denoting
the
sovereignty
of
the
realm
the
ordinary
crest
coronet
or
as
it
is
usually
termed
in
british
heraldry
the
ducal
coronet
ulster
however
describes
it
officially
as
a
ducal
crest
coronet
is
quite
a
separate
matter
from
a
duke
coronet
of
rank
whilst
the
coronet
of
a
duke
has
upon
the
rim
five
strawberry
leaves
visible
when
depicted
a
ducal
coronet
has
only
three
the
ducal
coronet
fig
is
the
conventional
regularised
development
of
the
crest
coronets
employed
in
early
times
unfortunately
it
has
in
many
instances
been
depicted
of
a
much
greater
and
very
unnecessary
width
the
result
being
inartistic
and
allowing
unnecessary
space
between
the
leaves
and
at
the
same
time
leaving
the
crest
and
coronet
with
little
circumferential
relation
it
should
be
noted
that
it
is
quite
incorrect
for
the
rim
of
the
coronet
to
be
jewelled
in
colour
though
the
outline
of
jewelling
is
indicated
illustration
fig
ducal
coronet
though
ducal
crest
coronets
are
no
longer
granted
of
course
they
are
still
exemplified
and
their
use
permitted
where
they
have
been
previously
granted
they
are
of
very
frequent
occurrence
in
older
grants
and
confirmations
it
is
quite
incorrect
to
depict
a
cap
as
in
a
coronet
of
rank
in
a
crest
coronet
which
is
never
more
than
the
metal
circlet
and
consequently
it
is
equally
incorrect
to
add
the
band
of
ermine
below
it
which
will
sometimes
be
seen
the
coronet
of
a
duke
has
in
one
or
two
isolated
cases
been
granted
as
a
crest
coronet
in
such
a
case
it
is
not
described
as
a
duke
coronet
but
as
a
ducal
coronet
of
five
leaves
it
so
occurs
in
the
case
of
the
colour
of
the
crest
coronet
must
be
stated
in
the
blazon
crest
coronets
are
of
all
colours
and
will
be
sometimes
found
bearing
charges
upon
the
rim
particularly
in
the
cases
of
mural
and
naval
coronets
an
instance
of
this
will
be
seen
in
the
case
of
sir
john
moore
and
of
mansergh
the
label
in
this
latter
case
being
an
unalterable
charge
and
not
the
difference
mark
of
an
eldest
son
though
the
tincture
of
the
coronet
ought
to
appear
in
the
blazon
nevertheless
it
is
always
a
fair
presumption
when
it
is
not
specified
that
it
is
of
gold
coronets
of
colours
being
very
much
less
frequently
met
with
on
this
point
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
some
of
the
cases
where
the
crest
coronet
is
figured
upon
an
early
garter
plate
as
of
colour
it
is
now
borne
gold
by
the
present
descendants
of
the
family
for
example
on
the
garter
plate
of
sir
walter
hungerford
lord
hungerford
the
crest
a
garb
or
between
two
silver
sickles
issues
from
a
coronet
azure
the
various
hungerford
families
now
bear
it
or
the
crest
upon
the
garter
plate
of
sir
humphrey
stafford
duke
of
buckingham
a
argent
beaked
gules
issues
from
a
coronet
gules
this
crest
as
it
is
now
borne
by
the
present
lord
stafford
is
out
of
a
ducal
coronet
per
pale
gules
and
sable
another
instance
of
coloured
coronets
will
be
found
in
the
crest
of
nicholson
now
borne
by
shaw
probably
however
the
most
curious
instance
of
all
will
be
found
in
the
case
of
a
crest
coronet
of
ermine
of
which
an
example
occurs
in
the
gelre
armorial
a
very
general
misconception
which
will
be
found
stated
in
practically
every
of
armory
is
that
when
a
crest
issues
from
a
coronet
the
wreath
must
be
omitted
there
is
not
and
never
has
been
any
such
rule
the
rule
is
rather
to
the
contrary
instances
where
both
occur
are
certainly
now
uncommon
and
the
presence
of
a
wreath
is
not
in
practice
considered
to
be
essential
if
a
coronet
occurs
but
the
use
or
absence
of
a
wreath
when
the
crest
issues
from
a
coronet
really
depends
entirely
upon
the
original
grant
if
no
wreath
is
specified
with
the
coronet
none
will
be
used
or
needed
but
if
both
are
granted
both
should
be
used
an
instance
of
the
use
of
both
will
be
found
on
the
garter
stall
plate
of
sir
walter
devereux
lord
ferrers
the
crest
a
talbot
head
silver
issues
from
a
coronet
or
which
is
placed
upon
a
torse
argent
and
sable
another
instance
will
be
found
in
the
case
of
the
grant
of
the
crest
of
hanbury
a
quite
recent
case
was
the
grant
by
sir
bernard
burke
ulster
king
of
arms
of
a
crest
to
sir
richard
quain
the
blazon
of
which
was
on
a
wreath
argent
and
azure
and
out
of
a
mural
coronet
proper
a
rampant
or
charged
on
the
shoulder
with
a
trefoil
slipped
vert
and
holding
between
the
paws
a
also
proper
the
blade
gold
other
instances
are
the
crests
of
hamilton
of
sunningdale
and
tarleton
another
instance
will
be
found
in
the
grant
to
possibly
this
blazon
may
be
a
clerical
error
in
the
engrossment
because
it
will
be
noticed
that
the
wreath
does
not
appear
in
the
emblazonment
plate
i
wonder
how
many
of
the
officers
of
arms
are
aware
of
the
existence
of
a
warrant
dated
in
issued
by
the
deputy
to
the
companies
of
painters
stainers
and
coachmakers
forbidding
them
to
paint
crests
which
issue
out
of
ducal
coronets
without
putting
them
upon
wreaths
of
their
colours
the
wording
of
the
warrant
very
plainly
shows
that
at
that
date
a
wreath
was
always
painted
below
a
crest
coronet
the
warrant
however
is
not
so
worded
that
it
can
be
accepted
as
determining
the
point
for
the
future
or
that
it
would
override
a
subsequent
grant
of
a
crest
in
contrary
form
but
it
is
evidence
of
what
the
law
then
was
no
crest
is
now
granted
without
either
wreath
coronet
or
chapeau
an
instance
of
the
use
of
the
coronet
of
a
marquess
as
a
crest
coronet
will
be
found
in
the
case
of
the
bentinck
crest
there
are
some
number
of
instances
of
the
use

somewhat
difficult
to

of

led
to
its
very
frequent
use
in

during

should

be

distinguish
between
the
battlements

in

it
is
very
usual
to
place
a
mural
crown
over
the
shield
of
a
town
and
some
remarks
upon
the
point
will
be
found
on

this
at
first
sight
may
seem
an
appropriate
practice
to
pursue
and
several
heraldic
artists
have
followed
it
and
advocate
it
in
this
country
but
the
correctness
of
such
a
practice
is
for
british
purposes
strongly
and
emphatically
denied
officially
and
whilst
we
reserve
this
privilege
for
grants
to
certain
army
officers
of
high
rank
it
does
not
seem
proper
that
it
should
be
available
for
casual
and
haphazard
assumption
by
a
town
or
city
that
being
the
case
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
practice
is
not
permissible
in
british
armory
the
naval
coronet
fig
though
but
seldom
granted

very
popular
at
one
time
in
the

eighteenth
and
the
early
part
of
the
nineteenth
centuries
naval
actions
were
constantly
being
fought
and
in
a
large
number
of
cases
where
the
action
of
the
officer
in
command
was
worthy
of
high
praise
and
reward
part
of
such
reward
was
usually
an
augmentation
of
arms
very
frequently
it
is
found
that
the
crest
of
augmentation
issued
from
a
naval
coronet
this
is
as
will
be
seen
a
curious
figure
composed
of
the
sail
and
stern
of
a
ship
repeated
and
alternating
on
the
rim
of
a
circlet
sometimes
it
is
entirely
gold
but
usually
the
sails
are
argent
an
instance
of
such
a
grant

will
be

of

to
have
been

coronet
other
names
for
the
chapeau
under
which
it
is
equally
well
known
are
the
cap
of
maintenance
or
cap
of
dignity
there
can
be
very
little
doubt
that
the
heraldic
chapeau
combines
two
distinct
origins
or
earlier
prototypes
the
one
is
the
real
cap
of
dignity
and
the
other
is
the
hat
or
capelot
which
covered
the
top
of
the
helm
before
the
mantling
was
introduced
but
from
which
the
lambrequin
developed
the
curious
evolution
of
the
chapeau
from
the
capelot
which
is
so
marked
and
usual
in
germany
is
the
tall
conical
hat
often
surmounted
by
a
tuft
or
larger
plume
of
feathers
and
usually
employed
in
german
heraldry
as
an
opportunity
for
the
repetition
of
the
livery
colours
or
a
part
of
and
often
the
whole
design
of
the
arms
but
it
should
at
the
same
time
be
noticed
that
this
tall
conical
hat
is
much
more
closely
allied
to
the
real
cap
of
maintenance
than
our
present
crest
chapeau
exactly
what
purpose
the
real
cap
of
maintenance
served
or
of
what
it
was
a
symbol
remains
to
a
certain
extent
a
matter
of
mystery
the
cap
of
maintenance
a
part
of
the
regalia
borne
before
the
sovereign
at
the
state
opening
of
parliament
but
at
a
coronation
by
the
marquesses
of
winchester
the
hereditary
bearers
of
the
cap
of
maintenance
bears
in
its
shape
no
relation
to
the
heraldic
chapeau
the
only
similarity
is
its
crimson
colour
and
its
lining
of
ermine
it
is
a
tall
conical
cap
and
is
carried
on
a
short
staff
illustration
fig
the
crown
of
king
charles
ii
whilst
crest
coronets
in
early
days
appear
to
have
had
little
or
no
relation
to
titular
rank
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
caps
of
dignity
had
long
before
a
coronet
was
assigned
to
the
rank
of
baron
in
the
reign
of
charles
ii
all
barons
had
their
caps
of
dignity
of
scarlet
lined
with
white
fur
and
in
the
old
pedigrees
a
scarlet
cap
with
a
gold
tuft
or
tassel
on
top
and
a
lining
of
fur
will
be
found
painted
above
the
arms
of
a
baron
this
fact
the
fact
that
until
after
stuart
days
the
chapeau
does
not
appear
to
have
been
allowed
or
granted
to
others
than
peers
the
fact
that
it
is
now
reserved
for
the
crests
granted
to
peers
the
fact
that
the
velvet
cap
is
a
later
addition
both
to
the
sovereign
crown
and
to
the
coronet
of
a
peer
and
finally
the
fact
that
the
cap
of
maintenance
is
borne
before
the
sovereign
only
in
the
precincts
of
parliament
would
seem
to
indubitably
indicate
that
the
cap
of
maintenance
was
inseparably
connected
with
the
lordship
and
overlordship
of
parliament
vested
in
peers
and
in
the
sovereign
in
the
crumpled
and
tasselled
top
of
the
velvet
cap
and
in
the
ermine
border
visible
below
the
rim
the
high
conical
form
of
the
cap
of
maintenance
proper
can
be
still
traced
in
the
cap
of
a
coronet
and
that
the
velvet
cap
contained
in
the
crown
of
the
sovereign
and
in
the
coronet
of
a
peer
is
the
survival
of
the
old
cap
of
dignity
there
can
be
no
doubt
this
is
perhaps
even
more
apparent
in
fig
which
shows
the
crown
of
king
charles
than
in
the
representations
of
the
royal
crown
which
we
are
more
accustomed
to
see
the
present
form
of
a
peer
coronet
is
undoubtedly
the
conjoining
of
two
separate
emblems
of
his
rank
the
cap
of
maintenance
or
dignity
however
as
represented
above
the
arms
of
a
baron
as
above
referred
to
was
not
of
this
high
conical
shape
it
was
much
flatter
the
high
conical
original
shape
is
however
preserved
in
many
of
the
early
heraldic
representations
of
the
chapeau
as
will
be
noticed
from
an
examination
of
the
ancient
garter
plates
or
from
a
reference
to
fig
which
shows
the
helmet
with
its
crest
of
edward
the
black
prince
illustration
fig
the
chapeau
of
the
chapeaux
upon
which
crests
are
represented
in
the
early
garter
plates
the
following
facts
may
be
observed
they
are
twenty
in
number
of
the
plates
reproduced
in
john
hope
book
it
should
be
noticed
that
until
the
end
of
the
reign
of
henry
viii
the
royal
crest
of
the
sovereign
was
always
depicted
upon
a
chapeau
gules
lined
with
ermine
of
the
twenty
instances
in
which
the
chapeau
appears
no
less
than
twelve
are
representations
of
the
royal
crest
borne
by
closely
allied
relatives
of
the
sovereign
so
that
we
have
only
eight
examples
from
which
to
draw
deductions
but
of
the
twenty
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
nineteen
are
peers
and
the
only
remaining
instance
sir
john
grey
is
that
of
the
eldest
son
and
heir
apparent
of
a
peer
both
shield
and
crest
being
in
this
case
boldly
marked
with
the
label
of
an
eldest
son
consequently
it
is
a
safe
deduction
that
whatever
may
have
been
the
regulations
and
customs
concerning
the
use
of
coronets
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
down
to
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
the
use
of
a
chapeau
marked
a
crest
as
that
of
a
peer
of
the
eight
examples
one
has
been
repainted
and
is
valueless
as
a
contemporary
record
of
the
remaining
seven
four
are
of
the
conventional
gules
and
ermine
one
only
has
not
the
ermine
lining
that
being
the
crest
of
lord
fanhope
it
is
plainly
the
royal
crest
differenced
he
being
of
royal
but
illegitimate
descent
and
probably
the
argent
in
lieu
of
ermine
lining
is
one
of
the
intentional
marks
of
distinction
the
chapeau
of
lord
beaumont
is
azure
lined
ermine
and
that
of
the
earl
of
douglas
is
azure
lined
ermine
this
being
in
each
case
in
conformity
with
the
mantling
whilst
the
beaumont
family
still
use
this
curiously
coloured
chapeau
with
their
crest
the
douglas
crest
is
now
borne
by
the
duke
of
hamilton
upon
one
of
ordinary
tinctures
chapeaux
other
than
of
gules
lined
ermine
are
but
rarely
met
with
and
unless
specifically
blazoned
to
the
contrary
a
cap
of
maintenance
is
always
presumed
to
be
gules
and
ermine
about
the
stuart
period
the
granting
of
crests
upon
chapeaux
to
others
than
peers
became
far
from
unusual
and
the
practice
appears
to
have
been
frequently
adopted
prior
to
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
some
of
these
crest
chapeaux
however
were
not
of
gules
an
instance
of
this
kind
will
be
found
in
the
grant
in
to
sir
thomas
davies
then
one
of
the
sheriffs
of
the
city
of
london
but
afterwards
in
lord
mayor
the
crest
granted
was
on
a
chapeau
sable
turned
up
or
a
rampant
of
the
last
the
reason
for
the
grant
at
that
date
of
such
a
simple
crest
and
the
even
more
astonishingly
simple
coat
of
arms
or
a
chevron
between
three
mullets
pierced
sable
has
always
been
a
mystery
to
me
the
arms
of
lord
lurgan
granted
or
confirmed
afford
another
instance
of
a
chapeau
of
unusual
colour
his
crest
being
upon
a
chapeau
azure
turned
up
ermine
a
greyhound
statant
gules
collared
or
there
are
some
number
of
cases
in
which
peers
whose
ancestors
originally
bore
their
crests
upon
a
wreath
have
subsequently
placed
them
upon
a
chapeau
the
stanleys
earls
of
derby
are
a
case
in
point
as
are
also
the
marquesses
of
exeter
the
latter
case
is
curious
because
although
they
have
for
long
enough
so
depicted
their
crest
they
only
comparatively
recently
within
the
last
few
years
obtained
the
necessary
authorisation
by
the
crown
at
the
present
time
the
official
form
of
the
chapeau
is
as
in
fig
with
the
turn
up
split
at
the
back
into
two
tails
no
such
form
can
be
found
in
any
early
representation
and
most
heraldic
artists
have
now
reverted
to
an
earlier
type
before
leaving
the
subject
of
the
cap
of
maintenance
reference
should
be
made
to
another
instance
of
a
curious
heraldic
headgear
often
but
styled
a
cap
of
maintenance
this
is
the
fur
cap
invariably
used
over
the
shields
of
the
cities
of
london
dublin
and
norwich
there
is
no
english
official
authority
whatever
for
such
an
addition
to
the
arms
but
there
does
appear
to
be
some
little
official
recognition
of
it
in
ulster
office
in
the
case
of
the
city
of
dublin
the
late
ulster
king
of
arms
however
informed
me
that
he
would
in
the
case
of
dublin
have
no
hesitation
whatever
in
certifying
the
right
of
the
city
arms
to
be
so
displayed
plate
in
the
utter
absence
of
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
precedent
it
is
quite
unlikely
that
the
practice
will
be
sanctioned
in
england
the
hat
used
is
a
brown
fur
hat
of
the
shape
depicted
with
the
arms
of
the
city
of
dublin
it
is
merely
in
london
a
part
of
the
official
uniform
or
livery
of
the
city
it
does
not
even
appear
to
have
been
a
part
of
the
costume
of
the
lord
mayor
and
it
must
always
remain
a
mystery
why
it
was
ever
adopted
for
heraldic
use
but
then
the
chain
of
the
lord
mayor
of
london
is
generally
called
a
collar
of
ss
besides
this
the
city
of
london
uses
a
peer
helmet
a
bogus
modern
crest
and
even
more
modern
bogus
supporters
so
a
few
other
eccentricities
need
not
in

particular

chapter
xxiv
the
mantling
or
lambrequin
the
mantling
is
the
ornamental
design
which
in
a
representation
of
an
armorial
achievement
depends
from
the
helmet
falling
away
on
either
side
of
the
escutcheon
many
authorities
have
considered
it
to
have
been
no
more
than
a
fantastic
series
of
flourishes
devised
by
artistic
minds
for
the
purpose
of
assisting
ornamentation
and
affording
an
artistic
opportunity
of
filling
up
unoccupied
spaces
in
a
heraldic
design
there
is
no
doubt
that
its
readily
apparent
advantages
in
that
character
have
greatly
led
to
the
importance
now
attached
to
the
mantling
in
heraldic
art
but
equally
is
it
certain
that
its
real
origin
is
to
be
traced
elsewhere
the
development
of
the
heraldry
of
was
in
the
east
during
the
period
of
the
crusades
and
the
burning
heat
of
the
eastern
sun
upon
the
metal
helmet
led
to
the
introduction
and
adoption
of
a
textile
covering
which
would
act
in
some
way
as
a
barrier
between
the
two
it
was
simply
in
fact
and
effect
a
primeval
prototype
of
the
puggaree
of
margate
and
hindustan
it
is
plain
from
all
early
representations
that
originally
it
was
short
simply
hanging
from
the
apex
of
the
helmet
to
the
level
of
the
shoulders
overlapping
the
textile
tunic
or
coat
of
arms
but
probably
enveloping
a
greater
part
of
the
helmet
neck
and
shoulders
than
we
are
at
present
judging
from
pictorial
representations
inclined
to
believe
adopted
first
as
a
protection
against
the
heat
and
perhaps
also
the
rust
which
would
follow
damp
the
lambrequin
soon
made
evident
another
of
its
advantages
an
advantage
to
which
we
doubtless
owe
its
perpetuation
outside
eastern
warfare
in
the
more
temperate
climates
of
northern
europe
and
england
textile
fabrics
are
peculiarly
and
remarkably
deadening
to
a
to
which
fact
must
be
added
the
facility
with
which
such
a
weapon
would
become
entangled
in
the
hanging
folds
of
cloth
the
hacking
and
hewing
of
battle
would
show
itself
plainly
upon
the
lambrequin
of
one
accustomed
to
a
prominent
position
in
the
forefront
of
a
fight
and
the
honourable
record
implied
by
a
ragged
and
slashed
lambrequin
accounts
for
the
fact
that
we
find
at
an
early
period
after
their
introduction
into
heraldic
art
that
mantlings
are
depicted
cut
and
torn
to
ribbons
this
opportunity
was
quickly
seized
by
the
heraldic
artist
who
has
always
from
those
very
earliest
times
of
absolute
armorial
freedom
down
to
the
point
of
greatest
and
most
regularised
control
been
allowed
an
entire
and
absolute
discretion
in
the
design
to
be
adopted
for
the
mantling
hence
it
is
that
we
find
so
much
importance
is
given
to
it
by
heraldic
artists
for
it
is
in
the
design
of
the
mantling
and
almost
entirely
in
that
opportunity
that
the
personal
character
and
abilities
of
the
artist
have
their
greatest
scope
some
authorities
have
however
derived
the
mantling
from
the
robe
of
estate
and
there
certainly
has
been
a
period
in
british
armory
when
most
lambrequins
found
in
heraldic
art
are
represented
by
an
unmutilated
cloth
suspended
from
and
displayed
behind
the
armorial
bearings
and
tied
at
the
upper
corners
in
all
probability
the
robes
of
estate
of
the
higher
nobility
no
less
than
the
then
existing
and
peremptorily
enforced
sumptuary
laws
may
have
led
to
the
desire
and
to
the
attempt
at
a
period
when
the
actual
lambrequin
was
fast
disappearing
from
general
knowledge
to
display
arms
upon
something
which
should
represent
either
the
parliamentary
robes
of
estate
of
a
peer
or
the
garments
of
rich
fabric
which
the
sumptuary
laws
forbade
to
those
of
humble
degree
to
this
period
undoubtedly
belongs
the
term
mantling
which
is
so
much
more
frequently
employed
than
the
word
lambrequin
which
is
really
from
the
armorial
point
of
view
the
older
term
the
heraldic
mantling
was
of
course
originally
the
representation
of
the
actual
capeline
or
textile
covering
worn
upon
the
helmet
but
many
early
heraldic
representations
are
of
mantlings
which
are
of
skin
fur
or
feathers
being
in
such
cases
invariably
a
continuation
of
the
crest
drawn
out
and
represented
as
the
lambrequin
when
the
crest
was
a
part
of
the
human
figure
the
habit
in
which
that
figure
was
arrayed
is
almost
invariably
found
to
have
been
so
employed
the
garter
plate
of
sir
ralph
bassett
one
of
the
founder
knights
shows
the
crest
as
a
black
head
the
skin
being
continued
as
the
sable
mantling
some
sclavonic
families
have
mantlings
of
fur
only
that
of
the
hungarian
family
of
chorinski
is
a
bear
skin
and
countless
other
instances
can
be
found
of
the
use
by
german
families
of
a
continuation
of
the
crest
for
a
mantling
this
practice
affords
instances
of
many
curious
mantlings
this
in
one
case
in
the
zurich
being
the
scaly
skin
of
a
salmon
the
mane
of
the
lion
the
crest
of
mertz
and
the
hair
and
beard
of
the
crests
of
bohn
and
landschaden
are
similarly
continued
to
do
duty
for
the
mantling
this
practice
has
never
found
great
favour
in
england
the
cases
amongst
the
early
garter
plates
where
it
has
been
followed
standing
almost
alone
in
a
manuscript
of
the
reign
of
henry
now
in
the
college
of
arms
probably
dating
from
about
an
instance
of
this
character
can
be
found
however
it
is
a
representation
of
the
crest
of
stourton
fig
as
it
was
borne
at
that
date
and
was
a
black
benedictine
proper
holding
erect
in
his
dexter
hand
a
scourge
here
the
proper
black
benedictine
habit
it
has
of
later
years
been
corrupted
into
the
russet
habit
of
a
friar
is
continued
to
form
the
mantling
plate
vii
illustration
illustration
fig
the
crest
of
stourton
by
what
rules
the
colours
of
the
mantlings
were
decided
in
early
times
it
is
impossible
to
say
no
rules
have
been
handed
down
to
us
the
old
heraldic
books
are
silent
on
the
point
and
it
seems
equally
hopeless
to
attempt
to
deduce
any
from
ancient
armorial
examples
the
one
fact
that
can
be
stated
with
certainty
is
that
the
rules
of
early
days
if
there
were
any
are
not
the
rules
presently
observed
some
hold
that
the
colours
of
the
mantling
were
decided
by
the
colours
of
the
actual
livery
in
use
as
distinct
from
the
livery
colours
of
the
arms
it
is
difficult
to
check
this
rule
because
our
knowledge
of
the
liveries
in
use
in
early
days
is
so
meagre
and
limited
but
in
the
few
instances
of
which
we
now
have
knowledge
we
look
in
vain
for
a
repetition
of
the
colours
worn
by
the
retainers
as
liveries
in
the
mantlings
used
the
fact
that
the
livery
colours
are
represented
in
the
background
of
some
of
the
early
garter
plates
and
that
in
such
instances
in
no
single
case
do
they
agree
with
the
colours
of
the
mantling
must
certainly
dissipate
once
and
for
all
any
such
supposition
as
far
as
it
relates
to
that
period
a
careful
study
and
analysis
of
early
heraldic
emblazonment
however
reveals
one
point
as
a
dominating
characteristic
that
is
that
where
the
crest
by
its
nature
lent
itself
to
a
continuation
into
the
mantling
it
generally
was
so
continued
this
practice
which
was
almost
universal
upon
the
continent
and
is
particularly
to
be
met
with
in
german
heraldry
though
seldom
adopted
in
england
certainly
had
some
weight
in
english
heraldry
in
the
recently
published
reproductions
of
the
plantagenet
garter
plates
armorial
achievements
are
included
of
these
in
ten
instances
the
mantlings
are
plainly
continuations
of
the
crests
being
feathered
or
in
unison
fifteen
of
the
mantlings
have
both
the
outside
and
the
inside
of
the
principal
colour
and
of
the
principal
metal
of
the
arms
they
accompany
though
in
a
few
cases
contrary
to
the
present
practice
the
metal
is
outside
the
lining
being
of
the
colour
nineteen
more
of
the
mantlings
are
of
the
principal
colour
of
the
arms
the
majority
eighteen
of
these
being
lined
with
ermine
no
less
than
are
of
some
colour
lined
with
ermine
but
of
these
are
of
gules
lined
ermine
and
in
the
large
majority
of
cases
in
these
instances
neither
the
gules
nor
the
ermine
are
in
conformity
with
the
principal
colour
and
metal
what
we
now
term
the
livery
colours
of
the
arms
in
some
cases
the
colours
of
the
mantling
agree
with
the
colours
of
the
crest
a
rule
which
will
usually
be
found
to
hold
good
in
german
heraldry
the
constant
occurrence
of
gules
and
ermine
incline
one
much
to
believe
that
the
colours
of
the
mantling
were
not
decided
by
haphazard
fancy
but
that
there
was
some
law
possibly
in
some
way
connected
with
the
sumptuary
laws
of
the
period
which
governed
the
matter
or
at
any
rate
which
greatly
limited
the
range
of
selection
of
the
mantlings
excluding
those
which
are
gules
lined
ermine
there
are
four
only
the
colours
of
which
apparently
bear
no
relation
whatever
to
the
colours
of
the
arms
or
the
crests
appearing
upon
the
same
stall
plate
in
some
number
of
the
plates
the
colours
certainly
are
taken
from
a
quartering
other
than
the
first
one
and
in
one
at
least
of
the
four
exceptions
the
mantling
one
of
the
most
curious
examples
is
plainly
derived
from
a
quartering
inherited
by
the
knight
in
question
though
not
shown
upon
the
stall
plate
probably
a
closer
examination
of
the
remaining
three
instances
would
reveal
a
similar
reason
in
each
case
that
any
law
concerning
the
colours
of
their
mantlings
was
enforced
upon
those
concerned
would
be
an
unwarrantable
deduction
not
justified
by
the
instances
under
examination
but
one
is
clearly
justified
in
drawing
from
these
cases
some
deductions
as
to
the
practice
pursued
it
is
evident
that
unless
one
was
authorised
by
the
rule
or
reason
governing
the
matter
whatever
such
rule
or
reason
may
have
been
in
using
a
mantling
of
gules
and
ermine
the
dominating
colour
not
as
a
rule
the
metal
of
the
coat
of
arms
or
of
one
of
the
quarterings
or
sometimes
of
the
crest
if
the
tinctures
of
arms
and
crest
were
not
in
unison
decided
the
colour
of
the
mantling
that
there
was
some
meaning
behind
the
mantlings
of
gules
lined
with
ermine
there
can
be
little
doubt
for
it
is
noticeable
that
in
a
case
in
which
the
colours
of
the
arms
themselves
are
gules
and
ermine
the
mantling
is
of
gules
and
argent
as
by
the
way
in
this
particular
case
is
the
chapeau
upon
which
the
crest
is
placed
but
probably
the
reason
which
governed
these
mantlings
of
gules
lined
with
ermine
as
also
the
ermine
linings
of
other
mantlings
must
be
sought
outside
the
strict
limits
of
armory
that
the
colours
of
mantlings
are
repeated
in
different
generations
and
in
the
plates
of
members
of
the
same
family
clearly
demonstrates
that
selection
was
not
haphazard

these

whilst
one
can
call
to
mind
no
instance
of
importance
of
ancient
date
where
this
practice
has
been
followed
in
this
country
there
are
one
or
two
instances
in
the
garter
plates
which
approximate
closely
to
it
the
mantling
of
john

those
of

lord

of

of
gules

evidently
derived
from
the
quartering
for

being
gules

a

or
according
to
a
of

college
of

the
warrens
used
a
mantling
chequy
of
azure
and
or
with
their
arms
a
somewhat
similar
result
is
obtained
by
the
mantling
gules
semé
of
lozenges
or
upon
the
small

of
sir
sanchet

the

of

the

on

the

the

there
are
a
few
cases
amongst
the
garter
plates
in
which
badges
are
plainly
and
unmistakably
depicted
upon
the
mantlings
thus
on
the
lining
of
the
mantling
on
the
plate
of
sir
henry
bourchier
elected
will
be
found
which
are
repeated
on
a
fillet
round
the
head
of
the

the

plate
of

john
bourchier
lord

above
referred
to

is
lined
with
silver
on
the
dexter
side
semé
in
the
upper
part
with
and
in
the
lower
part
with
bourchier
knots
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
mantling
the
knots
are
in
the
upper
part
and
the
below
that
these
badges
upon
the
mantling
are
not
haphazard
artistic
decoration
is
proved
by
a
reference
to
the
monumental
effigy
of
the
earl
of
essex
in
little
easton
church
essex
the
differing
shapes
of
the
helmet
and
of
the
coronet
and
the
mantling
and
the
different
representation
of
the
crest
show
that
although
depicted
in
his
garter
robes
upon
his
effigy
the
helmet
crest
and
mantling
upon
which
the
earl
head
there
rests
and
the
representations
of
the
same
upon
the
garter
plate
are
not
slavish
copies
of
the
same
original
model
nevertheless
upon
the
effigy
as
on
the
garter
plate
we
find
the
outside
of
the
mantling
semé
of
billets
and
the
inside
semé
of
another
instance
amongst
the
garter
plates
will
be
found
in
the
case
of
viscount
lovell
whose
mantling
is
strewn
with
gold
padlocks
nearly
all
the
mantlings
on
the
garter
stall
plates
are
more
or
less
heavily
veined
with
gold
and
many
are
heavily
diapered
and
decorated
with
floral
devices
so
prominent
is
some
of
this
floral
diapering
that
one
is
inclined
to
think
that
in
a
few
cases
it
may
possibly
be
a
diapering
with
floral
badges
in
other
cases
it
is
equally
evidently
no
more
than
a
mere
accessory
of
design
though
between
these
two
classes
of
diapering
it
would
be
by
no
means
easy
to
draw
a
line
of
distinction
the
veining
and
heightening
of
a
mantling
with
gold
is
at
the
present
day
nearly
always
to
be
seen
in
elaborate
heraldic
painting
from
the
garter
plates
of
the
fourteenth
century
it
has
been
shown
that
the
colours
of
a
large
proportion
of
the
mantlings
approximated
in
early
days
to
the
colours
of
the
arms
the
popularity
of
gules
however
was
then
fast
encroaching
upon
the
frequency
of
appearance
which
other
colours
should
have
enjoyed
and
in
the
sixteenth
century
in
grants
and
other
paintings
of
arms
the
use
of
a
mantling
of
gules
had
become
practically
universal
in
most
cases
the
mantling
of
gules
doubled
argent
forms
an
integral
part
of
the
terms
of
the
grant
itself
as
sometimes
do
the
gold
tassels
which
are
so
frequently
found
terminating
the
mantlings
of
that
and
an
earlier
period
this
custom
continued
through
the
stuart
period
and
though
dropped
officially
in
england
during
the
eighteenth
century
when
the
mantling
reverted
to
the
livery
colours
of
the
arms
and
became
in
this
form
a
matter
of
course
and
so
understood
not
being
expressed
in
the
wording
of
the
patent
it
continued
in
force
in
lyon
office
in
scotland
until
the
year
when
the
present
lyon
king
of
arms
sir
james
balfour
paul
altered
the
practice
and
as
had
earlier
been
done
in
england
ordered
that
all
future
scottish
mantlings
should
be
depicted
in
the
livery
colours
of
the
arms
but
in
scotland
the
mantlings
though
now
following
the
livery
colours
are
still
included
in
the
terms
of
the
grant
and
thereby
stereotyped
in
england
in
an
official
exemplification
at
the
present
day
of
an
ancient
coat
of
arms
in
an
exemplification
following
the
assumption
of
name
and
arms
by
royal
license
the
mantling
is
painted
in
the
livery
colours
irrespective
of
any
ancient
patent
in
which
gules
and
argent
may
have
been
as
the
colour
of
the
mantling
though
probably
most
people
will
agree
as
to
the
expediency
of
such
a
practice
it
is
at
any
rate
open
to
criticism
on
the
score
of
propriety
unless
the
new
mantling
is
expressed
in
terms
in
the
new
patent
this
would
of
course
amount
to
a
grant
overriding
the
earlier
one
and
would
do
all
that
was
necessary
but
failing
this
there
appears
to
be
a
distinct
hiatus
in
the
continuity
of
authority
ermine
linings
to
the
mantling
were
soon
denied
to
the
undistinguished
commoner
and
with
the
exception
of
the
early
garter
plates
it
would
be
difficult
to
point
to
an
instance
of
their
use
the
mantlings
of
peers
however
continued
to
be
lined
with
ermine
and
english
instances
under
official
sanction
can
be
found
in
the
visitation
books
and
in
the
garter
plates
until
a
comparatively
recent
period
in
fact
the
relegation
of
peers
to
the
ordinary
livery
colours
for
their
mantlings
is
in
england
quite
a
modern
practice
in
scotland
however
the
mantlings
of
peers
have
always
been
lined
with
ermine
and
the
present
lyon
continues
this
whilst
usually
making
the
colours
of
the
outside
of
the
mantlings
agree
with
the
principal
colour
of
the
arms
this
as
regards
the
outer
colour
of
the
mantling
is
not
a
fixed
or
stereotyped
rule
and
in
some
cases
lyon
has
preferred
to
adopt
a
mantling
of
gules
lined
with
ermine
as
more
comformable
to
a
parliamentary
robe
of
estate
in
the
deputy
warrant
referred
to
on
page
are
some
interesting
points
as
to
the
mantling
it
is
recited
that
some
persons
under
degree
of
nobilitie
of
this
realme
doe
cause
ermins
to
be
depicted
upon
ye
lineings
of
those
mantles
which
are
used
with
their
armes
and
also
that
there
are
some
that
have
lately
caused
the
mantles
of
their
armes
to
be
painted
like
ostrich
feathers
as
tho
they
were
of
some
peculiar
and
superior
degree
of
honor
and
the
warrant
commands
that
these
points
are
to
be
rectified
the
royal
mantling
is
of
cloth
of
gold
in
the
case
of
the
sovereign
and
the
prince
of
wales
it
is
lined
with
ermine
and
for
other
members
of
the
royal
family
it
is
lined
with
argent
queen
elizabeth
was
the
first
sovereign
to
adopt
the
golden
mantling
the
royal
tinctures
before
that
date
for
the
mantling
being
gules
lined
ermine
the
mantling
of
or
and
ermine
has
of
course
since
that
date
been
rigidly
denied
to
all
outside
the
royal
family
two
instances
however
occur
amongst
the
early
garter
plates
viz
sir
john
grey
de
ruthyn
and
frederick
duke
of
urbino
it
is
sometimes
stated
that
a
mantling
of
or
and
ermine
is
a
sign
of
sovereignty
but
the
mantling
of
our
own
sovereign
is
really
the
only
case
in
which
it
is
presently
so
used
in
sweden
as
in
scotland
the
colours
of
the
mantling
are
specified
in
the
patent
and
unlike
our
own
are
often
curiously
varied
the
present
rules
for
the
colour
of
a
mantling
are
as
follows
in
england
and
ireland
that
with
ancient
arms
of
which
the
grant
specified
the
colour
where
this
has
not
been
altered
by
a
subsequent
exemplification
the
colours
must
be
as
stated
in
the
grant
usually
gules
lined
argent
that
the
mantling
of
the
sovereign
and
prince
of
wales
is
of
cloth
of
gold
lined
with
ermine
that
the
mantling
of
other
members
of
the
royal
family
is
of
cloth
of
gold
lined
with
argent
that
the
mantlings
of
all
other
people
shall
be
of
the
livery
colours
the
rules
in
scotland
are
now
as
follows
that
in
the
cases
of
peers
whose
arms
were
matriculated
before
the
mantling
is
of
gules
lined
with
ermine
the
scottish
term
for
lined
is
doubled
that
the
mantlings
of
all
other
arms
matriculated
before
shall
be
of
gules
and
argent
that
the
mantlings
of
peers
whose
arms
have
been
matriculated
since
shall
be
either
of
the
principal
colour
of
the
arms
lined
with
ermine
or
of
gules
lined
ermine
conformably
to
the
parliamentary
robe
of
estate
of
a
peer
as
may
happen
to
have
been
matriculated
that
the
mantlings
of
all
other
persons
whose
arms
have
been
matriculated
since
shall
be
of
the
livery
colours
unless
other
colours
are
as
is
occasionally
the
case
specified
in
the
patent
of
matriculation
whether
in
scotland
a
person
is
entitled
to
assume
of
his
own
motion
an
ermine
lining
to
his
mantling
upon
his
elevation
to
the
peerage
without
a
rematriculation
in
cases
where
the
arms
and
mantling
have
been
otherwise
matriculated
at
an
earlier
date
or
whether
in
england
any
peer
may
still
line
his
mantling
with
ermine
are
points
on
which
one
hesitates
to
express
an
opinion
when
the
mantling
is
of
the
livery
colours
the
following
rules
must
be
observed
the
outside
must
be
of
some
colour
and
the
lining
of
some
metal
the
colour
must
be
the
principal
colour
of
the
arms
the
colour
of
the
field
if
it
be
of
colour
or
if
it
is
of
metal
then
the
colour
of
the
principal
ordinary
or
charge
upon
the
shield
the
metal
will
be
as
the
field
if
the
field
is
of
metal
or
if
not
it
will
be
as
the
metal
of
the
principal
ordinary
or
charge
in
other
words
it
should
be
the
same
tinctures
as
the
wreath
if
the
field
is
party
of
colour
and
metal
per
pale
barry
quarterly
then
that
colour
and
that
metal
are
the
livery
colours
if
the
field
is
party
of
two
the
principal
colour
the
one
first
mentioned
in
the
blazon
is
taken
as
the
colour
and
the
other
is
ignored
the
mantling
is
made
party
to
agree
with
the
field
in
british
heraldry
as
would
be
the
case
in
germany
if
the
field
is
of
a
fur
then
the
dominant
metal
or
colour
of
the
fur
is
taken
as
one
component
part
of
the
livery
colours
the
other
metal
or
colour
required
being
taken
from
the
next
most
important
tincture
of
the
field
for
example
ermine
a
fess
gules
has
a
mantling
of
gules
and
argent
whilst
or
a
chevron
ermines
would
need
a
mantling
of
sable
and
or
the
mantling
for
azure
a
lion
rampant
erminois
would
be
azure
and
or
but
in
a
coat
showing
fur
metal
and
colour
sometimes
the
fur
is
ignored
a
field
of
vair
has
a
mantling
argent
and
azure
but
if
the
charge
be
vair
the
field
will
supply
the
one
either
colour
or
metal
whilst
the
vair
supplies
whichever
is
lacking
except
in
the
cases
of
scotsmen
who
are
peers
and
of
the
sovereign
and
prince
of
wales
no
fur
is
ever
used
nowadays
in
great
britain
for
a
mantling
in
cases
where
the
principal
charge
is
proper
a
certain
discretion
must
be
used
usually
the
heraldic
colour
to
which
the
charge
approximates
is
used
for
example
argent
issuing
from
a
mount
in
base
a
tree
proper
would
have
a
mantling
vert
and
argent
the
arms
or
three
cornish
choughs
proper
or
argent
three
negroes
heads
couped
proper
would
have
mantlings
respectively
sable
and
or
and
sable
and
argent
occasionally
one
comes
across
a
coat
which
supplies
an
impossible
mantling
or
which
does
not
supply
one
at
all
such
a
coat
would
be
per
bend
sinister
ermine
and
erminois
a
lion
rampant
counterchanged
here
there
is
no
colour
at
all
so
the
mantling
would
be
gules
and
argent
argent
three
stags
trippant
proper
would
have
a
mantling
gules
and
argent
a
coat
of
arms
with
a
landscape
field
would
also
probably
be
supplied
in
default
of
a
chief
supplying
other
colours
and
tinctures
with
a
mantling
gules
and
argent
it
is
quite
permissible
to
vein
a
mantling
with
gold
lines
this
being
always
done
in
official
paintings
in
english
official
heraldry
where
no
matter
how
great
the
number
of
crests
one
helmet
only
is
painted
it
naturally
follows
that
one
mantling
only
can
be
depicted
this
is
always
taken
from
the
livery
colours
of
the
chief
the
first
quartering
or
in
scottish
patents
at
the
present
day
in
which
a
helmet
is
painted
for
each
crest
the
mantlings
frequently
vary
being
in
each
case
in
accordance
with
the
livery
colours
of
the
quartering
to
which
the
crest
belongs
consequently
this
must
be
accepted
as
the
rule
in
cases
where
more
than
one
helmet
is
shown
in
considering
the
fashionings
of
mantlings
it
must
be
remembered
that
styles
and
fashions
much
overlap
and
there
has
always
been
the
tendency
in
armory
to
repeat
earlier
styles
whilst
one
willingly
concedes
the
immense
gain
in
beauty
by
the
present
reversion
in
heraldic
art
to
older
and
better
and
certainly
more
artistic
types
there
is
distinctly
another
side
to
the
question
which
is
strangely
overlooked
by
those
who
would
have
the
heraldic
art
slavishly
copied
in
all
minutiæ
of
detail
and
even
according
to
some
in
all
the
crudity
of
draughtmanship
from
examples
of
the
earliest
periods
hitherto
each
period
of
heraldic
art
has
had
its
own
peculiar
style
and
type
each
within
limits
readily
recognisable
whether
that
style
and
type
can
be
considered
when
judged
by
the
canons
of
art
to
be
good
or
bad
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
each
style
in
its
turn
has
approximated
to
and
has
been
in
keeping
with
the
concurrent
decorative
art
outside
and
beyond
heraldry
though
it
has
always
exhibited
a
tendency
to
rather
lag
behind
when
all
has
been
said
and
done
that
can
be
heraldry
in
spite
of
its
symbolism
and
its
many
other
meanings
remains
but
a
form
of
decorative
art
and
therefore
it
is
natural
that
it
should
be
influenced
by
other
artistic
ideas
and
other
manifestations
of
art
and
accepted
forms
of
design
current
at
the
period
to
which
it
belongs
for
from
the
artistic
point
of
view
the
part
played
in
art
by
heraldry
is
so
limited
in
extent
compared
with
the
part
occupied
by
other
forms
of
decoration
that
one
would
naturally
expect
heraldry
to
show
the
influence
of
outside
decorative
art
to
a
greater
extent
than
decorative
art
as
a
whole
would
be
likely
to
show
the
influence
of
heraldry
in
our
present
revulsion
of
mind
in
favour
of
older
heraldic
types
we
are
apt
to
speak
of
good
or
bad
heraldic
art
but
art
itself
can
not
so
be
divided
for
after
all
allowances
have
been
made
for
crude
workmanship
and
when
bad
or
imperfect
examples
have
been
eliminated
from
consideration
and
given
always
necessarily
the
essential
basis
of
the
relation
of
line
to
curve
and
such
technical
details
of
art
who
on
earth
is
to
judge
or
who
is
competent
to
say
whether
any
particular
style
of
art
is
good
or
bad
no
one
from
preference
executes
speculative
art
which
he
knows
whilst
executing
it
to
be
bad
most
manifestations
of
art
and
peculiarly
of
decorative
art
are
commercial
matters
executed
with
the
frank
idea
of
subsequent
sale
and
consequently
with
the
subconscious
idea
true
though
but
seldom
acknowledged
of
pleasing
that
public
which
will
have
to
buy
consequently
the
ultimate
appeal
is
to
the
taste
of
the
public
for
art
if
it
be
not
the
desire
to
give
pleasure
by
the
representation
of
beauty
is
nothing
beauty
of
course
must
not
necessarily
be
confounded
with
prettiness
it
may
be
beauty
of
character
the
result
is
therefore
that
the
decorative
art
of
any
period
is
an
indication
of
that
which
gives
pleasure
at
the
moment
and
an
absolute
reflex
of
the
artistic
wishes
desires
and
tastes
of
the
cultivated
classes
to
whom
executive
art
must
appeal
at
every
period
it
has
been
found
that
this
taste
is
constantly
changing
and
as
a
consequence
the
examples
of
decorative
art
of
any
period
are
a
reflex
only
of
the
artistic
ideas
current
at
the
time
the
work
was
done
at
all
periods
therefore
even
during
the
early
victorian
period
which
we
are
now
taught
and
believe
to
be
the
most
ghastly
period
through
which
english
art
has
passed
the
art
in
vogue
has
been
what
the
public
have
admired
and
have
been
ready
to
pay
for
and
most
emphatically
what
they
have
been
taught
and
brought
up
to
consider
good
art
in
early
victorian
days
there
was
no
lack
of
educated
people
and
because
they
liked
the
particular
form
of
decoration
associated
with
their
period
who
is
justified
in
saying
that
because
that
peculiar
style
of
decoration
is
not
acceptable
now
to
ourselves
their
art
was
bad
and
worse
than
our
own
if
throughout
the
ages
there
had
been
one
dominating
style
of
decoration
equally
accepted
at
all
periods
and
by
all
authorities
as
the
highest
type
of
decorative
art
then
we
should
have
some
standard
to
judge
by
such
is
not
the
case
and
we
have
no
such
standard
and
any
attempt
to
arbitrarily
create
and
control
ideas
between
given
parallel
lines
of
arbitrary
thought
when
the
ideas
are
constantly
changing
is
impossible
and
undesirable
who
dreams
of
questioning
the
art
of
benvenuto
cellini
or
of
describing
his
craftsmanship
as
other
than
one
of
the
most
vivid
examples
of
his
period
and
yet
what
had
it
in
keeping
with
the
art
of
the
louis
xvi
period
or
the
later
art
of
william
morris
and
his
followers
widely
divergent
as
are
these
types
they
are
nevertheless
all
accepted
as
the
highest
expressions
of
three
separate
types
of
decorative
art
any
one
attempting
to
compare
them
or
to
rank
these
schools
of
artistic
thought
in
order
of
superiority
would
simply
be
laying
themselves
open
to
ridicule
unspeakable
for
they
would
be
ranked
by
the
highest
authorities
of
different
periods
in
different
orders
and
it
is
as
impossible
to
create
a
permanent
standard
of
art
as
it
is
impossible
to
ensure
a
permanence
of
any
particular
public
taste
the
fact
that
taste
changes
and
as
a
consequence
that
artistic
styles
and
types
vary
is
simply
due
to
the
everlasting
desire
on
the
part
of
the
public
for
some
new
thing
and
their
equally
permanent
appreciation
of
novelty
of
idea
or
sensation
that
have
arisen
to
teach
and
that
they
have
taught
with
some
success
their
own
particular
brand
of
art
to
the
public
would
seem
rather
to
argue
against
the
foregoing
ideas
were
it
not
that
when
the
and
the
dominating
influence
are
gone
the
public
desiring
as
always
change
and
novelty
are
ready
to
fly
to
any
new
teacher
and
master
who
can
again
afford
them
artistic
pleasure
the
influence
of
william
morris
in
household
decoration
is
possibly
the
most
modern
example
of
the
influence
of
a
single
man
upon
the
art
of
his
period
but
as
was
his
and
as
he
was
it
has
needed
but
a
few
years
since
his
death
to
start
the
undoing
of
much
that
he
taught
after
the
movement
initiated
by
morris
and
carried
further
by
the
arts
and
crafts
society
which
made
for
simplicity
in
structural
design
as
well
as
in
the
decoration
of
furniture
we
have
now
fallen
back
upon
the
flowery
patterns
of
the
early
victorian
period
and
there
is
hardly
a
in
fashionable
london
where
the
chairs
and
settees
are
not
covered
with
early
victorian
chintzes
artistic
authorities
may
shout
themselves
hoarse
but
the
fashion
having
been
set
in
mayfair
will
be
inevitably
followed
in
suburbia
and
we
are
doubtless
again
at
the
beginning
of
the
cycle
of
that
curious
manifestation
of
domestic
decorative
art
which
was
current
in
the
early
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
it
is
therefore
evident
that
it
is
futile
to
describe
varying
types
of
art
of
varying
periods
as
good
or
bad
or
to
differentiate
between
them
unless
some
such
permanent
basis
of
comparison
or
standard
of
excellence
be
conceded
the
differing
types
must
be
accepted
as
no
more
than
the
expression
of
the
artistic
period
to
which
they
belong
that
being
so
one
can
not
help
thinking
that
the
abuse
which
has
been
heaped
of
late
by
unthinking
votaries
of
plantagenet
and
tudor
heraldry
upon
heraldic
art
in
the
seventeenth
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
has
very
greatly
overstepped
the
true
proportion
of
the
matter
much
that
has
been
said
is
true
but
what
has
been
said
too
often
lacks
proportion
there
is
consequently
much
to
be
said
in
favour
of
allowing
each
period
to
create
its
own
style
and
type
of
heraldic
design
in
conformity
with
the
ideas
concerning
decorative
art
which
are
current
outside
heraldic
thought
this
is
precisely
what
is
not
happening
at
the
present
time
even
with
all
our
boasted
revival
of
armory
and
armorial
art
the
tendency
at
the
present
time
is
to
slavishly
copy
examples
of
other
periods
there
is
another
point
which
is
usually
overlooked
by
the
most
blatant
followers
of
this
school
of
thought
what
are
the
ancient
models
which
remain
to
us
the
early
rolls
of
arms
of
which
we
hear
so
much
are
not
and
were
never
intended
to
be
examples
of
artistic
execution
they
are
merely
memoranda
of
it
is
absurd
to
suppose
that
an
actual
shield
was
painted
with
the
crudity
to
be
met
with
in
the
rolls
of
arms
it
is
equally
absurd
to
accept
as
unimpeachable
models
garter
plates
seals
or
architectural
examples
unless
the
purpose
and
medium
wax
enamel
or
stone
in
which
they
are
executed
is
borne
in
mind
and
the
knowledge
used
with
due
discrimination
eve
without
slavishly
copying
originally
appears
to
have
modelled
his
work
upon
the
admirable
designs
and
ideas
of
the
little
masters
of
german
art
in
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
he
has
since
progressed
therefrom
to
a
distinctive
and
very
excellent
style
of
his
own
graham
johnson
models
his
work
upon
plantagenet
and
tudor
examples
the
work
of
père
anselm
and
of
pugin
the
first
start
towards
the
present
ideas
of
heraldic
art
embodying
as
it
did
so
much
of
the
beauty
of
the
older
work
whilst
possessing
a
character
of
its
own
and
developing
ancient
ideals
by
increased
beauty
of
execution
has
placed
their
reputation
far
above
that
of
others
who
following
in
their
footsteps
have
not
possessed
their
abilities
but
with
regard
to
most
of
the
heraldic
design
of
the
present
day
as
a
whole
it
is
very
evident
that
we
are
simply
picking
and
choosing
from
the
work
of
bygone
craftsmen
and
copying
more
or
less
slavishly
examples
of
other
periods
this
makes
for
no
advance
in
design
either
in
its
character
or
execution
nor
will
it
result
in
any
peculiarity
of
style
which
it
will
be
possible
in
the
future
to
identify
with
the
present
period
our
heraldry
like
our
architecture
though
it
may
be
dated
in
the
twentieth
century
will
be
a
heterogeneous
collection
of
isolated
specimens
of
gothic
tudor
or
queen
anne
style
and
type
which
surely
is
as
anachronistic
as
we
consider
to
be
those
dutch
paintings
which
represent
christ
and
the
apostles
in
modern
clothes
roughly
the
periods
into
which
the
types
of
mantlings
can
be
divided
when
considered
from
the
standpoint
of
their
fashioning
are
somewhat
as
follows
there
is
the
earliest
period
of
all
when
the
mantling
depicted
approximated
closely
if
it
was
not
an
actual
representation
of
the
capelote
really
worn
in
battle
examples
of
this
will
be
found
in
the
de
and
the
zurich
as
the
mantling
worn
lengthened
and
evolved
itself
into
the
lambrequin
the
mantling
depicted
in
heraldic
art
was
similarly
increased
in
size
terminating
in
the
long
mantle
drawn
in
profile
but
tasselled
and
with
the
scalloped
edges
a
type
which
is
found
surviving
in
some
of
the
early
garter
plates
this
is
the
transition
stage
the
next
definite
period
is
when
we
find
the
mantling
depicted
on
both
sides
of
the
helmet
and
the
scalloped
edges
developed
in
accordance
with
the
romantic
ideas
of
the
period
into
the
slashes
and
cuts
of
the
bold
and
artistic
mantlings
of
plantagenet
armorial
art
slowly
decreasing
in
strength
but
at
the
same
time
increasing
in
elaboration
this
mantling
and
type
continued
until
it
had
reached
its
highest
pitch
of
exuberant
elaboration
in
stuart
and
early
georgian
times
side
by
side
with
this
came
the
revulsion
to
a
puritan
simplicity
of
taste
which
is
to
be
found
in
other
manifestations
of
art
at
the
same
time
and
which
made
itself
evident
in
heraldic
decoration
by
the
use
as
mantling
of
the
plain
uncut
cloth
suspended
behind
the
shield
originating
in
elizabethan
days
this
plain
cloth
was
much
made
use
of
but
towards
the
end
of
the
stuart
period
came
that
curious
evolution
of
british
heraldry
which
is
peculiar
to
these
countries
alone
that
is
the
entire
omission
of
both
helmet
and
mantling
how
it
originated
it
is
difficult
to
understand
unless
it
be
due
to
the
fact
that
a
large
number
in
fact
a
large
proportion
of
english
families
possessed
a
shield
only
and
neither
claimed
nor
used
a
crest
and
that
consequently
a
large
number
of
heraldic
representations
give
the
shield
only
it
is
rare
indeed
to
find
a
shield
surmounted
by
helmet
and
mantling
when
the
former
is
not
required
to
support
a
crest
at
the
same
time
we
find
among
the
official
records
of
the
period
that
the
documents
of
chief
importance
were
the
visitation
books
in
these
probably
from
motives
of
economy
or
to
save
needless
draughtsmanship
the
trouble
of
depicting
the
helmet
and
mantling
was
dispensed
with
and
the
crest
is
almost
universally
found
depicted
on
the
wreath
which
is
made
to
rest
upon
the
shield
the
helmet
being
omitted
that
being
an
accepted
official
way
of
representing
an
achievement
small
wonder
that
the
public
followed
and
we
find
as
a
consequence
that
a
large
proportion
of
the
bookplates
during
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
had
no
helmet
or
mantling
at
all
the
elaboration
of
the
edges
of
the
shield
together
with
the
addition
of
decorative
and
needless
accessories
bearing
no
relation
to
the
arms
fulfilling
all
purposes
of
decorative
design
it
should
also
be
remembered
that
from
towards
the
close
of
the
stuart
period
onward
england
was
taking
her
art
and
decoration
almost
entirely
from
continental
sources
chiefly
french
and
italian
in
both
the
countries
the
use
of
crests
was
very
limited
indeed
in
extent
and
the
elimination
of
the
helmet
and
mantling
and
the
elaboration
in
their
stead
of
the
edges
of
the
shield
we
probably
owe
to
the
effort
to
assimilate
french
and
italian
forms
of
decoration
to
english
arms
so
obsolete
had
become
the
use
of
helmet
and
mantling
that
it
is
difficult
to
come
across
examples
that
one
can
put
forward
as
mantlings
typical
of
the
period
helmets
and
mantlings
were
of
course
painted
upon
grants
and
upon
the
stall
plates
of
the
knights
of
the
various
orders
but
whilst
the
helmets
became
weak
of
a
pattern
impossible
to
wear
and
small
in
size
the
mantling
became
of
a
stereotyped
pattern
and
of
a
design
poor
and
wooden
according
to
our
present
ideas
illustration
fig
carriage
panel
of
georgiana
marchioness
of
cholmondeley
unofficial
heraldry
had
sunk
to
an
even
lower
style
of
art
and
the
regulation
heraldic
stationer
types
of
shield
mantling
and
helmet
are
in
their
ugliness
the
term
mantle
is
sometimes
employed
but
it
would
seem
hardly
quite
correctly
to
the
parliamentary
robe
of
estate
upon
which
the
arms
of
a
peer
of
the
realm
were
so
frequently
depicted
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
and
in
the
early
part
of
the
nineteenth
centuries
its
popularity
is
an
indication
of
the
predilection
for
something
which
is
denied
to
others
and
the
possession
of
which
is
a
matter
of
privilege
woodward
in
his
treatise
on
heraldry
treats
of
and
dismisses
the
matter
in
one
short
sentence
in
england
the
suggestion
that
the
arms
of
peers
should
be
mantled
with
their
parliament
robes
was
never
generally
adopted
in
this
statement
he
is
quite
incorrect
for
as
the
accepted
type
in
one
particular
opportunity
of
armorial
display
its
use
was
absolutely
universal
the
opportunity
in
question
was
the
emblazonment
of
arms
upon
carriage
panels
in
the
early
part
of
the
nineteenth
and
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
centuries
armorial
bearings
were
painted
of
some
size
upon
carriages
and
there
were
few
such
paintings
executed
for
the
carriages
chariots
and
state
coaches
of
peers
that
did
not
appear
upon
a
background
of
the
robe
of
estate
with
the
modern
craze
for
ostentatious
unostentation
the
result
there
can
be
little
doubt
in
this
respect
of
the
wholesale
appropriation
of
arms
by
those
without
a
right
to
bear
these
ornaments
the
decoration
of
a
peer
carriage
nowadays
seldom
shows
more
than
a
simple
coronet
or
a
coroneted
crest
initial
or
monogram
but
the
state
chariots
of
those
who
still
possess
them
almost
all
without
exception
show
the
arms
emblazoned
upon
the
robe
of
estate
the
royal
and
many
other
state
chariots
made
or
refurbished
for
the
recent
coronation
ceremonies
show
that
when
an
opportunity
of
the
fullest
display
properly
arises
the
robe
of
estate
is
not
yet
a
thing
of
the
past
fig
is
from
a
photograph
of
a
carriage
panel
and
shows
the
arms
of
a
former
marchioness
of
cholmondeley
displayed
in
this
manner
incidentally
it
also
shows
a
practice
frequently
resorted
to
but
quite
unauthorised
of
taking
one
supporter
from
the
shield
and
the
other
when
the
wife
was
an
heiress
from
the
arms
of
her
family
the
arms
are
those
of
georgiana
charlotte

of

and

daughter
and
coheir
of

have
been
painted

mantled
usually
with
crimson
velvet
fringed
with

lined

the

armoyé
was
one
of
the
marks
of

used
by
the

and
by

resident

it
was
also
employed

the
pavilion
is
a
feature
of
heraldic
art
which
is
quite
unknown
to
british
heraldry
and
one
can
call
to
mind
no
single
instance
of
its
use
in
this
country
but
as
its
use
is
very
prominent
in
germany
and
other
countries
it
can
not
be
overlooked
it
is
confined
to
the
arms
of
sovereigns
and
the
pavilion
is
the
erection
within
which
the
heraldic
achievement
is
displayed
the
pavilion
seems
to
have
originated
in
france
where
it
can
be
traced
back
upon
the
great
seals
of
the
kings
to
its
earliest
form
and
appearance
upon
the
seal
of
louis
xi
in
the
case
of
the
kings
of
france
it
was
of
azure
or
the
pavilion
used
with
the
arms
of
the
german
emperor
is
of
gold
semé
alternately
of
imperial
crowns
and
eagles
displayed
sable
and
is
lined

the

is

band
and
it
is
surmounted
by
the
imperial
crown
and
a
banner
of
the
german
colours
gules
argent
and
sable
the
pavilion
used
by
the
german
emperor
as
king
of
prussia
is
of
crimson
semé
of
black
eagles
and
gold
crowns
and
the

which
carries
the

is

the
duke
of
the
duke
of
the

and
the
duke
of
anhalt
are
all
of
crimson
in
german
heraldry
a
rather
more
noticeable
distinction
is
drawn
than
with
ourselves
between
the
lambrequin
and
the
mantle
this
more
closely
approximates
to
the
robe
of
estate
though
the
has
not
in
germany
the
rigid
significance
of
peerage
degree
that
the
robe
of
estate
has
in
this
country
the
german
with
few
exceptions
is
always
of
purple
lined
with
ermine
and
whilst
the
mantel
always
falls
directly
from
the
coronet
or
cap
the
pavilion
is
arranged
in
a
form
which
bears
the
crown
upon
its
summit
the
pavilion
is
supposed
to
be
the
invention
of
the
frenchman
philip
moreau
and
found
its
way
from
france
to
germany
where
both
in
the
greater
and
lesser
courts
it
was
enthusiastically
adopted
great
britain
spain
portugal
and

are
the
only
royal
arms
in
which

does

figure
chapter
xxv
the
torse
or
wreath
the
actual
helmet
from
the
very
heraldic
representations
which
have
come
down
to
us
would
sometimes
appear
not
to
have
had
any
mantling
the
crest
being
affixed
direct
to
the
then
flat
top
of
the
helmet
in
use
but
occasional
crests
appear
very
early
in
the
existence
of
ordered
armory
and
at
much
about
the
same
time
we
find
the
textile
covering
of
the
helmet
coming
into
heraldic
use
in
the
earliest
times
we
find
that
frequently
the
crest
itself
was
continued
into
the
mantling
but
where
this
was
not
possible
the
attaching
of
the
crest
to
the
helmet
when
the
mantling
intervened
left
an
unsightly
joining
the
unsightliness
very
soon
called
forth
a
remedy
at
first
this
remedy
took
the
form
of
a
coronet
or
a
plain
fillet
or
ribbon
round
the
point
of
juncture
sometimes
with
and
sometimes
without
the
ends
being
visible
if
the
ends
were
shown
they
were
represented
as
floating
behind
sometimes
with
and
sometimes
without
a
representation
of
the
bow
or
knot
in
which
they
were
tied
the
plain
fillet
still
continued
to
be
used
long
after
the
torse
had
come
into
recognised
use
the
consideration
of
crest
coronets
has
been
already
included
but
with
regard
to
the
wreath
an
analysis
of
the
plantagenet
garter
plates
will
afford
some
definite
basis
from
which
to
start
deduction
of
the
achievements
reproduced
in
john
hope
book
five
have
no
crest
consequently
we
have
examples
to
analyse
of
these
there
are
ten
in
which
the
crest
is
not
attached
to
the
lambrequin
and
helmet
by
anything
perceptible
eight
are
attached
with
fillets
of
varying
widths
crests
are
upon
chapeaux
and
issue
from
coronets
but
at
no
period
governed
by
the
series
is
it
possible
that
either
fillet
torse
chapeau
or
coronet
was
in
use
to
the
exclusion
of
another
form
this
remark
applies
more
particularly
to
the
fillet
and
torse
the
latter
of
which
undoubtedly
at
a
later
date
superseded
the
former
for
both
at
the
beginning
and
at
the
end
of
the
series
referred
to
we
find
the
fillet
and
the
wreath
or
torse
and
at
both
periods
we
find
crests
without
either
coronet
torse
chapeau
or
fillet
the
fillet
must
soon
afterwards
in
the
fifteenth
century
have
completely
fallen
into
desuetude
the
torse
was
so
small
and
unimportant
a
matter
that
upon
seals
it
would
probably
equally
escape
the
attention
of
the
engraver
and
the
observer
and
probably
there
would
be
little
to
be
gained
by
a
systematic
hunt
through
early
seals
to
discover
the
date
of
its
introduction
but
it
will
be
noticed
that
no
wreaths
appear
in
some
of
the
early
rolls
general
leigh
says
in
the
time
of
henry
the
fifth
and
long
after
no
man
had
his
badge
set
on
a
wreath
under
the
degree
of
a
knight
but
that
order
is
worn
away
it
probably
belongs
to
the
end
of
the
fourteenth
century
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
its
twisted
shape
was
an
evolution
from
the
plain
fillet
suggested
by
the
turban
of
the
east
we
read
in
the
old
romances
in
mallory
morte
and
elsewhere
of
valiant
knights
who
in
battle
or
tournament
wore
the
favour
of
some
lady
or
even
the
lady
sleeve
upon
their
helmets
it
always
used
to
be
a
puzzle
to
me
how
the
sleeve
could
have
been
worn
upon
the
helmet
and
i
wonder
how
many
of
the
novelists
who
so
glibly
make
their
knightly
heroes
of
olden
time
wear
the
favours
of
their
know
how
it
was
done
the
favour
did
not
take
the
place
of
the
crest
a
knight
did
not
lightly
discard
an
honoured
inherited
and
known
crest
for
the
sake
of
wearing
a
favour
only
too
frequently
the
mere
result
of
a
temporary
flirtation
nor
to
wear
her
colours
could
he
at
short
notice
discard
or
renew
his
lambrequin
surcoat
or
the
housings
and
trappings
of
his
horse
he
simply
took
the
favour
the
colours
a
ribbon
or
a
handkerchief
of
the
lady
as
the
case
might
be
and
twisted
it
in
and
out
or
over
and
over
the
fillet
which
surrounded
the
of
crest
and
helmet
to
put
her
favour
on
his
helmet
was
the
work
of
a
moment
the
wearing
of
a
sleeve
which
must
have
been
an
honour
greatly
prized
is
of
course
the
origin
of
the
maunch
the
solitary
charge
in
the
arms
of
conyers
hastings
and
wharton
doubtless
the
sleeve
twined
with
the
fillet
would
be
made
to
encircle
the
base
of
the
crest
and
it
is
not
unlikely
that
the
wide
hanging
mouth
of
the
sleeve
might
have
been
used
for
the
lambrequin
the
dresses
of
ladies
at
that
period
were
decorated
with
the
arms
of
their
families
so
in
each
case
would
be
of
the
colours
of
the
lady
so
that
the
sleeve
and
its
colours
would
be
quickly
identified
as
it
was
no
doubt
usually
intended
they
should
be
the
accidental
result
of
twining
a
favour
in
the
fillet
in
conjunction
with
the
pattern
obviously
suggested
by
the
turban
of
the
east
produced
the
conventional
torse
or
wreath
as
the
conventional
slashings
of
the
lambrequin
hinted
at
past
hard
fighting
in
battle
so
did
the
conventional
torse
hint
at
past
service
to
and
favour
of
ladies
love
and
war
being
the
occupations
of
the
perfect
knight
of
romance
how
far
short
of
the
ideal
knight
of
romance
the
knight
of
fact
fell
perhaps
the
frequent
bordures
and
batons
of
heraldry
are
the
best
indication
at
first
as
is
evident
from
the
garter
plates
the
colours
of
the
torse
seem
to
have
had
little
or
no
compulsory
relation
to
the
livery
colours
of
the
arms
the
instances
to
be
gleaned
from
the
plantagenet

which
have
been
reproduced
are

be

that

i
can
suggest
no
explanation
of
these
differences
unless
it
be
which
is
not
unlikely
that
they
perpetuate
favours
worn
or
perhaps
a
more
likely
supposition
is
that
the
wreath
or
torse
was
of
the
family
colours
as
these
were
actually
worn
by
the
servants
or
retainers
of
each
person
if
this
be
not
the
case
why
are
the
colours
of
the
wreath
termed
the
livery
colours
at
the
present
time
in
an
english
or
irish
grant
of
arms
the
colours
are
not
specified
but
the
crest
is
stated
to
be
on
a
wreath
of
the
colours
in
scotland
however
the
crest
is
granted
in
the
following
words
and
upon
a
wreath
of
his
liveries
is
set
for
crest
consequently
i
have
very
little
doubt
the
true
state
of
the
case
is
that
originally
the
wreath
was
depicted
of
the
colours
of
the
livery
which
was
worn
then
new
families
came
into
prominence
and
eminence
and
had
no
liveries
to
inherit
they
were
granted
arms
and
chose
the
tinctures
of
their
arms
as
their
colours
and
used
these
colours
for
their
personal
liveries
the
natural
consequence
would
be
in
such
a
case
that
the
torse
being
in
unison
with
the
livery
was
also
in
unison
with
the
arms
the
consequence
is
that
it
has
become
a
fixed
unalterable
rule
in
british
heraldry
that
the
torse
shall
be
of
the
principal
metal
and
of
the
principal
colour
of
the
arms
i
know
of
no
recent
exception
to
this
rule
the
latest
as
far
as
i
am
aware
being
a
grant
in
the
early
years
of
the
eighteenth
century
this
it
is
stated
in
the
patent
was
the
regranting
of
a
coat
of
foreign
origin
doubtless
the
formality
of
a
grant
was
substituted
for
the
usual
registration
in
this
case
owing
to
a
lack
of
formal
proof
of
a
right
to
the
arms
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
peculiarities
of
the
foreign
arms
as
they
had
been
previously
borne
were
preserved
in
the
grant
the
peculiarity
in
this
case
consisted
of
a
torse
of
three
tinctures
the
late
lyon
clerk
once
pointed
out
to
me
in
lyon
register
an
instance
of
a
coat
there
matriculated
with
a
torse
of
three
colours
but
i
unfortunately
made
no
note
of
it
at
the
time
woodward
alludes
to
the
curious
chequy
wreath
on
the
seals
of
robert
stewart
duke
of
albany
in
this
appears
to
have
been
repeated
in
the
seals
of
his
son
murdoch
the
wreath
of
patrick
hepburn
appears
to
be
of
roses
in
the
gelre
armorial
and
a
careful
examination
of
the
plates
in
this
volume
will
show
many
curious
continental
instances
of
substitutes
for
the
conventional
torse
though
by
no
means
peculiar
to
british
heraldry
there
can
be
no
manner
of
doubt
that
the
wreath
in
the
united
kingdom
has
obtained
a
position
of
legalised
necessity
and
constant
usage
and
importance
which
exists
in
no
other
country
as
has
been
already
explained
the
torse
should
fit
closely
to
the
crest
its
object
and
purpose
being
merely
to
hide
the
joining
of
crest
and
helmet
unfortunately
in
british
heraldry
this
purpose
has
been
ignored
doubtless
resulting
first
from
the
common
practice
of
depicting
a
crest
upon
a
wreath
and
without
a
helmet
and
secondly
from
the
fact
that
many
english
crests
are
quite
unsuitable
to
place
on
a
helmet
in
fact
impossible
to
affix
by
the
aid
of
a
wreath
to
a
helmet
and
thirdly
from
our
ridiculous
rules
of
position
for
a
helmet
which
result
in
the
crest
being
depicted
in
conjunction
with
the
representation
of
the
helmet
in
a
position
many
such
crests
never
could
have
occupied
on
any
helmet
the
effect
has
been
to
cause
the
wreath
to
lose
its
real
form
which
encircled
the
and
to
become
considered
as
no
more
than
a
straight
support
for
and
relating
only
to
the
crest
when
therefore
the
crest
and
its
supporting
basis
is
transferred
from
indefinite
space
to
the
helmet
the
support
which
is
the
torse
is
still
represented
as
a
flat
for
the
crest
and
it
is
consequently
depicted
as
a
straight
and
rigid
bar
balanced
upon
the
apex
of
the
helmet
this
is
now
and
for
long
has
been
the
only
accepted
official
way
of
depicting
a
wreath
in
england
certainly
this
is
an
ungraceful
and
inartistic
rendering
and
a
rendering
far
removed
from
any
actual
helmet
wreath
that
can
ever
have
been
actually
borne
whilst
one
has
no
wish
to
defend
the
rigid
bar
which
has
nothing
to
recommend
it
it
is
at
the
same
time
worth
while
to
point
out
that
the
heraldic
day
of
actual
helmets
and
actual
usage
is
long
since
over
never
to
be
revived
and
that
our
heraldry
of
is
merely
decorative
and
pictorial
the
rigid
bar
is
none
other
than
a
conventionalised
form
of
the
actual
torse
and
is
perhaps
little
more
at
variance
with
the
reality
than
is
our
conventionalised
method
of
depicting
a
lambrequin
whilst
this
conventional
torse
remains
the
official
pattern
it
is
hopeless
to
attempt
to
banish
such
a
method
of
representation
but
lyon
king
of
arms
happily
will
have
none
of
it
in
his
official
register

on
his
patents

few
heraldic
artists
of
any
repute
now
care
to
so
design

represent
it

chapter
xxvi
supporters
in
this
country
a
somewhat
fictitious
importance
has
become
attached
to
supporters
owing
to
their
almost
exclusive
reservation
to
the
highest
rank
the
rules
which
hold
at
the
moment
will
be
recited
presently
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
originally
they
were
in
this
country
little
more
than
mere
decorative
and
artistic
appendages
being
devised
and
altered
from
time
to
time
by
different
artists
according
as
the
artistic
necessities
of
the
moment
demanded
the
subject
of
the
origin
of
supporters
has
been
very
ably
dealt
with
in
a
treatise
on
heraldry
by
woodward
and
burnett
and
with
all
due
acknowledgment
i
take
from
that
work
the
subjoined
extract
supporters
are
figures
of
living
creatures
placed
at
the
side
or
sides
of
an
armorial
shield
and
appearing
to
support
it
french
writers
make
a
distinction
giving
the
name
of
to
animals
real
or
imaginary
thus
employed
while
human
figures
or
angels
similarly
used
are
called
trees
and
other
inanimate
objects
which
are
sometimes
used
are
called
menêtrier
and
other
old
writers
trace
the
origin
of
supporters
to
the
usages
of
the
tournaments
where
the
shields
of
the
combatants
were
exposed
for
inspection
and
guarded
by
their
servants
or
pages
disguised
in
fanciful
attire

des
the
old
romances
give
us
evidence
that
this
custom
prevailed
but
i
think
only
after
the
use
of
supporters
had
already
arisen
from
another
source
there
is
really
little
doubt
now
that
anstis
was
quite
correct
when
in
his
he
attributed
the
origin
of
supporters
to
the
invention
of
the
engraver
who
filled
up
the
spaces
at
the
top
and
sides
of
the
triangular
shield
upon
a
circular
seal
with
foliage
or
with
fanciful
animals
any
good
collection
of
mediæval
seals
will
strengthen
this
conviction
for
instance
the
two
volumes
of
laing
afford
numerous
examples
in
which
the
shields
used
in
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
centuries
were
placed
between
two
creatures
resembling
lizards
or
dragons
see
the
seal
of
alexander
de
balliol

the
seal
of
john
duke
of
normandy
eldest
son
of
the
king
of

bears
his
arms

between
two
lions
rampant

from
the
shield
and
an
eagle

expanded
wings

griffins
in

i
the
seal
of
humbert
dauphin
de
viennois
in
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
fashion
the
shield
of
dauphiny
is
in
the
centre
of
a
quatrefoil
two
savages
mounted
on
griffins
support
its
flanks
on
the
upper
edge
an
armed
knight
sits
on
a
couchant
lion
and
the
space
in

is
filled
by
a
human
face
between
two
wingless
dragons
the
spaces
are
sometimes
filled
with
the
evangelistic
symbols
as
on
the
seal
of
yolante

flandres
countess
of
bar

seal
of
jeanne

a
lion
couchant
guardant
in
base
corporate
and
other
seals
afford
countless
examples
of
the
interstices
in
the
design
being
filled
with
the
figures
similar
to
those
from
which
in
later
days
the
supporters
of
a
family
have
been
deduced
but
i
am
myself
convinced
that
the
argument
can
be
carried
further
fanciful
ornamentation
or
meaningless
devices
may
have
first
been
made
use
of
by
seal
engravers
but
it
is
very
soon
found
that
the
badge
is
in
regular
use
for
this
purpose
and
we
find
both
animate
and
inanimate
badges
employed
then
where
this
is
possible
the
badge
if
animate
is
made
to
support
the
helmet
and
crest
and
later
on
the
shield
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
the
badge
was
in
fact
acting
as
a
supporter
long
before
the
science
of
armory
recognised
that
existence
of
supporters
before
passing
to
supporters
proper
it
may
be
well
to
briefly
allude
to
various
figures
which
are
to
be
found
in
a
position
analogous
to
that
of
supporters
the
single
human
figure
entire
or
in
the
form
of
a
appearing
above
the
shield
is
very
frequently
to
be
met
with
but
the
addition
of
such
figures
and
remains
purely
and
i
know
of
no
single
instance
in
british
armory
where
one
figure
animate
or
inanimate
has
ever
existed
alone
in
the
character
of
a
single
supporter
and
as
an
integral
part
of
the
heritable
armorial
achievement
of
course
i
except
those
figures
upon
which
the
arms
of
certain
families
are
properly
displayed
these
will
be
presently
alluded
to
but
though
they
are
certainly
exterior
ornaments
i
do
not
think
they
can
be
properly
classed
as
supporters
unless
to
this
term
is
given
some
elasticity
or
unless
the
term
has
some
qualifying
remarks
of
reservation
added
to
it
there
are
however
many
instances
of
armorial
ensigns
depicted
and
presumably
correctly
in
the
form
of
banners
supported
by
a
single
animal
but
it
will
always
be
found
that
the
single
animal
is
but
one
of
the
pair
of
duly
allocated
supporters
many
instances
of
arms
depicted
in
this
manner
will
be
found
in
prince
arthur
book
the
same
method
of
display
was
adopted
in
some
number
of
cases
and
with
some
measure
of
success
in
peerage
single
figures
are
very
frequently
to
be
met
with
in
german
and
continental
heraldry
but
on
these
occasions
as
with
ourselves
the
position
they
occupy
is
merely
that
of
an
artistic
accessory
and
bears
no
inseparable
relation
to
the
heraldic
achievement
the
single
exception
to
the
foregoing
statement
of
which
i
am
aware
is
to
be
found
in
the
arms
of
the
swiss
cantons
these
thirteen
coats
are
sometimes
quartered
upon
one
shield
but
when
displayed
separately
each
is
accompanied
by
a
single
supporter
zurich

the
supporter
on

place
their
supporters
in
full
aspect
behind
the
shield
on
the
corbels
of
gothic
architecture
shields
of
arms
are
frequently
supported
by
which
however
can
not
generally
be
regarded
as
heraldic
appendages
being
merely
supposed
to
indicate
that
the
owners
have
contributed
to
the
erection
of
the
fabric
examples
of
this
practice
will
be
found
on
various
ecclesiastical
edifices
in
scotland
and
among
others
at
melrose
abbey
giles
edinburgh
and
the
church
of
seton
in
east
lothian
an
interesting
instance
of
an
angel
supporting
a
shield
occurs
on
the
beautiful
seal
of
mary
of
gueldres
queen
of
james
ii
and
the
privy
seal
of
david
a
hundred
years
earlier
exhibits
a
pretty
design
of
an
escutcheon
charged
with
the
ensigns
of
scotland
and
borne
by
two
arms
issuing
from
clouds
above
indicative
of
divine
support
of
instances
of
single
objects
from
which
shields
are
found
depending
or
supported
the
treatise
on
heraldry
states
allusion
has
been
made
to
the
usage
by
which
on
shields
ladies
of
high
rank
are
represented
as
supporting
with
either
hand
shields
of
arms
from
this
probably
arose
the
use
of
a
single
supporter

be
considered
akin
to

there
are
however
certain
exceptions
to
the
british
rule
that
there
can
be
no
single
supporters
if
the
objects
upon
which
shields
of
arms
are
displayed
are
accepted
as
supporters
it
was
always
customary
to
display
the
arms
of
the
lord
high
admiral
on
the
sail
of
the
ship
in
the
person
of
king
william
before
he
succeeded
to
the
throne
the
office
of
lord
high
admiral
was
vested
for
a
short
time
but
it
had
really
fallen
into
desuetude
at
an
earlier
date
and
has
not
been
revived
again
so
that
to
all
intents
and
purposes
it
is
now
extinct
and
this
recognised
method
of
depicting
arms
is
consequently
also
extinct
but
there
is
one
other
case
which
forms
a
unique
instance
which
can
be
classified
with
no
others
the
arms
of
campbell
of
craignish
are
always
represented
in
a
curious
manner
the
gyronny
coat
of
campbell
appearing
on
a
shield
displayed
in
front
of
a
lymphad
plate
what
the
origin
of
this
practice
is
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
probably
it
merely
originated
in
the
imaginative
ideas
of
an
artist
when
making
a
seal
for
that
family
artistic
reasons
suggesting
the
display
of
the
gyronny
arms
of
campbell
in
front
of
the
lymphad
of
lorne
the
family
however
seem
to
have
universally
adopted
this
method
of
using
their
arms
and
in
the
year
when
campbell
of
inverneil
matriculated
in
lyon
register
the
arms
were
matriculated
in
that
form
i
know
of
no
other
instance
of
any
such
coat
of
arms
and
this
branch
of
the
ducal
house
of
campbell
possesses
armorial
bearings
which
from
the
official
standpoint
are
absolutely
unique
from
one
end
of
europe
to
the
other
in
germany
the
use
of
arms
depicted
in
front
of
the
eagle
displayed
either
or
is
very
far
from
being
unusual
whatever
may
have
been
its
meaning
originally
in
that
country
there
is
no
doubt
that
now
and
for
some
centuries
past
it
has
been
accepted
as
meaning
or
as
indicative
of
princely
rank
or
other
honours
of
the
holy
roman
empire
but
i
do
not
think
it
can
always
have
had
that
meaning
about
the
same
date
the
earl
of
menteith
placed
his
shield
on
the
breast
of
an
eagle
as
did
alexander
earl
of
ross
in
and
in
we
find
the
same
ornamentation
in
the
seal
of
euphemia
countess
of
ross
the
shield
of
ross
is
borne
in
her
case
on
the
breast
of
an
eagle
while
the
arms
of
leslie
and
comyn
appear
on
its
displayed
wings
on
several
other
scottish
seals
of
the
same
era
the
shield
is
placed
on
the
breast
of
a

and

david

of
crawford
english
heraldry
supplies
several
similar
examples
of
which
we
may
mention
the
armorial
insignia
of
richard
earl
of
cornwall
brother
of
henry
and
of
the
ancient
family
of
latham
in
the
fourteenth
century
a
curious
instance
of
a
shield
placed
on
the
breast
of
a
is
noticed
by
hone
in
his
table
book
viz
the
arms
of
the
lord
of
the
manor
of
in
the
county
of
oxford
it
appears
therefrom
that
when
charles
held
his
parliament
at
oxford
the
offer
of
knighthood
was
gratefully
declined
by
the
then
lord
of
who
merely
requested
and
obtained
the
royal
permission
to
place
the
arms
of
his
family
upon
the
breast
of
a
hawk
which
has
ever
since
been
employed
in
the
capacity
of
single
supporter
what
authority
exists
for
this
statement
it
is
impossible
to
ascertain
and
one
must
doubt
its
accuracy
because
in
england
at
any
rate
no
arms
allocated
to
any
particular
have
ever
received
official
recognition
illustration
fig
arms
of
vöhlin
of
augsberg
in
later
years
as
indicative
of
rank
in
the
holy
roman
empire
the
eagle
has
been
rightly
borne
by
the
first
duke
of
marlborough
and
by
henrietta
his
daughter
duchess
of
marlborough
but
the
use
of
the
eagle
by
the
later
dukes
of
marlborough
would
appear
to
be
entirely
without
authority
inasmuch
as
the
princedom
created
in
the
person
of
the
first
duke
became
extinct
on
his
death
his
daughters
though
entitled
of
right
to
the
courtesy
rank
of
princess
and
its
accompanying
privilege
of
the
right
to
use
the
eagle
displayed
behind
their
arms
could
not
transmit
it
to
their
descendants
upon
whom
the
title
of
duke
of
marlborough
was
specially
entailed
by
english
act
of
parliament
the
earl
of
denbigh
and
several
members
of
the
fielding
family
have
often
made
use
of
it
with
their
arms
in
token
of
their
supposed
descent
from
the
counts
of
hapsburg
which
if
correct
would
apparently
confer
the
right
upon
them
this
descent
however
has
been
much
questioned
and
in
late
years
the
claim
thereto
would
seem
to
have
been
practically
dropped
the
late
earl
cowper
the
last
remaining
prince
of
the
holy
roman
empire
in
the
british
peerage
was
entitled
to
use
the
double
eagle
behind
his
shield

the

and

of
george

clavering

third
earl
cowper
created
a
prince
of
the
holy
roman
empire
by
the
emperor
joseph
the
patent
being
dated
at
vienna
january
and
this
being
followed
by
a
royal
licence
from
king
george
iii
to
accept
and
bear
the
title
in
this
country
there
are
some
others
who
have
the
right
by
reason
of
honours
of
lesser
rank
of
the
holy
roman
empire
and
amongst
these
may
be
mentioned
lord
methuen
who
bears
the
eagle
by
royal
warrant
dated
april
sir
thomas
arundel
who
served
in
the
imperial
army
of
hungary
having
in
an
engagement
with
the
turks
near
strignum
taken
their
standard
with
his
own
hands
was
by
rodolph
ii
created
count
of
the
empire
to
hold
for
him
and
the
heirs
of
his
body
for
ever
dated
at
prague
december
this
patent
of
course
means
that
every
one
of
his
descendants
in
the
male
line
has
the
rank
of
a
count
of
the
empire
and
that
every
daughter
of
any
such
male
descendant
is
a
countess
but
this
does
not
confer
the
rank
of
count
or
countess
upon
descendants
of
the
daughters
it
was
this
particular
patent
of
creation
that
called
forth
the
remark
from
queen
elizabeth
that
she
would
not
have
her
sheep
branded
by
any
foreign
shepherd
and
we
believe
that
this
patent
was
the
origin
of
the
rule
translated
in
later
times
george
iv
into
a
definite
royal
warrant
requiring
that
no
english
subject
shall
without
the
express
royal
licence
of
the
sovereign
conveyed
in
writing
accept
or
wear
any
foreign
title
or
decoration
no
royal
licence
was
subsequently
obtained
by
the
arundel
family
who
therefore
according
to
british
law
are
denied
the
use
of
the
privileged
imperial
eagle
outside
those
cases
in
which
the
double
eagle
is
used
in
this
country
to
denote
rank
of
the
holy
roman
empire
the
usage
of
the
eagle
displayed
behind
the
arms
or
any
analogous
figure
is
in
british
heraldry
most
limited
one
solitary
authoritative
instance
of
the
use
of
the
displayed
eagle
is
found
in
the
coat
of
arms
of
the
city
of
perth
these
arms
are
recorded
in
lyon
register
having
been
matriculated
for
that
royal
burgh
about
the
year
the
official
blazon
of
the
arms
is
as
follows
gules
ane
holy

and

on
the
breast
of
ane
eagle
with
two
necks
displayed
or
the
motto
in
ane
escroll
rege
lege
et
grege
another
instance
of
usage
though
purely
devoid
of
authority
occurs
in
the
case
of
a
coat
of
arms
set
up
on
one
of
the
panels
in
the
hall
of
inn
in
this
case
the
achievement
is
displayed
on
the
breast
of
a
eagle
what
reason
led
to
its
usage
in
this
manner
i
am
quite
unaware
and
i
have
not
the
slightest
reason
for
supposing
it
to
be
authentic
the
family
of
also
place
their
arms
upon
a
eagle
displayed
gules
as
was
formerly
to
be
seen
in
debrett
peerage
but
though
arms
are
matriculated
to
them
in
lyon
register
this
particular
adornment
forms
no
part
thereof
and
it
has
now
disappeared
from
the
printed
peerage
books
the
family
of
britton
have
however
recently
recorded
as
a
badge
a
eagle
displayed
ermine
holding
in
its
claws
an
escutcheon
of
their
arms
plate
occasionally
batons
or
wands
or
other
insignia
of
office
are
to
be
found
in
conjunction
with
armorial
bearings
but
these
will
be
more
fully
dealt
with
under
the
heading
of
insignia
of
office
before
dealing
with
the
usual
supporters
one
perhaps
may
briefly
allude
to
inanimate
supporters
probably
the
most
curious
instance
of
all
will
be
found
in
the
achievement
of
the
earls
of
errol
as
it
appears
in
the
of
sir
david
lindsay
in
this
two
take
the
place
of
the
supporters
the
curious
tradition
which
has
been
attached
to
the
hay
arms
is
quoted
as
follows
by
sir
james
balfour
paul
lyon
king
of
arms
in
his
heraldry
in
relation
to
scottish
history
and
art
who
writes
take
the
case
of
the
coat
of
the
hays
and
hear
the
description
of
its
origin
as
given
by
nisbet
the
reign
of
kenneth
about
the
year
when
the
danes
invaded
scotland
and
prevailing
in
the
battle
of
luncarty
a
country
scotsman
with
his
two
sons
of
great
strength
and
courage
having
rural
weapons
as
the
yokes
of
their
plough
and
such
plough
furniture
stopped
the
scots
in
their
flight
in
a
certain
defile
and
upbraiding
them
with
cowardice
obliged
them
to
rally
who
with
them
renewed
the
battle
and
gave
a
total
overthrow
to
the
victorious
danes
and
it
is
said
by
some
after
the
victory
was
obtained
the
old
man
lying
on
the
ground
wounded
and
fatigued
cried
hay
hay
which
word
became
a
surname
to
his
posterity
he
and
his
sons
being
nobilitate
the
king
gave
him
the
aforesaid
arms
argent
three
escutcheons
gules
to
intimate
that
the
father
and
the
two
sons
had
been
luckily
the
three
shields
of
scotland
and
gave
them
as
much
land
in
the
carse
of
gowrie
as
a
falcon
did
fly
over
without
lighting
which
having
flown
a
great
way
she
lighted
on
a
stone
there
called
the
falcon
stone
to
this
day
the
circumstances
of
which
story
is
not
only
perpetuated
by
the
three
escutcheons
but
by
the
exterior
ornaments
of
the
achievement
of
the
family
of
errol
having
for
crest
on
a
wreath
a
falcon
proper
for
supporters
two
men
in
country
habits
holding
the
of
a
plough
over
their
shoulders
and
for
motto
serva
jugum
unfortunately
for
the
truth
of
this
picturesque
tale
there
are
several
reasons
which
render
it
utterly
incredible
not
the
least
being
that
at
the
period
of
the
supposed
battle
armorial
bearings
were
quite
unknown
and
could
not
have
formed
the
subject
of
a
royal
gift
hill
burton
indeed
strongly
doubts
the
occurrence
of
the
battle
itself
and
says
that
hector
boece
who
relates
the
occurrence
must
be
under
strong
suspicion
of
having
entirely
invented
it
as
for
the
origin
of
the
name
itself
it
is
as
cosmo
innes
points
out
in
his
work
on
surnames
derived
from
a
place
in
normandy
and
neither
it
nor
any
other
surname
occurred
in
scotland
till
long
after
the
battle
of
luncarty
i
have
mentioned
this
story
in
some
detail
as
it
is
a
very
typical
specimen
of
its
class
but
there
are
others
like
unto
it
often
traceable
to
the
same
incorrigible
old
liar
hector
boece
it
is
not
unlikely
that
the
was
a
badge
of
the
hays
earls
of
errol
and
a
reference
to
the
variations
of
the
original
arms
crest
and
supporters
of
hay
will
show
how
the
changes
have
been
rung
on
the
shields
falcon
and
countrymen
of
the
legend
another
instance
is
to
be
found
in
the
arms
of
the
mowbray
family
as
they
were
at
one
time
depicted
with
an
ostrich
feather
on
either
side
of
the
shield
fig
and
at
first
one
might
be
inclined
to
class
these
amongst
the
inanimate
supporters
the
garter
plate
however
of
john
beaufort
duke
of
somerset
probably
supplies
the
key
to
the
whole
matter
for
this
shows
not
only
the
ostrich
feathers
but
also
supporters
of
the
ordinary
character
in
their
usual
position
from
the
instance
it
is
evident
the
ostrich
feathers
can
be
only
representations
of
the
badge
their
character
doubtless
being
peculiarly
adaptable
to
the
curious
position
they
occupy
they
are
of
course
the
same
in
the
case
of
the
mowbray
arms
and
doubtless
the
of
the
earl
of
errol
is
similarly
no
more
than
a
badge
a
most
curious
instance
of
supporters
is
to
be
found
in
the
case
of
the
arms
of
viscount
montgomery
this
occurs
in
a
record
of
them
in
office
where
the
arms
appear
without
the
usual
kind
of
supporters
but
represented
with
an
arm
in
armour
on
either
side
issuing
from
clouds
in
base
the
hands
supporting
the
shield
when
supporters
are
inanimate
objects
the
escutcheon
is
said
to
be
cottised
a
term
derived
from
the
french
word
a
side
in
contradistinction
to
supported
an
old
scottish
term
for
supporters
was
bearers
amongst
other
cases
where
the
shield
is
cottised
by
inanimate
objects
may
be
mentioned
the
following
the
breton
family
of
bastard
depict
their
shield
cottised
by
two
swords
with
the
points
in
base
the
marquises
alberti
similarly
use
two
lighted
flambeaux
and
the
dalzells
of
binns
the
extraordinary
device
of
a
pair
of
whether
this
last
has
been
officially
sanctioned
i
am
unaware
the
pillars
of
hercules
used
by
charles
are
perhaps
the
best
known
of
this
group
of
supporters
in
many
cases
notably
foreign
the
supporters
appear
to
have
gradually
receded
to
the
back
of
the
shield
as
in
the
case
of
the
comte
chancellor
of
brabant
where
two
maces
or
are
represented
saltirewise
the
shield
generally
however
this
variation
is
found
in
conjunction
with
purely
official
or
corporate
achievements
a
curious
example
of
inanimate
supporters
occurs
on
the
english
seal
of
william
lord
botreaux
where
on
each
side
of
a
couché
shield
exhibiting
a
griffin
segreant
and
surmounted
by
a
helmet
and
crest
a
buttress
is
quaintly
introduced
in
evident
allusion
to
the
owner
name
a
somewhat
similar
arrangement
appears
on
the
scottish
seal
of
william
ruthven
where
a
tree
growing
from
a
mount
is
placed
on
each
side
of
the
escutcheon
another
instance
is
to
be
found
in
the
seal
of
john
de
segrave
where
a
garb
is
placed
on
either
side
of
the
shield
perhaps
mention
should
here
be
made
of
the
arms
granted
in
of
the
national
bank
of
scotland
the
shield
of
which
is
surrounded
with
two
thistles
proper
disposed
in
orle
heraldic
supporters
as
such
or
badges
occupying
the
position
and
answering
the
purpose
of
supporters
and
not
merely
as
artistic
accessories
in
england
date
from
the
early
part
of
the
fourteenth
century
very
restricted
in
use
at
first
they
later
rapidly
became
popular
and
there
were
few
peers
who
did
not
display
them
upon
their
seals
for
some
reason
however
very
few
indeed
appear
on
the
early
garter
plates
it
is
a
striking
fact
that
by
far
the
larger
number
of
the
ancient
standards
display
as
the
chief
device
not
the
arms
but
one
of
the
supporters
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
in
this
fact
we
have
further
confirmation
of
my
belief
that
the
origin
of
supporters
is
found
in
the
badge
even
after
the
use
of
two
supporters
had
become
general
a
third
figure
is
often
found
placed
behind
the
shield
and
forms
a
connecting
link
with
the
old
practice
of
filling
the
void
spaces
on
seals
to
which
we
have
already
referred
on
the
seal
of
william
sterling
in
two
lions

the
shield
in

of

shield

supported
by
an
angel
and
by

that
of
pierre
avoir
in
is
held
by
a
above
the
shield
and
by
two
mermaids
on
many
ancient
seals
the
supporters
are
disposed
so
that
they
hold
the
crested
helm
above
a
couché
shield
the
of
rudolf
archduke
of
austria
in
and
afford
instances
in
which
a
second
set
of
supporters
is
used
to
hold
up
the
crested
helm
the
shield
of
austria
is
supported
by
two
lions
on
whose
volets
are
the
arms
of
hapsburg

having
a
panache
of

heraldry
historical
and
popular
pp
crested
supporters
have
sometimes
been
misunderstood
and
quoted
as
instances
of
double
supporters
for
instance
by
lower
curiosities
of
heraldry
who
gives
a
cut
from
the
achievement
of
the
french
as
the
most
singular
supporters
perhaps
in
the
whole
circle
of
heraldry
these
supporters
are
two
lions
couchant
or
each
helmed
and
crested
with
an
eagle
au
vol
leve
these
eagles
certainly
assist
in
holding
the
shield
but
the
lions
are
its
true
supporters
nor
is
this
arrangement
by
any
means
unique
the
swans
which
were
used
as
supporters
by
jean
duc
de
berri
in
are
each
mounted
upon

were
the
supporters
of
arnaud
in
scotland
which
is
the
home
of
curiosities
of
heraldry
gives
us
at
least
two
instances
of
the
use
of
supporters
which
must
be
absolutely
unique
that
is
the
surcharging
of
an
escutcheon
with
an
inescutcheon
to
the
latter
of
which
supporters
are
attached
the
first
instance
occurs
in
the
cases
of
baronets
of
nova
scotia
a
clause
appearing
in
all
the
earlier
patents
which
ordained
that
the
baronets
and
their
should
as
an
of
to
their
armorial
ensigns
bear
either
on
a
canton
or
inescutcheon

their
option

ensign
of

inescutcheon
of
the
royal
arms
of
scotland
supported
on

dexter
by

royal
unicorn
and
on
the
sinister
by
a
savage
or
wild
man

a

issuing
from
two
hands
conjoined
the
one
being
armed
the

with
the
motto
munit
hæc
et
altera
vincit
the
incongruity
of
these
exterior
ornaments
within
a
shield
of
arms
is
noticed
by
nisbet
who
informs
us
however
that
they
are
very
soon
removed
in
the
year
after
nova
scotia
was
sold
to
the
french
the
baronets
of
scotland
and
their
were
authorised
by
charles
i
to
wear
and
carry
about
their
necks
in
all
time
coming
an
silk
ribbon
whereon
shall
be
pendent
in
a
scutcheon
a
saltire
thereon
an
inescutcheon
of
the
arms
of
scotland
with
an
imperial
crown
above
the
scutcheon
and
encircled
with
this
motto
mentis
honestæ
gloria
according
to
the
same
authority
this
badge
was
never
much
used
about
their
necks
but
was
carried
by
way
of
canton
or
inescutcheon
on
their
armorial
bearings
without
the
motto
and
of
course
since
then
the
superimposed
supporters
have
been
dropped
the
same
peculiarity
of
supporters
being
surcharged
upon
a
shield
will
be
found
however
in
the
matriculation
to
of
altyre
these
arms
are
depicted
on
plate
iii
in
this
the
entire
achievement
arms

motto
and
supporters
of
gordon
of
gordon
is
placed
upon
an
inescutcheon
superimposed
over
the
arms
of
cumming
in
scotland
the
arms
and
the
arms
only
constitute
the
mark
of
a
given
family
and
whilst
due
difference
is
made
in
the
respective
shields
no
attempt
is
made
as
regards
crest
or
supporters
to
impose
any
distinction
between
the
figures
granted
to
different
families
even
where
no
blood
relationship
exists
the
result
is
that
whilst
the
same
crests
and
supporters
are
duplicated
over
and
over
again
they
at
any
rate
remain
in
scotland
simple
graceful
and
truly
heraldic
even
when
judged
by
the
most
rigid
mediæval
standard
they
are
of
course
necessarily
of
no
value
whatever
for
identification
in
england
the
simplicity
is
relinquished
for
the
sake
of
distinction
and
it
is
held
that
equivalent
differentiation
must
be
made
both
in
regard
to
the
crests
and
the
supporters
as
is
made
between
the
shields
of
different
families
the
result
as
to
modern
crests
is
truly
appalling
and
with
supporters
it
is
almost
equally
so
for
by
their
very
nature
it
is
impossible
to
design
adequate
differences
for
crests
and
supporters
as
can
readily
be
done
in
the
charges
upon
a
shield
without
creating
monstrosities
with
regret
one
has
to
admit
that
the
dangling
shields
the
diapered
bodies
and
the
fasces
and
other
footstools
so
frequently
provided
for
modern
supporters
in
england
would
seem
to
be
pedantic
unnecessary
and
inartistic
strivings
after
a
useless
ideal
in
england
the
right
to
bear
supporters
is
confined
to
those
to
whom
they
have
been
granted
or
recorded
but
such
grant
or
record
is
very
rigidly
confined
to
peers
to
knights
of
the
garter
thistle
and
patrick
and
to
knights
grand
cross
or
knights
grand
commanders
as
the
case
may
be
of
other
orders
before
the
order
of
the
bath
was
divided
into
classes
knights
of
the
bath
had
supporters
as
by
an
unwritten
but
nowadays
invariably
accepted
law
the
orders
of
the
garter
thistle
and
patrick
are
confined
to
members
of
the
peerage
those
entitled
to
claim
upon
their
petitioning
a
grant
of
supporters
in
england
are
in
practice
limited
to
peers
and
knights
grand
cross
or
knights
grand
commanders
in
the
cases
of
peers
the
grant
is
always
attached
to
a
particular
peerage
the
remainder
in
the
limitations
of
the
grant
being
to
those
of
his
descendants
upon
whom
the
peerage
may
devolve
or
some
other
words
to
this
effect
in
the
cases
of
life
peers
and
knights
grand
cross
the
grant
has
no
hereditary
limitation
and
the
right
to
the
supporters
is
personal
to
the
grantee
there
is
nothing
to
distinguish
the
supporters
of
a
peer
from
those
of
a
knight
grand
cross
baronets
of
england
ireland
great
britain
and
the
united
kingdom
as
such
are
not
entitled
to
claim
grants
of
supporters
but
there
are
some
number
of
cases
in
which
by
special
favour
of
the
sovereign
specific
royal
warrants
have
been
as
marks
of
favour
or
as
augmentations
of
honour
conveying
the
pleasure
of
the
sovereign
to
the
kings
of
arms
and
directing
the
latter
to
grant
supporters
to
descend
with
the
baronetcy
of
the
cases
of
this
nature
the
following
may
be
quoted
guise
royal
warrant
dated
july
prevost
royal
warrant
october
guinness
now
lord
ardilaun
royal
warrant
dated
april
halford
royal
warrant
may
otway
royal
warrant
june
and
laking
these
of
course
are
exceptional
marks
of
favour
from
the
sovereign
and
this
favour
in
at
least
two
instances
has
been
extended
to
untitled
families
in
george
an
especial
intimate
of
the
then
prince
regent
by
royal
warrant
dated
september
was
granted
the
following
supporters
on
either
side
a
leopard
proper
armed
and
langued
gules
collared
and
chained
or
a
more
recent
instance
and
with
the
exception
of
an
irish
case
presently
to
be
referred
to
the
only
other
one
within
the
knowledge
of
the
writer
is
the
case
of
the
speke
arms
it
is
recited
in
the
royal
warrant
dated
july
that
captain
john
hanning
speke
was
by
a
deplorable
accident
suddenly
deprived
of
his
life
before
he
had
received
any
mark
of
our
royal
favour
in
connection
with
the
discovery
of
the
sources
of
the
nile
the
warrant
goes
on
to
recite
the
grant
to
his
father
william
speke
of
jordans
somerset
of
the
following
augmentations
to
his
original
arms
argent
two
bars
azure
namely
on
a
chief
a
representation
of
flowing
water
superinscribed
with
the
word
nile
and
for
a
crest
of
honourable
augmentation
a
crocodile
also
the
supporters
following
that
is
to
say
on
the
dexter
side
a
crocodile
and
on
the
sinister
side
a
hippopotamus
some
number
of
english
baronets
have
gone
to
the
trouble
and
expense
of
obtaining
grants
of
supporters
in
lyon
office
for
example
sir
christopher
baynes
by
grant
dated
june
obtained
two
savages
wreathed
about
the
temples
and
loins
each
holding
a
club
over
the
exterior
shoulder
it
is
very
doubtful
to
what
extent
such
grants
in
scotland
to
domiciled
englishmen
can
be
upheld
many
other
baronets
have
at
one
time
or
another
assumed
supporters
without
any
official
warrant
or
authority
in
consequence
of
certain
action
taken
by
an
earlier
committee
of
the
baronetage
but
cases
of
this
kind
are
slowly
dropping
out
of
the
peerage
books
and
this
combined
with
the
less
ostentatious
taste
of
the
present
day
in
the
depicting
of
armorial
bearings
upon
carriages
and
elsewhere
is
slowly
but
steadily
reducing
the
use
of
supporters
to
those
who
possess
official
authority
for
their
display
another
fruitful
origin
of
the
use
of
unauthorised
supporters
at
the
present
day
lies
in
the
fact
that
grants
of
supporters
personal
to
the
grantee
for
his
life
only
have
been
made
to
knights
grand
cross
or
to
life
peers
in
cases
where
a
hereditary
title
has
been
subsequently
conferred
the
limitations
of
the
grant
of
supporters
having
never
been
extended
the
grant
has
naturally
expired
with
the
death
of
the
life
honour
to
which
the
supporters
were
attached
in
addition
to
these
cases
there
is
a
very
limited
number
of
families
which
have
always
claimed
supporters
by
prescriptive
right
amongst
whom
may
be
mentioned
tichborne
of
tichborne
two
lions
guardant
gules
de
hoghton
of
hoghton
two
bulls
argent
scroope
of
danby
two
choughs
and
stapylton
concerning
such
cases
it
can
only
be
said
that
in
england
no
official
sanction
has
ever
been
given
to
such
use
and
no
case
exists
of
any
official
recognition
of
the
right
of
an
untitled
family
to
bear
supporters
to
their
arms
save
those
few
exceptional
cases
governed
by
specific
royal
warrants
in
many
cases
notably
scroope
luttrel
hilton
and
stapylton
the
supporters
have
probably
originated
in
their
legitimate
adoption
at
an
early
period
in
connection
with
peerage
or
other
titular
distinction
and
have
continued
inadvertently
in
use
when
the
titular
distinctions
to
which
they
belonged
have
ceased
to
exist
or
have
devolved
upon
other
families
possibly
their
use
in
some
cases
has
been
the
result
of
a
to
honours
the
cases
where
supporters
are
claimed
by
prescriptive
right
are
few
indeed
in
england
and
need
not
be
further
considered
whilst
the
official
laws
in
ireland
are
and
have
apparently
always
been
the
same
as
in
england
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
heads
of
the
different
septs
assert
a
claim
to
the
right
to
use
supporters
on
this
point
sir
bernard
burke
ulster
king
of
arms
wrote
no
registry
of
supporters
to
an
irish
chieftain
appears
in
ulster
office
in
right
of
his
chieftaincy
only
and
without
the
honour
of
peerage
nor
does
any
authority
to
bear
them
exist
but
nevertheless
the
uses
dexter
a
lion
guardant
and
sinister
a
griffin
the
uses
dexter
a
lion
and
sinister
a
horse
the
uses
two
lions
or
the
don
however
is
in
the
unique
position
of
bearing
supporters
by
unquestionable
right
inasmuch
as
the
late
queen
victoria
on
the
occasion
of
her
last
visit
to
dublin
issued
her
royal
warrant
conferring
the
right
upon
him
the
supporters
granted
to
him
were
two
lions
rampant
gules
each
gorged
with
an
antique
crown
and
charged
on
the
shoulder
with
an
irish
harp
or
the
right
to
bear
supporters
in
scotland
is
on
a
widely
different
basis
from
that
in
any
other
country
as
in
england
and
ireland
peers
and
knights
grand
cross
are
permitted
to
obtain
grants
of
these
distinctions
but
outside
and
beyond
these
there
are
many
other
families
who
bear
them
by
right
at
the
official
inquiry
concerning
the
lyon
office
the
george
tait
put
in
a
note
of
persons
whom
he
considered
might
lawfully
bear
supporters
under
scottish
heraldic
law
the
following
is
the
text
of
the
note
in
question
note
of
persons
who
are
considered
by
george
tait
to
be
entitled
to
supporters
furnished
to
the
commissioners
of
inquiry
by
their
desire
intimated
to
him
at
his
examination
this
day
june
by
immemorial
usage
peers
have
right
to
supporters
and
supporters
are
commonly
inserted
in
modern
patents
of
peerage
this
includes
peeresses
in
their
own
right
those
private
gentlemen
and
the
lawful
of
their
bodies
who
can
prove
immemorial
usage
of
carrying
supporters
or
a
usage
very
ancient
and
long
prior
to
the
act
are
entitled
to
have
their
supporters
recognised
it
being
presumed
that
they
received
them
from
lawful
authority
on
account
of
feats
of
valour
in
battle
or
in
tournament
or
as
marks
of
the
royal
favour
see
of
touchadam
june
lawful
of
the
bodies
of
the
smaller
barons
who
had
the
full
right
of
free
barony
not
mere
freeholders
prior
to
when
representation
of
the
minor
barons
was
fully
established
upon
the
ground
that
those
persons
were
barons
and
sat
in
parliament
as
such
and
were
of
the
same
as
the
titled
barons
their
right
is
recognised
by
the
writers
on
heraldry
and
antiquities
persons
having
right
on
this
ground
will
almost
always
have
established
it
by
ancient
usage
and
the
want
of
usage
is
a
strong
presumption
against
the
right
lawful
of
chiefs
of
tribes
or
clans
which
had
attained
power
and
extensive
territories
and
numerous
members
at
a
distant
period
or
at
least
of
tribes
consisting
of
numerous
families
of
some
degree
of
rank
and
consideration
such
persons
will
in
general
have
right
to
supporters
either
as
barons
great
or
small
or
by
ancient
usage
when
any
new
claim
is
set
up
on
such
a
ground
it
may
be
viewed
with
suspicion
and
it
will
be
extremely
difficult
to
establish
it
chiefly
from
the
present
state
of
society
by
which
the
traces
of
clanship
or
the
patriarchal
state
are
in
most
parts
of
the
country
almost
obliterated
and
indeed
it
is
very
difficult
to
conceive
a
case
in
which
a
new
claim
of
that
kind
could
be
admitted
tait
has
had
some
such
claims
and
has
rejected
them
knights
of
the
garter
and
bath
and
any
others
to
whom
the
king
may
think
proper
to
concede
the
honour
of
supporters
these
are
the
only
descriptions
of
persons
who
appear
to
tait
to
be
entitled
to
supporters
an
idea
has
gone
abroad
that
scots
baronets
are
entitled
to
supporters
but
there
is
no
authority
for
this
in
their
patents
or
any
good
authority
for
it
elsewhere
and
for
many
years
subsequent
to
a
very
small
portion
indeed
of
their
arms
which
are
matriculated
in
the
lyon
register
are
matriculated
with
supporters
so
small
as
necessarily
to
lead
to
this
inference
that
those
whose
arms
are
entered
with
supporters
had
right
to
them
on
other
grounds
ancient
usage
chieftainship
or
being
heirs
of
barons
the
arms
of
few
scots
baronets
are
matriculated
during
the
last
fifty
or
sixty
years
but
the
practice
of
assigning
supporters
gradually
gained
ground
during
that
time
or
rather
the
practice
of
assigning
supporters
to
them
merely
as
such
seems
to
have
arisen
during
that
period
and
it
appears
to
tait
to
be
an
erroneous
practice
which
he
would
not
be
warranted
in
following
british
baronets
have
also
by
recent
practice
had
supporters
assigned
to
them
but
tait
considers
the
practice
to
be
unwarranted
and
accordingly
in
a
recent
case
a
gentleman
upon
being
created
a
baronet
applied
for
supporters
to
the
king
having
applied
to
tait
and
been
informed
by
him
that
he
did
not
conceive
the
lord
lyon
entitled
to
give
supporters
to
british
baronets
no
females
except
peeresses
in
their
own
right
are
entitled
to
supporters
as
the
representation
of
families
is
only
in
the
male
line
but
the
widows
of
peers
by
courtesy
carry
their
arms
and
supporters
and
the
sons
of
peers
using
the
lower
titles
of
the
peerage
by
courtesy
also
carry
the
supporters
by
courtesy
tait
does
not
know
of
any
authority
for
the
lord
lyon
having
a
discretionary
power
of
granting
supporters
and
understands
that
only
the
king
has
such
a
power
humbly
submitted
by
signed
g
tait
though
this
statement
would
give
a
good
general
idea
of
the
scottish
practice
its
publication
entails
the
addition
of
certain
qualifying
remarks
supporters
are
most
certainly
not
commonly
inserted
in
modern
patents
of
peerage
supporters
appertaining
to
peerages
are
granted
by
special
and
separate
patents
these
to
english
subjects
are
now
under
the
hand
and
seal
of
garter
alone
in
the
event
of
a
grant
following
upon
the
creation
of
an
irish
peerage
the
patent
of
supporters
would
be
issued
by
ulster
king
of
arms
but
it
is
competent
to
lyon
king
of
arms
to
matriculate
the
arms
of
scottish
peers
with
supporters
or
to
grant
these
to
such
as
may
still
be
without
them
both
lyon
and
ulster
would
appear
to
have
the
right
to
grant
supporters
to
peers
of
the
united
kingdom
who
are
heraldically
their
domiciled
subjects
with
regard
to
the
second
paragraph
of
tait
memorandum
there
will
be
few
families
within
its
range
who
will
not
be
included
within
the
range
of
the
paragraph
which
follows
and
the
presumption
would
rather
be
that
the
use
of
supporters
by
an
untitled
family
originated
in
the
right
of
barony
than
in
any
mythical
grant
following
upon
mythical
feats
of
valour
tait
however
is
clearly
wrong
in
his
statement
that
no
females
except
peeresses
in
their
own
right
are
entitled
to
supporters
they
have
constantly
been
allowed
to
the
heir
of
line
and
their
devolution
through
female
heirs
must
of
necessity
presuppose
the
right
thereto
of
the
female
heir
through
whom
the
inheritance
is
claimed
a
recent
case
in
point
occurs
with
regard
to
the
arms
of
matriculated
in
being
the
heir
of
line
of
hunter
of
hunterston
widows
of
peers
providing
they
have
arms
of
their
own
to
impale
with
those
of
their
husbands
can
not
be
said
to
only
bear
the
supporters
of
their
deceased
husbands
by
courtesy
with
them
it
is
a
matter
of
right
the
eldest
sons
of
peers
bearing
courtesy
titles
most
certainly
do
not
bear
the
supporters
of
the
peerage
to
which
they
are
heirs
even
the
far
more
generally
accepted
courtesy
practice
of
bearing
coronets
is
expressly
forbidden
by
an
warrant
consequently
it
may
be
asserted
that
the
laws
concerning
the
use
of
supporters
in
scotland
are
as
follows
in
the
first
place
no
supporters
can
be
borne
of
right
unless
they
have
been
the
subject
of
formal
grant
or
matriculation
the
following
classes
are
entitled
to
obtain
upon
payment
of
the
necessary
fees
the
grant
or
matriculation
of
supporters
to
themselves
or
to
themselves
and
their
descendants
according
as
the
case
may
be
peers
of
scotland
and
other
peers
who
are
domiciled
scotsmen
knights
of
the
garter
knights
of
the
thistle
and
knights
of
patrick
being
scotsmen
are
entitled
as
such
to
obtain
grants
of
supporters
to
themselves
for
use
during
life
but
as
these
three
orders
are
now
confined
to
members
of
the
peerage
the
supporters
used
would
be
probably
those
appertaining
to
their
peerages
and
it
is
unlikely
that
any
further
grants
for
life
will
be
made
under
these
circumstances
knights
of
the
bath
until
the
revision
of
the
order
were
entitled
to
obtain
grants
of
supporters
to
themselves
for
use
during
their
lifetimes
and
there
are
many
instances
in
the
lyon
register
where
such
grants
have
been
made
knights
grand
cross
of
the
bath
of
michael
and
george
and
of
the
royal
victorian
order
and
knights
grand
commanders
of
the
orders
of
the
star
of
india
and
of
the
indian
empire
are
entitled
to
obtain
grants
of
supporters
for
use
during
their
lifetimes
the
lawful
heirs
of
the
minor
barons
who
had
the
full
right
of
free
barony
prior
to
may
matriculate
supporters
if
they
can
show
their
ancestors
used
them
or
may
now
obtain
grants
though
practically
the
whole
of
these
have
been
at
some
time
or
other
matriculated
in
lyon
register
there
still
remain
a
few
whose
claims
have
never
been
officially
adjudicated
upon
for
example
it
is
only
quite
recently
that
the
ancient
swinton
supporters
have
been
formally
enrolled
on
the
official
records
plate
there
are
certain
others
being
chiefs
of
clans
and
the
heirs
of
those
to
whom
grants
have
been
made
in
times
past
who
also
have
the
right
but
as
no
new
claim
is
likely
to
be
so
recognised
in
the
future
it
may
be
taken
that
these
are
confined
to
those
cases
which
have
been
already
entered
in
the
lyon
register
during
the
latter
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
executive
of
lyon
office
had
fallen
into
great
disrepute
the
office
of
lyon
king
of
arms
had
been
granted
to
the
earls
of
kinnoul
who
had
contented
themselves
with
appointing
deputies
and
drawing
fees
the
whole
subject
of
armorial
jurisdiction
in
scotland
had
become
lax
to
the
last
degree
and
very
many
irregularities
had
crept
in
one
and
probably
the
worst
result
had
been
the
granting
of
supporters
in
many
cases
where
no
valid
reason
other
than
the
payment
of
fees
could
be
put
forward
to
warrant
the
obtaining
of
such
a
privilege
and
the
result
was
the
growth
and
acceptance
of
the
fixed
idea
that
it
was
within
the
power
of
lyon
king
of
arms
to
grant
supporters
to
any
one
whom
he
might
choose
to
so
favour
consequently
many
grants
of
supporters
were
placed
upon
the
records
and
many
untitled
families
of
scotland
apparently
have
the
right
under
these
patents
of
grant
to
add
supporters
to
their
arms
though
it
is
an
arguable
matter
whether
the
lord
lyon
was
justified
in
making
these
grants
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
so
long
as
they
remain
upon
the
official
register
and
no
official
steps
are
taken
to
cancel
the
patents
they
must
be
accepted
as
existing
by
legal
right
probably
the
most
egregious
instance
of
such
a
grant
is
to
be
found
in
the
case
of
the
grant
to
the
first
baronet
of
the
family
of
antrobus
who
on
purchasing
the
estate
of
rutherford
the
seat
of
the
extinct
lords
rutherford
obtained
from
the
then
lyon
king
of
arms
a
grant
of
the
peerage
supporters
carried
by
the
previous
owners
of
the
property
with
regard
to
the
devolution
of
scottish
supporters
the
large
proportion
of
those
registered
in
lyon
office
are
recorded
in
the
terms
of
some
patent
which
specifies
the
limitations
of
their
descent
so
that
there
are
a
comparatively
small
number
only
concerning
which
there
can
be
any
uncertainty
as
to
whom
the
supporters
will
descend
to
the
difficulty
can
only
arise
in
those
cases
in
which
the
arms
are
matriculated
with
supporters
as
borne
by
ancient
usage
in
the
early
years
of
the
lyon
register
or
in
the
cases
of
supporters
still
to
be
matriculated
on
the
same
grounds
by
those
families
who
have
so
far
failed
to
comply
with
the
act
of
whilst
tait
in
his
memorandum
which
has
been
previously
quoted
would
deny
the
right
of
inheritance
to
female
heirs
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
in
many
cases
such
heirs
have
been
allowed
to
succeed
to
the
supporters
of
their
families
taking
supporters
as
an
appanage
of
right
of
barony
either
greater
or
lesser
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
greater
baronies
and
consequently
the
supporters
attached
to
them
devolved
upon
heirs
female
and
upon
the
heir
of
line
inheriting
through
a
female
ancestor
and
presumably
the
same
considerations
must
of
necessity
hold
good
with
regard
to
those
supporters
which
are
borne
by
right
of
lesser
barony
for
the
greater
and
the
lesser
were
the
same
thing
differing
only
in
degree
until
in
the
year
the
lesser
barons
were
relieved
of
compulsory
attendance
in
parliament
at
the
same
time
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
headship
of
a
family
must
rest
with
the
heir
male
and
consequently
it
would
seem
that
in
those
cases
in
which
the
supporters
are
borne
by
right
of
being
head
of
a
clan
or
chief
of
a
name
the
right
of
inheritance
would
devolve
upon
the
heir
male
there
must
of
necessity
be
some
cases
in
which
it
is
impossible
to
determine
whether
the
supporters
were
originally
called
into
being
by
right
of
barony
or
because
of
chieftainship
and
the
consequence
has
been
that
concerning
the
descent
of
the
supporters
of
the
older
untitled
families
there
has
been
no
uniformity
in
the
practice
of
lyon
office
and
it
is
impossible
from
the
precedents
which
exist
to
deduce
any
certain
and
unalterable
rule
upon
the
point
precedents
exist
in
each
case
and
the
case
of
and
which
is
often
referred
to
as
settling
the
point
did
nothing
of
the
kind
inasmuch
as
that
judgment
depended
upon
the
interpretation
of
a
specific
act
of
parliament
and
was
not
the
determination
of
a
point
of
heraldic
law
the
case
however
afforded
the
opportunity
to
lord
jeffrey
to
make
the
following
remarks
upon
the
point
see
seton
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
take
a
view
i
should
say
that
there
is
neither
an
inflexible
rule
nor
a
uniform
practice
in
the
matter
there
may
be
cases
where
the
heir
of
line
will
exclude
the
heir
male
and
there
may
be
cases
where
the
converse
will
be
held
in
my
opinion
the
rule
is
that
the
chief
armorial
dignities
should
follow
the
more
substantial
rights
and
dignities
of
the
family
the
heir
male
succeed
to
the
title
and
estates
i
think
it
reasonable
that
he
should
also
succeed
to
the
armorial
bearings
of
the
head
of
the
i
would
think
it
a
very
difficult
proposition
to
establish
that
the
heir
of
line
when
denuded
of
everything
else
was
still
entitled
to
retain
the
barren
honours
of
heraldry
but
i
give
no
opinion
upon
that
point
seton
in
his
law
and
practice
of
heraldry
in
scotland
sums
up
the
matter
of
inheritance
in
these
words
see
as
already
indicated
however
by
one
of
the
learned
lords
in
his
opinion
on
the
case
of
cuninghame
the
practice
in
the
matter
in
question
has
been
far
from
uniform
and
accordingly
we
are
very
much
disposed
to
go
along
with
his
relative
suggestion
that
chief
armorial
dignities
should
follow
the
more
substantial
rights
and
dignities
of
the
family
and
that
when
the
latter
are
enjoyed
by
the
female
heir
of
line
such
heir
should
also
be
regarded
as
fairly
entitled
to
claim
the
principal
heraldic
honours
the
result
has
been
in
practice
that
the
supporters
of
a
family
have
usually
been
matriculated
to
whoever
has
carried
on
the
name
and
line
of
the
house
unless
the
supporters
in
question
have
been
governed
by
a
specific
grant
the
limitations
of
which
exist
to
be
referred
to
but
in
cases
where
both
the
heir
of
line
and
the
heir
male
have
been
left
in
a
prominent
position
the
difficulty
of
decision
has
in
many
cases
been
got
over
by
allowing
supporters
to
both
of
them
the
most
curious
instance
of
this
within
our
knowledge
occurs
with
regard
to
the
family
of
chisholm
chisholm
of
erchless
castle
appears
undoubtedly
to
have
succeeded
as
head
and
chief
of
his
name
the
chisholm
about
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
as
such
supporters
were
carried
namely
on
either
side
a
savage
wreathed
about
the
head
and
middle
with
laurel
and
holding
a
club
over
his
exterior
shoulder
at
the
death
of
alexander
chisholm
the
chisholm
february
the
chieftainship
and
the
estates
passed
to
his
william
but
his
heir
of
line
was
his
only
child
mary
who
married
james
gooden
of
london
mary
chisholm
or
gooden
in
matriculated
the
arms
of
chisholm
gules
a
boar
head
couped
or
without
supporters
but
in
the
heir
male
matriculated
the
same
arms
in
this
case
with
supporters
the
chieftainship
of
the
chisholm
family
then
continued
with
the
male
line
until
the
death
of
duncan
macdonell
chisholm
the
chisholm
in
when
his
only
sister
and
heir
became
heir
of
line
of
the
later
chiefs
she
was
then
jemima
batten
and
by
royal
licence
in
that
year
she
and
her
husband
assumed
the
additional
surname
of
chisholm
becoming
and
contrary
to
the
english
practice
in
such
cases
the
arms
of
chisholm
were
matriculated
in
to
and
her
descendants
these
once
again
were
the
coat
of
chisholm
viz
gules
a
boar
head
couped
or
arms
for
batten
have
since
been
granted
in
england
the
domicile
of
the
family
being
english
and
the
arms
of
the
present
though
including
the
quartering
for
chisholm
is
usually
marshalled
as
allowed
in
the
college
of
arms
by
english
rules
though
there
does
not
appear
to
have
been
any
subsequent
rematriculation
in
favour
of
the
heir
male
who
succeeded
as
the
chisholm
the
undifferenced
arms
were
also
considered
to
have
devolved
upon
him
together
with
the
supporters
on
the
death
of
the
last
known
male
heir
of
the
family
roderick
donald
matheson
chisholm
the
chisholm
in
james
chisholm
claimed
the
chieftainship
as
heir
of
line
and
in
that
year
the
arms
were
again
rematriculated
in
this
case
supporters
were
added
to
the
again
undifferenced
arms
of
chisholm
but
a
slight
alteration
in
the
supporters
was
made
the
clubs
being
reversed
and
placed
to
rest
on
the
ground
amongst
the
many
other
untitled
scottish
families
who
rightly
bear
supporters
may
be
mentioned
gibsone
of
pentland
barclay
of
urie
barclay
of
towie
drummond
of
megginch
maclachlan
of
that
ilk
cluny
macpherson
cunninghame
and
brisbane
of
that
ilk
armorial
matters
in
the
channel
islands
present
a
very
unsatisfactory
state
of
affairs
there
never
appears
to
have
been
any
visitation
and
the
arms
of
channel
island
families
which
officially
pass
muster
must
be
confined
to
those
of
the
very
few
families
for
example
de
carteret
dobrée
and
tupper
who
have
found
it
necessary
or
advisable
on
their
own
initiative
to
register
their
arms
in
the
official
english
sources
in
none
of
these
instances
have
supporters
been
allowed
nor
i
believe
did
any
of
these
families
claim
to
use
them
but
some
lemprière
de
saumerez
and
other
families
assert
the
possession
of
such
a
distinction
by
prescriptive
right
if
the
right
to
supporters
be
a
privilege
of
peerage
or
if
as
in
scotland
it
anciently
depended
upon
the
right
of
free
barony
the
position
of
these
channel
island
families
in
former
days
as
seignorial
lords
was
much
akin
but
it
is
highly
improbable
that
the
right
to
bear
supporters
in
such
cases
will
ever
be
officially
recognised
and
the
case
of
de
saumerez
in
which
the
supporters
were
bedevilled
and
regranted
to
descend
with
the
peerage
will
probably
operate
as
a
decisive
precedent
upon
the
point
and
against
such
a
right
there
are
some
number
of
families
of
foreign
origin
who
bear
supporters
or
claim
them
by
the
assertion
of
foreign
right
where
this
right
can
be
established
their
use
has
been
confirmed
by
royal
licence
in
this
country
in
some
number
of
cases
for
example
the
cases
of
rothschild
and
de
salis
in
other
cases
for
example
the
case
of
chamier
no
official
record
of
the
supporters
exists
with
the
record
of
the
arms
and
presumably
the
foreign
right
to
the
supporters
could
not
have
been
established
at
the
time
of
registration
with
regard
to
impersonal
arms
the
right
to
supporters
in
england
is
not
easy
to
define
in
the
case
of
counties
crests
and
supporters
are
granted
if
the
county
likes
to
pay
for
them
in
the
case
of
towns
the
rule
in
england
is
that
an
ordinary
town
may
not
have
supporters
but
that
a
city
may
and
instances
are
numerous
where
supporters
have
been
granted
upon
the
elevation
of
a
town
to
the
dignity
of
a
city
birmingham
sheffield
and
nottingham
are
all
recent
instances
in
point
this
rule
however
is
not
absolutely
rigid
and
an
exception
may
be
pointed
to
in
the
case
of
liverpool
the
supporters
being
granted
in
and
the
town
not
being
created
a
city
until
a
subsequent
date
in
scotland
where
of
course
until
quite
recently
supporters
were
granted
practically
to
anybody
who
chose
to
pay
for
them
a
grant
will
be
found
for
the
county
of
perth
dated
in
in
which
supporters
were
included
but
as
to
towns
and
cities
it
is
no
more
than
a
matter
of
fees
any
town
in
scotland
eligible
for
arms
being
at
liberty
to
obtain
supporters
also
if
they
are
desired
in
grants
of
arms
to
corporate
bodies
it
is
difficult
to
draw
the
line
or
to
deduce
any
actual
rule
in
of
henry
viii
the
livery
company
were
granted
two
griffins
per
fess
gules
and
or
and
many
other
of
the
livery
companies
have
supporters
to
their
arms
others
for
no
apparent
reason
are
without
them
the
merchant
adventurers
company
or
hamburg
merchants
have
supporters
as
had
both
the
old
and
the
new
east
india
companies
the
arms
of
jamaica
and
cape
colony
and
of
the
british
north
borneo
company
have
supporters
but
on
the
other
hand
no
supporters
were
assigned
to
canada
or
to
any
of
its
provinces
in
ireland
the
matter
appears
to
be
much
upon
the
same
footing
as
in
england
and
as
far
as
impersonal
arms
are
concerned
it
is
very
difficult
to
say
what
the
exact
rule
is
if
this
is
to
be
deduced
from
known
cases
and
past
precedents
probably
the
freedom
amounting
in
many
cases
to
great
laxity
with
which
in
english
heraldic
art
the
positions
and
attitudes
of
supporters
are
changed
is
the
one
point
in
which
english
heraldic
art
has
entirely
ignored
the
trammels
of
conventionalised
officialism
there
must
be
in
this
country
scores
of
entrance
gates
where
each
pillar
of
the
gateway
is
surmounted
by
a
shield
held
in
the
paws
of
a
single
supporter
and
the
governmental
use
of
the
royal
supporters
in
an
amazing
variety
of
attitudes
some
of
which
are
grossly
unheraldic
has
not
helped
towards
a
true
understanding
the
reposeful
attitude
of
watchful
slumber
in
which
the
royal
lion
and
unicorn
are
so
often
depicted
may
perhaps
be
in
the
nature
of
submission
to
the
biblical
teaching
of
isaiah
that
the
lion
shall
lie
down
with
the
lamb
and
possibly
therefore
also
with
the
unicorn
in
these
times
of
peace
which
have
succeeded
those
earlier
days
when
the

beat
the

various
exceptions
to

the

however

strange

us

form
these

unfortunately
have
never
been
matriculated
as
the
arms
of
the

really
the
arms
of
the

family
the
attainted
earls
of
kilmarnock
and
consequently
can
hardly
as
yet
be
referred
to
as
a
definite
precedent
because
official
matriculation
might
result
in
a
similar
happening
to
the
change
which
was
made
in
the
case
of
the
arms
of
inverness
in
all
representations
of
the

of

the

in

in

compliance
with
the
act

the
armorial
bearings
of
the
royal
burgh
of
inverness
were
matriculated
the
position
was
altered
to
that
more
usually
employed
for
supporters
the
supporters
always
used
by
sir
john
maxwell
of
pollok
are
two
lions
sejant

these
as
appears
from
an
old
seal
were
in
use
as
far
back
as
the
commencement
of
the
fifteenth
century
but
the
supporters
officially
recorded
for
the
family
are
two
apes
in
english
armory
one
or
two
exceptional
cases
may
be

the

period
as
with
ourselves
being
to
be
met
with
on
seals
as
far
back
as
at
first
they
were
similarly
purely
artistic
adjuncts
but
they
have
retained
much
of
this
character
and
much
of
the
purely
permissive
nature
in
germany
to
the
present
day
it
was
not
until
about
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
that
supporters
were
granted
or
became
hereditary
in
that
country
grants
of
supporters
can
be
found
in
england
at
an
earlier
date
but
such
grants
were
isolated
in
number
nevertheless
supporters
had
become
hereditary
very
soon
after
they
obtained
a
regularly
heraldic
as
opposed
to
a
decorative
footing
their
use
however
was
governed
at
that
period
by
a
greater
freedom
as
to
alteration
and
change
than
was
customary
with
armory
in
general
supporters
were
an
adjunct
of
the
peerage
and
peers
were
not
subject
to
the
visitations
with
his
freedom
from
arrest
his
high
social
position
and
his
many
other
privileges
of
peerage
a
peer
was
too
big
a
person
formerly
to
accept
the
dictatorial
armorial
control
which
the
crown
enforced
upon
lesser
people
short
of
treason
a
peer
in
any
part
of
great
britain
for
most
practical
purposes
of
social
life
was
above
the
ordinary
law
in
actual
fact
it
was
only
the
rights
of
one
peer
as
opposed
to
the
rights
of
another
peer
that
kept
a
lord
of
parliament
under
any
semblance
of
control
when
the
great
lords
of
past
centuries
could
and
did
raise
armies
to
fight
the
king
a
peer
was
hardly
likely
to
nor
did
he
brook
much
interference
of
the
development
of
supporters
in
germany
ströhl
writes
only
very
late
about
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
were
supporters
granted
as
hereditary
but
they
appear
in
the
arms
of
burghers
in
the
first
half
of
the
fifteenth
century
and
the
arms
of
many
towns
also
possess
them
as
decorative
adjuncts
the
first
supporters
were
human
figures
generally
portraits
of
the
themselves
then
women
young
men
and
boys
in
the
second
half
of
the
fourteenth
century

in

frequently
encounters
angels

curling
hair

of

then
later
nude
wild
men
and
women
thickly
covered
with
hair
with
garlands
round
their
loins
and
on
their
heads
the
thick
hairy
covering
of
the
body
in
the
case
of
women
is
only
to
be
met
with
in
the
very
beginning
later
the
endeavour
was
to
approach
the
feminine
ideal
as
nearly
as
possible
and
only
the
garlands
were
retained
to
point
out
the
origin
and
the
home
of
these
figures
at
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
and
in
the
sixteenth
century
there
came
into
fashion
lansquenets
huntsmen
pretty
women
and
girls
both
clothed
and
unclothed
speaking
of
the
present
day
and
from
the
executive
standpoint
he
adds
supporters
with
the
exception
of
flying
angels
should
have
a
footing
on
which
they
can
stand
in
a
natural
manner
whether
it
be
grass
a
pedestal
a
tree
or
line
of
ornament
and
to
place
them
upon
a
ribbon
of
a
motto
is
less
suitable
because
a
thin
ribbon
can
hardly
give
the
impression
of
a
sufficiently
strong
support
for
the
invariably
figures
of
the
men
or
animals
the
supporters
of
the
shield
may
at
the
same
time
be
employed
as
bearers
of
the
helmets
they
bear
the
helmets
either
over
the
head
or
hold
them
in
their
hands
figures
standing
near
the
shield
but
not
holding
or
supporting
it
in
any
way
can
not
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word
be
designated
supporters
such
figures
are
called
or
guardians
human
figures
as
supporters
of
all
figures
employed
as
supporters
probably
human
beings
are
of
most
frequent
occurrence
even
when
those
single
and
double
figures
referred
to
on
an
earlier
page
which
are
not
a
real
part
of
the
heraldic
achievement
are
excluded
from
consideration
the
endless
variety
of
different
figures
perhaps
gives
some
clue
to
the
reason
of
their
frequent
occurrence
though
the
nude

figure
appears
male
upon
the
shield
of
dalziel
and
female
in
the

can
not
call
to

any

in

the

sir

wathen
waller
of
braywick

elaborately

ancient
warriors

word
being
the

over

to
richard
waller
of
groombridge
in
kent
from
which
richard
the
said
sir
jonathan
wathen
waller
is
according
to
the
tradition
of
his
family
descended
this
pedigree
is
set
out
in
burke
peerage
which
assigns
as
arms
to
this
family
the
old
coat
of
waller
of
groombridge
with
the
augmented
crest

considerable
doubt
however
is
thrown
upon
the
descent
by
the
fact
that
in
when
sir
jonathan
then
phipps
obtained
a
royal
licence
to
assume
the
name
and
arms
of
waller
a
very
different
and
much
bedevilled
edition
of
the
arms
and
not
the
real
coat
of
waller
of
groombridge
was
exemplified
to
him
these
supporters
the
grant

quite
sir
jonathan

a
domiciled
englishman

not
appear
in
any
of
the
peerage
books
and
it
is
not
clear
to
what
extent
they
were
ever
made
use
of
but
in
a
painting
which
came
under
my
notice
the
duke
of
orleans
in
his
surcoat
of
france
could
be
observed
handing
his
sword
across
the
front
of
the
escutcheon

sir

the

commonly
known
as

and
the
motto

this
supposition

at
some
time

been
pressed

a

not
a

is
it
an

it

become

enumerate
the
different

when
we
turn
to

as

we
at
once
get
to
a

wider
range

little
can
be
said
concerning

stating
that

usually
rampant

practically
unknown

licence
to

his
claim
to
these
additions
would
not
be
recognised

their
use
no

originated
in
the
fact

it
is
difficult
to
say
for
what
length
of

the
supporters
now
in
use
have
been
adopted
but
he
is
chief
of
his
name
and
the
representative
of
one
of

so
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
supporters
would
be
matriculated
to
him

he
cared
to
apply
those
supporters
in
use
viz

surely
be

if

are
eliminated
the
proportion
of

are

is
not
great

certain
variety

differentiation
is
obtained
by
altering

the
compartment
a
compartment
is
anything
depicted
below
the
shield
as
a
foothold
or
for
the
supporters
or
indeed
for
the
shield
itself
sometimes
it
is
a
fixed
part
of
the
blazon
and
a
constituent
part
of
the
heritable
heraldic
bearings
at
other
times
it
is
a
matter
of
mere
artistic
fancy
and
no
fixed
rules
exist
to
regulate
or
control
nor
even
to
check
the
imagination
of
the
heraldic
artist
the
fact
remains
that
supporters
must
have
something
to
stand
upon
and
if
the
blazon
supplies
nothing
the
discretion
of
the
artist
is
allowed
considerable
laxity
on
the
subject
of
compartments
a
great
deal
of
diversity
of
opinion
exists
there
is
no
doubt
that
in
early
days
and
early
examples
supporters
were
placed
to
stand
upon
some
secure
footing
but
with
the
decadence
of
heraldic
art
in
the
seventeenth
century
came
the
introduction
of
the
gilded
freehand
copy
scroll
with
which
we
are
so
painfully
familiar
which
one
writer
has
aptly
termed
the
heraldic
arising
doubtless
from
and
following
upon
the
earlier
habit
of
balancing
the
supporters
upon
the
unstable
footing
afforded
by
the
edge
of
the
motto
scroll
the
was
probably
accepted
as
less
open
to
objection
it
certainly
was
not
out
of
keeping
with
the
heraldic
art
of
the
period
to
which
it
owed
its
evolution
or
with
the
style
of
armorial
design
of
which
it
formed
a
part
it
still
remains
the
accepted
and
official
style
and
type
in
england
but
scotland
and
ireland
have
discarded
it
and
compartments
in
those
countries
are
now
depicted
of
a
nature
requiring
less
gymnastic
ability
on
the
part
of
the
animals
to
which
they
afford
a
foothold
the
style
of
compartment
is
practically
always
a
matter
of
artistic
taste
and
design
with
a
few
exceptions
it
is
always
entirely
disregarded
in
the
blazon
of
the
patent
and
the
necessity
of
something
for
the
supporters
to
stand
upon
is
as
much
an
understood
thing
as
is
the
existence
of
a
shield
whereon
the
arms
are
to
be
displayed
but
as
the
shape
of
the
shield
is
left
to
the
fancy
of
the
artist
so
is
the
character
of
the
compartment
and
the
lyon
register
nowadays
affords
examples
of
achievements
where
the
supporters
stand
on
rocks
and
flowery
mounds
or
issue
from
a
watery
the
example
set
by
the
lyon
register
has
been
eagerly
followed
by
most
heraldic
artists
illustration
fig
it
is
a
curious
commentary
upon
the
heraldic
art
of
the
close
of
the
eighteenth
and
the
early
part
of
the
nineteenth
centuries
that
whilst
the
gymnastic
capabilities
of
animals
were
admitted
to
be
equal
to
exhibitions
of
balancing
upon
the
ordinary
scroll
these
feats
were
not
considered
practicable
in
the
case
of
human
beings
for
whom
little
square
platforms
were
always
provided
fig
which
represents
the
sinister
supporter
of
lord
scarsdale
viz
the
figure
of
liberality
represented
by
a
woman
habited
argent
mantled
purpure
holding
a
cornucopia
proper
shows
the
method
by
which
platform
accommodation
was
provided
for
human
figures
when
acting
as
supporters
at
the
same
time
this
greater
freedom
of
design
may
occasionally
lead
to
mistakes
in
relation
to
english
supporters
and
their
compartments
following
upon
the
english
practice
already
referred
to
of
differentiating
the
supporters
of
different
families
it
has
apparently
been
found
necessary
in
some
cases
to
place
the
supporters
to
stand
upon
a
definite
object
which
object
is
recited
in
the
blazon
and
becomes
an
integral
and
unchangeable
portion
of
the

the
city
of
norwich
is
not
officially
recognised
as
having
the
right
to
supporters
and
doubtless
those
in
use
have
originated
in
the
old
artistic
custom
previously
referred
to
of
putting

deciphered

result
has
been
that
two

have
been
regularly
adopted
as
the
heraldic
supporters
of
the

the
point
that
renders
them
worthy
of
notice
is
that
they
are
invariably
represented

in
this
case
is
less
a

of

probably
of
all
the
curious
supporters
to
be
found
in
british
armory
those
of
the
city

southampton
plate
vii
must
be
admitted
to
be
the
most
unusual
as
far
as
the
actual
usage
of
the
arms
by
the
corporation
is
concerned
one
seldom
if
ever
sees
more
than
the
simple

three

counterchanged
but
in
the
official
record
of
the
arms
in
one
of
the
visitation
books
a
crest
is
added
namely
upon
a
mount

a

the
shield
in
the
visitation
book
rests
upon
a
mount
vert
issuing
from
waves
of
the
sea
and
thereupon
placed
on
either
side
of
the
escutcheon
a
ship
of
two
masts
at
anchor
the
sails
furled
all
proper
the
round

and
from

masthead
flying
a
banner
of
george
and
upon
the
stern
of
each
vessel
a
lion
rampant
or
supporting
the
escutcheon
from
the
fact
that
in
england
the
compartment
is
so
much
a
matter
of
course
it
is
scarcely
ever
alluded
to
and
the
compartment
is
practically
one
peculiar
to
scottish
heraldry
it
does
not
appear
to
be
a
very
ancient
heraldic
appendage
and
was
probably
found
to
be
a
convenient
arrangement
when
shields
were
depicted
erect
instead
of
couché
so
as
to
supply
a
or
standpoint
for
the
supporters
in
a
few
instances
the
compartment
appears
on
seals
with
couché
shields
on
which
however
the
supporters
are
usually
represented
as
resting
the
sides
of
the
and
bearing
up
the
helmet
and
crest
as
already
mentioned
sir
george
mackenzie
conjectures
that
the
compartment
represents
the
bearer
land
and
territories
though
sometimes
he
adds
it
is
bestowed
in
recompense
of
some
honourable
action
thus
the
earls
of
douglas
are
said
to
have
obtained
the
privilege
of
placing
their
supporters
with
a
pale
of
wood
wreathed
because
the
doughty
lord
in
the
reign
of
king
robert
the
bruce
defeated
the
english
in
jedburgh
forest
and
caused
wreathe
and
impale
during
the
night
that
part
of
the
wood
by
which
he
conjectured
they
might
make
their
escape
such
a
fenced
compartment
appears
on
the
seal
of
james
douglas
second
earl
of
angus
dominus
de
abernethie
et
jedworth
forest
on
that
of
george
douglas
fourth
earl
and
also
on
those
of
several
of
his
successors
in
the
earldom
a
still
earlier
example
however
of
a
compartment
representing
a
park
with
trees
enclosed
by
a
wattled
fence
occurs
on
the
seal
of
walter
stewart
earl
of
atholl
where
the
escutcheon
is
placed
in
the
entrance
to
the
park
between
two
trees
nisbet
refers
to
a
seal
of
william
first
earl
of
douglas
exhibiting
a
single
supporter
a
lion
sitting
on
a
compartment
like
to
a
rising
ground
with
a
tree
growing
out
of
it
and
semé
of
hearts
mullets
and
cross
crosslets
these
being
the
charges
of
douglas
and
mar
in
the
escutcheon
according
to
sir
george
mackenzie
these
compartments
were
usually
allowed
only
to
sovereign
princes
and
he
further
informs
us
that
besides
the
douglases
he
knows
of
no
other
subject
in
britain
except
the
earl
of
perth
whose
arms
stand
upon
a
compartment
in
the
case
of
the
perth
family
the
compartment
consists
of
a
green
hill
or
mount
semé
of
caltraps
or
with
the
relative
motto
gang
warily
above
the
achievement
albeit
of
late
says
mackenzie
compartments
are
become
more
common
and
some
families
in
scotland
have
some
creatures
upon
which
their
achievement
stands
as
the

achievement
has
for
many
hundreds
of

was
given
him
for
his
taking
the
murderer
of
james
i
such
figures
however
as
nisbet
remarks
can
not
properly
be
called
compartments
having
rather
the
character
of
devices
while
in
the
case
of
the
struan
achievement
the
chained
man
would
be
more
accurately
described
as

honourable

chapter
xxviii
mottoes
to
the
uninitiated
the
subject
of
the
motto
of
a
family
has
a
far
greater
importance
than
is
conceded
to
it
by
those
who
have
spent
any
time
in
the
study
of
armory
perhaps
it
may
clear
the
ground
if
the
rules
presently
in
force
are
first
recited
it
should
be
carefully
observed
that
the
status
of
the
motto
is
vastly
different
in
england
and
in
other
countries
except
in
the
cases
of
impersonal
arms
and
not
always
then
the
motto
is
never
mentioned
or
alluded
to
in
the
terms
of
the
patent
in
a
grant
of
arms
in
england
consequently
they
are
not
a
part
of
the
estate
created
by
the
letters
patent
though
if
it
be
desired
a
motto
will
always
be
painted
below
the
emblazonment
in
the
margin
of
the
patent
briefly
speaking
the
position
in
england
with
regard
to
personal
armorial
bearings
is
that
mottoes
are
no
one
is
compelled
to
bear
one
nor
is
any
authority
needed
for
the
adoption
of
a
motto
the
matter
is
left
purely
to
the
personal
pleasure
of
every
individual
but
if
that
person
elects
to
use
a
motto
the
officers
of
arms
are
perfectly
willing
to
paint
any
motto
he
may
choose
upon
his
grant
and
to
add
it
to
the
record
of
his
arms
in
their
books
there
is
no
necessity
expressed
or
implied
to
use
a
motto
at
all
nor
is
the
slightest
control
exercised
over
the
selection
or
change
of
mottoes
though
as
would
naturally
be
expected
the
officers
of
arms
would
decline
to
record
to
any
private
person
any
motto
which
might
have
been
appropriated
to
the
sovereign
or
to
any
of
the
orders
of
knighthood
in
the
same
way
no
control
is
exercised
over
the
position
in
which
the
motto
is
to
be
carried
or
the
manner
in
which
it
is
to
be
displayed
in
scotland
however
the
matter
is
on
an
entirely
different
footing
the
motto
is
included
within
the
terms
of
the
patent
and
is
consequently
made
the
subject
of
grant
it
therefore
becomes
inalienable
and
unchangeable
without
a
rematriculation
and
a
scottish
patent
moreover
always
specifies
the
position
in
which
the
motto
is
to
be
carried
this
is
usually
in
an
escroll
over
the
same
over
the
crest
though
occasionally
it
is
stated
to
be
borne
on
a
compartment
below
the
arms
the
matter
in
ireland
is
not
quite
the
same
as
in
either
scotland
or
england
sometimes
the
motto
is
expressed
in
the
patent
in
fact
this
is
now
the
more
usual
alternative
but
the
rule
is
not
universal
and
to
a
certain
extent
the
english
permissiveness
is
recognised
possibly
the
subject
can
be
summed
up
in
the
remark
that
if
any
motto
has
been
granted
or
is
recorded
with
a
particular
coat
of
arms
in
ireland
it
is
expected
that
that
shall
be
the
motto
to
be
made
use
of
therewith
as
a
general
practice
the
use
of
mottoes
in
england
did
not
become
general
until
the
eighteenth
century
in
fact
there
are
very
few
if
any
grants
of
an
earlier
date
on
which
a
motto
appears
the
majority
well
on
towards
the
latter
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
had
no
motto
added
and
many
patents
are
still
issued
without
such
an
addition
with
rare
exceptions
no
mottoes
are
to
be
met
with
in
the
visitation
books
and
it
does
not
appear
that
at
the
time
of
the
visitations
the
motto
was
considered
to
be
essentially
a
part
of
the
armorial
bearings
the
one
or
two
exceptions
which
i
have
met
with
where
mottoes
are
to
be
found
on
visitation
pedigrees
are
in
every
case
the
arms
of
a
peer
there
are
at
least
two
such
in
the
yorkshire
visitation
of
and
probably
it
may
be
taken
for
granted
that
the
majority
of
peers
at
that
period
had
begun
to
make
use
of
these
additions
to
their
arms
unfortunately
we
have
no
exact
means
of
deciding
the
point
because
peers
were
not
compelled
to
attend
a
visitation
and
there
are
but
few
cases
in
which
the
arms
or
pedigree
of
a
peer
figure
in
the
visitation
books
in
isolated
cases
the
use
of
a
motto
can
however
be
traced
back
to
an
even
earlier
period
there
are
several
instances
to
be
met
with
upon
the
early
garter
plates
many
writers
have
traced
the
origin
of
mottoes
to
the
slogan
or
of
battle
and
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
instances
can
be
found
in
which
an
ancient
has
become
a
family
motto
for
example
one
can
refer
to
the
fitzgerald
other
instances
can
be
found
amongst
some
of
the
highland
families
but
the
fact
that
many
of
ancient
days
never
became
perpetuated
as
mottoes
and
also
the
fact
that
by
far
the
greater
number
of
mottoes
even
at
a
much
earlier
period
than
the
present
day
can
not
by
any
possibility
have
ever
been
used
for
or
have
originated
with
the
purposes
of
inclines
me
to
believe
that
such
a
suggested
origin
for
the
motto
in
general
is
without
adequate
foundation
there
can
be
little
if
any
connection
between
the
as
such
and
the
motto
as
such
the
real
origin
would
appear
to
be
more
correctly
traced
back
to
the
badge
as
will
be
found
explained
elsewhere
the
badge
was
some
simple
device
used
for
personal
and
household
purposes
and
seldom
for
war
except
by
persons
who
used
the
badge
of
the
leader
they
followed
no
man
wore
his
own
badge
in
battle
it
generally
partook
of
the
nature
of
what
ancient
writers
would
term
a
quaint
conceit
and
much
ingenuity
seems
to
have
been
expended
in
devising
badges
and
mottoes
which
should
at
the
same
time
be
distinctive
and
should
equally
be
or
convey
an
index
or
suggestion
of
the
name
and
family
of
the
owner
many
of
these
badges
are
found
in
conjunction
with
words
mottoes
and
phrases
and
as
the
distinction
between
the
badge
in
general
and
the
crest
in
general
slowly
became
less
apparent
they
eventually
in
practice
became
interchangeable
devices
if
the
same
device
did
not
happen
to
be
used
for
both
purposes
consequently
the
motto
from
the
badge
became
attached
to
the
crest
and
was
thence
transferred
to
its
present
connection
with
the
coat
of
arms
just
as
at
the
present
time
a
man
may
and
often
does
adopt
a
maxim
upon
which
he
will
model
his
life
some
pithy
proverb
or
some
trite
observation
without
any
question
or
reference
to
armorial
bearings
so
in
the
old
days
when
learning
was
less
diffuse
and
when
proverbs
and
sayings
had
a
wider
acceptance
and
vogue
than
at
present
did
many
families
and
many
men
adopt
for
their
use
some
form
of
words
we
find
these
words
carved
on
furniture
set
up
on
a
cornice
cut
in
stone
and
embroidered
upon
standards
and
banners
and
it
is
to
this
custom
that
we
should
look
for
the
beginning
of
the
use
of
mottoes
but
because
such
words
were
afterwards
in
later
generations
given
an
armorial
status
it
is
not
justifiable
to
presume
such
status
for
them
from
their
beginnings
the
fact
that
a
man
put
his
badges
on
the
standard
that
he
carried
into
battle
and
with
his
badges
placed
the
mottoes
that
thereto
belonged
has
led
many
people
mistakenly
to
believe
that
these
mottoes
were
for
and
for
use
in
battle
that
was
not
the
case
in
fact
it
seems
more
likely
that
the
bulk
of
the
standards
recorded
in
the
books
of
the
heralds
which
show
a
motto
were
never
carried
in
battle
with
regard
to
the
mottoes
in
use
at
the
moment
some
of
course
can
be
traced
to
a
remote
period
and
many
of
the
later
ones
have
interesting
legends
connected
therewith
of
mottoes
of
this
character
may
be
instanced
the
jour
de
ma
vie
of
west
which
was
formerly
the
motto
of
the
la
warr
family
adopted
to
commemorate
the
capture
of
the
king
of
france
at
the
battle
of
poictiers
there
are
many
other
mottoes
of
this
character
amongst
which
may
be
mentioned
the
grip
fast
of
the
leslies
the
origin
of
which
is
well
known
but
though
many
mottoes
relate
to
incidents
in
the
remote
past
true
or
mythical
the
motto
and
the
incident
are
seldom
contemporary
nothing
would
be
gained
by
a
recital
of
a
long
list
of
mottoes
but
i
can
not
forbear
from
quoting
certain
curious
examples
which
by
their
very
weirdness
must
excite
curiosity
as
to
their
origin
a
family
of
martin
used
the
singular
words
he
who
looks
at
martin
ape
martin
ape
shall
look
at
him
whilst
the
curzons
use
let
curzon
hold
what
curzon
helde
the
cranston
motto
is
still
more
grasping
being
thou
shalt
want
ere
i
want
but
probably
the
motto
of
the
dakyns
is
the
most
mysterious
of
all
strike
dakyns
the
devil
in
the
hempe
the
motto
of
corbet
deus
pascit
corvos
evidently
alludes
to
the
raven
or
ravens
corby
crows
upon
the
shield
the
mottoes
of
trafford
now
thus
and
gripe
griffin
hold
fast
the
curious
pilkington
motto
pilkington
pailedown
the
master
mows
the
meadows
and
the
serva
jugum
of
hay
have
been
the
foundation
of
many
legends
the
fuimus
of
the
bruce
family
is
a
pathetic
allusion
to
the
fact
that
they
were
once
kings
but
the
majority
of
ancient
mottoes
partake
rather
of
the
nature
of
a
pun
upon
the
name
which
fact
is
but
an
additional
argument
towards
the
supposition
that
the
motto
has
more
relation
to
the
badge
than
to
any
other
part
of
the
armorial
bearings
of
mottoes
which
have
a
punning
character
may
be
mentioned
mon
dieu
est
ma
roche
which
is
the
motto
of
roche
lord
fermoy
cavendo
tutus
which
is
the
motto
of
cavendish
forte
scutum
salus
ducum
which
is
the
motto
of
fortescue

is
the
apocryphal
quid

which
theodore

suggested
for

retired
tobacconist
this
punning
character
has
of
late
obtained
much
favour
and
wherever
a
name
lends
itself
to
a
pun
the
effort
seems
nowadays
to
be
made
that
the
motto
shall
be
of
this
nature
perhaps
the
best
pun
which
exists
is
to
be
found
in
the
motto
of
the
barnard
family
who
with

or
and

for

and
the
cave

of
cave
other
mottoes
and
they
are
a
large
proportion
are
of
some
saintly
and
religious
tendency
however
desirable
and
acceptable
they
may
be
and
however
accurately
they
may
apply
to
the
first
possessor
they
sometimes
are
sadly
inappropriate
to
later
and
more
degenerate
successors
in
germany
a
distinction
appears
to
be
drawn
between
their
wahlsprüche
those
which
are
merely
dictated
by
personal
choice
and
the
armorial
mottoes
which
remained
constantly
and
heritably
attached
to
the
armorial
bearings
such
as
the
gott
mit
uns
god
with
us
of
prussia
and
the
nihil
sine
deus
of
hohenzollern
the
initial
or
riddle
mottoes
appear
to
be
peculiar
to
germany
examples
of
these
curiosities
are
the
wie
gott
will
as
god
wills
or
wie
du
willst
as
thou
wilt
which
are
both
frequently
to
be
met
with
the
strange
but

of

full
of
every

or
perhaps
with
more
likelihood
austria

all
the
earth
is
subject
to
austria
the
both
as
a
heraldic
fact
and
as
an
armorial
term
is
peculiar
and
exclusively
so
to
british
and
french
heraldry
the
national
of
france
montjoye
saint
denis
appeared
above
the
pavilion
in
the
old
royal
arms
of
france
and
probably
the
english
royal
motto
dieu
et
mon
droit
is
correctly
traced
to
a
similar
origin
a
distinction
is
still
made
in
modern
heraldry
between
the
and
the
motto
inasmuch
as
it
is
considered
that
the
former
should
always
of
necessity
surmount
the
crest
this
is
very
generally
adhered
to
in
scotland
in
the
cases
where
both
a
motto
and
a
or
as
it
is
frequently
termed
in
that
country
a
slogan
exist
the
motto
contrary
to
the
usual
scottish
practice
being
then
placed
below
the
shield
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
a
general
knowledge
of
this
fact
will
not
however
result
in
the
description
of
every
motto
found
above
a
crest
as
a
and
certainly
the
concentrated
piety
now
so
much
in
favour
in
england
for
the
purposes
of
a
motto
can
be
quite
fitly
left
below
the
shield
artists
do
not
look
kindly
on
the
motto
for
decorative
purposes
it
has
been
usually
depicted
in
heraldic
emblazonment
in
black
letters
upon
a
white
scroll
tinted
and
shaded
with
pink
but
with
the
present
revival
of
heraldic
art
it
has
become
more
general
to
paint
the
motto
ribbon
in
conformity
with
the
colour
of
the
field
the
letters
being
often
shown
thereon
in
gold
the
colour
and
shape
of
the
motto
ribbon
however
are
governed
by
no
heraldic
laws
and
except
in
scottish
examples
should
be
left
as
they
are
purely
unimportant
accessories
of
the
achievement
wholly
at
the
discretion
of
the
artist
chapter
xxix
badges
the
exact
status
of
the
badge
in
this
country
to
which
it
is
peculiar
has
been
very
much
misunderstood
this
is
probably
due
to
the
fact
that
the
evolution
of
the
badge
was
gradual
and
that
its
importance
increased
unconsciously
badges
do
not
formerly
appear
to
have
ever
been
made
the
subjects
of
grants
and
the
instances
which
can
be
referred
to
showing
their
control
or
attempted
control
by
the
crown
in
past
times
are
rare
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
crown
seems
to
have
perhaps
purposely
ignored
them
they
are
not
as
we
know
them
found
in
the
earliest
times
of
heraldry
unless
we
are
to
presume
their
existence
from
early
seals
many
of
which
show
isolated
charges
taken
from
the
arms
for
if
in
the
cases
where
such
charges
appear
upon
the
seals
we
are
to
accept
those
seals
as
proofs
of
the
contemporary
existence
of
those
devices
as
heraldic
badges
we
should
often
be
led
into
strange
conclusions
there
is
no
doubt
that
these
isolated
devices
which
are
met
with
were
not
only
a
part
of
the
arms
but
in
many
cases
the
of
the
arms
devices
possessing
a
more
or
less
personal
and
possessive
character
occur
in
many
cases
before
record
of
the
arms
they
later
developed
into
can
be
traced
this
will
be
noticed
in
relation
to
the
arms
of
swinton
to
which
reference
is
made
elsewhere
if
these
are
badges
then
badges
go
back
to
an
earlier
date
than
arms
such
devices
occur
many
centuries
before
such
a
thing
as
a
shield
of
arms
existed
the
badge
as
we
know
came
into
general
use
about
the
reign
of
edward
that
is
the
heraldic
badge
as
a
separate
matter
having
a
distinct
existence
in
addition
to
concurrent
arms
and
having
at
the
same
time
a
distinctly
heraldic
character
but
long
before
that
date
badges
are
found
with
an
allied
reference
to
a
particular
person
which
very
possibly
are
rightly
included
in
any
enumeration
of
badges
of
such
a
character
is
the
badge
of
the
broom
plant
which
is
found
upon
the
tomb
of
geoffrey
count
of
anjou
from
which
badge
the
name
of
the
plantagenet
dynasty
originated
plantagenet
by
the
way
was
never
a
personal
surname
but
was
the
name
of
the
dynasty
it
is
doubtful
however
if
at
that
early
period
there
existed
much
if
indeed
any
opportunity
for
the
use
of
heraldic
badges
at
the
same
time
as
far
back
as
the
reign
of
richard
and
some
writers
would
take
examples
of
a
still
more
remote
period
these
badges
must
have
been
occasionally
depicted
upon
banners
for
richard
appears
to
have
had
a
dragon
upon
one
of
his
banners
these
banner
decorations
which
at
a
later
date
have
been
often
accepted
as
badges
can
hardly
be
quite
properly
so
described
for
there
are
many
cases
where
no
other
proof
of
usage
can
be
found
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
many
such
are
instances
of
no
more
than
banners
prepared
for
specific
purposes
and
the
record
of
such
and
such
a
banner
can
not
necessarily
carry
proof
that
the
owner
of
the
banner
claimed
or
used
the
objects
depicted
thereupon
as
personal
badges
if
they
are
to
be
so
included
some
individuals
must
have
revelled
in
a
multitude
of
badges
but
the
difficulty
in
deciding
the
point
very
greatly
depends
upon
the
definition
of
the
badge
and
if
we
are
to
take
the
definition
according
to
the
manner
of
acceptance
and
usage
at
the
period
when
the
use
of
badges
was
greatest
then
many
of
the
earliest
can
not
be
taken
as
coming
within
the
limits
in
later
plantagenet
days
badges
were
of
considerable
importance
and
certain
characteristics
are
plainly
marked
they
were
never
worn
by
the
owner
in
the
sense
in
which
he
carried
his
shield
or
bore
his
crest
they
were
his
indicative
of
ownership
they
were
stamped
upon
his
belongings
in
the
same
way
in
which
government
property
is
marked
with
the
broad
arrow
and
they
were
worn
by
his
servants
they
were
worn
not
only
by
his
retainers
but
very
probably
were
also
worn
more
or
less
temporarily
by
adherents
of
his
party
if
he
were
big
enough
to
lead
a
party
in
the
state
at
all
times
badges
had
very
extensive
decorative
use
there
was
never
any
fixed
form
for
the
badge
there
was
never
any
fixed
manner
of
usage
i
can
find
no
fixed
laws
of
inheritance
no
common
method
of
assumption
in
fact
the
use
of
a
badge
in
the
days
when
everybody
who
was
anybody
possessed
arms
was
quite
subsidiary
to
the
arms
and
very
much
akin
to
the
manner
in
which
nowadays
monograms
are
made
use
of
at
the
same
time
care
must
be
taken
to
distinguish
the
badge
from
the
rebus
and
also
from
the
temporary
devices
which
we
read
about
as
having
been
so
often
adopted
for
the
purpose
of
the
tournament
when
the
combatant
desired
his
identity
to
be
concealed
modern
novelists
and
poets
give
us
plenty
of
illustrations
of
the
latter
kind
but
proof
of
the
fact
even
that
they
were
ever
adopted
in
that
form
is
by
no
means
easy
to
find
though
their
professedly
temporary
nature
of
course
militates
against
the
likelihood
of
contemporary
the
rebus
had
never
an
heraldic
status
and
it
had
seldom
more
than
a
temporary
existence
a
fanciful
device
adopted
we
hear
of
many
such
instances
for
the
temporary
purpose
of
a
tournament
could
generally
be
so
classed
but
the
rebus
proper
has
some
device
usually
a
pictorial
rendering
of
the
name
of
the
person
for
whom
it
stood
in
such
a
category
would
be
included
printers
and
marks
but
probably
the
definition
of
johnson
of
the
word
rebus
as
a
word
represented
by
a
picture
is
as
good
a
definition
and
description
as
can
be
given
the
rebus
in
its
nature
is
a
different
thing
from
a
badge
and
may
best
be
described
as
a
pictorial
signature
the
most
frequent
occasion
for
its
use
being
in
architectural
surroundings
where
it
was
constantly
introduced
as
a
pun
upon
some
name
which
it
was
desired
to
perpetuate
the
and
perhaps
the
most
typical
and
characteristic
rebus
is
that
of
islip
the
builder
of
part
of
westminster
abbey
here
the
pictured
punning
representation
of
his
name
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
armorial
bearings
or
personal
badge
but
the
great
difficulty
in
dealing
with
both
badges
and
rebuses
is
the
difficulty
of
knowing
which
is
which
for
very
frequently
the
same
or
a
similar
device
was
used
for
both
purposes
parker
in
his
glossary
of
heraldic
terms
gives
several
typical
examples
of
rebuses
which
very
aptly
illustrate
their
status
and
meaning
at
lincoln
college
at
oxford
and
on
other
buildings
connected
with
thomas
beckynton
bishop
of
bath
and
wells
will
be
found
carved
the
rebus
of
a
beacon
issuing
from
a
tun
this
is
found
in
conjunction
with
the
letter
t
for
his
christian
name
thomas
now
this
design
was
not
his
coat
of
arms
and
was
not
his
crest
nor
was
it
his
badge
another
rebus
which
is
found
at
canterbury
shows
an
ox
and
the
letters
n
e
as
the
rebus
of
john
oxney
a
rebus
which
indicates
thomas
conyston
abbot
of
cirencester
which
can
be
found
in
gloucester
cathedral
is
a
comb
and
a
tun
and
the
printer
mark
of
richard
grifton
which
is
a
good
example
of
a
rebus
and
its
use
was
a
tree
or
graft
growing
on
a
tun
in
none
of
these
cases
are
the
designs
mentioned
on
any
part
of
the
arms
crest
or
badge
of
the
persons
mentioned
rebuses
of
this
character
abound
on
all
our
ancient
buildings
and
their
use
has
lately
come
very
prominently
into
favour
in
connection
with
the
many
allusive
bookplates
the
design
of
which
originates
in
some
play
upon
the
name
the
words
device
ensign
and
cognisance
have
no
definite
heraldic
meaning
and
are
used
impartially
to
apply
to
the
crest
the
badge
and
sometimes
to
the
arms
upon
the
shield
so
that
they
may
be
eliminated
from
consideration
there
remains
therefore
the
crest
and
the
badge
between
which
to
draw
a
definite
line
of
distinction
the
real
difference
lay
in
the
method
of
use
though
there
is
usually
a
difference
of
form
recognisable
by
an
expert
but
difficult
to
put
into
words
the
crest
was
the
ornament
upon
the
helmet
seldom
if
ever
actually
worn
and
never
used
except
by
the
person
to
whom
it
belonged
the
badge
on
the
other
hand
was
never
placed
upon
the
helmet
but
was
worn
by
the
servants
and
retainers
and
was
used
right
and
left
on
the
belongings
of
the
owner
as
a
sign
of
his
ownership
so
great
and
extensive
at
one
period
was
the
use
of
these
badges
that
they
were
far
more
generally
employed
than
either
arms
or
crest
and
whilst
the
knowledge
of
a
man
badge
or
badges
would
be
everyday
knowledge
and
common
repute
throughout
the
kingdom
few
people
would
know
that
man
crest
fewer
still
would
ever
have
seen
it
worn
it
is
merely
an
exaggeration
of
the
difficulty
that
we
are
always
in
uncertainty
whether
any
given
device
was
merely
a
piece
of
decoration
borrowed
from
the
arms
or
crest
or
whether
it
had
continued
usage
as
a
badge
in
the
same
way
many
families
who
had
never
used
crests
but
who
had
used
badges
took
the
opportunity
of
the
visitations
to
record
their
badges
as
crests
a
notable
example
of
the
subsequent
record
of
a
badge
as
a
crest
is
met
with
in
the
stourton
family
their
crest
originally
a
buck
head
but
after
the
marriage
with
the
heiress
of
le
moigne
a
can
be
readily
substantiated
as
can
their
badge
of
the
drag
or
sledge
at
one
of
the
visitations
however
a
cadet
of
the
stourton
family
recorded
the
sledge
as
a
crest
uncertainty
also
arises
from
the
lack
of
precision
in
the
diction
employed
at
all
periods
the
words
badge
device
and
crest
having
so
often
been
used
interchangeably
another
difficulty
which
is
met
with
in
regard
to
badges
is
that
with
the
exception
of
the
extensive
records
of
the
royal
badges
and
some
other
more
or
less
informal
lists
of
badges
of
the
principal
personages
at
different
periods
badges
were
never
a
subject
of
official
record
and
whilst
it
is
difficult
to
determine
the
initial
point
as
to
whether
any
particular
device
is
a
badge
or
not
the
difficulty
of
deducing
rules
concerning
badges
becomes
practically
impossible
and
after
most
careful
consideration
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
were
never
any
hard
and
fast
rules
relating
to
badges
that
they
were
originally
and
were
allowed
to
remain
matters
of
personal
fancy
and
that
although
cases
can
be
found
where
the
same
badge
has
been
used
generation
after
generation
those
cases
may
perhaps
be
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule
badges
should
be
considered
and
accepted
in
the
general
run
as
not
being
matters
of
permanence
and
as
of
little
importance
except
during
the
time
from
about
the
reign
of
edward
iii
to
about
the
reign
of
henry
viii
their
principal
use
upon
the
clothes
of
the
retainers
came
to
an
end
by
the
creation
of
the
standing
army
the
beginning
of
which
can
be
traced
to
the
reign
of
henry
and
as
badges
never
had
any
ceremonial
use
to
perpetuate
their
status
their
importance
almost
ceased
altogether
at
that
period
except
as
regards
the
royal
family
speaking
broadly
regularised
and
heraldic
control
as
a
matter
of
operative
fact
dates
little
if
any
further
back
than
the
end
of
the
reign
of
henry
consequently
badges
originally
do
not
appear
to
have
been
taken
much
cognisance
of
by
the
heralds
their
actual
use
from
that
period
onwards
rapidly
declined
and
hence
the
absence
of
record
though
the
use
of
badges
has
become
very
restricted
there
are
still
one
or
two
occasions
on
which
badges
are
used
as
badges
in
the
style
formerly
in
vogue
perhaps
the
case
which
is
most
familiar
is
the
broad
arrow
which
is
used
to
mark
government
stores
it
is
a
curious
commentary
upon
heraldic
officialdom
and
its
ways
that
though
this
is
the
only
badge
which
has
really
any
extensive
use
it
is
not
a
crown
badge
in
any
degree
although
this
origin
has
been
disputed
it
is
said
to
have
originated
in
the
fact
that
one
of
the
sydney
family
when
master
of
the
ordnance
to
prevent
disputes
as
to
the
stores
for
which
he
was
responsible
marked
everything
with
his
private
badge
of
the
broad
arrow
and
this
private
badge
has
since
remained
in
constant
use
one
wonders
at
what
date
the
officers
of
his
majesty
will
observe
that
this
has
become
one
of
his
majesty
recognised
badges
and
will
include
it
with
the
other
royal
badges
in
the
warrants
in
which
they
are
recited
already
more
than
two
centuries
have
passed
since
it
first
came
into
use
and
either
they
should
represent
to
the
government
that
the
pheon
is
not
a
crown
mark
and
that
some
recognised
royal
badge
should
be
used
in
its
place
or
else
they
should
place
its
status
upon
a
definite
footing
another
instance
of
a
badge
used
at
the
present
day
in
the
ancient
manner
is
the
conjoined
rose
thistle
and
shamrock
which
is
embroidered
front
and
back
upon
the
tunics
of
the
beefeaters
and
the
yeomen
of
the
guard
the
crowned
harps
which
are
worn
by
the
royal
irish
constabulary
are
another
instance
of
the
kind
but
though
a
certain
number
of
badges
are
recited
in
the
warrant
each
time
any
alteration
or
declaration
of
the
royal
arms
occurs
their
use
has
now
become
very
limited
present
badges
are
the
crowned
rose
for
england
the
crowned
thistle
for
scotland
and
the
crowned
trefoil
and
the
crowned
harp
for
ireland
whilst
for
the
union
there
is
the
conjoined
rose
thistle
and
shamrock
under
the
crown
and
the
crowned
shield
which
carries
the
device
of
the
union
jack
the
badge
of
wales
which
has
existed
for
long
enough
is
the
uncrowned
dragon
upon
a
mount
vert
and
the
crowned
cyphers
one
within
and
one
without
the
garter
are
also
depicted
upon
the
warrant
these
badges
which
appear
on
the
sovereign
warrant
are
never
assigned
to
any
other
member
of
the
royal
family
of
whom
the
prince
of
wales
is
the
only
one
who
rejoices
in
the
possession
of
officially
assigned
badges
the
badge
of
the
eldest
son
of
the
sovereign
as
such
and
not
as
prince
of
wales
is
the
plume
of
three
ostrich
feathers
enfiled
with
the
circlet
from
his
coronet
recently
an
additional
badge
on
a
mount
vert
a
dragon
passant
gules
charged
on
the
shoulder
with
a
label
of
three
points
argent
has
been
assigned
to
his
royal
highness
this
action
was
taken
with
the
desire
to
in
some
way
gratify
the
forcibly
expressed
wishes
of
wales
and
it
is
probable
that
the
precedent
having
been
set
it
will
be
assigned
to
all
those
who
may
bear
the
title
of
prince
of
wales
in
future
the
only
instances
i
am
personally
aware
of
in
which
a
real
badge
of
ancient
origin
is
still
worn
by
the
servants
are
the
cases
of
the
state
liveries
of
the
earl
of
yarborough
whose
servants
wear
an
embroidered
buckle
and
of
lord
mowbray
and
stourton
whose
servants
wear
an
embroidered
sledge
the
family
of
daubeney
of
cote
still
bear
the
old
daubeney
badge
of
the
pair
of
bat
wings
lord
stafford
still
uses
his
stafford
knot
i
believe
the
servants
of
lord
braye
still
wear
the
badge
of
the
and
those
of
the
earl
of
loudoun
wear
the
hastings
maunch
and
doubtless
there
are
a
few
other
instances
when
the
old
families
were
becoming
greatly
reduced
in
number
and
the
nobility
and
the
upper
classes
were
being
recruited
from
families
of
later
origin
the
wearing
of
badges
like
so
much
else
connected
with
heraldry
became
lax
in
its
practice
the
servants
of
all
the
great
nobles
in
ancient
days
appear
to
have
worn
the
badges
of
their
masters
in
a
manner
similar
to
the
use
of
the
royal
badge
by
the
yeomen
of
the
guard
although
sometimes
the
badge
was
embroidered
upon
the
sleeve
and
the
wearing
of
the
badge
by
the
retainers
is
the
chief
and
principal
use
to
which
badges
were
anciently
put
nisbet
alludes
on
this
point
to
a
paragraph
from
the
act
for
the
order
of
the
riding
of
parliament
in
which
says
that
the
noblemen
lacqueys
may
have
over
their
liveries
velvet
coats
with
their
badges
their
crests
and
mottoes
done
on
plate
or
embroidered
on
the
back
and
breast
conform
to
ancient
custom
a
curious
survival
of
these
plates
is
to
be
found
in
the
large
silver
plaques
worn
by
so
many
bank
messengers
badges
appear
however
to
have
been
frequently
depicted
semé
upon
the
lambrequins
of
armorial
achievements
as
will
be
seen
from
many
of
the
old
garter
plates
but
here
again
it
is
not
always
easy
to
distinguish
between
definite
badges
and
artistic
decoration
nor
between
actual
badges
in
use
and
mere
appropriately
selected
charges
from
the
shield
the
of
lord
berners
the
knot
of
lord
stafford
popularly
known
as
the
stafford
knot
the
harington
fret
the
ragged
staff
or
the
bear
and
the
ragged
staff
of
lord
warwick
this
being
really
a
conjunction
of
two
separate
devices
the
rose
of
england
the
thistle
of
scotland
and
the
sledge
of
stourton
the
of
lord
braye
wherever
met
with
are
readily
recognised
as
badges
but
there
are
many
badges
which
it
is
difficult
to
distinguish
from
crests
and
even
some
which
in
all
respects
would
appear
to
be
more
correctly
regarded
as
coats
of
arms
it
is
a
point
worthy
of
consideration
whether
or
not
a
badge
needs
a
background
here
again
it
is
a
matter
most
difficult
to
determine
but
it
is
singular
that
in
any
matter
of
the
badge
is
almost
invariably
depicted
upon
a
background
either
of
a
standard
or
a
mantling
or
upon
the
field
of
a
roundel
and
it
may
well
be
that
their
use
in
such
circumstances
as
the
two
cases
first
mentioned
may
have
only
been
considered
correct
when
the
colour
of
the
mantling
or
the
standard
happened
to
be
the
right
colour
for
the
background
of
the
badge
badges
are
most
usually
met
with
in
stained
glass
upon
roundels
of
some
colour
or
colours
and
though
one
would
hesitate
to
assert
it
as
an
actual
fact
there
are
many
instances
which
would
lead
one
to
suppose
that
the
background
of
a
badge
was
usually
the
livery
colour
or
colours
of
its
then
owner
or
of
the
family
from
which
it
was
originally
inherited
certain
is
it
that
there
are
very
few
contemporary
instances
of
badges
which
when
emblazoned
are
not
upon
the
known
livery
colours
and
if
this
fact
be
accepted
then
one
is
perhaps
justified
in
assuming
all
to
be
livery
colours
and
we
get
at
once
a
ready
explanation
on
several
points
which
have
long
puzzled
antiquaries
the
name
of
edward
the
black
prince
has
often
been
a
matter
of
discussion
and
the
children
history
books
tell
us
that
the
nickname
originated
from
the
colour
of
his
armour
this
may
be
true
enough
but
as
most
armour
would
be
black
when
it
was
unpolished
and
as
most
armour
was
either
polished
or
dull
the
probabilities
are
not
very
greatly
in
its
favour
though
there
can
be
found
instances
it
was
not
a
usual
custom
for
any
one
to
paint
his
armour
red
or
green
even
if
the
armour
of
the
prince
were
enamelled
black
it
would
be
so
usually
hidden
by
his
surcoat
that
he
is
hardly
likely
to
have
been
nicknamed
from
it
it
seems
to
me
far
more
probable
that
black
was
the
livery
colour
of
the
black
prince
and
that
his
own
retainers
and
followers
wore
the
livery
of
black
if
that
were
the
case
one
understands
at
once
how
he
would
obtain
the
nickname
the
nickname
is
doubtless
contemporary
a
curious
confirmation
of
my
supposition
is
met
with
in
the
fact
that
his
shield
for
peace
was
sable
three
ostrich
feathers
two
and
one
the
quill
of
each
passing
through
a
scroll
argent
there
we
get
the
undoubted
badge
of
the
ostrich
feather
which
was
originally
borne
singly
depicted
upon
his
livery
colour
black
the
badges
represented
in
prince
arthur
book
in
the
college
of
arms
an
important
source
of
our
knowledge
upon
the
subject
are
all
upon
backgrounds
and
the
curious
divisions
of
the
colours
on
the
backgrounds
would
seem
to
show
that
each
badge
had
its
own
background
several
badges
being
only
met
with
upon
the
same
ground
when
that
happens
to
be
the
true
background
belonging
to
them
but
in
attempting
to
deduce
rules
it
should
be
remembered
that
in
all
and
every
armorial
matter
there
was
greater
laxity
of
rule
at
the
period
of
the
actual
use
of
arms
as
a
reality
of
life
than
it
was
possible
to
permit
when
the
multiplication
of
arms
as
paper
insignia
made
regulation
necessary
and
more
restrictive
so
that
an
occasional
variation
from
any
deduction
need
not
necessarily
vitiate
the
conclusion
even
in
a
matter
exclusively
relating
to
the
shield
how
much
more
then
must
we
remain
in
doubt
when
dealing
with
badges
which
appear
to
have
been
so
largely
a
matter
of
personal
caprice
it
is
a
striking
comment
that
of
all
the
badges
presently
to
be
referred
to
of
the
stafford
family
each
single
one
is
depicted
upon
a
background
it
is
a
noticeable
fact
that
of
the
eighteen
badges
exemplified
as
belonging
to
the
family
of
stafford
nine
are
upon
fields
this
is
not
an
unreasonable
proportion
if
the
fields
are
considered
to
be
the
livery
colours
of
the
families
from
whom
the
badges
were
originally
derived
but
it
is
altogether
out
of
proportion
to
the
number
of
shields
in
any
roll
of
arms
which
would
have
the
field
party
per
pale
or
party
in
any
other
form
of
division
with
the
exception
of
the
second
badge
which
is
on
a
striped
background
of
green
and
white
all
the
party
backgrounds
are
party
per
pale
which
was
the
most
usual
way
of
depicting
a
livery
in
the
few
records
which
have
come
down
to
us
of
the
heraldic
use
of
livery
colours
and
of
the
eighteen
badges
no
less
than
eight
are
upon
a
field
of
which
the
dexter
is
sable
and
the
sinister
gules
scarlet
and
black
are
known
to
have
been
the
livery
colours
of
edward
stafford
duke
of
buckingham
who
was
beheaded
in
the
arms
of
the
town
of
buckingham
are
on
a
field
per
pale
sable
and
gules
with
regard
to
the
descent
of
badges
and
the
laws
which
govern
their
descent
still
less
is
known
the
answer
to
the
question
how
did
badges
descend
is
simple
nobody
knows
one
can
only
hazard
opinions
more
or
less
pious
of
more
or
less
value
it
is
distinctly
a
point
upon
which
it
is
risky
to
be
dogmatic
and
we
must
wait
for
the
development
which
will
follow
the
recent
revival
of
the
granting
of
standards
as
cases
occur
for
decision
precedents
will
be
found
and
disclosed
whilst
the
secrecy
of
the
records
of
the
college
of
arms
is
so
jealously
preserved
it
is
impossible
to
speak
definitely
at
present
for
an
exact
and
comprehensive
knowledge
of
exact
and
authoritative
instances
of
fact
is
necessary
before
a
decision
can
be
definitely
put
forward
unless
some
officer
of
arms
will
carefully
collate
the
information
which
can
be
gleaned
from
the
records
in
the
college
of
arms
which
are
relevant
to
the
subject
it
does
not
seem
likely
that
our
knowledge
will
advance
greatly
the
grant
of
supporters

the
earl

badges
as
exemplified
in
to

it
may
be
of
interest
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
this
exemplification
the
royal
arms
are
displayed
before
those
of
stafford
on
the
face
of
it
the
document
as
far
as
it
relates
to
the
badges
is
no
more
than
a
certificate
or
exemplification
in
which
case
it
is
undoubted
evidence
that
badges
descend
to
the
as
do
quarterings
but
there
is
the
possibility
that
the
document
is
a
in
the
nature
of
an
exemplification
following
a
royal
licence
or
a
to
remove
uncertainty
as
to
the
attainder
and
if
the
document
as
far
as
its
relation
to
the
badges
goes
has
any
of
the
character
of
a
grant
it
can
have
but
little
value
as
evidence
of
the
descent
of
badges
it
is
remarkable
that
it
is
absolutely
silent
as
to
the
future
destination
of
the
badges
the
real
fact
is
that
the
whole
subject
of
the
descent
and
devolution
of
badges
is
shrouded
in
mystery
each
of
the
badges

is
depicted
within
a
circle
adorned

badges
appear
upon
a
portrait
of
edward
duke
of
buckingham
the
fact
that
some
of
these
are
really
crests
depicted
upon
wreaths
goes
far
as
an
authority
for
the
use
of
a
crest
upon
livery
buttons
for
the
purposes
of
a
badge
in
ancient
days
all
records
seemed
to
point
to
the
fact
that
badges
were
personal
and
that
though
they
were
worn
by
the
retainers
they
were
the
property
of
of
the
family
rather
than
as
the
arms
of
the
whole
family
and
though
the
information
available
is
meagre
to
the
last
degree
it
would
appear
probable
that
in
all
cases
where
their
use
by
other
members
of
the
family
than
the
head
of
the
house
can
be
proved
the
likelihood
is
that
the
cadets
would
render
feudal
service
and
would
wear
the
badge
as
retainers
of
the
man
whose
standard
they
followed
into
battle
so
that
we
should
expect
to
find
the
badge
following
the
same
descent
as
the
peerage
together
with
the
lands
and
liabilities
which
accompanied
it
this
undoubtedly
makes
for
the
inheritance
of
a
badge
upon
the
same
line
of
descent
as
a
barony
by
writ
and
such
a
method
of
inheritance
accounts
for
the
known
descent
of
most
of
the
badges
heraldically
familiar
to
us
probably
we
shall
be
right
in
so
accepting
it
as
the
ancient
rule
of
inheritance
but
on
the
other
hand
a
careful
examination
of
the
book
of
standards
now
preserved
in
the
college
of
arms
provides
several
examples
charged
with
marks
of
cadency
but
here
again
one
is
in
ignorance
whether
this
is
an
admission
of
inheritance
by
cadets
or
whether
the
cases
should
be
considered
as
grants
of
differenced
versions
to
cadets
this
then
gives
us
the
badge
the
property
in
and
of
which
would
descend
to
the
and
perhaps
also
to
cadets
whilst
it
would
be
used
if
there
were
no
inherited
right
in
token
of
allegiance
or
service
actual
or
sentimental
by
the
cadets
of
the
house
and
their
servants
for
whilst
the
use
of
the
cockade
is
a
survival
of
the
right
to
be
waited
on
and
served
by
a
soldier
servant
the
use
of
a
badge
by
a
cadet
may
be
a
survival
and
reminder
of
the
day
when
until
they
married
heiresses
and
continued
or
founded
other
families
the
cadets
of
a
house
owed
and
gave
military
service
to
the
head
of
their
own
family
and
in
return
were
supported
by
him
from
the
wording
of
the
recent
grants
of
badges
i
believe
the
intention
however
is
that
the
badge
is
to
descend
of
right
to
all
of
those
people
on
whom
a
right
to
it
would
devolve
if
it
were
a
quartering
the
use
of
badges
having
been
so
limited
the
absence
of
rule
and
regulation
leaves
it
very
much
a
matter
of
personal
taste
how
badges
where
they
exist
shall
be
heraldically
depicted
and
perhaps
it
is
better
to
leave
their
manner
of
display
to
artistic
requirements
the
most
usual
place
when
depicted
in
conjunction
with
an
achievement
is
on
either
side
of
the
crest
and
they
may
well
be
placed
in
that
position
where
they
exist
however
they
ought
undoubtedly
to
be
continued
in
use
upon
the
liveries
of
the
servants
and
the
present
practice
is
for
them
to
be
placed
on
the
livery
buttons
and
embroidered
upon
the
epaulettes
or
on
the
sleeves
of
state
liveries
undoubtedly
the
former
practice
of
placing
the
badge
upon
the
servants
livery
is
the
precursor
of
the
present
vogue
of
placing
crests
upon
livery
buttons
and
many
heraldic
writers
complain
of
the
impropriety
of
placing
the
crest
in
such
a
position
i
am
not
sure
that
i
myself
may
not
have
been
guilty
in
this
way
but
when
one
bears
in
mind
the
number
of
cases
in
which
the
badge
and
the
crest
are
identical
and
when
as
in
the
above
instance
devices
which
are
undoubtedly
crests
are
exemplified
as
and
termed
badges
even
as
such
being
represented
upon
wreaths
and
even
in
that
form
granted
upon
standards
whilst
in
other
cases
the
action
has
been
the
reverse
it
leaves
one
under
the
necessity
of
being
careful
in
making
definite
assertions
having
dealt
with
the
laws
if
there
ever
were
any
and
the
practice
concerning
the
use
and
display
of
badges
in
former
days
it
will
be
of
interest
to
notice
some
of
those
which
were
anciently
in
use
i
have
already
referred
to
the
badge
of
the
ostrich
feathers
now
borne
exclusively
by
the
to
the
throne
the
old
legend
that
the
black
prince
won
the
badge
at
the
battle
of
crecy
by
the
capture
of
john
king
of
bohemia
together
with
the
motto
ich
dien
has
been
long
since
exploded
sir
harris
nicolas
brought
to
notice
the
fact
that
among
certain
pieces
of
plate
belonging
to
queen
philippa
of
hainault
was
a
large
dish
enamelled
with
a
black
escutcheon
with
ostrich
feathers
vuo
scuch
nigro
cum
pennis
de
ostrich
and
upon
the
strength
of
that
suggested
that
the
ostrich
feather
was
probably
originally
a
badge
of
the
counts
of
hainault
derived
from
the
county
of
ostrevaus
a
title
which
was
held
by
their
eldest
sons
the
suggestion
in
itself
seems
probable
enough
and
may
be
correct
but
it
would
not
account
for
the
use
of
the
ostrich
feathers
by
the
mowbray
family
who
did
not
descend
from
the
marriage
of
edward
iii
and
philippa
of
hainault
contemporary
proof
of
the
use
of
badges
is
often
difficult
to
find
the
mowbrays
had
many
badges
and
certainly
do
not
appear
to
have
made
any
very
extensive
use
of
the
ostrich
feathers
but
there
seems
to
be
very
definite
authority
for
the
existence
of
the
badge
there
is
in
one
of
the
records
of
the
college
of

which
is
itself

the

family
bore
the
badge
by
subsequent
grant
and
authorisation
and
not
on
the
simple
basis
of
inheritance
an
ostrich
feather
piercing
a
scroll
was
certainly
the
favourite
badge
of
the
black
prince
and
so
appears
on
several
of
his
seals
and
triplicated
it
occurs
on
his
shield
of
peace

which
set
up
under
the
instructions
in

his
monument
in
canterbury
cathedral
the
arms
of
sir
roger
de
clarendon
the
illegitimate
son
of
the
black
prince
were
derived
from
this
shield
for
peace
which
i
take
it
was
not
really
a
coat
of
arms
at
all
but
merely
the
badge
of
the
prince
depicted
upon
his
livery
colour
and
which
might
equally
have
been
displayed
upon
a
roundle
in
the
form
of
a
shield
bearing
three
feathers
the
badge
occurs
on
the
obverse
of
the
second
seal
of
henry
iv
in
a
single
ostrich
feather
with
the
motto
ich

upon
the

is
to
be
seen
on
the

edward

was
killed

the
battle
of
agincourt

ostrich

john

used
the
badge
with
a
chain
laid
along
the
quill
and
thomas
duke
of
gloucester
used
it
with
a
garter
and
buckle
instead
of
the
chain
whilst
john
beaufort

placed
an
ostrich
feather
on

quills

his
case

illustration
fig
seal
of
king
james
ii
for

duchy

there
is
a
note
in
harl
folio
which
if
it
be
strictly
accurate
is
of
some
importance
it
is
to
the
effect
that
the
feather
silver
with
the
pen
gold
is
the
king
the
ostrich
feather
pen
and
all
silver
is
the
prince
the
prince
of
wales
and
the
ostrich
feather
gold
the
pen
ermine
is
the
duke
of
lancaster
that
statement
evidently
relates
to
a
time
when
the
three
were
in
existence
contemporaneously
before
the
accession
of
henry
iv
in
the
reign
of
richard
ii
there
was
no
prince
of
wales
during
the
reign
of
edward
iii
from
onwards
richard
afterwards
richard
was
prince
of
wales
and
john
of
gaunt
was
duke
of
lancaster
so
cr
but
john
of
gaunt
used
the
feather
in
the
form
above
stated
and
to
find
a
duke
of
lancaster
john
of
gaunt
we
must
go
back
to
before
when
we
have
edward
iii
as
king
the
black
prince
as
prince
and
henry
of
lancaster
of
john
of
gaunt
as
duke
of
lancaster
he
derived
from
henry
and
like
the
mowbrays
had
no
blood
descent
from
philippa
of
hainault
a
curious
confirmation
of
my
suggestion
that
black
was
the
livery
colour
of
the
black
prince
is
found
in
the
fact
that
there
was
in
a
window
in
dunstan
church
london
within
a
wreath
of
roses
a
roundle

pale

azure

ostrich

the
words

and
the
letters
one
on
each
side
of
the
plume
this
was
intended
for
edward
doubtless
being
erected
in
the
reign
of
henry
viii
the
badge
in
the
form
in
which
we
know
it
enfiled
by
the
princely
coronet
dates
from
about
the
beginning
of
the
stuart
dynasty
since
when
it
appears
to
have
been
exclusively
reserved
for
the
eldest
son
and
to
the
throne
at
the
same
time
the
right
to
the
display
of
the
badge
would
appear
to
have
been
reserved
by
the
sovereign
and
woodward
remarks
on
the
privy
seals
of
our
sovereigns

ostrich

his
thomas
holand

use

perhaps
the
real
truth
is
that
the
earl
of
kent
having
the
better
claim
to
the
hind
richard
was
under
the
necessity
of
making
an
alteration
which
the
obvious
pun

his
name
suggested
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
crest

ireland
originated
therefrom

was
undoubtedly
lodged

i
have
been

interested
in

which
the
springing
attitude
has
developed

the
copying

that

that

heraldic
flags
banners
and
standards
when
it
comes
to
the
display
of
flags
the
individual
usually
makes
a
hash
of
the
whole
business
and
flies
either
the
personal
coat
of
arms
which
really
should
only
be
made
use
of
over
a
residence
of
the
sovereign
when
the
sovereign
is
actually
there
or
flown
at
sea
when
the
sovereign
is
on
board
or
else
he
uses
the
national
flag
colloquially
termed
the
union
jack
which
strictly
speaking
and
as
a
matter
of
law
ought
never
to
be
made
use
of
on
land
except
over
the
residence
of
the
sovereign
in
his
absence
or
on
a
fortress
or
other
government
building
but
recently
an
official
answer
has
been
given
in
parliament
declaring
what
is
presumably
the
pleasure
of
his
majesty
to
the
effect
that
the
union
jack
is
the
national
flag
and
may
be
flown
as
such
on
land
by
any
british
subject
if
this
is
the
intention
of
the
crown
it
is
a
pity
that
this
permission
has
not
been
embodied
in
a
royal
warrant
the
banner
of
george
which
is
a
white
flag
with
a
plain
red
cross
of
george
throughout
is
now
appropriated
to
the
order
of
the
garter
of
which
george
is
the
patron
saint
though
i
am
by
no
means
inclined
to
assert
that
it
would
be
incorrect
to
make
use
of
it
upon
a
church
which
happened
to
be
specifically
placed
under
the
patronage
of
george
the
white
ensign
which
is
a
white
flag
bearing
the
cross
of
george
and
in
the
upper
quarter
next
to
the
staff
a
reproduction
of
the
union
device
belongs
to
the
royal
navy
and
certain
privileged
individuals
to
whom
the
right
has
been
given
by
a
specific
warrant
the
blue
ensign
which
is
a
plain
blue
flag
with
the
union
device
on
a
canton
in
the
upper
corner
next
the
staff
belongs
to
the
royal
naval
reserve
and
the
red
ensign
which
is
the
same
as
the
former
except
that
a
red
flag
is
substituted
for
the
blue
one
belongs
to
the
ships
of
the
merchant
service
these
three
flags
have
been
specifically
called
into
being
by
specific
warrants
for
certain
purposes
which
are
stated
in
these
warrants
and
these
purposes
being
wholly
connected
with
the
sea
neither
the
blue
the
red
nor
the
white
ensign
ought
to
be
hoisted
on
land
by
anybody
of
course
there
is
no
penalty
for
doing
so
on
land
though
very
drastic
penalties
can
be
enforced
for
misuse
of
these
ensigns
on
the
water
a
step
which
is
taken
frequently
enough
for
a
private
person
to
use
any
one
of
these
three
flags
on
land
for
a
private
purpose
the
only
analogy
which
i
can
suggest
to
bring
home
to
people
the
absurdity
of
such
action
would
be
to
instance
a
private
person
for
his
own
private
pleasure
adopting
the
exact
uniform
of
some
regiment
whenever
he
might
feel
inclined
to
go
bathing
in
the
sea
if
he
were
to
do
so
he
would
find
under
the
recent
act
that
he
had
incurred
the
penalty
which
would
be
promptly
enforced
for
bringing
his
uniform
into
disrepute
it
is
much
to
be
wished
that
the
penalties
exacted
for
the
wrongful
display
of
these
flags
at
sea
should
be
extended
to
their
abuse
on
shore
the
development
of
the
union
jack
and
the
warrants
relating
to
it
are
dealt
with
herein
by
the
rev
crawford
in
a
subsequent
chapter
and
i
do
not
propose
to
further
deal
with
the
point
except
to
draw
attention
to
a
proposal
which
is
very
often
mooted
that
some
change
or
addition
to
the
union
jack
should
be
made
to
typify
the
inclusion
of
the
colonies
but
to
begin
with
what
is
the
union
jack
probably
most
would
be
inclined
to
answer
the
flag
of
the
empire
it
is
nothing
of
the
kind
it
is
in
a
way
stretching
the
definition
to
describe
it
as
the
king
flag
certainly
the
design
of
interlaced
crosses
is
a
badge
of
the
king
but
that
badge
is
of
a
later
origin
than
the
flag
the
flag
itself
is
the
fighting
emblem
of
the
sovereign
which
the
sovereign
has
declared
shall
be
used
by
his
soldiers
or
sailors
for
fighting
purposes
under
certain
specified
circumstances
that
it
is
used
even
officially
in
all
sorts
of
circumstances
with
which
the
warrants
are
not
concerned
is
beside
the
matter
for
it
is
to
the
royal
warrants
that
one
must
refer
for
the
theory
of
the
thing
now
let
us
go
further
back
and
trace
the
argent
a
cross
gules
the
part
which
is
england
contribution
to
the
union
jack
which
itself
is
a
combination
of
the
crosses
of
george
andrew
and
patrick
the
theory
of
one
is
the
theory
of
the
three
separately
or
conjoined
argent
a
cross
gules
was
never
the
coat
of
arms
of
england
except
under
the
commonwealth
when
its
use
for
armorial
purposes
may
certainly
be
disregarded
and
the
reason
it
came
to
be
regarded
as
the
flag
of
england
is
simply
and
solely
because
fighting
was
always
done
under
the
supposed
patronage
of
some
saint
and
england
fought
under
the
arms
of
england
but
under
the
flag
of
george
the
patron
saint
of
england
and
of
the
order
of
the
garter
the
george
for
merrie
england
is
too
well
known
to
need
more
than
the
passing
mention
scotland
fought
under
andrew
ireland
by
a
similar
analogy
had
for
its
patron
saint
patrick
if
indeed
there
was
a
cross
of
patrick
before
one
was
needed
for
the
union
flag
which
is
a
very
doubtful
point
and
the
union
jack
was
not
the
combination
of
three
territorial
flags
but
the
combination
of
the
recognised
emblems
of
the
three
recognised
saints
and
though
england
claimed
the
sovereignty
of
france
and
for
that
reason
quartered
the
arms
of
france
no
englishman
bothered
about
the
patronage
of
denis
and
the
emblem
of
denis
was
never
flown
in
this
country
the
fact
that
no
change
was
ever
made
in
the
flag
to
typify
hanover
whilst
hanover
duly
had
its
place
upon
the
arms
proves
that
the
flag
was
recognised
to
be
and
allowed
to
remain
the
emblem
of
the
three
patron
saints
under
whose
patronage
the
british
fought
and
not
the
badge
of
any
sovereignty
or
territorial
area
if
the
colonies
had
already
any
saint
of
their
own
under
whose
patronage
they
had
fought
in
bygone
days
or
in
whose
name
they
wished
to
fight
in
the
future
there
might
be
reason
including
the
emblem
of
that
upon
the
fighting
flag
of
the
empire
but
they
have
no
recognised
saintly
patrons
and
they
may
just
as
well
fight
for
our
saints
as
choose
others
for
themselves
at
so
late
a
day
but
having
a
flag
which
is
a
of
the
emblems
of
three
saints
and
which
contains
nothing
that
is
not
a
part
of
those
emblems
to
make
any
addition
heraldic
or
otherwise
to
it
now
would
in
my
opinion
be
best
expressed
by
the
following
illustration
imagine
three
soldiers
in
full
and
complete
uniform
one
english
one
scottish
and
one
irish
it
being
desired
to
evolve
a
uniform
that
should
be
taken
from
all
three
for
use
by
a
union
regiment
a
tunic
from
one
trousers
from
another
and
a
helmet
from
a
third
might
be
blended
into
a
very
effective
and
harmonious
composite
uniform
following
the
analogy
of
putting
a
bordure
which
is
not
the
emblem
of
a
saint
round
the
recognised
emblems
of
the
three
recognised
saints
and
considering
it
to
be
in
keeping
because
the
bordure
was
heraldic
and
the
emblems
heraldic
one
might
argue
that
because
a
uniform
was
clothing
as
was
also
a
skirt
therefore
a
skirt
outside
the
whole
would
be
in
keeping
with
the
rest
of
the
uniform
for
myself
i
should
dislike
any
addition
to
the
union
device
as
much
as
we
should
deride
the
donning
of
tulle
skirts
outside
their
tunics
and
trousers
by
the
brigade
of
guards
the
flag
which
should
float
from
a
church
tower
should
have
no
more
on
it
than
the
recognised
ecclesiastical
emblems
of
the
saint
to
whom
it
is
dedicated
the
keys
of
peter
the
wheel
of
catherine
the
sword
of
paul
the
cross
and
martlets
of
edmund
the
lily
of
mary
the
emblem
of
the
holy
trinity
or
whatever
the
emblem
may
be
of
the
saint
in
question
the
alternative
for
a
church
is
the
banner
of
george
the
patron
saint
of
the
realm
the
flags
upon
public
buildings
should
bear
the
arms
of
the
corporate
bodies
to
whom
those
buildings
belong
the
flag
to
be
flown
by
a
private
person
as
the
law
now
stands
should
bear
that
person
private
arms
if
he
has
any
and
if
he
has
not
he
should
be
content
to
forego
the
pleasures
arising
from
the
use
of
bunting
a
private
flag
should
be
double
its
height
in
length
the
entire
surface
should
be
occupied
by
the
coat
of
arms
these
flags
of
arms
are
and
it
is
quite
a
misnomer
to
term
the
banner

refers
to
the
long
tapering
flag
used
in
battle

under

an
overlord
mustered
his
retainers

did
display
his
armorial
bearings
next
to
the
staff

came
the
cross
of
george
which
was
depicted
of
course
on
a
white
field
this
occupied
rather
less
than
of
the
standard
the
remainder
of
the
standard
was
of
the
colour
or
colours
of
the
livery
and
thereupon
was
represented
all
sorts
of
devices
usually
the
badges
and
sometimes
the
crest
the
motto
was
usually
on
transverse
bands
which
frequently
divided
the
standard
into
compartments
for
the
different
badges
these
mottoes
from
their
nature
are
but
undoubtedly
relate
and
belong
to
the
badges
with
which
they
appear
in
conjunction
the
whole
banner
was
usually
fringed
with
the
livery
colours
giving
the
effect
of
a
bordure
compony
the
use
of
standards
does
not
seem
except
for
the
ceremonial
purposes

funerals
to
have
survived
the
tudor

doubtless
being
the
result
of
the
creation
of
the

exotic
standards
remaining
from

although
the

is
altered

largely
remains

xxxi
marks
of
cadency
the
manner
in
which
cadency
is
indicated
in
heraldic
emblazonment
forms
one
of
the
most
important
parts
of
british
armory
but
our
own
intricate
and
minutely
detailed
systems
are
a
purely
british
development
of
armory
i
do
not
intend
by
the
foregoing
remark
to
assert
that
the
occasional
use
or
even
as
in
some
cases
the
constant
use
of
altered
arms
for
purposes
of
indicating
cadency
is
unknown
on
the
continent
because
different
branches
of
one
family
are
constantly
found
using
for
the
purposes
of
distinction
variations
of
the
arms
appertaining
to
the
head
of
their
house
in
france
especially
the
bordure
has
been
extensively
used
but
the
fact
nevertheless
remains
that
in
no
other
countries
is
there
found
an
organised
system
or
set
of
rules
for
the
purpose
nor
is
this
idea
of
the
indication
of
cadency
wholly
a
modern
development
though
some
in
fact
most
of
the
rules
presently
in
force
are
no
doubt
a
result
of
modern
requirements
and
do
not
date
back
to
the
earliest
periods
of
heraldry
in
this
country
the
obligation
of
cadet
lines
to
difference
their
arms
was
recognised
practically
universally
in
the
fourteenth
century
and
when
later
the
systematic
use
of
differencing
seemed
in
danger
of
being
ignored
it
was
made
the
subject
of
specific
legislation
in
the
treatise
of
zypoeus
notitia
juris
lib
quoted
also
in
menetrier
du
we
find
the
following
ut

the
exception
is
curious
the
choice
of
these
as
marks
of
difference
are
often
termed
was
however
left
to
the
persons
concerned
and
there
is
consequently
a
great
variety
of
differences
or
differentiation
marks
which
seem
to
have
been
used
for
the
purpose
the
term
brisure
is
really
french
whilst
the
german
term
for
these
marks
is
beizeichen
british
heraldry
on
the
contrary
is
remarkable
for
its
use
of
two
distinct
sets
of
rules
the
english
and
the
scottish
the
irish
system
being
identical
with
the
former
to
understand
the
question
of
cadency
it
is
necessary
to
revert
to
the
status
of
a
coat
of
arms
in
early
periods
in
the
first
chapter
we
dealt
with
the
origin
of
armory
and
in
a
subsequent
chapter
with
the
status
of
a
coat
of
arms
in
great
britain
and
it
will
therefrom
have
been
apparent
that
arms
and
a
right
to
them
developed
in
this
country
as
an
adjunct
of
or
contemporaneously
with
the
extension
of
the
feudal
system
every
landowner
was
at
one
time
required
to
have
his
seal
presumably
of
arms
and
as
a
result
arms
were
naturally
then
considered
to
possess
something
of
a
territorial
character
i
do
not
by
this
mean
to
say
that
the
arms
belonged
to
the
land
and
were
transferable
with
the
sale
and
purchase
thereof
there
never
was
in
this
country
a
period
at
which
such
an
idea
held
nor
were
arms
originally
entirely
personal
or
individual
they
belonged
rather
to
a
position
between
the
two
they
were
the
arms
of
a
given
family
originating
because
that
family
held
land
and
accepted
the
consequent
responsibilities
thereto
belonging
but
the
arms
appertained
for
the
time
being
to
the
member
of
that
family
who
owned
the
land
and
that
this
is
the
true
idea
of
the
former
status
of
a
coat
of
arms
is
perhaps
best
evidenced
by
the
grey
and
hastings
controversy
which
engaged
the
attention
of
the
court
of
chivalry
for
several
years
prior
to
the
decision
and
judgment
in
the
case
gave
the
undifferenced
arms
of
hastings
to
the
grey
de
ruthyn
the
sir
edward
hastings
being
found
only
capable
of
bearing
the
arms
of
hastings
subject
to
some
mark
of
difference
this
case
and
the
case
of
scrope
and
grosvenor
in
which
the
king
award
was
that
the
bordure
was
not
sufficient
difference
for
a
stranger
in
blood
being
only
the
mark
of
a
cadet
show
clearly
that
the
status
of
a
coat
of
arms
in
early
times
was
that
in
its
undifferenced
state
it
belonged
to
one
person
only
for
the
time
being
and
that
person
the
head
of
the
family
though
it
should
be
noted
that
the
term
head
of
the
family
seems
to
have
been
interpreted
into
the
one
who
held
the
lands
of
the
family
whether
he
were
or
being
apparently
immaterial
this
much
being
recognised
it
follows
that
some
means
were
needed
to
be
devised
to
differentiate
the
armorial
bearings
of
the
younger
members
of
the
family
of
course
the
earliest
definite
instances
of
any
attempt
at
a
systematic
differencing
for
cadency
which
can
be
referred
to
are
undoubtedly
those
cases
presented
by
the
arms
of
the
younger
members
of
the
royal
family
in
england
these
cases
however
it
is
impossible
to
take
as
precedents
royal
arms
have
always
from
the
very
earliest
times
been
a
law
unto
themselves
subject
only
to
the
will
of
the
sovereign
and
it
is
neither
safe
nor
correct
to
deduce
precedents
to
be
applied
to
the
arms
of
subjects
from
proved
instances
concerning
the
royal
arms
probably
apart
from
these
the
earliest
mark
of
cadency
which
is
to
be
met
with
in
heraldry
is
the
label
fig
used
to
indicate
the
eldest
son
and
this
mark
of
difference
dates
back
far
beyond
any
other
regularised
methods
applicable
to
younger
sons
the
german
name
for
the
label
is
turnierkragen
tournament
collar
which
may
indicate
the
origin
of
this
curious
figure
probably
the
use
of
the
label
can
be
taken
back
to
the
middle
or
early
part
of
the
thirteenth
century
but
the
opportunity
and
necessity
of
marking
the
arms
of
the
temporarily
he
having
the
expectation
of
eventually
succeeding
to
the
undifferenced
arms
is
a
very
different
matter
to
the
other
opportunities
for
the
use
of
marks
of
cadency
the
lord
and
his
heir
were
the
two
most
important
members
of
the
family
and
all
others
sunk
their
identity
in
their
position
in
the
household
of
their
chief
unless
they
were
established
by
marriage
or
otherwise
in
lordships
of
their
own
in
which
cases
they
are
usually
found
to
have
preferred
the
arms
of
the
family
from
whom
they
inherited
the
lordships
they
enjoyed
and
their
identities
being
to
such
a
large
extent
overlooked
the
necessity
for
any
system
of
marking
the
arms
of
a
younger
son
was
not
so
early
apparent
as
the
necessity
for
marking
the
arms
of
the
heir
illustration
fig
the
label
the
label
does
not
appear
to
have
been
originally
confined
exclusively
to
the
heir
it
was
at
first
the
only
method
of
differencing
known
and
it
is
not
therefore
to
be
wondered
at
that
we
find
that
it
was
frequently
used
by
other
cadets
who
used
it
with
no
other
meaning
than
to
indicate
that
they
were
not
the
head
of
the
house
it
has
consequently
in
some
few
cases
for
example
in
the
arms
of
courtenay
fig
babington
and
barrington
become
stereotyped
as
a
charge
and
is
continuously
and
unchangeably
used
as
such
whereas
doubtless
it
may
have
been
no
more
originally
than
a
mere
mark
of
cadency
the
label
was
originally
drawn
with
its
upper
edge
identical
with
the
top
of
the
shield
fig
but
later
its
position
on
the
shield
was
lowered
the
number
of
points
on
the
label
was
at
first
without
meaning
a
label
occurring
in
fig
and
a
one
in
fig
in
the
roll
of
caerlaverock
the
label
is
repeatedly
referred

said
to
bear
his

his
younger
brother
nicholas
carries
them
with
a
label
gules
and
in
the
case
of
edmund
de
hastings
the
label
is
also
assigned
to
a
younger
brother
further
proof
of
its
being
thus
borne
by
cadets
is
furnished
by
the
evidence
in
the
grey
and
hastings
controversy
in
the
reign
of
henry
from
which
it
appeared
that
the
younger
line
of
the
hastings
family
had
for
generations
differenced
the
paternal
coat
by
a
label
of
three
points
and
as
various
knights
and
esquires
had
deposed
to
this
label
being
the
cognisance
of
the
nearest
heir
it
was
argued
that
the
defendant
ancestors
would
not
have
borne
their
arms
in
this
way
had
they
not
been
the
reputed
next
heirs
of

will
be
seen
in

though
its
occurrence
in

most
unusual
the

next
to
the
use
of
the
label
in
british
heraldry
came
the
use
of
the
bordure
and
the
latter
as
a
mark
of
cadency
can
at
any
rate
be
traced
back
a
matter
of
and
precedent
as
far
as
the
scrope
and
grosvenor
controversy
in
the
closing
years
of
the
fourteenth
century
at
the
period
when
the
bordure
as
a
difference
is
to
be
most
frequently
met
with
in
english
heraldry
it
never
had
any
more
definite
status
or
meaning
than
a
sign
that
the
bearer
was
the
head
of
the
house
though
one
can
not
but
think
that
in
many
cases
in
which
it
occurs
its
significance
is
a
doubt
as
to
legitimate
descent
or
a
doubt
of
the
probability
of
an
asserted
descent
in
modern
practice
the
bordure
as
a
difference
for
cadets
only
continues
to
be
used
by
those
whose
ancestors
bore
it
in
ancient
times
its
other
use
as
a
modern
mark
of
illegitimacy
is
dealt
with
in
the
chapter
upon
marks
of
illegitimacy
but
the
curious
and
unique
system
of
cadency
bordures
will
be
presently
referred
to
in
germany
of
old
the
use
of
the
bordure
as
a
difference
does
not
appear
to
have
been
very
frequent
but
it
is
now
used
to
distinguish
the
arms
of
the
crown
prince
in
italian
heraldry
although
differences
are
known
there
is
no
system
whatever
in
spain
and
portugal
marks
of
cadency
in
our
sense
of
the
word
are
almost
unknown
but
nevertheless
the
bordure
especially
as
indicating
descent
from
a
maternal
ancestor
is
very
largely
employed
the
most
familiar
instance
is
afforded
by
the
royal
arms
of
portugal
in
which
the
arms
of
portugal
are
surrounded
by
a
bordure
of
castile
differencing
however
had
become
a
necessity
at
an
earlier
period
than
the
period
at
which
we
find
an
approach
to
the
systematic
usage
of
the
label
bordure
and
bend
but
it
should
be
noticed
that
those
who
wished
and
needed
to
difference
were
those
younger
members
of
the
family
who
by
settlement
or
marriage
had
themselves
become
lords
of
other
estates
and
heads
of
distinct
houses
for
a
man
must
be
taken
as
a
head
of
a
house
for
all
intents
and
purposes
as
soon
as
by
his
possession
of
lands
held
in
chief
he
became
liable
to
the
crown
to
provide
stated
military
service
and
as
a
consequence
found
the
necessity
for
a
banner
of
arms
under
which
his
men
could
be
mustered
now
having
these
positions
as
overlords
the
inducement
was
rather
to
set
up
arms
for
themselves
than
to
pose
merely
as
cadets
of
other
families
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
whatever
that
at
the
earliest
period
differencing
for
the
above
reason
took
the
form
of
and
was
meant
as
a
in
the
it
was
something
quite
beyond
and
apart
from
the
mere
condition
of
a
right
to
recognised
arms
with
an
indication
thereupon
that
the
bearer
was
not
the
person
chiefly
entitled
to
the
display
of
that
particular
coat
we
therefore
find
cadets
bearing
the
arms
of
their
house
with
the
tincture
changed
with
subsidiary
charges
introduced
or
with
some
similar
radical
alteration
made
such
coats
should
properly
be
considered
essentially
coats
merely
in
their
design
a
given
relationship
rather
than
as
the
coat
regularly
differenced
by
rule
to
indicate
cadency

instance
the
three
original
branches
of
the
conyers

or

the
coat
differenced
by
the
bend
of
course
stands
as
a
differenced
coat
but
it
is
by
no
means
certain
nor
is
it
known
whether
azure
a
maunch
ermine
or
azure
a
maunch
or
indicates
the
original
conyers
arms
for
the
very
simple
reason
that
it
is
now
impossible
to
definitely
prove
which
branch
supplies
the
true
head
of
the
family
it
is
known
that
a
wicked
uncle
intervened
and
usurped
the
estates
to
the
detriment
of
the
nephew
and
heir
but
whether
the
uncle
usurped
the
arms
with
the
estates
or
whether
the
heir
changed
his
arms
when
settled
on
the
other
lands
to
which
he
migrated
there
is
now
no
means
of
ascertaining
similarly
we
find
the
darcy
arms
argent
three
cinquefoils
gules
which
is
probably
the
oldest
form
argent
crusuly
and
three
cinquefoils
gules
and
azure
crusuly
and
three
cinquefoils
argent
and
countless
instances
can
be
referred
to
where
for
the
purpose
of
indicating
cadency
the
arms
of
a
family
were
changed
in
this
manner
this
reason
of
which
there
can
be
no
doubt
supplies
the
origin
and
the
excuse
for
the
custom
of
assigning
arms
when
the
descent
is
but
doubtful
similarity
originally
though
it
indicate
consanguinity
was
never
intended
to
be
proof
thereof
the
principal
ancient
methods
of
alteration
in
arms
which
nowadays
are
apparently
accepted
as
former
modes
of
differencing
merely
to
indicate
cadency
may
perhaps
be
classified
into
change
of
tincture
the
addition
of
small
charges
to
the
field
or
to
an
ordinary
the
addition
of
a
label
or
of
a
canton
or
quarter
the
addition
of
an
inescutcheon
the
addition
or
change
of
an
ordinary
the
changing
of
the
lines
of
partition
enclosing
an
ordinary
and
perhaps
also
diminishing
the
number
of
charges
a
change
of
some
or
all
of
the
minor
charges
at
a
later
date
came
the
systematic
use
of
the
label
the
bordure
and
the
bend
and
subsequently
the
use
of
the
modern
systems
of
marks
of
cadency
perhaps
also
one
should
include
the
addition
of
quarterings
the
use
of
augmentations
and
official
arms
and
the
escutcheon
indicating
a
territorial
and
titular
lordship
but
the
three
though
useful
for
distinction
and
frequently
obviating
the
necessity
of
other
marks
of
cadency
did
not
originate
with
the
theory
or
necessities
of
differencing
and
are
not
properly
marks
of
cadency
at
the
same
time
the
warning
should
be
given
that
it
is
not
safe
always
to
presume
cadency
when
a
change
of
tincture
or
other
slight
deviation
from
an
earlier
form
of
the
arms
is
met
with
many
families
when
they
exhibited
their
arms
at
the
visitations
could
not
substantiate
them
and
the
heralds
in
confirming
arms
frequently
deliberately
changed
the
tinctures
of
many
coats
they
met
with
to
introduce
distinction
from
other
authorised
arms
practically
contemporarily
with
the
use
of
the
bordure
came
the
use
of
the
bend
then
employed
for
the
same
purpose
in
the
de
one
of
the
earliest
armorials
now
in
existence
which
can
be
referred
to
the
coat
of
abernethy
is
there
differenced
by
the
bendlet
engrailed
and
the
arms
of
the
king
of
navarre
bear
his
quartering
of
france
differenced
by
a
bendlet
compony
amongst
other
instances
in
which
the
bend
or
bendlet
appears
originally
as
a
mark
of
cadency
but
now
as
a
charge
may
be
mentioned
the
arms
of
fitzherbert
fulton
stewart
earl
of
galloway
and
others
it
is
a
safe
presumption
with
regard
to
ancient
coats
of
arms
that
any
coat
in
which
the
field
is
semé
is
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
a
differenced
coat
for
a
junior
cadet
as
is
also
any
coat
in
which
a
charge
or
ordinary
is
debruised
by
another
of
course
in
more
modern
times
no
such
presumption
is
permissible
an
instance
of
a
semé
field
for
cadency
will
be
found
in
the
case
of
the
arms
already
mentioned
little
would
be
gained
by
a
long
list
of
instances
of
such
differences
because
the
most
careful
and
systematic
investigations
clearly
show
that
in
early
times
no
definite
rules
whatever
existed
as
to
the
assumption
of
differences
which
largely
depended
upon
the
pleasure
of
the
bearer
and
no
system
can
be
deduced
which
can
be
used
to
decide
that
the
appearance
of
any
given
difference
or
kind
of
difference
meant
a
given
set
of
circumstances
nor
can
any
system
be
deduced
which
has
any
value
for
the
purposes
of
precedent
certain
instances
are
appended
which
will
indicate
the
style
of
differencing
which
was
in
vogue
but
it
should
be
distinctly
remembered
that
the
object
was
not
to
allocate
the
bearer
of
any
particular
coat
of
arms
to
any
specific
place
in
the
family
pedigree
but
merely
to
show
that
he
was
not
the
head
of
the
house
entitled
to
bear
the
undifferenced
arms
if
indeed
it
would
not
be
more
accurate
to
describe
these
instances
as
simply
examples
of
different
coats
of
arms
used
by
members
of
the
same
family
for
it
should
be
remembered
that
anciently
before
the
days
of
black
and
white
illustration
prominent
change
of
tincture
was
admittedly
a
sufficient
distinction
between
strangers
in
blood
beyond
the
use
of
the
label
and
the
bordure
there
does
not
seem
to
have
been
any
recognised
system
of
differencing
until
at
the
earliest
the
fifteenth
century
probably
any
regulated
system
does
not
date
much
beyond
the
commencement
of
the
series
of
visitations
of
the
four
sons
of
gilles
de
mailly
who
bore
or
three
mallets
vert
the
second
third
and
fourth
sons
respectively
made
the
charges
gules
azure
and
sable
the
argent
field
of
the
douglas
coat
was
in
some
branches
converted
into
ermine
as
early
as
and
the
descendants
of
the
douglases
of
dalkeith
made
the
chief
gules
instead
of
azure
a
similar
mode
of
differencing
occurs
in
the
lyon
register
in
many
other
families
the
murrays
of
culbin
in
the
north
bore
a
sable
field
for
their
arms
in
lieu
of
the
more
usual
azure
and
there
seems
reason
to
believe
that
the
southern
frasers
originally
bore
their
field
sable
the
change
to
azure
being
an
alteration
made
by
those
branches
who
migrated
northwards

that

there
is
no
rule
as
to
its
colour

is
left
to
the
pleasure
of
the
bearer

it
is
usually
decided
as
follows
that
it
shall
not
be
metal
on
metal
or
colour
on
colour
that
it
shall
not

from
any

in
which
any
component
part
of
the

is
depicted
though
anciently
the
label
was
drawn
throughout
the
shield
this
does
not
now
seem
to
be
a
method
officially
adopted
at
any
rate
drawn
throughout
it
apparently
obtains
no
official
countenance
for
the
arms

subjects
though
many
of

best
heraldic
artists
always
so
depict
it
the
eldest

his
father
lifetime
succeeding
to
the
undifferenced

the
death

the
grandchildren
of
the
then
head
of

difference
upon
the

but
such
difference
marks
are
like
their
father
only
contemporary
with
the
life
of
the
grandfather
and
immediately
upon
the
succession
of
their
father
the
children
remove
the
label
and
difference
upon
the
original
arms
the
use
of
arms
by
a
junior
grandson
is
so
restricted
in
ordinary
life
that
to
all
intents
and
purposes
this
may
be
ignored
except
in
the
case
of
the
of
the
of
the
grandson
in
the
lifetimes
of
his
father
and
grandfather
in
his
case
one
label
of
points
is
used
and
to
place
a
label
upon
a
label
is
not
correct
when
both
are
marks
of
cadency
and
not
charges
but
the
grandson
on
the
death
of
his
father
during
the
lifetime
of
the
grandfather
and
when
the
grandson
succeeds
as
of
the
grandfather
succeeds
also
to
the
label
of
three
points
which
may
therefore
more
properly
be
described
as
the
difference
mark
of
the
than
the
difference
mark
of
the
eldest
son
it
is
necessary
perhaps
having
said
this
to
add
the
remark
that
heraldry
knows
no
such
thing
as
disinheritance
and
heirship
is
an
inalienable
matter
of
blood
descent
and
not
of
worldly
inheritance
no
woman
can
ever
be
an
though
now
the
number
of
points
on
a
label
is
a
matter
of
rule
this
is
far
from
having
been
always
the
case
and
prior
to
the
stuart
period
no
deductions
can
be
drawn
with
certainty
from
the
number
of
the
points
in
use
it
seems
a
very
great
pity
that
no
warrants
were
issued
for
the
children
of
the
then
duke
of
york
during
the
lifetime
of
queen
victoria
as
labels
for
would
have
been
quite
unique
if
the
eldest
son
succeeds
through
the
death
of
his
mother
to
her
arms
and
quarterings
during
his
father
lifetime
he
must
be
careful
that
the
label
which
he
bears
as
to
his
father
arms
does
not
cross
the
quartering
of
his
mother
arms
if
his
father
bears
a
quarterly
shield
the
label
is
so
placed
that
it
shall
apparently
debruise
all
his
father
quarterings
in
a
shield
quarterly
of
four
the
label
would
be
placed
in
the
centre
chief
point
the
centre
file
of
the
label
being
upon
the
palar
line
and
the
other
files
in
the
first
and
second
quarters
respectively
whilst
the
colour
would
usually
depend
as
has
been
above
indicated
upon
the
tinctures
of
the
pronominal
arms
due
regard
however
must
be
had
that
a
label
of
gules
for
example
is
not
placed
on
a
field
of
gules
a
label
is
not
nowadays
permissible
though
instances
of
its
use
can
occasionally
be
met
with
in
early
examples
supposing
the
field
of
the
first
quarter
is
argent
and
that
of
the
second
azure
in
all
probability
the
best
colour
for
the
label
would
be
gules
and
indeed
gules
is
the
colour
most
frequently
met
with
for

the
position
for
a
mark
of
difference
is
in
the
centre
chief
point
though
it
is
not
incorrect
and
many
such
instances
will
be
found
for
it
to
be
charged
on
a
chevron
or
fess
in
the

point
this
however
is
not
a
very
desirable

so
on
and
there
is
an
instance
in
the
visitation
of
london
in
which
the
arms
of
cokayne
appear
with
crescents
one
upon
another
this
instance
has
been
already
referred
to
on
page
of
course
when
the
english
system
is
carried
to
these
lengths
it
becomes
absurd
because
the
crescents
charged
one
upon
each
other
become
so
small
as
to
be
practically
indistinguishable
there
are
however
very
few
cases
in
which
such
a
display
would
be
correct
as
will
be
presently
explained
this
difficulty
which
looms
large
in
theory
amounts
to
very
little
in
the
practical
use
of
armory
but
it
nevertheless
is
the
one
outstanding
objection
to
the
english
system
of
difference
marks
it
is
constantly
held
up
to
derision
by
those
people
who
are
unaware
of
the
next
rule
upon
the
subject
which
is
that
as
soon
as
a
quartering
comes
into
the
possession
of
a
cadet
branch
which
quartering
is
not
enjoyed
by
the
head
of
the
house
all
necessity
for
any
marks
of
difference
at
all
is
considered
to
be
ended
provided
that
that
quartering
is
always
displayed
and
that
cadet
branch
then
begins
afresh
from
that
generation
to
redifference
now
there
are
few
english
families
in
whose
pedigree
during
three
or
four
generations
one
marriage
is
not
with
an
heiress
in
blood
so
that
this
theoretical
difficulty
very
quickly
disappears
no
doubt
there
is
always
an
inducement
to
retain
the
quarterings
of
an
historical
or
illustrious
house
which
may
have
been
brought
in
in
the
past
but
if
the
honours
and
lands
brought
in
with
that
quartering
are
wholly
enjoyed
by
the
head
of
the
house
it
becomes
from
a
practical
point
of
view
mere
affectation
to
prefer
that
quartering
to
another
brought
in
subsequently
of
a
family
the
entire
representation
of
which
belongs
to
the
junior
branch
and
not
to
the
senior
if
the
old
idea
of
confining
a
shield
to
four
quarters
be
borne
in
mind
concurrently
with
the
necessity
for
purposes
of
distinction
of
introducing
new
quarterings
the
new
quarterings
take
the
place
of
the
old
the
use
of
which
is
left
to
the
senior
branch
under
such
circumstances
and
the
regular
practice
of
them
the
english
system
is
seldom
wanting
and
it
at
once
wipes
out
the
difficulty
which
is
made
much
of
that
under
the
english
system
there
is
no
way
of
indicating
the
difference
between
the
arms
of
uncle
and
nephew
if
the
use
of
impalements
is
also
adhered
to
the
difficulty
practically
vanishes
to
difference
a
coat
the
mark
of
difference
is
placed
in
the
centre
chief
point
to
difference
a
coat
of
four
quarters
the
same
position
on
the
shield
is
most
generally
used
the
mark
being
placed
over
the
palar
line
though
occasionally
the
difference
mark
is
placed
and
not
incorrectly
in
the
centre
of
the
quarterings
a
coat
of
six
quarters
however
is
always
differenced
on
the
fess
line
of
partition
the
mark
being
placed
in
the
fess
point
because
if
placed
in
the
centre
chief
point
it
would
only
appear
as
a
difference
upon
the
second
quartering
so
that
on
all
shields
of
six
or
more
quarterings
the
difference
mark
must
be
placed
on
some
line
of
partition
at
the
nearest
possible
point
to
the
true
centre
fess
point
of
the
escutcheon
it
is
then
understood
to
difference
the
whole
of
the
quarterings
over
which
it
is
displayed
but
directly
a
quartering
is
introduced
which
has
been
inherited
subsequently
to
the
cadency
which
produced
the
difference
mark
that
difference
mark
must
be
either
discarded
or
transferred
to
the
first
quartering
only
use
of
these
difference
marks
is
neither
officially
nor
unofficially
is
any
attempt
made
to
enforce
their
use
in
england
they
are
left
to
the
pleasure
and
discretion
of
the
bearers
though
it
is
a
and
position
that
unless
differenced
by
quarterings
or
impalement
it
is
neither
courteous
nor
proper
for
a
cadet
to
display
the
arms
of
the
head
of
his
house
beyond
this
the
matter
is
usually
left
to
good
taste
there
is
however
one
position
in
which
the
use
of
difference
marks
is
compulsory
if
under
a
royal
licence
or
other
exemplification
for
instance
the
creation
of
a
peerage
a
difference
mark
is
painted
upon
the
arms
or
even
if
an
exemplification
of
the
arms
differenced
is
placed
at
the
head
of
an
official
record
of
pedigree
those
arms
would
not
subsequently
be
exemplified
or
their
use
officially
admitted
without
the
difference
mark
that
has
been
recorded
with
them
the
differencing
of
crests
for
cadency
is
very
rare
theoretically
these
should
be
marked
equally
with
the
shield

it
is
rare
indeed
to

more

a

the

obviates
the
slightest
necessity
for
any
further

to

his

succeeded

way
usually
in

colour
of

the
fact
that
there
are
illegitimate

does
not
prevent
the
descendants
of
any
daughter
quartering
the

exemplified

is
concerned
she
is

the
method
of
differencing
the
english
royal
arms
is
quite
unique
and
has
no
relation
to
the
method
ordinarily
in
use
in
this
country
for
the
arms
of
subjects
the
royal
arms
are
not
personal
they
are
the
sovereign
arms
of
dominion
indicating
the
sovereignty
enjoyed
by
the
person
upon
the
throne
consequently
they
are
in
no
degree
hereditary
and
from
the
earliest
times
certainly
since
the
reign
of
edward
the
right
to
bear
the
undifferenced
arms
has
been
confined
exclusively
to
the
sovereign
upon
the
throne
in
early
times
there
were
two
methods
employed
namely
the
use
of
the
bordure
and
of
varieties
of
the
label
the
label
of
the
to
the
english
throne
being
originally
of
azure
the
arms
of
thomas
of
woodstock
the
youngest
son
of
edward
were
differenced
by
a
bordure
argent
his
elder
brother
thomas
de
brotherton
having
had
a
label
of
three
points
argent
whilst
the
eldest
son
edward
as
prince
of
wales
used
a
label
of
three
points
azure
from
that
period
to
the
end
of
the
tudor
period
the
use
of
labels
and
bordures
seems
to
have
continued
concurrently
some
members
of
the
royal
family
using
one
some
the
other
though
there
does
not
appear
to
have
been
any
precise
rules
governing
a
choice
between
the
two
when
edward
iii
claimed
the
throne
of
france
and
quartered
the
arms
of
that
country
with
those
of
england
of
course
a
portion
of
the
field
then
became
azure
and
a
blue
label
upon
a
blue
field
was
no
longer
possible
the
therefore
differenced
his
shield
by
the
plain
label
of
three

and
this
has
ever
since
down
to
the
present
day
continued
to
be
the
difference
used
by
the
to
the
english
throne
a
label
of
gules
upon
the
gules
quartering
of
england
was
equally
impossible
and
consequently
from
that
period
all
labels
used
by
any
member
of
the
royal
family
have
been
argent
charged
with
different
objects
these
being
frequently

about

cases

this

abroad
there
is
now
no
equivalent
whatever
to
our
methods
of
differencing
the
royal
arms
an
official
certificate
was
issued
to
me
recently
from
denmark
of
the
undifferenced
royal
arms
of
denmark
certified
as
correct
for
the
princes
and
princesses
of
that
country
but
the
german
crown
prince
bears
his
shield
within
a
bordure
gules
and
anciently
in
france
from
which
country
the
english
system
was
very
probably
originally
derived
the
differencing
of
the
royal
french
arms
for
the
younger
branches
seems
to
have
been
carefully
attended
to
as
has
been
already
specified
differencing
in
scotland
is
carried
out
on
an
entirely
different
basis
from
differencing
in
england
in
scotland
the
idea
is
still
rigidly
preserved
and
adhered
to
that
the
coat
of
arms
of
a
family
belongs
only
to
the
head
of
the
family
for
the
time
being
and
the
terms
of
a
scottish
grant
are
as
follows
know
ye
therefore
that
we
have
devised
and
do
by
these
presents
assign
ratify
and
confirm
to
the
said
and
his
descendants
such
congruent
differences
as
may
hereafter
be
matriculated
for
them
the
following
ensigns
under
the
accepted
interpretation
of
scottish
armorial
law
whilst
the
inherent
gentility
conferred
by
a
patent
of
arms
is
not
denied
to
cadets
no
right
to
make
use
of
arms
is
conceded
to
them
until
such
time
as
they
shall
elect
to
matriculate
the
arms
of
their
ancestor
in
their
own
names
this
point
has
led
to
a
much
purer
system
of
heraldry
in
scotland
than
in
england
and
there
is
far
less
heraldic
abuse
in
that
country
as
a
result
because
the
differences
are
decided
not
haphazardly
by
the
user
himself
as
is
the
case
in
england
but
by
a
competent
officer
of
arms
moreover
the
constant
occasions
of
matriculation
bring
the
arms
frequently
under
official
review
there
is
no
fixed
rule
which
decides
what
difference
shall
be
borne
and
consequently
this
decision
has
retained
in
the
hands
of
the
heraldic
executive
an
amount
of
control
which
they
still
possess
far
exceeding
that
of
the
executive
in
england
and
perhaps
the
best
way
in
which
to
state
the
rules
which
hold
good
will
be
to
reprint
a
portion
of
one
of
the
rhind
lectures
delivered
by
sir
james
balfour
paul
which
is
devoted
to
the
point
i
have
said
that
in
scotland
the
principle
which
limited
the
number
of
paternal
coats
led
to
a
careful
differencing
of
these
coats
as
borne
by
the
junior
branches
of
the
family
though
the
english
system
was
sometimes
used
it
has
never
obtained
to
any
great
extent
in
scotland
the
practice
here
being
generally
to
difference
by
means
of
a
bordure
in
which
way
many
more
generations
are
capable
of
being
distinguished
than
is
possible
by
the
english
method
the
weak
point
of
the
scottish
system
is
that
whilst
the
general
idea
is
good
there
is
no
definite
rule
whereby
it
can
be
carried
out
on
unchanging
lines
much
is
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
authorities
as
a
general
rule
it
may
be
stated
that
the
second
son
bears
a
plain
bordure
of
the
tincture
of
the
principal
charge
in
the
shield
and
his
younger
brothers
also
bear
plain
bordures
of
varying
tinctures
in
the
next
generation
the
eldest
son
of
the
second
son
would
bear
his
father
coat
and
bordure
without
change
the
second
son
would
have
the
bordure
engrailed
the
third
invected
the
fourth
indented
and
so
on
the
other
sons
of
the
younger
sons
in
this
generation
differencing
their
father
bordures
in
the
same
way
the
junior
members
of
the
next
generation
might
have
their
bordures
parted
per
pale
the
following
generations
having
their
bordures
parted
per
fess
and
per
saltire
per
cross
or
quarterly
gyronny
or
compony
that
is
divided
into
alternate
spaces
of
metal
or
colour
in
a
single
trace
this
however
being
often
in
scotland
a
mark
of
illegitimacy
or
a
similar
pattern
in
two
tracts
or
chequy
with
three
or
more
tracts
you
will
see
that
these
modifications
of
the
simple
bordure
afford
a
great
variety
of
differences
and
when
they
are
exhausted
the
expedient
can
then
be
resorted
to
of
placing
on
the
bordures
charges
taken
from
other
coats
often
from
those
of
a
maternal
ancestor
or
they
may
be
arbitrarily
assigned
to
denote
some
personal
characteristic
of
the
bearer
as
in
the
case
of
james
maitland
major
in
the
scots
regiment
of
foot
guards
who
carries
the
dismembered
lion
of
his
family
within
a
bordure
wavy
azure
charged
with
eight
hand
grenades
or
significant
i
presume
of
his
military
profession
you
will
observe
that
with
all
these
varieties
of
differencing
we
have
mentioned
the
younger
branches
descending
from
the
original
eldest
son
of
the
parent
house
are
still
left
unprovided
with
marks
of
cadency
these
however
can
be
arranged
for
by
taking
the
ordinary
which
appears
in
their
father
arms
and
modifying
its
boundary
lines
say
the
original
coat
was
a
chevron
gules
the
second
son
of
the
eldest
son
would
have
the
chevron
engrailed
but
without
any
bordure
the
third
invected
and
so
on
and
the
next
generations
the
systems
of
bordures
accompanying
the
modified
chevron
would
go
on
as
before
and
when
all
these
methods
are
exhausted
differences
can
still
be
made
in
a
variety
of
ways
by
charging
the
ordinary
with
similar
charges
in
a
similar
manner
to
the
bordure
as
erskine
of
shielfield
a
cadet
of
balgownie
who
bore
on
a
pale
sable
a
cross
crosslet
fitchée
or
within
a
bordure
azure
or
by
the
introduction
of
an
ordinary
into
a
coat
which
had
not
one
previously
a
bend
or
the
ribbon
which
is
a
small
bend
being
a
favourite
ordinary
to
use
for
this
purpose
again
we
occasionally
find
a
change
of
tincture
of
the
field
of
the
shield
used
to
denote
cadency
there
are
other
modes
of
differencing
which
need
not
be
alluded
to
in
detail
but
i
may
say
that
on
analysing
the
earlier
arms
in
the
lyon
register
i
find
that
the
bordure
is
by
far
the
most
common
method
of
indicating
cadency
being
used
in
no
less
than
cases
the
next
most
popular
way
is
by
changing
the
boundary
lines
of
an
ordinary
which
is
done
in
shields
cadets
difference
their
arms
by
the
insertion
of
a
smaller
charge
on
the
ordinary
and
on
the
shield
a
change
of
tincture
including
counterchanging
is
carried
out
in
coats
and
a
canton
is
added
in
cases
while
there
are
coats
in
which
two
or
more
of
the
above
methods
are
used
from
these
figures
which
are
approximately
correct
you
will
see
the
relative
frequency
of
the
various
modes
of
differencing
you
will
also
note
that
the
original
coat
of
a
family
can
be
differenced
in
a
great
many
ways
so
as
to
show
the
connection
of
cadets
with
the
parent
house
the
drawback
to
the
system
is
that
heralds
have
never
arrived
at
a
uniform
treatment
so
as
to
render
it
possible
to
calculate
the
exact
relationship
of
the
cadets
much
is
left
as
i
said
to
the
discretion
of
the
officer
granting
the
arms
but
still
it
gives
considerable
assistance
in
determining
the
descent
of
a
family
the
late
stodart
lyon
clerk
depute
who
was
an
able
herald
particularly
in
matters
relating
to
scotland
had
elaborated
a
definite
system
of
these
bordures
for
differencing
which
would
have
done
much
to
simplify
scottish
cadency
its
weak
point
was
obviously
this
that
it
could
only
be
applied
to
new
matriculations
of
arms
by
cadets
and
so
if
adopted
as
a
definite
and
unchangeable
matter
of
rule
it
might
have
occasioned
doubt
and
misunderstanding
in
future
times
with
regard
to
many
important
scottish
coats
now
existing
without
reference
to
stodart
system
but
the
scheme
elaborated
by
stodart
is
now
accepted
as
the
broad
basis
of
the
scottish
system
for
matriculations
fig
in
early
scottish
seals
the
bordures
are
to
so
large
an
extent
engrailed
as
to
make
it
appear
that
the
later
and
present
rule
which
gives
the
plain
bordure
to
immediate
cadets
was
not
fully
recognised
or
adopted
bordures
charged
appear
at
a
comparatively
early
date
in
scotland
the
bordure
compony
in
scotland
and
the
bordure
wavy
in
england
which
are
now
used
to
signify
illegitimacy
will
be
further
considered
in
a
subsequent
chapter
but
neither
one
nor
the
other
originally
carried
any
such
meaning
the
doubtful
legitimacy
of
the
avondale
and
ochiltree
stewarts
who
bore
the
bordure
compony
in
scotland
along
with
its
use
by
the
beauforts
in
england
has
tended
latterly
to
bring
that
difference
into
disrepute
in
the
cadency
of
lawful
sons
yet
some
of
the
bearers
of
that
bordure
during
the
first
twenty
years
of
the
lyon
register
were
unquestionably
legitimate
whilst
others
as
scott
of
gorrenberry
and
patrick
sinclair
of
ulbester
were
illegitimate
or
at
best
only
legitimated
the
light
in
which
the
bordure
compony
had
come
to
be
regarded
is
shown
by
a
royal
warrant
granted
in
to
john
lundin
of
that
ilk
allowing
him
to
drop
the
coat
which
his
family
had
hitherto
carried
and
as
descended
of
a
natural
son
of
william
the
lion
to
bear
the
arms
of
scotland
within
a
bordure
compony
argent
and
azure
the
bordure
is
assigned
to
fifteen
persons
none
of
them
it
is
believed
of
illegitimate
descent
and
some
expressly
said
to
be
lineallie
and
lawfulie
descended
from
the
ancestor
whose
arms
they
bore
thus
differenced
the
idea
of
this
bordure
having
been
at
any
time
a
mark
of
bastardy
is
a
very
modern
error
arising
from
a
confusion
with
the
bordure
compony
illustration
fig
the
scheme
of
cadency
bordures
devised
by
mr
stodart
in
conclusion
attention
needs
to
be
pointedly
drawn
to
the
fact
that
all
changes
in
arms
are
not
due
to
cadency
nor
is
it
safe
always
to
presume
cadency
from
proved
instances
of
change
instead
of
merely
detailing
isolated
instances
of
variation
in
a
number
of
different
families
the
matter
may
be
better
illustrated
by
closely
following
the
successive
variations
in
the
same
family
and
an
instructive
instance
is
met
with
in
the
case
of
the
arms
of
the
family
of
swinton
of
that
ilk
this
is
peculiarly
instructive
because
at
no
point
in
the
descent
covered
by
the
arms
referred
to
is
there
any
doubt
or
question
as
to
the
fact
of
legitimate
descent
claiming
as
they
do
a
male
descent
and
inheritance
from
liulf
the
son
of
edulf
vicecomes
of
northumbria
whose
possession
before
of
the
lands
of
swinton
is
the
earliest
contemporary
evidence
which
has
come
down
to
us

is
unfortunate
that
we
can
not

their

then
we

upon
it

given

to
the

that

put
by

title
he
bore

this

also
accounts
for

it
has
been
remarked
that
the
knowledge

the
man
in

is
least
incorrect
when
he
knows
nothing
probably
the
only
heraldic
knowledge
that
a
large
number
possess
is
summed
up
in
the
assertion
that
the
heraldic
sign
of
illegitimacy
is
the
bar
sinister
no
doubt
it
is
to
the
novelists
who
seeking
to
touch
lightly
upon
an
unpleasant
subject
have
ignorantly
adopted
a
french
colloquialism
that
we
must
attribute
a
great
deal
of
the
misconception
which
exists
concerning
illegitimacy
and
its
heraldic
marks
of
indication
i
assert
most
unhesitatingly
that
there
are
not
now
and
never
have
been
any
unalterable
laws
as
to
what
these
marks
should
be
and
the
colloquialism
which
insists
upon
the
bar
sinister
is
a
curiously
amusing
example
of
an
utter
misnomer
to
any
one
with
the
most
rudimentary
knowledge
of
heraldry
it
must
plainly
be
seen
to
be
radically
impossible
to
depict
a
bar
sinister
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
bar
is
neither
dexter
nor
sinister
it
is
utterly
impossible
to
draw
a
bar
sinister
such
a
thing
does
not
exist
but
the
assertion
of
many
writers
with
a
knowledge
of
armory
that
bar
sinister
is
a
mistake
for
bend
sinister
is
also
somewhat
misleading
because
the
real
mistake
lies
in
the
spelling
of
the
term
the
barre
sinistre
is
merely
the
french
translation
of
bend
sinister
the
french
word
barre
meaning
a
the
french
barre
is
not
the
english
bar
in
order
to
properly
understand
the
true
significance
of
the
marks
of
illegitimacy
it
is
necessary
that
the
attempt
should
be
made
to
transplant
oneself
into
the
environment
when
the
laws
and
rules
of
heraldry
were
in
the
making
at
that
period
illegitimacy
was
of
little
if
any
account
it
has
not
debarred
the
succession
of
some
of
our
own
sovereigns
although
from
the
earliest
times
the
english
have
always
been
more
prudish
upon
the
point
than
other
nations
in
ireland
even
so
late
as
the
reign
of
queen
elizabeth
it
is
a
striking
genealogical
difficulty
to
decide
in
many
noble
pedigrees
which
if
any
of
the
given
sons
of
any
person
were
legitimate
and
which
of
the
ladies
of
his
household
if
any
might
be
legally
termed
his
wife
in
scotland
we
find
the
same
thing
though
perhaps
it
is
not
quite
so
blatant
to
so
late
a
date
but
considering
what
are
and
have
been
the
scottish
laws
of
marriage
it
is
the
or
otherwise
of
marriage
which
has
to
be
ascertained
and
though
in
england
the
legal
status
was
recognised
from
an
earlier
period
the
social
status
of
the
illegitimate
offspring
of
a
given
man
depended
little
upon
the
legal
legitimacy
of
birth
but
rather
upon
the
amount
of
recognition
the
bastard
received
from
his
father
if
a
man
had
an
unquestionably
legitimate
son
that
son
undoubtedly
succeeded
but
if
he
had
not
any
technical
stain
upon
the
birth
of
the
others
had
little
effect
in
preventing
their
succession
a
study
of
the
succession
to
the
barony
of
meinill
clearly
shows
that
the
illegitimate
son
of
the
second
lord
meinill
succeeded
to
the
estates
and
peerage
of
his
father
in
preference
to
his
legitimate
uncle
there
are
many
other
analogous
cases
and
when
the
church
juggled
at
its
pleasure
with
the
sacrament
of
marriage
dispensing
and
annulling
or
recognising
marriages
for
reasons
which
we
nowadays
can
only
term
whimsical
small
wonder
is
it
that
the
legal
fact
though
then
admitted
had
little
of
the
importance
which
we
now
give
to
it
when
the
actual
fact
was
so
little
more
than
a
matter
at
the
personal
pleasure
of
the
person
most
concerned
it
would
be
ridiculous
to
suppose
that
any
perpetuation
of
a
mere
advertisement
of
the
fact
would
be
considered
necessary
whilst
the
fact
itself
was
so
often
ignored
so
that
until
comparatively
recent
times
the
crown
certainly
never
attempted
to
enforce
any
heraldic
marks
of
illegitimacy
rather
were
these
enforced
by
the
legitimate
descendants
if
and
when
such
descendants
existed
the
point
must
have
first
arisen
when
there
were
both
legitimate
and
illegitimate
descendants
of
a
given
person
and
it
was
desired
to
make
record
of
the
true
line
in
which
land
or
honours
should
descend
to
effect
this
purpose
the
arms
of
the
illegitimate
son
were
made
to
carry
some
charge
or
alteration
to
show
that
there
was
some
reason
which
debarred
inheritance
by
their
users
whilst
there
remained
those
entitled
to
bear
the
arms
without
the
mark
of
distinction
but
be
it
noted
that
this
obligation
existed
equally
on
the
legitimate
cadets
of
a
family
and
in
the
earliest
periods
of
heraldry
there
is
little
or
no
distinction
either
in
the
marks
employed
or
in
the
character
of
the
marks
which
can
be
drawn
between
mere
marks
of
cadency
and
marks
of
illegitimacy
until
a
comparatively
recent
period
it
is
absolutely
unsafe
to
use
these
marks
as
signifying
or
proving
either
legitimate
cadency
or
illegitimacy
the
same
mark
stood
for
both
the
only
object
which
any
distinctive
change
accomplished
being
the
distinction
which
it
was
necessary
to
draw
between
those
who
owned
the
right
to
the
undifferenced
arms
and
owned
the
land
and
those
who
did
not
the
object
was
to
safeguard
the
right
of
the
real
possessors
and
their
true
heirs
and
not
to
penalise
the
others
there
was
no
particular
mark
either
for
cadency
or
for
illegitimacy
the
distinctions
made
being
dictated
by
what
seemed
the
most
suitable
and
distinctive
mark
applicable
to
the
arms
under
consideration
when
that
much
has
been
thoroughly
grasped
one
gets
a
more
accurate
understanding
of
the
subject
one
other
point
has
to
be
borne
in
mind
and
to
the
present
generation
which
knows
so
well
how
extensively
arms
have
been
improperly
assumed
the
statement
may
seem
startling
and
that
is
that
the
use
of
arms
was
formerly
evidence
of
pedigree
as
late
as
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
evidence
of
this
character
was
submitted
to
the
committee
of
privileges
at
the
hearing
of
a
peerage
case
the
evidence
was
for
that
purpose
though
doubt
in
that
case
very
properly
was
thrown
upon
its
value
therefore
in
view
of
the
two
foregoing
facts
there
can
be
very
little
doubt
that
the
use
of
armorial
marks
of
bastardy
not
invented
or
instituted
nor
were
these
marks
enforced
as
punishment
or
as
a
it
is
a
curious
instance
how
a
careful
study
of
words
and
terms
employed
will
often
afford
either
a
clue
or
confirmation
when
the
true
meaning
of
the
term
has
long
been
overlooked
the
official
term
for
a
mark
of
cadency
is
a
difference
mark
it
was
a
mark
to
show
the
difference
between
one
member
of
a
family
and
another
the
mark
used
to
signify
a
lack
of
blood
relationship
and
a
mark
used
to
signify
illegitimacy
are
each
termed
a
mark
of
distinction
a
mark
that
shall
make
something
plainly
distinct
what
is
that
something
the
fact
that
the
use
of
the
arms
is
not
evidence
of
descent
through
which
heirship
can
be
claimed
or
proved
this
by
the
way
is
a
patent
example
of
the
advantage
of
adherence
to
precedent
the
inevitable
conclusion
is
that
a
bastard
was
originally
only
required
to
mark
his
shield
sufficiently
that
it
should
be
distinctly
apparent
that
heirship
would
never
accrue
the
arms
had
to
be
distinct
from
those
borne
by
those
members
of
the
family
upon
whom
heirship
might
devolve
the
social
position
of
a
bastard
as
belonging
to
a
family
was
pretty
generally
conceded
therefore
he
carried
their
arms
sufficiently
marked
to
show
he
was
not
in
the
line
of
succession
this
being
accepted
one
at
once
understands
the
great
variety
of
the
marks
which
have
been
employed
these
answered
the
purpose
of
distinction
and
nothing
more
was
demanded
or
necessary
consequently
a
recapitulation
of
marks
of
which
examples
can
be
quoted
would
be
largely
a
list
of
isolated
instances
and
as
such
they
are
useless
for
the
purposes
of
deduction
in
any
attempt
to
arrive
at
a
correct
conclusion
as
to
what
the
ancient
rules
were
in
brief
there
were
no
rules
until
the
eighteenth
or
perhaps
even
until
the
nineteenth
century
the
only
rule
was
that
the
arms
must
be
sufficiently
marked
in
way
this
is
borne
out
by
the
dictum
of
menêstrier
except
the
label
which
has
been
elsewhere
referred
to
the
earliest
marks
of
either
cadency
or
illegitimacy
for
which
accepted
use
can
be
found
are
the
bend
and
the
bordure
but
the
bend
for
the
purpose
of
illegitimacy
seems
to
be
the
earlier
and
a
bend
superimposed
over
a
shield
remained
a
mark
of
illegitimate
cadency
until
a
comparatively
late
period
this
bend
as
a
difference
naturally
was
originally
depicted
as
a
bend
dexter
and
as
a
mark
of
legitimate
cadency
is
found
in
the
arms
of
the
son
of
edmund
crouchback
earl
of
lancaster
before
he
succeeded
his
elder
brother
there
are
scores
of
other
similar
instances
which
a
little
research
will
show
whether
the
term
marriage
is
the
older
and
the
sinister
bend
is
derived
therefrom
or
whether
the
slang
term
is
derived
from
the
sinister
bend
it
is
perhaps
not
necessary
to
inquire
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
from
an
early
period
the
bend
of
cadency
when
such
cadency
was
illegitimate
is
frequently
met
with
in
the
sinister
form
but
concurrently
with
such
usage
instances
are
found
in
which
the
dexter
bend
was
used
for
the
same
purpose
and
it
is
very
plainly
evident
that
it
was
never
at
that
date
looked
upon
as
a
penalty
but
was
used
merely
as
a
or
for
the
purpose
of
showing
that
the
wearer
was
not
the
head
of
his
house
or
in
possession
of
the
lordship
the
territorial
idea
of
the
nature
of
arms
which
has
been
alluded
to
in
the
chapter
upon
marks
of
cadency
should
be
borne
in
mind
in
coming
to
a
conclusion
soon
after
the
recognition
of
the
bend
as
a
mark
of
illegitimacy
we
come
across
the
bordure
but
there
is
some
confusion
with
this
bordures
of
all
kinds
being
used
indiscriminately
to
denote
both
legitimate
and
illegitimate
cadency
there
are
countless
other
forms
of
marking
illegitimacy
and
it
is
impossible
to
attempt
to
summarise
them
and
absolutely
impossible
to
draw
conclusions
as
to
any
family
from
marks
upon
its
arms
when
this
point
is
under
discussion
to
give
a
list
of
these
instances
would
rather
seem
an
attempt
to
deduce
a
rule
or
rules
upon
the
point
so
i
say
at
once
that
there
was
no
recognised
mark
and
any
plain
distinction
seems
to
have
been
accepted
as
sufficient
and
no
distinction
whatever
was
made
when
the
illegitimate
son
either
from
failure
of
legitimate
issue
or
other
reason
succeeded
to
the
lands
and
honours
of
his
father
out
of
the
multitude
of
marks
the
bend
and
subsequently
the
bend
sinister
emerge
as
most
frequently
in
use
and
finally
the
bend
sinister
exclusively
so
that
it
has
come
to
be
considered
and
perhaps
correctly
as
regards
one
period
that
its
use
was
equivalent
to
a
mark
of
illegitimacy
in
england
but
there
has
always
remained
to
the
person
of
bastard
descent
the
right
of
discarding
the
bastardised
coat
and
adopting
a
new
coat
of
arms
the
only
requirement
as
to
the
new
coat
being
that
it
shall
be
so
distinct
from
the
old
one
as
not
to
be
liable
to
confusion
therewith
and
it
is
a
moot
point
whether
or
not
a
large
proportion
of
the
instances
which
are
tabulated
in
most
heraldic
works
as
examples
of
marks
of
bastardy
are
anything
whatever
of
the
kind
my
own
opinion
is
that
many
are
not
and
that
it
is
a
mistake
to
so
consider
them
the
true
explanation
undoubtedly
in
some
and
outside
the
royal
family
probably
in
most
being
that
they
are
new
coats
of
arms
adopted
new
coats
of
arms
doubtless
bearing
relation
to
the
old
family
coat
but
sufficiently
distinguished
therefrom
to
rank
as
new
arms
and
were
never
intended
to
be
taken
as
and
never
were
bastardised
examples
of
formerly
existing
coats
it
is
for
this
reason
that
i
have
refrained
from
giving
any
extensive
list
such
as
is
to
be
found
in
most
other
treatises
on
heraldry
for
all
that
can
be
said
for
such
lists
is
that
they
are
lists
of
the
specific
arms
of
specific
bastards
which
is
a
very
different
matter
from
a
list
of
heraldic
marks
of
illegitimacy
another
objection
to
the
long
lists
which
most
heraldic
works
give
of
early
instances
of
marks
of
bastardy
as
data
for
deduction
lies
in
the
fact
that
most
are
instances
of
the
illegitimate
children
of
royal
personages
it
is
singularly
unsafe
to
draw
deductions
to
be
applied
to
the
arms
of
others
from
the
royal
arms
for
these
generally
have
laws
unto
themselves
the
bend
sinister
in
its
bare
simplicity
as
a
mark
of
illegitimacy
was
seldom
used
the
more
frequent
form
being
the
sinister
bendlet
or
even
the
diminutive
of
that
the
cottise
there
is
no
doubt
of
course
that
when
a
sinister
bend
or
bendlet
debruises
another
coat
that
that
is
a
bastardised
version
of
an
older
coat
but
examples
can
be
found
of
the
sinister
bend
as
a
charge
which
has
no
reference
whatever
to
illegitimacy
two
instances
that
come
to
mind
which
can
be
found
by
reference
to
any
current
peerage
are
the
arms
of
shiffner
and
certainly
in
these
cases
i
know
of
no
illegitimacy
and
neither
coat
is
a
bastardised
version
of
an
older
existing
coat
anciently
the
bendlet
was
drawn
across
arms
and
quarterings
and
an
example
of
a
coat
of
arms
of
some
number
of
quarterings
debruised
for
an
illegitimate
family
is
found
in
the
registration
of
a
talbot
pedigree
in
one
of
the
visitation
books
as
a
mark
of
distinction
upon
arms
the
bend
sinister
for
long
past
has
fallen
out
of
use
though
for
the
purpose
of
differencing
crests
a
bendlet
wavy
sinister
is
still
made
use
of
and
will
be
again
presently
referred
to
next
to
the
bend
comes
the
bordure
bordures
of
all
kinds
were
used
for
the
purposes
of
cadency
from
practically
the
earliest
periods
of
heraldic
differencing
but
they
were
used
indiscriminately
as
has
been
already
stated
both
for
legitimate
and
illegitimate
cadency
john
of
gaunt
as
is
well
known
was
the
father
of
henry
iv
and
the
ancestor
of
henry
the
former
being
the
issue
of
his
legitimate
wife
the
latter
coming
from
a
son
who
as
one
of
the
old
chroniclers
puts
it
was
of
double
advowtrie
begotten
but
as
every
one
knows
john
of
gaunt
children
by
catherine
roet
or
swynford
were
legitimated
by
act
of
parliament
the
act
of
parliament
not
excepting
the
succession
to
the
throne
a
disability
later
introduced
in
letters
patent
of
the
crown
when
giving
a
subsequent
confirmation
of
the
act
but
which
nevertheless
they
could
not
overrule
but
taking
the
sons
of
the
latter
family
as
legitimate
which
whatever
may
have
been
the
moral
aspect
of
the
case
they
were
undoubtedly
in
the
eyes
of
the
common
law
after
the
passing
of
the
act
referred
to
they
existed
concurrently
with
the
undoubtedly
senior
descendants
of
the
first
marriage
of
john
of
gaunt
with
blanche
of
lancaster
and
it
was
necessary
whether
they
were
legitimate
or
not
to
distinguish
the
arms
of
the
junior
from
the
senior
branch
the
result
was
that
as
legitimate
cadets
and
not
as
bastards
the
arms
of
john
of
gaunt
were
differenced
for
the
line
of
the
dukes
of
somerset
by
the
addition
of
the
bordure
compony
argent
and
azure
the
livery
colours
of
lancaster
it
is
a
weird
position
for
these
colours
were
derived
from
the
family
of
the
legitimate
wife
the
fight
as
to
whether
these
children
were
legitimate
or
illegitimate
was
of
course
notorious
and
a
matter
of
history
but
from
the
fact
that
they
bore
a
bordure
compony
an
idea
grew
up
both
in
this
country
and
in
scotland
also
from
the
similarity
of
the
cases
of
the
doubtful
legitimacy
of
the
avondale
and
ochiltree
stewarts
who
both
used
the
bordure
compony
that
the
bordure
compony
was
a
sign
of
illegitimacy
whereas
in
both
countries
at
an
earlier
period
it
undoubtedly
was
accepted
as
a
mark
of
legitimate
cadency
as
a
mark
of
bastardy
it
had
subsequently
some
extensive
use
in
both
countries
and
it
still
remains
the
only
mark
now
used
for
the
purpose
in
scottish
heraldry
whether
it
was
that
it
was
not
considered
as
of
a
fixed
nature
or
whether
it
was
that
it
had
become
notorious
and
unacceptable
it
is
difficult
to
say
though
the
officers
of
arms
have
been
blamed
for
making
a
change
on
the
assumption
that
it
was
the
latter
some
writers
who
clamour
strongly
for
the
of
bastard
arms
and
for
the
plain
and
recognisable
marking
of
them
as
such
a
position
adopted
rather
vehemently
by
woodward
a
singularly
erudite
heraldic
writer
are
rather
uncharitable
and
at
the
same
time
rather
lacking
in
due
observation
and
careful
consideration
of
ancient
ideas
and
ancient
precedents
that
the
recognised
mark
has
been
changed
at
different
periods
and
as
a
consequence
that
to
a
certain
extent
the
advertisement
it
conveys
has
been
less
patent
is
of
course
put
down
to
the
venality
of
mediæval
heralds
happily
their
backs
are
broad
by
those
who
are
too
to
observe
that
the
one
thing
an
official
herald
moves
heaven
and
earth
to
escape
from
is
the
making
of
a
new
precedent
and
that
on
the
score
of
signs
of
illegitimacy
the
official
heralds
when
the
control
of
arms
passed
into
their
hands
found
no
established
rule
so
far
from
having
been
guilty
of
venality
as
woodward
suggests
they
have
erred
on
the
other
side
and
by
having
worked
only
on
the
limited
number
of
precedents
they
found
they
have
stereotyped
the
advertisement
and
thereby
made
the
situation
more
stringent
than
they
found
it
we
have
it
from
biblical
sources
that
the
sins
of
the
fathers
shall
be
visited
upon
the
children
unto
the
third
and
fourth
generations
and
this
spirit
has
undoubtedly
crept
into
the
views
of
many
writers
but
to
get
into
the
true
perspective
of
the
matter
one
needs
to
consider
the
subject
from
the
point
of
view
of
less
prudish
days
than
our
own
i
have
no
wish
to
be
misunderstood
in
these
days
much
heraldic
reviewing
of
the
blatant
and
baser
sort
depends
not
upon
the
value
of
the
work
performed
a
point
of
view
which
is
never
given
a
thought
but
entirely
upon
the
identity
of
the
writer
whose
work
is
under
review
and
is
largely
composed
of
misquotation
and
misrepresentation
it
may
perhaps
be
as
well
therefore
to
state
that
i
am
not
seeking
to
condone
illegitimacy
or
to
combat
present
opinions
upon
the
point
i
merely
state
that
our
present
opinions
are
a
modern
growth
and
that
in
the
thirteenth
fourteenth
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
when
the
fundamental
principles
of
heraldry
were
in
the
making
it
was
not
considered
a
disgrace
to
have
an
illegitimate
son
nor
was
it
considered
then
that
to
be
of
illegitimate
birth
carried
the
personal
stigma
that
came
later
at
any
rate
the
fact
remains
that
a
new
mark
was
called
into
being
in
england
about
the
year
when
in
a
grant
to
zachary
to
quarter
the
arms
of
sacheverell
from
which
family
he
was
in
the
female
line
illegitimately
descended
the
bordure
wavy
was
first
met
with
as
a
sufficient
and
proper
mark
of
illegitimacy
the
curious
point
is
that
before
that
date
in
scotland
and
in
england
the
bordure
wavy
possessed
nothing
of
this
character
and
to
the
present
day
the
bordure
wavy
in
scotland
is
undoubtedly
nothing
more
than
a
legitimate
mark
of
legitimate
cadency
for
which
mark
stodart
provides
a
place
in
the
scheme
of
differencing
which
he
tabulated
as
the
basis
of
cadency
marks
in
scotland
fig
since
that
date
the
bordure
wavy
has
remained
the
mark
which
has
been
used
for
the
purpose
in
england
as
the
bordure
compony
has
remained
the
mark
in
scotland
bearing
in
mind
that
the
only
necessity
was
some
mark
which
should
carry
sufficient
from
the
arms
of
the
family
it
follows
as
a
natural
consequence
of
human
nature
that
as
soon
as
any
particular
mark
became
identified
with
illegitimacy
after
that
was
considered
to
be
a
stigma
that
mark
was
quietly
dropped
and
some
other
substituted
and
no
one
should
be
surprised
to
find
the
bordures
wavy
and
compony
quietly
displaced
by
something
else
if
any
change
is
to
be
made
in
the
future
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
no
existing
mark
will
be
adopted
and
that
the
marks
in
england
and
scotland
shall
not
conflict
even
if
they
do
not
coincide
the
bendlet
sinister
however
survives
in
the
form
of
the
baton
sinister
which
is
a
bendlet
couped
placed
across
the
centre
of
the
shield
the
baton
sinister
however
is
a
privilege
which
as
a
charge
on
a
shield
is
reserved
such
as
it
is
for
royal
bastards
the
latest
instance
of
this
was
in
the
exemplification
of
arms
to
the
earl
of
munster
and
his
brothers
and
sisters
early
in
the
nineteenth
century
other
surviving
instances
are
met
with
in
the
arms
of
the
duke
of
albans
and
the
duke
of
grafton
another
privilege
of
royal
bastards
is
that
they
may
have
the
baton
of
a
privilege
which
is
according
to
berry
denied
to
those
of
humbler
origin
according
to
present
law
the
position
of
an
illegitimate
person
heraldically
is
based
upon
the
common
law
of
the
country
which
practically
declares
that
an
illegitimate
child
has
no
name
no
parentage
and
no
relations
the
illegitimacy
of
birth
is
an
insuperable
bar
to
inheritance
and
a
person
of
illegitimate
birth
inherits
no
arms
at
all
the
popular
idea
that
he
inherits
a
right
to
the
arms
subject
to
a
mark
of
distinction
being
quite
incorrect
he
has
none
at
all
there
has
never
been
any
mark
which
as
a
matter
of
course
and
of
mere
motion
could
attach
itself
automatically
to
a
shield
as
is
the
case
with
the
english
marks
of
difference
the
crescent
of
the
second
son
or
the
mullet
of
the
third
this
is
a
point
upon
which
i
have
found
mistaken
ideas
very
frequently
held
even
by
those
who
have
made
some
study
of
heraldry
but
a
very
little
thought
should
make
it
plain
that
by
the
very
nature
of
the
fact
there
can
not
be
either
a
recognised
mark
compulsory
use
or
an
sign
illegitimacy
is
negative
not
positive
a
fact
which
many
writers
hardly
give
sufficient
weight
to
if
any
one
of
illegitimate
birth
desires
to
obtain
a
right
to
arms
he
has
two
courses
open
to
him
he
can
either
not
disclosing
the
fact
of
his
illegitimacy
and
not
attempting
to
prove
that
he
is
a
descendant
of
any
kind
from
any
one
else
apply
for
and
obtain
a
new
grant
of
arms
on
his
own
basis
and
worry
through
the
college
the
grant
of
a
coat
as
closely
following
in
design
that
of
the
old
family
as
he
can
get
which
means
that
he
would
be
treated
and
penalised
with
such
not
marks
of
distinction
as
would
be
imposed
upon
a
stranger
in
blood
endeavouring
to
obtain
arms
founded
upon
a
coat
to
which
he
had
no
right
the
cost
of
such
a
proceeding
in
england
is
the
usual
fees
upon
an
ordinary
grant
the
alternative
course
is
simple
he
must
avow
himself
a
bastard
and
must
prove
his
paternity
or
maternity
as
the
case
may
be
for
in
the
eye
of
the
law
common
and
heraldic
he
bears
the
same
relation
which
is
nil
and
the
same
right
to
the
name
and
arms
which
is
nil
of
both
his
father
and
his
mother
illegitimacy
under
english
law
affords
one
of
the
many
instances
in
which
anomalies
exist
for
strange
as
the
statement
is
a
bastard
comes
into
the
world
without
any
name
at
all
legally
at
birth
a
bastard
child
has
then
no
name
at
all
and
no
arms
it
must
subsequently
acquire
such
right
to
a
name
whatever
right
that
may
amount
to
as
user
of
and
reputation
therein
may
give
him
he
inherits
no
arms
at
all
no
name
and
no
property
save
by
specific
devise
or
bequest
the
lack
of
parents
operates
as
a
which
it
is
impossible
to
bridge
it
is
not
a
case
of
a
peculiar
bridge
or
a
faulty
bridge
there
is
no
bridge
at
all
names
in
so
far
as
they
are
matters
of
law
are
subject
to
canon
law
at
any
rate
the
law
upon
the
subject
such
as
it
is
originated
in
canon
law
and
not
in
statute
or
common
law
canon
law
was
made
and
has
never
since
been
altered
at
a
time
when
surnames
were
not
in
existence
a
bastard
no
more
inherits
the
surname
of
the
mother
than
it
does
the
surname
of
its
father
and
the
spirit
of
petty
officialism
so
rampant
amongst
the
clergy
which
seeks
to
impose
upon
a
bastard
the
surname
of
its
mother
has
no
justification
in
law
or
fact
a
bastard
has
precisely
as
little
right
to
the
surname
of
its
mother
as
it
has
to
the
surname
of
its
father
obviously
however
under
the
customs
of
our
present
social
life
every
person
must
have
a
surname
of
one
kind
or
another
and
it
is
here
that
the
anomaly
in
the
british
law
exists
inasmuch
as
neither
statute
nor
canon
law
provide
any
means
for
conferring
a
surname
that
the
king
has
the
prerogative
and
exercises
it
of
conferring
or
confirming
surnames
is
of
course
unquestioned
but
it
is
hardly
to
be
supposed
that
the
king
will
trouble
himself
to
provide
a
surname
for
every
illegitimate
child
which
may
be
born
and
outside
this
prerogative
which
probably
is
exercised
about
once
a
year
there
is
no
method
provided
or
definitely
recognised
by
the
law
to
meet
this
necessity
to
obviate
the
difficulty
the
surname
has
to
be
that
which
is
conferred
upon
the
child
by
general
custom
and
as
an
illegitimate
child
is
in
cases
out
of
a
hundred
brought
up
by
its
mother
it
is
usually
by
the
same
custom
which
confers
the
surname
of
its
owner
upon
a
dog
in
so
many
parts
of
the
country
that
a
bastard
child
gets
known
by
its
mother
surname
and
consequently
has
that
surname
conferred
upon
it
by
general
custom
the
only
names
that
an
illegitimate
child
has
an
inalienable
right
to
are
the
names
by
which
it
is
baptized
and
if
two
names
are
given
and
the
child
or
its
guardians
elect
that
it
should
be
known
only
by
those
baptismal
names
and
if
common
repute
and
general
custom
as
would
be
probable
uses
the
last
of
those
names
as
a
surname
there
is
no
legal
power
on
earth
which
can
force
upon
the
child
any
other
name
and
if
the
last
of
the
baptismal
names
happens
to
be
its
father
surname
the
child
will
have
an
absolute
right
to
be
known
only
by
its
christian
names
which
to
all
intents
and
purposes
will
mean
that
it
will
be
known
by
its
father
surname
in
the
same
way
that
an
illegitimate
child
inherits
no
surname
at
all
it
equally
inherits
no
arms
consequently
it
has
no
shield
upon
which
to
carry
a
mark
of
bastardy
if
such
a
mark
happened
to
be
in
existence
but
if
under
a
will
or
deed
of
settlement
an
illegitimate
child
is
required
to
assume
the
name
and
arms
of
its
father
of
its
a
royal
licence
to
assume
such
name
and
arms
is
considered
to
be
necessary
it
may
be
here
noted
that
voluntary
applications
to
assume
a
name
and
arms
in
the
case
of
an
illegitimate
child
are
not
entertained
unless
it
can
be
clearly
shown
which
is
not
always
an
easy
matter
what
the
parentage
really
was
it
will
be
noticed
that
i
have
said
he
will
be
required
to
prove
his
paternity
this
is
rigorously
insisted
upon
inasmuch
as
it
is
not
fair
to
penalise
the
reputation
of
a
dead
man
by
inflicting
upon
him
a
record
of
bastard
descendants
whilst
his
own
life
might
have
been
stainless
an
illegitimate
birth
is
generally
recorded
under
the
name
of
the
mother
only
and
even
when
it
is
given
the
truth
of
any
statement
as
to
paternity
is
always
open
to
grave
suspicion
there
is
nothing
therefore
to
prevent
a
person
asserting
that
he
is
the
son
of
a
duke
whereas
his
real
father
may
have
been
in
a
very
plebeian
walk
in
life
and
to
put
the
arms
of
the
duke
family
at
the
mercy
of
any
fatherless
person
who
chose
to
fancy
a
differenced
version
of
them
would
be
manifestly
unjust
so
that
without
proof
in
a
legal
action
of
the
actual
paternity
or
some
recognition
under
a
will
or
settlement
it
is
impossible
to
adopt
the
alternative
in
question
but
if
such
recognition
or
proof
is
forthcoming
the
procedure
is
to
petition
the
sovereign
for
a
royal
licence
to
use
or
continue
to
use
the
name
desired
and
to
bear
the
arms
of
the
family
such
a
petition
is
always
granted
on
proper
proof
of
the
facts
if
made
in
due
form
through
the
proper
channels
the
royal
licence
to
that
effect
is
then
issued
but
the
document
contains
two
conditions
the
first
being
that
the
arms
shall
be
exemplified
according
to
the
laws
of
arms
with
due
and
proper
marks
of
distinction
and
that
the
royal
licence
shall
be
recorded
in
the
college
of
arms
otherwise
to
be
void
and
of
none
effect
the
invariable
insertion
of
this
clause
puts
into
the
hands
of
the
college
one
of
the
strongest
weapons
the
officers
of
arms
possess
under
the
present
practice
the
due
and
proper
marks
of
distinction
are
for
the
arms
a
bordure
wavy
round
the
shield
of
the
most
suitable
colour
according
to
what
the
arms
may
be
but
if
possible
of
some
colour
or
metal
different
from
any
of
the
tinctures
in
the
arms
the
crest
is
usually
differenced
by
a
bendlet
sinister
wavy
but
a
pallet
wavy
is
sometimes
used
and
sometimes
a
saltire
wavy
couped
or
otherwise
the
choice
between
these
marks
generally
depends
upon
the
nature
of
the
crest
but
even
with
this
choice
the
anomaly
is
frequently
found
of
blank
space
being
carefully
debruised
seeing
that
the
mark
of
the
debruising
is
not
a
tangible
object
or
thing
but
a
mark
painted
upon
another
object
such
a
result
seems
singularly
ridiculous
and
ought
to
be
avoided
whilst
the
ancient
practice
certainly
appears
to
have
been
to
make
some
slight
change
in
the
crest
it
does
not
seem
to
have
been
debruised
in
the
present
manner
there
are
some
number
of
more
recent
cases
where
whilst
the
existing
arms
have
been
charged
with
the
necessary
marks
of
distinction
entirely
new
or
very
much
altered
crests
have
been
granted
without
any
recognisable
marks
of
distinction
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
bendlet
wavy
sinister
upon
the
crest
is
a
palpable
penalising
of
the
bearer
and
i
think
the
whole
subject
of
the
marks
of
bastardy
in
the
three
kingdoms
might
with
advantage
be
brought
under
official
consideration
with
a
view
to
new
regulations
being
adopted
a
bendlet
wavy
sinister
is
such
an
absolute
defacement
of
a
crest
that
few
can
care
to
make
use
of
a
crest
so
marked
it
carries
an
effect
far
beyond
what
was
originally
the
intention
of
marks
of
distinction
a
few
recent
bastardised
exemplifications
which
have
issued
from
office
have
had
the
crest
charged
with
a
baton
couped
sinister
the
baton
couped
sinister
had
always
hitherto
been
confined
to
the
arms
of
royal
bastards
but
i
am
not
aware
of
any
royal
crest
so
bastardised
of
course
no
circumstances
can
be
conceived
in
which
it
is
necessary
to
debruise
supporters
as
under
no
circumstances
can
these
be
the
subject
of
a
royal
licence
of
this
character
except
in
a
possible
case
where
they
might
have
been
granted
as
a
simple
augmentation
to
a
man
and
his
descendants
without
further
limitation
i
know
of
no
bastardised
version
consequent
upon
such
a
grant
supporters
signify
some
definite
honour
which
can
not
ordinarily
survive
illegitimacy
the
bordure
wavy
is
placed
round
the
pronominal
arms
only
and
no
right
to
any
quarterings
the
family
may
have
enjoyed
previously
is
conferred
except
such
right
to
a
quarterly
coat
as
might
ensue
through
the
assumption
of
a
double
name
quartering
is
held
to
signify
representation
which
can
not
be
given
by
a
royal
licence
but
a
quartering
of
augmentation
or
a
duplicate
coat
for
the
pronominal
name
which
had
been
so
regularly
used
with
the
alternative
coat
as
to
constitute
the
two
something
in
the
nature
of
a
compound
coat
would
be
exemplified
all
within
a
bordure
wavy
each
illegitimate
coat
stands
on
its
own
basis
and
there
is
a
instance
in
which
a
marriage
was
subsequently
found
to
be
illegal
or
to
have
never
taken
place
after
which
i
believe
some
number
of
brothers
and
sisters
obtained
royal
licences
and
exemplifications
the
descendants
of
one
of
the
brothers
will
be
found
in
the
current
peerage
books
and
those
who
know
their
peerage
history
well
will
recognise
the
case
i
allude
to
all
the
brothers
and
sisters
had
the
same
arms
exemplified
each
with
a
bordure
wavy
a
different
if
there
were
descendants
of
any
of
the
sisters
those
descendants
would
have
been
entitled
to
quarter
the
arms
because
the
illegitimacy
made
each
sister
an
heiress
for
heraldic
purposes
this
is
a
curious
anomaly
for
had
they
been
legitimate
the
descendants
would
have
enjoyed
no
such
right
in
scotland
the
mark
of
illegitimacy
for
the
arms
is
the
bordure
compony
which
is
usually
but
not
always
indicative
of
the
same
the
bordure
has
been
occasionally
stated
to
have
the
same
character
this
is
hardly
correct
though
it
may
be
so
in
a
few
isolated
cases
but
the
bordure
chequy
has
nothing
whatever
of
an
illegitimate
character
it
will
be
noticed
that
whilst
the
bordure
compony
and
the
bordure
have
their
chequers
or
panes
to
use
the
heraldic
term
following
the
outline
of
the
shield
by
lines
parallel
to
those
which
mark
its
contour
the
bordure
chequy
is
drawn
by
lines
parallel
to
and
at
right
angles
to
the
palar
line
of
the
shield
irrespective
of
its
outline
a
bordure
chequy
must
of
course
at
one
point
or
another
show
three
distinct
rows
of
checks
the
bastardising
of
crests
even
in
england
is
a
comparatively
modern
practice
i
know
of
no
single
instance
ancient
or
modern
of
the
kind
in
scottish
heraldry
though
i
could
mention
scores
of
achievements
in
which
the
shields
carry
marks
of
distinction
this
is
valuable
evidence
for
no
matter
how
lax
the
official
practice
of
scottish
armory
may
have
been
at
one
period
the
theory
of
scottish
armory
far
more
nearly
approaches
the
ancient
practices
and
rules
of
heraldry
than
does
the
armory
of
any
other
country
that
theory
is
much
nearer
the
ideal
theory
than
the
english
one
but
unfortunately
for
the
practical
purposes
of
modern
heraldic
needs
it
does
not
answer
so
well
at
the
present
day
therefore
a
scottish
crest
is
not
marked
in
any
way
most
handbooks
refer
to
a
certain
rule
which
is
supposed
to
exist
for
the
differencing
of
a
coat
to
denote
illegitimacy
when
the
coat
is
that
of
the
mother
and
not
the
father
the
supposed
method
being
to
depict
the
arms
under
a
surcoat
the
result
being
much
the
same
as
if
the
whole
of
the
arms
appeared
in
exaggerated
flaunches
the
remainder
of
the
shield
being
left
vacant
except
for
the
tincture
of
the
surcoat
as
a
matter
of
fact
only
one
instance
is
known
and
consequently
we
must
consider
it
as
a
new
coat
devised
to
bear
reference
to
the
old
one
and
not
as
a
regularised
method
of
differencing
for
a
particular
set
of
circumstances
in
ireland
the
rules
are
to
all
intents
and
purposes
the
same
as
in
england
with
the
exception
of
the
occasional
use
of
a
sinister
baton
instead
of
a
bendlet
wavy
sinister
upon
the
crest
in
scotland
where
royal
licences
are
unknown
it
is
merely
necessary
to
prove
paternity
and
rematriculate
the
arms
with
due
and
proper
marks
of
distinction
it
was
a
very
general
idea
during
a
former
period
but
subsequently
to
the
time
when
the
bend
and
bendlet
sinister
and
the
bordure
were
recognised
as
in
the
nature
of
the
accepted
marks
of
bastardy
and
when
their
penal
nature
was
admitted
that
whatever
mark
was
adopted
for
the
purpose
of
indicating
illegitimacy
need
only
be
borne
for
three
generations
some
of
the
older
authorities
tell
us
that
after
that
length
of
time
had
elapsed
it
might
be
discarded
and
some
other
and
less
objectionable
mark
be
taken
in
its
place
the
older
writers
were
striving
consciously
or
unconsciously
to
reconcile
the
disgrace
of
illegitimacy
which
they
knew
with
heraldic
facts
which
they
also
knew
and
to
reconcile
in
certain
prominent
families
undoubted
illegitimacy
with
unmarked
arms
the
probability
being
that
their
sense
of
justice
and
regard
for
heraldry
prompted
them
to
the
remark
that
some
other
mark
of
distinction
to
be
added
whilst
all
the
time
they
knew
it
never
was
the
arms
of
byron
somerset
meinill
and
herbert
are
all
cases
where
the
marks
of
illegitimacy
have
been
quietly
dropped
entire
reversion
being
had
to
the
undifferenced
original
coat
at
a
time
when
marks
of
illegitimacy
both
in
fact
and
in
theory
were
nothing
more
than
marks
of
cadency
and
difference
from
the
arms
of
the
head
of
the
house
it
was
no
venality
of
the
heralds
but
merely
the
acceptance
of
current
ideas
that
permitted
them
to
recognise
the
undifferenced
arms
for
the
illegitimate
descendants
when
there
were
no
legitimate
owners
from
whose
claim
the
arms
of
the
others
needed
to
be
differentiated
and
when
lordships
and
lands
had
lapsed
to
a
bastard
branch
to
this
fact
must
be
added
another
the
armorial
control
of
the
heralds
after
the
days
of
tournaments
was
exercised
through
the
visitations
and
the
earl
court
peers
were
never
subject
to
the
visitations
and
so
were
not
under
control
unless
their
arms
were
challenged
in
the
earl
marshal
court
by
the
rightful
owner
the
cases
that
were
notorious
are
cases
of
the
arms
of
peers
the
visitations
gave
the
officers
of
arms
greater
control
over
the
arms
of
commoners
than
they
had
had
theretofore
and
the
growing
social
opinions
upon
legitimacy
and
marriage
brought
social
observances
more
into
conformity
with
the
technical
law
and
made
that
technical
law
of
no
inheritance
and
no
paternity
an
operative
fact
the
result
is
that
the
hard
legal
fact
is
now
rigidly
and
rightly
insisted
upon
and
the
claim
and
right
to
arms
of
one
of
illegitimate
descent
depends
and
is
made
to
depend
solely
upon
the
instruments
creating
that
right
and
the
conditions
of
due
and
proper
marks
of
distinction
always
subject
to
which
the
right
is
called
into
being
nowadays
there
is
no
release
from
the
penalty
of
the
bordures
wavy
and
compony
save
through
the
avenue
of
a
new
and
totally
different
grant
and
the
full
fees
payable
therefor
but
as
the
bearer
of
a
bordure
wavy
once
remarked
to
me
i
had
rather
descend
illegitimately
from
a
good
family
and
bear
their
arms
marked
than
descend
from
a
lot
of
nobodies
and
use
a
new
grant
but
until
the
common
law
is
altered
if
it
ever
is
the
game
must
be
played
fairly
and
the
conditions
of
a
royal
licence
observed
for
the
sins
of
the
fathers
are
visited
upon
the
children
although
i
have
refrained
from
giving
any
extended
list
of
bastardised
coats
as
examples
of
the
rules
for
indicating
illegitimacy
reference
may
nevertheless
be
made
to
various
curious
examples
the

occasionally
been
used

similar
instance
can
be
found
in
modern
times

arms

bastardised

manner

paternal
arms

the
creation
of
a
coat
it
was
followed
by
the
beauforts
before
their
legitimation
and
by
sir

the
illegitimate

of
the
black

derived

the

have
discarded

was
continued

the
marshalling
of
arms
the
science
of
marshalling
is
the
conjoining
of
two
or
more
coats
of
arms
upon
one
shield
for
the
purpose
of
indicating
sovereignty
dominion
alliance
descent
or
pretension
according
to
recognised
rules
and
regulations
by
the
employment
of
which
the
story
of
any
given
achievement
shall
be
readily
translatable
the
methods
of
marshalling
are
dimidiation
impalement
quartering
superimposition
instances
of
quartered
shields
are
to
be
met
with
possibly
before
impalements
or
dimidiation
the
earliest
attempt
at
anything
like
a
regularised
method
of
procedure
to
signify
marriage
was
that
usually
males
the
arms
of
their
wives
or
ancestresses
from
whom
they
acquired
their
lands
whilst
impaled
coats
were
to
all
intents
and
purposes
the
armorial
bearings
of
married
women
or
more
frequently
of
widows
who
took
an
immediate
interest
in
their
husbands
property
this
ancient
usage
brings
home
very
forcibly
the
former
territorial
connection
of
arms
and
land
the
practice
of
the
husband
impaling
the
wife
arms
whether
heiress
or
not
probably
arose
near
the
close
of
the
fifteenth
century
even
now
it
is
laid
down
that
the
arms
of
a
wife
should
not
in
general
be
borne
upon
the
husband
banner
surcoat
or
official
seal
but
impalement
as
we
now
know
it
was
preceded
by
dimidiation
dimidiation
which
was
but
a
method
was
effected
by
the
division
of
the
shield
down
the
centre
on
the
dexter
side
was
placed
the
dexter
half
of
the
husband
arms
and
on
the
sinister
side
was
placed
the
sinister
half
of
the
wife
arms
with
some
coats
of
arms
no
objection
could
be
urged
against
the
employment
of
this
method
but
it
was
liable
to
result
with
two
coats
of
arms
having
the
same
ordinary
in
the
creation
of
a
design
which
looked
far
more
like
one
simple
coat
than
a
conjunction
of
two
the
dimidiation
of
argent
a
bend
gules
and
argent
a
chevron
sable
would
simply
result
in
a
single
coat
argent
a
bend
per
pale
gules
and
sable
this
fault
of
the
system
must
have
made
itself
manifest
at
an
early
period
for
we
soon
find
it
became
customary
to
introduce
about
of
the
design
of
each
coat
for
the
sake
of
demonstrating
their
separate
character
it
must
soon
thereafter
have
become
apparent
that
if
of
the
design
of
a
coat
of
arms
could
be
squeezed
into
half
of
the
shield
there
was
no
valid
reason
why
the
whole
of
the
design
could
not
be
employed
this
therefore
became
customary
under
the
name
of
impalement
and
the
practice
has
ever
since
remained
with
us
few
examples
indeed
of
dimidiation
are
to
be
met
with
and
as
a
practical
method
of
conjunction
the
practice
was
chiefly
in
vogue
during
the
earlier
part
of
the
fourteenth
century
occasionally
quartered
coats
were
dimidiated
in
which
case
the
first
and
third
quarters
of
the
husband
coat
were
conjoined
with
the
second
and
fourth
of
the
wife
as
far
as
outward
appearance
went
this
practice
resulted
in
the
fact
that
no
distinction
existed
from
a
plain
quartered
coat
thus
the
seal
of
margaret
of
bavaria
countess
of
holland
and
wife
of
john
count
de
nevers
in
afterwards
duke
of
burgundy
bears
a
shield
on
which
is
apparently
a
simple
instance
of
quartering
but
really
a
dimidiated
coat
the
two
coats
to
the
dexter
side
of
the
palar
line
are
in
chief
a
bordure
compony
argent
and
gules
and
in
base
on
the
sinister
side
the
coat
in
chief
is
bavaria
argent
and
azure
and
the
one
in
base
contains
the
quartered
arms
of
flanders
or
a
lion
rampant
sable
and
holland
or
a
lion
rampant
gules
the
lines
dividing
these
latter
quarters
being
omitted
as
is
usually
found
to
be
the
case
with
this
particular
shield
certain
examples
can
be
found
amongst
the
royal
arms
in
england
which
show
much
earlier
instances
of
dimidiation
the
arms
of
margaret
of
france
who
died
in
the
second
queen
of
edward
as
they
remain
on
her
tomb
in
westminster
abbey
afford
an
example
of
this
method
of
conjunction
the
arms
of
england
appear
on
the
dexter
side
of
the
escocheon
and
this
coat
undergoes
a
certain
amount
of
curtailment
though
the
dimidiation
is
not
complete
portions
only
of
the
hindmost
parts
of
the
lions
being
cut
off
by
the
palar
line
the
coat
of
france
on
the
sinister
side
of
course
does
not
readily
indicate
the
dimidiation
boutell
in
his
chapter
on
marshalling
in
heraldry
historical
and
popular
gives
several
early
examples
of
dimidiation
the
seal
of
edmond
plantagenet
earl
of
cornwall
bears
his
arms
those
of
richard
earl
of
cornwall
and
king
of
the
romans
dimidiating
those
of
his
wife
margaret
de
clare
here
only
the
sinister
half
of
his
bordure
is
removed
while
the
clare
coat
or
three
chevrons
gules
is
entirely
dimidiated
and
the
chevrons
are
little
distinguishable
from
bends
both
coats
are
dimidiated
in
other
examples
mentioned
by
boutell
viz
william
de
valence
and
his
wife
and
alianore
montendre
and
her
husband
guy
ferre
on
the
seal
of
margaret
campbell
wife
of
alexander
napier
in
the
shield
shows
upon
the
dexter
side
the
arms
of
lennox
and
on
the
sinister
the
dimidiated
coat
the
sinister
half
of
the
quartered
arms
of
campbell
and
lorn
this
results
in
the
galley
of
lorn
being
in
chief
and
the
campbell
gyrons
in
base
an
early
and
interesting
irish
example
of
this
kind
of
marshalling
is
afforded
by
a
dimidiated
coat
of
clare
and
fitzgerald
which
now
figures
on
the
official
seal
of
the
provosts
of
youghal
clare
or
three
chevrons
gules
fitzgerald
argent
a
saltire
gules
with
a
label
of
five
points
in
chief
both
these
coats
are
halved
they
result
from
the
marriage
of
richard
clare
earl
of
hertford
with
juliana
daughter
and
heir
of
maurice
fitzgerald
feudal
lord
of
inchiquin
and
youghal
an
even
more
curious
case
of
dimidiation
comes
to
light
in
the
arms
formerly
used
by
the
abbey
of
etienne
at
caen
in
which
the
arms
of
england
and
those
attributed
to
the
duchy
of
normandy
gules
two
lions
passant
guardant
or
were
dimidiated
so
that
in
the
former
half
three
of
the
of
the
lions
appear
while
in
the
sinister
half
only
two
of
the
are
represented
dimidiation
was
not
always
effected
by
conjunction
down
the
palar
line
other
partition
lines
of
the
shield
being
occasionally
though
very
rarely
employed
in
this
manner
certain
curious
now
indivisible
coats
of
arms
remain
which
undoubtedly
originated
in
the
dimidiation
of
two
separate
coats
the
arms
of
yarmouth
sandwich
hastings
rye
and
chester
in
all
cases
some
royal
connection
can
be
traced
which
has
caused
the
royal
arms
of
england
to
be
conjoined
with
the
earlier
devices
of
fish
ships
or
garbs
which
had
been
employed
by
the
towns
in
question
it
is
worth
the
passing
thought
however
whether
the
conjoined
lions
and
hulks
used
by
the
cinque
ports
may
not
originally
have
been
a
device
of
the
sovereign
for
naval
purposes
or
possibly
the
naval
version
of
the
royal
arms
see
page
one
other
remainder
from
the
practice
of
dimidiation
still
survives
amongst
the
presently
existing
rules
of
heraldry
it
is
a
rule
to
which
no
modern
authoritative
exception
can
be
mentioned
when
a
coat
within
a
bordure
is
impaled
with
another
coat
the
bordure
is
not
continued
down
the
centre
of
the
shield
but
stops
short
at
top
and
bottom
when
the
palar
line
is
reached
this
rule
is
undoubtedly
a
result
of
the
ancient
method
of
conjunction
by
dimidiation
but
the
curious
point
is
that
at
the
period
when
dimidiation
was
employed
and
during
the
period
which
followed
some
number
of
examples
can
be
found
where
the
bordure
is
continued
round
the
whole
coat
which
is
within
it
the
arms
of
man
and
wife
are
now
conjoined
according
to
the
following
rules
if
the
wife
is
not
an
heraldic
heiress
the
two
coats
are
impaled
if
the
wife
be
an
heraldic
heir
or
coheir
in
lieu
of
impalement
the
arms
of
her
family
are
placed
on
an
inescutcheon
superimposed
on
the
centre
of
her
husband
arms
the
inescutcheon
being
termed
an
escutcheon
of
pretence
because
she
being
an
heiress
of
her
house
the
husband
pretends
to
the
representation
of
her
family
for
heraldic
purposes
it
therefore
becomes
necessary
to
define
the
terms
heir
and
heiress
it
is
very
essential
that
the
point
should
be
thoroughly
understood
because
quarterings
other
than
those
of
augmentation
can
only
be
inherited
from
or
through
female
ancestors
who
are
in
themselves
heirs
or
coheirs
this
is
the
true
term
or
rather
the
ancient
term
though
they
are
now
usually
referred
to
colloquially
as
heiresses
or
coheiresses
in
blood
or
whose
issue
subsequently
become
in
a
later
generation
the
representatives
of
any
ancestor
in
the
male
line
of
that
female
ancestor
a
woman
is
an
heir
or
heiress
if
she
is
an
only
child
if
all
her
brothers
die
without
leaving
any
issue
to
survive
either
male
or
female
she
becomes
an
heiress
in
her
issue
as
it
is
termed
if
she
die
leaving
issue
herself
if
and
when
all
the
descendants
male
and
female
of
her
brothers
become
absolutely
extinct
the
term
coheir
or
coheiress
is
employed
in
cases
similar
to
the
foregoing
when
instead
of
one
daughter
there
are
two
or
more
no
person
can
be
heir
or
coheir
of
another
person
until
the
latter
is
dead
though
he
or
she
may
be
or
though
the
word
heir
is
frequently
used
with
regard
to
material
matters
such
usage
is
really
there
incorrect
except
in
cases
of
intestacy
a
person
benefiting
under
a
will
is
a
legatee
of
money
or
a
devisee
of
land
and
not
an
heir
to
either
the
table
on
page
may
make
things
a
little
clearer
but
in
the
following
remarks
intestacy
is
ignored
and
the
explanations

been
several
instances
in
recent
years
of
peeresses
in
their
own
right
who
have
married
peers
every
woman
who
a
peerage
must
of
necessity
be
an
heir
or
coheir
and
as
will
have
been
seen
the
laws
of
armory
provide
for
this
circumstance
but
supposing
that
the
peeress
were
a
peeress
by
creation
and
were
not
an
heiress
how
would
her
arms
be
displayed
apparently
it
would
not
be
permissible
to
place
them
on
an
escutcheon
of
pretence
and
consequently
there
is
no
way
upon
the
shield
of
showing
that
his
wife
is
a
peeress
in
her
own
right
such
an
instance
did
arise
in
the
case
of
the
late
baroness
stratheden
who
was
created
a
peeress

not
being
an
heiress
her
husband
was
subsequently
created

how
were
the
arms
of
lord
campbell

lady
stratheden

campbell
displayed
i
think
i
am
correct
in
saying
that
not
a
single
textbook
on
armory
recites
the
method
which
should
be
employed

i
candidly
confess
that
i
myself
am
quite
ignorant
upon
the
point

the

simply
instances
of
how
to
display
the

are
instances
of
the

occur

theory

remains
the
official

being
placed

the
personal

the
laws
of

ecclesiastics
were

the

were
celibate
the
personal
helmet
and

are
placed

coat

in
the
cases

use

impale
the
arms
of
a
wife
upon
the

shield
which
carries
the
impalement
of
an
official
coat
of
arms
because
the
wife
does
not
share
the
office
in
such
a
case
it
is
necessary
to
make
use
of
two
shields
placed
side
by
side
as
is
done
in
conjoining
the
arms
of
a
knight
of
any
order
with
those
of
his
wife
in
impaling
the
arms
of
a
wife
it
is
not
correct
to
impale
more
than
her
pronominal
coat
this
is
a
definite
rule
in
england
somewhat
modified
in
scotland
as
will
be
presently
explained
though
it
has
never
been
considered
good
form
to
impale
a
quartered
shield
it
is
only
recently
that
the
real
fact
that
such
a
proceeding
is
definitely
incorrect
has
come
to
light
it
appears
from
the
state
papers
domestic
series
eliz
xxvi
at
a
chapitre
holden
by
the
office
of
armes
at
the
embroyderers
hall
in
london
anno
reginæ
elizabethæ
it
was
agreed
that
no
inhiritrix
eyther
mayde
wife
or
widow
should
bear
or
cause
to
be
borne
any
creast
or
cognizance
of
her
ancestors
otherwise
than
as
followeth
if
she
be
unmarried
to
bear
in
her
ringe
cognizaunce
or
otherwise
the
first
coate
of
her
ancestors
in
a
lozenge
and
during
her
widowhood
to
set
the
first
coate
of
her
husbande
in
pale
with
the
first
coate
of
her
auncestors
and
if
she
mary
on
who
is
noe
gentleman
then
she
to
be
clearly
exempted
from
the
former
conclusion
whilst
this
rule
holds
in
england
it
must
to
a
certain
extent
be
modified
in
relation
to
the
arms
of
a
scottish
wife
whilst
the
inalienable
right
quarter
arms
from
an
heiress
can
not
be
said
to
be
in
scotland
it
should
be
noted
that
the
custom
of
indiscriminately
quartering
is
much
less
frequent
than
in
england
and
comparatively
seldom
adopted
unless
estates
or
chief
representation
in
an
important
or
appreciable
degree
follow
the
technical
heraldic
representation
in
england
the
claim
is
always
preferred
to
quarter
the
arms
of
an
ancestress
who
had
no
brothers
whether
she
transmitted
estates
or
not
of
course
technically
and
theoretically
the
claim
is
perfectly
correct
and
can
not
and
should
not
be
denied
but
in
practice
in
england
it
has
in
some
cases
reached
a
rather
absurd
extent
when
a
man
on
marrying
an
only
daughter
of
the
youngest
son
of
the
youngest
branch
of
a
family
consequently
acquires
the
right
to
display
with
his
own
ensigns
the
full
arms
and
quarterings
of
the
head
of
a
house
from
which
he
has
inherited
no
lands
and
which
is
still
thriving
in
the
senior
male
line
in
scottish
practice
such
an
event
would
be
ignored
and
in
that
country
it
is
not
usual
to
add
quarterings
to
a
shield
are
these
officially
without
a
rematriculation
of
the
arms
in
england
it
is
merely
a
question
of
recording
the
pedigree
and
proving
heirship
and
many
quarterings
are
proved
and
recorded
that
there
is
not
the
slightest
intention
to
use
regularly
rematriculation
has
a
more
permanent
character
than
mere
registration
inasmuch
as
the
coat
with
its
quarterings
upon
matriculation
as
far
as
usage
is
concerned
becomes
indivisible
and
consequently
for
a
scottish
wife
the
impalement
should
be
of
the
indivisible
arms
and
quarterings
matriculated
to
her
father
in
lyon
register
with
his
bordure
and
other
difference
marks
all
the
old
armorists
provide
ways
of
impaling
the
arms
of
several
wives
and
consequently
the
idea
has
grown
up
that
it
is
permissible
and
correct
to
bear
and
use
the
arms
of
two
wives
at
the
same
time
this
is
a
mistake
because
strictly
and
technically
speaking
the
right
to
impale
the
arms
of
a
wife
ceases
at
her
death
impalement
means
marriage
and
when
the
marriage
is
dissolved
the
impalement
becomes
meaningless
and
should
be
discontinued
a
man
can
not
be
married
to
two
people
at
one
time
nor
can
he
as
a
consequence
impale
two
coats
of
arms
at
the
same
time
the
matter
is
more
clearly
apparent
if
the
question
of
an
escutcheon
of
pretence
be
considered
in
place
of
an
impalement
the
escutcheon
of
pretence
means
that
the
husband
to
represent
the
family
of
his
wife
this
he
undoubtedly
does
whilst
she
is
alive
but
the
moment
she
dies
the
representation
of
her
family
passes
to
her
son
and
heir
and
it
is
ridiculous
for
her
husband
to
to
represent
when
there
is
an
undoubted
representative
in
existence
and
when
the
representation
such
as
it
was
when
vested
in
himself
has
come
to
an
end
and
passed
elsewhere
if
his
had
been
a
peeress
he
would
have
borne
her
escutcheon
of
pretence
surmounted
by
her
coronet
but
it
is
ridiculous
for
him
to
continue
to
do
so
when
the
right
to
the
coronet
and
to
the
peerage
has
passed
to
his
wife
heir
the
same
argument
holds
good
with
regard
to
impalement
that
of
course
raises
the
point
that
in
every
authority
particularly
in
those
of
an
earlier
period
will
be
found
details
of
the
methods
to
be
adopted
for
impaling
the
arms
of
several
wives
people
have
quite
failed
to
appreciate
the
object
of
these
rules
armory
from
its
earliest
introduction
has
had
great
memorial
use
and
when
a
monument
or
hatchment
is
put
up
to
a
man
it
has
been
usual
prior
to
these
utilitarian
days
of
funeral
reform
to
memorialise
the
wives
he
has
been
possessed
of
in
the
same
way
in
a
pedigree
it
is
necessary
to
enumerate
the
names
and
arms
of
all
the
wives
of
a
man
consequently
for
tombs
and
pedigrees
when
all
being
dead
there
is
no
reason
to
indicate
any
particular
woman
as
the
present
plans
have
been
devised
for
the
combination
of
several
coats
into
one
memorial
achievement
plans
necessitated
by
the
circumstances
of
the
cases
and
plans
to
which
no
objection
can
be
taken
tombs
pedigrees
and
other
memorials
are
the
usual
form
in
which
the
records
of
arms
have
chiefly
come
down
to
us
and
from
the
frequency
in
which
cases
of
achievements
with
double
impalements
have
been
preserved
a
mistaken
idea
has
arisen
that
it
is
correct
to
bear
and
actually
use
and
carry
two
impalements
at
one
and
the
same
time
outside
memorial
instances
i
have
utterly
failed
to
find
any
instance
in
former
days
of
a
man
himself
using
in
his
own
lifetime
two
impalements
and
i
believe
and
state
it
to
be
absolutely
incorrect
for
a
man
to
use
say
on
a
carriage
a
bookplate
or
a
seal
the
arms
of
a
deceased
wife
you
may
married
to
a
presently
deceased
woman
therefore
impale
her
arms
in
a
record
or
memorial
but
no
one
married
to
a
deceased
woman
therefore
it
is
wrong
to
advertise
that
you
are
married
to
her
by
impaling
her
arms
and
as
you
can
not
be
married
to
two
people
at
the
same
time
it
is
illogical
and
wrong
to
or
carry
two
impalements
i
know
of
no
instance
of
a
grant
to
a
man
of
arms
to
bear
in
right
of
a
deceased
wife
it
is
for
these
occasions
of
memorial
and
record
that
methods
have
been
devised
to
show
a
man
marriage
with
several
wives
they
certainly
were
not
devised
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
him
to
bear
and
use
for
contemporary
purposes
the
arms
of
a
series
of
dead
women
the
representation
of
whom
is
no
longer
vested
in
himself
whilst
admitting
that
for
the
purposes
of
record
or
memorial
rules
exist
it
should
at
the
same
time
be
pointed
out
that
even
for
such
occasions
it
is
much
more
usual
to
see
two
shields
displayed
each
carrying
its
separate
impalement
than
to
find
two
impalements
on
one
shield
the
use
of
a
separate
shield
for
each
marriage
is
the
method
that
i
would
strongly
advocate
but
as
a
knowledge
of
past
observances
must
be
had
fully
if
one
is
to
read
aright
the
records
of
the
tombs
i
recite
what
the
rules
are
impale
the
arms
of
two
either
the
husband
arms
are
placed
in
the
centre
with
the
first
wife
on
the
dexter
and
the
second
wife
on
the
sinister
or
else
the
husband
arms
are
placed
on
the
dexter
side
and
the
sinister
side
is
divided
in
fess
the
arms
of
the
first
wife
being
placed
in
chief
and
those
of
the
second
in
base
the
former
method
is
the
one
more
generally
employed
of
the
two
husband
arms
in
centre
first
wife
on
dexter
side
second
wife
on
sinister
side
in
chief
and
third
wife
in
base
husband
in
centre
first
and
second
wives
in
chief
and
base
respectively
on
the
dexter
side
and
third
and
fourth
similarly
on
the
sinister
if
one
of
two
wives
be
an
heiress
her
arms
might
be
found
in
pretence
and
the
other
coat
or
coats
impaled
but
it
is
impossible
in
such
a
case
to
place
a
number
to
the
wife
and
it
is
impossible
to
display
an
escutcheon
of
pretence
for
more
than
one
wife
as
if
the
escutcheon
of
pretence
is
removed
from
the
exact
centre
it
at
once
ceases
to
be
an
escutcheon
of
pretence
consequently
if
more
than
one
wife
be
an
heiress
separate
escutcheons
should
be
used
for
each
marriage
plans
have
been
drawn
up
and
apparently
accepted
providing
for
wives
up
to
nearly
twenty
in
number
but
no
useful
purpose
will
be
served
by
repeating
them
a
man
with
more
than
four
wives
is
unusual
in
this
country
divorce
nullifies
marriage
and
both
husband
and
wife
must
at
once
revert
to
bachelor
and
maiden
achievements
respectively
it
is
difficult
to
deduce
any
certain
conclusions
as
to
the
ancient
rules
connected
with
impalement
for
a
simple
reason
which
becomes
very
noticeable
on
an
examination
of
ancient
and
other
armorial
records
in
early
times
there
can
be
no
doubt
whatever
that
men
did
not
impale
or
bother
about
the
arms
of
wives
who
were
not
great
heiresses
a
man
bore
his
own
arms
and
he
left
his
or
his
to
bear
those
of
the
family
with
which
he
had
matched
of
course
we
find
many
cases
in
which
the
arms
of
a
wife
figure
upon
the
husband
shield
but
a
careful
examination
of
them
shows
that
in
practically
every
case
the
reason
is
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
the
wife
was
an
heiress
husbands
were
called
to
parliament
in
virtue
of
the
peerages
vested
in
their
wives
and
we
can
not
but
come
to
the
conclusion
that
whenever
one
finds
use
in
early
times
of
the
arms
of
a
wife
it
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
husband
was
bearing
them
not
because
of
his
mere
marriage
but
because
he
was
enjoying
the
estates
or
peerage
of
his
wife
for
that
reason
we
find
in
many
cases
the
arms
of
the
wife
borne
in
preference
to
the
paternal
arms
of
descent
or
meet
with
them
quartered
with
the
arms
of
the
husband
and
frequently
being
given
precedence
over
his
own
and
on
the
analogy
of
the
coats
of
arms
of
wives
at
present
borne
with
the
wife
surname
by
the
husband
under
royal
licence
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
at
a
period
when
royal
licences
had
not
come
into
regular
vogue
the
same
idea
was
dominant
and
the
appearance
of
a
wife
coat
of
arms
meant
the
assumption
of
those
arms
by
the
husband
as
his
own
with
or
without
the
surname
of
the
wife
the
connection
between
name
and
arms
was
not
then
so
stereotyped
as
it
is
at
present
rather
was
it
a
connection
between
arms
and
land
and
perhaps
more
pointedly
of
arms
and
a
peerage
title
where
this
existed
for
there
are
many
points
and
many
facts
which
conclusively
show
that
at
an
early
period
a
coat
of
arms
was
often
considered
to
have
a
territorial
limitation
or
perhaps
it
should
be
said
that
whilst
admittedly
personal
arms
have
territorial
attributes
or
connection
this
is
borne
out
by
the
pleadings
and
details
remaining
to
us
concerning
the
grey
and
hastings
controversy
and
if
this
territorial
character
of
a
coat
of
arms
is
admitted
together
with
another
characteristic
no
less
important
and
certainly
equally
accepted
that
a
coat
of
arms
could
belong
to
but
one
person
at
the
same
time
it
must
be
recognised
that
the
appearance
of
a
wife
arms
on
a
husband
shield
is
not
an
instance
of
a
sign
of
mere
marriage
or
anything
analogous
thereto
but
when
we
turn
to
the
arms
of
women
the
condition
of
affairs
is
wholly
reversed
a
woman
who
of
course
retained
her
identity
drew
her
position
from
her
marriage
and
from
her
husband
position
and
from
the
very
earliest
period
we
find
that
whilst
a
man
simply
bore
his
own
arms
the
wife
upon
her
seal
displayed
both
the
arms
of
her
own
family
and
the
arms
of
her
husband
until
a
much
later
period
it
can
not
be
said
to
have
been
ordinarily
customary
for
the
husband
to
bear
the
arms
of
his
wife
unless
she
were
an
heiress
but
from
almost
the
beginning
of
armory
the
wife
conjoined
the
arms
of
her
husband
and
herself
but
the
instances
which
have
come
down
to
us
from
an
early
period
of
dimidiated
or
impaled
coats
are
chiefly
instances
of
the
display
of
arms
by
a
widow
the
methods
of
conjunction
which
can
be
classed
as
above
however
at
first
seem
to
have
been
rather
varied
originally
separate
shields
were
employed
for
the
different
coats
of
arms
then
dimidiated
examples
occur
at
a
later
period
we
find
the
arms
impaled
upon
one
shield
and
at
a
subsequent
date
the
escutcheon
of
pretence
comes
into
use
as
a
means
of
indicating
that
the
wife
was
an
heiress
the
origin
of
this
escutcheon
is
easy
to
understand
taking
arms
to
have
a
territorial
limitation
a
point
which
still
finds
a
certain
amount
of
acceptance
in
scottish
heraldry
there
was
no
doubt
that
a
man
in
succeeding
to
a
lordship
in
right
of
his
wife
would
wish
to
bear
the
arms
associated
therewith
he
placed
them
therefore
upon
his
own
and
arms
exclusively
of
a
territorial
character
have
certainly
very
frequently
been
placed
in
pretence
his
own
arms
he
would
look
upon
as
arms
of
descent
they
consequently
occupied
the
field
of
his
shield
the
lordship
of
his
wife
he
did
not
enjoy
through
descent
and
consequently
he
would
naturally
incline
to
place
it
in
pretence
and
from
the
constant
occasions
in
which
such
a
proceeding
would
seem
to
be
the
natural
course
of
events
all
of
which
occasions
would
be
associated
with
an
one
would
be
led
to
the
conclusion
that
such
a
form
of
display
indicated
an
and
consequently
the
rule
deduced
as
are
all
heraldic
rules
from
past
precedents
became
established
in
the
next
generation
the
son
and
heir
would
have
descent
from
his
mother
equally
with
his
father
and
the
arms
of
her
family
would
be
equally
arms
of
descent
to
him
and
no
longer
the
mere
territorial
emblem
of
a
lordship
consequently
they
became
on
the
same
footing
as
the
arms
of
his
father
the
son
would
naturally
therefore
quarter
the
arms
the
escutcheon
of
pretence
being
removed
and
therefore
having
enjoyed
but
a
temporary
existence
the
association
thereof
with
the
becomes
emphasised
in
a
much
greater
degree
this
is
now
accepted
as
a
definite
rule
of
armory
but
in
reciting
it
as
a
rule
it
should
be
pointed
out
first
that
no
man
may
place
the
arms
of
his
wife
upon
an
escutcheon
of
pretence
during
the
lifetime
of
her
father
because
whilst
her
father
is
alive
there
is
always
the
opportunity
of
a
and
of
the
consequent
birth
of
a
son
and
heir
no
man
is
compelled
to
bear
arms
on
an
escutcheon
of
pretence
it
being
quite
correct
to
impale
them
merely
to
indicate
the
marriage
if
he
so
desires
there
are
many
cases
of
arms
which
would
appear
meaningless
and
undecipherable
when
surmounted
by
an
escutcheon
of
pretence
sometimes
also
says
guillim
he
who
marries
an
heretrix
may
carry
her
arms
in
an
inescutcheon
upon
his
own
because
the
husband
pretends
that
his
heirs
shall
one
day
inherit
an
estate
by
her
it
is
therefore
called
an
escutcheon
of
pretence
but
this
way
of
bearing
is
not
known
abroad
upon
that
occasion
a
man
on
marrying
an
has
no
great
space
at
his
disposal
for
the
display
of
her
arms
and
though
it
is
now
considered
perfectly
correct
to
place
any
number
of
quarterings
upon
an
escutcheon
of
pretence
the
opportunity
does
not
in
fact
exist
for
more
than
the
display
of
a
limited
number
in
practice
three
or
four
are
as
many
as
will
usually
be
found
but
theoretically
it
is
correct
to
place
the
whole
of
the
quarterings
to
which
the
wife
is
entitled
upon
the
escutcheon
of
pretence
two
early
english
instances
may
be
pointed
out
in
the
fifteenth
century
in
which
a

placed

these

from

and
albemarle
elected
but
it
was
not
until
about
the
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
that
the
regular
practice
arose
by
which
the
husband
of
an
heiress
places
his
wife
arms
in
an
escutcheon
upon
his
personal
arms
whether
his
coat
be
a
quartered
one
or
not
another
early
instance
is

be
found

we
now
come
to
the
subject
of
quartering
considering
the
fact
that
every
single
on
armory
gives
the
ordinary
rules
for
the
marshalling
of
quarterings
it
is
strange
how
many
mistakes
are
made
and
how
extremely
funny
are
the
ideas
of
some
people
upon
the
subject
of
quartering
as
has
already
been
stated
the
rules
of
quartering
are
governed
by
the
simple
but
essential
and
important
fact
that
every
quartering
exhibited
means
the
representation
in
blood
of
some
particular
person
quarterings
other
than
those
of
augmentation
can
only
be
inherited
from
or
through
those
female
ancestors
who
are
in
themselves
heirs
or
coheirs
in
blood
or
whose
issue
subsequently
become
in
a
later
generation
the
representatives
of
any
ancestor
in
the
male
line
of
that
said
female
ancestor
briefly
speaking
a
woman
is
an
heiress
first
if
she
is
only
child
second
if
all
her
brothers
die
without
issue
in
her
own
lifetime
and
third
if
the
entire
issue
male
and
female
of
her
brothers
becomes
extinct
in
her
own
lifetime
a
woman
becomes
an
heiress
in
her
issue
as
it
is
termed
if
she
die
before
her
brothers
if
and
when
all
the
descendants
of
her
brothers
become
absolutely
extinct
if
the
wife
be
either
an
heir
or
coheir
she
transmits
after
her
death
to
her
children
the
arms
and
quarterings
quarterings
to
add
to
their
paternal
arms
and
as
such
which
she
was
entitled
to
place
upon
her
own
lozenge
the
origin
and
theory
of
quartering
is
as
follows
if
the
daughter
be
an
heiress
or
coheiress
she
represents
either
wholly
or
in
part
her
father
and
his
branch
of
the
family
even
if
his
branch
only
commenced
with
himself
now
in
the
days
when
the
science
of
armory
was
slowly
evolving
itself
there
was
no
married
women
property
act
and
the
husband
became
to
all
intents
and
purposes
possessed
of
and
enjoyed
the
rights
of
his
wife
but
it
was
at
the
same
time
only
a
possession
and
enjoyment
by
courtesy
and
not
an
actual
possession
in
fee
for
the
reversion
remained
with
the
wife
heirs
and
did
not
pass
to
the
heirs
of
the
husband
for
in
cases
where
the
husband
or
wife
had
been
previously
married
or
where
there
was
no
issue
of
their
marriage
their
heirs
would
not
be
identical
of
course
during
the
lifetime
of
his
wife
he
could
not
actually
his
wife
family
and
consequently
could
not
quarter
the
arms
but
in
right
of
his
wife
he
pretended
to
the
representation
of
her
house
and
consequently
the
inescutcheon
of
her
arms
is
termed
an
escutcheon
of
pretence
after
the
death
of
a
wife
her
children
immediately
and
actually
become
the
representatives
of
their
mother
and
are
as
such
of
right
to
quarter
the
arms
of
their
mother
family
the
earliest
example
which
has
been
discovered
at
the
present
time
of
the
use
of
a
quartered
coat
of
arms
is
afforded
by
the
seal
of
joanna
of
ponthieu
second
wife
of
ferdinand
king
of
castile
and
leon
in
this
seal
bears
on
its
reverse
in
a
vesica
the
castles
of
castile
and
the
rampant
lion
of
leon
repeated
as
in
the
modern
quarterings
of
spain
there
is
however
no
separation
of
the
quarters
by
a
line
of
partition
this
peculiarity
will
be
also
noticed
as
existing
in
the
quartered
coats
of
hainault
a
quarter
of
a
century
later
the
quartered
coat
of
castile
and
leon
remains
upon
the
monument
in
westminster

erected
in
memory
of
eleanor
of
castile
who
died
in
the
first
wife
of
edward
i
providing
the
wife
be
an
heiress
and
for
the
remainder
of
this
chapter
which
deals
only
with
quarterings
this
will
be
assumed
the
son
of
a
marriage
the
of
his
mother
quarters
her
arms
with
those
of
his
father
that
is
he
divides
his
shield
into
four
quarters
and
places
the
arms
of
his
father
in
the
first
and
fourth
quarters
and
the
arms
of
his
mother
in
the
second
and
third
that
is
the
root
basis
and
original
rule
of
all
the
rules
of
quartering
but
it
may
be
here
remarked
that
no
man
is
entitled
to
quarter
the
arms
of
his
mother
whilst
she
is
alive
inasmuch
as
she
is
alive
to
represent
herself
and
her
family
and
her
issue
can
not

to
account
for
unless

some

territorial

inherited
from

the
full
identification
of
the
quarterings
borne
by
anthony
lord
rivers
would
probably
help
in
determining
the
point
but
it
should
not
be
imagined
that
the
definite
rules
which
exist
at
the
moment
had
any
such
unalterable
character
in
early
times
husbands
are
found
to
have
quartered
the
arms
of
their
wives
if
they
were
heiresses
and
if
important
lordships
devolved
through
the
marriage
territorial
arms
of
dominion
were
quartered
with
personal
arms
fig
quarterings
of
augmentation
were
granted
and
the
present
system
is
the
endeavour
to
reconcile
all
the
varying
circumstances
and
precedents
which
exist
one
point
however
stands
out
clearly
from
all
ancient
examples
viz
that
quartering
meant
quartering
and
a
shield
was
supposed
to
have
but
four
quarters
upon
it
consequently
we
find
that
instead
of
the
elaborate
schemes
now
in
vogue
showing
or
quarterings
the
shield
had
but
four
and
this
being
admitted
and
recognised
it
became
essential
that
the
four
most
important
should
be
shown
and
consequently
we
find
that
quarterings
were
selected
in
a
manner
which
would
seem
to
us
haphazard
paternal
quarterings
were
dropped
and
the
result
has
been
that
many
coats
of
arms
are
now
known
as
the
arms
of
a
family
with
quite
a
different
surname
from
that
of
the
family
with
which
they
originated
the
matter
was
of
little
consequence
in
the
days
when
the
and
families
were
few
in
number
every
one
knew
how
stafford
derived
his
royal
descent
and
that
it
was
not
male
upon
male
so
no
confusion
resulted
from
the
earls
of
buckingham
giving
the
royal
coat
precedence
before
their
paternal
quartering
of
stafford
see
fig
or
from
their
using
only
the
woodstock
version
of
the
royal
arms
but
as
time
went
on
the
upper
classes
became
more
numerous
ancestors
by
the
succession
of
generations
increased
in
number
and
while
in
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
centuries
it
would
be
a
physical
impossibility
for
any
man
to
have
represented
one
hundred
different
heiresses
of
families
in
later
days
such
became
the
case
the
result
has
been
the
necessity
to
formulate
those
strict
and
rigid
rules
which
for
modern
purposes
must
be
conformed
to
and
it
is
futile
and
childish
to
deduce
a
set
of
rules
from
ancient
and
possibly
isolated
examples
originating
in
and
suitable
for
the
simpler
genealogical
circumstances
of
an
earlier
day
and
assert
that
it
is
equally
permissible
to
adopt
them
at
the
moment
or
to
marshal
a
modern
shield

the

to

away
from
the
four
quarters
of
a
shield
was
the
initiation
of
the
system
of
grand
quarters
see
figs
and
by
this
means
the
relative
importance
could
roughly
be
shown
supposing
a
man
had
inherited
a
shield
of
four
quarters
and
then
married
a
wife
in
whom
was
vested
a
peerage
he
naturally
wished
to
display
the
arms
connected
with
that
peerage
for
these
were
of
greater
importance
than
his
own
four
quarterings
the
problem
was
how
to
introduce
the
fifth
in
some
cases
we
find
it
borne
in
pretence
but
in
other
cases
particularly
in
a
later
generation
we
find
that
important
quarter
given
the
whole
of
a
quarter
of
the
shield
to
itself
the
other
four
being
conjoined
together
and
displayed
so
as
to
occupy
a
similar
space
these
therefore
became
the
system
also
had
advantages
because
it
permitted
coats
which
by
constant
quartering
had
become
indivisible
to
be
perpetuated
in
this
form
so
definite
was
this
rule
that
in
only
one
of
the
series
of
garter
plates
anterior
to
the
tudor
period
is
any
shield
found
containing
more
than
four
quarters
though
many
of
these
are
grand
quarters
containing
other
coats
borne
the
one
instance
which
i
refer
to
as
an
exception
is
the
shield
of
the
duke
and
it
is
quite
possible
that
this
should
not
be
quoted
as
an
instance
in
point
he
appears
to
have
borne
in
the
ordinary
way
four
quarters
but
he
subsequently
added
thereto
two
quarterings
which
may
or
may
not
have
been
one
and
the
same
coat
of
arms
by
way
of
augmentation
these
he
placed
in
pale
in
the
centre
of
the
others
thus
making
the
shield
apparently
one
of
six
quarters

is
safe
in
the
assertion
that
during
the
plantagenet
period
no
more
than
four
quarters
were
ordinarily
placed
upon
a
shield
then
we
come
to
the
brief
period
of
squeezed
in
quarterings
figs
and
in
the
early
visitations
we
get
instances
of
six
eight
and
even
a
larger
number
and
the
start
once
being
made
and
the
number
of
four
relinquished
there
was
of
course
no
reason
why
it
should
not
be
extended
indefinitely
this
appears
to
have
rapidly
become
the
case
and
we
find
that
schemes
of
quarterings
are
now
proved
and
recorded
officially
in
england
and
ireland
some
of
which
exceed
in
number
the
record
number
of
officially
proved
and
recorded
quarterings
is
at
present
held
by
the
family
of
lloyd
of
stockton
in
chirbury
salop
but
many
of
the
quarterings
of
this
family
are
mere
repetition
owing
to
constant
intermarriages
and
to
the
fact
that
a
single
welsh
line
of
male
descent
often
results
in
a
number
of
different
shields
welsh
arms
did
not
originally
have
the
hereditary
unchangeability
we
are
accustomed
to
in
english
heraldry
and
moreover
a
large
proportion
are
later
inventions
borne
to
denote
descent
and
are
not
arms
actually
used
by
those
they
stand
for
so
that
the
recorded
scheme
of
the
quarterings
of
or
of
the
sister
countesses
of
yarborough
and
powis
respectively
baroness
fauconberg
and
conyers
and
baroness
darcy
de
knayth
are
decidedly
more
enviable
nobody
of
course
attempts
to
bear
such
a
number
in
scotland
however
even
to
the
present
day
the
system
of
four
quarterings
is
still
adhered
to
the
result
is
that
in
scotland
the
system
of
grand
quarterings
is
still
pursued
whilst
in
england
it
is
almost
unknown
except
in
cases
where
coats
of
arms
have
for
some
reason
or
another
become
indivisible
this
is
a
very
patent
difficulty
when
it
becomes
necessary
to
marshal
indivisible
scottish
coats
with
english
ones
and
the
system
of
cadency
adopted
in
scotland
which
has
its
chief
characteristic
in
the
employment
of
bordures
makes
the
matter
sometimes
very
far
from
simple
the
system
adopted
at
the
present
time
in
the
case
of
a
royal
licence
for
example
to
bear
a
scottish
name
and
arms
where
the
latter
is
a
coat
of
many
quarterings
within
a
bordure
is
to
treat
such
coat
as
made
indivisible
by
and
according
to
the
most
recent
matriculation
that
coat
is
then
treated
as
a
grand
quartering
of
an
equivalent
value
to
the

inasmuch
as
they
can
only

it
is
always
optional
for
a
man
to
have
arms
assigned
to
him
to
fill
in
any
blanks
which
would
otherwise
mar
his
scheme
of
quarterings
let
us
now
see
how
various
coats
of
arms
are
marshalled
as
quarterings
into
one
achievement
illustration

illustration
fig
illustration
fig
the
original
theory
of
quartering
upon
which
all
rules
are
based
is
that
after
a
marriage
with
an
heiress
necessitating
for
the
children
the
combination
of
the
two
coats
the
shield
is
divided
into
four
quarters
these
four
are
numbered
from
the
top
the
dexter
corner
no
across
towards
the
sinister
no
side
of
the
shield
then
the
next
row
is
numbered
in
the
same
way
nos
and
this
rule
as
to
the
method
of
numbering
holds
good
for
any
number
of
quarterings
in
allocating
the
position
of
the
different
coats
to
their
places
in
the
scheme
of
quarterings
the
pronominal
coat
must
be
in
the
first
quartering
in
a
simple
case
the
exceptions
will
presently
be
referred
to
that
places
the
arms
of
the
father
in
the
first
and
fourth
quarters
and
the
arms
of
the
mother
in
the
second
and
third
such
of
course
being
on
the
assumption
that
the
father
possessed
only
a
simple
coat
without
quarterings
and
that
the
mother
was
in
the
same
position
the
children
therefore
possess
a
coat
of
four
quarters
fig
suppose
a
son
of
theirs
in
his
turn
marries
another
heiress
also
possessing
only
a
simple
coat
without
quarterings
he
bears
arms
as
fig
and
the
grandchildren
descending
from
the
aforesaid
marriage
put
that
coat
in
the
third
quarter
and
the
coat
though
still
of
only
four
quarters
is
and
the
pronominal
coat
the
first
heiress
the
second
fig
if
another
single
quartering
is
brought
in
in
a
later
generation
that
takes
the
place
of
no
so
far
it
is
all
plain
sailing
but
very
few
carry
one
beyond
this
point
another
single
quartering
inherited
gives
five
quarterings
to
be
displayed
on
one
shield
the
usual
plan
is
to
repeat
the
first
quartering
and
gives
you
six
which
are
then
arranged
in
two
rows
of
three
if
the
shield
be
an
impaled
shield
one
sometimes
sees
them
arranged
in
three
rows
of
two
but
this
is
unusual
though
not
incorrect
but
five
quarterings
are
sometimes
arranged
in
two
rows
three
in
the
upper
and
two
in
the
lower
and
with
a
shield
of
the
long
pointed
variety
this
plan
may
be
adopted
with
advantage
subsequent
quarterings
as
they
are
introduced
by
subsequent
marriages
take
their
places
nos
and
so
on
in
arranging
them
on
one
shield
the
order
in
which
they
devolve
according
to
the
and
necessarily
according
to
the
order
in
which
they
are
inherited
must
be
rigidly
adhered
to
but
a
person
is
perfectly
at
liberty
to
repeat
the
quartering
at
the
end
to
make
an
even
number
or
not
at
his
pleasure
but
no
more
than
the
first
quartering
must
be
repeated
in
such
cases
to
arrange
the
quarters
in
any
number
of
rows
he
may
find
most
convenient
according
to
the
shape
of
the
space
the
quarterings
will
occupy
upon
the
continent
it
is
usual
to
specify
the
number
and
position
of
the
lines
by
which
the
shield
is
divided
thus
while
an
english
herald
would
say
simply
of
and
leave
it
to
the
painter
or
taste
to
arrange
the
quarterings
in
three
rows
of
two
or
in
two
rows
of
three
a
french
or
german
herald
would
ordinarily
specify
the
arrangement
to
be
used
in
distinct
terms
if
a
man
possessing
only
a
simple
coat
of
arms
without
quarterings
marry
an
heiress
with
a
number
of
quarterings
say
twenty
he
himself
places
the
arms
and
quarterings
of
his
wife
in
pretence
their
children
eventually
as
a
consequence
inherit
quarterings
the
first
is
the
coat
of
their
father
the
second
is
the
first
coat
of
the
mother
and
the
remaining
nineteen
follow
in
a
regular
sequence
according
to
their
position
upon
their
mother
achievement
to
sum
the
rule
up
it
is
necessary
first
to
take
the
quarterings
inherited
from
the
father
and
arrange
them
in
a
proper
sequence
and
then
follow
on
the
same
with
the
arms
and
quarterings
inherited
from
the
mother
the
foregoing
explanations
should
show
how
generation
by
generation
quarterings
are
added
to
a
paternal
shield
but
i
have
found
that
many
of
those
who
possess
a
knowledge
of
the
laws
to
this
extent
are
yet
at
a
loss
given
a
pedigree
to
marshal
the
resulting
quarterings
in
their
right
order
given
your
pedigree
the
first
quartering
be
pronominal
i
am
here
presuming
no
change
of
name
or
arms
has
occurred
which
is
the
coat
of
the
strict
male
line
of
descent
then
follow
this
male
line
back
as
far
as
it
is
known
the
second
quartering
is
the
coat
of
the
heiress
who
married
your
earliest
ancestor
in
the
male
line
who
is
known
to
have
married
an
heiress
then
after
her
coat
will
follow
all
the
quarterings
which
she
was
entitled
to
and
which
she
has
brought
in
to
your
family
having
exhausted
these
you
then
follow
your
male
line
to
the
next
heiress
adding
her
arms
as
a
quartering
to
those
already
arranged
and
following
it
by
her
quarterings
the
same
plan
must
be
pursued
until
you
arrive
at
your
own
name
upon
the
pedigree
unless
some
exceptional
circumstance
has
arisen
and
such
exceptions
will
presently
be
found
detailed
at
length
all
the
quarterings
are
of
equal
heraldic
value
and
must
be
the
same
size
when
displayed
if
after
having
worked
out
your
quarterings
you
find
that
you
have
more
than
you
care
to
use
you
are
quite
at
liberty
to
make
a
selection
omitting
any
number
it
is
entirely
to
display
quarterings
without
those
quarterings
which
brought
them
into
the
paternal
line
supposing
your
name
to
be
brown
you
put
the
brown
arms
in
the
first
quarter
but
at
your
pleasure
you
can
quarter
the
arms
of
each
single
heiress
who
married
an
ancestor
of
yours
in
the
male
line
who
herself
became
brown
or
you
can
omit
the
whole
or
a
part
but
supposing
one
of
these
brown
smith
was
entitled
to
quarter
the
arms
of
jones
which
arms
of
jones
had
brought
in
the
arms
of
robinson
you
are
not
at
liberty
to
quarter
the
arms
of
jones
without
quartering
smith
and
if
you
wish
to
display
the
arms
of
robinson
you
also
quarter
the
arms
of
jones
to
bring
in
robinson
and
the
arms
of
smith
to
bring
in
robinson
and
jones
to
your
own
brown
achievement
you
can
use
brown
only
or
quarterly
and
brown
and
smith
or
and
brown
smith
jones
or
quarterly
brown
smith
jones
robinson
but
you
are
entitled
to
quarter
and
brown
jones
robinson
because
smith
which
brought
in
jones
and
robinson
has
been
omitted
and
there
was
never
a
match
between
brown
and
jones
quarterings
signifying
nothing
beyond
mere
representation
are
not
compulsory
and
their
use
or
disuse
is
quite
optional
so
much
for
the
general
rules
of
quartering
let
us
now
consider
certain
cases
which
require
rules
to
themselves
it
is
possible
for
a
daughter
to
be
the
sole
heir
or
coheir
of
her
mother
whilst
not
being
the
heir
of
her
father
as
in
the
following
imaginary
pedigree
an
heiress
mary
fauconberg
joan
only
daughter
thomas
henry
heir
of
her
mother
but
not
of
her
father
in
this
case
joan
is
not
the
heir
of
her
father
inasmuch
as
he
has
sons
thomas
and
henry
but
she
is
the
heir
of
her
mother
and
the
only
issue
capable
of
inheriting
and
transmitting
the
conyers
arms
and
quarterings
joan
is
heir
of
her
mother
but
not
of
her
father
the
husband
of
joan
can
either
impale
the
arms
of
darcy
as
having
married
a
daughter
of
john
darcy
or
he
can
place
upon
an
escutcheon
of
pretence
arms
to
indicate
that
he
has
married
the
heiress
of
conyers
but
it
would
be
quite
incorrect
for
him
to
simply
place
conyers
in
pretence
because
he
has
not
married
a
miss
conyers
what
he
must
do
is
to
charge
the
arms
of
conyers
with
a
dexter
canton
of
the
arms
of
darcy
and
place
this
upon
his
escutcheon
of
pretence
the
children
will
quarter
the
arms
of
conyers
with
the
canton
of
darcy
and
inherit
likewise
all
the
quarterings
to

mary
conyers
succeeded
but
the
conyers
arms
must
be
always
thereafter
charged
with
the
arms
of
darcy
on
a
canton
and
no
right
accrues
to
the
darcy
quarterings
the
following
curious
but
quite
genuine
case
which
was
pointed
out
to
me
by
the
late
ulster
king
of
arms
presents
a
set
of
circumstances
absolutely
unique
and
it
still
remains
to
be
decided
what
is
the
correct
method
to
adopt
lady
mary

and
william
lawrence
margaret

coheir

therefore

and

coheir
of

of

or

she
is
therefore
entitled
to
transmit
the
arms
of
bermingham
with
lawrence
on
a
canton
plus
annesley
on
a
canton
married
how
the
arms
of
bermingham
are
to
be
charged
with
both
lawrence
and
annesley
remains
to
be
seen
i
believe
ulster
favoured
two
separate
cantons
dexter
and
sinister
respectively
but
the
point
did
not
come
before
him
officially
and
i
know
of
no
official
decision
which
affords
a
precedent
the
reverse
of
the
foregoing
affords
another
curious
point
when
a
woman
is
the
heir
of
her
father
but
not
the
heir
of
her
mother
john
jones
john
williams
ethel
smith
henry
roberts
only
child
and
heir
alice
williams
arthur
ellis
edward
roberts
only
child
and
heir
of
his
mother
heir
of
john
williams
issue
theodore
ellis
who
claims
to
quarter
and
ellis
williams
smith
it
is
officially
admitted
see
the
introduction
to
burke
general
armory
that
the
claim
is
accurately
made
the
process
of
reasoning
is
probably
thus
john
williams
places
upon
an
escutcheon
of
pretence
the
arms
of
smith
and
alice
williams
succeeds
in
her
own
right
to
the
arms
of
her
mother
because
the
latter
was
an
heiress
and
for
herself
is
entitled
to
bear
as
would
a
son
the
arms
of
the
two
parents
quarterly
and
having
so
inherited
alice
williams
being
herself
an
heiress
is
entitled
to
transmit
at
any
rate
arthur
ellis
is
entitled
to
impale
or
place
upon
his
escutcheon
of
pretence
williams
and
smith
quarterly
to
admit
the
right
for
the
descendants
to
quarter
the
arms
arthur
ellis
so
bore
is
no
more
than
a
logical
progression
but
the
eventual
result
appears
faulty
because
we
find
theodore
ellis
quartering
the
arms
of
smith
whilst
the
representation
of
smith
is
in
the
line
of
edward
roberts
this
curious
set
of
circumstances
however
is
rare
in
the
extreme
it
frequently
happens
in
devising
a
scheme
of
quarterings
that
a
person
may
represent
heiresses
of
several
families
entitled
to
bear
arms
but
to
whom
the
pedigree
must
be
traced
through
an
heiress
of
another
family
which
did
not
possess
arms
consequently
any
claim
to
quarterings
inherited
through
the
heiress
is
dormant
and
the
quarterings
must
not
be
used
or
inserted
in
any
scheme
drawn
up
it
is
always
permissible
however
to
petition
for
arms
to
be
granted
to
be
borne
for
that
family
for
the
purpose
of
introducing
the
quarterings
in
question
and
such
a
grant
having
been
made
the
dormant
claim
then
becomes
operative
and
the
new
coat
is
introduced
followed
by
the
dormant
quartering
in
precisely
the
same
manner
as
would
have
been
the
case
if
the
arms
granted
had
always
existed
grants
of
this
character
are
constantly
being
obtained
when
a
royal
licence
to
assume
or
change
name
and
arms
is
granted
it
very
considerably
affects
the
question
of
quartering
and
many
varying
circumstances
attending
these
royal
licences
make
the
matter
somewhat
intricate
if
the
royal
licence
is
to
assume
a
name
and
arms
in
lieu
of
those
previously
used
this
means
that
for
everyday
use
the
arms
are
the
right
to
the
old
arms
lapsing
except
for
the
purpose
of
a
scheme
of
quarterings
the
new
coat
of
arms
under
the
terms
of
the
royal
licence
which
requires
it
first
to
be
exemplified
in
our
royal
college
of
arms
otherwise
this
our
royal
licence
to
be
void
and
of
none
effect
is
always
so
exemplified
this
exemplification
being
from
the
legal
point
of
view
equivalent
to
a
new
grant
of
the
arms
to
the
person
assuming
them
the
terms
of
the
royal
licence
have
always
carefully
to
be
borne
in
mind
particularly
in
the
matter
of
remainder
because
sometimes
these
exemplifications
are
for
a
limited
period
or
intended
to
devolve
with
specified
property
and
a
royal
licence
only
nullifies
a
prior
right
to
arms
to
the
extent
of
the
terms
recited
in
the
letters
patent
of
exemplification
in
the
ordinary
way
however
such
an
exemplification
is
equivalent
to
a
new
grant
affecting
all
the
descendants
when
it
is
assumed
in
lieu
for
the
ordinary
purpose
of
use
the
new
coat
of
arms
takes
the
place
of
the
old
one
but
the
right
to
the
old
one
remains
in
theory
to
a
certain
extent
inasmuch
as
its
existence
in
any
scheme
of
quartering
bring
any
quarterings
previously
inherited
and
these
can
not
be
displayed
with
the
new
coat
unless
they
are
preceded
by
the
old
one
quarterings
however
which
are
brought
into
the
family
through
a
marriage
in
the
generation
in
which
the
royal
licence
is
obtained
or
in
a
subsequent
generation
can
be
displayed
with
the
new
coat
without
the
interposition
of
the
old
one
if
the
royal
licence
be
to
bear
the
name
of
a
certain
family
in
lieu
of
a
present
name
and
to
bear
the
arms
of
that
family
quarterly
with
the
arms
previously
borne
the
quarterly
coat
is
then
exemplified
in
an
english
or
irish
royal
licence
the
coat
of
arms
for
the
name
assumed
is
placed
in
the
first
and
the
fourth
quarters
and
the
old
paternal
arms
figure
in
the
second
and
third
this
is
an
invariable
rule
the
quarterly
coat
thus
exemplified
becomes
an
indivisible
coat
for
the
new
name
and
it
is
not
permissible
to
subsequently
divide
these
quarterings
they
become
as
much
one
coat
of
arms
as
azure
a
bend
or
is
the
coat
of
arms
of
scrope
if
this
quarterly
coat
is
to
be
introduced
in
any
scheme
of
quarterings
it
will
only
occupy
the
same
space
as
any
other
single
quartering
and
counts
only
as
one
though
it
of
course
is
in
reality
a
grand
quartering
in
devising
a
scheme
of
quarterings
for
which
a
coat
of
this
character
exemplified
under
a
royal
licence
is
the
pronominal
coat
that
quarterly
coat
is
placed
in
the
first
quarter
next
to
it
is
placed
the
original
coat
of
arms
borne
as
the
pronominal
coat
before
the
royal
licence
and
exemplified
in
the
second
and
third
of
the
first
quarter
when
here
repeated
it
occupies
an
entire
quarter
next
to
it
are
placed
the
whole
of
the
quarterings
belonging
to
the
family
in
the
order
in
which
they
occur
if
the
family
whose
name
has
been
assumed
is
represented
through
an
heiress
that
coat
of
arms
is
also
repeated
in
its
proper
position
and
in
that
place
in
which
it
would
have
appeared
if
unaffected
by
the
royal
licence
but
if
it
be
the
coat
of
arms
of
a
family
from
whom
there
is
no
descent
or
of
whom
there
is
no
representation
the
fact
of
the
royal
licence
does
not
give
any
further
right
to
quarter
it
beyond
its
appearance
in
the
pronominal
grand
quartering
the
exact
state
of
the
case
is
perhaps
best
illustrated
by
the
arms
of
the
name
of
the
family
was
originally
reid
and
representing
an
heiress
of
the
cuddons
of
shaddingfield
hall
they
obtained
a
royal
licence
to
take
the
name
and
arms
of
cuddon
in
addition
to
the
name
and
arms
of
reid
becoming
thereafter
the
arms
were
exemplified
in
due
course
and
the
achievement
then
became
quarterly
and
the
arms
of
reid
the
arms
of
cuddon
in
scotland
no
such
thing
as
a
royal
licence
exists
the
matter
being
determined
merely
by
a
rematriculation
following
upon
a
voluntary
change
of
name
there
is
no
specified
order
or
position
for
the
arms
of
the
different
names
and
the
arrangement
of
the
various
quarterings
is
left
to
be
determined
by
the
circumstances
of
the
case
thus
in
the
arms
of
the
arms
of
anstruther
are
in
the
first
quarter
and
the
matter
is
always
largely
governed
by
the
importance
of
the
respective
estates
and
the
respective
families
in
england
this
is
not
the
case
because
it
is
an
unalterable
rule
that
the
arms
of
the
last
or
principal
surname
if
there
be
two
or
the
arms
of
the
one
surname
if
that
be
the
case
when
the
arms
of
two
families
are
quartered
must
always
go
in
the
and
quarters
if
three
names
are
assumed
by
royal
licence
the
arms
of
the
last
name
go
in
the
and
quarters
and
the
last
name
but
one
in
the
second
quarter
and
of
the
first
name
in
the
third
these
cases
are
however
rare
but
no
matter
how
many
names
are
assumed
and
no
matter
how
many
original
coats
of
arms
the
shield
as
exemplified
consists
of
it
thereafter
becomes
an
indivisible
coat
when
a
royal
licence
is
issued
to
an
illegitimate
person
to
bear
the
name
and
arms
of
another
family
no
right
is
conferred
to
bear
the
quarterings
of
that
family
even
subject
to
difference
marks
the
royal
licence
is
only
applicable
to
whatever
arms
were
the
pronominal
coat
used
with
the
name
assumed
though
instances
certainly
can
be
found
in
some
of
the
visitation
books
and
other
ancient
records
of
a
coat
with
quarterings
the
whole
debruised
by
a
bendlet
sinister
notably
in
the
case
of
a
family
of
talbot
where
eight
quarters
are
so
marked
the
fact
remains
that
this
practice
has
long
been
definitely
considered
incorrect
and
is
now
never
permitted
if
a
royal
licence
is
issued
to
an
illegitimate
woman
the
exemplification
is
to
herself
personally
for
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
she
has
no
relatives
and
though
she
may
be
one
of
a
large
family
her
descendants
are
entitled
to
quarter
the
arms
with
the
marks
of
distinction
exemplified
to
her
because
such
quartering
merely
indicates
the
representation
of
that
one
woman
who
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
stands
alone
and
without
relatives
in
the
case
of
a
royal
licence
to
take
a
name
and
arms
subject
to
these
marks
of
distinction
for
illegitimacy
and
in
cases
where
the
arms
to
be
assumed
are
a
coat
the
mark
of
distinction
which
in
england
is
now
invariably
a
bordure
wavy
will
surround
both
quarterings
which
remain
an
indivisible
coat
if
an
augmentation
is
granted
to
a
person
whose
pronominal
coat
is
that
augmentation
whatever
form
it
may
assume
is
superimposed
upon
all
quarterings
thus
a
chief
of
augmentation
would
go
across
the
top
of
the
shield
the
four
quarters
being
displayed
below
and
the
whole
of
this
shield
would
be
only
one
quartering
in
any
scheme
of
quartering
an
inescutcheon
is
superimposed
over
all
if
the
augmentation
take
the
form
of
a
quartering
then
the
pronominal
coat
is
a
grand
quartering
equivalent
in
size
to
the
augmentation
if
a
person
entitled
to
a
coat
and
a
double
name
obtains
a
royal
licence
to
bear
another
name
and
arms
and
to
bear
the
arms
he
has
previously
borne
quarterly
with
those
he
has
assumed
the
result
would
be
quarterly
and
the
new
coat
assumed
quarterly
and
the
arms
he
has
previously
borne
but
it
should
be
noticed
that
the
arrangements
of
coats
of
arms
under
a
royal
licence
largely
depends
upon
the
wording
of
the
document
by
which
authority
is
given
by
the
sovereign
the
wording
of
the
document
in
its
terms
is
based
upon
the
wording
of
the
petition
and
within
reasonable
limits
any
arrangement
which
is
desired
is
usually
permitted
so
that
care
should
be
taken
as
to
the
wording
of
the
petition
a
quartering
of
augmentation
is
always
placed
in
the
first
quarter
of
a
shield
but
it
becomes
indivisible
from
and
is
depicted
with
the
paternal
arms
for
instance
the
dukes
of
westminster
for
the
time
being
but
not
other
members
of
the
family
bear
as
an
augmentation
the
arms
of
the
city
of
westminster
in
the
and
quarters
of
his
shield
and
the
arms
of
grosvenor
in
the
and
but
this
coat
of
westminster
and
grosvenor
is
an
indivisible
quarterly
coat
which
together
would
only
occupy
the
first
quarter
in
a
shield
of
quarterings
then
the
second
one
would
be
the
arms
of
grosvenor
alone
which
would
be
followed
by
the
quarterings
previously
inherited
if
under
a
royal
licence
a
name
is
assumed
and
the
royal
licence
makes
no
reference
to
the
arms
of
the
family
the
arms
for
all
purposes
remain
unchanged
and
as
if
no
royal
licence
had
ever
been
issued
if
the
royal
licence
issued
to
a
family
simply
exemplifies
a
single
coat
of
arms
it
is
quite
wrong
to
introduce
any
other
coat
of
arms
to
convert
this
single
coat
into
a
one
to
all
intents
and
purposes
it
may
be
stated
that
in
scotland
there
are
still
only
four
quarters
in
a
shield
and
if
more
than
four
coats
are
introduced
grand
quarterings
are
employed
grand
quarterings
are
very
frequent
in
scottish
armory
the
scottish
rules
of
quartering
follow
no
fixed
principle
and
the
constant
rematriculations
make
it
impossible
to
deduce
exact
rules
and
though
roughly
approximating
to
the
english
ones
no
greater
generalisation
can
be
laid
down
than
the
assertion
that
the
most
recent
matriculation
of
an
ancestor
governs
the
arms
and
quarterings
to
be
displayed
a
royal
quartering
is
never
subdivided
in
combining
scottish
and
english
coats
of
arms
into
one
scheme
of
quartering
it
is
usual
if
possible
to
treat
the
coat
of
arms
as
matriculated
in
scotland
as
a
grand
quartering
equivalent
in
value
to
any
other
of
the
english
quarterings
this
however
is
not
always
possible
in
cases
where
the
matriculation
itself
creates
grand
quarterings
and
and
for
a
scheme
of
quarterings
in
such
a
case
it
is
more
usual
for
the
scottish
matriculation
to
be
divided
up
into
its
component
parts
and
for
these
to
be
used
as
simple
quarterings
in
succession
to
the
english
ones
regardless
of
any
bordure
which
may
exist
in
the
scottish
matriculation
it
can
not
of
course
be
said
that
such
a
practice
is
beyond
criticism
though
it
frequently
remains
the
only
practical
way
of
solving
the
difficulty
until
comparatively
recent
times
if
amongst
quarterings
inherited
the
royal
arms
were
included
it
was
considered
a
fixed
unalterable
rule
that
these
should
be
placed
in
the
first
quarter
taking
precedence
of
the
pronominal
coat
irrespective
of
their
real
position
according
to
the
date
or
pedigree
place
of
introduction
this
rule
however
has
long
since
been
superseded
and
royal
quarterings
now
take
their
position
on
the
same
footing
as
the
others
it
very
probably
arose
from
the
misconception
of
the
facts
concerning
an
important
case
which
doubtless
was
considered
a
precedent
the
family
of
mowbray
after
their
marriage
with
the
heiress
of
thomas
de
brotherton
used
either
the
arms
of
brotherton
alone
these
being
england
differenced
by
a
label
or
else
placed
them
in
the
first
quarter
of
their
shield
consequently
from
this
precedent
a
rule
was
deduced
that
it
was
permissible
and
correct
to
give
a
royal
quartering
precedence
over
all
others
the
position
of
the
mowbrays
dukes
of
norfolk
as
earls
marshal
no
doubt
led
to
their
own
achievement
being
considered
an
exemplary
model
but
it
appears
to
have
been
overlooked
that
the
mowbrays
bore
these
royal
arms
of
brotherton
not
as
an
inherited
quartering
but
as
a
grant
to
themselves
richard
ii
apparently
granted
them
permission
to
bear
the
arms
of
edward
the
confessor
impaled
with
the
arms
of
brotherton
the
whole
between
the
two
royal
ostrich
feathers
fig
and
consequently
the
grant
having
been
made
the
mowbrays
were
under
no
necessity
to
display
the
mowbray
or
the
segrave
arms
to
bring
in
the
arms
of
brotherton
a
little
later
a
similar
case
occurred
with
the
stafford
family
who
became
sole
of
thomas
of
woodstock
and
consequently
entitled
to
bear
his
arms
as
a
quartering
the
matter
appears
to
have
been
settled
at
a
chapter
of
the
college
of
arms
and
the
decision
arrived
at
was
as

at

this
period
can
be
alluded
to

though
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
rule
existed
at
one

long

a
singular
instance
of
a
very
exceptional
method
of

in
the
case
of
the
arms
of
the

the

not
by
the
engrailed

by
a

placed

as
a
mark
of
cadency
they
surrounded
the
main
escutcheon
with
a

or
and
gules
this
arrangement
was
doubtless
suggested
by
the
royal
arms
of
denmark
the
quarterings
of
which
have
been
for
so
many
centuries

separate
the
quarters
of
their
frequently
complicated
coats
the
quarterings
in
these
cases
are
often
not
indicative
of
descent
from
different
families
but
were
all
included
in
the
original
grant
of

centre
of
the
cross

escutcheon

is
very
frequently
placed
the
main
difference
between
british
and
foreign
usage
with
regard
to
quartering
is
this
that
in
england
quarterings
are
usually
employed
to
denote
simply
descent
from
an
heiress
or
representation
in
blood
in
scotland
they
also
implied
the
possession
of
lordships
in
foreign
coats
the
quarterings
are
often
employed
to
denote
the
possession
of
fiefs
acquired
in
other
ways
than
by
marriage
by
bequest
or
purchase
or
the
the
right
of
succession
to
such
fiefs
in
accordance
with
certain
agreements
in
foreign
heraldry
the
base
of
the
quartered
shield
is
not
unfrequently
cut
off
by
a
horizontal
line
forming
what
is
known
as
a
and
the
space
thus
made
is
occupied
by
one
or
more
coats
at
other
times
a
pile
with
curved
sides
runs
from
the
base
some
distance
into
the
quartered
shield
which
is
then
said
to
be
en
and
this
space
is
devoted
to
the
display
of
one
or
more
quarterings
the
definite
and
precise
british
regulations
which
have
grown
up
on
the
subject
of
the
marshalling
of
arms
have
no
equivalent
in
the
armorial
laws
of
other
countries
very
rarely
quartering
is
affected
as
in
the
arms
of
sicily
and
in
a
few
coats
of
spanish
origin
but
even
as
regards
foreign
armory
the
practice
is
so
rare
that
it
may
be
disregarded
the
laws
of
marshalling
upon
the
continent
and
particularly
in
germany
are
very
far
from
being
identical
with
british
heraldic
practices

not
quite
identical
with
that
which
we
term
accollé

and
this
is
a
peculiarity
practically
unknown
in
england
the
german
practice
invariably
reverses
the
charges
upon
the
dexter
shield
so
that
the
charges
upon
the
two
shields
respect
each
other
this
perhaps
can
be
most
readily
understood
by
reference
to
figs

it
should
be
noted
that
letters

words
if

are
not

this
reversing
of
the
charges
is
by
no
means
an
uncommon
practice
in
germany
for
other
purposes
for
instance
if
the
arms
of
a
state
are
depicted
surrounded
by
the
arms
of
provinces
or
if
the
arms
of
a
reigning
sovereign
are
grouped
within
a
bordure
of
the
shields
of
other
people
the
charges
on
the
shields
to
the
dexter
are
almost
invariably
shown
in
reflection
regarding
the
shield
in
the
centre
this
practice
resting
only
on
what
may
be
termed
heraldic
courtesy
dates
back
to
very
early
times
and
is
met
with
even
in
rolls
of
arms
where
the
shields
are
all
turned
to
face
the
centre
such
a
system
was
adopted
in
siebmacher
book
of
arms
but
what
the
true
position
of
the
charges
should
be
when
represented
upon
a
simple
shield
should
be
determined
by
the
position
of
the
helmet
it
may
be
of
interest
to
state
that
in
george
chapel
at
windsor
the
early
stall
plates
as
originally
set
up
were
all
disposed
so
that
helmets
and
charges
alike
faced

a
greater
weight
in
marshalling
than
the
principle
of
heirship
which
is
now
practically
the
sole
governing
factor
in
british
heraldry

must
therefore
content
oneself
with
a
brief
recital
of
some
of
the
various
modes
of
conjunction
which
have
been

are
still
practised
these
include
impalement
per

per

fig

dimidiation

is
more
usual
on
the
continent
than
it
ever
was
in
these
kingdoms
the
subdivision
of
the
field
as
with
ourselves
is
most
frequently
adopted
though
we
are
usually
confined
to
quartering
german
armory
knows
no
such
restrictions
the
most
usual
subdivisions
are
as
given
in

represents
the

his

are
quartered
with
the
impersonal
arms
of

a
cross

another
method
of
conjunction
is
superimposition
by
which
the
design
of
the
one
shield
takes
the
form
of
an
ordinary
imposed
upon
the

curious
method
of
conjoining

been
already

of
the
widespread

obtains

the

the
german

can
best
be
explained
by
two

us
suppose
a
coat

duplicate
the
charges

points

still
less

of

the

alone
would
make
a
bulky
volume
but
it
is
necessary
to
treat
of
the
matter
to
some
limited
extent
inasmuch
as
in
modern
heraldry
in
every
country
in
europe
additions
are
made
to
the
armorial
achievement
whenever
it
is
desired
to
signify
rank
in
any
of
the
orders
of
knighthood
though
a
large
number
of
the
early
plantagenet
garter
stall
plates
date
as
far
back
as
the
year
it
is
evident
that
nothing
in
the
armorial
bearings
with
which
they
are
emblazoned
bears
any
relation
to
the
order
of
knighthood
to
which
they
belonged
until
the
year
or
thereabouts
when
charles
the
bold
duke
of
burgundy
was
elected
a
knight
of
the
garter
his
stall
plate
which
is
of
a
very
exceptional
style
and
character
is
the
first
to
bear
the
garter
encircling
the
shield
it
is
curious
to
notice
by
the
way
that
upon
the
privy
seal
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
which
shows
the
same
arms
depicted
upon
his
garter
plate
the
shield
is
surrounded
by
the
collar
from
which
depends
the
badge
of
the
order
of
the
golden
fleece
so
that
it
is
highly
probable
that
the
custom
of
adding
marks
of
knighthood
to
a
shield
came
to
us
from
the
continent
the
next
garter
plate
which
shows
the
garter
around
the
shield
is
that
of
viscount
lovel
who
was
elected
in
and
the
shield
of
the
earl
of
derby
who
was
elected
in
the
same
year
also
is
encircled
by
the
garter
the
garter
itself
encircling
the
shields
of
knights
of
that
order
remained
the
only
mark
of
knighthood
used
armorially
in
this
country
for
a
considerable
period
though
we
find
that
the
example
was
copied
in
scotland
soon
afterwards
with
regard
to
the
order
of
the
thistle
at
the
commencement
of
the
present
lyon
register
which
dates
from
the
year
the
arms
of
the
king
of
scotland
which
are
given
as
such
and
not
as
the
king
of
england
and
scotland
are
described
as
encircled
by
the
collar
of
the
order
of
the
thistle
this
probably
was
used
as
the
equivalent
of
the
garter
in
england
for
we
do
not
find
the
collar
of
the
garter
together
with
the
garter
itself
or
the
ribbon
circle
of
the
thistle
together
with
the
collar
of
that
order
until
a
much
later
period
the
use
of
collars
of
knighthood
upon
the
continent
to
encircle
coats
of
arms
has
been
from
the
fifteenth
century
very
general
and
extensive
examples
are
to
be
found
at
an
earlier
date
but
the
encircling
of
arms
with
the
garter
carrying
the
motto
of
the
order
or
with
the
ribbon
which
is
termed
the
circle
and
motto
of
any
other
order
is
an
entirely
english
practice
which
does
not
appear
to
have
been
copied
in
any
other
country
it
of
course
arose
from
the
fact
that
the
actual
garter
as
worn
by
the
knight
of
the
order
carried
the
motto
of
the
order
and
that
by
representing
the
garter
round
the
shield
the
motto
of
the
order
was
of
necessity
also
added
the
lyon
register
however
in
the
entry
of
record
dated
states
that
the
shield
is
encircled
with
the
order
of
scotland
the
same
being
composed
of
rue
and
thistles
having
the
image
of
andrew
with
his
crosse
on
his
brest
pendent
and
it
is
by
no
means
improbable
that
occasional
instances
of
the
heraldic
use
of
the
collar
of
the
garter
might
be
discovered
at
the
same
period
but
it
is
not
until
the
later
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
that
it
obtained
anything
like
a
regular
use
during
the
hanoverian
period
it
became
customary
to
encircle
the
shield
first
with
the
garter
and
that
in
its
turn
with
the
collar
of
the
order
whenever
it
was
desired
to
display
the
achievement
in
its
most
complete
style
and
though
even
then
as
at
the
present
day
for
less
elaborate
representations
the
garter
only
was
used
without
the
collar
it
still
remains
correct
to
display
both
in
a
full
emblazonment
of
the
arms
an
impetus
to
the
practice
was
doubtless
given
by
the
subdivision
of
the
order
of
the
bath
which
will
be
presently
referred
to
in
speaking
of
the
garter
the
opportunity
should
be
taken
to
protest
strongly
against
the
objectionable
practice
which
has
arisen
of
using
a
garter
to
encircle
a
crest
or
shield
and
to
carry
the
family
motto
no
matter
what
motto
is
placed
upon
the
garter
it
is
both
bad
form
and
absolutely
incorrect
for
any
one
who
is
not
a
knight
of
the
garter
to
use
a
garter
in
any
heraldic
display
but
to
tabulate
the
existing
practice
the
present
rules
as
to
the
display
of
the
arms
of

the
different
orders

anciently
the
motto
was
spelled

as
may
be
noticed
from
some
of
the
early
garter
plates
and
the
style
of
the
letter
was
what
is
now
known
as
old
english
the
garter
is
worn
buckled
with
the
end
tucked
under
and
looped
in
a
specified
manner
which
is
the
method
also
adopted
in
heraldic
representations
it
is
quite
permissible
to
use
the
garter
alone
but
a
knight
of
the
order
is
allowed
to
add
outside
the
garter
the
representation
of
the

of

a
knight
of
the
garter
as
such
is
entitled
to
claim
the
privilege
of

as
nowadays
the

is
reserved
for
those
of
the
rank
of

upwards

always

but
these
orders
are
nowadays
confined
to
peers
most
honourable
order
of
the
knights
of
the
bath
who
have
existed
from
a
remote
period
do
not
appear
as
such
to
have
made
any
additions
to
their
arms
prior
to
the
revival
of
the
order
in
at
that
time
similarly
to
the
orders
of
the
garter
and
the
thistle
the
order
was
of
one
class
only
and
composed
of
a
limited
number
of
knights
knights
of
that
order
were
then
distinguished
by
the
letters
which
it
should
be
noted
mean
knight
of
the
bath
and
not
knight
bachelor
as
so
many
people
now
imagine
there
is
nobody
at
the
present
time
who
is
entitled
to
use
these
letters
upon
those
of
the
bath
plates
which
now
remain
in
the
chapel
of
henry
vii
in
westminster
abbey
no
instance
will
be
found
in
which
the
collar
is
represented
outside
the
circle
which
is
pretty
good
evidence
that
although
isolated
examples
may
possibly
be
found
at
an
earlier
date
it
was
not
the
usual
custom
up
to
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
to
encircle
a
shield
with
a
collar
of
knighthood
these
knights
of
the
bath
as
they
were
termed
surrounded
their
escutcheons
with
circlets
of
crimson
edged
with
gold
and
bearing
thereupon
the
motto
of
the
order
tria
juncta
in
uno
in
gold
letters
although
at
that
time
it
does
not
appear
that
the
collar
of
the
order
was
ever
employed
for
armorial
purposes
instances
are
to
be
found
in
which
the
laurel
wreath
surrounded
the
circlet
with
the
motto
of
the
order
in
the
year
owing
to
the
large
number
of
officers
who
had
merited
reward
in
the
peninsular
campaign
it
was
considered
necessary
to
largely
increase
the
extent
and
scope
of
the
order
for
this
purpose
it
was
divided
into
two
divisions
the
military
division
and
the
civil
division
and
each
of
these
were
divided
into
three
classes
namely
knights
grand
cross
knights
commanders
and
companions
the
then
existing
knights
of
the
bath
became
knights
grand
cross
the
existing
collar
served
for
all
knights
grand
cross
but
the
old
badge
and
star
were
assigned
for
the
civil
division
of
the
order
a
new
pattern
being
designed
for
the
military
division
the
number
of
stalls
in
henry
vii
chapel
being
limited
the
erection
of
stall
plates
and
the
display
of
banners
ceased
those
then
in
position
were
allowed
to
remain
and
still
remain
at
the
present
moment
consequently
there
are
no
stall
plates
to
refer
to
in
the
matter
as
precedents
since
that
period
and
the
rules
need
to
be
obtained
from
other
sources
they
are
now
as
follows
a
knight
grand
cross
of
the
order
of
the
bath
surrounds
his
arms
with
the
circlet
as
was
theretofore
the
case
and
in
addition
he
surrounds
the
circlet
by
his
collar
from
which
depends
the
badge
either
military
or
civil
of
the
division
to
which
he
belongs
the
collar
is
really
for
practical
purposes
the
distinguishing
mark
of
a
knight
grand
cross
because
although
as
such
he
is
entitled
upon
payment
of
the
fees
to
claim
a
grant
of
supporters
he
is
under
no
compulsion
to
do
so
and
comparatively
but
few
avail
themselves
of
the
privilege
all
knights
of
the
bath
before
the
enlargement
of
the
order
had
supporters
a
knight
grand
cross
of
the
division
encircles
his
arms
with
the
laurel
wreath
in
addition
this
being
placed
outside
the
circlet
and
within
the
collar
of
the
order
the
collar
is
composed
of
gold
having
nine
imperial
crowns
and
eight
devices
of
the
rose
the
thistle
and
shamrock
issuing
from
a
sceptre
placed
alternately
and
enamelled
in
their
proper
colours
the
links
being
connected
with
seventeen
knots
enamelled
white
the
badges
of
the
military
and
civil
divisions
differ
considerably
knights
commanders
of
the
bath
have
no
collar
and
can
not
claim
a
grant
of
supporters
but
they
encircle
their
shields
with
the
circlet
of
the
order
suspending
their
badge
below
the
shield
by
the
ribbon
from
which
it
is
worn
knights
commanders
of
the
military
division
use
the
laurel
wreath
as
do
knights
grand
cross
but
no
members
of
any
class
of
the
civil
division
are
entitled
to
display
it
companions
of
the
order
do
not
use
the
helmet
of
a
knight
as
does
a
or
a
in
fact
the
only
difference
which
is
permissible
in
their
arms
from
those
of
an
undistinguished
commoner
is
that
they
are
allowed
to
suspend
the
badge
of
a
from
a
ribbon
below
their
shields
they
do
not
use
the
circlet
of
the
order
certain
cases
have
come
under
my
notice
in
which
a
military
has
added
a
laurel
wreath
to
his
armorial
bearings
but
whether
such
a
practice
is
correct
i
am
unaware
but
i
think
it
is
not
officially
recognised
most
exalted
order
of
the
star
of
like
the
order
of
the
bath
as
at
present
constituted
is
divided
into
three
classes
knights
grand
commanders
knights
commanders
and
companions
knights
grand
commanders
place
the
circlet
of
the
order
around
their
shields
this
is
of
light
blue
inscribed
with
the
motto
heaven
light
our
guide
this
in
its
turn
is
surrounded
by
the
collar
of
the
order
which
is
composed
of
alternate
links
of
the
indian
lotus
flower
crossed
and
the
united
red
and
white
rose
of
england
in
the
centre
of
the
collar
is
an
imperial
crown
from
which
depends
the
badge
of
the
order
this
being
an
onyx
cameo
of
the
effigy
of
her
late
majesty
queen
victoria
within
the
motto
of
the
order
and
surmounted
by
a
star
the
whole
being
richly
jewelled
the
surrounding
of
the
shield
by
the
circlet
of
the
order
doubtless
is
a
consequence
and
follows
upon
the
original
custom
of
the
armorial
use
of
the
garter
but
this
being
admitted
it
is
yet
permissible
to
state
that
that
practice
came
from
the
continent
and
there
is
little
reason
to
doubt
that
the
real
meaning
and
origin
of
the
custom
of
using
the
circlet
is
derived
from
the
continental
practice
which
has
for
long
been
usual
of
displaying
the
shield
of
arms
upon
the
star
of
an
order
of
knighthood
the
star
of
every
british
order
the
garter
included
contains
the
circlet
and
motto
of
the
order
and
it
is
easy
to
see
how
after
depicting
the
shield
of
arms
upon
the
star
of
the
order
the
result
will
be
that
the
circlet
of
the
order
surrounds
the
shield
no
armorial
warrant
upon
the
point
is
ever
issued
at
the
creation
of
an
order
the
thing
follows
as
a
matter
of
course
the
circlet
being
taken
from
the
star
to
surround
the
shield
without
further
authorisation
upon
this
point
there
can
be
no
doubt
inasmuch
as
the
garter
which
surrounds
the
shield
of
a
is
in
authoritative
heraldic
paintings
buckled
in
the
peculiar
manner
in
which
it
is
worn
and
in
which
it
is
depicted
upon
the
star
the
star
of
the
thistle
shows
the
plain
circlet
the
star
of
patrick
the
same
and
the
arms
of
a
knight
of
patrick
afford
a
curious
confirmation
of
my
contention
because
whilst
the
motto
of
the
order
is
specified
to
be
quis
separabit
the
circlet
used
for
armorial
purposes
includes
the
date
mdcclxxxiii
as
shown
upon
the
star
the
order
of
the
bath
again
has
a
plain
circlet
upon
the
star
and
the
badges
and
stars
of
the
military
knights
have
the
laurel
wreath
represented
in
heraldic
drawings
the
laurel
wreath
being
absent
from
the
stars
and
the
shields
of
those
who
are
members
of
the
civil
division
now
with
regard
to
the
order
of
the
star
of
india
the
motto
on
the
star
is
carried
upon
a
representation
of
a
ribbon
which
is
tied
in
a
curious
manner
and
my
own
opinion
is
that
the
circlet
used
to
surround
the
shield
of
a
or
should
as
in
the
case
of
the
garter
be
represented
not
as
a
simple
circlet
like
the
bath
or
thistle
but
as
a
ribbon
tied
in
the
curious
manner
represented
upon
the
star
this
tying
is
not
however
duplicated
upon
the
badge
and
possibly
i
may
be
told
that
the
circlet
and
its
use
are
taken
from
the
badge
and
not
from
the
star
the
reply
to
such
a
statement
is
first
that
there
is
no
garter
upon
the
badge
of
that
order
there
is
no
circlet
on
the
badge
of
the
thistle
and
the
circlet
on
the
badge
of
patrick
is
surrounded
by
a
wreath
of
trefoils
which
in
that
case
ought
to
appear
round
the
shield
of
a
this
wreath
of
trefoils
is
absent
from
the
star
further
no
companion
of
an
order
is
permitted
to
use
the
circlet
of
the
order
whilst
every
companion
has
his
badge
no
companion
has
a
star
though
i
hold
strongly
that
the
circlet
of
the
star
of
india
should
be
a
ribbon
tied
as
represented
on
the
star
of
the
order
i
must
admit
i
have
never
yet
come
across
an
official
instance
of
it
being
so
represented
this
however
is
a
point
upon
which
there
is
no
definite
warrant
of
instruction
and
is
not
the
conclusion
justifiable
that
on
this
matter
the
officers
of
arms
have
been
led
into
a
mistake
in
their
general
practice
by
an
oversight
and
possible
unfamiliarity
with

omission
which
is
all
the
more
inexplicable
owing
to
the
fact
that

that
the
heraldic

of
this
charter
have
never
been
conveyed
as
should
have
been
the
case
in
a
royal

has
caused
some
confusion
for

speaking

to
admit

superimposed

of
the
order
knights
of

were
required
to
show
that
all
their
four
grandparents
were
legally
entitled
to
bear
arms
but
so
many
provisions
for
the
exercise
of
discretion
in
dispensing
with
this
requirement
were
at
the

time
created

to
all

purposes
such

might
never
have
been
included
some
of
the
knights

even

have
no

are
themselves
grantees

still
others
would
be
unable
to
show
what
is
required
of
them
if
the
claims
of
their
grandparents
were
properly
investigated
it
should
perhaps
be
stated
that

when
granted

personal

in
the

hereditary

added

person
in

a
royal
licence
to

foreign

permitted
to
adopt
any
heraldic
form
decoration
or
display
which
that
order
confers
in
the
country
of
origin
official
recognition
exists
for
this
and
many
precedents
can
be
quoted
illustration
fig
of
the
catholic
order
of
the
knights
hospitallers
or
the
order
of
malta
the
rules
which
exist
in
foreign
countries
concerning
heraldic
privileges
of
the
knights
of
different
orders
are
very
varied
and
it
is
impossible
to
briefly
summarise
them
it
may
however
be
stated
that
the
most
usual
practice
is
to
display
the
shield
alone
in
the
centre
of
the
star
fig
as
with
us
the
collars
of
the
orders
are
placed
around
the
shields
and
the
badges
depend
below
but
the
use
of
the
circlet
carrying
the
motto
of
the
order
is
exclusively
a
british
practice
in
the
case
of
some
of
the
orders
however
the
official
coat
of
arms
of
the
order
is
quartered
impaled
or
borne
in
pretence
with
the
personal
arms
and
the
cross
patée
of
the
order
of
the
dannebrog
is
to
be
met
with
placed
in
front
of
a
shield
of
quarterings
the
charges
thereupon
appearing
in
the
angles
of
the
cross
i
am
not
sure
however
that
the
cases
which
have
come
under
my
notice
should
not
be
rather
considered
definite
and
hereditary
grants
of
augmentation
this
being
perhaps
a
more
probable
explanation
than
that
such
a
method
of
display
followed
as
a
matter
of
course
on
promotion
to
the
order
the

of

the
manner
in
which
a
grand

of
the
real
catholic
and
celibate
order

of
the
order
on
his

the
contrary
assume
the
cross
upon
the
shield
itself
whilst
the
knights

suspend
it
from
the
bottom
of
the
shield
the
members
of
the
ancient
order
of
la
cordelière
formerly
encircled
their
lozenges
with
a
representation
of
the
cordelière
which
formed
a
part
of
their
habit
and
the
officers
of
the
ecclesiastical
orders
frequently
surround
their
escutcheons
with
rosaries
from
which
depend
crucifixes
whether
this
latter
practice
however
should
be
considered
merely
a
piece
of
artistic
decoration
or
whether
it
should
be
regarded
as
an
ecclesiastical
matter
or
should
be
included
within
the
purview
of
armory
i
leave
others
to
decide
by
a
curious
fiction
for
the
origin
of
which
it
is
not
easy
to
definitely
account
unless
it
is
a
survival
of
the
celibacy
required
in
certain
orders
a
knight
is
not
supposed
to
share
the
insignia
of
any
order
of
knighthood
with
his
wife
there
is
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
his
own
knighthood
does
confer
upon
her
both
precedence
and
titular
rank
and
why
there
should
be
any
necessity
for
the
statement
to
be
made
as
to
the
theoretical
position
has
long
been
a
puzzle
to
me
such
a
theory
however
is
considered
to
be
correct
and
as
a
consequence
in
modern
times
it
has
become
a
rigid
rule
that
the
arms
of
the
wife
of
a
knight
must
not
be
impaled
upon
a
shield
when
it
is
displayed
within
the
circlet
of
an
order
no
such
rule
existed
in
ancient
times
and
many
instances
can
be
found
in
which
impaled
shields
or
the
shield
of
the
wife
only
are
met
with
inside
a
representation
of
the
garter
in
the
warrant
recently
issued
for
queen
alexandra
the
arms
of
england
and
denmark
are
impaled
within
a
garter
this
may
be
quite
exceptional
and
consequent
upon
the
fact
that
her
majesty
is
herself
a
member
of
the
order
nevertheless
the
modern
idea
is
that
when
a
knight
of
any
order
impales
the
arms
of
his
wife
he
must
use
two
shields
placed
accollé
the
dexter
surmounting
the
sinister
fig
upon
the
dexter
shield
is
represented
the
arms
of
the
knight
within
the
circlet
or
the
circlet
and
collar
as
the
case
may
be
of
his
order
on
the
sinister
shield
the
arms
of
the
knight
are
impaled
with
those
of
his
wife
and
this
shield
for
the
purpose
of
artistic
balance
is
usually
surrounded
with
a
meaningless
and
inartistic
floral
or
laurel
wreath
to
make
its
size
similar
to
the
dimensions
of
the
dexter
shield
the
widow
of
a
knight
of
any
order
is
required
at
present
to
immediately
discontinue
the
use
of
the
ensigns
of
that
order
and
to
revert
to
the
plain
impaled
lozenge
which
she
would
be
entitled
to
as
the
widow
of
an
undecorated
gentleman
as
she
retains
her
titular
rank
such
a
regulation
seems
absurd
but
it
undoubtedly
exists
and
until
it
is
altered
must
be
conformed
to
knights
grand
cross
and
knights
commanders
as
also
knights
bachelors
use
the
open
affronté
helmet
of
a
knight
companions
of
any
order
and
members
of
those
orders
which
do
not
confer
any
precedence
or
title
of
knighthood
use
only
the
close
profile
helmet
of
a
gentleman
a
knight
bachelor
of
course
is
at
liberty
to
impale
the
arms
of
his
wife
upon
his
escutcheon
without
employing
the
double
form
it
only
makes
the
use
of
the
double
escutcheon
for
knights
of
orders
the
more
incomprehensible
reference
should
also
be
made
to
the
subject
of
impalement
which
will
be
found
in
the
chapter
upon
marshalling
chapter
xxxv
the
armorial
bearings
of
a
lady
bearing
in
mind
that
armory
was
so
deeply
interwoven
with
all
that
was
best
in
chivalry
it
is
curious
that
the
armorial
status
of
a
woman
should
have
been
left
so
undefined
a
query
as
to
how
a
lady
may
bear
arms
will
be
glibly
answered
for
her
as
maid
fig
and
as
widow
figs
and
by
the
most
elementary
heraldic
but
a
little
consideration
will
show
how
far
short
our
knowledge
falls
of
a
complete
or
uniform
set
of
rules
let
what
is
definitely
known
be
first
stated
in
the
first
place
no
woman
save
a
sovereign
can
inherit
use
or
transmit
crest
or
motto
nor
may
she
use
a
helmet
or
mantling
all
daughters
if
unmarried
bear
a
the
paternal
arms
and
quarterings
of
their
father
with
his
difference
marks
if
their
mother
were
an
heiress
they
quarter
her
arms
with
those
of
her
father
in
england
save
in
the
royal
family
and
in
this
case
even
it
is
a
matter
of
presumption
only
there
is
no
seniority
amongst
daughters
and
the
difference
marks
of
all
daughters
are
those
borne
by
the
father
and
none
other
there
are
no
marks
of
distinction
as
between
the
daughters
themselves
in
scotland
however
seniority
does
exist
according
to
priority
of
birth
and
though
scottish
heraldic
law
provides
no
marks
of
cadency
as
between
sister
and
sister
the
laws
of
arms
north
of
the
tweed
recognise
seniority
of
birth
in
the
event
of
a
certain
set
of
circumstances
arising
in
scotland
as
doubtless
many
are
aware
certain
untitled
scottish
families
for
reasons
which
may
or
may
not
be
known
have
been
permitted
to
use
supporters
to
their
arms
when
the
line
vests
in
coheirs
the
eldest
born
daughter
as
heir
of
line
assumes
the
supporters
unless
some
other
limitation
has
been
attached
to
them
scottish
supporters
are
peculiar
things
to
deal
with
unless
the
exact
terms
of
the
patent
of
grant
or
matriculation
are
known
the
lozenge
of
an
unmarried
lady
is
frequently
surmounted
by
a
true
knot
of
ribbon
usually
painted
blue
fig
it
has
no
particular
meaning
and
no
official
recognition
though
plenty
of
official
use
and
practically
its
status
is
no
more
than
a
piece
of
supposedly
artistic
ornament
concerning
the
law
for
unmarried
ladies
therefore
there
is
neither
doubt
nor
dispute
a
widow
bears
arms
upon
a
lozenge
this
showing
the
arms
of
her
late
husband
impaled
with
those
of
her
own
family
fig
or
with
these
latter
displayed
on
an
escutcheon
of
pretence
if
she
be
an
heir
or
coheir
fig
the
other
state
in
the
progress
of
life
in
which
a
lady
may
hope
or
expect
to
find
herself
is
that
of
married
life
now
how
should
a
married
lady
display
arms
echo
and
the
alike
answer
how
does
know
this
fault
for
such
it
undoubtedly
is
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
laws
of
arms
evolved
themselves
in
that
period
when
a
married
woman
was
little
accounted
of
as
an
unmarried
heiress
she
undoubtedly
was
a
somebody
as
a
widowed
and
dowager
she
was
likewise
of
account
but
as
a
wedded
wife
her
identity
was
lost
for
the
married
women
property
act
was
not
in
existence
nor
was
it
thought
of
so
completely
was
it
recognised
that
all
rights
and
inheritance
of
the
wife
devolved
of
right
upon
the
husband
that
formerly
the
husband
enjoyed
any
peerage
honours
which
had
descended
to
the
wife
and
was
summoned
to
parliament
as
a
peer
in
his
wife
peerage
small
wonder
then
that
the
same
ideas
dominated
the
rules
of
armory
these
only
provide
ways
and
methods
for
the
husband
to
bear
the
wife
arms
this
is
curious
because
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
at
a
still
earlier
period
the
practice
of
impalement
was
entirely
confined
to
women
and
that
unless
the
wife
happened
to
be
an
heiress
the
husband
did
not
trouble
to
impale
her
arms
but
a
little
thought
will
show
that
the
two
are
not
at
variance
for
if
monuments
and
other
matters
of
are
ignored
the
earliest
examples
of
impalement
which
have
come
down
to
us
are
all
almost
without
exception
examples
of
arms
borne
by
widows
one
can
not
get
over
the
fact
that
a
wife
during
coverture
had
practically
no
legal
status
at
all
the
rules
governing
impalement
and
the
conjunction
of
the
arms
of
man
and
wife
as
they
are
to
be
borne
by
the
husband
are
recited
in
the
chapter
upon
marshalling
which
also
details
the
ways
in
which
a
widow
bears
arms
in
the
different
ranks
of
life
nothing
would
be
gained
by
repeating
them
here
it
may
be
noted
however
that
it
is
not
considered
correct
for
a
widow
to
make
use
of
the
true
lover
knot
of
blue
ribbon
which
is
sometimes
used
in
the
case
of
an
unmarried
lady
a
divorce
puts
matters
statu
quo
there
still
remains
however
the
question
of
the
bearing
of
arms
in
her
own
right
by
a
married
woman
under
coverture
at
the
present
day
the
earliest
grant
of
arms
that
i
can
put
my
hands
upon
to
a
woman
is
one
dated
it
is
moreover
the
only

which
i

in
this

the
arms
are
painted
upon
a
the
grant
was
made
in
her
husband
lifetime
but
his
arms
are
not
impaled
therewith
evidently
therefore
the
lady
bears
arms
her
own
and
the
presumption
would
seem
to
be
that
a
married
lady
bears
her
arms
without
reference
to
her
husband
and
bears
them
upon
a
shield
on
the
other
hand
the
grant
to
lady
pearce
referred
to
on
an
earlier
page
whilst
not
blazoning
the
pearce
arms
shows
the
painting
upon
the
patent
to
have
been
a
lozenge
of
the
arms
of
pearce
charged
with
a
baronet
hand
impaled
with
the
arms
then
granted
for
the
maiden
name
of
lady
pearce
on
the
other
hand
a
grant
is
printed
in
vol
of
the
notes
to
the
visitation
of
england
and
wales
the
grant
is
to
dame
judith
diggs
widow
of
sir
maurice
diggs
now
wife
of
daniel
sheldon
and
to
dame
margaret
sheldon
her
sister
relict
of
sir
joseph
sheldon
knight
late
alderman
and
sometime
lord
mayor
of
the
city
of
london
daughters
and
coheirs
of
george
rose
of
eastergate
the
operative
clause
of
the
grant
is
do
by
these
presents
grant
and
assign
to
said
dame
judith
and
dame
margaret
the
armes
hereafter
mentioned
ermine
an
eagle
displayed
sable
membered
and
beaked
gules
debruised
with
a
bendlet
componè
or
and
azure
as
in
the
margin
hereof
more
plainly
appears
depicted
to
be
borne
and
used
for
ever
hereafter
by
them
said
dame
judith
diggs
and
dame
margaret
sheldon
and
the
descendants
of
their
bodies
respectively
lawfully
begotten
according
to
the
laws
rules
and
practice
of
armes
in
each
case
it
will
be
noted
that
the
sisters
were
respectively
wife
and
widow
of
some
one
of
the
name
of
sheldon
and
it
might
possibly
be
supposed
that
these
were
arms
granted
for
the
name
of
sheldon
there
seems
however
to
be
very
little
doubt
that
these
are
the
arms
for
rose
the
painting
is
however
of
the
single
coat
of
rose
and
one
is
puzzled
to
know
why
the
arms
are
not
painted
in
conjunction
with
those
of
sheldon
the
same
practice
was
followed
in
the
patent
which
was
granted
to
nelson
lady
hamilton
this
patent
which
both
heraldically
and
historically
is
excessively
interesting
was
printed
in
full
on
vol
of
the
the
arms
which
in
the
grant
are
specifically
said
to
be
the
arms
of
lyons
not
of
hamilton
are
painted
upon
a
lozenge
with
no
reference
to
the
arms
of
hamilton
in
each
of
these
cases
however
the
grantee
of
arms
has
been
an
heiress
so
that
the
clause
by
which
the
arms
are
limited
to
the
descendants
does
not
help
an
instance
of
a
grant
to
a
man
and
his
wife
where
the
wife
was
not
an
heiress
is
printed
in
the
right
to
bear
arms
and
in
this
case
the
painting
shows
the
arms
impaled
with
those
of
the
husband
the
grant
to
the
wife
has
no
hereditary
limitations
and
presumably
her
descendants
would
never
be
able
to
quarter
the
arms
of
the
wife
no
matter
even
if
by
the
extinction
of
the
other
issue
she
eventually
became
a
coheir
the
fact
that
the
arms
of
man
and
wife
are
herein
granted
together
prevents
any
one
making
any
deduction
as
to
what
is
the
position
of
the
wife
alone
there
was
a
patent
issued
in
the
year
to
a
sarah
lax
widow
of
john
lax
to
take
the
name
and
arms
of
maynard
such
name
and
arms
to
be
borne
by
herself
and
her
issue
the
painting
in
this
case
is
of
the
arms
of
maynard
alone
upon
a
lozenge
and
the
crest
which
was
to
be
borne
by
her
male
descendants
is
quite
a
separate
painting
in
the
body
of
the
grant
and
not
in
conjunction
with
the
lozenge
now
maynard
was
a
widow
and
it
is
manifestly
wrong
that
she
should
bear
the
arms
as
if
she
were
unmarried
yet
how
was
she
to
bear
them
she
was
bearing
the
name
of
lax
because
that
had
been
her
husband
name
and
she
took
the
name
of
maynard
which
presumably
her
husband
would
have
taken
had
he
been
alive
she
herself
was
a
miss
jefferson
so
would
she
have
been
entitled
to
have
placed
the
arms
of
jefferson
upon
an
escutcheon
of
pretence
in
the
centre
of
the
arms
of
maynard
presumably
she
would
because
suppose
the
husband
had
assumed
the
name
and
arms
of
maynard
in
his
lifetime
he
certainly
would
have
been
entitled
to
place
his
wife
arms
of
jefferson
on
an
escutcheon
of
pretence
on
march
francis
culling
carr
and
his
second
wife
emily
blanche
daughter
of
andrew
morton
carr
and
niece
of
the
late
sir
william
maynard
gomm
both
assumed
by
royal
licence
the
additional
surname
and
arms
of
gomm
neither
nor
appear
to
have
had
any
blood
descent
from
the
gomm
family
consequently
the
gomm
arms
were
granted
to
both
husband
and
wife
and
the
curious
part
is
that
they
were
not
identical
the
marks
showing
that
there
was
no
blood
relationship
being
a
canton
for
the
husband
and
a
cross
crosslet
for
the
wife
in
this
case
the
arms
were
impaled
one
is
puzzled
to
know
why
the
grant
to
the
wife
was
necessary
as
well
as
the
grant
to
the
husband
in
massy
widow
of
hugh
massy
assumed
the
name
and
arms
of
richardson
in
lieu
of
massy
massy
was
the
only
child
of
major
richardson
brady
who
had
previously
assumed
by
royal
licence
the
arms
of
brady
only
the
painting
upon
the
patent
is
a
lozenge
bearing
the
arms
of
massy
and
upon
an
escutcheon
of
pretence
the
arms
of
richardson
of
course
the
arms
of
massy
as
a
widow
previously
to
the
issue
of
the
royal
licence
were
a
lozenge
of
the
arms
of
massy
and
on
an
escutcheon
of
pretence
the
arms
of
brady
a
few
years
ago
a
grant
of
arms
was
issued
to
a
sharpe
widow
of
major
sharpe
the
arms
were
be
borne
by
and
the
descendants
of
her
late
husband
and
by
the
other
descendants
of
her
husband
father
so
that
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
these
were
the
arms
of
sharpe
i
have
no
idea
who
sharpe
was
and
i
do
not
know
that
she
possessed
any
arms
of
her
own
let
us
presume
she
did
not
now
unless
a
widow
may
bear
the
arms
of
her
late
husband
on
a
lozenge
whether
she
has
arms
to
impale
with
them
or
not
how
on
earth
is
she
to
bear
arms
at
all
and
yet
the
grant
most
distinctly
was
primarily
to
sharpe
after
the
death
of
general
ross
the
victor
of
bladensburg
a
grant
of
an
augmentation
was
made
to
be
placed
upon
the
monument
to
the
memory
of
the
general
plate
the
grant
also
was
for
the
augmentation
to
be
borne
by
his
widow
during
her
widowhood
but
no
mention
appears
of
the
arms
of
ross
nor
as
far
as
i
can
ascertain
was
proof
officially
made
that
ross
was
in
her
own
right
entitled
to
arms
consequently
whether
she
really
was
or
was
not
we
may
assume
that
as
far
as
the
official
authorities
officially
knew
she
was
not
and
the
same
query
formulated
with
regard
to
the
sharpe
patent
holds
good
in
this
case
the
painting
on
the
patent
shows
the
arms
upon
a
shield
and
placed
above
is
a
helmet
surmounted
by
the
crest
of
augmentation
and
the
family
crest
of
ross
so
that
from
the
cases
we
have
mentioned
instances
can
be
found
of
the
arms
of
a
wife
upon
a
shield
alone
and
of
a
widow
having
arms
depicted
upon
a
lozenge
such
arms
being
on
different
occasions
the
impaled
arms
of
her
husband
and
herself
or
the
arms
of
herself
alone
or
of
her
husband
alone
and
we
have
arms
granted
to
a
wife
and
depicted
as
an
impalement
or
upon
a
lozenge
so
that
from
grants
it
seems
almost
impossible
to
deduce
any
decided
and
unquestionable
rule
as
to
how
wife
or
widow
should
bear
a
coat
of
arms
there
is
however
one
other
source
from
which
profitable
instruction
may
be
drawn
i
refer
to
the
methods
of
depicting
arms
upon
hatchments
and
more
particularly
to
the
hatchment
of
a
married
woman
now
a
hatchment
is
strictly
and
purely
personal
and
in
the
days
when
the
use
of
such
an
article
was
an
everyday
matter
the
greatest
attention
was
paid
to
the
proper
marshalling
of
the
arms
thereupon
there
are
so
many
varying
circumstances
that
we
have
here
only
space
to
refer
to
the
three
simple
rules
and
these
uncomplicated
by
any
exceptional
circumstances
which
governed
the
hatchments
of
maid
wife
and
widow
in
the
first
case
the
hatchment
of
an
unmarried
lady
showed
the
whole
of
the
background
black
the
paternal
arms
on
a
lozenge
and
this
suspended
by
a
knot
of
blue
ribbon
in
the
hatchment
of
a
widow
the
background
again
was
all
black
the
arms
were
upon
a
lozenge
but
without
the
knot
of
ribbon
and
the
lozenge
showed
the
arms
of
husband
and
wife
impaled
or
with
the
wife
in
pretence
as
circumstances
might
dictate
the
hatchment
of
a
wife
was
entirely
different
like
the
foregoing
it
was
devoid
of
course
of
helmet
mantling
crest
or
motto
but
the
background
was
white
on
the
dexter
side
to
show
that
the
husband
was
still
alive
and
black
on
the
sinister
to
show
the
wife
was
dead
but
the
impaled
arms
were
not
depicted
upon
a
lozenge
but
upon
a
shield
and
the
shield
was
surmounted
by
the
true
lover
knot
of
blue
ribbon
i
have
already
stated
that
when
the
rules
of
arms
were
in
the
making
the
possibility
of
a
married
woman
bearing
arms
in
her
own
right
was
quite
ignored
and
theoretically
even
now
the
husband
bears
his
wife
arms
for
her
upon
his
shield
but
the
arms
of
a
man
are
never
depicted
suspended
from
a
true
lover
knot
such
a
display
is
distinctly
feminine
and
i
verily
believe
that
the
correct
way
for
a
married
woman
to
use
arms
if
she
desires
the
display
thereof
to
be
personal
to
herself
rather
than
to
her
husband
is
to
place
her
husband
arms
impaled
with
her
own
upon
a
shield
suspended
from
a
true
lover
knot
and
without
helmet
mantling
crest
or
motto
at
any
rate
such
a
method
of
display
is
a
correct
one
it
is
in
no
way
open
to
criticism
on
the
score
of
inaccuracy
it
has
precedent
in
its
favour
and
it
affords
a
very
desirable
means
of
distinction
my
only
hesitation
is
that
one
can
not
say
it
is
the
only
way
or
that
it
would
be
incorrect
for
the
husband
at
any
rate
it
is
the
only
way
of
drawing
a
distinction
between
the
married
achievements
of
the
husband
and
the
wife
the
limitations
attached
to
a
lady
heraldic
display
being
what
they
are
it
has
long
been
felt
and
keenly
felt
by
every
one
attempting
heraldic
design
that
artistic
treatment
of
a
lady
arms
savoured
almost
of
the
impossible
what
delicacy
of
treatment
can
possibly
be
added
to
the
hard
outline
of
the
lozenge
the
substitution
of
curvilinear
for
straight
lines
in
the
outline
and
even
the
foliation
of
the
outline
goes
but
a
little
way
as
an
equivalent
to
the
extensive
artistic
opportunities
which
the
mantling
affords
to
a
designer
when
depicting
the
arms
of
a
man
to
a
certain
extent
two
attempts
have
been
made
towards
providing
a
remedy
neither
can
properly
claim
recognition
though
both
have
been
employed
in
a
manner
the
one
consists
of
the
knot
of
ribbon
the
other
consists
of
the
use
of
the
cordelière
in
their
present
usage
the
former
is
meaningless
and
practically
senseless
whilst
the
use
of
the
latter
is
radically
wrong
and
in
my
opinion
little
short
of
imposture
the
knot
of
ribbon
when
employed
is
usually
in
the
form
of
a
thin
streamer
of
blue
ribbon
tied
in
the
conventional
true
lover
knot
fig
but
the
imbecility
and
inconsistency
of
its
use
lies
in
the
fact
that
except
upon
a
hatchment
it
has
been
denied
by
custom
to
married
women
and
widows
who
have
gained
their
lovers
whilst
its
use
is
sanctioned
for
the
unmarried
lady
who
unless
she
be
affianced
neither
has
nor
ought
to
have
anything
whatever
to
do
with
lovers
or
with
their
knot
the
women
who
are
display
the
knot
women
whom
love
has
fast
tied
up
unless
the
foregoing
opinion
as
to
the
correct
way
to
display
the
arms
of
a
married
lady
which
i
have
expressed
be
correct
must
leave
the
knot
alone
but
as
matters
stand
heraldically
at
the
moment
the
ribbon
may
be
used
advantageously
with
the
lozenge
of
an
unmarried
lady
with
reference
to
the
cordelière
some
writers
assert
that
its
use
is
optional
others
that
its
use
is
confined
to
widow
ladies
now
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
nothing
whatever
of
the
kind
it
is
really
the
insignia
of
the
old
french
order
of
the
cordelière
which
was
founded
by
anne
of
bretagne
widow
of
charles
in
its
membership
being
confined
to
widow
ladies
of
noble
family
the
cordelière
was
the
waist
girdle
which
formed
a
part
of
the
insignia
of
the
order
and
it
took
its
place
around
the
lozenges
of
the
arms
of
the
members
in
a
manner
similar
to
the
armorial
use

of

though
the

long
since
extinct
it
is
neither
right
nor
proper
that
any

chapter

official
heraldic
insignia
the
armory
of
all
other
nations
than
our
own
is
rich
in
heraldic
emblems
of
office
in
france
this
was
particularly
the
case
and
france
undoubtedly
for
many
centuries
gave
the
example
to
be
followed
by
other
civilised
countries
in
all
matters
of
honour
and
etiquette
if
english
heraldry
were
entirely
destitute
of
official
heraldic
ensigns
perhaps
the
development
elsewhere
of
this
branch
of
armory
might
be
dismissed
as
an
entirely
foreign
growth
but
this
is
far
from
being
the
case
as
there
are
some
number
of
cases
in
which
these
official
emblems
do
exist
in
england
however
the
instances
are
governed
by
no
scale
of
comparative
importance
and
the
appearance
of
such
tokens
can
only
be
described
as
capricious
that
a
more
extended
usage
might
with
advantage
be
made
no
one
can
deny
for
usage
of
this
character
would
teach
the
general
public
that
armory
had
a
meaning
and
a
value
it
would
increase
the
interest
in
heraldry
and
also
assist
greatly
in
the
rapidly
increasing
revival
of
heraldic
knowledge
the
existence
of
these
heraldic
emblems
would
manifestly
tend
towards
a
revival
of
the
old
and
interestingly
excellent
custom
of
regularly
setting
up
in
appropriate
public
places
the
arms
of
those
who
have
successively
held
various
offices
the
inns
of
court
george
chapel
the
public
office
at
the
college
of
arms
and
the
halls
of
some
of
the
livery
companies
are
amongst
the
few
places
of
importance
where
the
custom
still
obtains
and
yet
what
an
interesting
memorial
such
a
series
always
becomes
the
following
list
may
not
be
entirely
complete

it
is
fairly
so
as
far
as

is
concerned

i

also
complete
as

have
purposely
to
make
the

absolutely
complete
included

may
possibly
be

properly
considered
ensigns

it

curious
to
note
that
the
pallium
which
occurs
in
all
archiepiscopal
coats
of
arms
save
that
of
york
is
now
very
generally
conceded
to
have
been
more
in
the
nature
of
an
emblem
of
the
of
archbishop
it
being
a
part
of
his
ecclesiastical
costume
than
a
charge
in
a
concrete
impersonal
coat
of
arms
for
a
defined
area
of
archiepiscopal
jurisdiction
in
this
connection
it
is
interesting
to
observe
that
the
archbishops

anciently
used
the
pallium

of
the

now
regularly
employed

xxxvii
augmentations
of
honour
of
all
heraldic
distinctions
the
possession
of
an
augmentation
of
honour
is
the
one
most
prized
the
sovereign
is
of
course
the
fountain
of
honour
and
though
ordinary
grants
of
arms
are
made
by
letters
patent
under
the
hands
and
seals
of
the
kings
of
arms
by
virtue
of
the
powers
expressly
and
specifically
conferred
upon
them
in
the
letters
patent
respectively
appointing
them
to
their
offices
a
grant
of
arms
is
theoretically
a
grant
from
the
crown
the
privilege
of
the
possession
of
arms
in
the
ordinary
event
is
left
in
the
discretion
of
the
earl
marshal
whose
warrant
is
a
condition
precedent
to
the
issue
of
a
grant
providing
a
person
is
palpably
living
in
that
style
and
condition
of
life
in
which
the
use
of
arms
is
usual
subject
always
to
the
earl
marshal
pleasure
and
discretion
a
grant
of
arms
can
ordinarily
be
obtained
upon
payment
of
the
usual
fees
the
social
status
of
grantees
of
arms
is
considerably
in
advance
of
the
status
of
grantees
in
the
tudor
period
an
augmentation
of
arms
however
is
on
a
totally
and
entirely
different
footing
it
is
an
especial
mark
of
favour
from
the
sovereign
and
the
effective
grant
is
a
royal
warrant
under
the
hand
and
privy
seal
of
the
sovereign
the
warrant
recites
and
requires
that
the
augmentation
granted
shall
be
exemplified
and
recorded
in
the
college
of
arms
augmentations
have
been
less
frequently
conferred
in
recent
years
than
was
formerly
the
case
technically
speaking
a
gift
of
arms
by
the
sovereign
direct
where
none
previously
existed
is
not
an
augmentation
though
one
is
naturally
inclined
to
include
such
grants
in
the
category
such
an
example
is
met
with
in
the
shield
granted
to
colonel
carlos
by
king
charles
to
commemorate
their
mutual
adventures
in
the
oak

over

proper

there
are
many
gorgeous
legends
relating
to
augmentations
and
arms
which
are
said
to
have
been
granted
by
william
the
conqueror
as
rewards
after
the
battle
of
hastings
personally
i
do
not
believe
in
a
single
one
there
was
a
certain
augmentation
borne
by
the
dodge
family
which
if
it
be
correct
dates
from
the
year
of
edward
but
whether
this
be
authentic
it
is
impossible
to
say
most
people
consider
the
alleged
of
a
forgery
and
if
this
be
so
the
arms
only
exist
by
right
of
subsequent
record
and
the
question
of
augmentation
rests
upon
tradition
the
curious
charge
of
the
woman
breast
distilling
drops
of
milk
to
typify
the
nourishment
afforded
to
the
king
army
is
at
any
rate
most
interesting

the
earliest
undoubted
one
in
this
country
that
i
am
aware
of
dates
from
the
reign
of
edward
iii
sir
john
de
pelham
shared
in
the
glory
of
the
battle
of
poictiers
and
in
the
capture
of
the
french
king
john
to
commemorate
this
he
was
granted
two
round
buckles
with
thongs
the
pelham
family
arms
were
azure
three
pelicans
argent
and
as
will
be
seen
these
family
arms
were
quartered
with
the
buckles
and
thongs
on
a

an
augmentation
the

but
it
was
not
until
the
reign
of
queen
elizabeth
that
the
augmentation
to
commemorate
this
was
granted
the
battle
of
flodden
was
won
by
the
earl
of
surrey
afterwards
the
duke
of
norfolk
and
amongst
the
many
rewards
which
the
king
showered
upon
his
successful
marshal
was
the
augmentation
to
his
arms
of
a
pierced
in
the
mouth
with
an
arrow
depicted
on
the
colours
for
the
arms
of
the
kingdom
of
scotland
which
the
said
james
late
king
of
scots
bore
according
to
the
act
of
parliament
under
which
it
was
granted
this
augmentation
would
seem
now
to
belong
exclusively
to
lord
mowbray
and
stourton
and
hon
mary
petre
but
it
is
borne
apparently
with
official
sanction
or
more
likely
perhaps
by
official
inadvertence
by
the
duke
of
norfolk
and
the
rest
of
the
howard
family
the
battle
of
agincourt
is
referred
to
by
shakespeare
who
puts
these
words
into

henry

gentle
his
condition
there
is
actual
foundation
in
fact
for
these
lines
for
in
a
writ
couched
in
very
stringent
and
severe
terms
issued
by
the
same
king
in
after
years
decreeing
penalties
for
the
improper
assumption
and
use
of
false
arms
specific
exception
is
made
in
favour
of
those
who
bore
arms
with
us
at
the
battle
of
agincourt
evidently
this
formed
a
very
extensive
kind
of
augmentation
the
reign
of
queen
elizabeth
furnishes
an
interesting
example
of
the
gift
of
a
complete
coat
in
the
case
of
sir
francis
drake
who
had
been
using
the
arms
of
another
family
of
the
same
name
the
representative
of
that
family
complained
to
the
queen
that
sir
francis
whom
he
styled
an
upstart
should
take
such
liberties
with
his
arms
whereupon
the
queen
said
she
would
give
sir
francis
arms
which
should
outrival
those
of
his
namesake
at
least
such
is
the
legend
and
though
the
arms
themselves
were
granted
by
clarenceux
king
of
arms
and
i
have
not
yet
found
any
royal
warrant
indicating
that
the
grant
was
made
by
specific
royal
command
it
is
possible

story
is
correct

arms
are

does
also

at

battle

in

service
of

no
less
than

of
the
battle

his
disastrous

how

in

wanderings
by
colonel
carlos
who
hid
with
him
in
the
oak
tree
at
boscobel
afterwards
the
king
accompanied

jane
lane
on
horseback
as
her
servant
to
the
coast
whence
he
fled
to
the
continent
the
reward
of
colonel
carlos
was
the
gift
of
the
entire
coat
of
arms
already
referred
to
the
lanes

not
until
after
some
years
had
passed
and
the

again

canton
was
added
to
their
shield
they
are
the
family
to
whom
such
an
honour
has
been
given
and
a
most
curious
result
has
happened
when
the
use
of
armorial
bearings
was
taxed
by
act
of
parliament
the
royal
arms
were
specially
exempted
and
on
account
of
this
canton
the
lane
family
claimed
and
obtained
exemption
from
the
tax
a
few
years
later
a
crest
was
granted
to
them

horse
couped

the

the

received
the
augmentation
on
the

a
landscape
showing
the
the
disabled
ship

the

the
one
crest
was
the
plume
of
triumph
given
to
the
admiral
by
the
sultan
selim
and
his
second
crest
which
however
is
not
a
crest
of
augmentation
was
the
stern
of
the
spanish
ship
after
his
death
at
the
battle
of
trafalgar
his
brother
was
created
earl
nelson
and
a
second
augmentation
namely
a
fess
wavy
sable
with

trafalgar
upon

in

letters
was
added
to

this
however
has
since
been
discontinued
except
by
lord
bridport
who
quarters
it
whilst
the
nelson
family
has
reverted
to
the
arms

they
were
borne
by
the
great
admiral
after
the
death
of

at
the
battle
of

lord
collingwood
took
command
and
though
naval
experts
think
that
the
action
of
collingwood
greatly
minimised
the
number
of
prizes
which
would
have
resulted
from

was
prepared
by

for
that
evening
to
meet
the
english
officers
captain
broke
defeated
the

an
engagement
which
only
lasted
a
very
short
time
he
was
granted
an
additional

issuing
from

with
an
english
in

of

to
add
to
his

it
is
interesting
to
note
that
one
of
his
supporters
though
not
a
part
of
his
augmentation
represents
a
christian
slave
in
memory
of
those
in
captivity
at

when
he
captured

were
several
augmentations

his

a
representation
of

very
similar
being
a

instances
of
a
similar
character
are
to
be
found
in
the
arms
of

the
arms
of
lord
gough
are
most
remarkable
inasmuch
as
they
show
no
less
than
two
distinct
and
different
augmentations
both
earned
by
the
same
man
in
for
his
services
in

received
a
representation

at

a
similar
lion

sir
george
pollock
of
the
khyber

everlasting
fame
for
himself
in
the
first
afghan
war
by
forcing
the
khyber
pass
and
by
the
capture
of
cabul
for
this
he
was
given
an
eastern
crown
and
the
word
khyber
on
a
chief
as
well
as
three
cannon
upon
a
canton
and
at
the
same
time
he
was
granted
an
additional
crest
a
lion
holding
an
afghan
banner
with
the
staff
thereof
broken
with
him
it
seemed
as
if
the
practice
of
granting
augmentations
for
military
services
had
ceased
lord
roberts
has
none
neither
has
lord
wolseley
but
recently
the
old
practice
was
reverted
to
in
favour
of
lord
kitchener
his
family
arms
were
azure
a
chevron
cottised
between
three
bustards
and
in
the
centre
chief
point
a
bezant
with
a
stag
head
for
a
crest
but
for
smashing
the
khalifa
he
has
been
given
the
union
jack
and
the
egyptian
flag
with
the
staves
encircled
by
a
coronet
bearing
the
word
khartoum
all
on
a
pile
superimposed
over
his
family
arms
he
also
received
a
second
crest
of
an
elephant
head
holding
a
sword
in
its
trunk
issuing
from
a
mural
crown
at
the
conclusion
of
the
south
african
war
a
second
augmentation
was
granted
to
him
this
taking
the
form
of
a
chief
two
other
very
interesting
instances
of
augmentation
of
arms
are
worthy
of
mention
sir
ralph
abercromby
after
a
distinguished
career
fought
and
won
the
battle
of
aboukir
bay
only
to
die
a
few
days
later
on
board
of
his
wounds
received
in
the
battle
but
long
before
he
had
fought
and
conquered
the
french
at
valenciennes
and
in
had
been
made
a
knight
of
the
bath
the
arms
which
are
upon
his
stall
plate
in
westminster
abbey
include
his
augmentation
which
is
an
arm
in
armour
encircled
by
a
wreath
of
laurel
supporting
the
french
standard
sir
william
hoste
gained
the
celebrated
victory
over
the
french
fleet
off
the
island
of
lissa
in
and
the
augmentation
which
was
granted
was
a
representation
of
his
gold
medal
hanging
from
a
naval
crown
and
an
additional
crest
an
arm
holding
a
flag
inscribed
with
the
word
cattaro
the
scene
of
another
of
his
victories
peace
has
its
victories
no
less
than
war
but
there
is
generally
very
much
less
fuss
made
about
them
consequently
the
augmentations
to
commemorate
entirely
pacific
actions
are
considerably
fewer
in
number
the
speke
augmentation
has
been
elsewhere
referred
to
and
reference
may
be
made
to
the
ross
augmentation
to
commemorate
the
arctic
exploits
of
sir
john
ross
it
is
a
very
common
idea
that
arms
were
formerly
to
be
obtained
by
conquest
in
battle
like
many
other
heraldic
ideas
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
truth
in
the
idea
from
which
very
erroneous
generalisations
have
been
made
the
old
legend
as
to
the
acquisition
of
the
plume
of
ostrich
feathers
by
the
black
prince
no
doubt
largely
accounts
for
the
idea
that
legend
as
has
been
already
shown
lacks
foundation
territorial
or
sovereign
arms
doubtless
would
be
subject
to
conquest
but
i
do
not
believe
that
because
in
battle
or
in
a
tournament
one
person
defeated
another
he
therefore
became
entitled
to
assume
of
his
own
motion
the
arms
of
the
man
he
had
vanquished
the
proposition
is
too
absurd
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
in
some
number
of
historic
cases
his
sovereign
has
subsequently
conferred
upon
the
victor
an
augmentation
which
has
closely
approximated
to
the
arms
of
his
victim
such
cases
occur
in
the
arms
of
the
clerkes

two
cases
are
known
of
augmentations
to
the
arms
of

the
arms
of
derry
were
augmented
by
the
arms
of
the
city
of
london
in
chief
when
after
its
fearful
siege
the
name
of
derry
was
changed
to
londonderry
to
commemorate
the
help
given
by
the
city

the
arms
of

added
to

after

this
by
the
way
is
a
striking
example
of
colour
upon
colour
the
field
of
the
coat
being
gules
there
are
many
grants
in
the
later
part
of
the
eighteenth

the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
centuries
recorded
in

which
at
first
sight
appear
to
be
augmentations
perhaps
they
are
rightly
so
termed
but
as
the
additions
usually
appear
to
be
granted
by
the
lyon
without
specific
royal
warrants
they
are
hardly
equivalent
to
the
english
ones
issued
during
the
same
period
many
ordinary
grants
made
in
england
which
have
borne
direct
reference
to
particular
achievements
of
the
grantee
have
been
by
the
grantees
and
their
descendants
wrongly
termed
augmentations
a
rough
and
ready
though
not
a
certain
test
is
to
imagine
the
coat
if
the
augmentation
be
removed
and
see
whether
it
remains
a
properly
balanced
design
few
of
such
coats
will
survive

made
to
a

to
make
it
a
different

when

is
founded
upon

ecclesiastical
heraldry
ecclesiastical
heraldry
has
nothing
like
the
importance
in
british
armory
that
it
possesses
elsewhere
it
may
be
said
to
consist
in
this
country
exclusively
of
the
official
arms
assigned
to
and
recorded
for
the
archiepiscopal
and
episcopal
sees
and
the
mitres
and
crosiers
which
are
added
to
the
shields
and
a
certain
number
of
ecclesiastical
symbols
which
occur
as
charges
in
days
there
were
of
course
the
many
religious
houses
which
used
armorial
emblems
but
with
the
suppression
of
the
monasteries
these
vanished
the
cardinal
hat
was
recognised
in
former
days
and
would
still
be
officially
certified
in
england
as
admittedly
correctly
displayed
above
the
arms
of
a
roman
cardinal
but
the
curious
and
intricate
development
of
other
varieties
of
the
ecclesiastical
hat
which
will
be
found
in
use
in
all
other
european
countries
is
not
known
to
british
armory
nor
has
the
english
college
of
arms
recognised
the
impersonal
arms
of
the
catholic
communities
those
arms
with
and
without
the
ecclesiastical
hats
play
a
conspicuous
part
in
continental
heraldry
it
is
difficult
to
assign
a
proper
value
or
a
definite
status
to
the
arms
of
the
abbeys
and
other
religious
houses
in
this
country
in
times
the
principal
in
fact
the
only
important
sources
of
information
concerning
them
are
the
impressions
of
seals
which
have
come
down
to
us
many
of
these
seals
show
the
effigies
of
saints
or
patrons
some
show
the
impersonal
arms
of
the
religious
order
to
whose
rule
the
community
conformed
some
the
personal
arms
of
the
official
of
the
moment
others
the
personal
arms
of
the
founder
in
other
cases
arms
presumably
those
of
the
particular
foundation
or
community
occur
but
in
such
cases
the
variations
in
design
are
so
marked
and
so
often
we
find
that
two
three
or
more
devices
are
used
indifferently
and
indiscriminately
that
one
is
forced
to
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
a
large
proportion
of
the
devices
in
use
though
armorial
in
character
had
no
greater
status
than
a
temporary
existence
as
seal
designs
they
distinctly
lack
the
unchanging
continuity
one
associates
with
armorial
bearings
but
whatever
their
status
may
once
have
been
they
have
now
completely
passed
out
of
being
and
may
well
be
allowed
to
rest
in
the
uncertainty
which
exists
concerning
them
the
interest
attaching
to
them
can
never
be
more
than
academic
in
character
and
limited
in
extent
the
larger
abbeys
the
abbots
of
which
were
anciently
summoned
to
parliament
as
lords
of
parliament
appear
to
have
adhered
rather
more
consistently
to
a
fixed
device
in
each
case
though
the
variations
of
design
are
very
noticeable
even
in
these
instances
a
list
of
them
will
be
found
in
the
vol
ii
the
suppression
of
the
monasteries
in
this
country
was
so
thorough
and
so
ruthless
that
the
contemporary
instances
of
abbatical
arms
remaining
to
us
from
which
deduction
as
to
armorial
rules
and
precedents
can
be
made
are
singularly
few
in
number
but
it
would
appear
that
the
abbot
impaled
the
arms
of
his
abbey
on
the
dexter
side
of
his
personal
arms
and
placed
his
mitre
above
the
shield
the
mitre
of
an
abbot
differed
from
that
of
a
bishop
inasmuch
as
it
had
no
labels
or
depending
from
within
it
the
abbot
used
a
crosier
which
doubtless
was
correctly
added
to
his
armorial
bearings
but
it
is
found
in
pale
behind
the
shield
in
bend
and
also
two
in
saltire
and
it
is
difficult
to
assert
which
was
the
most
correct
form
the
crosier
of
an
abbot
was
also
represented
with
the
crook
at
its
head
curved
inwards
the
terminal
point
of
the
crook
being
entirely
contained
within
the
hook
the
point
of
a
bishop
on
the
other
hand
was
turned
outwards
at
the
bottom
of
the
crook
the
difference
is
said
to
typify
the
distinction
between
the
confined
jurisdiction
of
the
abbot
which
was
limited
to
the
abbey
and
the
community
under
his
charge
and
the
more
open
and
wider
jurisdiction
of
the
bishop
although
this
distinction
has
been
much
disputed
as
regards
its
recognition
for
the
actual
crosiers
employed
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
is
very
generally
adhered
to
in
heraldic
representations
though
one
hesitates
to
assert
it
as
an
absolute
rule
the
official
arms
for
the
archiepiscopal
and
episcopal
sees
are
of
some
interest
with
the
single
exception
of
york
the
archiepiscopal
coats
of
arms
all
have
in
some
form
or
another
the
pallium
which
forms
part
of
an
archbishop
vestments
or
insignia
of
rank
but
it
is
now
very
generally
recognised
and
conceded
that
the
pallium
is
not
merely
a
charge
in
the
official
coat
for
any
specified
jurisdiction
but
is
itself
the
sign
of
the
rank
of
an
archbishop
of
the
same
character
and
status
as
is
the
mitre
the
pallium
being
displayed
upon
a
shield
as
a
matter
of
convenience
for
artistic
representation
this
view
of
the
case
has
been
much
strengthened
by
the
discovery
that
in
ancient
instances
of
the
archiepiscopal
arms
of
york
the
pallium
is
found
and
not
the
more
modern
coat
of
the
crown
and
keys
but
whether
the
pallium
is
to
be
still
so
considered
or
whether
under
english
armorial
law
it
must
now
be
merely
ranked
as
a
charge
in
an
ordinary
coat
of
arms
in
general
practice
it
is
accepted
as
the
latter
but
it
nevertheless
remains
a
point
of
very
considerable
interest
which
has
not
yet
been
elucidated
why
the
pallium
should
have
been
discarded
for
york
and
another
coat
of
arms
substituted
the
various
coats
used
by
the
archbishops
of
england
and
ireland
are
as
follows
azure
an
episcopal
staff
in
pale
or
and
ensigned
with
a
cross
patée
argent
surmounted
of
a
pall
of
the

charged
with
four
crosses

and

or
surmounted
by
a
pallium
of
the
second
edged
and
fringed
or
charged
with
four
crosses
formée
fitchée
sable
the
arms
of
this
archbishopric
are
the
same
as
those
of
armagh
only
with
five
crosses
charged
on
the
pallium
instead
of
four
the
arms
of
the
episcopal
sees
have
no
attribute
at
all
similar
to
the
charge
of
the
pallium
in
the
coat
of
an
archbishop
and
are
merely
so
many
different
coats
of
arms
the
shield
of
every
bishop
and
archbishop
is
surmounted
by
his
mitre
and
it
is
now
customary
to
admit
the
use
of
the
mitre
by
all
persons
holding
the
title
of
bishop
who
are
recognised
as
bishops
by
the
english
law
this
of
course
includes
colonial
and
suffragan
bishops
retired
bishops
and
bishops
of
the
episcopal
churches
in
scotland
and
in
ireland
it
is
a
moot
point
whether
the
bishops
of
the
episcopal
churches
in
ireland
and
in
scotland
are
entitled
to
make
use
of
the
official
arms
formerly
assigned
to
their
sees
at
a
period
when
those
churches
were
but
looking
at
the
matter
from
a
strictly
official
point
of
view
it
would
not
appear
that
they
are
any
longer
entitled
to
make
use
of
them
the
mitres
of
an
archbishop
and
of
a
bishop
in
spite
of
many
statements
to
the
contrary
are
exactly
identical
and
the
mistaken
idea
which
has
of
late
years
the
practice
is
really
quite
a
modern
one
encircled
the
rim
of
an
archbishop
mitre
with
the
circlet
of
a
coronet
is
absolutely
incorrect
there
are
several
forms
of
mitre
which
when
looked
upon
as
an
ecclesiastical
ornament
can
be
said
to
exist
but
from
the
heraldic
point
of
view
only
one
mitre
is
recognised
and
that
is
of
gold
the
labels
being
of
the
same
colour
the
jewelled
variety
is
incorrect
in
armorial
representations
though
the
science
of
armory
does
not
appear
to
have
enforced
any
particular
of
mitre
the
several
forms
of
the
mitre
to
which
allusion
has
just
been
made
refer
to
the
use
in
actual
practice
which
prevailed
in
england
and
still
holds
amongst
roman
catholic
bishops
at
the
present
day
these
are
three
in
number
the
precious
the
gold
and
the
simple
the
two
former
are
both
employed
at
a
pontifical
mass
being
alternately
assumed
at
different
parts
of
the
service
the
second
only
is
worn
at
such
rites
as
confirmation
while
the
third
which
is
purely
of
white
linen
is
confined
to
services
for
the
dead
and
on
good
friday
as
its
name
implies
the
first
of
these
is
of
cloth
of
gold
ornamented
to
a
greater
or
less
degree
with
jewels
while
the
second
though
likewise
of
cloth
of
gold
is
without
any
design
or
ornament
the
short
gothic
mitre
of
norman
days
has
now
given
place
to
the
modern
roman
one
an
alteration
which
with
its
great
height
and
arched
sides
can
hardly
perhaps
be
considered
an
artistic
improvement
some
individual
roman
catholic
bishops
at
the
present
day
however
in
england
at
any
rate
wear
mitres
more
allied
to
the
norman
and
gothic
shape
the
past
fifteen
or
so
years
have
seen
a
revival
though
in
a
purely
eclectic
and
unofficial
manner
of
the
of
the
mitre
by
church
of
england
bishops
where
this
has
been
and
is
being
done
the
older
form
of
mitre
has
been
adhered
to
though
from
the
informal
and
unofficial
nature
of
the
revival
no
rules
as
to
its
use
have
been
followed
but
only
individual
choice
at
the
recent
coronation
mitres
were
worn
which
they
undoubtedly
would
have
been
had
this
revival
now
alluded
to
been
made
authoritatively
all
bishops
and
archbishops
are
entitled
to
place
two
crosiers
in
saltire
behind
their
shields
archbishops
of
the
roman
catholic
church
have
continuously
placed
in
pale
behind
their
shields
what
is
known
as
the
archbishop
cross
in
actual
practice
the
cross
carried
before
an
archbishop
is
an
ordinary
one
with
one
transverse
piece
but
the
heraldic
archiepiscopal
cross
is
always
represented
as
a
double
cross
having
two
transverse
pieces
one
above
the
other
in
the
established
church
of
england
the
archiepiscopal
cross
as
in
the
roman
catholic
church
is
the
plain
variety
and
though
the
cross
is
never
officially
recognised
as
an
armorial
attribute
and
is
not
very
frequently
met
with
in
heraldic
representations
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
if
this
cross
is
used
to
typify
archiepiscopal
rank
it
should
be
heraldically
represented
with
the
double
arms
the
actual
cross
borne
before
archbishops
is
termed
the
provincial
cross
and
it
may
be
of
interest
to
here
state
that
the
bishops
of
rochester
are
the
official
to
the
archbishops
of
canterbury
to
the
foregoing
rules
there
is
one
notable
exception
the
bishop
of
durham
the
bishopric
of
durham
until
the
earlier
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
was
a
palatinate
and
in
earlier
times
the
bishops
of
durham
who
had
their
own
parliament
and
barons
of
the
palatinate
exercised
a
jurisdiction
and
regality
limited
in
extent
certainly
but
little
short
in
fact
or
effect
of
the
power
of
the
crown
if
ever
any
ecclesiastic
can
be
correctly
said
to
have
enjoyed
temporal
power
the
bishops
of
durham
can
be
so
described
the
of
the
continent
had
no
such
attributes
of
regality
vested
in
themselves
as
were
enjoyed
by
the
bishops
of
durham
these
were
in
truth
kings
within
their
bishoprics
and
even
to
the
present
day
though
modern
geographies
and
modern
social
legislation
have
divided
the
bishopric
into
other
divisions
one
still
hears
the
term
employed
of
within
or
without
the
bishopric
the
result
of
this
temporal
power
enjoyed
by
the
bishops
of
durham
is
seen
in
their
heraldic
achievement
in
place
of
the
two
crosiers
in
saltire
behind
the
shield
as
used
by
the
other
bishops
the
bishops
of
durham
place
a
sword
and
a
crosier
in
saltire
behind
their
shield
to
signify
both
their
temporal
and
spiritual
jurisdiction
the
mitre
of
the
bishop
of
durham
is
heraldically
represented
with
the
rim
encircled
by
a
ducal
coronet
and
it
has
thereby
become
usual
to
speak
of
the
coronetted
mitre
of
the
bishop
of
durham
but
it
should
be
clearly
borne
in
mind
that
the
coronet
formed
no
part
of
the
actual
mitre
and
probably
no
mitre
has
ever
existed
in
which
the
rim
has
been
encircled
by
a
coronet
but
the
bishops
of
durham
by
virtue
of
their
temporal
status
used
a
coronet
and
by
virtue
of
their
ecclesiastical
status
used
a
mitre
and
the
representation
of
both
of
these
at
one
and
the
same
time
has
resulted
in
the
coronet
being
placed
to
encircle
the
rim
of
the
mitre
the
result
has
been
that
heraldically
they
are
now
always
represented
as
one
and
the
same
article
it
is
of
course
from
this
coronetted
mitre
of
durham
that
the
wholly
inaccurate
idea
of
the
existence
of
coronet
on
the
mitre
of
an
archbishop
has
originated
apparently
the
humility
of
these
princes
of
the
church
has
not
been
sufficient
to
prevent
their
appropriating
the
peculiar
privileges
of
their
ecclesiastical
brother
of
lesser
rank
a
crest
is
never
used
with
a
mitre
or
ecclesiastical
hat
many
writers
deny
the
right
of
any
ecclesiastic
to
a
crest
some
deny
the
right
also
to
use
a
motto
but
this
restriction
has
no
general
acceptance
therefore
ecclesiastical
heraldry
in
britain
is
summed
up
in
its
recognition
of
the
cardinal
hat
the
official
coat
of
arms
for
ecclesiastical
purposes
the
ensigns
of
ecclesiastical
rank
above
alluded
to
viz
mitre
cross
and
crosier
ecclesiastical
heraldry
notably
in
connection
with
the
roman
church
in
other
countries
has
on
the
contrary
a
very
important
place
in
armorial
matters
in
addition
to
the
emblems
officially
recognised
for
english
heraldry
the
ecclesiastical
hat
is
in
constant
use
the
use
of
the
ecclesiastical
hat
is
very
general
outside
great
britain
and
affords
one
of
the
few
instances
where
the
rules
governing
heraldic
usages
are
identical
throughout
the
continent
this
curious
unanimity
is
the
more
remarkable
because
it
was
not
until
the
seventeenth
century
that
the
rather
intricate
rules
concerning
the
colours
of
the
hats
used
for
different
ranks
and
the
number
of
tassels
came
into
vogue
other
than
the
occasional
recognition
of
the
cardinal
hat
in
former
days
the
only
british
official
instance
of
the
use
of
the
ecclesiastical
hat
is
met
with
in
the
case
of
the
very
recent
matriculation
of
arms
in
lyon
register
to
right
rev
æneas
chisholm
the
present
roman
catholic
bishop
of
aberdeen
i
frankly
admit
i
am
unaware
why
the
ecclesiastical
hat
assigned
to
the
bishop
in
the
official
matriculation
of
his
arms
has
ten
tassels
on
either
side
the
continental
usage
would
assign
him
but
six
and
english
armory
has
no
rules
of
its
own
which
can
be
quoted
in
opposition
thereto
save
as
an
acceptance
of
roman
regulations
roman
holy
orders
it
should
not
be
forgotten
are
recognised
by
the
english
common
law
to
the
extent
that
a
roman
catholic
priest
is
not
reordained
if
he
becomes
an
anglican
clergyman
the
heraldic
ecclesiastical
hat
of
a
bishop
has
no
existence
with
us
and
the
roman
regulations
would
give
him
but
six
tassels
the
mitre
is
to
be
met
with
as
a
charge
and
as
a
crest
for
instance
in
the
case
of
barclay
and
berkeley

mitre

labelled
and
garnished

charged

in

a
mitre
gules
charged
with
a
chevron
argent
fimbriated

thereon
three

the

can
hardly
be
termed
exclusively
ecclesiastical
but
a
curious
figure
of
this
nature
is
to
be
met
with
in
the
arms
recently
granted
to
the
borough
of
southwark
it
was
undoubtedly
taken
from
the
device
used
in
southwark
before
its
incorporation
though
as
there
were
many
bodies
who
adopted
it
in
that
neighbourhood
it
is
difficult
to
assign
it
to
a
specific
origin
pastoral
staves
and
are
elsewhere
referred
to
and
the
figures
of
saints
and
ecclesiastics
are
mentioned
in
the
chapter
on
the
human
figure
the
emblems
of
the
saints
which
appear
to
have
received
a
certain
amount
of
official
recognition
both
ecclesiastical
and
heraldic
supply
the
origin
of
many
other
charges
not
in
themselves
heraldic
an
instance
of
this
kind
will
be
found
in
the
sword
of
paul
which
figures
on
the
shield
of
london
the
cross
of
cuthbert
which
has
been
adopted
in
the
unauthorised
coat
for
the
see
of

the
keys
of
peter
which
figure
in
many
ecclesiastical
coats
are
other
examples

of

constantly
to
be
met
with

xl
hatchments
a
custom
formerly
prevailed
in
england
which
at
one
time
was
of
very
considerable
importance
this
was
the
setting
up
of
a
hatchment
after
a
death
no
instances
of
hatchments
of
a
very
early
date
as
far
as
i
am
aware
are
to
be
met
with
and
it
is
probably
a
correct
conclusion
that
the
custom
originating
rather
earlier
came
into
vogue
in
england
during
the
seventeenth
century
and
reached
its
height
in
the
eighteenth
it
doubtless
originated
in
the
carrying
of
ceremonial
shields
and
helmets
afterwards
left
in
the
church
at
funerals
in
the
sixteenth
century
and
in
the
earlier
practice
of
setting
up
in
the
church
the
actual
shield
of
a
deceased
person
the
cessation
of
the
ceremonial
funeral
no
doubt
led
to
the
cult
of
the
hatchment
hatchments
can
not
be
said
even
yet
to
have
come
entirely
to
an
end
but
instances
of
their
use
are
nowadays
extremely
rare
and
since
the
early
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
practice
has
been
steadily
declining
and
at
the
present
time
it
is
seldom
indeed
that
one
sees
a
hatchment
the
word
hatchment
is
of
course
a
corruption
of
the
term
achievement
this
being
the
heraldic
term
implying
an
emblazonment
of
the
full
armorial
bearings
of
any
person
the
manner
of
use
was
as
follows
immediately
upon
the
death
of
a
person
of
any
social
position
a
hatchment
of
his
or
her
arms
was
set
up
over
the
entrance
to
his
house
which
remained
there
for
twelve
months
during
the
period
of
mourning
it
was
then
taken
down
from
the
house
and
removed
to
the
church
where
it
was
set
up
in
perpetuity
there
are
few
churches
of
any
age
in
this
country
which
do
not
boast
one
or
more
of
these
hatchments
and
some
are
rich
in
their
possession
those
now
remaining
for
example
in
chad
church
in
shrewsbury
must
number
i
imagine
over
a
hundred
there
does
not
appear
to
have
been
any
obligation
upon
a
clergyman
either
to
permit
their
erection
or
to
allow
them
to
remain
for
any
specified
period
in
some
churches
they
have
been
discarded
and
relegated
to
the
vestry
to
the
or
to
the
whilst
in
others
they
have
been
carefully
preserved
the
hatchment
was
a
frame
painted
black
and
enclosing
a
painting
in
oils
upon
wood
or
more
frequently
canvas
of
the
full
armorial
bearings
of
the
deceased
person
the
frame
was
usually
about
five
feet
six
in
height
and
the
rules
for
the
display
of
arms
upon
hatchments
afford
an
interesting
set
of
regulations
which
may
be
applied
to
other
heraldic
emblazonments
the
chief
point
however
concerning
a
hatchment
and
also
the
one
in
which
it
differs
from
an
ordinary
armorial
emblazonment
lay
in
the
colour
of
the
groundwork
upon
which
the
armorial
bearings
were
painted
for
an
unmarried
person
the
whole
of
the
groundwork
was
black
but
for
a
husband
or
wife
half
was
black
and
half
white
the
groundwork
behind
the
arms
of
the
deceased
person
being
black
and
of
the
surviving
partner
in
matrimony
white
the
background
for
a
widow
or
widower
was
entirely
black
chapter

to

our
jack
the

colours
and
the

banner
which
last
title
precise
heraldry
usually
adopts
in
patriotic
songs
it
is
toasted
as
the
red
white
and
blue
whilst
in
the
services
men
affectionately
allude
to
it
as
the
dear
old
duster
but
britons
at
large
cling
to
the
title
which
heads
this
chapter
to
them
it
is
union
union
obviously
because
it
unites
three
emblems
of
tutelar
saints
on
one
flag
and
thereby
denotes
the
union
of
three
peoples
under
one
sovereign
it
is
the
motto
juncta
in
rendered
in
bunting
jack
two
theories
are
propounded
one
fanciful
the
other
probable
some
say
jack
is
the
anglicised
form
of
jacques
which
is
the
french
signature
of
james
in
whose
reign
and
by
whose
command
the
first
union
flag
was
called
into
being
against
this
at
least
three
reasons
may
justly
be
urged
the
term
does
not
appear
so
far
as
we
can
discover
in
any
warrant
referring
to
the
jacobean
flag
of
it
is
rather
in
later
documents
that
this
term
occurs
if
the
earliest
union
flag
be
a
just
because
it
is
the
creation
of
james
then
surely
it
follows
that
to
be
consistent
later
union
flags
the
creations
of
later
sovereigns
should
have
borne
those
sovereigns
names
for
example
union
union
the
english
way
of
pronouncing
jacques
is
not
and
probably
never
was
but
the
other
and
more
feasible
theory
is
as
follows
the
term
jaque
de
was
borrowed
from
the
french
and
referred
to
any
jacket
or
coat
on
which
especially
heraldic
emblems
were
blazoned
in
days
long
prior
to
those
of
the
first
stuart
king
mention
is
made
of
whytte
cotes
with
red
crosses
worn
by
shyppesmen
and
men
of
the
cette
of
london
from
which
sentence
we
learn
that
the
emblem
of
the
nation
tutelar
saint
was
as
in
yet
earlier
crusaders
days
a
emblem
when
such
emblem
or
emblems
were
transferred
to
a
flag
the
term
may
well
in
course
of
time
have
been
also
applied
to
that
flag
as
previously
to
the
jacket
glance
now
at
the
story
of
those
orders
in
council
which
created
the
various
union
flags
the
very
union
of
the
two
kingdoms
of
england
and
scotland
seems
to
have
accentuated
the
pettier
national
jealousies
so
that
southrons
annoyed
northerners
by
hoisting
the
george
above
the
andrew
and
the
scotchmen
retaliated
by
a
species
of
the
king
sought
to
allay
these
quarrels
by
creating
a
british
as
other
than
a
purely
english
or
scottish
flag
but
let
the
proclamation
speak
for
itself
the
some
differences
hath
arisen
between
our
subjects
of
south
and
north
britaine
travelling
by
seas
about
the
bearing
of
their
flagges
for
the
avoiding
of
all
contentions
hereafter
wee
have
with
the
advice
of
our
councill
ordered
that
from
henceforth
all
our
subjects
of
this
isle
and
kingdome
of
great
britaine
and
all
our
members
thereof
shall
beare
in
their
the
red
crosse
commonly
called
george
crosse
and
the
white
crosse
commonly
called
andrew
crosse
joyned
together
according
to
the
forme
made
by
our
heralds
and
sent
by
us
to
our
admerall
to
be
published
to
our
subjects
and
in
their
our
subjects
of
south
britaine
shall
weare
the
red
crosse
onely
as
they
were
wont
and
our
subjects
of
north
britaine
in
their
the
white
crosse
onely
as
they
were
this
attempt
at
conciliating
differences
deserved
but
did
not
win
success
king
owne
deemed
themselves
slighted
since
all
vessels
were
treated
alike
in
this
matter
and
so
persistent
was
the
agitation
that
at
last
in
charles
i
reign
another
proclamation
was
issued
the
honour
of
oure
shipps
in
oure
navie
whereby
those
ships
alone
had
the
right
of
hoisting
union
the
days
of
the
commonwealth
brought
another
change
for
with
the
king
the
king
flag
disappeared
the
protector
caused
two
new
flags
to
be
made
viz
great
a
flag
little
used
however
although
it
figured
at
his
funeral
obsequies
and
which
may
be
thus
blazoned
and
the
a
harp
or
for
ireland
over
all
on
an
inescutcheon
of
pretence
sable
a
lion
rampant
for
the
protector
personal
arms
and
commonwealth
which
latter
parliament
treated
as
the
paramount
flag
the
most
interesting
features
of
this
flag
are
that
it
was
of
three
kinds
one
red
one
white
one
blue
and
that
ireland
but
not
scotland
had
a
place
on
its
folds
when
the
king
came
to
his
own
again
yet
another
change
was
witnessed
by
this
proclamation
ships
in
the
navy
were
to
carry
and
all
merchantmen
whilst
these
latter
vessels
were
also
to
wear
red
ensign
with
the
george
on
a
passing
on
we
reach
the
days
of
queen
anne
who
as
soon
as
the
union
of
the
two
parliaments
was
accomplished
issued
a
famous
proclamation

quoted

of
union
had
agreed
should
be
in
such
a
manner
as
we
should
think
and
what
that
manner
was
is
on
the
in
the
shape
of
a
sketch
but
further
in
place
of
the
being
placed
on
the
canton
of
the
of
charles
ii
itself
the
ensign
the
harp
the
proclamation
ordered
the
as
a
canton
and
finally
this
new
red
ensign
was
confined
to
the
merchant
ships
whilst
was
reserved
for
the
use
of
the
navy
unless
by
particular
warrant
thus
things
continued
until
the
union
of
ireland
with
england
and
scotland

remarkable

amongst

as
a
blending
of
crosses
and
crosses

also

an
emblem
of
the
union
of
two
or
more
countries
yet
it
is
not
unique
for
the
flags
of
denmark

and
norway
have
a
somewhat
similar
story
to
tell
the
last
two
countries
separated
at
different
dates
from
denmark
and
then
together
formed
a
united
scandinavian
kingdom
in
separating
they
each
took
to
themselves
a
separate
flag
and
again
in
uniting
they
called
into
being
a
union
banner
how
they
treated
these
changes
fig
will
illustrate
notwithstanding
these
acts
of
union
both
scandinavians
and
britons
have
had
and
we
still
have
differences
over
these
union
flags
whilst
however
they
based
their
protests
on
the
sentiment
of
independence
we
ground
our
grumblings
on
questions
of
heraldic
precedence
and
of
the
interpretation
of
verbal
blazons
leaving
our
neighbours
to
settle
their
differences
let
us
examine
our
own
take
the
subject
of
precedence
very
early
in
the
flag
history
scotsmen
were
indignant
because
the
andrew
was
not
placed
over
the
george
all
kinds
of
variations
have
been
suggested
to
lessen
this
crux
of
precedence
but
such
attempts
must
plainly
be
in
vain
do
what
you
will
some
kind
of
precedence
is
unavoidable
the
then
as
representing
the
paramount
partner
occupies
the
centre
of
the
flag
whilst
the
as
senior
in
partnership
to
the
is
placed
the
patrick
in
the
first
although
throughout
it
is
counterchanged
the
words
in
italic
are
important
for
when
the
order
is
reversed
then
that
particular
flag
is
flying
upside
down
illustration
fig
the
union
flag
of
the
mode
of
procedure
in
creating
flags
has
been
much
the
same
from
one
reign
to
another
briefly
it
is
this
the
sovereign
seeks
the
advice
of
and
receives
a
report
from
the
lords
of
the
privy
council
these
councillors
are
by
the
king
of
arms
and
heralds
with
diverse
drafts
prepared
by
a
decision
being
arrived
at
an
order
in
council
followed
by
a
royal
proclamation
makes
known
the
character
of
the
flag
in
both
order
and
proclamation
it
is
usual
to
make
reference
to
the
verbal
blazon
and
to
form
made
by
our
thus
there
are
three
agents
recognised
the
sovereign
the
fountain
of
all
honours
the
heralds
who
authoritatively
blazon
outline
and
register
all
achievements
and
the
naval
authority
as
that
in
which
are
vested
the
duty
and
the
power
of
seeing
the
actual
bunting
properly
made
up
and
properly
flown
illustration
fig
the
union
flag
of
in
keeping
with
this
the
general
mode
of
procedure
the
proclamations
demand
our
attention
the
proclamation
of
james
a
high
official
of
the
college
of
arms
informs
us
that
neither
verbal
blazon
nor
drawing
of
the
first
union
flag
is
extant
on
the
other
hand
in
the
proclamations
of
and
we
have
both
blazon
and
drawing
the
blazon
has
already
been
given
of
the
flag
which
is
the
one
most
needing
a
verbal
blazon
and
the
drawings
of
both
flags
we
here
produce
figs
and
these
drawings
though
slightly
reduced
in
these
pages
are
most
careful
copies
of
the
copies
supplied
to
us
by
the
official
already
alluded
to
in
forwarding
them
he
writes
are
not
drawn
to
and
he
adds
further
on
are
exactly
the
same
size
as
recorded
in
our
so
then
we
have
in
these
two
drawings
the
heralds
interpretation
the
of
their
own
verbal
blazon
now
comes
the
admiralty
part
of
the
work
in
the
admiralty
regulations
we
have
a
relative
to
the
origin
of
the
union
flag
in
its
present
in
this
there
is
a
brief
history
of
the
changes
made
in
the
flag
from
time
to
time
with
quotations
from
the
warrants
together
with
the
verbal
blazon
and
two
coloured
drawings
figs
and
the
admiralty
has
also
appended
to
the
memorandum
the
following
interesting
and
ingeniously
worked
out
of
proportions
adapted
for
a
flag
feet
by
presumably
this
table
forms
the
basis
upon
which
all
union
flags
are
made
up
under
admiralty
supervision

the
student
of
heraldry
will
observe
that
this
table
is
based
on
the
proportions
of
the
ordinaries
and
figuring
on
the
flag
as
those
proportions
are
regulated
by
english
rules
of
armory
these
rules
give
a
cross
as
a
saltire
as
a
fimbriation
about
of
the
flag
width
by
the
way
we
notice
here
yet
only
to
dismiss
it
as
hypercritical
the
objection
taken
to
the
employment
in
the
verbal
blazon
of
of
the
term
to
our
mind
this
objection
seems
a
storm
in
a
teacup
further
it
is
always
admissible
in
armory
to
lessen
the
size
of
charges
when
these
crowd
a
field
and
although
we
are
fully
aware
that
the
laws
of
armory
are
not
always
nor
all
of
them
applied
to
flags
yet
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
show
that
the
heralds
and
the
admiralty
did
recognise
the
cases
of
shields
and
flags
to
be
somewhat
analogous
but
there
are
two
features
in
admiralty
which
can
not
but
arrest
the
attention
of
all
those
who
have
made
a
study
of
armory
the
one
is
that
the
the
fimbriations
have
different
proportions
given
to
them
although
they
are
repetitions
of
the
same
and
also
seem
guarded
against
such
treatment
by
the
very
wording
of
the
blazon
and
by
the
practice
usual
in
such
cases
and
the
other
is
that
after
counterchanging
the
saltires
the
patrick
is
attenuated
by
having
its
fimbriation
taken
off
its
own
field
instead
as
the
common
custom
is
off
the
field
of
the
flag
all
warrants
dealing
with
flags
provide
for
their
being
flown
queen
anne
proclamation
is
apparently
the
first
that
adds
and
gradually
reserve
for
the
royal
navy
or
fighting
ships
the
honour
of
alone
bearing
the
union
jack
the
accompanying
diagram
shows
at
a
glance
the
changes
made
by
the
several
proclamations
the
latest
word
on
this
subject
is
the
merchant
shipping
colours
act
of
queen
victoria
this
acts
sets
forth
among
other
things
that
red
ensign
usually
worn
by
merchant
ships
without
any
defacement
or
modification
whatsoever
is
hereby
declared
to
be
the
proper

belonging

any
british
subject

in
the
case
of
her
ships
or

in

time
being
allowed

proof
of
ancestry
if
any
heraldic
term
has
been
misunderstood
in
this
country
is
that
term
one
hears
claimed
right
and
left
whereas
in
british
armory
it
is
only
on
the
very
rarest
occasions
that
proof
of
it
can
be
made
in
england
there
is
not
and
never
has
been
for
any
purpose
a
real
test
of
blood
by
the
statutes
of
various
orders
of
knighthood
esquires
of
knights
of
those
orders
are
required
to
show
that
their
grandparents
were
of
gentle
birth
and
entitled
to
bear
arms
and
a
popular
belief
exists
that
knights
of
justice
of
the
order
of
the
hospital
of
john
of
jerusalem
in
england
need
to
establish
some
test
of
birth
the
wording
of
the
statute
however
is
very
loose
and
vague
and
in
fact
judging
from
the
names
and
arms
of
some
of
the
knights
must
be
pretty
generally
ignored
but
peer
or
alike
need
pass
no
test
of
birth
the
present
state
of
affairs
in
this
country
is
the
natural
outcome
of
the
custom
of
society
which
always
recognises
the
wife
as
of
the
husband
status
whatever
may
have
been
her
antecedents
unless
the
discrepancy
is
too
glaring
to
be
overlooked
in
england
few
indeed
care
or
question
whether
this
person
or
that
person
has
even
a
coat
of
arms
and
in
the
decision
of
society
upon
a
given
question
as
to
whether
this
person
or
the
other
has
married
beneath
himself
the
judgment
results
solely
from
the
circle
in
which
the
wife
and
her
people
move
by
many
this
curious
result
is
claimed
as
an
example
of
and
as
a
telling
instance
to
demonstrate
the
superiority
of
the
english
race
as
evidenced
by
the
equality
which
this
country
concedes
between
titled
and
untitled
classes
between
official
and
unofficial
personages
between
the
and
the
mercantile
communities
but
such
a
conclusion
is
most
superficial
we
draw
no
distinction
and
rightly
so
between
titled
and
untitled
amongst
the
few
remaining
families
who
have
held
and
owned
their
lands
for
many
generations
but
outside
this
class
the
confusion
is
great
and
to
a
close
observer
it
is
plainly
enough
apparent
that
great
distinctions
are
drawn
but
they
are
often
mistaken
ones
that
the
rigid
and
definite
dividing
line
between
patrician
and
plebeian
which
still
exists
so
much
more
markedly
upon
the
continent
can
only
be
traced
most
sketchily
in
this
country
is
due
to
two
causes
the
fact
that
in
early
days
when
society
was
slowly
evolving
itself
many
younger
sons
of
gentle
families
embarked
upon
commercial
careers
natural
family
affection
because
of
such
action
preventing
a
rigid
exclusion
from
the
ranks
of
society
of
every
one
tainted
by
commerce
the
absence
in
this
country
of
any
equivalent
of
the
patent
distinguishing
marks
de
van
or
von
which
exist
among
our
neighbours
in
europe
the
result
has
been
that
in
england
there
is
no
possible
way
short
of
specific
genealogical
investigation
in
which
it
can
be
ascertained
whether
any
given
person
is
of
gentle
birth
and
the
corollary
of
this
fact
is
that
any
real
test
is
ignored
there
are
few
families
in
this
country
outside
the
roman
catholic
aristocracy
whose
marriages
are
not
quite
so
haphazard
as
are
those
of
other
people
who
can
show
that
all
their
sixteen
were
in
their
own
right
entitled
to
bear
arms
that
is
the
true
definition
of
the
proof
of
in
other
words
