introduction
the
is
a
form
of
fiction
in
which
the
french
have
always
delighted
and
in
which
they
have
always
excelled
from
the
days
of
the
and
the
past
the
periods
of
la
fontaine
and
voltaire
down
to
the
present
the
is
a
tale
something
more
than
a
sketch
it
may
be
and
something
less
than
a
short
story
in
verse
it
is
at
times
but
a
mere
rhymed
anecdote
or
it
may
attain
almost
to
the
direct
swiftness
of
a
ballad
the
are
most
of
them
if
not
all
and
so
are
some
of
the
of
a
wayside
the
tales
of
prior
were
written
in
imitation
of
the
french
en
and
that
likewise
was
the
model
of
more
than
one
of
the
lively
narrative
poems
of
austin
dobson
no
one
has
succeeded
more
abundantly
in
the
en
than
coppée
where
was
there
ever
anything
better
of
its
kind
than
de
la
balle
that
gentle
portrait
of
the
infant
phenomenon
framed
in
a
chain
of
occasional
gibes
at
the
sordid
ways
of
theatrical
managers
and
at
their
hostility
towards
poetic
plays
where
is
there
anything
of
a
more
simple
pathos
than
that
story
of
a
sailor
son
whom
the
widowed
mother
strives
vainly
to
keep
from
the
cruel
waves
that
killed
his
father
it
is
worthy
of
a
parenthesis
that
although
the
ship
coppée
loves
best
is
that
which
sails
the
blue
shield
of
the
city
of
paris
he
knows
the
sea
also
and
he
depicts
sailors
with
affectionate
fidelity
but
whether
at
the
by
chance
or
more
often
in
the
streets
of
the
city
the
poet
seeks
out
for
the
subject
of
his
story
some
incident
of
daily
occurrence
made
significant
by
his
interpretation
he
chooses
some
character
enough
but
made
firmer
by
conflict
with
evil
and
by
victory
over
self
those
whom
he
puts
into
his
poems
are
still
the
humble
the
forgotten
the
neglected
the
unknown
and
it
is
the
feelings
and
the
struggles
of
these
that
he
tells
us
with
no
maudlin
sentimentality
and
with
no
dead
set
at
our
sensibilities
the
stowe
gave
to
tom
would
serve
to
cover
most
of
coppée
either
in
prose
or
verse
they
are
nearly
all
pictures
of
among
the
but
there
is
no
forcing
of
the
note
in
his
painting
of
poverty
and
labor
there
is
no
harsh
juxtaposition
of
the
blacks
and
the
whites
the
tone
is
always
manly
and
wholesome
marchande
de
and
the
other
little
masterpieces
of
in
verse
are
unfortunately
untranslatable
as
are
all
poems
but
a
lyric
or
two
now
and
then
by
a
happy
accident
a
translated
poem
is
a
boiled
strawberry
as
some
one
once
put
it
brutally
but
the
tales
which
coppée
has
written
in
prose
a
true
poet
prose
nervous
vigorous
flexible
and
firm
these
can
be
englished
by
taking
thought
and
time
and
pains
without
which
a
translation
is
always
a
betrayal
ten
of
these
tales
have
been
rendered
into
english
by
mr
learned
and
the
ten
chosen
for
translation
are
among
the
best
of
the
two
score
and
more
of
coppée
en
these
ten
tales
are
fairly
representative
of
his
range
and
variety
compare
for
example
the
passion
in
the
foster
sister
pure
burning
and
fatal
with
the
black
forest
of
the
sabots
of
little
wolff
contrast
the
touching
pathos
of
the
substitute
poignant
in
his
magnificent
by
which
the
man
who
has
conquered
his
shameful
past
goes
back
willingly
to
the
horrible
life
he
has
fled
from
that
he
may
save
from
a
like
degradation
and
from
an
inevitable
moral
decay
the
one
friend
he
has
in
the
world
all
unworthy
as
this
friend
is
contrast
this
with
the
story
of
the
gigantic
deeds
my
friend
meurtrier
boasts
about
unceasingly
not
knowing
that
he
has
been
discovered
in
his
little
round
of
daily
domestic
duties
making
the
coffee
of
his
good
old
mother
and
taking
her
poodle
out
for
a
walk
among
these
ten
there
are
tales
of
all
sorts
from
the
tragic
adventure
of
an
accident
to
the
pendent
portraits
of
the
two
clowns
cutting
in
its
sarcasm
but
not
bitter
from
the
captain
vices
which
suggests
at
once
george
eliot
and
austin
of
to
the
sombre
revery
of
the
poet
at
table
a
sudden
and
searching
light
cast
on
the
labor
and
misery
which
underlies
the
luxury
of
our
complex
modern
existence
like
at
table
a
dramatic
funeral
is
a
picture
more
than
it
is
a
story
it
is
a
marvellous
reproduction
of
the
factitious
emotion
of
the
stage
folk
who
are
prone
to
overact
even
their
own
griefs
and
joys
a
dramatic
funeral
seems
to
me
always
as
though
it
might
be
a
painting
of
jean
beraud
that
most
parisian
of
artists
just
as
certain
stories
of
guy
de
maupassant
inevitably
suggest
the
bold
freedom
of
sketches
in
an
ardent
admirer
of
the
author
of
the
stories
in
odd
has
protested
to
me
that
coppée
is
not
an
etcher
like
de
maupassant
but
rather
a
painter
in
and
why
not
thus
might
we
call
alphonse
daudet
an
artist
in
pastels
so
adroitly
does
he
suggest
the
very
bloom
of
color
no
doubt
coppée
have
not
the
sharpness
of
de
maupassant
nor
the
brilliancy
of
daudet
but
what
of
it
they
have
qualities
of
their
own
they
have
sympathy
poetry
and
a
power
of
suggesting
pictures
not
exceeded
i
think
by
those
of
either
de
maupassant
or
daudet
coppée
street
views
in
paris
his
interiors
his
impressionist
sketches
of
life
under
the
shadows
of
notre
dame
are
convincingly
successful
they
are
intensely
to
be
enjoyed
by
those
of
us
who
take
the
same
keen
delight
in
the
varied
phases
of
life
in
new
york
they
are
not
to
my
mind
really
rivalled
either
by
those
of
de
maupassant
who
is
a
norman
by
birth
and
a
nomad
by
choice
or
by
those
of
daudet
who
is
a
native
of
provence
although
now
for
thirty
years
a
resident
of
paris
coppée
is
a
parisian
from
his
youth
up
and
even
in
prose
he
is
a
poet
perhaps
this
is
why
his
pictures
of
paris
are
unsurpassable
in
their
felicity
and
in
their
verity
it
may
be
fancy
but
i
seem
to
see
also
a
finer
morality
in
work
than
in
de
maupassant
or
in
daudet
or
in
that
of
almost
any
other
of
the
parisian
of
in
his
tales
we
breathe
a
purer
moral
atmosphere
more
wholesome
and
more
bracing
it
is
not
that
coppée
probably
thinks
of
ethics
rather
than
æsthetics
in
this
respect
his
attitude
is
undoubtedly
that
of
the
others
there
is
no
sermon
in
his
song
or
at
least
none
for
those
who
will
not
seek
it
for
themselves
there
is
never
a
hint
of
a
preachment
but
for
all
that
i
have
found
in
his
work
a
trace
of
the
tonic
morality
which
inheres
in
molière
for
example
also
a
parisian
by
birth
and
also
in
rabelais
despite
his
disguising
grossness
this
finer
morality
comes
possibly
from
a
wider
and
a
deeper
survey
of
the
universe
and
it
is
as
different
as
possible
from
the
morality
which
is
externally
applied
and
which
always
punishes
the
villain
in
the
fifth
act
it
is
of
good
augury
for
our
own
letters
that
the
best
french
fiction
of
is
getting
itself
translated
in
the
united
states
and
that
the
liking
for
it
is
growing
apace
fiction
is
more
consciously
an
art
in
france
than
anywhere
else
perhaps
partly
because
the
french
are
now
foremost
in
nearly
all
forms
of
artistic
endeavor
in
the
short
story
especially
in
the
tale
in
the
their
supremacy
is
incontestable
and
their
skill
is
shown
and
their
æsthetic
instinct
exemplified
partly
in
the
sense
of
form
in
the
constructive
method
which
underlies
the
best
short
stories
however
trifling
these
may
appear
to
be
and
partly
in
the
rigorous
suppression
of
due
in
a
measure
it
may
be
to
the
example
of
mérimee
that
is
an
example
we
in
america
may
study
to
advantage
and
from
the
men
who
are
writing
fiction
in
france
we
may
gain
much
from
the
british
fiction
of
this
last
quarter
of
the
nineteenth
century
little
can
be
learned
by
any
one
less
by
us
americans
in
whom
the
english
tradition
is
still
dominant
when
we
look
to
france
for
an
exemplar
we
may
find
a
model
of
value
but
when
we
copy
an
englishman
we
are
but
echoing
our
own
faults
the
truth
is
said
lowell
in
his
memorable
essay
a
certain
condescension
in
the
truth
is
that
we
are
worth
nothing
except
so
far
as
we
have
disinfected
ourselves

anglicism

mercadier
years
of
service
campaigns
and

installed
himself
when
he
was
retired
on
a
pension
it
was
quite
like

those
other

which
solicit
without
obtaining
it
a
branch
of
the
railway
just
as
if
it
were
not
the
sole
dissipation

the

go
every
day
at
the
same
hour
to
the
place

fontaine
to
see
the
diligence
come
in
at
full
gallop
with
its
gay
cracking
of
the
whips
and
clang
of
bells
it
was
a
place
of
three
thousand
inhabitants
ambitiously
denominated
souls
in
the
statistical
tables
and
was
exceedingly
proud
of
its
title
of
chief
city
of
the
canton
it
had
ramparts
planted
with
trees

pretty
river
with
good
fishing

church

of

flamboyant
gothic

by
a
frightful
station

cross
brought
directly
from
the
quarter
of
saint
sulpice
every
monday
its
market
was
gay
with
great
red
and
blue
umbrellas
and
countrymen
filled
its
streets
in
carts
and
carriages
but
for
the
rest
of
the
week
it
retired
with
delight
into
that
silence
and
solitude
which
made
it
so
dear
to
its
rustic
population
its
streets
were
paved
with
through
the
windows
of
the
one
could
see
samplers
and
under
glass
domes
and
through
the
gates

naturally
called
the
shield
of
france
and
the
made
rhymed
acrostics
for
the
ladies
of
society
captain
mercadier
had
chosen
that
place
of
retreat
for
the
simple
reason
that
he
had
been
born
there
and
because
in
his
noisy
childhood
he
had
pulled
down
the
signs
and
plugged
up
the
he
returned
there
to
find
neither
relations
nor
friends
nor
acquaintances
and
the
recollections
of
his
youth
recalled
only
the
angry
faces
of
who
shook
their
fists
at
him
from
the
a
catechism
which
threatened
him
with
hell
a
school
which
predicted
the
scaffold
and
finally
his
departure
for
his
regiment
hastened
by
a
paternal
malediction
for
the
captain
was
not
a
saintly
man
the
old
record
of
his
punishment
was
black
with
days
in
the
inflicted
for
breaches
of
discipline
absences
from
and
nocturnal
uproars
in
the
he
had
often
narrowly
escaped
losing
his
stripes
as
a
corporal
or
a
sergeant
and
he
needed
all
the
chance
all
the
license
of
a
campaigning
life
to
gain
his
first
epaulet
firm
and
brave
soldier
he
had
passed
almost
all
his
life
in
algiers
at
that
time
when
our
foot
soldiers
wore
the
high
shako
white
and
huge
he
had
had
lamoricière
for
commander
the
due
de
nemours
near
whom
he
received
his
first
wound
had
decorated
him
and
when
he
was
père
bugrand
had
called
him
by
his
name
and
pulled
his
ears
he
had
been
a
prisoner
of
bearing
the
scar
of
a
yataghan
stroke
on
his
neck
of
one
ball
in
his
shoulder
and
another
in
his
chest
and
notwithstanding
absinthe
duels
debts
of
play
and
jewesses
he
fairly
won
with
the
point
of
the
bayonet
and
sabre
his
grade
of
captain
in
the
first
regiment
of
captain
mercadier
years
of
service
campaigns
and
three
wounds
had
just
retired
on
his
pension
not
quite
two
thousand
francs
which
joined
to
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
francs
from
his
cross
placed
him
in
that
estate
of
honorable
penury
which
the
state
reserves
for
its
old
servants
his
entry
into
his
natal
city
was
without
ostentation
he
arrived
one
morning
on
the
imperiale
of
the
diligence
chewing
an
extinguished
cigar
and
already
on
good
terms
with
the
conductor
to
whom
during
his
journey
he
had
related
the
passage
of
the
porte
de
fer
full
of
indulgence
moreover
for
the
distractions
of
his
auditor
who
often
interrupted
the
recital
by
some
oath
or
epithet
addressed
to
the
off
mare
when
the
diligence
stopped
he
threw
on
the
sidewalk
his
old
valise
covered
with
railway
placards
as
numerous
as
the
changes
of
garrison
that
its
proprietor
had
made
and
the
idlers
of
the
neighborhood
were
astonished
to
see
a
man
with
a
decoration
a
rare
thing
in
the
province
offer
a
glass
of
wine
to
the
coachman
at
the
bar
of
an
inn
near
by
he
installed
himself
at
once
in
a
house
in
the
outskirts
where
two
captive
cows
lowed
and
fowls
and
ducks
passed
and
repassed
through
the
a
furnished
chamber
was
to
let
preceded
by
a
woman
the
captain
climbed
the
with
its
great
wooden
balusters
perfumed
by
a
strong
odor
of
the
stable
and
reached
a
great
tiled
room
whose
walls
were
covered
with
a
bizarre
paper
representing
printed
in
blue
on
a
white
background
and
repeated
infinitely
the
picture
of
joseph
poniatowski
crossing
the
elster
on
his
horse
this
monotonous
decoration
recalling
nevertheless
our
military
glories
fascinated
the
captain
without
doubt
for
without
concerning
himself
with
the
uncomfortable
straw
chairs
the
walnut
furniture
or
the
little
bed
with
its
yellowed
curtain
he
took
the
room
without
hesitation
a
quarter
of
an
hour
was
enough
to
empty
his
trunk
hang
up
his
clothes
put
his
boots
in
a
corner
and
ornament
the
wall
with
a
trophy
composed
of
three
pipes
a
sabre
and
a
pair
of
pistols
after
a
visit
to
the
grocer
over
the
way
where
he
bought
a
pound
of
candles
and
a
bottle
of
rum
he
returned
put
his
purchase
on
the
and
looked
around
him
with
an
air
of
perfect
satisfaction
and
then
with
the
promptitude
of
the
camp
he
shaved
without
a
mirror
brushed
his
coat
cocked
his
hat
over
his
ear
and
went
for
a
walk
in
the
village
in
search
of
a
café
ii
it
was
an
inveterate
habit
of
the
captain
to
spend
much
of
his
time
at
a
café
it
was
there
that
he
satisfied
at
the
same
time
the
three
vices
which
reigned
supreme
in
his
heart
tobacco
absinthe
and
cards
it
was
thus
that
he
passed
his
life
and
he
could
have
drawn
a
plan
of
all
the
places
where
he
had
ever
been
stationed
by
their
tobacco
shops
cafés
and
military
clubs
he
never
felt
himself
so
thoroughly
at
ease
as
when
sitting
on
a
worn
velvet
bench
before
a
square
of
green
cloth
near
a
heap
of
and
saucers
his
cigar
never
seemed
good
unless
he
struck
his
match
under
the
marble
of
the
table
and
he
never
failed
after
hanging
his
hat
and
his
sabre
on
a
and
settling
himself
comfortably
by
unloosing
one
or
two
buttons
of
his
coat
to
breathe
a
profound
sigh
of
relief
and
exclaim
that
is
better
his
first
care
was
therefore
to
find
an
establishment
which
he
could
frequent
and
after
having
gone
around
the
village
without
finding
anything
that
suited
him
he
stopped
at
last
to
regard
with
the
eye
of
a
connoisseur
the
café
prosper
situated
at
the
corner
of

the
rue
de
la
pavoisse
it
was
not
his
ideal
some
of
the
details
of
the
exterior
were
too
provincial
the
waiter
in
his
black
apron
for
example
the
little
stands
in
their
green
frames
the
footstools
and
the
wooden
tables
covered
with
waxed
cloth
but
the
interior
pleased
the
captain
he
was
delighted
upon
his
entrance
by
the
sound
of
the
bell
which
was
touched
by
the
fair
and
fleshy
dame
du
comptoir
in
her
light
dress
with
a
ribbon
in
her
sleek
hair
he
saluted
her
gallantly
and
believed
that
she
sustained
with
sufficient
majesty
her
triumphal
place
between
two
piles
of
properly
crowned
by
he
ascertained
that
the
place
was
cheerful
neat
and
strewn
evenly
with
yellow
sand
he
walked
around
it
looking
at
himself
in
the
glasses
as
he
passed

the
panels
where
guardsmen
and
amazons
were
drinking
champagne
in
a
landscape
filled
with
red
called
for
his
absinthe
smoked
found
the
divan
soft
and
the
absinthe
good
and
was
indulgent
enough
not
to
complain
of
the
flies
who
bathed
themselves
in
his
glass
with
true
rustic
familiarity
eight
days
later
he
had
become
one
of
the
pillars
of
the
café
prosper
they
soon
learned
his
punctual
habits
and
anticipated
his
wishes
while
he
in
turn
lunched
with
the
patrons
of
the
place
a
valuable
recruit
for
those
who
haunted
the
café
folks
oppressed
by
the
tedium
of
a
country
life
for
whom
the
arrival
of
that
past
master
in
all
games
and
an
admirable
raconteur
of
his
wars
and
his
loves
was
a
true
stroke
of
the
captain
himself
was
delighted
to
tell
his
stories
to
folks
who
were
still
ignorant
of
his
repertoire
there
were
fully
six
months
before
him
in
which
to
tell
of
his
games
his
feats
his
battles
the
retreat
of
constantine
the
capture
of
and
the
officers
receptions
with
the
concomitant
intoxication
of
illustration
human
weakness
he
was
by
no
means
sorry
on
his
part
to
be
something
of
an
oracle
he
from
whom
the
at
fled
dismayed
fearing
his
long
stories
illustration
his
usual
auditors
were
the
keeper
of
the
café
a
stupid
and
silent
always
in
his
sleeved
vest
and
remarkable
only
for
his
carved
pipe
the
bailiff
a
scoffer
dressed
invariably
in
black
scorned
for
his
inelegant
habit
of
carrying
off
what
remained
of
his
sugar
the
the
gentleman
of
acrostics
a
person
of
much
amiability
and
a
feeble
constitution
who
sent
to
the
illustrated
journals
solutions
of
enigmas
and
rebuses
and
lastly
the
veterinary
surgeon
of
the
place
the
only
one
who
from
his
position
of
atheist
and
democrat
was
allowed
to
contradict
the
captain
this
practitioner
a
man
with
tufted
whiskers
and
presided
over
the
radical
committee
of
electors
and
when
the
curé
took
up
a
little
collection
among
his
devotees
for
the
purpose
of
adorning
his
church
with
some
frightful
red
and
gilded
statues
denounced
in
a
letter
to
the
the
cupidity
of
the
jesuits
the
captain
having
gone
out
one
evening
for
some
cigars
after
an
animated
political
discussion
the
aforesaid
veterinary
grumbled
to
himself
certain
phrases
of
heavy
irritation
concerning
coming
to
the
point
and
a
mere
and
cutting
a
figure
but
as
the
object
of
these
vague
menaces
suddenly
returned
whistling
a
march
and
beating
time
with
his
cane
the
incident
was
without
result
in
short
the
group
lived
harmoniously
together
and
willingly
permitted
themselves
to
be
presided
over
by
the
whose
white
beard
and
martial
bearing
were
quite
impressive
and
the
small
city
proud
of
so
many
things
was
also
proud
of
its
retired
captain
iii
perfect
happiness
exists
nowhere
and
captain
mercadier
who
believed
that
he
had
found
it
at
the
café
prosper
soon
recovered
from
his
illusion
for
one
thing
on
mondays
the
the
café
prosper
was
untenantable
from
early
morning
it
was
overrun
with
farmers
and
poultrymen
heavy
men
with
coarse
voices
red
necks
and
great
whips
in
their
hands
wearing
blue
blouses
and
caps
bargaining
over
their
cups
stamping
their
feet
striking
their
fists
familiar
with
the
servant
and
bungling
at
billiards
when
the
captain
came
at
eleven
for
his
first
glass
of
absinthe
he
found
this
crowd
gathered
and
already
ordering
a
quantity
of
lunches
his
usual
place
was
taken
and
he
was
served
slowly
and
badly
the
bell
was
continually
sounding
and
the
proprietor
and
the
waiter
with
napkins
under
their
arms
were
running
distractedly
hither
and
thither
in
short
it
was
an
day
which
upset
his
entire
existence
illustration
now
one
monday
morning
when
he
was
resting
quietly
at
home
being
sure
that
the
café
would
be
much
too
full
and
busy
the
mild
radiance
of
the
autumn
sun
persuaded
him
to
go
down
and
sit
upon
the
stone
seat
by
the
side
of
the
house
he
was
sitting
there
depressed
and
smoking
a
damp
cigar
when
he
saw
coming
down
the
end
of
the
street
it
was
a
badly
paved
lane
leading
out
into
the
country
a
little
girl
of
eight
or
ten
driving
before
her
a
geese
as
the
captain
looked
carelessly
at
the
child
he
saw
that
she
had
a
wooden
leg
there
was
nothing
paternal
in
the
heart
of
the
soldier
it
was
that
of
a
hardened
bachelor
in
former
days
in
the
streets
of
algiers
when
the
little
begging
arabs
pursued
him
with
their
importunate
prayers
the
captain
had
often
chased
them
away
with
blows
from
his
whip
and
on
those
rare
occasions
when
he
had
penetrated
the
nomadic
household
of
some
comrade
who
was
married
and
the
father
of
a
family
he
had
gone
away
cursing
the
crying
babies
and
awkward
children
who
had
touched
with
their
greasy
hands
the
gilding
on
his
uniform
but
the
sight
of
that
particular
infirmity
which
recalled
to
him
the
sad
spectacle
of
wounds
and
amputations
touched
on
that
account
the
old
soldier
he
felt
almost
a
constriction
of
the
heart
at
the
sight
of
that
sorry
creature
in
her
tattered
petticoats
and
old
chemise
bravely
running
along
behind
her
geese
her
bare
foot
in
the
dust
and
limping
on
her
wooden
stump
the
geese
recognizing
their
home
turned
into
the
and
the
little
one
was
about
to
follow
them
when
the
captain
stopped
her
with
this
question
eh
little
girl
what
your
name
pierette
monsieur
at
your
service
she
answered
looking
at
him
with
her
great
black
eyes
and
pushing
her
disordered
locks
from
her
forehead
you
live
in
this
house
then
i
have
seen
you
before
yes
i
know
you
pretty
well
though
for
i
sleep
under
the
stairs
and
you
wake
me
up
every
evening
when
you
come
home
is
that
so
my
girl
ah
well
i
must
walk
on
my
toes
in
future
how
old
are
you
nine
monsieur
come
day
is
the
landlady
here
a
relative
of
yours
no
monsieur
i
am
in
service
and
they
give
you
soup
and
a
bed
under
the
stairs
and
how
came
you
to
be
lame
like
that
my
poor
little
one
by
the
kick
of
a
cow
when
i
was
five
have
you
a
father
or
mother
the
child
blushed
under
her
sunburned
skin
i
came
from
the
foundling
hospital
she
said
briefly
then
with
an
awkward
courtesy
she
passed
limping
into
the
house
and
the
captain
heard
as
she
went
away
on
the
pavement
of
the
court
the
hard
sound
of
the
little
wooden
leg
good
heavens
he
thought
mechanically
walking
towards
his
café
not
at
all
the
thing
a
soldier
at
least
they
pack
off
to
the
invalides
with
the
money
from
his
medal
to
keep
him
in
tobacco
for
an
officer
they
fix
up
a
collectorship
and
he
marries
somewhere
in
the
provinces
but
this
poor
girl
with
such
an
infirmity
that
not
at
all
the
thing
having
established
in
these
terms
the
injustice
of
fate
the
captain
reached
the
threshold
of
his
dear
café
but
he
saw
there
such
a
mob
of
blue
blouses
he
heard
such
a
din
of
laughter
and
click
of
that
he
returned
home
in
very
bad
humor
his
room
it
was
perhaps
the
first
time
that
he
had
spent
in
it
several
hours
of
the
day
looked
rather
shabby
his
were
the
color
of
an
old
pipe
the
fireplace
was
heaped
with
old
and
one
could
have
written
his
name
in
the
dust
on
the
furniture
he
contemplated
for
some
time
the
walls
where
the
sublime
lancer
of
leipsic
rode
a
hundred
times
to
a
glorious
death
then
for
an
occupation
he
passed
his
wardrobe
in
review
it
was
a
lamentable
series
of
bottomless
pockets
socks
full
of
holes
and
shirts
without
buttons
i
must
have
a
servant
he
said
then
he
thought
of
the
little
lame
girl
that
what
i
do
i
hire
the
next
little
room
winter
is
coming
and
the
little
thing
will
freeze
under
the
stairs
she
will
look
after
my
clothes
and
my
linen
and
keep
the
barracks
clean
a
valet
that
but
a
cloud
darkened
the
comfortable
picture
the
captain
remembered
that
was
still
a
long
way
off
and
that
his
account
at
the
cafe
prosper
was
assuming
alarming
proportions
not
rich
enough
he
said
to
himself
and
in
the
mean
time
they
are
robbing
me
down
there
that
is
positive
the
board
is
too
high
and
that
wretch
of
a
veterinary
plays
bezique
much
too
well
i
have
paid
his
way
now
for
eight
days
who
knows
perhaps
i
had
better
put
the
little
one
in
charge
of
the
mess
soup
au
café
in
the
morning
stew
at
noon
and
ragout
every
evening
campaign
life
in
fact
i
know
all
about
that
quite
the
thing
to
try
going
out
he
saw
at
once
the
mistress
of
the
house
a
great
brutal
peasant
and
the
little
lame
girl
who
both
with
pitchforks
in
their
hands
were
turning
over
the
in
the
yard
does
she
know
how
to
sew
to
wash
to
make
soup
he
asked
brusquely
who
pierette
why
does
she
know
a
little
of
all
that
of
course
she
came
from
an
asylum
where
they
learn
how
to
take
care
of
themselves
tell
me
little
one
added
the
captain
speaking
to
the
child
i
am
not
scaring
you
no
well
my
good
woman
will
you
let
me
have
her
i
want
a
servant
if
you
will
support
her
then
that
is
finished
here
are
twenty
francs
let
her
have
a
dress
and
a
shoe
we
arrange
the
rest
and
with
a
friendly
tap
on
pierette
cheek
the
captain
went
off
delighted
that
everything
was
concluded
possibly
he
thought
he
would
have
to
cut
off
some
glasses
of
beer
and
absinthe
and
be
cautious
of
the
veterinary
skill
at
bezique
but
that
was
not
worth
speaking
of
and
the
new
arrangement
would
be
quite
the
thing
iv
captain
you
are
a
coward
such
was
the
apostrophe
with
which
the
caryatides
of
the
café
prosper
hereafter
greeted
the
captain
whose
visits
became
rarer
day
by
day
for
the
poor
man
had
not
seen
all
the
consequences
of
his
good
action
the
suppression
of
his
morning
absinthe
had
been
sufficient
to
cover
the
modest
expense
of
pierette
keeping
but
how
many
other
reforms
were
needed
to
provide
for
the
unforeseen
expenses
of
his
bachelor
establishment
full
of
gratitude
the
little
girl
wished
to
prove
it
by
her
zeal
already
the
aspect
of
his
room
was
changed
the
furniture
was
dusted
and
arranged
the
fireplace
cleaned
the
floor
polished
and
spiders
no
longer
spun
their
webs
over
the
deaths
of
poniatowski
in
the
corner
when
the
captain
came
home
the
inviting
odor
of
saluted
him
on
the
staircase
and
the
sight
of
the
smoking
plates
on
the
coarse
but
white
with
a
bunch
of
flowers
and
polished
was
quite
enough
to
give
him
a
good
appetite
pierette
profited
by
the
of
her
master
to
confess
some
of
her
secret
ambitions
she
wanted
andirons
for
the
fireplace
where
there
was
now
always
a
fire
burning
and
a
mould
for
the
little
cakes
that
she
knew
how
to
make
so
well
and
the
captain
smiling
at
the
child
requests
but
charmed
with
the
homelike
atmosphere
of
his
room
promised
to
think
of
it
and
on
the
morrow
replaced
his
londres
by
cigars
for
a
sou
each
hesitated
to
offer
five
points
at
ecarté
and
refused
his
third
glass
of
beer
or
his
second
glass
of
chartreuse
illustration
certainly
the
struggle
was
long
it
was
cruel
often
when
the
hour
came
for
the
glass
that
was
denied
him
by
economy
when
thirst
seized
him
by
the
throat
the
captain
was
forced
to
make
an
heroic
effort
to
withdraw
his
hand
already
reaching
out
towards
the
swan
beak
of
the
café
many
times
he
wandered
about
dreaming
of
the
king
turned
up
and
of
quint
and
quatorze
but
he
almost
always
courageously
returned
home
and
as
he
loved
pierette
more
through
every
sacrifice
that
he
made
for
her
he
embraced
her
more
fondly
every
day
for
he
did
embrace
her
she
was
no
longer
his
servant
when
once
she
stood
before
him
at
the
table
calling
him
monsieur
and
so
respectful
in
her
bearing
he
could
not
stand
it
but
seizing
her
by
her
two
hands
he
said
to
her
eagerly
first
embrace
me
and
then
sit
down
and
do
me
the
pleasure
of
speaking
familiarly
confound
it
and
so
it
is
accomplished
meeting
a
child
has
saved
that
man
from
an
ignominious
age
he
has
substituted
for
his
old
vices
a
young
passion
he
adores
the
little
lame
girl
who
skips
around
him
in
his
room
which
is
comfortable
and
well
furnished
he
has
already
taught
pierette
to
read
and
moreover
recalling
his
calligraphy
as
a
he
has
set
her
copies
in
writing
it
is
his
greatest
joy
when
the
child
bending
attentively
over
her
paper
and
sometimes
making
a
blot
which
she
quickly
licks
up
with
her
tongue
has
succeeded
in
copying
all
the
letters
of
an
interminable
adverb
in
his
uneasiness
is
in
thinking
that
he
is
growing
old
and
has
nothing
to
leave
his
adopted
child
and
so
he
becomes
almost
a
miser
he
theorizes
he
wishes
to
give
up
his
tobacco
although
pierette
herself
fills
and
lights
his
pipe
for
him
he
counts
on
saving
from
his
slender
income
enough
to
purchase
a
little
stock
of
fancy
goods

when
he
is

silenus
in
scarlet
drawers
roared
out
his
furious
appeal
in
a
loud
voice
mixed
with
the
crowd
of
loafers
soldiers
and
women
i
regarded
the
abject
spectacle
with
disgust
the
last
vestige
of
the
olympic
games
suddenly
the
music
ceased
and
the
crowd
broke
into
roars
of
laughter
the
clown
had
just
made
his
appearance
illustration
he
wore
the
ordinary
costume
of
his
kind
the
short
vest
and
stockings
of
the
peasants
of
the
opera
comique
the
three
horns
turned
backward
the
red
wig
with
its
queue
and
its
butterfly
on
the
end
he
was
a
young
man
but
alas
his
face
whitened
with
flour
was
already
seamed
with
vice
planting
himself
before
the
public
and
opening
his
mouth
in
a
silly
grin
he
showed
bleeding
gums
almost
devoid
of
teeth
the
ringmaster
kicked
him
violently
from
behind
come
in
he
said
tranquilly
then
the
traditional
dialogue
punctuated
by
slaps
in
the
face
began
between
the
mountebank
and
his
clown
and
the
entire
audience
applauded
these
souvenirs
of
the
classic
farce
fallen
from
the
theatre
to
the
stage
of
the
mountebank
and
whose
humor
coarse
but
pungent
seemed
a
drunken
echo
of
the
laughter
of
molière
the
clown
exerted
his
low
talent
throwing
out
at
each
moment
some
low
jest
some
immodest
pun
to
which
his
master
simulating
a
prudish
indignation
responded
by
thumps
on
the
head
but
the
adroit
clown
excelled
in
the
art
of
receiving
affronts
he
knew
to
perfection
how
to
bend
his
body
like
a
bow
under
the
impulse
of
a
kick
and
having
received
on
one
cheek
a
blow
he
stuffed
his
tongue
at
once
in
that
cheek
and
began
to
whine
until
a
new
blow
passed
the
artificial
swelling
into
the
other
cheek
blows
showered
on
him
as
thick
as
hail
and
disappearing
under
a
shower
of
slaps
the
flour
on
his
face
and
the
red
powder
of
his
wig
enveloped
him
like
a
cloud
at
last
he
exhausted
all
his
resources
of
low
scurrility
ridiculous
contortions
grotesque
grimaces
pretended
aches
falls
at
full
length
till
the
ringmaster
judging
this
gratuitous
show
long
enough
and
that
the
public
were
sufficiently
fascinated
sent
him
off
with
a
final
cuff
then
the
music
began
again
with
such
violence
that
the
painted
canvas
trembled
the
clown
having
seized
the
sticks
of
a
drum
fixed
on
one
of
the
beams
of
the
scaffolding
mingled
a
triumphant
rataplan
with
the
bombardment
of
the
the
cracked
thunder
of
the
cymbals
and
the
distracted
wail
of
the
clarionet
the
ringmaster
roaring
again
with
his
heavy
voice
announced
that
the
show
was
about
to
begin
and
as
a
sign
of
defiance
he
threw
two
or
three
old
among
his
the
crowd
rushed
into
the
tent
and
soon
only
a
small
group
of
loungers
remained
in
front
of
the
deserted
stage
i
was
just
going
off
when
i
noticed
by
my
side
an
old
woman
who
looked
with
strange
persistence
at
the
empty
stage
where
the
red
lights
were
still
burning
she
wore
the
linen
bonnet
and
the
crossed
fichu
of
the
poorer
class
of
women
and
her
whole
appearance
was
that
of
neatness
and
honesty
asking
myself
what
powerful
interest
could
hold
her
in
such
a
place
i
looked
at
her
with
more
attention
and
i
saw
that
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
that
her
hands
which
she
had
crossed
over
her
breast
were
trembling
with
emotion
what
is
the
matter
with
you
i
said
coming
near
to
her
impelled
by
an
instinctive
sympathy
the
matter
good
sir
cried
the
old
woman
bursting
into
tears
passing
by
this
oh
quite
by
chance
i
tell
you
i
have
no
heart
for
pleasure
passing
before
that
dreadful
tent
i
have
just
seen
in
the
wretch
who
has
received
all
those
blows
my
only
son
sir
my
sole
child
it
is
the
grief
of
my
life
do
you
see
i
never
knew
what
had
become
of
him
since
oh
since
my
poor
husband
sent
him
away
to
sea
as
a
he
was
apprenticed
to
an
ironmonger
sir
he
robbed
his
master
he
the
son
of
two
honest
people
as
for
me
i
would
have
pardoned
him
you
know
what
mothers
are
but
my
man
when
they
came
and
told
him
that
his
son
had
stolen
he
was
like
a
madman
it
was
that
that
killed
him
i
am
sure
i
have
never
seen
the
unhappy
child
again
for
five
years
i
have
heard
nothing
from
him
i
sought
to
deceive
myself
i
said
experience
will
reform
him
and
there
there
just
now
and
the
poor
old
woman
sobbed
in
a
pitiful
way
a
crowd
had
formed
it
was
no
longer
to
me
that
she
spoke
it
was
not
to
the
crowd
it
was
to
herself
to
the
bitterness
of
her
own
heart
he
my
adrien
the
child
that
i
nourished
at
my
own
breast
a
mountebank
in
a
travelling
theatre
struck
and
insulted
before
the
whole
world
he
whom
i
saved
at
four
when
he
was
so
ill
a
clown
in
a
tent
he
the
beautiful
baby
of
whom
i
was
so
proud
whom
i
made
the
neighbors
admire
when
he
was
so
small
that
he
rolled
naked
on
my
knee
holding
his
little
foot
in
his
hand
suddenly
at
this
point
in
her
monologue
the
old
woman
perceived
the
crowd
listening
to
her
she
looked
on
the
spectators
in
astonishment
as
one
who
starts
from
sleep
she
recognized
me
who
had
questioned
her
and
became
frightfully
pale
what
have
i
said
she
stammered
let
me
pass
and
brusquely
putting
us
aside
with
an
imperious
gesture
she
went
off
with
a
rapid
step
and
disappeared
in
the
night
the
adventure
made
a
lively
impression
on
me
i
thought
often
of
it
and
after
that
when
i
saw
before
my
eyes
some
wretched
and
degraded
creature
some
woman
of
the
street
trailing
her
light
silk
skirts
in
the
flare
of
a
some
drunken
idler
leaning
on
the
bar
of
a
café
and
bending
his
bloated
face
over
his
glass
of
absinthe
i
have
thought
is
it
possible
that
that
being
can
ever
have
been
a
little
child
now
some
little
time
after
that
let
us
be
careful
not
to
indicate
the
date
i
was
taken
into
a
gallery
of
the
chamber
of
deputies
to
be
present
at
a
sensational
sitting
the
law
that
they
were
discussing
on
that
day
is
of
no
importance
but
it
was
the
old
and
tedious
story
a
ministerial
candidate
formerly
in
the
opposition
proposed
to
strike
a
blow
at
some
liberty
i
do
know
what
which
he
had
formerly
demanded
with
virulence
and
force
and
more
than
that
the
man
in
power
was
going
to
forfeit
his
word
to
the
tribune
in
good
french
that
is
called
to
betray
but
in
parliamentary
language
they
employ
the
phrase
accomplish
a
change
of
base
opinion
was
divided
the
majority
uncertain
and
upon
his
speech
would
depend
the
political
future
of
the
speaker
therefore
on
that
day
the
legislators
were
in
their
places
and
the
chamber
did
not
resemble
as
usual
a
class
of
noisy
boys
presided
over
by
a
master
without
authority
the
was
deserted
and
the
deputies
of
the
centre
themselves
were
not
absorbed
in
their
personal
correspondence
the
orator
mounted
the
tribune
he
had
the
commonplace
figure
of
a
verbose
orator
bold
eye
protruding
lips
as
enlarged
by
the
abuse
of
words
he
began
by
fingering
his
notes
with
an
important
air
tasting
the
glass
of
sweetened
water
and
settling
himself
in
his
place
then
he
started
a
babble
of
words
without
sense
with
the
nauseous
facility
of
the
bar
misusing
vague
ideas
abstract
terms
and
words
in
and
stereotyped
words
and
phrases
a
flattering
murmur
greeted
the
end
of
his
exordium
for
the
french
people
in
general
and
the
political
world
in
particular
manifest
a
depraved
taste
for
that
sort
of
eloquence
encouraged
the
fine
speaker
entered
the
heart
of
his
subject
and
cynically
sang
his
recantation
he
abjured
none
of
his
opinions
he
repudiated
none
of
his
acts
he
would
always
remain
liberal
a
blow
on
his
chest
but
that
which
was
good
yesterday
might
be
dangerous
truth
on
the
other
side
of
the
alps
error
on
this
side
the
forbearance
of
the
government
was
abused
and
he
threatened
the
assembly
became
prophet
let
loose
the
dogs
of
war
he
even
risked
a
bit
of
poetry
flourished
old
metaphors
which
were
worn
out
in
the
time
of
cicero
and
compared
by
turn
in
the
same
phrase
his
political
career
to
a
pilot
a
steed
and
a
torch
so
much
poetry
could
only
accentuate
his
success
there
was
a
salvo
of
bravos
and
the
opposition
grumbled
foreseeing
their
defeat
violent
interruptions
broke
forth
furious
voices
recalled
the
orator
past
life
and
threw
as
insults
his
former
professions
in
his
face
he
was
unmoved
and
stood
with
a
disdainful
air
which
was
very
effective
then
the
bravos
redoubled
and
he
smiled
vaguely
thinking
no
doubt
of
the
of
the
where
he
could
insert
in
the
margin
without
too
much
exaggeration
profound
sensation
and
prolonged
applause
then
when
quiet
was
sure
of
his
success
he
affected
a
serene
majesty
he
took
up
again
his
discourse
soaring
like
a
goose
launching
out
with
high
doctrine
citing
illustration
but
i
heard
no
more
the
scandalous
spectacle
of
that
political
mountebank
who
sacrificed
eternal
principles
to
the
interests
of
the
day
recalled
to
my
memory
the
tent
of
the
acrobats
the
cold
rhetoric
of
that
harangue
vibrating
with
neither
truth
nor
emotion
recalled
to
me
the
patter
learned
by
heart
of
the
powdered
clown
on
the
stage
the
superb
air
which
the
orator
assumed
under
the
rain
of
reproaches
and
insults
singularly
resembled
the
indifference
of
the
clown
to
the
loud
slaps
on
his
face
those
sonorous
phrases
whose
echoes
had
just
died
away
sounded
as
false
as
a
strolling
band
the
word
liberty
rolled
like
the
public
interests
and
welfare
of
the
state
clanged
discordantly
like
the
cymbals
and
when
the
comedian
spoke
of
his
patriotism
i
almost
heard
the
of
a
clarionet
a
long
uproar
woke
me
from
my
revery
the
speech
was
finished
and
the
orator
having
descended
from
the
rostrum
was
receiving
congratulations
they
were
about
to
vote
the
urns
were
being
passed
around
but
the
result
was
certain
and
the
crowd
of
tribunes
was
already
dispersing
as
i
went
across
the
vestibule
i
saw
an
elderly
lady
dressed
in
black
she
was
dressed
like
a
wealthy
bourgeoise
and
appeared
radiant
i
stopped
one
of
the
little
chaps
whom
one
sees
trotting
around
in
the
ministerial
corridors
i
knew
him
slightly
and
i
asked
him
who
that
lady
was
the
mother
of
the
orator
he
replied
with
official
emotion
she
must
be
very
proud
very
proud
the
old
mother
who
wept
so
bitterly
in
the
was
not
that
and
if
the
mother
of
his
future
excellency
had
reflected
she
would
have
regretted
she
too
the
time
when
her
boy
was
very
small
and
rolled
naked
on
her
knee
holding
his
little
foot
in
his
hand
but
bah
everything
is
relative
even
shame
illustration
a
voluntary
death
illustration
a
voluntary
death
i
knew
the
poet
louis
miraz
very
well
in
the
old
times
in
the
latin
quarter
where
we
used
to
take
our
meals
together
at
a
crémerie
on
the
rue
de
seine
kept
by
an
old
polish
woman
whom
we
nicknamed
the
princess
chocolawska
on
account
of
the
enormous
bowl
of
créme
and
chocolate
which
she
exposed
daily
in
the
of
her
shop
it
was
possible
to
dine
there
for
ten
sous
with
two
breads
an
ordinaire
for
thirty
centimes
and
a
small
coffee
some
who
were
very
nice
spent
a
sou
more
for
a
napkin
besides
some
young
men
who
were
destined
to
become
geniuses
the
ordinary
guests
of
the
crémerie
were
some
poor
compatriots
of
the
proprietress
who
had
all
to
some
extent
commanded
armies
there
was
above
all
an
imposing
and
melancholy
old
fellow
with
a
white
beard
whose
old
befrogged
cloak
shabby
boots
and
old
hat
which
looked
as
if
snails
had
crawled
over
it
presented
a
poem
of
misery
and
whom
the
other
poles
treated
with
a
marked
respect
for
he
had
been
a
dictator
for
three
days
it
was
moreover
at
the
princess
chocolawska
that
i
knew
a
singular
fool
who
gained
his
bread
by
giving
german
lessons
and
declared
himself
a
convert
to
buddhism
on
the
mantle
of
the
miserable
room
where
he
lived
with
a
milliner
of
was
enthroned
an
ugly
little
buddha
in
jade
fixing
his
hypnotized
eyes
on
his
navel
and
holding
his
great
toes
in
his
hands
the
german
professor
accorded
to
the
idol
the
most
profound
veneration
but
on
the
epoch
of
he
was
sometimes
forced
to
carry
him
to
the
upon
which
he
fell
into
a
state
of
sombre
chagrin
and
did
not
recover
his
serenity
until
he
was
able
to
make
amends
for
his
impious
act
he
never
failed
moreover
to
renew
his
avowals
in
prosperous
times
and
finally
to
take
his
god
out
of
pawn
as
to
louis
miraz
he
had
the
deep
eyes
the
pale
complexion
and
the
long
and
dishevelled
hair
of
all
those
young
men
who
come
to
town
in
carriages
to
conquer
glory
who
spend
more
for
midnight
oil
than
for
beefsteaks
and
who
rich
already
with
some
manuscripts
have
thrown
out
to
great
paris
from
the
height
of
some
hill
in
its
environs
the
classic
defiance
of
rastignac
at
that
time
my
hair
was
archaic
enough
in
length
to
grease
the
collar
of
my
coat
thus
we
were
made
to
understand
each
other
and
louis
miraz
soon
took
me
to
his
in
the
rue
des
where
he
dragged
two
thousand
alexandrines
over
me
illustration
seriously
they
were
fresh
and
charming
verses
with
the
inspiration
of
having
the
perfume
of
the
first
lilacs
and
the
title
of
that
collection
of
poems
which
louis
miraz
published
a
little
while
after
he
read
them
to
me
will
retain
a
place
among
the
volumes
in
the
first
rank
of
by
the
side
of
those
poets
of
a
single
book
of
the
daudet
of
the
amoureuses
for
example
for
miraz
wrote
no
more
verse
a
young
eaglet
seeking
the
upper
air
he
made
his
eyrie
on
the
summit
of
montmartre
and
for
quite
a
while
we
lost
sight
of
him
then
i
found
his
name
again
in
sunday
journals
and
reviews
when
he
began
to
write
those
short
and
exquisite
sketches
which
have
made
his
reputation
thus
five
years
passed
when
i
met
him
one
day
in
the
editor
office
of
a
journal
for
which
i
worked
each
of
us
was
as
much
pleased
as
the
other
at
thus
meeting
again
and
after
the
first
what
is
that
you
is
that
you
we
stood
facing
each
other
shaking
hands
and
exposing
in
a
laugh
of
cordial
delight
our
teeth
which
in
old
times
we
used
to
exercise
on
the
same
crust
of
poverty
he
had
not
changed
he
had
not
even
sacrificed
his
long
hair
which
he
threw
back
with
the
graceful
movement
of
a
horse
who
tosses
his
mane
only
he
had
the
clear
complexion
and
calm
eye
of
a
contented
man
and
his
slim
figure
was
clad
in
most
fashionable
costume
we
wo
drift
apart
again
will
we
said
he
affectionately
taking
me
by
the
arm
and
he
led
me
out
in
the
boulevard
where
the
april
sun
gilded
the
young
leaves
of
the
ah
happy
day
how
we
exhausted
the
do
you
remembers
do
you
remember
the
fried
eggs
which
tasted
of
straw
and
the
dreadful
of
the
princess
chocolawska
and
the
melancholy
air
of
the
old
dictator
and
the
german
who
used
to
pawn
his
god
every
three
months
at
last
those
days
of
hardship
were
finished
he
had
from
afar
applauded
my
success
as
i
had
watched
his
but
one
thing
i
did
not
know
and
that
was
that
he
had
married
a
woman
whom
he
adored
and
that
he
had
a
charming
little
girl
come
and
see
them
you
shall
dine
with
me
i
let
myself
be
persuaded
and
he
carried
me
down
to
the
enclos
des
ternes
where
he
lived
in
a
cottage
among
the
trees
there
everything
made
you
welcome
no
sooner
had
we
opened
the
door
of
the
garden
than
a
young
dog
frisked
about
our
feet
down
gavroche
he
will
soil
your
clothes
but
at
the
sound
of
the
bell
madame
miraz
appeared
at
the
steps
with
her
little
daughter
in
her
arms
an
imposing
and
beautiful
blond
her
figure
wrapped
in
a
blue
gown
put
on
a
plate
more
i
an
old
comrade
with
me
and
the
happy
father
keeping
his
hat
on
his
head
and
carrying
his
little
girl
showed
me
all
over
his
establishment
the
brightened
by
light
bits
of
faience
the
study
abounding
in
books
with
its
window
opening
out
on
the
green
turf
so
that
a
puff
of
wind
had
strewn
with
the
printer
proofs
which
were
scattered
on
the
table
this
is
only
a
beginning
you
know
it
was
so
long
ago
that
we
were
working
for
three
sous
a
line
and
while
i
luxuriated
under
a
blossoming
which
i
saw
in
the
garden
miraz
at
ease
in
his
home
had
slipped
into
his
put
on
his
slippers
and
lying
on
his
sofa
caught
little
helen
in
his
arms
to
toss
her
in
the
air
houp
la
houp
la
i
do
not
remember
ever
to
have
had
a
more
perfect
impression
of
contentment
we
dined
pleasantly
two
good
courses
that
was
all
a
dinner
without
pretence
where
we
served
ourselves
with
the
the
charming
madame
miraz
presided
with
her
bright
smile
having
her
child
by
her
side
in
a
she
spoke
but
little
but
her
sweet
and
intelligent
attention
followed
our
light
and
paradoxical
chat
the
fooling
of
men
of
letters
and
at
the
dessert
she
took
a
rose
from
the
bouquet
which
ornamented
the
table
and
placed
it
in
her
hair
near
her
ear
with
a
supreme
grace
she
was
indeed
that
lovely
and
silent
friend
whom
a
dreamer
requires
we
took
our
coffee
in
the
study
they
intended
to
furnish
the
salon
very
soon
with
the
price
of
a
story
to
be
published
by
levy
then
as
the
evening
was
cool
a
fire
of
sticks
and
twigs
was
built
and
while
we
smoked
miraz
and
i
recalling
old
memories
the
mistress
of
the
house
holding
on
her
knees
little
helen
now
ready
for
bed
made
her
repeat
our
father
and
hail
mary
which
the
little
one
lisped
rubbing
her
little
feet
together
before
the
warm
flame
we
saw
each
other
again
often
at
first
then
less
frequently
the
difficult
and
complicated
life
of
literary
labor
taking
us
each
his
own
way
so
the
years
passed
we
met
shook
hands
everything
going
well
splendidly
and
that
was
all
then
later
i
found
the
name
of
louis
miraz
but
rarely
in
the
journals
and
periodicals
happy
man
he
is
resting
i
said
to
myself
remembering
that
he
was
spoken
of
as
having
made
a
small
fortune
finally
last
autumn
i
learned
that
he
was
seriously
ill
i
hurried
to
see
him
he
still
lived
at
the
enclos
des
ternes
but
on
this
sombre
day
of
the
last
of
november
the
little
house
seemed
cold
and
looked
naked
among
the
leafless
trees
it
seemed
to
me
shrunken
and
diminished
like
everything
that
we
have
not
seen
for
a
long
time
the
dog
was
probably
dead
for
his
bark
no
longer
answered
the
sound
of
the
bell
when
i
passed
the
little
gate
and
entered
the
garden
all
strewn
with
dead
leaves
where
the
night
frost
had
withered
the
last
chrysanthemums
it
was
not
madame
miraz
she
was
absent
it
was
helen
who
received
me
helen
who
had
grown
to
be
a
great
girl
of
fourteen
with
an
awkward
manner
she
opened
for
me
the
door
of
her
father
study
and
brusquely
lifting
her
great
black
eyelashes
turned
on
me
a
timid
and
distressed
glance
i
found
miraz
huddled
in
an
in
the
corner
of
the
fireplace
wrapped
in
a
sort
of
with
gray
locks
streaking
his
long
hair
and
by
the
cold
clammy
hand
which
he
reached
towards
me
by
the
pallid
face
which
he
turned
upon
me
i
knew
that
he
was
lost
horrible
i
found
in
my
unhappy
comrade
that
worn
and
ruined
look
which
used
to
strike
us
formerly
among
the
poor
poles
of
the
crémerie
illustration
ah
well
old
man
things
are
not
going
well
deucedly
bad
my
boy
he
answered
with
a
smile
i
am
going
out
stupidly
with
consumption
as
they
do
in
the
fifth
act
you
know
when
the
venerable
doctor
with
a
head
like
béranger
feels
the
first
walking
gentleman
pulse
and
lifts
his
eyes
towards
heaven
saying
approaches
only
the
difference
is
that
with
me
it
continues
it
will
not
conclude
the
smoke
away
that
does
disturb
me
he
added
seeing
me
put
my
cigar
one
side
his
cough
sounding
like
a
i
tried
to
find
encouraging
words
i
talked
with
him
holding
him
by
the
hand
and
patting
him
affectionately
on
the
shoulder
but
my
voice
had
in
my
own
ears
the
empty
hollowness
of
deceit
and
miraz
looking
at
me
seemed
to
pity
my
efforts
i
was
silent
look
said
he
pointing
to
his
table
see
my
for
six
months
i
have
not
been
able
to
write
it
was
true
nothing
could
be
more
sad
than
that
heap
of
papers
covered
with
dust
and
in
an
old
roman
plate
there
was
a
bundle
of
pens
crusted
with
ink
and
like
those
trophies
of
rusty
foils
which
hang
on
the
walls
of
old
fencers
i
made
a
new
attempt
to
revive
him
die
at
his
age
nonsense
he
taking
care
of
himself
he
must
pass
the
winter
in
the
south
drink
a
good
draught
of
sunlight
he
could
he
was
easy
in
his
money
matters
but
he
stopped
me
putting
his
hand
on
my
arm
listen
he
said
gravely
we
have
seen
each
other
seldom
but
you
are
my
oldest
perhaps
my
best
friend
you
have
proved
me
pen
in
hand
well
i
am
going
to
tell
you
something
in
confidence
for
you
to
keep
to
yourself
unless
it
may
serve
on
some
occasion
to
discourage
the
young
literary
aspirants
who
bring
their
manuscripts
to
you
always
a
praiseworthy
action
yes
i
have
been
successful
yes
i
have
been
paid
a
franc
a
line
yes
i
have
made
money
and
there
in
that
drawer
are
a
certain
number
of
yellow
green
and
red
papers
from
which
a
bit
is
clipped
every
six
months
and
which
represent
three
or
four
thousand
francs
of
income
it
is
rare
in
our
profession
and
to
gain
that
poor
hoard
i
have
been
obliged
i
a
poet
to
imitate
the
unsociable
virtues
of
a
bourgeois
know
how
to
deny
a
jewel
to
my
wife
a
dress
to
my
daughter
at
last
i
have
that
money
and
i
often
said
to
myself
if
i
should
die
their
bread
is
assured
and
here
is
a
little
marriage
portion
for
helen
and
i
was
content
i
was
proud
for
i
know
them
the
stories
of
our
widows
and
our
orphans
the
fourpenny
help
of
the
government
the
tobacco
shops
for
six
hundred
francs
in
the
province
and
if
the
daughter
is
intelligent
and
pretty
like
mine
the
dramatic
author
an
old
friend
of
the
father
who
advises
her
to
enter
the
conservatoire
and
who
makes
of
her
mercy
of
god
that
shall
never
be
but
for
all
that
my
boy
it
is
necessary
that
i
should
not
linger
sickness
is
expensive
and
already
it
has
been
necessary
to
sell
one
or
two
bonds
from
that
drawer
to
seek
the
sunlight
as
you
suggest
to
bask
like
a
lizard
at
cannes
or
at
menton
one
more
bond
must
go
and
there
would
not
be
enough
to
last
to
the
end
if
i
should
wait
for
seven
or
eight
years
more
now
that
i
can
no
longer
write
happily
there
is
nothing
to
fear
but
what
i
have
suffered
since
i
have
been
incapable
of
writing
and
have
felt
my
hoard
of
gold
shrink
and
diminish
in
my
hand
like
the
magic
skin
of
balzac
is
frightful
now
you
understand
me
do
you
not
and
you
will
no
longer
bid
me
take
care
of
myself
no
if
you
still
pray
to
god
ask
him
to
send
me
speedily
to
the
undertaker
fifteen
days
later
some
thirty
of
us
followed
the
hearse
which
carried
louis
miraz
to
the
cemetery
montmartre
it
had
snowed
the
day
before
and
doctor
arnould
the
old
frequenter
of
painters
studios
the
friend
and
physician
of
the
dead
man
walking
behind
me
called
in
his
brusque
voice
very
commonplace
but
always
terrible
the
contrast
a
burial
in
the
snow
black
on
white
the
funeral
of
the
poor
by
the
late
vigneron

to
be
ridiculed

at
last

came
to
the
edge

the
grave

were
sad

a
cloudy
sky
the
little
swayed
by
the
wind
threw
down
their
burdens

melted
snow

had
formed
a
circle

were
watching
the
who
were
lowering
the
coffin
by
cords
near
a
whose
short
surplice
permitted
the
bottom
of
his
trousers
to
be
seen
the
priest
waited
with
a
finger
in
his
book
and
having
grasped
the
rim
of
his
hat
under
his
left
arm
the
orator
of
the
society
of
men
of
letters
already
held
in
his
hand
the
funeral
oration
hastily
patched
up
by
the
aid
of
a
comrade
over
a
couple
of
glasses
at
the
corner
of
a
café
table
suddenly
as
the
priest
began
his
latin
prayers
doctor
arnould
seized
me
by
the
arm
and
whispered
in
my
ear
you
know
that
he
killed
himself
i
looked
at
him
with
astonishment
but
he
pointed
to
the
group
in
black
composed
of
madame
miraz
and
her
daughter
who
were
sobbing
under
their
long
veils
and
clasping
each
other
in
a
tragic
embrace
and
he
added
for
them
yes
for
six
months
he
threw
all
his
medicines
in
the
fire
and
designedly
committed
all
sorts
of
imprudences
he
confessed
it
to
me
before
his
death
i
had
not
understood
it
at
all
i
who
had
expected
to
prolong
his
life
at
least
three
years
by
creosote
at
last
the
other
night
when
it
was
freezing
cold
he
left
his
window
open
as
if
by
forgetfulness
and
was
taken
with
bleeding
at
the
lungs
yes
that
he
might
leave
bread
for
those
two
women
the
curé
does
not
dream
that
he
is
blessing
a
suicide
but
what
of
it
my
good
fellow
miraz
is
in
the
paradise
of
the
brave
the
details
of
such
a
death
eh
it
is
tougher

had
played
the
role

boulevard

his
harsh
voice
his
nose

beak

eye

this
sort
of
success
which
is
only
betrayed
by
murmurs

horror
is
not

the
kind
to
make
a
dramatic

seductive

old
actor
had
always
hidden
in
a
corner
of
his
heart
the
bucolic
ideal
which
is
in
the
heart
of
almost
all
artists
he
sighed
for
an
old
age
of
leisure
and
the
comfortable
dignity
of
a
retired
shopkeeper
the
house

the
country

he
could
live
with
his
family
with
melons
under
an
arbor
cakes

winter
evenings
his

scholar

son

uniform
of
the
polytechnique
and
the
cross

legion

when
we
had
occasion
to
know
him

had
already
nearly
realized
his
dreams
after
the
failure

the
theatre
where
he
had
been
for
a
long
time
engaged
some
capitalists
had
thought
of
him
to
put
the
enterprise
on
its
feet
again
with
his
systematic
habits
his
good
sense
his
thorough
and
practical
knowledge
of
the
business
and
a
sufficiently
correct
literary
instinct
he
became
an
excellent
manager
he
was
the
owner
of
stocks
and
a
villa

montmorency

student
at

his

just
come
out
of
les
oiseaux

if
the
malice
of
small
newspapers
had
retarded
his
nomination
in
the
legion
of
honor
by
recalling
every
year
about
the
first
of
january
his
old
ranting
on
the
stage
when
he
played
formerly
the
villains
parts
he
could
yet
hope
that
it
would
not
be
long
before
the
red
ribbon
would
flourish
in

had
still
preserved
some
of
the
habits
of
a
strolling
player
such
as
being
very
familiar
with
everybody
and
dyeing
his
mustaches
but
as
he
was
on
the
whole
good
honest
and
serviceable
he
conquered
the
esteem
and
friendship
of
those
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
so
it
was
with
sincere
grief
that
the
whole
dramatic
world
learned
one
day
the
terrible
sorrow
which
had
smitten
that
excellent
man
his
daughter
a
girl
of
seventeen
had
died
suddenly
of
we
knew
how
he
adored
the
child
how
he
had
brought
her
up
in
the
strictest
principles
of
family
and
religion
far
from
the
theatre
something
as
triboulet
hid
his
daughter
blanche

little
house

understood
that
all
the
hopes
and
ambitions
of
the
man
rested
on
the
head
of
that
charming
girl
who
near
all
the
corruption
of
the
theatre
had
grown
up
in
innocence
and
purity
as
one
sees
sometimes
in
the
scanty
grass
of
the
faubourgs
a
spring
up
by
the
door
of
a
hovel

we
were
among

the
funeral

which
we
had
been
summoned
by
a
billet

crowd
of
the
people
of
the
neighborhood
encumbered
the
street
before
the
house
of
the
dead
attracted
by
the
pomps
of
the
funeral
ordered
by
the
old
comedian
who
had
preserved
the
taste
of
the
en
even
in
his
grief
the
magnificent
hearse
and
cumbrous
were
already
drawn
up
to
the
sidewalk
and
under
the
door
and
in
the
shade
of
the
heavy
fringed
and
silvered
draperies
amid
the
twinkling
of
burning
candles
between
two
priests
reading
prayers
in
their
the
form
of
the
massive
coffin
could
be
seen
under
its
white
cloth
covered
with
parma
violets
as
we
walked
among
the
crowd
we
noticed
the
groups
formed
of
those
who
like
us
were
waiting
the
departure
of
the
cortége
there
were
almost
all
the
actors
men
and
women
of
paris
who
had
come
to
pay
their
last
respects
to
the
daughter
of
their
comrade
undoubtedly
nothing
could
be
more
natural
but
we
experienced
not
the
less
a
strange
sensation
on
seeing
around
the
coffin
of
that
pure
young
girl
who
had
breathed
away
her
last
breath
in
a
prayer
the
gathering
of
all
those
faces
marked
by
the
brand
of
the

were

there

comedians

shutter
of
a
shop
in
his
familiar
attitude
and
crossed
his
arms
to
show
his
handsome
hands
while
a
little
old
fellow
with
the
wrinkled
face
of
a
clown
spoke
to
him
briskly
in
the
broad
harsh
voice
which
had
so
often
made
us
explode
with
laughter
by
the
side
of
the
aged
first
young
man
who
pinched
in
his
scanty
and
with
trousers
trailing
under
foot
twirled
in
his
gloved
hands
his
locks
of
hair
stood
a
great
handsome
fellow
beautiful
as
a
model
who
had
not
been
able
to
renounce
even
for
that
day
his
eccentricities
of
costume
and
strutted
in
a
black
velvet
cape
and
the
boots
of
an
equerry
oh
how
sad
tired
and
old
they
seemed
in
the
gray
light
of
that
winter
morning
all
those
pathetic
heads
graceful
or
laughable
which
we
were
only
in
the
habit
of
seeing
when
transfigured
by
the
prestige
of
the
stage
chins
had
become
under
too
frequent
shaving
hair
thin
and
dry
under
the
hot
iron
of
the
skins
rough
under
the
injurious
action
of
unguents
and
vinegar
eyes
dull
burned
by
the
glare
of
blinded
almost
fixed
like
those
of
an
owl
in
the
sunlight
illustration
the
women
were
especially
to
be
pitied
obliged
by
the
occasion
to
rise
at
a
very
early
hour
and
not
having
had
the
time
for
a
careful
and
minute
toilet
they
gathered
in
groups
of
four
or
five
chilled
and
shivering
in
their
fur
mantles
muffs
and
triple
black
veils
notwithstanding
the
hasty
rouge
and
powder
of
the
morning
they
were
unrecognizable
and
it
required
an
effort
of
imagination
to
find
in
them
a
memory
of
that
sublime
seraglio
of
the
parisian
theatres
exposed
every
evening
to
the
desires
of
several
thousand
men
on
all
of
these
charming
types
appeared
the
mark
of
weariness
and
age
some
ossified
into
faded
skeletons
others
grew
dull
with
an
unhealthy
weight
of
fat
wrinkles
crossed
the
foreheads
and
starred
the
temples
lips
were
livid
and
eyes
circled
with
dark
rings
the
complexions
were
particularly
frightful
that
uniform
tint
morbid
and
sickly
the
work
of
rouge
and
that
heavy
woman
with
the
head
and
neck
of
a
wife
one
almost
sees
a
basket
on
her
shoulder
is
the
terrible
and
fatal
queen
of
grand
romantic
dramas
and
that
small
blonde
and
pale
creature
so
faded
under
her
laces
and
who
would
have
completely
filled
a
carrying
roll
was
the
artless
young
woman
whom
all
the
vaudevillists
married
at
the
dénouement
of
their
pieces
there
were
the
dying
glances
of
the
lorette
in
the
hospital
the
pose
of
the
old
copyist
of
the
louvre
and
the
theatrical
sneer
illustration
soon
the
cabs
drove
up
with
the
functionaries
connected
with
the
administration
of
the
theatre
in
black
hats
and
coats
with
an
official
air
of
sadness
young
reporters
the
outflow
of
journalism
staring
at
everybody
and
taking
notes
dramatic
authors
monday
feuilletonists
in
short
all
of
those
nocturnal
beings
tired
and
who
are
properly
called
the
actives
of
paris
the
groups
became
more
compact
and
talked
animatedly
old
friends
found
each
other
they
shook
hands
and
in
view
of
the
circumstances
smiled
cordially
while
the
women
saluted
each
other
through
their
veils
in
passing
we
could
catch
fragments
of
conversation
like
this
when
will
the
affair
begin
were
you
at
the
opening
of
the
variétès
yesterday
theatrical
terms
were
heard
my
talents
my
charms
my
physique
some
business
even
was
done
a
new
manager
was
quite
surrounded
an
old
actress
organized
her
benefit
suddenly
there
was
a
movement
in
the
crowd
the
undertaker
men
had
just
placed
the
coffin
in
the
hearse
and
the
young
girls
of
the
sisterhood
of
the
virgin
to
which
the
dead
girl
had
belonged
arranged
themselves
in
two
lines
in
their
white
veils
at
the
sides
of
the
preceded
by
the
master
of
ceremonies
in
silk
stockings
and
a
wand
of
office
in
his
hand
the
poor
father
appeared
on
the
pavement
in
full
mourning
with
a
white
cravat
broken
down
by
grief
and
sustained
by
his
friends
the
procession
set
out
and
came
to
the
parish
church
fortunately
near
there
was
a
grand
mass
with
music
which
was
not
finished
it
was
too
warm
in
the
church
stuffed
with
people
and
the
inattention
was
general
men
who
recognized
each
other
saluted
with
a
light
movement
of
the
head
conversation
was
exchanged
in
a
low
voice
some
young
actors
struck
attitudes
for
the
benefit
of
the
women
and
the
pious
responded
to
dominus
vobiscum
droned
by
the
priest
at
the
elevation
from
behind
the
altar
rang
out
a
magnificent
pié
jesu
sung
by
a
celebrated
baritone
who
had
never
put
in
his
voice
so
much
amorous
languor
outside
the
the
small
boys
of
the
quarter
stood
on
tiptoe
and
hanging
on
to
the
railings
pointed
out
the
celebrities
with
their
fingers
the
office
finished
the
long
defile
commenced
and
every
one
went
to
the
entrance
of
the
church
to
sprinkle
some
drops
of
on
the
bier
and
press
the
hand
of
the
old
actor
who
broken
by
grief
and
having
hardly
strength
to
hold
his
hat
leaned
against
a
pillar
that
was
the
most
horrible
moment
carried
away
by
the
habit
of
playing
up
to
the
situation
all
these
theatrical
people
put
into
the
token
of
sympathy
which
they
gave
to
their
friend
the
character
of
their
employment
the
star
advanced
gravely
and
with
a
inclination
of
his
head
flashed
out
the
look
of
fate
the
old
tragedian
with
a
gray
beard
assumed
a
stoical
expression
and
did
not
forget
to
vibrate
in
pronouncing
a
masculine
courage
the
clown
approached
with
a
short
trotting
step
and
shaking
his
head
until
his
cheeks
trembled
he
murmured
my
poor
old
fellow
and
the
fairy
queen
with
the
sensibility
of
a
sensitive
female
threw
herself
impulsively
on
the
neck
of
the
unhappy
father
who
with
swollen
face
bloodshot
eyes
and
hanging
lip
blackened
his
face
and
his
gloved
hands
with
the
dye
of
his
mustache
diluted
by
tears
and
all
the
time
a
few
steps
from
this
grotesque
and
sinister
scene
we
could
see
last
word
of
this
antithesis
the
white
figures
of
the
young
girls
of
the
sisterhood
kneeling
on
the
chairs
nearest
the
coffin
of
their
companion
and
who
undoubtedly
were
beseeching
god
in
their
naïve
and
original
prayers
to
grant
her
the
paradise
of
their
dreams
a
pretty
paradise
in
the
jesuitical
style
all
in
carved
and
gilded
wood
and
marble
where
one
could
see
at
the
end
a
tableau
in
a
transparent
light
the
virgin
crowned
with
stars
with
a
serpent
under
her
feet
while
little
cherubs
suspended
in
over
her
head
an
azure
streamer
flaming

words

the

he
was
scarcely
ten
years
old
when
he
was
first
arrested
as
a
vagabond
he
spoke
thus
to
the
judge
i
am
called
jean
françois
leturc
and
for
six
months
i
was
with
the
man
who
sings
and
plays
upon
a
cord
of
catgut
between
the
lanterns
at
the
place
de
la
bastille
i
sang
the
refrain
with
him
and
after
that
i
called
all
the
new
songs
ten
centimes
two
sous
he
was
always
drunk
and
used
to
beat
me
that
is
why
the
police
picked
me
up
the
other
night
before
that
i
was
with
the
man
who
sells
brushes
my
mother
was
a
laundress
her
name
was
adéle
at
one
time
she
lived
with
a
man
on
the
at
montmartre
she
was
a
good
and
liked
me
she
made
money
because
she
had
for
customers
waiters
in
the
cafés
and
they
use
a
good
deal
of
linen
on
sundays
she
used
to
put
me
to
bed
early
so
that
she
could
go
to
the
ball
on
she
sent
me
to
les
fréres
where
i
learned
to
read
well
the
whose
beat
was
in
our
street
used
always
to
stop
before
our
windows
to
talk
with
her
a
chap
with
a
medal
from
the
crimea
they
were
married
and
after
that
everything
went
wrong
he
did
take
to
me
and
turned
mother
against
me
every
one
had
a
blow
for
me
and
so
to
get
out
of
the
house
i
spent
whole
days
in
the
place
clichy
where
i
knew
the
mountebanks
my
lost
his
place
and
my
mother
her
work
she
used
to
go
out
washing
to
take
care
of
him
this
gave
her
a
cough
the
steam
she
is
dead
at
lamboisière
she
was
a
good
woman
since
that
i
have
lived
with
the
seller
of
brushes
and
the
catgut
scraper
are
you
going
to
send
me
to
prison
he
said
this
openly
cynically
like
a
man
he
was
a
little
ragged
as
tall
as
a
boot
his
forehead
hidden
under
a
queer
mop
of
yellow
hair
nobody
claimed
him
and
they
sent
him
to
the
reform
school
not
very
intelligent
idle
clumsy
with
his
hands
the
only
trade
he
could
learn
there
was
not
a
good
one
that
of
reseating
straw
chairs
however
he
was
obedient
naturally
quiet
and
silent
and
he
did
not
seem
to
be
profoundly
corrupted
by
that
school
of
vice
but
when
in
his
seventeenth
year
he
was
thrown
out
again
on
the
streets
of
paris
he
unhappily
found
there
his
prison
comrades
all
great
scamps
exercising
their
dirty
professions
teaching
dogs
to
catch
rats
in
the
the
sewers
and
blacking
shoes
on
ball
nights
in
the
passage
of
the
opera
amateur
wrestlers
who
permitted
themselves
to
be
thrown
by
the
hercules
of
the
booths
or
fishing
at
noontime
from
rafts
all
of
these
occupations
he
followed
to
some
extent
and
some
months
after
he
came
out
of
the
house
of
correction
he
was
arrested
again
for
a
petty
theft
a
pair
of
old
shoes
prigged
from
a
result
a
year
in
the
prison
of
sainte
pélagie
where
he
served
as
valet
to
the
political
prisoners
he
lived
in
much
surprise
among
this
group
of
prisoners
all
very
young
negligent
in
dress
who
talked
in
loud
voices
and
carried
their
heads
in
a
very
solemn
fashion
they
used
to
meet
in
the
cell
of
one
of
the
oldest
of
them
a
fellow
of
some
thirty
years
already
a
long
time
in
prison
and
quite
a
fixture
at
sainte
pélagie
a
large
cell
the
walls
covered
with
colored
caricatures
and
from
the
window
of
which
one
could
see
all
paris
its
roofs
its
spires
and
its
domes
and
far
away
the
distant
line
of
hills
blue
and
indistinct
upon
the
sky
there
were
upon
the
walls
some
shelves
filled
with
volumes
and
all
the
old
paraphernalia
of
a
broken
masks
rusty
foils
and
gloves
that
were
losing
their
tow
it
was
there
that
the
politicians
used
to
dine
together
adding
to
the
everlasting
soup
and
beef
fruit
cheese
and
pints
of
wine
which
jean
françois
went
out
and
got
by
the
can
a
tumultuous
repast
interrupted
by
violent
disputes
and
where
during
the
dessert
the
carmagnole
and
ca
ira
were
sung
in
full
chorus
they
assumed
however
an
air
of
great
dignity
on
those
days
when
a
newcomer
was
brought
in
among
them
at
first
entertaining
him
gravely
as
a
citizen
but
on
the
morrow
using
him
with
affectionate
familiarity
and
calling
him
by
his
nickname
great
words
were
used
there
corporation
responsibility
and
phrases
quite
unintelligible
to
jean
françois
such
as
this
for
example
which
he
once
heard
imperiously
put
forth
by
a
frightful
little
hunchback
who
blotted
some
every
night
it
is
done
this
is
the
composition
of
the
cabinet
raymond
the
bureau
of
public
instruction
martial
the
interior
and
for
foreign
affairs
myself
his
time
done
he
wandered
again
around
paris
watched
afar
by
the
police
after
the
fashion
of
cockchafers
made
by
cruel
children
to
fly
at
the
end
of
a
string
he
became
one
of
those
fugitive
and
timid
beings
whom
the
law
with
a
sort
of
coquetry
arrests
and
releases
by
turn
something
like
those
platonic
fishers
who
in
order
that
they
may
not
exhaust
their
throw
immediately
back
in
the
water
the
fish
which
has
just
come
out
of
the
net
without
a
suspicion
on
his
part
that
so
much
honor
had
been
done
to
so
sorry
a
subject
he
had
a
special
bundle
of
memoranda
in
the
mysterious
portfolios
of
the
rue
de
jérusalem
his
name
was
written
in
round
hand
on
the
gray
paper
of
the
cover
and
the
notes
and
reports
carefully
classified
gave
him
his
successive
appellations
name
leturc
the
prisoner
leturc
and
at
last
the
criminal
leturc
he
was
two
years
out
of
prison
dining
where
he
could
sleeping
in
night
and
sometimes
in
and
taking
part
with
his
fellows
in
interminable
games
of
on
the
boulevards
near
the
barriers
he
wore
a
greasy
cap
on
the
back
of
his
head
carpet
slippers
and
a
short
white
blouse
when
he
had
five
sous
he
had
his
hair
curled
he
danced
at
constant
at
montparnasse
bought
for
two
sous
to
sell
for
four
at
the
door
of
bobino
the
jack
of
hearts
or
the
ace
of
clubs
serving
as
a
countermark
sometimes
opened
the
door
of
a
carriage
led
horses
to
the
from
the
lottery
of
all
sorts
of
miserable
employments
he
drew
a
goodly
number
who
can
say
if
the
atmosphere
of
honor
which
one
breathes
as
a
soldier
if
military
discipline
might
not
have
saved
him
taken
in
a
cast
of
the
net
with
some
young
loafers
who
robbed
drunkards
sleeping
on
the
streets
he
denied
very
earnestly
having
taken
part
in
their
expeditions
perhaps
he
told
the
truth
but
his
antecedents
were
accepted
in
lieu
of
proof
and
he
was
sent
for
three
years
to
poissy
there
he
made
coarse
playthings
for
children
was
tattooed
on
the
chest
learned
thieves
slang
and
the
a
new
liberation
and
a
new
plunge
into
the
sink
of
paris
but
very
short
this
time
for
at
the
end
of
six
months
at
the
most
he
was
again
compromised
in
a
night
robbery
aggravated
by
climbing
and
breaking
a
serious
affair
in
which
he
played
an
obscure
role
half
dupe
and
half
fence
on
the
whole
his
complicity
was
evident
and
he
was
sent
for
five
years
at
hard
labor
his
grief
in
this
adventure
was
above
all
in
being
separated
from
an
old
dog
which
he
had
found
on
a
and
cured
of
the
mange
the
beast
loved
him
toulon
the
ball
and
chain
the
work
in
the
harbor
the
blows
from
a
stick
wooden
shoes
on
bare
feet
soup
of
black
beans
dating
from
trafalgar
no
tobacco
money
and
the
terrible
sleep
in
a
camp
swarming
with
convicts
that
was
what
he
experienced
for
five
broiling
summers
and
five
winters
raw
with
the
mediterranean
wind
he
came
out
from
there
stunned
was
sent
under
surveillance
to
vernon
where
he
worked
some
time
on
the
river
then
an
incorrigible
vagabond
he
broke
his
exile
and
came
again
to
paris
he
had
his
savings
francs
that
is
to
say
time
enough
for
reflection
during
his
absence
his
former
wretched
companions
had
dispersed
he
was
well
hidden
and
slept
in
a
loft
at
an
old
woman
to
whom
he
represented
himself
as
a
sailor
tired
of
the
sea
who
had
lost
his
papers
in
a
recent
shipwreck
and
who
wanted
to
try
his
hand
at
something
else
his
tanned
face
and
his
calloused
hands
together
with
some
sea
phrases
which
he
dropped
from
time
to
time
made
his
tale
seem
probable
enough
illustration
one
day
when
he
risked
a
saunter
in
the
streets
and
when
chance
had
led
him
as
far
as
montmartre
where
he
was
born
an
unexpected
memory
stopped
him
before
the
door
of
les
frères
where
he
had
learned
to
read
as
it
was
very
warm
the
door
was
open
and
by
a
single
glance
the
passing
outcast
was
able
to
recognize
the
peaceable
nothing
was
changed
neither
the
bright
light
shining
in
at
the
great
windows
nor
the
crucifix
over
the
desk
nor
the
rows
of
benches
with
the
tables
furnished
with
and
pencils
nor
the
table
of
weights
and
measures
nor
the
map
where
pins
stuck
in
still
indicated
the
operations
of
some
ancient
war
heedlessly
and
without
thinking
jean
françois
read
on
the
blackboard
the
words
of
the
evangelist
which
had
been
set
there
as
a
copy
joy
shall
be
in
heaven
over
one
sinner
that
repenteth
more
than
over
ninety
and
nine
just
persons
which
need
no
repentance
it
was
undoubtedly
the
hour
for
recreation
for
the
brother
professor
had
left
his
chair
and
sitting
on
the
edge
of
a
table
he
was
telling
a
story
to
the
boys
who
surrounded
him
with
eager
and
attentive
eyes
what
a
bright
and
innocent
face
he
had
that
beardless
young
man
in
his
long
black
gown
and
white
necktie
and
great
ugly
shoes
and
his
badly
cut
brown
hair
streaming
out
behind
all
the
simple
figures
of
the
children
of
the
people
who
were
watching
him
seemed
scarcely
less
childlike
than
his
above
all
when
delighted
with
some
of
his
own
simple
and
priestly
pleasantries
he
broke
out
in
an
open
and
frank
peal
of
laughter
which
showed
his
white
and
regular
teeth
a
peal
so
contagious
that
all
the
scholars
laughed
loudly
in
their
turn
it
was
such
a
sweet
simple
group
in
the
bright
sunlight
which
lighted
their
dear
eyes
and
their
blond
curls
jean
françois
looked
at
them
for
some
time
in
silence
and
for
the
first
time
in
that
savage
nature
all
instinct
and
appetite
there
awoke
a
mysterious
a
tender
emotion
his
heart
that
seared
and
hardened
heart
unmoved
when
the
convict
cudgel
or
the
heavy
whip
of
the
watchman
fell
on
his
shoulders
beat
oppressively
in
that
sight
he
saw
again
his
infancy
and
closing
his
eyes
sadly
the
prey
to
torturing
regret
he
walked
quickly
away
then
the
words
written
on
the
blackboard
came
back
to
his
mind
if
it
was
too
late
after
all
he
murmured
if
i
could
again
like
others
eat
honestly
my
brown
bread
and
sleep
my
fill
without
nightmare
the
spy
must
be
sharp
who
recognizes
me
my
beard
which
i
shaved
off
down
there
has
grown
out
thick
and
strong
one
can
burrow
somewhere
in
the
great
and
work
can
be
found
whoever
is
not
worked
to
death
in
the
hell
of
the
galleys
comes
out
agile
and
robust
and
i
learned
there
to
climb
ropes
with
loads
upon
my
back
building
is
going
on
everywhere
here
and
the
masons
need
helpers
three
francs
a
day
i
never
earned
so
much
let
me
be
forgotten
and
that
is
all
i
ask
he
followed
his
courageous
resolution
he
was
faithful
to
it
and
after
three
months
he
was
another
man
the
master
for
whom
he
worked
called
him
his
best
workman
after
a
long
day
upon
the
scaffolding
in
the
hot
sun
and
the
dust
constantly
bending
and
raising
his
back
to
take
the
hod
from
the
man
at
his
feet
and
pass
it
to
the
man
over
his
head
he
went
for
his
soup
to
the
tired
out
his
legs
aching
his
hands
burning
his
eyelids
stuck
with
plaster
but
content
with
himself
and
carrying
his
money
in
a
knot
in
his
handkerchief
he
went
out
now
without
fear
since
he
could
not
be
recognized
in
his
white
mask
and
since
he
had
noticed
that
the
suspicious
glances
of
the
policeman
were
seldom
turned
on
the
tired
workman
he
was
quiet
and
sober
he
slept
the
sound
sleep
of
fatigue
he
was
free
at
last
oh
supreme
recompense
he
had
a
friend
he
was
a
like
himself
named
savinien
a
little
peasant
with
red
lips
who
had
come
to
paris
with
his
stick
over
his
shoulder
and
a
bundle
on
the
end
of
it
fleeing
from
the
and
going
to
mass
every
sunday
jean
françois
loved
him
for
his
piety
for
his
candor
for
his
honesty
for
all
that
he
himself
had
lost
and
so
long
ago
it
was
a
passion
profound
and
unrestrained
which
transformed
him
by
fatherly
cares
and
attentions
savinien
himself
of
a
weak
and
egotistical
nature
let
things
take
their
course
satisfied
only
in
finding
a
companion
who
shared
his
horror
of
the
the
two
friends
lived
together
in
a
fairly
comfortable
lodging
but
their
resources
were
very
limited
they
were
obliged
to
take
into
their
room
a
third
companion
an
old
auvergnat
gloomy
and
rapacious
who
found
it
possible
out
of
his
meagre
salary
to
save
something
with
which
to
buy
a
place
in
his
own
country
jean
françois
and
savinien
were
always
together
on
holidays
they
together
took
long
walks
in
the
environs
of
paris
and
dined
under
an
arbor
in
one
of
those
small
country
inns
where
there
are
a
great
many
mushrooms
in
the
sauces
and
innocent
rebusses
on
the
napkins
there
jean
françois
learned
from
his
friend
all
that
lore
of
which
they
who
are
born
in
the
city
are
ignorant
learned
the
names
of
the
trees
the
flowers
and
the
plants
the
various
seasons
for
harvesting
he
heard
eagerly
the
thousand
details
of
a
laborious
country
life
the
autumn
sowing
the
winter
chores
the
splendid
celebrations
of
harvest
and
vintage
days
the
sound
of
the
mills
at
the
and
the
flails
striking
the
ground
the
tired
horses
led
to
water
and
the
hunting
in
the
morning
mist
and
above
all
the
long
evenings
around
the
fire
of
that
were
shortened
by
some
marvellous
stories
he
discovered
in
himself
a
source
of
imagination
before
unknown
and
found
a
singular
delight
in
the
recital
of
events
so
placid
so
calm
so
monotonous
one
thing
troubled
him
however
it
was
the
fear
lest
savinien
might
learn
something
of
his
past
sometimes
there
escaped
from
him
some
low
word
of
thieves
slang
a
vulgar
gesture
vestiges
of
his
former
horrible
existence
and
he
felt
the
pain
one
feels
when
old
wounds
the
more
because
he
fancied
that
he
sometimes
saw
in
savinien
the
awakening
of
an
unhealthy
curiosity
when
the
young
man
already
tempted
by
the
pleasures
which
paris
offers
to
the
poorest
asked
him
about
the
mysteries
of
the
great
city
jean
françois
feigned
ignorance
and
turned
the
subject
but
he
felt
a
vague
inquietude
for
the
future
of
his
friend
his
uneasiness
was
not
without
foundation
savinien
could
not
long
remain
the
simple
rustic
that
he
was
on
his
arrival
in
paris
if
the
gross
and
noisy
pleasures
of
the
always
repelled
him
he
was
profoundly
troubled
by
other
temptations
full
of
danger
for
the
inexperience
of
his
twenty
years
when
spring
came
he
began
to
go
off
alone
and
at
first
he
wandered
about
the
brilliant
entrance
of
some
watching
the
young
girls
who
went
in
with
their
arms
around
each
others
waists
talking
in
low
tones
then
one
evening
when
lilacs
perfumed
the
air
and
the
call
to
quadrilles
was
most
captivating
he
crossed
the
threshold
and
from
that
time
jean
françois
observed
a
change
little
by
little
in
his
manners
and
his
visage
he
became
more
frivolous
more
extravagant
he
often
borrowed
from
his
friend
his
scanty
savings
and
he
forgot
to
repay
jean
françois
feeling
that
he
was
abandoned
jealous
and
forgiving
at
the
same
time
suffered
and
was
silent
he
felt
that
he
had
no
right
to
reproach
him
but
with
the
foresight
of
affection
he
indulged
in
cruel
and
inevitable
presentiments
one
evening
as
he
was
mounting
the
stairs
to
his
room
absorbed
in
his
thoughts
he
heard
as
he
was
about
to
enter
the
sound
of
angry
voices
and
he
recognized
that
of
the
old
auvergnat
who
lodged
with
savinien
and
himself
an
old
habit
of
suspicion
made
him
stop
at
the
and
listen
to
learn
the
cause
of
the
trouble
yes
said
the
auvergnat
angrily
i
am
sure
that
some
one
has
opened
my
trunk
and
stolen
from
it
the
three
louis
that
i
had
hidden
in
a
little
box
and
he
who
has
done
this
thing
must
be
one
of
the
two
companions
who
sleep
here
if
it
were
not
the
servant
maria
it
concerns
you
as
much
as
it
does
me
since
you
are
the
master
of
the
house
and
i
will
drag
you
to
the
courts
if
you
do
not
let
me
at
once
break
open
the
valises
of
the
two
masons
my
poor
gold
it
was
here
yesterday
in
its
place
and
i
will
tell
you
just
what
it
was
so
that
if
we
find
it
again
nobody
can
accuse
me
of
having
lied
ah
i
know
them
my
three
beautiful
gold
pieces
and
i
can
see
them
as
plainly
as
i
see
you
one
piece
was
more
worn
than
the
others
it
was
of
greenish
gold
with
a
portrait
of
the
great
emperor
the
other
was
a
great
old
fellow
with
a
queue
and
epaulettes
and
the
third
which
had
on
it
a
philippe
with
whiskers
i
had
marked
with
my
teeth
they
do
trick
me
do
you
know
that
i
only
wanted
two
more
like
that
to
pay
for
my
vineyard
come
search
these
fellows
things
with
me
or
i
will
call
the
police
hurry
up
all
right
said
the
voice
of
the
landlord
we
will
go
and
search
with
maria
so
much
the
worse
for
you
if
we
find
nothing
and
the
masons
get
angry
you
have
forced
me
to
it
illustration
jean
françois
soul
was
full
of
fright
he
remembered
the
embarrassed
circumstances
and
the
small
loans
of
savinien
and
how
sober
he
had
seemed
for
some
days
and
yet
he
could
not
believe
that
he
was
a
thief
he
heard
the
auvergnat
panting
in
his
eager
search
and
he
pressed
his
closed
fists
against
his
breast
as
if
to
still
the
furious
beating
of
his
heart
here
they
are
suddenly
shouted
the
victorious
miser
here
they
are
my
louis
my
dear
treasure
and
in
the
sunday
vest
of
that
little
hypocrite
of
limousin
look
landlord
they
are
just
as
i
told
you
here
is
the
napoleon
the
man
with
a
queue
and
the
philippe
that
i
have
bitten
see
the
dents
ah
the
little
beggar
with
the
sanctified
air
i
should
have
much
sooner
suspected
the
other
ah
the
wretch
well
he
must
go
to
the
convict
prison
at
this
moment
jean
françois
heard
the
step
of
savinien
coming
slowly
up
the
stairs
he
is
going
to
his
destruction
thought
he
three
stories
i
have
time
and
pushing
open
the
door
he
entered
the
room
pale
as
death
where
he
saw
the
landlord
and
the
servant
stupefied
in
a
corner
while
the
auvergnat
on
his
knees
in
the
disordered
heap
of
clothes
was
kissing
the
pieces
of
gold
enough
of
this
he
said
in
a
thick
voice
i
took
the
money
and
put
it
in
my
comrade
trunk
but
that
is
too
bad
i
am
a
thief
but
not
a
judas
call
the
police
i
will
not
try
to
escape
only
i
must
say
a
word
to
savinien
in
private
here
he
is
in
fact
the
little
limousin
had
just
arrived
and
seeing
his
crime
discovered
believing
himself
lost
he
stood
there
his
eyes
fixed
his
arms
hanging
jean
françois
seized
him
forcibly
by
the
neck
as
if
to
embrace
him
he
put
his
mouth
close
to
savinien
ear
and
said
to
him
in
a
low
supplicating
voice
keep
quiet
then
turning
towards
the
others
leave
me
alone
with
him
i
tell
you
i
wo
go
away
lock
us
in
if
you
wish
but
leave
us
alone
with
a
commanding
gesture
he
showed
them
the
door
they
went
out
illustration
savinien
broken
by
grief
was
sitting
on
the
bed
and
lowered
his
eyes
without
understanding
anything
listen
said
jean
françois
who
came
and
took
him
by
the
hands
i
understand
you
have
stolen
three
gold
pieces
to
buy
some
trifle
for
a
girl
that
costs
six
months
in
prison
but
one
only
comes
out
from
there
to
go
back
again
and
you
will
become
a
pillar
of
police
courts
and
tribunals
i
understand
it
i
have
been
seven
years
at
the
reform
school
a
year
at
sainte
pélagie
three
years
at
poissy
five
years
at
toulon
now
do
be
afraid
everything
is
arranged
i
have
taken
it
on
my
shoulders
it
is
dreadful
said
savinien
but
hope
was
springing
up
again
in
his
cowardly
heart
when
the
elder
brother
is
under
the
flag
the
younger
one
does
not
go
replied
jean
françois
i
am
your
substitute
that
all
you
care
for
me
a
little
do
you
not
i
am
paid
do
be
childish
do
refuse
they
would
have
taken
me
again
one
of
these
days
for
i
am
a
runaway
from
exile
and
then
do
you
see
that
life
will
be
less
hard
for
me
than
for
you
i
know
it
all
and
i
shall
not
complain
if
i
have
not
done
you
this
service
for
nothing
and
if
you
swear
to
me
that
you
will
never
do
it
again
savinien
i
have
loved
you
well
and
your
friendship
has
made
me
happy
it
is
through
it
that
since
i
have
known
you
i
have
been
honest
and
pure
as
i
might
always
have
been
perhaps
if
i
had
had
like
you
a
father
to
put
a
tool
in
my
hands
a
mother
to
teach
me
my
prayers
it
was
my
sole
regret
that
i
was
useless
to
you
and
that
i
deceived
you
concerning
myself
i
have
unmasked
in
saving
you
it
is
all
right
do
not
cry
and
embrace
me
for
already
i
hear
heavy
boots
on
the
stairs
they
are
coming
with
the
and
we
must
not
seem
to
know
each
other
so
well
before
those
chaps
he
pressed
savinien
quickly
to
his
breast
then
pushed
him
from
him
when
the
door
was
thrown
wide
open
it
was

first
so
low
spoken
but
what
politeness
in
the
grave
gestures
what
affability
in
looks
and
smiles
soon
after
the
wit
sparkled
these
men
for
the
most
part
old
or
very
mature
all
remarkable
through
birth
or
through
talent
had
lived
much
full
of
experience
and
memories
they
were
made
for
conversation
and
the
beauty
of
the
women
present
inspired
them
with
a
desire
to
shine
and
excited
them
to
a
courteous
rivalry
there
was
a
snapping
of
bright
words
a
flight
of
sudden
sallies
and
the
conversationalists
broke
into
groups
of
two
or
three
a
famous
voyager
with
bronzed
skin
recently
returned
from
the
farthest
deserts
told
his
two
neighbors
of
an
elephant
hunt
without
any
boasting
with
as
much
tranquillity
as
though
he
were
speaking
of
shooting
rabbits
farther
off
the
fine
profile
and
white
hair
of
an
illustrious
savant
was
gallantly
inclined
towards
the
comtesse
who
listened
to
him
laughing
a
very
slender
blonde
her
eyes
young
and
intent
with
a
collar
of
splendid
emeralds
on
a
bosom
like
a
professional
beauty
and
the
neck
and
shoulders
of
the
venus
de
medici
decidedly
the
dinner
promised
to
be
charming
as
well
as
sumptuous
ennui
that
too
frequent
guest
at
mundane
feasts
would
not
come
to
sit
at
that
table
these
fortunate
ones
were
going
to
pass
a
delicious
hour
drinking
enjoyment
through
every
pore
by
every
sense
illustration
now
at
that
same
table
at
the
lower
end
in
the
most
modest
place
a
man
still
young
the
least
qualified
the
most
obscure
of
all
who
were
there
a
man
of
reverie
and
imagination
one
of
those
dreamers
in
whom
is
something
of
philosophy
something
of
poetry
sat
silent
admitted
into
that
high
society
by
virtue
of
his
renown
as
an
artist
one
of
nature
aristocrats
but
without
vanity
sprung
from
the
people
and
not
forgetting
it
he
breathed
voluptuously
that
flower
of
civilization
which
is
called
good
company
he
knew
none
better
than
he
how
everything
in
this
environment
the
charm
of
the
women
the
wit
of
the
men
the
glittering
table
the
furnishing
of
the
hall
to
the
exquisite
wine
which
he
had
just
touched
to
his
lips
how
everything
was
choice
and
rare
and
he
rejoiced
that
a
concourse
of
things
so
lovely
and
so
harmonious
existed
he
was
plunged
in
a
bath
of
optimism
it
seemed
to
him
good
that
there
should
be
sometimes
and
somewhere
in
the
weary
world
beings
almost
happy
provided
that
they
were
accessible
to
pity
charitable
and
these
happy
people
probably
were
that
who
could
distress
them
what
could
injure
them
ah
beautiful
and
consoling
chimera
to
believe
that
for
such
as
these
life
is
pleasant
that
they
retain
always
or
almost
always
that
gay
happy
light
in
the
eye
that
smile
upon
the
lips
that
they
have
blotted
out
as
far
as
possible
from
their
existence
imperious
and
discreditable
desires
and
abject
infirmities
he
whom
we
will
call
the
dreamer
was
pursuing
that
train
of
thought
when
the
the
superb
entered
with
solemnity
carrying
in
a
great
silver
plate
a
turbot
of
fabulous
dimensions
one
of
those
phenomenal
fish
which
are
only
seen
in
the
old
paintings
representing
the
miraculous
draught
of
fish
or
perhaps
in
the
window
of
chevet
before
a
row
of
astonished
who
flatten
their
noses
against
the
glass
window
dinner
is
served
but
when
the
dreamer
had
before
him
on
his
plate
a
portion
of
the
monstrous
turbot
the
light
odor
of
the
sea
evoked
in
his
mind
prone
to
unexpected
suggestions
that
corner
of
breton
that
poor
village
of
sailors
where
he
had
been
belated
the
other
autumn
until
the
equinox
and
where
he
had
rendered
assistance
in
some
dreadful
storms
he
suddenly
called
to
mind
that
terrible
night
when
the
could
not
come
back
to
port
the
night
that
he
had
passed
on
the
mole
amid
a
group
of
frightened
women
standing
where
the
streamed
down
his
face
and
the
cold
and
furious
wind
seemed
striving
to
tear
his
clothes
from
his
back
what
a
life
was
theirs
those
poor
men
down
there
how
many
widows
young
and
old
wearing
always
the
black
shawl
went
at
break
of
day
with
their
swarms
of
children
to
earn
their
bread
oh
nothing
but
bread
working
in
the
sickening
smell
of
hot
oil
in
the
sardine
factories
he
saw
again
in
memory
the
church
above
the
village
up
the
cliff
the
steeple
painted
white
to
show
to
the
distant
boats
the
passage
between
the
reefs
and
he
saw
also
in
the
short
grass
of
the
cemetery
nibbled
by
the
sheep
the
gravestones
on
which
this
sinister
inscription
was
so
often
repeated
at
at
at
the
enormous
turbot
was
of
savory
and
delicate
taste
and
the
shrimp
sauce
with
which
it
was
served
proved
that
the
of
the
comte
had
followed
a
course
in
cooking
at
the
café
anglais
and
profited
by
it
for
our
refined
civilization
reaches
even
this
point
one
takes
degrees
in
culinary
science
there
are
doctors
in
roasts
and
bachelors
in
sauces
all
of
the
guests
eat
as
if
they
appreciated
and
with
delicate
gestures
but
without
showing
special
favor
for
exceptional
dishes
through
good
form
and
because
they
were
habituated
to
exquisite
food
the
dreamer
himself
had
no
appetite
he
was
still
in
thought
with
the
bretons
with
the
sons
of
the
sea
who
had
caught
perhaps
this
magnificent
turbot
he
remembered
the
day
that
followed
the
tempest
that
morning
rainy
and
gray
when
walking
by
the
heavy
leaden
sea
he
had
found
a
body
at
his
feet
and
recognized
it
as
that
of
an
old
sailor
the
father
of
a
family
who
had
been
lost
at
sea
three
days
before
mournful
jetsam
stranded
in
the
wrack
and
foam
so
to
see
with
the
gray
hair
of
the
drowned
full
of
sand
and
shells
a
shudder
passed
over
his
heart
illustration
but
the
lackeys
had
already
removed
the
plates
every
trace
of
the
giant
fish
had
disappeared
and
while
they
were
serving
another
course
the
diners
elegant
triflers
had
taken
up
their
chat
again
hunger
being
already
somewhat
appeased
they
were
more
animated
they
spoke
with
more
abandon
light
laughs
ran
round
oh
charming
and
gracious
company
then
the
dreamer
the
silent
guest
was
seized
with
an
infinite
sadness
for
all
the
work
and
distress
that
were
required
to
create
this
comfort
and
came
surging
on
his
imagination
that
these
men
of
the
world
might
wear
light
in
that
these
women
might
expose
their
arms
and
their
shoulders
the
temperature
of
the
room
was
that
of
a
spring
morning
and
who
furnished
the
coal
the
poor
devils
of
the
black
country
the
subterranean
workmen
who
lived
in
hellish
mines
how
white
and
fresh
is
the
complexion
of
that
young
woman
against
her
corsage
of
pink
satin
but
who
had
woven
that
satin
the
human
spider
of
lyons
the
weaver
always
at
his
trade
in
the
leprous
houses
of
the
croix
rousse
she
wears
in
her
tiny
ears
two
beautiful
pearls
what
brilliancy
what
opaline
transparence
almost
perfect
spheres
the
pearl
which
cleopatra
dissolved
in
vinegar
and
swallowed
and
which
was
worth
ten
thousand
sesterces
was
not
more
pure
but
does
she
know
that
young
woman
that
in
ceylon
on
the
banks
of
arripo
and
condatchy
the
indians
of
the
indian
company
plunge
heroically
down
in
twelve
fathoms
of
water
one
foot
in
the
heavy
stone
weight
which
drags
them
down
to
the
bottom
a
knife
in
the
left
hand
for
defence
against
the
shark
but
what
of
that
one
is
lovely
and
coquettish
the
air
of
the
is
warm
and
perfumed
there
one
can
dine
gaily
adorned
and
half
nude
flirting
with
one
neighbors
what
has
one
to
do
i
ask
you
with
a
dark
workman
who
digs
fifty
feet
under
the
ground
with
a
weaver
sitting
with
stiffened
joints
before
the
loom
with
a
savage
who
emerges
from
the
sea
and
sometimes
reddens
it
with
his
blood
why
should
one
think
of
things
so
sad
so
ugly
what
an
absurdity
meanwhile
the
dreamer
pursued
his
train
of
thought
an
instant
ago
without
taking
thought
mechanically
he
crumbled
on
the
cloth
a
bit
of
the
gilded
bread
which
was
placed
near
his
napkin
as
a
viand
a
mere
bit
of
fancy
insignificant
in
such
a
repast
it
made
him
think
of
the
phrase
of
the
great
lady
concerning
the
starving
wretches
let
them
eat
cake
nevertheless
this
little
cake
is
bread
all
the
same
bread
made
of
flour
which
in
turn
is
made
of
wheat
great
heaven
yes
it
is
bread
simply
bread
like
the
loaf
of
the
peasant
like
the
of
the
soldier
and
that
it
might
be
here
on
the
table
of
the
rich
required
the
patient
labor
of
many
poor
the
peasant
labored
sowed
reaped
he
pushed
his
plough
or
led
his
harrow
across
the
fertile
field
under
the
cold
needles
of
the
autumn
rain
he
started
from
sleep
full
of
terror
for
his
crop
when
it
thundered
by
night
he
trembled
seeing
the
passage
of
great
violet
clouds
charged
with
hail
he
went
forth
dissatisfied
and
gloomy
to
the
heavy
work
and
exhausting
labor
of
harvest
and
when
the
old
miller
twisted
by
rheumatism
which
he
has
caught
in
the
river
fogs
has
sent
the
flour
to
paris
the
with
the
great
white
hats
have
carried
the
crushing
sacks
on
their
broad
backs
and
last
night
even
in
the
baker
cellar
the
workmen
toiled
until
morning
verily
yes
it
has
cost
all
these
efforts
all
these
pains
the
bit
of
bread
carelessly
broken
by
the
white
hands
of
these
patricians
and
now
the
incorrigible
dreamer
was
possessed
by
these
things
the
delicacies
of
the
repast
only
recalled
to
him
the
suffering
of
humanity
presently
when
the
butler
poured
for
him
a
glass
of
chambertin
did
he
not
remember
that
certain
became
consumptive
through
blowing
bottles
let
it
pass
it
is
absurd
he
well
knows
that
so
the
world
is
made
an
economist
would
have
laughed
in
his
face
would
he
become
a
socialist
perhaps
there
will
always
be
rich
and
poor
as
there
will
always
be
men
and
hunchbacks
besides
the
fortunates
before
him
were
not
unjustly
so
these
were
not
vulgar
favorites
of
the
gilded
calf
parvenus
gross
and
conceited
the
nobleman
who
presides
at
the
table
bears
with
honor
and
dignity
a
name
associated
with
all
the
glories
of
france
the
general
with
the
gray
mustache
is
a
hero
and
charged
at
rezonville
with
the
intrepidity
of
a
murat
the
painter
the
poet
have
faithfully
served
art
and
beauty
the
chemist
a
man
who
began
life
as
a
in
a
and
to
whom
the
learned
world
listens
as
to
an
oracle
is
simply
a
man
of
genius
these
dames
are
generous
and
good
and
they
will
often
dip
their
fair
hands
courageously
in
the
depth
of
misfortune
why
should
not
these
members
of
the
have
exceptional
enjoyment
the
dreamer
said
to
himself
that
he
had
been
unjust
these
were
old
sophisms
good
at
the
best
for
the
clubs
of
the
faubourgs
which
had
been
awakened
in
his
memory
and
by
which
he
had
been
duped
is
it
possible
he
was
ashamed
of
himself
but
the
dinner
neared
its
end
and
while
the
lackeys
refilled
for
the
last
time
the
the
table
grew
silent
the
guests
felt
the
apathy
of
digestion
the
dreamer
looked
at
them
one
after
the
other
and
all
the
faces
had
satiated
expressions
which
disturbed
and
disquieted
him
a
sentiment
obscure
inexplicable
but
so
bitter
protested
even
from
the
depth
of
his
soul
against
that
repast
and
when
they
rose
at
last
from
the
table
he
repeated
softly
and
stubbornly
to
himself
yes
they
are
within
their
rights
but
do
they
know
do
they
understand
that
their
luxury
is
made
from
many
miseries
do
they
think
of
it
sometimes
do
they
think
of
it
as
often
as
they
should
do

saint
medard
the
old
church
of
the
rue
mouffetard
once
well
known
as
the
scene
of
the
convulsionnaires
is
a
very
poor
parish
the
faubourg
marceau
as
they
call
it
there
has
not
much
religion
and
the
must
have
hard
work
to
make
both
ends
meet
on
sundays
at
the
hours
of
service
there
are
but
few
there
and
they
are
for
the
most
part
women
some
twenty
of
the
folk
of
the
quarter
and
some
servants
in
their
round
caps
as
for
the
men
there
are
not
at
the
most
more
than
three
or
four
old
men
in
peasant
jackets
who
kneel
awkwardly
on
the
stone
floor
near
a
pillar
their
caps
under
their
arms
rolling
a
great
chaplet
of
beads
between
their
fingers
moving
their
lips
and
raising
their
eyes
towards
the
arched
roof
with
an
air
as
if
they
had
given
the
windows
on
week
days
nobody
on
thursdays
in
the
winter
the
aisles
resounded
for
an
instant
with
the
clang
of
wooden
shoes
when
the
students
of
the
catechism
came
and
went
sometimes
a
poor
woman
leading
one
or
two
children
and
carrying
a
baby
in
her
arms
came
to
burn
a
little
candle
on
the
stand
at
the
chapel
of
the
virgin
or
perhaps
one
heard
by
the
baptismal
font
the
wailing
of
a
babe
or
more
often
the
funeral
of
some
poor
wretch
a
deal
box
covered
with
a
black
cloth
and
resting
on
two
trestles
hastily
blessed
by
the
priest
before
a
little
group
of
women
the
men
being
and
waiting
the
conclusion
of
the
ceremony
in
the
across
the
way
where
they
played
bagatelle
for
drinks
therefore
the
old
abbé
faber
one
of
the
vicars
of
the
parish
is
sure
that
twice
out
of
three
times
he
will
find
no
penitent
before
his
confessional
and
has
only
to
hear
for
the
most
part
of
the
time
the
uninteresting
confession
of
some
good
women
but
he
is
conscientious
and
on
tuesdays
thursdays
and
saturdays
at
seven
precisely
he
betakes
himself
regularly
to
the
chapel
of
john
only
to
make
a
short
prayer
and
return
should
there
be
nobody
there
ii
one
day
last
winter
struggling
against
a
heavy
wind
with
his
open
umbrella
the
abbé
faber
toiled
painfully
up
the
rue
mouffetard
on
the
way
to
his
parish
and
almost
certain
that
his
toil
was
useless
he
regretted
to
himself
the
warm
fire
he
had
just
quitted
in
his
little
room
in
the
rue
and
the
folio
which
he
had
left
lying
on
the
table
with
his
on
its
open
pages
but
it
was
saturday
night
the
day
when
certain
old
widows
who
earned
their
scant
income
in
the
neighboring
sometimes
sought
absolution
for
the
morrow
communion
the
honest
priest
could
not
therefore
excuse
himself
from
entering
his
oak
box
and
opening
with
the
punctuality
of
a
cashier
that
wicket
where
the
devotees
for
whom
the
confessional
is
a
spiritual
make
a
weekly
deposit
of
their
venial
sins
the
abbé
faber
was
the
more
sorry
to
go
out
because
that
particular
saturday
was
and
on
such
occasions
the
rue
mouffetard
swarmed
with
people
and
a
people
not
well
disposed
toward
his
cloth
however
good
a
man
one
may
be
it
is
far
from
agreeable
to
be
forced
to
lower
the
eyes
to
avoid
malevolent
looks
and
to
stop
the
ears
against
insolent
words
heard
in
passing
there
was
a
certain
which
the
abbé
particularly
dreaded
a
shop
brilliant
with
gas
and
exhaling
an
odor
of
alcohol
through
its
open
doors
through
which
one
could
see
a
perspective
of
barrels
labelled
absinthe
bitter
madère
vermouth
etc
here
leaning
against
the
bar
were
always
a
band
of
loafers
in
long
blouses
and
high
hats
who
saluted
the
poor
abbé
walking
quickly
along
the
pavement
with
ribald
jests
however
on
this
night
the
streets
were
deserted
on
account
of
the
bad
weather
and
the
abbé
reached
his
church
without
interruption
he
dipped
his
finger
in
the
holy
water
crossed
himself
made
a
brief
reverence
before
the
grand
altar
and
went
towards
his
confessional
at
least
he
had
not
come
for
nothing
a
penitent
was
waiting
iii
a
male
penitent
a
rare
and
exceptional
thing
at
saint
médard
but
distinguishing
by
the
red
light
of
the
lamp
hanging
from
the
roof
of
the
chapel
the
short
white
jacket
and
the
heavy
nailed
shoes
of
the
kneeling
man
the
abbé
faber
believed
him
to
be
some
workman
who
had
kept
his
rustic
faith
and
his
early
habits
of
religious
observance
without
doubt
the
confession
that
he
was
about
to
hear
would
be
as
stupid
as
that
of
the
cook
of
the
rue
monge
who
after
having
accused
himself
of
petty
thefts
exclaimed
loudly
against
a
single
word
of
restitution
the
priest
even
smiled
to
himself
as
he
remembered
the
formal
confession
of
one
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
faubourg
who
came
to
ask
for
a
billet
of
confession
that
he
might
marry
i
have
neither
killed
or
robbed
ask
me
about
the
rest
and
so
the
vicar
entered
very
tranquilly
into
his
confessional
and
after
having
taken
a
copious
pinch
of
snuff
opened
without
emotion
the
little
curtain
of
green
serge
which
closed
the
wicket
monsieur
le
curé
stammered
a
rough
voice
which
was
making
an
effort
to
speak
low
i
am
not
a
curé
my
friend
say
your
and
call
me
father
the
man
whose
face
the
abbé
could
not
see
among
the
shadows
stumbled
through
the
prayer
which
he
seemed
to
have
great
difficulty
in
recalling
and
he
began
again
in
a
hoarse
whisper
monsieur
le
curé
no
my
father
excuse
me
if
i
do
not
speak
properly
but
i
have
not
been
to
confession
for
years
no
not
since
i
quitted
the
country
you
know
how
it
is
a
man
in
paris
and
yet
i
have
not
been
worse
than
other
people
and
i
have
said
to
myself
must
be
a
good
sort
of
fellow
but
what
i
have
on
my
conscience
is
too
heavy
to
carry
alone
and
you
must
hear
me
monsieur
le
curé
i
have
killed
a
man
the
abbé
half
rose
from
his
seat
a
murderer
there
was
no
longer
any
question
of
his
mind
wandering
from
the
duties
of
his
office
of
half
annoyance
at
the
garrulity
of
the
old
women
to
whom
he
listened
with
a
half
attentive
ear
and
whom
he
absolved
in
all
confidence
a
murderer
that
head
which
was
so
near
his
had
conceived
and
planned
such
a
crime
those
hands
crossed
on
the
confessional
were
perhaps
still
stained
with
blood
in
his
trouble
perhaps
not
unmixed
with
a
certain
amount
of
fear
the
abbé
faber
could
only
speak
mechanically
confess
yourself
my
son
the
mercy
of
god
is
infinite
listen
to
my
whole
story
said
the
man
with
a
voice
trembling
with
profound
grief
i
am
a
workingman
and
i
came
to
paris
more
than
twenty
years
ago
with
a
a
companion
from
childhood
we
robbed
and
we
learned
to
read
in
school
together
almost
a
brother
sir
he
was
called
philip
i
am
called
jack
myself
he
was
a
fine
big
fellow
i
have
always
been
heavy
and
there
was
never
a
better
workman
than
he
while
i
am
only
a
and
so
generous
and
wearing
his
heart
on
his
sleeve
i
was
proud
to
be
his
friend
to
walk
by
his
side
proud
when
he
clapped
me
on
the
back
and
called
me
a
clumsy
fellow
i
loved
him
because
i
admired
him
in
fact
once
here
what
an
opportunity
we
worked
together
for
the
same
employer
but
he
left
me
alone
in
the
evenings
more
than
half
the
time
he
preferred
to
amuse
himself
with
his
companions
natural
enough
at
his
age
he
loved
pleasure
he
was
free
he
had
no
responsibilities
all
this
was
impossible
for
me
i
was
forced
to
save
my
money
for
at
that
time
i
had
an
invalid
mother
in
the
country
and
i
sent
her
all
my
savings
as
for
me
i
stayed
at
the
fruiterer
where
i
lodged
and
who
kept
a
for
masons
philip
did
not
dine
there
he
used
to
go
somewhere
else
and
to
tell
the
truth
the
dinners
were
not
particularly
good
but
the
fruiterer
was
a
widow
far
from
happy
and
i
saw
that
my
payments
were
of
help
to
her
and
then
to
be
frank
i
fell
at
once
in
love
with
her
daughter
poor
catherine
you
will
soon
know
monsieur
le
curé
what
came
from
it
all
i
was
there
three
years
without
daring
to
tell
her
of
the
love
i
had
for
her
i
have
told
you
that
i
am
not
a
good
workman
and
the
little
that
i
gained
hardly
sufficed
for
me
and
for
the
support
of
my
mother
there
could
be
no
thought
of
marrying
at
last
my
good
mother
left
this
world
for
a
better
i
was
somewhat
less
pressed
for
money
and
i
began
to
save
and
when
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
enough
to
begin
with
i
told
catherine
of
my
love
she
said
nothing
at
first
neither
yes
nor
no
well
i
knew
that
no
one
would
fall
upon
my
neck
i
am
not
attractive
in
the
mean
time
catherine
consulted
her
mother
who
thought
well
of
me
as
a
steady
workman
as
a
good
fellow
and
the
marriage
was
decided
upon
ah
i
had
some
happy
weeks
i
saw
that
catherine
barely
accepted
me
and
that
she
was
by
no
means
carried
away
with
me
but
as
she
had
a
good
heart
i
hoped
that
she
would
love
me
some
day
i
would
make
her
love
me
as
a
matter
of
course
i
told
everything
to
philip
whom
i
saw
every
day
at
the
and
as
catherine
and
i
were
engaged
i
wanted
him
to
meet
her
perhaps
you
have
already
guessed
the
end
monsieur
le
curé
philip
was
handsome
lively
everything
that
i
was
not
and
without
attempting
it
innocently
enough
he
fascinated
catherine
ah
catherine
had
a
frank
and
honest
heart
and
as
soon
as
she
recognized
what
had
happened
she
at
once
told
me
everything
ah
i
can
never
forget
that
moment
it
was
catherine
birthday
and
in
honor
of
it
i
had
bought
a
little
cross
of
gold
which
i
had
arranged
in
a
box
with
cotton
we
were
alone
in
the
back
shop
and
she
had
just
brought
me
my
soup
i
took
my
box
from
my
pocket
and
opening
it
i
showed
her
the
jewel
then
she
burst
into
tears
illustration
me
jack
she
said
keep
that
for
her
whom
you
will
marry
as
for
me
i
can
never
become
your
wife
i
love
another
i
love
philip
iv
believe
me
i
had
trouble
enough
then
monsieur
le
curé
my
soul
was
full
of
it
but
what
could
i
do
since
i
loved
them
both
only
what
i
believed
was
for
their
happiness
let
them
marry
and
as
philip
had
always
lived
freely
and
spent
as
he
made
i
lent
him
my
hoard
to
buy
the
furniture
then
they
were
married
and
for
a
while
all
went
well
they
had
a
little
boy
and
i
stood
sponsor
for
him
and
named
him
camille
in
remembrance
of
his
mother
it
was
a
little
after
the
birth
of
the
baby
that
philip
began
to
go
wrong
i
was
mistaken
in
him
he
was
not
made
for
marriage
he
was
too
fond
of
frivolity
and
pleasure
you
live
in
a
poor
quarter
monsieur
le
curé
and
you
must
know
the
sad
story
by
heart
the
workman
who
glides
little
by
little
from
idleness
into
drunkenness
who
is
off
on
a
spree
for
two
or
three
days
who
does
not
bring
home
his
week
wages
and
who
only
returns
to
his
home
broken
up
by
his
spree
to
make
scenes
and
to
beat
his
wife
in
less
than
two
years
philip
became
one
of
these
wretches
at
first
i
tried
to
reform
him
and
sometimes
ashamed
of
himself
he
would
attempt
to
do
better
but
that
did
not
last
long
then
my
remonstrances
only
irritated
him
and
when
i
went
to
his
house
and
he
saw
me
look
sadly
around
the
chamber
made
bare
by
the
at
poor
catherine
thin
and
pale
with
grief
he
became
furious
one
day
he
had
the
audacity
to
be
jealous
of
me
on
account
of
his
wife
who
was
as
pure
as
the
blessed
virgin
reminding
me
that
i
was
once
her
lover
and
accusing
me
of
still
being
so
with
slanders
and
infamies
that
i
should
be
ashamed
to
repeat
we
almost
flew
at
each
other
throats
i
saw
what
i
must
do
i
would
see
catherine
and
my
godson
no
more
and
as
for
philip
i
would
only
meet
him
when
by
chance
we
worked
on
the
same
job
only
you
will
understand
i
loved
catherine
and
little
camille
too
well
to
lose
sight
of
them
entirely
on
saturday
evenings
when
i
knew
that
philip
was
drinking
up
his
wages
with
his
comrades
i
used
to
prowl
about
the
quarter
and
chat
with
the
boy
when
i
found
him
and
if
it
was
too
miserable
at
home
he
did
not
return
with
empty
hands
you
know
i
believe
that
the
wretched
philip
knew
that
i
was
helping
his
wife
and
that
he
closed
his
eyes
to
the
fact
finding
it
rather
convenient
i
will
hurry
on
for
the
story
is
too
miserable
some
years
have
passed
philip
plunging
deeper
in
vice
but
catherine
whom
i
had
helped
all
i
could
has
educated
her
son
who
is
now
a
fellow
of
twenty
years
good
and
courageous
like
herself
he
is
not
a
workman
he
is
educated
he
has
learned
to
draw
at
the
evening
schools
and
he
is
now
with
an
architect
where
he
gets
good
wages
and
though
the
house
is
saddened
by
the
presence
of
the
drunkard
things
go
fairly
well
for
camille
is
a
great
comfort
to
his
mother
and
for
a
year
or
two
when
i
see
catherine
she
is
so
changed
the
poor
woman
leaning
on
the
arm
of
her
manly
son
it
warms
my
heart
but
yesterday
evening
coming
out
of
my
i
met
camille
and
shaking
hands
with
him
oh
he
is
not
ashamed
of
me
and
he
blush
at
a
blouse
covered
with
plaster
i
saw
that
something
was
the
matter
see
what
the
matter
now
drew
the
lot
yesterday
he
replied
i
drew
the
number
ten
a
number
that
sends
you
to
die
with
fever
in
the
colonies
with
the
marines
that
will
at
all
events
send
me
there
for
five
years
to
leave
mother
alone
without
resources
with
father
who
has
never
been
drinking
so
much
who
has
never
been
so
wicked
and
it
will
kill
her
it
will
kill
her
how
cursed
it
is
to
be
poor
oh
what
a
horrible
night
i
passed
think
of
it
monsieur
le
curé
that
poor
woman
labor
for
twenty
years
destroyed
in
a
minute
by
an
unhappy
chance
because
a
child
rummaging
in
a
sack
has
drawn
an
unfortunate
number
in
the
morning
i
was
broken
as
by
age
when
i
went
to
the
house
we
were
building
on
the
boulevard
arago
of
what
use
is
sorrow
we
must
work
all
the
same
so
i
mounted
the
scaffolding
we
had
already
built
the
house
to
the
fourth
story
and
i
began
to
place
my
mortar
suddenly
i
felt
some
one
strike
me
on
the
shoulder
it
was
philip
he
only
worked
now
when
the
inclination
seized
him
and
he
was
apparently
putting
in
a
day
work
to
get
something
to
drink
but
the
builder
having
a
forfeit
to
pay
if
the
building
was
not
finished
by
a
certain
date
accepted
the
i
had
not
seen
philip
for
a
long
time
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
i
recognized
him
burned
and
fevered
by
brandy
his
beard
gray
his
hands
trembling
he
was
more
than
an
old
man
he
was
a
ruin
i
said
to
him
boy
has
drawn
a
bad
number
of
it
he
replied
with
an
angry
look
you
going
to
worry
me
about
that
too
like
catherine
and
camille
the
boy
will
do
as
others
have
done
he
will
serve
his
country
i
know
what
worries
them
both
my
wife
and
son
if
i
were
dead
he
would
not
have
to
go
but
so
much
the
worse
for
them
i
am
still
solid
at
my
post
and
camille
is
not
the
son
of
a
widow
the
son
of
a
widow
ah
monsieur
le
curé
why
did
he
use
that
unhappy
phrase
the
evil
thought
came
to
me
at
once
and
it
never
quitted
me
all
the
morning
that
i
worked
at
the
wretch
side
i
imagined
all
that
she
was
about
to
suffer
poor
catherine
when
she
no
longer
had
her
son
to
care
for
and
protect
her
and
she
must
be
alone
with
the
miserable
drunkard
now
completely
brutalized
ugly
and
capable
of
anything
a
neighboring
clock
struck
eleven
and
the
workmen
all
descended
to
lunch
we
remained
until
the
last
philip
and
i
but
in
stepping
on
the
ladder
to
descend
he
turned
to
me
with
a
leer
and
said
in
his
hoarse
dissipated
voice
see
steady
as
a
sailor
camille
is
not
nearly
the
son
of
a
widow
the
blood
mounted
to
my
head
i
was
beside
myself
i
seized
with
both
hands
the
rounds
of
the
ladder
to
which
philip
clung
shouting
and
with
a
single
effort
i
toppled
it
over
he
was
instantly
killed
by
an
accident
they
said
and
now
camille
is
the
son
of
a
widow
and
need
not
go
that
is
what
i
have
done
monsieur
le
curé
and
what
i
want
to
tell
to
you
and
to
the
good
god
i
repent
i
ask
pardon
of
course
but
i
must
not
see
catherine
in
her
black
dress
happy
on
the
arm
of
her
son
or
i
could
not
regret
my
crime
to
prevent
that
i
will
emigrate
i
will
lose
myself
in
america
as
to
my
penance
see
monsieur
le
curé
here
is
the
little
cross
of
gold
that
catherine
refused
when
she
told
me
that
she
was
in
love
with
philip
i
have
always
kept
it
in
memory
of
the
only
happy
days
that
i
ever
knew
in
my
life
take
it
and
sell
it
give
the
money
to
the
poor
jack
rose
absolved
by
the
abbé
faber
one
thing
is
certain
and
that
is
that
the
priest
never
sold
the
little
cross
of
gold
after
having
paid
its
price
into
the
treasury
of
the
church
he
hung
the
jewel
as
an
on
the
altar
of
the
chapel
of
the
virgin
where
he
often
went
to
pray
for
the
poor
mason

a
christmas
story
once
upon
a
time
it
was
so
long
ago
that
the
whole
world
has
forgotten
the
date
in
a
city
in
the
north
of
europe
whose
name
is
so
difficult
to
pronounce
that
nobody
remembers
it
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
little
boy
of
seven
named
wolff
an
orphan
in
charge
of
an
old
aunt
who
was
hard
and
avaricious
who
only
embraced
him
on
day
and
who
breathed
a
sigh
of
regret
every
time
that
she
gave
him
a
porringer
of
soup
but
the
poor
little
chap
was
naturally
so
good
that
he
loved
the
old
woman
just
the
same
although
she
frightened
him
very
much
and
he
could
never
see
without
trembling
the
great
wart
ornamented
with
four
gray
hairs
which
she
had
on
the
end
of
her
nose
as
the
aunt
of
wolff
was
known
through
all
the
village
to
have
a
house
and
an
old
stocking
full
of
gold
she
did
not
dare
send
her
nephew
to
the
school
for
the
poor
but
she
so
schemed
to
obtain
a
reduction
of
the
price
with
the
whose
school
little
wolff
attended
that
the
bad
teacher
vexed
at
having
a
scholar
so
badly
dressed
and
who
paid
so
poorly
punished
him
very
often
and
unjustly
with
the
backboard
and
fool
cap
and
even
stirred
his
against
him
all
sons
of
men
who
made
the
orphan
their
scapegoat
the
poor
little
fellow
was
therefore
as
miserable
as
the
stones
in
the
street
and
hid
himself
in
corners
to
cry
when
christmas
came
the
night
before
christmas
the
was
to
take
all
of
his
pupils
to
the
midnight
mass
and
bring
them
back
to
their
homes
now
as
the
winter
was
very
severe
that
year
and
as
for
several
days
a
great
quantity
of
snow
had
fallen
the
scholars
came
to
the
rendezvous
warmly
wrapped
and
bundled
up
with
fur
caps
pulled
down
over
their
ears
double
and
triple
jackets
knitted
gloves
and
mittens
and
good
thick
nailed
boots
with
strong
soles
only
little
wolff
came
shivering
in
the
clothes
that
he
wore
and
sundays
and
with
nothing
on
his
feet
but
coarse
strasbourg
socks
and
heavy
sabots
or
wooden
shoes
his
thoughtless
comrades
made
a
thousand
jests
over
his
sad
looks
and
his
peasant
dress
but
the
orphan
was
so
occupied
in
blowing
on
his
fingers
and
suffered
so
much
from
his
chilblains
that
he
took
no
notice
of
them
and
the
troop
of
boys
with
the
master
at
their
head
started
for
the
church
illustration
it
was
fine
in
the
church
which
was
resplendent
with
and
the
scholars
excited
by
the
pleasant
warmth
profited
by
the
noise
of
the
organ
and
the
singing
to
talk
to
each
other
in
a
low
voice
they
boasted
of
the
fine
suppers
that
were
waiting
for
them
at
home
the
son
of
the
burgomaster
had
seen
before
he
went
out
a
monstrous
goose
that
the
truffles
marked
with
black
spots
like
a
leopard
at
the
house
of
the
first
citizen
there
was
a
little
in
a
wooden
box
from
whose
branches
hung
oranges
sweetmeats
and
toys
and
the
cook
of
the
first
citizen
had
pinned
behind
her
back
the
two
strings
of
her
cap
as
she
only
did
on
her
days
of
inspiration
when
she
was
sure
of
succeeding
with
her
famous
and
then
the
scholars
spoke
too
of
what
the
would
bring
to
them
of
what
he
would
put
in
their
shoes
which
they
would
of
course
be
very
careful
to
leave
in
the
chimney
before
going
to
bed
and
the
eyes
of
those
little
chaps
lively
as
a
parcel
of
mice
sparkled
in
advance
with
the
joy
of
seeing
in
their
imagination
pink
paper
bags
of
burnt
almonds
lead
soldiers
drawn
up
in
battalions
in
their
boxes
menageries
smelling
of
varnished
wood
and
magnificent
covered
with
purple
and
bells
little
wolff
knew
very
well
by
experience
that
his
old
miserly
aunt
would
send
him
supperless
to
bed
but
in
the
simplicity
of
his
soul
and
knowing
that
he
had
been
all
the
year
as
good
and
industrious
as
possible
he
hoped
that
the
would
not
forget
him
and
he
too
looked
eagerly
forward
to
putting
his
wooden
shoes
in
the
ashes
of
the
fireplace
the
midnight
mass
concluded
the
faithful
went
away
anxious
for
supper
and
the
band
of
scholars
walking
two
by
two
after
their
teacher
left
the
church
now
under
the
porch
sitting
on
a
stone
seat
under
a
gothic
niche
a
child
was
sleeping
a
child
covered
by
a
robe
of
white
linen
and
whose
feet
were
bare
notwithstanding
the
cold
he
was
not
a
beggar
for
his
robe
was
new
and
nice
and
near
him
on
the
ground
were
seen
lying
in
a
cloth
a
square
a
hatchet
a
pair
of
compasses
and
the
other
tools
of
a
carpenter
apprentice
under
the
light
of
the
stars
his
face
with
its
closed
eyes
bore
an
expression
of
divine
sweetness
and
his
long
locks
of
golden
hair
seemed
like
an
about
his
head
but
the
child
feet
blue
in
the
cold
of
that
december
night
were
sad
to
see
illustration
the
scholars
so
well
clothed
and
shod
for
the
winter
passed
heedlessly
before
the
unknown
child
one
of
them
even
the
son
of
one
of
the
principal
men
in
the
village
looked
at
the
waif
with
an
expression
in
which
could
be
seen
all
the
scorn
of
the
rich
for
the
poor
the
for
the
hungry
but
little
wolff
coming
the
last
out
of
the
church
stopped
full
of
compassion
before
the
beautiful
sleeping
infant
alas
said
the
orphan
to
himself
it
is
too
bad
this
poor
little
one
going
barefoot
in
such
bad
weather
but
what
is
worse
than
all
he
has
not
even
a
boot
or
a
wooden
shoe
to
leave
before
him
while
he
sleeps
so
that
the
could
put
something
there
to
comfort
him
in
his
misery
and
carried
away
by
the
goodness
of
his
heart
little
wolff
took
off
the
wooden
shoe
from
his
right
foot
and
laid
it
in
front
of
the
sleeping
child
and
then
as
best
he
could
limping
along
on
his
poor
blistered
foot
and
dragging
his
sock
through
the
snow
he
went
back
to
his
aunt
look
at
the
worthless
fellow
cried
his
aunt
full
of
anger
at
his
return
without
one
of
his
shoes
what
have
you
done
with
your
wooden
shoe
little
wretch
little
wolff
did
not
know
how
to
deceive
and
although
he
was
shaking
with
terror
at
seeing
the
gray
hairs
bristle
up
on
the
nose
of
the
angry
woman
he
tried
to
stammer
out
some
account
of
his
adventure
but
the
old
woman
burst
into
a
frightful
peal
of
laughter
ah
monsieur
takes
off
his
shoes
for
beggars
ah
monsieur
gives
away
his
wooden
shoe
to
a
barefoot
that
is
something
new
for
example
ah
well
since
that
is
so
i
am
going
to
put
the
wooden
shoe
which
you
have
left
in
the
chimney
and
i
promise
you
the
will
leave
there
something
to
whip
you
with
in
the
morning
and
you
shall
pass
the
day
on
dry
bread
and
water
we
will
see
if
next
time
you
give
away
your
shoes
to
the
first
vagabond
that
comes
and
the
wicked
woman
after
having
given
the
poor
boy
a
couple
of
slaps
made
him
climb
up
to
his
bed
in
the
attic
grieved
to
the
heart
the
child
went
to
bed
in
the
dark
and
soon
went
to
sleep
on
his
pillow
steeped
with
tears
but
on
the
morrow
morning
when
the
old
woman
awakened
by
the
cold
and
shaken
by
her
cough
went
down
stairs
oh
wonderful
sight
she
saw
the
great
chimney
full
of
beautiful
playthings
and
sacks
of
magnificent
candies
and
all
sorts
of
good
things
and
before
all
these
splendid
things
the
right
shoe
that
her
nephew
had
given
to
the
little
waif
stood
by
the
side
of
the
left
shoe
that
she
herself
had
put
there
that
very
night
and
where
she
meant
to
put
a
and
as
little
wolff
running
down
to
learn
the
meaning
of
his
exclamation
stood
in
artless
ecstasy
before
all
these
splendid
christmas
presents
suddenly
there
were
loud
cries
of
laughter
the
old
woman
and
the
little
boy
went
out
to
know
what
it
all
meant
and
saw
all
the
neighbors
gathered
around
the
public
fountain
what
had
happened
oh
something
very
amusing
and
very
extraordinary
the
children
of
all
the
rich
people
of
the
village
those
whose
parents
had
wished
to
surprise
them
by
the
most
beautiful
gifts
had
found
only
rods
in
their
shoes
then
the
orphan
and
the
old
woman
thinking
of
all
the
beautiful
things
that
were
in
their
chimney
were
full
of
amazement
but
presently
they
saw
the
curé
coming
with
wonder
in
his
face
above
the
seat
placed
near
the
door
of
the
church
at
the
same
place
where
in
the
evening
a
child
clad
in
a
white
robe
and
with
feet
bare
notwithstanding
the
cold
had
rested
his
sleeping
head
the
priest
had
just
seen
a
circle
of
gold
incrusted
with
precious
stones
and
they
all
crossed
themselves
devoutly
comprehending
that
the
beautiful
sleeping
child
near
whom
were
the
carpenter
tools
was
jesus
of
nazareth
in
person
become
for
an
hour
such
as
he
was
when
he
worked
in
his
parents
house
and
they
bowed
themselves
before
that
miracle
that
the
good
god
had
seen
fit
to
work
to
reward
the
faith
and
charity
of

pretty
madame

in
a
black

with
her
hair
in
sober
braids
was
writing
steadily
in
an

her

following
his

custom
stopped
at
the
door

scold
his
workmen

had
not
finished
unloading
a
dray
from
the
northern

blocked

those
peasants
the
druggist

silent
for
a
moment
rubbing
his
thick
blond
beard

bayard
as
caring

if

by
his
clerks

leaned
towards
his

kissed
her
forehead

the

by
his
in
in
the
rue
vieille

and
had
espoused
the
daughter
of
the
to
of
the
rue
des
lombards
an
establishment
which
dated
from
the
first
empire
as
was
shown
by
the
sign
copied
from
the
celebrated
painting
of
guérin
honest
people
excellent
people
and
there
are
many
more
like
them
whatever
folks
may
say
among
the
older
paris
houses
conservators
of
old
traditions
going
to
the
second
tier
on
sunday
at
the
opera
comique
and
ignorant
of
false
weights
and
measures
it
was
the
curé
of
who
had
managed
that
marriage
with
his
confrère
of
the
first
had
ministered
at
the
of
the
elder
bayard
and
was
dismayed
to
see
a
young
man
of
all
alone
in
a
house
so
gloomy
as
that
of
silver
justly
famed
for
its
ipecac
and
the
second
was
anxious
to
establish
mademoiselle
simonin
to
whom
he
had
administered
her
first
communion

whose
father
was
one
of
his
most
important
parishioners
old
simonin
of
the
to
celebrated
for
its
camphor
the
negotiations
were
successful
camphor
and
ipecac
two
excellent
specialties
were
united
in
the
holy
bonds
of
matrimony
there
was
a
dinner
and
ball
at
the
grand
véfour
and
now
for
ten
years
tranquilly
working
every
day
summer
and
winter
in
her
glass
cage
madame
bayard
with
her
pale
brown
face
and
her
plaited
hair
had
smitten
the
hearts
of
all
the
young
clerks
of
the
quarter
de
la
bretonnerie
and
yet
for
a
long
time
there
had
been
a
disappointment
in
that
happy
household
a
cloud
in
that
bright
sky
an
heir
was
wanted
and
it
was
five
years
before
little
leon
came
into
the
world
one
can
imagine
with
what
joy
he
was
received
now
one
day
they
might
write
over
the
door
of
silver
these
words
bayard
son
but
as
the
infant
arrived
at
the
time
of
a
boom
in
isinglass
madame
bayard
whose
presence
in
the
shop
was
indispensable
could
not
think
of
nursing
him
she
even
gave
up
the
idea
of
taking
a
nurse
in
the
house
fearing
for
the
the
close
air
of
that
corner
of
old
paris
and
contented
herself
with
taking
every
sunday
with
her
husband
a
little
excursion
to
argenteuil
to
see
her
son
with
his
nurse
voisin
who
was
overwhelmed
with
coffee
sugar
soap
and
other
dainties
at
the
end
of
eighteen
months
mother
voisin
brought
back
the
baby
in
a
magnificent
state
and
for
two
years
a
child
nurse
chosen
with
great
care
had
taken
the
child
out
for
his
airings
in
the
square
of
the
tour
and
had
exhibited
for
the
admiration
of
her
the
pouting
lips
the
high
color
and
the
dimpled
back
of
the
future
druggist
and
now
these
good
bayards
learning
of
the
death
of
mother
voisin
could
not
bear
the
thought
that
the
little
girl
who
had
been
nourished
at
the
same
breast
with
their
boy
should
be
abandoned
to
public
charity
so
they
went
to
argenteuil
for
norine
poor
little
one
since
the
fifteen
days
that
her
mother
slept
in
the
cemetery
she
had
been
taken
charge
of
by
a
cousin
who
kept
a
and
though
she
was
not
yet
five
years
old
she
had
been
put
to
work
washing
the
illustration
the
bayards
found
her
charming
with
great
eyes
as
blue
as
the
summer
sun
and
her
thick
blond
tresses
escaping
from
her
ugly
black
bonnet
leon
who
had
been
brought
with
his
nurse
embraced
his
foster
sister
and
the
cousin
who
that
very
morning
had
boxed
the
orphan
ears
for
negligence
in
sweeping
out
the
hall
appeared
before
the
parisians
to
be
as
much
touched
as
if
parting
with
norine
was
a
affair
the
order
for
an
ample
breakfast
restored
his
serenity
it
was
a
beautiful
sunday
in
june
and
they
were
in
the
country
an
occasion
which
should
be
improved
declared
bayard
by
taking
the
air
should
it
mimi
and
while
pretty
madame
bayard
having
pinned
up
her
skirts
went
out
with
the
children
and
the
nurse
to
pick
flowers
in
a
neighboring
field
the
druggist
who
was
less
ambitious
treated
the
cousin
to
a
glass
of
vermouth
seated
at
the
which
was
covered
with
dead
flies
they
breakfasted
under
a
vineless
arbor
which
the
hot
noonday
sun
riddled
with
its
rays
but
what
of
that
they
were
pleased
and
contented
all
the
same
madame
bayard
had
hung
her
hat
on
the
lattice
and
her
husband
wearing
a
bargeman
straw
helmet
which
had
been
lent
to
him
by
the
cut
up
the
duck
in
the
best
of
spirits
little
leon
and
norine
who
had
immediately
become
the
best
of
friends
emptied
the
of
its
then
they
all
romped
in
the
grass
went
boating
on
the
stream
and
intoxicated
with
the
fresh
country
air
the
indwellers
of
the
city
coming
from
the
close
paris
streets
pushed
to
its
fullest
extreme
this
idyl
in
the
fashion
of
paul
de
kock
illustration
for
yes
there
was
a
moment
as
they
came
back
in
the
boat
in
a
delicious
sunset
when
tinted
clouds
floated
in
a
glowing
sky
when
madame
bayard
the
serious
madame
bayard
whose
frown
turned
to
stone
the
of
the
druggist
sang
the
air
called
to
the
shores
of
france
to
the
rhythmic
fall
of
the
oars
plied
by
her
husband
in
his
they
dined
in
the
arbor
where
they
had
breakfasted
but
the
second
repast
was
a
shade
less
happy
the
which
dashed
in
to
burn
themselves
at
the
candles
frightened
the
children
and
madame
bayard
was
so
tired
that
she
could
not
even
guess
the
simple
rebus
on
her
dessert
napkin
never
mind
it
has
been
a
good
day
and
on
their
return
in
a
carriage
this
was
not
a
time
for
petty
economies
madame
bayard
with
her
head
on
her
husband
shoulder
watching
leon
and
norine
limp
with
sleep
on
the
lap
of
the
nurse
half
asleep
herself
murmured
to
her
husband
in
a
happy
voice
see
ferdinand
we
have
done
well
to
take
the
little
one
she
will
be
a
comrade
for
leon
they
will
be
like
brother
and
sister
iii
in
fact
they
did
thus
grow
up
together
they
were
most
people
these
bayards
they
made
no
difference
between
the
humble
orphan
and
their
own
dear
boy
who
would
one
day
in
the
firm
of
bayard
son
work
monopolies
in
rhubarb
and
corners
in
indeed
they
loved
as
their
own
child
little
norine
who
was
as
intelligent
as
she
was
charming
as
fair
in
mind
as
she
was
delicate
in
body
now
the
nurse
took
the
two
children
to
the
square
of
the
tour
when
the
weather
was
pleasant
and
in
the
evening
at
the
family
table
there
were
two
side
by
side
for
the
boy
and
his
foster
sister
in
addition
to
which
the
bayards
were
not
slow
to
perceive
the
good
influence
which
norine
had
upon
leon
quicker
of
a
more
nervous
temperament
more
easy
of
comprehension
than
the
lymphatic
boy
whose
wits
were
according
to
his
father
she
seemed
to
communicate
to
him
something
of
her
own
spirit
and
fire
she
jogs
him
up
said
madame
bayard
and
since
he
had
lived
with
his
foster
sister
leon
had
perceptibly
grown
brighter
and
quicker
when
they
were
of
an
age
to
learn
to
read
leon
who
made
but
little
progress
and
stumbled
along
with
one
of
those
alphabets
with
pictures
where
the
letter
e
is
by
the
side
of
an
elephant
and
the
letter
z
by
the
side
of
a
zouave
was
the
despair
of
his
mother
but
as
soon
as
norine
who
in
a
very
short
time
learned
to
spell
and
read
came
to
the
aid
of
the
little
man
he
immediately
made
rapid
progress
so
things
went
on
until
both
children
were
sent
to
a
school
for
little
children
kept
by
a
gentlewoman
named
merlin
in
the
rue
de
armé
according
to
the
fallacious
circular
which
mademoiselle
merlin
sent
to
the
folks
of
the
quarter
there
was
a
garden
that
is
to
say
four
broomsticks
in
a
sandy
court
and
it
was
there
the
first
day
during
recess
that
the
innocent
leon
burst
into
cries
of
terror
when
he
saw
the
forced
by
some
accident
to
interrupt
her
knitting
stick
one
of
her
great
in
her
capacious
a
senior
who
was
more
familiar
with
her
explained
the
phenomenon
in
vain
to
leon
and
norine
for
the
boy
none
the
less
preserved
in
the
presence
of
mademoiselle
merlin
an
impression
of
superstitious
terror
illustration
she
would
have
paralyzed
his
infant
faculties
and
have
prevented
him
in
the
class
from
following
the
pointer
of
mademoiselle
merlin
as
she
sniffled
through
her
lecture
before
the
map
of
europe
or
the
table
of
weights
and
measures
if
norine
had
not
been
there
to
reassure
and
encourage
him
she
was
at
once
the
first
scholar
in
the
school
and
became
for
slow
and
lazy
leon
a
sort
of
sisterly
counsellor
and
affectionate
towards
four
madame
bayard
had
the
two
children
whom
the
nurse
had
brought
back
to
the
store
placed
near
her
in
the
glass
office
and
norine
opening
a
or
a
book
explained
to
leon
the
uncomprehended
task
or
made
him
repeat
the
lesson
that
he
had
not
understood
the
good
god
has
rewarded
us
madame
bayard
sometimes
whispered
to
her
husband
in
the
evening
that
little
norine
is
a
treasure
and
so
good
so
industrious
only
i
listened
to
her
helping
leon
again
i
believe
that
without
her
he
would
never
have
learned
the
i
believe
you
mimi
responded
bayard
i
have
observed
it
things
go
on
marvellously
well
with
us
and
we
will
portion
her
and
marry
her
shall
we
not
when
she
comes
to
a
suitable
age
iv
age
comes
ah
how
fast
age
comes
and
behold
now
in
the
glass
cage
of
the
shop
there
is
a
slender
and
beautiful
young
girl
sitting
at
the
side
of
madame
bayard
who
already
shows
some
silver
threads
in
her
black
bands
it
is
norine
now
who
writes
in
the
great
ledger
with
leather
corners
while
her
adopted
mother
plies
her
needles
on
some
embroidery
seven
time
that
they
came
home
and
the
shop
must
be
closed
against
the
november
wind
which
is
twisting
and
turning
the
flames
of
the
look
at
them
now
bayard
grown
stout
portly
and
covered
with
trinkets
while
leon
who
has
just
entered
the
first
class
in
pharmacy
has
actually
become
a
young
fellow
mimi
norine
let
us
go
right
in
to
dinner
i
will
tell
you
all
the
news
while
we
are
eating
the
soup
said
the
druggist
they
went
up
to
the
and
while
madame
bayard
sitting
under
a
barometer
in
the
shape
of
a
lyre
served
the
thick
soup
bayard
tucking
his
napkin
in
his
vest
and
regarding
his
wife
with
a
knowing
look
said
you
know
it
is
all
right
the
forgets
agree
exactly
and
leon
will
espouse
hortense
in
six
months
and
our
will
come
and
live
with
us
yes
norine
you
have
known
nothing
about
it
because
one
does
not
speak
of
such
things
before
young
girls
but
for
more
than
a
year
leon
has
been
in
love
with
hortense
forget
and
has
been
teasing
us
to
arrange
the
marriage
not
such
a
difficult
thing
after
all
since
it
only
required
a
word
leon
is
a
good
catch
the
only
difficulty
was
that
we
wanted
to
keep
our
son
with
us
at
last
it
is
all
arranged
and
your
foster
brother
will
have
the
wife
he
wants
i
hope
you
are
pleased
very
much
pleased
replied
norine
oh
deaf
and
blind
they
never
heard
the
voice
of
norine
when
she
replied
to
them
that
low
pathetic
tone
which
is
the
echo
of
a
broken
heart
nor
did
they
see
how
pale
she
became
and
that
her
head
suddenly
grown
heavy
swayed
from
side
to
side
as
if
norine
were
about
to
faint
they
saw
nothing
comprehended
nothing
and
for
a
long
time
they
had
seen
and
comprehended
nothing
yet
they
dearly
loved
this
norine
who
was
the
grace
the
charm
of
the
house
they
dreamed
these
good
people
of
marrying
her
one
of
these
days
to
their
a
widower
of
prudent
and
economical
habits
and
all
that
is
necessary
to
make
a
woman
happy
leon
loved
her
too
with
all
his
heart
but
as
a
dear
good
sister
nor
did
the
great
spoiled
boy
suspect
that
norine
loved
him
and
suffered
from
her
love
aye
to
death
itself
no
even
that
evening
when
they
had
unconsciously
inflicted
upon
her
the
worst
of
torture
they
never
suspected
the
truth
and
they
would
sleep
peacefully
indulging
in
beautiful
dreams
of
the
future
at
the
very
hour
when
shut
in
her
chamber
the
chamber
separated
by
such
a
thin
partition
from
that
of
her
adopted
parents
norine
would
fall
upon
her
bed
fainting
with
grief
and
bury
her
head
in
her
pillow
to
stifle
her
sobs
the
ball
is
finished
and
in
the
empty
rooms
the
candles
burned
to
the
very
end
have
broken
some
of
the
sconces
and
the
fragments
lie
upon
the
waxed
floors
the
bayards
have
insisted
that
the
wedding
should
be
celebrated
at
their
house
but
by
the
aid
of
many
flowers
it
is
midsummer
they
have
given
a
holiday
appearance
to
the
apartment
in
the
rue
vieille
du
temple
where
they
have
triumphantly
installed
their
at
last
it
is
finished
the
young
couple
have
retired
to
their
nuptial
chamber
where
madame
bayard
has
gone
for
a
moment
with
them
coming
out
she
found
norine
still
in
the
little
salon
helping
the
servants
extinguish
the
lights
she
embraced
the
young
girl
tenderly
saying
go
to
bed
my
child
you
must
be
very
tired
and
she
added
with
a
smile
well
it
will
be
your
turn
before
long
and
norine
was
at
last
alone
in
the
room
now
so
gloomy
and
lighted
only
by
her
single
candle
resting
on
the
piano
heavens
how
heavy
was
the
odor
of
the
flowers
and
how
her
head
ached
ah
that
horrible
day
what
torment
she
had
endured
since
the
moment
when
she
knelt
impressed
into
service
as
a
with
pins
in
her
lips
at
the
feet
of
her
rival
hortense
and
arranged
her
white
satin
train
to
the
hour
when
leon
holding
his
wife
by
the
waist
drew
her
towards
her
norine
and
the
lips
of
the
young
couple
met
almost
upon
her
very
forehead
illustration
oh
the
odor
of
the
flowers
is
insupportable
and
she
is
so
giddy
and
faint
she
fell
upon
a
sofa
unnerved
by
a
frightful
headache
her
head
thrown
back
clasping
her
forehead
with
her
two
hands
but
with
open
eyes
staring
always
at
the
door
the
door
of
that
chamber
which
was
shut
upon
the
young
couple
closed
upon
the
mystery
which
was
breaking
her
heart
a
sort
of
delirium
overwhelmed
her
how
the
heavy
perfume
of
those
flowers
overpowered
her
and
how
a
thousand
memories
assailed
her
at
once
she
was
a
child
again
in
the
saloon
at
argenteuil
and
the
kind
parisians
came
and
caressed

was
embraced
by
the
dear
little
boy
wearing
a
white
plume
in
his
hat
rapid

flashed
upon
her
soul

shutters
closed

she
playing
catch

leon

the
barrels

sacks
good
god
was
she
losing
her
head
she
could
not
help
humming
that
waltz
during
which
leon
once
held
her
in
his
arms
she
was
stifled
oh
the
flowers
she
must
go
out
or
at
least
open
a
window
but
she
could
not
rise
her
strength
had
deserted
her
could
she
die
thus
two
iron
fingers
seemed
to
be
pressing
her
temples
oh
the
roses
and
the
those
above
all
at
last
she
made
a
great
effort
she
rose
upright
and
pale
pale
as
her
white
robe
but
suddenly
her
strength
left
her
and
falling
first
upon
her
knees
and
then
with
her
head
and
shoulders
upon
the
wood
floor
poor
norine
lay
stretched
at
the
threshold
of
the
bridal
chamber

by
disappointed
love

my

illustration
my
friend
meurtier
i
was
at
one
time
employed
in
a
government
office
every
day
from
ten
until
four
i
became
a
voluntary
prisoner
in
a
depressing
office
adorned
with
yellow
pasteboard
boxes
and
filled
with
the
musty
odor
of
old
papers
there
i
lunched
on
italian
cheese
and
apples
which
i
roasted
at
the
grate
i
read
the
morning
papers
even
to
the
advertisements
i
rhymed
verses
and
i
attended
to
the
affairs
of
state
to
the
extent
of
drawing
at
the
end
of
each
month
a
salary
which
barely
kept
me
from
starving
i
recall
one
of
my
companions
in
captivity
at
that
epoch
he
was
called
achille
meurtrier
and
certainly
his
fierce
look
and
tall
form
seemed
to
warrant
that
name
he
was
a
great
big
fellow
about
forty
years
old
not
too
much
chest
or
shoulders
but
who
increased
his
apparent
size
by
wearing
felt
hats
with
wide
brims
ample
and
short
coats
large
plaid
trousers
and
neckties
of
a
sanguine
red
under
rolling
collars
he
wore
a
full
beard
long
hair
and
was
very
proud
of
his
hairy
hands
the
chief
boast
of
meurtrier
otherwise
the
best
and
most
amiable
of
companions
was
to
trifle
with
an
athletic
constitution
to
possess
the
biceps
of
a
and
as
he
said
himself
not
to
know
his
own
strength
he
never
made
a
gesture
even
in
the
exercise
of
his
peaceful
profession
that
did
not
have
for
its
object
to
convince
the
spectators
of
his
prodigious
vigor
did
he
have
to
take
from
its
case
a
pasteboard
box
he
advanced
towards
the
shelf
with
the
heavy
step
of
a
street
porter
grasped
the
box
solidly
with
a
tight
hand
and
carried
it
with
a
stiff
arm
as
far
as
the
next
table
with
a
shrugging
of
shoulders
and
frowning
of
brow
worthy
of
milo
of
crotona
he
carried
this
manner
so
far
that
he
never
used
less
apparent
effort
even
to
lift
the
lightest
objects
and
one
day
when
he
held
in
his
right
hand
a
basket
of
old
papers
i
saw
him
extend
his
left
arm
horizontally
as
if
to
make
a
counterpoise
to
the
tremendous
weight
i
ought
to
say
that
this
robust
creature
inspired
me
with
a
profound
respect
for
i
was
then
even
more
than
physically
weak
and
delicate
and
in
consequence
filled
with
admiration
for
that
energetic
physique
which
i
lacked
the
conversations
of
meurtrier
were
not
of
a
nature
to
diminish
the
admiration
with
which
he
inspired
me
in
the
summer
above
all
on
monday
mornings
when
we
had
returned
to
the
office
after
our
sunday
holiday
he
had
an
inexhaustible
fund
of
stories
concerning
his
adventures
and
feats
of
strength
after
taking
off
his
his
coat
and
his
vest
and
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
with
the
sleeve
of
his
shirt
to
indicate
his
sanguine
and
ardent
temperament
he
would
thrust
his
hands
deep
in
the
pockets
of
his
trousers
and
standing
near
me
in
an
attitude
of
perpendicular
solidity
begin
a
monologue
something
as
follows

my

positively
no

to
say
that
my
admiration
for
meurtrier
was
not
unmixed
with
regret
and
bitterness
perhaps
there
was
mingled
with
it
something
of
envy
but
the
recitation
of
his
most
marvellous
exploits
had
never
awakened
in
me
the
least
feeling
of
incredulity
and
achille
meurtrier
easily
took
his
place
in
my
mind
among
heroes
and
demigods
between
roland
and
pirithous
ii
at
this
time
i
was
a
great
wanderer
in
the
suburbs
and
i
occupied
the
leisure
of
my
summer
evenings
by
solitary
walks
in
those
distant
regions
as
unknown
to
the
parisians
of
the
boulevards
as
the
country
of
the
caribbees
and
of
whose
sombre
charm
i
endeavored
later
to
tell
in
verse
one
evening
in
july
hot
and
dusty
at
the
hour
when
the
first
were
beginning
to
twinkle
in
the
misty
twilight
i
was
walking
slowly
from
vaugirard
through
one
of
those
long
and
depressing
suburban
streets
lined
on
each
side
by
houses
of
unequal
height
whose
porters
and
porteresses
in
shirt
sleeves
and
in
calico
sat
on
the
steps
and
imagined
that
they
were
taking
the
fresh
air
hardly
any
one
passing
in
the
whole
street
perhaps
from
end
to
end
a
mason
white
with
plaster
a
a
child
carrying
home
a
loaf
larger
than
himself
or
a
young
girl
hurrying
on
in
hat
and
cloak
with
a
leather
bag
on
her
arm
and
every
the
omnibus
coming
back
to
its
place
of
departure
with
the
heavy
trot
of
its
tired
horses
stumbling
now
and
then
on
the
pavement
for
asphalt
is
an
unknown
luxury
in
these
places
i
went
down
the
street
tasting
all
the
delights
of
a
stroller
sometimes
i
stopped
before
a
vacant
lot
to
watch
through
the
broken
boards
of
the
fence
the
fading
glories
of
the
setting
sun
and
the
black
silhouettes
of
the
chimneys
thrown
against
a
greenish
sky
sometimes
through
an
open
window
on
the
i
caught
sight
of
an
interior
picturesque
and
familiar
here
a
laundress
holding
her
to
her
cheek
there
workmen
sitting
at
tables
and
smoking
in
the
basement
of
a
cabaret
while
an
old
bohemian
with
long
gray
hair
standing
before
them
sang
something
about
liberty
accompanying
himself
on
a
guitar
about
the
color
of
bouillon
the
scenes
of
chardin
and
van
ostade
suddenly
i
stopped
one
of
these
personal
pictures
had
caught
my
eye
by
its
domestic
and
charming
simplicity
illustration
she
looked
so
happy
and
peaceful
in
her
quiet
little
room
the
dear
old
lady
in
her
black
gown
and
widow
cap
leaning
back
in
an
covered
with
green
utrecht
velvet
and
sitting
quietly
with
her
hands
folded
on
her
lap
everything
around
her
was
so
old
and
simple
and
seemed
to
have
been
preserved
less
through
a
wise
economy
than
on
account
of
hallowed
memories
since
the
with
monsieur
of
the
high
complexion
in
a
and
flowered
waistcoat
whose
oval
crayon
ornamented
the
wall
by
two
lamps
on
the
every
detail
of
the
furniture
could
be
distinguished
from
the
clock
on
a
fish
of
artificial
and
painted
marble
to
the
old
and
antiquated
piano
on
which
without
doubt
as
a
young
girl
in
sleeves
and
with
hair
dressed
la
she
had
played
the
airs
of
romagnesi
certainly
a
loved
and
only
daughter
remaining
unmarried
through
her
affection
for
her
mother
piously
watched
over
the
last
years
of
the
widow
it
was
she
i
was
sure
who
had
so
tenderly
placed
her
dear
mother
she
who
had
put
the
ottoman
under
her
feet
she
who
had
put
near
her
the
inlaid
table
and
arranged
on
it
the
waiter
and
two
cups
i
expected
already
to
see
her
coming
in
carrying
the
evening
coffee
the
sweet
calm
girl
who
should
be
dressed
in
mourning
like
the
widow
and
resemble
her
very
much
absorbed
by
the
contemplation
of
a
scene
so
sympathetic
and
by
the
pleasure
of
imagining
that
humble
poem
i
remained
standing
some
steps
from
the
open
window
sure
of
not
being
noticed
in
the
dusky
street
when
i
saw
a
door
open
and
there
appeared
oh
how
far
he
was
from
my
thoughts
at
that
moment
my
friend
meurtrier
himself
the
formidable
hero
of
tilts
on
the
river
and
frays
in
unknown
places
a
sudden
doubt
crossed
me
i
felt
that
i
was
on
the
point
of
discovering
a
mystery
it
was
indeed
he
his
terrible
hairy
hand
held
a
tiny
silver
and
he
was
followed
by
a
poodle
which
greatly
embarrassed
his
steps
a
valiant
and
classic
poodle
the
poodle
of
blind
a
poor
beggar
poodle
a
poodle
clipped
like
a
lion
with
hairy
ruffles
on
his
four
paws
and
a
white
mustache
like
a
general
of
the
gymnase
mamma
said
the
giant
in
a
tone
of
ineffable
tenderness
here
is
your
coffee
i
am
sure
that
you
will
find
it
nice
the
water
was
boiling
well
and
i
poured
it
on
drop
by
drop
thank
you
said
the
old
lady
rolling
her
to
the
table
with
an
air
thank
you
my
little
achille
your
dear
father
said
many
a
time
that
there
was
not
my
equal
at
making
coffee
he
was
so
kind
and
indulgent
the
dear
good
man
but
i
begin
to
believe
that
you
are
even
better
than
i
at
that
moment
and
while
meurtrier
was
pouring
out
the
coffee
with
all
the
delicacy
of
a
young
girl
the
poodle
excited
no
doubt
by
the
uncovered
sugar
placed
his
forepaws
on
the
lap
of
his
mistress
down
médor
she
cried
with
a
benevolent
indignation
did
any
one
ever
see
such
a
troublesome
animal
look
here
sir
you
know
very
well
that
your
master
never
fails
to
give
you
the
last
of
his
cup
added
the
widow
addressing
her
son
you
have
taken
the
poor
fellow
out
have
you
not
illustration
certainly
mamma
he
replied
in
a
tone
that
was
almost
infantile
i
have
just
been
to
the
creamery
for
your
morning
milk
and
i
put
the
leash
and
collar
on
médor
and
took
him
with
me
and
he
has
attended
to
all
his
little
wants
do
be
disturbed
he
does
want
anything
reassured
on
this
point
important
to
canine
hygiene
the
good
dame
drank
her
coffee
between
her
son
and
her
dog
who
each
regarded
her
with
an
inexpressible
tenderness
it
was
assuredly
unnecessary
to
see
or
hear
more
i
had
already
descried
what
a
peaceful
family
life
upright
pure
and
devoted
my
friend
meurtrier
hid
under
his
chimerical
gasconades
but
the
spectacle
with
which
chance
had
favored
me
was
at
once
so
droll
and
so
touching
that
i
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
watch
for
some
moments
longer
that
indiscretion
sufficed
to
show
me
the
whole
truth
yes
this
type
of
roisterers
who
seemed
to
have
stepped
from
one
of
the
romances
of
paul
de
kock
this
athlete
this
despot
of
and
performed
simply
and
courageously
in
these
lowly
rooms
in
the
suburbs
the
sublime
duties
of
a
sister
of
charity
this
intrepid
oarsman
had
never
made
a
longer
voyage
than
to
conduct
his
mother
to
mass
or
vespers
every
sunday
this
billiard
expert
knew
only
how
to
play
bézique
this
trainer
of
was
the
submissive
slave
of
a
poodle
this
was
an
antigone
iii
the
next
morning
on
arriving
at
the
office
i
asked
meurtrier
how
he
had
employed
the
previous
evening
and
he
instantly
improvised
without
a
moment
hesitation
an
account
of
a
sharp
encounter
on
the
boulevard
at
two
in
the
morning
when
he
had
knocked
down
with
a
single
blow
of
his
fist
having
passed
his
thumb
through
the
ring
of
his
keys
a
terrible
street
rough
i
listened
smiling
ironically
and
thinking
to
confound
him
but
remembering
how
respectable
a
virtue
is
which
is
hidden
even
under
an
absurdity
i
struck
him
amicably
on
the
shoulder
and
said
with
conviction
meurtrier
you
are
a
hero
