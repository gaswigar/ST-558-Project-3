craig
kennedy
theories
it
has
always
seemed
strange
to
me
that
no
one
has
ever
endowed
a
professorship
in
criminal
science
in
any
of
our
large
craig
kennedy
laid
down
his
evening
paper
and
filled
his
pipe
with
my
tobacco
in
college
we
had
roomed
together
had
shared
everything
even
poverty
and
now
that
craig
was
a
professor
of
chemistry
and
i
was
on
the
staff
of
the
star
we
had
continued
the
arrangement
prosperity
found
us
in
a
rather
neat
bachelor
apartment
on
the
heights
not
far
from
the
university
why
should
there
be
a
chair
in
criminal
science
i
remarked
argumentatively
settling
back
in
my
chair
i
done
my
turn
at
police
headquarters
reporting
and
i
can
tell
you
craig
it
no
place
for
a
college
professor
crime
is
just
crime
and
as
for
dealing
with
it
the
good
detective
is
born
and
bred
to
it
college
professors
for
the
sociology
of
the
thing
yes
for
the
detection
of
it
give
me
a
on
the
contrary
replied
kennedy
his
features
betraying
an
earnestness
which
i
knew
indicated
that
he
was
leading
up
to
something
important
there
is
a
distinct
place
for
science
in
the
detection
of
crime
on
the
continent
they
are
far
in
advance
of
us
in
that
respect
we
are
mere
children
beside
a
dozen
in
paris
whom
i
could
yes
but
where
does
the
college
professor
come
in
i
asked
rather
doubtfully
you
must
remember
walter
he
pursued
warming
up
to
his
subject
that
it
only
within
the
last
ten
years
or
so
that
we
have
had
the
really
practical
college
professor
who
could
do
it
the
variety
is
out
of
date
now
it
is
the
college
professor
who
is
the
third
arbitrator
in
labour
disputes
who
reforms
our
currency
who
heads
our
tariff
commissions
and
conserves
our
farms
and
forests
we
have
professors
of
everything
why
not
professors
of
crime
still
as
i
shook
my
head
dubiously
he
hurried
on
to
clinch
his
point
colleges
have
gone
a
long
way
from
the
old
ideal
of
pure
culture
they
have
got
down
to
solving
the
hard
facts
of
life
pretty
nearly
all
except
one
they
still
treat
crime
in
the
old
way
study
its
statistics
and
pore
over
its
causes
and
the
theories
of
how
it
can
be
prevented
but
as
for
running
the
criminal
himself
down
scientifically
relentlessly
bah
we
have
made
an
inch
of
progress
since
the
hammer
and
tongs
method
of
your
doubtless
you
will
write
a
thesis
on
this
most
interesting
subject
i
suggested
and
let
it
go
at
no
i
am
serious
he
replied
determined
for
some
reason
or
other
to
make
a
convert
of
me
i
mean
exactly
what
i
say
i
am
going
to
apply
science
to
the
detection
of
crime
the
same
sort
of
methods
by
which
you
trace
out
the
presence
of
a
chemical
or
run
an
unknown
germ
to
earth
and
before
i
have
gone
far
i
am
going
to
enlist
walter
jameson
as
an
aide
i
think
i
shall
need
you
in
my
how
do
i
come
in
well
for
one
thing
you
will
get
a
scoop
a
beat
whatever
you
call
it
in
that
newspaper
jargon
of
i
smiled
in
a
skeptical
way
such
as
newspapermen
are
wont
to
affect
toward
a
thing
until
it
is
done
after
which
we
make
a
wild
scramble
to
exploit
it
nothing
more
on
the
subject
passed
between
us
for
several
days
i
the
silent
bullet
detectives
in
fiction
nearly
always
make
a
great
mistake
said
kennedy
one
evening
after
our
first
conversation
on
crime
and
science
they
almost
invariably
antagonize
the
regular
detective
force
now
in
real
life
that
impossible
it
yes
i
agreed
looking
up
from
reading
an
account
of
the
failure
of
a
large
wall
street
brokerage
house
kerr
parker
and
the
peculiar
suicide
of
kerr
parker
yes
it
impossible
just
as
it
is
impossible
for
the
regular
detectives
to
antagonize
the
newspapers
scotland
yard
found
that
out
in
the
crippen
my
idea
of
the
thing
jameson
continued
kennedy
is
that
the
professor
of
criminal
science
ought
to
work
with
not
against
the
regular
detectives
they
all
right
they
indispensable
of
course
half
the
secret
of
success
nowadays
is
organisation
the
professor
of
criminal
science
should
be
merely
what
the
professor
in
a
technical
school
often
is
a
sort
of
consulting
engineer
for
instance
i
believe
that
organisation
plus
science
would
go
far
toward
clearing
up
that
wall
street
case
i
see
you
are
i
expressed
some
doubt
as
to
whether
the
regular
police
were
enlightened
enough
to
take
that
view
of
it
some
of
them
are
he
replied
yesterday
the
chief
of
police
in
a
western
city
sent
a
man
east
to
see
me
about
the
price
murder
you
know
the
case
indeed
i
did
a
wealthy
banker
of
the
town
had
been
murdered
on
the
road
to
the
golf
club
no
one
knew
why
or
by
whom
every
clue
had
proved
fruitless
and
the
list
of
suspects
was
itself
so
long
and
so
impossible
as
to
seem
most
discouraging
he
sent
me
a
piece
of
a
torn
handkerchief
with
a
deep
on
it
pursued
kennedy
he
said
it
clearly
did
belong
to
the
murdered
man
that
it
indicated
that
the
murderer
had
himself
been
wounded
in
the
tussle
but
as
yet
it
had
proved
utterly
valueless
as
a
clue
would
i
see
what
i
could
make
of
it
after
his
man
had
told
me
the
story
i
had
a
feeling
that
the
murder
was
committed
by
either
a
sicilian
labourer
on
the
links
or
a
negro
waiter
at
the
club
well
to
make
a
short
story
shorter
i
decided
to
test
the
probably
you
did
know
it
but
the
carnegie
institution
has
just
published
a
minute
careful
and
dry
study
of
the
blood
of
human
beings
and
of
animals
in
fact
they
have
been
able
to
reclassify
the
whole
animal
kingdom
on
this
basis
and
have
made
some
most
surprising
additions
to
our
knowledge
of
evolution
now
i
do
propose
to
bore
you
with
the
details
of
the
tests
but
one
of
the
things
they
showed
was
that
the
blood
of
a
certain
branch
of
the
human
race
gives
a
reaction
much
like
the
blood
of
a
certain
group
of
monkeys
the
chimpanzees
while
the
blood
of
another
branch
gives
a
reaction
like
that
of
the
gorilla
of
course
there
lots
more
to
it
but
this
is
all
that
need
concern
us
now
i
tried
the
tests
the
blood
on
the
handkerchief
conformed
strictly
to
the
latter
test
now
the
gorilla
was
of
course
out
of
the
question
this
was
no
rue
morgue
murder
therefore
it
was
the
negro
but
i
interrupted
the
negro
offered
a
perfect
alibi
at
the
start
and
no
buts
walter
here
a
telegram
i
received
at
dinner
confronted
jackson
your
evidence
as
wired
confessed
well
craig
i
take
off
my
hat
to
you
i
exclaimed
next
you
be
solving
this
kerr
parker
case
for
i
would
take
a
hand
in
it
if
they
let
me
said
he
simply
that
night
without
saying
anything
i
sauntered
down
to
the
imposing
new
police
building
amid
the
squalor
of
center
street
they
were
very
busy
at
headquarters
but
having
once
had
that
assignment
for
the
star
i
had
no
trouble
in
getting
in
inspector
barney
of
the
central
office
carefully
shifted
a
cigar
from
corner
to
corner
of
his
mouth
as
i
poured
forth
my
suggestion
to
him
well
jameson
he
said
at
length
do
you
think
this
professor
fellow
is
the
goods
i
did
mince
matters
in
my
opinion
of
kennedy
i
told
him
of
the
price
case
and
showed
him
a
copy
of
the
telegram
that
settled
it
can
you
bring
him
down
here
he
asked
quickly
i
reached
for
the
telephone
found
craig
in
his
laboratory
finally
and
in
less
than
an
hour
he
was
in
the
office
this
is
a
most
bating
case
professor
kennedy
this
case
of
kerr
parker
said
the
inspector
launching
at
once
into
his
subject
here
is
a
broker
heavily
interested
in
mexican
rubber
it
looks
like
a
good
thing
plantations
right
in
the
same
territory
as
those
of
the
rubber
trust
now
in
addition
to
that
he
is
branching
out
into
coastwise
steamship
lines
another
man
associated
with
him
is
heavily
engaged
in
a
railway
scheme
from
the
united
states
down
into
mexico
altogether
the
steamships
and
railroads
are
tapping
rubber
oil
copper
and
i
know
what
other
regions
here
in
new
york
they
have
been
pyramiding
stocks
borrowing
money
from
two
trust
companies
which
they
control
it
a
lovely
scheme
you
read
about
it
i
suppose
also
you
read
that
it
comes
into
competition
with
a
certain
group
of
capitalists
whom
we
will
call
system
well
this
depression
in
the
market
comes
along
at
once
rumours
are
spread
about
the
weakness
of
the
trust
companies
runs
start
on
both
of
them
the
system
you
know
them
make
a
great
show
of
supporting
the
market
yet
the
runs
continue
god
knows
whether
they
will
spread
or
the
trust
companies
stand
up
under
it
after
what
happened
it
was
a
good
thing
the
market
was
closed
when
it
happened
kerr
parker
was
surrounded
by
a
group
of
people
who
were
in
his
schemes
with
him
they
are
holding
a
council
of
war
in
the
directors
room
suddenly
parker
rises
staggers
toward
the
window
falls
and
is
dead
before
a
doctor
can
get
to
him
every
effort
is
made
to
keep
the
thing
quiet
it
is
given
out
that
he
committed
suicide
the
papers
do
seem
to
accept
the
suicide
theory
however
neither
do
we
the
coroner
who
is
working
with
us
has
kept
his
mouth
shut
so
far
and
will
say
nothing
till
the
inquest
for
professor
kennedy
my
first
man
on
the
spot
found
that
kerr
parker
was
murdered
now
here
comes
the
amazing
part
of
the
story
the
doors
to
the
offices
on
both
sides
were
open
at
the
time
there
were
lots
of
people
in
each
office
there
was
the
usual
click
of
typewriters
and
the
buzz
of
the
ticker
and
the
hum
of
conversation
we
have
any
number
of
witnesses
of
the
whole
affair
but
as
far
as
any
of
them
knows
no
shot
was
fired
no
smoke
was
seen
no
noise
was
heard
nor
was
any
weapon
found
yet
here
on
my
desk
is
a
bullet
the
coroner
physician
probed
it
out
of
parker
neck
this
afternoon
and
turned
it
over
to
kennedy
reached
for
the
bullet
and
turned
it
thoughtfully
in
his
fingers
for
a
moment
one
side
of
it
had
apparently
struck
a
bone
in
the
neck
of
the
murdered
man
and
was
flattened
the
other
side
was
still
perfectly
smooth
with
his
inevitable
he
scrutinised
the
bullet
on
every
side
i
watched
his
face
anxiously
and
i
could
see
that
he
was
very
intent
and
very
excited
extraordinary
most
extraordinary
he
said
to
himself
as
he
turned
it
over
and
over
where
did
you
say
this
bullet
struck
in
the
fleshy
part
of
the
neck
quite
a
little
back
of
and
below
his
ear
and
just
above
his
collar
there
was
much
bleeding
i
think
it
must
have
struck
the
base
of
his
it
did
strike
his
collar
or
hair
no
replied
the
inspector
inspector
i
think
we
shall
be
able
to
put
our
hands
on
the
murderer
i
think
we
can
get
a
conviction
sir
on
the
evidence
that
i
shall
get
from
this
bullet
in
my
that
pretty
much
like
a
drawled
the
inspector
incredulously
shaking
his
head
perhaps
smiled
kennedy
but
there
will
still
be
plenty
of
work
for
the
police
to
do
too
i
only
got
a
clue
to
the
murderer
it
will
take
the
whole
organisation
to
follow
it
up
believe
me
now
inspector
can
you
spare
the
time
to
go
down
to
parker
office
and
take
me
over
the
ground
no
doubt
we
can
develop
something
else
sure
answered
and
within
five
minutes
we
were
hurrying
down
town
in
one
of
the
department
automobiles
we
found
the
office
under
guard
of
one
of
the
central
office
men
while
in
the
outside
office
parker
confidential
clerk
and
a
few
assistants
were
still
at
work
in
a
subdued
and
awed
manner
men
were
working
in
many
other
wall
street
offices
that
night
during
the
panic
but
in
none
was
there
more
reason
for
it
than
here
later
i
learned
that
it
was
the
quiet
tenacity
of
this
confidential
clerk
that
saved
even
as
much
of
parker
estate
as
was
saved
for
his
widow
little
enough
it
was
too
what
he
saved
for
the
clients
of
the
firm
no
one
will
ever
know
somehow
or
other
i
liked
john
downey
the
clerk
from
the
moment
i
was
introduced
to
him
he
seemed
to
me
at
least
to
be
the
typical
confidential
clerk
who
would
carry
a
secret
worth
millions
and
keep
it
the
officer
in
charge
touched
his
hat
to
the
inspector
and
downey
hastened
to
put
himself
at
our
service
it
was
plain
that
the
murder
had
completely
mystified
him
and
that
he
was
as
anxious
as
we
were
to
get
at
the
bottom
of
it
mr
downey
began
kennedy
i
understand
you
were
present
when
this
sad
event
took
yes
sir
sitting
right
here
at
the
directors
table
he
replied
taking
a
chair
like
now
can
you
recollect
just
how
parker
acted
when
he
was
shot
could
could
you
take
his
place
and
show
us
just
how
it
happened
yes
sir
said
downey
he
was
sitting
here
at
the
head
of
the
table
bruce
who
is
the
of
the
firm
had
been
sitting
here
at
his
right
i
was
at
the
left
the
inspector
has
a
list
of
all
the
others
present
that
door
to
the
right
was
open
and
parker
and
some
other
ladies
were
in
the
room
mrs
parker
broke
in
kennedy
yes
like
a
good
many
brokerage
firms
we
have
a
ladies
room
many
ladies
are
among
our
clients
we
make
a
point
of
catering
to
them
at
that
time
i
recollect
the
door
was
open
all
the
doors
were
open
it
was
not
a
secret
meeting
bruce
had
just
gone
into
the
department
i
think
to
ask
some
of
them
to
stand
by
the
firm
he
was
an
artist
at
smoothing
over
the
fears
of
customers
particularly
women
just
before
he
went
in
i
had
seen
the
ladies
go
in
a
group
toward
the
far
end
of
the
room
to
look
down
at
the
line
of
depositors
on
the
street
which
reached
around
the
corner
from
one
of
the
trust
companies
i
thought
i
was
making
a
note
of
an
order
to
send
into
the
outside
office
there
on
the
left
and
had
just
pushed
this
button
here
under
the
table
to
call
a
boy
to
carry
it
parker
had
just
received
a
letter
by
special
delivery
and
seemed
considerably
puzzled
over
it
no
i
do
know
what
it
was
about
of
a
sudden
i
saw
him
start
in
his
chair
rise
up
unsteadily
clap
his
hand
on
the
back
of
his
head
stagger
across
the
floor
like
this
and
fall
then
what
happened
why
i
rushed
to
pick
him
up
everything
was
confusion
i
recall
someone
behind
me
saying
boy
take
all
these
papers
off
the
table
and
carry
them
into
my
office
before
they
get
lost
in
the
excitement
i
think
it
was
bruce
voice
the
next
moment
i
heard
someone
say
back
parker
has
fainted
but
i
did
pay
much
attention
for
i
was
calling
to
someone
not
to
get
a
doctor
over
the
telephone
but
to
go
down
to
the
fifth
floor
where
one
has
an
office
i
made
parker
as
comfortable
as
i
could
there
was
much
i
could
do
he
seemed
to
want
to
say
something
to
me
but
he
talk
he
was
paralysed
at
least
his
throat
was
but
i
did
manage
to
make
out
finally
what
sounded
to
me
like
her
i
do
believe
the
scandal
i
do
believe
it
but
before
he
could
say
whom
to
tell
he
had
again
become
unconscious
and
by
the
time
the
doctor
arrived
he
was
dead
i
guess
you
know
everything
else
as
well
as
i
you
did
hear
the
shot
fired
from
any
particular
direction
asked
kennedy
no
well
where
do
you
think
it
came
from
that
what
puzzles
me
sir
the
only
thing
i
can
figure
out
is
that
it
was
fired
from
the
outside
office
perhaps
by
some
customer
who
had
lost
money
and
sought
revenge
but
no
one
out
there
heard
it
either
any
more
than
they
did
in
the
directors
room
or
the
ladies
about
that
message
asked
kennedy
ignoring
what
to
me
seemed
to
be
the
most
important
feature
of
the
case
the
mystery
of
the
silent
bullet
did
you
see
it
after
all
was
over
no
sir
in
fact
i
had
forgotten
about
it
till
this
moment
when
you
asked
me
to
reconstruct
the
circumstances
exactly
no
sir
i
know
a
thing
about
it
i
ca
say
it
impressed
itself
on
my
mind
at
the
time
what
did
parker
do
when
she
came
to
oh
she
cried
as
i
have
never
seen
a
woman
cry
before
he
was
dead
by
that
time
of
bruce
and
i
saw
her
down
in
the
elevator
to
her
car
in
fact
the
doctor
who
had
arrived
said
that
the
sooner
she
was
taken
home
the
better
she
would
be
she
was
quite
did
she
say
anything
that
you
remember
downey
hesitated
out
with
it
downey
said
the
inspector
what
did
she
say
as
she
was
going
down
in
the
elevator
tell
us
i
arrest
you
if
you
nothing
about
the
murder
on
my
honour
protested
downey
kennedy
leaned
over
suddenly
and
shot
a
remark
at
him
then
it
was
about
the
downey
was
surprised
but
not
quickly
enough
still
he
seemed
to
be
considering
something
and
in
a
moment
he
said
i
do
know
what
it
was
about
but
i
feel
it
is
my
duty
after
all
to
tell
you
i
heard
her
say
wonder
if
he
knew
nothing
else
nothing
what
happened
after
you
came
back
we
entered
the
ladies
department
no
one
was
there
a
was
thrown
over
a
chair
in
a
heap
bruce
picked
it
up
parker
he
said
he
wrapped
it
up
hastily
and
rang
for
a
where
did
he
send
it
to
parker
i
suppose
i
did
hear
the
we
next
went
over
the
whole
suite
of
offices
conducted
by
downey
i
noted
how
carefully
kennedy
looked
into
the
directors
room
through
the
open
door
from
the
ladies
department
he
stood
at
such
an
angle
that
had
he
been
the
assassin
he
could
scarcely
have
been
seen
except
by
those
sitting
immediately
next
parker
at
the
directors
table
the
street
windows
were
directly
in
front
of
him
and
back
of
him
was
the
chair
on
which
the
motorcoat
had
been
found
in
parker
own
office
we
spent
some
time
as
well
as
in
bruce
kennedy
made
a
search
for
the
note
but
finding
nothing
in
either
office
turned
out
the
contents
of
bruce
there
seem
to
be
anything
in
it
to
interest
him
however
even
after
he
had
pieced
several
torn
bits
of
scraps
together
with
much
difficulty
and
he
was
about
to
turn
the
papers
back
again
when
he
noticed
something
sticking
to
the
side
of
the
basket
it
looked
like
a
mass
of
wet
paper
and
that
was
precisely
what
it
was
that
queer
said
kennedy
picking
it
loose
then
he
wrapped
it
up
carefully
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
inspector
can
you
lend
me
one
of
your
men
for
a
couple
of
days
he
asked
as
we
were
preparing
to
leave
i
shall
want
to
send
him
out
of
town
and
shall
probably
need
his
services
when
he
gets
very
well
riley
will
be
just
the
fellow
we
go
back
to
headquarters
and
i
put
him
under
your
it
was
not
until
late
in
the
following
day
that
i
saw
kennedy
again
it
had
been
a
busy
day
at
the
star
we
had
gone
to
work
that
morning
expecting
to
see
the
very
financial
heavens
fall
but
just
about
five
minutes
to
ten
before
the
stock
exchange
opened
the
news
came
in
over
the
wire
from
our
financial
man
on
broad
street
system
has
forced
james
bruce
partner
of
kerr
parker
the
dead
banker
to
sell
his
railroad
steamship
and
rubber
holdings
to
it
on
this
condition
it
promises
unlimited
support
to
the
forced
muttered
the
managing
editor
as
he
waited
on
the
office
phone
to
get
the
so
as
to
hurry
up
the
few
lines
in
red
ink
on
the
first
page
and
beat
our
rivals
on
the
streets
with
the
first
extras
why
he
been
working
to
bring
that
about
for
the
past
two
weeks
what
that
system
does
control
is
worth
having
it
edits
the
news
before
our
men
get
it
and
as
for
grist
for
the
divorce
courts
and
tragedies
well
hello
jenkins
yes
a
special
extra
change
the
big
heads
copy
is
on
the
way
up
rush
so
you
think
this
parker
case
is
a
mess
i
asked
i
know
it
that
a
pretty
swift
bunch
of
females
that
have
been
speculating
at
kerr
parker
i
understand
there
one
young
lady
who
by
the
way
has
at
least
one
husband
who
has
yet
been
divorced
who
is
a
sort
of
ringleader
though
she
rarely
goes
personally
to
her
brokers
offices
she
one
of
those
uptown
plungers
and
the
story
is
that
she
has
a
whole
string
of
scalps
of
alleged
superintendents
at
her
belt
she
can
make
bruce
do
pretty
nearly
anything
they
say
he
the
latest
conquest
i
got
the
story
on
pretty
good
authority
but
until
i
verified
the
names
dates
and
places
of
course
i
would
dare
print
a
line
of
it
the
story
goes
that
her
husband
is
a
of
the
system
and
that
she
been
working
in
their
interest
too
that
was
why
he
was
so
complacent
over
the
whole
affair
they
put
her
up
to
capturing
bruce
and
after
she
had
acquired
an
influence
over
him
they
worked
it
so
that
she
made
him
make
love
to
parker
it
a
long
story
but
that
is
all
of
it
the
point
was
you
see
that
by
this
devious
route
they
hoped
to
worm
out
of
parker
some
inside
information
about
parker
rubber
schemes
which
he
had
divulged
even
to
his
partners
in
business
it
was
a
deep
and
carefully
planned
plot
and
some
of
the
conspirators
were
pretty
deeply
in
the
mire
i
guess
i
wish
i
had
all
the
facts
about
who
this
female
machiavelli
was
what
a
piece
of
muckraking
it
would
have
made
oh
here
comes
the
rest
of
the
news
story
over
the
wire
by
jove
it
is
said
on
good
authority
that
bruce
will
be
taken
in
as
one
of
the
board
of
directors
what
do
you
think
of
that
so
that
was
how
the
wind
lay
bruce
making
love
to
parker
and
she
presumably
betraying
her
husband
secrets
i
thought
i
saw
it
all
the
note
from
somebody
exposing
the
scheme
parker
incredulity
bruce
sitting
by
him
and
catching
sight
of
the
note
his
hurrying
out
into
the
ladies
department
and
then
the
shot
but
who
fired
it
after
all
i
had
only
picked
up
another
clue
kennedy
was
not
at
the
apartment
at
dinner
and
an
inquiry
at
the
laboratory
was
fruitless
also
so
i
sat
down
to
fidget
for
a
while
pretty
soon
the
buzzer
on
the
door
sounded
and
i
opened
it
to
find
a
with
a
large
brown
paper
parcel
is
bruce
here
he
asked
why
no
he
does
then
i
checked
myself
and
added
he
will
be
here
presently
you
can
leave
the
well
this
is
the
parcel
he
telephoned
for
his
valet
told
me
to
tell
him
that
they
had
a
hard
time
to
find
it
but
he
guesses
it
all
right
the
charges
are
forty
cents
sign
i
signed
the
book
feeling
like
a
thief
and
the
boy
departed
what
it
all
meant
i
could
not
guess
just
then
i
heard
a
key
in
the
lock
and
kennedy
came
in
is
your
name
bruce
i
asked
why
he
replied
eagerly
has
anything
come
i
pointed
to
the
package
kennedy
made
a
dive
for
it
and
unwrapped
it
it
was
a
woman
pongee
he
held
it
up
to
the
light
the
pocket
on
the
side
was
scorched
and
burned
and
a
hole
was
torn
clean
through
it
i
gasped
when
the
full
significance
of
it
dawned
on
me
how
did
you
get
it
i
exclaimed
at
last
in
surprise
that
where
organisation
comes
in
said
kennedy
the
police
at
my
request
went
over
every
messenger
call
from
parker
office
that
afternoon
and
traced
every
one
of
them
up
at
last
they
found
one
that
led
to
bruce
apartment
none
of
them
led
to
parker
home
the
rest
were
all
business
calls
and
satisfactorily
accounted
for
i
reasoned
that
this
was
the
one
that
involved
the
disappearance
of
the
it
was
a
chance
worth
taking
so
i
got
downey
to
call
up
bruce
valet
the
valet
of
course
recognised
downey
voice
and
suspected
nothing
downey
assumed
to
know
all
about
the
coat
in
the
package
received
yesterday
he
asked
to
have
it
sent
up
here
i
see
the
scheme
but
kennedy
do
you
think
she
i
stopped
speechless
looking
at
the
scorched
coat
nothing
to
say
yet
he
replied
laconically
but
if
you
could
tell
me
anything
about
that
note
parker
received
i
thank
i
related
what
our
managing
editor
had
said
that
morning
kennedy
only
raised
his
eyebrows
a
fraction
of
an
inch
i
had
guessed
something
of
that
sort
he
said
merely
i
glad
to
find
it
confirmed
even
by
hearsay
evidence
this
young
lady
interests
me
not
a
very
definite
description
but
better
than
nothing
at
all
i
wonder
who
she
is
ah
well
what
do
you
say
to
a
stroll
down
the
white
way
before
i
go
to
my
laboratory
i
like
a
breath
of
air
to
relax
my
we
had
got
no
further
than
the
first
theatre
when
kennedy
slapped
me
on
the
back
by
george
jameson
she
an
actress
of
who
is
what
the
matter
with
you
kennedy
are
you
crazy
the
person
she
must
be
an
actress
do
you
remember
the
leading
lady
in
the
the
girl
who
sings
that
song
about
mary
quite
contrary
her
stage
name
you
know
is
phoebe
la
neige
well
if
it
she
who
is
concerned
in
this
case
i
think
she
be
playing
let
inquire
at
the
she
was
playing
but
just
what
it
had
to
do
with
anything
in
particular
i
could
see
and
i
said
as
much
why
walter
you
never
do
as
a
detective
you
lack
intuition
sometimes
i
think
i
have
quite
enough
of
it
either
why
did
i
think
of
that
sooner
do
you
know
she
is
the
wife
of
adolphus
hesse
the
most
inveterate
gambler
in
stocks
in
the
system
why
i
had
only
to
put
two
and
two
together
and
the
whole
thing
flashed
on
me
in
an
instant
is
it
a
good
hypothesis
that
she
is
the
woman
in
the
case
the
tool
of
the
system
in
which
her
husband
is
so
heavily
involved
i
have
to
add
her
to
my
list
of
why
you
do
think
she
did
the
shooting
i
asked
half
hoping
i
must
admit
for
an
assenting
nod
from
him
well
he
answered
dryly
one
should
let
any
preconceived
hypothesis
stand
between
him
and
the
truth
i
made
a
guess
at
the
whole
thing
already
it
may
or
it
may
not
be
right
anyhow
she
will
fit
into
it
and
if
it
not
right
i
got
to
be
prepared
to
make
a
new
guess
that
when
we
reached
the
laboratory
on
our
return
the
inspector
man
riley
was
there
waiting
impatiently
for
kennedy
what
luck
asked
kennedy
i
got
a
list
of
purchasers
of
that
kind
of
revolver
he
said
we
have
been
to
every
and
in
the
city
which
bought
them
from
the
factory
and
i
could
lay
my
hands
on
pretty
nearly
every
one
of
those
weapons
in
hours
provided
of
course
they
have
been
secreted
or
pretty
nearly
all
is
good
enough
said
kennedy
it
will
have
to
be
all
unless
that
name
is
in
the
list
whispered
riley
hoarsely
oh
then
it
all
right
answered
kennedy
brightening
up
riley
i
will
say
that
you
a
wonder
at
using
the
organisation
in
ferreting
out
such
things
there
just
one
more
thing
i
want
you
to
do
i
want
a
sample
of
the
notepaper
in
the
private
desks
of
every
one
of
these
he
handed
the
policeman
a
list
of
his
suspects
as
he
called
them
it
included
nearly
every
one
mentioned
in
the
case
riley
studied
it
dubiously
and
scratched
his
chin
thoughtfully
a
hard
one
kennedy
sir
you
see
it
means
getting
into
so
many
different
houses
and
apartments
now
you
do
want
to
do
it
by
means
of
a
warrant
do
you
sir
of
course
not
well
then
how
can
we
get
in
you
a
pretty
chap
yourself
riley
said
kennedy
i
should
think
you
could
jolly
a
housemaid
if
necessary
anyhow
you
can
get
the
fellow
on
the
beat
to
do
it
if
he
is
already
to
be
found
in
the
kitchen
why
i
see
a
dozen
ways
of
getting
the
oh
it
me
that
the
sir
grinned
riley
i
a
regular
blarney
stone
when
i
out
on
a
job
of
that
sort
sure
i
have
some
of
them
for
you
in
the
bring
me
what
you
get
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
even
if
you
landed
only
a
few
samples
said
kennedy
as
riley
departed
straightening
his
tie
and
brushing
his
hat
on
his
sleeve
and
now
walter
you
too
must
excuse
me
said
craig
got
a
lot
to
do
and
be
up
to
our
apartment
till
very
late
or
early
but
i
feel
sure
i
got
a
on
this
mystery
if
i
get
those
papers
from
riley
in
good
time
i
shall
invite
you
and
several
others
to
a
grand
demonstration
here
night
forget
keep
the
whole
evening
free
it
will
be
a
big
kennedy
laboratory
was
brightly
lighted
when
i
arrived
early
the
next
evening
one
by
one
his
guests
dropped
in
it
was
evident
that
they
had
little
liking
for
the
visit
but
the
coroner
had
sent
out
the
invitations
and
they
had
nothing
to
do
but
accept
each
one
was
politely
welcomed
by
the
professor
and
assigned
a
seat
much
as
he
would
have
done
with
a
group
of
students
the
inspector
and
the
coroner
sat
back
a
little
parker
downey
bruce
myself
and
miss
la
neige
sat
in
that
order
in
the
very
narrow
and
uncomfortable
little
armchairs
used
by
the
students
during
lectures
at
last
kennedy
was
ready
to
begin
he
took
his
position
behind
the
long
table
which
he
used
for
his
demonstrations
before
his
classes
i
realise
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
began
formally
that
i
am
about
to
do
a
very
unusual
thing
but
as
you
all
know
the
police
and
the
coroner
have
been
completely
baffled
by
this
terrible
mystery
and
have
requested
me
to
attempt
to
clear
up
at
least
certain
points
in
it
i
will
begin
what
i
have
to
say
by
remarking
that
the
tracing
out
of
a
crime
like
this
differs
in
nothing
except
as
regards
the
from
the
search
for
a
scientific
truth
the
forcing
of
man
secrets
is
like
the
forcing
of
nature
secrets
both
are
pieces
of
detective
work
the
methods
employed
in
the
detection
of
crime
are
or
rather
should
be
like
the
methods
employed
in
the
process
of
discovering
scientific
truth
in
a
crime
of
this
sort
two
kinds
of
evidence
need
to
be
secured
circumstantial
evidence
must
first
be
marshalled
and
then
a
motive
must
be
found
i
have
been
gathering
facts
but
to
omit
motives
and
rest
contented
with
mere
facts
would
be
inconclusive
it
would
never
convince
anybody
or
convict
anybody
in
other
words
circumstantial
evidence
must
first
lead
to
a
suspect
and
then
this
suspect
must
prove
equal
to
accounting
for
the
facts
it
is
my
hope
that
each
of
you
may
contribute
something
that
will
be
of
service
in
arriving
at
the
truth
of
this
unfortunate
the
tension
was
not
relieved
even
when
kennedy
stopped
speaking
and
began
to
fuss
with
a
little
upright
target
which
he
set
up
at
one
end
of
his
table
we
seemed
to
be
seated
over
a
powder
magazine
which
threatened
to
explode
at
any
moment
i
at
least
felt
the
tension
so
greatly
that
it
was
only
after
he
had
started
speaking
again
that
i
noticed
that
the
target
was
composed
of
a
thick
layer
of
some
material
holding
a
pistol
in
his
right
hand
and
aiming
it
at
the
target
kennedy
picked
up
a
large
piece
of
coarse
homespun
from
the
table
and
held
it
loosely
over
the
muzzle
of
the
gun
then
he
fired
the
bullet
tore
through
the
cloth
sped
through
the
air
and
buried
itself
in
the
target
with
a
knife
he
pried
it
out
i
doubt
if
even
the
inspector
himself
could
have
told
us
that
when
an
ordinary
leaden
bullet
is
shot
through
a
woven
fabric
the
weave
of
that
fabric
is
in
the
majority
of
cases
impressed
on
the
bullet
sometimes
clearly
sometimes
here
kennedy
took
up
a
piece
of
fine
batiste
and
fired
another
bullet
through
it
every
leaden
bullet
as
i
have
said
which
has
struck
such
a
fabric
bears
an
impression
of
the
threads
which
is
recognisable
even
when
the
bullet
has
penetrated
deeply
into
the
body
it
is
only
obliterated
partially
or
entirely
when
the
bullet
has
been
flattened
by
striking
a
bone
or
other
hard
object
even
then
as
in
this
case
if
only
a
part
of
the
bullet
is
flattened
the
remainder
may
still
show
the
marks
of
the
fabric
a
heavy
warp
say
of
cotton
velvet
or
as
i
have
here
homespun
will
be
imprinted
well
on
the
bullet
but
even
a
fine
batiste
containing
one
hundred
threads
to
the
inch
will
show
marks
even
layers
of
goods
such
as
a
coat
shirt
and
undershirt
may
each
leave
their
marks
but
that
does
not
concern
us
in
this
case
now
i
have
here
a
piece
of
pongee
silk
cut
from
a
woman
i
discharge
the
bullet
through
it
so
i
compare
the
bullet
now
with
the
others
and
with
the
one
probed
from
the
neck
of
parker
i
find
that
the
marks
on
that
fatal
bullet
correspond
precisely
with
those
on
the
bullet
fired
through
the
pongee
startling
as
was
this
revelation
kennedy
paused
only
an
instant
before
the
next
now
i
have
another
demonstration
a
certain
note
figures
in
this
case
parker
was
reading
it
or
perhaps
it
at
the
time
he
was
shot
i
have
not
been
able
to
obtain
that
note
at
least
not
in
a
form
such
as
i
could
use
in
discovering
what
were
its
contents
but
in
a
certain
wastebasket
i
found
a
mass
of
wet
and
paper
it
had
been
cut
up
macerated
perhaps
chewed
perhaps
it
had
been
also
soaked
with
water
there
was
a
washbasin
with
running
water
in
this
room
the
ink
had
run
and
of
course
was
illegible
the
thing
was
so
unusual
that
i
at
once
assumed
that
this
was
the
remains
of
the
note
in
question
under
ordinary
circumstances
it
would
be
utterly
valueless
as
a
clue
to
anything
but
science
is
not
ready
to
let
anything
pass
as
valueless
i
found
on
microscopic
examination
that
it
was
an
uncommon
linen
bond
paper
and
i
have
taken
a
large
number
of
microphotographs
of
the
fibres
in
it
they
are
all
similar
i
have
here
also
about
a
hundred
microphotographs
of
the
fibres
in
other
kinds
of
paper
many
of
them
bonds
these
i
have
accumulated
from
time
to
time
in
my
study
of
the
subject
none
of
them
as
you
can
see
shows
fibres
resembling
this
one
in
question
so
we
may
conclude
that
it
is
of
uncommon
quality
through
an
agent
of
the
police
i
have
secured
samples
of
the
notepaper
of
every
one
who
could
be
concerned
as
far
as
i
could
see
with
this
case
here
are
the
photographs
of
the
fibres
of
these
various
notepapers
and
among
them
all
is
just
one
that
corresponds
to
the
fibres
in
the
wet
mass
of
paper
i
discovered
in
the
now
lest
anyone
should
question
the
accuracy
of
this
method
i
might
cite
a
case
where
a
man
had
been
arrested
in
germany
charged
with
stealing
a
government
bond
he
was
not
searched
till
later
there
was
no
evidence
save
that
after
the
arrest
a
large
number
of
spitballs
were
found
around
the
courtyard
under
his
cell
window
this
method
of
comparing
the
fibres
with
those
of
the
regular
government
paper
was
used
and
by
it
the
man
was
convicted
of
stealing
the
bond
i
think
it
is
almost
unnecessary
to
add
that
in
the
present
case
we
know
precisely
who
at
this
point
the
tension
was
so
great
that
it
snapped
miss
la
neige
who
was
sitting
beside
me
had
been
leaning
forward
involuntarily
almost
as
if
the
words
were
wrung
from
her
she
whispered
hoarsely
they
put
me
up
to
doing
it
i
did
want
to
but
the
affair
had
gone
too
far
i
could
see
him
lost
before
my
very
eyes
i
did
want
her
to
get
him
the
quickest
way
out
was
to
tell
the
whole
story
to
parker
and
stop
it
it
was
the
only
way
i
could
think
of
to
stop
this
thing
between
another
man
wife
and
the
man
i
loved
better
than
my
own
husband
god
knows
professor
kennedy
that
was
all
calm
yourself
madame
interrupted
kennedy
soothingly
calm
yourself
what
done
is
done
the
truth
must
come
out
be
calm
now
he
continued
after
the
first
storm
of
remorse
had
spent
itself
and
we
were
all
outwardly
composed
again
we
have
said
nothing
whatever
of
the
most
mysterious
feature
of
the
case
the
firing
of
the
shot
the
murderer
could
have
thrust
the
weapon
into
the
pocket
or
the
folds
of
this
coat
here
he
drew
forth
the
automobile
coat
and
held
it
aloft
displaying
the
bullet
hole
and
he
or
she
i
will
not
say
which
could
have
discharged
the
pistol
unseen
by
removing
and
secreting
the
weapon
afterward
one
very
important
piece
of
evidence
would
be
suppressed
this
person
could
have
used
such
a
cartridge
as
i
have
here
made
with
smokeless
powder
and
the
coat
would
have
concealed
the
flash
of
the
shot
very
effectively
there
would
have
been
no
smoke
but
neither
this
coat
nor
even
a
heavy
blanket
would
have
deadened
the
report
of
the
shot
what
are
we
to
think
of
that
only
one
thing
i
have
often
wondered
why
the
thing
was
done
before
in
fact
i
have
been
waiting
for
it
to
occur
there
is
an
invention
that
makes
it
almost
possible
to
strike
a
man
down
with
impunity
in
broad
daylight
in
any
place
where
there
is
sufficient
noise
to
cover
up
a
click
a
slight
and
the
whir
of
the
bullet
in
the
air
i
refer
to
this
little
device
of
a
hartford
inventor
i
place
it
over
the
muzzle
of
the
revolver
i
have
so
far
been
using
so
now
jameson
if
you
will
sit
at
that
typewriter
over
there
and
write
anything
so
long
as
you
keep
the
keys
clicking
the
inspector
will
start
that
imitation
in
the
corner
now
we
are
ready
i
cover
the
pistol
with
a
cloth
i
defy
anyone
in
this
room
to
tell
me
the
exact
moment
when
i
discharged
the
pistol
i
could
have
shot
any
of
you
and
an
outsider
not
in
the
secret
would
never
have
thought
that
i
was
the
culprit
to
a
certain
extent
i
have
reproduced
the
conditions
under
which
this
shooting
occurred
at
once
on
being
sure
of
this
feature
of
the
case
i
despatched
a
man
to
hartford
to
see
this
inventor
the
man
obtained
from
him
a
complete
list
of
all
the
dealers
in
new
york
to
whom
such
devices
had
been
sold
the
man
also
traced
every
sale
of
those
dealers
he
did
not
actually
obtain
the
weapon
but
if
he
is
working
on
according
to
agreement
he
is
at
this
moment
armed
with
a
and
is
ransacking
every
possible
place
where
the
person
suspected
of
this
crime
could
have
concealed
his
weapon
for
one
of
the
persons
intimately
connected
with
this
case
purchased
not
long
ago
a
silencer
for
a
revolver
and
i
presume
that
that
person
carried
the
gun
and
the
silencer
at
the
time
of
the
murder
of
kerr
kennedy
concluded
in
triumph
his
voice
high
pitched
his
eyes
flashing
yet
to
all
outward
appearance
not
a
was
quickened
someone
in
that
room
had
an
amazing
store
of
the
fear
flitted
across
my
mind
that
even
at
the
last
kennedy
was
baffled
i
had
anticipated
some
such
he
continued
after
a
moment
i
am
prepared
for
he
touched
a
bell
and
the
door
to
the
next
room
opened
one
of
kennedy
graduate
students
stepped
in
you
have
the
records
whiting
he
asked
yes
i
may
say
said
kennedy
that
each
of
your
chairs
is
wired
under
the
arm
in
such
a
way
as
to
betray
on
an
appropriate
indicator
in
the
next
room
every
sudden
and
undue
emotion
though
it
may
be
concealed
from
the
eye
even
of
one
like
me
who
stands
facing
you
such
emotion
is
nevertheless
expressed
by
physical
pressure
on
the
arms
of
the
chair
it
is
a
test
that
is
used
frequently
with
students
to
demonstrate
various
points
of
psychology
you
need
raise
your
arms
from
the
chairs
ladies
and
gentlemen
the
tests
are
all
over
now
what
did
they
show
whiting
the
student
read
what
he
had
been
noting
in
the
next
room
at
the
production
of
the
coat
during
the
demonstration
of
the
markings
of
the
bullet
parker
had
betrayed
great
emotion
bruce
had
done
likewise
and
nothing
more
than
ordinary
emotion
had
been
noted
for
the
rest
of
us
miss
la
neige
automatic
record
during
the
tracing
out
of
the
sending
of
the
note
to
parker
had
been
especially
unfavourable
to
her
bruce
showed
almost
as
much
excitement
parker
very
little
and
downey
very
little
it
was
all
set
forth
in
curves
drawn
by
pens
on
regular
ruled
paper
the
student
had
merely
noted
what
took
place
in
the
as
corresponding
to
these
curves
at
the
mention
of
the
noiseless
gun
said
kennedy
bending
over
the
record
while
the
student
pointed
it
out
to
him
and
we
leaned
forward
to
catch
his
words
i
find
that
the
curves
of
miss
la
neige
parker
and
downey
are
only
so
far
from
normal
as
would
be
natural
all
of
them
were
witnessing
a
thing
for
the
first
time
with
only
curiosity
and
no
fear
the
curve
made
by
bruce
shows
great
agitation
and
i
heard
a
metallic
click
at
my
side
and
turned
hastily
it
was
inspector
barney
who
had
stepped
out
of
the
shadow
with
a
pair
of
james
bruce
you
are
under
arrest
he
said
there
flashed
on
my
mind
and
i
think
on
the
minds
of
some
of
the
others
a
picture
of
another
electrically
wired
chair
ii
the
scientific
cracksman
i
willing
to
wager
you
a
box
of
cigars
that
you
do
know
the
most
fascinating
story
in
your
own
paper
remarked
kennedy
as
i
came
in
one
evening
with
the
four
or
five
newspapers
i
was
in
the
habit
of
reading
to
see
whether
they
had
beaten
the
star
in
getting
any
news
of
importance
i
bet
i
do
i
said
or
i
was
one
of
about
a
dozen
who
worked
it
up
it
the
shaw
murder
trial
there
is
another
that
even
a
bad
i
am
afraid
the
cigars
will
be
on
you
walter
crowded
over
on
the
second
page
by
a
lot
of
stale
sensation
that
everyone
has
read
for
the
fiftieth
time
now
you
will
find
what
promises
to
be
a
real
sensation
a
curious
account
of
the
sudden
death
of
john
i
laughed
craig
i
said
when
you
put
up
a
simple
death
from
apoplexy
against
a
murder
trial
and
such
a
murder
trial
well
you
disappoint
me
that
is
it
a
simple
case
of
apoplexy
he
asked
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
while
i
wondered
why
he
should
grow
excited
over
what
seemed
a
very
ordinary
news
item
after
all
then
he
picked
up
the
paper
and
read
the
account
slowly
aloud
john
fletcher
steel
magnate
dies
suddenly
safe
open
but
large
sum
of
cash
untouched
john
graham
fletcher
the
aged
philanthropist
and
steelmaker
was
found
dead
in
his
library
this
morning
at
his
home
at
fletcherwood
great
neck
long
island
strangely
the
safe
in
the
library
in
which
he
kept
his
papers
and
a
large
sum
of
cash
was
found
opened
but
as
far
as
could
be
learned
nothing
is
missing
it
had
always
been
fletcher
custom
to
rise
at
seven
this
morning
his
housekeeper
became
alarmed
when
he
had
not
appeared
by
nine
listening
at
the
door
she
heard
no
sound
it
was
not
locked
and
on
entering
she
found
the
former
lying
lifeless
on
the
floor
between
his
bedroom
and
the
library
adjoining
his
personal
physician
bryant
was
immediately
notified
close
examination
of
the
body
revealed
that
his
face
was
slightly
discoloured
and
the
cause
of
death
was
given
by
the
physician
as
apoplexy
he
had
evidently
been
dead
about
eight
or
nine
hours
when
discovered
fletcher
is
survived
by
a
nephew
john
fletcher
who
is
the
blake
professor
of
bacteriology
at
the
university
and
by
a
grandniece
miss
helen
bond
professor
fletcher
was
informed
of
the
sad
occurrence
shortly
after
leaving
a
class
this
morning
and
hurried
out
to
fletcherwood
he
would
make
no
statement
other
than
that
he
was
inexpressibly
shocked
miss
bond
who
has
for
several
years
resided
with
relatives
and
francis
greene
of
little
neck
is
prostrated
by
the
shock
walter
added
kennedy
as
he
laid
down
the
paper
and
without
any
more
sparring
came
directly
to
the
point
there
was
something
missing
from
that
i
had
no
need
to
express
the
interest
i
now
really
felt
and
kennedy
hastened
to
take
advantage
of
it
just
before
you
came
in
he
continued
jack
fletcher
called
me
up
from
great
neck
you
probably
do
know
it
but
it
has
been
privately
reported
in
the
inner
circle
of
the
university
that
old
fletcher
was
to
leave
the
bulk
of
his
fortune
to
found
a
great
school
of
preventive
medicine
and
that
the
only
proviso
was
that
his
nephew
should
be
dean
of
the
school
the
professor
told
me
over
the
wire
that
the
will
was
missing
from
the
safe
and
that
it
was
the
only
thing
missing
from
his
excitement
i
judge
that
there
is
more
to
the
story
than
he
cared
to
tell
over
the
he
said
his
car
was
on
the
way
to
the
city
and
he
asked
if
i
would
come
and
help
him
he
would
say
how
now
i
know
him
pretty
well
and
i
going
to
ask
you
to
come
along
walter
for
the
express
purpose
of
keeping
this
thing
out
of
the
newspapers
understand
until
we
get
to
the
bottom
of
a
few
minutes
later
the
telephone
rang
and
the
announced
that
the
car
was
waiting
we
hurried
down
to
it
the
chauffeur
lounged
down
carelessly
into
his
seat
and
we
were
off
across
the
city
and
river
and
out
on
the
road
to
great
neck
with
amazing
speed
already
i
began
to
feel
something
of
kennedy
zest
for
the
adventure
i
found
myself
half
a
dozen
times
on
the
point
of
hazarding
a
suspicion
only
to
relapse
again
into
silence
at
the
inscrutable
look
on
face
what
was
the
mystery
that
awaited
us
in
the
great
lonely
house
on
long
island
we
found
fletcherwood
a
splendid
estate
directly
on
the
bay
with
a
long
driveway
leading
up
to
the
door
professor
fletcher
met
us
at
the
porte
cochere
and
i
was
glad
to
note
that
far
from
taking
me
as
an
intruder
he
seemed
rather
relieved
that
someone
who
understood
the
ways
of
the
newspapers
could
stand
between
him
and
any
reporters
who
might
possibly
drop
in
he
ushered
us
directly
into
the
library
and
closed
the
door
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
scarcely
wait
to
tell
his
story
kennedy
he
began
almost
trembling
with
excitement
look
at
that
safe
we
looked
it
had
been
drilled
through
in
such
a
way
as
to
break
the
combination
it
was
a
heavy
door
closely
fitting
and
it
was
the
best
kind
of
small
safe
that
the
state
of
the
art
had
produced
yet
clearly
it
had
been
tampered
with
and
successfully
who
was
this
scientific
cracksman
who
had
apparently
accomplished
the
impossible
it
was
no
ordinary
hand
and
brain
which
had
executed
this
fletcher
swung
the
door
wide
and
pointed
to
a
little
compartment
inside
whose
steel
door
had
been
jimmied
open
then
out
of
it
he
carefully
lifted
a
steel
box
and
deposited
it
on
the
library
table
i
suppose
everybody
has
been
handling
that
box
asked
craig
quickly
a
smile
flitted
across
fletcher
features
i
thought
of
that
kennedy
he
said
i
remembered
what
you
once
told
me
about
only
myself
has
touched
it
and
i
was
careful
to
take
hold
of
it
only
on
the
sides
the
will
was
placed
in
this
box
and
the
key
to
the
box
was
usually
in
the
lock
well
the
will
is
gone
all
nothing
else
was
touched
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
ca
find
a
mark
on
the
box
not
a
now
on
a
hot
and
humid
summer
night
like
last
night
i
should
say
it
was
pretty
likely
that
anyone
touching
this
metal
box
would
have
left
should
you
think
so
kennedy
kennedy
nodded
and
continued
to
examine
the
place
where
the
compartment
had
been
jimmied
a
low
whistle
aroused
us
coming
over
to
the
table
craig
tore
a
white
sheet
of
paper
off
a
pad
lying
there
and
deposited
a
couple
of
small
particles
on
it
i
found
them
sticking
on
the
jagged
edges
of
the
steel
where
it
had
been
forced
he
said
then
he
whipped
out
a
pocket
not
from
a
rubber
glove
he
commented
half
to
himself
by
jove
one
side
of
them
shows
lines
that
look
as
if
they
were
the
lines
on
a
person
fingers
and
the
other
side
is
perfectly
smooth
there
not
a
chance
of
using
them
as
a
clue
except
well
i
did
know
criminals
in
america
knew
that
what
stunt
why
you
know
how
keen
the
new
detectives
are
on
the
system
well
the
first
thing
some
of
the
criminals
in
europe
did
was
to
wear
rubber
gloves
so
that
they
would
leave
no
prints
but
you
ca
work
very
well
with
rubber
gloves
last
fall
in
paris
i
heard
of
a
fellow
who
had
given
the
police
a
lot
of
trouble
he
never
left
a
mark
or
at
least
it
was
no
good
if
he
did
he
painted
his
hands
lightly
with
a
liquid
rubber
which
he
had
invented
himself
it
did
all
that
rubber
gloves
would
do
and
yet
left
him
the
free
use
of
his
fingers
with
practically
the
same
keenness
of
touch
fletcher
whatever
is
at
the
bottom
of
this
affair
i
feel
sure
right
now
that
you
have
to
deal
with
no
ordinary
do
you
suppose
there
are
any
relatives
besides
those
we
know
of
i
asked
kennedy
when
fletcher
had
left
to
summon
the
servants
no
he
replied
i
think
not
fletcher
and
helen
bond
his
second
cousin
to
whom
he
is
engaged
are
the
only
kennedy
continued
to
study
the
library
he
walked
in
and
out
of
the
doors
and
examined
the
windows
and
viewed
the
safe
from
all
angles
the
old
gentleman
bedroom
is
here
he
said
indicating
a
door
now
a
good
smart
noise
or
perhaps
even
a
light
shining
through
the
transom
from
the
library
might
arouse
him
suppose
he
woke
up
suddenly
and
entered
by
this
door
he
would
see
the
thief
at
work
on
the
safe
yes
that
part
of
reconstructing
the
story
is
simple
but
who
was
the
intruder
just
then
fletcher
returned
with
the
servants
the
questioning
was
long
and
tedious
and
developed
nothing
except
that
the
butler
admitted
that
he
was
uncertain
whether
the
windows
in
the
library
were
locked
the
gardener
was
very
obtuse
but
finally
contributed
one
possibly
important
fact
he
had
noted
in
the
morning
that
the
back
gate
leading
into
a
disused
road
closer
to
the
bay
than
the
main
highway
in
front
of
the
house
was
open
it
was
rarely
used
and
was
kept
closed
only
by
an
ordinary
hook
whoever
had
opened
it
had
evidently
forgotten
to
hook
it
he
had
thought
it
strange
that
it
was
unhooked
and
in
closing
it
he
had
noticed
in
the
mud
of
the
roadway
marks
that
seemed
to
indicate
that
an
automobile
had
stood
there
after
the
servants
had
gone
fletcher
asked
us
to
excuse
him
for
a
while
as
he
wished
to
run
over
to
the
greenes
who
lived
across
the
bay
miss
bond
was
completely
prostrated
by
the
death
of
her
uncle
he
said
and
was
in
an
extremely
nervous
condition
meanwhile
if
we
found
any
need
of
a
machine
we
might
use
his
uncle
or
in
fact
anything
around
the
place
walter
said
craig
when
fletcher
had
gone
i
want
to
run
back
to
town
and
i
have
something
i
like
to
have
you
do
we
were
soon
speeding
back
along
the
splendid
road
to
long
island
city
while
he
laid
out
our
programme
you
go
down
to
the
star
office
he
said
and
look
through
all
the
clippings
on
the
whole
fletcher
family
get
a
complete
story
of
the
life
of
helen
bond
too
what
she
has
done
in
society
with
whom
she
has
been
seen
mostly
whether
she
has
made
any
trips
abroad
and
whether
she
has
ever
been
engaged
you
know
anything
likely
to
be
significant
going
up
to
the
apartment
to
get
my
camera
and
then
to
the
laboratory
to
get
some
rather
bulky
paraphernalia
i
want
to
take
out
to
fletcherwood
meet
me
at
the
columbus
circle
station
at
say
so
we
separated
my
search
revealed
the
fact
that
miss
bond
had
always
been
intimate
with
the
set
had
spent
last
summer
in
europe
a
good
part
of
the
time
in
switzerland
and
paris
with
the
greenes
as
far
as
i
could
find
out
she
had
never
been
reported
engaged
but
plenty
of
fortunes
as
well
as
foreign
titles
had
been
flitting
about
the
ward
of
the
craig
and
i
met
at
the
appointed
time
he
had
a
lot
of
paraphernalia
with
him
and
it
did
not
add
to
our
comfort
as
we
sped
back
but
it
was
much
over
half
an
hour
before
we
again
found
ourselves
nearing
great
neck
instead
of
going
directly
back
to
fletcherwood
however
craig
had
told
the
chauffeur
to
stop
at
the
plant
of
the
local
electric
light
and
power
company
where
he
asked
if
he
might
see
the
record
of
the
amount
of
current
used
the
night
before
the
curve
sprawled
across
the
ruled
surface
of
the
sheet
by
the
automatic
was
irregular
showing
the
ups
and
downs
of
the
current
rising
sharply
from
sundown
and
gradually
declining
after
nine
as
the
lights
went
out
somewhere
between
eleven
and
twelve
however
the
irregular
fall
of
the
curve
was
broken
by
a
quite
noticeable
upward
twist
craig
asked
the
men
if
that
usually
happened
they
were
quite
sure
that
the
curve
as
a
rule
went
gradually
down
until
twelve
when
the
power
was
shut
off
but
they
did
not
see
anything
remarkable
in
it
oh
i
suppose
some
of
the
big
houses
had
guests
volunteered
the
foreman
and
just
to
show
off
the
place
perhaps
they
turned
on
all
the
lights
i
do
know
sir
what
it
was
but
it
could
have
been
a
heavy
drain
or
we
would
have
noticed
it
at
the
time
and
the
lights
would
all
have
been
well
said
craig
just
watch
and
see
if
it
occurs
again
about
the
same
all
right
and
when
you
close
down
the
plant
for
the
night
will
you
bring
the
record
card
up
to
fletcherwood
asked
craig
slipping
a
bill
into
the
pocket
of
the
foreman
shirt
i
will
and
thank
you
it
was
nearly
eleven
when
craig
had
got
his
apparatus
set
up
in
the
library
at
fletcherwood
then
he
unscrewed
all
the
bulbs
from
the
chandelier
in
the
library
and
attached
in
their
places
connections
with
the
usual
green
flexible
wire
rope
these
were
then
joined
up
to
a
little
instrument
which
to
me
looked
like
a
drill
next
he
muffed
the
drill
with
a
wad
of
felt
and
applied
it
to
the
safe
door
i
could
hear
the
dull
of
the
drill
going
into
the
bedroom
and
closing
the
door
i
found
that
it
was
still
audible
to
me
but
an
old
man
inclined
to
deafness
and
asleep
would
scarcely
have
been
awakened
by
it
in
about
ten
minutes
craig
displayed
a
neat
little
hole
in
the
safe
door
opposite
the
one
made
by
the
cracksman
in
the
combination
i
glad
you
honest
i
said
or
else
we
might
be
afraid
of
you
perhaps
even
make
you
prove
an
alibi
for
last
night
job
he
ignored
my
bantering
and
said
in
a
tone
such
as
he
might
have
used
before
a
class
of
students
in
the
gentle
art
of
scientific
now
if
the
power
company
curve
is
just
the
same
as
last
night
that
will
show
how
the
thing
was
done
i
wanted
to
be
sure
of
it
so
i
thought
i
try
this
apparatus
which
i
smuggled
in
from
paris
last
year
i
believe
the
old
man
happened
to
be
wakeful
and
heard
then
he
pried
off
the
door
of
the
interior
compartment
which
had
been
jimmied
open
perhaps
we
may
learn
something
by
looking
at
this
door
and
studying
the
marks
left
by
the
jimmy
by
means
of
this
new
instrument
of
mine
he
said
on
the
library
table
he
fastened
an
arrangement
with
two
upright
posts
supporting
a
dial
which
he
called
a
the
uprights
were
braced
in
the
back
and
the
whole
thing
reminded
me
of
a
miniature
guillotine
this
is
my
mechanical
detective
said
craig
proudly
it
was
devised
by
bertillon
himself
and
he
personally
gave
me
permission
to
copy
his
own
machine
you
see
it
is
devised
to
measure
pressure
now
let
take
an
ordinary
jimmy
and
see
just
how
much
pressure
it
takes
to
duplicate
those
marks
on
this
craig
laid
the
piece
of
steel
on
the
dynamometer
in
the
position
it
had
occupied
in
the
safe
and
braced
it
tightly
then
he
took
a
jimmy
and
pressed
on
it
with
all
his
strength
the
steel
door
was
connected
with
the
indicator
and
the
needle
spun
around
until
it
indicated
a
pressure
such
as
only
a
strong
man
could
have
exerted
comparing
the
marks
made
in
the
steel
in
the
experiment
and
by
the
it
was
evident
that
no
such
pressure
had
been
necessary
apparently
the
lock
on
the
door
was
only
a
trifling
affair
and
the
steel
itself
was
not
very
tough
the
had
relied
on
the
first
line
of
defence
to
repel
attack
craig
tried
again
and
again
each
time
using
less
force
at
last
he
got
a
mark
just
about
similar
to
the
original
marks
on
the
steel
well
well
what
do
you
think
of
that
he
exclaimed
reflectively
a
child
could
have
done
that
part
of
the
just
then
the
lights
went
off
for
the
night
craig
lighted
the
and
sat
in
silence
until
the
electric
light
plant
foreman
appeared
with
the
which
showed
a
curve
practically
identical
with
that
of
the
night
before
a
few
moments
later
professor
fletcher
machine
came
up
the
driveway
and
he
joined
us
with
a
worried
and
preoccupied
look
on
his
face
that
he
could
not
conceal
she
terribly
broken
up
by
the
suddenness
of
it
all
he
murmured
as
he
sank
into
an
armchair
the
shock
has
been
too
much
for
her
in
fact
i
had
the
heart
to
tell
her
anything
about
the
robbery
poor
then
in
a
moment
he
asked
any
more
clues
yet
kennedy
well
nothing
of
first
importance
i
have
only
been
trying
to
reconstruct
the
story
of
the
robbery
so
that
i
can
reason
out
a
motive
and
a
few
details
then
when
the
real
clues
come
along
we
wo
have
so
much
ground
to
cover
the
cracksman
was
certainly
clever
he
used
an
electric
drill
to
break
the
combination
and
ran
it
by
the
electric
light
whew
exclaimed
the
professor
is
that
so
he
must
have
been
above
the
average
that
by
the
way
fletcher
said
kennedy
i
wish
you
would
introduce
me
to
your
fiancee
i
would
like
to
know
gladly
fletcher
replied
only
you
must
be
careful
what
you
talk
about
remember
the
death
of
uncle
has
been
quite
a
shock
to
her
he
was
her
only
relative
besides
i
will
promised
kennedy
and
by
the
way
she
may
think
it
strange
that
i
out
here
at
a
time
like
this
perhaps
you
had
better
tell
her
i
a
nerve
specialist
or
something
of
that
sort
anything
not
to
connect
me
with
the
robbery
which
you
say
you
have
told
her
the
next
morning
found
kennedy
out
bright
and
early
for
he
had
not
had
a
very
good
chance
to
do
anything
during
the
night
except
reconstruct
the
details
he
was
now
down
by
the
back
gate
with
his
camera
where
i
found
him
turning
it
and
photographing
the
road
together
we
made
a
thorough
search
of
the
woods
and
the
road
about
the
gate
but
could
discover
absolutely
nothing
after
breakfast
i
improvised
a
dark
room
and
developed
the
films
while
craig
went
down
the
back
lane
along
the
shore
looking
for
clues
as
he
said
briefly
toward
noon
he
returned
and
i
could
see
that
he
was
in
a
brown
study
so
i
said
nothing
but
handed
him
the
photographs
of
the
road
he
took
them
and
laid
them
down
in
a
long
line
on
the
library
floor
they
seemed
to
consist
of
little
ridges
of
dirt
on
either
side
of
a
series
of
regular
round
spots
some
of
the
spots
very
clear
and
distinct
on
the
sides
others
quite
obscure
in
the
centre
now
and
then
where
you
would
expect
to
see
one
of
the
spots
just
for
the
symmetry
of
the
thing
it
was
missing
as
i
looked
at
the
line
of
photographs
on
the
floor
i
saw
that
they
were
a
photograph
of
the
track
made
by
the
tire
of
an
automobile
and
i
suddenly
recalled
what
the
gardener
had
said
next
craig
produced
the
results
of
his
morning
work
which
consisted
of
several
dozen
sheets
of
white
paper
carefully
separated
into
three
bundles
these
he
also
laid
down
in
long
lines
on
the
floor
each
package
in
a
separate
line
then
i
began
to
realise
what
he
was
doing
and
became
fascinated
in
watching
him
on
his
hands
and
knees
eagerly
scanning
the
papers
and
comparing
them
with
the
photographs
at
last
he
gathered
up
two
of
the
sets
of
papers
very
decisively
and
threw
them
away
then
he
shifted
the
third
set
a
bit
and
laid
it
closely
parallel
to
the
photographs
look
at
these
walter
he
said
now
take
this
deep
and
sharp
indentation
well
there
a
corresponding
one
in
the
photograph
so
you
can
pick
them
out
one
for
another
now
here
one
missing
altogether
on
the
paper
so
it
is
in
the
almost
like
a
schoolboy
in
his
glee
he
was
comparing
the
little
round
circles
made
by
the
metal
insertions
in
an
automobile
tire
time
and
again
i
had
seen
imprints
like
that
left
in
the
dust
and
grease
of
an
asphalted
street
or
the
mud
of
a
road
it
had
never
occurred
to
me
that
they
might
be
used
in
any
way
yet
here
craig
was
calmly
tracing
out
the
similarity
before
my
very
eyes
identifying
the
marks
made
in
the
photograph
with
the
prints
left
on
the
bits
of
paper
as
i
followed
him
i
had
a
most
curious
feeling
of
admiration
for
his
genius
craig
i
cried
that
the
of
an
there
speaks
the
yellow
journalist
he
answered
merrily
print
system
applied
to
motor
cars
i
can
see
the
sunday
feature
story
you
have
in
your
mind
with
that
headline
already
yes
walter
precisely
what
this
is
the
berlin
police
have
used
it
a
number
of
times
with
the
most
startling
but
craig
i
exclaimed
suddenly
the
paper
prints
where
did
you
get
them
what
machine
is
it
it
one
not
very
far
from
here
he
answered
sententiously
and
i
saw
he
would
say
nothing
more
that
might
fix
a
false
suspicion
on
anyone
still
my
curiosity
was
so
great
that
if
there
had
been
an
opportunity
i
certainly
should
have
tried
out
his
plan
on
all
the
cars
in
the
fletcher
garage
kennedy
would
say
nothing
more
and
we
ate
our
luncheon
in
silence
fletcher
who
had
decided
to
lunch
with
the
greenes
called
kennedy
up
on
the
telephone
to
tell
him
it
would
be
all
right
for
him
to
call
on
miss
bond
later
in
the
afternoon
and
i
may
bring
over
the
apparatus
i
once
described
to
you
to
determine
just
what
her
nervous
condition
is
he
asked
apparently
the
answer
was
yes
for
kennedy
hung
up
the
receiver
with
a
satisfied
walter
i
want
you
to
come
along
with
me
this
afternoon
as
my
assistant
remember
i
now
kennedy
the
nerve
specialist
and
you
are
jameson
my
colleague
and
we
are
to
be
in
consultation
on
a
most
important
do
you
think
that
fair
i
asked
hotly
to
take
that
girl
off
her
guard
to
insinuate
yourself
into
her
confidence
as
a
medical
adviser
and
worm
out
of
her
some
kind
of
fact
incriminating
someone
i
suppose
that
your
plan
and
i
do
like
the
ethics
or
rather
the
lack
of
ethics
of
the
now
think
a
minute
walter
perhaps
i
am
wrong
i
do
know
certainly
i
feel
that
the
end
will
justify
the
means
i
have
an
idea
that
i
can
get
from
miss
bond
the
only
clue
that
i
need
one
that
will
lead
straight
to
the
criminal
who
knows
i
have
a
suspicion
that
the
thing
i
going
to
do
is
the
highest
form
of
your
ethics
if
what
fletcher
tells
us
is
true
that
girl
is
going
insane
over
this
thing
why
should
she
be
so
shocked
over
the
death
of
an
uncle
she
did
not
live
with
i
tell
you
she
knows
something
about
this
case
that
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
know
too
if
she
does
tell
someone
it
will
eat
her
mind
out
i
add
a
dinner
to
the
box
of
cigars
we
have
already
bet
on
this
case
that
what
i
going
to
do
is
for
the
best
for
her
again
i
yielded
for
i
was
coming
to
have
more
and
more
faith
in
the
old
kennedy
i
had
seen
made
over
into
a
detective
and
together
we
started
for
the
greenes
craig
carrying
something
in
one
of
those
long
black
handbags
which
physicians
use
fletcher
met
us
on
the
driveway
he
seemed
to
be
very
much
affected
for
his
face
was
drawn
and
he
shifted
from
one
position
to
another
nervously
from
which
we
inferred
that
miss
bond
was
feeling
worse
it
was
late
afternoon
almost
verging
on
twilight
as
he
led
us
through
the
and
thence
onto
a
long
porch
overlooking
the
bay
and
redolent
with
honeysuckle
miss
bond
was
half
reclining
in
a
wicker
chair
us
we
entered
she
started
to
rise
to
greet
us
but
fletcher
gently
restrained
her
saying
as
he
introduced
us
that
he
guessed
the
doctors
would
pardon
any
informality
from
an
invalid
fletcher
was
a
pretty
fine
fellow
and
i
had
come
to
like
him
but
i
soon
found
myself
wondering
what
he
had
ever
done
to
deserve
winning
such
a
girl
as
helen
bond
she
was
what
i
should
describe
as
the
ideal
type
of
new
woman
tall
and
athletic
yet
without
any
affectation
of
mannishness
the
very
first
thought
that
struck
me
was
the
incongruousness
of
a
girl
of
her
type
suffering
from
an
attack
of
nerves
and
i
felt
sure
it
must
be
as
craig
had
said
that
she
was
concealing
a
secret
that
was
having
a
terrible
effect
on
her
a
casual
glance
might
not
have
betrayed
the
true
state
of
her
feelings
for
her
dark
hair
and
large
brown
eyes
and
the
tan
of
many
suns
on
her
face
and
arms
betokened
anything
but
the
neurasthenic
one
felt
instinctively
that
she
was
with
all
her
athletic
grace
primarily
a
womanly
woman
the
sun
sinking
toward
the
hills
across
the
bay
softened
the
brown
of
her
skin
and
as
i
observed
by
watching
her
closely
served
partially
to
conceal
the
nervousness
which
was
wholly
unnatural
in
a
girl
of
such
poise
when
she
smiled
there
was
a
false
note
in
it
it
was
forced
and
it
was
sufficiently
evident
to
me
that
she
was
going
through
a
mental
hell
of
conflicting
emotions
that
would
have
killed
a
woman
of
less
i
felt
that
i
would
like
to
be
in
fletcher
shoes
doubly
so
when
at
kennedy
request
he
withdrew
leaving
me
to
witness
the
torture
of
a
woman
of
such
fine
sensibilities
already
hunted
remorselessly
by
her
own
thoughts
still
i
will
give
kennedy
credit
for
a
tactfulness
that
i
did
know
the
old
fellow
possessed
he
carried
through
the
preliminary
questions
very
well
for
a
appealing
to
me
as
his
assistant
on
inconsequential
things
that
enabled
me
to
save
my
face
perfectly
when
he
came
to
the
critical
moment
of
opening
the
black
bag
he
made
a
very
appropriate
and
easy
remark
about
not
having
brought
any
sharp
shiny
instruments
or
nasty
black
drugs
all
i
wish
to
do
miss
bond
is
to
make
a
few
simple
little
tests
of
your
nervous
condition
one
of
them
we
specialists
call
reaction
time
and
another
is
a
test
of
heart
action
neither
is
of
any
seriousness
at
all
so
i
beg
of
you
not
to
become
excited
for
the
chief
value
consists
in
having
the
patient
perfectly
quiet
and
normal
after
they
are
over
i
think
i
know
whether
to
prescribe
absolute
rest
or
a
visit
to
she
smiled
languidly
as
he
adjusted
a
long
tightly
fitting
rubber
glove
on
her
shapely
forearm
and
then
encased
it
in
a
larger
absolutely
inflexible
covering
of
leather
between
the
rubber
glove
and
the
leather
covering
was
a
liquid
communicating
by
a
glass
tube
with
a
sort
of
dial
craig
had
often
explained
to
me
how
the
pressure
of
the
blood
was
registered
most
minutely
on
the
dial
showing
the
varied
emotions
as
keenly
as
if
you
had
taken
a
peep
into
the
very
mind
of
the
subject
i
think
the
experimental
psychologists
called
the
thing
a
then
he
had
an
apparatus
which
measured
association
time
the
essential
part
of
this
instrument
was
the
operation
of
a
very
delicate
and
this
duty
was
given
to
me
it
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
measuring
the
time
that
elapsed
between
his
questions
to
her
and
her
answers
while
he
recorded
the
actual
questions
and
answers
and
noted
the
results
which
i
worked
out
neither
of
us
was
unfamiliar
with
the
process
for
when
we
were
in
college
these
instruments
were
just
coming
into
use
in
america
kennedy
had
never
let
his
particular
branch
of
science
narrow
him
but
had
made
a
practice
of
keeping
abreast
of
all
the
important
discoveries
and
methods
in
other
fields
besides
i
had
read
articles
about
the
chronoscope
the
plethysmograph
the
sphygmograph
and
others
of
the
new
psychological
instruments
craig
carried
it
off
however
as
if
he
did
that
sort
of
thing
as
an
employment
now
miss
bond
he
said
and
his
voice
was
so
reassuring
and
persuasive
that
i
could
see
she
was
not
made
even
a
shade
more
nervous
by
our
simple
preparations
the
game
it
is
just
like
a
parlour
game
is
just
this
i
will
say
a
word
take
for
instance
you
are
to
answer
back
immediately
the
first
word
that
comes
into
your
mind
suggested
by
it
say
i
will
say
for
example
and
probably
you
will
answer
and
so
on
do
you
catch
my
meaning
it
may
seem
ridiculous
no
doubt
but
before
we
are
through
i
feel
sure
you
see
how
valuable
such
a
test
is
particularly
in
a
simple
case
of
nervousness
such
as
i
do
think
she
found
any
sinister
interpretation
in
his
words
but
i
did
and
if
ever
i
wanted
to
protest
it
was
then
but
my
voice
seemed
to
stick
in
my
throat
he
was
beginning
it
was
clearly
up
to
me
to
give
in
and
not
interfere
as
closely
as
i
was
able
i
kept
my
eyes
riveted
on
the
watch
and
other
apparatus
while
my
ears
and
heart
followed
with
mingled
emotions
the
low
musical
voice
of
the
girl
i
will
not
give
all
the
test
for
there
was
much
of
it
particularly
at
the
start
that
was
in
reality
valueless
since
it
was
merely
leading
up
to
the
surprise
from
the
colourless
questions
kennedy
suddenly
changed
it
was
done
in
an
instant
when
miss
bond
had
been
completely
disarmed
and
put
off
her
guard
night
said
kennedy
day
came
back
the
reply
from
miss
bond
did
i
detect
or
imagine
a
faint
hesitation
yes
it
was
plain
that
time
but
the
words
followed
one
another
in
quick
succession
there
was
no
rest
she
had
no
chance
to
collect
herself
i
noted
the
marked
difference
in
the
reaction
time
and
in
my
sympathy
damned
this
cold
scientific
third
degree
quartier
craig
gave
it
its
gallicised
pronunciation
really
kennedy
she
said
there
is
nothing
i
can
associate
with
them
well
yes
les
vaches
i
believe
you
had
better
count
that
question
out
i
wasted
a
good
many
very
well
let
us
try
again
he
replied
with
a
forced
unconcern
though
the
answer
seemed
to
interest
him
for
les
vaches
meant
the
cows
otherwise
known
as
the
police
no
lawyer
could
have
revelled
in
an
opportunity
for
putting
leading
questions
more
ruthlessly
than
did
kennedy
he
snapped
out
his
words
sharply
and
unexpectedly
electric
light
he
emphasised
broadway
she
answered
endeavouring
to
force
a
new
association
of
ideas
to
replace
one
which
she
strove
to
conceal
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
i
could
see
that
the
indicator
showed
a
tremendously
increased
heart
action
as
for
the
reaction
time
i
noted
that
it
was
growing
longer
and
more
significant
remorselessly
he
pressed
his
words
home
mentally
i
cursed
him
pittsburg
she
cried
at
random
no
answer
again
no
answer
he
hurried
his
words
i
was
leaning
forward
tense
with
excitement
and
sympathy
silence
and
a
fluttering
of
the
blood
pressure
indicator
as
the
last
word
was
uttered
her
air
of
frightened
defiance
was
swept
away
with
a
cry
of
anguish
she
swayed
to
her
feet
no
no
doctor
you
must
not
you
must
not
she
cried
with
outstretched
arms
why
do
you
pick
out
those
words
of
all
others
can
it
be
if
i
had
not
caught
her
i
believe
she
would
have
fainted
the
indicator
showed
a
heart
alternately
throbbing
with
feverish
excitement
and
almost
stopping
with
fear
what
would
kennedy
do
next
i
wondered
determined
to
shut
him
off
as
soon
as
i
possibly
could
from
the
moment
i
had
seen
her
i
had
been
under
her
spell
mine
should
have
been
fletcher
place
i
knew
though
i
can
not
but
say
that
i
felt
a
certain
grim
pleasure
in
supporting
even
momentarily
such
a
woman
in
her
time
of
need
can
it
be
that
you
have
guessed
what
no
one
in
the
world
no
not
even
dear
old
jack
dreams
oh
i
shall
go
mad
mad
mad
kennedy
was
on
his
feet
in
an
instant
advancing
toward
her
the
look
in
his
eyes
was
answer
enough
for
her
she
knew
that
he
knew
and
she
paled
and
shuddered
shrinking
away
from
him
miss
bond
he
said
in
a
voice
that
forced
attention
it
was
low
and
vibrating
with
feeling
miss
bond
have
you
ever
told
a
lie
to
shield
a
friend
yes
she
said
her
eyes
meeting
his
so
can
i
came
back
the
same
tense
voice
when
i
know
the
truth
about
that
then
for
the
first
time
tears
came
in
a
storm
her
breath
was
quick
and
feverish
no
one
will
ever
believe
no
one
will
understand
they
will
say
that
i
killed
him
that
i
murdered
through
it
all
i
stood
almost
speechless
puzzled
what
did
it
all
mean
no
said
kennedy
no
for
they
will
never
know
of
never
know
never
if
in
the
end
justice
is
done
have
you
the
will
or
did
you
destroy
it
it
was
a
bold
stroke
yes
no
here
it
is
how
could
i
destroy
it
even
though
it
was
burning
out
my
very
soul
she
literally
tore
the
paper
from
the
bosom
of
her
dress
and
cast
it
from
her
in
horror
and
terror
kennedy
picked
it
up
opened
it
and
glanced
hurriedly
through
it
miss
bond
he
said
jack
shall
never
know
a
word
of
this
i
shall
tell
him
that
the
will
has
been
found
unexpectedly
in
john
fletcher
desk
among
some
other
papers
walter
swear
on
your
honour
as
a
gentleman
that
this
will
was
found
in
old
fletcher
dr
kennedy
how
can
i
ever
thank
you
she
exclaimed
sinking
wearily
down
into
a
chair
and
pressing
her
hands
to
her
throbbing
forehead
by
telling
me
just
how
you
came
by
this
will
so
that
when
you
and
fletcher
are
married
i
may
be
as
good
a
friend
without
suspicion
to
you
as
i
am
to
him
i
think
a
full
confession
would
do
you
good
miss
bond
would
you
prefer
to
have
jameson
not
hear
it
no
he
may
this
much
i
know
miss
bond
last
summer
in
paris
with
the
greenes
you
must
have
chanced
to
hear
of
pillard
the
apache
one
of
the
most
noted
cracksmen
the
world
has
ever
produced
you
sought
him
out
he
taught
you
how
to
paint
your
fingers
with
a
rubber
composition
how
to
use
an
electric
drill
how
to
use
the
jimmy
you
went
down
to
fletcherwood
by
the
back
road
about
a
quarter
after
eleven
the
night
of
the
robbery
in
the
greenes
little
electric
runabout
you
entered
the
library
by
an
unlocked
window
you
coupled
your
drill
to
the
electric
light
connections
of
the
chandelier
you
had
to
work
quickly
for
the
power
would
go
off
at
midnight
yet
you
could
not
do
the
job
later
when
they
were
sleeping
more
soundly
for
the
very
same
it
was
uncanny
as
kennedy
rushed
along
in
his
reconstruction
of
the
scene
almost
unbelievable
the
girl
watched
him
fascinated
john
fletcher
was
wakeful
that
night
somehow
or
other
he
heard
you
at
work
he
entered
the
library
and
by
the
light
streaming
from
his
bedroom
he
saw
who
it
was
in
anger
he
must
have
addressed
you
and
his
passion
got
the
better
of
his
age
he
fell
suddenly
on
the
floor
with
a
stroke
of
apoplexy
as
you
bent
over
him
he
died
but
why
did
you
ever
attempt
so
foolish
an
undertaking
did
you
know
that
other
people
knew
of
the
will
and
its
terms
that
you
were
sure
to
be
traced
out
in
the
end
if
not
by
friends
by
foes
how
did
you
suppose
you
could
profit
by
destroying
the
will
of
which
others
knew
the
provisions
any
other
woman
than
helen
bond
would
have
been
hysterical
long
before
kennedy
had
finished
pressing
home
remorselessly
one
fact
after
another
of
her
story
but
with
her
the
relief
now
after
the
tension
of
many
hours
of
concealment
seemed
to
nerve
her
to
go
to
the
end
and
tell
the
truth
what
was
it
had
she
some
secret
lover
for
whom
she
had
dared
all
to
secure
the
family
fortune
or
was
she
shielding
someone
dearer
to
her
than
her
own
reputation
why
had
kennedy
made
fletcher
withdraw
her
eyes
dropped
and
her
breast
rose
and
fell
with
suppressed
emotion
yet
i
was
hardly
prepared
for
her
reply
when
at
last
she
slowly
raised
her
head
and
looked
us
calmly
in
the
face
i
did
it
because
i
loved
neither
of
us
spoke
i
at
least
had
fallen
completely
under
the
spell
of
this
masterful
woman
right
or
wrong
i
could
not
restrain
a
feeling
of
admiration
and
amazement
yes
she
said
as
her
voice
thrilled
with
emotion
strange
as
it
may
sound
to
you
it
was
not
love
of
self
that
made
me
do
it
i
was
i
am
madly
in
love
with
jack
no
other
man
has
ever
inspired
such
respect
and
love
as
he
has
his
work
in
the
university
i
have
fairly
gloated
over
and
yet
and
yet
kennedy
can
you
not
see
that
i
am
different
from
jack
what
would
i
do
with
the
income
of
the
wife
of
even
the
dean
of
the
new
school
the
annuity
provided
for
me
in
that
will
is
paltry
i
need
millions
from
the
tiniest
baby
i
have
been
reared
that
way
i
have
always
expected
this
fortune
i
have
been
given
everything
i
wanted
but
it
is
different
when
one
is
married
you
must
have
your
own
money
i
need
a
fortune
for
then
i
could
have
the
town
house
the
country
house
the
yacht
the
motors
the
clothes
the
servants
that
i
need
they
are
as
much
a
part
of
my
life
as
your
profession
is
of
yours
i
must
have
them
and
now
it
was
all
to
slip
from
my
hands
true
it
was
to
go
in
such
a
way
by
this
last
will
as
to
make
jack
happy
in
his
new
school
i
could
have
let
that
go
if
that
was
all
there
are
other
fortunes
that
have
been
laid
at
my
feet
but
i
wanted
jack
and
i
knew
jack
wanted
me
dear
boy
he
never
could
realise
how
utterly
unhappy
intellectual
poverty
would
have
made
me
and
how
my
unhappiness
would
have
reacted
on
him
in
the
end
in
reality
this
great
and
beneficent
philanthropy
was
finally
to
blight
both
our
love
and
our
lives
what
was
i
to
do
stand
by
and
see
my
life
and
my
love
ruined
or
refuse
jack
for
the
fortune
of
a
man
i
did
not
love
helen
bond
is
not
that
kind
of
a
woman
i
said
to
myself
i
consulted
the
greatest
lawyer
i
knew
i
put
a
hypothetical
case
to
him
and
asked
his
opinion
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
him
believe
he
was
advising
me
how
to
make
an
unbreakable
will
he
told
me
of
provisions
and
clauses
to
avoid
particularly
in
making
benefactions
that
was
what
i
wanted
to
know
i
would
put
one
of
those
clauses
in
my
uncle
will
i
practised
uncle
writing
till
i
was
as
good
a
forger
of
that
clause
as
anyone
could
have
become
i
had
picked
out
the
very
words
in
his
own
handwriting
to
practise
from
then
i
went
to
paris
and
as
you
have
guessed
learned
how
to
get
things
out
of
a
safe
like
that
of
uncle
before
god
all
i
planned
to
do
was
to
get
that
will
change
it
replace
it
and
trust
that
uncle
would
never
notice
the
change
then
when
he
was
gone
i
would
have
contested
the
will
i
would
have
got
my
full
share
either
by
court
proceedings
or
by
settlement
out
of
court
you
see
i
had
planned
it
all
out
the
school
would
have
been
founded
i
we
would
have
founded
it
what
difference
i
said
did
thirty
millions
or
fifty
millions
make
to
an
impersonal
school
a
school
not
yet
even
in
existence
the
twenty
million
dollars
or
so
difference
or
even
half
of
it
meant
life
and
love
to
me
i
had
planned
to
steal
the
cash
in
the
safe
anything
to
divert
attention
from
the
will
and
make
it
look
like
a
plain
robbery
i
would
have
done
the
altering
of
the
will
that
night
and
have
returned
it
to
the
safe
before
morning
but
it
was
not
to
be
i
had
almost
opened
the
safe
when
my
uncle
entered
the
room
his
anger
completely
unnerved
me
and
from
the
moment
i
saw
him
on
the
floor
to
this
i
have
had
a
sane
thought
i
forgot
to
take
the
cash
i
forgot
everything
but
that
will
my
only
thought
was
that
i
must
get
it
and
destroy
it
i
doubt
if
i
could
have
altered
it
with
my
nerves
so
upset
there
now
you
have
my
whole
story
i
am
at
your
no
said
kennedy
believe
me
there
is
a
mental
statute
of
limitations
that
as
far
as
jameson
and
myself
are
concerned
has
already
erased
this
affair
walter
will
you
find
fletcher
i
found
the
professor
pacing
up
and
down
the
gravel
walk
impatiently
fletcher
said
kennedy
a
night
rest
is
all
miss
bond
really
needs
it
is
simply
a
case
of
overwrought
nerves
and
it
will
pass
off
of
itself
still
i
would
advise
a
change
of
scene
as
soon
as
possible
good
afternoon
miss
bond
and
my
best
wishes
for
your
good
afternoon
kennedy
good
afternoon
i
for
one
was
glad
to
make
my
escape
a
later
kennedy
with
excitement
was
racing
me
in
the
car
up
to
the
greenes
again
we
literally
burst
unannounced
into
the
on
the
porch
fletcher
fletcher
cried
kennedy
look
what
walter
and
i
have
just
discovered
in
a
tin
poked
off
in
the
back
of
your
desk
fletcher
seized
the
will
and
by
the
dim
light
that
shone
through
from
the
hall
read
it
hastily
thank
god
he
cried
the
school
is
provided
for
as
i
is
it
glorious
murmured
helen
true
to
my
instinct
i
muttered
another
good
newspaper
yarn
iii
the
bacteriological
detective
kennedy
was
deeply
immersed
in
writing
a
lecture
on
the
chemical
compositions
of
various
bacterial
toxins
and
antitoxins
a
thing
which
was
as
unfamiliar
to
me
as
kamchatka
but
as
familiar
to
kennedy
as
broadway
and
street
really
he
remarked
laying
down
his
and
lighting
his
cigar
for
the
hundredth
time
the
more
one
thinks
of
how
the
modern
criminal
misses
his
opportunities
the
more
astonishing
it
seems
why
do
they
stick
to
pistols
chloroform
and
prussic
acid
when
there
is
such
a
splendid
assortment
of
refined
methods
they
might
employ
give
it
up
old
man
i
replied
helplessly
unless
it
is
because
they
have
any
imagination
i
hope
they
do
use
them
what
would
become
of
my
business
if
they
did
how
would
you
ever
get
a
really
dramatic
news
feature
for
the
star
out
of
such
a
thing
line
marks
route
taken
by
fatal
germ
cross
indicates
spot
where
antitoxin
attacked
it
ha
ha
not
much
for
the
yellow
journals
in
that
to
my
mind
walter
it
would
be
the
height
of
the
dramatic
far
more
dramatic
than
sending
a
bullet
into
a
man
any
fool
can
shoot
a
pistol
or
cut
a
throat
but
it
takes
brains
to
be
it
may
be
so
i
admitted
and
went
on
reading
while
kennedy
scratched
away
diligently
on
his
lecture
i
mention
this
conversation
both
because
it
bears
on
my
story
by
a
rather
peculiar
coincidence
and
because
it
showed
me
a
new
side
of
kennedy
amazing
researches
he
was
as
much
interested
in
bacteria
as
in
chemistry
and
the
story
is
one
of
bacteria
it
was
perhaps
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
when
the
buzzer
on
our
hall
door
sounded
imagine
my
surprise
on
opening
the
door
to
discover
the
slight
figure
of
what
appeared
to
be
a
most
fascinating
young
lady
who
was
heavily
veiled
she
was
in
a
state
almost
bordering
on
hysteria
as
even
i
in
spite
of
my
usual
obtuseness
noticed
is
professor
kennedy
in
she
inquired
anxiously
yes
i
replied
opening
the
door
into
our
study
she
advanced
toward
him
repeating
her
inquiry
i
am
professor
kennedy
pray
be
seated
he
said
the
presence
of
a
lady
in
our
apartment
was
such
a
novelty
that
really
i
forgot
to
disappear
but
busied
myself
straightening
the
furniture
and
opening
a
window
to
allow
the
odour
of
stale
tobacco
to
escape
my
name
is
eveline
bisbee
she
began
i
have
heard
professor
kennedy
that
you
are
an
adept
at
getting
at
the
bottom
of
difficult
you
flatter
me
he
said
in
acknowledgment
who
was
so
foolish
as
to
tell
you
that
a
friend
who
has
heard
of
the
kerr
parker
case
she
replied
i
beg
your
pardon
i
interrupted
i
did
mean
to
intrude
i
think
i
go
out
i
be
back
in
an
hour
or
please
jameson
it
is
jameson
is
it
not
i
bowed
in
surprise
if
it
is
possible
i
wish
you
would
stay
and
hear
my
story
i
am
told
that
you
and
professor
kennedy
always
work
it
was
my
turn
to
be
embarrassed
by
the
compliment
mrs
fletcher
of
great
neck
she
explained
has
told
me
i
believe
professor
kennedy
performed
a
great
service
for
the
fletchers
though
i
do
not
know
what
it
was
at
any
rate
i
have
come
to
you
with
my
case
in
which
i
have
small
hope
of
obtaining
assistance
unless
you
can
help
me
if
professor
kennedy
can
not
solve
it
well
i
afraid
nobody
she
paused
a
moment
then
added
no
doubt
you
have
read
of
the
death
of
my
guardian
the
other
of
course
we
had
who
did
not
know
that
jim
bisbee
the
southern
california
had
died
suddenly
of
typhoid
fever
at
the
private
hospital
of
bell
where
he
had
been
taken
from
his
magnificent
apartment
on
riverside
drive
kennedy
and
i
had
discussed
it
at
the
time
we
had
commented
on
the
artificiality
of
the
twentieth
century
no
longer
did
people
have
homes
they
had
apartments
i
had
said
they
did
fall
ill
in
the
good
way
any
more
either
in
fact
they
even
hired
special
rooms
to
die
in
they
hired
halls
for
funeral
services
it
was
a
wonder
that
they
did
hire
graves
it
was
all
part
of
our
twentieth
century
of
tradition
indeed
we
did
know
about
the
death
of
jim
bisbee
but
there
was
nothing
mysterious
about
it
it
was
just
typical
in
all
its
surroundings
of
the
first
decade
of
the
twentieth
century
in
a
great
artificial
city
a
lonely
death
of
a
great
man
surrounded
by
all
that
money
could
buy
we
had
read
of
his
ward
too
the
beautiful
miss
eveline
bisbee
a
distant
relation
as
under
the
heat
of
the
room
and
her
excitement
she
raised
her
veil
we
were
very
much
interested
in
her
at
least
i
am
sure
that
even
kennedy
had
by
this
time
completely
forgotten
the
lecture
on
toxins
there
is
something
about
my
guardian
death
she
began
in
a
low
and
tremulous
voice
that
i
am
sure
will
bear
investigating
it
may
be
only
a
woman
foolish
fears
but
i
have
told
this
to
a
soul
till
now
except
fletcher
my
guardian
had
as
you
perhaps
know
spent
his
summer
at
his
country
place
at
bisbee
hall
new
jersey
from
which
he
returned
rather
suddenly
about
a
week
ago
our
friends
thought
it
merely
a
strange
whim
that
he
should
return
to
the
city
before
the
summer
was
fairly
over
but
it
was
not
the
day
before
he
returned
his
gardener
fell
sick
of
typhoid
that
decided
bisbee
to
return
to
the
city
on
the
following
day
imagine
his
consternation
to
find
his
valet
stricken
the
very
next
morning
of
course
they
motored
to
new
york
immediately
then
he
wired
to
me
at
newport
and
together
we
opened
his
apartment
at
the
louis
quinze
but
that
was
not
to
be
the
end
of
it
one
after
another
the
servants
at
bisbee
hall
were
taken
with
the
disease
until
five
of
them
were
down
then
came
the
last
blow
bisbee
fell
a
victim
in
new
york
so
far
i
have
been
spared
but
who
knows
how
much
longer
it
will
last
i
have
been
so
frightened
that
i
have
eaten
a
meal
in
the
apartment
since
i
came
back
when
i
am
hungry
i
simply
steal
out
to
a
hotel
a
different
one
every
time
i
never
drink
any
water
except
that
which
i
have
surreptitiously
boiled
in
my
own
room
over
a
disinfectants
and
germicides
have
been
used
by
the
gallon
and
still
i
do
feel
safe
even
the
health
authorities
do
remove
my
fears
with
my
guardian
death
i
had
begun
to
feel
that
possibly
it
was
over
but
no
this
morning
another
servant
who
came
up
from
the
hall
last
week
was
taken
sick
and
the
doctor
pronounces
that
typhoid
too
will
i
be
the
next
is
it
just
a
foolish
fear
why
does
it
pursue
us
to
new
york
why
did
it
stop
at
bisbee
hall
i
do
think
i
ever
saw
a
living
creature
more
overcome
by
horror
by
an
invisible
deadly
fear
that
was
why
it
was
doubly
horrible
in
a
girl
so
attractive
as
eveline
bisbee
as
i
listened
i
felt
how
terrible
it
must
be
to
be
pursued
by
such
a
fear
what
must
it
be
to
be
dogged
by
a
disease
as
relentlessly
as
the
typhoid
had
dogged
her
if
it
had
been
some
great
but
visible
tangible
peril
how
gladly
i
could
have
faced
it
merely
for
the
smile
of
a
woman
like
this
but
it
was
a
peril
that
only
knowledge
and
patience
could
meet
instinctively
i
turned
toward
kennedy
my
own
mind
being
an
absolute
blank
is
there
anyone
you
suspect
of
being
the
cause
of
such
an
epidemic
he
asked
i
may
as
well
tell
you
right
now
that
i
have
already
formed
two
theories
one
perfectly
natural
the
other
diabolical
tell
me
well
i
had
expected
to
receive
a
fortune
of
one
million
dollars
free
and
clear
by
his
will
and
this
morning
i
am
informed
by
his
lawyer
james
denny
that
a
new
will
had
been
made
it
is
still
one
million
but
the
remainder
instead
of
going
to
a
number
of
charities
in
which
he
was
known
to
be
interested
goes
to
form
a
trust
fund
for
the
bisbee
school
of
mechanical
arts
of
which
denny
is
the
sole
trustee
of
course
i
do
not
know
much
about
my
guardian
interests
while
he
was
alive
but
it
strikes
me
as
strange
that
he
should
have
changed
so
radically
and
besides
the
new
will
is
so
worded
that
if
i
die
without
children
my
million
also
goes
to
this
school
location
unnamed
i
ca
help
wondering
about
it
why
should
you
wonder
at
least
what
other
reasons
have
you
for
wondering
oh
i
ca
express
them
maybe
after
all
it
only
a
woman
silly
intuition
but
often
i
have
thought
in
the
past
few
days
about
this
illness
of
my
guardian
it
was
so
queer
he
was
always
so
careful
and
you
know
the
rich
do
often
have
you
have
no
reason
to
suppose
that
it
was
not
typhoid
fever
of
which
he
died
she
hesitated
no
she
replied
but
if
you
had
known
bisbee
you
would
think
it
strange
too
he
had
a
horror
of
infectious
and
contagious
diseases
his
apartment
and
his
country
home
were
models
no
sanitarium
could
have
been
more
punctilious
he
lived
what
one
of
his
friends
called
an
antiseptic
life
maybe
i
am
foolish
but
it
keeps
getting
closer
and
closer
to
me
now
and
well
i
wish
you
look
into
the
case
please
set
my
mind
at
rest
and
assure
me
that
nothing
is
wrong
that
it
is
all
i
will
help
you
miss
bisbee
night
i
want
to
take
a
trip
quietly
to
bisbee
hall
you
will
see
that
it
is
all
right
that
i
have
the
proper
letters
so
i
can
investigate
i
shall
never
forget
the
mute
and
eloquent
thanks
with
which
she
said
good
night
after
kennedy
promise
kennedy
sat
with
his
eyes
shaded
under
his
hand
for
fully
an
hour
after
she
had
left
then
he
suddenly
jumped
up
walter
he
said
let
us
go
over
to
bell
i
know
the
head
nurse
there
we
may
possibly
learn
as
we
sat
in
the
with
its
thick
oriental
rugs
and
handsome
mahogany
furniture
i
found
myself
going
back
to
our
conversation
of
the
early
evening
by
jove
kennedy
you
were
right
i
exclaimed
if
there
is
anything
in
this
idea
of
hers
it
is
indeed
the
height
of
the
dramatic
it
is
diabolical
no
ordinary
mortal
would
ever
be
capable
of
just
then
the
head
nurse
came
in
a
large
woman
breathing
of
germlessness
and
cheerfulness
in
her
spotless
uniform
we
were
shown
every
courtesy
there
was
in
fact
nothing
to
conceal
the
visit
set
at
rest
my
last
suspicion
that
perhaps
jim
bisbee
had
been
poisoned
by
a
drug
the
charts
of
his
temperature
and
the
sincerity
of
the
nurse
were
absolutely
convincing
it
had
really
been
typhoid
and
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
pursuing
that
inquiry
further
back
at
the
apartment
craig
began
packing
his
suitcase
with
the
few
things
he
would
need
for
a
journey
i
going
out
to
bisbee
hall
for
a
few
days
walter
and
if
you
could
find
it
convenient
to
come
along
i
should
like
to
have
your
to
tell
you
the
truth
craig
i
am
afraid
to
go
i
said
you
need
be
i
going
down
to
the
army
post
on
governor
island
first
to
be
vaccinated
against
typhoid
then
i
am
going
to
wait
a
few
hours
till
it
takes
effect
before
going
it
the
only
place
in
the
city
where
one
can
be
inoculated
against
it
so
far
as
i
know
while
three
inoculations
are
really
best
i
understand
that
one
is
sufficient
for
ordinary
protection
and
that
is
all
we
shall
need
if
you
sure
of
it
almost
very
well
craig
i
down
at
the
army
post
the
next
morning
we
had
no
difficulty
in
being
inoculated
against
the
disease
the
work
of
immunising
our
army
was
going
on
at
that
time
and
several
thousands
of
soldiers
in
various
parts
of
the
country
had
already
been
vaccinated
with
the
best
of
results
do
many
civilians
come
over
to
be
vaccinated
asked
craig
of
major
carroll
the
surgeon
in
charge
not
many
for
very
few
have
heard
of
it
he
replied
i
suppose
you
keep
a
record
of
only
their
names
we
ca
follow
them
up
outside
the
army
to
see
how
it
works
still
when
they
come
to
us
as
you
and
jameson
have
done
we
are
perfectly
willing
to
vaccinate
them
the
army
medical
corps
takes
the
position
that
if
it
is
good
for
the
army
it
is
good
for
civil
life
and
as
long
as
only
a
few
civilians
apply
we
are
perfectly
willing
to
do
it
for
a
fee
covering
the
and
would
you
let
me
see
the
list
certainly
you
may
look
it
over
in
a
kennedy
glanced
hurriedly
through
the
short
list
of
names
pulled
out
his
notebook
made
an
entry
and
handed
the
list
back
thank
you
bisbee
hall
was
a
splendid
place
set
in
the
heart
of
a
great
park
whose
area
was
measured
by
square
miles
rather
than
by
acres
but
craig
did
not
propose
to
stay
there
for
he
arranged
for
accommodations
in
a
town
where
we
were
to
take
our
meals
also
it
was
late
when
we
arrived
and
we
spent
a
restless
night
for
the
inoculation
it
was
any
worse
than
a
light
attack
of
the
grippe
and
in
the
morning
we
were
both
all
right
again
after
the
passing
of
what
is
called
the
negative
i
for
one
felt
much
safer
the
town
was
very
much
excited
over
the
epidemic
at
the
hall
and
if
i
had
been
wondering
why
craig
wanted
me
along
my
wonder
was
soon
set
at
rest
he
had
me
scouring
the
town
and
country
looking
up
every
case
or
rumour
of
typhoid
for
miles
around
i
made
the
local
weekly
paper
my
headquarters
and
the
editor
was
very
obliging
he
let
me
read
all
his
news
letters
from
his
local
correspondent
at
every
crossroads
i
waded
through
accounts
of
new
calves
and
colts
new
fences
and
barns
who
sundayed
with
his
brother
and
soon
had
a
list
of
all
the
cases
in
that
part
of
the
country
it
was
not
a
long
one
but
it
was
scattered
after
i
had
traced
them
out
following
instructions
they
showed
nothing
except
that
they
were
unrelated
to
the
epidemic
at
the
hall
meanwhile
kennedy
was
very
busy
there
he
had
a
microscope
and
slides
and
and
chemicals
for
testing
things
and
i
do
know
what
all
for
there
was
not
time
to
initiate
me
into
all
the
mysteries
he
tested
the
water
from
the
various
driven
wells
and
in
the
and
the
milk
from
the
cows
he
tried
to
find
out
what
food
had
come
in
from
outside
though
there
was
practically
none
for
the
hall
was
there
was
no
stone
he
left
unturned
when
i
rejoined
him
that
night
he
was
clearly
perplexed
i
do
think
my
report
decreased
his
perplexity
either
there
is
only
one
thing
left
as
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
discover
after
one
day
work
he
said
after
we
had
gone
over
our
activities
for
the
day
jim
bisbee
never
drank
the
water
from
his
own
wells
he
always
drank
a
bottled
water
shipped
down
from
a
camp
of
his
in
new
york
state
where
he
had
a
remarkable
mountain
spring
i
tested
a
number
of
the
full
bottles
at
the
hall
but
they
were
perfectly
pure
there
a
trace
of
the
bacillus
typhosus
in
any
of
them
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
after
all
that
was
not
the
thing
to
do
i
should
test
the
empty
ones
but
there
were
any
empty
ones
they
told
me
they
had
all
been
taken
down
to
the
freight
station
yesterday
to
be
shipped
back
to
the
camp
i
hope
they
have
gone
yet
let
drive
around
and
see
if
they
are
the
was
just
leaving
but
when
he
learned
we
were
from
the
hall
he
consented
to
let
us
examine
the
bottles
they
were
corked
and
in
wooden
cases
which
protected
them
perfectly
by
the
light
of
the
station
lamps
and
the
aid
of
a
kennedy
examined
them
on
the
outside
and
satisfied
himself
that
after
being
replaced
in
the
wooden
cases
the
bottles
themselves
had
not
been
handled
will
you
let
me
borrow
some
of
these
bottles
he
asked
the
agent
i
give
you
my
word
that
they
will
be
returned
safely
if
necessary
i
get
an
order
for
the
reluctantly
yielded
especially
as
a
small
green
banknote
figured
in
the
transaction
craig
and
i
tenderly
lifted
the
big
bottles
in
their
cases
into
our
trap
and
drove
back
to
our
rooms
in
the
hotel
it
quite
excited
the
to
see
us
drive
up
with
a
lot
of
empty
bottles
and
carry
them
but
i
had
long
ago
given
up
having
any
fear
of
public
opinion
in
carrying
out
anything
craig
wanted
in
our
room
we
worked
far
into
the
night
craig
carefully
swabbed
out
the
bottom
and
sides
of
each
bottle
by
inserting
a
little
piece
of
cotton
on
the
end
of
a
long
wire
then
he
squeezed
the
water
out
of
the
cotton
swab
on
small
glass
slides
coated
with
or
japanese
seaweed
a
medium
in
which
multiply
rapidly
he
put
the
slides
away
in
a
little
oven
with
an
which
he
had
brought
along
leaving
them
to
remain
overnight
at
blood
heat
i
had
noticed
all
this
time
that
he
was
very
particular
not
to
touch
any
of
the
bottles
on
the
outside
as
for
me
i
would
have
touched
them
for
the
world
in
fact
i
was
getting
so
i
hesitated
to
touch
anything
i
was
almost
afraid
to
breathe
though
i
knew
there
was
no
harm
in
that
however
it
was
not
danger
of
infection
in
touching
the
bottles
that
made
craig
so
careful
he
had
noted
in
the
dim
light
of
the
station
lamps
what
seemed
to
be
on
the
bottles
and
they
had
interested
him
in
fact
had
decided
him
on
a
further
investigation
of
the
bottles
i
am
now
going
to
bring
out
these
very
faint
on
the
bottles
remarked
craig
proceeding
with
his
examination
in
the
better
light
of
our
room
here
is
some
powder
known
to
chemists
as
powder
mercury
and
chalk
i
sprinkle
it
over
the
faint
markings
so
and
then
i
brush
it
off
with
a
brush
lightly
that
brings
out
the
imprint
much
more
clearly
as
you
can
see
for
instance
if
you
place
your
dry
thumb
on
a
piece
of
white
paper
you
leave
no
visible
impression
if
grey
powder
is
sprinkled
over
the
spot
and
then
brushed
off
a
distinct
impression
is
seen
if
the
impression
of
the
fingers
is
left
on
something
soft
like
wax
it
is
often
best
to
use
printers
ink
to
bring
out
the
ridges
and
patterns
of
the
and
so
on
for
various
materials
quite
a
science
has
been
built
up
around
i
wish
i
had
that
enlarging
camera
which
i
have
in
my
laboratory
however
my
ordinary
camera
will
do
for
all
i
want
is
to
preserve
a
record
of
these
marks
and
i
can
enlarge
the
photographs
later
in
the
morning
i
will
photograph
these
marks
and
you
can
do
the
developing
of
the
films
we
improvise
the
bathroom
as
a
and
get
everything
ready
so
that
we
can
start
in
bright
and
we
were
indeed
up
early
one
never
has
difficulty
in
getting
up
early
in
the
country
it
is
so
noisy
at
least
to
a
man
city
noise
at
five
is
sepulchral
silence
compared
with
bucolic
activity
at
that
hour
there
were
a
dozen
negatives
which
i
set
about
developing
after
craig
had
used
up
all
our
films
meanwhile
he
busied
himself
adjusting
his
microscope
and
and
getting
the
agar
slides
ready
for
examination
rolled
up
i
was
deeply
immersed
in
my
work
when
i
heard
a
shout
in
the
next
room
and
the
bathroom
door
flew
open
confound
you
kennedy
do
you
want
to
ruin
these
films
i
cried
he
shut
the
door
with
a
bang
hurrah
walter
he
exclaimed
i
think
i
have
it
at
last
i
have
just
found
some
most
promising
colonies
of
the
bacilli
on
one
of
my
i
almost
dropped
the
pan
of
acid
i
was
holding
in
my
excitement
well
i
said
concealing
my
own
surprise
i
found
out
something
too
every
one
of
these
so
far
is
from
the
same
pair
of
we
scarcely
ate
any
breakfast
and
were
soon
on
our
way
up
to
the
hall
craig
had
provided
himself
at
the
local
stationer
with
an
such
as
is
used
for
rubber
stamps
at
the
hall
he
proceeded
to
get
the
impressions
of
the
fingers
and
thumbs
of
all
the
servants
it
was
quite
a
long
and
difficult
piece
of
work
to
compare
the
we
had
taken
with
those
photographed
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
writers
descant
on
the
ease
with
which
criminals
are
traced
by
this
system
devised
by
the
famous
galton
however
we
at
last
finished
the
job
between
us
or
rather
craig
finished
it
with
an
occasional
remark
from
me
his
dexterity
amazed
me
it
was
more
than
mere
book
knowledge
for
a
moment
we
sat
regarding
each
other
hopelessly
none
of
the
taken
at
the
hall
tallied
with
the
photographed
prints
then
craig
rang
for
the
housekeeper
a
faithful
old
soul
whom
even
the
typhoid
scare
could
not
budge
from
her
post
are
you
sure
i
have
seen
all
the
servants
who
were
at
the
hall
while
bisbee
was
here
asked
craig
why
no
sir
you
did
ask
that
you
asked
to
see
all
who
are
here
now
there
is
only
one
who
has
left
the
cook
bridget
fallon
she
left
a
couple
of
days
ago
said
she
was
going
back
to
new
york
to
get
another
job
glad
enough
i
was
to
get
rid
of
her
too
for
she
was
drunk
most
of
the
time
after
the
typhoid
well
walter
i
guess
we
shall
have
to
go
back
to
new
york
again
then
exclaimed
kennedy
oh
i
beg
pardon
rawson
for
interrupting
thank
you
ever
so
much
where
did
bridget
come
from
she
came
well
recommended
sir
here
is
the
letter
in
my
she
had
been
employed
by
the
at
shelter
island
before
she
came
i
may
keep
this
letter
asked
craig
scanning
it
quickly
by
the
way
where
were
the
bottles
of
spring
water
kept
in
the
did
bridget
take
charge
of
them
did
bisbee
have
any
guests
during
the
last
week
that
he
was
here
only
denny
one
h
exclaimed
craig
well
it
will
not
be
so
hard
for
us
to
unravel
this
matter
after
all
when
we
get
back
to
the
city
we
must
make
that
noon
train
walter
there
is
nothing
more
for
us
to
do
emerging
from
the
tube
at
ninth
street
craig
hustled
me
into
a
taxicab
and
in
almost
no
time
we
were
at
police
headquarters
fortunately
inspector
barney
was
in
and
in
an
amiable
mood
too
for
kennedy
had
been
careful
that
the
central
office
received
a
large
share
of
credit
for
the
kerr
parker
case
craig
sketched
hastily
the
details
of
this
new
case
face
was
a
study
his
honest
blue
irish
eyes
fairly
bulged
in
wonder
and
when
craig
concluded
with
a
request
for
help
i
think
would
have
given
him
anything
in
the
office
just
to
figure
in
the
case
first
i
want
one
of
your
men
to
go
to
the
surrogate
office
and
get
the
original
of
the
will
i
shall
return
it
within
a
couple
of
hours
all
i
want
to
do
is
to
make
a
photographic
copy
then
another
man
must
find
this
lawyer
james
denny
and
in
some
way
get
his
you
must
arrange
that
yourself
and
send
another
fellow
up
to
the
employment
offices
on
fourth
avenue
and
have
him
locate
this
cook
bridget
fallon
i
want
her
too
perhaps
she
had
better
be
detained
for
i
do
want
her
to
get
away
oh
and
say
do
you
want
to
finish
this
case
up
like
the
crack
of
a
whip
i
game
sir
what
of
it
let
me
see
it
is
now
four
if
you
can
get
hold
of
all
these
people
in
time
i
think
i
shall
be
ready
for
the
final
scene
say
at
nine
you
know
how
to
arrange
it
have
them
all
present
at
my
laboratory
at
nine
and
i
promise
we
shall
have
a
story
that
will
get
into
the
morning
papers
with
leaded
type
on
the
front
now
walter
he
added
as
we
hurried
down
to
the
taxicab
again
i
want
you
to
drop
off
at
the
department
of
health
with
this
card
to
the
commissioner
i
believe
you
know
leslie
well
ask
him
if
he
knows
anything
about
this
bridget
fallon
i
will
go
on
to
the
laboratory
and
get
my
apparatus
ready
you
need
come
up
till
nine
old
fellow
for
i
shall
be
busy
till
then
but
be
sure
when
you
come
that
you
bring
the
record
of
this
fallon
woman
if
you
have
to
beg
borrow
or
steal
i
did
understand
it
but
i
took
the
card
and
obeyed
implicitly
it
is
needless
to
say
that
i
was
keyed
up
to
the
greatest
pitch
of
excitement
during
my
interview
with
the
health
commissioner
when
i
finally
got
in
to
see
him
i
had
talked
to
him
long
before
a
great
light
struck
me
and
i
began
to
see
what
craig
was
driving
at
the
commissioner
saw
it
first
if
you
do
mind
he
said
after
i
had
told
him
as
much
of
my
story
as
i
could
will
you
call
up
professor
kennedy
and
tell
him
i
like
very
much
to
be
present
myself
certainly
i
will
i
replied
glad
to
get
my
errand
done
in
fashion
in
that
way
things
must
have
been
running
smoothly
for
while
i
was
sitting
in
our
apartment
after
dinner
impatiently
waiting
for
eight
when
the
commissioner
had
promised
to
call
for
me
and
go
up
to
the
laboratory
the
telephone
rang
it
was
craig
walter
might
i
ask
a
favour
of
you
he
said
when
the
commissioner
comes
ask
him
to
stop
at
the
louis
quinze
and
bring
miss
bisbee
up
too
tell
her
it
is
important
no
more
now
things
are
going
ahead
promptly
at
nine
we
were
assembled
a
curious
crowd
the
health
commissioner
and
the
inspector
being
members
of
the
same
political
party
greeted
each
other
by
their
first
names
miss
bisbee
was
nervous
bridget
was
abusive
denny
was
sullen
as
for
kennedy
he
was
as
usual
as
cool
as
a
lump
of
ice
and
i
well
i
just
sat
on
my
feelings
to
keep
myself
quiet
at
one
end
of
the
room
craig
had
placed
a
large
white
sheet
such
as
he
used
in
his
stereopticon
lectures
while
at
the
top
of
the
tier
of
seats
that
made
a
sort
of
little
amphitheatre
out
of
his
his
stereopticon
sputtered
moving
pictures
eh
said
inspector
not
exactly
said
craig
though
yes
they
will
be
moving
in
another
sense
now
if
we
are
all
ready
i
switch
off
the
electric
the
calcium
sputtered
some
more
and
a
square
of
light
was
thrown
on
the
sheet
kennedy
snapped
a
little
announcer
such
as
lecturers
use
let
me
invite
your
attention
to
these
enlargements
of
he
began
as
a
huge
thumb
appeared
on
the
screen
here
we
have
a
series
of
which
i
will
show
one
after
another
slowly
they
are
all
of
the
fingers
of
the
same
person
and
they
were
found
on
some
empty
bottles
of
spring
water
used
at
bisbee
hall
during
the
two
weeks
previous
to
the
departure
of
bisbee
for
new
york
here
are
in
succession
the
of
the
various
servants
employed
about
the
house
and
of
a
guest
added
craig
with
a
slight
change
of
tone
they
differ
markedly
from
the
on
the
glass
he
continued
as
one
after
another
appeared
all
except
this
last
one
that
is
identical
it
is
inspector
what
we
call
a
composite
type
of
in
this
case
a
combination
of
what
is
called
the
and
no
sound
broke
the
stillness
save
the
sputtering
of
the
oxygen
on
the
calcium
of
the
stereopticon
the
owner
of
the
fingers
from
which
these
prints
were
made
is
in
this
room
it
was
from
typhoid
germs
on
these
fingers
that
the
fever
was
introduced
into
the
drinking
water
at
bisbee
kennedy
paused
to
emphasise
the
statement
then
continued
i
am
now
going
to
ask
leslie
to
give
us
a
little
talk
on
a
recent
discovery
in
the
field
of
typhoid
fever
you
understand
commissioner
what
i
mean
i
believe
perfectly
shall
i
mention
names
no
not
well
began
leslie
clearing
his
throat
within
the
past
year
or
two
we
have
made
a
most
weird
and
startling
discovery
in
typhoid
fever
we
have
found
what
we
now
call
carriers
persons
who
do
not
have
the
disease
themselves
perhaps
never
have
had
it
but
who
are
literally
living
of
the
typhoid
bacillus
it
is
positively
uncanny
everywhere
they
go
they
scatter
the
disease
down
at
the
department
we
have
the
records
of
a
number
of
such
instances
and
our
men
in
the
research
laboratories
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
far
from
being
of
rare
occurrence
these
cases
are
comparatively
common
i
have
in
mind
one
particular
case
of
a
servant
girl
who
during
the
past
five
or
six
years
has
been
employed
in
several
families
in
every
family
typhoid
fever
has
later
broken
out
experts
have
traced
out
at
least
thirty
cases
and
several
deaths
due
to
this
one
person
in
another
case
we
found
an
epidemic
up
in
harlem
to
be
due
to
a
typhoid
carrier
on
a
remote
farm
in
connecticut
this
carrier
innocently
enough
it
is
true
contaminated
the
coming
from
that
farm
the
result
was
over
fifty
cases
of
typhoid
here
in
this
city
however
to
return
to
the
case
of
the
servant
i
have
mentioned
last
spring
we
had
her
under
surveillance
but
as
there
was
no
law
by
which
we
could
restrain
her
permanently
she
is
still
at
large
i
think
one
of
the
sunday
papers
at
the
time
had
an
account
of
her
they
called
her
bridget
and
in
red
ink
she
was
drawn
across
the
page
in
gruesome
fashion
frying
the
skulls
of
her
victims
in
a
over
a
roaring
fire
that
particular
typhoid
carrier
i
understand
excuse
me
commissioner
if
i
interrupt
but
i
think
we
have
carried
this
part
of
the
programme
far
enough
to
be
absolutely
convincing
said
craig
thank
you
very
much
for
the
clear
way
in
which
you
have
put
craig
snapped
the
announcer
and
a
letter
appeared
on
the
screen
he
said
nothing
but
let
us
read
it
through
to
whom
it
may
concern
this
is
to
certify
that
bridget
fallon
has
been
employed
in
my
family
at
shelter
island
for
the
past
season
and
that
i
have
found
her
a
reliable
servant
and
an
excellent
cook
john
before
god
kennedy
i
innocent
screeched
bridget
do
have
me
arrested
i
innocent
i
craig
gently
but
firmly
forced
her
back
into
her
chair
again
the
announcer
snapped
this
time
the
last
page
of
will
appeared
on
the
sheet
ending
with
his
signature
and
the
witnesses
i
now
going
to
show
these
two
specimens
of
handwriting
very
greatly
enlarged
he
said
as
the
stereopticon
plates
were
shifted
again
an
author
of
many
scientific
works
lindsay
johnson
of
london
has
recently
elaborated
a
new
theory
with
regard
to
individuality
in
handwriting
he
maintains
that
in
certain
diseases
a
person
pulse
beats
are
individual
and
that
no
one
suffering
from
any
such
disease
can
control
even
for
a
brief
space
of
time
the
frequency
or
peculiar
irregularities
of
his
heart
action
as
shown
by
a
chart
recording
his
pulsation
such
a
chart
is
obtained
for
medical
purposes
by
means
of
a
sphygmograph
an
instrument
fitted
to
the
patient
forearm
and
supplied
with
a
needle
which
can
be
so
arranged
as
to
record
automatically
on
a
prepared
sheet
of
paper
the
peculiar
force
and
frequency
of
the
pulsation
or
the
pulsation
may
be
simply
observed
in
the
rise
and
fall
of
a
liquid
in
a
tube
johnson
holds
the
opinion
that
a
pen
in
the
hand
of
a
writer
serves
in
a
modified
degree
the
same
end
as
the
needle
in
the
form
of
the
sphygmograph
and
that
in
such
a
person
handwriting
one
can
see
by
projecting
the
letters
greatly
magnified
on
a
screen
the
scarcely
perceptible
turns
and
quivers
made
in
the
lines
by
the
spontaneous
action
of
that
person
peculiar
pulsation
to
prove
this
the
doctor
carried
out
an
experiment
at
charing
cross
hospital
at
his
request
a
number
of
patients
suffering
from
heart
and
kidney
diseases
wrote
the
lord
prayer
in
their
ordinary
handwriting
the
different
manuscripts
were
then
taken
and
examined
microscopically
by
throwing
them
highly
magnified
on
a
screen
the
jerks
or
involuntary
motions
due
to
the
patient
peculiar
pulsations
were
distinctly
visible
the
handwriting
of
persons
in
normal
health
says
johnson
does
not
always
show
their
pulse
beats
what
one
can
say
however
is
that
when
a
document
purporting
to
be
written
by
a
certain
person
contains
traces
of
pulse
beats
and
the
normal
handwriting
of
that
person
does
not
show
them
then
clearly
that
document
is
a
forgery
now
in
these
two
specimens
of
handwriting
which
we
have
enlarged
it
is
plain
that
the
writers
of
both
of
them
suffered
from
a
certain
peculiar
disease
of
the
heart
moreover
i
am
prepared
to
show
that
the
pulse
beats
exhibited
in
the
case
of
certain
in
one
of
these
documents
are
exhibited
in
similar
strokes
in
the
other
furthermore
i
have
ascertained
from
his
family
physician
whose
affidavit
i
have
here
that
bisbee
did
not
suffer
from
this
or
any
other
form
of
heart
disease
in
addition
to
wiring
me
that
he
refused
to
write
bridget
fallon
a
recommendation
after
the
typhoid
broke
out
in
his
country
house
also
says
he
does
not
suffer
from
heart
disease
in
any
form
from
the
tremulous
character
of
the
letters
and
figures
in
both
these
documents
which
when
magnified
is
the
more
easily
detected
i
therefore
conclude
that
both
are
forgeries
and
i
am
ready
to
go
farther
and
say
that
they
are
forgeries
from
the
same
hand
it
usually
takes
a
couple
of
weeks
after
infection
for
typhoid
to
develop
a
time
sufficient
in
itself
to
remove
suspicion
from
acts
which
might
otherwise
be
scrutinised
very
carefully
if
happening
immediately
before
the
disease
developed
i
may
add
also
that
it
is
well
known
that
stout
people
do
very
poorly
when
they
contract
typhoid
especially
if
they
are
old
bisbee
was
both
stout
and
old
to
contract
typhoid
was
for
him
a
virtual
knowing
all
these
facts
a
certain
person
purposely
sought
out
a
crafty
means
of
introducing
typhoid
fever
into
bisbee
family
that
person
furthermore
was
inoculated
against
typhoid
three
times
during
the
month
before
the
disease
was
devilishly
and
surreptitiously
introduced
into
bisbee
hall
in
order
to
protect
himself
or
herself
should
it
become
necessary
for
that
person
to
visit
bisbee
hall
that
person
i
believe
is
the
one
who
suffered
from
an
aneurism
of
the
heart
the
writer
or
rather
the
forger
of
the
two
documents
i
have
shown
by
one
of
which
he
or
she
was
to
profit
greatly
by
the
death
of
bisbee
and
the
founding
of
an
alleged
school
in
a
distant
part
of
the
country
a
subterfuge
if
you
recall
used
in
at
least
one
famous
case
for
which
the
convicted
perpetrator
is
now
under
a
life
sentence
in
sing
sing
i
will
ask
leslie
to
take
this
stethoscope
and
examine
the
hearts
of
everyone
in
the
room
and
tell
me
whether
there
is
anyone
here
suffering
from
an
the
calcium
light
ceased
to
sputter
one
person
after
another
was
examined
by
the
health
commissioner
was
it
merely
my
imagination
or
did
i
really
hear
a
heart
beating
with
wild
leaps
as
if
it
would
burst
the
bonds
of
its
prison
and
make
its
escape
if
possible
perhaps
it
was
only
the
engine
of
the
commissioner
machine
out
on
the
campus
driveway
i
do
know
at
any
rate
he
went
silently
from
one
to
the
other
betraying
not
even
by
his
actions
what
he
discovered
with
the
stethoscope
the
suspense
was
terrible
i
felt
miss
bisbee
hand
involuntarily
grasp
my
arm
convulsively
without
disturbing
the
silence
i
reached
a
glass
of
water
standing
near
me
on
craig
and
handed
it
to
her
the
commissioner
was
bending
over
the
lawyer
trying
to
adjust
the
stethoscope
better
to
his
ears
the
lawyer
head
was
resting
heavily
on
his
hand
and
he
was
heaped
up
in
an
awkward
position
in
the
cramped
seat
it
seemed
an
age
as
leslie
tried
to
adjust
the
stethoscope
even
craig
felt
the
excitement
while
the
commissioner
hesitated
kennedy
reached
over
and
impatiently
switched
on
the
electric
light
in
full
force
as
the
light
flooded
the
room
blinding
us
for
the
instant
the
large
form
of
leslie
stood
between
us
and
the
lawyer
what
does
the
stethoscope
tell
you
doctor
asked
craig
leaning
forward
expectantly
he
was
as
unprepared
for
the
answer
as
any
of
us
it
tells
me
that
a
higher
court
than
those
of
new
york
has
passed
judgment
on
this
astounding
criminal
the
aneurism
has
i
felt
a
soft
weight
fall
on
my
shoulder
the
morning
star
did
not
have
the
story
after
all
i
missed
the
greatest
scoop
of
my
life
seeing
eveline
bisbee
safely
to
her
home
after
she
had
recovered
from
the
shock
of
denny
exposure
and
punishment
iv
the
deadly
tube
for
heaven
sake
gregory
what
is
the
matter
asked
craig
kennedy
as
a
tall
nervous
man
stalked
into
our
apartment
one
evening
jameson
shake
hands
with
gregory
what
the
matter
doctor
surely
your
work
has
knocked
you
out
like
this
the
doctor
shook
hands
with
me
mechanically
his
hand
was
icy
the
blow
has
fallen
he
exclaimed
as
he
sank
limply
into
a
chair
and
tossed
an
evening
paper
over
to
kennedy
in
red
ink
on
the
first
page
in
the
little
square
headed
latest
news
kennedy
read
the
caption
society
woman
crippled
for
life
by
a
terrible
tragedy
was
revealed
in
the
suit
begun
today
continued
the
article
by
huntington
close
against
james
gregory
an
specialist
with
offices
at
madison
avenue
to
recover
damages
for
injuries
which
close
alleges
she
received
while
under
his
care
several
months
ago
she
began
a
course
of
treatment
to
remove
a
birthmark
on
her
neck
in
her
complaint
close
alleges
that
gregory
has
carelessly
caused
dermatitis
a
skin
disease
of
cancerous
nature
and
that
she
has
also
been
rendered
a
nervous
wreck
through
the
effects
of
the
rays
simultaneously
with
filing
the
suit
she
left
home
and
entered
a
private
hospital
close
is
one
of
the
most
popular
hostesses
in
the
smart
set
and
her
loss
will
be
keenly
what
am
i
to
do
kennedy
asked
the
doctor
imploringly
you
remember
i
told
you
the
other
day
about
this
case
that
there
was
something
queer
about
it
that
after
a
few
treatments
i
was
afraid
to
carry
on
any
more
and
refused
to
do
so
she
really
has
dermatitis
and
nervous
prostration
exactly
as
she
alleges
in
her
complaint
but
before
heaven
kennedy
i
ca
see
how
she
could
possibly
have
been
so
affected
by
the
few
treatments
i
gave
her
and
just
as
i
was
leaving
the
office
i
received
a
telephone
call
from
her
husband
attorney
lawrence
very
kindly
informing
me
that
the
case
would
be
pushed
to
the
limit
i
tell
you
it
looks
black
for
what
can
they
do
do
do
you
suppose
any
jury
is
going
to
take
enough
expert
testimony
to
outweigh
the
tragedy
of
a
beautiful
woman
do
why
they
can
ruin
me
even
if
i
get
a
verdict
of
acquittal
they
can
leave
me
with
a
reputation
for
carelessness
that
no
mere
court
decision
can
ever
gregory
you
can
rely
on
me
said
kennedy
anything
i
can
do
to
help
you
i
will
gladly
do
jameson
and
i
were
on
the
point
of
going
out
to
dinner
join
us
and
after
that
we
will
go
down
to
your
office
and
talk
things
you
are
really
too
kind
murmured
the
doctor
the
air
of
relief
that
was
written
on
his
face
was
pathetically
eloquent
now
not
a
word
about
the
case
till
we
have
had
dinner
commanded
craig
i
see
very
plainly
that
you
have
been
worrying
about
the
blow
for
a
long
time
well
it
has
fallen
the
neat
thing
to
do
is
to
look
over
the
situation
and
see
where
we
dinner
over
we
rode
in
the
subway
and
gregory
ushered
us
into
an
on
madison
avenue
where
he
had
a
very
handsome
suite
of
several
rooms
we
sat
own
in
his
to
discuss
the
affair
it
is
indeed
a
very
tragic
case
began
kennedy
almost
more
tragic
than
if
the
victim
had
been
killed
outright
huntington
close
is
or
rather
i
suppose
i
should
say
was
one
of
the
famous
beauties
of
the
city
from
what
the
paper
says
her
beauty
has
been
hopelessly
ruined
by
this
dermatitis
which
i
understand
doctor
is
practically
gregory
nodded
and
i
could
not
help
following
his
eyes
as
he
looked
at
his
own
rough
and
scarred
hands
also
continued
craig
with
his
eyes
half
closed
and
his
together
as
if
he
were
taking
a
mental
inventory
of
the
facts
in
the
case
her
nerves
are
so
shattered
that
she
will
be
years
in
recovering
if
she
ever
yes
said
the
doctor
simply
i
myself
for
instance
am
subject
to
the
most
unexpected
attacks
of
neuritis
but
of
course
i
am
under
the
influence
of
the
rays
fifty
or
sixty
times
a
day
while
she
had
only
a
few
treatments
at
intervals
of
many
now
on
the
other
hand
resumed
craig
i
know
you
gregory
very
well
only
the
other
day
before
any
of
this
came
out
you
told
me
the
whole
story
with
your
fears
as
to
the
outcome
i
know
that
that
lawyer
of
close
has
been
keeping
this
thing
hanging
over
your
head
for
a
long
time
and
i
also
know
that
you
are
one
of
the
most
careful
operators
in
the
city
if
this
suit
goes
against
you
one
of
the
most
brilliant
men
of
science
in
america
will
be
ruined
now
having
said
this
much
let
me
ask
you
to
describe
just
exactly
what
treatments
you
gave
the
doctor
led
us
into
his
room
adjoining
a
number
of
tubes
were
neatly
put
away
in
a
great
glass
case
and
at
one
end
of
the
room
was
an
with
an
apparatus
suspended
over
it
a
glance
at
the
room
showed
that
kennedy
praise
was
not
exaggerated
how
many
treatments
did
you
give
close
asked
kennedy
not
over
a
dozen
i
should
say
replied
gregory
i
have
a
record
of
them
and
the
dates
which
i
will
give
you
presently
certainly
they
were
not
numerous
enough
or
frequent
enough
to
have
caused
a
dermatitis
such
as
she
has
besides
look
here
i
have
an
apparatus
which
for
safety
to
the
patient
has
few
equals
in
the
country
this
big
bowl
which
is
placed
over
my
tube
when
in
use
cuts
off
the
rays
at
every
point
except
exactly
where
they
are
he
switched
on
the
electric
current
and
the
apparatus
began
to
sputter
the
pungent
odour
of
ozone
from
the
electric
discharge
filled
the
room
through
the
bowl
i
could
see
the
tube
inside
suffused
with
its
peculiar
light
divided
into
two
hemispheres
of
different
shades
that
i
knew
was
the
cathode
ray
not
the
for
the
itself
which
streams
outside
the
tube
is
invisible
to
the
human
eye
the
doctor
placed
in
our
hands
a
couple
of
fluoroscopes
an
apparatus
by
which
can
be
detected
it
consists
simply
of
a
closed
box
with
an
opening
to
which
the
eyes
are
placed
the
opposite
end
of
the
box
is
a
piece
of
board
coated
with
a
salt
such
as
cyanide
when
the
strikes
this
salt
it
makes
it
glow
or
fluoresce
and
objects
held
between
the
tube
and
the
fluoroscope
cast
shadows
according
to
the
density
of
the
parts
which
the
penetrate
with
the
bowl
removed
the
tube
sent
forth
its
wonderful
invisible
radiation
and
made
the
back
of
the
fluoroscope
glow
with
light
i
could
see
the
bones
of
my
fingers
as
i
held
them
up
between
the
tube
and
the
fluoroscope
but
with
the
bowl
in
position
over
the
tube
the
fluoroscope
was
simply
a
black
box
into
which
i
looked
and
saw
nothing
so
very
little
of
the
radiation
escaped
from
the
bowl
that
it
was
negligible
except
at
one
point
where
there
was
an
opening
in
the
bottom
of
the
bowl
to
allow
the
rays
to
pass
freely
through
exactly
on
the
spot
on
the
patient
where
they
were
to
be
used
the
dermatitis
they
say
has
appeared
all
over
her
body
particularly
on
her
head
and
shoulders
added
gregory
now
i
have
shown
you
my
apparatus
to
impress
on
you
how
really
impossible
it
would
have
been
for
her
to
contract
it
from
her
treatments
here
i
made
thousands
of
exposures
with
never
an
burn
before
except
to
myself
as
for
myself
i
as
careful
as
i
can
be
but
you
can
see
i
am
under
the
rays
very
often
while
the
patient
is
only
under
them
once
in
a
to
illustrate
his
care
he
pointed
out
to
us
a
cabinet
directly
back
of
the
lined
with
thick
sheets
of
lead
from
this
cabinet
he
conducted
most
of
his
treatments
as
far
as
possible
a
little
enabled
him
to
see
the
patient
and
the
apparatus
while
an
arrangement
of
mirrors
and
a
fluorescent
screen
enabled
him
to
see
exactly
what
the
were
disclosing
without
his
leaving
the
cabinet
i
can
think
of
no
more
perfect
protection
for
either
patient
or
operator
said
kennedy
admiringly
by
the
way
did
close
come
alone
no
the
first
time
close
came
with
her
after
that
she
came
with
her
french
the
next
day
we
paid
a
visit
to
close
herself
at
the
private
hospital
kennedy
had
been
casting
about
in
his
mind
for
an
excuse
to
see
her
and
i
had
suggested
that
we
go
as
reporters
from
the
star
fortunately
after
sending
up
my
card
on
which
i
had
written
craig
name
we
were
at
length
allowed
to
go
up
to
her
room
we
found
the
patient
reclining
in
an
easy
chair
swathed
in
bandages
a
wreck
of
her
former
self
i
felt
the
tragedy
keenly
all
that
social
position
and
beauty
had
meant
to
her
had
been
suddenly
blasted
you
will
pardon
my
presumption
began
craig
but
close
i
assure
you
that
i
am
actuated
by
the
best
of
motives
we
represent
the
new
york
star
is
it
terrible
enough
that
i
should
suffer
so
she
interrupted
but
must
the
newspapers
hound
me
too
i
beg
your
pardon
close
said
craig
but
you
must
be
aware
that
the
news
of
your
suit
of
gregory
has
now
become
public
property
i
could
stop
the
star
much
less
the
other
papers
from
talking
about
it
but
i
can
and
will
do
this
close
i
will
see
that
justice
is
done
to
you
and
all
others
concerned
believe
me
i
am
not
here
as
a
yellow
journalist
to
make
newspaper
copy
out
of
your
misfortune
i
am
here
to
get
at
the
truth
sympathetically
incidentally
i
may
be
able
to
render
you
a
service
you
can
render
me
no
service
except
to
expedite
the
suit
against
that
careless
doctor
i
hate
perhaps
said
craig
but
suppose
someone
else
should
be
proved
to
have
been
really
responsible
would
you
still
want
to
press
the
suit
and
let
the
guilty
person
escape
she
bit
her
lip
what
is
it
you
want
of
me
she
asked
i
merely
want
permission
to
visit
your
rooms
at
your
home
and
to
talk
with
your
maid
i
do
not
mean
to
spy
on
you
far
from
it
but
consider
close
if
i
should
be
able
to
get
at
the
bottom
of
this
thing
find
out
the
real
cause
of
your
misfortune
perhaps
show
that
you
are
the
victim
of
a
cruel
wrong
rather
than
of
carelessness
would
you
not
be
willing
to
let
me
go
ahead
i
am
frank
to
tell
you
that
i
suspect
there
is
more
to
this
affair
than
you
yourself
have
any
idea
no
you
are
mistaken
kennedy
i
know
the
cause
of
it
it
was
my
love
of
beauty
i
could
resist
the
temptation
to
get
rid
of
even
a
slight
defect
if
i
had
left
well
enough
alone
i
should
not
be
here
now
a
friend
recommended
gregory
to
my
husband
who
took
me
there
my
husband
wishes
me
to
remain
at
home
but
i
tell
him
i
feel
more
comfortable
here
in
the
hospital
i
shall
never
go
to
that
house
again
the
memory
of
the
torture
of
sleepless
nights
in
my
room
there
when
i
felt
my
good
looks
going
going
she
shuddered
is
such
that
i
can
never
forget
it
he
says
i
would
be
better
off
there
but
no
i
can
not
go
still
she
continued
wearily
there
can
be
no
harm
in
your
talking
to
my
kennedy
noted
attentively
what
she
was
saying
i
thank
you
close
he
replied
i
am
sure
you
will
not
regret
your
permission
would
you
be
so
kind
as
to
give
me
a
note
to
her
she
rang
dictated
a
short
note
to
a
nurse
signed
it
and
languidly
dismissed
us
i
do
know
that
i
ever
felt
as
depressed
as
i
did
after
that
interview
with
one
who
had
entered
a
living
death
to
ambition
for
while
craig
had
done
all
the
talking
i
had
absorbed
nothing
but
depression
i
vowed
that
if
gregory
or
anybody
else
was
responsible
i
would
do
my
share
toward
bringing
on
him
retribution
the
closes
lived
in
a
splendid
big
house
in
the
murray
hill
section
the
presentation
of
the
note
quickly
brought
close
maid
down
to
us
she
had
not
gone
to
the
hospital
because
close
had
considered
the
services
of
the
trained
nurses
quite
sufficient
yes
the
maid
had
noticed
how
her
mistress
had
been
failing
had
noticed
it
long
ago
in
fact
almost
at
the
time
when
she
had
begun
the
treatment
she
had
seemed
to
improve
once
when
she
went
away
for
a
few
days
but
that
was
at
the
start
and
directly
after
her
return
she
grew
worse
again
until
she
was
no
longer
herself
did
gregory
the
specialist
ever
attend
close
at
her
home
in
her
room
asked
craig
yes
once
twice
he
call
but
he
do
no
good
she
said
with
her
french
accent
did
close
have
other
callers
but
everyone
in
society
has
many
what
does
mean
frequent
callers
a
lawrence
for
instance
oh
yes
lawrence
when
close
was
at
home
yes
on
business
and
on
business
too
when
he
was
not
at
home
he
is
the
attorney
how
did
close
receive
him
he
is
the
attorney
marie
repeated
persistently
and
he
did
he
always
call
on
business
oh
yes
always
on
business
but
well
madame
she
was
a
very
beautiful
woman
perhaps
he
like
beautiful
women
eh
bien
that
was
before
the
doctor
gregory
treated
madame
after
the
doctor
treated
madame
lawrence
do
not
call
so
often
that
are
you
thoroughly
devoted
to
close
would
you
do
a
favour
for
her
asked
craig
sir
i
would
give
my
life
almost
for
madame
she
was
always
so
good
to
i
do
ask
you
to
give
your
life
for
her
marie
said
craig
but
you
can
do
her
a
great
service
a
very
great
i
will
do
said
craig
i
want
you
to
sleep
in
close
room
you
can
do
so
for
i
know
that
close
is
living
at
the
francis
club
until
his
wife
returns
from
the
sanitarium
morning
come
to
my
laboratory
craig
handed
her
his
card
and
i
will
tell
you
what
to
do
next
by
the
way
do
say
anything
to
anyone
in
the
house
about
it
and
keep
a
sharp
watch
on
the
actions
of
any
of
the
servants
who
may
go
into
close
well
said
craig
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
done
we
had
once
more
regained
the
street
and
were
walking
we
walked
in
silence
for
several
blocks
yes
mused
craig
there
is
something
you
can
do
after
all
walter
i
would
like
you
to
look
up
gregory
and
close
and
lawrence
i
already
know
something
about
them
but
you
can
find
out
a
good
deal
with
your
newspaper
connections
i
would
like
to
have
every
bit
of
scandal
that
has
ever
been
connected
with
them
or
with
close
or
he
added
significantly
with
any
other
woman
it
is
necessary
to
say
that
not
a
breath
of
it
must
be
published
i
found
a
good
deal
of
gossip
but
very
little
of
it
indeed
seemed
to
me
at
the
time
to
be
of
importance
dropping
in
at
the
francis
club
where
i
had
some
friends
i
casually
mentioned
the
troubles
of
the
huntington
closes
i
was
surprised
to
learn
that
close
spent
little
of
his
time
at
the
club
none
at
home
and
only
dropped
into
the
hospital
to
make
formal
inquiries
as
to
his
wife
condition
it
then
occurred
to
me
to
drop
into
the
office
of
society
squibs
whose
editor
i
had
long
known
the
editor
told
me
with
that
nameless
look
of
the
cynical
scandalmonger
that
if
i
wanted
to
learn
anything
about
huntington
close
i
had
best
watch
frances
tulkington
a
very
wealthy
western
divorcee
about
whom
the
smart
set
were
much
excited
particularly
those
whose
wealth
made
it
difficult
to
stand
the
pace
of
society
as
it
was
going
at
present
and
before
the
tragedy
said
the
editor
with
another
nameless
look
as
if
he
were
imparting
a
most
valuable
piece
of
gossip
it
was
the
talk
of
the
town
the
attention
that
close
lawyer
was
paying
to
close
but
to
her
credit
let
me
say
that
she
never
gave
us
a
chance
to
hint
at
anything
and
well
you
know
us
we
do
need
much
to
make
snappy
society
the
editor
then
waged
even
more
confidential
for
if
i
am
anything
at
all
i
am
a
good
listener
and
i
have
found
that
often
by
sitting
tight
and
listening
i
can
get
more
than
if
i
were
a
questioner
it
really
was
a
shame
the
way
that
man
lawrence
played
his
game
he
went
on
i
understand
that
it
was
he
who
introduced
close
to
they
were
both
his
clients
lawrence
had
fought
her
case
in
the
courts
when
she
sued
old
tulkington
for
divorce
and
a
handsome
settlement
he
got
for
her
too
they
say
his
fee
ran
up
into
the
hundred
thousands
contingent
you
know
i
do
know
what
his
game
was
here
he
lowered
his
voice
to
a
whisper
but
they
say
close
owes
him
a
good
deal
of
money
you
can
figure
it
out
for
yourself
as
you
like
now
told
you
all
i
know
come
in
again
jameson
when
you
want
some
more
scandal
and
remember
me
to
the
boys
down
on
the
the
following
day
the
maid
visited
kennedy
at
his
laboratory
while
i
was
reporting
to
him
on
the
result
of
my
investigations
she
looked
worn
and
haggard
she
had
spent
a
sleepless
night
and
begged
that
kennedy
would
not
ask
her
to
repeat
the
experiment
i
can
promise
you
marie
he
said
that
you
will
rest
better
but
you
must
spend
one
more
night
in
close
room
by
the
way
can
you
arrange
for
me
to
go
through
the
room
this
morning
when
you
go
back
marie
said
she
could
and
an
hour
or
so
later
craig
and
i
quietly
slipped
into
the
close
residence
under
her
guidance
he
was
carrying
something
that
looked
like
a
miniature
barrel
and
i
had
another
package
which
he
had
given
me
both
carefully
wrapped
up
the
butler
eyed
us
suspiciously
but
marie
spoke
a
few
words
to
him
and
i
think
showed
him
close
note
anyhow
he
said
nothing
within
the
room
that
the
unfortunate
woman
had
occupied
kennedy
took
the
coverings
off
the
packages
it
was
nothing
but
a
portable
electric
vacuum
cleaner
which
he
quickly
attached
and
set
running
up
and
down
the
floor
around
and
under
the
bed
he
pushed
the
cleaner
he
used
the
various
attachments
to
clean
the
curtains
the
walls
and
even
the
furniture
particularly
did
he
pay
attention
to
the
base
board
on
the
wall
back
of
the
bed
then
he
carefully
removed
the
dust
from
the
cleaner
and
sealed
it
up
in
a
leaden
box
he
was
about
to
detach
and
pack
up
the
cleaner
when
another
idea
seemed
to
occur
to
him
might
as
well
make
a
thorough
job
of
it
walter
he
said
adjusting
the
apparatus
again
i
cleaned
everything
but
the
mattress
and
the
brass
bars
behind
the
mattress
on
the
bed
now
i
tackle
them
i
think
we
ought
to
go
into
the
business
more
money
in
it
than
in
being
a
detective
i
the
cleaner
was
run
over
and
under
the
mattress
and
along
every
crack
and
cranny
of
the
brass
bed
this
done
and
this
dust
also
carefully
stowed
away
we
departed
very
much
to
the
mystification
of
marie
and
i
could
not
help
feeling
of
other
eyes
that
peered
in
through
keyholes
or
cracks
in
doors
at
any
rate
said
kennedy
exultingly
i
think
we
have
stolen
a
march
on
them
i
do
believe
they
were
prepared
for
this
not
at
least
at
this
stage
in
the
game
do
ask
me
any
questions
walter
then
you
will
have
no
secrets
to
keep
if
anyone
should
try
to
pry
them
loose
only
remember
that
this
man
lawrence
is
a
shrewd
the
next
day
marie
came
looking
even
more
careworn
than
before
what
the
matter
mademoiselle
asked
craig
did
you
pass
a
better
night
oh
mon
dieu
i
rest
well
yes
but
this
morning
while
i
am
at
breakfast
close
send
for
me
he
say
that
i
am
discharged
some
servant
tell
of
your
visit
and
he
verry
and
now
what
is
to
become
of
me
will
madame
his
wife
give
a
recommendation
now
walter
we
have
been
discovered
exclaimed
craig
with
considerable
vexation
then
he
remembered
the
poor
girl
who
had
been
an
involuntary
sacrifice
to
our
investigation
turning
to
her
he
said
marie
i
know
several
very
good
families
and
i
am
sure
you
will
not
suffer
for
what
you
have
done
by
being
faithful
to
your
mistress
only
be
patient
a
few
days
go
live
with
some
of
your
folks
i
will
see
that
you
are
placed
the
girl
was
profuse
in
her
thanks
as
she
dried
her
tears
and
departed
i
had
anticipated
having
my
hand
forced
so
soon
said
craig
after
she
had
gone
leaving
her
address
however
we
are
on
the
right
track
what
was
it
that
you
were
going
to
tell
me
when
marie
came
in
something
that
may
be
very
important
craig
i
said
though
i
understand
it
myself
pressure
is
being
brought
to
bear
on
the
star
to
keep
this
thing
out
of
the
papers
or
at
least
to
minimise
i
not
surprised
commented
craig
what
do
you
mean
by
pressure
being
brought
why
close
lawyer
lawrence
called
up
the
editor
this
morning
i
do
suppose
that
you
know
but
he
has
some
connection
with
the
interests
which
control
the
star
and
said
that
the
activity
of
one
of
the
reporters
from
the
star
jameson
by
name
was
very
distasteful
to
close
and
that
this
reporter
was
employing
a
man
named
kennedy
to
assist
him
i
do
understand
it
craig
i
confessed
but
here
one
day
they
give
the
news
to
the
papers
and
two
days
later
they
almost
threaten
us
with
suit
if
we
do
stop
publishing
it
is
perplexing
said
craig
with
the
air
of
one
who
was
not
a
bit
perplexed
but
rather
enlightened
he
pulled
down
the
district
telegraph
messenger
lever
three
times
and
we
sat
in
silence
for
a
while
however
he
resumed
i
shall
be
ready
for
them
i
said
nothing
several
minutes
elapsed
then
the
messenger
rapped
on
the
door
i
want
these
two
notes
delivered
right
away
said
craig
to
the
boy
here
a
quarter
for
you
now
mind
you
do
get
interested
in
a
detective
story
and
forget
the
notes
if
you
are
back
here
quickly
with
the
receipts
i
give
you
another
quarter
now
scurry
then
after
the
boy
had
gone
he
said
casually
to
me
two
notes
to
close
and
gregory
asking
them
to
be
present
with
their
attorneys
close
will
bring
lawrence
and
gregory
will
bring
a
young
lawyer
named
asche
a
very
clever
fellow
the
notes
are
so
worded
that
they
can
hardly
refuse
the
meanwhile
i
carried
out
an
assignment
for
the
star
and
telephoned
my
story
in
so
as
to
be
sure
of
being
with
craig
at
the
crucial
moment
for
i
was
thoroughly
curious
about
his
next
move
in
the
game
i
found
him
still
in
his
laboratory
attaching
two
coils
of
thin
wire
to
the
connections
on
the
outside
of
a
little
black
box
what
that
i
asked
eyeing
the
sinister
looking
little
box
suspiciously
an
infernal
machine
you
not
going
to
blow
the
culprit
into
eternity
i
never
mind
what
it
is
walter
you
find
that
out
in
due
time
it
may
or
it
may
not
be
an
infernal
machine
of
a
different
sort
than
any
you
have
probably
ever
heard
of
the
less
you
know
now
the
less
likely
you
are
to
give
anything
away
by
a
look
or
an
act
come
now
make
yourself
useful
as
well
as
ornamental
take
these
wires
and
lay
them
in
the
cracks
of
the
floor
and
be
careful
not
to
let
them
show
a
little
dust
over
them
will
conceal
them
craig
now
placed
the
black
box
back
of
one
of
the
chairs
well
down
toward
the
floor
where
it
could
hardly
have
been
perceived
unless
one
were
suspecting
something
of
the
sort
while
he
was
doing
so
i
ran
the
wires
across
the
floor
and
around
the
edge
of
the
room
to
the
door
there
he
said
taking
the
wires
from
me
now
i
complete
the
job
by
carrying
them
into
the
next
room
and
while
i
doing
it
go
over
the
wires
again
and
make
sure
they
are
absolutely
that
night
six
men
gathered
in
kennedy
laboratory
in
my
utter
ignorance
of
what
was
about
to
happen
i
was
perfectly
calm
and
so
were
all
the
rest
except
gregory
he
was
easily
the
most
nervous
of
us
all
though
his
lawyer
asche
tried
repeatedly
to
reassure
him
mr
close
began
kennedy
if
you
and
lawrence
will
sit
over
here
on
this
side
of
the
room
while
gregory
and
asche
sit
on
the
opposite
side
with
jameson
in
the
middle
i
think
both
of
you
opposing
parties
will
be
better
suited
for
i
apprehend
that
at
various
stages
in
what
i
am
about
to
say
both
you
close
and
you
gregory
will
want
to
consult
your
attorneys
that
of
course
would
be
embarrassing
if
not
impossible
should
you
be
sitting
near
each
other
now
if
we
are
ready
i
shall
kennedy
placed
a
small
leaden
casket
on
the
table
of
his
lecture
hall
in
this
casket
he
commenced
solemnly
there
is
a
certain
substance
which
i
have
recovered
from
the
dust
swept
up
by
a
vacuum
cleaner
in
the
room
of
one
could
feel
the
very
air
of
the
room
surcharged
with
excitement
craig
drew
on
a
pair
of
gloves
and
carefully
opened
the
casket
with
his
thumb
and
forefinger
he
lifted
out
a
glass
tube
and
held
it
gingerly
at
arm
length
my
eyes
were
riveted
on
it
for
the
bottom
of
the
tube
glowed
with
a
dazzling
point
of
light
both
gregory
and
his
attorney
and
close
and
lawrence
whispered
to
each
other
when
the
tube
was
displayed
as
indeed
they
did
throughout
the
whole
exhibition
of
kennedy
evidence
no
infernal
machine
was
ever
more
subtle
said
craig
than
the
tube
which
i
hold
in
my
hand
the
imagination
of
the
most
sensational
writer
of
fiction
might
well
be
thrilled
with
the
mysteries
of
this
fatal
tube
and
its
power
to
work
fearful
deeds
a
larger
quantity
of
this
substance
in
the
tube
would
produce
on
me
as
i
now
hold
it
incurable
burns
just
as
it
did
on
its
discoverer
before
his
death
a
smaller
amount
of
course
would
not
act
so
quickly
the
amount
in
this
tube
if
distributed
about
would
produce
the
burns
inevitably
providing
i
remained
near
enough
for
a
craig
paused
a
moment
to
emphasise
his
remarks
here
in
my
hand
gentlemen
i
hold
the
price
of
a
woman
he
stopped
again
for
several
moments
then
resumed
and
now
having
shown
it
to
you
for
my
own
safety
i
will
place
it
back
in
its
leaden
drawing
off
his
gloves
he
proceeded
i
have
found
out
by
a
cablegram
that
seven
weeks
ago
an
order
for
one
hundred
milligrams
of
radium
bromide
at
dollars
a
milligram
from
a
certain
person
in
america
was
filled
by
a
corporation
dealing
in
this
kennedy
said
this
with
measured
words
and
i
felt
a
thrill
run
through
me
as
he
developed
his
case
at
that
same
time
close
began
a
series
of
treatments
with
an
specialist
in
new
york
pursued
kennedy
now
it
is
not
generally
known
outside
scientific
circles
but
the
fact
is
that
in
their
physiological
effects
the
and
radium
are
quite
one
and
the
same
radium
possesses
this
advantage
however
that
no
elaborate
apparatus
is
necessary
for
its
use
and
in
addition
the
emanation
from
radium
is
steady
and
constant
whereas
the
at
best
varies
slightly
with
changing
conditions
of
the
current
and
vacuum
in
the
tube
still
the
effects
on
the
body
are
much
the
same
a
few
days
before
this
order
was
placed
i
recall
the
following
despatch
which
appeared
in
the
new
york
papers
i
will
read
it
belgium
what
is
believed
to
be
the
first
criminal
case
in
which
radium
figures
as
a
agent
is
engaging
public
attention
at
this
university
town
a
wealthy
old
bachelor
pailin
by
name
was
found
dead
in
his
flat
a
stroke
of
apoplexy
was
at
first
believed
to
have
caused
his
death
but
a
close
examination
revealed
a
curious
discolouration
of
his
skin
a
specialist
called
in
to
view
the
body
gave
as
his
opinion
that
the
old
man
had
been
exposed
for
a
long
time
to
the
emanations
of
or
radium
the
police
theory
is
that
pailin
was
done
to
death
by
a
systematic
application
of
either
or
radium
by
a
student
in
the
university
who
roomed
next
to
him
the
student
has
disappeared
now
here
i
believe
was
the
suggestion
which
this
american
criminal
followed
for
i
cut
it
out
of
the
paper
rather
expecting
sooner
or
later
that
some
clever
person
would
act
on
it
i
have
thoroughly
examined
the
room
of
close
she
herself
told
me
she
never
wanted
to
return
to
it
that
her
memory
of
sleepless
nights
in
it
was
too
vivid
that
served
to
fix
the
impression
that
i
had
already
formed
from
reading
this
clipping
either
the
or
radium
had
caused
her
dermatitis
and
nervousness
which
was
it
i
wished
to
be
sure
that
i
would
make
no
mistake
of
course
i
knew
it
was
useless
to
look
for
an
machine
in
or
near
close
room
such
a
thing
could
never
have
been
concealed
the
alternative
radium
ah
that
was
different
i
determined
on
an
experiment
close
maid
was
prevailed
on
to
sleep
in
her
mistress
room
of
course
radiations
of
brief
duration
would
do
her
no
permanent
harm
although
they
would
produce
their
effect
nevertheless
in
one
night
the
maid
became
extremely
nervous
if
she
had
stayed
under
them
several
nights
no
doubt
the
beginning
of
a
dermatitis
would
have
affected
her
if
not
more
serious
trouble
a
systematic
application
covering
weeks
and
months
might
in
the
end
even
have
led
to
death
the
next
day
i
managed
as
i
have
said
to
go
over
the
room
thoroughly
with
a
vacuum
cleaner
a
new
one
of
my
own
which
i
had
bought
myself
but
tests
of
the
dust
which
i
got
from
the
floors
curtains
and
furniture
showed
nothing
at
all
as
a
last
thought
i
had
however
cleaned
the
mattress
of
the
bed
and
the
cracks
and
crevices
in
the
brass
bars
tests
of
that
dust
showed
it
to
be
extremely
radioactive
i
had
the
dust
dissolved
by
a
chemist
who
understands
that
sort
of
thing
recrystallised
and
the
radium
salts
were
extracted
from
the
refuse
thus
i
found
that
i
had
recovered
all
but
a
very
few
milligrams
of
the
radium
that
had
been
originally
purchased
in
london
here
it
is
in
this
deadly
tube
in
the
leaden
casket
it
is
needless
to
add
that
the
night
after
i
had
cleaned
out
this
deadly
element
the
maid
slept
the
sleep
of
the
just
and
would
have
been
all
right
when
next
i
saw
her
but
for
the
interference
of
the
unjust
on
whom
i
had
stolen
a
craig
paused
while
the
lawyers
whispered
again
to
their
clients
then
he
continued
now
three
persons
in
this
room
had
an
opportunity
to
secrete
the
contents
of
this
deadly
tube
in
the
crevices
of
the
metal
work
of
close
bed
one
of
these
persons
must
have
placed
an
order
through
a
confidential
agent
in
london
to
purchase
the
radium
from
the
english
radium
corporation
one
of
these
persons
had
a
compelling
motive
something
to
gain
by
using
this
deadly
element
the
radium
in
this
tube
in
the
casket
was
secreted
as
i
have
said
in
the
metal
work
of
close
bed
not
in
large
enough
quantities
to
be
immediately
fatal
but
mixed
with
dust
so
as
to
produce
the
result
more
slowly
but
no
less
surely
and
thus
avoid
suspicion
at
the
same
time
close
was
persuaded
i
will
not
say
by
whom
through
her
natural
pride
to
take
a
course
of
treatment
for
a
slight
defect
that
would
further
serve
to
divert
suspicion
the
fact
is
that
a
more
horrible
plot
could
hardly
have
been
planned
or
executed
this
person
sought
to
ruin
her
beauty
to
gain
a
most
selfish
and
despicable
again
craig
paused
to
let
his
words
sink
into
our
minds
now
i
wish
to
state
that
anything
you
gentlemen
may
say
will
be
used
against
you
that
is
why
i
have
asked
you
to
bring
your
attorneys
you
may
consult
with
them
of
course
while
i
am
getting
ready
my
next
as
kennedy
had
developed
his
points
in
the
case
i
had
been
more
and
more
amazed
but
i
had
not
failed
to
notice
how
keenly
lawrence
was
following
him
with
half
a
sneer
on
his
astute
face
lawrence
drawled
i
can
not
see
that
you
have
accomplished
anything
by
this
rather
extraordinary
summoning
of
us
to
your
laboratory
the
evidence
is
just
as
black
against
gregory
as
before
you
may
think
you
clever
kennedy
but
on
the
very
statement
of
facts
as
you
have
brought
them
out
there
is
plenty
of
circumstantial
evidence
against
gregory
more
than
there
was
before
as
for
anyone
else
in
the
room
i
ca
see
that
you
have
anything
on
us
unless
perhaps
this
new
evidence
you
speak
of
may
implicate
asche
or
jameson
he
added
including
me
in
a
wave
of
his
hand
as
if
he
were
already
addressing
a
jury
it
my
opinion
that
twelve
of
our
peers
would
be
quite
as
likely
to
bring
in
a
verdict
of
guilty
against
them
as
against
anyone
else
even
remotely
connected
with
this
case
except
gregory
no
you
have
to
do
better
than
this
in
your
next
case
if
you
expect
to
maintain
that
reputation
of
yours
for
being
a
professor
of
criminal
as
for
close
taking
his
cue
from
his
attorney
he
scornfully
added
i
came
to
find
out
some
new
evidence
against
the
wretch
who
wrecked
the
beauty
of
my
wife
all
i
got
is
a
tiresome
lecture
on
and
radium
i
suppose
what
you
say
is
true
well
it
only
bears
out
what
i
thought
before
gregory
treated
my
wife
at
home
after
he
saw
the
damage
his
office
treatments
had
done
i
guess
he
was
capable
of
making
a
complete
job
out
of
it
covering
up
his
carelessness
by
getting
rid
of
the
woman
who
was
such
a
damning
piece
of
evidence
against
his
professional
never
a
shade
passed
craig
face
as
he
listened
to
this
tirade
excuse
me
a
moment
was
all
he
said
opening
the
door
to
leave
the
room
i
have
just
one
more
fact
to
disclose
i
will
be
back
kennedy
was
gone
several
minutes
during
which
close
and
lawrence
fell
to
whispering
behind
their
hands
with
the
assurance
of
those
who
believed
that
this
was
only
kennedy
method
of
admitting
a
defeat
gregory
and
asche
exchanged
a
few
words
similarly
and
it
was
plain
that
asche
was
endeavouring
to
put
a
better
interpretation
on
something
than
gregory
himself
dared
hope
as
kennedy
close
was
buttoning
up
his
coat
preparatory
to
leaving
and
lawrence
was
lighting
a
fresh
cigar
in
his
hand
kennedy
held
a
notebook
my
stenographer
writes
a
very
legible
shorthand
at
least
i
find
it
so
from
long
practice
i
suppose
as
i
glance
over
her
notes
i
find
many
facts
which
will
interest
you
later
at
the
trial
but
ah
here
at
the
end
let
me
read
he
very
clever
but
he
has
nothing
against
me
has
he
not
unless
he
can
produce
the
agent
who
bought
the
radium
for
you
he
ca
do
that
no
one
could
ever
have
recognised
you
on
your
flying
trip
to
london
disguised
as
a
diamond
merchant
who
had
just
learned
that
he
could
make
his
faulty
diamonds
good
by
applications
of
radium
and
who
wanted
a
good
stock
of
the
stuff
we
have
to
drop
the
suit
against
gregory
after
all
in
spite
of
what
i
said
that
part
is
hopelessly
spoiled
i
suppose
so
oh
well
i
free
now
she
can
hardly
help
but
consent
to
a
divorce
now
and
a
quiet
settlement
she
brought
it
on
herself
we
tried
every
other
way
to
do
it
but
she
she
was
too
good
to
fall
into
it
she
forced
us
to
it
you
get
a
good
divorce
now
but
ca
we
shut
up
this
man
kennedy
even
if
he
ca
prove
anything
against
us
the
mere
rumour
of
such
a
thing
coming
to
the
ears
of
tulkington
would
be
unpleasant
as
far
as
you
like
lawrence
you
know
what
the
marriage
will
mean
to
me
it
will
settle
my
debts
to
you
and
all
the
rest
see
what
i
can
do
close
he
be
back
in
a
moment
close
face
was
livid
it
a
pack
of
lies
he
shouted
advancing
toward
kennedy
a
pack
of
lies
you
are
a
fakir
and
a
blackmailer
have
you
in
jail
for
this
by
god
and
you
too
one
moment
please
said
kennedy
calmly
mr
lawrence
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
reach
behind
your
chair
what
do
you
find
lawrence
lifted
up
the
plain
black
box
and
with
it
he
pulled
up
the
wires
which
i
had
so
carefully
concealed
in
the
cracks
of
the
floor
that
said
kennedy
is
a
little
instrument
called
the
microphone
its
chief
merit
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
will
magnify
a
sound
sixteen
hundred
times
and
carry
it
to
any
given
point
where
you
wish
to
place
the
receiver
originally
this
device
was
invented
for
the
aid
of
the
deaf
but
i
see
no
reason
why
it
should
not
be
used
to
aid
the
law
one
need
eavesdrop
at
the
keyhole
with
this
little
instrument
about
inside
that
box
there
is
nothing
but
a
series
of
plugs
from
which
wires
much
finer
than
a
thread
are
stretched
taut
yet
a
fly
walking
near
it
will
make
a
noise
as
loud
as
a
if
the
microphone
is
placed
in
any
part
of
the
room
especially
if
near
the
persons
talking
even
if
they
are
talking
in
a
whisper
a
whisper
such
as
occurred
several
times
during
the
evening
and
particularly
while
i
was
in
the
next
room
getting
the
notes
made
by
my
stenographer
a
whisper
i
say
is
like
shouting
your
guilt
from
the
housetops
you
two
men
close
and
lawrence
may
consider
yourselves
under
arrest
for
conspiracy
and
whatever
other
indictments
will
lie
against
such
creatures
as
you
the
police
will
be
here
in
a
moment
no
close
violence
wo
do
now
the
doors
are
locked
and
see
we
are
four
to
the
seismograph
adventure
dr
james
hanson
coroner
physician
criminal
courts
building
read
craig
kennedy
as
he
held
a
visitor
card
in
his
hand
then
to
the
visitor
he
added
take
a
chair
the
physician
thanked
him
and
sat
down
professor
kennedy
he
began
i
have
been
referred
to
you
by
inspector
of
the
detective
bureau
it
may
seem
an
impertinence
for
a
city
official
to
call
on
you
for
assistance
but
well
you
see
i
completely
floored
i
think
too
that
the
case
will
interest
you
it
the
vandam
if
hanson
had
suddenly
turned
on
the
current
of
an
induction
coil
and
i
had
been
holding
the
handles
i
do
think
the
thrill
i
received
could
have
been
any
more
sudden
the
vandam
case
was
the
sensation
of
the
moment
a
triple
puzzle
as
both
kennedy
and
myself
had
agreed
was
it
suicide
murder
or
sudden
death
every
theory
so
far
had
proved
unsatisfactory
i
have
read
only
what
the
newspapers
have
published
replied
craig
to
the
doctor
look
of
inquiry
you
see
my
friend
jameson
here
is
on
the
staff
of
the
star
and
we
are
in
the
habit
of
discussing
these
very
glad
to
meet
you
jameson
exclaimed
hanson
at
the
implied
introduction
the
relations
between
my
office
and
your
paper
have
always
been
very
satisfactory
i
can
assure
thank
you
doctor
depend
on
me
to
keep
them
so
i
replied
shaking
his
proffered
hand
now
as
to
the
case
continued
the
doctor
slowly
here
is
a
beautiful
woman
in
the
prime
of
life
the
wife
of
a
very
wealthy
retired
banker
considerably
older
than
herself
perhaps
nearly
seventy
of
very
fine
family
of
course
you
have
read
it
all
but
let
me
sketch
it
so
you
will
look
at
it
from
my
point
of
view
this
woman
apparently
in
good
health
with
every
luxury
money
can
buy
is
certain
within
a
very
few
years
from
her
dower
rights
to
be
numbered
among
the
richest
women
in
america
yet
she
is
discovered
in
the
middle
of
the
night
by
her
maid
seated
at
the
table
in
the
library
of
her
home
unconscious
she
never
regains
consciousness
but
dies
the
following
morning
the
coroner
is
called
in
and
as
his
physician
i
must
advise
him
the
family
physician
has
pronounced
it
due
to
natural
causes
the
uremic
coma
of
latent
kidney
trouble
some
of
the
newspapers
i
think
the
star
among
them
have
hinted
at
suicide
and
then
there
are
others
who
have
flatly
asserted
it
was
the
coroner
physician
paused
to
see
if
we
were
following
him
needless
to
say
kennedy
was
ahead
of
him
have
you
any
facts
in
your
possession
which
have
not
been
given
to
the
public
yet
asked
craig
i
coming
to
that
in
a
moment
replied
hanson
let
me
sketch
the
case
first
henry
vandam
had
become
well
very
eccentric
in
his
old
age
we
will
say
among
his
eccentricities
none
seems
to
have
impressed
the
newspapers
more
than
his
devotion
to
a
medium
and
her
manager
may
popper
and
howard
farrington
now
of
course
the
case
does
not
go
into
the
truth
or
falsity
of
spiritualism
you
understand
you
have
your
opinion
and
i
have
mine
what
this
aspect
of
the
case
involves
is
merely
the
character
of
the
medium
and
her
manager
you
know
of
course
that
henry
vandam
is
completely
under
their
he
paused
again
to
emphasise
the
point
you
asked
me
if
i
was
in
possession
of
any
facts
which
have
not
been
given
to
the
press
yes
i
am
and
just
there
lies
the
trouble
they
are
so
very
conflicting
as
to
be
almost
worse
than
useless
as
far
as
i
can
see
we
found
near
the
unfortunate
woman
a
small
with
three
capsules
still
in
it
it
was
labelled
before
retiring
and
bore
the
name
of
a
certain
druggist
and
the
initials
now
i
am
convinced
that
the
initials
are
merely
a
blind
and
do
not
give
any
clue
the
druggist
says
that
a
maid
from
the
vandam
house
brought
in
the
prescription
which
of
course
he
filled
it
is
a
harmless
enough
prescription
contains
among
other
things
four
and
a
half
grains
of
quinine
and
of
a
grain
of
morphine
six
capsules
were
prepared
altogether
now
of
course
my
first
thought
was
that
she
might
have
taken
several
capsules
at
once
and
that
it
was
a
case
of
accidental
morphine
poisoning
or
it
might
even
be
suicide
but
it
can
not
be
either
to
my
mind
for
only
three
of
the
six
capsules
are
gone
no
doubt
also
you
are
acquainted
with
the
fact
that
the
one
invariable
symptom
of
morphine
poisoning
is
the
contraction
of
the
pupils
of
the
eyes
to
a
often
so
that
they
are
unrecognisable
moreover
the
pupils
are
symmetrically
contracted
and
this
symptom
is
the
one
invariably
present
in
coma
from
morphine
poisoning
and
distinguishes
it
from
all
other
forms
of
death
on
the
other
hand
in
the
coma
of
kidney
disease
one
pupil
is
dilated
and
the
other
contracted
they
are
unsymmetrical
but
in
this
case
both
the
pupils
are
normal
or
only
a
very
little
dilated
and
they
are
symmetrical
so
far
we
have
been
able
to
find
no
other
poison
than
the
slight
traces
of
morphine
remaining
in
the
stomach
after
so
many
hours
i
think
you
are
enough
of
a
chemist
to
know
that
no
doctor
would
dare
go
on
the
stand
and
swear
to
death
from
morphine
poisoning
in
the
face
of
such
evidence
against
him
the
veriest
tyro
of
an
expert
toxicologist
could
too
easily
confute
kennedy
nodded
have
you
the
and
the
prescription
i
have
replied
hanson
placing
them
on
the
table
kennedy
scrutinised
them
sharply
i
shall
need
these
he
said
of
course
you
understand
i
will
take
very
good
care
of
them
is
there
anything
else
of
importance
really
i
do
know
said
the
physician
dubiously
it
rather
out
of
my
province
but
perhaps
you
would
think
it
important
it
mighty
uncanny
anyhow
henry
vandam
as
you
doubtless
know
was
much
more
deeply
interested
in
the
work
of
this
medium
than
was
his
wife
perhaps
vandam
was
a
bit
jealous
i
do
know
but
she
too
had
an
interest
in
spiritualism
though
he
was
much
more
deeply
influenced
by
popper
than
she
here
the
strange
part
of
it
the
old
man
believes
so
thoroughly
in
rappings
and
materialisations
that
he
constantly
keeps
a
notebook
in
his
pocket
in
which
he
records
all
the
materialisations
he
thinks
he
sees
and
the
rappings
he
hears
along
with
the
time
and
place
now
it
so
happened
that
on
the
night
vandam
was
taken
ill
he
had
retired
i
believe
in
another
part
of
the
house
where
he
has
a
regular
according
to
his
story
he
was
awakened
from
a
profound
sleep
by
a
series
of
rappings
as
was
his
custom
he
noted
the
time
at
which
they
occurred
something
made
him
uneasy
and
he
said
to
his
at
least
this
is
his
story
is
it
about
mary
three
raps
answered
the
usual
code
is
the
matter
is
she
ill
the
three
answering
raps
were
so
vigorous
that
he
sprang
out
of
bed
and
called
for
his
wife
maid
the
maid
replied
that
vandam
had
not
gone
to
bed
yet
but
that
there
was
a
light
in
the
library
and
she
would
go
to
her
mistress
immediately
the
next
moment
the
house
was
awakened
by
the
screams
of
the
maid
calling
for
help
that
vandam
was
dying
that
was
three
nights
ago
on
each
of
the
two
succeeding
nights
henry
vandam
says
he
has
been
awakened
at
precisely
the
same
hour
by
a
rapping
and
on
each
night
his
has
given
him
a
message
from
his
dead
wife
as
a
man
of
science
i
attribute
the
whole
thing
to
an
overwrought
imagination
the
original
rappings
may
have
been
a
mere
coincidence
with
the
fact
of
the
condition
of
vandam
however
i
give
this
to
you
for
what
it
is
craig
said
nothing
but
as
was
his
habit
shaded
his
eyes
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
resting
his
elbows
on
the
arms
of
his
chair
i
suppose
he
said
you
can
give
me
the
necessary
authority
to
enter
the
vandam
house
and
look
at
the
scene
of
these
happenings
certainly
assented
the
physician
but
you
will
find
it
a
queer
place
there
are
spirit
paintings
and
spirit
photographs
in
every
room
and
vandam
own
part
of
the
house
well
it
creepy
that
all
i
can
and
also
i
suppose
you
have
performed
an
autopsy
on
the
body
and
will
allow
me
to
drop
into
your
laboratory
morning
and
satisfy
myself
on
this
morphine
point
certainly
replied
the
coroner
physician
at
any
time
you
at
ten
sharp
then
i
shall
be
there
said
craig
it
is
now
do
you
think
i
can
see
vandam
what
time
do
these
rappings
occur
why
yes
you
surely
will
be
able
to
see
him
he
stirred
from
the
house
since
his
wife
died
he
told
me
he
momentarily
expected
messages
from
her
direct
when
she
had
got
strong
enough
in
her
new
world
i
believe
they
had
some
kind
of
a
compact
to
that
effect
the
rappings
come
at
ah
then
i
shall
have
plenty
of
time
to
run
over
to
my
laboratory
before
seeing
vandam
and
get
some
apparatus
i
have
in
mind
no
doctor
you
need
bother
to
go
with
me
just
give
me
a
card
of
introduction
i
see
you
at
ten
oh
by
the
way
do
give
out
any
of
the
facts
you
have
told
jameson
said
craig
when
we
were
walking
rapidly
over
toward
the
university
this
promises
to
be
an
uncommonly
difficult
as
i
view
it
now
i
said
i
have
suspicions
of
everybody
concerned
in
it
even
the
view
of
the
star
that
it
is
a
case
of
suicide
due
to
overwrought
nerves
may
explain
it
might
even
be
a
natural
death
craig
added
and
that
would
make
it
a
greater
mystery
than
ever
a
case
for
psychical
research
one
thing
that
i
am
going
to
do
will
tell
me
much
at
the
laboratory
he
unlocked
a
glass
case
and
took
out
a
little
instrument
which
looked
like
two
horizontal
pendulums
suspended
by
fine
wires
there
was
a
large
magnet
near
each
pendulum
and
the
end
of
each
pendulum
bore
a
needle
which
touched
a
circular
drum
driven
by
craig
fussed
with
and
adjusted
the
apparatus
while
i
said
nothing
for
i
had
long
ago
learned
that
in
applying
a
new
apparatus
to
doing
old
things
craig
was
as
dumb
as
an
oyster
until
his
work
was
crowned
with
success
we
had
no
trouble
in
getting
in
to
see
vandam
in
his
his
face
was
familiar
to
me
for
i
had
seen
him
in
public
a
number
of
times
but
it
looked
strangely
altered
he
was
nervous
and
showed
his
age
very
perceptibly
it
was
as
the
coroner
physician
had
said
the
house
was
littered
with
reminders
of
the
cult
books
papers
curious
daubs
of
paintings
handsomely
framed
and
photographs
hazy
overexposures
i
should
have
called
them
but
vandam
took
great
pride
in
them
and
kennedy
quite
won
him
over
by
his
admiration
for
them
they
talked
about
the
rappings
and
the
old
man
explained
where
and
when
they
occurred
they
proceeded
from
a
little
cabinet
or
closet
at
one
end
of
the
room
it
was
evident
that
he
was
a
thorough
believer
in
them
and
in
the
messages
they
conveyed
craig
carefully
noted
everything
about
the
room
and
then
fell
to
admiring
the
spirit
photographs
if
such
they
might
be
called
the
best
of
all
i
do
not
display
they
are
too
precious
said
the
old
man
would
you
like
to
see
them
craig
assented
eagerly
and
vandam
left
us
for
a
moment
to
get
them
in
an
instant
craig
had
entered
the
cabinet
and
in
a
dark
corner
on
the
floor
he
deposited
the
mechanism
he
had
brought
from
the
laboratory
then
he
resumed
his
seat
shutting
the
box
in
which
he
had
brought
the
mechanism
so
that
it
would
not
appear
that
he
had
left
anything
about
the
room
artfully
he
led
the
conversation
along
lines
that
interested
the
old
man
until
he
seemed
to
forget
the
hour
not
so
craig
he
knew
it
was
nearing
twelve
the
more
they
talked
the
more
uncanny
did
this
house
and
room
of
spirits
seem
to
me
in
fact
i
was
rapidly
reaching
the
point
where
i
could
have
sworn
that
once
or
twice
something
incorporeal
brushed
by
me
i
know
now
that
it
was
purely
imagination
but
it
shows
what
tricks
the
imagination
can
play
on
us
rap
rap
rap
rap
rap
five
times
came
a
curiously
hollow
noise
from
the
cabinet
if
it
had
been
possible
i
should
certainly
have
fled
it
was
so
sudden
and
unexpected
the
hall
clock
downstairs
struck
the
in
those
chimes
written
by
handel
for
paul
craig
leaned
over
to
me
and
whispered
hoarsely
keep
perfectly
still
do
move
a
hand
or
the
old
man
seemed
utterly
to
have
forgotten
us
is
that
you
john
he
asked
expectantly
rap
rap

then
after
a
pause
the
rapping
started
slowly
and
distinctly
to
spell
out
words
it
was
so
weird
and
uncanny
that
i
scarcely
breathed
letter
after
letter
the
message
came
nineteen
raps
for

to

alphabet
numerically
of

rap
rap
came
back
faintly
john
john
do
go
yet
pleaded
the
old
man
earnestly
it
was
easy
to
see
how
thoroughly
he
believed
in
john
as
perhaps
well
he
might
after
the
warning
of
his
wife
death
three
nights
before
wo
you
answer
one
other
question
fainter
almost
imperceptibly
came
a
rap
rap
for
several
minutes
the
old
man
sat
absorbed
in
thought
then
gradually
he
seemed
to
realise
that
we
were
in
the
room
with
him
with
difficulty
he
took
up
the
thread
of
the
conversation
where
the
rappings
had
broken
it
we
were
talking
about
the
photographs
he
said
slowly
i
hope
soon
to
get
one
of
my
wife
as
she
is
now
that
she
is
transfigured
john
has
promised
me
one
he
was
gathering
up
his
treasures
preparatory
to
putting
them
back
in
their
places
of
safekeeping
the
moment
he
was
out
of
the
room
craig
darted
into
the
cabinet
and
replaced
his
mechanism
in
the
box
then
he
began
softly
to
tap
the
walls
at
last
he
found
the
side
that
gave
a
noise
similar
to
that
which
we
had
heard
and
he
seemed
pleased
to
have
found
it
for
he
hastily
sketched
on
an
old
envelope
a
plan
of
that
part
of
the
house
noting
on
it
the
location
of
the
side
of
the
cabinet
kennedy
almost
dragged
me
back
to
our
apartment
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
examine
the
apparatus
at
his
leisure
he
turned
on
all
the
lights
took
the
thing
out
of
its
case
and
stripped
off
the
two
sheets
of
ruled
paper
wound
around
the
two
revolving
drums
he
laid
them
flat
on
the
table
and
studied
them
for
some
minutes
with
evidently
growing
satisfaction
at
last
he
turned
to
me
and
said
walter
here
is
a
ghost
caught
in
the
i
looked
dubiously
at
the
irregular
scrawl
on
the
paper
while
he
rang
up
the
homicide
bureau
of
the
central
office
and
left
word
for
to
call
him
up
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
still
eyeing
with
satisfaction
the
record
traced
on
the
sheets
of
paper
he
lighted
a
cigarette
in
a
way
and
added
it
proves
to
be
a
very
much
ghost
this
it
walked
up
to
the
wall
back
of
that
cabinet
rapped
listened
to
old
vandam
rapped
some
more
got
the
answer
it
wanted
and
walked
deliberately
away
the
cabinet
as
you
may
have
noticed
is
in
a
corner
of
the
room
with
one
side
along
the
hallway
the
ghost
must
have
been
in
the
but
who
was
it
not
so
fast
walter
laughed
craig
is
it
enough
for
one
night
that
we
have
found
out
that
much
fortunately
i
was
tired
or
i
certainly
should
have
dreamed
of
rappings
and
of
john
that
night
i
was
awakened
early
by
kennedy
talking
with
someone
over
the
telephone
it
was
inspector
of
course
i
heard
only
one
side
of
the
conversation
but
as
near
as
i
could
gather
kennedy
was
asking
the
inspector
to
obtain
several
samples
of
ink
for
him
i
had
not
heard
the
first
part
of
the
conversation
and
was
considerably
surprised
when
kennedy
hung
up
the
receiver
and
said
vandam
had
the
prescription
filled
again
early
this
morning
and
it
will
soon
be
in
the
hands
of
i
hope
i
have
spoiled
things
by
acting
too
soon
but
i
do
want
to
run
the
risk
of
a
double
well
i
said
it
is
incomprehensible
to
me
first
i
suspected
suicide
then
i
suspected
murder
now
i
almost
suspect
a
murder
and
a
suicide
the
fact
is
i
do
know
just
what
i
suspect
i
like
hanson
floored
i
wonder
if
vandam
would
voluntarily
take
all
the
capsules
at
once
in
order
to
be
with
his
wife
one
of
them
alone
would
be
quite
sufficient
if
the
should
take
a
notion
as
i
think
it
will
to
walk
in
the
daytime
replied
craig
enigmatically
i
do
want
to
run
any
chances
as
i
have
said
i
may
be
wrong
in
my
theory
of
the
case
walter
so
let
us
not
discuss
this
phase
of
it
until
i
have
gone
a
step
farther
and
am
sure
of
my
ground
man
will
get
the
capsules
before
vandam
has
a
chance
to
take
the
first
one
anyhow
the
had
a
purpose
in
that
message
for
tells
me
that
vandam
lawyer
visited
him
yesterday
and
in
all
probability
a
new
will
is
being
made
perhaps
has
already
been
we
breakfasted
in
silence
and
later
rode
down
to
the
office
of
hanson
who
greeted
us
enthusiastically
i
solved
it
at
last
he
cried
and
it
kennedy
looked
gravely
over
the
analysis
which
hanson
shoved
into
his
hand
and
seemed
very
much
interested
in
the
probable
quantity
of
morphine
that
must
have
been
taken
to
yield
such
an
analysis
the
physician
had
a
open
on
his
desk
our
old
ideas
of
the
infallible
test
of
morphine
poisoning
are
all
exploded
he
said
excitedly
beginning
to
read
a
passage
he
had
marked
in
the
book
have
thought
that
inequality
of
the
pupils
that
is
to
say
where
they
are
not
symmetrically
contracted
is
proof
that
a
case
is
not
one
of
narcotism
or
morphine
poisoning
but
professor
taylor
has
recorded
a
case
of
morphine
poisoning
in
which
the
unsymmetrical
contraction
occurred
there
now
until
i
happened
to
run
across
that
in
one
of
the
authorities
i
had
supposed
the
symmetrical
contraction
of
the
pupils
of
the
eyes
to
be
the
distinguishing
symptom
of
morphine
poisoning
professor
kennedy
in
my
opinion
we
can
after
all
make
out
our
case
as
one
of
morphine
is
that
case
in
the
book
all
you
base
your
opinion
on
asked
craig
with
excessive
politeness
yes
sir
replied
the
doctor
reluctantly
well
said
kennedy
quietly
if
you
will
investigate
that
case
quoted
from
professor
taylor
you
will
find
that
it
has
been
proved
that
the
patient
had
one
glass
then
my
contention
collapses
and
she
was
not
poisoned
no
i
do
not
say
that
all
i
say
is
that
expert
testimony
would
refute
us
as
far
as
we
have
gone
but
if
you
will
let
me
make
a
few
tests
of
my
own
i
can
readily
clear
up
that
end
of
the
case
i
now
feel
sure
let
me
take
these
samples
to
my
i
was
surprised
when
we
ran
into
inspector
waiting
for
us
in
the
corridor
of
the
criminal
courts
building
as
we
left
the
office
of
the
coroner
physician
he
rushed
up
to
kennedy
and
shoved
into
his
hand
a
in
which
six
capsules
rattled
kennedy
narrowly
inspected
the
box
opened
it
and
looked
thoughtfully
at
the
six
white
capsules
lying
so
innocently
within
one
of
these
capsules
would
have
been
worth
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
to
said
craig
contemplatively
as
he
shut
the
box
and
deposited
it
carefully
in
his
inside
vest
pocket
i
do
believe
i
even
said
good
morning
to
you
he
continued
i
hope
i
have
kept
you
waiting
here
long
have
you
obtained
the
samples
of
ink
yes
professor
here
they
are
as
soon
as
you
telephoned
this
morning
i
sent
my
men
out
separately
to
get
them
there
the
ink
from
the
druggist
this
is
from
the
vandam
library
this
is
from
room
and
this
is
from
popper
thank
you
inspector
i
do
know
what
i
do
without
your
help
said
kennedy
eagerly
taking
four
small
vials
from
him
science
is
all
right
but
organisation
enables
science
to
work
quickly
and
quickness
is
the
essence
of
this
during
the
afternoon
kennedy
was
very
busy
in
his
laboratory
where
i
found
him
that
night
after
my
hurried
dinner
from
which
he
was
absent
what
is
it
after
he
exclaimed
holding
up
a
glass
beaker
and
watching
the
reaction
of
something
he
poured
into
it
from
a
craig
i
believe
that
when
you
are
absorbed
in
a
case
you
would
rather
work
than
eat
did
you
have
any
lunch
after
i
left
you
i
do
think
so
he
replied
regarding
the
beaker
and
not
his
answer
now
walter
old
fellow
i
do
want
you
to
be
offended
with
me
but
really
i
can
work
better
if
you
do
constantly
remind
me
of
such
things
as
eating
and
sleeping
say
do
you
want
to
help
me
really
certainly
i
am
as
interested
in
the
case
as
you
are
but
i
ca
make
heads
or
tails
of
it
i
replied
then
i
wish
you
would
look
up
popper
and
have
a
private
seance
with
her
what
i
want
you
to
do
particularly
is
to
get
a
good
idea
of
the
looks
of
the
room
in
which
she
is
accustomed
to
work
going
to
duplicate
it
here
in
my
laboratory
as
nearly
as
possible
then
i
want
you
to
arrange
with
her
for
a
private
here
night
tell
her
it
is
with
a
few
professors
at
the
university
who
are
interested
in
psychical
research
and
that
vandam
will
be
present
i
rather
have
her
come
willingly
than
to
force
her
to
come
incidentally
watch
that
manager
of
hers
farrington
by
all
means
he
must
accompany
that
evening
i
dropped
casually
in
on
popper
she
was
a
woman
of
great
brilliance
and
delicacy
both
in
her
physical
and
mental
perceptions
of
exceptional
vivacity
and
cleverness
she
must
have
studied
me
more
closely
than
i
was
aware
of
for
i
believe
she
relied
on
diverting
my
attention
whenever
she
desired
to
produce
one
of
her
really
wonderful
results
needless
to
say
i
was
completely
mystified
by
her
performance
she
did
spirit
writing
that
would
have
done
credit
to
the
immortal
slade
told
me
a
lot
of
things
that
were
true
and
many
more
that
were
unverifiable
or
hopelessly
vague
it
was
really
worth
much
more
than
the
price
and
i
did
not
need
to
feign
the
interest
necessary
to
get
her
terms
for
a
circle
in
the
laboratory
of
course
i
had
to
make
the
terms
with
farrington
the
first
glance
aroused
my
suspicions
of
him
he
was
and
his
face
had
a
hard
and
mercenary
look
in
spite
of
perhaps
rather
because
of
my
repugnance
we
quickly
came
to
an
agreement
and
as
i
left
the
apartment
i
mentally
resolved
to
keep
my
eye
on
him
craig
came
in
late
having
been
engaged
in
his
chemical
analyses
all
the
evening
from
his
manner
i
inferred
that
they
had
been
satisfactory
and
he
seemed
much
gratified
when
i
told
him
that
i
had
arranged
successfully
for
the
seance
and
that
farrington
would
accompany
the
medium
as
we
were
talking
over
the
case
a
messenger
arrived
with
a
note
from
it
was
written
with
his
usual
brevity
have
just
found
from
servants
that
farrington
and
have
key
to
vandam
house
wish
i
had
known
it
before
house
shadowed
no
one
has
entered
or
left
it
craig
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
a
quarter
after
one
the
ghost
wo
walk
walter
he
said
as
he
entered
his
bedroom
for
a
rest
i
guess
i
was
right
after
all
in
getting
the
capsules
as
soon
as
possible
the
ghost
must
have
flitted
unobserved
in
there
this
morning
directly
after
the
maid
brought
them
back
from
the
again
the
next
morning
he
had
me
out
of
bed
bright
and
early
as
we
descended
from
the
sixth
avenue
l
he
led
me
into
a
peculiar
little
shop
in
the
shadow
of
the
l
structure
he
entered
as
though
he
knew
the
place
well
but
then
that
air
of
assurance
was
kennedy
stock
in
trade
and
sat
very
well
on
him
few
people
i
suppose
have
ever
had
a
glimpse
of
this
workshop
of
magic
and
deception
this
little
shop
of
marina
was
the
headquarters
of
the
magicians
of
the
country
levitation
and
ghostly
disappearing
hands
were
on
every
side
the
shelves
in
the
back
of
the
shop
were
full
of
nickel
brass
wire
wood
and
contrivances
new
and
strange
to
the
eye
of
the
uninitiated
yet
it
was
all
as
systematic
as
a
hardware
shop
is
signor
marina
in
asked
craig
of
a
girl
in
the
first
room
given
up
to
picture
the
room
was
as
deceptive
as
the
trade
for
it
was
only
an
anteroom
to
the
storeroom
i
have
described
above
this
storeroom
was
also
a
factory
and
half
a
dozen
artisans
were
hard
at
work
in
it
yes
the
signor
was
in
the
girl
replied
leading
us
back
into
the
workshop
he
proved
to
be
a
short
man
with
a
bland
open
face
and
frank
eyes
the
very
antithesis
of
his
trade
i
have
arranged
for
a
circle
with
may
popper
began
kennedy
handing
the
man
his
card
i
suppose
you
know
her
indeed
yes
he
answered
i
furnished
her
seance
well
i
want
to
hire
for
just
the
same
sort
of
tables
cabinets
carpets
everything
that
she
has
only
hire
you
understand
but
i
am
willing
to
pay
you
well
for
them
it
is
the
best
way
to
get
a
good
sitting
i
believe
can
you
do
it
the
little
man
thought
a
moment
then
replied
si
signor
yes
very
nearly
near
enough
i
would
do
anything
for
popper
she
is
a
good
customer
but
her
manager
my
friend
here
jameson
has
had
seances
with
her
in
her
own
apartment
interposed
craig
perhaps
he
can
help
you
to
recollect
just
what
is
i
know
very
well
signor
i
have
the
duplicate
bill
the
bill
which
was
paid
by
that
farrington
with
a
check
from
the
banker
vandam
leave
it
to
then
you
will
get
the
stuff
together
this
morning
and
have
it
up
to
my
place
this
yes
professor
yes
it
is
a
bargain
i
would
do
anything
for
popper
she
is
a
fine
late
that
afternoon
i
rejoined
craig
at
his
laboratory
signor
marina
had
already
arrived
with
a
truck
and
was
disposing
the
paraphernalia
about
the
laboratory
he
had
first
laid
a
thick
black
rug
popper
very
much
affected
black
carpets
and
i
had
noticed
that
vandam
room
was
carpeted
in
black
too
i
suppose
black
conceals
everything
that
one
ought
to
see
at
a
seance
a
cabinet
with
a
black
curtain
several
chairs
a
light
deal
table
several
banjos
horns
and
other
instruments
were
disposed
about
the
room
with
a
few
suggestions
from
me
we
made
a
fair
duplication
of
the
hangings
on
the
walls
kennedy
was
manifestly
anxious
to
finish
and
at
last
it
was
done
after
marina
had
gone
kennedy
stretched
a
curtain
over
the
end
of
the
room
farthest
from
the
cabinet
behind
it
he
placed
on
a
shelf
the
apparatus
composed
of
the
pendulums
and
magnets
the
beakers
and
were
also
on
this
shelf
he
had
also
arranged
that
the
cabinet
should
be
so
situated
that
it
was
next
a
hallway
that
ran
past
his
laboratory
jameson
he
said
indicating
a
spot
on
the
hall
wall
just
back
of
the
cabinet
i
shall
want
you
to
bring
my
guests
out
here
and
do
a
little
spirit
rapping
i
tell
you
just
what
to
do
when
the
time
that
night
when
we
gathered
in
the
transformed
laboratory
there
were
henry
vandam
hanson
inspector
kennedy
and
myself
at
last
the
sound
of
wheels
was
heard
and
popper
drove
up
in
a
hansom
accompanied
by
farrington
they
both
inspected
the
room
narrowly
and
seemed
satisfied
i
had
as
i
have
said
taken
a
serious
dislike
to
the
man
and
watched
him
closely
i
did
not
like
his
air
of
calm
assurance
the
lights
were
switched
off
all
except
one
lamp
in
the
farthest
corner
shaded
by
a
globe
it
was
just
light
enough
to
see
to
read
very
large
print
with
difficulty
popper
began
immediately
with
the
table
kennedy
and
i
sat
on
her
right
and
left
respectively
in
the
circle
and
held
her
hands
and
feet
i
confess
to
a
real
thrill
when
i
felt
the
light
table
rise
first
on
two
legs
then
on
one
and
finally
remain
suspended
in
the
air
whence
it
dropped
with
a
thud
as
if
someone
had
suddenly
withdrawn
his
support
the
medium
sat
with
her
back
to
the
curtain
of
the
cabinet
and
several
times
i
could
have
sworn
that
a
hand
reached
out
and
passed
close
to
my
head
at
least
it
seemed
so
the
curtain
bulged
at
times
and
a
breeze
seemed
to
sweep
out
from
the
cabinet
after
some
time
of
this
sort
of
work
craig
led
gradually
up
to
a
request
for
a
materialisation
of
the
control
of
vandam
but
popper
refused
she
said
she
did
not
feel
strong
enough
and
farrington
put
in
a
hasty
word
that
he
too
could
feel
that
there
was
something
working
against
but
kennedy
was
importunate
and
at
last
she
consented
to
see
if
john
would
do
some
rapping
even
if
he
could
not
materialise
kennedy
asked
to
be
permitted
to
put
the
questions
are
you
the
who
appears
to
vandam
every
night
at
rap
rap
rap
came
the
faint
reply
from
the
cabinet
or
rather
it
seemed
to
me
to
come
from
the
floor
near
the
cabinet
and
perhaps
to
be
a
trifle
muffled
by
the
black
carpet
are
you
in
communication
with
vandam
rap
rap
rap
can
she
be
made
to
rap
for
us
rap
rap
will
you
ask
her
a
question
and
spell
out
her
answer
rap
rap
rap
craig
paused
a
moment
to
frame
the
question
then
shot
it
out
does
vandam
know
now
in
the
other
world
whether
anyone
in
this
room
substituted
a
morphine
capsule
for
one
of
those
ordered
by
her
three
days
before
she
died
does
she
know
whether
the
same
person
has
done
the
same
thing
with
those
later
ordered
by
vandam
john
seemed
considerably
perturbed
at
the
mention
of
capsules
it
was
a
long
time
before
any
answer
was
forthcoming
kennedy
was
about
to
repeat
the
question
when
a
faint
sound
was
heard
rap
suddenly
came
a
wild
scream
it
was
such
a
scream
as
i
had
never
heard
before
in
my
life
it
came
as
though
a
dagger
had
been
thrust
into
the
heart
of
popper
the
lights
flashed
up
as
kennedy
turned
the
switch
a
man
was
lying
flat
on
the
floor
it
was
inspector
he
had
succeeded
in
slipping
noiselessly
like
a
snake
below
the
curtain
into
the
cabinet
craig
had
told
him
to
look
out
for
wires
or
threads
stretched
from
popper
clothing
to
the
bulging
curtain
of
the
cabinet
imagine
his
surprise
when
he
saw
that
she
had
simply
freed
her
foot
from
the
shoe
which
i
was
carefully
holding
down
and
with
a
backward
movement
of
the
leg
was
reaching
out
into
the
cabinet
behind
her
chair
and
was
doing
the
rapping
with
her
toes
lying
on
the
floor
he
had
grasped
her
foot
and
caught
her
heel
with
a
firm
hand
she
had
responded
with
a
wild
yell
that
showed
she
knew
she
was
trapped
her
secret
was
out
hysterically
popper
began
to
upbraid
the
inspector
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
but
farrington
quickly
interposed
something
was
working
against
us
gentlemen
yet
you
demanded
results
and
when
the
spirits
will
not
come
what
is
she
to
do
she
forgets
herself
in
her
trance
she
produces
herself
the
things
that
you
all
could
see
supernaturally
if
you
were
in
the
mere
sound
of
farrington
voice
seemed
to
rouse
in
me
all
the
animosity
of
my
nature
i
felt
that
a
man
who
could
trump
up
an
excuse
like
that
when
a
person
was
caught
with
the
goods
was
capable
of
almost
anything
enough
of
this
fake
seance
exclaimed
craig
i
have
let
it
go
on
merely
for
the
purpose
of
opening
the
eyes
of
a
certain
deluded
gentleman
in
this
room
now
if
you
will
all
be
seated
i
shall
have
something
to
say
that
will
finally
establish
whether
mary
vandam
was
the
victim
of
accident
suicide
or
with
hearts
beating
rapidly
we
sat
in
silence
craig
took
the
beakers
and
from
the
shelf
behind
the
curtain
and
placed
them
on
the
little
deal
table
that
had
been
so
merrily
dancing
about
the
room
the
increasing
frequency
with
which
tales
of
murder
by
poison
appear
in
the
newspapers
he
began
formally
is
proof
of
how
rapidly
this
new
civilisation
of
ours
is
taking
on
the
aspects
of
the
older
civilisations
across
the
seas
human
life
is
cheap
in
this
country
but
the
ways
in
which
human
life
has
been
taken
among
us
have
usually
been
direct
simple
aboveboard
in
keeping
with
our
democratic
and
pioneer
traditions
the
pistol
and
the
for
the
individual
the
rope
and
the
torch
for
the
mob
have
been
the
usual
instruments
of
sudden
death
but
when
we
begin
to
use
poisons
most
artfully
compounded
in
order
to
hasten
an
expected
bequest
and
remove
obstacles
in
its
way
well
we
are
practising
an
art
that
calls
up
all
the
memories
of
sixteenth
century
italy
in
this
beaker
he
continued
i
have
some
of
the
contents
of
the
stomach
of
the
unfortunate
woman
the
coroner
physician
has
found
that
they
show
traces
of
morphine
was
the
morphine
in
such
quantities
as
to
be
fatal
without
doubt
but
equally
without
doubt
analysis
could
not
discover
and
prove
it
in
the
face
of
one
inconsistency
the
usual
test
which
shows
morphine
poisoning
failed
in
this
case
the
pupils
of
her
eyes
were
not
symmetrically
contracted
in
fact
they
were
normal
now
the
murderer
must
have
known
of
this
test
this
clever
criminal
also
knew
that
to
be
successful
in
the
use
of
this
drug
where
others
had
failed
the
drug
must
be
skilfully
mixed
with
something
else
in
that
first
box
of
capsules
there
were
six
the
druggist
compounded
them
correctly
according
to
the
prescription
but
between
the
time
when
they
came
into
the
house
from
the
druggist
and
the
time
when
she
took
the
first
capsule
that
night
someone
who
had
access
to
the
house
emptied
one
capsule
of
its
harmless
contents
and
refilled
it
with
a
deadly
dose
of
morphine
a
white
powder
which
looks
just
like
the
powder
already
in
the
capsules
why
then
the
normal
pupils
of
the
eyes
simply
because
the
criminal
put
a
little
atropine
or
belladonna
with
the
morphine
my
tests
show
absolutely
the
presence
of
atropine
hanson
said
craig
bowing
to
the
physician
the
best
evidence
however
is
yet
to
come
a
second
box
of
six
capsules
all
intact
was
discovered
yesterday
in
the
possession
of
henry
vandam
i
have
analysed
the
capsules
one
contains
no
quinine
at
all
it
is
all
morphine
and
atropine
it
is
without
doubt
precisely
similar
to
the
capsule
which
killed
vandam
another
night
or
so
and
henry
vandam
would
have
died
the
same
the
old
man
groaned
two
such
exposures
had
shaken
him
he
looked
from
one
of
us
to
another
as
if
not
knowing
in
whom
he
could
trust
but
kennedy
hurried
on
to
his
next
point
who
was
it
that
gave
the
prescription
to
vandam
originally
she
is
dead
and
can
not
tell
the
others
wo
tell
for
the
person
who
gave
her
that
prescription
was
the
person
who
later
substituted
the
fatal
capsule
in
place
of
the
harmless
the
original
prescription
is
here
i
have
been
able
to
discover
from
it
nothing
at
all
by
examining
the
handwriting
nor
does
the
texture
of
the
paper
indicate
anything
to
me
but
the
ink
ah
the
ink
most
inks
seem
very
similar
i
suppose
but
to
a
person
who
has
made
a
study
of
the
chemical
composition
of
ink
they
are
very
different
ink
is
composed
of
iron
tannate
which
on
exposure
to
air
gives
the
black
of
writing
the
original
pigment
say
blue
or
ink
is
placed
in
the
ink
to
make
the
writing
visible
at
first
and
gradually
fades
giving
place
to
the
black
of
the
tannate
which
is
formed
the
dyestuffs
employed
in
the
commercial
inks
of
vary
in
colour
from
pale
greenish
blue
to
indigo
and
deep
violet
no
two
give
identical
reactions
at
all
events
not
when
mixed
with
the
iron
tannate
to
form
the
pigment
in
writing
it
is
owing
to
the
difference
in
these
provisional
colouring
matters
that
it
is
possible
to
distinguish
between
writing
written
with
different
kinds
of
ink
i
was
able
easily
to
obtain
samples
of
the
inks
used
by
the
vandams
by
popper
by
farrington
and
by
the
druggist
i
have
compared
the
writing
of
the
original
prescription
with
a
colour
scale
of
my
own
construction
and
i
have
made
chemical
tests
the
druggist
ink
conforms
exactly
to
the
writing
on
the
two
but
not
to
the
prescription
one
of
the
other
three
inks
conforms
by
test
absolutely
to
the
ink
in
that
prescription
signed
as
a
blind
in
a
moment
my
chain
of
evidence
against
the
owner
of
that
bottle
of
ink
will
be
i
could
not
help
but
think
of
the
two
pendulums
on
the
shelf
behind
the
curtain
but
craig
said
nothing
for
a
moment
to
indicate
that
he
referred
to
that
apparatus
we
sat
dazed
farrington
seemed
nervous
and
ill
at
ease
popper
who
had
not
recovered
from
the
hysterical
condition
of
her
exposure
with
difficulty
controlled
her
emotion
vandam
was
crushed
i
have
not
only
arranged
this
laboratory
so
as
to
reproduce
popper
began
craig
afresh
but
i
have
had
the
cabinet
placed
in
relatively
the
same
position
a
similar
cabinet
occupies
in
vandam
private
in
the
vandam
mansion
one
night
jameson
and
myself
were
visiting
vandam
at
precisely
we
heard
most
unaccountable
rappings
from
that
cabinet
i
particularly
noted
the
position
of
the
cabinet
back
of
it
ran
a
hallway
that
is
duplicated
here
back
of
this
cabinet
is
a
hallway
i
had
heard
of
these
rappings
before
we
went
but
was
afraid
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
catch
the
ghost
red
handed
there
is
a
limit
to
what
you
can
do
the
first
time
you
enter
a
man
house
and
besides
that
was
no
time
to
arouse
suspicion
in
the
mind
of
anyone
but
science
has
a
way
out
of
every
dilemma
i
determined
to
learn
something
of
these
craig
paused
and
glanced
first
at
farrington
then
at
popper
and
then
at
vandam
mr
jameson
he
resumed
will
escort
the
doctor
the
inspector
farrington
popper
and
vandam
into
my
imitation
hall
of
the
vandam
mansion
i
want
each
of
you
in
turn
to
tiptoe
up
that
hall
to
a
spot
indicated
on
the
wall
back
of
the
cabinet
and
strike
that
spot
several
sharp
blows
with
your
i
did
as
craig
instructed
tiptoeing
up
myself
first
so
that
they
could
not
mistake
his
meaning
the
rest
followed
separately
and
after
a
moment
we
returned
silently
in
suppressed
excitement
to
the
room
craig
was
still
standing
by
the
table
but
now
the
pendulums
with
the
magnets
and
needles
and
the
drums
worked
by
clockwork
were
before
him
another
person
outside
the
vandam
family
had
a
key
to
the
vandam
mansion
he
began
gravely
that
person
by
the
way
was
the
one
who
waited
night
by
night
until
vandam
took
the
fatal
capsule
and
then
when
she
had
taken
it
apprised
the
old
man
of
the
fact
and
strengthened
an
already
blind
faith
in
the
shadow
you
could
have
heard
a
pin
drop
in
fact
you
could
almost
have
felt
it
drop
that
other
person
who
unobserved
had
free
access
to
the
house
he
continued
in
the
breathless
stillness
is
in
this
room
he
was
looking
at
as
if
for
corroboration
nodded
information
derived
from
the
butler
he
muttered
i
did
not
know
this
until
yesterday
kennedy
continued
but
i
suspected
that
something
of
the
sort
existed
when
i
was
first
told
by
hanson
of
the
rappings
i
determined
to
hear
those
rappings
and
make
a
record
of
them
so
the
night
jameson
and
i
visited
vandam
i
carried
this
little
instrument
with
almost
lovingly
he
touched
the
pendulums
on
the
table
they
were
now
at
rest
and
kept
so
by
means
of
a
lever
that
prevented
all
vibration
whatever
see
i
release
this
lever
now
let
no
one
in
the
room
move
watch
the
needles
on
the
paper
as
the
clockwork
revolves
the
drums
i
take
a
step
ever
so
lightly
the
pendulums
vibrate
and
the
needles
trace
a
broken
line
on
the
paper
on
each
drum
i
stop
the
lines
are
practically
straight
i
take
another
step
and
another
ever
so
lightly
see
the
delicate
pendulums
vibrate
see
the
lines
they
trace
are
jagged
he
stripped
the
paper
off
the
drums
and
laid
it
flat
on
the
table
before
him
with
two
other
similar
pieces
of
paper
just
before
the
time
of
the
rapping
i
placed
this
instrument
in
the
corner
of
the
vandam
cabinet
just
as
i
placed
it
in
this
cabinet
after
jameson
conducted
you
from
the
room
in
neither
case
were
suspicions
aroused
everything
in
both
cases
was
perfectly
normal
i
mean
the
was
in
ignorance
of
the
presence
if
not
the
very
existence
of
this
instrument
this
is
an
improved
seismograph
he
explained
one
after
a
very
recent
model
by
prince
galitzin
of
the
imperial
academy
of
petersburg
the
seismograph
as
you
know
was
devised
to
register
earthquakes
at
a
distance
this
one
not
only
measures
the
size
of
a
distant
earthquake
but
the
actual
direction
from
which
the
come
that
is
why
there
are
two
pendulums
and
two
drums
the
magnetic
arrangement
is
to
cut
short
the
vibrations
set
up
in
the
pendulums
to
prevent
them
from
continuing
to
vibrate
after
the
first
shock
thus
they
are
ready
in
an
instant
to
record
another
tremor
other
seismographs
continue
to
vibrate
for
a
long
time
as
a
result
of
one
tremor
only
besides
they
give
little
indication
of
the
direction
from
which
the
tremors
come
i
think
you
must
all
appreciate
that
your
tiptoeing
up
the
hall
must
cause
a
far
greater
disturbance
in
this
delicate
seismograph
than
even
a
very
severe
earthquake
thousands
of
miles
away
which
it
was
built
to
he
paused
and
examined
the
papers
sharply
this
is
the
record
made
by
the
walk
the
other
night
he
said
holding
up
two
of
them
in
his
left
hand
here
on
the
table
on
two
other
longer
sheets
i
have
records
of
the
vibrations
set
up
by
those
in
this
room
walking
here
is
jameson
his
is
not
a
bit
like
the
ghost
nor
is
vandam
least
of
all
are
hanson
and
inspector
for
they
are
heavy
men
now
here
is
farrington
he
bent
down
closely
he
is
a
light
man
and
the
ghost
was
craig
was
playing
with
his
victim
like
a
cat
with
a
mouse
suddenly
i
felt
something
brush
by
me
and
with
a
swish
of
air
and
of
garments
i
saw
popper
fling
herself
wildly
at
the
table
that
bore
the
incriminating
records
in
another
instant
farrington
was
on
his
feet
and
had
made
a
wild
leap
in
the
same
direction
it
was
done
so
quickly
that
i
must
have
acted
first
and
thought
afterward
i
found
myself
in
the
midst
of
a
melee
with
my
hand
at
his
throat
and
his
at
mine
with
a
movement
bent
farrington
other
arm
until
he
released
me
with
a
cry
of
pain
in
front
of
me
i
saw
craig
grasping
popper
wrists
as
in
a
vise
she
was
glaring
at
him
like
a
tigress
do
you
suppose
for
a
moment
that
that
toy
is
going
to
convince
the
world
that
henry
vandam
has
been
deceived
and
that
the
spirit
which
visited
him
was
a
fraud
is
that
why
you
have
lured
me
here
under
false
pretences
to
play
on
my
feelings
to
insult
me
to
take
advantage
of
a
lone
defenceless
woman
surrounded
by
hostile
men
shame
on
you
she
added
contemptuously
you
call
yourself
a
gentleman
but
i
call
you
a
kennedy
always
calm
and
collected
ignored
the
tirade
his
voice
was
as
cold
as
steel
as
he
said
it
would
do
little
good
popper
to
destroy
this
one
link
in
the
chain
i
have
forged
the
other
links
are
too
heavy
for
you
do
forget
the
evidence
of
the
ink
it
was
your
ink
do
forget
that
henry
vandam
will
not
any
longer
conceal
that
he
has
altered
his
will
in
favour
of
you
he
goes
from
here
to
his
lawyer
to
draw
up
a
new
will
altogether
do
forget
that
you
have
caused
the
vandams
separately
to
have
the
prescription
filled
and
that
you
are
now
caught
in
the
act
of
a
double
murder
do
forget
that
you
had
access
to
the
vandam
mansion
that
you
substituted
the
deadly
for
the
harmless
capsules
do
forget
that
your
rappings
announced
the
death
of
one
of
your
victims
and
urged
the
other
a
cruelly
wronged
and
credulous
old
man
to
leave
millions
to
you
who
had
deceived
and
would
have
killed
him
no
the
record
of
the
ghost
on
the
seismograph
was
not
farrington
as
i
implied
at
the
moment
when
you
so
kindly
furnished
this
additional
proof
of
your
guilt
by
trying
to
destroy
the
evidence
the
ghost
was
you
popper
and
you
are
at
liberty
to
examine
the
markings
as
minutely
as
you
please
but
you
must
not
destroy
them
you
are
an
astute
criminal
popper
but
you
are
under
arrest
for
the
murder
of
mary
vandam
and
the
attempted
murder
of
henry
vi
the
diamond
maker
i
called
professor
kennedy
to
see
if
we
can
retain
you
in
a
case
which
i
am
sure
will
tax
even
your
resources
heaven
knows
it
has
taxed
the
visitor
was
a
large
man
he
placed
his
hat
on
the
table
and
without
taking
off
his
gloves
sat
down
in
an
easy
chair
which
he
completely
filled
andrews
is
my
name
third
of
the
great
eastern
life
insurance
company
i
am
the
nominal
head
of
the
company
private
detective
force
and
though
i
have
some
pretty
clever
fellows
on
my
staff
we
got
a
case
that
so
far
none
of
us
has
been
able
to
unravel
i
like
to
consult
you
about
kennedy
expressed
his
entire
willingness
to
be
consulted
and
after
the
usual
formalities
were
over
andrews
proceeded
i
suppose
you
are
aware
that
the
large
insurance
companies
maintain
quite
elaborate
detective
forces
and
follow
very
keenly
such
of
the
cases
of
their
as
look
at
all
suspicious
this
case
which
i
wish
to
put
in
your
hands
is
that
of
solomon
morowitch
a
wealthy
maiden
lane
jeweller
i
suppose
you
have
read
something
in
the
papers
about
his
sudden
death
and
the
strange
robbery
of
his
safe
very
little
replied
craig
there
has
been
much
to
of
course
not
of
course
not
said
andrews
with
some
show
of
gratification
i
flatter
myself
that
we
have
pulled
the
wires
so
as
to
keep
the
thing
out
of
the
papers
as
much
as
possible
we
do
want
to
frighten
the
quarry
till
the
net
is
spread
the
point
is
though
to
find
out
who
is
the
quarry
it
most
i
am
at
your
service
interposed
craig
quietly
but
you
will
have
to
enlighten
me
as
to
the
facts
in
the
case
as
to
that
i
know
no
more
than
the
oh
certainly
certainly
that
is
to
say
you
know
nothing
at
all
and
can
approach
it
without
he
paused
and
then
seeming
to
notice
something
in
craig
manner
added
hastily
i
be
perfectly
frank
with
you
the
policy
in
question
is
for
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
is
incontestable
his
wife
is
the
beneficiary
the
company
is
perfectly
willing
to
pay
but
we
want
to
be
sure
that
it
is
all
straight
first
there
are
certain
suspicious
circumstances
that
in
justice
to
ourselves
we
think
should
be
cleared
up
that
is
all
believe
me
we
are
not
seeking
to
avoid
an
honest
what
are
these
suspicious
circumstances
asked
craig
apparently
satisfied
with
the
explanation
this
is
in
strict
confidence
gentlemen
began
andrews
mr
morowitch
according
to
the
story
as
it
comes
to
us
returned
home
late
one
night
last
week
apparently
from
his
office
in
a
very
weakened
a
semiconscious
condition
his
family
physician
doctor
thornton
was
summoned
not
at
once
but
shortly
he
pronounced
morowitch
to
be
suffering
from
a
congestion
of
the
lungs
that
was
very
like
a
sudden
attack
of
pneumonia
mr
morowitch
had
at
once
gone
to
bed
or
at
least
was
in
bed
when
the
doctor
arrived
but
his
condition
grew
worse
so
rapidly
that
the
doctor
hastily
resorted
to
oxygen
under
which
treatment
he
seemed
to
revive
the
doctor
had
just
stepped
out
to
see
another
patient
when
a
hurry
call
was
sent
to
him
that
morowitch
was
rapidly
sinking
he
died
before
the
doctor
could
return
no
statement
whatever
concerning
the
cause
of
his
sudden
illness
was
made
by
morowitch
and
the
a
copy
of
which
i
have
gives
pneumonia
as
the
cause
of
death
one
of
our
men
has
seen
doctor
thornton
but
has
been
able
to
get
nothing
out
of
him
morowitch
was
the
only
person
with
her
husband
at
the
there
was
something
in
his
tone
that
made
me
take
particular
note
of
this
last
fact
especially
as
he
paused
for
an
instant
now
perhaps
there
would
be
nothing
surprising
about
it
all
so
far
at
least
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
the
following
morning
when
his
junior
partner
kahan
opened
the
place
of
business
or
rather
went
to
it
for
it
was
to
remain
closed
of
course
he
found
that
during
the
night
someone
had
visited
it
the
lock
on
the
great
safe
which
contained
thousands
of
dollars
worth
of
diamonds
was
intact
but
in
the
top
of
the
safe
a
huge
hole
was
found
an
irregular
round
hole
big
enough
to
put
your
foot
through
imagine
it
professor
kennedy
a
great
hole
in
a
safe
that
is
made
of
chrome
steel
a
safe
that
short
of
a
vault
ought
to
be
about
the
strongest
thing
on
earth
why
that
steel
would
dull
and
splinter
even
the
finest
before
it
made
an
impression
the
mere
taking
out
and
refitting
of
drills
into
the
brace
would
be
a
most
lengthy
process
eighteen
or
twenty
hours
is
the
time
by
actual
test
which
it
would
take
to
bore
such
a
hole
through
those
laminated
plates
even
if
there
were
means
of
exerting
artificial
pressure
as
for
the
police
they
have
even
a
theory
and
the
diamonds
all
gone
everything
of
any
value
was
gone
even
the
were
ransacked
his
desk
was
broken
open
and
papers
of
some
nature
had
been
taken
out
of
it
thorough
is
no
name
for
the
job
is
that
enough
to
arouse
suspicion
i
should
like
to
see
that
safe
was
all
kennedy
said
so
you
shall
so
you
shall
said
andrews
then
we
may
retain
you
in
our
service
my
car
is
waiting
we
can
go
right
down
to
maiden
lane
if
you
you
may
retain
me
on
one
condition
said
craig
without
moving
i
am
to
be
free
to
get
at
the
truth
whether
it
benefits
or
hurts
the
company
and
the
case
is
to
be
entirely
in
my
hats
on
agreed
andrews
reaching
in
his
vest
pocket
and
pulling
out
three
or
four
brevas
my
chauffeur
is
quite
a
driver
he
can
almost
beat
the
subway
first
to
my
laboratory
interposed
craig
it
will
take
only
a
few
we
drove
up
to
the
university
and
stopped
on
the
campus
while
craig
hurried
into
the
chemistry
building
to
get
something
i
like
your
professor
of
criminal
science
said
andrews
to
me
blowing
a
huge
fragrant
cloud
of
smoke
i
for
my
part
liked
the
he
was
a
man
who
seemed
thoroughly
to
enjoy
life
to
have
most
of
the
good
things
and
a
capacity
for
getting
out
of
them
all
that
was
humanly
possible
he
seemed
to
be
particularly
enjoying
this
morowitch
case
he
has
solved
some
knotty
cases
was
all
i
said
i
come
to
believe
there
is
no
limit
to
his
i
hope
not
he
up
against
a
tough
one
this
trip
though
my
i
did
not
even
resent
the
my
andrews
was
one
of
those
men
in
whom
we
newspaper
writers
instinctively
believe
i
knew
that
it
would
be
pens
lifted
only
so
long
as
the
case
was
incomplete
when
the
time
comes
with
such
men
they
are
ready
to
furnish
us
the
best
copy
in
the
world
kennedy
quickly
rejoined
us
carrying
a
couple
of
little
glass
bottles
with
stoppers
morowitch
was
of
course
closed
when
we
arrived
but
we
had
no
trouble
in
being
admitted
by
the
central
office
man
who
had
been
detailed
to
lock
the
barn
door
after
the
horse
was
stolen
it
was
precisely
as
andrews
had
said
kahan
showed
us
the
safe
through
the
top
a
great
hole
had
been
made
i
say
made
for
at
the
moment
i
was
at
a
loss
to
know
whether
it
had
been
cut
drilled
burned
blown
out
or
kennedy
examined
the
edges
of
the
hole
carefully
and
just
the
trace
of
a
smile
of
satisfaction
flitted
over
his
face
as
he
did
so
without
saying
a
word
he
took
the
glass
stopper
out
of
the
larger
bottle
which
he
had
brought
and
poured
the
contents
on
the
top
of
the
safe
near
the
hole
there
it
lay
a
little
mound
of
reddish
powder
kennedy
took
a
little
powder
of
another
kind
from
the
other
bottle
and
lighted
it
with
a
match
stand
back
close
to
the
wall
he
called
as
he
dropped
the
burning
mass
on
the
red
powder
in
two
or
three
leaps
he
joined
us
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
almost
instantly
a
dazzling
intense
flame
broke
out
and
sizzled
and
crackled
with
bated
breath
we
watched
it
was
almost
incredible
but
that
glowing
mass
of
powder
seemed
literally
to
be
sinking
sinking
right
down
into
the
cold
steel
in
tense
silence
we
waited
on
the
ceiling
we
could
still
see
the
reflection
of
the
molten
mass
in
the
cup
which
it
had
burned
for
itself
in
the
top
of
the
safe
at
last
it
fell
through
into
the
safe
fell
as
the
burning
roof
of
a
frame
building
would
fall
into
the
building
no
one
spoke
a
word
but
as
we
cautiously
peered
over
the
top
of
the
safe
we
instinctively
turned
to
kennedy
for
an
explanation
the
central
office
man
with
eyes
as
big
as
acted
almost
as
if
he
would
have
liked
to
clap
the
irons
on
kennedy
for
there
in
the
top
of
the
safe
was
another
hole
smaller
but
identical
in
nature
with
the
first
one
thermit
was
all
kennedy
said
thermit
echoed
andrews
shifting
the
cigar
which
he
had
allowed
to
go
out
in
the
excitement
yes
an
invention
of
a
chemist
named
goldschmidt
of
essen
germany
it
is
a
compound
of
iron
oxide
such
as
comes
off
a
blacksmith
anvil
or
the
rolls
of
a
and
powdered
metallic
aluminum
you
could
thrust
a
bar
into
it
without
setting
it
off
but
when
you
light
a
little
magnesium
powder
and
drop
it
on
thermit
a
combustion
is
started
that
quickly
reaches
hundred
degrees
fahrenheit
it
has
the
peculiar
property
of
concentrating
its
heat
to
the
immediate
spot
on
which
it
is
placed
it
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
oxidising
agents
known
and
it
does
even
melt
the
rest
of
the
steel
surface
you
see
how
it
ate
its
way
through
the
steel
either
black
or
red
thermit
will
do
the
trick
equally
no
one
said
anything
there
was
nothing
to
say
someone
uncommonly
clever
or
instructed
by
someone
uncommonly
clever
must
have
done
that
job
added
craig
well
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
done
here
he
added
after
a
cursory
look
about
the
office
mr
andrews
may
i
have
a
word
with
you
come
on
jameson
good
day
kahan
good
day
outside
we
stopped
for
a
moment
at
the
door
of
andrews
car
i
shall
want
to
see
morowitch
papers
at
home
said
craig
and
also
to
call
on
doctor
thornton
do
you
think
i
shall
have
any
difficulty
not
at
all
replied
andrews
not
at
all
i
will
go
with
you
myself
and
see
that
you
have
none
say
professor
kennedy
he
broke
out
that
was
marvellous
i
never
dreamed
such
a
thing
was
possible
but
do
you
think
you
could
have
learned
something
more
up
there
in
the
office
by
looking
around
i
did
learn
it
answered
kennedy
the
lock
on
the
door
was
intact
whoever
did
the
job
let
himself
in
by
a
key
there
is
no
other
way
to
get
andrews
gave
a
low
whistle
and
glanced
involuntarily
up
at
the
window
with
the
sign
of
morowitch
in
gold
letters
several
floors
above
do
look
up
i
think
that
was
kahan
looking
out
at
us
he
said
fixing
his
eyes
on
his
cigar
i
wonder
if
he
knows
more
about
this
than
he
has
told
he
was
the
you
know
but
his
interest
in
the
business
was
only
very
slight
by
george
not
too
fast
andrews
interrupted
craig
we
have
still
to
see
morowitch
and
the
doctor
before
we
form
any
a
very
handsome
woman
too
said
andrews
as
we
seated
ourselves
in
the
car
a
good
deal
younger
than
morowitch
say
kahan
is
a
chap
either
is
he
i
hear
he
was
a
very
frequent
visitor
at
his
partner
house
well
which
first
or
the
doctor
the
house
answered
craig
andrews
introduced
us
to
morowitch
who
was
in
very
deep
mourning
which
served
as
i
could
not
help
noticing
rather
to
heighten
than
lessen
her
beauty
by
contrast
it
brought
out
the
rich
deep
colour
of
her
face
and
the
graceful
lines
of
her
figure
she
was
altogether
a
very
attractive
young
widow
she
seemed
to
have
a
sort
of
fear
of
andrews
whether
merely
because
he
represented
the
insurance
company
on
which
so
much
depended
or
because
there
were
other
reasons
for
fear
i
could
not
of
course
make
out
andrews
was
very
courteous
and
polite
yet
i
caught
myself
asking
if
it
was
not
a
professional
rather
than
a
personal
politeness
remembering
his
stress
on
the
fact
that
she
was
alone
with
her
husband
when
he
died
it
suddenly
flashed
across
my
mind
that
somewhere
i
had
read
of
a
detective
who
as
his
net
was
being
woven
about
a
victim
always
grew
more
and
more
ominously
polite
toward
the
victim
i
know
that
andrews
suspected
her
of
a
close
connection
with
the
case
as
for
myself
i
do
know
what
i
suspected
as
yet
no
objection
was
offered
to
our
request
to
examine
personal
effects
in
the
library
and
accordingly
craig
ransacked
the
desk
and
the
there
was
practically
nothing
to
be
discovered
had
morowitch
ever
received
any
threats
of
robbery
asked
craig
as
he
stood
before
the
desk
not
that
i
know
of
replied
morowitch
of
course
every
jeweller
who
carries
a
large
stock
of
diamonds
must
be
careful
but
i
do
think
my
husband
had
any
special
reason
to
fear
robbery
at
least
he
never
said
anything
about
it
why
do
you
ask
oh
nothing
i
merely
thought
there
might
be
some
hint
as
to
the
motives
of
the
robbery
said
craig
he
was
fingering
one
of
those
which
have
separate
leaves
for
each
day
with
blank
spaces
for
appointments
deal
poissan
he
read
slowly
from
one
of
the
entries
as
if
to
himself
that
strange
it
was
the
correspondence
under
the
letter
that
was
destroyed
at
the
office
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
here
either
who
was
poissan
morowitch
hesitated
either
from
ignorance
or
from
a
desire
to
evade
the
question
a
chemist
i
think
she
said
doubtfully
my
husband
had
some
dealings
with
him
some
discovery
he
was
going
to
buy
i
do
know
anything
about
it
i
thought
the
deal
was
the
deal
really
kennedy
you
had
better
ask
kahan
my
husband
talked
very
little
to
me
about
business
but
what
was
the
discovery
i
do
know
i
only
heard
morowitch
and
kahan
refer
to
some
deal
about
a
discovery
regarding
then
kahan
knows
about
it
i
presume
thank
you
morowitch
said
kennedy
when
it
was
evident
that
she
either
could
not
or
would
not
add
anything
to
what
she
had
said
pardon
us
for
causing
all
this
no
trouble
at
all
she
replied
graciously
though
i
could
see
she
was
intent
on
every
word
and
motion
of
kennedy
and
andrews
kennedy
stopped
the
car
at
a
a
few
blocks
away
and
asked
for
the
business
telephone
directory
in
an
instant
under
chemists
he
put
his
finger
on
the
name
of
poissan
henri
poissan
electric
furnaces
william
he
read
i
shall
visit
him
morning
now
for
the
doctor
thornton
was
an
excellent
specimen
of
the
genus
physician
to
the
wealthy
polished
cool
suave
one
of
andrews
men
as
i
have
said
had
seen
him
already
but
the
interview
had
been
very
unsatisfactory
evidently
however
the
doctor
had
been
turning
something
over
in
his
mind
since
then
and
had
thought
better
of
it
at
any
rate
his
manner
was
cordial
enough
now
as
he
closed
the
doors
to
his
office
he
began
to
pace
the
floor
mr
andrews
he
said
i
am
in
some
doubt
whether
i
had
better
tell
you
or
the
coroner
what
i
know
there
are
certain
professional
secrets
that
a
doctor
must
as
a
duty
to
his
patients
conceal
that
is
professional
ethics
but
there
are
also
cases
when
as
a
matter
of
public
policy
a
doctor
should
speak
he
stopped
and
faced
us
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
i
dislike
the
publicity
that
would
attend
any
statement
i
might
make
to
the
exactly
said
andrews
i
appreciate
your
position
exactly
your
other
patients
would
not
care
to
see
you
involved
in
a
scandal
or
at
least
you
would
not
care
to
have
them
see
you
so
involved
with
all
the
newspaper
notoriety
such
a
thing
doctor
thornton
shot
a
quick
glance
at
andrews
as
if
he
would
like
to
know
just
how
much
his
visitor
knew
or
suspected
andrews
drew
a
paper
from
his
pocket
this
is
a
copy
of
the
he
said
the
board
of
health
has
furnished
it
to
us
our
physicians
at
the
insurance
company
tell
me
it
is
rather
extraordinarily
vague
a
word
from
us
calling
the
attention
of
the
proper
authorities
to
it
would
be
sufficient
i
think
but
doctor
that
is
just
the
point
we
do
not
desire
publicity
any
more
than
you
do
we
could
have
the
body
of
morowitch
exhumed
and
examined
but
i
prefer
to
get
the
facts
in
the
case
without
resorting
to
such
extreme
it
would
do
no
good
interrupted
the
doctor
hastily
and
if
save
me
the
publicity
i
tell
you
andrews
nodded
but
still
held
the
where
the
doctor
was
constantly
reminded
of
it
in
that
certificate
i
have
put
down
the
cause
of
death
as
congestion
of
the
lungs
due
to
an
acute
attack
of
pneumonia
that
is
substantially
correct
as
far
as
it
goes
when
i
was
summoned
to
see
morowitch
i
found
him
in
a
semiconscious
state
and
scarcely
breathing
morowitch
told
me
that
he
had
been
brought
home
in
a
taxicab
by
a
man
who
had
picked
him
up
on
william
street
i
frank
to
say
that
at
first
sight
i
thought
it
was
a
case
of
plain
intoxication
for
morowitch
sometimes
indulged
a
little
freely
when
he
made
a
splendid
deal
i
smelled
his
breath
which
was
very
feeble
it
had
a
sickish
sweet
odour
but
that
did
not
impress
me
at
the
time
i
applied
my
stethoscope
to
his
lungs
there
was
a
very
marked
congestion
and
i
made
as
my
working
diagnosis
pneumonia
it
was
a
case
for
quick
and
heroic
action
in
a
very
few
minutes
i
had
a
tank
of
oxygen
from
the
hospital
in
the
meantime
i
had
thought
over
that
sweetish
odour
and
it
flashed
on
my
mind
that
it
might
after
all
be
a
case
of
poisoning
when
the
oxygen
arrived
i
administered
it
at
once
as
it
happens
the
rockefeller
institute
has
just
published
a
report
of
experiments
with
a
new
antidote
for
various
poisons
which
consists
simply
in
a
new
method
of
enforced
breathing
and
throwing
off
the
poison
by
oxidising
it
in
that
way
in
either
case
the
pneumonia
theory
or
the
poison
theory
this
line
of
action
was
the
best
that
i
could
have
adopted
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
i
gave
him
some
strychnine
to
strengthen
his
heart
and
by
hard
work
i
had
him
resting
apparently
a
little
easier
a
nurse
had
been
sent
for
but
had
not
arrived
when
a
messenger
came
to
me
telling
of
a
very
sudden
illness
of
morey
the
wife
of
the
as
the
morey
home
is
only
a
away
i
left
morowitch
with
very
particular
instructions
to
his
wife
as
to
what
to
do
i
had
intended
to
return
immediately
but
before
i
got
back
morowitch
was
dead
now
i
think
i
told
you
all
you
see
it
was
nothing
but
a
suspicion
hardly
enough
to
warrant
making
a
fuss
about
i
made
out
the
as
you
see
probably
that
would
have
been
all
there
was
to
it
if
i
had
heard
of
this
incomprehensible
robbery
that
set
me
thinking
again
there
i
glad
i
got
it
out
of
my
system
i
thought
about
it
a
good
deal
since
your
man
was
here
to
see
what
do
you
suspect
was
the
cause
of
that
sweetish
odour
asked
kennedy
the
doctor
hesitated
mind
it
is
only
a
suspicion
cyanide
of
potassium
or
cyanogen
gas
either
would
give
such
an
your
treatment
would
have
been
just
the
same
had
you
been
certain
practically
the
same
the
rockefeller
could
it
have
been
suicide
asked
andrews
there
was
no
motive
for
it
i
believe
replied
the
doctor
but
was
there
any
such
poison
in
the
morowitch
house
i
know
that
they
were
much
interested
in
photography
cyanide
of
potassium
is
used
in
certain
processes
in
who
was
interested
in
photography
or
morowitch
both
of
was
morowitch
both
of
them
repeated
the
doctor
hastily
it
was
evident
how
andrews
questions
were
tending
and
it
was
also
evident
that
the
doctor
did
not
wish
to
commit
himself
or
even
to
be
misunderstood
kennedy
had
sat
silently
for
some
minutes
turning
the
thing
over
in
his
mind
apparently
disregarding
andrews
entirely
he
now
asked
doctor
supposing
it
had
been
cyanogen
gas
which
caused
the
congestion
of
the
lungs
and
supposing
it
had
not
been
inhaled
in
quantities
large
enough
to
kill
outright
do
you
nevertheless
feel
that
morowitch
was
in
a
weak
enough
condition
to
die
as
a
result
of
the
congestion
produced
by
the
gas
after
the
traces
of
the
cyanogen
had
been
perhaps
thrown
off
that
is
precisely
the
impression
which
i
wished
to
might
i
ask
whether
in
his
semiconscious
state
he
said
anything
that
might
at
all
serve
as
a
clue
he
talked
ramblingly
incoherently
as
near
as
i
can
remember
it
he
seemed
to
believe
himself
to
have
become
a
millionaire
a
billionaire
he
talked
of
diamonds
diamonds
diamonds
he
seemed
to
be
picking
them
up
running
his
fingers
through
them
and
once
i
remember
he
seemed
to
want
to
send
for
kahan
and
tell
him
something
can
make
them
kahan
he
said
finest
the
largest
the
whitest
i
can
make
them
kennedy
was
all
attention
as
thornton
added
this
new
evidence
you
know
concluded
the
doctor
that
in
cyanogen
poisoning
there
might
be
hallucinations
of
the
wildest
kind
but
then
too
in
the
delirium
of
pneumonia
it
might
be
the
i
could
see
by
the
way
kennedy
acted
that
for
the
first
time
a
ray
of
light
had
dawned
upon
him
in
tracing
out
the
case
as
we
rose
to
go
the
doctor
shook
hands
with
us
his
last
words
were
said
with
an
air
of
great
relief
gentlemen
i
have
eased
my
conscience
as
we
parted
for
the
night
kennedy
faced
andrews
you
recall
that
you
promised
me
one
thing
when
i
took
up
this
case
he
asked
andrews
nodded
then
take
no
steps
until
i
tell
you
shadow
morowitch
and
kahan
but
do
not
let
them
know
you
suspect
them
of
anything
let
me
run
down
this
poissan
clue
in
other
words
leave
the
case
entirely
in
my
hands
in
other
respects
let
me
know
any
new
facts
you
may
unearth
and
some
time
i
shall
call
on
you
and
we
will
determine
what
the
next
step
is
to
be
good
night
i
want
to
thank
you
for
putting
me
in
the
way
of
this
case
i
think
we
shall
all
be
surprised
at
the
it
was
late
the
following
afternoon
before
i
saw
kennedy
again
he
was
in
his
laboratory
winding
two
strands
of
platinum
wire
carefully
about
a
piece
of
porcelain
and
smearing
on
it
some
peculiar
black
glassy
granular
substance
that
came
in
a
sort
of
pencil
like
a
stick
of
i
noticed
that
he
was
very
particular
to
keep
the
two
wires
exactly
the
same
distance
from
each
other
throughout
the
entire
length
of
the
piece
of
porcelain
but
i
said
nothing
to
distract
his
attention
though
a
thousand
questions
about
the
progress
of
the
case
were
at
my
tongue
end
instead
i
watched
him
intently
the
black
substance
formed
a
sort
of
bridge
connecting
and
covering
the
wires
when
he
had
finished
he
said
now
you
can
ask
me
your
questions
while
i
heat
and
anneal
this
little
contrivance
i
see
you
are
bursting
with
well
did
you
see
poissan
i
asked
kennedy
continued
to
heat
the
porcelain
i
did
and
he
is
going
to
give
me
a
demonstration
of
his
discovery
his
discovery
you
remember
morowitch
as
the
doctor
called
it
that
was
no
hallucination
that
was
a
reality
this
man
poissan
says
he
has
discovered
a
way
to
make
diamonds
artificially
out
of
pure
carbon
in
an
electric
furnace
morowitch
i
believe
was
to
buy
his
secret
his
dream
of
millions
was
a
reality
at
least
to
and
did
kahan
and
morowitch
know
it
i
asked
quickly
i
do
know
yet
replied
craig
finishing
the
annealing
the
black
glassy
substance
was
now
a
dull
grey
what
that
stuff
you
were
putting
on
the
wire
i
asked
oh
just
a
made
in
the
manufacture
of
sulphuric
acid
answered
kennedy
airily
adding
as
if
to
change
the
subject
i
want
you
to
go
with
me
i
told
poissan
i
was
a
professor
in
the
university
and
that
i
would
bring
one
of
our
younger
trustees
the
son
of
the
banker
pierpont
spencer
who
might
put
some
capital
into
his
scheme
now
jameson
while
i
finishing
up
my
work
here
run
over
to
the
apartment
and
get
my
automatic
revolver
i
may
need
it
i
have
communicated
with
andrews
and
he
will
be
ready
the
demonstration
will
take
place
at
at
poissan
laboratory
i
tried
to
get
him
to
give
it
here
but
he
absolutely
half
an
hour
later
i
rejoined
craig
at
his
laboratory
and
we
rode
down
to
the
great
eastern
life
building
andrews
was
waiting
for
us
in
his
solidly
furnished
office
outside
i
noted
a
couple
of
husky
men
who
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
orders
from
their
chief
from
the
manner
in
which
the
greeted
us
it
was
evident
that
he
was
keenly
interested
in
what
kennedy
was
about
to
do
so
you
think
morowitch
deal
was
a
deal
to
purchase
the
secret
of
he
mused
i
feel
sure
of
it
replied
craig
i
felt
sure
of
it
the
moment
i
looked
up
poissan
and
found
that
he
was
a
manufacturer
of
electric
furnaces
do
you
remember
the
famous
lemoine
case
in
london
and
paris
yes
but
lemoine
was
a
fakir
of
the
first
water
said
andrews
do
you
think
this
man
is
too
that
what
i
going
to
find
out
before
i
take
another
step
said
craig
of
course
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
by
proper
use
the
electric
furnace
will
make
small
almost
microscopic
diamonds
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
suppose
that
some
day
someone
will
be
able
to
make
large
diamonds
synthetically
by
the
same
maybe
this
man
has
done
it
agreed
andrews
who
knows
i
wager
that
if
he
has
and
that
if
morowitch
had
bought
an
interest
in
his
process
kahan
knew
of
it
he
a
sharp
one
and
morowitch
let
grass
grow
under
her
feet
when
it
comes
to
seeing
the
main
chance
as
to
money
now
just
supposing
morowitch
had
bought
an
interest
in
a
secret
like
that
and
supposing
kahan
was
in
love
with
morowitch
and
that
they
let
us
suppose
nothing
andrews
interrupted
kennedy
at
least
not
yet
let
me
see
it
is
now
ten
minutes
after
eight
poissan
place
is
only
a
few
blocks
from
here
i
like
to
get
there
a
few
minutes
early
let
as
we
left
the
office
andrews
signalled
to
the
two
men
outside
and
they
quietly
followed
a
few
feet
in
the
rear
but
without
seeming
to
be
with
us
poissan
laboratory
was
at
the
top
of
a
sort
of
loft
building
a
dozen
stories
or
so
high
it
was
a
peculiar
building
with
several
entrances
besides
a
freight
elevator
at
the
rear
and
that
led
to
adjoining
lower
roofs
we
stopped
around
the
corner
in
the
shadow
and
kennedy
and
andrews
talked
earnestly
as
near
as
i
could
make
out
kennedy
was
insisting
that
it
would
be
best
for
andrews
and
his
men
not
to
enter
the
building
at
all
but
wait
while
he
and
i
went
up
at
last
the
arrangement
was
agreed
on
here
said
kennedy
undoing
a
package
he
had
carried
is
a
little
electric
bell
with
a
couple
of
fresh
dry
batteries
attached
to
it
and
wires
that
will
reach
at
least
four
hundred
feet
you
and
the
men
wait
in
the
shadow
here
by
this
side
entrance
for
five
minutes
after
jameson
and
i
go
up
then
you
must
engage
the
night
watchman
in
some
way
while
he
is
away
you
will
find
two
wires
dangling
down
the
elevator
shaft
attach
them
to
these
wires
from
the
bell
and
the
batteries
these
two
you
know
how
to
do
that
the
wires
will
be
hanging
in
the
third
shaft
only
one
elevator
is
running
at
night
the
first
the
moment
you
hear
the
bell
begin
to
ring
jump
into
the
elevator
and
come
up
to
the
twelfth
floor
we
need
as
kennedy
and
i
rode
up
in
the
elevator
i
could
not
help
thinking
what
an
ideal
place
a
office
building
is
for
committing
a
crime
even
at
this
early
hour
of
the
evening
if
the
streets
were
deserted
the
were
positively
uncanny
in
their
grim
black
silence
with
only
here
and
there
a
light
the
elevator
in
the
first
shaft
shot
down
again
to
the
ground
floor
and
as
it
disappeared
kennedy
took
two
spools
of
wire
from
his
pocket
and
hastily
shoved
them
through
the
lattice
work
the
third
elevator
shaft
they
quickly
unrolled
and
i
could
hear
them
strike
the
top
of
the
empty
car
below
in
the
basement
that
meant
that
andrews
on
the
ground
floor
could
reach
the
wires
and
attach
them
to
the
bell
quickly
in
the
darkness
kennedy
attached
the
ends
of
the
wires
to
the
curious
little
coil
i
had
seen
him
working
on
in
the
laboratory
and
we
proceeded
down
the
hall
to
the
rooms
occupied
by
poissan
kennedy
had
allowed
for
the
wire
to
reach
from
the
up
this
hall
also
and
as
he
walked
he
paid
it
out
in
such
a
manner
that
it
fell
on
the
floor
close
to
the
wall
where
in
the
darkness
it
would
never
be
noticed
or
stumbled
over
around
an
l
in
the
hall
i
could
see
a
window
with
a
light
shining
through
it
kennedy
stopped
at
the
window
and
quickly
placed
the
little
coil
on
the
ledge
close
up
against
the
glass
with
the
wires
running
from
it
down
the
hall
then
we
entered
on
time
to
the
minute
professor
exclaimed
poissan
snapping
his
watch
and
this
i
presume
is
the
banker
who
is
interested
in
my
great
discovery
of
making
artificial
diamonds
of
any
size
or
colour
he
added
indicating
me
yes
answered
craig
as
i
told
you
a
son
of
pierpont
i
shook
hands
with
as
much
dignity
as
i
could
assume
for
the
role
of
impersonation
was
a
new
one
to
me
kennedy
carelessly
laid
his
coat
and
hat
on
the
inside
ledge
of
the
window
just
opposite
the
spot
where
he
had
placed
the
little
coil
on
the
other
side
of
the
glass
i
noted
that
the
window
was
simply
a
large
pane
of
set
in
the
wall
for
the
purpose
of
admitting
light
in
the
daytime
from
the
hall
outside
the
whole
thing
seemed
eerie
to
me
especially
as
poissan
assistant
was
a
huge
fellow
and
had
an
evil
look
such
as
i
had
seen
in
pictures
of
the
inhabitants
of
quarters
of
paris
which
one
does
not
frequent
except
in
the
company
of
a
safe
guide
i
was
glad
kennedy
had
brought
his
revolver
and
rather
vexed
that
he
had
not
told
me
to
do
likewise
however
i
trusted
that
craig
knew
what
he
was
about
we
seated
ourselves
some
distance
from
a
table
on
which
was
a
huge
plain
oblong
contrivance
that
reminded
me
of
the
diagram
of
a
parallelopiped
which
had
caused
so
much
trouble
in
my
solid
geometry
at
college
that
the
electric
furnace
sir
said
craig
to
me
with
an
assumed
deference
becoming
a
college
professor
explaining
things
to
the
son
of
a
great
financier
you
see
the
electrodes
at
either
end
when
the
current
is
turned
on
and
led
through
them
into
the
furnace
you
can
get
the
most
amazing
temperatures
in
the
crucible
the
most
refractory
of
chemical
compounds
can
be
broken
up
by
that
heat
what
is
the
highest
temperature
you
have
attained
professor
something
over
three
thousand
degrees
centigrade
replied
poissan
as
he
and
his
assistant
busied
themselves
about
the
furnace
we
sat
watching
him
in
silence
ah
gentlemen
now
i
am
ready
he
exclaimed
at
length
when
everything
was
arranged
to
his
satisfaction
you
see
here
is
a
lump
of
sugar
carbon
pure
amorphous
carbon
diamonds
as
you
know
are
composed
of
pure
carbon
crystallised
under
enormous
pressure
now
my
theory
is
that
if
we
can
combine
an
enormous
pressure
and
an
enormous
heat
we
can
make
diamonds
artificially
the
problem
of
pressure
is
the
thing
for
here
in
the
furnace
we
have
the
necessary
heat
it
occurred
to
me
that
when
molten
cast
iron
cools
it
exerts
a
tremendous
pressure
that
pressure
is
what
i
you
know
spencer
solid
iron
floats
on
molten
iron
like
solid
water
ice
floats
on
liquid
water
explained
craig
to
me
poissan
nodded
i
take
this
sugar
carbon
and
place
it
in
this
soft
iron
cup
then
i
screw
on
this
cap
over
the
cup
so
now
i
place
this
mass
of
iron
scraps
in
the
crucible
of
the
furnace
and
start
the
he
turned
a
switch
and
long
sheets
of
flame
spurted
out
from
the
electrodes
on
either
side
it
was
weird
gruesome
one
could
feel
the
heat
of
the
tremendous
electric
discharge
as
i
looked
at
the
flames
they
gradually
changed
to
a
beautiful
purple
and
a
sickish
sweet
odour
filled
the
room
the
furnace
roared
at
first
but
as
the
vapors
increased
it
became
a
better
conductor
of
the
electricity
and
the
roaring
ceased
in
almost
no
time
the
mass
of
iron
scraps
became
molten
suddenly
poissan
plunged
the
cup
into
the
seething
mass
the
cup
floated
and
quickly
began
to
melt
as
it
did
so
he
waited
attentively
until
the
proper
moment
then
with
a
deft
motion
he
seized
the
whole
thing
with
a
long
pair
of
tongs
and
plunged
it
into
a
vat
of
running
water
a
huge
cloud
of
steam
filled
the
room
i
felt
a
drowsy
sensation
stealing
over
me
as
the
sickish
sweet
smell
from
the
furnace
increased
gripping
the
chair
i
roused
myself
and
watched
poissan
attentively
he
was
working
rapidly
as
the
molten
mass
cooled
and
solidified
he
took
it
out
of
the
water
and
laid
it
on
an
anvil
then
his
assistant
began
to
hammer
it
with
careful
sharp
blows
chipping
off
the
outside
you
see
we
have
to
get
down
to
the
core
of
carbon
gently
he
said
as
he
picked
up
the
little
pieces
of
iron
and
threw
them
into
a
first
rather
brittle
cast
iron
then
hard
iron
then
iron
and
carbon
then
some
black
diamonds
and
in
the
very
centre
the
diamonds
ah
we
are
getting
to
them
here
is
a
small
diamond
see
spencer
gently
francois
we
shall
come
to
the
large
ones
one
moment
professor
poissan
interrupted
craig
let
your
assistant
break
them
out
while
i
stand
over
impossible
you
would
not
know
when
you
saw
them
they
are
just
rough
oh
yes
i
no
stay
where
you
are
unless
i
attend
to
it
the
diamonds
might
be
there
was
something
peculiar
about
his
insistence
but
after
he
picked
out
the
next
diamond
i
was
hardly
prepared
for
kennedy
next
remark
let
me
see
the
palms
of
your
poissan
shot
an
angry
glance
at
kennedy
but
he
did
not
open
his
hands
i
merely
wish
to
convince
you
spencer
said
kennedy
to
me
that
it
is
no
trick
and
that
the
professor
has
not
several
uncut
stones
palmed
in
his
hand
like
a
the
frenchman
faced
us
his
face
livid
with
rage
you
call
me
a
prestidigitator
a
fraud
you
shall
suffer
for
that
sacrebleu
ventre
du
saint
gris
no
man
ever
insults
the
honour
of
poissan
francois
water
on
the
electrodes
the
assistant
dashed
a
few
drops
of
water
on
the
electrodes
the
sickish
odour
increased
tremendously
i
felt
myself
almost
going
but
with
an
effort
i
again
roused
myself
i
wondered
how
craig
stood
the
fumes
for
i
suffered
an
intense
headache
and
nausea
stop
craig
thundered
there
enough
cyanogen
in
this
room
already
i
know
your
game
the
water
forms
acetylene
with
the
carbon
and
that
uniting
with
the
nitrogen
of
the
air
under
the
terrific
heat
of
the
electric
arc
forms
hydrocyanic
acid
would
you
poison
us
too
do
you
think
you
can
put
me
unconscious
out
on
the
street
and
have
a
society
doctor
diagnose
my
case
as
pneumonia
or
do
you
think
we
shall
die
quietly
in
some
hospital
as
a
certain
new
york
banker
did
last
year
after
he
had
watched
an
alchemist
make
silver
out
of
apparently
nothing
the
effect
on
poissan
was
terrible
he
advanced
toward
kennedy
the
veins
in
his
face
fairly
standing
out
shaking
his
forefinger
he
shouted
you
know
that
do
you
you
are
no
professor
and
this
is
no
banker
you
are
spies
spies
you
come
from
the
friends
of
morowitch
do
you
you
have
gone
too
far
with
kennedy
said
nothing
but
retreated
and
took
his
coat
and
hat
off
the
window
ledge
the
hideous
penetrating
light
of
the
tongues
of
flame
from
the
furnace
played
on
the
window
poissan
laughed
a
hollow
laugh
put
down
your
hat
and
coat
mistair
kennedy
he
hissed
the
door
has
been
locked
ever
since
you
have
been
here
those
windows
are
barred
the
telephone
wire
is
cut
and
it
is
three
hundred
feet
to
the
street
we
shall
leave
you
here
when
the
fumes
have
overcome
you
francois
and
i
can
stand
them
up
to
a
point
and
when
we
reach
that
point
we
are
instead
of
being
cowed
kennedy
grew
bolder
though
i
for
my
part
felt
so
weakened
that
i
feared
the
outcome
of
a
encounter
with
either
poissan
or
francois
who
appeared
as
fresh
as
if
nothing
had
happened
they
were
hurriedly
preparing
to
leave
us
that
would
do
you
no
good
kennedy
rejoined
for
we
have
no
safe
full
of
jewels
for
you
to
rob
there
are
no
keys
to
offices
to
be
stolen
from
our
pockets
and
let
me
tell
you
you
are
not
the
only
man
in
new
york
who
knows
the
secret
of
thermite
i
have
told
the
secret
to
the
police
and
they
are
only
waiting
to
find
who
destroyed
correspondence
under
the
letter
to
apprehend
the
robber
of
his
safe
your
secret
is
revenge
revenge
poissan
cried
i
will
have
revenge
francois
bring
out
the
jewels
ha
ha
here
in
this
bag
are
the
jewels
of
morowitch
francois
and
i
will
go
down
by
the
back
elevator
to
a
secret
exit
in
two
hours
all
your
police
in
new
york
can
not
find
us
but
in
two
hours
you
two
impostors
will
be
suffocated
perhaps
you
will
die
of
cyanogen
like
morowitch
whose
jewels
i
have
at
he
went
to
the
door
into
the
hall
and
stood
there
with
a
mocking
laugh
i
moved
to
make
a
rush
toward
them
but
kennedy
raised
his
hand
you
will
suffocate
poissan
hissed
again
just
then
we
heard
the
elevator
door
clang
and
hurried
steps
came
down
the
long
hall
craig
whipped
out
his
automatic
and
began
pumping
the
bullets
out
in
rapid
succession
as
the
smoke
cleared
i
expected
to
see
poissan
and
francois
lying
on
the
floor
instead
craig
had
fired
at
the
lock
of
the
door
he
had
shattered
it
into
a
thousand
bits
andrews
and
his
men
were
running
down
the
hall
curse
you
muttered
poissan
as
he
banged
the
now
useless
lock
who
let
those
fellows
in
are
you
a
wizard
craig
smiled
coolly
as
the
ventilation
cleared
the
room
of
the
deadly
cyanogen
on
the
outside
is
a
selenium
cell
selenium
is
a
bad
conductor
of
electricity
in
the
dark
and
an
excellent
conductor
when
exposed
to
light
i
merely
moved
my
coat
and
hat
and
the
light
from
the
furnace
which
was
going
to
suffocate
us
played
through
the
glass
on
the
cell
the
circuit
was
completed
without
your
suspecting
that
i
could
communicate
with
friends
outside
a
bell
was
rung
on
the
street
and
here
they
are
andrews
there
is
the
murderer
of
morowitch
and
there
in
his
hands
are
the
morowitch
poissan
had
moved
toward
the
furnace
with
a
quick
motion
he
seized
the
long
tongs
there
was
a
cloud
of
choking
vapour
kennedy
leaped
to
the
switch
and
shut
off
the
current
with
the
tongs
he
lifted
out
a
shapeless
piece
of
valueless
black
graphite
all
that
is
left
of
the
priceless
morowitch
jewels
he
exclaimed
ruefully
but
we
have
the
and
a
certified
check
for
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
goes
to
morowitch
with
my
humblest
apologies
and
sympathy
added
andrews
professor
kennedy
you
have
earned
your
vii
the
azure
ring
files
of
newspapers
and
innumerable
clippings
from
the
press
bureaus
littered
kennedy
desk
in
rank
profusion
kennedy
himself
was
so
deeply
absorbed
that
i
had
merely
said
good
evening
as
i
came
in
and
had
started
to
open
my
mail
with
an
impatient
sweep
of
his
hand
however
he
brushed
the
whole
mass
of
newspapers
into
the
it
seems
to
me
walter
he
exclaimed
in
disgust
that
this
mystery
is
considered
insoluble
for
the
very
reason
which
should
make
it
easy
to
solve
the
extraordinary
character
of
its
inasmuch
as
he
had
opened
the
subject
i
laid
down
the
letter
i
was
reading
i
wager
i
can
tell
you
just
why
you
made
that
remark
craig
i
ventured
you
reading
up
on
that
you
are
on
the
road
to
becoming
a
detective
yourself
walter
he
answered
with
a
touch
of
sarcasm
your
ability
to
add
two
units
to
two
other
units
and
obtain
four
units
is
almost
worthy
of
inspector
you
are
right
and
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
district
attorney
of
westchester
county
will
be
here
he
telephoned
me
this
afternoon
and
sent
an
assistant
with
this
mass
of
dope
i
suppose
want
it
back
he
added
fishing
the
newspapers
out
of
the
basket
again
but
with
all
due
respect
to
your
profession
i
say
that
no
one
would
ever
get
on
speaking
terms
with
the
solution
of
this
case
if
he
had
to
depend
solely
on
the
newspaper
no
i
queried
rather
nettled
at
his
tone
no
he
repeated
emphatically
here
one
of
the
most
popular
girls
in
the
fashionable
suburb
of
williston
and
one
of
the
leading
younger
members
of
the
bar
in
new
york
engaged
to
be
married
are
found
dead
in
the
library
of
the
girl
home
the
day
before
the
ceremony
and
now
a
week
later
no
one
knows
whether
it
was
an
accident
due
to
the
fumes
from
the
antique
or
whether
it
was
a
double
suicide
or
suicide
and
murder
or
a
double
murder
or
or
why
the
experts
have
even
been
able
to
agree
on
whether
they
have
discovered
poison
or
not
he
continued
growing
as
excited
as
the
city
editor
did
over
my
first
attempt
as
a
cub
reporter
they
have
agreed
on
anything
except
that
on
the
eve
of
what
was
presumably
to
have
been
the
happiest
day
of
their
lives
two
of
the
best
known
members
of
the
younger
set
are
found
dead
while
absolutely
no
one
as
far
as
is
known
can
be
proved
to
have
been
near
them
within
the
time
necessary
to
murder
them
no
wonder
the
coroner
says
it
is
simply
a
case
of
asphyxiation
no
wonder
the
district
attorney
is
at
his
end
you
fellows
have
hounded
them
with
your
hypotheses
until
they
see
the
facts
straight
you
suggest
one
solution
and
the
sounded
insistently
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
a
tall
spare
individual
stalked
in
and
laid
a
green
bag
on
the
table
good
evening
professor
kennedy
he
began
brusquely
i
am
district
attorney
whitney
of
westchester
i
see
you
have
been
reading
up
on
the
case
quite
quite
wrong
answered
craig
let
me
introduce
my
friend
jameson
of
the
star
sit
down
jameson
knows
what
i
think
of
the
way
the
newspapers
have
handled
this
case
i
was
about
to
tell
him
as
you
came
in
that
i
intended
to
disregard
everything
that
had
been
printed
to
start
out
with
you
as
if
it
were
a
fresh
subject
and
get
the
facts
at
first
hand
let
get
right
down
to
business
first
tell
us
just
how
it
was
that
miss
wainwright
and
templeton
were
discovered
and
by
the
district
attorney
loosened
the
cords
of
the
green
bag
and
drew
out
a
bundle
of
documents
i
read
you
the
affidavit
of
the
maid
who
found
them
he
said
fingering
the
documents
nervously
you
see
john
templeton
had
left
his
office
in
new
york
early
that
afternoon
telling
his
father
that
he
was
going
to
visit
miss
wainwright
he
caught
the
train
reached
williston
all
right
walked
to
the
wainwright
house
and
in
spite
of
the
bustle
of
preparation
for
the
wedding
the
next
day
he
spent
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
with
miss
wainwright
that
where
the
mystery
begins
they
had
no
visitors
at
least
the
maid
who
answers
the
bell
says
they
had
none
she
was
busy
with
the
rest
of
the
family
and
i
believe
the
front
door
was
not
locked
we
do
lock
our
doors
in
williston
except
at
he
had
found
the
paper
and
paused
to
impress
these
facts
on
our
minds
mrs
wainwright
and
miss
marian
wainwright
the
sister
were
busy
about
the
house
wainwright
wished
to
consult
laura
about
something
she
summoned
the
maid
and
asked
if
templeton
and
miss
wainwright
were
in
the
house
the
maid
replied
that
she
would
see
and
this
is
her
affidavit
ahem
i
skip
the
legal
part
knocked
at
the
library
door
twice
but
obtaining
no
answer
i
supposed
they
had
gone
out
for
a
walk
or
perhaps
a
ride
across
country
as
they
often
did
i
opened
the
door
partly
and
looked
in
there
was
a
silence
in
the
room
a
strange
queer
silence
i
opened
the
door
further
and
looking
toward
the
davenport
in
the
corner
i
saw
miss
laura
and
templeton
in
such
an
awkward
position
they
looked
as
if
they
had
fallen
asleep
his
head
was
thrown
back
against
the
cushions
of
the
davenport
and
on
his
face
was
a
most
awful
look
it
was
discoloured
her
head
had
fallen
forward
on
his
shoulder
sideways
and
on
her
face
too
was
the
same
terrible
stare
and
the
same
discolouration
their
right
hands
were
tightly
clasped
called
to
them
they
did
not
answer
then
the
horrible
truth
flashed
on
me
they
were
dead
i
felt
giddy
for
a
minute
but
quickly
recovered
myself
and
with
a
cry
for
help
i
rushed
to
wainwright
room
shrieking
that
they
were
dead
wainwright
fainted
miss
marian
called
the
doctor
on
the
telephone
and
helped
us
restore
her
mother
she
seemed
perfectly
cool
in
the
tragedy
and
i
do
not
know
what
we
servants
should
have
done
if
she
had
not
been
there
to
direct
us
the
house
was
frantic
and
wainwright
was
not
at
home
did
not
detect
any
odour
when
i
opened
the
library
door
no
glasses
or
bottles
or
vials
or
other
receptacles
which
could
have
held
poison
were
discovered
or
removed
by
me
or
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
and
belief
by
anyone
else
what
happened
next
asked
craig
eagerly
the
family
physician
arrived
and
sent
for
the
coroner
immediately
and
later
for
myself
you
see
he
thought
at
once
of
but
the
coroner
i
understand
thinks
differently
prompted
kennedy
yes
the
coroner
has
declared
the
case
to
be
accidental
he
says
that
the
weight
of
evidence
points
positively
to
asphyxiation
still
how
can
it
be
asphyxiation
they
could
have
escaped
from
the
room
at
any
time
the
door
was
not
locked
i
tell
you
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
tests
for
poison
in
their
mouths
stomachs
and
blood
have
so
far
revealed
nothing
i
still
believe
that
john
templeton
and
laura
wainwright
were
kennedy
looked
at
his
watch
thoughtfully
you
have
told
me
just
enough
to
make
me
want
to
see
the
coroner
himself
he
mused
if
we
take
the
next
train
out
to
williston
with
you
will
you
engage
to
get
us
a
talk
with
him
on
the
case
whitney
surely
but
we
have
to
start
right
away
i
finished
my
other
business
in
new
york
inspector
ah
i
see
you
know
him
has
promised
to
secure
the
attendance
of
anyone
whom
i
can
show
to
be
a
material
witness
in
the
case
come
on
gentlemen
i
answer
your
other
questions
on
the
as
we
settled
ourselves
in
the
smoker
whitney
remarked
in
a
low
voice
you
know
someone
has
said
that
there
is
only
one
thing
more
difficult
to
investigate
and
solve
than
a
crime
whose
commission
is
surrounded
by
complicated
circumstances
and
that
is
a
crime
whose
perpetration
is
wholly
devoid
of
are
you
so
sure
that
this
crime
is
wholly
devoid
of
circumstances
asked
craig
professor
he
replied
i
not
sure
of
anything
in
this
case
if
i
were
i
should
not
require
your
assistance
i
would
like
the
credit
of
solving
it
myself
but
it
is
beyond
me
just
think
of
it
so
far
we
have
a
clue
at
least
none
that
shows
the
slightest
promise
although
we
have
worked
night
and
day
for
a
week
it
all
darkness
the
facts
are
so
simple
that
they
give
us
nothing
to
work
on
it
is
like
a
blank
sheet
of
kennedy
said
nothing
and
the
district
attorney
proceeded
i
blame
nott
the
coroner
for
thinking
it
an
accident
but
to
my
mind
some
master
criminal
must
have
arranged
this
very
baffling
simplicity
of
circumstances
you
recall
that
the
front
door
was
unlocked
this
person
must
have
entered
the
house
unobserved
not
a
difficult
thing
to
do
for
the
wainwright
house
is
somewhat
isolated
perhaps
this
person
brought
along
some
poison
in
the
form
of
a
beverage
and
induced
the
two
victims
to
drink
and
then
this
person
must
have
removed
the
evidences
as
swiftly
as
they
were
brought
in
and
by
the
same
door
that
i
think
is
the
only
that
is
not
the
only
solution
it
is
one
solution
interrupted
kennedy
quietly
do
you
think
someone
in
the
house
did
it
i
asked
quickly
i
think
replied
craig
carefully
measuring
his
words
that
if
poison
was
given
them
it
must
have
been
by
someone
they
both
knew
pretty
no
one
said
a
word
until
at
last
i
broke
the
silence
i
know
from
the
gossip
of
the
star
office
that
many
williston
people
say
that
marian
was
very
jealous
of
her
sister
laura
for
capturing
the
catch
of
the
season
williston
people
do
hesitate
to
hint
at
whitney
produced
another
document
from
that
fertile
green
bag
it
was
another
affidavit
he
handed
it
to
us
it
was
a
statement
signed
by
wainwright
and
read
before
god
my
daughter
marian
is
innocent
if
you
wish
to
find
out
all
find
out
more
about
the
past
history
of
templeton
before
he
became
engaged
to
laura
she
would
never
in
the
world
have
committed
suicide
she
was
too
bright
and
cheerful
for
that
even
if
templeton
had
been
about
to
break
off
the
engagement
my
daughters
laura
and
marian
were
always
treated
by
wainwright
and
myself
exactly
alike
of
course
they
had
their
quarrels
just
as
all
sisters
do
but
there
was
never
to
my
certain
knowledge
a
serious
disagreement
and
i
was
always
close
enough
to
my
girls
to
know
no
laura
was
murdered
by
someone
kennedy
did
not
seem
to
attach
much
importance
to
this
statement
let
us
see
he
began
reflectively
first
we
have
a
young
woman
especially
attractive
and
charming
in
both
person
and
temperament
she
is
just
about
to
be
married
and
if
the
reports
are
to
be
believed
there
was
no
cloud
on
her
happiness
secondly
we
have
a
young
man
whom
everyone
agrees
to
have
been
of
an
ardent
energetic
optimistic
temperament
he
had
everything
to
live
for
presumably
so
far
so
good
everyone
who
has
investigated
this
case
i
understand
has
tried
to
eliminate
the
and
the
theories
that
is
all
right
providing
the
facts
are
as
stated
we
shall
see
later
when
we
interview
the
coroner
now
whitney
suppose
you
tell
us
briefly
what
you
have
learned
about
the
past
history
of
the
two
unfortunate
well
the
wainwrights
are
an
old
westchester
family
not
very
wealthy
but
of
the
real
aristocracy
of
the
county
there
were
only
two
children
laura
and
marian
the
templetons
were
much
the
same
sort
of
family
the
children
all
attended
a
private
school
at
white
plains
and
there
also
they
met
schuyler
vanderdyke
these
four
constituted
a
sort
of
little
aristocracy
in
the
school
i
mention
this
because
vanderdyke
later
became
laura
first
husband
this
marriage
with
templeton
was
a
second
how
long
ago
was
she
divorced
asked
craig
attentively
about
three
years
ago
i
coming
to
that
in
a
moment
the
sisters
went
to
college
together
templeton
to
law
school
and
vanderdyke
studied
civil
engineering
their
intimacy
was
pretty
well
broken
up
all
except
laura
and
vanderdyke
soon
after
he
graduated
he
was
taken
into
the
construction
department
of
the
central
railroad
by
his
uncle
who
was
a
and
laura
and
he
were
married
as
far
as
i
can
learn
he
had
been
a
fellow
of
convivial
habits
at
college
and
about
two
years
after
their
marriage
his
wife
suddenly
became
aware
of
what
had
long
been
well
known
in
williston
that
vanderdyke
was
paying
marked
attention
to
a
woman
named
miss
laporte
in
new
york
no
sooner
had
laura
vanderdyke
learned
of
this
intimacy
of
her
husband
continued
whitney
than
she
quietly
hired
private
detectives
to
shadow
him
and
on
their
evidence
she
obtained
a
divorce
the
papers
were
sealed
and
she
resumed
her
maiden
name
as
far
as
i
can
find
out
vanderdyke
then
disappeared
from
her
life
he
resigned
his
position
with
the
railroad
and
joined
a
party
of
engineers
exploring
the
upper
amazon
later
he
went
to
venezuela
miss
laporte
also
went
to
south
america
about
the
same
time
and
was
for
a
time
in
venezuela
and
later
in
peru
vanderdyke
seems
to
have
dropped
all
his
early
associations
completely
though
at
present
i
find
he
is
back
in
new
york
raising
capital
for
a
company
to
exploit
a
new
asphalt
concession
in
the
interior
of
venezuela
miss
laporte
has
also
reappeared
in
new
york
as
ralston
with
a
mining
claim
in
the
mountains
of
and
templeton
asked
craig
had
he
had
any
previous
matrimonial
ventures
no
none
of
course
he
had
had
love
affairs
mostly
with
the
set
he
had
known
miss
laporte
pretty
well
too
while
he
was
in
law
school
in
new
york
but
when
he
settled
down
to
work
he
seems
to
have
forgotten
all
about
the
girls
for
a
couple
of
years
or
so
he
was
very
anxious
to
get
ahead
and
let
nothing
stand
in
his
way
he
was
admitted
to
the
bar
and
taken
in
by
his
father
as
junior
member
of
the
firm
of
templeton
mills
templeton
not
long
ago
he
was
appointed
a
special
master
to
take
testimony
in
the
prosecutions
and
i
happen
to
know
that
he
was
making
good
in
the
kennedy
nodded
what
sort
of
fellow
personally
was
templeton
he
asked
very
popular
replied
the
district
attorney
both
at
the
country
club
and
in
his
profession
in
new
york
he
was
a
fellow
of
naturally
commanding
temperament
the
templetons
were
always
that
way
i
doubt
if
many
young
men
even
with
his
chances
could
have
gained
such
a
reputation
at
as
his
socially
he
was
very
popular
too
a
great
catch
for
all
the
sly
mamas
of
the
country
club
who
had
marriageable
daughters
he
liked
automobiles
and
outdoor
sports
and
he
was
strong
in
politics
too
that
was
how
he
got
ahead
so
fast
well
to
cut
the
story
short
templeton
met
the
wainwright
girls
again
last
summer
at
a
resort
on
long
island
they
had
just
returned
from
a
long
trip
abroad
spending
most
of
the
time
in
the
far
east
with
their
father
whose
firm
has
business
interests
in
china
the
girls
were
very
attractive
they
rode
and
played
tennis
and
golf
better
than
most
of
the
men
and
this
fall
templeton
became
a
frequent
visitor
at
the
wainwright
home
in
williston
people
who
know
them
best
tell
me
that
his
first
attentions
were
paid
to
marian
a
very
dashing
and
ambitious
young
woman
nearly
every
day
templeton
car
stopped
at
the
house
and
the
girls
and
some
friend
of
templeton
in
the
country
club
went
for
a
ride
they
tell
me
that
at
this
time
marian
always
sat
with
templeton
on
the
front
seat
but
after
a
few
weeks
the
gossips
nothing
of
that
sort
ever
escapes
williston
said
that
the
occupant
of
the
front
seat
was
laura
she
often
drove
the
car
herself
and
was
very
clever
at
it
at
any
rate
not
long
after
that
the
engagement
was
as
he
walked
up
from
the
pretty
little
williston
station
kennedy
asked
one
more
question
whitney
how
did
marian
take
the
engagement
the
district
attorney
hesitated
i
will
be
perfectly
frank
kennedy
he
answered
the
people
tell
me
that
the
girls
were
very
cool
toward
each
other
that
was
why
i
got
that
statement
from
wainwright
i
wish
to
be
perfectly
fair
to
everyone
concerned
in
this
we
found
the
coroner
quite
willing
to
talk
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
hour
was
late
my
friend
whitney
here
still
holds
the
poison
theory
began
the
coroner
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
everything
points
absolutely
toward
asphyxiation
if
i
had
been
able
to
discover
the
slightest
trace
of
in
the
room
i
should
have
pronounced
it
asphyxia
at
once
all
the
symptoms
accorded
with
it
but
the
asphyxia
was
not
caused
by
escaping
there
was
an
antique
in
the
room
and
i
have
ascertained
that
it
was
lighted
now
anything
like
a
brazier
will
unless
there
is
proper
ventilation
give
rise
to
carbonic
oxide
or
carbon
monoxide
gas
which
is
always
present
in
the
products
of
combustion
often
to
the
extent
of
from
five
to
ten
per
cent
a
very
slight
quantity
of
this
gas
insufficient
even
to
cause
an
odour
in
a
room
will
give
a
severe
headache
and
a
case
is
recorded
where
a
whole
family
in
glasgow
was
poisoned
without
knowing
it
by
the
escape
of
this
gas
a
little
over
one
per
cent
of
it
in
the
atmosphere
is
fatal
if
breathed
for
any
length
of
time
you
know
it
is
a
product
of
combustion
and
is
very
deadly
it
is
the
white
damp
or
afterdamp
of
a
mine
explosion
i
going
to
tell
you
a
secret
which
i
have
not
given
out
to
the
press
yet
i
tried
an
experiment
in
a
closed
room
today
lighting
the
brazier
some
distance
from
it
i
placed
a
cat
confined
in
a
cage
so
it
could
not
escape
in
an
hour
and
a
half
the
cat
was
the
coroner
concluded
with
an
air
of
triumph
that
quite
squelched
the
district
attorney
kennedy
was
all
attention
have
you
preserved
samples
of
the
blood
of
templeton
and
miss
wainwright
he
asked
certainly
i
have
them
in
my
the
coroner
who
was
also
a
local
physician
led
us
back
into
his
private
office
and
the
cat
added
craig
doctor
nott
produced
it
in
a
covered
basket
quickly
kennedy
drew
off
a
little
of
the
blood
of
the
cat
and
held
it
up
to
the
light
along
with
the
human
samples
the
difference
was
apparent
you
see
he
explained
carbon
monoxide
combines
firmly
with
the
blood
destroying
the
red
colouring
matter
of
the
red
corpuscles
no
doctor
i
afraid
it
was
carbonic
oxide
that
killed
the
lovers
although
it
certainly
killed
the
doctor
nott
was
crestfallen
but
still
unconvinced
if
my
whole
medical
reputation
were
at
stake
he
repeated
i
should
still
be
compelled
to
swear
to
asphyxia
i
seen
it
too
often
to
make
a
mistake
carbonic
oxide
or
not
templeton
and
miss
wainwright
were
it
was
now
whitney
chance
to
air
his
theory
i
have
always
inclined
toward
the
theory
either
that
it
was
administered
in
a
drink
or
perhaps
injected
by
a
needle
he
said
one
of
the
chemists
has
reported
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
slight
traces
of
cyanide
in
the
if
it
had
been
cyanide
replied
craig
looking
reflectively
at
the
two
jars
before
him
on
the
table
these
blood
specimens
would
be
blue
in
colour
and
clotted
but
they
are
not
then
too
there
is
a
substance
in
the
saliva
which
is
used
in
the
process
of
digestion
it
gives
a
reaction
which
might
very
easily
be
mistaken
for
a
slight
trace
of
cyanide
i
think
that
explains
what
the
chemist
discovered
no
more
no
less
the
cyanide
theory
does
not
one
chemist
hinted
at
nux
vomica
volunteered
the
coroner
he
said
it
was
nux
vomica
but
that
the
blood
test
showed
something
very
much
like
it
oh
we
looked
for
morphine
chloroform
ether
all
the
ordinary
poisons
besides
some
of
the
little
known
alkaloids
believe
me
professor
kennedy
it
was
i
could
tell
by
the
look
that
crossed
kennedy
face
that
at
last
a
ray
of
light
had
pierced
the
darkness
have
you
any
spirits
of
turpentine
in
the
office
he
asked
the
coroner
shook
his
head
and
took
a
step
toward
the
telephone
as
if
to
call
the
in
town
or
ether
interrupted
craig
ether
will
oh
yes
plenty
of
craig
poured
a
little
of
one
of
the
blood
samples
from
the
jar
into
a
tube
and
added
a
few
drops
of
ether
a
cloudy
dark
precipitate
formed
he
smiled
quietly
and
said
half
to
himself
i
thought
what
is
it
asked
the
coroner
eagerly
nux
vomica
craig
shook
his
head
as
he
stared
at
the
black
precipitate
you
were
perfectly
right
about
the
asphyxiation
doctor
he
remarked
slowly
but
wrong
as
to
the
cause
it
was
carbon
monoxide
or
and
you
whitney
were
right
about
the
poison
too
only
it
is
a
poison
neither
of
you
ever
heard
what
is
it
we
asked
simultaneously
let
me
take
these
samples
and
make
some
further
tests
i
am
sure
of
it
but
it
is
new
to
me
wait
till
night
when
my
chain
of
evidence
is
completed
then
you
are
all
cordially
invited
to
attend
at
my
laboratory
at
the
university
i
ask
you
whitney
to
come
armed
with
a
warrant
for
john
or
jane
doe
please
see
that
the
wainwrights
particularly
marian
are
present
you
can
tell
inspector
that
vanderdyke
and
ralston
are
required
as
material
witnesses
anything
so
long
as
you
are
sure
that
these
five
persons
are
present
good
night
we
rode
back
to
the
city
in
silence
but
as
we
neared
the
station
kennedy
remarked
you
see
walter
these
people
are
like
the
newspapers
they
are
floundering
around
in
a
sea
of
unrelated
facts
there
is
more
than
they
think
back
of
this
crime
i
been
revolving
in
my
mind
how
it
will
be
possible
to
get
some
inkling
about
this
concession
of
vanderdyke
the
mining
claim
of
ralston
and
the
exact
itinerary
of
the
wainwright
trip
in
the
far
east
do
you
think
you
can
get
that
information
for
me
i
think
it
will
take
me
all
day
to
isolate
this
poison
and
get
things
in
convincing
shape
on
that
score
meanwhile
if
you
can
see
vanderdyke
and
ralston
you
can
help
me
a
great
deal
i
am
sure
you
will
find
them
very
interesting
i
have
been
told
that
she
is
quite
a
female
high
financier
i
replied
tacitly
accepting
craig
commission
her
story
is
that
her
claim
is
situated
near
the
mine
of
a
group
of
powerful
american
capitalists
who
are
opposed
to
having
any
competition
and
on
the
strength
of
that
story
she
has
been
raking
in
the
money
right
and
left
i
do
know
vanderdyke
never
heard
of
him
before
but
no
doubt
he
has
some
equally
interesting
do
let
them
think
you
connect
them
with
the
case
however
cautioned
craig
early
the
next
morning
i
started
out
on
my
quest
for
facts
though
not
so
early
but
that
kennedy
had
preceded
me
to
his
work
in
his
laboratory
it
was
not
very
difficult
to
get
ralston
to
talk
about
her
troubles
with
the
government
in
fact
i
did
not
even
have
to
broach
the
subject
of
the
death
of
templeton
she
volunteered
the
information
that
in
his
handling
of
her
case
he
had
been
very
unjust
to
her
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
had
known
him
well
a
long
time
ago
she
even
hinted
that
she
believed
he
represented
the
combination
of
capitalists
who
were
using
the
government
to
aid
their
own
monopoly
and
prevent
the
development
of
her
mine
whether
it
was
an
obsession
of
her
mind
or
merely
part
of
her
clever
scheme
i
could
not
make
out
i
noted
however
that
when
she
spoke
of
templeton
it
was
in
a
studied
impersonal
way
and
that
she
was
at
pains
to
lay
the
blame
for
the
governmental
interference
rather
on
the
rival
it
quite
surprised
me
when
i
found
from
the
directory
that
office
was
on
the
floor
below
in
the
same
building
like
ralston
it
was
open
but
not
doing
business
pending
the
investigation
by
the
department
vanderdyke
was
a
type
of
which
i
had
seen
many
before
well
dressed
to
the
extreme
he
displayed
all
those
evidences
of
prosperity
which
are
the
stock
in
trade
of
the
man
with
securities
to
sell
he
grasped
my
hand
when
i
told
him
i
was
going
to
present
the
other
side
of
the
cases
and
held
it
between
both
of
his
as
if
he
had
known
me
all
his
life
only
the
fact
that
he
had
never
seen
me
before
prevented
his
calling
me
by
my
first
name
i
took
mental
note
of
his
stock
of
jewellery
the
pin
in
his
tie
that
might
almost
have
been
the
hope
diamond
the
heavy
watch
chain
across
his
chest
and
a
very
brilliant
seal
ring
of
lapis
lazuli
on
the
hand
that
grasped
mine
he
saw
me
looking
at
it
and
smiled
my
dear
fellow
we
have
deposits
of
that
stuff
that
would
make
a
fortune
if
we
could
get
the
machinery
to
get
at
it
why
sir
there
is
lapis
lazuli
enough
on
our
claim
to
make
enough
ultramarine
paint
to
supply
all
the
artists
to
the
end
of
the
world
actually
we
could
afford
to
crush
it
up
and
sell
it
as
paint
and
that
is
merely
incidental
to
the
other
things
on
the
concession
the
asphalt
the
thing
where
the
big
money
is
when
we
get
started
sir
the
old
asphalt
trust
will
simply
melt
away
melt
he
blew
a
cloud
of
tobacco
smoke
and
let
it
dissolve
significantly
in
the
air
when
it
came
to
talking
about
the
suits
however
vanderdyke
was
not
so
communicative
as
ralston
but
he
was
also
not
so
bitter
against
either
the
or
templeton
poor
templeton
he
said
i
used
to
know
him
years
ago
when
we
were
boys
went
to
school
with
him
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
you
know
but
until
i
ran
across
him
or
rather
he
ran
across
me
in
this
investigation
i
had
heard
much
about
him
pretty
clever
fellow
he
was
too
the
state
will
miss
him
but
my
lawyer
tells
me
that
we
should
have
won
the
suit
anyhow
even
if
that
unfortunate
tragedy
occurred
most
unaccountable
was
it
i
read
about
it
in
the
papers
for
old
time
sake
and
can
make
nothing
out
of
i
said
nothing
but
wondered
how
he
could
pass
so
lightheartedly
over
the
death
of
the
woman
who
had
once
been
his
wife
however
i
said
nothing
the
result
was
he
launched
forth
again
on
the
riches
of
his
venezuelan
concession
and
loaded
me
down
with
literature
which
i
crammed
into
my
pocket
for
future
reference
my
next
step
was
to
drop
into
the
office
of
a
paper
whose
editor
was
especially
well
informed
on
south
american
affairs
do
i
know
ralston
he
repeated
thoughtfully
lighting
one
of
those
black
cigarettes
that
look
so
vicious
and
are
so
mild
i
should
say
so
i
tell
you
a
little
story
about
her
three
or
four
years
ago
she
turned
up
in
caracas
i
do
know
who
ralston
was
perhaps
there
never
was
any
ralston
anyhow
she
got
in
with
the
official
circle
of
the
castro
government
and
was
very
successful
as
an
adventuress
she
has
considerable
business
ability
and
represented
a
certain
group
of
americans
but
if
you
recall
when
castro
was
eliminated
pretty
nearly
everyone
who
had
stood
high
with
him
went
too
it
seems
that
a
number
of
the
old
concessionaires
played
the
game
on
both
sides
this
particular
group
had
a
man
named
vanderdyke
on
the
side
so
when
ralston
went
she
just
quietly
sailed
by
way
of
panama
to
the
other
side
of
the
continent
to
peru
they
paid
her
well
and
vanderdyke
took
the
title
role
oh
yes
she
and
vanderdyke
were
very
good
friends
very
indeed
i
think
they
must
have
known
each
other
here
in
the
states
still
they
played
their
parts
well
at
the
time
since
things
have
settled
down
in
venezuela
the
concessionaires
have
found
no
further
use
for
vanderdyke
either
and
here
they
are
vanderdyke
and
ralston
both
in
new
york
now
with
two
of
the
most
outrageous
schemes
of
financing
ever
seen
on
broad
street
they
have
offices
in
the
same
building
they
are
together
a
great
deal
and
now
i
hear
that
the
state
is
after
both
of
with
this
information
and
a
very
meagre
report
of
the
wainwright
trip
to
the
far
east
which
had
taken
in
some
places
apparently
i
hastened
back
to
kennedy
he
was
surrounded
by
bottles
tubes
jars
retorts
bunsen
burners
everything
in
the
science
and
art
of
chemistry
i
thought
i
did
like
the
way
he
looked
his
hand
was
unsteady
and
his
eyes
looked
badly
but
he
seemed
quite
put
out
when
i
suggested
that
he
was
working
too
hard
over
the
case
i
was
worried
about
him
but
rather
than
say
anything
to
offend
him
i
left
him
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
only
dropping
in
before
dinner
to
make
sure
that
he
would
not
forget
to
eat
something
he
was
then
completing
his
preparations
for
the
evening
they
were
of
the
simplest
kind
apparently
in
fact
all
i
could
see
was
an
apparatus
which
consisted
of
a
rubber
funnel
inverted
and
attached
to
a
rubber
tube
which
led
in
turn
into
a
jar
about
a
quarter
full
of
water
through
the
stopper
of
the
jar
another
tube
led
to
a
tank
of
oxygen
there
were
several
jars
of
various
liquids
on
the
table
and
a
number
of
chemicals
among
other
things
was
a
sort
of
gourd
encrusted
with
a
black
substance
and
in
a
corner
was
a
box
from
which
sounds
issued
as
if
it
contained
something
alive
i
did
not
trouble
kennedy
with
questions
for
i
was
only
too
glad
when
he
consented
to
take
a
brisk
walk
and
join
me
in
a
thick
porterhouse
it
was
a
large
party
that
gathered
in
kennedy
laboratory
that
night
one
of
the
largest
he
had
ever
had
and
wainwright
and
miss
marian
came
the
ladies
heavily
veiled
doctor
nott
and
whitney
were
among
the
first
to
arrive
later
came
vanderdyke
and
last
of
all
ralston
with
inspector
altogether
it
was
an
unwilling
party
i
shall
begin
said
kennedy
by
going
over
briefly
the
facts
in
this
tersely
he
summarised
it
to
my
surprise
laying
great
stress
on
the
proof
that
the
couple
had
been
asphyxiated
but
it
was
no
ordinary
asphyxiation
he
continued
we
have
to
deal
in
this
case
with
a
poison
which
is
apparently
among
the
most
subtle
known
a
particle
of
matter
so
minute
as
to
be
hardly
distinguishable
by
the
naked
eye
on
the
point
of
a
needle
or
a
lancet
a
prick
of
the
skin
scarcely
felt
under
any
circumstances
and
which
would
pass
quite
unheeded
if
the
attention
were
otherwise
engaged
and
not
all
the
power
in
the
world
unless
one
was
fully
prepared
could
save
the
life
of
the
person
in
whose
skin
the
puncture
had
been
craig
paused
a
moment
but
no
one
showed
any
evidence
of
being
more
than
ordinarily
impressed
this
poison
i
find
acts
on
the
endplates
of
the
muscles
and
nerves
it
produces
complete
paralysis
but
not
loss
of
consciousness
sensation
circulation
or
respiration
until
the
end
approaches
it
seems
to
be
one
of
the
most
powerful
sedatives
i
have
ever
heard
of
when
introduced
in
even
a
minute
quantity
it
produces
death
finally
by
asphyxiation
by
paralysing
the
muscles
of
respiration
this
asphyxia
is
what
so
puzzled
the
coroner
i
will
now
inject
a
little
of
the
blood
serum
of
the
victims
into
a
white
he
took
a
mouse
from
the
box
i
had
seen
and
with
a
needle
injected
the
serum
the
mouse
did
not
even
wince
so
lightly
did
he
touch
it
but
as
we
watched
its
life
seemed
gently
to
ebb
away
without
pain
and
without
struggle
its
breath
simply
seemed
to
stop
next
he
took
the
gourd
i
had
seen
on
the
table
and
with
a
knife
scraped
off
just
the
minutest
particle
of
the
black
stuff
that
encrusted
it
he
dissolved
the
particle
in
some
alcohol
and
with
a
sterilised
needle
repeated
his
experiment
on
a
second
mouse
the
effect
was
precisely
similar
to
that
produced
by
the
blood
on
the
first
it
did
not
seem
to
me
that
anyone
showed
any
emotion
except
possibly
the
slight
exclamation
that
escaped
miss
marian
wainwright
i
fell
to
wondering
whether
it
was
prompted
by
a
soft
heart
or
a
guilty
conscience
we
were
all
intent
on
what
craig
was
doing
especially
doctor
nott
who
now
broke
in
with
a
question
professor
kennedy
may
i
ask
a
question
admitting
that
the
first
mouse
died
in
an
apparently
similar
manner
to
the
second
what
proof
have
you
that
the
poison
is
the
same
in
both
cases
and
if
it
is
the
same
can
you
show
that
it
affects
human
beings
in
the
same
way
and
that
enough
of
it
has
been
discovered
in
the
blood
of
the
victims
to
have
caused
their
death
in
other
words
i
want
the
last
doubt
set
aside
how
do
you
know
absolutely
that
this
poison
which
you
discovered
in
my
office
last
night
in
that
black
precipitate
when
you
added
the
ether
how
do
you
know
that
it
asphyxiated
the
victims
if
ever
craig
startled
me
it
was
by
his
quiet
reply
i
isolated
it
in
their
blood
extracted
it
sterilised
it
and
i
tried
it
on
in
breathless
amazement
with
eyes
riveted
on
craig
we
listened
altogether
i
was
able
to
recover
from
the
blood
samples
of
both
of
the
victims
of
this
crime
six
centigrams
of
the
poison
he
pursued
starting
with
two
centigrams
of
it
as
a
moderate
dose
i
injected
it
into
my
right
arm
subcutaneously
then
i
slowly
worked
my
way
up
to
three
and
then
four
centigrams
they
did
not
produce
any
very
appreciable
results
other
than
to
cause
some
dizziness
slight
vertigo
a
considerable
degree
of
lassitude
and
an
extremely
painful
headache
of
rather
unusual
duration
but
five
centigrams
considerably
improved
on
this
it
caused
a
degree
of
vertigo
and
lassitude
that
was
most
distressing
and
six
centigrams
the
whole
amount
which
i
had
recovered
from
the
samples
of
blood
gave
me
the
fright
of
my
life
right
here
in
this
laboratory
this
afternoon
perhaps
i
was
not
wise
in
giving
myself
so
large
an
injection
on
a
day
when
i
was
overheated
and
below
par
otherwise
because
of
the
strain
i
have
been
under
in
handling
this
case
however
that
may
be
the
added
centigram
produced
so
much
more
on
top
of
the
five
centigrams
previously
taken
that
for
a
time
i
had
reason
to
fear
that
that
additional
centigram
was
just
the
amount
needed
to
bring
my
experiments
to
a
permanent
close
within
three
minutes
of
the
time
of
injection
the
dizziness
and
vertigo
had
become
so
great
as
to
make
walking
seem
impossible
in
another
minute
the
lassitude
rapidly
crept
over
me
and
the
serious
disturbance
of
my
breathing
made
it
apparent
to
me
that
walking
waving
my
arms
anything
was
imperative
my
lungs
felt
glued
up
and
the
muscles
of
my
chest
refused
to
work
everything
swam
before
my
eyes
and
i
was
soon
reduced
to
walking
up
and
down
the
laboratory
with
halting
steps
only
preventing
falling
on
the
floor
by
holding
fast
to
the
edge
of
this
table
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
spent
hours
gasping
for
breath
it
reminded
me
of
what
i
once
experienced
in
the
cave
of
the
winds
of
niagara
where
water
is
more
abundant
in
the
atmosphere
than
air
my
watch
afterward
indicated
only
about
twenty
minutes
of
extreme
distress
but
that
twenty
minutes
is
one
never
to
be
forgotten
and
i
advise
you
all
if
you
ever
are
so
foolish
as
to
try
the
experiment
to
remain
below
the
limit
how
much
was
administered
to
the
victims
doctor
nott
i
can
not
say
but
it
must
have
been
a
good
deal
more
than
i
took
six
centigrams
which
i
recovered
from
these
small
samples
are
only
of
a
grain
yet
you
see
what
effect
it
had
i
trust
that
answers
your
doctor
nott
was
too
overwhelmed
to
reply
and
what
is
this
deadly
poison
continued
craig
anticipating
our
thoughts
i
have
been
fortunate
enough
to
obtain
a
sample
of
it
from
the
museum
of

history
it
comes
in
a
little
gourd
or
often
a
calabash
this
is
in
a
gourd
it
is
blackish
brittle
stuff
encrusting
the
sides
of
the
gourd
just
as
if
it
was
poured
in
in
the
liquid
state
and
left
to
dry
indeed
that
is
just
what
has
been
done
by
those
who
manufacture
this
stuff
after
a
lengthy
and
somewhat
secret
he
placed
the
gourd
on
the
edge
of
the
table
where
we
could
all
see
it
i
was
almost
afraid
even
to
look
at
it
the
famous
traveller
sir
robert
schomburgh
first
brought
it
into
europe
and
darwin
has
described
it
it
is
now
an
article
of
commerce
and
is
to
be
found
in
the
united
states
pharmacopoeia
as
a
medicine
though
of
course
it
is
used
in
only
very
minute
quantities
as
a
heart
craig
opened
a
book
to
a
place
he
had
marked
at
least
one
person
in
this
room
will
appreciate
the
local
colour
of
a
little
incident
i
am
going
to
read
to
illustrate
what
death
from
this
poison
is
like
two
natives
of
the
part
of
the
world
whence
it
comes
were
one
day
hunting
they
were
armed
with
blowpipes
and
quivers
full
of
poisoned
darts
made
of
thin
charred
pieces
of
bamboo
tipped
with
this
stuff
one
of
them
aimed
a
dart
it
missed
the
object
overhead
glanced
off
the
tree
and
fell
down
on
the
hunter
himself
this
is
how
the
other
native
reported
the
result
takes
the
dart
out
of
his
shoulder
never
a
word
puts
it
in
his
quiver
and
throws
it
in
the
stream
gives
me
his
blowpipe
for
his
little
son
says
to
me
for
his
wife
and
the
village
then
he
lies
down
his
tongue
talks
no
longer
no
sight
in
his
eyes
he
folds
his
arms
he
rolls
over
slowly
his
mouth
moves
without
sound
i
feel
his
heart
it
goes
fast
and
then
slow
it
stops
quacca
has
shot
his
last
woorali
dart
we
looked
at
each
other
and
the
horror
of
the
thing
sank
deep
into
our
minds
woorali
what
was
it
there
were
many
travellers
in
the
room
who
had
been
in
the
orient
home
of
poisons
and
in
south
america
which
one
had
run
across
the
poison
woorali
or
curare
said
craig
slowly
is
the
poison
with
which
the
south
american
indians
of
the
upper
orinoco
tip
their
arrows
its
principal
ingredient
is
derived
from
the
strychnos
toxifera
tree
which
yields
also
the
drug
nux
a
great
light
dawned
on
me
i
turned
quickly
to
where
vanderdyke
was
sitting
next
to
ralston
and
a
little
behind
her
his
stony
stare
and
laboured
breathing
told
me
that
he
had
read
the
purport
of
actions
for
god
sake
craig
i
gasped
an
emetic
quick
a
trace
of
a
smile
flitted
over
vanderdyke
features
as
much
as
to
say
that
he
was
beyond
our
interference
vanderdyke
said
craig
with
what
seemed
to
me
a
brutal
calmness
then
it
was
you
who
were
the
visitor
who
last
saw
laura
wainwright
and
john
templeton
alive
whether
you
shot
a
dart
at
them
i
do
not
know
but
you
are
the
vanderdyke
raised
his
hand
as
if
to
assent
it
fell
back
limp
and
i
noted
the
ring
of
the
bluest
lapis
lazuli
ralston
threw
herself
toward
him
will
you
not
do
something
is
there
no
antidote
do
let
him
die
she
cried
you
are
the
murderer
repeated
kennedy
as
if
demanding
a
final
answer
again
the
hand
moved
in
confession
and
he
feebly
moved
the
finger
on
which
shone
the
ring
our
attention
was
centred
on
vanderdyke
ralston
unobserved
went
to
the
table
and
picked
up
the
gourd
before
could
stop
her
she
had
rubbed
her
tongue
on
the
black
substance
inside
it
was
only
a
little
bit
for
quickly
dashed
it
from
her
lips
and
threw
the
gourd
through
the
window
smashing
the
glass
kennedy
he
shouted
frantically
mrs
ralston
has
swallowed
some
of
kennedy
seemed
so
intent
on
vanderdyke
that
i
had
to
repeat
the
remark
without
looking
up
he
said
oh
one
can
swallow
it
it
strange
but
it
is
comparatively
inert
if
swallowed
even
in
a
pretty
quantity
i
doubt
if
ralston
ever
heard
of
it
before
except
by
hearsay
if
she
had
she
have
scratched
herself
with
it
instead
of
swallowing
if
craig
had
been
indifferent
to
the
emergency
of
vanderdyke
before
he
was
all
action
now
that
the
confession
had
been
made
in
an
instant
vanderdyke
was
stretched
on
the
floor
and
craig
had
taken
out
the
apparatus
i
had
seen
during
the
afternoon
i
am
prepared
for
this
he
exclaimed
quickly
here
is
the
apparatus
for
artificial
respiration
nott
hold
that
rubber
funnel
over
his
nose
and
start
the
oxygen
from
the
tank
pull
his
tongue
forward
so
it
fall
down
his
throat
and
choke
him
i
work
his
arms
walter
make
a
tourniquet
of
your
handkerchief
and
put
it
tightly
on
the
muscles
of
his
left
arm
that
may
keep
some
of
the
poison
in
his
arm
from
spreading
into
the
rest
of
his
body
this
is
the
only
antidote
known
artificial
kennedy
was
working
feverishly
going
through
the
motions
of
first
aid
to
a
drowned
man
ralston
was
on
her
knees
beside
vanderdyke
kissing
his
hands
and
forehead
whenever
kennedy
stopped
for
a
minute
and
crying
softly
schuyler
poor
boy
i
wonder
how
you
could
have
done
it
i
was
with
him
that
day
we
rode
up
in
his
car
and
as
we
passed
through
williston
he
said
he
would
stop
a
minute
and
wish
templeton
luck
i
did
think
it
strange
for
he
said
he
had
nothing
any
longer
against
laura
wainwright
and
templeton
only
did
his
duty
as
a
lawyer
against
us
i
forgave
john
for
prosecuting
us
but
schuyler
did
after
all
oh
my
poor
boy
why
did
you
do
it
we
could
have
gone
somewhere
else
and
started
all
over
again
it
would
have
been
the
first
at
last
came
the
flutter
of
an
eyelid
and
a
voluntary
breath
or
two
vanderdyke
seemed
to
realise
where
he
was
with
a
last
supreme
effort
he
raised
his
hand
and
drew
it
slowly
across
his
face
then
he
fell
back
exhausted
by
the
effort
but
he
had
at
last
put
himself
beyond
the
reach
of
the
law
there
was
no
tourniquet
that
would
confine
the
poison
now
in
the
scratch
across
his
face
back
of
those
eyes
he
heard
and
knew
but
could
not
move
or
speak
his
voice
was
gone
his
limbs
his
face
his
chest
and
last
his
eyes
i
wondered
if
it
were
possible
to
conceive
a
more
dreadful
torture
than
that
endured
by
a
mind
which
so
witnessed
the
dying
of
one
organ
after
another
of
its
own
body
shut
up
as
it
were
in
the
fulness
of
life
within
a
corpse
i
looked
in
bewilderment
at
the
scratch
on
his
face
how
did
he
do
it
i
asked
carefully
craig
drew
off
the
azure
ring
and
examined
it
in
that
part
which
surrounded
the
blue
lapis
lazuli
he
indicated
a
hollow
point
concealed
it
worked
with
a
spring
and
communicated
with
a
little
receptacle
behind
in
such
a
way
that
the
murderer
could
give
the
fatal
scratch
while
shaking
hands
with
his
victim
i
shuddered
for
my
hand
had
once
been
clasped
by
the
one
wearing
that
poison
ring
which
had
sent
templeton
and
his
fiancee
and
now
vanderdyke
himself
to
their
deaths
viii
spontaneous
combustion
kennedy
and
i
had
risen
early
for
we
were
hustling
to
get
off
for
a
at
atlantic
city
kennedy
was
tugging
at
the
straps
of
his
grip
and
remonstrating
with
it
under
his
breath
when
the
door
opened
and
a
stuck
his
head
in
does
kennedy
live
here
he
asked
craig
impatiently
seized
the
pencil
signed
his
name
in
the
book
and
tore
open
a
night
letter
from
the
prolonged
silence
that
followed
i
felt
a
sense
of
misgiving
i
at
least
had
set
my
heart
on
the
atlantic
city
outing
but
with
the
appearance
of
the
i
intuitively
felt
that
the
board
walk
would
not
see
us
that
week
i
afraid
the
atlantic
city
trip
is
off
walter
remarked
craig
seriously
you
remember
tom
langley
in
our
class
at
the
university
well
read
i
laid
down
my
safety
razor
and
took
the
message
tom
had
not
spared
words
and
i
could
see
at
a
glance
at
the
mere
length
of
the
thing
that
it
must
be
important
it
was
from
camp
in
the
adirondacks
dear
old
it
began
regardless
of
expense
can
you
arrange
to
come
up
here
by
next
train
after
you
receive
this
uncle
lewis
is
dead
most
mysterious
last
night
after
we
retired
noticed
peculiar
odour
about
house
did
pay
much
attention
this
morning
found
him
lying
on
floor
of
head
and
chest
literally
burned
to
ashes
but
lower
part
of
body
and
arms
untouched
room
shows
no
evidence
of
fire
but
full
of
sort
of
oily
soot
otherwise
nothing
unusual
on
table
near
body
siphon
of
seltzer
bottle
of
imported
limes
and
glass
for
rickeys
have
removed
body
but
am
keeping
room
exactly
as
found
until
you
arrive
bring
jameson
wire
if
you
can
not
come
but
make
every
effort
and
spare
no
expense
anxiously
tom
craig
was
impatiently
looking
at
his
watch
as
i
hastily
ran
through
the
letter
hurry
walter
he
exclaimed
we
can
just
catch
the
empire
state
never
mind
shaving
we
have
a
stopover
at
utica
to
wait
for
the
montreal
express
here
put
the
rest
of
your
things
in
your
grip
and
jam
it
shut
we
get
something
to
eat
on
the
train
i
hope
i
wire
we
coming
do
forget
to
latch
the
kennedy
was
already
to
the
elevator
and
i
followed
ruefully
still
thinking
of
the
ocean
and
the
piers
the
bands
and
the
roller
chairs
it
was
a
good
journey
up
to
the
little
station
nearest
camp
and
at
least
a
two
hour
ride
after
that
we
had
plenty
of
time
to
reflect
over
what
this
death
might
mean
to
tom
and
his
sister
and
to
speculate
on
the
manner
of
it
tom
and
grace
langley
were
relatives
by
marriage
of
lewis
langley
who
after
the
death
of
his
wife
had
made
them
his
proteges
lewis
langley
was
principally
noted
as
far
as
i
could
recall
for
being
a
member
of
some
of
the
fastest
clubs
of
both
new
york
and
london
neither
kennedy
nor
myself
had
shared
in
the
world
opinion
of
him
for
we
knew
how
good
he
had
been
to
tom
in
college
and
from
tom
how
good
he
had
been
to
grace
in
fact
he
had
made
tom
assume
the
langley
name
and
in
every
way
had
treated
the
brother
and
sister
as
if
they
had
been
his
own
children
tom
met
us
with
a
smart
trap
at
the
station
a
sufficient
indication
if
we
had
not
already
known
of
the
roughing
it
at
such
a
luxurious
adirondack
camp
as
camp
he
was
unaffectedly
glad
to
see
us
and
it
was
not
difficult
to
read
in
his
face
the
worry
which
the
affair
had
already
given
him
tom
i
awfully
sorry
to
began
craig
when
warned
by
look
at
the
curious
crowd
that
always
gathers
at
the
railroad
station
at
train
time
he
cut
it
short
we
stood
silently
a
moment
while
tom
was
arranging
the
trap
for
us
as
we
swung
around
the
bend
in
the
road
that
cut
off
the
little
station
and
its
crowd
of
kennedy
was
the
first
to
speak
tom
he
said
first
of
all
let
me
ask
that
when
we
get
to
the
camp
we
are
to
be
simply
two
old
classmates
whom
you
had
asked
to
spend
a
few
days
before
the
tragedy
occurred
anything
will
do
there
may
be
nothing
at
all
to
your
evident
suspicions
and
then
again
there
may
at
any
rate
play
the
game
safely
do
arouse
any
feeling
which
might
cause
unpleasantness
later
in
case
you
are
i
quite
agree
with
you
answered
tom
you
wired
from
albany
i
think
to
keep
the
facts
out
of
the
papers
as
much
as
possible
afraid
it
is
too
late
for
that
of
course
the
thing
became
vaguely
known
in
saranac
although
the
county
officers
have
been
very
considerate
of
us
and
this
morning
a
new
york
record
correspondent
was
over
and
talked
with
us
i
could
refuse
that
would
have
put
a
very
bad
face
on
too
bad
i
exclaimed
i
had
hoped
at
least
to
be
able
to
keep
the
report
down
to
a
few
lines
in
the
star
but
the
record
will
have
such
a
yellow
story
about
it
that
i
simply
have
to
do
something
to
counteract
the
yes
assented
craig
but
wait
let
see
the
record
story
first
the
office
does
know
you
up
here
you
can
hold
up
the
star
and
give
us
time
to
look
things
over
perhaps
get
in
a
beat
on
the
real
story
and
set
things
right
anyhow
the
news
is
out
that
certain
we
must
work
quickly
tell
me
tom
who
are
at
the
camp
anyone
except
relatives
no
he
replied
guardedly
measuring
his
words
uncle
lewis
had
invited
his
brother
james
and
his
niece
and
nephew
isabelle
and
james
junior
we
call
him
junior
then
there
are
grace
and
myself
and
a
distant
relative
harrington
brown
and
oh
of
course
physician
doctor
who
is
harrington
brown
asked
craig
he
on
the
other
side
of
the
langley
family
on
uncle
lewis
side
i
think
or
at
least
grace
thinks
that
he
is
quite
in
love
with
isabelle
harrington
brown
would
be
quite
a
catch
of
course
he
wealthy
but
his
family
is
mighty
well
connected
oh
craig
sighed
langley
i
wish
he
had
done
it
uncle
lewis
i
mean
why
did
he
invite
his
brother
up
here
now
when
he
needed
to
recover
from
the
swift
pace
of
last
winter
in
new
york
you
know
or
you
do
know
i
suppose
but
you
know
it
now
when
he
and
uncle
jim
got
together
there
was
nothing
to
it
but
one
drink
after
another
doctor
putnam
was
quite
disgusted
at
least
he
professed
to
be
but
craig
he
lowered
his
voice
to
a
whisper
as
if
the
very
forest
had
ears
they
all
alike
they
been
just
waiting
for
uncle
lewis
to
drink
himself
to
death
oh
he
added
bitterly
there
no
love
lost
between
me
and
the
relatives
on
that
score
i
can
assure
how
did
you
find
him
that
morning
asked
kennedy
as
if
to
turn
off
this
unlocking
of
family
secrets
to
strangers
that
the
worst
part
of
the
whole
affair
replied
tom
and
even
in
the
dusk
i
could
see
the
lines
of
his
face
tighten
you
know
uncle
lewis
was
a
hard
drinker
but
he
never
seemed
to
show
it
much
we
had
been
out
on
the
lake
in
the
fishing
all
the
afternoon
and
well
i
must
admit
both
my
uncles
had
had
frequent
recourse
to
pistols
and
i
remember
they
referred
to
it
each
time
as
then
after
supper
nothing
would
do
but
fizzes
and
rickeys
i
was
disgusted
and
after
reading
a
bit
went
to
bed
harrington
and
my
uncles
sat
up
with
doctor
putnam
according
to
uncle
jim
for
a
couple
of
hours
longer
then
harrington
doctor
putnam
and
uncle
jim
went
to
bed
leaving
uncle
lewis
still
drinking
i
remember
waking
in
the
night
and
the
house
seemed
saturated
with
a
peculiar
odour
i
never
smelt
anything
like
it
in
my
life
so
i
got
up
and
slipped
into
my
bathrobe
i
met
grace
in
the
hall
she
was
sniffing
you
smell
something
burning
she
asked
i
said
i
did
and
started
to
investigate
everything
was
dark
but
that
smell
was
all
over
the
house
i
looked
in
each
room
as
i
went
but
could
see
nothing
the
kitchen
and
were
all
right
i
glanced
into
the
but
while
the
smell
was
more
noticeable
there
i
could
see
no
evidence
of
a
fire
except
the
dying
embers
on
the
hearth
it
had
been
coolish
that
night
and
we
had
had
a
few
logs
blazing
i
did
examine
the
room
there
seemed
no
reason
for
it
we
went
back
to
our
rooms
and
in
the
morning
they
found
the
gruesome
object
i
had
missed
in
the
darkness
and
shadows
of
the
kennedy
was
intently
listening
who
found
him
he
asked
harrington
replied
tom
he
roused
us
harrington
theory
is
that
uncle
set
himself
on
fire
with
a
spark
from
his
cigar
a
charred
cigar
butt
was
found
on
the
we
found
tom
relatives
a
saddened
silent
party
in
the
face
of
the
tragedy
kennedy
and
i
apologised
very
profusely
for
our
intrusion
but
tom
quickly
interrupted
as
we
had
agreed
by
explaining
that
he
had
insisted
on
our
coming
as
old
friends
on
whom
he
felt
he
could
rely
especially
to
set
the
matter
right
in
the
newspapers
i
think
craig
noticed
keenly
the
reticence
of
the
family
group
in
the
mystery
i
might
almost
have
called
it
suspicion
they
did
not
seem
to
know
just
whether
to
take
it
as
an
accident
or
as
something
worse
and
each
seemed
to
entertain
a
reserve
toward
the
rest
which
was
very
uncomfortable
langley
attorney
in
new
york
had
been
notified
but
apparently
was
out
of
town
for
he
had
not
been
heard
from
they
seemed
rather
anxious
to
get
word
from
him
dinner
over
the
family
group
separated
leaving
tom
an
opportunity
to
take
us
into
the
gruesome
of
course
the
remains
had
been
removed
but
otherwise
the
room
was
exactly
as
it
had
been
when
harrington
discovered
the
tragedy
i
did
not
see
the
body
which
was
lying
in
an
anteroom
but
kennedy
did
and
spent
some
time
in
there
after
he
rejoined
us
kennedy
next
examined
the
fireplace
it
was
full
of
ashes
from
the
logs
which
had
been
lighted
on
the
fatal
night
he
noted
attentively
the
distance
of
lewis
langley
chair
from
the
fireplace
and
remarked
that
the
varnish
on
the
chair
was
not
even
blistered
before
the
chair
on
the
floor
where
the
body
had
been
found
he
pointed
out
to
us
the
peculiar
for
some
space
around
but
it
really
seemed
to
me
as
if
something
else
interested
him
more
than
these
we
had
been
engaged
perhaps
half
an
hour
in
viewing
the
room
at
last
craig
suddenly
stopped
tom
he
said
i
think
i
wait
till
daylight
before
i
go
any
further
i
ca
tell
with
certainty
under
these
lights
though
perhaps
they
show
me
some
things
the
sunlight
would
show
we
better
leave
everything
just
as
it
is
until
so
we
locked
the
room
again
and
went
into
a
sort
of
library
across
the
hall
we
were
sitting
in
silence
each
occupied
with
his
own
thoughts
on
the
mystery
when
the
telephone
rang
it
proved
to
be
a
call
from
new
york
for
tom
himself
his
uncle
attorney
had
received
the
news
at
his
home
out
on
long
island
and
had
hurried
to
the
city
to
take
charge
of
the
estate
but
that
was
not
the
news
that
caused
the
grave
look
on
tom
face
as
he
nervously
rejoined
us
that
was
uncle
lawyer
clark
of
clark
burdick
he
said
he
has
opened
uncle
personal
safe
in
the
offices
of
the
langley
estate
you
remember
them
craig
where
all
the
property
of
the
langley
heirs
is
administered
by
the
trustees
he
says
he
ca
find
the
will
though
he
knows
there
was
a
will
and
that
it
was
placed
in
that
safe
some
time
ago
there
is
no
the
full
purport
of
this
information
at
once
flashed
on
me
and
i
was
on
the
point
of
blurting
out
my
sympathy
when
i
saw
by
the
look
which
craig
and
tom
exchanged
that
they
had
already
realised
it
and
understood
each
other
without
the
will
the
would
inherit
all
of
lewis
langley
interest
in
the
old
langley
estate
tom
and
his
sister
would
be
penniless
it
was
late
yet
we
sat
for
nearly
an
hour
longer
and
i
do
think
we
exchanged
a
sentences
in
all
that
time
craig
seemed
absorbed
in
thought
at
length
as
the
great
sounded
midnight
we
rose
as
if
by
common
consent
tom
said
craig
and
i
could
feel
the
sympathy
that
welled
up
in
his
voice
tom
old
man
i
get
at
the
bottom
of
this
mystery
if
human
intelligence
can
do
i
know
you
will
craig
responded
tom
grasping
each
of
us
by
the
hand
that
why
i
so
much
wanted
you
fellows
to
come
up
early
in
the
morning
kennedy
aroused
me
now
walter
i
going
to
ask
you
to
come
down
into
the
with
me
and
we
take
a
look
at
it
in
the
i
hurried
into
my
clothes
and
together
we
quietly
went
down
starting
with
the
exact
spot
where
the
unfortunate
man
had
been
discovered
kennedy
began
a
minute
examination
of
the
floor
using
his
pocket
lens
every
few
moments
he
would
stop
to
examine
a
spot
on
the
rug
or
on
the
hardwood
floor
more
intently
several
times
i
saw
him
scrape
up
something
with
the
blade
of
his
knife
and
carefully
preserve
the
scrapings
each
in
a
separate
piece
of
paper
sitting
idly
by
i
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
see
just
what
good
it
did
for
me
to
be
there
and
i
said
as
much
kennedy
laughed
quietly
you
a
material
witness
walter
he
replied
perhaps
i
shall
need
you
some
day
to
testify
that
i
actually
found
these
spots
in
this
just
then
tom
stuck
his
head
in
can
i
help
he
asked
why
did
you
tell
me
you
were
going
at
it
so
early
no
thanks
answered
craig
rising
from
the
floor
i
was
just
making
a
careful
examination
of
the
room
before
anyone
was
up
so
that
nobody
would
think
i
was
too
interested
i
finished
but
you
can
help
me
after
all
do
you
think
you
could
describe
exactly
how
everyone
was
dressed
that
night
why
i
can
try
let
me
see
to
begin
with
uncle
had
on
a
that
was
pretty
well
burnt
as
you
know
why
in
fact
we
all
had
our
on
the
ladies
were
in
craig
pondered
a
little
but
did
not
seem
disposed
to
pursue
the
subject
further
until
tom
volunteered
the
information
that
since
the
tragedy
none
of
them
had
been
wearing
their
shooting
jackets
we
all
been
wearing
city
clothes
he
remarked
could
you
get
your
uncle
james
and
your
cousin
junior
to
go
with
you
for
an
hour
or
two
this
morning
on
the
lake
or
on
a
tramp
in
the
woods
asked
craig
after
a
moment
thought
really
craig
responded
tom
doubtfully
i
ought
to
go
to
saranac
to
complete
the
arrangements
for
taking
uncle
lewis
body
to
new
very
well
persuade
them
to
go
with
you
anything
so
long
as
you
keep
me
from
interruption
for
an
hour
or
they
agreed
on
doing
that
and
as
by
that
time
most
of
the
family
were
up
we
went
in
to
breakfast
another
silent
and
suspicious
meal
after
breakfast
kennedy
tactfully
withdrew
from
the
family
and
i
did
the
same
we
wandered
off
in
the
direction
of
the
stables
and
there
fell
to
admiring
some
of
the
horses
the
groom
who
seemed
to
be
a
sensible
and
pleasant
sort
of
fellow
was
quite
ready
to
talk
and
soon
he
and
craig
were
deep
in
discussing
the
game
of
the
north
country
many
rabbits
about
here
asked
kennedy
at
length
when
they
had
exhausted
the
larger
game
oh
yes
i
saw
one
this
morning
sir
replied
the
groom
indeed
said
kennedy
do
you
suppose
you
could
catch
a
couple
for
me
guess
i
could
sir
alive
you
mean
oh
yes
alive
i
do
want
you
to
violate
the
game
laws
this
is
the
closed
season
is
it
yes
sir
but
then
it
all
right
sir
here
on
the
bring
them
to
me
this
afternoon
or
no
keep
them
here
in
the
stable
in
a
cage
and
let
me
know
when
you
have
them
if
anybody
asks
you
about
them
say
they
belong
to
craig
handed
a
small
treasury
note
to
the
groom
who
took
it
with
a
grin
and
touched
his
hat
thanks
he
said
i
let
you
know
when
i
have
the
as
we
walked
slowly
back
from
the
stables
we
caught
sight
of
tom
down
at
the
just
putting
off
in
the
with
his
uncle
and
cousin
craig
waved
to
him
and
he
walked
up
to
meet
us
while
you
in
saranac
said
craig
buy
me
a
dozen
or
so
only
do
let
anyone
here
at
the
house
know
you
are
buying
them
they
might
ask
while
they
were
gone
kennedy
stole
into
james
langley
room
and
after
a
few
minutes
returned
to
our
room
with
the
he
carefully
examined
it
with
his
pocket
lens
then
he
filled
a
with
warm
boiled
water
and
added
a
few
pinches
of
table
salt
with
a
piece
of
sterilised
gauze
from
doctor
putnam
he
carefully
washed
off
a
few
portions
of
the
coat
and
set
the
glass
and
the
gauze
soaking
in
it
aside
then
he
returned
the
coat
to
the
closet
where
he
had
found
it
next
as
silently
he
stole
into
junior
room
and
repeated
the
process
with
his
using
another
glass
and
piece
of
gauze
while
i
am
out
of
the
room
walter
he
said
i
want
you
to
take
these
two
glasses
cover
them
and
number
them
and
on
a
slip
of
paper
which
you
must
retain
place
the
names
of
the
owners
of
the
respective
coats
i
do
like
this
part
of
it
i
hate
to
play
spy
and
would
much
rather
come
out
in
the
open
but
there
is
nothing
else
to
do
and
it
is
much
better
for
all
concerned
that
i
should
play
the
game
secretly
just
now
there
may
be
no
cause
for
suspicion
at
all
in
that
case
i
never
forgive
myself
for
starting
a
family
row
and
then
again
but
we
shall
after
i
had
numbered
and
recorded
the
glasses
kennedy
returned
and
we
went
again
curious
about
the
will
is
it
i
remarked
as
we
stood
on
the
wide
verandah
a
moment
yes
he
replied
it
may
be
necessary
to
go
back
to
new
york
to
delve
into
that
part
of
it
before
we
get
through
but
i
hope
not
we
at
this
point
the
groom
interrupted
us
to
say
that
he
had
caught
the
rabbits
kennedy
at
once
hurried
to
the
stable
there
he
rolled
up
his
sleeves
pricked
a
vein
in
his
arm
and
injected
a
small
quantity
of
his
own
blood
into
one
of
the
rabbits
the
other
he
did
not
touch
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
tom
returned
from
town
with
his
uncle
and
cousin
he
seemed
even
more
agitated
than
usual
without
a
word
he
hurried
up
from
the
landing
and
sought
us
out
what
do
you
think
of
that
he
cried
opening
a
copy
of
the
record
and
laying
it
flat
on
the
library
table
there
on
the
front
page
was
lewis
langley
picture
with
a
huge
mysterious
case
of
spontaneous
combustion
it
all
out
groaned
tom
as
we
bent
over
to
read
the
account
and
such
a
story
under
the
date
of
the
day
previous
a
saranac
despatch
ran
lewis
langley
well
known
as
sporting
man
and
club
member
in
new
york
and
eldest
son
of
the
late
lewis
langley
the
banker
was
discovered
dead
under
the
most
mysterious
circumstances
this
morning
at
camp
hangout
twelve
miles
from
this
town
the
death
of
old
krook
in
dickens
bleak
house
or
of
the
victim
in
one
of
marryat
most
thrilling
tales
was
not
more
gruesome
than
this
actual
fact
it
is
without
doubt
a
case
of
spontaneous
human
combustion
such
as
is
recorded
beyond
dispute
in
medical
and
of
the
past
two
centuries
scientists
in
this
city
consulted
for
the
record
agree
that
while
rare
spontaneous
human
combustion
is
an
established
fact
and
that
everything
in
this
curious
case
goes
to
show
that
another
has
been
added
to
the
already
list
of
cases
recorded
in
america
and
europe
the
family
refuse
to
be
interviewed
which
seems
to
indicate
that
the
rumours
in
medical
circles
in
saranac
have
a
solid
basis
of
fact
then
followed
a
circumstantial
account
of
the
life
of
langley
and
the
events
leading
up
to
the
discovery
of
the
body
fairly
accurate
in
itself
but
highly
coloured
the
record
man
must
have
made
good
use
of
his
time
here
i
commented
as
i
finished
reading
the
despatch
and
well
they
must
have
done
some
hard
work
in
new
york
to
get
this
story
up
so
completely
see
after
the
despatch
follow
a
lot
of
interviews
and
here
is
a
short
article
on
spontaneous
combustion
harrington
and
the
rest
of
the
family
had
just
come
in
what
this
we
hear
about
the
record
having
an
article
harrington
asked
read
it
aloud
professor
so
we
can
all
hear
human
combustion
or
catacausis
ebriosus
began
craig
one
of
the
baffling
human
scientific
mysteries
indeed
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
that
individuals
have
in
some
strange
and
inexplicable
manner
caught
fire
and
been
partially
or
almost
wholly
consumed
have
attributed
it
to
gases
in
the
body
such
as
carbureted
hydrogen
once
it
was
noted
at
the
hotel
dieu
in
paris
that
a
body
on
being
dissected
gave
forth
a
gas
which
was
inflammable
and
burned
with
a
bluish
flame
others
have
attributed
the
combustion
to
alcohol
a
toper
several
years
ago
in
brooklyn
and
new
york
used
to
make
money
by
blowing
his
breath
through
a
wire
gauze
and
lighting
it
whatever
the
cause
medical
literature
records
cases
of
catacausis
in
two
hundred
years
combustion
seems
to
be
sudden
and
is
apparently
confined
to
the
cavities
the
abdomen
chest
and
head
victims
of
ordinary
fire
accidents
rush
hither
and
thither
frantically
succumb
from
exhaustion
their
limbs
are
burned
and
their
clothing
is
all
destroyed
but
in
catacausis
they
are
stricken
down
without
warning
the
limbs
are
rarely
burned
and
only
the
clothing
in
contact
with
the
head
and
chest
is
consumed
the
residue
is
like
a
distillation
of
animal
tissue
grey
and
dark
with
an
overpoweringly
fetid
odour
they
are
said
to
burn
with
a
flickering
stifled
blue
flame
and
water
far
from
arresting
the
combustion
seems
to
add
to
it
gin
is
particularly
rich
in
inflammable
empyreumatic
oils
as
they
are
called
and
in
most
cases
it
is
recorded
that
the
catacausis
took
place
among
old
and
obese
the
past
few
years
cases
are
on
record
which
seem
to
establish
catacausis
beyond
doubt
in
one
case
the
heat
was
so
great
as
to
explode
a
pistol
in
the
pocket
of
the
victim
in
another
a
woman
the
husband
was
asphyxiated
by
the
smoke
the
woman
weighed
one
hundred
and
eighty
pounds
in
life
but
the
ashes
weighed
only
twelve
pounds
in
all
these
cases
the
proof
of
spontaneous
combustion
seems
conclusive
as
craig
finished
reading
we
looked
blankly
horrified
at
one
another
it
was
too
dreadful
to
realise
what
do
you
think
of
it
professor
asked
james
langley
at
length
i
read
somewhere
of
such
cases
but
to
think
of
its
actually
happening
and
to
my
own
brother
do
you
really
think
lewis
could
have
met
his
death
in
this
terrible
manner
kennedy
made
no
reply
harrington
seemed
absorbed
in
thought
a
shudder
passed
over
us
as
we
thought
about
it
but
gruesome
as
it
was
it
was
evident
that
the
publication
of
the
story
in
the
record
had
relieved
the
feelings
of
the
family
group
in
one
respect
it
at
least
seemed
to
offer
an
explanation
it
was
noticeable
that
the
suspicious
air
with
which
everyone
had
regarded
everyone
else
was
considerably
dispelled
tom
said
nothing
until
the
others
had
withdrawn
kennedy
he
burst
out
then
do
you
believe
that
such
combustion
is
absolutely
spontaneous
do
you
believe
that
something
else
is
necessary
to
start
it
i
rather
not
express
an
opinion
just
yet
tom
answered
craig
carefully
now
if
you
can
get
harrington
and
doctor
putnam
away
from
the
house
for
a
short
time
as
you
did
with
your
uncle
and
cousin
this
morning
i
may
be
able
to
tell
you
something
about
this
case
again
kennedy
stole
into
another
bedroom
and
returned
to
our
room
with
a
just
as
he
had
done
before
he
carefully
washed
it
off
with
the
gauze
soaked
in
the
salt
solution
and
quickly
returned
the
coat
repeating
the
process
with
doctor
putnam
coat
and
last
that
of
tom
himself
finally
he
turned
his
back
while
i
sealed
the
glasses
and
marked
and
recorded
them
on
my
slip
the
next
day
was
spent
mainly
in
preparations
for
the
journey
to
new
york
with
the
body
of
lewis
langley
kennedy
was
very
busy
on
what
seemed
to
me
to
be
preparations
for
some
mysterious
chemical
experiments
i
found
myself
fully
occupied
in
keeping
special
correspondents
from
all
over
the
country
at
bay
that
evening
after
dinner
we
were
all
sitting
in
the
open
summer
house
over
the
smudges
of
green
pine
were
burning
and
smoking
on
little
artificial
islands
of
stone
near
the
lake
shore
lighting
up
the
trees
on
every
side
with
a
red
glare
tom
and
his
sister
were
seated
with
kennedy
and
myself
on
one
side
while
some
distance
from
us
harrington
was
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
with
isabelle
the
other
members
of
the
family
were
further
removed
that
seemed
typical
to
me
of
the
way
the
family
group
split
up
mr
kennedy
remarked
grace
in
a
thoughtful
low
tone
what
do
you
make
of
that
record
article
very
clever
no
doubt
replied
craig
but
do
you
think
it
strange
about
the
will
hush
whispered
tom
for
isabelle
and
harrington
had
ceased
talking
and
might
perhaps
be
listening
just
then
one
of
the
servants
came
up
with
a
telegram
tom
hastily
opened
it
and
read
the
message
eagerly
in
the
corner
of
the
summer
house
nearest
one
of
the
glowing
smudges
i
felt
instinctively
that
it
was
from
his
lawyer
he
turned
and
beckoned
to
kennedy
and
myself
what
do
you
think
of
that
he
whispered
hoarsely
we
bent
over
and
in
the
flickering
light
read
the
message
new
york
papers
full
of
spontaneous
combustion
story
record
had
exclusive
story
yesterday
but
all
papers
feature
even
more
is
it
true
please
wire
additional
details
at
once
also
immediate
instructions
regarding
loss
of
will
has
been
abstracted
from
safe
could
lewis
langley
have
taken
it
himself
unless
new
facts
soon
must
make
loss
public
or
issue
statement
lewis
langley
intestate
daniel
clark
tom
looked
blankly
at
kennedy
and
then
at
his
sister
who
was
sitting
alone
i
thought
i
could
read
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
with
all
his
faults
lewis
langley
had
been
a
good
to
his
adopted
children
but
it
was
all
over
now
if
the
will
was
lost
what
can
i
do
asked
tom
hopelessly
i
have
nothing
to
reply
to
but
i
have
quietly
returned
kennedy
deliberately
folding
up
the
message
and
handing
it
back
tell
them
all
to
be
in
the
library
in
fifteen
minutes
this
message
hurries
me
a
bit
but
i
am
prepared
you
will
have
something
to
wire
clark
after
then
he
strode
off
toward
the
house
leaving
us
to
gather
the
group
together
in
considerable
bewilderment
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
we
had
all
assembled
in
the
library
across
the
hall
from
the
room
in
which
lewis
langley
had
been
found
as
usual
kennedy
began
by
leaping
straight
into
the
middle
of
his
subject
early
in
the
eighteenth
century
he
commenced
slowly
a
woman
was
found
burned
to
death
there
were
no
clues
and
the
scientists
of
that
time
suggested
spontaneous
combustion
this
explanation
was
accepted
the
theory
always
has
been
that
the
process
of
respiration
by
which
the
tissues
of
the
body
are
used
up
and
got
rid
of
gives
the
body
a
temperature
and
it
has
seemed
that
it
may
be
possible
by
preventing
the
escape
of
this
heat
to
set
fire
to
the
we
were
leaning
forward
expectantly
horrified
by
the
thought
that
perhaps
after
all
the
record
was
correct
now
resumed
kennedy
his
tone
changing
suppose
we
try
a
little
experiment
one
that
was
tried
very
convincingly
by
the
immortal
liebig
here
is
a
sponge
i
am
going
to
soak
it
in
gin
from
this
bottle
the
same
that
langley
was
drinking
from
on
the
night
of
the
er
the
kennedy
took
the
saturated
sponge
and
placed
it
in
an
pan
from
the
kitchen
then
he
lighted
it
the
bluish
flame
shot
upward
and
in
tense
silence
we
watched
it
burn
lower
and
lower
till
all
the
alcohol
was
consumed
then
he
picked
up
the
sponge
and
passed
it
around
it
was
dry
but
the
sponge
itself
had
not
been
singed
we
now
know
he
continued
that
from
the
nature
of
combustion
it
is
impossible
for
the
human
body
to
undergo
spontaneous
ignition
or
combustion
in
the
way
the
scientific
experts
of
the
past
century
believed
swathe
the
body
in
the
thickest
of
of
heat
and
what
happens
a
profuse
perspiration
exudes
and
before
such
an
ignition
could
possibly
take
place
all
the
moisture
of
the
body
would
have
to
be
evaporated
as
per
cent
or
more
of
the
body
is
water
it
is
evident
that
enormous
heat
would
be
necessary
moisture
is
the
great
safeguard
the
experiment
which
i
have
shown
you
could
be
duplicated
with
specimens
of
human
organs
preserved
for
years
in
alcohol
in
museums
they
would
burn
just
as
this
sponge
the
specimen
itself
would
be
very
nearly
uninjured
by
the
burning
of
the
then
professor
kennedy
you
maintain
that
my
brother
did
not
meet
his
death
by
such
an
accident
asked
james
langley
exactly
that
sir
replied
craig
one
of
the
most
important
aspects
of
the
historic
faith
in
this
phenomenon
is
that
of
its
skilful
employment
in
explaining
away
what
would
otherwise
appear
to
be
convincing
circumstantial
evidence
in
cases
of
accusations
of
then
how
do
you
explain
langley
death
demanded
harrington
my
theory
of
a
spark
from
a
cigar
may
be
true
after
i
am
coming
to
that
in
a
moment
answered
kennedy
quietly
my
first
suspicion
was
aroused
by
what
not
even
doctor
putnam
seems
to
have
noticed
the
skull
of
langley
charred
and
consumed
as
it
was
seemed
to
show
marks
of
violence
it
might
have
been
from
a
fracture
of
the
skull
or
it
might
have
been
an
accident
to
his
remains
as
they
were
being
removed
to
the
anteroom
again
his
tongue
seemed
as
though
it
was
protruding
that
might
have
been
natural
suffocation
or
it
might
have
been
from
forcible
strangulation
so
far
i
had
nothing
but
conjecture
to
work
on
but
in
looking
over
the
i
found
near
the
table
on
the
hardwood
floor
a
spot
just
one
little
round
spot
now
deductions
from
spots
even
if
we
know
them
to
be
blood
must
be
made
very
carefully
i
did
not
know
this
to
be
a
and
so
was
very
careful
at
first
let
us
assume
it
was
a
however
what
did
it
show
it
was
just
a
little
regular
round
spot
quite
thick
now
drops
of
blood
falling
only
a
few
inches
usually
make
a
round
spot
with
a
smooth
border
still
the
surface
on
which
the
drop
falls
is
quite
as
much
a
factor
as
the
height
from
which
it
falls
if
the
surface
is
rough
the
border
may
be
irregular
but
this
was
a
smooth
surface
and
not
absorbent
the
thickness
of
a
dried
on
a
surface
is
less
the
greater
the
height
from
which
it
has
fallen
this
was
a
thick
spot
now
if
it
had
fallen
say
six
feet
the
height
of
langley
the
spot
would
have
been
thin
some
secondary
spatters
might
have
been
seen
or
at
least
an
irregular
edge
around
the
spot
therefore
if
it
was
a
it
had
fallen
only
one
or
two
feet
i
ascertained
next
that
the
lower
part
of
the
body
showed
no
wounds
or
bruises
whatever
tracks
of
blood
such
as
are
left
by
dragging
a
bleeding
body
differ
very
greatly
from
tracks
of
arterial
blood
which
are
left
when
the
victim
has
strength
to
move
himself
continuing
my
speculations
supposing
it
to
be
a
what
did
it
indicate
clearly
that
langley
was
struck
by
somebody
on
the
head
with
a
heavy
instrument
perhaps
in
another
part
of
the
room
that
he
was
choked
that
as
the
drops
of
blood
oozed
from
the
wound
on
his
head
he
was
dragged
across
the
floor
in
the
direction
of
the
fireplace
but
professor
kennedy
interrupted
doctor
putnam
have
you
proved
that
the
spot
was
a
might
it
not
have
been
a
or
something
of
that
sort
kennedy
had
apparently
been
waiting
for
just
such
a
question
ordinarily
water
has
no
effect
on
paint
he
answered
i
found
that
the
spot
could
be
washed
off
with
water
that
is
not
all
i
have
a
test
for
blood
that
is
so
delicately
sensitive
that
the
blood
of
an
egyptian
mummy
thousands
of
years
old
will
respond
to
it
it
was
discovered
by
a
german
scientist
doctor
uhlenhuth
and
was
no
longer
ago
than
last
winter
applied
in
england
in
connection
with
the
clapham
murder
the
suspected
murderer
declared
that
stains
on
his
clothes
were
only
spatters
of
paint
but
the
test
proved
them
to
be
spatters
of
blood
walter
bring
in
the
cage
with
the
i
opened
the
door
and
took
the
cage
from
the
groom
who
had
brought
it
up
from
the
stable
and
stood
waiting
with
it
some
distance
away
this
test
is
very
simple
doctor
putnam
continued
craig
as
i
placed
the
cage
on
the
table
and
kennedy
unwrapped
the
sterilised
a
rabbit
is
inoculated
with
human
blood
and
after
a
time
the
serum
that
is
taken
from
the
rabbit
supplies
the
material
for
the
test
i
will
insert
this
needle
in
one
of
these
rabbits
which
has
been
so
inoculated
and
will
draw
off
some
of
the
serum
which
i
place
in
this
to
the
right
the
other
rabbit
has
not
been
inoculated
i
draw
off
some
of
its
serum
and
place
that
tube
here
on
the
left
we
will
call
that
our
tube
it
will
check
the
results
of
our
tests
wrapped
up
in
this
paper
i
have
the
scrapings
of
the
spot
which
i
found
on
the
floor
just
a
few
grains
of
dark
dried
powder
to
show
how
sensitive
the
test
is
i
will
take
only
one
of
the
smallest
of
these
minute
scrapings
i
dissolve
it
in
this
third
tube
with
distilled
water
i
will
even
divide
it
in
half
and
place
the
other
half
in
this
fourth
tube
next
i
add
some
of
the
serum
of
the
uninoculated
rabbit
to
the
half
in
this
tube
you
observe
nothing
happens
i
add
a
little
of
the
serum
of
the
inoculated
rabbit
to
the
other
half
in
this
other
tube
observe
how
delicate
the
test
is
kennedy
was
leaning
forward
almost
oblivious
of
the
rest
of
us
in
the
room
talking
almost
as
if
to
himself
we
too
had
riveted
our
eyes
on
the
tubes
as
he
added
the
serum
from
the
inoculated
rabbit
a
cloudy
milky
ring
formed
almost
immediately
in
the
hitherto
colourless
very
dilute
that
concluded
craig
triumphantly
holding
the
tube
aloft
that
conclusively
proves
that
the
little
round
spot
on
the
hardwood
floor
was
not
paint
was
not
anything
in
this
wide
world
but
no
one
in
the
room
said
a
word
but
i
knew
there
must
have
been
someone
there
who
thought
volumes
in
the
few
minutes
that
elapsed
having
found
one
i
began
to
look
about
for
more
but
was
able
to
find
only
two
or
three
traces
where
spots
seemed
to
have
been
the
fact
is
that
the
blood
spots
had
been
apparently
carefully
wiped
up
that
is
an
easy
matter
hot
water
and
salt
or
hot
water
alone
or
even
cold
water
will
make
quite
short
work
of
fresh
at
least
to
all
outward
appearances
but
nothing
but
a
most
thorough
cleaning
can
conceal
them
from
the
uhlenhuth
test
even
when
they
are
apparently
wiped
out
it
is
a
case
of
lady
macbeth
over
again
crying
in
the
face
of
modern
science
out
damned
spot
i
was
able
with
sufficient
definiteness
to
trace
roughly
a
course
of
from
the
fireplace
to
a
point
near
the
door
of
the
but
beyond
the
door
in
the
hall
still
interrupted
harrington
to
get
back
to
the
facts
in
the
case
they
are
perfectly
in
accord
either
with
my
theory
of
the
cigar
or
the
record
of
spontaneous
combustion
how
do
you
account
for
the
facts
i
suppose
you
refer
to
the
charred
head
the
burned
neck
the
upper
chest
cavity
while
the
arms
and
legs
were
untouched
yes
and
then
the
body
was
found
in
the
midst
of
combustible
furniture
that
was
not
touched
it
seems
to
me
that
even
the
theory
has
considerable
support
in
spite
of
this
very
interesting
circumstantial
evidence
about
next
to
my
own
theory
the
combustion
theory
seems
most
in
harmony
with
the
if
you
will
go
over
in
your
mind
all
the
points
proved
to
have
been
discovered
not
the
added
points
in
the
record
story
i
think
you
will
agree
with
me
that
mine
is
a
more
logical
interpretation
than
spontaneous
combustion
reasoned
craig
hear
me
out
and
you
will
see
that
the
facts
are
more
in
harmony
with
my
less
fanciful
explanation
no
someone
struck
lewis
langley
down
either
in
passion
or
in
cold
blood
and
then
seeing
what
he
had
done
made
a
desperate
effort
to
destroy
the
evidence
of
violence
consider
my
next
kennedy
placed
the
five
glasses
which
i
had
carefully
sealed
and
labelled
on
the
table
before
us
the
next
step
he
said
was
to
find
out
whether
any
articles
of
clothing
in
the
house
showed
marks
that
might
be
suspected
of
being
and
here
i
must
beg
the
pardon
of
all
in
the
room
for
intruding
in
their
private
wardrobes
but
in
this
crisis
it
was
absolutely
necessary
and
under
such
circumstances
i
never
let
ceremony
stand
before
justice
in
these
five
glasses
on
the
table
i
have
the
washings
of
spots
from
the
clothing
worn
by
tom
james
langley
junior
harrington
brown
and
doctor
putnam
i
am
not
going
to
tell
you
which
is
which
indeed
i
merely
have
them
marked
and
i
do
not
know
them
myself
but
jameson
has
the
marks
with
the
names
opposite
on
a
piece
of
paper
in
his
pocket
i
am
simply
going
to
proceed
with
the
tests
to
see
if
any
of
the
stains
on
the
coats
were
of
just
then
doctor
putnam
interposed
one
question
professor
kennedy
it
is
a
comparatively
easy
thing
to
recognise
a
but
it
is
difficult
usually
impossible
to
tell
whether
the
blood
is
that
of
a
man
or
of
an
animal
i
recall
that
we
were
all
in
our
that
day
had
been
all
day
now
in
the
morning
there
had
been
an
operation
on
one
of
the
horses
at
the
stable
and
i
assisted
the
veterinary
from
town
i
may
have
got
a
spot
or
two
of
blood
on
my
coat
from
that
operation
do
i
understand
that
this
test
would
show
that
no
replied
craig
this
test
would
not
show
that
other
tests
would
but
not
this
but
if
the
spot
of
human
blood
were
less
than
the
size
of
a
it
would
show
it
would
show
if
the
spot
contained
even
so
little
as
one
of
a
gram
of
albumin
blood
from
a
horse
a
deer
a
sheep
a
pig
a
dog
could
be
obtained
but
when
the
test
was
applied
the
liquid
in
which
they
were
diluted
would
remain
clear
no
white
precipitin
as
it
is
called
would
form
but
let
human
blood
ever
so
diluted
be
added
to
the
serum
of
the
inoculated
rabbit
and
the
test
is
a
silence
seemed
to
pervade
the
room
kennedy
slowly
and
deliberately
began
to
test
the
contents
of
the
glasses
dropping
into
each
as
he
broke
the
seal
some
of
the
serum
of
the
rabbit
he
waited
a
moment
to
see
if
any
change
occurred
it
was
thrilling
i
think
no
one
could
have
gone
through
that
fifteen
minutes
without
having
it
indelibly
impressed
on
his
memory
i
recall
thinking
as
kennedy
took
each
glass
which
is
it
to
be
guilt
or
innocence
life
or
death
could
it
be
possible
that
a
man
life
might
hang
on
such
a
slender
thread
i
knew
kennedy
was
too
accurate
and
serious
to
deceive
us
it
was
not
only
possible
it
was
actually
a
fact
the
first
glass
showed
no
reaction
someone
had
been
vindicated
the
second
was
neutral
likewise
another
person
in
the
room
had
been
proved
innocent
the
third
no
change
science
had
released
a
third
the
fourth
almost
it
seemed
as
if
the
record
in
my
pocket
burned
spontaneously
so
intense
was
my
feeling
there
in
the
glass
was
that
fatal
telltale
white
precipitate
my
god
it
the
milk
ring
whispered
tom
close
to
my
ear
hastily
kennedy
dropped
the
serum
into
the
fifth
it
remained
as
clear
as
crystal
my
hand
trembled
as
it
touched
the
envelope
containing
my
record
of
the
names
the
person
who
wore
the
coat
with
that
on
it
declared
kennedy
solemnly
was
the
person
who
struck
lewis
langley
down
who
choked
him
and
then
dragged
his
scarcely
dead
body
across
the
floor
and
obliterated
the
marks
of
violence
in
the
blazing
log
fire
jameson
whose
name
is
opposite
the
sign
on
this
glass
i
could
scarcely
tear
the
seal
to
look
at
the
paper
in
the
envelope
at
last
i
unfolded
it
and
my
eye
fell
on
the
name
opposite
the
fatal
sign
but
my
mouth
was
dry
and
my
tongue
refused
to
move
it
was
too
much
like
reading
a
with
my
finger
on
the
name
i
faltered
an
instant
tom
leaned
over
my
shoulder
and
read
it
to
himself
for
heaven
sake
jameson
he
cried
let
the
ladies
retire
before
you
read
the
it
not
necessary
said
a
thick
voice
we
quarrelled
over
the
estate
my
share
mortgaged
up
to
the
limit
and
lewis
refused
to
lend
me
more
even
until
i
could
get
isabelle
happily
married
now
goes
to
an
outsider
harrington
boy
take
care
of
isabelle
fortune
or
no
fortune
good
someone
seized
james
langley
arm
as
he
pressed
an
automatic
revolver
to
his
temple
he
reeled
like
a
drunken
man
and
dropped
the
gun
on
the
floor
with
an
oath
beaten
again
he
muttered
forgot
to
move
the
ratchet
from
to
like
a
madman
he
wrenched
himself
loose
from
us
sprang
through
the
door
and
darted
upstairs
i
show
you
some
combustion
he
shouted
back
fiercely
kennedy
was
after
him
like
a
flash
the
will
he
cried
we
literally
tore
the
door
off
its
hinges
and
burst
into
james
room
he
was
bending
eagerly
over
the
fireplace
kennedy
made
a
flying
leap
at
him
just
enough
of
the
will
was
left
unburned
to
be
admitted
to
probate
ix
the
terror
in
the
air
there
something
queer
about
these
aeroplane
accidents
at
belmore
park
mused
kennedy
one
evening
as
his
eye
caught
a
big
headline
in
the
last
edition
of
the
star
which
i
had
brought
uptown
with
me
queer
i
echoed
unfortunate
terrible
but
hardly
queer
why
it
is
a
common
saying
among
the
aeronauts
that
if
they
keep
at
it
long
enough
they
will
all
lose
their
yes
i
know
that
rejoined
kennedy
but
walter
have
you
noticed
that
all
these
accidents
have
happened
to
norton
new
gyroscope
machines
well
what
of
that
i
replied
is
it
just
barely
possible
that
norton
is
on
the
wrong
track
in
applying
the
gyroscope
to
an
aeroplane
i
ca
say
i
know
much
about
either
the
gyroscope
or
the
aeroplane
but
from
what
i
hear
the
fellows
at
the
office
say
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
gyroscope
is
a
pretty
good
thing
to
keep
off
an
aeroplane
not
to
put
on
why
asked
kennedy
blandly
well
it
seems
to
me
from
what
the
experts
say
that
anything
which
tends
to
keep
your
machine
in
one
position
is
just
what
you
do
want
in
an
aeroplane
what
surprises
them
they
say
is
that
the
thing
seems
to
work
so
well
up
to
a
certain
point
that
the
accidents
do
happen
sooner
why
our
man
on
the
aviation
field
tells
me
that
when
that
poor
fellow
browne
was
killed
he
had
all
but
succeeded
in
bringing
his
machine
to
a
dead
stop
in
the
air
in
other
words
he
would
have
won
the
brooks
prize
for
perfect
motionlessness
in
one
place
and
then
herrick
the
day
before
was
going
about
seventy
miles
an
hour
when
he
collapsed
they
said
it
was
heart
failure
but
another
expert
says
in
the
star
here
i
read
it
real
cause
was
poisoning
due
to
the
pressure
on
the
mouth
from
driving
fast
through
the
air
and
the
consequent
inability
to
expel
the
poisoned
air
which
had
been
breathed
air
once
breathed
is
practically
when
one
is
passing
rapidly
through
the
air
this
is
pushed
back
into
the
lungs
and
only
a
little
can
get
away
because
of
the
rush
of
air
pressure
into
the
mouth
so
it
is
rebreathed
and
the
result
is
gradual
poisoning
which
produces
a
kind
of
narcotic
sleep
then
it
was
the
gyroscope
in
that
case
said
kennedy
with
a
rising
inflection
no
i
admitted
reluctantly
perhaps
i
could
see
that
i
had
been
rash
in
talking
so
long
kennedy
had
only
been
sounding
me
to
see
what
the
newspapers
thought
of
it
his
next
remark
was
characteristic
norton
has
asked
me
to
look
into
the
thing
he
said
quietly
if
his
invention
is
a
failure
he
is
a
ruined
man
all
his
money
is
in
it
he
is
suing
a
man
for
infringing
on
his
patent
and
he
is
liable
for
damages
to
the
heirs
according
to
his
agreement
with
browne
and
herrick
i
have
known
norton
some
time
in
fact
he
worked
out
his
ideas
at
the
university
physical
laboratory
i
have
flown
in
his
machine
and
it
is
the
most
marvellous
biplane
i
ever
saw
walter
i
want
you
to
get
a
belmore
park
assignment
from
the
star
and
go
out
to
the
aviation
meet
with
me
i
take
you
on
the
field
around
the
machines
you
can
get
enough
local
colour
to
do
a
dozen
star
specials
later
on
i
may
add
that
devising
a
capable
of
remaining
stationary
in
the
air
means
a
revolution
that
will
relegate
all
other
machines
to
the
from
a
military
point
of
view
it
is
the
one
thing
necessary
to
make
the
aeroplane
the
superior
in
every
respect
to
the
the
regular
contests
did
not
begin
until
the
afternoon
but
kennedy
and
i
decided
to
make
a
day
of
it
and
early
the
next
morning
we
were
speeding
out
to
the
park
where
the
flights
were
being
held
we
found
charles
norton
the
inventor
anxiously
at
work
with
his
mechanicians
in
the
big
temporary
shed
that
had
been
accorded
him
and
was
dignified
with
the
name
of
hangar
i
knew
you
would
come
professor
he
exclaimed
running
forward
to
meet
us
of
course
echoed
kennedy
i
too
much
interested
in
this
invention
of
yours
not
to
help
you
norton
you
know
what
i
always
thought
of
it
i
told
you
often
that
it
is
the
most
important
advance
since
the
original
discovery
by
the
wrights
that
the
aeroplane
could
be
balanced
by
warping
the
i
just
fixing
up
my
third
machine
said
norton
if
anything
happens
to
it
i
shall
lose
the
prize
at
least
as
far
as
this
meet
is
concerned
for
i
do
believe
i
shall
get
my
fourth
and
newest
model
from
the
makers
in
time
anyhow
if
i
did
i
could
pay
for
it
i
am
ruined
if
i
do
win
that
brooks
prize
and
besides
a
couple
of
army
men
are
coming
to
inspect
my
aeroplane
and
report
to
the
war
department
on
it
i
have
stood
a
good
chance
of
selling
it
i
think
if
my
flights
here
had
been
like
the
trials
you
saw
but
kennedy
he
added
and
his
face
was
drawn
and
tragic
drop
the
whole
thing
if
i
did
know
i
was
right
two
men
dead
think
of
it
why
even
the
newspapers
are
beginning
to
call
me
a
cold
heartless
scientific
crank
to
keep
on
but
i
show
them
this
afternoon
i
going
to
fly
myself
i
not
afraid
to
go
anywhere
i
send
my
men
i
die
before
i
admit
i
it
was
easy
to
see
why
kennedy
was
fascinated
by
a
man
of
type
anyone
would
have
been
it
was
not
foolhardiness
it
was
dogged
determination
faith
in
himself
and
in
his
own
ability
to
triumph
over
every
obstacle
we
now
slowly
entered
the
shed
where
two
men
were
working
over
biplane
one
of
the
men
was
a
frenchman
jaurette
who
had
worked
with
farman
a
silent
weatherbeaten
fellow
with
a
sort
of
sullen
politeness
the
other
man
was
an
american
roy
sinclair
a
tall
lithe
wiry
chap
with
a
seamed
and
furrowed
face
and
a
but
very
deft
manner
which
marked
him
a
born
norton
third
aviator
humphreys
who
was
not
to
fly
that
day
much
to
his
relief
was
reading
a
paper
in
the
back
of
the
shed
we
were
introduced
to
him
and
be
seemed
to
be
a
very
companionable
sort
of
fellow
though
not
given
to
talking
mr
norton
he
said
after
the
introduction
there
quite
an
account
of
your
injunction
against
delanne
in
this
paper
it
does
seem
to
be
very
friendly
he
added
indicating
the
article
norton
read
it
and
frowned
humph
i
show
them
yet
that
my
application
of
the
gyroscope
is
patentable
delanne
will
put
me
into
in
the
patent
office
as
the
lawyers
call
it
will
he
well
i
filed
a
over
a
year
and
a
half
ago
if
i
wrong
wrong
and
all
gyroscope
patents
are
wrong
and
if
i
right
by
george
i
first
in
the
field
that
so
is
it
he
appealed
to
kennedy
kennedy
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
if
he
had
never
heard
of
the
patent
office
or
the
gyroscope
in
his
life
the
men
were
listening
whether
or
not
from
loyalty
i
could
not
tell
let
us
see
your
gyroplane
i
mean
aeroscope
whatever
it
is
you
call
it
asked
kennedy
norton
took
the
cue
now
you
newspaper
men
are
the
first
that
allowed
in
here
he
said
can
i
trust
your
word
of
honour
not
to
publish
a
line
except
such
as
i
after
you
write
it
we
promised
as
norton
directed
the
mechanicians
wheeled
the
aeroplane
out
on
the
field
in
front
of
the
shed
no
one
was
about
now
this
is
the
gyroscope
began
norton
pointing
out
a
thing
encased
in
an
aluminum
sheath
which
weighed
all
told
perhaps
fourteen
or
fifteen
pounds
you
see
the
gyroscope
is
really
a
flywheel
mounted
on
gimbals
and
can
turn
on
any
of
its
angles
so
that
it
can
assume
any
angle
in
space
when
it
at
rest
like
this
you
can
turn
it
easily
but
when
set
revolving
it
tends
to
persist
always
in
the
plane
in
which
it
was
started
i
took
hold
of
it
and
it
did
turn
readily
in
any
direction
i
could
feel
the
heavy
little
flywheel
inside
there
is
a
pretty
high
vacuum
in
that
aluminum
case
went
on
norton
there
very
little
friction
on
that
account
the
power
to
rotate
the
flywheel
is
obtained
from
this
little
dynamo
here
run
by
the
which
also
turns
the
propellers
of
the
but
suppose
the
engine
stops
how
about
the
gyroscope
i
asked
sceptically
it
will
go
right
on
for
several
minutes
you
know
the
brennan
monorail
car
will
stand
up
some
time
after
the
power
is
shut
off
and
i
carry
a
small
that
will
run
it
for
some
time
too
that
all
been
guarded
jaurette
cranked
the
engine
a
affair
with
the
cylinders
sticking
out
like
the
spokes
of
a
wheel
without
a
rim
the
propellers
turned
so
fast
that
i
could
not
see
the
blades
turned
with
that
strong
steady
fierce
droning
buzz
that
can
be
heard
a
long
distance
and
which
is
a
thrilling
sound
to
hear
norton
reached
over
and
attached
the
little
dynamo
at
the
same
time
setting
the
gyroscope
at
its
proper
angle
and
starting
it
this
is
the
mechanical
brain
of
my
new
flier
he
remarked
patting
the
aluminum
case
lovingly
you
can
look
in
through
this
little
window
in
the
case
and
see
the
flywheel
inside
revolving
ten
thousand
revolutions
a
minute
press
down
on
the
gyroscope
he
shouted
to
me
as
i
placed
both
hands
on
the
case
of
the
apparently
frail
little
instrument
he
added
you
remember
how
easily
you
moved
it
just
a
moment
i
pressed
down
with
all
my
might
then
i
literally
raised
myself
off
my
feet
and
my
whole
weight
was
on
the
gyroscope
that
uncanny
little
instrument
seemed
to
resent
yes
that
the
word
resent
my
touch
it
was
almost
human
in
the
resentment
too
far
from
yielding
to
me
it
actually
rose
on
the
side
i
was
pressing
down
the
men
who
were
watching
me
laughed
at
the
puzzled
look
on
my
face
i
took
my
hands
off
and
the
gyroscope
leisurely
and
nonchalantly
went
back
to
its
original
position
that
the
property
we
use
applied
to
the
rudder
and
the
ailerons
those
flat
planes
between
the
large
main
planes
that
gives
automatic
stability
to
the
machine
continued
norton
i
not
going
to
explain
how
it
is
done
it
is
in
the
combination
of
the
various
parts
that
i
have
discovered
the
basic
principle
and
i
not
going
to
talk
about
it
till
the
thing
is
settled
by
the
courts
but
it
is
there
and
the
court
will
see
it
and
i
prove
that
delanne
is
a
fraud
a
fraud
when
he
says
that
my
combination
is
patentable
and
is
practicable
even
at
that
the
truth
is
that
his
device
as
it
stands
practicable
and
besides
if
he
makes
it
so
it
infringes
on
mine
would
you
like
to
take
a
flight
with
me
i
looked
at
kennedy
and
a
vision
of
the
wreckage
of
the
two
previous
accidents
as
the
star
photographer
had
snapped
them
flashed
across
my
mind
but
kennedy
was
too
quick
for
me
yes
he
answered
a
short
flight
no
we
took
our
seats
by
norton
i
at
least
with
some
misgiving
gently
the
machine
rose
into
the
air
the
sensation
was
delightful
the
fresh
air
of
the
morning
came
with
a
stinging
rush
to
my
face
below
i
could
see
the
earth
sweeping
past
as
if
it
were
a
film
above
the
continuous
roar
of
the
engine
and
propeller
norton
indicated
to
kennedy
the
automatic
balancing
of
the
gyroscope
as
it
bent
the
ailerons
could
you
fly
in
this
machine
without
the
gyroscope
at
all
yelled
kennedy
the
noise
was
deafening
conversation
almost
impossible
though
sitting
side
by
side
he
had
to
repeat
his
remark
twice
to
norton
yes
called
back
norton
reaching
back
of
him
he
pointed
out
the
way
to
detach
the
gyroscope
and
put
a
sort
of
brake
on
it
that
stopped
its
revolutions
almost
instantly
it
a
ticklish
job
to
change
in
the
air
he
shouted
it
can
be
done
but
it
safer
to
land
and
do
the
flight
was
soon
over
and
we
stood
admiring
the
machine
while
norton
expatiated
on
the
compactness
of
his
little
dynamo
what
have
you
done
with
the
wrecks
of
the
other
machines
inquired
kennedy
at
length
they
are
stored
in
a
shed
down
near
the
railroad
station
they
are
just
a
mass
of
junk
though
there
are
some
parts
that
i
can
use
so
i
ship
them
back
to
the
might
i
have
a
look
at
them
surely
i
give
you
the
key
sorry
i
ca
go
myself
but
i
want
to
be
sure
everything
is
all
right
for
my
flight
this
it
was
a
long
walk
over
to
the
shed
near
the
station
and
together
with
our
examination
of
the
wrecked
machines
it
took
us
the
rest
of
the
morning
craig
carefully
turned
over
the
wreckage
it
seemed
a
hopeless
quest
to
me
but
i
fancied
that
to
him
it
merely
presented
new
problems
for
his
deductive
and
scientific
mind
these
gyroscopes
are
out
of
business
for
good
he
remarked
as
he
glanced
at
the
dented
and
battered
aluminum
cases
but
there
seem
to
be
anything
wrong
with
them
except
what
would
naturally
happen
in
such
for
my
part
i
felt
a
sort
of
awe
at
the
mass
of
wreckage
in
which
browne
and
herrick
had
been
killed
it
was
to
me
more
than
a
tangled
mass
of
wires
and
splinters
two
human
lives
had
been
snuffed
out
in
it
the
engines
are
a
mass
of
scrap
see
how
the
cylinders
are
bent
and
twisted
remarked
kennedy
with
great
interest
the
is
intact
but
dented
out
of
shape
no
explosion
there
and
look
at
this
dynamo
why
the
wires
in
it
are
actually
fused
together
the
insulation
has
been
completely
burned
off
i
wonder
what
could
have
caused
that
kennedy
continued
to
regard
the
tangled
mass
thoughtfully
for
some
time
then
locked
the
door
and
we
strolled
back
to
the
grand
stand
on
our
side
of
the
field
already
the
crowd
had
begun
to
collect
across
the
field
we
could
see
the
various
machines
in
front
of
their
hangars
with
the
men
working
on
them
the
buzz
of
the
engines
was
wafted
across
by
the
light
summer
breeze
as
if
a
thousand
cicadas
had
broken
loose
to
predict
warm
weather
two
machines
were
already
in
flight
a
little
yellow
demoiselle
scurrying
around
close
to
the
earth
like
a
frightened
hen
and
a
bleriot
high
overhead
making
slow
and
graceful
turns
like
a
huge
bird
kennedy
and
i
stopped
before
the
little
wireless
telegraph
station
of
the
signal
corps
in
front
of
the
grand
stand
and
watched
the
operator
working
over
his
instruments
there
it
is
again
muttered
the
operator
angrily
what
the
matter
asked
kennedy
amateurs
interfering
with
you
the
man
nodded
a
reply
shaking
his
head
with
the
receiver
viciously
he
continued
to
adjust
his
apparatus
confound
it
he
exclaimed
yes
that
fellow
has
been
jamming
me
for
the
past
two
days
off
and
on
every
time
i
get
ready
to
send
or
receive
a
message
williams
is
going
up
with
a
wright
machine
equipped
with
wireless
apparatus
in
a
minute
and
this
fellow
wo
get
out
of
the
way
by
jove
though
those
are
powerful
impulses
of
his
hear
that
crackling
i
never
been
interfered
with
so
in
my
experience
touch
that
screen
door
with
your
kennedy
did
so
and
elicited
large
sparks
with
quite
a
tingle
of
a
shock
yesterday
and
the
day
before
it
was
so
bad
we
had
to
give
up
attempting
to
communicate
with
williams
continued
the
operator
it
was
worse
than
trying
to
work
in
a
that
the
time
we
get
our
troubles
when
the
air
is
overcharged
with
electricity
as
it
is
that
interesting
remarked
kennedy
interesting
flashed
back
the
operator
angrily
noting
the
condition
in
his
log
maybe
it
is
but
i
call
it
darned
mean
it
almost
like
trying
to
work
in
a
power
indeed
queried
kennedy
i
beg
your
pardon
i
was
only
looking
at
it
from
the
purely
scientific
point
of
view
who
is
it
do
you
suppose
how
do
i
know
some
amateur
i
guess
no
professional
would
butt
in
this
kennedy
took
a
leaf
out
of
his
and
wrote
a
short
message
which
he
gave
to
a
boy
to
deliver
to
norton
detach
your
gyroscope
and
dynamo
it
read
leave
them
in
the
hangar
fly
without
them
this
afternoon
and
see
what
happens
no
use
to
try
for
the
prize
we
sauntered
out
on
the
open
part
of
the
field
back
of
the
fence
and
to
the
side
of
the
stands
and
watched
the
fliers
for
a
few
moments
three
were
in
the
air
now
and
i
could
see
norton
and
his
men
getting
ready
the
boy
with
the
message
was
going
rapidly
across
the
field
kennedy
was
impatiently
watching
him
it
was
too
far
off
to
see
just
what
they
were
doing
but
as
norton
seemed
to
get
down
out
of
his
seat
in
the
aeroplane
when
the
boy
arrived
and
it
was
wheeled
back
into
the
shed
i
gathered
that
he
was
detaching
the
gyroscope
and
was
going
to
make
the
flight
without
it
as
kennedy
had
requested
in
a
few
minutes
it
was
again
wheeled
out
the
crowd
which
had
been
waiting
especially
to
see
norton
applauded
come
walter
exclaimed
kennedy
let
go
up
there
on
the
roof
of
the
stand
where
we
can
see
better
there
a
platform
and
railing
i
his
pass
allowed
him
to
go
anywhere
on
the
field
so
in
a
few
moments
we
were
up
on
the
roof
it
was
a
fascinating
and
i
was
so
deeply
engrossed
between
watching
the
crowd
below
the
in
the
air
and
the
machines
waiting
across
the
field
that
i
totally
neglected
to
notice
what
kennedy
was
doing
when
i
did
i
saw
that
he
had
deliberately
turned
his
back
on
the
aviation
field
and
was
anxiously
scanning
the
country
back
of
us
what
are
you
looking
for
i
asked
turn
around
i
think
norton
is
just
about
to
watch
him
then
answered
craig
tell
me
when
he
gets
in
the
just
then
norton
aeroplane
rose
gently
from
the
field
a
wild
shout
of
applause
came
from
the
people
below
us
at
the
heroism
of
the
man
who
dared
to
fly
this
new
and
apparently
fated
machine
it
was
succeeded
by
a
breathless
deathly
calm
as
if
after
the
first
burst
of
enthusiasm
the
crowd
had
suddenly
realised
the
danger
of
the
intrepid
aviator
would
norton
add
a
third
to
the
fatalities
of
the
meet
suddenly
kennedy
jerked
my
arm
walter
look
over
there
across
the
road
back
of
us
at
the
old
weatherbeaten
barn
i
mean
the
one
next
to
that
yellow
house
what
do
you
see
nothing
except
that
on
the
peak
of
the
roof
there
is
a
pole
that
looks
like
the
short
stub
of
a
small
wireless
mast
i
should
say
there
was
a
boy
connected
with
that
barn
a
boy
who
has
read
a
book
on
wireless
for
maybe
said
kennedy
but
is
that
all
you
see
look
up
in
the
little
window
of
the
gable
the
one
with
the
closed
i
looked
carefully
it
seems
to
me
that
i
saw
a
gleam
of
something
bright
at
the
top
of
the
shutter
craig
i
ventured
a
spark
or
a
it
must
be
a
bright
spark
for
the
sun
is
shining
brightly
mused
craig
oh
maybe
it
the
small
boy
with
a
i
can
remember
when
i
used
to
get
behind
such
a
window
and
shine
a
glass
into
the
darkened
room
of
my
neighbours
across
the
i
had
really
said
that
half
in
raillery
for
i
was
at
a
loss
to
account
in
any
other
way
for
the
light
but
i
was
surprised
to
see
how
eagerly
craig
accepted
it
perhaps
you
are
right
in
a
way
he
assented
i
guess
it
is
a
spark
after
all
yes
it
must
be
the
reflection
of
the
sun
on
a
piece
of
glass
the
angles
are
just
about
right
for
it
anyhow
it
caught
my
eye
still
i
believe
that
barn
will
bear
whatever
his
suspicions
craig
kept
them
to
himself
and
descended
at
the
same
time
norton
gently
dropped
back
to
earth
in
front
of
his
hangar
not
ten
feet
from
the
spot
where
he
started
the
applause
was
deafening
as
the
machine
was
again
wheeled
into
the
shed
safely
kennedy
and
i
pushed
through
the
crowd
to
the
wireless
operator
how
she
working
inquired
craig
rotten
replied
the
operator
sullenly
it
was
worse
than
ever
about
five
minutes
ago
it
much
better
now
almost
normal
just
then
the
who
had
been
hunting
through
the
crowd
for
us
handed
kennedy
a
note
it
was
merely
a
scrawl
from
norton
everything
seems
fine
am
going
to
try
her
next
with
the
gyroscope
boy
exclaimed
craig
has
cdr
norton
a
telephone
no
sir
only
that
hangar
at
the
end
has
a
well
you
run
across
that
field
as
fast
as
your
legs
can
carry
you
and
tell
him
if
he
values
his
life
not
to
do
not
to
do
what
sir
do
stand
there
youngster
run
tell
him
not
to
fly
with
that
gyroscope
there
a
in
it
if
you
get
over
there
before
he
even
as
he
spoke
the
norton
aeroplane
was
wheeled
out
again
in
a
minute
norton
had
climbed
up
into
his
seat
and
was
testing
the
levers
would
the
boy
reach
him
in
time
he
was
half
across
the
field
waving
his
arms
like
mad
but
apparently
norton
and
his
men
were
too
engrossed
in
their
machine
to
pay
attention
good
heavens
exclaimed
craig
he
going
to
try
it
run
boy
run
he
cried
although
the
boy
was
now
far
out
of
hearing
across
the
field
we
could
hear
now
the
quick
staccato
of
the
engine
slowly
norton
aeroplane
this
time
really
equipped
with
the
gyroscope
rose
from
the
field
and
circled
over
toward
us
craig
frantically
signalled
to
him
to
come
down
but
of
course
norton
could
not
have
seen
him
in
the
crowd
as
for
the
crowd
they
looked
askance
at
kennedy
as
if
he
had
taken
leave
of
his
senses
i
heard
the
wireless
operator
cursing
the
way
his
receiver
was
acting
higher
and
higher
norton
went
in
one
spiral
after
another
those
spirals
which
his
gyroscope
had
already
made
famous
the
man
with
the
megaphone
in
front
of
the
judge
stand
announced
in
hollow
tones
that
norton
had
given
notice
that
he
would
try
for
the
brooks
prize
for
stationary
equilibrium
kennedy
and
i
stood
speechless
helpless
appalled
slower
and
slower
went
the
aeroplane
it
seemed
to
hover
just
like
the
big
mechanical
bird
that
it
was
kennedy
was
anxiously
watching
the
judges
with
one
eye
and
norton
with
the
other
a
few
in
the
crowd
could
no
longer
restrain
their
applause
i
remember
that
the
wireless
back
of
us
was
spluttering
and
crackling
like
mad
all
of
a
sudden
a
groan
swept
over
the
crowd
something
was
wrong
with
norton
his
aeroplane
was
swooping
downward
at
a
terrific
rate
would
he
be
able
to
control
it
i
held
my
breath
and
gripped
kennedy
by
the
arm
down
down
came
norton
frantically
fighting
by
main
strength
it
seemed
to
me
to
warp
the
planes
so
that
their
surface
might
catch
the
air
and
check
his
descent
he
trying
to
detach
the
gyroscope
whispered
craig
hoarsely
the
football
helmet
which
norton
wore
blew
off
and
fell
more
rapidly
than
the
plane
i
shut
my
eyes
but
kennedy
next
exclamation
caused
me
quickly
to
open
them
again
he
make
it
after
all
somehow
norton
had
regained
partial
control
of
his
machine
but
it
was
still
swooping
down
at
a
tremendous
pace
toward
the
level
centre
of
the
field
there
was
a
crash
as
it
struck
the
ground
in
a
cloud
of
dust
with
a
leap
kennedy
had
cleared
the
fence
and
was
running
toward
norton
two
men
from
the
judge
stand
were
ahead
of
us
but
except
for
them
we
were
the
first
to
reach
him
the
men
were
tearing
frantically
at
the
tangled
framework
trying
to
lift
it
off
norton
who
lay
pale
and
motionless
pinned
under
it
the
machine
was
not
so
badly
damaged
after
all
but
that
together
we
could
lift
it
bodily
off
him
a
doctor
ran
out
from
the
crowd
and
hastily
put
his
ear
to
chest
no
one
spoke
but
we
all
scanned
the
doctor
face
anxiously
just
stunned
he
be
all
right
in
a
moment
get
some
water
he
said
kennedy
pulled
my
arm
look
at
the
gyroscope
dynamo
he
whispered
i
looked
like
the
other
two
which
we
had
seen
it
also
was
a
wreck
the
insulation
was
burned
off
the
wires
the
wires
were
fused
together
and
the
looked
as
if
it
had
been
burned
out
a
flicker
of
the
eyelid
and
norton
seemed
to
regain
some
degree
of
consciousness
he
was
living
over
again
the
ages
that
had
passed
during
the
seconds
of
his
terrible
fall
will
they
never
stop
oh
those
sparks
those
sparks
i
disconnect
it
sparks
more
sparks
will
they
never
so
he
rambled
on
it
was
fearsome
to
hear
him
but
kennedy
was
now
sure
that
norton
was
safe
and
in
good
hands
and
he
hurried
back
in
the
direction
of
the
grand
stand
i
followed
flying
was
over
for
that
day
and
the
people
were
filing
slowly
out
toward
the
railroad
station
where
the
special
trains
were
waiting
we
stopped
at
the
wireless
station
for
a
moment
is
it
true
that
norton
will
recover
inquired
the
operator
yes
he
was
only
stunned
thank
heaven
did
you
keep
a
record
of
the
antics
of
your
receiver
since
i
saw
you
last
yes
sir
and
i
made
a
copy
for
you
by
the
way
it
working
all
right
now
when
i
do
want
it
if
williams
was
only
in
the
air
now
i
give
you
a
good
demonstration
of
communicating
with
an
aeroplane
continued
the
operator
as
he
prepared
to
leave
kennedy
thanked
him
for
the
record
and
carefully
folded
it
joining
the
crowd
we
pushed
our
way
out
but
instead
of
going
down
to
the
station
with
them
kennedy
turned
toward
the
barn
and
the
yellow
house
for
some
time
we
waited
about
casually
but
nothing
occurred
at
length
kennedy
walked
up
to
the
shed
the
door
was
closed
and
double
padlocked
he
knocked
but
there
was
no
answer
just
then
a
man
appeared
on
the
porch
of
the
yellow
house
seeing
us
he
beckoned
as
we
approached
he
shouted
he
gone
for
the
day
has
he
a
city
address
any
place
i
could
reach
him
asked
craig
i
do
know
he
hired
the
barn
from
me
for
two
weeks
and
paid
in
advance
he
told
me
if
i
wanted
to
address
him
the
best
way
was
lamar
general
delivery
new
york
city
ah
then
i
suppose
i
had
better
write
to
him
said
kennedy
apparently
much
gratified
to
learn
the
name
i
presume
he
be
taking
away
his
apparatus
soon
ca
say
there
enough
of
it
cy
smith
he
in
the
electric
light
company
up
to
the
village
says
the
doctor
has
used
a
powerful
lot
of
current
he
good
pay
though
he
awful
closemouthed
flying
over
for
ai
it
was
that
feller
much
hurt
no
he
be
all
right
i
think
he
fly
again
the
machine
in
pretty
good
condition
he
bound
to
win
that
prize
as
he
walked
away
i
remarked
how
do
you
know
norton
will
fly
again
i
do
answered
kennedy
but
i
think
that
either
he
or
humphreys
will
i
wanted
to
see
that
this
lamar
believes
it
anyhow
by
the
way
walter
do
you
think
you
could
grab
a
wire
here
and
in
a
story
to
the
star
that
norton
is
much
hurt
and
will
probably
be
able
to
fly
try
to
get
the
city
news
association
too
so
that
all
the
papers
will
have
it
i
do
care
about
risking
the
general
delivery
perhaps
lamar
wo
call
for
any
mail
but
he
certainly
will
read
the
papers
put
it
in
the
form
of
an
interview
with
norton
see
that
it
is
all
right
and
that
there
is
no
norton
will
stand
for
it
when
i
tell
him
my
i
caught
the
star
just
in
time
for
the
last
edition
and
some
of
the
other
papers
that
had
later
editions
also
had
the
story
of
course
all
the
morning
papers
had
it
norton
spent
the
night
in
the
mineola
hospital
he
did
really
need
to
stay
but
the
doctor
said
it
would
be
best
in
case
some
internal
injury
had
been
overlooked
meanwhile
kennedy
took
charge
of
the
hangar
where
the
injured
machine
was
the
men
had
been
in
a
sort
of
panic
humphrey
could
not
be
found
and
the
only
reason
i
think
why
the
two
mechanicians
stayed
was
because
something
was
due
them
on
their
pay
kennedy
wrote
them
out
personal
checks
for
their
respective
amounts
but
dated
them
two
days
ahead
to
insure
their
staying
he
threw
off
all
disguise
now
and
with
authority
from
norton
directed
the
repairing
of
the
machine
fortunately
it
was
in
pretty
good
condition
the
broken
part
was
the
skids
not
the
essential
parts
of
the
machine
as
for
the
gyroscope
there
were
plenty
of
them
and
another
dynamo
and
it
was
a
very
simple
thing
to
replace
the
old
one
that
had
been
destroyed
sinclair
worked
with
a
will
far
past
his
regular
hours
jaurette
also
worked
though
one
could
hardly
say
with
a
will
in
fact
most
of
the
work
was
done
by
sinclair
and
kennedy
with
jaurette
sullenly
grumbling
mostly
in
french
under
his
breath
i
did
not
like
the
fellow
and
was
suspicious
of
him
i
thought
i
noticed
that
kennedy
did
not
allow
him
to
do
much
of
the
work
either
though
that
may
have
been
for
the
reason
that
kennedy
never
asked
anyone
to
help
him
who
seemed
unwilling
there
exclaimed
craig
about
ten
if
we
want
to
get
back
to
the
city
in
any
kind
of
time
we
had
better
quit
sinclair
i
think
you
can
finish
repairing
these
skids
in
the
we
locked
up
the
hangar
and
hurried
across
to
the
station
it
was
late
when
we
arrived
in
new
york
but
kennedy
insisted
on
posting
off
up
to
his
laboratory
leaving
me
to
run
down
to
the
star
office
to
make
sure
that
our
story
was
all
right
for
the
morning
papers
i
did
not
see
him
until
morning
when
a
large
drove
up
kennedy
routed
me
out
of
bed
in
the
tonneau
of
the
car
was
a
huge
package
carefully
wrapped
up
something
i
worked
on
for
a
couple
of
hours
last
night
explained
craig
patting
it
if
this
does
solve
the
problem
then
i
give
it
i
was
burning
with
curiosity
but
somehow
by
a
perverse
association
of
ideas
i
merely
reproached
kennedy
for
not
taking
enough
rest
oh
he
smiled
if
i
had
been
working
last
night
walter
i
could
have
rested
at
all
for
thinking
about
when
we
arrived
at
the
field
norton
was
already
there
with
his
head
bandaged
i
thought
him
a
little
pale
but
otherwise
all
right
jaurette
was
sulking
but
sinclair
had
finished
the
repairs
and
was
busily
engaged
in
going
over
every
bolt
and
wire
humphreys
had
sent
word
that
he
had
another
offer
and
had
not
shown
up
we
must
find
him
exclaimed
kennedy
i
want
him
to
make
a
flight
his
contract
calls
for
i
can
do
it
kennedy
asserted
norton
see
i
all
he
picked
up
two
pieces
of
wire
and
held
them
at
arm
length
bringing
them
together
tip
to
tip
in
front
of
him
just
to
show
us
how
he
could
control
his
nerves
and
i
be
better
yet
by
this
afternoon
he
added
i
can
do
that
stunt
with
the
points
of
pins
kennedy
shook
his
head
gravely
but
norton
insisted
and
finally
kennedy
agreed
to
give
up
wasting
time
trying
to
locate
humphreys
after
that
he
and
norton
had
a
long
whispered
conference
in
which
kennedy
seemed
to
be
unfolding
a
scheme
i
understand
said
norton
at
length
you
want
me
to
put
this
cover
over
the
dynamo
and
battery
first
then
you
want
me
to
take
the
cover
off
and
also
to
detach
the
gyroscope
and
to
fly
without
using
it
is
that
it
yes
assented
craig
i
will
be
on
the
roof
of
the
grand
stand
the
signal
will
be
three
waves
of
my
hat
repeated
till
i
see
you
get
after
a
quick
luncheon
we
went
up
to
our
on
the
way
kennedy
had
spoken
to
the
head
of
the
pinkertons
engaged
by
the
management
for
the
meet
and
had
also
dropped
in
to
see
the
wireless
operator
to
ask
him
to
send
up
a
messenger
if
he
saw
the
same
phenomena
as
he
had
observed
the
day
before
on
the
roof
kennedy
took
from
his
pocket
a
little
instrument
with
a
needle
which
trembled
back
and
forth
over
a
dial
it
was
nearing
the
time
for
the
start
of
the
day
flying
and
the
aeroplanes
were
getting
ready
kennedy
was
calmly
biting
a
cigar
casting
occasional
glances
at
the
needle
as
it
oscillated
suddenly
as
williams
rose
in
the
wright
machine
the
needle
swung
quickly
and
pointed
straight
at
the
aviation
field
vibrating
through
a
small
area
back
and
forth
the
operator
is
getting
his
apparatus
ready
to
signal
to
williams
remarked
craig
this
is
an
apparatus
called
an
ondometer
it
tells
you
the
direction
and
something
of
the
magnitude
of
the
hertzian
waves
used
in
five
or
ten
minutes
passed
norton
was
getting
ready
to
fly
i
could
see
through
my
field
glass
that
he
was
putting
something
over
his
gyroscope
and
over
the
dynamo
but
could
not
quite
make
out
what
it
was
his
machine
seemed
to
leap
up
in
the
air
as
if
eager
to
redeem
itself
norton
with
his
head
was
the
hero
of
the
hour
no
sooner
had
his
aeroplane
got
up
over
the
level
of
the
trees
than
i
heard
a
quick
exclamation
from
craig
look
at
the
needle
walter
he
cried
as
soon
as
norton
got
into
the
air
it
shot
around
directly
opposite
to
the
wireless
station
and
now
it
is
pointing
we
raised
our
eyes
in
the
direction
which
it
indicated
it
was
precisely
in
line
with
the
barn
i
gasped
what
did
it
mean
did
it
mean
in
some
way
another
accident
to
norton
perhaps
fatal
this
time
why
had
kennedy
allowed
him
to
try
it
when
there
was
even
a
suspicion
that
some
nameless
terror
was
abroad
in
the
air
quickly
i
turned
to
see
if
norton
was
all
right
yes
there
he
was
circling
above
us
in
a
series
of
wide
spirals
climbing
up
up
now
he
seemed
almost
to
stop
to
hover
motionless
he
was
motionless
his
engine
had
been
cut
out
and
i
could
see
his
propeller
stopped
he
was
riding
as
a
ship
rides
on
the
ocean
a
boy
ran
up
the
ladder
to
the
roof
kennedy
unfolded
the
note
and
shoved
it
into
my
hands
it
was
from
the
operator
wireless
out
of
business
again
curse
that
fellow
who
is
butting
in
am
keeping
record
was
all
it
said
i
shot
a
glance
of
inquiry
at
kennedy
but
he
was
paying
no
attention
now
to
anything
but
norton
he
held
his
watch
in
his
hand
walter
he
ejaculated
as
he
snapped
it
shut
it
has
now
been
seven
minutes
and
a
half
since
he
stopped
his
propeller
the
brooks
prize
calls
for
five
minutes
only
norton
has
exceeded
it
fifty
per
cent
here
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
he
waved
three
times
and
stopped
then
he
repeated
the
process
at
the
third
time
the
aeroplane
seemed
to
give
a
start
the
propeller
began
to
revolve
norton
starting
it
on
the
compression
successfully
slowly
he
circled
down
again
toward
the
end
of
the
descent
he
stopped
the
engine
and
volplaned
or
coasted
to
the
ground
landing
gently
in
front
of
his
hangar
a
wild
cheer
rose
into
the
air
from
the
crowd
below
us
all
eyes
were
riveted
on
the
activity
about
norton
biplane
they
were
doing
something
to
it
whatever
it
was
it
was
finished
in
a
minute
and
the
men
were
standing
again
at
a
respectful
distance
from
the
propellers
again
norton
was
in
the
air
as
he
rose
above
the
field
kennedy
gave
a
last
glance
at
his
ondometer
and
sprang
down
the
ladder
i
followed
closely
back
of
the
crowd
he
hurried
down
the
walk
to
the
entrance
near
the
railroad
station
the
man
in
charge
of
the
pinkertons
was
at
the
gate
with
two
other
men
apparently
waiting
come
on
shouted
craig
we
four
followed
him
as
fast
as
we
could
he
turned
in
at
the
lane
running
up
to
the
yellow
house
so
as
to
approach
the
barn
from
the
rear
unobserved
quietly
now
he
cautioned
we
were
now
at
the
door
of
the
barn
a
curious
crackling
snapping
noise
issued
craig
gently
tried
the
door
it
was
bolted
on
the
inside
as
many
of
us
as
could
threw
ourselves
like
a
human
catapult
against
it
it
yielded
inside
i
saw
a
sheet
of
flame
fifteen
or
twenty
feet
long
it
was
a
veritable
artificial
bolt
of
lightning
a
man
with
a
telescope
had
been
peering
out
of
the
window
but
now
was
facing
us
in
surprise
lamar
shouted
kennedy
drawing
a
pistol
one
motion
of
your
hand
and
you
are
a
dead
man
stand
still
where
you
are
you
are
caught
the
rest
of
us
shrank
back
in
momentary
fear
of
the
gigantic
forces
of
nature
which
seemed
let
loose
in
the
room
the
thought
in
my
mind
at
least
was
suppose
this
should
turn
his
deadly
power
on
us
kennedy
saw
us
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
do
be
afraid
he
said
with
just
a
curl
to
his
lip
i
seen
all
this
before
it
wo
hurt
you
it
a
high
frequency
current
the
man
has
simply
appropriated
the
invention
of
nikola
tesla
seize
him
he
wo
struggle
i
got
him
two
burly
pinkertons
leaped
forward
gingerly
into
the
midst
of
the
electrical
apparatus
and
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
write
it
lamar
was
hustled
out
to
the
doorway
each
arm
pinioned
back
of
him
as
we
stood
half
dazed
by
the
suddenness
of
the
turn
of
events
kennedy
hastily
explained
tesla
theory
is
that
under
certain
conditions
the
atmosphere
which
is
normally
a
high
insulator
assumes
conducting
properties
and
so
becomes
capable
of
conveying
any
amount
of
electrical
energy
i
myself
have
seen
electrical
oscillations
such
as
these
in
this
room
of
such
intensity
that
while
they
could
be
circulated
with
impunity
through
one
arms
and
chest
they
would
melt
wires
farther
along
in
the
circuit
yet
the
person
through
whom
such
a
current
is
passing
feels
no
inconvenience
i
have
seen
a
loop
of
heavy
copper
wire
energised
by
such
oscillations
and
a
mass
of
metal
within
the
loop
heated
to
the
fusing
point
and
yet
into
the
space
in
which
this
destructive
aerial
turmoil
was
going
on
i
have
repeatedly
thrust
my
hand
and
even
my
head
without
feeling
anything
or
experiencing
any
injurious
in
this
form
all
the
energy
of
all
the
dynamos
of
niagara
could
pass
through
one
body
and
yet
produce
no
injury
but
diabolically
directed
this
vast
energy
has
been
used
by
this
man
to
melt
the
wires
in
the
little
dynamo
that
runs
norton
gyroscope
that
is
all
now
to
the
aviation
field
i
have
something
more
to
show
we
hurried
as
fast
as
we
could
up
the
street
and
straight
out
on
the
field
across
toward
the
norton
hangar
the
crowd
gaping
in
wonderment
kennedy
waved
frantically
for
norton
to
come
down
and
norton
who
was
only
a
few
hundred
feet
in
the
air
seemed
to
see
and
understand
as
we
stood
waiting
before
the
hangar
kennedy
could
no
longer
restrain
his
impatience
i
suspected
some
trick
when
i
found
that
the
field
wireless
telegraph
failed
to
work
every
time
norton
aeroplane
was
in
the
air
he
said
approaching
close
to
lamar
i
just
happened
to
catch
sight
of
that
peculiar
wireless
mast
of
yours
a
little
flash
of
light
first
attracted
my
attention
to
it
i
thought
it
was
an
electric
spark
but
you
are
too
clever
for
that
lamar
still
you
forgot
a
much
simpler
thing
it
was
the
glint
of
the
sun
on
the
lens
of
your
telescope
as
you
were
watching
norton
that
betrayed
lamar
said
nothing
i
glad
to
say
you
had
no
confederate
in
the
hangar
here
continued
craig
at
first
i
suspected
it
anyhow
you
succeeded
pretty
well
single
handed
two
lives
lost
and
two
machines
wrecked
norton
flew
all
right
yesterday
when
he
left
his
gyroscope
and
dynamo
behind
but
when
he
took
them
along
you
were
able
to
fuse
the
wires
in
the
dynamo
you
pretty
nearly
succeeded
in
adding
his
name
to
those
of
browne
and
the
whir
of
norton
machine
told
us
he
was
approaching
we
scattered
to
give
him
space
enough
to
choose
the
spot
where
he
would
alight
as
the
men
caught
his
machine
to
steady
it
he
jumped
lightly
to
the
ground
where
kennedy
he
asked
and
then
without
waiting
for
a
reply
he
exclaimed
queerest
thing
i
ever
saw
up
there
the
dynamo
protected
by
the
shield
in
this
flight
as
in
the
first
i
had
risen
a
hundred
feet
before
i
happened
to
hear
the
darndest
sputtering
in
the
dynamo
look
boys
the
insulation
is
completely
burned
off
the
wires
and
the
wires
are
nearly
all
fused
so
it
was
in
the
other
two
wrecked
machines
added
kennedy
coming
coolly
forward
if
you
had
had
everything
protected
by
those
shields
i
gave
you
in
your
first
flight
you
would
have
simply
repeated
your
fall
of
yesterday
perhaps
fatally
this
fellow
has
been
directing
the
full
strength
of
his
wireless
electricity
straight
at
you
all
the
what
fellow
demanded
norton
the
two
pinkertons
shoved
lamar
forward
norton
gave
a
contemptuous
look
at
him
delanne
he
said
i
knew
you
were
a
crook
when
you
tried
to
infringe
on
my
patent
but
i
did
think
you
were
coward
enough
to
resort
to
to
lamar
or
rather
delanne
shrank
back
as
if
even
the
protection
of
his
captors
was
safety
compared
to
the
threatening
advance
of
norton
toward
him
pouff
exclaimed
norton
turning
suddenly
on
his
heel
what
a
fool
i
am
the
law
will
take
care
of
such
scoundrels
as
you
what
the
grand
stand
cheering
for
now
he
asked
looking
across
the
field
in
an
effort
to
regain
his
a
boy
from
one
of
the
hangars
down
the
line
spoke
up
from
the
back
of
the
crowd
in
a
shrill
piping
voice
you
have
been
awarded
the
brooks
prize
sir
he
said
x
the
black
hand
kennedy
and
i
had
been
dining
rather
late
one
evening
at
luigi
a
little
italian
restaurant
on
the
lower
west
side
we
had
known
the
place
well
in
our
student
days
and
had
made
a
point
of
visiting
it
once
a
month
since
in
order
to
keep
in
practice
in
the
fine
art
of
gracefully
handling
long
shreds
of
spaghetti
therefore
we
did
not
think
it
strange
when
the
proprietor
himself
stopped
a
moment
at
our
table
to
greet
us
glancing
furtively
around
at
the
other
diners
mostly
italians
he
suddenly
leaned
over
and
whispered
to
kennedy
i
have
heard
of
your
wonderful
detective
work
professor
could
you
give
a
little
advice
in
the
case
of
a
friend
of
mine
surely
luigi
what
is
the
case
asked
craig
leaning
back
in
his
chair
luigi
glanced
around
again
apprehensively
and
lowered
his
voice
not
so
loud
sir
when
you
pay
your
check
go
out
walk
around
washington
square
and
come
in
at
the
private
entrance
i
be
waiting
in
the
hall
my
friend
is
dining
privately
we
lingered
a
while
over
our
chianti
then
quietly
paid
the
check
and
departed
true
to
his
word
luigi
was
waiting
for
us
in
the
dark
hall
with
a
motion
that
indicated
silence
he
led
us
up
the
stairs
to
the
second
floor
and
quickly
opened
a
door
into
what
seemed
to
be
a
private
a
man
was
pacing
the
floor
nervously
on
a
table
was
some
food
untouched
as
the
door
opened
i
thought
he
started
as
if
in
fear
and
i
am
sure
his
dark
face
blanched
if
only
for
an
instant
imagine
our
surprise
at
seeing
gennaro
the
great
tenor
with
whom
merely
to
have
a
speaking
acquaintance
was
to
argue
oneself
famous
oh
it
is
you
luigi
he
exclaimed
in
perfect
english
rich
and
mellow
and
who
are
these
gentlemen
luigi
merely
replied
friends
in
english
also
and
then
dropped
off
into
a
voluble
explanation
in
italian
i
could
see
as
we
waited
that
the
same
idea
had
flashed
over
mind
as
over
my
own
it
was
now
three
or
four
days
since
the
papers
had
reported
the
strange
kidnapping
of
gennaro
daughter
adelina
his
only
child
and
the
sending
of
a
demand
for
ten
thousand
dollars
ransom
signed
as
usual
with
the
mystic
black
hand
a
name
to
conjure
with
in
blackmail
and
extortion
as
signor
gennaro
advanced
toward
us
after
his
short
talk
with
luigi
almost
before
the
introductions
were
over
kennedy
anticipated
him
by
saying
i
understand
signor
before
you
ask
me
i
have
read
all
about
it
in
the
papers
you
want
someone
to
help
you
catch
the
criminals
who
are
holding
your
little
no
no
exclaimed
gennaro
excitedly
not
that
i
want
to
get
my
daughter
first
after
that
catch
them
if
you
can
yes
i
should
like
to
have
someone
do
it
but
read
this
first
and
tell
me
what
you
think
of
it
how
should
i
act
to
get
my
little
adelina
back
without
harming
a
hair
of
her
head
the
famous
singer
drew
from
a
capacious
pocketbook
a
dirty
crumpled
letter
scrawled
on
cheap
paper
kennedy
translated
it
quickly
it
read
honourable
sir
your
daughter
is
in
safe
hands
but
by
the
saints
if
you
give
this
letter
to
the
police
as
you
did
the
other
not
only
she
but
your
family
also
someone
near
to
you
will
suffer
we
will
not
fail
as
we
did
wednesday
if
you
want
your
daughter
back
go
yourself
alone
and
without
telling
a
soul
to
enrico
albano
saturday
night
at
the
twelfth
hour
you
must
provide
yourself
with
in
bills
hidden
in
saturday
il
progresso
italiano
in
the
back
room
you
will
see
a
man
sitting
alone
at
a
table
he
will
have
a
red
flower
on
his
coat
you
are
to
say
a
fine
opera
is
pagliacci
if
he
answers
not
without
gennaro
lay
the
newspaper
down
on
the
table
he
will
pick
it
up
leaving
his
own
the
bolletino
on
the
third
page
you
will
find
written
the
place
where
your
daughter
has
been
left
waiting
for
you
go
immediately
and
get
her
but
by
the
god
if
you
have
so
much
as
the
shadow
of
the
police
near
enrico
your
daughter
will
be
sent
to
you
in
a
box
that
night
do
not
fear
to
come
we
pledge
our
word
to
deal
fairly
if
you
deal
fairly
this
is
a
last
warning
lest
you
shall
forget
we
will
show
one
other
sign
of
our
power
la
mano
nera
the
end
of
this
ominous
letter
was
gruesomely
decorated
with
a
skull
and
a
rough
drawing
of
a
dagger
thrust
through
a
bleeding
heart
a
coffin
and
under
all
a
huge
black
hand
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
type
of
letter
that
it
was
it
was
such
as
have
of
late
years
become
increasingly
common
in
all
our
large
cities
baffling
the
best
detectives
you
have
not
showed
this
to
the
police
i
presume
asked
kennedy
naturally
are
you
going
saturday
night
i
am
afraid
to
go
and
afraid
to
stay
away
was
the
reply
and
the
voice
of
the
tenor
was
as
human
as
that
of
a
father
for
at
bottom
all
men
high
or
low
are
one
will
not
fail
as
we
did
wednesday
reread
craig
what
does
that
mean
gennaro
fumbled
in
his
pocketbook
again
and
at
last
drew
forth
a
typewritten
letter
bearing
the
of
the
leslie
laboratories
incorporated
after
i
received
the
first
threat
explained
gennaro
my
wife
and
i
went
from
our
apartments
at
the
hotel
to
her
father
the
banker
cesare
you
know
who
lives
on
fifth
avenue
i
gave
the
letter
to
the
italian
squad
of
the
police
the
next
morning
my
butler
noticed
something
peculiar
about
the
milk
he
barely
touched
some
of
it
to
his
tongue
and
he
has
been
violently
ill
ever
since
i
at
once
sent
the
milk
to
the
laboratory
of
my
friend
doctor
leslie
to
have
it
analysed
this
letter
shows
what
the
household
my
dear
gennaro
read
kennedy
the
milk
submitted
to
us
for
examination
on
the
inst
has
been
carefully
analysed
and
i
beg
to
hand
you
herewith

it

i
congratulate
you
and
yours
on
escaping
and
shall
of
course
respect
your
wishes
absolutely
regarding
keeping
secret
this
attempt
on
your
life
believe
me
very
sincerely
yours
c
as
kennedy
handed
the
letter
back
he
remarked
significantly
i
can
see
very
readily
why
you
do
care
to
have
the
police
figure
in
your
case
it
has
got
quite
beyond
ordinary
police
and
too
they
are
going
to
give
another
sign
of
their
power
groaned
gennaro
sinking
into
the
chair
before
his
untasted
food
you
say
you
have
left
your
hotel
inquired
kennedy
yes
my
wife
insisted
that
we
would
be
more
safely
guarded
at
the
residence
of
her
father
the
banker
but
we
are
afraid
even
there
since
the
poison
attempt
so
i
have
come
here
secretly
to
luigi
my
old
friend
luigi
who
is
preparing
food
for
us
and
in
a
few
minutes
one
of
cesare
automobiles
will
be
here
and
i
will
take
the
food
up
to
her
sparing
no
expense
or
trouble
she
is
it
will
kill
her
professor
kennedy
if
anything
happens
to
our
little
adelina
ah
sir
i
am
not
poor
myself
a
month
salary
at
the
that
is
what
they
ask
of
me
gladly
would
i
give
it
ten
thousand
dollars
all
if
they
asked
it
of
my
contract
with
herr
schleppencour
the
director
but
the
police
bah
they
are
all
for
catching
the
villains
what
good
will
it
do
me
if
they
catch
them
and
my
little
adelina
is
returned
to
me
dead
it
is
all
very
well
for
the
to
talk
of
justice
and
the
law
but
i
am
what
you
call
it
an
emotional
latin
i
want
my
little
daughter
and
at
any
cost
catch
the
villains
afterward
yes
i
will
pay
double
then
to
catch
them
so
that
they
can
not
blackmail
me
again
only
first
i
want
my
daughter
and
your
my
he
has
been
among
you
long
enough
to
be
one
of
you
he
has
fought
them
he
has
put
up
a
sign
in
his
money
paid
on
threats
but
i
say
it
is
foolish
i
do
not
know
america
as
well
as
he
but
i
know
this
the
police
never
succeed
the
ransom
is
paid
without
their
knowledge
and
they
very
often
take
the
credit
i
say
pay
first
then
i
will
swear
a
righteous
vendetta
i
will
bring
the
dogs
to
justice
with
the
money
yet
on
them
only
show
me
how
show
me
first
of
all
replied
kennedy
i
want
you
to
answer
one
question
truthfully
without
reservation
as
to
a
friend
i
am
your
friend
believe
me
is
there
any
person
a
relative
or
acquaintance
of
yourself
or
your
wife
or
your
whom
you
even
have
reason
to
suspect
of
being
capable
of
extorting
money
from
you
in
this
way
i
need
say
that
that
is
the
experience
of
the
district
attorney
office
in
the
large
majority
of
cases
of
this
black
no
replied
the
tenor
without
hesitation
i
know
that
and
i
have
thought
about
it
no
i
can
think
of
no
one
i
know
you
americans
often
speak
of
the
black
hand
as
a
myth
coined
originally
by
a
newspaper
writer
perhaps
it
has
no
organisation
but
professor
kennedy
to
me
it
is
no
myth
what
if
the
real
black
hand
is
any
gang
of
criminals
who
choose
to
use
that
convenient
name
to
extort
money
is
it
the
less
real
my
daughter
is
gone
exactly
agreed
kennedy
it
is
not
a
theory
that
confronts
you
it
is
a
hard
cold
fact
i
understand
that
perfectly
what
is
the
address
of
this
albano
luigi
mentioned
a
number
on
mulberry
street
and
kennedy
made
a
note
of
it
it
is
a
gambling
saloon
explained
luigi
albano
is
a
neapolitan
a
camorrista
one
of
my
countrymen
of
whom
i
am
thoroughly
ashamed
professor
do
you
think
this
albano
had
anything
to
do
with
the
letter
luigi
shrugged
his
shoulders
just
then
a
big
limousine
was
heard
outside
luigi
picked
up
a
huge
hamper
that
was
placed
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
followed
closely
by
signor
gennaro
hurried
down
to
it
as
the
tenor
left
us
he
grasped
our
hands
in
each
of
his
i
have
an
idea
in
my
mind
said
craig
simply
i
will
try
to
think
it
out
in
detail
where
can
i
find
you
come
to
me
at
the
in
the
afternoon
or
if
you
want
me
sooner
at
cesare
residence
good
night
and
a
thousand
thanks
to
you
professor
kennedy
and
to
you
also
jameson
i
trust
you
absolutely
because
luigi
trusts
we
sat
in
the
little
until
we
heard
the
door
of
the
limousine
bang
shut
and
the
car
shoot
off
with
the
rattle
of
the
changing
gears
one
more
question
luigi
said
craig
as
the
door
opened
again
i
have
never
been
on
that
block
in
mulberry
street
where
this
albano
is
do
you
happen
to
know
any
of
the
shopkeepers
on
it
or
near
it
i
have
a
cousin
who
has
a
on
the
corner
below
albano
on
the
same
side
of
the
good
do
you
think
he
would
let
me
use
his
store
for
a
few
minutes
saturday
night
of
course
without
any
risk
to
himself
i
think
i
could
arrange
very
well
then
say
at
nine
in
the
morning
i
will
stop
here
and
we
will
all
go
over
to
see
him
good
night
luigi
and
many
thanks
for
thinking
of
me
in
connection
with
this
case
i
enjoyed
signor
gennaro
singing
often
enough
at
the
opera
to
want
to
render
him
this
service
and
i
only
too
glad
to
be
able
to
be
of
service
to
all
honest
italians
that
is
if
i
succeed
in
carrying
out
a
plan
i
have
in
a
little
before
nine
the
following
day
kennedy
and
i
dropped
into
luigi
again
kennedy
was
carrying
a
which
he
had
taken
over
from
his
laboratory
to
our
rooms
the
night
before
luigi
was
waiting
for
us
and
without
losing
a
minute
we
sallied
forth
by
means
of
the
tortuous
twists
of
streets
in
old
greenwich
village
we
came
out
at
last
on
bleecker
street
and
began
walking
east
amid
the
of
races
of
lower
new
york
we
had
not
quite
reached
mulberry
street
when
our
attention
was
attracted
by
a
large
crowd
on
one
of
the
busy
corners
held
back
by
a
cordon
of
police
who
were
endeavouring
to
keep
the
people
moving
with
that
burly
good
nature
which
the
irish
policeman
displays
toward
the
of
southern
and
eastern
europe
who
throng
new
york
apparently
we
saw
as
we
edged
up
into
the
front
of
the
crowd
here
was
a
building
whose
whole
front
had
literally
been
torn
off
and
wrecked
the
thick
of
the
windows
was
smashed
to
a
mass
of
greenish
splinters
on
the
sidewalk
while
the
windows
of
the
upper
floors
and
for
several
houses
down
the
block
in
either
street
were
likewise
broken
some
thick
iron
bars
which
had
formerly
protected
the
windows
were
now
bent
and
twisted
a
huge
hole
yawned
in
the
floor
inside
the
doorway
and
peering
in
we
could
see
the
desks
and
chairs
a
tangled
mass
of
kindling
what
the
matter
i
inquired
of
an
officer
near
me
displaying
my
reporter
badge
more
for
its
moral
effect
than
in
the
hope
of
getting
any
real
information
in
these
days
of
enforced
silence
toward
the
press
black
hand
bomb
was
the
laconic
reply
whew
i
whistled
anyone
hurt
they
do
usually
kill
anyone
do
they
asked
the
officer
by
way
of
reply
to
test
my
acquaintance
with
such
things
no
i
admitted
they
destroy
more
property
than
lives
but
did
they
get
anyone
this
time
this
must
have
been
a
thoroughly
overloaded
bomb
i
should
judge
by
the
looks
of
came
pretty
close
to
it
the
bank
had
any
more
than
opened
when
bang
went
this
thing
crowd
collected
before
the
smoke
had
fairly
cleared
man
who
owns
the
bank
was
hurt
but
not
badly
now
come
beat
it
down
to
headquarters
if
you
want
to
find
out
any
you
find
it
printed
on
the
pink
slips
the
book
by
this
time
the
rules
for
me
to
talk
he
added
with
a
grin
then
to
the
crowd
now
you
traffic
keep
i
turned
to
craig
and
luigi
their
eyes
were
riveted
on
the
big
gilt
sign
half
broken
and
all
askew
overhead
it
read
ciro
di
cesare
bankers
new
york
genoa
naples
rome
palermo
this
is
the
reminder
so
that
gennaro
and
his
will
not
forget
i
gasped
yes
added
craig
pulling
us
away
and
cesare
himself
is
wounded
too
perhaps
that
was
for
putting
up
the
notice
refusing
to
pay
perhaps
not
it
a
queer
case
they
usually
set
the
bombs
off
at
night
when
no
one
is
around
there
must
be
more
back
of
this
than
merely
to
scare
gennaro
it
looks
to
me
as
if
they
were
after
casare
too
first
by
poison
then
by
we
shouldered
our
way
out
through
the
crowd
and
went
on
until
we
came
to
mulberry
street
pulsing
with
life
down
we
went
past
the
little
shops
dodging
the
children
and
making
way
for
women
with
huge
bundles
of
sweatshop
clothing
accurately
balanced
on
their
heads
or
hugged
up
under
their
capacious
capes
here
was
just
one
little
colony
of
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
italians
a
population
larger
than
the
italian
population
of
rome
of
whose
life
the
rest
of
new
york
knew
and
cared
nothing
at
last
we
came
to
albano
little
a
dark
evil
malodorous
place
on
the
street
level
of
a
alleged
tenement
without
hesitation
kennedy
entered
and
we
followed
acting
the
part
of
a
slumming
party
there
were
a
few
customers
at
this
early
hour
men
out
of
employment
and
an
lot
though
of
course
they
eyed
us
sharply
albano
himself
proved
to
be
a
greasy
fellow
who
had
a
sort
of
cunning
look
i
could
well
imagine
such
a
fellow
spreading
terror
in
the
hearts
of
simple
folk
by
merely
pressing
both
temples
with
his
thumbs
and
drawing
his
long
bony
under
his
throat
the
black
hand
sign
that
has
shut
up
many
a
witness
in
the
middle
of
his
testimony
even
in
open
court
we
pushed
through
to
the
back
room
which
was
empty
and
sat
down
at
a
table
over
a
bottle
of
albano
famous
california
red
ink
we
sat
silently
kennedy
was
making
a
mental
note
of
the
place
in
the
middle
of
the
ceiling
was
a
single
with
a
big
reflector
over
it
in
the
back
wall
of
the
room
was
a
horizontal
oblong
window
barred
and
with
a
sash
that
opened
like
a
transom
the
tables
were
dirty
and
the
chairs
rickety
the
walls
were
bare
and
unfinished
with
beams
innocent
of
decoration
altogether
it
was
as
unprepossessing
a
place
as
i
had
ever
seen
apparently
satisfied
with
his
scrutiny
kennedy
got
up
to
go
complimenting
the
proprietor
on
his
wine
i
could
see
that
kennedy
had
made
up
his
mind
as
to
his
course
of
action
how
sordid
crime
really
is
he
remarked
as
we
walked
on
down
the
street
look
at
that
place
of
albano
i
defy
even
the
police
news
reporter
on
the
star
to
find
any
glamour
in
our
next
stop
was
at
the
corner
at
the
little
store
kept
by
the
cousin
of
luigi
who
conducted
us
back
of
the
partition
where
prescriptions
were
compounded
and
found
us
chairs
a
hurried
explanation
from
luigi
brought
a
cloud
to
the
open
face
of
the
druggist
as
if
he
hesitated
to
lay
himself
and
his
little
fortune
open
to
the
blackmailers
kennedy
saw
it
and
interrupted
all
that
i
wish
to
do
he
said
is
to
put
in
a
little
instrument
here
and
use
it
for
a
few
minutes
indeed
there
will
be
no
risk
to
you
vincenzo
secrecy
is
what
i
desire
and
no
one
will
ever
know
about
vincenzo
was
at
length
convinced
and
craig
opened
his
there
was
little
in
it
except
several
coils
of
insulated
wire
some
tools
a
couple
of
packages
wrapped
up
and
a
couple
of
pairs
of
overalls
in
a
moment
kennedy
had
donned
overalls
and
was
smearing
dirt
and
grease
over
his
face
and
hands
under
his
direction
i
did
the
same
taking
the
bag
of
tools
the
wire
and
one
of
the
small
packages
we
went
out
on
the
street
and
then
up
through
the
dark
and
hall
of
the
tenement
up
a
woman
stopped
us
suspiciously
telephone
company
said
craig
curtly
here
permission
from
the
owner
of
the
house
to
string
wires
across
the
he
pulled
an
old
letter
out
of
his
pocket
but
as
it
was
too
dark
to
read
even
if
the
woman
had
cared
to
do
so
we
went
on
up
as
he
had
expected
unmolested
at
last
we
came
to
the
roof
where
there
were
some
children
at
play
a
couple
of
houses
down
from
us
kennedy
began
by
dropping
two
strands
of
wire
down
to
the
ground
in
the
back
yard
behind
vincenzo
shop
then
he
proceeded
to
lay
two
wires
along
the
edge
of
the
roof
we
had
worked
only
a
little
while
when
the
children
began
to
collect
however
kennedy
kept
right
on
until
we
reached
the
tenement
next
to
that
in
which
albano
shop
was
walter
he
whispered
just
get
the
children
away
for
a
minute
look
here
you
kids
i
yelled
some
of
you
will
fall
off
if
you
get
so
close
to
the
edge
of
the
roof
keep
it
had
no
effect
apparently
they
looked
not
a
bit
frightened
at
the
dizzy
mass
of
below
us
say
is
there
a
on
this
block
i
asked
in
desperation
yes
sir
came
the
chorus
who
go
down
and
get
me
a
bottle
of
ginger
ale
i
asked
a
chorus
of
voices
and
glittering
eyes
was
the
answer
they
all
would
i
took
a
from
my
pocket
and
gave
it
to
the
oldest
all
right
now
hustle
along
and
divide
the
with
the
scamper
of
many
feet
they
were
gone
and
we
were
alone
kennedy
had
now
reached
albano
and
as
soon
as
the
last
head
had
disappeared
below
the
scuttle
of
the
roof
he
dropped
two
long
strands
down
into
the
back
yard
as
he
had
done
at
vincenzo
i
started
to
go
back
but
he
stopped
me
oh
that
will
never
do
he
said
the
kids
will
see
that
the
wires
end
here
i
must
carry
them
on
several
houses
farther
as
a
blind
and
trust
to
luck
that
they
do
see
the
wires
leading
down
we
were
several
houses
down
still
putting
up
wires
when
the
crowd
came
shouting
back
sticky
with
cheap
candy
and
black
with
east
side
chocolate
we
opened
the
ginger
ale
and
forced
ourselves
to
drink
it
so
as
to
excite
no
suspicion
then
a
few
minutes
later
descended
the
stairs
of
the
tenement
coming
out
just
above
albano
i
was
wondering
how
kennedy
was
going
to
get
into
albano
again
without
exciting
suspicion
he
solved
it
neatly
now
walter
do
you
think
you
could
stand
another
dip
into
that
red
ink
of
albano
i
said
i
might
in
the
interests
of
science
and
justice
not
otherwise
well
your
face
is
sufficiently
dirty
he
commented
so
that
with
the
overalls
you
do
look
very
much
as
you
did
the
first
time
you
went
in
i
do
think
they
will
recognise
you
do
i
look
pretty
good
you
look
like
a
out
of
a
job
i
said
i
can
scarcely
restrain
my
all
right
then
take
this
little
glass
bottle
go
into
the
back
room
and
order
something
cheap
in
keeping
with
your
looks
then
when
you
are
all
alone
break
the
bottle
it
is
full
of
gas
drippings
your
nose
will
dictate
what
to
do
next
just
tell
the
proprietor
you
saw
the
gas
company
wagon
on
the
next
block
and
come
up
here
and
tell
i
entered
there
was
a
man
with
a
sort
of
unscrupulous
intelligence
writing
at
a
table
as
he
wrote
and
puffed
at
his
cigar
i
noticed
a
scar
on
his
face
a
deep
furrow
running
from
the
lobe
of
his
ear
to
his
mouth
that
i
knew
was
a
brand
set
upon
him
by
the
camorra
i
sat
and
smoked
and
sipped
slowly
for
several
minutes
cursing
him
inwardly
more
for
his
presence
than
for
his
evident
look
of
the
mala
at
last
he
went
out
to
ask
the
barkeeper
for
a
stamp
quickly
i
tiptoed
over
to
another
corner
of
the
room
and
ground
the
little
bottle
under
my
heel
then
i
resumed
my
seat
the
odour
that
pervaded
the
room
was
sickening
the
man
with
the
scar
came
in
again
and
sniffed
i
sniffed
then
the
proprietor
came
in
and
sniffed
say
i
said
in
the
toughest
voice
i
could
assume
you
got
a
leak
wait
i
seen
the
gas
company
wagon
on
the
next
block
when
i
came
in
i
get
the
i
dashed
out
and
hurried
up
the
street
to
the
place
where
kennedy
was
waiting
impatiently
rattling
his
tools
he
followed
me
with
apparent
reluctance
as
he
entered
the
he
snorted
after
the
manner
of
where
de
leak
you
da
leak
grunted
albano
you
you
pay
for
you
me
do
your
work
well
half
a
dozen
o
you
wops
get
out
o
here
that
all
all
wanter
be
blown
ter
pieces
wid
dem
pipes
and
cigarettes
clear
out
growled
kennedy
they
retreated
precipitately
and
craig
hastily
opened
his
bag
of
tools
quick
walter
shut
the
door
and
hold
it
exclaimed
craig
working
rapidly
he
unwrapped
a
little
package
and
took
out
a
round
flat
thing
of
black
vulcanised
rubber
jumping
up
on
a
table
he
fixed
it
to
the
top
of
the
reflector
over
the
can
you
see
that
from
the
floor
walter
he
asked
under
his
breath
no
i
replied
not
even
when
i
know
it
is
then
he
attached
a
couple
of
wires
to
it
and
led
them
across
the
ceiling
toward
the
window
concealing
them
carefully
by
sticking
them
in
the
shadow
of
a
beam
at
the
window
he
quickly
attached
the
wires
to
the
two
that
were
dangling
down
from
the
roof
and
shoved
them
around
out
of
sight
we
have
to
trust
that
no
one
sees
them
he
said
that
the
best
i
can
do
at
such
short
notice
i
never
saw
a
room
so
bare
as
this
anyway
there
is
another
place
i
could
put
that
thing
without
its
being
we
gathered
up
the
broken
glass
of
the
gas
drippings
bottle
and
i
opened
the
door
it
all
right
now
said
craig
sauntering
out
before
the
bar
only
de
next
time
you
has
de
matter
call
de
company
up
i
supposed
to
do
dis
orders
see
a
moment
later
i
followed
glad
to
get
out
of
the
oppressive
atmosphere
and
joined
him
in
the
back
of
vincenzo
where
he
was
again
at
work
as
there
was
no
back
window
there
it
was
quite
a
job
to
lead
the
wires
around
the
outside
from
the
back
yard
and
in
at
a
side
window
it
was
at
last
done
however
without
exciting
suspicion
and
kennedy
attached
them
to
an
oblong
box
of
weathered
oak
and
a
pair
of
specially
constructed
dry
batteries
now
said
craig
as
we
washed
off
the
stains
of
work
and
stowed
the
overalls
back
in
the
suitcase
that
is
done
to
my
satisfaction
i
can
tell
gennaro
to
go
ahead
safely
now
and
meet
the
from
vincenzo
we
walked
over
toward
centre
street
where
kennedy
and
i
left
luigi
to
return
to
his
restaurant
with
instructions
to
be
at
vincenzo
at
eleven
that
night
we
turned
into
the
new
police
headquarters
and
went
down
the
long
corridor
to
the
italian
bureau
kennedy
sent
in
his
card
to
lieutenant
giuseppe
in
charge
and
we
were
quickly
admitted
the
lieutenant
was
a
short
fullfaced
fleshy
italian
with
lightish
hair
and
eyes
that
were
apparently
dull
until
you
suddenly
discovered
that
that
was
merely
a
cover
to
their
really
restless
way
of
taking
in
everything
and
fixing
the
impressions
on
his
mind
as
if
on
a
sensitive
plate
i
want
to
talk
about
the
gennaro
case
began
craig
i
may
add
that
i
have
been
rather
closely
associated
with
inspector
of
the
central
office
on
a
number
of
cases
so
that
i
think
we
can
trust
each
other
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
you
know
about
it
if
i
promise
you
that
i
too
have
something
to
reveal
the
lieutenant
leaned
back
and
watched
kennedy
closely
without
seeming
to
do
so
when
i
was
in
italy
last
year
he
replied
at
length
i
did
a
good
deal
of
work
in
tracing
up
some
camorra
suspects
i
had
a
tip
about
some
of
them
to
look
up
their
records
i
need
say
where
it
came
from
but
it
was
a
good
one
much
of
the
evidence
against
some
of
those
fellows
who
are
being
tried
at
viterbo
was
gathered
by
the
carabinieri
as
a
result
of
hints
that
i
was
able
to
give
them
clues
that
were
furnished
to
me
here
in
america
from
the
source
i
speak
of
i
suppose
there
is
really
no
need
to
conceal
it
though
the
original
tip
came
from
a
certain
banker
here
in
new
i
can
guess
who
it
was
nodded
craig
then
as
you
know
this
banker
is
a
fighter
he
is
the
man
who
organised
the
white
hand
an
organisation
which
is
trying
to
rid
the
italian
population
of
the
black
hand
his
society
had
a
lot
of
evidence
regarding
former
members
of
both
the
camorra
in
naples
and
the
mafia
in
sicily
as
well
as
the
black
hand
gangs
in
new
york
chicago
and
other
cities
well
cesare
as
you
know
is
gennaro
while
i
was
in
naples
looking
up
the
record
of
a
certain
criminal
i
heard
of
a
peculiar
murder
committed
some
years
ago
there
was
an
honest
old
music
master
who
apparently
lived
the
quietest
and
most
harmless
of
lives
but
it
became
known
that
he
was
supported
by
cesare
and
had
received
handsome
presents
of
money
from
him
the
old
man
was
as
you
may
have
guessed
the
first
music
teacher
of
gennaro
the
man
who
discovered
him
one
might
have
been
at
a
loss
to
see
how
he
could
have
an
enemy
but
there
was
one
who
coveted
his
small
fortune
one
day
he
was
stabbed
and
robbed
his
murderer
ran
out
into
the
street
crying
out
that
the
poor
man
had
been
killed
naturally
a
crowd
rushed
up
in
a
moment
for
it
was
in
the
middle
of
the
day
before
the
injured
man
could
make
it
understood
who
had
struck
him
the
assassin
was
down
the
street
and
lost
in
the
maze
of
old
naples
where
he
well
knew
the
houses
of
his
friends
who
would
hide
him
the
man
who
is
known
to
have
committed
that
crime
francesco
paoli
escaped
to
new
york
we
are
looking
for
him
he
is
a
clever
man
far
above
the
average
son
of
a
doctor
in
a
town
a
few
miles
from
naples
went
to
the
university
was
expelled
for
some
mad
prank
in
short
he
was
the
black
sheep
of
the
family
of
course
over
here
he
is
too
to
work
with
his
hands
on
a
railroad
or
in
a
trench
and
not
educated
enough
to
work
at
anything
else
so
he
has
been
preying
on
his
more
industrious
countrymen
a
typical
case
of
a
man
living
by
his
wits
with
no
visible
means
of
support
now
i
do
mind
telling
you
in
strict
confidence
continued
the
lieutenant
that
it
my
theory
that
old
cesare
has
seen
paoli
here
knew
he
was
wanted
for
that
murder
of
the
old
music
master
and
gave
me
the
tip
to
look
up
his
record
at
any
rate
paoli
disappeared
right
after
i
returned
from
italy
and
we
have
been
able
to
locate
him
since
he
must
have
found
out
in
some
way
that
the
tip
to
look
him
up
had
been
given
by
the
white
hand
he
had
been
a
camorrista
in
italy
and
had
many
ways
of
getting
information
here
in
he
paused
and
balanced
a
piece
of
cardboard
in
his
hand
it
is
my
theory
of
this
case
that
if
we
could
locate
this
paoli
we
could
solve
the
kidnapping
of
little
adelina
gennaro
very
quickly
that
his
kennedy
and
i
bent
over
to
look
at
it
and
i
started
in
surprise
it
was
my
friend
with
the
scar
on
his
cheek
well
said
craig
quietly
handing
back
the
card
whether
or
not
he
is
the
man
i
know
where
we
can
catch
the
kidnappers
it
was
giuseppe
turn
to
show
surprise
now
with
your
assistance
i
get
this
man
and
the
whole
gang
explained
craig
rapidly
sketching
over
his
plan
and
concealing
just
enough
to
make
sure
that
no
matter
how
anxious
the
lieutenant
was
to
get
the
credit
he
could
not
spoil
the
affair
by
premature
interference
the
final
arrangement
was
that
four
of
the
best
men
of
the
squad
were
to
hide
in
a
vacant
store
across
from
vincenzo
early
in
the
evening
long
before
anyone
was
watching
the
signal
for
them
to
appear
was
to
be
the
extinguishing
of
the
lights
behind
the
coloured
bottles
in
the
druggist
window
a
taxicab
was
to
be
kept
waiting
at
headquarters
at
the
same
time
with
three
other
good
men
ready
to
start
for
a
given
address
the
moment
the
alarm
was
given
over
the
telephone
we
found
gennaro
awaiting
us
with
the
greatest
anxiety
at
the
the
bomb
at
cesare
had
been
the
last
straw
gennaro
had
already
drawn
from
his
bank
ten
crisp
bills
and
already
had
a
copy
of
il
progresso
in
which
he
had
hidden
the
money
between
the
sheets
mr
kennedy
he
said
i
am
going
to
meet
them
they
may
kill
me
see
i
have
provided
myself
with
a
pistol
i
shall
fight
too
if
necessary
for
my
little
adelina
but
if
it
is
only
money
they
want
they
shall
have
one
thing
i
want
to
say
began
kennedy
no
no
no
cried
the
tenor
i
will
go
you
shall
not
stop
i
do
wish
to
stop
you
craig
reassured
him
but
one
thing
do
exactly
as
i
tell
you
and
i
swear
not
a
hair
of
the
child
head
will
be
injured
and
we
will
get
the
blackmailers
how
eagerly
asked
gennaro
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
all
i
want
you
to
do
is
to
go
to
albano
at
the
appointed
time
sit
down
in
the
back
room
get
into
conversation
with
them
and
above
all
signor
as
soon
as
you
get
the
copy
of
the
bolletino
turn
to
the
third
page
pretend
not
to
be
able
to
read
the
address
ask
the
man
to
read
it
then
repeat
it
after
him
pretend
to
be
overjoyed
offer
to
set
up
wine
for
the
whole
crowd
just
a
few
minutes
that
is
all
i
ask
and
i
will
guarantee
that
you
will
be
the
happiest
man
in
new
york
gennaro
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
he
grasped
kennedy
hand
that
is
better
than
having
the
whole
police
force
back
of
me
he
said
i
shall
never
forget
never
as
we
went
out
kennedy
remarked
you
ca
blame
them
for
keeping
their
troubles
to
themselves
here
we
send
a
police
officer
over
to
italy
to
look
up
the
records
of
some
of
the
worst
suspects
he
loses
his
life
another
takes
his
place
then
after
he
gets
back
he
is
set
to
work
on
the
mere
clerical
routine
of
translating
them
one
of
his
associates
is
reduced
in
rank
and
so
what
does
it
come
to
hundreds
of
records
have
become
useless
because
the
three
years
within
which
the
criminals
could
be
deported
have
elapsed
with
nothing
done
intelligent
is
it
i
believe
it
has
been
established
that
all
but
about
fifty
of
seven
hundred
known
italian
suspects
are
still
at
large
mostly
in
this
city
and
the
rest
of
the
italian
population
is
guarded
from
them
by
a
squad
of
police
in
number
scarcely
of
the
number
of
known
criminals
no
it
our
fault
if
the
black
hand
we
had
been
standing
on
the
corner
of
broadway
waiting
for
a
car
now
walter
do
forget
meet
me
at
the
bleecker
street
station
of
the
subway
at
i
off
to
the
university
i
have
some
very
important
experiments
with
phosphorescent
salts
that
i
want
to
finish
what
has
that
to
do
with
the
case
i
asked
mystified
nothing
replied
craig
i
did
say
it
had
at
forget
by
george
though
that
paoli
must
be
a
clever
one
think
of
his
knowing
about
ricin
i
only
heard
of
it
myself
recently
well
here
my
car
craig
swung
aboard
an
amsterdam
avenue
car
leaving
me
to
kill
eight
nervous
hours
of
my
weekly
day
of
rest
from
the
star
they
passed
at
length
and
at
precisely
the
appointed
time
kennedy
and
i
met
with
suppressed
excitement
at
least
on
my
part
we
walked
over
to
vincenzo
at
night
this
section
of
the
city
was
indeed
a
black
enigma
the
lights
in
the
shops
where
olive
oil
fruit
and
other
things
were
sold
were
winking
out
one
by
one
here
and
there
strains
of
music
floated
out
of
and
little
groups
lingered
on
corners
conversing
in
animated
sentences
we
passed
albano
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
being
careful
not
to
look
at
it
too
closely
for
several
men
were
hanging
idly
about
pickets
apparently
with
some
secret
code
that
would
instantly
have
spread
far
and
wide
the
news
of
any
alarming
action
at
the
corner
we
crossed
and
looked
in
vincenzo
window
a
moment
casting
a
furtive
glance
across
the
street
at
the
dark
empty
store
where
the
police
must
be
hiding
then
we
went
in
and
casually
sauntered
back
of
the
partition
luigi
was
there
already
there
were
several
customers
still
in
the
store
however
and
therefore
we
had
to
sit
in
silence
while
vincenzo
quickly
finished
a
prescription
and
waited
on
the
last
one
at
last
the
doors
were
locked
and
the
lights
lowered
all
except
those
in
the
windows
which
were
to
serve
as
signals
ten
minutes
to
twelve
said
kennedy
placing
the
oblong
box
on
the
table
gennaro
will
be
going
in
soon
let
us
try
this
machine
now
and
see
if
it
works
if
the
wires
have
been
cut
since
we
put
them
up
this
morning
gennaro
will
have
to
take
his
chances
kennedy
reached
over
and
with
a
light
movement
of
his
forefinger
touched
a
switch
instantly
a
babel
of
voices
filled
the
store
all
talking
at
once
rapidly
and
loudly
here
and
there
we
could
distinguish
a
snatch
of
conversation
a
word
a
phrase
now
and
then
even
a
whole
sentence
above
the
rest
there
was
the
clink
of
glasses
i
could
hear
the
rattle
of
dice
on
a
bare
table
and
an
oath
a
cork
popped
somebody
scratched
a
match
we
sat
bewildered
looking
at
kennedy
for
an
explanation
imagine
that
you
are
sitting
at
a
table
in
albano
back
room
was
all
he
said
this
is
what
you
would
be
hearing
this
is
my
ear
in
other
words
the
dictograph
used
i
am
told
by
the
secret
service
of
the
united
states
wait
in
a
moment
you
will
hear
gennaro
come
in
luigi
and
vincenzo
translate
what
you
hear
my
knowledge
of
italian
is
pretty
can
they
hear
us
whispered
luigi
in
an
whisper
craig
laughed
no
not
yet
but
i
have
only
to
touch
this
other
switch
and
i
could
produce
an
effect
in
that
room
that
would
rival
the
famous
writing
on
belshazzar
wall
only
it
would
be
a
voice
from
the
wall
instead
of
they
seem
to
be
waiting
for
someone
said
vincenzo
i
heard
somebody
say
will
be
here
in
a
few
minutes
now
get
out
the
babel
of
voices
seemed
to
calm
down
as
men
withdrew
from
the
room
only
one
or
two
were
left
one
of
them
says
the
child
is
all
right
she
has
been
left
in
the
back
yard
translated
luigi
what
yard
did
he
say
asked
kennedy
no
they
just
speak
of
it
as
the
replied
luigi
jameson
go
outside
in
the
store
to
the
telephone
booth
and
call
up
headquarters
ask
them
if
the
automobile
is
ready
with
the
men
in
i
rang
up
and
after
a
moment
the
police
central
answered
that
everything
was
right
then
tell
central
to
hold
the
line
clear
we
must
lose
a
moment
jameson
you
stay
in
the
booth
vincenzo
you
pretend
to
be
working
around
your
window
but
not
in
such
a
way
as
to
attract
attention
for
they
have
men
watching
the
street
very
carefully
what
is
it
luigi
gennaro
is
coming
i
just
heard
one
of
them
say
he
comes
even
from
the
booth
i
could
hear
the
dictograph
repeating
the
conversation
in
the
dingy
little
back
room
of
albano
down
the
street
he
ordering
a
bottle
of
red
wine
murmured
luigi
dancing
up
and
down
with
excitement
vincenzo
was
so
nervous
that
he
knocked
a
bottle
down
in
the
window
and
i
believe
that
my
heartbeats
were
almost
audible
over
the
telephone
which
i
was
holding
for
the
police
operator
called
me
down
for
asking
so
many
times
if
all
was
ready
there
it
is
the
signal
cried
craig
fine
opera
is
i
now
listen
for
the
a
moment
elapsed
then
not
without
gennaro
came
a
gruff
voice
in
italian
from
the
dictograph
a
silence
ensued
it
was
tense
wait
wait
said
a
voice
which
i
recognised
instantly
as
gennaro
i
can
not
read
this
what
is
this
prince
street
no
she
has
been
left
in
the
backyard
answered
the
voice
jameson
called
craig
tell
them
to
drive
straight
to
prince
street
they
will
find
the
girl
in
the
back
yard
quick
before
the
have
a
chance
to
go
back
on
their
i
fairly
shouted
my
orders
to
the
police
headquarters
they
off
came
back
the
answer
and
i
hung
up
the
receiver
what
was
that
craig
was
asking
of
luigi
i
did
catch
it
what
did
they
say
that
other
voice
said
to
gennaro
down
while
i
count
this
sh
he
talking
if
it
is
a
penny
less
than
ten
thousand
or
i
find
a
mark
on
the
bills
i
call
to
enrico
and
your
daughter
will
be
spirited
away
again
translated
luigi
now
gennaro
is
talking
said
craig
good
he
is
gaining
time
he
is
a
trump
i
can
distinguish
that
all
right
he
asking
the
gruff
voiced
fellow
if
he
will
have
another
bottle
of
wine
he
says
he
will
good
they
must
be
at
prince
street
now
we
give
them
a
few
minutes
more
not
too
much
for
word
will
be
back
to
albano
like
wildfire
and
they
will
get
gennaro
after
all
ah
they
are
drinking
again
what
was
that
luigi
the
money
is
all
right
he
says
now
vincenzo
out
with
the
lights
a
door
banged
open
across
the
street
and
four
huge
dark
figures
darted
out
in
the
direction
of
albano
with
his
finger
kennedy
pulled
down
the
other
switch
and
shouted
gennaro
this
is
kennedy
to
the
street
polizia
polizia
a
scuffle
and
a
cry
of
surprise
followed
a
second
voice
apparently
from
the
bar
shouted
out
with
the
lights
out
with
the
lights
bang
went
a
pistol
and
another
the
dictograph
which
had
been
all
sound
a
moment
before
was
as
mute
as
a
what
the
matter
i
asked
kennedy
as
he
rushed
past
me
they
have
shot
out
the
lights
my
receiving
instrument
is
destroyed
come
on
jameson
vincenzo
stay
back
if
you
do
want
to
appear
in
a
short
figure
rushed
by
me
faster
even
than
i
could
go
it
was
the
faithful
luigi
in
front
of
albano
an
exciting
fight
was
going
on
shots
were
being
fired
wildly
in
the
darkness
and
heads
were
popping
out
of
tenement
windows
on
all
sides
as
kennedy
and
i
flung
ourselves
into
the
crowd
we
caught
a
glimpse
of
gennaro
with
blood
streaming
from
a
cut
on
his
shoulder
struggling
with
a
policeman
while
luigi
vainly
was
trying
to
interpose
himself
between
them
a
man
held
by
another
policeman
was
urging
the
first
officer
on
that
the
man
he
was
crying
the
kidnapper
i
caught
in
a
moment
kennedy
was
behind
him
paoli
you
lie
you
are
the
kidnapper
seize
him
he
has
the
money
on
him
that
other
is
gennaro
the
policeman
released
the
tenor
and
both
of
them
seized
paoli
the
others
were
beating
at
the
door
which
was
being
frantically
barricaded
inside
just
then
a
taxicab
came
swinging
up
they
street
three
men
jumped
out
and
added
their
strength
to
those
who
were
battering
down
barricade
gennaro
with
a
cry
leaped
into
the
taxicab
over
his
shoulder
i
could
see
a
tangled
mass
of
dark
brown
curls
and
a
childish
voice
lisped
why
did
you
come
for
me
papa
the
bad
man
told
me
if
i
waited
in
the
yard
you
would
come
for
me
but
if
i
cried
he
said
he
would
shoot
me
and
i
waited
and
waited
there
there
una
papa
going
to
take
you
straight
home
to
a
crash
followed
as
the
door
yielded
and
the
famous
paoli
gang
was
in
the
hands
of
the
law
xi
the
artificial
paradise
it
was
i
recall
at
that
period
of
the
late
unpleasantness
in
the
little
central
american
republic
of
vespuccia
when
things
looked
darkest
for
american
investors
that
i
hurried
home
one
evening
to
kennedy
bursting
with
news
by
way
of
explanation
i
may
add
that
during
the
rubber
boom
kennedy
had
invested
in
stock
of
a
rubber
company
in
vespuccia
and
that
its
value
had
been
shrinking
for
some
time
with
that
elasticity
which
a
rubber
band
shows
when
one
party
suddenly
lets
go
his
end
kennedy
had
been
in
danger
of
being
snapped
rather
hard
by
the
recoil
and
i
knew
he
had
put
in
an
order
with
his
broker
to
sell
and
take
his
loss
when
a
certain
figure
was
reached
my
news
was
a
first
ray
of
light
in
an
otherwise
dark
situation
and
i
wanted
to
advise
him
to
cancel
the
selling
order
and
stick
for
a
rise
accordingly
i
hurried
unceremoniously
into
our
apartment
with
the
words
on
my
lips
before
i
had
fairly
closed
the
door
what
do
you
think
craig
i
shouted
it
is
rumoured
that
the
revolutionists
have
captured
half
a
million
dollars
from
the
government
and
are
sending
it
to
i
stopped
short
i
had
no
idea
that
kennedy
had
a
client
and
a
girl
too
with
a
hastily
mumbled
apology
i
checked
myself
and
backed
out
toward
my
own
room
i
may
as
well
confess
that
i
did
not
retreat
very
fast
however
kennedy
client
was
not
only
a
girl
but
a
very
pretty
one
i
found
as
she
turned
her
head
quickly
at
my
sudden
entrance
and
betray
a
lively
interest
at
the
mention
of
the
revolution
she
was
a
and
the
type
of
feminine
beauty
is
fascinating
at
least
to
me
i
did
not
retreat
very
fast
as
i
hoped
kennedy
rose
to
the
occasion
miss
guerrero
he
said
let
me
introduce
jameson
who
has
helped
me
very
much
in
solving
some
of
my
most
difficult
cases
miss
guerrero
father
walter
is
the
owner
of
a
plantation
which
sells
its
product
to
the
company
i
am
interested
she
bowed
graciously
but
there
was
a
moment
of
embarrassment
until
kennedy
came
to
the
rescue
i
shall
need
jameson
in
handling
your
case
miss
guerrero
he
explained
would
it
be
presuming
to
ask
you
to
repeat
to
him
briefly
what
you
have
already
told
me
about
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
your
father
perhaps
some
additional
details
will
occur
to
you
things
that
you
may
consider
trivial
but
which
i
assure
you
may
be
of
the
utmost
she
assented
and
in
a
low
tremulous
musical
voice
bravely
went
through
her
story
we
come
she
began
my
father
and
i
for
my
mother
died
when
i
was
a
little
girl
we
come
from
the
northern
part
of
vespuccia
where
foreign
capitalists
are
much
interested
in
the
introduction
of
a
new
rubber
plant
i
am
an
only
child
and
have
been
the
constant
companion
of
my
father
for
years
ever
since
i
could
ride
a
pony
going
with
him
about
our
hacienda
and
on
business
trips
to
europe
and
the
states
i
may
as
well
say
at
the
start
jameson
that
although
my
father
is
a
large
he
has
very
liberal
political
views
and
is
deeply
in
sympathy
with
the
revolution
that
is
now
going
on
in
vespuccia
in
fact
we
were
forced
to
flee
very
early
in
the
trouble
and
as
there
seemed
to
be
more
need
of
his
services
here
in
new
york
than
in
any
of
the
neighbouring
countries
we
came
here
so
you
see
that
if
the
revolution
is
not
successful
his
estate
will
probably
be
confiscated
and
we
shall
be
penniless
he
is
the
agent
the
head
of
the
junta
i
suppose
you
would
call
it
here
in
new
engaged
in
purchasing
arms
and
ammunition
put
in
kennedy
as
she
paused
and
seeing
that
they
are
shipped
safely
to
new
orleans
as
agricultural
machinery
where
another
agent
receives
them
and
attends
to
their
safe
transit
across
the
she
nodded
and
after
a
moment
resumed
there
is
quite
a
little
colony
of
vespuccians
here
in
new
york
both
revolutionists
and
government
supporters
i
suppose
that
neither
of
you
has
any
idea
of
the
intriguing
that
is
going
on
under
the
peaceful
surface
right
here
in
your
own
city
but
there
is
much
of
it
more
than
even
i
know
or
can
tell
you
well
my
father
lately
has
been
acting
very
queerly
there
is
a
group
who
meet
frequently
at
the
home
of
a
senora
mendez
an
insurrecto
group
of
course
i
do
not
go
for
they
are
all
much
older
people
than
i
know
the
senora
well
but
i
prefer
a
different
kind
of
person
my
friends
are
younger
and
perhaps
more
radical
more
in
earnest
about
the
future
of
vespuccia
for
some
weeks
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
this
senora
mendez
has
had
too
much
influence
over
my
father
he
does
not
seem
like
the
same
man
he
used
to
be
indeed
some
of
the
junta
who
do
not
frequent
the
house
of
the
senora
have
remarked
it
he
seems
moody
works
by
starts
then
will
neglect
his
work
entirely
often
i
see
him
with
his
eyes
closed
apparently
sitting
quietly
oblivious
to
the
progress
of
the
cause
the
only
cause
now
which
can
restore
us
our
estate
the
other
day
we
lost
an
entire
shipment
of
arms
the
secret
service
captured
them
on
the
way
from
the
warehouse
on
south
street
to
the
steamer
which
was
to
take
them
to
new
orleans
only
once
before
had
it
happened
when
my
father
did
not
understand
all
the
things
to
conceal
then
he
was
frantic
for
a
week
but
this
time
he
seems
not
to
care
ah
senores
she
said
dropping
her
voice
i
fear
there
was
some
treachery
treachery
i
asked
and
have
you
any
suspicions
who
might
have
played
informer
she
hesitated
i
may
as
well
tell
you
just
what
i
suspect
i
fear
that
the
hold
of
senora
mendez
is
somehow
or
other
concerned
with
it
all
i
even
have
suspected
that
somehow
she
may
be
working
in
the
pay
of
the
government
that
she
is
a
vampire
living
on
the
secrets
of
the
group
who
so
trust
her
i
suspect
anything
everybody
that
she
is
poisoning
his
mind
perhaps
even
whispering
into
his
ear
some
siren
proposal
of
amnesty
and
his
estate
again
if
he
will
but
do
what
she
asks
my
poor
father
i
must
save
him
from
himself
if
it
is
necessary
argument
has
no
effect
with
him
he
merely
answers
that
the
senora
is
a
talented
and
accomplished
woman
and
laughs
a
vacant
laugh
when
i
hint
to
him
to
beware
i
hate
the
fiery
animosity
of
her
dark
eyes
boded
ill
i
felt
for
the
senora
but
it
flashed
over
me
that
perhaps
after
all
the
senora
was
not
a
traitress
but
had
simply
been
scheming
to
win
the
heart
and
hence
the
hacienda
of
the
great
when
he
came
into
possession
of
his
estate
if
the
revolution
proved
successful
and
finally
she
concluded
keeping
back
the
tears
by
an
heroic
effort
last
night
he
left
our
apartment
promising
to
return
early
in
the
evening
it
is
now
hours
and
i
have
heard
not
a
word
from
him
it
is
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
we
have
ever
been
separated
so
and
you
have
no
idea
where
he
could
have
gone
asked
craig
only
what
i
have
learned
from
senor
torreon
another
member
of
the
junta
senor
torreon
said
this
morning
that
he
left
the
home
of
senora
mendez
last
night
about
ten
in
company
with
my
father
he
says
they
parted
at
the
subway
as
they
lived
on
different
branches
of
the
road
professor
kennedy
she
added
springing
up
and
clasping
her
hands
tightly
in
an
appeal
that
was
irresistible
you
know
what
steps
to
take
to
find
him
i
trust
all
to
you
even
the
calling
on
the
police
though
i
think
it
would
be
best
if
we
could
get
along
without
them
find
my
father
senores
and
when
we
come
into
our
own
again
you
shall
not
regret
that
you
befriended
a
lonely
girl
in
a
strange
city
surrounded
by
intrigue
and
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
as
she
stood
swaying
before
us
the
tenseness
of
the
appeal
was
broken
by
the
sharp
ringing
of
the
telephone
bell
kennedy
quickly
took
down
the
receiver
your
maid
wishes
to
speak
to
you
he
said
handing
the
telephone
to
her
her
face
brightened
with
that
nervous
hope
that
springs
in
the
human
breast
even
in
the
blackest
moments
i
told
her
if
any
message
came
for
me
she
might
find
me
here
explained
miss
guerrero
yes
juanita
what
is
it
a
message
for
me
my
spanish
was
not
quite
good
enough
to
catch
more
than
a
word
here
and
there
in
the
low
conversation
but
i
could
guess
from
the
haggard
look
which
overspread
her
delicate
face
that
the
news
was
not
encouraging
oh
she
cried
this
is
terrible
terrible
what
shall
i
do
why
did
i
come
here
i
do
believe
it
i
do
believe
do
believe
what
miss
guerrero
asked
kennedy
reassuringly
trust
that
he
stole
the
money
oh
what
am
i
saying
you
must
not
look
for
him
you
must
forget
that
i
have
been
here
no
i
do
believe
what
money
asked
kennedy
disregarding
her
appeal
to
drop
the
case
remember
it
may
be
better
that
we
should
know
it
now
than
the
police
later
we
will
respect
your
the
junta
had
been
notified
a
few
days
ago
they
say
that
a
large
sum
five
hundred
thousand
silver
dollars
had
been
captured
from
the
government
and
was
on
its
way
to
new
york
to
be
melted
up
as
bullion
at
the
she
answered
repeating
what
she
had
heard
over
the
telephone
as
if
in
a
dream
mr
jameson
referred
to
the
rumour
when
he
came
in
i
was
interested
for
i
did
not
know
the
public
had
heard
of
it
yet
the
junta
has
just
announced
that
the
money
is
missing
as
soon
as
the
ship
docked
in
brooklyn
this
morning
an
agent
appeared
with
the
proper
credentials
from
my
father
and
a
guard
and
they
took
the
money
away
it
has
not
been
heard
of
since
and
they
have
no
word
from
my
her
face
was
blanched
as
she
realised
what
the
situation
was
here
she
was
setting
people
to
run
down
her
own
father
if
the
suspicions
of
the
other
members
of
the
junta
were
to
be
credited
you
you
do
not
think
my
father
stole
the
money
she
faltered
pitifully
say
you
do
not
think
i
think
nothing
yet
replied
kennedy
in
an
even
voice
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
find
him
before
the
detectives
of
the
junta
do
i
felt
a
tinge
i
must
confess
it
of
jealousy
as
kennedy
stood
beside
her
clasping
her
hand
in
both
of
his
and
gazing
earnestly
down
into
the
rich
flush
that
now
spread
over
her
olive
cheeks
miss
guerrero
he
said
you
may
trust
me
implicitly
if
your
father
is
alive
i
will
do
all
that
a
man
can
do
to
find
him
let
me
act
for
the
best
and
he
added
wheeling
quickly
toward
me
i
know
jameson
will
do
i
was
pulled
two
ways
at
once
i
believed
in
miss
guerrero
and
yet
the
flight
of
her
father
and
the
removal
of
the
bullion
swallowed
up
as
it
were
instantly
without
so
much
as
a
trace
in
new
york
looked
very
black
for
him
and
yet
as
she
placed
her
small
hand
tremblingly
in
mine
to
say
she
won
another
knight
to
go
forth
and
fight
her
battle
for
her
nor
do
i
think
that
i
am
more
than
ordinarily
susceptible
either
when
she
had
gone
i
looked
hopelessly
at
kennedy
how
could
we
find
a
missing
man
in
a
city
of
four
million
people
find
him
without
the
aid
of
the
police
perhaps
before
the
police
could
themselves
find
him
kennedy
seemed
to
appreciate
my
perplexity
as
though
he
read
my
thoughts
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
locate
this
senor
torreon
from
whom
the
first
information
came
he
remarked
as
we
left
the
apartment
miss
guerrero
told
me
that
he
might
possibly
be
found
in
an
obscure
in
the
bronx
where
several
members
of
the
junta
live
let
us
try
fortune
favoured
us
to
the
extent
that
we
did
find
torreon
at
the
address
given
he
made
no
effort
to
evade
us
though
i
noted
that
he
was
an
unprepossessing
looking
man
undersized
and
a
trifle
with
an
eye
that
never
met
yours
as
you
talked
with
him
whether
it
was
that
he
was
concealing
something
or
whether
he
was
merely
fearful
that
we
might
after
all
be
united
states
secret
service
men
or
whether
it
was
simply
a
lack
of
command
of
english
he
was
uncommonly
uncommunicative
at
first
he
repeated
sullenly
the
details
of
the
disappearance
of
guerrero
just
as
we
had
already
heard
them
and
you
simply
bade
him
as
you
got
on
a
subway
train
and
that
is
the
last
you
ever
saw
of
him
repeated
kennedy
yes
he
replied
did
he
seem
to
be
worried
to
have
anything
on
his
mind
to
act
queerly
in
any
way
asked
kennedy
keenly
no
came
the
monosyllabic
reply
and
there
was
just
that
shade
of
hesitation
about
it
that
made
me
wish
we
had
the
apparatus
we
used
in
the
bond
case
for
registering
association
time
kennedy
noticed
it
and
purposely
dropped
the
line
of
inquiry
in
order
not
to
excite
suspicion
i
understand
no
word
has
been
received
from
him
at
the
headquarters
on
south
street
none
replied
torreon
sharply
and
you
have
no
idea
where
he
could
have
gone
after
you
left
him
last
night
no
senor
this
answer
was
given
i
thought
with
suspicious
quickness
you
do
not
think
that
he
could
be
concealed
by
senora
mendez
then
asked
kennedy
quietly
the
little
man
jumped
forward
with
his
eyes
flashing
no
he
hissed
checking
this
show
of
feeling
as
quickly
as
he
could
well
then
observed
kennedy
rising
slowly
i
see
nothing
to
do
but
to
notify
the
police
and
have
a
general
alarm
sent
the
fire
died
in
the
eyes
of
torreon
do
not
do
that
senor
he
exclaimed
wait
at
least
one
day
more
perhaps
he
will
appear
perhaps
he
has
only
gone
up
to
bridgeport
to
see
about
some
arms
and
cartridges
who
can
tell
no
sir
do
not
call
in
the
police
i
beg
you
not
yet
i
myself
will
search
for
him
it
may
be
i
can
get
some
word
some
clue
if
i
can
i
will
notify
miss
guerrero
kennedy
turned
suddenly
torreon
he
flashed
quickly
what
do
you
suspect
about
that
shipment
of
half
a
million
silver
dollars
where
did
it
go
after
it
left
the
wharf
torreon
kept
his
composure
admirably
an
enigma
of
a
smile
flitted
over
his
mobile
features
as
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
ah
he
said
simply
then
you
have
heard
that
the
money
is
missing
perhaps
guerrero
has
not
gone
to
bridgeport
after
all
on
condition
that
i
do
not
notify
the
police
yet
will
you
take
us
to
visit
senora
mendez
and
let
us
learn
from
her
what
she
knows
of
this
strange
case
torreon
was
plainly
cornered
he
sat
for
a
moment
biting
his
nails
nervously
and
fidgeting
in
his
chair
it
shall
be
as
you
wish
he
assented
at
length
we
are
to
go
continued
kennedy
merely
as
friends
of
yours
you
understand
i
want
to
ask
questions
in
my
own
way
and
you
are
not
to
yes
yes
he
agreed
wait
i
will
tell
her
we
are
coming
and
he
reached
for
the
telephone
no
interrupted
kennedy
i
prefer
to
go
with
you
unexpected
put
down
the
telephone
otherwise
i
may
as
well
notify
my
friend
inspector
of
the
central
office
and
go
up
with
torreon
let
the
receiver
fall
back
in
its
socket
and
i
caught
just
a
glimpse
of
the
look
of
hate
and
suspicion
which
crossed
his
face
as
he
turned
toward
kennedy
when
he
spoke
it
was
as
suavely
as
if
he
himself
were
the
one
who
had
planned
this
little
excursion
it
shall
be
as
you
wish
he
said
leading
the
way
out
to
the
surface
cars
senora
mendez
received
us
politely
and
we
were
ushered
into
a
large
in
her
apartment
there
were
several
people
there
already
they
were
seated
in
easy
chairs
about
the
room
one
of
the
ladies
was
playing
on
the
piano
as
we
entered
it
was
a
curious
composition
very
rhythmic
with
a
peculiar
thread
of
monotonous
melody
running
through
it
the
playing
ceased
and
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
us
kennedy
kept
very
close
to
torreon
apparently
for
the
purpose
of
frustrating
any
attempt
at
a
whispered
conversation
with
the
senora
the
guests
rose
and
with
courtly
politeness
bowed
as
senora
mendez
presented
two
friends
of
senor
torreon
senor
kennedy
and
senor
jameson
we
were
introduced
in
turn
to
senor
and
senora
alvardo
senor
gonzales
senorita
reyes
and
the
player
senora
barrios
it
was
a
peculiar
situation
and
for
want
of
something
better
to
say
i
commented
on
the
curious
character
of
the
music
we
had
overheard
as
we
entered
the
senora
smiled
and
was
about
to
speak
when
a
servant
entered
bearing
a
tray
full
of
little
cups
with
a
steaming
liquid
and
in
a
silver
dish
some
curious
round
brown
buttons
about
an
inch
in
diameter
and
perhaps
a
quarter
of
an
inch
thick
torreon
motioned
frantically
to
the
servant
to
withdraw
but
kennedy
was
too
quick
for
him
interposing
himself
between
torreon
and
the
servant
he
made
way
for
her
to
enter
you
were
speaking
of
the
music
replied
senora
mendez
to
me
in
rich
full
tones
yes
it
is
very
curious
it
is
a
song
of
the
kiowa
indians
of
new
mexico
which
senora
barrios
has
endeavoured
to
set
to
music
so
that
it
can
be
rendered
on
the
piano
senora
barrios
and
myself
fled
from
vespuccia
to
mexico
at
the
start
of
our
revolution
and
when
the
mexican
government
ordered
us
to
leave
on
account
of
our
political
activity
we
merely
crossed
the
line
to
the
united
states
in
new
mexico
it
was
there
that
we
ran
across
this
very
curious
discovery
the
monotonous
beat
of
that
melody
you
heard
is
supposed
to
represent
the
beating
of
the
of
the
indians
during
their
mescal
rites
we
are
having
a
mescal
evening
here
whiling
away
the
hours
of
exile
from
our
native
mescal
i
repeated
blankly
at
first
then
feeling
a
nudge
from
kennedy
i
added
hastily
oh
yes
to
be
sure
i
think
i
have
heard
of
it
it
a
mexican
drink
is
it
not
i
have
never
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
it
or
of
tasting
that
other
drink
pulque
poolkay
did
i
get
the
accent
right
i
felt
another
sharper
nudge
from
kennedy
and
knew
that
i
had
only
made
matters
worse
mr
jameson
he
hastened
to
remark
confounds
this
mescal
of
the
indians
with
the
drink
of
the
same
name
that
is
common
in
oh
she
laughed
to
my
great
relief
but
this
mescal
is
something
quite
different
the
mexican
drink
mescal
is
made
from
the
and
is
a
frightfully
horrid
thing
that
sends
the
peon
out
of
his
senses
and
makes
him
violent
mescal
as
i
mean
it
is
a
little
shrub
a
god
a
cult
a
yes
assented
kennedy
discovered
by
those
same
kiowa
indians
was
it
not
perhaps
she
admitted
raising
her
beautiful
shoulders
in
polite
deprecation
the
mescal
religion
we
found
has
spread
very
largely
in
new
mexico
and
arizona
among
the
indians
and
with
the
removal
of
the
kiowas
to
the
indian
reservation
it
has
been
adopted
by
other
tribes
even
i
have
heard
as
far
north
as
the
canadian
is
that
so
asked
kennedy
i
understood
that
the
united
states
government
had
forbidden
the
importation
of
the
mescal
plant
and
its
sale
to
the
indians
under
severe
it
has
sir
interposed
alvardo
who
had
joined
us
but
still
the
mescal
cult
grows
secretly
for
my
part
i
think
it
might
be
more
wise
for
your
authorities
to
look
to
the
whiskey
and
beer
that
unscrupulous
persons
are
selling
senor
jameson
he
added
turning
to
me
will
you
join
us
in
a
little
cup
of
this
artificial
paradise
as
one
of
your
english
writers
havelock
ellis
i
think
has
appropriately
called
it
i
glanced
dubiously
at
kennedy
as
senora
mendez
took
one
of
the
little
buttons
out
of
the
silver
tray
carefully
paring
the
fuzzy
tuft
of
hairs
off
the
top
of
it
it
looked
to
me
very
much
like
the
tip
of
a
cactus
plant
which
indeed
it
was
she
rolled
it
into
a
little
pellet
and
placed
it
in
her
mouth
chewing
it
slowly
like
a
piece
of
chicle
watch
me
do
just
as
i
do
whispered
kennedy
to
me
at
a
moment
when
no
one
was
looking
the
servant
advanced
towards
us
with
the
tray
the
mescal
plant
explained
alvardo
pointing
at
the
little
discs
grows
precisely
like
these
little
buttons
which
you
see
here
it
is
a
species
of
cactus
which
rises
only
half
an
inch
or
so
from
the
ground
the
stem
is
surrounded
by
a
clump
of
blunt
leaves
which
give
it
its
button
shape
and
on
the
top
you
will
see
still
the
tuft
of
filaments
like
a
cactus
it
grows
in
the
rocky
soil
in
many
places
in
the
state
of
jalisco
though
only
recently
has
it
become
known
to
science
the
indians
when
they
go
out
to
gather
it
simply
lop
off
these
little
ends
as
they
peep
above
the
earth
dry
them
keep
what
they
wish
for
their
own
use
and
sell
the
rest
for
what
is
to
them
a
fabulous
sum
some
people
chew
the
buttons
while
a
few
have
lately
tried
making
an
infusion
or
tea
out
of
them
perhaps
to
a
beginner
i
had
better
recommend
the
i
had
scarcely
swallowed
the
bitter
almost
nauseous
decoction
than
i
began
to
feel
my
heart
action
slowing
up
and
my
pulse
beating
fuller
and
stronger
the
pupils
of
my
eyes
expanded
as
with
a
dose
of
belladonna
at
least
i
could
see
that
kennedy
did
and
so
mine
must
have
done
the
same
i
seemed
to
feel
an
elated
sense
of
superiority
really
i
almost
began
to
feel
that
it
was
i
not
kennedy
who
counted
most
in
this
investigation
i
have
since
learned
that
this
is
the
common
experience
of
this
sense
of
elation
but
the
feeling
of
physical
energy
and
intellectual
power
soon
wore
off
and
i
found
myself
glad
to
recline
in
my
easy
chair
as
the
rest
did
in
silent
indolence
still
the
display
that
followed
for
an
enchanted
hour
or
so
was
such
as
i
find
it
hopeless
to
describe
in
language
which
shall
convey
to
others
the
beauty
and
splendour
of
what
i
saw
i
picked
up
a
book
lying
on
the
table
before
me
a
pale
shadow
floated
across
the
page
before
me
leaving
an
of
pure
colour
that
was
indescribable
i
laid
down
the
book
and
closed
my
eyes
a
confused
riot
of
images
and
colours
like
a
kaleidoscope
crowded
before
me
at
first
indistinct
but
as
i
gazed
with
closed
yes
more
and
more
definite
golden
and
red
and
green
jewels
seemed
to
riot
before
me
i
bathed
my
hands
in
inconceivable
riches
of
beauty
such
as
no
worker
has
ever
produced
all
discomfort
ceased
i
had
no
desire
to
sleep
in
fact
was
but
it
was
a
real
effort
to
open
my
eyes
to
tear
myself
away
from
the
fascinating
visions
of
shapes
and
colours
at
last
i
did
open
my
eyes
to
gaze
at
the
gasjets
of
the
chandelier
as
they
flickered
they
seemed
to
send
out
waves
expanding
and
contracting
waves
of
colour
the
shadows
of
the
room
were
highly
coloured
and
constantly
changing
as
the
light
changed
senora
barrios
began
lightly
to
play
on
the
piano
the
transposed
kiowa
song
emphasising
the
notes
that
represented
the
strange
as
it
may
seem
the
music
translated
itself
into
pure
colour
and
the
rhythmic
beating
of
the
time
seemed
to
aid
the
process
i
thought
of
the
untutored
indians
as
they
sat
in
groups
about
the
flickering
while
others
beat
the
and
droned
the
curious
melody
what
were
the
visions
of
the
red
man
i
wondered
as
he
chewed
his
mescal
button
and
the
medicine
man
prayed
to
hikori
the
cactus
god
to
grant
a
beautiful
intoxication
under
the
of
the
chandelier
hung
a
cluster
of
electric
light
bulbs
which
added
to
the
flood
of
golden
effulgence
that
bathed
the
room
and
all
things
in
it
i
gazed
next
intently
at
the
electric
lights
they
became
the
sun
itself
in
their
steadiness
until
i
had
to
turn
away
my
head
and
close
my
eyes
even
then
the
image
persisted
i
saw
the
golden
sands
of
newport
only
they
were
blazing
with
glory
as
if
they
were
veritable
diamond
dust
i
saw
the
waves
of
incomparable
blue
rolling
up
on
the
shore
a
vague
perfume
was
wafted
on
the
air
i
was
in
an
orgy
of
vision
yet
there
was
no
stage
of
maudlin
emotion
it
was
at
least
elevating
kennedy
experiences
as
he
related
them
to
me
afterwards
were
similar
though
sufficiently
varied
to
be
interesting
his
visions
took
the
forms
of
animals
a
cheshire
cat
like
that
in
alice
in
wonderland
with
merely
a
grin
that
faded
away
changing
into
a
lynx
which
in
turn
disappeared
followed
by
an
unknown
creature
with
short
nose
and
pointed
ears
then
tortoises
and
a
perfectly
unrelated
succession
of
beasts
when
the
playing
began
a
beautiful
panorama
unfolded
before
him
the
regular
notes
in
the
music
enhancing
the
beauty
and
changes
in
the
scenes
which
he
described
as
a
most
wonderful
kinetoscopic
display
in
fact
only
de
quincey
or
bayard
taylor
or
poe
could
have
done
justice
to
the
thrilling
effects
of
the
drug
and
not
even
they
unless
an
amanuensis
had
been
seated
by
them
to
take
down
what
they
dictated
for
i
defy
anyone
to
remember
anything
but
a
fraction
of
the
rapid
march
of
changes
under
its
influence
indeed
in
observing
its
action
i
almost
forgot
for
the
time
being
the
purpose
of
our
visit
so
fascinated
was
i
the
music
ceased
but
not
the
visions
senora
mendez
advanced
toward
us
the
spangles
on
her
net
dress
seemed
to
give
her
a
appearance
she
seemed
to
float
over
the
carpet
like
a
glowing
fleecy
white
cloud
over
a
sky
kennedy
however
had
not
for
an
instant
forgotten
what
we
were
there
for
and
his
attention
recalled
mine
i
was
surprised
to
see
that
when
i
made
the
effort
i
could
talk
and
think
quite
as
rationally
as
ever
though
the
wildest
pranks
were
going
on
in
my
mind
and
vision
kennedy
did
not
beat
about
in
putting
his
question
evidently
counting
on
the
surprise
to
extract
the
truth
what
time
did
senor
guerrero
leave
last
night
the
question
came
so
suddenly
that
she
had
no
time
to
think
of
a
reply
that
would
conceal
anything
she
might
otherwise
have
wished
to
conceal
about
ten
she
answered
then
instantly
was
on
her
guard
for
torreon
had
caught
her
eye
and
you
have
no
idea
where
he
went
asked
kennedy
none
unless
he
went
home
she
replied
guardedly
i
did
not
at
the
time
notice
the
significance
of
her
prompt
response
to
torreon
warning
i
did
not
notice
as
did
kennedy
the
smile
that
spread
over
torreon
features
the
music
had
started
again
and
i
was
oblivious
to
all
but
the
riot
of
colour
again
the
servant
entered
she
seemed
clothed
in
a
halo
of
light
and
colour
every
fold
of
her
dress
radiating
the
most
delicate
tones
yet
there
was
nothing
voluptuous
or
sensual
about
it
i
was
raised
above
earthly
things
men
and
women
were
no
longer
men
and
women
they
were
brilliant
creatures
of
whom
i
was
one
it
was
sensuous
but
not
sensual
i
looked
at
my
own
clothes
my
everyday
suit
was
idealised
my
hands
were
surrounded
by
a
glow
of
red
fire
that
made
me
feel
that
they
must
be
the
hands
of
a
divinity
i
noticed
them
as
i
reached
forward
toward
the
tray
of
little
cups
there
swam
into
my
line
of
vision
another
such
hand
it
laid
itself
on
my
arm
a
voice
sang
in
my
ear
softly
no
walter
we
have
had
enough
come
let
us
go
this
is
not
like
any
other
known
drug
not
even
the
famous
cannabis
indica
hasheesh
let
us
go
as
soon
as
we
politely
can
i
have
found
out
what
i
wanted
to
know
guerrero
is
not
we
rose
shortly
and
excused
ourselves
and
with
general
regrets
in
which
all
but
torreon
joined
were
bowed
out
with
the
same
courtly
politeness
with
which
we
had
been
received
as
we
left
the
house
the
return
to
the
world
was
quick
it
was
like
coming
out
from
the
matinee
and
seeing
the
crowds
on
the
street
they
not
the
matinee
were
unreal
for
the
moment
but
strange
to
say
i
found
one
felt
no
depression
as
a
result
of
the
mescal
intoxication
what
is
it
about
mescal
that
produces
such
results
i
asked
the
alkaloids
replied
kennedy
as
we
walked
slowly
along
mescal
was
first
brought
to
the
attention
of
scientists
by
explorers
employed
by
our
bureau
of
ethnology
weir
mitchell
and
harvey
wiley
and
several
german
scientists
have
investigated
it
since
then
it
is
well
known
that
it
contains
half
a
dozen
alkaloids
and
resins
of
curious
and
nature
i
ca
recall
even
the
names
of
them
offhand
but
i
have
them
in
my
as
the
effect
of
the
mescal
began
to
wear
off
in
the
fresh
air
i
found
myself
in
a
peculiar
questioning
state
what
had
we
gained
by
our
visit
looking
calmly
at
it
i
could
not
help
but
ask
myself
why
both
torreon
and
senora
mendez
had
acted
as
if
they
were
concealing
something
about
the
whereabouts
of
guerrero
was
she
a
spy
did
she
know
anything
about
the
loss
of
the
dollars
of
one
thing
i
was
certain
torreon
was
an
ardent
admirer
of
the
beautiful
senora
equally
ardent
with
guerrero
was
he
simply
a
jealous
suitor
angry
at
his
rival
and
now
glad
that
he
was
out
of
the
way
where
had
guerrero
gone
the
question
was
still
unanswered
absorbed
in
these
reveries
i
did
not
notice
particularly
where
kennedy
was
hurrying
me
in
fact
finding
no
plausible
answer
to
my
speculations
and
knowing
that
it
was
useless
to
question
kennedy
at
this
stage
of
his
inquiry
i
did
not
for
the
moment
care
where
we
went
but
allowed
him
to
take
the
lead
we
entered
one
of
the
fine
apartments
on
the
drive
and
rode
up
in
the
elevator
a
door
opened
and
with
a
start
i
found
myself
in
the
presence
of
miss
guerrero
again
the
questioning
look
on
her
face
recalled
the
object
of
our
search
and
its
ill
success
so
far
why
had
kennedy
come
back
with
so
little
to
report
have
you
heard
anything
she
asked
eagerly
not
directly
replied
kennedy
but
i
have
a
clue
at
least
i
believe
that
torreon
knows
where
your
father
is
and
will
let
you
know
any
moment
now
it
is
to
his
interest
to
clear
himself
before
this
scandal
about
the
money
becomes
generally
known
would
you
allow
me
to
search
through
your
father
desk
for
some
moments
kennedy
rummaged
through
the
drawers
and
pigeonholes
silently
where
does
the
junta
keep
its
arms
stored
not
in
the
on
south
street
does
it
asked
kennedy
at
length
not
exactly
that
would
be
a
little
too
risky
she
replied
i
believe
they
have
a
loft
above
the
office
hired
in
someone
else
name
and
not
connected
with
the
place
at
all
my
father
and
senor
torreon
are
the
only
ones
who
have
the
keys
why
do
you
ask
i
ask
replied
craig
because
i
was
wondering
whether
there
might
not
be
something
that
would
take
him
down
to
south
street
last
night
it
is
the
only
place
i
can
think
of
his
going
to
at
such
a
late
hour
unless
he
has
gone
out
of
town
if
we
do
not
hear
from
torreon
soon
i
think
i
will
try
what
i
can
find
down
there
ah
what
is
this
kennedy
drew
forth
a
little
silver
box
and
opened
it
inside
reposed
a
dozen
mescal
buttons
we
both
looked
quickly
at
miss
guerrero
but
it
was
quite
evident
that
she
was
unacquainted
with
them
she
was
about
to
ask
what
kennedy
had
found
when
the
telephone
rang
and
the
maid
announced
that
miss
guerrero
was
wanted
by
senor
torreon
a
smile
of
gratification
flitted
over
kennedy
face
as
he
leaned
over
to
me
and
whispered
it
is
evident
that
torreon
is
anxious
to
clear
himself
i
wager
he
has
done
some
rapid
hustling
since
we
left
perhaps
this
is
some
word
about
my
father
at
last
murmured
miss
guerrero
as
she
nervously
hurried
to
the
telephone
and
answered
yes
this
is
senorita
guerrero
senor
torreon
you
are
at
the
office
of
the
junta
yes
yes
you
have
word
from
my
father
you
went
down
there
expecting
some
guns
to
be
delivered
and
you
found
him
there
in
the
loft
ill
did
you
say
unconscious
in
an
instant
her
face
was
drawn
and
pale
and
the
receiver
fell
clattering
to
the
floor
from
her
nerveless
fingers
he
is
dead
she
gasped
as
she
swayed
backward
and
i
caught
her
with
kennedy
help
i
carried
her
limp
and
unconscious
across
the
room
and
placed
her
in
a
deep
armchair
i
stood
at
her
side
but
for
the
moment
could
only
look
on
helplessly
blankly
at
the
now
stony
beauty
of
her
face
some
water
juanita
quick
i
cried
as
soon
as
i
had
recovered
from
the
shock
have
you
any
or
anything
of
that
sort
perhaps
you
can
find
a
little
brandy
while
we
were
making
her
comfortable
the
telephone
continued
to
tinkle
this
is
kennedy
i
heard
craig
say
as
juanita
came
hurrying
in
with
water
and
brandy
you
fool
she
fainted
why
you
break
it
to
her
gently
what
that
address
on
south
street
you
found
him
over
the
junta
in
a
loft
yes
i
understand
what
were
you
doing
down
there
you
went
down
expecting
a
shipment
of
arms
and
saw
a
light
overhead
i
see
and
suspecting
something
you
entered
with
a
policeman
you
heard
him
move
across
the
floor
above
and
fall
heavily
all
right
someone
will
be
down
directly
ambulance
surgeon
has
tried
everything
you
say
no
heart
action
no
breathing
sure
very
well
let
the
body
remain
just
where
it
is
until
i
get
down
oh
wait
how
long
ago
did
it
happen
fifteen
minutes
all
right
such
restoratives
as
we
had
found
we
applied
faithfully
at
last
we
were
rewarded
by
the
first
flutter
of
an
eyelid
then
miss
guerrero
gazed
wildly
about
he
is
dead
she
moaned
they
have
killed
him
i
know
it
my
father
is
over
and
over
she
repeated
he
is
dead
i
shall
never
see
him
vainly
i
tried
to
soothe
her
what
was
there
to
say
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
it
torreon
must
have
gone
down
directly
after
we
left
senora
mendez
he
had
seen
a
light
in
the
loft
had
entered
with
a
policeman
as
a
witness
he
had
told
craig
over
the
telephone
had
heard
guerrero
fall
and
had
sent
for
the
ambulance
how
long
guerrero
had
been
there
he
did
not
know
for
while
members
of
the
junta
had
been
coming
and
going
all
day
in
the
office
below
none
had
gone
up
into
the
locked
loft
kennedy
with
rare
skill
calmed
miss
guerrero
hysteria
into
a
gentle
rain
of
tears
which
relieved
her
overwrought
feelings
we
silently
withdrew
leaving
the
two
women
mistress
and
servant
weeping
craig
i
asked
when
we
had
gained
the
street
what
do
you
make
of
it
we
must
lose
no
time
arrest
this
mendez
woman
before
she
has
a
chance
to
not
so
fast
walter
he
cautioned
as
we
spun
along
in
a
taxicab
our
case
is
very
complete
against
anybody
but
it
looks
black
for
guerrero
i
admitted
dead
men
tell
no
tales
even
to
clear
it
all
depends
on
speed
now
he
answered
laconically
we
had
reached
the
university
which
was
only
a
few
blocks
away
and
craig
dashed
into
his
laboratory
while
i
settled
with
the
driver
he
reappeared
almost
instantly
with
some
bulky
apparatus
under
his
arm
and
we
more
than
ran
from
the
building
to
the
subway
station
fortunately
there
was
an
express
just
pulling
in
as
we
tumbled
down
the
steps
to
one
who
knows
south
street
as
merely
a
street
whose
glory
of
other
days
has
long
since
departed
where
an
antiquated
horsecar
now
ambles
slowly
uptown
and
trucks
and
carts
all
day
long
are
in
a
perpetual
jam
it
is
peculiarly
uninteresting
by
day
and
peculiarly
deserted
and
vicious
by
night
but
there
is
another
fascination
about
south
street
perhaps
there
has
never
been
a
revolution
in
latin
america
which
has
not
in
some
way
or
other
been
connected
with
this
street
whence
hundreds
of
filibustering
expeditions
have
started
whenever
a
dictator
is
to
be
overthrown
or
half
a
dozen
generals
in
the
caribbean
become
dissatisfied
with
their
portions
of
gold
lace
the
and
of
south
street
can
give
if
they
choose
an
advance
scenario
of
the
whole
tragedy
or
comic
opera
as
the
case
may
be
real
war
or
it
is
all
grist
for
the
mills
of
these
individuals
our
quest
took
us
to
a
ramshackle
building
reminiscent
of
the
days
when
the
street
bristled
with
bowsprits
of
ships
from
all
over
the
world
an
age
when
the
american
merchantman
flew
our
flag
on
the
uttermost
of
the
on
the
ground
floor
was
an
apparently
innocent
junk
shop
in
reality
the
of
the
junta
by
an
outside
stairway
the
lofts
above
were
reached
hiding
their
secrets
behind
windows
opaque
with
decades
of
dust
at
the
door
we
were
met
by
torreon
and
the
policeman
both
appeared
to
be
shocked
beyond
measure
torreon
was
profuse
in
explanations
which
did
not
explain
out
of
the
tangled
mass
of
verbiage
i
did
manage
to
extract
however
the
impression
that
come
what
might
to
the
other
members
of
the
junta
torreon
was
determined
to
clear
his
own
name
at
any
cost
he
and
the
policeman
had
discovered
senor
guerrero
only
a
short
time
before
for
all
he
knew
guerrero
had
been
there
some
time
perhaps
all
day
while
the
others
were
meeting
except
for
the
light
he
might
have
been
there
undiscovered
still
torreon
swore
he
had
heard
guerrero
fall
the
policeman
was
not
quite
so
positive
kennedy
listened
impatiently
then
sprang
up
the
stairs
only
to
call
back
to
the
policeman
go
call
me
a
taxicab
at
the
ferry
an
electric
cab
mind
now
not
a
we
found
the
victim
lying
on
a
sort
of
bed
of
sailcloth
in
a
loft
apparently
devoted
to
the
peaceful
purposes
of
the
junk
trade
but
really
a
perfect
arsenal
and
magazine
it
was
dusty
and
cobwebbed
crammed
with
stands
of
arms
tents
uniforms
in
bales
batteries
of
maxims
and
and
all
the
paraphernalia
for
carrying
on
a
real
revolution
the
young
ambulance
surgeon
was
still
there
so
quickly
had
we
been
able
to
get
he
had
his
hypodermic
syringe
emetics
and
various
tubes
spread
out
on
a
piece
of
linen
on
a
kennedy
at
once
inquired
just
what
he
had
done
thought
at
first
it
was
only
a
bad
case
of
syncope
he
replied
but
i
guess
he
was
dead
some
minutes
before
i
got
here
tried
rhythmic
traction
of
the
tongue
artificial
respiration
stimulants
chest
and
heart
massage
everything
but
it
was
no
use
have
you
any
idea
what
caused
his
death
asked
craig
as
he
hastily
adjusted
his
apparatus
to
an
electric
light
socket
a
rheostat
an
of
peculiar
shape
and
an
poison
of
some
kind
an
alkaloid
they
say
they
heard
him
fall
as
they
came
and
when
they
got
to
him
he
was
blue
his
face
was
as
blue
as
it
is
now
when
i
arrived
asphyxia
failure
of
both
heart
and
lungs
that
was
what
the
alkaloid
the
gong
of
the
electric
cab
sounded
outside
as
craig
heard
it
he
rushed
with
two
wires
to
the
window
threw
them
out
and
hurried
downstairs
attaching
them
to
the
batteries
of
the
cab
in
an
instant
he
was
back
again
now
doctor
he
said
i
going
to
perform
a
very
delicate
test
on
this
man
here
i
have
the
alternating
city
current
and
here
a
direct
continuous
current
from
the
of
the
cab
below
doctor
hold
his
mouth
open
so
now
have
you
a
pair
of
forceps
handy
good
can
you
catch
hold
of
the
tip
of
his
tongue
there
do
just
as
i
tell
you
i
apply
this
cathode
to
his
skin
in
the
dorsal
region
under
the
back
of
the
neck
and
this
anode
in
the
lumbar
region
at
the
base
of
the
spine
just
pieces
of
cotton
soaked
in
salt
solution
and
covering
the
metal
electrodes
to
give
me
a
good
contact
with
the
i
was
fascinated
it
was
gruesome
and
yet
i
could
not
take
my
eyes
off
it
torreon
stood
blankly
in
a
daze
craig
was
as
calm
as
if
his
work
was
experimenting
on
cadavers
he
applied
the
current
moving
the
anode
and
the
cathode
slowly
i
had
often
seen
the
experiments
on
the
nerves
of
a
frog
that
had
been
freshly
killed
how
the
electric
current
will
make
the
muscles
twitch
as
discovered
long
ago
by
galvani
but
i
was
not
prepared
to
see
it
on
a
human
being
torreon
muttered
something
and
crossed
himself
the
arms
seemed
half
to
rise
then
suddenly
to
fall
flabby
again
there
was
a
light
hiss
like
an
inspiration
and
expiration
of
air
a
ghastly
sound
lungs
react
muttered
kennedy
but
the
heart
does
i
must
increase
the
again
he
applied
the
electrodes
the
face
seemed
a
different
shade
of
blue
i
thought
good
god
kennedy
i
exclaimed
do
you
suppose
the
effect
of
that
mescal
on
me
has
worn
off
yet
blue
blue
everything
blue
is
playing
pranks
before
my
eyes
tell
me
is
the
blue
of
that
face
his
face
is
it
changing
do
you
see
it
or
do
i
imagine
it
blood
asphyxiated
was
the
disjointed
reply
the
oxygen
is
clearing
but
kennedy
i
persisted
his
face
was
dark
blue
black
a
minute
ago
the
most
astonishing
change
has
taken
place
its
colour
is
almost
natural
now
do
i
imagine
it
or
is
it
real
kennedy
was
so
absorbed
in
his
work
that
he
made
no
reply
at
all
he
heard
nothing
nothing
save
the
slow
forced
inspiration
and
expiration
of
air
as
he
deftly
and
quickly
manipulated
the
electrodes
doctor
he
cried
at
length
tell
me
what
is
going
on
in
that
the
young
surgeon
bent
his
head
and
placed
his
ear
on
the
cold
breast
as
he
raised
his
eyes
and
they
chanced
to
rest
on
kennedy
hands
holding
the
electrodes
dangling
idly
in
the
air
i
think
i
never
saw
a
greater
look
of
astonishment
on
a
human
face
it
is
almost
natural
he
gasped
with
great
care
and
a
milk
diet
for
a
few
days
guerrero
will
live
said
kennedy
quietly
it
is
my
god
man
but
he
was
dead
exclaimed
the
surgeon
i
know
it
his
heart
was
stopped
and
his
lungs
to
all
intents
and
purposes
he
was
dead
dead
as
ever
a
man
was
replied
craig
and
would
be
now
if
i
had
happened
to
think
of
this
special
loaned
to
me
by
a
doctor
who
had
studied
deeply
the
process
of
electric
resuscitation
developed
by
professor
leduc
of
the
nantes
ecole
de
medicin
there
is
only
one
case
i
know
of
on
record
which
compares
with
this
a
case
of
a
girl
resuscitated
in
paris
the
girl
was
a
chronic
and
was
forty
i
stood
like
one
frozen
the
thing
was
so
incomprehensible
after
the
many
surprises
of
the
evening
that
had
preceded
torreon
in
fact
did
not
comprehend
for
the
moment
as
kennedy
and
i
bent
over
guerrero
eyes
opened
but
he
apparently
saw
nothing
his
hand
moved
a
little
and
his
lips
parted
kennedy
quickly
reached
into
the
pockets
of
the
man
gasping
for
breath
one
after
another
from
a
vest
pocket
he
drew
a
little
silver
case
identical
with
that
he
had
found
in
the
desk
he
opened
it
and
one
mescal
button
rolled
out
into
the
palm
of
his
hand
kennedy
regarded
it
thoughtfully
i
suspect
there
is
at
least
one
devotee
of
the
drug
who
will
no
longer
cultivate
its
use
as
a
result
of
this
he
added
looking
significantly
at
the
man
before
us
guerrero
shouted
kennedy
placing
his
mouth
close
to
the
man
ear
but
muting
his
voice
so
that
only
i
could
distinguish
what
he
said
guerrero
where
is
the
money
his
lips
moved
trembling
again
but
i
could
not
make
out
that
he
said
anything
kennedy
rose
and
quietly
went
over
to
detach
his
apparatus
from
the
electric
light
socket
behind
torreon
i
heard
as
i
turned
suddenly
craig
had
torreon
firmly
pinioned
from
behind
by
both
arms
the
policeman
quickly
interposed
it
all
right
officer
exclaimed
craig
walter
reach
into
his
inside
i
pulled
out
a
bunch
of
papers
and
turned
them
over
what
that
asked
kennedy
as
i
came
to
something
neatly
enclosed
in
an
envelope
i
opened
it
it
was
a
power
of
attorney
from
guerrero
to
torreon
perhaps
it
is
no
crime
to
give
a
man
mescal
if
he
wants
it
i
doubt
if
the
penal
code
covers
that
ejaculated
kennedy
but
it
is
conspiracy
to
give
it
to
him
and
extract
a
power
of
attorney
by
which
you
can
get
control
of
trust
funds
consigned
to
him
manuel
torreon
the
game
is
up
you
and
senora
mendez
have
played
your
parts
well
but
you
have
lost
you
waited
until
you
thought
guerrero
was
dead
then
you
took
a
policeman
along
as
a
witness
to
clear
yourself
but
the
secret
is
not
dead
after
all
is
there
nothing
else
in
those
papers
walter
yes
ah
a
bill
of
lading
dated
ten
cases
of
iron
from
new
york
to
boston
a
long
chance
for
such
valuable
senor
but
i
suppose
you
had
to
get
the
money
away
from
new
york
at
any
and
senora
mendez
i
asked
as
my
mind
involuntarily
reverted
to
the
brilliantly
lighted
room
what
part
did
she
have
in
the
plot
against
guerrero
torreon
stood
sullenly
silent
kennedy
reached
in
another
of
pockets
and
drew
out
a
third
little
silver
box
of
mescal
buttons
holding
all
three
of
the
boxes
identically
the
same
before
us
he
remarked
evidently
torreon
was
not
averse
to
having
his
victim
under
the
influence
of
mescal
as
much
as
possible
he
must
have
forced
it
on
him
all
fair
in
love
and
revolution
i
suppose
i
believe
he
brought
him
down
here
under
the
influence
of
mescal
last
night
obtained
the
power
of
attorney
and
left
him
here
to
die
of
the
mescal
intoxication
it
was
just
a
case
of
too
strong
a
hold
of
the
mescal
the
artificial
paradise
was
too
alluring
to
guerrero
and
torreon
knew
it
and
tried
to
profit
by
it
to
the
extent
of
half
a
million
it
was
more
than
i
could
grasp
at
the
instant
the
impossible
had
happened
i
had
seen
the
dead
literally
brought
back
to
life
and
the
secret
which
the
criminal
believed
buried
wrung
from
the
grave
kennedy
must
have
noted
the
puzzled
look
on
my
face
walter
he
said
casually
as
he
wrapped
up
his
instruments
do
stand
there
gaping
like
billikin
our
part
in
this
case
is
finished
at
least
mine
is
but
i
suspect
from
some
of
the
glances
i
have
seen
you
steal
at
various
times
that
well
perhaps
you
would
like
a
few
moments
in
a
real
paradise
i
saw
a
telephone
go
call
up
miss
guerrero
and
tell
her
her
father
is
alive
and
xii
the
steel
door
it
was
what
in
college
we
used
to
call
good
football
weather
a
crisp
autumn
afternoon
that
sent
the
blood
tingling
through
brain
and
muscle
kennedy
and
i
were
enjoying
a
stroll
on
the
drive
dividing
our
attention
between
the
glowing
red
sunset
across
the
hudson
and
the
string
of
automobiles
on
the
broad
parkway
suddenly
a
huge
black
touring
car
marked
with
big
letters
shot
past
again
in
one
of
the
city
cars
i
remarked
i
thought
the
last
police
department
had
put
a
stop
to
perhaps
it
has
returned
kennedy
did
you
see
who
was
in
the
car
no
but
i
see
it
has
turned
and
is
coming
it
was
inspector
i
mean
first
deputy
i
thought
he
recognised
us
as
he
whizzed
along
and
i
guess
he
did
too
ah
congratulations
i
have
had
a
chance
to
tell
you
before
how
pleased
i
was
to
learn
you
had
been
appointed
first
deputy
it
ought
to
have
been
commissioner
though
added
kennedy
congratulations
nothing
rejoined
just
another
coming
on
mayor
must
make
a
show
of
getting
some
reform
done
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
so
he
began
with
the
police
department
and
here
i
am
first
deputy
but
say
kennedy
he
added
dropping
his
voice
i
a
little
job
on
my
mind
that
i
like
to
pull
off
in
about
as
spectacular
a
fashion
as
i
as
you
know
how
i
want
to
make
good
conspicuously
good
at
the
start
understand
maybe
i
be
for
it
and
sent
to
pounding
the
pavements
of
dismissalville
but
i
do
care
i
take
a
chance
on
the
level
kennedy
it
a
big
thing
and
it
ought
to
be
done
will
you
help
me
put
it
across
what
is
it
asked
kennedy
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
at
estimate
of
the
security
of
his
tenure
of
office
drew
us
away
from
the
automobile
toward
the
stone
parapet
overlooking
the
railroad
and
river
far
below
and
out
of
earshot
of
the
department
chauffeur
i
want
to
pull
off
a
successful
raid
on
the
vesper
club
he
whispered
earnestly
scanning
our
faces
good
heavens
man
i
ejaculated
do
you
know
that
senator
danfield
is
interested
in
jameson
interrupted
reproachfully
i
said
the
level
a
few
moments
ago
and
i
meant
it
senator
danfield
he
well
anyhow
if
i
do
do
it
the
district
attorney
will
with
the
aid
of
the
dowling
law
and
i
am
going
to
beat
him
to
it
that
all
there
too
much
money
being
lost
at
the
vesper
club
anyhow
it
wo
hurt
danfield
to
be
taught
a
lesson
not
to
run
such
a
phony
game
i
may
like
to
put
up
a
quiet
bet
myself
on
the
ponies
now
and
then
i
wo
say
i
do
but
this
thing
of
danfield
has
got
beyond
all
reason
it
the
crookedest
gambling
joint
in
the
city
at
least
judging
by
the
stories
they
tell
of
losses
there
and
so
beastly
aristocratic
too
read
shoved
a
letter
into
kennedy
hand
a
dainty
perfumed
and
monogrammed
little
missive
addressed
in
a
feminine
hand
it
was
such
a
letter
as
comes
by
the
thousand
to
the
police
in
the
course
of
a
year
though
seldom
from
ladies
of
the
smart
set
dear
sir
i
notice
in
the
newspapers
this
morning
that
you
have
just
been
appointed
first
deputy
commissioner
of
police
and
that
you
have
been
ordered
to
suppress
gambling
in
new
york
for
the
love
that
you
must
still
bear
toward
your
own
mother
listen
to
the
story
of
a
mother
worn
with
anxiety
for
her
only
son
and
if
there
is
any
justice
or
righteousness
in
this
great
city
close
up
a
gambling
hell
that
is
sending
to
ruin
scores
of
our
finest
young
men
no
doubt
you
know
or
have
heard
of
my
family
the
delongs
are
not
unknown
in
new
york
perhaps
you
have
also
heard
of
the
losses
of
my
son
percival
at
the
vesper
club
they
are
fast
becoming
the
common
talk
of
our
set
i
am
not
rich
commissioner
in
spite
of
our
social
position
but
i
am
human
as
human
as
a
mother
in
any
station
of
life
and
oh
if
there
is
any
way
close
up
that
gilded
society
resort
that
is
dissipating
our
small
fortune
ruining
an
only
son
and
slowly
bringing
to
the
grave
a
widow
as
worthy
of
protection
as
any
mother
of
the
poor
whose
plea
has
closed
up
a
little
poolroom
or
low
policy
sincerely
julia
delong
please
keep
this
confidential
at
least
from
my
son
percival
del
well
said
kennedy
as
he
handed
back
the
letter
if
you
do
it
i
take
back
all
the
hard
things
i
ever
said
about
the
police
system
young
delong
was
in
one
of
my
classes
at
the
university
until
he
was
expelled
for
that
last
mad
prank
of
his
there
more
to
that
boy
than
most
people
think
but
he
the
wildest
scion
of
wealth
i
have
ever
come
in
contact
with
how
are
you
going
to
pull
off
your
raid
is
it
to
be
down
through
the
skylight
or
up
from
the
cellar
kennedy
replied
in
the
same
reproachful
tone
with
which
he
had
addressed
me
talk
sense
i
in
earnest
you
know
the
vesper
club
is
barred
and
barricaded
like
the
national
city
bank
it
is
one
of
those
common
gambling
joints
which
depend
for
protection
on
what
we
call
doors
it
proof
against
all
the
old
methods
axes
and
would
make
no
impression
your
predecessor
had
some
success
at
opening
doors
with
a
hydraulic
jack
i
believe
in
some
very
difficult
raids
put
in
kennedy
a
hydraulic
jack
would
do
for
the
vesper
club
i
afraid
remarked
wearily
why
sir
that
place
has
been
proved
sir
you
remember
recently
the
war
in
which
some
rivals
exploded
a
bomb
on
the
steps
it
did
more
damage
to
the
house
next
door
than
to
the
club
however
i
can
get
past
the
outer
door
i
think
even
if
it
is
strong
but
inside
you
must
have
heard
of
it
is
the
famous
steel
door
three
inches
thick
made
of
armourplate
it
no
use
to
try
it
at
all
unless
we
can
pass
that
door
with
reasonable
quickness
all
the
evidence
we
shall
get
will
be
of
an
innocent
social
downstairs
the
gambling
is
all
on
the
second
floor
beyond
this
door
in
a
room
without
a
window
in
it
surely
you
heard
of
that
famous
with
its
perfect
system
of
artificial
ventilation
and
electric
lighting
that
makes
it
rival
noonday
at
midnight
and
do
tell
me
i
got
to
get
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
by
strategy
either
it
is
the
system
of
lookouts
is
perfect
no
force
is
necessary
but
it
must
not
be
destructive
of
life
or
property
or
by
heaven
i
drive
up
there
and
riddle
the
place
with
a
gun
exclaimed
h
mused
kennedy
as
he
flicked
the
ashes
off
his
cigar
and
meditatively
watched
a
passing
on
the
railroad
below
us
there
goes
a
car
loaded
with
tons
and
tons
of
scrap
iron
you
want
me
to
scrap
that
steel
door
do
you
kennedy
i
buy
that
particular
scrap
from
you
at
almost
its
weight
in
gold
the
fact
is
i
have
a
secret
fund
at
my
disposal
such
as
former
commissioners
have
asked
for
in
vain
i
can
afford
to
pay
you
well
as
well
as
any
private
client
and
i
hear
you
have
had
some
good
fees
lately
only
deliver
the
no
answered
kennedy
rather
piqued
it
is
money
that
i
am
after
i
merely
wanted
to
be
sure
that
you
are
in
earnest
i
can
get
you
past
that
door
as
if
it
were
made
of
green
it
was
turn
to
look
incredulous
but
as
kennedy
apparently
meant
exactly
what
he
said
he
simply
asked
and
will
you
i
will
do
it
if
you
say
so
replied
kennedy
quietly
are
you
ready
for
answer
simply
grasped
craig
hand
as
if
to
seal
the
compact
all
right
then
continued
kennedy
send
a
one
of
those
closed
vans
that
the
storage
warehouses
use
up
to
my
laboratory
any
time
before
seven
how
many
men
will
you
need
in
the
raid
twelve
will
a
van
hold
that
many
comfortably
i
want
to
put
some
apparatus
in
it
but
that
wo
take
much
why
yes
i
think
so
answered
i
get
a
van
so
that
they
wo
be
badly
jolted
by
the
ride
by
george
kennedy
i
see
you
know
more
of
that
side
of
police
strategy
than
i
gave
you
credit
then
have
the
men
drop
into
my
laboratory
singly
about
the
same
time
you
can
arrange
that
so
that
it
will
not
look
suspicious
so
far
uptown
it
will
be
dark
anyhow
perhaps
you
can
make
up
as
the
driver
yourself
anyhow
get
one
you
can
trust
absolutely
then
have
the
van
down
near
the
corner
of
broadway
below
the
club
driving
slowly
along
about
the
time
the
theatre
crowd
is
out
leave
the
rest
to
me
i
will
give
you
or
the
driver
orders
when
the
time
as
thanked
craig
he
remarked
without
a
shade
of
insincerity
kennedy
talk
about
being
commissioner
you
ought
to
be
wait
till
i
deliver
the
goods
answered
craig
simply
i
may
fall
down
and
bring
you
nothing
but
a
lawsuit
for
damages
for
unlawful
entry
or
unjust
persecution
or
whatever
they
call
i
take
a
chance
at
that
called
back
as
he
jumped
into
his
car
and
directed
headquarters
as
the
car
disappeared
kennedy
filled
his
lungs
with
air
as
if
reluctant
to
leave
the
drive
our
constitutional
he
remarked
is
abruptly
at
an
end
then
he
laughed
as
he
looked
about
him
what
a
place
in
which
to
plot
a
raid
on
danfield
vesper
club
why
the
have
hardly
got
the
children
all
in
for
supper
and
bed
it
incongruous
well
i
must
go
over
to
the
laboratory
and
get
some
things
ready
to
put
in
that
van
with
the
men
meet
me
about
seven
walter
up
in
the
room
all
togged
up
we
dine
at
the
cafe
riviera
in
style
and
by
the
way
you
quite
a
man
about
town
you
must
know
someone
who
can
introduce
us
into
the
vesper
but
craig
i
demurred
if
there
is
any
rough
work
as
a
result
it
might
queer
me
with
them
they
might
object
to
being
used
oh
that
will
be
all
right
i
just
want
to
look
the
place
over
and
lose
a
few
chips
in
a
good
cause
no
it
wo
queer
any
of
your
star
connections
we
be
on
the
outside
when
the
time
comes
for
anything
to
happen
in
fact
i
should
wonder
if
your
story
would
make
you
all
the
more
solid
with
the
sports
i
take
all
the
responsibility
you
can
have
the
glory
you
know
they
like
to
hear
the
inside
gossip
of
such
things
after
the
event
try
it
remember
at
we
be
a
little
late
at
dinner
but
never
mind
it
will
be
early
enough
for
the
left
to
my
own
devices
i
determined
to
do
a
little
detective
work
on
my
own
account
and
not
only
did
i
succeed
in
finding
an
acquaintance
who
agreed
to
introduce
us
at
the
vesper
club
that
night
about
nine
but
i
also
learned
that
percival
delong
was
certain
to
be
there
that
night
too
i
was
necessarily
vague
about
kennedy
for
fear
my
friend
might
have
heard
of
some
of
his
exploits
but
fortunately
he
did
not
prove
inquisitive
i
hurried
back
to
our
apartment
and
was
in
the
process
of
transforming
myself
into
a
boulevardier
when
kennedy
arrived
in
an
extremely
cheerful
frame
of
mind
so
far
his
preparations
had
progressed
very
favourably
i
guessed
and
i
was
quite
elated
when
he
complimented
me
on
what
i
had
accomplished
in
the
meantime
pretty
tough
for
the
fellows
who
are
condemned
to
ride
around
in
that
van
for
four
mortal
hours
though
he
said
as
he
hurried
into
his
evening
clothes
but
they
wo
be
riding
all
the
time
the
driver
will
make
frequent
i
was
so
busy
that
i
paid
little
attention
to
him
until
he
had
nearly
completed
his
toilet
i
gave
a
gasp
why
whatever
are
you
doing
i
exclaimed
as
i
glanced
into
his
room
there
stood
kennedy
arrayed
in
all
the
glory
of
a
moustache
and
a
goatee
he
had
put
on
evening
clothes
of
decidedly
parisian
cut
clothes
which
he
had
used
abroad
and
had
brought
back
with
him
but
which
i
had
never
known
him
to
wear
since
he
came
back
on
a
chair
reposed
a
hat
that
would
have
been
pronounced
faultless
on
the
continong
but
was
unknown
except
among
impresarios
on
broadway
kennedy
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
even
had
the
shrug
figure
to
yourself
monsieur
he
said
ze
great
kennedy
ze
detectif
americain
to
put
it
tersely
in
our
own
vernacular
would
it
be
a
fool
thing
for
me
to
appear
at
the
vesper
club
where
i
should
surely
be
recognised
by
someone
if
i
went
in
my
ordinary
clothes
and
features
un
faux
pas
at
the
start
jamais
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
agree
and
i
was
glad
that
i
had
been
discreetly
reticent
about
my
companion
in
talking
with
the
friend
who
was
to
gain
us
entrance
to
the
avernus
beyond
the
steel
door
we
met
my
friend
at
the
riviera
and
dined
sumptuously
fortunately
he
seemed
decidedly
impressed
with
my
friend
monsieur
kay
i
could
do
no
better
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
than
take
kennedy
initial
which
seemed
to
serve
we
progressed
amicably
from
oysters
and
soup
down
to
coffee
cigars
and
liqueurs
and
i
succeeded
in
swallowing
tales
of
monte
carlo
and
ostend
and
ascot
without
even
a
smile
he
must
have
heard
them
somewhere
and
treasured
them
up
for
just
such
an
occasion
but
he
told
them
in
a
manner
that
was
verisimilitude
itself
using
perfect
english
with
just
the
trace
of
an
accent
at
the
right
places
at
last
it
was
time
to
saunter
around
to
the
vesper
club
without
seeming
to
be
too
indecently
early
the
theatres
were
not
yet
out
but
my
friend
said
play
was
just
beginning
at
the
club
and
would
soon
be
in
full
swing
i
had
a
keen
sense
of
wickedness
as
we
mounted
the
steps
in
the
yellow
flare
of
the
flaming
on
the
broadway
corner
not
far
below
us
a
heavy
grated
door
swung
open
at
the
practised
signal
of
my
friend
and
an
obsequious
negro
servant
stood
bowing
and
pronouncing
his
name
in
the
sombre
mahogany
portal
beyond
with
its
green
marble
pillars
and
handsome
decorations
a
short
parley
followed
after
which
we
entered
my
friend
having
apparently
satisfied
someone
that
we
were
all
right
we
did
not
stop
to
examine
the
first
floor
which
doubtless
was
innocent
enough
but
turned
quickly
up
a
flight
of
steps
at
the
foot
of
the
broad
staircase
kennedy
paused
to
examine
some
rich
carvings
and
i
felt
him
nudge
me
i
turned
it
was
an
enclosed
staircase
with
walls
that
looked
to
be
of
concrete
swung
back
on
hinges
concealed
like
those
of
a
modern
safe
was
the
famous
steel
door
we
did
not
wish
to
appear
to
be
too
interested
yet
a
certain
amount
of
curiosity
was
only
proper
my
friend
paused
on
the
steps
turned
and
came
back
you
perfectly
safe
he
smiled
tapping
the
door
with
his
cane
with
a
sort
of
affectionate
respect
it
would
take
the
police
ages
to
get
past
that
barrier
which
would
be
swung
shut
and
bolted
the
moment
the
lookout
gave
the
alarm
but
there
has
never
been
any
trouble
the
police
know
that
it
is
so
far
no
farther
besides
he
added
with
a
wink
to
me
you
know
senator
danfield
would
like
this
pretty
little
door
even
scratched
come
up
i
think
i
hear
delong
voice
heard
of
him
monsieur
it
said
his
luck
has
changed
i
anxious
to
find
quickly
he
led
the
way
up
the
handsome
staircase
and
into
a
large
lofty
richly
furnished
room
everywhere
there
were
thick
heavy
carpets
on
the
floors
into
which
your
feet
sank
with
an
air
of
satisfying
luxury
the
room
into
which
we
entered
was
indeed
absolutely
windowless
it
was
a
room
built
within
the
original
room
of
the
old
house
thus
the
windows
overlooking
the
street
from
the
second
floor
in
reality
bore
no
relation
to
it
for
light
it
depended
on
a
complete
oval
of
lights
overhead
so
arranged
as
to
be
themselves
invisible
but
shining
through
richly
stained
glass
and
conveying
the
illusion
of
a
slightly
clouded
noonday
the
absence
of
windows
was
made
up
for
as
i
learned
later
by
a
ventilating
device
so
perfect
that
although
everyone
was
smoking
a
most
fastidious
person
could
scarcely
have
been
offended
by
the
odour
of
tobacco
of
course
i
did
not
notice
all
this
at
first
what
i
did
notice
however
was
a
and
a
but
as
no
one
was
playing
at
either
my
eye
quickly
travelled
to
a
which
stretched
along
the
middle
of
the
room
some
ten
or
a
dozen
men
in
evening
clothes
were
gathered
watching
with
intent
faces
the
spinning
wheel
there
was
no
money
on
the
table
nothing
but
piles
of
chips
of
various
denominations
another
thing
that
surprised
me
as
i
looked
was
that
the
tense
look
on
the
faces
of
the
players
was
anything
but
the
feverish
haggard
gaze
i
had
expected
in
fact
they
were
sleek
typical
prosperous
rather
inclined
to
the
noticeable
in
dress
and
carrying
their
avoirdupois
as
if
life
was
an
easy
game
with
them
most
of
them
evidently
belonged
to
the
financial
and
society
classes
there
were
no
tragedies
the
tragedies
were
elsewhere
in
their
offices
homes
in
the
courts
anywhere
but
not
here
at
the
club
here
all
was
life
light
and
laughter
for
the
benefit
of
those
not
acquainted
with
the
and
i
may
as
well
confess
that
most
of
my
own
knowledge
was
gained
in
that
one
crowded
evening
i
may
say
that
it
consists
briefly
of
a
wooden
disc
very
nicely
balanced
and
turning
in
the
centre
of
a
cavity
set
into
a
table
like
a
circular
with
an
outer
rim
turned
slightly
inward
the
croupier
revolves
the
wheel
to
the
right
with
a
quick
motion
of
his
middle
finger
he
flicks
a
marble
usually
of
ivory
to
the
left
at
the
vesper
club
always
the
ball
was
of
platinum
not
of
ivory
the
disc
with
its
sloping
sides
is
provided
with
a
number
of
brass
rods
some
perpendicular
some
horizontal
as
the
ball
and
the
wheel
lose
momentum
the
ball
strikes
against
the
rods
and
finally
is
deflected
into
one
of
the
many
little
pockets
or
stalls
facing
the
rim
of
the
wheel
there
are
of
these
pockets
two
are
marked
and
the
others
numbered
from
one
to
in
an
irregular
and
confusing
order
and
painted
alternately
red
and
black
at
each
end
of
the
table
are
large
squares
correspondingly
numbered
and
coloured
the
and
are
of
a
neutral
colour
whenever
the
ball
falls
in
the
or
the
bank
takes
the
stakes
or
sweeps
the
the
board
the
monte
carlo
wheel
has
only
one
while
the
typical
american
has
two
and
the
chinese
has
four
to
one
like
myself
who
had
read
of
the
continental
with
the
clink
of
gold
pieces
on
the
table
and
the
croupier
with
his
wooden
rake
noisily
raking
in
the
winnings
of
the
bank
the
comparative
silence
of
the
american
game
comes
as
a
surprise
as
we
advanced
we
heard
only
the
rattle
of
the
ball
the
click
of
the
chips
and
the
monotonous
tone
of
the
spinner
black
eight
red
seventeen
it
was
almost
like
the
boys
in
a
office
calling
off
the
quotations
of
the
ticker
and
marking
them
up
on
the
board
leaning
forward
almost
oblivious
to
the
rest
was
percival
delong
a
tall
lithe
handsome
young
man
whose
boyish
face
ill
comported
with
the
marks
of
dissipation
clearly
outlined
on
it
such
a
boy
it
flashed
across
my
mind
ought
to
be
studying
the
possible
plays
of
football
of
an
evening
in
the
after
his
dinner
at
the
rather
than
the
possible
gyrations
of
the
little
platinum
ball
on
the
wheel
curse
the
luck
he
exclaimed
as
appeared
again
a
hebrew
banker
staked
a
pile
of
chips
on
the
to
come
up
a
third
time
a
murmur
of
applause
at
his
nerve
ran
through
the
circle
delong
hesitated
as
one
who
thought
seventeen
has
come
out
twice
the
odds
against
its
coming
again
are
too
great
even
though
the
winnings
would
be
fabulous
for
a
good
he
placed
his
next
bet
on
another
number
he
playing
lord
rosslyn
system
whispered
my
friend
the
wheel
spun
the
ball
rolled
and
the
croupier
called
again
seventeen
a
tremor
of
excitement
ran
through
the
crowd
it
was
almost
unprecedented
delong
with
a
stifled
oath
leaned
back
and
scanned
the
faces
about
the
table
and
has
precisely
the
same
chance
of
turning
up
in
the
next
spin
as
if
it
had
not
already
had
a
run
of
three
said
a
voice
at
my
elbow
it
was
kennedy
the
needs
no
introduction
when
curious
sequences
are
afoot
all
are
friends
that
the
theory
of
sir
hiram
maxim
commented
my
friend
as
he
excused
himself
reluctantly
for
another
appointment
but
no
true
gambler
will
believe
it
monsieur
or
at
least
act
on
all
eyes
were
turned
on
kennedy
who
made
a
gesture
of
polite
deprecation
as
if
the
remark
of
my
friend
were
true
but
he
nonchalantly
placed
his
chips
on
the
the
odds
against
appearing
four
consecutive
times
are
some
millions
he
went
on
and
yet
having
appeared
three
times
it
is
just
as
likely
to
appear
again
as
before
it
is
the
usual
practice
to
avoid
a
number
that
has
had
a
run
on
the
theory
that
some
other
number
is
more
likely
to
come
up
than
it
is
that
would
be
the
case
if
it
were
drawing
balls
from
a
bag
full
of
red
and
black
balls
the
more
red
ones
drawn
the
smaller
the
chance
of
drawing
another
red
one
but
if
the
balls
are
put
back
in
the
bag
after
being
drawn
the
chances
of
drawing
a
red
one
after
three
have
been
drawn
are
exactly
the
same
as
ever
if
we
toss
a
cent
and
heads
appear
twelve
times
that
does
not
have
the
slightest
effect
on
the
thirteenth
toss
there
is
still
an
even
chance
that
it
too
will
be
heads
so
if
had
come
up
five
times
it
would
be
just
as
likely
to
come
the
sixth
as
if
the
previous
five
had
not
occurred
and
that
despite
the
fact
that
before
it
has
appeared
at
all
odds
against
a
run
of
the
same
number
six
times
in
succession
are
about
two
billion
four
hundred
and
million
and
some
thousands
most
systems
are
based
on
the
old
persistent
belief
that
occurrences
of
chance
are
affected
in
some
way
by
occurrences
immediately
preceding
but
disconnected
physically
if
we
had
a
run
of
black
for
twenty
times
system
says
play
the
red
for
the
but
black
is
just
as
likely
to
turn
up
the
as
if
it
were
the
first
play
of
all
the
confusion
arises
because
a
run
of
twenty
on
the
black
should
happen
once
in
one
million
thousand
five
hundred
and
coups
it
would
take
ten
years
to
make
that
many
coups
and
the
run
of
twenty
might
occur
once
or
any
number
of
times
in
it
it
is
only
when
one
deals
with
infinitely
large
numbers
of
coups
that
one
can
count
on
infinitely
small
variations
in
the
mathematical
results
this
game
does
not
go
on
for
infinity
therefore
anything
everything
may
happen
systems
are
based
on
the
infinite
we
play
in
the
you
talk
like
a
professor
i
had
at
the
university
ejaculated
delong
contemptuously
as
craig
finished
his
disquisition
on
the
practical
fallibility
of
theoretically
infallible
systems
again
delong
carefully
avoided
the
as
well
as
the
black
the
wheel
spun
again
the
ball
rolled
the
knot
of
spectators
around
the
table
watched
with
bated
breath
seventeen
won
as
kennedy
piled
up
his
winnings
superciliously
without
even
the
appearance
of
triumph
a
man
behind
me
whispered
a
foreign
nobleman
with
a
system
watch
non
monsieur
said
kennedy
quickly
having
overheard
the
remark
no
system
sir
there
is
only
one
system
of
which
i
what
asked
delong
eagerly
kennedy
staked
a
large
sum
on
the
red
to
win
the
black
came
up
and
he
lost
he
doubled
the
stake
and
played
again
and
again
lost
with
amazing
calmness
craig
kept
right
on
doubling
the
martingale
i
heard
the
man
whisper
behind
me
in
other
words
double
or
kennedy
was
now
in
for
some
hundreds
a
sum
that
was
sufficiently
large
for
him
but
he
doubled
again
still
cheerfully
playing
the
red
and
the
red
won
as
he
gathered
up
his
chips
he
rose
that
the
only
system
he
said
simply
but
go
on
go
on
came
the
chorus
from
about
the
table
no
said
kennedy
quietly
that
is
part
of
the
system
too
to
quit
when
you
have
won
back
your
stakes
and
a
little
huh
exclaimed
delong
in
disgust
suppose
you
were
in
for
some
thousands
you
would
quit
if
you
had
real
sporting
blood
you
would
quit
anyhow
kennedy
calmly
passed
over
the
open
insult
letting
it
be
understood
that
he
ignored
this
beardless
youth
there
is
no
way
you
can
beat
the
game
in
the
long
run
if
you
keep
at
it
he
answered
simply
it
is
mathematically
impossible
consider
we
are
croesuses
we
hire
players
to
stake
money
for
us
on
every
possible
number
at
every
coup
how
do
we
come
out
if
there
are
no
or
we
come
out
after
each
coup
precisely
where
we
started
we
are
paying
our
own
money
back
and
forth
among
ourselves
we
have
neither
more
nor
less
but
with
the
and
the
bank
sweeps
the
board
every
so
often
it
is
only
a
question
of
time
when
after
paying
our
money
back
and
forth
among
ourselves
it
has
all
filtered
through
the
and
into
the
bank
it
is
not
a
game
of
chance
for
the
bank
ah
it
is
exact
mathematical
une
question
d
arithmetique
seulement
pas
messieurs
perhaps
admitted
delong
but
it
does
explain
why
i
am
losing
while
everyone
else
is
we
are
not
winning
persisted
craig
after
i
have
had
a
bite
to
eat
i
will
demonstrate
how
to
lose
by
keeping
on
he
led
the
way
to
the
cafe
delong
was
too
intent
on
the
game
to
leave
even
for
refreshments
now
and
then
i
saw
him
beckon
to
an
attendant
who
brought
him
a
stiff
drink
of
whiskey
for
a
moment
his
play
seemed
a
little
better
then
he
would
drop
back
into
his
hopeless
losing
for
some
reason
or
other
his
system
failed
absolutely
you
see
he
is
hopeless
mused
kennedy
over
our
light
repast
and
yet
of
all
gambling
games
roulette
offers
the
player
the
best
odds
far
better
than
for
instance
our
method
has
usually
been
to
outlaw
roulette
and
permit
horse
racing
in
other
words
suppress
the
more
favourable
and
permit
the
less
favourable
however
we
doing
better
now
we
suppressing
both
of
course
what
i
say
applies
only
to
roulette
when
it
is
honestly
played
delong
would
lose
anyhow
i
i
started
at
kennedy
tone
and
whispered
hastily
what
do
you
mean
do
you
think
the
wheel
is
crooked
i
have
a
doubt
of
it
he
replied
in
an
undertone
that
run
of
might
happen
yes
but
it
is
improbable
they
let
me
win
because
i
was
a
new
player
new
players
always
win
at
first
it
is
proverbial
but
the
man
who
is
running
this
game
has
made
it
look
like
a
platitude
to
satisfy
myself
on
that
point
i
am
going
to
play
again
until
i
have
lost
my
winnings
and
am
just
square
with
the
game
when
i
reach
the
point
that
i
am
convinced
that
some
crooked
work
is
going
on
i
am
going
to
try
a
little
experiment
walter
i
want
you
to
stand
close
to
me
so
that
no
one
can
see
what
i
am
doing
do
just
as
i
will
indicate
to
the
was
now
fast
filling
up
with
the
first
of
the
theatre
crowd
delong
table
was
the
centre
of
attraction
owing
to
the
high
play
a
group
of
young
men
of
his
set
were
commiserating
with
him
on
his
luck
and
discussing
it
with
the
finished
air
of
roues
of
double
their
ages
he
was
doggedly
following
his
system
kennedy
and
i
approached
ah
here
is
the
philosophical
stranger
again
delong
exclaimed
catching
sight
of
kennedy
perhaps
he
can
enlighten
us
on
how
to
win
at
roulette
by
playing
his
own
au
contrarie
monsieur
let
me
demonstrate
how
to
lose
answered
craig
with
a
smile
that
showed
a
row
of
faultless
teeth
beneath
his
black
moustache
decidedly
foreign
kennedy
played
and
lost
and
lost
again
then
he
won
but
in
the
main
he
lost
after
one
particularly
large
loss
i
felt
his
arm
on
mine
drawing
me
closely
to
him
delong
had
taken
a
sort
of
grim
pleasure
in
the
fact
that
kennedy
too
was
losing
i
found
that
craig
had
paused
in
his
play
at
a
moment
when
delong
had
staked
a
large
sum
that
a
number
below
would
turn
up
for
five
plays
the
numbers
had
been
between
and
curious
to
see
what
craig
was
doing
i
looked
cautiously
down
between
us
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
wheel
kennedy
was
holding
an
ordinary
compass
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
the
needle
pointed
at
me
as
i
happened
to
be
standing
north
of
it
the
wheel
spun
suddenly
the
needle
swung
around
to
a
point
between
the
north
and
south
poles
quivered
a
moment
and
came
to
rest
in
that
position
then
it
swung
back
to
the
north
it
was
some
seconds
before
i
realised
the
significance
of
it
it
had
pointed
at
the
table
and
delong
had
lost
again
there
was
some
electric
attachment
at
work
kennedy
and
i
exchanged
glances
and
he
shoved
the
compass
into
my
hand
quickly
you
watch
it
walter
while
i
play
he
whispered
carefully
concealing
it
as
he
had
done
yet
holding
it
as
close
to
the
table
as
i
dared
i
tried
to
follow
two
things
at
once
without
betraying
myself
as
near
as
i
could
make
out
something
happened
at
every
play
i
would
not
go
so
far
as
to
assert
that
whenever
the
larger
stakes
were
on
a
certain
number
the
needle
pointed
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
wheel
for
it
was
impossible
to
be
at
all
accurate
about
it
once
i
noticed
the
needle
did
not
move
at
all
and
he
won
but
at
the
next
play
he
staked
what
i
knew
must
be
the
remainder
of
his
winnings
on
what
seemed
a
very
good
chance
even
before
the
wheel
was
revolved
and
the
ball
set
rolling
the
needle
swung
about
and
when
the
platinum
ball
came
to
rest
kennedy
rose
from
the
table
a
loser
by
george
though
exclaimed
delong
grasping
his
hand
i
take
it
all
back
you
are
a
good
loser
sir
i
wish
i
could
take
it
as
well
as
you
do
but
then
i
in
too
deeply
there
are
too
many
with
the
house
up
against
senator
danfield
had
just
come
in
to
see
how
things
were
going
he
was
a
sleek
fat
man
and
it
was
amazing
to
see
with
what
deference
his
victims
treated
him
he
affected
not
to
have
heard
what
delong
said
but
i
could
imagine
what
he
was
thinking
for
i
had
heard
that
he
had
scant
sympathy
with
anyone
after
he
went
broke
another
evidence
of
the
camaraderie
and
that
surrounded
the
game
kennedy
next
remark
surprised
me
oh
your
luck
will
change
everyone
referred
to
him
as
d
for
have
an
aversion
for
real
names
and
greatly
prefer
initials
your
luck
will
change
presently
keep
right
on
with
your
system
it
the
best
you
can
do
short
of
i
never
quit
replied
the
young
man
under
his
breath
meanwhile
kennedy
and
i
paused
on
the
way
out
to
compare
notes
my
report
of
the
behaviour
of
the
compass
only
confirmed
him
in
his
opinion
as
we
turned
to
the
stairs
we
took
in
a
full
view
of
the
room
a
was
purchasing
senator
danfield
a
new
every
hour
at
the
expense
of
the
players
another
group
was
gathered
about
the
hazard
board
deriving
evident
excitement
though
i
am
sure
none
could
have
given
an
intelligent
account
of
the
chances
they
were
taking
two
were
now
going
full
blast
the
larger
crowd
still
about
delong
snatches
of
conversation
came
to
us
now
and
then
and
i
caught
one
sentence
de
long
in
for
over
a
hundred
thousand
now
on
the
week
play
i
understand
poor
boy
that
about
cleans
him
the
tragedy
of
it
craig
i
whispered
but
he
did
not
hear
with
his
hat
tilted
at
a
rakish
angle
and
his
over
his
arm
he
sauntered
over
for
a
last
look
any
luck
yet
he
asked
carelessly
the
devil
no
returned
the
boy
do
you
know
what
my
advice
to
you
is
the
advice
of
a
man
who
has
seen
high
play
everywhere
from
monte
carlo
to
shanghai
what
play
until
your
luck
changes
if
it
takes
until
a
supercilious
smile
crossed
senator
danfield
fat
face
i
intend
to
and
the
haggard
young
face
turned
again
to
the
table
and
forgot
us
for
heaven
sake
kennedy
i
gasped
as
we
went
down
the
stairway
what
do
you
mean
by
giving
him
such
advice
you
not
so
loud
walter
he
have
done
it
anyhow
i
suppose
but
i
want
him
to
keep
at
it
this
night
means
life
or
death
to
percival
delong
and
his
mother
too
come
on
let
get
out
of
we
passed
the
formidable
steel
door
and
gained
the
street
jostled
by
the
who
had
left
the
restaurants
for
a
few
moments
of
play
at
the
famous
club
that
so
long
had
defied
the
police
almost
gaily
kennedy
swung
along
toward
broadway
at
the
corner
he
hesitated
glanced
up
and
down
caught
sight
of
the
in
the
middle
of
the
next
block
the
driver
was
tugging
at
the
harness
of
the
horses
apparently
fixing
it
we
walked
along
and
stopped
beside
it
drive
around
in
front
of
the
vesper
club
slowly
said
kennedy
as
the
driver
at
last
looked
up
the
van
lumbered
ahead
and
we
followed
it
casually
around
the
corner
it
turned
we
turned
also
my
heart
was
going
like
a
sledgehammer
as
the
critical
moment
approached
my
head
was
in
a
whirl
what
would
that
gay
throng
back
of
those
darkened
windows
down
the
street
think
if
they
knew
what
was
being
prepared
for
them
on
like
the
trojan
horse
the
van
lumbered
a
man
went
into
the
vesper
club
and
i
saw
the
negro
at
the
door
eye
the
oncoming
van
suspiciously
the
door
banged
shut
the
next
thing
i
knew
kennedy
had
ripped
off
his
disguise
had
flung
himself
up
behind
the
van
and
had
swung
the
doors
open
a
dozen
men
with
ages
and
swarmed
out
and
up
the
steps
of
the
club
call
the
reserves
cried
kennedy
watch
the
roof
and
the
back
the
driver
of
the
van
hastened
to
send
in
the
call
the
sharp
raps
of
the
hammers
and
the
axes
sounded
on
the
thick
oak
of
the
outside
door
in
quick
succession
there
was
a
scurry
of
feet
inside
and
we
could
hear
a
grating
noise
and
a
terrific
jar
as
the
inner
steel
door
shut
a
raid
a
raid
on
the
vesper
club
shouted
a
belated
the
crowd
swarmed
around
from
broadway
as
if
it
were
noon
instead
of
midnight
banging
and
ripping
and
tearing
the
outer
door
was
slowly
forced
as
it
crashed
in
the
quick
gongs
of
several
police
patrols
sounded
the
reserves
had
been
called
out
at
the
proper
moment
too
late
for
them
to
tip
off
the
club
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
raid
as
frequently
occurs
disregarding
the
melee
behind
me
i
leaped
through
the
wreckage
with
the
other
raiders
the
steel
door
barred
all
further
progress
with
its
cold
blue
impassibility
how
were
we
to
surmount
this
last
and
most
formidable
barrier
i
turned
in
time
to
see
kennedy
and
hurrying
up
the
steps
with
a
huge
tank
studded
with
bolts
like
a
boiler
while
two
other
men
carried
a
second
tank
there
ordered
craig
set
the
oxygen
there
as
he
placed
his
own
tank
on
the
opposite
side
out
of
the
tanks
stout
tubes
led
with
stopcocks
and
gages
at
the
top
from
a
case
under
his
arm
kennedy
produced
a
curious
arrangement
like
a
huge
hook
with
a
curved
neck
and
a
sharp
beak
really
it
consisted
of
two
metal
tubes
which
ran
into
a
sort
of
cylinder
or
mixing
chamber
above
the
nozzle
while
parallel
to
them
ran
a
third
separate
tube
with
a
second
nozzle
of
its
own
quickly
he
joined
the
ends
of
the
tubes
from
the
tanks
to
the
metal
hook
the
being
joined
to
two
of
the
tubes
of
the
hook
and
the
second
tank
being
joined
to
the
other
with
a
match
he
touched
the
nozzle
gingerly
instantly
a
hissing
spitting
noise
followed
and
an
intense
blinding
needle
of
flame
now
for
the
blowpipe
cried
kennedy
as
he
advanced
toward
the
steel
door
we
make
short
work
of
almost
as
he
said
it
the
steel
beneath
the
blowpipe
became
incandescent
just
to
test
it
he
cut
off
the
head
of
a
steel
rivet
taking
about
a
quarter
of
a
minute
to
do
it
it
was
evident
though
that
that
would
not
weaken
the
door
appreciably
even
if
the
rivets
were
all
driven
through
still
they
gave
a
for
the
flame
of
the
acetylene
torch
it
was
a
brilliant
sight
the
terrific
heat
from
the
first
nozzle
caused
the
metal
to
glow
under
the
torch
as
if
in
an
furnace
from
the
second
nozzle
issued
a
stream
of
oxygen
under
which
the
hot
metal
of
the
door
was
completely
consumed
the
force
of
the
blast
as
the
compressed
oxygen
and
acetylene
were
expelled
carried
a
fine
spray
of
the
disintegrated
metal
visibly
before
it
and
yet
it
was
not
a
big
hole
that
it
made
scarcely
an
eighth
of
an
inch
wide
but
clear
and
sharp
as
if
a
were
eating
its
way
through
a
plank
of
white
pine
with
tense
muscles
kennedy
held
this
terrific
engine
of
destruction
and
moved
it
as
easily
as
if
it
had
been
a
mere
pencil
of
light
he
was
easily
the
calmest
of
us
all
as
we
crowded
about
him
at
a
respectful
distance
acetylene
as
you
may
know
he
hastily
explained
never
pausing
for
a
moment
in
his
work
is
composed
of
carbon
and
hydrogen
as
it
burns
at
the
end
of
the
nozzle
it
is
broken
into
carbon
and
hydrogen
the
carbon
gives
the
high
temperature
and
the
hydrogen
forms
a
cone
that
protects
the
end
of
the
blowpipe
from
being
itself
burnt
but
is
it
dangerous
i
asked
amazed
at
the
skill
with
which
he
handled
the
blowpipe
not
particularly
when
you
know
how
to
do
it
in
that
tank
is
a
porous
asbestos
packing
saturated
with
acetone
under
pressure
thus
i
can
carry
acetylene
safely
for
it
is
dissolved
and
the
possibility
of
explosion
is
minimised
this
mixing
chamber
by
which
i
am
holding
the
torch
where
the
oxygen
and
acetylene
mix
is
also
designed
in
such
a
way
as
to
prevent
a
the
best
thing
about
this
style
of
blowpipe
is
the
ease
with
which
it
can
be
transported
and
the
curious
uses
like
the
present
to
which
it
can
be
he
paused
a
moment
to
test
the
door
all
was
silence
on
the
other
side
the
door
itself
was
as
firm
as
ever
huh
exclaimed
one
of
the
detectives
behind
me
these
things
ai
all
they
cracked
up
to
be
now
if
i
was
runnin
this
show
i
dynamite
that
door
to
kingdom
and
wreck
the
house
and
kill
a
few
people
i
returned
hotly
resenting
the
criticism
of
kennedy
kennedy
affected
not
to
hear
when
i
shut
off
the
oxygen
in
this
second
jet
he
resumed
as
if
nothing
had
been
said
you
see
the
torch
merely
heats
the
steel
i
can
get
a
heat
of
approximately
hundred
degrees
fahrenheit
and
the
flame
will
exert
a
pressure
of
fifty
pounds
to
the
square
wonderful
exclaimed
who
had
not
heard
the
remark
of
his
subordinate
and
was
watching
with
undisguised
admiration
kennedy
how
did
you
ever
think
of
such
a
thing
why
it
used
for
welding
you
know
answered
craig
as
he
continued
to
work
calmly
in
the
growing
excitement
i
first
saw
it
in
actual
use
in
mending
a
cracked
cylinder
in
an
automobile
the
cylinder
was
repaired
without
being
taken
out
at
all
i
seen
it
weld
new
teeth
and
build
up
old
worn
teeth
on
gearing
as
good
as
he
paused
to
let
us
see
the
terrifically
heated
metal
under
the
flame
you
remember
when
we
were
talking
on
the
drive
about
the
raid
a
of
went
by
on
the
railroad
below
us
they
use
this
blowpipe
to
cut
it
up
frequently
that
what
gave
me
the
idea
see
i
turn
on
the
oxygen
now
in
this
second
nozzle
the
blowpipe
is
no
longer
an
instrument
for
joining
metals
together
but
for
cutting
them
asunder
the
steel
burns
just
as
you
perhaps
have
seen
a
burn
in
a
jar
of
oxygen
steel
hard
or
soft
tempered
annealed
chrome
or
harveyised
it
all
burns
just
as
fast
and
just
as
easily
and
it
cheap
too
this
raid
may
cost
a
couple
of
dollars
as
far
as
the
blowpipe
is
concerned
quite
a
difference
from
the
thousands
of
dollars
loss
that
would
follow
an
attempt
to
blow
the
door
the
last
remark
was
directed
quietly
at
the
doubting
detective
he
had
nothing
to
say
we
stood
in
amazement
as
the
torch
slowly
inexorably
traced
a
thin
line
along
the
edge
of
the
door
minute
after
minute
sped
by
as
the
line
burned
by
the
blowpipe
cut
straight
from
top
to
bottom
it
seemed
hours
to
me
was
kennedy
going
to
slit
the
whole
door
and
let
it
fall
in
with
a
crash
no
i
could
see
that
even
in
his
cursory
examination
of
the
door
he
had
gained
a
pretty
good
knowledge
of
the
location
of
the
bolts
imbedded
in
the
steel
one
after
another
he
was
cutting
clear
through
and
severing
them
as
if
with
a
superhuman
knife
what
was
going
on
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
i
wondered
i
could
scarcely
imagine
the
consternation
of
the
gamblers
caught
in
their
own
trap
with
a
quick
motion
kennedy
turned
off
the
acetylene
and
oxygen
the
last
bolt
had
been
severed
a
gentle
push
of
the
hand
and
he
swung
the
once
impregnable
door
on
its
delicately
poised
hinges
as
easily
as
if
he
had
merely
said
open
the
robbers
cave
yawned
before
us
we
made
a
rush
up
the
stairs
kennedy
was
first
next
and
myself
scarcely
a
step
behind
with
the
rest
of
men
at
our
heels
i
think
we
were
all
prepared
for
some
sort
of
for
the
crooks
were
desperate
characters
and
i
myself
was
surprised
to
encounter
nothing
but
physical
force
which
was
quickly
overcome
in
the
now
disordered
richness
of
the
rooms
waving
his
john
doe
warrants
in
one
hand
and
his
pistol
in
the
other
shouted
you
all
under
arrest
gentlemen
if
you
resist
further
it
will
go
hard
with
crowded
now
in
one
end
of
the
room
in
speechless
amazement
was
the
late
gay
party
of
gamblers
including
senator
danfield
himself
they
had
reckoned
on
toying
with
any
chance
but
this
the
pale
white
face
of
delong
among
them
was
like
a
spectre
as
he
stood
staring
blankly
about
and
still
insanely
twisting
the
roulette
wheel
before
him
kennedy
advanced
toward
the
table
with
an
ax
which
he
had
seized
from
one
of
our
men
a
blow
shattered
the
mechanism
of
the
delicate
wheel
delong
he
said
i
not
going
to
talk
to
you
like
your
old
professor
at
the
university
nor
like
your
recent
friend
the
frenchman
with
a
system
this
is
what
you
have
been
up
against
my
boy
his
forefinger
indicated
an
ingenious
but
now
tangled
and
twisted
series
of
minute
wires
and
in
the
broken
wheel
before
us
delicate
brushes
led
the
current
into
the
wheel
with
another
blow
of
his
axe
craig
disclosed
wires
running
down
through
the
leg
of
the
table
to
the
floor
and
under
the
carpet
to
buttons
operated
by
the
man
who
ran
the
game
wh
what
does
it
mean
asked
delong
blankly
it
means
that
you
had
little
enough
chance
to
win
at
a
straight
game
of
roulette
but
the
wheel
is
very
rarely
straight
even
with
all
the
odds
in
favour
of
the
bank
as
they
are
this
game
was
electrically
controlled
others
are
mechanically
controlled
by
what
is
sometimes
called
the
ear
and
other
devices
you
ca
win
these
wires
and
magnets
can
be
made
to
attract
the
little
ball
into
any
pocket
the
operator
desires
each
one
of
those
pockets
contains
a
little
one
set
of
magnets
in
the
red
pockets
is
connected
with
one
button
under
the
carpet
and
a
battery
the
other
set
in
the
black
pockets
is
connected
with
another
button
and
the
battery
this
ball
is
not
really
of
platinum
platinum
is
nonmagnetic
it
is
simply
a
soft
iron
hollow
ball
plated
with
platinum
whichever
set
of
is
energised
attracts
the
ball
and
by
this
simple
method
it
is
in
the
power
of
the
operator
to
let
the
ball
go
to
red
or
black
as
he
may
wish
other
similar
arrangements
control
the
odd
or
even
and
other
combinations
from
other
push
buttons
a
special
arrangement
took
care
of
that
freak
there
is
an
honest
in
the
whole
place
i
might
almost
say
the
whole
city
the
whole
thing
is
crooked
from
start
to
finish
the
men
the
machines
the
that
machine
could
be
made
to
beat
me
by
turning
up
a
run
of
any
number
of
times
or
red
or
black
or
odd
or
even
over
or
under
or
anything
anything
and
i
never
had
a
chance
he
repeated
meditatively
fingering
the
wires
they
broke
me
danfield
delong
turned
looking
dazedly
about
in
the
crowd
for
his
former
friend
then
his
hand
shot
into
his
pocket
and
a
little
pistol
flashed
out
danfield
your
blood
is
on
your
own
head
you
have
ruined
kennedy
must
have
been
expecting
something
of
the
sort
for
he
seized
the
arm
of
the
young
man
weakened
by
dissipation
and
turned
the
pistol
upward
as
if
it
had
been
in
the
grasp
of
a
mere
child
a
blinding
flash
followed
in
the
farthest
corner
of
the
room
and
a
huge
puff
of
smoke
before
i
could
collect
my
wits
another
followed
in
the
opposite
corner
the
room
was
filled
with
a
dense
smoke
two
men
were
scuffing
at
my
feet
one
was
kennedy
as
i
dropped
down
quickly
to
help
him
i
saw
that
the
other
was
danfield
his
face
purple
with
the
violence
of
the
struggle
do
be
alarmed
gentlemen
i
heard
shout
the
explosions
were
only
the
flashlights
of
the
official
police
photographers
we
now
have
the
evidence
complete
gentlemen
you
will
now
go
down
quietly
to
the
below
two
by
two
if
you
have
anything
to
say
say
it
to
the
magistrate
of
the
night
hold
his
arms
walter
panted
kennedy
i
did
with
a
dexterity
that
would
have
done
credit
to
a
pickpocket
kennedy
reached
into
danfield
pocket
and
pulled
out
some
papers
before
the
smoke
had
cleared
and
order
had
been
restored
craig
exclaimed
let
him
up
walter
here
delong
here
are
the
against
you
tear
them
up
they
are
not
even
a
debt
of
honour
