preface
reader
i
beseech
you
not
to
throw
down
this
volume
as
soon
as
you
have
glanced
at
the
title
read
it
if
your
prejudices
will
allow
for
the
very
truth
sake
if
i
have
the
most
trifling
claims
upon
your
good
will
for
an
hour
amusement
to
yourself
or
benefit
to
your
children
read
it
for
sake
read
it
if
it
be
merely
to
find
fresh
occasion
to
sneer
at
the
vulgarity
of
the
cause
read
it
from
sheer
curiosity
to
see
what
a
woman
who
had
much
better
attend
to
her
household
concerns
will
say
upon
such
a
subject
read
it
on
any
terms
and
my
purpose
will
be
gained
the
subject
i
have
chosen
admits
of
no
encomiums
on
my
country
but
as
i
generally
make
it
an
object
to
supply
what
is
most
needed
this
circumstance
is
unimportant
the
market
is
so
glutted
with
flattery
that
a
little
truth
may
be
acceptable
were
it
only
for
its
rarity
i
am
fully
aware
of
the
unpopularity
of
the
task
i
have
undertaken
but
though
i
ridicule
and
censure
it
is
not
in
my
nature
to
them
a
few
years
hence
the
opinion
of
the
world
will
be
a
matter
in
which
i
have
not
even
the
most
transient
interest
but
this
book
will
be
abroad
on
its
mission
of
humanity
long
after
the
hand
that
wrote
it
is
mingling
with
the
dust
should
it
be
the
means
of
advancing
even

while
the
portuguese
were
exploring
africa
in
prince
henry
ordered
anthony
gonsalez
to
carry
back
certain
moorish
prisoners
whom
he
had
seized
two
years
before
near
cape
bajador
this
order
was
obeyed
and
gonsalez
received
from
the
moors
in
exchange
for
the
captives
ten
negroes
and
a
quantity
of
gold
dust
unluckily
this
wicked
speculation
proved
profitable
and
other
portuguese
were
induced
to
embark
in
it
in
the
west
india
islands
were
discovered
by
columbus
the
spaniards
dazzled
with
the
acquisition
of
a
new
world
and
eager
to
come
into
possession
of
their
wealth
compelled
the
natives
of
hispaniola
to
dig
in
the
mines
the
native
indians
died
rapidly
in
consequence
of
hard
work
and
cruel
treatment
and
thus
a
new
market
was
opened
for
the
negro
slaves
captured
by
the
portuguese
they
were
accordingly
introduced
as
early
as
those
who
bought
and
those
who
sold
were
alike
prepared
to
trample
on
the
rights
of
their
by
that
most
demoralizing
of
all
influences
the
accursed
love
of
gold
cardinal
ximenes
while
he
administered
the
government
before
the
accession
of
charles
the
fifth
was
petitioned
to
allow
a
regular
commerce
in
african
negroes
but
he
rejected
the
proposal
with
promptitude
and
firmness
alike
honorable
to
his
head
and
heart
this
earliest
friend
of
the
africans
living
in
a
comparatively
unenlightened
age
has
peculiar
claims
upon
our
gratitude
and
reverence
in
charles
the
fifth
granted
a
patent
for
an
annual
supply
of
four
thousand
negroes
to
the
spanish
islands
he
probably
soon
became
aware
of
the
horrible
and
evils
attendant
upon
this
traffic
for
years
after
he
emancipated
every
negro
in
his
dominions
but
when
he
resigned
his
crown
and
retired
to
a
monastery
the
colonists
resumed
their
shameless
tyranny
captain
hawkins
afterward
sir
john
hawkins
was
the
first
englishman
who
disgraced
himself
and
his
country
by
this
abominable
trade
assisted
by
some
rich
people
in
london
he
fitted
out
three
ships
and
sailed
to
the
african
coast
where
he
burned
and
plundered
the
towns
and
carried
off
three
hundred
of
the
defenceless
inhabitants
to
hispaniola
elizabeth
afterwards
authorized
a
similar
adventure
with
one
of
her
own
vessels
she
expressed
her
concern
lest
any
of
the
africans
should
be
carried
off
without
their
free
consent
declaring
that
such
a
thing
would
be
detestable
and
call
down
the
vengeance
of
heaven
upon
the
undertakers
for
this
reason
it
has
been
supposed
that
the
queen
was
deceived
that
she
imagined
the
negroes
were
transported
to
the
spanish
colonies
as
voluntary
laborers
but
history
gives
us
slight
reasons
to
judge
elizabeth
so
favorably
it
was
her
system
always
to
preserve
an
of
justice
and
virtue
she
was
a
shrewd
politician
and
had
in
perfection
the
clear
head
and
cold
heart
calculated
to
form
that
character
whatever
she
might
believe
of
the
trade
at
its
beginning
she
was
too
deeply
read
in
human
nature
not
to
foresee
the
inevitable
consequence
of
placing
power
in
the
hands
of
avarice
a
roman
priest
persuaded
louis
the
thirteenth
to
sanction
slavery
for
the
sake
of
converting
the
negroes
to
christianity
and
thus
this
bloody
iniquity
disguised
with
gown
hood
and
rosary
entered
the
fair
dominions
of
france
to
be
violently
wrested
from
his
home
and
condemned
to
toil
without
hope
by
christians
to
whom
he
had
done
no
wrong
was
methinks
a
very
odd
beginning
to
the
poor
negro
course
of
religious
instruction
when
this
evil
had
once
begun
it
of
course
gathered
strength
rapidly
for
all
the
bad
passions
of
human
nature
were
eagerly
enlisted
in
its
cause
the
british
formed
settlements
in
north
america
and
in
the
west
indies
and
these
were
stocked
with
slaves
from
to
million
one
hundred
and
thirty
negroes
were
imported
into
the
british
colonies
in
almost
all
great
evils
there
is
some
redeeming
feature
good
results
even
where
it
is
not
intended
pride
and
vanity
utterly
selfish
and
wrong
in
themselves
often
throw
money
into
the
hands
of
the
poor
and
thus
tend
to
excite
industry
and
ingenuity
while
they
produce
comfort
but
slavery
is
evil
within
and
without
root
and
branch
bud
blossom
and
fruit
in
order
to
show
how
dark
it
is
in
every
aspect
how
invariably
injurious
both
to
nations
and
individuals
i
will
select
a
few
facts
from
the
mass
of
evidence
now
before
me
in
the
first
place
its
effects
upon
have
been
most
disastrous
all
along
the
coast
intercourse
with
europeans
has
deprived
the
inhabitants
of
their
primitive
simplicity
without
substituting
in
its
place
the
order
refinement
and
correctness
of
principle
attendant
upon
true
civilization
the
soil
of
africa
is
rich
in
native
productions
and
honorable
commerce
might
have
been
a
blessing
to
her
to
europe
and
to
america
but
instead
of
that
a
trade
has
been
substituted
which
operates
like
a
withering
curse
upon
all
concerned
in
it
there
are
green
and
sheltered
valleys
in
africa
broad
and
beautiful
rivers
and
vegetation
in
its
loveliest
and
most
magnificent
but
no
comfortable
houses
no
thriving
farms
no
cultivated
gardens
for
it
is
not
safe
to
possess
permanent
property
where
each
little
state
is
surrounded
by
warlike
neighbors
continually
sending
out
their
armed
bands
in
search
of
slaves
the
white
man
offers
his
most
tempting
articles
of
merchandise
to
the
negro
as
a
price
for
the
flesh
and
blood
of
his
enemy
and
if
we
with
all
our
boasted
knowledge
and
religion
are
seduced
by
money
to
do
such
grievous
wrong
to
those
who
have
never
offended
us
what
can
we
expect
of
men
just
emerging
from
the
limited
wants
of
savage
life
too
uncivilized
to
have
formed
any
habits
of
steady
industry
yet
earnestly
coveting
the
productions
they
know
not
how
to
earn
the
inevitable
consequence
is
that
war
is
made
throughout
that
unhappy
continent
not
only
upon
the
slightest
pretences
but
often
without
any
pretext
at
all
villages
are
set
on
fire
and
those
who
fly
from
the
flames
rush
upon
the
spears
of
the
enemy
private
kidnapping
is
likewise
carried
on
to
a
great
extent
for
he
who
can
catch
a
neighbor
child
is
sure
to
find
a
ready
purchaser
and
it
sometimes
happens
that
the
captor
and
his
living
merchandise
are
both
seized
by
the
white
houses
are
broken
open
in
the
night
and
defenceless
women
and
children
carried
away
into
captivity
if
boys
in
the
unsuspecting
innocence
of
youth
come
near
the
white
man
ships
to
sell
vegetables
or
fruit
they
are
ruthlessly
seized
and
carried
to
slavery
in
a
distant
land
even
the
laws
are
perverted
to
this
shameful
purpose
if
a
chief
wants
european
commodities
he
accuses
a
parent
of
witchcraft
the
victim
is
tried
by
the
ordeal
of
poisoned
water
a
and
if
he
sicken
at
the
draught
the
king
claims
a
right
to
punish
him
by
selling
his
whole
family
in
african
legislation
almost
all
crimes
are
punished
with
slavery
and
thanks
to
the
white
man
rapacity
there
is
always
a
very
powerful
motive
for
finding
the
culprit
guilty
he
must
be
a
very
good
king
indeed
that
judges
his
subjects
impartially
when
he
is
sure
of
making
money
by
doing
otherwise
footnote
a
judicial
trials
by
the
ordeal
of
personal
combat
in
which
the
vanquished
were
always
pronounced
guilty
occurred
as
late
as
the
sixteenth
century
both
in
france
and
england
the
king
of
dahomy
and
other
despotic
princes
do
not
scruple
to
seize
their
own
people
and
sell
them
without
provocation
whenever
they
happen
to
want
anything
which
can
furnish
if
a
chief
has
conscience
enough
to
object
to
such
proceedings
he
is
excited
by
presents
of
gunpowder
and
brandy
one
of
these
men
who
could
not
resist
the
persuasions
of
the
while
he
was
intoxicated
was
when
he
recovered
his
senses
and
bitterly
reproached
his
seducers
one
negro
king
debarred
by
his
religion
from
the
use
of
spirituous
liquors
and
therefore
less
dangerously
tempted
than
others
abolished
the
throughout
his
dominions
and
exerted
himself
to
encourage
honest
industry
but
his
people
must
have
been
as
sheep
among
wolves
relentless
bigotry
brings
its
aid
to
darken
the
horrors
of
the
scene
the
mohammedans
deem
it
right
to
subject
the
heathen
tribes
to
perpetual
bondage
the
moors
and
arabs
think
alla
and
the
prophet
have
given
them
an
undisputed
right
to
the
poor
caffre
his
wife
his
children
and
his
goods
but
mark
how
the
deepens
even
the
fearful
gloom
of
bigotry
these
mohammedans
are
by
no
means
zealous
to
enlighten
their
pagan
neighbors
they
do
not
wish
them
to
come
to
a
knowledge
of
what
they
consider
the
true
religion
lest
they
should
forfeit
the
only
ground
on
which
they
can
even
pretend
to
the
right
of
driving
them
by
thousands
to
the
markets
of
kano
and
tripoli
this
is
precisely
like
our
own
conduct
we
say
the
negroes
are
so
ignorant
that
they
must
be
slaves
and
we
insist
upon
keeping
them
ignorant
lest
we
spoil
them
for
slaves
the
same
spirit
that
dictates
this
logic
to
the
arab
teaches
it
to
the
european
and
the
american
call
it
what
you
please
it
is
certainly
neither
of
heaven
nor
of
earth
when
the
are
lying
on
the
coast
of
africa
canoes
well
armed
are
sent
into
the
inland
country
and
after
a
few
weeks
they
return
with
hundreds
of
negroes
tied
fast
with
ropes
sometimes
the
white
men
lurk
among
the
bushes
and
seize
the
wretched
beings
who
incautiously
venture
from
their
homes
sometimes
they
paint
their
skins
as
black
as
their
hearts
and
by
this
deception
suddenly
surprise
the
unsuspecting
natives
at
other
times
the
victims
are
decoyed
on
board
the
vessel
under
some
kind
pretence
or
other
and
then
lashed
to
the
mast
or
chained
in
the
hold
is
it
not
very
natural
for
the
africans
to
say
devilish
white
all
along
the
shores
of
this
devoted
country
terror
and
distrust
prevail
the
natives
never
venture
out
without
arms
when
a
vessel
is
in
sight
and
skulk
through
their
own
fields
as
if
watched
by
a
panther
all
their
worst
passions
are
called
into
full
exercise
and
all
their
kindlier
feelings
smothered
treachery
fraud
and
violence
desolate
the
country
rend
asunder
the
dearest
relations
and
pollute
the
very
fountains
of
justice
the
history
of
the
negro
whether
national
or
domestic
is
written
in
blood
had
half
the
skill
and
strength
employed
in
the
been
engaged
in
honorable
commerce
the
native
princes
would
long
ago
have
directed
their
energies
towards
clearing
the
country
destroying
wild
beasts
and
introducing
the
arts
and
refinements
of
civilized
life
under
such
influences
africa
might
become
an
earthly
paradise
the
white
man
avarice
has
made
it
a
den
of
wolves
having
thus
glanced
at
the
miserable
effects
of
this
system
on
the
condition
of
africa
we
will
now
follow
the
poor
through
his
wretched
wanderings
in
order
to
give
some
idea
of
his
physical
suffering
his
mental
and
moral
degradation
husbands
are
torn
from
their
wives
children
from
their
parents
while
the
air
is
filled
with
the
shrieks
and
lamentations
of
the
bereaved
sometimes
they
are
brought
from
a
remote
country
obliged
to
wander
over
mountains
and
through
deserts
chained
together
in
herds
driven
by
the
whip
scorched
by
a
tropical
sun
compelled
to
carry
heavy
bales
of
merchandise
suffering
with
hunger
and
thirst
worn
down
with
fatigue
and
often
leaving
their
bones
to
whiten
in
the
desert
a
large
troop
of
slaves
taken
by
the
sultan
of
fezzan
died
in
the
desert
for
want
of
food
in
some
places
travellers
meet
with
fifty
or
sixty
skeletons
in
a
day
of
which
the
largest
proportion
were
no
doubt
slaves
on
their
way
to
european
markets
sometimes
the
poor
creatures
refuse
to
go
a
step
further
and
even
the
lacerating
whip
can
not
goad
them
on
in
such
cases
they
become
the
prey
of
wild
beasts
more
merciful
than
white
men
those
who
arrive
at
the
seacoast
are
in
a
state
of
desperation
and
despair
their
purchasers
are
so
well
aware
of
this
and
so
fearful
of
the
consequences
that
they
set
sail
in
the
night
lest
the
negroes
should
know
when
they
depart
from
their
native
shores
and
here
the
scene
becomes
almost
too
harrowing
to
dwell
upon
but
we
must
not
allow
our
nerves
to
be
more
tender
than
our
consciences
the
poor
wretches
are
stowed
by
hundreds
like
bales
of
goods
between
the
low
decks
where
filth
and
putrid
air
produce
disease
madness
and
suicide

the
following
account
is
given
by
walsh
who
accompanied
viscount
strangford
as
chaplain
on
his
embassy
to
brazil
the
vessel
in
which
he
sailed
chased

asked
and
obtained

governments

pirates
such
of
their
subjects
as
are
discovered
carrying
on
this
guilty
trade
north
of
the
equator
doctor
walsh
was
an
eyewitness
of
the
scene
he
describes
and
the
evidence
given
at
various
times
before
the
british
house
of
commons
proves
that
the
frightful
picture
is
by
no
means
exaggerated
the
vessel
had
taken
in
on
the
coast
of
africa
three
hundred
and
males
and
two
hundred
and
females
making
in
all
five
hundred
and
she
had
been
out
seventeen
days
during
which
she
had
thrown
overboard
they
were
all
inclosed
under
grated
hatchways
between
decks
the
space
was
so
low
and
they
were
stowed
so
close
together
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
lying
down
or
changing
their
position
night
or
day
the
greater
part
of
them
were
shut
out
from
light
and
air
and
this
when
the
thermometer
exposed
to
the
open
sky
was
standing
in
the
shade
on
our
deck
at
degrees
the
space
between
decks
was
divided
into
two
compartments
three
feet
three
inches
high
two
hundred
and
women
and
girls
were
thrust
into
one
space
two
hundred
and
feet
square
and
three
hundred
and
men
and
boys
were
crammed
into
another
space
eight
hundred
feet
square
giving
the
whole
an
average
of
inches
and
to
each
of
the
women
not
more
than
thirteen
inches
though
several
of
them
were
in
a
state
of
health
which
peculiarly
demanded
as
they
were
shipped
on
account
of
different
individuals
they
were
branded
like
sheep
with
the
owner
marks
of
different
forms
which
as
the
mate
informed
me
with
perfect
indifference
had
been
burnt
in
with
iron
over
the
hatchway
stood
a
ferocious
looking
fellow
the
of
the
ship
with
a
scourge
of
thongs
in
his
hand
whenever
he
heard
the
slightest
noise
from
below
he
shook
it
over
them
and
seemed
eager
to
exercise
it
as
soon
as
the
poor
creatures
saw
us
looking
down
at
them
their
melancholy
visages
brightened
up
they
perceived
something
of
sympathy
and
kindness
in
our
looks
to
which
they
had
not
been
accustomed
and
feeling
instinctively
that
we
were
friends
they
immediately
began
to
shout
and
clap
their
hands
the
women
were
particularly
excited
they
all
held
up
their
arms
and
when
we
bent
down
and
shook
hands
with
them
they
could
not
contain
their
delight
they
endeavored
to
scramble
upon
their
knees
stretching
up
to
kiss
our
hands
and
we
understood
they
knew
we
had
come
to
liberate
them
some
however
hung
down
their
heads
in
apparently
hopeless
dejection
some
were
greatly
emaciated
and
some
particularly
children
seemed
dying
the
heat
of
these
horrid
places
was
so
great
and
the
odor
so
offensive
that
it
was
quite
impossible
to
enter
them
even
had
there
been
room
the
officers
insisted
that
the
poor
suffering
creatures
should
be
admitted
on
deck
to
get
air
and
water
this
was
opposed
by
the
mate
of
the
slaver
who
from
a
feeling
that
they
deserved
it
declared
they
should
be
all
murdered
the
officers
however
persisted
and
the
poor
beings
were
all
turned
out
together
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
the
effect
of
this
eruption
five
hundred
and
seventeen
of
all
ages
and
sexes
some
children
some
adults
some
old
men
and
women
all
entirely
destitute
of
clothing
scrambling
out
together
to
taste
the
luxury
of
a
little
fresh
air
and
water
they
came
swarming
up
like
bees
from
a
hive
till
the
whole
deck
was
crowded
to
suffocation
from
stem
to
stern
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
where
they
could
all
have
come
from
or
how
they
could
have
been
stowed
away
on
looking
into
the
places
where
they
had
been
crammed
there
were
found
some
children
next
the
sides
of
the
ship
in
the
places
most
remote
from
light
and
air
they
were
lying
nearly
in
a
torpid
state
after
the
rest
had
turned
out
the
little
creatures
seemed
indifferent
as
to
life
or
death
and
when
they
were
carried
on
deck
many
of
them
could
not
stand
after
enjoying
for
a
short
time
the
unusual
luxury
of
air
some
water
was
brought
it
was
then
that
the
extent
of
their
sufferings
was
exposed
in
a
fearful
manner
they
all
rushed
like
maniacs
towards
it
no
entreaties
or
threats
or
blows
could
restrain
them
they
shrieked
and
struggled
and
fought
with
one
another
for
a
drop
of
this
precious
liquid
as
if
they
grew
rabid
at
the
sight
of
it
there
is
nothing
from
which
slaves
in
the
suffer
so
much
as
want
of
water
it
is
sometimes
usual
to
take
out
casks
filled
with
as
ballast
and
when
the
slaves
are
received
on
board
to
start
the
casks
and
them
with
fresh
on
one
occasion
a
ship
from
bahia
neglected
to
change
the
contents
of
their
casks
and
on
the
found
to
their
horror
that
they
were
filled
with
nothing
but
salt
water
all
the
slaves
on
board
perished
we
could
judge
of
the
extent
of
their
sufferings
from
the
afflicting
sight
we
now
saw
when
the
poor
creatures
were
ordered
down
again
several
of
them
came
and
pressed
their
heads
against
our
knees
with
looks
of
the
greatest
anguish
with
the
prospect
of
returning
to
the
horrid
place
of
suffering
below
alas
the
proved
by
his
papers
that
he
confined
his
traffic
strictly
to
the
south
of
the
line
where
it
was
yet
lawful
perhaps
his
papers
were
forged
but
the
english
officers
were
afraid
to
violate
an
article
of
the
treaty
which
their
government
had
made
with
brazil
thus
does
cunning
wickedness
defeat
benevolence
and
justice
in
this
world
walsh
continues
with
infinite
regret
therefore
we
were
obliged
to
restore
his
papers
to
the
captain
and
permit
him
to
proceed
after
nine
hours
detention
and
close
investigation
it
was
dark
when
we
separated
and
the
last
parting
sounds
we
heard
from
the
unhallowed
ship
were
the
cries
and
shrieks
of
the
slaves
suffering
under
some
bodily
infliction
i
suppose
the
english
officers
acted
politically
right
but
not
for
the
world
wealth
would
i
have
acted
politically
right
under
such
circumstances

notwithstanding

this
horrid
traffic
in
human
flesh
is
nearly
as
extensively
carried
on
as
ever
and
under
circumstances
perhaps
of
a
more
revolting
character
the
very

at

the
desperate
hazard
cause
inconvenience
and
sufferings
to
the
poor
creatures
in
a
very
aggravated
degree
arrived
at
the
place
of
destination
the
condition
of
the
slave
is
scarcely
less
deplorable
they
are
advertised
with
cattle
chained
in
droves
and
driven
to
market
with
a
whip
and
sold
at
auction
with
the
beasts
of
the
field
they
are
treated
like
brutes
and
all
the
influences
around
them
conspire
to
make
them
brutes

without

no

without

in

from
the
moment
the

is
kidnapped
to
the

he
draws
his
miserable
breath
the
white

directly
cherishes
ignorance
fraud

theft
licentiousness
revenge
hatred

murder
it
can
not
be
denied
that

thus
operated
upon
necessarily

more
or

to
all
these
and
thus
do
we
dare
to
treat
beings
who
like
ourselves
are
heirs
of
immortality
and
now
let
us
briefly
inquire
into
the
influence
of
slavery
on
the
character
for
in
this
evil
there
is
a
mighty
such
is
the
constitution
of
things
that
we
can
not
inflict
an
injury
without
suffering
from
it
ourselves
he
who
blesses
another
benefits
himself
but
he
who
sins
against
his
does
his
own
soul
a
grievous
wrong
the
effect
produced
upon
is
absolutely
frightful
those
who
wish
to
realize
it
in
all
its
awful
extent
may
find
abundant
information
in
clarkson
history
of
slavery
the
authenticity
of
the
facts
there
given
can
not
be
doubted
for
setting
aside
the
perfect
honesty
of
clarkson
character
these
facts
were
principally
accepted
as
evidence
before
the
british
parliament
where
there
was
a
very
strong
party
of
desirous
to
prove
them
false
indeed
when
we
reflect
upon
the
subject
it
can
not
excite
surprise
that
become
as
and
fierce
as
tigers
the
very
first
step
in
their
business
is
a
deliberate
invasion
of
the
rights
of
others
its
pursuit
combines
every
form
of
violence
bloodshed
tyranny
and
anguish
they
are
accustomed
to
consider
their
victims
as
cattle
or
blocks
of
wood
c
and
they
are
invested
with
perfectly
despotic
powers
footnote
c
i
have
read
letters
from
to
their
employers
in
which
they
declare
that
they
shipped
such
a
number
of
of
or
of
on
the
coast
of
africa
near
the
office
of
the

this

and
sundry
old
there
is
a
great
waste
of
life
among
white
seamen
employed
in
this
traffic
in
consequence
of
the
severe
punishment
they
receive
and
diseases
originating
in
the
unwholesome
atmosphere
on
board
clarkson
after
a
long
and
patient
investigation
came
to
the
conclusion
that
two
slave
voyages
to
africa
would
destroy
more
seamen
than
to
newfoundland
and
there
is
this
difference
to
be
observed
that
the
loss
in
one
trade
is
generally
occasioned
by
weather
or
accident
in
the
other
by
cruelty
or
disease
the
instances
are
exceedingly
numerous
of
sailors
on
board
that
have
died
under
the
lash
or
in
consequence
of
it
some
of
the
particulars
are
so
painful
that
it
has
made
me
sicken
to
read
them
and
i
therefore
forbear
to
repeat
them
of
the
alexander
crew
in
no
less
than
eleven
deserted
at
bonny
on
the
african
coast
because
life
had
become
insupportable
they
chose
all
that
could
be
endured
from
a
most
inhospitable
climate
and
the
violence
of
the
natives
rather
than
remain
in
their
own
ship
nine
others
died
on
the
voyage
and
the
rest
were
exceedingly
abused
this
state
of
things
was
so
universal
that
seamen
were
notoriously
averse
to
enter
the
hateful
business
in
order
to
obtain
them
it
became
necessary
to
resort
to
force
or
deception
behold
how
many
branches
there
are
to
the
tree
of
crime
decoyed
to
houses
where
night
after
night
was
spent
in
dancing
rioting
and
drunkenness
the
thoughtless
fellows
gave
themselves
up
to
the
merriment
of
the
scene
and
in
a
moment
of
intoxication
the
fatal
bargain
was
sealed
encouraged
to
spend
more
than
they
owned
a
jail
or
the
became
the
only
alternatives
the
superiority
of
wages
was
likewise
a
strong
inducement
but
this
was
a
cheat
the
wages
of
the
sailors
were
half
paid
in
the
currency
of
the
country
where
the
vessel
carried
her
slaves
and
thus
they
were
actually
lower
than
in
other
trades
while
they
were
nominally
higher
in
such
an
employment
the
morals
of
the
seamen
of
course
became
corrupt
like
their
masters
and
every
species
of
fraud
was
thought
allowable
to
deceive
the
ignorant
africans
by
means
of
false
weights
false
measures
adulterated
commodities
and
the
like
of
the
cruelties
on
board
i
will
mention
but
a
few
instances
though
a
large
volume
might
be
filled
with
such
detestable
anecdotes
perfectly
well
authenticated
a
child
on
board
a
of
about
ten
months
old
took
sulk
and
would
not
eat
the
captain
flogged
it
with
a
swearing
that
he
would
make
it
eat
or
kill
it
from
this
and
other
the
limbs
swelled
he
then
ordered
some
water
to
be
made
hot
to
abate
the
swelling
but
even
his
tender
mercies
were
cruel
the
cook
on
putting
his
hand
into
the
water
said
it
was
too
hot

this

swore
at
him

feet
to

the
nails
and

off
oiled
cloths

then
put
around
them

child
was
at
length
tied
to
a
heavy
log
two
or
three
days

the
captain
caught
it
up
again
and
repeated
that
he
would
make
it
eat
or
kill
it
he
immediately
flogged
it
again
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
it
died
and

the
babe
was
dead

should
the
barbarian
select
to

felt
so
strongly
that
men
engaged
in
what
is
called
the
african
traffic
kept
it
a
secret
if
they
could
even
before
the
laws
made
it
hazardous
no
man
of
the
least
principle
could
for
a
moment
think
of
engaging
in
such
enterprises
and
if
he
have
any
feeling
it
is
soon
destroyed
by
familiarity
with
scenes
of
guilt
and
anguish
the
result
is
that
the
is
a
monopoly
in
the
hands
of
the
very
wicked
and
this
is
one
reason
why
it
has
always
been
profitable
yet
even
the
has
had
it
champions
of
course
among
those
who
had
money
invested
in
it
politicians
have
boldly
said
that
it
was
a
profitable
branch
of
commerce
and
ought
not
to
be
discontinued
on
account
of
the
idle
dreams
of
benevolent
enthusiasts
they
have
argued
before
the
house
of
commons
that
others
would
enslave
the
negroes
if
the
english
gave
it
up
as
if
it
were
allowable
for
one
man
to
commit
a
crime
because
another
was
likely
to
do
it
they
tell
how
merciful
it
is
to
bring
the
africans
away
from
the
despotism
and
wars
which
desolate
their
own
continent
but
they
do
not
add
that
the
white
man
is
himself
the
cause
of
those
wars
nor
do
they
prove
our
right
to
judge
for
another
man
where
he
will
be
the
happiest
if
the
turks
or
the
algerines
saw
fit
to
exercise
this
right
they
might
carry
away
captive
all
the
occupants
of
our
prisons
and
penitentiaries
some
of
the
advocates
of
this
traffic
maintained
that
the
voyage
from
africa
to
the
called
the
middle
passage
was
an
exceedingly
comfortable
portion
of
existence
one
went
so
far
as
to
declare
it
the
happiest
part
of
a
negro
life
they
aver
that
the
africans
on
their
way
to
slavery
are
so
merry
that
they
dance
and
sing
but
upon
a
careful
examination
of
witnesses
it
was
found
that
their
singing
consisted
of
lamentations
for
their
native
land
one
of
the
captains
threatened
to
flog
a
woman
because
the
mournfulness
of
her
song
was
too
painful
to
him
after
meals
they
jumped
up
in
their
irons
for
exercise
this
was
considered
so
necessary
for
their
health
that
they
were
whipped
if
they
refused
to
do
it
and
this
was
their
dancing
i
said
one
of
the
witnesses
was
employed
to
dance
the
men
while
another
person
danced
the
women
these
pretences
ridiculous
as
they
appear
are
worth
about
as
much
as
any
of
the
arguments
that
can
be
brought
forward
in
defence
of
any
part
of
the
slave
system
the
engraving
on
the
next
page
will
help
to
give
a
vivid
idea
of
the
elysium
enjoyed
by
negroes

voyage
where

and
no

are
admitted

that
those
shipped
are
at

that
sail
from

a
large
proportion

this
mortality
is
so
much
increased
by
various
causes
that
in
a
hundred
die
yearly

adds
it
is
a
destruction
which
if
general
but
for
ten
years
would
depopulate
the
world
and
extinguish
the
human
race
we
next
come
to
the
influence
of
this
diabolical
system
on
the
and
here
i
shall
be
cautioned
that
i
am
treading
on
delicate
ground
because
our
own
countrymen
are
slaveholders
but
i
am
yet
to
learn
that
wickedness
is
any
the
better
for
being
our
own
let
the
truth
be
spoken
and
let
those
abide
its
presence
who
can
the
following
is
the
testimony
of
jefferson
who
had
good
opportunities
for
observation
and
who
certainly
had
no
prejudices
there
must
doubtless
be
an
unhappy
influence
on
the
manners
of
the
people
produced
by
the
existence
of
slavery
among
us
the
whole
commerce
between
master
and
slave
is
a
perpetual
exercise
of
the
most
boisterous
passions
the
most
unremitting
despotism
on
the
one
part
and
degrading
submission
on
the
other
our
children
see
this
and
learn
to
imitate
it
for
man
is
an
imitative
animal
the
parent
storms
the
child
looks
on
catches
the
lineaments
of
wrath
puts
on
the
same
airs
in
a
circle
of
smaller
slaves
gives
loose
to
the
worst
of
passions
and
thus
nursed
educated
and
daily
exercised
in
tyranny
can
not
but
be
stamped
by
it
with
odious
peculiarities
the
man
must
be
a
prodigy
who
can
retain
his
morals
and
manners
undepraved
in
such
circumstances
in
a
community
where
all
the
labor
is
done
by
one
class
there
must
of
course
be
another
class
who
live
in
indolence
and
we
all
know
how
much
people
that
have
nothing
to
do
are
tempted
by
what
the
world
calls
pleasures
the
result
is
that
slaveholding
states
and
colonies
are
proverbial
for
dissipation
hence
too
the
contempt
for
industry
which
prevails
in
such
a
state
of
where
none
work
but
slaves
usefulness
becomes
degradation
the
wife
of
a
respectable
mechanic
who
accompanied
her
husband
from
massachusetts
to
the
south
gave
great
offence
to
her
new
neighbors
by
performing
her
usual
household
avocations
they
begged
her
to
desist
from
it
offering
the
services
of
their
own
blacks
because
the
sight
of
a
white
person
engaged
in
any
labor
was
extremely
injurious
to
the
slaves
they
deemed
it
very
important
that
the
negroes
should
be
taught
both
by
precept
and
example
that
they
alone
were
made
to
work
whether
the
undue
importance
attached
to
merely
external
gentility
and
the
increasing
tendency
to
indolence
and
extravagance
throughout
this
country
ought
to
be
attributed
in
any
degree
to
the
same
source
i
am
unable
to
say
if
influence
comes
to
us
from
the
example
and
ridicule
of
the
slaveholding
states
it
certainly
must
be
of
this
nature
there
is
another
view
of
this
system
which
i
can
not
unveil
so
completely
as
it
ought
to
be
i
shall
be
called
bold
for
saying
so
much
but
the
facts
are
so
important
that
it
is
a
matter
of
conscience
not
to
be
fastidious
the
negro
woman
is
unprotected
either
by
law
or
public
opinion
she
is
the
property
of
her
master
and
her
daughters
are
his
property
they
are
allowed
to
have
no
conscientious
scruples
no
sense
of
shame
no
regard
for
the
feelings
of
husband
or
parent
they
must
be
entirely
subservient
to
the
will
of
their
owner
on
pain
of
being
whipped
as
near
unto
death
as
will
comport
with
his
interest
or
quite
to
death
if
it
suit
his
pleasure
those
who
know
human
nature
would
be
able
to
conjecture
the
unavoidable
result
even
if
it
were
not
betrayed
by
the
amount
of
mixed
population
think
for
a
moment
what
a
degrading
effect
must
be
produced
on
the
morals
of
both
blacks
and
whites
by
customs
like
these
considering
we
live
in
the
nineteenth
century
it
is
indeed
a
strange
state
of
society
where
the
father
sells
his
child
and
the
brother
puts
his
sister
up
at
auction
yet
these
things
are
often
practised
in
our
republic
doctor
walsh
in
his
account
of
brazil
tells
an
anecdote
of
one
of
these
fathers
who
love
their
offspring
at
market
price
for
many
years
says
he
this
man
kept
his
son
in
slavery
and
maintained
the
right
to
dispose
of
him
as
he
would
of
his
mule
being
ill
however
and
near
to
die
he
made
his
will
left
his
child
his
freedom
and
apprised
him
of
it
some
time
after
he
recovered
and
having
a
dispute
with
the
young
man
he
threatened
to
sell
him
with
the
rest
of
his
stock
the
son
determined
to
prevent
this
assassinated
his
father
in
a
wood
got
possession
of
the
will
demanded
his
freedom
and
obtained
it
this
circumstance
was
perfectly
well
known
in
the
neighborhood
but
no
process
was
instituted
against
him
he
was
not
chargeable
as
i
could
hear
with
any
other
delinquency
than
the
horrible
one
of
murdering
his
father
to
obtain
his
freedom
this
forms
a
fine
picture
of
the
effects
of
slavery
upon
human
relations
f
footnote
f
a
short
time
ago
a
reverend
and
very
benevolent
gentleman
suggested
as
the
subject
of
a
book
beauty
of
human
what
a
bitter
jest
it
would
be
to
send
him
this
volume
with
the
information
that
i
had
complied
with
his
request
i
have
more
than
once
heard
people
who
had
just
returned
from
the
south
speak
of
seeing
a
number
of
mulattoes
in
attendance
where
they
visited
whose
resemblance
to
the
head
of
the
family
was
too
striking
not
to
be
immediately
observed
what
sort
of
feeling
must
be
excited
in
the
minds
of
those
slaves
by
being
constantly
exposed
to
the
tyranny
or
caprice
of
their
own
brothers
and
sisters
and
by
the
knowledge
that
these
near
relations
will
on
a
division
of
the
estate
have
power
to
sell
them
off
with
the
cattle
but
the
vices
of
white
men
eventually
provide
a
scourge
for
themselves
they
increase
the
negro
race
but
the
negro
can
never
increase
theirs
and
this
is
one
great
reason
why
the
proportion
of
colored
population
is
always
so
large
in
slaveholding
countries
as
the
ratio
increases
more
and
more
every
year
the
colored
people
must
eventually
be
the
stronger
party
and
when
this
result
happens
slavery
must
either
be
abolished
or
government
must
furnish
troops
of
whose
wages
the
free
states
must
pay
their
proportion
as
a
proof
of
the
effects
of
slavery
on
the
temper
i
will
relate
but
very
few
anecdotes
the
first
happened
in
the
bahamas
it
is
extracted
from
a
despatch
of
huskisson
to
the
governor
of
those
islands
henry
and
helen
moss
have
been
found
guilty
of
a
for
their
cruelty
to
their
slave
kate
and
those
facts
of
the
case
which
seem
beyond
dispute
appear
to
be
as
follows
kate
was
a
domestic
slave
and
is
stated
to
have
been
guilty
of
theft
she
is
also
accused
of
disobedience
in
refusing
to
mend
her
clothes
and
do
her
work
and
this
was
the
more
immediate
cause
of
her
punishment
on
the
of
july
eighteen
hundred
and
she
was
confined
in
the
stocks
and
she
was
not
released
till
the
eighth
of
august
following
being
a
period
of
seventeen
days
the
stocks
were
so
constructed
that
she
could
not
sit
up
or
lie
down
at
pleasure
and
she
remained
in
them
night
and
day
during
this
period
she
was
flogged
repeatedly
one
of
the
overseers
thinks
about
six
times
and
red
pepper
was
rubbed
upon
her
eyes
to
prevent
her
sleeping
tasks
were
given
her
which
in
the
opinion
of
the
same
overseer
she
was
incapable
of
performing
sometimes
because
they
were
beyond
her
powers
at
other
times
because
she
could
not
see
to
do
them
on
account
of
the
pepper
having
been
rubbed
on
her
eyes
and
she
was
flogged
for
failing
to
accomplish
these
tasks
a
violent
distemper
had
prevailed
on
the
plantation
during
the
summer
it
is
in
evidence
that
on
one
of
the
days
of
kate
confinement
she
complained
of
fever
and
that
one
of
the
floggings
she
received
was
the
day
after
she
made
the
complaint
when
she
was
taken
out
of
the
stocks
she
appeared
to
be
cramped
and
was
then
again
flogged
the
very
day
of
her
release
she
was
sent
to
field
labor
though
heretofore
a
and
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
ensuing
was
brought
before
her
owners
as
being
ill
and
refusing
to
work
and
she
then
again
complained
of
having
fever
they
were
of
opinion
that
she
had
none
then
but
gave
directions
to
the
driver
if
she
should
be
ill
to
bring
her
to
them
for
medicines
in
the
morning
the
driver
took
her
to
the
and
again
flogged
her
though
at
this
time
apparently
without
orders
from
her
owners
to
do
so
in
the
morning
at
seven
she
was
taken
to
work
in
the
field
where
she
died
at
noon
the
facts
of
the
case
are
thus
far
incontrovertibly
established
and
i
deeply
lament
that
heinous
as
the
offences
are
which
this
narrative
exhibits
i
can
discover
no
material
palliation
of
them
amongst
the
other
circumstances
detailed
in
the
evidence
a
bill
of
indictment
for
murder
was
preferred
against
and
moss
the
grand
jury
threw
it
out
upon
two
other
bills
for
misdemeanors
a
verdict
of
guilty
was
returned
five
months
imprisonment
and
a
fine
of
three
hundred
pounds
was
the
only
punishment
for
this
deliberate
and
shocking
cruelty
in
the
next
chapter
it
will
be
seen
that
similar
are
committed
with
equal
impunity
in
this
country
i
do
not
know
how
much
odium
and
moss
generally
incurred
in
consequence
of
this
transaction
but
many
of
the
most
respectable
people
in
the
island
petitioned
for
a
mitigation
of
their
punishment
visited
them
in
prison
did
every
thing
to
identify
themselves
with
them
and
on
their
liberation
from
jail
gave
them
a
public
dinner
as
a
matter
of
triumph
the
witnesses
in
their
favor
even
went
so
far
as
to
insist
that
their
character
stood
high
for
humanity
among
the
neighboring
planters
i
believe
there
never
was
a
class
of
people
on
earth
so
determined
to
uphold
each
other
at
all
events
as
the
following
account
was
originally
written
by
the
rev
william
dickey
of
bloomingsburgh
to
the
rev
john
rankin
of
ripley
ohio
it
was
published
in
in
a
little
volume
of
letters
on
the
subject
of
slavery
by
the
rev
rankin
who
assures
us
that
dickey
was
well
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
he
describes
in
the
county
of
livingston
kentucky
near
the
mouth
of
cumberland
river
lived
lilburn
lewis
the
son
of
jefferson
sister
he
was
the
wealthy
owner
of
a
considerable
number
of
slaves
whom
he
drove
constantly
fed
sparingly
and
lashed
severely
the
consequence
was
they
would
run
away
among
the
rest
was
an
boy
about
seventeen
who
having
just
returned
from
a
skulking
spell
was
sent
to
the
spring
for
water
and
in
returning
let
fall
an
elegant
pitcher
which
dashed
to
shivers
on
the
rocks
it
was
night
and
the
slaves
were
all
at
home
the
master
had
them
collected
into
the
most
roomy
and
a
rousing
fire
made
reader
what
follows
is
very
shocking
but
i
have
already
said
we
must
not
allow
our
nerves
to
be
more
sensitive
than
our
consciences
if
such
things
are
done
in
our
country
it
is
important
that
we
should
know
of
them
and
seriously
reflect
upon
them
the
door
was
fastened
that
none
of
the
negroes
either
through
fear
or
sympathy
should
attempt
to
escape
he
then
told
them
that
the
design
of
this
meeting
was
to
teach
them
to
remain
at
home
and
obey
his
orders
all
things
being
now
in
train
george
was
called
up
and
by
the
assistance
of
his
younger
brother
laid
on
a
broad
bench
or
block
the
master
then
cut
off
his
ancles
with
a
broad
axe
in
vain
the
unhappy
victim
screamed
not
a
hand
among
so
many
dared
to
interfere
having
cast
the
feet
into
the
fire
he
lectured
the
negroes
at
some
length
he
then
proceeded
to
cut
off
his
limbs
below
the
knees
the
sufferer
besought
him
to
begin
with
his
head
it
was
in
vain
the
master
went
on
thus
until
trunk
arms
and
head
were
all
in
the
fire
still
protracting
the
intervals
with
lectures
and
threatenings
of
like
punishment
in
case
any
of
them
were
disobedient
or
ran
away
or
disclosed
the
tragedy
they
were
compelled
to
witness
in
order
to
consume
the
bones
the
fire
was
briskly
stirred
until
midnight
when
as
if
heaven
and
earth
combined
to
show
their
detestation
of
the
deed
a
sudden
shock
of
earthquake
threw
down
the
heavy
wall
composed
of
rock
and
clay
extinguished
the
fire
and
covered
the
remains
of
george
the
negroes
were
allowed
to
disperse
with
charges
to
keep
the
secret
under
the
penalty
of
like
punishment
when
his
wife
asked
the
cause
of
the
dreadful
screams
she
had
heard
he
said
that
he
had
never
enjoyed
himself
so
well
at
a
ball
as
he
had
enjoyed
himself
that
evening
next
morning
he
ordered
the
wall
to
be
rebuilt
and
he
himself
superintended
picking
up
the
remains
of
the
boy
and
placing
them
within
the
new
wall
thus
hoping
to
conceal
the
matter
but
some
of
the
negroes
whispered
the
horrid
deed
the
neighbors
tore
down
the
wall
and
finding
the
remains
they
testified
against
him
he
was
bound
over
to
await
the
sitting
of
the
court
but
before
that
period
arrived
he
committed
suicide
b
this
happened
in
if
i
be
correct
it
was
on
the
of
december
it
was
on
the
sabbath
rankin
adds
there
was
little
probability
that
lewis
would
have
fallen
under
the
sentence
of
the
law
notwithstanding
the
peculiar
enormity
of
his
offence
there
were
individuals
who
combined
to
let
him
out
of
prison
in
order
to
screen
him
from
justice
another
instance
of
summary
punishment
inflicted
on
a
runaway
slave
is
told
by
a
respectable
gentleman
from
south
carolina
with
whom
i
am
acquainted
he
was
young
when
the
circumstance
occurred
in
the
neighborhood
of
his
home
and
it
filled
him
with
horror
a
slave
being
missing
several
planters
united
in
a
negro
hunt
as
it
is
called
they
set
out
with
dogs
guns
and
horses
as
they
would
to
chase
a
tiger
the
poor
fellow
being
discovered
took
refuge
in
a
tree
where
he
was
deliberately
shot
by
his
pursuers
in
some
of
the
west
indies
are
employed
to
hunt
negroes
and
this
fact
is
the
foundation
of
one
of
the
most
painfully
interesting
scenes
in
miss
martineau
demerara
a
writer
by
the
name
of
dallas
has
the
hardihood
to
assert
that
it
is
mere
sophistry
to
censure
the
practice
of
training
dogs
to
devour
men
he
asks
did
not
the
asiatics
employ
elephants
in
war
if
a
man
were
bitten
by
a
mad
dog
would
he
hesitate
to
cut
off
the
wounded
part
in
order
to
save
his
life
it
is
said
that
when
the
first
pack
of
arrived
in
domingo
the
white
planters
delivered
to
them
the
first
negro
they
found
merely
by
way
of
experiment
and
when
they
saw
him
immediately
torn
in
pieces
they
were
highly
delighted
to
find
the
dogs
so
well
trained
to
their
business
some
authentic
records
of
female
cruelty
would
seem
perfectly
incredible
were
it
not
an
established
law
of
our
nature
that
tyranny
becomes
a
habit
and
scenes
of
suffering
often
repeated
render
the
heart
callous
a
young
friend
of
mine
remarkable
for
the
kindness
of
his
disposition
and
the
courtesy
of
his
manners
told
me
that
he
was
really
alarmed
at
the
change
produced
in
his
character
by
a
few
months
residence
in
the
west
indies
the
family
who
owned
the
plantation
were
absent
and
he
saw
nothing
around
him
but
slaves
the
consequence
was
that
he
insensibly
acquired
a
dictatorial
manner
and
habitual
disregard
to
the
convenience
of
his
inferiors
the
candid
admonition
of
a
friend
made
him
aware
of
this
and
his
natural
amiability
was
restored
the
ladies
who
remove
from
the
free
states
into
the
slaveholding
ones
almost
invariably
write
that
the
sight
of
slavery
was
at
first
exceedingly
painful
but
that
they
soon
become
habituated
to
it
and
after
awhile
they
are
very
apt
to
vindicate
the
system
upon
the
ground
that
it
is
extremely
convenient
to
have
such
submissive
servants
this
reason
was
actually
given
by
a
lady
of
my
acquaintance
who
is
considered
an
unusually
fervent
christian
yet
christianity
expressly
teaches
us
to
love
our
neighbor
as
ourselves
this
shows
how
dangerous
it
is
for
even
the
best
of
us
to
become
to
what
is
wrong
a
judicious
and
benevolent
friend
lately
told
me
the
story
of
one
of
her
relatives
who
married
a
and
removed
to
his
plantation
the
lady
in
question
was
considered
very
amiable
and
had
a
serene
affectionate
expression
of
countenance
after
several
years
residence
among
her
slaves
she
visited
her
history
was
written
in
her
face
said
my
friend
its
expression
had
changed
into
that
of
a
fiend
she
brought
but
few
slaves
with
her
and
those
few
were
of
course
compelled
to
perform
additional
labor
one
faithful
nursed
the
twins
of
her
mistress
and
did
all
the
washing
ironing
and
scouring
if
after
a
sleepless
night
with
the
restless
babes
driven
from
the
bosom
of
their
own
mother
she
performed
her
toilsome
avocations
with
diminished
activity
her
mistress
with
her
own
hands
applied
the
cowskin
and
the
neighborhood
resounded
with
the
cries
of
her
victim
the
instrument
of
punishment
was
actually
kept
hanging
in
the
entry
to
the
no
small
disgust
of
her
visiters
for
my
part
continued
my
friend
i
did
not
try
to
be
polite
to
her
for
i
was
not
hypocrite
enough
to
conceal
my
indignation
the
following
occurred
near
natchez
and
was
told
to
me
by
a
highly
intelligent
man
who
being
a
diplomatist
and
a
courtier
was
very
likely
to
make
the
best
of
national
evils
a
planter
had
occasion
to
send
a
female
slave
some
distance
on
an
errand
she
did
not
return
so
soon
as
he
expected
and
he
grew
angry
at
last
he
gave
orders
that
she
should
be
severely
whipped
when
she
came
back
when
the
poor
creature
arrived
she
pleaded
for
mercy
saying
she
had
been
so
very
ill
that
she
was
obliged
to
rest
in
the
fields
but
she
was
ordered
to
receive
another
dozen
lashes
for
having
had
the
impudence
to
speak
she
died
at
the
nor
did
she
perish
alone
a
baby
died
with
her
the
gentleman
who
told
me
this
fact
witnessed
the
poor
funeral
it
is
true
the
master
was
universally
blamed
and
shunned
for
the
cruel
deed
but
the
laws
were
powerless
i
shall
be
told
that
such
examples
as
these
are
of
rare
occurrence
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
instances
of
excessive
severity
are
far
from
being
common
i
believe
that
a
large
proportion
of
masters
are
as
kind
to
their
slaves
as
they
can
be
consistently
with
keeping
them
in
bondage
but
it
must
be
allowed
that
this
to
make
the
best
of
it
is
very
stinted
kindness
and
let
it
never
be
forgotten
that
the
negro
fate
depends
entirely
on
the
character
of
his
master
and
it
is
a
mere
matter
of
chance
whether
he
fall
into
merciful
or
unmerciful
hands
his
happiness
nay
his
very
life
depends
on
chance
the
are
always
telling
us
that
the
accounts
of
slave
misery
are
abominably
exaggerated
and
their
plea
is
supported
by
many
individuals
who
seem
to
think
that
charity
was
made
to
sins
not
to
them
but
without
listening
to
the
zealous
opposers
of
slavery
we
shall
find
in
the
judicial
reports
of
the
southern
states
and
in
the
ordinary
details
of
their
newspapers
more
than
enough
to
startle
us
besides
we
must
not
forget
that
where
one
instance
of
cruelty
comes
to
our
knowledge
hundreds
are
kept
secret
and
the
more
public
attention
is
awakened
to
the
subject
the
more
caution
will
be
used
in
this
respect
why
should
we
be
deceived
by
the
sophistry
of
those
whose
interest
it
is
to
gloss
over
iniquity
and
who
from
long
habit
have
learned
to
believe
that
it
is
no
iniquity
it
is
a
very
simple
process
to
judge
rightly
in
this
matter
just
ask
yourself
the
question
where
you
could
find
a
set
of
men
in
whose
power
you
would
be
willing
to
place
yourself
if
the
laws
allowed
them
to
sin
against
you
with
impunity
but
it
is
urged
that
it
is
the
interest
of
planters
to
treat
their
slaves
well
this
argument
no
doubt
has
some
force
and
it
is
the
poor
negro
only
security
but
it
is
likewise
the
interest
of
men
to
treat
their
cattle
kindly
yet
we
see
that
passion
and
avarice
do
overcome
the
strongest
motives
of
interest
cattle
are
beat
unmercifully
sometimes
unto
death
they
are
ruined
by
being
weakened
by
want
of
sufficient
food
and
so
forth
besides
it
is
sometimes
directly
the
interest
of
the
planter
to
work
his
slaves
beyond
their
strength
when
there
is
a
sudden
rise
in
the
prices
of
sugar
a
certain
amount
of
labor
in
a
given
time
is
of
more
consequence
to
the
owner
of
a
plantation
than
the
price
of
several
slaves
he
can
well
to
waste
a
few
lives
this
is
no
idle
hypothesis
such
calculations
are
gravely
and
openly
made
by
planters
hence
it
is
the
slave
prayer
that
sugars
may
be
cheap
when
the
negro
is
old
or
feeble
from
incurable
disease
is
it
his
master
to
feed
him
well
and
clothe
him
comfortably
certainly
not
it
then
becomes
desirable
to
get
rid
of
the
human
brute
as
soon
as
convenient
it
is
a
common
remark
that
it
is
not
quite
safe
in
most
cases
for
even
parents
to
be
entirely
dependant
on
the
generosity
of
their
children
and
if
human
nature
be
such
what
has
the
slave
to
expect
when
he
becomes
a
mere
bill
of
expense
it
is
a
common
retort
to
say
that
who
go
to
the
south
soon
learn
to
patronize
the
system
they
have
considered
so
abominable
and
often
become
proverbial
for
their
severity
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
of
the
fact
for
slavery
contaminates
all
that
comes
within
its
influence
it
would
be
very
absurd
to
imagine
that
the
inhabitants
of
one
state
are
worse
than
the
inhabitants
of
another
unless
some
peculiar
circumstances
of
universal
influence
tend
to
make
them
so
human
nature
is
every
where
the
same
but
developed
differently
by
different
incitements
and
temptations
it
is
the
business
of
wise
legislation
to
discover
what
influences
are
most
productive
of
good
and
the
least
conducive
to
evil
if
we
were
educated
at
the
south
we
should
no
doubt
vindicate
slavery
and
inherit
as
a
birthright
all
the
evils
it
engrafts
upon
the
character
if
they
lived
on
our
rocky
soil
and
under
our
inclement
skies
their
shrewdness
would
sometimes
border
upon
knavery
and
their
frugality
sometimes
degenerate
into
parsimony
we
both
have
our
virtues
and
our
faults
induced
by
the
influences
under
which
we
live
and
of
course
totally
different
in
their
character
defects
are
bad
enough
but
they
can
not
like
slavery
affect
the
destiny
and
rights
of
millions
all
this
mutual
recrimination
about
gamblers
and
venders
of
is
quite
unworthy
of
a
great
nation
instead
of
calmly
examining
this
important
subject
on
the
plain
grounds
of
justice
and
humanity
we
allow
it
to
degenerate
into
a
mere
question
of
pride
and
vanity
pardon
the
americanism
would
we
had
less
for
the
word
it
is
the
not
the
on
which
we
ought
to
bestow
the
full
measure
of
abhorrence
if
we
were
willing
to
forget
ourselves
and
could
like
true
republicans
prefer
the
common
good
to
all
other
considerations
there
would
not
be
a
slave
in
the
united
states
at
the
end
of
half
a
century
the
arguments
in
support
of
slavery
are
all
hollow
and
deceptive
though
frequently
very
specious
no
one
thinks
of
finding
a
foundation
for
the
system
in
the
principles
of
truth
and
justice
and
the
unavoidable
result
is
that
even
in
it
is
unsound
the
monstrous
fabric
rests
on
the
mere
of
present
expediency
while
in
fact
all
its
tendencies
individual
and
national
present
and
remote
are
highly
injurious
to
the
true
interests
of
the
country
the
will
not
believe
this
the
stronger
the
evidence
against
his
favorite
theories
the
more
strenuously
he
defends
them
it
has
been
wisely
said
honesty
the
best
policy
but
policy
without
honesty
never
finds
that
out
i
hope
none
will
be
so
literal
as
to
suppose
i
intend
to
say
that
no
planter
can
be
honest
in
the
common
acceptation
of
that
term
i
simply
mean
that
all
who
ground
their
arguments
in
policy
and
not
in
duty
and
plain
truth
are
really
blind
to
the
highest
and
best
interests
of
man
among
other
apologies
for
slavery
it
has
been
asserted
that
the
bible
does
not
forbid
it
neither
does
it
forbid
the
counterfeiting
of
a
it
is
the
of
the
holy
word
not
its
particular
which
must
be
a
rule
for
our
conduct
how
can
slavery
be
reconciled
with
the
maxim
do
unto
others
as
ye
would
that
others
should
do
unto
you
does
not
the
command
thou
shalt
not
prohibit
and
how
does
whipping
men
to
death
agree
with
the
injunction
thou
shalt
do
no
are
we
not
told
to
loose
the
bands
of
wickedness
to
undo
the
heavy
burdens
to
let
the
oppressed
go
free
and
to
break
every
yoke
it
was
a
jewish
law
that
he
who
stole
a
man
or
sold
him
or
he
in
whose
hands
the
stolen
man
was
found
should
suffer
death
and
he
in
whose
house
a
fugitive
slave
sought
an
asylum
was
forbidden
to
give
him
up
to
his
master
modern
slavery
is
so
unlike
hebrew
servitude
and
its
regulations
are
so
diametrically
opposed
to
the
rules
of
the
gospel
which
came
to
bring
deliverance
to
the
captive
that
it
is
idle
to
dwell
upon
this
point
the
advocates
of
this
system
seek
for
arguments
in
the
history
of
every
age
and
nation
but
the
fact
is
is
totally
different
from
any
other
form
of
bondage
that
ever
existed
and
if
it
were
not
so
are
we
to
copy
the
evils
of
bad
governments
and
benighted
ages
the
difficulty
of
subduing
slavery
on
account
of
the
great
number
of
interests
which
become
united
in
it
and
the
prodigious
strength
of
the
selfish
passions
enlisted
in
its
support
is
by
no
means
its
least
alarming
feature
this
hydra
has
ten
thousand
heads
every
one
of
which
will
bite
or
growl
when
the
broad
daylight
of
truth
lays
open
the
secrets
of
its
hideous
den
i
shall
perhaps
be
asked
why
i
have
said
so
much
about
the
since
it
was
long
ago
abolished
in
this
country
there
are
several
good
reasons
for
it
in
the
first
place
it
is
a
part
of
the
system
for
if
there
were
no
slaves
there
could
be
no
and
while
there
are
slaves
the
continue
in
the
next
place
the
trade
is
still
briskly
carried
on
in
africa
and
slaves
are
smuggled
into
these
states
through
the
spanish
colonies
in
the
third
place
a
very
extensive
internal
is
carried
on
in
this
country
the
breeding
of
for
the
foreign
markets
of
louisiana
georgia
alabama
arkansas
and
missouri
is
a
very
lucrative
branch
of
business
whole
coffles
of
them
chained
and
manacled
are
driven
through
our
capital
on
their
way
to
auction
foreigners
particularly
those
who
come
here
with
enthusiastic
ideas

were

a
chain
perhaps
forty
feet

was
stretched

were
joined

about
thirty
women
tied

despair
was

broken

the
sound
of

was
carried
by

may
have
mistaken
some
of
the
punctilios
of

the

could

that

he
believed
it

a
representative
in
congress
from
delaware
told
torrey
of
philadelphia
that
he
was
often
afraid
to
send
his
servants
out
in
the
evening
lest
they
should
be
encountered
by
kidnappers
wherever
these
notorious
appear
in
our
southern
states
the
free
people
of
color
hide
themselves
as
they
are
obliged
to
do
on
the
coast
of
africa
the
following
is
the
testimony
of
torrey
of
philadelphia
published
in
to
enumerate
all
the
horrid
and
aggravating
instances
of
which
are
known
to
have
occurred
in
the
state
of
delaware
within
the
recollection
of
many
of
the
citizens
of
that
state
would
require
a
volume
in
many
cases
whole
families
of
free
colored
people
have
been
attacked
in
the
night
beaten
to
death
with
clubs
gagged
and
bound
and
dragged
into
distant
and
hopeless
captivity
leaving
no
traces
behind
except
the
blood
from
their
wounds
during
the
last
winter
the
house
of
a
free
black
family
was
broken
open
and
its
defenceless
inhabitants
treated
in
the
manner
just
mentioned
except
that
the
mother
escaped
from
their
merciless
grasp
while
on
their
way
to
the
state
of
maryland
the
plunderers
of
whom
there
were
nearly
half
a
dozen
conveyed
their
prey
upon
horses
and
the
woman
being
placed
on
one
of
the
horses
behind
improved
an
opportunity
as
they
were
passing
a
house
and
sprang
off
not
daring
to
pursue
her
they
proceeded
on
leaving
her
youngest
child
a
little
farther
along
by
the
side
of
the
road
in
expectation
it
is
supposed
that
its
cries
would
attract
the
mother
but
she
prudently
waited
until
morning
and
recovered
it
again
in
safety
i
consider
myself
more
fully
warranted
in
particularizing
this
fact
from
the
circumstances
of
having
been
at
newcastle
at
the
time
that
the
woman
was
brought
with
her
child
before
the
grand
jury
for
examination
and
of
having
seen
several
of
the
persons
against
whom
bills
of
indictment
were
found
on
the
charge
of
being
engaged
in
the
perpetration
of
the
outrage
and
also
that
one
or
two
of
them
were
the
same
who
were
accused
of
assisting
in
seizing
and
carrying
off
another
woman
and
child
whom
i
discovered
at
washington
a
monster
in
human
shape
was
detected
in
the
city
of
philadelphia
pursuing
the
occupation
of
courting
and
marrying
mulatto
women
and
selling
them
as
slaves
in
his
last
attempt
of
this
kind
the
fact
having
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
african
population
of
this
city
a
mob
was
immediately
collected
and
he
was
only
saved
from
being
torn
in
atoms
by
being
deposited
in
the
city
prison
they
have
lately
invented
a
method
of
attaining
their
object
through
the
instrumentality
of
the
laws
having
selected
a
suitable
free
colored
person
to
make
a
upon
the
kidnapper
employs
a
confederate
to
ascertain
the
distinguishing
marks
of
his
body
he
then
claims
and
obtains
him
as
a
slave
before
a
magistrate
by
describing
those
marks
and
proving
the
truth
of
his
assertions
by
his
accomplice
from
the
best
information
that
i
have
had
opportunities
to
collect
in
travelling
by
various
routes
through
the
states
of
delaware
and
maryland
i
am
fully
convinced
that
there
are
at
this
time
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
several
thousands
of
legally
free
people
of
color
toiling
under
the
yoke
of
involuntary
servitude
and
transmitting
the
same
fate
to
their
posterity
if
the
probability
of
this
fact
could
be
authenticated
to
the
recognition
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
it
is
presumed
that
its
members
as
agents
of
the
constitution
and
guardians
of
the
public
liberty
would
without
hesitation
devise
means
for
the
restoration
of
those
unhappy
victims
of
violence
and
avarice
to
their
freedom
and
constitutional
personal
rights
the
work
both
from
its
nature
and
magnitude
is
impracticable
to
individuals
or
benevolent
societies
besides
it
is
perfectly
a
national
business
and
claims
national
interference
equally
with
the
captivity
of
our
sailors
in
algiers
it
may
indeed
be
said
in
palliation
of
the
internal
that
the
horrors
of
the
are
avoided
but
still
the
amount
of
misery
is
very
great
husbands
and
wives
parents
and
children
are
rudely
torn
from
each
other
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
this
fact
advertisements
are
very
common
in
which
a
mother
and
her
children
are
offered
either
in
a
lot
or
separately
as
may
suit
the
purchaser
in
one
of
these
advertisements

pledged
itself
not

five

counted
the

three
freemen
of
course
every
fresh
cargo
was
not
only
an
increase
of
property
but
an
increase
of
ample
time
was
allowed
to
lay
in
a
stock
of
slaves
to
supply
the
new
slave
states

territories
that
might
grow
up

when
this
was
effected
the
prohibition

complete
to
protect

some

truths

fall
and

nature

the
care
of
all
these
wrongs
in
place
would
force
a
tear
but
call
for
stronger
deeper
feeling
oh
sons
of
freedom
equalize
your
laws
be
all
consistent
plead
the
negro
cause
then
all
the
nations
in
your
code
may
see
that
black
or
white
americans
are
free
between
ancient
and
modern
slavery
there
is
this
remarkable
distinction
the
former
originated
in
motives
of
humanity
the
latter
is
dictated
solely
by
avarice
the
ancients
made
slaves
of
captives
taken
in
war
as
an
amelioration
of
the
original
custom
of
indiscriminate
slaughter
the
moderns
attack
defenceless
people
without
any
provocation
and
steal
them
for
the
express
purpose
of
making
them
slaves
modern
slavery
indeed
in
all
its
particulars
is
more
odious
than
the
ancient
and
it
is
worthy
of
remark
that
the
condition
of
slaves
has
always
been
worse
just
in
proportion
to
the
freedom
enjoyed
by
their
masters
in
greece
none
were
so
proud
of
liberty
as
the
spartans
and
they
were
a
proverb
among
the
neighboring
states
for
their
severity
to
slaves
the
slave
code
of
the
roman
republic
was
rigid
and
tyrannical
in
the
extreme
and
cruelties
became
so
common
and
excessive
that
the
emperors
in
the
latter
days
of
roman
power
were
obliged
to
enact
laws
to
restrain
them
in
the
modern
world
england
and
america
are
the
most
conspicuous
for
enlightened
views
of
freedom
and
bold
vindication
of
the
equal
rights
of
man
yet
in
these
two
countries
slave
laws
have
been
framed
as
bad
as
they
were
in
pagan
rome
and
the
customs
are
in
some
respects
more
oppressive
slavery
unquestionably
wears
its
very
worst
aspect
in
the
colonies
of
england
and
the
united
states
of
north
america
i
hardly
know
how
to
decide
their
respective
claims
my
countrymen
are
fond
of
and
i
am
afraid
they
deserve
it
here
especially
if
we
throw
into
the
scale
their
loud
boasts
of
superiority
over
all
the
rest
of
the
world
in
civil
and
religious
freedom
the
slave
codes
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
british
west
indies
were
originally
almost
precisely
the
same
but
laws
have
been
growing
milder
and
milder
while
have
increased
in
severity
the
british
have
the
advantage
of
us
in
this
respect
they
long
ago
dared
to
describe
the
monster
as
it
is
and
they
are
now
grappling
with
it
with
the
overwhelming
strength
of
a
great
nation
concentrated
the
dutch
those
sturdy
old
friends
of
liberty
and
the
french
who
have
been
stark
mad
for
freedom
rank
next
for
the
severity
of
their
slave
laws
and
customs
the
spanish
and
portuguese
are
milder
than
either
i
will
give
a
brief
view
of
some
of
our
own
laws
on
this
subject
for
the
correctness
of
which
i
refer
the
reader
to
stroud
sketch
of
the
slave
laws
of
the
united
states
of
america
in
the
first
place
we
will
inquire
upon
what
ground
the
negro
slaves
in
this
country
are
claimed
as
property
most
of
them
are
the
descendants
of
persons
kidnapped
on
the
coast
of
africa
and
brought
here
while
we
were
british
colonies
and
as
the
was
openly
sanctioned
more
than
twenty
years
after
our
acknowledged
independence
in
and
as
the
traffic
is
still
carried
on
by
smugglers
there
are
no
doubt
thousands
of
slaves
now
living
in
the
united
states
who
are
actually
stolen
from
africa
j
footnote
j
in
the
new
slave
states
there
are
a
great
many
negroes
who
can
speak
no
other
language
than
some
of
the
numerous
african
dialects
a
provincial
law
of
maryland
enacted
that
any
white
woman
who
married
a
negro
slave
should
serve
his
master
during
her
husband
lifetime
and
that
all
their
children
should
be
slaves
this
law
was
not
repealed
until
the
end
of
eighteen
years
and
it
then
continued
in
full
force
with
regard
to
those
who
had
contracted
such
marriages
in
the
intermediate
time
therefore
the
descendants
of
white
women
so
situated
may
be
slaves
unto
the
present
day
the
doctrine
of
the
common
law
is
that
the
offspring
shall
follow
the
condition
of
the
but
slave
law
with
the
above
temporary
exception
reverses
the
common
law
and
provides
that
children
shall
follow
the
condition
of
the
hence
mulattoes
and
their
descendants
are
held
in
perpetual
bondage
though
the
is
a
free
white
man
any
person
whose
ancestor
even
in
the
degree
of
distance
can
be
shown
to
have
been
a
negro
indian
mulatto
or
a
mestizo
free
at
the
time
this
law
was
introduced
although
the
ancestor
at
each
successive
generation
may
have
been
a
man
is
declared
to
be
the
subject
of
perpetual
slavery
even
the
code
of
jamaica
is
on
this
head
more
liberal
than
ours
by
an
express
law
slavery
ceases
at
the
degree
of
distance
from
a
negro
ancestor
and
in
the
other
british
west
indies
the
established
custom
is
such
that
quadroons
or
mestizoes
as
they
call
the
second
and
third
degrees
are
rarely
seen
in
a
state
of
slavery
here
neither
law
nor
public
opinion
favors
the
mulatto
descendants
of
free
white
men
this
furnishes
a
convenient
game
to
the
slaveholder
it
enables
him
to
fill
his
purse
by
means
of
his
own
vices
the
right
to
sell
one
half
of
his
children
provides
a
fortune
for
the
had
the
maxim
of
the
common
law
been
allowed
that
the
offspring
follows
the
condition
of
the
the
mulattoes
almost
without
exception
would
have
been
free
and
thus
the
prodigious
and
alarming
increase
of
our
slave
population
might
have
been
prevented
the
great
augmentation
of
the
servile
class
in
the
southern
states
compared
with
the
west
india
colonies
has
been
thought
to
indicate
a
much
milder
form
of
slavery
but
there
are
other
causes
which
tend
to
produce
the
result
there
are
much
fewer
white
men
in
the
british
west
indies
than
in
our
slave
states
hence
the
increase
of
the
population
is
less
rapid
here
the
descendants
of
a
colored
mother

mention
of
them
as

to
be
met
with
in

of
most
of

states

confederacy

in
one
at

may
be
cited
to
sanction
their
enslavement
in
virginia
an
act
was
passed
in
declaring
that
for
better
encouragement
of
whatever
indian
prisoners
were
taken
in
a
war
in
which
the
colony
was
then
engaged
should
be
to
the

in
it
was
decreed
that
all

brought
into

ceased

the
descendants
of
all

in
the

time
are
now
among

the
law
is

on

that
it
is
the
established
custom
is
proved
by
laws
restraining
the
excessive
abuse
of
this

in
some
of

thus
in

there
is
a
fine
of
ten

for
making

on

unless
it
be
in

of

necessity
or
the

occasions
of

there
is
likewise
a
law
which
provides
that
any

withholds

or

at
the

of

the
negro
act
of

contains
the

language

many

shall
offend

at
the
discretion
of
the

before
whom
complaint
shall
be
made
in
louisiana
it
is
enacted
that
the
slaves
shall
be
allowed
half
an
hour
for
breakfast
during
the
whole
year
from
the
first
of
may
to
the
first
of
november
they
shall
be
allowed
two
hours
for
dinner
and
from
the
first
of
november
to
the
first
of
may
one
hour
and
a
half
for
dinner
provided
however
that
the
owners
who
will
themselves
take
the
trouble
of
having
the
meals
of
their
slaves
prepared
be
and
they
are
hereby
authorized
to
abridge
by
half
an
hour
a
day
the
time
fixed
for
their
rest
all
these
laws
for
the
protection
of
the
slave
are
rendered
perfectly
null
and
void
by
the
fact
that
the
testimony
of
a
negro
or
mulatto
is
taken
against
a
white
man
if
a
slave
be
found
toiling
in
the
field
on
the
sabbath
who
can
that
his
master
commanded
him
to
do
it
the
law
of
louisiana
stipulates
that
a
slave
shall
have
linen
shirt
k
and
a
pair
of
pantaloons
for
the
summer
and
linen
shirt
and
a
woollen
and
pantaloons
for
the
winter
and
for
food
one
pint
of
salt
and
a
barrel
of
indian
corn
rice
or
beans
every
month
in
north
carolina
the
law
decides
that
a
quart
of
corn
per
day
is
sufficient
but
if
the
slave
does
not
receive
this
poor
allowance
who
can
the
fact
the
withholding
of
proper
sustenance
is
absolutely
incapable
of
proof
unless
the
evidence
of
the
sufferer
himself
be
allowed
and
the
law
as
if
determined
to
obstruct
the
administration
of
justice
permits
the
master
to
exculpate
himself
by
an
oath
that
the
charges
against
him
are
false
clothing
may
indeed
be
ascertained
by
but
who
is
likely
to
involve
himself
in
quarrels
with
a
white
master
because
a
poor
negro
receives
a
few
rags
less
than
the
law
provides
i
apprehend
that
a
person
notorious
for
such
gratuitous
acts
of
kindness
would
have
little
peace
or
safety
in
any
slaveholding
country

though
i
find

expressly

not

cases
at

incompetent
witnesses

even
in

the
evidence
of

slaves
was
admitted
against
all
free
persons
the

only
excepted

that
in

as
well
as
in

where
the
testimony
of
white

could
not
be
found
to
establish
the
facts
in

the
merely
allowed
a

testimony
to
be
heard
by

as
a
suggestion
which
might
throw
light
on
other
evidence
without
amounting
of
itself
to
any
degree
of

proof

the

represented
to

great

stroud
says
there
was
a
time
in
many
if
not
in
all
the
slaveholding
districts
of
our
country
when
the
murder
of
a
slave
was
followed
by
a
pecuniary
fine
only
in
one
state
the
change
of
the
law
in
this
respect
has
been
very
recent
at
the
present
date
i
am
happy
to
say
the
wilful
malicious
deliberate
murder
of
a
slave
by
whomsoever
perpetrated
is
to
be
punishable
with
death
in
every
state
the
evil
is
not
that
the
laws
crime
but
that
they
do
not
it
and
this
arises
chiefly
if
not
solely
from
the
exclusion
of
the
testimony
on
the
trial
of
a
white
person
of
all
those
who
are
white
the
conflicting
influences
of
humanity
and
prejudice
are
strangely
contrasted
in
the
law
of
north
carolina
on
this
subject
an
act
passed
in
runs
thus
by
another
act
of
assembly
passed
in
the
year
the
killing
of
a
slave
however
wanton
cruel
and
deliberate
is
only
punishable
in
the
first
instance
by
imprisonment
and
paying
the
value
thereof
to
the
owner
which
distinction
of
criminality
between
the
murder
of
a
white
person
and
one
is
equally
a
human
creature
but
merely
of
a
different
is
disgraceful
to
humanity
and
degrading
in
the
highest
degree
to
the
laws
and
principles
of
a
free
christian
and
enlightened
country
be
it
enacted
that
if
any
person
shall
hereafter
be
guilty
of
wilfully
and
maliciously
killing
a
slave
such
offender
shall
upon
the
first
conviction
thereof
be
adjudged
guilty
of
murder
and
shall
suffer
the
same
punishment
as
if
he
had
killed
a
free
man
always
this
act
shall
not
extend
to
the
person
killing
a

outlawed
by
virtue
of
any
act
of

of
this
state
or
to
any

in
the
act
of

to
his
lawful
owner

or
to
any
dying
moderate
correction
footnote
n
it
has
been
judicially
determined
that
it
is
to
kill
a
slave
resisting
or
to
his
master
by
force
in
the
laws
of
tennessee
and
georgia
there
is
a
similar
proviso
where
could
such
a
monstrous
anomaly
be
found
save
in
a
code
of
slave
laws
of
punishment
truly
this
an
unveiling
of
consciences
to
set
the
matter
in
its
proper
light
it
may
be
added
that
a
proclamation
of
o
against
a
slave
is
authorized
whenever
he
runs
away
from
his
master
conceals
himself
in
some
obscure
retreat
and
to
sustain
life
kills
a
or
some
animal
of
the
cattle
kind
footnote
o
the
outlawry
of
a
slave
is
not
i
believe
an
unusual
occurrence
very
recently
a
particular
account
was
given
of
the
killing
of
a
black
man
charged
with
any
by
a
person
in
pursuit
of
an
slave
owing
as
it
was
stated
to
the
person
killed
not
a
call
made
by
his
pursuers
whether
the
call
was
or
not
of
course
could
not
be
assertained
nor
did
it
appear
to
have
excited
any
inquiry
a
pecuniary
mulct
was
the
only
restraint
upon
the
wilful
murder
of
a
slave
from
the
year
to
a
period
of
more
than
eighty
years
i
find
in
the
case
of
state
bay
it
is
said
incidentally
by
pinckney
and
ford
counsel
for
the
state
that
the
of
the
offence
was
owing
to
the
nature
of
the
punishment
this
was
said
in
the
public
by
men
of
great
respectability
nevertheless
thirty
years
elapsed
before
a
change
of
the
law
was
effected
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
learn
the
following
section
has
disgraced
the
of
south

from
the

here
is

declares

entirely
subject
to
the

of
the

who
may
correct

not
with
rigor

so
as

to

of

of

as
long
as
his

pleases
in
some
of
the

there
are
indeed
restraining
laws
but
they
are
completely
ineffectual
from
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
the
evidence
of

be
exerted
by
the
attorney

or
any
other
person
who
is
for
the
time
being
placed
over
the

by
order
of
the
owner
or
his
delegates
the
following
is
the
language
of
the
louisiana
code
and
it
represents
the
established
customs
of
all
the

states
condition
of
a
slave
being
merely
a
passive
one
his
subordination
to
his
master
and
to
all
who
him
is
not
susceptible
of
any
modification
or
restriction
except
in
what
can
incite
the
slave
to
the
commission
of
crime
in
such
manner
that
he
owes
to
his
master
and
to
all
his
family
a
respect
without
bounds
and
an
absolute
obedience
and
he
is
consequently
to
execute
all
the
orders
which
he
receives
from
his
said
master

from
them
what
chance
of
mercy
the
slave
has
from
the
generality
of
overseers
may
be
conjectured
from
the

torrey
in
his
portraiture
of

relates
an
affecting
anecdote
which
happened
near
washington
a
free
negro
walking
along
the
road
was
set
upon
by
two
intoxicated
ruffians
on
horseback
who
without
any
provocation
began
to
torture
him
for
one
of
them
tied
him
to
the
tail
of
his
horse
and
thus
dragged
him
along
while
the
other
followed
applying
the
lash

poor
fellow
died
by
the
roadside
in

of
this
treatment
the
may
prosecute
when
a

is
rendered
unfit

by
personal
violence

in

facts
come
to

of

the

so
formidable
that
it
can
hardly

these

are
obviously
made
to
prevent
insurrections

it
is
plain
that
they
must

interfere

the

follow
its
path
and
that
light
would
reveal
the
surrounding
darkness
slaves
might
begin
to
think
whether
slavery
could
be
reconciled
with
religious
precepts
and
then
the
system
is
quite
too
republican
it
teaches
that
all
men
are
children
of
the
same
heavenly
father
who
careth
alike
for
all
the
west
india
planters
boldly
and
openly
declared
that
slavery

christianity
could
not
exist
together
in
their

the
immediate
inference
was
that
christianity
must
be
put
down

consistently

no

fare

ancient
instruments

by
declaring
that

for
the
easing
of
their
consciences
and
the
safety
of
their

the

used
to

when

afflicted

baptism
was
generally
supposed
to
confer
freedom
on
the
slave
and
for
this
reason
masters
were
reluctant
to
have
them
baptized
they
got
over
this
difficulty
however
and
married
to
conscience
by
making
a
law
that
no
slave
should
become
free
by
being
a
christian
this
is
a
striking
proof
how
closely
christianity
and
liberty
are
associated
together
a
french
planter
of
domingo
in
a
book
which
he
published
concerning
that
colony
admits
that
it
is
desirable
to
have
negroes
know
enough
of
religion
to
make
them
friends
to
humanity
and
grateful
to
their
creator
but
he
considers
it
very
wrong
to
load
their
weak
minds
with
a
belief
in
supernatural
dogmas
such
as
a
belief
in
a
future
state
he
says
such
knowledge
is
apt
to
render
them
intractable
averse
to
labor
and
induces
them
to
commit
suicide
on
themselves
and
their
children
which
the
colony
the
state
and
commerce
have
equal
our
slaveholders
in
general
seem
desirous
to
have
the
slave
just
religious
enough
to
know
that
insurrections
and
murder
are
contrary
to
the
maxims
of
christianity
but
it
is
very
difficult
to
have
them
learn
just
so
much
as
this
without
learning
more
in
georgia
i
have
been
told
that
a
very
general
prejudice
prevails
against
white
missionaries
to
avoid
this
danger
old
domestic
slaves
who
are
better
informed
than
the
plantation
slaves
are
employed
to
hear
sermons
and
repeat
them
to
their
brethren
and
their
repetitions
are
said
to
be
strange
samples
of
pulpit
eloquence
one
of
these
old
negroes
as
the
story
goes
told
his
hearers
that
the
bible
said
slaves
ought
to
get
their
freedom
and
if
they
could
not
do
it
in
any
other
way
they
must
murder
their
masters
the
slaves
had
never
been
allowed
to
learn
to
read
and
of
course
they
could
not
dispute
that
such
a
doctrine
was
actually
in
the
scriptures
thus
do
unjust
and
absurd
laws
return
to
plague
the
inventor
prop
power
of
the
laws
exerted
to
keep

in

the
first

a

of
one
hundred
pounds
upon
any
person

any

unlawful

administered
upon

exceeding
twenty
lashes

q
yet
it
has
been
said
that
these
laws
are
entirely
owing
to
the
rash
efforts
of
the
abolitionists

the
law

the
same
the
city
of

a
few
years

passed
an
ordinance
by
which
any
person
that
teaches
a
person
of

slave

free
to
read

write
or
causes
such
persons
to
be

is
subject
to
a
fine
of
thirty
dollars
or
to
be
imprisoned
ten
days
and
whipped
lashes
from
these
facts
it
is
evident
that
legislative
power
prevents
a
master
from
giving
liberty
and
instruction
to
his
slave
even
when
such
a
course
would
be
willingly
pursued
by
a
benevolent
individual
the
laws
allow
almost
unlimited
power
to
do
but
the
power
to
do
is
effectually
restrained

is
a
monstrous
inequality
of

in

civilized
country
one
would
expect
that
if
any
disproportion
existed
in

it
would
be
in
favor
of
the
ignorant

defenceless

the
reverse
is
lamentably
the
case

the
price

pay

the
cruelties
which
negroes
suffer
from
them

it

aforesaid
the
last
authorized
edition
of
the
laws
of
maryland
comprises
the
following
if
any
slave
be
convicted
of
any
petit
treason
or
murder
or
wilfully
burning
of
it
may
be
lawful
for
the
justices
to
give
judgment
against
such
slave
to
have
the
right
hand
cut
off
to
be
hanged
in
the
usual
manner
the
head
severed
from
the
body
the
body
divided
into
four
quarters
and
the
head
and
quarters
set
up
in
the
most
public
places
of
the
county
the
laws
of
tennessee
and
missouri
are
comparatively
mild
yet
in
missouri
it
is
to
prepare
or
administer
medicine
without
the
master
consent
unless
it
can
be
that
there
was
no
evil
intention
the
law
in
virginia
is
similar
it
requires
proof
that
there
was
no
evil
intention
and
that
the
medicine
produced
no
bad
consequences
to
estimate
fully
the
cruel
injustice
of
these
laws
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
poor
slave
is
without
religious
instruction
unable
to
read
too
ignorant
to
comprehend
legislation
and
holding
so
little
communication
with
any
person
better
informed
than
himself
that
the
chance
is
he
does
not
even
know
the
of
half
the
laws
by
which
he
suffers
this
is
worthy
of
nero
who
caused
his
edicts
to
be
placed
so
high
that
they
could
not
be
read
and
then
beheaded
his
subjects
for
disobeying
them
prop
laws
operate
oppressively
on
free
colored
free
people
of
color
like
the
slaves
are
excluded
by
law
from
all
means
of
obtaining
the
common
elements
of
education
the
free
colored
man
may
at
any
time
be
taken
up
on
suspicion
and
be
condemned
and
imprisoned
as
a
runaway
slave
unless
he
can
the
contrary
and
be
it
remembered
none
but
evidence
or
written
documents
avail
him
the
common
law
supposes
a
man
to
be
innocent
until
he
is
proved
guilty
but
slave
law
turns
this
upside
down
every
colored
man
is
to
be
a
slave
till
it
can
be
proved
otherwise
this
rule
prevails
in
all
the
slave
states
except
north
carolina
where
it
is
confined
to
negroes
stephens
supposes
this
harsh
doctrine
to
be
peculiar
to
the
british
colonial
code
but
in
this
he
is
again
mistaken
the
american
share
the
honor
with
england
a
law
passed
in
december
in
south
carolina
provides
that
any
free
colored
persons
coming
into
port
on
board
of
any
vessel
shall
be
seized
and
imprisoned
during
the
stay
of
the
vessel
and
when
she
is
ready
to
depart
the
captain
shall
take
such
free
negroes
and
pay
the
expenses
of
their
arrest
and
imprisonment
and
in
case
of
refusing
so
to
do
he
shall
be
indicted
and
fined
not
less
than
one
thousand
dollars
and
imprisoned
not
less
than
two
months
and
such
free
negroes
shall
be
sold
for
slaves
the
circuit
court
of
the
united
states
adjudged
the
law
unconstitutional
and
void
yet
nearly
after
this
decision
four
colored
english
seamen
were
taken
out
of
the
brig
marmion
england
made
a
formal
complaint
to
our
government
wirt
the
gave
the
opinion
that
the
law
was
unconstitutional
this
as
well
as
the
decision
excited
strong
indignation
in
south
carolina
notwithstanding
the
decision
the
law
still
remains
in
force
and
other
states
have
followed
the
example
of
south
carolina
though
with
a
more
cautious
observance
of
appearances
in
south
carolina
if
any
free
negro
harbor
conceal
or
entertain
any
runaway
slave
or
a
slave
charged
with
criminal
matter
he
forfeits
ten
pounds
for
the
first
day
and
twenty
shillings
for
every
succeeding
day
in
case
of
inability
to
pay
the
free
negro
is
sold
at
auction
and
if
any
overplus
remain
after
the
fines
and
attendant
expenses
are
paid
it
is
put
into
the
hands
of
the
public
treasurer
the
free
negro
may
entertain
a
slave
without
that
he
has
done
any
thing
wrong
but
his
declaration
to
that
effect
is
of
no
avail
where
every
effort
is
made
to
prevent
colored
people
from
obtaining
any
money
they
are
of
course
often
unable
to
pay
the
penalties
imposed
if
any
omission
is
made
in
the
forms
of
emancipation
established
by
law
person
may
seize
the
negro
so
manumitted
and
appropriate
him
to
their
own
use
if
a
free
colored
person
remain
in
virginia
twelve
months
after
his
manumission
he
can
be
sold
by
the
overseers
of
the
poor
for
the
benefit
of
the
in
georgia
a
free
colored
man
except
a
regular
articled
seaman
is
fined
one
hundred
dollars
for
coming
into
the
state
and
if
he
can
not
pay
it
may
be
sold
at
public
outcry
this
act
has
been
changed
to
one
of
increased
severity
a
free
colored
person
can
not
be
a
witness
against
a
white
man
they
may
therefore
be
robbed
assaulted
kidnapped
and
carried
off
with
impunity
and
even
the
legislatures
of
the
old
slave
states
adopt
it
as
a
maxim
that
it
is
very
desirable
to
get
rid
of
them
it
is
of
no
avail
to
themselves
free
the
law
them
to
be
slaves
unless
they
can
to
the
contrary
in
many
instances
written
documents
of
freedom
have
been
wrested
from
free
colored
people
and
destroyed
by
kidnappers
a
lucrative
internal
furnishes
constant
temptation
to
the
commission
of
such
crimes
and
the
states
of
alabama
mississippi
missouri
and
the
territories
of
arkansas
and
the
floridas
are
not
likely
to
be
glutted
for
years
to
come
in
philadelphia
though
remote
from
a
slave
market
it
has
been
ascertained
that
than
free
persons
of
color
were
stolen
and
carried
off
within
years
stroud
says
five
of
these
have
been
restored
to
their
friends
by
the
interposition
of
humane
gentlemen
though
not
without
great
expense
and
difficulty
the
others
are
still
in
bondage
and
if
rescued
at
all
it
must
be
by
sending
witnesses
a
journey
of
more
than
a
thousand
miles
i
know
the
names
of
four
colored
citizens
of
massachusetts
who
went
to
georgia
on
board
a
vessel
were
seized
under
the
laws
of
that
state
and
sold
as
slaves
they
have
sent
the
most
earnest
exhortations
to
their
families
and
friends
to
do
something
for
their
relief
but
the
attendant
expenses
require
more
money
than
the
friends
of
negroes
are
apt
to
have
and
the
poor
fellows
as
yet
remain
unassisted
a
paper
november
contains
the
following
caution
of
kidnappers
it
is
that
there
is
at
present
in
this
city
a
gang
of
kidnappers
busily
engaged
in
their
vocation
of
stealing
colored
children
for
the
southern
market
it
is
believed
that
three
or
four
have
been
stolen
within
as
many
days
a
little
negro
boy
came
to
this
city
from
the
country
three
or
four
days
ago
some
strange
white
persons
were
very
friendly
to
him
and
yesterday
morning
he
was
mightily
pleased
that
they
had
given
him
some
new
clothes
and
the
persons
pretending
thus
to
befriend
him
entirely
secured
his
confidence
this
day
he
can
not
be
found
nor
can
he
be
traced
since
seen
with
one
of
his
new
friends
yesterday
there
are
suspicions
of
a
foul
nature
connected
with
some
who
serve
the
police
in
subordinate
capacities
it
is
hinted
that
there
may
be
those
in
some
authority
not
altogether
ignorant
of
these
diabolical
practices
let
the
public
be
on
their
guard
it
is
still
fresh
in
the
memories
of
all
that
a
cargo
or
rather
drove
of
negroes
was
made
up
from
this
city
and
philadelphia
about
the
time
that
the
emancipation
of
all
the
negroes
in
this
state
took
place
under
our
present
constitution
and
were
taken
through
virginia
the
carolinas
and
tennessee
and
disposed
of
in
the
state
of
mississippi
some
of
those
who
were
taken
from
philadelphia
were
persons
of
intelligence
and
after
they
had
been
driven
through
the
country
in
chains
and
disposed
of
by
sale
on
the
mississippi
wrote
back
to
their
friends
and
were
rescued
from
bondage
the
persons
who
were
guilty
of
this
abominable
transaction
are
known
and
now
reside
in
north
carolina
they
may
very
probably
be
engaged
in
similar
enterprises
at
the
present
time
at
least
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
system
of
kidnapping
free
persons
of
color
from
the
northern
cities
has
been
carried
on
more
extensively
than
the
public
are
generally
aware
of
this
and
other
evils
of
the
system
admit
of
no
radical
cure
but
the
utter
extinction
of
slavery
to
enact
prohibiting
the
slave
traffic
and
at
the
same
time
tempt
avarice
by
the
allurements
of
an
is
irreconcilable
and
absurd
to
my
great
surprise
i
find
that
the
free
states
of
ohio
and
indiana
disgrace
themselves
by
admitting
the
same
maxim
of
law
which
prevents
any
black
or
mulatto
from
being
a
witness
against
a
white
man
it
is
naturally
supposed
that
free
negroes
will
sympathize
with
their
enslaved
brethren
and
that
notwithstanding
all
exertions
to
the
contrary
they
will
become
a
little
more
intelligent
this
excites
a
peculiar
jealousy
and
hatred
in
the
white
population
of
which
it
is
impossible
to
enumerate
all
the
hardships
even
in
the
slaves
are
always
mentioned
before
free
people
of
color
so
desirous
are
they
to
degrade
the
latter
class
below
the
level
of
the
former
to
complete
the
wrong
this
unhappy
class
are
despised
in
consequence
of
the
very
evils
we
ourselves
have
induced
for
as
slavery
inevitably
makes
its
victims
servile
and
vicious
and
as
none
but
negroes
are
allowed
to
be
slaves
we
from
our
very
childhood
associate
every
thing
that
is
degraded
with
the
though
in
fact
the
object
of
our
contempt
may
be
both
exemplary
and
intelligent
in
this
way
the
africans
are
doubly
the
victims
of
our
injustice
and
thus
does
prejudice
the
meat
it
feeds
on
i
have
repeatedly
said
that
our
slave
laws
are
continually
increasing
in
severity
as
a
proof
of
this
i
will
give
a
brief
view
of
some
of
the
most
which
have
been
passed
since
stroud
published
his
compendium
of
slave
laws
in
in
the
first
class
are
contained
those
enactments
oppressive
to
people
of
color
in
the
second
are
those
which
injure
them
by
the
penalties
or
disabilities
imposed
upon
the
whites
who
instruct
assist
or
employ
them
or
endeavor
in
any
way
to
influence
public
opinion
in
their
favor
the
legislature
of
virginia
passed
a
law
in
by
which
any
free
colored
person
who
undertakes
to
preach
or
conduct
any
religious
meeting
by
day
or
night
may
be
whipped
not
exceeding
lashes
at
the
discretion
of
justice
of
the
peace
and
any
body
may
apprehend
any
such
free
colored
person
without
a
warrant
the
same
penalty
adjudged
and
executed
in
the
same
way
falls
upon
any
slave
or
free
colored
person
who
attends
such
preaching
and
any
slave
who
listens
to
any
preacher
in
the
night
time
receives
the
same
punishment
the
same
law
prevails
in
georgia
and
mississippi
a
master
may
permit
a
slave
to
preach
on
plantation
to
none
but
slaves
there
is
a
in
the
following
preamble
to
a
law
passed
by
north
carolina
in
which
would
be
amusing
if
the
subject
were
not
too
serious
for
mirth
teaching
slaves
to
read
and
write
has
a
tendency
to
excite
dissatisfaction
in
their
and
to
produce
insurrection
and
rebellion
therefore
it
is
enacted
that
teaching
a
slave
to
read
or
write
or
giving
or
selling
to
a
slave
book
or
pamphlet
shall
be
punished
with
lashes
if
the
offender
be
a
free
black
or
with
imprisonment
at
the
discretion
of
the
court
if
a
slave
the
is
punishable
with
lashes
on
his
or
her
bare
back
on
conviction
before
a
justice
of
the
peace
in
georgia
any
slave
or
free
person
of
color
is
for
a
similar
offence
fined
or
whipped
or
fined
whipped
at
the
discretion
of
the
court
in
louisiana
twelve
months
imprisonment
is
the
penalty
for
teaching
a
slave
to
read
or
write
for
publishing
or
circulating
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
any
pamphlet
or
paper
having
an
to
excite
slaves
or
free
persons
of
color
to
insurrection
or
resistance
imprisonment
not
less
than
one
year
standing
in
the
pillory
whipping
at
the
discretion
of
the
court
for
the
first
offence
and
death
for
the
second
the
same
offence
punished
with
death
in
georgia
without
any
reservation
in
mississippi
the
same
as
in
georgia
in
louisiana
the
same
offence
punished
either
with
imprisonment
for
life
or
death
at
the
discretion
of
the
court
in
virginia
the
first
offence
of
this
sort
is
punished
with
lashes
the
second
with
death
with
regard
to
publications
having
a
to
promote
discontent
among
slaves
their
masters
are
so
very
jealous
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
book
that
would
not
come
under
their
condemnation
the
bible
and
the
declaration
of
independence
are
certainly
unsafe
the
preamble
to
the
north
carolina
law
declares
that
the
has
a
tendency
to
excite
dissatisfaction
i
suppose
it
is
because
may
be
spelt
out
of
it
a
storekeeper
in
south
carolina
was
nearly
ruined
by
having
unconsciously
imported
certain
printed
which
his
neighbors
deemed
seditious
a
friend
of
mine
asked
did
the
handkerchiefs
contain
texts
from
scripture
or
quotations
from
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
emancipated
slaves
must
quit
north
carolina
in
ninety
days
after
their
enfranchisement
on
pain
of
being
sold
for
life
free
persons
of
color
who
shall
that
state
may
be
seized
and
sold
as
runaway
slaves
and
if
they
of
the
state
for
more
than
ninety
days
they
can
never
return
under
the
same
penalty
this
extraordinary
use
of
the
word
furnishes
a
new
battering
ram
against
the
free
colored
class
which
is
every
where
so
odious
to
a
to
relations
in
another
state
may
be
called
being
taken
up
and
detained
by
over
ninety
days
may
be
called
for
where
neither
the
evidence
of
the
sufferer
nor
any
of

all

subjecting

any

there
is
a
similar
enactment
the
prohibition
is
in

confined
to

it
would
be
imprudent
to
meddle
with

any

thus
detained
and
the

of
their
he
shall
be
fined
five
hundred
dollars
and
also
imprisoned
not
exceeding
three
months
these
state
laws
are
a
direct
violation
of
the
laws
of
nations
and
our
treaties
and
may
involve
the
united
states
in
a
foreign
war
colored
seamen
are
often
employed
in
spanish
portuguese
french
and
english
vessels
these
nations
are
bound
to
know
the
united
states
laws
but
can
they
be
expected
to
know
the
enactments
of
particular
states
and
cities
and
if
they
know
them
are
they
bound
to
observe
them
if
they
interfere
with
the
established
rules
of
nations
when
wirt
pronounced
these
laws
unconstitutional
great
excitement
was
produced
in
south
carolina
the
governor
of
that
state
in
his
message
to
the
legislature
implied
that
separation
from
the
union
was
the
only
remedy
if
the
laws
of
the
southern
states
could
not
be
enforced
they
seem
to
require
unconditional
submission
abroad
as
well
as
at
home
the
endeavor
to
prevent
insurrections
in
this
way
is
as
wise
as
to
attempt
to
extinguish
fire
with
spirits
of
wine
the
policy
defeats
itself
a
free
colored
sailor
was
lately
imprisoned
with
seven
slaves
here
was
a
fine
opportunity
to
sow
the
seeds
of
sedition
in
their
minds
the
upholders
of
slavery
will
in
vain
contend
with
the
liberal
spirit
of
the
age
it
is
too
strong
for
them
they
may
as
well
try
to
bottle
up
the
sunshine
for
their
own
exclusive
use
as
to
attempt
to
keep
knowledge
and
freedom
to
themselves
we
all
know
that
such
an
experiment
would
result
in
bottling
up
darkness
for
themselves
while
exactly
the
same
amount
of
sunshine
remained
abroad
for
the
use
of
their
neighbors

this
limitation
does
not
probably
avail
much
if
sold

another

before
the
five
years
expired
they
would
never
be
likely
to
be

again
several

is
worthy
of
remark
that
england
pursues
a
totally
different
course
with
regard
to
allowing
slaves
to
communicate
with
free
people
their
recent
laws
are
all
calculated
to
make
it
easy
for
the
slave
to
obtain
a
fair
hearing
from
people
who
have
no
interest
to
suppress
his
complaints
he
may
go
upon
any
plantation
and
communicate

any

whoever
tries
to
prevent
his
going

these
humane
laws
so
carefully
framed
in
favor
of
the
defenceless
have
been
found
insufficient
to
protect
the
slave
experience
proves
what
reason
clearly
points
out
that
the
force
of
good
laws
must
be
weakened
by
the
very
nature
of
this
unholy
relation
where
there
is
knowledge
and
freedom
on
one
side
and
ignorance
and
servitude
on
the
other
evasions
and
subterfuges
will
of
course
be
frequent
hence
english
philanthropists
have
universally
come
to
the
conclusion
that
nothing
effectual
can
be
done
unless
slavery
itself
be
destroyed
the
limits
of
this
work
compel
me
to
pass
by
many
enactments
in
our
slaveholding
states
which
would
throw
still
more
light
on
this
dark
subject
i
have
laid
open
some
of
the
laws
which
do
actually
exist
and
are
constantly
enforced
in
this
free
country
and
knowing
all
this
and
still
more
to
be
true
i
blush
and
hang
my
head
whenever
i
hear
any
one
boast
of
our
glorious
institutions
the
slaveholders
insist
that
their
is
so
great
as
to
render
all
their
ferocious
laws
perfectly
harmless
are
the
laws
then
made
on
purpose
to
urge
masters
to
be
so
much
worse
than
they
really
desire
to
be
the
democrats
of
the
south
appear
to
be
less
scrupulous
about
the
liberties
of
others
than
the
autocrat
of
the
russias
for
when
madame
de
staël
told
the
emperor
alexander
that
his
answered
instead
of
a
for
his
country
he
replied
then
madam
i
am
but
a
lucky
how
much
more
emphatically
may
it
be
said
that
the
slave
destiny
is
a
matter
of
chance
reader
would
you
trust
the
very
best
man
you
know
with
your
time
your
interests
your
family
and
your
life
unless
the
contract
were
guarded
on
every
side
by
the
strong
arm
of
the
law
if
a
neighbor
could
force
you
to
toil
and
could
gain
a
certain
number
of
dollars
for
every
hour
of
your
labor
how
much
rest
should
you
expect
to
have
it
is
utter
nonsense
to
say
that
generosity
of
disposition
is
a
protection
against
tyranny
where
all
the
power
is
on
one
side
it
may
be
and
it
no
doubt
is
so
in
particular
instances
but
they
must
be
exceptions
to
the
general
rule
we
all
know
that
the
southerners
have
a
high
sense
of
what
the
world
calls
honor
and
that
they
are
brave
hospitable
and
generous
to
people
of
their
own
color
but
the
more
we
respect
their
virtues
the
more
cause
is
there
to
lament
the
demoralizing
which
produces
such
unhappy
effects
on
all
who
come
within
its
baneful
influence
most
of
them
may
be
as
kind
as
can
be
expected
of
human
nature
endowed
with
almost
unlimited
power
to
do
wrong
and
some
of
them
may
be
even
more
benevolent
than
the
warmest
friend
of
the
negro
would
dare
to
hope
but
while
we
admit
all
this
we
must
not
forget
that
there
is
in
every
community
a
class
of
men
who
will
not
be
any
better
than
the
laws
compel
them
to
be
captain
riley
in
his
narrative
says
strange
as
it
may
seem
to
the
philanthropist
my
free
and
countrymen
still
hold
a
million
and
a
half
t
of
human
beings
in
the
most
cruel
bonds
of
slavery
who
are
kept
at
hard
labor
and
smarting
under
the
lash
of
inhuman
mercenary
drivers
in
many
instances
enduring
the
miseries
of
hunger
thirst
imprisonment
cold
nakedness
and
even
tortures
this
is
no
picture
of
the
imagination
for
the
honor
of
human
nature
i
wish
likenesses
were
nowhere
to
be
found
i
myself
have
witnessed
such
scenes
in
different
parts
of
my
own
country
and
the
bare
recollection
of
them
now
chills
my
blood
with
horror
footnote
t
there
are
now
over
two
million
when
the
talk
of
their
gentleness
and
compassion
they
are
witnesses
in
their
own
favor
and
have
strong
motives
for
showing
the
fairest
side
but
what
do
the
laws
themselves
imply
are
enactments
ever
made
against
exigencies
which
do
not
exist
if
negroes
have
never
been
scalded
burned
mutilated
why
are
such
crimes
forbidden
by
an
express
law
with
the
marvellous
proviso
except
said
slave
of
punishment
if
a
law
sanctioning
whipping
to
any
extent
incarceration
at
the
discretion
of
the
master
and
the
body
loaded
with
irons
is
called
a
law
let
me
ask
what
crimes
must
have
been
committed
to
require
where
so
much
is
the
law
which
declares
that
slaves
shall
be
compelled
to
labor
fourteen
or
fifteen
hours
a
day
has
the
following
preamble
whereas
owners
of
slaves
managers
confine
them
so
closely
to
hard
labor
that
they
have
not
sufficient
time
for
natural
rest
pinckney
in
a
public
argument
speaking
of
slaves
murdered
by
severe
treatment
says
the
of
the
crime
is
no
doubt
owing
to
the
nature
of
the
punishment
the
reader
will
observe
that
i
carefully
refrain
from
quoting
the
representations
of
party
spirit
and
refer
to
only
for
evidence
where
the
laws
are
made
by
the
people
a
majority
of
course
approve
them
else
they
would
soon
be
changed
it
must
therefore
in
candor
be
admitted
that
the
of
a
state
speak
the
prevailing
of
the
inhabitants
judging
by
this
rule
what
inference
must
be
drawn
from
the
facts
stated
above
at
sparta
the
freeman
is
the
freest
of
all
men
and
the
slave
is
the
greatest
of
slaves
our
republic
is
a
perfect
pandora
box
to
the
negro
only
there
is
no
at
the
bottom
the
wretchedness
of
his
fate
is
not
a
little
increased
by
being
a
constant
witness
of
the
unbounded
freedom
enjoyed
by
others
the
slave
labor
must
necessarily
be
like
the
labor
of
sisiphus
and
here
the
torments
of
tantalus
are
added
slavery
is
so
inconsistent
with
free
institutions
and
the
spirit
of
liberty
is
so
contagious
under
such
institutions
that
the
system
must
either
be
given
up
or
sustained
by
laws
outrageously
severe
hence
we
find
that
our
slave
laws
have
each
year
been
growing
more
harsh
than
those
of
any
other
nation
shall
i
be
told
that
all
these
regulations
are
necessary
for
the
white
man
safety
what
then
let
me
indignantly
ask
what
must
the
system
be
that
to
be
supported
by
such
unnatural
such
tyrannical
means
the
very
apology
pronounces
the
condemnation
of
slavery
for
it
proves
that
it
can
not
exist
without
producing
boundless
misery
to
the
oppressed

oppressor
in
our
fourth
of
july
orations
we
are
much
in
the
habit
of
talking
about
the
tyranny
of
england
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
broad
and
deep
stains
do
rest
upon
her
history
but
there
is
a
vulgar
proverb
that
those
who
live
in
glass
houses
should
not
throw
stones
in
judging
of
national
as
well
as
individual
wrong
it
is
fair
to
consider
the
amount
of
temptation
england
has
had
power
more
extensive
and
permanent
than
any
nation
since
the
decline
of
rome
the
negroes
and
the
indians
are
the
only
people
who
have
been
dependant
on
justice
and
generosity
and
how
have
we
treated
it
is
a
favorite
argument
that
we
are
not
to
blame
for
slavery
because
the
british
engrafted
it
upon
us
while
we
were
colonies
but
did
we
not
take
the
liberty
to
english
laws
and
customs
when
they
did
not
suit
us
why
not
put
away
as
well
as
other
evils
of
much
less
consequence
it
could
have
been
done
easily
at
the
time
of
our
confederation
it
be
done
have
not
other
nations
been
making
alterations
for
the
better
on
this
very
subject
since
we
became
independent
is
not
england
trying
with
all
her
might
to
atone
for
the
wrong
she
has
done
does
not
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
constitution
of
each
individual
state
make
provision
for
such
changes
as
shall
tend
to
the
public
good
the
plain
truth
is
the
continuation
of
this
system
is
a
sin
and
the
sin
rests
upon
us
it
has
been
eloquently
said
that
by
this
excuse
we
try
to
throw
the
blame
upon
our
ancestors
and
leave
repentance
to
posterity

and

principles

of
which
has
been
proved
by
reason
and
experience

produce
the
greatest
possible
happiness
to
the
greatest
number
of
people
all
writers
of
this
class
i
believe
without
exception
prefer
free
labor
to
slave
labor
indeed
a
very
brief
glance
will
show
that
slavery
is
inconsistent
with
whether
domestic
or
political
the
slave
is
bought
sometimes
at
a
very
high
price
in
free
labor
there
is
no
such
investment
of
capital
when
the
slave
is
ill
a
physician
must
be
paid
by
the
owner
the
free
laborer
defrays
his
own
expenses
the
children
of
the
slave
must
be
supported
by
his
master
the
free
man
maintains
his
own
the
slave
is
to
be
taken
care
of
in
his
old
age
which
his
previous
habits
render
peculiarly
helpless
the
free
laborer
is
hired
when
he
is
wanted
and
then
returns
to
his
home
the
slave
does
not
care
how
slowly
or
carelessly
he
works
it
is
the
free
interest
to
do
his
business
well
and
quickly
the
slave
is
indifferent
how
many
tools
he
spoils
the
free
man
has
a
motive
to
be
careful
the
slave
clothing
is
indeed
very
cheap
but
it
is
of
no
consequence
to
him
how
fast
it
is
destroyed
his
master
keep
him
covered
and
that
is
all
he
is
likely
to
do
the
hired
laborer
pays
more
for
his
garments
but
makes
them
last
three
times
as
long
the
free
man
will
be
honest
for
reputation
sake
but
reputation
will
make
the
slave
none
the
richer
nor
invest
him
with
any
of
the
privileges
of
a
human
being
while
his
poverty
and
sense
of
wrong
both
urge
him
to
steal
from
his
master
a
salary
must
be
paid
to
an
overseer
to
compel
the
slave
to
work
the
free
man
is
impelled
by
the
desire
of
increasing
the
comforts
of
himself
and
family
two
hired
laborers
will
perform
as
much
work
as
three
slaves
by
some
it
is
supposed
to
be
a
more
correct
estimate
that
slaves
perform
only
as
much
labor
as
the
same
number
of
free
laborers
finally
slaves
are
employed
manual
industry
is
a
degradation
to
white
people
and
indolence
becomes
the
prevailing
characteristic
have
indeed
frequently
shown
great
adroitness
in
defending
this
bad
system
but
with
few
exceptions
they
base
their
arguments
upon
the
necessity
of
continuing
slavery
because
it
is
already
begun
many
of
them
have
openly
acknowledged
that
it
was
highly
injurious
to
the
prosperity
of
the
state
the
hon
henry
clay
in
his
address
before
the
colonization
society
of
kentucky
has
given
a
view
of
the
causes
affecting
and
likely
to
affect
slavery
in
this
country
which
is
very
remarkable
for
its
completeness
its
distinctness
and
its
brevity
the
following
sentences
are
quoted
from
this
address
as
a
mere
laborer
the
slave
feels
that
he
toils
for
his
master
and
not
for
himself
that
the
laws
do
not
recognise
his
capacity
to
acquire
and
hold
property
which
depends
altogether
upon
the
pleasure
of
his
proprietor
and
that
all
the
fruits
of
his
exertions
are
reaped
by
others
he
knows
that
whether
sick
or
well
in
times
of
scarcity
or
abundance
his
master
is
bound
to
provide
for
him
by
the
influence
of
he
is
generally
therefore
indifferent
to
the
adverse
or
prosperous
fortunes
of
his
master
being
contented
if
he
can
escape
his
displeasure
or
chastisement
by
a
careless
and
slovenly
performance
of
his
duties
this
is
the
state
of
the
relation
between
master
and
slave
prescribed
by
the
law
of
its
nature
and
founded
in
the
reason
of
things
there
are
undoubtedly
many
exceptions
in
which
the
slave
dedicates
himself
to
his
master
with
a
zealous
and
generous
devotion
and
the
master
to
the
slave
with
a
parental
and
affectionate
attachment
but
it
is
my
purpose
to
speak
of
the
state
of
this
unfortunate
relation
that
labor
is
best
in
which
the
laborer
knows
that
he
will
derive
the
profits
of
his
industry
that
his
employment
depends
upon
his
diligence
and
his
reward
upon
this
assiduity
he
then
has
every
motive
to
excite
him
to
exertion
and
to
animate
him
in
perseverance
he
knows
that
if
he
is
treated
badly
he
can
exchange
his
employer
for
one
who
will
better
estimate
his
service
and
that
whatever
he
earns
is
to
be
distributed
by
himself
as
he
pleases
among
his
wife
and
children
and
friends
or
enjoyed
by
himself
in
a
word
he
feels
that
he
is
a
free
agent
with
rights
and
privileges
and
sensibilities
wherever
the
option
exists
to
employ
at
an
equal
hire
free
or
slave
labor
the
former
will
be
decidedly
preferred
for
the
reasons
already
assigned
it
is
more
capable
more
diligent
more
faithful
and
in
every
respect
more
worthy
of
confidence
it
is
believed
that
nowhere
in
the
portion
of
the
united
states
would
slave
labor
be
generally
employed
if
the
proprietor
were
not
tempted
to
raise
slaves
by
the
high
price
of
the
southern
market
which
keeps
it
up
in
his
own
speaking
of
an
attempt
more
than
years
ago
to
adopt
gradual
emancipation
in
kentucky
clay
says
we
were
overpowered
by
numbers
and
submitted
to
the
decision
of
the
majority
with
the
grace
which
the
minority
in
a
republic
should
ever
yield
to
such
a
decision
i
have
nevertheless
never
ceased
and
never
shall
cease
to
regret
a
decision
the
effects
of
which
have
been
to
place
us
in
the
rear
of
our
neighbors
who
are
exempt
from
slavery
in
the
state
of
agriculture
the
progress
of
manufactures
the
advance
of
improvement
and
the
general
prosperity
of
society
appleton
in
his
reply
to
mcduffie
in
the
winter
of
a
speech
distinguished
for
its
good
temper
and
sound
practical
sense
says
i
do
not
think
the
gentleman
from
south
carolina
has
overrated
the
money
price
of
labor
at
fifty
cents
but
most
of
the
labor
is
performed
by
the
of
the
it
is
great
industry
alone
which
makes
prosperous
the
circumstance
that
with
this
cheap
slave
labor
the
south
is
complaining
of
suffering
while
the
north
is
content
and
prosperous
with
dear
free
labor
is
a
striking
fact
and
deserves
a
careful
and
thorough
examination
the
experience
of
all
ages
and
nations
proves
that
high
wages
are
the
most
powerful
stimulus
to
exertion
and
the
best
means
of
attaching
the
people
to
the
institutions
under
which
they
live
it
is
apparent
that
this
political
effect
upon
the
character
of
society
can
not
have
any
action
upon
slaves
having
no
choice
or
volition
there
is
nothing
for
stimulus
to
act
upon
they
are
in
fact
no
part
of
society
so
that
in
the
language
of
political
economy
they
are
like
machinery
merely
capital
and
the
productions
of
their
labor
consists
wholly
of
profits
of
capital
but
it
is
not
perceived
how
the
tariff
can
lessen
the
value
of
the
productions
of
their
labor
in
comparison
with
that
of
the
other
states
and
virginia
both
produce
wheat
with
dear
labor
is
content
and
virginia
with
cheap
labor
is
dissatisfied
what
is
the
of
the
white
population
of
the
planting
states
i
am
at
a
loss
to
know
how
this
population
is
employed
we
hear
of
no
products
of
these
states
but
those
produced
by
slave
labor
it
is
clear
the
white
population
can
not
be
employed
in
raising
cotton
or
tobacco
because
in
doing
so
they
can
earn
but
twelve
and
a
half
cents
per
day
since
the
same
quantity
of
labor
performed
by
a
slave
is
worth
no
more
i
am
told
also
that
the
wages
of
overseers
mechanics
are
higher
than
the
white
labor
of
the
north
and
it
is
well
known
that
many
mechanics
go
from
the
north
to
the
south
to
get
employment
during
the
winter
these
facts
suggest
the
inquiry
whether
this
cheap
slave
labor
does
not
paralyze
the
industry
of
the
whites
whether
is
not
the
greatest
of
their
evils
during
the
famous
debate
in
the
virginia
legislature
in
the
winter
of
brodnax
made
the
following
remark
that
slavery
in
virginia
is
an
evil
and
a
transcendent
evil
it
would
be
more
than
idle
for
any
human
being
to
doubt
or
deny
it
is
a
mildew
which
has
blighted
every
region
it
has
touched
from
the
creation
of
the
world
illustrations
from
the
history
of
other
countries
and
other
times
might
be
instructive
and
profitable
had
we
the
time
to
review
them
but
we
have
evidence
tending
to
the
same
conviction
nearer
at
hand
and
accessible
to
daily
observation
in
the
short
histories
of
the
different
states
of
this
great
confederacy
which
are
impressive
in
their
admonitions
and
conclusive
in
their
character
during
the
same
session
faulkner
of
virginia
said
sir
i
am
gratified
to
perceive
that
no
gentleman
has
yet
risen
in
this
hall
the
avowed
of
slavery
the
day
has
gone
by
when
such
a
voice
could
be
listened
to
with
patience
or
even
forbearance
i
even
regret
sir
that
we
should
find
one
amongst
us
who
enters
the
lists
as
its
except
on
the
ground
of
uncontrolable
necessity
if
there
be
one
who
concurs
with
the
gentleman
from
brunswick
gholson
in
the
harmless
character
of
this
institution
let
me
request
him
to
compare
the
condition
of
the
slaveholding
portion
of
this
commonwealth
barren
desolate
and
seared
as
it
were
by
the
avenging
hand
of
heaven
with
the
descriptions
which
we
have
of
this
same
country
from
those
who
first
broke
its
virgin
soil
to
what
is
this
change
ascribable
alone
to
the
withering
and
blasting
effects
of
slavery
if
this
does
not
satisfy
him
let
me
request
him
to
extend
his
travels
to
the
northern
states
of
this
union
and
beg
him
to
contrast
the
happiness
and
contentment
which
prevails
throughout
the
country
the
busy
and
cheerful
sounds
of
industry
the
rapid
and
swelling
growth
of
their
population
their
means
and
institutions
of
education
their
skill
and
proficiency
in
the
useful
arts
their
enterprise
and
public
spirit
the
monuments
of
their
commercial
and
manufacturing
industry
and
above
all
their
devoted
attachment
to
the
government
from
which
they
derive
their
protection
with
the
division
discontent
indolence
and
poverty
of
the
southern
country
to
what
sir
is
all
this
ascribable
to
that
vice
in
the
organization
of
society
by
which
one
half
of
its
inhabitants
are
arrayed
in
interest
and
feeling
against
the
other
half
to
that
unfortunate
state
of
society
in
which
freemen
regard
labor
as
disgraceful
and
slaves
shrink
from
it
as
a
burden
tyranically
imposed
upon
them
to
that
condition
of
things
in
which
half
a
million
of
your
population
can
feel
no
sympathy
with
the
society
in
the
prosperity
of
which
they
are
forbidden
to
participate
and
no
attachment
to
a
government
at
whose
hands
they
receive
nothing
but
injustice
if
this
should
not
be
sufficient
and
the
curious
and
incredulous
inquirer
should
suggest
that
the
contrast
which
has
been
adverted
to
and
is
so
manifest
might
be
traced
to
a
difference
of
climate
or
other
causes
distinct
from
slavery
itself
permit
me
to
refer
him
to
the
two
states
of
kentucky
and
ohio
no
difference
of
soil
no
diversity
of
climate
no
diversity
in
the
original
settlement
of
those
two
states
can
account
for
the
remarkable
disproportion
in
their
national
advancement
separated
by
a
river
alone
they
seem
to
have
been
purposely
and
providentially
designed
to
exhibit
in
their
future
histories
the
difference
which
necessarily
results
from
a
country
free
from
and
a
country
afflicted
with
the
curse
of
slavery
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
two
states
of
missouri
and
illinois
slavery
it
is
admitted
is
an
evil
it
is
an
institution
which
presses
heavily
against
the
best
interests
of
the
state
it
banishes
free
white
labor
it
exterminates
the
mechanic
the
artisan
the
manufacturer
it
deprives
them
of
occupation
it
deprives
them
of
bread
it
converts
the
energy
of
a
community
into
indolence
its
power
into
imbecility
its
efficiency
into
weakness
sir
being
thus
injurious
have
we
not
a
right
to
demand
its
extermination
shall
society
suffer
that
the
slaveholder
may
continue
to
gather
his
of
human
flesh
what
is
his
mere
pecuniary
claim
compared
with
the
great
interests
of
the
common
weal
must
the
country
languish
and
die
that
the
slaveholder
may
flourish
shall
all
interest
be
subservient
to
one
all
rights
subordinate
to
those
of
the
slaveholder
has
not
the
mechanic
have
not
the
middle
classes
their
rights
rights
incompatible
with
the
existence
of
slavery
sutcliff
in
his
travels
in
north
america
says
a
person
not
conversant
with
these
things
would
naturally
think
that
where
families
employ
a
number
of
slaves
every
thing
about
their
houses
gardens
and
plantations
would
be
kept
in
the
best
order
but
the
reverse
of
this
is
generally
the
case
i
was
sometimes
tempted
to
think
that
the
more
slaves
there
were
employed
the
more
disorder
appeared
i
am
persuaded
that
one
or
two
hired
servants
in
a
family
would
preserve
more
neatness
order
and
comfort
than
treble
the
number
of
slaves
there
is
a
very
striking
contrast
between
the
appearance
of
the
horses
or
teams
in
pennsylvania
and
those
in
the
southern
states
where
slaves
are
kept
in
pennsylvania
we
meet
with
great
numbers
of
wagons
drawn
by
four
or
more
fine
fat
horses
the
carriages
firm
and
well
made
and
covered
with
stout
good
linen
bleached
almost
white
and
it
is
not
uncommon
to
see
ten
or
fifteen
together
travelling
cheerfully
along
the
road
the
driver
riding
on
one
of
his
horses
many
of
these
come
more
than
three
hundred
miles
to
philadelphia
from
the
ohio
pittsburg
and
other
places
and
i
have
been
told
by
a
respectable
friend
a
native
of
philadelphia
that
more
than
one
thousand
covered
carriages
frequently
come
to
philadelphia
market
the
appearance
of
things
in
the
slave
states
is
quite
the
reverse
of
this
we
sometimes
meet
a
ragged
black
boy
or
girl
driving
a
team
consisting
of
a
lean
cow
or
a
mule
sometimes
a
lean
bull
or
an
ox
and
a
mule
and
i
have
seen
a
mule
a
bull
and
a
cow
each
miserable
in
its
appearance
composing
one
team
with
a
black
slave
or
two
riding
or
driving
as
occasion
suited
the
carriage
or
wagon
if
it
may
be
called
such
appeared
in
as
wretched
a
condition
as
the
team
and
its
driver
sometimes
a
couple
of
horses
mules
or
cows
would
be
dragging
a
hogshead
of
tobacco
with
a
pivot
or
axle
driven
into
each
end
of
the
hogshead
and
something
like
a
shaft
attached
by
which
it
was
drawn
or
rolled
along
the
road
i
have
seen
two
oxen
and
two
slaves
pretty
fully
employed
in
getting
along
a
single
hogshead
and
some
of
these
come
from
a
great
distance
inland
the
inhabitants
of
free
states
are
often
told
that
they
can
not
argue
fairly
upon
the
subject
of
slavery
because
they
know
nothing
about
its
actual
operation
and
any
expression
of
their
opinions
and
feelings
with
regard
to
the
system
is
attributed
to
ignorant
enthusiasm
fanatical
benevolence
or
a
wicked
intention
to
do
mischief
but
clay
brodnax
and
faulkner
belong
to
slaveholding
states
and
the
two
former
if
i
mistake
not
are
surely
are
qualified
to
judge
of
the
system
and
i
might
fill
ten
pages
with
other
quotations
from
southern
writers
and
speakers
who
acknowledge
that
slavery
is
a
great
evil
there
are
zealous
partisans
indeed
who
defend
the
system
strenuously
and
some
of
them
very
eloquently
thus
hayne
in
his
reply
to
webster
denied
that
the
south
suffered
in
consequence
of
he
maintained
that
the
slaveholding
states
were
prosperous
and
the
principal
cause
of
all
the
prosperity
in
the
union
he
laughed
at
the
idea
of
any
danger
however
distant
from
an
overgrown
slave
population
and
supported
the
position
by
the
fact
that
slaves
had
always
been
kept
in
entire
subjection
in
the
british
west
indies
where
the
white
population
is
less
than
ten
per
cent
of
the
whole
but
the
distinguished
gentleman
from
south
carolina
did
not
mention
that
the
establishment
of
the
british
west
indies
costs
england
million
pounds
yet
such
is
the
fact
this
system
is
so
closely
entwined
with
the
apparent
interests
and
convenience
of
individuals
that
it
will
never
want
for
able
defenders
so
long
as
it
exists
but
i
believe
i
do
not
misrepresent
the
truth
when
i
say
the
prevailing
opinion
at
the
south
is
that
it
would
have
been
much
better
for
those
states
and
for
the
country
in
general
if
slavery
had
never
been
introduced
miss
martineau
in
her
most
admirable
little
book
on
demerara
says
labor
is
the
product
of
mind
as
much
as
of
body
and
to
secure
that
product
we
must
sway
the
mind
by
the
natural
means
by
motives
laboring
against
is
what
nobody
ought
to
expect
of
white
men
much
less
of
slaves
of
course
every
man
woman
and
child
would
rather
play
for
nothing
than
work
for
nothing
it
is
the
mind
which
gives
sight
to
the
eye
and
hearing
to
the
ear
and
strength
to
the
limbs
and
the
mind
can
not
be
purchased
where
a
man
is
allowed
the
possession
of
himself
the
purchaser
of
his
labor
is
benefitted
by
the
vigor
of
his
mind
through
the
service
of
his
limbs
where
man
is
made
the
possession
of
another
the
possessor
loses
at
once
and
for
ever
all
that
is
most
valuable
in
that
for
which
he
has
paid
the
price
of
crime
he
becomes
the
owner
of
that
which
only
differs
from
an
idiot
in
being
less
easily
drilled
into
habits
and
more
capable
of
effectual
revenge
cattle
are
fixed
capital
and
so
are
slaves
but
slaves
differ
from
cattle
on
the
one
hand
in
yielding
from
internal
opposition
a
less
return
for
their
maintenance
and
from
free
laborers
on
the
other
hand
in
not
being
acted
upon
by
the
inducements
which
stimulate
production
as
an
effort
of
mind
as
well
as
of
body
in
all
three
cases
the
labor
is
purchased
in
free
laborers
and
cattle
all
the
faculties
work
together
and
to
advantage
in
the
slave
they
are
opposed
and
therefore
he
is
so
far
as
the
amount
of
labor
is
concerned
the
least
valuable
of
the
three
the
negroes
invent
and
improve
witness
their
ingenuity
in
their
dwellings
and
their
skill
in
certain
of
their
sports
but
their
masters
will
never
possess
their
faculties
though
they
have
purchased
their
limbs
our
true
policy
would
be
to
divide
the
work
of
the
slave
between
the
ox
and
the
hired
laborer
we
should
get
more
out
of
the
sinews
of
the
one
and
the
soul
of
the
other
than
the
produce
of
double
the
number
of
slaves
as
a
matter
of
humanity
let
it
be
remembered
that
men
having
more
than
brutes
must
be
treated
with
much
greater
severity
in
order
to
keep
them
in
a
state
of
abject
submission
it
seems
unnecessary
to
say
that
what
is
unjust
and
unmerciful
can
never
be
expedient
yet
men
often
write
talk
and
act
as
if
they
either
forgot
this
truth
or
doubted
it
there
is
genuine
wisdom
in
the
following
remark
extracted
from
the
petition
of
cambridge
university
to
the
parliament
of
england
on
the
subject
of
slavery
a
firm
belief
in
the
providence
of
a
benevolent
creator
assures
us
that
no
system
founded
on
the
oppression
of
one
part
of
mankind
be
beneficial
to
another
but
the
tolerator
of
slavery
will
say
no
doubt
the
system
is
an
evil
but
we
are
not
to
blame
for
it
we
received
it
from
our
english
ancestors
it
is
a
lamentable
we
can
not
do
it
away
if
we
would
insurrections
would
be
the
inevitable
result
of
any
attempt
to
remove
it
and
having
quieted
their
consciences
by
the
use
of
the
word
they
think
no
more
upon
the
subject
these
assertions
have
been
so
often
and
so
dogmatically
repeated
that
many
truly
people
have
believed
there
was
some
truth
in
them
i
myself
may
god
forgive
me
for
it
have
often
in
thoughtless
ignorance
made
the
same
remarks
an
impartial
and
careful
examination
has
led
me
to
the
conviction
that
slavery
causes
insurrections
while
emancipation
prevents
them
the
grand
argument
of
the
slaveholder
is
that
sudden
freedom
occasioned
the
horrible
massacres
of
st
if
a
word
is
said
in
favor
of
abolition
he
shakes
his
head
and
points
a
warning
finger
to
domingo
but
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
that
this
same
vilified
island
furnishes
a
strong
argument
the
lamentable
necessity
of
slavery
in
the
first
place
there
was
a
bloody
civil
war
there
before
the
act
of
emancipation
was
passed
in
the
second
place
enfranchisement
produced
the
most
blessed
effects
in
the
third
place
no
difficulties
whatever
arose
until
bonaparte
made
his
atrocious
attempt
to
in
the
island
colonel
malenfant
a
slave
proprietor
resident
in
domingo
at
the
time
thus
describes
the
effect
of
sudden
enfranchisement
in
his
historical
and
political
memoir
of
the
colonies
after
this
public
act
of
emancipation
the
negroes
remained
quiet
both
in
the
south
and
in
the
west
and
they
continued
to
work
upon
all
the
plantations
there
were
estates
which
had
neither
owners
nor
managers
resident
upon
them
yet
upon
these
estates
though
abandoned
the
negroes
continued
their
labors
where
there
were
any
even
inferior
agents
to
guide
them
and
on
those
estates
where
no
white
men
were
left
to
direct
them
they
betook
themselves
to
the
planting
of
provisions
but
upon
all
the
plantations
where
the
whites
resided
the
blacks
continued
to
labor
as
quietly
as
before
colonel
malenfant
says
that
when
many
of
his
neighbors
proprietors
or
managers
were
in
prison
the
negroes
of
their
plantations
came
to
him
to
beg
him
to
direct
them
in
their
work
he
adds
if
you
will
take
care
not
to
talk
to
them
of
the
restoration
of
slavery
but
to
talk
to
them
of
freedom
you
may
with
this
word
chain
them
down
to
their
labor
how
did
toussaint
succeed
how
did
i
succeed
before
his
time
in
the
plain
of
the
on
the
plantation
gouraud
during
more
than
eight
months
after
liberty
had
been
granted
to
the
slaves
let
those
who
knew
me
at
that
time
let
the
blacks
themselves
be
asked
they
will
all
reply
that
not
a
single
negro
upon
that
plantation
consisting
of
more
than
four
hundred
and
fifty
laborers
refused
to
work
and
yet
this
plantation
was
thought
to
be
under
the
worst
discipline
and
the
slaves
the
most
idle
of
any
in
the
plain
i
inspired
the
same
activity
into
three
other
plantations
of
which
i
had
the
management
if
all
the
negroes
had
come
from
africa
within
six
months
if
they
had
the
love
of
independence
that
the
indians
have
i
should
own
that
force
must
be
employed
but
out
of
a
hundred
of
the
blacks
are
aware
that
without
labor
they
can
not
procure
the
things
that
are
necessary
for
them
that
there
is
no
other
method
of
satisfying
their
wants
and
their
tastes
they
know
that
they
must
work
they
wish
to
do
so
and
they
will
do
so
such
was
the
conduct
of
the
negroes
for
the
first
nine
months
after
their
liberation
or
up
to
the
middle
of
in
the
latter
part
of
malenfant
says
the
colony
was
flourishing
under
toussaint
the
whites
lived
happily
and
in
peace
upon
their
estates
and
the
negroes
continued
to
work
for
them
general
lecroix
who
published
his
memoirs
for
a
history
of
domingo
in
says
that
in
the
most
wonderful
progress
had
been
made
in
agriculture
the
colony
says
he
marched
as
by
enchantment
towards
its
ancient
splendor
cultivation
prospered
every
day
produced
perceptible
proof
of
its
progress
general
vincent
u
who
was
a
general
of
brigade
of
artillery
in
domingo
and
a
proprietor
of
estates
in
the
island
was
sent
by
toussaint
to
paris
in
to
lay
before
the
directory
the
new
constitution
which
had
been
agreed
upon
in
domingo
he
arrived
in
france
just
at
the
moment
of
the
peace
of
amiens
and
found
that
bonaparte
was
preparing
an
armament
for
the
purpose
of
restoring
slavery
in
domingo
he
remonstrated
against
the
expedition
he
stated
that
it
was
totally
unnecessary
and
therefore
criminal
for
every
thing
was
going
on
well
in
domingo
the
proprietors
were
in
peaceable
possession
of
their
estates
cultivation
was
making
rapid
progress
the
blacks
were
industrious
and
beyond
example
happy
he
conjured
him
therefore
not
to
reverse
this
beautiful
state
of
things
but
his
efforts
were
ineffectual
and
the
expedition
arrived
upon
the
shores
of
domingo
at
length
however
the
french
were
driven
from
the
island
till
that
time
the
planters
had
retained
their
property
and
then
it
was
and
not
till
then
that
they
lost
their
all
in
dessalines
was
proclaimed
emperor
in
process
of
time
a
great
part
of
the
black
troops
were
disbanded
and
returned
to
cultivation
again
from
that
time
to
this
there
has
been
no
want
of
subordination
or
industry
among
them
footnote
u
clarkson
thoughts
p
the
following
account
of
hayti
at
a
later
period
is
quoted
from
harvey
sketches
of
that
island
during
the
latter
part
of
the
reign
of
christophé
those
who
by
their
exertions
and
economy
were
enabled
to
procure
small
spots
of
land
of
their
own
or
to
hold
the
smaller
plantations
at
an
annual
rent
were
diligently
engaged
in
cultivating
coffee
sugar
and
other
articles
which
they
disposed
of
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
adjacent
towns
and
villages
it
was
an
interesting
sight
to
behold
this
class
of
the
haytians
now
in
possession
of
their
freedom
coming
in
groups
to
the
market
nearest
which
they
resided
bringing
the
produce
of
their
industry
for
sale
and
afterwards
returning
carrying
back
the
necessary
articles
of
living
which
the
disposal
of
their
commodities
had
enabled
them
to
purchase
all
evidently
cheerful
and
happy
nor
could
it
fail
to
occur
to
the
mind
that
their
present
condition
furnished
the
most
satisfactory
answer
to
that
objection
to
the
general
emancipation
of
slaves
founded
on
their
alleged
unfitness
to
value
and
improve
the
benefits
of
liberty
though
of
the
same
race
and
possessing
the
same
general
traits
of
character
as
the
negroes
of
the
other
west
india
islands
they
are
already
distinguished
from
them
by
habits
of
industry
and
activity
such
as
slaves
are
seldom
known
to
exhibit
as
they
would
not
suffer
so
they
do
not
require
the
attendance
of
one
acting
in
the
capacity
of
a
driver
with
the
instrument
of
punishment
in
his
hand
in
guadaloupe
the
conduct
of
the
freed
negroes
was
equally
satisfactory
the
perfect
subordination
which
was
established
and
the
industry
which
prevailed
there
are
proved
by
the
official
reports
of
the
governor
of
guadaloupe
to
the
french
government
in
liberty
was
proclaimed
universally
to
the
slaves
in
that
island
and
during
their
ten
years
of
freedom
their
governors
bore
testimony
to
their
regular
industry
and
uninterrupted
submission
to
the
laws
during
the
first
american
war
a
number
of
slaves
ran
away
from
their
north
american
masters
and
joined
the
british
army
when
peace
came
it
was
determined
to
give
them
their
liberty
and
to
settle
them
in
nova
scotia
upon
grants
of
land
as
british
subjects
and
as
free
men
their
number
comprehending
men
women
and
children
was
two
thousand
and
upwards
some
of
them
worked
upon
little
portions
of
land
as
their
own
others
worked
as
carpenters
others
became
fishermen
and
others
worked
for
hire
in
various
ways
in
time
having
embraced
christianity
they
raised
places
of
worship
of
their
own
and
had
ministers
of
their
own
from
their
own
body
they
led
a
harmless
life
and
gained
the
character
of
an
industrious
and
honest
people
from
their
white
neighbors
a
few
years
afterwards
the
land
in
nova
scotia
being
found
too
poor
to
answer
and
the
climate
too
cold
for
their
constitutions
a
number
of
them
to
the
amount
of
between
thirteen
and
fourteen
hundred
volunteered
to
form
a
new
colony
which
was
then
first
thought
of
at
sierra
leone
to
which
place
they
were
accordingly
conveyed
many
hundreds
of
the
negroes
who
had
formed
the
west
indian
black
regiments
were
removed
in
to
sierra
leone
where
they
were
set
at
liberty
at
once
and
founded
the
villages
of
waterloo
hastings
and
others
several
hundred
maroons
runaway
slaves
and
their
descendants
being
exiled
from
jamaica
were
removed
in
to
sierra
leone
where
they
were
landed
with
no
other
property
than
the
clothes
which
they
wore
and
the
muskets
which
they
carried
in
their
hands
a
body
of
revolted
slaves
were
banished
from
barbadoes
in
and
sent
also
to
sierra
leone
the
rest
of
the
population
of
this
colony
consists
almost
entirely
of
negroes
who
have
been
recaptured
from
slave
ships
and
brought
to
sierra
leone
in
the
lowest
state
of
misery
debility
and
degradation
naked
diseased
destitute
wholly
ignorant
of
the
english
language
in
this
wretched
helpless
condition
they
have
been
suddenly
made
free
and
put
into
possession
at
once
of
the
rights
and
privileges
of
british
subjects
all
these
instances
of
sudden
emancipation
have
taken
place
in
a
colony
where
the
disproportion
between
black
and
white
is
more
than
a
hundred
to
one
yet
this
mixed
population
of
suddenly
emancipated
slaves
runaway
slaves
criminal
slaves
and
degraded
recaptured
negroes
are
in
their
free
condition
living
in
order
tranquillity
and
comfort
and
many
of
them
in
affluence
during
the
last
american
war
seven
hundred
and
slaves
escaped
from
their
masters
and
were
at
the
termination
of
the
war
settled
in
trinidad
as
free
laborers
where
they
are
earning
their
own
livelihood
with
industry
and
good
conduct
the
following
extract
of
a
letter
received
in
from
trinidad
by
pownall
will
show
the
usefulness
and
respectability
of
these
liberated
negroes
field
negro

but
most
of
the
work
is
done
by
free
blacks
and
people
from
the
main
at
a
much
cheaper
rate
and
as
these
are
generally
employed
by
foreigners
this
accounts
for
their
succeeding
better
than
our
own
countrymen
who
are
principally
from
the
old
islands
and
are
unaccustomed
to
any
other
management
than
that
of

however
they
are
coming
into
it

a
warm
interest

of
that

readiness

to
state
that
sudden

abrupt

would
create
disorder

distress
to
those
you
mean
to
serve
is
not
reason
but
the
plea
of
all
men
who
are
adverse
to
emancipation
as
far
as
it
can
be
ascertained
from
the
various
documents
which
have
been
cited
and
from
others
which
from
the
fear
of
making
this
account
too
long

referred

it
appears
that
in
every
place
and
time
in
which
emancipation
has
been
tried
one
drop
of
white
blood
has
been
shed
or
even
endangered
by
that
it
has
everywhere
greatly
improved
the
condition
of

in
most
places
has
removed
them
from

degradation

of
respectability

happiness

it

be
justifiable

we

not
what
evils
to
reject
this
just
salutary
and

uninjurious
measure

all

looked
upon

he
could
do

would
take
upon
himself
the
liability
of
payment
in

for
his
labor
and
provided
the
master
was
secured
against
loss
he
was
obliged
to
consent
to
the
transaction
similar
transfers
might
take
place
to
accommodate
the
master
but
never
without
the
consent
of
the
servant
the
law
regulated
the
allowance
of
provisions
clothing
and
if
the
negro
wished
for
more
he
might
have
it
charged
and
deducted
from
his
wages

lest
masters
should
take

of
the
improvidence
of

was
enacted
that

charges
exceeding
half
the
earnings
of

should
be

the
duties

were
defined
as
clearly
as
possible
by

laws
and
magistrates
appointed
to
enforce
them

was
entrusted
with
no
power
to
punish
in
any
manner

required
that

should
furnish

highly
important

he
declares
that
the
value
of

plantations
was
soon
increased
by
the
introduction
of

labor
no
one
was

it

made
all
over
the
world
to
sway
public
opinion
in
favor
of
universal
freedom
of
the
certain
emancipation
of
slaves
in
all
british
colonies
and
above
all
the
evident
union
of
purpose
existing
between
the
french
and
english
cabinets
i
can
most
plainly
see
the
hand
of
god
working
for
the
deliverance
of
the
negroes
we
may
resist
the
blessed
influence
if
we
will
but
we
can
not
conquer
every
year
the
plot
is
thickening
around
us
and
the
nations
of
the
earth
either
consciously
or
unconsciously
are
hastening
the
crisis
the
defenders
of
the
slave
system
are
situated
like
the
man
in
the
iron
shroud
the
walls
of
whose
prison
daily
moved
nearer
and
nearer
by
means
of
powerful
machinery
until
they
crushed
all
that
remained
within
them
but
to
return
to
the
subject
of
emancipation
nearly
every
one
of
the
states
north
of
mason
and
dixon
line
once
held
slaves
these
slaves
were
manumitted
without
bloodshed
and
there
was
no
trouble
in
making
free
colored
laborers
obey
the
laws
i
am
aware
that
this
desirable
change
must
be
attended
with
much
more
difficulty
in
the
southern
states
simply
because
the
evil
has
been
suffered
until
it
is
fearfully
overgrown
but
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
while
they
are
using
their
ingenuity
and
strength
to
sustain
it
for
the
present
the
mischief
is
increasing
more
and
more
rapidly
if
this
be
not
a
good
time
to
apply
a
remedy
when
will
be
a
better
they
must
annihilate
slavery
or
slavery
will
annihilate
them
it
seems
to
be
forgotten
that
emancipation
from
tyranny
is
not
an
emancipation
from
law
the
negro
after
he
is
made
free
is
restrained
from
the
commission
of
crimes
by
the
same
laws
which
restrain
other
citizens
if
he
steals
he
will
be
imprisoned
if
he
commits
murder
he
will
be
hung
it
will
perhaps
be
said
that
the
free
people
of
color
in
the
slave
portions
of
country
are
peculiarly
ignorant
idle
and
vicious
it
may
be
so
for
our
laws
and
our
influence
are
peculiarly
calculated
to
make
them
bad
members
of
society
but
we
trust
the
civil
power
to
keep
in
order
the
great
mass
of
ignorant
and
vicious
foreigners
continually
pouring
into
the
country
and
if
the
laws
are
strong
enough
for
this
may
they
not
be
trusted
to
restrain
the
free
blacks
in
those
countries
where
the
slaves
codes
are
mild
where
emancipation
is
rendered
easy
and
inducements
are
offered
to
industry
insurrections
are
not
feared
and
free
people
of
color
form
a
valuable
portion
of
the
community
if
we
persist
in
acting
in
opposition
to
the
established
laws
of
nature
and
reason
how
can
we
expect
favorable
results
but
it
is
pronounced
to
change
our
policy
every
progressive
improvement
in
the
world
has
been
resisted
by
despotism
on
the
ground
that
changes
were
dangerous
the
emperor
of
austria
thinks
there
is
need
of
keeping
his
subjects
ignorant
that
good
order
may
be
preserved
but
what
he
calls
good
order
is
sacrificing
the
happiness
of
many
to
the
advancement
of
a
few
and
no
doubt
knowledge
unfavorable
to
the
continuation
of
such
a
state
of
things
it
is
precisely
so
with
the
slaveholder
he
insists
that
the
welfare
of
millions
must
be
subordinate
to
his
private
interest
or
else
all
good
order
is
destroyed
it
is
much
to
be
regretted
that
washington
enfranchised
his
slaves
in
the
manner
he
did
because
their
poverty
and
indolence
have
furnished
an
ever
ready
argument
for
those
who
are
opposed
to
emancipation
z
to
turn
slaves
adrift
in
their
old
age
unaccustomed
to
take
care
of
themselves
without
employment
and
in
a
community
where
all
the
prejudices
were
strongly
arrayed
against
free
negroes
was
certainly
an
unhappy
experiment
footnote
z
with
all
my
unbounded
reverence
for
washington
i
have
i
confess
sometimes
found
it
hard
to
forgive
him
for
not
manumitting
his
slaves
long
before
his
death
a
fact
which
has
lately
come
to
my
knowledge
gave
me
great
joy
for
it
furnishes
a
reason
for
what
had
appeared
to
me
unpardonable
it
appears
that
washington
possessed
a
gang
of
negroes
in
right
of
his
wife
with
which
his
own
negroes
had
intermarried
by
the
marriage
settlement
the
former
were
limited
in
default
of
issue
of
the
marriage
to
the
representatives
of
washington
at
her
death
so
that
her
negroes
could
not
be
enfranchised
an
unwillingness
to
separate
parents
and
children
husbands
and
wives
induced
washington
to
postpone
the
manumission
of
his
own
slaves
this
motive
is
briefly
and
as
it
were
accidentally
referred
to
in
his
will
but
if
slaves
were
allowed
to
redeem
themselves
progressively
by
purchasing
one
day
of
the
week
after
another
as
they
can
in
the
spanish
colonies
habits
of
industry
would
be
gradually
formed
and
enterprise
would
be
stimulated
by
their
successful
efforts
to
acquire
a
little
property
and
if
they
afterward
worked
better
as
free
laborers
than
they
now
do
as
slaves
it
would
surely
benefit
their
masters
as
well
as
themselves
that
republican
la
fayette
when
he
returned
to
france
in
felt
strongly
urged
by
a
sense
of
duty
to
effect
the
emancipation
of
slaves
in
the
colony
of
cayenne
as
most
of
the
property
in
the
colony
belonged
to
the
crown
he
was
enabled
to
prosecute
his
plans
with
less
difficulty
than
he
could
otherwise
have
done
thirty
thousand
dollars
were
expended
in
the
purchase
of
plantations
and
slaves
for
the
sole
purpose
of
proving
by
experiment
the
safety
and
good
policy
of
conferring
freedom
being
afraid
to
trust
the
agents
generally
employed
in
the
colony
he
engaged
a
prudent
and
amiable
man
at
paris
to
undertake
the
business
this
gentleman
being
fully
instructed
in
la
fayette
plans
and
wishes
sailed
for
cayenne
the
first
thing
he
did
when
he
arrived
was
to
collect
all
the
and
other
instruments
of
punishment
and
have
them
burnt
amid
a
general
assemblage
of
the
slaves
he
then
made
known
to
them
the
laws
and
rules
by
which
the
estates
would
be
governed
the
object
of
all
the
regulations
was
to
encourage
industry
by
making
it
the
means
of
freedom
this
new
kind
of
stimulus
had
a
most
favorable
effect
on
the
slaves
and
gave
promise
of
complete
success
but
the
judicious
agent
died
in
consequence
of
the
climate
and
the
french
revolution
threw
every
thing
into
a
state
of
convulsion
at
home
and
abroad
the
new
republic
of
france
bestowed
unconditional
emancipation
upon
the
slaves
in
her
colonies
and
had
she
persevered
in
her
promises
with
good
faith
and
discretion
the
horrors
of
domingo
might
have
been
spared
the
emancipated
negroes
in
cayenne
came
in
a
body
to
the
agents
and
declared
that
if
the
plantations
still
belonged
to
general
la
fayette
they
were
ready
and
willing
to
resume
their
labors
for
the
benefit
of
one
who
had
treated
them
like
men
and
cheered
their
toil
by
making
it
a
certain
means
of
freedom
i
can
not
forbear
paying
a
tribute
of
respect
to
the
venerable
moses
brown
of
providence
rhode
island
now
living
in
virtuous
and
vigorous
old
age
he
was
a
in
early
life
and
unless
i
have
been
misinformed
a
likewise
when
his
attention
became
roused
to
religious
subjects
these
facts
troubled
his
conscience
he
easily
and
promptly
decided
that
a
christian
could
not
consistently
keep
slaves
but
he
did
not
dare
to
trust
his
own
nature
to
determine
the
best
manner
of
doing
justice
to
those
he
had
wronged
he
therefore
appointed
a
committee
before
whom
he
laid
a
statement
of
the
expenses
he
had
incurred
for
the
food
and
clothing
of
his
slaves
and
of
the
number
of
years
during
which
he
had
had
the
exclusive
benefit
of
their
labors
he
conceived
that
he
had
no
right
to
charge
them
for
their
freedom
because
god
had
given
them
an
inalienable
right
to
that
possession
from
the
very
hour
of
their
birth
but
he
wished
the
committee
to
decide
what
wages
he
ought
to
pay
them
for
the
work
they
had
done
he
cordially
accepted
the
decision
of
the
committee
paid
the
negroes
their
dues
and
left
them
to
choose
such
employments
as
they
thought
best
many
of
the
grateful
slaves
preferred
to
remain
with
him
as
hired
laborers
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
add
that
moses
brown
is
a
quaker
it
is
commonly
urged
against
emancipation
that
white
men
can
not
possibly
labor
under
the
sultry
climate
of
our
most
southerly
states
this
is
a
good
reason
for
not
sending
the
slaves
out
of
the
country
but
it
is
no
argument
against
making
them
free
no
doubt
we
do
need
their
labor
but
we
ought
to
pay
for
it
why
should
their
presence
be
any
more
disagreeable
as
hired
laborers
than
as
slaves
in
boston
we
continually
meet
colored
people
in
the
streets
and
employ
them
in
various
ways
without
being
endangered
or
even
incommoded
there
is
no
moral
impossibility
in
a
perfectly
kind
and
just
relation
between
the
two
races
if
white
men
think
otherwise
let
remove
from
climates
which
nature
has
made
too
hot
for
their
constitutions
wealth
or
pleasure
often
induces
men
to
change
their
abode
an
emigration
for
the
sake
of
humanity
would
be
an
agreeable
novelty

the

vociferous
complaints
about

so
subordinate

that
the

is
silently
allowed
and
even
openly
supported
by
those
who
ought
to
blush
for
themselves
as
christians
and
as
republicans
let
men
their
arguments
let
them
confine
themselves
to
one
single
question
what
right
can
a
man
have
to
compel
his
neighbor
to
toil
without
reward
and
leave
the
same
hopeless
inheritance
to
his
children
in

that
may
live
in
luxury
and
indolence
let
the
doctrines
of
return
to
the
father
of
lies

invented
them
and
gave

to
turn

way
for
evil
the
christian
knows
no
appeal
from
the
decisions
of

plainly
uttered

his
conscience
the

of

allowed
in
human
beings
and
upon
this
ground

those
who
advertise
mothers
to
be
sold
separately
from
their

likewise
claim
a
right
to
human
flesh
and
they
too
cut
it
nearest
to
the
the
personal
liberty
of
one
man
can
never
be
the

of
another
all
ideas
of
property
are
founded
upon
the
mutual
agreement
of
the
human
race
and
are
regulated
by
such
laws
as
are
deemed
most
conducive
to
the
general
good
in
slavery
there
is
no
agreement
for
in
that
case
it
would
not
be
slavery
the
negro
has
no
voice
in
the
matter
no
alternative
is
presented
to
him
no
bargain
is
made
the
beginning
of
his
bondage
is
the
triumph
of
power
over
weakness
its
continuation
is
the
tyranny
of
knowledge
over
ignorance
one
man
may
as
well
claim
an
exclusive
right
to
the
air
another
man
breathes
as
to
the
possession
of
his
limbs
and
faculties
personal
freedom
is
the
birthright
of
every
human
being
god
himself
made
it
the
first
great
law
of
creation
and
no
human
enactment
can
render
it
null
and
void
if
says
price
you
have
a
right
to
make
another
man
a
slave
he
has
a
right
to
make
you
a

and

says
if
we
have
in
the
beginning
no
right
to
sell
a
man
no
person
has
a
right
to
buy
him
am
i
reminded
that
the
acknowledge
these
vested
rights
in
human
flesh
i
answer
the
laws
themselves
were
made
by
individuals
who
wished
to
justify
the
wrong
and
profit
by
it
we
ought
never
to
have
recognised
a
claim
which
can
not
exist
according
to
the
laws
of
god
it
is
our
duty
to
atone
for
the
error
and
the
sooner
we
make
a
beginning
the
better
will
it
be
for
us
all
must
our
arguments
be
based
upon
justice
and
mercy
to
the
slaveholders
have
the
negroes
no
right
to
ask
compensation
for
their
years
and
years
of
unrewarded
toil
it
is
true
that
they
have
food
and
clothing
of
such
kind
and
in
such
quantities
as
their
masters
think
proper
but
it
is
evident
that
this
is
not
the
worth
of
their
labor
for
the
proprietors
can
give
from
one
hundred
to
five
and
six
hundred
dollars
for
a
slave
beside
the
expense
of
supporting
those
who
are
too
old
or
too
young
to
labor
they
could
not
to
do
this
if
the
slave
did
not
earn
more
than
he
receives
in
food
and
clothing
if
the
laws
allowed
the
slave
to
redeem
himself
progressively
the
owner
would
receive
his
money
back
again
and
the
negro
years
of
uncompensated
toil
would
be
more
than
lawful
interest
the
southerners
are
much
in
the
habit
of
saying
they
really
wish
for
emancipation
if
it
could
be
effected
in
safety
but
i
search
in
vain
for
any
proof
that
these
assertions
are
sincere
when
i
say
this
i
speak
collectively
there
are
no
doubt
individual
exceptions
instead
of
profiting
by
the
experience
of
other
nations
the
as
a
body
have
resolutely
shut
their
eyes
against
the
light
because
they
preferred
darkness
every
change
in
the
laws
has
riveted
the
chain
closer
and
closer
upon
their
victims
every
attempt
to
make
the
voice
of
reason
and
benevolence
heard
has
been
overpowered
with
threatening
and
abuse
a
cautious
vigilance
against
improvement
a
jealousy
of
all
freedom
of
opinion
has
characterized
their
movements
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
wish
to
perpetuate
slavery
they
support
it
with
loud
bravado
or
insidious
sophistry
or
pretended
regret
but
they
never
abandon
the
point
their
great
desire
is
to
keep
the
public
mind
turned
in
another
direction
they
are
well
aware
that
the
ugly
edifice
is
built
of
rotten
timbers
and
stands
on
slippery
sands
if
the
loud
voice
of
public
opinion
could
be
made
to
reverberate
through
its
dreary
chambers
the
unsightly
frame
would
fall
never
to
rise
again
since
so
many
of
their
own
citizens
admit
that
the
policy
of
this
system
is
unsound
and
its
effects
injurious
it
is
wonderful
that
they
do
not
begin
to
destroy
the
costly
iniquity
in
good
earnest
but
habit
is
very
powerful
and
in
the
habit
of
slavery
are
concentrated
the
strongest
evils
of
human
nature
vanity
pride
love
of
power
licentiousness
and
indolence
there
is
a
minority
particularly
in
virginia
and
kentucky
who
sincerely
wish
a
change
for
the
better
but
they
are
overpowered
and
have
not
even
ventured
to
speak
except
in
the
great
virginia
debate
of
in
the
course
of
that
debate
the
spirit
of
slavery
showed
itself
without
disguise
the
members
of
emancipation
but
with
one
or
two
exceptions
they
merely
wanted
to
emancipate
or
rather
to
send
away
the
population
which
they
could
neither
keep
nor
sell
and
which
might
prove
dangerous
they
wished
to
get
rid
of
the
consequences
of
the
evil
but
were
determined
to
keep
the
evil
itself
some
members
from
western
virginia
who
spoke
in
a
better
spirit
and
founded
their
arguments
on
the
broad
principles
of
justice
not
on
the
mere
convenience
of
a
certain
class
were
repelled
with
angry
excitement
the
eastern
districts
threatened
to
separate
from
the
western
if
the
latter
persisted
in
expressing
opinions
opposed
to
the
continuance
of
slavery
from
what
i
have
uniformly
heard
of
the
comparative
prosperity
of
eastern
and
western
virginia
i
should
think
this
was
very
much
like
the
town
poor
threatening
to
separate
from
the
town
the
mere
circumstance
of
daring
to
debate
on
the
subject
was
loudly
reprimanded
and
there
was
a
good
deal
of
indignation
expressed
that
reckless
editors
and
imprudent
correspondents
had
presumed
so
far
as
to
allude
to
it
in
the
columns
of
a
newspaper
discussion
in
the
legislature
was
strongly
deprecated
until
a
plan
had
been
formed
yet
they
must
have
known
that
no
plan
could
be
formed
in
a
republican
government
without
previous
discussion
the
proposal
contained
within
itself
that
power
for
which
the
schemes
of
are
so
remarkable
gholson
sarcastically
rebuked
the
restless
spirit
of
improvement
by
saying
he
really
had
been
under
the
that
he
his
slaves
he
had
lately
purchased
four
women
and
ten
children
in
whom
he
thought
he
had
obtained
a
great
bargain
for
he
supposed
they
were
his
own
property
were
his
brood
to
which
roane
replied
i
own
a
considerable
number
of
slaves
and
am
perfectly
sure
they
are
mine
and
i
am
sorry
to
add
that
i
have
occasionally
though
not
often
been
compelled
to
make
feel
the
of
that
ownership
i
would
not
touch
a
hair
on
the
head
of
the
gentleman
slave
any
sooner
than
i
would
a
hair
in
the
of
his
roane
likewise
remarked
i
think
slavery
as
much
a
correlative
of
liberty
as
cold
is
of
heat
history
experience
observation
and
reason
have
taught
me
that
the
torch
of
liberty
has
ever
burned
brighter
when
surrounded
by
the
dark
and
filthy
yet
atmosphere
of
slavery
i
do
not
believe
in
the
fanfaronade
that
all
men
are
by
nature
equal
but
these
abstract
speculations
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
which
i
am
willing
to
view
as
one
of
cold
sheer
state
policy
in
which
the
safety
prosperity
and
happiness
of
the
are
concerned
would
roane
carry
out
his
logic
into
all
its
details
would
he
cherish
intemperance
that
sobriety
might
shine
the
brighter
would
he
encourage
theft
in
order
to
throw
additional
lustre
upon
honesty
yet
there
seems
to
be
precisely
the
same
relation
between
these
things
that
there
is
between
slavery
and
freedom
such
sentiments
sound
oddly
enough
in
the
mouth
of
a
republican
of
the
nineteenth
century
when
wirt
before
the
supreme
federal
court
said
that
slavery
was
contrary
to
the
laws
of
nature
and
of
nations
and
that
the
law
of
south
carolina
concerning
seizing
colored
seamen
was
unconstitutional
the
governor
directed
several
reproofs
at
him
in
king
laid
on
the
table
of
the
united
states
senate
a
resolution
to
appropriate
the
proceeds
of
the
public
lands
to
the
emancipation
of
slaves
and
the
removal
of
free
negroes
provided
the
same
could
be
done
under
and
agreeable
to
the
laws
of
the
respective
states
he
said
he
did
not
wish
it
to
be
debated
but
considered
at
some
future
time
yet
kindly
and
cautiously
as
this
movement
was
made
the
whole
south
resented
it
and
governor
troup
called
to
the
legislature
and
people
of
georgia
to
stand
to
their
arms
in
the
people
of
baltimore
presented
a
memorial
to
congress
praying
that
slaves
born
in
the
district
of
columbia
after
a
given
time
specified
by
law
might
become
free
on
arriving
at
a
certain
age
a
famous
member
from
south
carolina
called
this
an
impertinent
interference
and
a
violation
of
the
principles
of
and
the
petition
was
not
even
another
southern
gentleman
in
congress
objected
to
the
panama
mission
because
bolivar
had
proclaimed
liberty
to
the
slaves
hayne
in
his
reply
to
webster
says
there
is
a
spirit
which
like
the
father
of
evil
is
constantly
walking
to
and
fro
about
the
earth
seeking
whom
it
may
devour
it
is
the
spirit
of
when
this
is
infused
into
the
bosom
of
a
statesman
if
one
so
possessed
can
be
called
a
statesman
it
converts
him
at
once
into
a
visionary
enthusiast
then
he
indulges
in
golden
dreams
of
national
greatness
and
prosperity
he
discovers
that
is
power
and
not
content
with
vast
schemes
of
improvement
at
home
which
it
would
bankrupt
the
treasury
of
the
world
to
execute
he
flies
to
foreign
lands
to
fulfil
to
the
human
race
by
inculcating
the
principles
of
civil
and
religious
liberty
this
spirit
had
long
been
busy
with
the
slaves
of
the
south
and
it
is
even
now
displaying
itself
in
vain
efforts
to
drive
the
government
from
its
policy
in
relation
to
the
indians
governor
miller
of
south
carolina
speaking
of
the
tariff
and
the
remedy
asserted
that

labor
was
preferable

the
free
states
to
competition
on
fair
terms
governor
hamilton
of
the
same
state
in
delivering
an
address
on
the
same
subject
uttered
a
eulogy
upon
slavery
concluding
as
usual
that
nothing
but
the
tariff
nothing
but
the
rapacity
of
northerners
could
have
nullified
such
great
blessings
of
providence
as
the
cheap
labor
and
fertile
soil
of
carolina
calhoun
in
his
late
speech
in
the
senate
alludes
in
a
tone
of
strong
disapprobation
and
almost
of
reprimand
to
the
remarkable
debate
in
the
virginia
legislature
the
occurrence
of
which
offence
he
charges
to
the
opinions
and
policy
of
the
north
if
these
things
evince
any
real
desire
to
do
away
the
evil
i
can
not
discover
it
there
are
many
who
inherit
the
misfortune
of
slavery
and
would
gladly
renounce
the
miserable
birthright
if
they
could
for
their
sakes
i
wish
the
majority
were
guided
by
a
better
spirit
and
a
wiser
policy
but
this
state
of
things
can
not
last
the
operations
of
divine
providence
are
hastening
the
crisis
and
move
which
way
we
will
it
must
come
in
some
form
or
other
if
we
take
warning
in
time
it
may
come
as
a
blessing
the
spirit
of
philanthropy
which
hayne
calls
walking
to
and
fro
in
the
earth
and
it
will
not
pause
or
turn
back
till
it
has
fastened
the
golden
band
of
love
and
peace
around
a
sinful
world
the
sun
of
knowledge
and
liberty
is
already
high
in
the
heavens
it
is
peeping
into
every
dark
nook
and
corner
of
the
earth
and
the
african
can
not
be
always
excluded
from
its
beams
the
advocates
of
slavery
remind
me
of
a
comparison
i
once
heard
differently
applied
even
thus
does
a
dog
unwilling
to
follow
his
master
carriage
bite
the
wheels
in
a
vain
effort
to
stop
its
progress
chapter
iv
influence
of
slavery
on
the
politics
of
the
united
states
i
believe
these
are
portentous
things
unto
the
climate
that
they
point
upon
indeed
it
is
a
strange
disposed
time
but
men
may
construe
things
after
their
fashion
clean
from
the
purpose
of
the
things
themselves
julius
cæsar
when
slave
representation
was
admitted
into
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
a
wedge
was
introduced
which
has
ever
since
effectually
sundered
the
sympathies
and
interests
of
different
portions
of
the
country
by
this
step
the
slave
states
acquired
an
undue
advantage
which
they
have
maintained
with
anxious
jealousy
and
in
which
the
free
states
have
never
perfectly
acquiesced
the
latter
would
probably
never
have
made
the
concession
so
contrary
to
their
principles
and
the
express
provisions
of
their
state
constitutions
if
powerful
motives
had
not
been
offered
by
the
south
these
consisted
first
in
taking
upon
themselves
a
proportion
of
increased
in
the
same
ratio
as
their
representation
was
increased
by
the
concession
to
their
slaves
in
conceding
to
the
small
states
an
entire
equality
in
the
senate
this
was
not
indeed
proposed
as
an
item
of
the
adjustment
but
it
operated
as
such
for
the
small
states
with
the
exception
of
georgia
which
in
fact
expected
to
become
one
of
the
largest
lay
in
the
north
and
were
either
free
or
likely
soon
to
become
so
during
most
of
the
contest
massachusetts
then
one
of
the
large
states
voted
with
virginia
and
pennsylvania
for
unequal
representation
in
the
senate
but
on
the
final
question
she
was
divided
and
gave
no
vote
there
was
probably
an
increasing
tendency
to
view
this
part
of
the
compromise
not
merely
as
a
concession
of
the
large
to
the
small
states
but
also
of
the
largely
slaveholding
to
the
free
or
slightly
slaveholding
states
the
two
questions
of
slave
representation
with
a
proportional
increase
of
direct
taxes
and
of
perfect
equality
in
the
senate
were
always
connected
together
and
a
large
committee
of
compromise
consisting
of
one
member
from
each
state
expressly
recommended
that
both
provisions
should
be
adopted
but
neither
of
them
without
the
other
such
were
the
equivalents
directly
or
indirectly
offered
by
which
the
free
states
were
induced
to
consent
to
slave
representation
it
was
not
without
very
considerable
struggles
that
they
overcame
their
repugnance
to
admitting
such
a
principle
in
the
construction
of
a
republican
government
gerry
of
massachusetts
exclaimed
against
it
with
evident
horror
but
he
was
chairman
of
the
committee
of
compromise
even
the
slave
states
themselves
seem
to
have
been
a
little
embarrassed
with
the
discordant
element
a
curious
proof
of
this
is
given
in
the
language
of
the
constitution
the
ugly
feature
is
covered
as
cautiously
as
the
deformed
visage
of
the
veiled
prophet
the
words
are
as
follows
representatives
and
direct
taxes
shall
be
apportioned
among
the
states
according
to
their
respective
numbers
which
shall
be
ascertained
by
adding
to
the
whole
number
of
free
persons
those
bound
to
servitude
for
a
term
of
years
and
excluding
indians
not
taxed
three
fifths
of
all
other
in
this
most
elaborate
sentence
a
foreigner
would
discern
no
slavery
none
but
those
already
acquainted
with
the
serpent
would
be
able
to
discover
its
sting
governor
wright
of
maryland
a
contemporary
of
all
these
transactions
and
a
slaveholder

delivering

eulogy
upon
the
kindness
of
masters

expressed
himself
as

us
the
services
of
these
persons
it
does
not
say
for
the
feelings
of
the
framers
of
that
glorious
instrument
would
not
suffer
them
to
use
word
on
account
of
its
its
incongeniality
to
the
idea
of
a
constitution
for
freemen
it
says
held
to
service
or

in
congress
march
footnote
aa
it
was
stated
at
the
time
that
this
person
frequently
steamed
his
negroes
in
order
to
reduce
their
size
to
an
equal
weight
for
riding
this
practice
is
understood
to
be
common
at
the
south
this
high
praise
bestowed
on
the
of
our
constitution
reminds
me
of
an
anecdote
a
clergyman
in
a
neighboring
state
being
obliged
to
be
absent
from
his
parish
procured
a
young
man
to
supply
his
place
who
was
very
worldly
in
his
inclinations
and
very
gay
in
his
manners
when
the
minister
returned
his
people
said
somewhat
reproachfully
how
could
you
provide
such
a
man
to
preach
for
us
might
at
least
have
left
us
a
while
all
parties
agreed
to
act
in
opposition
to
the
of
justice
they
all
concurred
to
pay
homage
to
them
by
hypocrisy
of
men
are
willing
to
try
all
means
to
honest
except
the
simple
experiment
of
so
it
is
true
there
were
individuals
who
distrusted
this
compromise
at
the
time
if
they
did
not
wholly
disapprove
of
it
it
is
said
that
washington
as
he
was
walking
thoughtfully
near
the
schuylkill
was
met
by
a
member
of
the
convention
to
whom
in
the
course
of
conversation
he
acknowledged
that
he
was
meditating
whether
it
would
not
be
better
to
separate
without
proposing
a
constitution
to
the
people
for
he
was
in
great
doubt
whether
the
frame
of
government
which
was
now
nearly
completed
would
be
better
for
them
than
to
trust
to
the
course
of
events
and
await
future
emergencies
this
anecdote
was
derived
from
an
authentic
source
and
i
have
no
doubt
of
its
truth
neither
is
there
any
doubt
that
washington
had
in
his
mind
this
great
compromise
the
pivot
on
which
the
system
of
government
was
to
turn
if
avarice
was
induced
to
shake
hands
with
injustice
from
the
expectation
of
increased
direct
taxation
upon
the
south
she
gained
little
by
the
bargain
with
the
exception
of
two
brief
periods
during
the
french
war
and
the
last
war
with
england
the
revenue
of
the
united
states
has
been
raised
by
on
the
heavy
debts
and
expenditures
of
the
several
states
which
they
had
been
accustomed
to
provide
for
by
direct
taxes
and
which
they
probably
expected
to
see
provided
for
by
the
same
means
in
time
to
come
have
been
all
paid
by
duties
on
imports
the
greatest
proportion
of
these
duties
are
of
course
paid
by
the
free
states
for
here
the
poorest
laborer
daily
consumes
several
articles
of
foreign
production
of
which
from
to
the
price
is
a
tax
paid
to
government
the
clothing
of
the
slave
population
increases
the
revenue
very
little
and
their
food
almost
none
at
all
wherever
free
labor
and
slave
labor
exist
under
the
same
government
there
must
be
a
perpetual
clashing
of
interests
the
legislation
required
for
one
is
in
its
spirit
and
maxims
diametrically
opposed
to
that
required
for
the
other
hence
madison
predicted
in
the
convention
which
formed
our
federal
constitution
that
the
contests
would
be
between
the
great
geographical
sections
that
such
had
been
the
division
even
during
the
war
and
the
confederacy
in
the
same
convention
charles
pinckney
a
man
of
great
sagacity
spoke
of
the
equal
representation
of
large
and
small
states
as
a
matter
of
slight
consequence
no
difficulties
he
said
would
ever
arise
on
that
point
the
question
would
always
be
between
the
slaveholding
and
interests
if
the
pressure
of
common
danger
and
the
sense
of
individual
weakness
during
our
contest
for
independence
could
not
bring
the
states
to
mutual
confidence
nothing
ever
can
do
it
except
a
change
of
character
from
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
to
the
present
time
the
breach
has
been
gradually
widening
the
south
has
pursued
a
uniform
and
sagacious
system
of
policy
which
in
all
its
bearings
direct
and
indirect
has
been
framed
for
the
preservation
and
extension
of
slave
power
this
system
has
in
the
very
nature
of
the
two
things
constantly
interfered
with
the
interests
of
the
free
states
and
hitherto
the
south
have
always
gained
the
victory
this
has
principally
been
accomplished
by
yoking
all
important
questions
together
and
strenuously
resisting
the
passage
of
one
unless
accompanied
by
the
other
the
south
was
desirous
of
removing
the
seat
of
government
from
philadelphia
to
washington
because
the
latter
is
in
a
slave
territory
where
republican
representatives
and
magistrates
can
bring
their
slaves
without
danger
of
losing
them
or
having
them
contaminated
by
the
principles
of
universal
liberty
the
assumption
of
the
state
debts
likely
to
bring
considerable
money
back
to
the
north
was
with
this
question
and
both
were
carried
the
admission
of
maine
into
the
union
as
a
free
state
and
of
missouri
as
a
slave
state
were
two
more
of
these
siamese
twins
not
allowed
to
be
separated
from
each
other
a
numerous
smaller
progeny
may
be
found
in
the
laying
of
imposts
and
the
successive
adjustment
of
protection
to
navigation
the
fisheries
agriculture
and
manufactures
there
would
perhaps
be
no
harm
in
this
system
of
compromises
or
any
objection
to
its
continuing
in
infinite
series
if
no
injustice
were
done
to
a
third
party
which
is
never
heard
or
noticed
except
for
purposes
of
oppression
i
reverence
the
wisdom
of
our
early
legislators
but
they
certainly
did
very
wrong
to
admit
slavery
as
an
element
into
a
free
constitution
and
to
sacrifice
the
known
and
rights
of
a
third
and
weaker
party
in
order
to
cement
a
union
between
two
stronger
ones
such
an
arrangement
ought
not
and
could
not
come
to
good
it
has
given
the
slave
states
a
controlling
power
which
they
will
always
keep
so
long
as
we
remain
together
president
john
adams
was
of
opinion
that
this
ascendency
might
be
attributed
to
an
early
mistake
originating
in
what
he
called
the
frankford
advice
when
the
first
congress
was
summoned
in
philadelphia
doctor
rush
and
two
or
three
other
eminent
men
of
pennsylvania
met
the
massachusetts
delegates
at
frankford
a
few
miles
from
philadelphia
and
conjured
them
as
they
valued
the
success
of
the
common
cause
to
let
no
measure
of
importance
to
originate
with
the
north
to
yield
precedence
in
all
things
to
virginia
and
lead
her
if
possible
to
commit
herself
to
the
revolution
above
all
they
begged
that
not
a
word
might
be
said
about
independence
for
that
a
strong
prejudice
already
existed
against
the
delegates
from
on
account
of
a
supposed
design
to
throw
off
their
allegiance
to
the
mother
country
the
frankford
advice
was
followed
the
delegates
from
virginia
took
the
lead
on
all
occasions
his
son

that

had
twenty

not
elected

by
those
who
owned
it
and
if
he
should
go
back
to
the
history
of
this

from
its
foundation
it
would
be
easy
to
prove
that
its
decisions
had
been
affected
in
general
by
less
majorities
than
that
nay
he
might
go
farther

insist
that
that

representation
had
ever
been
in

ruling
power
of
this
footnote
ab
there
are
now
representatives
that
is
representatives
of

the
history
of
the
union
has
afforded
a
continual
proof
that
this
representation
of
property
which
they
enjoy
as
well
in
the
election
of
president
and
of
the
united
states
as
upon
the
floor
of
the
house
of
representatives
has
secured
to
the
slaveholding
states
the
entire
control
of
the
national
policy
and
almost
without
exception
the
possession
of
the
highest
executive
office
of
the
union
always
united
in
the
purpose
of
regulating
the
affairs
of
the
whole
union
by
the
standard
of
the
slaveholding
interest
their
disproportionate
numbers
in
the
electoral
colleges
have
enabled
them
in
ten
out
of
twelve
quadrennial
elections
to
confer
the
chief
magistracy
upon
one
of
their
own
citizens
their
suffrages
at
every
election
without
exception
have
been
almost
exclusively
confined
to
a
candidate
of
their
own
caste
availing
themselves
of
the
divisions
which
from
the
nature
of
man
always
prevail
in
communities
entirely
free
they
have
sought
and
found
auxiliaries
in
the
other
quarters
of
the
union
by
associating
the
passions
of
parties
and
the
ambition
of
individuals
with
their
own
purposes
to
establish
and
maintain
throughout
the
confederated
nation
the
slaveholding
policy
the
office
of
a
station
of
high
dignity
but
of
little
other
than
contingent
power
had
been
usually
by
their
indulgence
conceded
to
a
citizen
of
the
other
section
but
even
this
political
courtesy
was
superseded
at
the
election
before
the
last
and
both
the
offices
of
president
and
of
the
united
states
were
by
the
preponderancy
of
slaveholding
votes
bestowed
upon
citizens
of
two
adjoining
and
both
slaveholding
states
at
this
moment
the
president
of
the
united
states
the
president
of
the
senate
the
speaker
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
chief
justice
of
the
united
states
are
all
citizens
of
that
favored
portion
of
the
united
republic
the
last
of
these
offices
being
under
the
constitution
held
by
the
tenure
of
good
behaviour
has
been
honored
and
dignified
by
the
occupation
of
the
present
incumbent
upwards
of
thirty
years
an
overruling
sense
of
the
high
responsibilities
under
which
it
is
held
has
effectually
guarded
him
from
permitting
the
sectional
slaveholding
spirit
to
ascend
the
tribunal
of
justice
and
it
is
not
difficult
to
discern
in
this
inflexible
impartiality
the
source
of
the
obloquy
which
that
same
spirit
has
not
been
inactive
in
attempting
to
excite
against
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
itself
and
of
the
insuperable
aversion
of
the
votaries
of
nullification
to
encounter
or
abide
by
the
decision
of
that
tribunal
the
true
and
legitimate
umpire
of
constitutional
controverted
law
it
is
worthy
of
observation
that
this
slave
representation
is
always
used
to
protect
and
extend
slave
power
and
in
this
way
the
slaves
themselves
are
made
to
vote
for
slavery
they
are
compelled
to
furnish
halters
to
hang
their
posterity
machiavel
says
that
the
whole
politics
of
rival
states
consist
in
checking
the
growth
of
one
another
it
is
sufficiently
obvious
that
the
slave
and
free
states
are
and
must
be
rivals
owing
to
the
inevitable
contradiction
of
their
interests
it
needed
no
machiavel
to
predict
the
result
a
continual
strife
has
been
going
on
more
or
less
earnest
according
to
the
nature
of
the
interests
it
involved
and
the
south
has
always
had
strength
and
skill
to
carry
her
point
of
all
our
presidents
washington
alone
had
power
to
keep
the
jealousies
of
his
countrymen
in
check
and
he
used
his
influence
nobly
some
of
his
successors
have
cherished
those
jealousies
and
made
effective
use
of
them
the
people
of
the
north
have
to
manage
a
rocky
and
reluctant
soil
hence
commerce
and
the
fisheries
early
attracted
their
attention
the
products
of
these
employments
were
as
they
should
be
proportioned
to
the
dexterity
and
hard
labor
required
in
their
pursuit
the
north
grew
opulent
and
her
politicians
who
came
in
contact
with
those
of
the
south
with
any
thing
like
rival
pretensions
represented
the
commercial
class
which
was
the
nucleus
of
the
old
federal
party
the
southerners
have
a
genial
climate
and
a
fertile
soil
but
in
consequence
of
the
cumbrous
machinery
of
slave
labor
which
is
slow
for
every
thing
except
exhausting
the
soil
they
have
always
been
less
prosperous
than
the
free
states
it
is
said
i
know
not
with
how
much
truth
but
it
is
certainly
very
credible
that
a
great
proportion
of
their
plantations
are
deeply
mortgaged
in
and
philadelphia
it
is
likewise
said
that
the
expenses
of
the
planters
are
generally
one
or
two
years
in
advance
of
their
income
whether
these
statements
be
true
or
not
the
most
casual
observer
will
decide
that
the
free
states
are
uniformly
the
most
prosperous
notwithstanding
the
south
possesses
a
political
power
by
which
she
manages
to
us
at
every
important
move
when
we
add
this
to
the
original
jealousy
spoken
of
by
madison
it
is
not
wonderful
that
southern
politicians
take
so
little
pains
to
conceal
their
strong
dislike
of
the
north
a
striking
difference
of
manners
also
caused
by
slavery
serves
to
aggravate
other
differences
slaveholders
have
the
habit
of
command
and
from
the
superior
ease
with
which
it
sits
upon
them
they
seem
to
imagine
that
they
were
born
to
command
and
we
to
obey
in
time
of
war
they
tauntingly
told
us
that
we
might
furnish
the
and
they
would
furnish
the
but
in
time
of
peace
they
find
our
list
of
pensioners
so
large
they
complain
that
we
did
furnish
so
many
men
at
the
north
every
body
is
busy
in
some
employment
and
politics
with
very
few
exceptions
form
but
a
brief
episode
in
the
lives
of
the
citizens
but
the
southern
politicians
are
men
of
leisure
they
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
ride
round
their
plantations
hunt
attend
the
races
study
politics
for
the
next
legislative
or
congressional
campaign
and
decide
how
to
use
the
prodigious
mechanical
power
of
slave
representation
which
a
political
archimedes
may
effectually
wield
for
the
destruction
of
commerce
or
any
thing
else
involving
the
prosperity

footnote
ac
the
hon
seabrook
a
southern
gentleman
has
lately
written
a
pamphlet
on
the
management
of
slaves
in
which
he
says
an
addition
of
one
million
dollars
to
the
private
fortune
of
daniel
webster
would
not
give
to
massachusetts
more
than
she
now
possesses
in
the
federal
councils
on
the
other
hand
every
increase
of
slave
property
in
south
carolina
is
a
fraction
thrown
into
the
scale
by
which
her
representation
in
is
determined
it
has
been
already
said
that
most
of
the
wealth
in
was
made
by
commerce
consequently
the
south
became
unfriendly
to
commerce
there
was
a
class
in
jealous
and
not
without
reason
of
their
own
commercial
aristocracy
it
was
the
policy
of
the
south
to
foment
their
passions
and
increase
their
prejudices
thus
was
the
old
democratic
party
formed
and
while
that
party
honestly
supposed
they
were
merely
resisting
the
encroachments
of
a
nobility
at
home
they
were
actually
playing
a
game
for
one
of
the
most
aristocratic
classes
in
the
world
viz
the
southern
planters
a
famous
and
politician
openly
boasted
that
the
south
could
always
put
down
the
aristocracy
of
the
north
by
means
of
her
own
democracy
in
this
point
of
view
democracy
becomes
a
machine
used
by
one
aristocratic
class
against
another
that
has
less
power
and
is
therefore
less
dangerous
there
are
features
in
the
organization
of
society
resulting
from
slavery
which
are
conducive
to
any
thing
but
the
union
of
these
states
a
large
class
are
without
employment
are
accustomed
to
command
and
have
a
strong
contempt
for
habits
of
industry
this
class
like
the
nobility
of
feudal
times
are
restless
impetuous
eager
for
excitement
and
prompt
to
settle
all
questions
with
the
sword
like
the
fierce
old
barons
at
the
head
of
their
vassals
they
are
ever
ready
to
resist
and
nullify
the
power
of
the
state
whenever
it
interferes
with
their
individual
interests
or
even
approaches
the
strong
holds
of
their
prejudices
all
history
shows
that
men
possessing
hereditary
despotic
power
can
not
easily
be
brought
to
acknowledge
a
superior
either
in
the
administrators
of
the
laws
or
in
the
law
itself
it
was
precisely
such
a
class
of
men
that
covered
europe
with
camps
for
upwards
of
ten
centuries
a
southern
governor
has
dignified
duelling
with
the
name
of
an
institution

the
planters
generally
seem
to
regard
it
as
among
those
which
they
have
denominated
their
peculiar
institutions
general
wilkinson

in

great
abhorrence

young
lawyer

went
from

frequently
declared
that
he

not
take
any
stand
there
as
a
lawyer
or
a
gentleman
until
he
had
fought
he
was
subject
to
continual
insult
and
degradation
until
he
had
evinced
his
readiness
to
kill
or
be
killed
it
is
obvious
that
such
a
state
of
morals
elevates
mere
physical
courage
into
a
most
undue
importance
there
are
indeed
emergencies
when
all
the
virtues

all
the
best
affections
of
man

intertwined
with
personal
bravery

this
is
not
the
kind
of
courage
which
makes
duelling

fashion

patriot
nobly
sacrifices
himself

the
good

overawe
the
representatives
from

any
question
even
remotely
connected
with
slavery
is
about
to
be
discussed
and
this
united
with
our
strong
reverence
for
the
union
has
made
our
legislators
shamefully
cautious
with
regard
to
a
subject
which
peculiarly
demands
moral
courage
and
an
abandonment
of
selfish
considerations
if
a
member
of
congress
does
stand
his
ground
firmly
if
he
wants
no
preferment
or
profit
which
the
southern
influence
can
give
an
effort

then
made
to
intimidate
him

it
was
ever
the
policy
of
the
slave
states
to
destroy
the
navy
vast
conquests
by
were
contemplated
for
the
protection
of
northern
commerce
whatever
was
intended
the
work
of
destruction
was
done
the
policy
of
the
south
stood
for
awhile
like
a
giant
among
ruins
received
a
blow
which
crushed
her
energies
but
could
not
annihilate
them
where
the
system
of
free
labor
prevails
and
there
is
work
of
any
kind
to
be
done
there
is
a
provided
for
pressure
in
such
a
community
there
is
a
vital
and
active
principle
which
can
not
be
long
repressed
you
may
dam
up
the
busy
waters
but
they
will
sweep
away
obstructions
or
force
a
new
channel
immediately
after
the
peace
when
commerce
again
began
to
try
her
broken
wings
the
south
took
care
to
keep
her
down
by
multiplying
permanent
embarrasments
in
the
shape
of
duties
the
tax
which
would
have
borne
equally
upon
them
and
which
in
the
original
compact
was
the
equivalent
for
slave
representation
was
forthwith
repealed
and
commerce
was
burdened
with
the
payment
of
the
national
debt
the
encouragement
of
the
consumption
of
domestic
products
or
within
was
then
urged
upon
us
this
was
an
ancient
doctrine
of
the
democratic
party
jefferson
was
its
strongest
advocate
did
he
think
it
likely
to
bear
unfavorably
upon
the
nation
of
shopkeepers
and
pedlers
ae
the
northerners
adopted
it
with
sincere
views
to
economy
and
more
perfect
independence
the
duties
were
so
adjusted
as
to
embarrass
commerce
and
to
guard
the
interests
of
a
few
in
the
north
who
from
patriotism
party
spirit
or
private
interest
had
established
manufactures
on
a
considerable
scale
this
system
of
protection
opposed
by
the
north
was
begun
in
by
southern
politicians
and
enlarged
and
confirmed
by
them
in
it
was
carried
nearly
as
much
by
southern
influence
as
was
the
war
itself
and
if
the
votes
were
placed
side
by
side
there
could
not
be
a
doubt
of
the
identity
of
the
interests
and
passions
which
lay
concealed
under
both
but
enterprise
that
moral
perpetual
motion
overcomes
all
obstacles
neat
and
flourishing
villages
rose
in
every
valley
of
the
busy
hum
of
machinery
made
music
with
her
neglected
waterfalls
all
her
streams
like
the
famous
pactolus
flowed
with
gold
from
her
discouraged
and
embarrassed
commerce
arose
a
greater
blessing
apparently
indestructible
walls
of
brick
and
granite
could
not
easily
be
overturned
by
the
southern
and
left
to
decay
as
the
had
done
thus
mordecai
was
again
seated
in
the
king
gate
by
means
of
the
very
system
intended
for
his
ruin
as
soon
as
this
state
of
things
became
perceptible
the
south
commenced
active
hostility
with
manufactures
doleful
pictures
of
southern
desolation
and
decay
were
given
and
all
attributed
to
manufactures
the
north
was
said
to
be
plundering
the
south
while
she
poor
dame
was
enriching
her
neighbors
and
growing
poor
upon
her
extensive
labors
if
this
statement
be
true
how
much
gratitude
do
we
owe
the
for
they
do
all
the
work
that
is
done
at
the
south
their
masters
only
serve
to
keep
them
in
a
condition
where
they
do
not
accomplish
half
as
much
as
they
otherwise
would

seems
to
be
like

at
all

the
bitter
discussions
in
congress
have
grown
out
of
this
strong
dislike
to
the
free
states
and
the
crown
of
the
whole
policy
is
nullification
the
single
state
of
south
carolina
has
undertaken
to
abolish
the
revenues
of
the
whole
nation
and
threatened
the
federal
government
with
cecession
from
the
union
in
case
the
laws
were
enforced
by
any
other
means
than
through
the
judicial
tribunals
it
is
not
a
little
extraordinary
that
this
new
pretention
of
south
carolina
the
state
which
above
all
others
enjoys
this
unrequited
privilege
of
excessive
representation
released
from
all
payment
of
the
direct
taxes
of
which
her
proportion
would
be
nearly
double
that
of
any
state
should
proceed
from
that
very
complaint
that
she
bears
an
unequal
proportion
of
duties
of
imposts
which
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
are
required
to
be
uniform
throughout
the
union
vermont
with
a
free
population
of
two
hundred
and
eighty
thousand
souls
has
five
representatives
in
the
popular
house
of
congress
and
seven
electors
for
president
and
south
carolina
with
a
free
population
of
less
than
two
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
souls
sends
nine
members
to
the
house
of
representatives
and
honors
the
governor
of
virginia
with
eleven
votes
for
the
office
of
president
of
the
united
states
if
the
rule
of
representation
were
the
same
for
south
carolina
and
for
vermont
they
would
have
the
same
number
of
representatives
in
the
house
and
the
same
number
of
electors
for
the
choice
of
president
and
she
has
nearly
double
the
number
of
both
what
would
the
south
have
they
took
the
management
at
the
very
threshold
of
our
government
and
excepting
the
rigidly
just
administration
of
washington
they
have
kept
it
ever
since
they
claimed
slave
representation
and
obtained
it
for
their
convenience
the
revenues
were
raised
by
imposts
instead
of
direct
taxes
and
thus
they
give
little
or
nothing
in
exchange
for
their
excessive
representation
they
have
increased
the
slave
states
till
they
have
votes
in
congress
they
have
laid
the
embargo
and
declared
war
they
have
controlled
the
expenditures
of
the
nation
they
have
acquired
louisiana
and
florida
for
an
eternal
slave
market
and
perchance
for
the
manufactory
of
more
slave
states
they
have
given
five
presidents
out
of
seven
to
the
united
states
and
in
their
attack
upon
manufactures
they
have
gained
clay
bill
but
all
this
availeth
not
so
long
as
mordecai
the
jew
sitteth
in
the
king
gate
the
free
states
must
be
kept
down
but
change
their
policy
as
they
will
free
states
be
kept
down
there
is
but
one
way
to
ruin
them
and
that
is
to
make
them
slave
states
if
the
south
with
all
her
power
and
skill
can
not
manage
herself
into
prosperity
it
is
because
the
difficulty
lies
at
her
own
doors
and
she
will
not
remove
it
at
one
time
her
deserted
villages
were
attributed
to
the
undue
patronage
bestowed
upon
settlers
on
the
public
lands
at
another
the
tariff
is
the
cause
of
her
desolation
slavery
the
real
root
of
the
evil
is
carefully
kept
out
of
sight
as
a
delicate
subject
which
must
not
be
alluded
to
it
is
a
singular
fact
in
the
present
age
of
the
world
that
delicate
and
indelicate
subjects
mean
precisely
the
same
thing
if
any
proof
were
wanted
that
is
the
cause
of
all
this
discord
it
is
furnished
by
eastern
and
western
virginia
they
belong
to
the
same
state
and
are
protected
by
the
same
laws
but
in
the
former
the
slaveholding
interest
is
very
strong
while
in
the
latter
it
is
scarcely
any
thing
the
result
is
warfare
and
continual
complaints
and
threats
of
separation
there
are
no
such
contentions
between
the
different
sections
of
states
simply
because
slavery
the
exciting
cause
of
strife
does
not
exist
among
them
the
constant
threat
of
the
slaveholding
states
is
the
dissolution
of
the
union
and
they
have
repeated
it
with
all
the
earnestness
of
sincerity
though
there
are
powerful
reasons
why
it
would
not
be
well
for
them
to
venture
upon
that
untried
state
of
being
in
one
respect
only
are
these
threats
of
any
consequence
they
have
familiarized
the
public
mind
with
the
subject
of
separation
and
diminished
the
reverence
with
which
the
free
states
have
hitherto
regarded
the
union
the
farewell
advice
of
washington
operated
like
a
spell
upon
the
hearts
and
consciences
of
his
countrymen
for
many
many
years
after
his
death
it
would
almost
have
been
deemed
blasphemy
to
speak
of
separation
as
a
possible
event
i
would
that
it
still
continued
so
but
it
is
now
an
occurrence
to
hear
politicians
of
all
parties
conjecturing
what
system
would
be
pursued
by
different
sections
of
the
country
in
case
of
a
dissolution
of
the
union
this
evil
is
likewise
chargeable
upon
slavery
the
threats
of
separation
have
come
from
the
slaveholding
states
and
on
many
important
measures
the
free
states
have
been
awed
into
acquiescence
by
their
respect
for
the
union
adams
in
the
able
and
manly
report
before
alluded
to
says
it
can
not
be
denied
that
in
a
community
spreading
over
a
large
extent
of
territory
and
politically
founded
upon
the
principles
proclaimed
in
the
declaration
of
independence
but
differing
so
widely
in
the
elements
of
their
social
condition
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
territory
are
wholly
free
and
those
of
the
other
half
divided
into
masters
and
slaves
deep
if
not
irreconcilable
collisions
of
interest
must
abound
the
question
whether
such
a
community
can
exist
under
one
common
government
is
a
subject
of
profound
philosophical
speculation
in
theory
whether
it
can
continue
long
to
exist
is
a
question
to
be
solved
only
by
the
experiment
now
making
by
the
people
of
this
union
under
that
national
compact
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
the
admission
of
missouri
into
the
union
is
another
clear
illustration
of
the
slaveholding
power
that
contest
was
marked
by
the
same
violence
and
the
same
threats
as
have
characterized
nullification
on
both
occasions
the
planters
were
pitted
against
the
commercial
and
manufacturing
sections
of
the
country
on
both
occasions
the
democracy
of
the
north
was
by
one
means
or
another
induced
to
throw
its
strength
upon
the
southern
to
increase
its
already
prodigious
power
on
both
and
on
all
occasions
some
little
support
has
been
given
to
northern
principles
in
maryland
virginia
and
north
carolina
because
in
portions
of
those
states
there
is
a
considerable
commercial
interest
and
some
encouragement
of
free
labor
so
true
it
is
in
the
minutest
details
that
slavery
and
freedom
are
always
arrayed
in
opposition
to
each
other
at
the
time
of
the
missouri
question
the
pestiferous
effects
of
slavery
had
become
too
obvious
to
escape
the
observation
of
the
most
superficial
statesman
the
new
free
states
admitted
into
the
union
enjoyed
tenfold
prosperity
compared
with
the
new
slave
states
give
a
free
laborer
a
barren
rock
and
he
will
soon
cover
it
with
vegetation
while
the
slave
and
his
would
change
the
garden
of
eden
to
a
desert
but
missouri
must
be
admitted
as
a
slave
state
for
two
strong
reasons
first
that
the
planters
might
perpetuate
their
predominant
influence
by
adding
to
the
slave
representation
the
power
of
which
is
always
concentrated
against
the
interests
of
the
free
states
second
that
a
new
market
might
be
opened
for
their
surplus
slaves
it
is
lamentable
to
think
that
two
votes
in
favor
of
missouri
slavery
were
given
by
massachusetts
men
and
that
those
two
votes
would
have
turned
the
scale
the
planters
loudly
threatened
to
dissolve
the
union
if
slavery
were
not
extended
beyond
the
mississippi
if
the
union
can
not
be
preserved
without
crime
it
is
an
eternal
truth
that
nothing
good
can
be
preserved
crime
the
immense
territories
of
louisiana
arkansas
and
florida
are
very
likely
to
be
formed
into
slave
states
and
every
new
vote
on
this
side
places
the
free
states
more
and
more
at
the
mercy
of
the
south
and
gives
a
renewed
and
apparently
interminable
lease
to
the
duration
of
slavery
the
purchase
or
the
conquest
of
the
texas
is
a
favorite
scheme
with
southerners
because
it
would
occasion
such
an
inexhaustible
demand
for
slaves
a
gentleman
in
the
virginia
convention
thought
the
acquisition
of
the
texas
so
certain
that
he
made
calculations
upon
the
increased
value
of
negroes
we
have
reason
to
thank
god
that
the
jealousy
of
the
mexican
government
places
a
barrier
in
that
direction
the
existence
of
slavery
among
us
prevents
the
recognition
of
haytian
independence
that
republic
is
fast
increasing
in
wealth
intelligence
and
her
commerce
is
valuable
to
us
and
might
become
much
more
so
but
our
northern
representatives
have
never
even
made
an
effort
to
have
her
independence
acknowledged
because
a
colored
ambassador
would
be
so
disagreeable
to
our
prejudices
few
are
aware
of
the
extent
of
dislike
in
this
country
and
i
would
not
speak
of
it
if
i
thought
it
possible
to
add
to
it
the
late
john
taylor
a
man
of
great
natural
talent
wrote
a
book
on
the
agriculture
of
virginia
in
which
he
acknowledges
impoverishment
but
attributes
it
all
to
the
mismanagement
of
in
this
work
taylor
has
embodied
more
of
the
genuine
spirit
the
ethics
and
politics
of
planters
than
any
other
man
excepting
perhaps
john
randolph
in
his
speeches
he
treats
merchants
capitalists
bankers
and
all
other
people
not
planters
as
so
many
robbers
who
live
by
plundering
the
apparently
forgetting
by
what
plunder
they
themselves
live
jefferson
and
other
eminent
men
from
the
south
have
occasionally
betrayed
the
same
strong
prejudices
but
they
were
more
guarded
lest
the
democracy
of
the
north
should
be
undeceived
and
their
votes
lost
taylor
book
is
in
high
repute
in
the
southern
states
and
its
sentiments
widely
echoed
but
it
is
little
known
here
a
year
or
two
since
i
received
a
letter
from
a
publisher
who
largely
supplies
the
southern
market
in
which
he
assured
me
that
no
book
from
the
north
would
sell
at
the
south
unless
the
source
from
which
it
came
were
carefully
concealed
yet
has
always
yielded
to
southern
policy
in
preference
to
uniting
with
the
middle
states
with
which
she
has
in
most
respects
a
congeniality
of
interests
and
habits
it
has
been
the
constant
policy
of
the
slave
states
to
prevent
the
free
states
from
acting
together
who
does
not
see
that
the
american
people
are
walking
over
a
subterranean
fire
the
flames
of
which
are
fed
by
slavery
the
south
no
doubt
gave
her
influence
to
general
jackson
from
the
conviction
that
a
would
support
the
slaveholding
interest
the
proclamation
against
the
nullifiers
which
has
given
the
president
such
sudden
popularity
at
the
north
has
of
course
offended
them
no
person
has
a
right
to
say
that
proclamation
is
insincere
it
will
be
extraordinary
if
a
does
in
depart
from
the
uniform
system
of
his
brethren
in
the
president
last
message
it
is
maintained
that
the
wealthy
landholders
that
is
the
planters
are
the
part
of
the
population
it
admits
that
the
laws
for
raising
of
revenue
by
imposts
have
been
in
their
operation
oppressive
to
the
south
it
recommends
a
gradual
withdrawing
of
protection
from
manufactures
it
advises
that
the
public
lands
shall
cease
to
be
a
source
of
revenue
as
soon
as
practicable
that
they
be
sold
to
settlers
and
in
a
the
disposal
of
the
soil
be
surrendered
to
states
respectively
in
which
it
lastly
the
message
tends
to
discourage
future
appropriations
of
public
money
for
purposes
of
internal
improvement
every
one
of
these
items
is
a
concession
to
the
slaveholding
policy
if
the
public
lands
are
taken
from
the
nation
and
given
to
the
states
in
which
the
soil
lies
who
will
get
the
largest
share
that
part
of
the
population
called

the
proclamation
and
the
message
are
very
unlike

other

to
these
two
societies
at
present
that
it
will
be
difficult
to
present
a
view
of
them
which
will
be
perfectly
satisfactory
to
all
i
shall
say
what
appears
to
me
to
be
candid
and
true
without
any
anxiety
as
to
whom
it
may
please
and
whom
it
may
displease
i
need
not
say
that
i
have
a
decided
predilection
because
it
has
been
sufficiently
betrayed
in
the
preceding
pages
and
i
allude
to
it
for
the
sake
of
perfect
sincerity
rather
than
from
any
idea
that
my
opinion
is
important
the
american
colonization
society
was
organized
a
little
more
than
sixteen
years
ago
at
the
city
of
washington
chosen
as
the
most
central
place
in
the
union
auxiliary
institutions
have
since
been
formed
in
almost
every
part
of
the
country
and
nearly
all
the
distinguished
men
belong
to
it
the
doing
away
of
slavery
in
the
united
states
by
gradually
removing
all
the
blacks
to
africa
has
been
generally
supposed
to
be
its
object
the
project
at
first
excited
some
jealousy
in
the
southern
states
and
the
society
in
order
to
allay
this
were
anxious
to
make
all
possible
concessions
to
in
their
addresses
reports
in
clay
speech
printed
in
the
first
annual
report
of
the
society
he
said
it
is
far
from
the
intention
of
this
society
to
affect
in
the
tenure
by
which
a
certain
species
of
property
is
held
i
am
myself
a
slaveholder
and
i
consider
that
kind
of
property
as
inviolable
as
any
other
in
the
country
i
would
resist
encroachment
upon
it
as
soon
and
with
as
much
firmness
as
i
would
upon
any
other
property
that
i
hold
nor
am
i
prepared
to
go
as
far
as
the
gentleman
who
has
just
spoken
mercer
in
saying
that
i
would
emancipate
my
slaves
if
the
means
were
provided
of
sending
them
from
the
country
at
the
same
meeting
randolph
said
he
thought
it
necessary
being
himself
a
slaveholder
to
show
that
so
far
from
being
in
the
connected
with
the
abolition
of
slavery
the
proposed
society
prove
one
of
the
greatest
securities
to
enable
the
master
to
keep
in
possession
his
own
in
clay
speech
in
the
second
annual
report
he
declares
it
is
not
proposed
to
deliberate
upon
or
consider
at
all
any
question
of
emancipation
or
any
that
is
with
the
abolition
of
slavery
on
this
condition
alone
gentlemen
from
the
south
and
west
can
be
expected
to
on
this
condition
only
i
have
myself
attended
in
the
seventh
annual
report
it
is
said
an
effort
for
the
benefit
of
the
blacks
in
which
all
parts
of
the
country
can
unite
of
course
must
not
have
the
abolition
of
slavery
for
its
immediate
object
may
it
aim
directly
at
the
instruction
of
the
archer
of
virginia
fifteenth
annual
report
says
the
object
of
the
society
if
i
understand
it
aright
involves
no
intrusion
on
property
even
upon
in
the
speech
of
james
green
esq
he
says
this
society
have
ever
disavowed
and
they
do
yet
disavow
that
their
object
is
the
emancipation
of
slaves
they
have
no
if
they
to
interfere
in
the
smallest
degree
with
what
they
deem
the
most
interesting
and
fearful
subject
which
can
be
pressed
upon
the
american
public
there
is
no
people
that
treat
their
slaves
with
so
much
kindness
and
so
little
cruelty
in
almost
every
address
delivered
before
the
society
similar
expressions
occur
on
the
propriety
of
discussing
the
evils
of
slavery
without
bitterness
and
without
fear
good
men
may
differ
in
opinion
though
i
think
the
time
is
fast
coming
when
they
will
all
agree
but
by
assuming
the
ground
implied
in
the
above
remarks
the
colonization
society
have
fallen
into
the
habit
of
glossing
over
the
enormities
of
the
slave
system
at
least
it
so
appears
to
me
in
their
constitution
they
have
pledged
themselves
not
to
speak
write
or
do
anything
to
offend
the
southerners
and
as
there
is
no
possible
way
of
making
the
truth
pleasant
to
those
who
do
not
love
it
the
society
must
perforce
keep
the
truth
out
of
sight
in
many
of
their
publications
i
have
thought
i
discovered
a
lurking
tendency
to
palliate
slavery
or
at
least
to
make
the
best
of
it
they
often
bring
to
my
mind
the
words
of
hamlet
forgive
me
this
my
virtue
for
in
the
fatness
of
these
pursy
times
virtue
itself
of
vice
must
pardon
beg
yea
curb
and
woo
for
leave
to
do
him
good
thus
in
an
address
delivered
march
we
are
told
it
ought
never
to
be
forgotten
that
the
between
africa
and
america
had
its
origin
in
a
compassionate
endeavor
to
relieve
by
the
substitution
of
negro
labor
the
toils
endured
by
native
indians
it
was
the
form
of
that
piloted
the
first
across
the
atlantic
i
am
aware
that
las
cases
used
this
argument
but
it
was
less
unbecoming
in
him
than
it
is
in
a
philanthropist
of
the
present
day
the
speaker
does
indeed
say
that
the
of
agonies
and
the
infinite
of
crime
since
suffered
and
committed
proves
that
mercy
can
not
exist
in
opposition
to
justice
i
can
hardly
realize
what
sort
of
a
conscience
it
must
be
that
needed
the
demonstration
the
plain
truth
was
the
spaniards
were
in
a
hurry
for
gold
they
overworked
the
native
indians
who
were
inconsiderate
enough
to
die
in
very
inconvenient
numbers
but
the
gold
must
be
had
and
that
quickly
and
so
the
africans
were
forced
to
come
and
die
in
company
with
the
indians
and
in
the
nineteenth
century
we
are
told
it
is
our
duty
not
to
forget
that
this
was
a
simulated
form
of
mercy
a
form
would
have
been
the
better
expression
if
we
may
believe
the
whole
system
from
beginning
to
end
is
a
matter
of
mercy
they
have
described
the
middle
passage
with
its
gags
fetters
and
as
the
happiest
period
of
a
life
they
say
they
do
the
slaves
a
great
charity
in
bringing
them
from
barbarous
africa
to
a
civilized
and
christian
country
and
on
the
plantation
under
the
whip
of
the
driver
the
negroes
are
so
happy
that
a
west
india
planter
publicly
declared
he
could
not
look
upon
them
without
wishing
to
be
himself
a
slave
in
the
speech
above
referred
to
we
are
told
that
as
to
any
political
interference
the
slave
states
are
states
we
can
alienate
their
feelings
until
they
become
foreign
enemies
or
on
the
other
hand
we
can
conciliate
them
until
they
become
allies
and
auxiliaries
in
the
sacred
cause
of
emancipation
but
so
long
as
the
south
insist
that
slavery
is
and
say
they
will
not
tolerate
any
schemes
to
its
abolition
and
so
long
as
the
north
take
the
of
slavery
for
an
unalterable
truth
and
put
down
any
discussions
however
mild
and
candid
which
tend
to
show
that
it
be
done
away
with
safety
so
long
as
we
thus
strengthen
each
other
hands
in
evil
what
remote
hope
is
there
of
emancipation
if
by
political
interference
is
meant
interference
or
even
a
desire
to
promote
insurrection
i
should
at
once
pronounce
it
to
be
most
wicked
but
if
by
political
interference
is
meant
the
liberty
to
investigate
this
subject
as
other
subjects
are
investigated
to
inquire
into
what
has
been
done
and
what
may
be
done
i
say
it
is
our
sacred
duty
to
do
it
to
enlighten
public
opinion
is
the
best
way
that
has
yet
been
discovered
for
the
removal
of
national
evils
and
slavery
is
certainly
a
evil
the
southern
states
according
to
their
own
evidence
are
impoverished
by
it
a
great
amount
of
wretchedness
and
crime
inevitably
follows
in
its
train
the
prosperity
of
the
north
is
continually
checked
by
it
it
promotes
feelings
of
rivalry
between
the
states
it
separates
our
interests
makes
our
councils
discordant
threatens
the
destruction
of
our
government
and
disgraces
us
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
i
have
often
heard
americans
who
have
been
abroad
declare
that
nothing
embarrassed
them
so
much
as
being
questioned
about
our
slaves
and
that
nothing
was
so
mortifying
as
to
have
the
pictures
of
runaway
negroes
pointed
at
in
the
newspapers
of
this
republic
la
fayette
with
all
his
admiration
for
our
institutions
can
never
speak
of
the
subject
without
regret
and
shame
now
a
common
evil
certainly
implies
a
common
right
to
remedy
and
where
is
the
remedy
to
be
found
if
the
south
in
all
their
speeches
and
writings
repeat
that
slavery
exist
if
the
colonization
society
in
all
their
addresses
and
reports
that
there
is
no
help
for
the
evil
and
it
is
very
wicked
to
hint
that
there
is
and
if
public
opinion
here
brands
every
body
as
a
fanatic
and
madman
who
wishes
to
what
can
be
done
the
supineness
of
on
this
subject
reminds
me
of
the
man
who
being
asked
to
work
at
the
pump
because
the
vessel
was
going
down
answered
i
am
only
a
passenger
an
error
often
and
urgently
repeated
is
apt
to
receive
the
sanction
of
truth
and
so
it
is
in
this
case
the
public
take
it
for
granted
that
slavery
is
a
lamentable
nevertheless
there
a
way
to
effect
its
cure
if
we
all
join
sincerely
earnestly
and
kindly
in
the
work
but
if
we
expend
our
energies
in
palliating
the
evil
or
mourning
over
its
hopelessness
or
quarrelling
about
who
is
the
most
to
blame
for
it
the
vessel
crew
passengers
and
all
will
go
down
together
i
object
to
the
colonization
society
because
it
tends
to
put
public
opinion
asleep
on
a
subject
where
it
needs
to
be
wide
awake
the
address
above
alluded
to
does
indeed
inform
us
of
one
thing
which
we
are
at
liberty
to
do
we
must
to
the
master
and
him
by
all
the
sacred
rights
of
humanity
by
all
the
laws
of
natural
justice
by
his
dread
responsibilities
which
in
the
economy
of
providence
are
always
and
commensurate
with
power
to
the
out
of
his
abyss
of
degradation
to
give
him
a
participation
in
the
benefits
of
mortal
existence
and
to
make
him
a
member
of
the
and
moral
world
from
which
he
and
his
fathers
for
so
many
generations
have
been
exiled
the
practical
of
such
a
plan
needs
no
comment
will
smile
when
they
read
it
i
will
for
a
moment
glance
at
what
many
suppose
is
still
the
intention
of
the
colonization
society
gradually
to
remove
all
the
blacks
in
the
united
states
the
society
has
been
in
operation
more
than
fifteen
years
during
which
it
has
transported
between
two
and
three
thousand
people
of
color
there
are
in
the
united
states
two
million
of
slaves
and
three
hundred
thousand
free
blacks
and
their
numbers
are
increasing
at
the
rate
of
seventy
thousand
annually
while
the
society
have
removed
less
than
three
thousand
five
hundred
thousand
have
been
born
while
one
hundred
and
fifty
blacks
have
been
sent
to
africa
in
a
two
hundred
have
been
born
in
a
to
keep
the
evil
just
where
it
is
seventy
thousand
a
year
must
be
transported
how
many
ships
and
how
many
millions
of
money
would
it
require
to
do
this
it
would
cost
three
million
five
hundred
thousand
dollars
a
year
to
provide
for
the
safety
of
our
southern
brethren
in
this
way
to
use
the
language
of
hayne
it
would
bankrupt
the
treasury
of
the
world
to
execute
the
scheme
and
if
such
a
great
number
could
be
removed
annually
how
would
the
poor
fellows
subsist
famines
have
already
been
produced
even
by
the
few
that
have
been
sent
what
would
be
the
result
of
landing
several
thousand
destitute
beings
even
on
the
most
fertile
of
our
own
cultivated
shores
and
why
they
be
removed
labor
is
greatly
needed
and
we
are
glad
to
give
good
wages
for
it
we
encourage
emigration
from
all
parts
of
the
world
why
is
it
not
good
policy
as
well
as
good
feeling
to
improve
the
colored
people
and
pay
them
for
the
use
of
their
faculties
for
centuries
to
come
the
means
of
sustenance
in
this
vast
country
must
be
much
greater
than
the
population
then
why
should
we
drive
away
people
whose
services
may
be
most
useful
if
the
moral
cultivation
of
negroes
received
the
attention
it
ought
thousands
and
thousands
would
at
the
present
moment
be
gladly
taken
up
in
families
factories
and
like
other
men
they
ought
to
be
allowed
to
fit
themselves
for
more
important
usefulness
as
far
and
as
fast
as
they
can
there
will
in
all
human
probability
never
be
any
decrease
in
the
black
population
of
the
united
states
here
they
are
and
here
they
must
remain
in
very
large
numbers
do
what
we
will
we
may
at
once
agree
to
live
together
in
mutual
and
perform
a
mutual
use
to
each
other
or
we
may
go
on
increasing
tyranny
on
one
side
and
jealousy
and
revenge
on
the
other
until
the
fearful
elements
complete
their
work
of
destruction
and
something
better
than
this
sinful
republic
rises
on
the
ruins
oh
how
earnestly
do
i
wish
that
we
may
choose
the
holier
and
safer
path
to
transport
the
blacks
in
such
annual
numbers
as
has
hitherto
been
done
can
not
have
any
beneficial
effect
upon
the
present
state
of
things
it
is
dame
partington
with
her
pail
mopping
up
the
rushing
waters
of
the
atlantic
so
far
as
this
gradual
removal
any
effect
it
tends
to
keep
up
the
price
of
slaves
in
the
market
and
thus
perpetuate
the
system
a
writer
in
the
kentucky
luminary
speaking
of
colonization
uses
the
following
argument
none
are
obliged
to
follow
our
example
and
those
who
do
not
find
the
value
of
their
negroes
increased
by
the
departure
of
if
the
value
of
slaves
is
kept
up
it
will
be
a
strong
temptation
to
smuggle
in
the
commodity
and
thus
while
one
vessel
carries
them
out
from
america
another
will
be
bringing
them
in
from
africa
this
would
be
like
dipping
up
the
water
of
chesapeake
bay
into
barrels
conveying
it
across
the
atlantic
and
emptying
it
into
the
mediterranean
the
chesapeake
would
remain
as
full
as
ever
and
by
the
time
the
vessel
returned
wind
and
waves
would
have
brought
the
water
back
again
have
never
yet
in
any
part
of
the
world
been
known
to
favor
as
a
body
any
scheme
which
could
ultimately
to
abolish
slavery
yet
in
this
country
they
belong
to
the
colonization
society
in
large
numbers
and
agree
to
pour
from
their
state
treasuries
into
its
funds
individuals
object
to
it
it
is
true
but
the
scheme
is
very
generally
favored
in
the
slave
states
the
following
extract
from
wood
speech
in
the
legislature
of
virginia
will
show
upon
what
ground
the
owners
of
slaves
are
willing
to
sanction
any
schemes
of
benevolence
the
colonization
society
may
be
a
part
of
the
grand
system
of
the
ruler
of
the
universe
to
provide
for
the
transfer
of
negroes
to
their
country
their
introduction
into
this
land
may
have
been
one
of
the
inscrutable
ways
of
providence
to
confer
blessings
upon
that
race
it
may
have
been
decreed
that
they
shall
be
the
means
of
conveying
to
the
minds
of
their
benighted
countrymen
the
blessing
of
religious
and
civil
liberty
but
i
fear
there
is
little
ground
to
believe
the
means
have
yet
been
created
to
effect
so
glorious
a
result
or
that
the
present
race
of
slaves
are
to
be
benefited
by
such
a
removal
shall
trust
that
many
of
them
may
be
carried
to
the
states
as
should
this
door
be
closed
how
can
virginia
get
rid
of
so
large
a
number
as
are
now
annually
deported
to
the
different
states
and
territories
where
slaves
are
wanted
can
the
gentleman
show
us
how
from
thousand
to
twenty
can
be
carried
to
liberia
yet
notwithstanding
such
numbers
of
mothers
and
children
are
yearly
sent
from
a
single
state
separately
or
in
lots
to
supply
the
demands
of
the
internal
hayne
speaking
of
these
people
and
sending
them
away
says
it
is
wholly
irreconcilable
with
our
notions
of
humanity
to
asunder
the
tender
which
they
had
formed
among
us
to
gratify
the
feelings
of
a
false
philanthropy
as
for
the
of
blacks
from
this
country
the
real
fact
is
this
the
slave
states
are
very
desirous
to
get
rid
of
their
troublesome
of
colored
population
and
they
are
willing
that
we
should
help
to
pay
for
the
transportation
a
double
purpose
is
served
by
this
for
the
active
benevolence
which
is
eager
to
work
in
the
cause
is
thus
turned
into
a
harmless
and
convenient
channel
neither
the
planters
nor
the
colonization
society
seem
to
ask
what
we
have
to
remove
people
from
the
places
where
they
have
been
born
and
brought
up
where
they
have
a
home
which
however
miserable
is
still
their
home
and
where
their
relatives
and
acquaintances
all
reside
africa
is
no
more
their
native
country
than
england
is
ours
af
nay
it
is
less
so
because
there
is
no
community
of
language
or
habits
besides
we
can
not
say
to
them
as
gilpin
said
to
his
horse
was
for
pleasure
you

you

go

footnote
af
at
the
close
of
the
last
war
general
jackson
issued
a
proclamation
to
the
colored
people
of
the
south
in
which
he
says
i
knew
that
you
the
land
of
your
and
that
like
ourselves
you
had
to
defend
all
that
is
dear
to
man
but
you
surpass
my
hopes
i
have
found
in
you
united
to
those
qualities
that
noble
enthusiasm
which
impels
to
great
deeds
in
the
virginia
debate
of
it
was
agreed
that
very
few
of
the
free
colored
people
would
be
to
go
to
africa
and
this
is
proved
by
several
petitions
from
them
praying
for
leave
to
remain
one
of
the
virginian
legislators
said
either
or
force
must
be
used
to
compel
them
to
go
some
of
them
advised
immediate
coercion
others
recommended
persuasion
first
until
their
numbers
were
thinned
and
coercion
afterward
i
believe
the
resolution
finally
passed
the
house
without
any
proviso
of
this
sort
and
i
mention
it
merely
to
show
that
it
was
generally
supposed
the
colored
people
would
be
unwilling
to
go
the
planters
are
resolved
to
drive
the
free
blacks
away
and
it
is
another
evil
of
the
colonization
society
that
their
funds
and
their
influence
with
them
in
this
project
they
do
not
indeed
thrust
the
free
negroes
off
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
but
they
make
their
and
so
very
unequal
and
oppressive
that
the
poor
fellows
are
surrounded
by
raging
fires
on
every
side
and
must
leap
into
the
atlantic
for
safety
in
slave
ethics
i
suppose
this
is
called
force
if
the
slave
population
is
left
to
its
own
natural
increase
the
crisis
will
soon
come
for
labor
will
be
so
very
cheap
that
slavery
will
not
be
for
the
interest
of
the
whites
why
should
we
retard
this
crisis
in
the
next
place
many
of
the
colonizationists
i
do
not
suppose
it
applies
to
all
are
averse
to
giving
the
blacks
a
good
education
and
they
are
not
friendly
to
the
establishment
of
schools
and
colleges
for
that
purpose
now
i
would
ask
any
candid
person
why
colored
children
should
be
educated
some
say
it
will
raise
them
above
their
situation
i
answer
it
will
raise
them
their
situation
not
it
when
a
high
school
for
white
girls
was
first
talked
of
in
this
city
several
of
the
wealthy
class
objected
to
it
because
said
they
if
everybody
is
educated
we
shall
have
no
servants
this
argument
is
based
on
selfishness
and
therefore
can
not
stand
if
carried
into
operation
the
welfare
of
many
would
be
sacrificed
to
the
convenience
of
a
few
we
might
as
well
protest
against
the
sunlight
for
the
benefit
of
merchants
of
all
monopolies
a
monopoly
of
is
the
worst
let
it
be
as
active
as
the
ocean
as
free
as
the
wind
as
universal
as
the
sunbeams
lord
brougham
said
very
wisely
if
the
higher
classes
are
afraid
of
being
left
in
the
rear
they
likewise
must
hasten
onward
with
our
firm
belief
in
the
natural
inferiority
of
negroes
it
is
strange
we
should
be
so
much
afraid
that
knowledge
will
elevate
them
quite
too
high
for
our
convenience
in
the
march
of
improvement
we
are
several
centuries
in
advance
and
if
with
this
obstacle
at
the
very
beginning
they
can
outstrip
us
why
then
in
the
name
of
justice
let
them
go
ahead
nay
give
them
three
cheers
as
they
pass
if
any
nation
or
any
class
of
men
can
obtain
intellectual
it
is
a
sure
sign
they
deserve
it
and
by
this
republican
rule
the
condition
of
the
world
will
be
regulated
as
surely
as
the
waters
find
their
level
besides
like
all
selfish
policy
this
is
not
policy
the
more
useful
knowledge
a
person
has
the
better
he
fulfils
his
duties
in
station
and
there
is
no
kind
of
knowledge
high
or
low
which
may
not
be
brought
into
but
it
has
been
said
that
information
will
make
the
blacks
discontented
because
if
ever
so
learned
they
will
not
be
allowed
to
sit
at
the
white
man
table
or
marry
the
white
man
daughter
in
relation
to
this
question
i
would
ask
is
there
anybody
so
high
that
they
do
not
see
others
above
them
the
working
classes
of
this
country
have
no
social
communication
with
the
aristocracy
every
day
of
my
life
i
see
people
who
can
dress
better
and
live
in
better
houses
than
i
can
afford
there
are
many
individuals
who
would
not
choose
to
make
my
acquaintance
because
i
am
not
of
their
but
i
should
speak
a
great
untruth
if
i
said
this
made
me
discontented
they
have
their
path
and
i
have
mine
i
am
happy
in
my
own
way
and
am
willing
they
should
be
happy
in
theirs
if
asked
whether
what
little
knowledge
i
have
produces
discontent
i
should
answer
that
it
made
me
happier
infinitely
happier
than
i
could
be
without
it
under
every
form
of
government
there
will
be
distinct
classes
of
society
which
have
only
occasional
and
transient
communication
with
each
other
and
the
colored
people
whether
educated
or
not
will
form
one
of
these
classes
by
giving
them
means
of
information
we
increase
their
happiness
and
make
them
better
members
of
society
i
have
often
heard
it
said
that
there
was
a
disproportionate
number
of
crimes
committed
by
the
colored
people
in
this
state
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
first
generation
of
irish
emigrants
but
we
universally
attribute
it
to
their
ignorance
and
agree
that
the
only
remedy
is
to
give
their
children
as
good
an
education
as
possible
if
the
policy
is
wise
in
one
instance
why
would
it
not
be
so
in
the
other
as
for
the
possibility
of
social
intercourse
between
the
different
colored
races
have
not
the
slightest
objection
to
it
provided
they
were
equally
virtuous
and
equally
intelligent
but
i
do
not
wish
to
war
with
the
prejudices
of
others
i
am
willing
that
all
who
consult
their
consciences
should
keep
them
as
long
as
ever
they
can
one
thing
is
certain
the
blacks
will
never
come
into
your
houses
unless
you
them
and
you
need
not
ask
them
unless
you
choose
they
are
very
far
from
being
intrusive
in
this
respect
with
regard
to
marrying
your
daughters
i
believe
the
feeling
in
opposition
to
such
unions
is
quite
as
strong
among
the
colored
class
as
it
is
among
white
people
while
the
prejudice
exists
such
instances
must
be
exceedingly
rare
because
the
consequence
is
degradation
in
society
believe
me
you
may
safely
trust
to
any
thing
that
depends
on
the
pride
and
selfishness
of
unregenerated
human
nature
perhaps
a
hundred
years
hence
some
negro
rothschild
may
come
from
hayti
with
his
seventy
of
pounds
and
persuade
some
white
woman
to
herself
to
stranger
things
than
this
do
happen
every
but
before
that
century
has
passed
away
i
apprehend
there
will
be
a
sufficient
number
of
and
elegant
colored
women
in
the
world
to
meet
the
demands
of
colored
patricians
let
the
sons
and
daughters
of
africa
be
educated
and
then
they
will
be
fit
for
each
other
they
will
not
be
forced
to
make
war
upon
their
white
neighbors
for
wives
nor
will
they
if
they
have
intelligent
women
of
their
own
see
any
thing
so
very
desirable
in
the
project
shall
we
keep
this
class
of
people
in
everlasting
degradation
for
fear
one
of
their
descendants
marry
our
while
the
prejudice
exists
such
unions
can
not
take
place
and
when
the
prejudice
is
melted
away
they
will
cease
to
be
a
degradation
and
of
course
cease
to
be
an
evil
my
third
and
greatest
objection
to
the
colonization
society
is
that
its
members
write
and
speak
both
in
public
and
private
as
if
the
prejudice
against
skins
darker
colored
than
our
own
was
a
fixed
and
unalterable
law
of
our
nature
which
can
not
possibly
be
changed
the
very
of
the
society
is
owing
to
this
prejudice
for
if
we
could
make
all
the
colored
people
white
or
if
they
could
be
viewed
as
impartially
as
if
they
were
white
what
would
be
left
for
the
colonization
society
to
do
under
such
circumstances
they
would
have
a
fair
chance
to
rise
in
their
moral
and
intellectual
character
and
we
should
be
glad
to
have
them
remain
among
us
to
give
their
energies
for
our
money
as
the
irish
the
dutch
and
people
from
all
parts
of
the
world
are
now
doing
i
am
aware
that
some
of
the
colonizationists
make
large
professions
on
this
subject
but
nevertheless
we
are
constantly
told
by
this
society
that
people
of
color
must
be
removed
not
only
because
they
are
in
our
way
but
because
they
always
be
in
a
state
of
degradation
here
that
they
never
have
all
the
rights
and
privileges
of
citizens
and
all
this
is
because
the
is
so
great
the
managers
consider
it
clear
that
causes
exist
and
are
operating
to
prevent
their
the
blacks
improvement
and
elevation
to
any
considerable
extent
as
a
class
in
this
country
which
are
fixed
not
only
beyond
the
control
of
the
friends
of
humanity
but
of
any
human
power
will
do
for
them
what
it
will
do
for
them
in
this
is
not
the
fault
of
the
colored
man
nor
christianity
but
ordination
of
and
no
more
to
be
changed
than
the
laws
of
nature
annual

vol
iv
pp
this
is
shaking
hands
with
iniquity
and
covering
sin
with
a
silver
veil
our
prejudice
against
the
blacks
is
founded
in
sheer
pride
and
it
originates
in
the
circumstance
that
people
of
their
color
only
are
universally
allowed
to
be
slaves
we
made
slavery
and
slavery
makes
the
prejudice
no
christian
who
questions
his
own
conscience
can
justify
himself
in
indulging
the
feeling
the
removal
of
this
prejudice
is
not
a
matter
of
opinion
it
is
a
matter
of
we
have
no
right
to
palliate
a
feeling
sinful
in
itself
and
highly
injurious
to
a
large
number
of
our
let
us
no
longer
act
upon
the
idea
that
we
must
always
continue
to
do
wrong
because
we
have
so
long
been
in
the
habit
of
doing
it
that
there
is
no
for
the
prejudice
is
shown
by
facts
in
england
it
exists
to
a
much
less
degree
than
it
does
here
if
a
respectable
colored
person
enters
a
church
there
the
pews
are
readily
opened

him
if
he
appears
at
an
inn

a
highly
respectable

residing

has
often
remarked
that
nothing
filled
him
with
such
utter
astonishment

prejudice

regard
to

there
is
now
in

acquainted

unfortunate

became
free
by
the
kindness
of
an
individual

has
now
a
handsome
little

the
command
of
a

must
take
care
not

the
anecdote
of
prince
saunders
is
well
known
but
it
will
bear
repeating
he
called
upon
an
american
family
then
residing
in
london
the
fashionable
breakfast
hour
was
very
late
and
the
family
were
still
seated
at
the
table
the
lady
fidgetted
between
the
contending
claims
of
politeness
and
prejudice
at
last
when
all
but
herself
had
risen
from
the
table
she
said
as
if

by
a
sudden
thought

i
forgot
to
ask
if
you
had
breakfasted
i
thank
you

replied
the
colored
gentleman
but
i
have
engaged
to
breakfast
with
the
prince

this
morning
wilberforce
and
brougham
have
often
been
seen
in
the
streets
of
london
walking
arm
in
arm
with
people
of
color
the
same
thing
is
true
of
brissot
la
fayette
and
several
other
distinguished
frenchmen
in
this
city
i
never
but
once
saw
such
an
instance
when
the
philadelphia
company
were
here
last
summer
i
met
one
of
the
officers
walking
arm
in
arm
with
a
black
musician
the
circumstance
gave
me
a
good
deal
of
respect
for
the
white
man
for
i
thought
he
must
have
kind
feelings
and
correct
principles
thus
fearlessly
to
throw
off
a
worse
than
idle
prejudice
in
brazil
people
of
color
are
lawyers
clergymen
merchants
and
military
officers
and
in
the
portuguese
as
well
as
the
spanish
settlements
intermarriages
bring
no
degradation
on
the
shores
of
the
levant
some
of
the
wealthiest
merchants
are
black
if
we
were
accustomed
to
see
intelligent
and
polished
negroes
the
prejudice
would
soon
disappear
there
is
certainly
no
law
of
our
nature
which
makes
a
repugnant
to
our
feelings
we
admire
the
swarthy
beauties
of
spain
and
the
finest
forms
of
statuary
are
often
preferred
in
bronze
if
the
whole
world
were
allowed
to
vote
on
the
question
there
would
probably
be
a
plurality
in
favor
of
complexions
decidedly
dark
every
body
knows
how
much
the
africans
were
amused
at
the
sight
of
mungo
park
and
what
an
ugly
misfortune
they
considered
his
pale
color
prominent
nose
and
thin
lips
ought
we
to
be
called
christians
if
we
allow
a
prejudice
so
absurd
to
prevent
the
improvement
of
a
large
portion
of
the
human
race
and
interfere
with
what
all
civilized
nations
consider
the
most
common
rights
of
mankind
it
can
not
be
that
my
enlightened
and
generous
countrymen
will
sanction
any
thing
so
and
so
selfish
having
found
much
fault
with
the
colonization
society
it
is
pleasant
to
believe
that
one
portion
of
their
enterprise
affords
a
distant
prospect
of
doing
more
good
than
evil
they
now
principally
seek
to
direct
the
public
attention
to
the
founding
of
a
colony
in
africa
and
this
may
prove
beneficial
in
process
of
time
if
the
colored
emigrants
were
before
they
went
there
such
a
colony
would
tend
slowly
but
certainly
to
enlighten
africa
to
raise
the
character
of
the
negroes
to
strengthen
the
increasing
liberality
of
public
opinion
and
to
check
the
diabolical
if
the
colonizationists
will
work
zealously
and
judiciously
in
this
department
pretend
to
do
nothing
more
and
let
others
work
in
another
and
more
efficient
way
they
will
deserve
the
thanks
of
the
country
but
while
it
is
believed
that
they
do
all
the
good
which
be
done
in
this
important
cause
they
will
do
more
harm
in
america
than
they
can
atone
for
in
africa
very
different
pictures
are
drawn
of
liberia
one
party
represents
it
as
thriving
beyond
description
the
other
insists
that
it
will
soon
fall
into
ruin
it
is
but
candid
to
suppose
that
the
colony
is
going
on
as
well
as
could
possibly
be
expected
when
we
consider
that
the
emigrants
are
almost
universally
ignorant
and
vicious
without
property
and
without
habits
of
industry
or
enterprise
the
colored
people
in
our
slave
states
must
almost
without
exception
be
destitute
of
information
and
in
choosing
negroes
to
send
away
the
masters
would
be
very
apt
to
select
the
most
helpless
and
the
most
refractory
hence
the
superintendents
of
liberia
have
made
reiterated
complaints
of
being
flooded
with
shiploads
of
vagrants
these
causes
are
powerful
drawbacks
but
the
negroes
in
liberia
have
schools
and
churches
and
they
have
freedom
which
wherever
it
exists
is
always
striving
to
work
its
upward
way
there
is
a
palpable
contradiction
in
some
of
the
statements
of
this
society
we
are
told
that
the
colonization
society
is
to
civilize
and
evangelize
africa
says
henry
clay
the
ablest
advocate
which
the
society
has
yet
found
a
carrying
with
him
in
the
holy
cause
of
civilization
religion
and
free
institutions
who
are
these
emigrants
these
the
free
people
of
color
and
they
says
the
african
repository
qualified
for
colonizing
africa
what
are
their
let
the
society
answer
in
its
own
words
blacks
are
a
greater
nuisance
than
even
slaves
themselves
vol
ii
horde
of
miserable
people
the
objects
of
universal
suspicion
subsisting
by
anomalous
race
of
beings
the
most
debased
upon
earth
vol
vii
all
classes
of
our
population
the
most
vicious
is
that
of
the
free
colored
annual
report
of
colonization
an
education
society
has
been
formed
in
connection
with
the
colonization
society
and
their
complaint
is
principally
that
they
can
not
find
proper
subjects
for
instruction
why
can
not
such
subjects
be
found
simply
because
our
ferocious
prejudices
compel
the
colored
children
to
grow
up
in
ignorance
and
vicious
companionship
and
when
we
seek
to
educate
them
we
find
their
minds
closed
against
the
genial
influence
of
knowledge
when
i
heard
of
the
education
society
i
did
hope
to
find
one
instance
of
for
the
blacks
but
in
the
constitution
of
that
society
i
again
find
the
selfish
principle
predominant
they
pledge
themselves
to
educate
no
colored
persons
unless
they
are
solemnly
bound
to
the
the
abolitionists
are
told
that
they
must
wait
till
the
slaves
are
more
fit
for
freedom
but
if
this
system
is
pursued
when
are
they
to
be
more
fit
for
freedom
never
never
to
the
end
of
time
whatever
other
good
the
colonization
society
may
do
it
seems
to
me
evident
that
they
do
not
produce
beneficial
effect
on
the
condition
of
colored
people
in
america
and
indirectly
they
produce
much
evil
in
a
body
so
numerous
as
the
colonization
society
there
is
of
course
a
great
variety
of
character
and
opinions
i
presume
that
many
among
them
believe
the
ultimate
tendency
of
the
society
to
be
very
different
from
what
it
really
is
some
encourage
it
because
they
think
it
can
not
decrease
slavery
and
will
keep
back
the
inconvenient
crisis
when
free
labor
will
be
cheaper
than
slave
labor
others
of
the
same
class
join
it
because
they
really
want
to
do
some
act
of
kindness
to
the
unfortunate
african
race
and
all
the
country
insist
upon
it
that
this
is
the
only
way
some
politicians
in
the
free
states
countenance
it
from
similar
motives
and
because
less
cautious
measures
might
occasion
a
loss
of
southern
votes
and
influence
the
class
so
numerous
in
every
community
who
are
always
ready
to
flatter
existing
prejudices
and
sail
smoothly
along
the
current
of
popular
favor
join
it
of
course
but
i
am
willing
to
believe
that
the
largest
proportion
belong
to
it
because
they
have
compassionate
hearts
are
fearful
of
injuring
their
southern
brethren
and
really
think
there
is
no
other
way
of
doing
so
much
good
to
the
negroes
with
this
class
i
sympathize
in
feeling
but
differ
in
opinion
the
society
was
formed
in
january
its
objects
are
distinctly
stated
in
the
second
article
of
their
constitution
which
is
as
follows
art
the
objects
of
the
society
shall
be
to
endeavor
by
all
means
sanctioned
by
law
humanity
and
religion
to
effect
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
united
states
to
improve
the
character
and
condition
of
the
free
people
of
color
to
inform
and
correct
public
opinion
in
relation
to
their
situation
and
rights
and
obtain
for
them
equal
civil
and
political
rights
and
privileges
with
the
whites
from
this
it
will
be
seen
that
they
think
it
a
duty
to
give
colored
people
all
possible
means
of
education
and
instead
of
removing
them
away
from
the
prejudice
to
remove
the
prejudice
away
from
them
they
lay
it
down
as
a
maxim
that
immediate
emancipation
is
the
only
just
course
and
the
only
safe
policy
they
say
that
slavery
is
a
common
evil
and
therefore
there
is
a
common
right
to
investigate
it
and
search
for
modes
of
relief
they
say
that
shares
and
ever
has
shared
in
this
national
sin
and
is
therefore
bound
to
atone
for
the
mischief
as
far
as
it
can
be
done
the
strongest
reason
why
the
society
wish
for
the
emancipation
of
slaves
is
because
they
think
no
other
course
can
be
pursued
which
does
not
in
its
very
nature
involve
a
constant
violation
of
the
laws
of
god
in
the
next
place
they
believe
there
is
no
other
sure
way
of
providing
for
the
safety
of
the
white
population
in
the
slave
states
i
know
that
many
of
the
planters
affect
to
laugh
at
the
idea
of
fearing
their
slaves
but
why
are
their
laws
framed
with
such
cautious
vigilance
why
must
not
negroes
of
different
plantations
communicate
together
why
are
they
not
allowed
to
be
out
in
the
evening
or
to
carry
even
a
stick
to
defend
themselves
in
case
of
necessity
in
the
virginia
legislature
a
gentleman
said
it
was
high
time
for
something
to
be
done
when
men
did
not
dare
to
open
their
own
doors
without
pistols
at
their
belts
and
randolph
has
publicly
declared
that
a
planter
was
merely
a
sentry
at
his
own
door
roane
of
virginia
asks
is
there
an
intelligent
man
who
does
not
know
that
this
of
slavery
is
increasing
and
will
continue
to
increase
in
a
ratio
which
is
alarming
in
the
extreme
and
must
overwhelm
our
descendants
in
ruin
why
then
should
we
shut
our
eyes
and
turn
our
backs
upon
the
evil
will
delay
render
it
less
gigantic
or
give
us
more
herculean
strength
to
meet
and
subdue
it
at
a
future
time
oh
no
delay
breeds
danger
procrastination
is
the
thief
of
time
and
the
refuge
of
sluggards
it
is
very
true
that
insurrection
is
perfect
madness
on
the
part
of
the
slaves
for
they
are
sure
to
be
overpowered
but
such
madness
has
happened
and
innocent
women
and
children
have
fallen
victims
to
it
a
few
months
ago
i
was
conversing
with
a
very
mild
and
judicious
member
of
the
society
when
a
gentleman
originally
from
the
south
came
in
as
he
was
an
old
acquaintance
and
had
been
a
long
time
resident
in
it
was
not
deemed
necessary
as
a
matter
of
courtesy
to
drop
the
conversation
he
soon
became
excited
whatever
you
may
think
child
said
he
the
slaves
are
a
great
deal
happier
than
either
of
us
the
less
people
know
the
more
merry
they
are
i
replied
i
heard
you
a
short
time
since
talking
over
your
plans
for
educating
your
son
if
knowledge
brings
wretchedness
why
do
you
not
keep
him
in
happy
ignorance
the
fashion
of
the
times
requires
some
information
said
he
but
why
do
you
concern
yourself
about
the
negroes
why
do
you
excite
the
horses
to
an
insurrection
because
they
are
obliged
to
work
and
are
whipped
if
they
do
not
one
does
not
whip
another
said
i
and
besides
i
do
not
wish
to
promote
insurrections
i
would
on
the
contrary
do
all
i
could
to
prevent
them
perhaps
you
do
not
like
the
comparison
between
slaves
and
horses
rejoined
he
it
is
true
the
horses
have
the
advantage
i
made
no
reply
for
where
such
ground
is
assumed
what
be
said
besides
i
did
not
then
and
i
do
not
now
believe
that
he
expressed
his
real
feelings
he
was
piqued
and
spoke
unadvisedly
this
gentleman
denied
that
the
lot
of
the
negroes
was
hard
he
said
they
loved
their
masters
and
their
masters
loved
them
and
in
any
cases
of
trouble
or
illness
a
man
slaves
were
his
best
friends
i
mentioned
some
undoubted
instances
of
cruelty
to
slaves
he
acknowledged
that
such
instances
might
very
rarely
happen
but
said
that
in
general
the
masters
were
much
more
to
be
pitied
than
the
negroes
a
lady
who
had
been
in
south
carolina
when
an
insurrection
was
apprehended
related
several
anecdotes
concerning
the
alarm
that
prevailed
there
at
the
time
and
added
i
often
wish
that
none
of
my
friends
lived
in
a
slave
state
why
should
you
be
anxious
rejoined
the
southern
gentleman
you
know
that
they
have
built
a
strong
citadel
in
the
heart
of
the
city
to
which
all
the
inhabitants
can
repair
in
case
of
insurrection
so
said
i
they
have
built
a
to
protect
them
from
their
happy
contented
servants
a
citadel
against
their
i
could
not
but
be
amused
at
the
contradictions
that
occurred
during
this
conversation
that
emancipation
has
in
several
instances
been
effected
with
safety
has
been
already
shown
but
allowing
that
there
is
some
danger
in
discontinuing
slavery
is
there
not
likewise
danger
in
continuing
it
in
one
case
the
danger
if
there
were
any
would
soon
be
subdued
in
the
other
it
is
continually
increasing
the
planter
tells
us
that
the
slave
is
very
happy
and
bids
us
leave
him
as
he
is
if
laughter
is
a
sign
of
happiness
the
irishman
tumbling
in
the
same
mire
as
his
pigs
is
happy
the
merely
sensual
man
is
no
doubt
merry
and
heedless
but
who
would
call
him
happy
is
it
not
a
fearful
thing
to
keep
immortal
beings
in
a
state
like
beasts
the
more
the
senses
are
subjected
to
the
moral
and
intellectual
powers
the
happier
man
is
the
more
we
learn
to
sacrifice
the
present
to
the
future
the
higher
do
we
rise
in
the
scale
of
existence
the
negro
may
often
enjoy
himself
like
the
dog
when
he
is
not
beaten
or
the
hog
when
he
is
not
starved
but
let
not
this
be
called
how
far
the
slave
laws
are
conducive
to
the
enjoyment
of
those
they
govern
each
individual
can
judge
for
himself
in
the
southern
papers
we
continually
see
pictures
of
runaway
negroes
and
sometimes
the
advertisements
identify
them
by
scars
or
by
letters
branded
upon
them
is
it
natural
for
men
to
run
away
from
comfort
and
happiness
especially
when
any
one
who
meets
them
may
shoot
them
like
a
dog
and
when
whipping
nearly
unto
death
is
authorized
as
the
punishment
i
forbear
to
describe
how
much
more
shocking
is
than
any
thing
we
are
accustomed
to
see
bestowed
upon
cattle
but
the
advocates
of
slavery
tell
us
that
on
the
negro
own
account
it
is
best
to
keep
him
in
slavery
that
without
a
master
to
guide
him
and
take
care
of
him
he
is
a
wretched
being
that
freedom
is
the
greatest
curse
that
can
be
bestowed
upon
him
then
why
do
their
legislatures
grant
it
as
a
reward
for
services
to
the
why
do
benevolent
masters
bequeath
the
legacy
of
freedom
in
consideration
of
long
and
faithful
service
why
did
jefferson
so
earnestly
and
so
very
humbly
request
the
legislature
of
virginia
to
ratify
the
manumission
of
his
five
slaves
notwithstanding
the
disadvantageous
position
of
free
negroes
in
a
community
consisting
of
whites
and
slaves
it
is
evident
that
even
upon
these
terms
freedom
is
considered
a
blessing
the
society
agree
with
harriet
martineau
in
saying
patience
with
the
but
no
patience
with
the
as
much
patience
as
you
please
in
enlightening
those
who
are
unaware
of
the
abuses
but
no
patience
with
social
crimes
the
colonization
society
are
always
reminding
us
that
the
has
rights
as
well
as
the
slave
the
society
urge
us
to
remember
that
the
has
rights
as
well
as
the
master
i
leave
it
for
sober
sense
to
determine
which
of
these
claims
is
in
the
greatest
danger
of
being
forgotten
the
abolitionists
think
it
a
duty
to
maintain
at
all
times
and
in
all
places
that
slavery
to
be
abolished
and
that
it
be
abolished
when
error
is
so
often
repeated
it
becomes
very
important
to
repeat
the
truth
especially
as
good
men
are
apt
to
be
quiet
and
selfish
men
are
prone
to
be
active
they
propose
no
they
leave
that
to
the
wisdom
of
legislatures
but
they
never
swerve
from
the
that
slavery
is
both
wicked
and
their
object
is
to
turn
the
public
voice
against
this
evil
by
a
plain
exposition
of
facts
perhaps
it
may
seem
of
little
use
for
individuals
to
maintain
any
particular
while
they
do
not
attempt
to
prescribe
the
ways
and
means
by
which
it
can
be
carried
into
operation
but
the
voice
of
the
public
is
mighty
either
for
good
or
evil
and
that
echo
is
composed
of
single
voices
schiller
makes
his
fiesco
exclaim
spread
out
the
thunder
into
its
tones
and
it
becomes
a
lullaby
for
children
pour
it
forth
in
one
quick
peal
and
the
royal
sound
shall
move
the
heavens
if
the
work
of
abolition
must
necessarily
be
slow
in
its
progress
so
much
the
more
need
of
beginning
soon
and
working
vigorously
my
life
upon
it
a
safe
remedy
can
be
found
for
this
evil
whenever
we
are
sincerely
desirous
of
doing
justice
for
its
own
sake
the
society
is
loudly
accused
of
being
seditious
fanatical
and
likely
to
promote
insurrections
it
seems
to
be
supposed
that
they
wish
to
send
fire
and
sword
into
the
south
and
encourage
the
slaves
to
hunt
down
their
masters
wish
to
have
it
viewed
in
this
light
because
they
know
the
subject
will
not
bear
discussion
and
men
here
who
give
the
tone
to
public
opinion
have
loudly
repeated
the
charge
some
from
good
motives
and
some
from
bad
i
once
had
a
very
strong
prejudice
against
i
am
ashamed
to
think
strong
for
mere
prejudice
should
never
be
stubborn
but
a
candid
examination
has
convinced
me
that
i
was
in
an
error
i
made
the
common
mistake
of
taking
things
for
granted
without
stopping
to
investigate
this
society
do
not
wish
to
see
any
coercive
or
dangerous
measures
pursued
they
wish
for
universal
emancipation
because
they
believe
it
is
the
only
way
to
insurrections
almost
every
individual
among
them
is
a
strong
friend
to
peace
societies
they
wish
to
move
the
public
mind
on
this
subject
in
the
same
manner
that
it
has
been
moved
on
other
subjects
by
open
candid
fearless
discussion
this
is
they
want
to
do
and
this
they
are
determined
to
do
because
they
believe
it
to
be
an
important
duty
for
a
long
time
past
public
sympathy
has
been
earnestly
directed
in
the
wrong
way
if
it
could
be
made
to
turn
round
a
most
happy
change
would
be
produced
there
are
many
people
at
the
south
who
would
be
glad
to
have
a
safe
method
of
emancipation
discovered
but
instead
of
encouraging
all
our
presses
and
pulpits
and
books
and
conversation
have
been
used
to
strengthen
the
hands
of
those
who
wish
to
perpetuate
the
costly
iniquity
divine
providence
opens
the
way
for
the
removal
of
evils
individual
or
national
whenever
man
is
sincerely
willing
to
have
them
removed
it
may
be
difficult
to
do
right
but
it
is
never
impossible
yet
a
majority
of
my
countrymen
do
in
effect
hold
the
following
language
we
know
that
this
evil
be
cured
and
we
will
speak
and
publish
our
opinion
on
every
occasion
but
you
must
not
for
your
lives
dare
to
assert
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
our
being
mistaken
if
there
were
any
apparent
wish
to
get
rid
of
this
sin
and
disgrace
i
believe
the
members
of
the
society
would
most
heartily
and
courageously
defend
from
any
risk
they
might
incur
in
a
sincere
effort
to
do
right
they
would
teach
the
negro
that
it
is
the
christian
duty
meekly
and
patiently
to
wrong
but
they
dare
not
excuse
the
white
man
for
continuing
to
the
wrong
they
think
it
unfair
that
all
arguments
on
this
subject
should
be
founded
on
the
convenience
and
safety
of
the
master
they
wish
to
see
the
white
man
claims
have
their
due
weight
but
they
insist
that
the
negro
rights
ought
not
to
be
thrown
out
of
the
balance
at
the
time
a
large
reward
was
offered
for
the
capture
of
garrison
on
the
ground
that
his
paper
excited
insurrections
it
is
a
fact
that
he
had
never
sent
or
caused
to
be
sent
a
single
paper
south
of
mason
and
dixon
line
he
sent
papers
to
some
of
the
leading
politicians
there
but
they
of
course
were
not
the
ones
to
promote
negro
insurrections
but
it
has
been
answered
the
papers
did
find
their
way
there
are
we
then
forbidden
to
publish
our
opinions
upon
an
important
subject
for
fear
will
send
them
is
slavery
to
remain
a
sealed
book
in
this
most
communicative
of
all
ages
and
this
most
inquisitive
of
all
countries
if
so
we
live
under
an
actual
censorship
of
the
press
this
is
like
what
the
irishman
said
of
our
paved
cities
tying
down
the
stones
and
letting
the
mad
dogs
run
loose
if
insurrections
do
occur
they
will
no
doubt
be
attributed
to
the
society
but
we
must
not
forget
that
there
were
insurrections
in
the
west
indies
long
before
the
english
abolitionists
began
their
efforts
and
that
masters
were
murdered
in
this
country
before
the
society
was
thought
of
neither
must
we
forget
that
the
increased
severity
of
the
laws
is
very
likely
to
goad
an
oppressed
people
to
madness
the
very
cruelty
of
the
laws
against
resistance
under
any
circumstances
would
be
thought
to
justify
a
white
man
in
rebellion
because
it
gives
resistance
the
character
of
the
law
says
blackstone
respects
the
passions
of
the
human
mind
and
when
external
violence
is
offered
to
a
man
himself
or
those
to
whom
he
bears
a
near
connexion
makes
it
lawful
in
him
to
do
himself
that
immediate
justice
to
which
he
is
prompted
by
nature
and
which
no
prudential
motives
are
strong
enough
to
restrain
as
it
respects
promoting
insurrections
by
discussing
this
subject
it
should
be
remembered
that
it
is
very
rare
for
any
colored
person
at
the
south
to
know
how
to
read
or
write
furthermore
if
there
be
any
danger
in
the
discussion
silence
can
not
arrest
it
for
the
whole
world
is
talking
and
writing
about
it
a
good
deal
of
commotion
has
been
excited
in
the
south
because
some
mustard
has
arrived
there
packed
in
english
newspapers
containing
parliamentary
speeches
against
slavery
even
children
handkerchiefs
seem
to
be
regarded
as
sparks
falling
into
a
powder
magazine
how
much
better
it
would
be
not
to
live
in
the
midst
of
a
powder
magazine
the
english
abolitionists
have
labored
long
and
arduously
every
inch
of
the
ground
has
been
contested
after
obtaining
the
decision
that
negroes
brought
into
england
were
freemen
it
took
them
to
obtain
the
abolition
of
the
slave
but
their
progress
though
slow
and
difficult
has
been
certain
the
slaves
are
now
emancipated
in
every
british
colony
and
in
effecting
this
happy
change
not
one
drop
of
blood
has
been
spilt
nor
any
property
destroyed
except
two
sheds
called
which
were
set
on
fire
by
some
unknown
hand
in
antigua
and
bermuda
emancipation
was
unqualified
that
is
the
slaves
at
once
received
the
stimulus
of
wages
in
those
islands
there
has
not
been
the
slightest
difficulty
in
the
other
colonies
the
slaves
were
made
apprentices
and
obliged
to
work
five
years
more
before
they
received
their
freedom
and
magistrates
decided
what
proportion
of
time
should
be
employed
for
their
own
benefit
the
planters
had
been
so
violent
in
opposition
to
abolition
and
had
prophesied
such
terrible
disasters
resulting
from
it
that
they
felt
some
anxiety
to
have
their
prophecies
fulfilled
the
abolition
act
by
some
oversight
did
not
stipulate
that
while
the
apprentices
worked
without
wages
they
should
have
all
the
privileges
to
which
they
had
been
accustomed
as
slaves
it
had
been
a
universal
practice
for
one
slave
to
cook
for
all
the
rest
so
that
their
food
was
ready
the
moment
they
left
the
field
and
aged
female
slaves
tended
the
little
children
while
their
mothers
were
at
work
the
planters
changed
this
every
slave
was
obliged
to
go
to
his
cabin
whether
distant
or
near
and
cook
his
own
dinner
and
the
time
thus
lost
must
be
made
up
to
the
masters
from
the
hours
set
apart
for
the
benefit
of
the
apprentices
the
aged
slaves
were
likewise
sent
into
the
field
to
work
while
mothers
were
obliged
to
toil
with
infants
strapped
at
their
backs
under
these
circumstances
the
apprentices
very
naturally
refused
to
work
they
said
we
are
worse
off
than
when
we
were
slaves
for
they
have
taken
away
privileges
to
which
we
were
accustomed
in
bondage
without
paying
us
the
wages
of
freemen
still
under
all
these
provocations
they
offered
merely
resistance
the
worst
enemies
of
the
cause
have
not
been
able
to
discover
that
a
single
life
has
been
lost
in
the
west
indies
or
a
single
plantation
destroyed
in
consequence
of
emancipation
it
is
a
lamentable
proof
of
the
corrupt
state
of
the
american
press
on
the
subject
of
slavery
that
the
irritating
conduct
of
the
west
indian
planters
has
been
passed
over
in
total
silence
while
every
effort
has
been
made
to
represent
the
resistance
of
the
apprentices
as
some
great
and
story
while
the
good
work
was
in
progress
in
england
it
was
for
a
long
time
called
by
every
odious
name
it
was
even
urged
that
the
abolition
of
the
slave
would
encourage
the
massacre
of
white
men
clarkson
who
seems
to
have
been
the
meekest
and
most
patient
of
men
was
stigmatized
as
an
insurrectionist
it
was
said
he
wanted
to
bring
all
the
horrors
of
the
french
revolution
into
england
merely
because
he
wanted
to
abolish
the
slave
it
was
said
liverpool
and
bristol
would
sink
never
to
rise
again
if
that
traffic
were
destroyed
the
insurrection
at
barbadoes
in
was
ascribed
to
the
influence
of
missionaries
infected
with
the
wicked
philanthropy
of
the
age
but
it
was
discovered
that
there
was
no
missionary
on
the
island
at
the
time
of
that
event
nor
for
a
long
time
previous
to
it
the
insurrection
at
demerara
several
years
after
was
publicly
and
angrily
ascribed
to
the
methodist
missionaries
they
were
taken
up
and
imprisoned
and
it
was
lucky
for
these
innocent
men
that
out
of
their
twelve
hundred
black
converts
only
had
joined
the
rebellion
ridicule
and
reproach
has
been
abundantly
heaped
upon
the
laborers
in
this
righteous
cause
power
wealth
talent
pride
and
sophistry
are
all
in
arms
against
them
but
god
and
truth
is
on
their
side
the
cause
of
is
rapidly
gaining
ground
wise
heads
as
well
as
warm
hearts
are
joining
in
its
support
in
a
few
years
i
believe
the
opinion
of
will
be
unanimous
in
its
favor
maine
which
enjoys
the
enviable
distinction
of
never
having
had
a
slave
upon
her
soil
has
formed
an
society
composed
of
her
best
and
most
distinguished
men
those
who
are
determined
to
be
on
the
popular
side
should
be
cautious
how
they
move
just
now
it
is
a
trying
time
for
such
characters
when
public
opinion
is
on
the
verge
of
a
great
change
men
who
upon
the
subject
are
fast
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
slavery
can
never
be
much
ameliorated
while
it
is
allowed
to
exist
what
fox
said
of
the
is
true
of
the
you
may
as
well
try
to
murder
it
is
a
disease
as
deadly
as
the
cancer
and
while
one
particle
of
it
remains
in
the
constitution
no
cure
can
be
effected
the
relation
is
unnatural
in
itself
and
therefore
it
reverses
all
the
rules
which
are
applied
to
other
human
relations
thus
a
free
government
which
in
every
other
point
of
view
is
a
blessing
is
a
curse
to
the
slave
the
liberty
around
him
is
contagious
and
therefore
the
laws
must
be
endowed
with
a
tenfold
crushing
power
or
the
captive
will
break
his
chains
a
despotic
monarch
can
follow
the
impulses
of
humanity
without
scruple
when
vidius
pollio
ordered
one
of
his
slaves
to
be
cut
to
pieces
and
thrown
into
his
the
emperor
augustus
commanded
him
to
emancipate
immediately
not
only
that
slave
but
all
his
slaves
in
a
free
state
there
is
no
such
power
and
there
would
be
none
needed
if
the
laws
were
equal
but
the
are
legislators
and
the
laws
in
which
the
negro
has
no
voice
the
master
influences
public
opinion
but
the
slave
can
not
miss
martineau
very
wisely
says
to
attempt
to
combine
freedom
and
slavery
is
to
put
new
wine
into
old
skins
soon
may
the
old
skins
burst
for
we
shall
never
want
for
better
wine
than
they
have
ever
held
a
work
has
been
lately
published
written
by
jonathan
dymond
who
was
a
member
of
the
society
of
friends
in
england
it
is
entitled
essays
on
the
principles
of
morality
and
most
excellent
essays
they
are
every
sentence
recognises
the
principle
of
sacrificing
all
selfish
considerations
to
our
inward
perceptions
of
duty
and
therefore
every
page
shines
with
the
mild
but
powerful
light
of
true
christian
philosophy
i
rejoice
to
hear
that
the
book
is
likely
to
be
republished
in
this
country
in
his
remarks
on
slavery
the
author
says
the
supporters
of
the
will
hereafter
be
regarded
with
the
same
public
feelings
as
he
who
was
an
advocate
of
the
slave
now
is
how
is
it
that
legislators
and
public
men
are
so
indifferent
to
their
fame
who
would
now
be
willing
that
biography
should
record
of
him
man
defended
the
slave
trade
the
time
will
come
when
the
record
man
opposed
the
abolition
of
will
occasion
a
great
deduction
from
the
public
estimate
of
weight
of
character
chapter
vi
intellect
of
negroes
we
must
not
allow
negroes
to
be
lest
we
ourselves
should
be
suspected
of
not
being
montesquieu
in
order
to
decide
what
is
our
duty
concerning
the
africans
and
their
descendants
we
must
first
clearly
make
up
our
minds
whether
they
are
or
are
not
human
beings
whether
they
have
or
have
not
the
same
capacities
for
improvement
as
other
men
the
intellectual
inferiority
of
the
negroes
is
a
common
though
most
absurd
apology
for
personal
prejudice
and
the
oppressive
inequality
of
the
laws
for
this
reason
i
shall
take
some
pains
to
prove
that
the
present
degraded
condition
of
that
unfortunate
race
is
produced
by
artificial
causes
not
by
the
laws
of
nature
in
the
first
place
naturalists
are
universally
agreed
concerning
the
identity
of
the
type
by
which
they
mean
that
all
living
creatures
that
can
by
any
process
be
enabled
to
perceive
moral
and
intellectual
truths
are
characterized
similar
peculiarities
of
they
may
differ
from
each
other
widely
but
they
still
belong
to
the
same
class
an
eagle
and
a
wren
are
very
unlike
each
other
but
no
one
would
hesitate
to
pronounce
that
they
were
both
birds
so
it
is
with
the
almost
endless
varieties
of
the
monkey
tribe
we
all
know
that
beasts
however
sagacious
are
incapable
of
abstract
thought
or
moral
perception
the
most
wonderful
elephant
in
the
world
could
not
command
an
army
or
govern
a
state
an
may
eat
and
drink
and
dress
and
move
like
a
man
but
he
could
never
write
an
ode
or
learn
to
relinquish
his
own
good
for
the
good
of
his
species
the
conformation
however
it
may
be
altered
by
the
operation
of
physical
or
moral
causes
differs
from
that
of
all
other
beings
and
on
this
ground
the
negro
claim
to
be
ranked
as
a
is
universally
allowed
by
the
learned
the
condition
of
this
people
in
ancient
times
is
very
far
from
indicating
intellectual
or
moral
inferiority
ethiopia
held
a
conspicuous
place
among
the
nations
her
princes
were
wealthy
and
powerful
and
her
people
distinguished
for
integrity
and
wisdom
even
the
proud
grecians
evinced
respect
for
ethiopia
almost
amounting
to
reverence
and
derived
thence
the
sublimest
portions
of
their
mythology
the
popular
belief
that
all
the
gods
made
an
annual
visit
to
the
ethiopians
shows
the
high
estimation
in
which
they
were
held
for
we
are
not
told
that
such
an
honor
was
bestowed
on
any
other
nation
in
the
first
book
of
the
iliad
achilles
is
represented
as
anxious
to
appeal
at
once
to
the
highest
authorities
but
his
mother
tells
him
jupiter
set
off
yesterday
attended
by
all
the
gods
on
a
journey
toward
the
ocean
to
feast
with
the
excellent
ethiopians
and
is
not
expected
back
at
olympus
till
the
twelfth
day
in
ethiopia
was
likewise
placed
the
table
of
the
sun
reported
to
kindle
of
its
own
accord
when
exposed
to
the
rays
of
that
great
luminary
in
africa
was
the
early
reign
of
saturn
under
the
appellation
of
ouranus
or
heaven
there
the
impious
titans
warred
with
the
sky
there
jupiter
was
born
and
nursed
there
was
the
celebrated
shrine
of
ammon
dedicated
to
theban
jove
which
the
greeks
reverenced
more
highly
than
the
delphic
oracle
there
was
the
and
oracle
of
minerva
and
there
atlas
supported
both
the
heavens
and
the
earth
upon
his
shoulders
it
will
be
said
that
fables
prove
nothing
but
there
is
probably
much
deeper
meaning
in
these
fables
than
we
now
understand
there
was
surely
some
reason
for
giving
them
such
a
local
habitation
why
did
the
ancients
represent
minerva
as
born
in
africa
and
why
are
we
told
that
atlas
there
sustained
the
heavens
and
the
earth
unless
they
meant
to
imply
that
africa
was
the
centre
from
which
religious
and
scientific
light
had
been
diffused
some
ancient
writers
suppose
that
egypt
derived
all
the
arts
and
sciences
from
ethiopia
while
others
believe
precisely
the
reverse
diodorus
supported
the
first
opinion
and
asserts
that
the
ethiopian
vulgar
spoke
the
same
language
as
the
learned
of
egypt
it
is
well
known
that
egypt
was
the
great
school
of
knowledge
in
the
ancient
world
it
was
the
of
astronomy
and
we
still
mark
the
constellations
as
they
were
arranged
by
egyptian
shepherds
the
wisest
of
the
grecian
philosophers
among
whom
were
solon
pythagoras
and
plato
went
there
for
instruction
as
our
young
men
now
go
to
england
and
germany
the
eleusinian
mysteries
were
introduced
from
egypt
and
the
important
secret
which
they
taught
is
supposed
to
have
been
the
existence
of
one
invisible
god
a
large
portion
of
grecian
mythology
was
thence
derived
but
in
passing
from
one
country
to
the
other
the
form
of
these
poetical
fables
was
often
preserved
while
the
original
meaning
was
lost
herodotus
the
earliest
of
the
greek
historians
informs
us
that
the
egyptians
were
negroes
this
fact
has
been
much
doubted
and
often
contradicted
but
herodotus
certainly
had
the
best
means
of
knowing
the
truth
on
this
subject
for
he
travelled
in
egypt
and
obtained
his
knowledge
of
the
country
by
personal
observation
he
declares
that
the
colchians
must
be
a
colony
of
egyptians
because
like
them
they
have
a
black
skin
and
frizzled
hair
the
statues
of
the
sphinx
have
the
usual
characteristics
of
the
negro
race
this
opinion
is
confirmed
by
blumenbach
the
celebrated
german
naturalist
and
by
volney
who
carefully
examined
the
architecture
of
egypt
concerning
the
sublimity
of
the
architecture
in
this
ancient
negro
kingdom
some
idea
may
be
conceived
from
the
description
of
thebes
given
by
denon
who
accompanied
the
french
army
into
egypt
this
city
renowned
for
numerous
kings
who
through
their
wisdom
have
been
elevated
to
the
rank
of
gods
for
laws
which
have
been
revered
without
being
known
for
sciences
which
have
been
confided
to
proud
and
mysterious
inscriptions
for
wise
and
earliest
monuments
of
the
arts
which
time
has
respected
this
sanctuary
abandoned
isolated
through
barbarism
and
surrendered
to
the
desert
from
which
it

find
the

learning

improvement
emanating
from
the
continent
of

supposed
to
be
so
degraded
and
accursed
out
of

very

some
persons
are

station
at

pretty

it
is
to
egypt
if
to
any
nation
that
we
must
look
as
the
real
of
the
ancient
and
modern
refinement
of
europe
the
great
lawgiver
of

jews
was
prepared
for
his

mission
by
a
course
of
instruction
in
all
the
wisdom
of
the
egyptians
the
great
assyrian
empires
of
babylon
and
nineveh
hardly
less
illustrious
than
egypt

palestine
or
canaan
before
its
conquest
by
the
jews
is
represented
in
scripture
as
well
as
in
other
histories
as
peopled
by
blacks
and
hence
it
follows
that
tyre
and
carthage
the
most
industrious
wealthy
and
polished
states
of
their
time
were
of
this
color
another
strong
argument
against
the
natural
inferiority
of

may
be
drawn
from
the

the
palace
as
usual
in
africa
consisted
of
a
sort
of
inclosed
town
with
an
open
quadrangle
in

on
entering
the
gate
he
was
conducted
through
three
huts

found

seated
on
a

cottage
bello
had
a
noble
and
commanding
figure
with
a
high
forehead
and
large
black
eyes
he
gave
the
traveller
a
hearty
welcome
and
after
inquiring
the
particulars
of
his
journey
proceeded
to
serious
affairs
he
produced
books
belonging
to
major
denham
which
had
been
taken
in
the
disastrous
battle
of
dirkullah
and
though
he
expressed
a
feeling
of
dissatisfaction
at
the
major
presence
on
that
occasion
readily
accepted
an
apology
and
restored
the
volumes
he
only
asked
to
have
the
subject
of
each
explained
and
to
hear
the
sound
of
the
language
which
he
declared
to
be
beautiful
he
then
began
to
press
his
visiter
with
theological
questions
and
showed
himself
not
wholly
unacquainted
with
the
controversies
which
have
agitated
the
christian
world
indeed
he
soon
went
beyond
the
depth
of
his
visiter
who
was
obliged
to
own
he
was
not
versant
in
the
abstruser
mysteries
of
divinity
the
sultan
now
opened
a
frequent
and
familiar
communication
with
the
english
envoy
in
which
he
showed
himself
possessed
of
a
good
deal
of
information
the
astronomical
instruments
from
which
as
from
implements
of
magic
many
of
his
attendants
started
with
horror
were
examined
by
the
monarch
with
an
intelligent
eye
on
being
shown
the
planisphere
he
proved
his
knowledge
of
the
planets
and
many
of
the
constellations
by
repeating
their
arabic
names
the
telescope
which
presented
objects
inverted
the
compass
by
which
he
could
always
turn
to
the
east
when
praying
and
the
sextant
which
he
called
of
the

excited
peculiar
interest
he
inquired
with
evident
jealousy
into
some
parts
of
english
history
particularly
the
conquest
of
india
and
the
attack
upon
algiers
the

the
capital
of

beneath
whose
high
walls
the

in
majestic

it

the
numerous

equal

the

zhinga
the
negro
queen
of
angola
born
in
like
other
despotic
princes
her
character
is
stained
with
numerous
acts
of
ferocity
and
crime
but
her
great
abilities
can
not
be
for
a
moment
doubted
during
her
brother
reign
zhinga
was
sent
as
ambassadress
to
loanda
to
negotiate
terms
of
peace
with
the
portuguese
a
palace
was
prepared
for
her
reception
and
she
was
received
with
the
honors
due
to
her
rank
on
entering
the
she
perceived
that
a
magnificent
chair
of
state
was
prepared
for
the
portuguese
viceroy
while
in
front
of
it
a
rich
carpet
and
velvet
cushions
embroidered
with
gold
were
arranged
on
the
floor
for
her
use
the
haughty
princess
observed
this
in
silent
displeasure
she
gave
a
signal
with
her
eyes
and
immediately
one
of
her
women
knelt
on
the
carpet
supporting
her
weight
on
her
hands
zhinga
gravely
seated
herself
upon
her
back
and
awaited
the
entrance
of
the
viceroy
the
spirit
and
dignity
with
which
she
fulfilled
her
mission
excited
the
admiration
of
the
whole
court
when
an
alliance
was
offered
upon
the
condition
of
annual
tribute
to
the
king
of
portugal
she
proudly
answered
such
proposals
are
for
a
people
subdued
by
force
of
arms
they
are
unworthy
of
a
powerful
monarch
who
voluntarily
seeks
the
friendship
of
the
portuguese
and
who
scorns
to
be
their
vassal
she
finally
concluded
a
treaty
upon
the
single
condition
of
restoring
all
the
portuguese
prisoners
when
the
audience
was
ended
the
viceroy
as
he
conducted
her
from
the
room
remarked
that
the
attendant
upon
whose
back
she
had
been
seated
still
remained
in
the
same
posture
zhinga
replied
it
is
not
fit
that
the
ambassadress
of
a
great
king
should
be
twice
served
with
the
same
seat
i
have
no
further
use
for
the
woman
charmed
with
the
politeness
of
the
europeans
and
the
evolutions
of
their
troops
the
african
princess
long
delayed
her
departure
having
received
instruction
in
the
christian
religion
she
professed
a
deep
conviction
of
its
truth
whether
this
was
sincere
or
merely
assumed
from
political
motives
is
uncertain
during
her
visit
she
received
baptism
being
then
forty
years
old
she
returned
to
angola
loaded
with
presents
and
honors
her
brother
notwithstanding
a
solemn
promise
to
preserve
the
treaty
she
had
formed
soon
made
war
upon
the
portuguese
he
was
defeated
and
soon
after
died
of
poison
some
said
his
death
was
contrived
by
zhinga
she
ascended
the
throne
and
having
artfully
obtained
possession
of
her
nephew
person
she
strangled
him
with
her
own
hands
revenge
as
well
as
ambition
impelled
her
to
this
crime
for
her
brother
had
many
years
before
murdered
son
lest
he
should
claim
the
crown
the
portuguese
increased
so
fast
in
numbers
wealth
and
power
that
the
people
of
angola
became
jealous
of
them
and
earnestly
desired
war
zhinga
having
formed
an
alliance
with
the
dutch
and
with
several
neighboring
chiefs
began
the
contest
with
great
vigor
she
obtained
several
victories
at
first
but
was
finally
driven
from
her
kingdom
with
great
loss
her
conquerors
offered
to
her
on
the
throne
if
she
would
consent
to
pay
tribute
she
haughtily
replied
if
my
cowardly
are
willing
to
bear
shameful
fetters
can
not
endure
even
the
thought
of
dependence
upon
any
foreign
power
in
order
to
subdue
her
stubborn
spirit
the
portuguese
placed
a
king
of
their
own
choosing
upon
the
throne
of
angola
this
exasperated
zhinga
to
such
a
degree
that
she
vowed
everlasting
hatred
against
her
enemies
and
publicly
abjured
their
religion
at
the
head
of
an
intrepid
and
ferocious
band
she
during
eighteen
years
perpetually
harassed
the
portuguese
she
could
neither
be
subdued
by
force
of
arms
nor
appeased
by
presents
she
demanded
complete
restitution
of
her
territories
and
treated
every
other
proposal
with
the
utmost
scorn
once
when
closely
besieged
in
an
island
she
asked
a
short
time
to
reflect
on
the
terms
of
surrender
the
request
being
granted
she
silently
guided
her
troops
through
the
river
at
midnight
and
carried
fire
and
sword
into
another
portion
of
the
enemy
country
the
total
defeat
of
the
hollanders
and
the
death
of
her
sister
who
had
been
taken
captive
during
the
wars
softened
her
spirit
she
became
filled
with
remorse
for
having
renounced
the
christian
religion
she
treated
her
prisoners
more
mercifully
and
gave
orders
that
the
captive
priests
should
be
attended
with
the
utmost
reverence
they
perceived
the
change
and
lost
no
opportunity
of
regaining
their
convert
the
queen
was
ready
to
comply
with
their
wishes
but
feared
a
revolt
among
her
subjects
and
allies
who
were
strongly
attached
to
the
customs
of
their
fathers
the
priests
by
numerous
artifices
worked
so
powerfully
upon
the
superstitious
fears
of
the
people
that
they
were
prepared
to
hail
zhinga
return
to
the
catholic
faith
with
joy
the
queen
thus
reconciled

her

fiery
zeal

zhinga

years
old
publicly
patronized
marriage
by
espousing
one
of
her
courtiers
and
her
sister
was
induced
to
give
the
same
example
the
portuguese
again
tried
to
make
her
a
vassal
to
the
crown
but
the
priests
notwithstanding
their
almost
unlimited
influence
could
never
obtain
her
consent
to
this
degradation
in
one
of
her
tributaries
having
violated
the
treaty
of
peace
she
marched
at
the
head
of
her
troops
defeated
the
rebel
and
sent
his
head
to
the
portuguese
in
she
made
war
upon
a
neighboring
king
who
had
attacked
her
territories
and
returned
in
triumph
after
having
compelled
him
to
submit
to
such
conditions
as
she
saw
fit
to
impose
the
same
year
she
abolished
the
cruel
custom
of
immolating
human
victims
on
the
tombs
of
princes
and
founded
a
new
city
ornamented
with
a
beautiful
church
and

she
soon
after
sent
an
embassage
to
the
pope
requesting
more
missionaries
among
her
people
the
pontiff
answer
was
publicly
read
in
the
church

zhinga

with
a
numerous
and
brilliant
train
at
a
festival
in
honor
of
this
occasion
she
and
the
ladies
of
her

performed

lislet
established
a
scientific
society
at
the
isle
of

to

some
white

refused

colored

doctor
rush
says
i
conversed
with
him
on
medicine
and
found
him
very
learned
i
thought
i
could
give
him
information
concerning
the
treatment
of
diseases
but
i
learned
from
him
more
than
he
could
expect
from
me
an
african
residing
in
virginia
did
not
know
how
to
read
or
write
but
had
great
facility
in
arithmetical
calculations
he
was
once
asked
how
many
seconds
has
an
individual
lived
when
he
is
seventy
years
seven
months
and
seven
days
old
in
a
minute
and
a
half
he
answered
the
question
one
of
the
company
took
a
pen
and
after
a
long
calculation
said
fuller
had
made
the
sum
too
large
no
replied
the
negro
the
error
is
on
your
side
you
did
not
calculate
the
leap
years
these
facts
are
mentioned
in
a
letter
from
doctor
rush
published
in
the
fifth
volume
of
the
american
museum
in
a
negro
published
at
baltimore
an
essay
against
slavery
addressing
white
men
he
says
is
not
your
conduct
compared
with
your
principles
a
sacrilegious
irony
when
you
dare
to
talk
of
civilization
and
the
gospel
you
pronounce
your
own
anathema
in
you
the
superiority
of
power
produces
nothing
but
a
superiority
of
brutality
and
barbarism
your
fine
political
systems
are
sullied
by
the
outrages
committed
against
human
nature
and
the
divine
majesty
better
known
by
the
name
of
gustavus
vasa
was
stolen
in
africa
at
twelve
years
old
together
with

from

a
horrible
passage
in
a
was
sold
at
barbadoes
being
purchased
by
a
lieutenant
he
accompanied
his
new
master
to
england
guernsey
and
the
siege
of
louisbourg
he
afterwards
experienced
great
changes
of
fortune
and
made
voyages
to
various
parts
of
europe
and
america
in
all
his
wanderings
he
cherished
an
earnest
desire
for
freedom
he
hoped
to
obtain
his
liberty
by
faithfulness
and
zeal
in
his
master
service
but
finding
avarice
stronger
than
benevolence
he
began
trade
with
a
capital
of
three
pence
and
by
rigid
economy
was
at
last
able
to
purchase
own
body
and
this
however
was
not
effected
until
he
had
endured
much
oppression
and
insult
he
was
several
times
shipwrecked
and
finally
after
thirty
years
of
vicissitude
and
suffering
he
settled
in
london
and
published
his
memoirs
the
book
is
said
to
be
written
with
all
the
simplicity
and
something
of
the
roughness
of
uneducated
nature
he
gives
a
description
of
his
terror
at
an
earthquake
his
surprise
when
he
first
saw
snow
a
picture
a
watch
and
a
quadrant
he
always
had
an
earnest
desire
to
understand
navigation
as
a
probable
means
of
one
day
escaping
from
slavery
having
persuaded
a
to
give
him
lessons
he
applied
himself
with
great
diligence
though
obliged
to
contend
with
many
obstacles
and
subject
to
frequent
interruptions
doctor
irving
with
whom
he
once
lived
as
a
servant
taught
him
to
render
salt
water
fresh
by
distillation
some
time
after
when
engaged
in
a
northern
expedition
he
made
good
use
of
this
knowledge
and
furnished
the
crew
with
water
they
could
drink
his
sympathies
were
very
naturally
given
to
the
weak
and
the
despised
wherever
he
found
them
he
deplores
the
fate
of
modern
greeks
nearly
as
much
degraded
by
the
turks
as
the
negroes
are
by
their
white
brethren
in

presented
a
petition
to
the
british
parliament
for

for
the
south
american
slave
market
change
of
climate
killed
his
mother
and
his
father
committed
suicide
at
two
years
old
the
orphan
was
carried
to
england
and
presented
to
some
ladies
residing
at
greenwich
something
in
his
character
reminded
them
of
don
quixote
squire
and
they
added
sancho
to
his
original
name
of
ignatius
the
duke
of
montague
saw
him
frequently
and
thought
he
had
a
mind
worthy
of
cultivation
he
often
sent
him
books
and
advised
the
ladies
to
give
him
a
chance
for
education
but
they
had
less
liberal
views
and
often
threatened
to
send
the
poor
boy
again
into
slavery
after
the
death
of
his
friends
he
went
into
the
service
of
the
duchess
of
montague
who
at
her
death
left
him
an
annuity
of
thirty
pounds
beside
which
he
had
saved
seventy
pounds
out
of
his
earnings
something
of
dissipation
mixed
with
his
love
of
reading
and
sullied
the
better
part
of
his
character
he
spent
his
last
shilling
at
drury
lane
to
see
garrick
who
was
extremely
friendly
to
him
at
one
time
he
thought
of
performing
african
characters
on
the
stage
but
was
prevented
by
a
bad
articulation
he
afterward
became
very
regular
in
his
habits
and
married
a
worthy
west
indian
girl
after
his
death
two
volumes
of
his
letters
were
printed
of
which
a
second
edition
was
soon
published
with
a
portrait
of
the
author
designed
by
gainsborough
and
engraved
by
bartolozzi
sterne
formed
an
acquaintance
with
ignatius
sancho
and
in
the
third
volume
of
his
letters
there
is
an
epistle
addressed
to
this
african
in
which
he
tells
him
that
varieties
in
nature
do
not
sunder
the
bands
of
brotherhood
and
expresses
his
indignation
that
certain
men
wish
to
class
their
equals
among
the
brutes
in
order
to
treat
them
as
such
with
impunity
jefferson
criticises
sancho
with
some
severity
for
yielding
too
much
to
an
eccentric
imagination
but
he
acknowledges
that
he
has
an
easy
style
and
a
happy
choice
of
expressions
the
letters
of
sancho
are
thought
to
bear
some
resemblance
to
those
of
sterne
both
in
their
beauties
and
defects
a
negro
was
born
in
jamaica
the
duke
of
montaigne
governor
of
the
island
thinking
him
an
unusually
bright
boy
sent
him
to
england
to
school
he
afterward
entered
the
university
of
cambridge
and
became
quite
a
proficient
in
mathematics
during
his
stay
in
europe
he
published
a
song
which
became
quite
popular
beginning
welcome
welcome
brother
debtor
after
his
return
to
jamaica
the
duke
tried
to
obtain
a
place
for
him
in
the
council
of
the
government
but
did
not
succeed
he
then
became
a
teacher
of
latin
and
mathematics
he
wrote
a
good
deal
of
latin
verse
a
species
of
composition
of
which
he
was
very
fond
this
negro
is
described
as
having
been
pedantic
and
haughty
indulging
a
profound
contempt
for
men
of
his
own
color
where
learning
is
a
rare
attainment
among
any
people
or
any
class
of
people
this
effect
is
very
apt
to
be
produced
stolen
from
africa
when
seven
or
eight
years
old
was
sold
to
a
wealthy
merchant
in
boston
in
being
an
intelligent
and
winning
child
she
gained
upon
the
affections
of
her
master
family
and
they
allowed
her
uncommon
advantages
when
she
was
nineteen
years
old
a
little
volume
of
her
poems
was
published
and
passed
through
several
editions
both
in
england
and
the
united
states
lest
the
authenticity
of
the
poems
should
be
doubted
her
master
the
governor
the
and
fifteen
other
respectable
persons
acquainted
with
her
character
and
circumstances
testified
that
they
were
really
her
own
productions
jefferson
denies
that
these
poems
have
any
merit
but
i
think
he
would
have
judged
differently
had
he
been
perfectly
unprejudiced
it
would
indeed
be
absurd
to
put
phillis
wheatly
in
competition
with
hemans
mary
hewitt
sigourney
miss
gould
and
other
modern
writers
but
her
productions
certainly
appear
very
respectable
in
comparison
with
most
of
the
poetry
of
that
day
phillis
wheatly
received
her
freedom
in
and
two
years
after
married
a
colored
man
who
like
herself
was
considered
a
prodigy
he
was
at
first
a
grocer
but
afterward
became
a
lawyer
well
known
by
the
name
of
doctor
peter
he
was
in
the
habit
of
pleading
causes
for
his
brethren
before
the
tribunals
of
justice
and
gained
both
reputation
and
fortune
by
his
practice
phillis
had
been
flattered
and
indulged
from
her
earliest
childhood
and
like
many
literary
women
in
old
times
she
acquired
something
of
contempt
for
domestic
occupations
this
is
said
to
have
produced
unhappiness
between
her
and
her
husband
she
died
in
wilberforce
on
whom
may
the
blessing
of
god
rest
for
ever
aided
by
several
benevolent
individuals
established
a
seminary
for
colored
people
at
clapham
a
few
leagues
from
london
the
first
scholars
were
young
negroes
sent
by
the
governor
of
sierra
leone
the
abbé
grégoire
says
i
visited
this
establishment
in
to
examine
the
progress
of
the
scholars
and
i
found
there
existed
no
difference
between
them
and
european
children
except
that
of
color
the
same
observation
has
been
made
first
at
paris
in
the
ancient
college
of
la
marche
where
coesnon
professor
of
the
university
taught
a
number
of
colored
boys
many
members
of
the
national
institute
who
have
carefully
examined
this
college
and
watched
the
progress
of
the
scholars
in
their
particular
classes
and
public
exercises
will
testify
to
the
truth
of
my
assertion
correa
de
serra
the
learned
secretary
of
the
academy
at
portugal
informs
us
that
several
negroes
have
been
able
lawyers
preachers
and
professors
in
the
southern
states
the
small
black
children
are
proverbially
brighter
and
more
forward
than
white
ones
of
the
same
age
repartees
by
no
means
indicative
of
stupidity
have
sometimes
been
made
by
negroes
a
slave
was
suddenly
roused
with
the
exclamation
why
you
wake
when
your
master
calls
the
negro
answered
has
no
on
a
public
day
the
museum
in
boston
was
thronged
with
visiters
to
see
the
representation
of
the
salem
murder
some
colored
women
being
jostled
back
by
a
crowd
of
white
people
expostulated
thus
do
you
know
it
is
always
proper
to
let
the
walk
first
it
argues
some
degree
of
philosophy
to
be
able
to
indulge
wit
at
the
expense
of
what
is
most
unjustly
considered
a
degradation
public
prejudice
shamefully
fetters
these
people
and
it
has
been
wisely
said
if
we
can
not
our
chains
the
next
best
thing
we
can
do
is
to
with
them
ai
footnote
ai
in
a
beautiful
little
volume
called
mary
journey
by
francis
graeter
among
bonaparte
officers
there
was
a
mulatto
general
of
division
named
alexander
dumas
in
the
army
of
the
alps
with
charged
bayonet
he
ascended
bernard
defended
by
a
number
of
redoubts
took
possession
of
the
enemy
cannon
and
turned
their
own
ammunition
against
them
he
likewise
signalized
himself
in
the
expedition
to
egypt
his
troop
composed
of
blacks
and
mulattoes
were
everywhere
formidable
near
lisle
alexander
dumas
with
only
four
men
attacked
a
post
of
fifty
austrians
killed
six
and
made
sixteen
prisoners
napoleon
called
him
the
horatius
cocles
of
the
tyrols
on
his
return
from
egypt
dumas
unluckily
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
neapolitan
government
and
was
two
years
kept
in
irons
he
died
in
between
and
some
fugitive
negroes
united
with
some
brazilians
formed
two
free
states
in
south
america
called
the
great
and
little
palmares
so
named
on
account
of
the
abundance
of
palm
trees
the
great
palmares
was
nearly
destroyed
by
the
hollanders
in
but
at
the
close
of
the
war
the
slaves
in
the
neighborhood
of
fernanbouc
resolved
to
form
an
establishment
which
would
secure
their
freedom
like
the
old
romans
they
obtained
wives
by
making
incursions
upon
their
neighbors
and
carrying
off
the
women
they
formed
a
constitution
established
tribunals
of
justice
and
adopted
a
form
of
worship
similar
to
christianity
the
chiefs
chosen
for
life
were
elected
by
the
people
they
fortified
their
principal
towns
cultivated
their
gardens
and
fields
and
reared
domestic
animals
they
lived
in
prosperity
and
peace
until
when
the
portuguese
prepared
an
expedition
against
them
the
palmarisians
defended
themselves
with
desperate
valor
but
were
overcome
by
superior
numbers
some
rushed
upon
death
that
they
might
not
survive
their
liberty
others
were
sold
and
dispersed
by
the
conquerors
thus
ended
this
interesting
republic
had
it
continued
to
the
present
time
it
might
have
produced
a
very
material
change
in
the
character
and
condition
of
the
colored
race
in
the
seventeenth
century
when
jamaica
was
still
under
the
dominion
of
the
spaniards
a
party
of
slaves
under
the
command
of
john
de
bolas
regained
their
independence
they
increased
in
numbers
elected
the
famous
cudjoe
as
their
chief
and
became
very
formidable
cudjoe
established
a
confederation
among
all
the
maroon
tribes
and
by
his
bravery
and
skilful
management
compelled
the
english
to
make
a
treaty
in
which
they
acknowledged
the
freedom
of
the
blacks
and
ceded
to
them
for
ever
a
portion
of
the
territory
of
jamaica
the
french
national
assembly
admitted
free
colored
deputies
from
domingo
and
promised
a
perfect
equality
of
rights
without
regard
to
complexion
but
as
usual
the
white
colonists
made
every
possible
exertion
to
set
aside
the
claims
of
their
brethren
it
was
very
policy
for
the
planters
absolutely
needed
the
friendship
of
the
free
mulattoes
and
negroes
as
a
defence
against
the
slaves
oge
one
of
the
colored
deputies
an
energetic
and
shrewd
man
was
in
paris
watching
political
movements
with
intense
interest
resolved
to
maintain
the
rights
of
his
oppressed
companions
quietly
if
he
could
forcibly
if
he
must
day
after
day
a
hearing
was
promised
and
day
after
day
upon
some
idle
pretext
or
other
it
was
deferred
oge
became
exasperated
his
friends
in
france
recommended
the
only
medicine
ever
offered
by
the
white
man
to
the
african
patience
patience
but
he
had
long
observed
the
operation
of
slavery
and
he
knew
that
patience
whatever
it
might
do
for
the
white
man
brought
upon
the
negro
nothing
but
contempt
and
accumulated
wrong
discouraged
in
his
efforts
to
make
head
against
the
intrigues
of
the
slaveholders
he
could
not
contain
his
indignation
i
begin
said
he
to
clarkson
not
to
care
whether
the
national
assembly
will
hear
us
or
not
but
let
it
beware
of
the
consequences
we
will
no
longer
continue
to
be
held
in
a
degraded
light
despatches
shall
go
directly
to
domingo
and
we
will
soon
follow
them
we
can
produce
as
good
soldiers
on
our
own
estates
as
those
in
france
our
own
arms
shall
make
us
independent
and
respectable
if
we
are
forced
to
desperate
measures
it
will
be
in
vain
that
thousands
are
sent
across
the
atlantic
to
bring
us
back
to
our
former
state
the
french
government
issued
orders
to
prevent
the
embarkation
of
negroes
and
mulattoes
but
oge
by
the
way
of
england
contrived
to
return
to
domingo
on
his
arrival
he
demanded
the
execution
of
decrees
made
in
favor
of
his
brethren
but
either
resisted
or
evaded
by
their
white
oppressors
his
plea
founded
in
justice
and
sanctioned
by
divine
authority
was
rejected
the
parties
became
exasperated
and
an
attack
ensued
the
spanish
government
basely
and
wickedly
delivered
oge
to
his
enemies
he
asked
for
a
defender
to
plead
his
cause
but
he
asked
in
vain
thirteen
of
his
companions
were
condemned
to
the
galleys
more
than
twenty
to
the
gibbet
and
oge
and
chavanne
were
tortured
on
the
wheel
where
rests
the
guilt
in
this
case
let
those
blame
oge
who
can
my
heart
and
conscience
both
refuse
to
do
it
the
celebrated
black
chieftain
was
born
a
slave
in
the
year
upon
the
plantation
of
count
de
noé
his
amiable
deportment
as
a
slave
the
patience
mildness
and
benevolence
of
his
disposition
and
the
purity
of
his
conduct
amid
the
general
laxity
of
morals
which
prevailed
in
the
island
gained
for
him
many
of
those
advantages
which
afterwards
gave
him
such
absolute
ascendency
over
his
insurgent
brethren
his
good
qualities
attracted
the
attention
of
bayou
de
libertas
the
agent
on
the
estate
who
taught
him
reading
writing
and
arithmetic
elements
of
knowledge
which
hardly
one
in
ten
thousand
of
his
possessed
bayou
made
him
his
postillion
which
gave
him
advantages
much
above
those
of
the
field
slaves
when
the
general
rising
of
the
blacks
took
place
in
much
solicitation
was
used
to
induce
toussaint
to
join
them
but
he
declined
until
he
had
procured
an
opportunity
for
the
escape
of
bayou
and
his
family
to
baltimore
shipping
a
considerable
quantity
of
sugar
for
the
supply
of
their
immediate
wants
in
his
subsequent
prosperity
he
availed
himself
of
every
occasion
to
give
them
new
marks
of
his
gratitude
having
thus
provided
security
for
his
benefactor
he
joined
a
corps
of
blacks
under
the
orders
of
general
biassou
but
was
soon
raised
to
the
principal
command
biassou
being
degraded
on
account
of
his
cruelty
and
ferocity
indeed
toussaint
was
every
way
so
much
superior
to
the
other
negroes
by
reason
of
his
general
intelligence
and
education
his
prudence
activity
and
address
not
less
than
his
bravery
that
he
immediately
attained
a
complete
ascendency
over
all
the
black
chieftains
in
toussaint
received
from
the
french
government
a
commission
of
of
the
armies
of
domingo
and
as
such
signed
the
convention
with
general
maitland
for
the
evacuation
of
the
island
by
the
british
from
until
the
island
continued
tranquil
under
the
government
of
toussaint
who
adopted
and
enforced
the
most
judicious
measures
for
healing
the
wounds
of
his
country
and
restoring
its
commercial
and
agricultural
prosperity
his
efforts
would
have
been
attended
with
much
success
but
for
the
expedition
which
bonaparte
sent
against
the
island
under
the
command
of
le
clerc
this
expedition
fruitless
as
it
was
in
respect
of
its
general
object
proved
fatal
to
the
negro
chieftain
toussaint
was
noted
for
private
virtues
among
the
rest
warm
affection
for
his
family
le
clerc
brought
out
from
france
toussaint
two
sons
with
their
preceptor
whose
orders
were
to
carry
his
pupils
to
their
father
and
make
use
of
them
to
work
on
his
tenderness
and
induce
him
to
abandon
his
countrymen
if
he
yielded
he
was
to
be
made
second
in
command
to
le
clerc
if
he
refused
his
children
were
to
be
reserved
as
hostages
of
his
fidelity
to
the
french
notwithstanding
the
greatness
of
the
sacrifice
demanded
of
him
toussaint
remained
faithful
to
his
brethren
we
pass
over
the
details
of
the
war
which
at
length
ended
in
a
treaty
of
peace
concluded
by
toussaint
dessalines
and
christophe
against
their
better
judgment
but
in
consequence
of
the
effect
of
le
clerc
professions
upon
their
simple
followers
who
were
induced
to
lay
down
their
arms
toussaint
retired
to
his
plantation
relying
upon
the
solemn
assurances
of
le
clerc
that
his
person
and
property
should
be
held
sacred
notwithstanding
these
assurances
he
was
treacherously
seized
in
the
night
hurried
on
board
a
ship
of
war
and
conveyed
to
brest
he
was
conducted
first
to
close
prison
in
chateaux
de
joux
and
from
thence
to
besançon
where
he
was
plunged
into
a
cold
wet
subterranean
prison
which
soon
proved
fatal
to
a
constitution
used
only
to
the
warm
skies
and
free
air
of
the
west
indies
he
languished
through
the
winter
of
and
his
death
which
happened
in
april
raised
a
cry
of
indignation
against
the
government
which
had
chosen
this
dastardly
method
of
destroying
one
of
the
best
and
bravest
of
the
negro
race
toussaint
is
thus
spoken
of
by
vincent
in
his
reflections
on
the
state
of
domingo
toussaint
is
the
most
active
and
indefatigable
man
of
whom
it
is
possible
to
form
an
idea
he
is
always
present
wherever
difficulty
or
danger
makes
his
presence
necessary
his
great
sobriety
the
power
of
living
without
repose
the
facility
with
which
he
resumes
the
affairs
of
the
cabinet
after
the
most
tiresome
excursions
of
answering
daily
a
hundred
letters
and
of
habitually
tiring
five
secretaries
render
him
so
superior
to
all
around
him
that
their
respect
and
submission
almost
amount
to
fanaticism
it
is
certain
no
man
in
modern
times
has
obtained
such
an
influence
over
a
mass
of
ignorant
people
as
general
toussaint
possesses
over
his
brethren
of
domingo
he
is
endowed
with
a
prodigious
memory
he
is
a
good
father
and
a
good
husband
toussaint
religious

on
account
of
his
zeal
in
this
respect

class
of
men
called
him
in
derision
the
capuchin
with
the
genius
and
energy
of
bonaparte
general
toussaint
is
said
to
have
possessed
the
same
political
duplicity
and
cunning
these
are
qualities
which
almost
inevitably
grew
out
of
the
peculiar
circumstances
in
which
they
were
placed
and
the
obstacles
with
which
they
were
obliged
to
contend
wordsworth
addressed
the
following
sonnet
to
toussaint
toussaint
thou
most
unhappy
man
of

whether
the
whistling
rustic
tends
his
plough
within
thy
hearing
or
thou
liest
now
buried
in
some
deep

oh
miserable
chieftain
where
and
when
wilt
thou
find
patience
yet
die
not
do
thou
wear
rather
in
thy
bonds
a
cheerful
brow
though
fallen

never

rise
again
live
and

comfort
thou
hast
left
behind
powers
that
will
work
for
thee

and

there
not
a
breathing
of
the
common
wind
that
will
forget
thee
thou
hast

thy
friends
are
exultations
agonies

godwin
in
his
admirable
lectures
on
colonial
slavery
says
can
the
west
india
islands
since
their
first
discovery
by
columbus
boast
a
single
name
which
deserves
comparison
with
that
of
toussaint
if
we
are
willing
to
see
and
believe
we
have
full
opportunity
to
convince
ourselves
that
the
colored
population
are
highly
susceptible
of
cultivation
domingo
produces
black
legislators
scholars
and
gentlemen
the
very
negroes
who
had
been
slaves
formed
a
constitution
that
would
do
credit
to
statesmen
americans
may
well
blush
at
its
republicanism
the
enemies
of
true
freedom
were
very
ready
to
predict
that
the
government
of
hayti
could
not
continue
for
any
length
of
time
but
it
has
now
lasted
nearly
thirty
years
constantly
increasing
in
respectability
and
wealth
the
affairs
of
greece
have
been
managed
with
much
less
ability
and
discretion
though
all
the
cabinets
of
europe
have
given
assistance
and
advice
domingo
achieved
her
independence
alone
and
unaided
nay
in
the
very
teeth
of
prejudice
and
scorn
the
greeks
had
loans
from
england
and
contributions
from
america
and
sympathy
from
half
the
world
the
decisive
battle
of
navarino
was
gained
by
the
combined
fleets
of
england
france
and
russia
is
it
asked
why
hayti
has
not
produced
any
examples
of
splendid
genius
in
reply
let
me
inquire
how
long
did
the
europeans
ridicule
for
our
poverty
in
literature
when
raynal
reproached
the
united
states
with
not
having
produced
one
celebrated
man
jefferson
requested
him
to
wait
until
we
had
existed
as
long
as
the
greeks
before
they
had
a
homer
the
romans
a
virgil
and
the
french
a
racine
half
a
century
elapsed
before
our
republic
produced
irving
cooper
sedgwick
halleck
and
bryant
we
must
not
forget
that
the
cruel
prejudice
under
which
colored
people
labor
makes
it
extremely
difficult
for
them
to
gain
admission
to
the
best
colleges
and
schools
they
are
obliged
to
contend
with
obstacles
which
white
men
never
encounter
it
might
seem
wonderful
that
the
descendants
of
wise
ethiopia
and
learned
egypt
are
now
in
such
a
state
of
degradation
if
history
did
not
furnish
a
remarkable
parallel
in
the
condition
of
the
modern
greeks
the
land
of
homer
pericles
and
plato
is
now
inhabited
by
ignorant
brutal
pirates
freedom
made
the
grecians
great
and
glorious
tyranny
has
made
them
stupid
and
miserable
yet
their
yoke
has
been
light
compared
with
african
bondage
in
both
cases
the
wrongs
of
the
oppressed
have
been
converted
into
an
argument
against
them
we
first
debase
the
nature
of
man
by
making
him
a
slave
and
then
very
coolly
tell
him
that
he
must
always
remain
a
slave
because
he
does
not
know
how
to
use
freedom
we
first
crush
people
to
the
earth
and
then
claim
the
right
of
trampling
on
them
for
ever
because
they
are
prostrate
truly
human
selfishness
never
invented
a
rule
which
worked
so
charmingly
both
ways
no
one
thinks
of
doubting
the
intellect
of
indians
yet
civilization
has
certainly
advanced
much
farther
in
the
interior
of
africa
than
it
did
among
the
north
american
tribes
the
indians
have
strong
untutored
eloquence
so
have
the
africans
and
where
will
you
find
an
indian
chieftain
whose
pride
intellect
and
valor
are
more
than
a
match
for
zhinga
both
of
these
classes
have
been
most
shamefully
wronged
but
public
prejudice
which
bows
the
negro
to
the
earth
has
borne
with
a
far
less
crushing
power
upon
the
energies
of
the
red
man
yet
they
have
not
produced
a
shakspeare
or
a
newton
but
i
shall
be
asked
how
it
is
that
the
nations
of
africa
having
proceeded
so
far
in
the
arts
of
civilization
have
made
a
full
stop
and
remained
century
after
century
without
any
obvious
improvement
i
will
answer
this
by
another
question
how
long
did
the
ancient
helvetians
gauls
and
saxons
remain
in
such
a
state
of
barbarism
that
what
they
considered
splendor
and
refinement
would
be
called
poverty
and
rudeness
by
their
german
french
and
english
descendants
what
was
it
that
changed
the
intellectual
and
moral
character
of
these
people
after
ages
of
ignorance
and
ferocity
it
was
the
of
but
alas
with
the
introduction
of
printing
modern
slavery
was
introduced
while
commerce
has
carried
books
and
maps
to
other
portions
of
the
globe
she
has
sent
kidnappers
with
guns
and
cutlasses
into
africa
we
have
not
preached
the
gospel
of
peace
to
her
princes
we
have
incited
them
to
make
war
upon
each
other
to
fill
our
markets
with
slaves
while
knowledge
like
a
mighty
pillar
of
fire
has
guided
the
european
nations
still
onward
and
onward
a
dark
cloud
has
settled
more
and
more
gloomily
over
benighted
africa
the
lessons
of
time
the
experience
of
ages
from
which
we
have
learned
so
much
are
entirely
lost
to
this
vast
continent
i
have
heard
it
asserted
that
the
indians
were
evidently
superior
to
the
negroes
because
it
was
impossible
to
enslave
our
slave
laws
prove
that
there
are
some
exceptions
to
this
remark
and
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
indians
have
been
fairly
met
in
battle
contending
with
but
one
nation
at
a
time
while
the
whole
world
have
combined
against
the
africans
sending
emissaries
to
lurk
for
them
in
secret
places
or
steal
them
at
midnight
from
their
homes
the
indian
will
seek
freedom
in
the
arms
of
death
and
so
will
the
negro
by
thousands
and
thousands
these
poor
people
have
died
for
freedom
they
have
stabbed
themselves
for
freedom
jumped
into
the
waves
for
freedom
starved
for
freedom
fought
like
very
tigers
for
freedom
but
they
have
been
hung
and
burned
and
shot
and
their
tyrants
have
been
their
historians
when
the
africans
have
writers
of
their
own
we
shall
hear
their
efforts
for
liberty
called
by
the
true
title
of
heroism
in
a
glorious
cause
we
are
told
in
the
fable
that
a
lion
looking
at
the
picture
of
one
of
his
own
species
conquered
and
trampled
on
by
man
calmly
said
we
lions
have
no
painters
i
shall
be
told
that
in
the
preceding
examples
i
have
shown
only
the
bright
side
of
the
picture
i
readily
grant
it
but
i
have
deemed
it
important
to
show
that
the
picture
a
bright
side
i
am
well
aware
that
most
of
the
negro
authors
are
remarkable
principally
because
they
are
negroes
with
considerable
talent
they
generally
evince
bad
taste
i
do
not
pretend
that
they
are
scotts
or
miltons
but
i
wish
to
prove
that
they
are
capable
of
producing
their
proportion
of
scotts
and
miltons
if
they
could
be
allowed
to
live
in
a
state
of
physical
and
intellectual
freedom
but
where
at
the
present
time
they
live
in
perfect
freedom
cheered
by
the
hopes
and
excited
by
the
rewards
which
stimulate
white
men
to
exertion
every
avenue
to
distinction
is
closed
to
them
even
where
the
body
is
suffered
to
be
free
a
hateful
prejudice
keeps
the
soul
in
fetters
i
think
every
candid
mind
must
admit
that
it
is
more
wonderful
they
have
done
so
much
than
that
they
have
done
no
more
as
a
class
i
am
aware
that
the
negroes
with
many
honorable
exceptions
are
ignorant
and
show
little
disposition
to
be
otherwise
but
this
ceases
to
be
the
case
just
in
proportion
as
they
are
free
the
fault
is
in
their
unnatural
situation
not
in
themselves
tyranny
always
dwarfs
the
intellect
homer
tells
us
that
when
jupiter
condemns
a
man
to
slavery
he
takes
from
him
half
his
mind
a
family
of
children
treated
with
habitual
violence
or
contempt
become
stupid
and
sluggish
and
are
called
fools
by
the
very
parents
or
guardians
who
have
crushed
their
mental
energies
it
was
remarked
by
dupuis
the
british
consul
at
mogadore
that
the
generality
of
europeans
after
a
long
captivity
and
severe
treatment
among
the
arabs
seemed
at
first
exceedingly
dull
and
insensible
if
they
had
been
any
considerable
time
in
slavery
says
he
they
appeared
lost
to
reason
and
feeling
their
spirits
broken
and
their
faculties
sunk
in
a
species
of
stupor
which
i
am
unable
adequately
to
describe
they
appeared
degraded
even
below
the
negro
slave
the
succession
of
hardships
without
any
protecting
law
to
which
they
can
appeal
for
alleviation
or
redress
seems
to
destroy
every
spring
of
exertion
or
hope
in
their
minds
they
appear
indifferent
to
every
thing
around
them
abject
servile
and
brutish
lieutenant
hall
in
his
travels
in
the
united
states
makes
the
following
just
remark
cut
off
hope
for
the
future
and
freedom
for
the
present
superadd
a
due
pressure
of
bodily
suffering
and
personal
degradation
and
you
have
a
slave
who
of
whatever
zone
nation
or
complexion
will
be
what
the
poor
african
is
torpid
debased
and
lowered
beneath
the
standard
of
humanity
the
great
virginian
patrick
henry
who
certainly
had
a
fair
chance
to
observe
the
effects
of
slavery
says
if
a
man
be
in
chains
he
droops
and
bows
to
the
earth
because
his
spirits
are
broken
but
let
him
twist
the
fetters
off
his
legs
and
he
will
stand
erect
the
following
is
the
testimony
of
the
rev
walsh
on
the
same
subject
he
is
describing
his
first
arrival
at
rio
janeiro
the
whole
labor
of
bearing
and
moving
burdens
is
performed
by
these
people
and
the
state
in
which
they
appear
is
revolting
to
humanity
here
were
a
number
of
beings
entirely
naked
with
the
exception
of
a
covering
of
dirty
rags
tied
about
their
waists
their
skins
from
constant
exposure
to
the
weather
had
become
hard
crusty
and
seamed
resembling
the
coarse
black
covering
of
some
beast
or
like
that
of
an
elephant
a
wrinkled
hide
scattered
with
scanty
hairs
on
contemplating
their
persons
you
saw
them
with
a
physical
organization
resembling
beings
of
a
grade
below
the
rank
of
man
long
projecting
heels
the
gastronymic
muscle
wanting
and
no
calves
to
their
legs
their
mouths
and
chins
protruded
their
noses
flat
their
foreheads
retiring
having
exactly
the
head
and
legs
of
the
baboon
tribe
some
of
these
beings
were
yoked
to
drays
on
which
they
dragged
heavy
burdens
some
were
chained
by
the
neck
and
legs
and
moved
with
loads
thus
encumbered
some
followed
each
other
in
ranks
with
heavy
weights
on
their
heads
chattering
in
the
most
inarticulate
and
dismal
cadence
as
they
moved
along
some
were
munching
young
like
beasts
of
burden
eating
green
provender
and
some
were
seen
near
the
water
lying
on
the
bare
ground
among
filth
and
offal
coiled
up
like
dogs
and
seeming
to
expect
or
require
no
more
comfort
or
accommodation
exhibiting
a
state
and
conformation
so
unhuman
that
they
not
only
seemed
but
actually
were
far
below
the
inferior
animals
around
them
horses
and
mules
were
not
employed
in
this
way
they
were
used
only
for
pleasure
and
not
labor
they
were
seen
in
the
same
streets
pampered
spirited
and
richly
caparisoned
enjoying
a
state
far
superior
to
the
negroes
and
appearing
to
look
down
on
the
fettered
and
burdened
wretches
they
were
passing
as
on
beings
of
an
inferior
rank
in
the
creation
some
of
the
negroes
actually
seemed
to
envy
the
caparisons
of
their
and
eyed
with
jealousy
their
glittering
harness
in
imitation
of
this
finery
they
were
fond
of
thrums
of
threads
and
i
saw
one
creature
who
supported
the
squalid
rag
that
wrapped
his
waist
by
a
suspender
of
gaudy
worsted
which
he
turned
every
moment
to
look
at
on
his
naked
shoulder
the
greater
number
however
were
as
unconscious
of
any
covering
for
use
or
ornament
as
a
pig
or
an
ass
the
first
impression
of
all
this
on
my
mind
was
to
shake
the
conviction
i
had
always
felt
of
the
wrong
and
hardship
inflicted
on
our
black
and
that
they
were
only
in
that
state
which
god
and
nature
had
assigned
them
that
they
were
the
lowest
grade
of
human
existence
and
the
link
that
connected
it
with
the
brute
and
that
the
gradation
was
so
insensible
and
their
natures
so
intermingled
that
it
was
impossible
to
tell
where
one
had
terminated
and
the
other
commenced
and
that
it
was
not
surprising
that
people
who
contemplated
them
every
day
so
formed
so
employed
and
so
degraded
should
forget
their
claims
to
that
rank
in
the
scale
of
being
in
which
modern
philanthropists
are
so
anxious
to
place
them
i
did
not
at
the
moment
myself
recollect
that
the
white
man
made
a
slave
on
the
coast
of
africa
suffers
not
only
a
similar
mental
but
physical
deterioration
from
hardships
and
emaciation
and
becomes
in
time
the
dull
and
deformed
beast
i
now
saw
yoked
to
a
burden
a
few
hours
only
were
necessary
to
correct
my
first
impressions
of
the
negro
population
by
seeing
them
under
a
different
aspect
we
were
attracted
by
the
sound
of
military
music
and
found
it
proceeded
from
a
regiment
drawn
up
in
one
of
the
streets
their
colonel
had
just
died
and
they
attended
to
form
a
procession
to
celebrate
his
obsequies
they
were
all
of
different
shades
of
black
but
the
majority
were
negroes
their
equipment
was
excellent
they
wore
dark
jackets
white
pantaloons
and
black
leather
caps
and
belts
all
which
with
their
arms
were
in
high
order
their
band
produced
sweet
and
agreeable
music
of
the
leader
own
composition
and
the
men
went
through
some
evolutions
with
regularity
and
dexterity
they
were
only
a
militia
regiment
yet
were
as
well
appointed
and
disciplined
as
one
of
our
regiments
of
the
line
here
then
was
the
first
step
in
that
gradation
by
which
the
black
population
of
this
country
ascend
in
the
scale
of
humanity
he
advances
from
the
state
below
that
of
a
beast
of
burden
into
a
military
rank
and
he
shows
himself
as
capable
of
discipline
and
improvement
as
a
human
being
of
any
other
color
our
attention
was
next
attracted
by
negro
men
and
women
bearing
about
a
variety
of
articles
for
sale
some
in
baskets
some
on
boards
and
cases
carried
on
their
heads
they
belonged
to
a
class
of
small
shopkeepers
many
of
whom
vend
their
wares
at
home
but
the
greater
number
send
them
about
in
this
way
as
in
itinerant
shops
a
few
of
these
people
were
still
in
a
state
of
bondage
and
brought
a
certain
sum
every
evening
to
their
owners
as
the
produce
of
their
daily
labor
but
a
large
proportion
i
was
informed
were
free
and
exercised
this
little
calling
on
their
own
account
they
were
all
very
neat
and
clean
in
their
persons
and
had
a
decorum
and
sense
of
respectability
about
them
superior
to
whites
of
the
same
class
and
calling
all
their
articles
were
good
in
their
kind
and
neatly
kept
and
they
sold
them
with
simplicity
and
confidence
neither
wishing
to
take
advantage
of
others
nor
suspecting
that
it
would
be
taken
of
themselves
i
bought
some
confectionary
from
one
of
the
females
and
i
was
struck
with
the
modesty
and
propriety
of
her
manner
she
was
a
young
mother
and
had
with
her
a
child
of
which
she
seemed
very
fond
i
gave
it
a
little
comfit
and
it
turned
up
its
dusky
countenance
to
her
and
then
to
me
taking
my
sweetmeat
and
at
the
same
time
kissing
my
hand
as
yet
unacquainted
with
the
coin
of
the
country
i
had
none
that
was
current
about
me
and
was
leaving
the
articles
but
the
poor
young
woman
pressed
them
on
me
with
a
ready
confidence
repeating
in
broken
portuguese
i
am
sorry
to
say
the
time
never
came
for
i
could
not
recognise
her
person
afterwards
to
discharge
her
little
debt
though
i
went
to
the
same
place
for
the
purpose
it
soon
began
to
grow
dark
and
i
was
attracted
by
a
number
of
persons
bearing
large
lighted
wax
tapers
like
torches
gathering
before
a
house
as
i
passed
by
one
was
put
into
my
hand
by
a
man
who
seemed
in
some
authority
and
i
was
requested
to
fall
into
a
procession
that
was
forming
it
was
the
preparation
for
a
funeral
and
on
such
occasions
i
learned
that
they
always
request
the
attendance
of
a
passing
stranger
and
feel
hurt
if
they
are
refused
i
joined
the
party
and
proceeded
with
them
to
a
neighboring
church
when
we
entered
we
ranged
ourselves
on
each
side
of
a
platform
which
stood
near
the
choir
on
which
was
laid
an
open
coffin
covered
with
pink
silk
and
gold
borders
the
funeral
service
was
chanted
by
a
choir
of
priests
one
of
whom
was
a
negro
a
large
comely
man
whose
visage
formed
a
strong
and
striking
contrast
to
his
white
vestments
he
seemed
to
perform
his
part
with
a
decorum
and
sense
of
solemnity
which
i
did
not
observe
in
his
brethren
after
scattering
flowers
on
the
coffin
and
fumigating
it
with
incense
they
retired
the
procession
dispersed
and
we
returned
on
board
i
had
been
but
a
few
hours
on
shore
for
the
first
time
and
i
saw
an
african
negro
under
four
aspects
of
society
and
it
appeared
to
me
that
in
every
one
his
character
depended
on
the
state
in
which
he
was
placed
and
the
estimation
in
which
he
was
held
as
a
despised
slave
he
was
far
lower
than
other
animals
of
burden
that
surrounded
him
more
miserable
in
his
look
more
revolting
in
his
nakedness
more
distorted
in
his
person
and
apparently
more
deficient
in
intellect
than
the
horses
and
mules
that
passed
him
by
advanced
to
the
grade
of
a
soldier
he
was
clean
and
neat
in
his
person
amenable
to
discipline
expert
at
his
exercises
and
showed
the
port
and
bearing
of
a
white
man
similarly
placed
as
a
citizen
he
was
remarkable
for
the
respectability
of
his
appearance
and
the
decorum
of
his
manners
in
the
rank
assigned
him
and
as
a
priest
standing
in
the
house
of
god
appointed
to
instruct
society
on
their
most
important
interests
and
in
a
grade
in
which
moral
and
intellectual
fitness
is
required
and
a
certain
degree
of
superiority
is
expected
he
seemed
even
more
devout
in
his
impressions
and
more
correct
in
his
manners
than
his
white
associates
i
came
therefore
to
the
irresistible
conclusion
in
my
mind
that
color
was
an
accident
affecting
the
surface
of
a
man
and
having
no
more
to
do
with
his
qualities
than
his
clothes
that
god
had
equally
created
an
african
in
the
image
of
his
person
and
equally
given
him
an
immortal
soul
and
that
a
european
had
no
pretext
but
his
own
cupidity
for
impiously
thrusting
his
from
that
rank
in
the
creation
which
the
almighty
had
assigned
him
and
degrading
him
below
the
lot
of
the
brute
beasts
that
perish
the
honorable
everett

work
on
the
political
situation
of
america
says
nations
and
races
like
individuals
have
their
day
and
seldom
have
a
second
the
blacks
had
a
long
and
glorious
one
and
after
what
they
have
been
and
done
it
argues
not
so
much
a
mistaken
theory
as
sheer
ignorance
of
the
most
notorious
historical
facts
to
pretend
that
they
are
naturally
inferior
to
the
whites
it
would
seem
indeed
that
if
any
race
have
a
right
claim
to
a
sort
of
over
others
on
the
fair
and
honorable
ground
of
talents
displayed
and
benefits
conferred
it
is
precisely
this
very
one
which
we
take
upon
us
in
the
pride
of
a
temporary
superiority
to
stamp
with
the
brand
of
essential
degradation
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
add
that
while
the
blacks
were
the
leading
race
in
civilization
and
political
power
there
was
no
prejudice
among
the
whites
against
their
color
on
the
contrary
we
find
that
the
early
greeks
regarded
them
as
a
superior
variety
of
the
human
species
not
only
in
intellectual
and
moral
qualities
but
in
outward
appearance
ethiopians
says
herodotus
all
other
men
in
longevity
stature
and
personal
beauty
then
let
the
slaveholder
no
longer
apologize
for
himself
by
urging
the
stupidity
and
sensuality
of
negroes
it
is
upon
the
which
thus
transforms
men
into
beasts
that
the
reproach
rests
in
all
its
strength
and
bitterness
and
even
if
the
negroes
were
beyond
all
doubt
our
inferiors
in
intellect
this
would
form
no
excuse
for
oppression
or
contempt
the
use
of
law
and
public
opinion
is
to
protect
the
weak
against
the
strong
and
the
government
which
perverts
these
blessings
into
means
of
tyranny
resembles

is
there

american
willing
that
the

and

should
bear
despotic

deportment
of

heartily
wished

had
better

the
following
is
an
account
of
his
arrival
at
jumbo
in
company
with
a
native
of
that
place
who
had
been
absent
several
years
the
meeting
between
the

was
very
tender

display
their

in

expressive
manner
amidst
these
transports
the
aged

was
led
forth
leaning
upon
a
staff
every
one
made
way
for
her
and
she
stretched
out
her
hand
to
bid
her
son
welcome
being
totally
blind
she
stroked
his
hands
arms
and
face
with
great
care
and
seemed
highly
delighted
that
her
latter
days
were
blessed
by
his
return
and
that
her
ears
once
more
heard
the
music
of
his
voice
from
this
interview
i
was
fully
convinced
that
whatever
difference
there
is
between
the
negro
and
the
european
in
the
conformation
of
the
nose
and
the
color
of
the
skin
there
is
none
in
the
genuine
sympathies
and
characteristic
feelings
of
our
common
nature
at
a
small
town
in
the
interior
called
wawra
he
says
in
the
course
of
the
day
several
women
hearing
that
i
was
going
to
sego
came
and
begged
me
to
inquire
of
mansong
the
king
what
was
become
of
their
children
one
woman
in
particular
told
me
that
her
son
name
was
mamadee
that
he
was
no
heathen
but
prayed
to
god
morning
and
evening
that
he
had
been
taken
from
her
about
three
years
ago
by
mansong
army
since
which
she
had
never
heard
from
him
she
said
she
often
dreamed
about
him
and
begged
me
if
i
should
see
him
in
bambarra
or
in
my
own
country
to
tell
him
that
his
mother
and
sister
were
still
alive
at
sego
in
bambarra
the
king
being
jealous
of
park
intentions
forbade
him
to
cross
the
river
under
these
discouraging
circumstances
he
was
advised
to
lodge
at
a
distant
village
but
there
the
same
distrust
of
the
white
man
purposes
prevailed
and
no
person
would
allow
him
to
enter
his
house
he
says
i
was
regarded
with
astonishment
and
fear
and
was
obliged
to
sit
all
day
without
food
under
the
shade
of
a
tree
the
wind
rose
and
there
was
great
appearance
of
a
heavy
rain
and
the
wild
beasts
are
so
very
numerous
in
the
neighborhood
that
i
should
have
been
under
the
necessity
of
resting
among
the
branches
of
the
tree
about
sunset
however
as
i
was
preparing
to
pass
the
night
in
this
manner
and
had
turned
my
horse
loose
that
he
might
graze
at
liberty
a
woman
returning
from
the
labors
of
the
field
stopped
to
observe
me
perceiving
that
i
was
weary
and
dejected
she
inquired
into
my
situation
which
i
briefly
explained
to
her
whereupon
with
looks
of
great
compassion
she
took
up
my
saddle
and
bridle
and
told
me
to
follow
her
having
conducted
me
into
her
hut
she
lighted
a
lamp
spread
a
mat
on
the
floor
and
told
me
i
might
remain
there
for
the
night
finding
that
i
was
hungry
she
went
out
and
soon
returned
with
a
very
fine
fish
which
being
broiled
upon
some
embers
she
gave
me
for
supper
the
women
then
resumed
their
task
of
spinning
cotton
and
lightened
their
labor
with
songs
one
of
which
must
have
been
composed
extempore
for
i
was
myself
the
subject
of
it
it
was
sung
by
one
of
the
young
women
the
rest
joining
in
a
kind
of
chorus
the
air
was
sweet
and
plaintive
and
the
words
literally
translated
were

the
winds
roar

the
rains
fell

poor

the

can
fully
sympathize
with
this
intelligent
and
traveller
when
he
observes
trifling
as
this
recital
may
appear
the
circumstance
was
highly
affecting
to
a
person
in
my
situation
i
was
oppressed
with
such
unexpected
kindness
and
sleep
fled
from
my
eyes
in
the
morning

my

landlady
with
two
of

four
brass
buttons
remaining
on

waistcoat

only
recompense
i
could
make
her
the
duchess
of
devonshire
whose
beauty
and
talent
gained
such
extensive
celebrity
was
so
much
pleased
with
this
african
song
and
the
kind
feelings
in
which
it
originated
that
she
put
it
into
english
verse

employed

eminent

park
thus
continues
his
narrative
a
little
before
sunset
i
descended
on
the
northwest
side
of
a
ridge
of
hills
and
as
i
was
looking
about
for
a
convenient
tree
under
which
to
pass
the
night
for
i
had
no
hopes
of
reaching
any
town
i
descended
into
a
delightful
valley
and
soon
afterward
arrived
at
a
romantic
village
called
kooma
i
was
immediately
surrounded
by
a
circle
of
the
harmless
villagers
they
asked
me
a
thousand
questions
about
my
country
and
in
return
for
my
information
brought
corn
and
milk
for
myself
and
grass
for
my
horse
kindled
a
fire
in
the
hut
where
i
was
to
sleep
and
appeared
very
anxious
to
serve
me
afterward
being
robbed
and
stripped
by
a
banditti
in
the
wilderness
he
informs
us
that
the
robbers
stood
considering
whether
they
should
leave
him
quite
destitute
even
in
minds
humanity
partially
prevailed
over
avarice
they
returned
the
worst
of
two
shirts
and
a
pair
of
trowsers
and
as
they
went
away
one
of
them
threw
back
his
hat
at
the
next
village
park
entered
a
complaint
to
the
dooty
or
chief
man
who
continued
very
calmly
smoking
while
he
listened
to
the
narration
but
when
he
had
heard
all
the
particulars
he
took
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
tossing
up
the
sleeve
of
his
cloak
with
an
indignant
air
he
said
you
shall
have
every
thing
restored
to
you
i
have
sworn
it
then
turning
to
an
attendant
he
added
give
the
white
man
a
draught
of
water
and
with
the
first
light
of
morning
go
over
the
hills
and
inform
the
dooty
of
bammakoo
that
a
poor
white
man
the
king
of
bambarra
stranger
has
been
robbed
by
the
king
of
foolodoo
people
he
then
invited
the
traveller
to
remain
with
him
and
share
his
provisions
until
the
messenger
returned
park
accepted
the
kind
offer
most
gratefully
and
in
a
few
days
his
horse
and
clothes
were
restored
to
him
at
the
village
of
nemacoo
where
corn
was
so
scarce
that
the
people
were
actually
in
a
state
of
starvation
a
negro
pitied
his
distress
and
brought
him
food
at
kamalia
park
was
earnestly
dissuaded
by
an
african
named
karfa
from
attempting
to
cross
the
jalonka
wilderness
during
the
rainy
season
to
which
he
replied
that
there
was
no
alternative
for
he
was
so
poor
that
he
must
either
beg
his
subsistence
from
place
to
place
or
perish
with
hunger
karfa
eagerly
inquired
if
he
could
eat
the
food
of
the
country
adding
that
if
he
would
stay
with
him
he
should
have
plenty
of
victuals
and
a
hut
to
sleep
in
and
that
after
he
had
been
safely
conducted
to
the
gambia
he
might
make
what
return
he
thought
proper
he
was
accordingly
provided
with
a
mat
to
sleep
on
an
earthern
jar
for
holding
water
a
small
calabash
for
a
drinking
cup
and
two
meals
a
day
with
a
supply
of
wood
and
water
from
karfa
own
dwelling
here
he
recovered
from
a
fever
which
had
tormented
him
several
weeks
his
benevolent
landlord
came
daily
to
inquire
after
his
health
and
see
that
he
had
every
thing
for
his
comfort
park
assures
us
that
the
simple
and
affectionate
manner
of
those
around
him
contributed
not
a
little
to
his
recovery
he
adds
thus
was
i
delivered
by
the
friendly
care
of
this
benevolent
negro
from
a
situation
truly
deplorable
distress
and
famine
pressed
hard
upon
me
i
had
before
me
the
gloomy
wilderness
of
jallonkadoo
where
the
traveller
sees
no
habitation
for
five
successive
days
i
had
observed
at
a
distance
the
rapid
course
of
the
river
kokaro
and
had
almost
marked
out
the
place
where
i
thought
i
was
doomed
to
perish
when
this
friendly
negro
stretched
out
his
hospitable
hand
for
my
relief
park
having
travelled
in
company
with
a
coffle
of
slaves
thus
describes
his
feelings
as
they
came
near
the
coast
although
i
was
now
approaching
the
end
of
my
tedious
and
toilsome
journey
and
expected
in
another
day
to
meet
with
countrymen
and
friends
i
could
not
part
with
my
unfortunate
doomed
as
i
knew
most
of
them
to
be
to
a
life
of
slavery
in
a
foreign
land
without
great
emotion
during
a
peregrination
of
more
than
five
hundred
miles
exposed
to
the
burning
rays
of
a
tropical
sun
these
poor
slaves
amidst
their
own
infinitely
greater
sufferings
would
commiserate
mine
and
frequently
of
their
own
accord
bring
water
to
quench
my
thirst
and
at
night
collect
branches
and
leaves
to
prepare
me
a
bed
in
the
wilderness
we
parted
with
mutual
regret
and
blessings
my
good
wishes
and
prayers
were
all
i
could
bestow
upon
them
and
it
afforded
me
some
consolation
to
be
told
that
they
were
sensible
i
had
no
more
to
give
the
same
enlightened
traveller
remarks
all
the
negro
nations
that
fell
under
my
observation
though
divided
into
a
number
of
petty
independent
states
subsist
chiefly
by
the
same
means
live
nearly
in
the
same
temperature
and
possess
a
wonderful
similarity
of
disposition
the
mandingoes
in
particular
are
a
very
gentle
race
cheerful
inquisitive
credulous
simple
and
fond
of
flattery
perhaps
the
most
prominent
defect
in
their
character
was
that
insurmountable
propensity
which
the
reader
must
have
observed
to
prevail
in
all
classes
to
steal
from
me
the
few
effects
i
was
possessed
of
no
complete
justification
can
be
offered
for
this
conduct
because
theft
is
a
crime
in
their
own
estimation
and
it
must
be
observed
that
they
are
not
habitually
and
generally
guilty
of
it
towards
each
other
but
before
we
pronounce
them
a
more
depraved
people
than
any
other
it
were
well
to
consider
whether
the
lower
class
of
people
in
any
part
of
europe
would
have
acted
under
similar
circumstances
with
greater
honesty
towards
a
stranger
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
laws
of
the
country
afforded
me
no
protection
that
every
one
was
permitted
to
rob
me
with
impunity
and
that
some
part
of
my
effects
were
of
as
great
value
in
the
estimation
of
the
negroes
as
pearls
and
diamonds
would
have
been
in
the
eyes
of
a
european
let
us
suppose
a
black
merchant
of
hindostan
had
found
his
way
into
england
with
a
box
of
jewels
at
his
back
and
the
laws
of
the
kingdom
afforded
him
no
security
in
such
a
case
the
wonder
would
be
not
that
the
stranger
was
robbed
of
any
part
of
his
riches
but
that
any
part
was
left
for
a
second
depredator
aj
such
on
sober
reflection
is
the
judgment
i
have
formed
concerning
the
pilfering
disposition
of
the
mandingo
negroes
toward
me
footnote
aj
or
suppose
a
colored
pedler
with
valuable
goods
travelling
in
slave
states
where
the
laws
afford
little
or
no
protection
to
negro
property
what
would
probably
be
his
fate
on
the
other
hand
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
forget
the
disinterested
charity
and
tender
solicitude
with
which
many
of
these
poor
heathens
from
the
sovereign
of
sego
to
the
poor
women
who
at
different
times
received
me
into
their
cottages
sympathized
with
my
sufferings
relieved
my
distress
and
contributed
to
my
safety
perhaps
this
acknowledgment
is
more
particularly
due
to
the
female
part
of
the
nation
among
the
men
as
the
reader
must
have
seen
my
reception
though
generally
kind
was
sometimes
otherwise
it
varied
according
to
the
tempers
of
those
to
whom
i
made
application
avarice
in
some
and
bigotry
in
others
had
closed
up
the
avenues
to
compassion
but
i
do
not
recollect
a
single
instance
of
towards
me
in
the
women
in
all
my
wanderings
and
wretchedness
i
found
them
uniformly
kind
and
compassionate
and
i
can
truly
say
as
ledyard
has
eloquently
said
before
me
a
woman
i
never
addressed
myself
in
the
language
of
decency
and
friendship
without
receiving
a
decent
and
friendly
answer
if
i
was
hungry
or
thirsty
wet
or
ill
they
did
not
hesitate
like
the
men
to
perform
a
generous
action
in
so
free
and
so
kind
a
manner
did
they
contribute
to
my
relief
that
if
i
were
thirsty
i
drank
the
sweeter
draught
and
if
i
were
hungry
i
ate
the
coarsest
meal
with
a
double
relish
it
is
surely
reasonable
to
suppose
that
the
soft
and
amiable
sympathy
of
nature
thus
spontaneously
manifested
to
me
in
my
distress
is
displayed
by
these
poor
people
as
occasion
requires
much
more
strongly
toward
those
of
their
own
nation
and
neighborhood
maternal
affection
neither
suppressed
by
the
restraints
nor
diverted
by
the
solicitudes
of
civilized
life
is
every
where
conspicuous
among
them
and
creates
reciprocal
tenderness

the
child

said

negro
to
his
master
who
spoke
disrespectfully
of
his
parent
do
not
curse
my
mother
the
same
sentiment
i
found
to
prevail
universally
i
perceived
with
great
satisfaction
that
the
maternal
solicitude
extended
not
only
to
the
growth
and
security
of
the
person
but
also
in
a
certain
degree
to
the
improvement
of
the
character
for
one
of
the
first
lessons
which
the
mandingo
women
teach
their
children
is
the
practice
of
truth

poor
unhappy
mother

his
body
was
black

it
pleased

testify
by

the
whiteness
of
his
soul
he
died
at
palermo
in
where
his
tomb
and
memory
are
much
revered
a
few
years
ago
it
was
said
the
pope
was
about
to
authorize
his
canonization
whether
he
is
yet
registered
as
a
saint
in
the
calendar
i
know
not
but
many
writers
agree
that
he
was
a
saint
indeed
eminent
for
his
virtues
which
he
practised
in
meekness
and
silence
desiring
no
witness
but
his
god
the
moral
character
of
toussaint
is
even
more
worthy
of
admiration
than
his
intellectual
acuteness
what
can
be
more
beautiful
than
his
unchanging
gratitude
to
his
benefactor
his
warm
attachment
to
his

his
sacrifice
of
personal
feeling
to
the
public
good
he
was
a
hero
in
the
sublimest
sense
of
the
word
yet
he
had
no
white
blood
in
his
veins
he
was
all
negro
the
following
description
of
a
at
brazil
is
from
the
pen
of
doctor
walsh
the
men
were
generally
less
interesting
objects
than
the
women
their
countenances
and
hues
were
very
varied
according
to
the
part
of
the
african
coast
from
which
they
came
some
were
having
a
certain
ferocity
of
aspect
that
indicated
strong
and
fierce
passions
like
men
who
were
darkly
brooding
over
some
wrongs
and
meditating
revenge
when
any
one
was
ordered
he
came
forward
with
a
sullen
indifference
threw
his
arms
over
his
head
stamped
with
his
feet
shouted
to
show
the
soundness
of
his
lungs
ran
up
and
down
the
room
and
was
treated
exactly
like
a
horse
put
through
his
paces
at
a
repository
and
when
done
he
was
whipped
to
his
stall
many
of
them
were
lying
stretched
on
the
bare
boards
and
among
the
rest
mothers
with
young
children
at
their
breasts
of
which
they
seemed
passionately
fond
they
were
all
doomed
to
remain
on
the
spot
like
sheep
in
a
pen
till
they
were
sold
they
have
no
apartment
to
retire
to
no
bed
to
repose
on
no
covering
to
protect
them
they
sit
naked
all
day
and
lie
naked
all
night
on
the
bare
boards
or
benches
where
we
saw
them
exhibited
among
the
objects
that
attracted
my
attention
in
this
place
were
some
young
boys
who
seemed
to
have
formed
a
society
together
i
observed
several
times
in
passing
by
that
the
same
little
group
was
collected
near
a
barred
window
they
seemed
very
fond
of
each
other
and
their
kindly
feelings
were
never
interrupted
by
peevishness
indeed
the
temperament
of
a
negro
child
is
generally
so
sound
that
he
is
not
affected
by
those
little
morbid
sensations
which
are
the
frequent
cause
of
crossness
and
in
our
children
i
do
not
remember
that
i
ever
saw
a
young
black
fretful
or
out
of
humor
certainly
never
displaying
those
ferocious
fits
of
petty
passion
in
which
the
superior
nature
of
infant
whites
indulges
i
sometimes
brought
cakes
and
fruit
in
my
pocket
and
handed
them
in
to
the
group
it
was
quite
delightful
to
observe
the
generous
and
disinterested
manner
in
which
they
distributed
them
there
was
no
scrambling
with
one
another
no
selfish
reservation
to
themselves
the
child
to
whom
i
happened
to
give
them
took
them
so
gently
looked
so
thankfully
and
distributed
them
so
generously
that
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
god
had
compensated
their
dusky
hue
by
a
more
than
usual
human
portion
of
amiable
qualities
several
negroes
in
jamaica
were
to
be
hung
one
of
them
was
offered
his
life
if
he
would
hang
the
others
he
preferred
death
a
negro
slave
who
was
ordered
to
do
it
asked
time
to
prepare
he
went
into
his
cabin
chopped
off
his
right
hand
with
an
axe
and
then
came
back
saying
he
was
ready
sutcliff
in
his
travels
speaks
of
meeting
a
coffle
of
slaves
in
maryland
one
of
whom
had
voluntarily
gone
into
slavery
in
hopes
of
meeting
her
husband
who
was
a
free
black
and
had
been
stolen
by
kidnappers
the
poor
creature
was
in
treacherous
hands
and
it
is
a
great
chance
whether
she
ever
saw
her
husband
again
an
affecting
instance
of
negro
friendship
may
be
found
in
report
a
female
slave
in
south
carolina
was
allowed
to
work
out
in
the
town
on
condition
that
she
paid
her
master
a
certain
sum
of
money
per
month
being
strong
and
industrious
her
wages
amounted
to
more
than
had
been
demanded
in
their
agreement
after
a
time
she
earned
enough
to
buy
her
freedom
but
she
preferred
to
devote
the
sum
to
the
emancipation
of
a
negro
girl
named
sally
for
whom
she
had
conceived
a
strong
affection
for
a
long
time
the
master
pretended
to
have
no
property
in
his
slave
manumitted
friend
never
paid
taxes
for
her
and
often
spoke
of
her
as
a
free
negro
but
from
some
motive
or
other
he
afterward
claimed
sally
as
his
slave
on
the
ground
that
no
slave
could
make
any
purchase
on
his
own
account
or
possess
any
thing
which
did
not
legally
belong
to
his
master
it
is
an
honor
to
chief
justice
rutledge
that
his
charge
was
given
in
a
spirit
better
than
the
laws
he
concluded
by
saying
if
the
wench
choose
to
appropriate
the
savings
of
her
extra
labor
to
the
purchase
of
this
girl
in
order
to
set
her
free
will
a
jury
of
the
country
say
no
i
trust
not
i
hope
they
are
too
upright
and
humane
to
do
such
manifest
violence
to
such
an
extraordinary
act
of
benevolence
by
the
prompt
decision
of
the
jury
sally
was
declared
free
ak
footnote
ak
stroud
says
of
the
above
this
is
an
isolated
case
of
pretty
early
date
it
deserves
to
be
noticed
because
it
is
in
opposition
to
the
spirit
of
the
laws
and
to
decisions
of
the
courts
in
speaking
of
the
character
of
negroes
it
ought
not
to
be
omitted
that
many
of
them
were
brave
and
faithful
soldiers
during
our
revolution
some
are
now
receiving
pensions
for
their
services
at
likewise
the
conduct
of
the
colored
troops
was
deserving
of
the
highest
praise
it
is
common
to
speak
of
the
negroes
as
a
very
unfeeling
race
and
no
doubt
the
charge
has
considerable
truth
when
applied
to
those
in
a
state
of
bondage
for
slavery
blunts
the
feelings
as
well
as
stupifies
the
intellect
the
poor
negro
is
considered
as
having
no
right
in
his
wife
and
children
they
may
be
suddenly
torn
from
him
to
be
sold
in
a
distant
market
but
he
can
not
prevent
the
wrong
he
may
see
them
exposed
to
every
species
of
insult
and
indignity
but
the
law
which
stretches
forth
her
broad
shield
to
guard
the
white
man
rights
excludes
the
negro
from
her
protection
they
may
be
tied
to
the
and
under
punishment
but
he
dares
not
complain
if
he
murmur
there
is
the
tormenting
lash
if
he
resist
it
is
death
and
the
injustice
extends
even
beyond
the
grave
for
the
story
of
the
slave
is
told
by
his
oppressor
and
the
manly
spirit
which
the
poor
creature
shows
when
stung
to
the
very
heart
core
is
represented
as
diabolical
revenge
a
short
time
ago
i
read
in
a
georgia
paper
what
was
called
a
horrid
transaction
on
the
part
of
the
negro
a
slave
stood
by
and
saw
his
wife
whipped
as
long
as
he
could
possibly
endure
the
sight
he
then
called
out
to
the
overseer
who
was
applying
the
lash
that
he
would
kill
him
if
he
did
not
use
more
mercy
this
probably
made
matters
worse
at
all
events
the
lashing
continued
the
husband
goaded
to
frenzy
rushed
upon
the
overseer
and
stabbed
him
three
times
white
men
what
would
do
if
the
laws
admitted
that
your
wives
might
of
administered
by
your
employers
the
overseer
died
and
his
murderer
was
either
burned
or
shot
i
forget
which
the
georgia
editor
viewed
the
subject
only
on
one
side
the
monstrous
outrage
against
the
white
man
the
negro
wrongs
passed
for
nothing
it
was
very
gravely
added
to
the
account
probably
to
increase
the
odiousness
of
the
slave
offence
that
the
overseer
belonged
to
the
presbyterian
church
i
smiled
because
it
made
me
think
of
a
man
whom
i
once
heard
described
as
a
most
excellent
christian
that
would
steal
timber
to
build
a
church
this
instance
shows
that
even
slaves
are
not
quite
destitute
of
feeling
yet
we
could
not
wonder
at
it
if
they
were
who
could
expect
the
kindly
affections
to
expand
in
such
an
atmosphere
where
there
is
no
hope
the
heart
becomes
paralyzed
it
is
a
merciful
arrangement
of
divine
providence
by
which
the
acuteness
of
sensibility
is
lessened
when
it
becomes
merely
a
source
of
suffering
but
there
are
exceptions
to
this
general
rule
instances
of
very
strong
and
deep
affection
are
sometimes
found
in
a
state
of
hopeless
bondage
godwin
in
his
eloquent
lectures
on
colonial
slavery
quotes
the
following
anecdote
as
related
by
pennock
at
a
public
meeting
in
england
a
few
years
ago
it
was
enacted
that
it
should
not
be
legal
to
transport
once
established
slaves
from
one
island
to
another
and
a
gentleman
owner
finding
it
advisable
to
do
so
before
the
act
came
in
force
the
removal
of
a
great
part
of
his
was
the
consequence
he
had
a
female
slave
a
methodist
and
highly
valuable
to
him
not
the
less
so
for
being
the
mother
of
eight
or
nine
children
whose
husband
also
of
our
connection
was
the
property
of
another
resident
on
the
island
where
i
happened
to
be
at
the
time
their
masters
not
agreeing
on
a
sale
separation
ensued
and
i
went
to
the
beach
to
be
an
of
their
behavior
in
the
greatest
pang
of
all
one
by
one
the
man
kissed
his
children
with
the
firmness
of
a
hero
and
blessing
them
gave
as
his
last
words
oh
will
it
be
believed
and
have
no
influence
upon
our
veneration
for
the
negro
honest
and
obedient
to
your
master
at
length
he
had
to
take
leave
of
his
wife
there
he
stood
i
have
him
in
my
mind
eye
at
this
moment
five
or
six
yards
from
the
mother
of
his
children
unable
to
move
speak
or
do
any
thing
but
gaze
and
still
to
gaze
on
the
object
of
his
long
affection
soon
to
cross
the
blue
waves
for
ever
from
his
aching
sight
the
fire
of
his
eyes
alone
gave
indication
of
the
passion
within
until
after
some
minutes
standing
thus
he
fell
senseless
on
the
sand
as
if
suddenly
struck
down
by
the
hand
of
the
almighty
nature
could
do
no
more
the
blood
gushed
from
his
nostrils
and
mouth
as
if
rushing
from
the
terrors
of
the
conflict
within
and
amid
the
confusion
occasioned
by
the
circumstance
the
vessel
bore
off
his
family
for
ever
from
the
island
after
some
days
he
recovered
and
came
to
ask
advice
of
me
what
an
englishman
do
in
such
a
case
i
felt
the
blood
boiling
within
me
but
i
conquered
i
browbeat
my
own
manhood
and
gave
him
the
humblest
advice
i
could
the
following
account
is
given
by
gilgrass
one
of
the
methodist
missionaries
at
jamaica
a
master
of
slaves
who
lived
near
us
in
kingston
exercised
his
barbarities
on
a
sabbath
morning
while
we
were
worshiping
god
in
the
chapel
and
the
cries
of
the
female
sufferers
have
frequently
interrupted
us
in
our
devotions
but
there
was
no
redress
for
them
or
for
us
this
man
wanted
money
and
one
of
the
female
slaves
having
two
fine
children
he
sold
one
of
them
and
the
child
was
torn
from
her
maternal
affection
in
the
agony
of
her
feelings
she
made
a
hideous
howling
and
for
that
crime
she
was
flogged
soon
after
he
sold
her
other
child
this
her
heart
within
her
and
impelled
her
into
a
kind
of
madness
she
howled
night
and
day
in
the
yard
tore
her
hair
ran
up
and
down
the
streets
and
the
parade
rending
the
heavens
with
her
cries
and
literally
watering
the
earth
with
her
tears
her
constant
cry
was
wicked
massa
he
sell
me
children
will
no
buckra
master
pity
nega
what
me
do
me
have
no
child
as
she
stood
before
my
window
she
said
lifting
her
hands
towards
heaven
me
master
minister
pity
me
me
heart
do
so
shaking
herself
violently
me
heart
do
so
because
me
have
no
child
me
go
a
massa
house
in
massa
yard
and
in
me
hut
and
me
no
see
em
and
then
her
cry
went
up
to
god
i
durst
not
be
seen
looking
at
her
a
similar
instance
of
strong
affection
happened
in
the
city
of
washington
december
a
negro
woman
with
her
two
children
was
sold
near
bladensburg
to
georgia
traders
but
the
master
refused
to
sell
her
husband
when
the
coffle
reached
washington
on
their
way
to
georgia
the
poor
creature
attempted
to
escape
by
jumping
from
the
garret
window
of
a
brick
tavern
her
arms
and
back
were
dreadfully
broken
when
asked
why
she
had
done
such
a
desperate
act
she
replied
brought
me
away
and
would
let
me
see
my
husband
and
i
did
want
to
go
i
was
so
distracted
that
i
did
know
what
i
was
about
but
i
did
want
to
go
and
i
jumped
out
of
the
the
unfortunate
woman
was
given
to
the
landlord
as
a
compensation
for
having
her
taken
care
of
at
his
house
her
children
were
sold
in
carolina
and
thus
was
this
poor
forlorn
being
left
alone
in
her
misery
in
all
this
wide
land
of
benevolence
and
freedom
there
was
no
one
who
could
protect
her
for
in
such
cases
the
come
in
with
iron
grasp
to
check
the
stirrings
of
human
sympathy
another
complaint
is
that
slaves
have
most
inveterate
habits
of
laziness
no
doubt
this
is
true
it
would
be
strange
indeed
if
it
were
otherwise
where
is
the
human
being
who
will
work
from
a
disinterested
love
of
toil
when
his
labor
brings
no
improvement
to
himself
no
increase
of
comfort
to
his
wife
and
children
pelletan
in
his
memoirs
of
the
french
colony
of
senegal
says
the
negroes
work
with
ardor
because
they
are
now
unmolested
in
their
possessions
and
enjoyments
since
the
suppression
of
slavery
the
moors
make
no
more
inroads
upon
them
and
their
villages
are
rebuilt
and
bosman
who
was
by
no
means
very
friendly
to
colored
people
says
the
negroes
of
cabomonte
and
juido
are
indefatigable
cultivators
economical
of
their
soil
they
scarcely
leave
a
to
form
a
communication
between
the
different
possessions
they
reap
one
day
and
the
next
they
sow
the
same
earth
without
allowing
it
time
for
repose
it
is
needless
to
multiply
quotations
for
the
concurrent
testimony
of
all
travellers
proves
that
industry
is
a
common
virtue
in
the
interior
of
africa
again
it
is
said
that
the
negroes
are
treacherous
cunning
dishonest
and
profligate
let
me
ask
you
candid
reader
what
you
would
be
if
you
labored
under
the
same
unnatural
circumstances
the
daily
earnings
of
the
slave
nay
his
very
wife
and
children
are
constantly
wrested
from
him
under
the
sanction
of
the
laws
is
this
the
way
to
teach
a
scrupulous
regard
to
the
property
of
others
how
can
purity
be
expected
from
him
who
sees
almost
universal
licentiousness
prevail
among
those
whom
he
is
taught
to
regard
as
his
superiors
besides
we
must
remember
how
entirely
unprotected
the
negro
is
in
his
domestic
relations
and
how
very
frequently
husband
and
wife
are
separated
by
the
caprice
or
avarice
of
the
white
man
i
have
no
doubt
that
slaves
are
artful
for
they
be
so
cunning
is
always
the
resort
of
the
weak
against
the
strong
children
who
have
violent
and
unreasonable
parents
become
deceitful
in
the
only
way
to
make
young
people
sincere
and
frank
is
to
treat
them
with
mildness
and
perfect
justice
the
negro
often
pretends
to
be
ill
in
order
to
avoid
labor
and
if
you
were
situated
as
he
is
you
would
do
the
same
but
it
is
said
that
the
blacks
are
malignant
and
revengeful
granting
it
to
be
true
is
it
their
fault
or
is
it
owing
to
the
cruel
circumstances
in
which
they
are
placed
surely
there
are
proofs
enough
that
they
are
naturally
a
kind
and
gentle
people
true
they
do
sometimes
murder
their
masters
and
overseers
but
where
there
is
utter
hopelessness
can
we
wonder
at
occasional
desperation
i
do
not
believe
that
any
class
of
people
subject
to
the
same
influences
would
commit
fewer
crimes
dickson
in
his
letters
on
slavery
informs
us
that
among
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
negroes
and
creoles
of
barbadoes
only
three
murders
have
been
known
to
be
committed
by
them
in
the
course
of
thirty
years
although
often
provoked
by
the
cruelty
of
the
planters
in
estimating
the
vices
of
slaves
there
are
several
items
to
be
taken
into
the
account
in
the
first
place
we
hear
a
great
deal
of
the
negroes
crimes
while
we
hear
very
little
of
their
provocations
if
they
murder
their
masters
newspapers
and
almanacs
blazon
it
all
over
the
country
but
if
their
masters
murder
a
trifling
fine
is
paid
and
nobody
thinks
of
mentioning
the
matter
i
believe
there
are
twenty
negroes
killed
by
white
men
where
there
is
one
white
man
killed
by
a
black
if
you
believe
this
to
be
mere
conjecture
i
pray
you
examine
the
judicial
reports
of
the
southern
states
the
voice
of
concerning
this
subject
is
weak
and
stifled
and
when
a
master
kills
his
own
slave
we
are
not
likely
to
hear
the
tidings
but
the
voice
of
is
loud
and
strong
and
it
sometimes
happens
that
negroes
die
under
a
moderate
punishment
administered
by
other
hands
then
prosecutions
ensue
in
order
to
recover
the
price
of
the
slave
and
in
way
we
are
enabled
to
form
a
tolerable
conjecture
concerning
the
frequency
of
such
crimes
i
have
said
that
we
seldom
hear
of
the
grievous
wrongs
which
provoke
the
vengeance
of
the
slave
i
will
tell
an
anecdote
which
i
know
to
be
true
as
a
proof
in
point
within
the
last
two
years
a
gentleman
residing
in
boston
was
summoned
to
the
west
indies
in
consequence
of
troubles
on
his
plantation
his
overseer
had
been
killed
by
the
slaves
this
fact
was
soon
made
public
and
more
than
one
exclaimed
what
diabolical
passions
these
negroes
have
to
which
i
replied
that
i
only
wondered
they
were
half
as
good
as
they
were
it
was
not
long
however
before
i
discovered
the
particulars
of
the
case
and
i
took
some
pains
that
the
public
should
likewise
be
informed
of
them
the
overseer
was
a
bad
licentious
man
how
long
and
how
much
the
slaves
endured
under
his
power
i
know
not
but
at
last
he
took
a
fancy
to
two
of
the
wives
ordered
them
to
be
brought
to
his
house
and
in
spite
of
their
entreaties
and
resistance
compelled
them
to
remain
as
long
as
he
thought
proper
the
husbands
found
their
little
huts
deserted
and
knew
very
well
where
the
blame
rested
in
such
a
case
you
would
have
gone
to
law
but
the
law
does
not
recognise
a
negro
rights
he
is
the
of
his
master
and
subject
to
the
will
of
his
agent
if
a
slave
should
talk
of
being
protected
in
his
domestic
relations
it
would
cause
great
merriment
in
a
slaveholding
state
the
proposition
would
be
deemed
equally
inconvenient
and
absurd
under
such
circumstances
the
negro
husbands
took
justice
into
their
own
hands
they
murdered
the
overseer
four
innocent
slaves
were
taken
up
and
upon
very
slight
circumstantial
evidence
were
condemned
to
be
shot
but
the
real
actors
in
this
scene
passed
unsuspected
when
the
unhappy
men
found
their
companions
were
condemned
to
die
they
avowed
the
fact
and
exculpated
all
others
from
any
share
in
the
deed
was
not
this
true
magnanimity
can
you
help
respecting
those
negroes
if
you
can
i
pity
you
since
the
condition
of
slaves
is
such
as
i
have
described
are
you
surprised
at
occasional
insurrections
you
may
it
most
deeply
but
you
wonder
at
it
the
famous
captain
smith
when
he
was
a
slave
in
tartary
killed
his
overseer
and
made
his
escape
i
never
heard
him
blamed
for
it
it
seems
to
be
universally
considered
a
simple
act
of
the
same
thing
has
often
occurred
with
regard
to
white
men
taken
by
the
algerines
the
poles
have
shed
russian
blood
enough
to
float
our
navy
and
we
admire
and
praise
them
because
they
did
it
in
resistance
of
oppression
yet
they
have
suffered
less
than
black
slaves
all
the
world
over
are
suffering
we
honor
our
forefathers
because
they
rebelled
against
certain
principles
dangerous
to
political
freedom
yet
from
actual
personal
tyranny
they
suffered
nothing
the
negro
on
the
contrary
is
suffering
all
that
oppression
make
human
nature
suffer
why
do
we
execrate
in
one
set
of
men
what
we
laud
so
highly
in
another
i
shall
be
reminded
that
insurrections
and
murders
are
totally
at
variance
with
the
precepts
of
our
religion
and
this
is
most
true
but
according
to
this
rule
the
americans
poles
parisians
belgians
and
all
who
have
shed
blood
for
the
sake
of
liberty
are
more
to
blame
than
the
negroes
for
the
former
are
more
enlightened
and
can
always
have
access
to
the
fountain
of
religion
while
the
latter
are
kept
in
a
state
of
brutal
ignorance
not
allowed
to
read
their
bibles
knowing
nothing
of
christianity
except
the
examples
of
their
masters
who
profess
to
be
governed
by
its
maxims
i
hope
i
shall
not
be
misunderstood
on
this
point
i
am
not
vindicating
insurrections
and
murders
the
very
thought
makes
my
blood
run
cold
i
believe
revenge
is
wicked
but
i
say
what
the
laws
of
every
country
acknowledge
that
great
provocations
are
a
palliation
of
great
crimes
when
a
man
steals
food
because
he
is
starving
we
are
more
disposed
to
pity
than
to
blame
him
and
what
human
nature
do
subject
to
continual
and
oppressive
wrong
hopeless
of
change
not
only
unprotected
by
law
but
the
law
itself
changed
into
an
enemy
and
to
complete
the
whole
shut
out
from
the
instructions
and
consolations
of
the
gospel
no
wonder
the
west
india
missionaries
found
it
very
difficult
to
decide
what
they
ought
to
say
to
the
poor
suffering
negroes
they
could
indeed
tell
them
it
was
very
impolitic
to
be
rash
and
violent
because
it
could
not
under
existing
circumstances
make
their
situation
better
and
would
be
very
likely
to
make
it
worse
but
if
they
urged
the
maxims
of
religion
the
slaves
might
ask
the
embarrassing
question
is
not
our
treatment
in
direct
opposition
to
the
precepts
of
the
gospel
our
masters
can
read
the
bible
they
have
a
chance
to
know
better
why
do
not
christians
deal
justly
by
us
before
they
require
us
to
deal
mercifully
with
them
think
of
all
these
things
reader
try
to
judge
the
negro
by
the
same
rules
you
judge
other
men
and
while
you
condemn
his
faults
do
not
forget
his
manifold
provocations
chapter
viii
prejudices
against
people
of
color
and
our
duties
in
relation
to
this
subject
a
negro
has
a
an
please
your
honor
said
the
corporal
i
am
not
much
versed
corporal
quoth
my
uncle
toby
in
things
of
that
kind
but
i
suppose
god
would
not
leave
him
without
one
any
more
than
thee
or
me
it
would
be
putting
one
sadly
over
the
head
of
the
other
quoth
the
corporal
it
would
so
said
my
uncle
toby
why
then
an
please
your
honor
is
a
black
man
to
be
used
worse
than
a
white
one
i
can
give
no
reason
said
my
uncle
toby
only
cried
the
corporal
shaking
his
head
because
he
has
no
one
to
stand
up
for
him
it
is
that
very
thing
trim
quoth
my
uncle
toby
which
recommends
him
to
protection
while
we
bestow
our
earnest
disapprobation
on
the
system
of
slavery
let
us
not
flatter
ourselves
that
we
are
in
reality
any
better
than
our
brethren
of
the
south
thanks
to
our
soil
and
climate
and
the
early
exertions
of
the
excellent
society
of
friends
the
of
slavery
does
not
exist
among
us
but
the
very
of
the
hateful
and
mischievous
thing
is
here
in
all
its
strength
the
manner
in
which
we
use
what
power
we
have
gives
us
ample
reason
to
be
grateful
that
the
nature
of
our
institutions
does
not
intrust
us
with
more
our
prejudice
against
colored
people
is
even
more
inveterate
than
it
is
at
the
south
the
planter
is
often
attached
to
his
negroes
and
lavishes
caresses
and
kind
words
upon
them
as
he
would
on
a
favorite
hound
but
our
ignoble
prejudice
admits
of
no
exception
no
intermission
the
southerners
have
long
continued
habit
apparent
interest
and
dreaded
danger
to
palliate
the
wrong
they
do
but
we
stand
without
excuse
they
tell
us
that
northern
ships
and
northern
capital
have
been
engaged
in
this
wicked
business
and
the
reproach
is
true
several
fortunes
in
this
city
have
been
made
by
the
sale
of
negro
blood
if
these
criminal
transactions
are
still
carried
on
they
are
done
in
silence
and
secrecy
because
public
opinion
has
made
them
disgraceful
but
if
the
free
states
wished
to
cherish
the
system
of
slavery
for
ever
they
could
not
take
a
more
direct
course
than
they
now
do
those
who
are
kind
and
liberal
on
all
other
subjects
unite
with
the
selfish
and
the
proud
in
their
unrelenting
efforts
to
keep
the
colored
population
in
the
lowest
state
of
degradation
and
the
influence
they
unconsciously
exert
over
children
early
infuses
into
their
innocent
minds
the
same
strong
feelings
of
contempt
the
intelligent
and
have
the
least
share
of
this
prejudice
and
when
their
minds
can
be
brought
to
reflect
upon
it
i
have
generally
observed
that
they
soon
cease
to
have
any
at
all
but
such
a
general
apathy
prevails
and
the
subject
is
so
seldom
brought
into
view
that
few
are
really
aware
how
oppressively
the
influence
of
society
is
made
to
bear
upon
this
injured
class
of
the
community
when
i
have
related
facts
that
came
under
my
own
observation
i
have
often
been
listened
to
with
surprise
which
gradually
increased
to
indignation
in
order
that
my
readers
may
not
be
ignorant
of
the
extent
of
this
tyrannical
prejudice
i
will
as
briefly
as
possible
state
the
evidence
and
leave
them
to
judge
of
it
as
their
hearts
and
consciences
may
dictate
in
the
first
place
an
unjust
law
exists
in
this
commonwealth
by
which
marriages
between
persons
of
different
color
is
pronounced
illegal
i
am
perfectly
aware
of
the
gross
ridicule
to
which
i
may
subject
myself
by
alluding
to
this
particular
but
i
have
lived
too
long
and
observed
too
much
to
be
disturbed
by
the
world
mockery
in
the
first
place
the
government
ought
not
to
be
invested
with
power
to
control
the
affections
any
more
than
the
consciences
of
citizens
a
man
has
at
least
as
good
a
right
to
choose
his
wife
as
he
has
to
choose
his
religion
his
taste
may
not
suit
his
neighbors
but
so
long
as
his
deportment
is
correct
they
have
no
right
to
interfere
with
his
concerns
in
the
second
place
this
law
is
a
disgrace
to
massachusetts
under
existing
circumstances
none
but
those
whose
condition
in
life
is
too
low
to
be
much
affected
by
public
opinion
will
form
such
alliances
and
they
when
they
choose
to
do
so
make
such
marriages
in
spite
of
the
law
i
know
two
or
three
instances
where
women
of
the
laboring
class
have
been
united
to
reputable
industrious
colored
men
these
husbands
regularly
bring
home
their
wages
and
are
kind
to
their
families
if
by
some
of
the
odd
chances
which
not
unfrequently
occur
in
the
world
their
wives
should
become
heirs
to
any
property
the
children
may
be
wronged
out
of
it
because
the
law
pronounces
them
illegitimate
and
while
this
injustice
exists
with
regard
to
industrious
individuals
who
are
merely
guilty
of
differing
from
us
in
a
matter
of
taste
neither
the
legislation
nor
customs
of
slaveholding
states
exert
their
influence
against
connexions
in
one
portion
of
our
country
this
fact
is
shown
in
a
very
peculiar
and
striking
manner
there
is
a
numerous
class
at
called
quateroons
or
quadroons
because
their
colored
blood
has
for
several
successive
generations
been
intermingled
with
the
white
the
women
are
much
distinguished
for
personal
beauty
and
gracefulness
of
motion
and
their
parents
frequently
send
them
to
france
for
the
advantages
of
an
elegant
education
white
gentlemen
of
the
first
rank
are
desirous
of
being
invited
to
their
parties
and
often
become
seriously
in
love
with
these
fascinating
but
unfortunate
beings
prejudice
forbids
matrimony
but
universal
custom
sanctions
temporary
connexions
to
which
a
certain
degree
of
respectability
is
allowed
on
account
of
the
peculiar
situation
of
the
parties
these
attachments
often
continue
for
years
sometimes
for
life
and
instances
are
not
unfrequent
of
exemplary
constancy
and
great
propriety
of
deportment
what
eloquent
vituperations
we
should
pour
forth
if
the
contending
claims
of
nature
and
pride
produced
such
a
tissue
of
contradictions
in
some
other
country
and
not
in
our
own
there
is
another
massachusetts
law
which
an
enlightened
community
would
not
probably
suffer
to
be
carried
into
execution
under
any
circumstances
but
it
still
remains
to
disgrace
the
statutes
of
this
commonwealth
it
is
as
follows
no
african
or
negro
other
than
a
subject
of
the
emperor
of
morocco
or
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
proved
so
by
a
certificate
of
the
secretary
of
the
state
of
which
he
is
a
citizen
shall
tarry
within
this
commonwealth
longer
than
two
months
and
on
complaint
a
justice
shall
order
him
to
depart
in
ten
days
and
if
he
do
not
then
the
justice
may
commit
such
african
or
negro
to
the
house
of
correction
there
to
be
kept
at
hard
labor
and
at
the
next
term
of
the
court
of
common
pleas
he
shall
be
tried
and
if
convicted
of
remaining
as
aforesaid
shall
be
whipped
not
exceeding
ten
lashes
and
if
he
or
she
shall
not
depart
such
process
shall
be
repeated
and
punishment
inflicted
stat
ch
an
honorable
haytian
or
brazilian
who
visited
this
country
for
business
or
information
might
come
under
this
law
unless
public
opinion
rendered
it
a
mere
dead
letter
there
is
among
the
colored
people
an
increasing
desire
for
information
and
laudable
ambition
to
be
respectable
in
manners
and
appearance
are
we
not
foolish
as
well
as
sinful
in
trying
to
repress
a
tendency
so
salutary
to
themselves
and
so
beneficial
to
the
community
several
individuals
of
this
class
are
very
desirous
to
have
persons
of
their
own
color
qualified
to
teach
something
more
than
mere
reading
and
writing
but
in
the
public
schools
colored
children
are
subject
to
many
discouragements
and
difficulties
and
into
the
private
schools
they
can
not
gain
admission
a
very
sensible
and
colored
woman
in
a
neighboring
town
whose
family
have
been
brought
up
in
a
manner
that
excited
universal
remark
and
approbation
has
been
extremely
desirous
to
obtain
for
her
eldest
daughter
the
advantages
of
a
private
school
but
she
has
been
resolutely
repulsed
on
account
of
her
complexion
the
girl
is
a
very
light
mulatto
with
great
modesty
and
propriety
of
manners
perhaps
no
young
person
in
the
commonwealth
was
less
likely
to
have
a
bad
influence
on
her
associates
the
clergyman
respected
the
family
and
he
remonstrated
with
the
instructer
but
while
the
latter
admitted
the
injustice
of
the
thing
he
excused
himself
by
saying
such
a
step
would
occasion
the
loss
of
all
his
white
scholars
in
a
town
adjoining
boston
a
well
behaved
colored
boy
was
kept
out
of
the
public
school
more
than
a
year
by
vote
of
the
trustees
his
mother
having
some
information
herself
knew
the
importance
of
knowledge
and
was
anxious
to
obtain
it
for
her
family
she
wrote
repeatedly
and
urgently
and
the
schoolmaster
himself
told
me
that
the
correctness
of
her
spelling
and
the
neatness
of
her
formed
a
curious
contrast
with
the
notes
he
received
from
many
white
parents
at
last
this
spirited
woman
appeared
before
the
committee
and
reminded
them
that
her
husband
having
for
many
years
paid
taxes
as
a
citizen
had
a
right
to
the
privileges
of
a
citizen
and
if
her
claim
were
refused
or
longer
postponed
she
declared
her
determination
to
seek
justice
from
a
higher
source
the
trustees
were
of
course
obliged
to
yield
to
the
equality
of
the
laws
with
the
best
grace
they
could
the
boy
was
admitted
and
made
good
progress
in
his
studies
had
his
mother
been
too
ignorant
to
know
her
rights
or
too
abject
to
demand
them
the
lad
would
have
had
a
fair
chance
to
get
a
living
out
of
the
state
as
the
occupant
of
a
workhouse
or
penitentiary
the
attempt
to
establish
a
school
for
african
girls
at
canterbury
connecticut
has
made
too
much
noise
to
need
a
detailed
account
in
this
volume
i
do
not
know
the
lady
who
first
formed
the
project
but
i
am
told
that
she
is
a
benevolent
and
religious
woman
it
certainly
is
difficult
to
imagine
any
other
motives
than
good
ones
for
an
undertaking
so
arduous
and
unpopular
yet
had
the
pope
himself
attempted
to
establish
his
supremacy
over
that
commonwealth
he
could
hardly
have
been
repelled
with
more
determined
and
angry
resistance
were
held
the
records
of
which
are
not
highly
creditable
to
the
parties
concerned
petitions
were
sent
to
the
legislature
beseeching
that
no
african
school
might
be
allowed
to
admit
individuals
not
residing
in
the
town
where
said
school
was
established
and
strange
to
relate
this
law
which
makes
it
impossible
to
collect
a
sufficient
number
of
pupils
was
sanctioned
by
the
state
a
colored
girl
who
availed
herself
of
this
opportunity
to
gain
instruction
was
warned
out
of
town
and
fined
for
not
complying
and
the
instructress
was
imprisoned
for
persevering
in
her
benevolent
plan
it
was
said
in
excuse
that
canterbury
would
be
inundated
with
vicious
characters
who
would
corrupt
the
morals
of
the
young
men
that
such
a
school
would
break
down
the
distinctions
between
black
and
white
and
that
marriages
between
people
of
different
colors
would
be
the
probable
result
yet
they
assumed
the
ground
that
colored
people
always
be
an
inferior
and
degraded
class
that
the
prejudice
against
them
be
eternal
being
deeply
founded
in
the
laws
of
god
and
nature
finally
they
endeavored
to
represent
the
school
as
one
of
the
proceedings
of
the
society
and
they
appealed
to
the
colonization
society
as
an
aggrieved
child
is
wont
to
appeal
to
its
parent
the
objection
with
regard
to
the
introduction
of
vicious
characters
into
a
village
certainly
has
some
force
but
are
such
persons
likely
to
leave
cities
for
a
quiet
country
town
in
search
of
moral
and
intellectual
improvement
is
it
not
obvious
that
the
portion
of
the
colored
class
are
the
very
ones
to
prize
such
an
opportunity
for
instruction
grant
that
a
large
proportion
of
these
unfortunate
people
vicious
is
it
not
our
duty
and
of
course
our
wisest
policy
to
try
to
make
them
otherwise
and
what
will
so
effectually
elevate
their
character
and
condition
as
knowledge
i
beseech
you
my
countrymen
think
of
these
things
wisely
and
in
season
as
for
intermarriages
if
there
be
such
a
repugnance
between
the
two
races
founded
in
the
laws
of
methinks
there
is
small
reason
to
dread
their
frequency
the
breaking
down
of
distinctions
in
society
by
means
of
extended
information
is
an
objection
which
appropriately
belongs
to
the
emperor
of
austria
or
the
sultan
of
egypt
i
do
not
know
how
the
affair
at
canterbury
is
considered
but
i
have
heard
individuals
of
all
parties
and
all
opinions
speak
of
it
and
never
without
merriment
or
indignation
fifty
years
hence
the
laws
of
connecticut
will
be
a
greater
source
of
amusement
to
the
antiquarian
than
her
famous
laws
a
similar
though
less
violent
opposition
arose
in
consequence
of
the
attempt
to
establish
a
college
for
colored
people
at
a
young
colored
man
who
tried
to
obtain
education
at
the
wesleyan
college
in
middletown
was
obliged
to
relinquish
the
attempt
on
account
of
the
persecution
of
his
fellow
students
some
collegians
from
the
south
objected
to
a
colored
associate
in
their
recitations
and
those
from
promptly
and
zealously
joined
in
the
hue
and
cry
a
small
but
firm
party
were
in
favor
of
giving
the
colored
man
a
chance
to
pursue
his
studies
without
insult
or
interruption
and
i
am
told
that
this
manly
and
disinterested
band
were
all
southerners
as
for
those
individuals
who
exerted
their
influence
to
exclude
an
unoffending
from
privileges
which
ought
to
be
equally
open
to
all
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
age
will
make
them
wiser
and
that
they
will
learn
before
they
die
to
be
ashamed
of
a
step
attended
with
more
important
results
than
usually
belong
to
youthful
follies
it
happens
that
these
experiments
have
all
been
made
in
connecticut
but
it
is
no
more
than
justice
to
that
state
to
remark
that
a
similar
spirit
would
probably
have
been
manifested
in
massachusetts
under
like
circumstances
at
our
debating
clubs
and
other
places
of
public
discussion
the
demon
of
prejudice
girds
himself
for
the
battle
the
moment
negro
colleges
and
high
schools
are
alluded
to
alas
while
we
carry
on
our
lips
that
religion
which
teaches
us
to
love
our
neighbors
as
ourselves
how
little
do
we
cherish
its
blessed
influence
within
our
hearts
how
much
republicanism
we
have
to
of
and
how
little
do
we
practise
let
us
seriously
consider
what
injury
a
negro
college
could
possibly
do
us
it
is
certainly
a
fair
presumption
that
the
scholars
would
be
from
the
better
portion
of
the
colored
population
and
it
is
an
equally
fair
presumption
that
knowledge
would
improve
their
characters
there
are
already
many
hundreds
of
colored
people
in
the
city
of
boston
in
the
street
they
generally
appear
neat
and
respectable
and
in
our
houses
they
do
not
come
between
the
wind
and
our
nobility
would
the
addition
of
one
or
two
hundred
more
even
be
perceived
as
for
giving
offence
to
the
southerners
by
allowing
such
establishments
they
have
no
right
to
interfere
with
our
internal
concerns
any
more
than
we
have
with
theirs
why
should
they
not
give
up
slavery
to
please
us
by
the
same
rule
that
we
must
refrain
from
educating
the
negroes
to
please
them
if
they
are
at
liberty
to
do
wrong
we
certainly
ought
to
be
at
liberty
to
do
right
they
may
talk
and
publish
as
much
about
us
as
they
please
and
we
ask
for
no
other
influence
over
them
it
is
a
fact
not
generally
known
that
the
brave
kosciusko
left
a
fund
for
the
establishment
of
a
negro
college
in
the
united
states
little
did
he
think
he
had
been
fighting
for
a
people
who
would
not
grant
one
rood
of
their
vast
territory
for
the
benevolent
purpose
according
to
present
appearances
a
college
for
colored
persons
will
be
established
in
canada
and
thus
by
means
of
our
foolish
and
wicked
pride
the
credit
of
this
philanthropic
enterprise
will
be
transferred
to
our
mother
country
the
preceding
chapters
show
that
it
has
been
no
uncommon
thing
for
colored
men
to
be
educated
at
english
german
portuguese
and
spanish
universities
in
boston
there
is
an
infant
school
three
primary
schools
and
a
grammar
school
the
two
last
are
i
believe
supported
by
the
public
and
this
fact
is
highly
creditable
i
was
much
pleased
with
the
late
resolution
awarding
franklin
medals
to
the
colored
pupils
of
the
grammar
school
and
i
was
still
more
pleased
with
the
laudable
project
originated
by
josiah
holbrook
for
the
establishment
of
a
colored
lyceum
surely
a
better
spirit
beginning
to
work
in
this
cause
and
when
once
begun
the
good
sense
and
good
feeling
of
the
community
will
bid
it
go
on
and
prosper
how
much
this
spirit
will
have
to
contend
with
is
illustrated
by
the
following
fact
when
president
jackson
entered
this
city
the
white
children
of
all
the
schools
were
sent
out
in
uniform
to
do
him
honor
a
member
of
the
committee
proposed
that
the
pupils
of
the
african
schools
should
be
invited
likewise
but
he
was
the
only
one
who
voted
for
it
he
then
proposed
that
the
yeas
and
nays
should
be
recorded
upon
which
most
of
the
gentlemen
walked
off
to
prevent
the
question
from
being
taken
perhaps
they
felt
an
awkward
consciousness
of
the
incongeniality
of
such
proceedings
with
our
republican
institutions
by
order
of
the
committee
the
vacation
of
the
african
schools
did
not
commence
until
the
day
after
the
procession
of
the
white
pupils
and
a
note
to
the
instructer
intimated
that
the
pupils
were
not
expected
to
appear
on
the
common
the
reason
given
was
because
their
numbers
were
so
few
but
in
private
conversation
fears
were
expressed
lest
their
sable
faces
should
give
offence
to
our
slaveholding
president
in
all
probability
the
sight
of
the
colored
children
would
have
been
agreeable
to
general
jackson
and
seemed
more
like
home
than
any
thing
he
witnessed
in
the
theatre
it
is
not
possible
for
respectable
colored
people
to
obtain
a
decent
seat
they
must
either
be
excluded
or
herd
with
the
vicious
a
fierce
excitement
prevailed
not
long
since
because
a
colored
man
had
bought
a
pew
in
one
of
our
churches
i
heard
a
very
and
zealous
democrat
declare
his
opinion
that
the
fellow
ought
to
be
turned
out
by
constables
if
he
dared
to
occupy
the
pew
he
had
purchased
even
at
the
the
mockery
of
human
pride
is
mingled
with
the
worship
of
jehovah
again
and
again
have
i
seen
a
solitary
negro
come
up
to
the
altar
meekly
and
timidly
after
all
the
white
communicants
had
retired
one
episcopal
clergyman
of
this
city
forms
an
honorable
exception
to
this
remark
when
there
is
room
at
the
altar
often
makes
a
signal
to
the
colored
members
of
his
church
to
kneel
beside
their
white
brethren
and
once
when
two
white
infants
and
one
colored
one
were
to
be
baptized
and
the
parents
of
the
latter
bashfully
lingered
far
behind
the
others
he
silently
rebuked
the
unchristian
spirit
of
pride
by
first
administering
the
holy
ordinance
to
the
little
child
of
god
an
instance
of
prejudice
lately
occurred
which
i
should
find
it
hard
to
believe
did
i
not
positively
know
it
to
be
a
fact
a
gallery
pew
was
purchased
in
one
of
our
churches
for
two
hundred
dollars
a
few
sabbaths
after
an
address
was
delivered
at
that
church
in
favor
of
the
africans
some
colored
people
who
very
naturally
wished
to
hear
the
discourse
went
into
the
gallery
probably
because
they
thought
they
should
be
deemed
less
intrusive
there
than
elsewhere
the
man
who
had
recently
bought
a
pew
found
it
occupied
by
colored
people
and
indignantly
retired
with
his
family
the
next
day
he
purchased
a
pew
in
another
protesting
that
nothing
would
tempt
him
again
to
make
use
of
seats
that
had
been
occupied
by
negroes
a
well
known
country
representative
who
makes
a
very
loud
noise
about
his
democracy
once
attended
the
catholic
church
a
pious
negro
requested
him
to
take
off
his
hat
while
he
stood
in
the
presence
of
the
virgin
mary
the
white
man
rudely
shoved
him
aside
saying
you
son
of
an
ethiopian
do
you
dare
to
speak
to
me
i
more
than
once
heard
the
hero
repeat
this
story
and
he
seemed
to
take
peculiar
satisfaction
in
telling
it
had
he
been
less
ignorant
he
would
not
have
chosen
son
of
an
as
an
epithet
to
have
called
the
african
his
own
equal
would
have
been
abundantly
more
sarcastic
the
same
republican
dismissed
a
strong
industrious
colored
man
who
had
been
employed
on
the
farm
during
his
absence
i
am
too
great
a
democrat
quoth
he
to
have
any
body
in
my
house
who
do
sit
at
my
table
and
i
be
hanged
if
i
ever
eat
with
the
son
of
an
ethiopian
men
whose
education
leaves
them
less
excuse
for
such
illiberality
are
yet
vulgar
enough
to
join
in
this
ridiculous
prejudice
the
colored
woman
whose
daughter
has
been
mentioned
as
excluded
from
a
private
school
was
once
smuggled
into
a
stage
upon
the
supposition
that
she
was
a
white
woman
with
a
sallow
complexion
her
manners
were
modest
and
prepossessing
and
the
gentlemen
were
very
polite
to
her
but
when
she
stopped
at
her
own
door
and
was
handed
out
by
her
husband
they
were
at
once
surprised
and
angry
to
find
they
had
been
riding
with
a
mulatto
and
had
in
their
ignorance
been
really
civil
to
her
a
worthy
colored
woman
belonging
to
an
adjoining
town
wished
to
come
into
boston
to
attend
upon
a
son
who
was
she
had
a
trunk
with
her
and
was
too
feeble
to
walk
she
begged
permission
to
ride
in
the
stage
but
the
passengers
with
indignation
declared
they
would
get
out
if
she
were
allowed
to
get
in
after
much
entreaty
the
driver
suffered
her
to
sit
by
him
upon
the
box
when
he
entered
the
city
his
comrades
began
to
point
and
sneer
not
having
sufficient
moral
courage
to
endure
this
he
left
the
poor
woman
with
her
trunk
in
the
middle
of
the
street
far
from
the
place
of
her
destination
telling
her
with
an
oath
that
he
would
not
carry
her
a
step
further
a
friend
of
mine
lately
wished
to
have
a
colored
girl
admitted
into
the
stage
with
her
to
take
care
of
her
babe
the
girl
was
very
lightly
tinged
with
the
sable
hue
had
handsome
indian
features
and
very
pleasing
manners
it
was
however
evident
that
she
was
not
white
and
therefore
the
passengers
objected
to
her
company
this
of
course
produced
a
good
deal
of
inconvenience
on
one
side
and
mortification
on
the
other
my
friend
repeated
the
circumstance
to
a
lady
who
as
the
daughter
and
wife
of
a
clergyman
might
be
supposed
to
have
imbibed
some
liberality
the
lady
seemed
to
think
the
experiment
was
very
preposterous
but
when
my
friend
alluded
to
the
mixed
parentage
of
the
girl
she
exclaimed
with
generous
enthusiasm
oh
that
alters
the
case
certainly
their
rights
every
year
a
colored
gentleman
and
scholar
is
becoming
less
and
less
of
a
rarity
thanks
to
the
existence
of
the
haytian
republic
and
the
increasing
liberality
of
the
world
yet
if
a
person
of
refinement
from
hayti
brazil
or
other
countries
which
we
deem
less
enlightened
than
our
own
should
visit
us
the
very
boys
of
this
republic
would
dog
his
footsteps
with
the
vulgar
outcry
of
nigger
nigger
i
have
known
this
to
be
done
from
no
other
provocation
than
the
sight
of
a
colored
man
with
the
dress
and
deportment
of
a
gentleman
were
it
not
that
republicanism
like
christianity
is
often
perverted
from
its
true
spirit
by
the
bad
passions
of
mankind
such
things
as
these
would
make
every
honest
mind
disgusted
with
the
very
name
of
republics
i
am
acquainted
with
a
gentleman
from
brazil
who
is
shrewd
enterprising
and
respectable
in
character
and
manners
yet
he
has
experienced
almost
every
species
of
indignity
on
account
of
his
color
not
long
since
it
became
necessary
for
him
to
visit
the
southern
shores
of
massachusetts
to
settle
certain
accounts
connected
with
his
business
his
wife
was
in
a
feeble
state
of
health
and
the
physicians
had
recommended
a
voyage
for
this
reason
he
took
passage
for
her
with
himself
in
the
and
the
captain
as
it
appears
made
no
objection
to
a
colored
gentleman
money
after
remaining
on
deck
some
time
attempted
to
pass
into
the
cabin
but
the
captain
prevented
her
saying
you
must
go
down
forward
the
brazilian
urged
that
he
had
paid
the
customary
price
and
therefore
his
wife
and
infant
had
a
right
to
a
place
in
the
ladies
cabin
the
captain
answered
your
wife
a
lady
she
is
a
nigger
the
forward
cabin
was
occupied
by
sailors
was
entirely
without
accommodations
for
women
and
admitted
the
so
that
a
person
could
not
sit
in
it
comfortably
without
keeping
the
feet
raised
in
a
chair
the
husband
stated
that
his
health
would
not
admit
of
such
exposure
to
which
the
captain
still
replied
i
do
allow
any
niggers
in
my
cabin
with
natural
and
honest
indignation
the
brazilian
exclaimed
you
americans
talk
about
the
poles
you
are
a
great
deal
more
russian
than
the
russians
the
affair
was
concluded
by
placing
the
colored
gentleman
and
his
invalid
wife
on
the
shore
and
leaving
them
to
provide
for
themselves
as
they
could
had
the
cabin
been
full
there
would
have
been
some
excuse
but
it
was
occupied
only
by
two
sailors
wives
the
same
individual
sent
for
a
relative
in
a
distant
town
on
account
of
illness
in
his
family
after
staying
several
weeks
it
became
necessary
for
her
to
return
and
he
procured
a
seat
for
her
in
the
stage
the
same
ridiculous
scene
occurred
the
passengers
were
afraid
of
losing
their
dignity
by
riding
with
a
neat
respectable
person
whose
face
was
darker
than
their
own
no
public
vehicle
could
be
obtained
by
which
a
colored
citizen
could
be
conveyed
to
her
home
it
therefore
became
absolutely
necessary
for
the
gentleman
to
leave
his
business
and
hire
a
chaise
at
great
expense
such
proceedings
are
really
inexcusable
no
authority
can
be
found
for
them
in
religion
reason
or
the
laws
the
bible
informs
us
that
a
man
of
ethiopia
a
eunuch
of
great
authority
under
candace
queen
of
the
ethiopians
who
had
charge
of
all
her
treasure
came
to
jerusalem
to
worship
returning
in
his
chariot
he
read
esaias
the
prophet
and
at
his
request
philip
went
up
into
the
chariot
and
sat
with
him
explaining
the
scriptures
where
should
we
now
find
an
apostle
who
would
ride
in
the
same
chariot
with
an
ethiopian
will
any
candid
person
tell
me
why
respectable
colored
people
should
not
be
allowed
to
make
use
of
public
conveyances
open
to
all
who
are
able
and
willing
to
pay
for
the
privilege
those
who
enter
a
vessel
or
a
can
not
expect
to
select
their
companions
if
they
can
afford
to
take
a
carriage
or
boat
for
themselves
then
and
then
only
they
have
a
right
to
be
exclusive
i
was
lately
talking
with
a
young
gentleman
on
this
subject
who
professed
to
have
no
prejudice
against
colored
people
except
so
far
as
they
were
ignorant
and
vulgar
but
still
he
could
not
tolerate
the
idea
of
allowing
them
to
enter
stages
and
yet
you
allow
the
same
privilege
to
vulgar
and
ignorant
white
men
without
a
murmur
i
replied
pray
give
a
good
republican
reason
why
a
respectable
colored
citizen
should
be
less
favored
for
want
of
a
better
argument
he
said
pardon
me
fastidious
reader
he
implied
that
the
presence
of
colored
persons
was
less
agreeable
than
otto
of
rose
or
eau
de
cologne
and
this
distinction
he
urged
was
made
by
god
himself
i
answered
whoever
takes
his
chance
in
a
public
vehicle
is
liable
to
meet
with
uncleanly
white
passengers
whose
breath
may
be
redolent
with
the
fumes
of
american
cigars
or
american
gin
neither
of
these
articles
have
a
fragrance
peculiarly
agreeable
to
nerves
of
delicate
organization
allowing
your
argument
double
the
weight
it
deserves
it
is
utter
nonsense
to
pretend
that
the
inconvenience
in
the
case
i
have
supposed
is
not
infinitely
greater
but
what
is
more
to
the
point
do
you
dine
in
a
fashionable
hotel
do
you
sail
in
a
fashionable
do
you
sup
at
a
fashionable
house
without
having
negro
servants
behind
your
chair
would
they
be
any
more
disagreeable
as
seated
in
the
corner
of
a
stage
or
a
than
as
in
such
immediate
attendance
upon
your
person
are
very
much
perplexed
when
they
attempt
to
vindicate
the
present
tyrannical
customs
and
they
usually
give
up
the
point
by
saying
they
themselves
have
no
prejudice
against
colored
people
they
are
merely
afraid
of
the
public
but
should
remember
that
in
a
popular
government
they
in
common
with
every
other
citizen
form
a
part
and
portion
of
the
dreaded
public
the
gold
was
never
coined
for
which
i
would
barter
my
individual
freedom
of
acting
and
thinking
upon
any
subject
or
knowingly
interfere
with
the
rights
of
the
meanest
human
being
the
only
true
courage
is
that
which
impels
us
to
do
right
without
regard
to
consequences
to
fear
a
populace
is
as
servile
as
to
fear
an
emperor
the
only
salutary
restraint
is
the
fear
of
doing
wrong
our
representatives
to
congress
have
repeatedly
rode
in
a
stage
with
colored
servants
at
the
request
of
their
masters
whether
this
is
because
are
willing
to
do
out
of
courtesy
to
a
southern
gentleman
what
they
object
to
doing
from
justice
to
a
colored
citizen
or
whether
those
representatives
being
educated
men
were
more
than
usually
divested
of
this
absurd
prejudice
i
will
not
pretend
to
say
the
state
of
public
feeling
not
only
makes
it
difficult
for
the
africans
to
obtain
information
but
it
prevents
them
from
making
profitable
use
of
what
knowledge
they
have
a
colored
man
however
intelligent
is
not
allowed
to
pursue
any
business
more
lucrative
than
that
of
a
barber
a
or
a
waiter
these
and
all
other
employments
are
truly
respectable
whenever
the
duties
connected
with
them
are
faithfully
performed
but
it
is
unjust
that
a
man
should
on
account
of
his
complexion
be
prevented
from
performing
more
elevated
uses
in
society
every
citizen
ought
to
have
a
fair
chance
to
try
his
fortune
in
any
line
of
business
which
he
thinks
he
has
ability
to
transact
why
should
not
colored
men
be
employed
in
the
manufactories
of
various
kinds
if
their
ignorance
is
an
objection
let
them
be
enlightened
as
speedily
as
possible
if
their
moral
character
is
not
sufficiently
pure
remove
the
pressure
of
public
scorn
and
thus
supply
them
with
motives
for
being
respectable
all
this
can
be
done
it
merely
requires
an
earnest
wish
to
overcome
a
prejudice
which
has
grown
with
our
growth
and
strengthened
with
our
strength
but
which
is
in
fact
opposed
to
the
spirit
of
our
religion
and
contrary
to
the
instinctive
good
feelings
of
our
nature
when
examined
by
the
clear
light
of
reason
it
disappears
prejudices
of
all
kinds
have
their
strongest
holds
in
the
minds
of
the
vulgar
and
the
ignorant
in
a
community
so
enlightened
as
our
own
they
must
gradually
melt
away
under
the
influence
of
public
discussion
there
is
no
want
of
kind
feelings
and
liberal
sentiments
in
the
american
people
the
simple
fact
is
they
have
not
upon
this
subject
an
active
and
enterprising
community
are
not
apt
to
concern
themselves
about
laws
and
customs
which
do
not
obviously
interfere
with
their
interests
or
convenience
and
various
political
and
prudential
motives
have
combined
to
fetter
free
inquiry
in
this
direction
thus
we
have
gone
on
year
after
year
thoughtlessly
sanctioning
by
our
silence
and
indifference
evils
which
our
hearts
and
consciences
are
far
enough
from
approving
it
has
been
shown
that
no
other
people
on
earth
indulge
so
strong
a
prejudice
with
regard
to
color
as
we
do
it
is
urged
that
negroes
are
civilly
treated
in
england
because
their
numbers
are
so
few
i
could
never
discover
any
great
force
in
this
argument
colored
people
are
certainly
not
sufficiently
rare
in
that
country
to
be
regarded
as
a
great
show
like
a
giraffe
or
a
sandwich
island
king
and
on
the
other
hand
it
would
seem
natural
that
those
who
were
more
accustomed
to
the
sight
of
dark
faces
would
find
their
aversion
diminished
rather
than
increased
the
absence
of
prejudice
in
the
portuguese
and
spanish
settlements
is
accounted
for
by
saying
that
the
white
people
are
very
little
superior
to
the
negroes
in
knowledge
and
refinement
but
doctor
walsh
book
certainly
gives
us
no
reason
to
think
meanly
of
the
brazilians
and
it
has
been
my
good
fortune
to
be
acquainted
with
many
highly
intelligent
south
americans
who
were
divested
of
this
prejudice
and
much
surprised
at
its
existence
here
if
the
south
americans
are
really
in
such
a
low
state
as
the
argument
implies
it
is
a
still
greater
disgrace
to
us
to
be
outdone
in
liberality
and
consistent
republicanism
by
men
so
much
less
enlightened
than
ourselves
pride
will
doubtless
hold
out
with
strength
and
adroitness
against
the
besiegers
of
its
fortress
but
it
is
an
obvious
truth
that
the
condition
of
the
world
is
rapidly
improving
and
that
our
laws
and
customs
must
change
with
it
neither
ancient
nor
modern
history
furnishes
a
page
more
glorious
than
the
last
twenty
years
in
england
for
at
every
step
free
principles
after
a
long
and
arduous
struggle
have
conquered
selfishness
and
tyranny
almost
all
great
evils
are
resisted
by
individuals
who
directly
suffer
injustice
or
inconvenience
from
them
but
it
is
a
peculiar
beauty
of
the
abolition
cause
that
its
defenders
enter
the
lists
against
wealth
and
power
and
talent
not
to
defend
their
own
rights
but
to
protect
weak
and
injured
neighbors
who
are
not
allowed
to
speak
for
themselves
those
who
become
interested
in
a
cause
laboring
so
heavily
under
the
pressure
of
present
unpopularity
must
expect
to
be
assailed
by
every
form
of
bitterness
and
sophistry
at
times
discouraged
and
they
will
perhaps
begin
to
doubt
whether
there
are
in
reality
any
unalterable
principles
of
right
and
wrong
but
let
them
cast
aside
the
fear
of
man
and
keep
their
minds
fixed
on
a
few
of
the
simple
unchangeable
laws
of
god
and
they
will
certainly
receive
strength
to
contend
with
the
adversary
paragraphs
in
the
southern
papers
already
begin
to
imply
that
the
united
states
will
not
look
tamely
on
while
england
emancipates
her
slaves
and
they
inform
us
that
the
inspection
of
the
naval
stations
has
become
a
subject
of
great
importance
since
the
recent
measures
of
the
british
parliament
a
republic
declaring
war
with
a
monarchy
because
she
gave
freedom
to
her
slaves
would
indeed
form
a
beautiful
moral
picture
for
the
admiration
of
the
world
garrison
was
the
first
person
who
dared
to
edit
a
newspaper
in
which
slavery
was
spoken
of
as
altogether
wicked
and
inexcusable
for
this
crime
the
legislature
of
georgia
have
offered
five
thousand
dollars
to
any
one
who
will
arrest
and
prosecute
him
to
conviction
the
laws
of
that
an
association
of
gentlemen
in
south
carolina
have
likewise
offered
a
large
reward
for
the
same
object
it
is
to
say
the
least
a
very
remarkable
step
for
one
state
in
this
union
to
promulgate
such
a
law
concerning
a
citizen
of
another
state
merely
for
publishing
his
opinions
boldly
the
disciples
of
fanny
wright
promulgate
the
most
zealous
and
virulent
attacks
upon
christianity
without
any
hindrance
from
the
civil
authorities
and
this
is
done
upon
the
truly
rational
ground
that
individual
freedom
of
opinion
ought
to
be
respected
that
what
is
false
can
not
stand
and
what
is
true
can
not
be
overthrown
we
leave
christianity
to
take
care
of
itself
but
slavery
is
a
delicate
subject
and
whoever
attacks
that
must
be
punished
garrison
is
a
disinterested
intelligent
and
remarkably
man
whose
only
fault
is
that
he
can
not
be
moderate
on
a
subject
which
it
is
exceedingly
difficult
for
an
honest
mind
to
examine
with
calmness
many
who
highly
respect
his
character
and
motives
regret
his
tendency
to
use
wholesale
and
unqualified
expressions
but
it
is
something
to
have
the
truth
told
even
if
it
be
not
in
the
mildest
way
where
an
evil
is
powerfully
supported
by
the
and
prejudice
of
the
community
none
but
an
ardent
individual
will
venture
to
meddle
with
it
luther
was
deemed
indiscreet
even
by
those
who
liked
him
best
yet
a
more
prudent
man
would
never
have
given
an
impetus
sufficiently
powerful
to
heave
the
great
mass
of
corruption
under
which
the
church
was
buried
garrison
has
certainly
the
merit
of
having
first
called
public
attention
to
a
neglected
and
very
important
subject
al
i
believe
whoever
fairly
and
dispassionately
examines
the
question
will
be
more
than
disposed
to
forgive
the
occasional
faults
of
an
ardent
temperament
in
consideration
of
the
difficulty
of
the
undertaking
and
the
violence
with
which
it
has
been
opposed
footnote
al
this
remark
is
not
intended
to
indicate
want
of
respect
for
the
early
exertions
of
the
friends
in
their
numerous
manumission
societies
or
for
the
efforts
of
that
staunch
fearless
friend
of
freedom
benjamin
lundy
but
garrison
was
the
first
that
boldly
attacked
slavery
as
a
sin
and
colonization
as
its
twin
sister
the
palliator
of
slavery
assures
the
abolitionists
that
their
benevolence
is
perfectly
quixotic
that
the
negroes
are
happy
and
contented
and
have
no
desire
to
change
their
lot
an
answer
to
this
may
as
i
have
already
said
be
found
in
the
judicial
reports
of
slaveholding
states
in
the
vigilance
of
their
laws
in
advertisements
for
runaway
slaves
and
in
the
details
of
their
own
newspapers
the
west
india
planters
make
the
same
protestations
concerning
the
happiness
of
their
slaves
yet
the
cruelties
proved
by
undoubted
and
unanswerable
testimony
are
enough
to
sicken
the
heart
it
is
said
that
slavery
is
a
great
deal
worse
in
the
west
indies
than
in
the
united
states
but
i
believe
precisely
the
reverse
of
this
proposition
has
been
true
within
late
years
for
the
english
government
have
been
earnestly
trying
to
atone
for
their
guilt
by
the
introduction
of
laws
expressly
framed
to
guard
the
weak
and
defenceless
a
gentleman
who
has
been
a
great
deal
among
the
planters
of
both
countries
and
who
is
by
no
means
favorable
to
gives
it
as
his
decided
opinion
that
the
slaves
are
better
off
in
the
west
indies
than
they
are
in
the
united
states
it
is
true
we
hear
a
great
deal
more
about
west
indian
cruelty
than
we
do
about
our
own
english
books
and
periodicals
are
continually
full
of
the
subject
and
even
in
the
colonies
newspapers
openly
denounce
the
hateful
system
and
take
every
opportunity
to
prove
the
amount
of
wretchedness
it
produces
in
this
country
we
have
not
until
very
recently
dared
to
publish
any
thing
upon
the
subject
our
books
our
reviews
our
newspapers
our
almanacs
have
all
been
silent
or
exerted
their
influence
on
the
wrong
side
the
negro
crimes
are
repeated
but
his
sufferings
are
never
told
even
in
our
geographies
it
is
taught
that
the
colored
race
always
be
degraded
now
and
then
anecdotes
of
cruelties
committed
in
the
slaveholding
states
are
told
by
individuals
who
witnessed
them
but
they
are
almost
always
afraid
to
give
their
names
to
the
public
because
the
southerners
will
call
them
a
disgrace
to
the
soil
and
the
northerners
will
echo
the
sentiment
the
promptitude
and
earnestness
with
which
has
aided
the
slaveholders
in
repressing
all
discussions
which
they
were
desirous
to
avoid
has
called
forth
many
expressions
of
gratitude
in
their
public
speeches
and
private
conversation
and
truly
we
have
well
earned
randolph
favorite
appellation
the
white
slaves
of
the
north
by
our
tameness
and
servility
with
regard
to
a
subject
where
good
feeling
and
good
principle
alike
demand
a
firm
and
independent
spirit
we
are
told
that
the
southerners
will
of
themselves
do
away
slavery
and
they
alone
understand
how
to
do
it
but
it
is
an
obvious
fact
that
all
their
measures
have
tended
to
perpetuate
the
system
and
even
if
we
have
the
fullest
faith
that
they
mean
to
do
their
duty
the
belief
by
no
means
absolves
us
from
doing
ours
the
evil
is
gigantic
and
its
removal
requires
every
heart
and
head
in
the
community
it
is
said
that
our
sympathies
ought
to
be
given
to
the
masters
who
are
abundantly
more
to
be
pitied
than
the
slaves
if
this
be
the
case
the
planters
are
singularly
disinterested
not
to
change
places
with
their
bondmen
our
sympathies
been
given
to
the
masters
and
to
those
masters
who
seemed
most
desirous
to
remain
for
ever
in
their
pitiable
condition
there
are
hearts
at
the
south
sincerely
desirous
of
doing
right
in
this
cause
but
their
generous
impulses
are
checked
by
the
laws
of
their
respective
states
and
the
strong
disapprobation
of
their
neighbors
i
know
a
lady
in
georgia
who
would
i
believe
make
any
personal
sacrifice
to
instruct
her
slaves
and
give
them
freedom
but
if
she
were
found
guilty
of
teaching
the
alphabet
or
manumitting
her
slaves
fines
and
imprisonment
would
be
the
consequence
if
she
sold
them
they
would
be
likely
to
fall
into
hands
less
merciful
than
her
own
of
such
we
can
not
speak
with
too
much
respect
and
tenderness
they
are
comparatively
few
in
number
and
stand
in
a
most
perplexing
situation
it
is
a
duty
to
give
all
our
sympathy
to
it
is
mere
mockery
to
say
what
is
so
often
said
that
the
southerners
as
a
body
really
wish
to
abolish
slavery
if
they
wished
it
they
certainly
would
make
the
attempt
when
the
majority
heartily
desire
a
change
it
is
effected
be
the
difficulties
what
they
may
the
americans
are
peculiarly
responsible
for
the
example
they
give
for
in
no
other
country
does
the
unchecked
voice
of
the
people
constitute
the
whole
of
government
we
must
not
be
induced
to
excuse
slavery
by
the
plausible
argument
that
england
introduced
it
among
us
the
wickedness
of
beginning
such
a
work
unquestionably
belongs
to
her
the
sin
of
continuing
it
is
certainly
our
own
it
is
true
that
virginia
while
a
province
did
petition
the
british
government
to
check
the
introduction
of
slaves
into
the
colonies
and
their
refusal
to
do
so
was
afterward
enumerated
among
the
public
reasons
for
separating
from
the
mother
country
but
it
is
equally
true
that
when
we
became
independent
the
southern
states
stipulated
that
the
should
not
be
abolished
by
law
until
the
strongest
and
best
reason
that
can
be
given
for
our
supineness
on
the
subject
of
slavery
is
the
fear
of
dissolving
the
union
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
demands
our
highest
reverence
those
who
approve
and
those
who
disapprove
of
particular
portions
are
equally
bound
to
yield
implicit
obedience
to
its
authority
but
we
must
not
forget
that
the
constitution
provides
for
any
change
that
may
be
required
for
the
general
good
the
great
machine
is
constructed
with
a
by
which
any
rapidly
increasing
evil
may
be
expelled
whenever
the
people
desire
it
if
the
southern
politicians
are
determined
to
make
a
siamese
question
of
this
also
if
they
insist
that
the
union
shall
not
exist
without
slavery
it
can
only
be
said
that
they
join
two
things
which
have
no
affinity
with
each
other
and
which
can
not
permanently
exist
together
they
chain
the
living
and
vigorous
to
the
diseased
and
dying
and
the
former
will
assuredly
perish
in
the
infected
neighborhood
the
universal
introduction
of
free
labor
is
the
surest
way
to
consolidate
the
union
and
enable
us
to
live
together
in
harmony
and
peace
if
a
history
is
ever
written
entitled
the
decay
and
dissolution
of
the
north
american
republic
its
author
will
distinctly
trace
our
downfall
to
the
existence
of
slavery
among
us
there
is
hardly
any
thing
bad
in
politics
or
religion
that
has
not
been
sanctioned
or
tolerated
by
a
suffering
community
because
certain
powerful
individuals
were
able
to
identify
the
evil
with
some
other
principle
long
consecrated
to
the
hearts
and
consciences
of
men
under
all
circumstances
there
is
but
one
honest
course
and
that
is
to
do
right
and
trust
the
consequences
to
divine
providence
duties
are
ours
events
are
god
policy
with
all
her
cunning
can
devise
no
rule
so
safe
salutary
and
effective
as
this
simple
maxim
we
can
not
too
cautiously
examine
arguments
and
excuses
brought
forward
by
those
whose
interest
or
convenience
is
connected
with
keeping
their
in
a
state
of
ignorance
and
brutality
and
such
we
shall
find
in
abundance
at
the
north
as
well
as
the
south
i
have
heard
the
abolition
of
slavery
condemned
on
the
ground
that
vessels
would
not
be
employed
to
export
the
produce
of
the
south
if
they
had
free
laborers
of
their
own
this
objection
is
so
utterly
bad
in
its
spirit
that
it
hardly
deserves
an
answer
assuredly
it
is
a
righteous
plan
to
retard
the
progress
of
liberal
principles
and
keep
human
nature
for
ever
in
the
stocks
that
some
individuals
may
make
a
few
hundred
dollars
more
per
annum
besides
the
experience
of
the
world
abundantly
proves
that
all
such
forced
expedients
are
unwise
the
increased
prosperity
of
one
country
or
of
one
section
of
a
country
always
contributes
in
some
form
or
other
to
the
prosperity
of
other
states
to
love
our
neighbor
as
ourselves
is
after
all
the
shrewdest
way
of
doing
business
in
england
the
abolition
of
the
was
long
and
stoutly
resisted
in
the
same
spirit
and
by
the
same
arguments
that
characterize
the
defence
of
the
here
but
it
would
now
be
difficult
to
find
a
man
so
reckless
that
he
would
not
be
ashamed
of
being
called
a
public
opinion
has
nearly
conquered
one
evil
and
if
rightly
directed
it
will
ultimately
subdue
the
other
is
it
asked
what
can
be
done
i
answer
much
very
much
can
be
effected
if
each
individual
will
try
to
deserve
the
commendation
bestowed
by
our
saviour
on
the
woman
of
old
she
hath
done
what
she
could
the
friends
always
remarkable
for
fearless
obedience
to
the
inward
light
of
conscience
early
gave
an
example
worthy
of
being
followed
at
their
annual
meeting
in
pennsylvania
in
many
individuals
urged
the
incompatibility
of
slavery
and
christianity
and
their
zeal
continued
until
in
all
quakers
who
bought
or
sold
a
slave
or
refused
to
emancipate
those
they
already
owned
were
excluded
from
communion
with
the
society
had
it
not
been
for
the
early
exertions
of
these
excellent
people
the
fair
and
flourishing
state
of
pennsylvania
might
now
perchance
be
withering
under
the
effects
of
slavery
to
this
day
the
society
of
friends
both
in
england
and
america
omit
no
opportunity
public
or
private
of
discountenancing
this
bad
system
and
the
methodists
at
least
in
england
have
earnestly
labored
in
the
same
glorious
cause
the
famous
anthony
benezet
a
quaker
in
philadelphia
has
left
us
a
noble
example
of
what
may
be
done
for
conscience
sake
being
a
teacher
he
took
effectual
care
that
his
scholars
should
have
ample
knowledge
and
christian
impressions
concerning
the
nature
of
slavery
he
caused
articles
to
be
inserted
in
the
almanacs
likely
to
arrest
public
attention
upon
the
subject
he
talked
about
it
and
wrote
letters
about
it
he
published
and
distributed
tracts
at
his
own
expense
if
any
person
was
going
a
journey
his
first
thought
was
how
he
could
make
him
instrumental
in
favor
of
his
benevolent
purposes
he
addressed
a
petition
to
the
queen
for
the
suppression
of
the
and
another
to
the
good
countess
of
huntingdon
beseeching
that
the
rice
and
indigo
plantations
belonging
to
the
which
she
had
endowed
near
savannah
in
georgia
might
not
be
cultivated
by
those
who
encouraged
the
he
took
care
to
increase
the
comforts
and
elevate
the
character
of
the
colored
people
within
his
influence
he
zealously
promoted
the
establishment
of
an
african
school
and
devoted
much
of
the
two
last
years
of
his
life
to
personal
attendance
upon
his
pupils
by
fifty
years
of
constant
industry
he
had
amassed
a
small
fortune
and
this
was
left
after
the
decease
of
his
widow
to
the
support
of
the
african
school
similar
exertions
though
on
a
less
extensive
scale
were
made
by
the
late
excellent
john
kenrick
of
newton
mass
for
more
than
thirty
years
the
constant
object
of
his
thoughts
and
the
chief
purpose
of
his
life
was
the
abolition
of
slavery
his
earnest
conversation
aroused
many
other
minds
to
think
and
act
upon
the
subject
he
wrote
letters
inserted
articles
in
the
newspapers
gave
liberal
donations
and
circulated
pamphlets
at
his
own
expense
cowper
contributed
much
to
the
cause
when
he
wrote
the
complaint
and
thus
excited
the
compassion
of
his
numerous
readers
wedgewood
aided
the
work
when
he
caused
cameos
to
be
struck
representing
a
kneeling
african
in
chains
and
thus
made
even
capricious
fashion
an
avenue
to
the
heart
clarkson

patient
investigation
of
evidence
and
fox
and
wilberforce

speeches
mungo
park
gave
his
powerful
influence
by
the
kind
and
liberal
manner
in
which
he
always
represented
the
africans
the
duchess
of
devonshire
wrote
verses
and
caused
them
to
be
set
to
music
and
wherever
those
lines
were
sung
some
hearts
were
touched
in
favor
of
the
oppressed
this
fascinating
woman
made
even
her
beauty
serve
in
the
cause
of
benevolence
fox
was
returned
for
parliament
through
her
influence
and
she
is
said
to
have
procured
more
than
one
vote
by
allowing
the
yeomanry
of
england
to
kiss
her
beautiful
cheek
all
are
not
able
to
do
so
much
as
anthony
benezet
and
john
kenrick
have
done
but
we
can
all
do
something
we
can
speak
kindly
and
respectfully
of
colored
people
upon
all
occasions
we
can
repeat
to
our
children
such
traits
as
are
honorable
in
their
character
and
history
we
can
avoid
making
odious
caricatures
of
negroes
we
can
teach
boys
that
it
is
unmanly
and
contemptible
to
insult
an
unfortunate
class
of
people
by
the
vulgar
outcry
of
nigger
nigger
even
mahmoud
of
turkey
rivals
us
in
liberality
for
he
long
ago
ordered
a
fine
to
be
levied
upon
those
who
called
a
christian
a
dog
and
in
his
dominions
the
is
so
great
that
a
christian
must
be
a
degraded
being
a
residence
in
turkey
might
be
profitable
to
those
christians
who
patronize
the
eternity
of
prejudice
it
would
afford
an
opportunity
of
testing
the
goodness
of
the
rule
by
showing
how
it
works
both
ways
if
we
are
not
able
to
contribute
to
african
schools
or
do
not
choose
to
do
so
we
can
at
least
refrain
from
opposing
them
if
it
be
disagreeable
to
allow
colored
people
the
same
rights
and
privileges
as
other
citizens
we
can
do
with
our
prejudice
what
most
of
us
often
do
with
better
feeling
we
can
conceal
it
our
almanacs
and
newspapers
can
fairly
show
both
sides
of
the
question
and
if
they
lean
to
either
party
let
it
not
be
to
the
strongest
our
preachers
can
speak
of
slavery
as
they
do
of
other
evils
our
poets
can
find
in
this
subject
abundant
room
for
sentiment
and
pathos
our
orators
provided
they
do
not
want
office
may
venture
an
allusion
to
our
glorious
institutions
the
union
of
individual
influence
produces
a
vast
amount
of
moral
force
which
is
not
the
less
powerful
because
it
is
often
unperceived
a
mere
change
in
the
of
our
efforts
without
any
increased
exertion
would
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
produce
an
entire
revolution
of
public
feeling
this
slow
but
sure
way
of
doing
good
is
almost
the
only
means
by
which
benevolence
can
effect
its
purpose
petitions
have
been
addressed
to
the
english
parliament
on
the
subject
of
slavery
and
a
large
number
of
them
were
signed
by
women
the
same
steps
here
would
be
with
one
exception
useless
and
injudicious
because
the
general
government
has
no
control
over
the
legislatures
of
individual
states
but
the
district
of
columbia
forms
an
exception
to
this
rule
the
united
states
have
power
to
abolish
slavery
and
it
is
the
duty
of
the
citizens
to
petition
year
after
year
until
a
reformation
is
effected
but
who
will
present
remonstrances
against
slavery
the
hon
john
adams
was
intrusted
with
fifteen
petitions
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
district
of
columbia
yet
clearly
as
that
gentleman
sees
and
defines
the
pernicious
effects
of
the
system
he
offered
the
petitions
only
to
protest
against
them
another
petition
to
the
same
effect
intrusted
to
another
massachusetts
representative
was
never
noticed
at
all
brutus
is
an
honorable
man
so
are
they
all
all
honorable
men
nevertheless
there
is
in
this
popular
government
a
subject
on
which
it
is
for
the
people
to
make
themselves
heard
by
publishing
this
book
i
have
put
my
mite
into
the
treasury
the
expectation
of
displeasing
all
classes
has
not
been
unaccompanied
with
pain
but
it
has
been
strongly
impressed
upon
my
mind
that
it
was
a
duty
to
fulfil
this
task
and
worldly
considerations
should
never
