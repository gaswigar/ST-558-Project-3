introduction
i
leibniz
was
above
all
things
a
metaphysician
that
does
not
mean
that
his
head
was
in
the
clouds
or
that
the
particular
sciences
lacked
interest
for
him
not
at
all
he
felt
a
lively
concern
for
theological
debate
he
was
a
mathematician
of
the
first
rank
he
made
original
contributions
to
physics
he
gave
a
realistic
attention
to
moral
psychology
but
he
was
incapable
of
looking
at
the
objects
of
any
special
enquiry
without
seeing
them
as
aspects
or
parts
of
one
intelligible
universe
he
strove
constantly
after
system
and
the
instrument
on
which
his
effort
relied
was
the
speculative
reason
he
embodied
in
an
extreme
form
the
spirit
of
his
age
nothing
could
be
less
like
the
spirit
of
ours
to
many
people
now
alive
metaphysics
means
a
body
of
wild
and
meaningless
assertions
resting
on
spurious
argument
a
professor
of
metaphysics
may
nowadays
be
held
to
deal
handsomely
with
the
duties
of
his
chair
if
he
is
prepared
to
handle
metaphysical
statements
at
all
though
it
be
only
for
the
purpose
of
getting
rid
of
them
by
showing
them
up
as
confused
forms
of
something
else
a
chair
in
metaphysical
philosophy
becomes
analogous
to
a
chair
in
tropical
diseases
what
is
taught
from
it
is
not
the
propagation
but
the
cure
confidence
in
metaphysical
construction
has
ebbed
and
flowed
through
philosophical
history
periods
of
speculation
have
been
followed
by
periods
of
criticism
the
tide
will
flow
again
but
it
has
not
turned
yet
and
such
metaphysicians
as
survive
scarcely
venture
further
than
to
argue
a
case
for
the
possibility
of
their
art
it
would
be
an
embarrassing
task
to
open
an
approach
to
leibnitian
metaphysics
from
the
present
metaphysical
position
if
there
is
a
present
position
if
we
want
an
agreed
it
will
have
to
be
historical
the
historical
importance
of
leibniz
ideas
is
anyhow
unmistakable
if
metaphysical
thinking
is
nonsensical
its
empire
over
the
human
imagination
must
still
be
confessed
if
it
is
as
chimerical
a
science
as
alchemy
it
is
no
less
fertile
in
of
importance
and
if
we
are
to
consider
leibniz
historically
we
can
not
do
better
than
take
up
his
for
two
reasons
it
was
the
only
one
of
his
main
philosophical
works
to
be
published
in
his
lifetime
so
that
it
was
a
principal
means
of
his
direct
influence
the
leibniz
his
own
age
knew
was
the
leibniz
of
the
then
in
the
second
place
the
itself
is
peculiarly
rich
in
historical
material
it
reflects
the
world
of
men
and
books
which
leibniz
knew
it
expresses
the
theological
setting
of
metaphysical
speculation
which
still
predominated
in
the
first
years
of
the
eighteenth
century
leibniz
is
remembered
for
his
philosophy
he
was
not
a
professional
philosopher
he
was
offered
academic
chairs
but
he
declined
them
he
was
a
gentleman
a
person
of
means
librarian
to
a
reigning
prince
and
frequently
employed
in
state
affairs
of
trust
and
importance
the
librarian
might
at
any
moment
become
the
political
secretary
and
offer
his
own
contributions
to
policy
leibniz
was
for
the
greater
part
of
his
active
life
the
learned
and
confidential
servant
of
the
house
of
brunswick
when
the
duke
had
nothing
better
to
do
with
him
he
set
him
to
research
into
ducal
history
if
leibniz
had
a
profession
in
literature
it
was
history
rather
than
philosophy
he
was
even
more
closely
bound
to
the
interests
of
his
prince
than
john
locke
was
to
those
of
the
prince
of
orange
the
houses
of
orange
and
of
brunswick
were
on
the
same
side
in
the
principal
contest
which
divided
europe
the
battle
between
louis
xiv
and
his
enemies
it
was
a
of
the
struggle
when
the
prince
of
orange
supplanted
louis
stuart
friends
on
the
english
throne
it
was
a
continuation
of
the
same
movement
when
leibniz
master
george
i
succeeded
to
the
same
throne
and
frustrated
the
restoration
of
the
stuart
heir
locke
returned
to
england
in
the
wake
of
the
prince
of
orange
and
became
the
representative
thinker
of
the
régime
leibniz
wished
to
come
to
the
english
court
of
george
i
but
was
unkindly
ordered
to
attend
to
the
duties
of
his
librarianship
so
he
remained
in
hanover
he
was
then
an
old
man
and
before
the
tide
of
favour
had
turned
he
died
posterity
has
reckoned
locke
and
leibniz
the
heads
of
rival
sects
but
politically
they
were
on
the
same
side
as
against
louis
political
absolutism
and
enforced
religious
uniformity
both
championed
religious
toleration
and
the
freedom
of
the
mind
their
theological
liberalism
was
political
prudence
it
was
not
necessarily
for
that
reason
the
less
personally
sincere
they
had
too
much
wisdom
to
meet
bigotry
with
bigotry
or
set
protestant
intolerance
against
catholic
absolutism
but
they
had
too
much
sympathy
with
the
spirit
of
europe
to
react
into
free
thinking
or
to
make
a
frontal
attack
on
revealed
truth
they
took
their
stand
on
a
fundamental
christian
theism
the
common
religion
of
all
good
men
they
repudiated
the
negative
enormities
of
hobbes
and
spinoza
the
christian
was
to
hold
a
position
covered
by
three
lines
of
defences
the
base
line
was
to
be
the
substance
of
christian
theism
and
of
christian
morals
and
it
was
to
be
held
by
the
forces
of
sheer
reason
without
aid
from
scriptural
revelation
the
middle
line
was
laid
down
by
the
general
sense
of
scripture
and
the
defence
of
it
was
this
doctrine
is
reconcilable
with
the
findings
of
sheer
reason
but
it
goes
beyond
them
we
believe
the
scriptures
because
they
are
authenticated
by
marks
of
supernatural
intervention
in
the
circumstances
of
their
origin
we
believe
them
but
reason
controls
our
interpretation
of
them
there
remained
the
most
forward
and
the
most
hazardous
line
the
special
positions
which
a
church
a
sect
or
an
individual
might
found
upon
the
scriptural
revelation
a
prudent
man
would
not
hold
his
advance
positions
in
the
same
force
or
defend
them
with
the
same
obstinacy
as
either
of
the
lines
behind
them
he
could
argue
for
them
but
he
could
not
require
assent
to
them
one
can
not
help
feeling
indeed
the
readiness
of
these
writers
to
fall
back
not
only
from
the
front
line
to
the
middle
line
but
from
the
middle
line
itself
to
the
base
line
leibniz
for
example
writes
with
perfect
seriousness
and
decency
about
the
christian
scheme
of
redemption
but
it
hardly
looks
like
being
for
him
a
crucial
deliverance
from
perdition
it
is
not
the
intervention
of
mercy
by
which
alone
he
possesses
himself
of
us
it
is
one
of
the
ways
in
which
supreme
benevolence
carries
out
a
cosmic
policy
and
god
benevolence
is
known
by
pure
reason
and
apart
from
christian
revelation
in
one
politically
important
particular
the
theological
attitude
of
leibniz
differed
from
that
of
locke
both
stood
for
toleration
and
for
the
minimizing
of
the
differences
between
the
sects
this
was
a
serious
enough
matter
in
england
but
it
was
an
even
more
serious
matter
in
germany
for
germany
was
divided
between
catholics
and
protestants
effective
toleration
must
embrace
them
both
english
toleration
might
indulge
a
harmless
catholic
minority
while
rejecting
the
catholic
régime
as
the
embodiment
of
intolerance
but
this
was
not
practical
politics
on
the
continent
you
must
tolerate
catholicism
on
an
equal
footing
and
come
to
terms
with
catholic
régimes
leibniz
was
not
going
to
damn
the
pope
with
true
protestant
fervour
it
was
his
consistent
aim
to
show
that
his
theological
principles
were
as
serviceable
to
catholic
thinkers
as
to
the
doctors
of
his
own
church
on
some
points
indeed
he
found
his
most
solid
support
from
catholics
in
other
places
there
are
hints
of
a
joint
front
against
calvinism
but
on
the
whole
leibniz
writings
suggest
that
the
important
decisions
cut
across
all
the
churches
and
not
between
them
leibniz
was
impelled
to
a
compromise
with
not
only
by
the
religious
divisions
of
germany
but
at
one
stage
by
the
political
weakness
of
the
german
protestant
states
at
the
point
of
louis
highest
success
the
protestant
princes
had
no
hope
but
in
catholic
austria
and
austria
was
distracted
by
turkish
pressure
in
the
rear
leibniz
hoped
to
relieve
the
situation
by
preaching
a
crusade
could
not
the
christian
princes
sink
their
differences
and
unite
against
the
infidel
and
could
not
the
christian
alliance
be
cemented
by
theological
agreement
hence
leibniz
famous
negotiation
with
bossuet
for
a
basis
of
concord
it
was
plainly
destined
to
fail
and
it
was
bound
to
recoil
upon
its
author
how
could
he
be
a
true
protestant
who
treated
the
differences
with
the
catholics
as
how
could
he
have
touched
pitch
and
taken
no
defilement
leibniz
was
generally
admired
but
he
was
not
widely
trusted
as
a
mere
politician
he
may
be
judged
to
have
himself
it
has
been
the
object
of
the
preceding
paragraphs
to
show
that
leibniz
the
politician
and
leibniz
the
theologian
were
one
and
the
same
person
not
at
all
to
suggest
that
his
rational
theology
was
just
political
expediency
we
may
apply
to
him
a
parody
of
his
own
doctrine
the
harmony
between
nature
and
grace
everything
happens
as
though
leibniz
were
a
liberal
politician
and
his
theology
expressed
his
politics
yes
but
equally
everything
happens
as
though
leibniz
were
a
philosophical
theologian
and
his
politics
expressed
his
theology
his
appreciation
of
catholic
speculation
was
natural
and
sincere
his
dogmatic
ancestry
is
to
be
looked
for
in
thomism
and
catholic
humanism
as
much
as
anywhere
above
all
he
had
himself
a
liberal
and
generous
mind
it
gave
him
pleasure
to
appreciate
good
wherever
he
could
see
it
and
to
discover
a
soul
of
truth
in
every
opinion
from
the
moment
when
leibniz
became
aware
of
himself
as
an
independent
thinker
he
was
the
man
of
a
doctrine
sometimes
he
called
it
principles
sometimes
new
system
sometimes
harmony
it
could
be
quite
briefly
expressed
he
was
always
ready
to
oblige
his
friends
with
a
summary
statement
either
in
a
letter
or
an
enclosed
memorandum
and
several
such
have
come
down
to
us
the
doctrine
may
have
been
in
leibniz
view
simple
but
it
was
applicable
to
every
department
of
human
speculation
or
enquiry
it
provided
a
new
alphabet
of
philosophical
ideas
and
everything
in
heaven
and
earth
could
be
expressed
in
it
not
only
could
be
but
ought
to
be
and
leibniz
showed
tireless
energy
in
working
out
restatements
of
standing
problems
as
a
man
with
an
idea
with
a
philosophical
nostrum
leibniz
may
be
compared
to
bishop
berkeley
there
was
never
any
more
doubt
that
leibniz
was
a
leibnitian
than
that
berkeley
was
a
berkeleian
but
there
is
no
comparison
between
the
two
men
in
the
width
of
their
range
about
many
things
berkeley
never
took
the
trouble
to
berkeleianize
to
take
the
most
surprising
instance
of
his
neglect
he
assured
the
world
that
his
whole
doctrine
pointed
to
and
hung
upon
theology
but
what
sort
of
a
theology
he
scarcely
took
the
first
steps
in
the
formulation
of
it
he
preferred
to
keep
on
defending
and
explaining
his
est
with
leibniz
it
is
wholly
different
he
carries
his
new
torch
into
every
corner
to
illuminate
the
dark
questions
the
wide
applicability
of
harmony
might
come
home
to
its
inventor
as
a
rich
surprise
the
reflective
historian
will
find
it
less
surprising
for
he
will
suspect
that
the
applications
were
in
view
from
the
start
what
was
leibniz
thinking
of
when
the
new
principle
flashed
upon
him
what
was
he
thinking
of
he
had
a
mind
if
the
origins
of
the
principle
were
complex
little
wonder
that
its
applications
were
manifold
every
expositor
of
leibniz
who
does
not
wish
to
be
endlessly
tedious
must
concentrate
attention
on
one
aspect
of
leibniz
principle
and
one
source
of
its
origin
we
will
here
give
an
account
of
the
matter
which
we
trust
will
go
most
directly
to
the
heart
of
it
but
we
will
make
no
claims
to
sufficient
interpretation
of
leibniz
leibniz
then
like
all
the
philosophers
of
the
seventeenth
century
was
reforming
scholasticism
in
the
light
of
a
new
physical
science
the
science
was
mathematical
in
its
form
mechanistical
in
its
doctrine
and
unanswerable
in
its
evidence
it
got
results
but
it
was
metaphysically
intractable
and
the
doctrines
of
infinite
and
finite
substance
which
it
generated
furnish
a
gallery
of
metaphysical
grotesques
unless
we
are
to
except
leibniz
his
system
is
if
nothing
else
a
miracle
of
ingenuity
and
there
are
moments
when
we
are
in
danger
of
believing
it
it
is
a
natural
mistake
for
the
student
of
thought
to
underestimate
the
tenacity
of
scholastic
aristotelianism
descartes
we
all
know
was
reared
in
it
but
then
descartes
overthrew
it
and
he
had
done
his
work
and
died
by
the
time
that
leibniz
was
of
an
age
to
philosophize
at
all
we
expect
to
see
leibniz
starting
on
his
shoulders
and
climbing
on
from
there
we
are
disappointed
leibniz
himself
tells
us
that
he
was
raised
in
the
scholastic
teaching
his
acquaintance
with
opinions
was
and
they
were
retailed
to
him
only
that
they
might
be
derided
he
agreed
like
an
amiable
youth
with
his
preceptors
the
next
phase
of
his
development
gave
him
a
direct
knowledge
of
cartesian
writings
and
of
other
modern
books
beside
such
as
those
of
the
atomist
gassendi
he
was
delighted
with
what
he
read
because
of
its
fertility
in
the
field
of
physics
and
mathematics
and
for
a
short
time
he
was
an
enthusiastic
modern
but
presently
he
became
dissatisfied
the
new
systems
did
not
go
far
enough
they
were
still
scientifically
inadequate
at
the
same
time
they
went
too
far
and
carried
metaphysical
paradox
beyond
the
limits
of
human
credulity
there
is
no
mystery
about
leibniz
scientific
objections
to
the
new
philosophers
if
he
condemned
them
here
it
was
on
the
basis
of
scientific
thought
and
observation
descartes
formulation
of
the
laws
of
motion
could
for
example
be
refuted
by
physical
experiment
and
if
his
general
view
of
physical
nature
was
bound
up
with
it
then
so
much
the
worse
for
the
cartesian
philosophy
but
whence
came
leibniz
more
strictly
metaphysical
objections
where
had
he
learned
that
standard
of
metaphysical
adequacy
which
showed
up
the
inadequacy
of
the
new
metaphysicians
his
own
disciples
might
be
satisfied
to
reply
that
he
learnt
it
from
reason
herself
but
the
answer
will
not
pass
with
us
leibniz
reasoned
indeed
but
he
did
not
reason
from
nowhere
nor
would
he
have
got
anywhere
if
he
had
his
conception
of
metaphysical
reason
was
what
his
early
scholastic
training
had
made
it
there
are
certain
absurd
opinions
which
we
are
sure
we
have
been
taught
although
when
put
to
it
we
find
it
hard
to
name
the
teacher
among
them
is
something
of
this
sort
was
a
scholarly
and
sympathetic
thinker
he
had
more
sense
of
history
than
his
contemporaries
and
he
was
instinctively
eclectic
he
believed
he
could
learn
something
from
each
of
his
great
predecessors
we
see
him
reaching
back
to
cull
a
notion
from
plato
or
from
aristotle
he
even
found
something
of
use
in
the
scholastics
in
particular
he
picked
out
the
aristotelian
entelechy
to
stop
a
gap
in
the
philosophy
of
his
own
age
what
this
form
of
statement
ignores
is
that
leibniz
a
scholastic
a
scholastic
endeavouring
like
descartes
before
him
to
revolutionize
scholasticism
the
word
was
indeed
a
piece
of
antiquity
which
leibniz
revived
but
the
thing
for
which
it
stood
was
the
most
familiar
of
current
scholastic
conceptions
means
active
principle
of
wholeness
or
completion
in
an
individual
thing
scholasticism
was
content
to
talk
about
it
under
the
name
of
form
or
cause
but
the
scholastic
interpretation
of
the
idea
was
hopelessly
discredited
by
the
new
science
and
the
scholastic
terms
shared
the
discredit
of
scholastic
doctrine
leibniz
wanted
a
term
with
a
more
general
sound
is
an
he
wanted
to
say
scholasticism
has
defined
as
substantial
form
but
i
am
going
to
give
a
new
definition
of
it
entelechy
was
a
useful
name
for
the
more
so
as
it
had
the
authority
of
aristotle
the
master
of
scholasticism
under
the
name
of
entelechy
leibniz
was
upholding
the
soul
of
scholastic
doctrine
while
retrenching
the
limbs
and
outward
flourishes
the
doctrine
of
substantial
form
which
he
learnt
in
his
youth
had
had
in
it
he
could
not
settle
down
in
the
principles
of
descartes
or
of
gassendi
because
both
ignored
this
vital
since
the
requirements
of
a
new
science
would
not
allow
a
return
to
sheer
scholasticism
it
was
necessary
to
find
a
fresh
philosophy
in
which
entelechy
and
mechanism
might
be
accommodated
side
by
side
if
one
had
asked
any
of
the
seventeenth
century
to
name
the
doctrine
he
most
abominated
he
would
most
likely
have
replied
form
let
us
recall
what
was
rejected
under
this
name
and
why
the
medieval
account
of
physical
nature
had
been
dominated
by
what
we
may
call
biology
biology
indeed
is
the
science
of
the
living
and
the
medievals
were
no
more
inclined
than
we
are
to
endow
all
physical
bodies
with
life
what
they
did
do
was
to
take
living
bodies
as
typical
and
to
treat
other
bodies
as
imperfectly
analogous
to
them
such
an
approach
was
reasonable
enough
for
we
may
be
expected
to
know
best
the
physical
being
closest
to
our
own
and
we
at
any
rate
are
alive
why
not
argue
from
the
better
known
to
the
less
known
from
the
nearer
to
the
more
remote
interpreting
other
things
by
the
formula
of
our
own
being
and
allowing
whatever
discount
is
necessary
for
their
degree
of
unlikeness
to
us
biology
reasons
as
follows
in
a
living
body
there
is
a
certain
pattern
of
organized
parts
a
certain
rhythm
of
successive
motions
and
a
certain
range
of
characteristic
activities
the
pattern
the
sheer
anatomy
is
basic
but
it
can
not
long
continue
to
exist
outside
a
refrigerator
without
accompanying
vital
rhythms
in
heart
respiration
and
digestion
nor
do
these
perform
their
parts
without
the
intermittent
support
of
variable
but
still
characteristic
activities
dogs
not
only
breathe
and
digest
they
run
about
hunt
their
food
look
for
mates
bark
at
cats
and
so
on
the
anatomical
pattern
the
vital
rhythm
and
the
characteristic
acts
together
express
dogginess
they
reveal
the
specific
form
of
the
dog
they
it
exactly
what
the
specific
form
was
the
subject
of
much
medieval
speculation
it
need
not
concern
us
here
taking
the
form
of
the
species
for
granted
biology
proceeds
to
ask
how
it
comes
to
be
in
a
given
instance
say
in
the
dog
toby
before
this
dog
was
born
or
thought
of
his
form
or
species
was
displayed
in
each
of
his
parents
and
now
it
looks
as
though
the
form
of
dog
had
detached
itself
from
them
through
the
generative
act
and
set
up
anew
on
its
own
account
how
does
it
do
that
by
getting
hold
of
some
materials
in
which
to
express
itself
at
first
it
takes
them
from
the
body
of
the
mother
afterwards
it
collects
them
from
a
wider
environment
and
what
the
dog
eats
becomes
the
dog
what
then
is
the
relation
of
the
assimilated
materials
to
the
which
assimilates
them
before
assimilation
they
have
their
own
form
before
the
dog
eats
the
leg
of
mutton
it
has
the
form
given
to
it
by
its
place
in
the
body
of
a
sheep
what
happens
to
the
mutton
is
it
without
remainder
transubstantiated
from
sheep
into
dog
it
loses
all
its
distinctively
characteristicsm
but
there
may
be
some
more
basically
material
characteristics
which
it
preserves
they
underlay
the
structure
of
the
mutton
and
they
continue
to
underlie
the
structure
of
the
dog
flesh
which
supplants
it
whatever
these
characteristics
may
be
let
us
call
them
common
material
characteristics
and
let
us
say
that
they
belong
to
or
compose
a
common
material
nature
the
common
material
nature
has
its
own
way
of
existing
and
perhaps
its
own
principles
of
physical
action
we
may
suppose
that
we
know
much
or
that
we
know
little
about
it
this
one
thing
at
least
we
know
that
it
is
capable
of
becoming
alternatively
either
mutton
or
dog
flesh
it
is
not
essential
to
it
to
be
mutton
or
mutton
it
would
always
be
nor
dog
flesh
or
it
would
always
be
dog
flesh
it
is
capable
of
becoming
either
according
as
it
is
captured
by
one
or
other
system
of
formal
organization
so
the
voters
who
are
to
go
to
the
polls
are
by
their
common
nature
englishmen
they
are
essentially
neither
socialist
curs
nor
conservative
sheep
but
intrinsically
capable
of
becoming
either
if
they
become
captured
by
either
system
of
party
organization
according
to
this
way
of
thinking
there
is
a
certain
about
the
relation
of
the
common
material
nature
to
the
higher
forms
of
organization
capable
of
capturing
it
considered
in
itself
alone
it
is
perhaps
to
be
seen
as
governed
by
absolutely
determined
laws
of
its
own
it
is
heavy
then
it
will
fall
unless
obstructed
it
is
solid
then
it
will
resist
intrusions
but
considered
as
material
for
organization
by
higher
forms
it
is
indeterminate
it
acts
in
one
sort
of
way
under
the
persuasion
of
the
and
in
another
sort
of
way
under
the
persuasion
of
the
and
we
can
not
tell
how
it
will
act
until
we
know
which
form
is
going
to
capture
it
no
amount
of
study
bestowed
on
the
common
material
nature
will
enable
us
to
judge
how
it
will
behave
under
the
persuasion
of
the
higher
organizing
form
the
only
way
to
discover
that
is
to
examine
the
higher
form
itself
every
form
then
will
really
be
the
object
of
a
distinct
science
the
form
of
the
sheep
and
the
form
of
the
dog
have
much
in
common
but
that
merely
happens
to
be
so
we
can
not
depend
upon
it
or
risk
inferences
from
sheep
to
dog
we
must
examine
each
in
itself
we
shall
really
need
a
science
of
probatology
about
sheep
and
cynology
about
dogs
again
the
common
material
nature
has
its
own
principles
of
being
and
action
so
it
will
need
a
science
of
itself
which
we
may
call
hylology
each
of
these
sciences
is
mistress
in
her
own
province
but
how
many
there
are
and
how
puzzlingly
they
overlap
so
long
as
we
remain
within
the
province
of
a
single
science
we
may
be
able
to
think
rigorously
everything
will
be
but
as
soon
as
we
consider
between
one
province
and
another
farewell
to
exactitude
everything
will
be
we
can
think
out
hylology
till
we
are
blue
in
the
face
but
we
shall
never
discover
anything
about
the
entry
of
material
elements
into
higher
organizations
or
how
they
behave
when
they
get
there
we
may
form
perfect
definitions
and
descriptions
of
the
form
of
the
dog
as
such
and
still
derive
no
rules
for
telling
what
elements
of
matter
will
enter
into
the
body
of
a
given
dog
or
how
they
will
be
placed
when
they
do
all
we
can
be
sure
of
is
that
the
will
keep
itself
going
in
and
by
means
of
the
material
it
embodies
unless
the
dog
dies
but
what
happens
to
the
matter
in
the
body
of
the
dog
is
to
the
nature
of
the
matter
and
the
use
of
this
matter
rather
than
of
some
other
equally
suitable
is
accidental
to
the
nature
of
the
dog
no
account
of
material
events
can
dispense
with
accidental
relations
altogether
we
must
at
least
recognize
that
there
are
accidental
relations
between
particular
things
accident
in
the
sense
of
brute
fact
had
to
be
acknowledged
even
by
the
tidiest
and
most
dogmatic
atomism
of
the
last
century
that
atomism
must
allow
it
to
be
accidental
in
this
sense
that
the
space
surrounding
any
given
atom
was
occupied
by
other
atoms
in
a
given
manner
it
belonged
neither
to
the
nature
of
space
to
be
occupied
by
just
those
atoms
in
just
those
places
nor
to
the
nature
of
the
atoms
to
be
distributed
just
like
that
over
space
and
so
in
a
certain
sense
the
environment
of
any
atom
was
an
accidental
environment
that
is
the
particular
arrangement
of
the
environment
was
accidental
the
nature
of
the
environment
was
not
accidental
at
all
it
was
proper
to
the
nature
of
the
atom
to
be
in
interaction
with
other
atoms
over
a
spatial
field
and
it
never
encountered
in
the
of
space
any
other
nature
but
its
own
it
was
not
subject
to
the
accident
of
meeting
strange
natures
nor
of
becoming
suddenly
subject
to
strange
or
unequal
laws
of
interaction
all
interactions
being
with
its
own
kind
were
reciprocal
and
obedient
to
a
single
set
of
calculable
laws
but
the
medieval
philosophy
had
asserted
accidental
relations
between
distinct
sorts
of
the
form
of
living
dog
and
the
form
of
dead
matter
for
example
no
one
could
know
what
effect
an
accidental
relation
would
produce
and
all
accidental
relations
between
different
pairs
of
natures
were
different
at
the
most
there
was
analogy
between
them
every
different
nature
had
to
be
separately
observed
and
when
you
had
observed
them
all
you
could
still
simply
write
an
inventory
of
them
you
could
not
hope
to
rationalize
your
body
of
knowledge
let
us
narrow
the
field
and
consider
what
this
doctrine
allows
us
to
know
about
the
wood
of
a
certain
kind
of
tree
we
shall
begin
by
observing
the
impressions
it
makes
on
our
several
senses
and
we
shall
attribute
to
it
a
substantial
form
such
as
naturally
to
give
rise
to
these
impressions
without
perhaps
being
so
rash
as
to
claim
a
knowledge
of
what
this
substantial
form
is
still
we
do
not
know
what
its
capacities
of
physical
action
and
passion
may
be
we
shall
find
them
out
by
observing
it
in
relation
to
different
it
turns
out
to
be
combustible
by
fire
resistant
to
water
tractable
to
the
carpenter
tools
intractable
to
his
digestive
organs
harmless
to
ostriches
nourishing
to
each
of
these
capacities
of
the
wood
is
distinct
we
can
not
relate
them
intelligibly
to
one
another
nor
deduce
them
from
the
assumed
fundamental
we
can
now
see
why
forms
were
the
of
the
philosophers
it
was
because
they
turned
nature
into
an
unmanageable
jungle
in
which
trees
bushes
and
parasites
of
a
thousand
kinds
wildly
interlaced
there
was
nothing
for
it
if
science
was
to
proceed
but
to
clear
the
ground
and
replant
with
spruce
in
rows
to
postulate
a
single
uniform
nature
of
which
there
should
be
a
single
science
now
neither
probatology
nor
cynology
could
hope
to
be
universal
the
world
is
not
all
sheep
nor
all
dog
it
would
have
to
be
hylology
for
the
world
is
in
its
spatial
aspect
all
material
let
us
say
then
that
there
is
one
uniform
material
nature
of
things
and
that
everything
else
consists
in
the
arrangements
of
the
basic
material
nature
as
the
show
of
towers
and
mountains
in
the
sunset
results
simply
from
an
arrangement
of
vapours
and
let
us
suppose
that
the
interactions
of
the
parts
of
matter
are
all
like
those
which
we
can
observe
in
dead
manipulable
bodies
in
mechanism
in
fact
such
was
the
postulate
of
the
new
philosophers
and
it
yielded
them
results
it
yielded
them
results
and
that
was
highly
gratifying
but
what
meanwhile
had
happened
to
those
palpable
facts
of
common
experience
from
which
the
whole
philosophy
of
substantial
forms
had
taken
its
rise
is
the
wholeness
of
a
living
thing
the
mere
resultant
of
the
orderly
operations
of
its
parts
is
a
bee
no
more
essentially
one
than
a
swarm
is
is
the
life
of
a
living
animal
indistinguishable
from
the
rhythm
of
a
going
watch
except
in
degree
of
complication
and
subtlety
of
contrivance
and
if
an
body
say
my
own
is
simply
an
agglomerate
of
minute
interacting
material
units
and
its
wholeness
is
merely
accidental
and
apparent
how
is
my
conscious
mind
to
be
adjusted
to
it
for
my
consciousness
appears
to
identify
itself
with
that
whole
vital
pattern
which
used
to
be
called
the
substantial
form
we
are
now
told
that
the
pattern
is
nothing
real
or
active
but
the
mere
accidental
resultant
of
distinct
interacting
forces
it
does
no
work
it
exercises
no
influence
or
control
it
nothing
how
then
can
it
be
the
vehicle
and
instrument
of
my
conscious
soul
it
can
not
then
is
my
soul
homeless
or
is
it
to
be
identified
with
the
activity
and
fortunes
of
a
single
atomic
constituent
of
my
body
a
single
cog
in
the
animal
clockwork
if
so
how
irrational
for
the
soul
does
not
experience
itself
as
the
soul
of
one
minute
part
but
as
the
soul
of
the
body
such
questions
rose
thick
and
fast
in
the
minds
of
the
philosophers
it
will
cause
us
no
great
surprise
that
leibniz
should
have
quickly
felt
that
the
formal
principle
of
aristotle
and
of
the
scholastic
philosophy
must
be
by
hook
or
by
crook
reintroduced
not
as
the
detested
but
under
a
name
by
which
it
might
hope
to
smell
more
sweet
nothing
so
tellingly
revealed
the
difficulties
of
the
new
philosophy
in
dealing
with
living
bodies
as
the
insufficiency
of
the
solutions
descartes
had
proposed
he
had
boldly
declared
the
unity
of
animal
life
to
be
purely
mechanical
and
denied
that
brutes
had
souls
at
all
or
any
sensation
he
had
to
admit
soul
in
man
but
he
still
denied
the
substantial
unity
of
the
human
body
it
was
put
together
like
a
watch
it
was
many
things
not
one
if
descartes
had
lived
in
our
time
he
would
have
been
delighted
to
compare
it
with
a
telephone
system
the
nerves
taking
the
place
of
the
wires
and
being
so
arranged
that
all
currents
of
spirit
flowing
in
them
converged
upon
a
single
unit
a
gland
at
the
base
of
the
brain
in
this
unit
or
in
the
convergence
of
all
the
motions
upon
it
the
of
the
body
virtually
consisted
and
the
soul
was
incarnate
not
in
the
plurality
of
members
for
how
could
it
being
one
indwell
many
things
but
in
the
single
gland
even
so
the
relation
between
the
soul
and
the
gland
was
absolutely
unintelligible
as
descartes
disarmingly
confessed
incarnation
was
all
very
well
in
the
old
philosophy
those
who
had
allowed
the
interaction
of
disparate
natures
throughout
the
physical
world
need
find
no
particular
difficulty
about
the
special
case
of
it
provided
by
incarnation
why
should
not
a
form
of
conscious
life
so
interact
with
what
would
otherwise
be
dead
matter
as
to
it
but
the
very
principle
of
the
new
philosophy
disallowed
the
interaction
of
disparate
natures
because
such
an
interaction
did
not
allow
of
exact
formulation
it
was
a
and
not
a
relation
from
a
purely
practical
point
of
view
the
much
derided
pineal
gland
theory
would
serve
if
we
could
be
content
to
view
descartes
as
a
man
who
wanted
to
make
the
world
safe
for
physical
science
then
there
would
be
a
good
deal
to
be
said
for
his
doctrine
in
the
old
philosophy
exact
science
had
been
frustrated
by
the
hypothesis
of
loose
relations
all
over
the
field
of
nature
descartes
had
cleared
them
from
as
much
of
the
field
as
science
was
then
in
a
position
to
investigate
he
allowed
only
one
such
relation
to
subsist
the
one
which
experience
appeared
unmistakably
to
force
upon
us
that
between
our
own
mind
and
its
bodily
vehicle
he
had
exorcized
the
spirits
from
the
rest
of
nature
and
though
there
was
a
spirit
here
which
could
not
be
exorcized
the
philosophic
conjurer
had
nevertheless
confined
it
and
its
unaccountable
pranks
within
a
minutely
narrow
magic
circle
all
mind
could
do
was
to
turn
the
one
tiny
switch
at
the
centre
of
its
animal
telephone
system
it
could
create
no
energy
it
could
merely
redirect
the
currents
actually
flowing
practically
this
might
do
but
speculatively
it
was
most
disturbing
for
if
the
relation
had
to
be
admitted
in
one
instance
it
was
admitted
in
principle
and
one
could
not
get
rid
of
the
suspicion
that
it
would
turn
up
elsewhere
and
that
the
banishment
of
it
from
every
other
field
represented
a
convenient
pragmatic
postulate
rather
than
a
solid
metaphysical
truth
moreover
the
correlation
of
the
unitary
soul
with
the
unitary
gland
might
do
justice
to
a
mechanistical
philosophy
but
it
did
not
do
justice
to
the
soul
own
consciousness
of
itself
the
soul
consciousness
is
the
or
of
the
life
of
the
whole
body
certainly
not
of
the
life
of
the
pineal
gland
nor
as
the
unreflective
nowadays
would
say
of
the
brain
i
am
not
conscious
in
or
of
my
brain
except
when
i
have
a
headache
consciousness
is
in
my
eyes
and
and
so
on
it
is
physically
true
no
doubt
that
consciousness
in
and
of
my
is
not
possible
without
the
functioning
of
my
brain
but
that
is
a
poor
reason
for
locating
the
consciousness
in
the
brain
the
filament
of
the
electric
bulb
will
not
be
incandescent
apart
from
the
functioning
of
the
dynamo
but
that
is
a
poor
reason
for
saying
that
the
incandescence
is
in
the
dynamo
certainly
the
area
of
representation
in
our
mind
is
not
simply
equivalent
to
the
area
of
our
body
but
in
so
far
as
the
confines
of
mental
representation
part
company
with
the
confines
of
the
body
it
is
not
that
they
may
contract
and
fall
back
upon
the
pineal
gland
but
that
they
may
expand
and
advance
over
the
surrounding
world
the
mind
does
not
represent
its
own
body
merely
it
represents
the
world
in
so
far
as
the
world
affects
that
body
or
is
physically
reproduced
in
it
the
mind
has
no
observable
natural
relation
to
the
pineal
gland
it
has
only
two
natural
relations
to
its
body
as
a
whole
and
to
its
effective
environment
what
descartes
had
really
done
was
to
pretend
that
the
soul
was
related
to
the
pineal
gland
as
it
is
in
fact
related
to
its
whole
body
and
then
that
it
was
related
to
the
bodily
members
as
in
fact
it
is
related
to
outer
environment
the
members
became
an
inner
environment
known
only
in
so
far
as
they
affected
the
pineal
gland
just
as
the
outer
environment
in
its
turn
was
to
be
known
only
in
so
far
as
it
affected
the
members
this
doctrine
of
a
double
environment
was
wholly
artificial
it
was
forced
on
descartes
by
the
requirements
of
mechanistical
science
if
the
members
were
simply
a
plurality
of
things
they
must
really
be
parts
of
environment
the
body
which
the
soul
indwelt
must
be
body
presumably
then
the
pineal
gland
an
untenable
compromise
surely
between
admitting
and
denying
the
reality
of
the
soul
incarnation
what
then
was
to
be
done
descartes
rivals
and
successors
attempted
several
solutions
which
it
would
be
too
long
to
examine
here
they
dissatisfied
leibniz
and
they
have
certainly
no
less
dissatisfied
posterity
it
will
be
enough
for
us
here
to
consider
what
leibniz
did
he
admitted
to
begin
with
the
psychological
fact
the
unity
of
consciousness
is
the
representation
of
a
plurality
the
plurality
of
the
members
and
through
them
the
plurality
of
the
world
here
surely
was
the
very
principle
the
new
philosophy
needed
for
the
reconciliation
of
substantial
unity
with
mechanical
plurality
of
parts
for
it
is
directly
evident
to
us
that
consciousness
focuses
the
plurality
of
environing
things
in
a
unity
of
representation
this
is
no
philosophical
theory
it
is
a
simple
fact
our
body
then
as
a
physical
system
is
a
mechanical
plurality
as
focused
in
consciousness
it
is
a
unity
of
very
well
but
we
have
not
got
far
yet
for
the
old
difficulty
still
remains
it
is
purely
arbitrary
after
all
that
a
unitary
consciousness
should
be
attached
to
and
represent
a
mechanical
collection
of
things
which
happen
to
interact
in
a
sort
of
pattern
if
there
is
a
consciousness
attached
to
human
bodies
then
why
not
to
systems
of
clockwork
if
the
body
is
as
unity
it
must
surely
be
because
it
unity
as
the
old
philosophy
had
held
but
how
can
we
reintroduce
unity
into
the
body
without
reintroducing
substantial
form
and
destroying
the
mechanistical
plurality
which
the
new
science
demanded
it
is
at
this
point
that
leibniz
produces
the
speculative
postulate
of
his
system
why
not
reverse
the
relation
and
make
the
members
represent
the
mind
as
the
mind
represents
the
members
for
then
the
unity
of
person
represented
in
the
mind
will
become
something
actual
in
the
members
also
representation
appears
to
common
sense
to
be
a
sort
of
traffic
if
my
mind
represents
my
bodily
members
something
happens
to
my
mind
for
it
becomes
a
representation
of
such
members
in
such
a
state
but
nothing
happens
to
the
members
by
their
being
so
represented
in
the
mind
the
mental
representation
obeys
the
bodily
facts
the
bodily
facts
do
not
obey
the
mental
representation
it
seems
nonsense
to
say
that
my
members
obey
my
mind
they
are
mirrored
in
it
and
yet
my
members
do
obey
my
mind
or
at
least
common
sense
supposes
so
sometimes
my
mind
instead
of
representing
the
state
my
members
are
in
represents
a
state
which
it
intends
that
they
shall
be
in
for
example
that
my
hand
should
go
through
the
motion
of
writing
these
words
and
my
hand
obeys
its
action
becomes
the
moving
diagram
of
my
thought
my
thought
is
represented
or
expressed
in
the
manual
act
here
the
relation
of
mind
and
members
appears
to
be
reversed
instead
of
its
representing
them
they
represent
it
with
this
representation
it
is
the
opposite
of
what
it
was
with
the
other
by
the
members
being
represented
in
the
mind
something
happened
to
the
mind
and
nothing
to
the
members
by
the
mind
being
represented
in
the
members
something
happens
to
the
members
and
nothing
to
the
mind
why
should
not
we
take
this
seriously
why
not
allow
that
there
is
traffic
by
one
relation
the
mind
represents
the
members
by
another
the
members
represent
the
mind
but
then
again
how
can
we
take
it
seriously
for
representation
in
the
required
sense
is
a
mental
act
brute
matter
can
represent
nothing
only
mind
can
represent
and
the
members
are
brute
matter
but
are
they
how
do
we
know
that
by
brute
matter
we
understand
extended
lumps
of
stuff
interacting
with
one
another
mechanically
as
do
for
example
two
cogs
in
a
piece
of
clockwork
but
this
is
a
view
the
cogs
are
themselves
composed
of
interrelated
parts
and
those
parts
of
others
and
so
on
who
knows
what
the
ultimate
constituents
really
are
the
philosophers
certainly
have
proposed
no
hypothesis
about
them
which
even
looks
like
making
sense
they
have
supposed
that
the
apparently
inert
lumps
the
cogs
are
composed
of
parts
themselves
equally
inert
and
that
by
subdivision
we
shall
still
reach
nothing
but
the
inert
but
this
supposition
is
in
flat
contradiction
with
what
physical
theory
demands
we
have
to
allow
the
reality
of
in
physics
now
the
force
which
bodies
display
may
easily
be
the
of
activity
in
their
minute
real
constituents
if
not
where
does
it
come
from
let
it
be
supposed
then
that
these
minute
real
constituents
are
active
because
they
are
alive
because
they
are
minds
for
indeed
we
have
no
notion
of
activity
other
than
the
perception
we
have
of
our
own
we
have
no
notion
of
it
except
as
something
mental
on
the
hypothesis
that
the
constituents
of
active
body
are
also
mental
this
limitation
in
our
conception
of
activity
need
cause
us
neither
sorrow
nor
surprise
the
which
make
up
body
will
not
of
course
be
developed
and
fully
conscious
minds
like
yours
or
mine
and
it
is
only
for
want
of
a
better
word
that
we
call
them
minds
at
all
they
will
be
mere
unselfconscious
representations
of
their
physical
environment
as
it
might
be
seen
from
the
physical
point
to
which
they
belong
by
a
human
mind
paying
no
attention
at
all
to
its
own
seeing
how
many
of
these
rudimentary
will
there
be
in
my
body
as
many
as
you
like
as
many
as
it
is
possible
there
should
be
say
an
infinite
number
and
have
done
with
it
we
may
now
observe
how
this
hypothesis
introduces
real
formal
unity
without
prejudicing
mechanical
plurality
each
of
the
in
my
body
is
itself
and
substantially
distinct
but
since
each
in
its
own
way
and
according
to
its
own
position
represents
the
superior
and
more
developed
mind
which
i
call
they
will
order
themselves
according
to
a
common
form
the
order
is
real
not
accidental
it
is
like
the
order
of
troops
on
a
each
man
is
a
distinct
active
unit
but
each
is
really
expressing
by
his
action
the
mind
of
the
officer
in
command
he
is
expressing
no
less
his
relation
to
the
other
men
in
the
ranks
to
obey
the
officer
is
to
keep
in
step
with
them
so
the
metaphysical
units
of
the
body
being
all
minds
represent
one
another
as
well
as
the
dominant
mind
one
another
the
dominant
mind
subordinately
but
if
the
metaphysically
real
units
of
the
body
are
of
the
nature
of
mind
then
mind
is
a
mind
among
minds
a
among
what
then
constitutes
its
superiority
or
dominance
and
makes
it
a
mind
well
what
constitutes
the
officer
an
officer
two
things
a
more
developed
mentality
and
the
fact
of
being
obeyed
in
military
life
these
two
factors
are
not
always
perfectly
proportioned
to
one
another
but
in
the
order
of
leibniz
universe
they
are
a
fuller
power
to
represent
the
universe
is
necessarily
combined
with
dominance
over
an
organized
troop
of
members
for
the
mind
knows
the
universe
only
in
so
far
as
the
universe
is
expressed
in
its
body
that
is
what
the
of
the
mind
means
only
an
infinite
mind
appreciates
the
whole
plurality
of
things
in
themselves
a
finite
mind
perceives
them
in
so
far
as
mirrored
in
the
physical
being
of
an
organized
body
of
members
the
more
adequate
the
mirror
the
more
adequate
the
representation
the
more
highly
organized
the
body
the
more
developed
the
mind
the
developed
mind
has
an
elaborate
body
but
the
least
developed
mind
has
still
some
body
or
it
would
lack
any
mirror
whatever
through
which
to
represent
the
world
this
means
in
effect
that
leibniz
system
is
not
an
unmitigated
spiritual
atomism
for
though
the
spiritual
atoms
or
monads
are
the
ultimate
constituents
out
of
which
nature
is
composed
they
stand
composed
together
from
the
beginning
in
a
minimal
order
which
can
not
be
broken
up
each
monad
if
it
is
to
be
anything
at
all
must
be
a
continuing
finite
representation
of
the
universe
and
to
be
that
it
must
have
a
body
that
is
to
say
it
must
have
other
monads
in
a
permanent
relation
of
mutual
correspondence
with
it
and
if
you
said
to
leibniz
surely
any
physical
body
can
be
broken
up
and
this
must
mean
the
dissolution
of
the
organic
relation
between
its
monadical
constituents
he
would
take
refuge
in
the
infinitesimal
the
wonders
revealed
by
that
new
miracle
the
microscope
suggested
what
the
intrinsic
divisibility
of
space
itself
suggests
whatever
organization
is
broken
up
there
will
still
be
a
minute
organization
within
each
of
the
fragments
which
remains
unbroken
and
so
you
will
never
come
down
to
loose
monads
monads
out
of
all
organization
you
will
never
disembody
the
monads
and
so
remove
their
representative
power
you
will
only
reduce
their
bodies
and
so
impoverish
their
representative
power
in
this
sense
no
animal
dies
and
no
animal
is
generated
death
is
the
reduction
and
generation
the
enrichment
of
some
existing
monad
body
and
by
being
that
is
the
enrichment
or
the
reduction
of
the
monad
mental
life
our
common
sense
protests
is
too
great
a
strain
on
our
credulity
to
make
the
real
nature
of
things
so
utterly
different
from
what
sense
and
science
make
of
them
if
the
real
universe
is
what
you
say
it
is
why
do
our
minds
represent
it
to
us
as
they
do
the
philosopher
answer
is
they
it
according
to
the
truth
of
things
each
monad
is
simply
its
own
mental
life
its
own
its
own
thoughts
and
desires
to
know
things
as
they
are
would
be
simultaneously
to
live
over
as
though
from
within
and
by
a
miracle
of
sympathy
the
biographies
of
an
infinite
number
of
distinct
monads
this
is
absolutely
impossible
our
senses
represent
the
coexistent
families
of
monads
the
and
therefore
conventionally
what
is
in
fact
the
mutual
representation
of
monads
in
ordered
systems
is
represented
as
the
mechanical
interaction
of
spatially
extended
and
material
parts
this
does
not
mean
that
science
is
overthrown
the
physical
is
in
terms
of
the
convention
of
representation
but
it
is
not
for
all
that
illusory
it
can
ideally
be
made
as
true
as
it
is
capable
of
being
there
is
no
reason
whatever
for
confusing
the
seemings
of
the
apparent
physical
world
with
the
fantastic
seemings
of
dream
and
hallucination
so
far
the
argument
seems
to
draw
whatever
cogency
it
has
from
the
simplicity
and
naturalness
of
the
notion
of
representation
the
nature
of
idea
it
is
assumed
is
to
represent
plurality
in
a
unified
view
if
idea
did
not
represent
it
would
not
be
idea
and
since
there
idea
for
our
minds
at
least
exist
and
are
made
up
of
idea
there
is
representation
it
belongs
to
idea
to
represent
and
since
the
whole
world
has
now
been
interpreted
as
a
system
of
mutually
representing
ideations
or
ideators
it
might
seem
that
all
their
mutual
relations
are
perfectly
natural
a
harmony
of
agreement
which
could
not
be
other
than
it
is
but
if
so
why
does
leibniz
keep
saying
that
the
harmony
is
by
special
and
infinitely
elaborate
divine
decrees
leibniz
himself
says
that
the
very
nature
of
representation
excludes
interaction
by
representing
environment
a
mind
does
not
do
anything
to
environment
that
is
plain
but
it
is
no
less
plain
that
environment
does
nothing
to
it
either
the
act
of
representing
is
simply
the
act
of
the
mind
it
represents
view
environment
of
course
but
not
under
the
causal
influence
of
environment
representation
is
a
business
carried
on
by
the
mind
on
its
own
account
and
in
virtue
of
its
innate
power
to
represent
very
well
but
does
this
consideration
really
drive
us
into
theology
is
not
leibniz
the
victim
of
a
familiar
fallacy
that
of
incompletely
stated
alternatives
finite
beings
interact
they
do
not
directly
condition
one
another
monads
do
not
interact
therefore
they
do
not
directly
condition
one
another
how
then
explain
the
actual
conformity
of
their
mutual
representation
without
recourse
to
divine
it
seems
sufficient
to
introduce
a
further
alternative
in
the
first
line
of
the
argument
and
we
are
rid
of
the
theology
things
may
condition
the
action
of
a
further
thing
without
acting
upon
it
it
acts
of
itself
but
it
acts
in
view
of
what
they
are
we
are
tempted
to
conclude
that
leibniz
has
introduced
the
ex
with
the
fatal
facility
of
his
age
a
little
further
meditation
on
the
characters
in
the
play
would
furnish
a
natural
he
swings
divine
intervention
on
to
the
scene
by
wires
from
the
ceiling
it
is
easy
for
us
to
reconstruct
for
him
the
end
of
the
piece
without
recourse
to
is
it
no
i
fear
it
is
not
there
is
really
no
avoiding
the
harmony
and
so
we
shall
discover
if
we
pursue
our
train
of
reflexion
a
little
further
it
is
natural
we
were
saying
than
an
idea
should
represent
an
environment
indeed
it
the
representation
of
one
given
no
environment
to
represent
it
would
be
empty
a
mere
capacity
for
representation
then
every
idea
or
ideator
taken
merely
in
itself
an
empty
capacity
but
of
what
is
the
environment
of
each
made
up
according
to
the
leibnitian
theory
of
further
ideas
or
ideators
of
empty
capacities
therefore
then
no
idea
will
either
be
anything
in
itself
or
find
anything
in
its
neighbours
to
represent
an
unhappy
predicament
like
that
of
a
literary
clique
in
which
all
the
members
are
adepts
at
discussing
one
another
ideas
only
that
unfortunately
none
of
them
are
provided
with
any
or
like
the
shaky
economics
of
the
fabled
irish
village
where
they
all
lived
by
taking
in
one
another
washing
it
is
useless
then
to
conceive
representations
as
simply
coming
into
existence
in
response
to
environment
and
modelling
themselves
on
environment
they
must
all
mutually
reflect
environment
or
they
would
not
be
representations
but
they
must
also
exist
as
themselves
and
in
their
own
right
or
there
would
be
no
environment
for
them
mutually
to
represent
since
the
world
is
infinitely
various
each
representor
must
have
its
own
distinct
character
or
nature
as
our
minds
have
that
is
to
say
it
must
represent
in
its
own
individual
way
and
all
these
endlessly
various
representations
must
be
so
constituted
as
to
form
a
mutually
reflecting
harmony
considered
as
a
representation
each
monadical
existence
simply
reflects
the
universe
after
its
own
manner
but
considered
as
something
to
be
represented
by
the
others
it
is
a
mental
life
or
world
of
ideas
now
when
we
are
considering
the
fact
of
representation
that
which
is
to
be
represented
comes
first
and
the
representation
follows
upon
it
thus
in
considering
the
leibnitian
universe
we
must
begin
with
the
monads
as
mental
lives
or
worlds
of
ideas
their
representation
of
one
another
comes
second
nothing
surely
then
but
omnipotent
creative
wisdom
could
have
between
so
many
distinct
given
mental
worlds
that
harmony
which
constitutes
their
mutual
representation
our
pluralistic
thinking
escapes
from
the
need
of
the
harmony
by
distinguishing
what
we
are
from
what
we
do
let
the
world
be
made
up
of
a
plurality
of
agents
in
a
order
with
room
to
manoeuvre
and
to
adjust
themselves
to
one
another
then
by
good
luck
or
good
management
through
friction
and
disaster
by
trial
and
error
by
accident
or
invention
they
may
work
out
for
themselves
a
harmony
of
there
is
no
need
for
divine
preordaining
here
but
on
view
what
the
monads
do
is
to
represent
and
what
they
are
is
representation
there
is
no
ultimate
distinction
between
what
they
are
and
what
they
do
all
that
they
do
belongs
to
what
they
are
the
whole
system
of
action
in
each
monad
which
fits
with
such
infinite
complexity
the
system
of
action
in
each
other
monad
is
precisely
the
existence
of
that
monad
and
apart
from
it
the
monad
is
not
the
monads
do
not
a
harmony
they
a
harmony
and
therefore
they
are
in
harmony
leibniz
denied
that
he
invoked
god
to
intervene
in
nature
or
that
there
was
anything
arbitrary
or
artificial
about
his
physical
theology
he
was
simply
analysing
nature
and
finding
it
to
be
a
system
of
mutual
representation
he
was
analysing
mutual
representation
and
finding
it
to
be
of
its
nature
intrinsically
and
therefore
he
was
not
adding
anything
to
mutual
representation
he
was
just
showing
what
it
necessarily
contained
or
implied
at
least
he
was
doing
nothing
worse
than
recognized
scholastic
practice
scholastic
aristotelianism
explained
all
natural
causality
as
response
to
stimulus
and
then
had
to
postulate
a
stimulus
which
stimulated
without
being
stimulated
and
this
was
god
apart
from
this
supreme
and
first
stimulus
nothing
would
in
fact
be
moving
the
aristotelians
claimed
simply
to
be
analysing
the
nature
of
physical
motion
as
they
perceived
it
and
to
find
the
necessity
of
perpetually
applied
divine
stimulation
implicit
in
it
no
violence
was
thereby
done
to
the
system
of
physical
motion
nor
was
anything
brought
in
from
without
to
patch
it
up
it
was
simply
found
to
be
of
its
own
nature
it
seems
as
though
the
reproachful
description
ex
should
be
reserved
for
more
arbitrary
expedients
than
aristotle
or
leibniz
say
for
the
occasionalist
theory
occasionalism
appeared
to
introduce
god
that
he
might
make
physical
matter
do
what
it
had
no
natural
tendency
to
do
viz
to
obey
the
volitions
of
finite
mind
ideas
on
the
other
hand
have
a
natural
tendency
to
represent
one
another
for
to
be
an
idea
is
to
be
a
representation
god
is
not
introduced
by
leibniz
to
make
them
correspond
he
is
introduced
to
work
a
system
in
which
they
shall
correspond
this
may
not
be
but
it
is
that
is
to
say
it
treats
divine
action
as
one
factor
among
the
factors
which
together
constitute
the
working
of
the
natural
system
and
this
appears
to
be
perhaps
unscientific
certainly
blasphemous
god
action
can
not
be
a
factor
among
factors
the
creator
works
through
and
in
all
creaturely
action
equally
we
can
never
say
is
the
creature
and
that
is
god
of
distinguishable
causalities
in
the
natural
world
the
creature
is
in
its
creaturely
action
but
because
a
creature
insufficient
to
itself
throughout
and
sustained
by
its
creator
both
in
existence
and
in
action
the
only
acceptable
argument
for
theism
is
that
which
corresponds
to
the
religious
consciousness
and
builds
upon
the
insufficiency
of
finite
existence
throughout
because
it
is
finite
all
arguments
to
existence
from
a
particular
gap
in
our
account
of
the
world
of
finites
are
to
be
rejected
they
do
not
indicate
god
they
indicate
the
failure
of
our
power
to
analyse
the
when
leibniz
discovered
that
his
system
of
mutual
representations
needed
to
be
he
ought
to
have
seen
that
he
had
come
up
a
and
backed
out
he
ought
not
to
have
said
the
help
of
god
i
will
leap
over
the
wall
if
we
condemn
leibniz
for
writing
physical
theology
we
condemn
not
him
but
his
age
no
contemporary
practice
was
any
better
and
much
of
it
a
good
deal
worse
as
leibniz
liked
somewhat
complacently
to
point
out
and
because
he
comes
to
theology
through
physical
theology
that
does
not
mean
that
all
his
theology
was
physical
theology
and
as
such
to
be
written
off
on
the
contrary
leibniz
is
led
to
wrestle
with
many
problems
which
beset
any
philosophical
theism
of
the
christian
type
this
is
particularly
so
in
the
as
its
many
citations
of
theologians
suggest
his
discussions
never
lack
ingenuity
and
the
system
of
creation
and
providence
in
which
they
result
has
much
of
that
luminous
serenity
which
colours
the
best
works
of
the
age
of
reason
every
theistic
philosopher
is
bound
with
whatever
cautions
to
conceive
god
by
the
analogy
of
the
human
mind
when
leibniz
declares
the
harmony
of
monads
to
be
by
god
he
is
invoking
the
image
of
intelligent
human
nor
is
he
content
simply
to
leave
it
at
that
he
endeavours
as
well
as
he
may
to
conceive
the
sort
of
act
by
which
god
and
this
involves
the
detailed
adaptation
for
theological
purposes
of
leibnitian
doctrine
about
the
human
mind
the
human
mind
as
we
have
seen
is
the
mind
predominant
in
a
certain
system
of
viz
in
those
which
constitute
the
members
of
the
human
body
if
we
call
it
predominant
we
mean
that
its
system
of
ideas
is
more
developed
than
theirs
so
that
there
are
more
points
in
which
each
of
them
conforms
to
it
than
in
which
it
conforms
to
any
one
of
them
the
conception
of
a
divine
mind
will
be
analogous
it
will
be
the
conception
of
a
mind
dominant
to
whose
ideas
that
is
to
say
the
whole
system
simply
corresponds
without
any
reciprocating
correspondence
on
his
side
in
a
certain
sense
this
is
to
make
god
the
of
the
world
and
yet
the
associations
of
the
phrase
are
misleading
it
suggests
that
the
world
is
an
organism
or
body
in
which
the
divine
mind
is
incarnate
and
on
which
he
relies
for
his
representations
but
that
is
nonsense
the
world
is
not
body
nor
is
it
organic
to
god
absolute
dominance
involves
absolute
transcendence
if
everything
in
the
world
without
remainder
simply
obeys
the
divine
thoughts
that
is
only
another
way
of
saying
that
the
world
is
the
creature
of
god
the
whole
system
is
by
him
who
is
absolute
being
and
perfectly
independent
of
the
world
of
createdness
or
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
we
can
think
of
it
as
nothing
but
the
pure
or
absolute
case
of
subjection
to
dominant
mind
it
is
no
use
asking
further
god
thoughts
are
obeyed
in
the
existence
and
action
of
things
what
we
can
and
must
enquire
into
further
is
the
nature
of
the
divine
thoughts
which
are
thus
obeyed
they
must
be
understood
to
be
volitions
or
decrees
there
are
indeed
two
ways
in
which
things
obey
the
divine
thought
and
correspondingly
two
sorts
of
divine
thoughts
that
they
obey
in
so
far
as
created
things
conform
to
the
mere
universal
principles
of
reason
they
obey
a
reasonableness
which
is
an
inherent
characteristic
of
the
divine
mind
itself
if
god
wills
the
existence
of
any
creature
that
creature
existence
must
observe
the
limits
prescribed
by
eternal
reason
it
can
not
for
example
both
have
and
lack
a
certain
characteristic
in
the
same
sense
and
at
the
same
time
nor
can
it
contain
two
parts
and
two
parts
which
are
not
also
countable
as
one
part
and
three
parts
finite
things
if
they
exist
at
all
must
thus
conform
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
divine
nature
but
what
the
divine
reasonableness
thus
prescribes
is
highly
general
we
can
deduce
from
it
only
certain
laws
which
any
finite
things
must
obey
we
can
never
deduce
from
it
which
finite
things
there
are
to
be
nor
indeed
that
there
are
to
be
any
finite
things
are
particular
and
individual
each
of
them
might
have
been
other
than
it
is
or
to
speak
more
properly
instead
of
any
one
of
them
there
might
have
existed
something
else
it
was
according
to
the
mere
principles
of
eternal
reason
equally
possible
but
if
so
the
whole
universe
being
made
up
of
things
each
of
which
might
be
otherwise
might
as
a
whole
be
otherwise
therefore
the
divine
thoughts
which
it
obeys
by
existing
have
the
nature
of
or
what
material
does
the
finite
mind
supply
for
an
analogical
picture
of
the
infinite
mind
making
choices
or
decrees
if
we
use
such
language
of
god
we
are
using
language
which
has
its
first
and
natural
application
to
ourselves
we
all
of
us
choose
and
those
of
us
who
are
in
authority
make
decrees
what
is
to
choose
it
involves
a
real
freedom
in
the
mind
a
finite
mind
let
us
remember
is
nothing
but
a
succession
of
perceptions
ideas
or
representations
with
regard
to
some
of
our
ideas
we
have
no
freedom
those
for
example
which
represent
to
us
our
body
we
think
of
them
as
constituting
our
given
substance
they
are
sheer
datum
for
us
and
so
are
those
reflexions
of
our
environment
which
they
mediate
to
us
they
make
up
a
closely
packed
and
confused
mass
they
persevere
in
their
being
with
an
obstinate
innate
force
the
spiritual
counterpart
of
the
force
which
we
have
to
recognize
in
things
as
physically
interpreted
being
real
spiritual
force
it
is
and
indeed
do
we
not
love
our
own
existence
and
in
a
sense
will
it
in
all
its
necessary
circumstances
but
if
we
can
be
said
to
will
to
be
ourselves
and
to
enact
with
native
force
what
our
body
and
its
environment
makes
us
we
are
merely
willing
to
conform
to
the
conditions
of
our
existence
we
are
making
no
choice
when
however
we
think
freely
or
perform
deliberate
acts
there
is
not
only
force
but
choice
in
our
activity
choice
between
what
between
alternative
possibilities
arising
out
of
our
situation
and
choice
in
virtue
of
what
in
virtue
of
the
appeal
exercised
by
one
alternative
as
seemingly
better
can
we
adapt
our
scheme
of
choice
to
the
description
of
god
creative
decrees
we
will
take
the
second
point
in
it
first
our
choice
is
in
virtue
of
the
appeal
of
the
seeming
best
surely
the
only
corrective
necessary
in
applying
this
to
god
is
the
omission
of
the
word
his
choice
is
in
virtue
of
the
appeal
of
the
simply
best
the
other
point
causes
more
trouble
we
choose
between
possibilities
which
arise
for
us
out
of
our
situation
in
the
system
of
the
existing
world
but
as
the
world
does
not
exist
before
god
creative
choices
he
is
in
no
and
no
alternative
possibilities
can
arise
out
of
it
between
which
he
should
have
to
choose
but
if
god
does
not
choose
between
intrinsic
possibilities
of
some
kind
his
choice
becomes
something
absolutely
meaningless
to
us
it
is
not
a
choice
at
all
it
is
an
arbitrary
and
unintelligible
leibniz
solution
is
this
what
are
mere
possibilities
of
thought
for
us
are
possibilities
of
action
for
god
for
a
human
subject
possibilities
of
action
are
limited
to
what
arises
out
of
his
actual
situation
but
possibilities
for
thought
are
not
so
limited
i
can
conceive
a
world
different
in
many
respects
from
this
world
in
which
for
example
vegetables
should
be
gifted
with
thought
and
speech
but
i
can
do
nothing
towards
bringing
it
about
my
imaginary
world
is
practically
impossible
but
speculatively
possible
in
the
sense
that
it
contradicts
no
single
principle
of
necessary
and
immutable
reason
i
indeed
can
explore
only
a
very
little
way
into
the
region
of
sheer
speculative
possibility
god
does
not
explore
it
he
simply
possesses
it
all
the
whole
region
of
the
possible
is
but
a
part
of
the
content
of
his
infinite
mind
so
among
all
possible
creatures
he
chooses
the
best
and
creates
it
but
the
whole
realm
of
the
possible
is
an
actual
infinity
of
ideas
out
of
the
consideration
of
an
infinity
of
ideas
how
can
god
arrive
at
a
choice
why
not
his
mind
is
not
of
course
discursive
he
does
not
successively
turn
over
the
leaves
of
an
infinite
book
of
sample
worlds
for
then
he
would
never
come
to
the
end
of
it
embracing
infinite
possibility
in
the
single
act
of
his
mind
he
settles
his
will
with
intuitive
immediacy
upon
the
best
the
inferior
the
monstrous
the
absurd
is
not
a
wilderness
through
which
he
painfully
threads
his
way
it
is
that
from
which
he
immediately
turns
his
wisdom
is
his
elimination
of
it
but
in
so
applying
the
scheme
of
choice
to
god
act
have
we
not
invalidated
its
application
to
our
own
for
if
god
has
chosen
the
whole
form
and
fabric
of
the
world
he
has
chosen
everything
in
it
including
the
choices
we
shall
make
and
if
our
choices
have
already
been
chosen
for
us
by
god
it
would
seem
to
follow
that
they
are
not
real
open
choices
on
our
part
at
all
but
are
and
if
they
are
it
would
seem
that
they
are
not
really
even
choices
for
a
determined
choice
is
not
a
choice
but
if
we
do
not
ourselves
exercise
real
choice
in
any
degree
then
we
have
no
clue
to
what
any
choice
would
be
and
if
so
we
have
no
power
of
conceiving
divine
choice
either
and
so
the
whole
argument
cuts
its
own
throat
there
are
two
possible
lines
of
escape
from
this
predicament
one
is
to
define
human
choice
in
such
a
sense
that
it
allows
of
without
ceasing
to
be
choice
and
this
is
leibniz
method
and
it
can
be
studied
at
length
in
the
he
certainly
makes
the
very
best
he
can
of
it
and
it
hardly
seems
that
any
of
those
contemporaries
whose
views
he
criticizes
was
in
a
position
to
answer
him
the
alternative
method
is
to
make
the
most
of
the
negative
element
involved
in
all
theology
after
all
we
do
not
positively
or
adequately
understand
the
nature
of
infinite
creative
will
perhaps
it
is
precisely
the
transcendent
glory
of
divine
freedom
to
be
able
to
work
infallibly
through
free
instruments
but
so
mystical
a
paradox
is
not
the
sort
of
thing
we
can
expect
to
appeal
to
a
philosopher
one
criticism
of
leibniz
argument
we
can
not
refrain
from
making
he
allows
himself
too
easy
a
triumph
when
he
says
that
the
only
alternative
to
a
choice
determined
by
a
prevailing
inclination
towards
one
proposal
is
a
choice
of
mere
caprice
there
is
a
sort
of
choice
leibniz
never
so
much
as
considers
and
which
appears
at
least
to
fall
quite
outside
his
categories
and
that
is
the
sort
of
choice
exercised
in
artistic
creativity
in
such
choice
we
freely
feel
after
the
shaping
of
a
scheme
we
do
not
arbitrate
simply
between
shaped
and
given
possible
schemes
and
perhaps
some
such
element
enters
into
all
our
choices
since
our
life
is
to
some
extent
freely
designed
by
ourselves
if
so
our
minds
are
even
more
akin
to
the
divine
mind
than
leibniz
realized
for
the
sort
of
choice
we
are
now
referring
to
seems
to
be
an
intuitive
turning
away
from
an
infinite
or
at
least
indefinite
range
of
less
attractive
possibility
and
such
is
the
nature
of
the
divine
creative
choice
the
consequence
of
such
a
line
of
speculation
would
be
that
the
divine
mind
designs
more
through
us
and
less
simply
for
us
than
leibniz
allowed
the
into
which
we
enter
would
be
no
longer
simply
leibniz
in
fact
could
have
nothing
to
do
with
such
a
suggestion
and
he
would
have
found
it
easy
to
be
ironical
about
it
if
his
contemporaries
had
proposed
it
ii
leibniz
wrote
two
books
a
considerable
number
of
articles
in
learned
periodicals
and
an
enormous
number
of
unpublished
notes
papers
and
letters
preserved
in
the
archives
of
the
electors
of
hanover
not
because
of
the
philosophical
significance
of
some
of
them
but
because
of
the
political
importance
of
most
of
them
from
among
this
great
mass
various
excerpts
of
philosophical
interest
have
been
made
by
successive
editors
of
leibniz
works
it
may
be
that
the
most
profound
understanding
of
his
mind
is
to
be
derived
from
some
of
these
pieces
but
if
we
wish
to
consider
the
public
history
of
leibniz
we
may
set
them
aside
of
the
two
books
one
was
published
and
the
other
never
was
the
remained
in
leibniz
desk
the
saw
the
light
and
so
to
his
own
and
the
succeeding
generation
leibniz
was
known
as
the
author
of
the
the
articles
in
journals
form
the
immediate
background
to
the
two
books
in
leibniz
heard
that
a
french
translation
of
locke
concerning
human
was
being
prepared
at
amsterdam
he
wrote
some
polite
comments
on
locke
great
work
and
published
them
he
also
sent
them
to
locke
hoping
that
locke
would
write
a
reply
and
that
leibniz
reflexions
and
locke
reply
might
be
appended
to
the
projected
french
translation
but
locke
set
leibniz
comments
aside
leibniz
not
to
be
defeated
set
to
work
upon
the
in
which
the
whole
substance
of
locke
book
is
systematically
discussed
in
dialogue
the
were
written
in
but
meanwhile
a
painful
dispute
had
broken
out
between
leibniz
and
the
disciples
of
locke
and
newton
in
which
the
english
and
perhaps
newton
himself
were
much
to
blame
and
leibniz
thought
it
impolitic
to
publish
his
book
it
was
not
issued
until
long
after
his
death
in
the
middle
of
the
century
the
discussion
with
locke
was
a
failure
locke
would
not
play
and
the
book
in
which
the
whole
controversy
was
to
be
systematized
never
appeared
the
discussion
with
bayle
on
the
other
hand
was
a
model
of
what
a
discussion
should
be
bayle
played
up
tirelessly
and
was
never
embarrassingly
profound
he
provided
just
the
sort
of
objections
most
useful
for
drawing
forth
illuminating
expositions
he
was
as
good
as
a
fictitious
character
in
a
philosophical
dialogue
and
the
book
in
which
the
controversy
was
systematized
duly
appeared
with
great
éclat
here
is
the
history
of
the
controversy
in
leibniz
was
years
old
he
had
just
emerged
from
a
period
of
close
employment
under
his
prince
commands
and
he
thought
fit
to
try
his
metaphysical
principles
upon
the
polite
world
and
see
what
would
come
of
it
he
therefore
published
an
article
in
the
des
under
the
title
system
of
nature
and
of
the
communication
of
substances
as
well
as
of
the
union
between
soul
and
body
in
the
same
year
foucher
published
an
article
in
the
controverting
leibniz
and
in
the
next
year
leibniz
replied
with
an
a
second
explanation
in
the
same
year
appeared
in
basnage
des
ouvrages
des
in
answer
to
reflexions
by
the
editor
pierre
bayle
had
all
these
articles
before
him
when
he
inserted
a
note
on
leibniz
doctrine
in
his
article
on
in
the
first
edition
of
his
and
critical
the
point
of
connexion
between
rorarius
and
leibniz
was
no
more
than
this
that
both
held
views
about
the
souls
of
beasts
pierre
bayle
was
the
son
of
a
calvinist
pastor
early
converted
to
catholicism
but
recovered
to
his
old
faith
after
a
short
time
he
held
academic
employments
in
switzerland
and
holland
he
promoted
and
edited
the
de
la
république
des
and
he
produced
that
extraordinary
work
the
and
critical
the
notices
it
contains
of
authors
and
thinkers
are
little
more
than
pegs
upon
which
bayle
could
hang
his
philosophical
reflexions
he
could
write
an
intelligent
discussion
on
any
opinion
what
he
could
not
do
was
to
reconcile
the
points
of
view
from
which
he
felt
impelled
to
write
upon
this
author
and
that
his
was
not
a
systematic
mind
so
far
as
he
had
a
philosophical
opinion
he
was
a
cartesian
in
theology
he
was
an
orthodox
calvinist
he
could
not
reconcile
his
theology
with
his
cartesianism
and
he
did
not
try
to
he
made
a
merit
of
the
oppositions
of
faith
to
reason
and
reason
to
itself
so
that
he
could
throw
himself
upon
a
meritorious
and
voluntary
faith
there
is
nothing
original
in
this
position
it
was
characteristic
of
decadent
scholasticism
it
squared
with
luther
exaggerations
about
the
impotence
of
reason
in
fallen
man
and
pascal
had
given
his
own
highly
personal
twist
to
it
bayle
has
been
hailed
as
a
forerunner
of
voltairean
scepticism
it
would
be
truer
to
say
that
a
voltairean
sceptic
could
read
bayle
discussions
in
his
own
sense
and
for
his
own
purposes
if
he
wished
but
bayle
was
not
a
sceptic
it
is
hard
to
say
what
he
was
his
whole
position
as
between
faith
and
reason
is
hopelessly
confused
he
was
a
scholar
a
wit
and
a
philosophical
of
so
perfectly
convenient
a
kind
that
if
we
had
not
evidence
of
his
historical
reality
we
might
have
suspected
leibniz
of
inventing
him
in
the
first
edition
of
his
under
the
article
bayle
gave
a
very
fair
account
of
leibniz
doctrine
concerning
the
souls
of
animals
as
it
could
be
collected
from
his
article
in
the
des
june
he
then
proceeded
to
comment
upon
it
in
the
following
terms
are
some
things
in
leibniz
hypothesis
that
are
liable
to
some
difficulties
though
they
show
the
great
extent
of
his
genius
he
will
have
it
for
example
that
the
soul
of
a
dog
acts
independently
of
outward
bodies
that
stands
upon
its
own
bottom
by
a
perfect
with
respect
to
itself
and
yet
with
a
perfect
to
outward
that
internal
perceptions
arise
from
its
original
constitution
that
is
to
say
the
representative
constitution
capable
of
expressing
beings
outside
itself
in
relation
to
its
organs
which
was
bestowed
upon
it
from
the
time
of
its
creation
and
makes
its
individual
des
july
from
whence
it
results
that
it
would
feel
hunger
and
thirst
at
such
and
such
an
hour
though
there
were
not
any
one
body
in
the
universe
and
nothing
should
exist
but
god
and
that
he
has
explained
des
ouvrages
des
his
thought
by
the
example
of
two
pendulums
that
should
perfectly
agree
that
is
he
supposes
that
according
to
the
particular
laws
which
put
the
soul
upon
action
it
must
feel
hunger
at
such
an
hour
and
that
according
to
the
particular
laws
which
direct
the
motion
of
matter
the
body
which
is
united
to
that
soul
must
be
modified
at
that
same
hour
as
it
is
modified
when
the
soul
is
hungry
i
will
forbear
preferring
this
system
to
that
of
occasional
causes
till
the
learned
author
has
perfected
it
i
can
not
apprehend
the
connexion
of
internal
and
spontaneous
actions
which
would
have
this
effect
that
the
soul
of
a
dog
would
feel
pain
immediately
after
having
felt
joy
though
it
were
alone
in
the
universe
i
understand
why
a
dog
passes
immediately
from
pleasure
to
pain
when
being
very
hungry
and
eating
a
piece
of
bread
he
is
suddenly
struck
with
a
cudgel
but
i
can
not
apprehend
that
his
soul
should
be
so
framed
that
at
the
very
moment
of
his
being
beaten
he
should
feel
pain
though
he
were
not
beaten
and
though
he
should
continue
to
eat
bread
without
any
trouble
or
hindrance
nor
do
i
see
how
the
spontaneity
of
that
soul
should
be
consistent
with
the
sense
of
pain
and
in
general
with
any
unpleasing
perceptions
the
reason
why
this
learned
man
does
not
like
the
cartesian
system
seems
to
me
to
be
a
false
supposition
for
it
can
not
be
said
that
the
system
of
occasional
causes
brings
in
god
acting
by
a
miracle
ibid
ex
in
the
mutual
dependency
of
the
body
and
soul
for
since
god
does
only
intervene
according
to
general
laws
he
can
not
be
said
to
act
in
an
extraordinary
manner
does
the
internal
and
active
virtue
communicated
to
the
forms
of
bodies
according
to
leibniz
know
the
train
of
actions
which
it
is
to
produce
by
no
means
for
we
know
by
experience
that
we
are
ignorant
whether
we
shall
have
such
and
such
perceptions
in
an
hour
time
it
were
therefore
necessary
that
the
forms
should
be
directed
by
some
internal
principle
in
the
production
of
their
acts
but
this
would
be
ex
machina
as
much
as
in
the
system
of
occasional
causes
in
fine
as
he
supposes
with
great
reason
that
all
souls
are
simple
and
indivisible
it
can
not
be
apprehended
how
they
can
be
compared
with
a
pendulum
that
is
how
by
their
original
constitution
they
can
diversify
their
operations
by
using
the
spontaneous
activity
bestowed
upon
them
by
their
creator
it
may
clearly
be
conceived
that
a
simple
being
will
always
act
in
a
uniform
manner
if
no
external
cause
hinders
it
if
it
were
composed
of
several
pieces
as
a
machine
it
would
act
different
ways
because
the
peculiar
activity
of
each
piece
might
change
every
moment
the
progress
of
others
but
how
will
you
find
in
a
simple
substance
the
cause
of
a
change
of
operation
leibniz
published
a
reply
to
bayle
in
the
des
ouvrages
des
for
july
as
in
all
his
references
to
bayle
he
is
studiously
polite
and
repays
compliment
for
compliment
the
following
are
perhaps
the
principal
points
of
his
answer
on
the
example
of
the
dog
how
should
it
of
itself
change
its
sentiment
since
everything
left
to
itself
continues
in
the
state
in
which
it
is
because
the
state
may
be
a
state
of
as
in
a
moving
body
which
unless
hindered
continues
to
move
and
such
is
the
nature
of
simple
substances
they
continue
to
evolve
steadily
would
it
really
feel
as
though
beaten
if
it
were
not
beaten
since
leibniz
says
that
the
action
of
every
substance
takes
place
as
though
nothing
existed
but
god
and
itself
leibniz
replies
that
his
remark
refers
to
the
causality
behind
an
action
not
to
the
reasons
for
it
the
spontaneous
action
of
the
dog
which
leads
to
the
feeling
of
pain
is
only
decreed
to
be
what
it
is
for
the
reason
that
the
dog
is
part
of
a
world
of
mutually
reflecting
substances
a
world
which
also
includes
the
cudgel
why
should
the
dog
ever
be
displeased
leibniz
distinguishes
the
spontaneous
from
the
voluntary
many
things
occur
in
the
mind
of
itself
but
not
chosen
by
it
on
cartesianism
and
miracle
cartesianism
in
the
form
of
occasionalism
involve
miracle
for
though
god
is
said
by
it
to
act
according
to
laws
in
conforming
body
and
mind
to
one
another
he
thereby
causes
them
to
act
beyond
their
natural
capacities
on
the
problem
how
can
the
simple
act
otherwise
than
uniformly
leibniz
distinguishes
some
uniform
action
is
monotonous
but
some
is
not
a
point
moves
uniformly
in
describing
a
parabola
for
it
constantly
fulfils
the
formula
of
the
curve
but
it
does
not
move
monotonously
for
the
curve
constantly
varies
such
is
the
uniformity
of
the
action
of
simple
substances
bayle
read
this
reply
and
was
pleased
but
not
satisfied
with
it
in
the
second
edition
of
the
dictionary
under
the
same
article
he
added
the
following
note
declare
first
of
all
that
i
am
very
glad
i
have
proposed
some
small
difficulties
against
the
system
of
that
great
philosopher
since
they
have
occasioned
some
answers
whereby
that
subject
has
been
made
clearer
to
me
and
which
have
given
me
a
more
distinct
notion
of
what
is
most
to
be
admired
in
it
i
look
now
upon
that
new
system
as
an
important
conquest
which
enlarges
the
bounds
of
philosophy
we
had
only
two
hypotheses
that
of
the
schools
and
that
of
the
cartesians
the
one
was
a
of
of
the
body
upon
the
soul
and
of
the
soul
upon
the
body
the
other
was
a
of
or
occasional
causality
but
here
is
a
new
acquisition
a
new
hypothesis
which
may
be
called
as
fr
lami
styles
it
a
of
we
are
beholden
for
it
to
leibniz
and
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
anything
that
gives
us
a
nobler
idea
of
the
power
and
wisdom
of
the
author
of
all
things
this
together
with
the
advantage
of
setting
aside
all
notions
of
a
miraculous
conduct
would
engage
me
to
prefer
this
new
system
to
that
of
the
cartesians
if
i
could
conceive
any
possibility
in
the
of
desire
the
reader
to
take
notice
that
though
i
confess
that
this
way
removes
all
notions
of
a
miraculous
conduct
yet
i
do
not
retract
what
i
have
said
formerly
that
the
system
of
occasional
causes
does
not
bring
in
god
acting
miraculously
see
leibniz
article
in
des
ouvrages
des
july
i
am
as
much
persuaded
as
ever
i
was
that
an
action
can
not
be
said
to
be
miraculous
unless
god
produces
it
as
an
exception
to
the
general
laws
and
that
everything
of
which
he
is
immediately
the
author
according
to
those
laws
is
distinct
from
a
miracle
properly
so
called
but
being
willing
to
cut
off
from
this
dispute
as
many
things
as
i
possibly
can
i
consent
it
should
be
said
that
the
surest
way
of
removing
all
notions
that
include
a
miracle
is
to
suppose
that
all
created
substances
are
actively
the
immediate
causes
of
the
effects
of
nature
i
will
therefore
lay
aside
what
i
might
reply
to
that
part
of
leibniz
answer
will
also
omit
all
objections
which
are
not
more
contrary
to
his
opinion
than
to
that
of
some
other
philosophers
i
will
not
therefore
propose
the
difficulties
that
may
be
raised
against
the
supposition
that
a
creature
can
receive
from
god
the
power
of
moving
itself
they
are
strong
and
almost
unanswerable
but
leibniz
system
does
not
lie
more
open
to
them
than
that
of
the
aristotelians
nay
i
do
not
know
whether
the
cartesians
would
presume
to
say
that
god
can
not
communicate
to
our
souls
a
power
of
acting
if
they
say
so
how
can
they
own
that
adam
sinned
and
if
they
dare
not
say
so
they
weaken
the
arguments
whereby
they
endeavour
to
prove
that
matter
is
not
capable
of
any
activity
nor
do
i
believe
that
it
is
more
difficult
for
leibniz
than
for
the
cartesians
or
other
philosophers
to
free
himself
from
the
objection
of
a
fatal
mechanism
which
destroys
human
liberty
wherefore
waiving
this
i
shall
only
speak
of
what
is
peculiar
to
the
system
of
the
my
first
observation
shall
be
that
it
raises
the
power
and
wisdom
of
the
divine
art
above
everything
that
can
be
conceived
fancy
to
yourself
a
ship
which
without
having
any
sense
or
knowledge
and
without
being
directed
by
any
created
or
uncreated
being
has
the
power
of
moving
itself
so
seasonably
as
to
have
always
the
wind
favourable
to
avoid
currents
and
rocks
to
cast
anchor
where
it
ought
to
be
done
and
to
retire
into
a
harbour
precisely
when
it
is
necessary
suppose
such
a
ship
sails
in
that
manner
for
several
years
successively
being
always
turned
and
situated
as
it
ought
to
be
according
to
the
several
changes
of
the
air
and
the
different
situations
of
seas
and
lands
you
will
acknowledge
that
god
notwithstanding
his
infinite
power
can
not
communicate
such
a
faculty
to
a
ship
or
rather
you
will
say
that
the
nature
of
a
ship
is
not
capable
of
receiving
it
from
god
and
yet
what
leibniz
supposes
about
the
machine
of
a
human
body
is
more
admirable
and
more
surprising
than
all
this
let
us
apply
his
system
concerning
the
union
of
the
soul
with
the
body
to
the
person
of
julius
caesar
we
must
say
according
to
this
system
that
the
body
of
julius
caesar
did
so
exercise
its
moving
faculty
that
from
its
birth
to
its
death
it
went
through
continual
changes
which
did
most
exactly
answer
the
perpetual
changes
of
a
certain
soul
which
it
did
not
know
and
which
made
no
impression
on
it
we
must
say
that
the
rule
according
to
which
that
faculty
of
caesar
body
performed
such
actions
was
such
that
he
would
have
gone
to
the
senate
upon
such
a
day
and
at
such
an
hour
that
he
would
have
spoken
there
such
and
such
words
though
god
had
willed
to
annihilate
his
soul
the
next
day
after
it
was
created
we
must
say
that
this
moving
power
did
change
and
modify
itself
exactly
according
to
the
volubility
of
the
thoughts
of
that
ambitious
man
and
that
it
was
affected
precisely
in
a
certain
manner
rather
than
in
another
because
the
soul
of
caesar
passed
from
a
certain
thought
to
another
can
a
blind
power
modify
itself
so
exactly
by
virtue
of
an
impression
communicated
thirty
or
forty
years
before
and
never
renewed
since
but
left
to
itself
without
ever
knowing
what
it
is
to
do
is
not
this
much
more
incomprehensible
than
the
navigation
i
spoke
of
in
the
foregoing
paragraph
the
difficulty
will
be
greater
still
if
it
be
considered
that
the
human
machine
contains
an
almost
infinite
number
of
organs
and
that
it
is
continually
exposed
to
the
shock
of
the
bodies
that
surround
it
and
which
by
an
innumerable
variety
of
shakings
produce
in
it
a
thousand
sorts
of
modifications
how
is
it
possible
to
conceive
that
this
should
never
be
disordered
but
go
on
still
during
the
longest
life
of
a
man
notwithstanding
the
infinite
varieties
of
the
reciprocal
action
of
so
many
organs
upon
one
another
which
are
surrounded
on
all
sides
with
infinite
corpuscles
sometimes
hot
and
sometimes
cold
sometimes
dry
and
sometimes
moist
and
always
acting
and
pricking
the
nerves
a
thousand
different
ways
suppose
that
the
multiplicity
of
organs
and
of
external
agents
be
a
necessary
instrument
of
the
almost
infinite
variety
of
changes
in
a
human
body
will
that
variety
have
the
exactness
here
required
will
it
never
disturb
the
correspondence
of
those
changes
with
the
changes
of
the
soul
this
seems
to
be
altogether
impossible
to
leibniz
what
is
active
in
every
substance
ought
to
be
reduced
to
a
true
unity
since
therefore
the
body
of
every
man
is
composed
of
several
substances
each
of
them
ought
to
have
a
principle
of
action
really
distinct
from
the
principle
of
each
of
the
others
he
will
have
the
action
of
every
principle
to
be
spontaneous
now
this
must
vary
the
effects
and
confound
them
for
the
impression
of
the
neighbouring
bodies
must
needs
put
some
constraint
upon
the
natural
spontaneity
of
every
one
of
them
it
is
in
vain
to
have
recourse
to
the
power
of
god
in
order
to
maintain
that
brutes
are
mere
machines
it
is
in
vain
to
say
that
god
was
able
to
make
machines
so
artfully
contrived
that
the
voice
of
a
man
the
reflected
light
of
an
object
will
strike
them
exactly
where
it
is
necessary
that
they
may
move
in
a
given
manner
this
supposition
is
rejected
by
everybody
except
some
cartesians
and
no
cartesian
would
admit
it
if
it
were
to
be
extended
to
man
that
is
if
anyone
were
to
assert
that
god
was
able
to
form
such
bodies
as
would
mechanically
do
whatever
we
see
other
men
do
by
denying
this
we
do
not
pretend
to
limit
the
power
and
knowledge
of
god
we
only
mean
that
the
nature
of
things
does
not
permit
that
the
faculties
imparted
to
a
creature
should
not
be
necessarily
confined
within
certain
bounds
the
actions
of
creatures
must
be
necessarily
proportioned
to
their
essential
state
and
performed
according
to
the
character
belonging
to
each
machine
for
according
to
the
maxim
of
the
philosophers
whatever
is
received
is
proportionate
to
the
capacity
of
the
subject
that
receives
it
we
may
therefore
reject
hypothesis
as
being
impossible
since
it
is
liable
to
greater
difficulties
than
that
of
the
cartesians
which
makes
beasts
to
be
mere
machines
it
puts
a
perpetual
harmony
between
two
beings
which
do
not
act
one
upon
another
whereas
if
servants
were
mere
machines
and
should
punctually
obey
their
masters
command
it
could
not
be
said
that
they
do
it
without
a
real
action
of
their
masters
upon
them
for
their
masters
would
speak
words
and
make
signs
which
would
really
shake
and
move
the
organs
of
the
servants
now
let
us
consider
the
soul
of
julius
caesar
and
we
shall
find
the
thing
more
impossible
still
that
soul
was
in
the
world
without
being
exposed
to
the
influence
of
any
spirit
the
power
it
received
from
god
was
the
only
principle
of
the
actions
it
produced
at
every
moment
and
if
those
actions
were
different
one
from
another
it
was
not
because
some
of
them
were
produced
by
the
united
influence
of
some
springs
which
did
not
contribute
to
the
production
of
others
for
the
soul
of
man
is
simple
indivisible
and
immaterial
leibniz
owns
it
and
if
he
did
not
acknowledge
it
but
if
on
the
contrary
he
should
suppose
with
most
philosophers
and
some
of
the
most
excellent
metaphysicians
of
our
age
locke
for
instance
that
a
compound
of
several
material
parts
placed
and
disposed
in
a
certain
manner
is
capable
of
thinking
his
hypothesis
would
appear
to
be
on
that
very
ground
absolutely
impossible
and
i
could
refute
it
several
other
ways
which
i
need
not
mention
since
he
acknowledges
the
immateriality
of
our
soul
and
builds
upon
it
us
return
to
the
soul
of
julius
caesar
and
call
it
an
immaterial
automaton
leibniz
own
phrase
and
compare
it
with
an
atom
of
epicurus
i
mean
an
atom
surrounded
with
a
vacuum
on
all
sides
and
which
will
never
meet
any
other
atom
this
is
a
very
just
comparison
for
this
atom
on
the
one
hand
has
a
natural
power
of
moving
itself
and
exerts
it
without
any
assistance
and
without
being
retarded
or
hindered
by
anything
and
on
the
other
hand
the
soul
of
caesar
is
a
spirit
which
has
received
the
faculty
of
producing
thoughts
and
exerts
it
without
the
influence
of
any
other
spirit
or
of
any
body
it
is
neither
assisted
nor
thwarted
by
anything
whatsoever
if
you
consult
the
common
notions
and
the
ideas
of
order
you
will
find
that
this
atom
can
never
stop
and
that
having
been
in
motion
in
the
foregoing
moment
it
will
continue
in
it
at
the
present
moment
and
in
all
the
moments
that
shall
follow
and
that
it
will
always
move
in
the
same
manner
this
is
the
consequence
of
an
axiom
approved
by
leibniz
a
thing
does
always
remain
in
the
same
state
wherein
it
happens
to
be
unless
it
receives
some
alteration
from
some
other
thing
we
says
he
only
that
a
body
which
is
at
rest
will
always
be
at
rest
but
that
a
body
in
motion
will
always
keep
that
motion
or
change
that
is
the
same
swiftness
and
the
same
direction
unless
something
happens
to
hinder
leibniz
ibid
clearly
sees
that
this
atom
whether
it
moves
by
an
innate
power
as
democritus
and
epicurus
would
have
it
or
by
a
power
received
from
the
creator
will
always
move
in
the
same
line
equally
and
after
a
uniform
manner
without
ever
turning
or
going
back
epicurus
was
laughed
at
when
he
invented
the
motion
of
declination
it
was
a
needless
supposition
which
he
wanted
in
order
to
get
out
of
the
labyrinth
of
a
fatal
necessity
and
he
could
give
no
reason
for
this
new
part
of
his
system
it
was
inconsistent
with
the
clearest
notions
of
our
minds
for
it
is
evident
that
an
atom
which
describes
a
straight
line
for
the
space
of
two
days
can
not
turn
away
at
the
beginning
of
a
third
unless
it
meets
with
some
obstacle
or
has
a
mind
all
of
a
sudden
to
go
out
of
its
road
or
contains
some
spring
which
begins
to
play
at
that
very
moment
the
first
of
these
reasons
can
not
be
admitted
in
a
vacuum
the
second
is
impossible
since
an
atom
has
not
the
faculty
of
thinking
and
the
third
is
likewise
impossible
in
a
corpuscle
that
is
a
perfect
unity
i
must
make
some
use
of
all
this
caesar
soul
is
a
being
to
which
unity
belongs
in
a
strict
sense
the
faculty
of
producing
thoughts
is
a
property
of
its
nature
so
leibniz
which
it
has
received
from
god
both
as
to
possession
and
exercise
if
the
first
thought
it
produces
is
a
sense
of
pleasure
there
is
no
reason
why
the
second
should
not
likewise
be
a
sense
of
pleasure
for
when
the
total
cause
of
an
effect
remains
the
same
the
effect
can
not
be
altered
now
this
soul
at
the
second
moment
of
its
existence
does
not
receive
a
new
faculty
of
thinking
it
only
preserves
the
faculty
it
had
at
the
first
moment
and
it
is
as
independent
of
the
concourse
of
any
other
cause
at
the
second
moment
as
it
was
at
the
first
it
must
therefore
produce
again
at
the
second
moment
the
same
thought
it
had
produced
just
before
if
it
be
objected
that
it
ought
to
be
in
a
state
of
change
and
that
it
would
not
be
in
such
a
state
in
the
case
that
i
have
supposed
i
answer
that
its
change
will
be
like
the
change
of
the
atom
for
an
atom
which
continually
moves
in
the
same
line
acquires
a
new
situation
at
every
moment
but
it
is
like
the
preceding
situation
a
soul
may
therefore
continue
in
its
state
of
change
if
it
does
but
produce
a
new
thought
like
the
preceding
suppose
it
to
be
not
confined
within
such
narrow
bounds
it
must
be
granted
at
least
that
its
going
from
one
thought
to
another
implies
some
reason
of
affinity
if
i
suppose
that
in
a
certain
moment
the
soul
of
caesar
sees
a
tree
with
leaves
and
blossoms
i
can
conceive
that
it
does
immediately
desire
to
see
one
that
has
only
leaves
and
then
one
that
has
only
blossoms
and
that
it
will
thus
successively
produce
several
images
arising
from
one
another
but
one
can
not
conceive
the
odd
change
of
thoughts
which
have
no
affinity
with
but
are
even
contrary
to
one
another
and
which
are
so
common
in
men
souls
one
can
not
apprehend
how
god
could
place
in
the
soul
of
julius
caesar
the
principle
of
what
i
am
going
to
say
he
was
without
doubt
pricked
with
a
pin
more
than
once
when
he
was
sucking
and
therefore
according
to
leibniz
hypothesis
which
i
am
here
considering
his
soul
must
have
produced
in
itself
a
sense
of
pain
immediately
after
the
pleasant
sensations
of
the
sweetness
of
the
milk
which
it
had
enjoyed
for
the
space
of
two
or
three
minutes
by
what
springs
was
it
determined
to
interrupt
its
pleasures
and
to
give
itself
all
of
a
sudden
a
sense
of
pain
without
receiving
any
intimation
of
preparing
itself
to
change
and
without
any
new
alteration
in
its
substance
if
you
run
over
the
life
of
that
roman
emperor
every
page
will
afford
you
matter
for
a
stronger
objection
than
this
is
the
thing
would
be
less
incomprehensible
if
it
were
supposed
that
the
soul
of
man
is
not
one
spirit
but
rather
a
multitude
of
spirits
each
of
which
has
its
functions
that
begin
and
end
precisely
as
the
changes
made
in
a
human
body
require
by
virtue
of
this
supposition
it
should
be
said
that
something
analogous
to
a
great
number
of
wheels
and
springs
or
of
matters
that
ferment
disposed
according
to
the
changes
of
our
machine
awakens
or
lulls
asleep
for
a
certain
time
the
action
of
each
of
those
spirits
but
then
the
soul
of
man
would
be
no
longer
a
single
substance
but
an
per
a
collection
and
heap
of
substances
just
like
all
material
beings
we
are
here
in
quest
of
a
single
being
which
produces
in
itself
sometimes
joy
sometimes
pain
and
not
of
many
beings
one
of
which
produces
hope
another
despair
etc
these
observations
i
have
merely
cleared
and
unfolded
those
which
leibniz
has
done
me
the
honour
to
examine
and
now
i
shall
make
some
reflexions
upon
his
answers
he
says
that
law
of
the
change
which
happens
in
the
substance
of
the
animal
transports
him
from
pleasure
to
pain
at
the
very
moment
that
a
solution
of
continuity
is
made
in
his
body
because
the
law
of
the
indivisible
substance
of
that
animal
is
to
represent
what
is
done
in
his
body
as
we
experience
it
and
even
to
represent
in
some
manner
and
with
respect
to
that
body
whatever
is
done
in
the
these
words
are
a
very
good
explication
of
the
grounds
of
this
system
they
are
as
it
were
the
unfolding
and
key
of
it
but
at
the
same
time
they
are
the
very
things
at
which
the
objections
of
those
who
take
this
system
to
be
impossible
are
levelled
the
law
leibniz
speaks
of
supposes
a
decree
of
god
and
shows
wherein
this
system
agrees
with
that
of
occasional
causes
those
two
systems
agree
in
this
point
that
there
are
laws
according
to
which
the
soul
of
man
is
represent
what
is
done
in
the
body
of
man
as
we
experience
but
they
disagree
as
to
the
manner
of
executing
those
laws
the
cartesians
say
that
god
executes
them
leibniz
will
have
it
that
the
soul
itself
does
it
which
appears
to
me
impossible
because
the
soul
has
not
the
necessary
instruments
for
such
an
execution
now
however
infinite
the
power
and
knowledge
of
god
be
he
can
not
perform
with
a
machine
deprived
of
a
certain
piece
what
requires
the
concourse
of
such
a
piece
he
must
supply
that
defect
but
then
the
effect
would
be
produced
by
him
and
not
by
the
machine
i
shall
show
that
the
soul
has
not
the
instruments
requisite
for
the
divine
law
we
speak
of
and
in
order
to
do
it
i
shall
make
use
of
a
comparison
to
yourself
an
animal
created
by
god
and
designed
to
sing
continually
it
will
always
sing
that
is
most
certain
but
if
god
designs
him
a
certain
tablature
he
must
necessarily
either
put
it
before
his
eyes
or
imprint
it
upon
his
memory
or
dispose
his
muscles
in
such
a
manner
that
according
to
the
laws
of
mechanism
one
certain
note
will
always
come
after
another
agreeably
to
the
order
of
the
tablature
without
this
one
can
not
apprehend
that
the
animal
can
always
follow
the
whole
set
of
the
notes
appointed
him
by
god
let
us
apply
this
to
man
soul
leibniz
will
have
it
that
it
has
received
not
only
the
power
of
producing
thoughts
continually
but
also
the
faculty
of
following
always
a
certain
set
of
thoughts
which
answers
the
continual
changes
that
happen
in
the
machine
of
the
body
this
set
of
thoughts
is
like
the
tablature
prescribed
to
the
singing
animal
above
mentioned
can
the
soul
change
its
perceptions
or
modifications
at
every
moment
according
to
such
a
set
of
thoughts
without
knowing
the
series
of
the
notes
and
actually
thinking
upon
them
but
experience
teaches
us
that
it
knows
nothing
of
it
were
it
not
at
least
necessary
that
in
default
of
such
a
knowledge
there
should
be
in
the
soul
a
set
of
particular
instruments
each
of
which
would
be
a
necessary
cause
of
such
and
such
a
thought
must
they
not
be
so
placed
and
disposed
as
to
operate
precisely
one
after
another
according
to
the
correspondence
between
the
changes
of
the
body
and
the
thoughts
of
the
soul
but
it
is
most
certain
that
an
immaterial
simple
and
indivisible
substance
can
not
be
made
up
of
such
an
innumerable
multitude
of
particular
instruments
placed
one
before
another
according
to
the
order
of
the
tablature
in
question
it
is
not
therefore
possible
that
a
human
soul
should
execute
that
law
leibniz
supposes
that
the
soul
does
not
distinctly
know
its
future
perceptions
that
it
perceives
them
and
that
are
in
each
substance
traces
of
whatever
hath
happened
or
shall
happen
to
it
but
that
an
infinite
multitude
of
perceptions
hinders
us
from
distinguishing
them
the
present
state
of
each
substance
is
a
natural
consequence
of
its
preceding
state
the
soul
though
never
so
simple
has
always
a
sentiment
composed
of
several
perceptions
at
one
time
which
answers
our
end
as
well
as
though
it
were
composed
of
pieces
like
a
machine
for
each
foregoing
perception
has
an
influence
on
those
that
follow
agreeably
to
a
law
of
order
which
is
in
perceptions
as
well
as
in
motions
the
perceptions
that
are
together
in
one
and
the
same
soul
at
the
same
time
including
an
infinite
multitude
of
little
and
indistinguishable
sentiments
that
are
to
be
unfolded
we
need
not
wonder
at
the
infinite
variety
of
what
is
to
result
from
it
in
time
this
is
only
a
consequence
of
the
representative
nature
of
the
soul
which
is
to
express
what
happens
and
what
will
happen
in
its
body
by
the
connexion
and
correspondence
of
all
the
parts
of
the
i
have
but
little
to
say
in
answer
to
this
i
shall
only
observe
that
this
supposition
when
sufficiently
cleared
is
the
right
way
of
solving
all
the
difficulties
leibniz
through
the
penetration
of
his
great
genius
has
very
well
conceived
the
extent
and
strength
of
this
objection
and
what
remedy
ought
to
be
applied
to
the
main
inconveniency
i
do
not
doubt
but
that
he
will
smooth
the
rough
parts
of
his
system
and
teach
us
some
excellent
things
about
the
nature
of
spirits
nobody
can
travel
more
usefully
or
more
safely
than
he
in
the
intellectual
world
i
hope
that
his
curious
explanations
will
remove
all
the
impossibilities
which
i
have
hitherto
found
in
his
system
and
that
he
will
solidly
remove
my
difficulties
as
well
as
those
of
father
lami
and
these
hopes
made
me
say
before
without
designing
to
pass
a
compliment
upon
that
learned
man
that
his
system
ought
to
be
looked
upon
as
an
important
conquest
will
not
be
much
embarrassed
by
this
viz
that
whereas
according
to
the
supposition
of
the
cartesians
there
is
but
one
general
law
for
the
union
of
spirits
and
bodies
he
will
have
it
that
god
gives
a
particular
law
to
each
spirit
from
whence
it
seems
to
result
that
the
primitive
constitution
of
each
spirit
is
specifically
different
from
all
others
do
not
the
thomists
say
that
there
are
as
many
species
as
individuals
in
angelic
nature
leibniz
acknowledged
bayle
note
in
a
further
reply
which
is
written
as
though
for
publication
it
was
communicated
to
bayle
but
it
was
not
in
fact
published
it
is
dated
it
may
be
found
in
the
standard
collections
of
leibniz
philosophical
works
it
reads
almost
like
a
sketch
for
the
the
principal
point
developed
by
leibniz
is
the
richness
of
content
which
according
to
him
is
to
be
found
in
each
substance
its
simplicity
is
more
like
the
infinitely
rich
simplicity
of
the
divine
being
than
like
the
simplicity
of
the
atom
of
epicurus
with
which
bayle
had
chosen
to
compare
it
it
contains
a
condensation
in
confused
idea
of
the
whole
universe
and
its
essence
is
from
the
first
defined
by
the
part
it
is
to
play
in
the
total
harmony
as
to
the
musical
score
of
notes
which
the
individual
soul
plays
from
in
order
to
perform
its
ordained
part
in
the
universal
harmony
this
is
to
be
found
in
the
confused
or
implicit
ideas
at
any
moment
present
from
which
an
omniscient
observer
could
always
deduce
what
is
to
happen
next
to
the
objection
the
created
soul
is
not
an
omniscient
observer
and
if
it
can
not
read
the
score
the
score
is
useless
to
it
leibniz
replies
by
affirming
that
much
spontaneous
action
arises
from
subjective
and
yet
unperceived
reasons
as
we
are
all
perfectly
aware
once
we
attend
to
the
relevant
facts
all
he
claims
to
be
doing
is
to
generalize
this
observation
all
events
whatsoever
arise
from
the
of
the
score
by
monads
but
very
little
of
this
is
in
the
least
conscious
leibniz
passes
from
the
remarks
about
his
own
doctrine
under
the
article
to
other
articles
of
bayle
dictionary
and
touches
the
question
of
the
origin
of
evil
and
other
matters
which
receive
their
fuller
treatment
in
the
in
the
same
year
leibniz
wrote
a
very
friendly
letter
to
bayle
himself
offering
further
explanations
of
disputed
points
he
concluded
it
with
a
paragraph
of
some
personal
interest
comparing
himself
the
with
bayle
the
philosophic
lexicographer
and
revealing
by
the
way
his
attitude
to
philosophy
science
and
history
have
good
reason
to
admire
sir
the
way
in
which
your
striking
reflexions
on
the
deepest
questions
of
philosophy
remain
unhindered
by
your
boundless
researches
into
matters
of
fact
i
too
am
not
always
able
to
excuse
myself
from
discussions
of
the
sort
and
have
even
been
obliged
to
descend
to
questions
of
genealogy
which
would
be
still
more
trifling
were
it
not
that
the
interests
of
states
frequently
depend
upon
them
i
have
worked
much
on
the
history
of
germany
in
so
far
as
it
bears
upon
these
countries
a
study
which
has
furnished
me
with
some
observations
belonging
to
general
history
so
i
have
learnt
not
to
neglect
the
knowledge
of
sheer
facts
but
if
the
choice
were
open
to
me
i
should
prefer
natural
history
to
political
and
the
customs
and
laws
god
has
established
in
nature
to
what
is
observed
among
mankind
leibniz
now
conceived
the
idea
of
putting
together
all
the
passages
in
bayle
works
which
interested
him
and
writing
a
systematic
answer
to
them
before
he
had
leisure
to
finish
the
task
bayle
died
the
work
nevertheless
appeared
in
as
the
essays
in
preface
it
has
ever
been
seen
that
men
in
general
have
resorted
to
outward
forms
for
the
expression
of
their
religion
sound
piety
that
is
to
say
light
and
virtue
has
never
been
the
portion
of
the
many
one
should
not
wonder
at
this
nothing
is
so
much
in
accord
with
human
weakness
we
are
impressed
by
what
is
outward
while
the
inner
essence
of
things
requires
consideration
of
such
a
kind
as
few
persons
are
fitted
to
give
as
true
piety
consists
in
principles
and
practice
the
outward
forms
of
religion
imitate
these
and
are
of
two
kinds
the
one
kind
consists
in
ceremonial
practices
and
the
other
in
the
formularies
of
belief
ceremonies
resemble
virtuous
actions
and
formularies
are
like
shadows
of
the
truth
and
approach
more
or
less
the
true
light
all
these
outward
forms
would
be
commendable
if
those
who
invented
them
had
rendered
them
appropriate
to
maintain
and
to
express
that
which
they
imitate
if
religious
ceremonies
ecclesiastical
discipline
the
rules
of
communities
human
laws
were
always
like
a
hedge
round
the
divine
law
to
withdraw
us
from
any
approach
to
vice
to
inure
us
to
the
good
and
to
make
us
familiar
with
virtue
that
was
the
aim
of
moses
and
of
other
good
lawgivers
of
the
wise
men
who
founded
religious
orders
and
above
all
of
jesus
christ
divine
founder
of
the
purest
and
most
enlightened
religion
it
is
just
the
same
with
the
formularies
of
belief
they
would
be
valid
provided
there
were
nothing
in
them
inconsistent
with
truth
unto
salvation
even
though
the
full
truth
concerned
were
not
there
but
it
happens
only
too
often
that
religion
is
choked
in
ceremonial
and
that
the
divine
light
is
obscured
by
the
opinions
of
men
the
pagans
who
inhabited
the
earth
before
christianity
was
founded
had
only
one
kind
of
outward
form
they
had
ceremonies
in
their
worship
but
they
had
no
articles
of
faith
and
had
never
dreamed
of
drawing
up
formularies
for
their
dogmatic
theology
they
knew
not
whether
their
gods
were
real
persons
or
symbols
of
the
forces
of
nature
as
the
sun
the
planets
the
elements
their
mysteries
consisted
not
in
difficult
dogmas
but
in
certain
secret
observances
whence
the
profane
namely
those
who
were
not
initiated
were
excluded
these
observances
were
very
often
ridiculous
and
absurd
and
it
was
necessary
to
conceal
them
in
order
to
guard
them
against
contempt
the
pagans
had
their
superstitions
they
boasted
of
miracles
everything
with
them
was
full
of
oracles
auguries
portents
divinations
the
priests
invented
signs
of
the
anger
or
of
the
goodness
of
the
gods
whose
interpreters
they
claimed
to
be
this
tended
to
sway
minds
through
fear
and
hope
concerning
human
events
but
the
great
future
of
another
life
was
scarce
envisaged
one
did
not
trouble
to
impart
to
men
true
notions
of
god
and
of
the
soul
of
all
ancient
peoples
it
appears
that
the
hebrews
alone
had
public
dogmas
for
their
religion
abraham
and
moses
established
the
belief
in
one
god
source
of
all
good
author
of
all
things
the
hebrews
speak
of
him
in
a
manner
worthy
of
the
supreme
substance
and
one
wonders
at
seeing
the
inhabitants
of
one
small
region
of
the
earth
more
enlightened
than
the
rest
of
the
human
race
peradventure
the
wise
men
of
other
nations
have
sometimes
said
the
same
but
they
have
not
had
the
good
fortune
to
find
a
sufficient
following
and
to
convert
the
dogma
into
law
nevertheless
moses
had
not
inserted
in
his
laws
the
doctrine
of
the
immortality
of
souls
it
was
consistent
with
his
ideas
it
was
taught
by
oral
tradition
but
it
was
not
proclaimed
for
popular
acceptance
until
jesus
christ
lifted
the
veil
and
without
having
force
in
his
hand
taught
with
all
the
force
of
a
lawgiver
that
immortal
souls
pass
into
another
life
wherein
they
shall
receive
the
wages
of
their
deeds
moses
had
already
expressed
the
beautiful
conceptions
of
the
greatness
and
the
goodness
of
god
whereto
many
civilized
peoples
assent
but
jesus
christ
demonstrated
fully
the
results
of
these
ideas
proclaiming
that
divine
goodness
and
justice
are
shown
forth
to
perfection
in
god
designs
for
the
souls
of
men
i
refrain
from
considering
here
the
other
points
of
the
christian
doctrine
and
i
will
show
only
how
jesus
christ
brought
about
the
conversion
of
natural
religion
into
law
and
gained
for
it
the
authority
of
a
public
dogma
he
alone
did
that
which
so
many
philosophers
had
endeavoured
in
vain
to
do
and
christians
having
at
last
gained
the
upper
hand
in
the
roman
empire
the
master
of
the
greater
part
of
the
known
earth
the
religion
of
the
wise
men
became
that
of
the
nations
later
also
mahomet
showed
no
divergence
from
the
great
dogmas
of
natural
theology
his
followers
spread
them
abroad
even
among
the
most
remote
races
of
asia
and
of
africa
whither
christianity
had
not
been
carried
and
they
abolished
in
many
countries
heathen
superstitions
which
were
contrary
to
the
true
doctrine
of
the
unity
of
god
and
the
immortality
of
souls
it
is
clear
that
jesus
christ
completing
what
moses
had
begun
wished
that
the
divinity
should
be
the
object
not
only
of
our
fear
and
veneration
but
also
of
our
love
and
devotion
thus
he
made
men
happy
by
anticipation
and
gave
them
here
on
earth
a
foretaste
of
future
felicity
for
there
is
nothing
so
agreeable
as
loving
that
which
is
worthy
of
love
love
is
that
mental
state
which
makes
us
take
pleasure
in
the
perfections
of
the
object
of
our
love
and
there
is
nothing
more
perfect
than
god
nor
any
greater
delight
than
in
him
to
love
him
it
suffices
to
contemplate
his
perfections
a
thing
easy
indeed
because
we
find
the
ideas
of
these
within
ourselves
the
perfections
of
god
are
those
of
our
souls
but
he
possesses
them
in
boundless
measure
he
is
an
ocean
whereof
to
us
only
drops
have
been
granted
there
is
in
us
some
power
some
knowledge
some
goodness
but
in
god
they
are
all
in
their
entirety
order
proportions
harmony
delight
us
painting
and
music
are
samples
of
these
god
is
all
order
he
always
keeps
truth
of
proportions
he
makes
universal
harmony
all
beauty
is
an
effusion
of
his
rays
it
follows
manifestly
that
true
piety
and
even
true
felicity
consist
in
the
love
of
god
but
a
love
so
enlightened
that
its
fervour
is
attended
by
insight
this
kind
of
love
begets
that
pleasure
in
good
actions
which
gives
relief
to
virtue
and
relating
all
to
god
as
to
the
centre
transports
the
human
to
the
divine
for
in
doing
one
duty
in
obeying
reason
one
carries
out
the
orders
of
supreme
reason
one
directs
all
one
intentions
to
the
common
good
which
is
no
other
than
the
glory
of
god
thus
one
finds
that
there
is
no
greater
individual
interest
than
to
espouse
that
of
the
community
and
one
gains
satisfaction
for
oneself
by
taking
pleasure
in
the
acquisition
of
true
benefits
for
men
whether
one
succeeds
therein
or
not
one
is
content
with
what
comes
to
pass
being
once
resigned
to
the
will
of
god
and
knowing
that
what
he
wills
is
best
but
before
he
declares
his
will
by
the
event
one
endeavours
to
find
it
out
by
doing
that
which
appears
most
in
accord
with
his
commands
when
we
are
in
this
state
of
mind
we
are
not
disheartened
by
ill
success
we
regret
only
our
faults
and
the
ungrateful
ways
of
men
cause
no
relaxation
in
the
exercise
of
our
kindly
disposition
our
charity
is
humble
and
full
of
moderation
it
presumes
not
to
domineer
attentive
alike
to
our
own
faults
and
to
the
talents
of
others
we
are
inclined
to
criticize
our
own
actions
and
to
excuse
and
vindicate
those
of
others
we
must
work
out
our
own
perfection
and
do
wrong
to
no
man
there
is
no
piety
where
there
is
not
charity
and
without
being
kindly
and
beneficent
one
can
not
show
sincere
religion
good
disposition
favourable
upbringing
association
with
pious
and
virtuous
persons
may
contribute
much
towards
such
a
propitious
condition
for
our
souls
but
most
securely
are
they
grounded
therein
by
good
principles
i
have
already
said
that
insight
must
be
joined
to
fervour
that
the
perfecting
of
our
understanding
must
accomplish
the
perfecting
of
our
will
the
practices
of
virtue
as
well
as
those
of
vice
may
be
the
effect
of
a
mere
habit
one
may
acquire
a
taste
for
them
but
when
virtue
is
reasonable
when
it
is
related
to
god
who
is
the
supreme
reason
of
things
it
is
founded
on
knowledge
one
can
not
love
god
without
knowing
his
perfections
and
this
knowledge
contains
the
principles
of
true
piety
the
purpose
of
religion
should
be
to
imprint
these
principles
upon
our
souls
but
in
some
strange
way
it
has
happened
all
too
often
that
men
that
teachers
of
religion
have
strayed
far
from
this
purpose
contrary
to
the
intention
of
our
divine
master
devotion
has
been
reduced
to
ceremonies
and
doctrine
has
been
cumbered
with
formulae
all
too
often
these
ceremonies
have
not
been
well
fitted
to
maintain
the
exercise
of
virtue
and
the
formulae
sometimes
have
not
been
lucid
can
one
believe
it
some
christians
have
imagined
that
they
could
be
devout
without
loving
their
neighbour
and
pious
without
loving
god
or
else
people
have
thought
that
they
could
love
their
neighbour
without
serving
him
and
could
love
god
without
knowing
him
many
centuries
have
passed
without
recognition
of
this
defect
by
the
people
at
large
and
there
are
still
great
traces
of
the
reign
of
darkness
there
are
divers
persons
who
speak
much
of
piety
of
devotion
of
religion
who
are
even
busied
with
the
teaching
of
such
things
and
who
yet
prove
to
be
by
no
means
versed
in
the
divine
perfections
they
ill
understand
the
goodness
and
the
justice
of
the
sovereign
of
the
universe
they
imagine
a
god
who
deserves
neither
to
be
imitated
nor
to
be
loved
this
indeed
seemed
to
me
dangerous
in
its
effect
since
it
is
of
serious
moment
that
the
very
source
of
piety
should
be
preserved
from
infection
the
old
errors
of
those
who
arraigned
the
divinity
or
who
made
thereof
an
evil
principle
have
been
renewed
sometimes
in
our
own
days
people
have
pleaded
the
irresistible
power
of
god
when
it
was
a
question
rather
of
presenting
his
supreme
goodness
and
they
have
assumed
a
despotic
power
when
they
should
rather
have
conceived
of
a
power
ordered
by
the
most
perfect
wisdom
i
have
observed
that
these
opinions
apt
to
do
harm
rested
especially
on
confused
notions
which
had
been
formed
concerning
freedom
necessity
and
destiny
and
i
have
taken
up
my
pen
more
than
once
on
such
an
occasion
to
give
explanations
on
these
important
matters
but
finally
i
have
been
compelled
to
gather
up
my
thoughts
on
all
these
connected
questions
and
to
impart
them
to
the
public
it
is
this
that
i
have
undertaken
in
the
essays
which
i
offer
here
on
the
goodness
of
god
the
freedom
of
man
and
the
origin
of
evil
there
are
two
famous
labyrinths
where
our
reason
very
often
goes
astray
one
concerns
the
great
question
of
the
free
and
the
necessary
above
all
in
the
production
and
the
origin
of
evil
the
other
consists
in
the
discussion
of
continuity
and
of
the
indivisibles
which
appear
to
be
the
elements
thereof
and
where
the
consideration
of
the
infinite
must
enter
in
the
first
perplexes
almost
all
the
human
race
the
other
exercises
philosophers
only
i
shall
have
perchance
at
another
time
an
opportunity
to
declare
myself
on
the
second
and
to
point
out
that
for
lack
of
a
true
conception
of
the
nature
of
substance
and
matter
people
have
taken
up
false
positions
leading
to
insurmountable
difficulties
difficulties
which
should
properly
be
applied
to
the
overthrow
of
these
very
positions
but
if
the
knowledge
of
continuity
is
important
for
speculative
enquiry
that
of
necessity
is
none
the
less
so
for
practical
application
and
it
together
with
the
questions
therewith
connected
to
wit
the
freedom
of
man
and
the
justice
of
god
forms
the
object
of
this
treatise
men
have
been
perplexed
in
every
age
by
a
sophism
which
the
ancients
called
the
reason
because
it
tended
towards
doing
nothing
or
at
least
towards
being
careful
for
nothing
and
only
following
inclination
for
the
pleasure
of
the
moment
for
they
said
if
the
future
is
necessary
that
which
must
happen
will
happen
whatever
i
may
do
now
the
future
so
they
said
is
necessary
whether
because
the
divinity
foresees
everything
and
even
it
by
the
control
of
all
things
in
the
universe
or
because
everything
happens
of
necessity
through
the
concatenation
of
causes
or
finally
through
the
very
nature
of
truth
which
is
determinate
in
the
assertions
that
can
be
made
on
future
events
as
it
is
in
all
assertions
since
the
assertion
must
always
be
true
or
false
in
itself
even
though
we
know
not
always
which
it
is
and
all
these
reasons
for
determination
which
appear
different
converge
finally
like
lines
upon
one
and
the
same
centre
for
there
is
a
truth
in
the
future
event
which
is
predetermined
by
the
causes
and
god
it
in
establishing
the
causes
the
false
conception
of
necessity
being
applied
in
practice
has
given
rise
to
what
i
call
fate
after
the
turkish
fashion
because
it
is
said
of
the
turks
that
they
do
not
shun
danger
or
even
abandon
places
infected
with
plague
owing
to
their
use
of
such
reasoning
as
that
just
recorded
for
what
is
called
was
not
so
black
as
it
is
painted
it
did
not
divert
men
from
the
care
of
their
affairs
but
it
tended
to
give
them
tranquillity
in
regard
to
events
through
the
consideration
of
necessity
which
renders
our
anxieties
and
our
vexations
needless
in
which
respect
these
philosophers
were
not
far
removed
from
the
teaching
of
our
lord
who
deprecates
these
anxieties
in
regard
to
the
morrow
comparing
them
with
the
needless
trouble
a
man
would
give
himself
in
labouring
to
increase
his
stature
it
is
true
that
the
teachings
of
the
stoics
and
perhaps
also
of
some
famous
philosophers
of
our
time
confining
themselves
to
this
alleged
necessity
can
only
impart
a
forced
patience
whereas
our
lord
inspires
thoughts
more
sublime
and
even
instructs
us
in
the
means
of
gaining
contentment
by
assuring
us
that
since
god
being
altogether
good
and
wise
has
care
for
everything
even
so
far
as
not
to
neglect
one
hair
of
our
head
our
confidence
in
him
ought
to
be
entire
and
thus
we
should
see
if
we
were
capable
of
understanding
him
that
it
is
not
even
possible
to
wish
for
anything
better
as
much
in
general
as
for
ourselves
than
what
he
does
it
is
as
if
one
said
to
men
do
your
duty
and
be
content
with
that
which
shall
come
of
it
not
only
because
you
can
not
resist
divine
providence
or
the
nature
of
things
which
may
suffice
for
tranquillity
but
not
for
contentment
but
also
because
you
have
to
do
with
a
good
master
and
that
is
what
may
be
called
nevertheless
it
happens
that
most
men
and
even
christians
introduce
into
their
dealings
some
mixture
of
fate
after
the
turkish
fashion
although
they
do
not
sufficiently
acknowledge
it
it
is
true
that
they
are
not
inactive
or
negligent
when
obvious
perils
or
great
and
manifest
hopes
present
themselves
for
they
will
not
fail
to
abandon
a
house
that
is
about
to
fall
and
to
turn
aside
from
a
precipice
they
see
in
their
path
and
they
will
burrow
in
the
earth
to
dig
up
a
treasure
half
uncovered
without
waiting
for
fate
to
finish
dislodging
it
but
when
the
good
or
the
evil
is
remote
and
uncertain
and
the
remedy
painful
or
little
to
our
taste
the
lazy
reason
seems
to
us
to
be
valid
for
example
when
it
is
a
question
of
preserving
one
health
and
even
one
life
by
good
diet
people
to
whom
one
gives
advice
thereupon
very
often
answer
that
our
days
are
numbered
and
that
it
avails
nothing
to
try
to
struggle
against
that
which
god
destines
for
us
but
these
same
persons
run
to
even
the
most
absurd
remedies
when
the
evil
they
had
neglected
draws
near
one
reasons
in
somewhat
the
same
way
when
the
question
for
consideration
is
somewhat
thorny
as
for
instance
when
one
asks
oneself
vitae
sectabor
what
profession
one
must
choose
when
it
is
a
question
of
a
marriage
being
arranged
of
a
war
being
undertaken
of
a
battle
being
fought
for
in
these
cases
many
will
be
inclined
to
evade
the
difficulty
of
consideration
and
abandon
themselves
to
fate
or
to
inclination
as
if
reason
should
not
be
employed
except
in
easy
cases
one
will
then
all
too
often
reason
in
the
turkish
fashion
although
this
way
is
wrongly
termed
trusting
in
providence
a
thing
that
in
reality
occurs
only
when
one
has
done
one
duty
and
one
will
employ
the
lazy
reason
derived
from
the
idea
of
inevitable
fate
to
relieve
oneself
of
the
need
to
reason
properly
one
will
thus
overlook
the
fact
that
if
this
argument
contrary
to
the
practice
of
reason
were
valid
it
would
always
hold
good
whether
the
consideration
were
easy
or
not
this
laziness
is
to
some
extent
the
source
of
the
superstitious
practices
of
which
meet
with
just
such
credulity
as
men
show
towards
the
stone
because
they
would
fain
have
short
cuts
to
the
attainment
of
happiness
without
trouble
i
do
not
speak
here
of
those
who
throw
themselves
upon
fortune
because
they
have
been
happy
before
as
if
there
were
something
permanent
therein
their
argument
from
the
past
to
the
future
has
just
as
slight
a
foundation
as
the
principles
of
astrology
and
of
other
kinds
of
divination
they
overlook
the
fact
that
there
is
usually
an
ebb
and
flow
in
fortune
as
italians
playing
basset
are
wont
to
call
it
with
regard
to
this
they
make
their
own
particular
observations
which
i
would
nevertheless
counsel
none
to
trust
too
much
yet
this
confidence
that
people
have
in
their
fortune
serves
often
to
give
courage
to
men
and
above
all
to
soldiers
and
causes
them
to
have
indeed
that
good
fortune
they
ascribe
to
themselves
even
so
do
predictions
often
cause
that
to
happen
which
has
been
foretold
as
it
is
supposed
that
the
opinion
the
mahometans
hold
on
fate
makes
them
resolute
thus
even
errors
have
their
use
at
times
but
generally
as
providing
a
remedy
for
other
errors
and
truth
is
unquestionably
better
but
it
is
taking
an
unfair
advantage
of
this
alleged
necessity
of
fate
to
employ
it
in
excuse
for
our
vices
and
our
libertinism
i
have
often
heard
it
said
by
smart
young
persons
who
wished
to
play
the
freethinker
that
it
is
useless
to
preach
virtue
to
censure
vice
to
create
hopes
of
reward
and
fears
of
punishment
since
it
may
be
said
of
the
book
of
destiny
that
what
is
written
is
written
and
that
our
behaviour
can
change
nothing
therein
thus
they
would
say
it
were
best
to
follow
one
inclination
dwelling
only
upon
such
things
as
may
content
us
in
the
present
they
did
not
reflect
upon
the
strange
consequences
of
this
argument
which
would
prove
too
much
since
it
would
prove
for
instance
that
one
should
take
a
pleasant
beverage
even
though
one
knows
it
is
poisoned
for
the
same
reason
if
it
were
valid
i
could
say
if
it
is
written
in
the
records
of
the
parcae
that
poison
will
kill
me
now
or
will
do
me
harm
this
will
happen
even
though
i
were
not
to
take
this
beverage
and
if
this
is
not
written
it
will
not
happen
even
though
i
should
take
this
same
beverage
consequently
i
shall
be
able
to
follow
with
impunity
my
inclination
to
take
what
is
pleasing
however
injurious
it
may
be
the
result
of
which
reasoning
is
an
obvious
absurdity
this
objection
disconcerted
them
a
little
but
they
always
reverted
to
their
argument
phrased
in
different
ways
until
they
were
brought
to
understand
where
the
fault
of
the
sophism
lies
it
is
untrue
that
the
event
happens
whatever
one
may
do
it
will
happen
because
one
does
what
leads
thereto
and
if
the
event
is
written
beforehand
the
cause
that
will
make
it
happen
is
written
also
thus
the
connexion
of
effects
and
causes
so
far
from
establishing
the
doctrine
of
a
necessity
detrimental
to
conduct
serves
to
overthrow
it
yet
without
having
evil
intentions
inclined
towards
libertinism
one
may
envisage
differently
the
strange
consequences
of
an
inevitable
necessity
considering
that
it
would
destroy
the
freedom
of
the
will
so
essential
to
the
morality
of
action
for
justice
and
injustice
praise
and
blame
punishment
and
reward
can
not
attach
to
necessary
actions
and
nobody
will
be
under
obligation
to
do
the
impossible
or
to
abstain
from
doing
what
is
absolutely
necessary
without
any
intention
of
abusing
this
consideration
in
order
to
favour
irregularity
one
will
nevertheless
not
escape
embarrassment
sometimes
when
it
comes
to
a
question
of
judging
the
actions
of
others
or
rather
of
answering
objections
amongst
which
there
are
some
even
concerned
with
the
actions
of
god
whereof
i
will
speak
presently
and
as
an
insuperable
necessity
would
open
the
door
to
impiety
whether
through
the
impunity
one
could
thence
infer
or
the
hopelessness
of
any
attempt
to
resist
a
torrent
that
sweeps
everything
along
with
it
it
is
important
to
note
the
different
degrees
of
necessity
and
to
show
that
there
are
some
which
can
not
do
harm
as
there
are
others
which
can
not
be
admitted
without
giving
rise
to
evil
consequences
some
go
even
further
not
content
with
using
the
pretext
of
necessity
to
prove
that
virtue
and
vice
do
neither
good
nor
ill
they
have
the
hardihood
to
make
the
divinity
accessary
to
their
licentious
way
of
life
and
they
imitate
the
pagans
of
old
who
ascribed
to
the
gods
the
cause
of
their
crimes
as
if
a
divinity
drove
them
to
do
evil
the
philosophy
of
christians
which
recognizes
better
than
that
of
the
ancients
the
dependence
of
things
upon
the
first
author
and
his
with
all
the
actions
of
creatures
appears
to
have
increased
this
difficulty
some
able
men
in
our
own
time
have
gone
so
far
as
to
deny
all
action
to
creatures
and
bayle
who
tended
a
little
towards
this
extraordinary
opinion
made
use
of
it
to
restore
the
lapsed
dogma
of
the
two
principles
or
two
gods
the
one
good
the
other
evil
as
if
this
dogma
were
a
better
solution
to
the
difficulties
over
the
origin
of
evil
yet
again
he
acknowledges
that
it
is
an
indefensible
opinion
and
that
the
oneness
of
the
principle
is
incontestably
founded
on
reasons
but
he
wishes
to
infer
that
our
reason
is
confounded
and
can
not
meet
her
own
objections
and
that
one
should
disregard
them
and
hold
fast
the
revealed
dogmas
which
teach
us
the
existence
of
one
god
altogether
good
altogether
powerful
and
altogether
wise
but
many
readers
convinced
of
the
irrefutable
nature
of
his
objections
and
believing
them
to
be
at
least
as
strong
as
the
proofs
for
the
truth
of
religion
would
draw
dangerous
conclusions
even
though
there
were
no
by
god
in
evil
actions
one
could
not
help
finding
difficulty
in
the
fact
that
he
foresees
them
and
that
being
able
to
prevent
them
through
his
omnipotence
he
yet
permits
them
this
is
why
some
philosophers
and
even
some
theologians
have
rather
chosen
to
deny
to
god
any
knowledge
of
the
detail
of
things
and
above
all
of
future
events
than
to
admit
what
they
believed
repellent
to
his
goodness
the
socinians
and
conrad
vorstius
lean
towards
that
side
and
thomas
bonartes
an
english
jesuit
disguised
under
a
pseudonym
but
exceedingly
learned
who
wrote
a
book
concordia
scientiae
cum
of
which
i
will
speak
later
appears
to
hint
at
this
also
they
are
doubtless
much
mistaken
but
others
are
not
less
so
who
convinced
that
nothing
comes
to
pass
save
by
the
will
and
the
power
of
god
ascribe
to
him
intentions
and
actions
so
unworthy
of
the
greatest
and
the
best
of
all
beings
that
one
would
say
these
authors
have
indeed
renounced
the
dogma
which
recognizes
god
justice
and
goodness
they
thought
that
being
supreme
master
of
the
universe
he
could
without
any
detriment
to
his
holiness
cause
sins
to
be
committed
simply
at
his
will
and
pleasure
or
in
order
that
he
might
have
the
pleasure
of
punishing
and
even
that
he
could
take
pleasure
in
eternally
afflicting
innocent
people
without
doing
any
injustice
because
no
one
has
the
right
or
the
power
to
control
his
actions
some
even
have
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
god
acts
thus
indeed
and
on
the
plea
that
we
are
as
nothing
in
comparison
with
him
they
liken
us
to
earthworms
which
men
crush
without
heeding
as
they
walk
or
in
general
to
animals
that
are
not
of
our
species
and
which
we
do
not
scruple
to
i
believe
that
many
persons
otherwise
of
good
intentions
are
misled
by
these
ideas
because
they
have
not
sufficient
knowledge
of
their
consequences
they
do
not
see
that
properly
speaking
god
justice
is
thus
overthrown
for
what
idea
shall
we
form
of
such
a
justice
as
has
only
will
for
its
rule
that
is
to
say
where
the
will
is
not
guided
by
the
rules
of
good
and
even
tends
directly
towards
evil
unless
it
be
the
idea
contained
in
that
tyrannical
definition
by
thrasymachus
in
plato
which
designated
as
that
which
pleases
the
stronger
such
indeed
is
the
position
taken
up
albeit
unwittingly
by
those
who
rest
all
obligation
upon
constraint
and
in
consequence
take
power
as
the
gauge
of
right
but
one
will
soon
abandon
maxims
so
strange
and
so
unfit
to
make
men
good
and
charitable
through
the
imitation
of
god
for
one
will
reflect
that
a
god
who
would
take
pleasure
in
the
misfortune
of
others
can
not
be
distinguished
from
the
evil
principle
of
the
manichaeans
assuming
that
this
principle
had
become
sole
master
of
the
universe
and
that
in
consequence
one
must
attribute
to
the
true
god
sentiments
that
render
him
worthy
to
be
called
the
good
principle
happily
these
extravagant
dogmas
scarce
obtain
any
longer
among
theologians
nevertheless
some
astute
persons
who
are
pleased
to
make
difficulties
revive
them
they
seek
to
increase
our
perplexity
by
uniting
the
controversies
aroused
by
christian
theology
to
the
disputes
of
philosophy
philosophers
have
considered
the
questions
of
necessity
of
freedom
and
of
the
origin
of
evil
theologians
have
added
thereto
those
of
original
sin
of
grace
and
of
predestination
the
original
corruption
of
the
human
race
coming
from
the
first
sin
appears
to
us
to
have
imposed
a
natural
necessity
to
sin
without
the
succour
of
divine
grace
but
necessity
being
incompatible
with
punishment
it
will
be
inferred
that
a
sufficient
grace
ought
to
have
been
given
to
all
men
which
does
not
seem
to
be
in
conformity
with
experience
but
the
difficulty
is
great
above
all
in
relation
to
god
dispositions
for
the
salvation
of
men
there
are
few
saved
or
chosen
therefore
the
choice
of
many
is
not
god
decreed
will
and
since
it
is
admitted
that
those
whom
he
has
chosen
deserve
it
no
more
than
the
rest
and
are
not
even
fundamentally
less
evil
the
goodness
which
they
have
coming
only
from
the
gift
of
god
the
difficulty
is
increased
where
is
then
his
justice
people
will
say
or
at
the
least
where
is
his
goodness
partiality
or
respect
of
persons
goes
against
justice
and
he
who
without
cause
sets
bounds
to
his
goodness
can
not
have
it
in
sufficient
measure
it
is
true
that
those
who
are
not
chosen
are
lost
by
their
own
fault
they
lack
good
will
or
living
faith
but
it
rested
with
god
alone
to
grant
it
them
we
know
that
besides
inward
grace
there
are
usually
outward
circumstances
which
distinguish
men
and
that
training
conversation
example
often
correct
or
corrupt
natural
disposition
now
that
god
should
call
forth
circumstances
favourable
to
some
and
abandon
others
to
experiences
which
contribute
to
their
misfortune
will
not
that
give
us
cause
for
astonishment
and
it
is
not
enough
so
it
seems
to
say
with
some
that
inward
grace
is
universal
and
equal
for
all
for
these
same
authors
are
obliged
to
resort
to
the
exclamations
of
paul
and
to
say
the
depth
when
they
consider
how
men
are
distinguished
by
what
we
may
call
outward
graces
that
is
by
graces
appearing
in
the
diversity
of
circumstances
which
god
calls
forth
whereof
men
are
not
the
masters
and
which
have
nevertheless
so
great
an
influence
upon
all
that
concerns
their
salvation
nor
will
it
help
us
to
say
with
augustine
that
all
men
being
involved
in
the
damnation
caused
by
the
sin
of
adam
god
might
have
left
them
all
in
their
misery
and
that
thus
his
goodness
alone
induces
him
to
deliver
some
of
them
for
not
only
is
it
strange
that
the
sin
of
another
should
condemn
anyone
but
there
still
remains
the
question
why
god
does
not
deliver
all
why
he
delivers
the
lesser
number
and
why
some
in
preference
to
others
he
is
in
truth
their
master
but
he
is
a
good
and
just
master
his
power
is
absolute
but
his
wisdom
permits
not
that
he
exercise
that
power
in
an
arbitrary
and
despotic
way
which
would
be
tyrannous
indeed
moreover
the
fall
of
the
first
man
having
happened
only
with
permission
and
god
having
resolved
to
permit
it
only
when
once
he
had
considered
its
consequences
which
are
the
corruption
of
the
mass
of
the
human
race
and
the
choice
of
a
small
number
of
elect
with
the
abandonment
of
all
the
rest
it
is
useless
to
conceal
the
difficulty
by
limiting
view
to
the
mass
already
corrupt
one
must
in
spite
of
oneself
go
back
to
the
knowledge
of
the
consequences
of
the
first
sin
preceding
the
decree
whereby
god
permitted
it
and
whereby
he
permitted
simultaneously
that
the
damned
should
be
involved
in
the
mass
of
perdition
and
should
not
be
delivered
for
god
and
the
sage
make
no
resolve
without
considering
its
consequences
i
hope
to
remove
all
these
difficulties
i
will
point
out
that
absolute
necessity
which
is
called
also
logical
and
metaphysical
and
sometimes
geometrical
and
which
would
alone
be
formidable
in
this
connexion
does
not
exist
in
free
actions
and
that
thus
freedom
is
exempt
not
only
from
constraint
but
also
from
real
necessity
i
will
show
that
god
himself
although
he
always
chooses
the
best
does
not
act
by
an
absolute
necessity
and
that
the
laws
of
nature
laid
down
by
god
founded
upon
the
fitness
of
things
keep
the
mean
between
geometrical
truths
absolutely
necessary
and
arbitrary
decrees
which
bayle
and
other
modern
philosophers
have
not
sufficiently
understood
further
i
will
show
that
there
is
an
indifference
in
freedom
because
there
is
no
absolute
necessity
for
one
course
or
the
other
but
yet
that
there
is
never
an
indifference
of
perfect
equipoise
and
i
will
demonstrate
that
there
is
in
free
actions
a
perfect
spontaneity
beyond
all
that
has
been
conceived
hitherto
finally
i
will
make
it
plain
that
the
hypothetical
and
the
moral
necessity
which
subsist
in
free
actions
are
open
to
no
objection
and
that
the
reason
is
a
pure
sophism
likewise
concerning
the
origin
of
evil
in
its
relation
to
god
i
offer
a
vindication
of
his
perfections
that
shall
extol
not
less
his
holiness
his
justice
and
his
goodness
than
his
greatness
his
power
and
his
independence
i
show
how
it
is
possible
for
everything
to
depend
upon
god
for
him
to
in
all
the
actions
of
creatures
even
if
you
will
to
create
these
creatures
continually
and
nevertheless
not
to
be
the
author
of
sin
here
also
it
is
demonstrated
how
the
privative
nature
of
evil
should
be
understood
much
more
than
that
i
explain
how
evil
has
a
source
other
than
the
will
of
god
and
that
one
is
right
therefore
to
say
of
moral
evil
that
god
wills
it
not
but
simply
permits
it
most
important
of
all
however
i
show
that
it
has
been
possible
for
god
to
permit
sin
and
misery
and
even
to
therein
and
promote
it
without
detriment
to
his
holiness
and
his
supreme
goodness
although
generally
speaking
he
could
have
avoided
all
these
evils
concerning
grace
and
predestination
i
justify
the
most
debatable
assertions
as
for
instance
that
we
are
converted
only
through
the
prevenient
grace
of
god
and
that
we
can
not
do
good
except
with
his
aid
that
god
wills
the
salvation
of
all
men
and
that
he
condemns
only
those
whose
will
is
evil
that
he
gives
to
all
a
sufficient
grace
provided
they
wish
to
use
it
that
jesus
christ
being
the
source
and
the
centre
of
election
god
destined
the
elect
for
salvation
because
he
foresaw
that
they
would
cling
with
a
lively
faith
to
the
doctrine
of
jesus
christ
yet
it
is
true
that
this
reason
for
election
is
not
the
final
reason
and
that
this
very
is
still
a
consequence
of
god
anterior
decree
faith
likewise
is
a
gift
of
god
who
has
predestinated
the
faith
of
the
elect
for
reasons
lying
in
a
superior
decree
which
dispenses
grace
and
circumstance
in
accordance
with
god
supreme
wisdom
now
as
one
of
the
most
gifted
men
of
our
time
whose
eloquence
was
as
great
as
his
acumen
and
who
gave
great
proofs
of
his
vast
erudition
had
applied
himself
with
a
strange
predilection
to
call
attention
to
all
the
difficulties
on
this
subject
which
i
have
just
touched
in
general
i
found
a
fine
field
for
exercise
in
considering
the
question
with
him
in
detail
i
acknowledge
that
bayle
for
it
is
easy
to
see
that
i
speak
of
him
has
on
his
side
all
the
advantages
except
that
of
the
root
of
the
matter
but
i
hope
that
truth
which
he
acknowledges
himself
to
be
on
our
side
by
its
very
plainness
and
provided
it
be
fittingly
set
forth
will
prevail
over
all
the
ornaments
of
eloquence
and
erudition
my
hope
for
success
therein
is
all
the
greater
because
it
is
the
cause
of
god
i
plead
and
because
one
of
the
maxims
here
upheld
states
that
god
help
is
never
lacking
for
those
that
lack
not
good
will
the
author
of
this
discourse
believes
that
he
has
given
proof
of
this
good
will
in
the
attention
he
has
brought
to
bear
upon
this
subject
he
has
meditated
upon
it
since
his
youth
he
has
conferred
with
some
of
the
foremost
men
of
the
time
and
he
has
schooled
himself
by
the
reading
of
good
authors
and
the
success
which
god
has
given
him
according
to
the
opinion
of
sundry
competent
judges
in
certain
other
profound
meditations
of
which
some
have
much
influence
on
this
subject
gives
him
peradventure
some
right
to
claim
the
attention
of
readers
who
love
truth
and
are
fitted
to
search
after
it
the
author
had
moreover
particular
and
weighty
reasons
inducing
him
to
take
pen
in
hand
for
discussion
of
this
subject
conversations
which
he
had
concerning
the
same
with
literary
and
court
personages
in
germany
and
in
france
and
especially
with
one
of
the
greatest
and
most
accomplished
of
princesses
have
repeatedly
prompted
him
to
this
course
he
had
had
the
honour
of
expressing
his
opinions
to
this
princess
upon
divers
passages
of
the
admirable
of
bayle
wherein
religion
and
reason
appear
as
adversaries
and
where
bayle
wishes
to
silence
reason
after
having
made
it
speak
too
loud
which
he
calls
the
triumph
of
faith
the
present
author
declared
there
and
then
that
he
was
of
a
different
opinion
but
that
he
was
nevertheless
well
pleased
that
a
man
of
such
great
genius
had
brought
about
an
occasion
for
going
deeply
into
these
subjects
subjects
as
important
as
they
are
difficult
he
admitted
having
examined
them
also
for
some
long
time
already
and
having
sometimes
been
minded
to
publish
upon
this
matter
some
reflexions
whose
chief
aim
should
be
such
knowledge
of
god
as
is
needed
to
awaken
piety
and
to
foster
virtue
this
princess
exhorted
and
urged
him
to
carry
out
his
intention
and
some
friends
added
their
persuasions
he
was
all
the
more
tempted
to
accede
to
their
requests
since
he
had
reason
to
hope
that
in
the
sequel
to
his
investigation
bayle
genius
would
greatly
aid
him
to
give
the
subject
such
illumination
as
it
might
receive
with
his
support
but
divers
obstacles
intervened
and
the
death
of
the
incomparable
queen
was
not
the
least
it
happened
however
that
bayle
was
attacked
by
excellent
men
who
set
themselves
to
examine
the
same
subject
he
answered
them
fully
and
always
ingeniously
i
followed
their
dispute
and
was
even
on
the
point
of
being
involved
therein
this
is
how
it
came
about
i
had
published
a
new
system
which
seemed
well
adapted
to
explain
the
union
of
the
soul
and
the
body
it
met
with
considerable
applause
even
from
those
who
were
not
in
agreement
with
it
and
certain
competent
persons
testified
that
they
had
already
been
of
my
opinion
without
having
reached
so
distinct
an
explanation
before
they
saw
what
i
had
written
on
the
matter
bayle
examined
it
in
his
and
critical
article
he
thought
that
my
expositions
were
worthy
of
further
development
he
drew
attention
to
their
usefulness
in
various
connexions
and
he
laid
stress
upon
what
might
still
cause
difficulty
i
could
not
but
reply
in
a
suitable
way
to
expressions
so
civil
and
to
reflexions
so
instructive
as
his
in
order
to
turn
them
to
greater
account
i
published
some
elucidations
in
the
des
ouvrages
des
july
bayle
replied
to
them
in
the
second
edition
of
his
i
sent
him
a
rejoinder
which
has
not
yet
been
published
i
know
not
whether
he
ever
made
a
further
reply
meanwhile
it
happened
that
le
clerc
had
inserted
in
his
an
extract
from
the
of
the
late
cudworth
and
had
explained
therein
certain
natures
which
this
admirable
author
applied
to
the
formation
of
animals
bayle
believed
see
the
continuation
of
thoughts
on
the
ch
art
that
these
natures
being
without
cognition
in
establishing
them
one
weakened
the
argument
which
proves
through
the
marvellous
formation
of
things
that
the
universe
must
have
an
intelligent
cause
le
clerc
replied
art
of
the
vol
of
his
that
these
natures
required
to
be
directed
by
divine
wisdom
bayle
insisted
article
of
the
des
ouvrages
des
august
that
direction
alone
was
not
sufficient
for
a
cause
devoid
of
cognition
unless
one
took
the
cause
to
be
a
mere
instrument
of
god
in
which
case
direction
would
be
needless
my
system
was
touched
upon
in
passing
and
that
gave
me
an
opportunity
to
send
a
short
essay
to
the
illustrious
author
of
the
des
ouvrages
des
which
he
inserted
in
the
month
of
may
art
in
this
i
endeavoured
to
make
clear
that
in
reality
mechanism
is
sufficient
to
produce
the
organic
bodies
of
animals
without
any
need
of
other
plastic
natures
provided
there
be
added
thereto
the
already
completely
organic
in
the
seeds
of
the
bodies
that
come
into
existence
contained
in
those
of
the
bodies
whence
they
spring
right
back
to
the
primary
seeds
this
could
only
proceed
from
the
author
of
things
infinitely
powerful
and
infinitely
wise
who
creating
all
in
the
beginning
in
due
order
had
there
all
order
and
artifice
that
was
to
be
there
is
no
chaos
in
the
inward
nature
of
things
and
there
is
organism
everywhere
in
a
matter
whose
disposition
proceeds
from
god
more
and
more
of
it
would
come
to
light
if
we
pressed
closer
our
examination
of
the
anatomy
of
bodies
and
we
should
continue
to
observe
it
even
if
we
could
go
on
to
infinity
like
nature
and
make
subdivision
as
continuous
in
our
knowledge
as
nature
has
made
it
in
fact
in
order
to
explain
this
marvel
of
the
formation
of
animals
i
made
use
of
a
harmony
that
is
to
say
of
the
same
means
i
had
used
to
explain
another
marvel
namely
the
correspondence
of
soul
with
body
wherein
i
proved
the
uniformity
and
the
fecundity
of
the
principles
i
had
employed
it
seems
that
this
reminded
bayle
of
my
system
of
accounting
for
this
correspondence
which
he
had
examined
formerly
he
declared
in
chapter
of
his
to
the
questions
of
a
vol
iii
that
he
did
not
believe
god
could
give
to
matter
or
to
any
other
cause
the
faculty
of
becoming
organic
without
communicating
to
it
the
idea
and
the
knowledge
of
organic
nature
also
he
was
not
yet
disposed
to
believe
that
god
with
all
his
power
over
nature
and
with
all
the
foreknowledge
which
he
has
of
the
contingencies
that
may
arrive
could
have
so
disposed
things
that
by
the
laws
of
mechanics
alone
a
vessel
for
instance
should
go
to
its
port
of
destination
without
being
steered
during
its
passage
by
some
intelligent
guide
i
was
surprised
to
see
that
limits
were
placed
on
the
power
of
god
without
the
adduction
of
any
proof
and
without
indication
that
there
was
any
contradiction
to
be
feared
on
the
side
of
the
object
or
any
imperfection
on
god
side
whereas
i
had
shown
before
in
my
rejoinder
that
even
men
often
produce
through
automata
something
like
the
movements
that
come
from
reason
and
that
even
a
finite
mind
but
one
far
above
ours
could
accomplish
what
bayle
thinks
impossible
to
the
divinity
moreover
as
god
orders
all
things
at
once
beforehand
the
accuracy
of
the
path
of
this
vessel
would
be
no
more
strange
than
that
of
a
fuse
passing
along
a
cord
in
fireworks
since
the
whole
disposition
of
things
preserves
a
perfect
harmony
between
them
by
means
of
their
influence
one
upon
the
other
this
declaration
of
bayle
pledged
me
to
an
answer
i
therefore
purposed
to
point
out
to
him
that
unless
it
be
said
that
god
forms
organic
bodies
himself
by
a
perpetual
miracle
or
that
he
has
entrusted
this
care
to
intelligences
whose
power
and
knowledge
are
almost
divine
we
must
hold
the
opinion
that
god
things
in
such
sort
that
new
organisms
are
only
a
mechanical
consequence
of
a
preceding
organic
constitution
even
so
do
butterflies
come
out
of
silkworms
an
instance
where
swammerdam
has
shown
that
there
is
nothing
but
development
and
i
would
have
added
that
nothing
is
better
qualified
than
the
preformation
of
plants
and
of
animals
to
confirm
my
system
of
harmony
between
the
soul
and
the
body
for
in
this
the
body
is
prompted
by
its
original
constitution
to
carry
out
with
the
help
of
external
things
all
that
it
does
in
accordance
with
the
will
of
the
soul
so
the
seeds
by
their
original
constitution
carry
out
naturally
the
intentions
of
god
by
an
artifice
greater
still
than
that
which
causes
our
body
to
perform
everything
in
conformity
with
our
will
and
since
bayle
himself
deems
with
reason
that
there
is
more
artifice
in
the
organism
of
animals
than
in
the
most
beautiful
poem
in
the
world
or
in
the
most
admirable
invention
whereof
the
human
mind
is
capable
it
follows
that
my
system
of
the
connexion
between
the
body
and
the
soul
is
as
intelligible
as
the
general
opinion
on
the
formation
of
animals
for
this
opinion
which
appears
to
me
true
states
in
effect
that
the
wisdom
of
god
has
so
made
nature
that
it
is
competent
in
virtue
of
its
laws
to
form
animals
i
explain
this
opinion
and
throw
more
light
upon
the
possibility
of
it
through
the
system
of
preformation
whereafter
there
will
be
no
cause
for
surprise
that
god
has
so
made
the
body
that
by
virtue
of
its
own
laws
it
can
carry
out
the
intentions
of
the
reasoning
soul
for
all
that
the
reasoning
soul
can
demand
of
the
body
is
less
difficult
than
the
organization
which
god
has
demanded
of
the
seeds
bayle
says
to
the
questions
of
a
ch
that
it
is
only
very
recently
there
have
been
people
who
have
understood
that
the
formation
of
living
bodies
can
not
be
a
natural
process
this
he
could
say
also
in
accordance
with
his
principles
of
the
communication
between
the
soul
and
the
body
since
god
effects
this
whole
communication
in
the
system
of
occasional
causes
to
which
this
author
subscribes
but
i
admit
the
supernatural
here
only
in
the
beginning
of
things
in
respect
of
the
first
formation
of
animals
or
in
respect
of
the
original
constitution
of
harmony
between
the
soul
and
the
body
once
that
has
come
to
pass
i
hold
that
the
formation
of
animals
and
the
relation
between
the
soul
and
the
body
are
something
as
natural
now
as
the
other
most
ordinary
operations
of
nature
a
close
parallel
is
afforded
by
people
ordinary
thinking
about
the
instinct
and
the
marvellous
behaviour
of
brutes
one
recognizes
reason
there
not
in
the
brutes
but
in
him
who
created
them
i
am
then
of
the
general
opinion
in
this
respect
but
i
hope
that
my
explanation
will
have
added
clearness
and
lucidity
and
even
a
more
ample
range
to
that
opinion
now
when
preparing
to
justify
my
system
in
face
of
the
new
difficulties
of
bayle
i
purposed
at
the
same
time
to
communicate
to
him
the
ideas
which
i
had
had
for
some
time
already
on
the
difficulties
put
forward
by
him
in
opposition
to
those
who
endeavour
to
reconcile
reason
with
faith
in
regard
to
the
existence
of
evil
indeed
there
are
perhaps
few
persons
who
have
toiled
more
than
i
in
this
matter
hardly
had
i
gained
some
tolerable
understanding
of
latin
writings
when
i
had
an
opportunity
of
turning
over
books
in
a
library
i
flitted
from
book
to
book
and
since
subjects
for
meditation
pleased
me
as
much
as
histories
and
fables
i
was
charmed
by
the
work
of
laurentius
valla
against
boethius
and
by
that
of
luther
against
erasmus
although
i
was
well
aware
that
they
had
need
of
some
mitigation
i
did
not
omit
books
of
controversy
and
amongst
other
writings
of
this
nature
the
records
of
the
montbéliard
conversation
which
had
revived
the
dispute
appeared
to
me
instructive
nor
did
i
neglect
the
teachings
of
our
theologians
and
the
study
of
their
opponents
far
from
disturbing
me
served
to
strengthen
me
in
the
moderate
opinions
of
the
churches
of
the
augsburg
confession
i
had
opportunity
on
my
journeys
to
confer
with
some
excellent
men
of
different
parties
for
instance
with
bishop
peter
von
wallenburg
suffragan
of
mainz
with
herr
johann
ludwig
fabricius
premier
theologian
of
heidelberg
and
finally
with
the
celebrated
arnauld
to
him
i
even
tendered
a
latin
dialogue
of
my
own
composition
upon
this
subject
about
the
year
wherein
already
i
laid
it
down
that
god
having
chosen
the
most
perfect
of
all
possible
worlds
had
been
prompted
by
his
wisdom
to
permit
the
evil
which
was
bound
up
with
it
but
which
still
did
not
prevent
this
world
from
being
all
things
considered
the
best
that
could
be
chosen
i
have
also
since
read
many
and
various
good
authors
on
these
subjects
and
i
have
endeavoured
to
make
progress
in
the
knowledge
that
seems
to
me
proper
for
banishing
all
that
could
have
obscured
the
idea
of
supreme
perfection
which
must
be
acknowledged
in
god
i
have
not
neglected
to
examine
the
most
rigorous
authors
who
have
extended
furthest
the
doctrine
of
the
necessity
of
things
as
for
instance
hobbes
and
spinoza
of
whom
the
former
advocated
this
absolute
necessity
not
only
in
his
and
elsewhere
but
also
in
a
special
book
against
bishop
bramhall
and
spinoza
insists
more
or
less
like
an
ancient
peripatetic
philosopher
named
strato
that
all
has
come
from
the
first
cause
or
from
primitive
nature
by
a
blind
and
geometrical
necessity
with
complete
absence
of
capacity
for
choice
for
goodness
and
for
understanding
in
this
first
source
of
things
i
have
found
the
means
so
it
seems
to
me
of
demonstrating
the
contrary
in
a
way
that
gives
one
a
clear
insight
into
the
inward
essence
of
the
matter
for
having
made
new
discoveries
on
the
nature
of
active
force
and
the
laws
of
motion
i
have
shown
that
they
have
no
geometrical
necessity
as
spinoza
appears
to
have
believed
they
had
neither
as
i
have
made
plain
are
they
purely
arbitrary
even
though
this
be
the
opinion
of
bayle
and
of
some
modern
philosophers
but
they
are
dependent
upon
the
fitness
of
things
as
i
have
already
pointed
out
above
or
upon
that
which
i
call
the
of
the
best
moreover
one
recognizes
therein
as
in
every
other
thing
the
marks
of
the
first
substance
whose
productions
bear
the
stamp
of
a
supreme
wisdom
and
make
the
most
perfect
of
harmonies
i
have
shown
also
that
this
harmony
connects
both
the
future
with
the
past
and
the
present
with
the
absent
the
first
kind
of
connexion
unites
times
and
the
other
places
this
second
connexion
is
displayed
in
the
union
of
the
soul
with
the
body
and
in
general
in
the
communication
of
true
substances
with
one
another
and
with
material
phenomena
but
the
first
takes
place
in
the
preformation
of
organic
bodies
or
rather
of
all
bodies
since
there
is
organism
everywhere
although
all
masses
do
not
compose
organic
bodies
so
a
pond
may
very
well
be
full
of
fish
or
of
other
organic
bodies
although
it
is
not
itself
an
animal
or
organic
body
but
only
a
mass
that
contains
them
thus
i
had
endeavoured
to
build
upon
such
foundations
established
in
a
conclusive
manner
a
complete
body
of
the
main
articles
of
knowledge
that
reason
pure
and
simple
can
impart
to
us
a
body
whereof
all
the
parts
were
properly
connected
and
capable
of
meeting
the
most
important
difficulties
of
the
ancients
and
the
moderns
i
had
also
in
consequence
formed
for
myself
a
certain
system
concerning
the
freedom
of
man
and
the
cooperation
of
god
this
system
appeared
to
me
to
be
such
as
would
in
no
wise
offend
reason
and
faith
and
i
desired
to
submit
it
to
the
scrutiny
of
bayle
as
well
as
of
those
who
are
in
controversy
with
him
now
he
has
departed
from
us
and
such
a
loss
is
no
small
one
a
writer
whose
learning
and
acumen
few
have
equalled
but
since
the
subject
is
under
consideration
and
men
of
talent
are
still
occupied
with
it
while
the
public
also
follows
it
attentively
i
take
this
to
be
a
fitting
moment
for
the
publication
of
certain
of
my
ideas
it
will
perhaps
be
well
to
add
the
observation
before
finishing
this
preface
that
in
denying
the
physical
influence
of
the
soul
upon
the
body
or
of
the
body
upon
the
soul
that
is
an
influence
causing
the
one
to
disturb
the
laws
of
the
other
i
by
no
means
deny
the
union
of
the
one
with
the
other
which
forms
of
them
a
suppositum
but
this
union
is
something
metaphysical
which
changes
nothing
in
the
phenomena
this
is
what
i
have
already
said
in
reply
to
the
objection
raised
against
me
in
the
de
by
the
reverend
father
de
tournemine
whose
wit
and
learning
are
of
no
ordinary
mould
and
for
this
reason
one
may
say
also
in
a
metaphysical
sense
that
the
soul
acts
upon
the
body
and
the
body
upon
the
soul
moreover
it
is
true
that
the
soul
is
the
entelechy
or
the
active
principle
whereas
the
corporeal
alone
or
the
mere
material
contains
only
the
passive
consequently
the
principle
of
action
is
in
the
soul
as
i
have
explained
more
than
once
in
the
more
especially
does
this
appear
in
my
answer
to
the
late
herr
sturm
philosopher
and
mathematician
of
altorf
where
i
have
even
demonstrated
that
if
bodies
contained
only
the
passive
their
different
conditions
would
be
indistinguishable
also
i
take
this
opportunity
to
say
that
having
heard
of
some
objections
made
by
the
gifted
author
of
the
book
on
in
that
same
book
to
my
system
of
harmony
i
sent
a
reply
to
paris
showing
that
he
has
attributed
to
me
opinions
i
am
far
from
holding
on
another
matter
recently
i
met
with
like
treatment
at
the
hands
of
an
anonymous
doctor
of
the
sorbonne
and
these
misconceptions
would
have
become
plain
to
the
reader
at
the
outset
if
my
own
words
which
were
being
taken
in
evidence
had
been
quoted
this
tendency
of
men
to
make
mistakes
in
presenting
the
opinions
of
others
leads
me
to
observe
also
that
when
i
said
somewhere
that
man
helps
himself
in
conversion
through
the
succour
of
grace
i
mean
only
that
he
derives
advantage
from
it
through
the
cessation
of
the
resistance
overcome
but
without
any
cooperation
on
his
part
just
as
there
is
no
in
ice
when
it
is
broken
for
conversion
is
purely
the
work
of
god
grace
wherein
man
only
by
resisting
it
but
human
resistance
is
more
or
less
great
according
to
the
persons
and
the
occasions
circumstances
also
contribute
more
or
less
to
our
attention
and
to
the
motions
that
arise
in
the
soul
and
the
of
all
these
things
together
with
the
strength
of
the
impression
and
the
condition
of
the
will
determines
the
operation
of
grace
although
not
rendering
it
necessary
i
have
expounded
sufficiently
elsewhere
that
in
relation
to
matters
of
salvation
unregenerate
man
is
to
be
considered
as
dead
and
i
greatly
approve
the
manner
wherein
the
theologians
of
the
augsburg
confession
declare
themselves
on
this
subject
yet
this
corruption
of
unregenerate
man
is
it
must
be
added
no
hindrance
to
his
possession
of
true
moral
virtues
and
his
performance
of
good
actions
in
his
civic
life
actions
which
spring
from
a
good
principle
without
any
evil
intention
and
without
mixture
of
actual
sin
wherein
i
hope
i
shall
be
forgiven
if
i
have
dared
to
diverge
from
the
opinion
of
augustine
he
was
doubtless
a
great
man
of
admirable
intelligence
but
inclined
sometimes
as
it
seems
to
exaggerate
things
above
all
in
the
heat
of
his
controversies
i
greatly
esteem
some
persons
who
profess
to
be
disciples
of
augustine
amongst
others
the
reverend
father
quênel
a
worthy
successor
of
the
great
arnauld
in
the
pursuit
of
controversies
that
have
embroiled
them
with
the
most
famous
of
societies
but
i
have
found
that
usually
in
disputes
between
people
of
conspicuous
merit
of
whom
there
are
doubtless
some
here
in
both
parties
there
is
right
on
both
sides
although
in
different
points
and
it
is
rather
in
the
matter
of
defence
than
attack
although
the
natural
malevolence
of
the
human
heart
generally
renders
attack
more
agreeable
to
the
reader
than
defence
i
hope
that
the
reverend
father
ptolemei
who
does
his
society
credit
and
is
occupied
in
filling
the
gaps
left
by
the
famous
bellarmine
will
give
us
concerning
all
of
that
some
explanations
worthy
of
his
acumen
and
his
knowledge
and
i
even
dare
to
add
his
moderation
and
one
must
believe
that
among
the
theologians
of
the
augsburg
confession
there
will
arise
some
new
chemnitz
or
some
new
callixtus
even
as
one
is
justified
in
thinking
that
men
like
usserius
or
daillé
will
again
appear
among
the
reformed
and
that
all
will
work
more
and
more
to
remove
the
misconceptions
wherewith
this
matter
is
charged
for
the
rest
i
shall
be
well
pleased
that
those
who
shall
wish
to
examine
it
closely
read
the
objections
with
the
answers
i
have
given
thereto
formulated
in
the
small
treatise
i
have
placed
at
the
end
of
the
work
by
way
of
summary
i
have
endeavoured
to
forestall
some
new
objections
i
have
explained
for
instance
why
i
have
taken
the
antecedent
and
consequent
will
as
preliminary
and
final
after
the
example
of
thomas
of
scotus
and
others
how
it
is
possible
that
there
be
incomparably
more
good
in
the
glory
of
all
the
saved
than
there
is
evil
in
the
misery
of
all
the
damned
despite
that
there
are
more
of
the
latter
how
in
saying
that
evil
has
been
permitted
as
a
sine
qua
of
good
i
mean
not
according
to
the
principle
of
necessity
but
according
to
the
principle
of
the
fitness
of
things
furthermore
i
show
that
the
predetermination
i
admit
is
such
as
always
to
predispose
but
never
to
necessitate
and
that
god
will
not
refuse
the
requisite
new
light
to
those
who
have
made
a
good
use
of
that
which
they
had
other
elucidations
besides
i
have
endeavoured
to
give
on
some
difficulties
which
have
been
put
before
me
of
late
i
have
moreover
followed
the
advice
of
some
friends
who
thought
it
fitting
that
i
should
add
two
appendices
the
one
treats
of
the
controversy
carried
on
between
hobbes
and
bishop
bramhall
touching
freedom
and
necessity
the
other
of
the
learned
work
on
origin
of
published
a
short
time
ago
in
england
finally
i
have
endeavoured
in
all
things
to
consider
edification
and
if
i
have
conceded
something
to
curiosity
it
is
because
i
thought
it
necessary
to
relieve
a
subject
whose
seriousness
may
cause
discouragement
it
is
with
that
in
view
that
i
have
introduced
into
this
dissertation
the
pleasing
chimera
of
a
certain
astronomical
theology
having
no
ground
for
apprehension
that
it
will
ensnare
anyone
and
deeming
that
to
tell
it
and
refute
it
is
the
same
thing
fiction
for
fiction
instead
of
imagining
that
the
planets
were
suns
one
might
conceive
that
they
were
masses
melted
in
the
sun
and
thrown
out
and
that
would
destroy
the
foundation
of
this
hypothetical
theology
the
ancient
error
of
the
two
principles
which
the
orientals
distinguished
by
the
names
oromasdes
and
arimanius
caused
me
to
explain
a
conjecture
on
the
primitive
history
of
peoples
it
appears
indeed
probable
that
these
were
the
names
of
two
great
contemporary
princes
the
one
monarch
of
a
part
of
upper
asia
where
there
have
since
been
others
of
this
name
the
other
king
of
the
scythian
celts
who
made
incursions
into
the
states
of
the
former
and
who
was
also
named
amongst
the
divinities
of
germania
it
seems
indeed
that
zoroaster
used
the
names
of
these
princes
as
symbols
of
the
invisible
powers
which
their
exploits
made
them
resemble
in
the
ideas
of
asiatics
yet
elsewhere
according
to
the
accounts
of
arab
authors
who
in
this
might
well
be
better
informed
than
the
greeks
it
appears
from
detailed
records
of
ancient
oriental
history
that
this
zerdust
or
zoroaster
whom
they
make
contemporary
with
the
great
darius
did
not
look
upon
these
two
principles
as
completely
primitive
and
independent
but
as
dependent
upon
one
supreme
and
single
principle
they
relate
that
he
believed
in
conformity
with
the
cosmogony
of
moses
that
god
who
is
without
an
equal
created
all
and
separated
the
light
from
the
darkness
that
the
light
conformed
with
his
original
design
but
that
the
darkness
came
as
a
consequence
even
as
the
shadow
follows
the
body
and
that
this
is
nothing
but
privation
such
a
thesis
would
clear
this
ancient
author
of
the
errors
the
greeks
imputed
to
him
his
great
learning
caused
the
orientals
to
compare
him
with
the
mercury
or
hermes
of
the
egyptians
and
greeks
just
as
the
northern
peoples
compared
their
wodan
or
odin
to
this
same
mercury
that
is
why
mercredi
wednesday
or
the
day
of
mercury
was
called
wodansdag
by
the
northern
peoples
but
day
of
zerdust
by
the
asiatics
since
it
is
named
zarschamba
or
dsearschambe
by
the
turks
and
the
persians
zerda
by
the
hungarians
from
the
and
sreda
by
the
slavs
from
the
heart
of
great
russia
as
far
as
the
wends
of
the
luneburg
region
the
slavs
having
learnt
the
name
also
from
the
orientals
these
observations
will
perhaps
not
be
displeasing
to
the
curious
and
i
flatter
myself
that
the
small
dialogue
ending
the
essays
written
to
oppose
bayle
will
give
some
satisfaction
to
those
who
are
well
pleased
to
see
difficult
but
important
truths
set
forth
in
an
easy
and
familiar
way
i
have
written
in
a
foreign
language
at
the
risk
of
making
many
errors
in
it
because
that
language
has
been
recently
used
by
others
in
treating
of
my
subject
and
because
it
is
more
generally
read
by
those
whom
one
would
wish
to
benefit
by
this
small
work
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
language
errors
will
be
pardoned
they
are
to
be
attributed
not
only
to
the
printer
and
the
copyist
but
also
to
the
haste
of
the
author
who
has
been
much
distracted
from
his
task
if
moreover
any
error
has
crept
into
the
ideas
expressed
the
author
will
be
the
first
to
correct
it
once
he
has
been
better
informed
he
has
given
elsewhere
such
indications
of
his
love
of
truth
that
he
hopes
this
declaration
will
not
be
regarded
as
merely
an
empty
phrase
preliminary
dissertation
on
the
conformity
of
faith
with
reason
i
begin
with
the
preliminary
question
of
the
of
faith
with
and
the
use
of
philosophy
in
theology
because
it
has
much
influence
on
the
main
subject
of
my
treatise
and
because
bayle
introduces
it
everywhere
i
assume
that
two
truths
can
not
contradict
each
other
that
the
object
of
faith
is
the
truth
god
has
revealed
in
an
extraordinary
way
and
that
reason
is
the
linking
together
of
truths
but
especially
when
it
is
compared
with
faith
of
those
whereto
the
human
mind
can
attain
naturally
without
being
aided
by
the
light
of
faith
this
definition
of
reason
that
is
to
say
of
strict
and
true
reason
has
surprised
some
persons
accustomed
to
inveigh
against
reason
taken
in
a
vague
sense
they
gave
me
the
answer
that
they
had
never
heard
of
any
such
explanation
of
it
the
truth
is
that
they
have
never
conferred
with
people
who
expressed
themselves
clearly
on
these
subjects
they
have
confessed
to
me
nevertheless
that
one
could
not
find
fault
with
reason
understood
in
the
sense
which
i
gave
to
it
it
is
in
the
same
sense
that
sometimes
reason
is
contrasted
with
experience
reason
since
it
consists
in
the
linking
together
of
truths
is
entitled
to
connect
also
those
wherewith
experience
has
furnished
it
in
order
thence
to
draw
mixed
conclusions
but
reason
pure
and
simple
as
distinct
from
experience
only
has
to
do
with
truths
independent
of
the
senses
and
one
may
compare
faith
with
experience
since
faith
in
respect
of
the
motives
that
give
it
justification
depends
upon
the
experience
of
those
who
have
seen
the
miracles
whereon
revelation
is
founded
and
upon
the
trustworthy
tradition
which
has
handed
them
down
to
us
whether
through
the
scriptures
or
by
the
account
of
those
who
have
preserved
them
it
is
rather
as
we
rely
upon
the
experience
of
those
who
have
seen
china
and
on
the
credibility
of
their
account
when
we
give
credence
to
the
wonders
that
are
told
us
of
that
distant
country
yet
i
would
also
take
into
account
the
inward
motion
of
the
holy
spirit
who
takes
possession
of
souls
and
persuades
them
and
prompts
them
to
good
that
is
to
faith
and
to
charity
without
always
having
need
of
motives
now
the
truths
of
reason
are
of
two
kinds
the
one
kind
is
of
those
called
the
verities
which
are
altogether
necessary
so
that
the
opposite
implies
contradiction
such
are
the
truths
whose
necessity
is
logical
metaphysical
or
geometrical
which
one
can
not
deny
without
being
led
into
absurdities
there
are
others
which
may
be
called
because
they
are
the
laws
which
it
has
pleased
god
to
give
to
nature
or
because
they
depend
upon
those
we
learn
them
either
by
experience
that
is
or
by
reason
and
that
is
by
considerations
of
the
fitness
of
things
which
have
caused
their
choice
this
fitness
of
things
has
also
its
rules
and
reasons
but
it
is
the
free
choice
of
god
and
not
a
geometrical
necessity
which
causes
preference
for
what
is
fitting
and
brings
it
into
existence
thus
one
may
say
that
physical
necessity
is
founded
on
moral
necessity
that
is
on
the
wise
one
choice
which
is
worthy
of
his
wisdom
and
that
both
of
these
ought
to
be
distinguished
from
geometrical
necessity
it
is
this
physical
necessity
that
makes
order
in
nature
and
lies
in
the
rules
of
motion
and
in
some
other
general
laws
which
it
pleased
god
to
lay
down
for
things
when
he
gave
them
being
it
is
therefore
true
that
god
gave
such
laws
not
without
reason
for
he
chooses
nothing
from
caprice
and
as
though
by
chance
or
in
pure
indifference
but
the
general
reasons
of
good
and
of
order
which
have
prompted
him
to
the
choice
may
be
overcome
in
some
cases
by
stronger
reasons
of
a
superior
order
thus
it
is
made
clear
that
god
can
exempt
creatures
from
the
laws
he
has
prescribed
for
them
and
produce
in
them
that
which
their
nature
does
not
bear
by
performing
a
miracle
when
they
have
risen
to
perfections
and
faculties
nobler
than
those
whereto
they
can
by
their
nature
attain
the
schoolmen
call
this
faculty
an
power
that
is
to
say
a
power
which
the
thing
acquires
by
obeying
the
command
of
him
who
can
give
that
which
the
thing
has
not
the
schoolmen
however
usually
give
instances
of
this
power
which
to
me
appear
impossible
they
maintain
for
example
that
god
can
give
the
creature
the
faculty
to
create
it
may
be
that
there
are
miracles
which
god
performs
through
the
ministry
of
angels
where
the
laws
of
nature
are
not
violated
any
more
than
when
men
assist
nature
by
art
the
skill
of
angels
differing
from
ours
only
by
degree
of
perfection
nevertheless
it
still
remains
true
that
the
laws
of
nature
are
subject
to
be
dispensed
from
by
the
whereas
the
eternal
verities
as
for
instance
those
of
geometry
admit
no
dispensation
and
faith
can
not
contradict
them
thus
it
is
that
there
can
not
be
any
invincible
objection
to
truth
for
if
it
is
a
question
of
proof
which
is
founded
upon
principles
or
incontestable
facts
and
formed
by
a
linking
together
of
eternal
verities
the
conclusion
is
certain
and
essential
and
that
which
is
contrary
to
it
must
be
false
otherwise
two
contradictories
might
be
true
at
the
same
time
if
the
objection
is
not
conclusive
it
can
only
form
a
probable
argument
which
has
no
force
against
faith
since
it
is
agreed
that
the
mysteries
of
religion
are
contrary
to
appearances
now
bayle
declares
in
his
posthumous
reply
to
le
clerc
that
he
does
not
claim
that
there
are
demonstrations
contrary
to
the
truths
of
faith
and
as
a
result
all
these
insuperable
difficulties
these
wars
between
reason
and
faith
vanish
away
motus
animorum
atque
haec
discrimina
tanta
exigui
jactu
compressa
protestant
theologians
as
well
as
those
of
the
roman
confession
admit
the
maxims
which
i
have
just
laid
down
when
they
handle
the
matter
with
attention
and
all
that
is
said
against
reason
has
no
force
save
against
a
kind
of
counterfeit
reason
corrupted
and
deluded
by
false
appearances
it
is
the
same
with
our
notions
of
the
justice
and
the
goodness
of
god
which
are
spoken
of
sometimes
as
if
we
had
neither
any
idea
nor
any
definition
of
their
nature
but
in
that
case
we
should
have
no
ground
for
ascribing
these
attributes
to
him
or
lauding
him
for
them
his
goodness
and
his
justice
as
well
as
his
wisdom
differ
from
ours
only
because
they
are
infinitely
more
perfect
thus
the
simple
notions
the
necessary
truths
and
the
conclusive
results
of
philosophy
can
not
be
contrary
to
revelation
and
when
some
philosophical
maxims
are
rejected
in
theology
the
reason
is
that
they
are
considered
to
have
only
a
physical
or
moral
necessity
which
speaks
only
of
that
which
takes
place
usually
and
is
consequently
founded
on
appearances
but
which
may
be
withheld
if
god
so
pleases
it
seems
according
to
what
i
have
just
said
that
there
is
often
some
confusion
in
the
expressions
of
those
who
set
at
variance
philosophy
and
theology
or
faith
and
reason
they
confuse
the
terms
and
i
find
that
bayle
shrewd
as
he
is
is
not
always
free
from
this
confusion
mysteries
may
be
sufficiently
to
justify
belief
in
them
but
one
can
not
them
nor
give
understanding
of
how
they
come
to
pass
thus
even
in
natural
philosophy
we
explain
up
to
a
certain
point
sundry
perceptible
qualities
but
in
an
imperfect
manner
for
we
do
not
comprehend
them
nor
is
it
possible
for
us
either
to
prove
mysteries
by
reason
for
all
that
which
can
be
proved
or
by
pure
reason
can
be
comprehended
all
that
remains
for
us
then
after
having
believed
in
the
mysteries
by
reason
of
the
proofs
of
the
truth
of
religion
which
are
called
of
credibility
is
to
be
able
to
them
against
objections
without
that
our
belief
in
them
would
have
no
firm
foundation
for
all
that
which
can
be
refuted
in
a
sound
and
conclusive
manner
can
not
but
be
false
and
such
proofs
of
the
truth
of
religion
as
can
give
only
a
would
be
balanced
and
even
outweighed
by
such
objections
as
would
give
an
provided
they
were
convincing
and
altogether
conclusive
this
little
might
suffice
me
to
remove
the
difficulties
concerning
the
use
of
reason
and
philosophy
in
relation
to
religion
if
one
had
not
to
deal
all
too
often
with
prejudiced
persons
but
as
the
subject
is
important
and
it
has
fallen
into
a
state
of
confusion
it
will
be
well
to
take
it
in
greater
detail
the
question
of
the
of
faith
with
has
always
been
a
great
problem
in
the
primitive
church
the
ablest
christian
authors
adapted
themselves
to
the
ideas
of
the
platonists
which
were
the
most
acceptable
to
them
and
were
at
that
time
most
generally
in
favour
little
by
little
aristotle
took
the
place
of
plato
when
the
taste
for
systems
began
to
prevail
and
when
theology
itself
became
more
systematic
owing
to
the
decisions
of
the
general
councils
which
provided
precise
and
positive
formularies
augustine
boethius
and
cassiodorus
in
the
west
and
john
of
damascus
in
the
east
contributed
most
towards
reducing
theology
to
scientific
form
not
to
mention
bede
alcuin
anselm
and
some
other
theologians
versed
in
philosophy
finally
came
the
schoolmen
the
leisure
of
the
cloisters
giving
full
scope
for
speculation
which
was
assisted
by
aristotle
philosophy
translated
from
the
arabic
there
was
formed
at
last
a
compound
of
theology
and
philosophy
wherein
most
of
the
questions
arose
from
the
trouble
that
was
taken
to
reconcile
faith
with
reason
but
this
had
not
met
with
the
full
success
hoped
for
because
theology
had
been
much
corrupted
by
the
unhappiness
of
the
times
by
ignorance
and
obstinacy
moreover
philosophy
in
addition
to
its
own
faults
which
were
very
great
found
itself
burdened
with
those
of
theology
which
in
its
turn
was
suffering
from
association
with
a
philosophy
that
was
very
obscure
and
very
imperfect
one
must
confess
notwithstanding
with
the
incomparable
grotius
that
there
is
sometimes
gold
hidden
under
the
rubbish
of
the
monks
barbarous
latin
i
have
therefore
wished
that
a
man
of
talent
whose
office
had
necessitated
his
learning
the
language
of
the
schoolmen
had
chosen
to
extract
thence
whatever
is
of
worth
and
that
another
petau
or
thomasius
had
done
in
respect
of
the
schoolmen
what
these
two
learned
men
have
done
in
respect
of
the
fathers
it
would
be
a
very
curious
work
and
very
important
for
ecclesiastical
history
and
it
would
continue
the
history
of
dogmas
up
to
the
time
of
the
revival
of
letters
owing
to
which
the
aspect
of
things
has
changed
and
even
beyond
that
point
for
sundry
dogmas
such
as
those
of
physical
predetermination
of
mediate
knowledge
philosophical
sin
objective
precisions
and
many
other
dogmas
in
speculative
theology
and
even
in
the
practical
theology
of
cases
of
conscience
came
into
currency
even
after
the
council
of
trent
a
little
before
these
changes
and
before
the
great
schism
in
the
west
that
still
endures
there
was
in
italy
a
sect
of
philosophers
which
disputed
this
conformity
of
faith
with
reason
which
i
maintain
they
were
dubbed
because
they
were
adherents
of
a
famous
arab
author
who
was
called
the
commentator
by
and
who
appeared
to
be
the
one
of
all
his
race
that
penetrated
furthest
into
aristotle
meaning
this
commentator
extending
what
greek
expositors
had
already
taught
maintained
that
according
to
aristotle
and
even
according
to
reason
and
at
that
time
the
two
were
considered
almost
identical
there
was
no
case
for
the
immortality
of
the
soul
here
is
his
reasoning
the
human
kind
is
eternal
according
to
aristotle
therefore
if
individual
souls
die
not
one
must
resort
to
the
metempsychosis
rejected
by
that
philosopher
or
if
there
are
always
new
souls
one
must
admit
the
infinity
of
these
souls
existing
from
all
eternity
but
actual
infinity
is
impossible
according
to
the
doctrine
of
the
same
aristotle
therefore
it
is
a
necessary
conclusion
that
the
souls
that
is
the
forms
of
organic
bodies
must
perish
with
the
bodies
or
at
least
this
must
happen
to
the
passive
understanding
that
belongs
to
each
one
individually
thus
there
will
only
remain
the
active
understanding
common
to
all
men
which
according
to
aristotle
comes
from
outside
and
which
must
work
wheresoever
the
organs
are
suitably
disposed
even
as
the
wind
produces
a
kind
of
music
when
it
is
blown
into
properly
adjusted
organ
pipes
nothing
could
have
been
weaker
than
this
proof
it
is
not
true
that
aristotle
refuted
metempsychosis
or
that
he
proved
the
eternity
of
the
human
kind
and
after
all
it
is
quite
untrue
that
an
actual
infinity
is
impossible
yet
this
proof
passed
as
irresistible
amongst
aristotelians
and
induced
in
them
the
belief
that
there
was
a
certain
sublunary
intelligence
and
that
our
active
intellect
was
produced
by
participation
in
it
but
others
who
adhered
less
to
aristotle
went
so
far
as
to
advocate
a
universal
soul
forming
the
ocean
of
all
individual
souls
and
believed
this
universal
soul
alone
capable
of
subsisting
whilst
individual
souls
are
born
and
die
according
to
this
opinion
the
souls
of
animals
are
born
by
being
separated
like
drops
from
their
ocean
when
they
find
a
body
which
they
can
animate
and
they
die
by
being
reunited
to
the
ocean
of
souls
when
the
body
is
destroyed
as
streams
are
lost
in
the
sea
many
even
went
so
far
as
to
believe
that
god
is
that
universal
soul
although
others
thought
that
this
soul
was
subordinate
and
created
this
bad
doctrine
is
very
ancient
and
apt
to
dazzle
the
common
herd
it
is
expressed
in
these
beautiful
lines

been

in
this
sense
by
some
but
there
is
more
indication
that
the
stoics
succumbed
to
that
universal
soul
which
swallows
all
the
rest
those
who
are
of
this
opinion
might
be
called
since
according
to
them
there
is
in
reality
only
one

observes
that
this
is
an
opinion
almost
universally
accepted
amongst
scholars
in
persia

in
the
states

it
appears
even
that
it
has
gained
a
footing
with

with
the

years

adopted
the

that

revived

ancient
cabala
of

confuted

to
be

are
but
transient

evidently
good

whose
expressions
are
excusable

it
would
be
better
to
write
in
a
manner
that
has
no
need
of
excuses
although
i
confess
that
expressions
which
are
extravagant
and
as
it
were
poetical
have
greater
force
to
move
and
to
persuade
than
correct
forms
of
statement
the
annihilation
of
all
that
belongs
to
us
in

own
right

to
great
lengths
by

might
equally

minds

is

example
concerning

originator
of
a
great
chinese
sect
after
having
preached
his
religion
for
forty
years
when
he
felt
death
was
approaching
he
declared
to
his
disciples
that
he
had
hidden
the
truth
from
them
under
the
veil
of
metaphors
and
that
all
reduced
itself
to
nothingness
which
he
said
was
the
first
source
of
all
things
that
was
still
worse
so
it
would
seem
than
the
opinion
of
the
averroists
both
of
these
doctrines
are
indefensible
and
even
extravagant
nevertheless
some
moderns
have
made
no
difficulty
about
adopting
this
one
and
universal
soul
that
engulfs
the
rest
it
has
met
with
only
too
much
applause

soldier
and

of

one
time

publicly
in
his
discourses
the
system
of
harmony
is
the
one
best
qualified
to
cure
this
evil
for
it
shows
that
there
are
of
necessity
substances
which
are
simple
and
without
extension
scattered
throughout
all
nature
that
these
substances
must
subsist
independently
of
every
other
except
god
and
that
they
are
never
wholly
separated
from
organic
body
those
who
believe
that
souls
capable
of
feeling
but
incapable
of
reason
are
mortal
or
who
maintain
that
none
but
reasoning
souls
can
have
feeling
offer
a
handle
to
the
monopsychites
for
it
will
ever
be
difficult
to
persuade
men
that
beasts
feel
nothing
and
once
the
admission
has
been
made
that
that
which
is
capable
of
feeling
can
die
it
is
difficult
to
found
upon
reason
a
proof
of
the
immortality
of
our
souls
i
have
made
this
short
digression
because
it
appeared
to
me
seasonable
at
a
time
when
there
is
only
too
much
tendency
to
overthrow
natural
religion
to
its
very
foundations
i
return
then
to
the
averroists
who
were
persuaded
that
their
dogma
was
proved
conclusively
in
accordance
with
reason
as
a
result
they
declared
that
man
soul
is
according
to
philosophy
mortal
while
they
protested
their
acquiescence
in
christian
theology
which
declares
the
soul
immortality
but
this
distinction
was
held
suspect
and
this
divorce
between
faith
and
reason
was
vehemently
rejected
by
the
prelates
and
the
doctors
of
that
time
and
condemned
in
the
last
lateran
council
under
leo
x
on
that
occasion
also
scholars
were
urged
to
work
for
the
removal
of
the
difficulties
that
appeared
to
set
theology
and
philosophy
at
variance
the
doctrine
of
their
incompatibility
continued
to
hold
its
ground
pomponazzi
was
suspected
of
it
although
he
declared
himself
otherwise
and
that
very
sect
of
the
averroists
survived
as
a
school
it
is
thought
that
caesar
cremoninus
a
philosopher
famous
in
his
time
was
one
of
its
mainstays
andreas
cisalpinus
a
physician
and
an
author
of
merit
who
came
nearest
after
michael
servetus
to
the
discovery
of
the
circulation
of
the
blood
was
accused
by
nicolas
taurel
in
a
book
entitled
of
belonging
to
these
peripatetics
traces
of
this
doctrine
are
found
also
in
the
pisanus
claudii
an
author
of
french
nationality
who
migrated
to
italy
and
taught
philosophy
at
pisa
but
especially
the
writings
and
the
letters
of
gabriel
naudé
as
well
as
the
show
that
averroism
still
lived
on
when
this
learned
physician
was
in
italy
corpuscular
philosophy
introduced
shortly
after
appears
to
have
extinguished
this
excessively
peripatetic
sect
or
perhaps
to
have
been
intermixed
with
its
teaching
it
may
be
indeed
that
there
have
been
atomists
who
would
be
inclined
to
teach
dogmas
like
those
of
the
averroists
if
circumstances
so
permitted
but
this
abuse
can
not
harm
such
good
as
there
is
in
corpuscular
philosophy
which
can
very
well
be
combined
with
all
that
is
sound
in
plato
and
in
aristotle
and
bring
them
both
into
harmony
with
true
theology
the
reformers
and
especially
luther
as
i
have
already
observed
spoke
sometimes
as
if
they
rejected
philosophy
and
deemed
it
inimical
to
faith
but
properly
speaking
luther
understood
by
philosophy
only
that
which
is
in
conformity
with
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
or
perhaps
even
philosophy
as
it
was
taught
in
the
schools
thus
for
example
he
says
that
it
is
impossible
in
philosophy
that
is
in
the
order
of
nature
that
the
word
be
made
flesh
and
he
goes
so
far
as
to
maintain
that
what
is
true
in
natural
philosophy
might
be
false
in
ethics
aristotle
was
the
object
of
his
anger
and
so
far
back
as
the
year
he
contemplated
the
purging
of
philosophy
when
he
perhaps
had
as
yet
no
thoughts
of
reforming
the
church
but
at
last
he
curbed
his
vehemence
and
in
the
for
the
augsburg
allowed
a
favourable
mention
of
aristotle
and
his
melanchthon
a
man
of
sound
and
moderate
ideas
made
little
systems
from
the
several
parts
of
philosophy
adapted
to
the
truths
of
revelation
and
useful
in
civic
life
which
deserve
to
be
read
even
now
after
him
pierre
de
la
ramée
entered
the
lists
his
philosophy
was
much
in
favour
the
sect
of
the
ramists
was
powerful
in
germany
gaining
many
adherents
among
the
protestants
and
even
concerning
itself
with
theology
until
the
revival
of
corpuscular
philosophy
which
caused
that
of
ramée
to
fall
into
oblivion
and
weakened
the
authority
of
the
peripatetics
meanwhile
sundry
protestant
theologians
deviating
as
far
as
they
could
from
scholastic
philosophy
which
prevailed
in
the
opposite
party
went
so
far
as
to
despise
philosophy
itself
which
to
them
was
suspect
the
controversy
blazed
up
finally
owing
to
the
rancour
of
daniel
hoffmann
he
was
an
able
theologian
who
had
previously
gained
a
reputation
at
the
conference
of
quedlinburg
when
tilemann
heshusius
and
he
had
supported
duke
julius
of
brunswick
in
his
refusal
to
accept
the
formula
of
concord
for
some
reason
or
other
hoffmann
flew
into
a
passion
with
philosophy
instead
of
being
content
to
find
fault
with
the
wrong
uses
made
thereof
by
philosophers
he
was
however
aiming
at
the
famous
caselius
a
man
esteemed
by
the
princes
and
scholars
of
his
time
and
henry
julius
duke
of
brunswick
son
of
julius
founder
of
the
university
having
taken
the
trouble
himself
to
investigate
the
matter
condemned
the
theologian
there
have
been
some
small
disputes
of
the
kind
since
but
it
has
always
been
found
that
they
were
misunderstandings
paul
slevogt
a
famous
professor
at
jena
in
thuringia
whose
still
extant
treatises
prove
how
well
versed
he
was
in
scholastic
philosophy
as
also
in
hebrew
literature
had
published
in
his
youth
under
the
title
of
a
little
book
dissidio
theologi
et
philosophi
in
utriusque
principiis
fundato
bearing
on
the
question
whether
god
is
accidentally
the
cause
of
sin
but
it
was
easy
to
see
that
his
aim
was
to
demonstrate
that
theologians
sometimes
misuse
philosophical
terms
to
come
now
to
the
events
of
my
own
time
i
remember
that
when
in
louis
meyer
a
physician
of
amsterdam
published
anonymously
the
book
entitled
scripturae
by
many
persons
wrongly
attributed
to
spinoza
his
friend
the
theologians
of
holland
bestirred
themselves
and
their
written
attacks
upon
this
book
gave
rise
to
great
disputes
among
them
divers
of
them
held
the
opinion
that
the
cartesians
in
confuting
the
anonymous
philosopher
had
conceded
too
much
to
philosophy
jean
de
labadie
before
he
had
seceded
from
the
reformed
church
his
pretext
being
some
abuses
which
he
said
had
crept
into
public
observance
and
which
he
considered
intolerable
attacked
the
book
by
herr
von
wollzogen
and
called
it
pernicious
on
the
other
hand
herr
vogelsang
herr
van
der
weye
and
some
other
also
assailed
the
same
book
with
much
acrimony
but
the
accused
won
his
case
in
a
synod
afterwards
in
holland
people
spoke
of
and
theologians
a
party
distinction
often
mentioned
by
bayle
who
finally
declared
himself
against
the
former
but
there
is
no
indication
that
any
precise
rules
have
yet
been
defined
which
the
rival
parties
accept
or
reject
with
regard
to
the
use
of
reason
in
the
interpretation
of
holy
scripture
a
like
dispute
has
threatened
of
late
to
disturb
the
peace
in
the
churches
of
the
augsburg
confession
some
masters
of
arts
in
the
university
of
leipzig
gave
private
lessons
at
their
homes
to
students
who
sought
them
out
in
order
to
learn
what
is
called
philologia
according
to
the
practice
of
this
university
and
of
some
others
where
this
kind
of
study
is
not
restricted
to
the
faculty
of
theology
these
masters
pressed
the
study
of
the
holy
scriptures
and
the
practice
of
piety
further
than
their
fellows
had
been
wont
to
do
it
is
alleged
that
they
had
carried
certain
things
to
excess
and
aroused
suspicions
of
certain
doctrinal
innovations
this
caused
them
to
be
dubbed
as
though
they
were
a
new
sect
and
this
name
is
one
which
has
since
caused
a
great
stir
in
germany
it
has
been
applied
somehow
or
other
to
those
whom
one
suspected
or
pretended
to
suspect
of
fanaticism
or
even
of
hypocrisy
concealed
under
some
semblance
of
reform
now
some
of
the
students
attending
these
masters
had
become
conspicuous
for
behaviour
which
gave
general
offence
and
amongst
other
things
for
their
scorn
of
philosophy
even
so
it
was
said
burning
their
notebooks
in
consequence
the
belief
arose
that
their
masters
rejected
philosophy
but
they
justified
themselves
very
well
nor
could
they
be
convicted
either
of
this
error
or
of
the
heresies
that
were
being
imputed
to
them
the
question
of
the
use
of
philosophy
in
theology
was
debated
much
amongst
christians
and
difficulty
was
experienced
over
settling
the
limits
of
its
use
when
it
came
to
detailed
consideration
the
mysteries
of
the
trinity
of
the
incarnation
and
of
the
holy
communion
gave
most
occasion
for
dispute
the
new
photinians
disputing
the
first
two
mysteries
made
use
of
certain
philosophic
maxims
which
andreas
kessler
a
theologian
of
the
augsburg
confession
summarized
in
the
various
treatises
that
he
published
on
the
parts
of
the
socinian
philosophy
but
as
to
their
metaphysics
one
might
instruct
oneself
better
therein
by
reading
the
work
of
christopher
stegmann
the
socinian
it
is
not
yet
in
print
but
i
saw
it
in
my
youth
and
it
has
been
recently
again
in
my
hands
calovius
and
scherzer
authors
well
versed
in
scholastic
philosophy
and
sundry
other
able
theologians
answered
the
socinians
at
great
length
and
often
with
success
for
they
would
not
content
themselves
with
the
general
and
somewhat
cavalier
answers
that
were
commonly
used
against
that
sect
the
drift
of
such
answers
was
that
their
maxims
were
good
in
philosophy
and
not
in
theology
that
it
was
the
fault
of
heterogeneousness
called
greek
metábasis
eis
állo
génos
to
apply
those
maxims
to
a
matter
transcending
reason
and
that
philosophy
should
be
treated
as
a
servant
and
not
a
mistress
in
relation
to
theology
according
to
the
title
of
the
book
by
a
scot
named
robert
baronius
theologiae
in
fine
philosophy
was
a
hagar
beside
sara
and
must
be
driven
from
the
house
with
her
ishmael
when
she
was
refractory
there
is
something
good
in
these
answers
but
one
might
abuse
them
and
set
natural
truths
and
truths
of
revelation
at
variance
scholars
therefore
applied
themselves
to
distinguishing
between
what
is
necessary
and
indispensable
in
natural
or
philosophic
truths
and
that
which
is
not
so
the
two
protestant
parties
are
tolerably
in
agreement
when
it
is
a
question
of
making
war
on
the
socinians
and
as
the
philosophy
of
these
sectaries
is
not
of
the
most
exact
in
most
cases
the
attack
succeeded
in
reducing
it
but
the
protestants
themselves
had
dissensions
on
the
matter
of
the
eucharistic
sacrament
a
section
of
those
who
are
called
reformed
namely
those
who
on
that
point
follow
rather
zwingli
than
calvin
seemed
to
reduce
the
participation
in
the
body
of
jesus
christ
in
the
holy
communion
to
a
mere
figurative
representation
employing
the
maxim
of
the
philosophers
which
states
that
a
body
can
only
be
in
one
place
at
a
time
contrariwise
the
evangelicals
who
name
themselves
thus
in
a
particular
sense
to
distinguish
themselves
from
the
reformed
being
more
attached
to
the
literal
sense
of
scripture
opined
with
luther
that
this
participation
was
real
and
that
here
there
lay
a
supernatural
mystery
they
reject
in
truth
the
dogma
of
transubstantiation
which
they
believe
to
be
without
foundation
in
the
text
neither
do
they
approve
that
of
consubstantiation
or
of
impanation
which
one
could
only
impute
to
them
if
one
were
on
their
opinion
for
they
admit
no
inclusion
of
the
body
of
jesus
christ
in
the
bread
nor
do
they
even
require
any
union
of
the
one
with
the
other
but
they
demand
at
least
a
concomitance
so
that
these
two
substances
be
received
both
at
the
same
time
they
believe
that
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
words
of
jesus
christ
on
an
occasion
so
important
as
that
which
concerned
the
expression
of
his
last
wishes
ought
to
be
preserved
thus
in
order
to
show
that
this
sense
is
free
from
all
absurdity
which
could
make
it
repugnant
to
us
they
maintain
that
the
philosophic
maxim
restricting
the
existence
of
and
partaking
in
bodies
to
one
place
alone
is
simply
a
consequence
of
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
they
make
that
no
obstacle
to
the
presence
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
of
the
body
of
our
saviour
in
such
form
as
may
be
in
keeping
with
the
most
glorified
body
they
do
not
resort
to
a
vague
diffusion
of
ubiquity
which
would
disperse
the
body
and
leave
it
nowhere
in
particular
nor
do
they
admit
the
theory
of
some
schoolmen
as
if
to
say
one
and
the
same
body
could
be
at
the
same
time
seated
here
and
standing
elsewhere
in
fine
they
so
express
themselves
that
many
consider
the
opinion
of
calvin
authorized
by
sundry
confessions
of
faith
from
the
churches
that
have
accepted
his
teaching
to
be
not
so
far
removed
from
the
augsburg
confession
as
one
might
think
for
he
affirmed
a
partaking
in
the
substance
the
divergence
rests
perhaps
only
upon
the
fact
that
calvin
demands
true
faith
in
addition
to
the
oral
reception
of
the
symbols
and
consequently
excludes
the
unworthy
thence
we
see
that
the
dogma
of
real
and
substantial
participation
can
be
supported
without
resorting
to
the
strange
opinions
of
some
schoolmen
by
a
properly
understood
analogy
between
and
many
philosophers
have
deemed
that
even
in
the
order
of
nature
a
body
may
operate
from
a
distance
immediately
on
many
remote
bodies
at
the
same
time
so
do
they
believe
all
the
more
that
nothing
can
prevent
divine
omnipotence
from
causing
one
body
to
be
present
in
many
bodies
together
since
the
transition
from
immediate
operation
to
presence
is
but
slight
the
one
perhaps
depending
upon
the
other
it
is
true
that
modern
philosophers
for
some
time
now
have
denied
the
immediate
natural
operation
of
one
body
upon
another
remote
from
it
and
i
confess
that
i
am
of
their
opinion
meanwhile
remote
operation
has
just
been
revived
in
england
by
the
admirable
newton
who
maintains
that
it
is
the
nature
of
bodies
to
be
attracted
and
gravitate
one
towards
another
in
proportion
to
the
mass
of
each
one
and
the
rays
of
attraction
it
receives
accordingly
the
famous
locke
in
his
answer
to
bishop
stillingfleet
declares
that
having
seen
newton
book
he
retracts
what
he
himself
said
following
the
opinion
of
the
moderns
in
his
concerning
human
to
wit
that
a
body
can
not
operate
immediately
upon
another
except
by
touching
it
upon
its
surface
and
driving
it
by
its
motion
he
acknowledges
that
god
can
put
properties
into
matter
which
cause
it
to
operate
from
a
distance
thus
the
theologians
of
the
augsburg
confession
claim
that
god
may
ordain
not
only
that
a
body
operate
immediately
on
divers
bodies
remote
from
one
another
but
that
it
even
exist
in
their
neighbourhood
and
be
received
by
them
in
a
way
with
which
distances
of
place
and
dimensions
of
space
have
nothing
to
do
although
this
effect
transcends
the
forces
of
nature
they
do
not
think
it
possible
to
show
that
it
surpasses
the
power
of
the
author
of
nature
for
him
it
is
easy
to
annul
the
laws
that
he
has
given
or
to
dispense
with
them
as
seems
good
to
him
in
the
same
way
as
he
was
able
to
make
iron
float
upon
water
and
to
stay
the
operation
of
fire
upon
the
human
body
i
found
in
comparing
the
of
nicolaus
vedelius
with
the
refutation
by
johann
musaeus
that
these
two
authors
of
whom
one
died
while
a
professor
at
franecker
after
having
taught
at
geneva
and
the
other
finally
became
the
foremost
theologian
at
jena
are
more
or
less
in
agreement
on
the
principal
rules
for
the
use
of
reason
but
that
it
is
in
the
application
of
these
rules
they
disagree
for
they
both
agree
that
revelation
can
not
be
contrary
to
the
truths
whose
necessity
is
called
by
philosophers
or
that
is
to
say
whose
opposite
implies
contradiction
they
both
admit
also
that
revelation
will
be
able
to
combat
maxims
whose
necessity
is
called
and
is
founded
only
upon
the
laws
that
the
will
of
god
has
prescribed
for
nature
thus
the
question
whether
the
presence
of
one
and
the
same
body
in
divers
places
is
possible
in
the
supernatural
order
only
touches
the
application
of
the
rule
and
in
order
to
decide
this
question
conclusively
by
reason
one
must
needs
explain
exactly
wherein
the
essence
of
body
consists
even
the
reformed
disagree
thereon
amongst
themselves
the
cartesians
confine
it
to
extension
but
their
adversaries
oppose
that
and
i
think
i
have
even
observed
that
gisbertus
voëtius
a
famous
theologian
of
utrecht
doubted
the
alleged
impossibility
of
plurality
of
locations
furthermore
although
the
two
protestant
parties
agree
that
one
must
distinguish
these
two
necessities
which
i
have
just
indicated
namely
metaphysical
necessity
and
physical
necessity
and
that
the
first
excludes
exceptions
even
in
the
case
of
mysteries
they
are
not
yet
sufficiently
agreed
upon
the
rules
of
interpretation
which
serve
to
determine
in
what
cases
it
is
permitted
to
desert
the
letter
of
scripture
when
one
is
not
certain
that
it
is
contrary
to
strictly
universal
truths
it
is
agreed
that
there
are
cases
where
one
must
reject
a
literal
interpretation
that
is
not
absolutely
impossible
when
it
is
otherwise
unsuitable
for
instance
all
commentators
agree
that
when
our
lord
said
that
herod
was
a
fox
he
meant
it
metaphorically
and
one
must
accept
that
unless
one
imagine
with
some
fanatics
that
for
the
time
the
words
of
our
lord
lasted
herod
was
actually
changed
into
a
fox
but
it
is
not
the
same
with
the
texts
on
which
mysteries
are
founded
where
the
theologians
of
the
augsburg
confession
deem
that
one
must
keep
to
the
literal
sense
since
moreover
this
discussion
belongs
to
the
art
of
interpretation
and
not
to
that
which
is
the
proper
sphere
of
logic
we
will
not
here
enter
thereon
especially
as
it
has
nothing
in
common
with
the
disputes
that
have
arisen
recently
upon
the
conformity
of
faith
with
reason
theologians
of
all
parties
i
believe
fanatics
alone
excepted
agree
at
least
that
no
article
of
faith
must
imply
contradiction
or
contravene
proofs
as
exact
as
those
of
mathematics
where
the
opposite
of
the
conclusion
can
be
reduced
that
is
to
contradiction
athanasius
with
good
reason
made
sport
of
the
preposterous
ideas
of
some
writers
of
his
time
who
maintained
that
god
had
suffered
without
any
suffering
est
impassibiliter
o
ludicram
doctrinam
aedificantem
simul
et
demolientem
it
follows
thence
that
certain
writers
have
been
too
ready
to
grant
that
the
holy
trinity
is
contrary
to
that
great
principle
which
states
that
two
things
which
are
the
same
as
a
third
are
also
the
same
as
each
other
that
is
to
say
if
a
is
the
same
as
b
and
if
c
is
the
same
as
b
then
a
and
c
must
also
be
the
same
as
each
other
for
this
principle
is
a
direct
consequence
of
that
of
contradiction
and
forms
the
basis
of
all
logic
and
if
it
ceases
we
can
no
longer
reason
with
certainty
thus
when
one
says
that
the
father
is
god
that
the
son
is
god
and
that
the
holy
spirit
is
god
and
that
nevertheless
there
is
only
one
god
although
these
three
persons
differ
from
one
another
one
must
consider
that
this
word
has
not
the
same
sense
at
the
beginning
as
at
the
end
of
this
statement
indeed
it
signifies
now
the
divine
substance
and
now
a
person
of
the
godhead
in
general
one
must
take
care
never
to
abandon
the
necessary
and
eternal
truths
for
the
sake
of
upholding
mysteries
lest
the
enemies
of
religion
seize
upon
such
an
occasion
for
decrying
both
religion
and
mysteries
the
distinction
which
is
generally
drawn
between
that
which
is
reason
and
that
which
is
reason
is
tolerably
in
accord
with
the
distinction
which
has
just
been
made
between
the
two
kinds
of
necessity
for
what
is
contrary
to
reason
is
contrary
to
the
absolutely
certain
and
inevitable
truths
and
what
is
above
reason
is
in
opposition
only
to
what
one
is
wont
to
experience
or
to
understand
that
is
why
i
am
surprised
that
there
are
people
of
intelligence
who
dispute
this
distinction
and
that
bayle
should
be
of
this
number
the
distinction
is
assuredly
very
well
founded
a
truth
is
above
reason
when
our
mind
or
even
every
created
mind
can
not
comprehend
it
such
is
as
it
seems
to
me
the
holy
trinity
such
are
the
miracles
reserved
for
god
alone
as
for
instance
creation
such
is
the
choice
of
the
order
of
the
universe
which
depends
upon
universal
harmony
and
upon
the
clear
knowledge
of
an
infinity
of
things
at
once
but
a
truth
can
never
be
contrary
to
reason
and
once
a
dogma
has
been
disputed
and
refuted
by
reason
instead
of
its
being
incomprehensible
one
may
say
that
nothing
is
easier
to
understand
nor
more
obvious
than
its
absurdity
for
i
observed
at
the
beginning
that
by
reason
here
i
do
not
mean
the
opinions
and
discourses
of
men
nor
even
the
habit
they
have
formed
of
judging
things
according
to
the
usual
course
of
nature
but
rather
the
inviolable
linking
together
of
truths
i
must
come
now
to
the
great
question
which
bayle
brought
up
recently
to
wit
whether
a
truth
and
especially
a
truth
of
faith
can
prove
to
be
subject
to
irrefutable
objections
this
excellent
author
appears
to
answer
with
a
bold
affirmative
he
quotes
theologians
of
repute
in
his
party
and
even
in
the
church
of
rome
who
appear
to
say
the
same
as
he
affirms
and
he
cites
philosophers
who
have
believed
that
there
are
even
philosophical
truths
whose
champions
can
not
answer
the
objections
that
are
brought
up
against
them
he
believes
that
the
theological
doctrine
of
predestination
is
of
this
nature
and
in
philosophy
that
of
the
composition
of
the
these
are
indeed
the
two
labyrinths
which
have
ever
exercised
theologians
and
philosophers
libertus
fromondus
a
theologian
of
louvain
a
great
friend
of
jansenius
whose
posthumous
book
entitled
he
in
fact
published
who
also
wrote
a
book
entitled
explicitly
de
compositione
experienced
in
full
measure
the
difficulties
inherent
in
both
doctrines
and
the
renowned
ochino
admirably
presented
what
he
calls
labyrinths
of
predestination
but
these
writers
have
not
denied
the
possibility
of
finding
thread
in
the
labyrinth
they
have
recognized
the
difficulty
but
they
have
surely
not
turned
difficulty
into
sheer
impossibility
as
for
me
i
confess
that
i
can
not
agree
with
those
who
maintain
that
a
truth
can
admit
of
irrefutable
objections
for
is
an
anything
but
an
argument
whose
conclusion
contradicts
our
thesis
and
is
not
an
irrefutable
argument
a
and
how
can
one
know
the
certainty
of
demonstrations
except
by
examining
the
argument
in
detail
the
form
and
the
matter
in
order
to
see
if
the
form
is
good
and
then
if
each
premiss
is
either
admitted
or
proved
by
another
argument
of
like
force
until
one
is
able
to
make
do
with
admitted
premisses
alone
now
if
there
is
such
an
objection
against
our
thesis
we
must
say
that
the
falsity
of
this
thesis
is
demonstrated
and
that
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
have
reasons
sufficient
to
prove
it
otherwise
two
contradictories
would
be
true
at
once
one
must
always
yield
to
proofs
whether
they
be
proposed
in
positive
form
or
advanced
in
the
shape
of
objections
and
it
is
wrong
and
fruitless
to
try
to
weaken
opponents
proofs
under
the
pretext
that
they
are
only
objections
since
the
opponent
can
play
the
same
game
and
can
reverse
the
denominations
exalting
his
arguments
by
naming
them
and
sinking
ours
under
the
blighting
title
of
it
is
another
question
whether
we
are
always
obliged
to
examine
the
objections
we
may
have
to
face
and
to
retain
some
doubt
in
respect
of
our
own
opinion
or
what
is
called
until
this
examination
has
been
made
i
would
venture
to
say
no
for
otherwise
one
would
never
attain
to
certainty
and
our
conclusion
would
be
always
provisional
i
believe
that
able
geometricians
will
scarce
be
troubled
by
the
objections
of
joseph
scaliger
against
archimedes
or
by
those
of
hobbes
against
euclid
but
that
is
because
they
have
fully
understood
and
are
sure
of
the
proofs
nevertheless
it
is
sometimes
well
to
show
oneself
ready
to
examine
certain
objections
on
the
one
hand
it
may
serve
to
rescue
people
from
their
error
while
on
the
other
we
ourselves
may
profit
by
it
for
specious
fallacies
often
contain
some
useful
solution
and
bring
about
the
removal
of
considerable
difficulties
that
is
why
i
have
always
liked
ingenious
objections
made
against
my
own
opinions
and
i
have
never
examined
them
without
profit
witness
those
which
bayle
formerly
made
against
my
system
of
harmony
not
to
mention
those
which
arnauld
foucher
and
father
lami
made
to
me
on
the
same
subject
but
to
return
to
the
principal
question
i
conclude
from
reasons
i
have
just
set
forth
that
when
an
objection
is
put
forward
against
some
truth
it
is
always
possible
to
answer
it
satisfactorily
it
may
be
also
that
bayle
does
not
mean
objections
in
the
sense
that
i
have
just
explained
i
observe
that
he
varies
at
least
in
his
expressions
for
in
his
posthumous
reply
to
le
clerc
he
does
not
admit
that
one
can
bring
demonstrations
against
the
truths
of
faith
it
appears
therefore
that
he
takes
the
objections
to
be
insoluble
only
in
respect
of
our
present
degree
of
enlightenment
and
in
this
reply
he
even
does
not
despair
of
the
possibility
that
one
day
a
solution
hitherto
unknown
may
be
found
by
someone
concerning
that
more
will
be
said
later
i
hold
an
opinion
however
that
will
perchance
cause
surprise
namely
that
this
solution
has
been
discovered
entire
and
is
not
even
particularly
difficult
indeed
a
mediocre
intelligence
capable
of
sufficient
care
and
using
correctly
the
rules
of
common
logic
is
in
a
position
to
answer
the
most
embarrassing
objection
made
against
truth
when
the
objection
is
only
taken
from
reason
and
when
it
is
claimed
to
be
a
whatever
scorn
the
generality
of
moderns
have
for
the
logic
of
aristotle
one
must
acknowledge
that
it
teaches
infallible
ways
of
resisting
error
in
these
conjunctures
for
one
has
only
to
examine
the
argument
according
to
the
rules
and
it
will
always
be
possible
to
see
whether
it
is
lacking
in
form
or
whether
there
are
premisses
such
as
are
not
yet
proved
by
a
good
argument
it
is
quite
another
matter
when
there
is
only
a
question
of
for
the
art
of
judging
from
probable
reasons
is
not
yet
well
established
so
that
our
logic
in
this
connexion
is
still
very
imperfect
and
to
this
very
day
we
have
little
beyond
the
art
of
judging
from
demonstrations
but
this
art
is
sufficient
here
for
when
it
is
a
question
of
opposing
reason
to
an
article
of
our
faith
one
is
not
disturbed
by
objections
that
only
attain
probability
everyone
agrees
that
appearances
are
against
mysteries
and
that
they
are
by
no
means
probable
when
regarded
only
from
the
standpoint
of
reason
but
it
suffices
that
they
have
in
them
nothing
of
absurdity
thus
demonstrations
are
required
if
they
are
to
be
refuted
and
doubtless
we
are
so
to
understand
it
when
holy
scripture
warns
us
that
the
wisdom
of
god
is
foolishness
before
men
and
when
paul
observed
that
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
is
foolishness
unto
the
greeks
as
well
as
unto
the
jews
a
for
after
all
one
truth
can
not
contradict
another
and
the
light
of
reason
is
no
less
a
gift
of
god
than
that
of
revelation
also
it
is
a
matter
of
no
difficulty
among
theologians
who
are
expert
in
their
profession
that
the
motives
of
credibility
justify
once
for
all
the
authority
of
holy
scripture
before
the
tribunal
of
reason
so
that
reason
in
consequence
gives
way
before
it
as
before
a
new
light
and
sacrifices
thereto
all
its
probabilities
it
is
more
or
less
as
if
a
new
president
sent
by
the
prince
must
show
his
letters
patent
in
the
assembly
where
he
is
afterwards
to
preside
that
is
the
tendency
of
sundry
good
books
that
we
have
on
the
truth
of
religion
such
as
those
of
augustinus
steuchus
of
du
or
of
grotius
for
the
true
religion
must
needs
have
marks
that
the
false
religions
have
not
else
would
zoroaster
brahma
somonacodom
and
mahomet
be
as
worthy
of
belief
as
moses
and
jesus
christ
nevertheless
divine
faith
itself
when
it
is
kindled
in
the
soul
is
something
more
than
an
opinion
and
depends
not
upon
the
occasions
or
the
motives
that
have
given
it
birth
it
advances
beyond
the
intellect
and
takes
possession
of
the
will
and
of
the
heart
to
make
us
act
with
zeal
and
joyfully
as
the
law
of
god
commands
then
we
have
no
further
need
to
think
of
reasons
or
to
pause
over
the
difficulties
of
argument
which
the
mind
may
anticipate
thus
what
we
have
just
said
of
human
reason
which
is
extolled
and
decried
by
turns
and
often
without
rule
or
measure
may
show
our
lack
of
exactitude
and
how
much
we
are
accessary
to
our
own
errors
nothing
would
be
so
easy
to
terminate
as
these
disputes
on
the
rights
of
faith
and
of
reason
if
men
would
make
use
of
the
commonest
rules
of
logic
and
reason
with
even
a
modicum
of
attention
instead
of
that
they
become
involved
in
oblique
and
ambiguous
phrases
which
give
them
a
fine
field
for
declamation
to
make
the
most
of
their
wit
and
their
learning
it
would
seem
indeed
that
they
have
no
wish
to
see
the
naked
truth
peradventure
because
they
fear
that
it
may
be
more
disagreeable
than
error
for
they
know
not
the
beauty
of
the
author
of
all
things
who
is
the
source
of
truth
this
negligence
is
a
general
defect
of
humanity
and
one
not
to
be
laid
to
the
charge
of
any
particular
person
dulcibus
as
quintilian
said
of
the
style
of
seneca
and
we
take
pleasure
in
going
astray
exactitude
incommodes
us
and
rules
we
regard
as
puerilities
thus
it
is
that
common
logic
although
it
is
more
or
less
sufficient
for
the
examination
of
arguments
that
tend
towards
certainty
is
relegated
to
schoolboys
and
there
is
not
even
a
thought
for
a
kind
of
logic
which
should
determine
the
balance
between
probabilities
and
would
be
so
necessary
in
deliberations
of
importance
so
true
is
it
that
our
mistakes
for
the
most
part
come
from
scorn
or
lack
of
the
art
of
thinking
for
nothing
is
more
imperfect
than
our
logic
when
we
pass
beyond
necessary
arguments
the
most
excellent
philosophers
of
our
time
such
as
the
authors
of
art
of
of
search
for
and
of
the
concerning
human
have
been
very
far
from
indicating
to
us
the
true
means
fitted
to
assist
the
faculty
whose
business
it
is
to
make
us
weigh
the
probabilities
of
the
true
and
the
false
not
to
mention
the
art
of
discovery
in
which
success
is
still
more
difficult
of
attainment
and
whereof
we
have
nothing
beyond
very
imperfect
samples
in
mathematics
one
thing
which
might
have
contributed
most
towards
bayle
belief
that
the
difficulties
of
reason
in
opposition
to
faith
can
not
be
obviated
is
that
he
seems
to
demand
that
god
be
justified
in
some
such
manner
as
that
commonly
used
for
pleading
the
cause
of
a
man
accused
before
his
judge
but
he
has
not
remembered
that
in
the
tribunals
of
men
which
can
not
always
penetrate
to
the
truth
one
is
often
compelled
to
be
guided
by
signs
and
probabilities
and
above
all
by
presumptions
or
prejudices
whereas
it
is
agreed
as
we
have
already
observed
that
mysteries
are
not
probable
for
instance
bayle
will
not
have
it
that
one
can
justify
the
goodness
of
god
in
the
permission
of
sin
because
probability
would
be
against
a
man
that
should
happen
to
be
in
circumstances
comparable
in
our
eyes
to
this
permission
god
foresees
that
eve
will
be
deceived
by
the
serpent
if
he
places
her
in
the
circumstances
wherein
she
later
found
herself
and
nevertheless
he
placed
her
there
now
if
a
father
or
a
guardian
did
the
same
in
regard
to
his
child
or
his
ward
if
a
friend
did
so
in
regard
to
a
young
person
whose
behaviour
was
his
concern
the
judge
would
not
be
satisfied
by
the
excuses
of
an
advocate
who
said
that
the
man
only
permitted
the
evil
without
doing
it
or
willing
it
he
would
rather
take
this
permission
as
a
sign
of
ill
intention
and
would
regard
it
as
a
sin
of
omission
which
would
render
the
one
convicted
thereof
accessary
in
another
sin
of
commission
but
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
when
one
has
foreseen
the
evil
and
has
not
prevented
it
although
it
seems
as
if
one
could
have
done
so
with
ease
and
one
has
even
done
things
that
have
facilitated
it
it
does
not
follow
on
that
account
that
one
is
accessary
thereto
it
is
only
a
very
strong
presumption
such
as
commonly
replaces
truth
in
human
affairs
but
which
would
be
destroyed
by
an
exact
consideration
of
the
facts
supposing
we
were
capable
of
that
in
relation
to
god
for
amongst
lawyers
that
is
called
which
must
provisionally
pass
for
truth
in
case
the
contrary
is
not
proved
and
it
says
more
than
although
the
of
the
academy
has
not
sifted
the
difference
now
there
is
every
reason
to
conclude
unquestionably
that
one
would
find
through
this
consideration
if
only
it
were
attainable
that
reasons
most
just
and
stronger
than
those
which
appear
contrary
to
them
have
compelled
the
to
permit
the
evil
and
even
to
do
things
which
have
facilitated
it
of
this
some
instances
will
be
given
later
it
is
none
too
easy
i
confess
for
a
father
a
guardian
a
friend
to
have
such
reasons
in
the
case
under
consideration
yet
the
thing
is
not
absolutely
impossible
and
a
skilled
writer
of
fiction
might
perchance
find
an
extraordinary
case
that
would
even
justify
a
man
in
the
circumstances
i
have
just
indicated
but
in
reference
to
god
there
is
no
need
to
suppose
or
to
establish
particular
reasons
such
as
may
have
induced
him
to
permit
the
evil
general
reasons
suffice
one
knows
that
he
takes
care
of
the
whole
universe
whereof
all
the
parts
are
connected
and
one
must
thence
infer
that
he
has
had
innumerable
considerations
whose
result
made
him
deem
it
inadvisable
to
prevent
certain
evils
it
should
even
be
concluded
that
there
must
have
been
great
or
rather
invincible
reasons
which
prompted
the
divine
wisdom
to
the
permission
of
the
evil
that
surprises
us
from
the
mere
fact
that
this
permission
has
occurred
for
nothing
can
come
from
god
that
is
not
altogether
consistent
with
goodness
justice
and
holiness
thus
we
can
judge
by
the
event
or
that
the
permission
was
indispensable
although
it
be
not
possible
for
us
to
show
this
by
the
detailed
reasons
that
god
can
have
had
therefor
as
it
is
not
necessary
either
that
we
show
this
to
justify
him
bayle
himself
aptly
says
concerning
that
to
the
questions
of
a
vol
iii
ch
sin
made
its
way
into
the
world
god
therefore
was
able
to
permit
it
without
detriment
to
his
perfections
actu
ad
potentiam
valet
in
god
this
conclusion
holds
good
he
did
this
therefore
he
did
it
well
it
is
not
then
that
we
have
no
notion
of
justice
in
general
fit
to
be
applied
also
to
god
justice
nor
is
it
that
god
justice
has
other
rules
than
the
justice
known
of
men
but
that
the
case
in
question
is
quite
different
from
those
which
are
common
among
men
universal
right
is
the
same
for
god
and
for
men
but
the
question
of
fact
is
quite
different
in
their
case
and
his
we
may
even
assume
or
pretend
as
i
have
already
observed
that
there
is
something
similar
among
men
to
this
circumstance
in
god
actions
a
man
might
give
such
great
and
strong
proofs
of
his
virtue
and
his
holiness
that
all
the
most
apparent
reasons
one
could
put
forward
against
him
to
charge
him
with
an
alleged
crime
for
instance
a
larceny
or
murder
would
deserve
to
be
rejected
as
the
calumnies
of
false
witnesses
or
as
an
extraordinary
play
of
chance
which
sometimes
throws
suspicion
on
the
most
innocent
thus
in
a
case
where
every
other
would
run
the
risk
of
being
condemned
or
put
to
the
torture
according
to
the
laws
of
the
country
this
man
would
be
absolved
by
his
judges
unanimously
now
in
this
case
which
indeed
is
rare
but
which
is
not
impossible
one
might
say
in
a
sense
that
there
is
a
conflict
between
reason
and
faith
and
that
the
rules
of
law
are
other
in
respect
of
this
person
than
they
are
in
respect
of
the
remainder
of
mankind
but
that
when
explained
will
signify
only
that
appearances
of
reason
here
give
way
before
the
faith
that
is
due
to
the
word
and
the
integrity
of
this
great
and
holy
man
and
that
he
is
privileged
above
other
men
not
indeed
as
if
there
were
one
law
for
others
and
another
for
him
nor
as
if
one
had
no
understanding
of
what
justice
is
in
relation
to
him
it
is
rather
because
the
rules
of
universal
justice
do
not
find
here
the
application
that
they
receive
elsewhere
or
because
they
favour
him
instead
of
accusing
him
since
there
are
in
this
personage
qualities
so
admirable
that
by
virtue
of
a
good
logic
of
probabilities
one
should
place
more
faith
in
his
word
than
in
that
of
many
others
since
it
is
permitted
here
to
imagine
possible
cases
may
one
not
suppose
this
incomparable
man
to
be
the
adept
or
the
possessor
of
blessed
to
enrich
all
earthly
kings
and
that
he
spends
every
day
prodigious
sums
in
order
to
feed
and
to
rescue
from
distress
countless
numbers
of
poor
men
be
there
never
so
many
witnesses
or
appearances
of
every
kind
tending
to
prove
that
this
great
benefactor
of
the
human
race
has
just
committed
some
larceny
is
it
not
true
that
the
whole
earth
would
make
mock
of
the
accusation
however
specious
it
might
be
now
god
is
infinitely
above
the
goodness
and
the
power
of
this
man
and
consequently
there
are
no
reasons
at
all
however
apparent
they
be
that
can
hold
good
against
faith
that
is
against
the
assurance
or
the
confidence
in
god
wherewith
we
can
and
ought
to
say
that
god
has
done
all
things
well
the
objections
are
therefore
not
insoluble
they
only
involve
prejudices
and
probabilities
which
are
however
overthrown
by
reasons
incomparably
stronger
one
must
not
say
either
that
what
we
call
is
nothing
in
relation
to
god
that
he
is
the
absolute
master
of
all
things
even
to
the
point
of
being
able
to
condemn
the
innocent
without
violating
his
justice
or
finally
that
justice
is
something
arbitrary
where
he
is
concerned
those
are
rash
and
dangerous
expressions
whereunto
some
have
been
led
astray
to
the
discredit
of
the
attributes
of
god
for
if
such
were
the
case
there
would
be
no
reason
for
praising
his
goodness
and
his
justice
rather
would
it
be
as
if
the
most
wicked
spirit
the
prince
of
evil
genii
the
evil
principle
of
the
manichaeans
were
the
sole
master
of
the
universe
just
as
i
observed
before
what
means
would
there
be
of
distinguishing
the
true
god
from
the
false
god
of
zoroaster
if
all
things
depended
upon
the
caprice
of
an
arbitrary
power
and
there
were
neither
rule
nor
consideration
for
anything
whatever
it
is
therefore
more
than
evident
that
nothing
compels
us
to
commit
ourselves
to
a
doctrine
so
strange
since
it
suffices
to
say
that
we
have
not
enough
knowledge
of
the
facts
when
there
is
a
question
of
answering
probabilities
which
appear
to
throw
doubt
upon
the
justice
and
the
goodness
of
god
and
which
would
vanish
away
if
the
facts
were
well
known
to
us
we
need
neither
renounce
reason
in
order
to
listen
to
faith
nor
blind
ourselves
in
order
to
see
clearly
as
queen
christine
used
to
say
it
is
enough
to
reject
ordinary
appearances
when
they
are
contrary
to
mysteries
and
this
is
not
contrary
to
reason
since
even
in
natural
things
we
are
very
often
undeceived
about
appearances
either
by
experience
or
by
superior
reasons
all
that
has
been
set
down
here
in
advance
only
with
the
object
of
showing
more
plainly
wherein
the
fault
of
the
objections
and
the
abuse
of
reason
consists
in
the
present
case
where
the
claim
is
made
that
reason
has
greatest
force
against
faith
we
shall
come
afterwards
to
a
more
exact
discussion
of
that
which
concerns
the
origin
of
evil
and
the
permission
of
sin
with
its
consequences
for
now
it
will
be
well
to
continue
our
examination
of
the
important
question
of
the
use
of
reason
in
theology
and
to
make
reflexions
upon
what
bayle
has
said
thereon
in
divers
passages
of
his
works
as
he
paid
particular
attention
in
his
and
critical
to
expounding
the
objections
of
the
manichaeans
and
those
of
the
pyrrhonians
and
as
this
procedure
had
been
criticized
by
some
persons
zealous
for
religion
he
placed
a
dissertation
at
the
end
of
the
second
edition
of
this
which
aimed
at
showing
by
examples
by
authorities
and
by
reasons
the
innocence
and
usefulness
of
his
course
of
action
i
am
persuaded
as
i
have
said
above
that
the
specious
objections
one
can
urge
against
truth
are
very
useful
and
that
they
serve
to
confirm
and
to
illumine
it
giving
opportunity
to
intelligent
persons
to
find
new
openings
or
to
turn
the
old
to
better
account
but
bayle
seeks
therein
a
usefulness
quite
the
reverse
of
this
it
would
be
that
of
displaying
the
power
of
faith
by
showing
that
the
truths
it
teaches
can
not
sustain
the
attacks
of
reason
and
that
it
nevertheless
holds
its
own
in
the
heart
of
the
faithful
nicole
seems
to
call
that
triumph
of
god
authority
over
human
reason
in
the
words
of
his
quoted
by
bayle
in
the
third
volume
of
his
to
the
questions
of
a
ch
but
since
reason
is
a
gift
of
god
even
as
faith
is
contention
between
them
would
cause
god
to
contend
against
god
and
if
the
objections
of
reason
against
any
article
of
faith
are
insoluble
then
it
must
be
said
that
this
alleged
article
will
be
false
and
not
revealed
this
will
be
a
chimera
of
the
human
mind
and
the
triumph
of
this
faith
will
be
capable
of
comparison
with
bonfires
lighted
after
a
defeat
such
is
the
doctrine
of
the
damnation
of
unbaptized
children
which
nicole
would
have
us
assume
to
be
a
consequence
of
original
sin
such
would
be
the
eternal
damnation
of
adults
lacking
the
light
that
is
necessary
for
the
attainment
of
salvation
yet
everyone
need
not
enter
into
theological
discussions
and
persons
whose
condition
allows
not
of
exact
researches
should
be
content
with
instruction
on
faith
without
being
disturbed
by
the
objections
and
if
some
exceeding
great
difficulty
should
happen
to
strike
them
it
is
permitted
to
them
to
avert
the
mind
from
it
offering
to
god
a
sacrifice
of
their
curiosity
for
when
one
is
assured
of
a
truth
one
has
no
need
to
listen
to
the
objections
as
there
are
many
people
whose
faith
is
rather
small
and
shallow
to
withstand
such
dangerous
tests
i
think
one
must
not
present
them
with
that
which
might
be
poisonous
for
them
or
if
one
can
not
hide
from
them
what
is
only
too
public
the
antidote
must
be
added
to
it
that
is
to
say
one
must
try
to
add
the
answer
to
the
objection
certainly
not
withhold
it
as
unobtainable
the
passages
from
the
excellent
theologians
who
speak
of
this
triumph
of
faith
can
and
should
receive
a
meaning
appropriate
to
the
principles
i
have
just
affirmed
there
appear
in
some
objects
of
faith
two
great
qualities
capable
of
making
it
triumph
over
reason
the
one
is
the
other
is
lack
of
but
one
must
beware
of
adding
thereto
the
third
quality
whereof
bayle
speaks
and
of
saying
that
what
one
believes
is
for
that
would
be
to
cause
reason
in
its
turn
to
triumph
in
a
manner
that
would
destroy
faith
incomprehensibility
does
not
prevent
us
from
believing
even
natural
truths
for
instance
as
i
have
already
pointed
out
we
do
not
comprehend
the
nature
of
odours
and
savours
and
yet
we
are
persuaded
by
a
kind
of
faith
which
we
owe
to
the
evidence
of
the
senses
that
these
perceptible
qualities
are
founded
upon
the
nature
of
things
and
that
they
are
not
illusions
there
are
also
things
contrary
to
appearances
which
we
admit
when
they
are
sufficiently
verified
there
is
a
little
romance
of
spanish
origin
whose
title
states
that
one
must
not
always
believe
what
one
sees
what
was
there
more
specious
than
the
lie
of
the
false
martin
guerre
who
was
acknowledged
as
the
true
martin
by
the
true
martin
wife
and
relatives
and
caused
the
judges
and
the
relatives
to
waver
for
a
long
time
even
after
the
arrival
of
the
other
nevertheless
the
truth
was
known
in
the
end
it
is
the
same
with
faith
i
have
already
observed
that
all
one
can
oppose
to
the
goodness
and
the
justice
of
god
is
nothing
but
appearances
which
would
be
strong
against
a
man
but
which
are
nullified
when
they
are
applied
to
god
and
when
they
are
weighed
against
the
proofs
that
assure
us
of
the
infinite
perfection
of
his
attributes
thus
faith
triumphs
over
false
reasons
by
means
of
sound
and
superior
reasons
that
have
made
us
embrace
it
but
it
would
not
triumph
if
the
contrary
opinion
had
for
it
reasons
as
strong
as
or
even
stronger
than
those
which
form
the
foundation
of
faith
that
is
if
there
were
invincible
and
conclusive
objections
against
faith
it
is
well
also
to
observe
here
that
what
bayle
calls
a
of
faith
is
in
part
a
triumph
of
demonstrative
reason
against
apparent
and
deceptive
reasons
which
are
improperly
set
against
the
demonstrations
for
it
must
be
taken
into
consideration
that
the
objections
of
the
manichaeans
are
hardly
less
contrary
to
natural
theology
than
to
revealed
theology
and
supposing
one
surrendered
to
them
holy
scripture
original
sin
the
grace
of
god
in
jesus
christ
the
pains
of
hell
and
the
other
articles
of
our
religion
one
would
not
even
so
be
delivered
from
their
objections
for
one
can
not
deny
that
there
is
in
the
world
physical
evil
that
is
suffering
and
moral
evil
that
is
crime
and
even
that
physical
evil
is
not
always
distributed
here
on
earth
according
to
the
proportion
of
moral
evil
as
it
seems
that
justice
demands
there
remains
then
this
question
of
natural
theology
how
a
sole
principle
and
has
been
able
to
admit
evil
and
especially
to
permit
sin
and
how
it
could
resolve
to
make
the
wicked
often
happy
and
the
good
unhappy
now
we
have
no
need
of
revealed
faith
to
know
that
there
is
such
a
sole
principle
of
all
things
entirely
good
and
wise
reason
teaches
us
this
by
infallible
proofs
and
in
consequence
all
the
objections
taken
from
the
course
of
things
in
which
we
observe
imperfections
are
only
based
on
false
appearances
for
if
we
were
capable
of
understanding
the
universal
harmony
we
should
see
that
what
we
are
tempted
to
find
fault
with
is
connected
with
the
plan
most
worthy
of
being
chosen
in
a
word
we
and
should
not
only
that
what
god
has
done
is
the
best
i
call
here
what
one
knows
by
the
causes
and
what
one
only
judges
by
the
effects
even
though
the
one
be
as
certainly
known
as
the
other
and
one
can
apply
here
too
the
saying
of
paul
cor
that
we
walk
by
and
not
by
for
the
infinite
wisdom
of
god
being
known
to
us
we
conclude
that
the
evils
we
experience
had
to
be
permitted
and
this
we
conclude
from
the
effect
or
that
is
to
say
because
they
exist
it
is
what
bayle
acknowledges
and
he
ought
to
content
himself
with
that
and
not
claim
that
one
must
put
an
end
to
the
false
appearances
which
are
contrary
thereto
it
is
as
if
one
asked
that
there
should
be
no
more
dreams
or
optical
illusions
and
it
is
not
to
be
doubted
that
this
faith
and
this
confidence
in
god
who
gives
us
insight
into
his
infinite
goodness
and
prepares
us
for
his
love
in
spite
of
the
appearances
of
harshness
that
may
repel
us
are
an
admirable
exercise
for
the
virtues
of
christian
theology
when
the
divine
grace
in
jesus
christ
arouses
these
motions
within
us
that
is
what
luther
aptly
observed
in
opposition
to
erasmus
saying
that
it
is
love
in
the
highest
degree
to
love
him
who
to
flesh
and
blood
appears
so
unlovable
so
harsh
toward
the
unfortunate
and
so
ready
to
condemn
and
to
condemn
for
evils
in
which
he
appears
to
be
the
cause
or
accessary
at
least
in
the
eyes
of
those
who
allow
themselves
to
be
dazzled
by
false
reasons
one
may
therefore
say
that
the
triumph
of
true
reason
illumined
by
divine
grace
is
at
the
same
time
the
triumph
of
faith
and
love
bayle
appears
to
have
taken
the
matter
quite
otherwise
he
declares
himself
against
reason
when
he
might
have
been
content
to
censure
its
abuse
he
quotes
the
words
of
cotta
in
cicero
where
he
goes
so
far
as
to
say
that
if
reason
were
a
gift
of
the
gods
providence
would
be
to
blame
for
having
given
it
since
it
tends
to
our
harm
bayle
also
thinks
that
human
reason
is
a
source
of
destruction
and
not
of
edification
and
critical
that
it
is
a
runner
who
knows
not
where
to
stop
and
who
like
another
penelope
herself
destroys
her
own
work
aedificat

to

iii
but
he
takes
pains
especially
to
pile
up
many
authorities
one
upon
the
other
in
order
to
show
that
theologians
of
all
parties
reject
the
use
of
reason
just
as
he
does
and
that
they
call
attention
to
such
gleams
of
reason
as
oppose
religion
only
that
they
may
sacrifice
them
to
faith
by
a
mere
repudiation
answering
nothing
but
the
conclusion
of
the
argument
that
is
brought
against
them
he
begins

and
to

lose

for
the
fathers
of

church
bayle
refers
us
to
the
collection
of
passages
from
them
against
the
use
of
philosophy
and
of
reason
which
de
launoy
made
varia
aristotelis
fortuna
cap
and
especially
to
the
passages
from
augustine
collected
by
arnauld
against
mallet
which
state
that
the
judgements
of
god
are
inscrutable
that
they
are
not
any
the
less
just
for
that
they
are
unknown
to
us
that
it
is
a
deep
abyss
which
one
can
not
fathom
without
running
the
risk
of
falling
down
the
precipice
that
one
can
not
without
temerity
try
to
elucidate
that
which
god
willed
to
keep
hidden
that
his
will
can
not
but
be
just
that
many
men
having
tried
to
explain
this
incomprehensible
depth
have
fallen
into
vain
imaginations
and
opinions
full
of
error
and
bewilderment
the
schoolmen
have
spoken
in
like
manner
bayle
quotes
a
beautiful
passage
from
cardinal
cajetan
part
i
qu
art
to
this
effect
mind
he
says
not
upon
the
evidence
of
known
truth
but
upon
the
impenetrable
depth
of
hidden
truth
and
as
gregory
says
he
who
believes
touching
the
divinity
only
that
which
he
can
gauge
with
his
mind
belittles
the
idea
of
god
yet
i
do
not
surmise
that
it
is
necessary
to
deny
any
of
the
things
which
we
know
or
which
we
see
as
appertaining
to
the
immutability
the
actuality
the
certainty
the
universality
of
god
but
i
think
that
there
is
here
some
secret
either
in
regard
to
the
relation
which
exists
between
god
and
the
event
or
in
respect
of
what
connects
the
event
itself
with
his
prevision
thus
reflecting
that
the
understanding
of
our
soul
is
the
eye
of
the
owl
i
find
the
soul
repose
only
in
ignorance
for
it
is
better
both
for
the
catholic
faith
and
for
philosophic
faith
to
confess
our
blindness
than
to
affirm
as
evident
what
does
not
afford
our
mind
the
contentment
which
gives
i
do
not
accuse
of
presumption
on
that
account
all
the
learned
men
who
stammeringly
have
endeavoured
to
suggest
as
far
as
in
them
lay
the
immobility
and
the
sovereign
and
eternal
efficacy
of
the
understanding
of
the
will
and
of
the
power
of
god
through
the
infallibility
of
divine
election
and
divine
relation
to
all
events
nothing
of
all
that
interferes
with
my
surmise
that
there
is
some
depth
which
is
hidden
from
us
this
passage
of
cajetan
is
all
the
more
notable
since
he
was
an
author
competent
to
reach
the
heart
of
the
matter
luther
book
against
erasmus
is
full
of
vigorous
comments
hostile
to
those
who
desire
to
submit
revealed
truths
to
the
tribunal
of
our
reason
calvin
often
speaks
in
the
same
tone
against
the
inquisitive
daring
of
those
who
seek
to
penetrate
into
the
counsels
of
god
he
declares
in
his
treatise
on
predestination
that
god
had
just
causes
for
damning
some
men
but
causes
unknown
to
us
finally
bayle
quotes
sundry
modern
writers
who
have
spoken
to
the
same
effect
to
the
questions
of
a
ch
et
but
all
these
expressions
and
innumerable
others
like
them
do
not
prove
that
the
objections
opposed
to
faith
are
so
insoluble
as
bayle
supposes
it
is
true
that
the
counsels
of
god
are
inscrutable
but
there
is
no
invincible
objection
which
tends
to
the
conclusion
that
they
are
unjust
what
appears
injustice
on
the
part
of
god
and
foolishness
in
our
faith
only
appears
so
the
famous
passage
of
tertullian
carne
est
dei
filius
credibile
est
quia
ineptum
est
et
sepultus
revixit
certum
est
quia
impossibile
is
a
sally
that
can
only
be
meant
to
concern
appearances
of
absurdity
there
are
others
like
them
in
book
on
in
as
when
he
says
ch
placet
tibi
deus
indignos
coronans
non
debet
displicere
immeritos
damnans
which
being
reduced
to
more
temperate
phrasing
means
if
you
approve
that
god
give
eternal
glory
to
those
who
are
not
better
than
the
rest
you
should
not
disapprove
that
he
abandon
those
who
are
not
worse
than
the
rest
and
to
judge
that
he
speaks
only
of
appearances
of
injustice
one
only
has
to
weigh
these
words
of
the
same
author
taken
from
the
same
book
all
the
rest
he
says
recognize
in
god
a
supreme
majesty
there
is
only
justice
that
we
dare
to
question
and
we
will
not
believe
provisionally
tantisper
that
he
is
just
albeit
he
has
promised
us
that
the
time
shall
come
when
his
glory
being
revealed
all
men
shall
see
clearly
that
he
has
been
and
that
he
is
just
it
will
be
found
also
that
when
the
fathers
entered
into
a
discussion
they
did
not
simply
reject
reason
and
in
disputations
with
the
pagans
they
endeavour
usually
to
show
how
paganism
is
contrary
to
reason
and
how
the
christian
religion
has
the
better
of
it
on
that
side
also
origen
showed
celsus
how
reasonable
christianity
is
and
why
notwithstanding
the
majority
of
christians
should
believe
without
examination
celsus
had
jeered
at
the
behaviour
of
christians
willing
he
said
to
listen
to
your
reasons
nor
to
give
you
any
for
what
they
believe
are
content
to
say
to
you
examine
not
only
believe
or
your
faith
will
save
you
and
they
hold
this
as
a
maxim
that
the
wisdom
of
the
world
is
an
evil
origen
gives
the
answer
of
a
wise
man
and
in
conformity
with
the
principles
we
have
established
in
the
matter
for
reason
far
from
being
contrary
to
christianity
serves
as
a
foundation
for
this
religion
and
will
bring
about
its
acceptance
by
those
who
can
achieve
the
examination
of
it
but
as
few
people
are
capable
of
this
the
heavenly
gift
of
plain
faith
tending
towards
good
suffices
for
men
in
general
it
were
possible
he
says
all
men
neglecting
the
affairs
of
life
to
apply
themselves
to
study
and
meditation
one
need
seek
no
other
way
to
make
them
accept
the
christian
religion
for
to
say
nothing
likely
to
offend
he
insinuates
that
the
pagan
religion
is
absurd
but
he
will
not
say
so
explicitly
will
be
found
therein
no
less
exactitude
than
elsewhere
whether
in
the
discussion
of
its
dogmas
or
in
the
elucidation
of
the
enigmatical
expressions
of
its
prophets
or
in
the
interpretation
of
the
parables
of
its
gospels
and
of
countless
other
things
happening
or
ordained
symbolically
but
since
neither
the
necessities
of
life
nor
the
infirmities
of
men
permit
of
this
application
to
study
save
for
a
very
small
number
of
persons
what
means
could
one
find
more
qualified
to
benefit
everyone
else
in
the
world
than
those
jesus
christ
wished
to
be
used
for
the
conversion
of
the
nations
and
i
would
fain
ask
with
regard
to
the
great
number
of
those
who
believe
and
who
thereby
have
withdrawn
themselves
from
the
quagmire
of
vices
wherein
before
they
were
plunged
which
would
be
the
better
to
have
thus
changed
one
morals
and
reformed
one
life
believing
without
examination
that
there
are
punishments
for
sin
and
rewards
for
good
actions
or
to
have
waited
for
one
conversion
until
one
not
only
believed
but
had
examined
with
care
the
foundations
of
these
dogmas
it
is
certain
that
were
this
method
to
be
followed
few
indeed
would
reach
that
point
whither
they
are
led
by
their
plain
and
simple
faith
but
the
majority
would
remain
in
their
corruption
bayle
in
his
explanation
concerning
the
objections
of
the
manichaeans
placed
at
the
end
of
the
second
edition
of
the
takes
those
words
where
origen
points
out
that
religion
can
stand
the
test
of
having
her
dogmas
discussed
as
if
it
were
not
meant
in
relation
to
philosophy
but
only
in
relation
to
the
accuracy
wherewith
the
authority
and
the
true
meaning
of
holy
scripture
is
established
but
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
this
restriction
origen
wrote
against
a
philosopher
whom
such
a
restriction
would
not
have
suited
and
it
appears
that
this
father
wished
to
point
out
that
among
christians
there
was
no
less
exactitude
than
among
the
stoics
and
some
other
philosophers
who
established
their
doctrine
as
much
by
reason
as
by
authorities
as
for
example
chrysippus
did
who
found
his
philosophy
even
in
the
symbols
of
pagan
antiquity
celsus
brings
up
still
another
objection
to
the
christians
in
the
same
place
they
withdraw
he
says
into
their
examine
not
only
believe
they
must
tell
me
at
least
what
are
the
things
they
wish
me
to
believe
therein
he
is
doubtless
right
and
that
tells
against
those
who
would
say
that
god
is
good
and
just
and
who
yet
would
maintain
that
we
have
no
notion
of
goodness
and
of
justice
when
we
attribute
these
perfections
to
him
but
one
must
not
always
demand
what
i
call
notions
involving
nothing
that
is
not
explained
since
even
perceptible
qualities
like
heat
light
sweetness
can
not
give
us
such
notions
thus
we
agreed
that
mysteries
should
receive
an
explanation
but
this
explanation
is
imperfect
it
suffices
for
us
to
have
some
analogical
understanding
of
a
mystery
such
as
the
trinity
and
the
incarnation
to
the
end
that
in
accepting
them
we
pronounce
not
words
altogether
devoid
of
meaning
but
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
explanation
go
as
far
as
we
would
wish
that
is
to
the
extent
of
comprehension
and
to
the
it
appears
strange
therefore
that
bayle
rejects
the
tribunal
of
in
the
third
volume
of
his
to
the
questions
of
a
pp
and
as
if
one
should
not
consult
the
idea
of
goodness
in
answering
the
manichaeans
whereas
he
had
declared
himself
quite
differently
in
his
of
necessity
there
must
be
agreement
upon
the
meaning
of
and
amongst
those
who
are
in
dispute
over
the
question
whether
there
is
only
one
principle
altogether
good
or
whether
there
are
two
the
one
good
and
the
other
bad
we
understand
something
by
union
when
we
are
told
of
the
union
of
one
body
with
another
or
of
a
substance
with
its
accident
of
a
subject
with
its
adjunct
of
the
place
with
the
moving
body
of
the
act
with
the
potency
we
also
mean
something
when
we
speak
of
the
union
of
the
soul
with
the
body
to
make
thereof
one
single
person
for
albeit
i
do
not
hold
that
the
soul
changes
the
laws
of
the
body
or
that
the
body
changes
the
laws
of
the
soul
and
i
have
introduced
the
harmony
to
avoid
this
derangement
i
nevertheless
admit
a
true
union
between
the
soul
and
the
body
which
makes
thereof
a
suppositum
this
union
belongs
to
the
metaphysical
whereas
a
union
of
influence
would
belong
to
the
physical
but
when
we
speak
of
the
union
of
the
word
of
god
with
human
nature
we
should
be
content
with
an
analogical
knowledge
such
as
the
comparison
of
the
union
of
the
soul
with
the
body
is
capable
of
giving
us
we
should
moreover
be
content
to
say
that
the
incarnation
is
the
closest
union
that
can
exist
between
the
creator
and
the
creature
and
further
we
should
not
want
to
go
it
is
the
same
with
the
other
mysteries
where
moderate
minds
will
ever
find
an
explanation
sufficient
for
belief
but
never
such
as
would
be
necessary
for
understanding
a
certain
it
greek
ti
esti
is
enough
for
us
but
the
greek
pôs
is
beyond
us
and
is
not
necessary
for
us
one
may
say
concerning
the
explanations
of
mysteries
which
are
given
out
here
and
there
what
the
queen
of
sweden
inscribed
upon
a
medal
concerning
the
crown
she
had
abandoned
mi
bisogna
e
non
mi
basta
nor
have
we
any
need
either
as
i
have
already
observed
to
prove
the
mysteries
or
to
give
a
reason
for
them
it
suffices
us
the
thing
is
greek
to
hoti
even
though
we
know
not
the
greek
to
dioti
which
god
has
reserved
for
himself
these
lines
written
on
that
theme
by
joseph
scaliger
are
beautiful

bayle
who
quotes
them
to
the
questions
of
a
vol
iii
holds
the
likely
opinion
that
scaliger
made
them
upon
the
disputes
between
arminius
and
gomarus
i
think
bayle
repeated
them
from
memory
for
he
put
instead
of
but
it
is
apparently
the
printer
fault
that
stands
in
place
of
that
is
modestly
which
the
metre
requires
nothing
can
be
more
judicious
than
the
warning
these
lines
contain
and
bayle
is
right
in
saying
that
those
who
claim
that
the
behaviour
of
god
with
respect
to
sin
and
the
consequences
of
sin
contains
nothing
but
what
they
can
account
for
deliver
themselves
up
to
the
mercy
of
their
adversary
but
he
is
not
right
in
combining
here
two
very
different
things
account
for
a
thing
and
uphold
it
against
objections
as
he
does
when
he
presently
adds
are
obliged
to
follow
him
their
adversary
everywhere
whither
he
shall
wish
to
lead
them
and
it
would
be
to
retire
ignominiously
and
ask
for
quarter
if
they
were
to
admit
that
our
intelligence
is
too
weak
to
remove
completely
all
the
objections
advanced
by
a
philosopher
it
seems
here
that
according
to
bayle
for
comes
short
of
objections
since
he
threatens
one
who
should
undertake
the
first
with
the
resulting
obligation
to
pass
on
to
the
second
but
it
is
quite
the
opposite
he
who
maintains
a
thesis
the
is
not
bound
to
account
for
it
but
he
is
bound
to
meet
the
objections
of
an
opponent
a
defendant
in
law
is
not
bound
as
a
general
rule
to
prove
his
right
or
to
produce
his
title
to
possession
but
he
is
obliged
to
reply
to
the
arguments
of
the
plaintiff
i
have
marvelled
many
times
that
a
writer
so
precise
and
so
shrewd
as
bayle
so
often
here
confuses
things
where
so
much
difference
exists
as
between
these
three
acts
of
reason
to
comprehend
to
prove
and
to
answer
objections
as
if
when
it
is
a
question
of
the
use
of
reason
in
theology
one
term
were
as
good
as
another
thus
he
says
in
his
posthumous
conversations
is
no
principle
which
bayle
has
more
often
inculcated
than
this
that
the
incomprehensibility
of
a
dogma
and
the
insolubility
of
the
objections
that
oppose
it
provide
no
legitimate
reason
for
rejecting
it
this
is
true
as
regards
the
incomprehensibility
but
it
is
not
the
same
with
the
insolubility
and
it
is
indeed
just
as
if
one
said
that
an
invincible
reason
against
a
thesis
was
not
a
legitimate
reason
for
rejecting
it
for
what
other
legitimate
reason
for
rejecting
an
opinion
can
one
find
if
an
invincible
opposing
argument
is
not
such
an
one
and
what
means
shall
one
have
thereafter
of
demonstrating
the
falsity
and
even
the
absurdity
of
any
opinion
it
is
well
to
observe
also
that
he
who
proves
a
thing
accounts
for
it
through
the
efficient
cause
and
whosoever
can
thus
account
for
it
in
a
precise
and
adequate
manner
is
also
in
a
position
to
comprehend
the
thing
therefore
it
was
that
the
scholastic
theologians
had
already
censured
raymond
lully
for
having
undertaken
to
demonstrate
the
trinity
by
philosophy
this
demonstration
is
to
be
found
in
his
and
bartholomaeus
keckermann
a
writer
renowned
in
the
reformed
party
having
made
an
attempt
of
just
the
same
kind
upon
the
same
mystery
has
been
no
less
censured
for
it
by
some
modern
theologians
therefore
censure
will
fall
upon
those
who
shall
wish
to
account
for
this
mystery
and
make
it
comprehensible
but
praise
will
be
given
to
those
who
shall
toil
to
uphold
it
against
the
objections
of
adversaries
i
have
said
already
that
theologians
usually
distinguish
between
what
is
above
reason
and
what
is
against
reason
they
place
reason
that
which
one
can
not
comprehend
and
which
one
can
not
account
for
but
reason
will
be
all
opinion
that
is
opposed
by
invincible
reasons
or
the
contrary
of
which
can
be
proved
in
a
precise
and
sound
manner
they
avow
therefore
that
the
mysteries
are
above
reason
but
they
do
not
admit
that
they
are
contrary
to
it
the
english
author
of
a
book
which
is
ingenious
but
has
met
with
disapproval
entitled
not
wished
to
combat
this
distinction
but
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
he
has
at
all
weakened
it
bayle
also
is
not
quite
satisfied
with
this
accepted
distinction
this
is
what
he
says
on
the
matter
vol
iii
of
the
to
the
questions
of
a
ch
firstly
he
distinguishes
together
with
saurin
between
these
two
theses
the
one
the
dogmas
of
christianity
are
in
conformity
with
the
other
reason
knows
that
they
are
in
conformity
with
he
affirms
the
first
and
denies
the
second
i
am
of
the
same
opinion
if
in
saying
a
dogma
conforms
to
reason
one
means
that
it
is
possible
to
account
for
it
or
to
explain
its
by
reason
for
god
could
doubtless
do
so
and
we
can
not
but
i
think
that
one
must
affirm
both
theses
if
by
that
a
dogma
conforms
to
reason
one
means
that
we
can
demonstrate
if
need
be
that
there
is
no
contradiction
between
this
dogma
and
reason
repudiating
the
objections
of
those
who
maintain
that
this
dogma
is
an
absurdity
bayle
explains
himself
here
in
a
manner
not
at
all
convincing
he
acknowledges
fully
that
our
mysteries
are
in
accordance
with
the
supreme
and
universal
reason
that
is
in
the
divine
understanding
or
with
reason
in
general
yet
he
denies
that
they
are
in
accordance
with
that
part
of
reason
which
man
employs
to
judge
things
but
this
portion
of
reason
which
we
possess
is
a
gift
of
god
and
consists
in
the
natural
light
that
has
remained
with
us
in
the
midst
of
corruption
thus
it
is
in
accordance
with
the
whole
and
it
differs
from
that
which
is
in
god
only
as
a
drop
of
water
differs
from
the
ocean
or
rather
as
the
finite
from
the
infinite
therefore
mysteries
may
transcend
it
but
they
can
not
be
contrary
to
it
one
can
not
be
contrary
to
one
part
without
being
contrary
to
the
whole
that
which
contradicts
a
proposition
of
euclid
is
contrary
to
the
of
euclid
that
which
in
us
is
contrary
to
the
mysteries
is
not
reason
nor
is
it
the
natural
light
or
the
linking
together
of
truths
it
is
corruption
or
error
or
prejudice
or
darkness
bayle
is
not
satisfied
with
the
opinion
of
josua
stegman
and
of
turretin
protestant
theologians
who
teach
that
the
mysteries
are
contrary
only
to
corrupt
reason
he
asks
mockingly
whether
by
right
reason
is
meant
perchance
that
of
an
orthodox
theologian
and
by
corrupt
reason
that
of
an
heretic
and
he
urges
the
objection
that
the
evidence
of
the
mystery
of
the
trinity
was
no
greater
in
the
soul
of
luther
than
in
the
soul
of
socinius
but
as
descartes
has
well
observed
good
sense
is
distributed
to
all
thus
one
must
believe
that
both
the
orthodox
and
heretics
are
endowed
therewith
right
reason
is
a
linking
together
of
truths
corrupt
reason
is
mixed
with
prejudices
and
passions
and
in
order
to
discriminate
between
the
two
one
need
but
proceed
in
good
order
admit
no
thesis
without
proof
and
admit
no
proof
unless
it
be
in
proper
form
according
to
the
commonest
rules
of
logic
one
needs
neither
any
other
criterion
nor
other
arbitrator
in
questions
of
reason
it
is
only
through
lack
of
this
consideration
that
a
handle
has
been
given
to
the
sceptics
and
that
even
in
theology
françois
véron
and
some
others
who
exacerbated
the
dispute
with
the
protestants
even
to
the
point
of
dishonesty
plunged
headlong
into
scepticism
in
order
to
prove
the
necessity
of
accepting
an
infallible
external
judge
their
course
meets
with
no
approval
from
the
most
expert
even
in
their
own
party
calixtus
and
daillé
derided
it
as
it
deserved
and
bellarmine
argued
quite
otherwise
now
let
us
come
to
what
bayle
says
on
the
distinction
we
are
concerned
with
seems
to
me
he
says
an
ambiguity
has
crept
into
the
celebrated
distinction
drawn
between
things
that
are
above
reason
and
things
that
are
against
reason
the
mysteries
of
the
gospel
are
above
reason
so
it
is
usually
said
but
they
are
not
contrary
to
reason
i
think
that
the
same
sense
is
not
given
to
the
word
reason
in
the
first
part
of
this
axiom
as
in
the
second
by
the
first
is
understood
rather
the
reason
of
man
or
reason
and
by
the
second
reason
in
general
or
reason
for
supposing
that
it
is
understood
always
as
reason
in
general
or
the
supreme
reason
the
universal
reason
that
is
in
god
it
is
equally
true
that
the
mysteries
of
the
gospels
are
not
above
reason
and
that
they
are
not
against
reason
but
if
in
both
parts
of
the
axiom
human
reason
is
meant
i
do
not
clearly
see
the
soundness
of
the
distinction
for
the
most
orthodox
confess
that
we
know
not
how
our
mysteries
can
conform
to
the
maxims
of
philosophy
it
seems
to
us
therefore
that
they
are
not
in
conformity
with
our
reason
now
that
which
appears
to
us
not
to
be
in
conformity
with
our
reason
appears
contrary
to
our
reason
just
as
that
which
appears
to
us
not
in
conformity
with
truth
appears
contrary
to
truth
thus
why
should
not
one
say
equally
that
the
mysteries
are
against
our
feeble
reason
and
that
they
are
above
our
feeble
reason
i
answer
as
i
have
done
already
that
here
is
the
linking
together
of
the
truths
that
we
know
by
the
light
of
nature
and
in
this
sense
the
axiom
is
true
and
without
any
ambiguity
the
mysteries
transcend
our
reason
since
they
contain
truths
that
are
not
comprised
in
this
sequence
but
they
are
not
contrary
to
our
reason
and
they
do
not
contradict
any
of
the
truths
whereto
this
sequence
can
lead
us
accordingly
there
is
no
question
here
of
the
universal
reason
that
is
in
god
but
of
our
reason
as
for
the
question
whether
we
know
the
mysteries
to
conform
with
our
reason
i
answer
that
at
least
we
never
know
of
any
or
any
opposition
between
the
mysteries
and
reason
moreover
we
can
always
abolish
such
alleged
opposition
and
so
if
this
can
be
called
reconciling
or
harmonizing
faith
with
reason
or
recognizing
the
conformity
between
them
it
must
be
said
that
we
can
recognize
this
conformity
and
this
harmony
but
if
the
conformity
consists
in
a
reasonable
explanation
of
the
we
can
not
recognize
it
bayle
makes
one
more
ingenious
objection
which
he
draws
from
the
example
of
the
sense
of
sight
a
square
tower
he
says
a
distance
appears
to
us
round
our
eyes
testify
very
clearly
not
only
that
they
perceive
nothing
square
in
this
tower
but
also
that
they
discover
there
a
round
shape
incompatible
with
the
square
shape
one
may
therefore
say
that
the
truth
which
is
the
square
shape
is
not
only
above
but
even
against
the
witness
of
our
feeble
sight
it
must
be
admitted
that
this
observation
is
correct
and
although
it
be
true
that
the
appearance
of
roundness
comes
simply
from
the
effacement
of
the
angles
which
distance
causes
to
disappear
it
is
true
notwithstanding
that
the
round
and
the
square
are
opposites
therefore
my
answer
to
this
objection
is
that
the
representation
of
the
senses
even
when
they
do
all
that
in
them
lies
is
often
contrary
to
the
truth
but
it
is
not
the
same
with
the
faculty
of
reasoning
when
it
does
its
duty
since
a
strictly
reasoned
argument
is
nothing
but
a
linking
together
of
truths
and
as
for
the
sense
of
sight
in
particular
it
is
well
to
consider
that
there
are
yet
other
false
appearances
which
come
not
from
the
of
our
eyes
nor
from
the
loss
of
visibility
brought
about
by
distance
but
from
the
very
of
however
perfect
it
be
it
is
thus
for
instance
that
the
circle
seen
sideways
is
changed
into
that
kind
of
oval
which
among
geometricians
is
known
as
an
ellipse
and
sometimes
even
into
a
parabola
or
a
hyperbola
or
actually
into
a
straight
line
witness
the
ring
of
saturn
the
senses
properly
speaking
do
not
deceive
us
it
is
our
inner
sense
which
often
makes
us
go
too
fast
that
occurs
also
in
brute
beasts
as
when
a
dog
barks
at
his
reflexion
in
the
mirror
for
beasts
have
of
perception
which
resemble
reasoning
and
which
occur
also
in
the
inner
sense
of
men
when
their
actions
have
only
an
empirical
quality
but
beasts
do
nothing
which
compels
us
to
believe
that
they
have
what
deserves
to
be
properly
called
a
sense
as
i
have
shown
elsewhere
now
when
the
understanding
uses
and
follows
the
false
decision
of
the
inner
sense
as
when
the
famous
galileo
thought
that
saturn
had
two
handles
it
is
deceived
by
the
judgement
it
makes
upon
the
effect
of
appearances
and
it
infers
from
them
more
than
they
imply
for
the
appearances
of
the
senses
do
not
promise
us
absolutely
the
truth
of
things
any
more
than
dreams
do
it
is
we
who
deceive
ourselves
by
the
use
we
make
of
them
that
is
by
our
consecutions
indeed
we
allow
ourselves
to
be
deluded
by
probable
arguments
and
we
are
inclined
to
think
that
phenomena
such
as
we
have
found
linked
together
often
are
so
always
thus
as
it
happens
usually
that
that
which
appears
without
angles
has
none
we
readily
believe
it
to
be
always
thus
such
an
error
is
pardonable
and
sometimes
inevitable
when
it
is
necessary
to
act
promptly
and
choose
that
which
appearances
recommend
but
when
we
have
the
leisure
and
the
time
to
collect
our
thoughts
we
are
in
fault
if
we
take
for
certain
that
which
is
not
so
it
is
therefore
true
that
appearances
are
often
contrary
to
truth
but
our
reasoning
never
is
when
it
proceeds
strictly
in
accordance
with
the
rules
of
the
art
of
reasoning
if
by
one
meant
generally
the
faculty
of
reasoning
whether
well
or
ill
i
confess
that
it
might
deceive
us
and
does
indeed
deceive
us
and
the
appearances
of
our
understanding
are
often
as
deceptive
as
those
of
the
senses
but
here
it
is
a
question
of
the
linking
together
of
truths
and
of
objections
in
due
form
and
in
this
sense
it
is
impossible
for
reason
to
deceive
us
thus
it
may
be
seen
from
all
i
have
just
said
that
bayle
carries
too
far
being
above
as
if
it
included
the
insoluble
nature
of
objections
for
according
to
him
to
the
questions
of
a
vol
iii
ch
a
dogma
is
above
reason
philosophy
can
neither
explain
it
nor
comprehend
it
nor
meet
the
difficulties
that
are
urged
against
it
i
agree
with
regard
to
comprehension
but
i
have
already
shown
that
the
mysteries
receive
a
necessary
verbal
explanation
to
the
end
that
the
terms
employed
be
not
mente
words
signifying
nothing
i
have
shown
also
that
it
is
necessary
for
one
to
be
capable
of
answering
the
objections
and
that
otherwise
one
must
needs
reject
the
thesis
he
adduces
the
authority
of
theologians
who
appear
to
recognize
the
insoluble
nature
of
the
objections
against
the
mysteries
luther
is
one
of
the
chief
of
these
but
i
have
already
replied
in
to
the
passage
where
he
seems
to
say
that
philosophy
contradicts
theology
there
is
another
passage
servo
ch
where
he
says
that
the
apparent
injustice
of
god
is
proved
by
arguments
taken
from
the
adversity
of
good
people
and
the
prosperity
of
the
wicked
an
argument
irresistible
both
for
all
reason
and
for
natural
intelligence
talibus
traducta
quibus
nulla
ratio
aut
lumen
naturae
potest
resistere
but
soon
afterwards
he
shows
that
he
means
it
only
of
those
who
know
nothing
of
the
life
to
come
since
he
adds
that
an
expression
in
the
gospel
dissipates
this
difficulty
teaching
us
that
there
is
another
life
where
that
which
has
not
been
punished
and
rewarded
in
this
life
shall
receive
its
due
the
objection
is
then
far
from
being
insuperable
and
even
without
the
aid
of
the
gospel
one
could
bethink
oneself
of
this
answer
there
is
also
quoted
vol
iii
a
passage
from
martin
chemnitz
criticized
by
vedelius
and
defended
by
johann
musaeus
where
this
famous
theologian
seems
to
say
clearly
that
there
are
truths
in
the
word
of
god
which
are
not
only
above
reason
but
also
against
reason
but
this
passage
must
be
taken
as
referring
only
to
the
principles
of
reason
that
are
in
accordance
with
the
order
of
nature
as
musaeus
also
interprets
it
it
is
true
nevertheless
that
bayle
finds
some
authorities
who
are
more
favourable
to
him
descartes
being
one
of
the
chief
this
great
man
says
positively
part
i
of
his
art
we
shall
have
not
the
slightest
trouble
in
ridding
ourselves
of
the
difficulty
which
one
may
have
in
harmonizing
the
freedom
of
our
will
with
the
order
of
the
eternal
providence
of
god
we
observe
that
our
thought
is
finite
and
that
the
knowledge
and
the
omnipotence
of
god
whereby
he
has
not
only
known
from
all
eternity
all
that
which
is
or
which
can
be
but
also
has
willed
it
is
infinite
we
have
therefore
quite
enough
intelligence
to
recognize
clearly
and
distinctly
that
this
knowledge
and
this
power
are
in
god
but
we
have
not
enough
so
to
comprehend
their
scope
that
we
can
know
how
they
leave
the
actions
of
men
entirely
free
and
undetermined
yet
the
power
and
the
knowledge
of
god
must
not
prevent
us
from
believing
that
we
have
a
free
will
for
we
should
be
wrong
to
doubt
of
that
whereof
we
are
inwardly
conscious
and
which
we
know
by
experience
to
be
within
us
simply
because
we
do
not
comprehend
some
other
thing
which
we
know
to
be
incomprehensible
in
its
nature
this
passage
from
descartes
followed
by
his
adherents
who
rarely
think
of
doubting
what
he
asserts
has
always
appeared
strange
to
me
not
content
with
saying
that
as
for
him
he
sees
no
way
of
reconciling
the
two
dogmas
he
puts
the
whole
human
race
and
even
all
rational
creatures
in
the
same
case
yet
could
he
have
been
unaware
that
there
is
no
possibility
of
an
insuperable
objection
against
truth
for
such
an
objection
could
only
be
a
necessary
linking
together
of
other
truths
whose
result
would
be
contrary
to
the
truth
that
one
maintains
and
consequently
there
would
be
contradiction
between
the
truths
which
would
be
an
utter
absurdity
moreover
albeit
our
mind
is
finite
and
can
not
comprehend
the
infinite
of
the
infinite
nevertheless
it
has
proofs
whose
strength
or
weakness
it
comprehends
why
then
should
it
not
have
the
same
comprehension
in
regard
to
the
objections
and
since
the
power
and
the
wisdom
of
god
are
infinite
and
comprehend
everything
there
is
no
pretext
for
doubting
their
scope
further
descartes
demands
a
freedom
which
is
not
needed
by
his
insistence
that
the
actions
of
the
will
of
man
are
altogether
undetermined
a
thing
which
never
happens
finally
bayle
himself
maintains
that
this
experience
or
this
inward
sense
of
our
independence
upon
which
descartes
founds
the
proof
of
our
freedom
does
not
prove
it
for
from
the
fact
that
we
are
not
conscious
of
the
causes
whereon
we
depend
it
does
not
follow
according
to
bayle
that
we
are
independent
but
that
is
something
we
will
speak
of
in
its
proper
place
it
seems
that
descartes
confesses
also
in
a
passage
of
his
that
it
is
impossible
to
find
an
answer
to
the
difficulties
on
the
division
of
matter
to
infinity
which
he
nevertheless
recognizes
as
actual
arriaga
and
other
schoolmen
make
the
same
confession
but
if
they
took
the
trouble
to
give
to
the
objections
the
form
these
ought
to
have
they
would
see
that
there
are
faults
in
the
reasoning
and
sometimes
false
assumptions
which
cause
confusion
here
is
an
example
a
man
of
parts
one
day
brought
up
to
me
an
objection
in
the
following
form
let
the
straight
line
ba
be
cut
in
two
equal
parts
at
the
point
c
and
the
part
ca
at
the
point
d
and
the
part
da
at
the
point
e
and
so
on
to
infinity
all
the
halves
bc
cd
de
together
make
the
whole
ba
therefore
there
must
be
a
last
half
since
the
straight
line
ba
finishes
at
a
but
this
last
half
is
absurd
for
since
it
is
a
line
it
will
be
possible
again
to
cut
it
in
two
therefore
division
to
infinity
can
not
be
admitted
but
i
pointed
out
to
him
that
one
is
not
justified
in
the
inference
that
there
must
be
a
last
half
although
there
be
a
last
point
a
for
this
last
point
belongs
to
all
the
halves
of
its
side
and
my
friend
acknowledged
it
himself
when
he
endeavoured
to
prove
this
deduction
by
a
formal
argument
on
the
contrary
just
because
the
division
goes
on
to
infinity
there
is
no
last
half
and
although
the
straight
line
ab
be
finite
it
does
not
follow
that
the
process
of
dividing
it
has
any
final
end
the
same
confusion
arises
with
the
series
of
numbers
going
on
to
infinity
one
imagines
a
final
end
a
number
that
is
infinite
or
infinitely
small
but
that
is
all
simple
fiction
every
number
is
finite
and
specific
every
line
is
so
likewise
and
the
infinite
or
infinitely
small
signify
only
magnitudes
that
one
may
take
as
great
or
as
small
as
one
wishes
to
show
that
an
error
is
smaller
than
that
which
has
been
specified
that
is
to
say
that
there
is
no
error
or
else
by
the
infinitely
small
is
meant
the
state
of
a
magnitude
at
its
vanishing
point
or
its
beginning
conceived
after
the
pattern
of
magnitudes
already
actualized
it
will
however
be
well
to
consider
the
argument
that
bayle
puts
forward
to
show
that
one
can
not
refute
the
objections
which
reason
opposes
to
the
mysteries
it
is
in
his
comment
on
the
manichaeans
of
the
second
edition
of
his
is
enough
for
me
he
says
it
be
unanimously
acknowledged
that
the
mysteries
of
the
gospel
are
above
reason
for
thence
comes
the
necessary
conclusion
that
it
is
impossible
to
settle
the
difficulties
raised
by
the
philosophers
and
in
consequence
that
a
dispute
where
only
the
light
of
nature
is
followed
will
always
end
unfavourably
for
the
theologians
and
that
they
will
see
themselves
forced
to
give
way
and
to
take
refuge
in
the
canon
of
the
supernatural
light
i
am
surprised
that
bayle
speaks
in
such
general
terms
since
he
has
acknowledged
himself
that
the
light
of
nature
is
against
the
manichaeans
and
for
the
oneness
of
the
principle
and
that
the
goodness
of
god
is
proved
incontrovertibly
by
reason
yet
this
is
how
he
continues
is
evident
that
reason
can
never
attain
to
that
which
is
above
it
now
if
it
could
supply
answers
to
the
objections
which
are
opposed
to
the
dogma
of
the
trinity
and
that
of
hypostatic
union
it
would
attain
to
those
two
mysteries
it
would
have
them
in
subjection
and
submit
them
to
the
strictest
examination
by
comparison
with
its
first
principles
or
with
the
aphorisms
that
spring
from
common
notions
and
proceed
until
finally
it
had
drawn
the
conclusion
that
they
are
in
accordance
with
natural
light
it
would
therefore
do
what
exceeds
its
powers
it
would
soar
above
its
confines
and
that
is
a
formal
contradiction
one
must
therefore
say
that
it
can
not
provide
answers
to
its
own
objections
and
that
thus
they
remain
victorious
so
long
as
one
does
not
have
recourse
to
the
authority
of
god
and
to
the
necessity
of
subjugating
one
understanding
to
the
obedience
of
faith
i
do
not
find
that
there
is
any
force
in
this
reasoning
we
can
attain
to
that
which
is
above
us
not
by
penetrating
it
but
by
maintaining
it
as
we
can
attain
to
the
sky
by
sight
and
not
by
touch
nor
is
it
necessary
that
in
order
to
answer
the
objections
which
are
made
against
the
mysteries
one
should
have
them
in
subjection
to
oneself
and
submit
them
to
examination
by
comparison
with
the
first
principles
that
spring
from
common
notions
for
if
he
who
answers
the
objections
had
to
go
so
far
he
who
proposes
the
objections
needs
must
do
it
first
it
is
the
part
of
the
objection
to
open
up
the
subject
and
it
is
enough
for
him
who
answers
to
say
yes
or
no
he
is
not
obliged
to
counter
with
a
distinction
it
will
do
in
case
of
need
if
he
denies
the
universality
of
some
proposition
in
the
objection
or
criticizes
its
form
and
one
may
do
both
these
things
without
penetrating
beyond
the
objection
when
someone
offers
me
a
proof
which
he
maintains
is
invincible
i
can
keep
silence
while
i
compel
him
merely
to
prove
in
due
form
all
the
enunciations
that
he
brings
forward
and
such
as
appear
to
me
in
the
slightest
degree
doubtful
for
the
purpose
of
doubting
only
i
need
not
at
all
probe
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
on
the
contrary
the
more
ignorant
i
am
the
more
shall
i
be
justified
in
doubting
bayle
continues
thus
us
endeavour
to
clarify
that
if
some
doctrines
are
above
reason
they
are
beyond
its
reach
it
can
not
attain
to
them
if
it
can
not
attain
to
them
it
can
not
comprehend
them
he
could
have
begun
here
with
the
saying
that
reason
can
not
comprehend
that
which
is
above
it
it
can
not
comprehend
them
it
can
find
in
them
no
idea
valet
for
to
something
it
is
not
enough
that
one
have
some
ideas
thereof
one
must
have
all
the
ideas
of
everything
that
goes
to
make
it
up
and
all
these
ideas
must
be
clear
distinct
there
are
a
thousand
objects
in
nature
in
which
we
understand
something
but
which
we
do
not
therefore
necessarily
comprehend
we
have
some
ideas
on
the
rays
of
light
we
demonstrate
upon
them
up
to
a
certain
point
but
there
ever
remains
something
which
makes
us
confess
that
we
do
not
yet
comprehend
the
whole
nature
of
light
any
principle
such
as
may
give
rise
to
a
solution
why
should
not
evident
principles
be
found
mingled
with
obscure
and
confused
knowledge
consequently
the
objections
that
reason
has
made
will
remain
unanswered
by
no
means
the
difficulty
is
rather
on
the
side
of
the
opposer
it
is
for
him
to
seek
an
evident
principle
such
as
may
give
rise
to
some
objection
and
the
more
obscure
the
subject
the
more
trouble
he
will
have
in
finding
such
a
principle
moreover
when
he
has
found
it
he
will
have
still
more
trouble
in
demonstrating
an
opposition
between
the
principle
and
the
mystery
for
if
it
happened
that
the
mystery
was
evidently
contrary
to
an
evident
principle
it
would
not
be
an
obscure
mystery
it
would
be
a
manifest
absurdity
what
is
the
same
thing
answer
will
be
made
with
some
distinction
as
obscure
as
the
very
thesis
that
will
have
been
attacked
one
can
do
without
distinctions
if
need
be
by
denying
either
some
premiss
or
some
conclusion
and
when
one
is
doubtful
of
the
meaning
of
some
term
used
by
the
opposer
one
may
demand
of
him
its
definition
thus
the
defender
has
no
need
to
incommode
himself
when
it
is
a
question
of
answering
an
adversary
who
claims
that
he
is
offering
us
an
invincible
proof
but
even
supposing
that
the
defender
perchance
being
kindly
disposed
or
for
the
sake
of
brevity
or
because
he
feels
himself
strong
enough
should
himself
vouchsafe
to
show
the
ambiguity
concealed
in
the
objection
and
to
remove
it
by
making
some
distinction
this
distinction
need
not
of
necessity
lead
to
anything
clearer
than
the
first
thesis
since
the
defender
is
not
obliged
to
elucidate
the
mystery
itself
it
is
certain
so
bayle
continues
an
objection
which
is
founded
on
distinct
notions
remains
equally
victorious
whether
you
give
to
it
no
answer
or
you
make
an
answer
where
none
can
comprehend
anything
can
the
contest
be
equal
between
a
man
who
alleges
in
objection
to
you
that
which
you
and
he
very
clearly
conceive
and
you
who
can
only
defend
yourself
by
answers
wherein
neither
of
you
understands
anything
it
is
not
enough
that
the
objection
be
founded
on
quite
distinct
notions
it
is
necessary
also
that
one
apply
it
in
contradiction
of
the
thesis
and
when
i
answer
someone
by
denying
some
premiss
in
order
to
compel
him
to
prove
it
or
some
conclusion
to
compel
him
to
put
it
in
good
form
it
can
not
be
said
that
i
answer
nothing
or
that
i
answer
nothing
intelligible
for
as
it
is
the
doubtful
premiss
of
the
adversary
that
i
deny
my
denial
will
be
as
intelligible
as
his
affirmation
finally
when
i
am
so
obliging
as
to
explain
myself
by
means
of
some
distinction
it
suffices
that
the
terms
i
employ
have
some
meaning
as
in
the
mystery
itself
thus
something
in
my
answer
will
be
comprehended
but
one
need
not
of
necessity
comprehend
all
that
it
involves
otherwise
one
would
comprehend
the
mystery
also
bayle
continues
thus
philosophical
dispute
assumes
that
the
disputant
parties
agree
on
certain
definitions
this
would
be
desirable
but
usually
it
is
only
in
the
dispute
itself
that
one
reaches
such
a
point
if
the
necessity
arises
that
they
admit
the
rules
of
syllogisms
and
the
signs
for
the
recognition
of
bad
arguments
after
that
everything
lies
in
the
investigation
as
to
whether
a
thesis
conforms
mediately
or
immediately
to
the
principles
one
is
agreed
upon
which
is
done
by
means
of
the
syllogisms
of
him
who
makes
objections
the
premisses
of
a
proof
advanced
by
the
opposer
true
whether
the
conclusion
is
properly
drawn
whether
a
syllogism
has
been
employed
whether
some
aphorism
of
the
chapter
or
sophisticis
has
not
been
violated
it
is
enough
putting
it
briefly
to
deny
some
premiss
or
some
conclusion
or
finally
to
explain
or
get
explained
some
ambiguous
term
comes
off
victorious
either
by
showing
that
the
subject
of
dispute
has
no
connexion
with
the
principles
which
had
been
agreed
upon
that
is
to
say
by
showing
that
the
objection
proves
nothing
and
then
the
defender
wins
the
case
by
reducing
the
defender
to
absurdity
when
all
the
premisses
and
all
the
conclusions
are
well
proved
one
can
reduce
him
to
that
point
either
by
showing
him
that
the
conclusions
of
his
thesis
are
yes
and
no
at
once
or
by
constraining
him
to
say
only
intelligible
things
in
answer
this
last
embarrassment
he
can
always
avoid
because
he
has
no
need
to
advance
new
theses
aim
in
disputes
of
this
kind
is
to
throw
light
upon
obscurities
and
to
arrive
at
it
is
the
aim
of
the
opposer
for
he
wishes
to
demonstrate
that
the
mystery
is
false
but
this
can
not
here
be
the
aim
of
the
defender
for
in
admitting
mystery
he
agrees
that
one
can
not
demonstrate
it
leads
to
the
opinion
that
during
the
course
of
the
proceedings
victory
sides
more
or
less
with
the
defender
or
with
the
opposer
according
to
whether
there
is
more
or
less
clarity
in
the
propositions
of
the
one
than
in
the
propositions
of
the
other
that
is
speaking
as
if
the
defender
and
the
opposer
were
equally
unprotected
but
the
defender
is
like
a
besieged
commander
covered
by
his
defence
works
and
it
is
for
the
attacker
to
destroy
them
the
defender
has
no
need
here
of
and
he
seeks
it
not
but
it
is
for
the
opposer
to
find
it
against
him
and
to
break
through
with
his
batteries
in
order
that
the
defender
may
be
no
longer
protected
it
is
judged
that
victory
goes
against
him
whose
answers
are
such
that
one
comprehends
nothing
in
them
it
is
a
very
equivocal
sign
of
victory
for
then
one
must
needs
ask
the
audience
if
they
comprehend
anything
in
what
has
been
said
and
often
their
opinions
would
be
divided
the
order
of
formal
disputes
is
to
proceed
by
arguments
in
due
form
and
to
answer
them
by
denying
or
making
a
distinction
who
confesses
that
they
are
incomprehensible
it
is
permitted
to
him
who
maintains
the
truth
of
a
mystery
to
confess
that
this
mystery
is
incomprehensible
and
if
this
confession
were
sufficient
for
declaring
him
vanquished
there
would
be
no
need
of
objection
it
will
be
possible
for
a
truth
to
be
incomprehensible
but
never
so
far
as
to
justify
the
statement
that
one
comprehends
nothing
at
all
therein
it
would
be
in
that
case
what
the
ancient
schools
called
or
clem
that
is
words
devoid
of
meaning
is
condemned
thenceforth
by
the
rules
for
awarding
victory
and
even
when
he
can
not
be
pursued
in
the
mist
wherewith
he
has
covered
himself
and
which
forms
a
kind
of
abyss
between
him
and
his
antagonists
he
is
believed
to
be
utterly
defeated
and
is
compared
to
an
army
which
having
lost
the
battle
steals
away
from
the
pursuit
of
the
victor
only
under
cover
of
night
matching
allegory
with
allegory
i
will
say
that
the
defender
is
not
vanquished
so
long
as
he
remains
protected
by
his
entrenchments
and
if
he
risks
some
sortie
beyond
his
need
it
is
permitted
to
him
to
withdraw
within
his
fort
without
being
open
to
blame
for
that
i
was
especially
at
pains
to
analyse
this
long
passage
where
bayle
has
put
down
his
strongest
and
most
skilfully
reasoned
statements
in
support
of
his
opinion
and
i
hope
that
i
have
shown
clearly
how
this
excellent
man
has
been
misled
that
happens
all
too
easily
to
the
ablest
and
shrewdest
persons
when
they
give
free
rein
to
their
wit
without
exercising
the
patience
necessary
for
delving
down
to
the
very
foundations
of
their
systems
the
details
we
have
entered
into
here
will
serve
as
answer
to
some
other
arguments
upon
the
subject
which
are
dispersed
through
the
works
of
bayle
as
for
instance
when
he
says
in
his
to
the
questions
of
a
vol
iii
ch
prove
that
one
has
brought
reason
and
religion
into
harmony
one
must
show
not
only
that
one
has
philosophic
maxims
favourable
to
our
faith
but
also
that
the
particular
maxims
cast
up
against
us
as
not
being
consistent
with
our
catechism
are
in
reality
consistent
with
it
in
a
clearly
conceived
way
i
do
not
see
that
one
has
need
of
all
that
unless
one
aspire
to
press
reasoning
as
far
as
the
of
the
mystery
when
one
is
content
to
uphold
its
truth
without
attempting
to
render
it
comprehensible
one
has
no
need
to
resort
to
philosophic
maxims
general
or
particular
for
the
proof
and
when
another
brings
up
some
philosophic
maxims
against
us
it
is
not
for
us
to
prove
clearly
and
distinctly
that
these
maxims
are
consistent
with
our
dogma
but
it
is
for
our
opponent
to
prove
that
they
are
contrary
thereto
bayle
continues
thus
in
the
same
passage
this
result
we
need
an
answer
as
clearly
evident
as
the
objection
i
have
already
shown
that
it
is
obtained
when
one
denies
the
premisses
but
that
for
the
rest
it
is
not
necessary
for
him
who
maintains
the
truth
of
the
mystery
always
to
advance
evident
propositions
since
the
principal
thesis
concerning
the
mystery
itself
is
not
evident
he
adds
further
we
must
make
reply
and
rejoinder
we
must
never
rest
in
our
positions
nor
claim
that
we
have
accomplished
our
design
so
long
as
our
opponent
shall
make
answer
with
things
as
evident
as
our
reasons
can
be
but
it
is
not
for
the
defender
to
adduce
reasons
it
is
enough
for
him
to
answer
those
of
his
opponent
finally
the
author
draws
the
conclusion
it
were
claimed
that
on
making
an
evident
objection
a
man
has
to
be
satisfied
with
an
answer
which
we
can
only
state
as
a
thing
possible
though
incomprehensible
to
us
that
would
be
unfair
he
repeats
this
in
the
posthumous
dialogues
against
jacquelot
i
am
not
of
this
opinion
if
the
objection
were
completely
evident
it
would
triumph
and
the
thesis
would
be
overthrown
but
when
the
objection
is
only
founded
on
appearances
or
on
instances
of
the
most
frequent
occurrence
and
when
he
who
makes
it
desires
to
draw
from
it
a
universal
and
certain
conclusion
he
who
upholds
the
mystery
may
answer
with
the
instance
of
a
bare
possibility
for
such
an
instance
suffices
to
show
that
what
one
wished
to
infer
from
the
premisses
is
neither
certain
nor
general
and
it
suffices
for
him
who
upholds
the
mystery
to
maintain
that
it
is
possible
without
having
to
maintain
that
it
is
probable
for
as
i
have
often
said
it
is
agreed
that
the
mysteries
are
against
appearances
he
who
upholds
the
mystery
need
not
even
adduce
such
an
instance
and
should
he
adduce
it
it
were
indeed
a
work
of
supererogation
or
else
an
instrument
of
greater
confusion
to
the
adversary
there
are
passages
of
bayle
in
the
posthumous
reply
that
he
made
to
jacquelot
which
seem
to
me
still
worthy
of
scrutiny
according
to
pp
asserts
in
his
whenever
the
subject
allows
that
our
reason
is
more
capable
of
refuting
and
destroying
than
of
proving
and
building
that
there
is
scarcely
any
philosophical
or
theological
matter
in
respect
of
which
it
does
not
create
great
difficulties
thus
he
says
one
desired
to
follow
it
in
a
disputatious
spirit
as
far
as
it
can
go
one
would
often
be
reduced
to
a
state
of
troublesome
perplexity
and
in
fine
there
are
doctrines
certainly
true
which
it
disputes
with
insoluble
objections
i
think
that
what
is
said
here
in
reproach
of
reason
is
to
its
advantage
when
it
overthrows
some
thesis
it
builds
up
the
opposing
thesis
and
when
it
seems
to
be
overthrowing
the
two
opposing
theses
at
the
same
time
it
is
then
that
it
promises
us
something
profound
provided
that
we
follow
it
far
as
it
can
not
in
a
disputatious
spirit
but
with
an
ardent
desire
to
search
out
and
discover
the
truth
which
will
always
be
recompensed
with
a
great
measure
of
success
bayle
continues
one
must
then
ridicule
these
objections
recognizing
the
narrow
bounds
of
the
human
mind
and
i
think
on
the
other
hand
that
one
must
recognize
the
signs
of
the
force
of
the
human
mind
which
causes
it
to
penetrate
into
the
heart
of
things
these
are
new
openings
and
as
it
were
rays
of
the
dawn
which
promises
us
a
greater
light
i
mean
in
philosophical
subjects
or
those
of
natural
theology
but
when
these
objections
are
made
against
revealed
faith
it
is
enough
that
one
be
able
to
repel
them
provided
that
one
do
so
in
a
submissive
and
zealous
spirit
with
intent
to
sustain
and
exalt
the
glory
of
god
and
when
we
succeed
in
respect
of
his
justice
we
shall
likewise
be
impressed
by
his
greatness
and
charmed
by
his
goodness
which
will
show
themselves
through
the
clouds
of
a
seeming
reason
that
is
deceived
by
outward
appearances
in
proportion
as
the
mind
is
elevated
by
true
reason
to
that
which
to
us
is
invisible
but
none
the
less
sure
to
continue
with
bayle
will
be
compelled
to
lay
down
its
arms
and
to
subjugate
itself
to
the
obedience
of
the
faith
which
it
can
and
ought
to
do
in
virtue
of
some
of
its
most
incontestable
maxims
thus
also
in
renouncing
some
of
its
other
maxims
it
acts
nevertheless
in
accordance
with
that
which
it
is
that
is
to
say
in
reason
but
one
must
know
such
maxims
of
reason
as
must
be
renounced
in
this
case
are
only
those
which
make
us
judge
by
appearances
or
according
to
the
ordinary
course
of
things
this
reason
enjoins
upon
us
even
in
philosophical
subjects
when
there
are
invincible
proofs
to
the
contrary
it
is
thus
that
being
made
confident
by
demonstrations
of
the
goodness
and
the
justice
of
god
we
disregard
the
appearances
of
harshness
and
injustice
which
we
see
in
this
small
portion
of
his
kingdom
that
is
exposed
to
our
gaze
hitherto
we
have
been
illumined
by
the
of
and
by
that
of
but
not
yet
by
that
of
here
on
earth
we
see
apparent
injustice
and
we
believe
and
even
know
the
truth
of
the
hidden
justice
of
god
but
we
shall
see
that
justice
when
at
last
the
sun
of
justice
shall
show
himself
as
he
is
it
is
certain
that
bayle
can
only
be
understood
as
meaning
those
ostensible
maxims
which
must
give
way
before
the
eternal
verities
for
he
acknowledges
that
reason
is
not
in
reality
contrary
to
faith
in
these
posthumous
dialogues
he
complains
against
jacquelot
of
being
accused
of
the
belief
that
our
mysteries
are
in
reality
against
reason
and
against
le
clerc
of
the
assertion
made
that
he
who
acknowledges
that
a
doctrine
is
exposed
to
irrefutable
objections
acknowledges
also
by
a
necessary
consequence
the
falsity
of
this
doctrine
nevertheless
one
would
be
justified
in
the
assertion
if
the
irrefutability
were
more
than
an
outward
appearance
it
may
be
therefore
that
having
long
contended
thus
against
bayle
on
the
matter
of
the
use
of
reason
i
shall
find
after
all
that
his
opinions
were
not
fundamentally
so
remote
from
mine
as
his
expressions
which
have
provided
matter
for
our
considerations
have
led
one
to
believe
it
is
true
that
frequently
he
appears
to
deny
absolutely
that
one
can
ever
answer
the
objections
of
reason
against
faith
and
that
he
asserts
the
necessity
of
comprehending
in
order
to
achieve
such
an
end
how
the
mystery
comes
to
be
or
exists
yet
there
are
passages
where
he
becomes
milder
and
contents
himself
with
saying
that
the
answers
to
these
objections
are
unknown
to
him
here
is
a
very
precise
passage
taken
from
the
excursus
on
the
manichaeans
which
is
found
at
the
end
of
the
second
edition
of
his
the
greater
satisfaction
of
the
most
punctilious
readers
i
desire
to
declare
here
he
says
wherever
the
statement
is
to
be
met
with
in
my
that
such
and
such
arguments
are
irrefutable
i
do
not
wish
it
to
be
taken
that
they
are
so
in
actuality
i
mean
naught
else
than
that
they
appear
to
me
irrefutable
that
is
of
no
consequence
each
one
will
be
able
to
imagine
if
he
pleases
that
if
i
deem
thus
of
a
matter
it
is
owing
to
my
lack
of
acumen
i
do
not
imagine
such
a
thing
his
great
acumen
is
too
well
known
to
me
but
i
think
that
after
having
applied
his
whole
mind
to
magnifying
the
objections
he
had
not
enough
attention
left
over
for
the
purpose
of
answering
them
bayle
confesses
moreover
in
his
posthumous
work
against
le
clerc
that
the
objections
against
faith
have
not
the
force
of
proofs
it
is
therefore
only
or
rather
that
is
in
relation
to
the
existing
state
of
the
human
race
that
he
deems
these
objections
irrefutable
and
the
subject
unexplainable
there
is
even
a
passage
where
he
implies
that
he
despairs
not
of
the
possibility
that
the
answer
or
the
explanation
may
be
found
and
even
in
our
time
for
here
is
what
he
says
in
his
posthumous
reply
to
le
clerc
bayle
dared
to
hope
that
his
toil
would
put
on
their
mettle
some
of
those
great
men
of
genius
who
create
new
systems
and
that
they
could
discover
a
solution
hitherto
unknown
it
seems
that
by
this
he
means
such
an
explanation
of
mystery
as
would
penetrate
to
the
but
that
is
not
necessary
for
replying
to
the
objections
many
have
undertaken
to
render
this
comprehensible
and
to
prove
the
possibility
of
mysteries
a
certain
writer
named
thomas
bonartes
nordtanus
anglus
in
his
scientiae
cum
fide
claimed
to
do
so
this
work
seemed
to
me
ingenious
and
learned
but
crabbed
and
involved
and
it
even
contains
indefensible
opinions
i
learned
from
the
of
the
dominican
father
vincent
baron
that

not

of

essays
on
the
justice
of
god
and
the
freedom
of
man
in
the
origin
of
evil
part
one
having
so
settled
the
rights
of
faith
and
of
reason
as
rather
to
place
reason
at
the
service
of
faith
than
in
opposition
to
it
we
shall
see
how
they
exercise
these
rights
to
support
and
harmonize
what
the
light
of
nature
and
the
light
of
revelation
teach
us
of
god
and
of
man
in
relation
to
evil
the
are
distinguishable
into
two
classes
the
one
kind
springs
from
man
freedom
which
appears
incompatible
with
the
divine
nature
and
nevertheless
freedom
is
deemed
necessary
in
order
that
man
may
be
deemed
guilty
and
open
to
punishment
the
other
kind
concerns
the
conduct
of
god
and
seems
to
make
him
participate
too
much
in
the
existence
of
evil
even
though
man
be
free
and
participate
also
therein
and
this
conduct
appears
contrary
to
the
goodness
the
holiness
and
the
justice
of
god
since
god
in
evil
as
well
physical
as
moral
and
in
each
of
them
both
morally
and
physically
and
since
it
seems
that
these
evils
are
manifested
in
the
order
of
nature
as
well
as
in
that
of
grace
and
in
the
future
and
eternal
life
as
well
as
nay
more
than
in
this
transitory
life
to
present
these
difficulties
in
brief
it
must
be
observed
that
freedom
is
opposed
to
all
appearance
by
determination
or
certainty
of
any
kind
whatever
and
nevertheless
the
common
dogma
of
our
philosophers
states
that
the
truth
of
contingent
futurities
is
determined
the
foreknowledge
of
god
renders
all
the
future
certain
and
determined
but
his
providence
and
his
foreordinance
whereon
foreknowledge
itself
appears
founded
do
much
more
for
god
is
not
as
a
man
able
to
look
upon
events
with
unconcern
and
to
suspend
his
judgement
since
nothing
exists
save
as
a
result
of
the
decrees
of
his
will
and
through
the
action
of
his
power
and
even
though
one
leave
out
of
account
the
of
god
all
is
perfectly
connected
in
the
order
of
things
since
nothing
can
come
to
pass
unless
there
be
a
cause
so
disposed
as
to
produce
the
effect
this
taking
place
no
less
in
voluntary
than
in
all
other
actions
according
to
which
it
appears
that
man
is
compelled
to
do
the
good
and
evil
that
he
does
and
in
consequence
that
he
deserves
therefor
neither
recompense
nor
chastisement
thus
is
the
morality
of
actions
destroyed
and
all
justice
divine
and
human
shaken
but
even
though
one
should
grant
to
man
this
freedom
wherewith
he
arrays
himself
to
his
own
hurt
the
conduct
of
god
could
not
but
provide
matter
for
a
criticism
supported
by
the
presumptuous
ignorance
of
men
who
would
wish
to
exculpate
themselves
wholly
or
in
part
at
the
expense
of
god
it
is
objected
that
all
the
reality
and
what
is
termed
the
substance
of
the
act
in
sin
itself
is
a
production
of
god
since
all
creatures
and
all
their
actions
derive
from
him
that
reality
they
have
whence
one
could
infer
not
only
that
he
is
the
physical
cause
of
sin
but
also
that
he
is
its
moral
cause
since
he
acts
with
perfect
freedom
and
does
nothing
without
a
complete
knowledge
of
the
thing
and
the
consequences
that
it
may
have
nor
is
it
enough
to
say
that
god
has
made
for
himself
a
law
to
with
the
wills
or
resolutions
of
man
whether
we
express
ourselves
in
terms
of
the
common
opinion
or
in
terms
of
the
system
of
occasional
causes
not
only
will
it
be
found
strange
that
he
should
have
made
such
a
law
for
himself
of
whose
results
he
was
not
ignorant
but
the
principal
difficulty
is
that
it
seems
the
evil
will
itself
can
not
exist
without
and
even
without
some
predetermination
on
his
part
which
contributes
towards
begetting
this
will
in
man
or
in
some
other
rational
creature
for
an
action
is
not
for
being
evil
the
less
dependent
on
god
whence
one
will
come
at
last
to
the
conclusion
that
god
does
all
the
good
and
the
evil
indifferently
unless
one
pretend
with
the
manichaeans
that
there
are
two
principles
the
one
good
and
the
other
evil
moreover
according
to
the
general
opinion
of
theologians
and
philosophers
conservation
being
a
perpetual
creation
it
will
be
said
that
man
is
perpetually
created
corrupt
and
erring
there
are
furthermore
modern
cartesians
who
claim
that
god
is
the
sole
agent
of
whom
created
beings
are
only
the
purely
passive
organs
and
bayle
builds
not
a
little
upon
that
idea
but
even
granting
that
god
should
in
actions
only
with
a
general
or
even
not
at
all
at
least
in
those
that
are
bad
it
suffices
so
it
is
said
to
inculpate
him
and
to
render
him
the
moral
cause
that
nothing
comes
to
pass
without
his
permission
to
say
nothing
of
the
fall
of
the
angels
he
knows
all
that
which
will
come
to
pass
if
having
created
man
he
places
him
in
such
and
such
circumstances
and
he
places
him
there
notwithstanding
man
is
exposed
to
a
temptation
to
which
it
is
known
that
he
will
succumb
thereby
causing
an
infinitude
of
frightful
evils
by
which
the
whole
human
race
will
be
infected
and
brought
as
it
were
into
a
necessity
of
sinning
a
state
which
is
named
sin
thus
the
world
will
be
brought
into
a
strange
confusion
by
this
means
death
and
diseases
being
introduced
with
a
thousand
other
misfortunes
and
miseries
that
in
general
afflict
the
good
and
the
bad
wickedness
will
even
hold
sway
and
virtue
will
be
oppressed
on
earth
so
that
it
will
scarce
appear
that
a
providence
governs
affairs
but
it
is
much
worse
when
one
considers
the
life
to
come
since
but
a
small
number
of
men
will
be
saved
and
since
all
the
rest
will
perish
eternally
furthermore
these
men
destined
for
salvation
will
have
been
withdrawn
from
the
corrupt
mass
through
an
unreasoning
election
whether
it
be
said
that
god
in
choosing
them
has
had
regard
to
their
future
actions
to
their
faith
or
to
their
works
or
one
claim
that
he
has
been
pleased
to
give
them
these
good
qualities
and
these
actions
because
he
has
predestined
them
to
salvation
for
though
it
be
said
in
the
most
lenient
system
that
god
wished
to
save
all
men
and
though
in
the
other
systems
commonly
accepted
it
be
granted
that
he
has
made
his
son
take
human
nature
upon
him
to
expiate
their
sins
so
that
all
they
who
shall
believe
in
him
with
a
lively
and
final
faith
shall
be
saved
it
still
remains
true
that
this
lively
faith
is
a
gift
of
god
that
we
are
dead
to
all
good
works
that
even
our
will
itself
must
be
aroused
by
a
prevenient
grace
and
that
god
gives
us
the
power
to
will
and
to
do
and
whether
that
be
done
through
a
grace
efficacious
of
itself
that
is
to
say
through
a
divine
inward
motion
which
wholly
determines
our
will
to
the
good
that
it
does
or
whether
there
be
only
a
sufficient
grace
but
such
as
does
not
fail
to
attain
its
end
and
to
become
efficacious
in
the
inward
and
outward
circumstances
wherein
the
man
is
and
has
been
placed
by
god
one
must
return
to
the
same
conclusion
that
god
is
the
final
reason
of
salvation
of
grace
of
faith
and
of
election
in
jesus
christ
and
be
the
election
the
cause
or
the
result
of
god
design
to
give
faith
it
still
remains
true
that
he
gives
faith
or
salvation
to
whom
he
pleases
without
any
discernible
reason
for
his
choice
which
falls
upon
but
few
men
so
it
is
a
terrible
judgement
that
god
giving
his
only
son
for
the
whole
human
race
and
being
the
sole
author
and
master
of
the
salvation
of
men
yet
saves
so
few
of
them
and
abandons
all
others
to
the
devil
his
enemy
who
torments
them
eternally
and
makes
them
curse
their
creator
though
they
have
all
been
created
to
diffuse
and
show
forth
his
goodness
his
justice
and
his
other
perfections
and
this
outcome
inspires
all
the
more
horror
as
the
sole
cause
why
all
these
men
are
wretched
to
all
eternity
is
god
having
exposed
their
parents
to
a
temptation
that
he
knew
they
would
not
resist
as
this
sin
is
inherent
and
imputed
to
men
before
their
will
has
participated
in
it
as
this
hereditary
vice
impels
their
will
to
commit
actual
sins
and
as
countless
men
in
childhood
or
maturity
that
have
never
heard
or
have
not
heard
enough
of
jesus
christ
saviour
of
the
human
race
die
before
receiving
the
necessary
succour
for
their
withdrawal
from
this
abyss
of
sin
these
men
too
are
condemned
to
be
for
ever
rebellious
against
god
and
plunged
in
the
most
horrible
miseries
with
the
wickedest
of
all
creatures
though
in
essence
they
have
not
been
more
wicked
than
others
and
several
among
them
have
perchance
been
less
guilty
than
some
of
that
little
number
of
elect
who
were
saved
by
a
grace
without
reason
and
who
thereby
enjoy
an
eternal
felicity
which
they
had
not
deserved
such
in
brief
are
the
difficulties
touched
upon
by
sundry
persons
but
bayle
was
one
who
insisted
on
them
the
most
as
will
appear
subsequently
when
we
examine
his
passages
i
think
that
now
i
have
recorded
the
main
essence
of
these
difficulties
but
i
have
deemed
it
fitting
to
refrain
from
some
expressions
and
exaggerations
which
might
have
caused
offence
while
not
rendering
the
objections
any
stronger
let
us
now
turn
the
medal
and
let
us
also
point
out
what
can
be
said
in
answer
to
those
objections
and
here
a
course
of
explanation
through
fuller
dissertation
will
be
necessary
for
many
difficulties
can
be
opened
up
in
few
words
but
for
their
discussion
one
must
dilate
upon
them
our
end
is
to
banish
from
men
the
false
ideas
that
represent
god
to
them
as
an
absolute
prince
employing
a
despotic
power
unfitted
to
be
loved
and
unworthy
of
being
loved
these
notions
are
the
more
evil
in
relation
to
god
inasmuch
as
the
essence
of
piety
is
not
only
to
fear
him
but
also
to
love
him
above
all
things
and
that
can
not
come
about
unless
there
be
knowledge
of
his
perfections
capable
of
arousing
the
love
which
he
deserves
and
which
makes
the
felicity
of
those
that
love
him
feeling
ourselves
animated
by
a
zeal
such
as
can
not
fail
to
please
him
we
have
cause
to
hope
that
he
will
enlighten
us
and
that
he
will
himself
aid
us
in
the
execution
of
a
project
undertaken
for
his
glory
and
for
the
good
of
men
a
cause
so
good
gives
confidence
if
there
are
plausible
appearances
against
us
there
are
proofs
on
our
side
and
i
would
dare
to
say
to
an
adversary
quam
mage
sit
nostrum
penetrabile
is
the
first
reason
of
for
such
things
as
are
bounded
as
all
that
which
we
see
and
experience
are
contingent
and
have
nothing
in
them
to
render
their
existence
necessary
it
being
plain
that
time
space
and
matter
united
and
uniform
in
themselves
and
indifferent
to
everything
might
have
received
entirely
other
motions
and
shapes
and
in
another
order
therefore
one
must
seek
the
reason
for
the
existence
of
the
world
which
is
the
whole
assemblage
of
things
and
seek
it
in
the
substance
which
carries
with
it
the
reason
for
its
existence
and
which
in
consequence
is
and
eternal
moreover
this
cause
must
be
intelligent
for
this
existing
world
being
contingent
and
an
infinity
of
other
worlds
being
equally
possible
and
holding
so
to
say
equal
claim
to
existence
with
it
the
cause
of
the
world
must
needs
have
had
regard
or
reference
to
all
these
possible
worlds
in
order
to
fix
upon
one
of
them
this
regard
or
relation
of
an
existent
substance
to
simple
possibilities
can
be
nothing
other
than
the
which
has
the
ideas
of
them
while
to
fix
upon
one
of
them
can
be
nothing
other
than
the
act
of
the
which
chooses
it
is
the
of
this
substance
that
renders
its
will
efficacious
power
relates
to
wisdom
or
understanding
to
and
will
to
and
this
intelligent
cause
ought
to
be
infinite
in
all
ways
and
absolutely
perfect
in
in
and
in
since
it
relates
to
all
that
which
is
possible
furthermore
since
all
is
connected
together
there
is
no
ground
for
admitting
more
than
its
understanding
is
the
source
of
and
its
will
is
the
origin
of
there
in
few
words
is
the
proof
of
one
only
god
with
his
perfections
and
through
him
of
the
origin
of
things
now
this
supreme
wisdom
united
to
a
goodness
that
is
no
less
infinite
can
not
but
have
chosen
the
best
for
as
a
lesser
evil
is
a
kind
of
good
even
so
a
lesser
good
is
a
kind
of
evil
if
it
stands
in
the
way
of
a
greater
good
and
there
would
be
something
to
correct
in
the
actions
of
god
if
it
were
possible
to
do
better
as
in
mathematics
when
there
is
no
maximum
nor
minimum
in
short
nothing
distinguished
everything
is
done
equally
or
when
that
is
not
possible
nothing
at
all
is
done
so
it
may
be
said
likewise
in
respect
of
perfect
wisdom
which
is
no
less
orderly
than
mathematics
that
if
there
were
not
the
best
among
all
possible
worlds
god
would
not
have
produced
any
i
call
the
whole
succession
and
the
whole
agglomeration
of
all
existent
things
lest
it
be
said
that
several
worlds
could
have
existed
in
different
times
and
different
places
for
they
must
needs
be
reckoned
all
together
as
one
world
or
if
you
will
as
one
universe
and
even
though
one
should
fill
all
times
and
all
places
it
still
remains
true
that
one
might
have
filled
them
in
innumerable
ways
and
that
there
is
an
infinitude
of
possible
worlds
among
which
god
must
needs
have
chosen
the
best
since
he
does
nothing
without
acting
in
accordance
with
supreme
reason
some
adversary
not
being
able
to
answer
this
argument
will
perchance
answer
the
conclusion
by
a
saying
that
the
world
could
have
been
without
sin
and
without
sufferings
but
i
deny
that
then
it
would
have
been
for
it
must
be
known
that
all
things
are
in
each
one
of
the
possible
worlds
the
universe
whatever
it
may
be
is
all
of
one
piece
like
an
ocean
the
least
movement
extends
its
effect
there
to
any
distance
whatsoever
even
though
this
effect
become
less
perceptible
in
proportion
to
the
distance
therein
god
has
ordered
all
things
beforehand
once
for
all
having
foreseen
prayers
good
and
bad
actions
and
all
the
rest
and
each
thing
an
has
contributed
before
its
existence
to
the
resolution
that
has
been
made
upon
the
existence
of
all
things
so
that
nothing
can
be
changed
in
the
universe
any
more
than
in
a
number
save
its
essence
or
if
you
will
save
its
thus
if
the
smallest
evil
that
comes
to
pass
in
the
world
were
missing
in
it
it
would
no
longer
be
this
world
which
with
nothing
omitted
and
all
allowance
made
was
found
the
best
by
the
creator
who
chose
it
it
is
true
that
one
may
imagine
possible
worlds
without
sin
and
without
unhappiness
and
one
could
make
some
like
utopian
or
sevarambian
romances
but
these
same
worlds
again
would
be
very
inferior
to
ours
in
goodness
i
can
not
show
you
this
in
detail
for
can
i
know
and
can
i
present
infinities
to
you
and
compare
them
together
but
you
must
judge
with
me
since
god
has
chosen
this
world
as
it
is
we
know
moreover
that
often
an
evil
brings
forth
a
good
whereto
one
would
not
have
attained
without
that
evil
often
indeed
two
evils
have
made
one
great
good

even
so
two
liquids

the
illustrious
prelates
of
the
gallican
church
who
wrote
to
pope
innocent
xii
against
cardinal
sfondrati
book
on
predestination
being
of
the
principles
of
augustine
have
said
things
well
fitted
to
elucidate
this
great
point
the
cardinal
appears
to
prefer
even
to
the
kingdom
of
heaven
the
state
of
children
dying
without
baptism
because
sin
is
the
greatest
of
evils
and
they
have
died
innocent
of
all
actual
sin
more
will
be
said
of
that
below
the
prelates
have
observed
that
this
opinion
is
ill
founded
the
apostle
they
say
rom
iii
is
right
to
disapprove
of
the
doing
of
evil
that
good
may
come
but
one
can
not
disapprove
that
god
through
his
exceeding
power
derive
from
the
permitting
of
sins
greater
goods
than
such
as
occurred
before
the
sins
it
is
not
that
we
ought
to
take
pleasure
in
sin
god
forbid
but
that
we
believe
the
same
apostle
when
he
says
rom
that
where
sin
abounded
grace
did
much
more
abound
and
we
remember
that
we
have
gained
jesus
christ
himself
by
reason
of
sin
thus
we
see
that
the
opinion
of
these
prelates
tends
to
maintain
that
a
sequence
of
things
where
sin
enters
in
may
have
been
and
has
been
in
effect
better
than
another
sequence
without
sin
use
has
ever
been
made
of
comparisons
taken
from
the
pleasures
of
the
senses
when
these
are
mingled
with
that
which
borders
on
pain
to
prove
that
there
is
something
of
like
nature
in
intellectual
pleasures
a
little
acid
sharpness
or
bitterness
is
often
more
pleasing
than
sugar
shadows
enhance
colours
and
even
a
dissonance
in
the
right
place
gives
relief
to
harmony
we
wish
to
be
terrified
by
on
the
point
of
falling
and
we
wish
that
tragedies
shall
cause
us
to
weep
do
men
relish
health
enough
or
thank
god
enough
for
it
without
having
ever
been
sick
and
is
it
not
most
often
necessary
that
a
little
evil
render
the
good
more
discernible
that
is
to
say
greater
but
it
will
be
said
that
evils
are
great
and
many
in
number
in
comparison
with
the
good
that
is
erroneous
it
is
only
want
of
attention
that
diminishes
our
good
and
this
attention
must
be
given
to
us
through
some
admixture
of
evils
if
we
were
usually
sick
and
seldom
in
good
health
we
should
be
wonderfully
sensible
of
that
great
good
and
we
should
be
less
sensible
of
our
evils
but
is
it
not
better
notwithstanding
that
health
should
be
usual
and
sickness
the
exception
let
us
then
by
our
reflexion
supply
what
is
lacking
in
our
perception
in
order
to
make
the
good
of
health
more
discernible
had
we
not
the
knowledge
of
the
life
to
come
i
believe
there
would
be
few
persons
who
being
at
the
point
of
death
were
not
content
to
take
up
life
again
on
condition
of
passing
through
the
same
amount
of
good
and
evil
provided
always
that
it
were
not
the
same
kind
one
would
be
content
with
variety
without
requiring
a
better
condition
than
that
wherein
one
had
been
when
one
considers
also
the
fragility
of
the
human
body
one
looks
in
wonder
at
the
wisdom
and
the
goodness
of
the
author
of
nature
who
has
made
the
body
so
enduring
and
its
condition
so
tolerable
that
has
often
made
me
say
that
i
am
not
astonished
men
are
sometimes
sick
but
that
i
am
astonished
they
are
sick
so
little
and
not
always
this
also
ought
to
make
us
the
more
esteem
the
divine
contrivance
of
the
mechanism
of
animals
whose
author
has
made
machines
so
fragile
and
so
subject
to
corruption
and
yet
so
capable
of
maintaining
themselves
for
it
is
nature
which
cures
us
rather
than
medicine
now
this
very
fragility
is
a
consequence
of
the
nature
of
things
unless
we
are
to
will
that
this
kind
of
creature
reasoning
and
clothed
in
flesh
and
bones
be
not
in
the
world
but
that
to
all
appearance
would
be
a
defect
which
some
philosophers
of
old
would
have
called
a
gap
in
the
order
of
species
those
whose
humour
it
is
to
be
well
satisfied
with
nature
and
with
fortune
and
not
to
complain
about
them
even
though
they
should
not
be
the
best
endowed
appear
to
me
preferable
to
the
other
sort
for
besides
that
these
complaints
are
ill
founded
it
is
in
effect
murmuring
against
the
orders
of
providence
one
must
not
readily
be
among
the
malcontents
in
the
state
where
one
is
and
one
must
not
be
so
at
all
in
the
city
of
god
wherein
one
can
only
wrongfully
be
of
their
number
the
books
of
human
misery
such
as
that
of
pope
innocent
iii
to
me
seem
not
of
the
most
serviceable
evils
are
doubled
by
being
given
an
attention
that
ought
to
be
averted
from
them
to
be
turned
towards
the
good
which
by
far
preponderates
even
less
do
i
approve
books
such
as
that
of
abbé
esprit
the
falsity
of
human
of
which
we
have
lately
been
given
a
summary
for
such
a
book
serves
to
turn
everything
wrong
side
out
and
cause
men
to
be
such
as
it
represents
them
it
must
be
confessed
however
that
there
are
disorders
in
this
life
which
appear
especially
in
the
prosperity
of
sundry
evil
men
and
in
the
misfortune
of
many
good
people
there
is
a
german
proverb
which
even
grants
the
advantage
to
the
evil
ones
as
if
they
were
commonly
the
most
fortunate
krümmer
holz
je
bessre
krücke
ärger
schalck
je
grösser
and
it
were
to
be
desired
that
this
saying
of
horace
should
be
true
in
our
eyes
antecedentem
pede
poena
yet
it
often
comes
to
pass
also
though
this
perchance
not
the
most
often
in
the
world
eyes
heaven
is
justified
and
that
one
may
say
with
claudian
hunc
tandem
rufini
poena
tumultum
deos
but
even
though
that
should
not
happen
here
the
remedy
is
all
prepared
in
the
other
life
religion
and
reason
itself
teach
us
that
and
we
must
not
murmur
against
a
respite
which
the
supreme
wisdom
has
thought
fit
to
grant
to
men
for
repentance
yet
there
objections
multiply
on
another
side
when
one
considers
salvation
and
damnation
for
it
appears
strange
that
even
in
the
great
future
of
eternity
evil
should
have
the
advantage
over
good
under
the
supreme
authority
of
him
who
is
the
sovereign
good
since
there
will
be
many
that
are
called
and
few
that
are
chosen
or
are
saved
it
is
true
that
one
sees
from
some
lines
of
prudentius
hymn
ante
somnum
tamen
retundit
iram
non
perire
in
aevum
that
divers
men
believed
in
his
time
that
the
number
of
those
wicked
enough
to
be
damned
would
be
very
small
to
some
indeed
it
seems
that
men
believed
at
that
time
in
a
sphere
between
hell
and
paradise
that
this
same
prudentius
speaks
as
if
he
were
satisfied
with
this
sphere
that
gregory
of
nyssa
also
inclines
in
that
direction
and
that
jerome
leans
towards
the
opinion
according
whereunto
all
christians
would
finally
be
taken
into
grace
a
saying
of
paul
which
he
himself
gives
out
as
mysterious
stating
that
all
israel
will
be
saved
has
provided
much
food
for
reflexion
sundry
pious
persons
learned
also
but
daring
have
revived
the
opinion
of
origen
who
maintains
that
good
will
predominate
in
due
time
in
all
and
everywhere
and
that
all
rational
creatures
even
the
bad
angels
will
become
at
last
holy
and
blessed
the
book
of
the
eternal
gospel
published
lately
in
german
and
supported
by
a
great
and
learned
work
entitled
greek
pántôn
has
caused
much
stir
over
this
great
paradox
le
clerc
also
has
ingeniously
pleaded
the
cause
of
the
origenists
but
without
declaring
himself
for
them
there
is
a
man
of
wit
who
pushing
my
principle
of
harmony
even
to
arbitrary
suppositions
that
i
in
no
wise
approve
has
created
for
himself
a
theology
astronomical
he
believes
that
the
present
confusion
in
this
world
below
began
when
the
presiding
angel
of
the
globe
of
the
earth
which
was
still
a
sun
that
is
a
star
that
was
fixed
and
luminous
of
itself
committed
a
sin
with
some
lesser
angels
of
his
department
perhaps
rising
inopportunely
against
an
angel
of
a
greater
sun
that
simultaneously
by
the
harmony
of
the
realms
of
nature
and
of
grace
and
consequently
by
natural
causes
occurring
at
the
appointed
time
our
globe
was
covered
with
stains
rendered
opaque
and
driven
from
its
place
which
has
made
it
become
a
wandering
star
or
planet
that
is
a
satellite
of
another
sun
and
even
perhaps
of
that
one
whose
superiority
its
angel
refused
to
recognize
and
that
therein
consists
the
fall
of
lucifer
now
the
chief
of
the
bad
angels
who
in
holy
scripture
is
named
the
prince
and
even
the
god
of
this
world
being
with
the
angels
of
his
train
envious
of
that
rational
animal
which
walks
on
the
surface
of
this
globe
and
which
god
has
set
up
there
perhaps
to
compensate
himself
for
their
fall
strives
to
render
it
accessary
in
their
crimes
and
a
participator
in
their
misfortunes
whereupon
jesus
christ
came
to
save
men
he
is
the
eternal
son
of
god
even
as
he
is
his
only
son
but
according
to
some
ancient
christians
and
according
to
the
author
of
this
hypothesis
having
taken
upon
him
at
first
from
the
beginning
of
things
the
most
excellent
nature
among
created
beings
to
bring
them
all
to
perfection
he
set
himself
amongst
them
and
this
is
the
second
filiation
whereby
he
is
the
of
all
creatures
this
is
he
whom
the
cabalists
called
adam
kadmon
haply
he
had
planted
his
tabernacle
in
that
great
sun
which
illumines
us
but
he
came
at
last
into
this
globe
where
we
are
he
was
born
of
the
virgin
and
took
human
nature
upon
him
to
save
mankind
from
the
hands
of
their
enemy
and
his
and
when
the
time
of
judgement
shall
draw
near
when
the
present
face
of
our
globe
shall
be
about
to
perish
he
will
return
to
it
in
visible
form
thence
to
withdraw
the
good
transplanting
them
it
may
be
into
the
sun
and
to
punish
here
the
wicked
with
the
demons
that
have
allured
them
then
the
globe
of
the
earth
will
begin
to
burn
and
will
be
perhaps
a
comet
this
fire
will
last
for
aeons
upon
aeons
the
tail
of
the
comet
is
intended
by
the
smoke
which
will
rise
incessantly
according
to
the
apocalypse
and
this
fire
will
be
hell
or
the
second
death
whereof
holy
scripture
speaks
but
at
last
hell
will
render
up
its
dead
death
itself
will
be
destroyed
reason
and
peace
will
begin
to
hold
sway
again
in
the
spirits
that
had
been
perverted
they
will
be
sensible
of
their
error
they
will
adore
their
creator
and
will
even
begin
to
love
him
all
the
more
for
seeing
the
greatness
of
the
abyss
whence
they
emerge
simultaneously
by
virtue
of
the
of
the
realms
of
nature
and
of
grace
this
long
and
great
conflagration
will
have
purged
the
earth
globe
of
its
stains
it
will
become
again
a
sun
its
presiding
angel
will
resume
his
place
with
the
angels
of
his
train
humans
that
were
damned
shall
be
with
them
numbered
amongst
the
good
angels
this
chief
of
our
globe
shall
render
homage
to
the
messiah
chief
of
created
beings
the
glory
of
this
angel
reconciled
shall
be
greater
than
it
was
before
his
fall
deos
iterum
factorum
lege
aeternum
noster

the
vision
seemed
to
me
pleasing
and
worthy
of
a
follower
of
origen
but
we
have
no
need
of
such
hypothesis
or
fictions
where
wit
plays
a
greater
part
than
revelation
and
which
even
reason
can
not
turn
to
account
for
it
does
not
appear
that
there
is
one
principal
place
in
the
known
universe
deserving
in
preference
to
the
rest
to
be
the
seat
of
the
eldest
of
created
beings
and
the
sun
of
our
system
at
least
is
not
it
holding
then
to
the
established
doctrine
that
the
number
of
men
damned
eternally
will
be
incomparably
greater
than
that
of
the
saved
we
must
say
that
the
evil
could
not
but
seem
to
be
almost
as
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
good
when
one
contemplates
the
true
vastness
of
the
city
of
god
coelius
secundus
curio
wrote
a
little
book
amplitudine
regni
which
was
reprinted
not
long
since
but
he
is
indeed
far
from
having
apprehended
the
compass
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
the
ancients
had
puny
ideas
on
the
works
of
god
and
augustine
for
want
of
knowing
modern
discoveries
was
at
a
loss
when
there
was
question
of
explaining
the
prevalence
of
evil
it
seemed
to
the
ancients
that
there
was
only
one
earth
inhabited
and
even
of
that
men
held
the
antipodes
in
dread
the
remainder
of
the
world
was
according
to
them
a
few
shining
globes
and
a
few
crystalline
spheres
whatever
bounds
are
given
or
not
given
to
the
universe
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
there
is
an
infinite
number
of
globes
as
great
as
and
greater
than
ours
which
have
as
much
right
as
it
to
hold
rational
inhabitants
though
it
follows
not
at
all
that
they
are
human
it
is
only
one
planet
that
is
to
say
one
of
the
six
principal
satellites
of
our
sun
and
as
all
fixed
stars
are
suns
also
we
see
how
small
a
thing
our
earth
is
in
relation
to
visible
things
since
it
is
only
an
appendix
of
one
amongst
them
it
may
be
that
all
suns
are
peopled
only
by
blessed
creatures
and
nothing
constrains
us
to
think
that
many
are
damned
for
few
instances
or
few
samples
suffice
to
show
the
advantage
which
good
extracts
from
evil
moreover
since
there
is
no
reason
for
the
belief
that
there
are
stars
everywhere
is
it
not
possible
that
there
may
be
a
great
space
beyond
the
region
of
the
stars
whether
it
be
the
empyrean
heaven
or
not
this
immense
space
encircling
all
this
region
may
in
any
case
be
filled
with
happiness
and
glory
it
can
be
imagined
as
like
the
ocean
whither
flow
the
rivers
of
all
blessed
creatures
when
they
shall
have
reached
their
perfection
in
the
system
of
the
stars
what
will
become
of
the
consideration
of
our
globe
and
its
inhabitants
will
it
not
be
something
incomparably
less
than
a
physical
point
since
our
earth
is
as
a
point
in
comparison
with
the
distance
of
some
fixed
stars
thus
since
the
proportion
of
that
part
of
the
universe
which
we
know
is
almost
lost
in
nothingness
compared
with
that
which
is
unknown
and
which
we
yet
have
cause
to
assume
and
since
all
the
evils
that
may
be
raised
in
objection
before
us
are
in
this
near
nothingness
haply
it
may
be
that
all
evils
are
almost
nothingness
in
comparison
with
the
good
things
which
are
in
the
universe
but
it
is
necessary
also
to
meet
the
more
speculative
and
metaphysical
difficulties
which
have
been
mentioned
and
which
concern
the
cause
of
evil
the
question
is
asked
first
of
all
whence
does
evil
come
deus
est
unde
malum
si
non
est
unde
bonum
the
ancients
attributed
the
cause
of
evil
to
which
they
believed
uncreate
and
independent
of
god
but
we
who
derive
all
being
from
god
where
shall
we
find
the
source
of
evil
the
answer
is
that
it
must
be
sought
in
the
ideal
nature
of
the
creature
in
so
far
as
this
nature
is
contained
in
the
eternal
verities
which
are
in
the
understanding
of
god
independently
of
his
will
for
we
must
consider
that
there
is
an
imperfection
in
the
before
sin
because
the
creature
is
limited
in
its
essence
whence
ensues
that
it
can
not
know
all
and
that
it
can
deceive
itself
and
commit
other
errors
plato
said
in
that
the
world
originated
in
understanding
united
to
necessity
others
have
united
god
and
nature
this
can
be
given
a
reasonable
meaning
god
will
be
the
understanding
and
the
necessity
that
is
the
essential
nature
of
things
will
be
the
object
of
the
understanding
in
so
far
as
this
object
consists
in
the
eternal
verities
but
this
object
is
inward
and
abides
in
the
divine
understanding
and
therein
is
found
not
only
the
primitive
form
of
good
but
also
the
origin
of
evil
the
region
of
the
eternal
verities
must
be
substituted
for
matter
when
we
are
concerned
with
seeking
out
the
source
of
things
this
region
is
the
ideal
cause
of
evil
as
it
were
as
well
as
of
good
but
properly
speaking
the
formal
character
of
evil
has
no
cause
for
it
consists
in
privation
as
we
shall
see
namely
in
that
which
the
efficient
cause
does
not
bring
about
that
is
why
the
schoolmen
are
wont
to
call
the
cause
of
evil
evil
may
be
taken
metaphysically
physically
and
morally
consists
in
mere
imperfection
in
suffering
and
in
sin
now
although
physical
evil
and
moral
evil
be
not
necessary
it
is
enough
that
by
virtue
of
the
eternal
verities
they
be
possible
and
as
this
vast
region
of
verities
contains
all
possibilities
it
is
necessary
that
there
be
an
infinitude
of
possible
worlds
that
evil
enter
into
divers
of
them
and
that
even
the
best
of
all
contain
a
measure
thereof
thus
has
god
been
induced
to
permit
evil
but
someone
will
say
to
me
why
speak
you
to
us
of
is
it
not
god
that
doeth
the
evil
and
that
willeth
it
here
it
will
be
necessary
to
explain
what
is
so
that
it
may
be
seen
how
this
term
is
not
employed
without
reason
but
before
that
one
must
explain
the
nature
of
will
which
has
its
own
degrees
taking
it
in
the
general
sense
one
may
say
that
consists
in
the
inclination
to
do
something
in
proportion
to
the
good
it
contains
this
will
is
called
when
it
is
detached
and
considers
each
good
separately
in
the
capacity
of
a
good
in
this
sense
it
may
be
said
that
god
tends
to
all
good
as
good
perfectionem
simpliciter
to
speak
like
the
schoolmen
and
that
by
an
antecedent
will
he
is
earnestly
disposed
to
sanctify
and
to
save
all
men
to
exclude
sin
and
to
prevent
damnation
it
may
even
be
said
that
this
will
is
efficacious
itself
per
se
that
is
in
such
sort
that
the
effect
would
ensue
if
there
were
not
some
stronger
reason
to
prevent
it
for
this
will
does
not
pass
into
final
exercise
summum
else
it
would
never
fail
to
produce
its
full
effect
god
being
the
master
of
all
things
success
entire
and
infallible
belongs
only
to
the
as
it
is
called
this
it
is
which
is
complete
and
in
regard
to
it
this
rule
obtains
that
one
never
fails
to
do
what
one
wills
when
one
has
the
power
now
this
consequent
will
final
and
decisive
results
from
the
conflict
of
all
the
antecedent
wills
of
those
which
tend
towards
good
even
as
of
those
which
repel
evil
and
from
the
concurrence
of
all
these
particular
wills
comes
the
total
will
so
in
mechanics
compound
movement
results
from
all
the
tendencies
that
concur
in
one
and
the
same
moving
body
and
satisfies
each
one
equally
in
so
far
as
it
is
possible
to
do
all
at
one
time
it
is
as
if
the
moving
body
took
equal
account
of
these
tendencies
as
i
once
showed
in
one
of
the
paris
journals
when
giving
the
general
law
of
the
compositions
of
movement
in
this
sense
also
it
may
be
said
that
the
antecedent
will
is
efficacious
in
a
sense
and
even
effective
with
success
thence
it
follows
that
god
wills
the
good
and
the
best
and
as
for
evil
god
wills
moral
evil
not
at
all
and
physical
evil
or
suffering
he
does
not
will
absolutely
thus
it
is
that
there
is
no
absolute
predestination
to
damnation
and
one
may
say
of
physical
evil
that
god
wills
it
often
as
a
penalty
owing
to
guilt
and
often
also
as
a
means
to
an
end
that
is
to
prevent
greater
evils
or
to
obtain
greater
good
the
penalty
serves
also
for
amendment
and
example
evil
often
serves
to
make
us
savour
good
the
more
sometimes
too
it
contributes
to
a
greater
perfection
in
him
who
suffers
it
as
the
seed
that
one
sows
is
subject
to
a
kind
of
corruption
before
it
can
germinate
this
is
a
beautiful
similitude
which
jesus
christ
himself
used
concerning
sin
or
moral
evil
although
it
happens
very
often
that
it
may
serve
as
a
means
of
obtaining
good
or
of
preventing
another
evil
it
is
not
this
that
renders
it
a
sufficient
object
of
the
divine
will
or
a
legitimate
object
of
a
created
will
it
must
only
be
admitted
or
in
so
far
as
it
is
considered
to
be
a
certain
consequence
of
an
indispensable
duty
as
for
instance
if
a
man
who
was
determined
not
to
permit
another
sin
were
to
fail
of
his
own
duty
or
as
if
an
officer
on
guard
at
an
important
post
were
to
leave
it
especially
in
time
of
danger
in
order
to
prevent
a
quarrel
in
the
town
between
two
soldiers
of
the
garrison
who
wanted
to
kill
each
other
the
rule
which
states
esse
facienda
mala
ut
eveniant
and
which
even
forbids
the
permission
of
a
moral
evil
with
the
end
of
obtaining
a
physical
good
far
from
being
violated
is
here
proved
and
its
source
and
its
reason
are
demonstrated
one
will
not
approve
the
action
of
a
queen
who
under
the
pretext
of
saving
the
state
commits
or
even
permits
a
crime
the
crime
is
certain
and
the
evil
for
the
state
is
open
to
question
moreover
this
manner
of
giving
sanction
to
crimes
if
it
were
accepted
would
be
worse
than
a
disruption
of
some
one
country
which
is
liable
enough
to
happen
in
any
case
and
would
perchance
happen
all
the
more
by
reason
of
such
means
chosen
to
prevent
it
but
in
relation
to
god
nothing
is
open
to
question
nothing
can
be
opposed
to
rule
of
the
which
suffers
neither
exception
nor
dispensation
it
is
in
this
sense
that
god
permits
sin
for
he
would
fail
in
what
he
owes
to
himself
in
what
he
owes
to
his
wisdom
his
goodness
his
perfection
if
he
followed
not
the
grand
result
of
all
his
tendencies
to
good
and
if
he
chose
not
that
which
is
absolutely
the
best
notwithstanding
the
evil
of
guilt
which
is
involved
therein
by
the
supreme
necessity
of
the
eternal
verities
hence
the
conclusion
that
god
wills
all
good
himself
that
he
wills
the
best
as
an
that
he
wills
what
is
indifferent
and
physical
evil
sometimes
as
a
but
that
he
will
only
permit
moral
evil
as
the
quo
or
as
a
hypothetical
necessity
which
connects
it
with
the
best
therefore
the
of
god
which
has
sin
for
its
object
is
only
it
is
again
well
to
consider
that
moral
evil
is
an
evil
so
great
only
because
it
is
a
source
of
physical
evils
a
source
existing
in
one
of
the
most
powerful
of
creatures
who
is
also
most
capable
of
causing
those
evils
for
an
evil
will
is
in
its
department
what
the
evil
principle
of
the
manichaeans
would
be
in
the
universe
and
reason
which
is
an
image
of
the
divinity
provides
for
evil
souls
great
means
of
causing
much
evil
one
single
caligula
one
nero
has
caused
more
evil
than
an
earthquake
an
evil
man
takes
pleasure
in
causing
suffering
and
destruction
and
for
that
there
are
only
too
many
opportunities
but
god
being
inclined
to
produce
as
much
good
as
possible
and
having
all
the
knowledge
and
all
the
power
necessary
for
that
it
is
impossible
that
in
him
there
be
fault
or
guilt
or
sin
and
when
he
permits
sin
it
is
wisdom
it
is
virtue
it
is
indeed
beyond
question
that
we
must
refrain
from
preventing
the
sin
of
others
when
we
can
not
prevent
their
sin
without
sinning
ourselves
but
someone
will
perhaps
bring
up
the
objection
that
it
is
god
himself
who
acts
and
who
effects
all
that
is
real
in
the
sin
of
the
creature
this
objection
leads
us
to
consider
the
of
god
with
the
creature
after
we
have
examined
the
which
was
the
more
perplexing
some
have
believed
with
the
celebrated
durand
de
and
cardinal
aureolus
the
famous
schoolman
that
the
of
god
with
the
creature
i
mean
the
physical
cooperation
is
only
general
and
mediate
and
that
god
creates
substances
and
gives
them
the
force
they
need
and
that
thereafter
he
leaves
them
to
themselves
and
does
naught
but
conserve
them
without
aiding
them
in
their
actions
this
opinion
has
been
refuted
by
the
greater
number
of
scholastic
theologians
and
it
appears
that
in
the
past
it
met
with
disapproval
in
the
writings
of
pelagius
nevertheless
a
capuchin
named
louis
pereir
of
dole
about
the
year
wrote
a
book
expressly
to
revive
it
at
least
in
relation
to
free
actions
some
moderns
incline
thereto
and
bernier
supports
it
in
a
little
book
on
freedom
and
freewill
but
one
can
not
say
in
relation
to
god
what
conserve
is
without
reverting
to
the
general
opinion
also
it
must
be
taken
into
account
that
the
action
of
god
in
conserving
should
have
some
reference
to
that
which
is
conserved
according
to
what
it
is
and
to
the
state
wherein
it
is
thus
his
action
can
not
be
general
or
indeterminate
these
generalities
are
abstractions
not
to
be
found
in
the
truth
of
individual
things
and
the
conservation
of
a
man
standing
is
different
from
the
conservation
of
a
man
seated
this
would
not
be
so
if
conservation
consisted
only
in
the
act
of
preventing
and
warding
off
some
foreign
cause
which
could
destroy
that
which
one
wishes
to
conserve
as
often
happens
when
men
conserve
something
but
apart
from
the
fact
that
we
are
obliged
ourselves
sometimes
to
maintain
that
which
we
conserve
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
conservation
by
god
consists
in
the
perpetual
immediate
influence
which
the
dependence
of
creatures
demands
this
dependence
attaches
not
only
to
the
substance
but
also
to
the
action
and
one
can
perhaps
not
explain
it
better
than
by
saying
with
theologians
and
philosophers
in
general
that
it
is
a
continued
creation
the
objection
will
be
made
that
god
therefore
now
creates
man
a
sinner
he
that
in
the
beginning
created
him
innocent
but
here
it
must
be
said
with
regard
to
the
moral
aspect
that
god
being
supremely
wise
can
not
fail
to
observe
certain
laws
and
to
act
according
to
the
rules
as
well
physical
as
moral
that
wisdom
has
made
him
choose
and
the
same
reason
that
has
made
him
create
man
innocent
but
liable
to
fall
makes
him
man
when
he
falls
for
god
knowledge
causes
the
future
to
be
for
him
as
the
present
and
prevents
him
from
rescinding
the
resolutions
made
as
for
physical
here
one
must
consider
the
truth
which
has
made
already
so
much
stir
in
the
schools
since
augustine
declared
it
that
evil
is
a
privation
of
being
whereas
the
action
of
god
tends
to
the
positive
this
answer
is
accounted
a
quibble
and
even
something
chimerical
in
the
minds
of
many
people
but
here
is
an
instance
somewhat
similar
which
will
serve
to
disabuse
them
the
celebrated
kepler
and
descartes
in
his
letters
after
him
have
spoken
of
the
inertia
of
bodies
and
it
is
something
which
may
be
regarded
as
a
perfect
image
and
even
as
a
sample
of
the
original
limitation
of
creatures
to
show
that
privation
constitutes
the
formal
character
of
the
imperfections
and
disadvantages
that
are
in
substance
as
well
as
in
its
actions
let
us
suppose
that
the
current
of
one
and
the
same
river
carried
along
with
it
various
boats
which
differ
among
themselves
only
in
the
cargo
some
being
laden
with
wood
others
with
stone
and
some
more
the
others
less
that
being
so
it
will
come
about
that
the
boats
most
heavily
laden
will
go
more
slowly
than
the
others
provided
it
be
assumed
that
the
wind
or
the
oar
or
some
other
similar
means
assist
them
not
at
all
it
is
not
properly
speaking
weight
which
is
the
cause
of
this
retardation
since
the
boats
are
going
down
and
not
upwards
but
it
is
the
same
cause
which
also
increases
the
weight
in
bodies
that
have
greater
density
which
are
that
is
to
say
less
porous
and
more
charged
with
matter
that
is
proper
to
them
for
the
matter
which
passes
through
the
pores
not
receiving
the
same
movement
must
not
be
taken
into
account
it
is
therefore
matter
itself
which
originally
is
inclined
to
slowness
or
privation
of
speed
not
indeed
of
itself
to
lessen
this
speed
having
once
received
it
since
that
would
be
action
but
to
moderate
by
its
receptivity
the
effect
of
the
impression
when
it
is
to
receive
it
consequently
since
more
matter
is
moved
by
the
same
force
of
the
current
when
the
boat
is
more
laden
it
is
necessary
that
it
go
more
slowly
and
experiments
on
the
impact
of
bodies
as
well
as
reason
show
that
twice
as
much
force
must
be
employed
to
give
equal
speed
to
a
body
of
the
same
matter
but
of
twice
the
size
but
that
indeed
would
not
be
necessary
if
the
matter
were
absolutely
indifferent
to
repose
and
to
movement
and
if
it
had
not
this
natural
inertia
whereof
we
have
just
spoken
to
give
it
a
kind
of
repugnance
to
being
moved
let
us
now
compare
the
force
which
the
current
exercises
on
boats
and
communicates
to
them
with
the
action
of
god
who
produces
and
conserves
whatever
is
positive
in
creatures
and
gives
them
perfection
being
and
force
let
us
compare
i
say
the
inertia
of
matter
with
the
natural
imperfection
of
creatures
and
the
slowness
of
the
laden
boat
with
the
defects
to
be
found
in
the
qualities
and
the
action
of
the
creature
and
we
shall
find
that
there
is
nothing
so
just
as
this
comparison
the
current
is
the
cause
of
the
boat
movement
but
not
of
its
retardation
god
is
the
cause
of
perfection
in
the
nature
and
the
actions
of
the
creature
but
the
limitation
of
the
receptivity
of
the
creature
is
the
cause
of
the
defects
there
are
in
its
action
thus
the
platonists
augustine
and
the
schoolmen
were
right
to
say
that
god
is
the
cause
of
the
material
element
of
evil
which
lies
in
the
positive
and
not
of
the
formal
element
which
lies
in
privation
even
so
one
may
say
that
the
current
is
the
cause
of
the
material
element
of
the
retardation
but
not
of
the
formal
that
is
it
is
the
cause
of
the
boat
speed
without
being
the
cause
of
the
limits
to
this
speed
and
god
is
no
more
the
cause
of
sin
than
the
river
current
is
the
cause
of
the
retardation
of
the
boat
force
also
in
relation
to
matter
is
as
the
spirit
in
relation
to
the
flesh
the
spirit
is
willing
and
the
flesh
is
weak
and
spirits
act
non
noxia
corpora
there
is
then
a
wholly
similar
relation
between
such
and
such
an
action
of
god
and
such
and
such
a
passion
or
reception
of
the
creature
which
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things
is
perfected
only
in
proportion
to
its
such
is
the
term
used
and
when
it
is
said
that
the
creature
depends
upon
god
in
so
far
as
it
exists
and
in
so
far
as
it
acts
and
even
that
conservation
is
a
continual
creation
this
is
true
in
that
god
gives
ever
to
the
creature
and
produces
continually
all
that
in
it
is
positive
good
and
perfect
every
perfect
gift
coming
from
the
father
of
lights
the
imperfections
on
the
other
hand
and
the
defects
in
operations
spring
from
the
original
limitation
that
the
creature
could
not
but
receive
with
the
first
beginning
of
its
being
through
the
ideal
reasons
which
restrict
it
for
god
could
not
give
the
creature
all
without
making
of
it
a
god
therefore
there
must
needs
be
different
degrees
in
the
perfection
of
things
and
limitations
also
of
every
kind
this
consideration
will
serve
also
to
satisfy
some
modern
philosophers
who
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
god
is
the
only
agent
it
is
true
that
god
is
the
only
one
whose
action
is
pure
and
without
admixture
of
what
is
termed
suffer
but
that
does
not
preclude
the
creature
participation
in
actions
since
action
of
the
is
a
modification
of
the
substance
flowing
naturally
from
it
and
containing
a
variation
not
only
in
the
perfections
that
god
has
communicated
to
the
creature
but
also
in
the
limitations
that
the
creature
being
what
it
is
brings
with
it
thus
we
see
that
there
is
an
actual
distinction
between
the
substance
and
its
modification
or
accidents
contrary
to
the
opinion
of
some
moderns
and
in
particular
of
the
late
duke
of
buckingham
who
spoke
of
that
in
a
little
on
recently
reprinted
evil
is
therefore
like
darkness
and
not
only
ignorance
but
also
error
and
malice
consist
formally
in
a
certain
kind
of
privation
here
is
an
example
of
error
which
we
have
already
employed
i
see
a
tower
which
from
a
distance
appears
round
although
it
is
square
the
thought
that
the
tower
is
what
it
appears
to
be
flows
naturally
from
that
which
i
see
and
when
i
dwell
on
this
thought
it
is
an
affirmation
it
is
a
false
judgement
but
if
i
pursue
the
examination
if
some
reflexion
causes
me
to
perceive
that
appearances
deceive
me
lo
and
behold
i
abandon
my
error
to
abide
in
a
certain
place
or
not
to
go
further
not
to
espy
some
landmark
these
are
privations
it
is
the
same
in
respect
of
malice
or
ill
will
the
will
tends
towards
good
in
general
it
must
strive
after
the
perfection
that
befits
us
and
the
supreme
perfection
is
in
god
all
pleasures
have
within
themselves
some
feeling
of
perfection
but
when
one
is
limited
to
the
pleasures
of
the
senses
or
to
other
pleasures
to
the
detriment
of
greater
good
as
of
health
of
virtue
of
union
with
god
of
felicity
it
is
in
this
privation
of
a
further
aspiration
that
the
defect
consists
in
general
perfection
is
positive
it
is
an
absolute
reality
defect
is
privative
it
comes
from
limitation
and
tends
towards
new
privations
this
saying
is
therefore
as
true
as
it
is
ancient
ex
causa
integra
malum
ex
quolibet
as
also
that
which
states
causam
habet
non
efficientem
sed
and
i
hope
that
the
meaning
of
these
axioms
will
be
better
apprehended
after
what
i
have
just
said
the
physical
of
god
and
of
creatures
with
the
will
contributes
also
to
the
difficulties
existing
in
regard
to
freedom
i
am
of
opinion
that
our
will
is
exempt
not
only
from
constraint
but
also
from
necessity
aristotle
has
already
observed
that
there
are
two
things
in
freedom
to
wit
spontaneity
and
choice
and
therein
lies
our
mastery
over
our
actions
when
we
act
freely
we
are
not
being
forced
as
would
happen
if
we
were
pushed
on
to
a
precipice
and
thrown
from
top
to
bottom
and
we
are
not
prevented
from
having
the
mind
free
when
we
deliberate
as
would
happen
if
we
were
given
a
draught
to
deprive
us
of
discernment
there
is
in
a
thousand
actions
of
nature
but
when
there
is
no
judgement
in
him
who
acts
there
is
no
and
if
we
had
judgement
not
accompanied
by
any
inclination
to
act
our
soul
would
be
an
understanding
without
will
it
is
not
to
be
imagined
however
that
our
freedom
consists
in
an
indetermination
or
an
indifference
of
equipoise
as
if
one
must
needs
be
inclined
equally
to
the
side
of
yes
and
of
no
and
in
the
direction
of
different
courses
when
there
are
several
of
them
to
take
this
equipoise
in
all
directions
is
impossible
for
if
we
were
equally
inclined
towards
the
courses
a
b
and
c
we
could
not
be
equally
inclined
towards
a
and
towards
not
a
this
equipoise
is
also
absolutely
contrary
to
experience
and
in
scrutinizing
oneself
one
will
find
that
there
has
always
been
some
cause
or
reason
inclining
us
towards
the
course
taken
although
very
often
we
be
not
aware
of
that
which
prompts
us
just
in
the
same
way
one
is
hardly
aware
why
on
issuing
from
a
door
one
has
placed
the
right
foot
before
the
left
or
the
left
before
the
right
but
let
us
pass
to
the
difficulties
philosophers
agree
that
the
truth
of
contingent
futurities
is
determinate
that
is
to
say
that
contingent
futurities
are
future
or
that
they
will
be
that
they
will
happen
for
it
is
as
sure
that
the
future
will
be
as
it
is
sure
that
the
past
has
been
it
was
true
already
a
hundred
years
ago
that
i
should
write
as
it
will
be
true
after
a
hundred
years
that
i
have
written
thus
the
contingent
is
not
because
it
is
future
any
the
less
contingent
and
which
would
be
called
certainty
if
it
were
known
is
not
incompatible
with
contingency
often
the
certain
and
the
determinate
are
taken
as
one
thing
because
a
determinate
truth
is
capable
of
being
known
thus
it
may
be
said
that
determination
is
an
objective
certainty
this
determination
comes
from
the
very
nature
of
truth
and
can
not
injure
freedom
but
there
are
other
determinations
taken
from
elsewhere
and
in
the
first
place
from
the
foreknowledge
of
god
which
many
have
held
to
be
contrary
to
freedom
they
say
that
what
is
foreseen
can
not
fail
to
exist
and
they
say
so
truly
but
it
follows
not
that
what
is
foreseen
is
necessary
for
is
that
whereof
the
contrary
is
impossible
or
implies
contradiction
now
this
truth
which
states
that
i
shall
write
tomorrow
is
not
of
that
nature
it
is
not
necessary
yet
supposing
that
god
foresees
it
it
is
necessary
that
it
come
to
pass
that
is
the
consequence
is
necessary
namely
that
it
exist
since
it
has
been
foreseen
for
god
is
infallible
this
is
what
is
termed
a
but
our
concern
is
not
this
necessity
it
is
an
that
is
required
to
be
able
to
say
that
an
action
is
necessary
that
it
is
not
contingent
that
it
is
not
the
effect
of
a
free
choice
besides
it
is
very
easily
seen
that
foreknowledge
in
itself
adds
nothing
to
the
determination
of
the
truth
of
contingent
futurities
save
that
this
determination
is
known
and
this
does
not
augment
the
determination
or
the
as
it
is
termed
of
these
events
that
whereon
we
agreed
at
the
outset
this
answer
is
doubtless
very
correct
it
is
agreed
that
foreknowledge
in
itself
does
not
make
truth
more
determinate
truth
is
foreseen
because
it
is
determinate
because
it
is
true
but
it
is
not
true
because
it
is
foreseen
and
therein
the
knowledge
of
the
future
has
nothing
that
is
not
also
in
the
knowledge
of
the
past
or
of
the
present
but
here
is
what
an
opponent
will
be
able
to
say
i
grant
you
that
foreknowledge
in
itself
does
not
make
truth
more
determinate
but
it
is
the
cause
of
the
foreknowledge
that
makes
it
so
for
it
needs
must
be
that
the
foreknowledge
of
god
have
its
foundation
in
the
nature
of
things
and
this
foundation
making
the
truth
will
prevent
it
from
being
contingent
and
free
it
is
this
difficulty
that
has
caused
two
parties
to
spring
up
one
of
the
the
other
of
the
supporters
of
the
dominicans
and
the
augustinians
are
for
predetermination
the
franciscans
and
the
modern
jesuits
on
the
other
hand
are
for
mediate
knowledge
these
two
parties
appeared
towards
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
and
a
little
later
molina
himself
who
is
perhaps
one
of
the
first
with
fonseca
to
have
systematized
this
point
and
from
whom
the
others
derived
their
name
of
molinists
says
in
the
book
that
he
wrote
on
the
reconciliation
of
freewill
with
grace
about
the
year
that
the
spanish
doctors
he
means
principally
the
thomists
who
had
been
writing
then
for
twenty
years
finding
no
other
way
to
explain
how
god
could
have
a
certain
knowledge
of
contingent
futurities
had
introduced
predetermination
as
being
necessary
to
free
actions
as
for
himself
he
thought
to
have
found
another
way
he
considers
that
there
are
three
objects
of
divine
knowledge
the
possibles
the
actual
events
and
the
conditional
events
that
would
happen
in
consequence
of
a
certain
condition
if
it
were
translated
into
action
the
knowledge
of
possibilities
is
what
is
called
the
of
mere
intelligence
that
of
events
occurring
actually
in
the
progress
of
the
universe
is
called
the
of
intuition
and
as
there
is
a
kind
of
mean
between
the
merely
possible
and
the
pure
and
absolute
event
to
wit
the
conditional
event
it
can
be
said
also
according
to
molina
that
there
is
a
mediate
knowledge
between
that
of
intuition
and
that
of
intelligence
instance
is
given
of
the
famous
example
of
david
asking
the
divine
oracle
whether
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
of
keilah
where
he
designed
to
shut
himself
in
would
deliver
him
to
saul
supposing
that
saul
should
besiege
the
town
god
answered
yes
whereupon
david
took
a
different
course
now
some
advocates
of
this
mediate
knowledge
are
of
opinion
that
god
foreseeing
what
men
would
do
of
their
own
accord
supposing
they
were
placed
in
such
and
such
circumstances
and
knowing
that
they
would
make
ill
use
of
their
free
will
decrees
to
refuse
them
grace
and
favourable
circumstances
and
he
may
justly
so
decree
since
in
any
case
these
circumstances
and
these
aids
would
not
have
served
them
aught
but
molina
contents
himself
with
finding
therein
generally
a
reason
for
the
decrees
of
god
founded
on
what
the
free
creature
would
do
in
such
and
such
circumstances
i
will
not
enter
into
all
the
detail
of
this
controversy
it
will
suffice
for
me
to
give
one
instance
certain
older
writers
not
acceptable
to
augustine
and
his
first
disciples
appear
to
have
had
ideas
somewhat
approaching
those
of
molina
the
thomists
and
those
who
call
themselves
disciples
of
augustine
but
whom
their
opponents
call
jansenists
combat
this
doctrine
on
philosophical
and
theological
grounds
some
maintain
that
mediate
knowledge
must
be
included
in
the
knowledge
of
mere
intelligence
but
the
principal
objection
is
aimed
at
the
foundation
of
this
knowledge
for
what
foundation
can
god
have
for
seeing
what
the
people
of
keilah
would
do
a
simple
contingent
and
free
act
has
nothing
in
itself
to
yield
a
principle
of
certainty
unless
one
look
upon
it
as
predetermined
by
the
decrees
of
god
and
by
the
causes
that
are
dependent
upon
them
consequently
the
difficulty
existing
in
actual
free
actions
will
exist
also
in
conditional
free
actions
that
is
to
say
god
will
know
them
only
under
the
condition
of
their
causes
and
of
his
decrees
which
are
the
first
causes
of
things
and
it
will
not
be
possible
to
separate
such
actions
from
those
causes
so
as
to
know
a
contingent
event
in
a
way
that
is
independent
of
the
knowledge
of
its
causes
therefore
all
must
of
necessity
be
traced
back
to
the
predetermination
of
god
decrees
and
this
mediate
knowledge
so
it
will
be
said
will
offer
no
remedy
the
theologians
who
profess
to
be
adherents
of
augustine
claim
also
that
the
system
of
the
molinists
would
discover
the
source
of
god
grace
in
the
good
qualities
of
man
and
this
they
deem
an
infringement
of
god
honour
and
contrary
to
teaching
it
would
be
long
and
wearisome
to
enter
here
into
the
replies
and
rejoinders
coming
from
one
side
and
the
other
and
it
will
suffice
for
me
to
explain
how
i
conceive
that
there
is
truth
on
both
sides
for
this
result
i
resort
to
my
principle
of
an
infinitude
of
possible
worlds
represented
in
the
region
of
eternal
verities
that
is
in
the
object
of
the
divine
intelligence
where
all
conditional
futurities
must
be
comprised
for
the
case
of
the
siege
of
keilah
forms
part
of
a
possible
world
differs
from
ours
only
in
all
that
is
connected
with
this
and
the
idea
of
this
possible
world
represents
that
which
would
happen
in
this
case
thus
we
have
a
principle
for
the
certain
knowledge
of
contingent
futurities
whether
they
happen
actually
or
must
happen
in
a
certain
case
for
in
the
region
of
the
possibles
they
are
represented
as
they
are
namely
as
free
contingencies
therefore
neither
the
foreknowledge
of
contingent
futurities
nor
the
foundation
for
the
certainty
of
this
foreknowledge
should
cause
us
perplexity
or
seem
to
prejudice
freedom
and
though
it
were
true
and
possible
that
contingent
futurities
consisting
in
free
actions
of
reasonable
creatures
were
entirely
independent
of
the
decrees
of
god
and
of
external
causes
there
would
still
be
means
of
foreseeing
them
for
god
would
see
them
as
they
are
in
the
region
of
the
possibles
before
he
decrees
to
admit
them
into
existence
but
if
the
foreknowledge
of
god
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
dependence
or
independence
of
our
free
actions
it
is
not
so
with
the
foreordinance
of
god
his
decrees
and
the
sequence
of
causes
which
as
i
believe
always
contribute
to
the
determination
of
the
will
and
if
i
am
for
the
molinists
in
the
first
point
i
am
for
the
predeterminators
in
the
second
provided
always
that
predetermination
be
taken
as
not
necessitating
in
a
word
i
am
of
opinion
that
the
will
is
always
more
inclined
towards
the
course
it
adopts
but
that
it
is
never
bound
by
the
necessity
to
adopt
it
that
it
will
adopt
this
course
is
certain
but
it
is
not
necessary
the
case
corresponds
to
that
of
the
famous
saying
inclinant
non
although
here
the
similarity
is
not
complete
for
the
event
towards
which
the
stars
tend
to
speak
with
the
common
herd
as
if
there
were
some
foundation
for
astrology
does
not
always
come
to
pass
whereas
the
course
towards
which
the
will
is
more
inclined
never
fails
to
be
adopted
moreover
the
stars
would
form
only
a
part
of
the
inclinations
that
in
the
event
but
when
one
speaks
of
the
greater
inclination
of
the
will
one
speaks
of
the
result
of
all
the
inclinations
it
is
almost
as
we
have
spoken
above
of
the
consequent
will
in
god
which
results
from
all
the
antecedent
wills
nevertheless
objective
certainty
or
determination
does
not
bring
about
the
necessity
of
the
determinate
truth
all
philosophers
acknowledge
this
asserting
that
the
truth
of
contingent
futurities
is
determinate
and
that
nevertheless
they
remain
contingent
the
thing
indeed
would
imply
no
contradiction
in
itself
if
the
effect
did
not
follow
and
therein
lies
contingency
the
better
to
understand
this
point
we
must
take
into
account
that
there
are
two
great
principles
of
our
arguments
the
one
is
the
principle
of
stating
that
of
two
contradictory
propositions
the
one
is
true
the
other
false
the
other
principle
is
that
of
the
it
states
that
nothing
ever
comes
to
pass
without
there
being
a
cause
or
at
least
a
reason
determining
it
that
is
something
to
give
an
reason
why
it
is
existent
rather
than
and
in
this
wise
rather
than
in
any
other
this
great
principle
holds
for
all
events
and
a
contrary
instance
will
never
be
supplied
and
although
more
often
than
not
we
are
insufficiently
acquainted
with
these
determinant
reasons
we
perceive
nevertheless
that
there
are
such
were
it
not
for
this
great
principle
we
could
never
prove
the
existence
of
god
and
we
should
lose
an
infinitude
of
very
just
and
very
profitable
arguments
whereof
it
is
the
foundation
moreover
it
suffers
no
exception
for
otherwise
its
force
would
be
weakened
besides
nothing
is
so
weak
as
those
systems
where
all
is
unsteady
and
full
of
exceptions
that
fault
can
not
be
laid
to
the
charge
of
the
system
i
approve
where
everything
happens
in
accordance
with
general
rules
that
at
most
are
mutually
restrictive
we
must
therefore
not
imagine
with
some
schoolmen
whose
ideas
tend
towards
the
chimerical
that
free
contingent
futurities
have
the
privilege
of
exemption
from
this
general
rule
of
the
nature
of
things
there
is
always
a
prevailing
reason
which
prompts
the
will
to
its
choice
and
for
the
maintenance
of
freedom
for
the
will
it
suffices
that
this
reason
should
incline
without
necessitating
that
is
also
the
opinion
of
all
the
ancients
of
plato
of
aristotle
of
augustine
the
will
is
never
prompted
to
action
save
by
the
representation
of
the
good
which
prevails
over
the
opposite
representations
this
is
admitted
even
in
relation
to
god
the
good
angels
and
the
souls
in
bliss
and
it
is
acknowledged
that
they
are
none
the
less
free
in
consequence
of
that
god
fails
not
to
choose
the
best
but
he
is
not
constrained
so
to
do
nay
more
there
is
no
necessity
in
the
object
of
god
choice
for
another
sequence
of
things
is
equally
possible
for
that
very
reason
the
choice
is
free
and
independent
of
necessity
because
it
is
made
between
several
possibles
and
the
will
is
determined
only
by
the
preponderating
goodness
of
the
object
this
is
therefore
not
a
defect
where
god
and
the
saints
are
concerned
on
the
contrary
it
would
be
a
great
defect
or
rather
a
manifest
absurdity
were
it
otherwise
even
in
men
here
on
earth
and
if
they
were
capable
of
acting
without
any
inclining
reason
of
such
absurdity
no
example
will
ever
be
found
and
even
supposing
one
takes
a
certain
course
out
of
caprice
to
demonstrate
one
freedom
the
pleasure
or
advantage
one
thinks
to
find
in
this
conceit
is
one
of
the
reasons
tending
towards
it
there
is
therefore
a
freedom
of
contingency
or
in
a
way
of
indifference
provided
that
by
is
understood
that
nothing
necessitates
us
to
one
course
or
the
other
but
there
is
never
any
of
that
is
where
all
is
completely
even
on
both
sides
without
any
inclination
towards
either
innumerable
great
and
small
movements
internal
and
external
with
us
for
the
most
part
unperceived
by
us
and
i
have
already
said
that
when
one
leaves
a
room
there
are
such
and
such
reasons
determining
us
to
put
the
one
foot
first
without
pausing
to
reflect
for
there
is
not
everywhere
a
slave
as
in
trimalchio
house
in
petronius
to
cry
to
us
the
right
foot
first
all
that
we
have
just
said
agrees
entirely
also
with
the
maxims
of
the
philosophers
who
teach
that
a
cause
can
not
act
without
having
a
disposition
towards
action
it
is
this
disposition
which
contains
a
predetermination
whether
the
doer
have
received
it
from
without
or
have
had
it
in
consequence
of
his
own
antecedent
character
thus
we
have
no
need
to
resort
in
company
with
some
new
thomists
to
a
new
immediate
predetermination
by
god
such
as
may
cause
the
free
creature
to
abandon
his
indifference
and
to
a
decree
of
god
for
predetermining
the
creature
making
it
possible
for
god
to
know
what
the
creature
will
do
for
it
suffices
that
the
creature
be
predetermined
by
its
preceding
state
which
inclines
it
to
one
course
more
than
to
the
other
moreover
all
these
connexions
of
the
actions
of
the
creature
and
of
all
creatures
were
represented
in
the
divine
understanding
and
known
to
god
through
the
knowledge
of
mere
intelligence
before
he
had
decreed
to
give
them
existence
thus
we
see
that
in
order
to
account
for
the
foreknowledge
of
god
one
may
dispense
with
both
the
mediate
knowledge
of
the
molinists
and
the
predetermination
which
a
bañez
or
an
alvarez
writers
otherwise
of
great
profundity
have
taught
by
this
false
idea
of
an
indifference
of
equipoise
the
molinists
were
much
embarrassed
they
were
asked
not
only
how
it
was
possible
to
know
in
what
direction
a
cause
absolutely
indeterminate
would
be
determined
but
also
how
it
was
possible
that
there
should
finally
result
therefrom
a
determination
for
which
there
is
no
source
to
say
with
molina
that
it
is
the
privilege
of
the
free
cause
is
to
say
nothing
but
simply
to
grant
that
cause
the
privilege
of
being
chimerical
it
is
pleasing
to
see
their
harassed
efforts
to
emerge
from
a
labyrinth
whence
there
is
absolutely
no
means
of
egress
some
teach
that
the
will
before
it
is
determined
formally
must
be
determined
virtually
in
order
to
emerge
from
its
state
of
equipoise
and
father
louis
of
dole
in
his
book
on
the
of
quotes
molinists
who
attempt
to
take
refuge
in
this
expedient
for
they
are
compelled
to
acknowledge
that
the
cause
must
needs
be
disposed
to
act
but
they
gain
nothing
they
only
defer
the
difficulty
for
they
will
still
be
asked
how
the
free
cause
comes
to
be
determined
virtually
they
will
therefore
never
extricate
themselves
without
acknowledging
that
there
is
a
predetermination
in
the
preceding
state
of
the
free
creature
which
inclines
it
to
be
determined
in
consequence
of
this
the
case
also
of
buridan
ass
between
two
meadows
impelled
equally
towards
both
of
them
is
a
fiction
that
can
not
occur
in
the
universe
in
the
order
of
nature
although
bayle
be
of
another
opinion
it
is
true
that
if
the
case
were
possible
one
must
say
that
the
ass
would
starve
himself
to
death
but
fundamentally
the
question
deals
in
the
impossible
unless
it
be
that
god
bring
the
thing
about
expressly
for
the
universe
can
not
be
halved
by
a
plane
drawn
through
the
middle
of
the
ass
which
is
cut
vertically
through
its
length
so
that
all
is
equal
and
alike
on
both
sides
in
the
manner
wherein
an
ellipse
and
every
plane
figure
of
the
number
of
those
i
term
can
be
thus
halved
by
any
straight
line
passing
through
its
centre
neither
the
parts
of
the
universe
nor
the
viscera
of
the
animal
are
alike
nor
are
they
evenly
placed
on
both
sides
of
this
vertical
plane
there
will
therefore
always
be
many
things
in
the
ass
and
outside
the
ass
although
they
be
not
apparent
to
us
which
will
determine
him
to
go
on
one
side
rather
than
the
other
and
although
man
is
free
and
the
ass
is
not
nevertheless
for
the
same
reason
it
must
be
true
that
in
man
likewise
the
case
of
a
perfect
equipoise
between
two
courses
is
impossible
furthermore
it
is
true
that
an
angel
or
god
certainly
could
always
account
for
the
course
man
has
adopted
by
assigning
a
cause
or
a
predisposing
reason
which
has
actually
induced
him
to
adopt
it
yet
this
reason
would
often
be
complex
and
incomprehensible
to
ourselves
because
the
concatenation
of
causes
linked
together
is
very
long
hence
it
is
that
the
reason
descartes
has
advanced
to
prove
the
independence
of
our
free
actions
by
what
he
terms
an
intense
inward
sensation
has
no
force
we
can
not
properly
speaking
be
sensible
of
our
independence
and
we
are
not
aware
always
of
the
causes
often
imperceptible
whereon
our
resolution
depends
it
is
as
though
the
magnetic
needle
took
pleasure
in
turning
towards
the
north
for
it
would
think
that
it
was
turning
independently
of
any
other
cause
not
being
aware
of
the
imperceptible
movements
of
the
magnetic
matter
nevertheless
we
shall
see
later
in
what
sense
it
is
quite
true
that
the
human
soul
is
altogether
its
own
natural
principle
in
relation
to
its
actions
dependent
upon
itself
and
independent
of
all
other
creatures
as
for
itself
to
say
that
it
is
an
object
of
free
will
is
incorrect
we
will
to
act
strictly
speaking
and
we
do
not
will
to
will
else
we
could
still
say
that
we
will
to
have
the
will
to
will
and
that
would
go
on
to
infinity
besides
we
do
not
always
follow
the
latest
judgement
of
practical
understanding
when
we
resolve
to
will
but
we
always
follow
in
our
willing
the
result
of
all
the
inclinations
that
come
from
the
direction
both
of
reasons
and
passions
and
this
often
happens
without
an
express
judgement
of
the
understanding
all
is
therefore
certain
and
determined
beforehand
in
man
as
everywhere
else
and
the
human
soul
is
a
kind
of
although
contingent
actions
in
general
and
free
action
in
particular
are
not
on
that
account
necessary
with
an
absolute
necessity
which
would
be
truly
incompatible
with
contingency
thus
neither
futurition
in
itself
certain
as
it
is
nor
the
infallible
prevision
of
god
nor
the
predetermination
either
of
causes
or
of
god
decrees
destroys
this
contingency
and
this
freedom
that
is
acknowledged
in
respect
of
futurition
and
prevision
as
has
already
been
set
forth
since
moreover
god
decree
consists
solely
in
the
resolution
he
forms
after
having
compared
all
possible
worlds
to
choose
that
one
which
is
the
best
and
bring
it
into
existence
together
with
all
that
this
world
contains
by
means
of
the
word
it
is
plain
to
see
that
this
decree
changes
nothing
in
the
constitution
of
things
god
leaves
them
just
as
they
were
in
the
state
of
mere
possibility
that
is
changing
nothing
either
in
their
essence
or
nature
or
even
in
their
accidents
which
are
represented
perfectly
already
in
the
idea
of
this
possible
world
thus
that
which
is
contingent
and
free
remains
no
less
so
under
the
decrees
of
god
than
under
his
prevision
but
could
god
himself
it
will
be
said
then
change
nothing
in
the
world
assuredly
he
could
not
now
change
it
without
derogation
to
his
wisdom
since
he
has
foreseen
the
existence
of
this
world
and
of
what
it
contains
and
since
likewise
he
has
formed
this
resolution
to
bring
it
into
existence
for
he
can
not
be
mistaken
nor
repent
and
it
did
not
behove
him
to
from
an
imperfect
resolution
applying
to
one
part
and
not
the
whole
thus
all
being
ordered
from
the
beginning
it
is
only
because
of
this
hypothetical
necessity
recognized
by
everyone
that
after
prevision
or
after
his
resolution
nothing
can
be
changed
and
yet
the
events
in
themselves
remain
contingent
for
setting
aside
this
supposition
of
the
futurition
of
the
thing
and
of
the
prevision
or
of
the
resolution
of
god
a
supposition
which
already
lays
it
down
as
a
fact
that
the
thing
will
happen
and
in
accordance
with
which
one
must
say
quando
est
oportet
esse
aut
unumquodque
siquidem
erit
oportet
futurum
esse
the
event
has
nothing
in
it
to
render
it
necessary
and
to
suggest
that
no
other
thing
might
have
happened
in
its
stead
and
as
for
the
connexion
between
causes
and
effects
it
only
inclined
without
necessitating
the
free
agency
as
i
have
just
explained
thus
it
does
not
produce
even
a
hypothetical
necessity
save
in
conjunction
with
something
from
outside
to
wit
this
very
maxim
that
the
prevailing
inclination
always
triumphs
it
will
be
said
also
that
if
all
is
ordered
god
can
not
then
perform
miracles
but
one
must
bear
in
mind
that
the
miracles
which
happen
in
the
world
were
also
enfolded
and
represented
as
possible
in
this
same
world
considered
in
the
state
of
mere
possibility
and
god
who
has
since
performed
them
when
he
chose
this
world
had
even
then
decreed
to
perform
them
again
the
objection
will
be
made
that
vows
and
prayers
merits
and
demerits
good
and
bad
actions
avail
nothing
since
nothing
can
be
changed
this
objection
causes
most
perplexity
to
people
in
general
and
yet
it
is
purely
a
sophism
these
prayers
these
vows
these
good
or
bad
actions
that
occur
were
already
before
god
when
he
formed
the
resolution
to
order
things
those
things
which
happen
in
this
existing
world
were
represented
with
their
effects
and
their
consequences
in
the
idea
of
this
same
world
while
it
was
still
possible
only
they
were
represented
therein
attracting
god
grace
whether
natural
or
supernatural
requiring
punishments
or
rewards
just
as
it
has
happened
actually
in
this
world
since
god
chose
it
the
prayer
or
the
good
action
were
even
then
an
or
that
is
an
inclining
reason
able
to
contribute
to
the
grace
of
god
or
to
the
reward
as
it
now
does
in
reality
since
moreover
all
is
wisely
connected
together
in
the
world
it
is
clear
that
god
foreseeing
that
which
would
happen
freely
ordered
all
other
things
on
that
basis
beforehand
or
what
is
the
same
he
chose
that
possible
world
in
which
everything
was
ordered
in
this
fashion
this
consideration
demolishes
at
the
same
time
what
the
ancients
called
the
sophism
greek
logos
argos
which
ended
in
a
decision
to
do
nothing
for
people
would
say
if
what
i
ask
is
to
happen
it
will
happen
even
though
i
should
do
nothing
and
if
it
is
not
to
happen
it
will
never
happen
no
matter
what
trouble
i
take
to
achieve
it
this
necessity
supposedly
existent
in
events
and
detached
from
their
causes
might
be
termed
as
i
have
already
observed
above
because
a
similar
line
of
reasoning
so
it
is
said
causes
the
turks
not
to
shun
places
ravaged
by
plague
but
the
answer
is
quite
ready
the
effect
being
certain
the
cause
that
shall
produce
it
is
certain
also
and
if
the
effect
comes
about
it
will
be
by
virtue
of
a
proportionate
cause
thus
your
laziness
perchance
will
bring
it
about
that
you
will
obtain
naught
of
what
you
desire
and
that
you
will
fall
into
those
misfortunes
which
you
would
by
acting
with
care
have
avoided
we
see
therefore
that
the
of
causes
with
far
from
causing
an
unendurable
fatality
provides
rather
a
means
of
obviating
it
there
is
a
german
proverb
which
says
that
death
will
ever
have
a
cause
and
nothing
is
so
true
you
will
die
on
that
day
let
us
presume
it
is
so
and
that
god
foresees
it
yes
without
doubt
but
it
will
be
because
you
will
do
what
shall
lead
you
thither
it
is
likewise
with
the
chastisements
of
god
which
also
depend
upon
their
causes
and
it
will
be
apposite
in
this
connexion
to
quote
this
famous
passage
from
ambrose
in
cap
i
dominus
mutare
sententiam
si
tu
noveris
mutare
delictum
which
is
not
to
be
understood
as
of
reprobation
but
of
denunciation
such
as
that
which
jonah
dealt
out
for
god
to
the
ninevites
this
common
saying
non
es
praedestinatus
fac
ut
praedestineris
must
not
be
taken
literally
its
true
sense
being
that
he
who
has
doubts
of
his
predestination
need
only
do
what
is
required
for
him
to
obtain
it
by
the
grace
of
god
the
sophism
which
ends
in
a
decision
to
trouble
oneself
over
nothing
will
haply
be
useful
sometimes
to
induce
certain
people
to
face
danger
fearlessly
it
has
been
applied
in
particular
to
turkish
soldiers
but
it
seems
that
hashish
is
a
more
important
factor
than
this
sophism
not
to
mention
the
fact
that
this
resolute
spirit
in
the
turks
has
greatly
belied
itself
in
our
days
a
learned
physician
of
holland
named
johan
van
beverwyck
took
the
trouble
to
write
termino
and
to
collect
sundry
answers
letters
and
discourses
of
some
learned
men
of
his
time
on
this
subject
this
collection
has
been
printed
and
it
is
astonishing
to
see
there
how
often
people
are
misled
and
how
they
have
confused
a
problem
which
properly
speaking
is
the
easiest
in
the
world
after
that
it
is
no
wonder
that
there
are
very
many
doubts
which
the
human
race
can
not
abandon
the
truth
is
that
people
love
to
lose
themselves
and
this
is
a
kind
of
ramble
of
the
mind
which
is
unwilling
to
subject
itself
to
attention
to
order
to
rules
it
seems
as
though
we
are
so
accustomed
to
games
and
jesting
that
we
play
the
fool
even
in
the
most
serious
occupations
and
when
we
least
think
to
do
so
i
fear
that
in
the
recent
dispute
between
the
theologians
of
the
augsburg
confession
termino
paenitentiae
which
has
called
forth
so
many
treatises
in
germany
some
misunderstanding
though
of
a
different
nature
has
slipped
in
the
terms
prescribed
by
the
laws
are
amongst
lawyers
known
as
it
may
be
said
in
a
sense
that
the
prescribed
to
man
for
his
repentance
and
amendment
is
certain
in
the
sight
of
god
with
whom
all
is
certain
god
knows
when
a
sinner
will
be
so
hardened
that
thereafter
nothing
can
be
done
for
him
not
indeed
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
do
penance
or
that
sufficient
grace
needs
must
be
refused
to
him
after
a
certain
term
a
grace
that
never
fails
but
because
there
will
be
a
time
whereafter
he
will
no
more
approach
the
ways
of
salvation
but
we
never
have
certain
marks
for
recognizing
this
term
and
we
are
never
justified
in
considering
a
man
utterly
abandoned
that
would
be
to
pass
a
rash
judgement
it
were
better
always
to
have
room
for
hope
and
this
is
an
occasion
with
a
thousand
others
where
our
ignorance
is
beneficial
futuri
temporis
nocte
premit
the
whole
future
is
doubtless
determined
but
since
we
know
not
what
it
is
nor
what
is
foreseen
or
resolved
we
must
do
our
duty
according
to
the
reason
that
god
has
given
us
and
according
to
the
rules
that
he
has
prescribed
for
us
and
thereafter
we
must
have
a
quiet
mind
and
leave
to
god
himself
the
care
for
the
outcome
for
he
will
never
fail
to
do
that
which
shall
be
the
best
not
only
in
general
but
also
in
particular
for
those
who
have
true
confidence
in
him
that
is
a
confidence
composed
of
true
piety
a
lively
faith
and
fervent
charity
by
virtue
of
which
we
will
as
far
as
in
us
lies
neglect
nothing
appertaining
to
our
duty
and
his
service
it
is
true
that
we
can
not
service
to
him
for
he
has
need
of
nothing
but
it
is
him
in
our
parlance
when
we
strive
to
carry
out
his
presumptive
will
in
the
good
as
it
is
known
to
us
wherever
we
can
contribute
thereto
for
we
must
always
presume
that
god
is
prompted
towards
the
good
we
know
until
the
event
shows
us
that
he
had
stronger
reasons
although
perhaps
unknown
to
us
which
have
made
him
subordinate
this
good
that
we
sought
to
some
other
greater
good
of
his
own
designing
which
he
has
not
failed
or
will
not
fail
to
effect
i
have
just
shown
how
the
action
of
the
will
depends
upon
its
causes
that
there
is
nothing
so
appropriate
to
human
nature
as
this
dependence
of
our
actions
and
that
otherwise
one
would
slip
into
a
preposterous
and
unendurable
fatality
namely
into
the
which
is
the
worst
of
all
because
it
overthrows
foresight
and
good
counsel
it
is
well
to
show
notwithstanding
how
this
dependence
of
voluntary
actions
does
not
fundamentally
preclude
the
existence
within
us
of
a
wonderful
which
in
a
certain
sense
makes
the
soul
in
its
resolves
independent
of
the
physical
influence
of
all
other
creatures
this
spontaneity
hitherto
little
recognized
which
exalts
our
command
over
our
actions
to
the
highest
pitch
is
a
consequence
of
the
system
of
harmony
of
which
i
must
give
some
explanation
here
the
scholastic
philosophers
believed
that
there
was
a
reciprocal
physical
influence
between
body
and
soul
but
since
it
has
been
recognized
that
thought
and
dimensional
mass
have
no
mutual
connexion
and
that
they
are
creatures
differing
many
moderns
have
acknowledged
that
there
is
no
between
soul
and
body
despite
the
always
subsisting
which
causes
soul
and
body
to
compose
one
and
the
same
or
what
is
called
a
person
this
physical
communication
if
there
were
such
would
cause
the
soul
to
change
the
degree
of
speed
and
the
directional
line
of
some
motions
that
are
in
the
body
and
the
body
to
change
the
sequence
of
the
thoughts
that
are
in
the
soul
but
this
effect
can
not
be
inferred
from
any
notion
conceived
in
the
body
and
in
the
soul
though
nothing
be
better
known
to
us
than
the
soul
since
it
is
inmost
to
us
that
is
to
say
inmost
to
itself
descartes
wished
to
compromise
and
to
make
a
part
of
the
action
dependent
upon
the
soul
he
believed
in
the
existence
of
a
rule
of
nature
to
the
effect
according
to
him
that
the
same
quantity
of
movement
is
conserved
in
bodies
he
deemed
it
not
possible
that
the
influence
of
the
soul
should
violate
this
law
of
bodies
but
he
believed
that
the
soul
notwithstanding
might
have
power
to
change
the
direction
of
the
movements
that
are
made
in
the
body
much
as
a
rider
though
giving
no
force
to
the
horse
he
mounts
nevertheless
controls
it
by
guiding
that
force
in
any
direction
he
pleases
but
as
that
is
done
by
means
of
the
bridle
the
bit
the
spurs
and
other
material
aids
it
is
conceivable
how
that
can
be
there
are
however
no
instruments
such
as
the
soul
may
employ
for
this
result
nothing
indeed
either
in
the
soul
or
in
the
body
that
is
either
in
thought
or
in
the
mass
which
may
serve
to
explain
this
change
of
the
one
by
the
other
in
a
word
that
the
soul
should
change
the
quantity
of
force
and
that
it
should
change
the
line
of
direction
both
these
things
are
equally
inexplicable
moreover
two
important
truths
on
this
subject
have
been
discovered
since
descartes
day
the
first
is
that
the
quantity
of
absolute
force
which
is
in
fact
conserved
is
different
from
the
quantity
of
movement
as
i
have
demonstrated
elsewhere
the
second
discovery
is
that
the
same
direction
is
still
conserved
in
all
bodies
together
that
are
assumed
as
interacting
in
whatever
way
they
come
into
collision
if
this
rule
had
been
known
to
descartes
he
would
have
taken
the
direction
of
bodies
to
be
as
independent
of
the
soul
as
their
force
and
i
believe
that
that
would
have
led
direct
to
the
hypothesis
of
harmony
whither
these
same
rules
have
led
me
for
apart
from
the
fact
that
the
physical
influence
of
one
of
these
substances
on
the
other
is
inexplicable
i
recognized
that
without
a
complete
derangement
of
the
laws
of
nature
the
soul
could
not
act
physically
upon
the
body
and
i
did
not
believe
that
one
could
here
listen
to
philosophers
competent
in
other
respects
who
produce
a
god
as
it
were
to
bring
about
the
final
solution
of
the
piece
maintaining
that
god
exerts
himself
deliberately
to
move
bodies
as
the
soul
pleases
and
to
give
perceptions
to
the
soul
as
the
body
requires
for
this
system
which
is
called
that
of
because
it
teaches
that
god
acts
on
the
body
at
the
instance
of
the
soul
and
besides
introducing
perpetual
miracles
to
establish
communication
between
these
two
substances
does
not
obviate
the
derangement
of
the
natural
laws
obtaining
in
each
of
these
same
substances
which
in
the
general
opinion
their
mutual
influence
would
cause
being
on
other
considerations
already
convinced
of
the
principle
of
harmony
in
general
i
was
in
consequence
convinced
likewise
of
the
and
the
harmony
of
all
things
amongst
themselves
of
that
between
nature
and
grace
between
the
decrees
of
god
and
our
actions
foreseen
between
all
parts
of
matter
and
even
between
the
future
and
the
past
the
whole
in
conformity
with
the
sovereign
wisdom
of
god
whose
works
are
the
most
harmonious
it
is
possible
to
conceive
thus
i
could
not
fail
to
arrive
at
the
system
which
declares
that
god
created
the
soul
in
the
beginning
in
such
a
fashion
that
it
must
produce
and
represent
to
itself
successively
that
which
takes
place
within
the
body
and
the
body
also
in
such
a
fashion
that
it
must
do
of
itself
that
which
the
soul
ordains
consequently
the
laws
that
connect
the
thoughts
of
the
soul
in
the
order
of
final
causes
and
in
accordance
with
the
evolution
of
perceptions
must
produce
pictures
that
meet
and
harmonize
with
the
impressions
of
bodies
on
our
organs
and
likewise
the
laws
of
movements
in
the
body
which
follow
one
another
in
the
order
of
efficient
causes
meet
and
so
harmonize
with
the
thoughts
of
the
soul
that
the
body
is
induced
to
act
at
the
time
when
the
soul
wills
it
far
from
its
being
prejudicial
nothing
can
be
more
favourable
to
freedom
than
that
system
and
jacquelot
has
demonstrated
well
in
his
book
on
the
of
faith
with
that
it
is
just
as
if
he
who
knows
all
that
i
shall
order
a
servant
to
do
the
whole
day
long
on
the
morrow
made
an
automaton
entirely
resembling
this
servant
to
carry
out
at
the
right
moment
all
that
i
should
order
and
yet
that
would
not
prevent
me
from
ordering
freely
all
that
i
should
please
although
the
action
of
the
automaton
that
would
serve
me
would
not
be
in
the
least
free
moreover
since
all
that
passes
in
the
soul
depends
according
to
this
system
only
upon
the
soul
and
its
subsequent
state
is
derived
only
from
it
and
from
its
present
state
how
can
one
give
it
a
greater
it
is
true
that
there
still
remains
some
imperfection
in
the
constitution
of
the
soul
all
that
happens
to
the
soul
depends
upon
it
but
depends
not
always
upon
its
will
that
were
too
much
nor
are
such
happenings
even
recognized
always
by
its
understanding
or
perceived
with
distinctness
for
there
is
in
the
soul
not
only
an
order
of
distinct
perceptions
forming
its
dominion
but
also
a
series
of
confused
perceptions
or
passions
forming
its
bondage
and
there
is
no
need
for
astonishment
at
that
the
soul
would
be
a
divinity
if
it
had
none
but
distinct
perceptions
it
has
nevertheless
some
power
over
these
confused
perceptions
also
even
if
in
an
indirect
manner
for
although
it
can
not
change
its
passions
forthwith
it
can
work
from
afar
towards
that
end
with
enough
success
and
endue
itself
with
new
passions
and
even
habits
it
even
has
a
like
power
over
the
more
distinct
perceptions
being
able
to
endue
itself
indirectly
with
opinions
and
intentions
and
to
hinder
itself
from
having
this
one
or
that
and
stay
or
hasten
its
judgement
for
we
can
seek
means
beforehand
to
arrest
ourselves
when
occasion
arises
on
the
sliding
step
of
a
rash
judgement
we
can
find
some
incident
to
justify
postponement
of
our
resolution
even
at
the
moment
when
the
matter
appears
ready
to
be
judged
although
our
opinion
and
our
act
of
willing
be
not
directly
objects
of
our
will
as
i
have
already
observed
one
sometimes
takes
measures
nevertheless
to
will
and
even
to
believe
in
due
time
that
which
one
does
not
will
or
believe
now
so
great
is
the
profundity
of
the
spirit
of
man
and
now
to
bring
to
a
conclusion
this
question
of
it
must
be
said
that
on
a
rigorous
definition
the
soul
has
within
it
the
principle
of
all
its
actions
and
even
of
all
its
passions
and
that
the
same
is
true
in
all
the
simple
substances
scattered
throughout
nature
although
there
be
freedom
only
in
those
that
are
intelligent
in
the
popular
sense
notwithstanding
speaking
in
accordance
with
appearances
we
must
say
that
the
soul
depends
in
some
way
upon
the
body
and
upon
the
impressions
of
the
senses
much
as
we
speak
with
ptolemy
and
tycho
in
everyday
converse
and
think
with
copernicus
when
it
is
a
question
of
the
rising
and
the
setting
of
the
sun
one
may
however
give
a
true
and
philosophic
sense
to
this
which
we
suppose
between
the
soul
and
the
body
it
is
that
the
one
of
these
two
substances
depends
upon
the
other
ideally
in
so
far
as
the
reason
of
that
which
is
done
in
the
one
can
be
furnished
by
that
which
is
in
the
other
this
had
already
happened
when
god
ordered
beforehand
the
harmony
that
there
would
be
between
them
even
so
would
that
automaton
that
should
fulfil
the
servant
function
depend
upon
me
in
virtue
of
the
knowledge
of
him
who
foreseeing
my
future
orders
would
have
rendered
it
capable
of
serving
me
at
the
right
moment
all
through
the
morrow
the
knowledge
of
my
future
intentions
would
have
actuated
this
great
craftsman
who
would
accordingly
have
fashioned
the
automaton
my
influence
would
be
objective
and
his
physical
for
in
so
far
as
the
soul
has
perfection
and
distinct
thoughts
god
has
accommodated
the
body
to
the
soul
and
has
arranged
beforehand
that
the
body
is
impelled
to
execute
its
orders
and
in
so
far
as
the
soul
is
imperfect
and
as
its
perceptions
are
confused
god
has
accommodated
the
soul
to
the
body
in
such
sort
that
the
soul
is
swayed
by
the
passions
arising
out
of
corporeal
representations
this
produces
the
same
effect
and
the
same
appearance
as
if
the
one
depended
immediately
upon
the
other
and
by
the
agency
of
a
physical
influence
properly
speaking
it
is
by
its
confused
thoughts
that
the
soul
represents
the
bodies
which
encompass
it
the
same
thing
must
apply
to
all
that
we
understand
by
the
actions
of
simple
substances
one
upon
another
for
each
one
is
assumed
to
act
upon
the
other
in
proportion
to
its
perfection
although
this
be
only
ideally
and
in
the
reasons
of
things
as
god
in
the
beginning
ordered
one
substance
to
accord
with
another
in
proportion
to
the
perfection
or
imperfection
that
there
is
in
each
withal
action
and
passion
are
always
reciprocal
in
creatures
because
one
part
of
the
reasons
which
serve
to
explain
clearly
what
is
done
and
which
have
served
to
bring
it
into
existence
is
in
the
one
of
these
substances
and
another
part
of
these
reasons
is
in
the
other
perfections
and
imperfections
being
always
mingled
and
shared
thus
it
is
we
attribute
to
the
one
and
to
the
other
but
after
all
whatsoever
dependence
be
conceived
in
voluntary
actions
and
even
though
there
were
an
absolute
and
mathematical
necessity
which
there
is
not
it
would
not
follow
that
there
would
not
be
a
sufficient
degree
of
freedom
to
render
rewards
and
punishments
just
and
reasonable
it
is
true
that
generally
we
speak
as
though
the
necessity
of
the
action
put
an
end
to
all
merit
and
all
demerit
all
justification
for
praise
and
blame
for
reward
and
punishment
but
it
must
be
admitted
that
this
conclusion
is
not
entirely
correct
i
am
very
far
from
sharing
the
opinions
of
bradwardine
wyclif
hobbes
and
spinoza
who
advocate
so
it
seems
this
entirely
mathematical
necessity
which
i
think
i
have
adequately
refuted
and
perhaps
more
clearly
than
is
customary
yet
one
must
always
bear
testimony
to
the
truth
and
not
impute
to
a
dogma
anything
that
does
not
result
from
it
moreover
these
arguments
prove
too
much
since
they
would
prove
just
as
much
against
hypothetical
necessity
and
would
justify
the
lazy
sophism
for
the
absolute
necessity
of
the
sequence
of
causes
would
in
this
matter
add
nothing
to
the
infallible
certainty
of
a
hypothetical
necessity
in
the
first
place
therefore
it
must
be
agreed
that
it
is
permitted
to
kill
a
madman
when
one
can
not
by
other
means
defend
oneself
it
will
be
granted
also
that
it
is
permitted
and
often
even
necessary
to
destroy
venomous
or
very
noxious
animals
although
they
be
not
so
by
their
own
fault
secondly
one
inflicts
punishments
upon
a
beast
despite
its
lack
of
reason
and
freedom
when
one
deems
that
this
may
serve
to
correct
it
thus
one
punishes
dogs
and
horses
and
indeed
with
much
success
rewards
serve
us
no
less
in
the
managing
of
animals
when
an
animal
is
hungry
the
food
that
is
given
to
him
causes
him
to
do
what
otherwise
would
never
be
obtained
from
him
thirdly
one
would
inflict
even
on
beasts
capital
punishments
where
it
is
no
longer
a
question
of
correcting
the
beast
that
is
punished
if
this
punishment
could
serve
as
an
example
or
inspire
terror
in
others
to
make
them
cease
from
evil
doing
rorarius
in
his
book
on
reason
in
beasts
says
that
in
africa
they
crucified
lions
in
order
to
drive
away
other
lions
from
the
towns
and
frequented
places
and
that
he
had
observed
in
passing
through
the
province
of
jülich
that
they
hanged
wolves
there
in
order
to
ensure
greater
safety
for
the
sheepfolds
there
are
people
in
the
villages
also
who
nail
birds
of
prey
to
the
doors
of
houses
with
the
idea
that
other
birds
of
the
same
kind
will
then
not
so
readily
appear
these
measures
would
always
be
justified
if
they
were
of
any
avail
then
in
the
fourth
place
since
experience
proves
that
the
fear
of
chastisements
and
the
hope
of
rewards
serves
to
make
men
abstain
from
evil
and
strive
to
do
good
one
would
have
good
reason
to
avail
oneself
of
such
even
though
men
were
acting
under
necessity
whatever
the
necessity
might
be
the
objection
will
be
raised
that
if
good
or
evil
is
necessary
it
is
useless
to
avail
oneself
of
means
to
obtain
it
or
to
hinder
it
but
the
answer
has
already
been
given
above
in
the
passage
combating
the
lazy
sophism
if
good
or
evil
were
a
necessity
without
these
means
then
such
means
would
be
unavailing
but
it
is
not
so
these
goods
and
evils
come
only
with
the
aid
of
these
means
and
if
these
results
were
necessary
the
means
would
be
a
part
of
the
causes
rendering
them
necessary
since
experience
teaches
us
that
often
fear
or
hope
hinders
evil
or
advances
good
this
objection
then
differs
hardly
at
all
from
the
lazy
sophism
which
we
raise
against
the
certainty
as
well
as
the
necessity
of
future
events
thus
one
may
say
that
these
objections
are
directed
equally
against
hypothetical
necessity
and
absolute
necessity
and
that
they
prove
as
much
against
the
one
as
against
the
other
that
is
to
say
nothing
at
all
there
was
a
great
dispute
between
bishop
bramhall
and
hobbes
which
began
when
they
were
both
in
paris
and
which
was
continued
after
their
return
to
england
all
the
parts
of
it
are
to
be
found
collected
in
a
quarto
volume
published
in
london
in
the
year
they
are
all
in
english
and
have
not
been
translated
as
far
as
i
know
nor
inserted
in
the
collection
of
works
in
latin
by
hobbes
i
had
already
read
these
writings
and
have
obtained
them
again
since
and
i
had
observed
at
the
outset
that
he
had
not
at
all
proved
the
absolute
necessity
of
all
things
but
had
shown
sufficiently
that
necessity
would
not
overthrow
all
the
rules
of
divine
or
human
justice
and
would
not
prevent
altogether
the
exercise
of
this
virtue
there
is
however
a
kind
of
justice
and
a
certain
sort
of
rewards
and
of
punishments
which
appear
not
so
applicable
to
those
who
should
act
by
an
absolute
necessity
supposing
such
necessity
existed
it
is
that
kind
of
justice
which
has
for
its
goal
neither
improvement
nor
example
nor
even
redress
of
the
evil
this
justice
has
its
foundation
only
in
the
fitness
of
things
which
demands
a
certain
satisfaction
for
the
expiation
of
an
evil
action
the
socinians
hobbes
and
some
others
do
not
admit
this
punitive
justice
which
properly
speaking
is
avenging
justice
god
reserves
it
for
himself
in
many
cases
but
he
does
not
fail
to
grant
it
to
those
who
are
entitled
to
govern
others
and
he
exercises
it
through
their
agency
provided
that
they
act
under
the
influence
of
reason
and
not
of
passion
the
socinians
believe
it
to
be
without
foundation
but
it
always
has
some
foundation
in
that
fitness
of
things
which
gives
satisfaction
not
only
to
the
injured
but
also
to
the
wise
who
see
it
even
as
a
beautiful
piece
of
music
or
again
a
good
piece
of
architecture
satisfies
cultivated
minds
and
the
wise
lawgiver
having
threatened
and
having
so
to
speak
promised
a
chastisement
it
befits
his
consistency
not
to
leave
the
action
completely
unpunished
even
though
the
punishment
would
no
longer
avail
to
correct
anyone
but
even
though
he
should
have
promised
nothing
it
is
enough
that
there
is
a
fitness
of
things
which
could
have
prompted
him
to
make
this
promise
since
the
wise
man
likewise
promises
only
that
which
is
fitting
and
one
may
even
say
that
there
is
here
a
certain
compensation
of
the
mind
which
would
be
scandalized
by
disorder
if
the
chastisement
did
not
contribute
towards
restoring
order
one
can
also
consult
what
grotius
wrote
against
the
socinians
of
the
satisfaction
of
jesus
christ
and
the
answer
of
crellius
thereto
thus
it
is
that
the
pains
of
the
damned
continue
even
when
they
no
longer
serve
to
turn
them
away
from
evil
and
that
likewise
the
rewards
of
the
blessed
continue
even
when
they
no
longer
serve
for
strengthening
them
in
good
one
may
say
nevertheless
that
the
damned
ever
bring
upon
themselves
new
pains
through
new
sins
and
that
the
blessed
ever
bring
upon
themselves
new
joys
by
new
progress
in
goodness
for
both
are
founded
on
the
of
the
fitness
of
which
has
seen
to
it
that
affairs
were
so
ordered
that
the
evil
action
must
bring
upon
itself
a
chastisement
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
following
the
parallelism
of
the
two
realms
that
of
final
causes
and
that
of
efficient
causes
that
god
has
established
in
the
universe
a
connexion
between
punishment
or
reward
and
bad
or
good
action
in
accordance
wherewith
the
first
should
always
be
attracted
by
the
second
and
virtue
and
vice
obtain
their
reward
and
their
punishment
in
consequence
of
the
natural
sequence
of
things
which
contains
still
another
kind
of
harmony
than
that
which
appears
in
the
communication
between
the
soul
and
the
body
for
in
a
word
all
that
god
does
as
i
have
said
already
is
harmonious
to
perfection
perhaps
then
this
principle
of
the
fitness
of
things
would
no
longer
apply
to
beings
acting
without
true
freedom
or
exemption
from
absolute
necessity
and
in
that
case
corrective
justice
alone
would
be
administered
and
not
punitive
justice
that
is
the
opinion
of
the
famous
conringius
in
a
dissertation
he
published
on
what
is
just
and
indeed
the
reasons
pomponazzi
employed
in
his
book
on
fate
to
prove
the
usefulness
of
chastisements
and
rewards
even
though
all
should
come
about
in
our
actions
by
a
fatal
necessity
concern
only
amendment
and
not
satisfaction
greek
kolasin
ou
timôrian
moreover
it
is
only
for
the
sake
of
outward
appearances
that
one
destroys
animals
accessary
to
certain
crimes
as
one
razes
the
houses
of
rebels
that
is
to
inspire
terror
thus
it
is
an
act
of
corrective
justice
wherein
punitive
justice
has
no
part
at
all
but
we
will
not
amuse
ourselves
now
by
discussing
a
question
more
curious
than
necessary
since
we
have
shown
sufficiently
that
there
is
no
such
necessity
in
voluntary
actions
nevertheless
it
was
well
to
show
that
alone
that
is
freedom
which
is
exempt
only
from
constraint
would
suffice
as
foundation
for
chastisements
and
rewards
of
the
kind
conducive
to
the
avoidance
of
evil
and
to
amendment
one
sees
also
from
this
that
some
persons
of
intelligence
who
persuade
themselves
that
everything
is
necessary
are
wrong
in
saying
that
none
must
be
praised
or
blamed
rewarded
or
punished
apparently
they
say
so
only
to
exercise
their
wit
the
pretext
is
that
all
being
necessary
nothing
would
be
in
our
power
but
this
pretext
is
ill
founded
necessary
actions
would
be
still
in
our
power
at
least
in
so
far
as
we
could
perform
them
or
omit
them
when
the
hope
or
the
fear
of
praise
or
blame
of
pleasure
or
pain
prompted
our
will
thereto
whether
they
prompted
it
of
necessity
or
in
prompting
it
they
left
spontaneity
contingency
and
freedom
all
alike
unimpaired
thus
praise
and
blame
rewards
and
punishments
would
preserve
always
a
large
part
of
their
use
even
though
there
were
a
true
necessity
in
our
actions
we
can
praise
and
blame
also
natural
good
and
bad
qualities
where
the
will
has
no
part
in
a
horse
in
a
diamond
in
a
man
and
he
who
said
of
cato
of
utica
that
he
acted
virtuously
through
the
goodness
of
his
nature
and
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
behave
otherwise
thought
to
praise
him
the
more
the
difficulties
which
i
have
endeavoured
up
to
now
to
remove
have
been
almost
all
common
to
natural
and
revealed
theology
now
it
will
be
necessary
to
come
to
a
question
of
revealed
theology
concerning
the
election
or
the
reprobation
of
men
with
the
dispensation
or
use
of
divine
grace
in
connexion
with
these
acts
of
the
mercy
or
the
justice
of
god
but
when
i
answered
the
preceding
objections
i
opened
up
a
way
to
meet
those
that
remain
this
confirms
the
observation
i
made
thereon
dissertation
that
there
is
rather
a
conflict
between
the
true
reasons
of
natural
theology
and
the
false
reasons
of
human
appearances
than
between
revealed
faith
and
reason
for
on
this
subject
scarcely
any
difficulty
arises
that
is
new
and
not
deriving
its
origin
from
those
which
can
be
placed
in
the
way
of
the
truths
discerned
by
reason
now
as
theologians
of
all
parties
are
divided
among
themselves
on
this
subject
of
predestination
and
grace
and
often
give
different
answers
to
the
same
objections
according
to
their
various
principles
one
can
not
avoid
touching
on
the
differences
which
prevail
among
them
one
may
say
in
general
that
some
look
upon
god
more
metaphysically
and
others
more
morally
and
it
has
already
been
stated
on
other
occasions
that
the
took
the
first
course
and
the
remonstrants
the
second
but
to
act
rightly
we
must
affirm
alike
on
one
side
the
independence
of
god
and
the
dependence
of
creatures
and
on
the
other
side
the
justice
and
goodness
of
god
which
makes
him
dependent
upon
himself
his
will
upon
his
understanding
or
his
wisdom
some
gifted
and
authors
desiring
to
show
the
force
of
the
reasons
advocated
by
the
two
principal
parties
in
order
to
persuade
them
to
a
mutual
tolerance
deem
that
the
whole
controversy
is
reduced
to
this
essential
point
namely
what
was
god
principal
aim
in
making
his
decrees
with
regard
to
man
did
he
make
them
solely
in
order
to
show
forth
his
glory
by
manifesting
his
attributes
and
forming
to
that
end
the
great
plan
of
creation
and
providence
or
has
he
had
regard
rather
to
the
voluntary
movements
of
intelligent
substances
which
he
designed
to
create
considering
what
they
would
will
and
do
in
the
different
circumstances
and
situations
wherein
he
might
place
them
so
as
to
form
a
fitting
resolve
thereupon
it
appears
to
me
that
the
two
answers
to
this
great
question
thus
given
as
opposites
to
one
another
are
easy
to
reconcile
and
that
in
consequence
the
two
parties
would
be
agreed
in
principle
without
any
need
of
tolerance
if
all
were
reduced
to
this
point
in
truth
god
in
designing
to
create
the
world
purposed
solely
to
manifest
and
communicate
his
perfections
in
the
way
that
was
most
efficacious
and
most
worthy
of
his
greatness
his
wisdom
and
his
goodness
but
that
very
purpose
pledged
him
to
consider
all
the
actions
of
creatures
while
still
in
the
state
of
pure
possibility
that
he
might
form
the
most
fitting
plan
he
is
like
a
great
architect
whose
aim
in
view
is
the
satisfaction
or
the
glory
of
having
built
a
beautiful
palace
and
who
considers
all
that
is
to
enter
into
this
construction
the
form
and
the
materials
the
place
the
situation
the
means
the
workmen
the
expense
before
he
forms
a
complete
resolve
for
a
wise
person
in
laying
his
plans
can
not
separate
the
end
from
the
means
he
does
not
contemplate
any
end
without
knowing
if
there
are
means
of
attaining
thereto
i
know
not
whether
there
are
also
perchance
persons
who
imagine
that
god
being
the
absolute
master
of
all
things
one
can
thence
infer
that
everything
outside
him
is
indifferent
to
him
that
he
considers
himself
alone
without
concern
for
others
and
that
thus
he
has
made
some
happy
and
others
unhappy
without
any
cause
without
choice
without
reason
but
to
teach
so
about
god
were
to
deprive
him
of
wisdom
and
of
goodness
we
need
only
observe
that
he
considers
himself
and
neglects
nothing
of
what
he
owes
to
himself
to
conclude
that
he
considers
his
creatures
also
and
that
he
uses
them
in
the
manner
most
consistent
with
order
for
the
more
a
great
and
good
prince
is
mindful
of
his
glory
the
more
he
will
think
of
making
his
subjects
happy
even
though
he
were
the
most
absolute
of
all
monarchs
and
though
his
subjects
were
slaves
from
birth
bondsmen
in
parlance
people
entirely
in
subjection
to
arbitrary
power
calvin
himself
and
some
others
of
the
greatest
defenders
of
the
absolute
decree
rightly
maintained
that
god
had
and
just
for
his
election
and
the
dispensation
of
his
grace
although
these
reasons
be
unknown
to
us
in
detail
and
we
must
judge
charitably
that
the
most
rigid
predestinators
have
too
much
reason
and
too
much
piety
to
depart
from
this
opinion
there
will
therefore
be
no
argument
for
debate
on
that
point
as
i
hope
with
people
who
are
at
all
reasonable
but
there
will
always
be
argument
among
those
who
are
called
universalists
and
particularists
according
to
what
they
teach
of
the
grace
and
the
will
of
god
yet
i
am
somewhat
inclined
to
believe
that
the
heated
dispute
between
them
on
the
will
of
god
to
save
all
men
and
on
that
which
depends
upon
it
when
one
keeps
separate
the
doctrine
or
of
the
assistance
of
grace
rests
rather
in
expressions
than
in
things
for
it
is
sufficient
to
consider
that
god
as
well
as
every
wise
and
beneficent
mind
is
inclined
towards
all
possible
good
and
that
this
inclination
is
proportionate
to
the
excellence
of
the
good
moreover
this
results
if
we
take
the
matter
precisely
and
in
itself
from
an
will
as
it
is
termed
which
however
is
not
always
followed
by
its
complete
effect
because
this
wise
mind
must
have
many
other
inclinations
besides
thus
it
is
the
result
of
all
the
inclinations
together
that
makes
his
will
complete
and
decretory
as
i
have
already
explained
one
may
therefore
very
well
say
with
ancient
writers
that
god
wills
to
save
all
men
according
to
his
antecedent
will
but
not
according
to
his
consequent
will
which
never
fails
to
be
followed
by
its
effect
and
if
those
who
deny
this
universal
will
do
not
allow
that
the
antecedent
inclination
be
called
a
will
they
are
only
troubling
themselves
about
a
question
of
name
but
there
is
a
question
more
serious
in
regard
to
predestination
to
eternal
life
and
to
all
other
destination
by
god
to
wit
whether
this
destination
is
absolute
or
respective
there
is
destination
to
good
and
destination
to
evil
and
as
evil
is
moral
or
physical
theologians
of
all
parties
agree
that
there
is
no
destination
to
moral
evil
that
is
to
say
that
none
is
destined
to
sin
as
for
the
greatest
physical
evil
which
is
damnation
one
can
distinguish
between
destination
and
predestination
for
predestination
appears
to
contain
within
itself
an
absolute
destination
which
is
anterior
to
the
consideration
of
the
good
or
evil
actions
of
those
whom
it
concerns
thus
one
may
say
that
the
reprobate
are
to
be
condemned
because
they
are
known
to
be
impenitent
but
it
can
not
so
well
be
said
that
the
reprobate
are
to
damnation
for
there
is
no
reprobation
its
foundation
being
final
foreseen
impenitence
it
is
true
that
there
are
writers
who
maintain
that
god
wishing
to
manifest
his
mercy
and
his
justice
in
accordance
with
reasons
worthy
of
him
but
unknown
to
us
chose
the
elect
and
in
consequence
rejected
the
damned
prior
to
all
thought
of
sin
even
of
adam
that
after
this
resolve
he
thought
fit
to
permit
sin
in
order
to
be
able
to
exercise
these
two
virtues
and
that
he
has
bestowed
grace
in
jesus
christ
to
some
in
order
to
save
them
while
he
has
refused
it
to
others
in
order
to
be
able
to
punish
them
hence
these
writers
are
named
because
the
decree
to
punish
precedes
according
to
them
the
knowledge
of
the
future
existence
of
sin
but
the
opinion
most
common
amongst
those
who
are
called
reformed
and
one
that
is
favoured
by
the
synod
of
dordrecht
is
that
of
the
corresponding
somewhat
to
the
conception
of
augustine
for
he
asserts
that
god
having
resolved
to
permit
the
sin
of
adam
and
the
corruption
of
the
human
race
for
reasons
just
but
hidden
his
mercy
made
him
choose
some
of
the
corrupt
mass
to
be
freely
saved
by
the
merit
of
jesus
christ
and
his
justice
made
him
resolve
to
punish
the
others
by
the
damnation
that
they
deserved
that
is
why
with
the
schoolmen
only
the
saved
were
called
and
the
damned
were
called
it
must
be
admitted
that
some
infralapsarians
and
others
speak
sometimes
of
predestination
to
damnation
following
the
example
of
fulgentius
and
of
augustine
himself
but
that
signifies
the
same
as
destination
to
them
and
it
avails
nothing
to
wrangle
about
words
that
pretext
notwithstanding
was
in
time
past
used
for
maltreating
that
godescalc
who
caused
a
stir
about
the
middle
of
the
ninth
century
and
who
took
the
name
of
fulgentius
to
indicate
that
he
followed
that
author
as
for
the
destination
of
the
elect
to
eternal
life
the
protestants
as
well
as
those
of
the
roman
church
dispute
much
among
themselves
as
to
whether
election
is
absolute
or
is
founded
on
the
prevision
of
final
living
faith
those
who
are
called
evangelicals
that
is
those
of
the
augsburg
confession
hold
the
latter
opinion
they
believe
that
one
need
not
go
into
the
hidden
causes
of
election
while
one
may
find
a
manifest
cause
of
it
shown
in
holy
scripture
which
is
faith
in
jesus
christ
and
it
appears
to
them
that
the
prevision
of
the
cause
is
also
the
cause
of
the
prevision
of
the
effect
those
who
are
called
reformed
are
of
a
different
opinion
they
admit
that
salvation
comes
from
faith
in
jesus
christ
but
they
observe
that
often
the
cause
anterior
to
the
effect
in
execution
is
posterior
in
intention
as
when
the
cause
is
the
means
and
the
effect
is
the
end
thus
the
question
is
whether
faith
or
salvation
is
anterior
in
the
intention
of
god
that
is
whether
god
design
is
rather
to
save
man
than
to
make
him
a
believer
hence
we
see
that
the
question
between
the
supralapsarians
and
the
infralapsarians
in
part
and
again
between
them
and
the
evangelicals
comes
back
to
a
right
conception
of
the
order
that
is
in
god
decrees
perhaps
one
might
put
an
end
to
this
dispute
at
once
by
saying
that
properly
speaking
all
the
decrees
of
god
that
are
here
concerned
are
simultaneous
not
only
in
respect
of
time
as
everyone
agrees
but
also
signo
or
in
the
order
of
nature
and
indeed
the
formula
of
concord
building
upon
some
passages
of
augustine
comprised
in
the
same
decree
of
election
salvation
and
the
means
that
conduce
to
it
to
demonstrate
this
synchronism
of
destinations
or
of
decrees
with
which
we
are
concerned
we
must
revert
to
the
expedient
that
i
have
employed
more
than
once
which
states
that
god
before
decreeing
anything
considered
among
other
possible
sequences
of
things
that
one
which
he
afterwards
approved
in
the
idea
of
this
is
represented
how
the
first
parents
sin
and
corrupt
their
posterity
how
jesus
christ
redeems
the
human
race
how
some
aided
by
such
and
such
graces
attain
to
final
faith
and
to
salvation
and
how
others
with
or
without
such
or
other
graces
do
not
attain
thereto
continue
in
sin
and
are
damned
god
grants
his
sanction
to
this
sequence
only
after
having
entered
into
all
its
detail
and
thus
pronounces
nothing
final
as
to
those
who
shall
be
saved
or
damned
without
having
pondered
upon
everything
and
compared
it
with
other
possible
sequences
thus
pronouncement
concerns
the
whole
sequence
at
the
same
time
he
simply
decrees
its
existence
in
order
to
save
other
men
or
in
a
different
way
he
must
needs
choose
an
altogether
different
sequence
seeing
that
all
is
connected
in
each
sequence
in
this
conception
of
the
matter
which
is
that
most
worthy
of
the
all
whose
actions
are
connected
together
to
the
highest
possible
degree
there
would
be
only
one
total
decree
which
is
to
create
such
a
world
this
total
decree
comprises
equally
all
the
particular
decrees
without
setting
one
of
them
before
or
after
another
yet
one
may
say
also
that
each
particular
act
of
antecedent
will
entering
into
the
total
result
has
its
value
and
order
in
proportion
to
the
good
whereto
this
act
inclines
but
these
acts
of
antecedent
will
are
not
called
decrees
since
they
are
not
yet
inevitable
the
outcome
depending
upon
the
total
result
according
to
this
conception
of
things
all
the
difficulties
that
can
here
be
made
amount
to
the
same
as
those
i
have
already
stated
and
removed
in
my
inquiry
concerning
the
origin
of
evil
there
remains
only
one
important
matter
of
discussion
which
has
its
peculiar
difficulties
it
is
that
of
the
dispensation
of
the
means
and
circumstances
contributing
to
salvation
and
to
damnation
this
comprises
amongst
others
the
subject
of
the
aids
of
grace
auxiliis
on
which
rome
since
the
congregation
under
clement
viii
when
a
debate
took
place
between
the
dominicans
and
the
jesuits
does
not
readily
permit
books
to
be
published
everyone
must
agree
that
god
is
altogether
good
and
just
that
his
goodness
makes
him
contribute
the
least
possible
to
that
which
can
render
men
guilty
and
the
most
possible
to
that
which
serves
to
save
them
possible
i
say
subject
to
the
general
order
of
things
that
his
justice
prevents
him
from
condemning
innocent
men
and
from
leaving
good
actions
without
reward
and
that
he
even
keeps
an
exact
proportion
in
punishments
and
rewards
nevertheless
this
idea
that
one
should
have
of
the
goodness
and
the
justice
of
god
does
not
appear
enough
in
what
we
know
of
his
actions
with
regard
to
the
salvation
and
the
damnation
of
men
and
it
is
that
which
makes
difficulties
concerning
sin
and
its
remedies
the
first
difficulty
is
how
the
soul
could
be
infected
with
original
sin
which
is
the
root
of
actual
sins
without
injustice
on
god
part
in
exposing
the
soul
thereto
this
difficulty
has
given
rise
to
three
opinions
on
the
origin
of
the
soul
itself
the
first
is
that
of
the
of
human
in
another
world
or
in
another
life
where
they
had
sinned
and
on
that
account
had
been
condemned
to
this
prison
of
the
human
body
an
opinion
of
the
platonists
which
is
attributed
to
origen
and
which
even
finds
adherents
henry
more
an
english
scholar
advocated
something
like
this
dogma
in
a
book
written
with
that
express
purpose
some
of
those
who
affirm
this
have
gone
as
far
as
metempsychosis
the
younger
van
helmont
held
this
opinion
and
the
ingenious
author
of
some
metaphysical
published
in
under
the
name
of
william
wander
appears
to
have
some
leaning
towards
it
the
second
opinion
is
that
of
as
if
the
soul
of
children
were
engendered
from
the
soul
or
souls
of
those
from
whom
the
body
is
engendered
augustine
inclined
to
this
judgement
the
better
to
explain
original
sin
this
doctrine
is
taught
also
by
most
of
the
theologians
of
the
augsburg
confession
nevertheless
it
is
not
completely
established
among
them
since
the
universities
of
jena
and
helmstedt
and
others
besides
have
long
been
opposed
to
it
the
third
opinion
and
that
most
widely
accepted
is
that
of
it
is
taught
in
the
majority
of
the
christian
schools
but
it
is
fraught
with
the
greatest
difficulty
in
respect
of
original
sin
into
this
controversy
of
theologians
on
the
origin
of
the
human
soul
has
entered
the
philosophic
dispute
on
origin
of
aristotle
and
scholastic
philosophy
after
him
called
that
which
is
a
principle
of
action
and
is
found
in
that
which
acts
this
inward
principle
is
either
substantial
being
then
termed
when
it
is
in
an
organic
body
or
accidental
and
customarily
termed
the
same
philosopher
gave
to
the
soul
the
generic
name
of
or
this
word
apparently
takes
its
origin
from
the
greek
word
signifying
and
hence
the
celebrated
ermolao
barbaro
expressed
it
literally
in
latin
by
for
act
is
a
realization
of
potency
and
he
had
no
need
to
consult
the
devil
as
men
say
he
did
in
order
to
learn
that
now
the
philosopher
of
stagira
supposes
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
act
the
permanent
act
and
the
successive
act
the
permanent
or
lasting
act
is
nothing
but
the
substantial
or
accidental
form
the
substantial
form
as
for
example
the
soul
is
altogether
permanent
at
least
according
to
my
judgement
and
the
accidental
is
only
so
for
a
time
but
the
altogether
momentary
act
whose
nature
is
transitory
consists
in
action
itself
i
have
shown
elsewhere
that
the
notion
of
entelechy
is
not
altogether
to
be
scorned
and
that
being
permanent
it
carries
with
it
not
only
a
mere
faculty
for
action
but
also
that
which
is
called
from
which
action
itself
must
follow
if
nothing
prevents
it
faculty
is
only
an
or
rather
sometimes
a
mode
but
force
when
it
is
not
an
ingredient
of
substance
itself
that
is
force
which
is
not
primitive
but
derivative
is
a
which
is
distinct
and
separable
from
substance
i
have
shown
also
how
one
may
suppose
that
the
soul
is
a
primitive
force
which
is
modified
and
varied
by
derivative
forces
or
qualities
and
exercised
in
actions
now
philosophers
have
troubled
themselves
exceedingly
on
the
question
of
the
origin
of
substantial
forms
for
to
say
that
the
compound
of
form
and
matter
is
produced
and
that
the
form
is
only
means
nothing
the
common
opinion
was
that
forms
were
derived
from
the
potency
of
matter
this
being
called
that
also
meant
in
fact
nothing
but
it
was
explained
in
a
sense
by
a
comparison
with
shapes
for
that
of
a
statue
is
produced
only
by
removal
of
the
superfluous
marble
this
comparison
might
be
valid
if
form
consisted
in
a
mere
limitation
as
in
the
case
of
shape
some
have
thought
that
forms
were
sent
from
heaven
and
even
created
expressly
when
bodies
were
produced
julius
scaliger
hinted
that
it
was
possible
that
forms
were
rather
derived
from
the
active
potency
of
the
efficient
cause
that
is
to
say
either
from
that
of
god
in
the
case
of
creation
or
from
that
of
other
forms
in
the
case
of
generation
than
from
the
passive
potency
of
matter
and
that
in
the
case
of
generation
meant
a
return
to
traduction
daniel
sennert
a
famous
doctor
and
physicist
at
wittenberg
cherished
this
opinion
particularly
in
relation
to
animate
bodies
which
are
multiplied
through
seed
a
certain
julius
caesar
della
galla
an
italian
living
in
the
low
countries
and
a
doctor
of
groningen
named
johan
freitag
wrote
with
much
vehemence
in
opposition
to
sennert
johann
sperling
a
professor
at
wittenberg
made
a
defence
of
his
master
and
finally
came
into
conflict
with
johann
zeisold
a
professor
at
jena
who
upheld
the
belief
that
the
human
soul
is
created
but
traduction
and
eduction
are
equally
inexplicable
when
it
is
a
question
of
finding
the
origin
of
the
soul
it
is
not
the
same
with
accidental
forms
since
they
are
only
modifications
of
the
substance
and
their
origin
may
be
explained
by
eduction
that
is
by
variation
of
limitations
in
the
same
way
as
the
origin
of
shapes
but
it
is
quite
another
matter
when
we
are
concerned
with
the
origin
of
a
substance
whose
beginning
and
destruction
are
equally
difficult
to
explain
sennert
and
sperling
did
not
venture
to
admit
the
subsistence
and
the
indestructibility
of
the
souls
of
beasts
or
of
other
primitive
forms
although
they
allowed
that
they
were
indivisible
and
immaterial
but
the
fact
is
that
they
confused
indestructibility
with
immortality
whereby
is
understood
in
the
case
of
man
that
not
only
the
soul
but
also
the
personality
subsists
in
saying
that
the
soul
of
man
is
immortal
one
implies
the
subsistence
of
what
makes
the
identity
of
the
person
something
which
retains
its
moral
qualities
conserving
the
or
the
reflective
inward
feeling
of
what
it
is
thus
it
is
rendered
susceptible
to
chastisement
or
reward
but
this
conservation
of
personality
does
not
occur
in
the
souls
of
beasts
that
is
why
i
prefer
to
say
that
they
are
imperishable
rather
than
to
call
them
immortal
yet
this
misapprehension
appears
to
have
been
the
cause
of
a
great
inconsistency
in
the
doctrine
of
the
thomists
and
of
other
good
philosophers
they
recognized
the
immateriality
or
indivisibility
of
all
souls
without
being
willing
to
admit
their
indestructibility
greatly
to
the
prejudice
of
the
immortality
of
the
human
soul
john
scot
that
is
the
scotsman
which
formerly
signified
hibernian
or
erigena
a
famous
writer
of
the
time
of
louis
the
debonair
and
of
his
sons
was
for
the
conservation
of
all
souls
and
i
see
not
why
there
should
be
less
objection
to
making
the
atoms
of
epicurus
or
of
gassendi
endure
than
to
affirming
the
subsistence
of
all
truly
simple
and
indivisible
substances
which
are
the
sole
and
true
atoms
of
nature
and
pythagoras
was
right
in
saying
generally
as
ovid
makes
him
say
carent
now
as
i
like
maxims
which
hold
good
and
admit
of
the
fewest
exceptions
possible
here
is
what
has
appeared
to
me
most
reasonable
in
every
sense
on
this
important
question
i
consider
that
souls
and
simple
substances
altogether
can
not
begin
except
by
creation
or
end
except
by
annihilation
moreover
as
the
formation
of
organic
animate
bodies
appears
explicable
in
the
order
of
nature
only
when
one
assumes
a
already
organic
i
have
thence
inferred
that
what
we
call
generation
of
an
animal
is
only
a
transformation
and
augmentation
thus
since
the
same
body
was
already
furnished
with
organs
it
is
to
be
supposed
that
it
was
already
animate
and
that
it
had
the
same
soul
so
i
assume
from
the
conservation
of
the
soul
when
once
it
is
created
that
the
animal
is
also
conserved
and
that
apparent
death
is
only
an
envelopment
there
being
no
likelihood
that
in
the
order
of
nature
souls
exist
entirely
separated
from
all
body
or
that
what
does
not
begin
naturally
can
cease
through
natural
forces
considering
that
so
admirable
an
order
and
rules
so
general
are
established
in
regard
to
animals
it
does
not
appear
reasonable
that
man
should
be
completely
excluded
from
that
order
and
that
everything
in
relation
to
his
soul
should
come
about
in
him
by
miracle
besides
i
have
pointed
out
repeatedly
that
it
is
of
the
essence
of
god
wisdom
that
all
should
be
harmonious
in
his
works
and
that
nature
should
be
parallel
with
grace
it
is
thus
my
belief
that
those
souls
which
one
day
shall
be
human
souls
like
those
of
other
species
have
been
in
the
seed
and
in
the
progenitors
as
far
back
as
adam
and
have
consequently
existed
since
the
beginning
of
things
always
in
a
kind
of
organic
body
on
this
point
it
seems
that
swammerdam
father
malebranche
bayle
pitcairne
hartsoeker
and
numerous
other
very
able
persons
share
my
opinion
this
doctrine
is
also
sufficiently
confirmed
by
the
microscope
observations
of
leeuwenhoek
and
other
good
observers
but
it
also
for
divers
reasons
appears
likely
to
me
that
they
existed
then
as
sentient
or
animal
souls
only
endowed
with
perception
and
feeling
and
devoid
of
reason
further
i
believe
that
they
remained
in
this
state
up
to
the
time
of
the
generation
of
the
man
to
whom
they
were
to
belong
but
that
then
they
received
reason
whether
there
be
a
natural
means
of
raising
a
sentient
soul
to
the
degree
of
a
reasoning
soul
a
thing
i
find
it
difficult
to
imagine
or
whether
god
may
have
given
reason
to
this
soul
through
some
special
operation
or
if
you
will
by
a
kind
of
this
latter
is
easier
to
admit
inasmuch
as
revelation
teaches
much
about
other
forms
of
immediate
operation
by
god
upon
our
souls
this
explanation
appears
to
remove
the
obstacles
that
beset
this
matter
in
philosophy
or
theology
for
the
difficulty
of
the
origin
of
forms
thus
disappears
completely
and
besides
it
is
much
more
appropriate
to
divine
justice
to
give
the
soul
already
corrupted
or
on
the
animal
side
by
the
sin
of
adam
a
new
perfection
which
is
reason
than
to
put
a
reasoning
soul
by
creation
or
otherwise
in
a
body
wherein
it
is
to
be
corrupted
now
the
soul
being
once
under
the
domination
of
sin
and
ready
to
commit
sin
in
actual
fact
as
soon
as
the
man
is
fit
to
exercise
reason
a
new
question
arises
to
wit
whether
this
tendency
in
a
man
who
has
not
been
regenerated
by
baptism
suffices
to
damn
him
even
though
he
should
never
come
to
commit
sin
as
may
happen
and
happens
often
whether
he
die
before
reaching
years
of
discretion
or
he
become
dull
of
sense
before
he
has
made
use
of
his
reason
gregory
of
nazianzos
is
supposed
to
have
denied
this
de
but
augustine
is
for
the
affirmative
and
maintains
that
original
sin
of
itself
is
sufficient
to
earn
the
flames
of
hell
although
this
opinion
is
to
say
the
least
very
harsh
when
i
speak
here
of
damnation
or
of
hell
i
mean
pains
and
not
mere
deprivation
of
supreme
felicity
i
mean
sensus
non
gregory
of
rimini
general
of
the
augustinians
with
a
few
others
followed
augustine
in
opposition
to
the
accepted
opinion
of
the
schools
of
his
time
and
for
that
reason
he
was
called
the
torturer
of
children
the
schoolmen
instead
of
sending
them
into
the
flames
of
hell
have
assigned
to
them
a
special
limbo
where
they
do
not
suffer
and
are
only
punished
by
privation
of
the
beatific
vision
the
revelations
of
birgitta
as
they
are
called
much
esteemed
in
rome
also
uphold
this
dogma
salmeron
and
molina
and
before
them
ambrose
catharin
and
others
grant
them
a
certain
natural
bliss
and
cardinal
sfondrati
a
man
of
learning
and
piety
who
approves
this
latterly
went
so
far
as
to
prefer
in
a
sense
their
state
which
is
the
state
of
happy
innocence
to
that
of
a
sinner
saved
as
we
may
see
in
his
praedestinationis
that
however
seems
to
go
too
far
certainly
a
soul
truly
enlightened
would
not
wish
to
sin
even
though
it
could
by
this
means
obtain
all
imaginable
pleasures
but
the
case
of
choosing
between
sin
and
true
bliss
is
simply
chimerical
and
it
is
better
to
obtain
bliss
even
after
repentance
than
to
be
deprived
of
it
for
ever
many
prelates
and
theologians
of
france
who
are
well
pleased
to
differ
from
molina
and
to
join
with
augustine
seem
to
incline
towards
the
opinion
of
this
great
doctor
who
condemns
to
eternal
flames
children
that
die
in
the
age
of
innocence
before
having
received
baptism
this
is
what
appears
from
the
letter
mentioned
above
written
by
five
distinguished
prelates
of
france
to
pope
innocent
xii
against
that
posthumous
book
by
cardinal
sfondrati
but
therein
they
did
not
venture
to
condemn
the
doctrine
of
the
purely
privative
punishment
of
children
dying
without
baptism
seeing
it
approved
by
the
venerable
thomas
aquinas
and
by
other
great
men
i
do
not
speak
of
those
who
are
called
on
one
side
jansenists
and
on
the
other
disciples
of
augustine
for
they
declare
themselves
entirely
and
firmly
for
the
opinion
of
this
father
but
it
must
be
confessed
that
this
opinion
has
not
sufficient
foundation
either
in
reason
or
in
scripture
and
that
it
is
outrageously
harsh
nicole
makes
rather
a
poor
apology
for
it
in
his
book
on
the
of
the
written
to
oppose
jurieu
although
bayle
takes
his
side
in
chapter
of
the
to
the
questions
of
a
vol
iii
nicole
makes
use
of
this
pretext
that
there
are
also
other
dogmas
in
the
christian
religion
which
appear
harsh
on
the
one
hand
however
that
does
not
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
these
instances
of
harshness
may
be
multiplied
without
proof
and
on
the
other
we
must
take
into
account
that
the
other
dogmas
mentioned
by
nicole
namely
original
sin
and
eternity
of
punishment
are
only
harsh
and
unjust
to
outward
appearance
while
the
damnation
of
children
dying
without
actual
sin
and
without
regeneration
would
in
truth
be
harsh
since
it
would
be
in
effect
the
damning
of
innocents
for
that
reason
i
believe
that
the
party
which
advocates
this
opinion
will
never
altogether
have
the
upper
hand
in
the
roman
church
itself
evangelical
theologians
are
accustomed
to
speak
with
fair
moderation
on
this
question
and
to
surrender
these
souls
to
the
judgement
and
the
clemency
of
their
creator
nor
do
we
know
all
the
wonderful
ways
that
god
may
choose
to
employ
for
the
illumination
of
souls
one
may
say
that
those
who
condemn
for
original
sin
alone
and
who
consequently
condemn
children
dying
unbaptized
or
outside
the
covenant
fall
in
a
sense
without
being
aware
of
it
into
a
certain
attitude
to
man
inclination
and
god
foreknowledge
which
they
disapprove
in
others
they
will
not
have
it
that
god
should
refuse
his
grace
to
those
whose
resistance
to
it
he
foresees
nor
that
this
expectation
and
this
tendency
should
cause
the
damnation
of
these
persons
and
yet
they
claim
that
the
tendency
which
constitutes
original
sin
and
in
which
god
foresees
that
the
child
will
sin
as
soon
as
he
shall
reach
years
of
discretion
suffices
to
damn
this
child
beforehand
those
who
maintain
the
one
and
reject
the
other
do
not
preserve
enough
uniformity
and
connexion
in
their
dogmas
there
is
scarcely
less
difficulty
in
the
matter
of
those
who
reach
years
of
discretion
and
plunge
into
sin
following
the
inclination
of
corrupt
nature
if
they
receive
not
the
succour
of
the
grace
necessary
for
them
to
stop
on
the
edge
of
the
precipice
or
to
drag
themselves
from
the
abyss
wherein
they
have
fallen
for
it
seems
hard
to
damn
them
eternally
for
having
done
that
which
they
had
no
power
to
prevent
themselves
from
doing
those
that
damn
even
children
who
are
without
discretion
trouble
themselves
even
less
about
adults
and
one
would
say
that
they
have
become
callous
through
the
very
expectation
of
seeing
people
suffer
but
it
is
not
the
same
with
other
theologians
and
i
would
be
rather
on
the
side
of
those
who
grant
to
all
men
a
grace
sufficient
to
draw
them
away
from
evil
provided
they
have
a
sufficient
tendency
to
profit
by
this
succour
and
not
to
reject
it
voluntarily
the
objection
is
made
that
there
has
been
and
still
is
a
countless
multitude
of
men
among
civilized
peoples
and
among
barbarians
who
have
never
had
this
knowledge
of
god
and
of
jesus
christ
which
is
necessary
for
those
who
would
tread
the
wonted
paths
to
salvation
but
without
excusing
them
on
the
plea
of
a
sin
purely
philosophical
and
without
stopping
at
a
mere
penalty
of
privation
things
for
which
there
is
no
opportunity
of
discussion
here
one
may
doubt
the
fact
for
how
do
we
know
whether
they
do
not
receive
ordinary
or
extraordinary
succour
of
kinds
unknown
to
us
this
maxim
facienti
quod
in
se
est
non
denegatur
gratia
appears
to
me
to
have
eternal
truth
thomas
aquinas
archbishop
bradwardine
and
others
have
hinted
that
in
regard
to
this
something
comes
to
pass
of
which
we
are
not
aware
thom
quest

bradwardine
causa
non
procul
ab
initio
and
sundry
theologians
of
great
authority
in
the
roman
church
itself
have
taught
that
a
sincere
act
of
the
love
of
god
above
all
things
when
the
grace
of
jesus
christ
arouses
it
suffices
for
salvation
father
francis
xavier
answered
the
japanese
that
if
their
ancestors
had
used
well
their
natural
light
god
would
have
given
them
the
grace
necessary
for
salvation
and
the
bishop
of
geneva
francis
of
sales
gives
full
approval
to
this
answer
book
the
love
of
god
ch
this
i
pointed
out
some
time
ago
to
the
excellent
m
pélisson
to
show
him
that
the
roman
church
going
further
than
the
protestants
does
not
damn
utterly
those
who
are
outside
its
communion
and
even
outside
christianity
by
using
as
its
only
criterion
explicit
faith
nor
did
he
refute
it
properly
speaking
in
the
very
kind
answer
he
gave
me
and
which
he
published
in
the
fourth
part
of
his
also
doing
me
the
honour
of
adding
to
it
my
letter
i
offered
him
then
for
consideration
what
a
famous
portuguese
theologian
by
name
jacques
payva
andradius
envoy
to
the
council
of
trent
wrote
concerning
this
in
opposition
to
chemnitz
during
this
same
council
and
now
without
citing
many
other
authors
of
eminence
i
will
content
myself
with
naming
father
friedrich
spee
the
jesuit
one
of
the
most
excellent
in
his
society
who
also
held
this
common
opinion
upon
the
efficacy
of
the
love
of
god
as
is
apparent
in
the
preface
to
the
admirable
book
which
he
wrote
in
germany
on
the
christian
virtues
he
speaks
of
this
observation
as
of
a
highly
important
secret
of
piety
and
expatiates
with
great
clearness
upon
the
power
of
divine
love
to
blot
out
sin
even
without
the
intervention
of
the
sacraments
of
the
catholic
church
provided
one
scorn
them
not
for
that
would
not
at
all
be
compatible
with
this
love
and
a
very
great
personage
whose
character
was
one
of
the
most
lofty
to
be
found
in
the
roman
church
was
the
first
to
make
me
acquainted
with
it
father
spee
was
of
a
noble
family
of
westphalia
it
may
be
said
in
passing
and
he
died
in
the
odour
of
sanctity
according
to
the
testimony
of
him
who
published
this
book
in
cologne
with
the
approval
of
the
superiors
the
memory
of
this
excellent
man
ought
to
be
still
precious
to
persons
of
knowledge
and
good
sense
because
he
is
the
author
of
the
book
entitled
criminalis
circa
processus
contra
which
has
caused
much
stir
and
has
been
translated
into
several
languages
i
learnt
from
the
grand
elector
of
mainz
johann
philipp
von
schonborn
uncle
of
his
highness
the
present
elector
who
walks
gloriously
in
the
footsteps
of
that
worthy
predecessor
the
story
that
follows
that
father
was
in
franconia
when
there
was
a
frenzy
there
for
burning
alleged
sorcerers
he
accompanied
even
to
the
pyre
many
of
them
all
of
whom
he
recognized
as
being
innocent
from
their
confessions
and
the
researches
that
he
had
made
thereon
therefore
in
spite
of
the
danger
incurred
at
that
time
by
one
telling
the
truth
in
this
matter
he
resolved
to
compile
this
work
without
however
naming
himself
it
bore
great
fruit
and
on
this
matter
converted
that
elector
at
that
time
still
a
simple
canon
and
afterwards
bishop
of
würzburg
finally
also
archbishop
of
mainz
who
as
soon
as
he
came
to
power
put
an
end
to
these
burnings
therein
he
was
followed
by
the
dukes
of
brunswick
and
finally
by
the
majority
of
the
other
princes
and
states
of
germany
this
digression
appeared
to
me
to
be
seasonable
because
that
writer
deserves
to
be
more
widely
known
returning
now
to
the
subject
i
make
a
further
observation
supposing
that
a
knowledge
of
jesus
christ
according
to
the
flesh
is
absolutely
necessary
to
salvation
as
indeed
it
is
safest
to
teach
it
will
be
possible
to
say
that
god
will
give
that
knowledge
to
all
those
who
do
humanly
speaking
that
which
in
them
lies
even
though
god
must
needs
give
it
by
a
miracle
moreover
we
can
not
know
what
passes
in
souls
at
the
point
of
death
and
if
sundry
learned
and
serious
theologians
claim
that
children
receive
in
baptism
a
kind
of
faith
although
they
do
not
remember
it
afterwards
when
they
are
questioned
about
it
why
should
one
maintain
that
nothing
of
a
like
nature
or
even
more
definite
could
come
about
in
the
dying
whom
we
can
not
interrogate
after
their
death
thus
there
are
countless
paths
open
to
god
giving
him
means
of
satisfying
his
justice
and
his
goodness
and
the
only
thing
one
may
allege
against
this
is
that
we
know
not
what
way
he
employs
which
is
far
from
being
a
valid
objection
let
us
pass
on
to
those
who
lack
not
power
to
amend
but
good
will
they
are
doubtless
not
to
be
excused
but
there
always
remains
a
great
difficulty
concerning
god
since
it
rested
with
him
to
give
them
this
same
good
will
he
is
the
master
of
wills
the
hearts
of
kings
and
those
of
all
other
men
are
in
his
hand
holy
scripture
goes
so
far
as
to
say
that
god
at
times
hardened
the
wicked
in
order
to
display
his
power
by
punishing
them
this
hardening
is
not
to
be
taken
as
meaning
that
god
inspires
men
with
a
kind
of
that
is
a
kind
of
repugnance
to
good
or
even
an
inclination
towards
evil
just
as
the
grace
that
he
gives
is
an
inclination
towards
good
it
is
rather
that
god
having
considered
the
sequence
of
things
that
he
established
found
it
fitting
for
superior
reasons
to
permit
that
pharaoh
for
example
should
be
in
such
as
should
increase
his
wickedness
and
divine
wisdom
willed
to
derive
a
good
from
this
evil
thus
it
all
often
comes
down
to
which
form
a
part
of
the
combination
of
things
there
are
countless
examples
of
small
circumstances
serving
to
convert
or
to
pervert
nothing
is
more
widely
known
than
the
take
and
read
cry
which
augustine
heard
in
a
neighbouring
house
when
he
was
pondering
on
what
side
he
should
take
among
the
christians
divided
into
sects
and
saying
to
himself
vitae
sectabor
iter
this
brought
him
to
open
at
random
the
book
of
the
holy
scriptures
which
he
had
before
him
and
to
read
what
came
before
his
eyes
and
these
were
words
which
finally
induced
him
to
give
up
manichaeism
the
good
steno
a
dane
who
was
titular
bishop
of
titianopolis
vicar
apostolic
as
they
say
of
hanover
and
the
region
around
when
there
was
a
duke
regent
of
his
religion
told
us
that
something
of
that
kind
had
happened
to
him
he
was
a
great
anatomist
and
deeply
versed
in
natural
science
but
he
unfortunately
gave
up
research
therein
and
from
being
a
great
physicist
he
became
a
mediocre
theologian
he
would
almost
listen
to
nothing
more
about
the
marvels
of
nature
and
an
express
order
from
the
pope
virtute
sanctae
was
needed
to
extract
from
him
the
observations
thévenot
asked
of
him
he
told
us
then
that
what
had
greatly
helped
towards
inducing
him
to
place
himself
on
the
side
of
the
roman
church
had
been
the
voice
of
a
lady
in
florence
who
had
cried
out
to
him
from
a
window
not
on
the
side
where
you
are
about
to
go
sir
go
on
the
other
side
voice
struck
me
he
told
us
i
was
just
meditating
upon
religion
this
lady
knew
that
he
was
seeking
a
man
in
the
house
where
she
was
and
when
she
saw
him
making
his
way
to
the
other
house
wished
to
point
out
where
his
friend
room
was
father
john
davidius
the
jesuit
wrote
a
book
entitled
which
is
like
a
kind
of
where
one
takes
passages
at
random
after
the
pattern
of
the
of
augustine
and
it
is
like
a
devotional
game
but
the
chances
to
which
in
spite
of
ourselves
we
are
subject
play
only
too
large
a
part
in
what
brings
salvation
to
men
or
removes
it
from
them
let
us
imagine
twin
polish
children
the
one
taken
by
the
tartars
sold
to
the
turks
brought
to
apostasy
plunged
in
impiety
dying
in
despair
the
other
saved
by
some
chance
falling
then
into
good
hands
to
be
educated
properly
permeated
by
the
soundest
truths
of
religion
exercised
in
the
virtues
that
it
commends
to
us
dying
with
all
the
feelings
of
a
good
christian
one
will
lament
the
misfortune
of
the
former
prevented
perhaps
by
a
slight
circumstance
from
being
saved
like
his
brother
and
one
will
marvel
that
this
slight
chance
should
have
decided
his
fate
for
eternity
someone
will
perchance
say
that
god
foresaw
by
mediate
knowledge
that
the
former
would
have
been
wicked
and
damned
even
if
he
had
remained
in
poland
there
are
perhaps
conjunctures
wherein
something
of
the
kind
takes
place
but
will
it
therefore
be
said
that
this
is
a
general
rule
and
that
not
one
of
those
who
were
damned
amongst
the
pagans
would
have
been
saved
if
he
had
been
amongst
christians
would
that
not
be
to
contradict
our
lord
who
said
that
tyre
and
sidon
would
have
profited
better
by
his
preaching
if
they
had
had
the
good
fortune
to
hear
it
than
capernaum
but
were
one
to
admit
even
here
this
use
of
mediate
knowledge
against
all
appearances
this
knowledge
still
implies
that
god
considers
what
a
man
would
do
in
such
and
such
circumstances
and
it
always
remains
true
that
god
could
have
placed
him
in
other
circumstances
more
favourable
and
given
him
inward
or
outward
succour
capable
of
vanquishing
the
most
abysmal
wickedness
existing
in
any
soul
i
shall
be
told
that
god
is
not
bound
to
do
so
but
that
is
not
enough
it
must
be
added
that
greater
reasons
prevent
him
from
making
all
his
goodness
felt
by
all
thus
there
must
needs
be
choice
but
i
do
not
think
one
must
seek
the
reason
altogether
in
the
good
or
bad
nature
of
men
for
if
with
some
people
one
assume
that
god
choosing
the
plan
which
produces
the
most
good
but
which
involves
sin
and
damnation
has
been
prompted
by
his
wisdom
to
choose
the
best
natures
in
order
to
make
them
objects
of
his
grace
this
grace
would
not
sufficiently
appear
to
be
a
free
gift
accordingly
man
will
be
distinguishable
by
a
kind
of
inborn
merit
and
this
assumption
seems
remote
from
the
principles
of
paul
and
even
from
those
of
supreme
reason
it
is
true
that
there
are
reasons
for
god
choice
and
the
consideration
of
the
object
that
is
the
nature
of
man
must
needs
enter
therein
but
it
does
not
seem
that
this
choice
can
be
subjected
to
a
rule
such
as
we
are
capable
of
conceiving
and
such
as
may
flatter
the
pride
of
men
some
famous
theologians
believe
that
god
offers
more
grace
and
in
a
more
favourable
way
to
those
whose
resistance
he
foresees
will
be
less
and
that
he
abandons
the
rest
to
their
we
may
readily
suppose
that
this
is
often
the
case
and
this
expedient
among
those
which
make
man
distinguishable
by
anything
favourable
in
his
nature
is
the
farthest
removed
from
pelagianism
but
i
would
not
venture
notwithstanding
to
make
of
it
a
universal
rule
moreover
that
we
may
not
have
cause
to
vaunt
ourselves
it
is
necessary
that
we
be
ignorant
of
the
reasons
for
choice
those
reasons
are
too
diverse
to
become
known
to
us
and
it
may
be
that
god
at
times
shows
the
power
of
his
grace
by
overcoming
the
most
obstinate
resistance
to
the
end
that
none
may
have
cause
either
to
despair
or
to
be
puffed
up
paul
as
it
would
seem
had
this
in
mind
when
he
offered
himself
as
an
example
god
he
said
has
had
mercy
upon
me
to
give
a
great
example
of
his
patience
it
may
be
that
fundamentally
all
men
are
equally
bad
and
consequently
incapable
of
being
distinguished
the
one
from
the
other
through
their
good
or
less
bad
natural
qualities
but
they
are
not
bad
all
in
the
same
way
for
there
is
an
inherent
individual
difference
between
souls
as
the
harmony
proves
some
are
more
or
less
inclined
towards
a
particular
good
or
a
particular
evil
or
towards
their
opposites
all
in
accordance
with
their
natural
dispositions
but
since
the
general
plan
of
the
universe
chosen
by
god
for
superior
reasons
causes
men
to
be
in
different
circumstances
those
who
meet
with
such
as
are
more
favourable
to
their
nature
will
become
more
readily
the
least
wicked
the
most
virtuous
the
most
happy
yet
it
will
be
always
by
aid
of
the
influence
of
that
inward
grace
which
god
unites
with
the
circumstances
sometimes
it
even
comes
to
pass
in
the
progress
of
human
life
that
a
more
excellent
nature
succeeds
less
for
lack
of
cultivation
or
opportunities
one
may
say
that
men
are
chosen
and
ranged
not
so
much
according
to
their
excellence
as
according
to
their
conformity
with
god
plan
even
so
it
may
occur
that
a
stone
of
lesser
quality
is
made
use
of
in
a
building
or
in
a
group
because
it
proves
to
be
the
particular
one
for
filling
a
certain
gap
but
in
fine
all
these
attempts
to
find
reasons
where
there
is
no
need
to
adhere
altogether
to
certain
hypotheses
serve
only
to
make
clear
to
us
that
there
are
a
thousand
ways
of
justifying
the
conduct
of
god
all
the
disadvantages
we
see
all
the
obstacles
we
meet
with
all
the
difficulties
one
may
raise
for
oneself
are
no
hindrance
to
a
belief
founded
on
reason
even
when
it
can
not
stand
on
conclusive
proof
as
has
been
shown
and
will
later
become
more
apparent
that
there
is
nothing
so
exalted
as
the
wisdom
of
god
nothing
so
just
as
his
judgements
nothing
so
pure
as
his
holiness
and
nothing
more
vast
than
his
goodness
essays
on
the
justice
of
god
and
the
freedom
of
man
in
the
origin
of
evil
part
two
hitherto
i
have
devoted
myself
to
giving
a
full
and
clear
exposition
of
this
whole
subject
and
although
i
have
not
yet
spoken
of
objections
in
particular
i
have
endeavoured
to
anticipate
them
and
to
suggest
ways
of
answering
them
but
as
i
have
taken
upon
myself
the
task
of
meeting
them
in
detail
not
only
because
there
will
perhaps
still
be
passages
calling
for
elucidation
but
also
because
his
arguments
are
usually
full
of
wit
and
erudition
and
serve
to
throw
greater
light
on
this
controversy
it
will
be
well
to
give
an
account
of
the
chief
objections
that
are
dispersed
through
his
works
and
to
add
my
answers
at
the
beginning
i
observed
god
in
moral
evil
and
in
physical
evil
and
in
each
of
them
both
morally
and
physically
and
that
man
therein
also
morally
and
physically
in
a
free
and
active
way
becoming
in
consequence
subject
to
blame
and
punishment
i
have
shown
also
that
each
point
has
its
own
difficulty
but
the
greatest
of
these
lies
in
maintaining
that
god
morally
in
moral
evil
that
is
in
sin
without
being
the
originator
of
the
sin
and
even
without
being
accessary
thereto
he
does
this
by
it
justly
and
by
it
wisely
towards
the
good
as
i
have
shown
in
a
manner
that
appears
tolerably
intelligible
but
as
it
is
here
principally
that
bayle
undertakes
to
discomfit
those
who
maintain
that
there
is
nothing
in
faith
which
can
not
be
harmonized
with
reason
it
is
also
here
especially
i
must
show
that
my
dogmas
are
fortified
to
make
use
of
his
own
allegory
with
a
rampart
even
of
reasons
which
is
able
to
resist
the
fire
of
his
strongest
batteries
he
has
ranged
them
against
me
in
chapter
of
his
to
the
questions
of
a
vol
iii
where
he
includes
the
theological
doctrine
in
seven
propositions
and
opposes
thereto
nineteen
philosophic
maxims
like
so
many
large
cannon
capable
of
breaching
my
rampart
let
us
begin
with
the
theological
propositions
i
he
says
being
eternal
and
necessary
infinitely
good
holy
wise
and
powerful
possesses
from
all
eternity
a
glory
and
a
bliss
that
can
never
either
increase
or
diminish
this
proposition
of
is
no
less
philosophical
than
theological
to
say
that
god
possesses
a
when
he
is
alone
that
depends
upon
the
meaning
of
the
term
one
may
say
with
some
that
glory
is
the
satisfaction
one
finds
in
being
aware
of
one
own
perfections
and
in
this
sense
god
possesses
it
always
but
when
glory
signifies
that
others
become
aware
of
these
perfections
one
may
say
that
god
acquires
it
only
when
he
reveals
himself
to
intelligent
creatures
even
though
it
be
true
that
god
thereby
gains
no
new
good
and
it
is
rather
the
rational
creatures
who
thence
derive
advantage
when
they
apprehend
aright
the
glory
of
god
ii
resolved
freely
upon
the
production
of
creatures
and
he
chose
from
among
an
infinite
number
of
possible
beings
those
whom
it
pleased
him
to
choose
to
give
them
existence
and
to
compose
the
universe
of
them
while
he
left
all
the
rest
in
nothingness
this
proposition
is
also
just
like
the
preceding
one
in
close
conformity
with
that
part
of
philosophy
which
is
called
natural
theology
one
must
dwell
a
little
on
what
is
said
here
that
he
chose
the
possible
beings
it
pleased
him
to
choose
for
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
when
i
say
pleases
me
it
is
as
though
i
were
saying
find
it
good
thus
it
is
the
ideal
goodness
of
the
object
which
pleases
and
which
makes
me
choose
it
among
many
others
which
do
not
please
or
which
please
less
that
is
to
say
which
contain
less
of
that
goodness
which
moves
me
now
it
is
only
the
genuinely
good
that
is
capable
of
pleasing
god
and
consequently
that
which
pleases
god
most
and
which
meets
his
choice
is
the
best
iii
nature
having
been
among
the
beings
that
he
willed
to
produce
he
created
a
man
and
a
woman
and
granted
them
amongst
other
favours
free
will
so
that
they
had
the
power
to
obey
him
but
he
threatened
them
with
death
if
they
should
disobey
the
order
that
he
gave
them
to
abstain
from
a
certain
fruit
this
proposition
is
in
part
revealed
and
should
be
admitted
without
difficulty
provided
that
be
understood
properly
according
to
the
explanation
i
have
given
iv
ate
thereof
nevertheless
and
thenceforth
they
were
condemned
they
and
all
their
posterity
to
the
miseries
of
this
life
to
temporal
death
and
eternal
damnation
and
made
subject
to
such
a
tendency
to
sin
that
they
abandoned
themselves
thereto
endlessly
and
without
ceasing
there
is
reason
to
suppose
that
the
forbidden
action
by
itself
entailed
these
evil
results
in
accordance
with
a
natural
effect
and
that
it
was
for
that
very
reason
and
not
by
a
purely
arbitrary
decree
that
god
had
forbidden
it
much
as
one
forbids
knives
to
children
the
famous
fludde
or
de
fluctibus
an
englishman
once
wrote
a
book
vita
morte
et
under
the
name
of
otreb
wherein
he
maintained
that
the
fruit
of
the
forbidden
tree
was
a
poison
but
we
can
not
enter
into
this
detail
it
suffices
that
god
forbade
a
harmful
thing
one
must
not
therefore
suppose
that
god
acted
here
simply
in
the
character
of
a
legislator
who
enacts
a
purely
positive
law
or
of
a
judge
who
imposes
and
inflicts
a
punishment
by
an
order
of
his
will
without
any
connexion
between
the
evil
of
guilt
and
the
evil
of
punishment
and
it
is
not
necessary
to
suppose
that
god
in
justifiable
annoyance
deliberately
put
a
corruption
in
the
soul
and
the
body
of
man
by
an
extraordinary
action
in
order
to
punish
him
much
as
the
athenians
gave
to
their
criminals
bayle
takes
the
matter
thus
he
speaks
as
if
the
original
corruption
had
been
put
in
the
soul
of
the
first
man
by
an
order
and
operation
of
god
it
is
that
which
calls
forth
his
objection
to
the
questions
of
a
vol
iii
ch
reason
would
not
commend
the
monarch
who
in
order
to
chastise
a
rebel
condemned
him
and
his
descendants
to
have
a
tendency
towards
rebellion
but
this
chastisement
happens
naturally
to
the
wicked
without
any
ordinance
of
a
legislator
and
they
become
addicted
to
evil
if
drunkards
begot
children
inclined
to
the
same
vice
by
a
natural
consequence
of
what
takes
place
in
bodies
that
would
be
a
punishment
of
their
progenitors
but
it
would
not
be
a
penalty
of
law
there
is
something
comparable
to
this
in
the
consequences
of
the
first
man
sin
for
the
contemplation
of
divine
wisdom
leads
us
to
believe
that
the
realm
of
nature
serves
that
of
grace
and
that
god
as
an
architect
has
done
all
in
a
manner
befitting
god
considered
as
a
monarch
we
do
not
sufficiently
know
the
nature
of
the
forbidden
fruit
or
that
of
the
action
or
its
effects
to
judge
of
the
details
of
this
matter
nevertheless
we
must
do
god
justice
so
far
as
to
believe
that
it
comprised
something
other
than
what
painters
depict
for
us
has
pleased
him
by
his
infinite
mercy
to
deliver
a
very
few
men
from
this
condemnation
and
leaving
them
exposed
during
this
life
to
the
corruption
of
sin
and
misery
he
has
given
them
aids
which
enable
them
to
obtain
the
bliss
of
paradise
many
in
the
past
have
doubted
as
i
have
already
observed
whether
the
number
of
the
damned
is
so
great
as
is
generally
supposed
and
it
appears
that
they
believed
in
the
existence
of
some
intermediate
state
between
eternal
damnation
and
perfect
bliss
but
we
have
no
need
of
these
opinions
and
it
is
enough
to
keep
to
the
ideas
accepted
in
the
church
in
this
connexion
it
is
well
to
observe
that
this
proposition
of
bayle
is
conceived
in
accordance
with
the
principles
of
sufficient
grace
given
to
all
men
and
sufficing
them
provided
that
they
have
good
will
although
bayle
holds
the
opposite
opinion
he
wished
as
he
states
in
the
margin
to
avoid
the
terms
that
would
not
agree
with
a
system
of
decrees
subsequent
to
the
prevision
of
contingent
events
vi
foresaw
from
eternity
all
that
which
should
happen
he
ordered
all
things
and
placed
them
each
one
in
its
own
place
and
he
guides
and
controls
them
continually
according
to
his
pleasure
thus
nothing
is
done
without
his
permission
or
against
his
will
and
he
can
prevent
as
seems
good
to
him
as
much
and
as
often
as
seems
good
to
him
all
that
does
not
please
him
and
in
consequence
sin
which
is
the
thing
in
the
world
that
most
offends
him
and
that
he
most
detests
and
he
can
produce
in
each
human
soul
all
the
thoughts
that
he
approves
this
thesis
is
also
purely
philosophic
that
is
recognizable
by
the
light
of
natural
reason
it
is
opportune
also
as
one
has
dwelt
in
thesis
ii
on
which
to
dwell
here
upon
which
seems
that
is
upon
that
which
god
finds
good
to
do
he
can
avoid
or
put
away
as
good
to
him
all
does
not
please
him
nevertheless
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
some
objects
of
his
aversion
such
as
certain
evils
and
especially
sin
which
his
antecedent
will
repelled
could
only
have
been
rejected
by
his
consequent
or
decretory
will
in
so
far
as
it
was
prompted
by
the
rule
of
the
best
which
the
must
choose
after
having
taken
all
into
account
when
one
says
sin
offends
god
most
and
that
he
detests
it
most
these
are
human
ways
of
speaking
god
can
not
properly
speaking
be
that
is
injured
disturbed
disquieted
or
angered
and
he
nothing
of
that
which
exists
in
the
sense
that
to
detest
something
is
to
look
upon
it
with
abomination
and
in
a
way
that
causes
us
disgust
that
greatly
pains
and
distresses
us
for
god
can
not
suffer
either
vexation
or
grief
or
discomfort
he
is
always
altogether
content
and
at
ease
yet
these
expressions
in
their
true
sense
are
justified
the
supreme
goodness
of
god
causes
his
antecedent
will
to
repel
all
evil
but
moral
evil
more
than
any
other
it
only
admits
evil
at
all
for
irresistible
superior
reasons
and
with
great
correctives
which
repair
its
ill
effects
to
good
advantage
it
is
true
also
that
god
could
produce
in
each
human
soul
all
the
thoughts
that
he
approves
but
this
would
be
to
act
by
miracles
more
than
his
most
perfectly
conceived
plan
admits
vii
offers
grace
to
people
that
he
knows
are
destined
not
to
accept
it
and
so
destined
by
this
refusal
to
make
themselves
more
criminal
than
they
would
be
if
he
had
not
offered
them
that
grace
he
assures
them
that
it
is
his
ardent
wish
that
they
accept
it
and
he
does
not
give
them
the
grace
which
he
knows
they
would
accept
it
is
true
that
these
people
become
more
criminal
through
their
refusal
than
if
one
had
offered
them
nothing
and
that
god
knows
this
yet
it
is
better
to
permit
their
crime
than
to
act
in
a
way
which
would
render
god
himself
blameworthy
and
provide
the
criminals
with
some
justification
for
the
complaint
that
it
was
not
possible
for
them
to
do
better
even
though
they
had
or
might
have
wished
it
god
desires
that
they
receive
such
grace
from
him
as
they
are
fit
to
receive
and
that
they
accept
it
and
he
desires
to
give
them
in
particular
that
grace
whose
acceptance
by
them
he
foresees
but
it
is
always
by
a
will
antecedent
detached
or
particular
which
can
not
always
be
carried
out
in
the
general
plan
of
things
this
thesis
also
is
among
the
number
of
those
which
philosophy
establishes
no
less
than
revelation
like
three
others
of
the
seven
that
we
have
just
stated
here
the
third
fourth
and
fifth
being
the
only
ones
where
revelation
is
necessary
here
now
are
the
nineteen
philosophic
maxims
which
bayle
opposes
to
the
seven
theological
propositions
i
the
infinitely
perfect
being
finds
in
himself
a
glory
and
a
bliss
that
can
never
either
diminish
or
increase
his
goodness
alone
has
determined
him
to
create
this
universe
neither
the
ambition
to
be
praised
nor
any
interested
motive
of
preserving
or
augmenting
his
bliss
and
his
glory
has
had
any
part
therein
this
maxim
is
very
good
praises
of
god
do
him
no
service
but
they
are
of
service
to
the
men
who
praise
him
and
he
desired
their
good
nevertheless
when
one
says
that
alone
determined
god
to
create
this
universe
it
is
well
to
add
that
his
goodness
prompted
him
to
create
and
to
produce
all
possible
good
but
that
his
wisdom
made
the
choice
and
caused
him
to
select
the
best
and
finally
that
his
power
gave
him
the
means
to
carry
out
the
great
design
which
he
had
formed
ii
goodness
of
the
infinitely
perfect
being
is
infinite
and
would
not
be
infinite
if
one
could
conceive
of
a
goodness
greater
than
this
this
characteristic
of
infinity
is
proper
also
to
all
his
other
perfections
to
love
of
virtue
hatred
of
vice
they
must
be
the
greatest
one
can
imagine
see
jurieu
in
the
first
three
sections
of
the
on
where
he
argues
constantly
upon
this
principle
as
upon
a
primary
notion
see
also
in
wittich
providentia
these
words
of
augustine
lib
i
doctrina
cum
cogitatur
deus
ita
cogitatur
ut
aliquid
quo
nihil
melius
sit
atque
sublimius
et
paulo
post
nec
quisquam
inveniri
potest
qui
hoc
deum
credat
esse
quo
melius
aliquid
est
this
maxim
is
altogether
to
my
liking
and
i
draw
from
it
this
conclusion
that
god
does
the
very
best
possible
otherwise
the
exercise
of
his
goodness
would
be
restricted
and
that
would
be
restricting
his
itself
if
it
did
not
prompt
him
to
the
best
if
he
were
lacking
in
good
will
or
again
it
would
be
restricting
his
and
his
if
he
lacked
the
knowledge
necessary
for
discerning
the
best
and
for
finding
the
means
to
obtain
it
or
if
he
lacked
the
strength
necessary
for
employing
these
means
there
is
however
ambiguity
in
the
assertion
that
love
of
virtue
and
hatred
of
vice
are
infinite
in
god
if
that
were
absolutely
and
unreservedly
true
in
practice
there
would
be
no
vice
in
the
world
but
although
each
one
of
god
perfections
is
infinite
in
itself
it
is
exercised
only
in
proportion
to
the
object
and
as
the
nature
of
things
prompts
it
thus
love
of
the
best
in
the
whole
carries
the
day
over
all
other
individual
inclinations
or
hatreds
it
is
the
only
impulse
whose
very
exercise
is
absolutely
infinite
nothing
having
power
to
prevent
god
from
declaring
himself
for
the
best
and
some
vice
being
combined
with
the
best
possible
plan
god
permits
it
iii
infinite
goodness
having
guided
the
creator
in
the
production
of
the
world
all
the
characteristics
of
knowledge
skill
power
and
greatness
that
are
displayed
in
his
work
are
destined
for
the
happiness
of
intelligent
creatures
he
wished
to
show
forth
his
perfections
only
to
the
end
that
creatures
of
this
kind
should
find
their
felicity
in
the
knowledge
the
admiration
and
the
love
of
the
supreme
being
this
maxim
appears
to
me
not
sufficiently
exact
i
grant
that
the
happiness
of
intelligent
creatures
is
the
principal
part
of
god
design
for
they
are
most
like
him
but
nevertheless
i
do
not
see
how
one
can
prove
that
to
be
his
sole
aim
it
is
true
that
the
realm
of
nature
must
serve
the
realm
of
grace
but
since
all
is
connected
in
god
great
design
we
must
believe
that
the
realm
of
grace
is
also
in
some
way
adapted
to
that
of
nature
so
that
nature
preserves
the
utmost
order
and
beauty
to
render
the
combination
of
the
two
the
most
perfect
that
can
be
and
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
god
for
the
sake
of
some
lessening
of
moral
evil
would
reverse
the
whole
order
of
nature
each
perfection
or
imperfection
in
the
creature
has
its
value
but
there
is
none
that
has
an
infinite
value
thus
the
moral
or
physical
good
and
evil
of
rational
creatures
does
not
infinitely
exceed
the
good
and
evil
which
is
simply
metaphysical
namely
that
which
lies
in
the
perfection
of
the
other
creatures
and
yet
one
would
be
bound
to
say
this
if
the
present
maxim
were
strictly
true
when
god
justified
to
the
prophet
jonah
the
pardon
that
he
had
granted
to
the
inhabitants
of
nineveh
he
even
touched
upon
the
interest
of
the
beasts
who
would
have
been
involved
in
the
ruin
of
this
great
city
no
substance
is
absolutely
contemptible
or
absolutely
precious
before
god
and
the
abuse
or
the
exaggerated
extension
of
the
present
maxim
appears
to
be
in
part
the
source
of
the
difficulties
that
bayle
puts
forward
it
is
certain
that
god
sets
greater
store
by
a
man
than
a
lion
nevertheless
it
can
hardly
be
said
with
certainty
that
god
prefers
a
single
man
in
all
respects
to
the
whole
of
even
should
that
be
so
it
would
by
no
means
follow
that
the
interest
of
a
certain
number
of
men
would
prevail
over
the
consideration
of
a
general
disorder
diffused
through
an
infinite
number
of
creatures
this
opinion
would
be
a
remnant
of
the
old
and
somewhat
discredited
maxim
that
all
is
made
solely
for
man
iv
benefits
he
imparts
to
the
creatures
that
are
capable
of
felicity
tend
only
to
their
happiness
he
therefore
does
not
permit
that
these
should
serve
to
make
them
unhappy
and
if
the
wrong
use
that
they
made
of
them
were
capable
of
destroying
them
he
would
give
them
sure
means
of
always
using
them
well
otherwise
they
would
not
be
true
benefits
and
his
goodness
would
be
smaller
than
that
we
can
conceive
of
in
another
benefactor
i
mean
in
a
cause
that
united
with
its
gifts
the
sure
skill
to
make
good
use
of
them
there
already
is
the
abuse
or
the
ill
effect
of
the
preceding
maxim
it
is
not
strictly
true
though
it
appear
plausible
that
the
benefits
god
imparts
to
the
creatures
who
are
capable
of
felicity
tend
solely
to
their
happiness
all
is
connected
in
nature
and
if
a
skilled
artisan
an
engineer
an
architect
a
wise
politician
often
makes
one
and
the
same
thing
serve
several
ends
if
he
makes
a
double
hit
with
a
single
throw
when
that
can
be
done
conveniently
one
may
say
that
god
whose
wisdom
and
power
are
perfect
does
so
always
that
is
husbanding
the
ground
the
time
the
place
the
material
which
make
up
as
it
were
his
outlay
thus
god
has
more
than
one
purpose
in
his
projects
the
felicity
of
all
rational
creatures
is
one
of
the
aims
he
has
in
view
but
it
is
not
his
whole
aim
nor
even
his
final
aim
therefore
it
happens
that
the
unhappiness
of
some
of
these
creatures
may
come
about
and
as
a
result
of
other
greater
goods
this
i
have
already
explained
and
bayle
has
to
some
extent
acknowledged
it
the
goods
as
such
considered
in
themselves
are
the
object
of
the
antecedent
will
of
god
god
will
produce
as
much
reason
and
knowledge
in
the
universe
as
his
plan
can
admit
one
can
conceive
of
a
mean
between
an
antecedent
will
altogether
pure
and
primitive
and
a
consequent
and
final
will
the
antecedent
has
as
its
object
each
good
and
each
evil
in
itself
detached
from
all
combination
and
tends
to
advance
the
good
and
prevent
the
evil
the
relates
to
combinations
as
when
one
attaches
a
good
to
an
evil
then
the
will
will
have
some
tendency
towards
this
combination
when
the
good
exceeds
the
evil
therein
but
the
and
decisive
results
from
consideration
of
all
the
goods
and
all
the
evils
that
enter
into
our
deliberation
it
results
from
a
total
combination
this
shows
that
a
mediate
will
although
it
may
in
a
sense
pass
as
consequent
in
relation
to
a
pure
and
primitive
antecedent
will
must
be
considered
antecedent
in
relation
to
the
final
and
decretory
will
god
gives
reason
to
the
human
race
misfortunes
arise
thence
by
concomitance
his
pure
antecedent
will
tends
towards
giving
reason
as
a
great
good
and
preventing
the
evils
in
question
but
when
it
is
a
question
of
the
evils
that
accompany
this
gift
which
god
has
made
to
us
of
reason
the
compound
made
up
of
the
combination
of
reason
and
of
these
evils
will
be
the
object
of
a
mediate
will
of
god
which
will
tend
towards
producing
or
preventing
this
compound
according
as
the
good
or
the
evil
prevails
therein
but
even
though
it
should
prove
that
reason
did
more
harm
than
good
to
men
which
however
i
do
not
admit
whereupon
the
mediate
will
of
god
would
discard
it
with
all
its
concomitants
it
might
still
be
the
case
that
it
was
more
in
accordance
with
the
perfection
of
the
universe
to
give
reason
to
men
notwithstanding
all
the
evil
consequences
which
it
might
have
with
reference
to
them
consequently
the
final
will
or
the
decree
of
god
resulting
from
all
the
considerations
he
can
have
would
be
to
give
it
to
them
and
far
from
being
subject
to
blame
for
this
he
would
be
blameworthy
if
he
did
not
so
thus
the
evil
or
the
mixture
of
goods
and
evils
wherein
the
evil
prevails
happens
only
because
it
is
connected
with
greater
goods
that
are
outside
this
mixture
this
mixture
therefore
or
this
compound
is
not
to
be
conceived
as
a
grace
or
as
a
gift
from
god
to
us
but
the
good
that
is
found
mingled
therein
will
nevertheless
be
good
such
is
god
gift
of
reason
to
those
who
make
ill
use
thereof
it
is
always
a
good
in
itself
but
the
combination
of
this
good
with
the
evils
that
proceed
from
its
abuse
is
not
a
good
with
regard
to
those
who
in
consequence
thereof
become
unhappy
yet
it
comes
to
be
by
concomitance
because
it
serves
a
greater
good
in
relation
to
the
universe
and
it
is
doubtless
that
which
prompted
god
to
give
reason
to
those
who
have
made
it
an
instrument
of
their
unhappiness
or
to
put
it
more
precisely
in
accordance
with
my
system
god
having
found
among
the
possible
beings
some
rational
creatures
who
misuse
their
reason
gave
existence
to
those
who
are
included
in
the
best
possible
plan
of
the
universe
thus
nothing
prevents
us
from
admitting
that
god
grants
goods
which
turn
into
evil
by
the
fault
of
men
this
often
happening
to
men
in
just
punishment
of
the
misuse
they
had
made
of
god
grace
aloysius
novarinus
wrote
a
book
occultis
dei
one
could
write
one
occultis
dei
this
saying
of
claudian
would
be
in
place
here
with
regard
to
some
persons
in
altum
lapsu
graviore
but
to
say
that
god
should
not
give
a
good
which
he
knows
an
evil
will
will
abuse
when
the
general
plan
of
things
demands
that
he
give
it
or
again
to
say
that
he
should
give
certain
means
for
preventing
it
contrary
to
this
same
general
order
that
is
to
wish
as
i
have
observed
already
that
god
himself
become
blameworthy
in
order
to
prevent
man
from
being
so
to
object
as
people
do
here
that
the
goodness
of
god
would
be
smaller
than
that
of
another
benefactor
who
would
give
a
more
useful
gift
is
to
overlook
the
fact
that
the
goodness
of
a
benefactor
is
not
measured
by
a
single
benefit
it
may
well
be
that
a
gift
from
a
private
person
is
greater
than
one
from
a
prince
but
the
gifts
of
this
private
person
all
taken
together
will
be
much
inferior
to
the
prince
gifts
all
together
thus
one
can
esteem
fittingly
the
good
things
done
by
god
only
when
one
considers
their
whole
extent
by
relating
them
to
the
entire
universe
moreover
one
may
say
that
the
gifts
given
in
the
expectation
that
they
will
harm
are
the
gifts
of
an
enemy
greek

but
that
applies
to
when
there
is
malice
or
guilt
in
him
who
gives
them
as
there
was
in
that
eutrapelus
of
whom
horace
speaks
who
did
good
to
people
in
order
to
give
them
the
means
of
destroying
themselves
his
design
was
evil
but
god
design
can
not
be
better
than
it
is
must
god
spoil
his
system
must
there
be
less
beauty
perfection
and
reason
in
the
universe
because
there
are
people
who
misuse
reason
the
common
sayings
are
in
place
here
non

et
scandalum
maleficent
being
is
very
capable
of
heaping
magnificent
gifts
upon
his
enemies
when
he
knows
that
they
will
make
thereof
a
use
that
will
destroy
them
it
therefore
does
not
beseem
the
infinitely
good
being
to
give
to
creatures
a
free
will
whereof
as
he
knows
for
certain
they
would
make
a
use
that
would
render
them
unhappy
therefore
if
he
gives
them
free
will
he
combines
with
it
the
art
of
using
it
always
opportunely
and
permits
not
that
they
neglect
the
practice
of
this
art
in
any
conjuncture
and
if
there
were
no
sure
means
of
determining
the
good
use
of
this
free
will
he
would
rather
take
from
them
this
faculty
than
allow
it
to
be
the
cause
of
their
unhappiness
that
is
the
more
manifest
as
free
will
is
a
grace
which
he
has
given
them
of
his
own
choice
and
without
their
asking
for
it
so
that
he
would
be
more
answerable
for
the
unhappiness
it
would
bring
upon
them
than
if
he
had
only
granted
it
in
response
to
their
importunate
prayers
what
was
said
at
the
end
of
the
remark
on
the
preceding
maxim
ought
to
be
repeated
here
and
is
sufficient
to
counter
the
present
maxim
moreover
the
author
is
still
presupposing
that
false
maxim
advanced
as
the
third
stating
that
the
happiness
of
rational
creatures
is
the
sole
aim
of
god
if
that
were
so
perhaps
neither
sin
nor
unhappiness
would
ever
occur
even
by
concomitance
god
would
have
chosen
a
sequence
of
possibles
where
all
these
evils
would
be
excluded
but
god
would
fail
in
what
is
due
to
the
universe
that
is
in
what
he
owes
to
himself
if
there
were
only
spirits
they
would
be
without
the
required
connexion
without
the
order
of
time
and
place
this
order
demands
matter
movement
and
its
laws
to
adjust
these
to
spirits
in
the
best
possible
way
means
to
return
to
our
world
when
one
looks
at
things
only
in
the
mass
one
imagines
to
be
practicable
a
thousand
things
that
can
not
properly
take
place
to
wish
that
god
should
not
give
free
will
to
rational
creatures
is
to
wish
that
there
be
none
of
these
creatures
and
to
wish
that
god
should
prevent
them
from
misusing
it
is
to
wish
that
there
be
none
but
these
creatures
alone
together
with
what
was
made
for
them
only
if
god
had
none
but
these
creatures
in
view
he
would
doubtless
prevent
them
from
destroying
themselves
one
may
say
in
a
sense
however
that
god
has
given
to
these
creatures
the
art
of
always
making
good
use
of
their
free
will
for
the
natural
light
of
reason
is
this
art
but
it
would
be
necessary
always
to
have
the
will
to
do
good
and
often
creatures
lack
the
means
of
giving
themselves
the
will
they
ought
to
have
often
they
even
lack
the
will
to
use
those
means
which
indirectly
give
a
good
will
of
this
i
have
already
spoken
more
than
once
this
fault
must
be
admitted
and
one
must
even
acknowledge
that
god
would
perhaps
have
been
able
to
exempt
creatures
from
that
fault
since
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
so
it
seems
the
existence
of
some
whose
nature
it
would
be
always
to
have
good
will
but
i
reply
that
it
is
not
necessary
and
that
it
was
not
feasible
for
all
rational
creatures
to
have
so
great
a
perfection
and
such
as
would
bring
them
so
close
to
the
divinity
it
may
even
be
that
that
can
only
be
made
possible
by
a
special
divine
grace
but
in
this
case
would
it
be
proper
for
god
to
grant
it
to
all
that
is
always
to
act
miraculously
in
respect
of
all
rational
creatures
nothing
would
be
less
rational
than
these
perpetual
miracles
there
are
degrees
among
creatures
the
general
order
requires
it
and
it
appears
quite
consistent
with
the
order
of
divine
government
that
the
great
privilege
of
strengthening
in
the
good
should
be
granted
more
easily
to
those
who
had
a
good
will
when
they
were
in
a
more
imperfect
state
in
the
state
of
struggle
and
of
pilgrimage
ecclesia
militante
in
statu
the
good
angels
themselves
were
not
created
incapable
of
sin
nevertheless
i
would
not
dare
to
assert
that
there
are
no
blessed
creatures
born
or
such
as
are
sinless
and
holy
by
their
nature
there
are
perhaps
people
who
give
this
privilege
to
the
blessed
virgin
since
moreover
the
roman
church
places
her
above
the
angels
but
it
suffices
us
that
the
universe
is
very
great
and
very
varied
to
wish
to
limit
it
is
to
have
little
knowledge
thereof
bayle
goes
on
has
given
free
will
to
creatures
capable
of
sinning
without
their
having
asked
him
for
this
grace
and
he
who
gave
such
a
gift
would
be
more
answerable
for
the
unhappiness
that
it
brought
upon
those
who
made
use
of
it
than
if
he
had
granted
it
only
in
response
to
their
importunate
prayers
but
importunity
in
prayers
makes
no
difference
to
god
he
knows
better
than
we
what
we
need
and
he
only
grants
what
serves
the
interest
of
the
whole
it
seems
that
bayle
here
makes
free
will
consist
in
the
faculty
for
sinning
yet
he
acknowledges
elsewhere
that
god
and
the
saints
are
free
without
having
this
faculty
however
that
may
be
i
have
already
shown
fully
that
god
doing
what
his
wisdom
and
his
goodness
combined
ordain
is
not
answerable
for
the
evil
that
he
permits
even
men
when
they
do
their
duty
are
not
answerable
for
consequences
whether
they
foresee
them
or
not
vi
is
as
sure
a
means
of
taking
a
man
life
to
give
him
a
silk
cord
that
one
knows
certainly
he
will
make
use
of
freely
to
strangle
himself
as
to
plant
a
few
dagger
thrusts
in
his
body
one
desires
his
death
not
less
when
one
makes
use
of
the
first
way
than
when
one
employs
the
second
it
even
seems
as
though
one
desires
it
with
a
more
malicious
intention
since
one
tends
to
leave
to
him
the
whole
trouble
and
the
whole
blame
of
his
destruction
those
who
write
treatises
on
duties

for

cicero
ambrose
grotius
opalenius

as

teach
that
there
are

one
is
not
obliged
to
return
to
its
owner

thing
deposited

will
not
give
back

that

has
deposited

these
things
are
demanded
back
from
me
and
i
am
right
in
refusing
them
knowing
the
use
that
will
be
made
of
them
but
how
will
it
be
if
a
competent
judge
orders
me
to
restore
them
when
i
can
not
prove
to
him
what
i
know
of
the
evil
consequences
that
restitution
will
have

i
should
then
be
compelled
to
make

than

god
in

can

he
is
not

there

they

the

the

of

after
that
the

that
occurs
is
an

add

stronger
to
permit

permits

would
need
to
have
a

towards

to

after
this
that
it
is
more
malicious
to
leave
to
someone
the
whole
trouble
and
the
whole
blame
of
his
destruction
when
god
does
leave
it
to
a
man
it
has
belonged
to
him
since
before
his
existence
it
was
already
in
the
idea
of
him
as
still
merely
possible
before
the
decree
of
god
which
makes
him
to
exist
can
one
then
leave
it
or
give
it
to
another
there
is
the
whole
matter
vii
true
benefactor
gives
promptly
and
does
not
wait
to
give
until
those
he
loves
have
suffered
long
miseries
from
the
privation
of
what
he
could
have
imparted
to
them
at
first
very
easily
and
without
causing
any
inconvenience
to
himself
if
the
limitation
of
his
forces
does
not
permit
him
to
do
good
without
inflicting
pain
or
some
other
inconvenience
he
acquiesces
in
this
but
only
regretfully
and
he
never
employs
this
way
of
rendering
service
when
he
can
render
it
without
mingling
any
kind
of
evil
in
his
favours
if
the
profit
one
could
derive
from
the
evils
he
inflicted
could
spring
as
easily
from
an
unalloyed
good
as
from
those
evils
he
would
take
the
straight
road
of
unalloyed
good
and
not
the
indirect
road
that
would
lead
from
the
evil
to
the
good
if
he
showers
riches
and
honours
it
is
not
to
the
end
that
those
who
have
enjoyed
them
when
they
come
to
lose
them
should
be
all
the
more
deeply
afflicted
in
proportion
to
their
previous
experience
of
pleasure
and
that
thus
they
should
become
more
unhappy
than
the
persons
who
have
always
been
deprived
of
these
advantages
a
malicious
being
would
shower
good
things
at
such
a
price
upon
the
people
for
whom
he
had
the
most
hatred

all
these
objections
depend
almost
on
the

sophism
they
change
and
mutilate
the
fact
they
only
half
record
things
god
has
care
for
men
he
loves
the
human
race
he
wishes
it
well
nothing
so
true
yet
he
allows
men
to
fall
he
often
allows
them
to
perish
he
gives
them
goods
that
tend
towards
their
destruction
and
when
he
makes
someone
happy
it
is
after
many
sufferings
where
is
his
affection
where
is
his
goodness
or
again
where
is
his
power
vain
objections
which
suppress
the
main
point
which
ignore
the
fact
that
it
is
of
god
one
speaks
it
is
as
though
one
were
speaking
of
a
mother
a
guardian
a
tutor
whose
only
care
is
concerned
with
the
upbringing
the
preservation
the
happiness
of
the
person
in
question
and
who
neglect
their
duty
god
takes
care
of
the
universe
he
neglects
nothing
he
chooses
what
is
best
on
the
whole
if
in
spite
of
all
that
someone
is
wicked
and
unhappy
it
behoved
him
to
be
so
god
so
they
say
could
have
given
happiness
to
all
he
could
have
given
it
promptly
and
easily
and
without
causing
himself
any
inconvenience
for
he
can
do
all
but
should
he
since
he
does
not
so
it
is
a
sign
that
he
had
to
act
altogether
differently
if
we
infer
from
this
either
that
god
only
regretfully
and
owing
to
lack
of
power
fails
to
make
men
happy
and
to
give
the
good
first
of
all
and
without
admixture
of
evil
or
else
that
he
lacks
the
good
will
to
give
it
unreservedly
and
for
good
and
all
then
we
are
comparing
our
true
god
with
the
god
of
herodotus
full
of
envy
or
with
the
demon
of
the
poet
whose
iambics
aristotle
quotes
and
i
have
just
translated
into
latin
who
gives
good
things
in
order
that
he
may
cause
more
affliction
by
taking
them
away
that
would
be
trifling
with
god
in
perpetual
anthropomorphisms
representing
him
as
a
man
who
must
give
himself
up
completely
to
one
particular
business
whose
goodness
must
be
chiefly
exercised
upon
those
objects
alone
which
are
known
to
us
and
who
lacks
either
aptitude
or
good
will
god
is
not
lacking
therein
he
could
do
the
good
that
we
would
desire
he
even
wishes
it
taking
it
separately
but
he
must
not
do
it
in
preference
to
other
greater
goods
which
are
opposed
to
it
moreover
one
has
no
cause
to
complain
of
the
fact
that
usually
one
attains
salvation
only
through
many
sufferings
and
by
bearing
the
cross
of
jesus
christ
these
evils
serve
to
make
the
elect
imitators
of
their
master
and
to
increase
their
happiness
viii
greatest
and
the
most
substantial
glory
that
he
who
is
the
master
of
others
can
gain
is
to
maintain
amongst
them
virtue
order
peace
contentment
of
mind
the
glory
that
he
would
derive
from
their
unhappiness
can
be
nothing
but
a
false
glory
if
we
knew
the
city
of
god
just
as
it
is
we
should
see
that
it
is
the
most
perfect
state
which
can
be
devised
that
virtue
and
happiness
reign
there
as
far
as
is
possible
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
the
best
that
sin
and
unhappiness
whose
entire
exclusion
from
the
nature
of
things
reasons
of
the
supreme
order
did
not
permit
are
nothing
there
in
comparison
with
the
good
and
even
are
of
service
for
greater
good
now
since
these
evils
were
to
exist
there
must
needs
be
some
appointed
to
be
subject
to
them
and
we
are
those
people
if
it
were
others
would
there
not
be
the
same
appearance
of
evil
or
rather
would
not
these
others
be
those
known
as
we
when
god
derives
some
glory
from
the
evil
through
having
made
it
serve
a
greater
good
it
was
proper
that
he
should
derive
that
glory
it
is
not
therefore
a
false
glory
as
would
be
that
of
a
prince
who
overthrew
his
state
in
order
to
have
the
honour
of
setting
it
up
again
ix
way
whereby
that
master
can
give
proof
of
greatest
love
for
virtue
is
to
cause
it
if
he
can
to
be
always
practised
without
any
mixture
of
vice
if
it
is
easy
for
him
to
procure
for
his
subjects
this
advantage
and
nevertheless
he
permits
vice
to
raise
its
head
save
that
he
punishes
it
finally
after
having
long
tolerated
it
his
affection
for
virtue
is
not
the
greatest
one
can
conceive
it
is
therefore
not
infinite
i
am
not
yet
half
way
through
the
nineteen
maxims
and
already
i
am
weary
of
refuting
and
making
the
same
answer
always

unnecessarily
his
maxims
in
opposition
to
my
dogmas
if
things
connected
together
may
be
separated
the
parts
from
their
whole
the
human
kind
from
the
universe
god
attributes
the
one
from
the
other
power
from
wisdom
it
may
be
said
that
god
virtue
to
be
in
the
world
without
any
mixture
of
vice
and
even
that
he
can
do
so
but
since
he
has
permitted
vice
it
must
be
that
that
order
of
the
universe
which
was
found
preferable
to
every
other
plan
required
it
one
must
believe
that
it
is
not
permitted
to
do
otherwise
since
it
is
not
possible
to
do
better
it
is
a
hypothetical
necessity
a
moral
necessity
which
far
from
being
contrary
to
freedom
is
the
effect
of
its
choice
rationi
contraria
sunt
ea
nec
fieri
a
sapiente
posse
credendum
the
objection
is
made
here
that
god
affection
for
virtue
is
therefore
not
the
greatest
which
can
be
conceived
that
it
is
not
to
that
an
answer
has
already
been
given
on
the
second
maxim
in
the
assertion
that
god
affection
for
any
created
thing
whatsoever
is
proportionate
to
the
value
of
the
thing
virtue
is
the
noblest
quality
of
created
things
but
it
is
not
the
only
good
quality
of
creatures
there
are
innumerable
others
which
attract
the
inclination
of
god
from
all
these
inclinations
there
results
the
most
possible
good
and
it
turns
out
that
if
there
were
only
virtue
if
there
were
only
rational
creatures
there
would
be
less
good
midas
proved
to
be
less
rich
when
he
had
only
gold
and
besides
wisdom
must
vary
to
multiply
one
and
the
same
thing
only
would
be
superfluity
and
poverty
too
to
have
a
thousand
vergils
in
one
library
always
to
sing
the
airs
from
the
opera
of
cadmus
and
hermione
to
break
all
the
china
in
order
only
to
have
cups
of
gold
to
have
only
diamond
buttons
to
eat
nothing
but
partridges
to
drink
only
hungarian
or
shiraz
wine
would
one
call
that
reason
nature
had
need
of
animals
plants
inanimate
bodies
there
are
in
these
creatures
devoid
of
reason
marvels
which
serve
for
exercise
of
the
reason
what
would
an
intelligent
creature
do
if
there
were
no
unintelligent
things
what
would
it
think
of
if
there
were
neither
movement
nor
matter
nor
sense
if
it
had
only
distinct
thoughts
it
would
be
a
god
its
wisdom
would
be
without
bounds
that
is
one
of
the
results
of
my
meditations
as
soon
as
there
is
a
mixture
of
confused
thoughts
there
is
sense
there
is
matter
for
these
confused
thoughts
come
from
the
relation
of
all
things
one
to
the
other
by
way
of
duration
and
extent
thus
it
is
that
in
my
philosophy
there
is
no
rational
creature
without
some
organic
body
and
there
is
no
created
spirit
entirely
detached
from
matter
but
these
organic
bodies
vary
no
less
in
perfection
than
the
spirits
to
which
they
belong
therefore
since
god
wisdom
must
have
a
world
of
bodies
a
world
of
substances
capable
of
perception
and
incapable
of
reason
since
in
short
it
was
necessary
to
choose
from
all
the
things
possible
what
produced
the
best
effect
together
and
since
vice
entered
in
by
this
door
god
would
not
have
been
altogether
good
altogether
wise
if
he
had
excluded
it
x
way
to
evince
the
greatest
hatred
for
vice
is
not
indeed
to
allow
it
to
prevail
for
a
long
time
and
then
chastise
it
but
to
crush
it
before
its
birth
that
is
prevent
it
from
showing
itself
anywhere
a
king
for
example
who
put
his
finances
in
such
good
order
that
no
malversation
was
ever
committed
would
thus
display
more
hatred
for
the
wrong
done
by
factionaries
than
if
after
having
suffered
them
to
batten
on
the
blood
of
the
people
he
had
them
hanged
it
is
always
the
same
song
it
is
anthropomorphism
pure
and
simple
a
king
should
generally
have
nothing
so
much
at
heart
as
to
keep
his
subjects
free
from
oppression
one
of
his
greatest
interests
is
to
bring
good
order
into
his
finances
nevertheless
there
are
times
when
he
is
obliged
to
tolerate
vice
and
disorders
he
has
a
great
war
on
his
hands
he
is
in
a
state
of
exhaustion
he
has
no
choice
of
generals
it
is
necessary
to
humour
those
he
has
those
possessed
of
great
authority
with
the
soldiers
a
braccio
a
sforza
a
wallenstein
he
lacks
money
for
the
most
pressing
needs
it
is
necessary
to
turn
to
great
financiers
who
have
an
established
credit
and
he
must
at
the
same
time
connive
at
their
malversations
it
is
true
that
this
unfortunate
necessity
arises
most
often
from
previous
errors
it
is
not
the
same
with
god
he
has
need
of
no
man
he
commits
no
error
he
always
does
the
best
one
can
not
even
wish
that
things
may
go
better
when
one
understands
them
and
it
would
be
a
vice
in
the
author
of
things
if
he
wished
to
change
anything
whatsoever
in
them
if
he
wished
to
exclude
the
vice
that
was
found
there
is
this
state
with
perfect
government
where
good
is
willed
and
performed
as
far
as
it
is
possible
where
evil
even
serves
the
greatest
good
comparable
with
the
state
of
a
prince
whose
affairs
are
in
ruin
and
who
escapes
as
best
he
can
or
with
that
of
a
prince
who
encourages
oppression
in
order
to
punish
it
and
who
delights
to
see
the
little
men
with
begging
bowls
and
the
great
on
scaffolds
xi
ruler
devoted
to
the
interests
of
virtue
and
to
the
good
of
his
subjects
takes
the
utmost
care
to
ensure
that
they
never
disobey
his
laws
and
if
he
must
needs
chastise
them
for
their
disobedience
he
sees
to
it
that
the
penalty
cures
them
of
the
inclination
to
evil
and
restores
in
their
soul
a
strong
and
constant
tendency
towards
good
so
far
is
he
from
any
desire
that
the
penalty
for
the
error
should
incline
them
more
and
more
towards
evil
to
make
men
better
god
does
all
that
is
due
and
even
all
that
can
be
done
on
his
side
without
detriment
to
what
is
due
the
most
usual
aim
of
punishment
is
amendment
but
it
is
not
the
sole
aim
nor
that
which
god
always
intends
i
have
said
a
word
on
that
above
original
sin
which
disposes
men
towards
evil
is
not
merely
a
penalty
for
the
first
sin
it
is
a
natural
consequence
thereof
on
that
too
a
word
has
been
said
in
the
course
of
an
observation
on
the
fourth
theological
proposition
it
is
like
drunkenness
which
is
a
penalty
for
excess
in
drinking
and
is
at
the
same
time
a
natural
consequence
that
easily
leads
to
new
sins
xii
permit
the
evil
that
one
could
prevent
is
not
to
care
whether
it
be
committed
or
not
or
is
even
to
wish
that
it
be
committed
by
no
means
how
many
times
do
men
permit
evils
which
they
could
prevent
if
they
turned
all
their
efforts
in
that
direction
but
other
more
important
cares
prevent
them
from
doing
so
one
will
rarely
resolve
upon
adjusting
irregularities
in
the
coinage
while
one
is
involved
in
a
great
war
and
the
action
of
an
english
parliament
in
this
direction
a
little
before
the
peace
of
ryswyck
will
be
rather
praised
than
imitated
can
one
conclude
from
this
that
the
state
has
no
anxiety
about
this
irregularity
or
even
that
it
desires
it
god
has
a
far
stronger
reason
and
one
far
more
worthy
of
him
for
tolerating
evils
not
only
does
he
derive
from
them
greater
goods
but
he
finds
them
connected
with
the
greatest
goods
of
all
those
that
are
possible
so
that
it
would
be
a
fault
not
to
permit
them
xiii
is
a
very
great
fault
in
those
who
govern
if
they
do
not
care
whether
there
be
disorder
in
their
states
or
not
the
fault
is
still
greater
if
they
wish
and
even
desire
disorder
there
if
by
hidden
and
indirect
but
infallible
ways
they
stirred
up
a
sedition
in
their
states
to
bring
them
to
the
brink
of
ruin
in
order
to
gain
for
themselves
the
glory
of
showing
that
they
have
the
courage
and
the
prudence
necessary
for
saving
a
great
kingdom
on
the
point
of
perishing
they
would
be
most
deserving
of
condemnation
but
if
they
stirred
up
this
sedition
because
there
were
no
other
means
than
that
of
averting
the
total
ruin
of
their
subjects
and
of
strengthening
on
new
foundations
and
for
several
centuries
the
happiness
of
nations
one
must
needs
lament
the
unfortunate
necessity
see
above
pp
what
has
been
said
of
the
force
of
necessity
to
which
they
were
reduced
and
praise
them
for
the
use
that
they
made
thereof
this
maxim
with
divers
others
set
forth
here
is
not
applicable
to
the
government
of
god
not
to
mention
the
fact
that
it
is
only
the
disorders
of
a
very
small
part
of
his
kingdom
which
are
brought
up
in
objection
it
is
untrue
that
he
has
no
anxiety
about
evils
that
he
desires
them
that
he
brings
them
into
being
to
have
the
glory
of
allaying
them
god
wills
order
and
good
but
it
happens
sometimes
that
what
is
disorder
in
the
part
is
order
in
the
whole
i
have
already
stated
this
legal
axiom
est
nisi
tota
lege
inspecta
the
permission
of
evils
comes
from
a
kind
of
moral
necessity
god
is
constrained
to
this
by
his
wisdom
and
by
his
goodness
necessity
is
whereas
that
of
the
prince
spoken
of
in
the
maxim
is
his
state
is
one
of
the
most
corrupt
and
the
government
of
god
is
the
best
state
possible
xiv
permission
of
a
certain
evil
is
only
excusable
when
one
can
not
remedy
it
without
introducing
a
greater
evil
but
it
can
not
be
excusable
in
those
who
have
in
hand
a
remedy
more
efficacious
against
this
evil
and
against
all
the
other
evils
that
could
spring
from
the
suppression
of
this
one
the
maxim
is
true
but
it
can
not
be
brought
forward
against
the
government
of
god
supreme
reason
constrains
him
to
permit
the
evil
if
god
chose
what
would
not
be
the
best
absolutely
and
in
all
that
would
be
a
greater
evil
than
all
the
individual
evils
which
he
could
prevent
by
this
means
this
wrong
choice
would
destroy
his
wisdom
and
his
goodness
xv
being
infinitely
powerful
creator
of
matter
and
of
spirits
makes
whatever
he
wills
of
this
matter
and
these
spirits
there
is
no
situation
or
shape
that
he
can
not
communicate
to
spirits
if
he
then
permitted
a
physical
or
a
moral
evil
this
would
not
be
for
the
reason
that
otherwise
some
other
still
greater
physical
or
moral
evil
would
be
altogether
inevitable
none
of
those
reasons
for
the
mixture
of
good
and
evil
which
are
founded
on
the
limitation
of
the
forces
of
benefactors
can
apply
to
him
it
is
true
that
god
makes
of
matter
and
of
spirits
whatever
he
wills
but
he
is
like
a
good
sculptor
who
will
make
from
his
block
of
marble
only
that
which
he
judges
to
be
the
best
and
who
judges
well
god
makes
of
matter
the
most
excellent
of
all
possible
machines
he
makes
of
spirits
the
most
excellent
of
all
governments
conceivable
and
over
and
above
all
that
he
establishes
for
their
union
the
most
perfect
of
all
harmonies
according
to
the
system
i
have
proposed
now
since
physical
evil
and
moral
evil
occur
in
this
perfect
work
one
must
conclude
contrary
to
assurance
here
that
a
still
greater
evil
would
have
been
altogether
this
great
evil
would
be
that
god
would
have
chosen
ill
if
he
had
chosen
otherwise
than
he
has
chosen
it
is
true
that
god
is
infinitely
powerful
but
his
power
is
indeterminate
goodness
and
wisdom
combined
determine
him
to
produce
the
best
bayle
makes
elsewhere
an
objection
which
is
peculiar
to
him
which
he
derives
from
the
opinions
of
the
modern
cartesians
they
say
that
god
could
have
given
to
souls
what
thoughts
he
would
without
making
them
depend
upon
any
relation
to
the
body
by
this
means
souls
would
be
spared
a
great
number
of
evils
which
only
spring
from
derangement
of
the
body
more
will
be
said
of
this
later
now
it
is
sufficient
to
bear
in
mind
that
god
can
not
establish
a
system
and
full
of
dissonances
it
is
to
some
extent
the
nature
of
souls
to
represent
bodies
xvi
is
just
as
much
the
cause
of
an
event
when
one
brings
it
about
in
moral
ways
as
when
one
brings
it
about
in
physical
ways
a
minister
of
state
who
without
going
out
of
his
study
and
simply
by
utilizing
the
passions
of
the
leaders
of
a
faction
overthrew
all
their
plots
would
thus
be
bringing
about
the
ruin
of
this
faction
no
less
than
if
he
destroyed
it
by
a
surprise
attack
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
this
maxim
evil
is
always
attributed
to
moral
causes
and
not
always
to
physical
causes
here
i
observe
simply
that
if
i
could
not
prevent
the
sin
of
others
except
by
committing
a
sin
myself
i
should
be
justified
in
permitting
it
and
i
should
not
be
accessary
thereto
or
its
moral
cause
in
god
every
fault
would
represent
a
sin
it
would
be
even
more
than
sin
for
it
would
destroy
divinity
and
it
would
be
a
great
fault
in
him
not
to
choose
the
best
i
have
said
so
many
times
he
would
then
prevent
sin
by
something
worse
than
all
sins
xvii
is
all
the
same
whether
one
employ
a
necessary
cause
or
employ
a
free
cause
while
choosing
the
moments
when
one
knows
it
to
be
determined
if
i
imagine
that
gunpowder
has
the
power
to
ignite
or
not
to
ignite
when
fire
touches
it
and
if
i
know
for
certain
that
it
will
be
disposed
to
ignite
at
eight
in
the
morning
i
shall
be
just
as
much
the
cause
of
its
effects
if
i
apply
the
fire
to
it
at
that
hour
as
i
should
be
in
assuming
as
is
the
case
that
it
is
a
necessary
cause
for
where
i
am
concerned
it
would
no
longer
be
a
free
cause
i
should
be
catching
it
at
the
moment
when
i
knew
it
to
be
necessitated
by
its
own
choice
it
is
impossible
for
a
being
to
be
free
or
indifferent
with
regard
to
that
to
which
it
is
already
determined
and
at
the
time
when
it
is
determined
thereto
all
that
which
exists
exists
of
necessity
while
it
exists

the
nominalists
have
adopted
this
maxim
of
aristotle
scotus
and
sundry
other
schoolmen
appear
to
reject
it
but
fundamentally
their
distinctions
come
to
the
same
thing
see
the
jesuits
of
coimbra
on
this
passage
from
aristotle
this
maxim
may
pass
also
i
would
wish
only
to
change
something
in
the
phraseology
i
would
not
take
and
for
one
and
the
same
thing
and
would
not
place
and
in
antithesis
one
is
never
altogether
indifferent
with
an
indifference
of
equipoise
one
is
always
more
inclined
and
consequently
more
determined
on
one
side
than
on
another
but
one
is
never
necessitated
to
the
choice
that
one
makes
i
mean
here
a
absolute
and
metaphysical
for
it
must
be
admitted
that
god
that
wisdom
is
prompted
to
the
best
by
a
necessity
it
must
be
admitted
also
that
one
is
necessitated
to
the
choice
by
a
hypothetical
necessity
when
one
actually
makes
the
choice
and
even
before
one
is
necessitated
thereto
by
the
very
truth
of
the
futurition
since
one
will
do
it
these
hypothetical
necessities
do
no
harm
i
have
spoken
sufficiently
on
this
point
already
xviii
a
whole
great
people
has
become
guilty
of
rebellion
it
is
not
showing
clemency
to
pardon
the
hundred
thousandth
part
and
to
kill
all
the
rest
not
excepting
even
babes
and
sucklings
it
seems
to
be
assumed
here
that
there
are
a
hundred
thousand
times
more
damned
than
saved
and
that
children
dying
unbaptized
are
included
among
the
former
both
these
points
are
disputed
and
especially
the
damnation
of
these
children
i
have
spoken
of
this
above
bayle
urges
the
same
objection
elsewhere
to
the
questions
of
a
vol
iii
ch
see
clearly
he
says
the
sovereign
who
wishes
to
exercise
both
justice
and
clemency
when
a
city
has
revolted
must
be
content
with
the
punishment
of
a
small
number
of
mutineers
and
pardon
all
the
rest
for
if
the
number
of
those
who
are
chastised
is
as
a
thousand
to
one
in
comparison
with
those
whom
he
freely
pardons
he
can
not
be
accounted
mild
but
on
the
contrary
cruel
he
would
assuredly
be
accounted
an
abominable
tyrant
if
he
chose
punishments
of
long
duration
and
if
he
eschewed
bloodshed
only
because
he
was
convinced
that
men
would
prefer
death
to
a
miserable
life
and
if
finally
the
desire
to
take
revenge
were
more
responsible
for
his
severities
than
the
desire
to
turn
to
the
service
of
the
common
weal
the
penalty
that
he
would
inflict
on
almost
all
the
rebels
criminals
who
are
executed
are
considered
to
expiate
their
crimes
so
completely
by
the
loss
of
their
life
that
the
public
requires
nothing
more
and
is
indignant
when
executioners
are
clumsy
these
would
be
stoned
if
they
were
known
deliberately
to
give
repeated
strokes
of
the
axe
and
the
judges
who
are
present
at
the
execution
would
not
be
immune
from
danger
if
they
were
thought
to
take
pleasure
in
this
evil
sport
of
the
executioners
and
to
have
surreptitiously
urged
them
to
practise
it
note
that
this
is
not
to
be
understood
as
strictly
universal
there
are
cases
where
the
people
approve
of
the
slow
killing
of
certain
criminals
as
when
francis
i
thus
put
to
death
some
persons
accused
of
heresy
after
the
notorious
placards
of
no
pity
was
shown
to
ravaillac
who
was
tortured
in
divers
horrible
ways
see
the
vol
i
fol
see
also
pierre
matthieu
in
his
of
the
death
of
henry
and
do
not
forget
what
he
says
on
page
concerning
the
discussion
by
the
judges
with
regard
to
the
torture
of
this
parricide
it
is
an
exceptionally
notorious
fact
that
rulers
who
should
be
guided
by
paul
i
mean
who
should
condemn
to
the
extreme
penalty
all
those
whom
he
condemns
to
eternal
death
would
be
accounted
enemies
of
the
human
kind
and
destroyers
of
their
communities
it
is
incontestable
that
their
laws
far
from
being
fitted
in
accordance
with
the
aim
of
legislators
to
uphold
society
would
be
its
complete
ruin
apply
here
these
words
of
pliny
the
younger
lib
mandemus
memoriae
quod
vir
mitissimus
et
ob
hoc
quoque
maximus
thrasea
crebro
dicere
solebat
qui
vitia
odit
homines
odit
he
adds
that
it
was
said
of
the
laws
of
draco
an
athenian
lawgiver
that
they
had
not
been
written
with
ink
but
with
blood
because
they
punished
all
sins
with
the
extreme
penalty
and
because
damnation
is
a
penalty
even
worse
than
death
but
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
damnation
is
a
consequence
of
sin
thus
i
once
answered
a
friend
who
raised
as
an
objection
the
disproportion
existing
between
an
eternal
punishment
and
a
limited
crime
that
there
is
no
injustice
when
the
continuation
of
the
punishment
is
only
a
result
of
the
continuation
of
the
sin
i
will
speak
further
on
this
point
later
as
for
the
number
of
the
damned
even
though
it
should
be
incomparably
greater
among
men
than
the
number
of
the
saved
that
would
not
preclude
the
possibility
that
in
the
universe
the
happy
creatures
infinitely
outnumber
those
who
are
unhappy
such
examples
as
that
of
a
prince
who
punishes
only
the
leaders
of
rebels
or
of
a
general
who
has
a
regiment
decimated
are
of
no
importance
here
compels
the
prince
and
the
general
to
pardon
the
guilty
even
though
they
should
remain
wicked
god
only
pardons
those
who
become
better
he
can
distinguish
them
and
this
severity
is
more
consistent
with
perfect
justice
but
if
anyone
asks
why
god
gives
not
to
all
the
grace
of
conversion
the
question
is
of
a
different
nature
having
no
relation
to
the
present
maxim
i
have
already
answered
it
in
a
sense
not
in
order
to
find
god
reasons
but
to
show
that
he
can
not
lack
such
and
that
there
are
no
opposing
reasons
of
any
validity
moreover
we
know
that
sometimes
whole
cities
are
destroyed
and
the
inhabitants
put
to
the
sword
to
inspire
terror
in
the
rest
that
may
serve
to
shorten
a
great
war
or
a
rebellion
and
would
mean
a
saving
of
blood
through
the
shedding
of
it
there
is
no
decimation
there
we
can
not
assert
indeed
that
the
wicked
of
our
globe
are
punished
so
severely
in
order
to
intimidate
the
inhabitants
of
the
other
globes
and
to
make
them
better
yet
an
abundance
of
reasons
in
the
universal
harmony
which
are
unknown
to
us
because
we
know
not
sufficiently
the
extent
of
the
city
of
god
nor
the
form
of
the
general
republic
of
spirits
nor
even
the
whole
architecture
of
bodies
may
produce
the
same
effect
xix
physicians
who
chose
among
many
remedies
capable
of
curing
a
sick
man
whereof
divers
were
such
as
they
well
knew
he
would
take
with
enjoyment
precisely
that
one
which
they
knew
he
would
refuse
to
take
would
vainly
urge
and
pray
him
not
to
refuse
it
we
should
still
have
just
cause
for
thinking
that
they
had
no
desire
to
cure
him
for
if
they
wished
to
do
so
they
would
choose
for
him
among
those
good
medicines
one
which
they
knew
he
would
willingly
swallow
if
moreover
they
knew
that
rejection
of
the
remedy
they
offered
him
would
augment
his
sickness
to
the
point
of
making
it
fatal
one
could
not
help
saying
that
despite
all
their
exhortations
they
must
certainly
be
desirous
of
the
sick
death
god
wishes
to
save
all
men
that
means
that
he
would
save
them
if
men
themselves
did
not
prevent
it
and
did
not
refuse
to
receive
his
grace
and
he
is
not
bound
or
prompted
by
reason
always
to
overcome
their
evil
will
he
does
so
sometimes
nevertheless
when
superior
reasons
allow
of
it
and
when
his
consequent
and
decretory
will
which
results
from
all
his
reasons
makes
him
resolve
upon
the
election
of
a
certain
number
of
men
he
gives
aids
to
all
for
their
conversion
and
for
perseverance
and
these
aids
suffice
in
those
who
have
good
will
but
they
do
not
always
suffice
to
give
good
will
men
obtain
this
good
will
either
through
particular
aids
or
through
circumstances
which
cause
the
success
of
the
general
aids
god
can
not
refrain
from
offering
other
remedies
which
he
knows
men
will
reject
bringing
upon
themselves
all
the
greater
guilt
but
shall
one
wish
that
god
be
unjust
in
order
that
man
may
be
less
criminal
moreover
the
grace
that
does
not
serve
the
one
may
serve
the
other
and
indeed
always
serves
the
totality
of
god
plan
which
is
the
best
possible
in
conception
shall
god
not
give
the
rain
because
there
are
places
which
will
be
thereby
incommoded
shall
the
sun
not
shine
as
much
as
it
should
for
the
world
in
general
because
there
are
places
which
will
be
too
much
dried
up
in
consequence
in
short
all
these
comparisons
spoken
of
in
these
maxims
that
bayle
has
just
given
of
a
physician
a
benefactor
a
minister
of
state
a
prince
are
exceedingly
lame
because
it
is
well
known
what
their
duties
are
and
what
can
and
ought
to
be
the
object
of
their
cares
they
have
scarce
more
than
the
one
affair
and
they
often
fail
therein
through
negligence
or
malice
god
object
has
in
it
something
infinite
his
cares
embrace
the
universe
what
we
know
thereof
is
almost
nothing
and
we
desire
to
gauge
his
wisdom
and
his
goodness
by
our
knowledge
what
temerity
or
rather
what
absurdity
the
objections
are
on
false
assumptions
it
is
senseless
to
pass
judgement
on
the
point
of
law
when
one
does
not
know
the
matter
of
fact
to
say
with
paul
altitudo
divitiarum
et
sapientiae
is
not
renouncing
reason
it
is
rather
employing
the
reasons
that
we
know
for
they
teach
us
that
immensity
of
god
whereof
the
apostle
speaks
but
therein
we
confess
our
ignorance
of
the
facts
and
we
acknowledge
moreover
before
we
see
it
that
god
does
all
the
best
possible
in
accordance
with
the
infinite
wisdom
which
guides
his
actions
it
is
true
that
we
have
already
before
our
eyes
proofs
and
tests
of
this
when
we
see
something
entire
some
whole
complete
in
itself
and
isolated
so
to
speak
among
the
works
of
god
such
a
whole
shaped
as
it
were
by
the
hand
of
god
is
a
plant
an
animal
a
man
we
can
not
wonder
enough
at
the
beauty
and
the
contrivance
of
its
structure
but
when
we
see
some
broken
bone
some
piece
of
animal
flesh
some
sprig
of
a
plant
there
appears
to
be
nothing
but
confusion
unless
an
excellent
anatomist
observe
it
and
even
he
would
recognize
nothing
therein
if
he
had
not
before
seen
like
pieces
attached
to
their
whole
it
is
the
same
with
the
government
of
god
that
which
we
have
been
able
to
see
hitherto
is
not
a
large
enough
piece
for
recognition
of
the
beauty
and
the
order
of
the
whole
thus
the
very
nature
of
things
implies
that
this
order
in
the
divine
city
which
we
see
not
yet
here
on
earth
should
be
an
object
of
our
faith
of
our
hope
of
our
confidence
in
god
if
there
are
any
who
think
otherwise
so
much
the
worse
for
them
they
are
malcontents
in
the
state
of
the
greatest
and
the
best
of
all
monarchs
and
they
are
wrong
not
to
take
advantage
of
the
examples
he
has
given
them
of
his
wisdom
and
his
infinite
goodness
whereby
he
reveals
himself
as
being
not
only
wonderful
but
also
worthy
of
love
beyond
all
things
i
hope
it
will
be
found
that
nothing
of
what
is
comprised
in
the
nineteen
maxims
of
bayle
which
we
have
just
considered
has
been
left
without
a
necessary
answer
it
is
likely
that
having
often
before
meditated
on
this
subject
he
will
have
put
there
all
his
strongest
convictions
touching
the
moral
cause
of
moral
evil
there
are
however
still
sundry
passages
here
and
there
in
his
works
which
it
will
be
well
not
to
pass
over
in
silence
very
often
he
exaggerates
the
difficulty
which
he
assumes
with
regard
to
freeing
god
from
the
imputation
of
sin
he
observes
reply
to
the
questions
of
a
ch
that
molina
if
he
reconciled
free
will
with
foreknowledge
did
not
reconcile
the
goodness
and
the
holiness
of
god
with
sin
he
praises
the
sincerity
of
those
who
bluntly
declare
as
he
claims
piscator
did
that
everything
is
to
be
traced
back
to
the
will
of
god
and
who
maintain
that
god
could
not
but
be
just
even
though
he
were
the
author
of
sin
even
though
he
condemned
innocence
and
on
the
other
side
or
in
other
passages
he
seems
to
show
more
approval
of
the
opinions
of
those
who
preserve
god
goodness
at
the
expense
of
his
greatness
as
plutarch
does
in
his
book
against
the
stoics
was
more
reasonable
he
says
say
with
the
epicureans
innumerable
parts
or
atoms
flying
about
at
haphazard
through
an
infinite
space
their
force
prevailed
over
the
weakness
of
jupiter
and
in
spite
of
him
and
against
his
nature
and
will
did
many
bad
and
irrational
things
than
to
agree
that
there
is
neither
confusion
nor
wickedness
but
he
is
the
author
thereof
what
may
be
said
for
both
these
parties
stoics
and
epicureans
appears
to
have
led
bayle
to
the
greek
epechein
of
the
pyrrhonians
the
suspension
of
his
judgement
in
respect
of
reason
so
long
as
faith
is
set
apart
and
to
that
he
professes
sincere
submission
pursuing
his
arguments
however
he
has
gone
as
far
as
attempting
almost
to
revive
and
reinforce
those
of
the
disciples
of
manes
a
persian
heretic
of
the
third
century
after
christ
or
of
a
certain
paul
chief
of
the
manichaeans
in
armenia
in
the
seventh
century
from
whom
they
were
named
paulicians
all
these
heretics
renewed
what
an
ancient
philosopher
of
upper
asia
known
under
the
name
of
zoroaster
had
taught
so
it
is
said
of
two
intelligent
principles
of
all
things
the
one
good
the
other
bad
a
dogma
that
had
perhaps
come
from
the
indians
among
them
numbers
of
people
still
cling
to
their
error
one
that
is
exceedingly
prone
to
overtake
human
ignorance
and
superstition
since
very
many
barbarous
peoples
even
in
america
have
been
deluded
by
it
without
having
had
need
of
philosophy
the
slavs
according
to
helmold
had
their
zernebog
or
black
god
the
greeks
and
romans
wise
as
they
seem
to
be
had
a
vejovis
or
otherwise
called
pluto
and
numerous
other
maleficent
divinities
the
goddess
nemesis
took
pleasure
in
abasing
those
who
were
too
fortunate
and
herodotus
in
some
passages
hints
at
his
belief
that
all
divinity
is
envious
which
however
is
not
in
harmony
with
the
doctrine
of
the
two
principles
plutarch
in
his
treatise
isis
and
knows
of
no
writer
more
ancient
than
zoroaster
the
magician
as
he
calls
him
that
is
likely
to
have
taught
the
two
principles
trogus
or
justin
makes
him
a
king
of
the
bactrians
who
was
conquered
by
ninus
or
semiramis
he
attributes
to
him
the
knowledge
of
astronomy
and
the
invention
of
magic
but
this
magic
was
apparently
the
religion
of
the
and
it
appears
that
he
looked
upon
light
and
heat
as
the
good
principle
while
he
added
the
evil
that
is
to
say
opacity
darkness
cold
pliny
cites
the
testimony
of
a
certain
hermippus
an
interpreter
of
zoroaster
books
according
to
whom
zoroaster
was
a
disciple
in
the
art
of
magic
to
one
named
azonacus
unless
indeed
this
be
a
corruption
of
oromases
of
whom
i
shall
speak
presently
and
whom
plato
in
the
names
as
the
father
of
zoroaster
modern
orientals
give
the
name
zerdust
to
him
whom
the
greeks
named
zoroaster
he
is
regarded
as
corresponding
to
mercury
because
with
some
nations
wednesday
mercredi
takes
its
name
from
him
it
is
difficult
to
disentangle
the
story
of
zoroaster
and
know
exactly
when
he
lived
suidas
puts
him
five
hundred
years
before
the
taking
of
troy
some
ancients
cited
by
pliny
and
plutarch
took
it
to
be
ten
times
as
far
back
but
xanthus
the
lydian
in
the
preface
to
diogenes
laertius
put
him
only
six
hundred
years
before
the
expedition
of
xerxes
plato
declares
in
the
same
passage
as
bayle
observes
that
the
magic
of
zoroaster
was
nothing
but
the
study
of
religion
hyde
in
his
book
on
the
religion
of
the
ancient
persians
tries
to
justify
this
magic
and
to
clear
it
not
only
of
the
crime
of
impiety
but
also
of
idolatry
prevailed
among
the
persians
and
the
chaldaeans
also
it
is
thought
that
abraham
left
it
when
he
departed
from
ur
of
the
chaldees
mithras
was
the
sun
and
he
was
also
the
god
of
the
persians
and
according
to
ovid
account
horses
were
offered
in
sacrifice
to
him
equo
persis
radiis
hyperiona
cinctum
detur
celeri
victima
tarda
but
hyde
believes
that
they
only
made
use
of
the
sun
and
fire
in
their
worship
as
symbols
of
the
divinity
it
may
be
necessary
to
distinguish
as
elsewhere
between
the
wise
and
the
multitude
there
are
in
the
splendid
ruins
of
persepolis
or
of
tschelminaar
which
means
forty
columns
sculptured
representations
of
their
ceremonies
an
ambassador
of
holland
had
had
them
sketched
at
very
great
cost
by
a
painter
who
had
devoted
a
considerable
time
to
the
task
but
by
some
chance
or
other
these
sketches
fell
into
the
hands
of
a
traveller
chardin
according
to
what
he
tells
us
himself
it
would
be
a
pity
if
they
were
lost
these
ruins
are
one
of
the
most
ancient
and
most
beautiful
monuments
of
the
earth
and
in
this
respect
i
wonder
at
such
lack
of
curiosity
in
a
century
so
curious
as
ours
the
ancient
greeks
and
the
modern
orientals
agree
in
saying
that
zoroaster
called
the
good
god
oromazes
or
rather
oromasdes
and
the
evil
god
arimanius
when
i
pondered
on
the
fact
that
great
princes
of
upper
asia
had
the
name
of
hormisdas
and
that
irminius
or
herminius
was
the
name
of
a
god
or
ancient
hero
of
the
scythian
celts
that
is
of
the
germani
it
occurred
to
me
that
this
arimanius
or
irminius
might
have
been
a
great
conqueror
of
very
ancient
time
coming
from
the
west
just
as
genghis
khan
and
tamburlaine
were
later
coming
from
the
east
arimanius
would
therefore
have
come
from
the
that
is
from
germania
and
sarmatia
through
the
territory
of
the
alani
and
massagetae
to
raid
the
dominions
of
one
ormisdas
a
great
king
in
upper
asia
just
as
other
scythians
did
in
the
days
of
cyaxares
king
of
the
medes
according
to
the
account
given
by
herodotus
the
monarch
governing
civilized
peoples
and
working
to
defend
them
against
the
barbarians
would
have
gone
down
to
posterity
amongst
the
same
peoples
as
the
good
god
but
the
chief
of
these
devastators
will
have
become
the
symbol
of
the
evil
principle
that
is
altogether
reasonable
it
appears
from
this
same
mythology
that
these
two
princes
contended
for
long
but
that
neither
of
them
was
victorious
thus
they
both
held
their
own
just
as
the
two
principles
shared
the
empire
of
the
world
according
to
the
hypothesis
attributed
to
zoroaster
it
remains
to
be
proved
that
an
ancient
god
or
hero
of
the
germani
was
called
herman
arimanius
or
irminius
tacitus
relates
that
the
three
tribes
which
composed
germania
the
ingaevones
the
istaevones
and
the
herminones
or
hermiones
were
thus
named
from
the
three
sons
of
mannus
whether
that
be
true
or
not
he
wished
in
any
case
to
indicate
that
there
was
a
hero
named
herminius
from
whom
he
was
told
the
herminones
were
named
herminones
hermenner
hermunduri
all
mean
the
same
that
is
soldiers
even
in
the
dark
ages
arimanni
were
militares
and
there
is
in
lombard
law
i
have
shown
elsewhere
that
apparently
the
name
of
one
part
of
germania
was
given
to
the
whole
and
that
from
these
herminones
or
hermunduri
all
the
teutonic
peoples
were
named
or
the
difference
between
these
two
words
is
only
in
the
force
of
the
aspiration
there
is
the
same
difference
of
initial
letter
between
the
of
the
latins
and
of
the
spaniards
or
in
the
of
the
latins
and
the
that
is
marine
crayfish
of
the
low
germans
besides
it
is
very
usual
for
one
part
of
a
nation
to
give
the
name
to
the
whole
so
all
the
germani
were
called
alemanni
by
the
french
and
yet
this
according
to
the
old
nomenclature
only
applied
to
the
suabians
and
the
swiss
although
tacitus
did
not
actually
know
the
origin
of
the
name
of
the
germani
he
said
something
which
supports
my
opinion
when
he
observed
that
it
was
a
name
which
inspired
terror
taken
or
given
in
fact
it
signifies
a
warrior
is
army
whence
comes
or
to
haro
that
is
a
general
order
to
be
with
the
army
since
corrupted
into
thus
hariman
or
ariman
german
is
a
soldier
for
as
means
army
so
signifies
arms
to
fight
to
make
war
the
word
coming
doubtless
from
the
same
source
i
have
already
spoken
of
the
not
only
did
herminones
or
germani
signify
the
same
but
also
that
ancient
herman
son
of
mannus
appears
to
have
been
given
this
name
as
being
a
warrior
now
it
is
not
the
passage
in
tacitus
only
which
indicates
for
us
this
god
or
hero
we
can
not
doubt
the
existence
of
one
of
this
name
among
these
peoples
since
charlemagne
found
and
destroyed
near
the
weser
the
column
called
erected
in
honour
of
this
god
and
that
combined
with
the
passage
in
tacitus
leaves
us
with
the
conclusion
that
it
was
not
that
famous
arminius
who
was
an
enemy
of
the
romans
but
a
much
greater
and
more
ancient
hero
that
this
cult
concerned
arminius
bore
the
same
name
as
those
who
are
called
hermann
arminius
was
not
great
enough
nor
fortunate
enough
nor
well
enough
known
throughout
germania
to
attain
to
the
honour
of
a
public
cult
even
at
the
hands
of
remote
tribes
like
the
saxons
who
came
long
after
him
into
the
country
of
the
cherusci
and
our
arminius
taken
by
the
asiatics
for
the
evil
god
provides
ample
confirmation
of
my
opinion
for
in
these
matters
conjectures
confirm
one
another
without
any
logical
circle
when
their
foundations
tend
towards
one
and
the
same
end
it
is
not
beyond
belief
that
the
hermes
that
is
mercury
of
the
greeks
is
the
same
herminius
or
arimanius
he
may
have
been
an
inventor
or
promoter
of
the
arts
and
of
a
slightly
more
civilized
life
among
his
own
people
and
in
the
countries
where
he
held
supremacy
while
amongst
his
enemies
he
was
looked
upon
as
the
author
of
confusion
who
knows
but
that
he
may
have
penetrated
even
into
egypt
like
the
scythians
who
in
pursuit
of
sesostris
came
nearly
so
far
theut
menes
and
hermes
were
known
and
revered
in
egypt
they
might
have
been
tuiscon
his
son
mannus
and
herman
son
of
mannus
according
to
the
genealogy
of
tacitus
menes
is
held
to
be
the
most
ancient
king
of
the
egyptians
was
with
them
a
name
for
mercury
at
least
theut
or
tuiscon
from
whom
tacitus
derives
the
descent
of
the
germani
and
from
whom
the
teutons
that
is
germani
even
have
their
name
is
the
same
as
that
who
according
to
lucan
was
worshipped
by
the
gauls
and
whom
caesar
took
dite
for
pluto
because
of
the
resemblance
between
his
latin
name
and
that
of
or
this
in
ancient
times
signified
men
people
and
also
an
excellent
man
like
the
word
in
short
a
prince
there
are
authorities
for
all
these
significations
but
one
must
not
delay
over
this
point
herr
otto
sperling
who
is
well
known
for
various
learned
writings
but
has
many
more
in
readiness
to
appear
in
a
special
dissertation
has
treated
the
question
of
this
teutates
god
of
the
celts
some
observations
which
i
imparted
to
him
on
that
subject
have
been
published
with
his
reply
in
the
news
of
the
baltic
he
interprets
this
passage
from
lucan
somewhat
otherwise
than
i
do
pollensque
feris
altaribus
hesus
tamaris
scythicae
non
mitior
ara
hesus
was
it
appears
the
god
of
war
who
was
called
ares
by
the
greeks
and
erich
by
the
ancient
germani
whence
still
remains
tuesday
the
letters
r
and
s
which
are
produced
by
the
same
organ
are
easily
interchanged
for
instance
and
and
and
likewise
instead
of
with
the
ancient
romans
as
for
taramis
or
perhaps
taranis
one
knows
that
was
the
thunder
or
the
god
of
thunder
with
the
ancient
celts
called
by
the
germani
of
the
north
whence
the
english
have
preserved
the
name
and
the
passage
from
lucan
means
that
the
altar
of
taran
god
of
the
celts
was
not
less
cruel
than
that
of
diana
in
tauris
aram
non
mitiorem
ara
dianae
scythicae
it
is
also
not
impossible
that
there
was
a
time
when
the
western
or
celtic
princes
made
themselves
masters
of
greece
of
egypt
and
a
good
part
of
asia
and
that
their
cult
remained
in
those
countries
when
one
considers
with
what
rapidity
the
huns
the
saracens
and
the
tartars
gained
possession
of
a
great
part
of
our
continent
one
will
be
the
less
surprised
at
this
and
it
is
confirmed
by
the
great
number
of
words
in
the
greek
and
german
tongues
which
correspond
so
closely
callimachus
in
a
hymn
in
honour
of
apollo
seems
to
imply
that
the
celts
who
attacked
the
temple
at
delphi
under
their
brennus
or
chief
were
descendants
of
the
ancient
titans
and
giants
who
made
war
on
jupiter
and
the
other
gods
that
is
to
say
on
the
princes
of
asia
and
of
greece
it
may
be
that
jupiter
is
himself
descended
from
the
titans
or
theodons
that
is
from
the
earlier
princes
and
the
material
collected
by
the
late
abbé
de
la
charmoye
in
his
conforms
to
that
possibility
yet
there
are
opinions
on
other
matters
in
this
work
by
this
learned
writer
which
to
me
do
not
appear
probable
especially
when
he
excludes
the
germani
from
the
number
of
the
celts
not
having
recalled
sufficiently
the
facts
given
by
ancient
writers
and
not
being
sufficiently
aware
of
the
relation
between
the
ancient
gallic
and
germanic
tongues
now
the
giants
who
wished
to
scale
the
heavens
were
new
celts
who
followed
the
path
of
their
ancestors
and
jupiter
although
of
their
kindred
as
it
were
was
constrained
to
resist
them
just
so
did
the
visigoths
established
in
gallic
territory
resist
together
with
the
romans
other
peoples
of
germania
and
scythia
who
succeeded
them
under
attila
their
leader
he
being
at
that
time
in
control
of
the
scythian
sarmatic
and
germanic
tribes
from
the
frontiers
of
persia
up
to
the
rhine
but
the
pleasure
one
feels
when
one
thinks
to
find
in
the
mythologies
of
the
gods
some
trace
of
the
old
history
of
fabulous
times
has
perhaps
carried
me
too
far
and
i
know
not
whether
i
shall
have
been
any
more
successful
than
goropius
becanus
schrieckius
herr
rudbeck
and
the
abbe
de
la
charmoye
let
us
return
to
zoroaster
who
led
us
to
oromasdes
and
arimanius
the
sources
of
good
and
evil
and
let
us
assume
that
he
looked
upon
them
as
two
eternal
principles
opposed
to
each
other
although
there
is
reason
to
doubt
this
assumption
it
is
thought
that
marcion
disciple
of
cerdon
was
of
this
opinion
before
manes
bayle
acknowledges
that
these
men
used
lamentable
arguments
but
he
thinks
that
they
did
not
sufficiently
recognize
their
advantages
or
know
how
to
apply
their
principal
instrument
which
was
the
difficulty
over
the
origin
of
evil
he
believes
that
an
able
man
on
their
side
would
have
thoroughly
embarrassed
the
orthodox
and
it
seems
as
though
he
himself
failing
any
other
wished
to
undertake
a
task
so
unnecessary
in
the
opinion
of
many
people
the
hypotheses
he
says
christians
have
established
parry
but
poorly
the
blows
aimed
at
them
they
all
triumph
when
they
act
on
the
offensive
but
they
lose
their
whole
advantage
when
they
have
to
sustain
the
attack
he
confesses
that
the
as
with
hyde
he
calls
them
that
is
the
champions
of
two
principles
would
soon
have
been
routed
by
reasons
taken
from
the
nature
of
god
but
he
thinks
that
they
triumph
in
their
turn
when
one
comes
to
the
reasons
which
are
taken
from
the
existence
of
evil
he
treats
of
the
matter
with
abundant
detail
in
his
article
which
we
must
examine
a
little
in
order
to
throw
greater
light
upon
this
subject
surest
and
clearest
ideas
of
order
teach
us
he
says
a
being
who
exists
through
himself
who
is
necessary
who
is
eternal
must
be
single
infinite
all
powerful
and
endowed
with
all
kinds
of
perfections
this
argument
deserves
to
have
been
developed
more
completely
it
is
necessary
to
see
he
goes
on
the
phenomena
of
nature
can
be
conveniently
explained
by
the
hypothesis
of
one
single
principle
i
have
explained
it
sufficiently
by
showing
that
there
are
cases
where
some
disorder
in
the
part
is
necessary
for
producing
the
greatest
order
in
the
whole
but
it
appears
that
bayle
asks
a
little
too
much
he
wishes
for
a
detailed
exposition
of
how
evil
is
connected
with
the
best
possible
scheme
for
the
universe
that
would
be
a
complete
explanation
of
the
phenomena
but
i
do
not
undertake
to
give
it
nor
am
i
bound
to
do
so
for
there
is
no
obligation
to
do
that
which
is
impossible
for
us
in
our
existing
state
it
is
sufficient
for
me
to
point
out
that
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
the
connexion
of
a
certain
individual
evil
with
what
is
the
best
on
the
whole
this
incomplete
explanation
leaving
something
to
be
discovered
in
the
life
to
come
is
sufficient
for
answering
the
objections
though
not
for
a
comprehension
of
the
matter
heavens
and
all
the
rest
of
the
universe
adds
bayle
the
glory
the
power
the
oneness
of
god
thence
the
conclusion
should
have
been
drawn
that
this
is
the
case
as
i
have
already
observed
above
because
there
is
seen
in
these
objects
something
entire
and
isolated
so
to
speak
every
time
we
see
such
a
work
of
god
we
find
it
so
perfect
that
we
must
wonder
at
the
contrivance
and
the
beauty
thereof
but
when
we
do
not
see
an
entire
work
when
we
only
look
upon
scraps
and
fragments
it
is
no
wonder
if
the
good
order
is
not
evident
there
our
planetary
system
composes
such
an
isolated
work
which
is
complete
also
when
it
is
taken
by
itself
each
plant
each
animal
each
man
furnishes
one
such
work
to
a
certain
point
of
perfection
one
recognizes
therein
the
wonderful
contrivance
of
the
author
but
the
human
kind
so
far
as
it
is
known
to
us
is
only
a
fragment
only
a
small
portion
of
the
city
of
god
or
of
the
republic
of
spirits
which
has
an
extent
too
great
for
us
and
whereof
we
know
too
little
to
be
able
to
observe
the
wonderful
order
therein
alone
says
bayle
masterpiece
of
his
creator
among
things
visible
man
alone
i
say
gives
rise
to
great
objections
with
regard
to
the
oneness
of
god
claudian
made
the
same
observation
unburdening
his
heart
in
these
lines
mihi
dubiam
traxit
sententia
etc
but
the
harmony
existing
in
all
the
rest
allows
of
a
strong
presumption
that
it
would
exist
also
in
the
government
of
men
and
generally
in
that
of
spirits
if
the
whole
were
known
to
us
one
must
judge
the
works
of
god
as
wisely
as
socrates
judged
those
of
heraclitus
in
these
words
what
i
have
understood
thereof
pleases
me
i
think
that
the
rest
would
please
me
no
less
if
i
understood
it
here
is
another
particular
reason
for
the
disorder
apparent
in
that
which
concerns
man
it
is
that
god
in
giving
him
intelligence
has
presented
him
with
an
image
of
the
divinity
he
leaves
him
to
himself
in
a
sense
in
his
small
department
spartam
quam
nactus
est
he
enters
there
only
in
a
secret
way
for
he
supplies
being
force
life
reason
without
showing
himself
it
is
there
that
free
will
plays
its
game
and
god
makes
game
so
to
speak
of
these
little
gods
that
he
has
thought
good
to
produce
as
we
make
game
of
children
who
follow
pursuits
which
we
secretly
encourage
or
hinder
according
as
it
pleases
us
thus
man
is
there
like
a
little
god
in
his
own
world
or
which
he
governs
after
his
own
fashion
he
sometimes
performs
wonders
therein
and
his
art
often
imitates
nature
in
parvo
cum

but
he
also
commits
great
errors
because
he
abandons
himself
to
the
passions
and
because
god
abandons
him
to
his
own
way
god
punishes
him
also
for
such
errors
now
like
a
father
or
tutor
training
or
chastising
children
now
like
a
just
judge
punishing
those
who
forsake
him
and
evil
comes
to
pass
most
frequently
when
these
intelligences
or
their
small
worlds
come
into
collision
man
finds
himself
the
worse
for
this
in
proportion
to
his
fault
but
god
by
a
wonderful
art
turns
all
the
errors
of
these
little
worlds
to
the
greater
adornment
of
his
great
world
it
is
as
in
those
devices
of
perspective
where
certain
beautiful
designs
look
like
mere
confusion
until
one
restores
them
to
the
right
angle
of
vision
or
one
views
them
by
means
of
a
certain
glass
or
mirror
it
is
by
placing
and
using
them
properly
that
one
makes
them
serve
as
adornment
for
a
room
thus
the
apparent
deformities
of
our
little
worlds
combine
to
become
beauties
in
the
great
world
and
have
nothing
in
them
which
is
opposed
to
the
oneness
of
an
infinitely
perfect
universal
principle
on
the
contrary
they
increase
our
wonder
at
the
wisdom
of
him
who
makes
evil
serve
the
greater
good
bayle
continues
man
is
wicked
and
miserable
that
there
are
everywhere
prisons
and
hospitals
that
history
is
simply
a
collection
of
the
crimes
and
calamities
of
the
human
race
i
think
that
there
is
exaggeration
in
that
there
is
incomparably
more
good
than
evil
in
the
life
of
men
as
there
are
incomparably
more
houses
than
prisons
with
regard
to
virtue
and
vice
a
certain
mediocrity
prevails
machiavelli
has
already
observed
that
there
are
few
very
wicked
and
very
good
men
and
that
this
causes
the
failure
of
many
great
enterprises
i
find
it
a
great
fault
in
historians
that
they
keep
their
mind
on
the
evil
more
than
on
the
good
the
chief
end
of
history
as
also
of
poetry
should
be
to
teach
prudence
and
virtue
by
examples
and
then
to
display
vice
in
such
a
way
as
to
create
aversion
to
it
and
to
prompt
men
to
avoid
it
or
serve
towards
that
end
bayle
avows
one
finds
everywhere
both
moral
good
and
physical
good
some
examples
of
virtue
some
examples
of
happiness
and
that
this
is
what
makes
the
difficulty
for
if
there
were
only
wicked
and
unhappy
people
he
says
would
be
no
need
to
resort
to
the
hypothesis
of
the
two
principles
i
wonder
that
this
admirable
man
could
have
evinced
so
great
an
inclination
towards
this
opinion
of
the
two
principles
and
i
am
surprised
at
his
not
having
taken
into
account
that
this
romance
of
human
life
which
makes
the
universal
history
of
the
human
race
lay
fully
devised
in
the
divine
understanding
with
innumerable
others
and
that
the
will
of
god
only
decreed
its
existence
because
this
sequence
of
events
was
to
be
most
in
keeping
with
the
rest
of
things
to
bring
forth
the
best
result
and
these
apparent
faults
in
the
whole
world
these
spots
on
a
sun
whereof
ours
is
but
a
ray
rather
enhance
its
beauty
than
diminish
it
contributing
towards
that
end
by
obtaining
a
greater
good
there
are
in
truth
two
principles
but
they
are
both
in
god
to
wit
his
understanding
and
his
will
the
understanding
furnishes
the
principle
of
evil
without
being
sullied
by
it
without
being
evil
it
represents
natures
as
they
exist
in
the
eternal
verities
it
contains
within
it
the
reason
wherefore
evil
is
permitted
but
the
will
tends
only
towards
good
let
us
add
a
third
principle
namely
power
it
precedes
even
understanding
and
will
but
it
operates
as
the
one
displays
it
and
as
the
other
requires
it
some
like
campanella
have
called
these
three
perfections
of
god
the
three
primordialities
many
have
even
believed
that
there
was
therein
a
secret
connexion
with
the
holy
trinity
that
power
relates
to
the
father
that
is
to
the
source
of
divinity
wisdom
to
the
eternal
word
which
is
called
by
the
most
sublime
of
the
evangelists
and
will
or
love
to
the
holy
spirit
all
the
expressions
or
comparisons
derived
from
the
nature
of
the
intelligent
substance
tend
that
way
it
seems
to
me
that
if
bayle
had
taken
into
account
what
i
have
just
said
of
the
principles
of
things
he
would
have
answered
his
own
questions
or
at
the
least
he
would
not
have
continued
to
ask
as
he
does
in
these
which
follow
man
is
the
work
of
a
single
principle
supremely
good
supremely
holy
supremely
powerful
can
he
be
subject
to
diseases
to
cold
heat
hunger
thirst
pain
grief
can
he
have
so
many
evil
tendencies
can
he
commit
so
many
crimes
can
supreme
goodness
produce
an
unhappy
creature
shall
not
supreme
power
united
to
an
infinite
goodness
shower
blessings
upon
its
work
and
shall
it
not
banish
all
that
might
offend
or
grieve
prudentius
in
his
presented
the

but
i
have
already
answered
that
sufficiently
man
is
himself
the
source
of
his
evils
just
as
he
is
he
was
in
the
divine
idea
god
prompted
by
essential
reasons
of
wisdom
decreed
that
he
should
pass
into
existence
just
as
he
is
bayle
would
perchance
have
perceived
this
origin
of
evil
in
the
form
in
which
i
demonstrate
it
here
if
he
had
herein
combined
the
wisdom
of
god
with
his
power
his
goodness
and
his
holiness
i
will
add
in
passing
that
his
is
nothing
other
than
the
highest
degree
of
goodness
just
as
the
crime
which
is
its
opposite
is
the
worst
of
all
evil
bayle
places
the
greek
philosopher
melissus
champion
of
the
oneness
of
the
first
principle
and
perhaps
even
of
the
oneness
of
substance
in
conflict
with
zoroaster
as
with
the
first
originator
of
duality
zoroaster
admits
that
the
hypothesis
of
melissus
is
more
consistent
with
order
and
reasons
but
he
denies
its
conformity
with
experience
and
reasons
surpass
you
he
said
the
explanation
of
phenomena
which
is
the
principal
mark
of
a
good
system
but
in
my
opinion
it
is
not
a
very
good
explanation
of
a
phenomenon
to
assign
to
it
an
principle
to
evil
a
to
cold
a
there
is
nothing
so
easy
and
nothing
so
dull
it
is
as
if
someone
were
to
say
that
the
peripatetics
surpass
the
new
mathematicians
in
the
explanation
of
the
phenomena
of
the
stars
by
giving
them
intelligences
to
guide
them
according
to
that
it
is
quite
easy
to
conceive
why
the
planets
make
their
way
with
such
precision
whereas
there
is
need
of
much
geometry
and
reflexion
to
understand
how
from
the
gravity
of
the
planets
which
bears
them
towards
the
sun
combined
with
some
whirlwind
which
carries
them
along
or
with
their
own
motive
force
can
spring
the
elliptic
movement
of
kepler
which
satisfies
appearances
so
well
a
man
incapable
of
relishing
deep
speculations
will
at
first
applaud
the
peripatetics
and
will
treat
our
mathematicians
as
dreamers
some
old
galenist
will
do
the
same
with
regard
to
the
faculties
of
the
schoolmen
he
will
admit
a
chylific
a
chymific
and
a
sanguific
and
he
will
assign
one
of
these
to
each
operation
he
will
think
he
has
worked
wonders
and
will
laugh
at
what
he
will
call
the
chimeras
of
the
moderns
who
claim
to
explain
through
mechanical
structure
what
passes
in
the
body
of
an
animal
the
explanation
of
the
cause
of
evil
by
a
particular
principle
principium
is
of
the
same
nature
evil
needs
no
such
explanation
any
more
than
do
cold
and
darkness
there
is
neither
nor
principle
of
darkness
evil
itself
comes
only
from
privation
the
positive
enters
therein
only
by
concomitance
as
the
active
enters
by
concomitance
into
cold
we
see
that
water
in
freezing
is
capable
of
breaking
a
wherein
it
is
confined
and
yet
cold
is
a
certain
privation
of
force
it
only
comes
from
the
diminution
of
a
movement
which
separates
the
particles
of
fluids
when
this
separating
motion
becomes
weakened
in
the
water
by
the
cold
the
particles
of
compressed
air
concealed
in
the
water
collect
and
becoming
larger
they
become
more
capable
of
acting
outwards
through
their
buoyancy
the
resistance
which
the
surfaces
of
the
proportions
of
air
meet
in
the
water
and
which
opposes
the
force
exerted
by
these
portions
towards
dilation
is
far
less
and
consequently
the
effect
of
the
air
greater
in
large
than
in
small
even
though
these
small
bubbles
combined
should
form
as
great
a
mass
as
the
large
for
the
resistances
that
is
the
surfaces
increase
by
the
and
the
forces
that
is
the
contents
or
the
volumes
of
the
spheres
of
compressed
air
increase
by
the
of
their
diameters
thus
it
is
that
privation
involves
action
and
force
i
have
already
shown
how
privation
is
enough
to
cause
error
and
malice
and
how
god
is
prompted
to
permit
them
despite
that
there
be
no
malignity
in
him
evil
comes
from
privation
the
positive
and
action
spring
from
it
by
accident
as
force
springs
from
cold
the
statement
that
bayle
attributes
to
the
paulicians
is
not
conclusive
to
wit
that
free
will
must
come
from
two
principles
to
the
end
that
it
may
have
power
to
turn
towards
good
and
towards
evil
for
being
simple
in
itself
it
should
rather
have
come
from
a
neutral
principle
if
this
argument
held
good
but
free
will
tends
towards
good
and
if
it
meets
with
evil
it
is
by
accident
for
the
reason
that
this
evil
is
concealed
beneath
the
good
and
masked
as
it
were
these
words
which
ovid
ascribes
to
medea
meliora
proboque
imply
that
the
morally
good
is
mastered
by
the
agreeably
good
which
makes
more
impression
on
souls
when
they
are
disturbed
by
the
passions
furthermore
bayle
himself
supplies
melissus
with
a
good
answer
but
a
little
later
he
disputes
it
here
are
his
words
melissus
consults
the
notions
of
order
he
will
answer
that
man
was
not
wicked
when
god
made
him
he
will
say
that
man
received
from
god
a
happy
state
but
that
not
having
followed
the
light
of
conscience
which
in
accordance
with
the
intention
of
its
author
should
have
guided
him
along
the
path
of
virtue
he
has
become
wicked
and
has
deserved
that
god
the
supremely
good
should
make
him
feel
the
effects
of
his
anger
it
is
therefore
not
god
who
is
the
cause
of
moral
evil
but
he
is
the
cause
of
physical
evil
that
is
of
the
punishment
of
moral
evil
and
this
punishment
far
from
being
incompatible
with
the
supremely
good
principle
of
necessity
emanates
from
that
one
of
its
attributes
i
mean
its
justice
which
is
not
less
essential
to
it
than
its
goodness
this
answer
the
most
reasonable
that
melissus
can
give
is
fundamentally
good
and
sound
but
it
may
be
disputed
by
something
more
specious
and
more
dazzling
for
indeed
zoroaster
objects
that
the
infinitely
good
principle
ought
to
have
created
man
not
only
without
actual
evil
but
also
without
the
inclination
towards
evil
that
god
having
foreseen
sin
with
all
its
consequences
ought
to
have
prevented
it
that
he
ought
to
have
impelled
man
to
moral
good
and
not
to
have
allowed
him
any
force
for
tending
towards
crime
that
is
quite
easy
to
say
but
it
is
not
practicable
if
one
follows
the
principles
of
order
it
could
not
have
been
accomplished
without
perpetual
miracles
ignorance
error
and
malice
follow
one
another
naturally
in
animals
made
as
we
are
should
this
species
then
have
been
missing
in
the
universe
i
have
no
doubt
but
that
it
is
too
important
there
despite
all
its
weaknesses
for
god
to
have
consented
to
its
abolition
bayle
in
the
article
entitled
inserted
by
him
in
his
follows
up
the
pronouncements
he
made
in
the
article
on
the
manichaeans
according
to
him
lit
h
the
orthodox
seem
to
admit
two
first
principles
in
making
the
devil
the
originator
of
sin
becker
a
former
minister
of
amsterdam
author
of
the
book
entitled
world
has
made
use
of
this
idea
in
order
to
demonstrate
that
one
should
not
assign
such
power
and
authority
to
the
devil
as
would
allow
of
his
comparison
with
god
therein
he
is
right
but
he
pushes
the
conclusions
too
far
and
the
author
of
the
book
entitled
greek
apokatastasis
pantôn
believes
that
if
the
devil
had
never
been
vanquished
and
despoiled
if
he
had
always
kept
his
prey
if
the
title
of
invincible
had
belonged
to
him
that
would
have
done
injury
to
the
glory
of
god
but
it
is
a
poor
advantage
to
keep
those
whom
one
has
led
astray
in
order
to
share
their
punishment
for
ever
and
as
for
the
cause
of
evil
it
is
true
that
the
devil
is
the
author
of
sin
but
the
origin
of
sin
comes
from
farther
away
its
source
is
in
the
original
imperfection
of
creatures
that
renders
them
capable
of
sinning
and
there
are
circumstances
in
the
sequence
of
things
which
cause
this
power
to
evince
itself
in
action
the
devils
were
angels
like
the
rest
before
their
fall
and
it
is
thought
that
their
leader
was
one
of
the
chief
among
angels
but
scripture
is
not
explicit
enough
on
that
point
the
passage
of
the
apocalypse
that
speaks
of
the
struggle
with
the
dragon
as
of
a
vision
leaves
much
in
doubt
and
does
not
sufficiently
develop
a
subject
which
by
the
other
sacred
writers
is
hardly
mentioned
it
is
not
in
place
here
to
enter
into
this
discussion
and
one
must
still
admit
that
the
common
opinion
agrees
best
with
the
sacred
text
bayle
examines
some
replies
of
st
basil
of
lactantius
and
others
on
the
origin
of
evil
as
however
they
are
concerned
with
physical
evil
i
postpone
discussion
thereof
and
i
will
proceed
with
the
examination
of
the
difficulties
over
the
moral
cause
of
moral
evil
which
arise
in
several
passages
of
the
works
of
our
gifted
author
he
disputes
the
of
this
evil
he
would
wish
one
to
admit
that
god
it
he
quotes
these
words
of
calvin
on
genesis
ch
ears
of
some
are
offended
when
one
says
that
god
willed
it
but
i
ask
you
what
else
is
the
permission
of
him
who
is
entitled
to
forbid
or
rather
who
has
the
thing
in
his
own
hands
but
an
act
of
will
bayle
explains
these
words
of
calvin
and
those
which
precede
them
as
if
he
admitted
that
god
willed
the
fall
of
adam
not
in
so
far
as
it
was
a
crime
but
under
some
other
conception
that
is
unknown
to
us
he
quotes
casuists
who
are
somewhat
lax
who
say
that
a
son
can
desire
the
death
of
his
father
not
in
so
far
as
it
is
an
evil
for
himself
but
in
so
far
as
it
is
a
good
for
his
heirs
reply
to
the
questions
of
a
ch
it
seems
to
me
that
calvin
only
says
that
god
willed
man
fall
for
some
reason
unknown
to
us
in
the
main
when
it
is
a
question
of
a
decisive
will
that
is
of
a
decree
these
distinctions
are
useless
one
wills
the
action
with
all
its
qualities
if
it
is
true
that
one
wills
it
but
when
it
is
a
crime
god
can
only
will
the
permission
of
it
the
crime
is
neither
an
end
nor
a
means
it
is
only
a
sine
qua
thus
it
is
not
the
object
of
a
direct
will
as
i
have
already
demonstrated
above
god
can
not
prevent
it
without
acting
against
what
he
owes
to
himself
without
doing
something
that
would
be
worse
than
the
crime
of
man
without
violating
the
rule
of
the
best
and
that
would
be
to
destroy
divinity
as
i
have
already
observed
god
is
therefore
bound
by
a
moral
necessity
which
is
in
himself
to
permit
moral
evil
in
creatures
there
is
precisely
the
case
wherein
the
will
of
a
wise
mind
is
only
permissive
i
have
already
said
this
he
is
bound
to
permit
the
crime
of
others
when
he
can
not
prevent
it
without
himself
failing
in
that
which
he
owes
to
himself
among
all
these
infinite
combinations
says
bayle
pleased
god
to
choose
one
wherein
adam
was
to
sin
and
by
his
decree
he
made
it
in
preference
to
all
the
others
the
plan
that
should
come
to
pass
very
good
that
is
speaking
my
language
so
long
as
one
applies
it
to
the
combinations
which
compose
the
whole
universe
will
therefore
never
make
us
understand
he
adds
god
did
not
will
that
eve
and
adam
should
sin
since
he
rejected
all
the
combinations
wherein
they
would
not
have
sinned
but
the
thing
is
in
general
very
easy
to
understand
from
all
that
i
have
just
said
this
combination
that
makes
the
whole
universe
is
the
best
god
therefore
could
not
refrain
from
choosing
it
without
incurring
a
lapse
and
rather
than
incur
such
a
thing
altogether
inappropriate
to
him
he
permits
the
lapse
or
the
sin
of
man
which
is
involved
in
this
combination
jacquelot
with
other
able
men
does
not
differ
in
opinion
from
me
when
for
example
he
says
of
his
treatise
on
the
of
faith
with
who
are
puzzled
by
these
difficulties
seem
to
be
too
limited
in
their
outlook
and
to
wish
to
reduce
all
god
designs
to
their
own
interests
when
god
formed
the
universe
his
whole
prospect
was
himself
and
his
own
glory
so
that
if
we
had
knowledge
of
all
creatures
of
their
diverse
combinations
and
of
their
different
relations
we
should
understand
without
difficulty
that
the
universe
corresponds
perfectly
to
the
infinite
wisdom
of
the
almighty
he
says
elsewhere
the
impossible
that
god
could
not
prevent
the
wrong
use
of
free
will
without
destroying
it
it
will
be
agreed
that
since
his
wisdom
and
his
glory
determined
him
to
form
free
creatures
this
powerful
reason
must
have
prevailed
over
the
grievous
consequences
which
their
freedom
might
have
i
have
endeavoured
to
develop
this
still
further
through
reason
of
the
best
and
the
moral
which
led
god
to
make
this
choice
despite
the
sin
of
some
creatures
which
is
involved
therein
i
think
that
i
have
cut
down
to
the
root
of
the
difficulty
nevertheless
i
am
well
pleased
for
the
sake
of
throwing
more
light
on
the
matter
to
apply
my
principle
of
solution
to
the
peculiar
difficulties
of
bayle
here
is
one
set
forth
in
these
terms
ch
it
in
a
prince
be
a
mark
of
his
kindness
to
give
to
a
hundred
messengers
as
much
money
as
is
needed
for
a
journey
of
two
hundred
leagues
to
promise
a
recompense
to
all
those
who
should
finish
the
journey
without
having
borrowed
anything
and
to
threaten
with
imprisonment
all
those
whom
their
money
should
not
have
sufficed
to
make
choice
of
a
hundred
persons
of
whom
he
would
know
for
certain
that
there
were
but
two
who
should
earn
the
recompense
the
others
being
destined
to
find
on
the
way
either
a
mistress
or
a
gamester
or
some
other
thing
which
would
make
them
incur
expenses
and
which
he
would
himself
have
been
at
pains
to
dispose
in
certain
places
along
their
path
to
imprison
actually
of
these
messengers
on
the
moment
of
their
return
is
it
not
abundantly
evident
that
he
would
have
no
kindness
for
them
and
that
on
the
contrary
he
would
intend
for
them
not
the
proposed
recompense
but
prison
they
would
deserve
it
certainly
but
he
who
had
wished
them
to
deserve
it
and
placed
them
in
the
sure
way
towards
deserving
it
should
he
be
worthy
of
being
called
kind
on
the
pretext
that
he
had
recompensed
the
two
others
it
would
doubtless
not
be
on
that
account
that
he
earned
the
title
of
yet
other
circumstances
may
contribute
which
would
avail
to
render
him
worthy
of
praise
for
having
employed
this
artifice
in
order
to
know
those
people
and
to
make
trial
of
them
just
as
gideon
made
use
of
some
extraordinary
means
of
choosing
the
most
valiant
and
the
least
squeamish
among
his
soldiers
and
even
if
the
prince
were
to
know
already
the
disposition
of
all
these
messengers
may
he
not
put
them
to
this
test
in
order
to
make
them
known
also
to
the
others
even
though
these
reasons
be
not
applicable
to
god
they
make
it
clear
nevertheless
that
an
action
like
that
of
this
prince
may
appear
preposterous
when
it
is
detached
from
the
circumstances
indicating
its
cause
all
the
more
must
one
deem
that
god
has
acted
well
and
that
we
should
see
this
if
we
fully
knew
of
all
that
he
has
done
descartes
in
a
letter
to
the
princess
elizabeth
vol
letter
has
made
use
of
another
comparison
to
reconcile
human
freedom
with
the
omnipotence
of
god
imagines
a
monarch
who
has
forbidden
duels
and
who
knowing
for
certain
that
two
noblemen
if
they
meet
will
fight
takes
sure
steps
to
bring
about
their
meeting
they
meet
indeed
they
fight
their
disobedience
of
the
law
is
an
effect
of
their
free
will
they
are
punishable
what
a
king
can
do
in
such
a
case
he
adds
concerning
some
free
actions
of
his
subjects
god
who
has
infinite
foreknowledge
and
power
certainly
does
concerning
all
those
of
men
before
he
sent
us
into
this
world
he
knew
exactly
what
all
the
tendencies
of
our
will
would
be
he
has
endued
us
therewith
he
also
has
disposed
all
other
things
that
are
outside
us
to
cause
such
and
such
objects
to
present
themselves
to
our
senses
at
such
and
such
a
time
he
knew
that
as
a
result
of
this
our
free
will
would
determine
us
toward
some
particular
thing
and
he
has
willed
it
thus
but
he
has
not
for
that
willed
to
constrain
our
free
will
thereto
in
this
king
one
may
distinguish
two
different
degrees
of
will
the
one
whereby
he
willed
that
these
noblemen
should
fight
since
he
brought
about
their
meeting
and
the
other
whereby
he
did
not
will
it
since
he
forbade
duels
even
so
theologians
distinguish
in
god
an
absolute
and
independent
will
whereby
he
wills
that
all
things
be
done
just
as
they
are
done
and
another
which
is
relative
and
which
concerns
the
merit
or
demerit
of
men
whereby
he
wills
that
his
laws
be
obeyed
descartes
letter
of
vol
pp
compare
with
that
the
quotation
made
by
arnauld
vol
of
his
on
the
system
of
from
thomas
aquinas
on
the
antecedent
and
consequent
will
of
god
here
is
bayle
reply
to
that
to
the
questions
of
a
ch
great
philosopher
is
much
mistaken
it
seems
to
me
there
would
not
be
in
this
monarch
any
degree
of
will
either
small
or
great
that
these
two
noblemen
should
obey
the
law
and
not
fight
he
would
will
entirely
and
solely
that
they
should
fight
that
would
not
exculpate
them
they
would
only
follow
their
passion
they
would
be
unaware
that
they
conformed
to
the
will
of
their
sovereign
but
he
would
be
in
truth
the
moral
cause
of
their
encounter
and
he
would
not
more
entirely
wish
it
supposing
he
were
to
inspire
them
with
the
desire
or
to
give
them
the
order
for
it
imagine
to
yourself
two
princes
each
of
whom
wishes
his
eldest
son
to
poison
himself
one
employs
constraint
the
other
contents
himself
with
secretly
causing
a
grief
that
he
knows
will
be
sufficient
to
induce
his
son
to
poison
himself
will
you
be
doubtful
whether
the
will
of
the
latter
is
less
complete
than
the
will
of
the
former
descartes
is
therefore
assuming
an
unreal
fact
and
does
not
at
all
solve
the
difficulty
one
must
confess
that
descartes
speaks
somewhat
crudely
of
the
will
of
god
in
regard
to
evil
in
saying
not
only
that
god
knew
that
our
free
will
would
determine
us
toward
some
particular
thing
but
also
he
also
wished
albeit
he
did
not
will
to
constrain
the
will
thereto
he
speaks
no
less
harshly
in
the
eighth
letter
of
the
same
volume
saying
that
not
the
slightest
thought
enters
into
the
mind
of
a
man
which
god
does
not
and
has
not
willed
from
all
eternity
to
enter
there
calvin
never
said
anything
harsher
and
all
that
can
only
be
excused
if
it
is
to
be
understood
of
a
permissive
will
descartes
solution
amounts
to
the
distinction
between
the
will
expressed
in
the
sign
and
the
will
expressive
of
the
good
pleasure
voluntatem
signi
et
which
the
moderns
have
taken
from
the
schoolmen
as
regards
the
terms
but
to
which
they
have
given
a
meaning
not
usual
among
the
ancients
it
is
true
that
god
may
command
something
and
yet
not
will
that
it
be
done
as
when
he
commanded
abraham
to
sacrifice
his
son
he
willed
the
obedience
and
he
did
not
will
the
action
but
when
god
commands
the
virtuous
action
and
forbids
the
sin
he
wills
indeed
that
which
he
ordains
but
it
is
only
by
an
antecedent
will
as
i
have
explained
more
than
once
descartes
comparison
is
therefore
not
satisfactory
but
it
may
be
made
so
one
must
make
some
change
in
the
facts
inventing
some
reason
to
oblige
the
prince
to
cause
or
permit
the
two
enemies
to
meet
they
must
for
instance
be
together
in
the
army
or
in
other
obligatory
functions
a
circumstance
the
prince
himself
can
not
hinder
without
endangering
his
state
for
example
the
absence
of
either
of
them
might
be
responsible
for
the
disappearance
of
innumerable
persons
of
his
party
from
the
army
or
cause
grumbling
among
the
soldiers
and
give
rise
to
some
great
disturbance
in
this
case
therefore
one
may
say
that
the
prince
does
not
will
the
duel
he
knows
of
it
but
he
permits
it
notwithstanding
for
he
prefers
permitting
the
sin
of
others
to
committing
one
himself
thus
this
corrected
comparison
may
serve
provided
that
one
observe
the
difference
between
god
and
the
prince
the
prince
is
forced
into
this
permission
by
his
powerlessness
a
more
powerful
monarch
would
have
no
need
of
all
these
considerations
but
god
who
has
power
to
do
all
that
is
possible
only
permits
sin
because
it
is
absolutely
impossible
to
anyone
at
all
to
do
better
the
prince
action
is
peradventure
not
free
from
sorrow
and
regret
this
regret
is
due
to
his
imperfection
of
which
he
is
sensible
therein
lies
displeasure
god
is
incapable
of
such
a
feeling
and
finds
moreover
no
cause
therefor
he
is
infinitely
conscious
of
his
own
perfection
and
it
may
even
be
said
that
the
imperfection
in
creatures
taken
individually
changes
for
him
into
perfection
in
relation
to
the
whole
and
that
it
is
an
added
glory
for
the
creator
what
more
can
one
wish
when
one
possesses
a
boundless
wisdom
and
when
one
is
as
powerful
as
one
is
wise
when
one
can
do
all
and
when
one
has
the
best
having
once
understood
these
things
we
are
hardened
sufficiently
so
it
seems
to
me
against
the
strongest
and
most
spirited
objections
i
have
not
concealed
them
but
there
are
some
we
shall
merely
touch
upon
because
they
are
too
odious
the
remonstrants
and
bayle
to
the
questions
of
a
vol
iii

end

quote
augustine
saying
esse
misericordiam
velle
aliquem
miserum
esse
ut
eius
in
the
same
sense
is
cited
seneca
i
confess
that
one
would
have
some
reason
to
urge
that
against
those
who
believed
that
god
has
no
other
cause
for
permitting
sin
than
the
design
to
have
something
wherewith
to
exercise
punitive
justice
against
the
majority
of
men
and
his
mercy
towards
a
small
number
of
elect
but
it
must
be
considered
that
god
had
reasons
for
his
permission
of
sin
more
worthy
of
him
and
more
profound
in
relation
to
us
someone
has
dared
to
compare
god
course
of
action
with
that
of
a
caligula
who
has
his
edicts
written
in
so
small
a
hand
and
has
them
placarded
in
so
high
a
place
that
it
is
not
possible
to
read
them
with
that
of
a
mother
who
neglects
her
honour
in
order
to
attain
her
own
selfish
ends
with
that
of
queen
catherine
de
medicis
who
is
said
to
have
abetted
the
of
her
ladies
in
order
to
learn
of
the
intrigues
of
the
great
and
even
with
that
of
tiberius
who
arranged
through
the
extraordinary
services
of
the
executioner
that
the
law
forbidding
the
subjection
of
a
virgin
to
capital
punishment
should
no
longer
apply
to
the
case
of
sejanus
daughter
this
last
comparison
was
proposed
by
peter
bertius
then
an
armenian
but
finally
a
member
of
the
roman
communion
and
a
scandalous
comparison
has
been
made
between
god
and
tiberius
which
is
related
at
length
by
andreas
caroli
in
his
of
the
last
century
as
bayle
observes
bertius
used
it
against
the
gomarists
i
think
that
arguments
of
this
kind
are
only
valid
against
those
who
maintain
that
justice
is
an
arbitrary
thing
in
relation
to
god
or
that
he
has
a
despotic
power
which
can
go
so
far
as
being
able
to
condemn
innocents
or
in
short
that
good
is
not
the
motive
of
his
actions
at
that
same
time
an
ingenious
satire
was
composed
against
the
gomarists
entitled
praedestinatus
de
wherein
there
is
introduced
a
thief
condemned
to
be
hanged
who
attributes
to
god
all
the
evil
he
has
done
who
believes
himself
predestined
to
salvation
notwithstanding
his
wicked
actions
who
imagines
that
this
belief
is
sufficient
for
him
and
who
defeats
by
arguments
a
minister
called
to
prepare
him
for
death
but
this
thief
is
finally
converted
by
an
old
pastor
who
had
been
dismissed
for
his
arminianism
whom
the
gaoler
in
pity
for
the
criminal
and
for
the
weakness
of
the
minister
had
brought
to
him
secretly
replies
were
made
to
this
lampoon
but
replies
to
satires
never
please
as
much
as
the
satires
themselves
bayle

the
questions
of

vol
iii
ch
says
that
this
book
was
printed
in
england
in
the
time
of
cromwell
and
he
appears
not
to
have
been
informed
that
it
was
only
a
translation
of
the
much
older
original
flemish
he
adds
that
george
kendal
wrote
a
confutation
of
it
at
oxford
in
the
year
under
the
title
of
pro
and
that
the
dialogue
is
there
inserted
this
dialogue
presupposes
contrary
to
the
truth
that
the
make
god
the
cause
of
evil
and
teach
a
kind
of
predestination
in
the
mahometan
manner
according
to
which
it
does
not
matter
whether
one
does
good
or
evil
and
the
assumption
that
one
is
predestined
assures
the
fact
they
by
no
means
go
so
far
nevertheless
it
is
true
that
there
are
among
them
some
supralapsarians
and
others
who
find
it
hard
to
declare
themselves
in
clear
terms
upon
the
justice
of
god
and
the
principles
of
piety
and
morals
in
man
for
they
imagine
despotism
in
god
and
demand
that
man
be
convinced
without
reason
of
the
absolute
certainty
of
his
election
a
course
that
is
liable
to
have
dangerous
consequences
but
all
those
who
acknowledge
that
god
produces
the
best
plan
having
chosen
it
from
among
all
possible
ideas
of
the
universe
that
he
there
finds
man
inclined
by
the
original
imperfection
of
creatures
to
misuse
his
free
will
and
to
plunge
into
misery
that
god
prevents
the
sin
and
the
misery
in
so
far
as
the
perfection
of
the
universe
which
is
an
emanation
from
his
may
permit
it
those
i
say
show
forth
more
clearly
that
god
intention
is
the
one
most
right
and
holy
in
the
world
that
the
creature
alone
is
guilty
that
his
original
limitation
or
imperfection
is
the
source
of
his
wickedness
that
his
evil
will
is
the
sole
cause
of
his
misery
that
one
can
not
be
destined
to
salvation
without
also
being
destined
to
the
holiness
of
the
children
of
god
and
that
all
hope
of
election
one
can
have
can
only
be
founded
upon
the
good
will
infused
into
one
heart
by
the
grace
of
god
also
are
brought
up
against
my
explanation
of
the
moral
cause
of
moral
evil
but
they
will
trouble
me
less
since
i
have
dismissed
the
objections
derived
from
moral
reasons
which
were
more
impressive
these
metaphysical
considerations
concern
the
nature
of
the
and
of
the
they
go
against
my
fundamental
assumption
that
god
has
chosen
the
best
of
all
possible
worlds
there
are
philosophers
who
have
maintained
that
there
is
nothing
possible
except
that
which
actually
happens
these
are
those
same
people
who
thought
or
could
have
thought
that
all
is
necessary
unconditionally
some
were
of
this
opinion
because
they
admitted
a
brute
and
blind
necessity
in
the
cause
of
the
existence
of
things
and
it
is
these
i
have
most
reason
for
opposing
but
there
are
others
who
are
mistaken
only
because
they
misuse
terms
they
confuse
moral
necessity
with
metaphysical
necessity
they
imagine
that
since
god
can
not
help
acting
for
the
best
he
is
thus
deprived
of
freedom
and
things
are
endued
with
that
necessity
which
philosophers
and
theologians
endeavour
to
avoid
with
these
writers
my
dispute
is
only
one
of
words
provided
they
admit
in
very
deed
that
god
chooses
and
does
the
best
but
there
are
others
who
go
further
they
think
that
god
could
have
done
better
this
is
an
opinion
which
must
be
rejected
for
although
it
does
not
altogether
deprive
god
of
wisdom
and
goodness
as
do
the
advocates
of
blind
necessity
it
sets
bounds
thereto
thus
derogating
from
supreme
perfection
the
question
of
the
of
things
that
do
not
has
already
been
examined
by
the
ancients
it
appears
that
epicurus
to
preserve
freedom
and
to
avoid
an
absolute
necessity
maintained
after
aristotle
that
contingent
futurities
were
not
susceptible
of
determinate
truth
for
if
it
was
true
yesterday
that
i
should
write
it
could
therefore
not
fail
to
happen
it
was
already
necessary
and
for
the
same
reason
it
was
from
all
eternity
thus
all
that
which
happens
is
necessary
and
it
is
impossible
for
anything
different
to
come
to
pass
but
since
that
is
not
so
it
would
follow
according
to
him
that
contingent
futurities
have
no
determinate
truth
to
uphold
this
opinion
epicurus
went
so
far
as
to
deny
the
first
and
the
greatest
principle
of
the
truths
of
reason
he
denied
that
every
assertion
was
either
true
or
false
here
is
the
way
they
confounded
him
deny
that
it
was
true
yesterday
that
i
should
write
it
was
therefore
false
the
good
man
not
being
able
to
admit
this
conclusion
was
obliged
to
say
that
it
was
neither
true
nor
false
after
that
he
needs
no
refutation
and
chrysippus
might
have
spared
himself
the
trouble
he
took
to
prove
the
great
principle
of
contradictories
following
the
account
by
cicero
in
his
book

bayle

article
let
t
neither
of
these
two
great
philosophers
epicurus
and
chrysippus
understood
that
the
truth
of
this
maxim
every
proposition
is
true
or
false
is
independent
of
what
is
called
it
could
not
therefore
serve
as
proof
of
the
existence
of
the
as
chrysippus
maintained
and
as
epicurus
feared
chrysippus
could
not
have
conceded
without
damaging
his
own
position
that
there
are
propositions
which
are
neither
true
nor
false
but
he
gained
nothing
by
asserting
the
contrary
for
whether
there
be
free
causes
or
not
it
is
equally
true
that
this
proposition
the
grand
mogul
will
go

is
true
or
false

regarded
as
ridiculous

on
me
the
faculty
of
prophesying
if
assuming
the
impossible
there
were
no
god
it
would
yet
be
certain
that
everything
the
greatest
fool
in
the
world
should
predict
would
happen
or
would
not
happen
that
is
what
neither
chrysippus
nor
epicurus
has
taken
into
consideration
cicero

i
nat
with
regard
to
the
evasions
of
the
epicureans
expressed
the
sound
opinion
as
bayle
observes
towards
the
end
of
the
same
page
that
it
would
be
much
less
shameful
to
admit
that
one
can
not
answer
one
opponent
than
to
have
recourse
to
such
answers
yet
we
shall
see
that
bayle
himself
confused
the
certain
with
the
necessary
when
he
maintained
that
the
choice
of
the
best
rendered
things
necessary
let
us
come
now
to
the
possibility
of
things
that
do
not
happen
and
i
will
give
the
very
words
of
bayle
albeit
they
are
somewhat
discursive
this
is
what
he
says
on
the
matter
in
his
article
let
s
celebrated
dispute
on
things
possible
and
things
impossible
owed
its
origin
to
the
doctrine
of
the
stoics
concerning
fate
the
question
was
to
know
whether
among
the
things
which
have
never
been
and
never
will
be
there
are
some
possible
or
whether
all
that
is
not
all
that
has
never
been
all
that
will
never
be
was
impossible
a
famous
dialectician
of
the
megaric
sect
named
diodorus
gave
a
negative
answer
to
the
first
of
these
two
questions
and
an
affirmative
to
the
second
but
chrysippus
vehemently
opposed
him

cicero
makes
it
clear
enough
that
chrysippus
often
found
himself
in
difficulties
in
this
dispute
and
that
is
no
matter
for
astonishment
for
the
course
he
had
chosen
was
not
bound
up
with
his
dogma
of
fate
and
if
he
had
known
how
or
had
dared
to
reason
consistently
he
would
readily
have
adopted
the
whole
hypothesis
of
diodorus
we
have
seen
already
that
the
freedom
he
assigned
to
the
soul
and
his
comparison
of
the
cylinder
did
not
preclude
the
possibility
that
in
reality
all
the
acts
of
the
human
will
were
unavoidable
consequences
of
fate
hence
it
follows
that
everything
which
does
not
happen
is
impossible
and
that
there
is
nothing
possible
but
that
which
actually
comes
to
pass
plutarch
stoicor
pp
discomfits
him
completely
on
that
point
as
well
as
on
the
dispute
with
diodorus
and
maintains
that
his
opinion
on
possibility
is
altogether
contrary
to
the
doctrine
of
observe
that
the
most
eminent
stoics
had
written
on
this
matter
without
following
the
same
path
arrian
in
lib
named
four
of
them
who
are
chrysippus
cleanthes
archidemus
and
antipater
he
evinces
great
scorn
for
this
dispute
and
menage
need
not
have
cited
him
as
a
writer
who
had
spoken
in
commendation
of
the
work
of
chrysippus
greek

for
assuredly
these
words

chrysippus
are
not
in
that
connexion
a
eulogy
that
is
shown
by
the
passages
immediately
before
and
after
it
dionysius
of
halicarnassus
collocat
mentions
two
treatises
by
chrysippus
wherein
under
a
title
that
promised
something
different
much
of
the
logicians
territory
had
been
explored
the
work
was
entitled
greek
peri

and
treated
only
of
propositions
true
and
false
possible
and
impossible
contingent
and
equivocal
matter
that
our
schoolmen
have
pounded
down
and
reduced
to
its
essence
take
note
that
chrysippus
recognized
that
past
things
were
necessarily
true
which
cleanthes
had
not
been
willing
to
admit

we
have
already
seen
that
abélard
is
alleged
to
have
taught
a
doctrine
which
resembles
that
of
diodorus
i
think
that
the
stoics
pledged
themselves
to
give
a
wider
range
to
possible
things
than
to
future
things
for
the
purpose
of
mitigating
the
odious
and
frightful
conclusions
which
were
drawn
from
their
dogma
of
fatality
it
is
sufficiently
evident
that
cicero
when
writing
to
varro
the
words
that
have
just
been
quoted
lib
ep
had
not
enough
comprehension
of
the
effect
of
diodorus
opinion
since
he
found
it
preferable
he
presents
tolerably
well
in
his
book
the
opinions
of
those
writers
but
it
is
a
pity
that
he
has
not
always
added
the
reasons
which
they
employed
plutarch
in
his
treatise
on
the
contradictions
of
the
stoics
and
bayle
are
both
surprised
that
chrysippus
was
not
of
the
same
opinion
as
diodorus
since
he
favours
fatality
but
chrysippus
and
even
his
master
cleanthes
were
on
that
point
more
reasonable
than
is
supposed
that
will
be
seen
as
we
proceed
it
is
open
to
question
whether
the
past
is
more
necessary
than
the
future
cleanthes
held
the
opinion
that
it
is
the
objection
is
raised
that
it
is
necessary
for
the
future
to
happen
as
it
is
necessary
for
the
past
to
have
happened
but
there
is
this
difference
that
it
is
not
possible
to
act
on
the
past
state
that
would
be
a
contradiction
but
it
is
possible
to
produce
some
effect
on
the
future
yet
the
hypothetical
necessity
of
both
is
the
same
the
one
can
not
be
changed
the
other
will
not
be
and
once
that
is
past
it
will
not
be
possible
for
it
to
be
changed
either
the
famous
pierre
abélard
expressed
an
opinion
resembling
that
of
diodorus
in
the
statement
that
god
can
do
only
that
which
he
does
it
was
the
third
of
the
fourteen
propositions
taken
from
his
works
which
were
censured
at
the
council
of
sens
it
had
been
taken
from
the
third
book
of
his
to
where
he
treats
especially
of
the
power
of
god
the
reason
he
gave
for
his
statement
was
that
god
can
do
only
that
which
he
wills
now
god
can
not
will
to
do
anything
other
than
that
which
he
does
because
of
necessity
he
must
will
whatever
is
fitting
hence
it
follows
that
all
that
which
he
does
not
is
not
fitting
that
he
can
not
will
to
do
it
and
consequently
that
he
can
not
do
it
abélard
admits
himself
that
this
opinion
is
peculiar
to
him
that
hardly
anyone
shares
in
it
that
it
seems
contrary
to
the
doctrine
of
the
saints
and
to
reason
and
derogatory
to
the
greatness
of
god
it
appears
that
this
author
was
a
little
too
much
inclined
to
speak
and
to
think
differently
from
others
for
in
reality
this
was
only
a
dispute
about
words
he
was
changing
the
use
of
terms
power
and
will
are
different
faculties
whose
objects
also
are
different
it
is
confusing
them
to
say
that
god
can
do
only
that
which
he
wills
on
the
contrary
among
various
possibles
he
wills
only
that
which
he
finds
the
best
for
all
possibles
are
regarded
as
objects
of
power
but
actual
and
existing
things
are
regarded
as
the
objects
of
his
decretory
will
abélard
himself
acknowledged
it
he
raises
this
objection
for
himself
a
reprobate
can
be
saved
but
he
can
only
be
saved
if
god
saves
him
god
can
therefore
save
him
and
consequently
do
something
that
he
does
not
abélard
answers
that
it
may
indeed
be
said
that
this
man
can
be
saved
in
respect
of
the
possibility
of
human
nature
which
is
capable
of
salvation
but
that
it
may
not
be
said
that
god
can
save
him
in
respect
of
god
himself
because
it
is
impossible
that
god
should
do
that
which
he
must
not
do
but
abélard
admits
that
it
may
very
well
be
said
in
a
sense
speaking
absolutely
and
setting
aside
the
assumption
of
reprobation
that
such
an
one
who
is
reprobate
can
be
saved
and
that
thus
often
that
which
god
does
not
can
be
done
he
could
therefore
have
spoken
like
the
rest
who
mean
nothing
different
when
they
say
that
god
can
save
this
man
and
that
he
can
do
that
which
he
does
not
the
necessity
of
wyclif
which
was
condemned
by
the
council
of
constance
seems
to
arise
simply
from
this
same
misunderstanding
i
think
that
men
of
talent
do
wrong
to
truth
and
to
themselves
when
without
reason
they
bring
into
use
new
and
displeasing
expressions
in
our
own
time
the
celebrated
hobbes
supported
this
same
opinion
that
what
does
not
happen
is
impossible
he
proves
it
by
the
statement
that
all
the
conditions
requisite
for
a
thing
that
shall
not
exist
rei
non
futurae
are
never
found
together
and
that
the
thing
can
not
exist
otherwise
but
who
does
not
see
that
that
only
proves
a
hypothetical
impossibility
it
is
true
that
a
thing
can
not
exist
when
a
requisite
condition
for
it
is
lacking
but
as
we
claim
to
be
able
to
say
that
the
thing
can
exist
although
it
does
not
exist
we
claim
in
the
same
way
to
be
able
to
say
that
the
requisite
conditions
can
exist
although
they
do
not
exist
thus
hobbes
argument
leaves
the
matter
where
it
is
the
opinion
which
was
held
concerning
hobbes
that
he
taught
an
absolute
necessity
of
all
things
brought
upon
him
much
discredit
and
would
have
done
him
harm
even
had
it
been
his
only
error
spinoza
went
further
he
appears
to
have
explicitly
taught
a
blind
necessity
having
denied
to
the
author
of
things
understanding
and
will
and
assuming
that
good
and
perfection
relate
to
us
only
and
not
to
him
it
is
true
that
spinoza
opinion
on
this
subject
is
somewhat
obscure
for
he
grants
god
thought
after
having
divested
him
of
understanding
non
intellectum
concedit
there
are
even
passages
where
he
relents
on
the
question
of
necessity
nevertheless
as
far
as
one
can
understand
him
he
acknowledges
no
goodness
in
god
properly
speaking
and
he
teaches
that
all
things
exist
through
the
necessity
of
the
divine
nature
without
any
act
of
choice
by
god
we
will
not
waste
time
here
in
refuting
an
opinion
so
bad
and
indeed
so
inexplicable
my
own
opinion
is
founded
on
the
nature
of
the
possibles
that
is
of
things
that
imply
no
contradiction
i
do
not
think
that
a
spinozist
will
say
that
all
the
romances
one
can
imagine
exist
actually
now
or
have
existed
or
will
still
exist
in
some
place
in
the
universe
yet
one
can
not
deny
that
romances
such
as
those
of
mademoiselle
de
scudéry
or
as
are
possible
let
us
therefore
bring
up
against
him
these
words
of
bayle
which
please
me
well
on
page
is
he
says
great
embarrassment
for
the
spinozists
to
see
that
according
to
their
hypothesis
it
was
as
impossible
from
all
eternity
that
spinoza
for
instance
should
not
die
at
the
hague
as
it
is
impossible
for
two
and
two
to
make
six
they
are
well
aware
that
it
is
a
necessary
conclusion
from
their
doctrine
and
a
conclusion
which
disheartens
affrights
and
stirs
the
mind
to
revolt
because
of
the
absurdity
it
involves
diametrically
opposed
to
common
sense
they
are
not
well
pleased
that
one
should
know
they
are
subverting
a
maxim
so
universal
and
so
evident
as
this
one
all
that
which
implies
contradiction
is
impossible
and
all
that
which
implies
no
contradiction
is
possible
one
may
say
of
bayle
bene
nemo
melius
although
one
can
not
say
of
him
what
was
said
of
origen
male
nemo
pejus
i
will
only
add
that
what
has
just
been
indicated
as
a
maxim
is
in
fact
the
definition
of
the
and
the
bayle
however
adds
here
towards
the
end
a
remark
which
somewhat
spoils
his
eminently
reasonable
statement
what
contradiction
would
there
be
if
spinoza
had
died
in
leyden
would
nature
then
have
been
less
perfect
less
wise
less
powerful
he
confuses
here
what
is
impossible
because
it
implies
contradiction
with
what
can
not
happen
because
it
is
not
meet
to
be
chosen
it
is
true
that
there
would
have
been
no
contradiction
in
the
supposition
that
spinoza
died
in
leyden
and
not
at
the
hague
there
would
have
been
nothing
so
possible
the
matter
was
therefore
indifferent
in
respect
of
the
power
of
god
but
one
must
not
suppose
that
any
event
however
small
it
be
can
be
regarded
as
indifferent
in
respect
of
his
wisdom
and
his
goodness
jesus
christ
has
said
divinely
well
that
everything
is
numbered
even
to
the
hairs
of
our
head
thus
the
wisdom
of
god
did
not
permit
that
this
event
whereof
bayle
speaks
should
happen
otherwise
than
it
happened
not
as
if
by
itself
it
would
have
been
more
deserving
of
choice
but
on
account
of
its
connexion
with
that
entire
sequence
of
the
universe
which
deserved
to
be
given
preference
to
say
that
what
has
already
happened
was
of
no
interest
to
the
wisdom
of
god
and
thence
to
infer
that
it
is
therefore
not
necessary
is
to
make
a
false
assumption
and
argue
incorrectly
to
a
true
conclusion
it
is
confusing
what
is
necessary
by
moral
necessity
that
is
according
to
the
principle
of
wisdom
and
goodness
with
what
is
so
by
metaphysical
and
brute
necessity
which
occurs
when
the
contrary
implies
contradiction
spinoza
moreover
sought
a
metaphysical
necessity
in
events
he
did
not
think
that
god
was
determined
by
his
goodness
and
by
his
perfection
which
this
author
treated
as
chimeras
in
relation
to
the
universe
but
by
the
necessity
of
his
nature
just
as
the
semicircle
is
bound
to
enclose
only
right
angles
without
either
knowing
or
willing
this
for
euclid
demonstrated
that
all
angles
enclosed
between
two
straight
lines
drawn
from
the
extremities
of
the
diameter
towards
a
point
on
the
circumference
of
the
circle
are
of
necessity
right
angles
and
that
the
contrary
implies
contradiction
there
are
people
who
have
gone
to
the
other
extreme
under
the
pretext
of
freeing
the
divine
nature
from
the
yoke
of
necessity
they
wished
to
regard
it
as
altogether
indifferent
with
an
indifference
of
equipoise
they
did
not
take
into
account
that
just
as
metaphysical
necessity
is
preposterous
in
relation
to
god
actions
so
moral
necessity
is
worthy
of
him
it
is
a
happy
necessity
which
obliges
wisdom
to
do
good
whereas
indifference
with
regard
to
good
and
evil
would
indicate
a
lack
of
goodness
or
of
wisdom
and
besides
the
indifference
which
would
keep
the
will
in
a
perfect
equipoise
would
itself
be
a
chimera
as
has
been
already
shown
it
would
offend
against
the
great
principle
of
the
determinant
reason
those
who
believe
that
god
established
good
and
evil
by
an
arbitrary
decree
are
adopting
that
strange
idea
of
mere
indifference
and
other
absurdities
still
stranger
they
deprive
god
of
the
designation
for
what
cause
could
one
have
to
praise
him
for
what
he
does
if
in
doing
something
quite
different
he
would
have
done
equally
well
and
i
have
very
often
been
surprised
that
divers
supralapsarian
theologians
as
for
instance
samuel
rutherford
a
professor
of
theology
in
scotland
who
wrote
when
the
controversies
with
the
remonstrants
were
at
their
height
could
have
been
deluded
by
so
strange
an
idea
rutherford
in
his
apologeticae
pro
says
positively
that
nothing
is
unjust
or
morally
bad
in
god
eyes
before
he
has
forbidden
it
thus
without
this
prohibition
it
would
be
a
matter
of
indifference
whether
one
murdered
or
saved
a
man
loved
god
or
hated
him
praised
or
blasphemed
him
nothing
is
so
unreasonable
as
that
one
may
teach
that
god
established
good
and
evil
by
a
positive
law
or
one
may
assert
that
there
was
something
good
and
just
before
his
decree
but
that
he
is
not
required
to
conform
to
it
and
that
nothing
prevents
him
from
acting
unjustly
and
from
perhaps
condemning
innocence
but
it
all
comes
to
the
same
thing
offering
almost
equal
dishonour
to
god
for
if
justice
was
established
arbitrarily
and
without
any
cause
if
god
came
upon
it
by
a
kind
of
hazard
as
when
one
draws
lots
his
goodness
and
his
wisdom
are
not
manifested
in
it
and
there
is
nothing
at
all
to
attach
him
to
it
if
it
is
by
a
purely
arbitrary
decree
without
any
reason
that
he
has
established
or
created
what
we
call
justice
and
goodness
then
he
can
annul
them
or
change
their
nature
thus
one
would
have
no
reason
to
assume
that
he
will
observe
them
always
as
it
would
be
possible
to
say
he
will
observe
them
on
the
assumption
that
they
are
founded
on
reasons
the
same
would
hold
good
more
or
less
if
his
justice
were
different
from
ours
if
for
example
it
were
written
in
his
code
that
it
is
just
to
make
the
innocent
eternally
unhappy
according
to
these
principles
also
nothing
would
compel
god
to
keep
his
word
or
would
assure
us
of
its
fulfilment
for
why
should
the
law
of
justice
which
states
that
reasonable
promises
must
be
kept
be
more
inviolable
for
him
than
any
other
laws
all
these
three
dogmas
albeit
a
little
different
from
one
another
namely
that
the
nature
of
justice
is
arbitrary
that
it
is
fixed
but
it
is
not
certain
that
god
will
observe
it
and
finally
that
the
justice
we
know
is
not
that
which
he
observes
destroy
the
confidence
in
god
that
gives
us
tranquillity
and
the
love
of
god
that
makes
our
happiness
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
such
a
god
from
behaving
as
a
tyrant
and
an
enemy
of
honest
folk
and
from
taking
pleasure
in
that
which
we
call
evil
why
should
he
not
then
just
as
well
be
the
evil
principle
of
the
manichaeans
as
the
single
good
principle
of
the
orthodox
at
least
he
would
be
neutral
and
as
it
were
suspended
between
the
two
or
even
sometimes
the
one
and
sometimes
the
other
that
would
be
as
if
someone
were
to
say
that
oromasdes
and
arimanius
reign
in
turns
according
to
which
of
the
two
is
the
stronger
or
the
more
adroit
it
is
like
the
saying
of
a
certain
moghul
woman
she
so
it
seems
having
heard
it
said
that
formerly
under
genghis
khan
and
his
successors
her
nation
had
had
dominion
over
most
of
the
north
and
east
told
the
muscovites
recently
when
isbrand
went
to
china
on
behalf
of
the
czar
through
the
country
of
those
tartars
that
the
god
of
the
moghuls
had
been
driven
from
heaven
but
that
one
day
he
would
take
his
own
place
again
the
true
god
is
always
the
same
natural
religion
itself
demands
that
he
be
essentially
as
good
and
wise
as
he
is
powerful
it
is
scarcely
more
contrary
to
reason
and
piety
to
say
that
god
acts
without
cognition
than
to
maintain
that
he
has
cognition
which
does
not
find
the
eternal
rules
of
goodness
and
of
justice
among
its
objects
or
again
to
say
that
he
has
a
will
such
as
heeds
not
these
rules
some
theologians
who
have
written
of
god
right
over
creatures
appear
to
have
conceded
to
him
an
unrestricted
right
an
arbitrary
and
despotic
power
they
thought
that
would
be
placing
divinity
on
the
most
exalted
level
that
may
be
imagined
for
it
and
that
it
would
abase
the
creature
before
the
creator
to
such
an
extent
that
the
creator
is
bound
by
no
laws
of
any
kind
with
respect
to
the
creature
there
are
passages
from
twiss
rutherford
and
some
other
supralapsarians
which
imply
that
god
can
not
sin
whatever
he
may
do
because
he
is
subject
to
no
law
bayle
himself
considers
that
this
doctrine
is
monstrous
and
contrary
to
the
holiness
of
god
but
i
suppose
that
the
intention
of
some
of
these
writers
was
less
bad
than
it
seems
to
be
apparently
they
meant
by
the
term
right
greek
anypeuthynian
a
state
wherein
one
is
responsible
to
none
for
one
actions
but
they
will
not
have
denied
that
god
owes
to
himself
what
goodness
and
justice
demand
of
him
on
that
matter
one
may
see
amyraut
for
it
is
true
that
calvin
appears
orthodox
on
this
subject
and
that
he
is
by
no
means
one
of
the
extreme
supralapsarians
thus
when
bayle
says
somewhere
that
paul
extricates
himself
from
predestination
only
through
the
consideration
of
god
absolute
right
and
the
incomprehensibility
of
his
ways
it
is
implied
that
if
one
understood
them
one
would
find
them
consistent
with
justice
god
not
being
able
to
use
his
power
otherwise
paul
himself
says
that
it
is
a
but
a
depth
of
wisdom
and
is
included
in
goodness
of
the
i
find
that
bayle
speaks
very
well
elsewhere
on
the
application
of
our
notions
of
goodness
to
the
actions
of
god
to
the
questions
of
a
ch
must
not
assert
here
he
says
the
goodness
of
the
infinite
being
is
not
subject
to
the
same
rules
as
the
goodness
of
the
creature
for
if
there
is
in
god
an
attribute
that
can
be
called
goodness
the
marks
of
goodness
in
general
must
apply
to
him
now
when
we
reduce
goodness
to
the
most
general
abstraction
we
find
therein
the
will
to
do
good
divide
and
subdivide
into
as
many
kinds
as
you
shall
please
this
general
goodness
into
infinite
goodness
finite
goodness
kingly
goodness
goodness
of
a
father
goodness
of
a
husband
goodness
of
a
master
you
will
find
in
each
as
an
inseparable
attribute
the
will
to
do
good
i
find
also
that
bayle
combats
admirably
the
opinion
of
those
who
assert
that
goodness
and
justice
depend
solely
upon
the
arbitrary
choice
of
god
who
suppose
moreover
that
if
god
had
been
determined
by
the
goodness
of
things
themselves
to
act
he
would
be
entirely
subjected
to
necessity
in
his
actions
a
state
incompatible
with
freedom
that
is
confusing
metaphysical
necessity
with
moral
necessity
here
is
what
bayle
says
in
objection
to
this
error
ch
consequence
of
this
doctrine
will
be
that
before
god
resolved
upon
creating
the
world
he
saw
nothing
better
in
virtue
than
in
vice
and
that
his
ideas
did
not
show
him
that
virtue
was
more
worthy
of
his
love
than
vice
that
leaves
no
distinction
between
natural
right
and
positive
right
there
will
no
longer
be
anything
unalterable
or
inevitable
in
morals
it
will
have
been
just
as
possible
for
god
to
command
people
to
be
vicious
as
to
command
them
to
be
virtuous
and
one
will
have
no
certainty
that
the
moral
laws
will
not
one
day
be
abrogated
as
the
ceremonial
laws
of
the
jews
were
this
in
a
word
leads
us
straight
to
the
belief
that
god
was
the
free
author
not
only
of
goodness
and
of
virtue
but
also
of
truth
and
of
the
essence
of
things
that
is
what
certain
of
the
cartesians
assert
and
i
confess
that
their
opinion
see
the
continuation
of
thoughts
on
the
might
be
of
some
avail
in
certain
circumstances
yet
it
is
open
to
dispute
for
so
many
reasons
and
subject
to
consequences
so
troublesome
see
chapter
of
the
same
continuation
that
there
are
scarcely
any
extremes
it
were
not
better
to
suffer
rather
than
plunge
into
that
one
it
opens
the
door
to
the
most
exaggerated
pyrrhonism
for
it
leads
to
the
assertion
that
this
proposition
three
and
three
make
six
is
only
true
where
and
during
the
time
when
it
pleases
god
that
it
is
perhaps
false
in
some
parts
of
the
universe
and
that
perhaps
it
will
be
so
among
men
in
the
coming
year
all
that
depends
on
the
free
will
of
god
could
have
been
limited
to
certain
places
and
certain
times
like
the
judaic
ceremonies
this
conclusion
will
be
extended
to
all
the
laws
of
the
decalogue
if
the
actions
they
command
are
in
their
nature
divested
of
all
goodness
to
the
same
degree
as
the
actions
they
forbid
to
say
that
god
having
resolved
to
create
man
just
as
he
is
could
not
but
have
required
of
him
piety
sobriety
justice
and
chastity
because
it
is
impossible
that
the
disorders
capable
of
overthrowing
or
disturbing
his
work
can
please
him
that
is
to
revert
in
effect
to
the
common
opinion
virtues
are
virtues
only
because
they
serve
perfection
or
prevent
the
imperfection
of
those
who
are
virtuous
or
even
of
those
who
have
to
do
with
them
and
they
have
that
power
by
their
nature
and
by
the
nature
of
rational
creatures
before
god
decrees
to
create
them
to
hold
a
different
opinion
would
be
as
if
someone
were
to
say
that
the
rules
of
proportion
and
harmony
are
arbitrary
with
regard
to
musicians
because
they
occur
in
music
only
when
one
has
resolved
to
sing
or
to
play
some
instrument
but
that
is
exactly
what
is
meant
by
being
essential
to
good
music
for
those
rules
belong
to
it
already
in
the
ideal
state
even
when
none
yet
thinks
of
singing
since
it
is
known
that
they
must
of
necessity
belong
to
it
as
soon
as
one
shall
sing
in
the
same
way
virtues
belong
to
the
ideal
state
of
the
rational
creature
before
god
decrees
to
create
it
and
it
is
for
that
very
reason
we
maintain
that
virtues
are
good
by
their
nature
bayle
has
inserted
a
special
chapter
in
his
continuation
of
thoughts
on
the
it
is
chapter
where
he
shows
the
christian
doctors
teach
that
there
are
things
which
are
just
antecedently
to
god
decrees
some
theologians
of
the
augsburg
confession
censured
some
of
the
reformed
who
appeared
to
be
of
a
different
opinion
and
this
error
was
regarded
as
if
it
were
a
consequence
of
the
absolute
decree
which
doctrine
seems
to
exempt
the
will
of
god
from
any
kind
of
reason
stat
pro
ratione
but
as
i
have
observed
already
on
various
occasions
calvin
himself
acknowledged
that
the
decrees
of
god
are
in
conformity
with
justice
and
wisdom
although
the
reasons
that
might

thus
according

the
rules

goodness
and
of

are

to

quotes
a
passage
from
the
celebrated
turretin
which
draws
a
distinction
between
natural
divine
laws
and
positive

laws
moral
laws
are
of
the
first
kind
and
ceremonial
of

samuel
desmarests
a
celebrated
theologian
formerly
at
groningen
and
herr
strinesius
who
is
still
at
frankfort
on
the
oder
advocated
this
same
distinction
and
i
think
that
it
is
the
opinion
most
widely
accepted
even
among
the
reformed
thomas
aquinas
and
all
the
thomists
were
of
the
same
opinion
with
the
bulk
of
the
schoolmen
and
the
theologians
of
the
roman
church
the
casuists
also
held
to
that
idea
i
count
grotius
among
the
most
eminent
of
them
and
he
was
followed
in
this
point
by
his
commentators
herr
pufendorf
appeared
to
be
of
a
different
opinion
which
he
insisted
on
maintaining
in
the
face
of
censure
from
some
theologians
but
he
need
not
be
taken
into
account
not
having
advanced
far
enough
in
subjects
of
this
kind
he
makes
a
vigorous
protest
against
the
absolute
decree
in
his
and
yet
he
approves
what
is
worst
in
the
opinions
of
the
champions
of
this
decree
and
without
which
this
decree
as
others
of
the
reformed
explain
becomes
endurable
aristotle
was
very
orthodox
on
this
matter
of
justice
and
the
schoolmen
followed
him
they
distinguish
just
as
cicero
and
the
jurists
do
between
perpetual
right
which
is
binding
on
all
and
everywhere
and
positive
right
which
is
only
for
certain
times
and
certain
peoples
i
once
read
with
enjoyment
the
of
plato
who
makes
socrates
uphold
the
truth
on
that
point
and
bayle
has
called
attention
to
the
same
passage
bayle
himself
upholds
this
truth
with
considerable
force
in
a
certain
passage
which
it
will
be
well
to
quote
here
in
its
entirety
long
as
it
is
vol
ii
of
the
continuation
of
thoughts
on
the
ch
to
the
teaching
of
countless
writers
of
importance
he
says
is
in
nature
and
in
the
essence
of
certain
things
a
moral
good
or
evil
that
precedes
the
divine
decree
they
prove
this
doctrine
principally
through
the
frightful
consequences
that
attend
the
opposite
dogma
thus
from
the
proposition
that
to
do
wrong
to
no
man
would
be
a
good
action
not
in
itself
but
by
an
arbitrary
dispensation
of
god
will
it
would
follow
that
god
could
have
given
to
man
a
law
directly
opposed
at
all
points
to
the
commandments
of
the
decalogue
that
is
horrifying
but
here
is
a
more
direct
proof
one
derived
from
metaphysics
one
thing
is
certain
that
the
existence
of
god
is
not
an
effect
of
his
will
he
exists
not
because
he
wills
his
existence
but
through
the
necessity
of
his
infinite
nature
his
power
and
his
knowledge
exist
through
the
same
necessity
he
is
he
knows
all
things
not
because
he
wills
it
thus
but
because
these
are
attributes
necessarily
identified
with
him
the
dominion
of
his
will
relates
only
to
the
exercise
of
his
power
he
gives
effect
outside
himself
only
to
that
which
he
wills
and
he
leaves
all
the
rest
in
the
state
of
mere
possibility
thence
it
comes
that
this
dominion
extends
only
over
the
existence
of
creatures
and
not
over
their
essential
being
god
was
able
to
create
matter
a
man
a
circle
or
leave
them
in
nothingness
but
he
was
not
able
to
produce
them
without
giving
them
their
essential
properties
he
had
of
necessity
to
make
man
a
rational
animal
and
to
give
the
round
shape
to
a
circle
since
according
to
his
eternal
ideas
independent
of
the
free
decrees
of
his
will
the
essence
of
man
lay
in
the
properties
of
being
animal
and
rational
and
since
the
essence
of
the
circle
lay
in
having
a
circumference
equally
distant
from
the
centre
as
to
all
its
parts
this
is
what
has
caused
the
christian
philosophers
to
acknowledge
that
the
essences
of
things
are
eternal
and
that
there
are
propositions
of
eternal
truth
consequently
that
the
essences
of
things
and
the
truth
of
the
first
principles
are
immutable
that
is
to
be
understood
not
only
of
theoretical
but
also
of
practical
first
principles
and
of
all
the
propositions
that
contain
the
true
definition
of
creatures
these
essences
and
these
truths
emanate
from
the
same
necessity
of
nature
as
the
knowledge
of
god
since
therefore
it
is
by
the
nature
of
things
that
god
exists
that
he
is
and
that
he
has
perfect
knowledge
of
all
things
it
is
also
by
the
nature
of
things
that
matter
the
triangle
man
and
certain
actions
of
man
have
such
and
such
properties
essentially
god
saw
from
all
eternity
and
in
all
necessity
the
essential
relations
of
numbers
and
the
identity
of
the
subject
and
predicate
in
the
propositions
that
contain
the
essence
of
each
thing
he
saw
likewise
that
the
term
just
is
included
in
these
propositions
to
esteem
what
is
estimable
be
grateful
to
one
benefactor
fulfil
the
conditions
of
a
contract
and
so
on
with
many
others
relating
to
morals
one
is
therefore
justified
in
saying
that
the
precepts
of
natural
law
assume
the
reasonableness
and
justice
of
that
which
is
enjoined
and
that
it
would
be
man
duty
to
practise
what
they
contain
even
though
god
should
have
been
so
indulgent
as
to
ordain
nothing
in
that
respect
pray
observe
that
in
going
back
with
our
visionary
thoughts
to
that
ideal
moment
when
god
has
yet
decreed
nothing
we
find
in
the
ideas
of
god
the
principles
of
morals
under
terms
that
imply
an
obligation
we
understand
these
maxims
as
certain
and
derived
from
the
eternal
and
immutable
order
it
beseems
the
rational
creature
to
conform
to
reason
a
rational
creature
conforming
to
reason
is
to
be
commended
but
not
conforming
thereto
is
blameworthy
you
would
not
dare
to
deny
that
these
truths
impose
upon
man
a
duty
in
relation
to
all
acts
which
are
in
conformity
with
strict
reason
such
as
these
one
must
esteem
all
that
is
estimable
render
good
for
good
do
wrong
to
no
man
honour
one
father
render
to
every
man
that
which
is
his
due
etc
now
since
by
the
very
nature
of
things
and
before
the
divine
laws
the
truths
of
morality
impose
upon
man
certain
duties
thomas
aquinas
and
grotius
were
justified
in
saying
that
if
there
were
no
god
we
should
nevertheless
be
obliged
to
conform
to
natural
law
others
have
said
that
even
supposing
all
rational
beings
in
existence
were
to
perish
true
propositions
would
remain
true
cajetan
maintained
that
if
he
remained
alone
in
the
universe
all
other
things
without
any
exception
having
been
destroyed
the
knowledge
that
he
had
of
the
nature
of
a
rose
would
nevertheless
subsist
the
late
jacob
thomasius
a
celebrated
professor
at
leipzig
made
the
apt
observation
in
his
elucidations
of
the
philosophic
rules
of
daniel
stahl
a
jena
professor
that
it
is
not
advisable
to
go
altogether
beyond
god
and
that
one
must
not
say
with
some
scotists
that
the
eternal
verities
would
exist
even
though
there
were
no
understanding
not
even
that
of
god
for
it
is
in
my
judgement
the
divine
understanding
which
gives
reality
to
the
eternal
verities
albeit
god
will
have
no
part
therein
all
reality
must
be
founded
on
something
existent
it
is
true
that
an
atheist
may
be
a
geometrician
but
if
there
were
no
god
geometry
would
have
no
object
and
without
god
not
only
would
there
be
nothing
existent
but
there
would
be
nothing
possible
that
however
does
not
hinder
those
who
do
not
see
the
connexion
of
all
things
one
with
another
and
with
god
from
being
able
to
understand
certain
sciences
without
knowing
their
first
source
which
is
in
god
aristotle
although
he
also
scarcely
knew
that
source
nevertheless
said
something
of
the
same
kind
which
was
very
apposite
he
acknowledged
that
the
principles
of
individual
forms
of
knowledge
depend
on
a
superior
knowledge
which
gives
the
reason
for
them
and
this
superior
knowledge
must
have
being
and
consequently
god
the
source
of
being
for
its
object
herr
dreier
of
königsberg
has
aptly
observed
that
the
true
metaphysics
which
aristotle
sought
and
which
he
called
greek
tên
zêtoumenên
his
was
theology
yet
the
same
bayle
who
says
so
much
that
is
admirable
in
order
to
prove
that
the
rules
of
goodness
and
justice
and
the
eternal
verities
in
general
exist
by
their
nature
and
not
by
an
arbitrary
choice
of
god
has
spoken
very
hesitatingly
about
them
in
another
passage
continuation
of
thoughts
on
the
vol
ii
ch
towards
the
end
after
having
given
an
account
of
the
opinion
of
descartes
and
a
section
of
his
followers
who
maintain
that
god
is
the
free
cause
of
truths
and
of
essences
he
adds
have
done
all
that
i
could
to
gain
true
understanding
of
this
dogma
and
to
find
the
solution
of
the
difficulties
surrounding
it
i
confess
to
you
quite
simply
that
i
still
can
not
properly
fathom
it
that
does
not
discourage
me
i
suppose
as
other
philosophers
in
other
cases
have
supposed
that
time
will
unfold
the
meaning
of
this
noble
paradox
i
wish
that
father
malebranche
had
thought
fit
to
defend
it
but
he
took
other
measures
is
it
possible
that
the
enjoyment
of
doubt
can
have
such
influence
upon
a
gifted
man
as
to
make
him
wish
and
hope
for
the
power
to
believe
that
two
contradictories
never
exist
together
for
the
sole
reason
that
god
forbade
them
to
and
moreover
that
god
could
have
issued
them
an
order
to
ensure
that
they
always
walked
together
there
is
indeed
a
noble
paradox
father
malebranche
showed
great
wisdom
in
taking
other
measures
i
can
not
even
imagine
that
descartes
can
have
been
quite
seriously
of
this
opinion
although
he
had
adherents
who
found
this
easy
to
believe
and
would
in
all
simplicity
follow
him
where
he
only
made
pretence
to
go
it
was
apparently
one
of
his
tricks
one
of
his
philosophic
feints
he
prepared
for
himself
some
loophole
as
when
for
instance
he
discovered
a
trick
for
denying
the
movement
of
the
earth
while
he
was
a
copernican
in
the
strictest
sense
i
suspect
that
he
had
in
mind
here
another
extraordinary
manner
of
speaking
of
his
own
invention
which
was
to
say
that
affirmations
and
negations
and
acts
of
inner
judgement
in
general
are
operations
of
the
will
through
this
artifice
the
eternal
verities
which
until
the
time
of
descartes
had
been
named
an
object
of
the
divine
understanding
suddenly
became
an
object
of
god
will
now
the
acts
of
his
will
are
free
therefore
god
is
the
free
cause
of
the
verities
that
is
the
outcome
of
the
matter
a
slight
change
in
the
meaning
of
terms
has
caused
all
this
commotion
but
if
the
affirmations
of
necessary
truths
were
actions
of
the
will
of
the
most
perfect
mind
these
actions
would
be
anything
but
free
for
there
is
nothing
to
choose
it
seems
that
descartes
did
not
declare
himself
sufficiently
on
the
nature
of
freedom
and
that
his
conception
of
it
was
somewhat
unusual
for
he
extended
it
so
far
that
he
even
held
the
affirmations
of
necessary
truths
to
be
free
in
god
that
was
preserving
only
the
name
of
freedom
bayle
who
with
others
conceives
this
to
be
a
freedom
of
indifference
that
god
had
had
to
establish
for
instance
the
truths
of
numbers
and
to
ordain
that
three
times
three
made
nine
whereas
he
could
have
commanded
them
to
make
ten
imagines
in
this
strange
opinion
supposing
it
were
possible
to
defend
it
some
kind
of
advantage
gained
against
the
stratonists
strato
was
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
school
of
aristotle
and
the
successor
of
theophrastus
he
maintained
according
to
cicero
account
that
this
world
had
been
formed
such
as
it
is
by
nature
or
by
a
necessary
cause
devoid
of
cognition
i
admit
that
that
might
be
so
if
god
had
so
preformed
matter
as
to
cause
such
an
effect
by
the
laws
of
motion
alone
but
without
god
there
would
not
even
have
been
any
reason
for
existence
and
still
less
for
any
particular
existence
of
things
thus
strato
system
is
not
to
be
feared
nevertheless
bayle
is
in
difficulties
over
this
he
will
not
admit
plastic
natures
devoid
of
cognition
which
cudworth
and
others
had
introduced
for
fear
that
the
modern
stratonists
that
is
the
spinozists
take
advantage
of
it
this
has
involved
him
in
disputes
with
le
clerc
under
the
influence
of
this
error
that
a
cause
can
produce
nothing
where
contrivance
appears
he
is
far
from
conceding
to
me
that
which
produces
naturally
the
organs
of
animals
and
system
of
a
harmony
by
in
bodies
to
make
them
respond
in
accordance
with
their
own
laws
to
the
thoughts
and
the
wills
of
souls
but
it
ought
to
have
been
taken
into
account
that
this
cause
which
produces
such
beautiful
things
in
the
grains
and
seeds
of
plants
and
animals
and
effects
the
actions
of
bodies
as
the
will
ordains
them
was
formed
by
the
hand
of
god
and
god
is
infinitely
more
skilful
than
a
watchmaker
who
himself
makes
machines
and
automata
that
are
capable
of
producing
as
wonderful
effects
as
if
they
possessed
intelligence
now
to
come
to
bayle
apprehensions
concerning
the
stratonists
in
case
one
should
admit
truths
that
are
not
dependent
upon
the
will
of
god
he
seems
to
fear
lest
they
may
take
advantage
against
us
of
the
perfect
regularity
of
the
eternal
verities
since
this
regularity
springs
only
from
the
nature
and
necessity
of
things
without
being
directed
by
any
cognition
bayle
fears
that
one
might
with
strato
thence
infer
that
the
world
also
could
have
become
regular
through
a
blind
necessity
but
it
is
easy
to
answer
that
in
the
region
of
the
eternal
verities
are
found
all
the
possibles
and
consequently
the
regular
as
well
as
the
irregular
there
must
be
a
reason
accounting
for
the
preference
for
order
and
regularity
and
this
reason
can
only
be
found
in
understanding
moreover
these
very
truths
can
have
no
existence
without
an
understanding
to
take
cognizance
of
them
for
they
would
not
exist
if
there
were
no
divine
understanding
wherein
they
are
realized
so
to
speak
hence
strato
does
not
attain
his
end
which
is
to
exclude
cognition
from
that
which
enters
into
the
origin
of
things
the
difficulty
that
bayle
has
imagined
in
connexion
with
strato
seems
a
little
too
subtle
and
that
is
termed
ubi
non
est
he
makes
another
difficulty
which
has
just
as
slight
a
foundation
namely
that
god
would
be
subjected
to
a
kind
of
here
are
his
words
they
are
propositions
of
eternal
truth
which
are
such
by
their
nature
and
not
by
god
institution
if
they
are
not
true
by
a
free
decree
of
his
will
but
if
on
the
contrary
he
has
recognized
them
as
true
of
necessity
because
such
was
their
nature
there
is
a
kind
of
to
which
he
is
subjected
there
is
an
absolutely
insurmountable
natural
necessity
thence
comes
also
the
result
that
the
divine
understanding
in
the
infinity
of
its
ideas
has
always
and
at
the
outset
hit
upon
their
perfect
conformity
with
their
objects
without
the
guidance
of
any
cognition
for
it
would
be
a
contradiction
to
say
that
any
exemplary
cause
had
served
as
a
plan
for
the
acts
of
god
understanding
one
would
never
that
way
find
eternal
ideas
or
any
first
intelligence
one
must
say
then
that
a
nature
which
exists
of
necessity
always
finds
its
way
without
any
need
for
it
to
be
shown
how
then
shall
we
overcome
the
obstinacy
of
a
stratonist
but
again
it
is
easy
to
answer
this
which
binds
even
the
divinity
is
nothing
but
god
own
nature
his
own
understanding
which
furnishes
the
rules
for
his
wisdom
and
his
goodness
it
is
a
happy
necessity
without
which
he
would
be
neither
good
nor
wise
is
it
to
be
desired
that
god
should
not
be
bound
to
be
perfect
and
happy
is
our
condition
which
renders
us
liable
to
fail
worth
envying
and
should
we
not
be
well
pleased
to
exchange
it
for
sinlessness
if
that
depended
upon
us
one
must
be
indeed
weary
of
life
to
desire
the
freedom
to
destroy
oneself
and
to
pity
the
divinity
for
not
having
that
freedom
bayle
himself
reasons
thus
elsewhere
against
those
who
laud
to
the
skies
an
extravagant
freedom
which
they
assume
in
the
will
when
they
would
make
the
will
independent
of
reason
moreover
bayle
wonders
the
divine
understanding
in
the
infinity
of
its
ideas
always
and
at
the
outset
hits
upon
their
perfect
conformity
with
their
objects
without
the
guidance
of
any
cognition
this
objection
is
null
and
void
every
distinct
idea
is
through
its
distinctness
in
conformity
with
its
object
and
in
god
there
are
distinct
ideas
only
at
first
moreover
the
object
exists
nowhere
but
when
it
comes
into
existence
it
will
be
formed
according
to
this
idea
besides
bayle
knows
very
well
that
the
divine
understanding
has
no
need
of
time
for
seeing
the
connexion
of
things
all
trains
of
reasoning
are
in
god
in
a
transcendent
form
and
they
preserve
an
order
amongst
them
in
his
understanding
as
well
as
in
ours
but
with
him
it
is
only
an
order
and
a
of
whereas
with
us
there
is
a
of
it
is
therefore
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
he
who
penetrates
all
things
at
one
stroke
should
always
strike
true
at
the
outset
and
it
must
not
be
said
that
he
succeeds
without
the
guidance
of
any
cognition
on
the
contrary
it
is
because
his
knowledge
is
perfect
that
his
voluntary
actions
are
also
perfect
up
to
now
i
have
shown
that
the
will
of
god
is
not
independent
of
the
rules
of
wisdom
although
indeed
it
is
a
matter
for
surprise
that
one
should
have
been
constrained
to
argue
about
it
and
to
do
battle
for
a
truth
so
great
and
so
well
established
but
it
is
hardly
less
surprising
that
there
should
be
people
who
believe
that
god
only
half
observes
these
rules
and
does
not
choose
the
best
although
his
wisdom
causes
him
to
recognize
it
and
in
a
word
that
there
should
be
writers
who
hold
that
god
could
have
done
better
that
is
more
or
less
the
error
of
the
famous
alfonso
king
of
castile
who
was
elected
king
of
the
romans
by
certain
electors
and
originated
the
astronomical
tables
that
bear
his
name
this
prince
is
reported
to
have
said
that
if
god
in
making
the
world
had
consulted
him
he
would
have
given
god
good
advice
apparently
the
ptolemaic
system
which
prevailed
at
that
time
was
displeasing
to
him
he
believed
therefore
that
something
better
planned
could
have
been
made
and
he
was
right
but
if
he
had
known
the
system
of
copernicus
with
the
discoveries
of
kepler
now
extended
by
knowledge
of
the
gravity
of
the
planets
he
would
indeed
have
confessed
that
the
contrivance
of
the
true
system
is
marvellous
we
see
therefore
that
here
the
question
concerned
the
more
or
less
only
alfonso
maintained
that
better
could
have
been
done
and
his
opinion
was
censured
by
everyone
yet
philosophers
and
theologians
dare
to
support
dogmatically
such
a
belief
and
i
have
many
times
wondered
that
gifted
and
pious
persons
should
have
been
capable
of
setting
bounds
to
the
goodness
and
the
perfection
of
god
for
to
assert
that
he
knows
what
is
best
that
he
can
do
it
and
that
he
does
it
not
is
to
avow
that
it
rested
with
his
will
only
to
make
the
world
better
than
it
is
but
that
is
what
one
calls
lacking
goodness
it
is
acting
against
that
axiom
already
quoted
bonum
habet
rationem
if
some
adduce
experience
to
prove
that
god
could
have
done
better
they
set
themselves
up
as
ridiculous
critics
of
his
works
to
such
will
be
given
the
answer
given
to
all
those
who
criticize
god
course
of
action
and
who
from
this
same
assumption
that
is
the
alleged
defects
of
the
world
would
infer
that
there
is
an
evil
god
or
at
least
a
god
neutral
between
good
and
evil
and
if
we
hold
the
same
opinion
as
king
alfonso
we
shall
i
say
receive
this
answer
you
have
known
the
world
only
since
the
day
before
yesterday
you
see
scarce
farther
than
your
nose
and
you
carp
at
the
world
wait
until
you
know
more
of
the
world
and
consider
therein
especially
the
parts
which
present
a
complete
whole
as
do
organic
bodies
and
you
will
find
there
a
contrivance
and
a
beauty
transcending
all
imagination
let
us
thence
draw
conclusions
as
to
the
wisdom
and
the
goodness
of
the
author
of
things
even
in
things
that
we
know
not
we
find
in
the
universe
some
things
which
are
not
pleasing
to
us
but
let
us
be
aware
that
it
is
not
made
for
us
alone
it
is
nevertheless
made
for
us
if
we
are
wise
it
will
serve
us
if
we
use
it
for
our
service
we
shall
be
happy
in
it
if
we
wish
to
be
someone
will
say
that
it
is
impossible
to
produce
the
best
because
there
is
no
perfect
creature
and
that
it
is
always
possible
to
produce
one
which
would
be
more
perfect
i
answer
that
what
can
be
said
of
a
creature
or
of
a
particular
substance
which
can
always
be
surpassed
by
another
is
not
to
be
applied
to
the
universe
which
since
it
must
extend
through
all
future
eternity
is
an
infinity
moreover
there
is
an
infinite
number
of
creatures
in
the
smallest
particle
of
matter
because
of
the
actual
division
of
the
to
infinity
and
infinity
that
is
to
say
the
accumulation
of
an
infinite
number
of
substances
is
properly
speaking
not
a
whole
any
more
than
the
infinite
number
itself
whereof
one
can
not
say
whether
it
is
even
or
uneven
that
is
just
what
serves
to
confute
those
who
make
of
the
world
a
god
or
who
think
of
god
as
the
soul
of
the
world
for
the
world
or
the
universe
can
not
be
regarded
as
an
animal
or
as
a
substance
it
is
therefore
not
a
question
of
a
creature
but
of
the
universe
and
the
adversary
will
be
obliged
to
maintain
that
one
possible
universe
may
be
better
than
the
other
to
infinity
but
there
he
would
be
mistaken
and
it
is
that
which
he
can
not
prove
if
this
opinion
were
true
it
would
follow
that
god
had
not
produced
any
universe
at
all
for
he
is
incapable
of
acting
without
reason
and
that
would
be
even
acting
against
reason
it
is
as
if
one
were
to
suppose
that
god
had
decreed
to
make
a
material
sphere
with
no
reason
for
making
it
of
any
particular
size
this
decree
would
be
useless
it
would
carry
with
it
that
which
would
prevent
its
effect
it
would
be
quite
another
matter
if
god
decreed
to
draw
from
a
given
point
one
straight
line
to
another
given
straight
line
without
any
determination
of
the
angle
either
in
the
decree
or
in
its
circumstances
for
in
this
case
the
determination
would
spring
from
the
nature
of
the
thing
the
line
would
be
perpendicular
and
the
angle
would
be
right
since
that
is
all
that
is
determined
and
distinguishable
it
is
thus
one
must
think
of
the
creation
of
the
best
of
all
possible
universes
all
the
more
since
god
not
only
decrees
to
create
a
universe
but
decrees
also
to
create
the
best
of
all
for
god
decrees
nothing
without
knowledge
and
he
makes
no
separate
decrees
which
would
be
nothing
but
antecedent
acts
of
will
and
these
we
have
sufficiently
explained
distinguishing
them
from
genuine
decrees
diroys
whom
i
knew
in
rome
theologian
to
cardinal
wrote
a
book
entitled
and
assumptions
in
favour
christian
published
in
paris
in
the
year
bayle
to
the
questions
of
a
vol
iii
ch
recounts
this
objection
brought
up
by
diroys
is
one
more
difficulty
he
says
it
is
no
less
important
to
meet
than
those
given
earlier
since
it
causes
more
trouble
to
those
who
judge
goods
and
evils
by
considerations
founded
on
the
purest
and
most
lofty
maxims
this
is
that
god
being
the
supreme
wisdom
and
goodness
it
seems
to
them
that
he
ought
to
do
all
things
as
wise
and
virtuous
persons
would
wish
them
to
be
done
following
the
rules
of
wisdom
and
of
goodness
which
god
has
imprinted
in
them
and
as
they
would
be
obliged
themselves
to
do
these
things
if
they
depended
upon
them
thus
seeing
that
the
affairs
of
the
world
do
not
go
so
well
as
in
their
opinion
they
might
go
and
as
they
would
go
if
they
interfered
themselves
they
conclude
that
god
who
is
infinitely
better
and
wiser
than
they
or
rather
wisdom
and
goodness
itself
does
not
concern
himself
with
these
affairs
diroys
makes
some
apt
remarks
concerning
this
which
i
will
not
repeat
since
i
have
sufficiently
answered
the
objection
in
more
than
one
passage
and
that
has
been
the
chief
end
of
all
my
discourse
but
he
makes
one
assertion
with
which
i
can
not
agree
he
claims
that
the
objection
proves
too
much
one
must
again
quote
his
own
words
with
bayle
it
does
not
behove
the
supreme
wisdom
and
goodness
to
fail
to
do
what
is
best
and
most
perfect
it
follows
that
all
beings
are
eternally
immutably
and
essentially
as
perfect
and
as
good
as
they
can
be
since
nothing
can
change
except
by
passing
either
from
a
state
less
good
to
a
better
or
from
a
better
to
a
less
good
now
that
can
not
happen
if
it
does
not
behove
god
to
fail
to
do
that
which
is
best
and
most
perfect
when
he
can
do
it
it
will
therefore
be
necessary
that
all
beings
be
eternally
and
essentially
filled
with
a
knowledge
and
a
virtue
as
perfect
as
god
can
give
them
now
all
that
which
is
eternally
and
essentially
as
perfect
as
god
can
make
it
proceeds
essentially
from
him
in
a
word
is
eternally
and
essentially
good
as
he
is
and
consequently
it
is
god
as
he
is
that
is
the
bearing
of
this
maxim
that
it
is
repugnant
to
supreme
justice
and
goodness
not
to
make
things
as
good
and
perfect
as
they
can
be
for
it
is
essential
to
essential
wisdom
and
goodness
to
banish
all
that
is
repugnant
to
it
altogether
one
must
therefore
assert
as
a
primary
truth
concerning
the
conduct
of
god
in
relation
to
creatures
that
there
is
nothing
repugnant
to
this
goodness
and
this
wisdom
in
making
things
less
perfect
than
they
could
be
or
in
permitting
the
goods
that
it
has
produced
either
completely
to
cease
to
be
or
to
change
and
deteriorate
for
it
causes
no
offence
to
god
that
there
should
be
other
beings
than
he
that
is
beings
who
can
be
not
what
they
are
and
do
not
what
they
do
or
do
what
they
do
not
bayle
calls
this
answer
paltry
but
i
find
his
involved
bayle
will
have
those
who
are
for
the
two
principles
to
take
their
stand
chiefly
on
the
assumption
of
the
supreme
freedom
of
god
for
if
he
were
compelled
to
produce
all
that
which
he
can
he
would
produce
also
sins
and
sorrows
thus
the
dualists
could
from
the
existence
of
evil
conclude
nothing
contrary
to
the
oneness
of
the
principle
if
this
principle
were
as
much
inclined
to
evil
as
to
good
there
bayle
carries
the
notion
of
freedom
too
far
for
even
though
god
be
supremely
free
it
does
not
follow
that
he
maintains
an
indifference
of
equipoise
and
even
though
he
be
inclined
to
act
it
does
not
follow
that
he
is
compelled
by
this
inclination
to
produce
all
that
which
he
can
he
will
produce
only
that
which
he
wills
for
his
inclination
prompts
him
to
good
i
admit
the
supreme
freedom
of
god
but
i
do
not
confuse
it
with
indifference
of
equipoise
as
if
he
could
act
without
reason
diroys
therefore
imagines
that
the
dualists
in
their
insistence
that
the
single
good
principle
produce
no
evil
ask
too
much
for
by
the
same
reason
according
to
diroys
they
ought
also
to
ask
that
he
should
produce
the
greatest
good
the
less
good
being
a
kind
of
evil
i
hold
that
the
dualists
are
wrong
in
respect
of
the
first
point
and
that
they
would
be
right
in
respect
of
the
second
where
diroys
blames
them
without
cause
or
rather
that
one
can
reconcile
the
evil
or
the
less
good
in
some
parts
with
the
best
in
the
whole
if
the
dualists
demanded
that
god
should
do
the
best
they
would
not
be
demanding
too
much
they
are
mistaken
rather
in
claiming
that
the
best
in
the
whole
should
be
free
from
evil
in
the
parts
and
that
therefore
what
god
has
made
is
not
the
best
but
diroys
maintains
that
if
god
always
produces
the
best
he
will
produce
other
gods
otherwise
each
substance
that
he
produced
would
not
be
the
best
nor
the
most
perfect
but
he
is
mistaken
through
not
taking
into
account
the
order
and
connexion
of
things
if
each
substance
taken
separately
were
perfect
all
would
be
alike
which
is
neither
fitting
nor
possible
if
they
were
gods
it
would
not
have
been
possible
to
produce
them
the
best
system
of
things
will
therefore
not
contain
gods
it
will
always
be
a
system
of
bodies
that
is
things
arranged
according
to
time
and
place
and
of
souls
which
represent
and
are
aware
of
bodies
and
in
accordance
with
which
bodies
are
in
great
measure
directed
so
as
the
design
of
a
building
may
be
the
best
of
all
in
respect
of
its
purpose
of
expense
and
of
circumstances
and
as
an
arrangement
of
some
figured
representations
of
bodies
which
is
given
to
you
may
be
the
best
that
one
can
find
it
is
easy
to
imagine
likewise
that
a
structure
of
the
universe
may
be
the
best
of
all
without
becoming
a
god
the
connexion
and
order
of
things
brings
it
about
that
the
body
of
every
animal
and
of
every
plant
is
composed
of
other
animals
and
of
other
plants
or
of
other
living
and
organic
beings
consequently
there
is
subordination
and
one
body
one
substance
serves
the
other
thus
their
perfection
can
not
be
equal
bayle
thinks
that
diroys
has
confused
two
different
propositions
according
to
the
one
god
must
do
all
things
as
wise
and
virtuous
persons
would
wish
that
they
should
be
done
by
the
rules
of
wisdom
and
of
goodness
that
god
has
imprinted
in
them
and
as
they
would
be
obliged
themselves
to
do
them
if
those
things
depended
upon
them
the
other
is
that
it
is
not
consistent
with
supreme
wisdom
and
goodness
to
fail
to
do
what
is
best
and
most
perfect
diroys
in
bayle
opinion
sets
up
the
first
proposition
as
an
objection
for
himself
and
replies
to
the
second
but
therein
he
is
justified
as
it
seems
to
me
for
these
two
propositions
are
connected
the
second
is
a
result
of
the
first
to
do
less
good
than
one
could
is
to
be
lacking
in
wisdom
or
in
goodness
to
be
the
best
and
to
be
desired
by
those
who
are
most
virtuous
and
wise
comes
to
the
same
thing
and
it
may
be
said
that
if
we
could
understand
the
structure
and
the
economy
of
the
universe
we
should
find
that
it
is
made
and
directed
as
the
wisest
and
most
virtuous
could
wish
it
since
god
can
not
fail
to
do
thus
this
necessity
nevertheless
is
only
of
a
moral
nature
and
i
admit
that
if
god
were
forced
by
a
metaphysical
necessity
to
produce
that
which
he
makes
he
would
produce
all
the
possibles
or
nothing
and
in
this
sense
bayle
conclusion
would
be
fully
correct
but
as
all
the
possibles
are
not
compatible
together
in
one
and
the
same
for
that
very
reason
all
the
possibles
can
not
be
produced
and
it
must
be
said
that
god
is
not
forced
metaphysically
speaking
into
the
creation
of
this
world
one
may
say
that
as
soon
as
god
has
decreed
to
create
something
there
is
a
struggle
between
all
the
possibles
all
of
them
laying
claim
to
existence
and
that
those
which
being
united
produce
most
reality
most
perfection
most
significance
carry
the
day
it
is
true
that
all
this
struggle
can
only
be
ideal
that
is
to
say
it
can
only
be
a
conflict
of
reasons
in
the
most
perfect
understanding
which
can
not
fail
to
act
in
the
most
perfect
way
and
consequently
to
choose
the
best
yet
god
is
bound
by
a
moral
necessity
to
make
things
in
such
a
manner
that
there
can
be
nothing
better
otherwise
not
only
would
others
have
cause
to
criticize
what
he
makes
but
more
than
that
he
would
not
himself
be
satisfied
with
his
work
he
would
blame
himself
for
its
imperfection
and
that
conflicts
with
the
supreme
felicity
of
the
divine
nature
this
perpetual
sense
of
his
own
fault
or
imperfection
would
be
to
him
an
inevitable
source
of
grief
as
bayle
says
on
another
occasion
diroys
argument
contains
a
false
assumption
in
his
statement
that
nothing
can
change
except
by
passing
from
a
state
less
good
to
a
better
or
from
a
better
to
a
less
good
and
that
thus
if
god
makes
the
best
what
he
has
produced
can
not
be
changed
it
would
be
an
eternal
substance
a
god
but
i
do
not
see
why
a
thing
can
not
change
its
kind
in
relation
to
good
or
evil
without
changing
its
degree
in
the
transition
from
enjoyment
of
music
to
enjoyment
of
painting
or
from
the
pleasure
of
the
eyes
to
that
of
the
ears
the
degree
of
enjoyment
may
remain
the
same
the
latter
gaining
no
advantage
over
the
former
save
that
of
novelty
if
the
quadrature
of
the
circle
should
come
to
pass
or
what
is
the
same
thing
the
circulature
of
the
square
that
is
if
the
circle
were
changed
into
a
square
of
the
same
size
or
the
square
into
a
circle
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
on
the
whole
without
having
regard
to
some
special
use
whether
one
would
have
gained
or
lost
thus
the
best
may
be
changed
into
another
which
neither
yields
to
it
nor
surpasses
it
but
there
will
always
be
an
order
among
them
and
that
the
best
order
possible
taking
the
whole
sequence
of
things
the
best
has
no
equal
but
one
part
of
the
sequence
may
be
equalled
by
another
part
of
the
same
sequence
besides
it
might
be
said
that
the
whole
sequence
of
things
to
infinity
may
be
the
best
possible
although
what
exists
all
through
the
universe
in
each
portion
of
time
be
not
the
best
it
might
be
therefore
that
the
universe
became
even
better
and
better
if
the
nature
of
things
were
such
that
it
was
not
permitted
to
attain
to
the
best
all
at
once
but
these
are
problems
of
which
it
is
hard
for
us
to
judge
bayle
says
that
the
question
whether
god
could
have
made
things
more
perfect
than
he
made
them
is
also
very
difficult
and
that
the
reasons
for
and
against
are
very
strong
but
it
is
so
it
seems
to
me
as
if
one
were
to
question
whether
god
actions
are
consistent
with
the
most
perfect
wisdom
and
the
greatest
goodness
it
is
a
very
strange
thing
that
by
changing
the
terms
a
little
one
throws
doubt
upon
what
is
if
properly
understood
as
clear
as
anything
can
be
the
reasons
to
the
contrary
have
no
force
being
founded
only
on
the
semblance
of
defects
and
objection
which
tends
to
prove
that
the
law
of
the
best
would
impose
upon
god
a
true
metaphysical
necessity
is
only
an
illusion
that
springs
from
the
misuse
of
terms
bayle
formerly
held
a
different
opinion
when
he
commended
that
of
father
malebranche
which
was
akin
to
mine
on
this
subject
but
arnauld
having
written
in
opposition
to
father
malebranche
bayle
altered
his
opinion
and
i
suppose
that
his
tendency
towards
doubt
which
increased
in
him
with
the
years
was
conducive
to
that
result
arnauld
was
doubtless
a
great
man
and
his
authority
has
great
weight
he
made
sundry
good
observations
in
his
writings
against
father
malebranche
but
he
was
not
justified
in
contesting
those
of
his
statements
that
were
akin
to
mine
on
the
rule
of
the
best
the
excellent
author
of
search
for
having
passed
from
philosophy
to
theology
published
finally
an
admirable
treatise
on
nature
and
grace
here
he
showed
in
his
way
as
bayle
explained
in
his
thoughts
on
the
ch
that
the
events
which
spring
from
the
enforcement
of
general
laws
are
not
the
object
of
a
particular
will
of
god
it
is
true
that
when
one
wills
a
thing
one
wills
also
in
a
sense
everything
that
is
necessarily
attached
to
it
and
in
consequence
god
can
not
will
general
laws
without
also
willing
in
a
sense
all
the
particular
effects
that
must
of
necessity
be
derived
from
them
but
it
is
always
true
that
these
particular
events
are
not
willed
for
their
own
sake
and
that
is
what
is
meant
by
the
expression
that
they
are
not
willed
by
a
and
direct
there
is
no
doubt
that
when
god
resolved
to
act
outside
himself
he
made
choice
of
a
manner
of
action
which
should
be
worthy
of
the
supremely
perfect
being
that
is
which
should
be
infinitely
simple
and
uniform
but
yet
of
an
infinite
productivity
one
may
even
suppose
that
this
manner
of
action
by
acts
of
appeared
to
him
preferable
although
there
must
thence
result
some
superfluous
events
and
even
bad
if
they
are
taken
separately
that
is
my
own
addition
to
another
manner
more
composed
and
more
regular
such
is
father
opinion
nothing
is
more
appropriate
than
this
assumption
according
to
the
opinion
of
bayle
when
he
wrote
his
thoughts
on
the
to
solve
a
thousand
difficulties
which
are
brought
up
against
divine
providence
ask
god
he
says
he
has
made
things
which
serve
to
render
men
more
wicked
that
would
be
to
ask
why
god
has
carried
out
his
plan
which
can
only
be
of
infinite
beauty
by
the
simplest
and
most
uniform
methods
and
why
by
a
complexity
of
decrees
that
would
unceasingly
cut
across
one
another
he
has
not
prevented
the
wrong
use
of
man
free
will
he
adds
miracles
being
particular
acts
of
will
must
have
an
end
worthy
of
god
on
these
foundations
he
makes
some
good
reflexions
ch
concerning
the
injustice
of
those
who
complain
of
the
prosperity
of
the
wicked
shall
have
no
scruples
he
says
saying
that
all
those
who
are
surprised
at
the
prosperity
of
the
wicked
have
pondered
very
little
upon
the
nature
of
god
and
that
they
have
reduced
the
obligations
of
a
cause
which
directs
all
things
to
the
scope
of
a
providence
altogether
subordinate
and
that
is
what
then
should
god
after
having
made
free
causes
and
necessary
causes
in
a
mixture
infinitely
well
fitted
to
show
forth
the
wonders
of
his
infinite
wisdom
have
established
laws
consistent
with
the
nature
of
free
causes
but
so
lacking
in
firmness
that
the
slightest
trouble
that
came
upon
a
man
would
overthrow
them
entirely
to
the
ruin
of
human
freedom
a
mere
city
governor
will
become
an
object
of
ridicule
if
he
changes
his
regulations
and
orders
as
often
as
someone
is
pleased
to
murmur
against
him
and
shall
god
whose
laws
concern
a
good
so
universal
that
all
of
the
world
that
is
visible
to
us
perchance
enters
into
it
as
no
more
than
a
trifling
accessary
be
bound
to
depart
from
his
laws
because
they
displease
the
one
and
the
other
or
again
because
a
superstitious
person
deeming
wrongly
that
a
monstrosity
presages
something
deadly
proceeds
from
his
error
to
a
criminal
sacrifice
or
because
a
good
soul
who
yet
does
not
value
virtue
highly
enough
to
believe
that
to
have
none
is
punishment
enough
in
itself
is
shocked
that
a
wicked
man
should
become
rich
and
enjoy
vigorous
health
can
one
form
any
falser
notions
of
a
universal
providence
everyone
agrees
that
this
law
of
nature
the
strong
prevails
over
the
weak
has
been
very
wisely
laid
down
and
that
it
would
be
absurd
to
maintain
that
when
a
stone
falls
on
a
fragile
vase
which
is
the
delight
of
its
owner
god
should
depart
from
this
law
in
order
to
spare
that
owner
vexation
should
one
then
not
confess
that
it
is
just
as
absurd
to
maintain
that
god
must
depart
from
the
same
law
to
prevent
a
wicked
man
from
growing
rich
at
the
expense
of
a
good
man
the
more
the
wicked
man
sets
himself
above
the
promptings
of
conscience
and
of
honour
the
more
does
he
exceed
the
good
man
in
strength
so
that
if
he
comes
to
grips
with
the
good
man
he
must
according
to
the
course
of
nature
ruin
him
if
moreover
they
are
both
engaged
in
the
business
of
finance
the
wicked
man
must
according
to
the
same
course
of
nature
grow
richer
than
the
good
man
just
as
a
fierce
fire
consumes
more
wood
than
a
fire
of
straw
those
who
would
wish
sickness
for
a
wicked
man
are
sometimes
as
unfair
as
those
who
would
wish
that
a
stone
falling
on
a
glass
should
not
break
it
for
his
organs
being
arranged
as
they
are
neither
the
food
that
he
takes
nor
the
air
that
he
breathes
can
according
to
natural
laws
be
detrimental
to
his
health
therefore
those
who
complain
about
his
health
complain
of
god
failure
to
violate
the
laws
which
he
has
established
and
in
this
they
are
all
the
more
unfair
because
through
combinations
and
concatenations
which
were
in
the
power
of
god
alone
it
happens
often
enough
that
the
course
of
nature
brings
about
the
punishment
of
sin
it
is
a
thousand
pities
that
bayle
so
soon
quitted
the
way
he
had
so
auspiciously
begun
of
reasoning
on
behalf
of
providence
for
his
work
would
have
been
fruitful
and
in
saying
fine
things
he
would
have
said
good
things
as
well
i
agree
with
father
malebranche
that
god
does
things
in
the
way
most
worthy
of
him
but
i
go
a
little
further
than
he
with
regard
to
and
particular
acts
of
will
as
god
can
do
nothing
without
reasons
even
when
he
acts
miraculously
it
follows
that
he
has
no
will
about
individual
events
but
what
results
from
some
general
truth
or
will
thus
i
would
say
that
god
never
has
a
such
as
this
father
implies
that
is
to
say
particular
primitive
i
think
even
that
miracles
have
nothing
to
distinguish
them
from
other
events
in
this
regard
for
reasons
of
an
order
superior
to
that
of
nature
prompt
god
to
perform
them
thus
i
would
not
say
with
this
father
that
god
departs
from
general
laws
whenever
order
requires
it
he
departs
from
one
law
only
for
another
law
more
applicable
and
what
order
requires
can
not
fail
to
be
in
conformity
with
the
rule
of
order
which
is
one
of
the
general
laws
the
distinguishing
mark
of
miracles
taken
in
the
strictest
sense
is
that
they
can
not
be
accounted
for
by
the
natures
of
created
things
that
is
why
should
god
make
a
general
law
causing
bodies
to
be
attracted
the
one
to
the
other
he
could
only
achieve
its
operation
by
perpetual
miracles
and
likewise
if
god
willed
that
the
organs
of
human
bodies
should
conform
to
the
will
of
the
soul
according
to
the
of
occasional
this
law
also
would
come
into
operation
only
through
perpetual
miracles
thus
one
must
suppose
that
among
the
general
rules
which
are
not
absolutely
necessary
god
chooses
those
which
are
the
most
natural
which
it
is
easiest
to
explain
and
which
also
are
of
greatest
service
for
the
explanation
of
other
things
that
is
doubtless
the
conclusion
most
excellent
and
most
pleasing
and
even
though
the
system
of
harmony
were
not
necessary
otherwise
because
it
banishes
superfluous
miracles
god
would
have
chosen
it
as
being
the
most
harmonious
the
ways
of
god
are
those
most
simple
and
uniform
for
he
chooses
rules
that
least
restrict
one
another
they
are
also
the
most
in
proportion
to
the
of
ways
and
it
is
as
if
one
said
that
a
certain
house
was
the
best
that
could
have
been
constructed
at
a
certain
cost
one
may
indeed
reduce
these
two
conditions
simplicity
and
productivity
to
a
single
advantage
which
is
to
produce
as
much
perfection
as
is
possible
thus
father
malebranche
system
in
this
point
amounts
to
the
same
as
mine
even
if
the
effect
were
assumed
to
be
greater
but
the
process
less
simple
i
think
one
might
say
that
when
all
is
said
and
done
the
effect
itself
would
be
less
great
taking
into
account
not
only
the
final
effect
but
also
the
mediate
effect
for
the
wisest
mind
so
acts
as
far
as
it
is
possible
that
the
are
also
in
a
sense
that
is
they
are
desirable
not
only
on
account
of
what
they
do
but
on
account
of
what
they
are
the
more
intricate
processes
take
up
too
much
ground
too
much
space
too
much
place
too
much
time
that
might
have
been
better
employed
now
since
everything
resolves
itself
into
this
greatest
perfection
we
return
to
my
law
of
the
best
for
perfection
includes
not
only
the
and
the
of
intelligent
creatures
but
also
the
good
which
is
purely
and
concerns
also
creatures
devoid
of
reason
it
follows
that
the
evil
that
is
in
rational
creatures
happens
only
by
concomitance
not
by
antecedent
will
but
by
a
consequent
will
as
being
involved
in
the
best
possible
plan
and
the
metaphysical
good
which
includes
everything
makes
it
necessary
sometimes
to
admit
physical
evil
and
moral
evil
as
i
have
already
explained
more
than
once
it
so
happens
that
the
ancient
stoics
were
not
far
removed
from
this
system
bayle
remarked
upon
this
himself
in
his
in
the
article
on
rem
it
is
of
importance
to
give
his
own
words
in
order
sometimes
to
face
him
with
his
own
objections
and
to
bring
him
back
to
the
fine
sentiments
that
he
had
formerly
pronounced
he
says
his
work
on
providence
examined
amongst
other
questions
this
one
did
the
nature
of
things
or
the
providence
that
made
the
world
and
the
human
kind
make
also
the
diseases
to
which
men
are
subject
he
answers
that
the
chief
design
of
nature
was
not
to
make
them
sickly
that
would
not
be
in
keeping
with
the
cause
of
all
good
but
nature
in
preparing
and
producing
many
great
things
excellently
ordered
and
of
great
usefulness
found
that
some
drawbacks
came
as
a
result
and
thus
these
were
not
in
conformity
with
the
original
design
and
purpose
they
came
about
as
a
sequel
to
the
work
they
existed
only
as
consequences
for
the
formation
of
the
human
body
chrysippus
said
the
finest
idea
as
well
as
the
very
utility
of
the
work
demanded
that
the
head
should
be
composed
of
a
tissue
of
thin
fine
bones
but
because
of
that
it
was
bound
to
have
the
disadvantage
of
not
being
able
to
resist
blows
nature
made
health
and
at
the
same
time
it
was
necessary
by
a
kind
of
concomitance
that
the
source
of
diseases
should
be
opened
up
the
same
thing
applies
with
regard
to
virtue
the
direct
action
of
nature
which
brought
it
forth
produced
by
a
counter
stroke
the
brood
of
vices

not
translated

do
not
think
that
a
pagan
could
have
said
anything
more
reasonable
considering
his
ignorance
of
the
first
man
fall
the
knowledge
of
which
has
only
reached
us
through
revelation
and
which
indeed
is
the
true
cause
of
our
miseries
if
we
had
sundry
like
extracts
from
the
works
of
chrysippus
or
rather
if
we
had
his
works
we
should
have
a
more
favourable
idea
than
we
have
of
the
beauty
of
his
genius
let
us
now
see
the
reverse
of
the
medal
in
the
altered
bayle
after
having
quoted
in
his
to
the
questions
of
a
vol
iii
ch
these
words
of
jacquelot
which
are
much
to
my
liking
change
the
order
of
the
universe
is
something
of
infinitely
greater
consequence
than
the
prosperity
of
a
good
man
he
adds
thought
has
something
dazzling
about
it
father
malebranche
has
placed
it
in
the
best
possible
light
and
he
has
persuaded
some
of
his
readers
that
a
system
which
is
simple
and
very
productive
is
more
consistent
with
god
wisdom
than
a
system
more
composite
and
less
productive
in
proportion
but
more
capable
of
averting
irregularities
bayle
was
one
of
those
who
believed
that
father
malebranche
in
that
way
gave
a
wonderful
solution
it
is
bayle
himself
speaking
it
is
almost
impossible
to
be
satisfied
with
it
after
having
read
arnauld
books
against
this
system
and
after
having
contemplated
the
vast
and
boundless
idea
of
the
supremely
perfect
being
this
idea
shows
us
that
nothing
is
easier
for
god
than
to
follow
a
plan
which
is
simple
productive
regular
and
opportune
for
all
creatures
simultaneously
while
i
was
in
france
i
showed
to
arnauld
a
dialogue
i
had
composed
in
latin
on
the
cause
of
evil
and
the
justice
of
god
it
was
not
only
before
his
disputes
with
father
malebranche
but
even
before
the
book
on
search
for
appeared
that
principle
which
i
uphold
here
namely
that
sin
had
been
permitted
because
it
had
been
involved
in
the
best
plan
for
the
universe
was
already
applied
there
and
arnauld
did
not
seem
to
be
startled
by
it
but
the
slight
contentions
which
he
has
since
had
with
father
malebranche
have
given
him
cause
to
examine
this
subject
with
closer
attention
and
to
be
more
severe
in
his
judgement
thereof
yet
i
am
not
altogether
pleased
with
bayle
manner
of
expression
here
on
this
subject
and
i
am
not
of
the
opinion
a
more
composite
and
less
productive
plan
might
be
more
capable
of
averting
irregularities
rules
are
the
expression
of
general
will
the
more
one
observes
rules
the
more
regularity
there
is
simplicity
and
productivity
are
the
aim
of
rules
i
shall
be
met
with
the
objection
that
a
uniform
system
will
be
free
from
irregularities
i
answer
that
it
would
be
an
irregularity
to
be
too
uniform
that
would
offend
against
the
rules
of
harmony
citharoedus
ridetur
chorda
qui
semper
oberrat
i
believe
therefore
that
god
can
follow
a
simple
productive
regular
plan
but
i
do
not
believe
that
the
best
and
the
most
regular
is
always
opportune
for
all
creatures
simultaneously
and
i
judge
for
the
plan
chosen
by
god
is
not
so
i
have
however
also
shown
this
in
examples
taken
from
mathematics
and
i
will
presently
give
another
here
an
origenist
who
maintains
that
all
rational
creatures
become
happy
in
the
end
will
be
still
easier
to
satisfy
he
will
say
in
imitation
of
paul
saying
about
the
sufferings
of
this
life
that
those
which
are
finite
are
not
worthy
to
be
compared
with
eternal
bliss
what
is
deceptive
in
this
subject
as
i
have
already
observed
is
that
one
feels
an
inclination
to
believe
that
what
is
the
best
in
the
whole
is
also
the
best
possible
in
each
part
one
reasons
thus
in
geometry
when
it
is
a
question
maximis
et
if
the
road
from
a
to
b
that
one
proposes
to
take
is
the
shortest
possible
and
if
this
road
passes
by
c
then
the
road
from
a
to
c
part
of
the
first
must
also
be
the
shortest
possible
but
the
inference
from
to
is
not
always
right
any
more
than
that
which
is
drawn
from
equals
to
similars
for
are
those
whose
quantity
is
the
same
and
are
those
not
differing
according
to
qualities
the
late
herr
sturm
a
famous
mathematician
in
altorf
while
in
holland
in
his
youth
published
there
a
small
book
under
the
title
of
here
he
endeavoured
to
give
exact
and
general
rules
in
subjects
not
mathematical
being
encouraged
in
the
task
by
the
late
herr
erhard
weigel
who
had
been
his
tutor
in
this
book
he
transfers
to
similars
what
euclid
had
said
of
equals
and
he
formulates
this
axiom
similibus
addas
similia
tota
sunt
but
so
many
limitations
were
necessary
to
justify
this
new
rule
that
it
would
have
been
better
in
my
opinion
to
enounce
it
at
the
outset
with
a
reservation
by
saying
similibus
similia
addas
similiter
tota
sunt
moreover
geometricians
often
require
tantum
similia
sed
et
similiter
this
difference
between
quantity
and
quality
appears
also
in
our
case
the
part
of
the
shortest
way
between
two
extreme
points
is
also
the
shortest
way
between
the
extreme
points
of
this
part
but
the
part
of
the
best
whole
is
not
of
necessity
the
best
that
one
could
have
made
of
this
part
for
the
part
of
a
beautiful
thing
is
not
always
beautiful
since
it
can
be
extracted
from
the
whole
or
marked
out
within
the
whole
in
an
irregular
manner
if
goodness
and
beauty
always
lay
in
something
absolute
and
uniform
such
as
extension
matter
gold
water
and
other
bodies
assumed
to
be
homogeneous
or
similar
one
must
say
that
the
part
of
the
good
and
the
beautiful
would
be
beautiful
and
good
like
the
whole
since
it
would
always
have
resemblance
to
the
whole
but
this
is
not
the
case
in
things
that
have
mutual
relations
an
example
taken
from
geometry
will
be
appropriate
to
explain
my
idea
there
is
a
kind
of
geometry
which
herr
jung
of
hamburg
one
of
the
most
admirable
men
of
his
time
called
it
makes
use
of
conclusive
experiments
and
proves
various
propositions
of
euclid
but
especially
those
which
concern
the
equality
of
two
figures
by
cutting
the
one
in
pieces
and
putting
the
pieces
together
again
to
make
the
other
in
this
manner
by
cutting
carefully
in
parts
the
squares
on
the
two
sides
of
the
triangle
and
arranging
these
parts
carefully
one
makes
from
them
the
square
on
the
hypotenuse
that
is
demonstrating
empirically
the
proposition
of
the
first
book
of
euclid
now
supposing
that
some
of
these
pieces
taken
from
the
two
smaller
squares
are
lost
something
will
be
lacking
in
the
large
square
that
is
to
be
formed
from
them
and
this
defective
combination
far
from
pleasing
will
be
disagreeably
ugly
if
then
the
pieces
that
remained
composing
the
faulty
combination
were
taken
separately
without
any
regard
to
the
large
square
to
whose
formation
they
ought
to
contribute
one
would
group
them
together
quite
differently
to
make
a
tolerably
good
combination
but
as
soon
as
the
lost
pieces
are
retrieved
and
the
gap
in
the
faulty
combination
is
filled
there
will
ensue
a
beautiful
and
regular
thing
the
complete
large
square
this
perfect
combination
will
be
far
more
beautiful
than
the
tolerably
good
combination
which
had
been
made
from
the
pieces
one
had
not
mislaid
alone
the
perfect
combination
corresponds
to
the
universe
in
its
entirety
and
the
faulty
combination
that
is
a
part
of
the
perfect
one
corresponds
to
some
part
of
the
universe
where
we
find
defects
which
the
author
of
things
has
allowed
because
otherwise
if
he
had
wished
to
this
faulty
part
and
make
thereof
a
tolerably
good
combination
the
whole
would
not
then
have
been
so
beautiful
for
the
parts
of
the
faulty
combination
grouped
better
to
make
a
tolerably
good
combination
could
not
have
been
used
properly
to
form
the
whole
and
perfect
combination
thomas
aquinas
had
an
inkling
of
these
things
when
he
said
prudentem
gubernatorem
pertinet
negligere
aliquem
defectum
bonitatis
in
parte
ut
faciat
augmentum
bonitatis
in
lib
thomas
gatacre
in
his
notes
on
the
book
of
marcus
aurelius
lib
cap
with
bayle
cites
also
passages
from
authors
who
say
that
the
evil
of
the
parts
is
often
the
good
of
the
whole
let
us
return
to
bayle
illustrations
he
imagines
a
prince
who
is
having
a
city
built
and
who
in
bad
taste
aims
rather
at
airs
of
magnificence
therein
and
a
bold
and
unusual
style
of
architecture
than
at
the
provision
of
conveniences
of
all
kinds
for
the
inhabitants
but
if
this
prince
has
true
magnanimity
he
will
prefer
the
convenient
to
the
magnificent
architecture
that
is
bayle
judgement
i
consider
however
that
there
are
cases
where
one
will
justifiably
prefer
beauty
of
construction
in
a
palace
to
the
convenience
of
a
few
domestics
but
i
admit
that
the
construction
would
be
bad
however
beautiful
it
might
be
if
it
were
a
cause
of
diseases
to
the
inhabitants
provided
it
was
possible
to
make
one
that
would
be
better
taking
into
account
beauty
convenience
and
health
all
together
it
may
be
indeed
that
one
can
not
have
all
these
advantages
at
once
thus
supposing
one
wished
to
build
on
the
northern
and
more
bracing
side
of
the
mountain
if
the
castle
were
then
bound
to
be
of
an
unendurable
construction
one
would
prefer
to
make
it
face
southward
bayle
raises
the
further
objection
that
it
is
true
that
our
legislators
can
never
invent
regulations
such
as
are
convenient
for
all
individuals
lex
satis
commoda
omnibus
est
id
modo
quaeritur
si
majori
parti
et
in
summam
prodest
cato
apud
livium
circa
init
but
the
reason
is
that
the
limited
condition
of
their
knowledge
compels
them
to
cling
to
laws
which
when
all
is
taken
into
account
are
more
advantageous
than
harmful
nothing
of
all
that
can
apply
to
god
who
is
as
infinite
in
power
and
understanding
as
in
goodness
and
true
greatness
i
answer
that
since
god
chooses
the
best
possible
one
can
not
tax
him
with
any
limitation
of
his
perfections
and
in
the
universe
not
only
does
the
good
exceed
the
evil
but
also
the
evil
serves
to
augment
the
good
he
observes
also
that
the
stoics
derived
a
blasphemy
from
this
principle
saying
that
evils
must
be
endured
with
patience
or
that
they
were
necessary
not
only
to
the
and
completeness
of
the
universe
but
also
to
the
felicity
perfection
and
conservation
of
god
who
directs
it
the
emperor
marcus
aurelius
gave
expression
to
that
in
the
eighth
chapter
of
the
fifth
book
of
his
ratione
he
says
oportet
quidquid
evenerit
tibi
altera
quod
tibi
natum
et
tibi
coordinatum
et
ad
te
quodammodo
affectum
est

greek
tês

kai
tês

ex

this
precept
is
not
the
most
reasonable
of
those
stated
by
that
great
emperor
a
greek
stergein
chrê
is
of
no
avail
a
thing
does
not
become
pleasing
just
because
it
is
necessary
and
because
it
is
destined
for
or
attached
to
someone
and
what
for
me
would
be
an
evil
would
not
cease
to
be
such
because
it
would
be
my
master
good
unless
this
good
reflected
back
on
me
one
good
thing
among
others
in
the
universe
is
that
the
general
good
becomes
in
reality
the
individual
good
of
those
who
love
the
author
of
all
good
but
the
principal
error
of
this
emperor
and
of
the
stoics
was
their
assumption
that
the
good
of
the
universe
must
please
god
himself
because
they
imagined
god
as
the
soul
of
the
world
this
error
has
nothing
in
common
with
my
dogma
according
to
which
god
is
as
martianus
capella
calls
him
or
rather
further
he
acts
to
do
good
and
not
to
receive
it
est
dare
quam
his
bliss
is
ever
perfect
and
can
receive
no
increase
either
from
within
or
from
without
i
come
now
to
the
principal
objection
bayle
after
arnauld
brings
up
against
me
it
is
complicated
they
maintain
that
god
would
be
under
compulsion
that
he
would
act
of
necessity
if
he
were
bound
to
create
the
best
or
at
least
that
he
would
have
been
lacking
in
power
if
he
could
not
have
found
a
better
expedient
for
excluding
sins
and
other
evils
that
is
in
effect
denying
that
this
universe
is
the
best
and
that
god
is
bound
to
insist
upon
the
best
i
have
met
this
objection
adequately
in
more
than
one
passage
i
have
proved
that
god
can
not
fail
to
produce
the
best
and
from
that
assumption
it
follows
that
the
evils
we
experience
could
not
have
been
reasonably
excluded
from
the
universe
since
they
are
there
let
us
see
however
what
these
two
excellent
men
bring
up
or
rather
let
us
see
what
bayle
objection
is
for
he
professes
to
have
profited
by
the
arguments
of
arnauld
it
be
possible
he
says
to
the
questions
of
a
vol
iii
ch
a
nature
whose
goodness
holiness
wisdom
knowledge
and
power
are
infinite
who
loves
virtue
supremely
and
hates
vice
supremely
as
our
clear
and
distinct
idea
of
him
shows
us
and
as
every
page
of
scripture
assures
us
could
have
found
in
virtue
no
means
fitting
and
suited
for
his
ends
would
it
be
possible
that
vice
alone
had
offered
him
this
means
one
would
have
thought
on
the
contrary
that
nothing
beseemed
this
nature
more
than
to
establish
virtue
in
his
work
to
the
exclusion
of
all
vice
bayle
here
exaggerates
things
i
agree
that
some
vice
was
connected
with
the
best
plan
of
the
universe
but
i
do
not
agree
with
him
that
god
could
not
find
in
virtue
any
means
suited
for
his
ends
this
objection
would
have
been
valid
if
there
were
no
virtue
if
vice
took
its
place
everywhere
he
will
say
it
suffices
that
vice
prevails
and
that
virtue
is
trifling
in
comparison
but
i
am
far
from
agreeing
with
him
there
and
i
think
that
in
reality
properly
speaking
there
is
incomparably
more
moral
good
than
moral
evil
in
rational
creatures
and
of
these
we
have
knowledge
of
but
few
this
evil
is
not
even
so
great
in
men
as
it
is
declared
to
be
it
is
only
people
of
a
malicious
disposition
or
those
who
have
become
somewhat
misanthropic
through
misfortunes
like
lucian
timon
who
find
wickedness
everywhere
and
who
poison
the
best
actions
by
the
interpretations
they
give
to
them
i
speak
of
those
who
do
it
in
all
seriousness
to
draw
thence
evil
conclusions
by
which
their
conduct
is
tainted
for
there
are
some
who
only
do
it
to
show
off
their
own
acumen
people
have
found
that
fault
in
tacitus
and
that
again
is
the
criticism
descartes
in
one
of
his
letters
makes
of
hobbes
book
of
which
only
a
few
copies
had
at
that
time
been
printed
for
distribution
among
friends
but
to
which
some
notes
by
the
author
were
added
in
the
second
edition
which
we
have
for
although
descartes
acknowledges
that
this
book
is
by
a
man
of
talent
he
observes
therein
some
very
dangerous
principles
and
maxims
in
the
assumption
there
made
that
all
men
are
wicked
or
the
provision
of
them
with
motives
for
being
so
the
late
herr
jacob
thomasius
said
in
his
admirable
of
practical
that
the
greek
prôton
pseudos
the
primary
cause
of
errors
in
this
book
by
hobbes
was
that
he
took
legalem
pro
that
is
to
say
that
the
corrupt
state
served
him
as
a
gauge
and
rule
whereas
it
is
the
state
most
befitting
human
nature
which
aristotle
had
had
in
view
for
according
to
aristotle
that
is
termed
which
conforms
most
closely
to
the
perfection
of
the
nature
of
the
thing
but
hobbes
applies
the
term
to
that
which
has
least
art
perhaps
not
taking
into
account
that
human
nature
in
its
perfection
carries
art
with
it
but
the
question
of
name
that
is
to
say
of
what
may
be
called
natural
would
not
be
of
great
importance
were
it
not
that
aristotle
and
hobbes
fastened
upon
it
the
notion
of
natural
right
each
one
following
his
own
signification
i
have
said
here
already
that
i
found
in
the
book
on
the
falsity
of
human
virtues
the
same
defect
as
descartes
found
in
hobbes
but
even
if
we
assume
that
vice
exceeds
virtue
in
the
human
kind
as
it
is
assumed
the
number
of
the
damned
exceeds
that
of
the
elect
it
by
no
means
follows
that
vice
and
misery
exceed
virtue
and
happiness
in
the
universe
one
should
rather
believe
the
opposite
because
the
city
of
god
must
be
the
most
perfect
of
all
possible
states
since
it
was
formed
and
is
perpetually
governed
by
the
greatest
and
best
of
all
monarchs
this
answer
confirms
the
observation
i
made
earlier
when
speaking
of
the
conformity
of
faith
with
reason
namely
that
one
of
the
greatest
sources
of
fallacy
in
the
objections
is
the
confusion
of
the
apparent
with
the
real
and
here
by
the
apparent
i
mean
not
simply
such
as
would
result
from
an
exact
discussion
of
facts
but
that
which
has
been
derived
from
the
small
extent
of
our
experiences
it
would
be
senseless
to
try
to
bring
up
appearances
so
imperfect
and
having
such
slight
foundation
in
opposition
to
the
proofs
of
reason
and
the
revelations
of
faith
finally
i
have
already
observed
that
love
of
virtue
and
hatred
of
vice
which
tend
in
an
undefined
way
to
bring
virtue
into
existence
and
to
prevent
the
existence
of
vice
are
only
antecedent
acts
of
will
such
as
is
the
will
to
bring
about
the
happiness
of
all
men
and
to
save
them
from
misery
these
acts
of
antecedent
will
make
up
only
a
portion
of
all
the
antecedent
will
of
god
taken
together
whose
result
forms
the
consequent
will
or
the
decree
to
create
the
best
through
this
decree
it
is
that
love
for
virtue
and
for
the
happiness
of
rational
creatures
which
is
undefined
in
itself
and
goes
as
far
as
is
possible
receives
some
slight
limitations
on
account
of
the
heed
that
must
be
paid
to
good
in
general
thus
one
must
understand
that
god
loves
virtue
supremely
and
hates
vice
supremely
and
that
nevertheless
some
vice
is
to
be
permitted
arnauld
and
bayle
appear
to
maintain
that
this
method
of
explaining
things
and
of
establishing
a
best
among
all
the
plans
for
the
universe
one
such
as
may
not
be
surpassed
by
any
other
sets
a
limit
to
god
power
you
considered
says
arnauld
to
father
malebranche
in
his
on
the
new
system
of
nature
and
vol
ii
in
making
such
assumptions
you
take
it
upon
yourself
to
subvert
the
first
article
of
the
creed
whereby
we
make
profession
of
believing
in
god
the
father
almighty
he
had
said
already
one
maintain
without
trying
to
blind
oneself
that
a
course
of
action
which
could
not
fail
to
have
this
grievous
result
namely
that
the
majority
of
men
perish
bears
the
stamp
of
god
goodness
more
than
a
different
course
of
action
which
would
have
caused
if
god
had
followed
it
the
salvation
of
all
men
and
as
jacquelot
does
not
differ
from
the
principles
i
have
just
laid
down
bayle
raises
like
objections
in
his
case
to
the
questions
of
a
vol
iii
ch
one
adopts
such
explanations
he
says
sees
oneself
constrained
to
renounce
the
most
obvious
notions
on
the
nature
of
the
supremely
perfect
being
these
teach
us
that
all
things
not
implying
contradiction
are
possible
for
him
that
consequently
it
is
possible
for
him
to
save
people
whom
he
does
not
save
for
what
contradiction
would
result
supposing
the
number
of
the
elect
were
greater
than
it
is
they
teach
us
besides
that
since
he
is
supremely
happy
he
has
no
will
which
he
can
not
carry
out
how
then
shall
we
understand
that
he
wills
to
save
all
men
and
that
he
can
not
do
so
we
sought
some
light
to
help
us
out
of
the
perplexities
we
feel
in
comparing
the
idea
of
god
with
the
state
of
the
human
kind
and
lo
we
are
given
elucidations
that
cast
us
into
darkness
more
dense
all
these
obstacles
vanish
before
the
exposition
i
have
just
given
i
agree
with
bayle
principle
and
it
is
also
mine
that
everything
implying
no
contradiction
is
possible
but
as
for
me
holding
as
i
do
that
god
did
the
best
that
was
possible
or
that
he
could
not
have
done
better
than
he
has
done
deeming
also
that
to
pass
any
other
judgement
upon
his
work
in
its
entirety
would
be
to
wrong
his
goodness
or
his
wisdom
i
must
say
that
to
make
something
which
surpasses
in
goodness
the
best
itself
that
indeed
would
imply
contradiction
that
would
be
as
if
someone
maintained
that
god
could
draw
from
one
point
to
another
a
line
shorter
than
the
straight
line
and
accused
those
who
deny
this
of
subverting
the
article
of
faith
whereby
we
believe
in
god
the
father
almighty
the
infinity
of
possibles
however
great
it
may
be
is
no
greater
than
that
of
the
wisdom
of
god
who
knows
all
possibles
one
may
even
say
that
if
this
wisdom
does
not
exceed
the
possibles
extensively
since
the
objects
of
the
understanding
can
not
go
beyond
the
possible
which
in
a
sense
is
alone
intelligible
it
exceeds
them
intensively
by
reason
of
the
infinitely
infinite
combinations
it
makes
thereof
and
its
many
deliberations
concerning
them
the
wisdom
of
god
not
content
with
embracing
all
the
possibles
penetrates
them
compares
them
weighs
them
one
against
the
other
to
estimate
their
degrees
of
perfection
or
imperfection
the
strong
and
the
weak
the
good
and
the
evil
it
goes
even
beyond
the
finite
combinations
it
makes
of
them
an
infinity
of
infinites
that
is
to
say
an
infinity
of
possible
sequences
of
the
universe
each
of
which
contains
an
infinity
of
creatures
by
this
means
the
divine
wisdom
distributes
all
the
possibles
it
had
already
contemplated
separately
into
so
many
universal
systems
which
it
further
compares
the
one
with
the
other
the
result
of
all
these
comparisons
and
deliberations
is
the
choice
of
the
best
from
among
all
these
possible
systems
which
wisdom
makes
in
order
to
satisfy
goodness
completely
and
such
is
precisely
the
plan
of
the
universe
as
it
is
moreover
all
these
operations
of
the
divine
understanding
although
they
have
among
them
an
order
and
a
priority
of
nature
always
take
place
together
no
priority
of
time
existing
among
them
the
careful
consideration
of
these
things
will
i
hope
induce
a
different
idea
of
the
greatness
of
the
divine
perfections
and
especially
of
the
wisdom
and
goodness
of
god
from
any
that
can
exist
in
the
minds
of
those
who
make
god
act
at
random
without
cause
or
reason
and
i
do
not
see
how
they
could
avoid
falling
into
an
opinion
so
strange
unless
they
acknowledged
that
there
are
reasons
for
god
choice
and
that
these
reasons
are
derived
from
his
goodness
whence
it
follows
of
necessity
that
what
was
chosen
had
the
advantage
of
goodness
over
what
was
not
chosen
and
consequently
that
it
is
the
best
of
all
the
possibles
the
best
can
not
be
surpassed
in
goodness
and
it
is
no
restriction
of
the
power
of
god
to
say
that
he
can
not
do
the
impossible
is
it
possible
said
bayle
that
there
is
no
better
plan
than
that
one
which
god
carried
out
one
answers
that
it
is
very
possible
and
indeed
necessary
namely
that
there
is
none
otherwise
god
would
have
preferred
it
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
proved
sufficiently
that
among
all
the
possible
plans
of
the
universe
there
is
one
better
than
all
the
rest
and
that
god
has
not
failed
to
choose
it
but
bayle
claims
to
infer
thence
that
god
is
therefore
not
free
this
is
how
he
speaks
on
that
question
ch
thought
to
argue
with
a
man
who
assumed
as
i
do
that
the
goodness
and
the
power
of
god
are
infinite
as
well
as
his
wisdom
and
now
i
see
that
in
reality
this
man
assumes
that
god
goodness
and
power
are
enclosed
within
rather
narrow
bounds
as
to
that
the
objection
has
already
been
met
i
set
no
bounds
to
god
power
since
i
recognize
that
it
extends
maximum
ad
to
all
that
implies
no
contradiction
and
i
set
none
to
his
goodness
since
it
attains
to
the
best
but
bayle
goes
on
is
therefore
no
freedom
in
god
he
is
compelled
by
his
wisdom
to
create
and
then
to
create
precisely
such
a
work
and
finally
to
create
it
precisely
in
such
ways
these
are
three
servitudes
which
form
a
more
than
stoic
and
which
render
impossible
all
that
is
not
within
their
sphere
it
seems
that
according
to
this
system
god
could
have
said
even
before
shaping
his
decrees
i
can
not
save
such
and
such
a
man
nor
condemn
such
and
such
another
vetor
my
wisdom
permits
it
not
i
answer
that
it
is
goodness
which
prompts
god
to
create
with
the
purpose
of
communicating
himself
and
this
same
goodness
combined
with
wisdom
prompts
him
to
create
the
best
a
best
that
includes
the
whole
sequence
the
effect
and
the
process
it
prompts
him
thereto
without
compelling
him
for
it
does
not
render
impossible
that
which
it
does
not
cause
him
to
choose
to
call
that
is
taking
it
in
a
good
sense
which
is
not
contrary
to
freedom
comes
from
to
speak
to
pronounce
it
signifies
a
judgement
a
decree
of
god
the
award
of
his
wisdom
to
say
that
one
can
not
do
a
thing
simply
because
one
does
not
will
it
is
to
misuse
terms
the
wise
mind
wills
only
the
good
is
it
then
a
servitude
when
the
will
acts
in
accordance
with
wisdom
and
can
one
be
less
a
slave
than
to
act
by
one
own
choice
in
accordance
with
the
most
perfect
reason
aristotle
used
to
say
that
that
man
is
in
a
natural
servitude
who
lacks
guidance
who
has
need
of
being
directed
slavery
comes
from
without
it
leads
to
that
which
offends
and
especially
to
that
which
offends
with
reason
the
force
of
others
and
our
own
passions
enslave
us
god
is
never
moved
by
anything
outside
himself
nor
is
he
subject
to
inward
passions
and
he
is
never
led
to
that
which
can
cause
him
offence
it
appears
therefore
that
bayle
gives
odious
names
to
the
best
things
in
the
world
and
turns
our
ideas
applying
the
term
slavery
to
the
state
of
the
greatest
and
most
perfect
freedom
he
had
also
said
not
long
before
ch
virtue
or
any
other
good
at
all
had
been
as
appropriate
as
vice
for
the
creator
ends
vice
would
not
have
been
given
preference
it
must
therefore
have
been
the
only
means
that
the
creator
could
have
used
it
was
therefore
employed
purely
of
necessity
as
therefore
he
loves
his
glory
not
with
a
freedom
of
indifference
but
by
necessity
he
must
by
necessity
love
all
the
means
without
which
he
could
not
manifest
his
glory
now
if
vice
as
vice
was
the
only
means
of
attaining
to
this
end
it
will
follow
that
god
of
necessity
loves
vice
as
vice
a
thought
which
can
only
inspire
us
with
horror
and
he
has
revealed
quite
the
contrary
to
us
he
observes
at
the
same
time
that
certain
doctors
among
the
supralapsarians
like
rutherford
for
example
denied
that
god
wills
sin
as
sin
whilst
they
admitted
that
he
wills
sin
permissively
in
so
far
as
it
is
punishable
and
pardonable
but
he
urges
in
objection
that
an
action
is
only
punishable
and
pardonable
in
so
far
as
it
is
vicious
bayle
makes
a
false
assumption
in
these
words
that
we
have
just
read
and
draws
from
them
false
conclusions
it
is
not
true
that
god
loves
his
glory
by
necessity
if
thereby
it
is
understood
that
he
is
led
by
necessity
to
acquire
his
glory
through
his
creatures
for
if
that
were
so
he
would
acquire
his
glory
always
and
everywhere
the
decree
to
create
is
free
god
is
prompted
to
all
good
the
good
and
even
the
best
inclines
him
to
act
but
it
does
not
compel
him
for
his
choice
creates
no
impossibility
in
that
which
is
distinct
from
the
best
it
causes
no
implication
of
contradiction
in
that
which
god
refrains
from
doing
there
is
therefore
in
god
a
freedom
that
is
exempt
not
only
from
constraint
but
also
from
necessity
i
mean
this
in
respect
of
metaphysical
necessity
for
it
is
a
moral
necessity
that
the
wisest
should
be
bound
to
choose
the
best
it
is
the
same
with
the
means
which
god
chooses
to
attain
his
glory
and
as
for
vice
it
has
been
shown
in
preceding
pages
that
it
is
not
an
object
of
god
decree
as
but
as
sine
qua
and
that
for
that
reason
alone
it
is
permitted
one
is
even
less
justified
in
saying
that
vice
is
only
it
would
be
at
most
one
of
the
means
but
one
of
the
least
among
innumerable
others
frightful
consequence
bayle
goes
on
fatality
of
all
things
ensues
god
will
not
have
been
free
to
arrange
events
in
a
different
way
since
the
means
he
chose
to
show
forth
his
glory
was
the
only
means
befitting
his
wisdom
this
fatality
or
necessity
is
only
moral
as
i
have
just
shown
it
does
not
affect
freedom
on
the
contrary
it
assumes
the
best
use
thereof
it
does
not
render
impossible
the
objects
set
aside
by
god
choice
then
will
become
he
adds
man
free
will
will
there
not
have
been
necessity
and
fatality
for
adam
to
sin
for
if
he
had
not
sinned
he
would
have
overthrown
the
sole
plan
that
god
had
of
necessity
created
that
is
again
a
misuse
of
terms
adam
sinning
freely
was
seen
of
god
among
the
ideas
of
the
possibles
and
god
decreed
to
admit
him
into
existence
as
he
saw
him
this
decree
does
not
change
the
nature
of
the
objects
it
does
not
render
necessary
that
which
was
contingent
in
itself
or
impossible
that
which
was
possible
bayle
goes
on
subtle
scotus
asserts
with
much
discernment
that
if
god
had
no
freedom
of
indifference
no
creature
could
have
this
kind
of
freedom
i
agree
provided
it
is
not
meant
as
an
indifference
of
equipoise
where
there
is
no
reason
inclining
more
to
one
side
than
the
other
bayle
acknowledges
farther
on
in
chapter
that
what
is
termed
indifference
does
not
exclude
prevenient
inclinations
and
pleasures
it
suffices
therefore
that
there
be
no
metaphysical
necessity
in
the
action
which
is
termed
free
that
is
to
say
it
suffices
that
a
choice
be
made
between
several
courses
possible
he
goes
on
again
in
the
said
chapter
god
is
not
determined
to
create
the
world
by
a
free
motion
of
his
goodness
but
by
the
interests
of
his
glory
which
he
loves
by
necessity
and
which
is
the
only
thing
he
loves
for
it
is
not
different
from
his
substance
and
if
the
love
that
he
has
for
himself
has
compelled
him
to
show
forth
his
glory
through
the
most
fitting
means
and
if
the
fall
of
man
was
this
same
means
it
is
evident
that
this
fall
happened
entirely
by
necessity
and
that
the
obedience
of
eve
and
adam
to
god
commands
was
impossible
still
the
same
error
the
love
that
god
bears
to
himself
is
essential
to
him
but
the
love
for
his
glory
or
the
will
to
acquire
his
glory
is
not
so
by
any
means
the
love
he
has
for
himself
did
not
impel
him
by
necessity
to
actions
without
they
were
free
and
since
there
were
possible
plans
whereby
the
first
parents
should
not
sin
their
sin
was
therefore
not
necessary
finally
i
say
in
effect
what
bayle
acknowledges
here
god
resolved
to
create
the
world
by
a
free
motion
of
his
goodness
and
i
add
that
this
same
motion
prompted
him
to
the
best
the
same
answer
holds
good
against
this
statement
of
bayle
ch
means
most
appropriate
for
attaining
an
end
is
of
necessity
one
alone
that
is
very
well
said
at
least
for
the
cases
where
god
has
chosen
if
god
was
prompted
irresistibly
to
employ
this
means
he
employed
it
by
necessity
he
was
certainly
prompted
thereto
he
was
determined
or
rather
he
determined
himself
thereto
but
that
which
is
certain
is
not
always
necessary
or
altogether
irresistible
the
thing
might
have
gone
otherwise
but
that
did
not
happen
and
with
good
reason
god
chose
between
different
courses
all
possible
thus
metaphysically
speaking
he
could
have
chosen
or
done
what
was
not
the
best
but
he
could
not
morally
speaking
have
done
so
let
us
make
use
of
a
comparison
from
geometry
the
best
way
from
one
point
to
another
leaving
out
of
account
obstacles
and
other
considerations
accidental
to
the
medium
is
one
alone
it
is
that
one
which
passes
by
the
shortest
line
which
is
the
straight
line
yet
there
are
innumerable
ways
from
one
point
to
another
there
is
therefore
no
necessity
which
binds
me
to
go
by
the
straight
line
but
as
soon
as
i
choose
the
best
i
am
determined
to
go
that
way
although
this
is
only
a
moral
necessity
in
the
wise
that
is
why
the
following
conclusions
fail
he
could
only
do
that
which
he
did
therefore
that
which
has
not
happened
or
will
never
happen
is
absolutely
impossible
these
conclusions
fail
i
say
for
since
there
are
many
things
which
have
never
happened
and
never
will
happen
and
which
nevertheless
are
clearly
conceivable
and
imply
no
contradiction
how
can
one
say
they
are
altogether
impossible
bayle
has
refuted
that
himself
in
a
passage
opposing
the
spinozists
which
i
have
already
quoted
here
and
he
has
frequently
acknowledged
that
there
is
nothing
impossible
except
that
which
implies
contradiction
now
he
changes
style
and
terminology
adam
perseverance
in
innocence
was
always
impossible
therefore
his
fall
was
altogether
inevitable
and
even
antecedently
to
god
decree
for
it
implied
contradiction
that
god
should
be
able
to
will
a
thing
opposed
to
his
wisdom
it
is
after
all
the
same
thing
to
say
that
it
is
impossible
for
god
as
to
say
god
could
do
it
if
he
so
willed
but
he
can
not
will
it
it
is
misusing
terms
in
a
sense
to
say
here
one
can
will
one
will
will
here
concerns
the
actions
that
one
does
will
nevertheless
it
implies
no
contradiction
that
god
should
will
directly
or
permissively
a
thing
not
implying
contradiction
and
in
this
sense
it
is
permitted
to
say
that
god
can
will
it
in
a
word
when
one
speaks
of
the
of
a
thing
it
is
not
a
question
of
the
causes
that
can
bring
about
or
prevent
its
actual
existence
otherwise
one
would
change
the
nature
of
the
terms
and
render
useless
the
distinction
between
the
possible
and
the
actual
this
abelard
did
and
wyclif
appears
to
have
done
after
him
in
consequence
of
which
they
fell
needlessly
into
unsuitable
and
disagreeable
expressions
that
is
why
when
one
asks
if
a
thing
is
possible
or
necessary
and
brings
in
the
consideration
of
what
god
wills
or
chooses
one
alters
the
issue
for
god
chooses
among
the
possibles
and
for
that
very
reason
he
chooses
freely
and
is
not
compelled
there
would
be
neither
choice
nor
freedom
if
there
were
but
one
course
possible
one
must
also
answer
bayle
syllogisms
so
as
to
neglect
none
of
the
objections
of
a
man
so
gifted

occur
in

of
his

the
questions

the
major
is

one
can

whereof
the
opposite
is

but
the

can
not
be
accepted
for
albeit
god
loves
his

the
actions
whereto
his

prompts
him
can
not
but
be
free
and
the
objects
whereto
his

does
not
prompt
him
do
not
cease
to
be
possible
moreover
his
wisdom
has
prompted
him
to
will
the
salvation
of
all

but
not
by
a
consequent
and
decretory

yet
this

the

the

i
deny
the

of

are
always
free
even
though
god
be
always
prompted
thereto
by
reasons
which
lie
in
the
intention
towards
good
for
to
be
morally
compelled
by
wisdom
to
be
bound
by
the
consideration
of
good
is
to
be
free
it
is
not
compulsion
in
the
metaphysical
sense
and
metaphysical
necessity
alone
as
i
have
observed
so
many
times
is
opposed
to
freedom
i
shall
not
examine
the
syllogisms
that
bayle
urges
in
objection
in
the
following
chapter
ch
against
the
system
of
the
supralapsarians
and
particularly
against
the
oration
made
by
theodore
de
bèze
at
the
conference
of
montbéliard
in
the
year
this
conference
also
only
served
to
increase
the
acrimony
of
the
parties
created
the
world
to
his
glory
his
glory
is
not
known
according
to
bèze
if
his
mercy
and
his
justice
are
not
declared
for
this
cause
simply
by
his
grace
he
decreed
for
some
men
life
eternal
and
for
others
by
a
just
judgement
eternal
damnation
mercy
presupposes
misery
justice
presupposes
guilt
he
might
have
added
that
misery
also
supposes
guilt
god
being
good
indeed
goodness
itself
he
created
man
good
and
righteous
but
unstable
and
capable
of
sinning
of
his
own
free
will
man
did
not
fall
at
random
or
rashly
or
through
causes
ordained
by
some
other
god
as
the
manichaeans
hold
but
by
the
providence
of
god
in
such
a
way
notwithstanding
that
god
was
not
involved
in
the
fault
inasmuch
as
man
was
not
constrained
to
sin
this
system
is
not
of
the
best
conceived
it
is
not
well
fitted
to
show
forth
the
wisdom
the
goodness
and
the
justice
of
god
and
happily
it
is
almost
abandoned
if
there
were
not
other
more
profound
reasons
capable
of
inducing
god
to
permit
guilt
the
source
of
misery
there
would
be
neither
guilt
nor
misery
in
the
world
for
the
reasons
alleged
here
do
not
suffice
he
would
declare
his
mercy
better
in
preventing
misery
and
he
would
declare
his
justice
better
in
preventing
guilt
in
advancing
virtue
in
recompensing
it
besides
one
does
not
see
how
he
who
not
only
causes
a
man
to
be
capable
of
falling
but
who
so
disposes
circumstances
that
they
contribute
towards
causing
his
fall
is
not
culpable
if
there
are
no
other
reasons
compelling
him
thereto
but
when
one
considers
that
god
altogether
good
and
wise
must
have
produced
all
the
virtue
goodness
happiness
whereof
the
best
plan
of
the
universe
is
capable
and
that
often
an
evil
in
some
parts
may
serve
the
greater
good
of
the
whole
one
readily
concludes
that
god
may
have
given
room
for
unhappiness
and
even
permitted
guilt
as
he
has
done
without
deserving
to
be
blamed
it
is
the
only
remedy
that
supplies
what
all
systems
lack
however
they
arrange
the
decrees
these
thoughts
have
already
been
favoured
by
augustine
and
one
may
say
of
eve
what
the
poet
said
of
the
hand
of
mucius
scaevola
non
errasset
fecerat
illa
i
find
that
the
famous
english
prelate
who
wrote
an
ingenious
book
on
the
origin
of
evil
some
passages
of
which
were
disputed
by
bayle
in
the
second
volume
of
his
to
the
questions
of
a
while
disagreeing
with
some
of
the
opinions
that
i
have
upheld
here
and
appearing
to
resort
sometimes
to
a
despotic
power
as
if
the
will
of
god
did
not
follow
the
rules
of
wisdom
in
relation
to
good
or
evil
but
decreed
arbitrarily
that
such
and
such
a
thing
must
be
considered
good
or
evil
and
as
if
even
the
will
of
the
creature
in
so
far
as
it
is
free
did
not
choose
because
the
object
appears
good
to
him
but
by
a
purely
arbitrary
determination
independent
of
the
representation
of
the
object
this
bishop
i
say
in
other
passages
nevertheless
says
things
which
seem
more
in
favour
of
my
doctrine
than
of
what
appears
contrary
thereto
in
his
own
he
says
that
what
an
infinitely
wise
and
free
cause
has
chosen
is
better
than
what
it
has
not
chosen
is
not
that
recognizing
that
goodness
is
the
object
and
the
reason
of
his
choice
in
this
sense
one
will
here
aptly
say
placuit
superis
quaerere
plura
essays
on
the
justice
of
god
and
the
freedom
of
man
in
the
origin
of
evil
part
three
now
at
last
i
have
disposed
of
the
cause
of
moral
evil
that
is
sorrows
sufferings
miseries
will
be
less
troublesome
to
explain
since
these
are
results
of
moral
evil
est
malum
passionis
quod
infligitur
ob
malum
according
to
grotius
one
suffers
because
one
has
acted
one
suffers
evil
because
one
does
evil
causa
it
is
true
that
one
often
suffers
through
the
evil
actions
of
others
but
when
one
has
no
part
in
the
offence
one
must
look
upon
it
as
a
certainty
that
these
sufferings
prepare
for
us
a
greater
happiness
the
question
of
that
is
of
the
origin
of
sufferings
has
difficulties
in
common
with
that
of
the
origin
of
examples
whereof
are
furnished
by
the
monstrosities
and
other
apparent
irregularities
of
the
universe
but
one
must
believe
that
even
sufferings
and
monstrosities
are
part
of
order
and
it
is
well
to
bear
in
mind
not
only
that
it
was
better
to
admit
these
defects
and
these
monstrosities
than
to
violate
general
laws
as
father
malebranche
sometimes
argues
but
also
that
these
very
monstrosities
are
in
the
rules
and
are
in
conformity
with
general
acts
of
will
though
we
be
not
capable
of
discerning
this
conformity
it
is
just
as
sometimes
there
are
appearances
of
irregularity
in
mathematics
which
issue
finally
in
a
great
order
when
one
has
finally
got
to
the
bottom
of
them
that
is
why
i
have
already
in
this
work
observed
that
according
to
my
principles
all
individual
events
without
exception
are
consequences
of
general
acts
of
will
it
should
be
no
cause
for
astonishment
that
i
endeavour
to
elucidate
these
things
by
comparisons
taken
from
pure
mathematics
where
everything
proceeds
in
order
and
where
it
is
possible
to
fathom
them
by
a
close
contemplation
which
grants
us
an
enjoyment
so
to
speak
of
the
vision
of
the
ideas
of
god
one
may
propose
a
succession
or
series
of
numbers
perfectly
irregular
to
all
appearance
where
the
numbers
increase
and
diminish
variably
without
the
emergence
of
any
order
and
yet
he
who
knows
the
key
to
the
formula
and
who
understands
the
origin
and
the
structure
of
this
succession
of
numbers
will
be
able
to
give
a
rule
which
being
properly
understood
will
show
that
the
series
is
perfectly
regular
and
that
it
even
has
excellent
properties
one
may
make
this
still
more
evident
in
lines
a
line
may
have
twists
and
turns
ups
and
downs
points
of
reflexion
and
points
of
inflexion
interruptions
and
other
variations
so
that
one
sees
neither
rhyme
nor
reason
therein
especially
when
taking
into
account
only
a
portion
of
the
line
and
yet
it
may
be
that
one
can
give
its
equation
and
construction
wherein
a
geometrician
would
find
the
reason
and
the
fittingness
of
all
these
irregularities
that
is
how
we
must
look
upon
the
irregularities
constituted
by
monstrosities
and
other
defects
in
the
universe
in
this
sense
one
may
apply
that
fine
adage
of
bernard
ep
ad
iii
est
minus
interdum
ordinate
fieri
aliquid
it
belongs
to
the
great
order
that
there
should
be
some
small
disorder
one
may
even
say
that
this
small
disorder
is
apparent
only
in
the
whole
and
it
is
not
even
apparent
when
one
considers
the
happiness
of
those
who
walk
in
the
ways
of
order
when
i
mention
monstrosities
i
include
numerous
other
apparent
defects
besides
we
are
acquainted
with
hardly
anything
but
the
surface
of
our
globe
we
scarce
penetrate
into
its
interior
beyond
a
few
hundred
fathoms
that
which
we
find
in
this
crust
of
the
globe
appears
to
be
the
effect
of
some
great
upheavals
it
seems
that
this
globe
was
once
on
fire
and
that
the
rocks
forming
the
base
of
this
crust
of
the
earth
are
scoria
remaining
from
a
great
fusion
in
their
entrails
are
found
metal
and
mineral
products
which
closely
resemble
those
emanating
from
our
furnaces
and
the
entire
sea
may
be
a
kind
of
per
just
as
tartaric
oil
forms
in
a
damp
place
for
when
the
earth
surface
cooled
after
the
great
conflagration
the
moisture
that
the
fire
had
driven
into
the
air
fell
back
upon
the
earth
washed
its
surface
and
dissolved
and
absorbed
the
solid
salt
that
was
left
in
the
cinders
finally
filling
up
this
great
cavity
in
the
surface
of
our
globe
to
form
the
ocean
filled
with
salt
water
but
after
the
fire
one
must
conclude
that
earth
and
water
made
ravages
no
less
it
may
be
that
the
crust
formed
by
the
cooling
having
below
it
great
cavities
fell
in
so
that
we
live
only
on
ruins
as
among
others
thomas
burnet
chaplain
to
the
late
king
of
great
britain
aptly
observed
sundry
deluges
and
inundations
have
left
deposits
whereof
traces
and
remains
are
found
which
show
that
the
sea
was
in
places
that
are
most
remote
from
it
but
these
upheavals
ceased
at
last
and
the
globe
assumed
the
shape
that
we
see
moses
hints
at
these
changes
in
few
words
the
separation
of
light
from
darkness
indicates
the
melting
caused
by
the
fire
and
the
separation
of
the
moist
from
the
dry
marks
the
effects
of
inundations
but
who
does
not
see
that
these
disorders
have
served
to
bring
things
to
the
point
where
they
now
are
that
we
owe
to
them
our
riches
and
our
comforts
and
that
through
their
agency
this
globe
became
fit
for
cultivation
by
us
these
disorders
passed
into
order
the
disorders
real
or
apparent
that
we
see
from
afar
are
sunspots
and
comets
but
we
do
not
know
what
uses
they
supply
nor
the
rules
prevailing
therein
time
was
when
the
planets
were
held
to
be
wandering
stars
now
their
motion
is
found
to
be
regular
peradventure
it
is
the
same
with
the
comets
posterity
will
know
one
does
not
include
among
the
disorders
inequality
of
conditions
and
jacquelot
is
justified
in
asking
those
who
would
have
everything
equally
perfect
why
rocks
are
not
crowned
with
leaves
and
flowers
why
ants
are
not
peacocks
and
if
there
must
needs
be
equality
everywhere
the
poor
man
would
serve
notice
of
appeal
against
the
rich
the
servant
against
the
master
the
pipes
of
an
organ
must
not
be
of
equal
size
bayle
will
say
that
there
is
a
difference
between
a
privation
of
good
and
a
disorder
between
a
disorder
in
inanimate
things
which
is
purely
metaphysical
and
a
disorder
in
rational
creatures
which
is
composed
of
crime
and
sufferings
he
is
right
in
making
a
distinction
between
them
and
i
am
right
in
combining
them
god
does
not
neglect
inanimate
things
they
do
not
feel
but
god
feels
for
them
he
does
not
neglect
animals
they
have
not
intelligence
but
god
has
it
for
them
he
would
reproach
himself
for
the
slightest
actual
defect
there
were
in
the
universe
even
though
it
were
perceived
of
none
it
seems
bayle
does
not
approve
any
comparison
between
the
disorders
which
may
exist
in
inanimate
things
and
those
which
trouble
the
peace
and
happiness
of
rational
creatures
nor
would
he
agree
to
our
justifying
the
permission
of
vice
on
the
pretext
of
the
care
that
must
be
taken
to
avoid
disturbing
the
laws
of
motion
one
might
thence
conclude
according
to
him
posthumous
reply
to
jacquelot
god
created
the
world
only
to
display
his
infinite
skill
in
architecture
and
mechanics
whilst
his
property
of
goodness
and
love
of
virtue
took
no
part
in
the
construction
of
this
great
work
this
god
would
pride
himself
only
on
skill
he
would
prefer
to
let
the
whole
human
kind
perish
rather
than
suffer
some
atoms
to
go
faster
or
more
slowly
than
general
laws
require
bayle
would
not
have
made
this
antithesis
if
he
had
been
informed
on
the
system
of
general
harmony
which
i
assume
which
states
that
the
realm
of
efficient
causes
and
that
of
final
causes
are
parallel
to
each
other
that
god
has
no
less
the
quality
of
the
best
monarch
than
that
of
the
greatest
architect
that
matter
is
so
disposed
that
the
laws
of
motion
serve
as
the
best
guidance
for
spirits
and
that
consequently
it
will
prove
that
he
has
attained
the
utmost
good
possible
provided
one
reckon
the
metaphysical
physical
and
moral
goods
together
but
bayle
will
say
god
having
power
to
avert
innumerable
evils
by
one
small
miracle
why
did
he
not
employ
it
he
gives
so
much
extraordinary
help
to
fallen
men
but
slight
help
of
such
a
kind
given
to
eve
would
have
prevented
her
fall
and
rendered
the
temptation
of
the
serpent
ineffective
i
have
sufficiently
met
objections
of
this
sort
with
this
general
answer
that
god
ought
not
to
make
choice
of
another
universe
since
he
has
chosen
the
best
and
has
only
made
use
of
the
miracles
necessary
thereto
i
had
answered
bayle
that
miracles
change
the
natural
order
of
the
universe
he
replies
that
that
is
an
illusion
and
that
the
miracle
of
the
wedding
at
cana
for
instance
made
no
change
in
the
air
of
the
room
except
that
instead
of
receiving
into
its
pores
some
corpuscles
of
water
it
received
corpuscles
of
wine
but
one
must
bear
in
mind
that
once
the
best
plan
of
things
has
been
chosen
nothing
can
be
changed
therein
as
for
miracles
concerning
which
i
have
already
said
something
in
this
work
they
are
perhaps
not
all
of
one
and
the
same
kind
there
are
many
to
all
appearances
which
god
brings
about
through
the
ministry
of
invisible
substances
such
as
the
angels
as
father
malebranche
also
believes
these
angels
or
these
substances
act
according
to
the
ordinary
laws
of
their
nature
being
combined
with
bodies
more
rarefied
and
more
vigorous
than
those
we
have
at
our
command
and
such
miracles
are
only
so
by
comparison
and
in
relation
to
us
just
as
our
works
would
be
considered
miraculous
amongst
animals
if
they
were
capable
of
remarking
upon
them
the
changing
of
water
into
wine
might
be
a
miracle
of
this
kind
but
the
creation
the
incarnation
and
some
other
actions
of
god
exceed
all
the
power
of
creatures
and
are
truly
miracles
or
indeed
mysteries
if
nevertheless
the
changing
of
water
into
wine
at
cana
was
a
miracle
of
the
highest
kind
god
would
have
thereby
changed
the
whole
course
of
the
universe
because
of
the
connexion
of
bodies
or
else
he
would
have
been
bound
to
prevent
this
connexion
miraculously
also
and
cause
the
bodies
not
concerned
in
the
miracle
to
act
as
if
no
miracle
had
happened
after
the
miracle
was
over
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
restore
all
things
in
those
very
bodies
concerned
to
the
state
they
would
have
reached
without
the
miracle
whereafter
all
would
have
returned
to
its
original
course
thus
this
miracle
demanded
more
than
at
first
appears
as
for
physical
evil
in
creatures
to
wit
their
sufferings
bayle
contends
vigorously
against
those
who
endeavour
to
justify
by
means
of
particular
reasons
the
course
of
action
pursued
by
god
in
regard
to
this
here
i
set
aside
the
sufferings
of
animals
and
i
see
that
bayle
insists
chiefly
on
those
of
men
perhaps
because
he
thinks
that
brute
beasts
have
no
feeling
it
is
on
account
of
the
injustice
there
would
be
in
the
sufferings
of
beasts
that
divers
cartesians
wished
to
prove
that
they
are
only
machines
sub
deo
justo
nemo
innocens
miser
it
is
impossible
that
an
innocent
creature
should
be
unhappy
under
such
a
master
as
god
the
principle
is
good
but
i
do
not
think
it
warrants
the
inference
that
beasts
have
no
feeling
because
i
think
that
properly
speaking
perception
is
not
sufficient
to
cause
misery
if
it
is
not
accompanied
by
reflexion
it
is
the
same
with
happiness
without
reflexion
there
is
none
fortunatos
nimium
sua
qui
bona
norint
one
can
not
reasonably
doubt
the
existence
of
pain
among
animals
but
it
seems
as
if
their
pleasures
and
their
pains
are
not
so
keen
as
they
are
in
man
for
animals
since
they
do
not
reflect
are
susceptible
neither
to
the
grief
that
accompanies
pain
nor
to
the
joy
that
accompanies
pleasure
men
are
sometimes
in
a
state
approaching
that
of
the
beasts
when
they
act
almost
on
instinct
alone
and
simply
on
the
impressions
made
by
the
experience
of
the
senses
and
in
this
state
their
pleasures
and
their
pains
are
very
slight
but
let
us
pass
from
the
beasts
and
return
to
rational
creatures
it
is
with
regard
to
them
that
bayle
discusses
this
question
whether
there
is
more
physical
evil
than
physical
good
in
the
world
to
the
questions
of
a
vol
ii
ch
to
settle
it
aright
one
must
explain
wherein
these
goods
and
evils
lie
we
are
agreed
that
physical
evil
is
simply
displeasure
and
under
that
heading
i
include
pain
grief
and
every
other
kind
of
discomfort
but
does
physical
good
lie
solely
in
pleasure
bayle
appears
to
be
of
this
opinion
but
i
consider
that
it
lies
also
in
a
middle
state
such
as
that
of
health
one
is
well
enough
when
one
has
no
ill
it
is
a
degree
of
wisdom
to
have
no
folly
prima
est
in
the
same
way
one
is
worthy
of
praise
when
one
can
not
with
justice
be
blamed
non
culpabor
sat
mihi
laudis
that
being
the
case
all
the
sensations
not
unpleasing
to
us
all
the
exercises
of
our
powers
that
do
not
incommode
us
and
whose
prevention
would
incommode
us
are
physical
goods
even
when
they
cause
us
no
pleasure
for
privation
of
them
is
a
physical
evil
besides
we
only
perceive
the
good
of
health
and
other
like
goods
when
we
are
deprived
of
them
on
those
terms
i
would
dare
to
maintain
that
even
in
this
life
goods
exceed
evils
that
our
comforts
exceed
our
discomforts
and
that
descartes
was
justified
in
writing
vol
i
letter
natural
reason
teaches
us
that
we
have
more
goods
than
evils
in
this
life
it
must
be
added
that
pleasures
enjoyed
too
often
and
to
excess
would
be
a
very
great
evil
there
are
some
which
hippocrates
compared
to
the
falling
sickness
and
scioppius
doubtless
only
made
pretence
of
envying
the
sparrows
in
order
to
be
agreeably
playful
in
a
learned
and
far
from
playful
work
highly
seasoned
foods
are
injurious
to
health
and
impair
the
niceness
of
a
delicate
sense
and
in
general
bodily
pleasures
are
a
kind
of
expenditure
of
the
spirit
though
they
be
made
good
in
some
better
than
in
others
as
proof
however
that
the
evil
exceeds
the
good
is
quoted
the
instance
of
de
la
motte
le
vayer
letter
who
would
not
have
been
willing
to
return
to
the
world
supposing
he
had
had
to
play
the
same
part
as
providence
had
already
assigned
to
him
but
i
have
already
said
that
i
think
one
would
accept
the
proposal
of
him
who
could
the
thread
of
fate
if
a
new
part
were
promised
to
us
even
though
it
should
not
be
better
than
the
first
thus
from
de
la
motte
le
vayer
saying
it
does
not
follow
that
he
would
not
have
wished
for
the
part
he
had
already
played
provided
it
had
been
new
as
bayle
seems
to
take
it
the
pleasures
of
the
mind
are
the
purest
and
of
greatest
service
in
making
joy
endure
cardan
when
already
an
old
man
was
so
content
with
his
state
that
he
protested
solemnly
that
he
would
not
exchange
it
for
the
state
of
the
richest
of
young
men
who
at
the
same
time
was
ignorant
de

quotes
the
saying
himself
without
criticizing
it
knowledge
has
doubtless
charms
which
can
not
be
conceived
by
those
who
have
not
tasted
them
i
do
not
mean
a
mere
knowledge
of
facts
without
that
of
reasons
but
knowledge
like
that
of
cardan
who
with
all
his
faults
was
a
great
man
and
would
have
been
incomparable
without
those
faults
qui

it
is
no
small
thing
to
be
content
with
god
and
with
the
universe
not
to
fear
what
destiny
has
in
store
for
us
nor
to
complain
of
what
befalls
us
acquaintance
with
true
principles
gives
us
this
advantage
quite
other
than
that
the
stoics
and
the
epicureans
derived
from
their
philosophy
there
is
as
much
difference
between
true
morality
and
theirs
as
there
is
between
joy
and
patience
for
their
tranquillity
was
founded
only
on
necessity
while
ours
must
rest
upon
the
perfection
and
beauty
of
things
upon
our
own
happiness
what
then
shall
we
say
of
bodily
sufferings
may
they
not
be
sufficiently
acute
to
disturb
the
sage
tranquillity
aristotle
assents
the
stoics
were
of
a
different
opinion
and
even
the
epicureans
likewise
descartes
revived
the
doctrine
of
these
philosophers
he
says
in
the
letter
just
quoted
even
amid
the
worst
misfortunes
and
the
most
overwhelming
sufferings
one
may
always
be
content
if
only
one
knows
how
to
exercise
reason
bayle
says
concerning
this
to
the
questions
of
a
vol
iii
ch
it
is
saying
nothing
that
it
is
prescribing
for
us
a
remedy
whose
preparation
hardly
anyone
understands
i
hold
that
the
thing
is
not
impossible
and
that
men
could
attain
it
by
dint
of
meditation
and
practice
for
apart
from
the
true
martyrs
and
those
who
have
been
aided
in
wonderful
wise
from
on
high
there
have
been
counterfeits
who
imitated
them
that
spanish
slave
who
killed
the
carthaginian

order
to
avenge
his
master
and
who
evinced
great
joy
in
his
deed
even
in
the
greatest
tortures
may
shame
the
philosophers
why
should
not
one
go
as
far
as
he
one
may
say
of
an
advantage
as
of
a
disadvantage
potest

but
even
entire
tribes
such
as
the
hurons
the
iroquois
the
galibis
and
other
peoples
of
america
teach
us
a
great
lesson
on
this
matter
one
can
not
read
without
astonishment
of
the
intrepidity
and
insensibility
wherewith
they
brave
their
enemies
who
roast
them
over

if
such
people
could
retain
their

and
combine
them
with
our
acquirements
they
would
surpass
us
in
every
way
ut

they
would
be
in

with

as
a

in

who
persist
obstinately
in
the
strangest
point
of
honour
might
be
acquired
in
our
case
by
training
by
mortifications
by
an
overmastering
joy
founded
on

by
great
practice
in
preserving
a
certain
presence
of
mind
in
the
midst
of
the
distractions
and
impressions
most
liable
to
disturb
it
something
of
this
kind
is
related
of
the
ancient
assassins
subjects
and
pupils
of
the
old
man
or
rather
the
seigneur
of
the
mountain
such
a
school
for
a
better
purpose
would
be
good
for
missionaries
who
would
wish
to
return
to
japan
the
gymnosophists
of
the
ancient
indians
had
perhaps
something
resembling
this
and
that
calanus
who
provided
for
alexander
the
great
the
spectacle
of
his
burning
alive
had
doubtless
been
encouraged
by
the
great
examples
of
his
masters
and
trained
by
great
sufferings
not
to
fear
pain
the
wives
of
these
same
indians
who
even
ask
to
be
burned
with
the
bodies
of
their
husbands
seem
still
to
keep
something
of
the
courage
of
those
ancient
philosophers
of
their
country
i
do
not
expect
that
there
should
straightway
be
founded
a
religious
order
whose
purpose
would
be
to
exalt
man
to
that
high
pitch
of
perfection
such
people
would
be
too
much
above
the
rest
and
too
formidable
for
the
authorities
as
it
rarely
happens
that
people
are
exposed
to
extremes
where
such
great
strength
of
mind
would
be
needed
one
will
scarce
think
of
providing
for
it
at
the
expense
of
our
usual
comforts
albeit
incomparably
more
would
be
gained
than
lost
thereby
nevertheless
the
very
fact
that
one
has
no
need
of
that
great
remedy
is
a
proof
that
the
good
already
exceeds
the
evil
euripides
also
said
greek
pleiô
ta
chrêsta
tôn
kakôn
einai
brotois
nostra
longe
judico
vinci
a
homer
and
divers
other
poets
were
of
another
mind
and
men
in
general
agree
with
them
the
reason
for
this
is
that
the
evil
arouses
our
attention
rather
than
the
good
but
this
same
reason
proves
that
the
evil
is
more
rare
one
must
therefore
not
credit
the
petulant
expressions
of
pliny
who
would
have
it
that
nature
is
a
stepmother
and
who
maintains
that
man
is
the
most
unhappy
and
most
vain
of
all
creatures
these
two
epithets
do
not
agree
one
is
not
so
very
unhappy
when
one
is
full
of
oneself
it
is
true
that
men
hold
human
nature
only
too
much
in
contempt
apparently
because
they
see
no
other
creatures
capable
of
arousing
their
emulation
but
they
have
all
too
much
and
individually
are
but
too
easily
satisfied
i
therefore
agree
with
meric
casaubon
who
in
his
notes
on
the
xenophanes
of
diogenes
laertius
praises
exceedingly
the
admirable
sentiments
of
euripides
going
so
far
as
to
credit
him
with
having
said
things
greek
theopneuston
seneca
lib
speaks
eloquently
of
the
blessings
nature
has
heaped
upon
us
bayle
in
his
article
brings
up
sundry
authorities
against
this
and
among
others
that
of
the
poet
diphilus
in
the
collections
of
stobaeus
whose
greek
might
be
thus
expressed
in
latin
cyathis
bibere
nos
datis
jubens
uno
terna
pro
bono
bayle
believes
that
if
it
were
a
question
only
of
the
evil
of
guilt
or
of
moral
evil
among
men
the
case
would
soon
be
terminated
to
the
advantage
of
pliny
and
euripides
would
lose
his
action
to
that
i
am
not
opposed
our
vices
doubtless
exceed
our
virtues
and
this
is
the
effect
of
original
sin
it
is
nevertheless
true
that
also
on
that
point
men
in
general
exaggerate
things
and
that
even
some
theologians
disparage
man
so
much
that
they
wrong
the
providence
of
the
author
of
mankind
that
is
why
i
am
not
in
favour
of
those
who
thought
to
do
great
honour
to
our
religion
by
saying
that
the
virtues
of
the
pagans
were
only
splendid
vices
it
is
a
sally
of
augustine
which
has
no
foundation
in
holy
scripture
and
which
offends
reason
but
here
we
are
only
discussing
a
physical
good
and
evil
and
one
must
compare
in
detail
the
prosperities
and
the
adversities
of
this
life
bayle
would
wish
almost
to
set
aside
the
consideration
of
health
he
likens
it
to
the
rarefied
bodies
which
are
scarcely
felt
like
air
for
example
but
he
likens
pain
to
the
bodies
that
have
much
density
and
much
weight
in
slight
volume
but
pain
itself
makes
us
aware
of
the
importance
of
health
when
we
are
bereft
of
it
i
have
already
observed
that
excess
of
physical
pleasures
would
be
a
real
evil
and
the
matter
ought
not
to
be
otherwise
it
is
too
important
for
the
spirit
to
be
free
lactantius
lib
cap
had
said
that
men
are
so
squeamish
that
they
complain
of
the
slightest
ill
as
if
it
swallowed
up
all
the
goods
they
have
enjoyed
bayle
says
concerning
this
that
the
very
fact
that
men
have
this
feeling
warrants
the
judgement
that
they
are
in
evil
case
since
it
is
feeling
which
measures
the
extent
of
good
or
evil
but
i
answer
that
present
feeling
is
anything
rather
than
the
true
measure
of
good
and
evil
past
and
future
i
grant
that
one
is
in
evil
case
while
one
makes
these
peevish
reflexions
but
that
does
not
exclude
a
previous
state
of
nor
imply
that
everything
reckoned
in
and
all
allowance
made
the
good
does
not
exceed
the
evil
i
do
not
wonder
that
the
pagans
dissatisfied
with
their
gods
made
complaints
against
prometheus
and
epimetheus
for
having
forged
so
weak
an
animal
as
man
nor
do
i
wonder
that
they
acclaimed
the
fable
of
old
silenus
of
bacchus
who
was
seized
by
king
midas
and
as
the
price
of
his
deliverance
taught
him
that
ostensibly
fine
maxim
that
the
first
and
the
greatest
of
goods
was
not
to
be
born
and
the
second
to
depart
from
this
life
with
dispatch
lib
plato
believed
that
souls
had
been
in
a
happier
state
and
many
of
the
ancients
amongst
others
cicero
in
his
consolation
according
to
the
account
of
lactantius
believed
that
for
their
sins
they
were
confined
in
bodies
as
in
a
prison
they
rendered
thus
a
reason
for
our
ills
and
asserted
their
prejudices
against
human
life
for
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
beautiful
prison
but
quite
apart
from
the
consideration
that
even
according
to
these
same
pagans
the
evils
of
this
life
would
be
counterbalanced
and
exceeded
by
the
goods
of
past
and
future
lives
i
make
bold
to
say
that
we
shall
find
upon
unbiassed
scrutiny
of
the
facts
that
taking
all
in
all
human
life
is
in
general
tolerable
and
adding
thereto
the
motives
of
religion
we
shall
be
content
with
the
order
god
has
set
therein
moreover
for
a
better
judgement
of
our
goods
and
our
evils
it
will
be
well
to
read
cardan

novarini
occultis

bayle
dilates
upon
the
misfortunes
of
the
great
who
are
thought
to
be
the
most
fortunate
the
constant
experience
of
the
fair
aspect
of
their
condition
renders
them
unaware
of
good
but
greatly
aware
of
evil
someone
will
say
so
much
the
worse
for
them
if
they
know
not
how
to
enjoy
the
advantages
of
nature
and
fortune
is
that
the
fault
of
either
there
are
nevertheless
great
men
possessed
of
more
wisdom
who
know
how
to
profit
by
the
favours

has
shown
them
who
are
easily
consoled
for
their
misfortunes
and
who
even
turn
their
own

to

bayle
pays
no
heed
to
that
he
prefers
to
listen
to
pliny
who
thinks
that
augustus
one
of
the
princes
most
favoured
by
fortune
experienced
at
least
as
much
evil
as
good
i
admit
that
he
found
great
causes
of
trouble
in
his
family
and
that
remorse
for
having
crushed
the
republic
may
have
tormented
him
but
i
think
that
he
was
too
wise
to
grieve
over
the
former
and
that
maecenas
apparently
made
him
understand
that
rome
had
need
of
a
master
had
not
augustus
been
converted
on
this
point
vergil

were
alluded
to
in
these
lines
which
speak
of
a
master
given
to
a
free
state
but
there
is
every
indication
that
he
applied
it
just
as
little
to
his
dominion
which
he
regarded
as
compatible
with
liberty
and
as
a
necessary
remedy
for
public
evils
as
the

to
themselves

an
unbiassed

justifies

in
two
words
at
the
beginning
of

but
augustus
was
better
able
than
anyone
to
judge
of
his
good
fortune
he
appears
to
have
died
content
as
may
be
inferred
from
a
proof
he
gave
of
contentedness
with
his
life
for
in
dying
he
repeated
to
his
friends
a
line
in
greek
which
has
the
signification
of
that
that
was
wont
to
be
spoken
at
the
conclusion
of
a
play
suetonius
quotes
it
greek
dote
kroton
kai
pantes
hymeis
meta
charas
ktypêsate
but
even
though
there
should
have
fallen
to
the
lot
of
the
human
kind
more
evil
than
good
it
is
enough
where
god
is
concerned
that
there
is
incomparably
more
good
than
evil
in
the
universe
rabbi
maimonides
whose
merit
is
not
sufficiently
recognized
in
the
statement
that
he
is
the
first
of
the
rabbis
to
have
ceased
talking
nonsense
also
gave
wise
judgement
on
this
question
of
the
predominance
of
good
over
evil
in
the
world
here
is
what
he
says
in
his
cap
arise
often
in
the
hearts
of
persons
thoughts
which
persuade
them
there
is
more
evil
than
good
in
the
world
and
one
often
finds
in
the
poems
and
songs
of
the
pagans
that
it
is
as
it
were
a
miracle
when
something
good
comes
to
pass
whereas
evils
are
usual
and
constant
this
error
has
taken
hold
not
of
the
common
herd
only
those
very
persons
who
wish
to
be
considered
wise
have
been
beguiled
thereby
a
celebrated
writer
named
alrasi
in
his
or
theosophy
amongst
other
absurdities
has
stated
that
there
are
more
evils
than
goods
and
that
upon
comparison
of
the
recreations
and
the
pleasures
man
enjoys
in
times
of
tranquillity
with
the
pains
the
torments
the
troubles
faults
cares
griefs
and
afflictions
whereby
he
is
overwhelmed
our
life
would
prove
to
be
a
great
evil
and
an
actual
penalty
inflicted
upon
us
to
punish
us
maimonides
adds
that
the
cause
of
their
extravagant
error
is
their
supposition
that
nature
was
made
for
them
only
and
that
they
hold
of
no
account
what
is
separate
from
their
person
whence
they
infer
that
when
something
unpleasing
to
them
occurs
all
goes
ill
in
the
universe
bayle
says
that
this
observation
of
maimonides
is
not
to
the
point
because
the
question
is
whether
among
men
evil
exceeds
good
but
upon
consideration
of
the
rabbi
words
i
find
that
the
question
he
formulates
is
general
and
that
he
wished
to
refute
those
who
decide
it
on
one
particular
motive
derived
from
the
evils
of
the
human
race
as
if
all
had
been
made
for
man
and
it
seems
as
though
the
author
whom
he
refutes
spoke
also
of
good
and
evil
in
general
maimonides
is
right
in
saying
that
if
one
took
into
account
the
littleness
of
man
in
relation
to
the
universe
one
would
comprehend
clearly
that
the
predominance
of
evil
even
though
it
prevailed
among
men
need
not
on
that
account
occur
among
the
angels
nor
among
the
heavenly
bodies
nor
among
the
elements
and
inanimate
compounds
nor
among
many
kinds
of
animals
i
have
shown
elsewhere
that
in
supposing
that
the
number
of
the
damned
exceeds
that
of
the
saved
a
supposition
which
is
nevertheless
not
altogether
certain
one
might
admit
that
there
is
more
evil
than
good
in
respect
of
the
human
kind
known
to
us
but
i
pointed
out
that
that
neither
precludes
the
existence
of
incomparably
more
good
than
evil
both
moral
and
physical
in
rational
creatures
in
general
nor
prevents
the
city
of
god
which
contains
all
creatures
from
being
the
most
perfect
state
so
also
on
consideration
of
the
metaphysical
good
and
evil
which
is
in
all
substances
whether
endowed
with
or
devoid
of
intelligence
and
which
taken
in
such
scope
would
include
physical
good
and
moral
good
one
must
say
that
the
universe
such
as
it
actually
is
must
be
the
best
of
all
systems
moreover
bayle
will
not
have
it
that
our
transgression
should
have
anything
to
do
with
the
consideration
of
our
sufferings
he
is
right
when
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
appraising
these
sufferings
but
the
case
is
not
the
same
when
one
asks
whether
they
should
be
ascribed
to
god
this
indeed
being
the
principal
cause
of
bayle
difficulties
when
he
places
reason
or
experience
in
opposition
to
religion
i
know
that
he
is
wont
to
say
that
it
is
of
no
avail
to
resort
to
our
free
will
since
his
objections
tend
also
to
prove
that
the
misuse
of
free
will
must
no
less
be
laid
to
the
account
of
god
who
has
permitted
it
and
who
has
therein
he
states
it
as
a
maxim
that
for
one
difficulty
more
or
less
one
must
not
abandon
a
system
this
he
advances
especially
in
favour
of
the
methods
of
the
strict
and
the
dogma
of
the
supralapsarians
for
he
supposes
that
one
can
subscribe
to
their
opinion
although
he
leaves
all
the
difficulties
in
their
entirety
because
the
other
systems
albeit
they
put
an
end
to
some
of
the
difficulties
can
not
meet
them
all
i
hold
that
the
true
system
i
have
expounded
satisfies
all
nevertheless
even
were
that
not
so
i
confess
that
i
can
not
relish
this
maxim
of
bayle
and
i
should
prefer
a
system
which
would
remove
a
great
portion
of
the
difficulties
to
one
which
would
meet
none
of
them
and
the
consideration
of
the
wickedness
of
men
which
brings
upon
them
all
their
misfortunes
shows
at
least
that
they
have
no
right
to
complain
no
justice
need
trouble
itself
over
the
origin
of
a
scoundrel
wickedness
when
it
is
only
a
question
of
punishing
him
it
is
quite
another
matter
when
it
is
a
question
of
prevention
one
knows
well
that
disposition
upbringing
conversation
and
often
chance
itself
have
much
share
in
that
origin
is
the
man
any
the
less
deserving
of
punishment
i
confess
that
there
still
remains
another
difficulty
if
god
is
not
bound
to
account
to
the
wicked
for
their
wickedness
it
seems
as
if
he
owes
to
himself
and
to
those
who
honour
him
and
love
him
justification
for
his
course
of
action
with
regard
to
the
permission
of
vice
and
crime
but
god
has
already
given
that
satisfaction
as
far
as
it
is
needed
here
on
earth
by
granting
us
the
light
of
reason
he
has
bestowed
upon
us
the
means
whereby
we
may
meet
all
difficulties
i
hope
that
i
have
made
it
plain
in
this
discourse
and
have
elucidated
the
matter
in
the
preceding
portion
of
these
essays
almost
as
far
as
it
can
be
done
through
general
arguments
thereafter
the
permission
of
sin
being
justified
the
other
evils
that
are
a
consequence
thereof
present
no
further
difficulty
thus
also
i
am
justified
in
restricting
myself
here
to
the
evil
of
guilt
to
account
for
the
evil
of
punishment
as
holy
scripture
does
and
likewise
all
the
fathers
of
the
church
and
the
preachers
and
to
the
end
that
none
may
say
that
is
only
good
la
it
is
enough
to
consider
that
after
the
solutions
i
have
given
nothing
must
seem
more
right
or
more
exact
than
this
method
for
god
having
found
already
among
things
possible
before
his
actual
decrees
man
misusing
his
freedom
and
bringing
upon
himself
his
misfortune
yet
could
not
avoid
admitting
him
into
existence
because
the
general
plan
required
this
wherefore
it
will
no
longer
be
necessary
to
say
with
jurieu
that
one
must
dogmatize
like
augustine
and
preach
like
pelagius
this
method
deriving
the
evil
of
punishment
from
the
evil
of
guilt
can
not
be
open
to
censure
and
serves
especially
to
account
for
the
greatest
physical
evil
which
is
damnation
ernst
sonner
sometime
professor
of
philosophy
at
altorf
a
university
established
in
the
territory
of
the
free
city
of
nuremberg
who
was
considered
an
excellent
aristotelian
but
was
finally
recognized
as
being
secretly
a
socinian
had
composed
a
little
discourse
entitled
against
the
eternity
of
it
was
founded
on
this
somewhat
trite
principle
that
there
is
no
proportion
between
an
infinite
punishment
and
a
finite
guilt
it
was
conveyed
to
me
printed
so
it
seemed
in
holland
and
i
replied
that
there
was
one
thing
to
be
considered
which
had
escaped
the
late
herr
sonner
namely
that
it
was
enough
to
say
that
the
duration
of
the
guilt
caused
the
duration
of
the
penalty
since
the
damned
remained
wicked
they
could
not
be
withdrawn
from
their
misery
and
thus
one
need
not
in
order
to
justify
the
continuation
of
their
sufferings
assume
that
sin
has
become
of
infinite
weight
through
the
infinite
nature
of
the
object
offended
who
is
god
this
thesis
i
had
not
explored
enough
to
pass
judgement
thereon
i
know
that
the
general
opinion
of
the
schoolmen
according
to
the
master
of
the
sentences
is
that
in
the
other
life
there
is
neither
merit
nor
demerit
but
i
do
not
think
that
taken
literally
it
can
pass
for
an
article
of
faith
herr

him
death
has
closed
the
door
of

but
not
that
of

i
have
observed
that
sundry
able
theologians
have
accounted
for
the
duration
of
the
pains
of
the
damned
as
i
have
just
done
johann

a
famous
theologian
of

confession
in

that

have
still
an
evil
will

the

could
render
it
good
zacharias
ursinus
a
theologian
of
heidelberg
who
follows
calvin
having
formulated
this
question
in
his
treatise
why
sin
merits
an
eternal
punishment
advances
first
the
common
reason
that
the
person
offended
is
infinite
and
then
also
this
second
reason

peccato
non

cessare

he
indicates
thereby
that
this
opinion
is
very
common
among
learned
men
in
the
roman
church
he
alleges
it
is
true
another
more
subtle
reason
derived
from
pope
gregory
the
great
lib
dial
that
the
damned
are
punished
eternally
because
god
foresaw
by
a
kind
of
that
they
would
always
have
sinned
if
they
had
always
lived
upon

but
it
is
a
hypothesis
very
much
open
to
question

the

must
remain
eternally
deprived
of

that
this
deprivation
might
well
be
the
origin
and
the
cause
of
all
their
pains
through
the
reflexions
these
unhappy
creatures
make
upon
their
crimes
which
have
deprived
them
of
an
eternal
bliss
one
knows
what
burning
regrets
what
pain
envy
causes
to
those
who
see
themselves
deprived
of
a
good
of
a
notable
honour
which
had
been
offered
to
them
and
which
they
rejected
especially
when
they
see
others
invested
with
it
this
position
is
a
little
different
from
that
of
jurieu
but
both
agree
in
this
sentiment
that
the
damned
are
themselves
the
cause
of
the
continuation
of
their
torments
le
clerc
origenist
does
not
entirely
differ
from
this
opinion
when
he
says
in
the
vol
who
foresaw
that
man
would
fall
does
not
condemn
him
on
that
account
but
only
because
although
he
has
the
power
to
recover
himself
he
yet
does
not
do
so
that
is
he
freely
retains
his
evil
ways
to
the
end
of
his
life
if
he
carries
this
reasoning
on
beyond
this
life
he
will
ascribe
the
continuation
of
the
pains
of
the
wicked
to
the
continuation
of
their
guilt
bayle
says
to
the
questions
of
a
ch
this
dogma
of
the
origenist
is
heretical
in
that
it
teaches
that
damnation
is
not
founded
simply
on
sin
but
on
voluntary
impenitence
but
is
not
this
voluntary
impenitence
a
continuation
of
sin
i
would
not
simply
say
however
that
it
is
because
man
having
the
power
to
recover
himself
does
not
and
would
wish
to
add
that
it
is
because
man
does
not
take
advantage
of
the
succour
of
grace
to
aid
him
to
recover
himself
but
after
this
life
though
one
assume
that
the
succour
ceases
there
is
always
in
the
man
who
sins
even
when
he
is
damned
a
freedom
which
renders
him
culpable
and
a
power
albeit
remote
of
recovering
himself
even
though
it
should
never
pass
into
action
and
there
is
no
reason
why
one
may
not
say
that
this
degree
of
freedom
exempt
from
necessity
but
not
exempt
from
certainty
remains
in
the
damned
as
well
as
in
the
blessed
moreover
the
damned
have
no
need
of
a
succour
that
is
needed
in
this
life
for
they
know
only
too
well
what
one
must
believe
here
the
illustrious
prelate
of
the
anglican
church
who
published
recently
a
book
on
the
origin
of
evil
concerning
which
bayle
made
some
observations
in
the
second
volume
of
his
speaks
with
much
subtlety
about
the
pains
of
the
damned
this
prelate
opinion
is
presented
according
to
the
author
of
the
de
la
république
des
june
as
if
he
made
the
damned
just
so
many
madmen
who
will
feel
their
miseries
acutely
but
who
will
nevertheless
congratulate
themselves
on
their
own
behaviour
and
who
will
rather
choose
to
be
and
to
be
that
which
they
are
than
not
to
be
at
all
they
will
love
their
state
unhappy
as
it
will
be
even
as
angry
people
lovers
the
ambitious
the
envious
take
pleasure
in
the
very
things
that
only
augment
their
misery
furthermore
the
ungodly
will
have
so
accustomed
their
mind
to
wrong
judgements
that
they
will
henceforth
never
make
any
other
kind
and
will
perpetually
pass
from
one
error
into
another
they
will
not
be
able
to
refrain
from
desiring
perpetually
things
whose
enjoyment
will
be
denied
them
and
being
deprived
of
which
they
will
fall
into
inconceivable
despair
while
experience
can
never
make
them
wiser
for
the
future
for
by
their
own
fault
they
will
have
altogether
corrupted
their
understanding
and
will
have
rendered
it
incapable
of
passing
a
sound
judgement
on
any
matter
the
ancients
already
imagined
that
the
devil
dwells
remote
from
god
voluntarily
in
the
midst
of
his
torments
and
that
he
is
unwilling
to
redeem
himself
by
an
act
of
submission
they
invented
a
tale
that
an
anchorite
in
a
vision
received
a
promise
from
god
that
he
would
receive
into
grace
the
prince
of
the
bad
angels
if
he
would
acknowledge
his
fault
but
that
the
devil
rebuffed
this
mediator
in
a
strange
manner
at
the
least
the
theologians
usually
agree
that
the
devils
and
the
damned
hate
god
and
blaspheme
him
and
such
a
state
can
not
but
be
followed
by
continuation
of
misery
concerning
that
one
may
read
the
learned
treatise
of
herr
fecht
on
the
of
the
there
were
times
when
the
belief
was
held
that
it
was
not
impossible
for
a
lost
soul
to
be
delivered
the
story
told
of
pope
gregory
the
great
is
well
known
how
by
his
prayers
he
had
withdrawn
from
hell
the
soul
of
the
emperor
trajan
whose
goodness
was
so
renowned
that
to
new
emperors
the
wish
was
offered
that
they
should
surpass
augustus
in
good
fortune
and
trajan
in
goodness
it
was
this
that
won
for
the
latter
the
pity
of
the
holy
father
god
acceded
to
his
prayers
it
is
said
but
he
forbade
him
to
make
the
like
prayers
in
future
according
to
this
fable
the
prayers
of
gregory
had
the
force
of
the
remedies
of
aesculapius
who
recalled
hippolytus
from
hades
and
if
he
had
continued
to
make
such
prayers
god
would
have
waxed
wroth

a
monk
of
the
ninth
century
who
set
at
variance
the
theologians
of
his
day
and
even
those
of
our
day
maintained
that
the
reprobate
should
pray
god
to
render
their
pains
more
bearable
but
one
is
never
justified
in
believing
oneself
reprobate
so
long
as

is
alive
the
passage
in

for
the
dead
is
more
reasonable
it
asks
for
the
abatement
of
the
torments
of
the
damned
and
according
to
the
hypothesis
that
i
have
just
stated
one
must
wish
for

applied

passage
from
psalm

will
not
forget
to
be
gracious
neither
will
he
shut

replies
that
it
is
possible
that
the
pains
of
the
damned
last
eternally

that
they
may
nevertheless
be
mitigated
if
the
text
implied
that
the
abatement
would
as
regards
its
duration
go
on
to
infinity
and
yet
that
abatement
would
as
regards
its
extent
have
a
plus
even
so
there
are
asymptote
figures
in
geometry
where
an
infinite
length
makes
only
a
finite
progress
in
breadth
if
the
parable
of
the
wicked
rich
man
represented
the
state
of
a
definitely
lost
soul
the
hypothesis
which
makes
these
souls
so
mad
and
so
wicked
would
be
groundless
but
the
charity
towards
his
brothers
attributed
to
him
in
the
parable
does
not
seem
to
be
consistent
with
that
degree
of
wickedness
which
is
ascribed
to
the
damned
gregory
the
great
ix
thinks
that
the
rich
man
was
afraid
lest
their
damnation
should
increase
his
but
it
seems
as
though
this
fear
is
not
sufficiently
consistent
with
the
disposition
of
a
perfectly
wicked
will
bonaventura
on
the
master
of
the
sentences
says
that
the
wicked
rich
man
would
have
desired
to
see
everyone
damned
but
since
that
was
not
to
be
he
desired
the
salvation
of
his
brothers
rather
than
that
of
the
rest
this
reply
is
by
no
means
sound
on
the
contrary
the
mission
of
lazarus
that
he
desired
would
have
served
to
save
many
people
and
he
who
takes
so
much
pleasure
in
the
damnation
of
others
that
he
desires
it
for
everyone
will
perhaps
desire
that
damnation
for
some
more
than
others
but
generally
speaking
he
will
have
no
inclination
to
gain
salvation
for
anyone
however
that
may
be
one
must
admit
that
all
this
detail
is
problematical
god
having
revealed
to
us
all
that
is
needed
to
put
us
in
fear
of
the
greatest
of
misfortunes
and
not
what
is
needed
for
our
understanding
thereof
now
since
it
is
henceforth
permitted
to
have
recourse
to
the
misuse
of
free
will
and
to
evil
will
in
order
to
account
for
other
evils
since
the
divine
permission
of
this
misuse
is
plainly
enough
justified

ordinary
system
of
the
theologians

with

the

can
seek
with
confidence
origin

of

is
well
known
to
us
it
is
that
of
the
devil
and
his
angels
the
devil
sinneth
from
the
beginning
and
for
this
purpose
the
son
of
god
was
manifested
that
he
might
destroy
the
works
of
the
devil
john

the
devil
is
the
father
of
wickedness
he
was
a
murderer
from
the
beginning
and
abode
not
in
the
truth
john
viii
and
therefore
god
spared
not
the
angels
that
sinned
but
cast
them
down
to
hell
and
delivered
them
into
chains
of
darkness
to
be
reserved

the
judgement
of

it
is
easy
to
observe
that
one
of

two
letters
must
have
been
seen
by
the
author
of

other
it
seems
as
if
the
author
of
the
apocalypse
wished
to
throw
light
upon
what
the
other
canonical
writers
had
left
obscure
he
gives
us
an
account
of

battle
that
took

in
heaven
michael
and
his
angels
fought
against
the
dragon
and
the
dragon
fought
and

prevailed
not
neither
was
their
place
found
any
more

great
dragon
was
cast
out

old
serpent
called
the
devil
and
satan
which
deceiveth
the
whole
world
and
he
was
cast
out
into

his
angels
were
cast

him

is

indicate
thereby
some
revulsion

that
can

is
penetrated

are

taken
up
as

that

corruption
is
not
altogether
invincible
and
as
we
do
not
necessarily
sin
even
when
we
are
under
the
bondage
of
sin
it
must
likewise
be
said
that
we
are
not
aided
invincibly
and
however
efficacious
divine
grace
may
be
there
is
justification
for
saying
that
one
can
resist
it
but
when
it
indeed
proves
victorious
it
is
certain
and
infallible
beforehand
that
one
will
yield
to
its
allurements
whether
it
have
its
strength
of
itself
or
whether
it
find
a
way
to
triumph
through
the
congruity
of
circumstances

one
must
always
distinguish
between
the
infallible
and
the
necessary
the
system
of
those
who
call
themselves

is
not
far
removed
from
this
provided

obnoxious
things

in
the
dogmas
themselves
in
the
i
find
that
it
is
principally
the
use
of
terms
like
or
or
which
sometimes
gives
a
handle
and
causes
much
ado
that
is
why
as
herr
löscher
the
younger
aptly
observed
in
a
learned
dissertation
on
the
of
the
absolute
luther
desired
in
his
book
the
will
in
to
find
a
word
more
fitting
for
that
which
he
wished
to
express
than
the
word
necessity
speaking
generally
it
appears
more
reasonable
and
more
fitting
to
say
that
obedience
to
god
precepts
is
always
even
for
the
unregenerate
that
the
grace
of
god
is
always
even
in
those
most
holy
and
that
is
exempt
not
only
from
but
also
from
although
it
be
never
without
infallible
or
without
inclining
nevertheless
there
is
on
the
other
hand
a
sense
wherein
it
would
be
permitted
to
say
in
certain
conjunctures
that
the
to
do
good
is
often
lacking
even
in
the
just
that
sins
are
often
even
in
the
regenerate
that
it
is
sometimes
for
one
not
to
sin
that
grace
is
that
freedom
is
not
exempt
from
but
these
expressions
are
less
exact
and
less
pleasing
in
the
circumstances
that
prevail
about
us
they
are
also
in
general
more
open
to
misuse
and
moreover
they
savour
somewhat
of
the
speech
of
the
people
where
terms
are
employed
with
great
latitude
there
are
however
circumstances
which
render
them
acceptable
and
even
serviceable
it
is
the
case
that
sacred
and
orthodox
writers
and
even
the
holy
scriptures
have
made
use
of
expressions
on
both
sides
and
no
real
contradiction
has
arisen
any
more
than
between
paul
and
james
or
any
error
on
either
side
that
might
be
attributable
to
the
ambiguity
of
the
terms
one
is
so
well
accustomed
to
these
various
ways
of
speaking
that
often
one
is
put
to
it
to
say
precisely
which
sense
is
the
more
ordinary
and
the
more
natural
and
even
that
more
intended
by
the
author
sensus
magis
naturalis
obvius
for
the
same
writer
has
different
aims
in
different
passages
and
the
same
ways
of
speaking
are
more
or
less
accepted
or
acceptable
before
or
after
the
decision
of
some
great
man
or
of
some
authority
that
one
respects
and
follows
as
a
result
of
this
one
may
well
authorize
or
ban
as
opportunity
arises
and
at
certain
times
certain
expressions
but
it
makes
no
difference
to
the
sense
or
to
the
content
of
faith
if
sufficient
explanations
of
the
terms
are
not
added
it
is
therefore
only
necessary
to
understand
fully
some
distinctions
such
as
that
i
have
very
often
urged
between
the
necessary
and
the
certain
and
between
metaphysical
necessity
and
moral
necessity
it
is
the
same
with
possibility
and
impossibility
since
the
event
whose
opposite
is
possible
is
contingent
even
as
that
whose
opposite
is
impossible
is
necessary
a
distinction
is
rightly
drawn
also
between
a
proximate
potency
and
a
remote
potency
and
according
to
these
different
senses
one
says
now
that
a
thing
may
be
and
now
that
it
may
not
be
it
may
be
said
in
a
certain
sense
that
it
is
necessary
that
the
blessed
should
not
sin
that
the
devils
and
the
damned
should
sin
that
god
himself
should
choose
the
best
that
man
should
follow
the
course
which
after
all
attracts
him
most
but
this
necessity
is
not
opposed
to
contingency
it
is
not
of
the
kind
called
logical
geometrical
or
metaphysical
whose
opposite
implies
contradiction
nicole
has
made
use
somewhere
of
a
comparison
which
is
not
amiss
it
is
considered
impossible
that
a
wise
and
serious
magistrate
who
has
not
taken
leave
of
his
senses
should
publicly
commit
some
outrageous
action
as
it
would
be
for
instance
to
run
about
the
streets
naked
in
order
to
make
people
laugh
it
is
the
same
in
a
sense
with
the
blessed
they
are
still
less
capable
of
sinning
and
the
necessity
that
forbids
them
to
sin
is
of
the
same
kind
finally
i
also
hold
that
is
a
term
as
equivocal
as
potency
and
necessity
for
i
have
already
observed
that
those
who
employ
this
axiom
that
one
does
not
fail
to
do
what
one
wills
when
one
can
and
who
thence
infer
that
god
therefore
does
not
will
the
salvation
of
all
imply
a
only
in
that
sense
can
one
support
this
proposition
that
wisdom
never
wills
what
it
knows
to
be
among
the
things
that
shall
not
happen
on
the
other
hand
one
may
say
taking
will
in
a
sense
more
general
and
more
in
conformity
with
customary
use
that
the
wise
will
is
antecedently
to
all
good
although
it
finally
to
do
that
which
is
most
fitting
thus
one
would
be
very
wrong
to
deny
to
god
the
serious
and
strong
inclination
to
save
all
men
which
holy
scripture
attributes
to
him
or
even
to
attribute
to
him
an
original
distaste
which
diverts
him
from
the
salvation
of
a
number
of
persons
one
should
rather
maintain
that
the
wise
mind
tends
towards
all
good
as
good
in
proportion
to
his
knowledge
and
his
power
but
that
he
only
produces
the
best
that
can
be
achieved
those
who
admit
that
and
yet
deny
to
god
the
antecedent
will
to
save
all
men
are
wrong
only
in
their
misuse
of
the
term
provided
that
they
acknowledge
besides
that
god
gives
to
all
help
sufficient
to
enable
them
to
win
salvation
if
only
they
have
the
will
to
avail
themselves
thereof
in
the
themselves
held
by
the
disciples
of
augustine
i
can
not
approve
the
damnation
of
unregenerate
children
nor
in
general
damnation
resulting
from
original
sin
alone
nor
can
i
believe
that
god
condemns
those
who
are
without
the
necessary
light
one
may
believe
with
many
theologians
that
men
receive
more
aid
than
we
are
aware
of
were
it
only
when
they
are
at
the
point
of
death
it
does
not
appear
necessary
either
that
all
those
who
are
saved
should
always
be
saved
through
a
grace
efficacious
of
itself
independently
of
circumstances
also
i
consider
it
unnecessary
to
say
that
all
the
virtues
of
the
pagans
were
false
or
that
all
their
actions
were
sins
though
it
be
true
that
what
does
not
spring
from
faith
or
from
the
uprightness
of
the
soul
before
god
is
infected
with
sin
at
least
virtually
finally
i
hold
that
god
can
not
act
as
if
at
random
by
an
absolutely
absolute
decree
or
by
a
will
independent
of
reasonable
motives
and
i
am
persuaded
that
he
is
always
actuated
in
the
dispensation
of
his
grace
by
reasons
wherein
the
nature
of
the
objects
participates
otherwise
he
would
not
act
in
accordance
with
wisdom
i
grant
nevertheless
that
these
reasons
are
not
of
necessity
bound
up
with
the
good
or
the
less
evil
natural
qualities
of
men
as
if
god
gave
his
grace
only
according
to
these
good
qualities
yet
i
hold
as
i
have
explained
already
here
that
these
qualities
are
taken
into
consideration
like
all
the
other
circumstances
since
nothing
can
be
neglected
in
the
designs
of
supreme
wisdom
save
for
these
points
and
some
few
others
where
augustine
appears
obscure
or
even
repellent
it
seems
as
though
one
can
conform
to
his
system
he
states
that
from
the
substance
of
god
only
a
god
can
proceed
and
that
thus
the
creature
is
derived
from
nothingness

it
is
not

of

that

says
that

come

the
knowledge
of
the
truth
which
i
would
not
interpret
in

with
some
passages
of
augustine
as
if
it
signified
that
no
men
are
saved
except
those
whose
salvation
he
wills
or
as
if
he
would
save
singulos

but
i
would
rather
say
that
there
is
none
whose
salvation
he
willeth
not
in
so
far
as
this
is
permitted
by
greater
reasons
for
these
bring
it
about
that
god
only
saves
those
who
accept
the
faith
he
has
offered
to
them
and
who
surrender
themselves
thereto
by
the
grace
he
has
given
them
in
accordance
with
what
was
consistent
with
the
plan
of
his
works
in
its
entirety
than
which
none
can
be
better
conceived
as
for
predestination
to
salvation
it
includes
also
according
to
augustine
the
ordinance
of
the
means
that

lead

he
does
not
then
understand
it
there
as
an
absolute
decree
he
maintains
that
there
is
a
grace
which
is
not
rejected
by
any
hardened
heart
because
it
is
given
in
order
to
remove
especially
the
hardness
of
hearts
de
de
i
do
not
find
however
that
augustine
conveys
sufficiently
that
this
grace
which
subdues
the
heart
is
always
efficacious
of
itself
and
one
might
perhaps
have
asserted
without
offence
to
him
that
the
same
degree
of
inward
grace
is
victorious
in
the
one
where
it
is
aided
by
outward
circumstances
but
not
in
the
other
will
is
proportionate
to
the
sense
we
have
of
the
good
and
follows
the
sense
which
prevails
utrumque
tantundem
diligimus
nihil
horum
dabimus

quod
amplius

delectat

operemur
necesse
in
i
have
explained
already
how
despite
all
that
we
have
indeed
a
great
power
over
our
will
augustine
takes
it
somewhat
differently
and
in
a
way
that
does
not
go
far
when
he
says
that
nothing
is
so
much
within
our
power
as
the
action
of
our
will
and
he
gives
a
reason
which
is
almost
tautological
for
he
says
this
action
is
ready
at
the
moment
when
we
will
tam

that
only
means
that
we
will
when
we
will
and
not
that
we
will
that
which
we
wish
to
will
there
is
more
reason
for
saying
with
him
voluntas
non
est
aut
libera
dicenda
and
that
what
inclines
the
will
towards
good
infallibly
or
certainly
does
not
prevent
it
from
being
free

he
also
says
aptly
that
god
gives
the
first
good
impulse
but
that
afterwards
man
acts
also
ut
agant
non
ut

have
proved
that
free
will
is
the
proximate
cause
of
the
evil
of
guilt
and
consequently
of
the
evil
of
punishment
although
it
is
true
that
the
original
imperfection
of
creatures
which
is
already
presented
in
the
eternal
ideas
is
the
first
and
most
remote
cause
bayle
nevertheless
always
disputes
this
use
of
the
notion
of
free
will
he
will
not
have
the
cause
of
evil
ascribed
to
it
one
must
listen
to
his
objections
but
first
it
will
be
well
to
throw
further
light
on
the
nature
of
freedom
i
have
shown
that
freedom
according
to
the
definition
required
in
the
schools
of
theology
consists
in
intelligence
which
involves
a
clear
knowledge
of
the
object
of
deliberation
in
spontaneity
whereby
we
determine
and
in
contingency
that
is
in
the
exclusion
of
logical
or
metaphysical
necessity
intelligence
is
as
it
were
the
soul
of
freedom
and
the
rest
is
as
its
body
and
foundation
the
free
substance
is
and
that
according
to
the
motive
of
good
perceived
by
the
understanding
which
inclines
it
without
compelling
it
and
all
the
conditions
of
freedom
are
comprised
in
these
few
words
it
is
nevertheless
well
to
point
out
that
the
imperfection
present
in
our
knowledge
and
our
spontaneity
and
the
infallible
determination
that
is
involved
in
our
contingency
destroy
neither
freedom
nor
contingency
our
knowledge
is
of
two
kinds
distinct
or
confused
distinct
knowledge
or
occurs
in
the
actual
use
of
reason
but
the
senses
supply
us
with
confused
thoughts
and
we
may
say
that
we
are
immune
from
bondage
in
so
far
as
we
act
with
a
distinct
knowledge
but
that
we
are
the
slaves
of
passion
in
so
far
as
our
perceptions
are
confused
in
this
sense
we
have
not
all
the
freedom
of
spirit
that
were
to
be
desired
and
we
may
say
with
augustine
that
being
subject
to
sin
we
have
the
freedom
of
a
slave
yet
a
slave
slave
as
he
is
nevertheless
has
freedom
to
choose
according
to
the
state
wherein
he
is
although
more
often
than
not
he
is
under
the
stern
necessity
of
choosing
between
two
evils
because
a
superior
force
prevents
him
from
attaining
the
goods
whereto
he
aspires
that
which
in
a
slave
is
effected
by
bonds
and
constraint
in
us
is
effected
by
passions
whose
violence
is
sweet
but
none
the
less
pernicious
in
truth
we
will
only
that
which
pleases
us
but
unhappily
what
pleases
us
now
is
often
a
real
evil
which
would
displease
us
if
we
had
the
eyes
of
the
understanding
open
nevertheless
that
evil
state
of
the
slave
which
is
also
our
own
does
not
prevent
us
any
more
than
him
from
making
a
free
choice
of
that
which
pleases
us
most
in
the
state
to
which
we
are
reduced
in
proportion
to
our
present
strength
and
knowledge
as
for
spontaneity
it
belongs
to
us
in
so
far
as
we
have
within
us
the
source
of
our
actions
as
aristotle
rightly
conceived
the
impressions
of
external
things
often
indeed
divert
us
from
our
path
and
it
was
commonly
believed
that
at
least
in
this
respect
some
of
the
sources
of
our
actions
were
outside
ourselves
i
admit
that
one
is
bound
to
speak
thus
adapting
oneself
to
the
popular
mode
of
expression
as
one
may
in
a
certain
sense
without
doing
violence
to
truth
but
when
it
is
a
question
of
expressing
oneself
accurately
i
maintain
that
our
spontaneity
suffers
no
exception
and
that
external
things
have
no
physical
influence
upon
us
i
mean
in
the
strictly
philosophical
sense
for
better
understanding
of
this
point
one
must
know
that
true
spontaneity
is
common
to
us
and
all
simple
substances
and
that
in
the
intelligent
or
free
substance
this
becomes
a
mastery
over
its
actions
that
can
not
be
better
explained
than
by
the
system
of
harmony
which
i
indeed
propounded
some
years
ago
there
i
pointed
out
that
by
nature
every
simple
substance
has
perception
and
that
its
individuality
consists
in
the
perpetual
law
which
brings
about
the
sequence
of
perceptions
that
are
assigned
to
it
springing
naturally
from
one
another
to
represent
the
body
that
is
allotted
to
it
and
through
its
instrumentality
the
entire
universe
in
accordance
with
the
point
of
view
proper
to
this
simple
substance
and
without
its
needing
to
receive
any
physical
influence
from
the
body
even
so
the
body
also
for
its
part
adapts
itself
to
the
wishes
of
the
soul
by
its
own
laws
and
consequently
only
obeys
it
according
to
the
promptings
of
these
laws
whence
it
follows
that
the
soul
has
in
itself
a
perfect
spontaneity
so
that
it
depends
only
upon
god
and
upon
itself
in
its
actions
as
this
system
was
not
known
formerly
other
ways
were
sought
for
emerging
from
this
labyrinth
and
the
cartesians
themselves
were
in
difficulties
over
the
subject
of
free
will
they
were
no
longer
satisfied
by
the
of
the
schoolmen
and
they
considered
that
all
the
actions
of
the
soul
appear
to
be
determined
by
what
comes
from
without
according
to
the
impressions
of
the
senses
and
that
ultimately
all
is
controlled
in
the
universe
by
the
providence
of
god
thence
arose
naturally
the
objection
that
there
is
therefore
no
freedom
to
that
descartes
replied
that
we
are
assured
of
god
providence
by
reason
but
that
we
are
likewise
assured
of
our
freedom
by
experience
thereof
within
ourselves
and
that
we
must
believe
in
both
even
though
we
see
not
how
it
is
possible
to
reconcile
them
that
was
cutting
the
gordian
knot
and
answering
the
conclusion
of
an
argument
not
by
refuting
it
but
by
opposing
thereto
a
contrary
argument
which
procedure
does
not
conform
to
the
laws
for
philosophical
disputes
notwithstanding
most
of
the
cartesians
contented
themselves
with
this
albeit
the
inward
experience
they
adduce
does
not
prove
their
assertion
as
bayle
has
clearly
shown
regis
vol
book
part
thus
paraphrases
descartes
doctrine
philosophers
he
says
fallen
into
error
some
not
being
able
to
understand
the
relation
existing
between
free
actions
and
the
providence
of
god
have
denied
that
god
was
the
first
efficient
cause
of
free
will
but
that
is
sacrilegious
the
others
not
being
able
to
apprehend
the
relation
between
god
efficacy
and
free
actions
have
denied
that
man
was
endowed
with
freedom
and
that
is
a
blasphemy
the
mean
to
be
found
between
these
two
extremes
is
to
say
id
even
though
we
were
not
able
to
understand
all
the
relations
existing
between
freedom
and
providence
we
should
nevertheless
be
bound
to
acknowledge
that
we
are
free
and
dependent
upon
god
for
both
these
truths
are
equally
known
the
one
through
experience
and
the
other
through
reason
and
prudence
forbids
one
to
abandon
truths
whereof
one
is
assured
under
the
pretext
that
one
can
not
apprehend
all
the
relations
existing
between
them
and
other
truths
well
known
bayle
here
remarks
pertinently
in
the
margin
these
expressions
of
regis
fail
to
point
out
that
we
are
aware
of
relations
between
man
actions
and
god
providence
such
as
appear
to
us
to
be
incompatible
with
our
freedom
he
adds
that
these
expressions
are
weakening
the
statement
of
the
problem
assume
he
says
the
difficulty
arises
solely
from
our
lack
of
enlightenment
whereas
they
ought
to
say
that
it
arises
in
the
main
from
the
enlightenment
which
we
have
and
can
not
reconcile
in
bayle
opinion
our
mysteries
that
is
exactly
what
i
said
at
the
beginning
of
this
work
that
if
the
mysteries
were
irreconcilable
with
reason
and
if
there
were
unanswerable
objections
far
from
finding
the
mystery
incomprehensible
we
should
comprehend
that
it
was
false
it
is
true
that
here
there
is
no
question
of
a
mystery
but
only
of
natural
religion
this
is
how
bayle
combats
those
inward
experiences
whereon
the
cartesians
make
freedom
rest
but
he
begins
by
reflexions
with
which
i
can
not
agree
who
do
not
make
profound
examination
he
says
art
lit
greek
td
that
which
passes
within
them
easily
persuade
themselves
that
they
are
free
and
that
if
their
will
prompts
them
to
evil
it
is
their
fault
it
is
through
a
choice
whereof
they
are
the
masters
those
who
judge
otherwise
are
persons
who
have
studied
with
care
the
springs
and
the
circumstances
of
their
actions
and
who
have
thought
over
the
progress
of
their
soul
impulses
those
persons
usually
have
doubts
about
their
free
will
and
even
come
to
persuade
themselves
that
their
reason
and
mind
are
slaves
without
power
to
resist
the
force
that
carries
them
along
where
they
would
not
go
it
was
principally
persons
of
this
kind
who
ascribed
to
the
gods
the
cause
of
their
evil
deeds
these
words
remind
me
of
those
of
chancellor
bacon
who
says
that
a
little
philosophy
inclineth
us
away
from
god
but
that
depth
in
philosophy
bringeth
men
minds
about
to
him
it
is
the
same
with
those
who
reflect
upon
their
actions
it
appears
to
them
at
first
that
all
we
do
is
only
impulsion
from
others
and
that
all
we
apprehend
comes
from
without
through
the
senses
and
is
traced
upon
the
void
of
our
mind
in
tabula
but
more
profound
meditation
shows
us
that
all
even
perceptions
and
passions
comes
to
us
from
our
own
inner
being
with
complete
spontaneity
yet
bayle
cites
poets
who
pretend
to
exonerate
men
by
laying
the
blame
upon
the
gods
medea
in
ovid
speaks
thus
medea
repugnas
quid
deus
obstat
and
a
little
later
ovid
makes
her
add
trahit
invitam
nova
vis
aliudque
cupido
aliud
suadet
video
meliora
proboque
but
one
could
set
against
that
a
passage
from
vergil
who
makes
nisus
say
with
far
more
reason
ne
hunc
ardorem
mentibus
addunt
an
sua
cuique
deus
fit
dira
cupido
herr
wittich
seems
to
have
thought
that
in
reality
our
independence
is
only
apparent
for
in
his
de
providentia
dei
he
makes
free
will
consist
in
our
being
inclined
towards
the
objects
that
present
themselves
to
our
soul
for
affirmation
or
denial
love
or
hate
in
such
a
way
that
we
not
we
are
being
determined
by
any
outward
force
he
adds
that
it
is
when
god
himself
causes
our
volitions
that
we
act
with
most
freedom
and
that
the
more
efficacious
and
powerful
god
action
is
upon
us
the
more
we
are
masters
of
our
actions
enim
deus
operatur
ipsum
velle
quo
efficacius
operatur
eo
magis
volumus
quod
autem
cum
volumus
facimus
id
maxime
habemus
in
nostra
potestate
it
is
true
that
when
god
causes
a
volition
in
us
he
causes
a
free
action
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
here
is
not
of
the
universal
cause
or
of
that
production
of
our
will
which
is
proper
to
it
in
so
far
as
it
is
a
created
effect
whose
positive
elements
are
actually
created
continually
through
god
like
all
other
absolute
reality
of
things
we
are
concerned
here
with
the
reasons
for
willing
and
the
means
god
uses
when
he
gives
us
a
good
will
or
permits
us
to
have
an
evil
will
it
is
always
we
who
produce
it
good
or
evil
for
it
is
our
action
but
there
are
always
reasons
that
make
us
act
without
impairing
either
our
spontaneity
or
our
freedom
grace
does
no
more
than
give
impressions
which
are
conducive
to
making
will
operate
through
fitting
motives
such
as
would
be
an
attention
dic
cur
a
prevenient
pleasure
and
it
is
quite
evident
that
that
does
not
interfere
with
freedom
any
more
than
could
a
friend
who
gives
counsel
and
furnishes
motives
thus
herr
wittich
has
not
supplied
an
answer
to
the
question
any
more
than
bayle
and
recourse
to
god
is
of
no
avail
here
but
let
me
give
another
much
more
reasonable
passage
from
the
same
bayle
where
he
disputes
with
greater
force
the
lively
sense
of
freedom
which
according
to
the
cartesians
is
a
proof
of
freedom
his
words
are
indeed
full
of
wit
and
worthy
of
consideration
and
occur
in
the
to
the
questions
of
a
vol
iii
ch
here
they
are
the
clear
and
distinct
sense
we
have
of
our
existence
we
do
not
discern
whether
we
exist
through
ourselves
or
derive
our
being
from
another
we
discern
that
only
by
reflexion
that
is
through
meditation
upon
our
powerlessness
in
the
matter
of
conserving
ourselves
as
much
as
we
would
and
of
freeing
ourselves
from
dependence
upon
the
beings
that
surround
us
etc
it
is
indeed
certain
that
the
pagans
the
same
must
be
said
of
the
socinians
since
they
deny
the
creation
never
attained
to
the
knowledge
of
that
true
dogma
that
we
were
created
from
nothing
and
that
we
are
derived
from
nothingness
at
every
moment
of
our
continuance
they
therefore
thought
erroneously
that
all
substances
in
the
universe
exist
of
themselves
and
can
never
be
reduced
to
nothing
and
that
thus
they
depend
upon
no
other
thing
save
in
respect
of
their
modifications
which
are
liable
to
be
destroyed
by
the
action
of
an
external
cause
does
not
this
error
spring
from
the
fact
that
we
are
unconscious
of
the
creative
action
which
conserves
us
and
that
we
are
only
conscious
of
our
existence
that
we
are
conscious
of
it
i
say
in
such
a
way
that
we
should
for
ever
remain
ignorant
of
the
cause
of
our
being
if
other
knowledge
did
not
aid
us
let
us
say
also
that
the
clear
and
distinct
sense
we
have
of
the
acts
of
our
will
can
not
make
us
discern
whether
we
give
them
ourselves
to
ourselves
or
receive
them
from
that
same
cause
which
gives
us
existence
we
must
have
recourse
to
reflexion
or
to
meditation
in
order
to
effect
this
discrimination
now
i
assert
that
one
can
never
by
purely
philosophical
meditations
arrive
at
an
established
certainty
that
we
are
the
efficient
cause
of
our
volitions
for
every
person
who
makes
due
investigation
will
recognize
clearly
that
if
we
were
only
passive
subjects
with
regard
to
will
we
should
have
the
same
sensations
of
experience
as
we
have
when
we
think
that
we
are
free
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
god
so
ordered
the
laws
of
the
union
between
soul
and
body
that
all
the
modalities
of
the
soul
without
a
single
exception
are
of
necessity
linked
together
with
the
interposition
of
the
modalities
of
the
brain
you
will
then
understand
that
nothing
will
happen
to
us
except
that
of
which
we
are
conscious
there
will
be
in
our
soul
the
same
sequence
of
thoughts
from
the
perception
of
objects
of
the
senses
which
is
its
first
step
up
to
the
most
definite
volitions
which
are
its
final
step
there
will
be
in
this
sequence
the
consciousness
of
ideas
that
of
affirmations
that
of
irresolutions
that
of
velleities
and
that
of
volitions
for
whether
the
act
of
willing
be
impressed
upon
us
by
an
external
cause
or
we
bring
it
about
ourselves
it
will
be
equally
true
that
we
will
and
that
we
feel
that
we
will
moreover
as
this
external
cause
can
blend
as
much
pleasure
as
it
will
with
the
volition
which
it
impresses
upon
us
we
shall
be
able
to
feel
at
times
that
the
acts
of
our
will
please
us
infinitely
and
that
they
lead
us
according
to
the
bent
of
our
strongest
inclinations
we
shall
feel
no
constraint
you
know
the
maxim
non
potest
do
you
not
clearly
understand
that
a
always
having
communicated
to
it
simultaneously
in
such
a
way
however
that
priority
of
nature
or
if
one
will
a
real
momentary
priority
should
attach
to
the
desire
for
motion
movement
towards
a
certain
point
on
the
horizon
and
the
wish
to
turn
in
that
direction
would
be
persuaded
that
it
moved
of
itself
to
fulfil
the
desires
which
it
conceived
i
assume
that
it
would
not
know
that
there
were
winds
or
that
an
external
cause
changed
everything
simultaneously
both
its
situation
and
its
desires
that
is
the
state
we
are
in
by
our
nature
we
know
not
whether
an
invisible
cause
makes
us
pass
sufficiently
from
one
thought
to
another
it
is
therefore
natural
that
men
are
persuaded
that
they
determine
their
own
acts
but
it
remains
to
be
discovered
whether
they
are
mistaken
in
that
as
in
countless
other
things
they
affirm
by
a
kind
of
instinct
and
without
having
made
use
of
philosophic
meditation
since
therefore
there
are
two
hypotheses
as
to
what
takes
place
in
man
the
one
that
he
is
only
a
passive
subject
the
other
that
he
has
active
virtues
one
can
not
in
reason
prefer
the
second
to
the
first
so
long
as
one
can
only
adduce
proofs
of
feeling
for
we
should
feel
with
an
equal
force
that
we
wish
this
or
that
whether
all
our
volitions
were
imprinted
upon
our
soul
by
an
exterior
and
invisible
cause
or
we
formed
them
ourselves
there
are
here
excellent
arguments
which
are
valid
against
the
usual
systems
but
they
fail
in
respect
of
the
system
of
harmony
which
takes
us
further
than
we
were
able
to
go
formerly
bayle
asserts
for
instance
by
purely
philosophical
meditations
one
can
never
attain
to
an
established
certainty
that
we
are
the
efficient
cause
of
our
volitions
but
this
is
a
point
which
i
do
not
concede
to
him
for
the
establishment
of
this
system
demonstrates
beyond
a
doubt
that
in
the
course
of
nature
each
substance
is
the
sole
cause
of
all
its
actions
and
that
it
is
free
of
all
physical
influence
from
every
other
substance
save
the
customary
of
god
and
this
system
shows
that
our
spontaneity
is
real
and
not
only
apparent
as
herr
wittich
believed
it
to
be
bayle
asserts
also
on
the
same
reasons
ch
that
if
there
were
a
this
would
not
destroy
freedom
and
i
would
concede
that
to
him
if
freedom
consisted
only
in
an
apparent
spontaneity
the
spontaneity
of
our
actions
can
therefore
no
longer
be
questioned
and
aristotle
has
defined
it
well
saying
that
an
action
is
when
its
source
is
in
him
who
acts
est
cujus
principium
est
in
agente
thus
it
is
that
our
actions
and
our
wills
depend
entirely
upon
us
it
is
true
that
we
are
not
directly
the
masters
of
our
will
although
we
be
its
cause
for
we
do
not
choose
volitions
as
we
choose
our
actions
by
our
volitions
yet
we
have
a
certain
power
also
over
our
will
because
we
can
contribute
indirectly
towards
willing
another
time
that
which
we
would
fain
will
now
as
i
have
here
already
shown
that
however
is
no
properly
speaking
there
also
we
have
a
mastery
individual
and
even
perceptible
over
our
actions
and
our
wills
resulting
from
a
combination
of
spontaneity
with
intelligence
up
to
this
point
i
have
expounded
the
two
conditions
of
freedom
mentioned
by
aristotle
that
is
and
which
are
found
united
in
us
in
deliberation
whereas
beasts
lack
the
second
condition
but
the
schoolmen
demand
yet
a
third
which
they
call
and
indeed
one
must
admit
it
if
indifference
signifies
as
much
as
for
i
have
already
said
here
that
freedom
must
exclude
an
absolute
and
metaphysical
or
logical
necessity
but
as
i
have
declared
more
than
once
this
indifference
this
contingency
this
if
i
may
venture
so
to
speak
which
is
a
characteristic
attribute
of
freedom
does
not
prevent
one
from
having
stronger
inclinations
towards
the
course
one
chooses
nor
does
it
by
any
means
require
that
one
be
absolutely
and
equally
indifferent
towards
the
two
opposing
courses
i
therefore
admit
indifference
only
in
the
one
sense
implying
the
same
as
contingency
or
but
as
i
have
declared
more
than
once
i
do
not
admit
an
indifference
of
equipoise
and
i
do
not
think
that
one
ever
chooses
when
one
is
absolutely
indifferent
such
a
choice
would
be
as
it
were
mere
chance
without
determining
reason
whether
apparent
or
hidden
but
such
a
chance
such
an
absolute
and
actual
fortuity
is
a
chimera
which
never
occurs
in
nature
all
wise
men
are
agreed
that
chance
is
only
an
apparent
thing
like
fortune
only
ignorance
of
causes
gives
rise
to
it
but
if
there
were
such
a
vague
indifference
or
rather
if
we
were
to
choose
without
having
anything
to
prompt
us
to
the
choice
chance
would
then
be
something
actual
resembling
what
according
to
epicurus
took
place
in
that
little
deviation
of
the
atoms
occurring
without
cause
or
reason
epicurus
had
introduced
it
in
order
to
evade
necessity
and
cicero
with
good
reason
ridiculed
it
this
deviation
had
a
final
cause
in
the
mind
of
epicurus
his
aim
being
to
free
us
from
fate
but
it
can
have
no
efficient
cause
in
the
nature
of
things
it
is
one
of
the
most
impossible
of
chimeras
bayle
himself
refutes
it
admirably
as
we
shall
see
presently
and
yet
it
is
surprising
that
he
appears
to
admit
elsewhere
himself
something
of
like
nature
with
this
supposed
deviation
here
is
what
he
says
when
speaking
of
buridan
ass
art
lit
who
advocate
free
will
properly
so
called
admit
in
man
a
power
of
determining
either
to
the
right
hand
or
the
left
even
when
the
motives
are
perfectly
uniform
on
the
side
of
each
of
the
two
opposing
objects
for
they
maintain
that
our
soul
can
say
without
having
any
reason
other
than
that
of
using
its
freedom
i
prefer
this
to
that
although
i
see
nothing
more
worthy
of
my
choice
in
the
one
than
the
other
all
those
who
admit
a
free
will
properly
so
called
will
not
for
that
reason
concede
to
bayle
this
determination
springing
from
an
indeterminate
cause
augustine
and
the
thomists
believe
that
all
is
determined
and
one
sees
that
their
opponents
resort
also
to
the
circumstances
which
contribute
to
our
choice
experience
by
no
means
approves
the
chimera
of
an
indifference
of
equipoise
and
one
can
employ
here
the
argument
that
bayle
himself
employed
against
the
manner
of
proving
freedom
by
the
lively
sense
of
our
independence
for
although
i
do
not
always
see
the
reason
for
an
inclination
which
makes
me
choose
between
two
apparently
uniform
courses
there
will
always
be
some
impression
however
imperceptible
that
determines
us
the
mere
desire
to
make
use
of
one
freedom
has
no
effect
of
specifying
or
determining
us
to
the
choice
of
one
course
or
the
other
bayle
goes
on
are
at
the
very
least
two
ways
whereby
man
can
extricate
himself
from
the
snares
of
equipoise
one
which
i
have
already
mentioned
is
for
a
man
to
flatter
himself
with
the
pleasing
fancy
that
he
is
master
in
his
own
house
and
that
he
does
not
depend
upon
objects
this
way
is
blocked
for
all
that
one
might
wish
to
play
master
in
one
own
house
that
has
no
determining
effect
nor
does
it
favour
one
course
more
than
the
other
bayle
goes
on
would
make
this
act
i
will
prefer
this
to
that
because
it
pleases
me
to
behave
thus
but
these
words
it
pleases
me
such
is
my
pleasure
imply
already
a
leaning
towards
object
that
pleases
there
is
therefore
no
justification
for
continuing
thus
so
that
which
determined
him
would
not
be
taken
from
the
object
the
motive
would
be
derived
only
from
the
ideas
men
have
of
their
own
perfections
or
of
their
natural
faculties
the
other
way
is
that
of
the
lot
or
chance
the
short
straw
would
decide
this
way
has
an
outlet
but
it
does
not
reach
the
goal
it
would
alter
the
issue
for
in
such
a
case
it
is
not
man
who
decides
or
again
if
one
maintains
that
it
is
still
the
man
who
decides
by
lot
man
himself
is
no
longer
in
equipoise
because
the
lot
is
not
and
the
man
has
attached
himself
to
it
there
are
always
reasons
in
nature
which
cause
that
which
happens
by
chance
or
through
the
lot
i
am
somewhat
surprised
that
a
mind
so
shrewd
as
bayle
could
have
allowed
itself
to
be
so
misled
on
this
point
i
have
set
out
elsewhere
the
true
rejoinder
to
the
buridan
sophism
it
is
that
the
case
of
perfect
equipoise
is
impossible
since
the
universe
can
never
be
halved
so
as
to
make
all
impressions
equivalent
on
both
sides
let
us
see
what
bayle
himself
says
elsewhere
against
the
chimerical
or
absolutely
undefined
indifference
cicero
had
said
in
his
book
that
carneades
had
found
something
more
subtle
than
the
deviation
of
atoms
attributing
the
cause
of
a
absolutely
undefined
indifference
to
the
voluntary
motions
of
souls
because
these
motions
have
no
need
of
an
external
cause
coming
as
they
do
from
our
nature
but
bayle
art
aptly
replies
that
all
that
which
springs
from
the
nature
of
a
thing
is
determined
thus
determination
always
remains
and
carneades
evasion
is
of
no
avail
he
shows
elsewhere
to
the
questions
of
a
ch
a
freedom
far
removed
from
this
equipoise
is
incomparably
more
beneficial
i
mean
he
says
freedom
such
as
may
always
follow
the
judgements
of
the
mind
and
such
as
can
not
resist
objects
clearly
recognized
as
good
i
know
of
no
people
who
do
not
agree
that
truth
clearly
recognized
necessitates
determines
rather
unless
one
speak
of
a
moral
necessity
assent
of
the
soul
experience
teaches
us
that
in
the
schools
they
teach
constantly
that
as
the
true
is
the
object
of
the
understanding
so
the
good
is
the
object
of
the
will
so
likewise
they
teach
that
as
the
understanding
can
never
affirm
anything
save
that
which
is
shown
to
it
under
the
semblance
of
truth
the
will
can
never
love
anything
which
to
it
does
not
appear
to
be
good
one
never
believes
the
false
as
such
and
one
never
loves
evil
as
evil
there
is
in
the
understanding
a
natural
determination
towards
the
true
in
general
and
towards
each
individual
truth
clearly
recognized
there
is
in
the
will
a
natural
determination
towards
good
in
general
whence
many
philosophers
conclude
that
from
the
moment
when
individual
goods
are
clearly
recognized
by
us
we
are
of
necessity
compelled
to
love
them
the
understanding
suspends
its
actions
only
when
its
objects
show
themselves
obscurely
so
that
there
is
cause
for
doubt
as
to
whether
they
are
false
or
true
that
leads
many
persons
to
the
conclusion
that
the
will
remains
in
equipoise
only
when
the
soul
is
uncertain
whether
the
object
presented
to
it
is
a
good
with
regard
to
it
but
that
also
the
moment
the
soul
decides
in
the
affirmative
it
of
necessity
clings
to
that
object
until
other
judgements
of
the
mind
determine
it
otherwise
those
who
expound
freedom
in
this
fashion
think
to
find
therein
plentiful
enough
material
for
merit
or
demerit
for
they
assume
that
these
judgements
of
the
mind
proceed
from
a
free
attention
of
the
soul
in
examining
the
objects
comparing
them
together
and
discriminating
between
them
i
must
not
forget
that
there
are
very
learned
men
such
as
bellarmine
lib
gratia
et
libero
et
and
cameron
in
ad
epistolam
viri
docti
id
est
maintain
with
very
cogent
reasons
that
the
will
always
of
necessity
follows
the
last
practical
act
of
the
understanding
one
must
make
some
observations
on
this
discourse
a
very
clear
recognition
of
the
best
the
will
but
it
does
not
necessitate
it
properly
speaking
one
must
always
distinguish
between
the
necessary
and
the
certain
or
infallible
as
i
have
already
observed
more
than
once
and
distinguish
metaphysical
necessity
from
moral
necessity
i
think
also
that
it
is
only
god
will
which
always
follows
the
judgements
of
the
understanding
all
intelligent
creatures
are
subject
to
some
passions
or
to
perceptions
at
least
that
are
not
composed
entirely
of
what
i
call
and
although
in
the
blessed
these
passions
always
tend
towards
the
true
good
by
virtue
of
the
laws
of
nature
and
the
system
of
things
in
relation
to
them
yet
this
does
not
always
happen
in
such
a
way
that
they
have
a
perfect
knowledge
of
that
good
it
is
the
same
with
them
as
with
us
who
do
not
always
understand
the
reason
for
our
instincts
the
angels
and
the
blessed
are
created
beings
even
as
we
are
in
whom
there
is
always
some
confused
perception
mingled
with
distinct
knowledge
suarez
said
something
similar
concerning
them
he
thinks
on
book
i
ch
that
god
has
so
ordered
things
beforehand
that
their
prayers
when
they
are
made
with
a
full
will
always
succeed
that
is
an
example
of
a
harmony
as
for
us
in
addition
to
the
judgement
of
the
understanding
of
which
we
have
an
express
knowledge
there
are
mingled
therewith
confused
perceptions
of
the
senses
and
these
beget
passions
and
even
imperceptible
inclinations
of
which
we
are
not
always
aware
these
movements
often
thwart
the
judgement
of
the
practical
understanding
as
for
the
parallel
between
the
relation
of
the
understanding
to
the
true
and
that
of
the
will
to
the
good
one
must
know
that
a
clear
and
distinct
perception
of
a
truth
contains
within
it
actually
the
affirmation
of
this
truth
thus
the
understanding
is
necessitated
in
that
direction
but
whatever
perception
one
may
have
of
the
good
the
effort
to
act
in
accordance
with
the
judgement
which
in
my
opinion
forms
the
essence
of
the
will
is
distinct
from
it
thus
since
there
is
need
of
time
to
raise
this
effort
to
its
climax
it
may
be
suspended
and
even
changed
by
a
new
perception
or
inclination
which
passes
athwart
it
which
diverts
the
mind
from
it
and
which
even
causes
it
sometimes
to
make
a
contrary
judgement
hence
it
comes
that
our
soul
has
so
many
means
of
resisting
the
truth
which
it
knows
and
that
the
passage
from
mind
to
heart
is
so
long
especially
is
this
so
when
the
understanding
to
a
great
extent
proceeds
only
by
faint
which
have
only
slight
power
to
affect
as
i
have
explained
elsewhere
thus
the
connexion
between
judgement
and
will
is
not
so
necessary
as
one
might
think
bayle
goes
on
to
say
with
truth
it
can
not
be
a
fault
in
man
soul
that
it
has
no
freedom
of
indifference
as
regards
good
in
general
it
would
be
rather
a
disorder
an
inordinate
imperfection
if
one
could
say
truthfully
it
is
all
one
to
me
whether
i
am
happy
or
unhappy
i
have
no
more
determination
to
love
the
good
than
to
hate
it
i
can
do
both
equally
now
if
it
is
a
praiseworthy
and
advantageous
quality
to
be
determinate
as
regards
good
in
general
it
can
not
be
a
fault
if
one
is
necessitated
as
regards
each
individual
good
recognized
plainly
as
for
our
good
it
seems
even
as
though
it
were
a
necessary
conclusion
that
if
the
soul
has
no
freedom
of
indifference
as
regards
good
in
general
it
also
has
none
in
respect
of
particular
goods
which
after
due
examination
it
judges
to
be
goods
in
relation
to
it
what
should
we
think
of
a
soul
which
having
formed
that
judgement
had
and
prided
itself
on
having
the
power
not
to
love
these
goods
and
even
to
hate
them
and
which
said
i
recognize
clearly
that
these
are
goods
for
me
i
have
all
the
enlightenment
necessary
on
that
point
nevertheless
i
will
not
love
them
i
will
hate
them
my
decision
is
made
i
act
upon
it
it
is
not
that
any
reason
that
is
any
other
reason
than
that
which
is
founded
upon
is
my
good
pleasure
me
thereto
but
it
pleases
me
so
to
behave
what
should
we
think
i
say
of
such
a
soul
should
we
not
find
it
more
imperfect
and
more
unhappy
than
if
it
had
not
this
freedom
of
indifference
only
does
the
doctrine
that
subjects
the
will
to
the
final
acts
of
the
understanding
give
a
more
favourable
idea
of
the
state
of
the
soul
but
it
shows
also
that
it
is
easier
to
lead
man
to
happiness
along
that
road
than
along
the
road
of
indifference
it
will
suffice
to
enlighten
his
mind
upon
his
true
interests
and
straightway
his
will
will
comply
with
the
judgements
that
reason
shall
have
pronounced
but
if
he
has
a
freedom
independent
of
reason
and
of
the
quality
of
objects
clearly
recognized
he
will
be
the
most
intractable
of
all
animals
and
it
will
never
be
possible
to
rely
upon
making
him
choose
the
right
course
all
the
counsels
all
the
arguments
in
the
world
may
prove
unavailing
you
will
give
him
explanations
you
will
convince
his
mind
and
yet
his
will
will
play
the
haughty
madam
and
remain
motionless
as
a
rock
vergil
lib
magis
incepto
vultum
sermone
movetur
si
dura
silex
aut

marpesia
a
caprice
an
empty
whim
will
make
her
stiffen
against
reasons
of
all
kinds
it
will
not
please
her
to
love
her
clearly
recognized
good
it
will
please
her
to
hate
it
do
you
consider
such
a
faculty
sir
to
be
the
richest
present
god
can
have
made
to
man
and
the
sole
instrument
of
our
happiness
is
it
not
rather
an
obstacle
to
our
felicity
is
there
cause
for
boasting
in
being
able
to
say
i
have
scorned
all
the
judgements
of
my
reason
and
i
have
followed
an
altogether
different
path
simply
from
considerations
of
my
own
good
pleasure
with
what
regrets
would
one
not
be
torn
in
that
case
if
the
determination
made
had
an
ill
result
such
a
freedom
would
therefore
be
more
harmful
than
profitable
to
men
because
the
understanding
would
not
present
all
the
goodness
of
the
objects
clearly
enough
to
deprive
the
will
of
the
power
of
rejection
it
would
be
therefore
infinitely
better
for
man
to
be
always
of
necessity
determined
by
the
judgement
of
the
understanding
than
to
permit
the
will
to
suspend
its
action
for
by
this
means
it
would
achieve
its
aim
with
greater
ease
and
certainty
upon
this
discourse
i
make
the
further
observation
that
it
is
very
true
that
a
freedom
of
indifference
undefined
and
without
any
determining
reason
would
be
as
harmful
and
even
objectionable
as
it
is
impracticable
and
chimerical
the
man
who
wished
to
behave
thus
or
at
the
least
appear
to
be
acting
without
due
cause
would
most
certainly
be
looked
upon
as
irrational
but
it
is
very
true
also
that
the
thing
is
impossible
when
it
is
taken
strictly
in
accordance
with
the
assumption
as
soon
as
one
tries
to
give
an
example
of
it
one
misses
one
aim
and
stumbles
upon
the
case
of
a
man
who
while
he
does
not
come
to
a
decision
without
cause
does
so
rather
under
the
influence
of
inclination
or
passion
than
of
judgement
as
soon
as
one
says
scorn
the
judgements
of
my
reason
simply
from
considerations
of
my
own
good
pleasure
it
pleases
me
to
behave
thus
it
is
as
if
one
were
to
say
i
prefer
my
inclination
to
my
interest
my
pleasure
to
my
profit
even
so
some
capricious
man
fancying
that
it
is
ignominious
for
him
to
follow
the
advice
of
his
friends
or
his
servants
might
prefer
the
satisfaction
of
contradicting
them
to
the
profit
he
could
derive
from
their
counsel
it
may
happen
however
that
in
a
matter
of
small
moment
a
wise
man
acts
irregularly
and
against
his
own
interest
in
order
to
thwart
another
who
tries
to
restrain
him
or
direct
him
or
that
he
may
disconcert
those
who
watch
his
steps
it
is
even
well
at
times
to
imitate
brutus
by
concealing
one
wit
and
even
to
feign
madness
as
david
did
before
the
king
of
the
philistines
bayle
admirably
supplements
his
remarks
with
the
object
of
showing
that
to
act
against
the
judgement
of
the
understanding
would
be
a
great
imperfection
he
observes
that
even
according
to
the
molinists
understanding
which
does
its
duty
well
indicates
that
which
is
the
best
he
introduces
god
ch
saying
to
our
first
parents
in
the
garden
of
eden
have
given
you
my
knowledge
the
faculty
of
judging
things
and
full
power
to
dispose

their
reason
which
had
not

by

would
have
made

conclude
that
they
must
ask
god
as

point
of
the
favours
wherewith
he
had
honoured
them
not
to
permit
them
to
destroy
themselves
by
an
ill

of

must
one
not
admit
that
if
adam
through
wrongly
making
it
a
point
of
honour
to
order
his
own
goings
had
refused
a
divine
direction
that
would
have
safeguarded

he
would
have
been
the
prototype
of

such
as
phaeton

icarus
he
would
have
been
as
ungodly
as
the
ajax
of

wished
to
conquer
without
the

of

who
said
that
the

craven
would
put

that

congratulates
oneself
no

even
takes
more
credit
to
oneself
for
having
been
aided
from
above
than
for
owing

and
if
one
does
well
through
having
preferred
a
tumultuous
instinct
which
arose
suddenly
to

maturely
considered

feels
an
extraordinary

bayle
adds
ch
stoic
philosopher
who
attaches
to
everything
an
inevitable
necessity
is
as
susceptible
as
another
man
to
the
pleasure
of
having
chosen
well
and
every
man
of
sense
will
find
that
far
from
taking
pleasure
in
the
thought
of
having
deliberated
long
and
finally
chosen
the
most
honourable
course
one
feels
incredible
satisfaction
in
persuading
oneself
that
one
is
so
firmly
rooted
in
the
love
of
virtue
that
without
the
slightest
resistance
one
would
repel
a
temptation
a
man
to
whom
is
suggested
the
doing
of
a
deed
contrary
to
his
duty
his
honour
and
his
conscience
who
answers
forthwith
that
he
is
incapable
of
such
a
crime
and
who
is
certainly
not
capable
of
it
is
far
more
contented
with
himself
than
if
he
asked
for
time
to
consider
it
and
were
for
some
hours
in
a
state
of
indecision
as
to
which
course
to
take
one
is
on
many
occasions
regretful
over
not
being
able
to
make
up
mind
between
two
courses
and
one
would
be
well
pleased
that
the
counsel
of
a
good
friend
or
some
succour
from
above
should
impel
us
to
make
a
good
choice
all
that
demonstrates
for
us
the
advantage
a
determinate
judgement
has
over
that
vague
indifference
which
leaves
us
in
uncertainty
but
indeed
i
have
proved
sufficiently
that
only
ignorance
or
passion
has
power
to
keep
us
in
doubt
and
have
thus
given
the
reason
why
god
is
never
in
doubt
the
nearer
one
comes
to
him
the
more
perfect
is
freedom
and
the
more
it
is
determined
by
the
good
and
by
reason
the
character
of
cato
of
whom
velleius
said
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
perform
a
dishonourable
action
will
always
be
preferred
to
that
of
a
man
who
is
capable
of
wavering
i
have
been
well
pleased
to
present
and
to
support
these
arguments
of
bayle
against
vague
indifference
as
much
for
the
elucidation
of
the
subject
as
to
confront
him
with
himself
and
to
demonstrate
that
he
ought
therefore
not
to
complain
of
the
alleged
necessity
imposed
upon
god
of
choosing
the
best
way
that
is
possible
for
either
god
will
act
through
a
vague
indifference
and
at
random
or
again
he
will
act
on
caprice
or
through
some
other
passion
or
finally
he
must
act
through
a
prevailing
inclination
of
reason
which
prompts
him
to
the
best
but
passions
which
come
from
the
confused
perception
of
an
apparent
good
can
not
occur
in
god
and
vague
indifference
is
something
chimerical
it
is
therefore
only
the
strongest
reason
that
can
regulate
god
choice
it
is
an
imperfection
in
our
freedom
that
makes
us
capable
of
choosing
evil
instead
of
good
a
greater
evil
instead
of
the
lesser
evil
the
lesser
good
instead
of
the
greater
good
that
arises
from
the
appearances
of
good
and
evil
which
deceive
us
whereas
god
is
always
prompted
to
the
true
and
the
greatest
good
that
is
to
the
absolutely
true
good
which
he
can
not
fail
to
know
this
false
idea
of
freedom
conceived
by
those
who
not
content
with
exempting
it
i
do
not
say
from
constraint
but
from
necessity
itself
would
also
exempt
it
from
certainty
and
determination
that
is
from
reason
and
perfection
nevertheless
pleased
some
schoolmen
people
who
often
become
entangled
in
their
own
subtleties
and
take
the
straw
of
terms
for
the
grain
of
things
they
assume
some
chimerical
notion
whence
they
think
to
derive
some
use
and
which
they
endeavour
to
maintain
by
quibblings
complete
indifference
is
of
this
nature
to
concede
it
to
the
will
is
to
grant
it
a
privilege
of
the
kind
that
some
cartesians
and
some
mystics
find
in
the
divine
nature
of
being
able
to
do
the
impossible
to
produce
absurdities
to
cause
two
contradictory
propositions
to
be
true
simultaneously
to
claim
that
a
determination
comes
from
a
complete
indifference
absolutely
indeterminate
is
to
claim
that
it
comes
naturally
from
nothing
let
it
be
assumed
that
god
does
not
give
this
determination
it
has
accordingly
no
fountainhead
in
the
soul
nor
in
the
body
nor
in
circumstances
since
all
is
assumed
to
be
indeterminate
and
yet
there
it
is
appearing
and
existing
without
preparation
nothing
making
ready
for
it
no
angel
not
even
god
himself
being
able
to
see
or
to
show
how
it
exists
that
would
be
not
only
the
emergence
of
something
from
nothing
but
its
emergence
thence
this
doctrine
introduces
something
as
preposterous
as
the
theory
already
mentioned
of
the
deviation
of
atoms
whereby
epicurus
asserted
that
one
of
these
small
bodies
going
in
a
straight
line
would
turn
aside
all
at
once
from
its
path
without
any
reason
simply
because
the
will
so
commands
take
note
moreover
that
he
resorted
to
that
only
to
justify
this
alleged
freedom
of
complete
indifference
a
chimerical
notion
which
appears
to
be
of
very
ancient
origin
and
one
may
with
good
reason
say
chimaeram
this
is
the
way
signor
marchetti
has
expressed
it
in
his
admirable
translation
of
lucretius
into
italian
verse
which
has
not
yet
been
published
book

it
is
comical
that
a
man
like
epicurus
after
having
discarded
the
gods
and
all
incorporeal
substances
could
have
supposed
that
the
will
which
he
himself
takes
as
composed
of
atoms
could
have
had
control
over
the
atoms
and
diverted
them
from
their
path
without
its
being
possible
for
one
to
say
how
carneades
not
going
so
far
back
as
to
the
atoms
claimed
to
find
at
once
in
the
soul
of
man
the
reason
for
the
vague
indifference
assuming
as
reason
for
the
thing
just
that
for
which
epicurus
sought
a
reason
carneades
gained
nothing
thereby
except
that
he
more
easily
deceived
careless
people
in
transferring
the
absurdity
from
one
subject
where
it
is
somewhat
too
evident
to
another
subject
where
it
is
easier
to
confuse
matters
that
is
to
say
from
the
body
to
the
soul
for
most
philosophers
had
not
very
distinct
notions
of
the
nature
of
the
soul
epicurus
who
composed
it
of
atoms
was
at
least
right
in
seeking
the
origin
of
its
determination
in
that
which
he
believed
to
be
the
origin
of
the
soul
itself
that
is
why
cicero
and
bayle
were
wrong
to
find
so
much
fault
with
him
and
to
be
indulgent
towards
and
even
praise
carneades
who
is
no
less
irrational
i
do
not
understand
how
bayle
who
was
so
was
thus
satisfied
by
a
disguised
absurdity
even
to
the
extent
of
calling
it
the
greatest
effort
the
human
mind
can
make
on
this
matter
it
is
as
if
the
soul
which
is
the
seat
of
reason
were
more
capable
than
the
body
of
acting
without
being
determined
by
some
reason
or
cause
internal
or
external
or
as
if
the
great
principle
which
states
that
nothing
comes
to
pass
without
cause
only
related
to
the
body
it
is
true
that
the
form
or
the
soul
has
this
advantage
over
matter
that
it
is
the
source
of
action
having
within
itself
the
principle
of
motion
or
of
change
in
a
word
greek
to
autokinêton
as
plato
calls
it
whereas
matter
is
simply
passive
and
has
need
of
being
impelled
to
act
ut
but
if
the
soul
is
active
of
itself
as
it
indeed
is
for
that
very
reason
it
is
not
of
itself
absolutely
indifferent
to
the
action
like
matter
and
it
must
find
in
itself
a
ground
of
determination
according
to
the
system
of
harmony
the
soul
finds
in
itself
and
in
its
ideal
nature
anterior
to
existence
the
reasons
for
its
determinations
adjusted
to
all
that
shall
surround
it
that
way
it
was
determined
from
all
eternity
in
its
state
of
mere
possibility
to
act
freely
as
it
does
when
it
attains
to
existence
bayle
himself
remarks
aptly
that
freedom
of
indifference
such
as
must
be
admitted
does
not
exclude
inclinations
and
does
not
demand
equipoise
he
demonstrates
amply
enough
to
the
questions
of
a
ch
that
the
soul
may
be
compared
to
a
balance
where
reasons
and
inclinations
take
the
place
of
weights
according
to
him
one
can
explain
what
passes
in
our
resolutions
by
the
hypothesis
that
the
will
of
man
is
like
a
balance
which
is
at
rest
when
the
weights
of
its
two
pans
are
equal
and
which
always
inclines
either
to
one
side
or
the
other
according
to
which
of
the
pans
is
the
more
heavily
laden
a
new
reason
makes
a
heavier
weight
a
new
idea
shines
more
brightly
than
the
old
the
fear
of
a
heavy
penalty
prevails
over
some
pleasure
when
two
passions
dispute
the
ground
it
is
always
the
stronger
which
gains
the
mastery
unless
the
other
be
assisted
by
reason
or
by
some
other
contributing
passion
when
one
flings
away
merchandise
in
order
to
save
oneself
the
action
which
the
schoolmen
call
mixed
is
voluntary
and
free
and
yet
love
of
life
indubitably
prevails
over
love
of
possessions
grief
arises
from
remembrance
of
lost
possessions
and
one
has
all
the
greater
difficulty
in
making
one
resolve
the
nearer
the
approach
to
even
weight
in
the
opposing
reasons
as
also
we
see
that
the
balance
is
determined
more
promptly
when
there
is
a
great
difference
between
the
weights
nevertheless
as
very
often
there
are
divers
courses
to
choose
from
one
might
instead
of
the
balance
compare
the
soul
with
a
force
which
puts
forth
effort
on
various
sides
simultaneously
but
which
acts
only
at
the
spot
where
action
is
easiest
or
there
is
least
resistance
for
instance
air
if
it
is
compressed
too
firmly
in
a
glass
vessel
will
break
it
in
order
to
escape
it
puts
forth
effort
at
every
part
but
finally
flings
itself
upon
the
weakest
thus
do
the
inclinations
of
the
soul
extend
over
all
the
goods
that
present
themselves
they
are
antecedent
acts
of
will
but
the
consequent
will
which
is
their
result
is
determined
in
the
direction
of
that
which
touches
most
closely
this
ascendancy
of
inclinations
however
does
not
prevent
man
from
being
master
in
his
own
domain
provided
that
he
knows
how
to
make
use
of
his
power
his
dominion
is
that
of
reason
he
has
only
to
prepare
himself
in
good
time
to
resist
the
passions
and
he
will
be
capable
of
checking
the
vehemence
of
the
most
furious
let
us
assume
that
augustus
about
to
give
orders
for
putting
to
death
fabius
maximus
acts
as
is
his
wont
upon
the
advice
a
philosopher
had
given
him
to
recite
the
greek
alphabet
before
doing
anything
in
the
first
heat
of
his
anger
this
reflexion
will
be
capable
of
saving
the
life
of
fabius
and
the
glory
of
augustus
but
without
some
fortunate
reflexion
which
one
owes
sometimes
to
a
special
divine
mercy
or
without
some
skill
acquired
beforehand
like
that
of
augustus
calculated
to
make
us
reflect
fittingly
as
to
time
and
place
passion
will
prevail
over
reason
the
driver
is
master
over
the
horses
if
he
controls
them
as
he
should
and
as
he
can
but
there
are
occasions
when
he
becomes
negligent
and
then
for
a
time
he
will
have
to
let
go
the
reins
equis
auriga
nec
audit
currus
one
must
admit
that
there
is
always
within
us
enough
power
over
our
will
but
we
do
not
always
bethink
ourselves
of
employing
it
that
shows
as
i
have
observed
more
than
once
that
the
power
of
the
soul
over
its
inclinations
is
a
control
which
can
only
be
exercised
in
an
manner
almost
as
bellarmine
would
have
had
the
popes
exercise
rights
over
the
temporal
power
of
kings
in
truth
the
external
actions
that
do
not
exceed
our
powers
depend
absolutely
upon
our
will
but
our
volitions
depend
upon
our
will
only
through
certain
artful
twists
which
give
us
means
of
suspending
our
resolutions
or
of
changing
them
we
are
masters
in
our
own
house
not
as
god
is
in
the
world
he
having
but
to
speak
but
as
a
wise
prince
is
in
his
dominions
or
as
a
good
father
of
a
family
is
in
his
home
bayle
sometimes
takes
the
matter
differently
as
though
we
must
have
in
order
to
boast
of
a
free
will
an
absolute
power
over
ourselves
independent
of
reasons
and
of
means
but
even
god
has
not
such
a
power
and
must
not
have
in
this
sense
in
relation
to
his
will
he
can
not
change
his
nature
nor
act
otherwise
than
according
to
method
and
how
could
man
transform
himself
all
of
a
sudden
i
have
already
said
god
dominion
the
dominion
of
wisdom
is
that
of
reason
it
is
only
god
however
who
always
wills
what
is
most
to
be
desired
and
consequently
he
has
no
need
of
the
power
to
change
his
will
if
the
soul
is
mistress
in
its
own
house
says
bayle
it
has
only
to
will
and
straightway
that
vexation
and
pain
which
is
attendant
upon
victory
over
the
passions
will
vanish
away
for
this
effect
it
would
suffice
in
his
opinion
to
give
oneself
indifference
to
the
objects
of
the
passions
why
then
do
men
not
give
themselves
this
indifference
he
says
if
they
are
masters
in
their
own
house
but
this
objection
is
exactly
as
if
i
were
to
ask
why
a
father
of
a
family
does
not
give
himself
gold
when
he
has
need
thereof
he
can
acquire
some
but
through
skill
and
not
as
in
the
age
of
the
fairies
or
of
king
midas
through
a
mere
command
of
the
will
or
by
his
touch
it
would
not
suffice
to
be
master
in
one
own
house
one
must
be
master
of
all
things
in
order
to
give
oneself
all
that
one
wishes
for
one
does
not
find
everything
in
one
own
house
working
thus
upon
oneself
one
must
do
as
in
working
upon
something
else
one
must
have
knowledge
of
the
constitution
and
the
qualities
of
one
object
and
adapt
one
operations
thereto
it
is
therefore
not
in
a
moment
and
by
a
mere
act
of
the
will
that
one
corrects
oneself
and
that
one
acquires
a
better
will
nevertheless
it
is
well
to
observe
that
the
vexations
and
pains
attendant
upon
victory
over
the
passions
in
some
people
turn
into
pleasure
through
the
great
satisfaction
they
find
in
the
lively
sense
of
the
force
of
their
mind
and
of
the
divine
grace
ascetics
and
true
mystics
can
speak
of
this
from
experience
and
even
a
true
philosopher
can
say
something
thereof
one
can
attain
to
that
happy
state
and
it
is
one
of
the
principal
means
the
soul
can
use
to
strengthen
its
dominion
if
the
scotists
and
the
molinists
appear
to
favour
vague
indifference
appear
i
say
for
i
doubt
whether
they
do
so
in
reality
once
they
have
learnt
to
know
it
the
thomists
and
the
disciples
of
augustine
are
for
predetermination
for
one
must
have
either
the
one
or
the
other
thomas
aquinas
is
a
writer
who
is
accustomed
to
reason
on
sound
principles
and
the
subtle
scotus
seeking
to
contradict
him
often
obscures
matters
instead
of
throwing
light
upon
them
the
thomists
as
a
general
rule
follow
their
master
and
do
not
admit
that
the
soul
makes
its
resolve
without
the
existence
of
some
predetermination
which
contributes
thereto
but
the
predetermination
of
the
new
thomists
is
not
perhaps
exactly
that
which
one
needs
durand
de
who
often
enough
formed
a
party
of
his
own
and
who
opposed
the
idea
of
the
special
of
god
was
nevertheless
in
favour
of
a
certain
predetermination
he
believed
that
god
saw
in
the
state
of
the
soul
and
of
its
surroundings
the
reason
for
his
determinations
the
ancient
stoics
were
in
that
almost
of
the
same
opinion
as
the
thomists
they
were
at
the
same
time
in
favour
of
determination
and
against
necessity
although
they
have
been
accused
of
attaching
necessity
to
everything
cicero
says
in
his
book
that
democritus
heraclitus
empedocles
and
aristotle
believed
that
fate
implied
necessity
that
others
were
opposed
to
that
he
means
perhaps
epicurus
and
the
academicians
and
that
chrysippus
sought
a
middle
course
i
think
that
cicero
is
mistaken
as
regards
aristotle
who
fully
recognized
contingency
and
freedom
and
went
even
too
far
saying
inadvertently
as
i
think
that
propositions
on
contingent
futurities
had
no
determinate
truth
on
which
point
he
was
justifiably
abandoned
by
most
of
the
schoolmen
even
cleanthes
the
teacher
of
chrysippus
although
he
upheld
the
determinate
truth
of
future
events
denied
their
necessity
had
the
schoolmen
so
fully
convinced
of
this
determination
of
contingent
futurities
as
were
for
instance
the
fathers
of
coimbra
authors
of
a
famous
course
of
philosophy
seen
the
connexion
between
things
in
the
form
wherein
the
system
of
general
harmony
proclaims
it
they
would
have
judged
that
one
can
not
admit
preliminary
certainty
or
determination
of
futurition
without
admitting
a
predetermination
of
the
thing
in
its
causes
and
in
its
reasons
cicero
has
endeavoured
to
expound
for
us
the
middle
course
taken
by
chrysippus
but
justus
lipsius
observed
in
his
that
the
passage
from
cicero
was
mutilated
and
that
aulus
gellius
has
preserved
for
us
the
whole
argument
of
the
stoic
philosopher
lib
here
it
is
in
epitome
fate
is
the
inevitable
and
eternal
connexion
of
all
events
against
this
is
urged
in
objection
that
it
follows
that
the
acts
of
the
will
would
be
necessary
and
that
criminals
being
coerced
into
evil
should
not
be
punished
chrysippus
answers
that
evil
springs
from
the
original
constitution
of
souls
which
forms
part
of
the
destined
sequence
that
souls
which
are
of
a
good
natural
disposition
offer
stronger
resistance
to
the
impressions
of
external
causes
but
that
those
whose
natural
defects
had
not
been
corrected
by
discipline
allowed
themselves
to
be
perverted
next
he
distinguishes
according
to
cicero
between
principal
causes
and
accessary
causes
and
uses
the
comparison
of
a
cylinder
whose
rotatory
force
and
speed
or
ease
in
motion
comes
chiefly
from
its
shape
whereas
it
would
be
retarded
by
any
roughness
in
formation
nevertheless
it
has
need
of
impulsion
even
as
the
soul
needs
to
be
acted
upon
by
the
objects
of
the
senses
and
receives
this
impression
according
to
its
own
constitution
cicero
considers
that
chrysippus
becomes
so
confused
that
whether
he
will
or
no
he
confirms
the
necessity
of
fate
bayle
is
almost
of
the
same
opinion
art
lit
h
he
says
that
this
philosopher
does
not
get
out
of
the
bog
since
the
cylinder
is
regular
or
uneven
according
to
what
the
craftsman
has
made
it
and
thus
god
providence
fate
will
be
the
causes
of
evil
in
such
a
way
as
to
render
it
necessary
justus
lipsius
answers
that
according
to
the
stoics
evil
came
from
matter
that
is
to
my
mind
as
if
he
had
said
that
the
stone
on
which
the
craftsman
worked
was
sometimes
too
rough
and
too
irregular
to
produce
a
good
cylinder
bayle
cites
against
chrysippus
the
fragments
of
onomaus
and
diogenianus
that
eusebius
has
preserved
for
us
in
the
lib
and
above
all
he
relies
upon
refutation
in
his
book
against
the
stoics
quoted
art
lit
but
this
refutation
does
not
amount
to
very
much
plutarch
maintains
that
it
would
be
better
to
deny
power
to
god
than
to
impute
to
him
the
permission
of
evils
and
he
will
not
admit
that
evil
may
serve
a
greater
good
i
have
already
shown
on
the
contrary
that
god
can
not
but
be
even
though
he
can
do
no
better
than
produce
the
best
which
includes
the
permission
of
evil
moreover
i
have
pointed
out
repeatedly
that
what
is
to
the
disadvantage
of
a
part
taken
separately
may
serve
the
perfection
of
the
whole
chrysippus
had
already
made
an
observation
to
this
effect
not
only
in
his
fourth
book
on
providence
as
given
by
aulus
gellius
lib
where
he
asserts
that
evil
serves
to
bring
the
good
to
notice
a
reason
which
is
not
sufficient
here
but
still
better
when
he
applies
the
comparison
of
a
stage
play
in
his
second
book
on
nature
as
plutarch
quotes
it
himself
there
he
says
that
there
are
sometimes
portions
in
a
comedy
which
are
of
no
worth
in
themselves
and
which
nevertheless
lend
grace
to
the
whole
poem
he
calls
these
portions
epigrams
or
inscriptions
we
have
not
enough
acquaintance
with
the
nature
of
the
ancient
comedy
for
full
understanding
of
this
passage
from
chrysippus
but
since
plutarch
assents
to
the
fact
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
this
comparison
was
not
a
poor
one
plutarch
replies
in
the
first
place
that
the
world
is
not
like
a
play
to
provide
entertainment
but
that
is
a
poor
answer
the
comparison
lies
in
this
point
alone
that
one
bad
part
may
make
the
whole
better
he
replies
secondly
that
this
bad
passage
is
only
a
small
part
of
the
comedy
whereas
human
life
swarms
with
evils
this
reply
is
of
no
value
either
for
he
ought
to
have
taken
into
account
that
what
we
know
is
also
a
very
small
part
of
the
universe
but
let
us
return
to
the
cylinder
of
chrysippus
he
is
right
in
saying
that
vice
springs
from
the
original
constitution
of
some
minds
he
was
met
with
the
objection
that
god
formed
them
and
he
could
only
reply
by
pointing
to
the
imperfection
of
matter
which
did
not
permit
god
to
do
better
this
reply
is
of
no
value
for
matter
in
itself
is
indifferent
to
all
forms
and
god
made
it
evil
springs
rather
from
the
themselves
in
their
detached
state
that
is
from
the
ideas
that
god
has
not
produced
by
an
act
of
his
will
any
more
than
he
thus
produced
numbers
and
figures
and
all
possible
essences
which
one
must
regard
as
eternal
and
necessary
for
they
are
in
the
ideal
region
of
the
possibles
that
is
in
the
divine
understanding
god
is
therefore
not
the
author
of
essences
in
so
far
as
they
are
only
possibilities
but
there
is
nothing
actual
to
which
he
has
not
decreed
and
given
existence
and
he
has
permitted
evil
because
it
is
involved
in
the
best
plan
existing
in
the
region
of
possibles
a
plan
which
supreme
wisdom
could
not
fail
to
choose
this
notion
satisfies
at
once
the
wisdom
the
power
and
the
goodness
of
god
and
yet
leaves
a
way
open
for
the
entrance
of
evil
god
gives
perfection
to
creatures
in
so
far
as
it
is
possible
in
the
universe
one
gives
a
turn
to
the
cylinder
but
any
roughness
in
its
shape
restricts
the
swiftness
of
its
motion
this
comparison
made
by
chrysippus
does
not
greatly
differ
from
mine
which
was
taken
from
a
laden
boat
that
is
carried
along
by
the
river
current
its
pace
becoming
slower
as
the
load
grows
heavier
these
comparisons
tend
towards
the
same
end
and
that
shows
that
if
we
were
sufficiently
informed
concerning
the
opinions
of
ancient
philosophers
we
should
find
therein
more
reason
than
is
supposed
bayle
himself
commends
the
passage
from
chrysippus
art
lit
t
that
aulus
gellius
quotes
in
the
same
place
where
this
philosopher
maintains
that
evil
has
come
that
also
is
made
clear
by
my
system
for
i
have
demonstrated
that
the
evil
which
god
permitted
was
not
an
object
of
his
will
as
an
end
or
a
means
but
simply
as
a
condition
since
it
had
to
be
involved
in
the
best
yet
one
must
confess
that
the
cylinder
of
chrysippus
does
not
answer
the
objection
of
necessity
he
ought
to
have
added
in
the
first
place
that
it
is
by
the
free
choice
of
god
that
some
of
the
possibles
exist
secondly
that
rational
creatures
act
freely
also
in
accordance
with
their
original
nature
which
existed
already
in
the
eternal
ideas
and
lastly
that
the
motive
power
of
good
inclines
the
will
without
compelling
it
the
advantage
of
freedom
which
is
in
the
creature
without
doubt
exists
to
an
eminent
degree
in
god
that
must
be
understood
in
so
far
as
it
is
genuinely
an
advantage
and
in
so
far
as
it
presupposes
no
imperfection
for
to
be
able
to
make
a
mistake
and
go
astray
is
a
disadvantage
and
to
have
control
over
the
passions
is
in
truth
an
advantage
but
one
that
presupposes
an
imperfection
namely
passion
itself
of
which
god
is
incapable
scotus
was
justified
in
saying
that
if
god
were
not
free
and
exempt
from
necessity
no
creature
would
be
so
but
god
is
incapable
of
being
indeterminate
in
anything
whatsoever
he
can
not
be
ignorant
he
can
not
doubt
he
can
not
suspend
his
judgement
his
will
is
always
decided
and
it
can
only
be
decided
by
the
best
god
can
never
have
a
primitive
particular
will
that
is
independent
of
laws
or
general
acts
of
will
such
a
thing
would
be
unreasonable
he
can
not
determine
upon
adam
peter
judas
or
any
individual
without
the
existence
of
a
reason
for
this
determination
and
this
reason
leads
of
necessity
to
some
general
enunciation
the
wise
mind
always
acts
to
always
to
and
never
to
save
when
the
rules
come
into
collision
through
opposing
tendencies
where
the
strongest
carries
the
day
or
else
either
they
will
stop
one
another
or
some
third
course
will
emerge
as
a
result
in
all
these
cases
one
rule
serves
as
an
exception
to
the
other
and
there
are
never
any
with
one
who
always
acts
in
a
regular
way
if
there
are
people
who
believe
that
election
and
reprobation
are
accomplished
on
god
part
by
a
despotic
absolute
power
not
only
without
any
apparent
reason
but
actually
without
any
reason
even
a
concealed
one
they
maintain
an
opinion
that
destroys
alike
the
nature
of
things
and
the
divine
perfections
such
an
absolute
so
to
speak
would
be
without
doubt
insupportable
but
luther
and
calvin
were
far
from
such
a
belief
the
former
hopes
that
the
life
to
come
will
make
us
comprehend
the
just
reasons
of
god
choice
and
the
latter
protests
explicitly
that
these
reasons
are
just
and
holy
although
they
be
unknown
to
us
i
have
already
in
that
connexion
quoted
calvin
treatise
on
predestination
and
here
are
the
actual
words
before
the
fall
of
adam
had
reflected
upon
what
he
had
to
do
and
that
for
causes
concealed
from
us
it
is
evident
therefore
that
he
had
just
causes
for
the
reprobation
of
some
of
mankind
but
causes
to
us
unknown
this
truth
that
all
god
does
is
reasonable
and
can
not
be
better
done
strikes
at
the
outset
every
man
of
good
sense
and
extorts
so
to
speak
his
approbation
and
yet
the
most
subtle
of
philosophers
have
a
fatal
propensity
for
offending
sometimes
without
observing
it
during
the
course
and
in
the
heat
of
disputes
against
the
first
principles
of
good
sense
when
these
are
shrouded
in
terms
that
disguise
them
we
have
here
already
seen
how
the
excellent
bayle
with
all
his
shrewdness
has
nevertheless
combated
this
principle
which
i
have
just
indicated
and
which
is
a
sure
consequence
of
the
supreme
perfection
of
god
he
thought
to
defend
in
that
way
the
cause
of
god
and
to
exempt
him
from
an
imaginary
necessity
by
leaving
him
the
freedom
to
choose
from
among
various
goods
the
least
i
have
already
spoken
of
diroys
and
others
who
have
also
been
deluded
by
this
strange
opinion
one
that
is
far
too
commonly
accepted
those
who
uphold
it
do
not
observe
that
it
implies
a
wish
to
preserve
for
or
rather
bestow
upon
god
a
false
freedom
which
is
the
freedom
to
act
unreasonably
that
is
rendering
his
works
subject
to
correction
and
making
it
impossible
for
us
to
say
or
even
to
hope
that
anything
reasonable
can
be
said
upon
the
permission
of
evil
this
error
has
much
impaired
bayle
arguments
and
has
barred
his
way
of
escape
from
many
perplexities
that
appears
again
in
relation
to
the
laws
of
the
realm
of
nature
he
believes
them
to
be
arbitrary
and
indifferent
and
he
objects
that
god
could
better
have
attained
his
end
in
the
realm
of
grace
if
he
had
not
clung
to
these
laws
if
he
had
more
often
dispensed
with
their
observance
or
even
if
he
had
made
others
he
believed
this
especially
with
regard
to
the
law
of
the
union
between
the
soul
and
the
body
for
he
is
persuaded
with
the
modern
cartesians
that
the
ideas
of
the
perceptible
qualities
that
god
gives
according
to
them
to
the
soul
occasioned
by
movements
of
the
body
have
nothing
representing
these
movements
or
resembling
them
accordingly
it
was
a
purely
arbitrary
act
on
god
part
to
give
us
the
ideas
of
heat
cold
light
and
other
qualities
which
we
experience
rather
than
to
give
us
quite
different
ideas
occasioned
in
the
same
way
i
have
often
wondered
that
people
so
talented
should
have
been
capable
of
relishing
notions
so
unphilosophic
and
so
contrary
to
the
fundamental
maxims
of
reason
for
nothing
gives
clearer
indication
of
the
imperfection
of
a
philosophy
than
the
necessity
experienced
by
the
philosopher
to
confess
that
something
comes
to
pass
in
accordance
with
his
system
for
which
there
is
no
reason
that
applies
to
the
idea
of
epicurus
on
the
deviation
of
atoms
whether
it
be
god
or
nature
that
operates
the
operation
will
always
have
its
reasons
in
the
operations
of
nature
these
reasons
will
depend
either
upon
necessary
truths
or
upon
the
laws
that
god
has
found
the
most
reasonable
and
in
the
operations
of
god
they
will
depend
upon
the
choice
of
the
supreme
reason
which
causes
them
to
act
regis
a
famous
cartesian
had
asserted
in
his
part
book
that
the
faculties
god
has
given
to
men
are
the
most
excellent
that
they
were
capable
of
in
conformity
with
the
general
order
of
nature
only
he
says
power
of
god
and
the
nature
of
man
by
themselves
it
is
very
easy
to
conceive
that
god
could
have
made
man
more
perfect
but
if
one
will
consider
man
not
in
himself
and
separately
from
all
other
creatures
but
as
a
member
of
the
universe
and
a
portion
which
is
subject
to
the
general
laws
of
motions
one
will
be
bound
to
acknowledge
that
man
is
as
perfect
as
he
could
have
been
he
adds
we
can
not
conceive
that
god
could
have
employed
any
other
means
more
appropriate
than
pain
for
the
conservation
of
our
bodies
regis
is
right
in
a
general
way
in
saying
that
god
can
not
do
better
than
he
has
done
in
relation
to
all
and
although
there
be
apparently
in
some
places
in
the
universe
rational
animals
more
perfect
than
man
one
may
say
that
god
was
right
to
create
every
kind
of
species
some
more
perfect
than
others
it
is
perhaps
not
impossible
that
there
be
somewhere
a
species
of
animals
much
resembling
man
and
more
perfect
than
we
are
it
may
be
even
that
the
human
race
will
attain
in
time
to
a
greater
perfection
than
that
which
we
can
now
envisage
thus
the
laws
of
motions
do
not
prevent
man
from
being
more
perfect
but
the
place
god
has
assigned
to
man
in
space
and
in
time
limits
the
perfections
he
was
able
to
receive
i
also
doubt
with
bayle
whether
pain
be
necessary
in
order
to
warn
men
of
peril
but
this
writer
goes
too
far
to
the
questions
of
a
vol
ii
ch
he
seems
to
think
that
a
feeling
of
pleasure
could
have
the
same
effect
and
that
in
order
to
prevent
a
child
from
going
too
near
the
fire
god
could
give
him
ideas
of
pleasure
in
proportion
to
the
distance
he
kept
from
it
this
expedient
does
not
appear
very
practicable
with
regard
to
all
evils
unless
a
miracle
were
involved
it
is
more
natural
that
what
if
it
were
too
near
would
cause
an
evil
should
cause
some
foreboding
of
evil
when
it
is
a
little
less
near
yet
i
admit
that
it
is
possible
such
a
foreboding
will
be
something
less
than
pain
and
usually
this
is
the
case
thus
it
indeed
appears
that
pain
is
not
necessary
for
causing
one
to
shun
present
peril
it
is
wont
rather
to
serve
as
a
penalty
for
having
actually
plunged
into
evil
and
a
warning
against
further
lapse
there
are
also
many
painful
evils
the
avoidance
whereof
rests
not
with
us
as
a
dissolution
of
the
continuity
of
our
body
is
a
consequence
of
many
accidents
that
may
happen
to
us
it
was
natural
that
this
imperfection
of
the
body
should
be
represented
by
some
sense
of
imperfection
in
the
soul
nevertheless
i
would
not
guarantee
that
there
were
no
animals
in
the
universe
whose
structure
was
cunning
enough
to
cause
a
sense
of
indifference
as
accompaniment
to
this
dissolution
of
continuity
as
for
instance
when
a
gangrenous
limb
is
cut
off
or
even
a
sense
of
pleasure
as
if
one
were
only
scratching
oneself
for
the
imperfection
that
attends
the
dissolution
of
the
body
might
lead
to
the
sense
of
a
greater
perfection
which
was
suspended
or
checked
by
the
continuity
which
is
now
broken
and
in
this
respect
the
body
would
be
as
it
were
a
prison
there
is
also
nothing
to
preclude
the
existence
in
the
universe
of
animals
resembling
that
one
which
cyrano
de
bergerac
encountered
in
the
sun
the
body
of
this
animal
being
a
sort
of
fluid
composed
of
innumerable
small
animals
that
were
capable
of
ranging
themselves
in
accordance
with
the
desires
of
the
great
animal
by
this
means
it
transformed
itself
in
a
moment
just
as
it
pleased
and
the
dissolution
of
continuity
caused
it
no
more
hurt
than
the
stroke
of
an
oar
can
cause
to
the
sea
but
after
all
these
animals
are
not
men
they
are
not
in
our
globe
or
in
our
present
century
and
god
plan
ensured
that
there
should
not
be
lacking
here
on
earth
a
rational
animal
clothed
in
flesh
and
bones
whose
structure
involves
susceptibility
to
pain
but
bayle
further
opposes
this
on
another
principle
one
which
i
have
already
mentioned
it
seems
that
he
thinks
the
ideas
which
the
soul
conceives
in
relation
to
the
feelings
of
the
body
are
arbitrary
thus
god
might
have
caused
the
dissolution
of
continuity
to
give
us
pleasure
he
even
maintains
that
the
laws
of
motion
are
entirely
arbitrary
would
wish
to
know
he
says
vol
iii
ch
god
established
by
an
act
of
his
freedom
of
indifference
general
laws
on
the
communication
of
movements
and
the
particular
laws
on
the
union
of
the
human
soul
with
an
organic
body
in
this
case
he
could
have
established
quite
different
laws
and
adopted
a
system
whose
results
involved
neither
moral
evil
nor
physical
evil
but
if
the
answer
is
given
that
god
was
constrained
by
supreme
wisdom
to
establish
the
laws
that
he
has
established
there
we
have
neither
more
nor
less
than
the
of
the
stoics
wisdom
will
have
marked
out
a
way
for
god
the
abandonment
whereof
will
have
been
as
impossible
to
him
as
his
own
this
objection
has
been
sufficiently
overthrown
it
is
only
a
moral
necessity
and
it
is
always
a
happy
necessity
to
be
bound
to
act
in
accordance
with
the
rules
of
perfect
wisdom
moreover
it
appears
to
me
that
the
reason
for
the
belief
held
by
many
that
the
laws
of
motion
are
arbitrary
comes
from
the
fact
that
few
people
have
properly
examined
them
it
is
known
now
that
descartes
was
much
mistaken
in
his
statement
of
them
i
have
proved
conclusively
that
conservation
of
the
same
quantity
of
motion
can
not
occur
but
i
consider
that
the
same
quantity
of
force
is
conserved
whether
absolute
or
directive
and
respective
whether
total
or
partial
my
principles
which
carry
this
subject
as
far
as
it
can
go
have
not
yet
been
published
in
full
but
i
have
communicated
them
to
friends
competent
to
judge
of
them
who
have
approved
them
and
have
converted
some
other
persons
of
acknowledged
erudition
and
ability
i
discovered
at
the
same
time
that
the
laws
of
motion
actually
existing
in
nature
and
confirmed
by
experiments
are
not
in
reality
absolutely
demonstrable
as
a
geometrical
proposition
would
be
but
neither
is
it
necessary
that
they
be
so
they
do
not
spring
entirely
from
the
principle
of
necessity
but
rather
from
the
principle
of
perfection
and
order
they
are
an
effect
of
the
choice
and
the
wisdom
of
god
i
can
demonstrate
these
laws
in
divers
ways
but
must
always
assume
something
that
is
not
of
an
absolutely
geometrical
necessity
thus
these
admirable
laws
are
wonderful
evidence
of
an
intelligent
and
free
being
as
opposed
to
the
system
of
absolute
and
brute
necessity
advocated
by
strato
or
spinoza
i
have
found
that
one
may
account
for
these
laws
by
assuming
that
the
effect
is
always
equal
in
force
to
its
cause
or
which
amounts
to
the
same
thing
that
the
same
force
is
conserved
always
but
this
axiom
of
higher
philosophy
can
not
be
demonstrated
geometrically
one
may
again
apply
other
principles
of
like
nature
for
instance
the
principle
that
action
is
always
equal
to
reaction
one
which
assumes
in
things
a
distaste
for
external
change
and
can
not
be
derived
either
from
extension
or
impenetrability
and
that
other
principle
that
a
simple
movement
has
the
same
properties
as
those
which
might
belong
to
a
compound
movement
such
as
would
produce
the
same
phenomena
of
locomotion
these
assumptions
are
very
plausible
and
are
successful
as
an
explanation
of
the
laws
of
motion
nothing
is
so
appropriate
all
the
more
since
they
are
in
accord
with
each
other
but
there
is
to
be
found
in
them
no
absolute
necessity
such
as
may
compel
us
to
admit
them
in
the
way
one
is
compelled
to
admit
the
rules
of
logic
of
arithmetic
and
geometry
it
seems
when
one
considers
the
indifference
of
matter
to
motion
and
to
rest
that
the
largest
body
at
rest
could
be
carried
along
without
any
resistance
by
the
smallest
body
in
motion
in
which
case
there
would
be
action
without
reaction
and
an
effect
greater
than
its
cause
there
is
also
no
necessity
to
say
of
the
motion
of
a
ball
which
runs
freely
on
an
even
horizontal
plane
with
a
certain
degree
of
speed
termed
a
that
this
motion
must
have
the
properties
of
that
motion
which
it
would
have
if
it
were
going
with
lesser
speed
in
a
boat
itself
moving
in
the
same
direction
with
the
residue
of
the
speed
to
ensure
that
the
ball
seen
from
the
bank
advance
with
the
same
degree
a
for
although
the
same
appearance
of
speed
and
of
direction
results
through
this
medium
of
the
boat
it
is
not
because
it
is
the
same
thing
nevertheless
it
happens
that
the
effects
of
the
collision
of
the
balls
in
the
boat
the
motion
in
each
one
separately
combined
with
that
of
the
boat
giving
the
appearance
of
that
which
goes
on
outside
the
boat
also
give
the
appearance
of
the
effects
that
these
same
balls
colliding
would
have
outside
the
boat
all
that
is
admirable
but
one
does
not
see
its
absolute
necessity
a
movement
on
the
two
sides
of
the
triangle
composes
a
movement
on
the
hypotenuse
but
it
does
not
follow
that
a
ball
moving
on
the
hypotenuse
must
produce
the
effect
of
two
balls
of
its
own
size
moving
on
the
two
sides
yet
that
is
true
nothing
is
so
appropriate
as
this
result
and
god
has
chosen
the
laws
that
produce
it
but
one
sees
no
geometrical
necessity
therein
yet
it
is
this
very
lack
of
necessity
which
enhances
the
beauty
of
the
laws
that
god
has
chosen
wherein
divers
admirable
axioms
exist
in
conjunction
and
it
is
impossible
for
one
to
say
which
of
them
is
the
primary
i
have
also
shown
that
therein
is
observed
that
excellent
law
of
continuity
which
i
have
perhaps
been
the
first
to
state
and
which
is
a
kind
of
touchstone
whose
test
the
rules
of
descartes
of
father
fabry
father
pardies
father
de
malebranche
and
others
can
not
pass
in
virtue
of
this
law
one
must
be
able
to
regard
rest
as
a
movement
vanishing
after
having
continually
diminished
and
likewise
equality
as
an
inequality
that
vanishes
also
as
would
happen
through
the
continual
diminution
of
the
greater
of
two
unequal
bodies
while
the
smaller
retains
its
size
as
a
consequence
of
this
consideration
the
general
rule
for
unequal
bodies
or
bodies
in
motion
must
apply
also
to
equal
bodies
or
to
bodies
one
of
which
is
at
rest
as
to
a
particular
case
of
the
rule
this
does
result
in
the
true
laws
of
motion
and
does
not
result
in
certain
laws
invented
by
descartes
and
by
some
other
men
of
talent
which
already
on
that
score
alone
prove
to
be
so
that
one
may
predict
that
experiment
will
not
favour
them
these
considerations
make
it
plain
that
the
laws
of
nature
regulating
movements
are
neither
entirely
necessary
nor
entirely
arbitrary
the
middle
course
to
be
taken
is
that
they
are
a
choice
of
the
most
perfect
wisdom
and
this
great
example
of
the
laws
of
motion
shows
with
the
utmost
clarity
how
much
difference
there
is
between
these
three
cases
to
wit
firstly
absolute
metaphysical
or
geometrical
which
may
be
called
blind
and
which
does
not
depend
upon
any
but
efficient
causes
in
the
second
place
moral
which
comes
from
the
free
choice
of
wisdom
in
relation
to
final
causes
and
finally
in
the
third
place
absolutely
depending
upon
an
indifference
of
equipoise
which
is
imagined
but
which
can
not
exist
where
there
is
no
sufficient
reason
either
in
the
efficient
or
in
the
final
cause
consequently
one
must
conclude
how
mistaken
it
is
to
confuse
either
that
which
is
absolutely
necessary
with
that
which
is
determined
by
the
reason
of
the
best
or
the
freedom
that
is
determined
by
reason
with
a
vague
indifference
this
also
settles
bayle
difficulty
for
he
fears
that
if
god
is
always
determinate
nature
could
dispense
with
him
and
bring
about
that
same
effect
which
is
attributed
to
him
through
the
necessity
of
the
order
of
things
that
would
be
true
if
the
laws
of
motion
for
instance
and
all
the
rest
had
their
source
in
a
geometrical
necessity
of
efficient
causes
but
in
the
last
analysis
one
is
obliged
to
resort
to
something
depending
upon
final
causes
and
upon
what
is
fitting
this
also
utterly
destroys
the
most
plausible
reasoning
of
the
naturalists
johann
joachim
becher
a
german
physician
well
known
for
his
books
on
chemistry
had
composed
a
prayer
which
looked
like
getting
him
into
trouble
it
began
sancta
mater
natura
aeterne
rerum
ordo
and
it
ended
by
saying
that
this
nature
must
forgive
him
his
errors
since
she
herself
was
their
cause
but
the
nature
of
things
if
taken
as
without
intelligence
and
without
choice
has
in
it
nothing
sufficiently
determinant
herr
becher
did
not
sufficiently
take
into
account
that
the
author
of
things
must
be
good
and
wise
and
that
we
can
be
evil
without
complicity
on
his
part
in
our
acts
of
wickedness
when
a
wicked
man
exists
god
must
have
found
in
the
region
of
possibles
the
idea
of
such
a
man
forming
part
of
that
sequence
of
things
the
choice
of
which
was
demanded
by
the
greatest
perfection
of
the
universe
and
in
which
errors
and
sins
are
not
only
punished
but
even
repaired
to
greater
advantage
so
that
they
contribute
to
the
greatest
good
bayle
however
has
extended
the
free
choice
of
god
a
little
too
far
speaking
of
the
peripatetic
strato
to
the
questions
of
a
vol
iii
ch
who
asserted
that
everything
had
been
brought
forth
by
the
necessity
of
a
nature
devoid
of
intelligence
he
maintains
that
this
philosopher
on
being
asked
why
a
tree
has
not
the
power
to
form
bones
and
veins
might
have
asked
in
his
turn
why
has
matter
precisely
three
dimensions
why
should
not
two
have
sufficed
for
it
why
has
it
not
four
one
had
answered
that
there
can
be
neither
more
nor
less
than
three
dimensions
he
would
have
demanded
the
cause
of
this
impossibility
these
words
lead
one
to
believe
that
bayle
suspected
that
the
number
of
the
dimensions
of
matter
depended
upon
god
choice
even
as
it
depended
upon
him
to
cause
or
not
to
cause
trees
to
produce
animals
indeed
how
do
we
know
whether
there
are
not
planetary
globes
or
earths
situated
in
some
more
remote
place
in
the
universe
where
the
fable
of
the
of
scotland
birds
that
were
said
to
be
born
of
trees
proves
true
and
even
whether
there
are
not
countries
where
one
could
say
populos
umbrosa
et
foeta
viridis
puer
excidit
alno
but
with
the
dimensions
of
matter
it
is
not
thus
the
ternary
number
is
determined
for
it
not
by
the
reason
of
the
best
but
by
a
geometrical
necessity
because
the
geometricians
have
been
able
to
prove
that
there
are
only
three
straight
lines
perpendicular
to
one
another
which
can
intersect
at
one
and
the
same
point
nothing
more
appropriate
could
have
been
chosen
to
show
the
difference
there
is
between
the
moral
necessity
that
accounts
for
the
choice
of
wisdom
and
the
brute
necessity
of
strato
and
the
adherents
of
spinoza
who
deny
to
god
understanding
and
will
than
a
consideration
of
the
difference
existing
between
the
reason
for
the
laws
of
motion
and
the
reason
for
the
ternary
number
of
the
dimensions
for
the
first
lies
in
the
choice
of
the
best
and
the
second
in
a
geometrical
and
blind
necessity
having
spoken
of
the
laws
of
bodies
that
is
of
the
rules
of
motion
let
us
come
to
the
laws
of
the
union
between
body
and
soul
where
bayle
believes
that
he
finds
again
some
vague
indifference
something
absolutely
arbitrary
here
is
the
way
he
speaks
of
it
in
his
vol
ii
ch
is
a
puzzling
question
whether
bodies
have
some
natural
property
of
doing
harm
or
good
to
man
soul
if
one
answers
yes
one
plunges
into
an
insane
labyrinth
for
as
man
soul
is
an
immaterial
substance
one
will
be
bound
to
say
that
the
local
movement
of
certain
bodies
is
an
efficient
cause
of
the
thoughts
in
a
mind
a
statement
contrary
to
the
most
obvious
notions
that
philosophy
imparts
to
us
if
one
answers
no
one
will
be
constrained
to
admit
that
the
influence
of
our
organs
upon
our
thoughts
depends
neither
upon
the
internal
qualities
of
matter
nor
upon
the
laws
of
motion
but
upon
an
of
the
creator
one
must
then
admit
that
it
depended
altogether
upon
freedom
to
combine
particular
thoughts
of
our
soul
with
particular
modifications
of
our
body
even
when
he
had
once
established
all
the
laws
for
the
action
of
bodies
one
upon
another
whence
it
results
that
there
is
in
the
universe
no
portion
of
matter
which
by
its
proximity
can
harm
us
save
when
god
wills
it
and
consequently
that
the
earth
is
as
capable
as
any
other
place
of
being
the
abode
of
the
happy
man
in
short
it
is
evident
that
there
is
no
need
in
order
to
prevent
the
wrong
choices
of
freedom
to
transport
man
outside
the
earth
god
could
do
on
earth
with
regard
to
all
the
acts
of
the
will
what
he
does
in
respect
of
the
good
works
of
the
predestined
when
he
settles
their
outcome
whether
by
efficacious
or
by
sufficient
grace
and
that
grace
without
in
any
way
impairing
freedom
is
always
followed
by
the
assent
of
the
soul
it
would
be
as
easy
for
him
on
earth
as
in
heaven
to
bring
about
the
determination
of
our
souls
to
a
good
choice
i
agree
with
bayle
that
god
could
have
so
ordered
bodies
and
souls
on
this
globe
of
earth
whether
by
ways
of
nature
or
by
extraordinary
graces
that
it
would
have
been
a
perpetual
paradise
and
a
foretaste
of
the
celestial
state
of
the
blessed
there
is
no
reason
why
there
should
not
be
worlds
happier
than
ours
but
god
had
good
reasons
for
willing
that
ours
should
be
such
as
it
is
nevertheless
in
order
to
prove
that
a
better
state
would
have
been
possible
here
bayle
had
no
need
to
resort
to
the
system
of
occasional
causes
it
abounds
in
miracles
and
in
hypotheses
for
which
their
very
originators
confess
there
is
no
justification
and
these
are
two
defects
such
as
will
most
of
all
estrange
a
system
from
true
philosophy
it
is
a
cause
for
surprise
in
the
first
place
that
bayle
did
not
bethink
himself
of
the
system
of
harmony
which
he
had
examined
before
and
which
for
this
matter
was
so
opportune
but
as
in
this
system
all
is
connected
and
harmonious
all
following
from
reasons
and
nothing
being
left
incomplete
or
exposed
to
the
rash
discretion
of
perfect
indifference
it
seems
that
it
was
not
pleasing
to
bayle
for
he
was
here
somewhat
biassed
in
favour
of
such
indifference
which
notwithstanding
he
contested
so
strongly
on
other
occasions
he
was
much
given
to
passing
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
not
with
an
ill
intention
or
against
his
own
conviction
but
because
there
was
as
yet
nothing
settled
in
his
mind
on
the
question
concerned
he
contented
himself
with
whatever
suited
him
for
frustrating
the
opponent
he
had
in
mind
his
aim
being
only
to
perplex
philosophers
and
show
the
weakness
of
our
reason
and
never
in
my
opinion
did
either
arcesilaus
or
carneades
argue
for
and
against
with
more
eloquence
and
more
wit
but
after
all
one
must
not
doubt
for
the
sake
of
doubting
doubts
must
serve
us
as
a
gangway
to
the
truth
that
is
what
i
often
said
to
the
late
abbé
foucher
a
few
specimens
of
whose
work
prove
that
he
designed
to
do
with
regard
to
the
academicians
what
lipsius
and
scioppius
had
done
for
the
stoics
and
gassendi
for
epicurus
and
what
dacier
has
so
well
begun
for
plato
it
must
not
be
possible
for
us
to
offer
true
philosophers
such
a
reproach
as
that
implied
in
the
celebrated
casaubon
answer
to
those
who
in
showing
him
the
hall
of
the
sorbonne
told
him
that
debate
had
been
carried
on
there
for
some
centuries
what
conclusions
have
been
reached
he
said
to
them
bayle
goes
on
is
true
that
since
the
laws
of
motion
were
instituted
in
such
forms
as
we
see
now
in
the
world
it
is
an
inevitable
necessity
that
a
hammer
striking
a
nut
should
break
it
and
that
a
stone
falling
on
a
man
foot
should
cause
some
bruise
or
some
derangement
of
its
parts
but
that
is
all
that
can
follow
the
action
of
this
stone
upon
the
human
body
if
you
want
it
in
addition
to
cause
a
feeling
of
pain
then
one
must
assume
the
institution
of
a
code
other
than
that
one
which
regulates
the
action
and
reaction
of
bodies
one
upon
another
one
must
i
say
have
recourse
to
the
particular
system
of
the
laws
of
union
between
the
soul
and
certain
bodies
now
as
this
system
is
not
of
necessity
connected
with
the
other
the
indifference
of
god
does
not
cease
in
relation
to
the
one
immediately
upon
his
choice
of
the
other
he
therefore
combined
these
two
systems
with
a
complete
freedom
like
two
things
which
did
not
follow
naturally
the
one
from
the
other
thus
it
is
by
an
arbitrary
institution
he
has
ordained
that
wounds
in
the
body
should
cause
pain
in
the
soul
which
is
united
to
this
body
it
therefore
only
rested
with
him
to
have
chosen
another
system
of
union
between
soul
and
body
he
was
therefore
able
to
choose
one
in
accordance
wherewith
wounds
only
evoke
the
idea
of
the
remedy
and
an
intense
but
agreeable
desire
to
apply
it
he
was
able
to
arrange
that
all
bodies
which
were
on
the
point
of
breaking
a
man
head
or
piercing
his
heart
should
evoke
a
lively
sense
of
danger
and
that
this
sense
should
cause
the
body
to
remove
itself
promptly
out
of
reach
of
the
blow
all
that
would
have
come
to
pass
without
miracles
since
there
would
have
been
general
laws
on
this
subject
the
system
which
we
know
by
experience
teaches
us
that
the
determination
of
the
movement
of
certain
bodies
changes
in
pursuance
of
our
desires
it
was
therefore
possible
for
a
combination
to
be
effected
between
our
desires
and
the
movement
of
certain
bodies
whereby
the
nutritive
juices
were
so
modified
that
the
good
arrangement
of
our
organs
was
never
affected
it
is
evident
that
bayle
believes
that
everything
accomplished
through
general
laws
is
accomplished
without
miracles
but
i
have
shown
sufficiently
that
if
the
law
is
not
founded
on
reasons
and
does
not
serve
to
explain
the
event
through
the
nature
of
things
it
can
only
be
put
into
execution
by
a
miracle
if
for
example
god
had
ordained
that
bodies
must
have
a
circular
motion
he
would
have
needed
perpetual
miracles
or
the
ministry
of
angels
to
put
this
order
into
execution
for
that
is
contrary
to
the
nature
of
motion
whereby
the
body
naturally
abandons
the
circular
line
to
continue
in
the
tangent
straight
line
if
nothing
holds
it
back
therefore
it
is
not
enough
for
god
to
ordain
simply
that
a
wound
should
excite
an
agreeable
sensation
natural
means
must
be
found
for
that
purpose
the
real
means
whereby
god
causes
the
soul
to
be
conscious
of
what
happens
in
the
body
have
their
origin
in
the
nature
of
the
soul
which
represents
the
bodies
and
is
so
made
beforehand
that
the
representations
which
are
to
spring
up
one
from
another
within
it
by
a
natural
sequence
of
thoughts
correspond
to
the
changes
in
the
body
the
representation
has
a
natural
relation
to
that
which
is
to
be
represented
if
god
should
have
the
round
shape
of
a
body
represented
by
the
idea
of
a
square
that
would
be
an
unsuitable
representation
for
there
would
be
angles
or
projections
in
the
representation
while
all
would
be
even
and
smooth
in
the
original
the
representation
often
suppresses
something
in
the
objects
when
it
is
imperfect
but
it
can
add
nothing
that
would
render
it
not
more
than
perfect
but
false
moreover
the
suppression
is
never
complete
in
our
perceptions
and
there
is
in
the
representation
confused
as
it
is
more
than
we
see
there
thus
there
is
reason
for
supposing
that
the
ideas
of
heat
cold
colours
also
only
represent
the
small
movements
carried
out
in
the
organs
when
one
is
conscious
of
these
qualities
although
the
multiplicity
and
the
diminutive
character
of
these
movements
prevents
their
clear
representation
almost
in
the
same
way
it
happens
that
we
do
not
distinguish
the
blue
and
the
yellow
which
play
their
part
in
the
representation
as
well
as
in
the
composition
of
the
green
when
the
microscope
shows
that
what
appears
to
be
green
is
composed
of
yellow
and
blue
parts
it
is
true
that
the
same
thing
may
be
represented
in
different
ways
but
there
must
always
be
an
exact
relation
between
the
representation
and
the
thing
and
consequently
between
the
different
representations
of
one
and
the
same
thing
the
projections
in
perspective
of
the
conic
sections
of
the
circle
show
that
one
and
the
same
circle
may
be
represented
by
an
ellipse
a
parabola
and
a
hyperbola
and
even
by
another
circle
a
straight
line
and
a
point
nothing
appears
so
different
nor
so
dissimilar
as
these
figures
and
yet
there
is
an
exact
relation
between
each
point
and
every
other
point
thus
one
must
allow
that
each
soul
represents
the
universe
to
itself
according
to
its
point
of
view
and
through
a
relation
which
is
peculiar
to
it
but
a
perfect
harmony
always
subsists
therein
god
if
he
wished
to
effect
representation
of
the
dissolution
of
continuity
of
the
body
by
an
agreeable
sensation
in
the
soul
would
not
have
neglected
to
ensure
that
this
very
dissolution
should
serve
some
perfection
in
the
body
by
giving
it
some
new
relief
as
when
one
is
freed
of
some
burden
or
loosed
from
some
bond
but
organic
bodies
of
such
kinds
although
possible
do
not
exist
upon
our
globe
which
doubtless
lacks
innumerable
inventions
that
god
may
have
put
to
use
elsewhere
nevertheless
it
is
enough
that
due
allowance
being
made
for
the
place
our
world
holds
in
the
universe
nothing
can
be
done
for
it
better
than
what
god
does
he
makes
the
best
possible
use
of
the
laws
of
nature
which
he
has
established
and
as
regis
also
acknowledged
in
the
same
passage
laws
that
god
has
established
in
nature
are
the
most
excellent
it
is
possible
to
conceive
i
will
add
to
that
the
remark
from
the
des
of
the
march
which
bayle
has
inserted
in
chapter
of
the
to
the
questions
of
a
vol
iii
the
matter
in
question
is
the
extract
from
a
very
ingenious
modern
book
on
the
origin
of
evil
to
which
i
have
already
referred
here
it
is
stated
the
general
solution
in
respect
of
physical
evil
which
this
book
gives
is
that
the
universe
must
be
regarded
as
a
work
composed
of
various
pieces
which
form
a
whole
that
according
to
the
laws
established
in
nature
some
parts
can
not
be
better
unless
others
become
worse
whence
would
result
a
system
less
perfect
as
a
whole
this
principle
the
writer
goes
on
good
but
if
nothing
is
added
to
it
it
does
not
appear
sufficient
why
has
god
established
laws
that
give
rise
to
so
many
difficulties
philosophers
who
are
somewhat
precise
will
say
could
he
not
have
established
others
of
a
kind
not
subject
to
any
defects
and
to
cut
the
matter
short
how
comes
it
that
he
has
prescribed
laws
for
himself
why
does
he
not
act
without
general
laws
in
accordance
with
all
his
power
and
all
his
goodness
the
writer
has
not
carried
the
difficulty
as
far
as
that
by
disentangling
his
ideas
one
might
indeed
possibly
find
means
of
solving
the
difficulty
but
there
is
no
development
of
the
subject
in
his
work
i
suppose
that
the
gifted
author
of
this
extract
when
he
thought
the
difficulty
could
be
solved
had
in
mind
something
akin
to
my
principles
on
this
matter
if
he
had
vouchsafed
to
declare
himself
in
this
passage
he
would
to
all
appearance
have
replied
like
regis
that
the
laws
god
established
were
the
most
excellent
that
could
be
established
he
would
have
acknowledged
at
the
same
time
that
god
could
not
have
refrained
from
establishing
laws
and
following
rules
because
laws
and
rules
are
what
makes
order
and
beauty
that
to
act
without
rules
would
be
to
act
without
reason
and
that
because
god
into
action
all
his
the
exercise
of
his
omnipotence
was
consistent
with
the
laws
of
wisdom
to
secure
as
much
good
as
was
possible
of
attainment
finally
he
would
have
said
the
existence
of
certain
particular
disadvantages
which
strike
us
is
a
sure
indication
that
the
best
plan
did
not
permit
of
their
avoidance
and
that
they
assist
in
the
achievement
of
the
total
good
an
argument
wherewith
bayle
in
more
than
one
place
expresses
agreement
now
that
i
have
proved
sufficiently
that
everything
comes
to
pass
according
to
determinate
reasons
there
can
not
be
any
more
difficulty
over
these
principles
of
god
foreknowledge
although
these
determinations
do
not
compel
they
can
not
but
be
certain
and
they
foreshadow
what
shall
happen
it
is
true
that
god
sees
all
at
once
the
whole
sequence
of
this
universe
when
he
chooses
it
and
that
thus
he
has
no
need
of
the
connexion
of
effects
and
causes
in
order
to
foresee
these
effects
but
since
his
wisdom
causes
him
to
choose
a
sequence
in
perfect
connexion
he
can
not
but
see
one
part
of
the
sequence
in
the
other
it
is
one
of
the
rules
of
my
system
of
general
harmony
the
present
is
big
with
the
and
that
he
who
sees
all
sees
in
that
which
is
that
which
shall
be
what
is
more
i
have
proved
conclusively
that
god
sees
in
each
portion
of
the
universe
the
whole
universe
owing
to
the
perfect
connexion
of
things
he
is
infinitely
more
discerning
than
pythagoras
who
judged
the
height
of
hercules
by
the
size
of
his
footprint
there
must
therefore
be
no
doubt
that
effects
follow
their
causes
determinately
in
spite
of
contingency
and
even
of
freedom
which
nevertheless
exist
together
with
certainty
or
determination
durand
de
among
others
has
indicated
this
clearly
in
saying
that
contingent
futurities
are
seen
determinately
in
their
causes
and
that
god
who
knows
all
seeing
all
that
shall
have
power
to
tempt
or
repel
the
will
will
see
therein
the
course
it
shall
take
i
could
cite
many
other
authors
who
have
said
the
same
thing
and
reason
does
not
allow
the
possibility
of
thinking
otherwise
jacquelot
implies
also
of
faith
with
as
bayle
observes
to
the
questions
of
a
vol
iii
ch
that
the
dispositions
of
the
human
heart
and
those
of
circumstances
acquaint
god
unerringly
with
the
choice
that
man
shall
make
bayle
adds
that
some
molinists
say
the
same
and
refers
us
to
those
who
are
quoted
in
the
of
pierre
de
joseph
the
feuillant
pp
those
who
have
confused
this
determination
with
necessity
have
fabricated
monsters
in
order
to
fight
them
to
avoid
a
reasonable
thing
which
they
had
disguised
under
a
hideous
shape
they
have
fallen
into
great
absurdities
for
fear
of
being
obliged
to
admit
an
imaginary
necessity
or
at
least
one
different
from
that
in
question
they
have
admitted
something
which
happens
without
the
existence
of
any
cause
or
reason
for
it
this
amounts
to
the
same
as
the
absurd
deviation
of
atoms
which
according
to
epicurus
happened
without
any
cause
cicero
in
his
book
on
divination
saw
clearly
that
if
the
cause
could
produce
an
effect
towards
which
it
was
entirely
indifferent
there
would
be
a
true
chance
a
genuine
luck
an
actual
fortuitous
case
that
is
one
which
would
be
so
not
merely
in
relation
to
us
and
our
ignorance
according
to
which
one
may
say
facimus
fortuna
deam
caeloque
locamus
but
even
in
relation
to
god
and
to
the
nature
of
things
consequently
it
would
be
impossible
to
foresee
events
by
judging
of
the
future
by
the
past
he
adds
fittingly
in
the
same
passage
potest
provideri
quicquam
futurum
esse
quod
neque
causam
habet
ullam
neque
notam
cur
futurum
sit
and
soon
after
est
tam
contrarium
rationi
et
constantiae
quam
fortuna
ut
mihi
ne
in
deum
quidem
cadere
videatur
ut
sciat
quid
casu
et
fortuito
futurum
sit
si
enim
scit
certe
illud
eveniet
sin
certe
eveniet
nulla
fortuna
est
if
the
future
is
certain
there
is
no
such
thing
as
luck
but
he
wrongly
adds
autum
fortuna
rerum
igitur
fortuitarum
nulla
praesensio
est
there
is
luck
therefore
future
events
can
not
be
foreseen
he
ought
rather
to
have
concluded
that
events
being
predetermined
and
foreseen
there
is
no
luck
but
he
was
then
speaking
against
the
stoics
in
the
character
of
an
academician
the
stoics
already
derived
from
the
decrees
of
god
the
prevision
of
events
for
as
cicero
says
in
the
same
book
porro
nihil
deos
ignorare
quod
omnia
ab
iis
sint
constituta
and
according
to
my
system
god
having
seen
the
possible
world
that
he
desired
to
create
foresaw
everything
therein
thus
one
may
say
that
the
knowledge
of
vision
differs
from
the
knowledge
of
simple
only
in
that
it
adds
to
the
latter
the
acquaintance
with
the
actual
decree
to
choose
this
sequence
of
things
which
simple
intelligence
had
already
presented
but
only
as
possible
and
this
decree
now
makes
the
present
universe
thus
the
socinians
can
not
be
excused
for
denying
to
god
the
certain
knowledge
of
future
events
and
above
all
of
the
future
resolves
of
a
free
creature
for
even
though
they
had
supposed
that
there
is
a
freedom
of
complete
indifference
so
that
the
will
can
choose
without
cause
and
that
thus
this
effect
could
not
be
seen
in
its
cause
which
is
a
great
absurdity
they
ought
always
to
take
into
account
that
god
was
able
to
foresee
this
event
in
the
idea
of
the
possible
world
that
he
resolved
to
create
but
the
idea
which
they
have
of
god
is
unworthy
of
the
author
of
things
and
is
not
commensurate
with
the
skill
and
wit
which
the
writers
of
this
party
often
display
in
certain
particular
discussions
the
author
of
the
on
the
picture
of
was
not
altogether
mistaken
in
saying
that
the
god
of
the
socinians
would
be
ignorant
and
powerless
like
the
god
of
epicurus
every
day
confounded
by
events
and
living
from
one
day
to
the
next
if
he
only
knows
by
conjecture
what
the
will
of
men
is
to
be
the
whole
difficulty
here
has
therefore
only
come
from
a
wrong
idea
of
contingency
and
of
freedom
which
was
thought
to
have
need
of
a
complete
indifference
or
equipoise
an
imaginary
thing
of
which
neither
a
notion
nor
an
example
exists
nor
ever
can
exist
apparently
descartes
had
been
imbued
with
the
idea
in
his
youth
at
the
college
of
la
flèche
that
caused
him
to
say
part
i
of
his
art
thought
is
finite
and
the
knowledge
and
omnipotence
of
god
whereby
he
has
not
only
known
from
all
eternity
everything
that
is
or
that
can
be
but
also
has
willed
it
is
infinite
thus
we
have
enough
intelligence
to
recognize
clearly
and
distinctly
that
this
power
and
this
knowledge
are
in
god
but
we
have
not
enough
so
to
comprehend
their
extent
that
we
can
know
how
they
leave
the
actions
of
men
entirely
free
and
indeterminate
the
continuation
has
already
been
quoted
above
free
that
is
right
but
one
spoils
everything
by
adding
indeterminate
one
has
no
need
of
infinite
knowledge
in
order
to
see
that
the
foreknowledge
and
the
providence
of
god
allow
freedom
to
our
actions
since
god
has
foreseen
those
actions
in
his
ideas
just
as
they
are
that
is
free
laurentius
valla
indeed
in
his
against
which
i
will
presently
quote
in
epitome
ably
undertakes
to
reconcile
freedom
with
foreknowledge
but
does
not
venture
to
hope
that
he
can
reconcile
it
with
providence
yet
there
is
no
more
difficulty
in
the
one
than
the
other
because
the
decree
to
give
existence
to
this
action
no
more
changes
its
nature
than
does
one
mere
consciousness
thereof
but
there
is
no
knowledge
however
infinite
it
be
which
can
reconcile
the
knowledge
and
providence
of
god
with
actions
of
an
indeterminate
cause
that
is
to
say
with
a
chimerical
and
impossible
being
the
actions
of
the
will
are
determined
in
two
ways
by
the
foreknowledge
or
providence
of
god
and
also
by
the
dispositions
of
the
particular
immediate
cause
which
lie
in
the
inclinations
of
the
soul
descartes
followed
the
thomists
on
this
point
but
he
wrote
with
his
usual
circumspection
so
as
not
to
come
into
conflict
with
some
other
theologians
bayle
relates
to
the
questions
of
a
vol
iii
ch
that
father
gibieuf
of
the
oratory
published
a
latin
treatise
on
the
freedom
of
god
and
of
the
creature
in
the
year
that
he
was
met
with
protests
and
was
shown
a
collection
of
seventy
contradictions
taken
from
the
first
book
of
his
work
and
that
twenty
years
after
father
annat
confessor
to
the
king
of
france
reproached
him
in
his
book
incoacta
ed
rome
in
for
the
silence
he
still
maintained
who
would
not
think
adds
bayle
after
the
uproar
of
the
congregations
that
the
thomists
taught
things
touching
the
nature
of
free
will
which
were
entirely
opposed
to
the
opinion
of
the
jesuits
when
however
one
considers
the
passages
that
father
annat
quoted
from
the
works
of
the
thomists
in
a
pamphlet
entitled
a
thomistis
gratiae
per
se
ipsam
efficacis
defensoribus
printed
in
paris
in
the
year
in
one
can
in
reality
only
see
verbal
controversies
between
the
two
sects
the
grace
efficacious
of
itself
according
to
the
one
side
leaves
to
free
will
quite
as
much
power
of
resistance
as
the
congruent
grace
of
the
others
bayle
thinks
one
can
say
almost
as
much
of
jansenius
himself
he
was
so
he
says
an
able
man
of
a
methodical
mind
and
of
great
assiduity
he
worked
for
years
at
his
one
of
his
aims
was
to
refute
the
jesuits
on
the
dogma
of
free
will
yet
no
decision
has
yet
been
reached
as
to
whether
he
rejects
or
adopts
freedom
of
indifference
from
his
work
innumerable
passages
are
quoted
for
and
against
this
opinion
as
father
annat
has
himself
shown
in
the
work
that
has
just
been
mentioned
incoacta
so
easy
is
it
to
render
this
subject
obscure
as
bayle
says
at
the
conclusion
of
this
discourse
as
for
father
gibieuf
it
must
be
admitted
that
he
often
alters
the
meaning
of
his
terms
and
that
consequently
he
does
not
answer
the
question
in
the
main
albeit
he
often
writes
with
good
sense
indeed
confusion
springs
more
often
than
not
from
ambiguity
in
terms
and
from
one
failure
to
take
trouble
over
gaining
clear
ideas
about
them
that
gives
rise
to
these
eternal
and
usually
mistaken
contentions
on
necessity
and
contingency
on
the
possible
and
the
impossible
but
provided
that
it
is
understood
that
necessity
and
possibility
taken
metaphysically
and
strictly
depend
solely
upon
this
question
whether
the
object
in
itself
or
that
which
is
opposed
to
it
implies
contradiction
or
not
and
that
one
takes
into
account
that
contingency
is
consistent
with
the
inclinations
or
reasons
which
contribute
towards
causing
determination
by
the
will
provided
also
that
one
knows
how
to
distinguish
clearly
between
necessity
and
determination
or
certainty
between
metaphysical
necessity
which
admits
of
no
choice
presenting
only
one
single
object
as
possible
and
moral
necessity
which
constrains
the
wisest
to
choose
the
best
finally
provided
that
one
is
rid
of
the
chimera
of
complete
indifference
which
can
only
be
found
in
the
books
of
philosophers
and
on
paper
for
they
can
not
even
conceive
the
notion
in
their
heads
or
prove
its
reality
by
an
example
in
things
one
will
easily
escape
from
a
labyrinth
whose
unhappy
daedalus
was
the
human
mind
that
labyrinth
has
caused
infinite
confusion
as
much
with
the
ancients
as
with
those
of
later
times
even
so
far
as
to
lead
men
into
the
absurd
error
of
the
lazy
sophism
which
closely
resembles
fate
after
the
turkish
fashion
i
do
not
wonder
if
in
reality
the
thomists
and
the
jesuits
and
even
the
molinists
and
the
jansenists
agree
together
on
this
matter
more
than
is
supposed
a
thomist
and
even
a
wise
jansenist
will
content
himself
with
certain
determination
without
going
on
to
necessity
and
if
someone
goes
so
far
the
error
mayhap
will
lie
only
in
the
word
a
wise
molinist
will
be
content
with
an
indifference
opposed
to
necessity
but
such
as
shall
not
exclude
prevalent
inclinations
these
difficulties
however
have
greatly
impressed
bayle
who
was
more
inclined
to
dwell
on
them
than
to
solve
them
although
he
might
perhaps
have
had
better
success
than
anyone
if
he
had
thought
fit
to
turn
his
mind
in
that
direction
here
is
what
he
says
of
them
in
his
art
lit
g
has
said
that
the
subject
of
grace
is
an
ocean
which
has
neither
shore
nor
bottom
perhaps
he
would
have
spoken
more
correctly
if
he
had
compared
it
to
the
strait
of
messina
where
one
is
always
in
danger
of
striking
one
reef
while
endeavouring
to
avoid
another
scylla
latus
laevum
implacata
everything
comes
back
in
the
end
to
this
did
adam
sin
freely
if
you
answer
yes
then
you
will
be
told
his
fall
was
not
foreseen
if
you
answer
no
then
you
will
be
told
he
is
not
guilty
you
may
write
a
hundred
volumes
against
the
one
or
the
other
of
these
conclusions
and
yet
you
will
confess
either
that
the
infallible
prevision
of
a
contingent
event
is
a
mystery
impossible
to
conceive
or
that
the
way
in
which
a
creature
which
acts
without
freedom
sins
nevertheless
is
altogether
incomprehensible
either
i
am
greatly
mistaken
or
these
two
alleged
incomprehensibilities
are
ended
altogether
by
my
solutions
would
to
god
it
were
as
easy
to
answer
the
question
how
to
cure
fevers
and
how
to
avoid
the
perils
of
two
chronic
sicknesses
that
may
originate
the
one
from
not
curing
the
fever
the
other
from
curing
it
wrongly
when
one
asserts
that
a
free
event
can
not
be
foreseen
one
is
confusing
freedom
with
indetermination
or
with
indifference
that
is
complete
and
in
equipoise
and
when
one
maintains
that
the
lack
of
freedom
would
prevent
man
from
being
guilty
one
means
a
freedom
exempt
not
from
determination
or
from
certainty
but
from
necessity
and
from
constraint
this
shows
that
the
dilemma
is
not
well
expressed
and
that
there
is
a
wide
passage
between
the
two
perilous
reefs
one
will
reply
therefore
that
adam
sinned
freely
and
that
god
saw
him
sinning
in
the
possible
state
of
adam
which
became
actual
in
accordance
with
the
decree
of
the
divine
permission
it
is
true
that
adam
was
determined
to
sin
in
consequence
of
certain
prevailing
inclinations
but
this
determination
destroys
neither
contingency
nor
freedom
moreover
the
certain
determination
to
sin
which
exists
in
man
does
not
deprive
him
of
the
power
to
avoid
sinning
speaking
generally
or
since
he
does
sin
prevent
him
from
being
guilty
and
deserving
punishment
this
is
more
especially
so
since
the
punishment
may
be
of
service
to
him
or
others
to
contribute
towards
determining
them
another
time
not
to
sin
there
is
besides
punitive
justice
which
goes
beyond
compensation
and
amendment
and
wherein
also
there
is
nothing
liable
to
be
shaken
by
the
certain
determination
of
the
contingent
resolutions
of
the
will
it
may
be
said
on
the
contrary
that
the
penalties
and
rewards
would
be
to
some
extent
unavailing
and
would
fail
in
one
of
their
aims
that
of
amendment
if
they
could
not
contribute
towards
determining
the
will
to
do
better
another
time
bayle
continues
freedom
is
concerned
there
are
only
two
courses
to
take
one
is
to
say
that
all
the
causes
distinct
from
the
soul
and
with
it
leave
it
the
power
to
act
or
not
to
act
the
other
is
to
say
that
they
so
determine
it
to
act
that
it
can
not
forbear
to
do
so
the
first
course
is
that
taken
by
the
molinists
the
other
is
that
of
the
thomists
and
jansenists
and
the
protestants
of
the
geneva
confession
yet
the
thomists
have
clamorously
maintained
that
they
were
not
jansenists
and
the
latter
have
maintained
with
equal
warmth
that
where
freedom
was
concerned
they
were
not
calvinists
on
the
other
hand
the
molinists
have
maintained
that
augustine
did
not
teach
jansenism
thus
the
one
side
not
wishing
to
admit
that
they
were
in
conformity
with
people
who
were
considered
heretics
and
the
other
side
not
wishing
to
admit
that
they
were
in
opposition
to
a
learned
saint
whose
opinions
were
always
considered
orthodox
have
both
performed
a
hundred
feats
of
contortion
etc
the
two
courses
which
bayle
distinguishes
here
do
not
exclude
a
third
course
according
to
which
the
determination
of
the
soul
does
not
come
solely
from
the
of
all
the
causes
distinct
from
the
soul
but
also
from
the
state
of
the
soul
itself
and
its
inclinations
which
mingle
with
the
impressions
of
the
senses
strengthening
or
weakening
them
now
all
the
internal
and
external
causes
taken
together
bring
it
about
that
the
soul
is
determined
certainly
but
not
of
necessity
for
no
contradiction
would
be
implied
if
the
soul
were
to
be
determined
differently
it
being
possible
for
the
will
to
be
inclined
but
not
possible
for
it
to
be
compelled
by
necessity
i
will
not
venture
upon
a
discussion
of
the
difference
existing
between
the
jansenists
and
the
reformed
on
this
matter
they
are
not
perhaps
always
fully
in
accord
with
themselves
as
regards
things
or
as
regards
expressions
on
a
matter
where
one
often
loses
one
way
in
bewildering
subtleties
father
theophile
raynaud
in
his
book
entitled
religio
wished
to
strike
at
the
dominicans
without
naming
them
on
the
other
hand
those
who
professed
to
be
followers
of
augustine
reproached
the
molinists
with
pelagianism
or
at
the
least
things
were
carried
to
excess
at
times
by
both
sides
whether
in
their
defence
of
a
vague
indifference
and
the
granting
of
too
much
to
man
or
in
their
teaching
ad
unum
secundum

that
is
to
say
a
determination
to
evil
in
the
as
if
they
did
nothing
but
sin
after
all
i
think
one
must
not
reproach
any
but
the
adherents
of
hobbes
and
spinoza
with
destroying
freedom
and
contingency
for
they
think
that
that
which
happens
is
alone
possible
and
must
happen
by
a
brute
geometrical
necessity
hobbes
made
everything
material
and
subjected
it
to
mathematical
laws

spinoza
also
divested

of
intelligence
and
choice
leaving
him
a
blind
power
whence
all
emanates

of
the
two
protestant
parties
are
equally
zealous
in
refuting
an
unendurable
necessity
although
those
who
follow
the
synod
of
dordrecht
teach
sometimes
that
it
suffices
for
freedom
to
be
exempt
from
constraint
it
seems
that
the
necessity
they
leave
in
it
is
only
hypothetical
or
rather
that
which
is
more
appropriately
termed
certainty
and
infallibility
thus
it
results
that
very
often
the
difficulties
only
lie
in
the
terms
i
say
as
much
with
regard
to
the
jansenists
although
i
do
not
wish
to
make
excuse
for
those
people
in
everything
with
the
hebrew
cabalists
or
the
kingdom
the
last
of
the
sephiroth
signified
that
god
controls
everything
irresistibly
but
gently
and
without
violence
so
that
man
thinks
he
is
following
his
own
will
while
he
carries
out
god
they
said
that
adam
sin
had
been
malcuth
a
caeteris
that
is
to
say
that
adam
had
cut
back
the
last
of
the
sephiroth
by
making
a
dominion
for
himself
within
god
dominion
and
by
assuming
for
himself
a
freedom
independent
of
god
but
that
his
fall
had
taught
him
that
he
could
not
subsist
of
himself
and
that
men
must
needs
be
redeemed
by
the
messiah
this
doctrine
may
receive
a
good
interpretation
but
spinoza
who
was
versed
in
the
cabala
of
the
writers
of
his
race
and
who
says
that
men
conceiving
of
freedom
as
they
do
establish
a
dominion
within
god
dominion
has
gone
too
far
the
dominion
of
god
is
with
spinoza
nothing
but
the
dominion
of
necessity
and
of
a
blind
necessity
as
with
strato
whereby
everything
emanates
from
the
divine
nature
while
no
choice
is
left
to
god
and
choice
does
not
exempt
him
from
necessity
he
adds
that
men
in
order
to
establish
what
is
termed
in
supposed
that
their
soul
was
a
direct
creation
of
god
something
which
could
not
be
produced
by
natural
causes
furthermore
that
it
had
an
absolute
power
of
determination
a
state
of
things
contrary
to
experience
spinoza
is
right
in
opposing
an
absolute
power
of
determination
that
is
one
without
any
grounds
it
does
not
belong
even
to
god
but
he
is
wrong
in
thinking
that
a
soul
that
a
simple
substance
can
be
produced
naturally
it
seems
indeed
that
the
soul
to
him
was
only
a
transient
modification
and
when
he
pretends
to
make
it
lasting
and
even
perpetual
he
substitutes
for
it
the
idea
of
the
body
which
is
purely
a
notion
and
not
a
real
and
actual
thing
the
story
bayle
relates
of
johan
bredenburg
a
citizen
of
rotterdam
art
lit
h
is
curious
he
published
a
book
against
spinoza
entitled
tractatus
una
cum
demonstratione
geometrico
ordine
disposita
naturam
non
esse
deum
cujus
effati
contrario
praedictus
tractatus
unice
one
was
surprised
to
see
that
a
man
who
did
not
follow
the
profession
of
letters
and
who
had
but
slight
education
having
written
his
book
in
flemish
and
had
it
translated
into
latin
had
been
able
to
penetrate
with
such
subtlety
all
the
principles
of
spinoza
and
succeed
in
overthrowing
them
after
having
reduced
them
by
a
candid
analysis
to
a
state
wherein
they
could
appear
in
their
full
force
i
have
been
told
adds
bayle
that
this
writer
after
copious
reflexion
upon
his
answer
and
upon
the
principle
of
his
opponent
finally
found
that
this
principle
could
be
reduced
to
the
form
of
a
demonstration
he
undertook
therefore
to
prove
that
there
is
no
cause
of
all
things
other
than
a
nature
which
exists
necessarily
and
which
acts
according
to
an
immutable
inevitable
and
irrevocable
necessity
he
examined
the
whole
system
of
the
geometricians
and
after
having
constructed
his
demonstration
he
scrutinized
it
from
every
imaginable
angle
he
endeavoured
to
find
its
weak
spot
and
was
never
able
to
discover
any
means
of
destroying
it
or
even
of
weakening
it
that
caused
him
real
distress
he
groaned
over
it
and
begged
the
most
talented
of
his
friends
to
help
him
in
searching
out
the
defects
of
this
demonstration
for
all
that
he
was
not
well
pleased
that
copies
of
the
book
were
made
franz
cuper
a
socinian
who
had
written
atheismi
against
spinoza
rotterdam
in
having
obtained
a
copy
published
it
just
as
it
was
that
is
in
flemish
with
some
reflexions
and
accused
the
author
of
being
an
atheist
the
accused
made
his
defence
in
the
same
tongue
orobio
a
very
able
jewish
physician
that
one
who
was
refuted
by
limbourg
and
who
replied
so
i
have
heard
say
in
a
work
posthumously
circulated
but
unpublished
brought
out
a
book
opposing
demonstration
entitled
philosophicum
propugnatae
veritatis
divinae
ac
naturalis
adversus
principia
aubert
de
versé
also
wrote
in
opposition
to
him
the
same
year
under
the
name
of
latinus
serbattus
sartensis
bredenburg
protested
that
he
was
convinced
of
free
will
and
of
religion
and
that
he
wished
he
might
be
shown
a
possibility
of
refuting
his
own
demonstration
i
would
desire
to
see
this
alleged
demonstration
and
to
know
whether
it
tended
to
prove
that
primitive
nature
which
produces
all
acts
without
choice
and
without
knowledge
in
this
case
i
admit
that
his
proof
was
spinozistic
and
dangerous
but
if
he
meant
perhaps
that
the
divine
nature
is
determined
toward
that
which
it
produces
by
its
choice
and
through
the
motive
of
the
best
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
grieve
about
this
immutable
inevitable
irrevocable
necessity
it
is
only
moral
it
is
a
happy
necessity
and
instead
of
destroying
religion
it
shows
divine
perfection
to
the
best
advantage
i
take
this
opportunity
to
add
that
bayle
quotes
the
opinion
of
those
who
believe
that
the
book
entitled
antistii
constantis
de
jure
ecclesiasticorum
liber
published
in
is
by
spinoza
but
i
have
reason
for
doubting
this
despite
that
colerus
who
has
passed
on
to
me
an
account
he
wrote
of
the
life
of
that
famous
jew
is
also
of
that
opinion
the
initial
letters
lead
me
to
believe
that
the
author
of
this
book
was
de
la
cour
or
van
den
hoof
famous
for
works
on
the
of
holland
political
and
numerous
other
books
that
he
published
some
of
them
under
the
signature
attacking
the
power
of
the
governor
of
holland
which
was
at
that
time
considered
a
danger
to
the
republic
for
the
memory
of
prince
william
the
second
attempt
upon
the
city
of
amsterdam
was
still
quite
fresh
most
of
the
ecclesiastics
of
holland
were
on
the
side
of
this
prince
son
who
was
then
a
minor
and
they
suspected
de
witt
and
what
was
called
the
lowenstein
faction
of
favouring
the
arminians
the
cartesians
and
other
sects
that
were
feared
still
more
endeavouring
to
rouse
the
populace
against
them
and
not
without
success
as
the
event
proved
it
was
thus
very
natural
that
de
la
cour
should
publish
this
book
it
is
true
that
people
seldom
keep
to
the
happy
mean
in
works
published
to
further
party
interests
i
will
say
in
passing
that
a
french
version
of
the
of
by
de
la
cour
has
just
been
published
under
the
deceptive
title
of
de
le
de
as
if
the
thoughts
of
a
private
individual
who
was
to
be
sure
of
de
witt
party
and
a
man
of
talent
but
who
had
not
enough
acquaintance
with
public
affairs
or
enough
ability
to
write
as
that
great
minister
of
state
might
have
written
could
pass
for
the
production
of
one
of
the
first
men
of
his
time
i
saw
de
la
cour
as
well
as
spinoza
on
my
return
from
france
by
way
of
england
and
holland
and
i
learnt
from
them
a
few
good
anecdotes
on
the
affairs
of
that
time
bayle
says
that
spinoza
studied
latin
under
a
physician
named
franz
van
den
ende
he
tells
at
the
same
time
on
the
authority
of
sebastian
kortholt
who
refers
to
it
in
the
preface
to
the
second
edition
of
the
book
by
his
late
father
tribus
impostoribus
herberto
de
cherbury
hobbio
et
that
a
girl
instructed
spinoza
in
latin
and
that
she
afterwards
married
kerkering
who
was
her
pupil
at
the
same
time
as
spinoza
in
connexion
with
that
i
note
that
this
young
lady
was
a
daughter
of
van
den
ende
and
that
she
assisted
her
father
in
the
work
of
teaching
van
den
ende
who
was
also
called
finibus
later
went
to
paris
and
there
kept
a
in
the
faubourg
antoine
he
was
considered
excellent
as
an
instructor
and
he
told
me
when
i
called
upon
him
there
that
he
would
wager
that
his
audiences
would
always
pay
attention
to
his
words
he
had
with
him
as
well
at
that
time
a
young
girl
who
also
spoke
latin
and
worked
upon
geometrical
demonstrations
he
had
insinuated
himself
into
arnauld
good
graces
and
the
jesuits
began
to
be
jealous
of
his
reputation
but
he
disappeared
shortly
afterwards
having
been
mixed
up
in
the
chevalier
de
conspiracy
i
think
i
have
sufficiently
proved
that
neither
the
foreknowledge
nor
the
providence
of
god
can
impair
either
his
justice
or
his
goodness
or
our
freedom
there
remains
only
the
difficulty
arising
from
with
the
actions
of
the
creature
which
seems
to
concern
more
closely
both
his
goodness
in
relation
to
our
evil
actions
and
our
freedom
in
relation
to
good
actions
as
well
as
to
others
bayle
has
brought
out
this
also
with
his
usual
acuteness
i
will
endeavour
to
throw
light
upon
the
difficulties
he
puts
forward
and
then
i
shall
be
in
a
position
to
conclude
this
work
i
have
already
proved
that
the
of
god
consists
in
giving
us
continually
all
that
is
real
in
us
and
in
our
actions
in
so
far
as
it
involves
perfection
but
that
all
that
is
limited
and
imperfect
therein
is
a
consequence
of
the
previous
limitations
which
are
originally
in
the
creature
since
moreover
every
action
of
the
creature
is
a
change
of
its
modifications
it
is
obvious
that
action
arises
in
the
creature
in
relation
to
the
limitations
or
negations
which
it
has
within
itself
and
which
are
diversified
by
this
change
i
have
already
pointed
out
more
than
once
in
this
work
that
evil
is
a
consequence
of
privation
and
i
think
that
i
have
explained
that
intelligibly
enough
augustine
has
already
put
forward
this
idea
and
st
basil
said
something
of
the
same
kind
in
his
homil
vice
is
not
a
living
and
animate
substance
but
an
affection
of
the
soul
contrary
to
virtue
which
arises
from
one
abandoning
the
good
and
there
is
therefore
no
need
to
look
for
an
original
evil
bayle
quoting
this
passage
in
his
art
lit
d
commends
a
remark
by
herr
pfanner
whom
he
calls
a
german
theologian
but
he
is
a
jurist
by
profession
counsellor
to
the
dukes
of
saxony
who
censures
st
basil
for
not
being
willing
to
admit
that
god
is
the
author
of
physical
evil
doubtless
god
is
its
author
when
the
moral
evil
is
assumed
to
be
already
in
existence
but
speaking
generally
one
might
assert
that
god
permitted
physical
evil
by
implication
in
permitting
moral
evil
which
is
its
source
it
appears
that
the
stoics
knew
also
how
slender
is
the
entity
of
evil
these
words
of
epictetus
are
an
indication
aberrandi
causa
meta
non
ponitur
sic
nec
natura
mali
in
mundo
existit
there
was
therefore
no
need
to
have
recourse
to
a
principle
of
evil
as
st
basil
aptly
observes
nor
is
it
necessary
either
to
seek
the
origin
of
evil
in
matter
those
who
believed
that
there
was
a
chaos
before
god
laid
his
hand
upon
it
sought
therein
the
source
of
disorder
it
was
an
opinion
which
plato
introduced
into
his
aristotle
found
fault
with
him
for
that
in
his
third
book
on
heaven
ch
because
according
to
this
doctrine
disorder
would
be
original
and
natural
and
order
would
have
been
introduced
against
nature
this
anaxagoras
avoided
by
making
matter
remain
at
rest
until
it
was
stirred
by
god
and
aristotle
in
the
same
passage
commends
him
for
it
according
to
plutarch
iside
et
and
de
animae
procreatione
ex
plato
recognized
in
matter
a
certain
maleficent
soul
or
force
rebellious
against
god
it
was
an
actual
blemish
an
obstacle
to
god
plans
the
stoics
also
believed
that
matter
was
the
source
of
defects
as
justus
lipsius
showed
in
the
first
book
of
the
physiology
of
the
stoics
aristotle
was
right
in
rejecting
chaos
but
it
is
not
always
easy
to
disentangle
the
conceptions
of
plato
and
such
a
task
would
be
still
less
easy
in
respect
of
some
ancient
authors
whose
works
are
lost
kepler
one
of
the
most
excellent
of
modern
mathematicians
recognized
a
species
of
imperfection
in
matter
even
when
there
is
no
irregular
motion
he
calls
it
its
inertia
which
gives
it
a
resistance
to
motion
whereby
a
greater
mass
receives
less
speed
from
one
and
the
same
force
there
is
soundness
in
this
observation
and
i
have
used
it
to
advantage
in
this
work
in
order
to
have
a
comparison
such
as
should
illustrate
how
the
original
imperfection
of
the
creatures
sets
bounds
to
the
action
of
the
creator
which
tends
towards
good
but
as
matter
is
itself
of
creation
it
only
furnishes
a
comparison
and
an
example
and
can
not
be
the
very
source
of
evil
and
of
imperfection
i
have
already
shown
that
this
source
lies
in
the
forms
or
ideas
of
the
possibles
for
it
must
be
eternal
and
matter
is
not
so
now
since
god
made
all
positive
reality
that
is
not
eternal
he
would
have
made
the
source
of
evil
if
that
did
not
rather
lie
in
the
possibility
of
things
or
forms
that
which
alone
god
did
not
make
since
he
is
not
the
author
of
his
own
understanding
yet
even
though
the
source
of
evil
lies
in
the
possible
forms
anterior
to
the
acts
of
god
will
it
is
nevertheless
true
that
god
in
evil
in
the
actual
performance
of
introducing
these
forms
into
matter
and
this
is
what
causes
the
difficulty
in
question
here
durand
de
cardinal
aureolus
nicolas
taurel
father
louis
de
dole
bernier
and
some
others
speaking
of
this
would
have
it
only
general
for
fear
of
impairing
the
freedom
of
man
and
the
holiness
of
god
they
seem
to
maintain
that
god
having
given
to
creatures
the
power
to
act
contents
himself
with
conserving
this
power
on
the
other
hand
bayle
according
to
some
modern
writers
carries
the
cooperation
of
god
too
far
he
seems
to
fear
lest
the
creature
be
not
sufficiently
dependent
upon
god
he
goes
so
far
as
to
deny
action
to
creatures
he
does
not
even
acknowledge
any
real
distinction
between
accident
and
substance
he
places
great
reliance
especially
on
that
doctrine
accepted
of
the
schoolmen
that
conservation
is
a
continued
creation
the
conclusion
to
be
drawn
from
this
doctrine
would
seem
to
be
that
the
creature
never
exists
that
it
is
ever
newborn
and
ever
dying
like
time
movement
and
other
transient
beings
plato
believed
this
of
material
and
tangible
things
saying
that
they
are
in
a
perpetual
flux
fluunt
nunquam
but
of
immaterial
substances
he
judged
quite
differently
regarding
them
alone
as
real
nor
was
he
in
that
altogether
mistaken
yet
continued
creation
applies
to
all
creatures
without
distinction
sundry
good
philosophers
have
been
opposed
to
this
dogma
and
bayle
tells
that
david
de
rodon
a
philosopher
renowned
among
those
of
the
french
who
have
adhered
to
geneva
deliberately
refuted
it
the
arminians
also
do
not
approve
of
it
they
are
not
much
in
favour
of
these
metaphysical
subtleties
i
will
say
nothing
of
the
socinians
who
relish
them
even
less
for
a
proper
enquiry
as
to
conservation
is
a
continued
creation
it
would
be
necessary
to
consider
the
reasons
whereon
this
dogma
is
founded
the
cartesians
after
the
example
of
their
master
employ
in
order
to
prove
it
a
principle
which
is
not
conclusive
enough
they
say
that
moments
of
time
having
no
necessary
connexion
with
one
another
it
does
not
follow
that
because
i
am
at
this
moment
i
shall
exist
at
the
moment
which
shall
follow
if
the
same
cause
which
gives
me
being
for
this
moment
does
not
also
give
it
to
me
for
the
instant
following
the
author
of
the
on
the
picture
of
has
made
use
of
this
argument
and
bayle
perhaps
the
author
of
this
same
quotes
it
to
the
questions
of
a
vol

ch
one
may
answer
that
in
fact
it
does
not
follow
that
because
i

i

this
follows
nevertheless
that
is
of
itself
if
nothing
prevents
it
it
is
the
distinction
that
can
be
drawn
between
the
essential
and
the
natural
for
the
same
movement
endures
naturally
unless
some
new
cause
prevents
it
or
changes
it
because
the
reason

makes

cease
at
this

if
it
is
no
new

would
have
already
made
it
cease
sooner
the
late
herr
erhard
weigel
a
celebrated
mathematician
and
philosopher
at
jena
well
known
for
his
his
mathematical
philosophy
some
neat
mechanical
inventions
and
finally
the
trouble
he
took
to
induce
the
protestant
princes
of
the
empire
to
undertake
the
last
reform
of
the
almanac
whose
success
notwithstanding
he
did
not
witness
herr
weigel
i
say
communicated
to
his
friends
a
certain
demonstration
of
the
existence
of
god
which
indeed
amounted
to
this
idea
of
continued
creation
as
he
was
wont
to
draw
parallels
between
reckoning
and
reasoning
witness
his
arithmetical
ethics
he
said
that
the
foundation
of
the
demonstration
was
this
beginning
of
the
pythagorean
table
one
is
these
repeated
unities
were
the
moments
of
the
existence
of
things
each
one
of
them
depending
upon
god
who
resuscitates
as
it
were
all
things
outside
himself
at
each
moment
falling
away
as
they
do
at
each
moment
they
must
ever
have
one
who
shall
resuscitate
them
and
that
can
not
be
any
other
than
god
but
there
would
be
need
of
a
more
exact
proof
if
that
is
to
be
called
a
demonstration
it
would
be
necessary
to
prove
that
the
creature
always
emerges
from
nothingness
and
relapses
thither
forthwith
in
particular
it
must
be
shown
that
the
privilege
of
enduring
more
than
a
moment
by
its
nature
belongs
to
the
necessary
being
alone
the
difficulties
on
the
composition
of
the
enter
also
into
this
matter
this
dogma
appears
to
resolve
time
into
moments
whereas
others
regard
moments
and
points
as
mere
modalities
of
the
that
is
as
extremities
of
the
parts
that
can
be
assigned
to
it
and
not
as
constituent
parts
but
this
is
not
the
place
for
entering
into
that
labyrinth
what
can
be
said
for
certain
on
the
present
subject
is
that
the
creature
depends
continually
upon
divine
operation
and
that
it
depends
upon
that
no
less
after
the
time
of
its
beginning
than
when
it
first
begins
this
dependence
implies
that
it
would
not
continue
to
exist
if
god
did
not
continue
to
act
in
short
that
this
action
of
god
is
free
for
if
it
were
a
necessary
emanation
like
that
of
the
properties
of
the
circle
which
issue
from
its
essence
it
must
then
be
said
that
god
in
the
beginning
produced
the
creature
by
necessity
or
else
it
must
be
shown
how
in
creating
it
once
he
imposed
upon
himself
the
necessity
of
conserving
it
now
there
is
no
reason
why
this
conserving
action
should
not
be
called
production
and
even
creation
if
one
will
for
the
dependence
being
as
great
afterwards
as
at
the
beginning
the
extrinsic
designation
of
being
new
or
not
does
not
change
the
nature
of
that
action
let
us
then
admit
in
such
a
sense
that
conservation
is
a
continued
creation
and
let
us
see
what
bayle
seems
to
infer
thence
after
the
author
of
the
on
the
picture
of
in
opposition
to
jurieu
seems
to
me
this
writer
says
one
must
conclude
that
god
does
all
and
that
in
all
creation
there
are
no
first
or
second
or
even
occasional
causes
as
can
be
easily
proved
at
this
moment
when
i
speak
i
am
such
as
i
am
with
all
my
circumstances
with
such
thought
such
action
whether
i
sit
or
stand
that
if
god
creates
me
in
this
moment
such
as
i
am
as
one
must
of
necessity
say
in
this
system
he
creates
me
with
such
thought
such
action
such
movement
and
such
determination
one
can
not
say
that
god
creates
me
in
the
first
place
and
that
once
i
am
created
he
produces
with
me
my
movements
and
my
determinations
that
is
indefensible
for
two
reasons
the
first
is
that
when
god
creates
me
or
conserves
me
at
this
instant
he
does
not
conserve
me
as
a
being
without
form
like
a
species
or
another
of
the
universals
of
logic
i
am
an
individual
he
creates
me
and
conserves
me
as
such
and
as
being
all
that
i
am
in
this
instant
with
all
my
attendant
circumstances
the
second
reason
is
that
if
god
creates
me
in
this
instant
and
one
says
that
afterwards
he
produces
with
me
my
actions
it
will
be
necessary
to
imagine
another
instant
for
action
for
before
acting
one
must
exist
now
that
would
be
two
instants
where
we
only
assume
one
it
is
therefore
certain
in
this
hypothesis
that
creatures
have
neither
more
connexion
nor
more
relation
with
their
actions
than
they
had
with
their
production
at
the
first
moment
of
the
first
creation
the
author
of
this
draws
thence
very
harsh
conclusions
which
one
can
picture
to
oneself
and
he
testifies
at
the
end
that
one
would
be
deeply
indebted
to
any
man
that
should
teach
those
who
approve
this
system
how
to
extricate
themselves
from
these
frightful
absurdities
bayle
carries
this
still
further
know
he
says
it
is
demonstrated
in
the
scholastic
writings
he
cites
arriaga
sect
et
praesertim
the
creature
can
not
be
either
the
total
cause
or
the
partial
cause
of
its
conservation
for
if
it
were
it
would
exist
before
existing
which
is
contradictory
you
know
that
the
argument
proceeds
like
this
that
which
conserves
itself
acts
now
that
which
acts
exists
and
nothing
can
act
before
it
has
attained
complete
existence
therefore
if
a
creature
conserved
itself
it
would
act
before
being
this
argument
is
not
founded
upon
probabilities
but
upon
the
first
principles
of
metaphysics
entis
nulla
sunt
accidentia
operari
sequitur
axioms
as
clear
as
daylight
let
us
go
further
if
creatures
with
god
here
is
meant
an
active
cooperation
and
not
by
a
passive
instrument
to
conserve
themselves
they
would
act
before
being
that
has
been
demonstrated
now
if
they
with
god
for
the
production
of
any
other
thing
they
would
also
act
before
being
it
is
therefore
as
impossible
for
them
to
with
god
for
the
production
of
any
other
thing
such
as
local
movement
an
affirmation
volition
entities
actually
distinct
from
their
substance
so
it
is
asserted
as
for
their
own
conservation
since
their
conservation
is
a
continued
creation
and
since
all
human
creatures
in
the
world
must
confess
that
they
can
not
with
god
at
the
first
moment
of
their
existence
either
to
produce
themselves
or
to
give
themselves
any
modality
since
that
would
be
to
act
before
being
observe
that
thomas
aquinas
and
sundry
other
schoolmen
teach
that
if
the
angels
had
sinned
at
the
first
moment
of
their
creation
god
would
be
the
author
of
the
sin
see
the
feuillant
pierre
de
joseph
of
the
concordia
humanae
it
is
a
sign
that
they
acknowledge
that
at
the
first
instant
the
creature
can
not
act
in
anything
whatsoever
it
follows
manifestly
that
they
can
not
with
god
in
any
one
of
the
subsequent
moments
either
to
produce
themselves
or
to
produce
any
other
thing
if
they
could
therein
at
the
second
moment
of
their
existence
nothing
would
prevent
their
being
able
to
cooperate
at
the
first
moment
this
is
the
way
it
will
be
necessary
to
answer
these
arguments
let
us
assume
that
the
creature
is
produced
anew
at
each
instant
let
us
grant
also
that
the
instant
excludes
all
priority
of
time
being
indivisible
but
let
us
point
out
that
it
does
not
exclude
priority
of
nature
or
what
is
called
anteriority
signo
rationis
and
that
this
is
sufficient
the
production
or
action
whereby
god
produces
is
anterior
by
nature
to
the
existence
of
the
creature
that
is
produced
the
creature
taken
in
itself
with
its
nature
and
its
necessary
properties
is
anterior
to
its
accidental
affections
and
to
its
actions
and
yet
all
these
things
are
in
being
in
the
same
moment
god
produces
the
creature
in
conformity
with
the
exigency
of
the
preceding
instants
according
to
the
laws
of
his
wisdom
and
the
creature
operates
in
conformity
with
that
nature
which
god
conveys
to
it
in
creating
it
always
the
limitations
and
imperfections
arise
therein
through
the
nature
of
the
subject
which
sets
bounds
to
production
this
is
the
consequence
of
the
original
imperfection
of
creatures
vice
and
crime
on
the
other
hand
arise
there
through
the
free
inward
operation
of
the
creature
in
so
far
as
this
can
occur
within
the
instant
repetition
afterwards
rendering
it
discernible
this
anteriority
of
nature
is
a
commonplace
in
philosophy
thus
one
says
that
the
decrees
of
god
have
an
order
among
themselves
when
one
ascribes
to
god
and
rightly
so
understanding
of
the
arguments
and
conclusions
of
creatures
in
such
sort
that
all
their
demonstrations
and
syllogisms
are
known
to
him
and
are
found
in
him
in
a
transcendent
way
one
sees
that
there
is
in
the
propositions
or
truths
a
natural
order
but
there
is
no
order
of
time
or
interval
to
cause
him
to
advance
in
knowledge
and
pass
from
the
premisses
to
the
conclusion
i
find
in
the
arguments
that
have
just
been
quoted
nothing
which
these
reflexions
fail
to
satisfy
when
god
produces
the
thing
he
produces
it
as
an
individual
and
not
as
a
universal
of
logic
i
admit
but
he
produces
its
essence
before
its
accidents
its
nature
before
its
operations
following
the
priority
of
their
nature
and
signo
anteriore
thus
one
sees
how
the
creature
can
be
the
true
cause
of
the
sin
while
conservation
by
god
does
not
prevent
the
sin
god
disposes
in
accordance
with
the
preceding
state
of
the
same
creature
in
order
to
follow
the
laws
of
his
wisdom
notwithstanding
the
sin
which
in
the
first
place
will
be
produced
by
the
creature
but
it
is
true
that
god
would
not
in
the
beginning
have
created
the
soul
in
a
state
wherein
it
would
have
sinned
from
the
first
moment
as
the
schoolmen
have
justly
observed
for
there
is
nothing
in
the
laws
of
his
wisdom
that
could
have
induced
him
so
to
do
this
law
of
wisdom
brings
it
about
also
that
god
reproduces
the
same
substance
the
same
soul
such
was
the
answer
that
could
have
been
given
by
the
abbé
whom
bayle
introduces
in
his
art
lit
b
this
wisdom
effects
the
connexion
of
things
i
concede
therefore
that
the
creature
does
not
with
god
to
conserve
himself
in
the
sense
in
which
i
have
just
explained
conservation
but
i
see
nothing
to
prevent
the
creature
with
god
for
the
production
of
any
other
thing
and
especially
might
this
concern
its
inward
operation
as
in
the
case
of
a
thought
or
a
volition
things
really
distinct
from
the
substance
but
there
i
am
once
more
at
grips
with
bayle
he
maintains
that
there
are
no
such
accidents
distinct
from
the
substance
reasons
he
says
our
modern
philosophers
have
employed
to
demonstrate
that
the
accidents
are
not
beings
in
reality
distinct
from
the
substance
are
not
mere
difficulties
they
are
arguments
which
overwhelm
one
and
which
can
not
be
refuted
take
the
trouble
he
adds
look
for
them
in
the
writings
of
father
maignan
or
father
malebranche
or
calli
professor
of
philosophy
at
caen
in
the
of
father
saguens
disciple
of
father
maignan
the
extract
from
which
is
to
be
found
in
the
de
la
république
des
june
or
if
you
wish
one
author
only
to
suffice
you
choose
dom
françois
lami
a
benedictine
monk
and
one
of
the
strongest
cartesians
to
be
found
in
france
you
will
find
among
his
printed
at
trévoux
in
that
one
wherein
by
the
geometricians
method
he
demonstrates
that
god
is
the
sole
true
cause
of
all
that
which
is
real
i
would
wish
to
see
all
these
books
and
as
for
this
last
proposition
it
may
be
true
in
a
very
good
sense
god
is
the
one
principal
cause
of
pure
and
absolute
realities
or
of
perfections
secundae
agunt
in
virtute
but
when
one
comprises
limitations
and
privations
under
the
term
realities
one
may
say
that
the
second
causes
in
the
production
of
that
which
is
limited
otherwise
god
would
be
the
cause
of
sin
and
even
the
sole
cause
it
is
well
to
beware
moreover
lest
in
confusing
substances
with
accidents
in
depriving
created
substances
of
action
one
fall
into
spinozism
which
is
an
exaggerated
cartesianism
that
which
does
not
act
does
not
merit
the
name
of
substance
if
the
accidents
are
not
distinct
from
the
substances
if
the
created
substance
is
a
successive
being
like
movement
if
it
does
not
endure
beyond
a
moment
and
does
not
remain
the
same
during
some
stated
portion
of
time
any
more
than
its
accidents
if
it
does
not
operate
any
more
than
a
mathematical
figure
or
a
number
why
shall
one
not
say
with
spinoza
that
god
is
the
only
substance
and
that
creatures
are
only
accidents
or
modifications
hitherto
it
has
been
supposed
that
the
substance
remains
and
that
the
accidents
change
and
i
think
one
ought
still
to
abide
by
this
ancient
doctrine
for
the
arguments
i
remember
having
read
do
not
prove
the
contrary
and
prove
more
than
is
needed
of
the
absurdities
says
bayle
arise
from
the
distinction
which
is
alleged
to
exist
between
substances
and
their
accidents
is
that
creatures
if
they
produce
the
accidents
would
possess
a
power
of
creation
and
annihilation
accordingly
one
could
not
perform
the
slightest
action
without
creating
an
innumerable
number
of
real
beings
and
without
reducing
to
nothingness
an
endless
multitude
of
them
merely
by
moving
the
tongue
to
cry
out
or
to
eat
one
creates
as
many
accidents
as
there
are
movements
of
the
parts
of
the
tongue
and
one
destroys
as
many
accidents
as
there
are
parts
of
that
which
one
eats
which
lose
their
form
which
become
chyle
blood
etc
this
argument
is
only
a
kind
of
bugbear
what
harm
would
be
done
supposing
that
an
infinity
of
movements
an
infinity
of
figures
spring
up
and
disappear
at
every
moment
in
the
universe
and
even
in
each
part
of
the
universe
it
can
be
demonstrated
moreover
that
that
must
be
so
as
for
the
creation
of
the
accidents
who
does
not
see
that
one
needs
no
creative
power
in
order
to
change
place
or
shape
to
form
a
square
or
a
column
or
some
other
figure
by
the
movement
of
the
soldiers
who
are
drilling
or
again
to
fashion
a
statue
by
removing
a
few
pieces
from
a
block
of
marble
or
to
make
some
figure
in
relief
by
changing
decreasing
or
increasing
a
piece
of
wax
the
production
of
modifications
has
never
been
called
and
it
is
an
abuse
of
terms
to
scare
the
world
thus
god
produces
substances
from
nothing
and
the
substances
produce
accidents
by
the
changes
of
their
limits
as
for
the
souls
or
substantial
forms
bayle
is
right
in
adding
there
is
nothing
more
inconvenient
for
those
who
admit
substantial
forms
than
the
objection
which
is
made
that
they
could
not
be
produced
save
by
an
actual
creation
and
that
the
schoolmen
are
pitiable
in
their
endeavours
to
answer
this
but
there
is
nothing
more
convenient
for
me
and
for
my
system
than
this
same
objection
for
i
maintain
that
all
the
souls
entelechies
or
primitive
forces
substantial
forms
simple
substances
or
monads
whatever
name
one
may
apply
to
them
can
neither
spring
up
naturally
nor
perish
and
the
qualities
or
derivative
forces
or
what
are
called
accidental
forms
i
take
to
be
modifications
of
the
primitive
entelechy
even
as
shapes
are
modifications
of
matter
that
is
why
these
modifications
are
perpetually
changing
while
the
simple
substance
remains
i
have
shown
already
part
i
that
souls
can
not
spring
up
naturally
or
be
derived
from
one
another
and
that
it
is
necessary
that
ours
either
be
created
or
be
i
have
even
pointed
out
a
certain
middle
way
between
a
creation
and
an
entire
i
find
it
appropriate
to
say
that
the
soul
preexisting
in
the
seeds
from
the
beginning
of
things
was
only
sentient
but
that
it
was
elevated
to
the
superior
degree
which
is
that
of
reason
when
the
man
to
whom
this
soul
should
belong
was
conceived
and
when
the
organic
body
always
accompanying
this
soul
from
the
beginning
but
under
many
changes
was
determined
for
forming
the
human
body
i
considered
also
that
one
might
attribute
this
elevation
of
the
sentient
soul
which
makes
it
reach
a
more
sublime
degree
of
being
namely
reason
to
the
extraordinary
operation
of
god
nevertheless
it
will
be
well
to
add
that
i
would
dispense
with
miracles
in
the
generating
of
man
as
in
that
of
the
other
animals
it
will
be
possible
to
explain
that
if
one
imagines
that
in
this
great
number
of
souls
and
of
animals
or
at
least
of
living
organic
bodies
which
are
in
the
seeds
those
souls
alone
which
are
destined
to
attain
one
day
to
human
nature
contain
the
reason
that
shall
appear
therein
one
day
and
the
organic
bodies
of
these
souls
alone
are
preformed
and
predisposed
to
assume
one
day
the
human
shape
while
the
other
small
animals
or
seminal
living
beings
in
which
no
such
thing
is
are
essentially
different
from
them
and
possessed
only
of
an
inferior
nature
this
production
is
a
kind
of
but
more
manageable
than
that
kind
which
is
commonly
taught
it
does
not
derive
the
soul
from
a
soul
but
only
the
animate
from
an
animate
and
it
avoids
the
repeated
miracles
of
a
new
creation
which
would
cause
a
new
and
pure
soul
to
enter
a
body
that
must
corrupt
it
i
am
however
of
the
same
opinion
as
father
malebranche
that
in
general
creation
properly
understood
is
not
so
difficult
to
admit
as
might
be
supposed
and
that
it
is
in
a
sense
involved
in
the
notion
of
the
dependence
of
creatures
stupid
and
ridiculous
are
the
philosophers
he
exclaims
in
his
no
assume
that
creation
is
impossible
because
they
can
not
conceive
how
god
power
is
great
enough
to
make
something
from
nothing
but
can
they
any
better
conceive
how
the
power
of
god
is
capable
of
stirring
a
straw
he
adds
again
with
great
truth
no
matter
were
uncreate
god
could
not
move
it
or
form
anything
from
it
for
god
can
not
move
matter
or
arrange
it
wisely
if
he
does
not
know
it
now
god
can
not
know
it
if
he
does
not
give
it
being
he
can
derive
his
knowledge
only
from
himself
nothing
can
act
on
him
or
enlighten
him
bayle
not
content
with
saying
that
we
are
created
continually
insists
also
on
this
other
doctrine
which
he
would
fain
derive
thence
that
our
soul
can
not
act
this
is
the
way
he
speaks
on
that
matter
ch
has
too
much
acquaintance
with
cartesianism
it
is
of
an
able
opponent
he
is
speaking
to
know
with
what
force
it
has
been
maintained
in
our
day
that
there
is
no
creature
capable
of
producing
motion
and
that
our
soul
is
a
purely
passive
subject
in
relation
to
sensations
and
ideas
and
feelings
of
pain
and
of
pleasure
etc
if
this
has
not
been
carried
as
far
as
the
volitions
that
is
on
account
of
the
existence
of
revealed
truths
otherwise
the
acts
of
the
will
would
have
been
found
as
passive
as
those
of
the
understanding
the
same
reasons
which
prove
that
our
soul
does
not
form
our
ideas
and
does
not
stir
our
organs
would
prove
also
that
it
can
not
form
our
acts
of
love
and
our
volitions
etc
he
might
add
our
vicious
actions
our
crimes
the
force
of
these
proofs
which
he
praises
must
not
be
so
great
as
he
thinks
for
if
it
were
they
would
prove
too
much
they
would
make
god
the
author
of
sin
i
admit
that
the
soul
can
not
stir
the
organs
by
a
physical
influence
for
i
think
that
the
body
must
have
been
so
formed
beforehand
that
it
would
do
in
time
and
place
that
which
responds
to
the
volitions
of
the
soul
although
it
be
true
nevertheless
that
the
soul
is
the
principle
of
the
operation
but
if
it
be
said
that
the
soul
does
not
produce
its
thoughts
its
sensations
its
feelings
of
pain
and
of
pleasure
that
is
something
for
which
i
see
no
reason
in
my
system
every
simple
substance
that
is
every
true
substance
must
be
the
true
immediate
cause
of
all
its
actions
and
inward
passions
and
speaking
strictly
in
a
metaphysical
sense
it
has
none
other
than
those
which
it
produces
those
who
hold
a
different
opinion
and
who
make
god
the
sole
agent
are
needlessly
becoming
involved
in
expressions
whence
they
will
only
with
difficulty
extricate
themselves
without
offence
against
religion
moreover
they
unquestionably
offend
against
reason
here
is
however
the
foundation
of
bayle
argument
he
says
that
we
do
not
do
that
of
which
we
know
not
the
way
it
is
done
but
it
is
a
principle
which
i
do
not
concede
to
him
let
us
listen
to
his
dissertation
seqq
is
an
astonishing
thing
that
almost
all
philosophers
with
the
exception
of
those
who
expounded
aristotle
and
who
admitted
a
universal
intelligence
distinct
from
our
soul
and
cause
of
our
perceptions
see
in
the
and
critical
note
e
of
the
article
averroes
have
shared
the
popular
belief
that
we
form
our
ideas
actively
yet
where
is
the
man
who
knows
not
on
the
one
hand
that
he
is
in
absolute
ignorance
as
to
how
ideas
are
made
and
on
the
other
hand
that
he
could
not
sew
two
stitches
if
he
were
ignorant
of
how
to
sew
is
the
sewing
of
two
stitches
in
itself
a
work
more
difficult
than
the
painting
in
mind
of
a
rose
the
very
first
time
one
eyes
rest
upon
it
and
although
one
has
never
learnt
this
kind
of
painting
does
it
not
appear
on
the
contrary
that
this
mental
portrait
is
in
itself
a
work
more
difficult
than
tracing
on
canvas
the
shape
of
a
flower
a
thing
we
can
not
do
without
having
learnt
it
we
are
all
convinced
that
a
key
would
be
of
no
use
to
us
for
opening
a
chest
if
we
were
ignorant
as
to
how
to
use
the
key
and
yet
we
imagine
that
our
soul
is
the
efficient
cause
of
the
movement
of
our
arms
despite
that
it
knows
neither
where
the
nerves
are
which
must
be
used
for
this
movement
nor
whence
to
obtain
the
animal
spirits
that
are
to
flow
into
these
nerves
we
have
the
experience
every
day
that
the
ideas
we
would
fain
recall
do
not
come
and
that
they
appear
of
themselves
when
we
are
no
longer
thinking
of
them
if
that
does
not
prevent
us
from
thinking
that
we
are
their
efficient
cause
what
reliance
shall
one
place
on
the
proof
of
feeling
which
to
jacquelot
appears
so
conclusive
does
our
authority
over
our
ideas
more
often
fall
short
than
our
authority
over
our
volitions
if
we
were
to
count
up
carefully
we
should
find
in
the
course
of
our
life
more
velleities
than
volitions
that
is
more
evidences
of
the
servitude
of
our
will
than
of
its
dominion
how
many
times
does
one
and
the
same
man
not
experience
an
inability
to
do
a
certain
act
of
will
for
example
an
act
of
love
for
a
man
who
had
just
injured
him
an
act
of
scorn
for
a
fine
sonnet
that
he
had
composed
an
act
of
hatred
for
a
mistress
an
act
of
approval
of
an
absurd
epigram
take
note
that
i
speak
only
of
inward
acts
expressed
by
an
i
will
such
as
i
will
scorn
approve
etc
even
if
there
were
a
hundred
pistoles
to
be
gained
forthwith
and
he
ardently
desired
to
gain
these
hundred
pistoles
and
he
were
fired
with
the
ambition
to
convince
himself
by
an
experimental
proof
that
he
is
master
in
his
own
domain
put
together
in
few
words
the
whole
force
of
what
i
have
just
said
to
you
i
will
observe
that
it
is
evident
to
all
those
who
go
deeply
into
things
that
the
true
efficient
cause
of
an
effect
must
know
the
effect
and
be
aware
also
of
the
way
in
which
it
must
be
produced
that
is
not
necessary
when
one
is
only
the
instrument
of
the
cause
or
only
the
passive
subject
of
its
action
but
one
can
not
conceive
of
it
as
not
necessary
to
a
true
agent
now
if
we
examine
ourselves
well
we
shall
be
strongly
convinced
that
independently
of
experience
our
soul
is
just
as
little
aware
of
what
a
volition
is
as
of
what
an
idea
is
that
after
a
long
experience
it
is
no
more
fully
aware
of
how
volitions
are
formed
than
it
was
before
having
willed
anything
what
is
one
to
conclude
from
that
save
that
the
soul
can
not
be
the
efficient
cause
of
its
volitions
any
more
than
of
its
ideas
and
of
the
motion
of
the
spirits
which
cause
our
arms
to
move
take
note
that
no
pretence
is
made
of
deciding
the
point
here
absolutely
it
is
only
being
considered
in
relation
to
the
principles
of
the
objection
that
is
indeed
a
strange
way
of
reasoning
what
necessity
is
there
for
one
always
to
be
aware
how
that
which
is
done
is
done
are
salts
metals
plants
animals
and
a
thousand
other
animate
or
inanimate
bodies
aware
how
that
which
they
do
is
done
and
need
they
be
aware
must
a
drop
of
oil
or
of
fat
understand
geometry
in
order
to
become
round
on
the
surface
of
water
sewing
stitches
is
another
matter
one
acts
for
an
end
one
must
be
aware
of
the
means
but
we
do
not
form
our
ideas
because
we
will
to
do
so
they
form
themselves
within
us
they
form
themselves
through
us
not
in
consequence
of
our
will
but
in
accordance
with
our
nature
and
that
of
things
the
foetus
forms
itself
in
the
animal
and
a
thousand
other
wonders
of
nature
are
produced
by
a
certain
that
god
has
placed
there
that
is
by
virtue
of
which
has
made
these
admirable
automata
adapted
to
produce
mechanically
such
beautiful
effects
even
so
it
is
easy
to
believe
that
the
soul
is
a
spiritual
automaton
still
more
admirable
and
that
it
is
through
divine
preformation
that
it
produces
these
beautiful
ideas
wherein
our
will
has
no
part
and
to
which
our
art
can
not
attain
the
operation
of
spiritual
automata
that
is
of
souls
is
not
mechanical
but
it
contains
in
the
highest
degree
all
that
is
beautiful
in
mechanism
the
movements
which
are
developed
in
bodies
are
concentrated
in
the
soul
by
representation
as
in
an
ideal
world
which
expresses
the
laws
of
the
actual
world
and
their
consequences
but
with
this
difference
from
the
perfect
ideal
world
which
is
in
god
that
most
of
the
perceptions
in
the
other
substances
are
only
confused
for
it
is
plain
that
every
simple
substance
embraces
the
whole
universe
in
its
confused
perceptions
or
sensations
and
that
the
succession
of
these
perceptions
is
regulated
by
the
particular
nature
of
this
substance
but
in
a
manner
which
always
expresses
all
the
nature
in
the
universe
and
every
present
perception
leads
to
a
new
perception
just
as
every
movement
that
it
represents
leads
to
another
movement
but
it
is
impossible
that
the
soul
can
know
clearly
its
whole
nature
and
perceive
how
this
innumerable
number
of
small
perceptions
piled
up
or
rather
concentrated
together
shapes
itself
there
to
that
end
it
must
needs
know
completely
the
whole
universe
which
is
embraced
by
them
that
is
it
must
needs
be
a
god
as
regards
they
are
only
a
very
imperfect
kind
of
conditional
will
i
would
if
i
could
si
and
in
the
case
of
a
velleity
we
do
not
will
properly
speaking
to
will
but
to
be
able
that
explains
why
there
are
none
in
god
and
they
must
not
be
confused
with
antecedent
will
i
have
explained
sufficiently
elsewhere
that
our
control
over
volitions
can
be
exercised
only
indirectly
and
that
one
would
be
unhappy
if
one
were
sufficiently
master
in
one
own
domain
to
be
able
to
will
without
cause
without
rhyme
or
reason
to
complain
of
not
having
such
a
control
would
be
to
argue
like
pliny
who
carps
at
the
power
of
god
because
god
can
not
destroy
himself
i
intended
to
finish
here
after
having
met
as
it
seems
to
me
all
the
objections
of
bayle
on
this
matter
that
i
could
find
in
his
works
but
remembering
laurentius
valla
on
free
will
in
opposition
to
boethius
which
i
have
already
mentioned
i
thought
it
would
be
opportune
to
quote
it
in
abstract
retaining
the
dialogue
form
and
then
to
continue
from
where
it
ends
keeping
up
the
fiction
it
initiated
and
that
less
with
the
purpose
of
enlivening
the
subject
than
in
order
to
explain
myself
towards
the
end
of
my
dissertation
as
clearly
as
i
can
and
in
a
way
most
likely
to
be
generally
understood
this
dialogue
of
valla
and
his
books
on
pleasure
and
the
true
good
make
it
plain
that
he
was
no
less
a
philosopher
than
a
humanist
these
four
books
were
opposed
to
the
four
books
on
the
of
by
boethius
and
the
dialogue
to
the
fifth
book
a
certain
spaniard
named
antonio
glarea
requests
of
him
elucidation
on
the
difficulty
of
free
will
whereof
little
is
known
as
it
is
worthy
to
be
known
for
upon
it
depend
justice
and
injustice
punishment
and
reward
in
this
life
and
in
the
life
to
come
laurentius
valla
answers
him
that
we
must
console
ourselves
for
an
ignorance
which
we
share
with
the
whole
world
just
as
one
consoles
oneself
for
not
having
the
wings
of
birds
antonio
i
know
that
you
can
give
me
those
wings
like
another
daedalus
so
that
i
may
emerge
from
the
prison
of
ignorance
and
rise
to
the
very
region
of
truth
which
is
the
homeland
of
souls
the
books
that
i
have
seen
have
not
satisfied
me
not
even
the
famous
boethius
who
meets
with
general
approval
i
know
not
whether
he
fully
understood
himself
what
he
says
of
god
understanding
and
of
eternity
superior
to
time
and
i
ask
for
your
opinion
on
his
way
of
reconciling
foreknowledge
with
freedom
laurent
i
am
fearful
of
giving
offence
to
many
people
if
i
confute
this
great
man
yet
i
will
give
preference
over
this
fear
to
the
consideration
i
have
for
the
entreaties
of
a
friend
provided
that
you
make
me
a
promise
what
it
is
that
when
you
have
dined
with
me
you
do
not
ask
me
to
give
you
supper
that
is
to
say
i
desire
that
you
be
content
with
the
answer
to
the
question
you
have
put
to
me
and
do
not
put
a
further
question
i
promise
you
here
is
the
heart
of
the
difficulty
if
god
foresaw
the
treason
of
judas
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
betray
it
was
impossible
for
him
not
to
betray
there
is
no
obligation
to
do
the
impossible
he
therefore
did
not
sin
he
did
not
deserve
to
be
punished
that
destroys
justice
and
religion
and
the
fear
of
god
god
foresaw
sin
but
he
did
not
compel
man
to
commit
it
sin
is
voluntary
that
will
was
necessary
since
it
was
foreseen
if
my
knowledge
does
not
cause
things
past
or
present
to
exist
neither
will
my
foreknowledge
cause
future
things
to
exist
that
comparison
is
deceptive
neither
the
present
nor
the
past
can
be
changed
they
are
already
necessary
but
the
future
movable
in
itself
becomes
fixed
and
necessary
through
foreknowledge
let
us
pretend
that
a
god
of
the
heathen
boasts
of
knowing
the
future
i
will
ask
him
if
he
knows
which
foot
i
shall
put
foremost
then
i
will
do
the
opposite
of
that
which
he
shall
have
foretold
this
god
knows
what
you
are
about
to
do
how
does
he
know
it
since
i
will
do
the
opposite
of
what
he
shall
have
said
and
i
suppose
that
he
will
say
what
he
thinks
your
supposition
is
false
god
will
not
answer
you
or
again
if
he
were
to
answer
you
the
veneration
you
would
have
for
him
would
make
you
hasten
to
do
what
he
had
said
his
prediction
would
be
to
you
an
order
but
we
have
changed
the
question
we
are
not
concerned
with
what
god
will
foretell
but
with
what
he
foresees
let
us
therefore
return
to
foreknowledge
and
distinguish
between
the
necessary
and
the
certain
it
is
not
impossible
for
what
is
foreseen
not
to
happen
but
it
is
infallibly
sure
that
it
will
happen
i
can
become
a
soldier
or
priest
but
i
shall
not
become
one
here
i
have
you
firmly
held
the
philosophers
rule
maintains
that
all
that
which
is
possible
can
be
considered
as
existing
but
if
that
which
you
affirm
to
be
possible
namely
an
event
different
from
what
has
been
foreseen
actually
happened
god
would
have
been
mistaken
the
rules
of
the
philosophers
are
not
oracles
for
me
this
one
in
particular
is
not
correct
two
contradictories
are
often
both
possible
can
they
also
both
exist
but
for
your
further
enlightenment
let
us
pretend
that
sextus
tarquinius
coming
to
delphi
to
consult
the
oracle
of
apollo
receives
the
answer
inopsque
cades
irata
pulsus
ab
a
beggared
outcast
of
the
city
rage
beside
a
foreign
shore
cut
short
thy
age
the
young
man
will
complain
i
have
brought
you
a
royal
gift
o
apollo
and
you
proclaim
for
me
a
lot
so
unhappy
apollo
will
say
to
him
your
gift
is
pleasing
to
me
and
i
will
do
that
which
you
ask
of
me
i
will
tell
you
what
will
happen
i
know
the
future
but
i
do
not
bring
it
about
go
make
your
complaint
to
jupiter
and
the
parcae
sextus
would
be
ridiculous
if
he
continued
thereafter
to
complain
about
apollo
is
not
that
true
he
will
say
i
thank
you
o
holy
apollo
for
not
having
repaid
me
with
silence
for
having
revealed
to
me
the
truth
but
whence
comes
it
that
jupiter
is
so
cruel
towards
me
that
he
prepares
so
hard
a
fate
for
an
innocent
man
for
a
devout
worshipper
of
the
gods
you
innocent
apollo
will
say
know
that
you
will
be
proud
that
you
will
commit
adulteries
that
you
will
be
a
traitor
to
your
country
could
sextus
reply
it
is
you
who
are
the
cause
o
apollo
you
compel
me
to
do
it
by
foreseeing
it
i
admit
that
he
would
have
taken
leave
of
his
senses
if
he
were
to
make
this
reply
therefore
neither
can
the
traitor
judas
complain
of
god
foreknowledge
and
there
is
the
answer
to
your
question
you
have
satisfied
me
beyond
my
hopes
you
have
done
what
boethius
was
not
able
to
do
i
shall
be
beholden
to
you
all
my
life
long
yet
let
us
carry
our
tale
a
little
further
sextus
will
say
no
apollo
i
will
not
do
what
you
say
what
the
god
will
say
do
you
mean
then
that
i
am
a
liar
i
repeat
to
you
once
more
you
will
do
all
that
i
have
just
said
sextus
mayhap
would
pray
the
gods
to
alter
fate
to
give
him
a
better
heart
he
would
receive
the
answer
fata
deum
flecti
sperare
he
can
not
cause
divine
foreknowledge
to
lie
but
what
then
will
sextus
say
will
he
not
break
forth
into
complaints
against
the
gods
will
he
not
say
what
i
am
then
not
free
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
follow
virtue
apollo
will
say
to
him
perhaps
know
my
poor
sextus
that
the
gods
make
each
one
as
he
is
jupiter
made
the
wolf
ravening
the
hare
timid
the
ass
stupid
and
the
lion
courageous
he
gave
you
a
soul
that
is
wicked
and
irreclaimable
you
will
act
in
conformity
with
your
natural
disposition
and
jupiter
will
treat
you
as
your
actions
shall
deserve
he
has
sworn
it
by
the
styx
i
confess
to
you
it
seems
to
me
that
apollo
in
excusing
himself
accuses
jupiter
more
than
he
accuses
sextus
and
sextus
would
answer
him
jupiter
therefore
condemns
in
me
his
own
crime
it
is
he
who
is
the
only
guilty
one
he
could
have
made
me
altogether
different
but
made
as
i
am
i
must
act
as
he
has
willed
why
then
does
he
punish
me
could
i
have
resisted
his
will
i
confess
that
i
am
brought
to
a
pause
here
as
you
are
i
have
made
the
gods
appear
on
the
scene
apollo
and
jupiter
to
make
you
distinguish
between
divine
foreknowledge
and
providence
i
have
shown
that
apollo
and
foreknowledge
do
not
impair
freedom
but
i
can
not
satisfy
you
on
the
decrees
of
jupiter
will
that
is
to
say
on
the
orders
of
providence
you
have
dragged
me
out
of
one
abyss
and
you
plunge
me
back
into
another
and
greater
abyss
remember
our
contract
i
have
given
you
dinner
and
you
ask
me
to
give
you
supper
also
now
i
discover
your
cunning
you
have
caught
me
this
is
not
an
honest
contract
what
would
you
have
me
do
i
have
given
you
wine
and
meats
from
my
home
produce
such
as
my
small
estate
can
provide
as
for
nectar
and
ambrosia
you
will
ask
the
gods
for
them
that
divine
nurture
is
not
found
among
men
let
us
hearken
to
paul
that
chosen
vessel
who
was
carried
even
to
the
third
heaven
who
heard
there
unutterable
words
he
will
answer
you
with
the
comparison
of
the
potter
with
the
incomprehensibility
of
the
ways
of
god
and
wonder
at
the
depth
of
his
wisdom
nevertheless
it
is
well
to
observe
that
one
does
not
ask
why
god
foresees
the
thing
for
that
is
understood
it
is
because
it
will
be
but
one
asks
why
he
ordains
thus
why
he
hardens
such
an
one
why
he
has
compassion
on
another
we
do
not
know
the
reasons
which
he
may
have
for
this
but
he
is
very
good
and
very
wise
that
is
enough
to
make
us
deem
that
his
reasons
are
as
he
is
just
also
it
follows
that
his
decrees
and
his
operation
do
not
destroy
our
freedom
some
men
have
sought
some
reason
therein
they
have
said
that
we
are
made
from
a
corrupt
and
impure
mass
indeed
of
mud
but
adam
and
the
angels
were
made
of
silver
and
gold
and
they
sinned
notwithstanding
one
sometimes
becomes
hardened
again
after
regeneration
we
must
therefore
seek
another
cause
for
evil
and
i
doubt
whether
even
the
angels
are
aware
of
it
yet
they
cease
not
to
be
happy
and
to
praise
god
boethius
hearkened
more
to
the
answer
of
philosophy
than
to
that
of
paul
that
was
the
cause
of
his
failure
let
us
believe
in
jesus
christ
he
is
the
virtue
and
the
wisdom
of
god
he
teaches
us
that
god
willeth
the
salvation
of
all
that
he
willeth
not
the
death
of
the
sinner
let
us
therefore
put
our
trust
in
the
divine
mercy
and
let
us
not
by
our
vanity
and
our
malice
disqualify
ourselves
to
receive
it
this
dialogue
of
valla
is
excellent
even
though
one
must
take
exception
to
some
points
in
it
but
its
chief
defect
is
that
it
cuts
the
knot
and
that
it
seems
to
condemn
providence
under
the
name
of
jupiter
making
him
almost
the
author
of
sin
let
us
therefore
carry
the
little
fable
still
further
sextus
quitting
apollo
and
delphi
seeks
out
jupiter
at
dodona
he
makes
sacrifices
and
then
he
exhibits
his
complaints
why
have
you
condemned
me
o
great
god
to
be
wicked
and
unhappy
change
my
lot
and
my
heart
or
acknowledge
your
error
jupiter
answers
him
if
you
will
renounce
rome
the
parcae
shall
spin
for
you
different
fates
you
shall
become
wise
you
shall
be
happy
sextus
why
must
i
renounce
the
hope
of
a
crown
can
i
not
come
to
be
a
good
king
jupiter
no
sextus
i
know
better
what
is
needful
for
you
if
you
go
to
rome
you
are
lost
sextus
not
being
able
to
resolve
upon
so
great
a
sacrifice
went
forth
from
the
temple
and
abandoned
himself
to
his
fate
theodorus
the
high
priest
who
had
been
present
at
the
dialogue
between
god
and
sextus
addressed
these
words
to
jupiter
your
wisdom
is
to
be
revered
o
great
ruler
of
the
gods
you
have
convinced
this
man
of
his
error
he
must
henceforth
impute
his
unhappiness
to
his
evil
will
he
has
not
a
word
to
say
but
your
faithful
worshippers
are
astonished
they
would
fain
wonder
at
your
goodness
as
well
as
at
your
greatness
it
rested
with
you
to
give
him
a
different
will
jupiter
go
to
my
daughter
pallas
she
will
inform
you
what
i
was
bound
to
do
theodorus
journeyed
to
athens
he
was
bidden
to
lie
down
to
sleep
in
the
temple
of
the
goddess
dreaming
he
found
himself
transported
into
an
unknown
country
there
stood
a
palace
of
unimaginable
splendour
and
prodigious
size
the
goddess
pallas
appeared
at
the
gate
surrounded
by
rays
of
dazzling
majesty
et
quanta
she
touched
the
face
of
theodorus
with
an
which
she
was
holding
in
her
hand
and
lo
he
had
become
able
to
confront
the
divine
radiancy
of
the
daughter
of
jupiter
and
of
all
that
she
should
show
him
jupiter
who
loves
you
she
said
to
him
has
commended
you
to
me
to
be
instructed
you
see
here
the
palace
of
the
fates
where
i
keep
watch
and
ward
here
are
representations
not
only
of
that
which
happens
but
also
of
all
that
which
is
possible
jupiter
having
surveyed
them
before
the
beginning
of
the
existing
world
classified
the
possibilities
into
worlds
and
chose
the
best
of
all
he
comes
sometimes
to
visit
these
places
to
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
recapitulating
things
and
of
renewing
his
own
choice
which
can
not
fail
to
please
him
i
have
only
to
speak
and
we
shall
see
a
whole
world
that
my
father
might
have
produced
wherein
will
be
represented
anything
that
can
be
asked
of
him
and
in
this
way
one
may
know
also
what
would
happen
if
any
particular
possibility
should
attain
unto
existence
and
whenever
the
conditions
are
not
determinate
enough
there
will
be
as
many
such
worlds
differing
from
one
another
as
one
shall
wish
which
will
answer
differently
the
same
question
in
as
many
ways
as
possible
you
learnt
geometry
in
your
youth
like
all
greeks
you
know
therefore
that
when
the
conditions
of
a
required
point
do
not
sufficiently
determine
it
and
there
is
an
infinite
number
of
them
they
all
fall
into
what
the
geometricians
call
a
locus
and
this
locus
at
least
which
is
often
a
line
will
be
determinate
thus
you
can
picture
to
yourself
an
ordered
succession
of
worlds
which
shall
contain
each
and
every
one
the
case
that
is
in
question
and
shall
vary
its
circumstances
and
its
consequences
but
if
you
put
a
case
that
differs
from
the
actual
world
only
in
one
single
definite
thing
and
in
its
results
a
certain
one
of
those
determinate
worlds
will
answer
you
these
worlds
are
all
here
that
is
in
ideas
i
will
show
you
some
wherein
shall
be
found
not
absolutely
the
same
sextus
as
you
have
seen
that
is
not
possible
he
carries
with
him
always
that
which
he
shall
be
but
several
sextuses
resembling
him
possessing
all
that
you
know
already
of
the
true
sextus
but
not
all
that
is
already
in
him
imperceptibly
nor
in
consequence
all
that
shall
yet
happen
to
him
you
will
find
in
one
world
a
very
happy
and
noble
sextus
in
another
a
sextus
content
with
a
mediocre
state
a
sextus
indeed
of
every
kind
and
endless
diversity
of
forms
thereupon
the
goddess
led
theodorus
into
one
of
the
halls
of
the
palace
when
he
was
within
it
was
no
longer
a
hall
it
was
a
world
suum
sua
sidera
at
the
command
of
pallas
there
came
within
view
dodona
with
the
temple
of
jupiter
and
sextus
issuing
thence
he
could
be
heard
saying
that
he
would
obey
the
god
and
lo
he
goes
to
a
city
lying
between
two
seas
resembling
corinth
he
buys
there
a
small
garden
cultivating
it
he
finds
a
treasure
he
becomes
a
rich
man
enjoying
affection
and
esteem
he
dies
at
a
great
age
beloved
of
the
whole
city
theodorus
saw
the
whole
life
of
sextus
as
at
one
glance
and
as
in
a
stage
presentation
there
was
a
great
volume
of
writings
in
this
hall
theodorus
could
not
refrain
from
asking
what
that
meant
it
is
the
history
of
this
world
which
we
are
now
visiting
the
goddess
told
him
it
is
the
book
of
its
fates
you
have
seen
a
number
on
the
forehead
of
sextus
look
in
this
book
for
the
place
which
it
indicates
theodorus
looked
for
it
and
found
there
the
history
of
sextus
in
a
form
more
ample
than
the
outline
he
had
seen
put
your
finger
on
any
line
you
please
pallas
said
to
him
and
you
will
see
represented
actually
in
all
its
detail
that
which
the
line
broadly
indicates
he
obeyed
and
he
saw
coming
into
view
all
the
characteristics
of
a
portion
of
the
life
of
that
sextus
they
passed
into
another
hall
and
lo
another
world
another
sextus
who
issuing
from
the
temple
and
having
resolved
to
obey
jupiter
goes
to
thrace
there
he
marries
the
daughter
of
the
king
who
had
no
other
children
he
succeeds
him
and
he
is
adored
by
his
subjects
they
went
into
other
rooms
and
always
they
saw
new
scenes
the
halls
rose
in
a
pyramid
becoming
even
more
beautiful
as
one
mounted
towards
the
apex
and
representing
more
beautiful
worlds
finally
they
reached
the
highest
one
which
completed
the
pyramid
and
which
was
the
most
beautiful
of
all
for
the
pyramid
had
a
beginning
but
one
could
not
see
its
end
it
had
an
apex
but
no
base
it
went
on
increasing
to
infinity
that
is
as
the
goddess
explained
because
amongst
an
endless
number
of
possible
worlds
there
is
the
best
of
all
else
would
god
not
have
determined
to
create
any
but
there
is
not
any
one
which
has
not
also
less
perfect
worlds
below
it
that
is
why
the
pyramid
goes
on
descending
to
infinity
theodorus
entering
this
highest
hall
became
entranced
in
ecstasy
he
had
to
receive
succour
from
the
goddess
a
drop
of
a
divine
liquid
placed
on
his
tongue
restored
him
he
was
beside
himself
for
joy
we
are
in
the
real
true
world
said
the
goddess
and
you
are
at
the
source
of
happiness
behold
what
jupiter
makes
ready
for
you
if
you
continue
to
serve
him
faithfully
here
is
sextus
as
he
is
and
as
he
will
be
in
reality
he
issues
from
the
temple
in
a
rage
he
scorns
the
counsel
of
the
gods
you
see
him
going
to
rome
bringing
confusion
everywhere
violating
the
wife
of
his
friend
there
he
is
driven
out
with
his
father
beaten
unhappy
if
jupiter
had
placed
here
a
sextus
happy
at
corinth
or
king
in
thrace
it
would
be
no
longer
this
world
and
nevertheless
he
could
not
have
failed
to
choose
this
world
which
surpasses
in
perfection
all
the
others
and
which
forms
the
apex
of
the
pyramid
else
would
jupiter
have
renounced
his
wisdom
he
would
have
banished
me
me
his
daughter
you
see
that
my
father
did
not
make
sextus
wicked
he
was
so
from
all
eternity
he
was
so
always
and
freely
my
father
only
granted
him
the
existence
which
his
wisdom
could
not
refuse
to
the
world
where
he
is
included
he
made
him
pass
from
the
region
of
the
possible
to
that
of
the
actual
beings
the
crime
of
sextus
serves
for
great
things
it
renders
rome
free
thence
will
arise
a
great
empire
which
will
show
noble
examples
to
mankind
but
that
is
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
worth
of
this
whole
world
at
whose
beauty
you
will
marvel
when
after
a
happy
passage
from
this
mortal
state
to
another
and
better
one
the
gods
shall
have
fitted
you
to
know
it
at
this
moment
theodorus
wakes
up
he
gives
thanks
to
the
goddess
he
owns
the
justice
of
jupiter
his
spirit
pervaded
by
what
he
has
seen
and
heard
he
carries
on
the
office
of
high
priest
with
all
the
zeal
of
a
true
servant
of
his
god
and
with
all
the
joy
whereof
a
mortal
is
capable
it
seems
to
me
that
this
continuation
of
the
tale
may
elucidate
the
difficulty
which
valla
did
not
wish
to
treat
if
apollo
has
represented
aright
knowledge
of
vision
that
which
concerns
beings
in
existence
i
hope
that
pallas
will
have
not
discreditably
filled
the
role
of
what
is
called
knowledge
of
simple
intelligence
that
which
embraces
all
that
is
possible
wherein
at

the

of

must
be
sought
appendices
summary
of
the
controversy
reduced
to
formal
arguments
some
persons
of
discernment
have
wished
me
to
make
this
addition
i
have
the
more
readily
deferred
to
their
opinion
because
of
the
opportunity
thereby
gained
for
meeting
certain
difficulties
and
for
making
observations
on
certain
matters
which
were
not
treated
in
sufficient
detail
in
the
work
itself
objection
i
whoever
does
not
choose
the
best
course
is
lacking
either
in
power
or
knowledge
or
goodness
god
did
not
choose
the
best
course
in
creating
this
world
therefore
god
was
lacking
in
power
or
knowledge
or
goodness
answer
i
deny
the
minor
that
is
to
say
the
second
premiss
of
this
syllogism
and
the
opponent
proves
it
by
this
prosyllogism
whoever
makes
things
in
which
there
is
evil
and
which
could
have
been
made
without
any
evil
or
need
not
have
been
made
at
all
does
not
choose
the
best
course
god
made
a
world
wherein
there
is
evil
a
world
i
say
which
could
have
been
made
without
any
evil
or
which
need
not
have
been
made
at
all
therefore
god
did
not
choose
the
best
course
answer
i
admit
the
minor
of
this
prosyllogism
for
one
must
confess
that
there
is
evil
in
this
world
which
god
has
made
and
that
it
would
have
been
possible
to
make
a
world
without
evil
or
even
not
to
create
any
world
since
its
creation
depended
upon
the
free
will
of
god
but
i
deny
the
major
that
is
the
first
of
the
two
premisses
of
the
prosyllogism
and
i
might
content
myself
with
asking
for
its
proof
in
order
however
to
give
a
clearer
exposition
of
the
matter
i
would
justify
this
denial
by
pointing
out
that
the
best
course
is
not
always
that
one
which
tends
towards
avoiding
evil
since
it
is
possible
that
the
evil
may
be
accompanied
by
a
greater
good
for
example
the
general
of
an
army
will
prefer
a
great
victory
with
a
slight
wound
to
a
state
of
affairs
without
wound
and
without
victory
i
have
proved
this
in
further
detail
in
this
work
by
pointing
out
through
instances
taken
from
mathematics
and
elsewhere
that
an
imperfection
in
the
part
may
be
required
for
a
greater
perfection
in
the
whole
i
have
followed
therein
the
opinion
of
augustine
who
said
a
hundred
times
that
god
permitted
evil
in
order
to
derive
from
it
a
good
that
is
to
say
a
greater
good
and
thomas
aquinas
says
in
libr
qu
art
that
the
permission
of
evil
tends
towards
the
good
of
the
universe
i
have
shown
that
among
older
writers
the
fall
of
adam
was
termed
a
fortunate
sin
because
it
had
been
expiated
with
immense
benefit
by
the
incarnation
of
the
son
of
god
for
he
gave
to
the
universe
something
more
noble
than
anything
there
would
otherwise
have
been
amongst
created
beings
for
the
better
understanding
of
the
matter
i
added
following
the
example
of
many
good
authors
that
it
was
consistent
with
order
and
the
general
good
for
god
to
grant
to
certain
of
his
creatures
the
opportunity
to
exercise
their
freedom
even
when
he
foresaw
that
they
would
turn
to
evil
for
god
could
easily
correct
the
evil
and
it
was
not
fitting
that
in
order
to
prevent
sin
he
should
always
act
in
an
extraordinary
way
it
will
therefore
sufficiently
refute
the
objection
to
show
that
a
world
with
evil
may
be
better
than
a
world
without
evil
but
i
have
gone
still
further
in
the
work
and
have
even
shown
that
this
universe
must
be
indeed
better
than
every
other
possible
universe
objection
ii
if
there
is
more
evil
than
good
in
intelligent
creatures
there
is
more
evil
than
good
in
all
god
work
now
there
is
more
evil
than
good
in
intelligent
creatures
therefore
there
is
more
evil
than
good
in
all
god
work
answer
i
deny
the
major
and
the
minor
of
this
conditional
syllogism
as
for
the
major
i
do
not
admit
it
because
this
supposed
inference
from
the
part
to
the
whole
from
intelligent
creatures
to
all
creatures
assumes
tacitly
and
without
proof
that
creatures
devoid
of
reason
can
not
be
compared
or
taken
into
account
with
those
that
have
reason
but
why
might
not
the
surplus
of
good
in
the
creatures
that
fill
the
world
compensate
for
and
even
exceed
incomparably
the
surplus
of
evil
in
rational
creatures
it
is
true
that
the
value
of
the
latter
is
greater
but
by
way
of
compensation
the
others
are
incomparably
greater
in
number
and
it
may
be
that
the
proportion
of
number
and
quantity
surpasses
that
of
value
and
quality
the
minor
also
i
can
not
admit
namely
that
there
is
more
evil
than
good
in
intelligent
creatures
one
need
not
even
agree
that
there
is
more
evil
than
good
in
the
human
kind
for
it
is
possible
and
even
a
very
reasonable
thing
that
the
glory
and
the
perfection
of
the
blessed
may
be
incomparably
greater
than
the
misery
and
imperfection
of
the
damned
and
that
here
the
excellence
of
the
total
good
in
the
smaller
number
may
exceed
the
total
evil
which
is
in
the
greater
number
the
blessed
draw
near
to
divinity
through
a
divine
mediator
so
far
as
can
belong
to
these
created
beings
and
make
such
progress
in
good
as
is
impossible
for
the
damned
to
make
in
evil
even
though
they
should
approach
as
nearly
as
may
be
the
nature
of
demons
god
is
infinite
and
the
devil
is
finite
good
can
and
does
go
on
whereas
evil
has
its
bounds
it
may
be
therefore
and
it
is
probable
that
there
happens
in
the
comparison
between
the
blessed
and
the
damned
the
opposite
of
what
i
said
could
happen
in
the
comparison
between
the
happy
and
the
unhappy
namely
that
in
the
latter
the
proportion
of
degrees
surpasses
that
of
numbers
while
in
the
comparison
between
intelligent
and
the
proportion
of
numbers
is
greater
than
that
of
values
one
is
justified
in
assuming
that
a
thing
may
be
so
as
long
as
one
does
not
prove
that
it
is
impossible
and
indeed
what
is
here
put
forward
goes
beyond
assumption
but
secondly
even
should
one
admit
that
there
is
more
evil
than
good
in
the
human
kind
one
still
has
every
reason
for
not
admitting
that
there
is
more
evil
than
good
in
all
intelligent
creatures
for
there
is
an
inconceivable
number
of
spirits
and
perhaps
of
other
rational
creatures
besides
and
an
opponent
can
not
prove
that
in
the
whole
city
of
god
composed
as
much
of
spirits
as
of
rational
animals
without
number
and
of
endless
different
kinds
the
evil
exceeds
the
good
although
one
need
not
in
order
to
answer
an
objection
prove
that
a
thing
is
when
its
mere
possibility
suffices
i
have
nevertheless
shown
in
this
present
work
that
it
is
a
result
of
the
supreme
perfection
of
the
sovereign
of
the
universe
that
the
kingdom
of
god
should
be
the
most
perfect
of
all
states
or
governments
possible
and
that
in
consequence
what
little
evil
there
is
should
be
required
to
provide
the
full
measure
of
the
vast
good
existing
there
objection
iii
if
it
is
always
impossible
not
to
sin
it
is
always
unjust
to
punish
now
it
is
always
impossible
not
to
sin
or
rather
all
sin
is
necessary
therefore
it
is
always
unjust
to
punish
the
minor
of
this
is
proved
as
follows
first
prosyllogism
everything
predetermined
is
necessary
every
event
is
predetermined
therefore
every
event
and
consequently
sin
also
is
necessary
again
this
second
minor
is
proved
thus
second
prosyllogism
that
which
is
future
that
which
is
foreseen
that
which
is
involved
in
causes
is
predetermined
every
event
is
of
this
kind
therefore
every
event
is
predetermined
answer
i
admit
in
a
certain
sense
the
conclusion
of
the
second
prosyllogism
which
is
the
minor
of
the
first
but
i
shall
deny
the
major
of
the
first
prosyllogism
namely
that
everything
predetermined
is
necessary
taking
say
the
necessity
to
sin
or
the
impossibility
of
not
sinning
or
of
not
doing
some
action
in
the
sense
relevant
to
the
argument
that
is
as
a
necessity
essential
and
absolute
which
destroys
the
morality
of
action
and
the
justice
of
punishment
if
anyone
meant
a
different
necessity
or
impossibility
that
is
a
necessity
only
moral
or
hypothetical
which
will
be
explained
presently
it
is
plain
that
we
would
deny
him
the
major
stated
in
the
objection
we
might
content
ourselves
with
this
answer
and
demand
the
proof
of
the
proposition
denied
but
i
am
well
pleased
to
justify
my
manner
of
procedure
in
the
present
work
in
order
to
make
the
matter
clear
and
to
throw
more
light
on
this
whole
subject
by
explaining
the
necessity
that
must
be
rejected
and
the
determination
that
must
be
allowed
the
truth
is
that
the
necessity
contrary
to
morality
which
must
be
avoided
and
which
would
render
punishment
unjust
is
an
insuperable
necessity
which
would
render
all
opposition
unavailing
even
though
one
should
wish
with
all
one
heart
to
avoid
the
necessary
action
and
though
one
should
make
all
possible
efforts
to
that
end
now
it
is
plain
that
this
is
not
applicable
to
voluntary
actions
since
one
would
not
do
them
if
one
did
not
so
desire
thus
their
prevision
and
predetermination
is
not
absolute
but
it
presupposes
will
if
it
is
certain
that
one
will
do
them
it
is
no
less
certain
that
one
will
will
to
do
them
these
voluntary
actions
and
their
results
will
not
happen
whatever
one
may
do
and
whether
one
will
them
or
not
but
they
will
happen
because
one
will
do
and
because
one
will
will
to
do
that
which
leads
to
them
that
is
involved
in
prevision
and
predetermination
and
forms
the
reason
thereof
the
necessity
of
such
events
is
called
conditional
or
hypothetical
or
again
necessity
of
consequence
because
it
presupposes
the
will
and
the
other
requisites
but
the
necessity
which
destroys
morality
and
renders
punishment
unjust
and
reward
unavailing
is
found
in
the
things
that
will
be
whatever
one
may
do
and
whatever
one
may
will
to
do
in
a
word
it
exists
in
that
which
is
essential
this
it
is
which
is
called
an
absolute
necessity
thus
it
avails
nothing
with
regard
to
what
is
necessary
absolutely
to
ordain
interdicts
or
commandments
to
propose
penalties
or
prizes
to
blame
or
to
praise
it
will
come
to
pass
no
more
and
no
less
in
voluntary
actions
on
the
contrary
and
in
what
depends
upon
them
precepts
armed
with
power
to
punish
and
to
reward
very
often
serve
and
are
included
in
the
order
of
causes
that
make
action
exist
thus
it
comes
about
that
not
only
pains
and
effort
but
also
prayers
are
effective
god
having
had
even
these
prayers
in
mind
before
he
ordered
things
and
having
made
due
allowance
for
them
that
is
why
the
precept
et
pray
and
work
remains
intact
thus
not
only
those
who
under
the
empty
pretext
of
the
necessity
of
events
maintain
that
one
can
spare
oneself
the
pains
demanded
by
affairs
but
also
those
who
argue
against
prayers
fall
into
that
which
the
ancients
even
in
their
time
called
lazy
sophism
so
the
predetermination
of
events
by
their
causes
is
precisely
what
contributes
to
morality
instead
of
destroying
it
and
the
causes
incline
the
will
without
necessitating
it
for
this
reason
the
determination
we
are
concerned
with
is
not
a
necessitation
it
is
certain
to
him
who
knows
all
that
the
effect
will
follow
this
inclination
but
this
effect
does
not
follow
thence
by
a
consequence
which
is
necessary
that
is
whose
contrary
implies
contradiction
and
it
is
also
by
such
an
inward
inclination
that
the
will
is
determined
without
the
presence
of
necessity
suppose
that
one
has
the
greatest
possible
passion
for
example
a
great
thirst
you
will
admit
that
the
soul
can
find
some
reason
for
resisting
it
even
if
it
were
only
that
of
displaying
its
power
thus
though
one
may
never
have
complete
indifference
of
equipoise
and
there
is
always
a
predominance
of
inclination
for
the
course
adopted
that
predominance
does
not
render
absolutely
necessary
the
resolution
taken
objection
iv
whoever
can
prevent
the
sin
of
others
and
does
not
so
but
rather
contributes
to
it
although
he
be
fully
apprised
of
it
is
accessary
thereto
god
can
prevent
the
sin
of
intelligent
creatures
but
he
does
not
so
and
he
rather
contributes
to
it
by
his
and
by
the
opportunities
he
causes
although
he
is
fully
cognizant
of
it
therefore
etc
answer
i
deny
the
major
of
this
syllogism
it
may
be
that
one
can
prevent
the
sin
but
that
one
ought
not
to
do
so
because
one
could
not
do
so
without
committing
a
sin
oneself
or
when
god
is
concerned
without
acting
unreasonably
i
have
given
instances
of
that
and
have
applied
them
to
god
himself
it
may
be
also
that
one
contributes
to
the
evil
and
that
one
even
opens
the
way
to
it
sometimes
in
doing
things
one
is
bound
to
do
and
when
one
does
one
duty
or
speaking
of
god
when
after
full
consideration
one
does
that
which
reason
demands
one
is
not
responsible
for
events
even
when
one
foresees
them
one
does
not
will
these
evils
but
one
is
willing
to
permit
them
for
a
greater
good
which
one
can
not
in
reason
help
preferring
to
other
considerations
this
is
a
will
resulting
from
acts
of
will
in
which
one
wills
the
good
i
know
that
some
persons
in
speaking
of
the
antecedent
and
consequent
will
of
god
have
meant
by
the
antecedent
that
which
wills
that
all
men
be
saved
and
by
the
consequent
that
which
wills
in
consequence
of
persistent
sin
that
there
be
some
damned
damnation
being
a
result
of
sin
but
these
are
only
examples
of
a
more
general
notion
and
one
may
say
with
the
same
reason
that
god
wills
by
his
antecedent
will
that
men
sin
not
and
that
by
his
consequent
or
final
and
decretory
will
which
is
always
followed
by
its
effect
he
wills
to
permit
that
they
sin
this
permission
being
a
result
of
superior
reasons
one
has
indeed
justification
for
saying
in
general
that
the
antecedent
will
of
god
tends
towards
the
production
of
good
and
the
prevention
of
evil
each
taken
in
itself
and
as
it
were
detached
et
secundum
i
qu
art
according
to
the
measure
of
the
degree
of
each
good
or
of
each
evil
likewise
one
may
say
that
the
consequent
or
final
and
total
divine
will
tends
towards
the
production
of
as
many
goods
as
can
be
put
together
whose
combination
thereby
becomes
determined
and
involves
also
the
permission
of
some
evils
and
the
exclusion
of
some
goods
as
the
best
possible
plan
of
the
universe
demands
arminius
in
his
explained
very
well
that
the
will
of
god
can
be
called
consequent
not
only
in
relation
to
the
action
of
the
creature
considered
beforehand
in
the
divine
understanding
but
also
in
relation
to
other
anterior
acts
of
divine
will
but
it
is
enough
to
consider
the
passage
cited
from
thomas
aquinas
and
that
from
scotus
i
dist
qu
to
see
that
they
make
this
distinction
as
i
have
made
it
here
nevertheless
if
anyone
will
not
suffer
this
use
of
the
terms
let
him
put
in
place
of
will
and
or
in
place
of
will
for
i
do
not
wish
to
wrangle
about
words
objection
v
whoever
produces
all
that
is
real
in
a
thing
is
its
cause
god
produces
all
that
is
real
in
sin
therefore
god
is
the
cause
of
sin
answer
i
might
content
myself
with
denying
the
major
or
the
minor
because
the
term
admits
of
interpretations
capable
of
rendering
these
propositions
false
but
in
order
to
give
a
better
explanation
i
will
make
a
distinction
either
signifies
that
which
is
positive
only
or
else
it
includes
also
privative
beings
in
the
first
case
i
deny
the
major
and
i
admit
the
minor
in
the
second
case
i
do
the
opposite
i
might
have
confined
myself
to
that
but
i
was
willing
to
go
further
in
order
to
account
for
this
distinction
i
have
therefore
been
well
pleased
to
point
out
that
every
purely
positive
or
absolute
reality
is
a
perfection
and
that
every
imperfection
comes
from
limitation
that
is
from
the
privative
for
to
limit
is
to
withhold
extension
or
the
more
beyond
now
god
is
the
cause
of
all
perfections
and
consequently
of
all
realities
when
they
are
regarded
as
purely
positive
but
limitations
or
privations
result
from
the
original
imperfection
of
creatures
which
restricts
their
receptivity
it
is
as
with
a
laden
boat
which
the
river
carries
along
more
slowly
or
less
slowly
in
proportion
to
the
weight
that
it
bears
thus
the
speed
comes
from
the
river
but
the
retardation
which
restricts
this
speed
comes
from
the
load
also
i
have
shown
in
the
present
work
how
the
creature
in
causing
sin
is
a
deficient
cause
how
errors
and
evil
inclinations
spring
from
privation
and
how
privation
is
efficacious
accidentally
and
i
have
justified
the
opinion
of
augustine
lib
i
qu
who
explains
for
example
how
god
hardens
the
soul
not
in
giving
it
something
evil
but
because
the
effect
of
the
good
he
imprints
is
restricted
by
the
resistance
of
the
soul
and
by
the
circumstances
contributing
to
this
resistance
so
that
he
does
not
give
it
all
the
good
that
would
overcome
its
evil
inquit
ab
illo
erogatur
aliquid
quo
homo
fit
deterior
sed
tantum
quo
fit
melior
non
erogatur
but
if
god
had
willed
to
do
more
here
he
must
needs
have
produced
either
fresh
natures
in
his
creatures
or
fresh
miracles
to
change
their
natures
and
this
the
best
plan
did
not
allow
it
is
just
as
if
the
current
of
the
river
must
needs
be
more
rapid
than
its
slope
permits
or
the
boats
themselves
be
less
laden
if
they
had
to
be
impelled
at
a
greater
speed
so
the
limitation
or
original
imperfection
of
creatures
brings
it
about
that
even
the
best
plan
of
the
universe
can
not
admit
more
good
and
can
not
be
exempted
from
certain
evils
these
however
being
only
of
such
a
kind
as
may
tend
towards
a
greater
good
there
are
some
disorders
in
the
parts
which
wonderfully
enhance
the
beauty
of
the
whole
just
as
certain
dissonances
appropriately
used
render
harmony
more
beautiful
but
that
depends
upon
the
answer
which
i
have
already
given
to
the
first
objection
objection
vi
whoever
punishes
those
who
have
done
as
well
as
it
was
in
their
power
to
do
is
unjust
god
does
so
therefore
etc
answer
i
deny
the
minor
of
this
argument
and
i
believe
that
god
always
gives
sufficient
aid
and
grace
to
those
who
have
good
will
that
is
to
say
who
do
not
reject
this
grace
by
a
fresh
sin
thus
i
do
not
admit
the
damnation
of
children
dying
unbaptized
or
outside
the
church
or
the
damnation
of
adult
persons
who
have
acted
according
to
the
light
that
god
has
given
them
and
i
believe
that
anyone
has
followed
the
light
he
he
will
undoubtedly
receive
thereof
in
greater
measure
as
he
has
need
even
as
the
late
herr
hulsemann
who
was
celebrated
as
a
profound
theologian
at
leipzig
has
somewhere
observed
and
if
such
a
man
had
failed
to
receive
light
during
his
life
he
would
receive
it
at
least
in
the
hour
of
death
objection
vii
whoever
gives
only
to
some
and
not
to
all
the
means
of
producing
effectively
in
them
good
will
and
final
saving
faith
has
not
enough
goodness
god
does
so
therefore
etc
answer
i
deny
the
major
it
is
true
that
god
could
overcome
the
greatest
resistance
of
the
human
heart
and
indeed
he
sometimes
does
so
whether
by
an
inward
grace
or
by
the
outward
circumstances
that
can
greatly
influence
souls
but
he
does
not
always
do
so
whence
comes
this
distinction
someone
will
say
and
wherefore
does
his
goodness
appear
to
be
restricted
the
truth
is
that
it
would
not
have
been
in
order
always
to
act
in
an
extraordinary
way
and
to
derange
the
connexion
of
things
as
i
have
observed
already
in
answering
the
first
objection
the
reasons
for
this
connexion
whereby
the
one
is
placed
in
more
favourable
circumstances
than
the
other
are
hidden
in
the
depths
of
god
wisdom
they
depend
upon
the
universal
harmony
the
best
plan
of
the
universe
which
god
could
not
fail
to
choose
required
this
one
concludes
thus
from
the
event
itself
since
god
made
the
universe
it
was
not
possible
to
do
better
such
management
far
from
being
contrary
to
goodness
has
rather
been
prompted
by
supreme
goodness
itself
this
objection
with
its
solution
might
have
been
inferred
from
what
was
said
with
regard
to
the
first
objection
but
it
seemed
advisable
to
touch
upon
it
separately
objection
viii
whoever
can
not
fail
to
choose
the
best
is
not
free
god
can
not
fail
to
choose
the
best
therefore
god
is
not
free
answer
i
deny
the
major
of
this
argument
rather
is
it
true
freedom
and
the
most
perfect
to
be
able
to
make
the
best
use
of
one
free
will
and
always
to
exercise
this
power
without
being
turned
aside
either
by
outward
force
or
by
inward
passions
whereof
the
one
enslaves
our
bodies
and
the
other
our
souls
there
is
nothing
less
servile
and
more
befitting
the
highest
degree
of
freedom
than
to
be
always
led
towards
the
good
and
always
by
one
own
inclination
without
any
constraint
and
without
any
displeasure
and
to
object
that
god
therefore
had
need
of
external
things
is
only
a
sophism
he
creates
them
freely
but
when
he
had
set
before
him
an
end
that
of
exercising
his
goodness
his
wisdom
determined
him
to
choose
the
means
most
appropriate
for
obtaining
this
end
to
call
that
a
is
to
take
the
term
in
a
sense
not
usual
which
clears
it
of
all
imperfection
somewhat
as
one
does
when
speaking
of
the
wrath
of
god
seneca
says
somewhere
that
god
commanded
only
once
but
that
he
obeys
always
because
he
obeys
the
laws
that
he
willed
to
ordain
for
himself
jussit
semper
but
he
had
better
have
said
that
god
always
commands
and
that
he
is
always
obeyed
for
in
willing
he
always
follows
the
tendency
of
his
own
nature
and
all
other
things
always
follow
his
will
and
as
this
will
is
always
the
same
one
can
not
say
that
he
obeys
that
will
only
which
he
formerly
had
nevertheless
although
his
will
is
always
indefectible
and
always
tends
towards
the
best
the
evil
or
the
lesser
good
which
he
rejects
will
still
be
possible
in
itself
otherwise
the
necessity
of
good
would
be
geometrical
so
to
speak
or
metaphysical
and
altogether
absolute
the
contingency
of
things
would
be
destroyed
and
there
would
be
no
choice
but
necessity
of
this
kind
which
does
not
destroy
the
possibility
of
the
contrary
has
the
name
by
analogy
only
it
becomes
effective
not
through
the
mere
essence
of
things
but
through
that
which
is
outside
them
and
above
them
that
is
through
the
will
of
god
this
necessity
is
called
moral
because
for
the
wise
what
is
necessary
and
what
is
owing
are
equivalent
things
and
when
it
is
always
followed
by
its
effect
as
it
indeed
is
in
the
perfectly
wise
that
is
in
god
one
can
say
that
it
is
a
happy
necessity
the
more
nearly
creatures
approach
this
the
closer
do
they
come
to
perfect
felicity
moreover
necessity
of
this
kind
is
not
the
necessity
one
endeavours
to
avoid
and
which
destroys
morality
reward
and
commendation
for
that
which
it
brings
to
pass
does
not
happen
whatever
one
may
do
and
whatever
one
may
will
but
because
one
desires
it
a
will
to
which
it
is
natural
to
choose
well
deserves
most
to
be
commended
and
it
carries
with
it
its
own
reward
which
is
supreme
happiness
and
as
this
constitution
of
the
divine
nature
gives
an
entire
satisfaction
to
him
who
possesses
it
it
is
also
the
best
and
the
most
desirable
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
creatures
who
are
all
dependent
upon
god
if
the
will
of
god
had
not
as
its
rule
the
principle
of
the
best
it
would
tend
towards
evil
which
would
be
worst
of
all
or
else
it
would
be
indifferent
somehow
to
good
and
to
evil
and
guided
by
chance
but
a
will
that
would
always
drift
along
at
random
would
scarcely
be
any
better
for
the
government
of
the
universe
than
the
fortuitous
concourse
of
corpuscles
without
the
existence
of
divinity
and
even
though
god
should
abandon
himself
to
chance
only
in
some
cases
and
in
a
certain
way
as
he
would
if
he
did
not
always
tend
entirely
towards
the
best
and
if
he
were
capable
of
preferring
a
lesser
good
to
a
greater
good
that
is
an
evil
to
a
good
since
that
which
prevents
a
greater
good
is
an
evil
he
would
be
no
less
imperfect
than
the
object
of
his
choice
then
he
would
not
deserve
absolute
trust
he
would
act
without
reason
in
such
a
case
and
the
government
of
the
universe
would
be
like
certain
games
equally
divided
between
reason
and
luck
this
all
proves
that
this
objection
which
is
made
against
the
choice
of
the
best
perverts
the
notions
of
free
and
necessary
and
represents
the
best
to
us
actually
as
evil
but
that
is
either
malicious
or
absurd
excursus
on
theodicy
published
by
the
author
in
mémoires
de
trévoux
july
i
said
in
my
essays
that
i
wished
to
see
the
demonstrations
mentioned
by
bayle
and
contained
in
the
sixth
letter
printed
at
trévoux
in
father
des
bosses
has
shown
me
this
letter
in
which
the
writer
essays
to
demonstrate
by
the
geometrical
method
that
god
is
the
sole
true
cause
of
all
that
is
real
my
perusal
of
it
has
confirmed
me
in
the
opinion
which
i
indicated
in
the
same
passage
namely
that
this
proposition
can
be
true
in
a
very
good
sense
god
being
the
only
cause
of
pure
and
absolute
realities
or
perfections
but
when
one
includes
limitations
or
privations
under
the
name
of
realities
one
can
say
that
second
causes
in
the
production
of
what
is
limited
and
that
otherwise
god
would
be
the
cause
of
sin
and
even
its
sole
cause
and
i
am
somewhat
inclined
to
think
that
the
gifted
author
of
the
letter
does
not
greatly
differ
in
opinion
from
me
although
he
seems
to
include
all
modalities
among
the
realities
of
which
he
declares
god
to
be
the
sole
cause
for
in
actual
fact
i
think
he
will
not
admit
that
god
is
the
cause
and
the
author
of
sin
indeed
he
explains
himself
in
a
manner
which
seems
to
overthrow
his
thesis
and
to
grant
real
action
to
creatures
for
in
the
proof
of
the
eighth
corollary
of
his
second
proposition
these
words
occur
natural
motion
of
the
soul
although
determinate
in
itself
is
indeterminate
in
respect
of
its
objects
for
it
is
love
of
good
in
general
it
is
through
the
ideas
of
good
appearing
in
individual
objects
that
this
motion
becomes
individual
and
determinate
in
relation
to
those
objects
and
thus
as
the
mind
has
the
power
of
varying
its
own
ideas
it
can
also
change
the
determinations
of
its
love
and
for
that
purpose
it
is
not
necessary
that
it
overcome
the
power
of
god
or
oppose
his
action
these
determinations
of
motion
towards
individual
objects
are
not
invincible
it
is
this
noninvincibility
which
causes
the
mind
to
be
free
and
capable
of
changing
them
but
after
all
the
mind
makes
these
changes
only
through
the
motion
which
god
gives
to
it
and
conserves
for
it
in
my
own
style
i
would
have
said
that
the
perfection
which
is
in
the
action
of
the
creature
comes
from
god
but
that
the
limitations
to
be
found
there
are
a
consequence
of
the
original
limitation
and
the
preceding
limitations
that
occurred
in
the
creature
further
this
is
so
not
only
in
minds
but
also
in
all
other
substances
which
thereby
are
causes
in
the
change
which
comes
to
pass
in
themselves
for
this
determination
of
which
the
author
speaks
is
nothing
but
a
limitation
now
if
after
that
one
reviews
all
the
demonstrations
or
corollaries
of
the
letter
one
will
be
able
to
admit
or
reject
the
majority
of
its
assertions
in
accordance
with
the
interpretation
one
may
make
of
them
if
by
one
means
only
perfections
or
positive
realities
god
is
the
only
true
cause
but
if
that
which
involves
limitations
is
included
under
the
realities
one
will
deny
a
considerable
portion
of
the
theses
and
the
author
himself
will
have
shown
us
the
example
it
is
in
order
to
render
the
matter
more
comprehensible
that
i
used
in
the
essays
the
example
of
a
laden
boat
which
the
more
laden
it
is
is
the
more
slowly
carried
along
by
the
stream
there
one
sees
clearly
that
the
stream
is
the
cause
of
what
is
positive
in
this
motion
of
the
perfection
the
force
the
speed
of
the
boat
but
that
the
load
is
the
cause
of
the
restriction
of
this
force
and
that
it
brings
about
the
retardation
it
is
praiseworthy
in
anyone
to
attempt
to
apply
the
geometrical
method
to
metaphysical
matters
but
it
must
be
admitted
that
hitherto
success
has
seldom
been
attained
and
descartes
himself
with
all
that
very
great
skill
which
one
can
not
deny
in
him
never
perhaps
had
less
success
than
when
he
essayed
to
do
this
in
one
of
his
answers
to
objections
for
in
mathematics
it
is
easier
to
succeed
because
numbers
figures
and
calculations
make
good
the
defects
concealed
in
words
but
in
metaphysics
where
one
is
deprived
of
this
aid
at
least
in
ordinary
argumentation
the
strictness
employed
in
the
form
of
the
argument
and
in
the
exact
definitions
of
the
terms
must
needs
supply
this
lack
but
in
neither
argument
nor
definition
is
that
strictness
here
to
be
seen
the
author
of
the
letter
who
undoubtedly
displays
much
ardour
and
penetration
sometimes
goes
a
little
too
far
as
when
he
claims
to
prove
that
there
is
as
much
reality
and
force
in
rest
as
in
motion
according
to
the
fifth
corollary
of
the
second
proposition
he
asserts
that
the
will
of
god
is
no
less
positive
in
rest
than
in
motion
and
that
it
is
not
less
invincible
be
it
so
but
does
it
follow
that
there
is
as
much
reality
and
force
in
each
of
the
two
i
do
not
see
this
conclusion
and
with
the
same
argument
one
would
prove
that
there
is
as
much
force
in
a
strong
motion
as
in
a
weak
motion
god
in
willing
rest
wills
that
the
body
be
at
the
place
a
where
it
was
immediately
before
and
for
that
it
suffices
that
there
be
no
reason
to
prompt
god
to
the
change
but
when
god
wills
that
afterwards
the
body
be
at
the
place
b
there
must
needs
be
a
new
reason
of
such
a
kind
as
to
determine
god
to
will
that
it
be
in
b
and
not
in
c
or
in
any
other
place
and
that
it
be
there
more
or
less
promptly
it
is
upon
these
reasons
the
volitions
of
god
that
we
must
assess
the
force
and
the
reality
existent
in
things
the
author
speaks
much
of
the
will
of
god
but
he
does
not
speak
much
in
this
letter
of
the
reasons
which
prompt
god
to
will
and
upon
which
all
depends
and
these
reasons
are
taken
from
the
objects
i
observe
first
indeed
with
regard
to
the
second
corollary
of
the
first
proposition
that
it
is
very
true
but
that
it
is
not
very
well
proven
the
writer
affirms
that
if
god
only
ceased
to
will
the
existence
of
a
being
that
being
would
no
longer
exist
and
here
is
the
proof
given
word
for
word
that
which
exists
only
by
the
will
of
god
no
longer
exists
once
that
will
has
ceased
but
that
is
what
must
be
proved
the
writer
endeavours
to
prove
it
by
adding
the
cause
you
remove
the
effect
this
maxim
ought
to
have
been
placed
among
the
axioms
which
are
stated
at
the
beginning
but
unhappily
this
axiom
may
be
reckoned
among
those
rules
of
philosophy
which
are
subject
to
many
exceptions
by
the
preceding
proposition
and
by
its
first
corollary
no
being
exists
save
by
the
will
of
god
therefore
etc
there
is
ambiguity
in
this
expression
that
nothing
exists
save
by
the
will
of
god
if
one
means
that
things
begin
to
exist
only
through
this
will
one
is
justified
in
referring
to
the
preceding
propositions
but
if
one
means
that
the
existence
of
things
is
at
all
times
a
consequence
of
the
will
of
god
one
assumes
more
or
less
what
is
in
question
therefore
it
was
necessary
to
prove
first
that
the
existence
of
things
depends
upon
the
will
of
god
and
that
it
is
not
only
a
mere
effect
of
that
will
but
a
dependence
in
proportion
to
the
perfection
which
things
contain
and
once
that
is
assumed
they
will
depend
upon
will
no
less
afterwards
than
at
the
beginning
that
is
the
way
i
have
taken
the
matter
in
my
essays
nevertheless
i
recognize
that
the
letter
upon
which
i
have
just
made
observations
is
admirable
and
well
deserving
of
perusal
and
that
it
contains
noble
and
true
sentiments
provided
it
be
taken
in
the
sense
i
have
just
indicated
and
arguments
in
this
form
may
serve
as
an
introduction
to
meditations
somewhat
more
advanced
reflexions
on
the
work
that
hobbes
published
in
english
on
necessity
and
as
the
question
of
necessity
and
freedom
with
other
questions
depending
thereon
was
at
one
time
debated
between
the
famous
hobbes
and
john
bramhall
bishop
of
derry
in
books
published
by
each
of
them
i
have
deemed
it
appropriate
to
give
a
clear
account
of
them
although
i
have
already
mentioned
them
more
than
once
and
this
all
the
more
since
these
writings
of
hobbes
have
hitherto
only
appeared
in
english
and
since
the
works
of
this
author
usually
contain
something
good
and
ingenious
the
bishop
of
derry
and
hobbes
having
met
in
paris
at
the
house
of
the
marquis
afterwards
duke
of
newcastle
in
the
year
entered
into
a
discussion
on
this
subject
the
dispute
was
conducted
with
extreme
restraint
but
the
bishop
shortly
afterwards
sent
a
note
to
my
lord
newcastle
desiring
him
to
induce
hobbes
to
answer
it
he
answered
but
at
the
same
time
he
expressed
a
wish
that
his
answer
should
not
be
published
because
he
believed
it
possible
for
persons
to
abuse
dogmas
such
as
his
however
true
they
might
be
it
so
happened
however
that
hobbes
himself
passed
it
to
a
french
friend
and
allowed
a
young
englishman
to
translate
it
into
french
for
the
benefit
of
this
friend
this
young
man
kept
a
copy
of
the
english
original
and
published
it
later
in
england
without
the
author
knowledge
thus
the
bishop
was
obliged
to
reply
to
it
and
hobbes
to
make
a
rejoinder
and
to
publish
all
the
pieces
together
in
a
book
of
pages
printed
in
london
in
the
year
in
entitled
concerning
freedom
necessity
and
chance
elucidated
and
discussed
between
doctor
bramhall
bishop
of
derry
and
thomas
hobbes
of
there
is
a
later
edition
of
the
year
in
a
work
entitled
where
are
to
be
found
his
book
on
human
nature
his
treatise
on
the
body
politic
and
his
treatise
on
freedom
and
necessity
but
the
latter
does
not
contain
the
bishop
reply
nor
the
author
rejoinder
hobbes
argues
on
this
subject
with
his
usual
wit
and
subtlety
but
it
is
a
pity
that
in
both
the
one
and
the
other
we
stumble
upon
petty
tricks
such
as
arise
in
excitement
over
the
game
the
bishop
speaks
with
much
vehemence
and
behaves
somewhat
arrogantly
hobbes
for
his
part
is
not
disposed
to
spare
the
other
and
manifests
rather
too
much
scorn
for
theology
and
for
the
terminology
of
the
schoolmen
which
is
apparently
favoured
by
the
bishop
one
must
confess
that
there
is
something
strange
and
indefensible
in
the
opinions
of
hobbes
he
maintains
that
doctrines
touching
the
divinity
depend
entirely
upon
the
determination
of
the
sovereign
and
that
god
is
no
more
the
cause
of
the
good
than
of
the
bad
actions
of
creatures
he
maintains
that
all
that
which
god
does
is
just
because
there
is
none
above
him
with
power
to
punish
and
constrain
him
yet
he
speaks
sometimes
as
if
what
is
said
about
god
were
only
compliments
that
is
to
say
expressions
proper
for
paying
him
honour
but
not
for
knowing
him
he
testifies
also
that
it
seems
to
him
that
the
pains
of
the
wicked
must
end
in
their
destruction
this
opinion
closely
approaches
that
of
the
socinians
but
it
seems
that
hobbes
goes
much
further
his
philosophy
which
asserts
that
bodies
alone
are
substances
hardly
appears
favourable
to
the
providence
of
god
and
the
immortality
of
the
soul
on
other
subjects
nevertheless
he
says
very
reasonable
things
he
shows
clearly
that
nothing
comes
about
by
chance
or
rather
that
chance
only
signifies
the
ignorance
of
causes
that
produce
the
effect
and
that
for
each
effect
there
must
be
a
concurrence
of
all
the
sufficient
conditions
anterior
to
the
event
not
one
of
which
manifestly
can
be
lacking
when
the
event
is
to
follow
because
they
are
conditions
the
event
moreover
does
not
fail
to
follow
when
these
conditions
exist
all
together
because
they
are
sufficient
conditions
all
which
amounts
to
the
same
as
i
have
said
so
many
times
that
everything
comes
to
pass
as
a
result
of
determining
reasons
the
knowledge
whereof
if
we
had
it
would
make
us
know
at
the
same
time
why
the
thing
has
happened
and
why
it
did
not
go
otherwise
but
this
author
humour
which
prompts
him
to
paradoxes
and
makes
him
seek
to
contradict
others
has
made
him
draw
out
exaggerated
and
odious
conclusions
and
expressions
as
if
everything
happened
through
an
absolute
necessity
the
bishop
of
derry
on
the
other
hand
has
aptly
observed
in
the
answer
to
article
page
that
there
results
only
a
hypothetical
necessity
such
as
we
all
grant
to
events
in
relation
to
the
foreknowledge
of
god
while
hobbes
maintains
that
even
divine
foreknowledge
alone
would
be
sufficient
to
establish
an
absolute
necessity
of
events
this
was
also
the
opinion
of
wyclif
and
even
of
luther
when
he
wrote
servo
or
at
least
they
spoke
so
but
it
is
sufficiently
acknowledged
that
this
kind
of
necessity
which
is
termed
hypothetical
and
springs
from
foreknowledge
or
from
other
anterior
reasons
has
nothing
in
it
to
arouse
one
alarm
whereas
it
would
be
quite
otherwise
if
the
thing
were
necessary
of
itself
in
such
a
way
that
the
contrary
implied
contradiction
hobbes
refuses
to
listen
to
anything
about
a
moral
necessity
either
on
the
ground
that
everything
really
happens
through
physical
causes
but
one
is
nevertheless
justified
in
making
a
great
difference
between
the
necessity
which
constrains
the
wise
to
do
good
and
which
is
termed
moral
existing
even
in
relation
to
god
and
that
blind
necessity
whereby
according
to
epicurus
strato
spinoza
and
perhaps
hobbes
things
exist
without
intelligence
and
without
choice
and
consequently
without
god
indeed
there
would
according
to
them
be
no
need
of
god
since
in
consequence
of
this
necessity
all
would
have
existence
through
its
own
essence
just
as
necessarily
as
two
and
three
make
five
and
this
necessity
is
absolute
because
everything
it
carries
with
it
must
happen
whatever
one
may
do
whereas
what
happens
by
a
hypothetical
necessity
happens
as
a
result
of
the
supposition
that
this
or
that
has
been
foreseen
or
resolved
or
done
beforehand
and
moral
necessity
contains
an
obligation
imposed
by
reason
which
is
always
followed
by
its
effect
in
the
wise
this
kind
of
necessity
is
happy
and
desirable
when
one
is
prompted
by
good
reasons
to
act
as
one
does
but
necessity
blind
and
absolute
would
subvert
piety
and
morality
there
is
more
reason
in
hobbes
discourse
when
he
admits
that
our
actions
are
in
our
power
so
that
we
do
that
which
we
will
when
we
have
the
power
to
do
it
and
when
there
is
no
hindrance
he
asserts
notwithstanding
that
our
volitions
themselves
are
not
so
within
our
power
that
we
can
give
ourselves
without
difficulty
and
according
to
our
good
pleasure
inclinations
and
wills
which
we
might
desire
the
bishop
does
not
appear
to
have
taken
notice
of
this
reflexion
which
hobbes
also
does
not
develop
enough
the
truth
is
that
we
have
some
power
also
over
our
volitions
but
obliquely
and
not
absolutely
and
indifferently
this
has
been
explained
in
some
passages
of
this
work
finally
hobbes
shows
like
others
before
him
that
the
certainty
of
events
and
necessity
itself
if
there
were
any
in
the
way
our
actions
depend
upon
causes
would
not
prevent
us
from
employing
deliberations
exhortations
blame
and
praise
punishments
and
rewards
for
these
are
of
service
and
prompt
men
to
produce
actions
or
to
refrain
from
them
thus
if
human
actions
were
necessary
they
would
be
so
through
these
means
but
the
truth
is
that
since
these
actions
are
not
necessary
absolutely
whatever
one
may
do
these
means
contribute
only
to
render
the
actions
determinate
and
certain
as
they
are
indeed
for
their
nature
shows
that
they
are
not
subject
to
an
absolute
necessity
he
gives
also
a
good
enough
notion
of
in
so
far
as
it
is
taken
in
a
general
sense
common
to
intelligent
and
substances
he
states
that
a
thing
is
deemed
free
when
the
power
which
it
has
is
not
impeded
by
an
external
thing
thus
the
water
that
is
dammed
by
a
dyke
has
the
power
to
spread
but
not
the
freedom
on
the
other
hand
it
has
not
the
power
to
rise
above
the
dyke
although
nothing
would
prevent
it
then
from
spreading
and
although
nothing
from
outside
prevents
it
from
rising
so
high
to
that
end
it
would
be
necessary
that
the
water
itself
should
come
from
a
higher
point
or
that
the
should
be
raised
by
an
increased
flow
thus
a
prisoner
lacks
the
freedom
while
a
sick
man
lacks
the
power
to
go
his
way
there
is
in
hobbes
preface
an
abstract
of
the
disputed
points
which
i
will
give
here
adding
some
expression
of
opinion
one
he
says
the
assertion
is
made
it
is
not
in
the
present
power
of
man
to
choose
for
himself
the
will
that
he
should
have
that
is
said
especially
in
relation
to
present
will
men
choose
the
objects
through
will
but
they
do
not
choose
their
present
wills
which
spring
from
reasons
and
dispositions
it
is
true
however
that
one
can
seek
new
reasons
for
oneself
and
with
time
give
oneself
new
dispositions
and
by
this
means
one
can
also
obtain
for
oneself
a
will
which
one
had
not
and
could
not
have
given
oneself
forthwith
it
is
to
use
the
comparison
hobbes
himself
uses
as
with
hunger
or
with
thirst
at
the
present
it
does
not
rest
with
my
will
to
be
hungry
or
not
but
it
rests
with
my
will
to
eat
or
not
to
eat
yet
for
the
time
to
come
it
rests
with
me
to
be
hungry
or
to
prevent
myself
from
being
so
at
such
and
such
an
hour
of
day
by
eating
beforehand
in
this
way
it
is
possible
often
to
avoid
an
evil
will
even
though
hobbes
states
in
his
reply
no
that
it
is
the
manner
of
laws
to
say
you
must
do
or
you
must
not
do
this
but
that
there
is
no
law
saying
you
must
will
or
you
must
not
will
it
yet
it
is
clear
that
he
is
mistaken
in
regard
to
the
law
of
god
which
says
thou
shalt
not
covet
it
is
true
that
this
prohibition
does
not
concern
the
first
motions
which
are
involuntary
it
is
asserted
hazard
in
english
in
latin
nothing
that
is
that
nothing
is
produced
without
cause
or
reason
very
i
admit
it
if
one
thereby
intends
a
real
hazard
for
fortune
and
hazard
are
only
appearances
which
spring
from
ignorance
of
causes
or
from
disregard
of
them
all
events
have
their
necessary
causes
they
have
their
determining
causes
whereby
one
can
account
for
them
but
these
are
not
necessary
causes
the
contrary
might
have
happened
without
implying
contradiction
the
will
of
god
makes
the
necessity
of
all
things
the
will
of
god
produces
only
contingent
things
which
could
have
gone
differently
since
time
space
and
matter
are
indifferent
with
regard
to
all
kinds
of
shape
and
movement
the
other
according
to
hobbes
it
is
asserted
man
is
free
absolutely
not
only
choose
what
he
wills
to
do
but
also
to
choose
what
he
wills
to
will
that
is
said
one
is
not
absolute
master
of
one
will
to
change
it
forthwith
without
making
use
of
some
means
or
skill
for
that
purpose
man
wills
a
good
action
the
will
of
god
with
his
otherwise
not
that
is
said
provided
one
means
that
god
does
not
will
evil
actions
although
he
wills
to
permit
them
to
prevent
the
occurrence
of
something
which
would
be
worse
than
these
sins
the
will
can
choose
whether
it
wills
to
will
or
not
with
regard
to
present
volition
things
happen
without
necessity
by
chance
what
happens
without
necessity
does
not
because
of
that
happen
by
chance
that
is
to
say
without
causes
and
reasons
that
god
may
foresee
that
an
event
will
happen
it
is
not
necessary
that
it
happen
since
god
foresees
things
not
as
futurities
and
as
in
their
causes
but
as
present
that
begins
and
finishes
one
is
justified
in
admitting
the
necessity
of
the
consequence
but
one
has
no
reason
to
resort
to
the
question
how
the
future
is
present
to
god
for
the
necessity
of
the
consequence
does
not
prevent
the
event
or
consequent
from
being
contingent
in
itself
our
author
thinks
that
since
the
doctrine
revived
by
arminius
had
been
favoured
in
england
by
archbishop
laud
and
by
the
court
and
important
ecclesiastical
promotions
had
been
only
for
those
of
that
party
this
contributed
to
the
revolt
which
caused
the
bishop
and
him
to
meet
in
their
exile
in
paris
at
the
house
of
lord
newcastle
and
to
enter
into
a
discussion
i
would
not
approve
all
the
measures
of
archbishop
laud
who
had
merit
and
perhaps
also
good
will
but
who
appears
to
have
goaded
the
presbyterians
excessively
nevertheless
one
may
say
that
the
revolutions
as
much
in
the
low
countries
as
in
great
britain
in
part
arose
from
the
extreme
intolerance
of
the
strict
party
one
may
say
also
that
the
defenders
of
the
absolute
decree
were
at
least
as
strict
as
the
others
having
oppressed
their
opponents
in
holland
with
the
authority
of
prince
maurice
and
having
fomented
the
revolts
in
england
against
king
charles
i
but
these
are
the
faults
of
men
and
not
of
dogmas
their
opponents
do
not
spare
them
either
witness
the
severity
used
in
saxony
against
nicolas
krell
and
the
proceedings
of
the
jesuits
against
the
bishop
of
party
hobbes
observes
after
aristotle
that
there
are
two
sources
for
proofs
reason
and
authority
as
for
reason
he
says
that
he
admits
the
reasons
derived
from
the
attributes
of
god
which
he
calls
argumentative
and
the
notions
whereof
are
conceivable
but
he
maintains
that
there
are
others
wherein
one
conceives
nothing
and
which
are
only
expressions
by
which
we
aspire
to
honour
god
but
i
do
not
see
how
one
can
honour
god
by
expressions
that
have
no
meaning
it
may
be
that
with
hobbes
as
with
spinoza
wisdom
goodness
justice
are
only
fictions
in
relation
to
god
and
the
universe
since
the
prime
cause
according
to
them
acts
through
the
necessity
of
its
power
and
not
by
the
choice
of
its
wisdom
that
is
an
opinion
whose
falsity
i
have
sufficiently
proved
it
appears
that
hobbes
did
not
wish
to
declare
himself
enough
for
fear
of
causing
offence
to
people
on
which
point
he
is
to
be
commended
it
was
also
on
that
account
as
he
says
himself
that
he
had
desired
that
what
had
passed
between
the
bishop
and
him
in
paris
should
not
be
published
he
adds
that
it
is
not
good
to
say
that
an
action
which
god
does
not
will
happens
since
that
is
to
say
in
effect
that
god
is
lacking
in
power
but
he
adds
also
at
the
same
time
that
it
is
not
good
either
to
say
the
opposite
and
to
attribute
to
god
that
he
wills
the
evil
because
that
is
not
seemly
and
would
appear
to
accuse
god
of
lack
of
goodness
he
believes
therefore
that
in
these
matters
telling
the
truth
is
not
advisable
he
would
be
right
if
the
truth
were
in
the
paradoxical
opinions
that
he
maintains
for
indeed
it
appears
that
according
to
the
opinion
of
this
writer
god
has
no
goodness
or
rather
that
that
which
he
calls
god
is
nothing
but
the
blind
nature
of
the
mass
of
material
things
which
acts
according
to
mathematical
laws
following
an
absolute
necessity
as
the
atoms
do
in
the
system
of
epicurus
if
god
were
as
the
great
are
sometimes
here
on
earth
it
would
not
be
fitting
to
utter
all
the
truths
concerning
him
but
god
is
not
as
a
man
whose
designs
and
actions
often
must
be
concealed
rather
it
is
always
permissible
and
reasonable
to
publish
the
counsels
and
the
actions
of
god
because
they
are
always
glorious
and
worthy
of
praise
thus
it
is
always
right
to
utter
truths
concerning
the
divinity
one
need
not
anyhow
refrain
from
fear
of
giving
offence
and
i
have
explained
so
it
seems
to
me
in
a
way
which
satisfies
reason
and
does
not
wound
piety
how
it
is
to
be
understood
that
god
will
takes
effect
and
concurs
with
sin
without
compromising
his
wisdom
and
his
goodness
as
to
the
authorities
derived
from
holy
scripture
hobbes
divides
them
into
three
kinds
some
he
says
are
for
me
the
second
kind
are
neutral
and
the
third
seem
to
be
for
my
opponent
the
passages
which
he
thinks
favourable
to
his
opinion
are
those
which
ascribe
to
god
the
cause
of
our
will
thus
xlv
where
joseph
says
to
his
brethren
not
grieved
nor
angry
with
yourselves
that
you
sold
me
hither
for
god
did
send
me
before
you
to
preserve
life
and

not

are
diversities
of

worketh

are
his
workmanship
created
in
christ
jesus
unto
good
works
which
god

ordained

phil

is
god
which
worketh
in
you
both

and
to

his
good
pleasure
one
may
add
to
these
passages
all
those
which
make
god
the
author
of
all
grace
and
of
all
good
inclinations
and
all
those
which
say
that
we
are
as
dead
in
sin
here
now
are
the
neutral
passages
according
to
hobbes
these
are
those
where
holy
scripture
says
that
man
has
the
choice
to
act
if
he
wills
or
not
to
act
if
he
wills
not
for
example
deut

and
say
unto

thus

the

choose

one
of
them

i
may
do
it
unto
thee
and
isa
vii
the
child
shall
know
to
refuse
the
evil
and
choose
the
good
finally
the
passages
which
hobbes
acknowledges
to
be
apparently
contrary
to
his
opinion
are
all
those
where
it
is
indicated
that
the
will
of
man
is
not
in
conformity
with
that
of
god
thus
isa
could
have
been
done
more
to
my
vineyard
that
i
have
not
done
in
it
wherefore
when
i
looked
that
it
should
bring
forth
grapes
brought
it
forth
wild
grapes
and
jer
xix
have
built
also
the
high
places
of
baal
to
burn
their
sons
with
fire
for
burnt
offerings
unto
baal
which
i
commanded
not
nor
spake
it
neither
came
it
into
my
mind
and
hos
xiii
israel
thou
hast
destroyed
thyself
but
in
me
is
thine
help
and
i
tim
ii
will
have
all
men
to
be
saved
and
to
come
unto
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
he
avows
that
he
could
quote
very
many
other
passages
such
as
those
which
indicate
that
god
willeth
not
iniquity
that
he
willeth
the
salvation
of
the
sinner
and
generally
all
those
which
declare
that
god
commands
good
and
forbids
evil
hobbes
makes
answer
to
these
passages
that
god
does
not
always
will
that
which
he
commands
as
for
example
when
he
commanded
abraham
to
sacrifice
his
son
and
that
god
revealed
will
is
not
always
his
full
will
or
his
decree
as
when
he
revealed
to
jonah
that
nineveh
would
perish
in
forty
days
he
adds
also
that
when
it
is
said
that
god
wills
the
salvation
of
all
that
means
simply
that
god
commands
that
all
do
that
which
is
necessary
for
salvation
when
moreover
the
scripture
says
that
god
wills
not
sin
that
means
that
he
wills
to
punish
it
and
as
for
the
rest
hobbes
ascribes
it
to
the
forms
of
expression
used
among
men
but
one
will
answer
him
that
it
would
be
to
god
discredit
that
his
revealed
will
should
be
opposed
to
his
real
will
that
what
he
bade
jonah
say
to
the
ninevites
was
rather
a
threat
than
a
prediction
and
that
thus
the
condition
of
impenitence
was
implied
therein
moreover
the
ninevites
took
it
in
this
sense
one
will
say
also
that
it
is
quite
true
that
god
in
commanding
abraham
to
sacrifice
his
son
willed
obedience
but
did
not
will
action
which
he
prevented
after
having
obtained
obedience
for
that
was
not
an
action
deserving
in
itself
to
be
willed
and
it
is
not
the
same
in
the
case
of
actions
where
he
exerts
his
will
positively
and
which
are
in
fact
worthy
to
be
the
object
of
his
will
of
such
are
piety
charity
and
every
virtuous
action
that
god
commands
of
such
is
omission
of
sin
a
thing
more
alien
to
divine
perfection
than
any
other
it
is
therefore
incomparably
better
to
explain
the
will
of
god
as
i
have
explained
it
in
this
work
thus
i
shall
say
that
god
by
virtue
of
his
supreme
goodness
has
in
the
beginning
a
serious
inclination
to
produce
or
to
see
and
cause
to
be
produced
all
good
and
every
laudable
action
and
to
prevent
or
to
see
and
cause
to
fail
all
evil
and
every
bad
action
but
he
is
determined
by
this
same
goodness
united
to
an
infinite
wisdom
and
by
the
very
concourse
of
all
the
previous
and
particular
inclinations
towards
each
good
and
towards
the
preventing
of
each
evil
to
produce
the
best
possible
design
of
things
this
is
his
final
and
decretory
will
and
this
design
of
the
best
being
of
such
a
nature
that
the
good
must
be
enhanced
therein
as
light
is
enhanced
by
shade
by
some
evil
which
is
incomparably
less
than
this
good
god
could
not
have
excluded
this
evil
nor
introduced
certain
goods
that
were
excluded
from
this
plan
without
wronging
his
supreme
perfection
so
for
that
reason
one
must
say
that
he
permitted
the
sins
of
others
because
otherwise
he
would
have
himself
performed
an
action
worse
than
all
the
sin
of
creatures
i
find
that
the
bishop
of
derry
is
at
least
justified
in
saying
article
xv
in
his
reply
that
the
opinion
of
his
opponents
is
contrary
to
piety
when
they
ascribe
all
to
god
power
only
and
that
hobbes
ought
not
to
have
said
that
honour
or
worship
is
only
a
sign
of
the
power
of
him
whom
one
honours
for
one
may
also
and
one
must
acknowledge
and
honour
wisdom
goodness
justice
and
other
perfections
facile
laudamus
bonos
this
opinion
which
despoils
god
of
all
goodness
and
of
all
true
justice
which
represents
him
as
a
tyrant
wielding
an
absolute
power
independent
of
all
right
and
of
all
equity
and
creating
millions
of
creatures
to
be
eternally
unhappy
and
this
without
any
other
aim
than
that
of
displaying
his
power
this
opinion
i
say
is
capable
of
rendering
men
very
evil
and
if
it
were
accepted
no
other
devil
would
be
needed
in
the
world
to
set
men
at
variance
among
themselves
and
with
god
as
the
serpent
did
in
making
eve
believe
that
god
when
he
forbade
her
the
fruit
of
the
tree
did
not
will
her
good
hobbes
endeavours
to
parry
this
thrust
in
his
rejoinder
by
saying
that
goodness
is
a
part
of
the
power
of
god
that
is
to
say
the
power
of
making
himself
worthy
of
love
but
that
is
an
abuse
of
terms
by
an
evasion
and
confounds
things
that
must
be
kept
distinct
after
all
if
god
does
not
intend
the
good
of
intelligent
creatures
if
he
has
no
other
principles
of
justice
than
his
power
alone
which
makes
him
produce
either
arbitrarily
that
which
chance
presents
to
him
or
by
necessity
all
that
which
is
possible
without
the
intervention
of
choice
founded
on
good
how
can
he
make
himself
worthy
of
love
it
is
therefore
the
doctrine
either
of
blind
power
or
of
arbitrary
power
which
destroys
piety
for
the
one
destroys
the
intelligent
principle
or
the
providence
of
god
the
other
attributes
to
him
actions
which
are
appropriate
to
the
evil
principle
justice
in
god
says
hobbes
is
nothing
but
the
power
he
has
which
he
exercises
in
distributing
blessings
and
afflictions
this
definition
surprises
me
it
is
not
the
power
to
distribute
them
but
the
will
to
distribute
them
reasonably
that
is
goodness
guided
by
wisdom
which
makes
the
justice
of
god
but
says
he
justice
is
not
in
god
as
in
a
man
who
is
only
just
through
the
observance
of
laws
made
by
his
superior
hobbes
is
mistaken
also
in
that
as
well
as
herr
pufendorf
who
followed
him
justice
does
not
depend
upon
arbitrary
laws
of
superiors
but
on
the
eternal
rules
of
wisdom
and
of
goodness
in
men
as
well
as
in
god
hobbes
asserts
in
the
same
passage
that
the
wisdom
which
is
attributed
to
god
does
not
lie
in
a
logical
consideration
of
the
relation
of
means
to
ends
but
in
an
incomprehensible
attribute
attributed
to
an
incomprehensible
nature
to
honour
it
it
seems
as
if
he
means
that
it
is
an
indescribable
something
attributed
to
an
indescribable
something
and
even
a
chimerical
quality
given
to
a
chimerical
substance
to
intimidate
and
to
deceive
the
nations
through
the
worship
which
they
render
to
it
after
all
it
is
difficult
for
hobbes
to
have
a
different
opinion
of
god
and
of
wisdom
since
he
admits
only
material
substances
if
hobbes
were
still
alive
i
would
beware
of
ascribing
to
him
opinions
which
might
do
him
injury
but
it
is
difficult
to
exempt
him
from
this
he
may
have
changed
his
mind
subsequently
for
he
attained
to
a
great
age
thus
i
hope
that
his
errors
may
not
have
been
deleterious
to
him
but
as
they
might
be
so
to
others
it
is
expedient
to
give
warnings
to
those
who
shall
read
the
writings
of
one
who
otherwise
is
of
great
merit
and
from
whom
one
may
profit
in
many
ways
it
is
true
that
god
does
not
reason
properly
speaking
using
time
as
we
do
to
pass
from
one
truth
to
the
other
but
as
he
understands
at
one
and
the
same
time
all
the
truths
and
all
their
connexions
he
knows
all
the
conclusions
and
he
contains
in
the
highest
degree
within
himself
all
the
reasonings
that
we
can
develop
and
just
because
of
that
his
wisdom
is
perfect
observations
on
the
book
concerning
origin
of
evil
published
recently
in
london
it
is
a
pity
that
bayle
should
have
seen
only
the
reviews
of
this
admirable
work
which
are
to
be
found
in
the
journals
if
he
had
read
it
himself
and
examined
it
properly
he
would
have
provided
us
with
a
good
opportunity
of
throwing
light
on
many
difficulties
which
spring
again
and
again
like
the
head
of
the
hydra
in
a
matter
where
it
is
easy
to
become
confused
when
one
has
not
seen
the
whole
system
or
does
not
take
the
trouble
to
reason
according
to
a
strict
plan
for
strictness
of
reasoning
performs
in
subjects
that
transcend
imagination
the
same
function
as
figures
do
in
geometry
there
must
always
be
something
capable
of
fixing
our
attention
and
forming
a
connexion
between
our
thoughts
that
is
why
when
this
latin
book
so
learned
and
so
elegant
of
style
printed
originally
in
london
and
then
reprinted
in
bremen
fell
into
my
hands
i
judged
that
the
seriousness
of
the
matter
and
the
author
merit
required
an
attention
which
readers
might
fairly
expect
of
me
since
we
are
agreed
only
in
regard
to
half
of
the
subject
indeed
as
the
work
contains
five
chapters
and
the
fifth
with
the
appendix
equals
the
rest
in
size
i
have
observed
that
the
first
four
where
it
is
a
question
of
evil
in
general
and
of
physical
evil
in
particular
are
in
harmony
with
my
principles
save
for
a
few
individual
passages
and
that
they
sometimes
even
develop
with
force
and
eloquence
some
points
i
had
treated
but
slightly
because
bayle
had
not
placed
emphasis
upon
them
but
the
fifth
chapter
with
its
sections
of
which
some
are
equal
to
entire
chapters
speaking
of
freedom
and
of
the
moral
evil
dependent
upon
it
is
constructed
upon
principles
opposed
to
mine
and
often
indeed
to
those
of
bayle
that
is
if
it
were
possible
to
credit
him
with
any
fixed
principles
for
this
fifth
chapter
tends
to
show
if
that
were
possible
that
true
freedom
depends
upon
an
indifference
of
equipoise
vague
complete
and
absolute
so
that
until
the
will
has
determined
itself
there
would
be
no
reason
for
its
determination
either
in
him
who
chooses
or
in
the
object
and
one
would
not
choose
what
pleases
but
in
choosing
without
reason
one
would
cause
what
one
chooses
to
be
pleasing
this
principle
of
choice
without
cause
or
reason
of
a
choice
i
say
divested
of
the
aim
of
wisdom
and
goodness
is
regarded
by
many
as
the
great
privilege
of
god
and
of
intelligent
substances
and
as
the
source
of
their
freedom
their
satisfaction
their
morality
and
their
good
or
evil
the
fantasy
of
a
power
to
declare
one
independence
not
only
of
inclination
but
of
reason
itself
within
and
of
good
and
evil
without
is
sometimes
painted
in
such
fine
colours
that
one
might
take
it
to
be
the
most
excellent
thing
in
the
world
nevertheless
it
is
only
a
hollow
fantasy
a
suppression
of
the
reasons
for
the
caprice
of
which
one
boasts
what
is
asserted
is
impossible
but
if
it
came
to
pass
it
would
be
harmful
this
fantastic
character
might
be
attributed
to
some
don
juan
in
a
peter
feast
and
a
man
of
romantic
disposition
might
even
affect
the
outward
appearances
of
it
and
persuade
himself
that
he
has
it
in
reality
but
in
nature
there
will
never
be
any
choice
to
which
one
is
not
prompted
by
the
previous
representation
of
good
or
evil
by
inclinations
or
by
reasons
and
i
have
always
challenged
the
supporters
of
this
absolute
indifference
to
show
an
example
thereof
nevertheless
if
i
call
fantastic
this
choice
whereto
one
is
determined
by
nothing
i
am
far
from
calling
visionaries
the
supporters
of
that
hypothesis
especially
our
gifted
author
the
peripatetics
teach
some
beliefs
of
this
nature
but
it
would
be
the
greatest
injustice
in
the
world
to
be
ready
to
despise
on
that
account
an
occam
a
suisset
a
cesalpino
a
conringius
men
who
still
advocated
certain
scholastic
opinions
which
have
been
improved
upon
one
of
these
opinions
revived
however
and
introduced
by
degenerate
scholasticism
and
in
the
age
of
chimeras
is
vague
indifference
of
choice
or
real
chance
assumed
in
our
souls
as
if
nothing
gave
us
any
inclination
unless
we
perceived
it
distinctly
and
as
if
an
effect
could
be
without
causes
when
these
causes
are
imperceptible
it
is
much
as
some
have
denied
the
existence
of
insensible
corpuscles
because
they
do
not
see
them
modern
philosophers
have
improved
upon
the
opinions
of
the
schoolmen
by
showing
that
according
to
the
laws
of
corporeal
nature
a
body
can
only
be
set
in
motion
by
the
movement
of
another
body
propelling
it
even
so
we
must
believe
that
our
souls
by
virtue
of
the
laws
of
spiritual
nature
can
only
be
moved
by
some
reason
of
good
or
evil
and
this
even
when
no
distinct
knowledge
can
be
extracted
from
our
mental
state
on
account
of
a
concourse
of
innumerable
little
perceptions
which
make
us
now
joyful
and
now
sad
or
again
of
some
other
humour
and
cause
us
to
like
one
thing
more
than
another
without
its
being
possible
to
say
why
plato
aristotle
and
even
thomas
aquinas
durand
and
other
schoolmen
of
the
sounder
sort
reason
on
that
question
like
the
generality
of
men
and
as
unprejudiced
people
always
have
reasoned
they
assume
that
freedom
lies
in
the
use
of
reason
and
the
inclinations
which
cause
the
choice
or
rejection
of
objects
but
finally
some
rather
too
subtle
philosophers
have
extracted
from
their
alembic
an
inexplicable
notion
of
choice
independent
of
anything
whatsoever
which
is
said
to
do
wonders
in
solving
all
difficulties
but
the
notion
is
caught
up
at
the
outset
in
one
of
the
greatest
difficulties
by
offending
against
the
grand
principle
of
reasoning
which
makes
us
always
assume
that
nothing
is
done
without
some
sufficient
cause
or
reason
as
the
schoolmen
often
forgot
to
apply
this
great
principle
admitting
certain
prime
occult
qualities
one
need
not
wonder
if
this
fiction
of
vague
indifference
met
with
applause
amongst
them
and
if
even
most
worthy
men
have
been
imbued
therewith
our
author
who
is
otherwise
rid
of
many
of
the
errors
of
the
ordinary
schoolmen
is
still
deluded
by
this
fiction
but
he
is
without
doubt
one
of
the
most
skilful
of
those
who
have
supported
it
pergama
possent
etiam
hac
defensa
he
gives
it
the
best
possible
turn
and
only
shows
it
on
its
good
side
he
knows
how
to
strip
spontaneity
and
reason
of
their
advantages
transferring
all
these
to
vague
indifference
only
through
this
indifference
is
one
active
resisting
the
passions
taking
pleasure
in
one
choice
or
being
happy
it
appears
indeed
that
one
would
be
miserable
if
some
happy
necessity
should
oblige
us
to
choose
aright
our
author
had
said
admirable
things
on
the
origin
and
reasons
of
natural
evils
he
only
had
to
apply
the
same
principles
to
moral
evil
indeed
he
believes
himself
that
moral
evil
becomes
an
evil
through
the
physical
evils
that
it
causes
or
tends
to
cause
but
somehow
or
other
he
thinks
that
it
would
be
a
degradation
of
god
and
men
if
they
were
to
be
made
subject
to
reason
that
thus
they
would
all
be
rendered
passive
to
it
and
would
no
longer
be
satisfied
with
themselves
in
short
that
men
would
have
nothing
wherewith
to
oppose
the
misfortunes
that
come
to
them
from
without
if
they
had
not
within
them
this
admirable
privilege
of
rendering
things
good
or
tolerable
by
choosing
them
and
of
changing
all
into
gold
by
the
touch
of
this
wondrous
faculty
we
will
examine
it
in
closer
detail
presently
but
it
will
be
well
to
profit
beforehand
by
the
excellent
ideas
of
our
author
on
the
nature
of
things
and
on
natural
evils
particularly
since
there
are
some
points
in
which
we
shall
be
able
to
go
a
little
further
by
this
means
also
we
shall
gain
a
better
understanding
of
the
whole
arrangement
of
his
system
the
first
chapter
contains
the
principles
the
writer
calls
substance
a
being
the
idea
of
which
does
not
involve
the
existence
of
another
i
do
not
know
if
there
are
any
such
among
created
beings
by
reason
of
the
connexion
existing
between
all
things
and
the
example
of
a
wax
torch
is
not
the
example
of
a
substance
any
more
than
that
of
a
swarm
of
bees
would
be
but
one
may
take
the
terms
in
an
extended
sense
he
observes
aptly
that
after
all
the
changes
of
matter
and
after
all
the
qualities
of
which
it
may
be
divested
there
remain
extension
mobility
divisibility
and
resistance
he
explains
also
the
nature
of
notions
and
leaves
it
to
be
understood
that
indicate
only
the
resemblances
which
exist
between
that
we
understand
by
only
that
which
is
known
through
an
immediate
sensation
and
that
the
rest
is
known
to
us
only
through
relations
with
these
ideas
but
when
he
admits
that
we
have
no
idea
of
god
of
spirit
of
substance
he
does
not
appear
to
have
observed
sufficiently
that
we
have
immediate
apperception
of
substance
and
of
spirit
in
our
apperception
of
ourselves
and
that
the
idea
of
god
is
found
in
the
idea
of
ourselves
through
a
suppression
of
the
limits
of
our
perfections
as
extension
taken
in
an
absolute
sense
is
comprised
in
the
idea
of
a
globe
he
is
right
also
in
asserting
that
our
simple
ideas
at
least
are
innate
and
in
rejecting
the
of
aristotle
and
of
locke
but
i
can
not
agree
with
him
that
our
ideas
have
scarce
any
more
relation
to
things
than
words
uttered
into
the
air
or
writings
traced
upon
paper
have
to
our
ideas
and
that
the
bearing
of
our
sensations
is
arbitrary
and
like
the
signification
of
words
i
have
already
indicated
elsewhere
why
i
am
not
in
agreement
with
our
cartesians
on
that
point
for
the
purpose
of
advancing
to
the
first
cause
the
author
seeks
a
criterion
a
distinguishing
mark
of
truth
and
he
finds
it
in
the
force
whereby
our
inward
assertions
when
they
are
evident
compel
the
understanding
to
give
them
its
consent
it
is
by
such
a
process
he
says
that
we
credit
the
senses
he
points
out
that
the
distinguishing
mark
in
the
cartesian
scheme
to
wit
a
clear
and
distinct
perception
has
need
of
a
new
mark
to
indicate
what
is
clear
and
distinct
and
that
the
congruity
or
of
ideas
or
rather
of
terms
as
one
spoke
formerly
may
still
be
deceptive
because
there
are
congruities
real
and
apparent
he
appears
to
recognize
even
that
the
inward
force
which
constrains
us
to
give
our
assent
is
still
a
matter
for
caution
and
may
come
from
prejudices
that
is
why
he
confesses
that
he
who
should
furnish
another
criterion
would
have
found
something
very
advantageous
to
the
human
race
i
have
endeavoured
to
explain
this
criterion
in
a
little
on
truth
and
published
in
and
although
i
do
not
boast
of
having
given
therein
a
new
discovery
i
hope
that
i
have
expounded
things
which
were
only
confusedly
recognized
i
distinguish
between
truths
of
fact
and
truths
of
reason
truths
of
fact
can
only
be
verified
by
confronting
them
with
truths
of
reason
and
by
tracing
them
back
to
immediate
perceptions
within
us
such
as
augustine
and
descartes
very
promptly
acknowledged
to
be
indubitable
that
is
to
say
we
can
not
doubt
that
we
think
nor
indeed
that
we
think
this
thing
or
that
but
in
order
to
judge
whether
our
inward
notions
have
any
reality
in
things
and
to
pass
from
thoughts
to
objects
my
opinion
is
that
it
is
necessary
to
consider
whether
our
perceptions
are
firmly
connected
among
themselves
and
with
others
that
we
have
had
in
such
fashion
as
to
manifest
the
rules
of
mathematics
and
other
truths
of
reason
in
this
case
one
must
regard
them
as
real
and
i
think
that
it
is
the
only
means
of
distinguishing
them
from
imaginations
dreams
and
visions
thus
the
truth
of
things
outside
us
can
be
recognized
only
through
the
connexion
of
phenomena
the
criterion
of
the
truths
of
reason
or
those
which
spring
from
conceptions
is
found
in
an
exact
use
of
the
rules
of
logic
as
for
ideas
or
notions
i
call
all
those
the
possibility
of
which
is
certain
and
the
which
do
not
mark
this
possibility
are
only
geometricians
well
versed
in
analysis
are
aware
what
difference
there
is
in
this
respect
between
several
properties
by
which
some
line
or
figure
might
be
defined
our
gifted
author
has
not
gone
so
far
perhaps
one
may
see
however
from
the
account
i
have
given
of
him
already
and
from
what
follows
that
he
is
by
no
means
lacking
in
profundity
or
reflexion
thereafter
he
proceeds
to
examine
whether
motion
matter
and
space
spring
from
themselves
and
to
that
end
he
considers
whether
it
is
possible
to
conceive
that
they
do
not
exist
he
remarks
upon
this
privilege
of
god
that
as
soon
as
it
is
assumed
that
he
exists
it
must
be
admitted
that
he
exists
of
necessity
this
is
a
corollary
to
a
remark
which
i
made
in
the
little
discourse
mentioned
above
namely
that
as
soon
as
one
admits
that
god
is
possible
one
must
admit
that
he
exists
of
necessity
now
as
soon
as
one
admits
that
god
exists
one
admits
that
he
is
possible
therefore
as
soon
as
one
admits
that
god
exists
one
must
admit
that
he
exists
of
necessity
now
this
privilege
does
not
belong
to
the
three
things
of
which
we
have
just
spoken
the
author
believes
also
especially
concerning
motion
that
it
is
not
sufficient
to
say
with
hobbes
that
the
present
movement
comes
from
an
anterior
movement
and
this
one
again
from
another
and
so
on
to
infinity
for
however
far
back
you
may
go
you
will
not
be
one
whit
nearer
to
finding
the
reason
which
causes
the
presence
of
motion
in
matter
therefore
this
reason
must
be
outside
the
sequence
and
even
if
there
were
an
eternal
motion
it
would
require
an
eternal
motive
power
so
the
rays
of
the
sun
even
though
they
were
eternal
with
the
sun
would
nevertheless
have
their
eternal
cause
in
the
sun
i
am
well
pleased
to
recount
these
arguments
of
our
gifted
author
that
it
may
be
seen
how
important
according
to
him
is
the
principle
of
sufficient
reason
for
if
it
is
permitted
to
admit
something
for
which
it
is
acknowledged
there
is
no
reason
it
will
be
easy
for
an
atheist
to
overthrow
this
argument
by
saying
that
it
is
not
necessary
that
there
be
a
sufficient
reason
for
the
existence
of
motion
i
will
not
enter
into
the
discussion
of
the
reality
and
the
eternity
of
space
for
fear
of
straying
too
far
from
our
subject
it
is
enough
to
state
that
the
author
believes
that
space
can
be
annihilated
by
the
divine
power
but
in
entirety
and
not
in
portions
and
that
we
could
exist
alone
with
god
even
if
there
were
neither
space
nor
matter
since
we
do
not
contain
within
ourselves
the
notion
of
the
existence
of
external
things
he
also
puts
forward
the
consideration
that
in
the
sensations
of
sounds
of
odours
and
of
savours
the
idea
of
space
is
not
included
but
whatever
the
opinion
formed
as
to
space
it
suffices
that
there
is
a
god
the
cause
of
matter
and
of
motion
and
in
short
of
all
things
the
author
believes
that
we
can
reason
about
god
as
one
born
blind
would
reason
about
light
but
i
hold
that
there
is
something
more
in
us
for
our
light
is
a
ray
from
god
light
after
having
spoken
of
some
attributes
of
god
the
author
acknowledges
that
god
acts
for
an
end
which
is
the
communication
of
his
goodness
and
that
his
works
are
ordered
aright
finally
he
concludes
this
chapter
very
properly
by
saying
that
god
in
creating
the
world
was
at
pains
to
give
it
the
greatest
harmony
amongst
things
the
greatest
comfort
of
beings
endowed
with
reason
and
the
greatest
compatibility
in
desires
that
an
infinite
power
wisdom
and
goodness
combined
could
produce
he
adds
that
if
some
evil
has
remained
notwithstanding
one
must
believe
that
these
infinite
divine
perfections
could
not
have
i
would
rather
say
ought
not
to
have
taken
it
away

divinitus
esse
creatam
because
there
are
so
many
faults
in
the
nature
of
things
tanta
stat
praedita
others
have
admitted
two
principles
the
one
good
the
other
evil
there
have
also
been
people
who
thought
the
difficulty
insurmountable
and
among
these
our
author
appears
to
have
had
bayle
in
mind
he
hopes
to
show
in
his
work
that
it
is
not
a
gordian
knot
which
needs
to
be
cut
and
he
says
rightly
that
the
power
the
wisdom
and
the
goodness
of
god
would
not
be
infinite
and
perfect
in
their
exercise
if
these
evils
had
been
banished
he
begins
with
the
evil
of
imperfection
in
chapter
iii
and
observes
as
augustine
does
that
creatures
are
imperfect
since
they
are
derived
from
nothingness
whereas
god
producing
a
perfect
substance
from
his
own
essence
would
have
made
thereof
a
god
this
gives
him
occasion
for
making
a
little
digression
against
the
socinians
but
someone
will
say
why
did
not
god
refrain
from
producing
things
rather
than
make
imperfect
things
the
author
answers
appositely
that
the
abundance
of
the
goodness
of
god
is
the
cause
he
wished
to
communicate
himself
at
the
expense
of
a
certain
fastidiousness
which
we
assume
in
god
imagining
that
imperfections
offend
him
thus
he
preferred
that
there
should
be
the
imperfect
rather
than
nothing
but
one
might
have
added
that
god
has
produced
indeed
the
most
perfect
whole
that
was
possible
one
wherewith
he
had
full
cause
for
satisfaction
the
imperfections
of
the
parts
serving
a
greater
perfection
in
the
whole
also
the
observation
is
made
soon
afterwards
that
certain
things
might
have
been
made
better
but
not
without
other
new
and
greater
disadvantages
this
could
have
been
omitted
for
the
author
also
states
as
a
certainty
and
rightly
so
at
the
end
of
the
chapter
it
appertains
to
infinite
goodness
to
choose
the
and
thus
he
was
able
to
draw
this
conclusion
a
little
earlier
that
imperfect
things
will
be
added
to
those
more
perfect
so
long
as
they
do
not
preclude
the
existence
of
the
more
perfect
in
as
great
a
number
as
possible
thus
bodies
were
created
as
well
as
spirits
since
the
one
does
not
offer
any
obstacle
to
the
other
and
the
creation
of
matter
was
not
unworthy
of
the
great
god
as
some
heretics
of
old
believed
attributing
this
work
to
a
certain
demogorgon
let
us
now
proceed
to
physical
evil
which
is
treated
of
in
chapter
iv
our
famous
author
having
observed
that
metaphysical
evil
or
imperfection
springs
from
nothingness
concludes
that
physical
evil
or
discomfort
springs
from
matter
or
rather
from
its
movement
for
without
movement
matter
would
be
useless
moreover
there
must
be
contrariety
in
these
movements
otherwise
if
all
went
together
in
the
same
direction
there
would
be
neither
variety
nor
generation
but
the
movements
that
cause
generations
cause
also
corruptions
since
from
the
variety
of
movements
comes
concussion
between
bodies
by
which
they
are
often
dissipated
and
destroyed
the
author
of
nature
however
in
order
to
render
bodies
more
enduring
distributed
them
into
those
which
we
know
being
composed
of
luminous
and
opaque
balls
in
a
manner
so
excellent
and
so
fitting
for
the
display
of
that
which
they
contain
and
for
arousing
wonder
thereat
that
we
can
conceive
of
nothing
more
beautiful
but
the
crowning
point
of
the
work
was
the
construction
of
animals
to
the
end
that
everywhere
there
should
be
creatures
capable
of
cognition
regio
foret
ulla
suis
animalibus
our
sagacious
author
believes
that
the
air
and
even
the
purest
aether
have
their
denizens
as
well
as
the
water
and
the
earth
but
supposing
that
there
were
places
without
animals
these
places
might
have
uses
necessary
for
other
places
which
are
inhabited
so
for
example
the
mountains
which
render
the
surface
of
our
globe
unequal
and
sometimes
desert
and
barren
are
of
use
for
the
production
of
rivers
and
of
winds
and
we
have
no
cause
to
complain
of
sands
and
marshes
since
there
are
so
many
places
still
remaining
to
be
cultivated
moreover
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
all
is
made
for
man
alone
and
the
author
is
persuaded
that
there
are
not
only
pure
spirits
but
also
immortal
animals
of
a
nature
akin
to
these
spirits
that
is
animals
whose
souls
are
united
to
an
ethereal
and
incorruptible
matter
but
it
is
not
the
same
with
animals
whose
body
is
terrestrial
composed
of
tubes
and
fluids
which
circulate
therein
and
whose
motion
is
terminated
by
the
breaking
of
the
vessels
thence
the
author
is
led
to
believe
that
the
immortality
granted
to
adam
if
he
had
been
obedient
would
not
have
been
an
effect
of
his
nature
but
of
the
grace
of
god
now
it
was
necessary
for
the
conservation
of
corruptible
animals
that
they
should
have
indications
causing
them
to
recognize
a
present
danger
and
giving
them
the
inclination
to
avoid
it
that
is
why
what
is
about
to
cause
a
great
injury
must
beforehand
cause
pain
such
as
may
force
the
animal
to
efforts
capable
of
repulsing
or
shunning
the
cause
of
this
discomfort
and
of
forestalling
a
greater
evil
the
dread
of
death
helps
also
to
cause
its
avoidance
for
it
if
were
not
so
ugly
and
if
the
dissolution
of
continuity
were
not
so
painful
very
often
animals
would
take
no
precautions
against
perishing
or
allowing
the
parts
of
their
body
to
perish
and
the
strongest
would
have
difficulty
in
subsisting
for
a
whole
day
god
has
also
given
hunger
and
thirst
to
animals
to
compel
them
to
feed
and
maintain
themselves
by
replacing
that
which
is
used
up
and
which
disappears
imperceptibly
these
appetites
are
of
use
also
to
prompt
them
to
work
in
order
to
procure
a
nourishment
meet
for
their
constitution
and
which
may
avail
to
invigorate
them
it
was
even
found
necessary
by
the
author
of
things
that
one
animal
very
often
should
serve
as
food
for
another
this
hardly
renders
the
victim
more
unhappy
since
death
caused
by
diseases
is
generally
just
as
painful
as
a
violent
death
if
not
more
so
and
animals
subject
to
being
preyed
upon
by
others
having
neither
foresight
nor
anxiety
for
the
future
have
a
life
no
less
tranquil
when
they
are
not
in
danger
it
is
the
same
with
inundations
earthquakes
thunderbolts
and
other
disorders
which
brute
beasts
do
not
fear
and
which
men
have
ordinarily
no
cause
to
fear
since
there
are
few
that
suffer
thereby
the
author
of
nature
has
compensated
for
these
evils
and
others
which
happen
only
seldom
with
a
thousand
advantages
that
are
ordinary
and
constant
hunger
and
thirst
augment
the
pleasure
experienced
in
the
taking
of
nourishment
moderate
work
is
an
agreeable
exercise
of
the
powers
and
sleep
is
also
agreeable
in
an
altogether
opposite
way
restoring
the
forces
through
repose
but
one
of
the
pleasures
most
intense
is
that
which
prompts
animals
to
propagation
god
having
taken
care
to
ensure
that
the
species
should
be
immortal
since
the
individual
can
not
be
so
here
on
earth
also
willed
that
animals
should
have
a
great
tenderness
for
their
little
ones
even
to
the
point
of
endangering
themselves
for
their
preservation
from
pain
and
from
sensual
pleasure
spring
fear
cupidity
and
the
other
passions
that
are
ordinarily
serviceable
although
it
may
accidentally
happen
that
they
sometimes
turn
towards
ill
one
must
say
as
much
of
poisons
epidemic
diseases
and
other
hurtful
things
namely
that
these
are
indispensable
consequences
of
a
system
as
for
ignorance
and
errors
it
must
be
taken
into
account
that
the
most
perfect
creatures
are
doubtless
ignorant
of
much
and
that
knowledge
is
wont
to
be
proportionate
to
needs
nevertheless
it
is
necessary
that
one
be
exposed
to
hazards
which
can
not
be
foreseen
and
accidents
of
such
kinds
are
inevitable
one
must
often
be
mistaken
in
one
judgement
because
it
is
not
always
permitted
to
suspend
it
long
enough
for
exact
consideration
these
disadvantages
are
inseparable
from
the
system
of
things
for
things
must
very
often
resemble
one
another
in
a
certain
situation
the
one
being
taken
for
the
other
but
the
inevitable
errors
are
not
the
most
usual
nor
the
most
pernicious
those
which
cause
us
the
most
harm
are
wont
to
arise
through
our
fault
and
consequently
one
would
be
wrong
to
make
natural
evils
a
pretext
for
taking
one
own
life
since
one
finds
that
those
who
have
done
so
have
generally
been
prompted
to
such
action
by
voluntary
evils
after
all
one
finds
that
all
these
evils
of
which
we
have
spoken
come
accidentally
from
good
causes
and
there
is
reason
to
infer
concerning
all
we
do
not
know
from
all
we
do
know
that
one
could
not
have
done
away
with
them
without
falling
into
greater
troubles
for
the
better
understanding
of
this
the
author
counsels
us
to
picture
the
world
as
a
great
building
there
must
be
not
only
apartments
halls
galleries
gardens
grottoes
but
also
the
kitchen
the
cellar
the
stables
drainage
thus
it
would
not
have
been
proper
to
make
only
suns
in
the
world
or
to
make
an
earth
all
of
gold
and
of
diamonds
but
not
habitable
if
man
had
been
all
eye
or
all
ear
he
would
not
have
been
fitted
for
feeding
himself
if
god
had
made
him
without
passions
he
would
have
made
him
stupid
and
if
he
had
wished
to
make
man
free
from
error
he
would
have
had
to
deprive
him
of
senses
or
give
him
powers
of
sensation
through
some
other
means
than
organs
that
is
to
say
there
would
not
have
been
any
man
our
learned
author
remarks
here
upon
an
idea
which
histories
both
sacred
and
profane
appear
to
inculcate
namely
that
wild
beasts
poisonous
plants
and
other
natures
that
are
injurious
to
us
have
been
armed
against
us
by
sin
but
as
he
argues
here
only
in
accordance
with
the
principles
of
reason
he
sets
aside
what
revelation
can
teach
he
believes
however
that
adam
would
have
been
exempted
from
natural
evils
if
he
had
been
obedient
only
by
virtue
of
divine
grace
and
of
a
covenant
made
with
god
and
that
moses
expressly
indicates
only
about
seven
effects
of
the
first
sin
these
effects
are
the
revocation
of
the
gracious
gift
of
immortality
the
sterility
of
the
earth
which
was
no
longer
to
be
fertile
of
itself
save
in
evil
or
useless
herbs
the
rude
toil
one
must
exercise
in
order
to
gain
sustenance
the
subjection
of
the
woman
to
the
will
of
the
husband
the
pains
of
childbirth
the
enmity
between
man
and
the
serpent
the
banishment
of
man
from
the
place
of
delight
wherein
god
had
placed
him
but
our
author
thinks
that
many
of
our
evils
spring
from
the
necessity
of
matter
especially
since
the
withdrawal
of
grace
moreover
it
seems
to
him
that
after
our
banishment
immortality
would
be
only
a
burden
to
us
and
that
it
is
perhaps
more
for
our
good
than
to
punish
us
that
the
tree
of
life
has
become
inaccessible
to
us
on
one
point
or
another
one
might
have
something
to
say
in
objection
but
the
body
of
the
discourse
by
our
author
on
the
origin
of
evils
is
full
of
good
and
sound
reflexions
which
i
have
judged
it
advisable
to
turn
to
advantage
now
i
must
pass
on
to
the
subject
of
our
controversy
that
is
the
explanation
of
the
nature
of
freedom
the
learned
author
of
this
work
on
the
origin
of
evil
proposing
to
explain
the
origin
of
moral
evil
in
the
fifth
chapter
which
makes
up
half
of
the
whole
book
considers
that
it
is
altogether
different
from
that
of
physical
evil
which
lies
in
the
inevitable
imperfection
of
creatures
for
as
we
shall
see
presently
it
appears
to
him
that
moral
evil
comes
rather
from
that
which
he
calls
a
perfection
which
the
creature
has
in
common
according
to
him
with
the
creator
that
is
to
say
in
the
power
of
choosing
without
any
motive
and
without
any
final
or
impelling
cause
it
is
a
very
great
paradox
to
assert
that
the
greatest
imperfection
namely
sin
springs
from
perfection
itself
but
it
is
no
less
a
paradox
to
present
as
a
perfection
the
thing
which
is
the
least
reasonable
in
the
world
the
advantage
whereof
would
consist
in
being
privileged
against
reason
and
that
after
all
rather
than
pointing
out
the
source
of
the
evil
would
be
to
contend
that
it
has
none
for
if
the
will
makes
its
resolve
without
the
existence
of
anything
either
in
the
person
who
chooses
or
in
the
object
which
is
chosen
to
prompt
it
to
the
choice
there
will
be
neither
cause
nor
reason
for
this
election
and
as
moral
evil
consists
in
the
wrong
choice
that
is
admitting
that
moral
evil
has
no
source
at
all
thus
in
the
rules
of
good
metaphysics
there
would
have
to
be
no
moral
evil
in
nature
and
also
for
the
same
reason
there
would
be
no
moral
good
either
and
all
morality
would
be
destroyed
but
we
must
listen
to
our
gifted
author
from
whom
the
subtlety
of
an
opinion
maintained
by
famous
philosophers
among
the
schoolmen
and
the
adornments
that
he
has
added
thereto
himself
by
his
wit
and
his
eloquence
have
hidden
the
great
disadvantages
contained
therein
in
setting
forth
the
position
reached
in
the
controversy
he
divides
the
writers
into
two
parties
the
one
sort
he
says
are
content
to
say
that
the
freedom
of
the
will
is
exempt
from
outward
constraint
and
the
other
sort
maintain
that
it
is
also
exempt
from
inward
necessity
but
this
exposition
does
not
suffice
unless
one
distinguish
the
necessity
that
is
absolute
and
contrary
to
morality
from
hypothetical
necessity
and
moral
necessity
as
i
have
already
explained
in
many
places
the
first
section
of
this
chapter
is
to
indicate
the
nature
of
choice
the
author
sets
forth
in
the
first
place
the
opinion
of
those
who
believe
that
the
will
is
prompted
by
the
judgement
of
the
understanding
or
by
anterior
inclinations
of
the
desires
to
resolve
upon
the
course
that
it
adopts
but
he
confuses
these
authors
with
those
who
assert
that
the
will
is
prompted
to
its
resolution
by
an
absolute
necessity
and
who
maintain
that
the
person
who
wills
has
no
power
over
his
volitions
that
is
he
confuses
a
thomist
with
a
spinozist
he
makes
use
of
the
admissions
and
the
odious
declarations
of
hobbes
and
his
like
to
lay
them
to
the
charge
of
those
who
are
infinitely
far
removed
from
them
and
who
take
great
care
to
refute
them
he
lays
these
things
to
their
charge
because
they
believe
as
hobbes
believes
like
everyone
else
save
for
some
doctors
who
are
enveloped
in
their
own
subtleties
that
the
will
is
moved
by
the
representation
of
good
and
evil
thence
he
imputes
to
them
the
opinion
that
there
is
therefore
no
such
thing
as
contingency
and
that
all
is
connected
by
an
absolute
necessity
that
is
a
very
speedy
manner
of
reasoning
yet
he
adds
also
that
properly
speaking
there
will
be
no
evil
will
since
if
there
were
all
one
could
object
to
therein
would
be
the
evil
which
it
can
cause
that
he
says
is
different
from
the
common
notion
since
the
world
censures
the
wicked
not
because
they
do
harm
but
because
they
do
harm
without
necessity
he
holds
also
that
the
wicked
would
be
only
unfortunate
and
by
no
means
culpable
that
there
would
be
no
difference
between
physical
evil
and
moral
evil
since
man
himself
would
not
be
the
true
cause
of
an
action
which
he
could
not
avoid
that
would
not
be
either
blamed
or
maltreated
because
they
deserve
it
but
because
that
action
may
serve
to
turn
people
away
from
evil
again
for
this
reason
only
one
would
find
fault
with
a
rogue
but
not
with
a
sick
man
that
reproaches
and
threats
can
correct
the
one
and
can
not
cure
the
other
and
further
according
to
this
doctrine
chastisements
would
have
no
object
save
the
prevention
of
future
evil
without
which
the
mere
consideration
of
the
evil
already
done
would
not
be
sufficient
for
punishment
likewise
gratitude
would
have
as
its
sole
aim
that
of
procuring
a
fresh
benefit
without
which
the
mere
consideration
of
the
past
benefit
would
not
furnish
a
sufficient
reason
finally
the
author
thinks
that
if
this
doctrine
which
derives
the
resolution
of
the
will
from
the
representation
of
good
and
evil
were
true
one
must
despair
of
human
felicity
since
it
would
not
be
in
our
power
and
would
depend
upon
things
which
are
outside
us
now
as
there
is
no
ground
for
hoping
that
things
from
outside
will
order
themselves
and
agree
together
in
accordance
with
our
wishes
there
will
always
lack
something
to
us
and
there
will
always
be
something
too
much
all
these
conclusions
hold
according
to
him
against
those
also
who
think
that
the
will
makes
its
resolve
in
accordance
with
the
final
judgement
of
the
understanding
an
opinion
which
as
he
considers
strips
the
will
of
its
right
and
renders
the
soul
quite
passive
this
accusation
is
also
directed
against
countless
serious
writers
of
accepted
authority
who
are
here
placed
in
the
same
class
with
hobbes
and
spinoza
and
with
some
other
discredited
authors
whose
doctrine
is
considered
odious
and
insupportable
as
for
me
i
do
not
require
the
will
always
to
follow
the
judgement
of
the
understanding
because
i
distinguish
this
judgement
from
the
motives
that
spring
from
insensible
perceptions
and
inclinations
but
i
hold
that
the
will
always
follows
the
most
advantageous
representation
whether
distinct
or
confused
of
the
good
or
the
evil
resulting
from
reasons
passions
and
inclinations
although
it
may
also
find
motives
for
suspending
its
judgement
but
it
is
always
upon
motives
that
it
acts
it
will
be
necessary
to
answer
these
objections
to
my
opinion
before
proceeding
to
establish
that
of
our
author
the
misapprehension
of
my
opponents
originates
in
their
confusing
a
consequence
which
is
necessary
absolutely
whose
contrary
implies
contradiction
with
a
consequence
which
is
founded
only
upon
truths
of
fitness
and
nevertheless
has
its
effect
to
put
it
otherwise
there
is
a
confusion
between
what
depends
upon
the
principle
of
contradiction
which
makes
necessary
and
indispensable
truths
and
what
depends
upon
the
principle
of
the
sufficient
reason
which
applies
also
to
contingent
truths
i
have
already
elsewhere
stated
this
proposition
which
is
one
of
the
most
important
in
philosophy
pointing
out
that
there
are
two
great
principles
namely
of
identicals
or
of
which
states
that
of
two
contradictory
enunciations
the
one
is
true
and
the
other
false
and
of
the
sufficient
which
states
that
there
is
no
true
enunciation
whose
reason
could
not
be
seen
by
one
possessing
all
the
knowledge
necessary
for
its
complete
understanding
both
principles
must
hold
not
only
in
necessary
but
also
in
contingent
truths
and
it
is
even
necessary
that
that
which
has
no
sufficient
reason
should
not
exist
for
one
may
say
in
a
sense
that
these
two
principles
are
contained
in
the
definition
of
the
true
and
the
false
nevertheless
when
in
making
the
analysis
of
the
truth
submitted
one
sees
it
depending
upon
truths
whose
contrary
implies
contradiction
one
may
say
that
it
is
absolutely
necessary
but
when
while
pressing
the
analysis
to
the
furthest
extent
one
can
never
attain
to
such
elements
of
the
given
truth
one
must
say
that
it
is
contingent
and
that
it
originates
from
a
prevailing
reason
which
inclines
without
necessitating
once
that
is
granted
it
is
seen
how
we
can
say
with
sundry
famous
philosophers
and
theologians
that
the
thinking
substance
is
prompted
to
its
resolution
by
the
prevailing
representation
of
good
or
of
evil
and
this
certainly
and
infallibly
but
not
necessarily
that
is
by
reasons
which
incline
it
without
necessitating
it
that
is
why
contingent
futurities
foreseen
both
in
themselves
and
through
their
reasons
remain
contingent
god
was
led
infallibly
by
his
wisdom
and
by
his
goodness
to
create
the
world
through
his
power
and
to
give
it
the
best
possible
form
but
he
was
not
led
thereto
of
necessity
and
the
whole
took
place
without
any
diminution
of
his
perfect
and
supreme
wisdom
and
i
do
not
know
if
it
would
be
easy
apart
from
the
reflexions
we
have
just
entertained
to
untie
the
gordian
knot
of
contingency
and
freedom
this
explanation
dismisses
all
the
objections
of
our
gifted
opponent
in
the
first
place
it
is
seen
that
contingency
exists
together
with
freedom
secondly
evil
wills
are
evil
not
only
because
they
do
harm
but
also
because
they
are
a
source
of
harmful
things
or
of
physical
evils
a
wicked
spirit
being
in
the
sphere
of
its
activity
what
the
evil
principle
of
the
manichaeans
would
be
in
the
universe
moreover
the
author
has
observed
ch
sect
that
divine
wisdom
has
usually
forbidden
actions
which
would
cause
discomforts
that
is
to
say
physical
evils
it
is
agreed
that
he
who
causes
evil
by
necessity
is
not
culpable
but
there
is
neither
legislator
nor
lawyer
who
by
this
necessity
means
the
force
of
the
considerations
of
good
or
evil
real
or
apparent
that
have
prompted
man
to
do
ill
else
anyone
stealing
a
great
sum
of
money
or
killing
a
powerful
man
in
order
to
attain
to
high
office
would
be
less
deserving
of
punishment
than
one
who
should
steal
a
few
halfpence
for
a
mug
of
beer
or
wantonly
kill
his
neighbour
dog
since
these
latter
were
tempted
less
but
it
is
quite
the
opposite
in
the
administration
of
justice
which
is
authorized
in
the
world
for
the
greater
is
the
temptation
to
sin
the
more
does
it
need
to
be
repressed
by
the
fear
of
a
great
chastisement
besides
the
greater
the
calculation
evident
in
the
design
of
an
the
more
will
it
be
found
that
the
wickedness
has
been
deliberate
and
the
more
readily
will
one
decide
that
it
is
great
and
deserving
of
punishment
thus
a
too
artful
fraud
causes
the
aggravating
crime
called
and
a
cheat
becomes
a
forger
when
he
has
the
cunning
to
sap
the
very
foundations
of
our
security
in
written
documents
but
one
will
have
greater
indulgence
for
a
great
passion
because
it
is
nearer
to
madness
the
romans
punished
with
the
utmost
severity
the
priests
of
the
god
apis
when
these
had
prostituted
the
chastity
of
a
noble
lady
to
a
knight
who
loved
her
to
distraction
making
him
pass
as
their
god
while
it
was
found
enough
to
send
the
lover
into
exile
but
if
someone
had
done
evil
deeds
without
apparent
reason
and
without
appearance
of
passion
the
judge
would
be
tempted
to
take
him
for
a
madman
especially
if
it
proved
that
he
was
given
to
committing
such
extravagances
often
this
might
tend
towards
reduction
of
the
penalty
rather
than
supplying
the
true
grounds
of
wickedness
and
punishment
so
far
removed
are
the
principles
of
our
opponents
from
the
practice
of
the
tribunals
and
from
the
general
opinion
of
men
thirdly
the
distinction
between
physical
evil
and
moral
evil
will
still
remain
although
there
be
this
in
common
between
them
that
they
have
their
reasons
and
causes
and
why
manufacture
new
difficulties
for
oneself
concerning
the
origin
of
moral
evil
since
the
principle
followed
in
the
solution
of
those
which
natural
evils
have
raised
suffices
also
to
account
for
voluntary
evils
that
is
to
say
it
suffices
to
show
that
one
could
not
have
prevented
men
from
being
prone
to
errors
without
changing
the
constitution
of
the
best
of
systems
or
without
employing
miracles
at
every
turn
it
is
true
that
sin
makes
up
a
large
portion
of
human
wretchedness
and
even
the
largest
but
that
does
not
prevent
one
from
being
able
to
say
that
men
are
wicked
and
deserving
of
punishment
else
one
must
needs
say
that
the
actual
sins
of
the
are
excusable
because
they
spring
from
the
first
cause
of
our
wretchedness
which
is
original
sin
fourthly
to
say
that
the
soul
becomes
passive
and
that
man
is
not
the
true
cause
of
sin
if
he
is
prompted
to
his
voluntary
actions
by
their
objects
as
our
author
asserts
in
many
passages
and
particularly
ch
sect
is
to
create
for
oneself
new
senses
for
terms
when
the
ancients
spoke
of
that
which
is
greek
eph
hêmin
or
when
we
speak
of
that
which
depends
upon
us
of
spontaneity
of
the
inward
principle
of
our
actions
we
do
not
exclude
the
representation
of
external
things
for
these
representations
are
in
our
souls
they
are
a
portion
of
the
modifications
of
this
active
principle
which
is
within
us
no
agent
is
capable
of
acting
without
being
to
what
the
action
demands
and
the
reasons
or
inclinations
derived
from
good
or
evil
are
the
dispositions
that
enable
the
soul
to
decide
between
various
courses
one
will
have
it
that
the
will
is
alone
active
and
supreme
and
one
is
wont
to
imagine
it
to
be
like
a
queen
seated
on
her
throne
whose
minister
of
state
is
the
understanding
while
the
passions
are
her
courtiers
or
favourite
ladies
who
by
their
influence
often
prevail
over
the
counsel
of
her
ministers
one
will
have
it
that
the
understanding
speaks
only
at
this
queen
order
that
she
can
vacillate
between
the
arguments
of
the
minister
and
the
suggestions
of
the
favourites
even
rejecting
both
making
them
keep
silence
or
speak
and
giving
them
audience
or
not
as
seems
good
to
her
but
it
is
a
personification
or
mythology
somewhat
if
the
will
is
to
judge
or
take
cognizance
of
the
reasons
and
inclinations
which
the
understanding
or
the
senses
offer
it
it
will
need
another
understanding
in
itself
to
understand
what
it
is
offered
the
truth
is
that
the
soul
or
the
thinking
substance
understands
the
reasons
and
feels
the
inclinations
and
decides
according
to
the
predominance
of
the
representations
modifying
its
active
force
in
order
to
shape
the
action
i
have
no
need
here
to
apply
my
system
of
harmony
which
shows
our
independence
to
the
best
advantage
and
frees
us
from
the
physical
influence
of
objects
for
what
i
have
just
said
is
sufficient
to
answer
the
objection
our
author
even
though
he
admits
with
people
in
general
this
physical
influence
of
objects
upon
us
observes
nevertheless
with
much
perspicacity
that
the
body
or
the
objects
of
the
senses
do
not
even
give
us
our
ideas
much
less
the
active
force
of
our
soul
and
that
they
serve
only
to
draw
out
that
which
is
within
us
this
is
much
in
the
spirit
of
belief
that
the
soul
not
being
able
to
give
force
to
the
body
gives
it
at
least
some
direction
it
is
a
mean
between
one
side
and
the
other
between
physical
influence
and
harmony
fifthly
the
objection
is
made
that
according
to
my
opinion
sin
would
neither
be
censured
nor
punished
because
of
its
deserts
but
because
the
censure
and
the
chastisement
serve
to
prevent
it
another
time
whereas
men
demand
something
more
namely
satisfaction
for
the
crime
even
though
it
should
serve
neither
for
amendment
nor
for
example
so
do
men
with
reason
demand
that
true
gratitude
should
come
from
a
true
recognition
of
the
past
benefit
and
not
from
the
interested
aim
of
extorting
a
fresh
benefit
this
objection
contains
noble
and
sound
considerations
but
it
does
not
strike
at
me
i
require
a
man
to
be
virtuous
grateful
just
not
only
from
the
motive
of
interest
of
hope
or
of
fear
but
also
of
the
pleasure
that
he
should
find
in
good
actions
else
one
has
not
yet
reached
the
degree
of
virtue
that
one
must
endeavour
to
attain
that
is
what
one
means
by
saying
that
justice
and
virtue
must
be
loved
for
their
own
sake
and
it
is
also
what
i
explained
in
justifying
love
shortly
before
the
opening
of
the
controversy
which
caused
so
much
stir
likewise
i
consider
that
wickedness
is
all
the
greater
when
its
practice
becomes
a
pleasure
as
when
a
highwayman
after
having
killed
men
because
they
resist
or
because
he
fears
their
vengeance
finally
grows
cruel
and
takes
pleasure
in
killing
them
and
even
in
making
them
suffer
beforehand
such
a
degree
of
wickedness
is
taken
to
be
diabolical
even
though
the
man
affected
with
it
finds
in
this
execrable
indulgence
a
stronger
reason
for
his
homicides
than
he
had
when
he
killed
simply
under
the
influence
of
hope
or
of
fear
i
have
also
observed
in
answering
the
difficulties
of
bayle
that
according
to
the
celebrated
conringius
justice
which
punishes
by
means
of
penalties
so
to
speak
that
is
in
order
to
correct
the
criminal
or
at
least
to
provide
an
example
for
others
might
exist
in
the
opinion
of
those
who
do
away
with
the
freedom
that
is
exempt
from
necessity
true
retributive
justice
on
the
other
hand
going
beyond
the
medicinal
assumes
something
more
namely
intelligence
and
freedom
in
him
who
sins
because
the
harmony
of
things
demands
a
satisfaction
or
evil
in
the
form
of
suffering
to
make
the
mind
feel
its
error
after
the
voluntary
active
evil
whereto
it
has
consented
hobbes
also
who
does
away
with
freedom
has
rejected
retributive
justice
as
do
the
socinians
drawing
on
themselves
the
condemnation
of
our
theologians
although
the
writers
of
the
socinian
party
are
wont
to
exaggerate
the
idea
of
freedom
sixthly
the
objection
is
finally
made
that
men
can
not
hope
for
felicity
if
the
will
can
only
be
actuated
by
the
representation
of
good
and
evil
but
this
objection
seems
to
me
completely
null
and
void
and
i
think
it
would
be
hard
to
guess
how
any
tolerable
interpretation
was
ever
put
upon
it
moreover
the
line
of
reasoning
adopted
to
prove
it
is
of
a
most
astounding
nature
it
is
that
our
felicity
depends
upon
external
things
if
it
is
true
that
it
depends
upon
the
representation
of
good
or
evil
it
is
therefore
not
in
our
own
power
so
it
is
said
for
we
have
no
ground
for
hoping
that
outward
things
will
arrange
themselves
for
our
pleasure
this
argument
is
halting
from
every
aspect
is
no
force
in
the
inference
one
might
grant
the
conclusion
the
argument
may
be
retorted
upon
the
let
us
begin
with
the
retort
which
is
easy
for
are
men
any
happier
or
more
independent
of
the
accidents
of
fortune
upon
this
argument
or
because
they
are
credited
with
the
advantage
of
choosing
without
reason
have
they
less
bodily
suffering
have
they
less
tendency
toward
true
or
apparent
goods
less
fear
of
true
or
imaginary
evils
are
they
any
less
enslaved
by
sensual
pleasure
by
ambition
by
avarice
less
apprehensive
less
envious
yes
our
gifted
author
will
say
i
will
prove
it
by
a
method
of
counting
or
assessment
i
would
rather
he
had
proved
it
by
experience
but
let
us
see
this
proof
by
counting
suppose
that
by
my
choice
which
enables
me
to
give
to
that
which
i
choose
i
give
to
the
object
chosen
six
degrees
of
goodness
when
previously
there
were
two
degrees
of
evil
in
my
condition
i
shall
become
happy
all
at
once
and
with
perfect
ease
for
i
should
have
four
degrees
surplus
or
net
good
doubtless
that
is
all
very
well
but
unfortunately
it
is
impossible
for
what
possibility
is
there
of
giving
these
six
degrees
of
goodness
to
the
object
to
that
end
we
must
needs
have
the
power
to
change
our
taste
or
the
things
as
we
please
that
would
be
almost
as
if
i
could
say
to
lead
thou
shalt
be
gold
and
make
it
so
to
the
pebble
thou
shalt
be
diamond
or
at
the
least
thou
shalt
look
like
it
or
it
would
be
like
the
common
explanation
of
the
mosaical
passage
which
seems
to
say
that
the
desert
manna
assumed
any
taste
the
israelites
desired
to
give
to
it
they
only
had
to
say
to
their
homerful
thou
shalt
be
a
capon
thou
shalt
be
a
partridge
but
if
i
am
free
to
give
these
six
degrees
of
goodness
to
the
object
am
i
not
permitted
to
give
it
more
goodness
i
think
that
i
am
but
if
that
is
so
why
shall
we
not
give
to
the
object
all
the
goodness
conceivable
why
shall
we
not
even
go
as
far
as
carats
of
goodness
by
this
means
behold
us
completely
happy
despite
the
accidents
of
fortune
it
may
blow
hail
or
snow
and
we
shall
not
mind
by
means
of
this
splendid
secret
we
shall
be
always
shielded
against
fortuitous
events
the
author
agrees
in
this
first
section
of
the
fifth
chapter
that
this
power
overcomes
all
the
natural
appetites
and
can
not
be
overcome
by
any
of
them
and
he
regards
it
as
the
soundest
foundation
for
happiness
indeed
since
there
is
nothing
capable
of
limiting
a
power
so
indeterminate
as
that
of
choosing
without
any
reason
and
of
giving
goodness
to
the
object
through
the
choice
either
this
goodness
must
exceed
infinitely
that
which
the
natural
appetites
seek
in
objects
these
appetites
and
objects
being
limited
while
this
power
is
independent
or
at
the
least
this
goodness
given
by
the
will
to
the
chosen
object
must
be
arbitrary
and
of
such
a
kind
as
the
will
desires
for
whence
would
one
derive
the
reason
for
limits
if
the
object
is
possible
if
it
is
within
reach
of
him
who
wills
and
if
the
will
can
give
it
the
goodness
it
desires
to
give
independently
of
reality
and
of
appearances
it
seems
to
me
that
may
suffice
to
overthrow
a
hypothesis
so
precarious
which
contains
something
of
a
kind
ista
sunt
non
it
therefore
remains
only
too
true
that
this
handsome
fiction
can
not
render
us
more
immune
from
evils
and
we
shall
see
presently
that
when
men
place
themselves
above
certain
desires
or
certain
aversions
they
do
so
through
other
desires
which
always
have
their
foundation
in
the
representation
of
good
and
evil
i
said
also
one
might
grant
the
conclusion
of
the
argument
which
states
that
our
happiness
does
not
depend
absolutely
upon
ourselves
at
least
in
the
present
state
of
human
life
for
who
would
question
the
fact
that
we
are
liable
to
meet
a
thousand
accidents
which
human
prudence
can
not
evade
how
for
example
can
i
avoid
being
swallowed
up
together
with
a
town
where
i
take
up
my
abode
by
an
earthquake
if
such
is
the
order
of
things
but
finally
i
can
also
deny
the
inference
in
the
argument
which
states
that
if
the
will
is
only
actuated
by
the
representation
of
good
and
evil
our
happiness
does
not
depend
upon
ourselves
the
inference
would
be
valid
if
there
were
no
god
if
everything
were
ruled
by
brute
causes
but
god
ordinance
is
that
for
the
attainment
of
happiness
it
suffices
that
one
be
virtuous
thus
if
the
soul
follows
reason
and
the
orders
that
god
has
given
it
it
is
assured
of
its
happiness
even
though
one
may
not
find
a
sufficiency
thereof
in
this
life
having
thus
endeavoured
to
point
out
the
disadvantages
of
my
hypothesis
our
gifted
author
sets
forth
the
advantages
of
his
own
he
believes
that
it
alone
is
capable
of
saving
our
freedom
that
all
our
felicity
rests
therein
that
it
increases
our
goods
and
lessens
our
evils
and
that
an
agent
possessing
this
power
is
so
much
the
more
complete
these
advantages
have
almost
all
been
already
disproved
we
have
shown
that
for
the
securing
of
our
freedom
it
is
enough
that
the
representations
of
goods
and
of
evils
and
other
inward
or
outward
dispositions
should
incline
us
without
constraining
us
moreover
one
does
not
see
how
pure
indifference
can
contribute
to
felicity
on
the
contrary
the
more
indifferent
one
is
the
more
insensitive
and
the
less
capable
of
enjoying
what
is
good
will
one
prove
to
be
besides
the
hypothesis
proves
too
much
for
if
an
indifferent
power
could
give
itself
the
consciousness
of
good
it
could
also
give
itself
the
most
perfect
happiness
as
has
been
already
shown
and
it
is
manifest
that
there
is
nothing
which
would
set
limits
to
that
power
since
limits
would
withdraw
it
from
its
pure
indifference
whence
so
our
author
alleges
it
only
emerges
of
itself
or
rather
wherein
it
has
never
been
finally
one
does
not
see
wherein
the
perfection
of
pure
indifference
lies
on
the
contrary
there
is
nothing
more
imperfect
it
would
render
knowledge
and
goodness
futile
and
would
reduce
everything
to
chance
with
no
rules
and
no
measures
that
could
be
taken
there
are
however
still
some
advantages
adduced
by
our
author
which
have
not
been
discussed
he
considers
then
that
by
this
power
alone
are
we
the
true
cause
to
which
our
actions
can
be
imputed
since
otherwise
we
should
be
under
the
compulsion
of
external
objects
likewise
that
by
this
power
alone
can
one
ascribe
to
oneself
the
merit
of
one
own
felicity
and
feel
pleased
with
oneself
but
the
exact
opposite
is
the
case
for
when
one
happens
upon
the
action
through
an
absolutely
indifferent
movement
and
not
as
a
result
of
one
good
or
bad
qualities
is
it
not
just
as
though
one
were
to
happen
upon
it
blindly
by
chance
or
hazard
why
then
should
one
boast
of
a
good
action
or
why
should
one
be
censured
for
an
evil
one
if
the
thanks
or
blame
redounds
to
fortune
or
hazard
i
think
that
one
is
more
worthy
of
praise
when
one
owes
the
action
to
one
good
qualities
and
the
more
culpable
in
proportion
as
one
has
been
impelled
to
it
by
one
evil
qualities
to
attempt
to
assess
actions
without
weighing
the
qualities
whence
they
spring
is
to
talk
at
random
and
to
put
an
imaginary
indefinable
something
in
the
place
of
causes
thus
if
this
chance
or
this
indefinable
something
were
the
cause
of
our
actions
to
the
exclusion
of
our
natural
or
acquired
qualities
of
our
inclinations
of
our
habits
it
would
not
be
possible
to
set
one
hopes
upon
anything
depending
upon
the
resolve
of
others
since
it
would
not
be
possible
to
fix
something
indefinite
or
to
conjecture
into
what
roadstead
the
uncertain
weather
of
an
extravagant
indifference
will
drive
the
vessel
of
the
will
but
setting
aside
advantages
and
disadvantages
let
us
see
how
our
learned
author
will
justify
the
hypothesis
from
which
he
promises
us
so
much
good
he
imagines
that
it
is
only
god
and
the
free
creatures
who
are
active
in
the
true
sense
and
that
in
order
to
be
active
one
must
be
determined
by
oneself
only
now
that
which
is
determined
by
itself
must
not
be
determined
by
objects
and
consequently
the
free
substance
in
so
far
as
it
is
free
must
be
indifferent
with
regard
to
objects
and
emerge
from
this
indifference
only
by
its
own
choice
which
shall
render
the
object
pleasing
to
it
but
almost
all
the
stages
of
this
argument
have
their
not
only
the
free
creatures
but
also
all
the
other
substances
and
natures
composed
of
substances
are
active
beasts
are
not
free
and
yet
all
the
same
they
have
active
souls
unless
one
assume
with
the
cartesians
that
they
are
mere
machines
moreover
it
is
not
necessary
that
in
order
to
be
active
one
should
be
determined
only
by
oneself
since
a
thing
may
receive
direction
without
receiving
force
so
it
is
that
the
horse
is
controlled
by
the
rider
and
the
vessel
is
steered
by
the
helm
and
descartes
belief
was
that
our
body
having
force
in
itself
receives
only
some
direction
from
the
soul
thus
an
active
thing
may
receive
from
outside
some
determination
or
direction
capable
of
changing
that
direction
which
it
would
take
of
itself
finally
even
though
an
active
substance
is
determined
only
by
itself
it
does
not
follow
that
it
is
not
moved
by
objects
for
it
is
the
representation
of
the
object
within
it
which
contributes
towards
the
determination
now
the
representation
does
not
come
from
without
and
consequently
there
is
complete
spontaneity
objects
do
not
act
upon
intelligent
substances
as
efficient
and
physical
causes
but
as
final
and
moral
causes
when
god
acts
in
accordance
with
his
wisdom
he
is
guided
by
the
ideas
of
the
possibles
which
are
his
objects
but
which
have
no
reality
outside
him
before
their
actual
creation
thus
this
kind
of
spiritual
and
moral
motion
is
not
contrary
to
the
activity
of
the
substance
nor
to
the
spontaneity
of
its
action
finally
even
though
free
power
were
not
determined
by
the
objects
it
can
never
be
indifferent
to
the
action
when
it
is
on
the
point
of
acting
since
the
action
must
have
its
origin
in
a
disposition
to
act
otherwise
one
will
do
anything
from
anything
ex
and
there
will
be
nothing
too
absurd
for
us
to
imagine
but
this
disposition
will
have
already
broken
the
charm
of
mere
indifference
and
if
the
soul
gives
itself
this
disposition
there
must
needs
be
another
predisposition
for
this
act
of
giving
it
consequently
however
far
back
one
may
go
one
will
never
meet
with
a
mere
indifference
in
the
soul
towards
the
actions
which
it
is
to
perform
it
is
true
that
these
dispositions
incline
it
without
constraining
it
they
relate
usually
to
the
objects
but
there
are
some
notwithstanding
which
arise
variously
or
from
the
soul
itself
and
which
bring
it
about
that
one
object
is
more
acceptable
than
the
other
or
that
the
same
is
more
acceptable
at
one
time
than
at
another
our
author
continually
assures
us
that
his
hypothesis
is
true
and
he
undertakes
to
show
that
this
indifferent
power
is
indeed
found
in
god
and
even
that
it
must
be
attributed
to
him
of
necessity
for
he
says
nothing
is
to
god
either
good
or
bad
in
creatures
he
has
no
natural
appetite
to
be
satisfied
by
the
enjoyment
of
anything
outside
him
he
is
therefore
absolutely
indifferent
to
all
external
things
since
by
them
he
can
neither
be
helped
nor
hindered
and
he
must
determine
himself
and
create
as
it
were
an
appetite
in
making
his
choice
and
having
once
chosen
he
will
wish
to
abide
by
his
choice
just
as
if
he
had
been
prompted
thereto
by
a
natural
inclination
thus
will
the
divine
will
be
the
cause
of
goodness
in
beings
that
is
to
say
there
will
be
goodness
in
the
objects
not
by
their
nature
but
by
the
will
of
god
whereas
if
that
will
be
excluded
neither
good
nor
evil
can
exist
in
things
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
how
writers
of
merit
could
have
been
misled
by
so
strange
an
opinion
for
the
reason
which
appears
to
be
advanced
here
has
not
the
slightest
force
it
seems
to
me
as
though
an
attempt
is
being
made
to
justify
this
opinion
by
the
consideration
that
all
creatures
have
their
whole
being
from
god
so
that
they
can
not
act
upon
him
or
determine
him
but
this
is
clearly
an
instance
of
when
we
say
that
an
intelligent
substance
is
actuated
by
the
goodness
of
its
object
we
do
not
assert
that
this
object
is
necessarily
a
being
existing
outside
the
substance
and
it
is
enough
for
us
that
it
be
conceivable
for
its
representation
acts
in
the
substance
or
rather
the
substance
acts
upon
itself
in
so
far
as
it
is
disposed
and
influenced
by
this
representation
with
god
it
is
plain
that
his
understanding
contains
the
ideas
of
all
possible
things
and
that
is
how
everything
is
in
him
in
a
transcendent
manner
these
ideas
represent
to
him
the
good
and
evil
the
perfection
and
imperfection
the
order
and
disorder
the
congruity
and
incongruity
of
possibles
and
his
superabundant
goodness
makes
him
choose
the
most
advantageous
god
therefore
determines
himself
by
himself
his
will
acts
by
virtue
of
his
goodness
but
it
is
particularized
and
directed
in
action
by
understanding
filled
with
wisdom
and
since
his
understanding
is
perfect
since
his
thoughts
are
always
clear
his
inclinations
always
good
he
never
fails
to
do
the
best
whereas
we
may
be
deceived
by
the
mere
semblances
of
truth
and
goodness
but
how
is
it
possible
for
it
to
be
said
that
there
is
no
good
or
evil
in
the
ideas
before
the
operation
of
god
will
does
the
will
of
god
form
the
ideas
which
are
in
his
understanding
i
dare
not
ascribe
to
our
learned
author
so
strange
a
sentiment
which
would
confuse
understanding
and
will
and
would
subvert
the
current
use
of
our
notions
now
if
ideas
are
independent
of
will
the
perfection
or
imperfection
which
is
represented
in
them
will
be
independent
also
indeed
is
it
by
the
will
of
god
for
example
or
is
it
not
rather
by
the
nature
of
numbers
that
certain
numbers
allow
more
than
others
of
various
exact
divisions
that
some
are
more
fitted
than
others
for
forming
battalions
composing
polygons
and
other
regular
figures
that
the
number
six
has
the
advantage
of
being
the
least
of
all
the
numbers
that
are
called
perfect
that
in
a
plane
six
equal
circles
may
touch
a
seventh
that
of
all
equal
bodies
the
sphere
has
the
least
surface
that
certain
lines
are
incommensurable
and
consequently
for
harmony
do
we
not
see
that
all
these
advantages
or
disadvantages
spring
from
the
idea
of
the
thing
and
that
the
contrary
would
imply
contradiction
can
it
be
thought
that
the
pain
and
discomfort
of
sentient
creatures
and
above
all
the
happiness
and
unhappiness
of
intelligent
substances
are
a
matter
of
indifference
to
god
and
what
shall
be
said
of
his
justice
is
it
also
something
arbitrary
and
would
he
have
acted
wisely
and
justly
if
he
had
resolved
to
condemn
the
innocent
i
know
that
there
have
been
writers
so
as
to
maintain
an
opinion
so
dangerous
and
so
liable
to
overthrow
religion
but
i
am
assured
that
our
illustrious
author
is
far
from
holding
it
nevertheless
it
seems
as
though
this
hypothesis
tends
in
that
direction
if
there
is
nothing
in
objects
save
what
is
indifferent
to
the
divine
will
before
its
choice
it
is
true
that
god
has
need
of
nothing
but
the
author
has
himself
shown
clearly
that
god
goodness
and
not
his
need
prompted
him
to
produce
creatures
there
was
therefore
in
him
a
reason
anterior
to
the
resolution
and
as
i
have
said
so
many
times
it
was
neither
by
chance
nor
without
cause
nor
even
by
necessity
that
god
created
this
world
but
rather
as
a
result
of
his
inclination
which
always
prompts
him
to
the
best
thus
it
is
surprising
that
our
author
should
assert
here
ch
sect
that
there
is
no
reason
which
could
have
induced
god
absolutely
perfect
and
happy
in
himself
to
create
anything
outside
him
although
according
to
the
author
previous
declarations
ch
sect
god
acts
for
an
end
and
his
aim
is
to
communicate
his
goodness
it
was
therefore
not
altogether
a
matter
of
indifference
to
him
whether
he
should
create
or
not
create
and
creation
is
notwithstanding
a
free
act
nor
was
it
a
matter
of
indifference
to
him
either
whether
he
should
create
one
world
rather
than
another
a
perpetual
chaos
or
a
completely
ordered
system
thus
the
qualities
of
objects
included
in
their
ideas
formed
the
reason
for
choice
our
author
having
already
spoken
so
admirably
about
the
beauty
and
fittingness
of
the
works
of
god
has
tried
to
search
out
phrases
that
would
reconcile
them
with
his
hypothesis
which
appears
to
deprive
god
of
all
consideration
for
the
good
or
the
advantage
of
creatures
the
indifference
of
god
prevails
he
says
only
in
his
first
elections
but
as
soon
as
god
has
chosen
something
he
has
virtually
chosen
at
the
same
time
all
that
which
is
of
necessity
connected
therewith
there
were
innumerable
possible
men
equally
perfect
the
election
of
some
from
among
them
is
purely
arbitrary
in
the
judgement
of
our
author
but
god
once
having
chosen
them
could
not
have
willed
in
them
anything
contrary
to
human
nature
up
to
this
point
the
author
words
are
consistent
with
his
hypothesis
but
those
that
follow
go
further
he
advances
the
proposition
that
when
god
resolved
to
produce
certain
creatures
he
resolved
at
the
same
time
by
virtue
of
his
infinite
goodness
to
give
them
every
possible
advantage
nothing
indeed
could
be
so
reasonable
but
also
nothing
could
be
so
contrary
to
the
hypothesis
he
has
put
forward
and
he
does
right
to
overthrow
it
rather
than
prolong
the
existence
of
anything
so
charged
with
incongruities
incompatible
with
the
goodness
and
wisdom
of
god
here
is
the
way
to
see
plainly
that
this
hypothesis
can
not
harmonize
with
what
has
just
been
said
the
first
question
will
be
will
god
create
something
or
not
and
wherefore
the
author
has
answered
that
he
will
create
something
in
order
to
communicate
his
goodness
it
is
therefore
no
matter
of
indifference
to
him
whether
he
shall
create
or
not
next
the
question
is
asked
will
god
create
such
and
such
a
thing
and
wherefore
one
must
needs
answer
to
speak
consistently
that
the
same
goodness
makes
him
choose
the
best
and
indeed
the
author
falls
back
on
that
subsequently
but
following
his
own
hypothesis
he
answers
that
god
will
create
such
a
thing
but
that
there
is
no
because
god
is
absolutely
indifferent
towards
creatures
who
have
their
goodness
only
from
his
choice
it
is
true
that
our
author
varies
somewhat
on
this
point
for
he
says
here
ch
sect
that
god
is
indifferent
to
the
choice
between
men
of
equal
perfection
or
between
equally
perfect
kinds
of
rational
creatures
thus
according
to
this
form
of
expression
he
would
choose
rather
the
more
perfect
kind
and
as
kinds
that
are
of
equal
perfection
harmonize
more
or
less
with
others
god
will
choose
those
that
agree
best
together
there
will
therefore
be
no
pure
and
absolute
indifference
and
the
author
thus
comes
back
to
my
principles
but
let
us
speak
as
he
speaks
in
accordance
with
his
hypothesis
and
let
us
assume
with
him
that
god
chooses
certain
creatures
even
though
he
be
absolutely
indifferent
towards
them
he
will
then
just
as
soon
choose
creatures
that
are
irregular
mischievous
unhappy
chaos
everlasting
monsters
everywhere
scoundrels
as
sole
inhabitants
of
the
earth
devils
filling
the
whole
universe
all
this
rather
than
excellent
systems
shapely
forms
upright
persons
good
angels
no
the
author
will
say
god
when
once
he
had
resolved
to
create
men
resolved
at
the
same
time
to
give
them
all
the
advantages
possible
in
the
world
and
it
is
the
same
with
regard
to
creatures
of
other
kinds
i
answer
that
if
this
advantage
were
connected
of
necessity
with
their
nature
the
author
would
be
speaking
in
accordance
with
his
hypothesis
that
not
being
so
however
he
must
admit
that
resolve
to
give
every
possible
advantage
to
men
arises
from
a
new
election
independent
of
that
one
which
prompted
god
to
make
men
but
whence
comes
this
new
election
does
it
also
come
from
mere
indifference
if
such
is
the
case
nothing
prompts
god
to
seek
the
good
of
men
and
if
he
sometimes
comes
to
do
it
it
will
be
merely
by
accident
but
the
author
maintains
that
god
was
prompted
to
the
choice
by
his
goodness
therefore
the
good
and
ill
of
creatures
is
no
matter
of
indifference
to
him
and
there
are
in
him
primary
choices
to
which
the
goodness
of
the
object
prompts
him
he
chooses
not
only
to
create
men
but
also
to
create
men
as
happy
as
it
is
possible
to
be
in
this
system
after
that
not
the
least
vestige
of
mere
indifference
will
be
left
for
we
can
reason
concerning
the
entire
world
just
as
we
have
reasoned
concerning
the
human
race
god
resolved
to
create
a
world
but
he
was
bound
by
his
goodness
at
the
same
time
to
make
choice
of
such
a
world
as
should
contain
the
greatest
possible
amount
of
order
regularity
virtue
happiness
for
i
can
see
no
excuse
for
saying
that
whereas
god
was
prompted
by
his
goodness
to
make
the
men
he
has
resolved
to
create
as
perfect
as
is
possible
within
this
system
he
had
not
the
same
good
intention
towards
the
whole
universe
there
we
have
come
back
again
to
the
goodness
of
the
objects
and
pure
indifference
where
god
would
act
without
cause
is
altogether
destroyed
by
the
very
procedure
of
our
gifted
author
with
whom
the
force
of
truth
once
the
heart
of
the
matter
was
reached
prevailed
over
a
speculative
hypothesis
which
can
not
admit
of
any
application
to
the
reality
of
things
since
therefore
nothing
is
altogether
indifferent
to
god
who
knows
all
degrees
all
effects
all
relations
of
things
and
who
penetrates
at
one
and
the
same
time
all
their
possible
connexions
let
us
see
whether
at
least
the
ignorance
and
insensibility
of
man
can
make
him
absolutely
indifferent
in
his
choice
the
author
regales
us
with
this
pure
indifference
as
with
a
handsome
present
here
are
the
proofs
of
it
which
he
gives
we
feel
it
within
us
we
have
experience
within
ourselves
of
its
marks
and
its
properties
we
can
show
that
other
causes
which
might
determine
our
will
are
insufficient
as
for
the
first
point
he
asserts
that
in
feeling
freedom
within
us
we
feel
within
us
at
the
same
time
pure
indifference
but
i
do
not
agree
that
we
feel
such
indifference
or
that
this
alleged
feeling
follows
upon
that
of
freedom
we
feel
usually
within
us
something
which
inclines
us
to
our
choice
at
times
it
happens
however
that
we
can
not
account
for
all
our
dispositions
if
we
give
our
mind
to
the
question
we
shall
recognize
that
the
constitution
of
our
body
and
of
bodies
in
our
environment
the
present
or
previous
temper
of
our
soul
together
with
countless
small
things
included
under
these
comprehensive
headings
may
contribute
towards
our
greater
or
lesser
predilection
for
certain
objects
and
the
variation
of
our
opinions
from
one
time
to
another
at
the
same
time
we
shall
recognize
that
none
would
attribute
this
to
mere
indifference
or
to
some
indefinable
force
of
the
soul
which
has
the
same
effect
upon
objects
as
colours
are
said
to
have
upon
the
chameleon
thus
the
author
has
no
cause
here
to
appeal
to
the
judgement
of
the
people
he
does
so
saying
that
in
many
things
the
people
reason
better
than
the
philosophers
it
is
true
that
certain
philosophers
have
been
misled
by
chimeras
and
it
would
seem
that
mere
indifference
is
numbered
among
chimerical
notions
but
when
someone
maintains
that
a
thing
does
not
exist
because
the
common
herd
does
not
perceive
it
here
the
populace
can
not
be
regarded
as
a
good
judge
being
as
it
is
only
guided
by
the
senses
many
people
think
that
air
is
nothing
when
it
is
not
stirred
by
the
wind
the
majority
do
not
know
of
imperceptible
bodies
the
fluid
which
causes
weight
or
elasticity
magnetic
matter
to
say
nothing
of
atoms
and
other
indivisible
substances
do
we
say
then
that
these
things
are
not
because
the
common
herd
does
not
know
of
them
if
so
we
shall
be
able
to
say
also
that
the
soul
acts
sometimes
without
any
disposition
or
inclination
contributing
towards
the
production
of
its
act
because
there
are
many
dispositions
and
inclinations
which
are
not
sufficiently
perceived
by
the
common
herd
for
lack
of
attention
and
thought
secondly
as
to
the
marks
of
the
power
in
question
i
have
already
refuted
the
claim
advanced
for
it
that
it
possesses
the
advantage
of
making
one
active
the
real
cause
of
one
action
and
subject
to
responsibility
and
morality
these
are
not
genuine
marks
of
its
existence
here
is
one
the
author
adduces
which
is
not
genuine
either
namely
that
we
have
within
us
a
power
of
resisting
natural
appetites
that
is
to
say
of
resisting
not
only
the
senses
but
also
the
reason
but
i
have
already
stated
this
fact
one
resists
natural
appetites
through
other
natural
appetites
one
sometimes
endures
inconveniences
and
is
happy
to
do
so
but
that
is
on
account
of
some
hope
or
of
some
satisfaction
which
is
combined
with
the
ill
and
exceeds
it
either
one
anticipates
good
from
it
or
one
finds
good
in
it
the
author
asserts
that
it
is
through
that
power
to
transform
appearances
which
he
has
introduced
on
the
scene
that
we
render
agreeable
what
at
first
displeased
us
but
who
can
not
see
that
the
true
reason
is
that
application
and
attention
to
the
object
and
custom
change
our
disposition
and
consequently
our
natural
appetites
once
we
become
used
to
a
rather
high
degree
of
cold
or
heat
it
no
longer
incommodes
us
as
it
formerly
did
and
yet
no
one
would
ascribe
this
effect
to
our
power
of
choice
time
is
needed
for
instance
to
bring
about
that
hardening
or
rather
that
callosity
which
enables
the
hands
of
certain
workmen
to
resist
a
degree
of
heat
that
would
burn
our
hands
the
populace
whom
the
author
invokes
guess
correctly
the
cause
of
this
effect
although
they
sometimes
apply
it
in
a
laughable
manner
two
being
close
to
the
fire
in
the
kitchen
one
who
has
burnt
herself
says
to
the
other
oh
my
dear
who
will
be
able
to
endure
the
fire
of
purgatory
the
other
answers
do
be
absurd
my
good
woman
one
grows
used
to
everything
but
the
author
will
say
this
wonderful
power
which
causes
us
to
be
indifferent
to
everything
or
inclined
towards
everything
simply
at
our
own
free
will
prevails
over
reason
itself
and
this
is
his
third
proof
namely
that
one
can
not
sufficiently
explain
our
actions
without
having
recourse
to
this
power
one
sees
numbers
of
people
despising
the
entreaties
of
their
friends
the
counsels
of
their
neighbours
the
reproaches
of
their
conscience
discomforts
tortures
death
the
wrath
of
god
hell
itself
for
the
sake
of
running
after
follies
which
have
no
claim
to
be
good
or
tolerable
save
as
being
freely
chosen
by
such
people
all
is
well
in
this
argument
with
the
exception
of
the
last
words
only
for
when
one
takes
an
actual
instance
one
will
find
that
there
were
reasons
or
causes
which
led
the
man
to
his
choice
and
that
there
are
very
strong
bonds
to
fasten
him
thereto
a
for
example
will
never
have
arisen
from
mere
indifference
inclination
or
passion
will
have
played
its
part
but
habit
and
stubbornness
will
cause
certain
natures
to
face
ruin
rather
than
separation
from
the
beloved
here
is
another
example
cited
by
the
author
an
atheist
a
man
like
lucilio
vanini
that
is
what
many
people
call
him
whereas
he
himself
adopts
the
magnificent
name
of
giulio
cesare
vanini
in
his
works
will
suffer
a
preposterous
martyrdom
for
his
chimera
rather
than
renounce
his
impiety
the
author
does
not
name
vanini
and
the
truth
is
that
this
man
repudiated
his
wrong
opinions
until
he
was
convicted
of
having
published
atheistical
dogmas
and
acted
as
an
apostle
of
atheism
when
he
was
asked
whether
there
was
a
god
he
plucked
some
grass
saying
levis
est
cespes
qui
probet
esse
but
since
the
attorney
general
to
the
parliament
of
toulouse
desired
to
cause
annoyance
to
the
first
president
so
it
is
said
to
whom
vanini
was
granted
considerable
access
teaching
his
children
philosophy
if
indeed
he
was
not
altogether
in
the
service
of
that
magistrate
the
inquisition
was
carried
through
rigorously
vanini
seeing
that
there
was
no
chance
of
pardon
declared
himself
when
at
the
point
of
death
for
what
he
was
an
atheist
and
there
was
nothing
very
extraordinary
in
that
but
supposing
there
were
an
atheist
who
gave
himself
up
for
torture
vanity
might
be
in
his
case
a
strong
enough
motive
as
in
that
of
the
gymnosophist
calanus
and
of
the
sophist
who
according
to
lucian
account
was
burnt
to
death
of
his
own
will
but
the
author
thinks
that
that
very
vanity
that
stubbornness
those
other
wild
intentions
of
persons
who
otherwise
seem
to
have
quite
good
sense
can
not
be
explained
by
the
appetites
that
arise
from
the
representation
of
good
and
evil
and
that
they
compel
us
to
have
recourse
to
that
transcendent
power
which
transforms
good
into
evil
and
evil
into
good
and
the
indifferent
into
good
or
into
evil
but
we
do
not
need
to
go
so
far
and
the
causes
of
our
errors
are
only
too
visible
indeed
we
can
make
these
transformations
but
it
is
not
as
with
the
fairies
by
a
mere
act
of
this
magic
power
but
by
obscuring
and
suppressing
in
one
mind
the
representations
of
good
or
bad
qualities
which
are
naturally
attached
to
certain
objects
and
by
contemplating
only
such
representations
as
conform
to
our
taste
or
our
prejudices
or
again
because
one
attaches
to
the
objects
by
dint
of
thinking
of
them
certain
qualities
which
are
connected
with
them
only
accidentally
or
through
our
habitual
contemplation
of
them
for
example
all
my
life
long
i
detest
a
certain
kind
of
good
food
because
in
my
childhood
i
found
in
it
something
distasteful
which
made
a
strong
impression
upon
me
on
the
other
hand
a
certain
natural
defect
will
be
pleasing
to
me
because
it
will
revive
within
me
to
some
extent
the
thought
of
a
person
i
used
to
esteem
or
love
a
young
man
will
have
been
delighted
by
the
applause
which
has
been
showered
upon
him
after
some
successful
public
action
the
impression
of
this
great
pleasure
will
have
made
him
remarkably
sensitive
to
reputation
he
will
think
day
and
night
of
nothing
save
what
nourishes
this
passion
and
that
will
cause
him
to
scorn
death
itself
in
order
to
attain
his
end
for
although
he
may
know
very
well
that
he
will
not
feel
what
is
said
of
him
after
his
death
the
representation
he
makes
of
it
for
himself
beforehand
creates
a
strong
impression
on
his
mind
and
there
are
always
motives
of
the
same
kind
in
actions
which
appear
most
useless
and
absurd
to
those
who
do
not
enter
into
these
motives
in
a
word
a
strong
or
impression
may
alter
considerably
our
organs
our
imagination
our
memory
and
even
our
reasoning
it
happens
that
a
man
by
dint
of
having
often
related
something
untrue
which
he
has
perhaps
invented
finally
comes
to
believe
in
it
himself
and
as
one
often
represents
to
oneself
something
pleasing
one
makes
it
easy
to
imagine
and
one
thinks
it
also
easy
to
put
into
effect
whence
it
comes
that
one
persuades
oneself
easily
of
what
one
wishes
qui
amant
ipsi
sibi
somnia
errors
are
therefore
absolutely
speaking
never
voluntary
although
the
will
very
often
contributes
towards
them
indirectly
owing
to
the
pleasure
one
takes
in
giving
oneself
up
to
certain
thoughts
or
owing
to
the
aversion
one
feels
for
others
beautiful
print
in
a
book
will
help
towards
making
it
persuasive
to
the
reader
the
air
and
manner
of
a
speaker
will
win
the
audience
for
him
one
will
be
inclined
to
despise
doctrines
coming
from
a
man
one
despises
or
hates
or
from
another
who
resembles
him
in
some
point
that
strikes
us
i
have
already
said
why
one
is
readily
disposed
to
believe
what
is
advantageous
or
agreeable
and
i
have
known
people
who
at
first
had
changed
their
religion
for
worldly
considerations
but
who
have
been
persuaded
and
well
persuaded
afterwards
that
they
had
taken
the
right
course
one
sees
also
that
stubbornness
is
not
simply
wrong
choice
persevering
but
also
a
disposition
to
persevere
therein
which
is
due
to
some
good
supposed
to
be
inherent
in
the
choice
or
some
evil
imagined
as
arising
from
a
change
the
first
choice
has
perchance
been
made
in
mere
levity
but
the
intention
to
abide
by
it
springs
from
certain
stronger
reasons
or
impressions
there
are
even
some
writers
on
ethics
who
lay
it
down
that
one
ought
to
abide
by
one
choice
so
as
not
to
be
inconstant
or
appear
so
yet
perseverance
is
wrong
when
one
despises
the
warnings
of
reason
especially
when
the
subject
is
important
enough
to
be
examined
carefully
but
when
the
thought
of
change
is
unpleasant
one
readily
averts
one
attention
from
it
and
that
is
the
way
which
most
frequently
leads
one
to
stubbornness
the
author
wished
to
connect
stubbornness
with
his
pure
indifference
he
might
then
have
taken
into
account
that
to
make
us
cling
to
a
choice
there
would
be
need
of
more
than
the
mere
choice
itself
or
a
pure
indifference
especially
if
this
choice
has
been
made
lightly
and
all
the
more
lightly
in
proportion
to
the
indifference
shown
in
such
a
case
we
shall
be
readily
inclined
to
reverse
the
choice
unless
vanity
habit
interest
or
some
other
motive
makes
us
persevere
therein
it
must
not
be
supposed
either
that
vengeance
pleases
without
cause
persons
of
intense
feeling
ponder
upon
it
day
and
night
and
it
is
hard
for
them
to
efface
the
impression
of
the
wrong
or
the
affront
they
have
sustained
they
picture
for
themselves
a
very
great
pleasure
in
being
freed
from
the
thought
of
scorn
which
comes
upon
them
every
moment
and
which
causes
some
to
find
vengeance
sweeter
than
life
itself
vindicta
bonum
vita
jucundius
the
author
would
wish
to
persuade
us
that
usually
when
our
desire
or
our
aversion
is
for
some
object
which
does
not
sufficiently
deserve
it
we
have
given
to
it
the
surplus
of
good
or
evil
which
has
affected
us
through
the
alleged
power
of
choice
which
makes
things
appear
good
or
evil
as
we
wish
one
has
had
two
degrees
of
natural
evil
one
gives
oneself
six
degrees
of
artificial
good
through
the
power
that
can
choose
without
cause
thus
one
will
have
four
degrees
of
net
good
ch
sect
if
that
could
be
carried
out
it
would
take
us
far
as
i
have
already
said
here
the
author
even
thinks
that
ambition
avarice
the
gambling
mania
and
other
frivolous
passions
derive
all
their
force
from
this
power
ch
sect
but
there
are
besides
so
many
false
appearances
in
things
so
many
imaginations
capable
of
enlarging
or
diminishing
objects
so
many
unjustified
connexions
in
our
arguments
that
there
is
no
need
of
this
little
fairy
that
is
of
this
inward
power
operating
as
it
were
by
enchantment
to
whom
the
author
attributes
all
these
disorders
indeed
i
have
already
said
repeatedly
that
when
we
resolve
upon
some
course
contrary
to
acknowledged
reason
we
are
prompted
to
it
by
another
reason
stronger
to
outward
appearance
such
as
for
instance
is
the
pleasure
of
appearing
independent
and
of
performing
an
extraordinary
action
there
was
in
days
past
at
the
court
of
osnabrück
a
tutor
to
the
pages
who
like
a
second
mucius
scaevola
held
out
his
arm
into
the
flame
and
looked
like
getting
a
gangrene
in
order
to
show
that
the
strength
of
his
mind
was
greater
than
a
very
acute
pain
few
people
will
follow
his
example
and
i
do
not
even
know
if
a
writer
could
easily
be
found
who
having
once
affirmed
the
existence
of
a
power
capable
of
choosing
without
cause
or
even
contrary
to
reason
would
be
willing
to
prove
his
case
by
his
own
example
in
renouncing
some
good
benefice
or
some
high
office
simply
in
order
to
display
this
superiority
of
will
over
reason
but
i
am
sure
at
the
least
that
an
intelligent
man
would
not
do
so
he
would
be
presently
aware
that
someone
would
nullify
his
sacrifice
by
pointing
out
to
him
that
he
had
simply
imitated
heliodorus
bishop
of
larissa
that
man
so
it
is
said
held
his
book
on
theagenes
and
chariclea
dearer
than
his
bishopric
and
such
a
thing
may
easily
happen
when
a
man
has
resources
enabling
him
to
dispense
with
his
office
and
when
he
is
sensitive
to
reputation
thus
every
day
people
are
found
ready
to
sacrifice
their
advantages
to
their
caprices
that
is
to
say
actual
goods
to
the
mere
semblance
of
them
if
i
wished
to
follow
step
by
step
the
arguments
of
our
gifted
author
which
often
come
back
to
matters
previously
considered
in
our
inquiry
usually
however
with
some
elegant
and
addition
i
should
be
obliged
to
proceed
too
far
but
i
hope
that
i
shall
be
able
to
avoid
doing
so
having
as
i
think
sufficiently
met
all
his
reasons
the
best
thing
is
that
with
him
practice
usually
corrects
and
amends
theory
after
having
advanced
the
hypothesis
in
the
second
section
of
this
fifth
chapter
that
we
approach
god
through
the
capacity
to
choose
without
reason
and
that
this
power
being
of
the
noblest
kind
its
exercise
is
the
most
capable
of
making
one
happy
things
in
the
highest
degree
paradoxical
since
it
is
reason
which
leads
us
to
imitate
god
and
our
happiness
lies
in
following
reason
after
that
i
say
the
author
provides
an
excellent
corrective
for
he
says
rightly
that
in
order
to
be
happy
we
must
adapt
our
choice
to
things
since
things
are
scarcely
prone
to
adapt
themselves
to
us
and
that
this
is
in
effect
adapting
oneself
to
the
divine
will
doubtless
that
is
well
said
but
it
implies
besides
that
our
will
must
be
guided
as
far
as
possible
by
the
reality
of
the
objects
and
by
true
representations
of
good
and
evil
consequently
also
the
motives
of
good
and
evil
are
not
opposed
to
freedom
and
the
power
of
choosing
without
cause
far
from
ministering
to
our
happiness
will
be
useless
and
even
highly
prejudicial
thus
it
is
happily
the
case
that
this
power
nowhere
exists
and
that
it
is
being
of
reasoning
reason
as
some
schoolmen
call
the
fictions
that
are
not
even
possible
as
for
me
i
should
have
preferred
to
call
them
of
reason
also
i
think
that
the
third
section
on
wrong
elections
may
pass
since
it
says
that
one
must
not
choose
things
that
are
impossible
inconsistent
harmful
contrary
to
the
divine
will
or
already
taken
by
others
moreover
the
author
remarks
appositely
that
by
prejudicing
the
happiness
of
others
needlessly
one
offends
the
divine
will
which
desires
that
all
be
happy
as
far
as
it
is
possible
i
will
say
as
much
of
the
fourth
section
where
there
is
mention
of
the
source
of
wrong
elections
which
are
error
or
ignorance
negligence
fickleness
in
changing
too
readily
stubbornness
in
not
changing
in
time
and
bad
habits
finally
there
is
the
importunity
of
the
appetites
which
often
drive
us
inopportunely
towards
external
things
the
fifth
section
is
designed
to
reconcile
evil
elections
or
sins
with
the
power
and
goodness
of
god
and
this
section
as
it
is
diffuse
is
divided
into
the
author
has
cumbered
himself
needlessly
with
a
great
objection
for
he
asserts
that
without
a
power
to
choose
that
is
altogether
indifferent
in
the
choice
there
would
be
no
sin
now
it
was
very
easy
for
god
to
refuse
to
creatures
a
power
so
irrational
it
was
sufficient
for
them
to
be
actuated
by
the
representations
of
goods
and
evils
it
was
therefore
easy
according
to
the
author
hypothesis
for
god
to
prevent
sin
to
extricate
himself
from
this
difficulty
he
has
no
other
resource
than
to
state
that
if
this
power
were
removed
from
things
the
world
would
be
nothing
but
a
purely
passive
machine
but
that
is
the
very
thing
which
i
have
disproved
if
this
power
were
missing
in
the
world
as
in
fact
it
is
one
would
hardly
complain
of
the
fact
souls
will
be
well
content
with
the
representations
of
goods
and
evils
for
the
making
of
their
choice
and
the
world
will
remain
as
beautiful
as
it
is
the
author
comes
back
to
what
he
had
already
put
forward
here
that
without
this
power
there
would
be
no
happiness
but
i
have
given
a
sufficient
answer
to
that
and
there
is
not
the
slightest
probability
in
this
assertion
and
in
certain
other
paradoxes
he
puts
forward
here
to
support
his
principal
paradox
he
makes
a
small
digression
on
prayer
saying
that
those
who
pray
to
god
hope
for
some
change
in
the
order
of
nature
but
it
seems
as
though
according
to
his
opinion
they
are
mistaken
in
reality
men
will
be
content
if
their
prayers
are
heard
without
troubling
themselves
as
to
whether
the
course
of
nature
is
changed
in
their
favour
or
not
indeed
if
they
receive
succour
from
good
angels
there
will
be
no
change
in
the
general
order
of
things
also
this
opinion
of
our
author
is
a
very
reasonable
one
that
there
is
a
system
of
spiritual
substances
just
as
there
is
of
corporeal
substances
and
that
the
spiritual
have
communication
with
one
another
even
as
bodies
do
god
employs
the
ministry
of
angels
in
his
rule
of
mankind
without
any
detriment
to
the
order
of
nature
nevertheless
it
is
easier
to
put
forward
theories
on
these
matters
than
to
explain
them
unless
one
have
recourse
to
my
system
of
harmony
but
the
author
goes
somewhat
further
he
believes
that
the
mission
of
the
holy
spirit
was
a
great
miracle
in
the
beginning
but
that
now
his
operations
within
us
are
natural
i
leave
it
to
him
to
explain
his
opinion
and
to
settle
the
matter
with
other
theologians
yet
i
observe
that
he
finds
the
natural
efficacy
of
prayer
in
the
power
it
has
of
making
the
soul
better
of
overcoming
the
passions
and
of
winning
for
oneself
a
certain
degree
of
new
grace
i
can
say
almost
the
same
things
on
my
hypothesis
which
represents
the
will
as
acting
only
in
accordance
with
motives
and
i
am
immune
from
the
difficulties
in
which
the
author
has
become
involved
over
his
power
of
choosing
without
cause
he
is
in
great
embarrassment
also
with
regard
to
the
foreknowledge
of
god
for
if
the
soul
is
perfectly
indifferent
in
its
choice
how
is
it
possible
to
foresee
this
choice
and
what
sufficient
reason
will
one
be
able
to
find
for
the
knowledge
of
a
thing
if
there
is
no
reason
for
its
existence
the
author
puts
off
to
some
other
occasion
the
solution
of
this
difficulty
which
would
require
according
to
him
an
entire
work
for
the
rest
he
sometimes
speaks
pertinently
and
in
conformity
with
my
principles
on
the
subject
of
moral
evil
he
says
for
example
that
vices
and
crimes
do
not
detract
from
the
beauty
of
the
universe
but
rather
add
to
it
just
as
certain
dissonances
would
offend
the
ear
by
their
harshness
if
they
were
heard
quite
alone
and
yet
in
combination
they
render
the
harmony
more
pleasing
he
also
points
out
divers
goods
involved
in
evils
for
instance
the
usefulness
of
prodigality
in
the
rich
and
avarice
in
the
poor
indeed
it
serves
to
make
the
arts
flourish
we
must
also
bear
in
mind
that
we
are
not
to
judge
the
universe
by
the
small
size
of
our
globe
and
of
all
that
is
known
to
us
for
the
stains
and
defects
in
it
may
be
found
as
useful
for
enhancing
the
beauty
of
the
rest
as
patches
which
have
nothing
beautiful
in
themselves
are
by
the
fair
sex
found
adapted
to
embellish
the
whole
face
although
they
disfigure
the
part
they
cover
cotta
in
cicero
book
had
compared
providence
in
its
granting
of
reason
to
men
to
a
physician
who
allows
wine
to
a
patient
notwithstanding
that
he
foresees
the
misuse
which
will
be
made
thereof
by
the
patient
at
the
expense
of
his
life
the
author
replies
that
providence
does
what
wisdom
and
goodness
require
and
that
the
good
which
accrues
is
greater
than
the
evil
if
god
had
not
given
reason
to
man
there
would
have
been
no
man
at
all
and
god
would
be
like
a
physician
who
killed
someone
in
order
to
prevent
his
falling
one
may
add
that
it
is
not
reason
which
is
harmful
in
itself
but
the
absence
of
reason
and
when
reason
is
ill
employed
we
reason
well
about
means
but
not
adequately
about
an
end
or
about
that
bad
end
we
have
proposed
to
ourselves
thus
it
is
always
for
lack
of
reason
that
one
does
an
evil
deed
the
author
also
puts
forward
the
objection
made
by
epicurus
in
the
book
by
lactantius
on
the
wrath
of
god
the
terms
of
the
objection
are
more
or
less
as
follows
either
god
wishes
to
banish
evils
and
can
not
contrive
to
do
so
in
which
case
he
would
be
weak
or
he
can
abolish
them
and
will
not
which
would
be
a
sign
of
malignity
in
him
or
again
he
lacks
power
and
also
will
which
would
make
him
appear
both
weak
and
jealous
or
finally
he
can
and
will
but
in
this
case
it
will
be
asked
why
he
then
does
not
banish
evil
if
he
exists
the
author
replies
that
god
can
not
banish
evil
that
he
does
not
wish
to
either
and
that
notwithstanding
he
is
neither
malicious
nor
weak
i
should
have
preferred
to
say
that
he
can
banish
evil
but
that
he
does
not
wish
to
do
so
absolutely
and
rightly
so
because
he
would
then
banish
good
at
the
same
time
and
he
would
banish
more
good
than
evil
finally
our
author
having
finished
his
learned
work
adds
an
appendix
in
which
he
speaks
of
the
divine
laws
he
fittingly
divides
these
laws
into
natural
and
positive
he
observes
that
the
particular
laws
of
the
nature
of
animals
must
give
way
to
the
general
laws
of
bodies
that
god
is
not
in
reality
angered
when
his
laws
are
violated
but
that
order
demanded
that
he
who
sins
should
bring
an
evil
upon
himself
and
that
he
who
does
violence
to
others
should
suffer
violence
in
his
turn
but
he
believes
that
the
positive
laws
of
god
rather
indicate
and
forecast
the
evil
than
cause
its
infliction
and
that
gives
him
occasion
to
speak
of
the
eternal
damnation
of
the
wicked
which
no
longer
serves
either
for
correction
or
example
and
which
nevertheless
satisfies
the
retributive
justice
of
god
although
the
wicked
bring
their
unhappiness
upon
themselves
he
suspects
however
that
these
punishments
of
the
wicked
bring
some
advantage
to
virtuous
people
he
is
doubtful
also
whether
it
is
not
better
to
be
damned
than
to
be
nothing
for
it
might
be
that
the
damned
are
fools
capable
of
clinging
to
their
state
of
misery
owing
to
a
certain
perversity
of
mind
which
he
maintains
makes
them
congratulate
themselves
on
their
false
judgements
in
the
midst
of
their
misery
and
take
pleasure
in
finding
fault
with
the
will
of
god
for
every
day
one
sees
peevish
malicious
envious
people
who
enjoy
the
thought
of
their
ills
and
seek
to
bring
affliction
upon
themselves
these
ideas
are
not
worthy
of
contempt
and
i
have
sometimes
had
the
like
myself
but
i
am
far
from
passing
final
judgement
on
them
i
related
in
of
the
essays
written
to
oppose
bayle
the
fable
of
the
devil
refusal
of
the
pardon
a
hermit
offers
him
on
god
behalf
baron
andré
taifel
an
austrian
nobleman
knight
of
the
court
of
ferdinand
archduke
of
austria
who
became
the
second
emperor
of
that
name
alluding
to
his
name
which
appears
to
mean
devil
in
german
assumed
as
his
emblem
a
devil
or
satyr
with
this
spanish
motto
perdido
y
menos
the
more
lost
the
less
repentant
which
indicates
a
hopeless
passion
from
which
one
can
not
free
oneself
this
motto
was
afterwards
repeated
by
the
spanish
count
of
villamediana
when
he
was
said
to
be
in
love
with
the
queen
coming
to
the
question
why
evil
often
happens
to
the
good
and
good
to
the
wicked
our
illustrious
author
thinks
that
it
has
been
sufficiently
answered
and
that
hardly
any
doubt
remains
on
that
point
he
observes
nevertheless
that
one
may
often
doubt
whether
good
people
who
endure
affliction
have
not
been
made
good
by
their
very
misfortune
and
whether
the
fortunate
wicked
have
not
perhaps
been
spoilt
by
prosperity
he
adds
that
we
are
often
bad
judges
when
it
is
a
question
of
recognizing
not
only
a
virtuous
man
but
also
a
happy
man
one
often
honours
a
hypocrite
and
one
despises
another
whose
solid
virtue
is
without
pretence
we
are
poor
judges
of
happiness
also
and
often
felicity
is
hidden
from
sight
under
the
rags
of
a
contented
poor
man
while
it
is
sought
in
vain
in
the
palaces
of
certain
of
the
great
finally
the
author
observes
that
the
greatest
felicity
here
on
earth
lies
in
the
hope
of
future
happiness
and
thus
it
may
be
said
that
to
the
wicked
nothing
happens
save
what
is
of
service
for
correction
or
chastisement
and
to
the
good
nothing
save
what
ministers
to
their
greater
good
these
conclusions
entirely
correspond
to
my
opinion
and
one
can
say
nothing
more
appropriate
for
the
conclusion
of
this
work
causa
dei

the
