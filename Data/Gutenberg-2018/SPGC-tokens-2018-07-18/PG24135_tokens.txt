alfred
pendray
pushed
himself
along
the
corridor
of
the
battleship
holding
the
flashlight
in
one
hand
and
using
the
other
hand
and
his
good
leg
to
guide
and
propel
himself
by
the
beam
of
the
torch
reflected
queerly
from
the
pastel
green
walls
of
the
corridor
giving
him
the
uneasy
sensation
that
he
was
swimming
underwater
instead
of
moving
through
the
blasted
hulk
of
a
battleship
a
thousand
from
home
he
came
to
the
turn
in
the
corridor
and
tried
to
move
to
the
right
but
his
momentum
was
greater
than
he
had
thought
and
he
had
to
grab
the
corner
of
the
wall
to
keep
from
going
on
by
that
swung
him
around
and
his
sprained
ankle
slammed
agonizingly
against
the
other
side
of
the
passageway
pendray
clenched
his
teeth
and
kept
going
but
as
he
moved
down
the
side
passage
he
went
more
slowly
so
that
the
friction
of
his
palm
against
the
wall
could
be
used
as
a
brake
he
was
used
to
maneuvering
without
gravity
he
been
taught
it
in
cadets
of
course
but
that
was
years
ago
and
parsecs
away
when
the
pseudograv
generators
had
gone
out
he
retched
all
over
the
place
but
now
his
stomach
was
empty
and
the
nausea
had
gone
he
had
automatically
oriented
himself
in
the
corridors
so
that
the
doors
of
the
various
compartments
were
to
his
left
and
right
with
the
ceiling
above
and
the
deck
below
otherwise
he
might
have
lost
his
sense
of
direction
completely
in
the
complex
maze
of
the
interstellar
battleship
he
corrected
himself
left
of
a
and
what
left
just
al
pendray
and
less
than
half
of
the
the
door
to
the
lifeboat
hold
loomed
ahead
in
the
beam
of
the
flashlight
and
pendray
braked
himself
to
a
stop
he
just
looked
at
the
dogged
port
for
a
few
seconds
there
be
a
boat
in
he
thought
a
boat
that
all
i
ask
and
he
added
as
an
afterthought
then
his
hand
went
out
to
the
dog
handle
and
turned
the
door
cracked
easily
there
was
air
on
the
other
side
pendray
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
braced
his
good
foot
against
the
wall
and
pulled
the
door
open
the
little
lifeboat
was
there
nestled
tightly
in
her
cradle
for
the
first
time
since
the
had
been
hit
pendray
face
broke
into
a
broad
smile
the
fear
that
had
been
within
him
faded
a
little
and
the
darkness
of
the
crippled
ship
seemed
to
be
lessened
then
the
beam
of
his
torch
caught
the
little
red
tag
on
the
air
lock
of
the
lifeboat
work
under
way
do
not
remove
this
tag
without
proper
that
explained
why
the
lifeboat
had
been
used
by
the
other
crewmen
pendray
mind
was
numb
as
he
opened
the
air
lock
of
the
small
craft
he
did
even
attempt
to
think
all
he
wanted
was
to
see
exactly
how
the
vessel
had
been
disabled
by
the
repair
crew
he
went
inside
the
lights
were
working
in
the
lifeboat
that
showed
that
its
power
was
still
functioning
he
glanced
over
the
panels
no
red
tags
on
them
at
least
just
to
make
sure
he
opened
them
up
one
by
one
and
looked
inside
nothing
wrong
apparently
maybe
it
had
just
been
some
minor
repair
a
broken
lighting
switch
or
something
but
he
did
dare
hope
yet
he
went
through
the
door
in
the
tiny
cabin
that
led
to
the
engine
compartment
and
he
saw
what
the
trouble
was
the
shielding
had
been
removed
from
the
atomic
motors
he
just
hung
there
in
the
air
not
moving
his
lean
dark
face
remained
expressionless
but
tears
welled
up
in
his
eyes
and
spilled
over
spreading
their
dampness
over
his
lids
the
motors
would
run
all
right
the
ship
could
take
him
to
earth
but
the
radiation
leakage
from
those
motors
would
kill
him
long
before
he
made
it
home
it
would
take
ten
days
to
make
it
back
to
base
and
hours
of
exposure
to
the
deadly
radiation
from
those
engines
would
be
enough
to
insure
his
death
from
radiation
sickness
his
eyes
were
blurring
from
the
film
of
tears
that
covered
them
without
gravity
to
move
the
liquid
it
just
pooled
there
distorting
his
vision
he
blinked
the
tears
away
then
wiped
his
face
with
his
free
hand
now
what
he
was
the
only
man
left
alive
on
the
and
none
of
the
lifeboats
had
escaped
the
rat
cruisers
had
seen
to
that
they
were
really
rats
those
people
not
literally
they
looked
humanoid
enough
to
enable
plastic
surgeons
to
disguise
a
human
being
as
one
of
them
although
it
meant
sacrificing
the
little
fingers
and
little
toes
to
imitate
the
rats
the
rats
were
at
a
disadvantage
there
they
could
add
any
fingers
but
the
rats
had
other
advantages
they
bred
and
fought
like
well
like
rats
not
that
human
beings
could
equal
them
or
even
surpass
them
in
ferocity
if
necessary
but
the
rats
had
nearly
a
thousand
years
of
progress
over
earth
their
industrial
revolution
had
occurred
while
the
angles
and
the
saxons
and
the
jutes
were
pushing
the
britons
into
wales
they
had
put
their
first
artificial
satellites
into
orbit
while
king
alfred
the
great
was
fighting
off
the
danes
they
had
developed
as
rapidly
as
man
had
it
took
them
roughly
twice
as
long
to
go
from
one
step
to
the
next
so
that
their
actual
superiority
was
only
a
matter
of
five
hundred
years
and
man
was
catching
up
rapidly
unfortunately
man
had
caught
up
yet
the
first
meeting
of
the
two
races
had
taken
place
in
interstellar
space
and
had
seemed
friendly
enough
two
ships
had
come
within
detector
distance
of
each
other
and
had
circled
warily
it
was
almost
a
perfect
example
of
the
leinster
hypothesis
neither
knew
where
the
other
home
world
was
located
and
neither
could
go
back
home
for
fear
that
the
other
would
be
able
to
follow
but
the
leinster
hypothesis
could
be
followed
to
the
end
leinster
solution
had
been
to
have
the
parties
trade
ships
and
go
home
but
that
only
works
when
the
two
civilizations
are
fairly
close
in
technological
development
the
rats
certainly
were
going
to
trade
their
ship
for
the
inferior
craft
of
the
earthmen
the
rats
conscious
of
their
superiority
had
a
simpler
solution
they
were
certain
after
a
while
that
earth
posed
no
threat
to
them
so
they
invited
the
earth
ship
to
follow
them
home
the
earthmen
had
been
taken
on
a
carefully
conducted
tour
of
the
home
planet
and
the
captain
of
the
earth
ship
who
had
gone
down
in
history
as
sucker
johnston
was
convinced
that
the
rats
meant
no
harm
and
agreed
to
lead
a
rat
ship
back
to
earth
if
the
rats
had
struck
then
there
would
never
have
been
a
war
it
would
have
been
over
before
it
started
but
the
rats
were
too
proud
of
their
superiority
earth
was
too
far
away
to
bother
them
for
the
moment
it
was
in
their
line
of
conquest
just
yet
in
another
fifty
years
the
planet
would
be
ready
for
picking
off
earth
had
no
idea
that
the
rats
were
so
widespread
they
had
taken
and
colonized
over
thirty
planets
completely
destroying
the
indigenous
intelligent
races
that
had
existed
on
five
of
them
it
was
just
pride
that
had
made
the
rats
decide
to
wait
before
hitting
earth
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
prudence
too
none
of
the
other
races
they
had
met
had
developed
space
travel
the
earthmen
might
be
a
little
tougher
to
beat
not
that
there
was
any
doubt
of
the
outcome
as
far
as
they
were
concerned
but
why
take
chances
but
while
the
rats
had
fooled
sucker
johnston
and
some
of
his
officers
the
majority
of
the
crew
knew
better
rat
crewmen
were
little
short
of
slaves
and
the
rats
made
the
mistake
of
assuming
that
the
earth
crewmen
were
the
same
they
had
tried
to
impress
the
crewmen
as
they
had
the
officers
when
the
interrogation
officers
on
earth
questioned
the
crew
of
the
earth
ship
they
too
became
suspicious
johnston
optimistic
attitude
just
did
jibe
with
the
facts
so
while
the
rat
officers
were
having
the
red
carpet
rolled
out
for
them
earth
intelligence
went
to
work
several
presumably
men
were
allowed
to
take
a
conducted
tour
of
the
rat
ship
after
all
why
not
the
twentieth
century
russians
probably
would
have
minded
showing
their
rocket
plants
to
an
american
of
captain
john
smith
time
either
but
there
a
difference
earth
government
knew
earth
was
being
threatened
and
they
knew
they
had
to
get
as
many
facts
as
they
could
they
were
also
aware
of
the
fact
that
if
you
know
a
thing
be
done
then
you
will
eventually
find
a
way
to
do
it
during
the
next
fifty
years
earth
learned
more
than
it
had
during
the
previous
hundred
the
race
expanded
secretly
moving
out
to
other
planets
in
that
sector
of
the
galaxy
and
they
worked
to
catch
up
with
the
rats
they
did
make
it
of
course
when
after
fifty
years
of
presumably
peaceful
but
highly
limited
contact
the
rats
hit
earth
they
found
out
one
thing
that
the
mass
and
energy
of
a
planet
armed
with
the
proper
weapons
can
not
be
by
any
conceivable
concentration
of
spaceships
throwing
rocks
at
an
army
armed
with
machine
guns
may
seem
futile
but
if
you
hit
them
with
an
avalanche
they
go
under
the
rats
lost
of
their
fleet
to
guns
and
had
to
go
home
to
bandage
their
wounds
the
only
trouble
was
that
earth
could
counterattack
their
ships
were
still
by
those
of
the
rats
and
the
rats
their
racial
pride
badly
stung
were
determined
to
wipe
out
man
to
erase
the
stain
on
their
honor
wherever
man
could
be
found
somehow
some
way
they
must
destroy
earth
and
now
al
pendray
thought
bitterly
they
would
do
it
the
had
sneaked
in
past
rat
patrols
to
pick
up
a
spy
on
one
of
the
outlying
rat
planets
a
man
who
spent
five
years
playing
the
part
of
a
rat
slave
trying
to
get
information
on
their
activities
there
and
he
had
had
one
vital
bit
of
knowledge
he
found
it
and
held
on
to
it
for
over
three
years
until
the
time
came
for
the
rendezvous
the
rendezvous
had
almost
come
too
late
the
rats
had
developed
a
device
that
could
make
a
star
temporarily
unstable
and
they
were
ready
to
use
it
on
sol
the
had
managed
to
get
with
the
spy
but
they
been
spotted
in
spite
of
the
detector
nullifiers
that
earth
had
developed
they
been
jumped
by
rat
cruisers
and
blasted
by
the
superior
rat
weapons
the
lifeboats
had
been
picked
out
of
space
one
by
one
as
the
crew
tried
to
get
away
in
a
way
alfred
pendray
was
lucky
he
been
in
the
sick
bay
with
a
sprained
ankle
when
the
rats
hit
sitting
in
the
room
the
shot
that
had
knocked
out
the
port
engine
had
knocked
him
unconscious
but
the
shielded
walls
of
the
room
had
saved
him
from
the
blast
of
radiation
that
had
cut
down
the
crew
in
the
rear
of
the
ship
he
come
to
in
time
to
see
the
rat
cruisers
cut
up
the
lifeboats
before
they
could
get
well
away
from
the
ship
they
taken
a
couple
of
parting
shots
at
the
dead
hulk
and
then
left
it
to
drift
in
space
and
leaving
one
man
alive
in
the
small
section
near
the
rear
of
the
ship
there
were
still
compartments
that
were
airtight
at
least
pendray
decided
there
was
enough
air
to
keep
him
alive
for
a
while
if
only
he
could
get
a
little
power
into
the
ship
he
could
get
the
rear
air
purifiers
to
working
he
left
the
lifeboat
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
there
was
no
point
in
worrying
about
a
boat
he
could
use
he
made
his
way
back
toward
the
engine
room
maybe
there
was
something
salvageable
there
swimming
through
the
corridors
was
becoming
easier
with
practice
his
cadet
training
was
coming
back
to
him
then
he
got
a
shock
that
almost
made
him
faint
the
beam
of
his
light
had
fallen
full
on
the
face
of
a
rat
it
took
him
several
seconds
to
realize
that
the
rat
was
dead
and
several
more
to
realize
that
it
was
a
rat
at
all
it
was
the
spy
they
had
been
sent
to
pick
up
been
in
the
sick
bay
for
treatments
of
the
ulcers
on
his
back
gained
from
five
years
of
frequent
lashings
as
a
rat
slave
pendray
went
closer
and
looked
him
over
he
was
still
wearing
the
clothing
he
had
on
when
the
picked
him
up
pendray
thought
that
hell
for
then
he
went
around
the
corpse
and
continued
toward
the
engine
room
the
place
was
still
hot
but
it
was
thermal
heat
not
radioactivity
a
dead
atomic
engine
does
leave
any
residual
effects
five
out
of
the
six
engines
were
utterly
ruined
but
the
sixth
seemed
to
be
in
working
condition
even
the
shielding
was
intact
again
hope
rose
in
alfred
pendray
mind
if
only
there
were
tools
a
half
hour
search
killed
that
idea
there
were
no
tools
aboard
capable
of
cutting
through
the
hard
shielding
he
could
use
it
to
shield
the
engine
on
the
lifeboat
and
the
shielding
that
been
on
the
other
five
engines
had
melted
and
run
it
was
worthless
then
another
idea
hit
him
would
the
remaining
engine
work
at
all
could
it
be
fixed
it
was
the
only
hope
he
had
left
apparently
the
only
thing
wrong
with
it
was
the
exciter
circuit
leads
which
had
been
sheared
off
by
a
bit
of
flying
metal
the
engine
had
simply
stopped
instead
of
exploding
that
ought
to
be
fixable
he
could
try
it
was
something
to
do
anyway
it
took
him
the
better
part
of
two
days
according
to
his
watch
there
were
plenty
of
smaller
tools
around
for
the
job
although
many
of
them
were
scattered
and
some
had
been
ruined
by
the
explosions
replacement
parts
were
harder
to
find
but
he
managed
to
pirate
some
of
them
from
the
ruined
engines
he
ate
and
slept
as
he
felt
the
need
there
was
plenty
of
food
in
the
sick
bay
kitchen
and
there
is
no
need
for
a
bed
under
conditions
after
the
engine
was
repaired
he
set
about
getting
the
rest
of
the
ship
ready
to
move
if
it
move
the
hull
was
still
solid
so
the
infraspace
field
should
function
the
air
purifiers
had
to
be
reconnected
and
repaired
in
a
couple
of
places
the
lights
ditto
the
biggest
job
was
checking
all
the
broken
leads
to
make
sure
there
any
short
circuits
anywhere
the
pseudogravity
circuits
were
hopeless
he
have
to
do
without
gravity
on
the
third
day
he
decided
he
better
clean
the
place
up
there
were
several
corpses
floating
around
and
they
were
beginning
to
be
noticeable
he
had
to
tow
them
one
by
one
to
the
rear
starboard
air
lock
and
seal
them
between
the
inner
and
outer
doors
he
could
dump
them
since
the
outer
door
was
partially
melted
and
welded
shut
he
took
the
personal
effects
from
the
men
if
he
ever
got
back
to
earth
their
might
want
the
stuff
on
the
body
of
the
imitation
rat
he
found
a
full
of
microfilm
the
report
on
the
new
weapon
possibly
he
have
to
look
it
over
later
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
he
started
the
single
remaining
engine
the
infraspace
field
came
on
and
the
ship
began
moving
at
multiples
of
the
speed
of
light
pendray
grinned
gone
will
he
thought
gleefully
if
pendray
had
had
any
liquor
aboard
he
would
have
gotten
mildly
drunk
instead
he
sat
down
and
read
the
spools
of
microfilm
using
the
projector
in
the
sick
bay
he
was
not
a
scientist
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word
he
was
a
navigator
and
a
fairly
good
engineer
so
it
did
surprise
him
any
that
he
could
understand
a
lot
of
the
report
the
mechanics
of
making
a
out
of
a
normal
star
were
more
than
a
little
bit
over
his
head
he
read
a
little
and
then
go
out
and
take
a
look
at
the
stars
checking
their
movement
so
that
he
could
make
an
estimate
of
his
speed
he
a
kind
of
control
on
the
hull
field
so
he
could
aim
the
hulk
easily
enough
he
only
have
to
get
within
signaling
range
anyway
an
earth
ship
would
pick
him
up
there
was
any
earth
left
by
the
time
he
got
he
forced
his
mind
away
from
thinking
about
that
it
was
not
until
he
reached
the
last
spool
of
microfilm
that
his
situation
was
forcibly
brought
to
focus
in
his
mind
thus
far
he
had
thought
only
about
saving
himself
but
the
note
at
the
end
of
the
spool
made
him
realize
that
there
were
others
to
save
the
note
said
reports
must
reach
earth
before
june
after
that
it
will
be
too
june
that
was
let
see
is
the
eighteenth
of
he
thought
of
next
year
is
nine
months
away
surely
i
can
make
it
in
that
time
i
got
the
only
question
was
how
fast
was
the
hulk
of
the
moving
it
took
him
three
days
to
get
the
answer
accurately
he
knew
the
strength
of
the
field
around
the
ship
and
he
knew
the
approximate
thrust
of
the
single
engine
by
that
time
he
had
also
measured
the
motions
of
some
of
the
nearer
stars
thank
heaven
he
was
a
navigator
and
not
a
mechanic
or
something
at
least
he
knew
the
direction
and
distance
to
earth
and
he
knew
the
distance
of
the
brighter
stars
from
where
the
ship
was
he
had
two
checks
to
use
then
star
motion
against
engine
thrust
and
field
strength
he
checked
them
and
rechecked
them
and
hated
the
answer
he
would
arrive
in
the
vicinity
of
sol
some
time
in
late
july
a
full
month
too
late
what
could
he
do
increase
the
output
of
the
engine
no
it
was
doing
the
best
it
could
now
even
shutting
off
the
lights
would
help
anything
they
were
a
microscopic
drain
on
that
engine
he
tried
to
think
tried
to
reason
out
a
solution
but
nothing
would
come
he
found
time
to
curse
the
fool
who
had
decided
the
shielding
on
the
lifeboat
would
have
to
be
removed
and
repaired
that
little
craft
with
its
lighter
mass
and
more
powerful
field
concentration
could
make
the
trip
in
ten
days
the
only
trouble
was
that
ten
days
in
that
radiation
hell
would
be
impossible
he
be
a
very
corpse
in
half
that
time
and
there
be
no
one
aboard
to
guide
her
maybe
he
could
get
one
of
the
other
engines
going
sure
he
be
able
to
get
one
more
going
somehow
anything
to
cut
down
on
that
time
he
went
back
to
the
engines
again
looking
them
over
carefully
he
went
over
them
again
not
a
single
one
could
be
repaired
at
all
then
he
rechecked
his
velocity
figures
hoping
against
hope
that
made
a
mistake
somewhere
dropped
a
decimal
point
or
forgotten
to
divide
by
two
anything
anything
but
there
was
nothing
his
figures
had
been
accurate
the
first
time
for
a
while
he
just
gave
up
all
he
could
think
of
was
the
terrible
blaze
of
heat
that
would
wipe
out
earth
when
the
rats
set
off
the
sun
man
might
survive
there
were
colonies
that
the
rats
did
know
about
but
they
find
them
eventually
without
earth
the
race
would
be
set
back
five
hundred
maybe
five
thousand
years
the
rats
would
would
have
plenty
of
time
to
hunt
them
out
and
destroy
them
and
then
he
forced
his
mind
away
from
that
train
of
thought
there
had
to
be
a
way
to
get
there
on
time
something
in
the
back
of
his
mind
told
him
that
there
a
way
he
had
to
think
really
think
on
june
a
signal
officer
on
the
earth
destroyer
picked
up
a
faint
signal
coming
from
the
general
direction
of
the
constellation
of
sagittarius
it
was
the
standard
emergency
signal
for
distress
the
broadcaster
only
had
a
very
short
range
so
the
source
could
be
too
far
away
he
made
his
report
to
the
ship
captain
we
within
easy
range
of
her
sir
he
finished
shall
we
pick
her
up
might
be
a
rat
trick
said
the
captain
but
we
have
to
take
the
chance
beam
a
call
to
earth
and
let
go
out
there
dead
slow
if
the
detectors
show
anything
funny
we
turn
tail
and
run
we
in
no
position
to
fight
a
rat
ship
you
think
this
might
be
a
rat
trap
sir
the
captain
grinned
if
you
are
referring
to
the
as
a
rat
trap
blake
you
both
disrespectful
and
correct
that
why
going
to
run
if
we
see
anything
funny
this
ship
is
already
obsolete
by
our
standards
you
can
imagine
what
it
is
by
theirs
he
paused
get
that
call
in
to
earth
tell
this
ship
is
using
a
distress
signal
that
was
obsolete
six
months
ago
and
tell
we
going
out
yes
sir
said
the
signal
officer
it
was
a
trap
as
the
approached
the
source
of
the
signal
their
detectors
picked
up
the
ship
itself
it
was
a
standard
lifeboat
from
a
battleship
of
the
class
you
do
suppose
that
from
the
do
you
the
captain
said
softly
as
he
looked
at
the
plate
she
the
only
ship
of
that
class
that
missing
but
if
that
a
lifeboat
what
took
her
so
long
to
get
here
she
cut
her
engines
sir
said
the
observer
she
evidently
knows
we
coming
all
right
pull
her
in
as
soon
as
we
close
enough
put
her
in
number
two
lifeboat
rack
it
empty
when
the
door
of
the
lifeboat
opened
the
captain
of
the
was
waiting
outside
the
lifeboat
rack
he
did
know
exactly
what
he
had
expected
to
see
but
it
somehow
seemed
fitting
that
a
lean
bearded
man
in
a
badly
worn
uniform
and
a
haggard
look
about
him
should
step
out
the
specter
saluted
lieutenant
alfred
pendray
of
the
he
said
in
a
voice
that
had
almost
no
strength
he
held
up
a
pouch
microfilm
he
said
must
get
to
earth
immediately
no
delay
hurry
catch
him
the
captain
shouted
he
falling
but
one
of
the
men
nearby
had
already
caught
him
in
the
sick
bay
pendray
came
to
again
the
captain
questioning
gradually
got
the
story
out
of
pendray
so
i
did
know
what
to
do
then
he
said
his
voice
a
breathy
whisper
i
knew
i
had
to
get
that
stuff
home
somehow
go
on
said
the
captain
frowning
simple
matter
said
pendray
nothing
to
it
two
equations
little
ship
goes
thirty
times
as
fast
as
big
ship
big
had
to
get
here
before
june
to
only
way
out
anyway
two
equations
simple
work
in
your
head
big
ship
takes
ten
months
little
one
takes
ten
days
but
ca
stay
in
a
little
ship
ten
days
no
shielding
be
dead
before
you
got
here
see
i
see
said
the
captain
patiently
and
here
a
point
if
you
stay
on
the
big
ship
for
eight
an
a
half
months
then
y
only
got
to
be
in
the
little
ship
for
a
day
an
a
half
to
get
here
man
can
live
that
long
even
under
that
radiation
see
and
with
that
he
closed
his
eyes
do
you
mean
you
exposed
yourself
to
the
full
leakage
radiation
from
a
lifeboat
engine
for
hours
but
there
was
no
answer
let
him
sleep
said
the
ship
doctor
if
he
wakes
up
again
i
let
you
know
but
he
might
not
be
very
lucid
from
here
on
in
is
there
anything
you
can
do
the
captain
asked
no
not
after
a
radiation
dosage
like
that
he
looked
down
at
pendray
his
problem
was
easy
mathematically
but
not
psychologically
that
took
real
guts
to
solve
yeah
said
the
captain
gently
all
he
had
to
do
was
here
alive
the
problem
said
nothing
about
his
staying
that
way
