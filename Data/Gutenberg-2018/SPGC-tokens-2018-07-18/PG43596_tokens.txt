adventures
of
sammy
jay
makes
a
sammy
jay
doesn
t
mind
the
cold
of
winter
indeed
he
rather
likes
it
under
his
handsome
coat
of
blue
trimmed
with
white
he
wears
a
warm
silky
suit
of
underwear
and
he
laughs
at
rough
brother
north
wind
and
his
cousin
jack
frost
but
still
he
doesn
t
like
the
winter
as
well
as
he
does
the
warmer
seasons
because
he
is
a
lazy
fellow
and
doesn
t
like
to
work
for
a
living
any
harder
than
he
has
to
and
in
the
winter
it
isn
t
so
easy
to
get
something
to
eat
and
there
is
another
reason
why
sammy
jay
doesn
t
like
the
winter
as
well
as
the
other
seasons
what
do
you
think
it
is
it
isn
t
a
nice
reason
at
all
no
sir
it
isn
t
a
nice
reason
at
all
it
is
because
it
isn
t
so
easy
to
stir
up
trouble
somehow
sammy
jay
never
seems
really
happy
unless
he
is
stirring
up
trouble
for
some
one
else
he
just
delights
in
tormenting
other
little
people
of
the
green
meadows
and
the
green
forest
dear
dear
it
is
a
dreadful
thing
to
say
but
sammy
jay
is
bold
and
bad
he
steals
yes
sir
sammy
jay
steals
whenever
he
gets
a
chance
he
had
rather
steal
a
breakfast
any
time
than
get
it
honestly
now
people
who
steal
usually
are
very
sly
sammy
jay
is
sly
indeed
he
is
one
of
the
slyest
of
all
the
little
people
who
live
in
the
green
forest
instead
of
spending
his
time
honestly
hunting
for
his
meals
he
spends
most
of
it
watching
his
neighbors
to
find
out
where
they
have
their
so
that
he
can
help
himself
when
their
backs
are
turned
he
slips
through
the
green
forest
as
still
as
still
can
be
hiding
in
the
thick
and
behind
the
trunks
of
big
trees
and
peering
out
with
those
sharp
eyes
of
his
at
his
neighbors
whenever
he
is
discovered
he
always
pretends
to
be
very
busy
about
his
own
business
and
very
much
surprised
to
find
any
one
is
near
it
was
in
this
way
that
he
had
discovered
one
of
the
of
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
he
didn
t
let
chatterer
know
that
he
had
discovered
it
oh
my
no
he
didn
t
even
go
near
it
again
for
a
long
time
but
he
didn
t
forget
it
sammy
jay
never
forgets
things
of
that
kind
never
he
thought
of
it
often
and
often
when
he
did
he
would
say
to
himself
sometime
when
the
snow
is
deep
and
chatterer
is
fast
asleep
when
mother
nature
is
unkind
and
things
to
eat
are
hard
to
find
i
ll
help
myself
and
fly
away
to
steal
again
some
other
day
the
snow
was
deep
now
and
things
to
eat
were
hard
to
find
but
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
wasn
t
asleep
no
indeed
chatterer
seemed
to
like
the
cold
weather
and
was
as
frisky
and
spry
as
ever
he
is
and
he
never
went
very
far
away
from
that
sammy
jay
watched
and
watched
but
never
once
did
he
get
a
chance
to
steal
the
sweet
acorns
that
he
had
seen
chatterer
store
away
in
the
fall
said
sammy
jay
to
himself
i
must
do
something
to
get
chatterer
away
from
his
for
a
long
time
sammy
jay
sat
in
the
top
of
a
tall
dark
thinking
and
thinking
then
his
sharp
eyes
twinkled
with
a
look
of
great
cunning
and
he
chuckled
it
was
a
naughty
chuckle
away
he
flew
to
a
very
thick
some
distance
away
in
the
green
forest
but
where
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
could
hear
him
there
sammy
jay
began
to
make
a
great
fuss
he
screamed
and
screeched
as
only
he
can
pretty
soon
just
as
he
expected
he
saw
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
hurrying
over
to
see
what
the
fuss
was
all
about
sammy
jay
slipped
out
of
the
other
side
of
the
and
without
a
sound
hurried
over
to
chatterer
s
bitter
as
he
flew
through
the
green
forest
sammy
jay
chuckled
and
chuckled
to
himself
it
wasn
t
a
good
chuckle
to
hear
it
was
the
kind
of
chuckle
that
only
folks
who
are
doing
wrong
and
think
they
are
smart
because
they
are
doing
wrong
use
sammy
jay
thought
that
he
was
smart
very
smart
indeed
he
had
screamed
and
shrieked
and
made
a
great
fuss
over
nothing
at
all
until
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
had
come
hurrying
over
to
find
out
what
it
all
meant
then
sammy
jay
had
slipped
away
unseen
and
come
straight
to
the
of
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
this
particular
had
once
been
the
home
of
blacky
the
crow
when
blacky
deserted
it
for
a
new
home
chatterer
had
taken
it
for
a
he
had
roofed
it
over
and
all
through
the
pleasant
fall
he
had
stored
away
nuts
and
acorns
in
it
sammy
jay
had
watched
him
he
had
seen
those
sweet
acorns
and
nuts
put
there
and
he
had
never
forgotten
them
now
with
the
snow
deep
on
the
ground
the
easiest
way
to
get
a
good
meal
that
he
knew
of
was
to
steal
some
of
those
very
acorns
so
he
chuckled
as
he
pulled
apart
the
roof
of
chatterer
s
in
search
of
those
acorns
now
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
is
quite
as
smart
as
sammy
jay
indeed
he
is
very
much
like
sammy
jay
for
he
is
a
and
a
thief
himself
so
because
people
who
do
wrong
always
are
on
the
watch
for
others
to
do
wrong
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
had
kept
his
sharp
eyes
wide
open
all
the
time
he
had
been
filling
his
in
the
fall
and
he
had
spied
sammy
jay
s
smart
blue
coat
when
sammy
had
thought
himself
nicely
hidden
chatterer
had
known
what
sammy
jay
was
hiding
there
for
his
sharp
eyes
snapped
but
he
went
right
on
filling
his
just
the
same
then
just
as
soon
as
he
was
sure
that
sammy
jay
had
gone
away
chatterer
had
taken
out
every
one
of
the
sweet
acorns
and
put
them
in
another
inside
a
hollow
tree
he
had
left
nothing
but
hickory
nuts
for
he
knew
that
these
are
too
hard
for
sammy
jay
to
crack
but
sammy
jay
didn
t
know
anything
about
this
and
so
now
as
he
broke
his
way
into
the
he
chuckled
greedily
pretty
soon
he
had
a
hole
big
enough
to
stick
his
head
in
and
his
mouth
watered
as
he
reached
in
for
a
sweet
acorn
all
he
could
find
were
hard
hickory
nuts
what
did
it
mean
in
a
great
rage
sammy
jay
began
to
tear
the
to
pieces
there
must
be
some
sweet
acorns
there
somewhere
hadn
t
he
seen
chatterer
put
them
there
he
forgot
that
he
was
stealing
he
forgot
everything
except
his
disappointment
and
the
more
he
thought
of
this
the
angrier
he
grew
he
would
have
pulled
the
all
to
pieces
if
chatterer
himself
hadn
t
come
home
sammy
jay
had
just
stopped
for
breath
when
he
heard
the
rattle
of
claws
on
the
bark
of
the
tree
he
knew
what
that
meant
and
he
didn
t
wait
to
look
down
he
just
spread
his
blue
wings
and
with
a
scream
of
rage
flew
over
to
the
next
tree
then
such
a
dreadful
noise
as
there
was
in
the
green
forest
robber
screamed
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
dancing
up
and
down
with
anger
thief
yourself
screamed
sammy
jay
it
was
a
dreadful
quarrel
and
all
the
little
forest
people
who
were
within
hearing
stopped
their
ears
vanity
of
sammy
when
sammy
jay
isn
t
planning
mischief
or
sticking
his
bill
into
the
affairs
of
other
folks
with
which
he
has
no
concern
or
trying
to
frighten
some
one
bigger
than
himself
or
scare
some
one
smaller
than
himself
he
spends
a
great
deal
of
his
time
admiring
his
fine
clothes
and
thinking
what
a
handsome
fellow
he
is
and
he
is
a
handsome
fellow
even
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
who
is
always
quarreling
with
him
admits
that
sammy
jay
is
a
handsome
fellow
he
carries
himself
proudly
when
he
thinks
any
one
is
looking
his
shape
is
very
trim
and
neat
and
he
is
a
very
smart
looking
fellow
indeed
and
his
coat
was
there
ever
such
a
coat
before
it
seems
as
if
old
mother
nature
must
have
cut
off
a
little
piece
of
the
sky
when
it
was
bluest
on
a
summer
day
to
make
sammy
jay
s
coat
and
that
she
must
have
taken
a
tiny
strip
from
the
whitest
cloud
to
trim
it
with
and
then
she
gave
him
a
smart
cap
and
a
black
collar
and
a
waistcoat
of
just
the
softest
that
shows
off
his
blue
coat
best
old
mother
nature
certainly
was
feeling
very
good
indeed
when
she
planned
sammy
jay
s
clothes
now
sammy
jay
knows
just
how
handsome
he
is
if
you
should
ask
him
and
he
would
condescend
to
talk
to
you
at
all
which
he
probably
wouldn
t
do
he
would
tell
you
that
he
is
the
handsomest
fellow
in
the
world
of
course
this
isn
t
true
but
sammy
jay
thinks
it
is
and
so
sammy
jay
is
very
fond
of
showing
off
his
fine
clothes
and
making
fun
of
other
people
who
are
not
so
finely
dressed
he
spends
a
great
deal
of
time
in
caring
for
his
beautiful
coat
and
in
admiring
himself
whenever
he
can
see
his
reflection
in
a
little
pool
of
water
now
peter
rabbit
isn
t
the
least
bit
like
sammy
jay
he
doesn
t
think
about
his
clothes
at
all
indeed
peter
thinks
so
little
about
his
clothes
that
it
doesn
t
trouble
him
a
bit
to
wear
a
white
patch
on
the
seat
of
his
trousers
and
peter
dearly
loves
to
make
fun
of
sammy
jay
so
it
tickled
peter
immensely
one
day
to
find
sammy
jay
admiring
himself
peter
had
come
up
through
the
green
forest
without
making
a
sound
for
with
the
snow
covering
the
ground
there
were
no
dead
leaves
to
rustle
as
usual
his
long
ears
were
cocked
up
to
catch
every
sound
suddenly
peter
stopped
he
had
heard
sammy
jay
s
voice
and
by
the
sound
peter
knew
that
sammy
was
talking
to
himself
very
very
softly
peter
stole
forward
and
hid
where
he
could
see
sammy
jay
in
a
big
i
ve
got
the
handsomest
coat
in
all
the
green
forest
said
sammy
jay
stretching
one
of
his
wings
out
and
cocking
his
head
on
one
side
to
admire
it
and
where
else
is
such
a
beautiful
tail
to
be
found
he
spread
his
tail
so
that
a
ray
of
sunshine
would
fall
on
it
it
certainly
was
very
beautiful
as
blue
as
the
sky
with
a
little
band
of
white
across
the
tip
and
little
bars
of
black
across
the
outer
sides
even
peter
rabbit
with
his
nose
turned
up
in
scorn
had
to
admit
to
himself
that
it
certainly
was
a
handsome
tail
i
m
so
glad
it
s
mine
sighed
sammy
jay
it
must
be
dreadful
not
to
be
handsome
peter
rabbit
could
keep
still
no
longer
it
s
a
good
thing
you
admire
yourself
sammy
jay
because
no
one
else
does
he
shouted
handsome
is
as
it
may
do
don
t
forget
that
sammy
jay
underneath
that
coat
of
blue
is
a
black
heart
sammy
jay
everybody
near
and
far
knows
you
for
just
what
you
of
all
chief
handsome
clothes
won
t
hide
a
thief
sammy
jay
flew
into
a
rage
but
when
he
opened
his
mouth
to
call
peter
names
all
he
could
say
was
thief
thief
thief
what
did
i
tell
you
said
peter
rabbit
grinning
jay
gets
even
with
peter
i
ll
get
even
with
you
peter
rabbit
i
ll
get
even
with
you
sammy
jay
fairly
hopped
up
and
down
on
the
branch
of
the
big
pine
he
was
so
angry
peter
just
thrust
his
tongue
into
one
cheek
in
the
sauciest
way
and
then
laughed
at
sammy
jay
of
course
it
is
true
as
every
one
in
the
green
forest
and
on
the
green
meadows
knows
that
sammy
jay
is
a
thief
but
no
one
likes
to
be
told
that
he
is
a
thief
even
if
he
is
sammy
jay
least
of
all
like
a
great
many
other
people
who
do
wrong
sammy
jay
likes
to
pretend
that
he
is
a
very
fine
gentleman
and
he
wants
other
people
to
think
so
too
so
he
takes
great
care
of
his
handsome
blue
coat
and
struts
around
a
great
deal
when
he
thinks
other
folks
are
looking
at
him
illustration
i
ll
get
even
with
you
peter
rabbit
missing
from
book
so
sammy
jay
studied
and
studied
how
he
could
get
even
with
peter
rabbit
he
called
peter
names
whenever
he
saw
him
but
peter
didn
t
mind
that
in
the
least
for
he
could
call
names
back
again
besides
names
never
hurt
and
it
is
very
foolish
to
call
them
so
sammy
jay
studied
and
studied
how
he
could
get
even
with
peter
rabbit
in
some
other
way
then
one
day
as
he
sat
in
the
big
studying
sammy
heard
a
voice
that
gave
him
an
idea
it
was
the
voice
of
redtail
the
hawk
who
you
know
is
own
cousin
to
old
whitetail
and
to
roughleg
now
sammy
jay
can
scream
so
exactly
like
redtail
the
hawk
that
you
can
not
tell
their
voices
apart
when
he
heard
that
scream
sammy
jay
chuckled
out
loud
he
had
thought
of
a
plan
to
get
even
with
peter
rabbit
every
day
after
that
sammy
jay
went
peeking
and
prying
through
the
green
forest
and
around
the
edge
of
the
green
meadows
without
making
a
sound
just
watching
for
peter
rabbit
the
snow
was
almost
all
gone
and
that
is
how
it
happened
that
redtail
had
come
back
from
the
south
where
he
had
spent
the
winter
sammy
jay
felt
quite
sure
that
peter
didn
t
know
that
redtail
was
back
yet
he
hoped
he
didn
t
anyway
early
one
morning
sammy
jay
sat
hidden
on
the
edge
of
the
green
forest
watching
the
old
where
peter
rabbit
lives
he
saw
peter
come
out
of
one
of
his
private
little
paths
and
sit
up
very
straight
for
a
long
time
peter
sat
looking
this
way
and
looking
that
way
over
the
green
meadows
when
he
was
sure
that
reddy
and
granny
fox
were
nowhere
about
and
that
roughleg
was
nowhere
in
sight
peter
kicked
up
his
heels
and
scampered
out
on
to
the
green
meadows
away
from
the
dear
old
to
see
if
there
were
any
signs
of
spring
sammy
waited
until
peter
had
reached
the
big
over
by
the
smiling
pool
then
very
silently
he
flew
over
to
the
big
peter
was
so
busy
looking
for
jerry
muskrat
that
he
didn
t
see
sammy
jay
at
all
suddenly
right
over
peter
s
head
sounded
a
fierce
shrill
scream
peter
knew
that
voice
at
least
he
thought
he
did
he
didn
t
stop
to
look
he
had
learned
long
ago
that
it
is
best
to
run
first
and
look
afterward
so
now
he
started
for
the
dear
old
as
fast
as
his
long
legs
would
take
him
his
heart
in
his
mouth
again
that
fierce
scream
sounded
right
over
him
peter
ran
faster
than
ever
and
as
he
ran
he
dodged
this
way
and
dodged
that
way
every
second
he
expected
to
feel
the
sharp
claws
of
redtail
the
hawk
my
such
jumps
as
peter
did
take
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
never
would
reach
the
dear
old
but
he
did
and
just
as
soon
as
he
was
safely
inside
he
turned
around
to
see
what
had
become
of
redtail
and
what
do
you
think
he
saw
why
only
sammy
jay
laughing
fit
to
kill
himself
fraidcat
fraidcat
shouted
sammy
jay
peter
shook
his
fist
then
he
grinned
foolishly
i
guess
you
are
even
sammy
jay
he
said
jay
brings
peter
rabbit
had
a
very
funny
feeling
he
had
started
out
that
morning
with
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
he
had
meant
to
go
straight
to
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
and
tell
him
how
mean
he
had
been
to
spy
and
so
find
the
new
house
that
chatterer
was
trying
to
keep
a
secret
and
then
he
had
overheard
chatterer
telling
tommy
tit
the
chickadee
how
he
had
fooled
peter
and
that
peter
didn
t
know
where
the
new
house
was
at
all
peter
had
never
felt
more
foolish
in
his
life
no
sir
he
never
had
felt
more
foolish
in
his
life
of
course
if
it
were
true
that
he
had
been
fooled
and
really
didn
t
know
where
chatterer
s
new
house
was
there
was
no
use
in
begging
chatterer
s
pardon
for
he
would
only
make
himself
still
more
of
a
laughing
stock
than
he
was
already
and
yet
the
thing
he
had
done
was
just
as
mean
as
if
he
had
found
out
chatterer
s
secret
and
he
knew
that
he
would
feel
better
if
he
owned
up
he
scratched
his
left
ear
with
his
right
hind
foot
and
then
scratched
his
right
ear
with
his
left
hind
foot
he
pulled
his
whiskers
and
still
he
didn
t
know
what
to
do
he
was
still
trying
to
decide
when
he
heard
a
great
racket
in
the
direction
of
the
green
forest
it
was
sammy
jay
screaming
noisily
as
usual
and
he
was
hurrying
straight
up
to
the
old
orchard
of
course
chatterer
heard
him
and
as
soon
as
sammy
was
within
hearing
he
called
to
him
sammy
hurried
over
at
once
so
here
you
are
he
exclaimed
i
ve
hunted
all
through
the
green
forest
for
you
until
i
m
quite
tuckered
out
i
ve
got
news
for
you
what
is
it
begged
chatterer
dancing
about
with
impatience
i
ve
seen
shadow
the
weasel
replied
sammy
where
is
he
asked
chatterer
and
his
voice
sounded
very
anxious
he
s
over
in
the
green
forest
and
he
says
he
is
going
to
stay
there
until
he
catches
you
if
he
has
to
stay
all
winter
replied
sammy
he
says
he
is
going
to
find
you
if
he
has
to
hunt
through
every
tree
in
the
green
forest
chatterer
actually
turned
pale
for
a
minute
didn
t
tell
him
that
i
wasn
t
in
the
green
forest
did
you
he
asked
of
course
i
didn
t
how
could
i
when
i
didn
t
know
it
myself
retorted
sammy
scornfully
you
won
t
tell
him
when
you
see
him
again
will
you
sammy
begged
chatterer
what
do
you
take
me
for
demanded
sammy
angrily
i
haven
t
got
any
love
for
you
chatterer
and
you
know
it
you
re
a
nuisance
and
i
m
not
a
bit
sorry
to
see
you
in
trouble
but
i
wouldn
t
turn
my
worst
enemy
over
to
such
a
cruel
robber
as
shadow
the
weasel
he
would
kill
me
just
as
quickly
as
he
would
you
if
he
could
catch
me
which
he
can
t
and
i
am
going
to
make
it
my
business
to
see
to
it
that
all
the
little
people
who
are
afraid
of
him
know
that
he
is
about
i
am
going
over
to
the
old
right
away
to
warn
peter
rabbit
you
don
t
need
to
because
i
am
right
here
spoke
up
peter
from
his
hiding
place
i
am
ever
so
much
obliged
to
you
for
planning
to
warn
me
and
i
m
sorry
i
ve
ever
said
mean
things
about
you
sammy
jay
pooh
replied
sammy
you
needn
t
be
i
guess
i
ve
deserved
them
then
sammy
and
peter
and
chatterer
began
to
talk
over
the
news
about
shadow
the
weasel
so
eagerly
that
not
one
of
them
saw
black
pussy
stealing
along
the
old
stone
wall
pussy
almost
catches
a
good
black
pussy
was
out
very
early
hunting
for
her
breakfast
not
that
she
needed
to
hunt
for
her
breakfast
oh
my
no
black
pussy
didn
t
need
a
single
thing
every
morning
farmer
brown
s
boy
filled
a
saucer
with
warm
fresh
milk
for
her
and
every
day
she
had
all
the
meat
that
was
good
for
her
so
there
wasn
t
the
least
need
in
the
world
for
her
to
go
hunting
black
pussy
was
just
like
all
cats
lying
before
the
fire
in
farmer
brown
s
house
blinking
and
purring
contentedly
she
seemed
too
and
gentle
to
hurt
any
one
and
all
farmer
brown
s
family
said
that
she
was
and
believed
it
they
knew
nothing
about
the
empty
little
nests
in
the
joyful
springtime
because
black
pussy
had
found
them
and
emptied
them
and
broken
the
hearts
of
little
father
and
mother
birds
you
see
farmer
brown
s
folks
really
didn
t
know
black
pussy
but
the
little
forest
and
meadow
people
did
they
knew
that
black
pussy
was
just
like
all
cats
and
cruel
down
inside
they
hated
black
pussy
every
one
of
them
they
knew
that
down
in
her
heart
was
the
love
of
killing
just
that
same
love
of
killing
that
is
in
the
heart
of
shadow
the
weasel
and
so
they
hated
black
pussy
if
she
had
had
to
hunt
for
a
living
they
wouldn
t
have
minded
so
much
but
she
didn
t
have
to
hunt
for
a
living
and
so
they
hated
her
this
particular
morning
black
pussy
had
chosen
to
have
a
look
along
the
old
stone
wall
at
the
edge
of
the
old
orchard
many
times
she
had
hunted
striped
chipmunk
there
she
didn
t
know
enough
about
the
ways
of
the
little
people
of
the
green
forest
and
the
green
meadows
to
know
that
this
cold
weather
had
sent
striped
chipmunk
down
into
his
snug
bedroom
under
ground
for
a
long
sleep
so
she
sneaked
along
from
stone
to
stone
hoping
that
she
would
surprise
him
she
had
gone
half
the
length
of
the
old
wall
without
a
sign
of
anything
to
catch
when
she
heard
voices
that
put
all
thought
of
striped
chipmunk
out
of
her
head
crawling
flat
on
her
stomach
to
keep
out
of
sight
she
softly
worked
nearer
and
nearer
until
peeping
from
behind
a
big
stone
in
the
old
wall
she
could
see
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
peter
rabbit
and
sammy
jay
talking
so
busily
and
so
excited
that
they
didn
t
seem
to
be
paying
attention
to
anything
else
sammy
jay
was
safe
because
he
was
sitting
in
an
old
but
chatterer
was
on
the
old
wall
and
peter
was
on
the
ground
which
should
she
catch
peter
would
make
the
biggest
and
best
breakfast
but
black
pussy
hadn
t
forgotten
the
terrible
kick
he
had
once
given
her
when
she
had
caught
little
miss
fuzzytail
up
in
the
old
pasture
and
she
had
great
respect
for
peter
s
stout
hind
legs
she
would
be
content
to
catch
chatterer
this
morning
she
hated
him
anyway
for
he
had
been
very
saucy
to
her
many
times
he
would
never
make
fun
of
her
or
call
her
names
again
more
slowly
and
carefully
than
ever
black
pussy
stole
forward
her
eyes
grew
yellow
with
excitement
and
fierce
and
cruel
at
last
she
reached
a
place
where
one
good
jump
would
land
her
on
chatterer
carefully
she
drew
her
feet
under
her
to
make
the
jump
the
end
of
her
black
tail
twitched
with
eagerness
just
as
she
got
ready
to
spring
there
was
a
shrill
scream
from
sammy
jay
he
had
caught
sight
of
the
moving
tip
of
that
tail
and
he
knew
what
it
meant
black
pussy
sprang
but
she
was
just
too
late
chatterer
had
dived
headfirst
down
between
the
stones
of
the
old
wall
at
the
sound
of
sammy
s
scream
and
peter
had
dived
headfirst
into
johnny
chuck
s
house
on
the
doorstep
of
which
he
happened
to
be
sitting
black
pussy
looked
up
at
sammy
jay
and
snarled
at
him
in
a
terrible
rage
sammy
shrieked
at
her
just
as
angrily
then
when
her
head
was
turned
for
just
an
instant
he
darted
down
and
actually
pulled
a
tuft
of
hair
from
her
coat
and
was
safely
out
of
the
way
before
she
could
turn
and
spring
then
black
pussy
thrust
a
paw
down
between
the
stones
where
chatterer
had
disappeared
she
pulled
it
out
again
with
a
yowl
of
pain
for
sharp
little
teeth
had
bitten
it
slowly
and
sullenly
black
pussy
turned
and
limped
back
towards
farmer
brown
s
house
she
suddenly
remembered
that
saucer
of
milk
and
that
that
was
really
all
the
breakfast
she
wanted
works
when
chatterer
had
left
the
green
forest
because
of
his
terrible
fear
of
shadow
the
weasel
he
had
been
fat
at
least
he
had
been
fat
for
him
all
through
the
pleasant
fall
while
he
had
been
gathering
his
supply
of
nuts
and
seeds
to
store
away
for
the
winter
he
had
eaten
all
he
could
hold
and
had
filled
his
red
coat
out
until
it
actually
felt
too
tight
but
now
that
same
red
coat
hung
so
loose
on
chatterer
that
it
looked
too
big
for
him
yes
sir
chatterer
had
grown
so
thin
that
his
coat
actually
looked
too
big
for
him
and
he
was
growing
thinner
every
day
you
see
most
of
the
food
had
been
collected
and
stored
away
long
ago
and
chatterer
had
to
run
about
a
great
deal
and
hunt
very
hard
to
find
enough
to
eat
day
by
day
while
as
for
filling
a
new
seemed
impossible
still
chatterer
kept
trying
and
day
by
day
he
managed
to
add
a
little
to
the
supply
of
seeds
but
it
was
pretty
poor
fare
at
best
there
were
no
plump
nuts
or
tasty
such
as
filled
his
in
the
green
forest
because
no
nut
or
grew
near
the
old
orchard
and
chatterer
didn
t
dare
go
back
to
the
green
forest
for
fear
that
shadow
the
weasel
would
find
him
and
track
him
to
his
new
home
so
he
patiently
did
his
best
to
find
food
close
at
hand
but
it
was
discouraging
terribly
discouraging
to
work
from
to
running
here
running
there
running
everywhere
until
he
was
so
tired
he
was
ready
to
drop
and
knowing
all
the
time
that
the
snow
might
come
any
day
and
bury
what
little
food
there
was
oh
those
were
hard
days
for
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
very
hard
days
indeed
one
morning
he
started
very
early
and
made
a
long
journey
by
way
of
the
old
stone
wall
and
the
rail
fences
down
to
farmer
brown
s
cornfield
of
course
farmer
brown
had
long
ago
taken
away
the
corn
but
in
doing
it
a
great
many
grains
had
been
scattered
about
on
the
ground
half
buried
where
they
had
been
trodden
on
hidden
under
leaves
and
among
weeds
and
under
the
piles
of
stalks
from
which
the
ears
had
been
stripped
for
the
first
time
for
days
chatterer
felt
something
like
cheer
in
his
heart
as
he
scurried
about
hunting
for
and
finding
the
plump
yellow
grains
first
he
ate
all
he
could
hold
for
he
saw
that
then
there
would
be
plenty
to
take
home
then
he
stuffed
his
cheeks
full
scrambled
up
on
the
rail
fence
and
started
for
his
new
home
in
the
old
orchard
it
is
a
terrible
long
way
to
have
to
carry
all
my
supplies
thought
he
as
he
sat
up
on
the
top
of
a
post
to
rest
i
don
t
see
how
i
ever
can
do
it
well
i
certainly
can
t
if
i
sit
here
all
day
with
that
he
jumped
down
to
the
rail
below
him
he
was
half
way
across
when
he
noticed
a
crack
in
it
it
looked
to
him
as
if
that
rail
were
hollow
part
way
a
great
idea
came
to
him
his
eyes
grew
bright
with
excitement
he
ran
the
length
of
the
rail
and
back
again
looking
for
an
opening
there
was
none
then
very
slowly
and
carefully
he
worked
his
way
back
stretching
his
head
over
so
that
he
could
look
underneath
almost
over
to
the
next
post
he
found
what
he
had
so
hoped
to
find
what
was
it
why
a
yes
sir
a
that
opened
right
into
the
hollow
in
the
rail
it
wasn
t
quite
big
enough
for
chatterer
to
squeeze
through
but
that
didn
t
trouble
him
he
emptied
the
corn
from
his
cheeks
and
then
he
went
to
work
with
those
sharp
teeth
of
his
and
in
a
little
while
a
very
little
while
that
was
plenty
big
enough
for
chatterer
to
slip
through
his
eyes
snapped
with
pleasure
as
he
explored
the
hollow
rail
i
ll
make
this
my
he
cried
i
ll
fill
it
full
of
corn
and
then
when
i
am
hungry
in
the
winter
i
can
run
down
here
and
fill
up
it
will
be
a
lot
better
than
trying
to
carry
the
corn
up
to
the
old
orchard
and
with
that
chatterer
began
the
work
of
filling
the
hollow
rail
with
corn
jay
drops
a
whatever
faults
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
may
have
and
they
are
many
laziness
is
not
one
of
them
no
sir
there
is
no
laziness
about
chatterer
when
he
has
work
to
do
he
does
it
and
he
keeps
at
it
until
it
is
finished
every
morning
he
got
up
with
the
sun
and
raced
along
the
old
stone
wall
and
the
rail
fences
down
to
farmer
brown
s
cornfield
where
he
first
ate
his
breakfast
and
then
worked
to
fill
the
hollow
rail
of
the
fence
which
he
had
made
into
a
it
was
hard
work
because
he
had
to
do
a
great
deal
of
hunting
for
the
corn
and
it
was
exciting
work
because
he
had
to
keep
his
eyes
and
ears
open
every
minute
to
keep
from
furnishing
a
dinner
for
some
one
else
redtail
the
hawk
who
had
not
yet
gone
south
discovered
him
one
morning
and
chatterer
dodged
behind
a
fence
post
just
in
time
after
that
redtail
was
on
hand
every
morning
watching
from
the
top
of
a
tree
for
chatterer
to
grow
careless
and
get
too
far
from
shelter
then
one
morning
reddy
fox
surprised
him
at
the
edge
of
a
heap
of
cornstalks
chatterer
had
just
time
to
wriggle
his
way
to
the
middle
of
the
heap
reddy
had
seen
him
and
he
could
smell
him
very
softly
reddy
tiptoed
around
the
pile
of
cornstalks
to
see
if
chatterer
had
come
out
on
the
other
side
then
he
came
back
to
where
chatterer
had
gone
in
and
excitedly
began
to
dig
making
the
dry
stalks
fly
right
and
left
he
made
so
much
noise
that
chatterer
felt
sure
that
he
wouldn
t
hear
him
move
and
he
didn
t
by
the
time
reddy
had
worked
his
way
to
the
middle
of
the
pile
chatterer
was
safe
in
his
in
the
hollow
rail
he
had
slipped
from
under
the
cornstalks
run
across
to
another
pile
worked
his
way
through
this
and
so
reached
the
fence
after
that
reddy
fox
came
every
morning
hoping
to
surprise
chatterer
but
chatterer
felt
quite
equal
to
fooling
reddy
and
redtail
of
course
they
interfered
with
his
work
and
were
very
bothersome
but
he
wasn
t
afraid
of
them
the
one
thing
he
did
fear
was
that
shadow
the
weasel
would
hear
where
he
was
that
thought
bothered
him
a
great
deal
one
morning
sammy
jay
just
happened
along
he
saw
reddy
fox
creeping
up
behind
some
bushes
at
the
edge
of
the
cornfield
and
at
once
sammy
began
to
scream
as
he
always
does
when
he
thinks
he
can
spoil
reddy
s
hunting
reddy
looked
up
at
him
and
showed
all
his
long
teeth
but
sammy
only
grinned
and
screamed
the
louder
then
reddy
walked
away
with
a
great
deal
of
dignity
for
he
knew
that
it
wasn
t
the
least
use
to
try
to
hunt
while
sammy
jay
was
about
when
he
had
disappeared
in
the
green
forest
sammy
returned
to
the
cornfield
and
there
he
found
chatterer
hard
at
work
i
m
much
obliged
sammy
for
driving
that
nuisance
away
he
bothers
me
a
great
deal
and
i
ve
got
to
do
a
lot
of
work
yet
to
fill
my
before
it
is
too
late
said
chatterer
as
he
hurried
to
the
hollow
rail
with
his
mouth
full
of
corn
have
you
moved
down
here
demanded
sammy
jay
i
thought
you
were
living
up
in
the
old
orchard
i
am
at
least
my
house
is
up
there
but
there
is
no
food
there
and
so
i
have
made
a
down
here
and
am
trying
to
get
it
full
of
corn
before
snow
comes
replied
chatterer
it
will
be
a
long
way
to
come
for
your
food
every
day
said
sammy
i
know
it
replied
chatterer
but
i
guess
i
m
lucky
to
have
any
food
to
come
for
pooh
said
sammy
i
wouldn
t
work
as
you
do
i
d
use
my
wits
a
little
if
corn
is
what
you
want
to
eat
why
don
t
you
go
up
to
farmer
brown
s
it
s
nearer
to
the
old
orchard
than
this
and
the
corn
is
all
stored
ready
for
you
to
help
yourself
i
get
all
i
want
there
screws
up
his
ever
since
sammy
jay
had
dropped
a
hint
about
the
plentiful
supply
of
corn
over
at
farmer
brown
s
and
how
easy
it
was
to
get
all
that
one
wanted
chatterer
had
been
trying
to
screw
up
his
courage
to
go
see
for
himself
if
sammy
had
told
the
truth
chatterer
had
spent
most
of
his
life
in
or
close
to
the
green
forest
he
had
a
very
wholesome
fear
of
farmer
brown
s
boy
and
his
dreadful
gun
and
he
always
had
been
content
to
keep
away
from
farmer
brown
s
the
truth
is
he
was
afraid
to
go
up
there
you
see
there
were
black
pussy
the
cat
and
bowser
the
hound
and
farmer
brown
s
it
was
a
terribly
dangerous
place
and
yet
sammy
jay
went
up
there
every
day
and
didn
t
seem
to
be
in
the
least
afraid
he
even
scolded
and
said
impudent
things
to
farmer
brown
s
boy
if
sammy
dared
go
up
there
why
shouldn
t
he
he
certainly
was
as
brave
as
sammy
jay
right
down
in
his
heart
chatterer
had
always
thought
sammy
jay
very
much
of
a
coward
yet
here
was
sammy
going
up
there
and
helping
himself
to
corn
just
as
if
it
belonged
to
him
chatterer
thought
how
hard
he
worked
every
day
to
fill
that
in
the
hollow
and
how
every
minute
of
the
time
he
had
to
watch
out
for
redtail
the
hawk
and
reddy
fox
it
seemed
as
if
he
never
never
could
get
enough
corn
to
keep
him
all
winter
and
then
it
was
a
long
way
to
go
every
day
from
the
old
orchard
down
to
the
cornfield
chatterer
sighed
at
the
thought
if
sammy
jay
told
me
the
truth
and
it
is
so
easy
to
get
all
the
corn
one
wants
over
there
at
farmer
brown
s
it
will
be
ever
so
much
easier
in
bad
weather
thought
chatterer
anyway
it
won
t
do
any
harm
to
have
a
look
and
see
for
myself
how
things
are
so
chatterer
started
running
briskly
along
the
old
stone
wall
which
led
right
up
to
farmer
brown
s
yard
as
he
drew
near
he
would
stop
every
few
steps
to
make
sure
that
the
way
was
clear
at
last
he
reached
the
very
end
of
the
wall
and
hiding
between
two
stones
he
peeked
out
right
across
a
wide
road
was
farmer
brown
s
house
and
in
the
sun
on
the
back
doorstep
sat
black
pussy
dozing
chatterer
had
hard
work
to
hold
his
tongue
the
very
sight
of
her
made
him
so
angry
that
he
almost
forgot
that
he
didn
t
want
to
be
seen
he
just
longed
to
tell
her
what
he
thought
of
her
but
he
kept
still
and
set
his
sharp
little
eyes
to
discover
where
farmer
brown
kept
his
corn
he
could
see
bowser
the
hound
fast
asleep
in
front
of
his
own
special
little
house
he
could
see
the
big
barn
and
the
henhouse
and
the
shed
where
the
wagons
were
kept
and
the
long
i
wonder
said
chatterer
to
himself
i
wonder
if
that
corn
is
kept
in
any
of
those
places
and
how
sammy
jay
gets
it
if
it
is
just
then
farmer
brown
s
boy
came
out
of
the
barn
chatterer
dodged
back
at
sight
of
him
he
wanted
to
scold
just
as
he
had
wanted
to
scold
at
black
pussy
but
he
wisely
held
his
tongue
farmer
brown
s
boy
didn
t
even
look
towards
him
but
went
straight
over
to
a
queer
little
building
standing
high
on
four
legs
and
with
wide
cracks
between
the
boards
of
the
walls
through
which
something
yellow
showed
farmer
brown
s
boy
went
up
several
steps
and
opened
a
door
chatterer
gave
a
little
gasp
there
was
the
corn
more
corn
than
he
ever
had
seen
in
all
his
life
more
corn
than
he
had
supposed
the
whole
world
held
chatterer
made
up
his
mind
right
then
and
there
that
he
was
going
to
have
some
of
that
corn
in
spite
of
black
pussy
and
bowser
the
hound
and
farmer
brown
s
boy
the
very
sight
of
it
screwed
his
courage
up
till
he
felt
brave
enough
to
dare
anything
illustration
farmer
brown
s
boy
didn
t
even
look
towards
him
studies
a
way
to
get
farmer
brown
s
chatterer
could
think
of
but
one
brown
s
house
full
of
corn
and
how
he
could
get
some
of
it
sammy
jay
had
said
that
he
got
all
he
wanted
and
chatterer
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
see
how
sammy
did
it
so
very
early
the
next
morning
chatterer
was
in
his
hiding
place
between
the
stones
of
the
old
wall
just
as
sun
shot
his
first
red
rays
in
at
the
windows
of
farmer
brown
s
house
sammy
jay
arrived
for
a
wonder
he
made
no
noise
chatterer
noticed
this
right
away
sammy
peered
this
way
and
that
way
without
making
the
least
sound
when
he
was
quite
sure
that
no
one
was
about
he
flew
over
to
the
queer
little
house
on
four
legs
where
farmer
brown
kept
his
corn
and
thrust
his
bill
in
between
the
wide
cracks
of
the
wall
in
this
way
he
helped
himself
to
all
the
corn
he
wanted
without
the
least
bit
of
trouble
when
he
had
enough
he
flew
away
as
quietly
as
he
had
come
chatterer
grinned
sammy
has
taught
me
something
although
he
doesn
t
know
it
said
he
to
himself
he
s
stealing
that
corn
and
he
doesn
t
think
it
safe
to
be
found
out
i
must
be
just
as
careful
as
he
is
there
were
no
signs
of
any
one
around
farmer
brown
s
house
chatterer
scurried
across
the
yard
as
fast
as
his
little
legs
would
take
him
straight
for
the
little
house
there
he
found
a
great
disappointment
he
couldn
t
get
up
to
the
cracks
through
which
sammy
jay
had
helped
himself
to
corn
you
see
the
little
house
stood
on
four
stone
legs
and
before
it
had
been
put
on
those
four
legs
an
old
pan
had
been
placed
bottom
up
on
each
leg
it
would
be
the
hardest
kind
of
hard
work
to
climb
one
of
those
stone
legs
anyway
and
even
if
he
did
succeed
in
climbing
it
there
was
no
way
of
getting
around
that
tin
pan
at
the
top
and
of
course
he
couldn
t
gnaw
through
it
chatterer
ground
his
teeth
with
anger
it
was
so
terribly
provoking
to
be
so
near
such
a
feast
and
still
not
be
able
to
get
to
it
he
wished
he
had
wings
like
sammy
jay
chatterer
was
so
intent
on
studying
out
some
way
to
get
at
that
corn
that
he
quite
forgot
everything
else
the
rustle
of
a
leaf
made
him
turn
his
head
goodness
gracious
there
was
black
pussy
within
two
jumps
of
him
and
her
eyes
were
yellow
with
fierce
desire
chatterer
darted
to
the
nearest
tree
and
scrambled
up
as
fast
as
he
could
he
wasn
t
the
least
bit
afraid
now
because
he
knew
that
he
could
run
out
on
the
little
branches
where
black
pussy
would
not
dare
to
follow
him
so
he
faced
about
and
he
called
black
pussy
everything
bad
he
knew
of
when
she
had
slunk
away
chatterer
scampered
to
the
very
top
of
the
tree
to
think
matters
over
and
right
then
he
discovered
a
way
to
get
the
corn
from
farmer
brown
s
little
house
grows
chatterer
saw
that
a
branch
of
the
very
tree
he
was
sitting
in
stretched
right
over
the
roof
of
the
little
house
and
the
very
tips
of
some
of
the
twigs
actually
touched
it
chatterer
s
eyes
danced
if
i
can
t
get
in
from
the
ground
perhaps
i
can
get
in
from
the
air
said
he
and
chuckled
chatterer
looked
around
hastily
to
see
if
any
one
was
watching
no
one
was
in
sight
but
black
pussy
watching
him
from
the
ground
he
didn
t
mind
her
up
there
so
he
ran
lightly
out
along
the
branch
over
the
roof
of
the
little
house
and
jumped
on
to
it
swiftly
he
ran
around
the
edge
of
it
peeping
over
he
was
looking
for
an
opening
big
enough
to
crawl
through
at
last
over
in
one
corner
he
spied
a
knothole
close
up
under
the
edge
of
the
roof
chatterer
dug
his
sharp
claws
into
the
wood
to
keep
from
falling
and
very
carefully
crept
over
until
he
had
safely
reached
the
hole
it
wasn
t
quite
big
enough
to
push
his
head
wholly
through
gnaw
gnaw
gnaw
the
little
splinters
began
to
fly
gnaw
gnaw
gnaw
the
hole
was
big
enough
and
chatterer
slipped
safely
inside
just
as
farmer
brown
s
boy
came
out
of
the
house
and
noticed
black
pussy
sitting
on
the
ground
staring
up
at
the
roof
of
the
little
house
hello
puss
did
you
think
you
heard
a
mouse
in
there
exclaimed
farmer
brown
s
boy
you
didn
t
because
no
mice
can
get
in
there
come
along
over
to
the
barn
and
i
ll
give
you
some
nice
fresh
warm
milk
phew
exclaimed
chatterer
to
himself
that
was
a
narrow
escape
i
m
glad
that
pesky
black
cat
can
t
tell
what
she
saw
when
they
were
out
of
sight
chatterer
turned
to
see
what
kind
of
a
place
he
was
in
his
eyes
glistened
with
greed
corn
corn
com
everywhere
it
seemed
to
him
there
was
corn
enough
for
all
the
squirrels
in
the
world
and
it
s
all
mine
gasped
chatterer
quite
forgetting
that
he
was
stealing
then
he
began
to
eat
and
he
ate
and
ate
until
he
couldn
t
swallow
another
mouthful
i
believe
i
ll
take
a
nap
right
here
said
he
to
himself
and
curled
up
in
the
darkest
corner
in
two
minutes
he
was
fast
asleep
dreaming
that
all
the
world
seemed
to
have
turned
to
golden
corn
and
all
for
him
frightens
sammy
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
was
mightily
tickled
with
himself
because
he
had
found
a
way
of
getting
into
farmer
brown
s
where
was
stored
so
much
beautiful
yellow
corn
that
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
enough
for
all
the
squirrels
in
the
world
the
more
some
people
have
the
more
they
want
it
is
the
very
worst
kind
of
selfishness
and
is
called
greediness
chatterer
had
found
a
way
to
get
all
the
corn
he
wanted
without
working
for
it
and
there
was
enough
to
feed
him
as
long
as
he
lived
though
he
should
live
to
be
a
hundred
years
old
to
be
sure
it
wasn
t
his
it
was
farmer
brown
s
but
chatterer
looked
on
farmer
brown
and
farmer
brown
s
boy
as
his
enemies
and
he
could
see
nothing
wrong
in
taking
things
from
his
enemies
perhaps
he
didn
t
want
to
see
anything
wrong
all
his
life
he
had
stolen
from
his
neighbors
that
is
one
reason
they
dislike
him
so
anyway
if
ever
a
little
voice
down
inside
tried
to
tell
him
that
he
was
doing
wrong
chatterer
didn
t
listen
to
it
perhaps
after
a
while
the
little
voice
grew
tired
and
didn
t
try
any
more
after
chatterer
had
made
a
few
successful
trips
to
the
he
began
to
look
upon
it
as
his
own
he
would
sometimes
hide
in
the
old
stone
wall
where
he
could
watch
farmer
brown
s
boy
open
the
door
of
the
and
fill
a
basket
with
yellow
ears
to
feed
to
the
hens
and
the
pigs
and
the
horses
at
such
times
chatterer
would
work
himself
into
a
great
rage
as
if
farmer
brown
s
boy
were
stealing
from
him
but
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
about
it
so
he
would
go
back
to
the
old
orchard
and
scold
for
an
hour
but
what
made
him
still
angrier
was
to
see
sammy
jay
help
himself
to
a
few
grains
of
corn
from
between
the
cracks
in
the
walls
of
the
he
forgot
how
sammy
had
first
told
him
about
the
and
how
sammy
had
warned
him
about
shadow
the
weasel
that
is
the
trouble
with
greed
it
forgets
everything
but
the
desire
to
have
and
to
keep
others
from
having
chatterer
didn
t
say
anything
to
sammy
jay
because
he
knew
it
would
be
of
no
use
besides
if
he
did
sammy
might
meet
him
over
in
the
some
day
and
make
such
a
fuss
that
farmer
brown
s
boy
would
find
him
finally
chatterer
thought
of
a
plan
and
chuckled
wickedly
the
next
morning
he
was
over
in
the
bright
and
early
this
time
he
stayed
there
until
it
was
time
for
sammy
jay
to
arrive
peeping
out
of
the
hole
by
which
he
came
and
went
he
saw
sammy
come
flying
from
the
old
orchard
sammy
made
no
noise
for
you
see
sammy
meant
to
steal
too
presently
sammy
found
a
crack
against
which
an
ear
of
corn
lay
very
close
he
began
to
peck
at
it
and
pick
out
the
grains
chatterer
stole
over
to
it
taking
the
greatest
care
not
to
make
a
sound
presently
sammy
s
black
bill
came
poking
through
the
crack
chatterer
seized
it
and
held
on
poor
sammy
jay
he
was
terribly
frightened
he
thought
that
it
was
some
kind
of
a
trap
he
beat
his
wings
and
tried
to
scream
but
couldn
t
because
he
couldn
t
open
his
mouth
then
chatterer
let
go
so
suddenly
that
sammy
almost
fell
to
the
ground
before
he
could
catch
his
balance
he
didn
t
wait
to
see
what
had
caught
him
he
started
for
the
green
forest
as
fast
as
his
wings
could
take
him
and
as
he
went
he
screamed
with
fright
and
anger
chatterer
chuckled
and
his
chuckle
was
a
very
wicked
sounding
chuckle
i
guess
said
chatterer
that
sammy
jay
will
leave
my
corn
alone
after
this
jay
tells
his
troubles
to
reddy
sammy
jay
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
terrible
fright
he
had
had
at
farmer
brown
s
he
had
thrust
his
bill
through
a
crack
for
a
few
grains
of
corn
when
something
had
seized
his
bill
and
hung
on
sammy
didn
t
have
the
least
bit
of
doubt
that
it
was
a
trap
of
some
kind
set
by
farmer
brown
s
boy
he
flew
down
to
the
green
forest
to
think
it
over
and
plan
some
way
to
get
even
with
farmer
brown
s
boy
as
he
sat
there
muttering
to
himself
along
came
reddy
fox
for
a
wonder
reddy
saw
sammy
before
sammy
saw
him
reddy
grinned
sammy
certainly
has
got
something
on
his
mind
thought
reddy
then
he
said
aloud
hello
sammy
what
s
the
matter
you
look
as
if
you
had
the
and
the
and
a
few
other
aches
matter
enough
reddy
fox
matter
enough
snapped
sammy
then
because
he
felt
that
he
just
had
to
tell
some
one
he
told
reddy
all
about
his
terrible
fright
that
morning
it
was
a
trap
said
sammy
it
was
some
kind
of
a
trap
set
by
farmer
brown
s
boy
just
as
if
he
couldn
t
spare
a
few
grains
of
corn
when
he
has
got
so
much
d
like
peck
his
eyes
out
that
s
what
i
d
like
to
do
sammy
said
that
because
it
was
the
most
dreadful
thing
he
could
think
of
but
he
didn
t
really
mean
it
reddy
knew
it
and
grinned
for
he
also
knew
that
sammy
didn
t
dare
go
near
enough
to
farmer
brown
s
boy
to
more
than
scream
at
him
all
the
time
he
had
been
listening
reddy
had
sat
with
his
head
cocked
on
one
side
which
is
a
way
he
has
when
he
is
thinking
inside
he
was
laughing
for
reddy
knows
a
lot
about
traps
and
about
farmer
brown
s
boy
and
he
didn
t
believe
that
farmer
brown
s
boy
would
ever
set
a
trap
in
such
a
queer
place
as
a
crack
in
the
wall
of
a
he
wouldn
t
bother
to
try
to
trap
sammy
jay
he
would
just
watch
with
his
gun
and
shoot
sammy
if
he
really
cared
about
the
few
grains
of
corn
sammy
has
taken
thought
reddy
it
was
some
one
or
something
else
that
frightened
sammy
but
it
isn
t
the
least
bit
of
use
to
tell
him
so
i
believe
i
ll
have
a
look
and
see
what
is
going
on
at
that
aloud
he
said
that
was
a
terrible
experience
sammy
jay
and
i
don
t
wonder
that
you
were
frightened
are
you
going
up
there
morning
what
screamed
sammy
going
up
there
again
what
do
you
take
me
for
i
guess
i
don
t
need
but
one
lesson
of
that
kind
there
s
plenty
to
eat
in
the
green
forest
and
on
the
green
meadows
without
running
any
such
risk
as
that
no
sir
you
won
t
catch
me
around
farmer
brown
s
again
very
soon
not
if
my
name
is
sammy
jay
you
are
wise
very
wise
replied
reddy
gravely
it
is
always
wise
to
keep
out
of
danger
and
with
this
reddy
trotted
on
up
the
lone
little
path
and
inside
his
red
head
were
busy
thoughts
reddy
had
made
up
his
mind
that
there
was
something
very
queer
about
sammy
jay
s
fright
and
he
meant
to
find
out
about
it
he
would
be
on
hand
at
the
first
peep
of
day
the
next
morning
and
see
what
was
going
on
around
farmer
brown
s
and
all
day
long
sammy
jay
flew
about
through
the
green
forest
telling
every
one
who
would
listen
how
farmer
brown
s
boy
had
tried
to
trap
him
late
that
afternoon
he
visited
the
old
orchard
and
told
his
story
all
over
again
to
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
and
chatterer
didn
t
so
much
as
smile
until
after
sammy
had
left
then
he
threw
himself
on
the
ground
and
rolled
over
and
over
and
laughed
until
his
sides
ached
fox
plays
reddy
fox
didn
t
have
to
get
up
early
to
be
hiding
behind
the
fence
back
of
farmer
brown
s
when
jolly
round
red
sun
chased
the
little
stars
from
the
sky
he
didn
t
have
to
get
up
early
for
the
very
good
reason
that
he
hadn
t
been
to
bed
you
see
reddy
fox
does
a
great
many
things
that
he
wouldn
t
like
to
have
seen
and
so
he
does
them
in
the
night
when
most
of
the
other
little
people
of
the
green
meadows
and
the
green
forest
are
asleep
and
so
it
happens
that
often
he
does
not
go
to
bed
at
all
at
night
but
sleeps
in
the
day
when
most
honest
people
are
abroad
he
had
been
roaming
about
all
this
night
and
now
he
had
come
to
watch
and
see
what
was
going
on
at
farmer
brown
s
and
whether
or
not
farmer
brown
s
boy
had
been
setting
a
trap
there
for
sammy
jay
as
sammy
was
so
sure
he
had
just
as
the
little
stars
disappeared
and
the
first
faint
light
from
sun
began
to
chase
away
the
black
shadows
reddy
s
sharp
eyes
saw
something
move
over
at
the
corner
of
the
old
stone
wall
at
the
edge
of
the
old
orchard
then
a
little
dark
form
scampered
across
the
road
and
there
was
the
scratch
of
sharp
little
claws
on
the
tree
growing
near
the
reddy
grinned
and
watched
the
top
of
the
tree
in
a
minute
the
same
little
form
ran
out
along
a
limb
that
overhung
the
and
nimbly
jumped
to
the
roof
it
ran
along
one
edge
and
suddenly
disappeared
reddy
guessed
right
away
that
there
was
a
hole
there
he
arose
and
stretched
i
thought
as
much
said
reddy
to
himself
i
thought
as
much
then
he
lay
down
to
watch
again
after
a
while
out
popped
the
same
lively
little
form
it
was
quite
light
now
light
enough
for
reddy
to
see
the
red
coat
of
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
chatterer
s
cheeks
were
stuffed
so
full
of
corn
that
his
head
looked
twice
as
large
as
it
really
is
he
ran
along
the
roof
to
where
the
tips
of
the
limb
of
the
tree
brushed
the
roof
climbed
into
the
tree
looked
sharply
to
make
sure
that
no
one
was
about
particularly
black
pussy
and
then
ran
down
the
tree
and
scurried
across
the
road
to
the
safety
of
the
old
stone
wall
ha
said
reddy
fox
i
thought
so
unless
i
am
much
very
very
much
mistaken
chatterer
can
tell
sammy
jay
what
caught
him
by
the
bill
yesterday
morning
and
frightened
him
nearly
to
death
i
ve
wondered
why
he
no
longer
came
to
that
new
of
his
that
he
worked
so
hard
to
fill
down
at
the
edge
of
the
cornfield
and
now
i
know
my
but
chatterer
is
getting
fat
i
think
he
will
make
me
a
very
good
breakfast
i
do
indeed
reddy
licked
his
lips
as
if
he
could
already
taste
fat
red
squirrel
and
then
slipped
away
in
the
other
direction
for
it
was
getting
so
light
that
he
dared
stay
no
longer
so
near
to
farmer
brown
s
house
and
bowser
the
hound
all
the
way
to
the
green
forest
reddy
grinned
partly
at
thought
of
the
sharp
trick
he
was
sure
chatterer
had
played
on
sammy
jay
and
partly
at
thought
of
the
good
breakfast
he
was
sure
he
would
have
one
of
these
fine
mornings
for
already
he
had
thought
of
a
plan
to
catch
chatterer
but
first
he
would
find
sammy
jay
he
wanted
to
see
how
foolish
sammy
would
look
when
he
found
out
that
it
wasn
t
a
trap
of
farmer
brown
s
boy
s
at
all
that
had
frightened
him
so
jay
spoils
the
plan
of
reddy
reddy
fox
found
sammy
jay
in
a
bad
temper
sammy
had
missed
his
usual
breakfast
of
corn
stolen
from
farmer
brown
s
and
it
had
made
him
cross
good
morning
said
reddy
in
his
politest
manner
and
no
one
can
be
more
polite
than
reddy
fox
when
he
sets
out
to
be
morning
mumbled
sammy
jay
i
found
out
something
this
morning
which
may
interest
you
said
reddy
taking
no
notice
of
sammy
s
cross
looks
it
won
t
replied
sammy
positively
it
won
t
nothing
interests
me
not
even
traps
asked
reddy
slyly
what
s
that
demanded
sammy
looking
at
reddy
sharply
oh
nothing
much
replied
reddy
quite
as
if
the
matter
didn
t
interest
him
especially
only
i
found
out
something
this
morning
that
i
thought
you
might
like
to
see
if
you
wasn
t
such
a
coward
who
says
i
m
a
coward
shrieked
sammy
jay
dancing
about
with
anger
i
do
replied
reddy
you
don
t
dare
go
with
me
morning
and
see
what
is
going
on
at
farmer
brown
s
it
isn
t
true
sammy
shrieked
i
dare
go
wherever
you
dare
go
so
there
reddy
fox
then
i
dare
you
to
meet
me
morning
at
the
edge
of
the
green
forest
at
and
go
with
me
to
watch
farmer
brown
s
reddy
replied
i
ll
be
there
snapped
sammy
i
ll
have
you
to
understand
that
you
don
t
dare
do
anything
that
i
don
t
dare
do
snapped
sammy
though
to
tell
the
truth
he
had
felt
his
heart
sink
at
the
mere
mention
of
farmer
brown
s
for
you
remember
it
was
there
that
he
had
had
a
terrible
fright
only
the
morning
before
all
right
see
that
you
are
on
hand
at
sharp
replied
reddy
and
trotted
away
grinning
for
he
was
smart
enough
to
know
that
sammy
would
risk
a
great
deal
rather
than
be
called
a
coward
for
no
one
likes
to
be
called
a
coward
early
the
next
morning
reddy
fox
and
sammy
jay
met
at
the
edge
of
the
green
forest
now
reddy
explained
we
will
go
over
by
the
fence
back
of
the
i
will
hide
there
just
where
i
hid
yesterday
morning
and
you
will
hide
in
the
close
by
watch
the
roof
of
the
and
i
think
you
will
see
something
that
may
explain
how
you
happened
to
be
caught
by
the
bill
the
other
morning
but
whatever
you
see
don
t
make
a
sound
not
the
least
bit
of
a
sound
sammy
promised
and
they
hurried
over
to
their
hiding
places
hardly
had
sammy
settled
himself
in
the
when
he
saw
chatterer
jump
to
the
roof
of
the
from
the
limb
of
the
tree
which
overhung
it
almost
in
a
flash
chatterer
had
disappeared
through
a
hole
just
under
the
edge
of
the
roof
no
sooner
was
he
out
of
sight
than
reddy
fox
ran
swiftly
across
to
the
old
stone
wall
at
the
edge
of
the
old
orchard
and
hid
behind
it
right
away
sammy
jay
guessed
that
chatterer
had
had
something
to
do
with
the
terrible
fright
he
had
had
at
the
when
his
bill
was
caught
as
he
pecked
at
the
corn
between
the
cracks
in
the
wall
it
wasn
t
a
trap
at
all
but
chatterer
thought
sammy
and
right
away
grew
so
angry
that
he
could
hardly
sit
still
but
he
wanted
to
see
what
chatterer
would
do
next
so
he
bit
his
tongue
to
keep
it
still
pretty
soon
out
came
chatterer
with
his
cheeks
stuffed
full
of
corn
that
was
too
much
for
sammy
jay
he
forgot
all
about
his
promise
not
to
make
a
sound
he
darted
out
of
his
hiding
place
and
flew
at
chatterer
in
a
terrible
rage
screaming
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
calling
chatterer
every
bad
thing
he
could
think
of
of
course
chatterer
couldn
t
reply
because
his
cheeks
were
so
stuffed
with
corn
but
he
could
run
like
a
little
red
flash
he
was
in
the
tree
that
overhung
the
and
dodging
around
the
trunk
over
behind
the
stone
wall
reddy
fox
snarled
for
with
such
a
noise
he
knew
it
wasn
t
safe
to
stay
there
any
longer
and
sammy
jay
when
people
lose
their
tempers
oh
what
a
sorry
sight
they
call
each
other
dreadful
names
and
sometimes
scratch
and
bite
the
merry
little
breezes
ran
and
hid
themselves
away
when
chatterer
his
temper
lost
and
so
did
sammy
jay
it
really
was
too
dreadful
it
quite
spoiled
the
day
for
all
the
little
people
who
were
within
sound
of
their
voices
you
see
when
sammy
jay
discovered
that
it
was
chatterer
and
not
a
trap
set
by
farmer
brown
s
boy
that
had
given
him
such
a
fright
at
farmer
brown
s
right
away
sammy
s
temper
just
boiled
right
over
chatterer
had
his
mouth
so
full
of
corn
that
he
couldn
t
say
a
word
but
he
could
run
and
run
he
did
scampering
across
farmer
brown
s
dooryard
to
the
shelter
of
the
old
stone
wall
at
the
edge
of
the
old
orchard
with
sammy
after
him
screaming
thief
thief
thief
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
my
gracious
what
a
racket
exclaimed
farmer
brown
s
boy
as
he
opened
the
door
that
jay
is
making
such
a
fuss
that
i
should
think
there
was
a
fox
about
he
put
his
down
and
stepped
back
into
the
house
in
a
minute
he
was
out
again
with
his
terrible
gun
in
his
hands
he
went
straight
to
the
old
stone
wall
where
only
a
few
minutes
before
reddy
fox
had
been
hiding
and
it
was
well
for
reddy
that
he
had
slipped
away
the
minute
sammy
jay
began
to
scream
at
chatterer
farmer
brown
s
boy
looked
disappointed
when
he
saw
no
signs
of
reddy
then
he
went
over
to
the
little
house
of
bowser
the
hound
and
unchained
bowser
bowser
wagged
his
tail
and
yelped
with
delight
when
he
saw
the
gun
for
he
dearly
loves
to
hunt
he
ran
ahead
back
to
the
old
orchard
and
almost
at
once
his
great
deep
voice
told
all
within
hearing
that
his
wonderful
nose
had
found
the
tracks
of
reddy
fox
i
thought
so
said
farmer
brown
s
boy
i
thought
there
had
been
a
fox
here
then
he
sighed
for
he
would
have
liked
nothing
better
than
to
go
hunt
for
reddy
but
there
were
the
empty
and
farmer
brown
s
boy
is
not
the
kind
who
run
away
for
pleasure
when
there
is
work
to
be
done
sammy
jay
had
flown
away
as
soon
as
he
saw
farmer
brown
s
boy
and
his
terrible
gun
chatterer
had
hidden
in
the
old
stone
wall
where
he
safely
stored
away
the
corn
with
which
his
cheeks
had
been
stuffed
as
soon
as
farmer
brown
s
boy
had
gone
to
the
barn
to
milk
the
cows
sammy
jay
slipped
back
to
the
old
orchard
to
look
for
chatterer
and
his
temper
hadn
t
improved
a
bit
he
soon
saw
chatterer
running
along
the
old
wall
and
once
more
began
to
scream
thief
thief
and
now
that
his
mouth
was
empty
chatterer
could
reply
and
you
know
chatterer
has
one
of
the
worst
tongues
of
all
the
little
people
of
the
green
forest
thief
yourself
he
screamed
back
thief
yourself
you
stole
my
corn
it
isn
t
your
corn
any
more
than
it
s
mine
screamed
sammy
i
told
you
about
it
in
the
first
place
thief
thief
thief
and
from
that
they
fell
to
calling
each
other
worse
things
the
old
orchard
never
had
heard
such
a
quarrel
never
it
was
dreadful
all
day
long
they
kept
it
up
twice
farmer
brown
s
boy
came
down
to
see
if
that
fox
had
come
back
and
scratched
his
head
and
wondered
what
all
the
fuss
was
about
at
last
sammy
jay
had
a
thought
i
m
going
straight
over
to
the
green
forest
to
tell
shadow
the
weasel
where
you
are
living
he
cried
suddenly
when
he
finds
you
you
won
t
steal
any
more
corn
or
be
so
greedy
that
you
won
t
let
other
people
have
a
share
and
sammy
jay
make
when
chatterer
heard
sammy
jay
say
that
he
was
going
straight
to
the
green
forest
to
tell
shadow
the
weasel
that
chatterer
was
living
in
the
old
orchard
a
great
fear
filled
his
heart
he
forgot
his
quarrel
with
sammy
he
forgot
his
greed
for
all
the
corn
in
farmer
brown
s
he
forgot
everything
but
his
terrible
fear
of
shadow
the
weasel
it
was
because
of
shadow
that
chatterer
had
left
the
green
forest
to
live
in
the
old
orchard
if
shadow
should
find
him
here
he
didn
t
know
what
he
could
do
or
where
he
could
go
he
knew
that
sammy
jay
meant
just
what
he
said
for
though
it
would
be
a
dreadful
thing
to
do
people
do
dreadful
things
when
they
are
angry
and
sammy
jay
was
very
very
angry
indeed
he
had
already
spread
his
wings
when
chatterer
spoke
please
don
t
do
that
sammy
jay
he
begged
didn
t
mean
all
the
bad
things
i
have
said
sammy
jay
s
eyes
snapped
he
saw
right
away
that
chatterer
was
very
much
frightened
and
he
knew
that
hereafter
so
long
as
shadow
the
weasel
was
anywhere
around
chatterer
would
be
so
afraid
that
he
would
do
anything
sammy
might
want
him
to
you
see
sammy
jay
is
very
sharp
am
i
any
more
of
a
thief
than
you
are
he
demanded
replied
chatterer
slowly
as
if
it
were
the
hardest
work
to
say
it
illustration
replied
chatterer
slowly
will
you
play
any
more
tricks
on
me
asked
sammy
no
replied
chatterer
more
promptly
this
time
well
i
ll
think
it
over
and
make
up
my
mind
in
the
morning
said
sammy
perhaps
i
will
and
perhaps
i
won
t
tell
shadow
where
you
are
living
i
ll
think
it
over
now
sammy
knew
perfectly
well
that
chatterer
wouldn
t
sleep
a
wink
that
night
for
worrying
already
he
had
made
up
his
mind
not
to
tell
shadow
for
like
all
the
other
little
meadow
and
forest
people
he
hated
shadow
but
of
course
chatterer
couldn
t
know
that
he
had
so
made
up
his
mind
and
a
great
fear
that
sammy
might
tell
clutched
his
heart
if
you
ll
promise
not
to
tell
shadow
where
i
am
are
welcome
to
all
the
corn
you
want
at
farmer
brown
s
said
chatterer
in
a
very
meek
voice
indeed
replied
sammy
how
very
generous
of
you
seeing
that
it
doesn
t
belong
to
you
anyway
and
i
have
just
as
much
right
to
it
as
you
have
i
ll
help
you
get
it
continued
chatterer
his
sharp
wits
working
their
hardest
to
think
of
some
way
to
get
sammy
to
make
that
promise
how
asked
sammy
suspiciously
why
when
you
can
t
get
it
between
the
cracks
i
ll
bring
some
out
for
you
and
hide
it
in
the
stone
wall
where
you
can
find
it
replied
chatterer
but
in
his
heart
he
said
that
he
would
hide
it
so
that
sammy
would
have
to
hunt
a
long
time
to
find
it
it
seemed
almost
as
if
sammy
read
that
thought
for
cocking
his
head
on
one
side
he
said
i
ll
promise
not
to
tell
shadow
if
you
ll
promise
to
get
me
corn
whenever
i
want
it
and
put
it
just
where
i
tell
you
to
chatterer
didn
t
like
that
idea
at
all
but
what
could
he
do
he
thought
it
over
so
long
that
sammy
jay
spread
his
wings
as
if
to
start
that
very
instant
for
the
green
forest
i
promise
cried
chatterer
hastily
and
so
these
two
scamps
of
the
green
forest
made
up
and
planned
how
they
would
live
all
winter
on
farmer
brown
s
corn
has
to
keep
his
chatterer
wished
now
that
he
hadn
t
been
quite
so
greedy
if
he
had
been
content
to
let
sammy
jay
get
what
corn
he
could
from
farmer
brown
s
instead
of
playing
that
sharp
trick
to
frighten
him
away
chatterer
wouldn
t
have
had
to
make
that
promise
to
get
the
corn
for
sammy
and
put
it
wherever
sammy
wanted
it
put
it
wasn
t
much
to
do
chatterer
really
didn
t
mind
doing
the
thing
itself
it
was
the
thought
that
sammy
could
make
him
do
it
now
chatterer
has
sharp
wits
and
sammy
jay
has
sharp
wits
chatterer
had
always
thought
his
the
sharpest
and
it
hurt
his
pride
to
feel
that
sammy
had
got
the
best
of
him
he
couldn
t
think
of
anything
else
as
he
curled
up
for
the
night
in
his
snug
bed
in
the
old
home
of
drummer
the
woodpecker
up
in
the
old
orchard
he
thought
and
thought
and
thought
and
thought
trying
to
find
some
way
to
wriggle
out
of
his
promise
and
just
before
he
fell
asleep
an
idea
came
to
him
he
would
go
over
to
the
before
sammy
jay
was
awake
eat
his
fill
and
then
hide
from
sammy
why
didn
t
i
think
of
that
before
he
murmured
sleepily
and
smiled
to
think
how
after
all
his
wits
were
sharper
than
those
of
sammy
jay
the
next
morning
very
early
chatterer
visited
the
ate
a
hurried
breakfast
and
then
hid
in
the
old
stone
wall
to
watch
for
sammy
jay
but
sammy
didn
t
come
at
the
time
he
used
to
visit
the
before
chatterer
had
given
him
that
terrible
scare
chatterer
waited
and
waited
but
no
sammy
jay
chatterer
began
to
get
impatient
but
still
he
didn
t
dare
leave
his
hiding
place
for
fear
that
sammy
might
come
at
last
chatterer
decided
that
sammy
had
gone
somewhere
else
that
morning
so
he
came
out
of
his
hiding
place
and
frisked
along
the
stone
wall
at
one
edge
of
the
old
orchard
after
a
while
he
forgot
all
about
sammy
jay
anyway
he
was
sure
that
sammy
wouldn
t
think
of
going
to
the
so
late
in
the
morning
for
it
wouldn
t
be
safe
at
all
farmer
brown
s
boy
would
be
almost
sure
to
see
him
so
chatterer
forgot
his
troubles
and
frisked
about
and
had
a
splendid
time
all
by
himself
right
in
the
midst
of
it
sammy
jay
arrived
in
the
old
orchard
good
morning
chatterer
said
he
i
fear
i
am
a
little
late
for
breakfast
breakfast
sneered
chatterer
breakfast
why
it
s
nearer
dinner
time
i
had
my
breakfast
hours
ago
i
thought
likely
replied
sammy
and
there
was
a
mischievous
look
in
his
sharp
black
eyes
but
i
was
rather
tired
this
morning
and
as
long
as
i
hadn
t
got
to
go
way
over
to
the
myself
i
thought
i
wouldn
t
hurry
i
suppose
you
have
plenty
of
corn
ready
for
me
here
corn
ready
for
you
i
should
say
not
snapped
chatterer
you
didn
t
say
anything
about
getting
corn
for
you
this
morning
didn
t
i
well
i
guess
i
must
have
forgotten
to
never
can
run
over
there
and
get
some
for
me
now
replied
sammy
go
yourself
snapped
chatterer
i
think
i
d
rather
not
replied
sammy
farmer
brown
s
boy
is
chopping
wood
right
close
by
the
so
i
prefer
to
have
you
go
i
won
t
chatterer
fairly
screamed
and
danced
about
in
his
rage
i
won
t
oh
all
right
replied
sammy
yawning
i
saw
shadow
the
weasel
down
in
the
green
forest
this
morning
and
he
inquired
for
you
i
think
i
ll
go
look
him
up
again
chatterer
turned
pale
he
feared
shadow
the
weasel
more
than
any
one
else
under
the
sun
he
would
rather
face
farmer
brown
s
boy
ll
go
he
stammered
weakly
there
was
no
way
out
of
it
he
just
had
to
keep
his
promise
gets
sammy
jay
some
in
all
his
life
chatterer
had
never
felt
so
angry
and
so
helpless
he
had
thought
himself
so
smart
that
he
could
outwit
sammy
jay
and
instead
sammy
had
outwitted
him
this
was
bad
enough
in
itself
but
to
make
matters
worse
he
had
to
do
something
which
he
felt
was
very
dangerous
he
had
to
get
sammy
some
corn
from
farmer
brown
s
right
in
broad
daylight
and
there
was
black
pussy
sitting
on
the
doorstep
of
farmer
brown
s
house
and
farmer
brown
s
boy
himself
was
chopping
wood
close
by
the
but
if
he
didn
t
keep
his
promise
sammy
would
go
tell
shadow
the
weasel
where
he
was
living
and
chatterer
was
more
afraid
of
shadow
than
of
black
pussy
and
farmer
brown
s
boy
wasn
t
it
a
terrible
position
to
be
in
chatterer
thought
so
and
all
the
time
he
knew
that
it
was
all
his
own
fault
if
he
hadn
t
been
so
greedy
and
tried
to
scare
sammy
jay
away
from
the
he
wouldn
t
be
in
such
a
fix
now
he
ran
along
the
stone
wall
to
the
end
at
the
edge
of
farmer
brown
s
dooryard
then
he
peeped
out
black
pussy
was
dozing
on
the
doorstep
her
eyes
were
closed
chatterer
started
across
for
the
tree
close
by
the
and
then
his
courage
failed
and
he
ran
back
to
the
stone
wall
three
times
he
did
this
and
each
time
he
looked
up
to
see
sammy
jay
grinning
at
him
from
an
in
the
old
orchard
it
was
very
plain
to
see
that
sammy
was
enjoying
chatterer
s
fright
chatterer
almost
cried
with
fear
and
anger
the
fourth
time
he
gritted
his
teeth
and
kept
on
running
as
fast
as
he
knew
how
he
was
almost
past
black
pussy
when
she
opened
her
eyes
in
a
flash
she
was
after
him
chatterer
reached
the
tree
first
and
was
up
it
like
a
little
red
streak
there
he
felt
safe
at
least
he
felt
safe
from
black
pussy
for
she
wouldn
t
dare
follow
him
out
on
the
small
branches
but
farmer
brown
s
boy
had
seen
her
rush
across
to
the
foot
of
the
tree
and
now
he
stopped
chopping
wood
to
watch
black
pussy
glaring
up
at
chatterer
what
are
you
so
interested
in
puss
asked
farmer
brown
s
boy
he
couldn
t
see
chatterer
because
chatterer
was
smart
enough
to
keep
on
the
other
side
of
the
tree
trunk
is
it
something
you
want
me
to
see
he
continued
and
started
to
walk
over
to
the
tree
chatterer
s
heart
was
beating
terribly
with
thump
thump
at
just
that
minute
there
was
a
great
racket
over
in
the
old
orchard
thief
thief
thief
screamed
sammy
jay
making
a
great
fuss
farmer
brown
s
boy
turned
to
look
in
that
direction
i
wonder
if
that
fox
is
prowling
around
again
said
he
and
while
he
was
still
looking
and
wondering
chatterer
dropped
to
the
roof
of
the
and
slipped
inside
through
the
hole
he
had
found
under
the
edge
of
the
roof
he
gave
a
great
sigh
of
relief
i
believe
sammy
jay
did
that
purposely
to
make
farmer
brown
s
boy
look
over
there
instead
of
up
in
the
tree
he
muttered
and
he
was
right
sammy
had
no
desire
to
have
any
real
harm
come
to
chatterer
and
so
at
just
the
right
minute
he
had
fooled
farmer
brown
s
boy
just
as
he
often
had
fooled
him
before
by
screaming
as
if
he
saw
reddy
fox
when
reddy
wasn
t
there
at
all
when
farmer
brown
s
boy
was
sure
that
reddy
was
not
over
in
the
old
orchard
he
once
more
turned
to
black
pussy
who
was
still
glaring
up
at
the
place
where
chatterer
had
been
he
looked
up
too
but
of
course
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
i
guess
you
must
have
dreamed
you
saw
something
puss
said
he
stooping
to
stroke
her
gently
then
he
went
back
to
his
black
pussy
waited
a
few
minutes
longer
and
then
went
over
to
the
barn
to
try
to
console
herself
with
a
mouse
chatterer
watched
his
chance
and
got
back
to
the
old
stone
wall
safely
with
his
cheeks
stuffed
full
of
corn
for
sammy
jay
remembers
chatterer
was
disgusted
with
himself
with
all
his
neighbors
and
with
the
world
in
general
which
is
to
say
that
chatterer
was
very
much
put
out
about
something
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
he
couldn
t
see
anything
cheerful
in
the
sunshine
nor
anything
pleasant
in
the
blue
blue
sky
and
when
any
one
fails
to
see
cheerfulness
in
the
sunshine
or
to
find
something
pleasant
in
the
blue
blue
sky
there
is
something
wrong
in
his
own
heart
that
was
the
trouble
with
chatterer
there
was
a
great
deal
wrong
in
his
heart
in
the
first
place
it
was
filled
with
anger
and
anger
you
know
will
take
all
the
joy
and
pleasantness
out
of
anything
and
then
chatterer
was
mortified
he
was
both
angry
and
mortified
because
sammy
jay
had
proved
to
have
smarter
wits
than
he
had
so
as
soon
as
he
could
do
so
without
being
seen
he
slipped
into
his
new
home
in
the
old
house
of
drummer
the
woodpecker
in
an
in
the
old
orchard
and
there
he
sulked
for
the
rest
of
the
day
you
see
sammy
jay
had
made
him
go
over
to
farmer
brown
s
and
get
him
some
corn
right
in
broad
daylight
and
he
had
very
narrowly
escaped
being
seen
by
farmer
brown
s
boy
if
only
i
hadn
t
promised
to
get
him
corn
whenever
he
asks
me
to
he
said
over
and
over
to
himself
as
he
sulked
in
his
home
in
the
if
only
i
hadn
t
and
yet
i
couldn
t
help
just
had
to
now
whenever
he
feels
like
it
he
ll
make
me
do
as
he
did
and
perhaps
i
won
t
always
be
so
lucky
oh
dear
oh
dear
i
ve
got
myself
into
a
dreadful
mess
and
i
ve
just
got
to
think
of
some
way
out
of
it
so
all
the
rest
of
the
day
he
thought
and
thought
and
the
more
he
thought
the
more
unhappy
he
grew
it
wasn
t
until
just
as
he
was
going
out
for
a
breath
of
air
before
going
to
bed
for
the
night
that
the
great
idea
came
to
him
stupid
stupid
stupid
he
muttered
meaning
himself
why
didn
t
i
remember
it
before
you
won
t
see
me
going
over
to
that
again
jay
i
ll
get
you
the
corn
if
i
must
but
you
won
t
have
the
fun
of
laughing
at
me
trying
to
dodge
black
pussy
and
farmer
brown
s
boy
you
re
smart
jay
you
re
smart
but
you
ve
got
to
get
up
early
in
the
morning
to
play
such
a
trick
on
chatterer
twice
right
away
he
felt
so
much
better
in
his
mind
that
he
had
a
brisk
run
along
the
old
stone
wall
and
then
turned
in
for
a
good
night
s
sleep
the
next
day
sammy
jay
appeared
in
the
middle
of
the
forenoon
and
demanded
more
corn
chatterer
pretended
that
he
didn
t
dare
go
for
it
but
when
sammy
insisted
that
he
must
he
suddenly
started
do
you
think
why
for
that
of
his
in
the
hollow
rail
at
the
edge
of
the
cornfield
it
was
a
long
way
to
go
but
that
was
better
than
running
the
risk
of
being
seen
by
farmer
brown
s
boy
it
took
him
some
time
but
at
last
he
was
back
with
his
cheeks
stuffed
with
corn
sammy
jay
pretended
to
be
cross
because
he
had
been
kept
waiting
so
long
and
grumbled
all
the
time
he
was
eating
he
pretended
to
think
that
the
corn
was
not
as
good
as
that
from
farmer
brown
s
and
mumbled
something
about
telling
shadow
the
weasel
if
chatterer
didn
t
get
him
some
corn
from
the
crib
the
next
day
you
can
t
cried
chatterer
in
triumph
you
promised
not
to
tell
shadow
if
i
kept
my
promise
and
got
you
corn
whenever
you
asked
for
it
but
i
didn
t
say
where
i
would
get
it
and
he
chuckled
to
think
that
he
had
been
smarter
than
sammy
jay
sammy
ate
every
grain
and
then
went
off
but
as
he
went
chatterer
thought
he
heard
something
very
like
a
chuckle
it
made
him
thoughtful
and
a
little
uneasy
but
he
couldn
t
think
of
any
way
sammy
could
get
the
best
of
him
now
so
he
soon
forgot
it
and
all
the
rest
of
the
day
he
thought
of
how
lucky
it
was
that
he
had
remembered
that
in
the
hollow
rail
jay
makes
a
sammy
jay
hadn
t
had
so
much
fun
for
a
long
time
as
he
was
having
at
the
expense
of
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
no
sir
sammy
hadn
t
had
so
much
fun
for
as
long
as
he
could
remember
you
see
he
and
chatterer
never
had
been
very
good
friends
and
always
had
played
sharp
tricks
on
each
other
whenever
they
had
the
chance
sammy
had
not
forgotten
how
chatterer
had
stolen
the
eggs
of
drummer
the
woodpecker
in
the
spring
and
then
laid
the
blame
on
him
so
that
all
the
birds
of
the
old
orchard
had
driven
him
out
until
they
discovered
who
the
real
thief
was
sammy
had
never
forgotten
or
forgiven
that
sharp
mean
trick
and
now
he
was
getting
even
right
down
in
his
heart
he
didn
t
want
any
real
harm
to
come
to
chatterer
but
he
did
love
to
see
him
frightened
but
his
greatest
fun
was
in
matching
his
wits
against
those
of
chatterer
for
you
know
both
have
very
sharp
wits
as
scamps
are
very
apt
to
have
now
all
the
time
he
had
been
mumbling
and
finding
fault
with
the
corn
chatterer
had
brought
from
his
storehouse
in
the
hollow
rail
on
the
edge
of
the
cornfield
sammy
had
only
been
pretending
yes
sir
he
had
simply
been
pretending
you
see
he
had
thought
of
that
before
chatterer
had
and
had
thought
chatterer
very
stupid
not
to
have
remembered
it
in
the
first
place
now
that
chatterer
had
remembered
it
sammy
was
glad
although
he
pretended
not
to
be
why
was
he
glad
well
you
see
he
knew
that
chatterer
was
greatly
tickled
inside
because
he
thought
that
he
had
proved
himself
smarter
than
sammy
and
all
the
time
sammy
saw
another
chance
to
prove
to
chatterer
that
he
wasn
t
so
smart
as
he
thought
himself
when
he
left
chatterer
he
flew
straight
to
the
green
forest
and
from
there
to
the
edge
of
the
green
meadows
his
sharp
eyes
searched
the
green
meadows
until
they
saw
his
cousin
blacky
the
crow
sammy
flew
straight
over
to
where
blacky
was
sitting
for
a
few
minutes
they
talked
together
and
then
both
looked
over
to
a
tall
lone
tree
out
in
the
middle
of
the
green
meadows
in
the
top
of
which
sat
a
black
form
very
straight
and
very
still
in
fact
to
eyes
less
sharp
than
those
of
sammy
jay
and
blacky
the
crow
it
would
have
looked
very
much
like
a
part
of
the
tree
it
was
roughleg
the
hawk
watching
for
danny
meadow
mouse
illustration
sammy
flew
straight
over
to
where
blacky
was
sitting
will
you
do
it
asked
sammy
i
don
t
dare
to
myself
because
he
might
have
a
notion
that
a
fat
jay
like
me
would
make
him
a
good
dinner
of
course
i
ll
do
it
replied
blacky
old
roughleg
never
bothers
me
and
it
will
be
a
great
joke
all
right
replied
sammy
be
on
hand
where
you
can
see
what
happens
morning
and
with
that
sammy
jay
flew
back
to
the
green
forest
where
he
could
watch
in
a
few
minutes
blacky
the
crow
flew
over
near
the
tree
in
which
sat
roughleg
the
hawk
presently
sammy
heard
blacky
s
harsh
voice
caw
caw
caw
said
blacky
sammy
smiled
it
was
a
signal
and
he
knew
that
blacky
had
done
as
he
had
said
he
would
then
sammy
flew
off
to
look
for
some
new
mischief
with
which
to
amuse
himself
for
the
rest
of
the
day
has
a
dreadful
chatterer
was
feeling
quite
like
himself
his
saucy
impudent
self
as
he
peeped
out
of
his
doorway
at
daylight
he
felt
that
he
had
got
the
best
of
sammy
jay
the
day
before
to
be
sure
he
had
to
get
corn
for
sammy
but
he
did
not
have
to
go
to
farmer
brown
s
for
it
and
he
knew
that
it
was
the
fun
of
seeing
him
take
that
risk
that
sammy
wanted
more
than
he
did
the
corn
he
felt
that
he
had
been
smarter
than
sammy
and
the
feeling
made
him
quite
like
his
old
self
chickaro
and
chickaree
who
is
there
as
smart
as
me
chickaro
and
chickaree
sharper
wits
you
ll
never
see
now
that
was
boasting
and
boasting
is
one
of
the
most
foolish
habits
in
the
world
but
chatterer
always
was
a
boaster
and
probably
always
will
be
so
he
whisked
in
and
out
of
the
old
stone
wall
and
said
this
over
and
over
while
he
waited
for
sammy
jay
to
appear
he
had
not
gone
over
to
farmer
brown
s
this
morning
for
his
breakfast
because
he
felt
sure
that
sammy
would
come
and
send
him
for
corn
and
he
knew
that
he
would
have
to
go
but
he
meant
to
go
down
to
his
own
in
the
hollow
rail
on
the
edge
of
the
cornfield
and
he
could
eat
his
fill
there
so
he
scampered
about
and
wished
that
sammy
would
hurry
up
for
he
was
hungry
at
last
sammy
came
and
just
as
chatterer
expected
he
demanded
the
corn
that
chatterer
had
promised
to
get
for
him
whenever
he
should
ask
for
it
right
away
chatterer
started
for
the
cornfield
running
along
the
fences
he
always
did
like
to
run
along
fences
and
though
it
was
a
long
way
down
there
he
didn
t
mind
for
it
was
a
sharp
cold
morning
and
the
run
made
him
feel
fine
as
he
ran
he
kept
chuckling
to
himself
to
think
how
smart
he
had
been
to
think
of
that
and
a
way
to
keep
his
promise
to
sammy
jay
without
running
any
risk
to
himself
he
was
whisking
along
the
fence
on
the
edge
of
the
cornfield
and
had
almost
reached
the
hollow
rail
where
he
had
stored
the
corn
he
stopped
to
sit
up
on
a
and
boast
once
more
chickaro
and
chickaree
who
is
there
as
he
didn
t
finish
instead
his
tongue
seemed
to
stick
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
and
his
little
black
eyes
looked
as
if
they
would
pop
out
of
his
head
sitting
on
a
post
close
to
the
hollow
rail
was
a
straight
black
form
watching
him
with
cruel
eyes
it
was
roughleg
the
hawk
chatterer
gave
a
little
gasp
of
fright
he
whirled
around
and
started
back
along
the
fence
as
fast
as
he
could
make
his
legs
go
instantly
roughleg
spread
his
great
wings
and
sailed
after
him
chatterer
hadn
t
gone
the
length
of
two
rails
before
roughleg
was
over
him
with
his
great
cruel
claws
spread
wide
he
suddenly
swooped
down
chatterer
dodged
to
the
under
side
of
the
rail
just
in
time
the
very
nick
of
time
roughleg
screamed
with
disappointment
and
that
scream
had
such
a
fierce
sound
that
chatterer
shivered
all
over
illustration
chatterer
gave
a
little
gasp
of
fright
how
he
ever
got
back
to
the
old
orchard
he
hardly
knew
himself
ever
so
many
times
he
just
managed
to
dodge
those
great
claws
but
he
did
get
there
at
last
out
of
breath
and
tired
and
frightened
there
sat
sammy
jay
waiting
for
his
corn
he
pretended
to
be
very
angry
because
chatterer
had
none
and
threatened
to
go
straight
to
the
green
forest
and
tell
shadow
the
weasel
where
chatterer
was
living
there
was
nothing
for
chatterer
to
do
but
to
go
over
to
the
as
soon
as
he
had
rested
a
little
it
s
been
a
dreadful
day
a
perfectly
dreadful
day
said
chatterer
to
himself
as
he
curled
up
in
bed
for
the
night
i
wonder
how
old
roughleg
happened
to
be
sitting
on
that
this
morning
but
sammy
jay
didn
t
wonder
he
knew
hits
on
a
plan
at
each
time
that
chatterer
thought
himself
smarter
than
sammy
jay
he
found
that
he
wasn
t
as
smart
as
he
thought
he
was
and
this
always
made
him
feel
mortified
he
just
couldn
t
admit
even
to
himself
that
sammy
was
the
smartest
and
yet
here
he
was
every
day
bringing
corn
for
sammy
from
farmer
brown
s
whenever
sammy
told
him
to
and
running
the
risk
of
being
seen
by
farmer
brown
s
boy
all
because
he
hadn
t
been
able
to
think
of
some
way
to
outwit
sammy
once
more
after
he
had
such
a
narrow
escape
from
old
roughleg
the
hawk
he
had
tried
going
down
to
his
at
the
edge
of
the
cornfield
but
he
had
found
roughleg
on
watch
and
had
turned
back
from
the
way
sammy
jay
had
grinned
when
he
saw
chatterer
coming
back
chatterer
had
made
up
his
mind
that
sammy
knew
something
about
how
old
roughleg
happened
to
have
found
out
about
that
and
so
been
on
the
watch
now
all
this
time
sammy
jay
was
having
a
great
deal
of
fun
out
of
chatterer
s
trouble
each
time
that
chatterer
thought
of
a
plan
to
outwit
sammy
he
would
find
that
sammy
had
already
thought
of
it
and
a
way
to
make
the
plan
quite
useless
you
see
sammy
used
to
spend
a
great
deal
of
his
time
when
he
was
alone
in
the
green
forest
pretending
that
he
was
in
the
same
fix
as
chatterer
and
then
trying
to
think
of
some
way
out
of
it
so
it
was
that
chatterer
never
could
think
of
a
plan
that
sammy
hadn
t
already
thought
of
and
yet
there
was
a
way
to
cheat
sammy
out
of
his
fun
though
not
out
of
his
corn
and
it
really
was
the
fun
of
seeing
chatterer
so
worried
that
sammy
cared
most
about
sammy
had
thought
of
it
almost
at
once
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
chatterer
was
very
very
stupid
not
to
think
of
it
too
he
will
think
of
it
some
day
and
i
don
t
see
any
way
to
upset
such
a
simple
plan
said
sammy
to
himself
and
then
fell
to
studying
some
new
way
to
torment
chatterer
and
at
last
chatterer
did
think
of
it
it
was
such
a
simple
plan
probably
that
was
why
he
hadn
t
thought
of
it
before
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
go
over
to
farmer
brown
s
at
break
of
day
before
any
one
in
farmer
brown
s
house
was
awake
just
as
he
had
been
doing
only
make
two
or
three
trips
and
store
a
lot
of
corn
in
a
safe
hiding
place
in
the
old
stone
wall
then
when
sammy
jay
demanded
corn
he
could
get
it
without
trouble
or
danger
he
tried
it
and
it
worked
splendidly
sammy
jay
got
his
corn
but
he
didn
t
get
any
fun
and
he
cared
more
for
the
fun
of
seeing
chatterer
in
trouble
than
he
did
for
the
corn
so
after
two
or
three
mornings
sammy
didn
t
come
up
to
the
old
orchard
and
chatterer
chuckled
as
he
stored
up
the
corn
not
in
one
place
but
in
several
places
now
while
sammy
jay
seemed
to
have
grown
tired
of
corn
he
was
doing
a
lot
of
thinking
he
had
no
idea
of
leaving
chatterer
alone
he
had
just
got
to
think
of
some
way
of
upsetting
chatterer
s
simple
plan
it
was
reddy
fox
who
finally
gave
him
the
idea
he
saw
reddy
trotting
down
the
lone
little
path
through
the
green
forest
and
right
away
the
idea
came
to
him
he
would
tell
reddy
where
chatterer
was
storing
the
corn
in
the
old
stone
wall
and
reddy
would
hide
close
by
of
course
i
don
t
want
reddy
to
catch
chatterer
but
i
can
prevent
that
by
warning
him
just
in
time
but
he
will
be
so
frightened
that
he
won
t
dare
go
to
that
place
for
corn
again
in
a
hurry
and
so
will
have
to
go
to
the
for
it
thought
sammy
and
hurried
to
tell
reddy
fox
about
the
place
half
way
along
the
old
stone
wall
where
chatterer
had
hidden
his
corn
has
his
turn
to
sammy
jay
had
not
been
up
to
the
old
orchard
for
several
days
and
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
was
beginning
to
wonder
if
sammy
had
grown
tired
of
corn
but
chatterer
had
learned
that
it
is
always
best
to
be
prepared
and
so
every
morning
when
he
had
visited
farmer
brown
s
he
had
brought
a
generous
supply
back
to
the
old
orchard
and
hidden
it
in
several
secret
places
in
different
parts
of
the
stone
wall
and
some
in
a
certain
hollow
in
an
old
chatterer
couldn
t
quite
believe
that
sammy
had
given
up
all
hope
of
making
him
more
trouble
so
he
meant
to
be
prepared
so
when
sammy
did
appear
early
one
morning
chatterer
was
not
in
the
least
surprised
he
pretended
to
be
glad
to
see
sammy
in
fact
he
was
almost
glad
you
see
sammy
had
so
many
times
proved
his
wits
to
be
sharper
than
chatterer
s
that
chatterer
wanted
to
get
even
there
was
a
sparkle
of
mischief
in
sammy
s
eyes
chatterer
saw
it
right
away
and
he
guessed
that
sammy
had
some
new
plan
under
that
pert
cap
of
his
good
morning
sammy
jay
said
chatterer
pretending
to
be
polite
i
had
begun
to
think
that
you
were
tired
of
corn
i
have
some
very
nice
corn
ready
for
you
the
very
best
i
could
find
in
farmer
brown
s
will
you
have
some
this
morning
i
believe
i
will
replied
sammy
also
pretending
to
be
very
polite
it
is
very
nice
of
you
to
pick
out
the
best
corn
for
me
and
the
very
thought
of
it
makes
me
hungry
i
believe
i
would
like
some
this
very
minute
as
he
spoke
he
turned
his
head
to
hide
a
grin
for
thought
he
of
course
chatterer
will
go
straight
to
that
hiding
place
in
the
stone
wall
and
then
we
shall
see
some
fun
he
glanced
hastily
in
that
direction
and
he
saw
a
patch
of
red
half
hidden
behind
the
wall
and
he
knew
that
it
was
the
red
coat
of
reddy
fox
reddy
was
hiding
just
where
sammy
had
told
him
to
now
chatterer
had
been
doing
some
quick
thinking
he
remembered
the
sharp
tricks
sammy
had
played
on
him
before
and
he
didn
t
have
the
least
doubt
that
sammy
had
planned
another
of
course
he
expects
me
to
go
straight
to
that
place
where
he
knows
i
have
hidden
corn
for
him
and
if
he
has
planned
any
trouble
for
me
that
is
where
it
will
be
thought
chatterer
i
think
i
ll
get
the
corn
from
one
of
the
hiding
places
he
doesn
t
know
about
with
that
chatterer
ran
swiftly
out
along
a
branch
of
the
tree
he
was
in
leaped
across
to
another
tree
and
then
to
a
third
the
one
in
which
was
the
hollow
in
which
he
had
put
some
of
the
corn
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
back
with
his
cheeks
stuffed
full
sammy
jay
pretended
to
be
very
much
pleased
but
he
ate
it
as
if
he
had
lost
his
appetite
as
indeed
he
had
you
see
he
was
wondering
what
he
should
say
to
reddy
fox
to
whom
he
had
promised
a
chance
to
catch
chatterer
he
knew
that
reddy
would
think
that
it
was
all
one
of
sammy
s
tricks
so
without
waiting
to
finish
all
the
corn
sammy
politely
said
and
flew
away
to
the
deepest
part
of
the
green
forest
ha
ha
ha
ho
ho
ho
laughed
chatterer
as
his
sharp
eyes
spied
reddy
fox
trying
to
creep
away
without
being
seen
ha
ha
ha
ho
ho
ho
it
s
my
turn
to
laugh
ha
ha
ha
ho
ho
ho
and
so
for
the
time
being
chatterer
had
the
last
laugh
though
sammy
jay
knew
well
that
his
turn
would
come
again
if
only
he
were
patient
but
he
had
other
things
to
think
of
you
see
he
was
very
much
interested
in
the
adventures
of
buster
bear
