feel
a
desire
to
reveal
my
secret
to
someone
to
whom
my
first
recollection
is
as
follows
it
was
in
april
for
several
days
during
the
festivities
of
the
pentecost
juliana
and
i
and
our
two
little
daughters
maria
and
natalia
had
been
in
the
country
at
my
mother
s
house
a
roomy
old
place
known
as
the
badiola
it
was
the
seventh
year
of
our
marriage
three
years
had
already
slipped
by
since
another
pentecost
which
passed
in
that
villa
white
and
isolated
as
a
monastery
and
embalmed
with
tufts
of
violets
had
seemed
to
me
a
veritable
festival
of
pardon
peace
and
love
at
that
time
natalia
the
second
of
my
little
girls
barely
emerged
from
swaddling
clothes
like
a
flower
from
its
envelope
was
learning
to
walk
and
juliana
was
very
good
and
indulgent
with
me
although
there
was
a
shade
of
melancholy
in
her
smile
i
had
come
back
to
her
repentant
and
submissive
after
the
first
serious
infidelity
my
mother
who
knew
nothing
of
what
had
happened
had
tied
with
her
dear
hands
a
sprig
of
olive
at
the
head
of
our
bed
and
filled
the
little
silver
dish
hanging
on
the
wall
but
what
had
not
happened
in
three
years
between
juliana
and
myself
the
breach
was
henceforth
definitive
and
irreparable
i
had
gone
on
wronging
her
repeatedly
i
had
insulted
her
in
the
most
outrageous
manner
without
regard
for
her
feelings
without
restraint
carried
away
by
an
appetite
greedy
for
pleasure
by
the
vertigo
of
my
passions
by
the
curiosity
of
my
corrupted
mind
i
had
had
as
mistresses
two
of
her
intimate
friends
i
had
spent
several
weeks
at
florence
with
teresa
raffo
shamelessly
i
had
fought
with
the
false
count
raffo
a
duel
in
which
my
unfortunate
adversary
covered
himself
with
ridicule
owing
to
certain
bizarre
circumstances
and
nothing
of
all
this
had
remained
unknown
to
juliana
and
she
had
suffered
but
with
much
pride
and
almost
without
saying
anything
we
had
only
had
on
this
subject
a
few
very
short
interviews
at
which
i
did
not
tell
a
single
falsehood
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
sincerity
would
attenuate
my
fault
in
the
eyes
of
this
sweet
and
noble
woman
who
i
knew
had
a
superior
mind
i
knew
also
that
she
recognized
my
intellectual
superiority
and
that
she
excused
in
part
the
disorders
of
my
conduct
by
the
specious
theories
that
more
than
once
i
had
aired
in
her
presence
to
the
great
detriment
of
the
moral
doctrines
that
the
majority
of
men
profess
to
believe
in
the
conviction
that
she
would
not
judge
me
like
any
ordinary
man
lightened
my
conscience
of
the
weight
of
my
errors
she
too
understands
i
thought
that
since
i
am
different
from
others
since
i
have
a
different
conception
of
life
i
have
the
right
to
elude
the
duties
that
others
would
impose
on
me
i
have
the
right
to
despise
the
opinions
of
others
and
to
lead
with
absolute
sincerity
the
only
life
possible
to
my
higher
nature
i
had
the
conviction
of
being
not
only
a
higher
nature
but
also
a
rare
intelligence
and
i
believed
that
the
rarity
of
my
sensations
and
my
feelings
ennobled
distinguished
all
my
acts
proud
and
curious
of
this
rarity
of
mine
i
was
incapable
of
conceiving
the
slightest
sacrifice
the
slightest
abnegation
of
myself
i
was
incapable
of
renouncing
the
expression
the
manifestation
of
one
of
my
desires
but
at
the
bottom
of
all
my
subtilties
there
was
only
a
terrible
egotism
that
caused
me
to
neglect
my
duties
while
at
the
same
time
i
accepted
the
benefits
of
my
situation
insensibly
in
fact
from
one
abuse
to
another
i
had
succeeded
in
reconquering
my
liberty
even
with
juliana
s
consent
without
hypocrisy
without
subterfuge
without
degrading
lies
i
made
a
study
of
being
loyal
no
matter
at
what
cost
as
others
make
a
study
of
deception
at
all
times
i
strove
to
confirm
between
juliana
and
myself
the
new
pact
of
fraternal
affection
and
pure
friendship
she
was
to
be
my
sister
the
best
of
my
friends
my
sister
my
only
sister
constance
had
died
when
she
was
nine
years
old
leaving
in
my
heart
infinite
regret
i
often
thought
with
profound
melancholy
of
that
little
soul
who
had
not
been
able
to
offer
me
the
treasure
of
her
tenderness
a
treasure
that
i
dreamed
inexhaustible
among
all
human
affections
among
all
earthly
loves
that
of
a
sister
had
always
seemed
to
me
the
highest
and
the
most
consoling
i
often
thought
of
that
lost
great
consolation
and
the
irrevocableness
of
death
added
a
sort
of
mystery
to
my
pain
where
can
one
on
earth
find
another
sister
spontaneously
this
sentimental
aspiration
turned
towards
juliana
too
proud
to
accept
a
division
she
had
already
renounced
all
caresses
all
abandon
and
i
for
some
time
past
no
longer
felt
a
shade
of
sensual
disturbance
when
near
her
in
vain
i
felt
her
breath
on
my
cheek
respired
her
perfume
looked
at
the
little
brown
mole
on
her
neck
i
remained
absolutely
cold
it
seemed
impossible
to
me
that
this
was
the
same
woman
i
then
offered
to
become
a
brother
to
her
and
she
accepted
without
affectation
if
she
were
sad
i
myself
was
still
more
so
in
thinking
that
our
love
was
buried
forever
and
without
hope
of
resurrection
in
thinking
that
our
lips
doubtless
would
never
never
meet
again
and
in
the
blindness
of
my
egotism
it
seemed
to
me
that
at
heart
she
ought
to
be
grateful
to
me
for
this
sadness
which
i
felt
was
already
incurable
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
ought
to
be
pleased
at
it
and
find
a
consolation
in
it
as
if
with
a
reflection
of
our
past
love
there
had
been
a
time
when
we
both
dreamed
not
only
of
love
but
of
passion
until
ad
we
had
both
believed
in
our
more
than
once
during
our
moments
of
ecstasy
we
had
uttered
the
great
illusionary
words
never
we
had
ended
by
believing
in
the
affinity
of
our
flesh
in
that
affinity
so
rare
so
mysterious
which
binds
two
human
creatures
together
by
the
frightful
bond
of
insatiable
desire
we
believed
so
because
the
acuteness
of
our
sensations
had
not
diminished
even
after
by
the
creation
of
a
new
being
the
obscure
genius
of
the
species
had
attained
by
means
of
our
persons
his
unique
object
then
the
illusion
had
faded
away
the
flame
had
gone
out
my
swear
sincerely
wept
over
the
catastrophe
but
how
to
prevent
a
necessary
phenomenon
how
to
avoid
the
inevitable
it
was
therefore
very
fortunate
that
after
the
death
of
our
love
caused
by
the
fatal
necessity
of
the
phenomenon
and
consequently
by
the
fault
of
neither
of
us
we
were
able
to
go
on
living
in
the
same
house
bound
by
a
new
sentiment
which
was
perhaps
not
less
profound
than
the
old
one
and
which
assuredly
was
higher
and
more
singular
it
was
very
fortunate
that
a
new
illusion
could
replace
the
old
one
and
establish
between
our
souls
an
exchange
of
pure
affections
delicate
emotions
and
exquisite
sadness
but
in
reality
what
was
to
be
the
end
of
this
species
of
platonic
rhetoric
to
induce
the
victim
to
smilingly
consent
to
her
own
immolation
in
reality
our
new
existence
henceforth
fraternal
and
no
longer
conjugal
was
based
entirely
on
this
hypothesis
that
the
should
make
complete
abnegation
of
herself
i
myself
resumed
my
liberty
i
could
go
in
quest
of
those
new
sensations
which
my
nerves
needed
i
could
feel
passion
for
another
woman
devote
to
my
mistress
all
the
time
that
i
liked
live
away
from
home
a
strange
and
ardent
existence
and
then
return
find
there
again
the
who
was
awaiting
me
see
everywhere
in
my
rooms
visible
traces
of
her
care
on
my
table
a
vase
full
of
roses
that
her
hands
had
arranged
on
all
sides
order
refinement
and
the
radiant
cleanliness
of
a
place
in
which
lives
a
grace
was
not
that
an
enviable
condition
for
me
and
was
not
she
an
extraordinarily
precious
wife
who
would
consent
to
sacrifice
her
youth
to
me
and
who
considered
herself
well
recompensed
if
only
i
pressed
a
grateful
and
almost
religious
kiss
on
her
proud
and
gentle
brow
at
times
my
gratitude
became
so
warm
that
it
took
the
form
of
an
infinity
of
attentions
and
affectionate
greetings
i
possessed
the
art
of
being
the
best
of
brothers
when
i
was
absent
i
wrote
juliana
long
letters
full
of
melancholy
and
tenderness
which
were
often
posted
at
the
same
time
as
those
addressed
to
my
mistress
and
my
mistress
could
not
have
been
jealous
of
them
any
more
than
she
could
be
jealous
of
my
adoration
of
constance
s
memory
all
absorbed
as
i
was
by
the
intensity
of
my
peculiar
life
i
could
not
elude
the
problems
which
at
times
presented
themselves
to
my
mind
that
juliana
could
continue
her
sacrifice
with
such
marvellous
strength
she
must
love
me
with
a
sovereign
love
but
if
she
loved
me
and
could
be
only
my
she
must
without
any
possible
doubt
bear
in
her
soul
the
secret
of
a
mortal
despair
was
not
therefore
any
man
a
madman
who
without
remorse
immolated
to
other
loves
disturbed
and
chimerical
this
creature
who
smiled
so
sadly
and
was
so
gentle
and
brave
i
remember
and
i
am
surprised
now
at
my
perversity
at
that
time
i
remember
that
among
the
reasons
that
i
advanced
to
calm
myself
the
strongest
was
this
one
since
moral
greatness
results
from
the
violence
of
the
sorrows
over
which
one
triumphs
it
is
necessary
that
she
should
suffer
all
i
make
her
suffer
so
that
she
may
have
an
opportunity
to
display
her
heroism
but
one
day
i
noticed
that
she
was
also
suffering
in
her
health
i
perceived
that
her
pale
face
was
growing
still
whiter
and
at
times
took
on
livid
tints
more
than
once
i
noticed
on
her
face
the
contractions
of
suppressed
pain
more
than
once
in
my
presence
she
was
seized
with
an
irresistible
trembling
which
shook
her
entire
being
and
made
her
teeth
rattle
as
by
the
shiver
of
a
sudden
fever
one
evening
while
she
was
upstairs
i
heard
her
give
a
piercing
cry
i
ran
to
her
and
found
her
standing
upright
leaning
against
a
cupboard
convulsed
writhing
as
if
she
had
taken
poison
she
seized
my
hand
and
held
it
tight
as
in
a
vise
tullio
tullio
how
horrible
it
is
oh
how
horrible
it
is
she
looked
at
me
close
to
she
kept
fixed
upon
me
her
dilated
eyes
which
in
the
twilight
seemed
of
unusual
size
and
in
those
large
orbs
i
saw
pass
something
like
the
waves
of
some
mysterious
agony
that
persistent
intolerable
gaze
suddenly
filled
me
with
a
mad
terror
it
was
evening
twilight
and
the
window
was
open
and
the
swollen
curtains
shook
at
the
breath
of
the
wind
and
a
candle
was
burning
on
a
table
before
a
mirror
and
i
know
not
why
the
shaking
of
the
curtains
the
hopeless
flickering
of
the
tiny
flame
which
reflected
her
paleness
in
the
glass
assumed
in
my
mind
a
sinister
significance
and
increased
my
terror
the
idea
of
poison
flashed
across
my
mind
at
that
moment
she
could
not
repress
another
cry
and
beside
herself
by
the
excess
of
pain
she
threw
herself
upon
my
breast
distractedly
oh
tullio
tullio
help
me
help
me
paralyzed
with
terror
i
remained
for
a
moment
without
power
to
utter
a
word
without
power
to
make
a
movement
what
have
you
done
juliana
what
have
you
done
speak
speak
what
have
you
done
surprised
at
the
great
change
in
my
voice
she
drew
back
a
little
and
looked
at
me
my
face
must
have
been
whiter
and
more
upset
than
hers
for
she
replied
quickly
in
a
rambling
way
nothing
nothing
tullio
don
t
be
frightened
see
it
s
one
of
my
usual
spells
you
will
soon
be
t
be
alarmed
but
seized
by
the
terrible
suspicion
i
doubted
her
words
it
seemed
to
me
that
all
around
revealed
to
me
the
tragic
event
and
that
an
inner
voice
repeated
s
for
you
for
you
that
she
wanted
to
die
it
s
you
you
who
have
urged
her
on
towards
and
i
took
her
hands
and
i
felt
they
were
cold
and
i
saw
a
bead
of
sweat
running
down
her
brow
no
no
i
cried
you
re
deceiving
me
for
pity
s
sake
juliana
my
cherished
soul
speak
speak
tell
me
have
oh
for
pity
s
sake
tell
me
have
you
and
my
horrified
eyes
sought
all
around
on
the
furniture
on
the
carpet
everywhere
for
some
sign
then
she
understood
again
she
let
herself
fall
on
my
breast
and
shuddering
making
me
shudder
she
said
to
me
her
mouth
against
my
shoulder
never
never
shall
i
forget
that
indefinable
tone
she
said
to
me
no
no
no
tullio
no
ah
what
else
in
the
world
can
equal
the
vertiginous
acceleration
of
our
inner
life
we
remained
in
this
attitude
in
the
middle
of
the
room
silent
and
in
a
single
moment
the
inconceivable
immensity
of
a
universe
of
feelings
and
thoughts
surged
up
in
me
with
frightful
distinctness
if
it
were
true
demanded
the
voice
it
were
true
continual
starts
shook
juliana
against
my
still
kept
her
face
hidden
and
i
myself
knew
well
that
in
spite
of
the
sufferings
of
her
poor
flesh
she
thought
only
of
the
possibility
of
the
deed
i
had
thought
only
of
my
mad
terror
a
question
rose
to
my
lips
have
you
ever
been
then
another
is
there
a
possibility
of
your
giving
way
to
the
i
did
not
give
expression
to
either
of
them
and
yet
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
understood
from
then
on
we
were
both
under
the
empire
of
this
thought
of
death
this
picture
of
death
we
both
were
subjected
to
a
kind
of
tragic
exaltation
which
made
us
forget
the
moment
of
doubt
in
which
it
was
born
and
lose
consciousness
of
the
real
all
at
once
she
burst
into
sobs
and
her
tears
provoked
my
tears
we
mingled
our
tears
such
hot
tears
alas
which
yet
were
powerless
to
change
our
destiny
i
knew
later
that
for
several
months
already
she
had
been
tormented
with
complicated
internal
troubles
those
terrible
occult
maladies
which
in
the
woman
disturb
all
the
vital
functions
the
doctor
whom
i
consulted
gave
me
to
understand
that
another
pregnancy
might
be
fatal
to
her
this
grieved
me
and
nevertheless
relieved
me
from
two
sources
of
anxiety
i
was
convinced
that
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
juliana
s
decline
and
i
had
an
excuse
in
my
mother
s
eyes
for
our
separate
beds
and
all
the
other
changes
that
had
taken
place
in
our
domestic
life
about
that
time
my
mother
was
coming
to
rome
from
the
country
where
since
my
father
s
death
she
passed
the
greater
part
of
the
year
with
my
brother
federico
my
mother
was
very
fond
of
her
young
in
her
eyes
juliana
was
truly
the
ideal
wife
the
companion
of
whom
she
had
dreamed
for
her
son
she
did
not
believe
that
anywhere
in
the
world
there
was
a
more
beautiful
more
gentle
more
noble
woman
than
juliana
she
could
not
conceive
that
i
could
desire
other
women
abandon
myself
in
other
arms
sleep
upon
other
hearts
as
she
had
been
loved
for
twenty
years
by
a
man
always
with
the
same
devotion
with
the
same
fidelity
until
death
she
was
ignorant
of
the
lassitude
the
disgust
the
treachery
and
all
the
miseries
and
all
the
shames
that
the
conjugal
alcove
shelters
she
was
ignorant
of
the
wounds
that
i
had
inflicted
and
that
i
was
still
inflicting
on
this
dear
soul
which
did
not
deserve
them
deceived
by
juliana
s
generous
dissimulation
she
still
believed
in
our
felicity
how
it
would
have
grieved
her
had
she
known
the
truth
at
that
period
i
was
still
under
the
domination
of
teresa
raffo
whose
violent
and
empoisoned
charms
evoked
in
me
the
image
of
menippo
s
mistress
do
you
remember
what
appollonius
says
to
menippo
in
the
ravishing
poem
o
beautiful
young
man
thou
art
caressing
a
serpent
a
serpent
is
caressing
thee
chance
favored
me
the
death
of
an
aunt
compelled
teresa
to
leave
rome
and
to
remain
absent
some
time
i
was
then
able
by
unusual
assiduity
when
with
my
wife
to
fill
the
great
void
that
the
departure
of
the
biondissima
left
in
my
days
the
disturbance
which
had
taken
place
in
me
that
evening
had
not
yet
been
quieted
since
that
evening
there
floated
between
juliana
and
myself
something
new
indefinable
as
her
physical
suffering
increased
my
mother
and
i
were
able
not
without
great
difficulty
to
secure
her
consent
to
the
surgical
operation
necessitated
by
her
condition
after
the
operation
she
was
confined
to
her
bed
for
thirty
or
forty
days
and
compelled
to
take
the
greatest
precautions
during
her
convalescence
already
the
poor
invalid
s
nerves
were
extremely
weak
and
irritable
the
preparations
long
and
wearisome
exhausted
and
exasperated
her
so
much
that
more
than
once
she
tried
to
throw
herself
out
of
bed
to
revolt
to
escape
the
brutal
punishment
which
violated
her
humiliated
her
degraded
her
tell
me
she
said
to
me
one
day
with
bitterness
aren
t
you
disgusted
with
me
when
you
think
of
it
oh
how
horrible
it
is
and
she
made
a
gesture
of
repugnance
at
herself
frowned
then
was
silent
another
day
as
i
entered
her
room
she
cried
go
away
go
away
tullio
please
go
away
you
can
come
back
when
i
m
better
if
you
stay
here
you
ll
hate
me
i
m
odious
now
t
look
at
me
sobs
choked
her
the
same
day
a
few
hours
later
while
i
was
standing
by
her
bedside
in
silence
because
i
thought
she
was
about
to
doze
off
she
let
fall
these
obscure
words
pronounced
with
the
strange
tone
of
someone
speaking
in
his
sleep
yes
really
i
did
it
it
was
a
good
what
are
you
saying
juliana
she
did
not
reply
what
are
you
thinking
of
juliana
she
replied
only
by
a
contraction
of
her
mouth
which
was
meant
to
be
a
smile
i
believed
i
understood
and
a
tumultuous
wave
of
regret
tenderness
and
pity
assailed
me
i
would
have
given
everything
so
that
at
that
moment
she
could
have
read
in
my
soul
that
she
could
have
observed
there
in
its
plenitude
my
inexpressible
and
consequently
vain
emotion
forgive
me
forgive
me
tell
me
what
i
must
do
to
obtain
my
forgiveness
to
make
you
forget
all
the
pain
i
have
caused
you
i
will
come
back
to
you
i
will
be
entirely
yours
forever
it
is
you
you
alone
whom
i
have
truly
loved
you
are
the
only
love
of
my
life
my
soul
ceaselessly
turns
towards
you
and
seeks
you
and
regrets
you
i
swear
it
when
away
from
you
i
have
never
felt
sincere
joy
i
have
never
had
an
instant
of
complete
forgetfulness
never
never
i
swear
it
you
alone
of
all
the
women
in
the
world
are
the
living
expression
of
goodness
and
gentleness
you
are
the
best
and
the
sweetest
creature
that
i
have
ever
dreamed
of
you
are
the
unique
and
yet
i
have
offended
you
i
have
caused
you
to
suffer
i
have
made
you
think
of
death
as
a
desirable
thing
oh
you
will
pardon
me
but
can
never
forgive
myself
you
you
will
forget
but
i
i
shall
not
forget
i
shall
always
be
in
my
own
eyes
an
unworthy
being
and
the
devotion
of
all
my
life
will
not
seem
a
sufficient
reparation
henceforth
as
formerly
you
will
be
my
mistress
my
friend
my
sister
as
formerly
you
will
be
my
guardian
and
my
adviser
i
will
tell
you
everything
i
will
reveal
everything
to
you
you
will
be
my
soul
and
you
will
get
better
it
is
i
who
will
cure
you
you
will
see
how
tender
your
doctor
will
be
to
you
oh
you
already
know
his
tenderness
remember
remember
then
too
you
were
ill
and
you
wouldn
t
have
any
other
doctor
than
me
and
i
did
not
leave
your
bedside
night
or
day
and
you
used
to
say
juliana
always
always
and
you
had
tears
in
your
eyes
and
i
drank
them
trembling
saint
saint
remember
when
you
can
get
up
when
you
are
convalescent
we
ll
go
back
there
we
ll
return
to
the
lilacs
you
will
still
be
a
little
weak
but
you
ll
feel
so
well
and
i
i
shall
feel
once
more
my
gayety
and
i
will
make
you
smile
i
will
make
you
laugh
you
yourself
will
have
once
more
your
sweet
bursts
of
joy
that
rejuvenated
my
heart
you
will
have
once
more
your
exquisite
airs
and
you
ll
wear
once
more
on
your
shoulders
that
plait
of
hair
which
pleased
me
so
much
we
are
young
we
can
if
you
wish
it
reconquer
happiness
we
ll
ll
live
that
is
how
i
spoke
inwardly
but
the
words
did
not
issue
from
my
lips
it
was
in
vain
that
i
was
moved
and
that
my
eyes
became
moist
i
knew
that
my
emotion
was
temporary
that
these
promises
were
deceptive
i
knew
also
that
juliana
would
not
entertain
any
illusions
and
that
she
would
reply
by
that
feeble
and
distrustful
smile
which
at
other
times
i
had
already
noticed
on
her
lips
that
smile
meant
yes
i
know
you
are
good
and
you
would
like
to
spare
me
pain
but
you
are
not
master
of
yourself
you
can
not
resist
the
fatalities
that
control
you
why
should
i
blind
my
eyes
to
the
truth
that
day
i
said
nothing
and
the
days
that
followed
in
spite
of
the
frequent
return
of
the
same
confused
impulse
of
repentance
vague
intentions
and
dreams
i
did
not
dare
to
speak
to
come
back
to
her
you
must
abandon
those
things
you
delight
in
that
woman
who
corrupts
you
have
you
the
strength
to
do
it
i
replied
to
myself
who
knows
and
i
waited
from
day
to
day
for
the
strength
that
did
not
come
i
waited
from
day
to
day
for
some
event
without
knowing
what
that
could
determine
my
resolution
render
it
inevitable
my
mind
pictured
our
new
life
the
slow
reblossoming
of
our
legitimate
love
the
strange
savor
of
certain
sensations
renewed
we
ll
go
back
there
to
the
lilacs
to
the
house
where
still
linger
our
sweetest
memories
we
ll
be
there
alone
all
alone
because
maria
and
natalia
would
stay
with
my
mother
at
the
badiola
the
weather
would
be
mild
and
the
invalid
would
not
leave
the
support
of
my
arms
in
those
familiar
paths
where
each
of
our
footsteps
would
awaken
a
souvenir
at
certain
moments
her
pale
face
would
suddenly
be
covered
with
a
faint
flush
and
we
should
both
feel
a
little
timidity
in
each
other
s
presence
at
others
we
should
seem
preoccupied
at
others
we
should
avoid
each
other
s
gaze
why
finally
one
day
the
suggestion
of
the
spot
would
master
us
and
i
should
be
bold
enough
to
speak
to
her
of
the
early
days
do
you
remember
do
you
remember
and
little
by
little
we
should
both
feel
the
disturbance
grow
and
become
unbearable
we
should
both
at
the
same
time
clasp
each
other
in
a
wild
embrace
we
should
kiss
each
other
on
the
mouth
we
should
feel
about
to
faint
she
would
faint
yes
and
i
would
lift
her
in
my
arms
i
would
call
her
by
the
names
that
a
supreme
tenderness
would
suggest
to
me
her
eyes
would
reopen
all
the
veils
would
be
lifted
from
her
gaze
and
for
an
instant
her
very
soul
would
be
riveted
on
me
she
would
appear
to
me
transfigured
then
the
old
ardor
would
retake
possession
of
us
we
should
reënter
into
the
great
illusion
we
should
both
have
but
a
unique
and
incessant
thought
we
should
be
tormented
by
inexpressible
uneasiness
i
should
ask
her
my
voice
trembling
you
better
and
by
its
tone
she
would
understand
the
question
that
this
question
concealed
and
she
would
reply
without
succeeding
in
dissimulating
a
thrill
and
in
the
evening
when
we
left
each
other
and
each
retired
to
a
separate
chamber
we
should
feel
as
if
dying
of
anguish
but
one
morning
with
an
unexpected
glance
her
eyes
would
say
to
me
and
in
the
terror
of
this
divine
and
terrible
moment
she
would
take
some
childish
pretext
to
flee
from
me
she
would
say
to
me
us
go
out
let
us
go
we
would
go
out
on
a
grayish
cloudy
oppressive
afternoon
the
walk
would
tire
us
drops
of
rain
warm
as
tears
would
begin
to
fall
on
our
hands
and
faces
i
would
say
to
her
in
a
changed
voice
us
go
and
on
the
threshold
unexpectedly
i
would
seize
her
in
my
arms
i
would
feel
her
abandon
herself
almost
fainting
in
my
arms
i
would
carry
her
upstairs
without
perceiving
her
weight
it
is
so
long
long
ago
and
our
beings
under
the
shock
of
a
divine
and
terrible
sensation
never
experienced
before
never
before
imagined
would
be
utterly
exhausted
and
afterwards
she
would
appear
to
me
almost
as
if
she
were
dying
her
face
all
bathed
in
tears
as
white
as
her
pillow
ah
that
is
how
she
appeared
to
me
it
was
dying
that
i
saw
her
the
morning
when
the
doctors
put
her
to
sleep
with
chloroform
and
she
feeling
that
she
was
slowly
sinking
into
the
insensibility
of
death
tried
two
or
three
times
to
stretch
out
her
arms
to
me
tried
to
call
me
i
left
the
room
completely
overcome
for
two
long
hours
endless
hours
i
waited
exasperating
my
suffering
by
excessive
imagination
and
my
man
s
being
felt
a
pang
of
hopeless
pity
for
that
poor
creature
whom
the
surgeon
s
steel
was
violating
not
only
in
her
poor
flesh
but
in
the
most
sacred
recesses
of
her
soul
in
the
most
delicate
sentiment
that
a
woman
can
for
her
and
also
for
the
others
for
all
those
tormented
by
indefinite
aspirations
towards
the
idealities
of
love
abused
by
the
captious
dream
with
which
virile
desire
surrounds
them
insensibly
captivated
with
a
higher
life
but
so
weak
so
sickly
so
imperfect
irremediably
equal
to
the
females
of
the
beasts
by
the
laws
of
nature
which
impose
on
them
the
duties
of
the
species
afflict
them
with
horrible
maladies
leave
them
exposed
to
all
kinds
of
degeneration
and
then
shuddering
in
every
fibre
i
saw
in
them
i
saw
in
all
of
them
with
frightful
lucidity
the
original
wound
when
i
reëntered
juliana
s
room
she
was
still
under
the
influence
of
the
anæsthetic
unconscious
silent
still
like
a
dying
woman
my
mother
was
very
pale
and
very
much
excited
but
it
seemed
that
the
operation
was
a
success
the
doctors
appeared
pleased
the
assistant
surgeon
was
rolling
a
bandage
things
gradually
began
to
be
orderly
and
quiet
again
the
invalid
remained
a
long
time
unconscious
and
a
slight
fever
set
in
in
the
night
she
was
taken
with
spasms
laudanum
did
not
quiet
her
i
was
nearly
frantic
the
spectacle
of
these
horrible
sufferings
made
me
think
that
she
was
going
to
die
i
no
longer
know
either
what
i
said
or
what
i
did
i
suffered
with
her
the
following
day
the
condition
of
the
patient
improved
then
from
day
to
day
the
improvement
continued
her
strength
came
back
very
slowly
i
did
not
quit
her
bedside
i
showed
a
kind
of
ostentation
in
recalling
to
her
by
my
acts
the
nurse
of
the
old
days
but
my
actual
feeling
was
very
different
it
was
not
always
the
feeling
of
a
only
it
often
happened
to
me
that
my
mind
was
preoccupied
with
a
phrase
written
by
my
mistress
at
the
very
moment
that
i
was
reading
to
her
some
chapter
from
one
of
her
favorite
books
i
did
not
succeed
in
forgetting
the
absent
nevertheless
when
in
replying
to
a
letter
i
felt
myself
a
little
distracted
and
almost
bored
during
those
strange
respites
that
are
still
left
to
us
by
a
strong
passion
the
object
of
which
is
far
from
us
i
thought
i
recognized
by
this
sign
that
i
no
longer
loved
and
i
repeated
to
myself
who
knows
one
day
in
my
presence
my
mother
said
to
juliana
when
you
are
up
when
you
can
walk
we
ll
all
go
together
to
the
badiola
won
t
we
tullio
juliana
looked
at
me
yes
mother
i
replied
without
hesitation
without
reflection
but
first
juliana
and
i
will
go
to
the
lilacs
and
she
looked
at
me
again
and
she
smiled
an
unexpected
indescribable
smile
with
an
almost
infantile
expression
of
credulity
it
looked
like
the
smile
of
a
sick
baby
to
whom
has
been
made
a
great
promise
which
it
did
not
hope
for
and
she
lowered
her
eyelids
but
she
continued
to
smile
and
her
eyes
seemed
to
contemplate
something
far
away
very
far
and
the
smile
faded
away
faded
away
without
disappearing
how
she
pleased
me
then
how
i
adored
her
at
that
moment
how
i
felt
that
nothing
in
the
world
equals
the
simple
emotion
of
kindness
infinite
kindness
emanated
from
this
creature
penetrated
all
my
being
filled
my
heart
she
was
lying
on
the
bed
supported
by
two
or
three
pillows
her
face
amid
the
mass
of
untied
brown
hair
seemed
of
extraordinarily
delicate
mould
a
sort
of
visible
immateriality
she
had
on
a
tightly
closed
at
the
neck
tight
around
the
wrists
and
her
hands
rested
flat
on
the
counterpane
so
pale
that
they
were
only
distinguishable
from
the
linen
by
the
blue
of
their
veins
i
took
one
of
these
hands
my
mother
had
just
left
the
room
and
i
said
in
a
low
tone
so
we
ll
return
the
lilacs
yes
replied
the
invalid
and
we
became
silent
to
prolong
our
emotion
to
preserve
our
illusion
we
both
knew
the
profound
meaning
concealed
under
these
few
whispered
words
a
sagacious
instinct
warned
us
not
to
insist
not
to
define
anything
not
to
go
too
far
if
we
had
said
a
word
more
we
should
have
found
ourselves
face
to
face
with
the
exclusive
realities
of
the
illusion
on
which
our
souls
existed
and
in
which
imperceptibly
they
lost
themselves
with
rapturous
dreams
one
were
almost
always
were
reading
stopping
every
now
and
then
bent
together
over
the
same
page
and
following
the
same
lines
with
our
eyes
it
was
a
volume
of
poetry
and
we
were
giving
to
the
verses
an
intensity
of
meaning
which
they
did
not
possess
silent
ourselves
we
spoke
to
each
other
by
the
mouth
of
the
poet
i
myself
marked
with
my
nail
the
lines
which
seemed
to
interpret
to
my
thoughts
je
veux
guidé
par
vous
beaux
yeux
aux
flammes
douces
par
toi
conduit
ô
main
où
tremblera
ma
main
marcher
droit
que
ce
soit
par
des
sentiers
de
mousses
ou
que
rocs
et
cailloux
encombrent
le
chemin
oui
je
veux
marcher
droit
et
calme
dans
la
vie
and
she
after
reading
sank
back
for
an
instant
on
her
pillows
her
eyes
closed
and
with
an
almost
imperceptible
smile
on
her
lips
pointed
to
the
passage
toi
la
bonté
toi
le
sourire
n
pas
le
conseil
aussi
le
bon
conseil
loyal
et
brave
but
on
her
breast
i
saw
the
batiste
follow
the
rhythm
of
respiration
with
an
easy
grace
which
began
to
disturb
as
also
the
feeble
perfume
of
iris
which
was
exhaled
by
bedclothes
and
pillows
i
hoped
and
i
expected
that
seized
by
a
sudden
languor
she
would
put
her
arm
around
my
neck
and
put
her
cheek
to
mine
so
close
that
i
could
feel
myself
touched
by
the
corner
of
her
mouth
she
laid
her
slender
thumb
on
the
book
and
with
her
nail
made
a
mark
on
the
margin
guiding
my
emotion
la
voix
vous
fut
connue
et
chère
mais
à
present
elle
est
voilée
comme
une
veuve
désolée
elle
dit
la
voix
reconnue
que
la
bonté
c
est
notre
vie
elle
parle
aussi
de
la
gloire
d
être
simple
sans
plus
attendre
et
de
noces
d
or
et
du
tendre
bonheur
d
une
paix
sans
victoire
acceuillez
la
voix
qui
persiste
dans
son
naïf
épithalame
allez
rien
n
est
meilleur
à
l
âme
que
de
faire
une
âme
moins
triste
i
seized
her
wrist
and
slowly
i
lowered
my
head
until
i
touched
with
my
lips
the
hollow
of
her
hand
and
i
murmured
could
she
closed
my
mouth
and
uttered
her
great
word
silence
at
that
moment
my
mother
came
in
to
announce
the
visit
of
signora
talice
i
noticed
juliana
s
impatient
little
gesture
and
i
felt
irritated
myself
against
the
importunate
visitor
juliana
sighed
oh
dio
tell
her
that
juliana
is
sleeping
i
suggested
to
my
mother
in
an
almost
supplicating
tone
she
made
me
a
sign
that
the
visitor
was
waiting
in
the
adjoining
room
we
must
see
her
this
signora
talice
was
a
spiteful
and
fastidious
gossip
every
few
moments
she
glanced
at
me
with
curiosity
in
the
course
of
conversation
my
mother
happened
to
say
that
i
had
sat
with
the
invalid
all
day
almost
without
interruption
and
signora
talice
looking
fixedly
at
me
said
in
a
tone
of
manifest
irony
what
an
ideal
husband
she
finally
irritated
me
so
that
i
found
a
pretext
to
leave
the
room
i
left
the
house
on
the
steps
i
met
maria
and
natalia
coming
in
with
their
governess
as
usual
they
assailed
me
with
an
infinity
of
caresses
and
maria
the
elder
handed
me
several
letters
that
the
janitor
had
given
her
among
them
i
suddenly
recognized
the
letter
of
the
absent
and
then
i
escaped
from
their
caresses
with
a
sort
of
impatience
as
soon
as
i
was
in
the
street
i
stopped
to
read
it
was
a
short
letter
but
full
of
passion
with
two
or
three
of
those
singularly
incisive
phrases
that
teresa
knew
how
to
write
when
she
wished
to
disturb
me
she
announced
her
return
to
florence
on
the
twentieth
to
the
of
that
month
and
said
she
hoped
to
meet
me
as
before
she
promised
to
furnish
me
with
more
precise
particulars
concerning
the
rendezvous
in
a
second
all
the
phantoms
of
the
recent
illusions
and
emotions
became
detached
from
my
mind
like
the
flowers
of
a
tree
shaken
by
a
gust
of
wind
and
as
the
fallen
flowers
are
forever
lost
to
the
tree
so
these
things
of
the
soul
were
lost
to
me
they
became
foreign
to
my
being
i
made
an
effort
i
tried
to
regain
possession
of
myself
i
did
not
succeed
i
began
to
walk
through
the
streets
aimlessly
i
entered
the
shop
of
a
confectioner
i
entered
a
i
bought
bonbons
and
books
mechanically
twilight
fell
the
street
lamps
were
lighted
the
pavements
were
crowded
two
or
three
ladies
bowed
to
me
from
their
carriages
one
of
my
friends
passed
quickly
laughing
and
talking
with
his
mistress
who
held
a
bunch
of
roses
in
her
hand
the
maleficent
breath
of
fashionable
life
penetrated
me
awakened
my
curiosity
my
desires
my
jealousies
my
blood
seemed
suddenly
aflame
certain
images
extraordinarily
distinct
passed
before
my
mind
like
a
lightning
flash
the
absent
regained
possession
of
me
merely
by
certain
expressions
of
her
letter
and
all
my
desires
went
out
towards
her
madly
but
when
the
first
tumult
was
appeased
while
i
was
the
steps
of
my
house
i
understood
the
gravity
of
what
had
taken
place
of
what
i
had
done
i
understood
that
a
few
hours
before
i
had
effectively
tightened
the
bond
i
had
pledged
my
faith
i
had
given
a
promise
a
tacit
but
solemn
promise
to
a
creature
still
weak
and
ill
i
could
not
break
my
word
without
infamy
and
i
was
conscious
of
it
then
i
was
sorry
i
had
not
mistrusted
this
deceitful
compassion
i
was
sorry
i
had
dwelt
too
long
on
this
sentimental
languor
and
i
examined
minutely
my
acts
my
words
of
that
day
with
the
cold
subtilty
of
a
dishonest
tradesman
who
seeks
a
quarrel
in
order
to
avoid
the
obligations
of
a
contract
he
has
made
my
last
words
had
been
too
serious
that
could
you
forget
pronounced
in
that
tone
after
the
reading
of
those
verses
had
had
the
value
of
a
definite
understanding
and
that
silence
of
juliana
had
been
the
seal
of
the
contract
but
i
thought
was
she
really
convinced
this
time
of
my
repentance
has
she
not
always
been
a
little
sceptical
concerning
my
good
impulses
and
i
saw
once
more
that
weak
and
unbelieving
smile
that
on
former
occasions
i
had
already
noticed
on
her
lips
if
in
the
secret
recesses
of
her
heart
she
had
not
believed
or
again
if
her
illusion
had
suddenly
faded
away
then
perhaps
my
retraction
would
be
less
serious
would
not
greatly
wound
her
or
offend
her
there
would
merely
have
been
an
episode
without
consequence
and
i
should
resume
my
former
liberty
the
lilacs
would
still
be
a
dream
to
her
but
then
i
saw
the
other
smile
that
new
unexpected
credulous
smile
which
had
appeared
on
her
lips
at
the
mention
of
the
lilacs
what
could
i
do
what
should
i
decide
what
attitude
should
i
take
teresa
raffo
s
letter
had
the
same
effect
on
me
as
a
severe
burn
when
i
reëntered
juliana
s
room
i
noticed
at
once
that
was
waiting
for
she
seemed
pleased
her
eyes
shone
brilliantly
her
cheeks
had
more
color
wherever
have
you
been
she
asked
laughing
signora
talice
drove
me
away
i
replied
she
laughed
again
a
limpid
and
young
laugh
which
transfigured
her
i
held
out
to
her
the
books
and
the
box
of
sweetmeats
for
me
she
cried
joyously
like
a
greedy
child
and
she
hastened
to
open
the
box
with
graceful
little
gestures
which
aroused
in
my
mind
fragments
of
distant
memories
for
me
she
took
a
bonbon
made
a
motion
as
if
about
to
carry
it
to
her
mouth
hesitated
a
little
let
it
fall
back
thrust
aside
the
box
and
said
later
you
know
tullio
explained
my
mother
she
s
not
eaten
anything
yet
she
wanted
to
wait
for
you
oh
i
haven
t
told
you
yet
interrupted
juliana
her
face
flushing
i
haven
t
told
you
yet
that
the
doctor
came
during
your
absence
he
said
i
am
much
better
i
may
get
up
on
thursday
you
understand
tullio
i
may
get
up
on
thursday
then
she
added
in
ten
or
fifteen
days
at
the
most
i
shall
even
be
able
to
undertake
a
journey
after
a
moment
s
reverie
she
added
in
a
lower
tone
the
lilacs
so
that
had
been
the
unique
object
of
her
thoughts
the
unique
object
of
her
dreams
she
believed
she
i
had
difficulty
in
dissimulating
my
anguish
i
busied
myself
perhaps
with
excessive
eagerness
with
the
preparations
for
her
little
dinner
it
was
i
who
put
the
portable
table
on
her
knees
she
followed
all
my
movements
with
a
caressing
look
that
pained
me
ah
if
she
could
guess
all
at
once
my
mother
exclaimed
naïvely
how
beautiful
you
are
juliana
in
fact
an
extraordinary
animation
lit
up
her
features
brightened
her
eyes
completely
rejuvenated
her
my
mother
s
exclamation
made
her
blush
and
during
the
whole
evening
her
cheeks
preserved
a
reflection
of
that
redness
she
repeated
on
thursday
i
will
get
up
three
days
i
shan
t
know
how
to
walk
any
she
spoke
persistently
of
her
recovery
of
our
approaching
departure
she
asked
my
mother
for
news
of
the
villa
of
the
garden
i
planted
a
willow
branch
near
the
basin
the
last
time
i
was
there
do
you
remember
tullio
who
knows
if
we
shall
find
it
yes
replied
my
mother
beaming
yes
you
will
find
it
again
it
has
grown
since
then
it
is
a
tree
now
ask
federico
really
really
tell
me
it
seemed
as
if
at
that
moment
this
trifling
detail
had
incalculable
importance
in
her
eyes
she
began
to
prattle
and
i
was
astonished
that
she
could
venture
so
far
into
the
illusion
i
wondered
at
the
transfiguration
that
was
the
result
of
her
dream
why
this
time
she
how
comes
it
that
she
permits
herself
this
transport
what
gives
her
this
unusual
confidence
and
the
thought
of
my
approaching
infamy
inevitable
perhaps
froze
the
blood
in
my
veins
why
inevitable
shall
i
never
be
able
to
free
myself
then
must
i
keep
my
promise
my
mother
was
a
witness
of
my
promise
i
will
keep
it
at
any
cost
and
with
an
inward
effort
i
might
say
with
an
upheaval
of
my
conscience
i
emerged
from
the
tumult
of
my
uncertainties
and
i
went
back
to
juliana
by
a
sudden
conversion
of
my
soul
i
found
her
as
charming
as
ever
full
of
animation
life
and
youth
she
reminded
me
of
the
juliana
of
former
juliana
who
so
often
amidst
the
calm
of
domestic
life
i
had
suddenly
taken
in
my
arms
as
if
in
a
sudden
frenzy
no
no
mother
do
not
make
me
drink
any
more
she
pleaded
staying
the
hand
of
my
mother
who
was
pouring
out
some
wine
for
her
i
have
already
drunk
too
much
without
noticing
it
what
delicious
chablis
it
is
do
you
remember
tullio
she
laughed
looking
straight
at
me
as
she
recalled
the
love
memories
over
which
floated
the
delicate
vapor
of
that
pale
slightly
bitter
wine
her
favorite
beverage
yes
i
remember
i
replied
she
her
eyes
with
a
slight
trembling
of
the
lashes
then
she
said
it
s
warm
isn
t
it
my
ears
are
burning
she
took
her
head
between
her
hands
to
feel
how
hot
it
was
the
lamp
placed
near
the
bed
threw
a
bright
light
on
her
long
profile
causing
to
glitter
the
few
golden
threads
in
the
depths
of
her
hair
where
the
delicate
and
tiny
ear
peeped
out
while
i
helped
to
clear
the
table
my
mother
and
the
servant
had
gone
out
for
a
moment
and
were
in
an
adjoining
room
she
called
me
in
a
low
voice
tullio
and
drawing
me
furtively
to
her
she
kissed
my
cheek
did
she
not
mean
by
this
kiss
to
reclaim
me
entirely
body
and
soul
forever
did
not
such
an
act
coming
from
her
so
reserved
and
proud
signify
that
she
wished
to
forget
all
that
she
had
already
forgotten
all
so
as
to
live
once
more
a
new
life
with
me
how
could
she
have
yielded
to
my
love
with
more
grace
with
greater
confidence
in
an
instant
the
sister
became
once
more
the
lover
the
impeccable
sister
had
retained
in
her
blood
and
in
the
depths
of
her
veins
the
memory
of
my
caresses
the
organic
recollection
of
sensations
so
vivid
and
tenacious
in
women
in
thinking
of
it
again
when
i
found
myself
alone
i
had
a
fleeting
vision
of
distant
days
of
evenings
long
gone
by
a
june
twilight
warm
and
roseate
in
which
floated
mysterious
perfumes
dangerous
to
the
solitary
to
those
who
regret
or
those
who
desire
i
enter
the
room
she
is
seated
near
the
window
with
a
book
on
her
knees
very
very
pale
in
the
attitude
of
one
about
to
faint
juliana
she
shudders
and
recovers
herself
what
are
you
doing
nothing
she
answers
but
an
indefinable
change
as
if
she
were
undergoing
an
inward
struggle
to
repress
something
passed
in
her
black
eyes
how
many
times
had
her
poor
flesh
been
compelled
to
suffer
these
tortures
since
the
day
of
the
sad
renouncement
my
mind
dwelt
upon
the
images
raised
by
the
recent
trifling
incident
the
singular
excitement
displayed
by
juliana
reminded
me
again
of
divers
exhibitions
of
her
physical
and
extraordinarily
acute
sensibility
perhaps
the
malady
had
increased
had
provoked
this
sensibility
and
i
curious
and
perverse
thought
i
should
be
able
to
see
the
fragile
life
of
the
convalescent
inflame
and
dissolve
under
my
caresses
i
thought
too
that
this
voluptuousness
would
have
as
it
were
a
flavor
of
sin
if
she
died
from
it
i
thought
certain
words
of
the
surgeon
recurred
to
me
in
a
sinister
way
and
because
of
the
cruelty
that
is
at
the
heart
of
every
sensual
man
the
peril
instead
of
frightening
me
attracted
me
i
lingered
over
this
examination
of
my
feelings
with
that
species
of
bitter
complaisance
mixed
with
disgust
that
i
brought
to
bear
upon
the
analysis
of
all
the
inner
manifestations
in
which
i
believed
i
discovered
a
proof
of
the
natural
wickedness
of
man
why
does
human
nature
possess
that
horrible
faculty
of
feeling
acute
pleasure
when
one
knows
one
is
harming
the
creature
who
gives
the
pleasure
why
is
the
germ
of
this
execrable
sadic
perversion
to
be
found
in
every
man
who
loves
and
desires
it
was
these
unhealthy
reflections
rather
than
the
first
instinctive
impulse
of
kindness
and
pity
that
strengthened
during
the
night
my
plans
in
favor
of
the
abused
even
from
a
distance
the
absent
still
empoisoned
me
to
conquer
the
resistance
of
my
egotism
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
oppose
to
the
thought
of
the
delicious
depravity
of
that
woman
the
image
of
a
new
depravity
very
choice
that
i
promised
myself
to
cultivate
at
leisure
in
the
virtuous
security
of
my
own
house
then
with
the
alchemistic
talent
that
i
possessed
for
combining
the
several
products
of
my
mind
i
analyzed
the
series
of
the
characteristic
states
of
soul
determined
in
me
by
juliana
at
the
various
epochs
of
our
common
existence
and
i
drew
from
it
certain
elements
that
i
used
in
the
construction
of
a
new
artificial
state
singularly
appropriate
for
increasing
the
intensity
of
the
sensations
that
i
wished
to
experience
thus
for
instance
with
the
object
of
rendering
still
more
acute
the
savor
of
the
sin
that
attracted
me
and
exalted
my
wicked
phantasy
i
sought
to
picture
to
myself
the
moments
in
which
i
had
most
deeply
expressed
the
fraternal
feeling
the
moments
in
which
juliana
had
seemed
most
like
a
sister
and
he
who
dwelt
on
these
wretched
maniacal
subtleties
was
the
man
who
a
few
hours
before
had
felt
his
heart
palpitate
with
a
simple
emotion
of
kindness
at
the
glimmer
of
an
unexpected
smile
these
contradictory
crises
made
up
his
illogical
fragmentary
incoherent
life
there
were
in
him
all
kinds
of
tendencies
the
possibility
of
every
opposite
and
between
these
opposites
an
infinity
of
intermediary
degrees
and
between
these
tendencies
an
infinity
of
combinations
according
to
the
weather
and
according
to
the
place
according
to
the
accidental
shock
of
circumstances
of
an
insignificant
fact
of
a
word
according
to
the
inner
influences
even
still
more
obscure
the
permanent
basis
of
his
being
assumed
the
most
changing
the
most
fugitive
the
strangest
aspects
in
him
a
special
organic
condition
corresponded
to
every
special
tendency
while
strengthening
it
and
this
tendency
became
a
centre
of
attraction
toward
which
converged
all
the
conditions
and
tendencies
directly
associated
and
the
association
spread
further
and
further
then
his
centre
of
gravity
was
displaced
his
personality
was
changed
to
another
personality
silent
floods
of
blood
and
ideas
caused
to
blossom
on
the
permanent
basis
of
his
being
either
gradually
or
all
at
once
new
souls
he
became
i
insist
on
this
episode
because
really
it
marks
the
decisive
point
the
following
morning
on
awakening
i
retained
only
a
confused
notion
of
all
that
had
happened
cowardice
and
anguish
seized
upon
me
again
just
as
soon
as
i
had
before
my
eyes
a
second
letter
from
teresa
raffo
who
decided
upon
the
for
our
meeting
at
florence
and
gave
me
precise
instructions
the
was
a
sunday
and
on
thursday
the
juliana
rose
for
the
first
time
i
argued
for
a
long
time
with
myself
all
the
possibilities
and
arguing
i
began
to
compromise
there
is
certainly
no
doubt
about
it
the
rupture
is
necessary
inevitable
but
how
to
break
off
under
what
pretext
can
i
announce
my
decision
to
teresa
in
a
mere
letter
my
last
letter
to
her
was
still
warm
with
passion
filled
with
longing
how
can
i
justify
the
sudden
change
does
the
poor
woman
deserve
so
unexpected
and
brutal
a
blow
she
has
loved
me
much
she
loves
me
still
and
there
was
a
time
when
she
braved
dangers
for
my
sake
and
i
too
have
loved
her
i
still
love
her
our
passion
powerful
and
strange
is
known
she
is
envied
and
she
is
also
watched
how
many
men
aspire
to
take
my
place
too
numerous
to
count
in
making
a
rapid
review
of
my
most
redoubtable
rivals
of
my
most
probable
successors
i
pictured
to
myself
their
forms
is
there
in
rome
a
woman
more
blonde
more
fascinating
more
desirable
than
she
the
same
sudden
fire
that
had
heated
my
blood
the
evening
before
gushed
through
every
vein
and
the
idea
of
voluntarily
renouncing
her
seemed
to
me
absurd
inadmissible
no
no
i
shall
never
have
the
courage
i
never
will
and
never
can
this
tumult
calmed
i
followed
my
useless
debate
at
the
same
time
retaining
the
conviction
in
the
depths
of
my
being
that
when
the
hour
came
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
not
to
go
yet
i
had
the
courage
when
i
quitted
juliana
s
room
still
vibrating
with
emotion
i
had
the
supreme
courage
to
write
to
her
who
claimed
me
i
will
not
come
i
invented
a
pretext
and
i
remember
clearly
a
kind
of
instinct
made
me
choose
one
that
would
not
appear
very
important
to
her
so
you
hope
that
she
will
pay
no
attention
to
the
pretext
and
will
command
you
to
go
asked
an
inner
voice
i
found
myself
without
an
answer
to
this
sarcasm
and
an
irritation
an
atrocious
anxiety
took
possession
of
me
and
gave
me
no
more
peace
i
made
efforts
to
dissimulate
in
the
presence
of
juliana
and
my
mother
i
carefully
avoided
being
left
alone
with
the
poor
abused
one
each
moment
i
thought
i
read
in
her
gentle
humid
eyes
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
i
thought
i
saw
a
cloud
pass
over
her
pure
brow
on
wednesday
i
received
an
imperious
and
threatening
telegram
did
i
not
rather
expect
it
either
you
will
come
or
you
will
never
see
me
again
answer
i
answered
i
will
come
as
soon
as
i
had
done
it
under
the
impulse
of
that
species
of
unconscious
superexcitation
that
in
life
accompanies
every
decisive
act
i
found
myself
singularly
solaced
by
the
view
of
the
determined
turn
that
events
had
taken
the
feeling
of
my
own
irresponsibility
of
the
necessity
of
what
had
occurred
and
what
was
about
to
happen
became
very
profound
if
though
knowing
all
the
evil
that
i
do
though
condemning
myself
i
can
not
act
in
any
other
manner
it
is
a
sign
that
i
obey
an
unknown
superior
power
i
am
the
victim
of
a
cruel
ironical
irresistible
destiny
nevertheless
i
had
scarcely
put
foot
on
the
threshold
of
juliana
s
room
when
i
felt
the
pressure
on
my
heart
of
an
enormous
weight
and
i
stopped
swaying
between
the
portières
that
hid
me
a
look
will
suffice
her
to
divine
all
i
thought
desperate
and
i
was
on
the
point
of
turning
back
but
in
a
voice
that
had
never
before
seemed
so
gentle
to
me
she
said
is
it
you
tullio
then
i
advanced
a
step
she
exclaimed
on
seeing
me
what
ails
you
are
you
not
well
a
dizziness
it
is
already
gone
i
answered
and
i
felt
reassured
on
thinking
she
has
not
guessed
in
fact
she
had
not
the
slightest
suspicion
and
it
seemed
to
me
strange
that
it
should
be
so
should
i
prepare
her
for
the
brutal
blow
should
i
speak
frankly
or
concoct
some
falsehood
out
of
pity
for
her
or
would
it
not
be
better
to
go
away
unexpectedly
without
letting
her
know
and
leave
a
letter
for
her
containing
my
confession
what
was
the
best
way
of
rendering
my
effort
less
painful
of
making
her
surprise
less
cruel
alas
in
this
difficult
debate
a
grievous
instinct
inclined
me
to
consider
my
own
comfort
more
than
hers
and
without
the
least
doubt
i
should
have
chosen
the
method
of
the
sudden
departure
and
the
explanatory
letter
if
i
had
not
been
prevented
from
doing
so
out
of
regard
for
my
mother
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
spare
my
mother
always
at
any
cost
this
time
too
i
could
not
rid
myself
of
the
inner
sarcasm
at
cost
what
generosity
but
it
is
very
easy
for
you
to
return
to
the
old
conventions
and
further
very
safe
this
time
also
if
you
exact
it
the
victim
will
endeavor
to
smile
while
she
feels
she
is
dying
count
on
her
therefore
and
do
not
concern
yourself
about
the
rest
o
generous
heart
at
times
truly
man
finds
a
singular
joy
in
feeling
a
sincere
and
supreme
contempt
for
himself
what
are
you
thinking
of
tullio
juliana
inquired
of
me
with
a
naïve
gesture
touching
me
between
the
eyebrows
with
the
tip
of
her
finger
as
if
to
arrest
my
thought
i
took
her
hand
without
replying
and
my
very
silence
that
appeared
grave
to
me
sufficed
to
modify
anew
the
condition
of
my
mind
there
was
so
much
gentleness
in
the
voice
in
the
gesture
of
the
poor
deluded
woman
that
i
became
tender
and
felt
arise
the
enervating
emotion
that
causes
tears
to
flow
and
which
is
called
for
one
s
i
felt
a
keen
desire
to
be
pitied
at
the
same
time
an
inner
voice
whispered
profit
by
this
disposition
of
your
soul
but
for
the
time
being
reveal
nothing
by
slightly
exaggerating
you
will
succeed
in
weeping
without
difficulty
you
well
know
the
prodigious
effect
on
a
woman
of
the
tears
of
a
man
whom
she
loves
juliana
will
be
distracted
by
them
and
you
yourself
will
seem
to
be
crushed
by
some
terrible
grief
then
when
you
tell
her
the
truth
the
recollection
of
your
tears
will
raise
you
in
her
regard
she
may
think
this
is
then
the
reason
why
he
wept
yesterday
poor
fellow
and
it
will
be
to
your
advantage
not
to
be
taken
for
an
odious
egotist
on
the
contrary
people
will
think
that
you
have
vainly
fought
with
all
your
might
against
the
evil
influences
that
have
possession
of
you
and
that
you
are
afflicted
with
some
incurable
malady
that
you
bear
in
your
bosom
a
broken
heart
profit
therefore
by
the
opportunity
have
you
anything
on
your
conscience
asked
juliana
in
a
low
caressing
voice
full
of
confidence
i
bent
my
head
and
assuredly
was
affected
but
the
preoccupation
of
these
tears
caused
a
diversion
in
my
feelings
by
interrupting
the
spontaneity
and
in
consequence
retarded
the
physiological
phenomena
of
tears
if
i
could
not
weep
suppose
the
tears
not
come
i
thought
with
ridiculous
and
puerile
fear
as
if
my
fate
depended
on
this
slight
material
fact
that
my
will
did
not
suffice
to
produce
and
yet
a
voice
always
the
same
whispered
inwardly
what
a
mistake
what
a
mistake
no
opportunity
could
be
more
propitious
one
can
scarcely
see
one
s
self
in
this
room
what
effect
sobbing
would
have
in
the
dark
you
do
not
answer
me
tullio
went
on
juliana
after
a
short
silence
passing
her
hand
over
my
face
and
through
my
hair
to
compel
me
to
raise
my
face
you
know
you
can
tell
me
everything
ah
in
truth
never
since
then
have
i
heard
a
human
voice
of
such
sweetness
even
my
mother
had
never
spoken
to
me
like
that
my
eyes
became
moist
and
i
felt
between
my
lids
the
warmth
of
the
tears
quick
this
is
the
moment
you
must
burst
out
but
it
was
only
a
solitary
tear
and
shall
i
make
the
humiliating
confession
but
it
is
in
the
comedy
of
similar
puerilities
that
the
manifestations
of
the
major
part
of
human
emotions
are
lowered
i
raised
my
face
to
permit
juliana
to
notice
it
and
for
an
instant
i
felt
an
insane
anxiety
because
i
feared
that
in
the
dark
she
would
be
unable
to
see
the
tear
glisten
to
attract
her
attention
to
it
i
gave
a
deep
sigh
as
one
does
when
trying
to
repress
a
sob
bringing
her
face
close
to
mine
so
as
to
examine
it
more
closely
and
made
uneasy
by
my
prolonged
silence
she
repeated
you
don
t
answer
me
then
she
noticed
it
and
to
be
more
certain
she
seized
my
head
and
drew
it
back
with
an
almost
brutal
movement
you
are
crying
her
voice
had
changed
i
freed
myself
as
if
confused
i
rose
to
flee
like
one
who
is
no
longer
master
of
an
overflowing
affliction
adieu
adieu
let
me
go
adieu
juliana
and
i
left
the
room
precipitately
when
i
was
alone
i
felt
disgusted
with
myself
it
was
the
evening
of
the
party
given
in
honor
of
the
invalid
a
few
hours
later
when
i
went
back
to
her
to
be
present
as
usual
at
her
slight
meal
i
found
that
my
mother
was
with
her
as
soon
as
my
mother
saw
me
she
cried
well
tullio
is
the
great
day
juliana
and
i
looked
at
each
other
both
of
us
anxious
then
we
spoke
of
the
morrow
of
the
hour
at
which
she
should
rise
of
a
thousand
petty
details
but
with
a
kind
of
effort
we
were
preoccupied
i
wished
inwardly
that
my
mother
would
not
leave
us
alone
i
was
fortunate
my
mother
left
us
only
once
and
came
in
again
almost
immediately
in
the
interval
juliana
asked
me
rapidly
what
was
the
matter
with
you
a
short
time
ago
won
t
you
tell
me
nothing
nothing
see
how
you
will
spoil
my
pleasure
no
no
i
ll
tell
you
i
ll
tell
you
later
forget
it
for
the
present
please
my
mother
came
in
with
maria
and
natalia
but
the
tone
in
which
juliana
had
pronounced
those
few
words
sufficed
to
convince
me
that
she
suspected
nothing
of
the
truth
perhaps
she
supposed
that
my
sorrow
arose
from
a
sombre
recollection
of
my
ineffaceable
and
inexpiable
past
or
supposed
that
i
was
tortured
by
remorse
for
having
done
her
so
much
wrong
and
by
the
fear
of
not
deserving
her
full
pardon
the
following
morning
i
was
again
much
agitated
in
obedience
to
her
wish
i
was
waiting
in
an
adjoining
room
when
i
heard
her
call
me
in
her
limpid
tones
come
here
tullio
i
entered
she
was
standing
up
and
seemed
taller
more
svelte
more
fragile
robed
in
a
sort
of
ample
and
wavy
tunic
with
long
straight
folds
she
smiled
hesitating
scarcely
able
to
stand
with
her
arms
stretched
out
as
if
to
maintain
her
equilibrium
turning
by
turns
toward
me
and
my
mother
my
mother
looked
at
her
with
an
inexpressible
expression
of
tenderness
ready
to
give
her
support
i
too
stretched
out
my
hands
ready
to
support
her
no
no
please
she
said
let
me
be
let
me
be
i
am
strong
i
want
to
walk
all
alone
as
far
as
the
armchair
she
advanced
one
foot
and
made
a
step
slowly
her
face
lit
up
with
an
infantile
joy
take
care
juliana
she
made
two
or
three
steps
more
then
seized
by
a
sudden
fear
a
foolish
dread
that
she
was
about
to
fall
she
hesitated
for
an
instant
between
my
mother
and
me
and
ended
by
throwing
herself
in
my
arms
on
my
breast
a
dead
weight
and
trembling
as
if
she
were
sobbing
on
the
contrary
she
was
laughing
a
little
oppressed
by
her
nervousness
and
as
she
wore
no
corset
my
hands
felt
through
the
dress
how
meagre
and
frail
she
was
my
breast
felt
each
motion
of
the
palpitating
and
sickly
form
my
nostrils
respired
the
perfume
of
her
hair
my
eyes
recognized
the
little
brown
mole
upon
her
neck
i
was
afraid
she
said
in
a
gasp
laughing
and
panting
i
was
afraid
i
should
fall
and
as
she
threw
back
her
head
without
detaching
herself
from
me
so
as
to
look
at
my
mother
i
caught
a
slight
view
of
her
bloodless
gums
the
whites
of
her
eyes
and
the
convulsed
appearance
of
her
entire
face
i
felt
as
though
i
were
holding
in
my
arms
a
poor
ill
creature
profoundly
afflicted
by
her
malady
with
debilitated
nerves
impoverished
veins
and
perhaps
incurable
but
i
thought
again
also
of
her
transfiguration
of
the
evening
of
the
unexpected
kiss
and
the
labor
of
charity
of
love
and
of
reform
which
i
was
renouncing
once
more
seemed
to
me
a
labor
of
sovereign
beauty
tullio
lead
me
to
the
she
said
supporting
her
with
my
arm
passed
around
her
waist
i
led
her
slowly
and
gently
i
helped
her
to
sit
in
it
i
arranged
the
down
cushions
at
her
back
and
i
remember
that
i
chose
the
cushion
having
the
most
exquisite
shade
for
her
to
lean
her
head
upon
then
in
order
to
slip
one
beneath
her
feet
i
went
down
on
my
knees
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
gray
stocking
and
her
little
slipper
that
hid
only
the
tip
of
her
foot
as
on
she
followed
all
my
movements
with
affectionate
interest
i
took
a
long
time
to
do
everything
i
went
up
to
a
small
placed
on
it
a
vase
of
fresh
flowers
a
book
and
an
ivory
without
having
premeditated
it
i
put
into
these
attentions
a
shade
of
affectation
the
ironical
voice
went
on
very
clever
very
clever
acting
like
this
before
your
mother
will
help
you
considerably
how
could
she
suspect
anything
after
being
a
witness
of
such
an
exhibition
of
tenderness
besides
the
shade
of
affectation
won
t
be
noticed
the
poor
woman
is
a
little
go
on
go
on
everything
is
progressing
famously
keep
it
up
oh
how
nice
it
is
here
exclaimed
juliana
with
a
sigh
of
relief
and
her
eyes
thank
you
tullio
a
few
minutes
later
when
my
mother
had
gone
out
and
we
were
alone
she
repeated
in
a
deeper
tone
thank
you
she
raised
a
hand
towards
me
so
that
i
might
take
it
in
mine
as
her
sleeve
was
large
the
gesture
exposed
the
arm
almost
as
far
as
the
elbow
and
that
white
and
faithful
hand
which
offered
me
love
indulgence
peace
dreamland
oblivion
all
that
is
beautiful
and
all
that
is
good
trembled
in
the
air
a
second
stretched
towards
me
as
if
making
the
supreme
offering
i
believe
that
at
the
hour
of
death
at
the
precise
instant
when
my
sufferings
come
to
an
end
it
will
be
that
gesture
only
that
one
that
i
shall
see
amid
all
the
numberless
images
of
my
past
life
i
shall
see
only
that
one
gesture
when
i
look
back
i
do
not
succeed
in
reconstructing
with
exactitude
the
state
of
soul
in
which
i
found
myself
what
i
can
affirm
is
that
again
at
that
moment
i
understood
the
extreme
gravity
of
the
situation
and
the
prime
importance
of
the
acts
that
were
being
accomplished
or
that
were
about
to
be
accomplished
i
had
or
i
believed
i
had
perfect
lucidity
two
phenomena
of
my
conscience
were
developing
without
becoming
confounded
perfectly
distinct
parallel
in
one
of
them
predominated
joined
to
pity
for
the
poor
creature
whom
i
was
on
the
point
of
striking
a
bitter
sentiment
of
regret
for
the
offering
that
i
was
about
to
reject
in
the
other
predominated
joined
to
the
deep
eager
desire
for
the
absent
mistress
an
egotistical
sentiment
that
busied
itself
in
coldly
examining
the
circumstances
most
suitable
for
favoring
my
impunity
this
parallelism
gave
to
my
inner
life
an
incredible
intensity
and
acceleration
the
decisive
hour
had
come
having
to
start
the
following
morning
i
could
not
temporize
any
longer
so
that
the
affair
should
not
seem
too
ambiguous
and
altogether
too
sudden
i
must
prepare
my
mother
for
my
departure
that
very
morning
at
breakfast
and
allege
some
plausible
pretext
i
must
also
tell
juliana
before
telling
my
mother
so
as
to
prevent
any
possible
contretemps
and
suppose
juliana
should
rebel
suppose
in
a
moment
of
grief
and
indignation
she
reveals
the
truth
to
my
mother
how
can
i
obtain
from
her
a
promise
of
silence
a
new
act
of
abnegation
up
to
the
last
moment
i
argued
with
myself
will
she
understand
immediately
at
the
first
word
and
if
she
should
not
understand
if
she
should
innocently
ask
me
the
object
of
my
journey
what
could
i
answer
but
she
will
understand
it
is
impossible
that
she
has
not
already
learned
from
one
of
her
friends
from
signora
talice
for
instance
that
teresa
raffo
has
left
rome
my
strength
began
to
give
way
i
could
not
have
borne
much
longer
the
crisis
that
became
more
acute
each
moment
with
a
contraction
of
all
my
nerves
i
came
to
a
decision
and
since
she
was
speaking
i
determined
that
she
herself
should
furnish
me
the
opportunity
for
delivering
the
blow
she
spoke
of
a
thousand
things
and
especially
of
the
future
with
unaccustomed
volubility
that
strange
convulsed
appearance
that
i
had
already
noticed
in
her
seemed
more
apparent
i
was
still
standing
behind
her
chair
up
to
then
i
had
avoided
her
eyes
by
adroit
manoeuvring
in
the
room
remaining
attentive
behind
her
chair
busy
either
in
arranging
the
window
curtains
or
straightening
the
books
in
the
little
bookcase
or
in
picking
up
from
the
carpet
the
petals
of
a
bouquet
of
roses
that
had
shed
its
leaves
standing
up
i
looked
at
the
parting
in
her
hair
her
long
and
curved
eyelashes
the
light
palpitation
of
her
bosom
and
her
hands
her
beautiful
hands
extended
on
the
arms
of
the
lying
flat
just
as
on
that
day
white
as
on
that
day
when
they
could
be
distinguished
from
the
linen
only
by
the
azure
of
their
veins
oh
that
day
not
more
than
a
week
had
gone
by
since
then
why
did
it
seem
to
me
to
be
so
far
away
standing
behind
her
in
that
state
of
extreme
tension
and
so
to
speak
on
the
watch
i
imagined
that
perhaps
she
instinctively
felt
the
danger
hovering
over
her
head
i
believed
i
divined
in
her
a
sort
of
vague
uneasiness
once
more
i
felt
sick
at
heart
she
finally
said
if
i
am
better
you
will
take
me
out
on
the
terrace
in
the
open
air
i
interrupted
her
i
shall
not
be
here
she
trembled
at
my
strange
voice
i
added
without
waiting
i
am
going
then
making
a
violent
effort
to
loosen
my
tongue
and
terrified
like
a
man
who
must
strike
a
second
blow
to
put
his
victim
to
death
i
added
hastily
i
am
going
to
florence
ah
she
had
suddenly
understood
she
turned
round
with
a
rapid
movement
she
twisted
herself
on
her
cushions
to
look
me
in
the
face
and
in
that
tragic
pose
i
saw
again
the
whites
of
her
eyes
and
her
bloodless
gum
juliana
i
stammered
without
finding
anything
else
to
say
to
her
bending
toward
her
fearing
she
would
faint
but
she
lowered
her
eyelids
sank
back
withdrew
into
herself
so
to
speak
as
if
chilled
by
severe
cold
she
remained
thus
for
several
minutes
her
eyes
closed
lips
compressed
motionless
only
the
pulsations
of
the
carotid
artery
visible
at
the
neck
and
a
few
convulsive
contractions
of
her
hands
indicated
that
she
was
still
alive
was
not
this
a
crime
yes
this
was
the
of
my
crimes
and
not
the
least
without
a
doubt
i
went
away
under
terrible
circumstances
my
absence
lasted
more
than
a
week
on
my
return
and
the
days
following
i
was
astonished
myself
at
my
almost
cynical
impudence
i
was
bewitched
by
a
sort
of
malefice
that
suspended
in
me
every
moral
sense
and
rendered
me
capable
of
the
worst
injustices
the
worst
cruelties
this
time
again
juliana
exhibited
prodigious
force
of
character
this
time
again
she
was
able
to
keep
silent
she
appeared
to
me
wrapped
up
in
her
silence
as
if
in
an
impenetrable
adamantine
wall
she
went
to
the
badiola
with
her
daughters
and
my
mother
my
brother
accompanied
them
i
remained
in
rome
it
was
then
that
began
for
me
a
frightful
period
of
sombre
misery
the
recollection
of
which
suffices
to
fill
me
with
disgust
and
humiliation
harassed
by
a
feeling
that
more
than
any
other
stirs
up
in
man
the
dregs
of
his
being
i
suffered
every
torture
that
a
woman
can
make
a
feeble
passionate
and
soul
suffer
the
fire
of
a
terrible
sensual
jealousy
kindled
by
suspicion
dried
up
in
me
every
honest
source
fed
on
the
dregs
deposited
in
the
baser
depths
of
my
animal
nature
never
had
teresa
raffo
seemed
to
me
to
be
so
desirable
as
since
the
day
when
i
indissolubly
associated
her
with
an
ignoble
image
and
a
stain
and
she
made
herself
a
weapon
of
my
very
contempt
to
excite
my
covetousness
atrocious
agonies
abject
joys
dishonoring
submission
cowardly
complacencies
proposed
and
unblushingly
accepted
tears
more
acrid
than
all
the
poisons
sudden
frenzies
that
drove
me
almost
to
the
confines
of
dementia
such
violent
plunges
into
the
abyss
of
indulgence
that
for
many
days
after
i
lay
in
a
stupefied
state
every
misery
every
ignominy
of
the
lower
passions
exasperated
by
yes
i
have
known
all
i
became
a
stranger
in
my
own
house
the
presence
of
juliana
became
an
encumbrance
to
me
sometimes
entire
weeks
passed
without
my
addressing
a
single
word
to
her
absorbed
in
my
inner
torture
i
did
not
see
her
i
did
not
listen
to
her
at
certain
moments
when
i
raised
my
eyes
towards
her
i
was
surprised
at
her
pallor
at
the
expression
of
her
face
by
such
and
such
a
detail
of
her
features
as
if
these
things
were
new
unexpected
strange
i
did
not
succeed
in
entirely
reconquering
the
notion
of
the
reality
every
act
of
her
life
was
unknown
to
me
i
felt
no
desire
to
question
her
to
know
anything
i
felt
neither
preoccupation
interest
nor
fear
in
regard
to
her
an
inexplicable
coldness
acted
as
a
cuirass
against
her
and
still
more
sometimes
i
felt
a
kind
of
vague
and
inexplicable
rancor
against
her
one
day
i
saw
her
laugh
and
that
laugh
irritated
me
almost
put
me
in
a
passion
another
day
i
had
a
shock
on
hearing
her
singing
in
a
distant
room
she
was
singing
an
air
from
orphée
sans
eurydice
that
was
the
first
time
she
had
sung
while
going
through
the
house
for
a
long
time
it
was
the
first
time
i
heard
her
for
a
long
time
why
was
she
singing
was
she
then
happy
to
what
condition
of
her
soul
does
that
unusual
effusion
correspond
an
inexplicable
agitation
seized
me
without
thinking
i
went
up
to
her
calling
her
by
name
when
she
saw
me
enter
her
room
she
was
surprised
and
remained
for
a
moment
speechless
she
was
evidently
startled
are
you
singing
i
said
so
as
to
say
something
embarrassed
and
astonished
myself
at
the
eccentricity
of
what
i
was
doing
she
smiled
a
hesitating
smile
not
knowing
what
to
answer
not
knowing
what
attitude
to
assume
toward
me
and
i
thought
i
read
in
her
eyes
a
grieved
curiosity
the
fugitive
expression
of
which
i
had
already
noticed
more
than
compassionate
curiosity
with
which
one
gazes
at
a
person
suspected
of
insanity
a
maniac
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
saw
myself
in
a
mirror
opposite
and
my
face
looked
emaciated
my
eyes
sunken
my
mouth
puffed
feverish
appearance
that
i
had
had
for
a
month
are
you
dressing
to
go
out
i
asked
still
disturbed
almost
ashamed
not
finding
any
other
question
to
ask
her
preoccupied
only
with
avoiding
silence
yes
it
was
in
the
morning
in
november
she
was
standing
near
a
table
trimmed
with
lace
and
on
which
scintillated
the
scattered
innumerable
little
articles
that
serve
nowadays
to
beautify
women
she
wore
a
dress
of
vigonia
of
a
dark
color
and
held
in
her
hand
a
shell
comb
mounted
in
silver
the
dress
very
simple
in
cut
set
off
her
slim
graceful
figure
a
large
bouquet
of
white
chrysanthemums
placed
on
the
table
reached
up
as
far
as
her
shoulder
the
sun
of
the
martin
s
summer
entered
through
the
window
and
in
the
air
there
was
a
perfume
of
chypre
or
some
other
odor
i
could
not
recognize
what
perfume
do
you
use
now
i
asked
she
replied
i
like
it
i
said
she
took
a
small
bottle
from
the
table
and
handed
it
to
me
i
inhaled
it
deeply
so
as
to
be
doing
something
and
to
gain
time
to
prepare
some
other
phrase
i
did
not
succeed
in
dissipating
my
confusion
or
in
recovering
my
assurance
i
felt
that
all
intimacy
between
us
was
at
an
end
she
seemed
to
me
to
be
and
yet
the
air
from
orphée
still
surged
through
my
soul
still
disturbed
me
sans
eurydice
in
that
warm
and
golden
light
amidst
that
delightful
perfume
among
these
objects
impressed
with
feminine
grace
the
echo
of
the
ancient
melody
seemed
to
put
the
palpitation
of
a
secret
life
to
shed
a
shadow
of
some
strange
mystery
the
air
that
you
sang
just
now
is
very
beautiful
i
said
obeying
an
impulse
that
came
from
my
uneasiness
yes
very
beautiful
she
cried
a
question
rose
to
my
lips
why
are
you
singing
but
i
repressed
it
and
began
to
seek
in
myself
the
reasons
of
the
curiosity
which
tormented
me
there
was
an
interval
of
silence
she
ran
her
across
the
teeth
of
the
comb
producing
a
light
grating
noise
this
grating
is
a
circumstance
that
i
recall
with
perfect
clearness
you
were
dressing
to
go
out
go
on
i
said
i
have
only
to
put
on
my
jacket
and
hat
what
time
is
it
a
quarter
to
eleven
what
so
late
already
she
took
her
hat
and
veil
and
sat
down
before
the
glass
i
watched
her
another
question
rose
to
my
lips
where
are
you
going
yet
although
it
might
appear
quite
natural
i
restrained
myself
again
and
continued
to
observe
juliana
attentively
she
reappeared
to
me
once
more
what
she
was
in
young
and
stylish
woman
a
gentle
and
noble
face
full
of
a
refined
physical
delicacy
radiant
with
an
intense
moral
expression
in
short
an
adorable
woman
and
one
who
could
be
as
delightful
a
mistress
for
the
flesh
as
for
the
mind
suppose
she
were
really
someone
s
mistress
i
thought
then
assuredly
it
is
impossible
but
that
many
men
have
hovered
around
her
everyone
knows
how
i
neglect
her
everyone
knows
how
i
wrong
her
suppose
she
has
yielded
or
is
about
to
yield
suppose
she
has
at
last
considered
the
sacrifice
of
her
youth
to
be
useless
and
unjust
suppose
she
was
at
last
grown
tired
of
her
abnegation
suppose
she
has
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
man
superior
to
me
some
delicate
and
deep
seducer
who
has
inspired
her
with
renewed
curiosity
who
has
taught
her
to
forget
her
faithless
husband
suppose
i
have
already
lost
her
heart
which
i
have
so
often
trampled
upon
without
pity
and
without
remorse
a
sudden
fright
seized
me
and
the
anguish
was
so
keen
that
i
thought
that
is
what
i
will
do
i
will
confess
my
suspicion
to
juliana
i
will
look
into
the
depths
of
her
eyes
and
say
are
you
still
and
i
will
know
the
truth
she
is
incapable
of
lying
incapable
of
lying
ah
ah
ah
a
woman
what
do
you
know
about
it
a
woman
is
capable
of
everything
never
forget
that
sometimes
the
large
cloak
of
heroism
serves
but
to
hide
half
a
dozen
lovers
sacrifice
abnegation
those
are
appearances
words
who
will
ever
know
the
truth
swear
if
you
dare
that
your
wife
is
faithful
to
you
and
i
speak
not
of
the
present
faithfulness
but
of
that
which
preceded
the
episode
of
the
illness
swear
in
perfect
assurance
if
you
dare
and
the
wicked
voice
ah
teresa
raffo
how
your
poison
acts
the
perfidious
voice
made
me
shudder
do
not
be
impatient
tullio
said
juliana
almost
timidly
will
you
stick
this
pin
in
my
she
raised
her
arms
and
held
them
over
her
head
to
fasten
the
veil
and
her
white
fingers
tried
in
vain
to
fasten
it
her
pose
was
full
of
grace
the
white
fingers
made
me
think
how
long
it
is
since
we
clasped
hands
oh
the
frank
and
warm
clasps
that
her
hand
used
to
give
me
as
if
to
assure
me
that
she
bore
me
no
for
any
offence
now
that
hand
is
perhaps
defiled
and
while
i
fastened
the
veil
i
felt
a
sudden
revulsion
in
thinking
of
the
possible
pollution
she
arose
and
i
helped
her
again
to
put
on
her
cloak
two
or
three
times
our
eyes
met
by
stealth
and
again
i
observed
in
hers
a
sort
of
anxious
curiosity
perhaps
she
was
asking
herself
why
did
he
come
in
here
why
is
he
staying
here
what
does
that
air
mean
what
does
he
want
with
me
what
has
happened
to
him
excuse
me
a
moment
she
said
and
she
left
the
room
i
heard
her
call
miss
edith
the
governess
when
i
was
alone
my
eyes
turned
involuntarily
towards
the
small
desk
littered
with
letters
cards
and
books
i
approached
and
my
eyes
ran
for
an
instant
over
the
papers
as
if
they
sought
to
the
perhaps
i
dismissed
this
base
and
stupid
suspicion
i
looked
at
a
book
covered
with
an
antique
cloth
with
a
small
dagger
stuck
between
the
leaves
she
had
not
yet
finished
reading
it
and
had
cut
only
about
half
of
it
it
was
the
latest
novel
by
filippo
arborio
i
read
on
the
frontispiece
an
autographic
dedication
by
the
author
to
you
juliana
hermil
turris
eburnea
i
offer
this
unworthy
homage
arborio
all
saints
day
so
juliana
knew
the
novelist
and
what
did
juliana
think
of
him
i
conjured
up
the
writer
s
fine
and
seductive
face
as
i
had
seen
it
several
times
in
public
there
was
certainly
much
in
him
that
must
please
juliana
according
to
current
gossip
he
pleased
women
his
romances
full
of
a
complicated
psychology
at
times
very
subtle
often
false
disturbed
sentimental
souls
fired
restless
imaginations
taught
with
supreme
grace
contempt
of
common
life
agony
the
true
catholic
angelica
doni
giorgio
aliora
the
suggested
an
intense
vision
of
life
as
if
life
were
a
vast
conflagration
of
innumerable
ardent
figures
each
of
his
characters
fought
for
his
chimera
in
a
hopeless
duel
against
reality
had
not
this
extraordinary
artist
who
in
his
books
appeared
to
be
so
to
speak
like
a
distilled
quintessence
of
pure
spirit
also
exerted
his
fascination
on
me
had
i
not
said
of
his
that
it
was
a
work
had
i
not
found
in
certain
of
his
literary
creations
strange
resemblances
with
my
inner
being
and
suppose
the
strange
affinity
that
there
is
between
us
facilitated
his
work
of
seduction
perhaps
already
undertaken
suppose
juliana
was
yielding
to
him
precisely
because
she
had
recognized
in
him
some
one
of
those
attractions
by
which
previously
i
had
made
myself
adored
by
her
i
thought
with
a
new
fright
she
reëntered
the
room
on
seeing
me
with
the
book
in
my
hand
she
said
with
an
embarrassed
smile
and
blushing
slightly
what
are
you
looking
at
do
you
know
filippo
arborio
i
asked
her
immediately
but
without
any
change
in
my
voice
in
the
most
calm
and
natural
voice
that
i
could
command
yes
she
answered
frankly
he
was
introduced
to
me
at
the
monterisi
he
has
even
been
here
several
times
but
you
have
not
had
the
opportunity
of
meeting
him
a
question
rose
to
my
lips
why
have
you
never
spoken
of
him
to
me
but
i
restrained
it
how
could
she
have
mentioned
it
since
by
my
attitude
i
had
interrupted
for
a
long
time
past
all
friendly
exchange
of
news
and
confidences
he
is
much
more
simple
than
his
works
would
lead
one
to
suppose
she
continued
carelessly
slowly
drawing
on
her
gloves
have
you
read
yes
i
have
read
it
did
you
like
it
without
thinking
and
by
an
instinctive
desire
to
affirm
my
superiority
in
juliana
s
eyes
i
answered
no
it
is
commonplace
at
last
she
said
i
am
going
she
made
a
motion
to
leave
i
followed
her
as
far
as
the
antechamber
walking
in
the
wake
of
the
perfume
she
left
behind
her
so
subtle
as
to
be
scarcely
perceptible
in
the
presence
of
the
servant
she
said
only
and
with
a
light
step
she
crossed
the
threshold
i
went
back
to
my
room
i
opened
the
window
and
leaned
out
to
watch
her
in
the
street
she
hurried
along
with
her
light
step
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
street
straight
on
without
turning
her
head
to
the
right
or
left
the
martin
summer
shed
a
delicate
gilding
over
the
crystal
of
the
sky
a
calm
warmth
softened
the
air
and
conjured
up
the
perfume
of
the
absent
violets
an
immense
sadness
weighed
on
me
crashed
me
down
on
the
gradually
it
became
intolerable
rarely
in
my
life
have
i
suffered
so
much
as
from
that
doubt
which
crumbled
at
one
stroke
my
faith
in
juliana
a
faith
that
had
lasted
for
so
many
years
rarely
had
the
flight
of
an
illusion
drawn
from
my
soul
such
cries
of
anguish
but
was
it
true
that
the
illusion
had
fled
and
that
the
evil
was
irremediable
i
could
not
i
would
not
be
persuaded
of
it
that
great
illusion
had
been
the
companion
of
my
whole
misguided
life
it
answered
not
only
to
the
exigencies
of
my
egotism
but
also
to
my
æsthetic
dream
of
moral
greatness
since
moral
greatness
results
from
the
violence
of
pains
which
one
triumphs
over
it
is
necessary
so
that
she
may
have
an
opportunity
to
be
heroic
that
she
should
suffer
all
i
have
made
her
suffer
this
axiom
which
had
often
succeeded
in
calming
my
remorse
was
deeply
rooted
in
my
mind
and
had
caused
to
surge
there
from
the
best
part
of
myself
an
ideal
phantom
to
which
i
had
vowed
a
sort
of
platonic
cult
debauched
culpable
tired
i
took
pleasure
in
recognizing
in
the
ray
of
my
own
existence
a
soul
severe
upright
and
strong
an
incorruptible
soul
and
it
pleased
me
to
be
the
object
of
its
love
of
an
eternal
love
all
my
vice
all
my
misery
all
my
feebleness
found
a
support
in
this
illusion
i
believed
that
for
me
there
was
a
possible
realization
of
the
dream
of
all
intellectual
men
to
be
constantly
unfaithful
to
a
constantly
faithful
woman
what
are
you
seeking
all
the
intoxication
of
life
very
well
go
run
on
intoxicate
yourself
in
your
house
a
dumb
creature
remembers
and
waits
like
a
veiled
image
in
a
sanctuary
the
lamp
in
which
you
do
not
put
a
single
drop
more
of
oil
burns
without
ever
becoming
extinguished
is
not
that
the
dream
of
all
intellectual
men
and
again
no
matter
at
what
hour
no
matter
after
what
adventure
you
will
find
her
there
on
your
return
she
was
awaiting
your
return
with
confidence
but
she
will
not
tell
you
of
her
waiting
you
will
rest
your
head
on
her
knees
and
she
will
caress
your
temples
with
her
to
take
away
your
pain
i
had
a
presentiment
that
one
day
i
would
return
thus
i
would
end
by
coming
back
after
one
of
those
intimate
catastrophes
that
metamorphose
a
man
all
my
hopelessnesses
were
softened
by
the
secret
conviction
that
this
refuge
could
not
fail
me
and
in
the
depth
of
my
abjectness
a
little
light
came
to
me
from
that
woman
who
for
love
of
me
and
my
had
raised
herself
to
the
summit
of
greatness
and
had
perfectly
realized
the
form
of
my
ideal
would
one
doubt
suffice
to
destroy
all
that
in
a
moment
i
repassed
from
one
end
to
the
other
the
scene
that
had
taken
place
between
juliana
and
myself
from
the
moment
i
had
entered
the
room
to
the
instant
she
had
left
it
and
it
was
in
vain
i
attributed
a
great
part
of
my
inner
agitation
to
a
special
and
transient
nervous
condition
i
could
not
succeed
in
dissipating
the
strange
impression
exactly
translated
by
these
words
she
seemed
to
me
to
be
there
was
certainly
something
new
about
her
but
what
was
not
filippo
arborio
s
dedication
in
a
sense
reassuring
did
it
not
precisely
affirm
that
the
was
impregnable
this
glorious
qualification
had
been
suggested
to
the
author
either
simply
by
the
reputation
for
purity
that
juliana
hermil
s
name
bore
or
by
the
of
an
attempted
assault
or
possibly
by
the
abandonment
of
a
siege
undertaken
in
consequence
the
ivory
tower
still
remained
unsullied
while
reasoning
thus
to
allay
the
gnawings
of
suspicion
i
could
not
remove
the
confused
anxiety
that
lay
at
the
bottom
of
my
being
as
if
i
feared
a
sudden
apparition
of
some
ironical
objection
you
know
juliana
has
extraordinarily
white
skin
she
is
literally
white
as
her
the
pious
qualification
might
well
hide
some
profane
meaning
but
the
word
oh
oh
what
subtleties
an
attack
of
impatience
and
anger
cut
short
this
humiliating
and
vain
debate
i
withdrew
from
the
window
shrugged
my
shoulders
made
two
or
three
turns
in
the
room
mechanically
opened
a
book
then
threw
it
down
again
but
my
anguish
did
not
decrease
in
short
i
thought
stopping
short
as
if
to
confront
some
invisible
adversary
to
what
does
all
this
lead
me
either
she
has
already
fallen
and
the
loss
is
irreparable
or
she
is
in
danger
and
in
my
present
situation
i
can
not
interfere
to
save
her
or
else
she
is
pure
and
then
there
is
no
change
in
any
case
it
is
not
for
me
to
what
exists
exists
of
necessity
what
is
to
happen
will
of
necessity
happen
this
crisis
of
suffering
will
pass
one
must
wait
how
beautiful
those
white
chrysanthemums
were
that
were
on
juliana
s
table
just
now
i
will
go
and
buy
a
heap
more
just
like
them
my
rendezvous
with
teresa
is
for
two
o
clock
i
have
still
almost
three
hours
before
me
did
she
not
tell
me
the
last
time
that
she
wished
to
find
the
fire
burning
this
will
be
the
first
fire
of
the
winter
on
such
a
warm
day
it
seems
to
me
she
is
in
a
week
of
kindness
i
only
hope
it
will
last
but
at
the
first
opportunity
i
shall
challenge
eugenio
egano
my
thoughts
followed
a
new
course
with
sudden
checks
with
unforeseen
divergences
in
the
midst
even
of
the
pictures
of
the
approaching
voluptuousness
another
contaminating
imagination
passed
like
a
lightning
flash
one
that
i
feared
one
from
which
i
should
like
to
flee
certain
audacious
and
ardent
pages
of
true
recurred
to
me
one
of
these
passions
aroused
the
other
and
while
suffering
from
the
distinct
pains
i
confounded
the
two
women
in
the
same
pollution
filippo
arborio
and
eugenio
egano
in
the
same
hate
the
crisis
passed
leaving
in
my
soul
a
species
of
vague
contempt
mixed
with
rancor
against
the
i
drifted
away
still
further
from
her
i
became
more
and
more
hardened
more
and
more
careless
more
and
more
reserved
my
sad
passion
for
teresa
raffo
became
more
exclusive
occupied
all
my
faculties
left
me
no
respite
i
was
really
a
maniac
a
man
possessed
by
a
diabolical
insanity
devoured
by
an
unknown
and
frightful
malady
my
mind
has
retained
of
that
winter
only
confused
incoherent
souvenirs
interspersed
with
strange
rare
obscurities
that
winter
i
never
encountered
filippo
arborio
at
my
house
but
i
saw
him
sometimes
in
public
one
evening
however
i
met
him
in
a
salle
d
armes
and
there
we
became
acquainted
we
were
introduced
by
the
and
we
exchanged
a
few
words
the
gaslight
the
creaking
of
the
flooring
the
flash
and
clatter
of
the
foils
the
clumsy
or
graceful
attitudes
of
the
swordsmen
the
rapid
extension
of
all
those
bent
limbs
the
warm
and
acrid
exhalations
of
all
those
bodies
the
guttural
cries
rude
interjections
the
bursts
of
are
the
details
that
my
memory
furnishes
to
reconstruct
with
singular
clearness
the
scene
that
unrolled
itself
before
us
while
we
were
standing
face
to
face
and
the
master
pronounced
our
names
i
again
see
the
gesture
with
which
filippo
arborio
raising
his
mask
displayed
a
heated
face
all
bathed
in
perspiration
he
was
panting
with
fatigue
and
somewhat
convulsed
like
a
man
unaccustomed
to
muscular
exercise
instinctively
i
thought
that
he
would
not
be
a
formidable
opponent
in
a
duel
i
affected
also
a
certain
haughtiness
i
especially
avoided
saying
anything
that
bore
any
reference
to
his
celebrity
or
to
my
admiration
i
assumed
the
attitude
i
would
have
taken
towards
a
perfect
stranger
so
it
is
for
said
the
to
me
smiling
yes
at
ten
o
clock
are
you
going
to
fight
asked
arborio
with
evident
curiosity
yes
he
hesitated
a
little
and
then
added
may
i
ask
with
whom
if
it
is
not
an
indiscretion
with
eugenio
egano
i
noticed
that
he
would
have
liked
to
learn
more
but
that
he
was
restrained
by
the
coldness
of
my
attitude
and
my
apparent
inattention
maestro
i
said
i
ll
give
you
five
minutes
i
turned
my
back
to
go
to
the
at
the
door
i
stopped
and
glancing
back
saw
that
arborio
had
recommenced
to
fence
one
glance
sufficed
to
show
me
that
he
was
a
very
poor
swordsman
when
watched
by
all
the
persons
present
i
engaged
with
the
a
singular
nervous
excitement
seized
upon
me
and
redoubled
my
energy
i
felt
arborio
s
eyes
were
fastened
on
me
later
on
i
saw
him
again
in
the
the
room
had
a
very
low
ceiling
and
was
already
full
of
smoke
and
an
acrid
sickening
smell
of
men
all
those
in
it
naked
save
for
their
large
white
were
smoking
and
slowly
rubbing
their
chests
arms
shoulders
and
chaffing
one
another
loudly
the
splashing
of
the
alternated
with
the
loud
laughter
two
or
three
times
with
an
indefinable
motion
of
repulsion
with
a
start
similar
to
that
which
a
violent
physical
shock
would
produce
i
saw
the
frail
form
of
arborio
whom
my
eyes
sought
involuntarily
and
once
again
the
odious
image
was
formed
since
then
i
had
no
other
opportunity
to
approach
or
meet
him
i
ceased
to
busy
myself
with
him
and
as
a
consequence
i
remarked
nothing
suspicious
in
juliana
s
behavior
outside
the
constantly
narrowing
circle
in
which
i
moved
there
no
longer
existed
for
me
anything
lucid
or
sensible
or
intelligent
every
external
impression
passed
over
me
like
drops
of
water
over
iron
rebounding
or
evaporating
events
came
one
after
the
other
toward
the
end
of
february
after
a
last
proof
of
infamy
a
definite
rupture
occurred
between
teresa
raffo
and
myself
i
left
for
venice
alone
i
remained
there
about
one
month
in
a
state
of
incomprehensible
uneasiness
in
a
sort
of
stupor
that
made
the
fogs
seem
thicker
and
the
lagoons
more
silent
there
remained
to
me
only
the
innate
sensation
of
my
own
isolation
amidst
the
inert
phantoms
of
all
things
for
long
hours
i
felt
no
other
sensation
than
that
of
the
persistent
and
crushing
weight
of
life
and
that
of
the
slight
pulsation
of
an
artery
in
my
head
for
long
hours
i
endured
that
strange
fascination
exerted
by
the
uninterrupted
and
monotonous
murmur
of
some
indistinct
thing
on
the
soul
it
drizzled
on
the
water
the
fog
at
times
took
on
lugubrious
forms
advancing
like
spectres
with
slow
and
solemn
step
often
i
found
a
sort
of
imaginary
death
in
a
gondola
as
in
a
coffin
when
the
rower
asked
where
i
desired
to
be
taken
i
almost
always
answered
by
a
vague
gesture
and
i
comprehended
internally
the
hopeless
sincerity
of
the
answer
matter
where
beyond
the
i
came
back
to
rome
during
the
last
days
of
march
i
felt
a
new
sensation
of
the
reality
as
if
after
a
long
eclipse
of
conscience
sometimes
unexpectedly
a
timidity
an
uneasiness
an
unreasoning
fear
seized
me
and
i
felt
as
powerless
as
an
infant
i
looked
about
me
ceaselessly
with
unusual
attention
to
grasp
once
more
the
true
sense
of
things
to
find
again
the
proper
connections
to
take
note
of
what
was
changed
and
what
had
disappeared
and
in
proportion
as
i
slowly
reëntered
into
the
ordinary
existence
the
equilibrium
reëstablished
itself
in
my
being
hope
revived
and
i
began
to
become
preoccupied
with
the
future
i
found
juliana
s
strength
much
reduced
and
her
health
very
much
changed
she
was
sadder
than
ever
we
spoke
but
little
and
without
looking
at
one
another
without
opening
our
hearts
we
both
sought
the
society
of
our
two
little
daughters
and
with
their
happy
innocence
maria
and
natalia
filled
our
long
silences
with
their
fresh
chatter
one
day
maria
asked
mamma
shall
we
go
this
easter
to
the
badiola
i
answered
without
hesitation
instead
of
her
mother
yes
we
shall
then
maria
began
to
dance
around
the
room
in
token
of
her
joy
dragging
her
sister
with
her
i
looked
at
juliana
does
it
suit
you
that
we
should
go
there
i
asked
fearfully
almost
humbly
she
consented
by
a
nod
i
see
you
are
not
well
i
added
nor
am
i
well
perhaps
the
country
the
spring
she
was
stretched
out
in
an
the
arms
of
which
supported
her
white
hands
and
that
attitude
recalled
another
of
the
convalescent
on
the
morning
when
she
first
rose
after
i
had
told
her
the
departure
was
decided
upon
we
made
our
preparations
a
hope
shone
in
the
depth
of
my
soul
but
i
dared
not
look
straight
at
it
my
first
recollection
is
as
follows
by
this
when
i
began
this
narrative
i
meant
among
my
recollections
this
is
the
first
in
any
way
connected
with
the
frightful
thing
it
was
therefore
in
april
we
had
been
at
the
badiola
for
several
days
ah
my
children
my
mother
had
said
with
her
unceremonious
candor
how
pale
you
both
look
oh
that
rome
that
rome
to
put
some
color
in
your
cheeks
you
must
stay
in
the
country
with
me
for
a
long
long
time
yes
juliana
had
answered
with
a
smile
yes
mother
we
will
stay
as
long
as
you
wish
that
smile
often
appeared
on
juliana
s
lips
when
my
mother
was
by
and
although
her
eyes
invariably
retained
their
melancholy
that
smile
was
so
sweet
so
profoundly
kind
that
i
permitted
even
myself
to
be
deceived
by
it
i
dared
now
to
entertain
some
hope
during
the
first
few
days
my
mother
could
not
tear
herself
away
from
her
dear
visitors
one
might
have
thought
she
wished
to
surfeit
them
with
tenderness
i
saw
her
two
or
three
times
under
the
influence
of
some
indefinable
emotion
i
saw
her
caress
juliana
s
hair
with
her
blessed
hand
i
heard
her
ask
her
is
he
as
kind
to
you
as
ever
yes
poor
tullio
replied
the
other
voice
so
it
is
not
true
what
i
was
told
that
what
were
you
told
nothing
nothing
i
thought
that
tullio
had
caused
you
some
unhappiness
they
spoke
in
the
embrasure
of
a
window
behind
waving
curtains
while
outside
the
wind
sighed
through
the
i
came
up
to
them
before
they
were
aware
of
my
presence
and
raising
a
portière
showed
myself
ah
tullio
cried
my
mother
they
exchanged
a
look
a
little
embarrassed
we
were
speaking
of
you
said
my
mother
of
me
bad
or
good
i
asked
lightly
good
replied
juliana
quickly
i
detected
in
her
voice
the
evident
intention
to
reassure
me
the
april
sun
shone
on
the
lit
up
my
mother
s
gray
hair
lightly
touched
juliana
s
temples
the
very
white
curtains
were
waving
to
and
fro
reflected
in
the
luminous
the
lofty
elms
on
the
lawn
covered
with
young
leaves
produced
a
murmur
at
times
loud
at
times
soft
on
which
the
shadows
more
or
less
stationary
regulated
their
swing
from
the
wall
of
the
house
covered
with
thousands
of
bunches
of
violets
arose
a
paschal
odor
like
an
invisible
vapor
of
incense
how
penetrating
that
odor
is
murmured
juliana
passing
her
hand
over
her
brow
and
her
eyes
it
makes
one
dizzy
i
was
between
her
and
my
mother
a
little
in
the
rear
a
desire
seized
me
to
put
my
arms
around
both
and
lean
out
of
the
window
in
that
familiar
and
simple
act
i
wished
to
put
all
the
tenderness
that
swelled
my
heart
and
make
juliana
understand
a
multitude
of
inexpressible
things
and
by
that
one
gesture
reconquer
her
entirely
but
i
was
restrained
by
an
almost
infantile
feeling
of
timidity
look
juliana
said
my
mother
pointing
to
the
top
of
the
hill
look
at
your
dear
lilacs
can
you
see
them
yes
yes
and
shading
her
eyes
from
the
sun
with
her
hand
she
made
an
effort
to
see
better
i
who
was
watching
her
remarked
a
slight
trembling
of
her
lower
lip
can
you
see
the
cypress
i
asked
her
with
the
intention
of
increasing
her
agitation
by
this
suggestive
question
and
i
saw
once
more
in
imagination
the
venerable
old
cypress
whose
trunk
rose
amid
a
and
whose
top
sheltered
a
nest
of
nightingales
yes
yes
i
see
it
but
with
difficulty
the
lilacs
stood
out
white
against
its
background
of
foliage
up
the
slope
the
chain
of
hills
rolled
away
in
the
distance
in
a
noble
peaceful
undulating
line
and
the
plantations
on
their
sides
appeared
of
extraordinary
lightness
like
a
kind
of
greenish
fog
piled
up
in
motionless
shapes
the
trees
in
blossom
dotted
here
and
there
with
bouquets
of
red
and
white
broke
the
uniformity
the
sky
seemed
to
pale
from
minute
to
minute
as
if
a
stream
of
milk
were
being
continually
spread
in
and
mixed
with
its
fluid
atmosphere
we
will
go
to
the
lilacs
after
easter
everything
there
will
be
in
flower
i
said
trying
to
revive
in
that
soul
the
dream
which
i
had
so
brutally
shattered
i
dared
to
draw
closer
to
her
and
put
my
arms
around
juliana
and
my
mother
and
lean
out
of
the
window
advancing
my
head
between
theirs
in
such
a
manner
that
the
hair
of
each
brushed
me
the
spring
the
purity
of
the
air
the
nobleness
of
the
country
the
peaceful
transfiguration
of
every
creature
by
the
season
s
maternal
influence
and
that
sky
that
sky
of
divine
paleness
more
divine
in
measure
as
it
became
awoke
in
me
such
a
new
sentiment
of
life
that
i
thought
with
an
internal
tremor
can
it
be
possible
can
it
be
possible
after
all
that
has
happened
after
all
that
i
have
suffered
after
so
many
transgressions
can
i
still
find
enjoyment
in
life
can
i
then
still
can
i
still
have
a
presentiment
of
happiness
from
whence
does
this
blessing
come
to
me
it
seemed
to
me
that
all
my
being
was
relieved
became
expanded
became
dilated
beyond
its
limits
with
a
subtle
rapid
and
continuous
vibration
nothing
can
convey
an
idea
of
the
feeling
developed
in
me
by
the
imperceptible
sensation
of
a
hair
grazing
my
cheek
we
remained
several
minutes
in
this
attitude
without
speaking
the
elms
moaned
the
constant
thrill
of
the
thousands
of
yellow
and
violet
flowers
that
carpeted
the
wall
beneath
our
window
enchanted
my
eyes
a
heavy
and
warm
perfume
arose
in
the
sunshine
with
the
rhythm
of
a
breath
all
at
once
juliana
drew
back
and
grew
pale
her
eyes
looked
troubled
her
mouth
was
contracted
as
if
with
nausea
she
said
that
odor
is
terrible
it
makes
one
giddy
are
you
not
affected
by
it
too
mother
she
turned
round
tottered
a
few
steps
and
left
the
room
hastily
my
mother
followed
her
i
watched
them
as
they
passed
through
the
corridors
still
dominated
by
what
rested
of
my
former
sensations
lost
in
the
dream
my
confidence
in
the
future
increased
from
day
to
day
it
was
as
if
i
had
forgotten
everything
my
soul
too
fatigued
no
longer
remembered
its
sufferings
at
certain
periods
of
complete
abandon
all
became
disintegrated
diluted
dissolved
lost
in
the
original
fluidity
became
unrecognizable
then
after
these
strange
internal
decompositions
it
seemed
to
me
that
a
new
principle
of
life
had
entered
into
me
that
a
new
power
had
penetrated
me
a
multitude
of
sensations
involuntary
spontaneous
unconscious
and
instinctive
made
up
my
real
existence
between
the
exterior
and
the
interior
there
was
established
a
play
of
minute
actions
and
instantaneous
minute
reactions
that
vibrated
in
endless
repercussions
and
each
one
of
these
incalculable
repercussions
became
converted
into
an
astonishing
psychic
phenomenon
my
entire
being
was
modified
by
the
slightest
odor
of
the
circumambient
atmosphere
by
a
breath
by
a
shadow
by
a
flash
of
light
the
great
maladies
of
the
soul
like
those
of
the
body
renew
a
man
and
the
convalescences
of
the
mind
are
not
less
charming
nor
less
miraculous
than
the
physical
convalescences
before
a
small
flowering
shrub
before
a
branch
covered
with
small
buds
before
a
vigorous
shoot
growing
out
of
an
old
and
almost
dead
trunk
before
the
most
modest
metamorphoses
accomplished
by
spring
i
stopped
artless
ingenuous
stupefied
often
in
the
morning
i
went
out
with
my
brother
at
that
hour
everything
was
cool
graceful
unconstrained
federico
s
company
purified
me
and
strengthened
me
not
less
than
the
good
country
air
federico
was
then
years
old
he
had
almost
always
lived
in
the
country
where
he
led
a
sober
and
laborious
existence
and
the
earth
seemed
to
have
communicated
to
him
its
mild
sincerity
he
was
in
possession
of
the
rule
of
life
leon
tolstoï
as
he
kissed
his
fine
serene
brow
would
have
called
him
my
son
we
walked
across
the
fields
without
an
object
exchanging
but
few
words
he
praised
the
fertility
of
our
domains
explained
to
me
the
innovations
introduced
in
their
cultivation
pointing
out
the
progress
made
the
cottages
of
our
peasants
were
large
and
airy
and
coquettishly
kept
our
stables
were
full
of
healthy
and
cattle
our
dairies
were
admirably
equipped
often
on
the
way
he
stopped
to
examine
a
plant
and
his
virile
hands
could
touch
with
the
greatest
delicacy
the
little
green
leaves
at
the
tip
of
a
new
shoot
at
times
we
passed
through
an
orchard
the
and
bore
on
their
branches
thousands
of
flowers
and
below
the
transparency
of
the
rosy
and
silvery
petals
metamorphosed
the
light
into
a
sort
of
humid
atmosphere
into
an
indescribable
thing
divinely
graceful
and
hospitable
through
the
small
interstices
of
these
light
garlands
smiled
the
blue
sky
while
i
was
admiring
the
flowers
he
was
already
anticipating
the
future
treasure
suspended
from
the
branches
and
said
you
will
will
see
the
fruit
yes
i
shall
see
it
i
repeated
to
myself
inwardly
i
shall
see
the
flowers
fall
the
leaves
born
the
fruit
grow
color
ripen
and
fall
it
was
from
my
brother
s
mouth
that
this
affirmation
first
issued
and
it
assumed
for
me
a
grave
importance
as
if
it
presaged
i
know
not
what
promised
and
expected
happiness
that
was
certain
to
arrive
during
the
period
of
the
vegetal
labor
at
the
period
separating
the
flower
from
the
fruit
even
before
i
manifested
my
intention
to
do
so
it
already
seems
natural
to
my
brother
that
henceforth
i
should
live
here
in
the
country
with
him
and
our
mother
for
he
said
i
shall
see
the
fruit
of
his
trees
he
is
i
shall
see
them
so
it
is
quite
true
that
a
new
life
has
begun
again
for
me
and
that
my
innate
sensation
does
not
deceive
me
in
fact
everything
now
is
being
accomplished
with
a
strange
unusual
facility
with
an
abundance
of
love
how
i
love
federico
never
have
i
loved
him
so
much
before
such
were
the
soliloquies
that
i
indulged
in
soliloquies
somewhat
disconnected
incoherent
at
times
puerile
because
of
the
singular
disposition
of
soul
that
made
me
recognize
in
no
matter
what
insignificant
fact
a
favorable
sign
a
happy
prognostication
my
keenest
joy
was
in
knowing
myself
to
be
far
removed
from
the
past
far
from
certain
places
and
certain
persons
freed
forever
sometimes
in
order
to
better
enjoy
the
peace
of
this
vernal
country
i
imagined
to
myself
the
space
that
separated
me
now
from
the
shadowy
world
in
which
i
had
suffered
so
many
and
such
culpable
sufferings
sometimes
too
a
confused
fear
seized
me
again
compelled
me
to
restlessly
seek
about
me
the
motives
of
my
present
security
forced
me
to
place
my
arm
on
my
brother
s
arm
and
read
in
his
eyes
the
indubitable
and
protecting
affection
i
had
a
blind
confidence
in
federico
i
should
have
liked
not
only
that
he
should
love
me
but
that
he
should
dominate
me
i
should
have
liked
to
cede
to
him
my
right
as
the
elder
because
he
was
more
worthy
to
submit
to
his
advice
to
have
him
for
a
guide
to
obey
him
at
his
side
i
should
not
have
run
the
peril
of
being
lost
since
he
knew
the
right
way
and
trod
it
with
an
infallible
step
and
more
than
that
he
was
strong
of
arm
he
would
have
defended
me
he
was
the
exemplary
energetic
sagacious
to
me
nothing
equalled
in
nobleness
the
sight
of
his
youth
devoted
to
the
religion
of
to
act
conscientiously
consecrated
to
the
love
of
the
earth
one
would
say
that
his
eyes
in
the
continual
contemplation
of
verdant
nature
had
borrowed
something
of
its
limpid
vegetal
color
jesus
of
the
soil
i
called
him
one
day
smiling
that
was
on
a
morning
pregnant
with
innocence
one
of
those
mornings
that
evoked
the
images
of
primordial
daybreaks
at
the
infancy
of
the
world
my
brother
was
speaking
to
a
group
of
laborers
at
the
edge
of
a
field
he
spoke
standing
taller
by
a
head
than
those
around
him
and
his
calm
gesture
indicated
the
simplicity
of
his
words
old
men
grown
white
in
wisdom
mature
men
already
on
the
confines
of
old
age
were
listening
to
the
young
man
all
bore
on
their
knotty
bodies
the
mark
of
the
great
common
toil
as
there
were
no
trees
in
the
vicinity
and
as
the
wheat
was
low
in
the
furrows
their
attitudes
were
fully
outlined
in
the
sanctity
of
the
light
when
he
saw
that
i
was
coming
towards
him
he
dismissed
his
men
in
order
to
come
forward
to
meet
me
and
then
fell
spontaneously
from
my
lips
this
salutation
jesus
of
the
soil
hosanna
to
every
vegetable
growth
he
paid
infinite
attentions
nothing
escaped
his
penetrating
and
so
to
speak
omnispective
regard
during
our
matinal
walks
he
stopped
at
every
step
to
remove
from
some
leaf
a
snail
a
caterpillar
or
an
ant
one
day
while
carelessly
walking
along
i
struck
the
plants
with
the
end
of
my
stick
and
at
every
blow
the
ends
of
the
verdant
stems
flew
in
all
directions
that
gave
him
pain
since
he
took
the
stick
from
my
hands
but
with
a
gentle
movement
and
he
blushed
thinking
perhaps
that
his
pity
might
seem
to
me
an
exaggeration
of
sickly
sentimentality
oh
that
blush
on
that
manly
face
another
day
as
i
was
breaking
off
a
flowering
branch
from
an
i
surprised
in
federico
s
eyes
a
shadow
of
sorrow
i
stopped
immediately
and
withdrew
my
hands
saying
does
it
displease
you
he
burst
into
a
laugh
not
at
all
not
at
all
you
may
despoil
the
entire
tree
yet
the
broken
branch
held
by
several
live
fibres
hung
down
the
trunk
and
truly
that
wound
moist
with
sap
had
an
appearance
of
a
thing
in
pain
those
fragile
flowers
with
pale
spots
like
bunches
of
simple
roses
grown
from
a
germ
henceforth
condemned
continued
to
thrill
in
the
breeze
then
so
as
to
excuse
the
cruelty
of
my
aggression
i
said
it
is
for
juliana
and
breaking
the
last
live
fibres
i
detached
the
broken
branch
i
carried
this
branch
to
juliana
and
many
others
besides
i
never
returned
to
the
badiola
without
a
load
of
flowered
gifts
one
morning
as
i
was
carrying
a
bunch
of
hawthorns
i
met
my
mother
in
the
vestibule
i
was
somewhat
out
of
breath
heated
disturbed
by
a
slight
intoxication
where
is
juliana
i
asked
upstairs
in
her
room
she
answered
laughing
i
ran
up
the
staircase
crossed
the
corridor
entered
the
room
crying
juliana
juliana
where
are
you
maria
and
natalia
ran
to
meet
me
giving
me
a
boisterous
welcome
delighted
at
the
sight
of
the
flowers
dancing
about
as
if
possessed
come
in
come
in
they
cried
mamma
is
here
in
the
bedroom
come
in
on
crossing
the
threshold
my
heart
beat
faster
juliana
was
there
smiling
and
embarrassed
i
threw
the
bunch
at
her
feet
look
oh
how
beautiful
she
exclaimed
bending
over
the
fragrant
treasure
she
was
dressed
in
one
of
her
favorite
gowns
hanging
in
ample
and
graceful
folds
and
of
a
green
hue
resembling
the
green
of
an
her
hair
not
yet
dressed
covered
the
nape
of
her
neck
hiding
her
ears
beneath
its
thick
masses
the
emanations
from
the
hawthorns
that
odor
of
thyme
mixed
with
bitter
almonds
enveloped
inundated
the
room
penetrating
everything
take
care
not
to
prick
yourself
i
said
to
her
see
my
hands
i
showed
her
the
still
bleeding
lacerations
as
if
to
enhance
the
value
of
my
offering
oh
if
now
she
would
take
my
hands
i
thought
and
in
my
mind
passed
confusedly
the
recollection
of
a
day
far
distant
when
she
had
kissed
my
hands
lacerated
by
the
thorns
when
she
had
wanted
to
suck
the
drops
of
blood
that
appeared
one
after
the
other
if
now
she
would
take
my
hands
and
if
by
this
single
action
she
would
accord
me
full
pardon
and
yield
herself
up
to
me
entirely
at
that
time
i
was
in
constant
expectation
of
some
such
movement
i
could
not
of
course
have
said
what
gave
me
such
confidence
but
i
was
sure
that
juliana
would
give
herself
to
me
again
in
this
manner
sooner
or
later
by
some
simple
and
silent
action
by
which
she
would
accord
me
full
pardon
and
yield
herself
up
to
me
entirely
she
smiled
a
shade
of
suffering
passed
over
her
pale
face
and
in
her
sunken
eyes
don
t
you
feel
a
little
better
since
you
are
here
i
asked
approaching
her
yes
i
m
better
she
answered
then
after
a
pause
and
you
oh
i
i
am
cured
don
t
you
see
yes
it
is
true
at
that
time
when
she
spoke
to
me
her
words
had
a
curious
hesitation
that
seemed
to
me
full
of
grace
but
which
now
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
define
one
would
have
said
that
she
was
continually
preoccupied
in
restraining
the
word
that
rose
to
her
lips
to
pronounce
another
word
moreover
her
voice
was
so
to
speak
more
it
had
lost
its
former
firmness
and
some
of
its
sonorousness
it
was
veiled
like
an
instrument
played
in
secret
but
since
it
had
only
tender
accents
for
me
now
what
obstacle
prevented
us
from
being
all
in
all
to
each
other
again
what
obstacle
maintained
the
separation
between
us
during
that
period
which
in
the
history
of
my
soul
will
ever
remain
mysterious
my
natural
perspicacity
seemed
to
have
deserted
me
all
my
terrible
analytical
faculties
even
those
that
had
made
me
suffer
so
much
seemed
exhausted
the
power
of
these
restless
faculties
appeared
to
be
annihilated
innumerable
sensations
innumerable
feelings
relative
to
that
epoch
are
now
incomprehensible
inexplicable
because
i
have
no
indication
to
aid
me
in
retracing
their
origin
in
determining
their
character
there
was
a
break
in
the
continuity
or
lack
of
solder
between
that
period
of
my
psychic
existence
and
the
other
periods
formerly
i
had
narrated
a
fabulous
tale
in
which
a
young
prince
after
the
adventures
of
a
long
pilgrimage
finally
succeeds
in
rejoining
the
lady
whom
he
had
pursued
with
his
ardent
love
the
young
man
trembled
with
hope
and
the
lady
smiled
on
him
close
by
but
a
veil
seemed
to
render
this
smiling
lady
intangible
a
veil
of
unknown
substance
so
subtle
that
it
was
confounded
with
the
air
and
nevertheless
this
veil
was
a
barrier
that
prohibited
the
young
man
from
clasping
the
woman
he
loved
to
his
heart
this
fable
helps
me
a
little
to
form
an
idea
of
the
singular
state
in
which
i
found
myself
at
that
time
juliana
i
felt
that
between
her
and
me
an
unknown
something
constantly
maintained
an
abyss
but
at
the
same
time
i
was
confident
that
sooner
or
later
the
simple
and
silent
gesture
would
annihilate
the
obstacle
and
bring
back
my
happiness
meanwhile
how
juliana
s
room
pleased
me
it
was
furnished
with
hangings
with
faded
pink
flowers
and
it
had
a
deep
alcove
what
a
perfume
the
hawthorns
shed
this
odor
is
penetrating
she
said
very
pale
it
gives
one
a
headache
don
t
you
feel
it
she
went
and
opened
a
window
then
she
added
maria
call
miss
edith
the
governess
came
in
edith
please
take
these
flowers
to
the
put
them
into
vases
take
care
not
to
prick
yourself
maria
and
natalia
wanted
to
carry
a
part
of
the
bunch
we
remained
alone
she
went
once
more
to
the
window
and
leaned
against
it
her
back
turned
toward
the
light
have
you
anything
to
do
do
you
wish
me
to
go
i
asked
no
no
stay
be
seated
tell
me
about
your
walk
this
morning
how
far
did
you
go
she
spoke
with
some
precipitation
as
the
window
support
was
at
about
the
height
of
her
waist
she
had
placed
her
elbows
on
it
and
her
bust
was
inclined
backward
framed
by
the
rectangle
of
the
window
her
face
turned
directly
toward
me
was
entirely
shaded
particularly
about
the
orbits
of
the
eyes
but
her
hair
on
the
summit
of
which
fell
the
light
formed
a
slight
aureole
the
light
also
touched
the
tops
of
her
shoulders
one
of
her
one
that
supported
the
weight
of
her
raised
drawing
up
the
dress
partly
disclosing
the
stocking
and
the
slipper
in
that
attitude
in
that
light
her
entire
person
possessed
extraordinarily
seductive
power
a
section
of
bluish
and
voluptuous
landscape
pinked
out
between
the
two
formed
a
distant
background
behind
her
head
and
then
instantaneously
as
if
by
a
crushing
revelation
i
saw
once
more
in
her
the
desirable
woman
and
all
my
blood
fired
up
at
the
memory
of
and
the
desire
of
her
caresses
i
spoke
to
her
my
eyes
fixed
on
her
and
the
more
i
gazed
on
her
the
more
disturbed
i
became
she
also
no
doubt
must
have
read
my
look
since
her
uneasiness
became
visible
i
thought
with
poignant
internal
anxiety
if
i
only
dared
if
i
went
closer
to
her
if
i
took
her
in
my
arms
the
apparent
assurance
that
i
sought
to
put
in
my
frivolous
remarks
rapidly
abandoned
me
my
disturbance
grew
my
embarrassment
became
insupportable
from
the
adjoining
rooms
came
the
sound
of
the
voices
of
maria
natalia
and
edith
indistinctly
i
arose
approached
the
window
and
stood
beside
juliana
i
was
on
the
point
of
bending
toward
her
to
speak
at
last
the
words
that
i
had
so
many
times
repeated
to
myself
in
imaginary
conversations
but
the
fear
of
a
probable
interruption
stopped
me
i
thought
that
perhaps
the
moment
was
badly
chosen
that
perhaps
i
should
not
have
the
time
to
say
all
to
her
to
open
all
my
heart
to
her
to
relate
my
intimate
life
during
the
last
few
weeks
the
mysterious
convalescence
of
my
soul
the
awakening
of
my
most
tender
fibres
the
arousing
of
my
most
delicate
dreams
the
depth
of
my
new
sensation
the
tenacity
of
my
hope
i
thought
that
i
should
not
have
the
time
to
recount
in
detail
the
recent
episodes
to
make
those
little
innocent
confessions
to
her
so
delicious
to
the
ear
of
the
woman
who
loves
fresh
with
sincerity
more
persuasive
than
any
eloquence
in
fact
i
must
succeed
in
convincing
her
of
a
great
truth
perhaps
incredible
to
her
after
so
many
disillusions
succeed
in
convincing
her
that
now
my
return
was
no
longer
deceptive
but
sincere
definite
necessitated
by
a
vital
desire
of
my
entire
being
of
course
she
was
still
distrustful
of
course
her
distrust
was
the
cause
of
her
reserve
between
us
the
shadow
of
an
atrocious
recollection
ever
interposed
itself
it
was
for
me
to
banish
this
shadow
to
draw
my
soul
and
hers
so
closely
together
that
nothing
more
could
interpose
between
them
but
for
that
a
favorable
occasion
was
required
in
some
secret
and
silent
place
inhabited
only
by
memories
that
place
was
the
lilacs
we
remained
in
the
embrasure
of
the
window
by
each
other
s
side
both
silent
from
the
adjoining
rooms
came
the
sound
of
the
voices
of
maria
natalia
and
edith
indistinctly
the
perfume
of
the
hawthorn
was
dissipated
the
curtains
that
hung
from
the
arch
of
the
alcove
permitted
a
view
of
the
bed
in
its
depth
and
my
eyes
wandered
ceaselessly
toward
it
searching
the
shadows
almost
concupiscent
juliana
had
lowered
her
head
perhaps
because
she
also
felt
the
delicious
and
agonizing
weight
of
the
silence
the
light
breeze
toyed
with
a
loose
curl
on
her
temple
the
restless
agitation
of
that
dark
curl
in
which
were
light
scattered
threads
of
gold
on
that
temple
white
as
a
wafer
made
me
languorous
and
as
i
gazed
at
her
i
saw
again
on
her
neck
the
little
brown
mole
which
in
former
days
had
so
often
curiously
attracted
me
then
incapable
of
containing
myself
with
a
mixture
of
apprehension
and
hardihood
i
raised
my
hand
to
arrange
the
curl
and
my
fingers
trembled
on
her
hair
and
they
brushed
against
the
ear
the
neck
but
lightly
very
lightly
with
the
most
furtive
of
caresses
what
are
you
doing
said
juliana
shaken
by
a
start
turning
on
me
a
bewildered
look
trembling
perhaps
more
than
i
she
left
the
window
then
feeling
that
i
was
following
her
she
made
several
steps
as
if
to
flee
dismayed
ah
juliana
why
why
i
cried
stopping
short
then
immediately
i
added
it
is
true
i
am
still
unworthy
pardon
at
that
moment
the
two
bells
of
the
chapel
began
to
chime
and
maria
and
natalia
rushed
into
the
room
ran
up
to
their
mother
with
cries
of
joy
and
hung
around
her
neck
one
after
the
other
covering
her
face
with
kisses
then
leaving
their
mother
they
came
to
me
and
i
raised
them
in
my
arms
one
after
the
other
the
two
bells
chimed
furiously
the
whole
of
the
badiola
seemed
to
be
invaded
by
the
thrill
of
the
bronze
it
was
holy
saturday
the
hour
of
the
resurrection
in
the
afternoon
of
that
same
saturday
i
had
a
strange
attack
of
melancholy
the
post
had
arrived
at
the
badiola
and
i
happened
to
be
in
the
with
my
brother
glancing
through
the
newspapers
my
eyes
fell
by
chance
on
the
name
of
filippo
arborio
mentioned
in
an
article
a
sudden
agitation
seized
me
thus
it
is
that
a
slight
jar
will
stir
up
the
dregs
of
a
quiescent
liquid
i
remember
it
was
a
foggy
afternoon
illuminated
by
the
fatigued
reverberation
of
a
whitish
light
outside
before
the
window
looking
on
the
lawn
juliana
passed
with
my
mother
arm
in
arm
chatting
juliana
carried
a
book
and
walked
as
if
fatigued
with
the
incoherence
of
the
images
that
unrolled
before
me
in
thought
there
arose
in
my
mind
certain
remnants
of
my
past
life
juliana
before
the
mirror
on
that
november
day
the
bouquet
of
white
chrysanthemums
my
anxiety
on
hearing
the
air
from
orpheus
the
words
written
on
the
of
the
color
of
juliana
s
dress
my
soliloquy
at
the
window
filippo
arborio
s
face
dripping
with
perspiration
the
scene
in
the
of
the
salle
d
armes
i
thought
with
a
shudder
of
fear
like
a
man
who
suddenly
finds
himself
leaning
over
the
edge
of
a
precipice
can
it
be
possible
that
i
am
lost
overcome
by
anguish
feeling
a
desire
to
be
alone
in
order
to
commune
with
myself
to
meet
my
fear
face
to
face
i
took
leave
of
my
brother
left
the
hall
and
returned
to
my
room
my
agitation
was
mingled
with
impatience
and
anger
i
was
like
a
man
who
in
the
midst
of
the
comfort
of
an
illusory
cure
in
the
full
assurance
of
having
regained
his
health
would
feel
all
at
once
the
sting
of
his
old
malady
would
perceive
that
in
his
flesh
the
ineradicable
disease
still
remained
and
would
be
constrained
to
watch
himself
to
note
his
symptoms
in
order
to
convince
himself
of
the
horrible
truth
can
it
be
possible
that
i
am
lost
and
why
in
the
strange
forgetfulness
in
which
the
entire
past
was
buried
in
that
sort
of
obscurity
which
seemed
to
have
entirely
invaded
one
layer
of
my
conscience
the
doubt
against
juliana
that
odious
doubt
had
also
vanished
was
dissolved
my
soul
had
so
great
a
desire
to
lull
itself
with
illusions
to
believe
and
to
hope
my
mother
s
saintly
hand
in
caressing
juliana
s
hair
had
rekindled
for
me
the
aureole
around
that
head
by
one
of
those
sentimental
errors
frequent
during
the
period
of
weakness
when
i
had
seen
the
two
women
leading
the
same
existence
in
such
sweet
concord
i
had
involved
them
in
the
same
irradiation
of
purity
but
now
a
slight
accidental
fact
a
mere
name
read
by
chance
in
a
journal
the
awakening
of
a
recollection
had
sufficed
to
upset
me
to
frighten
me
to
open
an
abyss
beneath
my
feet
and
i
did
not
dare
sound
the
depths
of
a
resolute
scrutiny
because
my
dream
of
happiness
withheld
me
drew
me
back
clung
to
me
obstinately
i
wavered
at
first
in
an
obscure
and
indefinable
anguish
traversed
at
moments
by
dreadful
glimpses
it
may
be
that
she
is
not
pure
and
then
filippo
arborio
or
another
who
knows
were
i
certain
of
the
sin
could
i
pardon
it
what
sin
what
pardon
you
have
not
the
right
to
judge
her
you
have
not
the
right
to
raise
your
voice
she
has
kept
silent
too
often
now
it
is
your
duty
to
keep
silent
and
your
happiness
the
happiness
that
you
dream
of
is
it
your
own
or
does
it
belong
to
both
of
you
to
both
of
you
of
course
for
the
shadow
of
sorrow
would
suffice
to
obscure
all
your
joys
you
suppose
that
if
you
are
happy
she
will
be
happy
with
your
past
of
constant
misconduct
she
with
her
past
of
constant
martyrdom
the
happiness
that
you
dream
of
has
for
its
only
foundation
the
abolition
of
the
past
why
then
if
she
had
truly
ceased
to
be
pure
would
it
be
impossible
to
throw
a
veil
over
it
or
condone
her
sin
as
you
would
your
own
why
if
she
forgets
should
you
not
forget
yourself
why
if
you
claim
to
be
a
man
without
prejudice
and
completely
freed
from
social
convention
should
you
not
consider
her
also
as
a
woman
in
the
same
state
of
being
such
an
inequality
would
be
perhaps
the
worst
of
your
injustices
but
the
ideal
but
the
ideal
my
own
felicity
would
not
be
possible
except
on
the
condition
of
recognizing
in
juliana
a
creature
absolutely
superior
impeccable
worthy
of
every
adoration
and
it
is
precisely
also
in
the
innate
feeling
of
this
superiority
in
the
consciousness
of
her
personal
moral
greatness
that
she
would
find
the
most
precious
elements
of
her
own
felicity
i
should
not
succeed
in
forgetting
my
own
past
or
hers
because
the
existence
of
this
special
happiness
presupposes
both
the
profligacy
of
my
former
life
and
her
unconquered
and
almost
superhuman
heroism
the
image
of
which
has
always
constrained
my
mind
to
bow
before
it
but
do
you
take
into
account
the
amount
of
egotism
and
high
ideality
that
enters
into
your
dream
do
you
believe
you
merit
that
supreme
prize
happiness
by
what
privilege
so
your
long
misconduct
has
entitled
you
not
to
expiation
but
to
a
reward
i
rose
hastily
to
my
feet
to
cut
short
this
debate
in
brief
it
concerns
only
an
old
suspicion
very
vague
and
awakened
by
chance
this
unreasonable
agitation
will
go
away
i
have
made
a
substance
of
a
shadow
in
two
or
three
days
after
easter
we
will
go
to
the
lilacs
and
then
i
shall
know
i
shall
unquestionably
the
truth
but
is
not
that
profound
and
immutable
melancholy
which
is
in
her
eyes
also
suspicious
that
bewildered
air
that
species
of
continual
preoccupation
which
is
marked
so
heavily
on
her
brow
that
great
fatigue
which
is
revealed
by
certain
attitudes
that
anguish
which
she
can
not
succeed
in
dissimulating
at
your
not
all
that
the
ambiguity
of
such
symptoms
bore
also
a
favorable
interpretation
then
submerged
by
a
flood
of
the
most
violent
pain
i
went
up
to
the
window
with
the
instinctive
desire
of
plunging
into
the
spectacle
of
the
outer
world
to
discover
there
something
that
would
correspond
to
the
state
of
my
revelation
or
an
appeasement
the
sky
was
quite
white
like
a
scaffolding
of
superimposed
veils
between
which
the
air
circulated
producing
large
mobile
folds
one
of
these
veils
seemed
at
times
to
detach
itself
and
approach
the
earth
graze
the
tops
of
the
trees
break
up
be
reduced
to
falling
fragments
undulate
on
the
ground
fade
away
on
the
horizon
the
lines
of
the
heights
were
confusedly
unrolled
disappearing
to
reappear
in
the
fantastic
landscapes
like
a
vista
perceived
in
a
dream
without
reality
a
shadow
covered
the
valley
and
the
assoro
whose
shores
were
invisible
animated
it
with
its
reflections
this
tortuous
river
glistening
in
that
sombre
gulf
beneath
that
slow
and
continued
disaggregation
of
the
sky
attracted
the
attention
and
had
for
the
mind
the
fascination
of
symbolical
things
seemed
to
bear
in
itself
the
occult
sense
of
that
indefinable
spectacle
my
pain
gradually
lost
its
acuteness
became
appeased
and
calm
why
do
you
aspire
with
such
avidity
to
a
happiness
of
which
you
are
not
worthy
why
do
you
base
the
whole
edifice
of
your
future
life
on
an
illusion
why
believe
with
such
blind
faith
in
a
privilege
that
does
not
exist
all
men
perhaps
in
the
course
of
their
lives
encounter
a
decisive
period
in
which
the
most
perspicacious
are
able
to
understand
what
life
should
that
period
you
have
already
met
remember
the
moment
when
the
white
and
faithful
hand
which
offered
you
love
indulgence
peace
dreams
forgetfulness
everything
that
is
good
and
beautiful
trembled
in
the
air
was
extended
toward
you
if
for
the
supreme
offering
bitterness
swelled
my
heart
with
tears
i
leaned
my
elbows
on
the
balustrade
my
hands
to
my
face
and
my
eyes
fixed
on
the
windings
of
the
river
at
the
bottom
of
the
leaden
valley
while
the
scaffolding
of
the
sky
ceaselessly
disaggregated
i
remained
for
several
minutes
under
the
menace
of
an
imminent
punishment
i
felt
that
an
unknown
disaster
was
suspended
above
me
but
suddenly
from
the
room
below
arose
the
sound
of
the
piano
and
instantaneously
that
heavy
oppression
disappeared
and
i
was
seized
by
a
confused
anxiety
in
which
all
the
dreams
every
desire
each
hope
every
regret
remorse
and
terror
were
mingled
anew
with
inconceivable
and
suffocating
rapidity
i
recognized
the
music
it
was
a
without
of
which
juliana
was
very
fond
and
which
miss
edith
often
played
it
was
one
of
those
veiled
yet
profound
melodies
in
which
the
soul
appeared
to
ask
life
with
accents
this
single
question
why
have
you
disappointed
my
expectation
yielding
to
a
kind
of
instinctive
impulse
i
went
out
agitated
traversed
the
corridor
descended
the
staircase
and
stopped
before
the
door
from
which
issued
the
sounds
the
door
was
ajar
i
slipped
in
without
making
any
noise
and
looked
through
the
portières
was
it
juliana
at
first
my
eyes
blinded
by
the
light
were
incapable
of
distinguishing
anything
before
adapting
themselves
to
the
darkness
but
i
was
struck
by
the
penetrating
perfume
of
the
hawthorns
that
odor
of
mingled
thyme
and
fresh
as
country
milk
i
looked
in
the
room
was
poorly
lighted
by
a
greenish
light
that
struggled
in
from
between
the
slats
of
the
venetian
blinds
miss
edith
was
alone
at
the
piano
and
she
continued
to
play
without
noticing
my
presence
the
polished
case
of
the
instrument
glistened
in
the
dark
the
branches
of
hawthorns
made
a
white
spot
in
the
quiet
of
this
retreat
in
this
perfume
emanating
from
the
branches
that
recalled
the
happy
matinal
intoxication
and
juliana
s
smile
and
my
own
fear
the
romance
seemed
more
desolate
than
ever
where
was
juliana
gone
upstairs
still
out
of
doors
i
withdrew
i
went
down
the
other
stairs
i
traversed
the
vestibule
without
meeting
anyone
i
had
an
unconquerable
desire
to
seek
her
to
see
her
i
thought
that
perhaps
it
would
suffice
me
to
be
near
her
in
order
to
recover
my
calmness
to
regain
confidence
on
going
out
on
the
lawn
i
perceived
her
beneath
the
elms
sitting
with
federico
both
smiled
at
me
when
i
came
up
to
them
my
brother
said
smilingly
we
were
speaking
of
you
juliana
thinks
you
will
soon
be
tired
of
the
badiola
if
so
what
will
become
of
our
projects
no
juliana
not
i
replied
making
an
effort
to
recover
my
habitual
ease
but
you
will
see
on
the
contrary
it
is
of
rome
that
i
am
tired
of
everything
i
looked
at
juliana
a
marvellous
change
was
taking
place
in
my
soul
the
sad
things
that
up
to
then
had
oppressed
me
now
faded
away
disappeared
gave
place
to
a
salutary
feeling
that
the
mere
sight
of
her
and
of
my
brother
sufficed
to
awaken
in
me
she
was
seated
in
a
careless
and
nonchalant
attitude
holding
on
her
knees
a
book
that
i
recognized
the
book
that
i
had
given
her
some
days
before
tolstoï
s
and
truly
all
about
her
her
attitude
her
look
breathed
sweetness
and
goodness
and
in
me
an
emotion
was
born
similar
to
that
which
i
should
doubtless
have
felt
if
in
the
same
place
beneath
the
familiar
elms
that
shed
their
dead
flowers
i
had
seen
constance
the
poor
sister
side
by
side
with
federico
the
elms
rained
thousands
of
flowers
at
every
breath
of
the
wind
there
was
in
the
white
light
a
continual
and
very
slow
rain
of
diaphanous
almost
impalpable
pellicles
that
loitered
in
the
air
hesitating
trembling
like
the
wings
of
of
an
indefinable
color
between
green
and
blond
and
whose
incessant
fall
imparted
a
sensation
of
vertigo
they
fell
on
juliana
s
knees
on
her
shoulders
from
time
to
time
she
made
a
movement
to
remove
one
that
had
ensconced
itself
in
her
hair
ah
if
tullio
stays
at
the
badiola
said
federico
addressing
her
we
will
do
great
things
we
will
promulgate
the
new
agrarian
laws
we
will
establish
the
foundations
of
the
new
agricultural
constitution
you
smile
you
also
will
have
your
share
in
our
work
we
will
confide
to
you
the
execution
of
two
or
three
precepts
of
our
decalogue
you
will
work
like
the
others
apropos
tullio
when
shall
we
commence
this
novitiate
your
hands
are
too
white
eh
it
is
not
enough
to
simply
prick
them
with
thorns
he
spoke
gayly
in
his
clear
and
strong
voice
that
immediately
inspired
every
listener
with
a
feeling
of
security
and
confidence
he
spoke
of
his
old
and
new
projects
relative
to
the
interpretation
of
the
primitive
christian
law
on
alimentary
labor
with
a
gravity
of
thought
and
emotion
that
tempered
that
sportive
gayety
with
which
he
protected
himself
as
with
a
veil
of
modesty
against
the
admiration
and
eulogy
of
his
auditors
in
him
all
appeared
simple
easy
spontaneous
this
young
man
by
the
sole
power
of
a
mind
that
illumined
his
inborn
virtue
had
had
for
several
years
already
the
intuition
of
the
social
theory
that
the
moujik
bondareff
inspired
in
leo
tolstoï
at
that
time
he
had
not
the
least
knowledge
of
and
the
great
book
that
had
just
appeared
in
the
east
here
is
a
book
for
you
i
said
to
him
taking
the
volume
from
juliana
s
knees
thanks
lend
it
to
me
i
will
read
it
do
you
like
it
i
asked
juliana
yes
very
much
it
is
sad
and
consoling
at
the
same
time
i
already
love
marie
bolkonsky
and
pierre
besoukhow
too
i
sat
down
near
her
on
a
bench
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
thinking
of
nothing
that
i
had
not
one
precise
thought
but
my
soul
kept
vigil
and
meditated
there
was
a
manifest
contrast
between
the
feeling
that
sprang
from
the
circumstance
from
the
neighboring
objects
and
that
which
corresponded
with
federico
s
words
with
that
book
with
the
names
of
the
characters
whom
juliana
loved
the
time
passed
slowly
and
gently
almost
lazily
in
this
diffused
and
whitish
mist
in
which
the
elms
gradually
shed
their
flowers
the
sound
of
the
piano
reached
us
muffled
unintelligible
rendering
the
light
more
melancholy
cradling
so
to
speak
the
drowsy
atmosphere
absorbed
listening
no
longer
i
opened
the
book
i
turned
the
leaves
at
several
places
and
ran
through
the
beginning
of
several
pages
i
noticed
that
there
were
several
pages
turned
down
at
the
corners
as
if
to
mark
them
on
others
there
were
marks
the
habit
of
the
reader
then
i
wished
to
read
in
turn
curious
almost
anxious
in
the
scene
between
pierre
besoukhow
and
the
unknown
old
man
at
the
torjok
many
passages
were
marked
let
your
spiritual
look
fall
back
on
your
inner
being
ask
yourself
if
you
are
satisfied
with
yourself
at
what
result
have
you
arrived
having
but
your
intelligence
for
a
guide
you
are
young
you
are
rich
you
are
intelligent
what
have
you
done
with
all
these
gifts
are
you
satisfied
with
yourself
and
with
your
life
no
i
have
a
horror
of
it
if
you
have
a
horror
of
it
change
it
purify
yourself
and
in
measure
as
you
transform
yourself
you
will
learn
to
recognize
wisdom
how
have
you
passed
your
existence
in
orgies
in
debauches
in
depravities
receiving
everything
from
society
without
giving
it
anything
what
use
have
you
made
of
the
benefits
of
fortune
what
have
you
done
for
your
have
you
thought
of
your
tens
of
thousands
of
serfs
have
you
assisted
them
morally
or
materially
no
you
have
not
you
have
profited
by
their
labor
in
order
to
live
a
life
of
corruption
have
you
sought
to
employ
yourself
in
the
service
of
your
no
you
have
lived
in
indolence
and
then
you
married
you
accepted
the
responsibility
of
serving
as
a
guide
to
a
young
woman
and
then
instead
of
helping
her
to
find
the
path
of
truth
you
have
plunged
her
into
the
abyss
of
deceit
and
of
misery
again
the
unbearable
load
weighed
me
down
crushed
me
and
it
was
a
more
atrocious
torture
than
that
i
had
already
suffered
because
juliana
s
presence
exasperated
the
crisis
on
the
leaf
the
passage
transcribed
was
marked
by
a
single
pencil
stroke
without
any
doubt
juliana
had
marked
it
thinking
of
me
of
my
misconduct
but
the
last
line
to
whom
did
that
refer
to
me
to
us
had
i
thrown
her
had
she
fallen
into
the
abyss
of
deceit
and
misery
i
feared
that
she
and
federico
would
hear
the
beating
of
my
heart
there
was
another
page
turned
down
with
a
very
pronounced
on
the
death
of
the
princess
lisa
the
eyes
of
the
dead
woman
were
closed
but
her
small
face
had
not
changed
and
she
seemed
constantly
saying
what
have
you
done
to
me
prince
andré
did
not
weep
but
he
felt
his
heart
break
as
he
thought
that
he
was
guilty
of
wrongs
henceforth
irreparable
and
unforgettable
the
old
prince
came
also
and
kissed
one
of
the
frail
waxen
hands
that
lay
crossed
over
one
another
and
one
would
have
thought
that
the
poor
small
face
was
again
repeating
to
him
what
have
you
done
to
me
that
gentle
yet
terrible
question
pierced
me
like
a
dagger
what
have
you
done
to
me
i
kept
my
eyes
fixed
on
the
page
not
daring
to
make
a
movement
to
look
at
juliana
yet
agonized
by
a
desire
to
do
so
and
i
feared
that
both
she
and
federico
might
hear
my
that
they
might
turn
toward
me
to
look
at
me
and
that
they
would
discover
my
agitation
my
agitation
was
so
great
that
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
face
was
distorted
that
i
was
incapable
of
rising
incapable
of
uttering
a
single
syllable
i
threw
a
single
rapid
stealthy
glance
at
juliana
and
her
profile
impressed
itself
on
me
so
strongly
that
i
seemed
to
continue
to
see
her
before
me
on
the
page
beside
the
poor
small
face
of
the
dead
princess
it
was
a
pensive
profile
rendered
graver
by
attention
shaded
by
long
lashes
and
the
lips
tightly
closed
somewhat
depressed
at
the
corners
appeared
as
if
involuntarily
confessing
a
feeling
of
fatigue
and
great
sadness
she
was
listening
to
my
brother
and
my
brother
s
voice
resounded
confusedly
in
my
ears
seemed
to
me
far
off
although
he
was
quite
close
and
all
these
flowers
shed
by
the
elms
that
rained
rained
ceaselessly
all
these
dead
flowers
almost
unreal
almost
bereft
of
being
induced
in
me
an
inexpressible
sensation
as
if
that
psychic
vision
were
transformed
in
me
into
strange
internal
phenomena
as
if
i
had
been
present
at
the
continuous
passage
of
these
thousands
of
impalpable
shadows
in
an
inner
sky
at
the
bottom
of
my
soul
what
have
you
done
to
me
repeated
the
voice
of
the
dead
and
the
living
both
the
one
and
the
other
without
moving
their
lips
what
have
you
done
to
me
what
are
you
reading
tullio
asked
juliana
turning
and
taking
from
my
hands
the
book
which
she
closed
and
replaced
on
her
knees
with
a
sort
of
nervous
impatience
and
immediately
without
pause
as
if
to
remove
all
significance
from
her
action
she
added
why
do
we
not
rejoin
miss
edith
and
have
a
little
music
do
you
hear
her
she
is
playing
i
think
the
funeral
march
for
the
death
of
a
hero
which
you
are
so
fond
of
federico
she
listened
we
all
three
listened
we
heard
several
chords
in
the
silence
she
was
not
mistaken
rising
she
added
well
come
will
you
i
rose
last
so
to
have
her
before
me
she
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
shake
from
her
dress
the
elm
flowers
that
had
formed
a
soft
carpet
on
the
ground
all
around
she
stood
still
a
minute
her
head
bent
regarding
the
layer
of
flowers
which
she
hollowed
out
and
piled
up
with
the
slender
tip
of
her
shoe
while
on
her
other
flowers
and
still
other
flowers
continued
to
rain
to
rain
ceaselessly
i
could
see
nothing
of
her
face
was
she
really
so
attentive
to
that
trifling
action
or
was
she
not
rather
absorbed
in
perplexity
the
following
morning
among
those
who
brought
easter
offerings
to
the
badiola
came
calisto
old
calisto
the
keeper
at
the
lilacs
with
an
enormous
bouquet
of
fresh
and
odorous
lilacs
he
wanted
to
offer
them
to
juliana
with
his
own
hands
recalling
to
her
the
happy
time
of
our
stay
there
and
begging
for
another
visit
a
short
visit
signora
had
seemed
so
gay
so
happy
over
there
why
did
she
not
return
the
house
had
remained
intact
nothing
had
been
changed
the
garden
was
now
more
filled
the
a
veritable
forest
were
in
full
bloom
did
not
their
perfume
reach
as
far
as
the
badiola
toward
evening
really
the
garden
and
the
house
expected
a
visit
beneath
the
roof
all
the
old
nests
were
full
of
swallows
in
deference
to
signora
s
wish
these
nests
had
been
respected
as
if
sacred
but
assuredly
there
were
too
many
now
every
week
they
were
obliged
to
clean
up
the
balconies
and
with
a
shovel
and
what
a
warbling
from
morning
till
night
when
will
signora
decide
to
come
soon
shall
we
go
there
on
tuesday
i
asked
juliana
after
a
slight
hesitation
sustaining
with
the
greatest
difficulty
the
heavy
care
that
bowed
her
head
she
answered
we
ll
go
on
tuesday
if
you
wish
very
well
tuesday
then
calisto
i
said
to
the
old
man
in
such
a
happy
tone
that
i
was
surprised
at
it
myself
so
sudden
and
spontaneous
had
been
the
rapture
of
my
soul
expect
us
tuesday
morning
we
will
bring
our
lunch
make
no
preparations
do
you
understand
let
the
house
remain
closed
i
wish
to
open
the
door
myself
and
to
open
the
windows
myself
one
after
the
other
do
you
understand
a
strange
happiness
without
a
single
cloud
agitated
me
urged
me
on
to
puerile
actions
and
puerile
and
almost
foolish
remarks
that
i
could
hardly
restrain
i
should
have
liked
to
embrace
calisto
to
stroke
his
fine
white
beard
take
him
in
my
arms
speak
to
him
of
the
lilacs
of
the
past
of
the
good
old
time
in
a
prolixity
of
words
under
the
grand
easter
sun
once
more
i
see
before
me
a
simple
sincere
man
a
faithful
heart
i
thought
regarding
him
and
once
more
i
felt
security
as
if
the
affection
of
this
old
man
were
for
me
a
second
talisman
against
the
blows
of
fate
once
more
since
the
close
of
the
preceding
evening
my
soul
expanded
stimulated
by
the
abundance
of
joy
that
impregnated
the
atmosphere
that
emanated
from
every
being
that
morning
one
would
have
thought
that
the
badiola
was
the
shrine
of
a
pilgrimage
not
one
peasant
failed
to
bring
his
offering
and
my
mother
received
upon
her
blessed
hands
a
thousand
kisses
of
men
women
and
children
at
the
mass
that
was
celebrated
in
the
chapel
a
dense
crowd
was
present
it
overflowed
the
porch
and
spread
over
the
lawn
full
of
religious
zeal
beneath
the
azure
vault
the
silver
bells
rang
merrily
in
the
still
air
with
joyous
almost
melodic
harmony
on
the
tower
the
inscription
on
the
sundial
said
est
and
on
this
glorious
morning
on
which
one
felt
so
to
speak
all
the
gratitude
due
to
long
kindness
mounting
toward
the
sweet
maternal
house
these
three
words
seemed
like
a
chant
how
then
could
i
retain
my
perfidious
doubt
suspicions
troubled
recollections
what
could
i
have
to
fear
after
having
seen
my
mother
press
her
lips
on
juliana
s
smiling
brow
after
having
seen
my
brother
press
in
his
noble
and
loyal
hand
the
delicate
and
pale
hand
of
her
who
was
for
him
a
second
incarnation
of
constance
the
thought
of
the
excursion
to
the
lilacs
occupied
me
all
that
day
and
again
the
day
following
without
interruption
never
i
think
had
the
longing
for
the
hour
agreed
upon
for
a
first
rendezvous
filled
me
with
such
ardent
impatience
the
disturbance
of
the
senses
contributed
also
to
enshroud
and
dull
my
conscience
i
wanted
to
reconquer
juliana
body
and
soul
the
name
of
the
lilacs
reawakened
in
me
memories
recollections
not
only
of
a
sweet
idyll
but
also
of
ardent
passion
without
being
aware
of
it
i
had
perhaps
sharpened
my
longing
by
the
inevitable
images
that
suspicion
engenders
it
was
a
latent
poison
that
i
bore
in
me
up
to
then
in
fact
it
had
seemed
to
me
that
my
dominant
emotion
was
entirely
spiritual
and
in
the
expectation
of
the
great
day
i
had
taken
delight
in
imagining
the
conversation
that
i
would
hold
with
the
woman
whose
pardon
i
wished
to
obtain
now
on
the
contrary
what
i
saw
was
less
the
pathetic
scene
that
would
take
place
between
us
than
the
scene
that
must
be
the
immediate
consequence
gradually
by
a
rapid
and
irresistible
elimination
a
single
image
excluded
all
the
others
invaded
me
mastered
me
became
fixed
clear
precise
in
the
smallest
particulars
it
is
after
lunch
a
small
glass
of
chablis
has
sufficed
to
disturb
juliana
who
does
not
drink
wine
so
to
speak
the
afternoon
becomes
warmer
and
warmer
the
odor
of
the
roses
of
the
of
the
lilacs
become
violent
the
swallows
pass
and
repass
with
a
deafening
twittering
we
are
alone
both
invaded
by
an
unbearable
internal
tremor
and
suddenly
i
say
to
her
shall
we
go
and
look
at
our
old
room
it
is
the
old
nuptial
chamber
that
intentionally
i
had
omitted
to
open
during
our
first
walk
through
the
villa
we
enter
there
is
a
low
humming
noticeable
the
same
humming
that
one
thinks
one
hears
in
the
deep
folds
of
certain
shells
but
it
is
only
the
murmur
of
my
arteries
she
also
no
doubt
hears
this
humming
but
it
is
only
the
murmur
of
her
arteries
all
around
is
silent
one
would
think
that
the
swallows
have
ceased
warbling
i
want
to
speak
and
at
my
first
word
that
sticks
in
my
throat
she
falls
into
my
arms
almost
fainting
this
imaginary
picture
became
ceaselessly
more
and
more
embellished
grew
complicated
simulated
the
reality
attained
an
incredible
actuality
i
could
not
succeed
in
preventing
its
absolute
empire
over
my
mind
one
would
have
said
that
there
was
reborn
in
me
the
libertine
so
keen
was
my
pleasure
in
contemplating
and
caressing
the
vision
the
kind
of
life
i
had
led
for
several
weeks
in
this
warm
springtime
produced
its
effect
on
my
regenerated
organism
simple
physiological
phenomena
completely
modified
the
state
of
my
conscience
gave
an
entirely
different
turn
to
my
thoughts
made
of
me
another
man
maria
and
natalia
had
expressed
a
desire
to
accompany
us
on
this
excursion
juliana
wanted
them
to
come
but
i
objected
and
i
used
all
my
skill
every
persuasion
to
accomplish
my
purpose
federico
had
made
this
proposition
i
must
go
to
casal
caldore
on
tuesday
i
will
accompany
you
in
the
carriage
as
far
as
the
lilacs
where
you
will
stop
and
i
will
continue
on
my
way
then
in
the
evening
i
will
call
for
you
again
with
the
carriage
and
we
will
return
together
to
the
badiola
juliana
consented
in
my
presence
i
reflected
that
federico
s
company
at
least
in
going
would
not
inconvenience
us
on
the
contrary
it
would
even
spare
me
a
certain
embarrassment
in
fact
what
could
we
have
spoken
about
juliana
and
i
had
we
been
alone
during
the
two
or
three
hours
the
ride
lasted
what
attitude
could
i
have
taken
toward
her
who
knows
even
if
i
should
not
have
spoiled
the
situation
compromised
its
success
or
at
least
removed
the
freshness
from
our
emotion
was
it
not
my
dream
to
find
myself
again
suddenly
with
her
at
the
lilacs
as
if
by
magic
and
there
to
speak
to
her
my
first
word
of
tenderness
and
submission
the
presence
of
federico
furnished
the
advantage
of
avoiding
uncertain
preliminaries
long
and
painful
silences
sentences
spoken
in
low
tones
on
account
of
the
coachman
s
ears
in
a
word
all
the
little
irritations
and
tortures
we
would
get
down
at
the
lilacs
and
then
then
only
we
should
find
ourselves
by
each
other
s
side
at
the
gate
of
the
lost
paradise
this
is
what
took
place
i
can
not
find
words
to
describe
the
sensation
i
felt
when
i
heard
the
sound
of
the
bells
and
the
noise
of
the
carriage
which
bore
federico
away
in
the
direction
of
casal
caldore
i
said
to
calisto
as
i
took
the
keys
from
his
hands
with
manifest
impatience
now
you
may
go
i
will
call
you
later
and
i
myself
closed
the
gate
behind
the
old
man
who
seemed
rather
surprised
and
dissatisfied
at
so
unceremonious
a
dismissal
at
last
we
re
here
i
cried
directly
i
was
alone
with
juliana
and
the
entire
wave
of
happiness
that
had
invaded
me
passed
into
my
voice
i
was
happy
happy
unspeakably
happy
i
was
as
if
fascinated
by
an
immense
hallucination
of
unexpected
unhoped
for
happiness
that
transfigured
all
my
being
reawoke
and
multiplied
all
that
there
was
still
good
and
youthful
in
me
isolated
me
from
the
world
instantly
concentrated
my
life
within
the
circuit
of
the
walls
enclosed
by
that
garden
words
sprang
to
my
lips
without
connection
inexpressible
my
reason
wandered
in
a
blazing
flash
of
thoughts
how
was
it
that
juliana
had
not
guessed
what
was
passing
in
me
how
was
it
she
had
not
understood
me
how
was
it
that
her
heart
had
not
received
the
of
my
impetuous
joy
we
looked
at
each
other
i
can
still
see
the
anxious
expression
of
her
face
over
which
hovered
an
indefinable
smile
she
spoke
in
that
muffled
feeble
voice
always
hesitating
with
the
singular
hesitation
that
i
had
already
remarked
in
other
circumstances
and
that
made
her
appear
to
be
ceaselessly
preoccupied
in
restraining
the
words
that
mounted
to
her
lips
in
order
to
substitute
for
them
other
words
she
said
let
us
take
a
walk
round
the
garden
before
opening
the
house
how
long
it
is
since
i
have
seen
it
in
such
flower
the
last
time
we
were
here
was
three
years
ago
do
you
remember
it
was
also
in
april
during
easter
week
without
doubt
she
wished
to
overcome
her
agitation
but
she
could
not
succeed
without
doubt
she
wished
to
repress
the
effusion
of
her
tenderness
but
she
could
not
in
this
place
the
first
words
issued
from
her
own
mouth
had
begun
to
evoke
memories
after
a
few
steps
she
stopped
and
we
looked
at
each
other
an
indefinable
change
as
if
she
were
forcing
herself
to
stifle
something
passed
through
her
dark
eyes
juliana
i
cried
incapable
of
controlling
myself
feeling
an
afflux
of
passionate
and
tender
words
spring
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
seized
by
a
mad
frenzy
to
kneel
before
her
on
the
sand
to
embrace
her
knees
to
kiss
her
dress
her
hands
her
wrists
furiously
ceaselessly
with
a
supplicating
gesture
she
made
a
motion
for
me
to
be
quiet
and
she
continued
to
advance
along
the
path
hastening
her
steps
she
wore
a
dress
trimmed
with
darker
shades
a
gray
felt
hat
and
carried
a
parasol
embroidered
with
white
trefoils
i
still
see
her
walking
between
the
tufted
masses
of
lilacs
that
bent
toward
her
their
thousands
of
bunches
it
was
hardly
eleven
o
clock
the
morning
was
warm
a
precocious
warmth
in
the
azure
floated
a
number
of
flocculent
vapors
the
charming
bushes
that
had
given
their
name
to
this
blossomed
on
every
side
were
masters
of
the
garden
formed
a
wood
interspersed
here
and
there
by
bushes
and
by
the
tufts
of
the
here
and
there
the
roses
climbed
up
stalks
insinuated
themselves
between
the
branches
fell
back
again
in
chains
in
garlands
festoons
bouquets
at
the
foot
of
the
stalks
florentine
orris
sprang
from
between
their
leaves
like
long
greenish
swords
flowers
of
large
and
noble
design
the
three
perfumes
harmonized
in
a
deep
accord
that
i
because
since
the
now
distant
epoch
these
had
remained
in
my
memory
as
clearly
as
the
accord
of
three
musical
notes
in
the
silence
only
the
warbling
of
the
swallows
could
be
heard
the
house
could
scarcely
be
seen
between
the
cones
of
the
cypresses
and
the
swallows
were
as
numerous
there
as
bees
around
a
hive
very
soon
juliana
slowed
down
her
pace
i
walked
at
her
side
so
near
that
at
times
our
elbows
touched
she
glanced
attentively
around
her
as
if
she
feared
something
might
escape
her
two
or
three
times
i
detected
on
her
lips
a
movement
as
if
she
were
about
to
speak
it
was
like
the
first
outline
of
a
word
that
remained
unpronounced
i
said
to
her
in
a
low
voice
and
timidly
of
what
are
you
thinking
i
am
thinking
that
we
should
never
have
left
here
you
are
right
juliana
at
times
the
swallows
almost
brushed
against
us
with
a
cry
rapid
and
glistening
like
winged
arrows
how
much
i
have
longed
for
this
day
juliana
ah
you
will
never
know
how
much
i
have
longed
for
it
i
cried
prey
to
an
emotion
so
strong
that
my
voice
became
almost
unrecognizable
never
do
you
understand
never
have
i
felt
an
anxiety
equal
to
that
which
devours
me
since
the
day
before
yesterday
since
the
moment
you
consented
to
come
here
do
you
remember
the
day
when
for
the
first
time
we
saw
each
other
in
secret
on
the
terrace
of
the
villa
oggeri
where
we
kissed
each
other
i
was
mad
with
love
for
you
do
you
remember
well
the
expectation
of
the
last
night
was
nothing
in
comparison
you
do
not
believe
me
and
you
are
right
in
misbelieving
me
in
doubting
me
but
i
want
to
tell
you
all
to
recount
my
sufferings
my
fears
my
hope
oh
i
know
my
sufferings
are
doubtless
little
in
comparison
with
those
that
i
have
made
you
suffer
i
know
i
know
all
my
pains
are
not
equal
to
your
pains
not
worth
your
tears
i
have
not
expiated
my
fault
and
i
am
not
worthy
of
pardon
but
tell
me
tell
me
that
i
may
hope
that
you
will
pardon
me
you
do
not
believe
me
but
i
wish
to
tell
you
all
it
is
you
you
only
whom
i
have
truly
loved
it
is
you
alone
whom
i
love
i
know
i
know
men
will
say
these
things
in
order
to
obtain
pardon
and
you
are
right
not
to
believe
me
yet
see
if
you
think
of
our
love
of
long
ago
if
you
think
of
our
first
three
years
of
tenderness
if
you
remember
if
you
recollect
you
will
see
it
is
impossible
to
refuse
to
believe
me
even
in
my
lowest
abasements
you
were
to
be
for
me
unforgettable
and
my
soul
ever
longed
to
turn
toward
you
to
seek
you
to
regret
you
always
do
you
understand
always
did
you
not
perceive
it
yourself
when
you
were
as
a
sister
to
me
did
you
not
sometimes
perceive
that
i
was
dying
of
sorrow
i
swear
to
you
that
far
away
from
you
i
never
felt
sincere
joy
i
have
never
had
one
hour
of
complete
forgetfulness
never
never
i
swear
it
you
were
my
constant
profound
secret
adoration
the
better
part
of
myself
has
always
been
yours
and
there
has
been
in
me
a
hope
that
has
never
been
of
being
able
to
free
myself
from
my
malady
and
to
find
intact
my
first
my
only
love
ah
juliana
tell
me
that
i
have
not
hoped
in
vain
she
walked
with
extreme
slowness
no
longer
looking
before
her
her
head
bent
excessively
pale
a
slight
painful
contraction
appeared
at
times
at
the
corner
of
her
mouth
and
because
she
remained
silent
i
began
to
feel
a
vague
uneasiness
arise
within
me
an
oppressive
feeling
began
to
be
caused
by
the
sun
the
flowers
the
cries
of
the
swallows
by
all
the
joyfulness
displayed
by
triumphant
springtime
you
do
not
answer
me
i
continued
taking
the
hand
that
she
let
hang
by
her
side
you
do
not
believe
me
you
have
lost
all
confidence
in
me
you
still
fear
that
i
deceive
you
you
do
not
dare
to
give
yourself
up
again
because
you
are
always
thinking
of
last
yes
it
is
true
that
was
the
most
brutal
of
all
my
infamies
i
repent
it
as
i
would
a
crime
and
even
if
you
should
pardon
me
i
shall
never
be
able
to
forgive
myself
but
did
you
not
notice
that
i
was
ailing
that
i
was
losing
my
reason
a
curse
pursued
me
and
since
that
day
i
have
not
had
one
minute
s
respite
i
have
not
had
a
single
lucid
interval
do
you
not
remember
do
you
not
remember
surely
you
knew
i
was
beside
myself
in
a
state
of
madness
for
you
looked
at
me
as
one
does
upon
a
madman
how
often
have
i
surprised
in
your
glances
sad
compassion
curiosity
fear
do
you
not
remember
what
i
had
become
i
was
unrecognizable
well
i
am
cured
i
saved
myself
for
your
sake
i
have
succeeded
in
opening
my
eyes
i
have
succeeded
in
seeing
the
light
at
last
it
is
light
it
is
you
you
only
whom
i
have
truly
loved
all
my
life
it
is
you
only
whom
i
love
do
you
hear
i
pronounced
the
last
words
in
a
firmer
voice
and
more
slowly
as
if
to
impress
them
one
by
one
upon
this
woman
s
soul
and
i
pressed
firmly
her
hand
which
i
already
held
in
my
own
she
stopped
with
the
manner
of
one
about
to
collapse
gasping
later
only
later
during
the
hours
that
followed
i
understood
the
excess
of
mortal
anguish
exhaled
by
this
panting
but
at
that
moment
i
understood
only
this
the
recollection
of
my
horrible
treason
evoked
by
me
revives
her
suffering
i
have
touched
wounds
that
are
still
open
ah
if
i
could
persuade
her
to
believe
me
if
i
could
conquer
her
distrust
does
not
my
voice
convince
her
that
i
am
speaking
the
truth
we
had
come
to
the
intersection
of
two
paths
there
was
a
bench
there
she
murmured
let
us
sit
down
a
little
we
sat
down
i
do
not
know
if
she
recognized
the
spot
even
i
did
not
recognize
it
at
first
bewildered
like
a
man
who
has
had
both
his
eyes
bandaged
for
some
time
we
both
looked
about
us
then
we
looked
at
one
another
and
in
our
eyes
we
had
the
same
thought
a
crowd
of
tender
recollections
were
connected
with
this
old
stone
bench
my
heart
swelled
not
with
regret
but
with
a
restless
covetousness
with
a
sort
of
frenzy
of
living
that
in
a
flash
gave
me
a
chimerical
dazzling
vision
of
the
future
ah
she
is
ignorant
of
what
new
tenderness
i
am
capable
in
my
soul
there
is
a
paradise
for
her
and
the
flaming
up
of
that
ideal
of
love
was
so
strong
that
i
became
exalted
are
you
sad
but
what
creature
in
all
the
world
was
ever
loved
as
i
love
you
to
what
woman
has
it
been
given
to
obtain
a
proof
of
love
equal
to
that
i
give
you
you
said
just
now
we
should
never
have
left
without
doubt
we
should
have
been
happy
you
would
not
have
suffered
a
martyrdom
you
would
not
have
shed
so
many
tears
you
would
not
have
lost
so
many
years
of
your
life
but
you
would
not
have
known
my
love
all
my
love
her
head
was
bent
on
her
bosom
her
eyes
and
she
listened
motionless
her
eyelashes
threw
on
the
upper
part
of
her
cheeks
a
shadow
that
disturbed
me
more
than
a
look
would
have
done
and
i
myself
would
have
had
no
knowledge
of
my
love
did
i
not
believe
the
first
time
i
left
you
that
all
was
at
an
end
i
sought
another
passion
another
fever
another
intoxication
i
wished
to
embrace
life
in
one
single
clasp
you
did
not
suffice
me
and
during
all
those
years
i
weakened
myself
by
an
atrocious
life
oh
so
atrocious
that
i
have
a
horror
of
it
as
a
convict
has
a
horror
of
the
prison
in
which
he
has
lived
a
little
every
and
i
had
to
wander
from
darkness
into
darkness
before
light
fell
on
my
soul
before
this
great
truth
appeared
to
me
i
have
loved
only
one
woman
and
you
are
she
you
alone
in
all
the
world
are
good
and
gentle
and
you
are
the
best
and
most
gentle
creature
i
have
ever
dreamed
of
you
are
the
unique
and
you
were
in
my
house
while
i
sought
you
afar
off
do
you
understand
now
do
you
understand
were
in
my
house
while
i
sought
you
afar
ah
tell
me
is
not
this
confession
worth
all
your
tears
do
you
not
wish
you
had
shed
more
much
more
in
order
to
purchase
this
certitude
yes
still
more
she
said
so
low
that
i
scarcely
heard
her
the
words
passed
like
a
breath
from
her
pallid
lips
and
the
tears
gushed
from
between
her
eyelashes
rolled
down
her
cheeks
wetted
the
convulsed
mouth
fell
on
that
palpitating
bosom
juliana
my
love
oh
my
love
i
cried
with
a
thrill
of
supreme
felicity
throwing
myself
on
my
knees
before
her
and
i
threw
my
arms
around
her
i
laid
my
head
on
her
bosom
i
felt
again
in
all
my
being
that
frenetic
tension
in
which
ends
useless
effort
to
express
by
an
action
by
a
gesture
by
a
caress
the
inexpressible
internal
passion
her
tears
fell
on
my
cheek
if
the
material
effect
of
these
warm
had
equalled
the
sensations
that
i
received
from
them
i
should
carry
an
indelible
mark
on
my
skin
oh
let
me
drink
i
begged
raising
myself
i
placed
my
lips
to
her
eyelids
and
i
bathed
them
with
her
tears
while
my
hands
lavished
on
her
distracted
caresses
my
limbs
had
acquired
an
extraordinary
flexibility
a
sort
of
illusory
fluidity
that
prevented
me
from
noticing
the
obstacle
presented
by
the
clothes
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
the
power
to
enclose
and
envelop
the
entire
person
of
the
loved
one
did
you
dream
i
said
with
the
saline
savor
in
my
mouth
that
impregnated
me
to
the
heart
later
during
the
hours
that
followed
i
was
astonished
at
not
having
found
an
intolerable
bitterness
in
these
tears
did
you
dream
you
would
be
loved
so
much
did
you
dream
of
such
happiness
it
is
i
look
it
is
i
who
speak
to
you
like
this
look
well
it
is
i
if
you
knew
how
strange
that
seems
to
me
if
i
could
tell
you
i
know
that
i
do
not
know
you
from
i
know
i
do
not
love
you
from
i
know
that
you
are
what
you
have
always
been
and
yet
it
seems
to
me
that
i
only
just
found
you
a
moment
ago
when
you
said
yes
still
you
said
it
did
you
not
only
three
breath
and
i
am
reborn
and
you
are
reborn
and
we
will
be
happy
happy
forever
i
told
her
these
things
in
a
voice
that
seemed
to
come
from
a
distance
broken
indefinable
in
one
of
those
tones
whose
intonations
seem
to
rise
to
our
lips
not
from
our
material
organs
but
from
the
deepest
depths
of
our
soul
and
she
who
up
to
then
had
shed
silent
tears
burst
into
sobs
violent
too
violent
were
her
sobs
not
as
when
one
succumbs
to
a
limitless
joy
but
when
one
gives
vent
to
inconsolable
despair
she
sobbed
so
violently
that
for
several
seconds
i
was
seized
by
the
stupor
caused
by
excessive
manifestations
supreme
paroxysms
of
human
emotions
unconsciously
i
drew
back
a
little
but
immediately
i
noticed
the
distance
that
now
separated
us
i
at
once
noticed
not
only
that
there
was
no
longer
a
physical
contact
but
also
that
the
sensation
of
moral
communion
had
become
dissipated
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
we
were
still
two
beings
distinct
separate
external
to
one
another
the
very
difference
of
our
attitudes
even
accentuated
this
disunion
sitting
back
at
her
end
of
the
bench
and
covering
her
face
with
her
two
hands
she
sobbed
and
every
one
of
her
sobs
shook
her
entire
being
put
in
evidence
her
fragility
so
to
speak
without
touching
her
i
was
again
on
my
knees
before
her
and
i
looked
at
her
stupefied
and
yet
strangely
lucid
attentive
to
all
that
was
passing
within
me
and
yet
with
every
sense
open
to
the
perception
of
surrounding
objects
i
heard
both
her
sobs
and
the
twittering
of
the
swallows
i
had
an
exact
notion
of
time
and
place
and
those
flowers
and
those
perfumes
and
the
surrounding
glory
of
the
joyous
springtime
inspired
me
with
a
fright
that
grew
and
grew
becoming
a
sort
of
panicky
terror
an
instinctive
and
blind
terror
against
which
reason
was
powerless
and
like
a
thunderbolt
that
lights
up
a
bank
of
clouds
one
thought
flashed
out
from
the
midst
of
this
tumultuous
fear
illuminated
me
struck
me
to
the
heart
she
is
impure
ah
why
did
i
not
fall
then
struck
dead
by
the
blow
why
did
not
one
of
my
vital
organs
collapse
why
did
i
not
expire
at
the
feet
of
the
woman
who
in
a
few
short
moments
had
raised
me
to
the
height
of
happiness
only
to
precipitate
me
into
an
abyss
of
misery
answer
i
seized
her
wrists
i
uncovered
her
face
i
spoke
close
to
her
and
my
voice
was
so
low
that
i
scarcely
heard
it
myself
in
the
tumult
of
my
brain
answer
what
do
these
tears
signify
she
ceased
to
sob
and
looked
at
me
and
her
eyes
reddened
by
the
tears
became
dilated
with
an
expression
of
supreme
anguish
as
if
they
had
seen
me
dying
in
fact
my
face
must
have
seemed
lifeless
is
too
late
perhaps
is
it
too
late
i
added
revealing
my
terrible
thought
by
this
obscure
question
no
no
tullio
what
could
you
have
thought
no
no
i
am
so
weak
you
see
i
am
no
longer
what
i
was
formerly
i
have
no
strength
i
am
ill
you
know
i
am
so
ill
i
have
not
had
the
force
to
resist
your
words
you
understand
this
crisis
has
come
to
me
so
unexpectedly
it
is
my
sort
of
convulsion
when
one
has
a
spasm
like
this
one
can
not
distinguish
whether
it
is
from
joy
or
sorrow
oh
my
god
see
it
is
passing
rise
tullio
come
here
by
my
side
she
spoke
to
me
in
a
voice
still
choked
by
tears
still
broken
with
sobs
she
looked
at
me
with
an
expression
that
was
well
known
to
me
the
expression
that
she
had
already
often
had
at
the
sight
of
my
suffering
at
one
time
she
could
not
bear
to
see
me
suffer
her
sensibility
to
this
was
so
exaggerated
that
i
could
obtain
anything
from
her
by
showing
her
that
i
was
sad
she
would
have
done
anything
to
free
me
from
pain
even
the
slightest
often
at
that
time
i
feigned
pain
in
jest
to
make
her
uneasy
so
as
to
be
consoled
like
a
child
to
obtain
certain
caresses
that
pleased
me
to
call
forth
certain
graceful
gestures
that
i
adored
was
it
not
the
same
tender
yet
alarmed
expression
that
reappeared
now
in
her
eyes
come
here
by
my
side
sit
down
or
would
you
prefer
to
continue
our
walk
in
the
garden
we
have
seen
nothing
yet
let
us
go
toward
the
fountain
i
would
like
to
bathe
my
eyes
why
do
you
look
at
me
so
of
what
are
you
thinking
are
we
not
happy
see
i
begin
to
feel
well
again
very
well
but
i
must
bathe
my
eyes
my
face
what
time
is
it
noon
perhaps
federico
will
be
back
at
about
six
o
clock
we
have
plenty
of
time
will
you
come
she
spoke
in
a
broken
and
still
somewhat
convulsive
voice
and
with
a
manifest
effort
as
if
trying
to
collect
herself
to
regain
command
of
her
nervousness
to
dissipate
in
me
the
shadow
of
an
apprehension
to
appear
to
me
confiding
and
happy
the
smile
that
trembled
in
her
still
humid
and
somewhat
reddened
eyes
had
a
troubled
gentleness
that
awakened
my
sympathy
i
felt
in
her
words
in
her
attitude
in
all
her
person
that
gentleness
that
softened
me
that
made
me
languish
with
a
languor
is
impossible
for
me
to
define
the
delicate
seduction
that
emanating
from
this
creature
insinuated
itself
in
my
senses
and
in
my
mind
favored
by
the
indefinable
and
confused
state
of
my
soul
she
seemed
to
be
silently
saying
to
me
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
be
more
adorable
take
me
then
since
you
love
me
take
me
in
your
arms
but
carefully
without
hurting
me
without
clasping
me
too
hard
oh
i
burn
with
desire
to
receive
your
caresses
but
i
believe
they
would
kill
me
this
thought
aided
me
a
little
to
counteract
the
effect
her
smile
produced
upon
me
i
looked
at
her
mouth
at
the
moment
she
asked
me
why
do
you
look
at
me
like
that
and
at
the
moment
when
she
asked
are
we
not
happy
i
felt
the
blind
desire
of
an
awakened
sensation
in
which
died
away
the
uneasy
feeling
which
my
recent
passion
had
left
in
me
when
she
arose
i
seized
her
impetuously
in
my
arms
and
fastened
my
lips
to
hers
it
was
a
lover
s
kiss
that
i
gave
her
a
kiss
long
and
deep
that
stirred
all
the
essence
of
our
two
beings
she
sank
back
on
the
bench
exhausted
oh
no
no
tullio
i
beg
of
you
enough
enough
let
me
regain
a
little
strength
she
begged
stretching
her
hands
out
to
push
me
away
otherwise
i
shall
be
unable
to
keep
on
my
feet
see
i
am
half
dead
but
there
had
sprung
up
in
me
extraordinary
phenomena
that
sensation
had
had
the
same
effect
on
my
mind
as
an
impetuous
wave
that
sweeps
away
all
obstacles
effaces
every
imprint
and
leaves
the
sand
smooth
everything
was
instantly
levelled
and
suddenly
i
found
myself
in
anew
state
determined
by
the
immediate
influence
of
circumstances
by
the
pressure
of
the
blood
which
began
to
tingle
i
no
longer
knew
but
one
thing
i
had
there
before
me
the
woman
whom
i
desired
trembling
overwhelmed
by
my
short
mine
entirely
around
us
blossomed
a
garden
filled
with
memories
filled
with
secrets
a
deserted
house
awaits
us
behind
the
flowering
bushes
guarded
by
the
familiar
swallows
do
you
think
i
am
not
strong
enough
to
carry
you
i
said
to
her
seizing
her
hands
interlacing
my
fingers
in
hers
you
used
to
be
as
light
as
a
feather
now
you
must
be
still
lighter
let
us
try
a
dark
shadow
passed
in
her
eyes
for
a
second
she
seemed
absorbed
in
thought
as
when
one
deliberates
and
takes
a
rapid
resolution
then
she
shook
her
head
and
throwing
herself
back
hanging
to
me
by
her
outstretched
arms
laughing
with
a
laugh
that
revealed
a
little
of
her
bloodless
gum
very
well
lift
me
she
said
scarcely
had
she
risen
than
she
fell
against
my
breast
and
then
it
was
she
who
kissed
me
first
with
a
sort
of
convulsive
furor
as
if
a
prey
to
a
sudden
frenzy
as
if
she
wished
at
one
stroke
to
appease
an
atrociously
painful
thirst
ah
it
is
killing
me
she
repeated
when
our
lips
had
parted
and
that
humid
mouth
somewhat
projecting
that
had
become
redder
animated
by
languor
in
that
face
so
pale
and
frail
really
gave
me
the
indefinable
impression
that
of
all
that
body
similar
to
a
corpse
the
lips
only
were
alive
she
murmured
dreamily
raising
her
closed
eyes
the
long
lashes
of
which
trembled
as
if
a
slight
smile
had
filtered
out
from
beneath
the
lids
are
you
happy
i
pressed
her
to
my
heart
very
well
let
us
go
carry
me
where
you
will
support
me
a
little
tullio
i
feel
as
if
my
knees
would
give
way
to
the
house
juliana
where
you
wish
i
supported
her
by
placing
my
arm
around
her
waist
and
i
drew
her
along
she
walked
like
a
somnambulist
at
first
we
were
silent
and
each
moment
we
both
turned
together
toward
one
another
to
look
at
each
other
she
seemed
to
me
to
be
really
a
my
attention
was
arrested
by
the
details
was
preoccupied
by
them
a
slight
mark
scarcely
visible
on
the
skin
a
little
dimple
on
the
lower
lip
the
curvature
of
the
lashes
a
vein
at
the
temple
the
shadow
that
encircled
the
eyes
the
infinitely
delicate
lobe
of
the
ear
the
brown
mark
on
the
neck
was
hardly
hidden
by
the
edging
of
lace
at
each
movement
of
the
head
that
juliana
made
one
saw
it
appear
or
disappear
and
that
little
particularity
irritated
my
impatience
i
was
intoxicated
and
yet
i
was
very
lucid
i
heard
the
cries
of
the
swallows
more
numerous
the
splashing
of
the
jets
of
water
in
the
fountain
close
by
i
had
the
sensation
that
life
was
fleeting
that
time
was
flying
and
that
sun
and
those
flowers
and
those
perfumes
and
those
sounds
and
all
the
joyousness
of
the
springtime
aroused
in
me
for
the
third
time
an
inexplicable
emotion
of
anxiety
my
willow
cried
juliana
as
we
arrived
at
the
fountain
and
she
ceased
leaning
on
me
walked
more
rapidly
look
look
how
tall
it
is
do
you
remember
it
was
only
a
branch
after
being
pensive
for
a
moment
she
added
in
a
different
tone
and
in
a
low
voice
i
saw
it
do
not
perhaps
know
i
came
here
to
the
lilacs
other
she
could
not
restrain
a
sigh
but
immediately
as
if
to
dissipate
the
shadow
that
these
words
had
put
between
us
as
if
to
remove
the
bitterness
from
her
mouth
she
bent
toward
one
of
the
two
faucets
drank
a
few
mouthfuls
then
turning
towards
me
made
a
gesture
as
if
asking
a
kiss
her
chin
was
still
wet
and
her
lips
cool
we
both
felt
that
what
was
to
be
must
be
and
we
longed
for
the
supreme
reconciliation
that
every
fibre
of
our
beings
demanded
when
we
disengaged
ourselves
our
eyes
repeated
the
same
intoxicating
promise
and
how
extraordinary
was
the
sentiment
expressed
by
juliana
s
physiognomy
but
then
i
did
not
understand
it
later
on
only
during
the
hours
that
followed
did
it
become
later
i
knew
that
a
vision
of
death
and
a
vision
of
voluptuousness
had
at
the
same
time
intoxicated
the
poor
creature
and
that
in
abandoning
herself
to
the
languors
of
her
flesh
she
had
made
a
funeral
vow
i
see
as
if
i
had
her
before
my
eyes
i
shall
always
see
that
face
full
of
mystery
under
the
shadow
of
that
willow
which
rained
on
us
its
great
vegetal
chevelure
beneath
the
sun
between
the
long
branches
of
diaphanous
foliage
silvery
reflections
from
the
water
imparted
a
hallucinating
vibration
to
the
shade
the
echoes
combined
in
a
low
and
continuous
monotone
the
sonorous
sound
of
the
jets
of
water
all
these
appearances
exalted
my
mind
out
of
the
world
about
me
we
went
toward
the
house
without
speaking
my
joy
was
so
great
at
our
reconciliation
our
reawakened
love
that
my
soul
was
transported
in
a
whirlwind
of
joy
so
high
the
pulsations
of
my
arteries
were
so
violent
that
i
thought
is
this
delirium
i
felt
nothing
of
this
on
my
first
marriage
night
when
i
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
nuptial
chamber
twice
or
three
times
i
was
seized
by
a
savage
transport
as
if
by
a
sudden
attack
of
madness
and
it
is
wonderful
that
i
could
contain
myself
so
great
was
my
physical
desire
to
take
possession
again
of
this
woman
in
her
also
the
crisis
must
have
become
insupportable
because
she
stopped
and
sighed
oh
my
god
my
god
this
is
too
much
suffocating
oppressed
she
took
my
hand
and
placed
it
over
her
heart
feel
said
she
i
felt
less
the
throbbing
of
her
heart
than
the
elasticity
of
her
breast
through
the
cloth
i
saw
the
iris
in
juliana
s
eyes
become
hidden
under
the
closing
eyelids
for
fear
that
she
would
faint
i
supported
her
then
i
bore
her
away
i
carried
her
almost
as
far
as
the
cypress
as
far
as
a
bench
where
we
both
sat
down
both
exhausted
the
house
rose
before
us
as
if
in
a
dream
leaning
her
head
on
my
shoulder
she
said
ah
tullio
how
terrible
do
you
not
think
too
that
we
could
die
from
it
she
added
gravely
in
a
voice
that
seemed
to
come
from
i
know
not
what
depths
of
her
soul
shall
we
both
die
i
felt
a
strange
shudder
which
convinced
me
that
these
words
expressed
an
extraordinary
state
of
mind
perhaps
the
same
sentiment
that
had
transformed
her
face
beneath
the
willow
after
the
embrace
after
the
silent
resolution
but
this
time
again
i
could
not
understand
i
understood
only
that
we
were
both
possessed
by
a
species
of
delirium
and
that
we
were
both
breathing
the
atmosphere
of
a
dream
the
house
rose
before
us
as
in
a
vision
on
the
rustic
façade
on
every
cornice
on
every
projection
along
the
gutters
on
the
architraves
beneath
the
window
ledges
beneath
the
stones
of
the
balconies
between
the
brackets
between
the
eminences
everywhere
the
swallows
had
built
their
nests
the
clay
nests
by
thousands
old
and
new
cemented
together
like
the
cells
of
a
hive
had
but
few
spaces
between
them
in
these
spaces
and
on
the
slats
of
the
venetian
shutters
and
on
the
of
the
balustrades
the
excrements
made
white
patches
like
thinned
chalk
closed
and
without
inhabitants
this
house
nevertheless
was
full
of
bustling
life
joyous
and
tender
the
faithful
swallows
whirled
around
in
their
flight
with
their
cries
their
scintillations
with
all
their
tendernesses
ceaselessly
while
in
the
air
flocks
pursued
one
another
strong
swift
strokes
as
rapid
as
arrows
with
great
alternating
clamors
flying
away
coming
closer
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
brushing
close
to
the
trees
then
rising
up
again
in
reflecting
flashes
in
the
sunlight
indefatigable
in
and
about
the
nests
there
was
an
activity
of
another
sort
but
not
the
less
ardent
some
of
the
swallows
remained
for
several
moments
fixed
before
the
orifices
others
sustained
themselves
on
their
wings
while
in
flight
others
in
showed
on
the
outside
only
their
little
forked
tails
quivering
and
agile
black
and
white
on
the
grayish
mud
others
out
showed
a
small
portion
of
their
shining
breasts
and
throats
others
up
to
then
invisible
flew
out
with
a
piercing
cry
and
flew
off
all
this
lively
and
joyous
movement
around
the
closed
house
all
that
animation
around
the
nests
of
our
nest
of
the
old
days
formed
a
spectacle
so
delightful
a
miracle
of
gentleness
so
exquisite
that
for
several
minutes
as
if
during
a
respite
from
our
fever
we
forgot
ourselves
in
its
contemplation
i
broke
the
enchantment
by
rising
here
is
the
key
i
said
what
are
we
waiting
for
ah
tullio
let
us
wait
a
little
longer
she
begged
in
a
sort
of
fright
i
am
going
to
open
the
door
and
i
approached
the
door
i
mounted
the
three
steps
which
produced
on
me
the
effect
that
they
were
those
of
an
altar
at
the
moment
when
i
was
about
to
turn
the
key
with
the
trembling
of
a
devotee
who
is
opening
a
reliquary
i
felt
juliana
behind
me
she
had
followed
me
furtively
lightly
as
a
shadow
i
started
is
it
you
yes
it
is
i
she
murmured
caressingly
the
exhalation
of
her
breath
warm
on
my
ear
she
put
her
arms
around
my
neck
so
that
her
delicate
wrists
crossed
beneath
my
chin
that
furtive
act
the
laugh
that
rippled
in
her
voice
and
betrayed
her
infantile
joy
at
having
startled
me
that
manner
of
embracing
me
all
those
agile
graces
recalled
to
me
the
juliana
of
the
old
days
the
young
and
tender
companion
of
the
happy
years
the
delicious
creature
with
the
long
tresses
merry
laughter
and
girlish
ways
an
effluvium
of
the
happiness
enveloped
me
on
the
threshold
of
this
house
filled
with
memories
shall
i
open
i
asked
my
hand
rested
on
the
key
ready
to
turn
it
open
she
answered
she
did
not
loosen
her
hold
on
me
and
i
continued
to
feel
her
breath
on
my
neck
at
the
creaking
made
by
the
key
in
the
lock
her
arms
clasped
me
more
firmly
and
she
pressed
against
me
communicating
to
me
her
tremor
the
swallows
warbled
over
our
heads
and
their
light
twitterings
contrasted
so
to
speak
with
the
depth
of
the
silence
go
in
she
murmured
without
loosing
her
hold
on
me
go
in
go
in
that
voice
coming
from
lips
so
near
yet
invisible
real
and
yet
mysterious
breathed
all
warm
in
my
ear
and
yet
so
intimate
that
it
seemed
to
speak
to
the
centre
of
my
soul
more
feminine
softer
than
ever
voice
was
before
i
hear
it
still
i
shall
hear
it
forever
go
in
go
in
i
pushed
the
door
open
we
crossed
the
threshold
together
as
if
dissolved
into
one
single
person
noiselessly
the
vestibule
was
lighted
by
a
high
round
window
a
swallow
flew
over
our
heads
warbling
we
raised
our
eyes
in
surprise
a
nest
hung
among
the
grotesques
of
the
ceiling
there
was
a
broken
in
the
window
the
swallow
flew
out
through
the
opening
still
warbling
now
i
am
entirely
yours
entirely
murmured
juliana
without
detaching
her
hold
on
my
neck
but
by
a
sinuous
movement
she
fell
on
my
breast
and
met
my
mouth
we
exchanged
a
long
kiss
i
said
to
her
with
intoxication
come
let
us
go
up
shall
i
carry
you
in
spite
of
the
intoxication
i
felt
a
sufficient
strength
in
my
muscles
to
carry
her
at
one
bound
to
the
top
of
the
stairway
she
answered
no
i
can
go
up
alone
but
to
see
her
to
hear
her
she
seemed
incapable
of
it
i
put
my
arms
round
her
as
i
had
already
done
in
the
garden
i
raised
her
i
urged
her
up
step
by
step
one
would
have
said
that
in
the
house
there
was
a
deep
and
distant
buzzing
like
that
heard
in
the
folds
of
certain
one
would
have
said
that
no
other
sound
penetrated
there
from
the
exterior
when
we
were
upon
the
landing
instead
of
opening
the
door
facing
us
i
turned
to
the
right
in
the
dark
corridor
and
i
drew
her
on
with
my
hand
without
speaking
she
was
panting
so
that
it
pained
me
her
agitation
was
communicated
to
me
where
are
we
going
she
asked
to
room
i
answered
one
could
scarcely
see
i
was
guided
as
if
by
instinct
i
found
the
knob
i
opened
we
entered
the
obscurity
was
partly
illuminated
by
rays
of
light
that
filtered
through
the
cracks
of
the
shutters
and
here
a
deeper
buzzing
was
heard
i
should
have
liked
to
run
to
the
windows
to
immediately
admit
more
light
but
i
could
not
leave
juliana
it
seemed
to
me
impossible
to
detach
myself
from
her
to
interrupt
were
it
but
for
a
second
the
contact
of
our
hands
as
if
through
the
skin
the
live
ends
of
our
nerves
were
magnetically
adhered
we
advanced
together
groping
our
way
through
the
dark
it
was
two
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
about
three
hours
had
passed
since
our
arrival
at
the
lilacs
i
had
left
juliana
alone
for
a
few
minutes
i
had
gone
to
call
calisto
the
old
man
had
brought
the
lunch
basket
and
on
receiving
for
the
second
time
a
rather
abrupt
dismissal
he
had
shown
instead
of
surprise
a
certain
malicious
juliana
and
i
now
were
seated
at
the
table
like
two
lovers
opposite
each
other
exchanging
smiles
before
us
were
spread
cold
meats
preserved
fruits
biscuits
oranges
and
a
bottle
of
chablis
the
room
with
its
ceiling
decorated
in
rococo
with
its
walls
its
pastoral
scenes
painted
over
the
doors
had
a
sort
of
gayety
now
out
of
fashion
the
air
of
a
past
century
through
the
open
balcony
a
very
soft
light
entered
because
long
milky
streaks
were
spread
over
the
heavens
in
the
rectangle
of
the
pale
sky
stood
out
the
old
venerable
cypress
whose
trunk
arose
from
the
midst
of
a
and
whose
top
sheltered
a
nest
of
nightingales
lower
down
through
the
bent
of
the
balustrade
could
be
seen
the
exquisite
forest
of
light
violet
tone
the
vernal
glory
of
the
lilacs
the
triple
perfume
the
vernal
soul
of
the
lilacs
was
disseminated
in
the
calm
and
slow
harmonious
undulations
do
you
remember
said
juliana
she
repeated
do
you
remember
to
her
lips
rose
one
by
one
the
most
distant
reminiscences
of
our
love
that
barely
evoked
by
a
discreet
allusion
were
nevertheless
revived
with
an
extraordinary
intensity
in
that
place
that
had
seen
their
birth
among
propitious
objects
but
the
sad
disquietude
and
the
frenzy
of
life
that
had
taken
possession
of
me
in
the
garden
on
our
first
entry
were
irritated
now
to
impatience
and
suggested
to
me
hyperbolical
visions
of
the
future
that
i
opposed
to
the
phantoms
of
an
importunate
past
in
two
or
three
days
at
the
latest
we
must
come
back
here
to
stay
but
alone
you
see
there
is
nothing
lacking
everything
is
in
its
place
if
you
wish
we
could
even
remain
here
you
do
not
wish
to
really
you
do
not
wish
to
by
my
voice
gesture
look
i
sought
to
tempt
her
my
knees
touched
her
knees
but
she
looked
at
me
fixedly
without
answering
remember
the
here
at
the
lilacs
we
strolled
here
after
the
and
saw
the
lights
at
the
windows
ah
you
understand
me
well
the
lights
that
illuminate
a
house
for
the
first
time
first
do
you
remember
up
to
now
you
have
done
nothing
but
remember
remember
and
yet
you
see
all
your
recollections
are
not
worth
to
me
one
minute
of
will
not
be
worth
one
minute
of
could
you
possibly
doubt
the
happiness
that
awaits
you
i
have
never
loved
you
juliana
as
much
as
i
love
you
at
this
moment
never
never
do
you
hear
never
have
i
been
as
much
yours
as
now
juliana
i
will
recount
to
you
i
will
describe
to
you
my
days
in
order
that
you
may
understand
your
miracles
after
so
much
unhappiness
who
could
have
hoped
for
anything
like
this
i
will
tell
you
at
certain
times
it
seemed
to
me
i
had
gone
back
to
the
period
of
my
adolescence
to
the
time
of
my
youth
i
felt
myself
as
i
did
then
good
tender
simple
i
remembered
nothing
more
all
all
my
thoughts
were
of
you
all
my
emotions
were
centred
in
you
sometimes
the
sight
of
a
flower
of
a
little
leaf
sufficed
to
make
my
soul
overflow
so
full
it
was
and
you
knew
nothing
you
perceived
nothing
perhaps
i
will
tell
you
the
other
day
saturday
when
i
entered
your
room
with
the
white
hawthorns
i
was
as
timid
as
an
amorous
boy
and
internally
i
felt
as
if
i
were
dying
with
desire
to
take
you
in
my
arms
did
you
perceive
it
i
will
tell
you
everything
i
will
make
you
laugh
that
day
the
curtains
of
the
alcove
permitted
a
view
of
your
bed
i
could
not
remove
my
eyes
from
it
i
was
all
trembling
how
i
trembled
you
can
not
understand
two
or
three
times
already
i
have
entered
your
room
alone
by
stealth
my
heart
palpitating
and
i
have
raised
the
curtains
to
look
at
your
bed
to
touch
your
cover
to
bury
my
face
in
your
pillow
like
a
fanatical
lover
and
certain
nights
when
all
was
asleep
at
the
badiola
i
have
ventured
softly
softly
almost
as
far
as
your
door
i
thought
i
heard
your
breathing
tell
me
tell
me
may
i
come
to
you
do
you
want
me
tell
me
will
you
expect
me
can
we
sleep
separated
from
each
other
no
it
is
not
possible
your
cheek
will
find
on
my
bosom
its
accustomed
place
here
do
you
remember
how
light
you
seemed
when
you
were
sleeping
be
quiet
be
quiet
tullio
she
interrupted
supplicatingly
as
if
my
words
pained
her
she
added
with
a
smile
you
must
not
talk
like
that
i
told
you
so
just
now
i
am
so
weak
i
am
only
a
poor
invalid
you
make
me
feel
dizzy
i
can
no
longer
stand
upright
see
to
what
a
state
you
have
reduced
me
i
am
half
dead
she
smiled
a
weak
tired
smile
her
eyelids
were
slightly
reddened
but
in
spite
of
the
heaviness
of
the
lids
the
pupils
burned
with
a
febrile
ardor
and
constantly
regarded
me
with
an
almost
intolerable
fixity
scarcely
softened
by
the
shadow
of
the
eyelashes
in
her
entire
manner
there
was
some
constraint
that
my
eyes
could
not
discern
nor
my
intelligence
define
had
her
face
ever
borne
such
a
mysterious
and
disquieting
character
before
it
seemed
as
if
its
expression
became
from
moment
to
moment
more
complicated
vague
almost
enigmatical
and
i
thought
she
is
harassed
by
an
internal
tempest
she
can
no
longer
clearly
distinguish
what
has
taken
place
in
her
state
in
her
without
doubt
everything
is
upset
has
not
one
moment
sufficed
to
change
her
existence
and
that
profound
expression
attracted
me
excited
me
ever
more
and
more
the
ardor
of
her
look
penetrated
even
to
my
marrow
with
a
devouring
fire
i
was
glad
to
see
her
so
crushed
i
was
impatient
to
know
her
mine
to
embrace
her
again
to
hear
her
utter
a
new
cry
to
drink
in
her
entire
soul
you
are
not
eating
i
said
making
an
effort
to
dissipate
the
vapors
that
rapidly
mounted
to
my
brain
nor
are
you
take
a
bite
at
least
do
you
not
recognize
this
wine
oh
yes
i
recognize
it
do
you
remember
and
we
looked
into
the
depths
of
each
other
s
eyes
agitated
by
the
evocation
of
the
memory
of
our
love
over
which
floated
the
delicate
vapor
of
that
pale
and
somewhat
bitter
wine
her
favorite
beverage
let
us
drink
together
to
our
happiness
we
clinked
our
glasses
and
i
drank
mine
at
a
single
draught
but
she
did
not
even
moisten
her
lip
arrested
by
an
insurmountable
repugnance
well
i
can
not
tullio
why
i
can
not
do
not
compel
me
to
one
single
drop
would
i
believe
suffice
to
make
me
she
had
become
as
pale
as
death
juliana
you
are
ill
a
little
let
us
rise
let
us
go
out
on
the
balcony
putting
my
arm
round
her
i
felt
the
softness
of
her
waist
for
in
my
absence
she
had
removed
her
corset
i
said
to
her
would
you
like
to
lie
down
you
can
rest
and
i
will
remain
near
you
no
tullio
you
see
i
already
feel
better
we
stopped
on
the
sill
of
the
balcony
with
the
cypress
before
us
she
leaned
against
the
and
placed
one
hand
on
my
shoulder
from
the
projection
of
the
architrave
below
the
cornice
hung
a
group
of
nests
the
swallows
were
coming
and
going
with
incessant
activity
but
below
the
calm
of
the
garden
was
so
profound
the
top
of
the
cypress
was
so
motionless
that
the
sounds
of
the
wings
these
flights
these
cries
displeased
me
tired
me
since
in
this
tranquil
light
everything
hid
itself
i
sought
repose
a
long
period
of
silence
in
order
to
taste
in
plenitude
the
suavity
of
the
hour
and
the
isolation
are
the
nightingales
always
there
i
asked
pointing
to
the
top
of
the
venerable
tree
who
knows
perhaps
they
sing
at
night
would
you
not
like
to
hear
them
again
but
at
what
time
will
federico
come
back
let
us
hope
late
oh
yes
late
very
late
she
cried
with
such
warm
sincerity
of
hope
that
it
caused
me
a
thrill
of
joy
are
you
happy
i
asked
her
and
i
sought
the
answer
in
her
eyes
yes
i
am
happy
she
answered
lowering
her
eyelids
you
know
that
i
love
only
you
that
i
am
yours
forever
i
know
it
and
do
you
love
me
you
will
never
know
how
much
my
poor
tullio
as
she
uttered
these
words
she
left
the
and
leaned
her
entire
weight
on
me
with
one
of
those
indescribable
motions
in
which
she
threw
all
the
sweetness
and
abandon
that
the
most
feminine
of
creatures
could
show
to
a
man
how
beautiful
you
are
how
beautiful
you
are
beautiful
in
fact
beautiful
from
languor
beautiful
in
soft
suppleness
and
how
shall
i
say
so
fluid
that
she
made
me
think
of
the
possibility
of
drinking
her
down
in
small
portions
to
quench
my
thirst
of
her
on
the
pallor
of
her
face
the
mass
of
loosened
hair
seemed
on
the
point
of
spreading
out
like
a
wave
the
eyelashes
threw
a
shadow
on
her
cheeks
agitating
me
more
than
a
look
would
have
done
nor
will
you
ever
know
how
much
if
i
told
you
the
mad
thoughts
that
are
born
in
me
my
happiness
is
so
great
that
it
becomes
anguish
it
makes
me
wish
to
die
die
she
repeated
very
low
with
a
feeble
smile
who
knows
tullio
if
you
will
not
see
me
die
before
long
oh
juliana
she
turned
round
to
look
at
me
and
added
tell
me
what
would
you
do
if
i
were
to
die
suddenly
child
if
for
instance
i
were
dead
won
t
you
be
silent
i
took
her
head
and
kissed
her
on
the
mouth
cheeks
eyes
forehead
hair
with
light
and
rapid
kisses
she
did
not
attempt
to
stop
me
and
even
when
i
ceased
she
murmured
more
let
us
return
to
our
room
i
begged
her
drawing
her
away
she
permitted
herself
to
be
led
in
our
room
the
balcony
was
permitted
to
remain
open
and
there
entered
through
it
with
the
light
the
odor
of
the
that
flourished
in
the
vicinity
against
the
tapestries
the
little
blue
flowers
seemed
so
faded
that
they
were
scarcely
distinguishable
a
corner
of
the
garden
was
reflected
in
the
mirror
of
a
closet
receding
in
it
like
a
chimerical
landscape
juliana
s
gloves
hat
and
bracelet
lying
on
the
table
seemed
to
have
reawakened
in
this
interior
the
happy
life
of
long
ago
to
have
shed
a
renewed
intimacy
we
must
return
here
not
later
i
said
burning
with
impatience
feeling
an
ardor
and
seduction
from
every
one
of
these
objects
we
must
sleep
here
you
wish
it
too
do
you
not
to
begin
to
love
again
in
this
house
in
that
garden
in
this
springtime
to
begin
to
love
once
more
as
if
oblivion
had
effaced
everything
to
seek
once
more
one
by
one
our
caresses
and
find
in
each
one
a
new
savor
as
if
we
had
never
before
tasted
it
to
have
before
us
days
long
days
no
no
tullio
we
must
not
speak
of
the
future
you
know
that
it
is
an
evil
omen
of
of
the
present
hour
i
believe
i
heard
the
horses
bells
said
juliana
rising
it
s
federico
we
listened
she
must
have
been
mistaken
is
it
not
time
she
asked
yes
it
is
almost
six
o
clock
oh
dio
we
listened
again
but
no
sound
announced
the
approach
of
the
carriage
it
would
be
better
to
go
and
see
tullio
i
left
the
room
and
descended
the
stairs
i
hesitated
a
little
a
cloud
was
before
my
eyes
it
seemed
to
me
that
a
mist
rose
from
my
brain
from
the
little
side
door
that
opened
in
the
surrounding
wall
i
called
calisto
whose
dwelling
was
near
by
i
interrogated
him
the
carriage
had
not
been
seen
yet
the
old
man
would
have
liked
to
detain
me
in
conversation
do
you
know
calisto
i
said
to
him
that
probably
we
will
return
here
to
stay
he
raised
his
arms
in
token
of
his
delight
really
really
we
shall
have
time
to
chat
when
you
see
the
carriage
come
and
let
me
know
calisto
i
left
him
to
reënter
the
house
the
day
was
waning
and
the
swallows
cried
still
more
loudly
the
sky
seemed
to
be
alive
with
them
as
the
flocks
rapidly
cleft
the
air
well
asked
juliana
turning
from
the
mirror
which
she
had
approached
in
order
to
adjust
her
hat
nothing
look
at
me
is
not
my
hair
dishevelled
no
but
what
a
face
just
look
one
would
have
thought
that
she
had
stepped
from
a
coffin
she
seemed
so
exhausted
great
violet
rings
encircled
her
eyes
and
yet
i
still
live
she
added
attempting
to
smile
are
you
suffering
no
tullio
but
i
do
not
know
what
ails
me
it
seems
to
me
that
i
am
entirely
empty
that
my
head
is
empty
my
veins
empty
my
heart
empty
you
might
say
i
had
given
you
all
you
am
now
a
shadow
a
shadow
of
life
while
pronouncing
these
words
she
smiled
in
a
strange
manner
she
smiled
a
subtle
and
sibylline
smile
that
troubled
me
that
raised
up
in
me
confused
inquietudes
i
was
too
enervated
i
was
too
languid
too
much
blinded
by
my
intoxication
the
activity
of
my
mind
had
become
indolent
my
consciousness
became
dulled
no
sinister
suspicion
had
penetrated
me
yet
meanwhile
i
looked
at
her
attentively
i
examined
her
with
anxiety
without
knowing
why
she
turned
to
the
mirror
again
and
put
on
her
hat
then
she
approached
the
table
and
took
her
bracelet
and
gloves
i
am
ready
she
said
she
seemed
to
be
still
seeking
something
and
added
i
had
a
parasol
had
i
not
yes
i
think
so
ah
i
must
have
left
it
in
the
alley
on
the
bench
let
us
go
and
look
for
it
together
i
am
too
tired
then
i
will
go
alone
no
send
calisto
i
will
go
myself
i
will
gather
you
a
few
lilacs
a
bouquet
of
shall
i
no
don
t
pluck
the
flowers
come
sit
down
here
while
waiting
perhaps
federico
will
be
late
i
drew
up
an
for
her
from
the
balcony
and
she
sank
into
it
as
you
are
going
down
she
said
see
if
my
cloak
is
at
calisto
s
i
did
not
leave
it
in
the
carriage
did
i
i
feel
a
little
cold
in
fact
she
was
shivering
shall
i
close
the
balcony
no
no
let
me
look
at
the
garden
how
beautiful
it
is
now
do
you
see
how
beautiful
it
is
the
garden
here
and
there
had
vague
golden
tones
the
blooming
cimes
of
the
took
on
an
ardent
violet
tone
in
the
fading
light
and
as
below
the
rest
of
the
flowering
branches
formed
a
mass
that
undulated
in
the
wind
one
could
have
imagined
it
the
reflections
of
a
changeable
moiré
at
the
fountain
the
weeping
willows
bent
their
graceful
tresses
the
water
seen
between
the
trees
had
the
soft
brilliancy
of
this
motionless
brilliancy
these
weeping
trees
that
delightful
forest
of
flowers
in
that
fading
gold
composed
an
illusory
enchanting
unreal
picture
for
several
minutes
we
both
remained
silent
beneath
the
empire
of
this
magic
a
confused
melancholy
enveloped
my
soul
the
sombre
despair
that
lies
at
the
root
of
all
human
love
arose
within
me
before
this
ideal
spectacle
my
physical
fatigue
the
torpor
of
my
senses
seemed
to
become
heavier
i
had
become
the
prey
of
an
uneasiness
a
discontent
an
indefinable
remorse
like
one
experiences
after
an
indulgence
that
has
been
too
acute
or
too
prolonged
i
suffered
juliana
said
to
me
as
if
in
a
dream
yes
now
i
would
like
to
close
my
eyes
never
to
reopen
them
again
she
added
with
a
thrill
i
m
cold
tullio
go
quickly
stretched
out
in
the
she
huddled
up
as
if
to
resist
the
fits
of
shivering
that
assailed
her
her
face
particularly
around
the
nose
was
as
transparent
as
certain
white
albatrosses
she
was
in
pain
you
don
t
feel
well
poor
soul
i
said
to
her
stirred
by
pity
and
also
by
a
slight
fear
as
i
looked
at
her
fixedly
i
m
cold
go
tullio
bring
me
my
cloak
quick
please
i
ran
down
to
calisto
s
lodge
got
the
cloak
and
went
up
again
immediately
she
hastened
to
put
it
on
i
assisted
her
when
she
was
seated
in
the
again
she
said
to
me
burying
her
hands
in
her
sleeves
that
is
better
now
i
ll
go
and
fetch
the
parasol
which
you
left
over
there
no
it
doesn
t
matter
i
had
a
strange
and
mad
desire
to
go
back
to
the
old
stone
bench
where
we
had
made
our
first
halt
where
she
had
cried
where
she
had
spoken
the
three
divine
words
yes
still
more
was
it
a
sentimental
attraction
was
it
the
curiosity
of
a
new
sensation
was
it
the
fascination
exercised
over
me
by
the
mysterious
aspect
of
the
garden
in
the
deepening
twilight
i
ll
go
and
come
back
in
a
minute
i
said
i
went
out
when
i
was
under
the
balcony
i
cried
juliana
she
showed
herself
i
shall
always
retain
in
the
eyes
of
my
soul
that
silent
ghostly
apparition
yet
distinct
as
a
living
thing
her
tall
figure
rendered
still
taller
by
the
length
of
the
amaranthine
cloak
and
against
this
dark
silhouette
that
pale
face
so
pale
the
words
of
jacques
to
amanda
are
indissolubly
associated
in
my
mind
with
that
unchangeable
vision
pale
you
are
amanda
have
you
opened
your
veins
to
tint
your
robe
she
withdrew
or
rather
to
describe
the
sensation
i
felt
she
evaporated
i
advanced
rapidly
along
the
path
without
full
consciousness
of
what
impelled
me
i
heard
the
sound
of
my
own
resound
in
my
brain
i
was
so
preoccupied
that
i
was
obliged
to
stop
to
find
out
where
i
was
what
caused
this
blind
agitation
in
me
a
simple
physical
cause
particular
condition
of
my
nerves
that
is
what
i
believed
incapable
of
an
effort
of
thought
of
a
methodical
examination
of
meditation
i
submitted
to
the
tyranny
of
my
nerves
by
which
the
external
appearances
were
reflected
provoking
phenomena
of
extraordinary
intensity
as
in
hallucinations
but
like
certain
thoughts
lit
up
all
the
rest
and
increased
the
oppressive
feeling
that
several
unexpected
incidents
had
already
given
rise
to
in
me
no
juliana
had
not
appeared
to
me
as
i
had
imagined
she
would
as
she
should
have
done
had
she
still
been
the
same
creature
i
knew
before
the
juliana
of
the
old
days
she
had
not
assumed
toward
me
the
attitudes
that
i
had
expected
in
certain
circumstances
a
strange
element
something
obscure
violent
and
excessive
had
modified
and
deformed
her
personality
must
this
change
be
attributed
to
the
sickly
condition
of
her
organism
i
am
ill
i
am
very
ill
she
had
often
repeated
as
if
in
justification
truly
illness
produces
profound
changes
and
may
render
a
human
being
unrecognizable
but
what
was
her
malady
was
it
the
old
one
not
extirpated
by
the
surgeon
s
steel
complicated
perhaps
perhaps
incurable
who
knows
if
you
will
not
see
me
die
before
long
she
had
said
in
a
singular
tone
that
may
have
been
prophetic
she
had
spoken
of
death
several
times
she
therefore
knew
that
she
carried
within
her
a
fatal
germ
was
she
dominated
by
this
lugubrious
thought
it
was
perhaps
such
a
thought
that
had
fired
in
her
those
sombre
almost
hopeless
almost
demented
ardors
when
she
was
in
my
arms
it
was
perhaps
the
great
sudden
light
of
happiness
that
had
rendered
more
visible
and
more
frightful
the
spectre
that
pursued
her
could
it
be
possible
that
she
might
die
could
death
strike
her
even
while
in
my
arms
in
the
midst
of
happiness
i
thought
with
a
fright
that
froze
me
that
for
several
moments
rooted
me
to
the
spot
as
if
the
peril
were
immediate
as
if
juliana
had
predicted
truly
when
she
had
said
if
for
instance
i
were
to
die
the
twilight
fell
slightly
damp
breaths
of
humid
air
ran
over
the
bushes
causing
a
rustling
like
that
which
the
rapid
passage
of
animals
through
them
would
have
produced
a
few
scattered
swallows
cleft
the
air
with
cries
like
the
flight
of
a
stone
propelled
by
a
sling
at
sunset
the
horizon
still
luminous
had
the
immense
reverberations
of
a
sinister
forge
i
arrived
at
the
bench
and
found
the
parasol
i
did
not
linger
there
in
spite
of
the
recent
memories
still
keen
still
warm
that
disturbed
my
soul
it
was
there
she
had
fallen
fainting
vanquished
it
was
there
i
had
spoken
to
her
the
supreme
words
that
i
had
made
to
her
the
intoxicating
avowal
were
in
my
house
while
i
sought
you
afar
there
that
i
had
gathered
from
her
lips
the
breath
that
had
ravished
my
soul
to
the
supreme
heights
of
joy
there
that
i
had
drunk
her
first
tears
that
i
had
heard
her
sobs
that
i
had
uttered
the
obscure
question
is
too
late
perhaps
is
it
too
late
only
a
few
hours
had
passed
and
all
that
was
already
so
far
only
a
few
hours
had
passed
and
already
the
happiness
had
faded
away
now
with
a
new
but
none
the
less
dreadful
signification
the
question
was
repeated
within
me
it
is
too
late
perhaps
is
it
too
late
and
my
exaltation
grew
and
that
uncertain
light
and
that
silent
nightfall
and
those
suspicious
rustlings
in
the
already
shadowy
bushes
and
all
those
deceptive
phantasmagorias
of
the
twilight
had
for
my
mind
a
fatal
meaning
if
really
it
were
too
late
if
really
she
knew
herself
to
be
doomed
if
she
already
knew
that
she
carried
death
in
her
bosom
tired
of
living
tired
of
suffering
hoping
nothing
more
from
me
not
daring
to
kill
herself
at
once
with
a
or
with
poison
she
had
perhaps
cultivated
has
perhaps
nourished
her
malady
has
kept
it
secret
in
order
to
facilitate
its
progress
to
permit
it
to
take
root
to
render
it
incurable
she
has
wished
to
arrive
slowly
and
in
secret
at
her
final
liberation
while
observing
herself
she
has
become
familiar
with
the
science
of
her
malady
and
now
knows
she
is
that
she
will
succumb
she
knows
too
that
love
that
voluptuousness
that
my
kisses
will
precipitate
the
catastrophe
i
return
to
her
for
good
an
unhoped
for
happiness
opens
out
before
her
she
loves
me
she
knows
that
i
love
her
greatly
in
one
day
the
dream
has
become
for
us
a
reality
and
it
is
then
that
there
rises
to
her
lips
the
word
death
confusedly
i
saw
pass
before
me
the
cruel
images
that
had
tormented
me
during
those
two
hours
of
waiting
on
the
morning
of
the
surgical
operation
when
i
seemed
to
have
before
my
eyes
as
clearly
as
the
figures
on
an
anatomical
atlas
all
the
frightful
ravages
produced
by
maladies
in
the
organisms
of
women
and
there
recurred
to
me
another
recollection
still
more
distant
with
an
accompaniment
of
precise
images
the
darkened
room
the
open
window
the
waving
curtains
the
flickering
before
the
dim
mirror
the
sinister
appearance
of
things
and
she
juliana
upright
leaning
against
a
closet
convulsed
writhing
as
if
she
had
swallowed
poison
and
the
accusing
voice
the
same
voice
also
repeated
to
me
is
for
you
for
you
that
she
wanted
to
die
it
is
you
you
who
have
urged
her
on
to
seized
by
a
blind
fright
by
a
sort
of
panic
as
if
all
these
images
had
been
veritable
realities
i
ran
back
to
the
house
on
raising
my
eyes
the
house
seemed
without
signs
of
life
the
window
openings
and
the
balconies
were
filled
with
shadows
juliana
i
cried
with
supreme
anguish
springing
to
the
stairway
as
if
i
feared
i
should
not
arrive
soon
enough
to
see
her
again
what
ailed
me
what
was
this
dementia
i
panted
as
i
climbed
the
stairs
in
the
i
rushed
into
the
room
what
is
the
matter
asked
juliana
rising
nothing
nothing
i
thought
you
had
called
me
i
have
run
a
little
how
are
you
feeling
now
i
am
so
cold
tullio
so
cold
feel
my
hands
she
stretched
her
hands
out
to
me
they
were
icy
i
am
frozen
all
over
like
that
my
god
where
did
you
get
this
terrible
chill
what
can
i
do
to
warm
you
up
do
not
worry
tullio
this
is
not
the
first
time
it
lasts
hours
and
hours
i
can
do
nothing
for
it
i
must
wait
until
it
passes
away
but
why
is
federico
so
long
it
is
almost
dark
she
sank
back
in
the
as
if
she
had
exhausted
all
her
strength
in
pronouncing
these
words
i
will
close
the
window
i
said
turning
toward
the
balcony
no
no
leave
it
open
it
is
not
the
air
that
chills
me
on
the
contrary
i
need
all
the
air
i
can
get
come
here
nearer
to
me
take
this
stool
i
knelt
down
with
a
feeble
gesture
she
passed
her
cold
hand
over
my
head
and
murmured
my
poor
tullio
i
broke
out
incapable
of
containing
myself
oh
tell
me
juliana
my
love
my
life
in
pity
tell
me
the
truth
you
are
hiding
something
from
me
surely
you
have
something
you
do
not
want
to
confess
there
in
the
centre
of
your
forehead
there
is
a
fixed
idea
some
sombre
preoccupation
that
has
not
left
you
for
an
instant
since
we
have
been
here
since
we
have
but
are
we
truly
happy
are
you
can
you
be
happy
tell
the
truth
juliana
why
would
you
deceive
me
yes
it
is
true
you
have
been
ill
you
are
still
ill
it
is
true
but
no
it
is
not
that
there
is
that
i
do
not
understand
that
i
do
not
know
of
tell
me
the
truth
even
if
the
truth
must
be
to
me
annihilation
this
morning
when
you
sobbed
i
asked
you
it
too
late
and
you
answered
me
no
then
i
believed
your
words
but
might
it
not
be
too
late
for
another
motive
could
not
something
prevent
you
from
enjoying
the
great
happiness
into
which
we
have
just
entered
i
mean
something
you
know
that
you
already
foresee
tell
me
the
truth
i
looked
at
her
fixedly
and
as
she
remained
silent
i
ended
by
seeing
nothing
but
her
large
eyes
extraordinarily
large
deep
and
motionless
all
else
had
disappeared
and
i
was
compelled
to
close
my
eyes
to
dissipate
the
sensation
of
terror
that
these
eyes
caused
in
me
how
long
did
this
last
an
hour
a
second
i
am
ill
she
said
at
last
with
agonized
slowness
ill
but
what
s
the
matter
i
stammered
beside
myself
convinced
that
in
her
tone
i
detected
an
avowal
that
corresponded
with
my
suspicion
what
s
the
matter
dangerously
i
know
not
in
what
voice
i
know
not
in
what
tone
i
know
not
with
what
gesture
i
articulated
the
last
question
i
do
not
even
know
if
it
really
and
entirely
left
my
lips
or
if
she
heard
it
entirely
no
no
tullio
it
is
not
that
i
meant
meant
that
it
is
not
my
fault
if
i
am
a
little
strange
it
is
not
my
fault
you
must
have
patience
with
me
you
must
take
me
now
as
i
am
believe
me
there
is
nothing
more
i
am
concealing
nothing
from
you
i
shall
be
cured
perhaps
later
yes
i
shall
be
cured
you
will
be
patient
will
you
not
you
will
be
good
come
here
tullio
my
soul
you
too
it
seems
to
me
are
a
little
strange
a
little
suspicious
you
have
sudden
fears
you
turn
white
who
knows
what
you
suppose
come
come
here
give
me
a
kiss
another
one
another
one
that
s
right
embrace
me
warm
me
up
again
there
is
federico
she
spoke
in
a
broken
and
rather
low
voice
with
that
inexpressible
caressing
tender
restless
expression
that
she
had
already
done
a
few
hours
before
on
the
bench
to
calm
me
and
console
me
i
embraced
her
in
the
wide
and
low
she
so
thin
made
room
for
me
at
her
side
and
pressed
close
to
me
shivering
and
gathered
up
the
end
of
her
cloak
to
cover
me
with
it
we
were
as
if
on
a
couch
entwined
breast
to
breast
our
breaths
mingling
and
i
thought
if
my
breath
if
my
contact
could
imbue
her
with
all
my
heat
and
i
made
an
illusory
effort
of
will
to
bring
about
this
transfusion
this
evening
i
whispered
this
evening
i
will
hold
you
better
you
won
t
tremble
then
yes
yes
you
ll
see
how
nicely
i
ll
hold
you
i
ll
put
you
to
sleep
all
night
long
you
will
sleep
on
my
heart
yes
yes
i
will
watch
over
you
i
will
quench
my
thirst
with
your
breath
i
will
read
in
your
face
the
dreams
you
are
dreaming
you
will
perhaps
speak
my
name
dreaming
yes
yes
that
on
certain
nights
you
spoke
in
your
dream
how
charming
you
were
ah
what
a
voice
you
can
not
know
a
voice
that
you
could
never
have
heard
that
i
alone
alone
and
i
will
hear
it
again
who
knows
what
you
will
say
you
will
speak
my
name
perhaps
how
i
love
the
movement
of
your
mouth
when
it
pronounces
the
of
my
name
one
could
call
it
the
outline
of
a
kiss
you
know
i
will
prompt
words
into
your
ear
that
they
may
enter
into
your
dream
do
you
remember
that
that
on
certain
mornings
i
divined
your
dreams
ah
you
will
see
dear
soul
i
will
be
more
caressing
than
at
that
time
you
will
see
how
tender
i
will
be
in
order
to
cure
you
you
need
so
much
affection
poor
soul
yes
yes
she
repeated
every
moment
yieldingly
favoring
thereby
my
last
illusion
and
also
augmenting
that
sort
of
drowsy
intoxication
that
arose
from
my
own
voice
and
the
belief
that
my
words
were
cradled
there
like
a
voluptuous
song
did
you
hear
anything
i
asked
suddenly
and
i
raised
myself
a
little
in
order
to
hear
better
what
is
it
federico
no
listen
we
both
listened
our
eyes
turned
toward
the
garden
the
garden
was
but
a
confused
and
mass
touched
here
and
there
by
the
darkening
light
of
the
dying
day
a
zone
of
light
persisted
on
the
limit
of
the
sky
a
long
tricolored
zone
below
of
a
then
orange
then
green
then
a
fading
vegetable
green
in
the
silence
of
the
twilight
a
strong
and
limpid
voice
resounded
like
the
prelude
of
a
flute
the
nightingale
was
singing
it
is
on
the
cypress
murmured
juliana
we
both
listened
our
eyes
turned
toward
the
edge
of
the
horizon
that
paled
beneath
the
impalpable
ashy
color
of
the
evening
my
soul
was
in
suspense
as
if
it
had
expected
from
this
language
some
high
revelation
of
love
what
then
is
this
poor
creature
at
my
side
feeling
to
what
summit
of
despair
is
this
poor
soul
raised
the
nightingale
was
singing
at
first
it
was
like
an
explosion
of
melodious
joyfulness
a
burst
of
smooth
trills
that
rippled
with
the
sound
of
pearls
resounding
on
the
crystals
of
musical
glasses
first
pause
then
arose
a
roll
of
marvellous
agility
extraordinarily
sustained
in
which
was
mingled
the
energy
that
attempts
a
burst
of
courage
a
defiance
thrown
to
an
unknown
rival
second
pause
then
a
theme
on
three
notes
of
an
interrogative
expression
unrolled
the
chain
of
its
light
variations
repeating
five
or
six
times
the
sweet
question
modulated
as
if
on
a
slender
reed
flute
on
a
pastoral
pipe
third
pause
and
the
chant
became
an
elegy
developed
in
a
minor
key
became
softened
like
a
sigh
weakened
to
a
plaint
described
the
sorrow
of
a
solitary
lover
the
vexation
of
desire
the
waiting
in
vain
burst
into
a
final
appeal
unexpected
piercing
like
a
cry
of
anguish
and
died
away
new
pause
more
prolonged
then
there
were
new
tones
that
did
not
seem
to
issue
from
the
same
throat
so
humble
timid
tearful
were
they
so
much
did
they
resemble
the
piping
of
newly
hatched
birds
the
twittering
of
a
little
sparrow
then
with
admirable
flexibility
these
innocent
accents
were
transformed
into
a
whirlwind
of
notes
more
and
more
hurried
that
sparkled
in
trains
of
trills
vibrated
in
dazzling
roulades
softened
into
bold
periods
descended
ascended
mounted
to
prodigious
heights
the
singer
became
intoxicated
by
his
song
with
pauses
so
brief
that
they
scarcely
permitted
the
notes
to
die
away
his
intoxication
overflowed
in
a
melody
that
varied
without
cease
passionate
and
soft
broken
and
vibrant
light
and
grave
interspersed
now
with
feeble
moans
and
plaintive
supplications
now
with
abrupt
lyric
bursts
supreme
adjurations
even
the
garden
seemed
to
be
listening
the
sky
seemed
to
incline
toward
the
venerable
tree
whose
top
sheltered
the
invisible
poet
who
shed
these
torrents
of
poetry
the
forest
of
flowers
respired
deeply
and
silently
at
sunset
several
yellow
streaks
of
light
lingered
on
the
horizon
and
this
last
glance
of
daylight
was
sad
almost
mournful
but
a
star
appeared
palpitating
and
trembling
like
a
drop
of
timorous
dew
i
murmured
almost
unconsciously
and
that
word
to
me
so
full
of
promise
responded
to
an
internal
supplication
to
better
listen
we
had
raised
ourselves
a
little
and
we
had
remained
several
minutes
in
that
position
attentive
suddenly
i
felt
juliana
s
head
fall
on
my
shoulder
heavily
like
a
thing
without
life
juliana
juliana
i
cried
with
fright
by
the
movement
i
made
her
head
fell
back
heavily
like
a
thing
without
life
juliana
she
did
not
hear
when
i
saw
the
cadaverous
pallor
of
that
face
lit
up
by
the
last
yellowish
rays
of
light
from
the
balcony
i
was
struck
by
a
terrible
thought
distracted
allowing
juliana
to
fall
back
on
the
back
of
the
inert
calling
her
ceaselessly
by
name
i
began
to
open
her
corsage
with
contracted
fingers
anxious
to
feel
her
heart
my
brother
s
jovial
voice
called
out
where
are
you
you
lovers
she
had
rapidly
regained
consciousness
although
scarcely
able
to
stand
she
wanted
to
immediately
enter
the
carriage
and
go
back
to
the
badiola
and
now
covered
with
our
rugs
she
sat
back
in
her
seat
motionless
exhausted
mute
my
brother
and
i
from
time
to
time
looked
at
her
with
uneasiness
the
coachman
whipped
up
his
horses
their
rapid
trot
resounded
on
the
road
bordered
here
and
there
by
blossoming
bushes
on
that
mild
april
evening
beneath
a
cloudless
sky
every
now
and
then
federico
and
i
asked
how
are
you
feeling
juliana
she
answered
so
so
a
little
better
are
you
cold
yes
a
little
she
answered
with
a
manifest
effort
one
would
almost
have
said
that
our
questions
irritated
her
so
much
so
that
finally
as
federico
persisted
in
engaging
her
in
conversation
she
said
excuse
me
federico
it
tires
me
to
speak
the
hood
had
been
lowered
and
juliana
was
in
the
shadow
invisible
buried
beneath
the
covers
twenty
times
i
bent
over
her
to
look
at
her
face
either
with
the
hope
that
she
was
napping
or
with
the
fear
that
she
had
collapsed
from
weakness
but
each
time
i
felt
the
same
sensation
of
surprise
and
of
fear
on
noticing
in
the
dark
that
her
eyes
were
wide
open
and
staring
there
was
a
long
silence
federico
and
i
were
also
silent
the
trot
of
the
horses
was
not
rapid
enough
to
suit
me
i
wanted
the
coachman
to
make
the
horses
gallop
faster
giovanni
it
was
almost
ten
o
clock
when
we
arrived
at
the
badiola
my
mother
awaited
us
very
much
worried
by
our
delay
when
she
saw
juliana
s
condition
she
said
i
knew
the
fatigue
would
hurt
her
juliana
tried
to
reassure
her
it
is
nothing
mother
you
will
see
morning
i
shall
be
well
i
am
just
a
little
tired
but
on
looking
at
her
in
the
light
my
mother
cried
out
alarmed
dio
your
face
frightens
me
you
can
t
stand
on
your
feet
edith
cristina
quick
run
upstairs
and
warm
the
bed
and
you
tullio
come
we
will
carry
her
juliana
resisted
obstinately
no
no
mother
it
is
nothing
do
not
be
frightened
i
will
go
to
tussi
with
the
carriage
and
bring
the
doctor
suggested
federico
i
will
be
back
in
half
an
hour
no
federico
no
cried
juliana
almost
violently
as
if
this
proposition
exasperated
her
i
do
not
wish
it
the
doctor
can
do
nothing
i
know
what
i
must
do
i
have
everything
upstairs
let
us
go
up
mother
dear
me
how
easily
you
are
alarmed
let
us
go
up
let
us
go
up
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
suddenly
recovered
her
strength
she
made
several
steps
without
assistance
going
up
the
stairs
my
mother
and
i
supported
her
but
in
her
room
she
had
an
attack
of
convulsive
vomiting
that
lasted
several
minutes
the
women
began
to
disrobe
her
go
out
tullio
leave
the
room
i
beg
of
you
she
said
you
may
return
later
mother
will
remain
with
me
do
not
be
uneasy
i
went
out
i
remained
in
an
adjoining
room
seated
on
a
divan
waiting
i
heard
the
hurried
movements
of
the
maids
i
was
being
consumed
with
impatience
when
may
i
return
when
may
i
find
myself
again
alone
with
her
i
will
watch
there
i
will
pass
the
entire
night
at
her
bedside
in
a
few
hours
perhaps
she
will
be
calmer
she
will
feel
better
i
will
stroke
her
hair
and
perhaps
succeed
in
lulling
her
to
sleep
who
knows
if
in
that
drowsiness
which
is
neither
wakefulness
nor
slumber
she
might
not
say
i
have
a
strange
confidence
in
the
efficacy
of
my
caresses
i
hope
yet
that
this
night
may
have
a
delightful
end
and
as
always
in
the
midst
of
the
anguish
that
the
thoughts
of
juliana
s
sufferings
caused
me
the
sensual
vision
acquired
determined
contours
became
a
clear
and
persistent
vision
as
her
in
the
light
of
the
lamp
that
burned
behind
the
curtains
of
the
alcove
she
awoke
after
a
first
very
short
slumber
looked
at
me
with
her
eyes
languishing
and
murmured
go
to
sleep
federico
entered
well
he
said
affectionately
it
seems
that
it
is
nothing
i
have
spoken
to
miss
edith
on
the
stairway
will
you
come
down
and
take
something
the
table
is
set
downstairs
no
i
am
not
hungry
now
later
on
perhaps
i
expect
to
be
called
if
i
am
not
required
i
will
go
go
federico
i
will
come
down
very
soon
thanks
i
glanced
after
him
as
he
withdrew
and
once
more
the
sight
of
my
good
brother
inspired
in
me
a
feeling
of
confidence
again
i
felt
my
heart
dilate
almost
three
minutes
passed
the
clock
on
the
wall
facing
me
ticked
off
the
time
with
the
beats
of
its
pendulum
the
hands
pointed
to
a
quarter
to
eleven
as
i
rose
impatiently
to
go
toward
juliana
s
room
my
mother
entered
agitated
and
said
in
a
low
voice
she
is
quieter
now
what
she
must
have
is
rest
poor
child
may
i
go
in
yes
but
don
t
disturb
her
as
i
made
a
motion
to
go
cut
my
mother
recalled
me
tullio
what
mother
she
seemed
to
hesitate
tell
me
have
you
seen
the
doctor
since
the
time
of
the
operation
yes
several
times
why
did
he
speak
about
the
she
hesitated
and
then
added
about
the
danger
juliana
might
run
by
a
new
pregnancy
i
had
not
spoken
to
the
doctor
and
i
did
not
know
what
to
answer
in
my
agitation
i
repeated
why
she
still
hesitated
have
you
not
noticed
that
juliana
is
pregnant
the
blow
was
too
sudden
for
me
to
be
able
at
first
to
grasp
the
truth
pregnant
i
stammered
my
mother
took
my
hands
well
well
tullio
i
did
not
know
you
frighten
me
so
the
yes
the
come
tullio
sit
down
she
made
me
sit
down
on
the
divan
she
looked
at
me
with
fear
waiting
for
me
to
speak
for
several
moments
although
she
was
before
my
eyes
i
ceased
to
see
her
then
suddenly
a
brutal
light
burst
in
on
my
mind
and
the
drama
was
all
clear
to
me
where
did
i
find
the
strength
to
resist
what
preserved
my
reason
without
doubt
i
drew
from
the
very
excess
of
my
pain
and
horror
the
heroic
sentiment
that
saved
me
i
said
i
did
not
told
me
perceived
is
a
the
doctor
thinks
there
is
still
some
that
is
why
the
news
has
made
this
impression
on
you
know
juliana
is
so
weak
however
the
doctor
did
not
say
it
was
the
operation
was
a
will
will
send
for
him
we
will
consult
yes
that
is
indispensable
but
are
you
sure
mother
has
juliana
told
you
i
noticed
it
myself
it
is
impossible
to
be
mistaken
up
to
within
the
last
two
or
three
days
juliana
denied
it
or
at
least
pretended
that
she
was
not
certain
knowing
how
easily
you
are
alarmed
she
begged
me
to
say
nothing
to
you
but
i
wanted
to
tell
know
juliana
she
takes
so
little
care
of
her
health
just
think
since
she
lives
here
instead
of
getting
better
she
seems
to
be
getting
worse
every
day
formerly
a
week
in
the
country
sufficed
to
make
a
new
woman
of
her
do
you
remember
yes
that
is
true
one
can
never
take
enough
precautions
you
must
write
immediately
to
doctor
vebesti
yes
at
once
as
i
felt
incapable
of
controlling
myself
longer
i
arose
and
added
i
ll
go
to
see
her
go
but
let
her
rest
let
her
remain
quiet
i
am
going
downstairs
i
ll
come
up
again
thank
you
mother
i
touched
her
forehead
with
my
lips
dear
boy
she
murmured
as
she
withdrew
i
stopped
on
the
threshold
of
the
door
opposite
turned
around
and
watched
her
gentle
and
still
erect
figure
disappear
i
felt
an
indescribable
sensation
similar
without
doubt
to
that
which
i
should
have
felt
had
the
entire
house
collapsed
about
me
in
an
explosion
in
me
about
me
all
fell
sank
irresistibly
into
an
abyss
who
has
not
at
times
heard
some
unfortunate
being
say
in
one
hour
i
lived
ten
years
it
is
something
inconceivable
well
i
understand
it
during
that
short
interview
with
my
mother
so
peaceful
apparently
had
i
not
lived
ten
years
the
acceleration
of
the
inner
life
of
man
is
the
most
prodigious
and
frightful
phenomenon
there
is
in
the
world
what
must
be
done
i
was
seized
by
frenzied
desires
to
flee
far
away
in
the
night
or
to
run
to
my
room
and
lock
myself
in
to
remain
alone
to
contemplate
my
ruin
to
review
its
extent
but
i
was
able
to
resist
it
was
on
that
night
that
the
superiority
of
my
nature
was
revealed
was
able
to
shake
off
every
atrocious
torture
of
my
most
virile
faculties
and
i
thought
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
none
of
my
actions
should
seem
singular
or
inexplicable
either
to
my
mother
or
to
my
brother
or
anyone
else
in
this
house
i
stopped
before
the
door
of
juliana
s
room
powerless
to
repress
the
physical
trembling
that
shook
me
but
the
sound
of
a
footstep
in
the
corridor
determined
me
to
resolutely
enter
miss
edith
emerged
from
the
alcove
on
tiptoe
she
made
me
a
sign
to
make
no
noise
and
said
in
a
low
voice
she
is
going
to
sleep
and
she
went
out
softly
closing
the
door
behind
her
the
lamp
burned
with
a
tranquil
and
even
light
suspended
from
the
centre
of
the
ceiling
across
a
seat
was
thrown
the
amaranthine
cloak
on
another
the
black
satin
corset
the
corset
that
at
the
lilacs
juliana
had
removed
during
my
brief
absence
across
another
chair
the
gray
gown
the
same
that
she
had
worn
with
so
much
distinction
in
the
beautiful
forest
of
flowering
lilacs
the
sight
of
these
objects
upset
me
so
that
i
felt
a
new
desire
to
flee
but
i
walked
toward
the
alcove
and
drew
aside
the
curtains
i
saw
the
bed
i
saw
the
dark
spot
on
the
pillow
made
by
the
hair
but
not
the
face
i
saw
the
form
of
the
body
huddled
up
beneath
the
covers
in
my
mind
the
brutal
truth
presented
itself
with
the
most
ignoble
reality
she
has
been
possessed
by
another
and
a
series
of
odious
physical
visions
passed
before
the
eyes
of
my
soul
those
eyes
that
i
had
not
the
power
to
close
and
these
were
not
only
the
visions
of
the
things
accomplished
but
also
those
that
must
necessarily
take
place
i
was
forced
to
see
with
inexorable
precision
what
was
about
to
happen
to
dream
my
ideal
who
could
have
imagined
a
more
cruel
punishment
and
all
was
true
all
was
when
the
pain
exceeds
the
strength
one
instinctively
seeks
in
doubt
a
momentary
extenuation
of
the
intolerable
suffering
one
thinks
perhaps
i
am
mistaken
perhaps
my
misfortune
is
not
such
as
it
appears
to
be
perhaps
this
excess
of
pain
is
groundless
and
to
prolong
the
respite
one
s
perplexed
intelligence
is
applied
to
gain
a
more
exact
idea
of
the
reality
but
i
i
had
not
a
single
moment
of
doubt
i
had
not
a
single
moment
of
incertitude
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
explain
the
phenomenon
that
developed
in
my
consciousness
which
had
become
extraordinarily
lucid
it
seemed
that
spontaneously
by
a
secret
process
realized
in
the
dark
sphere
of
the
inner
being
all
the
unperceived
symptoms
that
had
connection
with
the
horrible
thing
were
coördinated
to
form
a
logical
idea
complete
rational
definite
irrefutable
and
now
that
idea
manifested
itself
all
at
once
surged
up
in
my
consciousness
with
the
rapidity
of
a
fragment
of
cork
which
no
longer
retained
at
the
bottom
of
water
by
hidden
bonds
floats
to
the
surface
there
to
remain
insubmersible
every
symptom
every
proof
was
there
in
perfect
order
no
effort
was
needed
to
find
them
to
choose
them
to
group
them
insignificant
and
distant
facts
were
illuminated
by
a
new
light
fragments
of
recent
life
regained
their
color
the
unaccustomed
aversion
of
juliana
for
flowers
for
odors
her
strange
agitations
her
nauseas
her
sudden
pallors
that
sort
of
continual
preoccupation
visible
between
her
eyebrows
the
great
fatigue
indicated
by
certain
positions
and
besides
the
pages
marked
by
the
nail
in
the
russian
book
the
reproach
of
the
old
man
to
the
count
besoukhow
the
supreme
question
of
the
little
princess
lisa
and
that
gesture
with
which
juliana
had
taken
the
book
from
my
hands
and
then
the
scenes
at
the
lilacs
the
tears
the
sobs
the
ambiguous
phrases
the
sibylline
smiles
the
almost
mournful
ardors
the
volubility
of
language
almost
insane
the
evocation
of
these
signs
grouped
themselves
around
my
mother
s
words
were
engraved
in
the
centre
of
my
soul
my
mother
said
is
impossible
to
be
up
to
within
two
or
three
days
ago
juliana
had
denied
it
or
at
least
that
she
was
not
knowing
how
easily
you
are
alarmed
she
begged
me
to
say
nothing
to
you
the
truth
could
not
be
more
evident
henceforth
everything
was
certain
i
entered
the
alcove
and
approached
the
bed
the
curtains
fell
behind
me
the
light
became
feebler
anxiety
suspended
my
respiration
and
all
my
blood
stood
still
in
my
arteries
when
i
came
to
the
bedside
and
bent
over
to
see
more
closely
juliana
s
head
almost
hidden
by
the
sheet
i
do
not
know
what
would
have
occurred
at
this
moment
had
she
raised
her
face
and
spoken
was
she
asleep
the
forehead
only
as
far
as
the
eyebrows
was
visible
i
remained
there
for
several
minutes
standing
expectant
but
was
she
asleep
she
was
motionless
lying
on
her
side
from
the
mouth
hidden
by
the
sheet
not
the
slightest
sound
of
respiration
could
be
heard
the
forehead
only
as
far
as
the
eyebrows
was
uncovered
what
countenance
would
i
have
shown
had
she
perceived
my
presence
the
hour
was
poorly
chosen
to
interrogate
her
for
explanations
if
she
had
suspected
that
i
knew
all
to
what
extremities
might
she
not
have
been
carried
during
the
night
i
was
therefore
constrained
to
simulate
tenderness
i
was
compelled
to
affect
perfect
ignorance
to
persist
in
the
expression
of
sentiments
that
a
few
hours
ago
at
the
lilacs
had
been
spoken
in
the
most
gentle
words
this
evening
in
your
will
see
how
kind
i
will
be
i
will
put
you
to
sleep
all
night
long
you
will
sleep
on
my
heart
on
looking
around
me
distractedly
i
discovered
on
the
carpet
the
slender
and
polished
shoes
on
the
back
of
a
chair
the
long
silken
hose
the
satin
garters
another
object
of
secret
elegance
all
things
that
my
lover
s
eyes
had
already
delighted
in
and
the
jealousy
of
my
senses
gnawed
me
so
furiously
that
it
was
a
miracle
that
i
restrained
myself
from
throwing
myself
on
juliana
from
awakening
her
from
reviling
her
with
the
absurd
and
coarse
words
which
this
sudden
rage
inspired
in
me
i
withdrew
tottering
and
left
the
alcove
i
thought
with
blind
fright
how
will
it
end
i
was
inclined
to
go
away
i
will
go
will
tell
my
mother
that
juliana
is
asleep
that
her
slumber
is
very
calm
i
will
tell
her
that
i
need
rest
i
will
take
refuge
in
my
room
and
morning
but
i
remained
where
i
was
perplexed
incapable
of
crossing
the
threshold
assailed
by
a
thousand
fears
i
turned
again
toward
the
alcove
by
an
abrupt
movement
as
if
i
had
felt
a
look
fixed
on
me
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
curtains
were
waving
but
i
was
mistaken
and
yet
through
the
curtains
something
like
a
magnetic
shadow
came
and
penetrated
me
something
against
which
i
was
without
resistance
i
reëntered
the
alcove
with
a
shudder
juliana
still
lay
in
the
same
attitude
was
she
asleep
the
forehead
alone
as
far
as
the
eyebrows
was
uncovered
i
sat
down
near
the
bedside
and
waited
i
looked
at
that
forehead
white
as
the
sheet
delicate
and
pure
as
a
host
that
forehead
which
i
had
so
many
times
religiously
kissed
which
my
mother
s
lips
had
so
many
times
touched
not
the
slightest
stain
could
be
perceived
on
it
it
seemed
the
same
as
it
ever
was
yet
henceforth
nothing
in
the
world
could
remove
the
stain
which
my
soul
s
eyes
saw
on
that
white
brow
certain
words
which
i
had
spoken
in
the
exaltation
of
intoxication
recurred
to
my
memory
i
will
watch
over
you
i
will
read
on
your
face
the
dreams
that
you
will
dream
i
thought
also
she
repeated
at
every
moment
yes
i
wondered
what
life
does
she
lead
internally
what
are
her
projects
what
resolutions
has
she
made
and
i
looked
at
her
forehead
and
ceasing
to
consider
my
own
pain
i
applied
all
my
powers
to
picture
to
myself
her
pain
to
understand
her
pain
truly
her
own
despair
must
be
frightful
ceaseless
limitless
my
punishment
was
also
her
punishment
and
perhaps
more
fearful
punishment
still
for
her
than
for
me
over
there
at
the
lilacs
in
the
alley
on
the
bench
in
the
house
she
had
certainly
felt
the
sincerity
of
my
words
she
had
certainly
read
my
sincerity
in
my
face
she
had
believed
in
the
greatness
of
my
love
were
in
the
house
while
i
sought
you
afar
oh
tell
me
is
not
this
confession
worth
all
your
tears
do
you
not
wish
you
had
shed
even
more
many
more
so
as
to
purchase
this
certitude
yes
many
more
that
is
what
she
had
replied
with
a
sigh
that
really
had
appeared
to
me
divine
many
more
she
would
have
liked
to
shed
other
tears
she
would
have
liked
to
suffer
another
martyrdom
as
the
price
of
this
avowal
and
when
she
saw
at
her
feet
more
passionate
than
ever
the
man
so
long
lost
and
wept
for
when
she
saw
opening
before
her
an
unknown
paradise
she
had
felt
herself
to
be
impure
she
had
the
physical
sensation
of
her
impurity
she
had
held
my
head
on
her
breast
ah
it
is
truly
incomprehensible
why
her
tears
have
not
burned
my
face
that
i
have
been
able
to
drink
them
without
being
poisoned
i
relived
our
entire
day
in
an
instant
i
saw
again
all
the
changing
expressions
even
the
most
furtive
that
had
appeared
on
juliana
s
face
since
our
arrival
at
the
lilacs
i
understood
them
all
a
great
light
illuminated
me
oh
when
i
spoke
to
her
of
the
morrow
when
i
spoke
to
her
of
the
terrors
that
word
coming
from
my
lips
must
have
had
and
to
my
memory
recurred
the
short
dialogue
that
we
had
had
on
the
threshold
of
the
balcony
facing
the
cypress
she
had
repeated
in
a
very
low
voice
with
a
feeble
sigh
die
she
had
spoken
of
approaching
death
she
had
asked
what
would
you
do
if
i
died
suddenly
if
for
instance
i
died
later
on
in
our
room
she
had
cried
pressing
me
close
no
no
tullio
we
must
not
speak
of
the
future
think
of
of
the
passing
hour
by
such
actions
by
such
words
did
she
not
betray
a
resolution
of
death
a
tragic
design
it
was
evident
that
she
had
resolved
to
kill
herself
that
she
would
kill
herself
perhaps
this
very
night
even
before
the
inevitable
since
there
was
no
other
resource
for
her
when
the
fright
that
the
thought
of
this
imminent
peril
caused
me
had
subsided
i
reflected
what
would
have
the
gravest
consequences
juliana
s
death
or
her
preservation
since
the
ruin
is
irremediable
and
the
abyss
bottomless
an
immediate
catastrophe
would
perhaps
be
better
than
an
indefinite
continuation
of
the
frightful
drama
and
in
imagination
i
accompanied
the
phases
of
that
new
maternity
saw
the
new
being
procreated
the
intruder
who
bore
my
name
who
would
be
my
heir
who
would
usurp
my
mother
s
caresses
and
those
of
my
daughters
of
my
brother
assuredly
death
only
can
interrupt
the
fatal
course
of
these
events
but
would
the
suicide
remain
secret
by
what
means
would
juliana
take
her
life
if
it
were
proved
that
death
were
voluntary
what
would
my
mother
and
brother
think
what
a
blow
that
would
be
to
my
mother
and
maria
and
natalia
and
what
would
i
do
myself
the
truth
is
that
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
conceive
of
my
own
existence
without
juliana
i
loved
the
poor
creature
even
in
her
impurity
excepting
that
sudden
attack
of
anger
which
carnal
jealousy
had
provoked
in
me
i
had
never
yet
felt
against
her
any
emotion
whatever
of
hate
or
of
rancor
or
of
contempt
no
thought
of
vengeance
had
crossed
my
soul
on
the
contrary
i
felt
a
profound
compassion
for
her
i
accepted
since
the
beginning
all
the
responsibility
of
her
fall
a
proud
and
generous
sentiment
sustained
me
exalted
me
she
bent
her
head
beneath
my
blows
she
kept
silent
she
set
me
an
example
of
virile
courage
of
heroic
abnegation
now
it
is
my
turn
i
must
render
her
the
same
i
must
save
her
at
any
price
and
this
nobility
of
soul
this
good
impulse
came
to
me
from
her
i
drew
closer
to
look
at
her
she
still
remained
motionless
in
the
same
attitude
with
her
forehead
uncovered
i
thought
is
she
asleep
and
if
on
the
contrary
she
were
pretending
to
be
asleep
to
remove
every
suspicion
to
make
believe
that
she
is
quiet
that
she
may
be
left
alone
assuredly
if
it
is
her
project
not
to
live
until
the
morrow
she
is
seeking
by
every
means
to
favor
its
execution
she
simulates
slumber
if
her
sleep
were
real
she
would
not
be
so
quiet
so
calm
with
such
superexcited
nerves
as
she
has
i
must
shake
her
but
i
hesitated
if
she
were
really
asleep
sometimes
after
a
great
output
of
nerve
force
even
in
the
midst
of
the
rudest
moral
anxieties
one
sleeps
a
leaden
slumber
like
a
syncope
oh
that
she
may
slumber
until
and
that
she
may
arise
recovered
be
strong
enough
to
support
the
explanation
that
has
become
inevitable
between
us
i
looked
fixedly
at
that
brow
white
as
the
sheet
and
on
bending
over
a
little
more
i
remarked
that
it
was
dotted
with
perspiration
a
bead
of
perspiration
glistened
on
the
eyebrow
and
that
bead
suggested
to
me
the
idea
of
the
cold
sweat
that
indicates
the
action
of
narcotic
poisons
a
sudden
flash
of
suspicion
came
upon
me
morphine
instinctively
my
glance
turned
to
the
night
table
on
the
other
side
of
the
bed
to
look
for
the
small
bottle
marked
with
the
skull
and
familiar
symbols
of
death
there
on
the
table
were
a
water
bottle
a
glass
a
candlestick
a
handkerchief
several
glistening
pins
that
was
all
i
made
a
rapid
and
complete
examination
of
the
alcove
anguish
choked
my
throat
juliana
has
morphine
she
always
has
on
hand
a
certain
quantity
of
it
in
a
liquid
state
for
her
injections
i
am
sure
that
she
has
had
the
idea
of
poisoning
herself
where
has
she
hidden
the
little
bottle
engraved
in
my
mind
i
had
the
image
of
the
small
glass
vial
that
i
had
seen
in
juliana
s
hands
ornamented
with
the
sinister
label
that
pharmacists
use
in
order
to
indicate
a
toxic
my
excited
imagination
suggested
to
me
and
if
she
has
already
drunk
it
that
sweat
i
trembled
on
my
seat
and
i
felt
the
agitation
of
a
rapid
debate
but
when
how
she
has
not
been
left
alone
it
requires
only
an
instant
to
empty
a
bottle
yet
without
doubt
she
would
have
vomited
and
that
attack
of
convulsive
vomiting
just
now
when
she
arrived
at
the
house
premeditating
suicide
she
had
doubtless
carried
the
morphine
with
her
was
it
not
possible
that
she
had
drunk
it
before
arriving
at
the
badiola
in
the
carriage
in
the
dark
in
fact
she
had
prevented
federico
from
going
for
the
doctor
i
understood
but
imperfectly
the
symptoms
of
morphine
poisoning
in
my
ignorance
that
white
and
moist
brow
that
perfect
immobility
overwhelmed
me
i
was
on
the
point
of
arousing
her
but
if
i
am
mistaken
she
will
awake
and
what
will
i
have
to
say
to
her
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
first
word
that
the
first
look
exchanged
between
us
must
produce
on
me
an
extraordinary
effect
of
an
unforeseen
unimaginable
violence
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
would
not
have
the
power
to
control
myself
to
dissimulate
and
that
on
looking
at
me
she
would
divine
immediately
that
i
knew
all
and
then
i
strained
my
ear
hoping
and
fearing
my
mother
s
coming
and
then
i
would
not
have
trembled
so
strongly
on
raising
the
edge
of
a
shroud
to
see
the
face
of
a
dead
person
i
slowly
uncovered
juliana
s
face
she
opened
her
eyes
ah
is
it
you
tullio
her
voice
was
natural
and
i
most
unexpectedly
could
speak
were
you
asleep
i
said
avoiding
her
eyes
yes
i
dozed
off
then
i
awoke
you
forgive
me
i
wished
to
uncover
your
mouth
i
feared
that
your
breathing
might
be
the
coverlid
would
suffocate
you
yes
that
is
true
i
am
warm
now
too
warm
remove
one
of
the
coverings
please
i
rose
to
remove
one
of
the
covers
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
define
the
state
of
consciousness
in
which
i
accomplished
these
acts
in
which
i
pronounced
and
heard
these
words
while
present
during
these
incidents
and
which
happened
as
naturally
as
if
there
had
been
no
change
as
if
around
us
there
had
been
no
adultery
no
disenchantment
remorse
jealousy
fear
death
every
human
atrocity
is
it
very
late
she
asked
me
no
it
is
not
yet
midnight
is
mother
in
bed
no
not
yet
after
a
pause
and
you
not
going
to
bed
you
must
be
tired
i
knew
not
what
to
answer
should
i
reply
that
i
would
remain
ask
her
permission
to
stay
repeat
to
her
the
tender
words
that
i
had
spoken
in
the
armchair
in
room
at
the
lilacs
but
if
i
remained
how
would
pass
the
night
there
on
the
chair
watching
her
or
else
in
the
bed
near
her
what
attitude
should
i
take
should
i
be
able
to
dissimulate
to
the
end
she
went
on
you
had
better
go
i
need
nothing
all
i
want
is
rest
if
you
remain
it
would
not
do
me
any
good
you
had
better
go
tullio
but
you
might
want
something
no
and
besides
cristina
stays
with
me
i
will
lie
on
the
sofa
why
should
you
upset
yourself
you
are
very
tired
that
can
be
seen
in
your
face
and
besides
if
i
knew
you
were
there
i
could
not
sleep
be
good
tullio
morning
early
you
may
come
and
see
me
we
both
need
rest
now
complete
rest
her
voice
was
low
and
caressing
without
any
unusual
intonation
excepting
her
persistence
in
persuading
me
to
retire
she
exhibited
no
other
indication
of
the
fatal
preoccupation
she
seemed
crushed
but
calm
from
time
to
time
she
closed
her
eyes
as
if
slumber
weighted
down
her
eyelids
what
should
i
do
leave
her
but
it
was
precisely
her
calm
that
frightened
me
such
a
calm
could
only
come
to
her
from
the
fixity
of
her
resolution
what
to
do
everything
considered
my
very
presence
during
the
night
would
have
been
useless
if
she
had
prepared
for
suicide
and
provided
herself
with
the
means
she
could
without
any
difficulty
have
put
her
project
into
execution
was
that
means
really
morphine
and
where
had
she
hidden
that
little
vial
beneath
her
pillow
in
the
drawer
of
the
night
table
how
could
i
look
for
it
i
should
have
to
speak
to
say
unexpectedly
i
know
that
you
want
to
kill
yourself
but
what
a
scene
would
follow
i
could
not
have
kept
silent
about
the
rest
and
what
a
night
that
would
have
been
so
many
perplexities
exhausted
my
energy
dissolved
it
my
nerves
were
unstrung
the
physical
fatigue
rapidly
increased
my
entire
organism
arrived
at
that
condition
of
extreme
weakness
in
which
the
functions
of
the
will
are
on
the
point
of
being
suspended
in
which
the
actions
and
reactions
cease
to
correspond
or
cease
to
accomplish
their
end
i
felt
myself
incapable
of
resisting
any
longer
of
combating
of
accomplishing
no
matter
what
necessary
act
the
sensation
of
my
weakness
the
sensation
of
the
fatality
of
what
had
happened
and
what
was
about
to
happen
still
paralyzed
me
my
being
seemed
to
be
struck
by
a
sudden
torpor
i
felt
a
blind
desire
to
hide
myself
again
from
the
last
and
obscure
consciousness
of
my
being
in
short
my
anguish
led
to
this
desperate
thought
come
what
will
i
too
have
the
resource
of
death
yes
juliana
i
said
i
will
leave
you
in
peace
sleep
we
will
see
one
another
you
can
scarcely
keep
your
eyes
open
no
it
is
true
i
am
very
tired
goodnight
will
you
not
give
me
a
kiss
tullio
a
shudder
of
instinctive
repugnance
passed
through
my
body
i
hesitated
at
that
moment
my
mother
entered
what
you
are
awake
she
cried
yes
but
i
m
going
to
sleep
again
immediately
i
have
been
to
see
the
children
natalia
is
not
asleep
she
said
has
mamma
come
back
she
wanted
to
come
why
did
you
not
tell
edith
to
bring
her
to
me
is
edith
already
in
bed
no
good
night
juliana
i
interrupted
i
approached
her
and
bent
over
to
kiss
the
cheek
that
she
offered
me
raising
herself
a
little
on
her
elbow
good
night
mother
i
am
going
to
bed
my
eyes
are
closing
with
sleep
won
t
you
take
something
federico
is
still
waiting
for
you
no
mother
i
do
not
care
for
anything
good
night
i
also
kissed
my
mother
s
cheek
and
i
left
hastily
without
glancing
at
juliana
i
collected
the
little
strength
left
me
and
scarcely
had
i
crossed
the
threshold
than
i
began
to
run
to
my
room
fearing
to
fall
before
i
reached
the
door
i
threw
myself
on
my
bed
face
down
i
was
seized
by
that
spasm
which
precedes
great
paroxysms
of
tears
when
the
suffocation
of
anguish
is
about
to
burst
out
when
the
tension
is
about
to
be
relaxed
but
the
spasm
was
protracted
and
the
tears
did
not
come
it
was
horrible
suffering
an
enormous
weight
bore
my
members
down
a
weight
that
i
felt
not
at
the
surface
but
within
as
if
my
bones
and
muscles
had
become
masses
of
lead
and
my
brain
still
thought
on
and
my
consciousness
still
remained
vigilant
no
i
must
not
leave
her
no
i
must
not
agree
to
let
her
leave
me
thus
when
my
mother
retires
she
will
kill
is
sure
oh
the
sound
of
her
voice
when
she
expressed
the
desire
to
see
natalia
a
hallucination
suddenly
seized
upon
me
my
mother
left
the
chamber
juliana
sat
up
in
bed
and
listened
intently
then
certain
at
last
of
being
alone
she
took
the
bottle
of
morphine
from
the
night
table
she
did
not
hesitate
a
second
but
with
a
determined
gesture
emptied
it
at
one
gulp
covered
herself
again
with
the
bedclothes
and
lay
on
her
back
to
await
the
end
the
imaginary
vision
of
the
cadaver
acquired
such
an
intensity
that
like
one
demented
i
arose
i
made
three
or
four
turns
in
the
room
hurt
myself
against
the
furniture
stumbled
over
the
carpet
with
terrified
gestures
i
opened
a
window
the
night
was
calm
filled
with
the
monotonous
and
continuous
croaking
of
frogs
the
stars
were
twinkling
the
great
bear
scintillated
before
me
very
brightly
time
passed
i
remained
for
several
minutes
at
the
balcony
in
contemplation
my
eyes
fixed
on
the
great
constellation
that
to
my
troubled
sight
seemed
to
come
nearer
i
did
not
really
know
what
i
expected
my
mind
wandered
i
had
a
singular
sensation
of
the
space
of
that
immense
sky
suddenly
during
a
sort
of
irresolute
suspension
as
if
in
the
depth
of
unconsciousness
some
obscure
effluvium
had
acted
on
my
being
there
spontaneously
surged
up
in
me
the
question
that
i
had
not
as
yet
understood
have
you
done
to
me
and
the
vision
of
the
cadaver
for
an
instant
forgotten
reappeared
before
my
eyes
my
horror
was
such
that
without
knowing
what
i
wished
to
do
i
turned
about
left
the
room
precipitately
and
directed
my
steps
towards
juliana
s
room
i
met
miss
edith
in
the
corridor
where
did
you
come
from
edith
i
asked
i
saw
that
my
appearance
stupefied
her
i
took
natalia
to
signora
who
wished
to
see
her
but
i
had
to
leave
her
there
it
was
impossible
to
make
her
go
back
to
her
own
bed
she
cried
so
hard
that
signora
consented
to
keep
her
with
her
let
us
hope
that
maria
will
not
waken
up
ah
so
then
my
heart
beat
so
violently
that
i
could
not
speak
connectedly
then
natalia
is
sleeping
with
her
mother
yes
signor
and
us
go
and
see
maria
emotion
choked
me
that
night
at
least
juliana
was
safe
it
was
impossible
that
she
should
think
of
dying
with
her
little
girl
by
her
side
by
a
miracle
the
affectionate
caprice
of
the
child
had
saved
the
mother
may
god
bless
her
before
looking
at
maria
who
was
sleeping
i
looked
at
the
empty
bed
that
still
retained
the
impress
of
the
child
s
figure
i
felt
strange
desires
to
kiss
the
pillow
to
feel
if
the
depression
were
still
warm
edith
s
presence
embarrassed
me
i
turned
toward
maria
i
bent
over
her
holding
my
breath
i
looked
at
her
for
a
long
time
i
sought
one
by
one
the
known
resemblances
she
bore
toward
me
i
almost
counted
the
delicate
veins
that
could
be
seen
on
her
temple
cheek
and
neck
she
was
sleeping
on
one
side
her
head
thrown
back
so
as
to
display
the
whole
of
the
neck
beneath
the
raised
chin
the
teeth
fine
as
grains
of
pure
rice
disclosed
their
whiteness
through
the
mouth
the
eyelashes
long
like
those
of
her
mother
shed
a
shadow
over
the
hollows
of
the
eyes
that
extended
even
to
the
cheek
bones
the
delicacy
of
a
precious
flower
an
extreme
finesse
distinguished
these
infantile
traits
in
which
i
my
blood
refined
flow
had
i
ever
since
the
birth
of
these
two
creatures
felt
for
them
a
sensation
so
deep
so
sweet
so
sad
i
could
scarcely
tear
myself
away
from
there
i
would
have
liked
to
sit
down
between
the
two
little
beds
and
rest
my
head
on
the
edge
of
the
empty
one
to
await
thus
the
good
night
edith
i
said
as
i
left
my
voice
trembled
but
it
no
longer
trembled
in
the
same
manner
as
soon
as
i
reached
my
room
i
threw
myself
again
face
down
on
the
bed
and
at
last
i
burst
into
distracted
sobs
when
i
awoke
from
the
heavy
and
so
to
speak
brute
slumber
that
at
some
moment
during
the
night
had
suddenly
overwhelmed
me
i
could
scarcely
regain
an
exact
idea
of
the
reality
but
soon
my
mind
freed
from
the
nocturnal
exaltations
stood
face
to
face
with
the
cold
naked
implacable
reality
what
were
my
recent
anguishes
in
comparison
with
the
fright
that
invaded
me
then
one
must
live
and
that
had
the
same
effect
on
me
as
if
someone
had
presented
me
with
a
deep
cup
saying
if
you
wish
to
drink
if
you
wish
to
live
you
must
drain
into
this
cup
even
to
the
last
drop
the
blood
of
your
heart
a
repugnance
a
disgust
an
indefinable
repulsion
assailed
the
inmost
part
of
my
being
and
yet
i
must
live
i
must
too
accept
life
but
above
all
i
must
the
comparison
that
i
made
to
myself
between
this
actual
awakening
and
that
which
i
had
dreamed
and
hoped
for
the
evening
before
at
the
lilacs
contributed
also
to
revolt
me
it
is
impossible
i
thought
that
i
can
accept
such
a
situation
it
is
impossible
that
i
should
rise
dress
myself
leave
this
room
see
juliana
again
speak
to
her
continue
to
dissimulate
before
my
mother
that
i
should
wait
for
a
suitable
moment
for
a
definite
understanding
between
us
that
in
this
interview
i
should
establish
the
conditions
of
our
future
relations
that
is
impossible
but
what
then
destroy
with
one
blow
and
radically
all
that
was
suffering
in
me
deliver
myself
is
nothing
else
to
be
and
on
considering
the
facility
of
the
act
on
imagining
the
rapidity
of
its
execution
the
explosion
of
the
firearm
the
immediate
effect
of
the
ball
the
darkness
that
would
follow
i
felt
through
my
entire
body
a
singular
agonized
thrill
mingled
however
with
a
sensation
of
solace
almost
of
sweetness
is
nothing
else
to
be
and
in
spite
of
the
torment
that
the
anxiety
of
knowing
gave
me
i
thought
with
relief
that
i
should
have
nothing
to
know
that
that
anxiety
even
would
instantaneously
in
short
all
would
be
at
an
end
i
heard
a
knock
at
the
door
and
my
brother
s
voice
cried
are
you
not
up
yet
tullio
may
i
come
in
come
in
federico
he
entered
do
you
know
it
is
after
nine
o
clock
i
fell
asleep
very
late
and
i
was
very
tired
how
do
you
feel
so
so
mother
is
up
she
told
me
that
juliana
is
feeling
quite
well
shall
i
open
your
window
it
is
a
wonderful
day
he
opened
the
window
a
wave
of
fresh
air
filled
the
room
the
curtains
swelled
like
two
sails
outside
could
be
seen
the
azure
of
the
sky
do
you
see
the
bright
light
doubtless
disclosed
the
signs
of
my
distress
on
my
face
for
he
added
were
you
ill
too
last
night
i
think
i
was
a
little
feverish
federico
looked
at
me
with
his
clear
blue
eyes
and
at
that
moment
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
bore
on
my
soul
the
entire
burden
of
future
lies
and
dissimulations
oh
if
he
had
known
but
as
usual
his
presence
put
to
flight
the
cowardice
that
commenced
to
crush
me
down
a
false
energy
like
that
communicated
by
a
drop
of
cordial
restored
my
to
me
i
thought
how
would
he
have
acted
in
my
place
my
past
my
education
the
very
essence
of
my
nature
contradicted
every
probability
of
a
similar
occurrence
but
at
least
this
much
was
certain
in
case
of
a
misfortune
similar
or
dissimilar
he
would
have
displayed
the
conduct
of
a
strong
and
forgiving
man
he
would
have
heroically
faced
the
pain
he
would
have
preferred
to
sacrifice
himself
rather
than
to
sacrifice
the
other
let
me
feel
said
he
approaching
he
touched
my
forehead
with
his
open
palm
and
felt
my
pulse
it
has
left
you
it
seems
to
me
but
how
unsteady
your
pulse
is
let
me
get
up
federico
it
is
late
after
noon
i
am
going
to
the
assoro
woods
if
you
wish
to
come
i
will
have
orlando
saddled
for
you
do
you
remember
the
woods
how
unfortunate
that
juliana
is
not
well
otherwise
we
would
have
taken
her
with
us
she
could
see
the
ricks
on
fire
when
he
mentioned
juliana
it
seemed
as
if
his
voice
became
more
affectionate
softer
and
so
to
speak
more
fraternal
oh
if
he
had
known
tullio
i
am
going
to
work
when
will
you
begin
to
help
me
this
very
day
whenever
you
wish
he
began
to
laugh
what
enthusiasm
but
that
s
enough
i
will
see
you
at
work
tullio
he
went
out
with
his
light
and
free
step
for
he
was
always
stimulated
by
the
precept
inscribed
on
the
est
it
was
ten
o
clock
when
i
left
my
room
on
that
april
morning
the
bright
light
that
inundated
the
badiola
by
the
open
windows
and
balconies
made
me
timid
how
could
i
wear
my
mask
in
such
a
light
before
entering
juliana
s
apartment
i
wished
to
see
my
mother
you
rose
late
she
said
on
seeing
me
how
are
you
very
well
you
are
pale
i
think
i
had
a
little
fever
in
the
night
but
it
is
gone
now
have
you
seen
juliana
not
yet
she
wished
to
get
up
the
dear
girl
she
said
that
she
no
longer
feels
ill
but
her
face
i
am
going
to
her
you
must
not
neglect
to
write
to
the
doctor
do
not
listen
to
juliana
write
this
very
day
did
you
tell
her
that
i
yes
i
told
her
that
you
i
am
going
mother
i
left
her
in
front
of
her
great
closets
perfumed
with
orris
in
which
two
women
were
piling
the
beautiful
washed
linen
the
pride
of
the
hermils
maria
in
the
was
taking
her
lesson
from
miss
edith
and
the
chromatic
scales
rapid
and
even
succeeded
one
another
pietro
passed
the
most
faithful
of
the
servants
somewhat
bent
bearing
a
tray
of
glasses
that
resounded
because
his
arms
trembled
with
age
the
entire
badiola
bathed
in
air
and
light
had
an
aspect
of
tranquil
joy
there
was
an
atmosphere
of
goodness
shed
the
subtle
and
inextinguishable
smile
of
the
gods
lares
never
before
had
that
sensation
that
smile
penetrated
to
my
soul
so
deeply
and
that
great
peace
that
great
goodness
enveloped
the
ignoble
secret
which
juliana
and
i
were
condemned
to
keep
without
dying
of
it
and
now
i
thought
at
the
height
of
my
anguish
wandering
in
the
corridor
as
a
lost
stranger
might
have
done
incapable
of
directing
my
steps
toward
the
dreaded
place
as
if
my
body
refused
obedience
to
the
impulsions
imposed
upon
it
by
my
will
and
now
she
knows
that
i
know
the
truth
between
us
henceforth
all
dissimulation
is
useless
necessity
imposes
upon
us
to
face
one
another
to
speak
of
the
frightful
thing
but
it
is
impossible
that
this
meeting
should
take
place
this
morning
the
consequences
of
it
can
not
be
foreseen
and
now
more
than
ever
it
is
necessary
absolutely
necessary
that
not
one
of
our
actions
should
seem
singular
or
inexplicable
neither
to
my
mother
nor
to
my
brother
nor
to
anyone
else
in
this
house
my
agitation
of
last
evening
my
uneasiness
my
grief
can
be
explained
by
the
preoccupation
of
the
peril
of
juliana
s
condition
but
logically
in
others
eyes
such
preoccupation
should
make
me
more
tender
toward
her
more
zealous
more
eager
than
ever
my
prudence
must
be
extreme
i
must
avoid
a
scene
with
juliana
cost
what
it
may
i
must
avoid
any
occasion
of
remaining
with
her
but
i
must
also
find
without
delay
means
to
make
her
understand
the
feeling
that
determined
my
attitude
in
regard
to
her
the
intention
that
directs
my
conduct
and
if
she
persists
in
the
will
to
kill
herself
if
she
had
only
deferred
its
execution
a
few
hours
if
she
were
already
watching
for
an
opportune
moment
that
fear
cut
short
my
loitering
and
forced
me
to
action
i
resembled
one
of
those
oriental
soldiers
who
are
forced
into
battle
by
blows
of
a
cudgel
i
directed
my
steps
toward
the
on
seeing
me
maria
interrupted
her
scales
and
ran
toward
me
light
and
joyous
as
toward
a
liberator
she
had
the
grace
the
agility
the
lightness
of
winged
creatures
i
raised
her
in
my
arms
to
kiss
her
will
you
take
me
out
she
asked
i
am
tired
miss
edith
has
kept
me
here
for
an
hour
i
can
not
stand
any
more
take
me
out
with
you
let
us
go
for
a
walk
before
breakfast
where
wherever
you
like
let
us
go
then
and
see
mamma
first
yes
yesterday
you
were
at
the
lilacs
and
we
had
to
stay
at
the
badiola
it
was
you
you
alone
who
would
not
consent
mamma
was
quite
willing
naughty
papa
we
should
like
to
go
there
tell
me
how
you
amused
yourselves
the
child
prattled
on
like
a
bird
delightfully
the
ceaseless
chatter
kept
company
with
my
anguish
while
we
were
going
toward
juliana
s
apartment
i
hesitated
but
maria
knocked
at
the
door
crying
mamma
without
suspecting
my
presence
juliana
came
to
open
the
door
herself
she
saw
me
she
started
violently
as
if
she
had
seen
a
phantom
a
spectre
some
terrifying
thing
is
it
you
she
stammered
in
a
voice
so
low
that
i
scarcely
heard
her
and
while
she
spoke
her
lips
blanched
after
the
start
she
became
suddenly
more
rigid
than
a
hermes
and
there
on
the
threshold
we
looked
at
each
other
read
each
other
s
faces
for
an
instant
even
our
souls
were
fixed
upon
each
other
all
about
us
disappeared
between
us
all
was
said
all
was
understood
everything
was
decided
in
the
space
of
one
second
what
happened
next
i
do
not
know
i
can
not
remember
i
remember
that
for
some
time
i
had
an
intermittent
consciousness
so
to
speak
of
what
happened
with
a
succession
of
short
eclipses
it
was
it
seemed
to
me
a
phenomenon
analogous
to
that
which
results
from
the
enfeeblement
of
the
voluntary
attention
in
the
case
of
certain
patients
i
lost
the
faculty
of
being
attentive
i
no
longer
saw
i
no
longer
seized
the
sense
of
words
i
no
longer
understood
then
a
moment
later
i
recovered
that
faculty
examined
the
things
and
persons
about
me
i
became
attentive
and
conscious
juliana
was
seated
and
held
natalia
on
her
knees
i
too
had
taken
a
seat
and
maria
ran
from
her
to
me
from
me
to
her
incessantly
with
endless
prattle
provoking
her
sister
asking
us
a
number
of
questions
which
we
only
answered
by
a
nod
of
the
head
that
lively
chatter
broke
our
silence
in
one
of
the
fragments
of
the
phrases
that
i
noticed
maria
said
to
her
sister
ah
is
it
true
that
you
slept
with
mamma
last
night
yes
because
i
am
little
oh
well
it
s
my
turn
is
it
not
mamma
take
me
in
your
bed
mamma
juliana
did
not
smile
she
remained
silent
and
seemed
absorbed
she
had
on
her
knees
natalia
whose
shoulders
were
turned
toward
her
and
whose
arms
were
around
her
waist
her
joined
hands
rested
in
the
little
girl
s
lap
whiter
than
the
little
white
dress
on
which
they
reposed
taper
painful
so
painful
that
they
themselves
revealed
to
me
an
immensity
of
sorrow
juliana
remained
bent
and
as
natalia
s
head
brushed
her
mouth
she
seemed
to
press
her
lips
to
the
child
s
curls
in
such
a
manner
that
when
i
glanced
at
her
i
could
not
see
the
expression
of
her
eyes
but
saw
only
her
lowered
eyelids
somewhat
reddened
and
i
was
constantly
agitated
internally
by
this
as
if
through
them
i
could
distinguish
the
fixity
of
the
pupils
that
they
covered
was
she
waiting
for
me
to
say
something
were
inexpressible
words
rising
to
those
hidden
lips
when
finally
by
an
effort
i
conquered
the
condition
of
inertia
in
which
extraordinary
alternations
of
lucidity
and
darkness
had
succeeded
each
other
i
said
in
a
tone
of
voice
that
i
would
have
used
i
believe
in
continuing
a
conversation
already
begun
by
adding
new
words
to
words
already
said
slowly
mother
wants
me
to
send
for
doctor
vebesti
i
have
promised
to
write
i
will
write
she
did
not
raise
her
eyelids
she
remained
mute
maria
in
her
innocence
looked
at
her
with
surprise
then
she
looked
at
me
too
i
rose
to
go
out
after
lunch
i
will
go
with
federico
to
the
assoro
woods
shall
we
see
one
another
this
evening
on
my
return
she
made
no
movement
to
answer
then
i
repeated
in
a
voice
that
conveyed
a
thousand
things
understood
shall
we
see
one
another
this
evening
on
my
return
from
between
her
lips
hidden
among
natalia
s
curls
came
like
a
sigh
yes
in
the
violence
of
my
multiple
and
contrary
agitations
in
the
first
tumult
of
pain
beneath
the
menace
of
imminent
perils
i
had
not
yet
had
the
leisure
to
think
of
the
other
moreover
from
the
very
first
i
had
not
conceived
even
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
of
my
former
suspicion
in
my
mind
the
other
had
immediately
taken
the
form
of
filippo
arborio
and
from
the
first
outburst
of
carnal
jealousy
that
had
seized
me
in
the
alcove
it
was
his
abominable
image
which
was
coupled
with
that
of
juliana
in
a
series
of
horrible
visions
even
now
while
federico
and
i
trotted
toward
the
forest
along
the
banks
of
the
tortuous
river
contemplated
so
painfully
on
the
afternoon
of
holy
saturday
the
other
trotted
beside
us
between
my
brother
and
me
interposed
the
image
of
filippo
arborio
revived
by
my
hate
animated
by
my
hate
with
life
so
intense
that
on
regarding
it
with
a
of
i
felt
a
physical
spasm
something
similar
to
the
savage
quivering
that
i
had
more
than
once
felt
on
the
duelling
field
at
the
signal
of
attack
when
face
to
face
with
an
adversary
my
brother
s
presence
extraordinarily
increased
my
uneasiness
compared
with
federico
that
man
s
face
so
thin
so
nervous
so
feminine
grew
smaller
became
impoverished
seemed
contemptible
and
ignoble
to
me
beneath
the
influence
of
the
new
ideal
of
virile
strength
and
simplicity
that
my
brother
s
example
inspired
in
me
i
not
only
hated
but
i
despised
that
complicated
and
equivocal
being
who
yet
belonged
to
my
own
race
and
who
had
several
particularities
in
his
cerebral
constitution
in
common
with
me
to
which
his
works
of
art
bore
witness
i
pictured
to
myself
a
type
of
one
of
those
literary
men
affected
by
the
saddest
maladies
of
the
mind
a
libertine
cruelly
curious
hardened
by
the
habit
of
cold
analysis
of
the
warmest
and
most
spontaneous
passions
of
the
soul
accustomed
to
consider
every
human
creature
as
a
subject
of
pure
psychological
speculation
incapable
of
love
incapable
of
a
generous
action
of
an
abnegation
of
a
sacrifice
hardened
in
falsehood
enervated
by
disgust
lascivious
cynical
cowardly
such
was
the
man
who
had
seduced
juliana
but
who
had
certainly
not
loved
her
did
not
the
very
appear
in
the
dedication
written
on
the
of
in
that
emphatic
dedication
the
only
document
known
to
me
that
bore
on
the
relations
between
the
romancer
and
my
wife
to
take
by
assault
the
ivory
tower
to
corrupt
a
character
whom
public
opinion
declared
to
be
incorruptible
to
experiment
with
a
method
of
seduction
on
so
rare
a
subject
that
was
an
enterprise
difficult
but
full
of
attraction
entirely
worthy
of
the
refined
artist
the
abstractor
of
physiological
quintessence
who
had
written
true
and
the
more
i
thought
of
it
the
more
the
facts
appeared
to
me
in
their
ugliest
crudity
filippo
arborio
had
certainly
made
juliana
s
acquaintance
during
one
of
those
crises
when
the
woman
of
whom
people
say
she
has
a
soul
after
a
long
period
of
loneliness
feels
herself
overcome
by
poetical
aspirations
by
indefinable
desires
vague
those
phenomena
which
are
only
the
masks
that
disguise
passion
filippo
arborio
with
his
experience
had
divined
the
special
physical
state
of
the
woman
whom
he
coveted
and
had
made
use
of
the
most
appropriate
and
the
surest
method
that
is
to
say
he
had
spoken
of
the
ideal
of
superior
regions
of
mystical
alliance
while
his
thoughts
were
turned
in
more
material
channels
and
juliana
the
ivory
tower
the
great
silent
creature
made
of
ductile
gold
and
steel
the
unique
had
been
captured
by
the
old
trick
had
allowed
herself
to
be
taken
in
the
old
snare
had
she
also
obeyed
the
old
law
as
to
the
frailty
of
woman
a
horrible
irony
tortured
my
soul
i
seemed
to
have
not
in
the
mouth
but
in
the
heart
the
convulsion
caused
by
the
herb
that
produces
death
by
making
one
hysterical
with
laughter
i
spurred
my
horse
and
put
him
to
a
gallop
on
the
steep
bank
of
the
river
the
bank
was
dangerous
with
very
precipitous
bends
and
made
more
menacing
in
some
places
by
deep
holes
obstructed
in
others
by
the
branches
of
great
gnarled
trees
in
still
others
traversed
by
enormous
roots
close
to
the
ground
i
was
perfectly
conscious
of
the
peril
to
which
i
exposed
myself
yet
instead
of
tightening
the
rein
i
still
urged
the
beast
forward
not
with
the
intention
of
facing
death
but
because
i
sought
in
danger
a
respite
from
my
intolerable
torture
i
already
knew
the
efficacy
of
such
madness
ten
years
before
when
still
very
young
and
while
an
attaché
of
the
embassy
at
constantinople
in
order
to
overcome
an
attack
of
grief
caused
by
the
recollection
of
a
recent
passion
i
entered
on
horseback
one
moonlight
night
one
of
the
mussulman
cemeteries
crowded
with
tombs
and
i
rode
on
the
incline
of
polished
stones
exposing
myself
a
thousand
times
to
the
risk
of
a
fatal
fall
death
mounted
with
me
on
the
crupper
overshadowed
every
other
care
tullio
tullio
cried
federico
after
me
stop
stop
i
paid
no
attention
to
him
it
is
marvellous
that
a
dozen
times
i
escaped
crushing
in
my
forehead
against
the
horizontal
branches
it
is
marvellous
that
a
dozen
times
i
prevented
my
horse
from
stumbling
against
the
trunk
of
a
tree
a
dozen
times
at
difficult
passages
i
saw
a
certain
fall
into
the
river
that
glistened
beneath
my
feet
but
when
i
heard
another
gallop
behind
me
when
i
perceived
federico
was
following
me
with
loosened
rein
i
became
frightened
for
him
and
i
tightened
the
bit
suddenly
the
poor
animal
reared
up
remained
an
instant
upright
as
if
to
make
a
plunge
into
the
river
and
then
came
to
a
standstill
trembling
are
you
mad
cried
federico
to
me
when
he
came
up
to
me
very
pale
did
i
frighten
you
forgive
me
i
did
not
think
there
was
any
danger
it
was
to
try
the
horse
and
then
i
could
not
control
is
a
little
hard
in
the
mouth
orlando
hard
in
the
mouth
don
t
you
find
him
so
he
looked
at
me
fixedly
with
an
uneasy
expression
i
attempted
a
smile
his
unusual
pallor
pained
me
and
aroused
my
sympathy
i
do
not
understand
how
you
escaped
breaking
your
head
against
a
tree
i
can
not
imagine
how
it
is
you
were
not
thrown
and
you
to
follow
me
he
had
exposed
himself
to
the
same
peril
perhaps
to
a
still
greater
one
because
his
horse
was
heavier
and
he
had
had
to
put
him
at
his
full
speed
for
fear
of
not
joining
me
in
time
we
both
looked
back
at
the
distance
just
covered
it
is
a
veritable
miracle
he
said
to
get
out
of
the
assoro
is
almost
impossible
just
look
we
looked
down
at
the
deadly
river
that
rolled
beneath
our
feet
deep
shining
rapid
full
of
whirlpools
and
gulfs
the
assoro
ran
between
two
chalky
cliffs
with
a
silence
that
rendered
it
still
more
sinister
the
country
harmonized
with
that
treacherous
and
menacing
aspect
the
sky
which
early
in
the
afternoon
was
covered
with
vapors
was
now
overcast
with
diffused
reflections
of
the
tangle
of
reddish
brushwood
that
still
survived
to
the
spring
the
dead
leaves
mingled
with
the
growth
of
new
leaves
the
dried
brambles
with
the
green
shoots
the
dead
with
the
newly
born
vegetation
in
an
inextricable
symbolic
confusion
above
the
agitated
surface
of
the
river
above
that
incongruous
thicket
the
sky
blanched
faded
away
seemed
to
dissolve
an
unexpected
fall
and
i
should
have
ceased
to
think
i
should
have
ceased
to
suffer
i
should
have
ceased
to
support
the
weight
of
my
miserable
flesh
but
perhaps
i
should
have
dragged
my
brother
with
me
down
the
precipice
and
my
brother
s
life
is
a
model
of
nobleness
my
brother
is
a
man
i
escaped
by
a
miracle
as
he
escaped
by
a
miracle
my
madness
has
made
him
run
a
supreme
risk
with
him
would
have
disappeared
a
world
of
beauty
and
of
goodness
what
is
this
fatality
that
condemns
me
to
be
harmful
to
those
who
love
me
i
looked
at
federico
he
had
become
thoughtful
and
grave
i
did
not
dare
question
him
but
i
felt
a
poignant
remorse
at
having
grieved
him
of
what
was
he
thinking
on
what
reflections
did
his
agitation
feed
perhaps
he
had
divined
that
i
was
dissimulating
suffering
and
that
the
sole
cause
which
had
driven
me
to
my
perilous
race
was
the
spur
of
some
fixed
idea
we
followed
the
path
one
behind
the
other
step
by
step
then
we
turned
into
a
that
led
through
the
bush
and
as
it
was
wide
enough
we
trotted
side
by
side
while
our
horses
whinnied
bringing
their
nostrils
together
as
if
to
exchange
confidences
and
mingling
the
froth
from
their
bridles
from
time
to
time
i
glanced
at
federico
and
seeing
that
he
was
still
pensive
i
thought
assuredly
if
i
were
to
reveal
the
truth
to
him
he
would
not
believe
me
he
could
not
believe
in
juliana
s
sin
in
the
sister
s
stain
between
his
affection
and
that
of
my
mother
for
juliana
i
really
could
not
decide
whose
is
the
more
profound
had
he
not
always
kept
on
his
table
the
two
portraits
of
juliana
and
our
poor
constance
united
as
in
a
diptych
for
the
same
adoration
this
morning
even
how
gentle
his
voice
became
in
naming
her
suddenly
by
contrast
the
infamous
image
reappeared
more
hideous
the
bared
chest
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
in
the
of
the
flitted
now
before
my
imagination
and
on
that
face
my
hate
worked
just
like
nitric
acid
on
the
engraver
s
copper
plate
the
bitten
characters
became
sharper
and
sharper
then
while
i
still
felt
in
my
blood
the
excitement
produced
by
the
ride
by
the
effect
of
that
exuberance
of
physical
courage
of
that
instinct
of
hereditary
combativeness
that
so
often
surged
up
in
me
at
the
contact
with
other
men
i
felt
that
i
would
not
have
the
strength
to
resist
challenging
filippo
arborio
i
will
go
to
rome
i
will
find
out
all
about
him
i
will
incense
him
no
matter
how
i
will
force
him
to
fight
i
will
do
everything
to
kill
him
or
cripple
him
i
imagined
the
poltroon
to
myself
there
recurred
to
my
memory
a
rather
ridiculous
retreat
which
he
had
not
been
able
to
prevent
at
the
salle
d
armes
when
he
received
a
thrust
in
the
breast
from
the
i
also
remembered
his
questioning
me
regarding
my
duel
that
puerile
curiosity
of
those
who
have
never
been
on
the
field
of
honor
i
recalled
that
during
my
assault
he
had
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
me
ceaselessly
the
consciousness
of
my
superiority
the
certainty
of
vanquishing
him
excited
me
in
my
imagination
a
thread
of
red
blood
furrowed
that
pale
and
disgusting
flesh
and
i
saw
him
bleeding
and
inert
on
a
mattress
with
two
doctors
leaning
over
him
how
often
i
the
ideologist
the
analyst
the
sophist
of
an
epoch
of
decadence
had
prided
myself
on
being
the
descendant
of
that
raymond
hermil
of
panedo
who
at
the
goulette
had
accomplished
prodigies
of
valor
and
of
ferocity
beneath
the
eyes
of
charles
the
fifth
the
excessive
development
of
my
intelligence
and
of
my
state
had
not
been
able
to
modify
the
depths
of
my
substance
in
the
deepest
stratifications
of
which
were
preserved
the
imprint
of
every
hereditary
characteristic
of
my
race
in
my
brother
whose
organization
was
well
balanced
thought
was
always
associated
with
labor
in
me
thought
predominated
i
was
in
short
a
violent
and
a
passionate
person
conscious
of
himself
in
whom
the
hypertrophy
of
certain
cerebral
centres
rendered
impossible
the
coördination
necessary
to
the
normal
state
of
the
mind
i
was
able
to
contemplate
my
actions
with
perfect
and
yet
i
had
every
undisciplinable
impulse
of
primitive
natures
more
than
once
had
i
been
possessed
by
sudden
criminal
ideas
more
than
once
i
had
been
surprised
by
feeling
the
surging
up
of
a
cruel
instinct
within
me
there
are
the
said
my
brother
to
me
putting
his
horse
at
a
trot
the
blows
of
the
axe
could
be
heard
in
the
forest
and
the
spirals
of
smoke
could
be
seen
rising
between
the
trees
federico
interrogated
the
workmen
as
to
the
progress
made
in
their
labor
gave
them
advice
while
examining
their
work
with
an
experienced
eye
every
one
of
them
assumed
a
respectful
attitude
and
listened
attentively
around
about
the
labor
seemed
to
become
more
eager
easier
lighter
and
even
the
crackling
of
the
fire
more
efficacious
men
ran
right
and
left
throwing
earth
here
and
there
wherever
the
smoke
poured
out
in
too
great
abundance
to
stop
up
with
clods
the
holes
caused
by
the
explosions
they
ran
they
shouted
with
these
rude
voices
mingled
the
guttural
sounds
of
the
the
surroundings
resounded
with
the
crash
of
some
falling
tree
during
the
few
moments
of
our
halt
could
be
heard
the
whistling
of
blackbirds
and
the
great
motionless
forest
contemplated
the
to
whom
its
life
served
as
food
while
my
brother
proceeded
in
his
examination
of
the
work
i
withdrew
leaving
to
my
horse
the
choice
of
the
unfamiliar
paths
that
led
into
the
bush
behind
me
the
sounds
decreased
the
echoes
died
away
a
heavy
silence
fell
from
the
i
thought
what
shall
i
do
to
regain
courage
what
will
my
life
henceforth
be
can
i
continue
to
live
in
my
mother
s
house
with
my
secret
can
i
associate
my
life
with
that
of
federico
what
man
in
all
this
world
what
event
could
ever
resuscitate
in
my
soul
a
spark
of
faith
the
sounds
of
the
workers
away
behind
me
the
solitude
became
complete
to
work
to
accomplish
good
to
live
for
others
i
recover
in
these
things
the
true
sense
of
life
and
are
there
really
only
these
things
which
to
the
exclusion
of
individual
happiness
permit
of
finding
the
true
sense
of
life
the
other
day
while
my
brother
was
speaking
i
believed
i
understood
his
remarks
i
believed
that
the
of
was
revealed
to
me
by
his
mouth
the
doctrine
of
truth
according
to
my
brother
is
not
in
laws
not
in
precepts
but
simply
and
solely
in
the
interpretation
that
man
gives
to
life
it
seemed
to
me
i
had
understood
it
fully
but
all
at
once
i
now
found
myself
fallen
back
among
the
shadows
i
had
become
blind
again
i
no
longer
understood
what
man
in
all
the
world
what
event
could
console
me
for
all
the
good
i
had
lost
and
the
future
seemed
frightful
and
hopeless
to
me
the
undefined
image
of
the
infant
to
be
born
grew
enlarged
like
horrible
and
formless
things
one
sees
sometimes
in
a
nightmare
and
ended
by
enveloping
everything
it
was
no
longer
a
question
of
regret
of
remorse
of
an
indestructible
recollection
of
no
matter
what
inner
bitterness
it
now
concerned
a
living
being
my
future
was
fettered
to
a
being
whose
life
was
tenacious
and
malefic
it
was
shackled
to
a
stranger
to
an
intruder
to
an
abominable
creature
against
whom
not
only
my
mind
but
also
my
flesh
all
my
blood
and
every
fibre
rose
with
a
brutal
ferocious
implacable
aversion
until
death
beyond
death
i
thought
who
could
have
imagined
a
worse
torture
for
torturing
the
soul
and
the
flesh
at
the
same
time
and
it
was
just
at
the
time
that
the
nausea
set
in
that
fed
on
dreams
who
drank
of
the
the
ingenuities
of
my
adolescence
thought
of
nothing
but
of
gathering
flowers
oh
those
flowers
those
flowers
that
i
so
timidly
offered
her
and
after
a
great
intoxication
i
received
the
delightful
news
from
whom
from
my
mother
and
after
the
news
i
experience
a
feeling
of
generous
exaltation
i
accept
in
good
faith
a
noble
rôle
i
sacrifice
myself
in
silence
like
one
of
octave
feuillet
s
heroes
what
heroism
the
irony
tortured
my
soul
bruised
every
fibre
then
for
the
second
time
i
conceived
the
mad
idea
of
escaping
from
my
fate
i
looked
before
me
close
at
hand
between
the
unreal
like
the
illusion
of
a
hallucination
shone
the
glistening
assoro
strange
i
thought
with
a
curious
shudder
up
to
this
time
i
had
not
noticed
that
my
horse
left
to
himself
had
entered
a
path
that
led
to
the
river
the
assoro
seemed
to
have
a
fatal
fascination
for
me
i
hesitated
a
moment
between
two
go
on
as
far
as
the
cliff
or
return
finally
i
stopped
fascinated
by
the
water
and
the
guilty
thought
i
made
my
horse
curvet
a
heavy
oppressiveness
succeeded
the
internal
convulsion
it
seemed
to
me
that
all
at
once
my
soul
had
become
a
poor
faded
thing
a
bruised
diminished
miserable
thing
i
became
softened
i
felt
pity
for
myself
i
felt
pity
for
juliana
i
felt
pity
for
every
creature
upon
whom
suffering
had
set
its
seal
that
trembled
under
the
embrace
of
life
as
some
vanquished
enemy
in
the
power
of
some
pitiless
conqueror
what
are
we
what
do
we
know
what
do
we
wish
for
no
one
has
ever
obtained
what
he
would
like
no
one
will
ever
obtain
what
he
would
like
we
seek
goodness
virtue
enthusiasm
the
passion
that
will
fill
our
soul
the
faith
that
will
calm
our
inquietudes
the
inspiration
that
will
give
us
courage
the
work
to
which
we
consecrate
ourselves
the
cause
for
which
we
will
joyfully
die
and
the
result
of
so
many
efforts
is
an
empty
lassitude
the
sensation
of
strength
spent
in
pure
loss
and
of
the
flight
of
time
at
that
moment
life
appeared
to
me
like
a
distant
vision
confused
strange
monstrous
madness
imbecillity
poverty
blindness
every
malady
every
misfortune
the
obscure
and
continuous
agitation
of
unconscious
atavic
bestial
powers
in
the
depths
of
our
substance
the
highest
manifestations
of
the
fugitive
mind
necessarily
subordinated
to
a
physical
condition
connected
with
the
functions
of
an
organ
instantaneous
metamorphoses
produced
by
an
imperceptible
cause
by
a
mere
nothing
the
infallible
amount
of
egotism
in
the
noblest
actions
the
inutility
of
so
much
moral
energy
directed
toward
an
uncertain
object
the
futility
of
amours
that
we
believe
to
be
eternal
the
frailty
of
virtue
that
we
believe
unshakable
the
feebleness
of
the
most
robust
wills
every
shame
every
misery
appeared
before
me
in
that
instant
how
is
it
possible
to
live
how
is
it
possible
to
love
the
axes
resounded
in
the
forest
a
short
and
savage
cry
accompanied
every
blow
here
and
there
in
the
clearings
great
piles
of
wood
in
the
form
of
truncated
cones
or
of
quadrangular
pyramids
were
smoking
columns
of
smoke
thick
and
straight
as
the
trunks
of
trees
arose
in
the
quiet
air
to
me
everything
was
symbolical
at
that
moment
i
turned
my
horse
toward
the
neighboring
where
i
had
recognized
federico
he
had
descended
from
his
horse
and
was
speaking
to
a
tall
old
man
with
shaven
chin
ah
at
last
he
cried
on
seeing
me
i
was
afraid
that
you
were
lost
no
i
was
not
far
off
let
me
introduce
to
you
giovanni
di
man
he
said
placing
his
hand
on
the
old
man
s
shoulder
i
looked
at
the
being
whom
he
so
designated
a
singularly
sweet
smile
gathered
around
his
withered
mouth
i
had
never
seen
such
sad
eyes
before
under
a
human
brow
adieu
giovanni
and
keep
up
your
courage
added
my
brother
in
that
voice
which
seemed
at
certain
moments
like
certain
liquors
to
have
the
power
of
stimulating
the
vital
tone
as
for
us
tullio
let
us
return
to
the
badiola
it
is
getting
late
they
will
be
waiting
for
us
he
remounted
his
horse
he
again
saluted
the
old
man
on
passing
by
the
furnaces
he
once
more
instructed
the
workmen
concerning
the
operations
of
the
coming
night
on
which
the
was
to
take
place
we
then
trotted
off
side
by
side
the
blue
sky
slowly
appeared
over
our
heads
the
veils
of
vapor
floated
away
dispersed
reformed
in
such
a
manner
that
the
azure
seemed
to
pale
progressively
as
if
through
its
limpidity
a
continuous
milky
wave
was
spread
and
extended
we
were
nearing
the
hour
when
the
evening
before
at
the
lilacs
i
had
contemplated
with
juliana
the
undulating
garden
in
its
ideal
light
around
us
the
brushwood
began
to
be
gilded
the
invisible
birds
were
warbling
did
you
take
good
notice
of
that
old
man
giovanni
di
scordio
asked
federico
yes
i
replied
i
do
not
think
i
shall
ever
forget
his
smile
or
his
eyes
that
old
man
is
a
saint
pursued
federico
no
man
has
worked
or
suffered
so
much
as
he
has
he
had
fourteen
sons
and
all
one
after
the
other
have
left
him
just
as
ripe
fruit
leaves
the
tree
his
wife
a
virago
is
dead
he
is
left
alone
his
sons
have
despoiled
and
disowned
him
he
has
experienced
every
human
ingratitude
he
has
experienced
the
perversity
not
of
strangers
but
of
his
own
creations
do
you
understand
his
own
blood
has
turned
to
venom
in
the
beings
for
whom
he
had
only
love
and
affection
in
the
beings
whom
he
has
not
ceased
to
love
whom
he
can
not
curse
whom
he
will
certainly
bless
at
the
hour
of
his
death
even
if
they
permit
him
to
die
in
solitude
is
not
such
obstinacy
of
man
in
his
goodness
an
extraordinary
an
almost
unbelievable
thing
after
so
much
suffering
his
face
still
has
the
smile
that
you
saw
will
do
well
tullio
not
to
forget
that
the
hour
of
trial
was
drawing
near
the
hour
dreaded
yet
desired
at
the
same
time
juliana
was
ready
she
had
firmly
opposed
maria
s
caprice
she
wished
to
be
alone
in
her
room
to
await
me
what
shall
i
say
to
her
what
will
she
say
to
me
what
will
be
my
attitude
towards
her
all
my
prejudices
all
my
plans
were
scattered
there
remained
to
me
only
an
intolerable
anguish
who
could
foresee
the
result
of
the
meeting
i
neither
felt
master
of
myself
nor
of
my
words
nor
of
my
acts
i
only
felt
within
me
a
fermentation
of
obscure
thoughts
that
at
the
slightest
shock
would
surge
up
never
as
at
that
moment
had
i
had
the
clear
and
hopeless
consciousness
of
the
intestine
discords
that
rent
me
the
perceptions
of
the
irreconcilable
elements
that
warred
at
the
depths
of
my
being
that
overthrew
one
another
that
destroyed
each
other
by
turns
in
a
perpetual
conflict
rebellious
to
all
restraint
to
the
dejection
of
my
mind
was
added
a
particular
agitation
of
my
feelings
produced
by
the
images
which
on
that
day
had
ceaselessly
tortured
me
i
knew
that
agitation
well
i
knew
it
but
too
well
i
knew
it
was
more
certain
than
any
other
thing
to
stir
up
the
muddy
depths
in
man
i
knew
but
too
well
that
base
concupiscence
from
which
nothing
can
save
dreadful
sexual
fever
which
for
months
had
held
me
chained
to
a
despised
and
odious
woman
teresa
raffo
and
now
the
sensations
of
goodness
of
pity
and
of
strength
that
were
necessary
to
me
to
enable
me
to
support
a
meeting
with
juliana
and
to
persist
in
my
original
project
died
away
in
me
like
moving
mists
over
a
swamp
of
mire
it
lacked
but
little
of
midnight
when
i
left
my
room
to
go
to
juliana
s
every
sound
had
ceased
the
badiola
reposed
in
profound
silence
i
listened
intently
and
it
seemed
to
me
i
heard
the
calm
respiration
of
my
mother
of
my
brother
of
my
daughters
those
innocent
and
spotless
beings
i
thought
i
saw
the
face
of
maria
again
sleeping
as
i
had
seen
it
the
night
before
i
imagined
i
saw
the
other
faces
with
an
expression
of
repose
of
peace
of
goodness
on
each
a
sudden
tenderness
seized
me
the
feeling
of
happiness
experienced
but
for
a
moment
the
evening
before
and
then
eclipsed
threw
a
great
light
over
my
mind
if
nothing
had
happened
if
i
had
remained
under
the
illusion
what
a
night
that
would
have
been
i
would
have
gone
to
juliana
as
to
a
divine
being
and
what
could
i
have
wished
sweeter
than
that
silence
to
envelop
the
inquietude
of
my
love
i
traversed
the
room
in
which
the
evening
before
i
had
received
from
my
mother
s
mouth
the
unexpected
revelation
again
i
heard
the
ticking
of
the
clock
that
had
marked
the
hour
and
i
do
not
know
why
that
tick
tack
so
invariably
equal
increased
my
anguish
i
do
not
know
why
but
i
imagined
i
felt
juliana
s
anguish
respond
to
mine
through
the
space
that
still
separated
us
and
that
the
palpitations
of
our
hearts
were
accelerated
in
unison
i
walked
straight
before
me
without
further
stopping
without
seeking
to
muffle
the
sound
of
my
footfalls
i
did
not
knock
at
the
door
i
opened
it
and
entered
juliana
was
standing
supporting
herself
with
one
hand
on
the
corner
of
a
table
motionless
more
rigid
than
a
hermes
i
can
still
see
everything
nothing
at
that
hour
escaped
me
nothing
eluded
my
attention
the
actual
world
had
vanished
there
subsisted
but
a
fictitious
world
in
the
midst
of
which
i
panted
with
anguish
with
oppressed
heart
incapable
of
articulating
a
syllable
and
yet
singularly
lucid
as
if
i
had
been
a
spectator
at
a
theatre
on
the
table
burned
a
candle
which
lent
a
sort
of
visible
reality
to
this
semblance
of
scenic
fiction
because
the
little
flickering
flame
seemed
to
shed
about
it
that
vague
horror
which
the
actors
in
a
drama
diffuse
in
the
ambient
air
with
their
great
gestures
of
despair
or
menace
the
strange
sensation
disappeared
when
finally
powerless
to
longer
support
that
silence
and
juliana
s
immobility
i
spoke
the
first
words
there
was
nothing
in
my
voice
of
the
sound
that
i
believed
it
would
have
when
i
would
open
my
lips
without
wishing
it
i
spoke
in
a
gentle
trembling
almost
timid
voice
were
you
waiting
for
me
she
kept
her
eyes
cast
down
without
raising
them
she
answered
yes
i
looked
at
her
arm
as
motionless
as
marble
which
seemed
to
become
more
and
more
rigid
upon
the
hand
placed
on
the
corner
of
the
table
i
feared
that
that
fragile
support
on
which
she
leaned
her
entire
weight
would
yield
from
one
moment
to
another
and
that
she
would
fall
you
know
why
i
came
i
continued
with
extreme
slowness
plucking
the
words
from
my
heart
one
by
one
she
remained
silent
is
it
true
i
went
on
is
it
i
have
learned
from
my
mother
she
still
remained
silent
she
seemed
to
be
gathering
all
her
strength
strange
during
that
interval
it
did
not
seem
absolutely
impossible
that
she
would
answer
no
she
answered
and
i
heard
less
the
sound
of
her
words
than
i
saw
them
outlined
by
her
bloodless
lips
it
is
true
it
was
a
ruder
shock
perhaps
than
that
given
me
by
my
mother
s
words
of
course
i
knew
all
i
had
already
lived
hours
with
my
certitude
and
yet
this
confirmation
so
clear
so
precise
crushed
me
to
earth
as
if
it
were
the
first
time
i
had
heard
the
revelation
of
the
irreparable
truth
it
is
true
i
repeated
instinctively
speaking
to
myself
with
a
sensation
analogous
to
that
which
i
would
have
had
had
i
found
myself
living
and
conscious
at
the
bottom
of
an
abyss
then
juliana
raised
her
eyes
and
fixed
them
on
mine
with
a
sort
of
spasmodic
violence
tullio
she
said
listen
a
choking
stopped
the
voice
in
her
throat
listen
i
know
what
i
must
do
i
was
prepared
for
anything
to
spare
you
this
but
destiny
willed
that
i
live
until
now
to
suffer
that
most
horrible
thing
the
thing
of
which
i
had
a
mad
you
understand
thousand
times
more
than
of
death
tullio
tullio
your
another
suffocation
choked
her
at
a
moment
when
her
voice
had
become
so
distressed
in
tone
that
it
gave
me
the
physical
impression
of
the
tearing
out
of
the
most
hidden
fibres
i
dropped
into
a
seat
covered
my
face
with
my
hands
and
waited
for
her
to
continue
i
should
have
died
before
now
i
should
have
died
long
ago
without
doubt
it
would
have
been
better
if
i
had
not
come
to
the
badiola
it
would
have
been
better
if
at
your
return
from
venice
you
had
not
come
to
me
again
i
would
have
been
dead
and
you
would
not
have
known
this
shame
you
would
have
regretted
me
perhaps
you
would
always
have
cherished
my
memory
perhaps
i
should
always
have
remained
your
great
love
your
unique
love
as
you
said
yesterday
i
did
not
fear
death
you
know
i
do
not
fear
it
it
is
the
thought
of
our
two
little
daughters
and
of
our
mother
that
has
made
me
postpone
the
execution
from
day
to
day
and
that
has
been
an
agony
tullio
a
cruel
agony
in
which
i
have
consumed
not
one
but
a
thousand
lives
and
i
am
still
alive
after
a
pause
she
added
how
is
it
possible
that
with
such
poor
health
i
have
so
much
resistance
to
pain
that
also
is
a
misfortune
for
me
think
of
it
in
consenting
to
accompany
you
here
i
thought
it
is
certain
that
i
shall
become
ill
directly
i
arrive
i
shall
have
to
go
to
my
bed
and
i
shall
rise
from
it
no
more
they
will
think
i
died
a
natural
death
tullio
will
never
know
anything
will
never
suspect
anything
everything
will
be
on
the
contrary
i
am
still
alive
and
you
know
all
and
all
is
lost
without
hope
she
spoke
in
a
low
voice
very
feebly
and
yet
in
as
a
tone
as
if
it
were
a
sharp
and
reiterated
cry
i
pressed
my
temples
and
felt
them
throbbing
so
violently
that
i
was
almost
afraid
as
if
the
arteries
would
burst
the
skin
and
their
soft
and
warm
membrane
adhere
naked
to
the
cranial
wall
my
only
preoccupation
was
to
hide
the
truth
from
you
not
for
myself
but
for
you
for
your
good
you
will
never
know
what
terrors
have
frozen
me
what
anguish
has
choked
my
throat
since
the
day
we
arrived
here
up
to
yesterday
you
have
hoped
you
have
dreamed
you
have
been
almost
happy
but
my
life
to
me
in
this
blessed
house
in
contact
with
your
mother
with
my
secret
can
you
imagine
it
yesterday
at
the
lilacs
while
we
were
at
table
during
that
sweet
chat
which
tortured
me
you
said
to
me
you
knew
nothing
you
perceived
oh
no
that
is
false
i
knew
all
i
divined
all
and
when
i
detected
the
affectionate
look
in
your
eyes
i
felt
my
soul
grow
faint
listen
tullio
what
i
am
going
to
say
is
the
truth
the
real
truth
i
am
before
you
here
as
on
my
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
lie
believe
what
i
tell
you
i
do
not
care
to
exculpate
myself
i
do
not
dream
of
defending
myself
henceforth
all
is
at
an
end
but
i
wish
to
tell
you
one
thing
because
it
is
true
you
know
what
love
i
have
had
for
you
since
the
day
we
first
met
for
years
for
years
i
was
blindly
devoted
and
not
only
during
the
years
of
happiness
but
also
during
the
years
of
misery
when
your
love
grew
weary
you
know
it
tullio
you
could
always
do
with
me
as
you
wished
you
have
always
found
in
me
the
friend
the
sister
the
wife
the
mistress
ready
to
make
no
matter
what
sacrifice
to
please
you
do
not
believe
tullio
do
not
believe
that
i
recall
my
long
devotion
in
order
to
accuse
you
no
no
there
is
not
in
my
soul
a
single
drop
of
bitterness
against
you
do
you
hear
not
a
single
drop
but
let
me
now
remind
you
of
a
devotion
and
a
tenderness
that
have
lasted
for
so
many
years
let
me
speak
to
you
of
love
of
the
of
my
without
any
intermission
do
you
understand
me
one
intermission
i
believe
that
my
passion
for
you
has
never
been
as
ardent
as
during
the
last
few
weeks
yesterday
you
told
me
many
things
ah
what
could
not
i
too
tell
of
my
life
during
these
last
few
days
i
knew
all
i
divined
all
and
i
was
compelled
to
avoid
you
how
many
times
have
i
been
on
the
point
of
falling
in
your
arms
of
closing
my
eyes
and
yielding
myself
entirely
to
you
in
my
moments
of
feebleness
and
extreme
lassitude
the
other
morning
saturday
morning
when
you
came
in
with
the
flowers
it
seemed
to
me
as
i
looked
at
you
that
i
saw
the
lover
of
the
old
days
because
of
the
ardor
that
animated
you
and
your
smile
and
your
amiability
and
the
light
that
shone
in
your
eyes
and
you
showed
me
the
scratches
on
your
hands
then
i
felt
a
sudden
impulse
to
take
those
hands
to
kiss
them
where
did
i
get
the
strength
to
restrain
myself
did
not
feel
myself
and
i
saw
in
a
flash
all
the
happiness
that
you
offered
me
with
the
flowering
thorns
all
the
happiness
that
i
must
renounce
forever
ah
tullio
my
heart
is
proof
against
all
trials
since
it
can
be
so
crushed
without
breaking
i
die
hard
she
pronounced
this
last
phrase
in
a
deeper
tone
with
an
indefinable
accent
of
irony
mingled
with
anger
i
dared
not
raise
my
face
to
look
at
her
her
words
caused
me
atrocious
suffering
and
yet
i
trembled
every
time
she
stopped
i
feared
that
her
strength
would
suddenly
abandon
her
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
her
to
continue
and
i
awaited
from
her
mouth
other
confessions
other
fragments
of
soul
it
was
a
great
great
mistake
she
continued
not
to
have
died
before
you
returned
from
venice
but
poor
maria
poor
natalia
could
i
abandon
them
she
hesitated
an
instant
nor
you
either
i
could
not
leave
you
in
such
a
manner
i
might
have
caused
you
remorse
you
would
have
been
the
object
of
everybody
s
accusations
we
could
not
have
dissimulated
with
our
mother
she
would
have
asked
you
why
should
juliana
have
wished
to
die
she
would
have
come
to
know
the
truth
which
we
have
kept
from
her
till
saintly
woman
emotion
choked
her
utterance
her
voice
became
hoarse
began
to
tremble
tearfully
i
felt
a
lump
rise
in
my
throat
too
i
thought
of
all
that
and
when
you
wished
to
bring
me
here
i
thought
too
that
i
was
no
longer
worthy
of
her
that
i
was
no
longer
worthy
to
receive
her
kisses
on
my
forehead
and
be
called
her
daughter
but
you
know
how
weak
we
are
how
easily
we
give
way
to
the
force
of
circumstances
i
had
no
more
hope
i
knew
that
outside
of
death
there
remained
no
other
refuge
for
me
i
knew
that
every
day
the
circle
was
closing
in
more
and
yet
i
permitted
the
days
to
pass
one
by
one
without
taking
any
resolution
yet
i
had
a
sure
means
of
death
she
stopped
obeying
a
sudden
impulse
i
raised
my
eyes
and
looked
at
her
fixedly
she
shuddered
violently
and
the
pain
which
my
look
caused
her
was
so
apparent
that
i
lowered
my
forehead
and
resumed
my
first
attitude
up
to
now
she
had
been
standing
she
sat
down
an
interval
of
silence
followed
do
you
believe
she
asked
me
with
a
timid
and
unhappy
air
do
you
believe
that
the
sin
is
great
when
the
soul
did
not
consent
that
allusion
to
the
sufficed
to
stir
up
in
me
instantly
the
dregs
that
had
settled
and
a
sort
of
bitter
acridity
rose
to
my
mouth
an
involuntary
sarcasm
left
my
lips
i
said
affecting
a
smile
poor
soul
that
expression
caused
a
look
of
such
intense
pain
to
appear
on
juliana
s
face
that
i
felt
immediately
the
acute
sting
of
repentance
i
understood
that
it
were
impossible
for
me
to
have
inflicted
a
more
cruel
blow
and
that
at
that
moment
and
against
such
a
poor
submissive
creature
irony
was
the
worst
of
cowardices
forgive
me
she
said
she
had
the
appearance
of
a
woman
smitten
by
death
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
her
look
had
precisely
the
sad
gentleness
almost
infantile
that
i
had
already
seen
on
the
wounded
when
they
are
placed
on
their
biers
forgive
me
yesterday
you
too
spoke
of
the
soul
you
think
now
say
those
things
to
obtain
but
i
do
not
seek
to
exculpate
myself
i
know
that
pardon
is
impossible
and
that
it
is
impossible
to
forget
i
know
there
is
no
hope
you
understand
me
i
only
seek
to
excuse
myself
for
having
received
your
mother
s
kisses
she
still
spoke
in
a
low
tone
very
weak
and
yet
like
a
sharp
and
reiterated
cry
i
felt
on
my
brow
so
heavy
a
weight
of
sorrows
that
not
for
myself
tullio
but
for
my
pain
only
for
my
pain
i
let
your
mother
kiss
me
then
i
was
unworthy
of
them
but
my
pain
deserved
them
you
can
forgive
me
i
felt
an
impulse
of
kindness
of
pity
but
i
did
not
yield
to
it
my
eyes
avoided
hers
and
i
made
enormous
efforts
not
to
writhe
in
convulsive
spasms
not
to
yield
to
extravagant
actions
certain
days
i
deferred
from
hour
to
hour
the
execution
of
my
project
the
thought
of
this
house
of
what
would
afterwards
happen
in
this
house
took
away
my
courage
see
how
i
have
ended
by
losing
even
the
hope
of
being
able
to
hide
the
truth
from
you
of
being
able
to
spare
you
for
from
the
first
days
your
mother
guessed
my
condition
do
you
remember
the
day
when
i
was
at
the
window
and
when
the
odor
of
the
violets
nauseated
me
it
was
then
that
your
mother
noticed
it
imagine
my
terror
i
thought
if
i
kill
myself
he
will
learn
the
secret
from
his
mother
and
who
knows
how
far
the
consequences
of
the
sin
i
have
committed
will
reach
night
and
day
i
racked
my
soul
to
find
a
means
of
sparing
you
on
sunday
when
you
asked
me
shall
we
go
to
the
lilacs
on
tuesday
i
consented
without
reflecting
i
abandoned
myself
to
destiny
i
trusted
to
chance
i
was
certain
that
that
day
would
be
my
last
and
this
certitude
exalted
me
inspired
me
with
a
sort
of
dementia
but
tullio
remember
your
words
of
yesterday
and
tell
me
if
now
you
appreciate
my
martyrdom
do
you
appreciate
it
she
bent
toward
me
as
if
to
project
her
painful
question
into
my
soul
and
she
entwined
her
fingers
convulsively
you
had
never
spoken
to
me
like
that
before
you
had
never
spoken
in
such
a
voice
when
on
the
bench
you
asked
me
is
too
late
perhaps
i
looked
at
you
and
your
face
frightened
me
could
i
reply
it
is
too
late
could
i
have
broken
your
heart
at
one
blow
what
would
have
become
of
us
then
i
determined
to
yield
to
one
last
intoxication
and
i
saw
nothing
more
but
my
death
and
my
passion
her
voice
had
become
strangely
hoarse
i
looked
at
her
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
no
longer
recognized
her
so
transfigured
was
she
a
convulsion
contracted
every
line
of
her
face
her
lower
lip
trembled
violently
her
eyes
burned
with
febrile
ardor
do
you
blame
me
she
asked
in
a
hoarse
distressed
tone
do
you
despise
me
for
what
i
did
yesterday
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
then
after
a
pause
she
shook
off
her
weakness
with
a
resolute
gesture
her
voice
became
stronger
destiny
has
willed
that
i
should
live
until
now
destiny
has
willed
that
you
should
learn
the
truth
from
your
mother
from
your
mother
yesterday
evening
when
you
came
into
this
room
you
knew
all
and
you
said
nothing
and
before
your
mother
you
kissed
the
cheek
i
offered
you
before
i
die
permit
me
to
kiss
your
hands
it
is
the
only
favor
i
implore
of
you
now
i
await
your
commands
i
am
ready
for
anything
speak
i
said
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
live
impossible
tullio
she
cried
impossible
have
you
thought
of
what
will
happen
if
i
live
i
have
thought
of
it
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
live
what
horror
and
she
started
instinctive
gesture
of
fright
listen
tullio
henceforth
you
know
everything
henceforth
suicide
can
no
longer
serve
me
to
hide
my
shame
from
you
nor
keep
me
from
appearing
before
you
you
know
all
and
here
we
are
together
and
we
can
still
look
at
one
another
we
can
still
speak
to
one
another
the
question
is
an
entirely
different
one
i
no
longer
seek
to
elude
your
vigilance
in
order
to
kill
myself
on
the
contrary
i
wish
you
to
help
me
in
disappearing
in
the
most
natural
way
possible
without
awakening
any
suspicion
around
us
i
have
two
and
corrosive
sublimate
but
perhaps
poisons
are
useless
it
is
difficult
to
conceal
poisoning
and
it
is
necessary
that
my
death
should
seem
to
be
involuntary
caused
by
accident
by
a
mishap
you
understand
it
is
the
only
way
out
of
it
the
secret
will
remain
between
us
two
she
began
to
speak
rapidly
firmly
and
deliberately
as
if
she
argued
in
order
to
persuade
me
to
consent
to
some
desirable
compact
and
not
to
a
compact
of
complicity
in
the
execution
of
an
extravagant
project
i
let
her
go
on
a
sort
of
singular
fascination
rooted
me
to
the
me
to
look
at
and
listen
to
the
fragile
and
pale
creature
possessed
by
such
impetuous
waves
of
moral
energy
listen
tullio
i
have
an
idea
federico
told
me
of
your
insane
ride
of
the
danger
that
you
incurred
on
the
bank
of
the
assoro
he
told
me
everything
i
thought
trembling
who
knows
what
mental
torture
made
him
incur
such
peril
then
as
i
thought
of
it
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
understood
it
was
like
a
prophetic
revelation
my
soul
seemed
to
see
a
vision
of
all
the
pain
that
awaited
you
pain
against
which
nothing
could
guard
you
pain
that
would
grow
day
by
day
inconsolable
intolerable
ah
tullio
it
is
certain
that
you
have
already
felt
this
pain
and
that
you
also
foresee
your
powerlessness
to
bear
it
there
is
but
one
means
of
salvation
for
you
for
me
for
our
souls
for
our
love
yes
let
me
say
love
let
me
still
believe
in
your
words
of
yesterday
let
me
repeat
that
i
love
you
now
as
i
have
never
loved
you
before
and
it
is
precisely
for
that
precisely
because
we
love
each
other
that
i
must
disappear
from
the
world
that
you
must
no
longer
see
me
an
extraordinary
moral
elevation
heightened
her
voice
and
entire
person
a
great
thrill
passed
through
me
a
fugitive
illusion
seized
upon
my
mind
for
a
moment
i
really
believed
that
my
love
and
that
of
this
woman
were
on
an
equal
plane
of
the
same
ideal
measureless
height
freed
from
human
misery
freed
from
all
sin
irreproachable
i
felt
for
several
moments
the
same
sensation
that
i
had
felt
at
the
beginning
when
the
actual
world
had
seemed
to
me
to
have
completely
vanished
then
as
always
the
inevitable
phenomena
occurred
this
state
of
consciousness
ceased
to
be
mine
it
became
objective
became
a
stranger
to
me
listen
she
went
on
lowering
her
voice
as
if
she
feared
to
be
overheard
i
have
told
federico
that
i
have
a
great
desire
to
revisit
the
woods
the
the
entire
country
morning
federico
will
not
have
the
leisure
to
accompany
us
because
he
must
return
to
casal
caldore
we
two
will
go
alone
federico
has
told
me
that
i
can
ride
favilla
when
we
are
on
the
will
do
what
you
did
this
morning
an
accident
will
happen
federico
told
me
it
is
impossible
to
be
rescued
from
the
assoro
will
you
although
her
speech
was
connected
she
seemed
a
prey
to
a
kind
of
delirium
an
unaccustomed
flush
tinged
her
cheeks
her
eyes
had
an
extraordinary
lustre
the
vision
of
the
sinister
river
flashed
rapidly
through
my
mind
she
repeated
bending
toward
me
will
you
i
arose
and
took
her
hands
i
wished
to
calm
her
fever
immense
pity
oppressed
me
my
voice
was
gentle
grew
kind
trembled
with
affectionate
emotion
poor
juliana
do
not
torment
yourself
thus
you
are
suffering
too
much
your
grief
has
deprived
you
of
your
reason
poor
soul
you
must
be
brave
you
must
not
think
of
the
things
you
have
just
said
think
of
maria
of
natalia
as
for
me
i
have
accepted
the
punishment
it
is
a
punishment
that
i
have
well
deserved
for
all
the
wrongs
that
i
have
done
you
i
accept
it
i
will
bear
it
but
you
must
live
promise
me
juliana
in
the
name
of
maria
in
the
name
of
natalia
in
the
name
of
the
tenderness
that
you
bear
for
my
mother
in
the
name
of
all
that
i
told
you
at
the
lilacs
promise
me
that
you
will
in
no
way
seek
to
kill
yourself
she
kept
her
head
down
then
all
at
once
freeing
her
hands
she
seized
mine
and
began
to
kiss
them
furiously
and
i
felt
on
my
skin
the
warmth
of
her
mouth
the
warmth
of
her
tears
and
as
i
attempted
to
disengage
myself
she
fell
from
her
seat
on
her
knees
without
freeing
my
hands
sobbing
showing
me
an
agonized
face
over
which
the
tears
rolled
in
streams
in
which
the
contraction
of
the
mouth
revealed
the
inexpressible
spasm
that
convulsed
her
entire
being
and
i
incapable
of
raising
her
incapable
of
uttering
a
word
suffocated
by
a
cruel
attack
of
anguish
overcome
by
the
violence
of
the
spasm
that
contracted
that
poor
pallid
mouth
forgetful
of
all
rancor
of
every
pride
without
any
other
sensation
than
that
of
the
blind
terror
of
life
without
seeing
in
myself
and
in
this
crushed
woman
anything
else
than
human
suffering
the
eternal
human
suffering
the
disaster
of
inevitable
infractions
the
weight
of
brute
flesh
the
horror
of
pitiless
fatalities
that
attach
themselves
to
the
very
roots
of
our
being
and
the
infinite
physical
sorrow
of
our
love
i
fell
also
on
my
knees
before
her
by
an
instinctive
desire
to
prostrate
myself
to
take
the
same
humble
attitude
as
this
creature
who
suffered
and
who
made
me
suffer
and
i
burst
into
sobs
and
once
more
after
so
long
a
time
our
tears
mingled
burning
tears
alas
but
powerless
to
change
our
destiny
who
will
ever
be
able
to
describe
in
words
the
sensation
of
stupor
and
of
desolate
aridity
which
in
man
succeeds
tears
uselessly
shed
paroxysms
of
useless
hopelessness
tears
are
a
temporary
phenomenon
each
crisis
ends
in
calm
every
attack
is
brief
and
afterwards
man
finds
himself
exhausted
his
heart
arid
more
than
ever
convinced
of
his
own
impotence
corporeally
stupid
and
sad
with
the
impassable
reality
before
him
i
was
the
first
to
cease
weeping
i
was
the
first
to
open
my
eyes
to
the
light
i
was
the
first
to
notice
my
posture
and
juliana
s
and
of
the
surrounding
objects
we
were
still
on
our
knees
one
facing
the
other
on
the
carpet
a
few
sobs
still
shook
her
the
candle
was
burning
on
the
table
and
every
now
and
then
its
tiny
flame
flickered
and
bent
as
if
under
the
breath
of
a
breeze
in
the
silence
my
ear
perceived
the
slight
sound
of
a
watch
which
was
somewhere
in
the
room
life
rolled
on
time
passed
my
soul
was
empty
and
solitary
after
the
violence
of
the
emotion
had
subsided
after
the
intoxication
of
the
pain
had
become
dissipated
our
attitudes
signified
nothing
any
more
had
no
longer
a
d
i
must
rise
raise
up
juliana
say
something
definitely
close
this
scene
but
i
felt
for
all
this
a
strange
repugnance
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
become
incapable
of
the
slightest
physical
or
moral
effort
i
was
vexed
at
being
there
at
having
to
submit
to
these
necessities
at
meeting
with
these
difficulties
at
not
having
the
strength
to
leave
my
position
and
a
sort
of
deep
rancor
against
juliana
began
to
stir
confusedly
in
the
depths
of
my
being
i
arose
i
assisted
her
to
arise
each
of
the
sobs
that
from
time
to
time
still
shook
her
increased
in
me
this
inexplicable
rancor
it
is
then
quite
true
that
certain
germs
of
hate
are
dissimulated
at
the
bottom
of
every
sentiment
which
unites
two
human
creatures
that
is
to
say
which
connects
two
egoisms
it
is
then
quite
true
that
these
germs
of
inevitable
hate
disturb
our
most
affectionate
moments
our
best
impulses
all
there
is
beautiful
in
the
soul
bears
in
itself
a
latent
germ
of
corruption
is
condemned
to
become
corrupted
i
said
and
i
feared
that
involuntarily
the
tone
of
my
voice
was
not
sufficiently
gentle
be
calm
juliana
the
moment
has
come
to
be
courageous
come
sit
down
be
calm
will
you
have
a
drink
of
water
will
you
smell
some
salts
answer
yes
give
me
a
little
water
you
will
find
it
in
the
alcove
on
the
night
table
her
voice
was
still
tearful
and
she
dried
her
face
with
a
handkerchief
seated
on
a
low
divan
facing
the
large
mirror
of
a
closet
she
had
not
ceased
sobbing
convulsively
i
entered
the
alcove
to
get
the
glass
i
perceived
the
bed
in
the
shadow
it
was
already
made
a
corner
of
the
covers
was
raised
and
thrown
back
a
long
white
was
laid
close
to
the
pillow
immediately
my
subtle
and
keen
sense
of
smell
detected
the
slight
perfume
of
the
batiste
a
faint
odor
of
orris
and
violet
so
familiar
to
me
the
sight
of
the
bed
the
odor
of
the
familiar
perfume
disturbed
me
deeply
i
hastened
to
pour
out
the
water
and
i
left
the
alcove
to
take
the
glass
to
juliana
who
was
waiting
she
swallowed
a
few
mouthfuls
a
little
at
a
time
while
i
standing
before
her
attentively
observed
the
movement
of
her
mouth
thank
you
tullio
she
said
she
gave
me
back
the
glass
still
half
full
as
i
was
thirsty
i
drank
the
water
which
remained
that
mechanical
action
sufficed
to
increase
my
agitation
i
sat
down
in
my
turn
on
the
divan
and
we
remained
silent
both
absorbed
in
our
reflections
separated
only
by
a
short
distance
the
divan
with
our
figures
was
reflected
in
the
mirror
of
the
closet
we
could
see
each
other
s
faces
without
looking
at
one
another
but
rather
confusedly
because
the
light
was
feeble
and
vacillating
on
the
vague
surface
of
the
glass
i
intently
examined
juliana
s
silhouette
which
in
its
immobility
gradually
acquired
a
mysterious
aspect
the
disquieting
fascination
of
certain
women
s
portraits
obscured
by
time
the
intensity
of
fictitious
life
possessed
by
beings
born
of
a
hallucination
and
gradually
this
distant
image
seemed
to
me
more
living
than
the
real
person
gradually
i
saw
in
that
image
the
caressing
wife
the
voluptuous
woman
the
mistress
the
unfaithful
one
i
closed
my
eyes
the
other
rose
up
before
me
one
of
my
usual
visions
appeared
i
thought
up
to
now
she
has
made
no
direct
allusion
to
her
fall
to
the
circumstances
of
her
fall
she
has
uttered
only
one
significant
phrase
do
you
think
the
sin
is
grave
the
soul
has
not
consented
and
what
did
that
mean
it
was
only
one
of
those
subtle
distinctions
to
which
one
has
usually
recourse
to
excuse
and
extenuate
one
s
treason
and
infamy
i
suffered
a
nameless
torture
the
furious
desire
to
know
all
racked
my
soul
the
material
visions
exasperated
me
the
other
since
the
instant
in
which
he
had
risen
in
my
thoughts
had
not
ceased
for
a
moment
to
beset
my
mind
was
it
filippo
arborio
had
i
guessed
correctly
suddenly
i
turned
toward
juliana
she
looked
at
me
but
the
question
choked
in
my
throat
i
lowered
my
eyes
bent
my
head
and
with
the
same
spasmodic
resistance
that
i
should
have
felt
on
plucking
a
fragment
of
my
flesh
from
some
part
of
my
body
i
dared
to
ask
her
the
name
of
man
my
voice
trembling
and
hoarse
frightened
even
myself
at
this
unexpected
demand
juliana
started
but
remained
silent
you
do
not
answer
i
insisted
forcing
myself
to
repress
the
anger
that
was
on
the
point
of
invading
me
that
blind
anger
which
on
the
previous
night
already
had
passed
over
my
mind
like
a
whirlwind
ah
my
god
she
moaned
despairingly
and
she
sank
down
in
a
heap
on
the
divan
burying
her
face
in
the
cushion
my
god
my
god
but
i
wished
to
know
i
wished
at
any
cost
to
tear
the
avowal
from
her
do
you
remember
i
went
on
do
you
remember
that
morning
when
i
entered
your
room
unexpectedly
early
in
november
do
you
remember
i
entered
without
knowing
why
perhaps
because
i
heard
you
singing
you
were
singing
the
air
from
orphée
you
were
preparing
to
go
out
do
you
remember
i
saw
a
book
on
your
i
opened
it
i
read
on
the
a
dedication
it
was
a
novel
do
you
remember
she
remained
with
her
face
buried
in
the
cushion
and
made
no
reply
i
stooped
over
her
i
trembled
with
a
chill
like
that
which
precedes
a
fever
i
added
it
is
perhaps
he
she
did
not
answer
but
she
raised
her
head
with
a
motion
of
despair
she
seemed
distracted
she
made
a
gesture
as
if
about
to
throw
herself
on
me
then
stopped
crying
have
pity
have
pity
let
me
die
what
you
are
making
me
suffer
is
worse
than
a
thousand
deaths
i
have
borne
everything
i
am
capable
of
bearing
everything
but
not
that
no
i
can
not
i
can
not
if
i
live
it
will
mean
for
us
both
a
constant
martyrdom
that
will
daily
become
more
terrible
and
you
will
begin
to
hate
me
all
your
hate
will
be
vented
on
me
i
am
sure
of
it
sure
i
have
already
felt
the
hate
in
your
voice
have
pity
let
me
die
she
seemed
distracted
she
had
a
furious
desire
to
seize
hold
of
me
but
not
daring
she
twisted
her
hands
in
an
effort
to
control
herself
her
whole
body
convulsed
i
seized
her
by
the
arms
and
drew
her
toward
me
so
i
am
to
know
nothing
i
said
to
her
speaking
almost
on
her
mouth
now
distracted
myself
carried
away
by
a
cruel
instinct
that
made
my
hands
rough
i
love
you
i
have
always
loved
you
i
have
always
been
yours
i
expiate
by
this
hell
a
moment
s
you
understand
moment
s
that
is
the
truth
can
not
you
feel
that
it
is
the
truth
once
more
overwhelmed
by
the
weight
of
our
misfortune
i
clasped
the
poor
trembling
creature
to
my
heart
and
silently
kissed
away
her
scalding
tears
the
external
indications
of
juliana
s
condition
were
not
yet
visible
the
tie
that
bound
the
infant
to
the
mother
must
be
very
frail
how
was
it
that
the
violent
emotions
of
the
day
at
the
lilacs
and
of
the
following
night
had
not
sufficed
to
provoke
a
liberating
crisis
everything
was
against
me
everything
conspired
against
me
and
my
hate
became
more
savage
to
prevent
the
birth
of
the
child
such
was
my
secret
design
and
i
considered
the
future
with
a
sort
of
divining
juliana
would
give
birth
to
a
boy
sole
heir
of
our
ancient
name
the
son
who
was
not
mine
would
grow
up
without
accident
he
would
usurp
the
love
of
my
mother
and
my
brother
he
would
be
caressed
adored
he
would
be
preferred
to
maria
and
to
natalia
my
own
creations
the
force
of
habit
would
dull
juliana
s
remorse
she
would
abandon
herself
without
restraint
to
her
maternal
feeling
and
the
son
who
was
not
mine
would
grow
up
under
her
protection
surrounded
by
her
assiduous
cares
he
would
become
robust
and
handsome
he
would
become
capricious
like
a
little
despot
he
would
reign
in
my
house
by
degrees
these
visions
became
particularized
such
or
such
an
imaginary
spectacle
took
the
shape
and
motion
of
an
actual
scene
such
or
such
a
trait
of
that
imaginary
life
was
impressed
so
strongly
in
my
consciousness
that
it
retained
there
for
some
time
the
characteristics
of
an
effective
reality
the
child
s
traits
were
modified
to
infinity
his
acts
his
gestures
were
diversified
without
cease
at
times
i
represented
him
to
myself
as
being
thin
pale
taciturn
with
a
large
heavy
head
bent
on
his
chest
at
other
times
i
saw
him
all
rosy
plump
gay
chattering
graceful
and
coaxing
particularly
affectionate
toward
me
very
good
at
other
times
on
the
contrary
he
was
nervous
bilious
a
little
spiteful
full
of
intelligence
and
evil
instincts
rough
with
his
sisters
cruel
to
animals
incapable
of
tenderness
undisciplinable
this
last
image
ended
by
dominating
all
the
others
eliminated
them
by
becoming
more
lasting
fixed
itself
into
a
precise
type
became
animated
with
an
intense
chimerical
life
ended
by
taking
a
name
the
name
that
i
had
long
since
chosen
for
the
male
heir
my
father
s
name
raymond
that
little
perverse
phantom
was
a
direct
emanation
of
my
hate
and
he
bore
against
me
a
hostility
equal
to
that
i
had
for
him
he
was
an
enemy
an
adversary
with
whom
i
was
about
to
begin
a
struggle
he
was
my
victim
and
i
was
his
i
could
not
escape
from
him
he
could
not
escape
from
me
we
were
both
shut
in
as
it
were
in
a
circle
of
iron
he
had
gray
eyes
like
filippo
arborio
among
the
various
expressions
of
his
face
one
struck
me
above
all
in
an
imaginary
scene
that
often
arose
before
me
this
scene
is
as
follows
i
entered
a
room
filled
with
darkness
with
strange
silence
i
thought
i
was
alone
there
all
at
once
on
turning
round
i
perceived
raymond
looking
at
me
fixedly
with
his
gray
and
wicked
eyes
suddenly
the
temptation
to
commit
the
crime
assailed
me
so
strongly
that
so
as
not
to
throw
myself
on
the
malefic
being
i
took
to
flight
between
juliana
and
me
the
compact
appeared
concluded
she
lived
we
both
continued
to
live
simulating
and
dissimulating
like
dipsomaniacs
we
had
two
alternate
lives
the
one
tranquil
made
up
entirely
of
gentle
appearances
of
filial
tendernesses
pure
affection
reciprocal
complaisances
the
other
agitated
feverish
troubled
uncertain
hopeless
a
prey
to
a
fixed
idea
forever
pursued
by
a
menace
precipitated
toward
an
unknown
catastrophe
there
were
rare
moments
when
my
soul
seeking
to
avoid
so
much
misery
to
free
itself
from
the
curse
that
enveloped
it
like
a
thousand
tentacles
burst
forth
with
an
aspiration
toward
the
highest
ideal
of
goodness
a
glimpse
of
which
i
had
more
than
once
had
my
memory
recalled
to
me
the
singular
words
of
my
brother
at
the
entrance
to
assoro
forest
on
the
subject
of
giovanni
di
scordio
will
do
well
tullio
not
to
forget
that
and
that
smile
on
the
old
man
s
withered
mouth
acquired
a
profound
significance
became
extraordinarily
luminous
exalted
me
like
the
revelation
of
a
supreme
verity
almost
always
during
these
rare
moments
i
also
saw
another
smile
that
of
juliana
lying
ill
on
her
pillows
that
unexpected
smile
which
decreased
decreased
without
disappearing
and
the
remembrance
of
the
distant
peaceful
afternoon
when
i
had
intoxicated
the
poor
invalid
with
deceptive
transports
the
recollection
of
the
morning
when
she
rose
for
the
first
time
and
when
in
the
middle
of
the
room
she
had
fallen
into
my
arms
laughing
and
panting
the
recollection
of
the
truly
divine
gesture
with
which
she
had
offered
me
love
indulgence
peace
dreams
forgetfulness
all
that
there
is
beautiful
and
all
that
there
is
good
caused
me
hopeless
regrets
and
infinite
remorse
the
sweet
and
terrible
question
that
andré
bolkonsky
had
read
on
the
dead
face
of
the
princess
lisa
i
read
unceasingly
on
the
still
living
face
of
juliana
what
have
you
done
to
me
no
reproach
had
issued
from
her
lips
she
had
not
attempted
to
lessen
the
gravity
of
her
sin
to
interpose
any
one
of
my
own
infamies
she
had
been
humble
before
her
executioner
not
a
drop
of
bitterness
had
tinged
her
words
and
yet
her
eyes
repeated
to
me
what
have
you
done
to
me
a
strange
sacrificial
ardor
suddenly
fired
me
impelled
me
to
take
up
my
cross
the
grandeur
of
the
expiation
seemed
worthy
of
my
courage
i
felt
in
myself
a
superabundance
of
strength
a
heroic
soul
an
inspired
intelligence
on
going
toward
the
sorrowful
sister
i
thought
i
will
find
the
kind
words
that
will
console
her
i
will
find
the
fraternal
tones
that
will
alleviate
her
pain
that
will
clear
her
brow
but
directly
i
entered
her
presence
i
could
no
longer
speak
my
lips
seemed
sealed
with
an
infrangible
seal
all
my
being
seemed
stricken
by
a
malefice
the
internal
light
suddenly
died
out
as
if
extinguished
by
an
icy
wind
of
unknown
origin
and
in
the
shadows
began
to
move
vaguely
that
dull
rancor
which
i
had
so
often
felt
and
which
i
was
powerless
to
repress
it
was
the
symptom
of
an
attack
i
stammered
a
few
incoherent
words
i
avoided
juliana
s
eyes
and
i
fled
from
the
room
it
is
unbelievable
how
much
energy
she
displayed
in
dissimulating
before
those
who
were
ignorant
of
the
facts
she
still
succeeded
in
smiling
my
known
anxiety
for
her
health
furnished
me
with
a
pretext
that
justified
a
certain
sadness
that
i
could
not
succeed
in
disguising
this
anxiety
shared
by
my
mother
and
by
my
brother
resulted
in
the
coming
event
not
being
looked
upon
as
cause
for
rejoicing
as
the
previous
births
had
been
and
everyone
avoided
making
the
usual
allusions
or
predictions
i
was
grateful
for
that
finally
vebesti
arrived
at
the
badiola
his
visit
reassured
us
he
said
juliana
was
very
much
run
down
he
noticed
in
her
a
slight
nervous
irritability
an
impoverishment
of
the
blood
a
general
disturbance
of
the
nutritive
functions
but
he
affirmed
that
the
progress
of
the
gestation
presented
no
notable
anomaly
and
that
when
the
general
condition
was
improved
delivery
could
take
place
under
normal
conditions
besides
he
gave
us
to
understand
that
he
placed
considerable
confidence
in
juliana
s
exceptional
temperament
whose
extraordinary
power
of
resistance
he
had
had
occasion
to
test
in
the
past
he
prescribed
careful
hygiene
and
a
reconstructive
diet
approved
of
the
stay
at
the
badiola
recommended
regularity
moderate
exercise
and
tranquillity
of
mind
i
count
particularly
on
you
he
said
to
me
seriously
it
was
a
disappointment
to
me
i
had
placed
in
him
a
hope
of
salvation
and
lo
i
had
lost
it
before
his
arrival
i
nourished
this
hope
if
he
would
only
declare
it
necessary
in
order
to
preserve
the
mother
to
sacrifice
the
still
formless
child
if
he
would
only
declare
it
necessary
in
order
to
avoid
a
certain
catastrophe
at
the
completion
of
the
term
to
have
recourse
to
extreme
measures
and
suppress
the
child
juliana
would
be
saved
she
would
get
well
and
i
too
would
be
saved
i
should
feel
as
if
reborn
it
would
be
possible
i
believe
to
almost
forget
or
at
least
to
be
resigned
time
heals
so
many
wounds
and
work
consoles
so
many
sorrows
i
could
i
believe
gradually
recover
my
peace
and
turn
over
a
new
leaf
follow
my
brother
s
example
become
better
become
a
man
live
for
others
embrace
the
new
religion
i
believe
that
my
very
sorrow
could
help
me
in
regaining
my
dignity
the
man
to
whom
it
is
given
to
suffer
more
than
others
is
also
of
suffering
more
than
others
is
not
that
a
verse
from
my
brother
s
evangel
there
is
then
an
election
for
pain
giovanni
di
scordio
for
instance
is
one
of
the
elect
to
possess
such
a
smile
is
to
possess
a
divine
gift
i
could
i
believe
merit
that
gift
such
had
been
my
hope
by
a
curious
contradiction
i
had
hoped
by
my
expiatory
fervor
to
obtain
a
diminution
of
my
punishment
in
fact
though
i
wished
to
be
regenerated
by
my
suffering
i
was
afraid
to
suffer
i
had
an
atrocious
fear
of
facing
actual
pain
my
soul
was
already
exhausted
although
it
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
true
road
and
had
been
agitated
by
christian
aspirations
it
stole
away
by
an
oblique
path
that
led
straight
to
the
inevitable
abyss
while
speaking
with
the
doctor
when
showing
a
slight
incredulity
at
his
reassuring
predictions
by
manifesting
anxiety
i
found
the
means
of
conveying
my
thoughts
to
him
i
made
him
understand
that
i
desired
him
at
any
cost
to
free
juliana
from
all
danger
and
that
if
it
were
necessary
i
would
renounce
this
new
offspring
without
regret
i
begged
him
to
speak
to
me
frankly
he
reassured
me
a
second
time
he
declared
to
me
that
even
in
a
hopeless
case
he
would
not
have
recourse
to
extremes
because
in
the
state
that
juliana
was
in
a
hemorrhage
would
be
very
dangerous
he
repeated
again
that
above
all
we
must
aid
and
stimulate
the
regeneration
of
the
blood
reconstitute
the
debilitated
organism
contrive
by
every
means
in
our
power
that
the
mother
should
arrive
at
the
natural
term
of
gestation
with
her
strength
restored
with
a
confident
and
tranquil
mind
he
concluded
i
believe
that
your
wife
requires
moral
consolation
more
than
anything
else
i
am
an
old
friend
i
know
that
she
has
suffered
much
it
depends
on
you
to
pacify
her
mind
my
mother
redoubled
her
tenderness
for
juliana
she
let
her
know
her
cherished
dream
and
her
presentiment
it
was
a
grandson
whom
she
awaited
a
little
raymond
she
was
sure
this
time
my
brother
too
expected
raymond
maria
and
natalia
often
asked
their
mother
and
grandmother
and
me
artless
questions
concerning
their
future
companion
thus
the
domestic
love
expressed
by
presages
wishes
and
hopes
began
to
surround
the
invisible
fruit
the
being
that
was
yet
without
form
one
day
we
were
seated
juliana
and
i
beneath
the
elms
my
mother
had
just
left
us
during
her
affectionate
chat
she
had
named
raymond
she
had
even
brought
again
into
use
a
pet
name
that
called
up
distant
memories
of
my
dead
father
juliana
and
i
answered
her
by
a
smile
she
believed
that
we
shared
her
dream
and
she
had
left
in
order
that
we
might
go
on
dreaming
undisturbed
it
was
the
calm
and
limpid
hour
that
follows
the
sunset
above
our
heads
the
foliage
was
motionless
from
time
to
time
a
flock
of
swallows
rapidly
cleft
the
air
with
a
sound
of
beating
wings
with
piercing
cries
as
at
the
lilacs
our
eyes
followed
the
sainted
woman
as
long
as
she
was
visible
then
we
looked
at
one
another
silently
in
consternation
we
remained
for
several
minutes
without
breaking
the
silence
crushed
by
the
immensity
of
our
sorrow
and
then
with
a
terrible
effort
of
my
entire
being
making
an
abstraction
of
juliana
i
felt
the
little
creature
living
alone
at
my
side
as
if
at
that
moment
no
other
creature
existed
near
me
had
existed
around
me
and
it
was
not
an
illusory
sensation
but
a
real
and
profound
sensation
a
thrill
of
horror
ran
through
all
my
fibres
i
started
violently
and
fixed
my
eyes
on
my
companion
s
face
in
order
to
dissipate
the
sensation
we
looked
at
one
another
without
knowing
what
to
say
or
do
to
combat
the
excess
of
our
anguish
i
saw
in
her
face
the
reflection
of
my
distress
i
divined
my
own
physiognomy
my
eyes
turned
instinctively
toward
her
body
and
i
perceived
on
her
face
the
same
expression
of
terror
exhibited
by
invalids
afflicted
by
a
monstrous
infirmity
when
one
looks
at
the
member
deformed
by
an
incurable
malady
after
a
pause
during
which
we
both
tried
in
vain
to
measure
our
suffering
she
said
in
a
low
voice
have
you
thought
that
this
may
endure
as
long
as
we
live
my
lips
remained
closed
it
was
only
within
myself
that
was
heard
the
determined
answer
no
it
will
not
last
she
went
on
remember
that
with
a
single
word
you
can
solve
the
difficulty
and
free
yourself
i
am
ready
remember
i
still
remained
silent
but
i
thought
no
it
is
not
you
who
must
die
she
went
on
in
a
voice
that
tearful
tenderness
rendered
trembling
i
can
not
console
you
there
is
consolation
neither
for
you
nor
for
me
there
will
never
be
any
have
you
thought
that
someone
will
always
be
between
us
if
your
mother
s
wish
is
think
think
but
my
soul
shuddered
beneath
the
sinister
light
of
a
single
idea
i
said
they
all
love
him
already
i
hesitated
i
gave
juliana
a
rapid
look
then
suddenly
lowering
my
eyes
bending
my
head
i
asked
in
a
voice
that
died
away
on
my
lips
and
you
do
you
love
him
oh
what
a
question
i
could
not
restrain
myself
from
persisting
although
i
suffered
physically
as
if
an
open
wound
were
being
torn
by
nails
do
you
love
him
no
no
i
have
a
horror
of
him
i
felt
an
instinctive
joy
as
if
i
had
obtained
by
this
confession
an
assent
to
my
secret
idea
and
a
sort
of
complicity
but
had
juliana
answered
me
sincerely
or
had
she
told
a
falsehood
out
of
pity
for
me
i
was
assailed
by
a
cruel
and
furious
desire
to
persist
to
make
her
confess
fully
to
penetrate
to
the
very
depths
of
her
soul
but
her
appearance
stopped
me
i
abstained
i
now
felt
no
bitterness
toward
her
i
was
now
drawn
toward
her
by
an
emotion
of
gratitude
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
horror
she
had
shudderingly
confessed
separated
her
from
the
creature
whom
she
was
nourishing
and
brought
her
closer
to
me
i
felt
a
desire
to
make
her
understand
these
things
and
increase
her
aversion
to
the
infant
to
be
born
as
if
against
an
irreconcilable
enemy
of
us
both
i
took
her
hand
i
said
to
her
you
have
comforted
me
a
little
i
thank
you
you
and
i
added
masking
my
homicidal
intention
by
a
christian
hope
there
is
a
providence
who
knows
the
day
of
deliverance
will
come
perhaps
you
understand
me
who
knows
pray
to
god
it
was
a
presage
of
death
for
the
infant
to
be
born
it
was
a
wish
and
by
inducing
juliana
to
pray
that
it
should
come
to
pass
i
was
preparing
her
for
the
funereal
event
i
obtained
from
her
a
sort
of
moral
complicity
i
ended
by
thinking
if
as
a
result
of
my
words
the
suggestion
of
crime
should
come
to
her
and
gradually
become
strong
enough
to
actuate
her
certainly
it
is
possible
that
she
may
convince
herself
of
the
dreadful
necessity
that
she
may
elevate
herself
to
the
thought
of
my
deliverance
that
she
may
experience
a
burst
of
savage
energy
that
she
may
accomplish
the
supreme
sacrifice
did
she
not
repeat
just
now
that
she
was
still
ready
to
die
but
her
death
includes
that
of
her
child
therefore
she
is
not
restrained
by
any
religious
prejudice
by
the
fear
of
sinning
since
she
is
ready
to
die
she
is
ready
to
commit
a
double
crime
against
herself
and
against
maternity
on
the
other
hand
she
is
convinced
that
her
existence
on
earth
is
useful
even
indispensable
to
the
persons
who
love
her
and
whom
she
loves
and
she
is
also
convinced
that
the
existence
of
the
son
who
is
not
mine
will
make
an
intolerable
torture
of
our
lives
she
knows
too
that
we
could
draw
closer
together
that
we
could
perhaps
in
forgiveness
and
forgetfulness
regain
some
happiness
that
we
could
hope
from
time
the
cure
of
the
wound
if
between
her
and
me
no
intruder
interposed
it
suffices
then
that
she
should
reflect
on
all
that
to
rapidly
convert
a
useless
desire
and
an
inefficacious
prayer
into
a
resolution
and
an
act
i
meditated
she
also
meditated
silently
her
head
lowered
without
removing
her
hand
from
mine
while
deep
in
the
shadows
of
the
great
motionless
elms
what
were
her
thoughts
her
brow
still
retained
the
pallor
of
death
with
the
fall
of
evening
was
another
shadow
descending
upon
her
too
i
seemed
to
see
raymond
but
no
longer
in
the
form
of
a
perverse
and
treacherous
child
but
with
the
form
of
a
miserable
little
body
soft
and
reddish
scarcely
breathing
and
which
the
slightest
pressure
would
kill
the
bell
at
the
badiola
sounded
the
first
strokes
of
the
angelus
juliana
withdrew
her
hand
from
mine
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
the
fourth
and
fifth
months
passed
and
the
gestation
began
to
develop
rapidly
juliana
s
person
slender
supple
and
flexible
enlarged
and
naturally
conformed
to
her
condition
she
felt
herself
humiliated
before
me
as
by
a
disgraceful
infirmity
a
poignant
suffering
appeared
on
her
face
when
she
caught
my
eyes
fixed
on
her
heavy
figure
i
felt
overwhelmed
incapable
of
bearing
any
longer
the
weight
of
this
miserable
existence
every
morning
when
i
opened
my
eyes
after
an
agitated
slumber
i
felt
as
if
someone
had
given
me
a
deep
cup
saying
if
you
wish
to
drink
if
you
wish
to
live
you
must
shed
into
this
cup
the
last
drop
of
your
heart
s
blood
at
each
awakening
a
repugnance
a
disgust
an
indefinable
repulsion
assailed
me
in
the
most
secret
recesses
of
my
being
and
yet
i
must
live
the
days
were
cruelly
long
time
scarcely
passed
it
fell
drop
by
drop
lazily
and
heavily
and
i
still
had
the
summer
before
me
part
of
the
autumn
an
eternity
i
tried
to
imitate
my
brother
to
aid
him
in
the
extensive
agricultural
labors
that
he
had
undertaken
to
become
enthusiastic
with
the
fire
of
his
faith
i
remained
on
horseback
for
whole
days
like
a
i
tired
myself
out
with
manual
labor
at
some
easy
and
monotonous
employment
i
sought
to
dull
the
point
of
my
conscience
by
a
prolonged
contact
with
the
men
of
the
soil
simple
and
upright
souls
those
whom
the
moral
precepts
received
from
their
ancestors
prompted
to
perform
their
functions
just
as
naturally
as
the
corporeal
organs
performed
theirs
several
times
i
went
to
visit
giovanni
di
scordio
the
hermit
saint
i
wished
to
hear
his
voice
i
wished
to
interrogate
him
concerning
his
misfortunes
i
wished
to
see
once
more
his
sad
eyes
and
his
sweet
smile
but
he
hardly
spoke
he
was
a
little
timid
with
me
he
barely
answered
me
by
a
few
vague
words
he
did
not
love
to
speak
of
himself
he
did
not
care
to
complain
he
did
not
stop
at
the
labor
at
which
he
was
occupied
his
hands
bony
dried
and
sunburnt
that
seemed
as
if
cast
in
living
bronze
were
never
idle
perhaps
did
not
know
fatigue
one
day
i
exclaimed
when
will
your
hands
ever
rest
the
good
man
looked
down
at
his
hands
with
a
smile
he
looked
at
the
backs
and
then
at
the
palms
turned
them
over
and
over
in
the
sunlight
that
look
that
smile
that
sunlight
that
gesture
conferred
on
those
great
calloused
hands
a
sovereign
nobility
hardened
by
the
agricultural
instruments
sanctified
by
the
good
they
had
shed
by
the
immense
labor
they
had
performed
those
hands
were
now
worthy
of
bearing
the
palm
the
old
man
crossed
them
on
his
breast
according
to
the
christian
mortuary
rites
and
answered
without
ceasing
to
smile
very
soon
signor
if
it
please
god
when
i
am
laid
in
this
fashion
in
the
coffin
amen
every
remedy
was
tried
in
vain
labor
did
not
solace
me
did
not
console
me
because
it
was
excessive
unequal
irregular
feverish
frequently
interrupted
by
periods
of
unconquerable
inertia
and
depression
my
brother
warned
me
you
are
not
following
the
proper
rule
you
spend
in
one
week
six
months
energy
then
you
let
yourself
fall
back
into
indolence
then
without
moderation
you
recommence
to
exhaust
yourself
with
fatigue
that
is
not
what
health
demands
to
be
effective
your
work
must
be
calm
concordant
harmonic
do
you
understand
we
must
prescribe
a
method
for
you
but
you
have
the
fault
of
all
ardor
later
on
you
will
be
calmer
my
brother
said
you
have
not
yet
found
your
equilibrium
you
do
not
yet
feel
beneath
your
feet
but
have
no
fear
sooner
or
later
you
will
succeed
in
grasping
the
law
that
will
come
to
you
unexpectedly
when
you
least
expect
it
he
said
also
this
time
juliana
will
surely
give
you
an
i
have
already
thought
of
the
godfather
giovanni
di
scordio
will
hold
your
son
at
the
baptismal
font
he
is
the
worthiest
godfather
you
could
possibly
find
for
him
giovanni
will
inspire
him
with
goodness
and
strength
when
raymond
is
old
enough
to
understand
we
will
speak
to
him
of
this
noble
old
man
and
your
son
will
be
what
we
could
not
have
been
what
we
have
not
been
able
to
be
he
often
returned
to
this
subject
he
often
pronounced
the
name
of
raymond
he
prayed
for
the
child
to
be
born
his
incarnate
ideal
of
the
human
model
he
did
not
know
that
every
one
of
his
words
was
for
me
like
the
thrust
of
a
poniard
which
exasperated
my
hate
and
rendered
my
despair
more
violent
everyone
conspired
against
me
unknowingly
everyone
was
constantly
distressing
me
when
i
approached
one
of
my
family
i
felt
anxious
and
fearful
as
if
i
were
compelled
to
remain
near
a
person
who
holding
some
terrible
weapon
knew
neither
how
to
use
it
nor
its
danger
i
was
in
continual
expectation
of
being
wounded
to
enjoy
a
short
truce
i
was
compelled
to
seek
solitude
and
flee
far
from
my
own
but
in
solitude
i
found
myself
face
to
face
with
my
worst
enemy
myself
i
felt
that
i
was
secretly
going
into
a
decline
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
life
was
ebbing
away
through
every
pore
at
times
there
were
reproduced
in
me
conditions
of
soul
that
had
belonged
to
the
most
obscure
period
of
my
past
henceforth
so
distant
at
times
i
preserved
only
the
intimate
feeling
of
my
own
isolation
amidst
the
inert
phantoms
of
all
things
for
long
hours
i
had
no
other
sensation
but
that
of
the
continuous
and
crushing
weight
of
life
and
of
that
of
the
slight
throbbing
of
an
artery
in
my
head
then
survened
ironies
sarcasms
against
myself
sudden
furious
desires
to
rend
and
destroy
pitiless
derisions
ferocious
wickedness
an
acute
fermentation
of
the
most
abject
dregs
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
no
longer
knew
what
indulgence
pity
tenderness
goodness
meant
every
inner
source
of
good
was
obstructed
dried
up
like
fountains
stricken
by
a
malediction
and
then
i
no
longer
saw
in
juliana
anything
but
the
brutal
fact
the
pregnancy
i
no
longer
saw
in
myself
anything
but
the
ridiculed
person
the
satirized
husband
the
stupid
hero
of
the
classic
farce
the
inner
sarcasm
spared
none
of
my
actions
none
of
juliana
s
actions
the
drama
became
metamorphosed
for
me
into
a
bitter
and
farcical
comedy
nothing
restrained
me
longer
every
bond
broke
a
violent
rupture
took
place
and
i
said
to
myself
why
should
i
rest
here
and
play
this
odious
rôle
i
will
go
away
go
back
into
society
back
to
my
early
life
back
to
libertinism
i
will
close
my
eyes
to
everything
i
will
lose
myself
what
does
it
matter
i
do
not
wish
to
be
what
i
am
mire
within
mire
phew
during
one
of
these
attacks
i
resolved
to
leave
the
badiola
to
depart
for
rome
to
go
i
knew
not
where
i
had
a
pretext
ready
as
we
had
not
anticipated
so
long
an
absence
we
had
left
the
town
house
temporarily
it
was
urgent
to
regulate
various
affairs
and
take
measures
that
our
absence
might
be
prolonged
indefinitely
i
announced
my
departure
i
persuaded
my
mother
brother
and
juliana
that
it
was
necessary
i
promised
to
hurry
and
return
in
a
few
days
i
made
my
preparations
the
evening
before
i
left
late
in
the
night
while
i
was
strapping
a
valise
i
heard
a
knock
at
my
door
i
said
come
in
i
was
surprised
to
see
juliana
ah
is
it
you
i
went
forward
to
meet
her
she
was
panting
a
little
fatigued
perhaps
by
the
stairs
i
made
her
sit
down
i
offered
her
a
cup
of
cold
tea
with
a
thin
slice
of
lemon
a
beverage
that
used
to
please
her
and
that
had
been
prepared
for
me
she
scarcely
wet
her
lips
and
handed
it
back
her
eyes
revealed
her
anxiety
finally
she
said
timidly
so
you
are
going
yes
i
replied
morning
as
you
know
then
followed
a
long
interval
of
silence
through
the
open
windows
entered
a
delicious
coolness
the
rays
of
the
full
moon
lit
up
the
house
and
garden
the
choir
of
chirping
crickets
could
be
heard
like
the
sharp
and
indefinitely
distant
sound
of
a
flute
she
asked
me
in
a
changed
voice
when
will
you
return
tell
me
frankly
do
not
i
answered
there
was
a
new
pause
a
light
breeze
came
in
from
time
to
time
and
the
curtains
swelled
every
breath
carried
into
the
room
as
far
as
us
the
voluptuousness
of
that
summer
night
are
you
deserting
me
there
was
such
profound
distress
in
her
voice
that
my
studied
coolness
suddenly
gave
way
to
regret
and
pity
no
i
answered
don
t
be
alarmed
juliana
i
need
a
little
rest
i
can
stand
it
no
longer
i
must
have
breathing
room
you
are
right
she
answered
i
think
i
shall
soon
come
back
as
i
promised
i
will
write
to
you
you
too
will
perhaps
feel
relief
at
not
seeing
me
suffer
relief
she
said
no
never
a
choking
sob
quivered
in
her
voice
she
added
immediately
in
a
tone
of
anguish
tullio
tullio
tell
me
the
truth
do
you
hate
me
tell
me
the
truth
her
eyes
interrogated
me
more
agonized
even
than
her
words
for
an
instant
her
very
soul
seemed
fixed
on
me
and
those
poor
eyes
wide
open
that
brow
that
contracted
mouth
that
emaciated
chin
all
that
frail
unhappy
face
which
contrasted
with
the
lower
ignominious
deformity
and
those
hands
those
frail
sorrowful
hands
that
stretched
toward
me
with
such
a
supplicating
gesture
pained
me
more
than
ever
moved
me
to
pity
and
sympathy
believe
me
juliana
believe
me
once
for
all
i
feel
no
resentment
toward
you
and
i
never
shall
i
do
not
forget
that
i
am
your
debtor
i
forget
nothing
have
i
not
already
proved
it
be
reassured
think
now
of
your
and
besides
who
knows
but
in
any
case
juliana
i
will
not
disappoint
you
let
me
go
for
the
time
being
perhaps
a
few
days
absence
will
do
me
good
i
shall
be
calmer
when
i
return
calmness
is
very
necessary
for
what
is
to
follow
you
will
need
all
my
assistance
she
said
thank
you
do
with
me
what
you
will
a
human
chant
now
came
to
us
through
the
darkness
covering
the
shrill
sound
of
the
rural
a
choir
of
reapers
in
the
moonlight
on
some
distant
field
do
you
hear
i
said
we
listened
we
felt
the
breath
of
the
breeze
all
the
voluptuousness
of
the
summer
night
filled
my
heart
shall
we
go
and
sit
down
on
the
terrace
i
asked
juliana
gently
she
consented
and
rose
we
passed
through
an
adjoining
room
where
there
was
no
other
light
than
that
of
the
full
moon
a
great
white
wave
resembling
immaterial
milk
inundated
the
floor
as
she
preceded
me
to
go
out
on
the
terrace
i
could
see
her
deformed
shadow
outlined
in
black
in
the
light
ah
where
was
the
slender
and
supple
creature
whom
i
had
taken
in
my
arms
where
was
the
lover
i
had
found
once
more
beneath
the
flowering
lilacs
that
april
noon
in
a
second
my
heart
was
invaded
with
every
regret
with
every
desire
with
every
despair
juliana
sat
down
and
leaned
her
head
on
the
iron
of
the
balustrade
her
face
fully
illuminated
was
whiter
than
all
its
surroundings
whiter
than
the
wall
her
eyes
were
the
eyelids
cast
a
shadow
on
her
that
agitated
me
more
than
a
look
would
have
done
how
could
i
utter
a
word
i
turned
toward
the
valley
and
leaned
on
the
balustrade
grasping
the
cold
iron
with
my
fingers
i
saw
beneath
me
an
enormous
heap
of
confused
appearances
in
which
i
noticed
only
the
reflection
of
the
assoro
the
chant
came
to
us
or
was
interrupted
as
the
breeze
rose
or
fell
and
during
the
pauses
was
again
heard
the
shrill
indefinitely
distant
never
had
a
night
appeared
to
me
so
full
of
sweetness
and
sorrow
from
the
extreme
depth
of
my
soul
arose
a
cry
piercing
and
yet
not
audible
towards
the
lost
felicity
scarcely
had
i
arrived
in
rome
when
i
was
sorry
i
had
come
i
found
the
city
burning
hot
on
fire
almost
deserted
and
that
frightened
me
the
house
was
silent
as
the
tomb
and
the
familiar
objects
i
knew
so
well
presented
an
unusual
and
strange
aspect
and
that
also
frightened
me
i
felt
a
sensation
of
solitude
frightful
solitude
and
yet
i
did
not
go
in
search
of
friends
i
did
not
wish
to
remember
or
meet
anyone
but
i
began
a
search
for
the
man
whom
i
detested
with
an
implacable
hate
the
search
for
filippo
arborio
i
hoped
to
meet
him
in
some
public
place
i
went
to
the
restaurant
which
i
knew
he
frequented
i
waited
for
him
an
entire
evening
premeditating
the
way
in
which
i
would
provoke
him
each
time
i
heard
a
step
of
a
new
arrival
my
heart
gave
a
bound
but
he
did
not
come
i
questioned
the
waiters
they
had
not
seen
him
for
a
long
time
i
went
to
the
salle
d
armes
the
rooms
were
empty
bathed
in
the
greenish
shadow
made
by
the
closed
blinds
filled
with
that
peculiar
odor
which
rises
from
wooden
floors
when
they
are
sprinkled
the
maestro
deserted
by
his
pupils
greeted
me
with
the
greatest
demonstrations
of
amiability
i
listened
attentively
to
the
minute
details
of
the
last
assault
then
i
asked
him
for
news
of
several
of
my
friends
who
frequented
the
salle
finally
i
asked
him
about
filippo
arborio
he
has
not
been
in
rome
for
four
or
five
months
replied
the
maestro
i
have
heard
that
he
has
a
very
serious
and
almost
incurable
nervous
malady
i
heard
it
from
galiffa
but
that
s
all
i
know
about
it
he
added
in
fact
he
was
very
very
weak
he
only
took
a
few
lessons
from
me
he
was
afraid
to
fence
he
could
not
bear
to
see
the
point
of
a
sword
before
his
eyes
is
galiffa
still
in
rome
no
he
is
at
rimini
shortly
after
i
went
away
this
unexpected
news
startled
me
if
it
were
only
true
i
thought
and
i
took
pleasure
in
imagining
that
it
was
one
of
those
terrible
maladies
of
the
spinal
cord
or
of
the
cerebral
substance
that
reduce
a
man
to
the
lowest
degradations
to
idiocy
to
the
most
pitiful
forms
of
madness
and
finally
to
death
the
knowledge
i
had
gained
from
scientific
books
the
recollections
of
a
visit
i
had
paid
to
an
insane
asylum
the
images
still
more
precise
that
i
retained
of
a
special
case
of
one
of
my
friends
spinelli
repassed
through
my
memory
in
a
crowd
and
once
more
i
saw
poor
spinelli
seated
in
his
big
the
color
of
clay
every
line
of
his
face
paralyzed
his
mouth
drawn
and
gaping
full
of
saliva
and
stammering
incomprehensibly
again
i
saw
the
gesture
he
made
every
little
while
to
receive
in
his
handkerchief
that
inexhaustible
saliva
that
ran
down
the
corners
of
his
mouth
again
i
saw
the
blond
thin
and
sorrowful
face
of
the
sister
adjusting
a
napkin
beneath
the
invalid
s
chin
as
on
a
baby
and
introducing
into
his
stomach
with
the
pharyngeal
sound
the
nourishment
he
was
no
longer
capable
of
swallowing
so
much
the
better
i
thought
if
i
had
fought
a
duel
with
so
celebrated
an
adversary
if
i
had
wounded
him
seriously
if
i
had
killed
him
the
fact
would
certainly
not
pass
unnoticed
it
would
be
in
every
mouth
it
would
get
into
the
papers
and
perhaps
the
true
cause
of
the
duel
would
also
be
found
out
this
providential
malady
on
the
contrary
spares
me
all
danger
all
annoyance
all
gossip
i
may
well
renounce
a
sanguinary
joy
a
punishment
inflicted
by
my
own
hand
and
besides
am
i
sure
of
the
result
since
i
know
that
disease
paralyzes
and
saps
the
power
of
the
man
i
detest
but
is
the
news
true
perhaps
it
is
only
a
temporary
illness
a
happy
idea
struck
me
i
jumped
into
a
cab
and
drove
to
the
office
of
his
publisher
during
the
drive
i
mentally
pictured
to
a
sincere
wish
that
he
might
be
stricken
by
two
cerebral
diseases
most
terrible
for
a
man
of
letters
for
an
artist
in
language
for
a
stylist
aphasia
and
agraphia
and
an
imaginary
vision
presented
their
symptoms
to
me
i
entered
the
office
at
first
i
could
distinguish
nothing
my
eyes
still
blinded
by
the
outer
light
but
i
heard
a
nasal
voice
questioning
me
in
a
strange
tone
what
can
i
do
for
signor
i
perceived
behind
the
desk
a
person
of
uncertain
age
a
dry
pallid
fair
man
a
sort
of
an
albino
i
turned
toward
him
mentioned
the
titles
of
several
works
i
bought
a
few
then
i
inquired
for
the
last
novel
by
filippo
arborio
the
albino
handed
me
i
feigned
to
be
a
fanatical
admirer
of
the
novelist
is
this
really
his
last
yes
signor
a
month
or
two
ago
we
announced
a
new
novel
by
him
eburnea
my
heart
throbbed
but
i
do
not
think
we
can
publish
it
why
not
the
author
is
very
ill
what
s
the
matter
a
progressive
paralysis
of
the
medulla
oblongata
replied
the
albino
separating
the
terrible
words
with
a
certain
scientific
affectation
oh
the
same
illness
that
spinelli
had
so
it
is
serious
very
serious
said
the
albino
sententiously
signor
knows
that
there
is
no
cure
for
that
form
of
paralysis
but
it
is
still
only
in
its
earliest
stage
yes
but
there
is
no
doubt
as
to
its
nature
the
last
time
he
came
here
i
could
already
detect
that
he
had
difficulty
in
articulating
certain
words
ah
you
heard
him
yes
signor
his
pronunciation
was
already
indefinite
and
vacillating
i
encouraged
the
albino
by
the
extreme
and
so
to
speak
admiring
attention
that
i
paid
to
him
i
believe
that
he
would
voluntarily
have
acquainted
me
with
the
words
that
had
been
pronounced
with
such
difficulty
by
the
illustrious
novelist
and
where
is
he
now
he
is
at
naples
the
doctors
are
treating
him
with
electricity
electric
treatment
i
repeated
with
artless
stupor
an
affectation
of
ignorance
so
as
to
please
the
albino
s
vanity
and
thus
prolong
the
conversation
it
is
true
that
in
the
shop
narrow
and
long
like
a
corridor
there
flowed
a
draught
of
cool
air
that
favored
chatting
the
place
was
shaded
a
clerk
slept
peacefully
in
a
chair
his
chin
on
his
bosom
in
the
shadow
of
a
terrestrial
globe
nobody
entered
there
was
something
ridiculous
about
the
bookseller
his
sallow
face
his
shrivelled
mouth
and
nasal
twang
amused
me
and
in
the
quiet
of
the
bookshop
it
was
very
agreeable
to
hear
the
confirmation
of
the
incurable
malady
of
a
man
abhorred
have
the
doctors
no
hope
of
curing
him
i
said
to
stimulate
the
albino
impossible
let
us
hope
it
is
possible
for
the
sake
of
literature
impossible
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
progressive
paralysis
there
are
cases
that
have
been
cured
no
signor
no
he
may
live
two
three
four
years
yet
but
he
can
not
be
cured
it
seems
to
me
i
do
not
know
from
whence
came
this
lightness
of
heart
that
made
me
make
sport
of
the
narrator
of
this
news
this
curious
complaisance
to
relish
the
cruelty
of
my
sentiment
but
i
certainly
found
pleasure
in
it
and
the
albino
piqued
by
my
contradictions
climbed
without
further
argument
up
a
small
wooden
ladder
leaning
against
the
high
shelves
thin
as
he
was
he
resembled
one
of
those
vagabond
cats
fleshless
and
hairless
that
crouch
on
the
edge
of
a
roof
as
he
reached
the
top
his
head
brushed
against
a
cord
stretched
from
one
corner
of
the
shop
to
the
other
and
which
served
as
a
resting
place
for
flies
a
cloud
of
the
insects
swarmed
around
his
head
with
a
furious
buzzing
he
came
down
holding
a
book
in
his
authority
which
declared
in
favor
of
death
the
implacable
flies
descended
with
him
he
showed
me
the
title
it
was
a
special
work
on
pathology
signor
will
see
he
turned
over
the
leaves
as
the
book
was
not
cut
he
separated
the
leaves
with
his
finger
and
lowering
his
whitish
eyes
read
inside
prognosis
of
progressive
bulbar
paralysis
is
he
added
is
signor
convinced
now
yes
but
what
a
misfortune
such
a
talented
man
the
flies
could
not
be
quieted
they
were
buzzing
in
a
provoking
manner
they
attacked
the
albino
me
and
the
assistant
who
was
sleeping
under
the
terrestrial
globe
how
old
i
asked
involuntarily
erring
about
the
tense
of
the
verb
as
if
i
referred
to
a
dead
man
who
signor
filippo
arborio
i
believe
so
young
i
felt
a
strange
desire
to
laugh
a
puerile
desire
to
laugh
in
the
albino
s
face
and
to
leave
him
it
was
a
very
singular
excitation
rather
convulsive
never
before
felt
indefinable
my
mind
was
shaken
by
something
similar
to
the
strange
and
uncontrollable
hilarity
that
seizes
one
at
times
in
the
surprising
incoherences
of
a
dream
the
book
was
still
open
and
lay
on
the
bench
and
i
bent
over
it
to
examine
a
vignette
that
represented
a
human
face
contorted
by
a
grimace
atrocious
and
grotesque
of
the
left
the
implacable
flies
still
buzzed
ceaselessly
have
you
not
received
the
manuscript
of
yet
i
asked
no
signor
we
have
announced
the
book
but
the
title
is
all
that
exists
only
the
title
yes
signor
and
in
fact
we
have
stopped
announcing
the
book
thank
you
please
send
these
books
to
my
house
sometime
i
gave
my
address
and
left
on
the
pavement
i
felt
a
strange
sensation
of
bewilderment
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
i
had
left
behind
me
a
fragment
of
an
artificial
false
factitious
life
what
i
had
done
what
i
had
said
what
i
had
felt
and
the
albino
s
face
his
voice
his
gestures
all
seemed
unreal
took
on
the
appearance
of
a
dream
the
character
of
an
impression
received
not
from
contact
with
the
reality
but
from
a
book
recently
read
i
entered
the
cab
again
and
returned
home
the
vague
sensation
faded
away
i
began
to
calmly
reflect
i
assured
myself
that
all
was
real
indisputable
spontaneously
visions
of
the
sick
man
formed
before
me
copied
on
those
furnished
me
by
my
recollections
of
poor
spinelli
and
i
was
seized
by
new
curiosity
suppose
i
go
to
naples
to
see
him
i
pictured
to
myself
the
pitiful
spectacle
of
that
intellectual
man
degraded
by
disease
stammering
like
an
idiot
i
no
longer
felt
any
joy
all
the
exaltation
of
my
hate
had
fallen
a
profound
sadness
overwhelmed
me
in
fact
the
ruin
of
this
man
had
no
influence
on
my
own
position
did
not
repair
my
own
ruin
there
was
nothing
changed
neither
in
me
nor
in
my
actual
situation
nor
in
my
previsions
of
the
future
and
i
thought
of
the
title
of
the
book
announced
by
filippo
arborio
doubts
pressed
in
a
crowd
in
my
mind
did
that
dedication
refer
to
an
accidental
encounter
or
rather
on
the
contrary
had
the
writer
had
the
intention
of
creating
a
literary
type
after
the
image
of
juliana
hermil
of
relating
his
recent
and
personal
adventure
the
torturing
problem
presented
itself
anew
what
had
been
the
progressive
incidents
of
this
adventure
from
the
beginning
to
its
close
and
i
thought
i
could
hear
the
words
uttered
by
juliana
that
unforgettable
night
i
love
you
i
have
always
loved
you
i
have
always
been
yours
i
expiate
by
this
hell
one
moment
s
weakness
you
understand
moment
s
it
is
the
truth
do
you
not
feel
that
it
is
the
truth
alas
how
often
we
believe
we
feel
the
truth
in
a
voice
that
lies
nothing
can
guard
us
from
being
thus
duped
but
if
what
i
had
felt
in
juliana
s
voice
was
the
pure
truth
then
had
she
really
been
taken
during
a
physical
languor
in
my
very
house
had
she
submitted
with
a
sort
of
unconsciousness
and
on
awakening
had
she
felt
only
horror
and
disgust
at
the
irreparable
act
and
had
she
banished
that
man
had
she
never
seen
him
again
this
supposition
in
fact
was
in
nowise
contradicted
by
appearances
and
appearances
even
supported
the
supposition
that
for
a
long
time
the
rupture
between
juliana
and
him
was
complete
and
definite
in
my
own
house
i
repeated
and
in
this
house
silent
as
a
tomb
in
these
deserted
and
close
rooms
i
was
followed
by
the
obsession
of
the
vision
what
should
i
do
stay
longer
in
rome
until
madness
seized
my
brain
in
the
midst
of
this
furnace
during
the
heat
of
the
go
to
the
seaside
to
the
mountains
seek
oblivion
in
society
at
the
fashionable
summer
resorts
reawaken
in
myself
the
voluptuousness
go
in
quest
of
another
teresa
raffo
any
sort
of
frivolity
two
or
three
times
i
dwelt
on
the
remembrance
of
the
although
she
had
entirely
passed
from
my
heart
and
even
for
a
long
time
from
my
memory
where
could
she
be
is
she
still
with
eugenio
egano
what
would
be
my
sensations
on
seeing
her
again
it
was
only
vain
curiosity
i
perceived
that
my
sole
profound
unconquerable
desire
was
to
go
back
there
to
my
house
of
sorrow
to
my
torture
i
took
the
necessary
measures
with
the
greatest
care
i
paid
a
visit
to
vebesti
and
wired
to
the
badiola
that
i
was
on
the
way
home
impatience
devoured
me
acute
anxiety
urged
me
on
as
if
i
were
to
encounter
new
and
extraordinary
things
the
journey
appeared
interminable
stretched
on
the
cushions
oppressed
by
the
heat
suffocated
by
the
dust
that
penetrated
through
the
interstices
of
the
railway
carriage
i
thought
of
the
approaching
events
i
considered
the
future
possibilities
i
essayed
to
read
the
great
darkness
the
was
mortally
tainted
what
could
be
expected
of
the
son
there
was
nothing
new
at
the
badiola
my
absence
had
been
very
short
they
celebrated
my
return
juliana
s
first
look
expressed
infinite
gratitude
you
have
done
well
to
return
so
quickly
said
my
mother
with
a
smile
juliana
could
not
get
any
rest
now
we
hope
you
will
not
leave
us
again
apropos
did
you
think
of
that
lace
no
what
a
memory
you
have
as
soon
as
i
was
alone
with
juliana
she
said
i
did
not
dare
hope
you
would
return
so
quickly
how
grateful
i
am
in
her
attitude
in
her
voice
there
were
timidity
humility
tenderness
never
had
i
been
so
struck
by
the
contrast
between
her
face
and
the
rest
of
her
person
on
that
face
there
was
continually
visible
to
me
a
special
expression
of
sorrow
that
expressed
the
constant
revolt
of
this
woman
against
the
shame
that
had
fallen
upon
her
that
expression
never
left
her
under
any
circumstance
it
could
be
visibly
seen
through
the
diversity
of
other
fugitive
expressions
which
no
matter
how
strong
could
not
efface
it
it
was
fixed
and
adherent
and
it
moved
me
to
pity
and
took
from
me
my
anger
what
did
you
do
while
i
was
away
i
asked
her
waited
for
you
and
you
nothing
i
wanted
to
return
to
see
me
she
asked
timid
and
humble
yes
for
your
sake
she
her
eyes
and
the
light
of
a
smile
trembled
on
her
face
i
felt
that
i
had
never
been
loved
as
at
that
instant
after
a
pause
she
said
regarding
me
with
humid
eyes
thank
you
the
tone
the
sentiment
expressed
recalled
to
me
another
that
she
had
said
at
another
time
the
morning
of
her
convalescence
the
morning
of
my
first
crime
thus
i
recommenced
at
the
badiola
my
invariably
sad
life
unrelieved
by
any
notable
incident
the
hours
dragging
along
on
the
and
the
feeling
of
desolation
aggravated
by
the
heavy
monotony
of
the
chirp
of
the
crickets
in
the
elms
est
benefaciendi
and
in
my
mind
there
alternated
the
usual
effervescences
the
usual
inertias
sarcasms
the
usual
vain
aspirations
contradictory
crises
abundance
and
dryness
and
more
than
once
reflecting
on
that
gray
neutral
ordinary
fluid
and
omnipotent
thing
called
life
i
thought
who
knows
man
is
above
all
an
animal
who
adapts
himself
there
is
neither
turpitude
nor
pain
to
which
in
the
end
he
does
not
accustom
himself
perhaps
in
the
long
run
i
shall
also
become
used
to
it
who
knows
i
sterilized
myself
by
dint
of
irony
who
knows
if
filippo
arborio
s
son
will
not
be
so
to
say
very
then
the
arrangement
would
only
be
easier
i
thought
of
the
cynical
laugh
that
had
been
provoked
in
me
one
day
when
in
the
presence
of
a
married
couple
i
had
heard
them
refer
to
a
baby
who
i
knew
for
a
certainty
was
the
fruit
of
adultery
as
it
s
just
like
his
father
and
in
reality
the
resemblance
was
striking
from
the
influence
of
that
mysterious
law
known
to
physiologists
as
by
often
a
woman
married
a
second
time
brings
into
the
world
some
years
after
the
death
of
her
first
husband
sons
who
have
every
feature
of
the
dead
husband
and
who
do
not
resemble
at
all
their
real
father
it
is
possible
therefore
that
raymond
resemble
me
and
appear
to
be
a
veritable
hermil
i
thought
it
might
happen
that
i
am
warmly
congratulated
upon
having
so
vigorously
impressed
upon
the
heir
the
seal
of
my
race
and
suppose
my
mother
s
and
brother
s
expectations
are
not
fulfilled
suppose
juliana
gives
birth
to
a
third
daughter
that
probability
calmed
me
it
seemed
to
me
i
should
feel
less
repulsion
for
a
new
daughter
and
that
perhaps
i
might
even
succeed
in
tolerating
her
with
time
she
would
leave
my
house
take
another
name
enter
another
family
meantime
the
nearer
the
term
approached
the
more
my
irritation
increased
i
was
weary
of
constantly
debating
with
myself
in
the
same
fruitless
agitation
amidst
the
same
fears
and
perplexities
i
should
have
liked
events
to
be
precipitated
a
catastrophe
of
some
sort
to
occur
no
matter
what
catastrophe
was
preferable
to
this
agony
one
day
my
brother
asked
juliana
how
long
will
it
be
yet
she
answered
another
month
we
were
in
september
summer
was
drawing
to
a
close
we
were
approaching
the
autumnal
equinox
the
most
charming
period
of
the
year
the
season
that
bears
in
itself
a
sort
of
aerial
intoxication
emanating
from
the
ripe
grapes
the
enchantment
gradually
penetrated
me
soothed
my
soul
at
times
inspired
in
me
a
desire
for
furious
tendernesses
or
delicate
expansions
maria
and
natalia
passed
long
hours
with
me
alone
with
me
either
in
my
apartment
or
out
in
the
surrounding
country
i
had
never
loved
them
before
with
a
love
so
deep
so
anxious
from
their
eyes
softly
impregnated
with
scarcely
conscious
thoughts
there
at
times
descended
on
my
soul
a
ray
of
peace
one
day
i
was
seeking
juliana
throughout
the
badiola
it
was
in
the
early
afternoon
as
i
found
her
neither
in
her
room
nor
anywhere
else
i
entered
my
mother
s
room
the
doors
were
open
neither
sound
nor
voice
was
heard
the
light
curtains
waved
at
the
windows
through
the
open
were
glimpses
of
the
verdure
of
the
elms
between
the
brightly
colored
walls
all
breathed
of
peace
and
repose
i
advanced
cautiously
toward
the
sanctuary
i
walked
softly
in
order
not
to
disturb
my
mother
in
case
she
were
dozing
i
parted
the
curtains
and
without
crossing
the
threshold
i
leaned
forward
and
looked
in
i
heard
in
fact
the
breathing
of
a
person
sleeping
i
saw
my
mother
who
was
sleeping
in
an
in
a
corner
of
the
window
i
saw
juliana
s
hair
above
the
back
of
another
i
entered
they
were
seated
facing
each
other
and
between
them
was
a
low
table
bearing
a
basket
full
of
miniature
bonnets
my
mother
still
held
between
her
fingers
one
of
these
caps
in
which
glittered
a
needle
slumber
had
overtaken
her
during
the
activity
of
her
work
she
was
sleeping
her
chin
on
her
bosom
perhaps
she
was
dreaming
the
needle
was
only
of
white
cotton
but
in
her
dream
perhaps
she
was
sewing
with
a
more
precious
thread
juliana
was
sleeping
also
but
her
head
had
fallen
back
on
the
chair
and
her
arms
were
stretched
out
on
the
supports
in
the
gentleness
of
her
slumber
her
features
were
relaxed
but
her
mouth
retained
a
line
of
distress
a
shadow
of
affliction
half
closed
it
permitted
a
glimpse
of
her
bloodless
gums
but
at
the
beginning
of
the
nose
between
the
eyebrows
there
was
a
small
furrow
deepened
by
great
sorrow
and
her
forehead
was
moist
a
drop
of
perspiration
slowly
rolled
down
her
temple
and
her
hands
whiter
than
the
muslin
from
under
which
they
extended
seemed
by
their
position
alone
to
indicate
an
immense
lassitude
what
struck
me
most
was
less
her
moral
expression
than
the
appearance
of
her
person
i
meditated
without
considering
this
expression
and
even
juliana
herself
had
no
part
in
my
thoughts
and
anew
i
felt
only
the
little
creature
living
beside
me
as
if
at
that
moment
no
other
creature
existed
around
me
and
again
this
was
not
an
illusory
sensation
but
a
real
and
profound
one
fear
ran
through
every
fibre
of
my
being
i
averted
my
eyes
and
i
again
saw
between
her
fingers
the
bonnet
in
which
glittered
the
needle
i
again
saw
all
those
light
laces
in
the
basket
all
those
and
blue
ribbons
that
trembled
at
the
breath
of
the
breeze
my
heart
was
so
strongly
oppressed
that
i
thought
i
should
faint
what
tendernesses
the
hands
of
my
mother
lost
in
her
dream
revealed
those
hands
placed
on
the
pretty
white
thing
destined
to
cover
the
head
of
the
child
who
was
not
my
own
i
remained
there
several
minutes
this
place
was
the
true
sanctuary
of
the
house
the
holy
of
holies
on
one
wall
hung
my
father
s
portrait
whom
federico
greatly
resembled
on
another
that
of
constance
who
resembled
maria
a
little
the
two
faces
living
in
that
superior
existence
in
which
the
recollections
of
those
who
have
loved
them
have
placed
them
had
magnetic
eyes
eyes
that
seemed
to
see
everywhere
other
relics
of
the
two
dead
loved
ones
sanctified
this
retreat
in
one
corner
on
a
pedestal
closed
in
between
plates
of
glass
and
covered
with
black
crape
there
was
the
death
mask
moulded
on
the
corpse
of
the
man
whom
my
mother
had
loved
with
a
passion
stronger
than
death
and
yet
this
room
had
nothing
lugubrious
about
it
there
reigned
in
it
a
sovereign
peace
that
from
thence
seemed
to
propagate
through
the
entire
house
as
life
propagates
from
the
heart
by
a
rhythmic
expansion
i
recall
the
walk
i
made
to
the
lilacs
with
maria
natalia
and
miss
edith
on
a
rather
misty
morning
and
the
recollection
of
it
is
also
rather
misty
veiled
indistinct
like
that
of
a
long
dream
torturing
yet
sweet
the
garden
no
longer
had
its
myriad
of
bluish
grapes
nor
its
exquisite
forest
of
flowers
nor
its
triple
perfume
harmonious
as
music
nor
its
gayety
nor
the
continuous
cries
of
its
swallows
it
was
enlivened
only
by
the
voices
and
gambols
of
the
two
innocent
girls
already
many
of
the
swallows
had
departed
and
the
rest
were
about
to
go
we
had
arrived
in
time
to
see
the
last
flock
all
the
nests
were
abandoned
deserted
lifeless
many
were
broken
and
on
the
clayey
debris
trembled
poor
little
feathers
the
last
flock
gathered
on
the
roof
in
the
gutters
were
still
waiting
for
a
few
dispersed
companions
the
emigrants
stood
on
a
row
on
the
edge
of
the
some
presenting
the
beak
and
others
the
back
so
that
the
little
forked
tails
and
the
white
breasts
alternated
and
while
waiting
they
filled
the
silent
air
with
their
calls
and
from
minute
to
minute
by
twos
by
threes
the
laggards
arrived
the
hour
of
departure
was
at
hand
the
calls
ceased
the
fading
sunlight
fell
on
the
closed
house
on
the
empty
nests
nothing
could
be
sadder
than
those
poor
little
dead
feathers
which
here
and
there
fluttered
held
prisoners
in
the
clay
as
if
raised
up
by
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
by
a
storm
the
flock
rose
up
with
a
great
fluttering
of
wings
ascended
into
the
air
like
a
remained
for
a
moment
directly
above
the
house
then
without
hesitation
as
if
they
had
before
them
a
clearly
traced
path
they
took
their
way
in
a
compact
mass
flew
off
melted
away
in
the
sky
and
finally
disappeared
maria
and
natalia
mounted
on
a
bench
stood
up
on
tiptoe
to
watch
the
fugitives
as
long
as
possible
and
stretching
out
their
arms
they
cried
little
swallows
of
all
the
rest
i
retain
only
an
indistinct
recollection
like
that
of
a
dream
maria
wished
to
enter
the
house
i
opened
the
door
myself
it
was
here
on
these
three
steps
that
juliana
had
followed
me
furtively
light
as
a
shadow
and
had
embraced
me
and
had
whispered
go
in
go
in
in
the
vestibule
the
nest
still
hung
among
the
grotesques
of
the
ceiling
now
i
am
yours
altogether
entirely
she
had
murmured
without
releasing
my
neck
and
by
a
sinuous
movement
she
had
thrown
herself
on
my
breast
and
had
met
my
mouth
the
vestibule
was
staircases
were
silent
silence
reigned
throughout
the
house
it
was
here
that
i
had
heard
the
low
and
distant
hum
like
that
retained
by
certain
shells
in
the
depths
of
their
folds
but
now
the
silence
resembled
that
of
a
tomb
and
this
place
was
the
sepulchre
of
my
happiness
maria
and
natalia
prattled
on
without
cease
did
not
stop
asking
me
questions
showed
themselves
curious
about
everything
went
and
opened
the
drawers
of
the
the
closets
miss
edith
followed
them
watchful
look
see
what
i
have
found
cried
maria
running
toward
me
at
the
bottom
of
a
drawer
she
had
found
a
bouquet
of
lavender
and
a
glove
it
was
one
of
juliana
s
gloves
spotted
with
black
at
the
on
the
inside
near
the
hem
it
bore
the
following
still
visible
inscription
mulberries
january
like
a
flash
my
memory
represented
clearly
to
me
the
episode
of
the
mulberries
one
of
the
happiest
episodes
of
our
first
felicity
a
fragment
of
the
idyll
is
it
one
of
mamma
s
gloves
asked
maria
give
it
to
me
give
it
to
me
i
want
to
take
it
to
her
myself
of
all
the
rest
i
have
but
an
indistinct
recollection
like
a
dream
calisto
the
old
came
to
speak
to
me
he
told
me
a
thousand
things
and
i
understood
almost
nothing
of
what
he
said
several
times
he
repeated
the
wish
a
boy
a
fine
boy
and
may
god
bless
him
a
fine
boy
when
we
were
outside
calisto
closed
the
doors
and
those
nests
those
happy
nests
he
said
shaking
his
handsome
white
head
they
must
not
be
touched
calisto
every
nest
was
deserted
empty
lifeless
their
last
habitants
had
left
them
a
languorous
kiss
from
the
setting
sun
touched
the
closed
house
the
solitary
nests
and
there
could
be
nothing
sadder
than
those
poor
little
dead
feathers
that
here
and
there
trembled
prisoners
in
the
clay
the
term
approached
the
first
half
of
october
had
passed
doctor
vebesti
had
been
notified
my
anxiety
increased
hourly
became
intolerable
i
was
frequently
assailed
by
attacks
of
madness
similar
to
that
which
had
seized
me
on
the
banks
of
the
assoro
i
fled
far
from
the
badiola
remained
long
hours
on
horseback
i
compelled
orlando
to
jump
hedges
and
trenches
i
forced
him
into
perilous
paths
at
a
gallop
then
the
poor
animal
and
i
returned
streaming
tired
but
always
safely
doctor
vebesti
arrived
everybody
at
the
badiola
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
confidence
and
hope
reappeared
juliana
alone
was
unnerved
and
more
than
once
i
detected
in
her
eyes
the
passage
of
a
sinister
thought
the
sombre
light
of
a
fixed
idea
the
horror
of
a
lugubrious
presentiment
the
pains
of
childbirth
began
they
lasted
an
entire
day
with
a
few
periods
of
suspension
at
times
stronger
sometimes
weaker
at
times
bearable
and
sometimes
agonizing
she
remained
standing
leaning
on
a
table
her
back
against
a
closet
clenching
her
teeth
so
as
not
to
cry
out
or
else
she
sat
in
an
and
remained
in
it
almost
motionless
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
uttering
at
times
a
suppressed
groan
or
else
she
ceaselessly
changed
her
place
going
from
one
corner
to
another
stopping
here
and
there
to
convulsively
twist
between
her
fingers
the
first
object
at
hand
the
sight
of
her
suffering
tortured
me
i
could
not
stand
it
i
left
the
room
went
out
for
a
few
minutes
then
i
returned
almost
in
spite
of
myself
as
if
drawn
by
a
magnetic
attraction
and
i
forced
myself
to
watch
her
suffering
without
power
to
speak
one
comforting
word
to
her
tullio
tullio
what
a
horrible
thing
oh
what
a
horrible
thing
i
have
never
suffered
so
much
never
never
night
fell
my
mother
miss
edith
and
the
doctor
had
gone
down
to
the
juliana
and
i
were
alone
the
lamps
had
not
yet
been
brought
in
october
s
purplish
twilight
entered
the
room
from
time
to
time
the
wind
shook
the
windows
help
me
tullio
help
me
she
cried
in
the
bewilderment
of
the
spasm
her
arms
stretched
toward
me
looking
at
me
with
dilated
eyes
whose
whites
were
of
an
extraordinary
whiteness
in
the
darkness
that
made
her
face
livid
tell
me
tell
me
what
can
i
do
to
help
you
i
stammered
distracted
not
knowing
what
to
do
caressing
the
hair
on
her
temples
with
a
gesture
in
which
i
would
have
liked
to
impart
a
supernatural
power
tell
me
tell
me
what
shall
i
do
she
stopped
complaining
she
looked
at
me
listened
to
me
as
if
forgetful
of
her
pain
as
if
seized
by
surprise
stupefied
no
doubt
by
the
sound
of
my
voice
by
the
expression
of
my
bewilderment
and
anguish
by
the
trembling
of
my
fingers
on
her
hair
by
the
distressed
tenderness
of
that
inefficacious
gesture
you
love
me
don
t
you
she
said
without
ceasing
to
look
at
me
as
if
not
to
lose
the
slightest
sign
of
my
emotion
you
forgive
everything
and
becoming
exalted
again
she
cried
you
must
love
me
you
must
love
me
very
much
now
because
i
shall
not
be
here
because
i
shall
die
perhaps
i
shall
be
dead
and
you
would
be
sorry
for
not
having
loved
me
for
not
having
pardoned
me
oh
yes
you
would
be
sorry
she
seemed
so
sure
of
dying
that
a
sudden
terror
froze
me
you
must
love
me
perhaps
you
do
not
believe
what
i
told
you
one
night
perhaps
you
do
not
believe
me
yet
but
you
will
surely
believe
me
when
i
am
gone
then
the
light
will
enter
your
soul
then
you
will
understand
the
truth
and
you
will
repent
not
having
loved
me
enough
not
having
forgiven
me
sobs
choked
her
utterance
do
you
know
why
i
m
sorry
to
die
because
i
die
without
your
knowing
how
much
i
have
loved
you
how
much
i
loved
you
oh
what
a
punishment
do
i
deserve
such
an
end
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
but
immediately
uncovered
it
and
very
pale
looked
at
me
an
idea
still
more
terrible
seemed
to
have
crushed
her
suppose
i
died
she
stammered
and
while
dying
hush
you
be
silent
juliana
i
was
more
affected
than
she
terror
had
overwhelmed
me
and
left
me
without
even
the
power
to
emit
a
single
word
of
consolation
to
combat
these
imaginations
of
death
with
a
single
vivifying
word
i
too
was
sure
of
the
atrocious
end
in
the
violet
darkness
my
eyes
met
juliana
s
and
on
that
poor
drawn
face
i
thought
i
noticed
symptoms
of
the
death
agony
symptoms
of
a
dissolution
that
had
already
begun
and
that
was
inevitable
she
could
not
repress
a
sort
of
shriek
that
resembled
nothing
human
and
she
clutched
my
arm
convulsively
help
me
tullio
help
me
she
clasped
me
hard
very
hard
yet
not
hard
enough
i
should
have
liked
to
feel
her
nails
penetrate
my
flesh
from
a
furious
desire
for
physical
torture
that
would
put
me
in
touch
with
her
torture
her
forehead
pressed
against
my
shoulder
she
continued
to
moan
its
note
was
that
which
renders
the
voice
unrecognizable
in
the
excess
of
corporeal
suffering
the
note
that
brings
suffering
man
to
the
level
of
the
suffering
instinctive
lamentation
of
all
flesh
in
pain
whether
animal
or
human
from
time
to
time
she
recovered
her
speech
sufficiently
to
repeat
help
me
and
she
imparted
to
me
the
violent
shocks
of
her
great
pain
a
flood
of
hate
mounted
from
the
deepest
roots
of
my
being
rose
even
to
my
hands
in
a
homicidal
impulse
that
impulse
came
before
its
time
but
the
vision
of
the
crime
already
consummated
lit
up
my
inner
consciousness
like
a
flash
you
shall
not
live
ah
tullio
tullio
suffocate
me
kill
me
i
can
not
stand
it
i
can
not
stand
it
you
hear
no
i
can
not
stand
it
i
do
not
want
to
suffer
any
longer
she
cried
savagely
looking
around
her
wildly
as
if
seeking
something
or
someone
from
whom
she
could
obtain
the
aid
i
was
powerless
to
render
her
calm
yourself
juliana
calm
yourself
perhaps
the
time
has
come
be
brave
take
this
chair
be
brave
my
dear
soul
a
little
more
patience
see
i
am
near
you
do
not
be
afraid
i
ran
to
the
bell
the
doctor
the
doctor
tell
him
to
come
immediately
juliana
ceased
her
lamentations
all
at
once
she
seemed
to
cease
suffering
or
at
least
to
be
unconscious
of
her
condition
in
the
abstraction
of
other
thoughts
it
was
evident
that
she
was
meditating
something
i
scarcely
had
time
to
remark
this
instantaneous
change
listen
tullio
suppose
i
become
delirious
what
do
you
mean
suppose
later
when
fever
sets
in
i
become
delirious
suppose
i
die
well
her
voice
had
such
accents
of
terror
her
reticences
were
so
sad
that
i
began
to
tremble
like
a
leaf
seized
by
a
sort
of
panic
still
without
understanding
what
she
meant
well
they
will
be
all
there
they
will
be
around
me
you
understand
you
understand
one
word
would
be
enough
one
never
knows
what
one
says
when
delirious
you
should
at
that
moment
my
mother
the
doctor
and
the
midwife
arrived
ah
doctor
sighed
juliana
i
thought
i
was
dying
nonsense
said
the
doctor
in
a
reassuring
voice
there
is
no
danger
everything
will
be
all
right
and
he
looked
at
me
your
husband
he
went
on
smiling
looks
worse
than
you
do
and
he
showed
me
the
door
saying
go
you
can
be
of
no
assistance
here
i
glanced
at
my
mother
s
eyes
she
seemed
restless
anxious
compassionate
yes
tullio
she
said
it
will
be
better
for
you
to
go
federico
is
downstairs
waiting
for
you
i
looked
at
juliana
without
concerning
herself
with
the
others
present
she
fixed
on
me
her
large
eyes
which
were
animated
with
an
extraordinary
brilliancy
they
expressed
all
the
passion
of
a
despairing
soul
i
will
not
leave
the
adjoining
room
i
declared
resolutely
without
removing
my
gaze
from
juliana
as
i
turned
to
go
out
i
noticed
the
midwife
disposing
the
pillows
on
the
bed
of
pain
on
the
bed
of
misery
and
i
shuddered
as
if
from
a
breath
of
death
it
was
between
four
and
five
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
pains
had
lasted
until
then
with
a
few
intermissions
of
relief
i
was
lying
on
the
lounge
in
the
adjoining
room
and
about
three
o
clock
sleep
had
overcome
me
unexpectedly
cristina
awoke
me
she
told
me
that
juliana
wished
to
see
me
my
eyes
still
heavy
from
sleep
i
started
to
my
feet
was
i
asleep
what
has
happened
do
not
be
alarmed
signor
nothing
has
happened
the
pains
are
easier
come
and
see
her
i
entered
and
my
eyes
immediately
sought
juliana
she
was
supported
by
pillows
pale
as
her
almost
lifeless
her
eyes
at
once
met
mine
because
they
were
turned
toward
the
door
in
the
expectation
of
my
coming
her
eyes
appeared
larger
deeper
hollower
surrounded
by
a
wider
dark
shadow
you
see
she
said
in
an
exhausted
voice
it
is
still
the
same
her
gaze
did
not
leave
me
her
eyes
spoke
like
those
of
the
princess
lisa
i
hoped
you
would
help
me
but
you
do
not
help
me
either
where
is
the
doctor
i
asked
my
mother
who
seemed
sad
and
preoccupied
she
pointed
to
a
door
i
opened
it
and
passed
through
i
saw
the
doctor
near
a
table
busy
with
his
preparations
well
i
asked
him
abruptly
how
is
it
nothing
serious
so
far
and
all
these
preparations
to
be
on
the
safe
side
but
how
long
will
it
last
it
is
nearly
over
please
speak
frankly
do
you
expect
any
complication
at
present
there
are
no
serious
symptoms
have
confidence
in
me
and
be
calm
i
have
noticed
that
your
presence
greatly
excites
your
wife
during
the
short
period
of
the
final
pains
she
needs
all
the
strength
she
has
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
you
go
away
promise
me
to
do
this
you
may
return
when
i
call
you
a
moan
reached
us
the
pains
are
beginning
again
he
said
the
crisis
has
come
so
be
calm
he
went
toward
the
door
i
followed
him
we
both
went
up
to
juliana
she
seized
my
arm
and
her
clutch
was
like
a
bite
had
she
so
much
strength
left
be
brave
be
brave
this
is
the
last
all
will
be
well
is
it
not
so
doctor
i
stammered
yes
yes
there
is
no
time
to
lose
let
your
husband
leave
the
room
signora
she
looked
at
the
doctor
and
me
with
dilated
eyes
she
released
my
arm
courage
i
repeated
choking
i
kissed
her
forehead
moist
with
perspiration
and
turned
to
leave
ah
tullio
she
cried
behind
me
that
cry
signified
i
shall
never
see
you
again
i
made
a
movement
as
if
about
to
return
to
her
leave
the
room
ordered
the
doctor
imperiously
i
obeyed
him
some
one
shut
the
door
behind
me
i
remained
several
minutes
outside
listening
but
my
knees
trembled
the
beating
of
my
heart
dominated
every
other
sound
i
threw
myself
on
the
sofa
put
my
handkerchief
between
my
teeth
buried
my
face
in
a
cushion
i
too
suffered
physical
torture
similar
to
what
an
amputation
slowly
and
badly
done
must
be
i
could
not
make
a
step
several
minutes
incalculable
time
thoughts
and
images
furrowed
my
brain
like
sudden
flashes
is
he
born
suppose
she
is
dead
suppose
they
are
both
dead
mother
and
child
no
no
it
is
certain
that
she
is
dead
and
that
he
lives
but
i
hear
no
wailing
why
i
conquered
the
terror
that
held
me
and
sprang
to
the
door
i
opened
it
and
entered
i
immediately
heard
the
doctor
s
voice
shouting
at
me
roughly
do
not
come
in
do
not
disturb
her
do
you
want
to
kill
her
juliana
looked
like
a
dead
woman
she
was
whiter
than
her
pillow
and
motionless
my
mother
bent
over
her
to
place
a
compress
in
position
the
doctor
calmly
and
methodically
was
preparing
an
internal
lotion
his
face
looked
anxious
but
his
hands
did
not
tremble
a
basin
of
boiling
water
was
steaming
in
a
corner
cristina
was
pouring
water
from
a
pitcher
into
a
second
basin
in
which
she
held
a
thermometer
another
woman
carried
into
an
adjoining
room
a
package
of
cotton
in
the
air
was
an
odor
of
ammonia
and
of
vinegar
the
slightest
details
of
that
scene
taken
in
at
one
glance
were
impressed
on
me
indelibly
fifty
degrees
mind
said
the
doctor
turning
toward
cristina
as
i
heard
no
wailing
i
looked
about
me
was
missing
in
the
room
where
s
the
baby
i
asked
trembling
he
s
there
in
the
other
room
replied
the
doctor
go
and
see
him
and
stay
there
i
pointed
to
juliana
with
a
gesture
of
despair
have
no
fear
hand
me
the
water
cristina
i
entered
the
other
room
my
ears
caught
a
feeble
wail
scarcely
perceptible
i
saw
on
a
layer
of
cotton
a
little
body
in
spots
and
whose
back
and
the
soles
of
the
feet
were
being
rubbed
by
the
midwife
s
dry
hands
come
here
signor
come
and
see
him
said
the
midwife
continuing
the
friction
come
and
see
what
a
fine
boy
he
is
he
did
not
breathe
at
first
but
now
all
danger
is
passed
look
at
the
fine
boy
she
turned
the
baby
round
putting
him
on
his
back
look
she
raised
the
baby
and
shook
him
up
and
down
the
wailing
became
a
little
stronger
but
in
my
eyes
was
a
strange
sparkle
that
prevented
me
from
seeing
well
in
all
my
being
i
felt
some
strange
obtuse
feeling
that
removed
from
me
the
exact
perception
of
all
these
real
and
coarse
things
look
repeated
the
midwife
again
replacing
the
wailing
child
on
the
cotton
he
was
crying
vigorously
now
he
breathed
he
lived
i
bent
over
that
little
palpitating
body
i
stooped
to
see
him
better
to
examine
him
to
recognize
the
odious
resemblance
but
the
little
face
still
somewhat
livid
with
protruding
eyeballs
swollen
mouth
wandering
deformed
visage
had
almost
nothing
human
about
it
and
inspired
me
with
nothing
but
disgust
he
wasn
t
breathing
when
he
was
born
did
you
say
i
stammered
no
signor
a
slight
apoplexy
she
spoke
without
any
intermission
of
the
cares
she
was
giving
the
infant
julia
give
me
the
linen
and
while
swathing
the
infant
she
added
there
is
nothing
to
fear
on
his
account
god
bless
him
her
expert
hands
took
hold
of
the
little
soft
head
as
if
to
mould
it
the
infant
s
wails
increased
in
strength
he
cried
louder
and
louder
as
if
to
prove
that
he
was
really
alive
as
if
to
provoke
me
and
exasperate
me
he
is
living
he
is
living
but
the
mother
abruptly
i
the
other
room
beside
myself
tullio
it
was
juliana
s
voice
as
feeble
as
that
of
a
dying
woman
the
patient
was
now
lying
on
her
bed
in
the
alcove
it
was
broad
daylight
i
was
seated
at
her
bedside
i
looked
at
her
silently
sorrowfully
she
was
not
asleep
but
extreme
weakness
prevented
all
movement
removed
all
expression
of
life
made
her
seem
inanimate
i
made
an
instinctive
movement
to
touch
her
because
i
thought
she
had
become
cold
as
ice
but
i
was
restrained
by
the
fear
of
disturbing
her
more
than
once
during
my
continuous
contemplation
beneath
the
shock
of
some
sudden
fear
i
made
a
movement
to
rise
and
fetch
the
doctor
as
i
meditated
i
rolled
between
my
fingers
a
little
tuft
of
cotton
which
i
carefully
picked
apart
and
from
time
to
time
impelled
by
an
invincible
restlessness
i
placed
it
with
infinite
precautions
near
juliana
s
lips
the
waving
of
the
threads
showed
me
the
strength
of
her
respiration
she
was
stretched
on
her
back
and
a
low
pillow
supported
her
head
in
the
frame
formed
by
her
chestnut
hair
which
was
loosely
caught
up
the
lines
of
her
face
seemed
more
refined
than
usual
showed
more
perfectly
the
waxy
tones
her
was
fastened
at
the
neck
and
tight
at
her
wrists
and
her
hands
lay
flat
on
the
cover
so
white
that
they
were
only
distinguished
from
the
linen
by
the
azure
of
their
veins
a
supernatural
goodness
emanated
from
this
poor
creature
so
pallid
and
goodness
that
penetrated
all
my
being
that
filled
my
heart
and
one
would
have
thought
that
she
was
still
repeating
what
have
you
done
to
me
her
colorless
mouth
with
its
depressed
angles
revealing
a
mortal
lassitude
that
arid
mouth
twisted
by
so
many
convulsions
martyrized
by
so
many
cries
seemed
constantly
repeating
what
have
you
done
to
me
i
examined
the
emaciation
of
her
body
that
scarcely
formed
a
relief
on
the
surface
of
the
bed
since
the
event
had
taken
place
since
finally
the
had
been
separated
from
her
life
forever
i
no
longer
felt
rise
in
me
the
least
instinctive
movement
of
repulsion
not
the
least
sudden
shade
of
anger
nothing
that
could
affect
my
tenderness
and
pity
i
no
longer
felt
on
seeing
her
anything
but
an
effusion
of
immense
tenderness
and
pity
for
the
best
and
most
unfortunate
of
human
creatures
all
my
soul
now
hung
on
those
poor
lips
which
from
one
moment
to
another
might
render
up
their
last
sigh
as
i
looked
at
her
pale
face
i
thought
with
profound
sincerity
how
happy
i
should
be
could
i
transfuse
half
of
my
own
blood
into
her
veins
i
heard
the
light
ticking
of
a
clock
placed
on
the
i
felt
that
fugitive
time
was
slipping
by
and
i
thought
he
is
alive
the
flight
of
time
caused
me
singular
anxiety
very
different
from
that
which
i
had
felt
on
other
i
thought
he
lives
and
has
a
tenacious
hold
on
life
at
the
time
of
his
birth
he
was
not
breathing
when
i
saw
him
he
still
had
the
signs
of
asphyxia
all
over
his
body
if
the
care
of
the
midwife
had
not
saved
him
he
would
be
now
nothing
but
a
little
livid
cadaver
a
harmless
negligible
and
perhaps
forgettable
thing
i
should
only
have
juliana
s
cure
to
think
of
and
i
would
not
leave
this
room
again
i
would
be
the
most
assiduous
and
most
gentle
of
nurses
i
would
succeed
in
realizing
the
transfusion
of
life
in
accomplishing
the
miracle
by
the
power
of
love
it
would
be
impossible
for
her
not
to
get
well
she
would
resuscitate
gradually
be
regenerated
with
new
blood
she
would
appear
a
new
creature
freed
from
all
impurity
we
would
both
feel
purified
worthy
of
each
other
after
so
long
and
so
painful
an
expiation
the
illness
the
convalescence
would
relegate
the
sad
memories
to
an
indefinite
distance
and
i
would
try
to
efface
from
her
soul
even
the
shadow
of
remembrance
i
would
try
to
procure
for
her
perfect
oblivion
in
love
after
this
great
trial
every
other
human
love
would
seem
frivolous
by
comparison
with
ours
i
exalted
myself
in
the
almost
mystic
splendor
of
this
dream
of
the
future
whilst
beneath
my
fixed
gaze
juliana
s
visage
took
on
a
sort
of
immateriality
an
expression
of
supernatural
goodness
as
if
she
were
already
removed
from
the
world
as
if
the
presence
of
death
had
left
behind
in
her
being
only
a
pure
spiritual
essence
the
mute
question
no
longer
struck
me
like
a
wound
no
longer
seemed
terrifying
to
me
what
have
you
done
to
me
i
replied
have
you
not
become
through
my
instrumentality
sister
of
has
not
suffering
elevated
your
soul
to
a
vertiginous
height
from
which
it
has
been
given
you
to
see
the
world
in
an
extraordinary
light
do
you
not
owe
to
me
the
revelation
of
the
supreme
truth
what
matters
our
errors
our
falls
our
sins
if
we
have
succeeded
in
tearing
the
veil
from
our
eyes
if
we
have
succeeded
in
setting
at
liberty
what
there
is
lowest
in
our
miserable
substance
we
will
obtain
the
highest
joy
to
which
the
elect
of
earth
can
consciousness
of
a
i
became
exalted
the
alcove
was
silent
the
darkness
full
of
mystery
juliana
s
face
acquired
for
me
a
superhuman
aspect
and
there
was
a
solemnity
in
my
contemplation
for
i
felt
in
the
air
the
presence
of
invisible
death
all
my
soul
was
suspended
on
those
pallid
lips
which
from
one
moment
to
another
might
render
their
last
breath
and
those
lips
were
contracted
emitted
a
groan
the
painful
contraction
changed
the
lines
of
the
face
persisted
for
several
moments
the
wrinkles
in
the
forehead
deepened
the
skin
of
the
eyelids
trembled
lightly
a
white
line
appeared
between
the
lashes
i
bent
over
the
invalid
she
opened
her
eyes
and
immediately
closed
them
she
did
not
appear
to
see
me
her
eyes
showed
no
sign
of
recognition
one
would
have
thought
she
was
blind
had
an
anemic
amaurosis
supervened
had
she
been
suddenly
struck
by
blindness
i
heard
some
one
enter
the
room
god
grant
it
is
the
doctor
i
left
the
alcove
and
saw
the
doctor
my
mother
and
the
midwife
who
had
entered
quietly
cristina
followed
them
is
she
quiet
inquired
the
doctor
in
a
low
voice
she
s
moaning
who
knows
what
she
is
still
suffering
has
she
spoken
no
she
must
not
be
disturbed
in
the
least
remember
that
just
now
she
opened
her
eyes
for
a
moment
she
did
not
seem
to
see
anything
the
doctor
entered
the
alcove
after
having
made
a
sign
for
us
to
remain
where
we
were
my
mother
said
to
me
come
it
is
time
to
renew
the
compresses
come
quickly
let
us
go
and
see
little
raymond
federico
is
downstairs
she
took
my
hand
i
let
myself
be
led
he
has
fallen
asleep
she
continued
he
sleeps
quietly
the
will
arrive
this
evening
however
sad
and
anxious
she
was
when
speaking
of
juliana
she
had
a
smile
in
her
eyes
when
speaking
of
the
infant
her
entire
face
was
lit
up
by
tenderness
by
the
doctor
s
orders
a
room
distant
from
that
occupied
by
the
invalid
had
been
selected
for
large
airy
room
containing
a
thousand
souvenirs
of
our
childhood
directly
i
entered
i
saw
federico
maria
and
natalia
grouped
around
the
cradle
and
attentively
contemplating
the
little
sleeper
federico
turned
and
asked
how
is
juliana
bad
isn
t
she
resting
she
is
suffering
in
spite
of
myself
i
answered
almost
harshly
a
sort
of
aridity
had
suddenly
invaded
my
soul
my
only
sensation
was
an
indomitable
aversion
against
the
intruder
an
impatience
of
the
torture
which
people
inflicted
on
me
without
knowing
it
in
spite
of
my
efforts
i
could
not
feint
thus
we
were
all
around
the
my
mother
federico
maria
and
raymond
s
slumber
he
was
bound
in
the
and
his
head
was
covered
with
a
cap
trimmed
with
laces
and
ribbons
his
face
appeared
less
swollen
but
still
red
and
the
cheeks
shone
like
the
skin
of
a
wound
recently
healed
a
little
saliva
rolled
from
the
corners
of
the
closed
mouth
the
eyelids
without
lashes
puffed
up
at
the
edges
covered
the
projecting
eyeballs
the
root
of
the
nose
yet
formless
was
marked
by
a
bruise
whom
does
he
resemble
said
my
mother
i
can
not
find
any
resemblance
he
is
too
young
said
federico
we
must
wait
a
few
days
two
or
three
times
my
mother
looked
at
me
and
then
looked
at
the
infant
as
if
to
compare
the
faces
no
she
said
i
think
he
resembles
juliana
most
at
present
i
interrupted
he
resembles
no
one
he
is
horrible
horrible
how
can
you
say
so
he
is
perfectly
beautiful
look
at
that
mass
of
hair
with
her
fingers
she
gently
raised
the
cap
disclosing
the
still
soft
skull
on
which
were
seen
several
brown
hairs
let
me
touch
them
grandmamma
begged
maria
stretching
out
her
hand
toward
her
brother
s
head
no
no
do
you
wish
to
wake
him
the
skull
had
the
appearance
of
wax
somewhat
softened
by
heat
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
slightest
touch
would
leave
a
mark
on
it
my
mother
covered
it
again
and
then
bent
over
to
kiss
the
forehead
with
infinite
gentleness
me
too
grandmother
begged
maria
yes
but
gently
the
cradle
was
too
high
lift
me
said
maria
to
federico
federico
raised
her
up
in
his
arms
and
i
saw
the
beautiful
rosy
mouth
of
my
daughter
get
ready
to
kiss
before
she
succeeded
in
touching
the
forehead
i
saw
her
long
locks
play
on
the
whiteness
of
the
clothes
federico
looked
at
me
but
i
did
not
smile
me
too
me
too
natalia
now
clung
to
the
edge
of
the
cradle
gently
federico
raised
her
too
and
again
i
saw
the
long
locks
play
on
the
whiteness
of
the
bed
linen
in
the
movement
she
made
in
bending
over
this
spectacle
had
petrified
me
and
my
look
certainly
expressed
my
emotion
these
kisses
from
lips
so
dear
to
me
had
not
removed
from
the
intruder
his
repugnant
aspect
they
had
on
the
contrary
rendered
him
more
odious
to
me
i
felt
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
touch
that
strange
flesh
to
make
any
gesture
resembling
paternal
love
my
mother
observed
me
with
uneasiness
you
do
not
kiss
him
she
asked
no
mother
no
he
has
done
too
much
harm
to
juliana
i
can
not
forgive
him
i
recoiled
with
an
instinctive
movement
a
movement
of
manifest
disgust
my
mother
remained
for
a
moment
stupefied
speechless
what
are
you
saying
tullio
is
it
this
poor
baby
s
fault
be
just
assuredly
my
mother
had
remarked
the
sincerity
of
my
aversion
i
could
not
succeed
in
restraining
myself
all
my
nerves
rebelled
impossible
now
impossible
let
me
be
mother
it
will
pass
my
tone
was
resolute
i
trembled
all
over
there
was
a
lump
in
my
throat
the
muscles
of
my
face
contracted
after
so
many
hours
of
violent
tension
my
entire
being
required
relaxation
i
believe
that
a
great
burst
of
sobs
would
have
done
me
good
but
the
lump
in
my
throat
was
too
firm
you
grieve
me
greatly
tullio
said
my
mother
so
you
exact
that
i
kiss
him
i
burst
out
beside
myself
and
i
approached
the
cradle
bent
over
the
infant
and
kissed
him
the
child
awoke
he
began
to
wail
feebly
at
first
then
with
increasing
fury
i
observed
that
the
skin
of
his
face
took
on
a
more
reddish
tint
and
wrinkled
beneath
the
effort
while
his
whitish
tongue
trembled
in
his
mouth
although
i
was
at
the
height
of
exasperation
i
recognized
the
error
committed
i
felt
the
gaze
of
federico
maria
and
natalia
fixed
upon
me
forgive
me
mother
i
stammered
i
no
longer
know
what
i
am
doing
i
am
not
in
my
right
senses
forgive
me
she
had
taken
the
infant
from
the
cradle
and
held
it
in
her
arms
without
succeeding
in
quieting
it
the
wails
went
through
me
overwhelmed
me
let
us
go
out
federico
i
left
hastily
federico
followed
me
juliana
is
very
ill
i
can
not
understand
how
any
one
can
think
of
anything
else
but
her
now
i
said
as
if
to
justify
myself
you
have
not
seen
her
she
looks
as
if
she
were
dying
for
several
days
juliana
hovered
between
life
and
death
her
weakness
was
so
great
that
the
slightest
effort
was
followed
by
exhaustion
she
was
compelled
to
remain
constantly
on
her
back
without
the
slightest
movement
the
least
attempt
to
raise
herself
provoked
symptoms
of
cerebral
anemia
nothing
could
be
found
to
overcome
the
nauseas
that
seized
her
to
lift
the
weight
that
crushed
down
on
her
chest
to
remove
the
buzzing
that
she
heard
without
cease
i
remained
day
and
night
at
her
bedside
always
on
the
watch
sustained
by
an
indefatigable
energy
that
surprised
even
myself
i
employed
all
the
strength
of
my
own
life
in
sustaining
that
life
which
was
threatened
with
extinction
it
seemed
to
me
that
from
the
other
side
of
the
bed
death
was
watching
ready
to
profit
by
an
opportune
moment
to
ravish
his
prey
at
times
i
had
the
real
sensation
that
i
was
becoming
transfused
in
the
debilitated
body
of
the
invalid
that
i
communicated
to
her
a
little
of
my
strength
that
i
imparted
an
impulse
to
her
exhausted
heart
never
did
the
miseries
of
illness
inspire
in
me
the
least
repugnance
the
slightest
disgust
never
did
any
material
object
offend
the
delicacy
of
my
senses
my
senses
overexcited
were
attentive
only
in
perceiving
the
least
changes
in
the
condition
of
the
invalid
before
she
spoke
a
word
before
she
made
a
sign
i
divined
her
desires
her
wants
the
degree
of
her
suffering
by
divination
without
the
physician
having
to
make
any
suggestion
i
had
succeeded
in
being
able
to
discover
new
and
ingenious
means
of
relieving
one
of
her
pains
of
calming
one
of
her
attacks
i
alone
could
persuade
her
to
eat
and
to
sleep
i
resorted
to
every
stratagem
to
prayers
and
caresses
to
make
her
swallow
her
medicine
i
pressed
her
so
much
that
finally
incapable
of
further
resistance
she
had
to
submit
to
a
salutary
effort
to
triumph
over
the
nausea
and
there
was
nothing
sweeter
to
me
than
the
imperceptible
smile
with
which
she
submitted
to
my
will
her
slightest
acts
of
obedience
put
my
heart
into
a
profound
commotion
when
she
said
in
her
feeble
voice
is
this
right
am
i
good
i
felt
my
throat
choke
my
eyes
become
veiled
she
often
complained
of
a
painful
and
incessant
throbbing
at
the
temples
then
i
would
pass
my
over
her
brow
to
appease
the
pain
i
caressed
her
hair
very
softly
to
lull
her
to
sleep
when
i
perceived
that
she
was
asleep
her
respiration
gave
me
the
illusory
sensation
that
i
was
solaced
as
if
the
benefit
of
the
slumber
were
extended
even
to
me
in
presence
of
this
slumber
i
felt
a
sort
of
religious
emotion
i
was
invaded
by
a
vague
fervor
i
felt
a
desire
to
believe
in
the
existence
of
some
superior
being
omnispective
omnipotent
in
order
to
address
my
prayers
to
him
there
arose
spontaneously
from
the
depths
of
my
soul
the
preludes
of
prayer
according
to
the
christian
formula
sometimes
the
inner
eloquence
exalted
me
even
to
the
summit
of
the
true
faith
within
me
there
awoke
all
the
mystic
tendencies
transmitted
to
me
by
a
long
line
of
catholic
ancestors
while
my
inner
orisons
were
unfolding
i
contemplated
the
sleeper
she
was
still
as
pale
as
her
the
transparency
of
her
skin
would
have
enabled
me
to
count
the
veins
on
her
cheeks
on
her
chin
on
her
neck
i
watched
her
as
if
i
had
had
the
hope
of
seeing
the
beneficial
effects
of
that
repose
the
slow
diffusion
of
new
blood
engendered
by
the
nourishment
the
first
premonitory
signs
of
cure
i
would
have
liked
by
some
supernatural
faculty
to
be
present
at
the
mysterious
restorative
elaboration
which
was
taking
place
in
that
enfeebled
body
and
i
persisted
in
hoping
when
she
awakes
she
will
feel
stronger
she
seemed
to
feel
a
great
relief
when
she
held
my
hand
in
her
own
icy
hands
sometimes
she
took
my
hand
and
put
it
on
the
pillow
pressed
her
cheek
against
it
with
a
childlike
gesture
and
gradually
dozed
off
in
that
position
so
as
not
to
awaken
her
i
exerted
all
my
strength
to
keep
for
a
long
long
time
my
arm
in
this
one
position
which
was
torture
once
she
said
why
don
t
you
sleep
here
with
me
you
never
sleep
and
she
forced
me
to
lay
my
head
on
her
pillow
let
us
go
to
sleep
i
pretended
i
was
going
to
sleep
to
set
her
a
good
example
but
when
i
opened
my
eyes
i
encountered
hers
wide
open
and
fixed
on
me
well
i
cried
what
are
you
doing
and
you
she
replied
in
her
eyes
there
was
an
expression
of
such
tender
goodness
that
i
felt
my
heart
melt
i
extended
my
mouth
and
kissed
her
eyelids
she
wished
to
kiss
me
the
same
way
then
she
repeated
let
us
go
to
sleep
now
thus
a
veil
of
oblivion
sometimes
descended
over
our
misfortune
often
her
poor
feet
were
frozen
i
felt
them
beneath
the
covers
and
they
seemed
to
me
like
marble
she
herself
said
they
are
dead
they
were
so
emaciated
and
so
small
that
i
could
almost
hold
them
in
my
hand
they
inspired
me
with
a
great
pity
i
warmed
some
linen
at
the
fire
to
put
on
them
and
did
not
tire
of
giving
them
attention
i
would
have
liked
to
warm
them
with
my
breath
to
cover
them
with
kisses
with
this
new
pity
there
mingled
the
distant
recollections
of
of
the
happy
time
when
by
a
habit
that
almost
resembled
a
vow
i
reserved
for
myself
exclusively
the
privilege
of
putting
on
her
shoes
in
the
morning
and
taking
them
off
at
night
with
my
own
hands
while
on
my
knees
before
her
one
day
after
long
vigils
i
was
so
fatigued
that
an
irresistible
slumber
seized
me
just
at
the
moment
when
i
had
my
hands
beneath
the
cover
holding
the
little
dead
feet
in
the
warm
cloth
my
head
sank
forward
and
i
went
to
sleep
in
that
attitude
when
i
awoke
i
saw
my
mother
my
brother
and
the
doctor
who
were
smiling
i
was
embarrassed
poor
boy
he
is
tired
out
said
my
mother
stroking
my
hair
with
one
of
her
most
tender
gestures
juliana
said
take
him
away
mother
take
him
away
federico
no
no
i
am
not
tired
i
repeated
i
am
not
tired
the
doctor
announced
his
departure
he
declared
that
the
invalid
was
out
of
danger
and
on
the
road
to
recovery
but
it
was
necessary
by
all
means
possible
to
continue
to
excite
the
regeneration
of
blood
his
colleague
jemma
de
tussi
with
whom
he
had
consulted
and
found
of
the
same
opinion
would
continue
the
same
treatment
he
had
less
confidence
in
remedies
than
in
the
rigorous
observation
of
the
various
hygienic
rules
and
of
diet
that
he
had
prescribed
in
truth
he
added
pointing
to
me
i
could
not
wish
for
a
more
intelligent
more
vigilant
or
more
devoted
nurse
he
has
done
miracles
and
he
will
do
more
i
shall
go
away
perfectly
easy
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
heart
leaped
into
my
throat
and
was
suffocating
me
the
unexpected
praise
of
that
serious
man
in
my
mother
s
and
brother
s
presence
caused
me
profound
emotion
it
was
an
extraordinary
reward
for
me
i
looked
at
juliana
and
i
saw
that
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
beneath
my
look
she
burst
out
all
at
once
into
sobs
i
made
a
superhuman
effort
to
contain
myself
but
could
not
succeed
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
soul
was
melted
in
my
bosom
i
felt
all
the
virtues
in
the
world
collected
together
in
that
unforgettable
hour
juliana
regained
strength
day
by
day
but
slowly
my
assiduity
did
not
wane
i
even
took
advantage
of
the
remarks
made
by
vebesti
to
redouble
my
vigilance
to
permit
no
one
to
replace
me
to
oppose
my
mother
and
brother
who
advised
me
to
rest
my
body
from
now
on
became
accustomed
to
the
severe
discipline
and
scarcely
ever
felt
fatigue
my
entire
life
was
enclosed
between
the
walls
of
that
room
in
the
intimacy
of
that
alcove
in
the
circle
where
the
invalid
breathed
as
she
required
absolute
quiet
as
she
was
ordered
to
speak
little
so
as
to
avoid
fatigue
i
exercised
my
ingenuity
in
keeping
from
her
bedside
even
the
members
of
her
family
the
alcove
remained
therefore
isolated
from
the
rest
of
the
house
for
hours
and
hours
and
alone
and
crushed
as
she
was
by
her
illness
attentive
as
i
was
in
my
pious
duty
we
were
at
times
able
to
forget
our
misfortune
to
lose
the
sense
of
reality
to
retain
no
other
consciousness
but
that
of
our
immense
love
at
times
it
seemed
to
me
that
beyond
the
curtains
nothing
existed
any
longer
so
great
was
the
concentration
of
my
entire
being
on
the
invalid
nothing
occurred
to
recall
the
frightful
thing
to
me
i
saw
before
me
a
suffering
sister
and
my
sole
care
was
to
relieve
her
pain
too
often
these
veils
of
forgetfulness
were
brutally
rent
asunder
my
mother
spoke
of
raymond
the
curtains
opened
to
give
passage
to
the
intruder
my
mother
carried
him
in
her
arms
i
was
present
and
i
felt
that
i
must
have
become
pale
as
all
my
blood
flowed
back
to
my
heart
and
juliana
what
sensation
did
she
feel
i
looked
at
that
reddish
face
the
size
of
a
man
s
fist
half
hidden
by
the
bonnet
trimmings
and
with
a
fierce
aversion
that
annihilated
every
other
emotion
in
my
soul
i
thought
what
shall
i
do
to
deliver
myself
of
you
why
were
you
not
born
dead
my
hate
was
boundless
it
was
instinctive
blind
might
say
carnal
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
had
its
seat
in
my
flesh
that
it
surged
through
all
my
fibres
through
all
my
nerves
through
all
my
veins
nothing
could
conquer
it
nothing
could
destroy
it
it
sufficed
that
the
intruder
were
present
at
no
matter
what
hour
no
matter
under
what
circumstances
for
there
to
be
immediately
induced
in
me
a
sort
of
annihilating
rage
for
me
to
fall
beneath
the
empire
of
a
single
and
unique
passion
my
hate
against
him
my
mother
said
to
juliana
look
how
he
has
already
changed
in
a
few
days
he
resembles
you
more
than
tullio
but
he
bears
very
little
resemblance
to
either
of
you
he
is
still
too
little
we
shall
see
later
do
you
want
to
kiss
him
she
put
the
child
s
forehead
to
the
invalid
s
lips
what
sensation
did
juliana
feel
the
infant
began
to
cry
i
had
the
courage
to
say
to
my
mother
without
bitterness
take
him
away
please
juliana
needs
quiet
and
these
shocks
do
her
great
harm
my
mother
left
the
alcove
the
wails
died
away
but
continued
to
cause
me
the
same
sensation
of
painful
laceration
the
same
desire
to
run
and
strangle
him
so
as
not
to
hear
them
we
heard
them
for
some
time
while
he
was
being
carried
away
when
they
finally
ceased
the
silence
seemed
horrible
to
me
it
fell
on
me
like
an
avalanche
it
crushed
me
but
instead
of
dwelling
on
my
pain
i
thought
immediately
that
juliana
required
assistance
ah
tullio
tullio
it
is
not
possible
be
silent
juliana
be
silent
if
you
love
me
i
beseech
you
be
silent
my
voice
my
gesture
was
supplicating
all
the
irritation
of
my
hate
had
fallen
i
suffered
only
on
account
of
her
suffering
i
feared
only
the
distress
caused
the
invalid
the
shock
she
had
received
from
that
fragile
life
if
you
love
me
you
must
think
of
nothing
but
your
cure
look
at
me
i
think
only
of
you
i
suffer
only
for
you
you
must
not
torment
yourself
you
must
abandon
yourself
entirely
to
my
tenderness
in
order
to
get
well
in
her
feeble
and
trembling
voice
she
answered
but
who
knows
what
you
secretly
feel
in
your
heart
poor
soul
no
no
juliana
do
not
torment
yourself
i
suffer
only
for
you
and
because
i
see
you
suffer
i
forget
all
when
i
see
you
smile
when
you
feel
well
i
am
happy
you
must
get
well
therefore
if
you
love
me
you
must
be
quiet
obedient
patient
when
you
are
well
when
you
are
stronger
then
god
is
good
she
murmured
my
god
have
pity
on
us
in
what
manner
i
thought
in
causing
the
intruder
to
die
so
then
we
both
wished
his
death
the
mother
herself
saw
no
other
alternative
than
the
destruction
of
her
child
yes
that
was
the
only
alternative
and
my
memory
recalled
the
brief
dialogue
that
on
one
now
distant
evening
we
had
had
beneath
the
elms
it
recalled
the
painful
confession
but
does
she
still
hate
him
now
he
is
born
can
she
feel
a
sincere
aversion
against
the
flesh
of
her
flesh
does
she
pray
god
sincerely
to
take
from
her
the
fruit
of
her
own
entrails
i
again
recalled
the
wild
hope
that
i
had
conceived
as
if
in
a
flash
on
the
tragic
night
suppose
the
idea
of
crime
should
occur
to
her
and
gradually
become
strong
enough
to
influence
her
and
i
looked
at
her
hands
stretched
out
on
the
cloth
so
pale
that
they
were
distinguishable
from
the
sheets
only
by
the
azure
of
their
veins
now
that
the
invalid
s
condition
was
improving
daily
a
strange
sorrow
oppressed
me
at
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
did
not
see
the
sad
days
of
the
alcove
pass
by
without
a
vague
regret
those
mornings
those
evenings
those
nights
however
desolate
they
were
had
their
grave
sweetness
every
day
my
labor
of
charity
seemed
more
beautiful
an
abundance
of
love
inundated
my
soul
and
submerged
at
times
my
sombre
thoughts
procured
for
me
at
times
forgetfulness
of
the
frightful
thing
awoke
in
me
some
consolatory
illusion
some
indefinite
dream
shut
up
in
that
alcove
i
felt
at
times
a
sensation
similar
to
that
felt
in
the
shadows
of
lonely
chapels
i
felt
as
if
in
a
refuge
from
the
violences
of
life
from
opportunities
for
sinning
at
times
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
light
curtains
separated
me
from
an
abyss
i
was
assailed
by
sudden
and
unknown
fears
around
me
in
the
night
i
heard
the
silence
of
the
entire
house
and
with
the
eyes
of
my
soul
i
saw
in
the
corner
of
a
distant
room
by
the
side
of
a
lighted
lamp
the
cradle
in
which
slept
the
intruder
my
mother
s
heir
a
great
shudder
of
horror
ran
through
me
and
i
remained
for
a
long
time
influenced
by
fright
under
the
sinister
light
of
this
single
thought
the
curtains
separated
me
from
an
abyss
but
now
that
juliana
s
condition
improved
daily
excuses
failed
me
for
prolonging
her
isolation
and
by
degrees
the
routine
of
domestic
life
invaded
the
peaceful
room
my
mother
my
brother
maria
natalia
miss
edith
entered
more
frequently
remained
longer
raymond
imposed
himself
upon
the
maternal
tenderness
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
avoid
it
either
for
juliana
or
for
me
we
had
to
be
lavish
with
kisses
and
smiles
we
had
to
feint
and
artfully
dissimulate
to
endure
the
refined
cruelties
that
chance
brought
to
us
to
be
tortured
by
slow
fire
nourished
with
healthy
and
substantial
milk
surrounded
by
infinite
care
raymond
gradually
lost
his
first
repulsive
appearance
and
commenced
to
grow
he
grew
whiter
acquired
a
more
clearly
defined
form
and
now
kept
his
gray
eyes
wide
open
but
all
his
movements
were
odious
to
me
from
the
sucking
of
his
lips
when
applied
to
the
breast
to
the
uncertain
movements
of
his
little
hands
i
could
never
discover
anything
attractive
in
him
i
never
had
a
thought
of
him
that
was
not
hateful
when
i
was
obliged
to
touch
him
when
my
mother
brought
him
to
me
for
a
kiss
there
ran
over
my
entire
skin
the
same
thrill
of
horror
which
contact
with
an
unclean
animal
would
have
caused
me
every
fibre
in
me
revolted
and
the
violence
that
i
did
myself
threw
me
into
despair
every
day
brought
its
new
torture
and
my
mother
was
my
grand
inquisitor
once
on
unexpectedly
entering
the
room
and
parting
the
curtains
of
the
alcove
i
perceived
the
infant
lying
on
the
bed
by
juliana
s
side
nobody
was
present
we
three
were
there
together
without
witnesses
the
infant
slept
peacefully
bound
up
in
its
it
was
mother
who
left
him
here
stammered
juliana
i
fled
like
a
madman
another
time
cristina
called
me
i
followed
her
into
the
room
containing
the
cradle
my
mother
was
there
with
the
baby
on
her
knees
the
child
was
moving
its
limbs
and
arms
turning
its
eyes
from
one
side
to
the
other
burying
its
fingers
in
its
gaping
mouth
at
the
wrists
at
the
ankles
behind
the
knees
on
the
lower
abdomen
the
flesh
swelled
out
in
little
cushions
and
was
covered
with
rice
powder
my
mother
s
hands
caressed
the
little
members
with
delight
pointing
out
to
me
every
detail
expatiating
on
the
skin
which
a
recent
bath
had
polished
and
made
lustrous
the
infant
seemed
to
be
enjoying
it
feel
here
feel
how
solid
he
is
already
she
said
inviting
me
to
touch
him
i
was
obliged
to
touch
him
see
how
heavy
he
is
i
was
obliged
to
lift
him
to
feel
that
warm
and
flaccid
little
body
palpitate
between
my
hands
which
were
seized
by
a
trembling
that
was
not
due
to
tenderness
the
love
the
love
the
love
of
his
grandmother
repeated
my
mother
tickling
the
chin
of
the
infant
who
did
not
yet
know
how
to
laugh
the
dear
gray
head
that
had
already
bent
over
two
blessed
cradles
before
for
the
same
caresses
and
much
whiter
now
bent
unconsciously
over
another
s
child
over
the
intruder
i
imagined
that
she
had
not
shown
herself
as
tender
toward
maria
toward
natalia
toward
the
true
creatures
of
my
blood
she
wished
to
swathe
him
herself
she
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
the
abdomen
but
you
are
not
yet
a
christian
and
turning
toward
me
she
said
the
time
has
come
to
fix
the
baptismal
day
jemma
chevalier
of
the
holy
sepulchre
of
jerusalem
a
handsome
cheerful
old
man
brought
a
bouquet
of
white
chrysanthemums
as
an
offering
to
juliana
oh
my
favorite
flowers
said
juliana
thank
you
she
took
the
bouquet
gazed
on
it
for
a
long
time
buried
her
tapering
fingers
in
it
and
there
was
a
sad
analogy
between
her
pallor
and
that
of
the
autumn
flowers
they
were
chrysanthemums
as
large
as
roses
tufted
heavy
they
had
the
color
of
a
sickly
bloodless
almost
lifeless
skin
the
livid
whiteness
noticeable
on
the
cheeks
of
beggars
benumbed
by
cold
a
few
were
imperceptibly
veined
with
violet
others
were
slightly
tinged
with
yellow
with
exquisite
tones
take
them
she
said
to
me
put
them
in
water
it
was
in
the
morning
it
was
in
november
we
had
just
passed
the
anniversary
of
the
fatal
day
which
these
flowers
recalled
sans
eurydice
while
i
was
putting
the
white
chrysanthemums
into
a
vase
the
air
from
orpheus
sang
in
my
memory
there
reappeared
in
my
mind
certain
fragments
of
the
singular
scene
that
had
taken
place
the
year
previous
and
i
saw
juliana
again
in
that
warm
and
golden
light
in
that
suave
perfume
in
the
midst
of
all
those
objects
bearing
the
imprint
of
feminine
grace
to
which
the
phantom
of
the
ancient
melody
seemed
to
impart
the
palpitation
of
a
secret
life
to
spread
the
shadow
of
i
know
not
what
mystery
had
not
these
flowers
awakened
in
her
also
some
remembrance
a
mortal
sorrow
weighed
on
my
sorrow
of
an
inconsolable
lover
the
other
presented
himself
before
me
and
his
eyes
were
as
gray
as
those
of
the
intruder
the
doctor
said
to
me
from
the
alcove
you
may
open
the
window
it
is
well
to
have
the
room
well
aired
to
have
plenty
of
sunlight
enter
oh
yes
yes
open
it
cried
the
invalid
i
opened
it
at
this
moment
my
mother
entered
together
with
the
who
had
raymond
in
her
arms
i
remained
between
the
curtains
and
leaned
against
the
balustrade
and
looked
out
on
the
landscape
behind
me
i
heard
the
familiar
voices
we
had
arrived
at
the
end
of
november
already
the
summer
of
the
dead
had
passed
a
great
vacuous
light
extended
over
the
humid
country
over
the
noble
and
peaceful
profile
of
the
hillsides
it
seemed
that
through
the
confused
tops
of
the
olive
plants
a
silvery
vapor
was
circulating
here
and
there
several
threads
of
smoke
whitened
in
the
sun
the
breeze
bore
at
intervals
the
light
rustling
of
falling
leaves
the
rest
was
only
peace
and
silence
why
i
thought
did
she
sing
that
morning
why
on
hearing
her
did
i
feel
so
agitated
she
seemed
to
me
another
woman
was
she
then
in
love
with
him
to
what
condition
of
her
soul
did
that
unusual
effusion
correspond
she
sang
because
she
loved
perhaps
i
am
mistaken
but
i
shall
never
know
the
truth
it
was
no
longer
the
jealous
agitation
of
the
senses
but
a
more
noble
affliction
that
arose
from
the
depths
of
my
soul
i
thought
what
remembrance
has
she
retained
of
him
has
that
remembrance
often
tormented
her
the
son
is
a
living
bond
she
finds
in
raymond
something
of
the
man
to
whom
she
has
belonged
she
will
find
more
precise
resemblances
it
is
impossible
that
she
should
forget
raymond
s
father
and
perhaps
she
has
him
constantly
before
her
eyes
what
would
she
feel
if
she
knew
he
were
doomed
and
i
stopped
to
imagine
the
progress
of
the
paralysis
and
to
form
an
inner
picture
of
that
man
s
condition
based
on
that
furnished
me
by
the
recollection
of
poor
spinelli
i
saw
him
once
more
seated
in
his
large
red
leather
armchair
of
a
clayey
pallor
with
every
line
of
his
visage
drawn
his
mouth
distorted
and
gaping
full
of
saliva
and
stammering
incomprehensibly
i
once
more
saw
the
gesture
he
made
every
moment
to
gather
in
his
handkerchief
that
saliva
which
rolled
down
the
corners
of
his
mouth
tullio
it
was
my
mother
s
voice
i
turned
and
walked
toward
the
alcove
juliana
lay
on
her
back
dejected
and
silent
it
s
all
arranged
the
baptism
takes
place
the
day
after
said
my
mother
the
doctor
believes
that
juliana
must
remain
in
bed
for
some
time
yet
how
do
you
think
she
is
doctor
i
asked
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
a
slight
pause
in
her
progress
replied
he
shaking
his
fine
white
head
i
find
her
very
feeble
we
must
increase
the
alimentation
force
it
a
little
juliana
interrupted
him
looking
at
me
the
while
with
a
very
wan
smile
he
examined
my
heart
well
i
asked
turning
abruptly
toward
the
old
man
i
thought
i
saw
a
shadow
pass
over
his
forehead
it
is
a
perfectly
healthy
heart
he
hastened
to
answer
it
only
needs
blood
and
quiet
come
come
be
brave
how
is
your
appetite
the
invalid
made
a
movement
of
the
lips
expressive
of
disgust
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
open
window
through
which
entered
the
warm
sunlight
it
is
cold
is
it
not
she
asked
timidly
putting
her
hands
beneath
the
one
could
see
that
she
was
shivering
the
following
day
federico
and
i
paid
a
visit
to
giovanni
di
scordio
it
was
the
last
afternoon
of
november
we
went
on
foot
crossing
the
tilled
fields
we
walked
along
silent
and
thoughtful
the
sun
slowly
set
on
the
horizon
an
impalpable
golden
dust
floated
above
our
heads
in
the
quiet
air
the
humid
earth
had
a
vigorous
brown
color
an
aspect
of
tranquil
energy
and
so
to
speak
a
peaceful
consciousness
of
its
virtue
from
the
furrows
mounted
a
visible
breath
like
that
exhaled
from
the
nostrils
of
cattle
beneath
the
soft
light
the
white
objects
took
on
an
extraordinary
whiteness
a
snowlike
purity
a
cow
in
the
distance
a
plowman
s
shirt
a
stretched
sheet
the
walls
of
a
shone
like
under
the
light
of
the
full
moon
you
are
sad
said
federico
to
me
gently
yes
i
am
sad
i
have
no
hope
left
there
was
another
long
silence
flocks
of
birds
rose
from
the
bushes
with
a
fluttering
of
wings
the
deadened
tinkling
of
the
little
bells
of
a
distant
troop
reached
us
of
what
are
you
hopeless
asked
my
brother
in
the
same
kind
way
of
juliana
s
health
and
also
of
mine
he
remained
silent
he
did
not
speak
a
single
word
of
consolation
perhaps
he
was
feeling
internally
the
pressure
of
pain
i
have
a
presentiment
i
went
on
that
juliana
will
never
leave
her
bed
he
remained
silent
we
passed
along
a
path
bordered
by
trees
and
the
fallen
leaves
crackled
beneath
our
feet
and
at
the
places
where
there
were
no
leaves
the
soil
had
a
hollow
sound
as
if
mined
by
subterranean
cavities
when
she
is
dead
i
added
what
will
become
of
me
a
sudden
fear
came
upon
me
a
sort
of
panicky
terror
and
i
looked
at
my
brother
who
remained
silent
with
a
frown
on
his
face
i
looked
about
me
at
the
mute
desolation
of
the
day
never
before
so
clearly
as
then
had
i
had
the
sensation
of
the
frightful
emptiness
of
life
no
no
tullio
said
my
brother
juliana
it
was
a
vain
assertion
without
any
value
in
face
of
the
fiat
of
destiny
and
yet
he
had
pronounced
these
words
with
a
simplicity
that
gave
me
a
shock
so
extraordinary
did
they
appear
to
me
thus
at
times
children
suddenly
say
things
that
go
straight
to
the
heart
and
as
if
a
prophetic
voice
spoke
through
their
unconscious
lips
can
you
read
the
future
i
asked
him
without
a
shadow
of
irony
no
but
i
have
that
presentiment
and
i
believe
it
once
more
my
brother
had
inspired
confidence
in
me
once
more
thanks
to
him
i
felt
a
slight
relaxation
of
the
iron
band
that
wounded
my
heart
but
it
was
only
a
short
respite
during
the
remainder
of
our
walk
he
spoke
to
me
of
raymond
when
we
were
near
the
place
inhabited
by
giovanni
di
scordio
federico
perceived
the
tall
figure
of
the
old
man
in
a
field
look
at
him
he
is
sowing
we
bring
him
the
invitation
at
a
solemn
hour
we
approached
my
inner
trembling
was
as
strong
as
if
i
were
on
the
point
of
committing
a
profanation
was
i
not
in
fact
about
to
profane
a
beautiful
and
great
thing
was
i
not
about
to
solicit
the
spiritual
paternity
of
that
venerable
old
man
for
the
child
of
adultery
see
what
a
noble
figure
cried
federico
stooping
and
pointing
to
the
sower
he
has
only
a
man
s
stature
and
yet
he
looks
like
a
giant
in
order
to
watch
him
we
stopped
behind
a
tree
at
the
edge
of
the
field
giovanni
attentive
to
his
labor
had
not
yet
perceived
us
he
walked
straight
before
him
in
the
field
with
measured
slowness
his
head
was
covered
by
a
green
and
black
woolen
cap
with
two
that
hung
down
his
cheeks
in
the
ancient
phrygian
fashion
a
little
white
bag
full
of
seed
and
attached
to
his
neck
by
a
leather
thong
hung
before
him
at
the
waist
with
his
left
hand
he
held
the
bag
open
while
with
his
right
he
took
out
the
seed
and
scattered
it
his
gesture
was
sweeping
vigorous
and
sure
cadenced
with
an
equal
rhythm
the
seed
flying
from
his
hand
flashed
an
instant
in
the
air
with
golden
scintillations
and
fell
in
an
equal
rain
on
the
humid
furrows
the
sower
advanced
slowly
burying
his
naked
feet
in
the
earth
which
yielded
beneath
his
steps
his
head
high
in
the
sanctity
of
the
light
his
entire
person
was
simple
sacred
and
grand
we
entered
the
field
my
respects
to
you
giovanni
cried
federico
going
forward
to
meet
the
old
man
blessed
be
your
seed
blessed
be
your
future
bread
my
respects
to
you
i
repeated
in
my
turn
the
old
man
left
his
work
and
uncovered
his
head
giovanni
you
must
cover
yourself
if
you
wish
us
to
remain
covered
said
federico
the
old
man
put
on
his
cap
smiling
confused
almost
intimidated
he
asked
with
a
modest
air
to
what
do
i
owe
so
much
honor
i
answered
in
a
voice
which
i
forced
to
be
firm
i
came
to
beg
you
to
hold
my
son
at
the
baptism
the
old
man
looked
at
me
with
surprise
then
he
looked
at
my
brother
his
confusion
increased
he
murmured
you
do
me
too
much
honor
well
what
is
your
answer
i
am
at
your
orders
may
god
reward
you
for
the
honor
you
have
done
me
may
god
be
praised
for
the
joy
that
he
has
accorded
me
in
my
old
age
may
the
benedictions
of
heaven
descend
on
your
son
thank
you
giovanni
i
gave
him
my
hand
and
i
saw
his
profound
and
sad
eyes
become
moist
from
tenderness
my
heart
swelled
with
acute
anguish
the
old
man
asked
me
what
name
will
you
give
him
raymond
the
name
of
your
father
of
sacred
memory
he
was
a
man
and
you
resemble
him
my
brother
said
do
you
sow
alone
alone
yes
i
sow
it
and
i
reap
it
he
showed
the
harrow
and
the
pickaxe
that
glittered
on
the
brown
earth
all
around
could
be
seen
the
still
uncovered
seed
the
germs
of
future
grain
my
brother
said
continue
we
will
leave
you
to
your
work
you
will
come
morning
to
the
badiola
farewell
giovanni
may
god
bless
your
work
we
clasped
that
unwearied
hand
sanctified
by
the
seed
it
scattered
by
the
good
it
had
shed
the
old
man
made
a
movement
to
accompany
us
as
far
as
the
road
but
he
stopped
and
said
not
without
hesitation
grant
me
one
favor
i
pray
you
speak
out
giovanni
he
opened
the
bag
suspended
from
his
neck
take
a
handful
of
seed
and
throw
it
on
my
furrows
i
plunged
my
hand
first
into
the
wheat
took
as
much
as
i
could
and
scattered
it
my
brother
did
the
same
and
now
heed
what
i
tell
you
continued
giovanni
di
scordio
in
an
agitated
voice
contemplating
the
seeded
ground
god
grant
that
my
godson
be
as
good
as
the
bread
raised
from
this
seed
amen
the
following
morning
the
baptismal
ceremony
took
place
without
festivity
or
pomp
on
account
of
juliana
s
condition
my
mother
my
brother
maria
natalia
miss
edith
the
midwife
the
and
the
chevalier
jemma
were
present
i
remained
by
the
invalid
s
bedside
a
heavy
somnolence
weighed
upon
her
she
scarcely
breathed
through
her
mouth
as
pale
as
the
palest
flowers
that
blossom
in
the
shade
darkness
reigned
in
the
alcove
on
looking
at
her
i
thought
can
i
not
save
her
i
have
succeeded
in
banishing
death
so
far
but
death
seems
to
be
returning
if
there
is
no
change
quickly
she
will
certainly
die
so
long
as
i
succeeded
in
keeping
raymond
away
from
her
so
long
as
i
succeeded
by
tenderness
in
causing
her
a
partial
illusion
and
forgetfulness
she
seemed
desirous
of
getting
well
but
when
she
sees
her
son
when
the
torture
begins
again
she
grows
worse
from
day
to
day
she
loses
more
blood
than
if
the
hemorrhage
still
continued
i
witness
her
agony
she
no
longer
hears
me
no
longer
obeys
me
as
she
did
before
who
will
be
the
cause
of
her
death
it
is
he
most
assuredly
he
who
will
kill
her
a
flood
of
hate
mounted
from
the
deepest
depths
of
my
being
and
i
felt
it
even
invade
my
hands
with
a
homicidal
impulse
i
saw
the
little
malefic
being
who
was
growing
fat
on
milk
who
prospered
in
peace
removed
from
all
danger
in
the
midst
of
infinite
cares
my
mother
loves
him
better
than
she
loves
juliana
my
mother
is
more
concerned
about
him
than
she
is
about
the
poor
dying
creature
oh
i
will
make
away
with
him
at
any
cost
i
must
and
the
vision
of
the
crime
already
consummated
passed
over
me
like
a
flash
the
vision
of
the
little
dead
body
in
the
little
innocent
corpse
in
its
coffin
the
baptism
shall
be
his
viaticum
giovanni
s
arms
will
carry
him
a
sudden
curiosity
seized
me
the
painful
spectacle
attracted
me
juliana
was
still
slumbering
i
cautiously
left
the
alcove
i
left
the
room
i
called
cristina
and
left
her
on
guard
then
with
rapid
step
i
walked
toward
the
gallery
suffocated
by
anguish
the
small
door
was
open
i
perceived
a
man
kneeling
before
the
railing
and
i
recognized
pietro
the
faithful
old
servant
who
was
with
us
at
my
birth
and
was
present
at
my
baptism
he
arose
not
without
pain
stay
stay
pietro
i
said
in
a
low
voice
placing
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
to
make
him
kneel
again
and
i
knelt
down
near
him
and
leaned
my
head
against
the
railing
and
looked
below
into
the
chapel
i
saw
everything
with
perfect
clearness
i
heard
the
formulas
of
the
ritual
the
ceremony
had
already
begun
i
learned
from
pietro
that
the
infant
had
already
received
the
salt
the
officiant
was
the
priest
of
tussi
don
gregorio
artese
he
was
at
that
moment
reciting
the
credo
with
the
sponsor
the
one
in
a
loud
voice
the
other
repeating
in
low
tones
giovanni
held
the
infant
with
his
right
arm
the
arm
which
the
evening
before
had
sowed
the
wheat
his
left
hand
was
laid
on
the
white
ribbons
and
laces
and
those
bony
hands
dry
and
brown
which
seemed
as
if
cast
in
living
hands
hardened
by
the
instruments
of
agriculture
sanctified
by
the
good
they
had
done
by
the
immense
labor
that
they
had
accomplished
and
now
occupied
in
holding
that
little
child
had
such
charming
delicacy
and
timidity
that
i
could
not
remove
my
gaze
from
them
raymond
did
not
cry
but
his
mouth
moved
ceaselessly
full
of
a
liquid
froth
that
ran
down
his
chin
on
to
the
embroidered
bib
after
the
exorcism
the
priest
wet
his
finger
with
saliva
and
touched
the
little
pink
ears
pronouncing
the
miraculous
word
then
he
touched
the
nostrils
saying
odorem
sanctitatis
then
he
dipped
his
thumb
in
the
oil
of
the
catechumens
and
while
giovanni
held
the
child
on
its
back
he
administered
the
unction
in
form
of
a
cross
on
the
chest
and
when
giovanni
turned
the
child
on
its
stomach
he
administered
the
unction
between
the
shoulder
blades
in
form
of
a
cross
saying
te
linio
oleo
salutis
in
christo
jesu
domino
nostro
then
with
a
small
tuft
of
cotton
he
wiped
off
the
unction
then
he
removed
the
violet
veil
the
color
of
mourning
and
of
sorrow
and
put
on
the
white
stole
in
token
of
joy
in
order
to
announce
that
the
original
sin
was
about
to
be
removed
and
he
addressed
raymond
by
his
name
putting
to
him
the
three
solemn
questions
which
the
sponsor
answered
credo
the
chapel
was
singularly
sonorous
a
ray
of
sunlight
entering
by
one
of
the
high
oval
windows
fell
upon
the
marble
paving
stones
covering
the
deep
sepulchres
where
several
of
my
ancestors
reposed
in
peace
my
mother
and
brother
stood
behind
giovanni
side
by
side
maria
and
natalia
stood
on
tiptoe
to
catch
a
view
of
the
child
inquisitive
smiling
from
time
to
time
whispering
to
each
other
these
whisperings
caused
giovanni
to
turn
partially
around
with
an
indulgent
gesture
indicating
all
the
ineffable
tenderness
which
the
old
man
bore
children
and
that
overflowed
from
his
big
heart
vis
baptizari
asked
the
officiant
responded
the
sponsor
repeating
the
word
that
had
been
prompted
to
him
the
clerk
presented
the
silver
basin
in
which
shone
the
baptismal
water
my
mother
removed
the
infant
s
hood
while
the
sponsor
extended
the
child
on
its
stomach
in
order
to
receive
the
ablution
the
round
head
on
which
i
could
distinguish
the
whitish
eruptions
of
the
hung
above
the
basin
and
the
priest
after
having
taken
some
water
from
a
little
vase
poured
it
three
times
on
the
child
s
head
each
time
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
te
baptize
in
nomine
patris
et
filii
et
spiritus
raymond
began
to
wail
violently
and
louder
still
when
his
head
was
being
dried
and
when
giovanni
raised
him
up
i
saw
that
his
face
was
reddened
by
the
afflux
of
blood
and
by
his
efforts
and
winkled
by
the
contractions
of
the
mouth
and
as
usual
the
wailings
caused
me
the
same
sensation
of
painful
laceration
the
same
exasperation
of
anger
nothing
in
him
irritated
me
more
than
that
voice
than
that
obstinate
wailing
which
for
the
first
time
had
struck
me
so
cruel
a
blow
on
that
lugubrious
october
morning
it
was
an
intolerable
shock
to
my
nerves
the
priest
dipped
his
thumb
into
the
consecrated
oil
and
anointed
the
neophyte
s
forehead
reciting
the
ritual
which
rose
above
the
wailings
then
he
put
on
the
white
robe
symbol
of
innocence
vestem
then
he
handed
the
blessed
taper
to
the
sponsor
lampadem
the
innocent
became
quiet
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
little
flame
that
trembled
at
the
tip
of
the
long
colored
candle
giovanni
di
scordio
bore
the
newly
made
christian
on
his
right
arm
and
with
his
left
hand
he
held
the
symbol
of
the
divine
fire
in
a
simple
and
grave
attitude
regarding
the
priest
who
recited
the
litany
he
towered
above
all
those
present
by
a
full
head
all
round
there
was
no
whiteness
as
pure
as
the
whiteness
of
his
hair
not
even
the
innocent
s
robe
in
pace
et
dominus
sit
my
mother
took
the
innocent
from
the
old
man
s
arms
pressed
him
against
her
bosom
and
kissed
him
my
brother
kissed
him
too
all
the
spectators
kissed
him
in
turn
near
me
pietro
was
still
on
his
knees
weeping
overcome
distracted
i
rose
abruptly
went
out
crossed
the
corridors
rapidly
and
entered
juliana
s
room
unannounced
cristina
asked
with
fear
lowering
her
voice
what
has
happened
signor
nothing
nothing
is
she
awake
no
signor
i
think
she
is
asleep
i
parted
the
curtains
and
softly
entered
the
alcove
at
first
i
perceived
nothing
in
the
darkness
but
the
whiteness
of
the
pillow
i
approached
and
bent
over
juliana
s
eyes
were
wide
open
and
were
gazing
at
me
fixedly
perhaps
she
divined
all
my
anguish
from
my
aspect
but
she
said
not
a
word
she
closed
her
eyes
again
as
if
never
to
open
them
from
that
day
began
the
last
and
vertiginous
period
of
the
lucid
madness
which
was
to
lead
me
to
the
crime
from
that
day
commenced
the
premeditation
of
the
easiest
and
surest
means
of
causing
the
innocent
s
death
it
was
a
cold
ingenious
incessant
premeditation
that
absorbed
all
my
inner
faculties
the
fixed
idea
possessed
me
absolutely
with
inconceivable
power
and
tenacity
all
my
being
labored
in
a
supreme
crisis
and
the
fixed
clear
rigid
idea
directed
me
without
deviation
toward
the
goal
as
if
i
were
gliding
along
over
steel
rails
my
perspicacity
seemed
to
be
trebled
nothing
escaped
me
within
me
or
about
me
there
was
not
a
single
minute
of
relaxation
in
my
circumspection
i
said
nothing
i
did
nothing
that
could
awaken
suspicion
or
cause
surprise
i
simulated
i
dissimulated
ceaselessly
and
not
only
with
my
mother
my
brother
and
all
the
others
who
knew
nothing
but
even
with
juliana
with
juliana
i
affected
resignation
appeasement
at
times
even
a
sort
of
forgetfulness
i
studied
to
avoid
the
slightest
allusions
to
the
intruder
i
sought
by
every
means
to
encourage
her
to
inspire
her
with
confidence
to
cause
her
to
observe
the
directions
that
must
bring
her
back
to
health
i
multiplied
my
zealous
endeavors
i
wanted
to
feel
for
her
a
tenderness
so
profound
so
forgetful
of
the
past
that
it
would
permit
her
to
again
find
the
freshest
and
purest
savor
in
life
i
felt
again
the
sensation
that
my
being
was
becoming
transfused
into
the
body
of
the
invalid
that
i
was
communicating
to
her
some
of
my
strength
that
i
imparted
an
impulse
to
her
exhausted
heart
it
was
i
it
seemed
who
from
day
to
day
forced
her
to
live
and
breathed
into
her
an
artificial
vigor
while
waiting
the
tragic
and
liberating
hour
i
repeated
to
myself
and
came
passed
disappeared
without
the
hour
having
sounded
i
again
repeated
i
was
convinced
that
the
mother
s
health
depended
on
the
child
s
death
i
was
convinced
that
after
the
suppression
of
the
intruder
she
would
be
cured
i
thought
it
would
be
impossible
for
her
not
to
get
well
she
would
resuscitate
gradually
be
regenerated
with
new
blood
she
would
appear
a
new
creature
freed
from
all
impurity
we
would
both
feel
purified
worthy
of
each
other
after
so
long
and
so
painful
an
expiation
the
illness
the
convalescence
would
relegate
the
sad
memories
to
an
indefinite
distance
and
i
would
try
to
efface
from
her
soul
even
the
shadow
of
the
recollection
i
would
try
to
cause
her
perfect
oblivion
in
love
after
this
great
trial
every
other
human
love
would
seem
frivolous
by
comparison
with
ours
the
vision
of
the
future
burned
me
with
impatience
the
incertitude
became
intolerable
to
me
the
crime
appeared
to
me
exempt
from
horror
i
bitterly
reproached
myself
for
the
perplexities
which
an
excess
of
prudence
kept
me
in
but
no
light
had
yet
illumined
my
brain
i
had
not
succeeded
in
finding
a
raymond
must
appear
to
have
died
a
natural
death
the
doctor
himself
must
not
have
a
glimmer
of
suspicion
of
the
various
methods
i
examined
not
one
seemed
to
me
satisfactory
practicable
and
yet
while
i
awaited
the
revealing
flash
the
divine
inspiration
i
felt
myself
attracted
by
a
strange
fascination
toward
the
victim
frequently
i
unexpectedly
entered
the
nurse
s
room
with
so
strong
a
palpitation
that
i
feared
she
would
hear
my
her
name
was
anna
she
was
a
woman
from
montegorgo
pausula
of
a
grand
race
of
robust
mountaineers
she
was
dressed
after
the
fashion
of
her
red
petticoat
with
a
thousand
straight
and
symmetrical
folds
a
black
corsage
embroidered
with
gold
with
two
long
sleeves
through
which
her
arms
were
rarely
passed
her
head
arose
above
her
very
white
chemise
but
the
whiteness
of
her
eyes
and
teeth
exceeded
in
intensity
the
snowy
whiteness
of
the
fabric
her
eyes
brilliant
like
enamel
remained
almost
always
motionless
without
revery
without
thought
the
mouth
was
large
taciturn
illuminated
by
a
row
of
even
and
teeth
the
hair
so
black
that
it
seemed
to
have
a
violet
reflection
was
parted
on
a
low
forehead
and
terminated
in
two
tresses
that
were
rolled
up
behind
the
ears
like
the
horns
of
a
ram
she
was
almost
constantly
seated
with
the
nursing
child
in
her
arms
in
a
sculptured
attitude
neither
sad
nor
joyous
i
entered
usually
the
room
was
dark
i
saw
the
white
spot
made
by
raymond
s
dresses
on
the
arm
of
that
bronzed
and
powerful
woman
who
fixed
on
me
her
eyes
like
those
of
an
inanimate
idol
without
a
word
and
without
a
smile
sometimes
i
stopped
and
watched
the
nursing
infant
sucking
at
the
rounded
breast
which
was
of
a
singularly
light
tone
in
comparison
with
the
face
and
crossed
by
blue
veins
he
sucked
sometimes
gently
sometimes
vigorously
sometimes
without
appetite
sometimes
with
sudden
avidity
the
soft
cheek
followed
the
movement
of
the
lips
the
throat
palpitated
with
every
aspiration
the
nose
almost
disappeared
beneath
the
pressure
of
the
swollen
breast
i
imagined
seeing
the
good
spread
through
that
tender
body
with
that
inflow
of
fresh
healthy
and
substantial
milk
i
imagined
that
at
every
new
swallow
the
vitality
of
the
intruder
became
more
tenacious
more
resistant
more
malefic
i
felt
a
dull
chagrin
at
noticing
that
he
was
growing
and
bore
no
indication
of
weakness
except
those
whitish
crusts
light
and
inoffensive
i
thought
have
not
all
the
agitations
all
the
sufferings
of
the
mother
while
she
was
bearing
him
done
him
some
harm
or
has
he
really
some
organic
vice
that
is
not
yet
manifest
but
which
in
the
end
could
develop
and
cause
his
death
one
day
when
i
found
him
undressed
in
his
cradle
i
surmounted
my
repugnance
i
felt
him
i
examined
him
from
head
to
foot
i
applied
my
ear
to
his
chest
to
listen
to
his
heart
beat
he
drew
up
his
little
limbs
then
forcibly
extended
them
he
waved
his
hands
all
covered
with
dimples
and
folds
he
buried
in
his
mouth
his
fingers
terminated
by
minute
nails
folds
of
flesh
accumulated
around
the
wrists
at
the
ankles
behind
the
knees
on
the
thighs
at
the
groins
on
the
lower
abdomen
several
times
also
i
watched
him
while
he
slept
i
looked
at
him
for
a
long
time
thinking
and
of
the
means
made
by
the
inner
vision
of
the
little
corpse
in
stretched
in
the
coffin
amidst
the
wreaths
of
white
chrysanthemums
between
four
lighted
candles
he
slept
very
peacefully
he
lay
on
his
back
his
fist
closed
over
his
thumb
at
times
his
moist
lips
made
a
movement
as
of
sucking
if
the
innocence
of
that
slumber
went
to
my
heart
if
the
unconscious
act
of
those
lips
softened
me
i
said
to
myself
as
if
to
make
my
resolution
firm
he
die
and
i
represented
to
myself
the
sufferings
already
endured
for
recent
sufferings
those
that
were
how
much
affection
he
usurped
to
the
detriment
of
my
own
children
and
juliana
s
agony
and
all
the
menaces
that
the
mysterious
tempest
suspended
over
our
heads
concealed
in
that
way
i
rekindled
my
homicidal
will
i
confirmed
the
sentence
of
the
sleeper
in
a
corner
in
the
dark
the
guardian
was
seated
the
woman
from
montegorgo
taciturn
motionless
like
an
idol
and
the
whiteness
of
her
eyes
the
whiteness
of
her
teeth
rivalled
in
brilliancy
the
large
golden
circles
in
her
ears
one
was
the
of
was
returning
to
the
badiola
with
federico
when
we
perceived
before
us
in
the
avenue
a
man
whom
we
recognized
to
be
giovanni
di
scordio
giovanni
cried
my
brother
the
old
man
stopped
we
approached
good
evening
giovanni
what
brings
you
here
the
old
man
smiled
timid
embarrassed
as
if
we
had
detected
him
doing
wrong
i
came
he
stammered
i
came
to
ask
about
my
godson
he
was
very
much
ashamed
one
would
have
thought
that
he
was
asking
pardon
for
his
temerity
you
wish
to
see
him
asked
federico
in
a
low
voice
certain
of
having
understood
the
sweet
and
sad
sentiment
which
stirred
the
heart
of
the
deserted
grandfather
no
only
came
to
don
t
you
wish
to
see
him
it
would
perhaps
be
too
much
now
come
said
federico
taking
him
by
the
hand
like
a
child
come
and
see
him
we
entered
we
went
up
to
the
nursery
my
mother
was
there
she
smiled
kindly
at
giovanni
and
cautioned
us
to
make
no
noise
he
is
asleep
she
said
and
turning
toward
me
she
added
with
uneasiness
he
coughed
a
little
the
news
agitated
me
and
my
agitation
was
so
manifest
that
my
mother
thought
she
reassured
me
by
adding
only
very
little
you
mere
nothing
already
federico
and
the
old
man
had
approached
the
cradle
and
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
they
looked
at
the
little
sleeper
the
old
man
had
bent
over
and
around
him
there
was
no
whiteness
as
pure
as
the
whiteness
of
his
hair
kiss
him
whispered
federico
he
rose
looked
at
my
mother
and
at
me
with
an
indefinite
look
then
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
mouth
over
his
chin
which
had
not
been
freshly
shaven
and
in
a
low
tone
he
said
to
my
brother
with
whom
he
was
less
ceremonious
if
i
kiss
him
my
beard
will
prick
him
and
certainly
awaken
him
my
brother
who
saw
that
the
poor
forsaken
old
man
was
dying
with
desire
to
kiss
the
child
encouraged
him
with
a
gesture
and
then
that
great
hoary
head
bent
over
the
cradle
softly
softly
softly
when
my
mother
and
i
were
alone
in
the
room
in
front
of
the
cradle
in
which
raymond
still
slept
with
the
kiss
on
his
forehead
she
said
to
me
very
much
moved
poor
old
man
do
you
know
that
he
comes
here
almost
every
evening
he
hides
himself
in
the
garden
i
heard
it
from
pietro
who
has
seen
him
wandering
around
the
house
the
day
of
the
baptism
he
had
the
window
of
this
room
pointed
out
to
him
doubtless
so
that
he
might
come
and
look
at
it
poor
old
man
how
sorry
i
am
for
him
i
listened
to
raymond
s
breathing
it
did
not
seem
to
me
to
be
changed
his
slumber
was
tranquil
i
said
so
he
coughed
yes
a
little
tullio
but
do
not
let
that
worry
you
perhaps
he
has
taken
cold
it
seems
impossible
that
he
should
have
taken
cold
with
so
many
precautions
a
flash
passed
through
my
brain
a
great
internal
trembling
assailed
me
suddenly
all
at
once
my
mother
s
presence
became
insupportable
i
was
agitated
i
was
discountenanced
i
feared
i
would
betray
myself
the
inner
idea
threw
out
such
flashes
that
fear
overtook
me
something
must
show
on
my
face
this
fear
was
vain
but
i
could
not
command
myself
i
made
a
step
forward
and
bent
over
the
cradle
my
mother
perceived
something
but
she
interpreted
it
in
my
favor
for
she
added
how
frightened
you
are
don
t
you
hear
how
calm
his
breathing
is
don
t
you
see
how
peaceful
his
sleep
is
but
in
spite
of
the
words
she
spoke
there
was
anxiety
in
her
voice
and
she
did
not
succeed
in
hiding
her
apprehension
from
me
you
are
right
it
is
nothing
i
answered
doing
myself
violence
do
you
remain
here
yes
until
anna
returns
i
left
the
room
i
went
to
juliana
she
expected
me
all
was
ready
for
her
dinner
which
i
habitually
took
with
her
so
that
the
invalid
s
meal
should
be
less
sad
and
that
my
example
and
my
pleading
should
persuade
her
to
eat
in
my
acts
in
my
words
i
showed
myself
unusually
exalted
i
was
a
prey
to
a
strange
superexcitation
of
which
i
had
an
exact
consciousness
but
although
capable
of
watching
myself
i
was
not
able
to
moderate
it
contrary
to
my
habit
i
drank
two
or
three
glasses
of
the
wine
prescribed
for
juliana
i
also
wished
her
to
take
more
than
usual
you
feel
a
little
better
do
you
not
yes
if
you
are
good
i
promise
you
that
you
shall
get
up
for
ten
days
more
you
can
regain
your
strength
in
ten
days
if
you
want
to
drink
a
little
more
juliana
she
looked
at
me
with
surprise
mingled
with
curiosity
making
an
effort
to
give
me
her
entire
attention
perhaps
she
was
already
tired
perhaps
her
eyelids
began
to
feel
heavy
the
raised
position
was
again
beginning
to
cause
in
her
the
symptoms
of
cerebral
anemia
she
moistened
her
lips
with
the
wine
that
i
handed
her
tell
me
i
continued
where
would
you
like
to
pass
your
convalescence
she
smiled
feebly
at
the
seaside
shall
i
write
to
aric
to
find
us
a
villa
if
only
the
ginosa
villa
were
free
do
you
remember
it
she
smiled
feebly
again
you
are
tired
perhaps
my
voice
tires
you
i
perceived
that
she
was
on
the
point
of
losing
consciousness
i
supported
her
i
removed
the
pillows
that
raised
her
and
put
her
at
her
ease
by
lowering
her
head
helped
her
with
the
usual
remedies
very
soon
she
seemed
to
come
to
for
she
murmured
as
if
in
a
dream
yes
yes
let
us
go
a
strange
anxiety
harassed
me
sometimes
it
was
like
a
sort
of
keen
pleasure
a
kind
of
confused
joy
sometimes
it
was
like
an
exasperating
impatience
and
unbearable
frenzy
sometimes
it
was
a
desire
to
see
some
one
to
search
for
some
one
to
speak
to
unbosom
myself
at
times
it
was
a
desire
for
solitude
a
desire
to
run
and
shut
myself
up
in
some
place
where
i
would
be
alone
with
myself
where
i
could
look
into
my
soul
clearly
where
i
could
follow
the
development
of
my
idea
examine
and
study
the
details
of
the
approaching
event
make
my
preparations
these
divers
and
extraordinary
impulses
and
still
other
impulses
innumerable
indefinable
inexplicable
succeeded
each
other
impetuously
in
my
soul
with
an
extraordinary
acceleration
of
my
inner
life
the
flash
that
had
traversed
my
brain
that
ray
of
sinister
light
seemed
all
at
once
to
have
illuminated
a
state
of
consciousness
seemed
to
have
awakened
a
deep
layer
of
my
memory
i
felt
that
it
was
a
but
despite
several
efforts
that
i
made
i
could
not
recover
the
origin
of
this
recollection
or
discover
its
nature
without
doubt
was
it
the
remembrance
of
something
read
long
ago
had
i
found
in
some
book
the
description
of
a
similar
case
or
had
some
one
told
me
the
particulars
as
having
occurred
in
actual
life
or
was
that
sensation
of
illusory
was
it
only
the
effect
of
a
mysterious
association
of
ideas
what
is
certain
is
that
the
means
it
seemed
to
me
had
been
suggested
to
me
by
some
strange
person
it
seemed
to
me
that
all
at
once
some
one
had
relieved
me
of
all
my
perplexities
by
saying
is
how
it
must
be
the
other
did
in
your
who
was
i
must
certainly
have
known
him
in
some
manner
but
in
spite
of
all
my
efforts
i
could
not
separate
him
from
myself
render
him
objective
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
define
with
exactness
the
singular
state
of
consciousness
in
which
i
found
myself
i
had
the
complete
notion
of
a
fact
in
all
the
circumstances
of
its
development
in
other
words
i
had
the
notion
of
a
series
of
acts
by
which
a
man
had
succeeded
in
putting
a
certain
project
in
execution
but
that
man
my
predecessor
was
unknown
to
me
and
i
could
not
associate
with
that
notion
the
images
relative
thereto
without
putting
myself
in
that
man
s
place
it
was
therefore
i
whom
i
saw
accomplishing
the
special
acts
already
accomplished
by
another
imitating
the
conduct
assumed
by
another
in
a
case
similar
to
mine
the
feeling
of
the
initial
spontaneity
was
lacking
when
i
left
juliana
s
room
i
passed
a
few
minutes
in
uncertitude
wandering
aimlessly
along
the
corridors
i
met
no
one
i
walked
toward
the
nursery
i
listened
at
the
door
i
heard
my
mother
speaking
in
a
low
voice
i
went
away
perhaps
she
had
not
left
the
cradle
had
the
infant
had
a
more
serious
attack
of
coughing
i
well
knew
the
bronchial
catarrh
to
which
babes
are
subject
that
terrible
malady
with
its
insidious
progress
i
remembered
the
danger
that
maria
had
run
in
her
third
month
i
remembered
all
the
symptoms
at
the
beginning
maria
had
sneezed
several
times
coughed
lightly
she
had
shown
a
strong
tendency
to
sleep
who
knows
i
thought
good
may
perhaps
intervene
in
time
and
i
may
be
saved
i
retraced
my
steps
i
listened
again
i
heard
my
mother
s
voice
again
i
entered
well
how
is
raymond
i
asked
without
dissimulating
my
emotion
he
is
doing
well
he
is
quiet
he
has
not
coughed
again
his
breathing
is
regular
and
temperature
normal
look
he
has
taken
the
breast
in
fact
my
mother
seemed
to
be
reassured
tranquillized
anna
seated
on
the
bed
was
nursing
the
infant
who
drank
eagerly
and
at
times
during
the
aspiration
his
lips
made
a
slight
noise
anna
s
face
was
bent
down
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
carpet
motionless
as
bronze
the
little
flickering
threw
reflections
and
shadows
on
her
red
petticoat
is
it
not
too
warm
here
i
said
because
i
felt
a
slight
suffocation
the
room
really
was
very
hot
in
a
corner
over
a
fire
some
had
been
placed
to
warm
the
hissing
of
boiling
water
could
also
be
heard
from
time
to
time
the
windows
were
rattled
by
the
whistling
howling
wind
do
you
hear
how
furious
the
wind
is
murmured
my
mother
i
became
inattentive
to
all
other
sounds
i
listened
to
the
wind
with
anxious
interest
several
shudders
ran
through
my
bones
as
if
a
stream
of
cold
had
penetrated
me
i
walked
toward
the
window
on
opening
the
inner
shutters
my
fingers
trembled
i
leaned
my
forehead
against
the
icy
glass
and
looked
out
but
the
mist
suddenly
produced
by
my
breath
prevented
my
seeing
anything
i
raised
my
eyes
and
saw
through
the
upper
window
the
scintillation
of
the
starry
sky
it
is
a
clear
night
i
said
leaving
the
window
within
me
i
had
a
vision
of
the
homicidal
night
clear
as
a
diamond
while
my
eyes
wandered
toward
raymond
who
was
still
feeding
has
juliana
eaten
anything
this
evening
asked
my
mother
of
me
in
an
affectionate
tone
yes
i
answered
rather
harshly
and
i
thought
this
whole
evening
you
have
not
found
a
minute
s
time
to
go
and
see
her
it
is
not
the
first
time
that
you
neglect
her
you
have
given
your
heart
to
raymond
the
following
morning
jemma
examined
the
child
and
declared
that
he
was
perfectly
healthy
he
attached
no
importance
whatever
to
the
cough
noticed
by
my
mother
then
smiling
at
the
excess
of
cares
and
anxiety
he
recommended
caution
during
the
very
cold
days
advised
extreme
prudence
in
washing
and
bathing
i
was
present
while
he
spoke
of
those
things
before
juliana
and
two
or
three
times
my
eyes
met
hers
in
fugitive
flashes
so
then
would
not
come
to
my
aid
i
must
act
i
must
profit
by
an
opportune
moment
hasten
the
event
i
made
up
my
mind
i
waited
for
the
evening
to
commit
the
crime
resolved
upon
i
gathered
together
all
that
yet
remained
of
my
energy
i
sharpened
my
perspicacity
i
studied
all
my
words
all
my
acts
i
said
nothing
i
did
nothing
that
could
awaken
suspicion
provoke
surprise
my
circumspection
did
not
relax
for
a
second
not
for
a
moment
did
i
feel
a
sentimental
weakness
my
inner
sensibility
was
compressed
suffocated
and
my
mind
concentrated
every
useful
faculty
to
prepare
the
way
for
the
solution
of
a
material
problem
that
was
expressed
as
follows
to
succeed
at
evening
to
remain
alone
with
the
intruder
for
several
minutes
under
certain
precise
conditions
of
security
in
the
course
of
the
day
i
entered
the
nursery
several
times
anna
was
always
at
her
post
an
impassable
guardian
if
i
addressed
a
few
questions
to
her
she
answered
in
monosyllables
her
voice
was
guttural
of
singular
quality
her
silence
and
inertia
irritated
me
as
a
rule
she
did
not
go
out
except
at
and
then
as
a
rule
she
was
replaced
by
my
mother
or
by
miss
edith
or
by
cristina
or
by
some
other
of
the
in
the
last
case
i
could
easily
rid
myself
of
the
witness
by
giving
an
order
but
there
always
remained
the
danger
that
some
one
would
unexpectedly
come
at
the
critical
moment
moreover
i
was
at
the
mercy
of
chance
since
i
was
not
able
to
select
the
substitute
myself
that
evening
as
on
several
evenings
past
it
would
probably
be
my
mother
however
it
seemed
to
me
impossible
to
indefinitely
prolong
my
espionage
and
anguish
to
keep
watch
endlessly
to
live
in
this
continual
expectation
of
the
fatal
hour
while
i
was
in
this
perplexity
miss
edith
entered
with
maria
and
natalia
two
little
graces
animated
by
a
run
in
the
open
air
enveloped
in
their
sable
fur
mantles
with
their
hoods
over
their
heads
gloved
hands
and
cheeks
rosy
from
the
cold
when
they
perceived
me
they
came
rushing
towards
me
joyously
and
for
several
minutes
the
room
was
full
of
their
chatter
the
mountaineers
have
come
cried
maria
the
nine
days
prayers
begin
this
evening
in
the
chapel
if
you
saw
the
manger
that
pietro
has
made
you
know
grandmother
has
promised
us
a
didn
t
she
miss
edith
we
must
put
it
in
mamma
s
room
mamma
will
be
well
by
christmas
won
t
she
oh
do
try
and
make
her
well
natalia
had
stopped
to
look
at
raymond
and
from
time
to
time
she
laughingly
made
a
face
at
the
infant
who
ceaselessly
moved
his
limbs
as
if
to
free
himself
from
his
bandages
a
caprice
seized
her
i
want
to
take
him
in
my
arms
she
noisily
insisted
on
having
him
she
put
forth
all
her
strength
to
carry
her
burden
and
her
face
grew
serious
as
if
she
were
playing
at
being
mother
with
her
doll
my
turn
now
cried
maria
the
odious
little
brother
passed
from
one
to
the
other
without
crying
but
suddenly
while
maria
walked
around
with
him
under
the
watchful
eyes
of
miss
edith
he
lost
his
equilibrium
and
was
about
to
slip
from
the
hands
that
held
him
edith
caught
him
took
him
gave
him
back
to
the
nurse
who
seemed
profoundly
absorbed
far
from
all
persons
and
surrounding
things
following
my
secret
thought
i
said
so
it
s
that
the
nine
days
prayers
begin
yes
i
looked
at
anna
who
seemed
startled
out
of
her
torpor
and
paid
unusual
attention
to
the
conversation
how
many
mountaineers
came
five
answered
maria
who
appeared
to
be
minutely
informed
about
everything
two
bagpipes
two
flageolets
and
one
fife
they
come
from
the
mountains
i
said
turning
toward
anna
perhaps
one
of
them
is
from
montegorgo
the
nurse
s
eyes
had
lost
their
hardness
had
become
animated
had
acquired
a
humid
and
sad
lustre
her
entire
face
visibly
expressed
extraordinary
emotion
then
i
understood
that
she
was
suffering
and
that
her
malady
was
homesickness
evening
approached
i
went
down
to
the
chapel
and
saw
the
preparations
for
the
nine
days
prayers
the
manger
the
flowers
the
candles
of
virgin
wax
i
went
out
without
knowing
why
i
looked
up
at
the
window
of
raymond
s
room
i
walked
up
and
down
the
lawn
with
rapid
steps
in
the
hope
of
overcoming
my
convulsive
trembling
the
acute
chill
that
penetrated
my
bones
the
spasm
that
contracted
my
empty
stomach
it
was
a
freezingly
cold
evening
a
greenish
lividity
spread
over
the
distant
horizon
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
valley
where
flowed
the
tortuous
assoro
the
river
glistened
solitary
a
sudden
fright
seized
me
i
thought
am
i
afraid
it
seemed
to
me
that
an
invisible
witness
was
watching
my
soul
i
felt
the
same
uneasiness
that
is
caused
at
times
by
a
fixed
and
magnetic
look
i
thought
am
i
afraid
of
what
of
accomplishing
the
act
or
of
being
discovered
i
was
frightened
by
the
great
trees
by
the
immensity
of
the
sky
at
the
reflections
of
the
assoro
at
all
the
confused
voices
of
the
fields
the
angelus
sounded
i
or
rather
i
rushed
in
as
if
some
one
were
at
my
heels
i
met
my
mother
in
the
corridor
which
had
not
yet
been
lighted
where
were
you
tullio
i
was
out
i
took
a
walk
juliana
is
waiting
for
you
when
do
the
nine
days
prayers
begin
at
six
o
clock
it
was
a
five
i
had
before
me
of
an
hour
i
must
pay
attention
i
will
go
to
her
mother
after
a
few
steps
i
called
her
back
has
not
federico
returned
no
i
went
up
to
juliana
s
room
she
was
waiting
for
me
cristina
was
laying
the
small
table
where
have
you
been
so
long
asked
the
poor
invalid
with
a
shade
of
reproach
in
her
voice
i
was
downstairs
with
maria
and
natalia
i
went
to
the
chapel
yes
the
nine
days
prayers
begin
she
murmured
sadly
with
a
discouraged
air
perhaps
you
will
hear
the
music
here
she
remained
pensive
for
several
minutes
i
thought
she
looked
very
sad
one
of
those
languishing
sadnesses
which
indicate
that
the
heart
is
swollen
with
tears
that
the
eyes
desire
to
weep
of
what
are
you
thinking
i
asked
i
am
thinking
of
my
first
christmas
at
the
badiola
do
you
remember
it
she
was
full
of
affection
and
she
solicited
my
tenderness
abandoned
herself
to
me
to
be
caressed
that
i
might
soothe
her
heart
and
drink
her
tears
but
i
thought
anxiously
i
must
take
care
not
to
favor
this
disposition
and
permit
myself
to
be
circumvented
time
passes
if
i
give
way
i
shall
not
be
able
to
leave
her
if
she
cries
i
shall
not
be
able
to
go
away
i
must
control
myself
time
is
passing
who
will
stay
with
raymond
surely
it
will
not
be
my
mother
it
will
be
the
nurse
no
doubt
all
the
others
will
be
in
the
chapel
i
will
keep
cristina
here
there
will
not
be
the
slightest
danger
the
occasion
is
as
favorable
as
it
can
be
in
twenty
minutes
i
must
be
free
i
avoided
exciting
the
invalid
i
feigned
not
to
understand
her
i
did
not
reply
to
her
effusions
i
sought
to
turn
her
attention
to
material
things
i
acted
in
such
a
manner
that
cristina
did
not
leave
us
alone
as
on
other
evenings
i
busied
myself
with
the
dinner
with
excessive
zeal
why
don
t
you
dine
with
me
this
evening
she
asked
me
i
can
t
eat
anything
just
now
i
don
t
feel
very
well
you
eat
a
little
please
in
spite
of
my
efforts
i
could
not
succeed
in
entirely
dissimulating
the
anxiety
that
devoured
me
several
times
she
looked
at
me
with
the
manifest
intention
of
penetrating
my
thoughts
then
all
at
once
she
became
gloomy
taciturn
she
scarcely
touched
anything
scarcely
moistened
her
lips
then
i
summoned
all
my
courage
in
order
to
withdraw
i
feigned
having
heard
the
roll
of
a
carriage
i
listened
i
said
no
doubt
federico
has
returned
i
must
see
him
at
once
you
will
excuse
me
if
i
go
downstairs
a
moment
cristina
will
stay
with
you
i
saw
her
face
change
as
if
she
was
about
to
burst
into
sobs
but
without
waiting
for
her
consent
i
left
hastily
and
i
took
care
to
order
cristina
to
remain
until
my
return
once
outside
i
was
compelled
to
stop
to
conquer
the
suffocation
of
anguish
i
thought
if
i
can
not
manage
to
control
my
nervousness
all
is
lost
i
listened
intently
but
heard
nothing
except
the
murmur
of
my
arteries
i
walked
along
the
corridor
as
far
as
the
stairway
without
meeting
any
one
the
house
was
silent
i
thought
they
are
all
in
the
chapel
already
even
the
servants
there
is
nothing
to
fear
i
waited
another
two
or
three
minutes
to
recover
myself
vague
ideas
passed
through
my
head
insignificant
foreign
to
the
deed
i
was
about
to
perform
i
mechanically
counted
the
rails
of
the
banister
it
is
surely
anna
who
is
with
him
raymond
s
room
is
not
far
from
the
chapel
the
music
will
proclaim
the
beginning
of
the
nine
days
prayer
i
walked
toward
the
door
as
i
reached
it
i
heard
the
prelude
of
the
bagpipes
i
entered
without
hesitation
i
had
guessed
correctly
anna
was
standing
near
her
chair
in
so
eager
an
attitude
that
i
immediately
guessed
that
she
had
sprung
to
her
feet
on
hearing
the
bagpipes
of
her
mountains
the
prelude
of
the
ancient
pastoral
is
he
asleep
i
asked
she
nodded
her
head
the
sounds
continued
muffled
by
the
distance
soft
as
in
a
dream
rather
shrill
sustained
prolonged
the
clear
tones
of
the
flageolets
modulated
the
simple
and
unforgettable
melody
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
pipes
you
may
go
too
i
said
to
her
i
will
stay
here
when
did
he
fall
asleep
just
now
you
can
go
her
eyes
sparkled
i
can
go
yes
i
will
stay
i
opened
the
door
for
her
myself
and
closed
it
behind
her
i
ran
toward
the
cradle
on
tiptoe
i
bent
over
to
have
a
better
view
the
innocent
was
asleep
in
his
his
little
fists
closed
over
his
thumbs
through
the
tissue
of
his
eyelids
the
iris
of
his
gray
eyes
was
visible
but
i
felt
no
blind
burst
of
hate
or
anger
rise
from
the
depth
of
my
soul
my
aversion
toward
him
was
less
impetuous
than
in
the
past
i
no
longer
felt
that
impulse
which
more
than
once
had
run
through
me
to
the
tips
of
my
hands
and
made
them
ready
for
any
criminal
violence
no
matter
what
i
solely
obeyed
the
impulse
of
a
cold
and
lucid
will
i
had
a
perfect
consciousness
of
my
actions
i
returned
to
the
door
i
opened
it
assured
myself
that
the
corridor
was
deserted
i
ran
to
the
window
i
recalled
what
i
had
heard
my
mother
say
the
suspicion
crossed
my
mind
that
giovanni
di
scordio
might
be
below
on
the
lawn
i
opened
the
window
with
infinite
precautions
a
blast
of
icy
air
came
in
i
bent
over
the
sill
i
saw
no
one
i
heard
only
the
musical
undulations
of
the
nine
days
prayers
i
drew
back
approached
the
cradle
i
conquered
my
repugnance
by
a
violent
effort
repressed
my
anguish
i
took
the
infant
up
very
gently
i
held
him
away
from
my
heart
that
beat
tumultuously
i
bore
him
to
the
window
i
exposed
him
to
the
air
that
was
to
make
him
perish
i
did
not
for
a
moment
lose
my
presence
of
mind
not
one
of
my
senses
was
dulled
i
saw
the
stars
of
the
sky
scintillating
as
if
in
the
superior
regions
a
blast
of
wind
had
shaken
them
i
saw
the
movements
illusory
but
terrifying
which
the
flickering
threw
among
the
folds
of
the
curtains
i
distinctly
heard
the
refrain
of
the
pastorale
the
distant
barking
of
a
dog
a
shudder
on
the
part
of
the
infant
made
me
start
he
awoke
i
thought
now
he
is
going
to
cry
how
long
a
time
has
passed
a
minute
perhaps
or
not
even
a
minute
will
so
short
an
impression
suffice
to
cause
his
death
has
he
received
his
the
infant
waved
his
arms
twisted
his
mouth
opened
it
it
was
a
little
time
before
he
began
to
wail
which
seemed
to
me
changed
more
pitiful
more
quivering
but
it
was
perhaps
because
it
did
not
resound
in
the
same
medium
as
usual
and
because
i
had
always
heard
him
in
a
closed
place
that
pitiful
quivering
wail
filled
me
with
fright
caused
me
a
sudden
fright
i
ran
to
the
cradle
in
which
i
replaced
the
child
i
returned
to
close
the
window
but
before
closing
it
i
bent
over
the
sill
and
peered
out
into
the
dark
i
saw
nothing
but
the
stars
i
closed
the
window
seized
as
i
was
by
terror
i
avoided
making
any
noise
behind
me
the
infant
cried
cried
louder
am
i
saved
i
ran
to
the
door
i
looked
into
the
corridor
i
listened
the
corridor
was
deserted
all
that
could
be
heard
was
the
slow
undulation
of
the
music
so
i
am
saved
who
could
have
seen
me
then
i
thought
again
of
giovanni
di
scordio
and
looking
at
the
window
i
again
felt
anxiety
but
no
there
was
no
one
below
i
looked
twice
i
went
back
to
the
cradle
arranged
the
infant
s
body
covered
him
carefully
assured
myself
that
everything
was
in
its
place
contact
with
him
made
me
feel
an
unconquerable
repugnance
he
cried
cried
what
could
i
do
to
quiet
him
i
waited
but
the
continual
wailing
in
that
large
solitary
room
that
inarticulate
plaint
of
the
ignorant
victim
rent
me
so
atrociously
that
incapable
of
longer
resistance
i
arose
in
order
to
relieve
my
torture
i
walked
out
into
the
corridor
i
the
door
behind
me
i
remained
outside
on
the
watch
the
child
s
voice
barely
reached
me
mingling
with
the
slow
undulation
of
the
music
the
sounds
continued
muffled
by
the
distance
soft
as
in
a
dream
somewhat
shrill
sustained
prolonged
the
clear
tones
of
the
flageolets
modulated
the
simple
melody
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
pipes
the
pastorale
filled
the
large
peaceful
house
reached
perhaps
even
the
most
distant
rooms
did
juliana
hear
it
what
did
juliana
think
what
did
she
feel
was
she
crying
i
knew
not
why
but
there
entered
into
my
soul
this
certitude
she
is
crying
and
the
certitude
gave
birth
to
an
intense
vision
that
engendered
a
real
and
profound
sensation
the
thoughts
and
visions
that
passed
through
my
brain
were
incoherent
fragmentary
absurd
the
fear
of
madness
invaded
me
i
asked
myself
how
much
time
has
passed
and
i
noticed
that
i
had
entirely
lost
all
notion
of
time
the
music
ceased
i
thought
the
prayers
are
over
anna
will
come
upstairs
my
mother
will
come
perhaps
raymond
is
no
longer
crying
i
the
room
i
looked
about
me
to
assure
myself
that
there
remained
no
trace
of
my
crime
i
approached
the
cradle
not
without
a
vague
fear
of
finding
the
child
lifeless
he
was
sleeping
lying
on
his
back
his
little
fists
closed
over
his
thumbs
he
is
asleep
it
is
unbelievable
one
would
think
nothing
had
happened
what
i
had
done
began
to
acquire
the
unreality
of
a
dream
i
experienced
a
sudden
blank
of
thoughts
an
empty
interval
during
those
moments
of
waiting
when
i
heard
the
nurse
s
heavy
step
in
the
corridor
i
went
forward
to
meet
her
my
mother
was
not
with
her
i
said
to
her
without
looking
in
her
face
he
is
still
asleep
and
i
rapidly
withdrew
i
was
saved
from
that
moment
my
mind
was
dazed
by
a
sort
of
stupid
inertia
perhaps
because
i
was
exhausted
incapable
of
a
new
effort
my
consciousness
lost
its
terrible
lucidity
my
attention
became
relaxed
my
curiosity
was
no
longer
equal
to
the
importance
of
the
events
that
were
developing
in
fact
my
recollections
were
confused
scarce
composed
of
indistinct
images
in
the
evening
i
returned
to
the
alcove
i
saw
juliana
again
i
remained
for
some
time
at
her
bedside
i
felt
too
fatigued
to
speak
looking
straight
into
her
eyes
i
asked
her
have
you
been
crying
she
answered
no
but
she
was
sadder
than
before
she
had
become
white
as
her
i
asked
her
what
ails
you
she
answered
nothing
and
you
i
do
not
feel
well
i
have
a
headache
an
immense
lassitude
overwhelmed
me
every
limb
weighed
me
down
i
leaned
my
head
on
a
corner
of
the
pillow
i
remained
several
minutes
in
that
position
beneath
the
weight
of
an
indefinable
sorrow
i
felt
a
shock
on
hearing
juliana
s
voice
saying
you
are
hiding
something
from
me
no
no
why
because
i
that
you
are
hiding
something
from
me
no
no
you
are
mistaken
i
am
mistaken
she
relapsed
into
silence
i
leaned
my
head
again
on
the
corner
of
the
pillow
several
minutes
later
she
said
to
me
suddenly
you
go
and
see
often
i
rose
to
look
at
her
seized
by
fear
you
go
to
see
him
voluntarily
she
added
i
know
it
well
that
frightens
me
and
makes
me
anxious
i
know
you
you
torment
yourself
you
go
there
to
torment
yourself
to
rack
your
heart
i
know
you
i
am
afraid
no
no
you
are
not
resigned
you
can
not
be
resigned
do
not
deceive
me
tullio
this
evening
just
now
you
were
there
how
do
you
know
i
know
it
i
it
my
blood
froze
do
you
want
my
mother
to
suspect
do
you
want
her
to
notice
my
aversion
we
spoke
in
low
tones
she
too
had
an
air
and
i
thought
there
is
my
mother
she
is
coming
all
upset
crying
raymond
is
dying
it
was
maria
and
natalia
who
entered
with
miss
edith
the
alcove
was
enlivened
by
their
chatter
they
spoke
of
the
chapel
of
the
manger
of
the
candles
the
bagpipes
giving
a
thousand
details
i
left
juliana
to
go
back
to
my
room
under
the
pretext
of
a
headache
when
i
was
on
my
bed
fatigue
overcame
me
almost
immediately
i
slept
profoundly
for
hours
daylight
found
me
calm
in
a
state
of
strange
indifference
inexplicable
indifference
nobody
had
come
to
interrupt
my
sleep
consequently
nothing
extraordinary
had
happened
the
events
of
the
evening
before
appeared
to
me
unreal
and
very
distant
i
felt
an
enormous
blank
between
my
actual
and
my
former
being
between
what
i
was
and
what
i
had
been
there
was
a
discontinuity
between
the
past
and
present
periods
of
my
psychical
life
and
i
did
not
make
the
slightest
effort
to
recover
myself
to
understand
the
strange
phenomenon
i
felt
a
repugnance
for
every
kind
of
activity
i
sought
to
keep
myself
in
that
sort
of
factitious
apathy
which
covered
the
obscure
development
of
all
my
preceding
agitations
i
avoided
examining
myself
in
order
not
to
awaken
things
that
appeared
dead
that
seemed
no
longer
to
belong
to
my
actual
existence
i
resembled
those
invalids
who
having
lost
all
sensibility
in
half
of
their
body
imagine
they
have
a
corpse
beside
them
but
federico
came
and
knocked
at
my
door
what
news
did
he
bring
his
presence
gave
me
a
shock
we
did
not
see
one
another
yesterday
evening
he
said
i
came
back
rather
late
how
do
you
feel
neither
well
nor
you
had
a
headache
they
told
me
yes
that
is
why
i
went
to
bed
early
ah
when
shall
we
see
the
end
of
all
our
anxieties
you
are
not
well
juliana
is
still
confined
to
her
bed
and
now
mother
is
very
much
frightened
because
raymond
coughed
during
the
night
he
coughed
yes
no
doubt
it
is
only
a
slight
cold
but
mother
exaggerates
as
usual
has
the
doctor
been
not
yet
but
you
seem
more
disturbed
than
mother
you
know
where
infants
are
concerned
fear
is
justifiable
a
trifle
suffices
he
looked
at
me
with
his
limpid
blue
eyes
and
i
feared
to
meet
them
when
he
had
gone
i
leaped
from
my
bed
so
the
effects
commence
i
thought
so
there
is
no
more
doubt
about
it
how
much
longer
has
he
to
live
perhaps
he
will
not
die
not
die
oh
no
that
is
impossible
the
air
was
icy
cut
short
his
respiration
and
again
i
saw
the
infant
breathing
again
i
saw
his
little
mouth
the
dimple
in
his
throat
the
doctor
said
there
is
no
reason
whatever
for
anxiety
it
is
nothing
but
a
slight
cold
the
are
free
he
bent
again
over
raymond
s
bare
breast
auscultating
him
there
is
not
the
slightest
obstruction
you
can
assure
yourself
by
listening
he
added
turning
toward
me
i
placed
my
ear
against
that
delicate
chest
and
felt
its
caressing
warmth
no
i
looked
at
my
mother
who
was
trembling
with
anxiety
on
the
other
side
of
the
cradle
the
ordinary
symptoms
of
bronchitis
were
absent
the
child
was
quiet
at
long
intervals
he
coughed
lightly
he
took
the
breast
as
often
as
usual
his
slumber
was
deep
and
regular
even
i
deceived
by
appearances
doubted
my
attempt
has
been
useless
it
seems
that
he
must
not
die
how
tenacious
his
hold
on
life
is
and
i
felt
the
old
rancor
against
him
born
in
me
more
acute
his
calm
and
healthy
appearance
exasperated
me
i
had
suffered
all
that
anguish
uselessly
then
i
had
exposed
myself
to
all
that
peril
for
nothing
with
my
anger
was
mingled
a
sort
of
superstitious
stupor
caused
by
the
extraordinary
tenacity
of
that
life
i
shall
not
have
the
courage
to
begin
over
again
and
then
it
is
i
who
will
be
his
victim
and
i
shall
not
be
able
to
escape
him
the
perverse
little
phantom
the
bilious
and
sly
child
full
of
intelligence
and
evil
instincts
reappeared
to
me
again
he
fixed
his
hard
gray
eyes
on
me
with
a
provocative
air
and
the
terrible
scenes
in
the
darkness
of
the
deserted
rooms
the
scenes
created
long
ago
by
my
hostile
imagination
presented
themselves
again
stood
out
again
in
relief
acquired
motion
all
the
characters
of
reality
the
day
was
cloudy
and
it
threatened
to
snow
juliana
s
alcove
again
seemed
like
a
refuge
the
intruder
could
not
be
taken
from
his
room
could
not
come
and
persecute
me
in
the
depths
of
that
retreat
i
abandoned
myself
altogether
to
my
sorrow
without
seeking
to
hide
it
while
looking
at
the
poor
invalid
i
thought
she
will
not
get
well
she
will
not
recover
the
strange
words
of
the
previous
evening
recurred
to
my
memory
troubled
me
without
any
doubt
the
intruder
was
an
executioner
for
her
as
well
as
for
me
without
any
doubt
he
imposed
himself
exclusively
on
her
thoughts
and
it
was
from
this
that
she
was
dying
by
degrees
so
heavy
a
weight
on
so
feeble
a
heart
with
the
incoherence
of
images
seen
in
a
dream
once
more
i
saw
in
mind
divers
fragments
of
my
previous
life
i
recollected
another
illness
a
convalescence
long
past
i
lingered
recomposing
these
fragments
reconstructing
that
period
so
charming
and
so
painful
during
which
i
had
sown
the
germ
of
my
misfortune
the
diffuse
whiteness
of
the
light
recalled
to
my
memory
that
mild
afternoon
which
we
had
passed
juliana
and
i
reading
that
book
of
poetry
bending
together
over
the
same
page
following
the
same
line
with
our
eyes
and
on
the
margin
i
saw
again
her
taper
the
mark
of
her
nail
accueillez
la
voix
qui
persiste
dans
son
naïf
épithalame
allez
rien
n
est
meilleur
à
l
âme
que
de
faire
une
âme
moins
triste
i
had
seized
her
wrist
i
slowly
bent
my
head
until
my
lips
touched
the
hollow
of
her
hand
i
murmured
you
could
you
forget
and
she
closed
my
mouth
pronouncing
her
great
word
silence
i
lived
that
fragment
of
life
over
again
under
the
form
of
a
real
and
profound
sensation
and
i
continued
continued
to
relive
my
past
i
came
to
the
morning
when
she
had
risen
for
the
first
terrible
morning
i
heard
her
laughing
and
broken
voice
i
saw
again
the
gesture
of
the
offering
i
saw
her
again
in
the
after
the
unexpected
shock
i
saw
again
what
had
followed
why
could
not
my
soul
free
itself
from
these
visions
it
was
useless
to
lament
utterly
useless
was
too
of
what
are
you
thinking
asked
juliana
who
up
to
then
perhaps
during
my
silence
had
suffered
only
on
account
of
my
sorrow
i
did
not
conceal
my
thoughts
from
her
and
she
in
a
voice
that
came
from
the
depths
of
her
heart
feeble
but
more
penetrating
than
a
cry
murmured
oh
i
had
a
heaven
for
you
in
my
soul
after
a
long
pause
during
which
doubtless
she
was
driving
back
to
her
heart
the
tears
that
did
not
come
she
said
i
can
not
console
you
now
any
more
there
is
consolation
neither
for
you
nor
for
me
there
never
will
be
all
is
lost
who
knows
i
said
we
looked
at
each
other
it
was
evident
that
at
that
instant
we
were
both
thinking
of
the
same
raymond
s
possible
death
after
hesitating
a
moment
i
alluded
to
the
conversation
we
had
had
one
evening
beneath
the
elms
have
you
prayed
my
voice
trembled
greatly
she
answered
i
scarcely
heard
her
yes
and
she
shut
her
eyes
turned
on
her
side
buried
her
head
in
the
pillow
gathered
herself
together
huddled
beneath
the
covers
as
if
chilled
by
cold
in
the
evening
i
went
to
see
raymond
i
found
him
in
my
mother
s
arms
he
seemed
rather
pale
but
he
was
still
quiet
he
breathed
freely
no
suspicious
symptom
was
noticeable
he
only
just
woke
up
said
my
mother
does
that
make
you
uneasy
yes
he
has
never
slept
so
long
before
i
looked
fixedly
at
the
child
his
gray
eyes
were
dull
and
lifeless
he
incessantly
moved
his
lips
as
if
chewing
at
one
moment
he
vomited
a
little
curdled
milk
on
his
bib
oh
no
no
the
child
is
not
well
cried
my
mother
shaking
her
head
has
he
coughed
as
if
in
answer
to
my
question
raymond
began
to
cough
do
you
hear
it
was
a
little
hoarse
cough
unaccompanied
by
any
sound
of
any
of
the
internal
organs
it
ceased
immediately
i
thought
we
must
wait
but
in
proportion
as
the
fatal
presentiment
was
resuscitated
in
me
my
aversion
toward
the
intruder
diminished
my
irritation
subsided
i
perceived
that
my
heart
remained
oppressed
and
miserable
incapable
of
a
single
joyful
transport
i
remember
that
evening
as
being
the
saddest
i
have
ever
passed
during
the
course
of
my
fatal
career
supposing
that
giovanni
di
scordio
might
be
in
the
neighborhood
i
left
the
house
and
walked
along
the
walk
where
my
brother
and
i
had
met
him
the
last
time
there
were
signs
of
a
snowstorm
in
the
night
air
under
the
row
of
trees
stretched
a
carpet
of
leaves
the
bare
and
dry
branches
stood
out
against
the
sky
i
looked
around
me
in
the
hope
of
seeing
the
old
man
i
thought
of
his
tenderness
for
his
godson
of
that
senile
and
desolate
love
of
those
large
callous
and
rugged
hands
which
i
had
seen
become
ennobled
and
tremble
on
the
whiteness
of
his
clothes
i
thought
how
he
will
weep
i
saw
the
little
dead
body
in
its
lying
in
its
coffin
amidst
the
wreaths
of
white
chrysanthemums
between
four
lighted
candles
and
giovanni
weeping
on
his
knees
my
mother
will
weep
will
be
in
despair
the
entire
house
will
be
in
mourning
christmas
will
be
funereal
and
what
will
juliana
do
when
i
present
myself
on
the
threshold
of
the
alcove
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
announce
he
is
dead
i
had
arrived
to
the
end
of
the
avenue
i
looked
around
i
saw
no
one
the
country
was
silently
disappearing
in
the
darkness
a
fire
shone
red
on
the
hill
very
distant
i
retraced
my
steps
alone
suddenly
something
white
trembled
before
my
eyes
and
disappeared
it
was
the
first
snow
that
evening
while
i
was
at
juliana
s
bedside
i
again
heard
the
bagpipes
continuing
the
nine
days
prayer
the
same
the
evening
passed
the
night
passed
the
following
morning
passed
nothing
extraordinary
happened
but
the
doctor
on
his
visit
did
not
conceal
the
fact
that
there
existed
a
catarrh
of
the
nasal
mucosa
and
larger
bronchi
a
slight
indisposition
of
no
gravity
whatever
nevertheless
i
perceived
that
he
tried
to
dissimulate
a
certain
uneasiness
he
gave
various
orders
recommended
the
greatest
prudence
promised
to
return
during
the
day
my
mother
had
no
more
rest
on
entering
the
alcove
i
said
to
juliana
in
a
low
voice
without
looking
her
in
the
face
he
is
getting
worse
and
we
were
silent
for
a
long
time
at
moments
i
arose
and
walked
to
the
window
to
watch
the
snow
i
walked
about
the
room
the
prey
of
unbearable
anxiety
juliana
her
head
buried
in
the
pillow
was
almost
hidden
beneath
the
covers
when
i
approached
she
opened
her
eyes
and
gave
me
a
rapid
look
which
told
me
nothing
are
you
cold
yes
but
the
room
was
warm
i
returned
ceaselessly
to
the
window
to
watch
the
snow
and
the
whitened
country
on
which
the
flakes
continued
to
fall
slowly
it
was
two
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
what
was
passing
in
the
child
s
room
nothing
very
extraordinary
certainly
since
they
had
not
called
me
but
my
anxiety
increased
so
much
that
i
resolved
to
go
to
see
i
opened
the
door
where
are
you
going
cried
juliana
raising
herself
on
her
elbow
i
am
going
downstairs
for
a
moment
i
will
return
immediately
she
remained
raised
on
her
elbow
very
pale
do
you
not
want
me
to
go
i
asked
no
stay
with
me
she
did
not
let
herself
sink
back
on
her
pillow
a
strange
fright
had
changed
her
expression
her
eyes
wandered
restlessly
as
if
pursuing
a
moving
shadow
i
approached
her
and
laid
her
down
myself
arranged
her
in
the
bed
touched
her
forehead
asked
her
gently
what
ails
you
juliana
i
do
not
know
i
am
afraid
of
what
i
do
not
know
it
is
not
my
fault
i
am
ill
i
am
like
that
but
her
eyes
instead
of
fixing
themselves
on
me
continued
to
wander
what
are
you
seeking
do
you
see
something
no
nothing
i
touched
her
forehead
again
its
warmth
was
normal
but
my
imagination
began
to
be
disturbed
you
see
i
do
not
leave
you
i
ll
stay
with
you
i
sat
down
i
waited
my
soul
was
in
that
state
of
anxious
suspension
which
accompanies
the
expectation
of
an
approaching
event
i
was
certain
that
i
should
be
called
i
listened
for
the
slightest
sound
from
time
to
time
i
heard
bells
ring
in
the
house
i
heard
the
dull
roll
of
a
carriage
on
the
snow
i
said
it
is
probably
the
doctor
juliana
did
not
utter
a
word
i
waited
an
interminable
length
of
time
passed
suddenly
i
heard
a
sound
of
opening
doors
a
sound
of
approaching
steps
i
sprang
to
my
feet
and
at
the
same
instant
juliana
raised
herself
what
is
the
matter
i
knew
what
was
the
matter
i
even
knew
the
precise
words
that
the
messenger
was
going
to
utter
cristina
entered
she
seemed
agitated
but
tried
to
dissimulate
it
without
coming
near
me
but
giving
me
a
significant
look
she
stammered
may
i
say
something
to
signor
i
left
the
alcove
what
is
the
matter
she
answered
in
a
low
voice
the
child
is
much
worse
come
quickly
signor
juliana
i
am
going
out
for
a
moment
cristina
will
stay
with
you
i
will
return
immediately
i
left
the
room
and
ran
into
raymond
s
room
ah
tullio
the
child
is
dying
cried
my
mother
in
despair
bending
over
the
cradle
look
look
at
him
i
bent
over
the
cradle
a
rapid
change
had
taken
place
unexpected
apparently
inexplicable
frightful
the
little
face
had
become
of
an
ashen
color
the
lips
had
blanched
the
eyes
were
faded
dull
lifeless
the
poor
creature
seemed
to
be
under
the
effect
of
some
violent
poison
my
mother
told
me
in
a
choking
voice
an
hour
ago
he
seemed
quite
well
he
coughed
a
little
but
that
was
all
i
went
out
and
left
anna
in
the
room
i
thought
i
should
find
him
still
asleep
he
seemed
sleepy
i
returned
and
found
him
in
this
condition
touch
him
he
is
almost
cold
i
touched
his
forehead
and
his
cheek
the
temperature
in
fact

they
should
have
taken
the
carriage
yes
cyriaque

gone
are
you
sure
there
is
no
time
to
lose
this
was
no
simulation
on
my
part
i
was
sincere
i
could
not
let
the
innocent
die
like
that
without
making
an
attempt
to
save
him
in
presence
of
his
almost
cadaveric
aspect
although
my
crime
was
on
the
point
of
being
consummated
pity
remorse
and
grief
seized
my
soul
while
waiting
for
the
doctor
i
was
not
less
distracted
than
my
mother
i
rang
a
servant
answered
has
cyriaque
gone
yes
signor
on
foot
no
signor
in
the
carriage
federico
came
in
panting
what
has
happened
my
mother
still
bending
over
the
cradle
cried
out
the
baby
is
dying
federico
ran
up
and
looked
he
is
choking
he
said
don
t
you
see
he
has
stopped
breathing
and
he
seized
the
child
took
it
from
the
cradle
raised
it
and
shook
it
no
no
what
are
you
doing
you
will
kill
him
cried
my
mother
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
and
a
voice
announced
the
doctor
doctor
jemma
entered
i
was
on
my
way
i
met
your
man
what
has
happened
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
went
up
to
my
brother
who
still
held
raymond
in
his
arms
he
took
the
child
examined
him
became
serious
he
must
be
undressed
he
said
and
he
put
him
on
the
nurse
s
bed
and
helped
my
mother
to
remove
his
clothes
the
little
naked
body
appeared
it
was
of
the
same
clayey
color
as
the
face
the
limbs
hung
flaccid
inert
the
doctor
s
fat
hand
felt
the
skin
in
several
places
do
something
for
him
doctor
begged
my
mother
save
him
but
the
doctor
seemed
irresolute
he
felt
the
pulse
put
his
ear
to
the
chest
and
murmured
a
spasm
of
the
heart
impossible
he
asked
when
did
this
change
take
place
suddenly
my
mother
tried
to
tell
what
she
had
told
me
but
she
burst
into
sobs
before
she
could
finish
the
doctor
decided
to
try
something
he
tried
to
shock
the
torpor
into
which
the
infant
was
plunged
he
tried
to
make
him
cry
to
provoke
vomiting
to
stimulate
a
movement
of
energetic
breathing
my
mother
stood
by
watching
him
and
tears
streamed
from
her
eyes
has
juliana
been
told
asked
my
brother
no
i
believe
not
she
suspects
perhaps
perhaps
cristina
stay
here
i
will
run
and
see
and
come
back
i
looked
at
the
child
as
he
lay
in
the
doctor
s
hands
i
looked
at
my
mother
i
left
the
room
and
ran
to
juliana
s
room
at
the
door
i
stopped
what
shall
i
tell
her
shall
i
tell
her
the
truth
i
entered
i
saw
that
cristina
was
still
in
the
embrasure
of
the
window
i
entered
the
alcove
the
curtains
of
which
were
now
drawn
juliana
was
huddled
up
under
the
covers
as
i
approached
her
i
noticed
that
she
was
shaking
as
if
with
fever
juliana
it
is
i
she
turned
round
and
asked
in
a
low
voice
were
you
yes
tell
me
all
i
bent
over
her
and
we
spoke
in
low
tones
it
is
very
serious
very
serious
yes
very
serious
is
he
dying
who
knows
perhaps
with
a
sudden
movement
she
disengaged
her
arms
and
threw
them
around
my
neck
my
cheek
pressed
against
hers
and
i
felt
her
tremble
i
felt
the
leanness
of
her
poor
sickly
bosom
and
while
she
embraced
me
i
had
before
my
mind
the
sinister
vision
of
the
distant
room
i
saw
the
child
with
his
faded
lifeless
opaque
eyes
and
livid
lips
i
saw
my
mother
s
tears
flowing
there
was
no
joy
in
that
embrace
my
heart
was
oppressed
and
my
soul
bent
thus
over
the
obscure
abyss
of
that
other
soul
felt
helpless
and
by
raymond
was
dead
all
the
indications
of
acute
poisoning
by
carbonic
acid
appeared
on
the
little
body
that
had
become
a
corpse
the
little
face
was
livid
and
leaden
the
nose
was
pinched
the
lips
had
taken
on
a
dark
blue
color
a
glimpse
of
the
opaque
whiteness
could
be
caught
beneath
the
still
eyelids
on
one
thigh
near
the
groin
was
a
reddish
spot
it
seemed
as
if
decomposition
had
already
set
in
so
lamentable
was
the
appearance
of
that
infantile
flesh
which
a
few
hours
before
all
rosy
and
tender
had
been
caressed
by
my
mother
s
fingers
in
my
ears
resounded
the
cries
the
sobs
the
distracted
words
ejaculated
by
my
mother
while
federico
and
the
women
led
her
out
of
the
room
nobody
must
touch
him
let
no
one
touch
him
i
want
to
wash
him
myself
i
wish
to
dress
him
myself
then
silence
followed
the
cries
had
ceased
at
moments
could
be
heard
a
slamming
of
doors
i
was
there
alone
the
doctor
had
been
in
the
room
too
but
i
was
now
alone
some
extraordinary
change
was
taking
place
within
me
but
i
did
not
yet
know
exactly
what
it
was
come
said
the
doctor
gently
touching
me
on
the
shoulder
come
leave
the
room
i
was
docile
i
obeyed
i
walked
slowly
along
the
corridor
when
i
felt
another
touch
it
was
federico
he
embraced
me
i
did
not
cry
i
did
not
feel
any
strong
emotion
i
did
not
understand
his
words
yet
i
heard
when
he
named
juliana
s
name
take
me
to
juliana
s
room
i
said
to
him
i
put
my
arm
beneath
his
i
let
myself
be
conducted
like
a
blind
man
when
we
were
in
front
of
the
door
i
said
leave
me
he
pressed
my
hand
and
left
me
i
entered
alone
in
the
night
the
silence
of
the
house
was
sepulchral
a
light
burned
in
the
corridor
i
walked
toward
that
light
like
a
somnambulist
some
extraordinary
change
was
taking
place
within
me
but
i
did
not
yet
know
exactly
what
it
was
i
stopped
warned
by
a
sort
of
instinct
a
door
was
open
a
light
filtered
through
the
drawn
curtains
i
crossed
the
threshold
parted
the
portières
and
advanced
the
cradle
was
in
the
centre
of
the
room
between
four
lighted
candles
and
draped
with
white
my
brother
was
seated
on
one
side
giovanni
di
scordio
on
the
other
holding
the
vigil
the
old
man
s
presence
caused
me
no
surprise
it
seemed
to
me
natural
that
he
should
be
there
i
asked
nothing
i
said
nothing
i
believe
that
i
smiled
faintly
at
them
when
they
looked
at
me
i
do
not
know
if
my
lips
really
smiled
but
i
had
intended
they
should
as
if
to
say
do
not
grieve
about
me
do
not
try
to
console
me
you
see
i
am
calm
we
must
be
resigned
i
made
several
steps
i
went
and
placed
myself
at
the
foot
of
the
cradle
between
the
two
candles
to
the
foot
of
this
cradle
i
bore
a
fearful
humble
feeble
soul
totally
freed
from
its
previous
passions
my
brother
and
the
old
man
had
not
left
their
places
and
yet
i
felt
alone
the
little
dead
body
was
clothed
in
white
in
the
same
robe
in
which
it
was
baptized
it
seemed
to
me
only
the
face
and
the
hands
were
uncovered
the
little
mouth
whose
wailings
had
so
often
aroused
my
hate
was
now
motionless
beneath
a
mysterious
seal
the
silence
that
reigned
over
this
mouth
also
reigned
in
me
reigned
about
me
and
i
looked
looked
then
in
the
silence
there
arose
a
great
light
in
the
centre
of
my
soul
that
which
neither
my
brother
s
words
nor
the
old
man
s
smile
had
been
sufficient
to
reveal
to
me
the
little
dumb
mouth
of
the
innocent
revealed
to
me
in
a
second
and
then
i
was
assailed
by
a
terrible
desire
to
confess
my
crime
to
publish
my
secret
to
declare
in
the
presence
of
those
two
men
it
was
i
who
assassinated
him
they
both
looked
at
me
and
i
perceived
that
they
were
both
uneasy
concerning
me
and
my
attitude
before
the
corpse
that
they
were
both
waiting
with
anguish
the
end
of
my
silence
then
i
said
do
you
know
who
killed
this
innocent
in
the
silence
my
voice
was
so
strangely
sonorous
that
it
was
unrecognizable
to
me
it
seemed
to
me
that
that
voice
was
not
my
own
and
a
sudden
terror
froze
my
blood
stiffened
my
tongue
clouded
my
sight
and
i
began
to
tremble
and
i
felt
that
my
brother
was
supporting
me
was
holding
my
head
in
my
ears
was
such
a
strong
buzzing
that
his
words
reached
me
indistinctly
in
fragments
i
understood
that
he
thought
my
mind
was
deranged
by
a
violent
attack
of
fever
and
that
he
was
trying
to
lead
me
out
i
let
him
take
me
away
he
led
me
to
my
room
supporting
me
terror
still
controlled
me
at
the
sight
of
a
single
candle
that
was
burning
on
the
table
i
shuddered
i
could
not
remember
having
left
it
lit
undress
yourself
and
go
to
bed
said
federico
to
me
stroking
me
with
his
hands
tenderly
he
made
me
sit
down
on
my
bed
and
felt
my
forehead
again
listen
your
fever
is
increasing
begin
to
undress
come
come
with
a
tenderness
that
recalled
that
of
my
mother
he
assisted
me
to
undress
he
helped
me
to
get
into
bed
seated
at
my
bedside
he
felt
my
forehead
from
time
to
time
to
judge
of
my
fever
and
as
he
saw
that
i
still
trembled
he
asked
are
you
very
cold
does
not
your
shivering
cease
at
all
shall
i
cover
you
more
are
you
thirsty
shivering
i
thought
suppose
i
had
spoken
suppose
i
had
had
the
strength
to
keep
on
was
it
i
positively
i
who
with
my
own
lips
spoke
those
words
was
it
absolutely
i
and
suppose
federico
on
thinking
them
over
on
deeply
reflecting
began
to
suspect
i
asked
do
you
know
who
killed
this
innocent
nothing
more
but
had
i
not
the
aspect
of
an
assassin
about
to
confess
on
thinking
it
over
federico
could
not
fail
to
ask
himself
what
did
he
want
to
say
against
whom
did
he
direct
that
strange
accusation
my
excitement
will
seem
equivocal
the
doctor
he
must
think
perhaps
he
alluded
to
the
he
must
have
some
new
proof
of
my
exaltation
he
must
continue
to
believe
my
mind
deranged
by
fever
in
a
condition
of
intermittent
delirium
while
i
reasoned
thus
rapid
and
clear
visions
passed
through
my
mind
with
evidence
of
real
and
tangible
things
i
am
feverish
and
very
strongly
so
what
if
true
delirium
should
set
in
what
if
i
unconsciously
revealed
my
secret
i
watched
over
myself
with
frightful
anguish
i
said
the
doctor
the
not
know
my
brother
bent
over
me
felt
my
forehead
again
uneasily
emitted
a
sigh
do
not
worry
tullio
be
quiet
and
he
went
and
wrung
out
a
linen
in
cold
water
and
applied
it
to
my
burning
head
the
procession
of
rapid
and
clear
visions
continued
i
saw
again
the
baby
s
agony
with
terrible
intensity
he
was
agonizing
in
his
cradle
his
face
was
ashen
so
pallid
that
the
milk
crusts
above
the
eyebrows
appeared
yellow
the
lower
lip
depressed
was
invisible
from
time
to
time
he
raised
his
eyelids
that
were
lightly
tinted
with
violet
and
one
would
have
thought
that
the
irides
were
adherent
because
they
followed
the
ascending
movement
and
lost
themselves
beneath
leaving
a
view
only
of
the
opaque
whites
from
time
to
time
the
choking
death
rattle
was
interrupted
at
one
time
the
doctor
said
as
if
to
make
a
supreme
attempt
quick
quick
let
us
take
the
cradle
near
the
open
window
room
room
the
little
one
needs
air
make
room
my
brother
and
i
carried
the
cradle
which
seemed
like
a
coffin
but
in
the
daylight
the
spectacle
was
still
more
frightful
beneath
that
cold
white
light
reflected
by
the
snow
my
mother
cried
he
is
dying
look
look
he
is
dying
feel
his
pulse
has
stopped
and
the
doctor
said
no
no
he
breathes
as
long
as
there
is
a
sigh
there
is
some
hope
and
between
the
livid
lips
of
the
dying
child
he
introduced
a
spoonful
of
ether
after
a
few
seconds
the
child
opened
his
eyes
turned
up
his
pupils
and
gave
a
feeble
wail
a
slight
change
took
place
in
his
color
his
nostrils
quivered
the
doctor
said
don
t
you
see
he
breathes
we
must
hope
even
to
the
end
he
agitated
the
air
above
the
cradle
with
a
fan
then
with
his
finger
he
depressed
the
baby
s
chin
in
order
to
unclose
his
lips
to
open
the
mouth
the
tongue
clove
to
the
palate
fell
down
like
a
clapper
and
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
mucus
that
stretched
between
the
palate
and
the
tongue
the
whitish
matter
accumulated
in
the
throat
a
convulsive
movement
raised
towards
the
face
the
little
hands
that
had
become
violet
particularly
at
the
palms
at
the
folds
of
the
phalanges
and
at
the
already
cadaverous
and
which
my
mother
touched
each
moment
the
little
finger
of
the
right
hand
was
always
kept
apart
away
from
the
other
fingers
and
trembled
lightly
nothing
could
be
more
lamentable
federico
tried
to
persuade
my
mother
to
leave
the
room
but
bent
over
raymond
s
face
almost
touching
it
she
watched
the
slightest
indications
one
of
her
tears
fell
on
the
adored
one
s
head
quickly
she
dried
it
with
her
handkerchief
but
she
perceived
that
on
the
head
the
fontanels
were
sunk
depressed
look
doctor
she
cried
with
fright
and
my
eyes
fixed
themselves
on
that
soft
head
dotted
with
milk
crusts
yellowish
like
a
piece
of
wax
in
the
midst
of
which
a
hollow
had
been
made
all
the
sutures
were
visible
the
bluish
temporal
vein
was
lost
beneath
the
crusts
look
look
the
vital
energy
reawakened
for
a
moment
by
the
artificial
means
of
ether
subsided
the
death
rattle
began
to
acquire
a
characteristic
sonorousness
the
little
hands
fell
along
the
sides
inert
the
chin
retracted
more
the
fontanels
became
deeper
and
no
longer
pulsated
all
at
once
the
dying
child
seemed
to
make
an
effort
quickly
the
doctor
raised
the
head
and
there
came
from
the
little
violet
mouth
a
small
quantity
of
a
whitish
liquid
but
in
the
effort
made
in
vomiting
the
skin
of
the
forehead
was
stretched
and
through
the
epidermis
the
brown
spots
of
an
effusion
could
be
seen
appearing
my
mother
uttered
a
cry
come
come
go
with
me
repeated
my
brother
trying
to
lead
her
away
no
no
no
the
doctor
administered
another
spoonful
of
ether
and
the
agony
was
prolonged
the
torture
was
prolonged
the
little
hands
rose
up
again
the
fingers
stirred
vaguely
between
the
pupils
the
irides
appeared
then
disappeared
by
a
retrograde
movement
like
two
little
faded
flowers
like
two
little
corollas
that
closed
with
a
flaccid
curling
up
evening
fell
and
the
innocent
was
still
in
agony
on
the
shone
a
light
like
the
glimmer
of
approaching
dawn
due
to
the
whiteness
of
the
snow
conflicting
with
the
shadows
he
is
dead
he
is
dead
cried
my
mother
who
no
longer
heard
the
death
rattle
and
who
saw
a
livid
spot
appear
around
the
nose
no
no
he
is
breathing
a
candle
had
been
lit
one
of
the
women
held
it
and
the
little
yellow
flame
flickered
at
the
foot
of
the
cradle
abruptly
my
mother
uncovered
the
little
body
to
feel
it
he
is
cold
cold
all
over
the
limbs
were
stretched
out
the
feet
were
becoming
violet
nothing
could
be
more
lamentable
than
that
poor
little
morsel
of
dead
flesh
lying
in
front
of
that
darkening
window
beneath
the
light
of
that
candle
but
once
more
an
indescribable
sound
that
was
neither
a
wail
nor
a
cry
nor
death
rattle
left
that
little
and
almost
bluish
mouth
together
with
a
little
whitish
froth
and
my
mother
as
if
insane
threw
herself
on
the
little
corpse
once
more
i
saw
all
that
with
my
eyes
closed
and
when
i
opened
my
eyes
i
saw
it
again
with
unbelievable
intensity
remove
that
candle
i
cried
to
federico
raising
myself
on
my
couch
terrified
by
the
mobility
of
the
little
pale
flame
remove
that
candle
federico
took
it
and
placed
it
behind
a
folding
screen
then
he
returned
to
my
bedside
made
me
lie
down
again
changed
the
cloth
on
my
forehead
at
moments
in
the
silence
i
heard
sighs
the
following
day
although
i
was
in
a
state
of
extreme
feebleness
and
prostration
i
wished
to
be
present
at
the
religious
benediction
at
the
funeral
procession
at
the
entire
ceremony
the
corpse
was
already
enclosed
in
its
little
white
coffin
with
a
glass
lid
a
crown
of
white
chrysanthemums
was
on
its
forehead
a
white
chrysanthemum
was
in
its
joined
hands
but
nothing
could
match
the
waxy
whiteness
of
those
diminutive
hands
the
nails
of
which
alone
were
violet
there
were
present
federico
giovanni
di
scordio
i
and
several
servants
the
four
tapers
burned
and
wept
the
priest
entered
attired
in
the
white
stole
followed
by
assistants
who
bore
the
aspergill
and
the
cross
we
all
knelt
the
priest
sprinkled
the
bier
with
holy
water
saying
nomen
then
he
recited
the
psalm
pueri
dominum
federico
and
giovanni
di
scordio
rose
and
took
the
coffin
pietro
opened
the
doors
in
front
of
them
i
followed
behind
me
came
the
priest
the
assistants
four
servants
with
lighted
wax
tapers
passing
through
the
silent
corridors
we
arrived
at
the
chapel
while
the
priest
recited
the
psalm
immaculati
while
the
bier
was
being
borne
into
the
chapel
the
priest
murmured
accipiet
benedictionem
a
federico
and
the
old
man
placed
the
bier
on
the
little
catafalque
in
the
middle
of
the
chapel
we
all
knelt
the
priest
recited
other
psalms
then
he
uttered
an
invocation
that
the
soul
of
the
innocent
be
called
to
heaven
then
he
again
sprinkled
the
bier
with
holy
water
then
he
went
out
followed
by
his
assistants
we
all
arose
everything
was
ready
for
the
burial
giovanni
di
scordio
took
the
light
coffin
in
his
arms
and
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
glass
lid
federico
descended
first
into
the
vault
and
the
old
man
descended
behind
him
bearing
the
coffin
i
descended
last
with
a
servant
nobody
spoke
the
sepulchral
chamber
was
large
all
of
gray
stone
in
the
walls
were
hollowed
out
niches
some
already
closed
by
stone
blocks
the
others
gaping
deep
full
of
darkness
waiting
for
their
prey
from
an
arch
hung
three
lamps
fed
with
olive
oil
and
they
burned
quietly
in
the
humid
and
heavy
air
with
small
thin
flames
that
were
never
extinguished
here
said
my
brother
and
he
pointed
to
an
open
niche
situated
beneath
another
niche
already
closed
by
a
stone
slab
on
that
stone
was
engraved
the
name
of
constance
from
the
gilt
letters
of
whose
name
came
confused
flashes
of
light
then
to
permit
us
to
contemplate
once
more
the
dead
child
giovanni
di
scordio
extended
the
arms
that
bore
the
coffin
and
we
gave
him
a
last
look
through
the
crystal
lid
that
little
livid
face
those
little
joined
hands
that
little
robe
and
those
chrysanthemums
and
all
those
white
things
appeared
infinitely
distant
intangible
as
if
the
transparent
lid
of
the
coffin
in
the
arms
of
that
grand
old
man
permitted
a
glimpse
through
some
cleft
of
a
supernatural
mystery
terrible
yet
full
of
a
sad
charm
no
one
spoke
it
seemed
as
if
no
one
breathed
the
old
man
turned
toward
the
mortuary
niche
bent
over
laid
the
coffin
on
the
ground
and
pushed
it
slowly
toward
the
end
then
he
knelt
down
and
remained
several
minutes
motionless
in
the
depths
the
coffin
stood
out
with
a
vague
whiteness
in
the
lamplight
the
hoary
head
of
the
old
man
seemed
luminous
thus
bent
on
the
border
of
the
shadow
