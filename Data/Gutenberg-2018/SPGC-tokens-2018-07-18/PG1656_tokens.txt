apology
by
plato
translated
by
benjamin
jowett
introduction
in
what
relation
the
apology
of
plato
stands
to
the
real
defence
of
socrates
there
are
no
means
of
determining
it
certainly
agrees
in
tone
and
character
with
the
description
of
xenophon
who
says
in
the
memorabilia
that
socrates
might
have
been
acquitted
in
any
moderate
degree
he
would
have
conciliated
the
favour
of
the
dicasts
and
who
informs
us
in
another
passage
on
the
testimony
of
hermogenes
the
friend
of
socrates
that
he
had
no
wish
to
live
and
that
the
divine
sign
refused
to
allow
him
to
prepare
a
defence
and
also
that
socrates
himself
declared
this
to
be
unnecessary
on
the
ground
that
all
his
life
long
he
had
been
preparing
against
that
hour
for
the
speech
breathes
throughout
a
spirit
of
defiance
ut
non
supplex
aut
reus
sed
magister
aut
dominus
videretur
esse
judicum
cic
de
orat
and
the
loose
and
desultory
style
is
an
imitation
of
the
manner
in
which
socrates
spoke
in
agora
and
among
the
tables
of
the
the
allusion
in
the
crito
may
perhaps
be
adduced
as
a
further
evidence
of
the
literal
accuracy
of
some
parts
but
in
the
main
it
must
be
regarded
as
the
ideal
of
socrates
according
to
conception
of
him
appearing
in
the
greatest
and
most
public
scene
of
his
life
and
in
the
height
of
his
triumph
when
he
is
weakest
and
yet
his
mastery
over
mankind
is
greatest
and
his
habitual
irony
acquires
a
new
meaning
and
a
sort
of
tragic
pathos
in
the
face
of
death
the
facts
of
his
life
are
summed
up
and
the
features
of
his
character
are
brought
out
as
if
by
accident
in
the
course
of
the
defence
the
conversational
manner
the
seeming
want
of
arrangement
the
ironical
simplicity
are
found
to
result
in
a
perfect
work
of
art
which
is
the
portrait
of
socrates
yet
some
of
the
topics
may
have
been
actually
used
by
socrates
and
the
recollection
of
his
very
words
may
have
rung
in
the
ears
of
his
disciple
the
apology
of
plato
may
be
compared
generally
with
those
speeches
of
thucydides
in
which
he
has
embodied
his
conception
of
the
lofty
character
and
policy
of
the
great
pericles
and
which
at
the
same
time
furnish
a
commentary
on
the
situation
of
affairs
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
historian
so
in
the
apology
there
is
an
ideal
rather
than
a
literal
truth
much
is
said
which
was
not
said
and
is
only
plato
view
of
the
situation
plato
was
not
like
xenophon
a
chronicler
of
facts
he
does
not
appear
in
any
of
his
writings
to
have
aimed
at
literal
accuracy
he
is
not
therefore
to
be
supplemented
from
the
memorabilia
and
symposium
of
xenophon
who
belongs
to
an
entirely
different
class
of
writers
the
apology
of
plato
is
not
the
report
of
what
socrates
said
but
an
elaborate
composition
quite
as
much
so
in
fact
as
one
of
the
dialogues
and
we
may
perhaps
even
indulge
in
the
fancy
that
the
actual
defence
of
socrates
was
as
much
greater
than
the
platonic
defence
as
the
master
was
greater
than
the
disciple
but
in
any
case
some
of
the
words
used
by
him
must
have
been
remembered
and
some
of
the
facts
recorded
must
have
actually
occurred
it
is
significant
that
plato
is
said
to
have
been
present
at
the
defence
apol
as
he
is
also
said
to
have
been
absent
at
the
last
scene
in
the
phaedo
is
it
fanciful
to
suppose
that
he
meant
to
give
the
stamp
of
authenticity
to
the
one
and
not
to
the
other
especially
when
we
consider
that
these
two
passages
are
the
only
ones
in
which
plato
makes
mention
of
himself
the
circumstance
that
plato
was
to
be
one
of
his
sureties
for
the
payment
of
the
fine
which
he
proposed
has
the
appearance
of
truth
more
suspicious
is
the
statement
that
socrates
received
the
first
impulse
to
his
favourite
calling
of
the
world
from
the
oracle
of
delphi
for
he
must
already
have
been
famous
before
chaerephon
went
to
consult
the
oracle
riddell
and
the
story
is
of
a
kind
which
is
very
likely
to
have
been
invented
on
the
whole
we
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
the
apology
is
true
to
the
character
of
socrates
but
we
can
not
show
that
any
single
sentence
in
it
was
actually
spoken
by
him
it
breathes
the
spirit
of
socrates
but
has
been
cast
anew
in
the
mould
of
plato
there
is
not
much
in
the
other
dialogues
which
can
be
compared
with
the
apology
the
same
recollection
of
his
master
may
have
been
present
to
the
mind
of
plato
when
depicting
the
sufferings
of
the
just
in
the
republic
the
crito
may
also
be
regarded
as
a
sort
of
appendage
to
the
apology
in
which
socrates
who
has
defied
the
judges
is
nevertheless
represented
as
scrupulously
obedient
to
the
laws
the
idealization
of
the
sufferer
is
carried
still
further
in
the
gorgias
in
which
the
thesis
is
maintained
that
suffer
is
better
than
to
do
evil
and
the
art
of
rhetoric
is
described
as
only
useful
for
the
purpose
of
the
parallelisms
which
occur
in
the
apology
of
xenophon
are
not
worth
noticing
because
the
writing
in
which
they
are
contained
is
manifestly
spurious
the
statements
of
the
memorabilia
respecting
the
trial
and
death
of
socrates
agree
generally
with
plato
but
they
have
lost
the
flavour
of
socratic
irony
in
the
narrative
of
xenophon
the
apology
or
platonic
defence
of
socrates
is
divided
into
three
parts
the
defence
properly
so
called
the
shorter
address
in
mitigation
of
the
penalty
the
last
words
of
prophetic
rebuke
and
exhortation
the
first
part
commences
with
an
apology
for
his
colloquial
style
he
is
as
he
has
always
been
the
enemy
of
rhetoric
and
knows
of
no
rhetoric
but
truth
he
will
not
falsify
his
character
by
making
a
speech
then
he
proceeds
to
divide
his
accusers
into
two
classes
first
there
is
the
nameless
accuser
public
opinion
all
the
world
from
their
earliest
years
had
heard
that
he
was
a
corrupter
of
youth
and
had
seen
him
caricatured
in
the
clouds
of
aristophanes
secondly
there
are
the
professed
accusers
who
are
but
the
of
the
others
the
accusations
of
both
might
be
summed
up
in
a
formula
the
first
say
is
an
and
a
curious
person
searching
into
things
under
the
earth
and
above
the
heaven
and
making
the
worse
appear
the
better
cause
and
teaching
all
this
to
others
the
second
is
an
and
corrupter
of
the
youth
who
does
not
receive
the
gods
whom
the
state
receives
but
introduces
other
new
divinities
these
last
words
appear
to
have
been
the
actual
indictment
compare
xen
mem
and
the
previous
formula
which
is
a
summary
of
public
opinion
assumes
the
same
legal
style
the
answer
begins
by
clearing
up
a
confusion
in
the
representations
of
the
comic
poets
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
multitude
he
had
been
identified
with
the
teachers
of
physical
science
and
with
the
sophists
but
this
was
an
error
for
both
of
them
he
professes
a
respect
in
the
open
court
which
contrasts
with
his
manner
of
speaking
about
them
in
other
places
compare
for
anaxagoras
phaedo
laws
for
the
sophists
meno
republic
etc
but
at
the
same
time
he
shows
that
he
is
not
one
of
them
of
natural
philosophy
he
knows
nothing
not
that
he
despises
such
pursuits
but
the
fact
is
that
he
is
ignorant
of
them
and
never
says
a
word
about
them
nor
is
he
paid
for
giving
instruction
that
is
another
mistaken
notion
he
has
nothing
to
teach
but
he
commends
evenus
for
teaching
virtue
at
such
a
rate
as
five
minae
something
of
the
irony
which
may
perhaps
be
expected
to
sleep
in
the
ear
of
the
multitude
is
lurking
here
he
then
goes
on
to
explain
the
reason
why
he
is
in
such
an
evil
name
that
had
arisen
out
of
a
peculiar
mission
which
he
had
taken
upon
himself
the
enthusiastic
chaerephon
probably
in
anticipation
of
the
answer
which
he
received
had
gone
to
delphi
and
asked
the
oracle
if
there
was
any
man
wiser
than
socrates
and
the
answer
was
that
there
was
no
man
wiser
what
could
be
the
meaning
of
this
that
he
who
knew
nothing
and
knew
that
he
knew
nothing
should
be
declared
by
the
oracle
to
be
the
wisest
of
men
reflecting
upon
the
answer
he
determined
to
refute
it
by
finding
wiser
and
first
he
went
to
the
politicians
and
then
to
the
poets
and
then
to
the
craftsmen
but
always
with
the
same
result
he
found
that
they
knew
nothing
or
hardly
anything
more
than
himself
and
that
the
little
advantage
which
in
some
cases
they
possessed
was
more
than
by
their
conceit
of
knowledge
he
knew
nothing
and
knew
that
he
knew
nothing
they
knew
little
or
nothing
and
imagined
that
they
knew
all
things
thus
he
had
passed
his
life
as
a
sort
of
missionary
in
detecting
the
pretended
wisdom
of
mankind
and
this
occupation
had
quite
absorbed
him
and
taken
him
away
both
from
public
and
private
affairs
young
men
of
the
richer
sort
had
made
a
pastime
of
the
same
pursuit
was
not
unamusing
and
hence
bitter
enmities
had
arisen
the
professors
of
knowledge
had
revenged
themselves
by
calling
him
a
villainous
corrupter
of
youth
and
by
repeating
the
commonplaces
about
atheism
and
materialism
and
sophistry
which
are
the
against
all
philosophers
when
there
is
nothing
else
to
be
said
of
them
the
second
accusation
he
meets
by
interrogating
meletus
who
is
present
and
can
be
interrogated
he
is
the
corrupter
who
is
the
improver
of
the
citizens
compare
meno
men
everywhere
but
how
absurd
how
contrary
to
analogy
is
this
how
inconceivable
too
that
he
should
make
the
citizens
worse
when
he
has
to
live
with
them
this
surely
can
not
be
intentional
and
if
unintentional
he
ought
to
have
been
instructed
by
meletus
and
not
accused
in
the
court
but
there
is
another
part
of
the
indictment
which
says
that
he
teaches
men
not
to
receive
the
gods
whom
the
city
receives
and
has
other
new
gods
that
the
way
in
which
he
is
supposed
to
corrupt
the
youth
it
is
he
only
new
gods
or
none
at
all
at
all
not
even
the
sun
and
moon
why
he
says
that
the
sun
is
a
stone
and
the
moon
earth
that
replies
socrates
is
the
old
confusion
about
anaxagoras
the
athenian
people
are
not
so
ignorant
as
to
attribute
to
the
influence
of
socrates
notions
which
have
found
their
way
into
the
drama
and
may
be
learned
at
the
theatre
socrates
undertakes
to
show
that
meletus
rather
unjustifiably
has
been
compounding
a
riddle
in
this
part
of
the
indictment
are
no
gods
but
socrates
believes
in
the
existence
of
the
sons
of
gods
which
is
absurd
leaving
meletus
who
has
had
enough
words
spent
upon
him
he
returns
to
the
original
accusation
the
question
may
be
asked
why
will
he
persist
in
following
a
profession
which
leads
him
to
death
why
because
he
must
remain
at
his
post
where
the
god
has
placed
him
as
he
remained
at
potidaea
and
amphipolis
and
delium
where
the
generals
placed
him
besides
he
is
not
so
overwise
as
to
imagine
that
he
knows
whether
death
is
a
good
or
an
evil
and
he
is
certain
that
desertion
of
his
duty
is
an
evil
anytus
is
quite
right
in
saying
that
they
should
never
have
indicted
him
if
they
meant
to
let
him
go
for
he
will
certainly
obey
god
rather
than
man
and
will
continue
to
preach
to
all
men
of
all
ages
the
necessity
of
virtue
and
improvement
and
if
they
refuse
to
listen
to
him
he
will
still
persevere
and
reprove
them
this
is
his
way
of
corrupting
the
youth
which
he
will
not
cease
to
follow
in
obedience
to
the
god
even
if
a
thousand
deaths
await
him
he
is
desirous
that
they
should
let
him
live
not
for
his
own
sake
but
for
theirs
because
he
is
their
friend
and
they
will
never
have
such
another
or
as
he
may
be
ludicrously
described
he
is
the
gadfly
who
stirs
the
generous
steed
into
motion
why
then
has
he
never
taken
part
in
public
affairs
because
the
familiar
divine
voice
has
hindered
him
if
he
had
been
a
public
man
and
had
fought
for
the
right
as
he
would
certainly
have
fought
against
the
many
he
would
not
have
lived
and
could
therefore
have
done
no
good
twice
in
public
matters
he
has
risked
his
life
for
the
sake
of
justice
once
at
the
trial
of
the
generals
and
again
in
resistance
to
the
tyrannical
commands
of
the
thirty
but
though
not
a
public
man
he
has
passed
his
days
in
instructing
the
citizens
without
fee
or
reward
this
was
his
mission
whether
his
disciples
have
turned
out
well
or
ill
he
can
not
justly
be
charged
with
the
result
for
he
never
promised
to
teach
them
anything
they
might
come
if
they
liked
and
they
might
stay
away
if
they
liked
and
they
did
come
because
they
found
an
amusement
in
hearing
the
pretenders
to
wisdom
detected
if
they
have
been
corrupted
their
elder
relatives
if
not
themselves
might
surely
come
into
court
and
witness
against
him
and
there
is
an
opportunity
still
for
them
to
appear
but
their
fathers
and
brothers
all
appear
in
court
including
plato
to
witness
on
his
behalf
and
if
their
relatives
are
corrupted
at
least
they
are
uncorrupted
they
are
my
witnesses
for
they
know
that
i
am
speaking
the
truth
and
that
meletus
is
lying
this
is
about
all
that
he
has
to
say
he
will
not
entreat
the
judges
to
spare
his
life
neither
will
he
present
a
spectacle
of
weeping
children
although
he
too
is
not
made
of
or
oak
some
of
the
judges
themselves
may
have
complied
with
this
practice
on
similar
occasions
and
he
trusts
that
they
will
not
be
angry
with
him
for
not
following
their
example
but
he
feels
that
such
conduct
brings
discredit
on
the
name
of
athens
he
feels
too
that
the
judge
has
sworn
not
to
give
away
justice
and
he
can
not
be
guilty
of
the
impiety
of
asking
the
judge
to
break
his
oath
when
he
is
himself
being
tried
for
impiety
as
he
expected
and
probably
intended
he
is
convicted
and
now
the
tone
of
the
speech
instead
of
being
more
conciliatory
becomes
more
lofty
and
commanding
anytus
proposes
death
as
the
penalty
and
what
shall
he
make
he
the
benefactor
of
the
athenian
people
whose
whole
life
has
been
spent
in
doing
them
good
should
at
least
have
the
olympic
victor
reward
of
maintenance
in
the
prytaneum
or
why
should
he
propose
any
when
he
does
not
know
whether
death
which
anytus
proposes
is
a
good
or
an
evil
and
he
is
certain
that
imprisonment
is
an
evil
exile
is
an
evil
loss
of
money
might
be
an
evil
but
then
he
has
none
to
give
perhaps
he
can
make
up
a
mina
let
that
be
the
penalty
or
if
his
friends
wish
thirty
minae
for
which
they
will
be
excellent
securities
he
is
condemned
to
death
he
is
an
old
man
already
and
the
athenians
will
gain
nothing
but
disgrace
by
depriving
him
of
a
few
years
of
life
perhaps
he
could
have
escaped
if
he
had
chosen
to
throw
down
his
arms
and
entreat
for
his
life
but
he
does
not
at
all
repent
of
the
manner
of
his
defence
he
would
rather
die
in
his
own
fashion
than
live
in
theirs
for
the
penalty
of
unrighteousness
is
swifter
than
death
that
penalty
has
already
overtaken
his
accusers
as
death
will
soon
overtake
him
and
now
as
one
who
is
about
to
die
he
will
prophesy
to
them
they
have
put
him
to
death
in
order
to
escape
the
necessity
of
giving
an
account
of
their
lives
but
his
death
be
the
seed
of
many
disciples
who
will
convince
them
of
their
evil
ways
and
will
come
forth
to
reprove
them
in
harsher
terms
because
they
are
younger
and
more
inconsiderate
he
would
like
to
say
a
few
words
while
there
is
time
to
those
who
would
have
acquitted
him
he
wishes
them
to
know
that
the
divine
sign
never
interrupted
him
in
the
course
of
his
defence
the
reason
of
which
as
he
conjectures
is
that
the
death
to
which
he
is
going
is
a
good
and
not
an
evil
for
either
death
is
a
long
sleep
the
best
of
sleeps
or
a
journey
to
another
world
in
which
the
souls
of
the
dead
are
gathered
together
and
in
which
there
may
be
a
hope
of
seeing
the
heroes
of
old
in
which
too
there
are
just
judges
and
as
all
are
immortal
there
can
be
no
fear
of
any
one
suffering
death
for
his
opinions
nothing
evil
can
happen
to
the
good
man
either
in
life
or
death
and
his
own
death
has
been
permitted
by
the
gods
because
it
was
better
for
him
to
depart
and
therefore
he
forgives
his
judges
because
they
have
done
him
no
harm
although
they
never
meant
to
do
him
any
good
he
has
a
last
request
to
make
to
them
that
they
will
trouble
his
sons
as
he
has
troubled
them
if
they
appear
to
prefer
riches
to
virtue
or
to
think
themselves
something
when
they
are
nothing
persons
will
be
found
to
wish
that
socrates
should
have
defended
himself
otherwise
if
as
we
must
add
his
defence
was
that
with
which
plato
has
provided
him
but
leaving
this
question
which
does
not
admit
of
a
precise
solution
we
may
go
on
to
ask
what
was
the
impression
which
plato
in
the
apology
intended
to
give
of
the
character
and
conduct
of
his
master
in
the
last
great
scene
did
he
intend
to
represent
him
as
employing
sophistries
as
designedly
irritating
the
judges
or
are
these
sophistries
to
be
regarded
as
belonging
to
the
age
in
which
he
lived
and
to
his
personal
character
and
this
apparent
haughtiness
as
flowing
from
the
natural
elevation
of
his
position
for
example
when
he
says
that
it
is
absurd
to
suppose
that
one
man
is
the
corrupter
and
all
the
rest
of
the
world
the
improvers
of
the
youth
or
when
he
argues
that
he
never
could
have
corrupted
the
men
with
whom
he
had
to
live
or
when
he
proves
his
belief
in
the
gods
because
he
believes
in
the
sons
of
gods
is
he
serious
or
jesting
it
may
be
observed
that
these
sophisms
all
occur
in
his
of
meletus
who
is
easily
foiled
and
mastered
in
the
hands
of
the
great
dialectician
perhaps
he
regarded
these
answers
as
good
enough
for
his
accuser
of
whom
he
makes
very
light
also
there
is
a
touch
of
irony
in
them
which
takes
them
out
of
the
category
of
sophistry
compare
euthyph
that
the
manner
in
which
he
defends
himself
about
the
lives
of
his
disciples
is
not
satisfactory
can
hardly
be
denied
fresh
in
the
memory
of
the
athenians
and
detestable
as
they
deserved
to
be
to
the
newly
restored
democracy
were
the
names
of
alcibiades
critias
charmides
it
is
obviously
not
a
sufficient
answer
that
socrates
had
never
professed
to
teach
them
anything
and
is
therefore
not
justly
chargeable
with
their
crimes
yet
the
defence
when
taken
out
of
this
ironical
form
is
doubtless
sound
that
his
teaching
had
nothing
to
do
with
their
evil
lives
here
then
the
sophistry
is
rather
in
form
than
in
substance
though
we
might
desire
that
to
such
a
serious
charge
socrates
had
given
a
more
serious
answer
truly
characteristic
of
socrates
is
another
point
in
his
answer
which
may
also
be
regarded
as
sophistical
he
says
that
he
has
corrupted
the
youth
he
must
have
corrupted
them
involuntarily
but
if
as
socrates
argues
all
evil
is
involuntary
then
all
criminals
ought
to
be
admonished
and
not
punished
in
these
words
the
socratic
doctrine
of
the
involuntariness
of
evil
is
clearly
intended
to
be
conveyed
here
again
as
in
the
former
instance
the
defence
of
socrates
is
untrue
practically
but
may
be
true
in
some
ideal
or
transcendental
sense
the
commonplace
reply
that
if
he
had
been
guilty
of
corrupting
the
youth
their
relations
would
surely
have
witnessed
against
him
with
which
he
concludes
this
part
of
his
defence
is
more
satisfactory
again
when
socrates
argues
that
he
must
believe
in
the
gods
because
he
believes
in
the
sons
of
gods
we
must
remember
that
this
is
a
refutation
not
of
the
original
indictment
which
is
consistent
enough
does
not
receive
the
gods
whom
the
city
receives
and
has
other
new
divinities
but
of
the
interpretation
put
upon
the
words
by
meletus
who
has
affirmed
that
he
is
a
downright
atheist
to
this
socrates
fairly
answers
in
accordance
with
the
ideas
of
the
time
that
a
downright
atheist
can
not
believe
in
the
sons
of
gods
or
in
divine
things
the
notion
that
demons
or
lesser
divinities
are
the
sons
of
gods
is
not
to
be
regarded
as
ironical
or
sceptical
he
is
arguing
according
to
the
notions
of
mythology
current
in
his
age
yet
he
abstains
from
saying
that
he
believed
in
the
gods
whom
the
state
approved
he
does
not
defend
himself
as
xenophon
has
defended
him
by
appealing
to
his
practice
of
religion
probably
he
neither
wholly
believed
nor
disbelieved
in
the
existence
of
the
popular
gods
he
had
no
means
of
knowing
about
them
according
to
plato
compare
phaedo
symp
as
well
as
xenophon
memor
he
was
punctual
in
the
performance
of
the
least
religious
duties
and
he
must
have
believed
in
his
own
oracular
sign
of
which
he
seemed
to
have
an
internal
witness
but
the
existence
of
apollo
or
zeus
or
the
other
gods
whom
the
state
approves
would
have
appeared
to
him
both
uncertain
and
unimportant
in
comparison
of
the
duty
of
and
of
those
principles
of
truth
and
right
which
he
deemed
to
be
the
foundation
of
religion
compare
phaedr
euthyph
republic
the
second
question
whether
plato
meant
to
represent
socrates
as
braving
or
irritating
his
judges
must
also
be
answered
in
the
negative
his
irony
his
superiority
his
audacity
not
the
person
of
man
necessarily
flow
out
of
the
loftiness
of
his
situation
he
is
not
acting
a
part
upon
a
great
occasion
but
he
is
what
he
has
been
all
his
life
long
king
of
men
he
would
rather
not
appear
insolent
if
he
could
avoid
it
ouch
os
authadizomenos
touto
lego
neither
is
he
desirous
of
hastening
his
own
end
for
life
and
death
are
simply
indifferent
to
him
but
such
a
defence
as
would
be
acceptable
to
his
judges
and
might
procure
an
acquittal
it
is
not
in
his
nature
to
make
he
will
not
say
or
do
anything
that
might
pervert
the
course
of
justice
he
can
not
have
his
tongue
bound
even
the
throat
of
death
with
his
accusers
he
will
only
fence
and
play
as
he
had
fenced
with
other
of
youth
answering
the
sophist
according
to
his
sophistry
all
his
life
long
he
is
serious
when
he
is
speaking
of
his
own
mission
which
seems
to
distinguish
him
from
all
other
reformers
of
mankind
and
originates
in
an
accident
the
dedication
of
himself
to
the
improvement
of
his
is
not
so
remarkable
as
the
ironical
spirit
in
which
he
goes
about
doing
good
only
in
vindication
of
the
credit
of
the
oracle
and
in
the
vain
hope
of
finding
a
wiser
man
than
himself
yet
this
singular
and
almost
accidental
character
of
his
mission
agrees
with
the
divine
sign
which
according
to
our
notions
is
equally
accidental
and
irrational
and
is
nevertheless
accepted
by
him
as
the
guiding
principle
of
his
life
socrates
is
nowhere
represented
to
us
as
a
freethinker
or
sceptic
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
his
sincerity
when
he
speculates
on
the
possibility
of
seeing
and
knowing
the
heroes
of
the
trojan
war
in
another
world
on
the
other
hand
his
hope
of
immortality
is
uncertain
he
also
conceives
of
death
as
a
long
sleep
in
this
respect
differing
from
the
phaedo
and
at
last
falls
back
on
resignation
to
the
divine
will
and
the
certainty
that
no
evil
can
happen
to
the
good
man
either
in
life
or
death
his
absolute
truthfulness
seems
to
hinder
him
from
asserting
positively
more
than
this
and
he
makes
no
attempt
to
veil
his
ignorance
in
mythology
and
figures
of
speech
the
gentleness
of
the
first
part
of
the
speech
contrasts
with
the
aggravated
almost
threatening
tone
of
the
conclusion
he
characteristically
remarks
that
he
will
not
speak
as
a
rhetorician
that
is
to
say
he
will
not
make
a
regular
defence
such
as
lysias
or
one
of
the
orators
might
have
composed
for
him
or
according
to
some
accounts
did
compose
for
him
but
he
first
procures
himself
a
hearing
by
conciliatory
words
he
does
not
attack
the
sophists
for
they
were
open
to
the
same
charges
as
himself
they
were
equally
ridiculed
by
the
comic
poets
and
almost
equally
hateful
to
anytus
and
meletus
yet
incidentally
the
antagonism
between
socrates
and
the
sophists
is
allowed
to
appear
he
is
poor
and
they
are
rich
his
profession
that
he
teaches
nothing
is
opposed
to
their
readiness
to
teach
all
things
his
talking
in
the
marketplace
to
their
private
instructions
his
life
to
their
wandering
from
city
to
city
the
tone
which
he
assumes
towards
them
is
one
of
real
friendliness
but
also
of
concealed
irony
towards
anaxagoras
who
had
disappointed
him
in
his
hopes
of
learning
about
mind
and
nature
he
shows
a
less
kindly
feeling
which
is
also
the
feeling
of
plato
in
other
passages
laws
but
anaxagoras
had
been
dead
thirty
years
and
was
beyond
the
reach
of
persecution
it
has
been
remarked
that
the
prophecy
of
a
new
generation
of
teachers
who
would
rebuke
and
exhort
the
athenian
people
in
harsher
and
more
violent
terms
was
as
far
as
we
know
never
fulfilled
no
inference
can
be
drawn
from
this
circumstance
as
to
the
probability
of
the
words
attributed
to
him
having
been
actually
uttered
they
express
the
aspiration
of
the
first
martyr
of
philosophy
that
he
would
leave
behind
him
many
followers
accompanied
by
the
not
unnatural
feeling
that
they
would
be
fiercer
and
more
inconsiderate
in
their
words
when
emancipated
from
his
control
the
above
remarks
must
be
understood
as
applying
with
any
degree
of
certainty
to
the
platonic
socrates
only
for
although
these
or
similar
words
may
have
been
spoken
by
socrates
himself
we
can
not
exclude
the
possibility
that
like
so
much
else
the
wisdom
of
critias
the
poem
of
solon
the
virtues
of
charmides
they
may
have
been
due
only
to
the
imagination
of
plato
the
arguments
of
those
who
maintain
that
the
apology
was
composed
during
the
process
resting
on
no
evidence
do
not
require
a
serious
refutation
nor
are
the
reasonings
of
schleiermacher
who
argues
that
the
platonic
defence
is
an
exact
or
nearly
exact
reproduction
of
the
words
of
socrates
partly
because
plato
would
not
have
been
guilty
of
the
impiety
of
altering
them
and
also
because
many
points
of
the
defence
might
have
been
improved
and
strengthened
at
all
more
conclusive
see
english
translation
what
effect
the
death
of
socrates
produced
on
the
mind
of
plato
we
can
not
certainly
determine
nor
can
we
say
how
he
would
or
must
have
written
under
the
circumstances
we
observe
that
the
enmity
of
aristophanes
to
socrates
does
not
prevent
plato
from
introducing
them
together
in
the
symposium
engaged
in
friendly
intercourse
nor
is
there
any
trace
in
the
dialogues
of
an
attempt
to
make
anytus
or
meletus
personally
odious
in
the
eyes
of
the
athenian
public
apology
how
you
o
athenians
have
been
affected
by
my
accusers
i
can
not
tell
but
i
know
that
they
almost
made
me
forget
who
i
was
so
persuasively
did
they
speak
and
yet
they
have
hardly
uttered
a
word
of
truth
but
of
the
many
falsehoods
told
by
them
there
was
one
which
quite
amazed
me
i
mean
when
they
said
that
you
should
be
upon
your
guard
and
not
allow
yourselves
to
be
deceived
by
the
force
of
my
eloquence
to
say
this
when
they
were
certain
to
be
detected
as
soon
as
i
opened
my
lips
and
proved
myself
to
be
anything
but
a
great
speaker
did
indeed
appear
to
me
most
shameless
unless
by
the
force
of
eloquence
they
mean
the
force
of
truth
for
it
such
is
their
meaning
i
admit
that
i
am
eloquent
but
in
how
different
a
way
from
theirs
well
as
i
was
saying
they
have
scarcely
spoken
the
truth
at
all
but
from
me
you
shall
hear
the
whole
truth
not
however
delivered
after
their
manner
in
a
set
oration
duly
ornamented
with
words
and
phrases
no
by
heaven
but
i
shall
use
the
words
and
arguments
which
occur
to
me
at
the
moment
for
i
am
confident
in
the
justice
of
my
cause
or
i
am
certain
that
i
am
right
in
taking
this
course
at
my
time
of
life
i
ought
not
to
be
appearing
before
you
o
men
of
athens
in
the
character
of
a
juvenile
orator
let
no
one
expect
it
of
me
and
i
must
beg
of
you
to
grant
me
a
favour
if
i
defend
myself
in
my
accustomed
manner
and
you
hear
me
using
the
words
which
i
have
been
in
the
habit
of
using
in
the
agora
at
the
tables
of
the
or
anywhere
else
i
would
ask
you
not
to
be
surprised
and
not
to
interrupt
me
on
this
account
for
i
am
more
than
seventy
years
of
age
and
appearing
now
for
the
first
time
in
a
court
of
law
i
am
quite
a
stranger
to
the
language
of
the
place
and
therefore
i
would
have
you
regard
me
as
if
i
were
really
a
stranger
whom
you
would
excuse
if
he
spoke
in
his
native
tongue
and
after
the
fashion
of
his
country
am
i
making
an
unfair
request
of
you
never
mind
the
manner
which
may
or
may
not
be
good
but
think
only
of
the
truth
of
my
words
and
give
heed
to
that
let
the
speaker
speak
truly
and
the
judge
decide
justly
and
first
i
have
to
reply
to
the
older
charges
and
to
my
first
accusers
and
then
i
will
go
on
to
the
later
ones
for
of
old
i
have
had
many
accusers
who
have
accused
me
falsely
to
you
during
many
years
and
i
am
more
afraid
of
them
than
of
anytus
and
his
associates
who
are
dangerous
too
in
their
own
way
but
far
more
dangerous
are
the
others
who
began
when
you
were
children
and
took
possession
of
your
minds
with
their
falsehoods
telling
of
one
socrates
a
wise
man
who
speculated
about
the
heaven
above
and
searched
into
the
earth
beneath
and
made
the
worse
appear
the
better
cause
the
disseminators
of
this
tale
are
the
accusers
whom
i
dread
for
their
hearers
are
apt
to
fancy
that
such
enquirers
do
not
believe
in
the
existence
of
the
gods
and
they
are
many
and
their
charges
against
me
are
of
ancient
date
and
they
were
made
by
them
in
the
days
when
you
were
more
impressible
than
you
are
now
in
childhood
or
it
may
have
been
in
youth
and
the
cause
when
heard
went
by
default
for
there
was
none
to
answer
and
hardest
of
all
i
do
not
know
and
can
not
tell
the
names
of
my
accusers
unless
in
the
chance
case
of
a
comic
poet
all
who
from
envy
and
malice
have
persuaded
you
some
of
them
having
first
convinced
themselves
all
this
class
of
men
are
most
difficult
to
deal
with
for
i
can
not
have
them
up
here
and
them
and
therefore
i
must
simply
fight
with
shadows
in
my
own
defence
and
argue
when
there
is
no
one
who
answers
i
will
ask
you
then
to
assume
with
me
as
i
was
saying
that
my
opponents
are
of
two
kinds
one
recent
the
other
ancient
and
i
hope
that
you
will
see
the
propriety
of
my
answering
the
latter
first
for
these
accusations
you
heard
long
before
the
others
and
much
oftener
well
then
i
must
make
my
defence
and
endeavour
to
clear
away
in
a
short
time
a
slander
which
has
lasted
a
long
time
may
i
succeed
if
to
succeed
be
for
my
good
and
yours
or
likely
to
avail
me
in
my
cause
the
task
is
not
an
easy
one
i
quite
understand
the
nature
of
it
and
so
leaving
the
event
with
god
in
obedience
to
the
law
i
will
now
make
my
defence
i
will
begin
at
the
beginning
and
ask
what
is
the
accusation
which
has
given
rise
to
the
slander
of
me
and
in
fact
has
encouraged
meletus
to
proof
this
charge
against
me
well
what
do
the
slanderers
say
they
shall
be
my
prosecutors
and
i
will
sum
up
their
words
in
an
affidavit
is
an
and
a
curious
person
who
searches
into
things
under
the
earth
and
in
heaven
and
he
makes
the
worse
appear
the
better
cause
and
he
teaches
the
aforesaid
doctrines
to
others
such
is
the
nature
of
the
accusation
it
is
just
what
you
have
yourselves
seen
in
the
comedy
of
aristophanes
clouds
who
has
introduced
a
man
whom
he
calls
socrates
going
about
and
saying
that
he
walks
in
air
and
talking
a
deal
of
nonsense
concerning
matters
of
which
i
do
not
pretend
to
know
either
much
or
little
not
that
i
mean
to
speak
disparagingly
of
any
one
who
is
a
student
of
natural
philosophy
i
should
be
very
sorry
if
meletus
could
bring
so
grave
a
charge
against
me
but
the
simple
truth
is
o
athenians
that
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
physical
speculations
very
many
of
those
here
present
are
witnesses
to
the
truth
of
this
and
to
them
i
appeal
speak
then
you
who
have
heard
me
and
tell
your
neighbours
whether
any
of
you
have
ever
known
me
hold
forth
in
few
words
or
in
many
upon
such
matters
you
hear
their
answer
and
from
what
they
say
of
this
part
of
the
charge
you
will
be
able
to
judge
of
the
truth
of
the
rest
as
little
foundation
is
there
for
the
report
that
i
am
a
teacher
and
take
money
this
accusation
has
no
more
truth
in
it
than
the
other
although
if
a
man
were
really
able
to
instruct
mankind
to
receive
money
for
giving
instruction
would
in
my
opinion
be
an
honour
to
him
there
is
gorgias
of
leontium
and
prodicus
of
ceos
and
hippias
of
elis
who
go
the
round
of
the
cities
and
are
able
to
persuade
the
young
men
to
leave
their
own
citizens
by
whom
they
might
be
taught
for
nothing
and
come
to
them
whom
they
not
only
pay
but
are
thankful
if
they
may
be
allowed
to
pay
them
there
is
at
this
time
a
parian
philosopher
residing
in
athens
of
whom
i
have
heard
and
i
came
to
hear
of
him
in
this
way
i
came
across
a
man
who
has
spent
a
world
of
money
on
the
sophists
callias
the
son
of
hipponicus
and
knowing
that
he
had
sons
i
asked
him
i
said
your
two
sons
were
foals
or
calves
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
finding
some
one
to
put
over
them
we
should
hire
a
trainer
of
horses
or
a
farmer
probably
who
would
improve
and
perfect
them
in
their
own
proper
virtue
and
excellence
but
as
they
are
human
beings
whom
are
you
thinking
of
placing
over
them
is
there
any
one
who
understands
human
and
political
virtue
you
must
have
thought
about
the
matter
for
you
have
sons
is
there
any
one
is
he
said
is
he
said
i
of
what
country
and
what
does
he
charge
the
parian
he
replied
is
the
man
and
his
charge
is
five
minae
happy
is
evenus
i
said
to
myself
if
he
really
has
this
wisdom
and
teaches
at
such
a
moderate
charge
had
i
the
same
i
should
have
been
very
proud
and
conceited
but
the
truth
is
that
i
have
no
knowledge
of
the
kind
i
dare
say
athenians
that
some
one
among
you
will
reply
socrates
but
what
is
the
origin
of
these
accusations
which
are
brought
against
you
there
must
have
been
something
strange
which
you
have
been
doing
all
these
rumours
and
this
talk
about
you
would
never
have
arisen
if
you
had
been
like
other
men
tell
us
then
what
is
the
cause
of
them
for
we
should
be
sorry
to
judge
hastily
of
you
now
i
regard
this
as
a
fair
challenge
and
i
will
endeavour
to
explain
to
you
the
reason
why
i
am
called
wise
and
have
such
an
evil
fame
please
to
attend
then
and
although
some
of
you
may
think
that
i
am
joking
i
declare
that
i
will
tell
you
the
entire
truth
men
of
athens
this
reputation
of
mine
has
come
of
a
certain
sort
of
wisdom
which
i
possess
if
you
ask
me
what
kind
of
wisdom
i
reply
wisdom
such
as
may
perhaps
be
attained
by
man
for
to
that
extent
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
i
am
wise
whereas
the
persons
of
whom
i
was
speaking
have
a
superhuman
wisdom
which
i
may
fail
to
describe
because
i
have
it
not
myself
and
he
who
says
that
i
have
speaks
falsely
and
is
taking
away
my
character
and
here
o
men
of
athens
i
must
beg
you
not
to
interrupt
me
even
if
i
seem
to
say
something
extravagant
for
the
word
which
i
will
speak
is
not
mine
i
will
refer
you
to
a
witness
who
is
worthy
of
credit
that
witness
shall
be
the
god
of
delphi
he
will
tell
you
about
my
wisdom
if
i
have
any
and
of
what
sort
it
is
you
must
have
known
chaerephon
he
was
early
a
friend
of
mine
and
also
a
friend
of
yours
for
he
shared
in
the
recent
exile
of
the
people
and
returned
with
you
well
chaerephon
as
you
know
was
very
impetuous
in
all
his
doings
and
he
went
to
delphi
and
boldly
asked
the
oracle
to
tell
him
whether
as
i
was
saying
i
must
beg
you
not
to
interrupt
he
asked
the
oracle
to
tell
him
whether
anyone
was
wiser
than
i
was
and
the
pythian
prophetess
answered
that
there
was
no
man
wiser
chaerephon
is
dead
himself
but
his
brother
who
is
in
court
will
confirm
the
truth
of
what
i
am
saying
why
do
i
mention
this
because
i
am
going
to
explain
to
you
why
i
have
such
an
evil
name
when
i
heard
the
answer
i
said
to
myself
what
can
the
god
mean
and
what
is
the
interpretation
of
his
riddle
for
i
know
that
i
have
no
wisdom
small
or
great
what
then
can
he
mean
when
he
says
that
i
am
the
wisest
of
men
and
yet
he
is
a
god
and
can
not
lie
that
would
be
against
his
nature
after
long
consideration
i
thought
of
a
method
of
trying
the
question
i
reflected
that
if
i
could
only
find
a
man
wiser
than
myself
then
i
might
go
to
the
god
with
a
refutation
in
my
hand
i
should
say
to
him
is
a
man
who
is
wiser
than
i
am
but
you
said
that
i
was
the
wisest
accordingly
i
went
to
one
who
had
the
reputation
of
wisdom
and
observed
him
his
name
i
need
not
mention
he
was
a
politician
whom
i
selected
for
examination
and
the
result
was
as
follows
when
i
began
to
talk
with
him
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
he
was
not
really
wise
although
he
was
thought
wise
by
many
and
still
wiser
by
himself
and
thereupon
i
tried
to
explain
to
him
that
he
thought
himself
wise
but
was
not
really
wise
and
the
consequence
was
that
he
hated
me
and
his
enmity
was
shared
by
several
who
were
present
and
heard
me
so
i
left
him
saying
to
myself
as
i
went
away
well
although
i
do
not
suppose
that
either
of
us
knows
anything
really
beautiful
and
good
i
am
better
off
than
he
is
for
he
knows
nothing
and
thinks
that
he
knows
i
neither
know
nor
think
that
i
know
in
this
latter
particular
then
i
seem
to
have
slightly
the
advantage
of
him
then
i
went
to
another
who
had
still
higher
pretensions
to
wisdom
and
my
conclusion
was
exactly
the
same
whereupon
i
made
another
enemy
of
him
and
of
many
others
besides
him
then
i
went
to
one
man
after
another
being
not
unconscious
of
the
enmity
which
i
provoked
and
i
lamented
and
feared
this
but
necessity
was
laid
upon
me
the
word
of
god
i
thought
ought
to
be
considered
first
and
i
said
to
myself
go
i
must
to
all
who
appear
to
know
and
find
out
the
meaning
of
the
oracle
and
i
swear
to
you
athenians
by
the
dog
i
swear
for
i
must
tell
you
the
truth
the
result
of
my
mission
was
just
this
i
found
that
the
men
most
in
repute
were
all
but
the
most
foolish
and
that
others
less
esteemed
were
really
wiser
and
better
i
will
tell
you
the
tale
of
my
wanderings
and
of
the
labours
as
i
may
call
them
which
i
endured
only
to
find
at
last
the
oracle
irrefutable
after
the
politicians
i
went
to
the
poets
tragic
dithyrambic
and
all
sorts
and
there
i
said
to
myself
you
will
be
instantly
detected
now
you
will
find
out
that
you
are
more
ignorant
than
they
are
accordingly
i
took
them
some
of
the
most
elaborate
passages
in
their
own
writings
and
asked
what
was
the
meaning
of
them
thinking
that
they
would
teach
me
something
will
you
believe
me
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
confess
the
truth
but
i
must
say
that
there
is
hardly
a
person
present
who
would
not
have
talked
better
about
their
poetry
than
they
did
themselves
then
i
knew
that
not
by
wisdom
do
poets
write
poetry
but
by
a
sort
of
genius
and
inspiration
they
are
like
diviners
or
soothsayers
who
also
say
many
fine
things
but
do
not
understand
the
meaning
of
them
the
poets
appeared
to
me
to
be
much
in
the
same
case
and
i
further
observed
that
upon
the
strength
of
their
poetry
they
believed
themselves
to
be
the
wisest
of
men
in
other
things
in
which
they
were
not
wise
so
i
departed
conceiving
myself
to
be
superior
to
them
for
the
same
reason
that
i
was
superior
to
the
politicians
at
last
i
went
to
the
artisans
i
was
conscious
that
i
knew
nothing
at
all
as
i
may
say
and
i
was
sure
that
they
knew
many
fine
things
and
here
i
was
not
mistaken
for
they
did
know
many
things
of
which
i
was
ignorant
and
in
this
they
certainly
were
wiser
than
i
was
but
i
observed
that
even
the
good
artisans
fell
into
the
same
error
as
the
poets
because
they
were
good
workmen
they
thought
that
they
also
knew
all
sorts
of
high
matters
and
this
defect
in
them
overshadowed
their
wisdom
and
therefore
i
asked
myself
on
behalf
of
the
oracle
whether
i
would
like
to
be
as
i
was
neither
having
their
knowledge
nor
their
ignorance
or
like
them
in
both
and
i
made
answer
to
myself
and
to
the
oracle
that
i
was
better
off
as
i
was
this
inquisition
has
led
to
my
having
many
enemies
of
the
worst
and
most
dangerous
kind
and
has
given
occasion
also
to
many
calumnies
and
i
am
called
wise
for
my
hearers
always
imagine
that
i
myself
possess
the
wisdom
which
i
find
wanting
in
others
but
the
truth
is
o
men
of
athens
that
god
only
is
wise
and
by
his
answer
he
intends
to
show
that
the
wisdom
of
men
is
worth
little
or
nothing
he
is
not
speaking
of
socrates
he
is
only
using
my
name
by
way
of
illustration
as
if
he
said
he
o
men
is
the
wisest
who
like
socrates
knows
that
his
wisdom
is
in
truth
worth
nothing
and
so
i
go
about
the
world
obedient
to
the
god
and
search
and
make
enquiry
into
the
wisdom
of
any
one
whether
citizen
or
stranger
who
appears
to
be
wise
and
if
he
is
not
wise
then
in
vindication
of
the
oracle
i
show
him
that
he
is
not
wise
and
my
occupation
quite
absorbs
me
and
i
have
no
time
to
give
either
to
any
public
matter
of
interest
or
to
any
concern
of
my
own
but
i
am
in
utter
poverty
by
reason
of
my
devotion
to
the
god
there
is
another
thing
young
men
of
the
richer
classes
who
have
not
much
to
do
come
about
me
of
their
own
accord
they
like
to
hear
the
pretenders
examined
and
they
often
imitate
me
and
proceed
to
examine
others
there
are
plenty
of
persons
as
they
quickly
discover
who
think
that
they
know
something
but
really
know
little
or
nothing
and
then
those
who
are
examined
by
them
instead
of
being
angry
with
themselves
are
angry
with
me
this
confounded
socrates
they
say
this
villainous
misleader
of
youth
and
then
if
somebody
asks
them
why
what
evil
does
he
practise
or
teach
they
do
not
know
and
can
not
tell
but
in
order
that
they
may
not
appear
to
be
at
a
loss
they
repeat
the
charges
which
are
used
against
all
philosophers
about
teaching
things
up
in
the
clouds
and
under
the
earth
and
having
no
gods
and
making
the
worse
appear
the
better
cause
for
they
do
not
like
to
confess
that
their
pretence
of
knowledge
has
been
detected
which
is
the
truth
and
as
they
are
numerous
and
ambitious
and
energetic
and
are
drawn
up
in
battle
array
and
have
persuasive
tongues
they
have
filled
your
ears
with
their
loud
and
inveterate
calumnies
and
this
is
the
reason
why
my
three
accusers
meletus
and
anytus
and
lycon
have
set
upon
me
meletus
who
has
a
quarrel
with
me
on
behalf
of
the
poets
anytus
on
behalf
of
the
craftsmen
and
politicians
lycon
on
behalf
of
the
rhetoricians
and
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
i
can
not
expect
to
get
rid
of
such
a
mass
of
calumny
all
in
a
moment
and
this
o
men
of
athens
is
the
truth
and
the
whole
truth
i
have
concealed
nothing
i
have
dissembled
nothing
and
yet
i
know
that
my
plainness
of
speech
makes
them
hate
me
and
what
is
their
hatred
but
a
proof
that
i
am
speaking
the
truth
hence
has
arisen
the
prejudice
against
me
and
this
is
the
reason
of
it
as
you
will
find
out
either
in
this
or
in
any
future
enquiry
i
have
said
enough
in
my
defence
against
the
first
class
of
my
accusers
i
turn
to
the
second
class
they
are
headed
by
meletus
that
good
man
and
true
lover
of
his
country
as
he
calls
himself
against
these
too
i
must
try
to
make
a
defence
let
their
affidavit
be
read
it
contains
something
of
this
kind
it
says
that
socrates
is
a
doer
of
evil
who
corrupts
the
youth
and
who
does
not
believe
in
the
gods
of
the
state
but
has
other
new
divinities
of
his
own
such
is
the
charge
and
now
let
us
examine
the
particular
counts
he
says
that
i
am
a
doer
of
evil
and
corrupt
the
youth
but
i
say
o
men
of
athens
that
meletus
is
a
doer
of
evil
in
that
he
pretends
to
be
in
earnest
when
he
is
only
in
jest
and
is
so
eager
to
bring
men
to
trial
from
a
pretended
zeal
and
interest
about
matters
in
which
he
really
never
had
the
smallest
interest
and
the
truth
of
this
i
will
endeavour
to
prove
to
you
come
hither
meletus
and
let
me
ask
a
question
of
you
you
think
a
great
deal
about
the
improvement
of
youth
yes
i
do
tell
the
judges
then
who
is
their
improver
for
you
must
know
as
you
have
taken
the
pains
to
discover
their
corrupter
and
are
citing
and
accusing
me
before
them
speak
then
and
tell
the
judges
who
their
improver
observe
meletus
that
you
are
silent
and
have
nothing
to
say
but
is
not
this
rather
disgraceful
and
a
very
considerable
proof
of
what
i
was
saying
that
you
have
no
interest
in
the
matter
speak
up
friend
and
tell
us
who
their
improver
is
the
laws
but
that
my
good
sir
is
not
my
meaning
i
want
to
know
who
the
person
is
who
in
the
first
place
knows
the
laws
the
judges
socrates
who
are
present
in
court
what
do
you
mean
to
say
meletus
that
they
are
able
to
instruct
and
improve
youth
certainly
they
are
what
all
of
them
or
some
only
and
not
others
all
of
them
by
the
goddess
here
that
is
good
news
there
are
plenty
of
improvers
then
and
what
do
you
say
of
the
audience
do
they
improve
them
yes
they
do
and
the
senators
yes
the
senators
improve
them
but
perhaps
the
members
of
the
assembly
corrupt
them
or
do
they
too
improve
them
they
improve
them
then
every
athenian
improves
and
elevates
them
all
with
the
exception
of
myself
and
i
alone
am
their
corrupter
is
that
what
you
affirm
that
is
what
i
stoutly
affirm
i
am
very
unfortunate
if
you
are
right
but
suppose
i
ask
you
a
question
how
about
horses
does
one
man
do
them
harm
and
all
the
world
good
is
not
the
exact
opposite
the
truth
one
man
is
able
to
do
them
good
or
at
least
not
many
the
trainer
of
horses
that
is
to
say
does
them
good
and
others
who
have
to
do
with
them
rather
injure
them
is
not
that
true
meletus
of
horses
or
of
any
other
animals
most
assuredly
it
is
whether
you
and
anytus
say
yes
or
no
happy
indeed
would
be
the
condition
of
youth
if
they
had
one
corrupter
only
and
all
the
rest
of
the
world
were
their
improvers
but
you
meletus
have
sufficiently
shown
that
you
never
had
a
thought
about
the
young
your
carelessness
is
seen
in
your
not
caring
about
the
very
things
which
you
bring
against
me
and
now
meletus
i
will
ask
you
another
question
by
zeus
i
will
which
is
better
to
live
among
bad
citizens
or
among
good
ones
answer
friend
i
say
the
question
is
one
which
may
be
easily
answered
do
not
the
good
do
their
neighbours
good
and
the
bad
do
them
evil
certainly
and
is
there
anyone
who
would
rather
be
injured
than
benefited
by
those
who
live
with
him
answer
my
good
friend
the
law
requires
you
to
answer
does
any
one
like
to
be
injured
certainly
not
and
when
you
accuse
me
of
corrupting
and
deteriorating
the
youth
do
you
allege
that
i
corrupt
them
intentionally
or
unintentionally
intentionally
i
say
but
you
have
just
admitted
that
the
good
do
their
neighbours
good
and
the
evil
do
them
evil
now
is
that
a
truth
which
your
superior
wisdom
has
recognized
thus
early
in
life
and
am
i
at
my
age
in
such
darkness
and
ignorance
as
not
to
know
that
if
a
man
with
whom
i
have
to
live
is
corrupted
by
me
i
am
very
likely
to
be
harmed
by
him
and
yet
i
corrupt
him
and
intentionally
too
so
you
say
although
neither
i
nor
any
other
human
being
is
ever
likely
to
be
convinced
by
you
but
either
i
do
not
corrupt
them
or
i
corrupt
them
unintentionally
and
on
either
view
of
the
case
you
lie
if
my
offence
is
unintentional
the
law
has
no
cognizance
of
unintentional
offences
you
ought
to
have
taken
me
privately
and
warned
and
admonished
me
for
if
i
had
been
better
advised
i
should
have
left
off
doing
what
i
only
did
unintentionally
no
doubt
i
should
but
you
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
me
and
refused
to
teach
me
and
now
you
bring
me
up
in
this
court
which
is
a
place
not
of
instruction
but
of
punishment
it
will
be
very
clear
to
you
athenians
as
i
was
saying
that
meletus
has
no
care
at
all
great
or
small
about
the
matter
but
still
i
should
like
to
know
meletus
in
what
i
am
affirmed
to
corrupt
the
young
i
suppose
you
mean
as
i
infer
from
your
indictment
that
i
teach
them
not
to
acknowledge
the
gods
which
the
state
acknowledges
but
some
other
new
divinities
or
spiritual
agencies
in
their
stead
these
are
the
lessons
by
which
i
corrupt
the
youth
as
you
say
yes
that
i
say
emphatically
then
by
the
gods
meletus
of
whom
we
are
speaking
tell
me
and
the
court
in
somewhat
plainer
terms
what
you
mean
for
i
do
not
as
yet
understand
whether
you
affirm
that
i
teach
other
men
to
acknowledge
some
gods
and
therefore
that
i
do
believe
in
gods
and
am
not
an
entire
atheist
this
you
do
not
lay
to
my
charge
but
only
you
say
that
they
are
not
the
same
gods
which
the
city
recognizes
the
charge
is
that
they
are
different
gods
or
do
you
mean
that
i
am
an
atheist
simply
and
a
teacher
of
atheism
i
mean
the
latter
that
you
are
a
complete
atheist
what
an
extraordinary
statement
why
do
you
think
so
meletus
do
you
mean
that
i
do
not
believe
in
the
godhead
of
the
sun
or
moon
like
other
men
i
assure
you
judges
that
he
does
not
for
he
says
that
the
sun
is
stone
and
the
moon
earth
friend
meletus
you
think
that
you
are
accusing
anaxagoras
and
you
have
but
a
bad
opinion
of
the
judges
if
you
fancy
them
illiterate
to
such
a
degree
as
not
to
know
that
these
doctrines
are
found
in
the
books
of
anaxagoras
the
clazomenian
which
are
full
of
them
and
so
forsooth
the
youth
are
said
to
be
taught
them
by
socrates
when
there
are
not
unfrequently
exhibitions
of
them
at
the
theatre
probably
in
allusion
to
aristophanes
who
caricatured
and
to
euripides
who
borrowed
the
notions
of
anaxagoras
as
well
as
to
other
dramatic
poets
price
of
admission
one
drachma
at
the
most
and
they
might
pay
their
money
and
laugh
at
socrates
if
he
pretends
to
father
these
extraordinary
views
and
so
meletus
you
really
think
that
i
do
not
believe
in
any
god
i
swear
by
zeus
that
you
believe
absolutely
in
none
at
all
nobody
will
believe
you
meletus
and
i
am
pretty
sure
that
you
do
not
believe
yourself
i
can
not
help
thinking
men
of
athens
that
meletus
is
reckless
and
impudent
and
that
he
has
written
this
indictment
in
a
spirit
of
mere
wantonness
and
youthful
bravado
has
he
not
compounded
a
riddle
thinking
to
try
me
he
said
to
himself
i
shall
see
whether
the
wise
socrates
will
discover
my
facetious
contradiction
or
whether
i
shall
be
able
to
deceive
him
and
the
rest
of
them
for
he
certainly
does
appear
to
me
to
contradict
himself
in
the
indictment
as
much
as
if
he
said
that
socrates
is
guilty
of
not
believing
in
the
gods
and
yet
of
believing
in
them
but
this
is
not
like
a
person
who
is
in
earnest
i
should
like
you
o
men
of
athens
to
join
me
in
examining
what
i
conceive
to
be
his
inconsistency
and
do
you
meletus
answer
and
i
must
remind
the
audience
of
my
request
that
they
would
not
make
a
disturbance
if
i
speak
in
my
accustomed
manner
did
ever
man
meletus
believe
in
the
existence
of
human
things
and
not
of
human
beings
i
wish
men
of
athens
that
he
would
answer
and
not
be
always
trying
to
get
up
an
interruption
did
ever
any
man
believe
in
horsemanship
and
not
in
horses
or
in
and
not
in
no
my
friend
i
will
answer
to
you
and
to
the
court
as
you
refuse
to
answer
for
yourself
there
is
no
man
who
ever
did
but
now
please
to
answer
the
next
question
can
a
man
believe
in
spiritual
and
divine
agencies
and
not
in
spirits
or
demigods
he
can
not
how
lucky
i
am
to
have
extracted
that
answer
by
the
assistance
of
the
court
but
then
you
swear
in
the
indictment
that
i
teach
and
believe
in
divine
or
spiritual
agencies
new
or
old
no
matter
for
that
at
any
rate
i
believe
in
spiritual
agencies
so
you
say
and
swear
in
the
affidavit
and
yet
if
i
believe
in
divine
beings
how
can
i
help
believing
in
spirits
or
demigods
must
i
not
to
be
sure
i
must
and
therefore
i
may
assume
that
your
silence
gives
consent
now
what
are
spirits
or
demigods
are
they
not
either
gods
or
the
sons
of
gods
certainly
they
are
but
this
is
what
i
call
the
facetious
riddle
invented
by
you
the
demigods
or
spirits
are
gods
and
you
say
first
that
i
do
not
believe
in
gods
and
then
again
that
i
do
believe
in
gods
that
is
if
i
believe
in
demigods
for
if
the
demigods
are
the
illegitimate
sons
of
gods
whether
by
the
nymphs
or
by
any
other
mothers
of
whom
they
are
said
to
be
the
sons
what
human
being
will
ever
believe
that
there
are
no
gods
if
they
are
the
sons
of
gods
you
might
as
well
affirm
the
existence
of
mules
and
deny
that
of
horses
and
asses
such
nonsense
meletus
could
only
have
been
intended
by
you
to
make
trial
of
me
you
have
put
this
into
the
indictment
because
you
had
nothing
real
of
which
to
accuse
me
but
no
one
who
has
a
particle
of
understanding
will
ever
be
convinced
by
you
that
the
same
men
can
believe
in
divine
and
superhuman
things
and
yet
not
believe
that
there
are
gods
and
demigods
and
heroes
i
have
said
enough
in
answer
to
the
charge
of
meletus
any
elaborate
defence
is
unnecessary
but
i
know
only
too
well
how
many
are
the
enmities
which
i
have
incurred
and
this
is
what
will
be
my
destruction
if
i
am
destroyed
not
meletus
nor
yet
anytus
but
the
envy
and
detraction
of
the
world
which
has
been
the
death
of
many
good
men
and
will
probably
be
the
death
of
many
more
there
is
no
danger
of
my
being
the
last
of
them
some
one
will
say
and
are
you
not
ashamed
socrates
of
a
course
of
life
which
is
likely
to
bring
you
to
an
untimely
end
to
him
i
may
fairly
answer
there
you
are
mistaken
a
man
who
is
good
for
anything
ought
not
to
calculate
the
chance
of
living
or
dying
he
ought
only
to
consider
whether
in
doing
anything
he
is
doing
right
or
wrong
acting
the
part
of
a
good
man
or
of
a
bad
whereas
upon
your
view
the
heroes
who
fell
at
troy
were
not
good
for
much
and
the
son
of
thetis
above
all
who
altogether
despised
danger
in
comparison
with
disgrace
and
when
he
was
so
eager
to
slay
hector
his
goddess
mother
said
to
him
that
if
he
avenged
his
companion
patroclus
and
slew
hector
he
would
die
himself
she
said
in
these
or
the
like
words
for
you
next
after
hector
he
receiving
this
warning
utterly
despised
danger
and
death
and
instead
of
fearing
them
feared
rather
to
live
in
dishonour
and
not
to
avenge
his
friend
me
die
forthwith
he
replies
be
avenged
of
my
enemy
rather
than
abide
here
by
the
beaked
ships
a
and
a
burden
of
the
earth
had
achilles
any
thought
of
death
and
danger
for
wherever
a
man
place
is
whether
the
place
which
he
has
chosen
or
that
in
which
he
has
been
placed
by
a
commander
there
he
ought
to
remain
in
the
hour
of
danger
he
should
not
think
of
death
or
of
anything
but
of
disgrace
and
this
o
men
of
athens
is
a
true
saying
strange
indeed
would
be
my
conduct
o
men
of
athens
if
i
who
when
i
was
ordered
by
the
generals
whom
you
chose
to
command
me
at
potidaea
and
amphipolis
and
delium
remained
where
they
placed
me
like
any
other
man
facing
death
if
now
when
as
i
conceive
and
imagine
god
orders
me
to
fulfil
the
philosopher
mission
of
searching
into
myself
and
other
men
i
were
to
desert
my
post
through
fear
of
death
or
any
other
fear
that
would
indeed
be
strange
and
i
might
justly
be
arraigned
in
court
for
denying
the
existence
of
the
gods
if
i
disobeyed
the
oracle
because
i
was
afraid
of
death
fancying
that
i
was
wise
when
i
was
not
wise
for
the
fear
of
death
is
indeed
the
pretence
of
wisdom
and
not
real
wisdom
being
a
pretence
of
knowing
the
unknown
and
no
one
knows
whether
death
which
men
in
their
fear
apprehend
to
be
the
greatest
evil
may
not
be
the
greatest
good
is
not
this
ignorance
of
a
disgraceful
sort
the
ignorance
which
is
the
conceit
that
a
man
knows
what
he
does
not
know
and
in
this
respect
only
i
believe
myself
to
differ
from
men
in
general
and
may
perhaps
claim
to
be
wiser
than
they
are
that
whereas
i
know
but
little
of
the
world
below
i
do
not
suppose
that
i
know
but
i
do
know
that
injustice
and
disobedience
to
a
better
whether
god
or
man
is
evil
and
dishonourable
and
i
will
never
fear
or
avoid
a
possible
good
rather
than
a
certain
evil
and
therefore
if
you
let
me
go
now
and
are
not
convinced
by
anytus
who
said
that
since
i
had
been
prosecuted
i
must
be
put
to
death
or
if
not
that
i
ought
never
to
have
been
prosecuted
at
all
and
that
if
i
escape
now
your
sons
will
all
be
utterly
ruined
by
listening
to
my
words
if
you
say
to
me
socrates
this
time
we
will
not
mind
anytus
and
you
shall
be
let
off
but
upon
one
condition
that
you
are
not
to
enquire
and
speculate
in
this
way
any
more
and
that
if
you
are
caught
doing
so
again
you
shall
die
if
this
was
the
condition
on
which
you
let
me
go
i
should
reply
men
of
athens
i
honour
and
love
you
but
i
shall
obey
god
rather
than
you
and
while
i
have
life
and
strength
i
shall
never
cease
from
the
practice
and
teaching
of
philosophy
exhorting
any
one
whom
i
meet
and
saying
to
him
after
my
manner
you
my
friend
a
citizen
of
the
great
and
mighty
and
wise
city
of
athens
are
you
not
ashamed
of
heaping
up
the
greatest
amount
of
money
and
honour
and
reputation
and
caring
so
little
about
wisdom
and
truth
and
the
greatest
improvement
of
the
soul
which
you
never
regard
or
heed
at
all
and
if
the
person
with
whom
i
am
arguing
says
yes
but
i
do
care
then
i
do
not
leave
him
or
let
him
go
at
once
but
i
proceed
to
interrogate
and
examine
and
him
and
if
i
think
that
he
has
no
virtue
in
him
but
only
says
that
he
has
i
reproach
him
with
undervaluing
the
greater
and
overvaluing
the
less
and
i
shall
repeat
the
same
words
to
every
one
whom
i
meet
young
and
old
citizen
and
alien
but
especially
to
the
citizens
inasmuch
as
they
are
my
brethren
for
know
that
this
is
the
command
of
god
and
i
believe
that
no
greater
good
has
ever
happened
in
the
state
than
my
service
to
the
god
for
i
do
nothing
but
go
about
persuading
you
all
old
and
young
alike
not
to
take
thought
for
your
persons
or
your
properties
but
first
and
chiefly
to
care
about
the
greatest
improvement
of
the
soul
i
tell
you
that
virtue
is
not
given
by
money
but
that
from
virtue
comes
money
and
every
other
good
of
man
public
as
well
as
private
this
is
my
teaching
and
if
this
is
the
doctrine
which
corrupts
the
youth
i
am
a
mischievous
person
but
if
any
one
says
that
this
is
not
my
teaching
he
is
speaking
an
untruth
wherefore
o
men
of
athens
i
say
to
you
do
as
anytus
bids
or
not
as
anytus
bids
and
either
acquit
me
or
not
but
whichever
you
do
understand
that
i
shall
never
alter
my
ways
not
even
if
i
have
to
die
many
times
men
of
athens
do
not
interrupt
but
hear
me
there
was
an
understanding
between
us
that
you
should
hear
me
to
the
end
i
have
something
more
to
say
at
which
you
may
be
inclined
to
cry
out
but
i
believe
that
to
hear
me
will
be
good
for
you
and
therefore
i
beg
that
you
will
not
cry
out
i
would
have
you
know
that
if
you
kill
such
an
one
as
i
am
you
will
injure
yourselves
more
than
you
will
injure
me
nothing
will
injure
me
not
meletus
nor
yet
anytus
they
can
not
for
a
bad
man
is
not
permitted
to
injure
a
better
than
himself
i
do
not
deny
that
anytus
may
perhaps
kill
him
or
drive
him
into
exile
or
deprive
him
of
civil
rights
and
he
may
imagine
and
others
may
imagine
that
he
is
inflicting
a
great
injury
upon
him
but
there
i
do
not
agree
for
the
evil
of
doing
as
he
is
doing
the
evil
of
unjustly
taking
away
the
life
of
another
is
greater
far
and
now
athenians
i
am
not
going
to
argue
for
my
own
sake
as
you
may
think
but
for
yours
that
you
may
not
sin
against
the
god
by
condemning
me
who
am
his
gift
to
you
for
if
you
kill
me
you
will
not
easily
find
a
successor
to
me
who
if
i
may
use
such
a
ludicrous
figure
of
speech
am
a
sort
of
gadfly
given
to
the
state
by
god
and
the
state
is
a
great
and
noble
steed
who
is
tardy
in
his
motions
owing
to
his
very
size
and
requires
to
be
stirred
into
life
i
am
that
gadfly
which
god
has
attached
to
the
state
and
all
day
long
and
in
all
places
am
always
fastening
upon
you
arousing
and
persuading
and
reproaching
you
you
will
not
easily
find
another
like
me
and
therefore
i
would
advise
you
to
spare
me
i
dare
say
that
you
may
feel
out
of
temper
like
a
person
who
is
suddenly
awakened
from
sleep
and
you
think
that
you
might
easily
strike
me
dead
as
anytus
advises
and
then
you
would
sleep
on
for
the
remainder
of
your
lives
unless
god
in
his
care
of
you
sent
you
another
gadfly
when
i
say
that
i
am
given
to
you
by
god
the
proof
of
my
mission
is
this
if
i
had
been
like
other
men
i
should
not
have
neglected
all
my
own
concerns
or
patiently
seen
the
neglect
of
them
during
all
these
years
and
have
been
doing
yours
coming
to
you
individually
like
a
father
or
elder
brother
exhorting
you
to
regard
virtue
such
conduct
i
say
would
be
unlike
human
nature
if
i
had
gained
anything
or
if
my
exhortations
had
been
paid
there
would
have
been
some
sense
in
my
doing
so
but
now
as
you
will
perceive
not
even
the
impudence
of
my
accusers
dares
to
say
that
i
have
ever
exacted
or
sought
pay
of
any
one
of
that
they
have
no
witness
and
i
have
a
sufficient
witness
to
the
truth
of
what
i
say
my
poverty
some
one
may
wonder
why
i
go
about
in
private
giving
advice
and
busying
myself
with
the
concerns
of
others
but
do
not
venture
to
come
forward
in
public
and
advise
the
state
i
will
tell
you
why
you
have
heard
me
speak
at
sundry
times
and
in
divers
places
of
an
oracle
or
sign
which
comes
to
me
and
is
the
divinity
which
meletus
ridicules
in
the
indictment
this
sign
which
is
a
kind
of
voice
first
began
to
come
to
me
when
i
was
a
child
it
always
forbids
but
never
commands
me
to
do
anything
which
i
am
going
to
do
this
is
what
deters
me
from
being
a
politician
and
rightly
as
i
think
for
i
am
certain
o
men
of
athens
that
if
i
had
engaged
in
politics
i
should
have
perished
long
ago
and
done
no
good
either
to
you
or
to
myself
and
do
not
be
offended
at
my
telling
you
the
truth
for
the
truth
is
that
no
man
who
goes
to
war
with
you
or
any
other
multitude
honestly
striving
against
the
many
lawless
and
unrighteous
deeds
which
are
done
in
a
state
will
save
his
life
he
who
will
fight
for
the
right
if
he
would
live
even
for
a
brief
space
must
have
a
private
station
and
not
a
public
one
i
can
give
you
convincing
evidence
of
what
i
say
not
words
only
but
what
you
value
far
more
actions
let
me
relate
to
you
a
passage
of
my
own
life
which
will
prove
to
you
that
i
should
never
have
yielded
to
injustice
from
any
fear
of
death
and
that
i
should
have
refused
to
yield
i
must
have
died
at
once
i
will
tell
you
a
tale
of
the
courts
not
very
interesting
perhaps
but
nevertheless
true
the
only
office
of
state
which
i
ever
held
o
men
of
athens
was
that
of
senator
the
tribe
antiochis
which
is
my
tribe
had
the
presidency
at
the
trial
of
the
generals
who
had
not
taken
up
the
bodies
of
the
slain
after
the
battle
of
arginusae
and
you
proposed
to
try
them
in
a
body
contrary
to
law
as
you
all
thought
afterwards
but
at
the
time
i
was
the
only
one
of
the
prytanes
who
was
opposed
to
the
illegality
and
i
gave
my
vote
against
you
and
when
the
orators
threatened
to
impeach
and
arrest
me
and
you
called
and
shouted
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
run
the
risk
having
law
and
justice
with
me
rather
than
take
part
in
your
injustice
because
i
feared
imprisonment
and
death
this
happened
in
the
days
of
the
democracy
but
when
the
oligarchy
of
the
thirty
was
in
power
they
sent
for
me
and
four
others
into
the
rotunda
and
bade
us
bring
leon
the
salaminian
from
salamis
as
they
wanted
to
put
him
to
death
this
was
a
specimen
of
the
sort
of
commands
which
they
were
always
giving
with
the
view
of
implicating
as
many
as
possible
in
their
crimes
and
then
i
showed
not
in
word
only
but
in
deed
that
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
use
such
an
expression
i
cared
not
a
straw
for
death
and
that
my
great
and
only
care
was
lest
i
should
do
an
unrighteous
or
unholy
thing
for
the
strong
arm
of
that
oppressive
power
did
not
frighten
me
into
doing
wrong
and
when
we
came
out
of
the
rotunda
the
other
four
went
to
salamis
and
fetched
leon
but
i
went
quietly
home
for
which
i
might
have
lost
my
life
had
not
the
power
of
the
thirty
shortly
afterwards
come
to
an
end
and
many
will
witness
to
my
words
now
do
you
really
imagine
that
i
could
have
survived
all
these
years
if
i
had
led
a
public
life
supposing
that
like
a
good
man
i
had
always
maintained
the
right
and
had
made
justice
as
i
ought
the
first
thing
no
indeed
men
of
athens
neither
i
nor
any
other
man
but
i
have
been
always
the
same
in
all
my
actions
public
as
well
as
private
and
never
have
i
yielded
any
base
compliance
to
those
who
are
slanderously
termed
my
disciples
or
to
any
other
not
that
i
have
any
regular
disciples
but
if
any
one
likes
to
come
and
hear
me
while
i
am
pursuing
my
mission
whether
he
be
young
or
old
he
is
not
excluded
nor
do
i
converse
only
with
those
who
pay
but
any
one
whether
he
be
rich
or
poor
may
ask
and
answer
me
and
listen
to
my
words
and
whether
he
turns
out
to
be
a
bad
man
or
a
good
one
neither
result
can
be
justly
imputed
to
me
for
i
never
taught
or
professed
to
teach
him
anything
and
if
any
one
says
that
he
has
ever
learned
or
heard
anything
from
me
in
private
which
all
the
world
has
not
heard
let
me
tell
you
that
he
is
lying
but
i
shall
be
asked
why
do
people
delight
in
continually
conversing
with
you
i
have
told
you
already
athenians
the
whole
truth
about
this
matter
they
like
to
hear
the
of
the
pretenders
to
wisdom
there
is
amusement
in
it
now
this
duty
of
other
men
has
been
imposed
upon
me
by
god
and
has
been
signified
to
me
by
oracles
visions
and
in
every
way
in
which
the
will
of
divine
power
was
ever
intimated
to
any
one
this
is
true
o
athenians
or
if
not
true
would
be
soon
refuted
if
i
am
or
have
been
corrupting
the
youth
those
of
them
who
are
now
grown
up
and
have
become
sensible
that
i
gave
them
bad
advice
in
the
days
of
their
youth
should
come
forward
as
accusers
and
take
their
revenge
or
if
they
do
not
like
to
come
themselves
some
of
their
relatives
fathers
brothers
or
other
kinsmen
should
say
what
evil
their
families
have
suffered
at
my
hands
now
is
their
time
many
of
them
i
see
in
the
court
there
is
crito
who
is
of
the
same
age
and
of
the
same
deme
with
myself
and
there
is
critobulus
his
son
whom
i
also
see
then
again
there
is
lysanias
of
sphettus
who
is
the
father
of
aeschines
he
is
present
and
also
there
is
antiphon
of
cephisus
who
is
the
father
of
epigenes
and
there
are
the
brothers
of
several
who
have
associated
with
me
there
is
nicostratus
the
son
of
theosdotides
and
the
brother
of
theodotus
now
theodotus
himself
is
dead
and
therefore
he
at
any
rate
will
not
seek
to
stop
him
and
there
is
paralus
the
son
of
demodocus
who
had
a
brother
theages
and
adeimantus
the
son
of
ariston
whose
brother
plato
is
present
and
aeantodorus
who
is
the
brother
of
apollodorus
whom
i
also
see
i
might
mention
a
great
many
others
some
of
whom
meletus
should
have
produced
as
witnesses
in
the
course
of
his
speech
and
let
him
still
produce
them
if
he
has
forgotten
i
will
make
way
for
him
and
let
him
say
if
he
has
any
testimony
of
the
sort
which
he
can
produce
nay
athenians
the
very
opposite
is
the
truth
for
all
these
are
ready
to
witness
on
behalf
of
the
corrupter
of
the
injurer
of
their
kindred
as
meletus
and
anytus
call
me
not
the
corrupted
youth
only
there
might
have
been
a
motive
for
that
but
their
uncorrupted
elder
relatives
why
should
they
too
support
me
with
their
testimony
why
indeed
except
for
the
sake
of
truth
and
justice
and
because
they
know
that
i
am
speaking
the
truth
and
that
meletus
is
a
liar
well
athenians
this
and
the
like
of
this
is
all
the
defence
which
i
have
to
offer
yet
a
word
more
perhaps
there
may
be
some
one
who
is
offended
at
me
when
he
calls
to
mind
how
he
himself
on
a
similar
or
even
a
less
serious
occasion
prayed
and
entreated
the
judges
with
many
tears
and
how
he
produced
his
children
in
court
which
was
a
moving
spectacle
together
with
a
host
of
relations
and
friends
whereas
i
who
am
probably
in
danger
of
my
life
will
do
none
of
these
things
the
contrast
may
occur
to
his
mind
and
he
may
be
set
against
me
and
vote
in
anger
because
he
is
displeased
at
me
on
this
account
now
if
there
be
such
a
person
among
you
mind
i
do
not
say
that
there
is
to
him
i
may
fairly
reply
my
friend
i
am
a
man
and
like
other
men
a
creature
of
flesh
and
blood
and
not
wood
or
stone
as
homer
says
and
i
have
a
family
yes
and
sons
o
athenians
three
in
number
one
almost
a
man
and
two
others
who
are
still
young
and
yet
i
will
not
bring
any
of
them
hither
in
order
to
petition
you
for
an
acquittal
and
why
not
not
from
any
or
want
of
respect
for
you
whether
i
am
or
am
not
afraid
of
death
is
another
question
of
which
i
will
not
now
speak
but
having
regard
to
public
opinion
i
feel
that
such
conduct
would
be
discreditable
to
myself
and
to
you
and
to
the
whole
state
one
who
has
reached
my
years
and
who
has
a
name
for
wisdom
ought
not
to
demean
himself
whether
this
opinion
of
me
be
deserved
or
not
at
any
rate
the
world
has
decided
that
socrates
is
in
some
way
superior
to
other
men
and
if
those
among
you
who
are
said
to
be
superior
in
wisdom
and
courage
and
any
other
virtue
demean
themselves
in
this
way
how
shameful
is
their
conduct
i
have
seen
men
of
reputation
when
they
have
been
condemned
behaving
in
the
strangest
manner
they
seemed
to
fancy
that
they
were
going
to
suffer
something
dreadful
if
they
died
and
that
they
could
be
immortal
if
you
only
allowed
them
to
live
and
i
think
that
such
are
a
dishonour
to
the
state
and
that
any
stranger
coming
in
would
have
said
of
them
that
the
most
eminent
men
of
athens
to
whom
the
athenians
themselves
give
honour
and
command
are
no
better
than
women
and
i
say
that
these
things
ought
not
to
be
done
by
those
of
us
who
have
a
reputation
and
if
they
are
done
you
ought
not
to
permit
them
you
ought
rather
to
show
that
you
are
far
more
disposed
to
condemn
the
man
who
gets
up
a
doleful
scene
and
makes
the
city
ridiculous
than
him
who
holds
his
peace
but
setting
aside
the
question
of
public
opinion
there
seems
to
be
something
wrong
in
asking
a
favour
of
a
judge
and
thus
procuring
an
acquittal
instead
of
informing
and
convincing
him
for
his
duty
is
not
to
make
a
present
of
justice
but
to
give
judgment
and
he
has
sworn
that
he
will
judge
according
to
the
laws
and
not
according
to
his
own
good
pleasure
and
we
ought
not
to
encourage
you
nor
should
you
allow
yourselves
to
be
encouraged
in
this
habit
of
perjury
there
can
be
no
piety
in
that
do
not
then
require
me
to
do
what
i
consider
dishonourable
and
impious
and
wrong
especially
now
when
i
am
being
tried
for
impiety
on
the
indictment
of
meletus
for
if
o
men
of
athens
by
force
of
persuasion
and
entreaty
i
could
overpower
your
oaths
then
i
should
be
teaching
you
to
believe
that
there
are
no
gods
and
in
defending
should
simply
convict
myself
of
the
charge
of
not
believing
in
them
but
that
is
not
so
far
otherwise
for
i
do
believe
that
there
are
gods
and
in
a
sense
higher
than
that
in
which
any
of
my
accusers
believe
in
them
and
to
you
and
to
god
i
commit
my
cause
to
be
determined
by
you
as
is
best
for
you
and
me
there
are
many
reasons
why
i
am
not
grieved
o
men
of
athens
at
the
vote
of
condemnation
i
expected
it
and
am
only
surprised
that
the
votes
are
so
nearly
equal
for
i
had
thought
that
the
majority
against
me
would
have
been
far
larger
but
now
had
thirty
votes
gone
over
to
the
other
side
i
should
have
been
acquitted
and
i
may
say
i
think
that
i
have
escaped
meletus
i
may
say
more
for
without
the
assistance
of
anytus
and
lycon
any
one
may
see
that
he
would
not
have
had
a
fifth
part
of
the
votes
as
the
law
requires
in
which
case
he
would
have
incurred
a
fine
of
a
thousand
drachmae
and
so
he
proposes
death
as
the
penalty
and
what
shall
i
propose
on
my
part
o
men
of
athens
clearly
that
which
is
my
due
and
what
is
my
due
what
return
shall
be
made
to
the
man
who
has
never
had
the
wit
to
be
idle
during
his
whole
life
but
has
been
careless
of
what
the
many
care
for
wealth
and
family
interests
and
military
offices
and
speaking
in
the
assembly
and
magistracies
and
plots
and
parties
reflecting
that
i
was
really
too
honest
a
man
to
be
a
politician
and
live
i
did
not
go
where
i
could
do
no
good
to
you
or
to
myself
but
where
i
could
do
the
greatest
good
privately
to
every
one
of
you
thither
i
went
and
sought
to
persuade
every
man
among
you
that
he
must
look
to
himself
and
seek
virtue
and
wisdom
before
he
looks
to
his
private
interests
and
look
to
the
state
before
he
looks
to
the
interests
of
the
state
and
that
this
should
be
the
order
which
he
observes
in
all
his
actions
what
shall
be
done
to
such
an
one
doubtless
some
good
thing
o
men
of
athens
if
he
has
his
reward
and
the
good
should
be
of
a
kind
suitable
to
him
what
would
be
a
reward
suitable
to
a
poor
man
who
is
your
benefactor
and
who
desires
leisure
that
he
may
instruct
you
there
can
be
no
reward
so
fitting
as
maintenance
in
the
prytaneum
o
men
of
athens
a
reward
which
he
deserves
far
more
than
the
citizen
who
has
won
the
prize
at
olympia
in
the
horse
or
chariot
race
whether
the
chariots
were
drawn
by
two
horses
or
by
many
for
i
am
in
want
and
he
has
enough
and
he
only
gives
you
the
appearance
of
happiness
and
i
give
you
the
reality
and
if
i
am
to
estimate
the
penalty
fairly
i
should
say
that
maintenance
in
the
prytaneum
is
the
just
return
perhaps
you
think
that
i
am
braving
you
in
what
i
am
saying
now
as
in
what
i
said
before
about
the
tears
and
prayers
but
this
is
not
so
i
speak
rather
because
i
am
convinced
that
i
never
intentionally
wronged
any
one
although
i
can
not
convince
you
the
time
has
been
too
short
if
there
were
a
law
at
athens
as
there
is
in
other
cities
that
a
capital
cause
should
not
be
decided
in
one
day
then
i
believe
that
i
should
have
convinced
you
but
i
can
not
in
a
moment
refute
great
slanders
and
as
i
am
convinced
that
i
never
wronged
another
i
will
assuredly
not
wrong
myself
i
will
not
say
of
myself
that
i
deserve
any
evil
or
propose
any
penalty
why
should
i
because
i
am
afraid
of
the
penalty
of
death
which
meletus
proposes
when
i
do
not
know
whether
death
is
a
good
or
an
evil
why
should
i
propose
a
penalty
which
would
certainly
be
an
evil
shall
i
say
imprisonment
and
why
should
i
live
in
prison
and
be
the
slave
of
the
magistrates
of
the
year
of
the
eleven
or
shall
the
penalty
be
a
fine
and
imprisonment
until
the
fine
is
paid
there
is
the
same
objection
i
should
have
to
lie
in
prison
for
money
i
have
none
and
can
not
pay
and
if
i
say
exile
and
this
may
possibly
be
the
penalty
which
you
will
affix
i
must
indeed
be
blinded
by
the
love
of
life
if
i
am
so
irrational
as
to
expect
that
when
you
who
are
my
own
citizens
can
not
endure
my
discourses
and
words
and
have
found
them
so
grievous
and
odious
that
you
will
have
no
more
of
them
others
are
likely
to
endure
me
no
indeed
men
of
athens
that
is
not
very
likely
and
what
a
life
should
i
lead
at
my
age
wandering
from
city
to
city
ever
changing
my
place
of
exile
and
always
being
driven
out
for
i
am
quite
sure
that
wherever
i
go
there
as
here
the
young
men
will
flock
to
me
and
if
i
drive
them
away
their
elders
will
drive
me
out
at
their
request
and
if
i
let
them
come
their
fathers
and
friends
will
drive
me
out
for
their
sakes
some
one
will
say
yes
socrates
but
can
not
you
hold
your
tongue
and
then
you
may
go
into
a
foreign
city
and
no
one
will
interfere
with
you
now
i
have
great
difficulty
in
making
you
understand
my
answer
to
this
for
if
i
tell
you
that
to
do
as
you
say
would
be
a
disobedience
to
the
god
and
therefore
that
i
can
not
hold
my
tongue
you
will
not
believe
that
i
am
serious
and
if
i
say
again
that
daily
to
discourse
about
virtue
and
of
those
other
things
about
which
you
hear
me
examining
myself
and
others
is
the
greatest
good
of
man
and
that
the
unexamined
life
is
not
worth
living
you
are
still
less
likely
to
believe
me
yet
i
say
what
is
true
although
a
thing
of
which
it
is
hard
for
me
to
persuade
you
also
i
have
never
been
accustomed
to
think
that
i
deserve
to
suffer
any
harm
had
i
money
i
might
have
estimated
the
offence
at
what
i
was
able
to
pay
and
not
have
been
much
the
worse
but
i
have
none
and
therefore
i
must
ask
you
to
proportion
the
fine
to
my
means
well
perhaps
i
could
afford
a
mina
and
therefore
i
propose
that
penalty
plato
crito
critobulus
and
apollodorus
my
friends
here
bid
me
say
thirty
minae
and
they
will
be
the
sureties
let
thirty
minae
be
the
penalty
for
which
sum
they
will
be
ample
security
to
you
not
much
time
will
be
gained
o
athenians
in
return
for
the
evil
name
which
you
will
get
from
the
detractors
of
the
city
who
will
say
that
you
killed
socrates
a
wise
man
for
they
will
call
me
wise
even
although
i
am
not
wise
when
they
want
to
reproach
you
if
you
had
waited
a
little
while
your
desire
would
have
been
fulfilled
in
the
course
of
nature
for
i
am
far
advanced
in
years
as
you
may
perceive
and
not
far
from
death
i
am
speaking
now
not
to
all
of
you
but
only
to
those
who
have
condemned
me
to
death
and
i
have
another
thing
to
say
to
them
you
think
that
i
was
convicted
because
i
had
no
words
of
the
sort
which
would
have
procured
my
acquittal
i
mean
if
i
had
thought
fit
to
leave
nothing
undone
or
unsaid
not
so
the
deficiency
which
led
to
my
conviction
was
not
of
words
certainly
not
but
i
had
not
the
boldness
or
impudence
or
inclination
to
address
you
as
you
would
have
liked
me
to
do
weeping
and
wailing
and
lamenting
and
saying
and
doing
many
things
which
you
have
been
accustomed
to
hear
from
others
and
which
as
i
maintain
are
unworthy
of
me
i
thought
at
the
time
that
i
ought
not
to
do
anything
common
or
mean
when
in
danger
nor
do
i
now
repent
of
the
style
of
my
defence
i
would
rather
die
having
spoken
after
my
manner
than
speak
in
your
manner
and
live
for
neither
in
war
nor
yet
at
law
ought
i
or
any
man
to
use
every
way
of
escaping
death
often
in
battle
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
if
a
man
will
throw
away
his
arms
and
fall
on
his
knees
before
his
pursuers
he
may
escape
death
and
in
other
dangers
there
are
other
ways
of
escaping
death
if
a
man
is
willing
to
say
and
do
anything
the
difficulty
my
friends
is
not
to
avoid
death
but
to
avoid
unrighteousness
for
that
runs
faster
than
death
i
am
old
and
move
slowly
and
the
slower
runner
has
overtaken
me
and
my
accusers
are
keen
and
quick
and
the
faster
runner
who
is
unrighteousness
has
overtaken
them
and
now
i
depart
hence
condemned
by
you
to
suffer
the
penalty
of
death
they
too
go
their
ways
condemned
by
the
truth
to
suffer
the
penalty
of
villainy
and
wrong
and
i
must
abide
by
my
award
let
them
abide
by
theirs
i
suppose
that
these
things
may
be
regarded
as
fated
and
i
think
that
they
are
well
and
now
o
men
who
have
condemned
me
i
would
fain
prophesy
to
you
for
i
am
about
to
die
and
in
the
hour
of
death
men
are
gifted
with
prophetic
power
and
i
prophesy
to
you
who
are
my
murderers
that
immediately
after
my
departure
punishment
far
heavier
than
you
have
inflicted
on
me
will
surely
await
you
me
you
have
killed
because
you
wanted
to
escape
the
accuser
and
not
to
give
an
account
of
your
lives
but
that
will
not
be
as
you
suppose
far
otherwise
for
i
say
that
there
will
be
more
accusers
of
you
than
there
are
now
accusers
whom
hitherto
i
have
restrained
and
as
they
are
younger
they
will
be
more
inconsiderate
with
you
and
you
will
be
more
offended
at
them
if
you
think
that
by
killing
men
you
can
prevent
some
one
from
censuring
your
evil
lives
you
are
mistaken
that
is
not
a
way
of
escape
which
is
either
possible
or
honourable
the
easiest
and
the
noblest
way
is
not
to
be
disabling
others
but
to
be
improving
yourselves
this
is
the
prophecy
which
i
utter
before
my
departure
to
the
judges
who
have
condemned
me
friends
who
would
have
acquitted
me
i
would
like
also
to
talk
with
you
about
the
thing
which
has
come
to
pass
while
the
magistrates
are
busy
and
before
i
go
to
the
place
at
which
i
must
die
stay
then
a
little
for
we
may
as
well
talk
with
one
another
while
there
is
time
you
are
my
friends
and
i
should
like
to
show
you
the
meaning
of
this
event
which
has
happened
to
me
o
my
judges
for
you
i
may
truly
call
judges
i
should
like
to
tell
you
of
a
wonderful
circumstance
hitherto
the
divine
faculty
of
which
the
internal
oracle
is
the
source
has
constantly
been
in
the
habit
of
opposing
me
even
about
trifles
if
i
was
going
to
make
a
slip
or
error
in
any
matter
and
now
as
you
see
there
has
come
upon
me
that
which
may
be
thought
and
is
generally
believed
to
be
the
last
and
worst
evil
but
the
oracle
made
no
sign
of
opposition
either
when
i
was
leaving
my
house
in
the
morning
or
when
i
was
on
my
way
to
the
court
or
while
i
was
speaking
at
anything
which
i
was
going
to
say
and
yet
i
have
often
been
stopped
in
the
middle
of
a
speech
but
now
in
nothing
i
either
said
or
did
touching
the
matter
in
hand
has
the
oracle
opposed
me
what
do
i
take
to
be
the
explanation
of
this
silence
i
will
tell
you
it
is
an
intimation
that
what
has
happened
to
me
is
a
good
and
that
those
of
us
who
think
that
death
is
an
evil
are
in
error
for
the
customary
sign
would
surely
have
opposed
me
had
i
been
going
to
evil
and
not
to
good
let
us
reflect
in
another
way
and
we
shall
see
that
there
is
great
reason
to
hope
that
death
is
a
good
for
one
of
two
things
either
death
is
a
state
of
nothingness
and
utter
unconsciousness
or
as
men
say
there
is
a
change
and
migration
of
the
soul
from
this
world
to
another
now
if
you
suppose
that
there
is
no
consciousness
but
a
sleep
like
the
sleep
of
him
who
is
undisturbed
even
by
dreams
death
will
be
an
unspeakable
gain
for
if
a
person
were
to
select
the
night
in
which
his
sleep
was
undisturbed
even
by
dreams
and
were
to
compare
with
this
the
other
days
and
nights
of
his
life
and
then
were
to
tell
us
how
many
days
and
nights
he
had
passed
in
the
course
of
his
life
better
and
more
pleasantly
than
this
one
i
think
that
any
man
i
will
not
say
a
private
man
but
even
the
great
king
will
not
find
many
such
days
or
nights
when
compared
with
the
others
now
if
death
be
of
such
a
nature
i
say
that
to
die
is
gain
for
eternity
is
then
only
a
single
night
but
if
death
is
the
journey
to
another
place
and
there
as
men
say
all
the
dead
abide
what
good
o
my
friends
and
judges
can
be
greater
than
this
if
indeed
when
the
pilgrim
arrives
in
the
world
below
he
is
delivered
from
the
professors
of
justice
in
this
world
and
finds
the
true
judges
who
are
said
to
give
judgment
there
minos
and
rhadamanthus
and
aeacus
and
triptolemus
and
other
sons
of
god
who
were
righteous
in
their
own
life
that
pilgrimage
will
be
worth
making
what
would
not
a
man
give
if
he
might
converse
with
orpheus
and
musaeus
and
hesiod
and
homer
nay
if
this
be
true
let
me
die
again
and
again
i
myself
too
shall
have
a
wonderful
interest
in
there
meeting
and
conversing
with
palamedes
and
ajax
the
son
of
telamon
and
any
other
ancient
hero
who
has
suffered
death
through
an
unjust
judgment
and
there
will
be
no
small
pleasure
as
i
think
in
comparing
my
own
sufferings
with
theirs
above
all
i
shall
then
be
able
to
continue
my
search
into
true
and
false
knowledge
as
in
this
world
so
also
in
the
next
and
i
shall
find
out
who
is
wise
and
who
pretends
to
be
wise
and
is
not
what
would
not
a
man
give
o
judges
to
be
able
to
examine
the
leader
of
the
great
trojan
expedition
or
odysseus
or
sisyphus
or
numberless
others
men
and
women
too
what
infinite
delight
would
there
be
in
conversing
with
them
and
asking
them
questions
in
another
world
they
do
not
put
a
man
to
death
for
asking
questions
assuredly
not
for
besides
being
happier
than
we
are
they
will
be
immortal
if
what
is
said
is
true
wherefore
o
judges
be
of
good
cheer
about
death
and
know
of
a
certainty
that
no
evil
can
happen
to
a
good
man
either
in
life
or
after
death
he
and
his
are
not
neglected
by
the
gods
nor
has
my
own
approaching
end
happened
by
mere
chance
but
i
see
clearly
that
the
time
had
arrived
when
it
was
better
for
me
to
die
and
be
released
from
trouble
wherefore
the
oracle
gave
no
sign
for
which
reason
also
i
am
not
angry
with
my
condemners
or
with
my
accusers
they
have
done
me
no
harm
although
they
did
not
mean
to
do
me
any
good
and
for
this
i
may
gently
blame
them
still
i
have
a
favour
to
ask
of
them
when
my
sons
are
grown
up
i
would
ask
you
o
my
friends
to
punish
them
and
i
would
have
you
trouble
them
as
i
have
troubled
you
if
they
seem
to
care
about
riches
or
anything
more
than
about
virtue
or
if
they
pretend
to
be
something
when
they
are
really
nothing
then
reprove
them
as
i
have
reproved
you
for
not
caring
about
that
for
which
they
ought
to
care
and
thinking
that
they
are
something
when
they
are
really
nothing
and
if
you
do
this
both
i
and
my
sons
will
have
received
justice
at
your
hands
the
hour
of
departure
has
arrived
and
we
go
our
ways
i
to
die
and
you
to
live
which
is
better
god
only
knows
