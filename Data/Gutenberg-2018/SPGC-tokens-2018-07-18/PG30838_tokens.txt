my
introduction
it
is
always
a
task
of
much
difficulty
to
select
an
experience
of
from
among
the
many
which
have
been
set
down
in
the
records
under
his
name
a
maze
of
episodes
in
these
records
attracts
the
mind
and
one
finds
there
a
train
of
singular
adventures
any
one
of
which
would
make
a
book
the
experiences
which
go
to
make
up
the
volume
investigator
were
chosen
because
they
dealt
with
a
rather
arabesque
murder
the
hidden
features
of
which
were
brought
to
light
in
an
extraordinary
way
in
secret
agent
the
elements
seemed
uniquely
mixed
and
shed
an
unusual
light
upon
the
windings
of
european
diplomacy
in
the
third
volume
special
detective
the
note
of
horror
was
rung
shrilly
and
the
confident
talents
of
this
extraordinary
young
man
were
brought
smartly
into
play
it
may
be
that
the
appearance
in
this
history
of
the
detective
big
friend
bat
scanlon
had
something
to
do
with
its
finding
a
place
in
this
series
in
the
present
book
this
engaging
personality
has
again
a
part
in
the
drama
but
aside
from
this
influence
the
episode
makes
a
powerful
appeal
the
brilliancy
of
the
criminologist
work
in
the
case
treated
here
would
surely
have
compelled
a
place
for
it

he
was
steadfastly
watching

loaded

lifted
the
blade
once
more
then
the
door
swung
open
chapter
i
the
gathering
cloud
impatiently
threw
down
the
last
of
the
morning
newspapers
commonplace
said
he
and
sordid
i
am
inclined
to
agree
with
de
quincey
that
the
age
of
great
criminals
has
passed
the
man
to
whom
he
spoke
sat
opposite
him
in
the
lounging
room
of
scanlon
gymnasium
a
pair
of
puffy
white
hands
were
folded
over
a
bloated
paunch
he
had
a
sodden
air
of
and
and
a
good
job
too
spoke
this
gentleman
we
can
get
along
very
well
without
those
fellows
i
am
not
sure
that
i
quite
agree
with
that
said
he
lighted
a
cigar
and
its
smoke
drifted
across
the
high
ceilinged
room
crimes
are
growing
no
fewer
and
if
we
must
have
crimes
i
should
personally
prefer
their
perpetrators
to
have
some
little
artistry
the
swollen
gentleman
grunted
you
were
always
an
odd
kind
of
fish
said
he
but
you
know
every
one
has
your
love
of
this
kind
of
thing
they
have
not
given
it
the
same
amount
of
consideration
that
is
all
an
artist
in
crime
is
in
his
way
well
worthy
of
a
certain
sort
of
admiration
who
could
drive
a
knife
in
a
man
back
with
a
braver
air
of
deviltry
than
benvenuto
cellini
and
yet
he
could
turn
himself
from
the
deed
and
devote
himself
to
the
producing
of
a
perseus
or
to
playing
the
flute
well
enough
to
attract
the
attention
of
a
pope
and
his
own
countrymen
the
borgias
had
as
pretty
a
talent
for
assassination
as
they
had
for
government
very
like
admitted
the
other
but
ai
we
well
rid
of
such
bloodthirsty
apes
smiled
i
wonder
said
he
if
you
have
ever
read
an
engaging
little
volume
called
book
of
scoundrels
no
well
i
was
afraid
that
would
be
so
and
you
have
missed
a
treat
however
i
suppose
we
ca
expect
every
one
to
enthuse
over
such
things
it
has
been
said
of
music
that
the
ability
to
appreciate
it
is
only
second
to
that
of
being
able
to
produce
it
and
this
must
also
be
true
in
the
case
of
crime
stevenson
now
had
a
magnificent
appreciation
for
a
well
executed
enormity
in
his
story
he
gives
a
skilful
picture
of
a
really
deft
assassination
and
in
the
club
he
has
created
what
i
would
class
as
a
master
criminal
the
russian
writers
have
a
power
in
this
mood
that
is
truly
wonderful
dostoyeffsky
in
his
and
punishment
has
conceived
a
most
tremendous
homicide
one
which
would
have
thrilled
de
quincey
himself
the
listener
held
up
one
pudgy
hand
in
protest
do
he
requested
please
do
no
more
if
you
knew
what
gone
through
you
would
dwell
on
this
theme
just
then
a
very
big
man
with
massive
shoulders
and
chest
came
in
he
was
about
but
he
looked
pink
and
swift
and
fit
and
as
he
paused
at
the
side
of
the
heavy
paunched
one
the
latter
looked
physically
shabby
in
contrast
hello
bat
scanlon
trainer
champion
and
border
character
greeted
with
a
pleased
look
glad
to
see
you
come
in
to
dust
off
the
mat
with
me
i
think
i
will
take
a
turn
replied
the
criminologist
as
he
yawned
with
widely
stretched
arms
i
been
going
a
bit
stale
lately
scanlon
turned
his
glance
upon
the
other
man
how
are
you
mr
dennison
he
said
back
once
more
eh
believe
me
it
not
because
i
want
to
returned
dennison
huskily
it
because
i
have
to
i
not
right
scanlon
i
ca
stand
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
just
a
little
extra
tax
on
me
and
i
done
bat
surveyed
him
valuingly
no
wonder
said
he
you
got
a
belt
of
felt
about
your
waist
that
only
a
champion
could
wear
you
must
have
kept
your
feet
under
the
table
many
and
many
a
bitter
hour
to
win
it
now
confound
it
said
the
pudgy
one
exasperated
i
do
eat
so
much
maybe
not
scanlon
looked
his
disbelief
but
the
pangs
of
hunger
and
you
are
not
very
intimate
your
most
active
moments
are
spent
in
a
limousine
or
a
club
window
he
winked
humorously
at
say
nothing
against
the
limousine
it
a
fine
invention
but
legs
were
made
to
walk
on
and
if
you
think
the
club
window
thing
will
ever
reduce
the
size
of
your
collar
you
bound
to
be
a
disappointed
man
but
i
ride
every
day
in
the
park
said
dennison
and
i
go
to
the
country
club
three
times
a
week
for
my
golf
riding
is
a
grand
exercise
for
the
horse
commented
the
athlete
and
the
people
who
get
the
most
out
of
a
golf
course
are
paid
for
what
they
do
well
a
fellow
social
life
must
be
seen
to
said
the
defective
one
a
fat
white
hand
stroking
an
equally
fat
but
blue
jowl
he
got
to
have
a
bit
to
eat
and
drink
and
a
trifle
of
leisure
to
look
things
over
a
telephone
bell
rang
in
another
room
and
a
squeaky
voice
was
heard
answering
the
call
if
you
care
to
come
in
every
day
and
work
all
right
said
scanlon
carelessly
for
he
understood
the
case
perfectly
but
the
eating
and
drinking
must
scale
down
to
what
i
think
is
right
dennison
appealed
to
the
last
time
he
had
me
here
he
made
me
toil
like
a
day
laborer
and
feed
like
his
helper
said
he
gloomily
but
i
got
to
stand
it
confound
the
luck
i
too
short
in
the
neck
to
carry
weight
and
stand
excitement
that
thing
fairly
floored
me
when
i
heard
it
this
morning
what
thing
asked
dennison
looked
at
the
speaker
as
though
astonished
that
any
one
could
be
for
even
a
moment
in
doubt
as
to
his
meaning
why
said
he
that
murder
last
night
i
guess
that
one
i
have
heard
about
said
bat
scanlon
and
regarded
the
man
with
the
paunch
steadily
but
said
nothing
not
heard
of
that
the
man
pointed
an
amazed
finger
at
the
discarded
heap
about
the
investigator
chair
why
every
paper
in
town
is
just
screaming
about
it
the
police
are
at
a
standstill
the
papers
say
they
do
know
what
to
do
just
then
a
door
opened
a
fiery
head
was
thrust
into
the
room
and
a
squeaky
called
out
scanlon
on
the
when
he
reached
the
little
office
which
opened
from
the
lounging
room
the
boy
further
informed
bat
it
a
lady
and
she
sounds
like
she
was
in
a
hurry
scanlon
went
to
the
telephone
and
took
down
the
receiver
scanlon
speaking
said
he
briefly
there
came
a
gasping
breathless
little
exclamation
of
relief
in
his
ear
oh
bat
i
glad
you
there
i
very
glad
the
voice
was
full
and
vibrant
it
had
a
rare
quality
of
resonance
that
even
the
telephone
could
not
stifle
what
nora
is
that
you
the
big
athlete
was
plainly
surprised
yes
it
nora
replied
the
voice
foolish
nora
cavanaugh
who
is
always
in
some
sort
of
trouble
i
had
left
word
that
i
must
not
be
worried
by
this
matter
because
i
have
my
work
to
think
of
and
the
constant
ringing
at
the
and
telephoning
was
wearing
me
out
and
just
now
bat
it
occurred
to
me
that
you
would
be
sure
to
have
heard
of
this
dreadful
thing
and
have
been
one
of
those
turned
away
scanlon
face
was
one
of
mystification
and
concern
nora
said
he
why
this
rush
of
folks
at
your
front
door
and
who
were
they
the
reporters
have
never
stopped
since
early
morning
and
the
police
have
been
here
a
half
dozen
times
the
police
bat
voice
rose
with
a
sudden
sharpness
that
caused
the
boy
to
jump
what
do
you
mean
by
but
the
full
beautiful
voice
checked
him
i
must
see
you
bat
i
must
see
you
at
once
it
said
no
no
come
here
hurriedly
as
he
began
proposing
such
a
venture
there
is
a
cab
waiting
at
the
door
now
i
shall
be
at
your
place
in
twenty
minutes
all
right
nora
anything
you
say
but
if
you
only
let
me
in
twenty
minutes
said
the
rare
voice
the
blank
which
followed
told
him
that
the
girl
had
hung
up
he
turned
to
the
boy
danny
said
he
there
be
a
lady
along
in
a
little
while
have
her
come
in
here
and
let
me
know
right
away
yes
sir
said
danny
obligingly
with
his
brows
puckered
in
perplexity
bat
went
back
to
the
lounging
room
was
looking
out
at
the
crowds
passing
in
the
street
dennison
was
reading
a
blackly
headlined
story
on
the
front
page
of
one
of
the
newspapers
his
pudgy
hands
shaking
and
his
eyes
feverish
the
worst
thing
of
the
kind
i
ever
heard
of
said
he
with
a
kind
of
gurgle
of
horror
the
very
worst
the
police
have
been
bragging
about
their
efficiency
during
this
last
administration
now
let
see
what
they
can
do
here
a
case
that
try
them
out
oh
yes
said
bat
absently
you
were
talking
about
being
upset
by
this
thing
it
was
he
paused
suddenly
remembering
that
he
had
not
yet
heard
a
murder
said
the
detective
as
he
threw
down
the
newspaper
a
most
brutal
and
devilish
murder
i
talked
with
tom
burton
last
night
only
a
few
hours
before
this
terrible
thing
must
have
happened
tom
burton
scanlon
big
ruddy
face
went
a
little
pale
not
the
yes
they
did
call
him
that
confessed
the
other
a
little
resentfully
but
that
was
all
wrong
burton
was
a
good
fellow
when
you
knew
him
but
bat
scanlon
was
not
listening
he
had
snatched
up
one
of
the
newspapers
in
staring
he
was
reading
mysteriously
struck
down
strange
deed
at
stanwick
burton
man
about
town
the
are
puzzled
in
the
body
of
the
type
the
hurried
details
of
the
crime
were
given
or
as
many
of
them
as
the
journal
had
been
able
to
gather
before
going
to
press
stanwick
was
a
new
suburb
on
a
branch
line
and
some
time
after
midnight
a
policeman
colby
by
name
had
been
patrolling
his
beat
which
was
along
duncan
street
a
girl
in
the
dress
of
a
nurse
and
much
frightened
rushed
up
to
him
and
in
great
agitation
announced
that
there
was
a
man
lying
dead
on
the
floor
at
colby
startled
and
excited
accompanied
the
girl
to
the
house
indicated
and
there
found
the
body
of
thomas
burton
a
clubman
stretched
out
upon
the
floor
of
the
dead
and
with
a
frightful
wound
in
the
head
the
house
is
occupied
by
frank
burton
the
cartoonist
for
the
and
his
sister
mary
who
has
been
an
invalid
for
some
years
these
are
the
son
and
daughter
of
the
dead
man
they
say
they
had
not
up
to
last
night
seen
their
father
for
a
long
time
his
visit
was
a
surprise
and
not
at
all
a
welcome
one
it
would
appear
as
they
had
not
been
upon
good
terms
according
to
the
story
told
by
young
burton
he
and
his
sister
left
the
room
in
which
their
father
sat
when
the
young
man
returned
he
found
his
father
dead
as
stated
paper
after
paper
was
feverishly
scanned
by
bat
but
they
merely
repeated
the
few
bare
facts
had
turned
from
the
window
and
was
watching
the
big
trainer
in
some
surprise
it
a
pretty
hard
pull
for
a
man
when
he
talked
comfortably
with
a
friend
and
said
to
him
and
then
the
next
thing
he
hears
is
that
he
been
outrageously
murdered
dennison
seemed
unable
to
rid
his
mind
of
this
overpowering
fact
it
was
then
i
started
to
go
under
it
was
just
as
if
somebody
had
struck
me
under
the
heart
and
i
caved
right
in
here
there
came
a
sudden
bustle
from
the
office
the
closing
of
doors
the
dragging
of
a
chair
across
the
floor
then
the
voice
of
danny
came
squeakingly
scanlon
wanted
in
the
office
right
said
bat
promptly
then
to
he
added
stick
around
for
a
little
will
you
i
may
have
something
to
tell
you
and
then
with
hurried
steps
he
vanished
into
the
adjoining
room
chapter
ii
bat
scanlon
is
surprised
in
the
office
bat
scanlon
felt
himself
suddenly
clutched
by
a
creature
who
seemed
at
first
to
be
all
rich
silks
soft
furs
dazzling
complexion
and
delicate
perfume
but
an
instant
later
this
impression
failed
for
he
knew
that
she
was
all
eyes
great
brown
intelligent
eyes
and
a
voice
which
made
one
heart
tremble
when
she
spoke
oh
bat
i
glad
you
in
this
big
cold
city
this
morning
said
the
voice
gratefully
while
the
long
lashes
held
two
great
perilous
tears
if
you
had
been
i
do
know
what
i
should
have
done
danny
said
bat
to
the
boy
go
sweep
up
or
something
yes
sir
replied
danny
promptly
and
was
gone
scanlon
then
saw
that
his
unusual
visitor
was
settled
comfortably
in
a
big
chair
and
he
took
a
seat
opposite
her
i
do
wonder
that
you
feeling
so
said
he
it
a
sudden
kind
of
thing
is
it
and
do
you
know
there
was
an
apologetic
note
in
his
voice
this
is
the
first
morning
i
missed
looking
over
the
paper
for
months
when
you
had
me
on
the
telephone
a
while
ago
i
knew
nothing
at
all
about
the
matter
the
girl
shivered
a
little
and
drew
her
cloak
around
her
shoulders
as
soon
as
heard
of
it
i
knew
what
was
to
happen
she
said
a
trifle
bitterly
nora
cavanaugh
celebrity
was
to
be
dragged
further
into
the
light
nora
cavanaugh
who
had
just
opened
in
a
successful
play
the
woman
whose
pictures
were
in
all
the
magazines
was
the
wife
of
the
murdered
man
instantly
the
police
who
would
be
much
better
employed
seeking
a
solution
of
the
crime
must
hunt
out
and
torment
me
with
their
questions
the
newspapers
must
suddenly
go
mad
with
a
desire
to
exploit
my
years
of
work
and
my
personality
as
a
background
for
a
sordid
crime
my
press
agent
my
manager
are
quivering
with
anxiety
that
no
shred
of
publicity
be
lost
my
very
maid
is
subtly
suggestive
as
to
ways
in
which
value
could
be
gained
from
the
circumstances
too
bad
said
bat
it
a
pretty
messy
kind
of
a
job
but
it
the
regular
thing
they
are
not
picking
specially
on
you
he
sat
looking
at
her
for
a
moment
in
silence
then
he
added
anyhow
in
spite
of
all
this
there
is
one
thing
you
might
be
thankful
for
is
there
she
drew
in
a
long
breath
her
hands
clasped
tightly
and
for
a
moment
her
eyes
were
closed
you
mean
that
tom
burton
is
dead
she
whispered
yes
said
the
man
again
there
was
a
silence
and
this
time
it
was
broken
by
the
girl
i
have
never
thought
of
him
as
dying
she
said
and
there
was
something
like
wonder
in
her
voice
he
had
gradually
become
settled
in
my
mind
as
a
sort
of
incubus
i
felt
that
i
was
to
see
him
always
smiling
immaculate
and
unscrupulous
a
sort
of
beast
with
whom
cleanliness
took
the
place
of
a
soul
you
should
have
divorced
him
said
bat
it
would
have
been
the
easiest
way
she
shivered
he
knew
i
would
never
do
that
she
answered
he
knew
i
was
forever
set
against
any
such
thing
my
religion
is
against
it
then
she
gave
a
little
gesture
of
loathing
the
actress
and
the
divorce
court
had
become
associated
in
common
jest
and
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
not
add
to
its
truth
he
knew
that
and
he
took
advantage
of
it
said
bat
was
there
anything
that
promised
him
a
profit
that
tom
burton
did
not
take
advantage
of
her
glorious
eyes
flashed
and
her
head
superbly
crowned
with
masses
of
bronze
hair
was
reared
the
round
beautifully
moulded
chin
was
held
high
with
scorn
was
there
anything
no
matter
how
mean
that
he
would
stoop
to
so
long
as
it
enabled
him
to
coddle
his
vices
and
go
on
in
his
idle
way
of
life
bat
sat
looking
at
the
wonderfully
beautiful
and
splendidly
spirited
creature
and
he
found
himself
wondering
what
had
ever
led
her
into
a
marriage
with
a
man
such
as
the
one
she
had
just
described
and
as
though
in
answer
to
his
thought
she
went
on
but
he
had
a
way
with
him
his
only
study
in
life
so
he
told
me
once
had
been
women
and
he
knew
how
to
get
the
better
of
them
when
i
first
met
him
i
was
playing
in
a
middle
western
city
in
a
stock
company
which
gave
two
performances
a
day
and
paid
a
fairly
respectable
salary
it
was
the
first
good
engagement
i
ever
had
the
following
of
the
theatre
liked
me
and
i
began
to
be
talked
about
the
east
and
the
creating
of
important
parts
did
not
seem
so
impossible
as
they
had
only
a
little
while
before
maybe
he
heard
some
whisper
of
this
i
do
know
but
we
became
acquainted
and
i
was
carried
away
by
him
never
had
i
met
a
man
who
showed
so
many
brilliant
sides
of
character
he
could
talk
about
anything
and
in
a
way
which
indicated
a
mastery
of
the
matter
every
ambition
i
cherished
met
with
his
approval
everything
i
longed
for
seemed
within
reach
when
he
talked
it
was
a
species
of
hypnotism
bat
nothing
else
explains
it
how
a
fellow
like
that
could
so
put
it
over
on
a
woman
like
you
nora
puzzles
me
said
bat
scanlon
shaking
his
head
it
would
puzzle
any
right
sort
of
a
man
said
the
girl
only
a
woman
would
understand
it
thoroughly
or
a
man
like
tom
burton
well
it
was
while
i
was
feeling
that
way
about
him
completely
under
his
influence
that
i
married
him
and
in
a
week
here
she
arose
the
cloak
falling
from
her
shoulders
as
she
flung
out
her
arms
in
a
gesture
of
despair
i
knew
just
what
i
had
done
the
man
was
a
cheap
pretender
he
never
had
an
honest
thought
in
his
life
he
had
familiarized
himself
with
all
my
little
weaknesses
and
aspirations
before
he
met
me
all
his
learning
was
a
sham
his
good
nature
was
a
mask
some
discovery
for
a
week
old
bride
to
make
acknowledged
bat
frowning
some
discovery
he
was
a
man
who
lived
by
his
wits
it
was
common
report
that
he
been
expelled
from
a
club
somewhere
for
cheating
at
cards
his
first
wife
had
died
a
long
time
before
through
his
studied
neglect
and
bad
treatment
he
had
heard
of
my
good
salary
and
increasing
prospects
and
so
had
made
up
his
mind
to
attach
himself
after
the
manner
of
all
parasites
to
one
who
promised
to
be
a
source
of
income
was
it
then
that
you
left
him
asked
the
man
it
was
she
bent
her
head
the
white
hands
covered
her
face
her
bosom
deep
and
wonderful
as
that
of
a
young
juno
rose
and
fell
with
the
sobs
that
shook
her
i
thought
i
should
die
at
first
to
think
that
i
who
had
prized
myself
so
should
come
to
that
made
the
victim
of
such
a
cheap
tawdry
trick
once
or
twice
i
actually
thought
of
killing
myself
but
i
suppose
i
am
too
normal
for
that
at
any
rate
within
another
week
i
had
thrown
aside
every
tie
i
had
and
they
were
not
many
with
a
little
added
break
in
the
voice
over
which
she
was
struggling
for
control
and
so
i
came
east
but
that
was
the
last
you
saw
of
burton
though
said
bat
with
a
grimace
of
dislike
while
i
was
fighting
to
make
a
fresh
way
for
myself
he
did
not
disturb
me
said
the
girl
but
no
sooner
had
i
scored
than
he
reappeared
by
every
device
known
to
his
kind
he
began
to
bleed
me
you
did
not
allow
that
cried
the
man
surprised
i
did
with
a
gesture
of
meek
acknowledgment
he
mastered
me
with
his
cunning
not
a
thing
escaped
him
every
weakness
every
shrinking
every
faltering
i
had
seemed
known
to
him
he
kept
me
in
an
agony
of
suspense
rather
than
be
hampered
and
embarrassed
by
him
at
every
turn
i
tried
to
get
rid
of
him
by
giving
him
money
it
would
take
near
all
the
money
in
the
world
to
drive
away
a
coyote
like
that
said
bat
i
soon
found
that
out
said
nora
cavanaugh
for
from
that
time
on
i
was
haunted
by
him
he
kept
demanding
of
me
and
i
never
had
the
moral
courage
to
refuse
him
until
last
night
last
night
bat
found
himself
staring
at
her
did
you
see
him
last
night
she
looked
at
him
suddenly
and
there
was
a
startled
sort
of
look
in
the
wide
brown
eyes
a
fleeting
expression
of
fear
and
at
the
same
time
her
hand
went
to
her
breast
in
a
convulsive
movement
yes
she
said
and
her
voice
had
sunk
to
a
whisper
he
came
last
night
after
i
returned
from
the
theatre
my
maid
had
instructions
not
to
admit
him
but
he
pushed
her
aside
and
came
directly
to
my
room
you
right
said
bat
scanlon
glowering
he
a
way
with
him
it
a
pity
you
had
a
brother
or
some
one
all
these
years
to
take
care
of
you
his
study
of
women
would
have
done
him
little
good
if
he
had
had
a
man
to
meet
he
wanted
money
said
nora
he
was
wheedling
and
threatening
by
turns
he
did
everything
he
had
ever
done
before
and
more
i
do
know
what
gave
me
the
resolution
perhaps
it
was
the
way
he
forced
his
presence
upon
me
but
anyhow
i
refused
him
he
went
away
empty
handed
said
scanlon
gleefully
good
i
gave
him
nothing
said
nora
and
i
think
he
saw
in
my
attitude
what
the
future
was
to
be
for
when
he
left
me
he
wore
a
look
i
had
never
seen
upon
his
face
before
well
and
the
big
trainer
expelled
a
great
breath
it
wo
make
much
difference
now
what
he
thought
he
never
bother
you
again
no
she
repeated
he
never
bother
me
again
never
the
beautiful
voice
quavered
and
grew
faint
as
she
said
this
and
the
hand
was
still
held
tightly
against
her
breast
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
nora
said
the
man
a
fellow
who
was
brought
up
outside
as
i
have
been
is
not
much
at
comforting
a
woman
bat
said
the
girl
and
the
hand
left
her
breast
and
rested
upon
his
arm
it
has
eased
my
heart
just
to
hear
you
speak
you
were
always
good
to
me
always
but
you
have
given
me
courage
when
i
needed
it
so
badly
there
was
a
little
pause
she
came
closer
to
him
and
now
both
her
hands
were
upon
his
arm
the
two
beautiful
capable
hands
whose
whiteness
had
always
amazed
him
the
faint
perfume
which
always
clung
about
her
was
in
his
nostrils
and
the
brown
eyes
so
perfectly
spaced
so
wonderfully
colored
were
opened
wide
and
regarding
him
steadily
there
are
two
things
i
want
you
to
do
bat
she
said
and
they
are
not
at
all
difficult
you
are
acquainted
in
the
detective
department
and
i
wish
you
would
ask
them
not
to
bother
me
any
more
if
they
do
and
here
he
felt
the
two
white
hands
flutter
and
heard
her
breath
drawn
in
sharply
i
shall
break
down
with
fright
i
fix
it
the
man
assured
her
leave
it
to
me
thank
you
bat
you
the
best
creature
in
the
world
she
said
gratefully
and
too
i
want
you
to
go
to
stanwick
i
would
like
you
to
see
what
the
police
are
doing
everything
you
can
they
must
have
found
out
something
by
this
time
ask
questions
and
keep
your
eyes
open
and
when
you
have
it
all
come
to
me
at
once
and
let
me
know
sure
said
he
i
go
right
away
thank
you
she
drew
the
rich
cloak
about
her
and
then
held
out
her
hand
you
a
dear
good
fellow
bat
i
always
known
that
but
now
i
surer
of
it
than
ever
why
nora
it
not
hard
to
do
things
for
you
said
he
as
he
held
the
hand
for
a
moment
and
you
hurry
her
eyes
were
full
of
pleading
you
find
out
everything
you
can
but
you
hurry
wo
you
as
soon
as
i
looked
things
over
carefully
said
he
you
hear
me
at
your
door
thank
you
again
she
said
and
and
as
the
door
closed
behind
her
bat
scanlon
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
his
arms
folded
across
his
big
chest
cop
stuff
said
he
to
himself
what
do
you
think
of
that
when
he
returned
once
more
to
the
room
in
which
he
had
left
the
others
scanlon
found
dennison
buttoning
up
his
i
be
in
said
the
man
and
my
togs
will
be
sent
around
when
he
had
departed
scanlon
looked
at
i
guess
you
have
to
take
your
with
the
big
greek
said
he
stanwick
my
next
stop
and
i
going
to
get
the
first
train
stanwick
keen
eyes
regarded
him
inquiringly
funny
thing
ai
it
here
i
did
know
a
thing
about
this
murder
and
then
i
get
it
piled
in
on
me
from
two
places
that
was
tom
wife
just
in
to
see
me
nora
cavanaugh
oh
yes
to
be
sure
she
is
or
was
his
wife
was
she
she
had
a
fine
lot
of
excitement
with
her
dennison
ai
the
only
one
who
saw
burton
last
night
he
called
on
nora
after
the
show
and
wanted
money
as
it
seems
he
always
did
but
she
refused
him
and
he
went
away
sore
he
was
an
utter
scamp
said
it
rather
remarkable
though
how
he
managed
to
keep
just
outside
the
reach
of
the
law
nora
been
pestered
by
the
cops
and
she
wants
me
to
have
them
called
off
said
bat
and
she
asked
me
to
go
out
to
stanwick
and
see
what
they
are
doing
there
the
police
yes
i
do
know
just
what
it
all
about
but
nora
knows
and
enough
for
me
smiled
as
the
big
man
went
to
a
closet
and
took
out
a
long
coat
and
a
soft
hat
miss
cavanaugh
is
fortunate
in
the
control
of
such
an
obedient
geni
said
he
quietly
but
good
luck
on
your
trip
and
while
you
are
gone
i
grapple
with
the
greek
as
you
suggest
chapter
iii
the
cloud
grows
darker
stanwick
was
a
made
suburb
ten
years
before
its
site
had
been
occupied
by
farms
but
a
realty
man
had
seen
promise
in
it
and
bought
it
up
shrewdly
the
streets
were
wide
the
walks
were
narrow
and
lined
with
trees
that
would
one
day
spread
nobly
the
houses
were
built
in
rows
each
independent
of
the
other
mounted
upon
little
terraces
fronted
by
guards
of
iron
railing
and
prim
little
flower
gardens
bat
scanlon
as
he
regarded
it
nodded
knowingly
it
the
kind
of
a
place
where
the
is
the
chief
topic
in
the
morning
and
the
in
the
afternoon
he
told
himself
the
habits
of
the
rubber
plant
are
common
property
and
every
man
in
every
street
thinks
his
roses
have
it
all
over
the
man
next
door
duncan
street
proved
much
like
the
others
and
no
had
all
the
characteristics
to
be
expected
of
it
when
scanlon
stopped
before
it
he
found
a
little
group
of
idlers
standing
on
the
walk
each
member
of
which
stared
at
him
with
a
curiosity
that
was
active
and
acute
hello
kelly
saluted
bat
as
he
recognized
a
portly
policeman
at
the
little
iron
gate
how
are
you
bat
responded
the
policeman
in
a
surprised
tone
what
are
you
doing
away
out
here
just
thought
i
run
out
and
take
a
look
around
said
scanlon
he
had
seen
to
the
training
of
the
athletic
team
of
the
police
department
for
several
years
and
was
well
known
to
most
of
the
officials
and
many
of
the
patrolmen
and
it
just
happened
that
the
man
on
guard
at
the
gate
due
to
bat
instructions
had
been
the
winner
of
the
heavyweight
wrestling
honors
in
the
last
tournament
anything
new
i
have
heard
anything
replied
kelly
osborne
from
headquarters
went
in
a
few
minutes
ago
with
the
coroner
assistant
the
sergeant
and
a
couple
of
men
have
been
here
all
morning
bat
opened
the
gate
and
went
slowly
up
the
path
the
house
was
a
bright
place
the
little
garden
was
laid
out
in
walks
the
trees
were
carefully
trimmed
and
though
it
was
still
october
everything
had
been
made
ready
for
the
winter
season
nice
little
home
commented
the
big
man
shows
care
and
thoughtfulness
no
place
at
all
for
a
murder
in
reply
to
his
ring
the
door
was
opened
by
a
second
policeman
a
few
words
brought
the
sergeant
in
charge
to
the
door
and
he
shook
hands
with
scanlon
and
asked
him
to
step
in
any
interest
in
this
case
he
asked
and
his
broad
red
face
displayed
a
great
deal
of
that
very
thing
is
your
friend
along
with
you
no
replied
bat
easily
he
not
but
from
what
i
hear
it
the
kind
of
a
thing
he
like
the
sergeant
shook
his
head
oh
between
you
and
me
it
simple
enough
said
he
the
newspapers
have
played
it
up
some
that
all
to
my
mind
the
party
that
croaked
burton
ai
out
of
reach
by
a
long
shot
and
if
they
have
left
it
to
me
i
had
him
at
city
hall
an
hour
ago
that
so
bat
looked
surprised
i
thought
it
was
one
of
those
things
all
bundled
up
in
mystery
he
went
slowly
down
the
hall
and
turned
in
at
the
first
door
to
the
left
which
stood
partly
open
and
from
behind
which
he
heard
voices
a
burly
looking
man
with
a
derby
hat
in
his
hand
was
talking
to
a
dapper
personage
whose
carefully
trimmed
beard
and
immaculately
white
waistcoat
gave
him
the
conventional
professional
look
near
a
window
was
a
big
chair
among
the
pillows
of
which
reclined
a
young
girl
with
a
pale
sweet
face
and
that
appearance
of
fragility
which
comes
of
illness
beside
her
stood
an
young
man
whose
haggard
countenance
told
of
a
sleepless
night
and
a
harassed
mind
scanlon
at
once
recognized
in
the
big
man
the
as
the
newspapers
always
put
it
city
detective
osborne
and
so
calmly
advanced
and
shook
his
hand
glad
to
see
you
spoke
osborne
affably
meet
shower
assistant
to
the
coroner
indicating
the
white
waistcoated
gentleman
these
investigations
are
not
exactly
the
thing
i
care
for
shower
told
osborne
after
acknowledging
the
presentation
graciously
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
they
are
entirely
within
the
duties
of
the
police
we
of
our
office
should
be
dragged
out
to
view
dead
bodies
in
all
sorts
of
places
it
consumes
a
great
deal
of
time
and
as
far
as
i
can
see
can
do
no
possible
good
osborne
shrugged
his
heavy
shoulders
well
doctor
spoke
he
maybe
you
got
it
right
but
when
old
costigan
was
coroner
he
always
insisted
that
a
body
especially
in
a
case
like
this
should
not
be
touched
until
he
had
looked
at
it
and
asked
his
questions
costigan
was
romantic
stated
shower
as
he
stroked
his
beard
with
a
firm
hand
he
had
imbibed
a
great
deal
of
theoretical
detective
nonsense
and
tried
to
act
up
to
it
however
with
a
lifting
of
one
eyebrow
here
i
am
so
i
might
as
well
get
to
work
he
looked
about
where
is
the
body
in
the
room
just
across
the
hall
said
osborne
just
so
shower
looked
at
the
young
man
and
the
young
woman
and
these
are
the
son
and
daughter
of
the
murdered
man
answered
the
detective
to
be
sure
shower
smoothed
his
waistcoat
with
the
same
firm
gesture
of
course
then
to
the
young
man
am
i
right
in
understanding
that
your
father
did
not
reside
here
the
young
man
laughed
suddenly
the
sound
was
unexpected
and
full
of
bitterness
and
caused
bat
scanlon
to
look
swiftly
toward
him
yes
you
are
quite
right
in
that
said
the
son
quite
right
my
father
did
live
here
there
was
a
feeling
behind
the
words
that
was
not
to
be
mistaken
and
a
slight
pucker
appeared
between
the
eyes
of
the
assistant
coroner
which
a
person
well
acquainted
with
him
would
have
told
you
indicated
increasing
interest
you
are
reported
to
have
said
to
the
police
sergeant
stated
shower
referring
to
some
memoranda
scribbled
upon
the
back
of
an
envelope
that
the
relationship
between
your
father
and
yourself
has
not
been
an
agreeable
one
there
has
been
no
relationship
between
my
father
and
myself
none
whatsoever
for
a
number
of
years
there
was
a
gleam
in
the
eyes
of
the
speaker
and
a
shaking
quality
in
his
voice
which
showed
intense
feeling
the
thin
hand
of
his
sister
rested
upon
his
arm
for
an
instant
he
looked
at
her
quickly
and
then
bent
over
while
she
whispered
something
in
a
tone
so
low
that
none
of
the
others
could
hear
a
word
very
well
mary
he
said
it
all
right
do
worry
what
you
say
being
the
case
said
shower
your
father
would
not
be
likely
to
be
a
frequent
visitor
we
lived
here
for
five
years
he
was
never
here
before
up
to
last
night
i
had
not
seen
him
for
at
least
seven
years
humph
the
pucker
between
the
assistant
coroner
eyes
deepened
he
took
a
firm
clutch
upon
his
beard
then
the
visit
of
last
night
was
quite
unusual
unique
i
might
say
he
was
the
last
person
in
the
world
i
expected
to
see
said
the
young
man
i
did
not
get
home
until
late
i
had
a
cartoon
to
do
for
the
sporting
page
and
ideas
were
not
flowing
very
easily
my
usual
train
is
at
but
i
was
held
up
until
the
as
i
came
down
the
street
i
saw
a
light
burning
in
the
window
but
i
thought
my
sister
was
waiting
for
me
as
she
sometimes
does
but
when
i
came
in
and
saw
my
father
with
her
i
was
so
astonished
that
for
a
moment
i
could
not
speak
just
so
and
now
here
the
hand
of
the
questioner
fell
to
caressing
the
trimmed
beard
tenderly
tell
me
this
your
father
visit
so
late
at
night
and
after
so
long
an
estrangement
must
have
had
some
special
reason
behind
it
would
you
mind
saying
what
it
was
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
bat
scanlon
saw
osborne
eyes
narrow
as
he
watched
the
young
man
he
saw
from
the
assistant
coroner
attitude
that
this
was
a
most
important
question
and
more
than
anything
else
he
saw
in
the
pale
sweet
face
of
the
invalid
girl
a
look
of
subdued
terror
the
fragile
hands
were
clasped
together
as
though
she
were
praying
and
at
length
young
burton
spoke
i
do
know
that
there
was
any
reason
for
the
visit
he
gave
me
none
shower
turned
upon
the
invalid
girl
quickly
did
he
say
anything
to
you
no
replied
the
girl
in
a
low
tone
no
he
said
nothing
what
did
he
talk
about
asked
osborne
i
do
not
know
said
the
girl
her
voice
even
fainter
than
before
i
never
understood
my
father
he
he
always
frightened
me
by
the
way
he
looked
and
the
way
he
laughed
she
sank
back
exhausted
among
the
pillows
her
brother
bent
over
and
spoke
soothingly
and
encouragingly
to
her
when
she
had
recovered
a
little
he
turned
once
more
to
the
others
and
scanlon
saw
a
bitter
anger
in
his
face
a
cold
hard
fury
such
as
only
comes
of
a
hurt
that
is
deep
and
long
rankled
you
heard
what
she
said
he
asked
she
never
understood
him
how
could
a
girl
like
her
understand
a
man
like
that
he
frightened
her
by
the
way
he
looked
and
the
way
he
laughed
do
you
know
what
that
means
it
a
thing
born
in
her
got
from
her
mother
a
mother
who
lived
in
fear
of
that
man
for
years
and
then
he
finally
drove
her
to
her
grave
he
was
a
monster
a
human
beast
he
had
no
more
remorse
than
frank
the
girl
faint
voice
checked
him
he
looked
down
at
her
the
same
expression
in
his
face
as
scanlon
had
seen
there
before
no
she
does
know
what
he
talked
about
the
young
man
resumed
in
a
lower
tone
and
with
a
quieter
manner
she
never
saw
him
in
her
life
but
what
she
almost
died
through
fear
of
him
with
a
gesture
the
assistant
coroner
seemed
to
put
aside
this
phase
of
the
matter
very
well
said
he
but
tell
us
please
what
happened
after
you
reached
home
last
night
and
saw
your
father
so
unexpectedly
i
was
angry
said
the
young
artist
i
asked
him
what
he
was
doing
here
and
then
what
he
merely
jeered
at
me
i
looked
at
my
sister
she
seemed
very
ill
and
i
understood
the
cause
of
it
at
once
and
tried
to
cross
toward
her
you
to
cross
the
room
said
osborne
what
was
to
prevent
you
my
father
tried
to
said
the
young
man
it
was
a
way
he
had
i
remember
it
from
a
boy
a
love
of
threatening
people
a
desire
to
mock
a
kind
of
joy
in
persecution
but
he
had
forgotten
that
i
had
grown
into
a
man
and
i
threw
him
out
of
my
way
as
soon
as
he
stepped
into
it
well
asked
the
questioner
after
a
pause
i
saw
that
my
sister
had
undergone
a
severe
strain
she
has
been
in
bad
health
for
some
years
so
i
took
her
at
once
to
her
room
your
father
remained
in
the
yes
at
least
i
suppose
so
for
when
i
returned
perhaps
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
i
found
him
lying
upon
the
floor
just
as
he
is
now
the
blood
from
a
wound
in
his
head
was
soaking
into
a
rug
and
he
was
quite
dead
a
quarter
of
an
hour
elapsed
between
your
leaving
the
room
and
your
return
yes
during
that
time
you
heard
no
unusual
sounds
no
what
other
occupants
are
there
here
beside
you
two
a
maid
who
also
does
the
cooking
and
there
is
a
nurse
who
has
been
attending
my
sister
for
some
time
past
bring
them
here
said
shower
to
the
policeman
who
had
been
standing
at
the
room
door
during
the
greater
part
of
this
examination
as
the
man
departed
the
assistant
coroner
turned
his
glance
toward
the
sick
girl
how
long
was
your
father
here
before
your
brother
arrived
i
am
not
sure
she
replied
in
her
low
voice
it
may
have
been
an
hour
perhaps
it
was
more
the
nurse
and
the
maid
had
evidently
not
been
far
away
for
the
policeman
now
led
them
into
the
room
the
maid
was
an
exceedingly
black
negro
girl
and
obviously
frightened
the
nurse
wore
her
trim
uniform
well
her
face
was
calm
and
her
eyes
were
level
and
serene
apparently
long
training
in
the
hospitals
had
not
been
wasted
in
her
case
what
your
name
inquired
shower
of
the
maid
rosamond
wyat
suh
replied
the
girl
and
then
eagerly
but
deedy
boss
i
do
know
nothing
about
this
killing
i
was
back
in
that
yeah
kitchen
and
answer
my
questions

said
the
assistant
coroner
severely
you
were
present
in
the
house
last
night
yes
suh
i
done
lef
dat
man
in
but
that
all
i
know
had
you
ever
seen

that
i
declah
i
never

and
i
was
mighty
when
he
tole
me
he
was
miss
fathah
i
never
knowed
she
had
a
fathah
did
you
hear
nothing
later
no
loud
talking
the
noise
or
shock
of
a
fall
no
suh
the
inquisitor
now
turned
to
the
nurse
now
miss
wheeler
she
said
quietly
susan
wheeler
tell
us
what
know
of
this
matter
if
you
please
miss
wheeler
miss
burton
had
been
feeling
rather
better
all
day
yesterday
said
the
nurse
and
as
the
evening
went
on
she
said
i
could
go
to
bed
as
she
meant
to
wait
up
for
her
brother
and
did
you
do
so
no
sir
replied
the
nurse
miss
burton
once
or
twice
before
had
overestimated
her
strength
and
ever
since
then
i
have
been
careful
never
to
be
too
far
away
instead
of
going
to
bed
i
came
into
this
room
got
a
book
and
began
to
read
osborne
coughed
behind
his
hand
the
eyes
of
the
assistant
coroner
snapped
with
appreciation
but
bat
scanlon
gave
his
attention
to
young
burton
and
his
sister
the
girl
had
sat
up
with
sudden
strength
and
was
regarding
the
quiet
young
nurse
with
dilated
eyes
the
face
of
the
brother
had
gone
gray
he
held
to
the
heavy
frame
of
his
sister
chair
and
the
big
trainer
noted
that
he
swayed
slightly
and
were
you
in
this
room
when
the
man
now
dead
was
shown
into
the
one
across
the
hall
i
was
replied
the
nurse
with
the
calm
impersonal
manner
of
her
kind
i
heard
the
ring
and
heard
what
he
said
to
the
maid
and
like
her
i
was
surprised
to
hear
that
it
was
miss
burton
father
however
i
paid
little
attention
but
went
on
with
my
reading
did
you
hear
any
of
the
conversation
i
heard
voices
or
to
be
more
correct
i
heard
a
voice
the
father
did
all
the
talking
as
far
as
i
could
hear
but
as
i
have
said
i
was
interested
in
my
book
you
do
recall
any
scraps
of
talk
a
detached
phrase
anything
the
nurse
shook
her
head
the
only
clear
impression
i
have
is
of
the
man
laugh
there
was
something
irritating
about
it
and
i
wished
he
stop
when
the
younger
burton
came
home
what
then
the
voices
rose
suddenly
but
the
two
doors
were
closed
and
i
could
only
catch
a
word
here
and
there
but
i
did
hear
young
burton
call
his
father
a
rascal
and
order
him
to
leave
the
house
just
about
then
i
thought
of
the
maid
and
went
back
to
the
kitchen
to
tell
her
she
might
go
to
bed
but
she
had
already
gone
there
were
a
few
things
i
had
to
do
in
the
kitchen
and
i
remained
there
until
i
had
finished
them
then
i
came
back
here
well
they
were
still
talking
in
the
rather
loudly
i
thought
did
you
hear
any
sound
like
a
struggle
the
maid
stood
with
her
rather
thin
lips
pressed
tightly
together
for
a
moment
then
she
said
reluctantly
yes
anything
more
shower
fingers
were
now
twisted
in
the
trimmed
beard
eagerly
miss
burton
cried
out
then
there
was
a
sudden
jar
that
made
everything
shake
like
some
one
falling
yes
replied
the
nurse
with
lowered
head
ah
this
was
a
low
exclamation
and
came
from
osborne
and
it
was
followed
by
a
deep
silence
during
which
the
rapid
ticking
of
a
small
clock
upon
a
writing
table
seemed
to
suddenly
swell
into
an
overwhelming
volume
of
sound
it
was
the
sick
girl
who
spoke
first
she
threw
out
her
frail
white
hands
in
a
gesture
of
protection
toward
her
brother
frank
she
cried
do
you
hear
the
young
man
ashen
of
face
and
with
eyes
wide
open
had
been
staring
at
the
nurse
but
at
the
sound
of
his
sister
voice
he
roused
himself
and
said
hurriedly
all
right
mary
all
right
my
dear
then
to
the
assistant
coroner
he
added
very
likely
what
miss
wheeler
says
is
true
there
was
a
struggle
though
not
much
of
a
one
and
perhaps
my
sister
was
frightened
and
did
cry
out
but
what
of
the
sudden
jar
though
some
one
had
fallen
asked
osborne
it
must
have
been
when
my
father
struck
the
wall
as
i
pushed
him
aside
said
the
young
man
as
he
passed
one
hand
across
his
face
that
is
the
only
way
i
can
account
for
it
what
more
was
there
miss
wheeler
a
few
moments
later
burton
took
his
sister
to
her
room
i
expected
to
be
called
but
was
not
in
a
little
while
burton
came
down
once
more
and
i
heard
him
go
into
the
there
was
a
pause
after
this
then
he
called
my
name
i
went
out
at
once
he
was
standing
in
the
hall
with
the
door
partly
closed
and
his
hand
upon
the
knob
it
was
then
he
told
me
what
had
happened
that
some
one
had
struck
down
his
father
and
that
he
was
afraid
he
was
dead
and
that
i
must
call
in
the
police
you
did
not
see
the
body
yes
sir
as
i
said
the
door
was
partly
open
i
saw
the
body
plainly
the
assistant
coroner
asked
a
number
of
other
questions
but
nothing
of
value
was
brought
out
very
well
said
the
questioner
finally
to
the
two
women
that
will
be
all
for
the
time
being
thank
you
and
then
as
they
left
the
room
he
added
to
osborne
and
now
let
us
have
a
look
in
the
next
room
the
two
went
out
into
the
hall
promptly
scanlon
followed
the
door
was
exactly
opposite
and
they
entered
silently
through
the
shutters
a
dim
light
was
admitted
and
fell
across
the
floor
almost
in
the
center
of
this
a
huddled
form
lay
in
a
twisted
sidelong
fashion
the
head
rested
upon
a
rug
one
end
of
which
was
thick
and
hard
with
blood
a
white
cloth
covered
the
dead
man
face
just
as
he
dropped
when
hit
said
the
police
sergeant
who
was
in
the
room
nobody
has
stirred
him
an
inch
osborne
practiced
eye
went
about
the
apartment
is
everything
else
as
it
was
he
asked
not
a
thing
touched
the
sergeant
assured
him
i
got
here
an
hour
after
it
happened
and
i
made
it
a
point
to
see
that
there
was
no
tramping
in
and
out
the
room
been
under
guard
ever
since
osborne
nodded
his
approval
of
this
and
then
turned
toward
the
assistant
coroner
who
had
knelt
beside
the
body
and
was
now
lifting
the
cloth
what
it
look
like
he
asked
bending
over
a
frightful
blow
said
shower
and
it
was
a
strong
arm
that
struck
it
then
with
suddenly
increased
interest
he
peered
still
closer
at
the
terrible
wound
in
the
side
of
the
head
hello
said
he
this
is
rather
unusual
in
shape
he
looked
up
at
the
sergeant
who
was
passing
his
hand
behind
a
row
of
books
upon
a
shelf
what
sort
of
a
weapon
was
used
he
asked
the
police
sergeant
turned
a
look
at
the
questioner
over
his
shoulder
we
have
been
able
to
find
any
said
he
and
we
looked
everywhere
i
been
over
this
room
a
dozen
times
myself
and
i
going
over
it
again
it
was
done
with
the
kind
of
a
thing
a
man
would
carry
in
his
pockets
i
sure
of
that
right
said
osborne
who
had
also
closely
examined
the
wound
by
this
time
the
cut
too
wide
for
a
blackjack
or
what
the
english
call
a
and
it
too
deep
it
was
made
with
something
with
a
sharp
edge
something
wide
and
heavy
are
you
quite
sure
of
that
the
voice
was
that
of
frank
burton
and
looking
in
the
direction
of
the
door
they
saw
that
the
young
man
had
entered
the
room
is
it
not
possible
that
the
wound
was
caused
by
a
regulation
weapon
of
some
sort
after
all
is
the
shape
of
the
cut
an
infallible
test
as
to
the
character
of
the
instrument
used
there
was
an
anxious
eagerness
in
the
voice
the
gray
pallor
of
the
face
and
the
feverish
eyes
were
those
of
a
man
whose
nerves
were
clamoring
but
whose
roused
mind
refused
to
give
them
rest
such
is
the
case
in
the
great
majority
of
instances
said
shower
firmly
we
are
seldom
led
astray
there
has
been
no
weapon
found
persisted
young
burton
and
that
being
the
case
do
you
not
think
it
possible
but
here
a
sudden
exclamation
from
osborne
who
had
gone
to
one
of
the
windows
and
stood
looking
out
interrupted
the
speaker
in
spite
of
his
bigness
the
detective
was
in
excellent
training
with
a
spring
he
went
through
the
window
which
opened
upon
a
walk
fringed
with
bushes
and
in
another
moment
he
was
back
in
the
room
do
be
too
sure
about
no
weapon
being
found
said
he
triumph
in
his
face
and
voice
what
would
you
call
this
as
he
spoke
he
held
up
a
heavy
brass
candlestick
it
had
a
solid
base
of
metal
and
the
edge
of
this
was
darkly
clotted
with
blood
chapter
iv
makes
one
visit
and
plans
another
sat
upon
a
sofa
the
amber
bit
of
his
coblentz
pipe
between
his
teeth
and
the
wreaths
of
smoke
curling
above
his
head
about
him
were
scattered
bound
volumes
of
police
papers
and
upon
his
knees
rested
a
huge
book
canvas
covered
and
seeming
full
of
carefully
spaced
entries
done
in
a
copper
plate
hand
i
knew
the
had
gone
along
without
much
friction
with
the
police
said
the
investigator
but
i
admit
that
i
a
bit
surprised
at
the
completeness
of
the
thing
a
dapper
young
man
who
stood
at
a
filing
case
going
over
a
thick
inset
of
cards
laughed
a
little
i
venture
to
say
that
there
is
not
a
police
blotter
in
any
large
city
in
the
country
that
holds
the
name
of
tom
burton
said
he
but
there
are
dozens
of
other
names
poor
devils
rounded
up
in
some
risky
operation
of
which
the
was
the
instigator
nodded
one
might
call
that
it
said
he
or
it
might
be
viewed
as
exceedingly
clever
work
it
altogether
depends
upon
the
point
of
view
to
maintain
such
an
attitude
in
the
background
over
a
long
period
of
time
calls
for
a
rigorous
burton
was
evidently
a
criminal
of
some
parts
well
looking
at
it
from
that
side
i
suppose
it
so
said
the
dapper
young
man
but
i
been
accustomed
to
seeing
burton
and
his
kind
as
a
sort
of
dregs
and
i
was
just
a
little
surprised
when
you
began
to
look
him
up
smiled
and
drew
a
long
draft
of
smoke
from
the
big
pipe
it
is
very
likely
time
wasted
he
said
for
it
a
hundred
to
one
that
nothing
here
there
came
a
long
from
the
lower
part
of
the
house
and
the
investigator
stopped
short
i
rather
think
added
he
that
i
reduce
the
odds
for
unless
i
am
much
mistaken
that
is
bat
scanlon
touch
at
the
a
few
moments
later
stumph
man
servant
entered
the
study
gravely
scanlon
sir
he
said
the
big
form
of
scanlon
filled
the
doorway
and
then
advanced
into
the
room
did
expect
to
see
you
again
said
he
but
there
a
little
matter
came
up
that
i
thought
i
get
your
advice
on
before
i
went
any
further
good
said
the
investigator
briskly
then
to
the
servant
stumph
get
these
books
away
and
fuller
to
the
dapper
young
man
i
like
to
have
transcripts
of
those
treasury
department
papers
at
once
very
well
said
fuller
when
the
investigator
and
his
caller
were
alone
the
former
offered
the
other
some
cigarettes
these
are
porto
ricos
of
unusual
flavor
he
said
sent
me
by
a
planter
for
whom
i
chanced
at
one
time
to
do
a
small
service
he
put
aside
the
coblentz
and
with
scanlon
lighted
one
of
the
cigarettes
the
full
rich
aroma
of
the
island
herb
drifted
through
the
room
like
a
heavy
incense
and
under
its
influence
the
troubled
look
which
scanlon
face
had
worn
lightened
a
trifle
i
guess
i
a
little
up
in
the
air
admitted
he
finally
it
always
that
way
with
me
when
things
begin
to
break
wrong
in
anything
interested
in
just
when
i
need
all
my
nerve
and
judgment
i
get
as
anxious
as
an
old
lady
who
been
sold
the
wrong
kind
of
tea
you
have
no
monopoly
on
the
condition
smiled
it
comes
to
all
of
us
and
in
just
the
way
you
described
his
singular
eyes
were
studying
the
big
man
face
and
in
their
depths
was
a
sort
of
calm
expectancy
the
personal
equation
has
many
queer
results
but
what
is
the
cause
of
your
present
upheaval
bat
shook
the
ash
from
the
cigarette
into
a
pewter
bowl
at
his
elbow
it
this
murder
he
said
you
know
i
went
to
stanwick
to
look
things
over
as
per
request
have
you
made
your
report
to
mrs
burton
now
look
exclaimed
the
big
man
do
call
her
that
she
was
burton
wife
for
one
week
and
that
the
extent
of
her
use
of
the
name
very
well
nodded
cavanaugh
is
a
good
old
name
and
is
sounded
just
as
easily
yes
i
called
on
her
after
i
got
back
said
bat
but
i
had
only
a
few
minutes
to
talk
to
her
it
was
at
the
theatre
for
she
had
a
rehearsal
you
see
was
there
anything
new
to
tell
her
here
bat
related
to
the
investigator
the
details
of
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
at
the
burton
home
listened
attentively
now
and
then
a
pointed
question
came
through
the
little
clouds
and
rings
of
smoke
with
which
he
had
surrounded
himself
but
save
for
this
he
made
no
interruption
until
bat
had
finished
shower
eh
said
he
after
a
little
pause
i
rather
well
acquainted
with
his
method
and
the
fact
that
he
been
given
charge
of
the
coroner
examination
is
a
very
hopeful
sign
he
a
sort
of
pedant
who
has
come
to
think
that
the
mixture
of
medical
learning
and
knowledge
of
police
conventions
which
he
possesses
makes
him
a
paragon
of
efficiency
i
noticed
that
he
had
a
confident
kind
of
a
way
with
him
said
bat
confidence
is
an
excellent
thing
spoke
a
man
does
not
go
far
without
it
but
the
sort
kept
in
stock
by
shower
is
rather
a
hindrance
when
he
has
once
arrived
at
a
conclusion
he
shuts
his
eyes
and
stops
his
ears
to
everything
else
osborne
now
is
different
while
he
a
plodding
kind
of
a
fellow
with
very
little
imagination
shrewd
enough
to
accept
advantages
wherever
he
finds
them
the
speaker
added
another
cloud
to
those
already
hovering
about
him
miss
cavanaugh
was
satisfied
with
what
you
told
her
i
suppose
but
bat
shook
his
head
and
a
good
part
of
the
old
troubled
look
returned
she
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
could
see
that
it
worried
her
when
i
left
her
she
was
fidgeting
and
if
nora
does
that
something
wrong
but
the
worst
did
happen
until
about
a
half
hour
ago
i
was
back
at
my
place
and
the
bell
rang
when
i
went
to
it
i
found
it
was
nora
calling
and
she
was
all
excited
once
more
ah
said
expectantly
excited
she
started
off
by
asking
me
to
forgive
her
and
saying
she
must
be
a
great
bother
to
me
but
something
had
happened
something
that
had
scared
her
as
she
came
home
from
the
theatre
she
heard
the
newsboys
calling
their
papers
on
the
street
corners
she
could
quite
make
out
what
they
were
saying
so
she
had
the
car
stop
and
her
driver
get
one
of
the
papers
then
she
got
the
facts
of
the
matter
young
frank
burton
has
been
arrested
for
his
father
murder
so
said
i
expected
to
hear
that
had
happened
for
from
what
you
told
me
the
police
have
a
fair
tissue
of
evidence
that
about
what
i
told
nora
but
it
bowled
her
over
completely
her
voice
began
to
shake
and
i
knew
she
was
crying
he
did
do
it
she
says
did
do
it
he
innocent
i
know
he
is
i
tried
to
reason
with
her
proceeded
bat
but
she
would
listen
she
kept
repeating
that
he
was
innocent
that
he
had
suffered
enough
at
that
man
hands
while
he
was
alive
and
that
he
must
go
on
suffering
now
that
the
father
was
dead
well
asked
as
the
other
paused
what
then
then
said
scanlon
she
was
on
my
neck
to
get
him
out
of
the
thing
i
do
it
i
not
let
them
harm
him
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
she
seems
to
think
that
i
got
a
heavy
drag
with
the
police
and
all
there
is
for
me
to
do
is
to
snap
my
fingers
and
they
sit
up
and
perform
i
tried
to
persuade
her
that
this
was
a
dream
but
i
could
convince
her
and
the
result
was
that
i
had
to
promise
to
see
her
right
away
bat
looked
dolefully
at
his
friend
i
on
my
way
there
now
he
said
and
i
thought
i
stop
in
and
ask
what
i
better
do
arose
and
took
a
turn
up
and
down
the
room
then
throwing
away
the
cigarette
end
he
paused
in
front
of
his
friend
and
asked
what
would
you
say
if
i
suggested
that
i
go
with
you
fine
scanlon
jumped
up
an
expression
of
relief
upon
his
face
the
very
thing
get
your
hat
my
cab
is
still
at
the
door
i
could
have
asked
for
anything
better
than
that
within
five
minutes
the
two
were
on
the
street
a
street
lined
with
fine
wide
houses
of
a
bygone
time
but
which
was
now
a
bedlam
of
throaty
voices
a
whirling
current
of
alien
people
a
miasma
of
stale
smells
the
taxi
soon
whirled
them
out
of
this
section
and
into
another
equally
old
but
still
clinging
to
its
ancient
state
the
houses
were
square
fronted
and
solid
looking
built
of
brick
and
trimmed
with
white
stone
there
were
marble
carriage
blocks
and
at
the
curb
i
wonder
how
long
before
this
will
begin
to
go
said
the
investigator
as
they
alighted
there
is
scarcely
an
old
residential
street
left
unmarred
in
the
big
cities
of
the
east
that
is
nora
house
there
with
the
scaffolding
at
the
side
take
care
you
do
step
in
that
mortar
these
fellows
seem
to
slap
their
stuff
around
and
do
give
a
hang
i
had
no
idea
miss
cavanaugh
lived
in
this
section
said
after
scanlon
had
rung
the
bell
and
they
stood
waiting
on
the
steps
why
you
see
she
different
naturally
she
a
housekeeper
the
big
hotel
or
the
glittering
apartment
house
does
appeal
to
her
she
gets
all
that
when
she
on
the
road
a
trim
maid
admitted
them
and
showed
them
into
a
room
hung
with
beautiful
tapestry
and
excellently
selected
paintings
in
a
few
moments
there
came
a
light
hasty
step
and
nora
stood
framed
in
the
doorway
she
wore
a
sort
of
soft
gauzy
thing
which
clung
to
her
magnificently
strong
yet
completely
youthful
figure
causing
her
more
than
ever
to
resemble
a
young
juno
the
gleaming
bronze
hair
was
gathered
in
a
great
coil
at
the
back
of
her
head
her
wonderfully
modeled
arms
were
bare
the
right
was
clasped
about
with
a
heavy
bracelet
of
what
seemed
raw
red
gold
bat
she
said
gladly
and
then
stopped
short
at
sight
of
a
stranger
this
is
said
scanlon
presenting
his
companion
you
heard
me
speak
of
him
i
think
nora
cavanaugh
held
out
her
hand
with
that
frankness
which
is
always
so
fascinating
in
a
beautiful
woman
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
she
said
and
i
recall
very
well
what
i
heard
of
you
it
was
that
queer
affair
of
the
campes
and
the
strange
dangers
which
haunted
the
hills
about
their
country
place
her
eyes
were
fixed
steadily
upon
as
she
spoke
the
smile
of
welcome
was
still
in
them
but
behind
this
there
was
something
else
a
something
which
evidently
interested
intensely
i
been
telling
kirk
of
the
thing
at
stanwick
spoke
scanlon
as
they
all
three
sat
down
at
a
west
window
through
which
the
lowering
sun
was
throwing
its
crimsoning
touch
he
a
little
interested
and
thought
he
like
to
hear
what
you
had
to
say
the
smile
went
completely
out
of
nora
eyes
the
sombre
thing
at
the
back
of
them
came
at
once
to
the
surface
and
saw
her
hand
as
she
lifted
it
to
her
face
tremble
the
police
are
fools
she
declared
frank
burton
is
innocent
it
is
shameful
to
attribute
any
crime
to
him
but
to
accuse
him
of
the
murder
of
his
father
here
a
shudder
ran
through
her
it
horrible
he
have
to
carefully
explain
a
number
of
things
though
before
the
authorities
change
their
minds
said
scanlon
not
only
have
they
certain
definite
facts
on
him
but
they
have
the
notion
that
he
not
told
them
everything
he
is
innocent
protested
nora
maybe
so
bat
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
i
had
a
chance
to
look
him
over
and
while
i
liked
his
appearance
i
agree
with
the
cops
that
he
was
holding
back
on
them
the
girl
rose
and
stood
facing
them
it
may
be
that
he
is
she
said
and
there
was
a
break
in
the
rare
voice
but
why
fix
upon
this
so
readily
as
a
sign
of
guilt
consider
the
circumstances
he
is
the
son
of
a
man
whose
life
was
a
continuous
shame
there
very
likely
was
not
a
day
that
did
not
bring
some
fresh
knowledge
of
to
the
boy
some
mean
thing
beneath
contempt
which
made
him
shrink
and
quiver
and
now
there
comes
another
thing
a
last
and
horrible
one
it
may
be
and
the
beautiful
arms
lifted
in
a
gesture
of
despair
that
in
this
there
was
additional
shame
can
you
wonder
then
that
he
hesitated
bat
scanlon
did
not
reply
contenting
himself
with
merely
nodding
his
head
this
side
of
the
thing
had
not
occurred
to
him
but
now
that
she
had
pointed
it
out
it
seemed
quite
reasonable
fixed
his
singular
dark
eyes
upon
the
beautiful
woman
who
stood
so
appealingly
before
them
scanlon
mentioned
to
me
a
while
ago
spoke
the
investigator
that
you
were
interested
in
doing
what
you
could
to
help
this
young
man
i
make
it
a
point
never
to
judge
the
merits
of
a
case
until
i
have
examined
it
at
close
range
however
i
will
say
this
from
a
distance
this
matter
begins
to
show
promise
so
much
indeed
that
i
feel
i
must
know
more
about
it
she
looked
at
him
her
hands
twining
together
nervously
but
she
did
not
speak
and
he
went
on
what
you
say
about
the
police
is
largely
true
they
superficial
and
the
arrest
of
young
burton
may
not
be
at
all
warranted
by
the
facts
as
it
happens
miss
cavanaugh
easily
there
are
no
very
pressing
matters
to
engage
me
just
now
and
since
you
are
so
interested
suppose
i
look
into
it
and
see
if
i
can
gather
up
any
stray
threads
missed
by
the
police
bat
scanlon
brought
his
palms
together
in
great
satisfaction
but
to
his
astonishment
when
he
looked
at
nora
he
saw
hesitancy
plainly
written
in
her
beautiful
face
indeed
there
was
more
than
hesitancy
refusal
of
the
offer
trembled
upon
her
lips
but
this
was
only
for
an
instant
a
sudden
rush
of
excitement
seemed
to
possess
her
and
she
held
out
her
hand
to
warmly
this
is
good
of
you
she
said
and
i
thank
you
a
thousand
times
if
you
can
in
any
way
make
it
clear
to
frank
burton
friends
to
every
one
that
he
is
not
guilty
you
do
the
best
deed
of
your
life
and
here
the
great
brown
eyes
opened
widely
you
will
be
helping
me
more
than
i
can
say
very
well
said
the
investigator
going
to
a
window
he
stood
with
his
back
to
them
looking
at
the
sky
now
blotched
red
and
gold
in
the
waning
rays
of
the
sun
he
was
motionless
for
a
moment
or
two
and
then
he
turned
briskly
it
a
pity
there
are
not
a
few
hours
more
of
daylight
said
he
for
my
experience
has
shown
me
that
most
cases
in
which
there
is
any
doubt
do
not
stand
delay
a
few
hours
sometimes
dims
what
otherwise
would
be
hopeful
clues
traces
which
had
they
been
taken
up
in
time
might
have
led
directly
to
the
criminal
are
rendered
cold
and
useless
could
something
be
done
out
at
stanwick
asked
bat
anxiously
but
the
criminologist
shook
his
head
it
would
be
impossible
said
he
night
always
puts
any
sort
of
intelligent
examination
out
of
the
question
but
and
he
looked
at
nora
with
an
alertness
of
manner
which
showed
how
his
keen
mind
was
already
taking
hold
the
time
between
now
and
daylight
need
not
be
altogether
lost
what
can
we
do
she
asked
eagerly
sometimes
even
the
smallest
scrap
of
information
is
of
great
value
said
he
the
movements
the
conversation
of
a
suspect
or
a
victim
immediately
before
the
crime
has
more
than
once
provided
the
thing
necessary
to
a
successful
solution
why
yes
that
would
be
true
of
course
but
the
eagerness
had
gone
out
of
her
manner
suddenly
her
hands
seemed
to
flutter
at
her
breast
small
seemingly
unimportant
things
even
in
my
work
add
greatly
to
a
result
the
keen
eyes
of
never
left
her
face
about
what
time
was
it
last
night
that
your
husband
came
here
he
asked
it
must
have
been
between
and
twelve
she
replied
slowly
i
had
just
got
home
from
the
theatre
he
demanded
money
i
believe
yes
that
was
always
the
cause
of
his
visits
will
you
tell
me
as
nearly
as
you
can
remember
what
passed
when
i
came
in
said
nora
i
went
directly
to
my
own
rooms
my
maid
followed
me
a
few
moments
later
but
just
then
there
was
a
ring
at
the
bell
the
lateness
of
the
hour
gave
me
a
feeling
of
uneasiness
it
were
as
though
i
subconsciously
realized
who
was
at
the
door
when
the
maid
answered
the
ring
he
pushed
her
aside
and
i
heard
his
feet
running
up
the
stairs
the
impulse
arose
in
me
to
lock
my
door
at
any
other
time
i
think
i
would
have
done
so
but
just
then
i
felt
aroused
i
was
bitterly
angry
that
he
should
force
himself
upon
me
in
such
a
way
made
me
desire
to
face
him
to
tell
him
what
i
thought
in
very
plain
words
this
was
not
your
usual
state
of
mind
when
he
visited
you
no
she
bent
her
proud
head
humbly
when
i
first
learned
his
true
character
i
left
him
in
just
that
spirit
but
when
i
had
won
my
way
by
hard
work
and
he
began
persecuting
me
i
thought
it
better
to
give
him
the
money
he
asked
and
avoid
his
poisonous
falsehoods
you
were
afraid
of
him
not
of
him
but
of
my
public
of
the
world
in
general
he
threatened
me
with
the
divorce
court
divorce
with
its
humiliations
its
confessions
of
failure
its
publicity
had
always
appalled
me
the
sneer
actress
being
divorced
made
me
a
coward
he
knew
that
he
had
found
it
out
somehow
his
great
talent
was
in
bringing
weaknesses
to
the
surface
he
detailed
the
charges
he
would
bring
against
me
every
one
of
them
was
a
lie
but
they
were
so
ingenious
so
plausible
so
unutterably
slimy
that
i
could
bear
up
against
them
it
was
in
that
way
he
broke
my
spirit
there
was
a
hound
for
you
said
bat
scanlon
that
is
if
i
not
injuring
the
hound
family
by
the
comparison
but
last
night
said
nora
cavanaugh
i
had
lost
all
this
fear
of
him
and
his
threats
i
do
know
why
it
was
really
because
he
had
forced
his
way
into
my
room
for
he
had
done
that
before
it
must
have
been
that
this
was
a
sort
of
culmination
the
breaking
point
at
any
rate
i
refused
his
demands
i
answered
his
sneers
in
a
way
which
i
saw
took
him
aback
he
resumed
his
old
threat
of
the
divorce
court
but
i
defied
him
then
after
about
half
an
hour
he
went
away
that
was
all
yes
the
girl
stood
in
such
a
position
that
the
waning
daylight
fell
full
upon
her
beautiful
face
said
quietly
thank
you
then
as
she
was
about
to
turn
toward
scanlon
he
added
pardon
me
you
have
had
a
little
accident
i
notice
her
hand
went
to
her
brow
and
her
eyes
startled
and
big
looked
at
him
swiftly
i
had
noticed
it
he
went
on
quietly
until
you
pushed
your
hair
back
a
moment
ago
it
must
have
been
very
painful
oh
yes
yes
she
hurriedly
drew
down
some
strands
of
the
heavy
bronze
hair
over
an
ugly
dark
bruise
near
the
temple
i
had
forgotten
yes
it
was
very
painful
indeed
when
it
happened
you
see
and
she
laughed
in
a
breathless
nervous
sort
of
way
my
maid
left
the
door
of
a
dressing
cabinet
open
in
my
room
at
the
theatre
and
as
i
bent
over
i
struck
against
it
he
murmured
something
sympathetically
and
then
looked
at
scanlon
who
obediently
arose
in
the
morning
said
we
take
the
first
train
for
stanwick
and
by
this
time
evening
we
may
have
some
news
of
importance
for
you
i
hope
so
she
answered
i
sincerely
hope
so
the
maid
entered
in
reply
to
a
ring
and
brought
their
hats
and
coats
it
may
be
that
you
or
your
people
here
in
the
house
can
be
of
help
to
us
said
evenly
i
should
like
to
feel
that
i
can
count
on
that
at
any
time
to
be
sure
nora
turned
to
the
maid
anna
is
doing
me
a
great
service
anything
he
asks
must
be
done
yes
miss
cavanaugh
said
the
maid
then
the
two
men
bid
the
charming
actress
when
they
had
climbed
into
the
cab
and
rolled
away
the
investigator
lay
back
against
the
hard
leather
padding
and
closed
his
eyes
scanlon
looked
at
the
keen
outline
of
the
face
with
interest
it
was
an
altogether
modern
countenance
in
perfect
tune
with
the
time
but
for
all
that
there
was
something
almost
mystic
in
it
it
may
have
been
that
the
mind
which
weighed
and
valued
so
many
things
unnoticed
by
the
crowd
had
given
something
of
the
same
touch
to
the
face
as
the
pondering
of
the
secrets
of
life
is
said
to
give
to
the
oriental
anchorites
but
after
a
little
the
investigator
sat
upright
when
does
miss
cavanaugh
have
a
matinée
he
asked
not
until
saturday
replied
scanlon
a
look
of
annoyance
came
into
the
face
of
too
bad
said
he
then
we
shall
have
to
arrange
something
he
reflected
for
a
moment
snapping
his
fingers
impatiently
as
though
for
an
idea
then
his
countenance
suddenly
lighted
up
i
have
it
young
burton
is
in
the
county
prison
awaiting
action
of
the
grand
jury
what
more
natural
thing
than
that
she
should
visit
him
there
to
offer
sympathy
and
encouragement
say
between
two
and
five
afternoon
you
mean
and
bat
looked
at
him
only
dimly
grasping
what
was
behind
the
words
that
i
depend
upon
you
to
suggest
this
to
her
said
the
other
the
sort
of
thing
she
do
once
it
in
her
mind
but
asked
the
astonished
big
man
what
it
for
i
want
to
pay
another
visit
to
her
house
said
coolly
when
she
is
not
there
chapter
v
the
hound
and
the
scent
the
next
morning
at
a
trifle
past
nine
bat
scanlon
once
more
presented
himself
in
study
he
found
the
investigator
attired
in
a
suit
of
rough
gray
material
a
light
stick
and
a
cap
lay
upon
a
table
while
their
owner
his
hands
deep
in
his
trousers
pockets
paced
the
floor
i
been
through
a
half
dozen
newspapers
since
breakfast
said
he
the
reporters
and
the
city
editors
have
had
a
great
deal
to
say
about
what
they
call
the
mystery
but
they
have
unearthed
nothing
that
at
all
suggestive
not
a
thing
verified
bat
at
least
nothing
that
i
have
seen
or
heard
myself
except
that
the
sick
girl
mary
burton
has
taken
to
her
bed
that
bad
said
his
friend
but
you
see
the
arrest
of
her
brother
was
sure
to
have
some
such
effect
well
it
turned
a
little
trick
for
me
anyway
said
bat
the
girl
being
suddenly
taken
down
has
got
to
nora
and
she
called
me
this
morning
to
talk
about
it
she
going
down
there
this
afternoon
it
was
her
own
idea
and
so
i
wo
have
to
do
any
cover
stuff
with
her
good
said
the
investigator
it
always
much
better
to
have
a
thing
come
about
naturally
if
possible
a
big
motor
car
waited
for
them
at
the
door
it
carried
them
swiftly
out
of
the
city
proper
into
the
suburb
of
stanwick
and
finally
drew
up
in
front
of
duncan
street
the
same
policeman
stood
at
the
gate
who
had
guarded
it
the
day
before
hello
back
again
he
saluted
at
sight
of
scanlon
yes
thought
another
look
would
do
no
harm
returned
bat
any
one
inside
osborne
there
replied
the
policeman
but
no
one
else
outside
the
family
were
you
present
when
young
burton
was
arrested
asked
a
little
grinned
the
policeman
seeing
as
i
was
the
party
who
brought
him
out
to
the
wagon
did
he
have
anything
to
say
when
accused
not
much
he
did
seem
surprised
though
osborne
says
to
him
have
to
hold
you
in
this
case
till
we
get
further
evidence
and
he
says
did
do
it
if
i
had
thought
of
it
maybe
i
would
but
i
did
do
it
the
investigator
and
bat
scanlon
walked
up
the
path
as
they
reached
the
door
it
was
opened
for
them
and
they
saw
the
burly
form
of
osborne
standing
in
the
hall
how
are
you
greeted
the
headquarters
man
saw
you
from
the
window
and
felt
so
honored
that
i
letting
you
in
myself
he
shook
by
the
hand
warmly
enough
kind
of
a
surprise
to
see
you
down
here
the
two
men
entered
and
the
door
closed
behind
them
then
they
made
their
way
into
the
following
osborne
the
body
of
the
murdered
man
was
no
longer
there
the
rug
stiffened
with
blood
was
gone
the
room
was
now
quiet
and
conventional
a
peaceful
calm
filled
it
keen
glance
went
about
he
talked
steadily
to
osborne
all
the
while
but
bat
scanlon
observed
that
not
a
single
detail
of
the
apartment
escaped
him
the
headquarters
man
wore
a
look
of
frank
curiosity
as
he
too
watched
the
investigator
and
saw
him
fixing
the
position
of
things
in
his
mind
just
where
did
the
body
lie
when
the
policeman
arrived
on
the
night
of
the
crime
he
asked
right
here
and
osborne
indicated
the
spot
the
head
was
here
the
wound
was
made
with
a
candlestick
quite
a
heavy
one
and
the
blow
was
meant
to
stop
the
victim
for
good
any
further
marks
on
him
besides
the
one
on
the
head
no
said
osborne
we
looked
for
something
of
that
kind
but
there
was
none
went
to
a
window
overlooking
the
stretch
of
green
sod
at
the
side
of
the
house
i
understand
you
found
the
candlestick
just
under
this
yes
the
window
was
a
little
open
and
i
guess
after
he
finished
the
job
the
murderer
wanted
to
get
rid
of
the
weapon
so
he
dropped
it
outside
nothing
to
be
had
here
said
after
a
few
moments
study
of
the
at
least
not
just
now
he
threw
up
the
window
and
stepped
out
followed
by
scanlon
standing
upon
the
paved
walk
the
investigator
looked
about
the
burton
house
like
the
others
on
duncan
street
sat
fairly
in
the
center
of
a
plot
of
ground
perhaps
two
hundred
feet
square
along
the
division
fence
between
that
and
the
next
house
was
a
stretch
of
smooth
sod
with
grass
still
green
at
one
place
upon
this
was
a
sort
of
rose
arbor
the
browned
hardy
shoots
of
a
perennial
twining
thickly
around
it
there
have
been
a
half
dozen
policemen
walking
about
here
said
pointing
to
the
soft
earth
under
the
window
and
that
is
fatal
to
any
sort
of
close
work
even
had
there
been
anything
in
the
first
place
however
in
spite
of
this
he
went
over
every
yard
of
the
space
about
the
house
at
the
rose
arbor
he
paused
directly
in
line
with
the
window
he
said
no
doubt
young
burton
placed
it
with
that
in
mind
the
invalid
sister
would
love
to
see
the
roses
in
early
summer
he
walked
behind
the
structure
and
then
bat
scanlon
saw
him
pause
suddenly
and
bend
over
rigid
with
eagerness
what
is
it
asked
the
big
man
for
answer
the
criminologist
pointed
to
the
ground
sharply
indented
in
the
sod
were
the
marks
of
a
small
high
heeled
shoe
and
scanlon
stood
staring
at
them
perplexed
what
do
they
signify
asked
he
there
are
likely
to
be
footprints
all
over
the
place
male
and
female
i
venture
to
say
that
half
the
residents
of
the
street
have
been
prowling
about
in
this
space
since
the
murder
was
done
that
is
a
possibility
always
to
be
guarded
against
said
quietly
but
there
has
been
a
policeman
on
guard
all
the
time
so
you
see
the
chances
are
greatly
reduced
he
studied
the
narrow
imprints
with
great
care
they
were
firmly
pressed
into
the
damp
sod
the
high
heels
making
a
decided
puncture
the
night
before
last
was
a
bright
one
he
added
finally
as
he
straightened
up
and
looked
at
scanlon
at
about
the
time
the
murder
was
committed
the
moon
hung
about
there
full
and
unobstructed
if
you
remember
now
suppose
you
for
some
secret
reason
entered
the
grounds
at
that
time
the
whole
space
on
this
side
was
flooded
with
light
and
yet
you
desired
to
get
a
view
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
at
the
same
time
you
were
most
anxious
not
to
be
seen
what
would
you
be
most
likely
to
do
scanlon
looked
around
and
considered
about
the
only
thing
to
do
in
a
case
like
that
said
he
would
be
to
take
cover
behind
this
rose
arbor
right
approved
the
investigator
and
now
consider
once
behind
it
the
only
place
from
which
you
could
fully
overlook
the
window
desired
would
be
here
indicating
a
certain
spot
the
vine
has
wood
too
heavily
at
all
the
other
points
to
permit
of
uninterrupted
vision
and
right
here
you
will
notice
these
footprints
are
the
most
often
repeated
they
are
also
deeper
showing
that
the
woman
whoever
she
was
stood
here
for
some
little
time
scanlon
was
impressed
but
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
dubious
look
in
his
eye
a
woman
stand
there
he
agreed
and
maybe
she
was
looking
in
at
the
window
but
what
do
you
draw
from
that
smiled
nothing
as
yet
we
just
note
the
fact
old
chap
and
pass
on
to
the
next
later
we
put
the
two
together
and
see
if
any
meaning
is
to
be
had
from
the
combination
he
was
silent
after
that
moving
here
and
there
over
the
ground
his
head
bent
and
his
attention
fixed
scanlon
chuckled
as
he
watched
him
and
marveled
at
the
similarity
between
the
movements
of
his
friend
and
those
of
a
thoroughbred
hound
and
almost
with
his
nose
to
the
ground
observed
bat
he
so
fixed
in
what
he
doing
that
the
european
war
could
move
into
the
next
county
and
he
never
know
it
once
more
the
investigator
came
to
a
stop
from
beneath
the
division
fence
where
the
grass
was
rather
long
he
picked
a
shining
object
which
at
once
brought
bat
scanlon
to
his
side
a
revolver
exclaimed
the
big
man
amazed
illustration
every
chamber
loaded
with
every
chamber
loaded
said
the
investigator
it
a
smith
and
wesson
it
of
a
small
calibre
commonly
called
a
revolver
funny
how
it
got
there
ai
it
said
bat
for
it
could
have
had
anything
to
do
with
the
killing
of
the
seeing
that
he
passed
out
through
being
bumped
with
a
candlestick
nevertheless
said
as
he
slipped
the
weapon
into
his
pocket
the
thing
being
here
and
at
this
time
is
rather
interesting
he
proceeded
with
his
inspection
of
the
ground
striking
off
toward
the
front
of
the
house
as
though
following
a
trail
bat
lost
sight
of
him
for
a
few
moments
then
as
he
too
reached
the
front
of
the
house
he
saw
the
other
standing
his
hands
in
his
pockets
a
puzzled
look
on
his
face
well
said
scanlon
what
now
suppose
we
have
a
look
at
the
other
side
of
the
building
replied
the
other
here
the
police
had
also
done
some
going
to
and
fro
the
broad
foot
of
osborne
was
distinctly
marked
everywhere
and
here
is
the
sergeant
said
pointing
the
policeman
shoe
is
not
to
be
mistaken
and
sergeant
nailor
always
wears
soles
that
have
been
pegged
under
one
of
the
windows
the
investigator
came
to
a
halt
it
was
a
window
smaller
than
any
of
the
others
and
much
higher
in
the
wall
beneath
it
was
a
cellar
opening
with
an
iron
grating
look
there
said
the
investigator
as
he
pointed
to
this
latter
bat
scanlon
looked
and
saw
a
little
ridge
of
mud
upon
one
of
the
bars
from
some
one
foot
declared
he
it
scraped
off
on
the
grating
when
they
climbed
up
on
it
maybe
to
reach
the
window
studied
the
particles
clinging
to
the
bar
with
much
interest
an
eager
look
in
his
eyes
it
may
be
a
coincidence
said
he
but
i
inclined
to
think
not
what
may
be
a
coincidence
asked
scanlon
as
the
other
carefully
scraped
the
particles
from
the
grading
into
a
compartment
of
a
paper
fold
but
made
no
reply
except
give
me
a
up
to
that
window
the
big
man
obediently
did
so
on
the
ledge
were
the
marks
of
fingers
in
the
dust
which
damp
had
caused
to
stick
there
and
newly
done
said
as
he
dropped
to
the
ground
a
glint
in
his
eye
very
little
dust
has
attached
itself
since
they
were
made
he
began
searching
the
surface
of
the
ground
under
the
window
finally
he
took
a
strong
lens
from
his
pocket
and
with
increased
interest
resumed
the
inspection
very
likely
one
of
the
cops
did
this
said
scanlon
wanted
to
see
if
the
window
was
fast
got
up
from
his
stooping
position
and
slipped
the
lens
back
into
his
pocket
they
would
have
tried
the
window
from
the
inside
in
that
case
said
he
it
would
have
been
easier
to
get
at
he
stood
for
a
moment
reflecting
then
he
continued
there
seems
to
be
very
little
more
to
be
hoped
for
let
us
speak
to
osborne
before
we
go
the
big
headquarters
man
was
in
the
room
across
the
hall
from
the
one
in
which
the
crime
had
been
committed
well
all
through
he
asked
genially
and
with
the
manner
of
one
whose
position
is
assured
yes
i
think
so
said
we
covered
it
all
pretty
well
outside
there
nodded
osborne
complacently
and
we
got
nothing
from
it
depend
on
it
this
thing
was
an
inside
job
the
party
that
did
it
belonged
right
here
in
the
house
too
bad
mused
as
he
looked
about
the
comfortable
homelike
room
too
bad
that
will
mean
that
another
home
is
wrecked
and
this
one
seems
decidedly
worth
keeping
together
nice
etching
and
rugs
and
some
very
good
bits
of
old
brass
he
took
up
a
candlestick
from
the
end
of
a
shelf
here
is
a
real
old
colonial
candlestick
which
must
weigh
at
least
five
pounds
osborne
looked
at
the
piece
grimly
if
tom
burton
were
alive
said
he
he
might
be
able
to
tell
you
something
about
the
weight
of
such
things
it
was
with
just
such
another
he
was
killed
oh
indeed
replaced
the
candlestick
upon
the
shelf
and
dusted
his
fingers
with
a
handkerchief
well
we
be
running
along
osborne
they
shook
hands
with
the
detective
sorry
we
had
any
better
luck
so
am
i
said
osborne
still
complacently
but
it
breaks
that
way
sometimes
we
ca
turn
up
new
stuff
where
it
does
exist
true
said
as
he
descended
from
the
porch
to
the
paved
walk
that
very
true
but
thank
you
just
the
same
and
and
so
with
scanlon
at
his
side
he
set
off
at
a
smart
pace
toward
the
railroad
station
chapter
vi
asks
questions
dismissed
his
car
in
front
of
a
restaurant
in
the
center
of
the
city
he
and
his
friend
had
luncheon
in
a
quiet
corner
then
lighted
cigars
and
smoked
while
they
sipped
their
coffee
this
is
the
second
little
matter
i
had
to
put
up
to
you
said
bat
scanlon
i
hope
it
wo
grow
into
a
habit
if
it
has
any
of
the
entertaining
qualities
of
the
other
case
smiled
the
investigator
i
shall
be
greatly
beholden
to
you
bat
shook
his
head
and
watched
a
cloud
of
white
thin
smoke
vanish
in
the
air
that
hardly
seems
likely
said
he
stanwick
ai
the
place
for
mystery
that
warwick
furnace
was
and
on
the
face
of
it
anyway
duncan
street
ca
touch
castle
schwartzberg
for
thrills
beside
that
the
campe
affair
just
sizzled
with
stuff
while
this
one
like
as
not
is
finished
already
smiled
and
drew
slowly
at
his
cigar
this
latter
had
a
spicy
tang
a
flavor
which
suggested
hot
suns
and
heavy
dews
the
taste
was
rich
and
the
effect
heady
here
is
a
cigar
said
he
which
has
all
the
flavor
and
shock
of
a
richer
looking
and
more
suggestive
leaf
he
indicated
the
rather
negative
wrapper
and
went
on
as
you
see
it
has
any
of
that
lush
darkness
which
one
usually
associates
with
potent
tobacco
and
all
because
the
wrapper
was
grown
in
pennsylvania
for
a
casual
inspection
tells
nothing
of
the
tropical
growth
within
all
of
which
is
meant
to
mean
and
bat
scanlon
looked
at
his
friend
inquiringly
that
one
must
not
be
too
hasty
in
judging
a
thing
by
its
externals
the
campe
case
was
surrounded
by
a
sort
of
natural
melodrama
the
gloomy
hills
which
appear
to
have
impressed
miss
cavanaugh
the
huge
bulk
of
schwartzberg
castle
the
unaccountable
messages
and
unknown
agencies
all
led
one
to
expect
something
unusual
in
this
present
affair
however
the
stage
settings
are
not
nearly
so
sensational
and
yet
here
the
singular
eyes
of
the
investigator
were
fixed
upon
scanlon
intently
who
knows
results
may
not
be
lacking
why
do
you
mean
to
say
scanlon
began
the
question
in
a
voice
pitched
in
the
key
of
sudden
surprise
but
the
other
stopped
him
before
he
could
finish
as
i
said
a
while
ago
at
stanwick
remarked
it
is
not
yet
time
to
declare
anything
just
now
we
are
picking
up
what
facts
and
suggestions
we
can
later
we
try
fitting
them
together
he
drew
out
his
watch
and
looked
at
it
he
said
miss
cavanaugh
must
have
started
for
stanwick
before
this
so
suppose
we
go
now
for
our
call
scanlon
made
a
wry
face
as
he
arose
i
do
like
calling
spoke
he
and
i
especially
do
like
this
one
when
i
was
deputy
marshall
out
in
the
gunnison
country
i
once
made
a
call
at
the
house
of
a
gentleman
who
had
locked
himself
up
with
a
barrel
of
ammunition
and
a
half
dozen
winchesters
and
bid
defiance
to
the
law
it
was
no
soft
job
but
i
rather
do
it
again
than
this
i
think
you
are
a
little
in
the
matter
spoke
miss
cavanaugh
is
extremely
anxious
to
go
further
into
this
case
and
has
asked
our
help
as
i
see
it
we
can
greatly
increase
our
chances
of
success
by
this
visit
and
we
also
save
her
the
anxiety
of
seeing
us
prowling
around
it
was
about
a
half
hour
walk
to
nora
cavanaugh
house
and
when
they
rang
the
bell
the
same
trim
maid
opened
the
door
is
miss
cavanaugh
at
home
inquired
no
sir
replied
the
maid
she
went
out
about
a
half
hour
ago
i
sorry
said
the
investigator
a
look
of
vexation
upon
his
face
however
i
suppose
though
it
makes
no
difference
you
recall
what
miss
cavanaugh
said
to
you
when
we
were
here
yesterday
oh
yes
sir
very
well
excellent
said
and
now
we
like
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
if
you
please
the
girl
admitted
them
to
a
bright
old
reception
room
the
investigator
laid
his
hat
and
stick
upon
a
table
it
was
you
who
admitted
burton
the
last
time
he
was
here
was
it
not
i
opened
the
door
for
him
yes
sir
and
he
pushed
by
me
i
see
how
long
had
it
been
since
his
previous
visit
i
not
sure
but
some
time
what
sort
of
a
temper
was
he
in
he
was
always
disagreeable
sir
but
he
was
real
nasty
that
night
he
pushed
me
aside
as
if
i
was
nothing
at
all
the
black
eyes
of
the
maid
flashed
at
the
recollection
i
suppose
you
attend
miss
cavanaugh
at
the
theatre
as
well
as
at
home
oh
yes
she
has
no
other
maid
smiled
and
shook
his
finger
at
the
girl
then
it
was
you
who
left
the
door
of
a
cabinet
open
in
the
and
so
caused
that
little
accident
an
accident
the
girl
looked
at
him
surprisedly
i
do
think
i
know
just
what
you
mean
oh
well
never
mind
said
the
investigator
carelessly
a
little
mistake
of
mine
no
doubt
there
was
a
vague
sort
of
trouble
in
the
face
of
bat
scanlon
he
smoothed
his
chin
with
one
big
hand
and
shifted
his
weight
uneasily
from
one
foot
to
the
other
and
now
said
to
the
maid
when
burton
pushed
past
you
that
night
where
did
he
go
he
went
to
miss
cavanaugh
rooms
sir
and
just
did
he
go
take
us
to
the
rooms
just
as
he
went
the
girl
led
the
way
into
the
hall
once
more
when
he
passed
me
she
said
he
ran
up
those
stairs
pointing
at
first
i
did
know
what
to
do
but
i
followed
him
he
went
into
miss
cavanaugh
room
they
had
reached
the
second
floor
by
this
time
and
the
girl
pointed
to
a
door
without
ever
knocking
is
that
all
yes
sir
except
that
about
fifteen
minutes
later
he
left
the
house
very
well
and
now
if
we
may
we
like
to
see
the
inside
of
miss
cavanaugh
rooms
the
trim
little
maid
seemed
surprised
at
this
however
she
had
her
instructions
and
so
did
not
hesitate
she
opened
the
door
stood
aside
for
them
to
enter
and
then
followed
them
in
it
was
a
place
of
soft
colors
of
cool
aloofness
and
as
bat
scanlon
breathed
the
air
of
it
with
its
delicate
suggestion
of
scent
he
had
a
feeling
that
he
was
venturing
too
far
he
felt
that
his
act
was
almost
profanation
through
an
open
door
at
one
end
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
white
bed
but
it
was
only
a
glimpse
for
after
that
he
kept
his
head
turned
resolutely
in
another
direction
but
not
so
with
only
one
idea
held
his
mind
his
singular
eyes
studied
the
room
with
the
eagerness
of
an
ancient
scholar
poring
over
his
scrolls
miss
cavanaugh
wears
some
handsome
diamonds
in
the
play
in
which
she
is
now
appearing
said
he
suddenly
to
the
maid
oh
yes
sir
beautiful
and
real
ones
too
smiled
and
the
more
real
they
are
the
more
reason
why
she
should
permit
them
to
lie
about
like
that
said
he
pointing
to
a
stand
upon
which
rested
a
handsome
jewel
case
and
more
especially
when
i
see
a
scaffolding
just
outside
the
window
which
would
make
entrance
for
a
thief
rather
easy
it
perfectly
all
right
she
said
there
no
danger
sir
she
opened
the
jewel
case
showing
it
to
be
empty
miss
cavanaugh
has
put
all
her
jewels
in
a
bank
vault
that
must
have
been
recently
said
the
investigator
his
brows
a
trifle
raised
only
yesterday
she
made
up
her
mind
about
it
very
suddenly
a
look
which
bat
scanlon
could
not
interpret
shot
across
face
a
tune
was
upon
his
lips
as
he
prowled
hands
deep
in
his
trousers
pockets
up
and
down
the
room
his
keen
eyes
missing
nothing
at
length
he
paused
and
looked
at
the
maid
once
more
i
have
always
admired
the
manner
in
which
miss
cavanaugh
has
her
hair
arranged
said
he
do
you
do
that
usually
sir
said
the
maid
but
with
a
little
shadow
upon
her
face
i
do
think
cares
for
my
work
sir
she
has
refused
to
have
me
touch
her
hair
for
the
last
few
mornings
too
bad
said
the
investigator
too
bad
once
more
he
began
walking
about
the
room
at
a
window
he
halted
and
looked
out
the
scaffolding
erected
by
the
workmen
who
had
apparently
been
engaged
in
pointing
the
wall
ran
sheer
to
the
roof
scanlon
went
to
the
investigator
side
and
also
looked
out
quite
a
job
to
hang
one
of
these
things
said
the
big
man
as
few
materials
as
you
can
do
with
and
all
the
strength
you
can
get
without
a
word
of
warning
climbed
out
upon
the
under
the
window
and
then
to
scanlon
amazement
he
dropped
upon
his
knees
evening
prayer
or
something
i
suppose
said
the
big
trainer
but
why
the
hurry
it
some
hours
till
sundown
the
investigator
picked
at
some
particles
of
mortar
adhering
to
the
planks
with
the
blade
of
a
knife
the
idea
of
cements
and
mortars
always
fascinated
me
said
he
their
cold
persistency
their
determination
to
outdo
nature
their
ability
to
join
things
foreign
to
each
other
is
admirable
there
is
quite
a
literature
on
the
subject
and
many
men
have
given
a
great
deal
of
study
to
the
improvement
of
these
most
necessary
agents
beside
the
knife
blade
he
also
had
resort
to
the
pocket
lens
which
scanlon
had
seen
him
use
at
stanwick
then
after
he
had
slipped
a
fragment
of
the
hardened
mortar
into
a
fold
of
his
pocketbook
he
reëntered
the
room
and
as
he
did
so
bat
scanlon
once
more
saw
the
look
in
his
face
which
he
had
seen
a
few
moments
before
and
which
he
had
failed
to
interpret
what
next
said
the
big
man
rather
helplessly
for
the
expression
was
as
mystifying
now
as
before
that
will
be
all
i
think
said
the
investigator
cheerfully
thank
you
to
the
maid
as
she
led
the
way
down
the
stairs
and
as
she
opened
the
street
door
for
them
he
added
please
say
to
miss
cavanaugh
that
we
are
extremely
obliged
to
her
and
that
our
call
has
been
far
from
wasted
even
though
we
were
unfortunate
enough
to
come
when
she
was
out
footnotes
for
the
details
of
the
campe
case

the
volume
entitled

special
detective
chapter
vii
some
new
developments
filled
a
finely
colored
meerschaum
from
the
jar
of
greek
tobacco
on
the
table
the
pipe
was
a
large
one
upon
the
stem
was
a
charging
boar
exceptionally
well
done
and
the
curving
bit
was
hard
gray
bone
that
combination
always
struck
me
as
an
exciting
smoke
observed
bat
scanlon
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
the
tobacco
like
most
things
from
the
balkans
is
a
little
unsettled
and
the
wild
porker
means
battle
with
every
bristle
it
was
no
ordinary
carver
who
gave
this
old
chap
his
warlike
look
said
as
he
tapped
the
boar
bristling
back
with
one
finger
no
less
a
person
than
pasquale
guiccioli
is
responsible
for
him
that
so
said
scanlon
it
seems
like
small
work
for
a
sculptor
of
his
displacement
it
was
merely
curiosity
he
wanted
to
test
this
sort
of
clay
as
a
medium
i
suppose
and
with
a
man
like
guiccioli
even
a
whim
must
result
in
something
like
a
masterpiece
it
was
just
about
the
time
of
that
turmoil
about
the
florentine
bronzes
and
a
bad
light
was
thrown
on
the
old
man
by
persons
interested
in
spoiling
his
career
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
come
at
the
truth
of
the
matter
and
the
sculptor
in
an
outburst
of
italian
fervor
declared
that
i
might
name
any
of
his
possessions
as
a
reward
and
you
picked
the
pipe
eh
scanlon
drew
at
his
cigar
and
nodded
approval
but
his
eyes
went
from
the
meerschaum
to
a
sheet
of
white
letter
paper
upon
the
table
which
contained
some
fragments
of
hardened
mortar
gathered
in
two
little
heaps
if
you
are
ready
added
he
like
to
hear
why
you
are
so
interested
in
this
stuff
and
what
it
has
to
do
with
the
stanwick
murder
the
investigator
paced
up
and
down
the
room
the
smoke
from
the
pipe
lifted
about
him
in
small
eddies
as
he
moved
two
places
may
be
associated
mentally
said
and
yet
physically
they
may
be
as
far
apart
as
the
poles
at
the
beginning
of
this
affair
nora
cavanaugh
house
and
duncan
street
were
brought
together
in
my
mind
only
because
the
murdered
man
had
visited
both
on
the
night
of
his
death
but
and
laughed
mortar
is
a
most
adhesive
substance
and
it
is
holding
them
together
quite
firmly
i
do
get
you
affirmed
bat
a
line
of
doubt
across
his
forehead
make
it
a
little
plainer
will
you
at
stanwick
you
did
not
follow
me
over
the
ground
very
closely
except
a
few
times
when
i
specially
claimed
your
attention
just
before
i
found
the
revolver
under
the
fence
i
saw
a
second
footprint
in
the
sod
a
cautious
footprint
or
perhaps
would
be
better
it
was
that
of
a
man
and
he
had
gone
tiptoeing
lightly
around
with
long
steps
and
in
a
most
erratic
manner
why
did
you
mention
it
asked
bat
scanlon
somewhat
hurt
the
prints
were
few
they
were
also
light
and
dim
and
i
was
not
at
all
sure
that
they
meant
anything
however
at
the
other
side
of
the
house
i
saw
them
again
but
after
a
few
yards
i
lost
them
huh
said
bat
scanlon
but
just
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
spot
in
which
they
disappeared
continued
the
investigator
i
noted
something
else
my
lens
showed
me
the
impress
in
the
sod
of
something
like
a
woven
fabric
my
first
thought
was
that
some
one
had
been
walking
about
in
his
stockings
but
a
closer
inspection
told
me
that
the
outline
was
much
too
rigid
for
that
and
then
i
realized
what
had
happened
the
man
who
had
been
tiptoeing
so
quietly
about
had
stopped
at
that
point
and
drawn
a
pair
of
woolen
over
his
shoes
no
bat
started
up
in
sudden
excitement
that
a
good
point
it
shows
that
this
fellow
whatever
else
he
was
was
no
amateur
the
creeper
thing
is
a
regular
burglar
stunt
nodded
i
think
you
are
right
said
he
at
any
rate
it
was
this
gentleman
who
tried
to
lift
himself
up
to
the
window
and
in
so
doing
left
that
interesting
little
ridge
of
earth
on
the
cellar
grating
yes
of
course
said
scanlon
that
be
him
sure
to
the
unaided
eye
proceeded
the
scrapings
seemed
but
fragments
of
soil
but
the
lens
showed
me
something
more
mixed
with
the
earth
were
some
whitish
particles
these
and
he
indicated
one
of
the
little
heaps
of
crumbled
lime
association
and
the
investigator
looked
at
his
friend
steadily
is
one
of
the
commonest
faculties
of
the
mind
and
as
soon
as
i
realized
what
the
particles
were
an
idea
took
shape
an
idea
said
bat
with
a
feeling
of
uneasiness
growing
upon
him
what
sort
of
an
idea
true
coincidence
said
is
so
infrequent
an
occurrence
that
i
seldom
consider
it
the
presence
of
the
lime
upon
the
cellar
grating
had
no
value
of
course
but
as
you
know
a
poker
player
will
sometimes
retain
cards
in
his
hand
which
are
worth
nothing
in
themselves
on
the
chance
that
he
may
draw
certain
others
and
once
these
drawn
the
heretofore
valueless
cards
become
of
superlative
importance
there
was
a
pause
bat
scanlon
knew
the
weight
of
this
illustration
and
sat
in
nervous
expectation
of
what
was
to
follow
i
had
this
idea
in
mind
when
i
stepped
on
the
scaffolding
outside
miss
cavanaugh
window
proceeded
the
maid
said
the
workmen
had
not
been
on
the
job
for
some
days
and
so
my
search
was
not
difficult
there
were
a
great
many
footprints
unquestionably
of
the
mechanics
but
on
top
of
these
plain
and
undisturbed
were
the
impressions
of
the
which
i
had
seen
in
the
sod
at
duncan
street
you
are
sure
said
bat
scanlon
in
a
flat
throaty
voice
there
no
mistake
not
any
replied
the
investigator
quietly
scanlon
dropped
the
end
of
his
cigar
into
a
pewter
bowl
upon
the
table
then
he
lighted
another
and
lay
back
in
his
chair
his
brows
drawn
together
in
a
heavy
frown
all
right
said
he
we
let
it
go
at
that
there
was
a
yegg
of
some
kind
scouting
around
nora
house
and
the
same
lad
also
took
some
observations
of
the
place
at
stanwick
we
have
that
all
settled
and
now
what
does
it
mean
smiled
i
do
know
said
he
but
suppose
we
try
to
find
out
he
took
the
telephone
receiver
from
the
hook
and
asked
for
police
headquarters
in
a
few
moments
he
had
the
person
required
hello
devlin
said
he
this
is
oh
how
are
you
came
the
big
voice
of
captain
devlin
of
the
detective
staff
osborne
was
just
talking
about
you
said
you
got
kind
of
a
rap
across
the
knuckles
on
that
stanwick
job
we
must
all
expect
setbacks
now
and
then
replied
the
investigator
smoothly
i
get
mine
with
more
or
less
regularity
the
captain
of
detectives
laughed
loudly
his
mirth
came
over
the
wire
in
booming
flares
of
pleasure
that
so
said
he
we
all
get
it
there
was
an
instant
pause
then
he
added
anything
i
can
do
for
you
i
wanted
to
ask
about
any
cracksmen
who
might
be
in
town
at
this
time
said
the
investigator
there
a
few
replied
devlin
what
the
name
of
the
party
you
want
i
have
no
name
but
i
can
give
you
some
details
of
description
cautious
in
his
habits
goes
about
his
work
carefully
he
small
and
has
large
feet
that
wo
fit
any
one
i
know
said
the
other
there
is
no
regular
burglar
hereabouts
just
now
who
is
what
you
call
small
but
the
other
two
counts
being
cautious
and
having
big
feet
would
fit
big
slim
ah
scanlon
saw
eyes
snap
big
slim
i
take
it
that
he
is
a
tall
man
lightly
built
that
right
answered
devlin
a
regular
slat
have
you
any
idea
where
he
could
be
found
he
often
seen
at
duke
sheehan
on
claridge
street
that
a
kind
of
for
him
then
with
a
note
of
interest
in
his
voice
the
captain
of
detectives
added
got
anything
on
him
i
do
know
replied
i
be
able
to
tell
better
in
a
day
or
two
after
a
few
general
remarks
he
hung
up
the
receiver
turned
toward
scanlon
and
told
him
of
what
devlin
had
said
but
bat
continued
to
look
puzzled
you
asked
for
a
cautious
crook
who
was
small
and
had
big
feet
where
did
you
get
all
that
the
fact
that
he
wore
showed
that
he
was
a
man
to
take
unnecessary
chances
the
impressions
on
the
sod
at
stanwick
were
quite
faint
that
indicated
a
light
man
and
so
i
thought
of
him
as
being
small
however
a
tall
man
of
frail
build
would
make
about
the
same
sort
of
a
footprint
and
in
his
case
the
large
size
of
the
feet
is
more
easily
accounted
for
i
get
you
said
bat
he
arose
to
his
feet
the
fresh
cigar
held
between
his
teeth
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
leaned
against
a
corner
of
the
table
and
watched
him
with
observant
eyes
and
finally
as
the
big
man
continued
to
tramp
up
and
down
in
silence
the
investigator
said
quietly
there
are
some
things
in
this
whole
matter
which
make
you
uneasy
seen
that
from
the
first
you
even
feared
to
uncover
little
things
which
might
be
truths
because
you
did
not
know
just
where
they
would
lead
scanlon
paused
and
regarded
his
friend
with
troubled
eyes
you
are
right
said
he
from
the
very
first
i
been
as
nervous
as
a
roomful
of
old
maids
with
dinner
ten
minutes
late
it
had
a
queer
look
somehow
and
as
i
seen
more
of
it
the
queerness
do
get
any
less
just
at
this
point
spoke
the
investigator
we
reach
a
sort
of
crisis
certain
things
must
be
faced
what
you
have
been
fearing
and
what
i
have
been
realizing
with
increasing
clearness
with
every
step
we
took
must
now
be
considered
openly
and
freely
bat
cleared
his
throat
huskily
you
mean
nora
cavanaugh
he
said
i
mean
nora
cavanaugh
replied
the
other
evenly
scanlon
resumed
his
pacing
i
ca
deny
it
said
he
she
keeping
something
back
i
saw
that
or
rather
i
felt
it
from
the
start
i
do
understand
why
doing
it
and
i
ca
imagine
what
it
is
but
she
ai
told
all
she
knows
and
she
do
mean
to
tell
it
at
side
the
man
paused
and
laid
a
hand
upon
his
arm
and
now
that
we
on
this
subject
said
he
and
talking
plain
what
did
you
get
from
the
marks
on
her
temple
she
said
it
was
an
accident
due
to
her
maid
carelessness
the
maid
when
questioned
showed
clearly
that
she
knew
nothing
of
it
that
convinced
me
that
miss
cavanaugh
desired
to
hide
the
cause
of
the
bruise
her
refusal
to
permit
the
girl
to
touch
her
hair
on
the
morning
after
the
murder
makes
it
plain
that
she
had
some
reason
for
desiring
the
mark
to
remain
unseen
i
on
that
she
did
get
the
mark
as
she
said
said
scanlon
but
how
she
get
it
that
is
another
thing
which
it
is
impossible
to
make
sure
of
at
this
time
replied
but
merely
as
a
suggestion
mind
you
i
recall
that
the
bounder
visited
her
on
the
night
it
happened
he
struck
her
you
mean
bat
hands
clenched
and
his
great
shoulders
heaved
the
infernal
cur
that
would
be
just
like
him
another
suggestion
which
i
like
to
make
spoke
is
one
which
may
or
may
not
be
significant
the
maid
said
miss
cavanaugh
put
her
jewels
in
a
bank
vault
the
morning
after
his
visit
bat
scanlon
stiffened
up
an
exclamation
upon
his
lips
one
fist
smacked
into
an
open
palm
as
he
cried
you
hit
it
she
just
came
in
from
the
theatre
and
she
was
wearing
the
diamonds
when
she
refused
him
money
he
grabbed
them
she
resisted
and
he
struck
her
you
may
be
correct
said
the
investigator
he
was
keen
calm
impersonal
it
was
as
though
the
entire
matter
were
a
game
the
intricate
possibilities
of
which
were
just
being
uncovered
but
scanlon
was
much
excited
the
more
the
thing
grew
and
took
shape
in
his
mind
the
more
agitated
he
became
and
if
you
are
right
proceeded
we
can
perhaps
guess
as
to
what
followed
something
like
a
shudder
ran
through
scanlon
big
frame
i
know
what
you
mean
he
said
that
thing
has
been
lying
like
a
shadow
across
my
mind
from
the
beginning
nora
cavanaugh
is
a
woman
of
spirit
the
man
who
struck
her
would
risk
but
the
other
interrupted
him
we
not
think
of
shadows
said
he
quietly
they
will
land
us
nowhere
what
we
are
going
to
do
is
light
the
lamps
along
the
road
this
thing
leads
us
in
that
way
only
can
we
get
a
good
look
at
the
facts
facts
bat
put
one
strong
hand
on
shoulder
as
i
feel
now
facts
are
about
the
last
things
i
want
to
deal
with
suppose
the
police
found
this
out
that
the
rascal
of
a
husband
had
visited
nora
to
get
money
from
her
that
he
had
struck
her
and
taken
her
jewels
and
that
she
had
but
slapped
him
upon
the
back
do
wear
out
your
nerves
conjuring
up
things
which
maybe
never
have
or
never
will
happen
said
he
you
have
use
for
them
and
at
once
for
there
is
some
snappy
work
to
be
done
and
i
want
your
help
right
responded
scanlon
with
an
instinctive
grasping
at
his
old
habit
of
manner
and
thought
what
can
i
do
i
be
engaged
in
another
phase
of
the
thing
for
a
couple
of
days
and
in
the
meantime
i
like
to
have
you
go
to
duke
sheehan
place
and
look
out
for
the
gentleman
devlin
calls
big
slim
if
possible
get
acquainted
with
him
and
find
out
anything
of
value
he
may
have
good
enough
said
bat
an
acquaintance
with
that
guy
is
one
of
the
things
i
framed
up
for
the
near
future
i
interested
in
why
he
was
promenading
around
on
the
scaffold
at
nora
window
and
why
he
shifted
his
attention
to
stanwick
in
such
a
hurry
bat
looked
at
his
hat
which
lay
upon
the
table
and
then
to
once
more
any
particular
time
you
like
me
to
take
up
this
job
inquired
he
the
sooner
the
better
was
the
prompt
reply
that
means
now
said
the
big
man
as
he
took
up
the
hat
first
go
back
to
my
shop
and
dress
for
the
occasion
then
i
drift
into
sheehan
just
as
natural
as
you
please
and
see
what
to
be
seen
chapter
viii
scanlon
makes
a
new
acquaintance
duke
sheehan
place
was
on
claridge
street
near
to
a
prominent
avenue
it
glittered
hideously
with
signs
canopies
of
flagrantly
stained
glass
hung
over
each
door
and
window
at
the
entrance
the
thick
breath
of
the
place
met
one
like
a
wall
it
smelled
heavily
of
dregs
both
of
drink
and
humanity
the
walls
shone
with
mirrors
the
brilliant
lights
were
reflected
on
the
polished
bar
the
floor
was
closely
set
with
colored
tile
and
upon
this
the
duke
patrons
spat
freely
and
spilled
the
foam
from
their
beer
bat
scanlon
in
a
rough
but
suit
of
clothes
and
a
cloth
cap
pulled
down
over
his
head
lounged
at
the
bar
and
took
in
the
place
and
its
possibilities
it
the
kind
of
a
dump
much
sought
after
by
the
youth
from
the
rural
sections
when
he
wants
to
see
life
commented
the
big
man
mentally
there
is
one
thing
to
be
said
for
this
choice
and
that
is
he
have
to
go
far
to
be
trimmed
there
a
helping
hand
on
every
side
a
man
who
stood
with
whistling
breath
next
to
scanlon
now
said
what
you
have
bo
i
doing
this
bat
looked
apologetic
excuse
me
he
said
i
on
the
wagon
and
holding
tight
booze
good
for
a
game
like
i
playing
the
man
laughed
wanly
i
do
know
your
game
said
he
but
maybe
you
right
at
that
it
beats
the
dickens
how
things
break
for
if
it
was
for
the
souse
croaked
long
ago
he
nodded
to
the
barkeeper
who
supplied
him
with
a
dirty
looking
bottle
and
a
wet
glass
have
a
cigar
he
asked
bat
sure
responded
bat
agreeably
there
no
rule
against
that
he
lighted
the
cigar
which
burned
badly
and
threw
out
a
yellowish
smoke
the
man
saw
the
disfavor
in
bat
look
and
grinned
burns
like
a
salad
do
it
i
never
smoke
myself
i
got
a
cough
and
the
doc
against
it
as
though
to
prove
his
statement
he
coughed
persistently
for
a
full
minute
then
with
a
breath
whistling
thinly
in
his
throat
he
poured
the
strong
liquor
through
it
yes
sir
gasped
he
holding
to
the
bar
with
weak
hands
if
it
for
the
old
stuff
i
passed
in
my
last
check
before
now
it
keeps
me
going
great
goods
then
with
a
look
of
commiseration
at
bat
he
added
but
maybe
it
just
as
well
you
off
it
me
and
it
do
hook
up
right
bat
confided
to
him
it
gets
my
hand
out
i
ca
stand
it
the
way
fellows
like
you
do
the
man
surveyed
the
speaker
big
form
and
a
look
of
gratification
came
into
his
face
i
guess
that
so
said
he
i
kind
of
under
weight
but
i
a
pretty
tough
guy
for
all
if
it
was
for
the
cough
i
be
holding
my
own
and
say
on
the
square
i
think
the
old
juice
is
putting
the
cough
away
i
do
for
a
fact
and
if
it
does
and
i
can
get
some
sleep
at
night
maybe
i
come
through
anyway
sure
said
bat
sociably
sure
thing
the
eyes
of
the
big
athlete
searched
the
place
as
they
had
done
a
dozen
times
since
he
entered
but
there
was
no
one
present
who
answered
to
the
description
he
had
of
the
burglar
big
slim
the
doc
ai
strong
for
the
stuff
proceeded
the
man
he
been
knocking
to
get
me
to
shut
it
off
but
he
do
understand
my
constitution
like
i
do
here
there
was
a
sudden
hubbub
of
voices
at
the
other
end
of
the
bar
through
the
confusion
a
voice
declared
excitedly
i
gon
na
beat
him
up
that
goes
do
you
hear
i
gon
na
flatten
the
big
stiff
he
made
a
monkey
outa
me
and
he
ai
gon
na
get
away
with
it
a
half
dozen
voices
protested
against
this
at
one
time
duke
sheehan
in
his
shirt
sleeves
and
diamonds
leaned
over
the
bar
do
be
a
nut
now
remonstrated
he
a
guy
in
your
line
push
wants
to
do
all
his
fighting
in
the
ring
if
he
do
he
get
a
bad
name
all
the
voices
began
to
sound
once
more
and
bat
scanlon
glanced
at
the
man
at
his
side
it
looks
like
trouble
of
some
kind
said
he
the
man
who
had
ordered
another
drink
out
of
the
dirty
little
bottle
nodded
that
big
fellow
that
sheehan
talking
to
is
push
allen
the
fighter
he
comes
all
the
way
from
thinking
he
was
matched
with
a
guy
but
when
he
gets
here
he
finds
his
manager
ai
put
up
the
dough
to
make
the
thing
good
and
so
he
stung
that
bad
behavior
said
scanlon
very
bad
allen
will
pick
his
managers
better
next
time
this
guy
ai
no
regular
manager
said
the
man
a
fellow
that
knocking
around
doing
job
work
here
the
speaker
laughed
his
wan
laugh
they
call
him
big
slim
oh
said
scanlon
i
see
without
further
ado
he
dropped
the
evil
smelling
cigar
and
moved
toward
the
place
where
an
excited
knot
of
men
were
gathered
gesticulating
and
expostulating
about
the
aggrieved
pugilist
the
latter
was
a
burly
fellow
with
wide
shoulders
a
small
round
head
and
a
protruding
jaw
his
eyes
were
inflamed
with
drink
and
he
was
glowering
savagely
at
those
about
him
fourth
rate
was
bat
scanlon
mental
appraisement
of
the
fellow
an
ugly
fighter
and
i
gamble
a
foul
one
i
was
working
along
nice
in
the
west
spoke
allen
doing
fine
and
then
this
boob
gets
me
to
come
here
on
a
sure
thing
he
says
do
you
take
me
for
some
kind
of
a
dope
he
demanded
angrily
of
those
about
him
do
you
want
me
to
stand
for
a
thing
like
that
again
the
hubbub
arose
and
while
it
was
going
on
bat
felt
a
touch
on
his
arm
he
looked
around
and
found
the
man
beside
him
gee
said
this
gentleman
excitedly
ai
it
fierce
there
big
slim
now
bat
looked
toward
the
place
indicated
and
saw
a
very
tall
and
very
man
with
shifty
eyes
and
a
furtive
manner
his
arms
were
almost
monstrously
long
and
the
hands
at
the
end
of
them
were
big
and
bony
his
narrow
shoulders
were
stooped
a
barkeeper
beckoned
to
him
almost
frantically
scanlon
saw
the
burglar
loom
angularly
toward
the
bar
and
heard
him
ask
in
a
thin
voice
what
the
trouble
allen
back
there
said
the
barkeeper
with
a
jerk
of
the
thumb
toward
the
crowd
surrounding
the
pugilist
he
going
to
lay
you
out
bat
saw
the
eyes
shift
toward
the
group
like
those
of
a
leopard
and
the
glint
in
them
was
equally
evil
lay
me
out
said
the
thin
voice
coldly
i
guess
not
big
slim
leaned
against
the
bar
and
pulled
the
fingers
of
one
big
bony
hand
until
the
joints
cracked
evidently
the
barkeeper
did
not
like
this
as
a
sign
for
he
at
once
waved
the
proprietor
to
the
spot
suppose
you
take
a
walk
slim
requested
sheehan
the
duke
checked
waistcoat
came
well
down
over
his
swollen
stomach
his
moustache
was
of
the
walrus
type
and
he
always
seemed
acutely
aware
of
the
splendor
of
his
rings
and
pins
allen
letting
off
steam
and
i
do
want
him
to
see
you
i
not
going
to
dodge
allen
stated
the
burglar
i
told
him
how
the
thing
happened
and
he
ai
got
no
cause
for
excitement
duke
sheehan
put
his
thumbs
in
the
armholes
of
the
elaborate
waistcoat
all
right
said
he
nonchalantly
just
as
you
like
but
i
do
want
to
see
you
going
around
with
your
hoops
loosened
that
all
as
bat
scanlon
listened
the
wording
of
request
passed
through
his
mind
go
to
sheehan
place
the
investigator
had
said
and
look
out
for
the
gentleman
called
big
slim
if
possible
get
acquainted
with
him
and
find
out
anything
of
value
he
might
have
if
i
had
been
making
chances
thought
bat
i
could
have
made
a
better
one
than
this
if
the
slim
one
is
at
all
now
is
the
time
so
he
moved
along
the
bar
until
he
was
at
the
burglar
side
friend
said
he
i
like
to
see
a
guy
with
insides
the
man
who
says
stick
right
here
no
matter
what
the
other
fellow
got
is
the
kind
i
warm
to
the
shifty
eyes
glinted
wickedly
i
separate
his
ribs
for
him
said
he
if
he
bothers
with
now
here
none
of
that
cried
the
startled
out
of
his
easy
humor
no
knife
or
gun
stuff
slim
do
you
hear
but
it
is
doubtful
if
big
slim
did
hear
for
just
then
the
infuriated
fighting
man
caught
sight
of
him
swept
aside
the
throng
and
advanced
so
here
you
are
eh
allen
little
head
was
thrust
forward
and
his
jaw
protruded
wickedly
well
what
have
you
got
to
say
for
yourself
before
i
knock
your
block
off
the
intimates
of
the
pugilist
had
been
prolific
of
words
while
hostilities
were
still
in
the
distance
but
they
knew
the
ugly
nature
of
the
man
and
now
held
their
peace
but
bat
scanlon
his
mind
firmly
furnished
with
a
plan
of
action
slowly
moved
into
the
space
between
allen
and
the
object
of
his
anger
speaking
of
knocking
heads
off
said
he
let
me
put
you
up
in
something
that
always
goes
with
that
little
performance
he
laid
a
hand
on
the
broad
chest
of
the
pugilist
always
pick
your
man
said
he
and
for
your
own
sake
never
let
him
carry
less
beef
than
yourself
get
out
of
the
road
growled
push
allen
viciously
this
fellow
and
bat
nodded
calmly
toward
big
slim
is
a
good
forty
pounds
less
than
you
now
i
happen
to
be
a
friend
of
his
and
but
before
he
could
speak
another
word
the
pugilist
aimed
a
furious
blow
at
him
bat
stooped
under
it
and
continued
he
i
wo
see
you
or
anybody
else
again
came
a
terrific
drive
from
allen
but
bat
put
it
aside
deftly
and
as
he
stepped
forward
his
power
of
body
forced
the
other
put
anything
over
on
him
finished
scanlon
you
wo
eh
push
allen
glared
like
a
tiger
well
let
see
if
you
can
stop
me
from
putting
over
something
on
you
like
a
mad
beast
he
rushed
at
the
big
athlete
his
arms
swinging
in
smashing
blows
but
not
one
of
them
landed
with
an
agility
that
made
the
spectators
open
their
eyes
bat
and
ducked
a
confident
smile
upon
his
lips
then
with
incredible
ease
he
stepped
in
and
landed
a
clean
snappy
hook
which
tumbled
the
pugilist
over
in
a
surprised
heap
a
smothered
shout
went
up
duke
sheehan
came
from
behind
his
bar
as
several
men
lifted
the
rather
dazed
fighting
man
to
his
feet
now
look
spoke
sheehan
this
goes
any
saloon
i
keep
is
never
intended
for
a
so
draw
the
curtain
on
that
stuff
of
yours
allen
it
get
me
into
trouble
the
pugilist
made
not
very
strenuous
efforts
to
put
aside
those
who
had
gathered
about
him
where
is
that
guy
demanded
he
where
is
he
i
fix
him
for
that
the
insincerity
of
the
voice
caught
sheehan
attention
he
smiled
satirically
and
winked
at
big
slim
get
him
out
of
here
ordered
the
briefly
i
do
want
the
cops
here
get
him
out
and
pile
him
up
somewhere
till
he
sober
allen
made
no
very
violent
protests
at
being
taken
out
and
after
gone
he
resumed
his
place
behind
the
bar
looking
with
much
interest
at
scanlon
he
said
what
are
you
going
to
have
big
fellow
bat
waved
a
hand
not
any
thanks
but
if
you
pass
over
a
cigarette
i
see
what
i
can
do
with
that
a
box
of
cigarettes
was
thrown
before
him
on
the
polished
bar
and
as
he
lighted
one
of
them
sheehan
leaned
toward
him
that
was
nice
work
spoke
he
pretty
clean
ever
done
much
of
it
it
used
to
be
my
said
the
big
athlete
long
time
ago
though
big
slim
extended
one
of
his
bony
hands
i
much
obliged
said
he
that
was
a
good
turn
you
done
me
that
all
right
said
bat
offhandedly
you
ai
got
the
weight
to
mix
it
with
him
and
i
saw
you
was
going
to
pull
a
gun
or
something
no
use
to
let
yourself
get
in
bad
you
know
sheehan
lingered
a
little
talking
to
the
two
but
when
he
finally
went
away
to
attend
to
a
party
of
spenders
who
had
just
come
in
big
slim
said
been
in
this
burg
long
not
very
ai
doing
very
well
either
they
told
me
money
here
was
as
loose
as
dust
but
i
do
see
any
of
it
flying
around
me
the
burglar
cracked
his
long
bony
fingers
it
something
fierce
when
it
begins
to
break
bad
ai
it
philosophized
he
i
thought
i
had
a
good
thing
when
i
got
that
big
cheese
allen
to
come
on
here
a
nice
easy
match
with
a
fellow
who
could
fight
enough
to
keep
himself
warm
and
with
a
ton
of
money
behind
him
tough
luck
sympathized
bat
sometimes
went
on
big
slim
the
kale
is
easy
to
get
i
seen
it
come
in
clouds
for
weeks
at
a
time
and
it
never
looked
easier
than
it
did
when
i
made
the
arrangements
for
allen
i
had
above
two
bits
to
my
name
but
i
knew
where
i
could
shake
down
five
thousand
just
by
moving
my
hand
nice
and
soft
admired
bat
how
it
work
it
did
stated
the
burglar
missed
fire
from
the
jump
i
never
seen
anything
like
it
the
stuff
was
as
good
as
in
my
hand
and
then
pop
it
all
went
overboard
gosh
that
gets
your
nerve
do
it
said
bat
exasperated
i
had
little
things
turn
over
for
me
like
that
if
you
want
to
make
sure
of
a
thing
said
big
slim
never
get
into
a
game
that
a
woman
in
you
never
can
tell
what
they
do
once
more
he
cracked
his
finger
joints
with
remarkable
distinctness
it
was
an
easy
five
thousand
in
sparks
that
would
have
peddled
at
sight
sparks
said
bat
softly
hah
now
you
talking
nothing
better
i
had
them
framed
for
a
month
said
the
burglar
some
of
them
was
as
big
as
that
indicating
the
nail
of
a
little
finger
i
lost
out
on
the
deal
bo
but
that
not
all
with
a
wink
and
a
shake
of
the
head
more
to
follow
and
this
time
i
get
mine
you
can
bet
when
i
start
out
but
here
he
stopped
suddenly
and
bat
saw
the
green
eyes
shift
in
their
sidelong
look
and
felt
himself
being
examined
suspiciously
he
just
remembered
that
he
do
know
who
i
am
was
scanlon
mental
comment
and
the
caution
that
kirk
spoke
of
comes
to
the
top
in
a
hurry
however
bat
made
no
sign
that
he
noticed
the
change
in
the
manner
he
even
yawned
a
little
as
he
said
too
bad
but
we
got
to
expect
it
now
and
then
what
your
monicker
asked
big
slim
and
where
are
you
stopping
name
scanlon
said
bat
truthfully
and
that
just
reminds
me
that
i
got
to
hunt
up
a
home
for
the
night
before
it
too
late
flying
light
asked
the
burglar
a
little
that
way
i
know
a
place
where
they
do
tax
you
too
much
said
the
man
stopping
there
myself
fine
said
bat
when
you
have
the
mind
lead
me
to
it
all
right
said
big
slim
i
do
think
the
wild
for
me
sticking
around
just
now
seeing
that
allen
might
come
back
so
better
blow
if
you
ready
i
am
right
behind
you
said
bat
cheerfully
and
then
without
more
ado
the
two
passed
out
into
the
night
chapter
ix
a
place
of
fear
big
slim
lived
at
bohlmier
this
was
a
little
hotel
in
a
huddled
section
of
the
city
and
had
the
swiss
coat
of
arms
on
a
sign
at
the
door
i
always
pick
out
little
islands
where
i
be
quiet
and
where
no
one
comes
poking
around
said
the
lank
burglar
the
swift
places
are
the
kind
to
pass
up
there
was
a
little
sanded
office
with
prints
of
the
rhine
castles
of
the
alps
of
mountain
folk
with
their
goats
old
bohlmier
with
his
bald
head
and
big
spectacles
sat
behind
a
high
desk
peering
at
a
much
thumbed
scrap
of
music
and
blowing
the
notes
upon
a
flute
friend
of
mine
announced
big
slim
indicating
scanlon
wants
a
room
so
bohlmier
put
down
the
flute
and
looked
at
the
big
athlete
over
the
rims
of
his
spectacles
yah
i
suppose
i
haf
one
yet
he
arose
and
opened
a
small
register
your
name
you
will
put
inside
here
he
directed
scanlon
did
as
requested
then
the
proprietor
toiled
in
a
fashion
up
the
stairs
before
them
unlocked
a
door
and
stood
aside
for
scanlon
to
enter
the
room
was
small
and
slimly
furnished
but
it
was
clean
and
had
two
windows
peering
upon
what
looked
in
the
dimness
like
a
courtyard
if
you
do
not
der
stable
mind
suggested
bohlmier
der
ventilation
is
goot
by
der
windows
nice
said
bat
this
will
do
me
great
when
the
proprietor
had
gone
big
slim
shuffled
about
the
room
his
hands
in
his
pockets
the
dutchman
real
said
he
to
bat
i
known
him
for
some
time
and
he
in
on
more
than
anybody
would
think
the
athlete
threw
some
cigarettes
upon
the
table
and
drew
up
two
chairs
sit
down
said
he
with
a
ready
air
of
ownership
let
get
better
acquainted
not
now
replied
big
slim
some
other
time
maybe
i
open
a
can
of
experience
with
you
but
and
he
leered
knowingly
i
got
a
little
business
all
right
said
bat
i
see
you
then
sure
said
the
lank
burglar
i
do
want
to
lose
sight
of
you
pal
for
i
owe
you
one
oh
that
all
right
said
scanlon
as
he
shook
hands
with
the
other
at
the
room
door
it
was
only
a
little
for
a
freight
car
like
me
scanlon
stood
in
the
doorway
and
watched
the
angular
figure
go
down
the
hall
there
was
something
so
slinking
so
furtively
deadly
in
the
burglar
motions
that
bat
felt
a
prickly
sensation
run
up
and
down
his
spine
that
the
kind
of
a
fellow
that
would
snuff
out
your
light
and
never
lose
an
hour
sleep
over
it
said
the
big
athlete
to
himself
a
wolf
a
prowling
wolf
but
just
as
kirk
thought
he
got
something
inside
that
lean
head
of
his
that
i
ought
to
know
about
and
i
mean
to
know
it
big
slim
turned
a
sharp
angle
and
disappeared
from
view
but
scanlon
stood
looking
down
the
hall
and
thinking
the
corridor
was
low
ceilinged
and
narrow
the
lights
were
dim
and
the
doors
ran
in
an
unbroken
line
on
either
side
each
with
a
black
number
upon
it
nice
pronounced
bat
every
thing
clean
and
orderly
the
old
swiss
is
there
with
the
soap
and
dust
brush
i
hand
it
to
him
for
that
but
he
paused
and
a
wrinkle
appeared
between
his
eyes
yes
the
place
was
much
better
than
he
had
expected
that
is
as
far
as
he
could
see
but
sometimes
there
were
things
not
to
be
seen
if
you
were
aware
of
them
at
all
you
them
and
as
bat
scanlon
stood
looking
down
the
dim
hall
with
its
two
rows
of
expressionless
doors
he
was
aware
of
a
peculiar
something
from
which
his
mind
drew
back
rising
from
an
invisible
source
much
as
a
miasma
arises
from
a
marsh
there
came
a
subtle
quality
an
impression
of
evil
it
seemed
to
creep
by
and
around
him
silently
insidiously
poisonously
the
big
man
stepped
into
his
room
and
quietly
closed
the
door
then
grimly
he
slipped
a
huge
colt
revolver
from
a
holster
hooked
under
the
left
armhole
of
his
vest
with
a
snap
he
threw
it
open
and
the
ejector
threw
the
black
oily
murderous
looking
cartridges
upon
the
table
with
a
rattle
bat
inspected
and
tested
the
working
parts
of
the
weapon
satisfied
that
all
was
right
he
replaced
the
cartridges
with
practiced
fingers
i
only
had
that
feeling
once
before
in
my
life
said
he
and
that
was
the
night
in
dacy
place
at
holdover
when
the
four
were
waiting
for
me
in
the
dark
room
he
put
the
colt
back
in
its
holster
and
stood
ruminating
what
was
it
the
burglar
fellow
said
about
the
skipper
of
this
outfit
in
on
more
than
anybody
would
think
well
i
better
watch
myself
and
bat
smiled
though
his
eyes
narrowed
at
the
same
time
for
when
a
old
simp
with
a
flute
is
on
the
cross
he
sure
to
be
the
limit
the
surprise
kind
of
crook
always
is
he
walked
the
floor
for
a
few
moments
then
he
shot
the
bolt
on
the
door
and
stretched
himself
across
the
low
iron
cot
with
the
light
turned
off
bat
scanlon
mind
was
not
a
particularly
imaginative
one
but
at
the
same
time
it
possessed
one
of
the
attributes
of
the
imaginative
type
and
that
was
the
mental
antennæ
which
felt
things
while
they
were
still
in
the
distance
as
he
lay
there
upon
the
hard
bed
in
the
room
he
kept
sensing
something
but
could
get
no
clear
idea
of
its
shape
that
where
kirk
pins
on
the
medal
spoke
bat
these
things
never
come
to
him
done
up
in
fogs
they
are
always
pretty
clear
pictures
and
have
a
definite
meaning
however
vague
as
the
premonition
was
bat
was
confident
of
one
thing
that
was
whatever
shape
the
thing
took
it
would
have
something
to
do
with
the
affair
at
stanwick
maybe
i
believe
it
because
i
got
a
mind
full
of
the
stanwick
thing
scanlon
told
himself
a
fellow
does
fool
himself
that
way
sometimes
but
this
time
ai
one
of
them
before
i
get
out
of
this
phony
hotel
i
going
to
get
another
little
jolt
another
jolt
bat
whistled
between
his
teeth
in
dismay
were
there
not
jolts
enough
in
the
thing
already
one
by
one
as
he
lay
there
he
marshaled
his
impressions
in
his
mind
in
the
order
in
which
they
had
occurred
when
nora
first
called
him
on
the
telephone
there
had
unquestionably
been
a
note
of
fear
in
her
voice
in
her
dread
of
the
police
as
afterward
shown
he
fancied
he
recalled
something
more
than
the
shrinking
of
a
sensitive
nature
and
her
eagerness
to
know
what
was
going
forward
at
stanwick
was
well
it
was
curious
and
to
stanwick
he
had
gone
he
saw
the
ugly
evidence
of
a
brutal
crime
he
saw
a
sick
girl
very
much
attached
to
her
brother
who
quivered
with
dread
at
what
had
happened
and
who
so
he
fancied
was
even
in
a
deeper
state
of
fear
at
what
might
yet
come
to
pass
also
he
had
watched
and
listened
to
a
harassed
young
man
who
seemed
to
be
groping
his
way
amidst
the
bitter
resentments
of
years
the
frightful
actualities
of
the
moment
and
a
disconcerting
sense
of
impending
disaster
and
that
same
young
fellow
in
bad
said
the
big
man
to
the
darkness
of
the
little
room
the
cops
always
make
it
tough
for
the
man
they
pick
out
to
bear
the
weight
of
a
crime
they
try
and
twist
everything
to
point
his
way
and
after
this
came
the
evident
interest
of
in
the
matter
i
do
know
but
what
he
was
interested
even
before
that
thought
bat
he
saw
something
i
did
see
which
ai
hard
to
do
for
i
a
dub
at
that
kind
of
a
thing
he
remembered
that
nora
was
even
more
agitated
when
he
saw
her
again
than
she
had
been
the
first
time
young
burton
was
innocent
he
must
be
freed
she
he
did
do
it
she
how
did
she
bat
asked
himself
that
strong
talk
and
then
there
was
the
bruise
upon
her
forehead
nora
had
deceived
them
about
that
there
were
the
footprints
behind
the
rose
arbor
there
was
the
small
revolver
there
were
the
marks
of
the
creepers
in
the
yard
at
stanwick
and
upon
the
scaffold
outside
nora
window
and
then
there
was
also
the
apparently
sudden
resolution
upon
the
girl
part
to
place
her
jewels
in
a
place
of
security
people
do
get
these
sudden
notions
for
no
reason
at
all
mused
bat
and
nora
had
her
own
reasons
for
doing
that
but
and
there
was
a
little
tightening
of
his
mind
an
unpleasant
straining
which
made
him
want
to
draw
back
from
the
thought
she
did
want
to
tell
anything
about
it
i
believe
in
nora
nothing
could
drive
me
from
that
but
she
is
holding
back
on
us
she
knows
things
that
she
wo
tell
at
some
of
these
things
bat
could
guess
some
others
hints
had
partly
covered
but
the
background
the
reason
for
it
all
puzzled
him
he
pondered
deeply
for
a
long
time
but
not
a
ray
of
light
appeared
through
the
mists
that
obscured
the
matter
but
this
burglar
fellow
got
something
i
want
to
know
bat
sat
up
and
his
forceful
hands
shut
tightly
and
maybe
it
just
the
thing
we
need
maybe
it
just
the
he
stopped
when
he
had
turned
off
his
single
gas
jet
a
half
hour
before
all
had
been
dark
outside
now
there
was
a
flare
of
light
from
below
he
arose
and
looked
out
a
wall
loomed
across
the
courtyard
and
in
the
previous
darkness
he
had
thought
it
blank
but
now
he
saw
there
were
windows
in
it
and
two
of
them
on
the
ground
floor
were
illuminated
huh
said
bat
as
he
stood
looking
down
there
old
bohlmier
and
exercising
his
old
flute
again
the
bald
dome
of
the
old
swiss
shone
under
the
gas
light
the
scrap
of
thumbed
music
was
propped
up
against
a
bottle
and
he
was
blowing
gravely
into
his
instrument
his
fingers
moving
up
and
down
and
along
the
keys
with
methodical
precision
just
like
an
picture
said
bat
the
quaint
characteristics
of
the
composition
in
the
frame
of
the
window
appealing
to
him
i
wonder
if
i
not
been
a
little
hasty
with
these
notions
of
mine
about
this
place
that
old
lad
looks
as
harmless
as
but
he
stopped
for
the
composition
below
had
suddenly
changed
some
one
had
evidently
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
room
in
which
old
bohlmier
sat
one
hand
had
reached
in
a
clawing
motion
at
the
music
the
flute
was
held
pinned
to
the
table
in
a
bony
convulsive
grip
by
the
other
the
bald
head
was
thrust
forward
and
seemed
to
wave
gently
to
and
fro
like
that
of
a
snake
the
big
athlete
drew
in
his
breath
hissingly
the
bets
are
off
said
he
between
his
teeth
that
old
rat
got
it
in
him
i
bet
his
veins
run
ice
water
and
if
you
gave
him
the
chance
to
knife
a
man
you
be
doing
him
a
favor
the
swiss
had
apparently
spoken
to
whomever
had
knocked
and
now
although
still
invisible
to
bat
had
entered
the
room
bohlmier
leaned
back
in
his
chair
his
hands
clasped
before
him
but
from
the
motions
of
the
shiny
poll
bat
knew
he
was
speaking
that
room
must
be
somewhere
behind
the
office
bat
told
himself
maybe
a
private
den
of
the
old
fellow
here
bohlmier
suddenly
pushed
back
his
chair
and
stood
up
with
head
thrust
forward
once
more
he
seemed
to
stab
a
question
at
his
visitor
a
question
apparently
of
vast
importance
evidently
this
was
answered
to
the
liking
of
the
swiss
eagerly
triumphantly
inquiringly
one
hand
went
up
and
hung
pointing
across
the
room
to
a
point
behind
the
other
the
door
there
said
bat
intuitively
getting
the
meaning
of
the
gesture
and
on
the
other
side
of
it
is
some
one
or
something
the
old
man
been
expecting
to
see
then
there
followed
a
period
of
earnest
talk
between
the
and
the
unseen
visitor
it
was
carried
on
in
a
low
tone
bat
recognized
this
fact
by
the
attitudes
and
gestures
of
the
old
swiss
who
finally
with
almost
trembling
hands
pulled
open
a
drawer
in
the
table
at
which
he
had
been
seated
from
this
he
took
something
which
he
patted
almost
fondly
but
a
hand
came
across
the
table
the
hand
of
the
unknown
a
big
bony
hand
and
pushed
it
aside
it
big
slim
exclaimed
bat
with
fresh
interest
and
old
smooth
top
is
up
to
something
he
do
like
the
tall
burglar
now
came
into
view
he
sat
upon
the
corner
of
the
table
and
bent
his
head
toward
the
swiss
gesturing
angularly
with
no
good
humor
the
pulled
open
the
table
drawer
once
more
and
replaced
the
thing
he
had
taken
out
the
bald
head
wagged
in
protest
every
motion
he
made
suggested
a
man
convinced
against
his
will
deep
in
his
inner
consciousness
bat
scanlon
had
a
stirring
of
unrest
he
recalled
the
words
of
big
slim
while
they
were
still
at
sheehan
lost
out
on
that
deal
bo
but
that
not
all
more
to
follow
and
this
time
i
get
mine
and
then
the
business
of
which
he
had
spoken
when
he
left
bat
in
the
hall
only
a
short
time
before
i
wonder
if
it
could
have
anything
to
do
with
the
other
matter
bat
questioned
himself
i
wonder
if
what
they
are
talking
about
is
he
stopped
at
the
window
next
that
through
which
he
saw
the
men
he
caught
a
stir
a
shadow
a
woman
shadow
moved
stealthily
across
the
wall
toward
the
two
whose
backs
were
turned
the
hands
were
outstretched
as
though
reaching
for
something
then
the
woman
herself
appeared
in
the
full
flare
of
the
light
and
paused
at
a
small
stand
a
revolver
lay
there
and
it
was
for
this
she
was
reaching
as
she
took
it
up
she
turned
her
head
and
for
the
first
time
bat
had
a
full
view
of
her
face
it
was
nora
cavanaugh
chapter
x
through
the
window
for
a
moment
bat
scanlon
stood
as
one
petrified
there
was
nora
beautiful
nora
cavanaugh
the
yellow
light
in
the
meshes
of
the
glorious
bronze
hair
the
splendid
figure
held
tense
and
quivering
the
revolver
in
her
hand
and
her
face
turned
toward
the
two
men
then
he
exhaled
a
long
breath
and
wiped
the
drops
of
perspiration
from
his
face
it
nora
all
right
he
whispered
it
nora
but
what
in
the
name
of
the
seven
staggering
siwashes
is
she
doing
here
what
does
she
he
paused
abruptly
his
eyes
still
upon
her
with
the
revolver
held
tight
she
crept
stealthily
toward
big
slim
and
the
swiss
the
breath
drew
hard
in
bat
throat
as
he
proceeded
but
why
bother
to
ask
what
she
doing
if
i
ever
saw
a
person
meaning
spelled
out
in
full
by
the
actions
here
is
the
time
those
two
guys
at
the
table
have
only
another
second
or
two
and
then
they
are
due
for
the
surprise
of
their
lives
but
just
when
it
seemed
as
though
the
girl
could
reach
out
her
hand
and
touch
either
of
the
two
she
stopped
to
bat
surprise
she
sank
down
upon
her
knees
turned
her
head
sideways
and
was
motionless
what
that
demanded
bat
whisperingly
his
eyes
wide
open
she
doing
but
even
while
the
words
were
still
in
his
mouth
he
sensed
the
meaning
of
the
thing
shifting
his
position
to
the
other
window
he
saw
that
the
illuminated
windows
below
belonged
to
different
rooms
there
was
a
wall
between
nora
and
the
two
men
and
it
was
at
this
she
was
kneeling
one
ear
held
to
it
listening
ah
said
bat
that
it
eh
good
things
are
not
to
go
off
with
the
excited
bang
i
expected
i
have
at
least
a
couple
of
minutes
to
get
myself
in
hand
his
first
thought
was
of
the
big
colt
which
hung
under
his
arm
a
touch
assured
him
that
it
was
still
there
and
free
his
next
was
as
to
the
lay
of
the
land
to
reach
the
main
floor
was
simple
enough
but
how
to
get
to
the
rooms
in
which
were
nora
and
the
two
men
was
another
matter
as
he
weighed
the
situation
anxiously
an
idea
occurred
to
him
while
looking
along
the
hall
a
while
before
he
had
seen
a
small
red
light
burning
why
of
course
he
said
a
just
the
thing
it
sure
to
lead
down
into
this
courtyard
and
from
there
it
only
a
step
and
a
smash
and
i
in
and
asking
them
about
this
little
matter
quietly
he
opened
the
door
and
stepped
into
the
hall
the
red
light
burned
over
a
window
some
dozen
feet
away
he
lifted
the
sash
and
in
a
moment
was
out
upon
the
platform
below
all
was
darkness
save
for
the
light
which
came
from
the
two
windows
he
had
been
watching
and
down
into
this
shadowy
gulf
went
bat
with
careful
steps
the
courtyard
was
paved
with
the
uneven
stones
of
another
day
and
gingerly
bat
picked
his
way
across
it
toward
the
light
this
was
thrown
out
in
two
wide
shafts
which
met
and
merged
in
the
first
dozen
feet
of
their
projection
i
must
hang
around
on
the
edge
bat
reflected
if
i
dip
into
the
light
they
see
me
before
i
ready
to
have
them
do
so
craftily
he
approached
the
window
through
which
he
had
seen
nora
and
looked
in
she
was
still
there
but
was
now
erect
talking
with
some
one
whom
bat
could
not
see
she
stood
with
her
back
to
the
window
her
hands
behind
her
the
revolver
was
still
held
in
one
of
them
and
while
she
was
in
this
position
she
placed
it
upon
the
stand
clever
work
said
bat
as
he
watched
and
saw
the
manoeuvre
successfully
accomplished
disarming
in
the
face
of
the
enemy
and
the
said
enemy
never
the
wiser
but
i
wonder
why
the
armament
is
not
now
necessary
and
was
so
much
so
five
minutes
ago
he
shifted
a
little
taking
a
chance
of
being
seen
in
the
streaming
window
lights
the
person
to
whom
nora
was
talking
was
big
slim
the
burglar
leaned
upon
the
tall
back
of
a
chair
with
his
elbows
his
hands
propped
his
chin
and
he
was
steadfastly
watching
the
girl
and
listening
to
what
she
said
and
the
nora
whom
bat
now
saw
was
greatly
changed
from
the
cautiously
moving
fearfully
listening
creature
of
only
a
little
while
before
she
laughing
said
scanlon
amazed
laughing
she
was
with
her
splendid
head
thrown
back
her
teeth
shining
white
as
milk
and
then
as
she
spoke
to
the
lank
desperado
before
her
there
were
little
ripples
of
amusement
in
her
face
her
hands
gestured
as
though
in
mockery
but
all
this
won
no
reflection
in
the
cadaverous
mask
of
the
burglar
his
shifty
eyes
were
as
hard
as
stone
and
as
pitiless
he
changed
his
position
and
began
to
speak
his
utterances
seemed
slow
and
emotionless
his
whole
manner
was
of
disbelief
time
and
again
he
seemed
to
strike
at
the
same
point
and
bat
finally
realized
that
he
was
charging
the
girl
with
something
but
she
stood
before
him
the
look
of
amusement
still
in
her
face
her
beautiful
teeth
gleaming
when
she
laughed
finally
with
a
sweep
of
his
hand
big
slim
overset
the
chair
and
with
rigid
anger
in
his
hollow
face
moved
toward
her
the
big
colt
left
its
holster
and
appeared
in
scanlon
hand
in
the
lanky
gentleman
career
as
a
housebreaker
he
had
doubtless
had
many
narrow
shaves
but
never
had
he
stood
so
close
to
death
as
he
did
at
that
moment
and
it
was
the
girl
who
saved
him
with
a
gesture
of
amused
contempt
she
waved
him
back
turning
she
took
a
wrap
from
a
chair
and
threw
it
about
her
then
with
another
motion
one
of
command
she
stood
facing
him
she
telling
him
to
open
the
door
said
bat
and
amazedly
by
george
he
doing
it
for
the
tall
figure
of
big
slim
disappeared
into
a
part
of
the
room
outside
bat
vision
and
now
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
seen
her
shadow
crossing
the
wall
nora
cavanaugh
hesitated
for
a
flashing
instant
the
watcher
got
a
full
view
of
her
face
as
it
was
held
away
from
the
burglar
the
laughter
was
gone
in
its
place
was
fear
pale
dumb
fear
the
hands
which
fumbled
with
the
wrap
were
purposeless
with
no
direction
and
then
she
too
disappeared
out
of
the
range
of
the
watcher
vision
disregarding
all
thought
of
possible
detection
scanlon
now
approached
the
window
in
the
full
glare
of
the
light
he
saw
a
door
in
the
room
standing
open
and
through
this
nora
was
passing
then
the
burglar
pulled
it
shut
and
the
place
was
a
blank
bat
considered
for
only
an
instant
as
to
what
was
best
to
do
his
strong
fingers
gripped
at
the
sash
and
to
his
satisfaction
and
gratification
it
slid
upward
with
a
pull
he
had
lifted
his
heavy
body
upon
the
sill
and
was
in
the
room
his
steps
were
soft
and
long
as
he
moved
toward
the
door
through
which
the
two
had
just
gone
his
hand
was
reaching
out
for
the
knob
when
he
saw
it
turning
slowly
he
shrank
away
intuitively
and
against
the
wall
while
the
door
opened
with
him
behind
it
he
heard
a
hesitating
sort
of
breathing
and
then
a
step
within
the
room
around
the
edge
of
the
door
bat
could
see
the
gas
branch
as
it
projected
from
the
wall
a
hand
appeared
and
turned
off
the
light
then
the
footsteps
sounded
once
more
leaving
the
room
and
the
door
closed
as
softly
as
it
had
opened
bat
waited
for
a
few
moments
and
then
under
his
hand
the
door
opened
and
he
looked
out
there
was
a
short
and
rather
wide
hall
and
at
the
far
end
was
a
door
which
instantly
suggested
itself
as
the
one
leading
to
the
street
and
that
was
not
all
at
the
door
holding
it
open
about
an
inch
was
old
bohlmier
and
he
was
furtively
peering
out
he
was
the
party
who
turned
off
the
light
said
bat
as
he
drew
the
door
to
and
stood
waiting
in
a
little
while
there
was
a
faint
click
which
told
that
the
street
door
had
been
closed
then
bat
heard
the
old
swiss
enter
the
room
adjoining
the
one
in
which
the
athlete
had
seen
him
from
above
with
careful
steps
scanlon
went
down
the
short
hall
and
slipped
back
the
lock
peering
out
he
saw
a
narrow
street
and
a
taxi
standing
at
the
curb
in
this
was
nora
cavanaugh
and
beside
it
stood
big
slim
scanlon
saw
nora
perfectly
for
the
street
light
shone
full
upon
her
once
more
she
was
smiling
once
more
her
head
was
thrown
back
in
amusement
the
attitude
of
the
burglar
was
threatening
his
big
bony
hands
clutched
the
door
frame
of
the
cab
and
his
shoulders
were
rounded
doggedly
laugh
bat
heard
him
say
laugh
all
you
like
but
as
long
as
you
do
the
rest
of
it
i
do
care
so
get
busy
and
i
be
waiting
to
hear
from
you
with
this
he
stepped
back
and
the
girl
signaled
the
driver
the
cab
started
away
and
big
slim
turned
toward
the
door
swiftly
bat
left
it
and
was
back
in
the
room
from
which
he
had
entered
the
hall
dropping
quietly
out
of
the
window
he
crossed
the
courtyard
and
scaled
the
then
once
more
in
his
own
room
he
sat
upon
the
edge
of
the
bed
well
said
he
the
new
one
is
here
i
felt
sure
it
was
coming
but
and
he
gripped
the
edge
of
the
iron
cot
hard
i
never
expected
it
to
be
anything
like
this
chapter
xi
dennison
talks
once
more
by
noon
next
day
bat
scanlon
had
gotten
into
communication
with
the
two
had
lunch
in
the
quiet
depths
of
a
rathskeller
where
they
ate
and
talked
and
afterward
smoked
to
the
drone
of
some
stringed
instruments
scanlon
told
of
his
experiences
of
the
previous
night
and
the
criminologist
listened
with
the
keenest
interest
so
said
he
at
length
our
friend
big
slim
proves
to
be
a
person
of
some
parts
i
must
meet
him
and
the
swiss
here
uttered
a
little
clicking
sound
expressive
of
great
admiration
if
criminal
he
be
he
is
of
the
superlative
sort
as
you
have
just
remarked
when
that
kind
crooked
their
angles
are
of
the
deadliest
it
will
be
my
good
fortune
perhaps
when
meeting
the
burglar
to
encounter
this
gentleman
also
but
nora
questioned
bat
coming
to
the
point
which
was
of
most
interest
to
him
what
of
her
what
about
her
being
in
that
place
bent
his
brows
and
one
well
kept
hand
smoothed
the
shaven
chin
you
say
and
there
was
an
inquiring
glint
in
his
eyes
she
was
rather
on
friendly
terms
with
the
burglar
why
replied
bat
reluctantly
i
would
say
friendly
exactly
she
was
laughing
and
did
seem
very
much
at
her
ease
while
she
talked
to
him
i
admit
that
but
what
of
the
other
things
what
of
the
creeping
across
the
room
with
the
gun
in
her
hand
of
her
listening
at
the
wall
and
what
of
the
look
of
fear
i
saw
on
her
face
when
that
fellow
opened
the
door
for
her
to
go
out
nodded
of
course
said
he
we
must
not
overlook
anything
glancing
at
his
watch
and
apparently
dismissing
this
particular
point
from
his
mind
he
added
it
now
and
i
want
to
run
around
to
the
polo
club
will
you
come
along
scanlon
was
willing
and
so
they
made
their
way
from
the
rathskeller
into
the
sunlight
the
polo
club
occupied
a
magnificent
modern
building
in
a
prominent
location
they
passed
in
at
a
door
which
was
opened
by
a
man
in
uniform
ostentatious
in
its
soberness
at
the
end
of
a
room
rich
in
rugs
and
paintings
they
encountered
another
man
stout
and
impassive
is
dennison
here
do
you
know
hocking
asked
yes
sir
in
the
replied
the
man
impassively
but
with
certainty
in
the
they
came
upon
dennison
purple
of
jowl
with
his
white
fat
hands
folded
across
his
paunch
smoking
a
cigarette
and
looking
out
at
a
window
oh
how
are
you
lifting
his
eyes
but
never
stirring
how
do
scanlon
quite
comfortable
here
of
an
afternoon
said
as
he
dropped
into
a
chair
at
the
other
side
of
the
window
i
had
no
idea
how
could
you
have
complained
dennison
you
drop
in
only
once
or
twice
in
a
year
and
then
only
of
a
night
and
when
old
hungerford
is
in
town
smiled
as
he
thought
of
those
rare
nights
with
hungerford
over
the
chess
board
nights
when
he
matched
himself
against
an
intelligence
almost
mystical
and
out
of
each
contact
with
which
he
emerged
drenched
with
new
understanding
i
suppose
that
so
he
admitted
but
i
should
get
here
oftener
he
looked
interestedly
at
the
other
and
added
get
over
your
little
jolt
of
the
other
night
all
right
i
pretty
shaky
dennison
looked
at
bat
who
had
possessed
himself
of
an
easy
chair
i
do
know
if
scanlon
knows
anything
about
how
doing
or
not
he
giving
me
confounded
little
attention
never
in
it
seems
when
i
get
there
and
one
of
his
understrappers
must
put
me
through
it
all
depends
on
yourself
at
this
point
in
the
race
spoke
scanlon
easily
in
a
week
or
so
be
ready
to
take
you
on
i
be
able
to
see
what
i
doing
then
oh
i
say
i
not
so
beastly
fleshy
as
all
that
protested
dennison
indignantly
do
pay
any
attention
to
him
said
smiling
a
thing
such
as
you
went
through
would
be
likely
to
upset
any
one
of
course
it
would
agreed
dennison
eagerly
tom
burton
and
myself
were
pretty
intimate
and
to
find
out
suddenly
that
he
gone
down
like
that
of
course
it
would
upset
any
one
you
knew
burton
for
a
long
time
did
you
not
so
very
maybe
for
seven
or
eight
years
i
met
him
at
place
one
night
when
he
was
playing
roulette
in
big
luck
that
was
about
a
year
before
he
married
nora
cavanaugh
the
actress
dennison
lighted
a
flat
turkish
cigarette
and
inhaled
a
deep
draught
of
smoke
i
was
kind
of
surprised
to
hear
about
him
being
married
for
he
always
talked
against
that
state
he
said
it
got
a
man
into
a
great
lot
of
trouble
where
was
it
you
saw
him
on
the
night
of
his
taking
off
asked
the
investigator
why
at
danforth
things
were
a
little
dull
as
though
feeling
an
explanation
of
his
presence
in
the
were
necessary
and
i
thought
i
drop
around
and
get
a
little
excitement
out
of
the
game
if
i
could
burton
was
there
and
had
just
been
cleaned
out
he
was
in
an
impatient
sort
of
humor
and
was
damning
things
at
a
tolerable
speed
nothing
vicious
you
know
but
just
enough
to
show
his
ginger
had
you
much
of
a
conversation
with
him
yes
quite
a
long
one
dennison
puffed
at
his
cigarette
quite
pleased
that
he
had
an
interested
audience
for
his
for
the
time
favorite
topic
you
see
when
tom
was
in
hard
luck
he
was
a
great
fellow
for
going
back
and
calling
up
a
lot
of
disagreeable
things
that
had
happened
to
him
maybe
that
does
sound
very
cheerful
but
it
was
so
bad
to
listen
to
burton
had
a
past
that
was
a
bit
different
you
see
while
i
sure
he
was
a
sport
in
all
essential
things
still
he
had
mingled
with
a
lot
of
people
such
as
one
seldom
hears
of
outside
novels
his
comments
upon
his
family
were
also
rather
frequent
usually
if
a
fellow
dislikes
his
family
he
keeps
it
to
himself
but
burton
when
he
was
in
the
dumps
talked
about
it
his
son
frank
who
draws
the
sporting
cartoons
for
the
came
in
for
an
especially
strong
dressing
down
that
night
it
seems
he
makes
a
remarkable
salary
for
he
devilish
clever
i
think
and
yet
when
his
father
was
broke
and
called
on
him
at
odd
times
over
the
telephone
for
a
little
tide
to
carry
him
over
the
bar
he
always
turned
him
down
flat
tom
regarded
this
as
rank
ingratitude
he
was
the
boy
father
he
said
and
was
entitled
to
certain
consideration
and
respect
he
boiled
over
the
thing
and
said
he
meant
to
square
the
account
some
day
burton
as
the
wronged
father
is
funny
observed
scanlon
why
he
have
a
little
quivery
music
and
some
paper
snow
flakes
to
fall
on
him
that
would
have
increased
the
effect
maybe
he
was
altogether
wrong
said
dennison
as
though
feeling
bound
to
defend
his
friend
a
son
has
certain
duties
toward
his
father
i
believe
but
burton
could
expect
much
of
that
sort
of
thing
from
his
children
for
it
seems
they
were
trained
right
you
know
their
mother
must
have
been
a
queer
sort
set
in
her
ways
and
always
complaining
she
had
the
country
school
teacher
idea
of
life
and
what
part
of
it
should
be
lived
and
burton
never
hit
it
with
her
properly
she
brought
up
her
children
with
the
same
views
as
her
own
their
father
was
always
pointed
out
as
the
kind
of
person
they
must
avoid
and
with
that
sort
of
thing
sounded
in
their
ears
continually
of
course
their
attitudes
as
they
became
older
were
to
be
expected
well
from
all
accounts
said
scanlon
they
have
a
pretty
good
argument
on
their
side
neglect
and
all
that
burton
was
your
idea
of
a
family
man
was
he
well
no
not
exactly
confessed
dennison
but
then
i
do
put
myself
up
as
a
judge
of
such
things
however
i
got
a
notion
it
would
be
hard
to
live
with
a
silent
religious
wife
a
son
you
knew
hated
you
and
a
daughter
who
had
er
well
spells
bent
his
head
forward
a
trifle
and
a
look
of
interest
glinted
in
his
keen
eyes
spells
asked
he
what
do
you
mean
dennison
smiled
broadly
that
an
expression
i
got
from
an
old
colored
man
who
used
to
work
for
my
father
years
ago
queer
how
such
things
stick
to
one
is
it
but
i
do
just
know
how
to
describe
what
burton
told
me
about
his
daughter
in
any
other
way
she
was
an
epileptic
that
a
thing
one
goes
down
under
and
case
was
just
the
reverse
she
was
as
a
rule
propped
up
in
a
chair
as
weak
as
a
kitten
but
when
these
things
took
her
she
grew
immensely
strong
and
sort
of
wild
i
see
said
and
scanlon
as
he
watched
saw
him
so
to
speak
store
the
fact
carefully
away
in
his
memory
can
you
remember
anything
else
burton
talked
about
that
night
why
yes
to
be
sure
dennison
looked
at
the
still
figure
of
the
investigator
through
the
light
rifts
of
smoke
you
seem
to
have
a
interest
in
the
matter
he
added
nodded
yes
he
replied
there
is
more
to
it
than
the
police
have
shown
and
i
interested
in
the
son
predicament
nasty
mess
for
him
agreed
dennison
pursing
up
his
thick
lips
terrible
kick
up
that
a
fact
glad
i
not
in
it
he
smoked
for
a
moment
or
two
and
then
proceeded
what
was
on
tom
mind
most
of
all
that
night
was
the
condition
of
his
pocketbook
according
to
his
statement
it
was
pretty
flat
he
come
into
danforth
with
about
fifty
dollars
all
he
had
hoping
for
a
little
luck
at
the
wheel
but
even
that
slipped
away
from
him
did
he
have
anything
in
mind
do
you
know
that
would
get
him
out
of
his
difficulties
i
suggested
that
he
try
his
son
once
more
said
dennison
but
he
did
seem
to
take
kindly
to
the
notion
after
a
while
he
began
to
hint
at
some
little
matter
i
could
quite
get
its
nature
eyes
narrowed
as
dennison
proceeded
and
he
seemed
to
have
some
confidence
in
its
turning
out
well
you
say
you
could
get
its
nature
was
still
regarding
the
man
steadily
am
i
to
take
from
that
that
you
understand
a
part
of
it
dennison
stirred
uneasily
why
yes
he
replied
i
think
i
did
as
i
said
a
while
ago
always
believed
him
to
be
a
sport
who
was
strictly
on
the
level
though
i
admit
there
are
a
lot
of
men
i
know
who
think
just
the
other
way
around
but
though
i
do
believe
it
i
agree
as
i
said
before
been
a
little
different
and
had
mixed
with
a
queer
lot
of
characters
well
from
what
he
dropped
the
matter
he
had
in
hand
that
night
had
one
of
these
people
somewhere
in
the
background
you
got
no
details
not
any
part
of
the
time
he
talked
me
not
me
at
all
he
was
regretting
certain
things
how
he
given
up
opportunities
of
profit
so
as
to
hold
a
place
for
himself
in
the
society
he
moved
in
he
argued
that
if
a
man
could
bet
on
the
turn
of
a
card
or
a
wheel
in
a
place
like
danforth
which
is
an
illegal
establishment
why
could
he
not
do
certain
other
things
which
were
also
merely
illegal
without
losing
caste
he
had
a
habit
of
arguing
this
way
when
he
was
broke
but
i
never
took
him
quite
seriously
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
never
was
sure
as
to
what
he
meant
once
or
twice
i
asked
but
he
always
turned
the
matter
off
and
began
to
talk
about
something
else
he
was
always
close
about
details
or
confidences
in
things
like
that
proceeded
dennison
i
sometimes
thought
this
reticence
is
what
made
the
talk
about
him
but
he
was
very
angry
that
night
he
stormed
up
and
down
and
here
dennison
gestured
with
his
cigarette
with
the
manner
of
one
who
is
determined
to
hold
back
nothing
and
he
did
drop
something
after
a
little
something
i
admit
that
made
me
wonder
what
was
up
have
you
any
objections
to
telling
what
that
was
asked
smoothly
no
of
course
not
dennison
looked
exceedingly
virtuous
if
it
do
any
good
it
ought
to
be
known
i
think
i
told
you
last
time
we
met
that
when
tom
burton
left
me
that
night
he
said
he
was
going
to
see
a
man
on
some
business
something
that
would
bring
a
profit
remember
well
he
did
mention
the
man
name
but
without
realizing
it
right
in
the
middle
of
the
talk
he
let
out
the
nature
of
his
occupation
what
was
that
asked
scanlon
the
man
was
a
burglar
chapter
xii
a
double
shadow
this
was
the
extent
of
dennison
knowledge
except
the
detail
he
called
after
them
as
they
were
leaving
the
room
a
little
later
i
say
he
cried
rising
in
sudden
recollection
do
you
know
any
sort
of
a
place
that
goes
by
the
name
of
no
replied
the
investigator
over
his
shoulder
why
i
think
that
where
burton
was
to
meet
the
party
the
one
i
just
mentioned
you
know
it
just
came
to
me
on
the
street
the
big
athlete
said
to
burton
knew
big
slim
and
had
a
little
job
framed
up
with
him
eh
well
that
knocks
me
over
for
sure
it
odd
said
how
things
seem
to
fall
into
place
scanlon
saw
the
light
of
speculation
in
the
singular
eyes
but
made
no
comment
a
little
later
the
investigator
went
on
that
you
should
have
this
rather
extraordinary
experience
of
yours
with
big
slim
and
now
he
paused
deep
in
thought
and
as
he
did
not
resume
bat
said
nora
knows
this
crook
now
we
find
that
the
bounder
knew
him
too
and
they
both
have
had
dealings
of
some
sort
with
him
but
was
deep
in
thought
and
made
no
reply
they
continued
to
walk
on
the
squares
lengthening
into
miles
on
the
outskirts
he
suddenly
stopped
hello
said
he
looking
about
rather
surprisedly
we
here
are
we
i
thought
i
would
disturb
you
seeing
that
you
seemed
to
be
thrashing
it
out
said
scanlon
the
criminologist
looked
at
his
watch
there
a
subway
station
only
a
little
way
from
here
said
he
get
back
there
one
or
two
things
i
want
to
do
they
boarded
the
train
and
as
they
neared
the
middle
of
the
city
the
investigator
said
i
get
off
at
the
next
station
if
you
do
mind
look
up
big
slim
once
again
and
see
what
more
you
can
learn
from
him
if
there
is
anything
call
me
at
eleven
if
i
not
there
leave
word
where
you
can
be
reached
by
wire
right
said
scanlon
dropped
off
at
the
next
station
and
vanished
in
the
crowd
bat
held
his
place
for
several
stations
further
then
he
too
alighted
walking
a
few
blocks
he
came
to
the
meaner
sections
the
buildings
looked
huddled
and
slovenly
dirty
alleys
ran
between
them
the
smells
were
many
and
offensive
leisurely
he
walked
along
a
street
crowded
with
low
auction
rooms
cheap
variety
places
and
establishments
which
provided
a
curious
medley
of
food
which
a
patron
might
consume
while
he
stood
up
and
listened
to
the
din
of
an
automatic
piano
away
amidst
a
horde
of
other
signs
the
big
athlete
noted
one
bearing
the
swiss
coat
of
arms
friend
bohlmier
hotel
bat
said
to
himself
i
may
as
well
stop
in
and
look
around
maybe
the
slim
one
is
stirring
the
hotel
now
that
he
saw
it
in
daylight
was
rather
neat
looking
outside
the
window
glass
shone
there
was
clean
paint
upon
the
doors
and
other
woodwork
through
the
windows
of
the
office
plants
were
to
be
seen
growing
greenly
in
pots
the
building
was
upon
a
corner
just
around
this
upon
a
rather
more
quiet
street
than
the
main
one
was
the
door
at
which
nora
cab
had
stood
the
night
before
and
as
bat
slowly
took
in
the
sinister
aspects
of
the
neighborhood
he
marveled
at
what
he
had
seen
a
girl
like
nora
coming
alone
to
a
place
like
this
in
the
night
and
in
this
section
of
the
city
he
exclaimed
mentally
it
got
me
winging
i
admit
that
with
careless
manner
he
strolled
into
the
little
sanded
office
the
rhine
castles
in
the
prints
upon
the
wall
still
reared
ruggedly
from
their
hilltops
the
alpine
goatherds
looked
exceedingly
romantic
and
as
they
posed
against
the
backgrounds
of
their
herds
the
place
was
empty
however
and
as
bat
paused
he
heard
a
peculiarly
hard
and
sliding
sound
it
was
not
a
large
sound
indeed
it
was
quite
small
but
there
was
a
slippery
deft
regularity
to
it
which
caused
the
big
athlete
to
catch
and
hold
it
turning
it
over
in
his
mind
to
come
at
its
meaning
but
in
a
few
moments
it
stopped
there
was
a
movement
of
feet
upon
the
sanded
floor
a
chair
was
pushed
back
and
a
bald
head
appeared
above
the
top
of
a
screen
ach
said
the
voice
of
old
bohlmier
it
is
you
yes
replied
bat
as
he
moved
toward
the
screen
just
thought
come
in
and
see
if
my
friend
was
around
not
yet
said
the
swiss
not
yet
he
is
neffer
about
much
till
the
night
dime
eh
chuckling
quaintly
the
head
disappeared
and
scanlon
reached
the
edge
of
the
screen
it
was
a
cozily
secluded
corner
with
a
window
facing
upon
the
inner
courtyard
geraniums
stood
in
painted
pots
on
shelves
across
the
window
a
rack
of
music
was
at
one
side
against
the
wall
was
an
extemporized
bookcase
of
stained
wood
which
held
an
array
of
german
books
worn
but
prim
and
tight
in
their
bindings
on
a
table
lay
a
flat
stone
and
a
small
shining
oil
can
stood
near
it
bohlmier
was
now
seated
a
knife
in
his
hand
a
huge
knife
with
the
blade
ground
and
until
it
had
arrived
at
a
murderous
narrowness
and
he
now
held
it
up
looking
placidly
along
its
glimmering
length
through
his
rimmed
spectacles
no
said
he
and
the
shining
bald
head
wagged
in
a
sort
of
bland
humor
your
friend
does
not
care
much
for
der
day
dimes
and
then
shifting
a
steady
childlike
stare
upon
the
big
man
he
asked
you
haf
nod
known
him
long
is
it
not
very
replied
bat
only
a
short
time
bohlmier
nodded
then
he
laid
the
thin
blade
against
the
stone
upon
the
table
kissing
it
gently
along
its
full
length
of
edge
the
man
breath
seemed
to
hiss
softly
as
the
steel
slipped
across
the
stone
and
as
it
turned
deftly
and
came
back
the
hiss
changed
to
a
blissful
watery
gurgling
thin
and
long
drawn
in
a
prickling
ran
across
scalp
he
had
the
sensation
of
warm
flesh
being
cleverly
and
slowly
laid
open
with
a
blade
which
had
sand
upon
its
edge
illustration
he
lifted
the
blade
once
more
there
was
a
cherubic
smile
upon
the
face
of
the
old
swiss
as
he
lifted
the
blade
once
more
and
ran
his
thumb
down
its
length
hah
he
said
it
is
goot
i
vill
do
no
more
carefully
he
wiped
the
knife
and
stone
with
a
cloth
and
laid
them
aside
after
this
he
polished
his
big
spectacles
and
surveyed
bat
minutely
you
are
a
stranger
in
der
city
i
belief
stated
he
i
do
know
much
about
it
replied
bat
and
for
this
he
eased
his
conscience
with
the
reflection
that
few
men
did
it
a
fine
blace
said
bohlmier
der
gelt
is
plenty
if
a
man
der
nerve
haf
here
a
canary
in
a
small
cage
hung
high
among
the
plants
began
a
long
thrill
liquid
and
full
the
swiss
smiled
with
pleased
surprise
ah
rasgal
admonished
he
shaking
one
fond
finger
is
id
not
asleeb

dis
der

right
away
now
der

as
though
understanding
ceased
its
song
then
the
man
turned
to
bat
once
more
our
friendt
vill
tell
you
some
dings
said
he
he
is
an
enterbrising
man
it
vill
pay
you
to
listen
a
little
later
scanlon
wandered
into
a
large
room
leading
off
from
the
office
the
floor
was
sanded
here
also
between
two
windows
was
a
colored
print
in
which
william
tell
refused
to
salute
the
symbol
of
tyranny
before
a
background
of
alpine
hills
there
were
heavy
benches
along
the
walls
and
some
chairs
scattered
about
with
a
few
bare
but
thoroughly
scrubbed
tables
upon
which
lay
newspapers
the
men
who
sat
and
smoked
or
talked
or
read
in
this
room
were
peculiarly
of
a
kind
their
dress
was
almost
exactly
similar
the
stage
of
wear
being
the
only
difference
each
of
them
smoked
a
cigarette
nervously
each
wore
a
cap
which
came
well
down
to
the
ears
and
shoes
which
humped
up
suddenly
at
the
toes
they
had
the
furtive
manners
which
become
habitual
in
the
shaded
section
of
a
big
city
their
eyes
were
quick
and
cold
and
always
inquiring
bat
took
a
seat
at
a
window
and
also
lighted
a
cigarette
my
is
fair
thought
he
complacently
and
now
with
the
cigarette
going
no
one
would
doubt
that
i
had
been
working
under
cover
for
years
he
read
a
newspaper
and
smoked
for
the
better
part
of
an
hour
the
light
had
dimmed
and
the
old
swiss
had
turned
on
the
gas
then
big
slim
narrow
shouldered
and
stooping
came
into
the
room
with
his
peculiar
slinking
gait
hello
greeted
scanlon
as
he
got
up
i
just
been
wondering
if
i
was
going
to
see
you
was
out
with
a
friend
of
mine
looking
over
some
new
work
said
the
burglar
with
a
grin
you
got
ta
keep
after
business
if
you
expect
to
get
any
of
it
had
anything
to
eat
asked
bat
not
yet
let
go
around
to
joey
loo
the
two
left
the
hotel
and
passed
through
a
tangle
of
narrow
forlorn
looking
streets
then
they
turned
into
a
cellar
opening
with
dirty
wooden
steps
and
a
door
upon
which
was
painted
some
chinese
characters
in
brilliant
red
the
warm
moist
breath
of
oriental
cookery
was
thick
around
them
as
they
sat
down
at
one
of
the
small
tables
and
scanlon
looked
about
some
patrons
of
both
sexes
were
already
there
the
women
were
dejected
or
hard
here
and
there
were
seen
a
few
who
were
merely
vacant
the
men
were
of
the
meagre
pallid
type
nervous
of
action
and
furtive
of
eye
stoical
chinamen
with
feet
carried
food
about
great
chow
in
this
dump
said
big
slim
i
spotted
it
one
night
when
i
was
edging
away
from
a
the
chinks
can
cook
and
that
more
than
you
can
say
of
a
lot
of
the
other
folks
who
take
it
into
their
heads
to
run
eating
places
a
fat
chinaman
with
a
smiling
face
and
a
greasy
blouse
came
up
to
them
and
the
burglar
began
pointing
out
to
bat
the
high
points
of
the
cuisine
when
they
had
given
their
orders
big
slim
rolled
a
cigarette
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
a
newspaper
which
lay
upon
the
table
caught
his
eye
and
he
grinned
derisively
gee
said
he
the
cops
are
the
solidest
chunks
of
ivory
i
ever
seen
some
of
the
things
you
read
about
them
doing
are
screams
what
now
asked
bat
the
gleam
in
the
green
eyes
of
the
other
interesting
him
big
slim
chuckled
and
his
shifty
look
went
from
scanlon
to
the
region
round
about
them
and
then
back
again
there
was
a
fellow
shoved
off
the
other
night
out
in
the
suburbs
maybe
you
saw
something
about
it
well
the
bulls
made
an
awful
mess
of
that
i
never
seen
them
fall
down
so
hard
before
and
believe
me
that
saying
something
that
was
the
burton
case
was
it
i
been
following
it
a
little
said
bat
big
slim
took
a
deep
draught
from
the
cigarette
and
then
flung
it
away
slowly
he
exhaled
the
smoke
and
then
sat
looking
at
his
companion
and
cracking
the
joints
of
his
bony
fingers
that
guy
burton
was
a
slick
one
said
he
admiringly
you
got
ta
hand
him
that
you
knew
him
did
you
said
bat
a
little
he
done
the
swell
mobs
society
people
and
gambling
were
other
things
he
worked
at
and
it
been
whispered
more
than
once
that
he
was
handy
with
a
pen
nice
work
said
bat
but
dangerous
about
the
best
things
he
pulled
were
his
said
big
slim
the
cops
never
got
anything
on
him
and
he
been
fooling
with
the
edge
of
the
law
for
years
his
son
did
not
inherit
any
of
the
talent
for
here
he
is
waiting
on
the
grand
jury
charged
with
pushing
the
old
man
over
the
edge
the
burglar
chuckled
highly
entertained
the
cops
are
a
fine
gang
when
you
start
right
said
he
and
when
they
do
get
a
thing
you
got
to
put
it
where
they
almost
fall
over
it
the
fat
chinaman
brought
the
food
ordered
and
set
it
before
them
with
a
comfortable
air
of
appreciation
good
stated
he
vel
fine
when
he
had
departed
and
they
began
to
test
his
statement
bat
spoke
carelessly
is
it
your
idea
that
young
burton
did
have
a
hand
in
this
thing
big
slim
blew
at
the
steam
ascending
from
a
dish
of
rice
sure
not
said
he
i
seen
that
guy
lots
of
times
he
as
soft
as
mush
you
could
get
him
to
bump
anybody
that
way
on
a
bet
funny
said
bat
who
could
have
done
it
big
slim
shook
his
head
with
the
air
of
one
who
could
talk
eloquently
if
he
would
for
a
time
they
ate
their
food
in
silence
then
the
burglar
resumed
you
know
what
i
told
you
last
night
about
the
phony
fighter
allen
how
i
expected
to
turn
a
trick
that
get
me
a
roll
and
be
able
to
put
it
up
for
him
in
that
match
yes
said
bat
interested
i
been
doing
work
all
over
the
united
states
for
a
good
many
years
stated
the
burglar
and
i
run
into
some
funny
jobs
but
this
one
had
them
all
faded
you
could
start
a
thousand
times
and
never
fall
like
i
did
that
time
tough
bat
nodded
sagely
a
fellow
remembers
those
things
i
remember
that
one
all
right
promised
the
other
do
let
that
worry
you
diamonds
i
think
you
said
the
big
athlete
looked
appreciative
and
labored
with
the
asiatic
cookery
some
of
them
were
as
big
as
that
and
big
slim
grouped
some
grains
of
rice
upon
the
edge
of
his
plate
not
bad
eh
extra
special
replied
the
big
athlete
promptly
diamonds
like
that
are
only
to
be
mentioned
with
great
respect
it
was
one
of
the
easiest
kind
of
tricks
to
turn
said
the
burglar
a
woman
had
but
i
think
i
told
you
that
she
wore
every
night
and
i
framed
the
whole
thing
so
that
it
could
fail
she
lives
up
town
and
gets
home
about
the
same
time
every
night
there
was
a
scaffolding
up
the
side
of
the
house
right
under
her
window
bat
laughed
and
reached
for
a
salt
shaker
with
a
great
assumption
of
carelessness
it
might
have
been
built
for
you
eh
said
he
easy
is
right
i
slipped
up
the
scaffolding
before
she
got
home
said
big
slim
drifting
perhaps
unconsciously
into
the
narrative
and
i
was
outside
when
she
came
into
the
room
she
pulled
down
the
blind
and
then
i
moved
over
right
under
the
window
the
blind
was
all
the
way
down
so
i
laid
fiat
on
the
boards
and
could
see
into
the
room
bat
made
an
indefinite
sort
of
noise
down
in
his
throat
perhaps
the
burglar
fancied
it
indicated
interest
at
any
rate
he
went
on
she
stood
for
a
while
thinking
then
she
begins
to
take
off
the
diamonds
there
was
a
box
there
to
put
them
in
all
open
and
ready
thinks
i
to
myself
they
are
all
gathered
up
nice
and
safe
that
when
i
reach
for
them
then
i
be
sure
to
have
them
all
she
was
still
taking
them
off
out
of
her
hair
from
her
breast
from
around
her
neck
then
suddenly
she
stopped
and
stood
still
as
though
she
heard
something
and
was
listening
and
then
the
door
opens
and
in
walks
a
man
all
smiling
and
smooth
and
takes
off
his
hat
i
see
a
man
she
knows
her
husband
said
big
slim
her
husband
that
she
do
live
with
and
believe
me
she
was
any
way
tickled
to
see
him
i
could
hear
much
but
every
now
and
then
i
got
a
word
or
so
and
was
able
to
string
the
thing
together
he
was
broke
and
wanted
money
she
would
give
up
he
threatened
her
but
she
called
him
strong
then
he
hits
her
and
grabs
the
diamonds
and
was
off
and
you
were
left
said
bat
displaying
a
grin
which
cost
him
some
effort
left
flat
the
lank
burglar
pulled
at
his
fingers
until
the
joints
cracked
he
took
the
whole
right
from
under
my
nose
what
did
you
do
then
asked
bat
for
a
couple
of
seconds
i
hung
fire
said
big
slim
i
had
it
in
my
mind
to
jump
into
the
room
follow
and
lay
him
out
but
a
better
plan
came
to
me
why
not
skim
down
the
scaffold
and
get
the
lad
as
he
left
the
house
with
the
stuff
good
said
bat
that
it
that
what
i
done
said
the
burglar
and
as
i
was
slipping
down
i
framed
it
for
the
guy
i
would
hold
him
up
in
front
of
the
house
there
were
too
many
lights
and
too
many
chances
to
take
i
wait
till
i
got
him
in
a
street
that
was
darker
and
had
more
what
about
the
woman
asked
bat
was
she
hurt
much
no
replied
big
slim
while
i
was
thinking
what
i
do
after
the
fellow
blew
with
the
diamonds
i
was
still
looking
into
the
room
she
held
her
hand
to
her
face
for
a
moment
as
if
it
hurt
her
pretty
bad
then
she
took
it
away
and
here
the
speaker
grinned
widely
well
maybe
it
was
a
good
thing
for
friend
husband
that
he
was
there
just
then
she
a
look
on
her
face
that
was
equal
to
anything
humph
said
bat
i
do
wonder
and
she
did
take
it
all
out
in
looks
said
big
slim
with
the
grin
still
upon
his
cadaverous
face
i
seen
her
burst
right
out
wild
she
pulled
open
a
drawer
and
took
out
something
i
could
see
just
what
it
was
but
i
caught
a
shine
from
it
and
i
bet
my
head
it
was
a
gun
she
put
it
in
her
breast
then
she
grabs
up
her
wraps
and
things
and
tears
out
of
the
room
after
him
bat
stared
at
the
other
a
feeling
of
weakness
creeping
over
him
like
a
shot
when
i
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
scaffold
i
stayed
in
the
shadows
till
he
came
out
when
he
got
a
little
distance
away
i
was
just
going
to
follow
when
the
door
opened
again
and
she
came
out
and
she
dogged
him
said
bat
you
are
sure
of
that
are
you
sure
big
slim
chuckled
as
he
looked
at
bat
his
head
nodding
affirmatively
i
should
say
i
am
it
was
a
double
shadow
there
she
goes
down
the
street
after
him
and
there
i
am
after
her
just
as
nice
as
you
please
chapter
xiii
something
unexpected
the
food
at
joey
loo
lost
its
savor
for
bat
scanlon
he
felt
cold
and
his
mind
was
sodden
a
weight
seemed
to
oppress
his
chest
the
picture
limned
by
the
desperado
was
as
plain
to
him
as
though
it
had
been
done
in
fire
he
saw
the
callous
ruthless
bounder
all
smiles
and
sneers
strike
nora
and
snatch
her
jewels
he
also
saw
the
beautiful
and
creature
her
senses
drowned
in
resentment
snatch
up
a
weapon
and
rush
after
him
all
the
wrong
she
had
ever
suffered
at
his
hands
flaming
up
in
her
mind
and
so
she
followed
him
and
this
hyena
followed
her
was
thought
and
in
the
end
they
all
brought
up
at
stanwick
why
nora
and
big
slim
had
gone
to
the
suburb
was
easy
to
understand
they
had
followed
the
bounder
but
why
had
that
gentleman
gone
there
what
had
taken
him
there
a
place
he
had
never
visited
before
and
so
late
in
the
night
that
he
gone
there
had
been
only
too
tragically
proven
and
the
footprints
found
by
gave
mute
testimony
as
to
the
other
two
and
then
there
was
that
shining
thing
the
burglar
saw
nora
place
in
her
bosom
with
a
sickening
readiness
this
associated
itself
with
the
glittering
little
weapon
which
the
investigator
had
picked
up
on
the
lawn
bat
blundered
on
with
his
food
for
all
these
things
were
huddling
up
in
his
mind
in
a
frantic
mass
and
then
as
if
the
tangle
were
not
already
bad
enough
there
came
the
remembrance
of
the
scene
he
had
observed
through
the
windows
at
bohlmier
hotel
i
do
know
what
that
was
about
any
more
than
the
rest
bat
told
himself
but
there
was
something
between
it
and
the
things
this
fellow
has
just
been
telling
me
if
i
knew
what
they
were
he
looked
at
big
slim
and
found
the
green
eyes
of
the
burglar
regarding
him
curiously
you
do
bat
very
high
in
the
eating
league
do
you
said
the
man
or
maybe
you
ai
crazy
about
the
chink
brand
of
grub
i
kind
of
off
it
said
bat
but
do
let
me
stop
the
good
work
for
you
i
have
a
few
drags
at
a
cigarette
and
we
can
talk
just
the
same
he
waited
for
a
few
moments
hoping
the
desperado
would
resume
where
he
left
off
but
when
big
slim
once
more
began
to
talk
he
did
so
in
a
reflective
vein
removed
from
the
direct
course
of
the
story
things
do
take
funny
twists
said
he
funny
twists
one
minute
you
think
you
got
and
the
next
they
dipping
in
behind
the
scenery
i
noticed
peculiarities
like
that
myself
confessed
bat
the
good
things
i
seen
coming
my
way
would
stock
a
novel
with
incident
but
the
number
that
broke
right
for
me
ai
been
so
many
as
to
cause
me
to
worry
they
have
a
habit
of
heading
off
before
they
get
to
the
plate
just
as
you
say
to
have
a
quart
of
diamonds
all
but
wrapped
up
for
you
and
then
to
miss
them
that
rough
i
should
say
it
was
agreed
bat
but
rather
carelessly
how
did
it
turn
out
did
the
girl
get
back
big
slim
finished
with
the
food
and
pushed
back
his
plate
then
he
took
out
a
tobacco
pouch
and
a
packet
of
papers
and
rolled
himself
a
cigarette
blowing
a
long
stream
of
smoke
into
the
wet
air
of
the
cellar
he
said
i
let
you
in
on
this
a
little
because
i
think
you
a
good
fellow
and
i
wanted
to
show
you
that
i
did
throw
allen
down
cold
see
but
this
job
ai
over
yet
and
i
do
talk
much
about
things
that
done
for
i
seen
too
many
of
them
spilled
that
way
he
took
another
long
draught
of
smoke
down
into
his
lungs
and
exhaled
it
i
figure
on
coming
out
right
on
this
thing
do
you
get
me
but
i
ai
saying
anything
more
bat
weighed
the
matter
carefully
he
saw
a
sort
of
settled
expression
on
the
thin
lips
of
the
burglar
and
this
told
him
there
was
little
to
be
hoped
for
by
questioning
and
i
may
get
him
suspicious
of
me
reflected
the
big
man
it
take
much
to
get
these
phony
guys
putting
their
ears
up
and
listening
for
alarms
and
if
that
once
happens
here
my
chance
is
gone
so
he
said
nothing
more
on
the
subject
though
all
the
time
he
was
burning
to
do
so
the
talk
drifted
into
other
channels
and
in
the
course
of
a
half
hour
big
slim
looking
at
the
clock
said
i
sorry
bo
but
i
have
to
pull
my
freight
i
going
to
see
if
i
ca
put
some
things
right
bat
arose
with
him
a
feeling
of
quick
expectancy
beating
in
his
mind
he
repeated
to
himself
put
some
things
right
well
that
means
only
one
thing
to
me
they
left
joey
loo
together
and
walked
along
the
street
at
almost
any
corner
bat
expected
the
burglar
to
leave
him
but
to
his
surprise
this
did
not
happen
the
man
went
with
him
back
to
the
hotel
in
the
little
office
with
the
sanded
floor
big
slim
said
well
see
you
maybe
bo
bat
waved
a
hand
and
the
cracksman
disappeared
through
a
door
upon
which
was
painted
the
word
private
through
his
inspection
of
the
hotel
inside
and
out
during
the
day
scanlon
had
gotten
a
fair
idea
of
its
plan
that
door
he
told
himself
will
take
him
to
the
rooms
where
i
saw
him
with
bohlmier
and
nora
last
night
it
might
be
just
as
well
at
once
he
was
at
the
desk
and
demanded
his
key
of
a
young
man
who
wore
a
narrow
collar
in
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
he
was
in
his
room
and
had
taken
a
station
at
one
of
the
windows
the
flare
of
light
came
from
below
from
a
single
window
this
time
and
there
sat
bohlmier
in
a
chair
with
big
slim
resting
against
the
table
edge
and
swinging
one
leg
the
burglar
was
explaining
something
very
carefully
and
the
old
swiss
was
listening
his
face
upturned
and
the
gas
light
gleaming
on
his
heavily
rimmed
spectacles
whatever
it
is
said
bat
the
old
party
agrees
without
a
qualm
he
watched
the
two
for
a
space
and
shook
his
head
a
badly
joined
team
as
far
as
looks
go
he
mused
but
if
the
feeling
they
give
me
counts
for
anything
their
work
would
be
as
smooth
as
the
devil
own
old
bohlmier
arose
finally
and
went
to
an
old
chest
that
stood
in
one
corner
throwing
back
the
lid
of
this
he
took
out
one
by
one
a
number
of
tools
and
laid
them
side
by
side
on
the
table
a
cracksman
outfit
murmured
bat
a
feeling
of
disappointment
running
through
him
it
only
big
slim
going
out
on
a
after
all
the
lank
burglar
examined
the
appliances
upon
the
table
and
nodded
his
approval
of
them
after
which
he
stowed
them
away
in
a
small
cloth
bag
then
he
and
bohlmier
prepared
to
go
hello
said
the
big
athlete
the
swiss
is
going
too
his
face
lit
up
with
renewed
interest
it
must
be
more
than
just
a
plain
job
of
burglary
after
all
quietly
he
slipped
from
the
room
and
locked
the
door
and
then
with
a
careless
air
he
left
the
hotel
reaching
the
shadow
of
a
building
across
the
way
he
stood
and
waited
in
a
few
moments
big
slim
and
bohlmier
emerged
at
the
side
door
and
after
a
furtive
look
up
and
down
the
street
they
started
away
after
them
on
the
other
side
went
scanlon
treading
cautiously
so
as
to
make
his
progress
as
soundless
as
possible
and
keeping
well
in
the
overhang
of
the
buildings
he
expected
a
long
journey
in
the
wake
of
the
two
prowlers
but
at
the
end
of
a
half
dozen
blocks
he
was
pleased
to
find
that
this
was
not
to
be
the
case
they
stopped
before
a
sort
of
loft
building
and
in
the
shadow
of
this
held
a
conference
from
the
mouth
of
an
alley
bat
watched
them
then
with
a
feeling
of
consternation
he
saw
they
were
advancing
toward
him
they
spotted
me
was
his
first
thought
but
in
a
moment
he
realized
that
this
could
not
be
so
the
darkness
where
he
stood
was
too
intense
for
them
to
have
made
him
out
a
second
thought
was
illuminating
the
building
beside
which
he
stood
was
to
be
the
scene
of
their
effort
he
shrank
back
into
the
alley
overhead
was
a
tangle
of
dozens
of
windows
some
of
them
broken
and
with
paper
and
old
clothes
stuffed
into
the
openings
looked
down
upon
him
a
burglary
in
such
a
place
as
that
bat
stood
aghast
at
the
idea
what
are
they
after
the
two
men
were
now
at
the
opening
of
the
alley
and
came
cautiously
along
from
the
shadow
of
the
far
wall
bat
watched
them
softly
he
heard
the
voice
of
bohlmier
is
dis
der
door
eh
yes
it
never
locked
in
this
joint
said
the
other
in
an
equally
low
tone
the
halls
are
as
public
as
the
street
the
old
swiss
clicked
his
tongue
against
the
roof
of
his
mouth
to
bick
oud
such
a
place
spoke
he
it
is
not
goot
sense
big
slim
put
his
hand
out
and
bat
heard
a
door
creak
on
its
hinges
now
then
spoke
the
lank
burglar
to
his
companion
in
you
go
and
if
we
meet
any
one
act
as
if
we
lived
here
for
a
dozen
years
the
two
disappeared
and
as
bat
heard
the
door
close
softly
behind
them
he
drew
in
a
long
breath
well
here
goes
said
he
there
will
be
very
little
cover
now
he
knew
if
he
once
allowed
the
burglar
or
his
colleague
to
get
out
of
view
or
hearing
his
chances
of
coming
upon
them
again
were
greatly
lessened
and
yet
too
much
promptness
might
land
him
stumbling
upon
them
spoiling
everything
guardedly
he
turned
the
knob
and
the
door
opened
the
merest
trifle
through
the
chink
he
had
a
clear
view
of
a
dirty
hall
long
and
lighted
by
a
single
incandescent
lamp
quietly
he
stepped
inside
closing
the
door
after
him
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall
was
a
staircase
and
he
went
toward
this
with
padded
feet
the
flight
of
stairs
ran
straight
ahead
at
the
top
was
a
turn
and
a
blank
wall
faced
him
from
somewhere
in
the
hall
above
unseen
by
him
a
brilliant
light
was
burning
and
it
fell
upon
the
flat
space
at
the
top
of
the
steps
unwaveringly
two
grotesque
shadows
lay
upon
the
wall
swollen
and
distorted
and
making
uncouth
gestures
ah
said
bat
still
at
the
bottom
of
the
flight
there
they
are
talking
it
over
as
he
stood
looking
and
listening
he
caught
a
rustling
of
skirts
light
footsteps
and
the
sound
of
a
woman
voice
from
somewhere
in
the
regions
above
in
a
few
moments
this
was
followed
by
a
frightened
squeak
a
chorus
of
startled
and
indignant
voices
and
then
down
the
stairway
upon
him
charged
two
rather
pretty
girls
somewhat
both
chewing
gum
and
talking
shrilly
it
that
big
boob
that
taken
eleven
on
the
third
said
one
he
looks
like
a
scarecrow
what
does
he
mean
by
hanging
around
like
that
frightening
people
i
going
to
go
to
dolan
said
the
other
energetically
a
body
ca
come
through
these
halls
any
more
without
a
then
for
the
first
time
they
caught
sight
of
bat
and
again
the
squeaks
sounded
it
all
right
nodded
the
big
athlete
do
be
afraid
my
goodness
ai
it
awful
cried
one
of
the
young
women
i
be
scared
stiff
all
night
they
scurried
down
the
hall
and
bat
heard
the
street
door
bang
after
them
eleven
on
the
third
scanlon
considered
this
that
must
mean
room
eleven
on
the
third
floor
and
so
a
little
wrinkle
of
wonderment
appearing
between
his
eyes
the
slim
one
has
taken
a
room
here
has
he
he
glanced
up
the
stairs
the
shadows
had
disappeared
from
the
wall
and
he
could
hear
a
scuffling
of
feet
as
of
some
one
moving
upward
they
on
the
next
flight
he
said
so
i
guess
this
one
all
right
to
negotiate
now
quietly
he
ascended
the
stairs
the
hall
on
the
second
floor
was
deserted
overhead
he
could
hear
the
tread
of
the
two
men
as
they
passed
along
so
without
hesitation
he
mounted
to
that
level
as
he
stood
on
the
landing
with
only
a
turn
between
him
and
the
hall
he
heard
a
door
close
all
right
said
he
they
gone
into
their
room
he
rounded
the
turn
and
saw
another
dirty
passage
with
several
naked
incandescent
lamps
lighting
it
a
half
dozen
doors
opened
into
the
hall
but
no
one
was
in
sight
bat
tiptoed
along
until
he
came
to
a
door
which
bore
two
angular
ones
painted
upon
the
panels
a
light
burned
inside
he
saw
that
through
an
open
transom
but
there
were
no
sounds
scanlon
stood
for
a
moment
pondering
what
should
be
his
next
step
if
he
could
raise
himself
somehow
so
that
he
be
able
to
get
a
view
of
the
room
through
the
transom
but
that
would
do
was
the
thought
that
followed
this
likely
to
come
out
at
any
moment
and
nail
me
while
i
peep
instinctively
his
eye
went
about
and
then
came
to
a
stop
at
a
door
directly
opposite
number
eleven
this
was
partly
open
the
room
was
dark
and
as
bat
a
plan
already
forming
in
his
mind
pushed
the
door
slowly
open
not
a
sound
or
stir
greeted
him
good
said
he
to
himself
a
flush
of
exultation
coming
over
him
an
empty
room
this
is
real
luck
he
felt
about
for
a
light
but
stopped
realizing
that
for
his
purpose
darkness
would
be
best
in
his
movements
he
had
knocked
against
a
chair
so
he
now
drew
this
up
with
the
back
resting
against
the
closed
door
and
mounted
it
through
the
two
transoms
he
had
an
excellent
view
of
number
eleven
big
slim
and
bohlmier
stood
with
the
cloth
bag
at
a
table
the
burglar
produced
the
tools
which
they
had
selected
and
spread
them
out
with
much
neatness
of
hand
there
followed
a
short
consultation
held
in
whispers
and
with
their
lips
held
close
to
each
other
ears
then
big
slim
selected
a
couple
of
the
tools
and
approached
the
wall
on
the
right
quickly
the
swiss
rolled
up
a
rug
and
placed
it
on
the
floor
directly
under
the
spot
selected
by
the
burglar
for
his
operations
the
paper
was
peeled
off
in
a
large
circle
about
three
feet
from
the
floor
then
big
slim
attacked
the
plaster
with
a
bit
that
chewed
through
it
rapidly
after
a
hole
had
been
made
large
enough
to
insert
a
short
steel
bar
great
lumps
of
the
plaster
fell
upon
the
rug
beneath
scanlon
marveled
at
the
celerity
of
the
thing
and
while
he
was
doing
so
a
saw
cut
its
way
through
the
lath
beneath
the
plaster
there
was
now
nothing
but
a
thin
layer
of
the
same
substance
between
the
housebreakers
and
the
adjoining
room
in
five
minutes
they
be
there
said
bat
in
perplexity
and
then
what
there
came
a
flare
of
light
behind
him
with
a
subdued
exclamation
he
turned
his
hand
reaching
for
the
big
colt
in
its
holster
beneath
his
coat
but
the
hand
paused
before
it
reached
its
desire
for
there
upon
the
side
of
a
low
cot
sat
a
fellow
shabby
and
down
at
the
heel
he
had
a
lean
jaw
blue
with
an
unshaven
beard
and
in
his
hand
dangling
carelessly
by
the
trigger
guard
was
an
automatic
pistol
well
said
the
gentleman
after
a
pause
with
cool
inquiry
in
his
voice
what
the
idea
do
you
make
a
practice
of
coming
into
people
rooms
building
a
grand
stand
for
yourself
and
taking
observations
across
the
hall
bat
still
standing
upon
the
chair
faced
the
speaker
assuming
a
nonchalance
he
did
not
feel
a
couple
of
friends
of
mine
are
over
there
explained
he
little
joke
on
them
see
did
know
this
room
was
occupied
friends
of
yours
eh
the
man
with
the
lean
jaw
stuck
his
head
forward
and
a
wide
grin
showed
several
black
teeth
you
look
like
a
fairly
respectable
guy
and
to
hear
you
hook
yourself
up
with
a
pair
of
yeggs
is
a
jolt
to
me
then
suddenly
the
speaker
rose
and
tossed
the
pistol
upon
the
bed
in
an
altered
voice
he
continued
suppose
you
get
down
off
that
chair
old
top
and
let
me
have
a
look
at
the
proceedings
as
he
said
this
there
was
a
look
of
amusement
in
his
eyes
something
seemed
to
fall
from
him
which
changed
his
aspect
with
a
gasp
of
wonder
bat
scanlon
leaped
down
and
grasped
his
hand

kirk
by

chapter

visits
headquarters
for
a
moment
bat
scanlon
stood
looking
at
the
disguised
investigator
an
expression
of
almost
incredulity
upon
his
face
i
see
it
you
spoke
he
but
just
the
same
i
feel
like
denying
it
smiled
however
he
made
no
reply
but
stepped
up
on
the
chair
which
scanlon
had
just
vacated
and
looked
through
the
transom
when
he
got
down
there
was
an
amused
look
upon
his
face
your
friend
the
burglar
seems
quite
a
capable
person
said
he
that
hole
he
making
in
the
wall
is
a
very
neat
job
but
and
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
will
have
his
labor
for
his
pains
how
do
you
know
asked
bat
because
i
went
through
the
room
they
are
breaking
into
an
hour
ago
and
the
thing
they
are
looking
for
is
not
there
bat
mopped
his
forehead
well
said
he
i
admit
this
is
all
a
kind
of
a
whirligig
to
me
i
in
it
and
i
losing
none
of
the
motion
but
what
turning
the
thing
is
more
than
i
can
make
out
he
looked
at
what
place
is
this
he
asked
it
a
kept
by
a
dolan
and
it
happened
that
several
lines
of
action
converged
here
but
and
he
took
the
automatic
from
the
bed
where
he
had
thrown
it
and
thrust
it
into
his
pocket
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
done
here
so
we
may
just
as
well
go
while
the
gentlemen
across
the
hall
are
still
absorbed
he
put
on
a
shabby
coat
and
with
a
worn
hat
pulled
well
down
upon
his
head
he
opened
the
door
and
took
a
look
out
into
the
hall
quick
now
said
he
to
scanlon
it
important
that
you
should
not
be
seen
for
your
acquaintance
with
these
people
may
be
valuable
still
bat
slipped
through
the
doorway
and
down
the
hall
and
when
followed
a
few
moments
later
he
found
the
big
man
awaiting
him
in
the
shadows
of
the
alley
where
to
asked
bat
there
is
a
taxi
station
near
here
said
the
investigator
we
need
a
cab
they
walked
through
the
silent
street
and
finally
saw
the
illuminated
sign
of
a
garage
they
got
into
a
cab
saying
police
headquarters
the
taxi
rolled
rapidly
on
its
way
block
after
block
was
passed
bat
endeavored
to
reopen
the
matter
of
his
finding
the
investigator
in
the
house
they
had
just
left
but
did
not
seem
disposed
to
talk
he
sat
in
one
corner
of
the
cab
apparently
deep
in
thought
at
length
they
brought
up
before
the
enormous
pile
in
which
the
police
together
with
other
municipal
departments
had
their
headquarters
their
feet
echoed
hollowly
as
they
walked
through
the
marble
corridor
a
drowsy
elevator
man
ran
them
up
to
the
desired
floor
and
in
a
moment
more
they
were
in
the
department
devoted
to
the
detective
branch
of
the
police
a
man
with
a
face
and
hair
sat
at
a
desk
hello
scanlon
greeted
he
affably
how
are
you
sarge
replied
bat
doing
your
little
night
trick
eh
yes
the
old
man
yawned
a
little
nothing
exciting
in
it
either
has
been
a
thing
stirred
since
i
came
on
then
with
an
indication
of
interest
but
maybe
you
got
something
that
help
keep
us
awake
osborne
said
is
he
here
the
old
headquarters
man
bent
his
brows
at
the
shabby
figure
the
slouch
the
leering
look
the
head
aggressively
thrust
forward
marked
it
plainly
as
of
the
class
against
which
he
had
been
pitted
for
years
yes
he
replied
briefly
we
like
to
see
him
right
through
the
door
said
the
veteran
detective
the
two
passed
through
the
door
indicated
and
saw
the
burly
figure
of
osborne
comfortably
installed
in
an
easy
chair
reading
a
newspaper
hello
said
he
sitting
erect
that
you
scanlon
me
with
a
friend
bat
grinned
highly
entertained
he
wants
to
have
a
little
talk
with
you
i
think
osborne
examined
the
figure
before
him
attentively
leaned
against
the
office
rail
his
hands
in
his
pockets
the
thief
to
the
life
the
detective
examined
him
carefully
but
no
ray
of
recognition
came
into
his
face
then
like
throwing
off
a
garment
allowed
the
mannerisms
he
had
assumed
to
drop
from
him
osborne
at
once
sat
erect
with
a
laugh
of
pleasure
at
his
own
lack
of
penetration
good
said
he
you
almost
fooled
me
he
arose
and
shook
the
criminologist
hand
but
what
the
idea
i
just
been
paying
a
little
visit
replied
he
seated
himself
upon
the
edge
of
a
desk
anything
new
he
asked
not
much
we
still
got
young
burton
of
course
but
he
about
as
a
proposition
as
i
ever
had
anything
to
do
with
he
says
he
is
guilty
but
that
all
he
say
we
given
our
evidence
to
the
district
attorney
office
and
they
pass
it
on
to
the
grand
jury
in
a
few
days
you
still
got
it
in
your
mind
that
he
the
person
you
want
have
you
osborne
crossed
one
leg
over
the
other
and
put
his
thumbs
in
the
armholes
of
his
vest
i
have
acknowledged
he
i
had
a
good
bit
of
experience
in
these
things
and
it
looks
pretty
straight
to
me
we
got
the
motive
all
right
and
it
a
strong
one
i
think
a
good
case
can
be
built
up
around
that
the
candlestick
and
the
testimony
of
the
maid
and
nurse
as
a
matter
of
fact
with
professional
complacence
i
seen
more
than
one
man
go
to
the
chair
with
less
evidence
against
him
but
suppose
there
were
some
other
little
points
to
be
taken
into
consideration
asked
as
i
see
it
you
are
restricting
yourself
to
a
very
narrow
field
the
sort
of
life
the
bounder
led
is
well
known
to
every
one
do
you
suppose
he
was
without
enemies
is
it
not
possible
that
others
may
have
had
motives
for
dealing
the
blow
that
ended
his
life
osborne
nodded
his
head
but
his
comfortable
attitude
did
not
change
sure
said
he
that
so
i
no
doubt
that
tom
burton
in
his
time
a
dozen
that
would
have
been
only
too
glad
of
a
chance
to
him
but
they
did
do
it
no
one
but
the
man
we
got
had
the
chance
that
night
they
were
near
enough
the
investigator
bent
toward
the
speaker
his
eyes
steadily
upon
his
face
how
sure
are
you
of
that
said
he
osborne
took
his
thumbs
from
the
armholes
of
his
vest
i
certain
he
replied
there
was
any
one
around
but
them
we
know
of
and
that
being
the
case
there
could
be
but
stopped
him
just
one
moment
do
you
think
you
are
rather
offhand
in
saying
that
being
the
case
are
you
quite
sure
that
it
is
the
case
osborne
pulled
himself
up
straight
in
his
chair
and
stared
at
the
investigator
bat
scanlon
watching
and
listening
felt
a
little
stir
of
excitement
as
he
realized
what
his
friend
was
about
he
getting
him
worked
up
into
a
state
of
doubt
was
bat
opinion
in
a
minute
he
have
him
so
he
wo
know
what
he
believes
however
there
was
more
than
this
in
the
big
athlete
thoughts
the
way
took
to
bring
doubt
to
the
mind
of
the
headquarters
man
awoke
a
vague
distrust
in
that
of
scanlon
the
question
of
motive
filled
him
with
uneasiness
that
as
to
the
likelihood
of
a
person
other
than
young
burton
being
near
enough
to
strike
the
death
blow
turned
him
cold
and
helpless
you
got
something
on
your
mind
said
osborne
to
the
investigator
he
arose
to
his
feet
and
stood
with
shoulders
squared
and
legs
very
wide
apart
what
it
all
about
from
his
coat
pocket
drew
a
glittering
little
revolver
i
picked
this
up
on
the
lawn
at
no
duncan
street
the
morning
i
went
over
the
place
said
he
quietly
the
big
headquarters
man
almost
snatched
the
weapon
from
his
hand
so
disturbed
was
he
at
this
announcement
with
greedy
eyes
he
inspected
it
smith
wesson
said
he
calibre
five
chambers
all
loaded
he
stood
weighing
the
revolver
in
his
hand
and
looking
at
the
investigator
anything
more
he
asked
i
saw
undoubted
indications
of
a
woman
presence
a
woman
who
had
been
lurking
outside
the
house
and
peering
in
at
the
window
of
the
room
in
which
the
bounder
was
killed
a
woman
quick
excitement
was
in
osborne
face
why
one
of
the
first
things
i
said
when
the
news
came
in
was
he
stopped
a
frown
wrinkled
his
brow
and
he
shook
his
head
indications
are
one
thing
but
proof
is
another
he
said
suppose
it
was
shown
that
a
woman
hanging
around
outside
the
house
that
night
suppose
she
carried
this
gun
what
would
that
get
us
she
was
inside
therefore
she
have
killed
the
bounder
and
then
again
the
man
was
killed
by
a
blow
on
the
head
he
was
shot
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
the
air
of
one
who
had
relieved
himself
of
a
responsibility
i
merely
pointing
out
these
facts
to
you
he
said
of
course
you
can
do
with
them
what
you
like
with
a
nod
to
scanlon
he
was
ready
to
go
osborne
stopped
them
at
the
door
and
asked
a
half
dozen
questions
all
bearing
pointedly
upon
what
the
investigator
had
just
told
him
all
right
said
he
thanks
this
looks
as
though
it
be
of
little
use
but
then
it
does
do
any
harm
to
know
all
you
can
about
a
case
bat
scanlon
heard
the
investigator
chuckle
as
they
got
into
the
waiting
taxi
it
would
be
a
safe
gamble
that
he
will
be
out
at
stanwick
in
the
morning
looking
over
those
places
he
has
neglected
heretofore
laughed
as
the
driver
slammed
the
door
shut
after
them
and
started
toward
the
destination
given
him
bat
anxious
of
eye
and
with
lips
grimly
pressed
together
was
silent
for
a
space
and
then
he
said
what
was
the
idea
of
telling
the
those
things
you
do
give
your
clues
away
as
a
rule
again
laughed
i
do
think
headquarters
will
go
very
far
on
what
indications
they
get
from
the
lawn
at
this
stage
said
he
drily
so
i
do
anticipate
much
interference
from
them
and
with
a
nod
of
the
head
which
told
scanlon
everything
and
nothing
i
have
a
little
theory
which
i
desire
to
try
out
and
i
expect
an
answer
within
hours
chapter
xv
scanlon
states
his
position
it
was
a
fall
sunday
misty
and
with
a
fine
rain
falling
the
mean
street
in
which
house
stood
once
the
street
of
the
aristocracy
but
now
crowded
with
the
hordes
of
east
europe
looked
sodden
and
cheerless
bat
scanlon
as
he
mounted
the
wide
stone
steps
and
rang
the
bell
looked
about
and
philosophized
funny
how
things
have
their
ups
and
downs
men
as
well
as
streets
and
this
is
one
of
my
days
for
being
down
down
at
the
bottom
too
disconsolately
at
the
bottom
with
all
my
vexations
piled
up
on
top
of
me
stumph
grave
of
face
and
altogether
the
very
model
of
opened
the
door
yes
sir
said
he
in
reply
to
scanlon
question
is
at
home
you
are
to
go
up
sir
scanlon
made
his
way
up
the
familiar
staircase
from
the
high
walls
the
rows
of
painted
faces
looked
down
on
him
from
their
dull
gilt
frame
a
fellow
must
feel
a
kind
of
a
pressure
on
him
to
have
an
assorted
gang
of
ancestors
looking
down
on
him
this
way
all
the
time
said
the
big
man
mentally
i
do
know
whether
i
like
it
or
not
stumph
knocked
at
the
study
door
and
when
a
voice
bade
them
come
in
he
opened
it
and
stood
aside
while
scanlon
entered
sat
upon
a
deep
sofa
with
his
legs
wrapped
in
a
smoking
a
briar
pipe
and
going
over
some
closely
typed
pages
how
are
you
greeted
he
take
a
comfortable
chair
will
you
find
things
to
smoke
on
the
table
and
pardon
me
a
moment
while
i
finish
this
scanlon
lighted
a
cigarette
and
sat
down
the
criminologist
plunged
once
more
into
the
typed
sheets
and
while
he
was
so
engaged
bat
eyes
roved
about
the
room
through
the
partly
open
door
at
one
end
he
had
a
detail
of
the
laboratory
with
its
shining
retorts
and
racks
of
gleaming
apparatus
in
the
study
itself
were
rows
of
books
standing
upon
everything
that
would
hold
them
cases
were
stuffed
with
them
they
littered
the
tables
and
stands
some
spotless
in
their
fresh
newness
others
dingy
and
old
with
warping
leather
backs
and
yellowed
pages
put
the
sheets
down
at
last
and
sat
for
a
space
smoking
in
thoughtful
silence
the
singular
eyes
half
closed
then
he
threw
aside
the
rug
and
arose
pressing
a
call
button
he
began
pacing
the
room
this
little
case
of
ours
is
gaining
in
interest
said
he
its
scope
is
widening
too
i
put
one
of
my
men
burgess
on
a
detail
which
i
wanted
thoroughly
searched
and
it
led
him
to
new
orleans
scanlon
elevated
his
brows
no
said
he
is
that
a
fact
there
were
a
number
of
newspapers
scattered
about
the
floor
kicked
one
of
them
out
of
the
way
as
he
turned
the
table
in
his
pacing
i
suppose
you
seen
the
afternoon
editions
said
he
with
a
smile
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
not
yet
said
scanlon
it
a
bit
early
i
had
stumph
get
me
some
of
them
said
the
investigator
and
just
as
i
expected
it
would
be
my
plan
of
last
night
worked
perfectly
you
mean
what
you
gave
osborne
at
headquarters
yes
one
of
the
first
things
he
did
was
to
call
in
the
reporters
and
tell
them
of
the
new
clues
he
neglected
to
state
evidently
by
whom
they
had
been
found
and
the
reporters
naturally
took
it
for
granted
that
he
was
the
person
of
course
criticized
bat
that
the
regular
way
for
to
work
they
grab
off
everything
they
can
listen
to
this
took
up
one
of
the
newspapers
and
turned
to
the
first
page
the
read
to
stanwick
puzzle
a
woman
figures
in
murder
of
burton
work
by
city
finds
evidence
overlooked
by
stuff
of
that
kind
is
like
steam
coal
to
a
boiler
spoke
scanlon
it
keep
the
reporters
going
for
days
the
body
of
the
article
is
shot
full
of
fanciful
matter
said
the
investigator
as
he
tossed
the
paper
aside
it
must
have
been
a
youth
of
considerable
imagination
who
wrote
it
the
casual
reader
would
take
from
his
printed
remarks
that
the
city
authorities
have
the
woman
who
made
the
footprints
directly
under
their
eyes
that
only
an
order
is
necessary
and
she
be
taken
into
custody
scanlon
looked
at
the
graying
end
of
the
cigarette
with
uneasy
eyes
he
shifted
in
the
big
chair
and
crossed
one
leg
over
another
that
fellow
osborne
never
find
out
anything
unless
some
one
tells
him
said
the
big
athlete
and
no
one
going
to
do
that
not
yet
anyway
eh
there
came
a
knock
upon
the
door
come
in
called
a
short
man
entered
he
had
big
shoulders
and
remarkable
girth
of
chest
and
he
carried
a
black
hard
hat
in
his
hand
sit
down
burgess
requested
the
investigator
the
man
with
the
bulging
chest
nodded
to
scanlon
and
took
a
seat
upon
the
edge
of
the
sofa
i
just
been
going
over
that
report
of
yours
went
on
you
have
done
very
well
and
i
thank
you
burgess
fingered
the
rim
of
the
black
hat
and
seemed
gratified
i
never
saw
a
job
develop
so
said
he
did
look
like
much
at
first
but
it
was
all
over
the
place
in
a
day
or
two
i
had
to
jump
clean
to
cleveland
almost
at
once
i
guess
fuller
told
you
and
as
the
investigator
nodded
the
man
proceeded
i
squeezed
cleveland
dry
and
followed
the
lead
to
milwaukee
then
to
nashville
and
finally
to
new
orleans
i
got
most
of
my
leads
in
cleveland
she
was
married
there
and
quite
a
lot
of
people
knew
her
picked
up
the
typed
sheets
and
glanced
through
them
as
though
to
refresh
his
memory
they
seem
to
speak
very
highly
of
her
said
he
could
be
better
replied
burgess
but
there
was
one
little
drawback
there
was
any
of
them
that
knew
her
very
well
except
professionally
and
to
know
a
person
only
professionally
is
no
guarantee
that
you
know
the
facts
about
her
very
true
said
his
eyes
were
still
going
over
the
sheets
you
say
here
that
parslow
was
rather
negative
concerning
her
yes
you
see
she
was
with
him
for
some
time
and
once
when
he
could
do
very
well
without
her
she
told
him
she
have
to
have
more
money
a
thing
like
that
and
burgess
smiled
and
nodded
sometimes
makes
them
shy
of
the
good
word
the
man
nursed
his
knee
the
hard
hat
still
in
his
hands
i
went
to
see
parslow
at
his
office
he
been
manager
of
that
theatre
for
fifteen
years
and
made
it
pay
after
every
one
else
had
failed
kind
of
a
tight
old
wax
i
say
i
could
get
much
out
of
him
at
first
but
later
he
talked
plenty
he
would
say
anything
against
her
but
he
did
praise
her
much
at
nashville
you
had
more
success
oh
yes
a
good
bit
more
she
been
there
a
season
after
leaving
cleveland
there
is
a
thatcher
who
keeps
a
who
let
me
in
on
some
inside
stuff
you
seen
it
all
in
the
report
i
suppose
the
lead
that
took
me
to
new
orleans
was
a
promising
one
but
it
turn
out
as
well
as
i
expected
but
i
got
some
information
at
that
once
more
pressed
one
of
his
call
bells
and
then
turning
to
burgess
he
said
what
you
have
learned
will
be
of
real
service
it
always
well
i
think
to
have
a
background
for
a
case
like
this
the
bare
facts
concerning
the
crime
itself
are
not
always
quite
satisfactory
here
stumph
entered
the
study
and
the
investigator
spoke
to
him
bring
me
volume
iv
and
at
once
please
after
the
servant
had
left
the
room
went
on
with
his
remarks
to
burgess
bat
scanlon
sat
quietly
listening
there
was
something
forlorn
and
sunken
in
the
way
his
big
frame
rested
in
the
padded
chair
and
the
expression
on
his
face
was
one
of
almost
despair
in
a
few
moments
stumph
appeared
bearing
a
huge
book
this
he
laid
upon
the
table
and
at
once
began
to
turn
the
pages
filled
with
writing
in
a
copper
plate
hand
and
ruled
with
great
precision
i
had
intended
to
put
fuller
on
this
said
he
as
he
scanned
the
entries
but
he
still
deep
in
something
else
burgess
half
arose
and
looked
at
the
open
pages
and
as
he
settled
back
on
the
sofa
he
nodded
yes
he
clever
at
that
but
i
guess
we
can
go
through
with
it
and
not
bother
him
put
down
these
names
said
burgess
at
once
produced
a
and
a
pencil
cato
jones
read
the
investigator
i
know
him
said
burgess
as
he
jotted
down
the
name
a
mulatto
who
keeps
an
antique
shop
in
farson
street
judah
rosen
he
likely
commented
burgess
i
saw
a
record
of
him
once
as
written
up
by
the
manchester
police
they
made
it
so
hot
for
him
in
england
he
had
to
jump
out
the
criminologist
read
out
a
number
of
additional
names
then
burgess
closed
his
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
took
a
folded
paper
from
a
drawer
and
handed
it
to
him
here
are
your
instructions
work
carefully
and
whatever
you
do
let
any
inkling
of
what
you
are
after
get
out
burgess
glanced
at
the
document
contents
and
at
one
point
his
mouth
puckered
up
as
though
he
were
going
to
whistle
all
right
said
he
as
he
refolded
the
paper
and
put
it
also
in
his
pocket
anything
more
not
now
but
keep
in
touch
burgess
promised
to
do
so
and
with
a
nod
to
and
one
to
scanlon
he
left
the
room
burgess
has
the
natural
tact
of
fuller
said
as
he
threw
himself
once
more
upon
the
sofa
and
began
recharging
the
briar
pipe
but
he
has
done
amazingly
well
at
times
he
has
a
pushing
way
about
him
and
seems
to
do
things
by
sheer
pressure
in
which
a
more
pointed
intelligence
would
fail
he
lit
the
pipe
and
rearranged
the
rugs
comfortably
about
his
legs
then
with
a
contented
sigh
he
lay
back
and
looked
at
scanlon
well
we
seem
to
be
doing
fairly
eh
said
he
i
rather
think
that
before
long
we
make
an
end
of
this
affair
bat
crushed
the
fire
from
the
end
of
his
third
cigarette
against
the
side
of
a
pewter
bowl
upon
the
table
then
leaning
toward
the
investigator
his
hands
upon
his
knees
he
said
i
want
to
let
you
in
on
something
i
think
you
ought
to
know
this
whole
matter
has
come
to
a
point
where
it
best
for
me
to
declare
my
intentions
before
very
long
i
can
see
myself
taking
a
stand
and
when
i
do
i
do
want
you
to
be
surprised
looked
at
him
inquiringly
but
said
nothing
and
to
explain
just
what
is
behind
this
possible
stand
proceeded
scanlon
i
have
to
tell
you
something
i
never
told
a
soul
before
there
was
a
direct
bluntness
in
the
voice
and
the
manner
of
the
big
athlete
which
men
who
are
naturally
diffident
assume
when
they
approach
certain
subjects
about
eight
years
ago
went
on
bat
i
went
broke
on
a
wrestling
tournament
in
and
right
away
i
had
to
look
around
for
something
to
run
the
wolf
off
the
property
in
oakland
there
was
a
theatrical
manager
who
had
nerve
enough
to
do
shakespeare
and
he
was
rehearsing
you
like
it
a
friend
of
mine
tipped
me
off
that
there
was
a
work
for
me
if
i
went
after
it
and
go
after
it
i
did
acting
was
new
to
me
and
it
had
my
nerve
a
little
but
the
director
told
me
not
to
bother
for
i
could
leave
that
all
to
the
regular
company
my
work
was
to
rehearse
the
leading
man
in
a
little
wrestling
bout
and
then
go
through
it
with
him
in
the
show
laughed
and
so
said
he
you
are
another
of
the
many
who
have
sweated
their
way
through
the
rôle
of
the
wrestler
that
was
me
replied
bat
but
i
did
sweat
much
the
leading
man
was
a
kind
of
a
actor
and
i
had
to
keep
at
low
pressure
all
the
time
so
as
not
to
wear
him
out
but
what
i
did
as
an
actor
got
much
to
do
with
what
i
want
to
tell
you
the
big
thing
is
that
the
rosalind
of
that
production
was
nora
cavanaugh
and
it
was
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
her
ah
said
you
knew
her
as
far
back
as
that
did
you
that
interesting
she
was
the
finest
thing
i
ever
looked
at
said
bat
scanlon
and
not
only
that
but
she
rang
with
the
right
sound
i
was
never
what
you
would
call
a
woman
man
and
so
i
never
got
to
knowing
much
about
them
but
in
the
week
i
was
in
that
oakland
theatre
i
took
a
new
course
and
though
she
never
knew
it
nora
was
the
teacher
you
did
fall
in
love
with
her
said
the
investigator
through
a
haze
of
pipe
smoke
i
did
replied
the
big
athlete
i
fell
for
her
as
a
man
falls
off
a
steeple
there
was
never
a
chance
for
me
even
if
i
looked
for
one
which
i
never
did
that
a
novelty
said
i
never
have
thought
of
you
in
that
way
bat
i
never
have
thought
it
of
myself
only
it
was
kept
pretty
bright
in
my
mind
said
scanlon
we
got
to
be
good
friends
but
i
had
to
jump
away
south
when
i
got
back
nora
was
in
denver
playing
a
season
i
did
see
her
for
a
year
and
by
that
time
she
got
her
head
full
of
being
a
big
star
in
the
east
and
so
as
i
had
nothing
of
value
to
dim
this
idea
why
i
pulled
out
without
her
ever
knowing
just
how
i
was
feeling
in
another
year
she
was
married
to
burton
and
i
was
down
for
the
full
count
too
bad
said
rather
more
absently
than
should
have
been
the
case
too
bad
and
that
what
i
mean
said
bat
scanlon
when
i
say
that
i
may
declare
myself
before
long
i
wo
if
i
can
help
it
but
if
certain
things
come
to
pass
well
there
nothing
else
to
be
expected
of
course
not
said
the
investigator
you
are
quite
right
but
let
us
hope
that
everything
will
come
out
all
right
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
then
arose
briskly
from
the
sofa
i
almost
forgotten
he
said
my
plan
was
to
visit
young
burton
will
you
come
along
the
idea
appealed
to
scanlon
he
had
seen
the
young
artist
only
once
and
that
once
had
left
its
impress
on
his
mind
sure
said
he
there
nothing
i
like
better
than
a
chance
to
hear
and
see
that
young
fellow
again
summoned
stumph
and
said
tell
dixon
to
bring
around
the
car
at
once
ten
minutes
later
attired
in
a
long
coat
he
walked
at
scanlon
side
down
the
steps
to
the
waiting
car
perhaps
said
the
investigator
it
would
have
been
a
trifle
better
if
i
had
made
this
visit
a
day
or
two
ago
as
i
had
intended
but
i
had
a
reason
for
not
doing
so
the
door
of
the
car
closed
upon
them
and
as
they
whirled
away
through
the
fine
rain
went
on
last
night
i
told
you
i
was
trying
a
little
experiment
well
and
there
was
a
look
of
eagerness
in
the
keen
eyes
i
hope
to
get
a
result
what
sort
of
a
result
asked
scanlon
oh
that
i
do
know
wait
and
we
shall
see
chapter
xvi
confessed
the
sombre
battlemented
walls
of
the
jail
looked
grim
and
merciless
through
the
gray
of
the
day
to
scanlon
they
seemed
of
appalling
thickness
and
hardness
the
turrets
which
occurred
at
regular
intervals
he
knew
held
men
armed
and
sleepless
who
watched
tirelessly
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
dingy
souls
drooped
inside
guilt
hung
over
the
whole
place
like
a
palpable
thing
crime
will
never
be
cured
by
placing
criminals
in
institutions
like
this
said
as
they
waited
at
the
gate
instead
it
breeds
here
are
a
race
of
themselves
as
a
rule
they
are
bullies
and
grafters
and
men
placed
for
terms
of
years
at
the
mercy
of
these
ca
be
expected
to
grow
except
toward
the
shadows
a
youth
who
because
of
idleness
impulse
or
dissipation
offends
society
in
some
way
is
thrown
into
this
pit
of
moral
filth
to
cleanse
himself
very
few
men
have
the
fibre
of
the
true
criminal
and
when
a
casual
lawbreaker
sees
this
dreadful
blow
leveled
at
his
soul
he
is
at
first
bewildered
and
afraid
then
if
he
has
any
spleen
he
arrays
himself
against
the
force
which
struck
the
blow
and
so
society
has
gained
another
enemy
they
were
admitted
by
a
uniformed
guard
and
in
a
few
moments
were
in
the
office
a
man
in
a
formal
frock
coat
of
a
decade
ago
greeted
warmly
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
said
he
as
they
shook
hands
i
doubt
if
you
have
been
here
since
that
forgery
case
of
hamilton
durbon
old
clark
had
reason
to
be
thankful
for
your
visit
that
day
sir
for
it
saved
him
a
long
term
of
undeserved
imprisonment
smiled
it
was
rather
a
simple
matter
and
took
only
a
few
minutes
to
demonstrate
said
he
the
firm
was
struck
by
panic
and
frightened
people
usually
want
a
victim
if
this
had
not
been
so
in
their
case
if
they
had
used
the
ordinary
intelligence
of
the
day
work
they
would
have
seen
the
truth
themselves
here
presented
scanlon
to
the
warden
the
latter
put
on
his
and
bowed
with
courtesy
we
should
like
to
see
frank
burton
the
young
man
accused
of
murdering
his
father
said
the
investigator
after
a
little
ah
yes
the
warden
nodded
sadly
that
is
a
very
dreadful
case
i
am
told
there
is
little
doubt
he
is
guilty
and
a
very
prepossessing
boy
it
is
a
great
pity
he
went
to
the
other
side
of
the
office
to
ring
a
bell
and
bat
took
the
opportunity
to
say
what
name
did
you
give
him
eastabrook
you
may
have
heard
of
him
he
has
written
books
on
penology
and
goes
about
lecturing
on
prison
conditions
scanlon
looked
dubious
i
hope
it
wo
depend
on
his
said
he
he
do
sound
like
a
heavyweight
to
me
he
as
easily
deceived
as
a
child
and
i
rather
think
that
is
why
he
is
here
his
great
obsession
is
loyalty
every
guard
in
the
place
may
be
a
grafter
and
a
rascal
but
as
long
as
there
is
an
effusive
display
of
loyalty
to
him
his
eyes
are
closed
one
honest
man
of
his
type
is
more
of
a
clog
to
reform
than
all
the
scoundrels
combined
here
the
old
warden
returned
at
the
same
time
a
guard
entered
the
office
healey
will
show
you
the
way
as
he
shook
hands
with
the
investigator
and
i
trust
your
interest
in
this
unfortunate
young
man
will
have
happy
results
he
also
shook
scanlon
hand
and
expressed
much
gratification
at
having
met
him
then
the
two
followed
the
guard
out
into
the
courtyard
and
into
the
gloomy
corridors
of
the
jail
there
was
a
stale
confined
smell
in
the
place
a
chill
was
in
the
air
the
sort
of
thing
that
comes
from
continued
damp
the
blank
steel
doors
with
their
rows
of
rivet
heads
and
the
criminal
history
of
the
cell
inhabitant
hanging
beside
them
on
a
neat
card
oppressed
bat
there
is
a
movement
on
foot
to
do
away
with
capital
punishment
said
he
to
what
makes
them
think
life
imprisonment
is
as
bad
the
investigator
shrugged
his
shoulders
they
think
that
said
he
they
merely
present
the
indisputable
fact
that
a
legal
murder
can
not
in
any
way
make
amends
for
an
illegal
one
when
that
is
acted
upon
i
of
the
opinion
that
the
jailing
of
men
will
get
more
attention
the
guard
was
a
man
who
walked
with
a
limp
he
had
overheard
these
remarks
and
now
spoke
we
hear
lots
of
things
like
that
said
he
resentfully
people
come
here
in
gangs
sometimes
and
talk
their
heads
off
pitying
men
who
can
be
handled
only
when
they
locked
up
if
sheep
could
talk
they
say
things
just
like
these
people
and
these
people
if
the
criminals
were
jailed
would
be
just
as
helpless
among
them
as
the
sheep
bat
scanlon
looked
somewhat
impressed
you
said
something
said
he
with
a
shake
of
the
head
but
you
have
said
it
all
there
was
a
woman
here
this
morning
said
the
guard
was
also
in
to
see
this
fellow
burton
as
an
afterthought
and
she
talked
that
stuff
too
came
to
see
burton
did
she
looked
interested
who
was
she
some
kind
of
a
relative
i
think
it
was
miss
cavanaugh
the
actress
just
then
they
came
to
a
cell
before
which
the
guard
stopped
here
you
are
said
he
this
is
the
man
you
want
there
was
a
shooting
of
bolts
and
the
pressure
of
an
opening
door
the
inner
door
was
of
close
bars
they
saw
a
narrow
cell
with
unrelieved
walls
and
a
grated
opening
through
which
came
a
small
trickle
of
daylight
a
figure
arose
from
the
cot
at
the
far
end
and
stood
looking
uncertainly
at
the
doorway
want
to
go
inside
asked
the
guard
the
warden
said
it
be
all
right
thanks
said
if
you
please
the
barred
door
was
unlocked
and
opened
the
two
entered
and
stood
face
to
face
with
young
burton
how
are
you
said
scanlon
holding
out
a
ready
hand
remember
me
i
saw
you
at
your
place
at
stanwick
one
day
the
day
i
was
arrested
said
the
young
man
i
remember
you
scanlon
waved
the
hand
which
the
other
had
neglected
to
take
toward
his
friend
this
is
you
may
have
heard
of
him
he
interested
in
this
case
the
young
artist
made
a
weary
gesture
that
can
be
said
of
a
great
many
people
he
said
his
face
was
white
and
had
a
harassed
look
his
eyes
shone
feverishly
i
have
been
to
speak
frankly
plagued
to
death
by
their
interest
it
is
a
pleasant
thing
to
feel
that
almost
every
one
is
consumed
with
the
desire
to
place
a
brand
of
some
sort
upon
a
fellow
creature
regarded
him
without
resentment
i
understand
the
feeling
i
think
said
he
quietly
it
comes
from
the
shock
of
the
charge
laid
against
you
and
the
depression
of
the
jail
but
consider
this
and
the
singular
eyes
held
the
young
man
steadily
if
the
truth
is
to
come
out
in
this
matter
interest
must
be
taken
by
some
one
if
you
are
to
be
freed
of
this
charge
it
will
be
very
likely
by
placing
the
weight
of
it
upon
some
one
else
a
look
of
despair
was
in
the
hot
eyes
of
the
prisoner
his
hands
clenched
tightly
all
his
life
he
said
as
though
speaking
to
himself
all
his
life
he
did
evil
and
now
that
he
is
dead
the
evil
continues
he
pointed
to
a
bench
at
one
side
and
added
will
you
sit
down
the
two
having
seated
themselves
he
sank
down
weakly
upon
the
edge
of
the
cot
i
been
in
poor
shape
since
i
came
here
said
he
i
ca
sleep
and
my
nerves
are
gone
that
bad
said
bat
scanlon
nothing
wears
a
man
out
like
loss
of
sleep
try
to
quit
thinking
of
this
affair
if
you
do
quit
thinking
of
it
young
burton
laughed
in
a
high
pitched
fashion
that
was
very
disagreeable
to
hear
quit
it
you
might
as
well
ask
me
to
stop
the
sun
from
coming
up
i
could
do
it
just
as
easily
there
was
a
short
silence
young
burton
picked
at
the
coverings
of
his
bed
with
nervous
fingers
and
then
he
resumed
they
say
that
any
good
thing
brought
into
the
world
remains
that
good
can
never
be
destroyed
i
wonder
if
the
same
can
not
be
said
of
evil
he
is
dead
and
yet
what
he
did
is
living
after
him
that
is
probably
one
of
the
things
that
will
oppress
mankind
forever
the
persistence
of
evil
is
the
thought
behind
many
ancient
religions
indeed
one
might
include
modern
creeds
as
well
added
for
christianity
teaches
that
evil
clings
from
generation
to
generation
from
age
to
age
i
recall
first
as
a
man
whom
i
felt
to
be
a
stranger
but
whom
i
was
told
to
call
father
said
young
burton
he
did
not
live
with
us
only
appealing
now
and
then
and
making
my
mother
very
unhappy
even
then
small
boy
as
i
was
i
hated
him
and
i
know
he
detested
me
the
young
man
was
in
that
queerly
relaxing
state
which
causes
men
to
tell
their
private
griefs
to
even
casual
acquaintances
very
often
he
went
on
we
were
rather
happy
but
that
was
always
when
my
father
was
away
i
remember
a
little
white
house
on
the
outskirts
where
we
lived
unmolested
for
several
years
my
sister
was
at
school
i
was
employed
by
an
old
wood
engraver
one
of
the
last
of
his
kind
my
mother
earned
a
good
living
and
we
were
quite
comfortable
and
happy
my
father
had
been
away
for
so
long
that
i
had
almost
forgotten
him
when
a
thought
of
him
did
come
into
my
mind
it
was
as
of
an
old
trouble
and
one
that
would
never
come
again
but
one
evening
when
i
reached
home
i
found
him
there
my
mother
face
was
white
and
she
was
trembling
but
he
was
smiling
i
would
rather
and
young
burton
raised
a
shaking
hand
have
heard
another
man
curse
than
see
him
smile
i
know
the
feeling
said
bat
scanlon
i
felt
something
like
it
myself
he
wanted
money
proceeded
the
young
artist
i
knew
my
mother
had
a
little
store
somewhere
which
she
had
put
away
for
the
winter
was
coming
on
he
was
cunning
and
must
have
divined
this
it
was
the
kind
of
thing
she
would
do
when
she
refused
he
smiled
and
insisted
and
finally
the
smile
still
on
his
mouth
remember
he
struck
her
i
had
been
silent
until
that
but
when
i
saw
the
blow
fall
i
became
a
maddened
young
animal
i
flew
at
him
blindly
and
he
beat
me
like
a
dog
a
half
hour
later
he
went
away
and
with
him
went
what
money
my
mother
had
saved
bad
said
bat
scanlon
very
bad
and
now
said
the
young
man
he
dead
but
the
evil
which
his
life
brought
into
the
world
still
lives
oddly
his
mind
seemed
to
cling
to
this
thought
his
eyes
looking
straight
ahead
were
filled
with
apprehension
his
fingers
picked
nervously
at
the
edge
of
a
blanket
evil
is
fear
and
fear
can
be
conquered
said
quietly
if
a
man
wills
it
he
can
stamp
it
out
evil
is
fear
the
prisoner
looked
at
in
sudden
inquiry
in
what
way
in
every
way
replied
the
investigator
no
matter
what
its
form
evil
has
its
base
in
fear
and
it
is
one
of
the
plain
offices
of
man
to
destroy
this
monster
which
has
ridden
him
from
the
beginning
for
when
the
race
was
young
the
world
was
filled
with
unnamed
dread
the
darkness
was
peopled
with
unseen
things
from
this
fear
sprang
superstition
the
future
held
the
first
men
cowed
the
past
had
left
the
marks
of
trials
and
the
memory
of
pain
and
the
fear
of
life
has
since
made
more
criminals
than
perhaps
any
other
thing
while
dread
of
repeating
the
past
has
broken
countless
lives
paused
for
a
moment
his
eyes
still
fixed
upon
the
young
man
then
he
went
on
this
evil
which
oppresses
you
so
has
its
roots
in
a
fear
has
it
not
again
there
was
a
pause
the
prisoner
eyes
met
those
of
the
investigator
fixedly
do
allow
it
to
crush
you
you
are
in
deadly
danger
you
need
your
mind
to
save
yourself
he
arose
and
stood
before
the
other
one
hand
went
out
and
touched
the
prisoner
shoulder
i
have
brought
you
news
new
clues
have
been
found
before
this
the
police
have
worked
only
along
lines
which
led
to
you
now
they
gone
off
on
another
track
there
is
a
woman
in
the
case
and
he
patted
the
drooping
shoulder
and
they
hope
to
fasten
the
crime
upon
her
young
burton
came
to
his
feet
with
a
jerk
a
woman
he
cried
they
are
crazy
a
woman
once
more
he
uttered
the
high
pitched
laugh
which
had
affected
bat
so
disagreeably
what
can
they
be
thinking
of
he
stared
with
excited
eyes
at
the
investigator
then
at
scanlon
then
back
again
to
i
will
not
allow
it
he
cried
do
you
hear
i
not
allow
it
no
woman
did
this
thing
tell
them
i
said
so
i
will
not
permit
an
innocent
person
to
be
blamed
i
did
it
i
did
it
alone
chapter
xvii
the
waters
are
troubled
the
vast
machinery
used
in
gathering
the
news
makes
it
possible
for
an
event
only
an
hour
or
two
old
to
gain
a
place
in
the
types
and
proclaim
itself
to
the
public
and
only
a
short
time
after
frank
burton
made
his
confession
of
guilt
in
his
cell
in
the
county
prison
the
newsboys
were
crying
the
fact
in
the
street
and
scanlon
had
finished
with
their
lunch
at
claghorn
at
the
cigar
counter
in
the
lobby
they
paused
while
they
selected
their
favorite
brands
how
are
you
said
a
familiar
voice
and
looking
up
they
saw
osborne
big
smiling
and
serene
nasty
day
he
proceeded
shaking
some
raindrops
from
the
rim
of
his
hat
i
suppose
you
heard
the
news
carefully
lighted
the
tip
of
a
blunt
cigar
what
news
he
asked
the
heavy
shoulders
of
the
headquarters
man
twitched
with
pleasure
he
saw
in
this
answer
the
evasion
of
a
defeated
man
why
said
he
with
an
effort
to
keep
the
triumph
out
of
his
voice
the
confession
of
frank
burton
oh
that
the
investigator
elevated
his
brows
yes
we
heard
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
confession
was
made
in
the
first
place
to
scanlon
and
me
the
elation
died
slowly
in
the
broad
face
of
osborne
however
that
he
still
felt
his
sagacity
to
be
of
a
superior
quality
was
plain
so
he
said
with
a
carelessness
calculated
to
discount
the
point
gained
by
the
other
oh
that
so
had
heard
of
it
well
and
he
laughed
that
makes
it
all
the
better
you
know
it
true
it
so
all
right
said
scanlon
he
told
it
to
us
and
afterward
to
the
warden
and
a
half
dozen
of
the
prison
people
i
said
the
other
night
we
had
a
good
case
against
him
smiled
osborne
as
he
looked
at
with
nodding
head
did
i
did
i
tell
you
i
seen
men
sent
to
the
chair
on
less
yes
i
remember
some
such
expression
replied
the
investigator
but
you
kind
of
it
said
the
headquarters
man
smiling
even
more
broadly
than
before
you
spoke
of
other
indications
you
remember
it
was
your
idea
a
woman
was
in
it
he
looked
at
scanlon
and
laughed
recollect
that
he
asked
he
said
a
woman
had
been
hanging
around
outside
with
a
revolver
an
old
flame
of
the
bounder
maybe
scanlon
also
laughed
and
in
the
sound
was
an
indication
of
vast
relief
women
had
disappeared
out
of
the
orbit
in
which
the
crime
swung
for
scanlon
he
had
gone
for
days
with
a
fear
in
his
mind
with
his
spirit
sagging
under
a
weight
of
expectation
but
now
he
was
free
of
that
no
woman
figured
in
the
case
the
murderer
had
said
so
in
his
confession
woman
had
vanished
utterly
from
all
things
having
to
do
with
the
affair
and
so
scanlon
laughed
a
laugh
of
relief
and
as
he
looked
at
the
big
face
of
osborne
he
realized
that
while
he
had
always
liked
him
he
had
never
appreciated
him
so
much
as
now
yes
said
he
i
remember
he
rather
figured
on
the
lady
but
then
i
heard
it
said
that
you
never
can
count
on
ladies
you
do
know
just
when
you
got
there
was
a
flavor
to
this
old
saying
of
men
that
had
a
recent
tang
and
flavors
like
scents
are
most
reminiscent
yes
he
had
heard
it
only
a
very
short
time
before
and
under
unpleasant
circumstances
a
cloud
came
over
the
big
athlete
face
he
tried
to
put
the
feeling
aside
and
in
the
effort
to
do
so
memory
flared
up
and
showed
him
the
facts
it
had
been
in
duke
sheehan
place
during
his
first
talk
with
the
burglar
big
slim
it
was
the
cracksman
who
had
spoken
of
the
undependability
of
women
then
with
a
rush
came
other
things
which
he
had
said
chief
among
these
was
the
story
of
how
nora
had
followed
her
husband
on
the
night
of
the
murder
and
then
also
there
was
the
thing
he
had
seen
himself
through
the
windows
at
bohlmier
hotel
but
as
these
thoughts
pressed
forward
in
his
mind
he
crushed
them
back
they
happened
said
he
i
do
question
those
i
heard
about
and
i
know
what
i
seen
but
and
he
sighed
profoundly
she
ai
had
anything
to
do
with
that
man
death
there
no
doubt
about
that
the
party
who
did
it
has
given
it
all
up
it
as
clear
as
sunshine
on
that
point
and
the
other
thing
can
wait
explanations
for
them
can
come
at
any
time
during
the
progress
of
these
things
through
the
mind
of
scanlon
the
talk
had
proceeded
between
and
the
headquarters
man
all
right
said
osborne
i
know
you
seldom
agree
with
the
police
about
things
but
this
is
one
in
which
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
burton
himself
says
he
did
it
and
his
word
is
the
last
one
looked
at
his
cigar
with
a
favoring
eye
the
aroma
was
rich
and
through
the
smoke
he
detected
that
thin
spiral
of
a
denser
texture
which
spoke
of
the
presence
in
a
proper
proportion
of
the
leaf
he
prized
the
thing
which
makes
me
quarrel
with
the
police
in
most
instances
said
he
quietly
is
not
want
of
foresight
but
almost
a
complete
lack
of
that
vastly
commoner
gift
hindsight
take
this
present
case
for
an
example
you
have
just
claimed
that
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
that
young
burton
in
his
confession
has
spoken
the
final
word
how
often
and
he
knocked
the
spear
of
ash
from
the
cigar
have
confessions
proven
false
in
your
own
experience
look
back
over
the
last
few
years
and
you
find
at
least
six
clear
cases
of
confessions
which
were
untrue
on
the
records
of
the
district
attorney
office
is
written
a
case
years
ago
of
a
man
who
confessed
to
a
murder
and
was
hanged
afterward
it
was
proven
beyond
a
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
he
was
innocent
osborne
laughed
once
more
nevertheless
a
shade
of
doubt
darkened
the
brightness
of
his
humor
you
right
there
admitted
he
things
like
that
have
happened
but
they
are
so
few
that
we
ca
figure
on
them
this
case
and
his
jaw
set
is
sewed
up
young
burton
is
the
man
and
i
think
when
all
is
done
and
settled
you
admit
it
yourself
nodded
and
a
glint
of
humor
appeared
in
the
keen
eyes
you
can
always
be
depended
upon
to
run
close
to
form
osborne
said
he
however
when
all
is
done
and
settled
we
shall
see
what
we
shall
see
then
as
he
and
scanlon
started
through
the
lobby
he
said
over
his
shoulder
in
the
meantime
it
would
be
well
for
you
not
to
lose
sight
of
those
two
clues
i
gave
you
last
night
they
may
prove
very
useful
osborne
grinned
and
waved
a
hand
all
right
said
he
i
put
them
away
in
camphor
they
be
good
and
safe
there
as
and
bat
emerged
from
the
hotel
the
big
athlete
turned
to
his
friend
with
serious
eyes
how
much
of
what
you
just
been
saying
to
him
is
right
and
how
much
is
just
bluff
to
cover
a
place
where
you
miscued
asked
he
what
i
gave
him
are
the
facts
replied
a
confession
is
not
always
conclusive
as
i
have
just
shown
there
are
circumstances
under
which
a
man
may
confess
because
he
fears
to
have
the
real
truth
come
out
and
there
are
indications
in
this
case
which
rather
hold
that
guilt
lies
in
another
direction
than
young
burton
do
you
believe
in
spite
of
his
confession
that
he
is
innocent
i
believe
nothing
as
yet
i
am
merely
searching
for
the
truth
they
were
standing
beside
the
investigator
car
as
they
talked
and
now
gestured
his
friend
to
get
in
but
bat
shook
his
head
no
said
he
there
is
plenty
of
motion
in
a
motor
car
but
it
not
the
kind
of
motion
i
want
i
for
a
walk
and
i
like
as
not
see
you
in
the
morning
he
strode
away
down
the
street
and
for
a
moment
the
investigator
stood
gazing
after
him
then
he
opened
the
door
got
in
and
the
car
drove
away
bat
scanlon
walked
for
hours
thinking
thinking
and
out
of
it
all
he
got
only
what
the
first
few
moments
told
him
if
young
burton
had
confessed
to
a
thing
of
which
he
was
not
guilty
it
must
be
as
said
fear
that
the
real
truth
might
come
out
but
fear
of
what
there
could
only
be
one
thing
the
fear
of
the
charge
being
placed
at
the
door
of
some
one
else
and
who
could
that
some
one
else
be
but
the
one
kept
repeating
in
the
big
athlete
brain
who
could
it
be
but
here
he
feel
a
sudden
snapping
in
the
nerves
of
his
head
and
the
blood
cells
would
gorge
and
thunder
who
but
she
who
went
to
see
him
after
the
news
came
out
that
a
woman
was
suspected
and
with
an
exhausted
mind
bat
reached
his
gymnasium
danny
the
office
boy
was
there
and
looked
at
his
employer
almost
incredulously
gee
boss
you
look
all
in
he
told
him
you
ought
to
get
sebastian
to
give
you
a
going
over
sebastian
was
a
huge
bohemian
rubber
and
scanlon
agreed
to
accept
his
ministrations
after
a
bath
and
a
shower
the
bohemian
kneaded
and
punched
some
suppleness
into
him
an
hour
sleep
followed
this
and
he
was
pleased
to
find
himself
in
a
mood
for
dinner
good
said
he
that
the
right
spirit
being
down
in
the
mouth
never
helped
any
one
yet
there
still
seem
to
be
a
few
things
to
do
in
this
case
and
it
up
to
me
to
do
them
so
i
better
be
fit
if
i
going
to
get
away
with
them
it
was
while
at
dinner
that
an
idea
came
to
him
like
an
electric
shock
he
would
go
see
nora
he
would
talk
to
her
if
quite
necessary
he
tell
her
all
the
things
he
knew
and
all
those
he
suspected
and
what
she
said
in
reply
he
believe
every
word
would
be
held
to
by
him
absolutely
no
matter
what
came
or
went
after
that
he
believe
nothing
else
why
did
i
think
of
that
before
he
asked
himself
elated
just
the
thing
to
settle
it
all
the
great
trouble
with
this
affair
is
that
there
has
been
enough
plain
talk
a
little
bit
more
might
have
cleared
things
up
completely
he
smoked
contentedly
for
a
space
after
dinner
then
he
proceeded
to
nora
house
the
trim
maid
answered
his
ring
yes
miss
cavanaugh
is
at
home
scanlon
waited
in
the
large
while
his
name
was
taken
up
then
the
maid
reappeared
and
led
him
to
nora
private
here
he
found
her
in
a
robe
of
silk
and
lace
reclining
upon
a
sofa
propped
up
with
gay
pillows
a
book
beside
her
she
held
out
one
hand
to
him
the
loose
sleeve
fell
back
showing
a
beautiful
arm
white
and
firm
and
rounded
magnificently
oh
i
glad
to
see
you
bat
she
said
and
her
tone
and
eyes
confirmed
the
truth
of
her
words
it
been
days
and
days
since
you
were
here
i
think
i
called
you
on
the
telephone
i
do
know
how
many
times
but
never
could
find
you
in
i
sorry
he
said
but
this
is
kind
of
a
busy
time
with
me
she
pointed
to
a
low
chair
very
deep
and
comfortable
looking
which
was
near
the
sofa
get
a
pillow
for
your
back
she
said
and
sit
there
he
did
as
commanded
and
she
looked
at
him
with
something
like
wistfulness
in
her
great
eyes
oh
it
so
nice
to
have
you
there
bat
you
can
be
so
still
and
wonderful
when
you
want
to
still
yes
agreed
scanlon
but
i
not
so
sure
about
the
wonderful
she
smiled
at
him
if
you
were
quite
sure
of
that
she
said
you
would
be
nearly
so
nice
her
great
mass
of
bronze
hair
was
loosely
arranged
about
her
head
and
against
the
delicate
blue
of
a
pillow
it
shone
like
red
gold
in
the
light
of
the
reading
lamp
i
so
glad
it
is
sunday
she
went
on
and
that
i
am
not
to
play
for
i
tired
bat
more
tired
than
you
believe
i
believe
it
no
matter
how
strong
you
made
it
said
he
what
you
gone
through
has
been
enough
to
tire
any
one
she
reached
out
and
patted
his
hand
gently
as
it
rested
upon
the
arm
of
his
chair
bat
you
are
so
big
and
strong
that
you
seem
to
give
out
sympathy
naturally
and
that
is
a
quality
which
all
women
like
she
paused
a
moment
her
white
strong
fingers
trifled
with
the
bracelet
of
raw
gold
her
eyes
were
bright
as
though
with
tears
and
there
was
a
sad
little
smile
about
the
corners
of
her
mouth
and
it
is
so
easy
for
a
woman
to
be
mistaken
in
men
she
proceeded
in
the
end
she
always
selects
and
holds
to
one
and
she
is
apt
to
judge
all
the
others
by
if
he
is
weak
she
feels
that
all
men
are
weak
if
he
is
strong
they
are
all
strong
and
if
he
is
cruel
and
mean
and
selfish
she
feels
a
desire
to
hate
them
all
and
sometimes
she
does
bat
nodded
his
head
slowly
and
wisely
sure
he
said
that
to
be
expected
but
in
the
end
hopefully
her
mind
often
clears
up
on
that
point
she
finds
if
she
gives
herself
the
chance
that
there
is
really
a
big
difference
between
them
you
have
some
idea
what
my
experience
has
been
in
the
last
five
years
or
so
she
said
it
has
not
been
beautiful
bat
it
has
at
times
been
hideously
ugly
and
the
tears
i
have
wept
and
the
things
i
have
borne
and
the
vows
i
have
made
have
been
very
many
there
have
been
times
when
i
could
think
only
of
death
so
completely
humbled
have
i
felt
so
without
spirit
so
utterly
in
tom
burton
power
i
have
told
you
something
of
his
slimy
plots
of
his
detestable
innuendoes
he
knew
of
my
loathing
of
the
divorce
courts
and
my
fear
of
scandal
no
matter
how
unfounded
and
played
upon
them
constantly
feeling
sure
that
in
the
end
i
would
meet
his
demands
but
that
all
over
nora
said
bat
it
all
belongs
to
the
past
try
to
forget
it
i
am
going
to
forget
it
she
said
never
doubt
that
i
going
to
put
it
away
from
me
and
never
think
of
it
again
i
speak
of
it
only
because
i
have
something
in
my
mind
which
recalls
it
strongly
as
altogether
dissimilar
things
sometimes
do
all
men
are
not
evil
bat
i
suppose
i
have
really
known
that
always
but
now
the
fact
comes
forward
in
my
mind
and
takes
the
place
of
the
fear
i
have
had
for
so
long
some
men
are
really
very
good
very
kind
and
gentle
some
of
them
perhaps
only
a
few
would
sacrifice
themselves
to
assure
the
security
of
one
who
was
unhappy
and
in
trouble
bat
scanlon
coughed
and
stirred
in
his
chair
when
did
that
idea
come
to
you
he
asked
she
replied
just
and
but
here
she
suddenly
stopped
and
the
man
saw
a
startled
look
flash
over
her
face
but
of
course
she
resumed
hastily
these
things
never
come
to
us
at
the
time
we
first
realize
their
presence
they
are
a
growth
it
is
said
and
it
takes
time
for
them
to
make
themselves
known
in
spirit
bat
scanlon
felt
himself
sinking
to
the
level
of
the
afternoon
sacrifice
to
assure
the
security
of
one
who
was
unhappy
and
in
trouble
what
did
that
mean
nora
had
been
in
that
position
young
burton
according
to
the
theory
of
had
made
just
such
a
sacrifice
nora
had
been
in
a
state
of
great
agitation
she
had
visited
the
prisoner
just
before
his
confession
of
guilt
and
now
she
was
quieted
she
was
smiling
and
grateful
the
big
man
got
up
and
walked
the
floor
she
followed
him
with
her
great
brown
eyes
bat
she
said
you
are
nervous
and
now
that
i
look
at
you
you
are
pinched
and
not
of
a
good
color
she
lifted
herself
up
upon
one
elbow
and
continued
accusingly
you
have
been
worrying
confess
i
have
said
he
this
matter
of
burton
death
has
fastened
itself
upon
me
tight
i
ca
shake
it
off
but
she
said
why
should
that
be
unless
and
she
paused
while
she
looked
at
him
searchingly
it
is
because
of
me
it
because
of
you
replied
scanlon
for
burton
was
no
kind
of
a
fellow
for
me
to
worry
about
things
will
go
much
better
without
him
but
and
she
looked
at
him
steadfastly
if
that
is
the
case
then
i
should
be
much
happier
as
it
is
so
why
should
you
worry
and
grow
pale
and
not
be
able
to
sit
quietly
and
talk
to
me
he
was
about
to
begin
some
sort
of
an
answer
to
this
at
the
moment
he
was
standing
in
a
position
which
gave
him
a
view
of
the
street
through
one
of
the
windows
his
glance
wandered
in
that
direction
his
mind
occupied
in
forming
a
set
of
phrases
which
would
be
sufficiently
evasive
but
suddenly
the
gaze
became
fixed
a
man
stood
upon
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
looking
toward
nora
house
the
street
lights
were
in
his
face
and
gleamed
upon
a
pair
of
large
spectacles
one
hand
was
furtively
gesturing
as
though
in
signals
to
some
one
down
below
the
man
was
the
swiss
bohlmier
chapter
xviii
nora
goes
to
stanwick
through
the
upheaving
in
his
mind
bat
scanlon
managed
to
squeeze
a
reply
to
nora
question
which
held
some
traces
of
plausibility
a
fellow
always
feels
upset
by
things
like
this
said
he
most
of
the
time
there
is
no
reason
for
it
but
that
seems
to
make
no
difference
he
feels
that
way
just
the
same
he
left
the
window
and
returned
to
his
chair
there
had
been
many
things
in
his
mind
when
he
resolved
to
pay
this
visit
things
which
were
direct
and
the
answers
to
which
must
be
illuminating
but
they
were
all
gone
now
her
attitude
her
words
had
made
them
impossible
they
talked
of
many
things
during
the
next
half
hour
that
is
nora
talked
what
scanlon
said
he
could
never
afterward
remember
but
there
was
one
thing
which
always
brought
the
fact
of
the
conversation
sharply
to
his
mind
and
that
was
his
conjectures
as
to
the
man
in
the
street
below
why
was
he
there
and
to
whom
was
he
signaling
these
thoughts
finally
became
so
insistent
that
bat
arose
i
must
be
going
he
said
rather
lamely
there
are
a
few
things
i
must
do
oh
and
i
thought
you
come
for
a
nice
long
visit
she
said
her
tone
was
reproachful
but
at
the
same
time
scanlon
could
not
help
but
notice
that
the
glance
which
she
gave
the
briskly
ticking
clock
was
one
of
relief
he
stood
looking
down
at
her
finally
her
eyes
lifted
to
his
and
the
expression
she
met
was
very
grave
and
very
honest
nora
said
he
i
always
been
for
you
you
know
that
do
you
and
i
always
will
be
for
you
so
if
there
is
ever
trouble
any
at
all
you
know
where
to
come
she
arose
nora
was
a
tall
woman
but
she
had
to
lift
her
face
so
that
her
eyes
might
meet
his
she
laid
both
hands
upon
his
breast
and
when
she
spoke
there
was
just
the
least
tremble
in
her
voice
i
know
she
said
dear
old
bat
i
know
have
i
always
called
on
you
when
i
needed
help
and
you
were
near
enough
to
hear
you
are
the
most
loyal
friend
a
woman
could
have
i
have
been
grateful
for
you
bat
and
i
have
prayed
for
you
many
times
no
said
scanlon
no
have
you
though
nora
well
what
do
you
know
about
that
when
he
went
down
the
stairs
he
had
a
lump
in
his
throat
and
there
was
a
tendency
to
blink
drops
from
his
lashes
bat
would
have
denied
indignantly
that
they
were
tears
which
amazed
him
in
the
lower
hall
he
met
the
maid
is
there
a
way
out
beside
the
front
door
he
asked
oh
yes
there
is
a
door
which
opens
onto
a
yard
beside
the
old
carriage
house
said
the
girl
i
go
out
that
way
said
bat
surprised
but
making
no
comment
the
maid
led
the
way
scanlon
passed
through
a
door
into
the
yard
and
then
through
a
gate
which
opened
upon
a
small
quiet
street
thank
you
said
he
and
when
the
gate
had
been
closed
and
the
maid
vanished
he
started
down
the
street
in
a
few
moments
he
had
rounded
the
corner
then
a
dozen
yards
brought
him
to
the
thoroughfare
on
which
nora
house
stood
cautiously
he
peered
from
a
sheltering
doorway
yes
there
was
the
figure
of
the
swiss
in
the
same
position
as
before
and
as
scanlon
looked
he
saw
a
tall
man
cross
the
street
and
stop
at
bohlmier
side
big
slim
said
bat
that
who
the
sign
was
being
passed
to
a
while
ago
he
watched
the
two
men
while
they
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
then
they
started
off
and
he
followed
them
however
they
did
not
go
far
at
the
intersection
of
a
small
street
they
paused
and
then
disappeared
something
in
their
manner
of
doing
this
told
bat
their
intention
they
are
going
to
lie
low
just
around
the
corner
he
said
waiting
for
something
i
think
he
was
but
a
dozen
yards
from
nora
house
at
this
moment
and
at
an
ornamental
iron
gate
of
the
period
just
after
the
civil
war
stood
an
aged
colored
man
very
black
very
highly
collared
and
with
much
of
the
dignity
of
a
servant
of
the
old
time
bat
paused
and
said
with
the
carelessness
of
a
casual
stroller
nice
old
street
you
have
here
uncle
there
was
the
proper
amount
of
confidence
in
the
big
athlete
manner
and
his
voice
had
that
subtle
shade
of
authority
which
carried
the
remark
in
its
proper
groove
for
these
ancient
servitors
are
to
be
approached
in
only
one
way
if
results
are
to
be
had
yas
suh
replied
the
black
man
at
the
gate
yas
suh
it
is
a
nice
ol
street
suh
not
whut
it
was
yeahs
ago
when
i
fust
come
here
no
suh
but
nice
and
quiet
and
of
course
said
bat
sure
enough
entirely
respectable
he
watched
and
saw
that
the
two
did
not
reappear
at
the
street
corner
a
feeling
of
doubt
was
in
his
mind
he
had
no
means
of
knowing
if
his
conjectures
as
to
their
movements
were
true
however
if
they
had
gone
very
well
if
they
had
not
well
he
would
be
there
and
would
know
yes
he
went
on
a
fine
old
block
not
many
like
it
left
no
suh

indeed

apparently
bat
had
chanced
upon
a
favorite
topic
like
many
of
the
old
families
of
whom
he
spoke
so
regretfully
the
ancient
cherished
the
days
of
the
past
this
bat
felt
to
be
rather
fortunate
it
would
provide
a
subject
for
conversation
while
he
stood
waiting
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
which
ran
along
in
front
of
the
houses
a
new
section
will
grow
up
he
suggested
and
new
families
will
proceed
to
grow
old
in
them
and
make
them
also
respectable
but
the
old
darkey
refused
to
consider
this
no
suh
possible
dey
never
be
like
de
ol
folks
not
like
yo
ca

no
suh
bat
was
still
engaged
in
talk
with
the
ancient
darkey
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
when
he
saw
the
door
of
nora
cavanaugh
house
open
and
a
woman
emerge
though
she
was
enveloped
in
a
long
coat
and
furs
there
was
no
mistaking
the
air
the
free
splendid
carriage
it
was
nora
with
a
glance
up
and
down
the
street
she
descended
the
steps
and
made
her
way
north
as
she
passed
the
corner
scanlon
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
one
opposite
her
with
a
tingling
of
the
blood
he
saw
the
two
men
bob
out
with
furtive
eagerness
and
in
a
few
moments
they
were
following
her
he
at
once
said
to
the
old
servant
and
fell
in
their
wake
nora
walked
rapidly
within
ten
minutes
from
the
fixedness
of
her
direction
bat
guessed
her
destination
the
railroad
station
he
said
the
railroad
station
as
sure
as
you
live
this
guess
proved
a
good
one
the
huge
pile
of
the
station
soon
loomed
into
view
the
lights
about
its
top
dimming
in
the
mists
of
the
evening
the
great
round
clock
looking
solemnly
out
across
the
city
bat
saw
the
two
men
follow
into
the
building
he
at
once
stationed
himself
at
a
door
through
the
glass
of
which
he
had
a
view
of
the
ticket
window
nora
went
without
hesitation
to
a
certain
window
far
down
the
room
in
a
few
moments
she
turned
away
a
ticket
in
her
hand
and
her
eyes
going
to
the
clock
and
as
she
disappeared
up
the
stairs
which
led
to
the
train
shed
bohlmier
and
big
slim
slipped
up
to
the
window
purchased
tickets
and
followed
her
when
they
were
out
of
sight
bat
entered
and
walked
down
the
huge
room
over
the
window
to
which
the
others
had
gone
he
saw
a
sign
which
told
him
the
tickets
for
sale
there
were
for
the
branch
road
upon
which
lay
the
suburb
of
stanwick
bat
also
bought
a
ticket
in
the
train
shed
a
light
over
a
gate
called
his
attention
to
the
three
cars
which
usually
made
up
the
local
for
the
western
suburbs
nora
was
not
in
sight
the
swiss
and
big
slim
were
climbing
into
a
dingy
combination
baggage
and
smoking
car
which
was
directly
behind
the
engine
i
do
want
to
get
into
the
car
nora
in
mused
bat
and
as
an
experienced
traveler
i
say
that
was
the
middle
one
he
entered
the
last
car
by
the
rear
door
a
glance
showed
him
that
nora
was
not
there
and
he
settled
himself
in
a
corner
seat
opening
a
newspaper
and
holding
it
before
him
so
as
to
avoid
even
the
small
chances
of
detection
in
a
few
minutes
the
train
started
and
in
half
an
hour
it
brought
up
at
stanwick
from
his
window
he
saw
nora
on
the
platform
his
first
impulse
was
to
get
out
on
the
other
side
of
the
train
but
instantly
he
realized
that
he
must
not
do
this
it
the
very
thing
those
other
two
gentlemen
will
do
and
they
spot
me
sure
he
thought
so
he
waited
until
the
last
possible
moment
he
dropped
from
the
car
as
the
train
was
pulling
out
and
a
heaped
up
baggage
truck
hid
him
from
view
he
saw
bohlmier
and
big
slim
pass
cautiously
along
the
length
of
the
platform
and
out
of
sight
and
then
pursuers
and
pursued
made
away
in
the
direction
of
duncan
street
it
getting
to
be
familiar
ground
said
the
big
athlete
i
think
i
could
find
my
way
there
with
my
eyes
shut
the
streets
of
stanwick
were
lighted
here
and
there
by
incandescent
lights
which
shone
yellowly
through
the
heavy
darkness
bat
could
not
be
sure
as
to
what
was
going
on
ahead
of
him
as
the
two
men
were
careful
to
keep
out
of
the
rays
of
the
lamps
as
they
passed
them
so
he
proceeded
slowly
with
only
occasional
glimpses
of
the
moving
figures
finally
as
he
neared
the
burton
home
he
lost
them
entirely
they
taken
cover
said
he
between
his
teeth
and
now
i
have
to
trust
to
chance
keeping
in
the
darkness
as
much
as
possible
he
advanced
and
in
a
little
while
he
saw
a
muffled
figure
standing
before
a
gate
as
though
hesitating
it
was
nora
and
the
house
before
which
she
had
halted
was
no
however
the
hesitancy
did
not
last
long
for
as
he
watched
she
pushed
open
the
gate
and
made
her
way
toward
the
house
scanlon
waited
his
eyes
going
about
in
expectation
of
a
movement
of
some
sort
from
the
shadows
around
him
but
none
came
and
he
gave
his
attention
once
more
to
nora
he
saw
her
move
along
the
path
as
though
to
the
door
over
which
burned
a
light
however
when
within
a
half
dozen
yards
of
it
she
veered
to
one
side
and
to
bat
surprise
stole
with
quiet
tread
around
the
house
chapter
xix
in
the
dark
as
bat
scanlon
saw
nora
disappear
around
the
burton
house
he
once
more
awaited
some
developments
from
the
shadows
but
again
there
was
no
sign
of
the
presence
of
either
the
swiss
or
the
lank
burglar
so
after
a
little
he
moved
on
until
he
reached
the
gate
of
the
adjoining
house
and
quietly
lifted
the
latch
a
dog
from
somewhere
in
the
darkness
barked
bat
halted
and
listened
but
there
were
no
further
sounds
and
so
he
went
on
placing
his
hands
upon
the
low
division
fence
he
bounded
over
upon
the
burton
lawn
almost
directly
before
him
was
the
rose
arbor
behind
which
had
discovered
the
woman
footprints
and
the
big
athlete
took
his
place
in
the
deep
shadow
of
this
and
looked
about
the
window
of
the
burton
was
lighted
inside
was
mary
burton
in
her
reclining
chair
propped
up
by
pillows
and
reading
the
shaded
lamp
cast
a
soft
glow
upon
her
the
white
face
wore
an
expression
of
suffering
and
with
this
was
a
meekness
a
submission
which
made
it
a
woman
form
flitted
between
scanlon
and
the
window
it
stopped
and
then
the
watcher
saw
nora
cavanaugh
peering
in
at
the
sick
girl
her
notions
of
a
social
call
seem
to
have
picked
up
a
twist
somewhere
said
bat
to
himself
what
the
idea
however
nora
only
remained
at
the
window
for
a
few
moments
then
she
disappeared
in
the
direction
from
which
she
had
come
in
bat
mind
was
a
picture
of
two
lurking
men
the
lank
desperado
and
the
mild
looking
yet
murderous
swiss
and
he
felt
a
chill
of
fear
as
he
gazed
into
the
darkness
which
had
swallowed
the
girl
up
a
moment
or
two
passed
then
he
heard
the
quick
of
an
electric
bell
from
the
house
the
said
bat
through
the
sound
of
a
hundred
others
match
myself
to
pick
the
one
attached
to
the
door
of
any
house
they
are
all
of
the
same
family
another
little
pause
then
he
saw
nora
in
the
the
nurse
behind
her
and
the
sick
girl
reaching
out
her
hand
gladly
bat
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
all
right
said
he
inside
she
not
so
likely
to
meet
those
gentlemen
the
nurse
disappeared
from
the
nora
sat
down
and
began
to
talk
with
the
invalid
earnestly
outside
all
was
still
after
a
little
bat
searched
the
surrounding
shadows
intently
for
anything
that
might
indicate
the
whereabouts
of
big
slim
and
bohlmier
but
the
darkness
was
silent
and
complete
the
windows
of
the
houses
opposite
and
adjoining
were
lighted
from
one
some
little
distance
away
came
the
faint
tinkling
of
a
mandolin
and
the
deeper
sounding
strings
of
a
guitar
from
still
another
came
fresh
young
voices
singing
an
evening
hymn
figures
could
be
seen
through
the
windows
or
silhouetted
upon
the
shades
at
one
bat
saw
a
tiny
girl
and
a
very
large
dog
who
seemed
her
especial
chum
they
romped
gaily
bat
heard
the
child
laugh
and
the
dog
bark
nice
he
mused
nice
and
homey
regular
sunday
night
stuff
in
the
bosom
of
the
family
but
no
sign
of
the
two
gentlemen
who
did
the
shadowing
they
are
lying
low
i
guess
same
as
i
am
he
gave
his
attention
once
more
to
the
nora
and
the
sick
girl
were
still
engaged
in
conversation
as
bat
looked
nora
took
a
crumpled
newspaper
page
from
her
as
though
it
were
a
part
of
what
she
was
telling
the
girl
in
the
chair
lifted
herself
up
eagerly
took
the
paper
in
her
hand
and
read
the
staring
then
bat
saw
it
flutter
to
the
floor
he
saw
her
sit
upright
for
a
moment
gazing
at
nora
with
eyes
she
sank
back
suddenly
and
heavily
upon
the
cushions
fainted
said
bat
excitedly
leaning
forward
he
saw
nora
arise
quickly
and
bend
over
the
girl
then
he
saw
her
open
the
door
calling
the
nurse
said
he
in
a
moment
the
nurse
was
in
the
room
and
under
the
care
of
the
two
the
invalid
was
soon
restored
to
consciousness
then
followed
a
period
of
comforting
of
patting
pillows
into
shape
of
cheerful
assurance
nora
then
kissed
the
invalid
and
bid
her
she
left
the
room
with
the
nurse
following
her
just
came
evidently
to
give
her
the
news
said
bat
to
himself
but
i
wonder
why
the
haste
it
was
the
kind
of
news
that
would
give
joy
or
anything
like
that
in
a
few
moments
he
heard
the
front
door
close
and
steps
upon
the
walk
these
ceased
after
a
moment
there
was
silence
and
then
to
his
amazement
nora
once
more
flitted
through
the
darkness
and
came
between
himself
and
the
window
there
is
a
reason
for
it
said
bat
she
not
doing
all
this
out
of
just
idle
curiosity
but
what
it
leads
to
is
a
thing
i
do
the
thought
was
halted
unfinished
in
his
mind
for
through
the
darkness
quite
close
at
hand
came
a
cautiously
moving
shape
and
from
its
direction
it
was
also
seeking
the
shelter
of
the
rose
arbor
there
was
a
door
in
the
far
side
of
the
latter
as
bat
had
noticed
on
the
day
of
investigation
he
slipped
quietly
around
and
in
at
this
and
through
the
trellis
work
he
watched
what
was
proceeding
outside
the
first
glance
showed
him
that
nora
was
now
also
moving
toward
the
arbor
and
the
thought
of
what
might
occur
upon
her
meeting
with
the
prowler
in
the
dark
caused
scanlon
hand
to
go
inquiringly
to
the
big
revolver
which
he
carried
in
the
breast
pocket
of
his
coat
and
to
shift
it
to
a
place
where
it
would
be
more
convenient
but
though
he
strained
his
eyes
to
catch
some
indications
of
the
shadowy
figure
he
had
seen
only
a
moment
or
two
before
he
could
not
do
so
it
had
vanished
this
did
not
add
anything
to
the
big
quietude
of
mind
for
the
footsteps
of
nora
dulled
by
springy
sod
were
now
close
at
hand
the
girl
reached
the
arbor
and
took
up
the
position
which
bat
had
lately
occupied
and
he
knew
that
she
had
settled
herself
for
a
vigil
to
watch
all
that
passed
in
the
of
the
burton
house
naturally
the
eyes
of
the
big
man
also
went
in
that
direction
once
more
the
nurse
had
returned
to
the
room
and
was
bending
over
the
invalid
a
glass
in
her
hand
the
girl
lay
motionless
her
face
turned
upward
and
her
thin
hands
pathetically
folded
the
nurse
after
she
had
succeeded
in
inducing
the
patient
to
take
a
few
drops
of
what
she
held
to
her
lips
busied
herself
with
some
things
upon
a
small
table
near
the
chair
then
she
left
the
room
there
was
a
pause
no
movement
came
from
the
room
whatsoever
bat
fancied
that
the
sick
girl
had
gone
to
sleep
but
this
thought
had
no
sooner
taken
shape
in
his
mind
than
he
saw
her
stir
then
she
arose
slowly
in
the
chair
and
sat
apparently
listening
her
manner
surprisingly
alert
only
a
few
moments
ago
she
had
shown
every
sign
of
exhaustion
now
her
strength
was
unquestioned
for
her
body
was
firmly
held
and
her
grip
upon
the
arms
of
the
chair
was
sure
there
came
a
little
gasp
from
nora
crouching
behind
the
rose
arbor
surprised
thought
bat
and
no
wonder
i
just
a
little
bit
that
way
myself
mary
burton
threw
back
the
blanket
in
which
she
was
swathed
and
stood
up
she
wore
a
long
dressing
gown
tied
about
the
waist
from
a
pocket
of
this
she
took
something
and
then
after
a
moment
of
listening
approached
an
old
mahogany
unlocked
and
opened
a
drawer
and
looked
into
it
almost
at
once
it
was
slid
back
into
place
and
relocked
the
girl
stood
poised
for
an
instant
as
though
not
sure
as
to
what
her
next
movement
would
be
then
she
went
tiptoeing
to
the
door
opened
it
and
disappeared
nora
drew
a
long
breath
and
scanlon
as
he
stood
amazed
felt
like
echoing
it
but
the
next
instant
all
that
which
had
happened
in
the
surprising
as
it
had
been
was
wiped
from
his
mind
from
outside
there
came
a
voice
that
of
old
bohlmier
do
not
make
some
noise
it
said
a
gasp
came
from
nora
a
gasp
which
would
have
been
a
scream
if
fear
had
not
suppressed
it
i
will
talk
a
little
with
you
if
you
blease
there
was
an
instant
silence
bat
pressed
hard
against
the
trellis
work
of
the
arbor
only
a
few
inches
separated
him
from
the
girl
outside
and
he
could
hear
her
breath
catching
sharply
in
her
throat
as
she
spoke
who
are
you
we
will
nod
speak
of
that
said
the
swiss
only
we
will
talk
of
things
that
interesting
are
this
seemed
to
have
a
tonic
effect
upon
nora
when
she
answered
her
breathing
had
become
almost
normal
her
voice
was
strong
and
held
some
confidence
i
know
you
now
she
said
i
saw
you
the
other
night
old
bohlmier
chuckled
ach
yes
the
other
night
you
saw
me
yes
but
you
spoke
to
me
not
now
it
will
the
other
way
be
eh
what
do
you
want
asked
nora
sharply
do
you
so
ask
bohlmier
tone
was
one
of
astonishment
is
it
possible
there
is
one
supject
only
which
we
can
talk
about
is
it
not
so
one
supject
yes
i
thought
i
told
your
friend
all
i
had
to
say
about
that
said
the
girl
ach
no
it
is
not
true
if
he
had
been
able
to
see
the
old
rascal
scanlon
was
sure
his
head
would
be
wagging
and
a
mild
smile
would
be
upon
his
face
you
told
him
so
yes
but
it
is
not
true
much
more
have
you
to
say
blenty
more
and
you
will
say
it
to
me
eh
now
the
vision
bat
had
in
his
mind
became
more
and
more
clear
not
only
would
the
bald
head
be
moving
from
side
to
side
but
it
would
be
thrust
forward
in
the
deadly
motion
which
the
big
athlete
had
seen
once
before
and
the
smile
he
had
never
seen
one
like
that
which
his
ear
told
him
bohlmier
would
be
a
mild
quizzical
smile
which
was
a
habit
of
the
muscles
only
and
through
which
a
pair
of
eyes
gleamed
with
devilish
purpose
has
he
got
me
nervous
or
something
bat
asked
himself
or
do
i
call
the
turn
on
him
right
my
friend
proceeded
the
old
swiss
is
a
chentleman
much
ezberienced
in
certain
things
in
others
he
has
not
so
much
exberience
as
that
and
the
listener
heard
him
snap
his
fingers
sharply
not
so
much
as
that
and
so
he
let
you
go
without
some
understandings
bat
heard
nora
laugh
it
was
not
a
pleasant
laugh
nevertheless
it
caused
a
thrill
of
pleasure
to
shoot
through
him
good
he
thought
she
has
her
nerve
with
her
he
has
scared
her
even
a
little
bit
perhaps
said
nora
to
bohlmier
you
have
the
experience
he
lacked
i
haf
the
handling
of
many
affairs
had
came
the
voice
of
the
swiss
smoothly
and
from
the
first
i
asked
for
this
one
for
i
knew
dear
lady
i
could
the
resulds
get
you
mean
you
thought
you
could
frighten
me
where
he
failed
again
nora
laughed
you
have
confidence
then
with
a
note
of
curiosity
in
her
voice
what
would
you
have
done
a
sudden
sharp
movement
came
from
outside
the
rose
arbor
bat
heard
the
hissing
of
bohlmier
breath
and
a
sharp
cry
from
nora
a
diminished
light
ray
unseen
in
any
other
way
was
caught
upon
the
uplifted
blade
of
a
knife
then
bat
drove
his
arms
through
the
frail
trellis
work
with
the
left
hand
he
gripped
the
arm
of
the
swiss
and
twisted
it
wickedly
the
knife
was
heard
to
strike
against
the
side
of
the
arbor
as
it
fell
bat
right
hand
at
the
same
instant
slipped
along
the
man
body
and
gripped
his
throat
like
iron
and
as
he
held
him
he
heard
the
muffled
sound
of
nora
steps
as
she
fled
away
chapter
xx
queer
intelligence
the
grip
of
bat
scanlon
upon
the
throat
of
bohlmier
did
not
relax
both
hands
of
the
swiss
clutched
at
the
arm
thrust
through
the
trellis
work
of
the
rose
arbor
but
their
puny
strength
was
as
nothing
against
the
brawn
of
the
big
athlete
after
a
little
the
hands
lost
their
power
and
slid
helplessly
away
scanlon
no
longer
heard
the
wheezing
breath
in
the
man
chest
and
so
he
let
go
his
grip
bohlmier
crumpled
up
and
fell
to
the
ground
bat
drew
his
arms
through
the
frail
woodwork
there
were
many
abrasions
upon
his
knuckles
and
he
was
nursing
these
solicitously
when
he
heard
the
stumbling
approach
of
some
one
through
the
darkness
instantly
he
was
all
attention
for
a
moment
he
fancied
it
was
nora
returning
but
the
steps
were
not
like
hers
they
were
those
of
a
man
within
a
few
yards
of
the
rose
arbor
they
stopped
there
was
a
silence
and
then
a
voice
said
whisperingly
hello
bohlmier
are
you
there
big
slim
was
bat
mental
exclamation
hunting
up
his
pal
as
no
reply
came
to
the
lank
burglar
low
call
that
gentleman
moved
nearer
there
was
an
awkward
scrambling
a
heavy
body
struck
the
side
of
the
rose
arbor
and
set
it
creaking
then
the
voice
of
big
slim
was
heard
uttering
guarded
but
profane
remarks
he
fallen
over
the
swiss
bat
told
himself
grimly
that
this
was
true
was
proven
in
another
moment
there
came
a
breath
from
the
man
outside
as
though
he
made
a
startling
discovery
then
bat
saw
the
glimmer
of
a
light
faint
and
guarded
but
enough
to
show
the
figure
of
the
swiss
huddled
on
the
ground
and
with
another
stooping
over
it
the
light
suddenly
snapped
off
silence
and
darkness
followed
the
silence
was
so
long
continued
that
bat
grew
uneasy
he
was
anxious
to
once
more
get
on
the
track
of
nora
also
he
was
not
quite
sure
as
to
his
own
position
it
was
easy
to
see
through
this
place
just
then
he
thought
that
light
must
have
shone
in
a
little
my
friend
outside
is
a
person
of
observation
so
how
do
i
know
he
has
spotted
the
fact
that
some
one
is
here
that
the
burglar
could
have
recognized
him
even
if
this
were
so
was
impossible
for
the
light
was
too
brief
and
too
dim
but
that
he
had
caught
sight
of
some
one
inside
the
arbor
was
within
probability
so
bat
stepped
with
great
caution
toward
the
doorway
as
he
reached
it
he
saw
or
perhaps
felt
that
there
was
a
bulk
directly
before
him
much
denser
than
the
darkness
and
as
he
studied
this
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
was
about
the
size
of
a
man
but
he
was
not
at
all
sure
so
he
stood
very
still
all
his
thews
flexed
and
waited
for
it
to
move
in
a
few
moments
there
came
a
slow
stirring
the
bulk
seemed
to
push
forward
this
was
all
scanlon
required
he
lashed
out
with
his
right
fist
it
crashed
into
a
living
something
with
frightful
force
there
was
a
low
outcry
and
a
fall
and
then
bat
stepped
out
into
the
night
and
was
away
a
score
of
paces
from
the
rose
arbor
he
stopped
he
had
not
the
least
idea
as
to
the
direction
nora
had
taken
and
so
was
puzzled
about
the
next
thing
to
do
but
after
the
fright
she
had
gotten
he
felt
sure
that
she
not
linger
about
the
little
patch
of
ground
surrounding
no
duncan
street
she
away
to
the
station
he
said
and
that
my
play
so
in
a
few
moments
he
was
on
the
street
and
hurrying
toward
the
station
when
within
two
score
yards
of
it
he
heard
a
bell
clang
and
caught
the
hiss
of
released
steam
then
a
train
pulled
out
and
rolled
away
down
the
dark
line
of
track
the
station
lights
were
out
the
platform
was
deserted
and
the
waiting
room
when
he
tried
the
door
was
locked
like
as
not
she
caught
that
train
mused
bat
as
he
stood
upon
the
platform
and
if
so
all
right
he
looked
at
a
train
schedule
with
the
aid
of
a
match
and
then
at
his
watch
ten
said
he
that
an
hour
yet
some
wait
and
a
dismal
unproductive
hour
too
the
deserted
platform
the
chill
winds
and
the
drizzle
of
rain
made
it
most
uncomfortable
i
ought
to
be
doing
something
said
he
i
ought
to
be
of
course
he
ought
to
be
at
the
burton
house
he
ought
to
be
trying
to
learn
what
was
behind
the
marvel
of
the
invalid
girl
who
so
suddenly
became
well
he
ought
to
be
eager
and
anxious
to
discover
the
objective
of
her
cautious
movements
at
once
without
any
hesitancy
he
hurried
back
along
the
way
he
had
just
come
lights
still
burned
brightly
in
comfortable
little
houses
set
back
from
the
street
they
glowed
with
cheer
and
family
life
but
on
the
way
he
did
not
encounter
a
single
pedestrian
stanwick
is
strictly
an
indoor
place
on
a
rainy
sunday
night
he
mused
as
he
hurried
along
and
i
do
know
that
it
has
the
best
of
it
he
was
inside
the
iron
fence
at
no
when
he
detected
the
first
signs
of
a
stir
these
were
the
low
sounds
of
careful
steps
on
the
walk
and
the
murmur
of
conversation
he
crouched
in
the
shadow
thrown
by
the
house
the
steps
grew
nearer
and
he
recognized
the
voices
as
those
of
big
slim
and
bohlmier
i
haf
not
much
strength
wheezed
the
swiss
holt
me
up
ach
what
a
grip
it
was
like
a
gorilla
as
they
drew
opposite
to
bat
he
saw
in
an
uncertain
sort
of
way
that
the
burglar
was
supporting
his
friend
grip
said
big
slim
well
the
wallop
he
carried
had
some
heft
too
once
i
thought
i
had
him
he
stood
right
in
front
of
me
but
as
i
was
reaching
for
my
he
drove
one
at
me
that
a
bull
could
have
stood
up
under
that
woman
gasped
bohlmier
she
is
full
of
tricks
yet
who
would
haf
thought
she
had
somebodies
here
with
her
what
the
burglar
replied
bat
could
not
catch
for
by
this
time
they
had
reached
the
sidewalk
under
the
light
he
saw
the
swiss
was
holding
to
the
other
feebly
and
that
his
steps
were
tottering
and
weak
i
must
have
shut
down
on
him
even
harder
than
i
thought
said
bat
to
himself
it
was
the
knife
that
did
it
and
him
whipping
it
out
on
nora
he
waited
until
the
two
had
disappeared
then
he
made
his
way
softly
around
the
house
on
the
side
he
had
not
examined
before
here
the
windows
were
all
blank
and
dark
except
one
at
the
extreme
rear
there
he
could
see
the
colored
maid
washing
some
glassware
this
window
was
partly
open
and
he
heard
the
woman
voice
singing
swing
low
sweet
chariot
come
fo
to
carry
me
home
bat
stood
for
a
while
in
silent
inspection
of
the
place
nothing
doing
evidently
he
said
just
as
quiet
as
you
please
he
turned
his
eyes
for
a
few
moments
upon
the
surrounding
houses
and
when
they
wandered
back
he
noted
with
a
start
that
one
of
the
upper
windows
was
now
illuminated
he
stared
steadfastly
at
it
and
as
he
was
doing
so
the
light
grew
brighter
he
stood
wondering
at
this
then
he
saw
mary
burton
a
candle
in
her
hand
appear
at
the
window
but
this
was
only
for
a
moment
she
moved
away
and
the
light
dimmed
finally
disappearing
completely
she
left
the
room
and
closed
the
door
said
bat
a
few
moments
passed
and
then
a
second
window
this
time
on
the
floor
below
flashed
up
with
light
it
remained
so
for
some
little
time
now
growing
dimmer
and
now
stronger
showing
that
the
girl
was
moving
about
the
room
then
like
the
other
the
window
suddenly
became
blank
one
after
another
the
windows
were
lighted
up
in
the
same
fashion
sometimes
bat
saw
the
girl
her
dressing
gown
held
about
her
with
one
hand
while
with
the
other
she
held
the
candlestick
then
both
she
and
the
light
disappeared
altogether
quite
an
active
little
excursion
said
bat
quite
active
and
extraordinary
what
is
it
about
i
wonder
why
this
sudden
parade
through
the
house
on
the
quiet
he
remained
where
he
was
for
a
short
space
of
time
but
all
was
silent
save
for
the
maid
crooning
the
hymn
and
the
occasional
inquiring
bark
of
the
dog
on
the
next
place
who
probably
got
a
strange
scent
coming
down
the
wind
as
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
hoped
for
there
he
shifted
his
position
to
the
other
side
and
as
he
came
in
range
of
the
window
he
saw
the
invalid
reclining
once
more
in
her
chair
supported
by
pillows
and
with
the
nurse
bending
over
her
well
said
bat
after
he
had
pondered
over
this
scene
for
some
time
that
seems
to
be
taps
for
the
evening
he
lingered
a
half
hour
however
thinking
there
might
be
a
possibility
of
something
more
but
as
nothing
happened
he
made
his
way
to
the
street
and
crossed
to
the
opposite
side
standing
in
the
sheltering
shadows
of
a
building
while
he
contemplated
the
burton
house
once
more
he
was
given
a
start
by
a
voice
saying
taking
a
look
at
it
eh
well
it
worth
it
i
been
here
ever
since
the
place
was
stanwick
village
and
i
ai
never
seen
goings
on
in
any
home
like
i
seen
in
that
one
the
speaker
stood
almost
at
bat
side
he
leaned
upon
a
cane
and
from
the
shaky
quality
of
his
voice
scanlon
felt
that
he
must
be
of
advanced
age
that
where
the
murder
was
done
is
it
asked
the
big
athlete
for
there
was
a
gossipy
suggestion
in
the
tone
of
the
old
man
which
made
a
show
of
of
possible
value
yes
sir
that
it
that
where
thomas
burton
was
found
dead
of
a
crushed
skull
replied
the
old
resident
that
the
house
of
his
son
and
daughter
i
see
the
father
taken
away
to
be
buried
and
i
see
the
son
taken
away
to
be
put
in
jail
and
i
see
the
daughter
doctor
coming
to
see
her
every
day
here
the
old
gentleman
broke
into
a
cackle
of
laughter
every
day
he
repeated
in
a
carriage
with
a
little
medicine
case
an
old
party
who
seems
to
have
his
wits
about
him
said
bat
to
himself
and
not
at
all
backward
about
making
a
show
of
them
i
have
a
son
continued
the
old
man
and
my
son
has
a
wife
we
live
a
little
piece
down
the
street
my
son
wife
is
fussy
she
does
like
any
kind
of
public
notice
and
so
when
i
wanted
to
go
to
the
police
with
what
i
seen
she
would
hear
of
it
she
said
we
might
even
have
our
names
in
the
papers
women
are
that
way
sometimes
said
scanlon
i
noticed
it
more
than
once
fools
i
call
them
declared
the
old
resident
but
when
they
have
control
of
things
you
got
to
let
them
have
their
way
he
stood
with
his
face
turned
toward
no
for
a
few
moments
and
then
continued
yes
sir
queer
things
go
on
in
that
house
people
that
sick
act
the
way
she
does
who
does
asked
bat
why
that
girl
over
there
every
day
stealing
away
out
at
the
back
door
with
a
veil
over
her
face
and
some
one
else
clothes
on
and
taking
a
taxicab
for
i
do
know
where
you
saw
that
did
you
asked
bat
eagerly
yes
sir
i
saw
it
and
i
seen
it
every
day
since
the
police
were
taken
off
guard
sick
again
came
the
cackling
old
laugh
sick
why
she
ai
no
more
sick
than
i
am
chapter
xxi
what
the
burglar
said
at
what
the
old
resident
of
stanwick
said
to
bat
scanlon
aroused
that
gentleman
to
a
high
pitch
and
he
began
asking
eager
questions
i
do
know
where
she
goes
said
the
man
i
wish
i
did
but
seen
her
two
or
three
times
and
she
was
just
as
spry
as
you
want
anybody
to
be
sick
sick
nothing
bat
questions
continued
for
some
time
but
this
was
the
only
fact
the
old
man
had
and
so
the
big
athlete
bade
him
scanlon
thought
it
best
not
to
go
to
the
railroad
station
for
there
he
would
be
almost
certain
to
encounter
the
swiss
and
big
slim
there
was
an
electric
road
which
cut
through
the
far
end
of
the
suburb
and
he
concluded
it
were
safer
to
use
this
into
the
city
even
though
it
did
take
much
more
time
but
everything
done
for
the
night
said
he
i
got
a
few
more
things
to
think
about
too
so
what
difference
does
a
half
hour
or
so
make
bat
got
to
bed
at
his
hotel
at
about
midnight
but
it
was
several
hours
later
before
he
got
to
sleep
for
the
events
of
the
night
tossed
and
mingled
in
his
mind
in
a
most
distracting
fashion
consequently
next
day
he
arose
late
and
when
he
reached
the
gymnasium
it
was
almost
noon
a
note
lay
upon
his
desk
in
the
office
written
in
a
hand
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
borrowing
danny
it
read
there
is
a
matter
of
some
importance
which
i
desire
to
get
at
the
bottom
of
and
a
small
boy
is
perhaps
the
best
agent
i
could
employ
keep
in
touch
with
me
jimmy
casey
who
taught
the
use
of
boxing
gloves
in
the
gymnasium
explained
the
matter
he
comes
here
in
an
awful
rush
about
ten
said
jimmy
and
wants
to
see
you
when
he
finds
out
you
ai
here
he
says
it
all
right
and
do
make
no
difference
anyhow
so
he
goes
into
the
office
and
talks
to
the
kid
and
maybe
that
kid
ai
glad
or
nothing
his
mug
looked
like
a
tin
pan
that
just
been
scoured
a
couple
of
minutes
later
they
beat
it
away
in
a
cab
it
all
right
said
scanlon
some
little
business
i
guess
all
day
bat
worked
steadily
with
his
clients
once
in
the
afternoon
he
paused
long
enough
to
call
nora
on
the
telephone
her
response
was
cheerful
indeed
she
talked
rather
gaily
of
many
things
and
he
finally
hung
up
the
receiver
with
a
wrinkle
of
discontent
between
his
brows
as
evening
came
he
took
a
shower
and
a
and
then
went
out
for
a
stroll
he
had
no
definite
notion
in
his
mind
except
that
he
wanted
fresh
air
but
somehow
his
steps
led
him
to
the
neighborhood
of
bohlmier
hotel
being
here
said
he
i
may
as
well
go
in
and
visit
the
halt
and
the
lame
i
wonder
how
much
damage
i
did
those
two
parties
maybe
i
find
them
in
their
beds
he
entered
the
office
behind
the
desk
was
the
young
man
with
the
low
collar
hello
saluted
scanlon
where
the
boss
not
feeling
right
replied
the
one
got
a
cold
i
guess
settled
in
his
throat
bat
turned
away
with
a
grin
hidden
behind
one
hand
in
the
lounging
room
of
the
place
he
looked
about
for
big
slim
not
seeing
him
he
ascended
the
stairs
and
knocked
upon
a
door
on
the
third
floor
come
in
said
the
voice
of
the
lank
burglar
bat
pushed
open
the
door
and
found
the
man
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
pulling
on
his
coat
just
run
up
to
see
if
i
could
drag
you
off
to
get
some
eats
said
bat
cordially
i
hungry
said
the
burglar
but
i
do
know
if
i
can
work
my
face
or
not
he
displayed
a
swollen
region
extending
from
his
left
eye
to
the
angle
of
his
jaw
besides
being
puffed
and
painful
looking
it
was
badly
discolored
get
that
some
bump
eh
i
should
say
yes
replied
scanlon
how
did
it
happen
last
night
stated
big
slim
i
spotted
a
fellow
in
the
dark
turned
a
trick
on
a
friend
of
mine
so
i
made
a
try
to
get
him
but
with
candor
i
did
he
got
me
tough
sympathized
bat
but
wait
maybe
you
have
your
chance
to
come
back
you
never
can
tell
big
slim
grinned
with
his
distorted
face
this
was
not
a
pleasant
sight
and
the
look
in
his
eyes
was
sly
and
wicked
i
get
back
said
he
leave
it
to
me
for
that
i
lay
him
out
so
stiff
that
a
slab
in
the
morgue
be
bent
like
a
pretzel
in
comparison
bat
looked
at
the
man
with
all
the
unrestraint
of
the
practiced
negotiator
who
is
he
he
asked
carelessly
again
the
sly
wicked
look
came
into
the
eyes
of
the
burglar
do
be
in
a
hurry
said
he
you
know
when
the
time
comes
bat
drew
in
a
deep
silent
breath
at
this
and
when
the
burglar
threw
open
the
lid
of
a
trunk
which
he
dragged
from
under
the
bed
and
took
from
the
tray
a
black
automatic
pistol
he
felt
a
tightening
of
the
scalp
but
big
slim
put
the
weapon
in
his
pocket
no
one
ever
tagged
me
out
without
me
landing
on
his
neck
declared
he
i
do
it
one
way
or
another
but
i
always
do
it
they
went
and
big
slim
led
the
way
into
a
back
room
it
was
the
same
in
which
bat
had
seen
the
swiss
playing
the
flute
on
the
night
of
nora
unaccountable
visit
but
bohlmier
was
not
at
all
musically
inclined
at
this
time
no
no
he
was
saying
to
the
young
man
i
will
nothing
to
eat
have
i
am
seek
ach
how
i
am
seek
big
slim
looked
at
scanlon
and
grinned
then
he
whispered
behind
his
hand
he
was
in
on
the
same
lot
of
treatment
the
guy
got
him
before
he
did
me
then
to
bohlmier
he
added
how
the
sore
throat
bad
replied
the
swiss
in
a
strained
way
i
a
doctor
haf
had
he
said
i
was
lucky
that
i
was
not
killed
well
you
was
said
big
slim
so
forget
that
part
of
it
the
eyes
of
bohlmier
with
a
glare
in
them
went
to
bat
then
he
motioned
to
the
burglar
who
bent
over
his
chair
the
swiss
whispered
croakingly
in
the
other
ear
bat
could
get
a
word
here
and
there
but
not
sufficient
to
make
any
sense
of
what
was
being
said
once
or
twice
he
saw
the
eyes
of
the
two
men
turn
upon
him
and
their
eager
expression
deadly
and
cunning
made
him
uneasy
sure
he
heard
big
slim
say
that
right
i
did
miss
that
trick
then
the
whispering
resumed
he
caught
fragments
such
as
get
him
down
there
gaffney
i
fix
him
all
right
who
me
said
bat
to
himself
shifting
uneasily
from
one
foot
to
the
other
do
they
really
know
i
the
party
who
put
them
on
the
hospital
list
and
are
they
framing
it
right
under
my
nose
to
get
even
he
had
heard
of
such
things
before
the
fate
of
a
victim
planned
in
his
hearing
and
he
never
the
wiser
for
it
but
he
hunched
his
great
shoulders
and
nodded
his
head
there
were
victims
and
victims
and
if
they
tried
to
lead
him
into
anything
he
resolved
to
do
his
best
to
prove
to
them
that
it
was
not
a
sheep
they
were
handling
i
make
the
proceedings
much
more
interesting
than
last
night
he
promised
himself
there
was
no
up
then
this
time
there
be
plenty
of
it
in
a
few
moments
more
the
burglar
turned
to
bat
bohlmier
wants
us
to
go
down
and
see
a
friend
of
ours
said
he
after
we
get
some
feed
you
know
sure
said
bat
readily
anything
to
be
sociable
they
nodded
to
the
swiss
who
sat
following
them
with
inflamed
eyes
as
they
left
the
room
their
journey
through
the
dirty
streets
to
joey
loo
was
a
silent
one
and
as
they
entered
the
underground
place
and
seated
themselves
the
silence
was
unbroken
one
of
the
detached
fragments
which
scanlon
had
caught
a
few
minutes
before
kept
recurring
to
him
gaffney
flashed
and
reflashed
through
his
mind
he
paid
no
attention
to
it
at
first
but
the
mere
repetition
of
the
name
finally
claimed
his
attention
gaffney
he
considered
it
thoughtfully
as
big
slim
talked
to
the
chinaman
who
came
to
serve
them
why
yes
did
i
hear
that
name
somewhere
before
and
not
so
long
ago
unless
i
much
mistaken
he
pondered
but
where
he
had
heard
it
refused
to
come
back
and
so
he
dismissed
it
from
his
mind
he
gave
his
order
to
the
stolid
oriental
and
then
looking
about
the
place
said
to
his
companion
funny
looking
crowd
eh
big
slim
allowed
his
eyes
to
flit
about
from
one
pale
hollow
face
to
another
there
enough
to
start
a
party
right
here
if
you
had
the
stuff
said
he
i
could
pick
you
out
twenty
customers
without
making
a
mistake
it
beats
booze
that
stuff
said
bat
i
seen
some
tough
examples
of
how
it
worked
great
business
said
big
slim
a
covetous
glint
in
his
eyes
big
money
in
it
i
like
to
raise
a
nice
stake
and
get
hold
of
a
lot
of
i
bet
i
take
in
more
real
change
than
a
gambling
house
stick
to
cracking
cribs
begged
bat
it
got
more
stuff
in
it
for
a
man
with
nerve
listen
said
the
lank
burglar
as
he
leaned
across
the
table
using
your
nerve
all
the
time
ai
what
they
tell
you
it
is
nerve
ai
with
you
always
and
when
it
all
warped
and
faded
with
hard
usage
all
you
get
if
you
ca
buy
more
and
you
ca
patch
up
the
old
what
are
you
going
to
do
so
why
not
a
corner
in
the
dope
market
as
an
easy
graft
it
do
listen
good
said
bat
positively
i
rather
get
a
big
name
for
opening
babies
banks
it
would
sting
so
much
you
a
regular
particular
guy
ai
you
big
slim
had
a
disagreeable
grin
on
his
mouth
and
eyed
scanlon
attentively
you
must
have
been
well
brought
up
they
ate
their
food
in
comparative
silence
when
it
was
brought
and
as
soon
as
they
had
finished
the
burglar
pushed
back
his
chair
let
get
down
to
gaffney
said
he
he
put
his
hand
to
his
swollen
face
as
they
arose
i
got
a
little
trick
to
turn
the
streets
were
crowded
with
a
mass
of
cheap
pleasure
seekers
the
burlesque
theatres
and
motion
picture
places
were
besieged
with
throngs
from
the
open
fronts
of
auction
houses
the
strident
voices
of
the
auctioneers
rose
in
feeling
appeals
that
every
one
grasp
the
opportunities
offered
store
show
keepers
stood
upon
high
narrow
platforms
draped
all
about
with
canvases
upon
which
were
painted
monstrous
errors
of
nature
and
wonders
fresh
from
lands
there
was
a
smell
of
uncleaned
corners
and
open
drains
the
very
mud
of
the
streets
held
a
greasy
quality
which
made
the
unaccustomed
passer
shudder
a
little
and
make
haste
and
upon
all
this
was
thrown
the
glitter
of
many
lights
from
iron
poles
they
hung
in
huge
white
domes
windows
filled
with
flashy
merchandise
blazed
with
clusters
of
them
reeking
alleys
were
exposed
by
the
glare
of
their
hanging
lights
as
is
a
poisonous
sac
by
the
scalpel
of
the
surgeon
illuminated
signs
of
all
sorts
glared
at
one
some
were
lurid
and
stationary
others
again
flowed
about
in
never
ending
contortions
making
grotesque
and
proclamations
gaffney
round
here
somewhere
asked
bat
after
they
had
walked
through
the
district
for
some
little
time
just
off
here
a
little
ways
replied
the
burglar
they
turned
a
corner
under
the
lee
of
a
glaring
saloon
and
found
themselves
in
a
small
street
which
lay
like
a
off
that
thronged
avenue
there
it
is
now
bat
saw
a
place
with
the
name
gaffney
painted
in
red
letters
upon
the
window
and
two
billiard
cues
in
yellow
crossed
beneath
it
they
entered
and
were
greeted
by
a
babble
of
voices
an
incessant
clicking
of
balls
and
the
thick
odor
of
poor
tobacco
here
and
there
games
of
more
than
ordinary
interest
were
going
on
the
principals
were
as
a
rule
young
men
who
wore
no
coats
and
staked
their
handling
of
their
cues
against
the
world
for
a
living
small
crowds
were
gathered
about
these
contests
the
shots
were
and
of
great
precision
lining
the
walls
were
rows
of
men
some
with
vacant
faces
others
alert
and
predatory
and
as
bat
looked
about
he
noted
what
he
had
noted
in
such
places
many
times
before
a
for
quitters
and
a
for
yeggs
he
thought
there
more
good
time
wasted
in
places
like
this
and
more
crooked
deeds
hatched
than
would
put
a
roof
over
lake
michigan
with
big
slim
he
took
a
station
at
the
far
end
of
the
place
here
and
there
was
a
doorway
opening
into
a
smaller
room
and
in
which
more
tables
were
erected
get
that
fellow
with
the
curly
mop
said
the
burglar
indicating
this
doorway
inside
there
a
man
in
his
with
a
remarkably
high
collar
and
a
shock
of
curling
and
very
dark
hair
was
arranging
the
balls
at
one
of
the
inner
tables
the
shirt
sleeves
were
loudly
striped
and
the
curling
hair
was
arranged
in
ornamental
waves
of
which
he
seemed
very
vain
for
as
bat
watched
he
saw
the
man
gaze
into
a
specked
mirror
and
pass
a
hand
carefully
over
them
he
looks
like
the
beginning
of
a
parade
said
bat
who
is
he
name
hutchinson
and
he
runs
this
place
for
gaffney
replied
big
slim
and
here
he
grinned
and
pulled
at
his
bony
fingers
until
they
cracked
he
a
very
intimate
friend
of
a
friend
of
mine
that
so
scanlon
looked
at
the
man
reflectively
and
tried
to
think
what
possible
bearing
this
could
have
on
the
matter
which
interested
him
as
far
as
he
was
able
to
see
it
had
none
but
somehow
the
name
gaffney
once
more
became
active
in
his
mind
and
this
troubled
him
it
because
it
painted
on
everything
around
the
place
reasoned
bat
the
walls
and
the
cue
racks
have
it
and
as
i
stand
here
i
can
see
it
done
backwards
on
the
front
window
gaffney
means
nothing
in
my
young
life
so
what
is
his
name
bumping
around
in
my
head
for
and
then
just
as
he
was
on
the
verge
of
banishing
it
from
his
thoughts
a
solution
of
the
name
persistence
flashed
upon
him
it
had
been
used
by
dennison
that
day
at
the
polo
club
he
had
called
it
after
as
they
were
leaving
that
it
was
bat
mute
exclamation
that
it
it
was
dennison
he
was
telling
us
of
how
the
bounder
said
he
was
to
meet
some
one
an
party
dennison
thought
to
arrange
a
little
matter
of
business
and
the
meeting
was
to
be
at
gaffney
the
big
athlete
thrilled
at
the
idea
was
it
possible
that
this
obscure
place
was
the
one
meant
but
why
not
it
was
just
the
sort
of
establishment
the
bounder
would
have
selected
for
a
meeting
with
a
crony
of
the
underworld
and
it
was
possible
too
that
a
friend
of
a
friend
of
yours
said
bat
to
the
man
at
his
side
well
he
might
be
all
right
in
spite
of
his
looks
he
used
to
deal
faro
at
danforth
place
on
the
avenue
said
big
slim
but
he
down
and
out
maybe
with
another
grin
he
tried
the
game
himself
sometimes
they
do
said
bat
but
it
like
opening
the
door
of
an
elevator
shaft
and
walking
through
he
great
pals
with
a
fellow
named
fenton
said
big
slim
as
he
said
this
one
hand
went
to
his
coat
pocket
in
a
caressing
sort
of
gesture
and
bat
realized
with
a
ray
of
comprehension
that
this
was
the
pocket
into
which
the
burglar
had
slipped
the
black
automatic
they
like
a
couple
of
brothers
i
see
said
bat
a
league
of
two
eh
well
that
nice
it
makes
it
handy
for
people
who
might
want
to
see
either
of
them
find
one
and
you
sure
of
the
other
big
slim
nursed
the
concealed
weapon
and
grinned
disagreeably
hutchinson
here
said
he
and
so
i
sure
fenton
be
here
and
fenton
the
party
i
want
to
meet
up
with
i
notice
observed
bat
with
a
downward
nod
that
you
are
coddling
your
some
and
so
i
take
it
that
this
fellow
fenton
and
yourself
ai
on
good
terms
right
said
the
burglar
readily
a
good
guess
we
ai
he
took
the
hand
from
the
pocket
and
pointed
to
his
swollen
face
it
was
fenton
done
that
said
he
and
it
was
him
that
almost
done
for
bohlmier
the
eyes
of
the
big
athlete
blinked
rapidly
at
this
and
he
wanted
to
laugh
but
he
did
not
so
said
he
i
get
you
it
was
fenton
who
decorated
you
with
that
well
well
he
looked
at
the
other
speculatively
and
added
but
i
thought
you
said
it
was
dark
how
did
you
know
him
who
else
would
be
hanging
around
there
demanded
big
slim
almost
savagely
nobody
else
in
the
world
hanging
around
where
asked
bat
innocently
upon
the
point
of
replying
the
burglar
checked
himself
it
do
make
any
difference
where
he
said
i
got
this
on
him
all
right
there
was
a
pause
between
them
for
a
few
moments
filled
with
the
of
the
balls
the
comments
of
the
spectators
and
the
fervent
ejaculations
of
the
players
then
big
slim
said
in
an
altered
tone
say
you
put
that
thing
over
pretty
slick
on
allen
that
night
at
duke
sheehan
how
you
like
to
take
on
a
job
of
slugging
this
guy
this
fenton
party
yes
he
bigger
than
i
am
just
as
allen
was
and
it
be
a
bad
chance
if
i
him
scanlon
realized
instantly
that
if
he
refused
the
man
proposition
there
would
be
a
blur
in
their
relationship
and
this
might
prevent
the
unfolding
of
several
things
which
he
felt
must
be
unfolded
so
he
replied
without
hesitation
let
have
a
look
at
him
if
he
comes
in
a
table
became
vacant
in
the
back
room
in
a
few
minutes
and
bat
and
the
burglar
took
possession
of
it
they
had
played
for
about
a
half
hour
when
big
slim
in
a
journey
about
the
table
apparently
to
survey
the
balls
from
a
new
angle
said
to
scanlon
in
a
low
tone
spot
the
fellow
with
the
broken
nose
talking
to
hutchinson
him
while
the
burglar
sighted
and
prepared
for
a
difficult
shot
bat
took
occasion
to
inspect
the
man
in
question
he
had
just
entered
and
seemed
rather
breathless
a
cap
was
fitted
down
upon
his
head
he
wore
no
overcoat
and
his
coat
collar
was
turned
up
while
the
garment
was
buttoned
tightly
about
him
though
only
about
middle
size
he
was
strongly
built
and
had
a
rugged
enduring
look
his
one
prominent
feature
was
his
nose
this
had
been
broken
at
some
time
or
other
and
seemed
absolutely
boneless
and
flat
i
got
him
said
bat
there
no
two
noses
like
that
anywhere
fenton
talked
rapidly
to
hutchinson
he
had
the
eager
manner
of
a
man
who
bore
tidings
of
an
unusual
nature
his
gestures
were
short
and
expressive
of
subconscious
restraint
the
manager
of
the
pool
room
stood
listening
a
look
of
stupefaction
upon
his
face
and
as
bat
watched
he
put
out
his
hand
and
touched
the
other
as
though
to
assure
himself
that
the
situation
was
a
reality
and
not
a
thing
of
the
imagination
then
he
emerged
from
his
dazed
state
becoming
immediately
alert
he
said
something
to
fenton
in
a
quick
nervous
sort
of
way
and
the
man
with
the
broken
nose
stopped
at
once
in
his
eager
career
yet
with
all
the
indications
remaining
of
one
who
ached
to
disburden
himself
hutchinson
placed
the
care
of
the
tables
in
the
hands
of
a
boy
who
assisted
him
and
then
went
with
fenton
to
a
far
corner
where
the
disfigured
one
recommenced
his
interrupted
communication
that
guy
lucky
to
get
away
with
a
plain
beating
remarked
big
slim
as
he
chalked
his
cue
for
i
got
something
on
him
something
strong
that
so
said
scanlon
as
he
surveyed
the
array
of
balls
on
the
table
with
a
great
deal
of
assumed
attention
remember
what
i
told
you
about
the
woman
and
the
i
meant
to
lift
oh
yes
said
bat
without
a
quiver
and
the
husband
that
beat
you
to
it
the
husband
was
croaked
that
night
said
big
slim
tossing
the
chalk
upon
a
window
ledge
and
fenton
is
the
guy
who
did
it
chapter
xxii
what
danny
saw
at
bat
scanlon
touched
the
cue
ball
deftly
the
ball
it
struck
broke
away
at
a
sharp
angle
and
vanished
into
a
pocket
i
getting
case
hardened
was
the
big
athlete
mental
comment
a
day
or
two
ago
this
news
would
have
rocked
me
to
the
foundations
now
i
not
even
jarred
but
as
he
straightened
up
he
said
to
the
burglar
so
friend
husband
went
out
under
the
care
of
the
lad
with
the
concave
face
well
well
that
is
some
startling
tidings
i
could
send
him
to
the
chair
if
i
wanted
to
said
big
slim
longingly
but
i
never
hook
up
with
the
for
anything
so
just
either
him
or
you
slug
him
whichever
way
it
turns
out
keep
the
gun
hid
advised
bat
you
ca
get
away
with
that
stuff
i
take
this
fellow
on
and
in
a
morning
or
two
you
hear
how
holding
down
a
bed
in
a
neighboring
hospital
with
enough
bruises
and
contusions
to
fill
a
peach
basket
all
right
said
big
slim
grinning
appreciatively
the
job
in
your
hands
do
be
too
long
for
bohlmier
waiting
and
it
was
his
idea
in
the
first
place
it
might
come
off
in
an
hour
who
knows
said
bat
but
with
a
glance
at
fenton
it
does
seem
a
pity
to
crush
all
that
enthusiasm
he
must
be
happier
at
this
minute
than
he
been
for
years
the
man
excitement
seemed
to
increase
he
talked
with
many
gestures
now
and
then
he
laughed
in
a
delighted
sort
of
way
and
slapped
hutchinson
on
the
shoulder
the
latter
smoothed
his
waved
hair
and
looked
vastly
interested
now
and
then
when
an
opportunity
came
in
fenton
flood
of
talk
he
asked
a
question
and
after
each
answer
he
seemed
to
advance
a
key
toward
the
high
pitch
of
the
other
in
a
second
or
two
remarked
bat
in
a
low
voice
he
be
rumpling
his
hair
and
if
he
ever
does
that
he
never
get
over
it
for
at
least
a
half
hour
the
talk
went
on
between
the
two
at
the
finish
hutchinson
was
quite
as
excited
as
fenton
it
a
pipe
bat
heard
him
declare
in
an
exultant
tone
a
regular
pipe
all
we
got
to
do
is
to
here
the
voice
sank
and
he
went
on
his
hands
clutching
fenton
arms
in
a
strong
grip
the
intense
eagerness
of
the
two
the
excitement
which
one
had
imparted
to
the
other
interested
bat
so
many
curious
and
unaccountable
things
had
happened
of
late
that
he
had
gotten
into
the
habit
of
looking
for
them
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
he
separated
even
ordinary
occurrences
from
the
matter
which
had
been
so
growing
in
his
mind
it
might
be
so
ran
his
thought
that
this
incident
had
its
place
in
the
chain
he
had
seen
making
a
tangled
hopeless
chain
to
him
without
beginning
or
end
but
then
again
and
it
a
thousand
to
one
against
it
might
be
nothing
at
all
was
bat
next
judgment
i
getting
all
mixed
in
my
signals
and
here
he
became
aware
that
big
slim
was
talking
to
him
the
burglar
had
run
the
game
out
and
had
put
away
his
cue
as
you
taken
on
this
thing
for
me
he
was
saying
i
going
across
the
river
to
look
up
some
prospects
all
right
said
bat
nodding
go
ahead
i
stick
around
a
while
with
a
wink
and
a
gesture
of
the
thumb
toward
fenton
big
slim
went
away
bat
carelessly
stepped
nearer
to
the
two
men
and
seemed
greatly
interested
in
a
racing
chart
posted
upon
the
wall
i
told
you
there
was
a
chance
fenton
was
saying
did
i
i
knew
the
thing
would
pull
up
at
quigley
some
time
or
another
did
i
i
did
think
much
of
it
said
hutchinson
with
the
air
of
one
who
was
wrong
and
is
quite
delighted
with
his
bigness
in
acknowledging
it
but
i
can
see
now
that
i
did
look
at
it
right
leave
it
to
me
said
fenton
smiling
expansively
little
tricks
like
this
are
right
in
my
line
and
now
i
tell
you
what
we
do
we
but
hutchinson
stopped
him
wait
said
he
do
be
in
a
rush
this
ai
the
kind
of
a
thing
to
hurry
through
you
got
to
take
your
time
you
got
to
think
it
out
the
man
seemed
impressed
by
both
the
manner
and
the
words
of
the
other
and
noting
this
hutchinson
went
on
sleep
on
it
that
a
good
way
and
i
do
the
same
then
i
run
in
to
your
place
afternoon
and
we
can
put
your
ideas
into
good
shape
fenton
seemed
to
consider
this
quite
a
sober
steadying
notion
and
after
a
few
moments
more
of
conversation
the
man
with
the
ornamental
hair
went
back
to
the
superintending
of
his
pool
tables
and
the
other
took
his
departure
bat
followed
him
the
big
athlete
was
not
at
all
sure
but
that
big
slim
would
be
lurking
somewhere
outside
in
order
to
see
if
he
made
any
move
to
carry
out
his
promise
against
fenton
and
to
be
seen
close
upon
the
trail
of
the
man
would
be
excellent
testimony
of
his
good
faith
and
then
he
told
himself
as
he
went
along
fenton
in
plain
sight
i
want
to
locate
this
party
anyway
it
will
be
useful
in
the
fenton
stepped
out
of
the
little
in
which
gaffney
place
lay
and
into
the
full
flood
of
the
glittering
avenue
here
there
was
a
danger
of
losing
him
in
the
press
and
bat
increased
his
speed
working
his
way
nearer
to
his
quarry
in
a
few
blocks
there
was
another
turn
this
time
into
an
unfrequented
street
which
had
a
familiar
look
bat
fell
back
here
and
took
to
the
opposite
side
holding
close
to
the
buildings
and
walking
upon
the
balls
of
his
feet
so
as
to
avoid
the
usual
ringing
heel
strokes
at
the
mouth
of
an
alley
fenton
slackened
his
speed
and
then
disappeared
bat
from
the
other
side
of
the
street
inspected
the
place
with
mouth
twisted
awry
i
got
it
said
he
that
the
alley
i
slipped
into
the
night
i
tagged
after
bohlmier
and
his
pal
and
in
the
said
alley
is
located
the
house
they
went
into
i
wonder
and
here
he
stroked
his
jaw
if
this
fellow
with
the
broken
nose
has
anything
to
do
with
the
room
they
broke
into
through
the
wall
the
more
he
considered
this
point
the
more
likely
it
seemed
to
be
true
and
if
it
were
then
had
known
of
fenton
long
since
yes
he
was
onto
him
mused
scanlon
his
thoughts
turning
to
that
night
meeting
with
the
disguised
investigator
in
the
same
building
kirk
had
him
spotted
he
lingered
for
some
time
looking
into
the
gloom
of
the
alley
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
nothing
further
could
be
done
there
and
that
a
great
deal
might
be
done
somewhere
else
instantly
he
started
along
the
street
heading
for
the
same
cab
stand
which
and
himself
had
patronized
on
the
night
of
which
he
had
just
been
thinking
here
he
secured
a
taxi
and
in
a
short
time
drew
up
at
the
investigator
door
stumph
admitted
him
and
as
he
mounted
the
stairs
toward
the
study
he
heard
the
voice
of
hello
glad
to
see
you
the
investigator
greeted
him
with
a
do
you
know
that
your
office
staff
is
also
here
danny
said
bat
no
is
he
what
the
idea
came
to
make
a
report
i
suppose
did
you
get
my
note
saying
i
had
borrowed
him
for
a
while
oh
yes
said
bat
that
so
he
followed
the
other
into
the
study
and
there
they
saw
danny
his
red
hair
glowing
under
the
lights
and
deep
in
the
pages
of
some
illustrated
papers
but
he
got
up
and
stood
looking
at
his
employer
with
a
grin
hello
scanlon
said
he
i
hope
you
ai
mad
or
nothin
for
my
going
away
and
leaving
the
office
i
explained
all
that
danny
said
and
bat
nodded
and
now
let
hear
what
you
have
to
tell
i
tried
to
get
you
on
the
telephone
an
hour
ago
said
danny
as
they
all
three
sat
down
at
the
table
maybe
it
was
longer
than
that
but
stumph
said
you
was
in
and
then
i
told
him
i
was
coming
around
to
wait
till
you
got
here
quite
right
smiled
the
crime
specialist
approvingly
when
we
left
the
office
danny
told
scanlon
we
took
a
taxi
and
we
went
to
the
chandler
building
and
up
on
the
sixteenth
floor
we
went
into
an
office
which
was
empty
told
me
i
was
to
stay
there
and
was
to
watch
things
that
happened
in
the
place
across
the
hall
a
sort
of
speculator
in
precious
stones
said
to
bat
he
buys
and
sells
and
his
buying
is
not
always
aboveboard
he
is
also
a
pawnbroker
in
a
large
way
i
see
said
bat
there
is
a
glass
in
the
door
of
the
place
proceeded
danny
eagerly
glass
that
you
can
see
through
and
i
could
look
through
the
keyhole
of
the
office
i
was
in
right
into
mr
quigley
quigley
said
bat
anxiously
for
this
was
the
name
he
had
caught
in
the
excited
conversation
between
fenton
and
hutchinson
that
the
name
of
the
man
who
keeps
the
diamond
place
danny
informed
him
there
was
little
boxes
like
stalls
right
up
at
a
counter
and
all
with
doors
on
them
people
went
into
these
and
then
nobody
could
see
who
they
were
quigley
would
stand
back
of
the
counter
and
talk
to
them
you
could
see
all
right
and
the
safe
where
he
keeps
his
money
and
watches
and
things
there
was
a
good
many
people
went
in
some
of
them
ladies
and
i
thought
i
get
a
sore
eye
from
peeping
through
the
keyhole
but
there
was
anybody
to
like
the
one
you
told
me
about
you
are
sure
asked
the
investigator
now
wait
begged
danny
who
had
no
desire
to
spoil
the
effect
of
his
story
by
at
noon
time
the
waiter
from
the
lunch
place
came
up
and
handed
me
in
the
eats
you
said
he
would
while
i
was
feeding
myself
i
stood
up
close
to
the
door
so
i
could
hear
if
any
one
stopped
at
the
shop
across
the
way
if
they
did
then
i
did
have
to
peep
a
good
idea
approved
so
that
what
i
done
after
that
said
danny
when
i
heard
anybody
open
quigley
door
i
looked
out
to
see
if
it
was
the
lady
you
wanted
after
a
while
i
heard
somebody
walk
down
the
hall
and
stop
outside
my
door
they
did
go
in
at
the
diamond
place
and
they
did
go
on
along
down
the
hall
so
i
peeped
to
see
who
it
was
i
knowed
it
would
be
a
man
because
he
walked
so
heavy
but
he
stood
so
close
up
to
my
door
that
i
could
see
only
a
piece
of
his
back
after
a
bit
though
he
got
across
the
hall
and
i
had
a
good
shot
at
him
he
was
kind
of
bent
over
and
was
looking
into
quigley
too
while
he
was
there
i
heard
somebody
else
coming
and
this
time
it
was
a
lady
because
she
came
like
ladies
do
with
their
high
heels
and
as
soon
as
he
heard
the
noise
the
man
at
the
door
of
the
diamond
place
beat
it
along
the
hall
in
a
hurry
and
then
the
lady
went
into
quigley
what
sort
of
a
lady
asked
i
do
know
replied
danny
apologetically
she
had
a
veil
on
that
covered
over
her
face
but
she
was
a
young
lady
i
could
see
that
by
her
dress
and
her
shoes
and
her
hat
she
went
into
one
of
the
little
stalls
and
quigley
commenced
to
talk
to
her
and
then
the
man
who
had
been
looking
in
at
the
door
came
back
and
began
to
look
in
again
only
this
time
he
seemed
like
he
was
excited
about
something
he
was
afraid
to
stand
up
and
look
straight
in
like
he
did
before
he
only
peeped
in
at
one
edge
and
so
i
could
see
in
too
after
quigley
talked
to
the
lady
a
while
i
seen
her
hands
with
gloves
on
them
reach
out
of
the
stall
toward
him
and
they
had
a
necklace
in
them
that
i
bet
was
diamonds
a
necklace
was
that
all
i
did
see
anything
else
so
they
talked
about
it
for
a
long
while
a
couple
of
times
quigley
give
it
back
to
her
and
shook
his
head
like
as
if
he
did
want
to
give
that
much
money
for
it
but
she
always
got
it
back
to
him
and
then
he
put
the
necklace
in
the
safe
and
gave
her
some
money
the
man
that
was
looking
in
at
the
door
blew
away
again
as
the
lady
came
out
she
still
had
her
veil
on
and
as
she
went
up
the
hall
i
opened
the
door
making
believe
i
was
just
going
out
on
an
errand
or
something
for
my
boss
and
when
i
got
in
the
hall
i
seen
the
man
come
from
around
a
corner
and
stare
after
the
lady
like
as
if
she
was
the
only
one
in
the
world
did
you
notice
anything
about
this
man
that
would
make
you
know
him
again
if
you
saw
him
asked
sure
said
danny
i
know
him
all
right
he
got
a
broken
nose
the
flattest
one
i
ever
saw
chapter
xxiii
a
woman
when
danny
made
this
declaration
scanlon
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
drew
a
long
breath
of
mingled
surprise
and
satisfaction
so
that
had
been
the
subject
of
fenton
excited
consultation
with
hutchinson
a
diamond
necklace
pawned
or
sold
by
a
woman
and
from
fenton
own
words
it
was
a
thing
he
had
been
expecting
bat
was
about
to
break
into
a
detailed
account
of
all
he
had
seen
and
heard
since
his
last
conversation
with
the
investigator
but
was
closely
questioning
danny
so
the
big
man
held
his
peace
finally
the
office
boy
had
told
all
he
knew
and
departed
then
bat
comfortably
settled
back
in
his
chair
spoke
a
fellow
eh
said
he
name
of
fenton
i
think
he
saw
the
keen
eyes
of
the
other
flash
him
a
look
it
was
the
first
surprise
scanlon
had
noted
in
since
the
hunt
began
and
it
filled
him
with
immense
satisfaction
he
reached
for
a
cigar
and
lighted
it
carefully
lives
in
a
tenement
house
off
on
the
other
end
of
town
said
he
after
he
had
the
cigar
going
well
the
same
house
where
i
ran
across
you
remember
laughed
you
are
coming
on
said
he
maybe
nodded
the
big
athlete
a
little
faster
than
you
think
even
now
i
had
a
few
things
happen
to
me
in
the
last
hours
that
have
lots
of
ginger
in
them
and
so
pausing
now
and
then
to
draw
at
his
cigar
he
related
all
that
had
occurred
both
on
that
night
and
the
night
before
listened
with
careful
attention
and
when
bat
had
finished
he
said
you
appear
to
have
had
quite
a
time
of
it
i
am
obliged
to
you
for
some
of
the
points
you
have
made
they
throw
light
upon
corners
which
up
to
now
have
been
rather
obscure
what
worries
me
said
bat
is
that
but
the
investigator
stopped
him
to
worry
in
a
matter
like
this
is
to
admit
that
you
are
jumping
at
conclusions
said
and
that
only
so
to
speak
clouds
the
water
it
makes
it
almost
impossible
to
see
any
distance
ahead
and
spoils
one
judgment
of
what
is
already
in
one
hand
there
was
a
short
pause
and
then
the
speaker
went
on
i
grew
somewhat
interested
in
gaffney
place
at
once
upon
hearing
dennison
speak
of
it
that
afternoon
at
the
polo
club
after
assuming
the
disguise
you
saw
me
in
i
went
there
and
engaged
in
a
game
at
one
of
the
tables
inside
of
an
hour
i
had
the
information
that
the
bounder
had
occasionally
visited
the
place
and
always
to
meet
a
man
of
the
name
of
fenton
fenton
was
in
the
rooms
at
the
time
and
when
he
went
home
i
trailed
him
i
rented
the
room
almost
across
the
hall
from
his
with
the
same
idea
in
my
mind
as
that
of
your
friend
the
burglar
i
got
that
at
the
time
spoke
bat
scanlon
but
what
the
idea
there
were
diamonds
in
question
said
the
diamonds
tom
burton
took
from
nora
cavanaugh
it
occurred
to
me
after
considering
the
matter
carefully
that
fenton
might
have
them
in
his
possession
but
my
search
of
his
room
just
finished
as
bohlmier
and
big
slim
arrived
showed
me
that
they
were
not
kept
there
at
least
this
whole
business
about
those
diamonds
sounds
kind
of
funny
to
me
said
bat
nora
told
her
maid
she
put
them
away
in
a
bank
vault
how
do
you
know
she
did
recover
them
in
some
way
and
do
just
that
very
thing
pressed
one
of
the
series
of
call
bells
that
brings
us
to
a
point
upon
which
i
think
we
can
expect
definite
intelligence
said
he
in
a
few
moments
fuller
appeared
dapper
and
alert
how
soon
will
you
be
ready
to
make
a
report
upon
the
matter
you
have
been
working
up
asked
the
investigator
right
away
replied
fuller
as
he
spread
some
typewritten
papers
upon
the
table
i
put
it
on
the
machine
while
i
was
waiting
to
speak
to
you
took
up
the
sheets
and
his
eyes
ran
quickly
over
them
this
is
about
what
i
expected
said
he
finally
you
are
sure
you
missed
no
one
quite
sure
i
first
called
on
those
banks
and
trust
companies
which
i
fancied
miss
cavanaugh
did
business
with
she
had
an
account
in
several
but
she
had
no
box
in
the
safety
deposit
vault
and
she
had
deposited
nothing
save
money
i
went
from
one
bank
to
another
some
of
them
were
disinclined
to
give
any
information
but
when
they
were
convinced
it
was
police
business
they
answered
my
questions
the
result
then
is
that
miss
cavanaugh
did
deposit
anything
in
the
vaults
of
any
bank
in
the
city
she
did
not
replied
fuller
positively
the
investigator
looked
at
scanlon
and
the
big
man
nodded
his
head
gravely
all
right
said
he
that
settled
and
now
what
comes
next
from
what
you
have
told
me
and
from
what
danny
has
said
replied
i
rather
think
a
little
talk
with
fenton
would
not
be
out
of
place
good
said
bat
first
continued
the
investigator
we
see
what
to
be
had
from
his
friend
hutchinson
i
rather
of
the
opinion
that
he
has
some
information
which
would
be
of
use
to
us
they
rose
and
as
they
put
on
hats
and
coats
said
to
fuller
perhaps
you
better
come
along
fuller
if
things
go
as
i
think
they
will
we
are
in
for
a
rather
busy
night
and
may
need
your
help
the
three
boarded
a
street
car
not
far
from
the
investigator
house
after
they
had
alighted
a
walk
of
ten
minutes
brought
them
to
place
remain
within
call
said
to
his
aide
we
may
need
you
at
any
moment
right
said
the
young
man
readily
i
be
somewhere
about
scanlon
pushed
open
gaffney
door
and
entered
followed
by
the
place
was
crowded
the
air
was
thick
with
the
smoke
of
poor
tobacco
the
young
men
still
made
the
skilful
strokes
at
the
tables
and
the
walls
were
lined
as
usual
with
men
who
either
stared
vacantly
or
scowled
with
predatory
longing
hutchinson
with
his
striped
sleeves
and
his
carefully
waved
hair
was
in
the
back
room
engaged
with
an
exceptionally
clever
gentleman
who
made
shot
after
shot
of
almost
miraculous
character
and
scanlon
waited
until
the
game
was
run
through
then
the
former
touched
hutchinson
upon
the
arm
could
we
have
a
word
with
you
asked
the
investigator
certainly
hutchinson
smiled
agreeably
of
course
they
took
him
aside
and
looked
him
steadily
in
the
face
while
he
said
we
like
to
ask
a
question
or
two
about
a
friend
of
yours
fenton
hutchinson
smiled
once
more
still
agreeably
but
with
a
little
less
genuineness
oh
joe
said
he
yes
an
old
pal
of
mine
what
about
him
he
comes
in
to
see
you
quite
frequently
does
he
why
yes
pretty
often
hutchinson
hand
smoothed
at
the
waves
of
hair
and
through
the
smile
showed
evidences
of
trouble
but
then
most
of
the
boys
come
in
often
it
quite
a
for
most
of
them
but
refused
to
consider
this
last
fenton
often
met
people
here
i
think
said
he
his
keen
eyes
still
fixed
upon
the
other
people
who
wanted
to
see
him
in
the
way
of
business
why
no
said
hutchinson
no
i
never
knew
joe
to
meet
a
soul
there
was
an
acquaintance
of
his
named
burton
tom
burton
sometimes
called
the
bounder
who
called
here
at
times
to
talk
to
him
hutchinson
smile
disappeared
completely
and
a
glassy
look
came
into
his
eyes
one
night
just
a
week
ago
burton
came
here
he
had
some
trouble
with
fenton
some
hours
later
he
was
found
murdered
hutchinson
gasped
brokenly
reaching
out
one
trembling
hand
he
touched
sleeve
i
did
have
anything
to
do
with
that
he
said
i
did
know
anything
about
it
even
until
i
saw
it
in
the
papers
on
the
day
after
you
know
something
about
it
said
so
suppose
you
tell
us
but
wait
a
new
thought
apparently
occurring
to
him
first
call
up
fenton
and
get
him
here
we
want
to
talk
to
him
too
but
i
do
know
where
he
he
at
home
said
briefly
and
there
is
a
telephone
in
the
hall
not
a
dozen
yards
from
his
room
this
precision
was
too
much
for
hutchinson
so
he
went
with
scared
face
to
a
telephone
at
one
side
and
asked
for
a
number
the
talk
between
the
two
men
had
been
carried
on
in
low
tones
none
of
the
players
at
the
table
was
aware
of
its
nature
there
was
a
slight
delay
in
procuring
the
number
asked
for
but
finally
a
small
inquiring
voice
was
heard
i
want
to
speak
to
fenton
said
hutchinson
get
him
on
the
will
you
the
small
voice
seemed
protesting
but
hutchinson
urged
persistently
well
what
if
he
is
in
bed
this
is
important
kick
on
his
door
tell
him
hutchinson
wants
to
speak
to
him
right
away
there
was
a
delay
much
longer
than
the
first
then
another
small
voice
came
over
the
wire
get
a
move
on
you
said
hutchinson
i
want
you
here
right
away
a
couple
of
people
want
to
meet
you
important
of
course
it
is
would
i
be
dragging
you
out
of
bed
if
it
was
after
a
little
more
of
the
same
style
of
urging
hutchinson
hung
up
and
turned
to
he
be
here
in
ten
minutes
said
he
very
good
said
the
investigator
the
three
walked
to
the
corner
they
had
occupied
before
and
the
speaker
went
on
i
see
you
understand
this
is
a
serious
matter
and
so
nothing
but
straightforward
answers
are
expected
of
you
joe
a
pal
of
mine
said
the
manager
but
i
do
know
nothing
about
his
affairs
if
he
in
on
croaking
this
guy
i
do
know
anything
about
it
i
on
the
level
and
we
are
not
greatly
interested
in
that
said
what
we
want
just
now
is
information
as
to
what
happened
on
the
night
of
the
murder
i
tell
you
i
do
know
anything
you
were
here
when
the
bounder
came
to
see
fenton
were
you
not
yes
i
was
the
man
made
the
answer
with
the
greatest
reluctance
and
his
manner
said
plainly
that
he
gladly
have
lied
had
he
been
sure
as
to
the
extent
of
his
questioner
knowledge
joe
had
been
out
somewhere
and
when
he
came
in
he
said
he
had
a
date
with
a
party
it
was
then
ten
and
after
we
talked
a
while
and
then
this
man
burton
came
in
joe
took
him
to
one
side
and
they
began
to
talk
i
did
pay
much
attention
to
them
except
that
they
were
having
a
little
argument
over
something
then
i
heard
a
kind
of
a
smack
and
i
looked
up
and
saw
joe
standing
with
his
hand
to
his
face
and
the
other
fellow
turning
his
back
on
him
just
as
cool
as
anything
you
want
to
put
your
eyes
on
for
a
second
i
thought
joe
was
going
to
take
the
thing
and
say
nothing
and
then
the
man
paused
here
and
said
and
then
he
was
about
to
draw
a
revolver
but
you
stopped
him
hutchinson
stared
at
the
speaker
the
desire
to
deny
this
was
strong
in
his
face
but
the
certainty
of
the
keen
eyes
was
so
great
that
he
said
weakly
joe
was
only
a
little
wild
that
all
he
did
mean
any
harm
when
i
spoke
to
him
he
was
as
quiet
as
a
baby
asked
a
dozen
more
questions
regarding
the
relationship
between
the
bounder
and
fenton
hutchinson
answered
them
all
hesitatingly
and
with
many
qualifications
finally
the
front
door
swung
open
and
scanlon
who
was
watching
it
said
here
your
man
now
fenton
frowning
and
evidently
in
bad
humor
entered
the
back
room
hutchinson
greeted
him
with
hello
joe
a
couple
of
people
who
want
to
talk
to
you
nodded
to
the
man
who
looked
at
him
inquiringly
what
do
you
want
asked
he
it
ought
to
be
something
bright
to
rout
a
man
out
of
bed
i
like
to
ask
you
one
or
two
questions
said
smoothly
questions
fenton
eyes
narrowed
what
kind
of
questions
about
tom
burton
replied
i
like
to
know
what
happened
after
he
left
this
place
with
you
on
his
track
fenton
gave
a
quick
hunted
look
around
for
an
instant
his
eyes
rested
upon
the
street
door
but
scanlon
big
body
was
between
him
and
it
in
a
twinkling
it
be
easier
to
answer
the
questions
said
bat
unconcernedly
we
get
you
in
a
minute
or
two
the
man
glance
went
to
hutchinson
accusingly
and
the
manager
of
the
pool
room
at
once
began
to
protest
honest
joe
i
did
say
a
word
they
came
in
here
and
wanted
to
see
you
and
i
thought
it
best
to
get
it
over
with
you
followed
tom
burton
to
stanwick
said
a
person
who
saw
you
there
has
made
a
direct
accusation
against
you
the
face
of
the
man
went
white
what
did
they
say
he
demanded
they
liars
what
did
they
say
i
did
do
a
thing
well
if
you
did
the
best
thing
to
do
is
to
clear
yourself
of
suspicion
by
telling
all
you
know
i
have
had
it
from
two
different
sources
that
you
had
business
with
the
bounder
that
night
what
was
its
nature
fenton
hesitated
a
moment
his
furtive
mind
was
working
desperately
for
a
way
to
avoid
admitting
light
upon
his
doings
but
apparently
he
could
think
of
none
for
he
said
slowly
i
been
acquainted
with
tom
burton
for
years
sometimes
i
would
see
anything
of
him
for
a
long
time
and
then
bitterly
i
know
he
was
flush
he
never
came
near
me
unless
he
was
broke
and
wanted
something
done
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
he
showed
up
and
handed
me
the
details
of
a
little
game
that
looked
like
easy
money
i
was
to
work
it
and
we
were
to
split
the
proceeds
and
this
i
suppose
is
the
matter
he
came
to
see
you
about
on
the
night
he
was
killed
yes
answered
fenton
and
he
laughed
as
he
said
it
that
the
thing
he
came
around
like
a
lord
and
put
his
mitt
out
for
his
cut
of
the
plunder
he
had
an
easy
way
of
doing
things
so
easy
that
he
often
took
people
by
surprise
and
got
by
with
it
but
this
time
he
was
in
wrong
i
been
dumped
by
him
so
often
that
i
was
cagy
i
looked
over
the
game
he
handed
me
give
it
a
good
careful
look
mind
you
and
i
found
there
was
about
twenty
per
cent
profit
and
eighty
per
cent
danger
he
was
to
cut
the
twenty
with
me
but
i
was
to
take
all
of
the
eighty
just
like
them
kind
of
people
said
hutchinson
they
always
looking
for
somebody
to
take
their
chances
and
feed
them
pap
so
i
called
off
on
the
thing
said
fenton
and
when
he
came
around
on
the
night
he
said
he
would
i
laid
him
out
strong
for
trying
to
get
me
into
such
a
thing
when
he
found
i
him
and
there
was
no
easy
money
for
him
he
pulled
back
and
hit
me
and
then
walked
out
expecting
to
get
away
with
it
i
dipped
for
my
gun
i
was
so
sore
but
hutchinson
here
stopped
me
then
i
knew
that
to
gun
him
would
be
a
boob
play
but
i
meant
to
get
back
at
him
so
i
followed
him
for
a
chance
to
lay
him
out
the
man
paused
for
a
moment
or
two
the
balls
clicked
about
the
tables
the
clouds
of
tobacco
smoke
drifted
among
the
bright
white
lights
overhead
the
players
talked
monotonously
among
themselves
he
went
to
an
part
of
the
town
said
fenton
and
before
i
had
a
chance
had
gone
into
a
house
he
was
inside
for
about
half
an
hour
and
i
waited
for
him
when
he
came
out
he
no
sooner
hit
the
sidewalk
than
i
knew
something
had
happened
to
him
and
it
was
something
good
before
he
gone
in
he
pulled
along
pretty
slow
with
his
head
down
but
now
he
was
chipper
and
feeling
good
as
he
passed
where
i
was
hid
i
heard
him
laugh
i
wondered
what
it
was
that
was
doing
it
and
in
a
couple
of
minutes
i
found
out
he
stopped
under
a
light
and
took
something
out
of
his
overcoat
pocket
i
was
near
enough
to
get
a
slant
at
it
and
saw
he
had
a
whole
handful
of
diamonds
hutchinson
drew
in
a
long
breath
looked
at
scanlon
and
that
gentleman
nodded
his
satisfaction
with
the
apparent
straightforwardness
of
the
story
so
after
he
had
flashed
a
thing
like
that
said
fenton
i
altered
my
mind
a
little
i
would
do
any
stuff
i
try
and
stand
it
on
the
sparks
at
first
burton
did
seem
to
know
what
to
do
he
stopped
a
couple
of
times
as
if
he
was
thinking
then
he
seemed
to
grab
at
an
idea
and
started
off
for
the
railroad
station
he
bought
a
ticket
and
boarded
a
local
train
and
i
followed
him
he
got
off
at
stanwick
and
went
at
once
to
the
house
on
duncan
street
i
walked
into
the
side
yard
for
it
was
pretty
dark
there
at
first
but
then
the
moon
came
out
from
behind
some
buildings
and
flooded
all
over
the
place
and
i
had
to
stick
close
to
the
side
of
the
house
where
the
shadows
were
did
you
go
to
the
other
side
at
all
asked
ashton
kirk
yes
a
couple
of
times
but
i
could
stay
long
for
i
was
afraid
some
one
would
see
me
once
i
looked
in
at
a
window
that
was
lighted
up
and
there
was
the
bounder
talking
to
some
one
and
he
was
laughing
and
showing
her
diamonds
is
that
all
you
saw
fenton
shook
his
head
no
said
he
it
was
i
saw
a
woman
a
little
while
later
she
was
snooping
around
in
the
dark
and
then
she
hid
behind
a
kind
of
a
thing
that
they
grow
vines
over
and
watched
the
window
what
else
did
you
see
there
was
a
silence
after
this
question
as
fenton
squirmed
and
shifted
his
eyes
like
a
trapped
tiger
went
on
remember
there
has
been
a
direct
charge
against
you
that
you
killed
the
man
you
followed
from
this
place
that
a
lie
said
fenton
it
a
lie
i
did
it
was
that
woman
killed
him
and
i
saw
her
do
it
chapter
xxiv
quigley
is
interviewed
for
a
moment
there
was
a
halt
hutchinson
and
scanlon
looked
at
the
man
without
speaking
and
the
heart
of
the
big
athlete
turned
sick
at
what
he
had
heard
you
saw
her
strike
the
blow
asked
the
investigator
yes
with
a
big
brass
thing
i
thought
it
was
a
poker
but
the
papers
said
afterward
it
was
a
candlestick
and
i
guess
it
was
what
did
you
do
after
seeing
this
it
got
into
my
head
that
duncan
street
was
no
healthy
place
for
me
and
i
have
jumped
out
of
sight
only
for
seeing
the
woman
take
the
diamonds
she
took
them
then
it
was
the
first
thing
she
did
i
hung
to
the
outside
door
waiting
for
her
but
she
fooled
me
she
must
have
gone
out
some
other
way
for
i
heard
the
gate
click
and
saw
something
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
on
the
sidewalk
i
hurried
out
there
but
she
was
gone
i
did
get
another
peep
at
her
smiled
that
is
said
he
quietly
not
until
at
quigley
fenton
lower
jaw
dropped
and
he
stared
at
the
investigator
vacantly
at
quigley
said
he
you
saw
her
come
down
the
hall
while
you
were
at
the
broker
door
said
and
while
she
bargained
with
quigley
for
a
price
on
a
diamond
necklace
you
were
looking
in
once
more
she
wore
a
veil
but
veils
are
not
always
dependable
disguises
i
do
know
how
you
got
that
said
fenton
at
last
but
it
true
all
right
i
spotted
her
as
soon
as
i
saw
her
the
veil
might
as
well
not
been
there
drew
on
his
gloves
perhaps
you
be
called
upon
to
repeat
what
you
said
so
hold
yourself
ready
all
right
said
the
man
sullenly
you
know
where
to
find
me
i
guess
oh
yes
the
investigator
turned
to
hutchinson
and
continued
obliged
to
you
you
have
facilitated
matters
greatly
and
perhaps
saved
fenton
from
something
rather
serious
followed
by
scanlon
left
the
place
a
score
of
yards
away
the
investigator
gave
a
low
whistle
and
a
shadow
flitted
across
the
street
to
his
side
there
a
man
inside
there
i
want
you
to
keep
in
sight
fuller
said
the
investigator
the
name
is
fenton
and
he
has
a
broken
nose
oh
yes
i
know
him
said
fuller
readily
used
to
be
a
tout
in
the
old
sheepshead
bay
days
good
said
do
let
him
slip
you
it
important
fuller
at
once
started
toward
gaffney
and
the
investigator
and
scanlon
made
their
way
out
of
the
into
the
swirling
avenue
at
a
druggist
paused
and
the
two
went
in
a
telephone
book
was
flipped
over
until
the
letter
q
was
reached
ah
yes
said
the
investigator
quigley
lives
at
the
doric
apartments
then
as
he
closed
the
book
i
trust
we
shall
find
him
at
home
scanlon
said
nothing
while
the
other
called
a
taxi
and
when
the
vehicle
arrived
they
got
in
giving
the
driver
the
address
wanted
the
doric
apartments
was
a
new
and
pretentious
place
upon
a
wide
street
and
directly
opposite
a
small
green
park
there
was
a
great
deal
of
brass
and
marble
and
show
about
the
entrance
and
a
uniformed
attendant
announced
them
by
means
of
a
telephone
in
a
few
moments
the
man
turned
quigley
says
he
does
not
recognize
your
names
said
he
and
will
you
kindly
state
your
business
tell
him
it
is
very
important
that
we
must
see
him
at
once
that
it
will
be
to
his
interest
to
do
so
the
hall
porter
repeated
these
words
almost
as
they
were
given
to
him
but
apparently
the
man
above
was
not
convinced
he
says
that
he
can
not
be
seen
that
he
has
retired
spoke
the
hall
man
turning
once
more
can
you
not
call
at
his
office
in
the
morning
stepped
inside
the
brass
rail
if
you
please
said
he
to
the
man
as
he
took
possession
of
the
instrument
then
in
a
sharp
decisive
tone
he
spoke
into
the
transmitter
quigley
i
am
very
sorry
to
inconvenience
you
to
put
off
the
matter
of
which
i
have
to
speak
until
morning
would
perhaps
place
you
in
a
rather
hard
light
the
police
always
make
such
a
muddle
of
these
things
there
was
a
pause
then
came
a
shrill
piping
over
the
wire
startled
and
inquiring
scanlon
saw
the
investigator
smile
very
well
said
we
will
come
up
immediately
turning
to
the
hall
man
he
asked
where
is
quigley
apartment
twelfth
floor
sir
take
the
elevator
number
the
glittering
cage
swept
smoothly
up
through
the
shaft
and
at
the
twelfth
floor
stopped
third
door
to
your
right
suh
said
the
black
man
in
charge
was
about
to
knock
at
the
door
indicated
when
it
opened
and
they
saw
a
man
in
a
dressing
gown
a
long
side
growth
of
hair
brushed
over
a
bald
head
and
a
white
puffy
face
sir
said
he
agitatedly
i
really
must
protest
against
this
sort
of
thing
it
is
very
late
and
i
have
had
a
trying
day
i
repeat
quigley
i
am
sorry
to
disturb
you
but
as
i
have
also
said
the
matter
is
very
pressing
the
police
come
in
come
in
said
quigley
hastily
this
way
gentlemen
i
suppose
a
man
in
my
way
of
business
must
expect
certain
unforeseen
contingencies
they
passed
into
a
room
which
seemed
packed
tightly
with
glittering
things
everything
gleamed
not
a
foot
of
the
wall
but
had
a
painting
and
each
held
within
a
gilded
frame
small
marbles
shone
as
though
they
had
been
polished
each
piece
of
furniture
had
been
rubbed
to
the
ultimate
the
rugs
were
of
the
brightest
and
the
floor
threw
off
a
sheen
of
varnish
that
was
appalling
take
chairs
said
quigley
be
comfortable
now
that
you
are
here
and
when
he
saw
them
seated
he
stood
before
them
an
injured
look
upon
his
puffy
white
face
the
police
you
said
sir
now
just
what
of
the
police
about
a
week
ago
said
quietly
there
was
a
murder
done
at
stanwick
perhaps
you
recall
it
the
victim
was
a
man
of
the
name
of
burton
burton
quigley
nodded
and
pursed
his
lips
to
hide
a
tremble
that
was
there
yes
i
recall
that
deplorable
affair
the
son
was
taken
for
the
crime
i
think
he
looked
at
the
investigator
with
uncertainty
in
his
eyes
but
why
do
you
speak
of
that
matter
in
connection
as
it
were
with
me
by
an
odd
train
of
circumstances
spoke
there
was
a
robbery
committed
at
the
time
of
the
murder
some
diamonds
were
taken
diamonds
quigley
mouth
dropped
open
and
his
pale
face
became
positively
ghastly
why
in
my
reading
of
the
newspaper
accounts
of
the
case
i
saw
no
mention
of
a
robbery
nodded
that
is
true
because
this
phase
of
the
matter
is
one
of
which
neither
the
newspapers
nor
the
police
know
anything
as
yet
he
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
and
continued
in
his
smoothest
tones
among
the
things
taken
was
a
diamond
necklace
and
this
was
sold
to
you
no
no
protested
the
man
it
is
not
true
sir
no
no
i
am
very
careful
i
never
purchase
or
lend
money
on
things
of
which
i
am
not
altogether
sure
the
necklace
was
brought
to
you
between
twelve
and
one
said
the
investigator
it
was
brought
by
a
woman
who
wore
a
veil
and
you
haggled
with
her
as
to
the
money
she
was
to
get
for
it
sir
said
quigley
lifting
one
hand
i
must
insist
that
you
are
mistaken
i
must
insist
that
this
is
a
but
stopped
him
when
i
had
the
man
send
up
my
name
a
while
ago
said
the
investigator
you
replied
that
you
did
not
know
me
surely
quigley
your
memory
is
much
better
than
that
i
would
hesitate
to
accuse
a
man
in
your
line
of
effort
of
being
so
forgetful
only
three
years
ago
i
transacted
a
little
business
with
you
the
matter
of
senator
donaldson
collection
of
revolutionary
autographs
they
had
been
taken
by
his
younger
son
since
dead
and
sold
to
you
if
it
had
not
been
that
the
senator
was
anxious
to
hush
the
matter
up
you
would
have
had
some
trouble
on
your
hands
mr
quigley
the
broker
choked
and
gasped
and
when
he
came
out
of
this
his
whole
manner
had
undergone
a
change
said
he
i
beg
your
pardon
i
do
recognize
you
now
but
sir
you
had
entirely
slipped
my
memory
if
you
had
not
mentioned
that
unfortunate
donaldson
episode
i
would
not
have
recalled
you
that
was
one
of
those
things
in
which
even
a
very
honest
man
might
become
involved
i
was
deceived
in
that
case
and
let
us
agree
then
that
you
were
deceived
and
that
being
so
is
it
not
possible
that
it
might
have
happened
again
reluctantly
quigley
agreed
that
this
was
so
however
said
he
i
take
all
precautions
i
ask
questions
i
delve
into
the
history
of
every
valuable
thing
offered
me
but
i
admit
that
i
have
been
misled
once
or
twice
in
spite
of
all
i
could
do
suppose
said
you
allow
us
a
look
at
the
necklace
and
but
it
is
not
here
exclaimed
quigley
it
is
at
my
office
locked
away
in
the
safe
very
well
said
we
have
a
cab
outside
let
us
go
to
your
office
it
is
late
expostulated
the
broker
i
had
retired
for
the
night
why
not
morning
sir
the
morning
will
find
us
fresh
and
wakeful
and
we
can
talk
things
over
at
our
leisure
the
morning
has
one
drawback
said
the
police
may
in
the
interim
learn
something
and
if
you
are
not
arrayed
on
the
side
of
the
law
by
the
time
they
reach
you
you
may
be
decidedly
inconvenienced
not
only
in
this
matter
but
in
others
as
well
this
seemed
powerfully
to
impress
quigley
i
shall
do
as
you
request
said
he
i
put
myself
entirely
in
your
hands
if
you
will
give
me
a
few
moments
to
dress
i
will
go
with
you
to
my
place
of
business
and
permit
you
to
examine
the
necklace
i
am
always
ready
to
demonstrate
my
integrity
no
one
has
ever
found
me
unwilling
to
comply
with
every
requirement
of
a
reputable
business
man
with
that
quigley
disappeared
and
within
fifteen
minutes
he
emerged
from
the
rooms
beyond
fully
dressed
including
a
most
respectable
top
hat
they
descended
and
got
into
a
cab
and
in
a
little
while
brought
up
at
the
chandler
building
where
the
broker
had
his
office
a
night
man
sleepily
ran
them
up
to
the
required
floor
and
quigley
unlocked
his
office
door
now
gentlemen
said
he
it
is
fortunate
that
i
still
have
what
you
desire
to
see
here
in
the
office
i
have
a
very
good
safe
but
never
trust
anything
to
it
of
extreme
value
unless
i
am
compelled
to
do
so
this
necklace
came
too
late
for
me
to
place
it
in
the
vault
i
use
for
such
things
so
i
had
to
keep
it
here
overnight
illustration
then
the
door
swung
open
he
turned
the
knob
of
a
formidable
looking
safe
until
he
had
effected
the
proper
combination
then
the
door
swung
open
the
inner
door
was
then
unlocked
and
quigley
pulled
out
a
drawer
from
this
he
took
a
magnificent
necklace
of
diamonds
which
gleamed
resplendently
under
the
lights
this
is
the
article
you
spoke
of
said
he
quite
handsome
but
i
feel
sure
that
it
is
in
no
way
connected
with
the
unhappy
affair
at
stanwick
took
the
jewels
in
his
hand
and
examined
them
keenly
then
he
held
them
out
to
scanlon
what
do
you
think
he
asked
i
have
only
a
description
to
go
by
but
you
must
have
seen
the
stones
frequently
at
close
hand
are
they
the
same
scanlon
needed
only
one
glance
they
are
returned
he
i
know
this
necklace
among
a
thousand
the
lady
who
left
them
with
me
said
quigley
still
hopeful
was
quite
respectable
i
vouch
for
that
at
any
time
she
is
a
widow
and
was
once
in
good
circumstances
you
know
her
then
said
oh
yes
we
have
had
a
number
of
small
but
here
the
man
paused
abruptly
then
he
began
a
fit
of
coughing
which
was
unquestionably
intended
to
cover
the
break
oh
yes
he
resumed
i
know
her
quite
well
you
were
about
to
say
spoke
coolly
that
you
have
had
a
number
of
small
transactions
with
her
how
recent
were
these
quigley
blew
his
nose
violently
and
cleared
his
throat
as
though
the
coughing
spell
had
left
him
in
an
obstructed
condition
why
he
gasped
trying
to
assume
a
most
confidential
manner
that
would
be
rather
difficult
to
say
you
see
i
keep
a
very
neglectful
run
of
these
people
and
my
memory
is
really
very
poor
the
necklace
was
not
the
only
jewel
stolen
at
stanwick
said
quietly
there
were
a
number
of
other
pieces
and
i
must
really
insist
that
you
cudgel
your
mind
for
the
facts
you
must
have
entries
somewhere
in
your
books
i
am
asking
this
as
a
favor
of
course
if
the
police
were
requested
to
appear
in
the
matter
they
would
use
methods
entirely
different
from
it
is
barely
possible
that
my
clerk
has
some
record
of
these
things
said
quigley
hastily
just
one
moment
please
and
i
will
ascertain
he
went
into
an
inner
office
took
a
book
from
a
desk
drawer
and
began
turning
the
leaves
with
a
moistened
thumb
scanlon
catching
the
eye
of
the
investigator
winked
knowingly
why
to
be
sure
said
quigley
of
course
here
it
is
fortunately
she
has
been
in
the
office
three
times
in
the
past
week
stepped
behind
the
counter
and
into
the
inner
office
and
coolly
looked
over
the
broker
shoulder
do
you
see
asked
quigley
right
here
there
are
three
rings
in
one
item
and
there
is
a
brooch
in
another
and
then
of
course
the
necklace
examined
the
entries
and
made
some
memoranda
in
a
small
book
then
he
began
asking
some
questions
in
a
voice
so
low
that
scanlon
caught
only
a
word
here
and
there
he
recognized
woman
also
veil
and
in
another
place
this
afternoon
it
were
as
though
were
urging
the
man
to
accompany
him
somewhere
which
quigley
seemed
loth
to
do
then
the
investigator
took
something
from
his
pocket
and
showed
it
to
the
other
bat
caught
a
flash
of
it
it
was
a
photograph
of
nora
cavanaugh
and
the
broker
was
now
nodding
his
head
eagerly
as
he
gazed
at
it
they
going
to
nora
was
what
flashed
through
bat
brain
this
hound
of
a
try
and
put
something
on
her
whether
it
true
or
not
his
mind
seethed
with
this
for
a
moment
and
then
came
another
idea
but
they
not
take
her
by
surprise
i
get
there
before
them
and
tell
her
and
silently
scanlon
slipped
through
the
hall
door
and
was
gone
chapter
xxv
nora
talks
and
scanlon
listens
as
bat
scanlon
stepped
out
of
the
street
car
which
took
him
to
nora
cavanaugh
house
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
almost
midnight
she
have
had
time
to
get
home
he
said
to
himself
but
maybe
be
too
late
to
see
her
but
he
set
his
jaw
at
this
thought
and
shook
his
head
with
a
motion
he
sprang
up
the
steps
and
pulled
at
the
bell
viciously
to
his
surprise
the
door
opened
at
once
and
he
saw
nora
in
her
coat
and
furs
a
veil
over
her
face
standing
in
the
hall
bat
she
said
and
stood
staring
at
him
just
come
in
he
asked
no
was
the
answer
i
i
just
going
out
then
i
see
there
was
something
in
his
manner
and
tone
which
caused
her
to
look
at
him
steadily
then
with
a
little
gesture
she
said
will
you
come
in
he
entered
and
she
closed
the
door
as
he
stood
there
turning
his
hat
about
in
his
hands
he
looked
very
big
and
stubborn
and
if
you
understood
him
very
well
as
nora
did
very
much
afraid
it
is
late
she
said
is
anything
wrong
there
will
be
said
bat
there
will
be
unless
something
is
done
to
head
it
off
without
a
word
she
led
the
way
into
a
room
at
one
side
and
after
they
had
sat
down
she
asked
and
now
what
is
it
i
just
been
with
to
see
a
man
of
the
name
of
quigley
a
sort
of
pawnbroker
his
eyes
were
upon
her
but
she
continued
to
regard
him
steadily
without
any
change
of
expression
a
necklace
had
been
taken
to
him
by
a
woman
a
diamond
necklace
her
eyes
wavered
at
this
and
an
expression
of
fear
came
into
her
face
there
was
a
pause
and
then
bat
leaned
forward
and
said
in
a
lowered
voice
what
made
you
say
that
you
had
put
your
jewels
away
in
a
vault
she
arose
and
went
to
his
side
bat
she
said
i
felt
sure
your
friend
would
find
me
out
i
knew
from
the
first
that
i
was
not
cunning
enough
to
conceal
anything
from
him
nora
said
scanlon
as
he
too
arose
why
did
you
try
again
there
was
a
pause
and
again
the
big
athlete
broke
the
silence
as
i
have
told
you
more
than
once
said
he
i
believe
in
you
nothing
can
shake
me
from
that
there
are
a
great
many
things
you
have
said
and
done
that
i
do
not
understand
others
of
them
i
see
through
though
you
did
not
intend
that
i
should
why
was
all
this
why
did
you
tell
me
the
facts
as
they
stood
bat
she
said
i
did
dare
i
was
afraid
afraid
of
what
he
looked
down
at
her
her
face
was
pale
her
gloved
hands
were
clasped
tremblingly
that
night
when
tom
burton
came
here
he
struck
you
we
saw
the
mark
but
you
said
it
was
caused
by
something
else
he
also
stole
your
jewels
but
you
said
nothing
nora
was
there
any
good
reason
why
you
should
have
misled
us
like
that
she
reached
out
and
touched
his
arm
i
can
see
she
said
that
it
will
be
useless
to
carry
the
thing
any
further
i
did
think
i
could
manage
it
myself
but
i
see
now
that
it
was
hopeless
from
the
start
will
you
sit
down
there
was
a
certain
sweet
humbleness
in
her
voice
which
turned
the
big
man
heart
to
water
tell
you
everything
now
and
so
you
may
judge
me
for
yourself
once
more
they
sat
down
nora
drew
the
veil
still
further
from
her
face
and
began
to
speak
in
a
low
voice
but
steadily
and
with
no
hesitation
tom
burton
did
strike
me
that
night
and
i
would
not
tell
the
truth
about
it
bat
because
i
was
ashamed
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
admit
that
the
man
i
had
chosen
for
my
husband
would
do
such
a
thing
other
misdoings
of
his
i
could
speak
of
but
that
one
i
felt
i
must
always
keep
to
myself
his
taking
of
my
jewels
i
would
not
have
held
from
you
if
i
had
not
been
afraid
afraid
as
i
never
was
before
of
what
asked
scanlon
tom
burton
was
killed
in
his
son
house
i
knew
that
son
i
knew
what
he
had
suffered
all
his
life
because
of
his
father
i
had
heard
the
story
in
all
its
pitiful
details
as
a
child
he
had
been
affronted
and
mishandled
as
a
boy
as
a
young
man
he
could
never
forget
what
his
mother
had
been
forced
to
endure
in
his
mind
was
always
the
fact
that
his
sister
was
an
invalid
perhaps
for
life
owing
to
the
poverty
brought
on
them
by
their
father
neglect
with
all
this
before
me
can
you
wonder
that
i
was
afraid
afraid
that
the
boy
in
a
moment
of
madness
had
struck
his
father
down
bat
drew
in
a
long
breath
in
it
there
was
a
vast
relief
and
a
certain
wonder
no
said
he
no
did
you
think
that
the
idea
was
agonizing
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
do
all
i
could
to
save
him
that
is
why
i
appealed
to
you
to
get
me
all
the
intimate
details
then
he
was
arrested
the
body
had
been
examined
by
the
coroner
but
no
word
was
said
of
my
jewels
it
was
then
that
a
second
thought
came
to
me
suppose
the
murder
had
not
been
done
after
all
in
a
sudden
mounting
of
fury
suppose
the
boy
had
seen
the
diamonds
and
had
been
tempted
suppose
he
had
killed
tom
burton
in
order
to
get
possession
of
them
i
was
appalled
at
the
notion
which
with
each
moment
became
more
and
more
a
conviction
but
i
still
held
to
the
resolve
to
help
him
what
if
he
had
done
the
thing
was
it
altogether
his
fault
was
it
not
a
part
of
an
inheritance
from
a
tainted
father
so
i
said
nothing
of
my
loss
of
the
jewels
the
dread
was
in
me
that
if
the
facts
concerning
them
were
known
suspicion
would
fall
upon
him
they
might
discover
the
stolen
things
on
him
and
so
he
would
lose
his
life
as
well
as
his
life
happiness
because
of
that
man
i
felt
that
no
part
of
the
truth
must
come
out
that
i
must
not
even
tell
of
my
husband
visit
to
me
that
night
and
when
in
talking
with
you
at
your
office
i
permitted
the
fact
to
slip
i
was
startled
i
remember
that
you
were
said
bat
and
i
wondered
what
it
meant
he
sat
for
a
space
and
looked
at
her
and
then
as
she
said
nothing
more
he
went
on
you
do
not
know
it
but
for
days
things
fell
in
such
combinations
that
more
than
once
it
looked
as
though
would
be
accused
bat
she
cried
out
his
name
frightened
and
her
wide
brown
eyes
opened
to
their
fullest
extent
even
an
hour
ago
i
saw
and
heard
some
things
which
seemed
to
point
to
you
maybe
if
my
nerves
were
keyed
up
as
they
are
i
would
have
thought
so
but
anyway
i
did
and
that
what
brought
me
here
but
surely
and
her
voice
was
broken
by
the
shortness
of
her
breathing
surely
you
never
thought
this
of
me
but
bat
did
not
deny
it
what
else
was
i
to
do
when
things
piled
up
as
they
did
some
of
them
i
do
understand
at
this
minute
and
maybe
i
never
understand
them
but
there
are
others
and
he
looked
at
her
with
frank
inquiry
in
his
face
that
you
can
explain
and
nora
i
looking
to
you
to
do
it
and
with
that
he
told
her
of
the
things
he
had
heard
from
big
slim
and
of
those
he
had
seen
at
bohlmier
hotel
she
listened
with
many
little
gasps
and
surprised
gestures
to
think
of
that
man
being
so
near
to
me
that
night
she
said
when
he
had
done
and
watching
me
with
such
an
intent
and
now
poor
bat
with
a
little
sound
in
her
voice
which
was
part
a
sob
and
part
a
laugh
because
he
saw
so
much
and
understood
so
little
and
told
it
all
to
you
i
will
have
to
speak
of
something
i
never
expected
to
make
known
to
any
one
you
know
how
i
have
always
dreaded
and
detested
divorce
how
the
thought
of
it
almost
sickened
me
well
bat
two
years
ago
i
felt
i
could
endure

burton
no
longer
and
had
all
the
preliminary
papers
for
a
proceeding
made
out
what
said
scanlon
you
nora
i
did
but
then
all
my
old
feeling
against
the
thing
overtook
me
and
i
laid
the
papers
away
in
a
little
silver
box
which
i
kept
in
a
drawer
in
my
room
when
tom
burton
struck
and
robbed
me
that
night
i
was
in
a
perfect
whirl
of
feeling
i
resolved
to
be
free
of
him
forever
and
do
it
at
once
what
i
was
seen
to
take
from
the
drawer
bat
was
the
little
silver
box
holding
those
papers
i
rushed
from
the
house
meaning
to
go
to
my
lawyer
and
i
was
a
half
dozen
blocks
away
when
i
came
out
of
the
state
i
was
in
realized
the
hour
and
the
impossibility
of
the
whole
situation
and
returned
home
that
it
said
bat
with
the
sigh
of
a
man
relieved
of
a
heavy
burden
that
it
i
might
have
known
that
it
would
be
something
of
that
sort
then
you
did
not
go
to
stanwick
at
all
that
night
i
never
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
and
when
i
first
heard
of
this
man
you
call
big
slim
went
on
nora
it
was
in
a
letter
he
wrote
me
after
the
murder
and
of
which
he
spoke
guardedly
i
felt
that
this
was
a
clue
that
if
followed
i
might
be
able
to
show
poor
frank
burton
to
be
innocent
after
all
so
i
did
what
i
otherwise
would
never
have
done
i
went
to
the
place
mentioned
which
was
the
hotel
kept
by
that
fiendish
old
man
bohlmier
what
did
they
want
it
was
blackmail
they
too
fancied
i
was
at
stanwick
that
night
they
knew
about
the
diamonds
though
i
did
not
then
know
how
they
came
by
the
information
they
thought
to
frighten
me
into
paying
a
sum
of
money
the
tall
man
threat
was
of
the
police
whom
he
said
would
be
sure
to
connect
me
with
the
crime
but
i
laughed
at
him
and
dared
him
to
do
anything
he
had
in
mind
the
old
man
i
think
would
have
threatened
my
life
i
had
heard
some
of
his
talk
in
the
next
room
that
is
why
i
took
up
the
revolver
from
the
table
and
when
i
listened
at
the
wall
it
was
to
hear
what
more
he
might
say
they
keep
your
house
under
watch
said
scanlon
i
know
i
see
them
loitering
in
the
street
almost
constantly
and
they
write
me
threatening
letters
but
i
never
been
afraid
of
them
until
last
night
after
you
had
gone
oh
please
bat
forgive
me
for
keeping
it
from
you
when
you
were
so
worried
for
my
sake
and
so
good
to
me
but
i
went
to
stanwick
i
felt
that
i
had
to
there
was
something
i
must
know
these
men
followed
me
bat
i
did
not
know
it
until
i
had
left
the
house
after
my
visit
then
the
old
man
came
up
to
me
in
the
dark
he
drew
out
a
knife
i
saw
it
quite
plainly
somehow
and
then
some
one
seized
him
and
she
stopped
and
looked
at
the
big
athlete
intently
the
expression
upon
his
face
was
one
not
to
be
mistaken
it
was
you
she
said
bat
it
was
you
he
told
her
how
he
came
to
be
there
and
also
of
what
he
saw
afterward
of
how
mary
burton
went
so
strangely
through
the
house
and
of
the
words
of
the
old
man
who
scouted
the
idea
of
the
girl
being
ill
and
who
had
protested
he
had
seen
her
leave
the
house
more
than
once
since
the
crime
in
a
sort
of
disguise
as
nora
listened
to
this
her
face
grew
rigid
with
apprehension
when
you
returned
from
your
first
visit
to
stanwick
she
said
after
he
had
finished
and
told
me
of
the
way
young
frank
burton
acted
and
spoke
while
being
examined
by
the
police
an
idea
came
into
my
mind
which
i
at
once
put
away
from
me
i
knew
mary
burton
because
of
her
illness
had
moments
in
which
she
was
not
quite
herself
suppose
it
were
not
frank
after
all
who
did
the
thing
i
so
feared
suppose
it
were
she
ah
said
scanlon
got
that
too
did
you
but
i
refused
to
consider
it
the
idea
of
frank
was
bad
enough
but
that
of
mary
was
so
much
worse
that
i
could
not
bear
it
but
when
the
papers
came
out
saying
that
a
woman
was
suspected
i
could
bear
it
no
longer
i
got
permission
to
see
frank
and
told
him
of
what
was
being
said
he
denied
it
furiously
and
it
was
then
i
knew
he
too
though
neither
of
us
mentioned
her
name
believed
his
sister
guilty
he
had
taken
suspicion
and
imprisonment
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
police
from
her
and
now
he
was
ready
to
confess
the
crime
if
his
other
sacrifices
failed
bat
scanlon
looked
at
her
and
marveled
how
he
had
ever
permitted
the
real
truth
behind
this
situation
to
escape
him
as
it
had
and
as
he
looked
little
incidents
fragments
of
conversations
came
to
him
and
he
realized
that
his
state
of
mind
had
not
been
so
extraordinary
after
all
tell
me
said
he
the
talk
between
and
burgess
strong
in
his
mind
a
conversation
which
seemed
to
point
so
directly
toward
nora
has
mary
burton
ever
traveled
much
has
she
ever
held
positions
of
any
kind
in
other
cities
there
have
been
periods
when
she
has
been
almost
well
said
nora
and
she
has
been
in
other
cities
at
these
times
and
perhaps
has
had
employment
by
george
said
bat
with
a
sigh
things
do
work
out
queerly
i
was
almost
sure
that
you
were
but
he
stopped
there
the
scene
in
quigley
office
an
hour
before
suddenly
flared
up
in
his
mind
vividly
i
guess
he
went
on
it
all
up
with
that
poor
thing
in
spite
of
her
brother
and
everything
else
hard
to
fool
and
he
must
have
had
an
eye
on
her
and
been
tracing
her
doings
from
the
first
he
knows
she
been
selling
the
diamonds
and
he
has
a
witness
who
says
he
saw
her
strike
the
blow
that
did
for
her
father
and
just
before
i
left
i
heard
him
planning
for
a
little
journey
somewhere
at
first
i
thought
it
was
here
and
so
i
came
to
warn
you
but
i
see
it
was
stanwick
he
had
in
view
he
take
the
police
maybe
and
arrest
mary
burton
oh
no
no
nora
was
standing
before
him
oh
no
if
i
had
reason
to
try
and
protect
the
brother
i
have
a
double
reason
for
protecting
her
for
she
has
suffered
even
more
and
is
much
more
helpless
she
stood
looking
at
him
for
an
instant
and
then
went
on
bat
you
came
here
in
spite
of
your
friendship
for
to
warn
me
of
what
you
thought
a
danger
will
you
go
with
me
to
warn
mary
burton
of
what
you
is
one
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
he
said
slowly
i
have
the
same
reason
in
her
case
nora
but
if
you
ask
me
to
do
it
why
i
will
i
was
about
to
go
to
her
as
you
rang
the
bell
she
said
i
know
why
but
just
felt
that
i
had
to
i
ask
you
to
come
with
me
and
held
out
her
hand
he
grasped
this
eagerly
and
then
without
another
word
they
were
upon
the
street
and
hurrying
away
through
the
night
chapter
xxvi
conclusion
scanlon
and
nora
cavanaugh
were
hurrying
through
the
vast
at
the
railroad
station
when
the
big
athlete
felt
a
touch
upon
his
arm
not
that
way
old
chap
said
a
voice
at
his
side
it
was
smiling
and
unruffled
and
near
by
stood
the
broker
quigley
nora
gave
a
gasp
of
despair
and
scanlon
felt
her
cling
to
him
tremblingly
fenton
is
outside
there
resumed
the
investigator
nodding
his
head
toward
the
train
shed
i
have
a
notion
that
he
on
his
way
to
stanwick
if
you
go
out
he
see
you
bat
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
after
all
his
own
mission
and
that
of
nora
was
not
suspected
is
fuller
trailing
him
he
asked
yes
he
just
gave
me
the
word
as
he
passed
quigley
as
he
stood
waiting
had
a
most
uncomfortable
expression
upon
his
face
he
stood
first
upon
one
foot
and
then
upon
the
other
evidently
what
was
in
prospect
for
him
was
not
at
all
to
his
liking
quigley
and
myself
had
intended
taking
the
train
for
stanwick
said
but
i
think
now
that
we
better
not
not
go
it
was
nora
who
spoke
and
there
was
eagerness
in
her
voice
not
by
train
smiled
the
investigator
what
your
idea
of
going
there
asked
bat
with
an
assumption
of
ease
why
i
might
ask
you
that
old
chap
said
the
other
thoughtfully
but
i
wo
but
my
errand
is
no
secret
it
a
little
matter
of
identification
at
this
moment
quigley
advanced
and
with
a
bow
to
nora
said
if
i
have
been
an
innocent
instrument
perfectly
innocent
mind
you
in
the
hands
of
a
designing
person
miss
cavanaugh
i
beg
your
pardon
i
was
assured
that
the
jewels
were
honestly
come
by
and
when
told
me
a
while
ago
that
they
were
really
your
property
i
immediately
placed
myself
in
his
hands
most
anxious
that
complete
justice
should
be
done
nora
made
a
vague
answer
to
this
for
at
the
moment
she
was
watching
the
investigator
who
stood
with
narrowed
eyes
a
thoughtful
wrinkle
between
his
brows
and
one
hand
stroking
his
chin
and
as
she
watched
him
he
spoke
to
scanlon
it
may
be
said
he
and
there
was
a
slow
curious
smile
about
the
corners
of
his
mouth
that
fenton
blundering
into
my
plans
will
not
be
serious
after
all
indeed
it
may
be
turned
to
account
the
singular
eyes
went
to
the
girl
you
are
interested
in
this
case
miss
cavanaugh
and
so
is
scanlon
why
not
go
with
quigley
and
myself
and
witness
its
solution
fenton
will
spot
us
said
scanlon
he
had
still
a
hope
of
doing
what
he
and
nora
had
set
out
to
do
and
the
pallor
of
her
beautiful
face
and
the
misery
in
her
eyes
urged
him
to
lose
no
chance
once
out
of
sight
of
the
keen
eyes
of
the
investigator
he
and
the
girl
could
take
a
taxi
and
make
for
stanwick
with
all
speed
not
if
we
go
by
motor
said
in
answer
to
his
objections
we
can
do
that
and
make
as
good
time
as
the
local
taxicabs
are
so
small
said
nora
as
they
descended
a
long
flight
of
steps
to
the
street
four
will
crowd
one
so
in
her
mind
was
the
same
thought
as
in
that
of
bat
once
let
them
divide
into
two
parties
she
and
scanlon
making
one
and
she
was
quite
sure
that
cab
would
be
the
first
at
no
duncan
street
but
the
investigator
dashed
this
hope
by
leading
the
way
when
they
reached
the
street
to
where
some
touring
cars
were
to
hire
near
the
station
these
said
he
quietly
will
be
comfortable
there
was
a
businesslike
young
man
in
charge
of
the
first
of
the
cars
and
he
made
his
bargain
cranked
his
engine
received
his
orders
and
started
off
in
an
amazingly
brief
time
inside
of
twenty
minutes
the
suburbs
with
their
long
rows
of
buildings
and
their
wide
and
smoothly
paved
streets
began
to
swing
past
them
i
have
your
interest
to
thank
miss
cavanaugh
said
for
bringing
this
case
to
my
attention
as
a
participant
that
is
there
has
been
a
simplicity
in
it
which
has
attracted
me
from
the
start
and
at
the
same
time
a
curious
interweaving
of
threads
which
under
almost
any
other
set
of
circumstances
would
have
been
as
wide
apart
as
the
poles
scanlon
has
gone
partly
over
the
route
with
me
and
because
of
this
interweaving
i
have
had
considerable
trouble
in
preventing
his
jumping
at
conclusions
in
taking
appearance
for
granted
without
waiting
for
proof
i
am
not
sure
how
far
i
kept
him
from
error
with
a
nod
and
a
laugh
for
several
times
i
believe
he
has
gone
the
length
of
suspecting
you
nora
made
no
reply
to
this
but
scanlon
said
i
have
believed
she
did
it
everything
pointed
that
way
but
i
never
blamed
her
for
she
had
cause
enough
even
for
that
nodded
gravely
cause
yes
said
he
and
that
is
the
thing
connected
with
crime
of
a
certain
sort
sometimes
the
criminal
is
much
more
innocent
than
the
victim
he
sat
thoughtful
for
a
space
while
the
car
bounded
forward
over
the
roads
then
he
resumed
i
could
see
scanlon
where
and
how
your
thoughts
flowed
as
they
did
but
i
could
do
nothing
more
at
the
time
than
tell
you
to
make
no
snap
judgments
the
agitation
of
miss
cavanaugh
caught
your
attention
in
the
first
place
and
so
when
we
saw
a
woman
footprints
by
the
rose
arbor
you
concluded
they
were
hers
we
found
a
small
revolver
by
the
fence
that
also
made
you
think
of
her
when
by
means
of
the
particle
of
mortar
on
the
bar
of
the
cellar
grating
at
stanwick
i
discovered
that
the
same
person
who
had
prowled
about
the
lawn
on
the
night
of
the
murder
had
scaled
the
scaffolding
outside
miss
cavanaugh
window
you
fancied
this
to
be
almost
positive
proof
what
you
saw
at
bohlmier
hotel
and
the
story
told
you
by
big
slim
made
it
almost
damning
if
you
had
waited
as
a
man
more
experienced
in
such
things
would
have
done
and
the
investigator
smiled
at
his
friend
you
would
have
saved
yourself
a
state
of
mind
the
prints
at
the
rose
arbor
were
made
by
a
certain
sort
of
shoe
a
kind
which
i
felt
sure
miss
cavanaugh
never
wore
later
in
a
second
visit
which
i
paid
to
no
duncan
street
i
found
the
shoes
which
made
the
prints
and
still
with
particles
of
soil
clinging
to
them
bat
caught
a
little
moan
from
nora
and
he
held
her
cold
limp
hand
in
his
strong
warm
one
you
sure
of
that
said
he
to
quite
positive
and
the
matter
of
the
little
revolver
picked
up
on
the
lawn
that
belonged
to
fenton
he
probably
dropped
it
in
scaling
the
fence
by
means
of
a
strong
glass
i
saw
a
number
scratched
on
the
metal
of
the
butt
i
at
once
knew
this
to
be
a
pawnbroker
mark
fuller
inside
three
hours
had
located
the
pawnbroker
and
the
records
of
the
place
showed
the
weapon
had
been
sold
to
fenton
only
a
little
while
before
good
work
admired
bat
nice
and
speaking
of
fenton
went
on
it
rather
puzzled
me
at
first
how
he
had
been
over
the
ground
about
the
house
and
left
no
trace
but
a
little
attention
and
look
at
his
feet
showed
me
that
i
had
seen
his
tracks
all
over
one
side
of
the
lawn
the
ones
of
the
man
walking
on
his
toes
and
that
i
had
supposed
them
to
be
those
of
big
slim
before
he
put
on
his
tell
me
said
scanlon
have
you
ever
in
the
course
of
this
affair
believed
young
frank
burton
guilty
at
first
i
did
not
know
but
after
my
second
visit
to
duncan
street
and
a
little
talk
with
the
colored
maid
who
is
an
honest
imaginative
soul
i
was
convinced
that
he
was
innocent
what
did
the
maid
tell
you
asked
bat
after
the
bounder
had
been
admitted
to
the
house
that
night
she
had
gone
back
to
the
kitchen
to
her
work
she
heard
frank
come
in
but
she
did
not
catch
anything
of
the
altercation
which
followed
a
little
later
her
duties
finished
she
started
for
her
room
which
was
at
the
top
of
the
house
as
she
passed
along
the
hall
on
the
second
floor
she
noticed
the
door
of
the
bath
room
standing
open
and
remembered
she
had
not
supplied
it
with
fresh
towels
the
linen
closet
is
in
a
room
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall
she
went
there
and
procured
what
she
wanted
and
as
she
came
into
the
hall
once
more
she
saw
young
frank
burton
come
quickly
out
of
his
room
stand
at
the
head
of
the
stairway
for
a
moment
as
though
listening
and
then
hurry
down
to
the
floor
below
that
must
have
been
after
he
had
taken
his
sister
to
her
room
said
scanlon
but
shook
his
head
no
a
few
minutes
later
the
maid
saw
him
ascend
the
stairs
once
more
and
the
sister
was
with
him
then
but
cried
nora
a
vague
fear
as
to
what
this
might
lead
to
in
her
mind
when
the
maid
was
questioned
by
the
coroner
physician
she
said
but
the
investigator
stopped
her
as
i
have
said
the
maid
is
an
altogether
unimaginative
creature
and
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
anything
short
of
blows
or
outcries
could
have
anything
to
do
with
the
crime
it
was
plain
to
me
as
i
talked
to
her
that
she
had
even
then
no
notion
of
the
importance
of
what
she
was
saying
she
was
simply
answering
questions
however
added
to
what
the
nurse
had
told
shower
her
information
was
vital
indeed
miss
wheeler
had
gone
into
the
kitchen
if
you
recall
her
testimony
at
a
time
when
the
three
burtons
father
son
and
daughter
were
in
the
she
said
she
had
gone
to
tell
the
maid
she
might
go
to
bed
and
found
she
had
already
gone
also
she
remained
in
the
kitchen
for
a
space
attending
to
some
duties
of
her
own
during
this
interval
young
burton
must
have
gone
to
his
room
probably
sick
at
heart
with
the
wrangling
his
haste
in
emerging
from
the
room
when
the
colored
girl
saw
him
later
and
his
pause
to
listen
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
seem
to
indicate
that
something
had
attracted
his
attention
below
have
you
any
idea
what
that
was
asked
scanlon
i
am
not
yet
sure
but
this
is
how
it
builds
up
in
my
mind
when
he
reëntered
the
he
found
his
father
dead
and
his
sister
in
a
faint
having
of
course
a
full
knowledge
of
certain
nervous
seizures
to
which
his
sister
was
subject
it
rushed
upon
him
that
in
a
moment
of
frenzy
she
had
killed
her
father
no
cried
nora
cavanaugh
oh
no
he
only
supposing
said
scanlon
soothingly
that
nothing
at
all
the
young
man
brain
is
a
quick
one
proceeded
any
one
who
follows
his
work
in
the
knows
that
he
at
once
began
to
cast
about
so
it
seems
to
me
for
a
way
of
concealing
his
guilt
he
took
her
to
her
room
and
came
down
once
more
to
the
allowing
for
a
proper
passage
of
time
he
then
asked
the
nurse
to
call
in
the
police
to
them
he
told
the
story
which
he
afterward
repeated
to
the
coroner
physician
that
his
father
had
met
his
death
in
the
space
which
had
elapsed
between
his
taking
his
sister
to
her
room
and
his
return
to
the
bat
looked
at
nora
in
the
of
the
car
her
face
was
drawn
and
despairing
there
was
not
a
ray
of
hope
in
scanlon
own
breast
and
patiently
he
listened
as
the
quiet
voice
of
the
investigator
went
on
the
between
the
young
man
and
the
girl
during
their
examination
by
shower
which
you
reported
so
graphically
to
me
took
my
attention
he
must
have
seen
suspicion
heading
his
way
and
yet
he
took
no
real
steps
to
prevent
it
and
then
there
was
something
else
you
reported
that
he
had
appeared
in
the
after
you
had
gone
there
with
osborne
and
shower
to
examine
the
body
and
his
anxiety
then
concerning
the
nature
of
the
instrument
used
in
the
commission
of
the
crime
struck
me
as
being
a
bit
unusual
he
seemed
to
dread
apparently
that
this
would
be
shown
to
be
something
caught
up
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
something
belonging
in
the
room
without
putting
it
in
so
many
words
he
seemed
to
insinuate
that
a
regulation
weapon
such
as
might
have
been
brought
into
the
house
by
an
unknown
had
been
used
in
this
i
seemed
to
detect
not
only
a
desire
to
throw
the
police
off
the
track
but
also
the
existence
of
an
element
of
hope
in
the
back
of
his
mind
was
the
thought
that
after
all
his
sister
might
not
be
guilty
if
the
weapon
used
was
not
one
that
had
been
ready
to
her
hand
there
was
a
chance
that
she
was
innocent
however
the
finding
of
the
candlestick
must
have
dissipated
this
hope
and
when
they
charged
him
with
the
crime
he
merely
denied
it
he
i
think
feared
to
do
or
say
anything
which
might
direct
the
attention
of
the
police
definitely
away
from
himself
for
in
doing
this
they
might
chance
to
think
of
his
sister
but
said
nora
you
have
no
proof
that
all
of
this
is
true
not
proof
said
smiling
but
there
are
certain
almost
unmistakable
indications
one
of
these
i
brought
about
by
my
confidence
to
the
police
regarding
the
possibility
of
a
woman
being
connected
with
the
case
i
felt
that
if
he
believed
his
sister
guilty
that
this
would
stir
him
to
some
further
action
it
did
as
you
know
he
instantly
canceled
his
denials
and
admitted
the
crime
tell
me
said
scanlon
have
you
ever
thought
that
maybe
some
one
else
had
done
this
thing
has
your
mind
always
been
fixed
on
these
two
for
example
did
you
also
once
think
miss
cavanaugh
had
a
part
in
it
not
for
a
moment
smiled
not
even
when
i
told
you
how
i
seen
her
at
bohlmier
not
even
then
of
course
i
did
know
the
explanation
of
that
and
at
once
set
about
finding
one
fuller
was
put
to
work
looking
up
bohlmier
and
in
one
day
had
his
record
complete
the
man
is
a
skilful
blackmailer
he
has
practiced
in
many
cities
and
has
served
more
than
one
term
in
jail
i
knew
at
once
what
had
occurred
the
two
men
fancied
they
something
on
miss
cavanaugh
regarding
this
murder
and
had
endeavored
to
extort
money
from
her
i
leave
it
to
you
with
a
smiling
nod
toward
nora
to
tell
how
near
i
am
to
the
facts
the
girl
made
a
unintelligible
reply
and
then
they
ran
on
for
some
distance
in
silence
suddenly
signaled
the
driver
and
the
car
came
to
a
stand
the
investigator
pointed
to
some
buildings
at
no
great
distance
a
locomotive
with
a
few
cars
trailing
behind
it
was
panting
laboriously
away
from
these
its
headlight
glaring
morosely
into
the
darkness
i
think
said
the
investigator
that
is
stanwick
station
it
is
agreed
scanlon
then
more
than
likely
that
is
the
train
which
carried
fenton
and
fuller
i
suppose
it
would
be
as
well
if
we
got
out
here
and
walked
the
remainder
of
the
way
accordingly
they
alighted
and
the
driver
was
instructed
to
wait
where
he
was
then
they
proceeded
toward
duncan
street
reaching
which
they
turned
into
it
and
soon
were
in
the
neighborhood
of
no
they
paused
in
the
shadows
in
which
bat
scanlon
had
spoken
to
the
old
resident
the
house
opposite
seemed
dark
and
silent
no
one
stirring
said
bat
this
whole
section
can
be
as
quiet
a
place
as
i
know
of
when
it
takes
the
notion
who
had
been
straining
his
eyes
through
the
darkness
now
placed
his
fingers
to
his
lips
and
gave
a
peculiar
whistle
after
a
moment
there
was
an
answer
to
this
and
then
a
figure
emerged
from
the
shadow
of
the
burton
house
in
a
very
little
while
longer
fuller
crossed
the
street
to
them
what
news
asked
the
investigator
briefly
fenton
is
in
the
house
answered
fuller
i
followed
him
from
the
train
he
went
to
the
front
door
rang
in
the
regular
way
and
was
admitted
by
what
looked
to
me
to
be
a
nurse
had
he
any
idea
he
was
followed
i
think
not
he
made
no
show
of
it
anyhow
suppose
you
stay
here
and
keep
quigley
company
for
a
few
minutes
suggested
we
like
to
look
around
a
bit
i
am
not
accustomed
to
the
night
air
complained
the
broker
it
has
a
bad
effect
upon
my
breathing
we
shall
be
only
a
very
little
while
he
was
assured
crossed
the
street
with
nora
and
scanlon
at
his
side
quietly
they
entered
at
the
little
iron
gate
and
stood
for
a
space
examining
the
house
from
the
fan
light
above
the
front
door
came
a
dull
glow
as
though
a
subdued
light
burned
in
the
hall
all
the
shutters
are
closed
said
bat
as
he
noticed
this
fact
they
may
be
brightly
lighted
inside
and
we
not
know
it
the
keen
searching
eyes
of
caught
a
sort
of
glow
upon
the
grass
at
one
side
he
moved
in
that
direction
and
the
others
followed
him
at
the
second
floor
a
light
flickered
dimly
in
a
window
it
was
a
wavering
uncertain
sort
of
thing
and
bat
scanlon
recognized
it
at
once
it
said
he
remember
i
told
you
about
seeing
the
girl
here
he
felt
nora
cold
hand
close
upon
his
wrist
at
the
window
appeared
the
figure
of
mary
burton
in
the
same
loose
gown
as
before
and
holding
a
candle
in
her
hand
the
light
was
full
upon
her
face
as
she
bent
forward
as
though
intent
upon
catching
some
sound
and
the
face
was
white
and
rigid
with
fear
have
you
looked
through
the
upper
part
of
the
house
asked
scanlon
no
replied
bat
i
have
said
the
other
that
window
is
right
at
the
head
of
a
stairway
something
is
being
said
or
done
upon
the
lower
floor
which
rather
upsets
her
he
moved
forward
as
he
spoke
beneath
the
window
above
was
a
square
heavily
made
shutter
different
from
the
others
in
shape
and
marking
a
hall
window
as
they
were
about
to
pass
it
uttered
a
low
exclamation
and
stopped
suddenly
the
shutter
was
badly
fitted
having
swollen
with
the
weather
so
that
it
could
not
be
completely
closed
the
slim
strong
fingers
of
gripped
its
edge
slowly
carefully
with
never
a
creak
it
opened
there
was
a
white
curtain
inside
but
a
pendant
light
made
all
things
in
the
hall
visible
a
flight
of
stairs
led
to
the
second
floor
and
at
the
foot
of
these
stood
fenton
one
hand
upon
the
rail
and
the
nurse
with
frightened
face
was
pleading
with
him
as
though
not
to
do
something
which
he
had
signified
his
intention
of
doing
ah
scanlon
heard
breathe
so
that
your
game
is
it
then
to
bat
stay
here
keep
an
eye
on
that
fellow
and
be
ready
to
act
with
these
words
he
slipped
easily
away
into
the
darkness
and
scanlon
and
nora
were
left
alone
at
the
window
he
is
demanding
to
be
allowed
to
see
mary
said
the
trembling
voice
of
nora
in
bat
ear
and
the
poor
nurse
is
terrified
see
how
she
tries
to
stop
him
with
a
sort
of
snarl
the
man
threw
off
the
detaining
hand
of
the
nurse
and
turned
a
threatening
face
upon
her
at
the
same
time
gesturing
toward
the
upper
floor
and
signifying
his
intention
of
ascending
in
spite
of
anything
the
girl
might
say
but
she
got
grit
said
bat
in
a
low
tone
of
admiration
she
hangs
to
him
the
girl
is
her
patient
and
she
not
have
her
frightened
it
part
of
the
training
they
get
i
guess
fenton
let
go
the
stair
rail
and
made
a
step
toward
the
nurse
his
ugly
face
was
distorted
and
his
hands
were
clenched
he
began
to
speak
what
he
said
could
not
be
heard
by
the
watchers
outside
the
window
but
the
nurse
seemed
terrified
and
shrank
from
him
he
down
to
cases
now
said
scanlon
as
he
deftly
freed
his
revolver
and
held
it
ready
but
in
such
a
way
that
nora
could
not
see
it
look
whispered
nora
thrillingly
look
bat
on
the
stairs
bat
scanlon
shifted
his
eyes
from
the
threatening
figure
of
fenton
and
the
shrinking
one
of
the
nurse
upon
the
stairs
coming
slowly
down
her
loose
held
about
her
by
one
slim
hand
was
mary
burton
she
had
reached
the
foot
of
the
stairs
before
the
man
saw
her
then
he
whirled
about
and
his
hands
gripped
her
delicate
throat
scanlon
revolver
arose
to
a
deadly
level
but
before
he
could
fire
was
seen
to
leap
into
the
hall
like
a
panther
there
was
a
short
sharp
blow
with
all
the
power
of
the
lithe
body
behind
it
fenton
grasp
relaxed
and
he
fell
to
the
floor
the
watchers
saw
mary
totter
and
noted
catch
her
in
his
arms
at
the
same
time
gesturing
to
the
nurse
to
bring
a
restorative
the
nurse
had
vanished
and
was
placing
the
sick
girl
upon
a
hall
lounge
when
nora
and
scanlon
hurried
from
the
window
and
around
to
the
door
this
stood
wide
open
and
they
encountered
fuller
and
the
pawnbroker
quigley
as
they
entered
in
the
hall
they
saw
fenton
rising
sullenly
to
his
feet
one
hand
feeling
at
his
jaw
was
bending
over
the
white
fragile
creature
upon
the
lounge
there
she
is
said
scanlon
pointing
to
mary
and
looking
at
quigley
there
she
is
pile
it
all
on
her
shoulders
she
strong
and
can
stand
it
say
your
say
and
then
beat
it
for
by
george
i
wo
be
able
to
stand
the
sight
of
you
afterward
quigley
looked
at
the
speaker
in
surprise
then
his
puffy
eyes
went
to
mary
with
a
deepening
of
their
astonishment
and
finally
to
is
this
the
lady
you
had
in
mind
said
he
if
so
you
have
made
a
mistake
she
is
not
the
person
who
sold
me
the
diamonds
nora
cavanaugh
gave
a
gasping
sort
of
cry
and
stood
staring
at
the
pawnbroker
her
wide
eyes
full
of
joy
of
bewilderment
at
that
moment
a
set
of
hangings
were
pushed
aside
and
the
nurse
came
into
the
hall
a
glass
in
her
hand
silently
touched
quigley
upon
the
arm
and
pointed
to
the
nurse
the
man
started
and
then
regarded
her
intently
yes
said
he
yes
that
is
the
woman
i
can
take
my
oath
on
that
in
any
court
in
the
land
the
woman
stood
motionless
for
a
moment
she
drew
in
a
long
breath
the
glass
fell
to
the
floor
and
smashed
then
she
disappeared
once
more
through
the
door
by
which
she
entered
fuller
said
but
he
had
no
need
to
speak
for
that
brisk
young
man
was
already
after
her
dazed
bat
scanlon
looked
about
nora
was
upon
her
knees
beside
the
sick
girl
sobbing
and
chafing
her
pale
hands
the
investigator
was
at
a
telephone
summoning
the
police
scanlon
glance
then
wandered
to
fenton
and
there
rested
you
told
us
a
couple
of
hours
ago
said
he
that
a
woman
killed
tom
burton
and
that
you
saw
her
do
it
has
he
and
he
nodded
toward
quigley
got
it
on
the
right
party
yes
replied
the
man
he
got
it
right
it
was
the
nurse
you
do
have
to
look
any
further
than
that
but
said
bat
a
last
doubt
in
his
mind
what
was
the
idea
of
you
wanting
to
go
a
while
ago
if
you
did
want
her
pointing
to
mary
it
was
the
sparks
i
wanted
said
fenton
i
thought
if
any
were
left
they
were
in
the
nurse
room
next
morning
nora
cavanaugh
still
very
pale
but
with
a
light
in
her
eyes
such
as
had
not
been
there
for
many
days
sat
snugly
in
the
corner
of
a
sofa
at
her
home
wrapped
about
in
a
beautiful
old
shawl
near
by
sat
bat
scanlon
and
standing
before
them
his
hat
and
stick
in
his
hand
as
though
about
to
leave
was
i
admit
the
big
athlete
was
saying
when
the
thing
was
finally
brought
down
to
a
woman
and
nora
was
eliminated
with
a
smiling
nod
toward
her
i
could
see
nobody
but
mary
burton
the
nurse
never
occurred
to
me
and
yet
seem
to
have
suspected
her
from
the
start
said
nora
her
eyes
wonderingly
on
the
criminologist
why
was
that
it
began
with
the
candlestick
the
weapon
used
in
the
commission
of
the
murder
candlesticks
go
in
pairs
usually
i
found
the
mate
to
it
on
a
shelf
in
the
room
across
the
hall
from
the
that
in
which
the
nurse
sat
reading
when
tom
burton
was
admitted
to
the
house
that
one
of
a
pair
of
candlesticks
should
be
in
the
and
one
in
the
room
opposite
struck
me
as
being
unusual
later
i
spoke
to
the
maid
of
this
she
said
they
both
belonged
in
the
room
on
the
shelf
where
i
found
the
second
one
nora
gave
a
little
gasp
and
her
hand
went
to
her
heart
it
is
horrible
she
said
while
on
my
second
visit
to
duncan
street
i
was
at
pains
to
note
one
of
the
nurse
shoes
it
was
of
a
peculiarly
comfortable
make
the
same
as
those
which
made
the
prints
at
the
rose
arbor
these
two
things
rather
centered
my
attention
upon
her
and
i
began
to
pry
into
her
record
burgess
one
of
my
men
went
as
far
as
new
orleans
looking
her
up
a
number
of
things
were
found
against
her
a
few
rather
startling
she
seemed
a
woman
given
to
criminal
impulses
and
just
the
sort
who
would
perpetrate
a
thing
such
as
the
stanwick
affair
and
she
had
a
good
face
said
nora
i
had
specially
noticed
it
to
think
and
the
girl
shivered
that
she
should
have
been
a
suicide
locked
in
her
room
when
the
police
came
fuller
made
a
mistake
in
waiting
when
she
refused
to
open
the
door
said
he
should
have
broken
it
in
her
story
of
how
the
murder
was
done
would
have
been
interesting
said
scanlon
i
think
i
can
with
fenton
statement
to
help
out
supply
the
main
points
said
the
investigator
but
of
course
they
will
lack
the
personal
touch
as
i
have
worked
it
out
she
sat
reading
just
as
she
said
and
she
heard
a
greater
part
of
what
was
talked
of
in
the
between
burton
and
his
daughter
and
afterward
the
son
i
have
learned
why
the
elder
burton
went
there
that
night
it
was
to
call
up
and
confer
with
a
shady
dealer
in
diamonds
just
such
another
as
quigley
i
have
talked
with
this
man
he
said
he
had
a
call
from
the
bounder
who
told
him
he
had
a
rich
haul
to
dispose
of
the
time
of
this
call
and
the
time
of
the
bounder
presence
at
no
duncan
street
was
the
same
but
the
place
where
they
were
to
meet
was
never
given
to
the
dealer
for
the
call
terminated
abruptly
in
a
confusion
of
voices
and
then
a
blank
silence
which
told
him
that
the
receiver
had
been
hung
up
i
explain
this
by
reasoning
it
out
that
young
burton
indignant
at
what
was
going
forward
had
torn
his
father
away
from
the
instrument
before
the
conversation
had
ended
but
if
this
is
so
why
did
the
bounder
ever
go
to
no
duncan
street
to
carry
out
a
deal
for
stolen
diamonds
asked
scanlon
there
were
many
perfectly
safe
places
he
could
have
picked
the
answer
to
that
probably
lies
in
the
nature
of
the
man
he
hated
his
son
and
daughter
he
knew
his
rascally
doings
gave
them
pain
and
it
may
have
occurred
to
him
as
a
delicious
piece
of
humor
to
do
this
particular
thing
before
their
eyes
depending
upon
their
shame
to
keep
them
silent
afterward
all
this
talk
of
diamonds
attracted
the
attention
of
the
listening
nurse
she
finally
stole
out
of
the
house
took
up
the
position
at
the
rose
arbor
and
watched
what
was
happening
in
the
while
she
was
doing
this
i
think
young
burton
must
have
gone
where
he
was
afterward
seen
by
the
maid
from
what
fenton
has
told
the
police
he
was
looking
in
at
the
window
when
he
saw
mary
burton
faint
no
one
was
then
in
the
room
but
the
girl
and
her
father
and
as
the
latter
bent
over
her
fenton
saw
the
door
open
and
the
nurse
steal
into
the
room
the
brass
candlestick
in
her
hand
the
jewels
were
upon
the
table
where
the
bounder
had
placed
them
at
the
moment
his
daughter
fell
the
nurse
snatched
them
up
and
as
she
did
so
the
man
turned
his
head
and
saw
her
he
leaped
toward
her
and
she
struck
him
to
the
floor
without
a
moment
hesitation
she
lifted
the
window
and
dropped
the
candlestick
within
two
feet
of
where
fenton
was
crouched
then
she
left
the
room
the
sounds
made
by
these
happenings
are
probably
what
young
burton
was
listening
to
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
when
the
colored
maid
saw
him
and
my
version
of
what
he
did
after
he
descended
the
stairs
you
have
already
heard
the
brother
thought
the
sister
was
the
criminal
and
when
the
sister
came
out
of
her
swoon
i
heard
her
admit
as
much
to
her
brother
this
morning
when
he
was
released
from
prison
her
mind
was
burdened
with
the
belief
that
was
guilty
and
so
both
were
silent
for
each
other
sake
but
mary
prowling
about
the
house
with
the
candle
as
i
saw
her
that
night
said
scanlon
what
do
you
make
of
that
mary
burton
has
a
good
mind
though
she
lacks
when
the
jewels
were
not
found
upon
her
father
body
or
in
the
room
where
he
was
killed
she
realized
they
had
been
stolen
but
by
whom
she
knew
her
brother
too
well
to
think
he
was
the
thief
and
i
think
from
that
moment
she
began
to
suspect
the
nurse
once
as
a
report
of
one
of
my
men
states
as
the
nurse
left
the
house
secretly
and
with
a
veil
over
her
face
mary
was
seen
at
a
window
the
curtain
partly
drawn
aside
looking
after
her
i
think
her
going
about
through
the
rooms
with
the
candle
was
an
effort
to
locate
the
possible
hiding
place
of
the
diamonds
nora
gave
a
deep
sigh
poor
thing
and
to
think
how
very
brave
she
was
well
and
showed
unmistakable
signs
of
going
i
suppose
their
troubles
from
that
source
at
least
are
over
nora
arose
and
held
out
her
hand
that
it
is
she
said
is
due
to
you
and
i
thank
you
for
the
peace
you
have
brought
to
us
all
released
the
hand
after
a
moment
it
was
one
of
those
things
which
would
probably
have
unraveled
itself
said
he
however
with
a
nod
and
a
smile
which
showed
his
flashing
white
teeth
you
never
can
tell
so
it
just
as
well
perhaps
that
it
was
permitted
to
run
its
course
he
paused
in
the
doorway
the
trim
maid
waiting
to
show
him
out
that
you
are
a
friend
of
scanlon
means
a
great
deal
to
me
said
he
i
do
a
great
deal
for
him
for
you
know
he
one
of
the
very
best
fellows
in
the
world
and
the
last
thing
he
saw
as
he
vanished
through
the
doorway
was
the
undoubted
blush
which
colored
the
face
of
scanlon
and
the
light
in
the
beautiful
eyes
of
nora
cavanaugh
as
she
turned
to
look
at
him
