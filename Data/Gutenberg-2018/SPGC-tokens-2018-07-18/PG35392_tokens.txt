i
crossing
the

what
do
you
do
for
mines
i
put
the
question
to
the
dear
old
salt
at
folkestone
quay
as
i
am
waiting
to
go
on
board
the
boat
for
belgium
this
burning
august
night
the
dear
old
salt
thinks
hard
for
an
answer
very
hard
indeed
then
he
scratches
his
head
there
ai
none
he
makes
reply
all
the
same
in
spite
of
the
dear
old
salt
i
feel
rather
creepy
as
the
boat
starts
off
that
hot
summer
night
and
through
the
darkness
we
begin
to
plough
our
way
to
ostend
over
the
dark
waters
the
old
english
battleships
send
their
vivid
flashes
unceasingly
but
it
is
not
a
comfortable
feeling
to
think
you
may
be
blown
up
at
any
minute
and
i
spend
the
hours
on
deck
i
notice
our
little
belgian
captain
is
looking
very
sad
and
dejected
they
saying
in
belgium
now
that
our
poor
soldiers
are
getting
all
the
brunt
of
it
he
says
despondently
to
a
group
of
sympathetic
gathered
round
him
on
deck
chattering
and
trying
to
pick
up
bits
of
news
but
that
will
all
be
made
up
says
martin
donohue
the
australian
who
is
among
the
crowd
all
that
you
lose
will
be
given
back
to
belgium
before
long
they
can
not
give
us
back
our
the
little
captain
answers
dully
and
no
one
makes
reply
to
that
there
is
no
reply
to
make
it
is
four
in
the
morning
instead
of
nine
at
night
when
we
get
to
ostend
at
last
and
the
first
red
gleams
of
sunrise
are
already
flashing
in
the
east
we
leave
the
boat
cross
the
customs
and
after
much
ringing
wake
up
the
belgian
at
the
hotel
in
we
troop
two
english
nurses
twenty
and
an
australian
girl
in
belgium
rooms
are
distributed
to
us
great
white
lofty
rooms
with
private
bathrooms
attached
very
magnificent
indeed
then
for
a
few
hours
we
sleep
to
be
awakened
by
a
gorgeous
morning
golden
and
glittering
that
shews
the
sea
a
lovely
blue
but
a
very
sad
deserted
town
poor
ostend
once
she
had
been
the
very
gayest
of
birds
but
now
her
feathers
are
stripped
she
is
bare
and
shivery
her
big
white
beautiful
hotels
have
dark
blinds
over
all
their
windows
her
long
line
of
blank
closed
fronts
of
houses
and
hotels
seems
to
go
on
for
miles
just
here
and
there
one
is
open
but
for
the
most
everything
is
dead
and
indeed
it
is
almost
impossible
to
recognise
in
this
haunted
place
the
most
brilliant
seaside
city
in
europe
it
is
only
seven
but
all
ostend
seems
up
and
about
as
i
enter
the
big
salon
and
order
coffee
and
rolls
suddenly
a
noise
is
heard
shouts
wheels
something
indescribable
everyone
jumps
up
and
runs
down
the
long
white
restaurant
out
on
the
station
we
run
and
just
then
a
motor
dashes
past
us
coming
right
inside
under
the
station
roof
it
is
full
of
men
and
one
is
wounded
my
blood
turns
suddenly
cold
i
have
never
seen
a
wounded
soldier
before
i
remember
quite
well
i
said
to
myself
then
it
is
true
i
had
never
really
believed
before
now
they
are
lifting
him
out
oh
so
tenderly
these
four
other
big
burly
belgians
and
they
have
laid
him
on
a
stretcher
he
lies
there
on
his
back
his
face
is
quite
red
he
has
a
bald
head
he
does
look
a
bit
like
my
idea
of
a
wounded
soldier
and
his
expression
remains
unchanged
it
is
still
the
quiet
stolid
patient
belgian
look
that
one
sees
in
scores
in
hundreds
all
around
and
now
they
are
carrying
him
tenderly
on
to
the
red
cross
ship
drawn
up
at
the
station
pier
and
after
a
while
we
all
go
back
and
try
and
finish
our
coffee
barely
have
we
sat
down
again
before
more
shouts
are
heard
immediately
everybody
is
up
and
out
on
to
the
station
and
another
motor
car
full
of
soldiers
comes
dashing
in
under
the
great
glassed
roofs
excitement
rises
to
fever
heat
now
out
of
the
car
is
dragged
a
and
one
can
never
forget
one
first
german
never
shall
i
forget
that
wounded
uhlan
one
of
his
hands
is
shot
off
his
face
is
black
with
smoke
and
dirt
and
powder
across
his
cheek
is
a
dark
heavy
mark
where
a
belgian
had
struck
him
for
trying
to
throttle
one
of
his
captors
in
the
car
he
is
a
wretch
a
brute
he
has
been
caught
with
the
red
cross
on
one
arm
and
a
revolver
in
one
pocket
but
there
is
yet
something
cruelly
magnificent
about
the
fellow
as
he
puts
on
that
tremendous
swagger
and
marches
down
the
long
platform
between
two
lines
of
foes
to
meet
his
fate
as
he
passes
very
close
to
me
i
look
right
into
his
face
and
it
is
imprinted
on
my
memory
for
all
time
he
is
a
big
typical
uhlan
with
round
head
blue
eyes
arrogant
lips
large
ears
big
and
heavy
of
build
but
what
impresses
me
is
that
he
is
no
coward
he
knows
his
destiny
he
will
be
shot
for
a
certainty
shot
for
wearing
the
red
cross
while
carrying
weapons
but
he
really
is
a
splendid
devil
as
he
goes
strutting
down
the
long
platform
between
the
gendarmes
all
alone
among
his
enemies
alone
in
the
last
moments
of
his
life
then
a
door
opens
he
passes
in
the
door
shuts
he
will
be
seen
no
more
all
is
panic
now
we
know
the
truth
the
germans
have
made
a
sudden
sortie
and
are
attacking
just
at
the
edge
of
ostend
the
gendarmes
are
fighting
them
and
are
keeping
them
back
then
a
boy
scout
rushes
in
on
a
motor
cycle
and
asks
for
the
red
cross
to
be
sent
out
at
once
and
then
and
there
it
musters
in
the
of
the
hotel
and
rushes
off
in
motor
cars
to
the
scene
of
action
then
another
car
dashes
in
with
another
uhlan
who
has
been
shot
in
the
back
and
now
i
watch
the
belgians
lifting
their
enemy
out
all
look
of
fight
goes
out
of
their
faces
as
they
raise
him
just
as
gently
just
as
tenderly
as
they
have
raised
their
own
wounded
man
a
few
moments
ago
and
carry
him
on
to
their
red
cross
ship
just
as
carefully
and
pitifully
quick
quick
a
hastens
up
there
not
a
minute
to
lose
the
kaiser
has
given
orders
that
all
english
will
be
shot
on
sight
the
germans
will
be
here
any
minute
they
will
cut
the
telegraph
wires
stop
the
boats
and
shoot
everyone
connected
with
a
newspaper
the
prospect
finally
drives
us
with
a
crowd
on
to
the
boat
and
so
exactly
six
hours
after
we
landed
we
rush
back
again
to
england
among
the
crowd
are
italians
belgians
british
and
a
couple
of
americans
an
old
franciscan
priest
sits
down
and
philosophically
tucks
into
a
hearty
lunch
belgian
priests
crouch
about
in
attitudes
of
great
depression
poor
priests
they
know
how
the
germans
treat
priests
in
this
holy
war
chapter
ii
on
the
way
to
antwerp
a
couple
of
days
afterward
however
feeling
thoroughly
ashamed
of
having
fled
and
knowing
that
ostend
was
now
reinforced
by
english
marines
i
gathered
my
courage
together
once
more
and
returned
to
belgium
this
time
so
that
i
should
not
run
away
again
so
easily
i
took
with
me
a
and
a
couple
of
trunks
these
trunks
contained
clothes
enough
to
last
a
summer
and
a
winter
the
of
a
novel
our
marriage
which
had
appeared
serially
and
all
my
chiffons
in
fact
i
took
everything
i
had
in
my
wardrobe
i
thought
it
was
the
simplest
thing
to
do
so
it
was
but
it
afterwards
proved
an
equally
simple
way
of
losing
all
i
had
getting
back
to
ostend
i
left
my
luggage
at
the
maritime
hotel
and
hurried
to
the
railway
station
i
had
determined
to
go
to
antwerp
for
the
day
and
see
if
it
would
be
possible
to
make
my
headquarters
in
that
town
pas
de
train
said
the
ticket
official
but
why
la
guerre
comment
la
guerre
madame
that
was
the
answer
one
received
to
all
one
queries
in
those
days
if
you
asked
why
the
post
had
not
come
or
why
the
boat
did
not
sail
for
england
or
why
your
coffee
was
cold
or
why
your
boots
were
not
cleaned
or
why
your
window
was
shut
or
why
the
canary
sing
you
would
always
be
sure
to
be
told
la
guerre
next
morning
however
the
train
condescended
to
start
and
three
hours
after
its
proper
time
we
steamed
away
from
ostend
slowly
painfully
through
the
hot
summer
day
our
long
brown
train
went
creeping
towards
anvers
anvers
the
very
name
had
grown
into
an
emblem
of
hope
in
those
sad
days
when
the
belgians
were
fleeing
for
their
lives
towards
the
safety
of
their
great
fortified
city
on
the
scheldt
oh
to
see
them
at
every
station
crushing
in
in
they
crowd
and
in
they
crowd
herding
like
dumb
driven
cattle
and
always
the
poor
women
with
their
wide
innocent
eyes
had
babies
in
their
arms
and
little
flemish
children
hanging
to
their
skirts
wherever
we
stopped
we
found
the
platforms
lined
ten
deep
and
by
the
wildness
with
which
these
fugitives
fought
their
way
into
the
crowded
carriages
one
guessed
at
the
terror
in
those
poor
hearts
they
they
get
into
that
train
you
could
see
it
was
a
matter
of
life
and
death
with
them
and
soon
every
compartment
was
packed
and
on
we
went
through
the
stifling
blinding
august
day
onwards
towards
antwerp
but
when
a
soldier
came
along
how
eager
everyone
was
to
find
a
place
for
him
not
one
of
us
but
would
gladly
give
up
our
seat
to
any
we
would
lean
from
the
windows
and
shout
out
loudly
almost
imploringly
here
soldat
and
when
two
wounded
men
from
malines
appeared
we
performed
absolute
miracles
of
compression
in
that
long
brown
train
we
squeezed
ourselves
to
nothing
we
stood
in
back
rows
on
the
seats
while
front
rows
sat
on
our
toes
and
the
passage
between
the
seats
was
packed
so
closely
that
one
could
scarcely
insert
a
pin
and
still
we
squeezed
ourselves
and
still
fresh
passengers
came
clambering
in
and
so
wonderful
was
the
spirit
of
goodwill
abroad
in
these
desperate
days
in
belgium
that
we
kept
on
making
room
for
them
even
when
there
was
absolutely
no
more
room
to
make
then
a
soldier
began
talking
and
how
we
listened
never
did
priest
or
orator
get
such
a
hearing
as
that
little
belgian
white
with
dust
clotted
with
blood
and
mud
his
yellow
beard
weeks
old
on
his
young
face
with
his
poor
feet
in
their
broken
boots
the
original
blue
and
red
of
his
coat
blackened
with
smoke
and
hardened
with
earth
where
he
had
slept
among
the
and
potatoes
at
malines
he
told
us
in
a
faint
voice
i
often
saw
king
albert
when
i
was
fighting
near
malines
yes
he
was
there
our
king
he
was
fighting
too
i
saw
him
many
times
i
was
quite
near
him
ah
he
has
a
bravery
and
magnificence
about
him
i
saw
a
shell
exploding
just
a
bare
yard
from
where
he
was
over
and
over
again
i
saw
his
face
always
calm
and
resolute
i
hope
all
is
well
with
him
he
ended
falteringly
but
in
battle
one
knows
nothing
yes
yes
all
is
well
answered
a
dozen
voices
king
albert
is
back
at
antwerp
and
safe
with
the
queen
a
look
of
radiant
happiness
flashed
over
the
poor
fellow
face
as
he
heard
that
then
he
made
us
all
laugh
he
said
for
two
days
i
slept
out
in
the
fields
at
first
among
the
potatoes
and
the
and
then
i
came
to
the
asparagus
he
drew
himself
up
a
bit
the
asparagus
of
malines
it
is
the
best
asparagus
in
the
world
ça
and
i
slept
on
it
on
the
malines
asparagus
about
noon
that
day
we
had
arrived
close
to
ghent
when
suddenly
the
train
came
to
a
standstill
and
we
were
ordered
to
get
out
and
told
to
wait
on
the
platform
two
hours
to
wait
the
stationmaster
told
us
the
grey
old
city
of
ghent
calm
and
massive
among
her
monuments
looked
as
though
war
were
a
hundred
miles
away
the
shops
were
all
open
business
was
being
briskly
done
ladies
were
buying
gloves
and
ribbons
old
gentlemen
were
smoking
their
big
cigars
here
and
there
was
a
belgian
officer
the
shops
were
full
of
english
papers
i
went
into
the
cathedral
it
was
saturday
morning
but
great
crowds
of
people
peasants
bourgeoisie
and
aristocracy
were
there
praying
and
telling
their
rosaries
and
as
i
entered
a
priest
was
finishing
his
sermon
remember
this
my
children
remember
this
said
the
little
priest
only
silence
is
great
the
rest
is
weakness
it
has
often
seemed
to
me
since
that
those
words
hold
the
to
the
belgian
character
la
silence
est
grande
la
reste
est
for
never
does
one
hear
a
belgian
complain
at
last
over
the
flat
green
country
came
a
glimpse
of
antwerp
a
great
city
lying
stretched
out
on
the
flat
lands
that
border
the
river
scheldt
from
the
one
saw
a
bewildering
mass
of
all
gathered
together
in
the
middle
of
the
green
fields
at
the
outskirts
for
all
the
had
been
commandeered
by
the
government
and
near
them
was
a
field
covered
with
monoplanes
and
biplanes
a
magnificent
array
of
aircraft
of
every
kind
with
the
sunlight
glittering
over
them
like
silver
they
were
all
ready
there
to
chase
the
zeppelin
when
it
came
over
from
cologne
and
in
the
a
ceaseless
activity
went
on
slowly
and
painfully
our
train
crept
into
antwerp
station
the
pomp
and
spaciousness
of
this
building
with
its
immense
roof
was
very
striking
it
was
the
second
largest
station
in
the
world
and
in
those
days
it
had
need
to
be
large
for
the
crowds
that
poured
out
of
the
trains
were
appalling
all
the
world
seemed
to
be
rushing
into
the
fortified
town
soldiers
were
everywhere
and
for
the
first
time
i
saw
men
armed
to
the
teeth
with
bayonets
drawn
looking
stern
and
implacable
and
i
soon
found
it
was
a
very
terrible
affair
to
get
inside
the
city
i
had
to
wait
and
wait
in
a
dense
crowd
for
quite
an
hour
before
i
could
get
to
the
first
line
of
sentinels
then
i
shewed
my
passport
and
papers
while
two
belgian
sentinels
stood
on
each
side
of
me
their
bayonets
horribly
near
my
head
out
in
the
flagged
square
i
got
a
fiacre
and
started
off
for
a
drive
my
first
impression
of
antwerp
as
i
drove
through
it
that
golden
day
was
something
never
never
to
be
forgotten
as
long
as
i
live
i
shall
see
that
great
city
walled
in
all
round
with
magnificent
fortifications
standing
ready
for
the
siege
along
the
curbstones
armed
guards
were
stationed
bayonets
fixed
while
dense
crowds
seethed
up
and
down
continually
in
the
golden
sunlight
thousands
of
banners
were
floating
in
the
wind
enormous
banners
of
a
size
such
as
i
had
never
seen
before
hanging
out
of
these
great
white
stately
houses
along
the
avenues
lined
with
acacias
there
were
banners
fluttering
out
of
the
shops
along
the
chaussée
de
malines
banners
floating
from
the
beautiful
cathedral
banners
banners
everywhere
hour
after
hour
i
drove
and
everywhere
there
were
banners
golden
red
and
black
floating
on
the
breeze
it
seemed
to
me
that
that
black
struck
a
curiously
sombre
note
almost
a
note
of
warning
and
i
confess
that
i
did
not
quite
like
it
and
i
even
thought
to
myself
that
if
i
were
a
belgian
i
would
raise
heaven
and
earth
to
have
the
black
taken
out
of
my
national
flag
alas
one
little
dreamed
that
golden
summer
day
of
the
tragic
fate
that
lay
in
wait
for
antwerp
in
those
days
we
all
believed
her
utterly
impregnable
after
a
long
drive
i
drove
to
the
hotel
terminus
to
get
a
cup
of
tea
and
arrange
for
my
stay
it
gave
me
a
feeling
of
surprise
to
walk
into
a
beautiful
corridor
and
see
people
sitting
about
drinking
cool
drinks
and
eating
ices
there
were
dauntless
belgian
officers
in
their
picturesque
uniforms
french
and
english
business
men
and
a
sprinkling
of
french
and
english
a
tall
charming
american
lady
with
the
red
cross
on
her
black
chiffon
sleeve
was
having
tea
with
her
husband
a
american
army
doctor
these
were
major
and
livingstone
seaman
a
wealthy
philanthropic
american
couple
who
were
devoting
their
lives
and
their
substance
to
helping
red
cross
work
suddenly
a
man
came
towards
me
you
do
remember
me
he
said
you
are
from
australia
i
met
you
fifteen
years
ago
in
sydney
it
was
a
strange
meeting
that
of
two
australians
who
were
destined
later
on
to
face
such
terrific
odds
in
that
city
on
the
scheldt
my
orders
are
frank
fox
told
me
as
we
chatted
away
to
stick
it
out
whatever
happens
i
got
to
see
it
through
for
the
and
i
going
to
see
it
through
too
i
said
oh
no
said
fox
you
have
to
go
as
soon
as
trouble
threatens
shall
i
i
thought
but
as
he
was
a
man
and
an
australian
i
did
not
think
it
was
worth
while
arguing
the
matter
with
him
instead
we
talked
of
sydney
and
old
friends
across
the
seas
the
blue
mountains
and
the
bush
and
our
poets
and
writers
and
painters
and
politicians
friends
of
long
ago
forgetting
for
the
moment
that
we
were
chatting
as
it
were
on
the
edge
of
a
crater
chapter
iii
germans
on
the
line
i
was
coming
back
with
my
luggage
from
ostend
next
day
when
the
train
which
had
been
running
along
at
a
beautiful
speed
came
to
a
standstill
somewhere
near
bruges
there
was
a
long
wait
and
at
last
it
became
evident
that
something
was
wrong
a
belgian
general
accompanied
by
an
equally
brilliant
belgian
captain
who
had
travelled
up
in
the
train
with
me
from
ostend
informed
me
courteously
that
it
was
doubtful
if
the
train
would
go
on
what
has
happened
i
asked
allemands
sont
sur
la
ligne
was
the
graphic
answer
with
the
belgians
courteous
assistance
i
got
down
my
and
a
large
brown
paper
parcel
for
of
course
in
those
day
no
one
thought
anything
of
a
brown
paper
parcel
in
fact
it
was
quite
the
correct
thing
to
be
seen
carrying
one
no
matter
who
you
were
king
queen
general
prince
or
do
you
see
that
station
over
there
le
capitaine
said
well
in
a
few
hours
time
a
train
start
from
there
and
run
to
antwerp
but
it
will
not
arrive
at
the
ordinary
station
it
will
go
as
far
as
the
river
and
then
we
shall
get
on
board
a
steamer
and
cross
the
river
and
shall
arrive
at
antwerp
from
the
quay
picking
up
my
he
started
off
with
the
old
general
beside
him
carrying
my
parasols
while
i
held
my
brown
paper
parcel
firmly
under
one
arm
and
grasped
my
with
the
other
hand
i
was
just
thinking
to
myself
how
nice
it
was
to
have
a
general
and
a
capitaine
looking
after
me
when
to
my
supreme
disgust
my
brown
paper
parcel
burst
open
and
there
fell
out
an
evening
shoe
and
such
a
shoe
it
was
a
brilliant
blue
and
equally
brilliant
silver
with
a
very
high
heel
and
a
big
silver
buckle
it
was
a
shoe
i
loved
and
i
had
felt
like
leaving
it
behind
and
now
there
it
fell
on
the
station
witness
to
a
woman
vanity
however
the
belgian
captain
was
quite
equal
to
the
occasion
he
picked
it
up
and
presented
it
to
me
with
a
bow
and
said
in
unexpected
english
yourra
sabbath
shoe
it
was
good
to
have
little
incidents
like
that
to
brighten
journey
for
a
very
long
and
tedious
time
elapsed
before
we
arrived
at
antwerp
that
night
the
crowded
suffocating
train
crawled
along
and
stopped
half
an
hour
indiscriminately
every
now
and
then
and
we
wondered
if
the
germans
were
out
there
in
the
flat
fields
to
either
side
of
us
when
we
arrived
at
the
scheldt
i
trudged
wearily
on
to
the
big
river
steamboat
more
dead
than
alive
the
general
was
still
carrying
my
parasols
and
the
capitaine
still
clung
to
my
and
at
last
we
crossed
the
great
blue
scheldt
and
landed
on
the
other
side
where
a
row
of
armed
sentinels
presented
their
bayonets
at
us
and
kept
us
a
whole
hour
examining
our
passports
before
they
would
allow
us
to
enter
the
city
thanks
to
the
kindly
general
i
got
a
lift
in
a
motor
car
and
was
taken
straight
to
the
hotel
terminus
i
had
eaten
nothing
since
the
morning
but
the
sleepy
hotel
told
me
it
was
impossible
to
get
anything
at
that
hour
everything
was
locked
up
la
guerre
he
said
well
he
was
right
it
was
indeed
the
war
and
i
did
feel
that
i
had
any
call
to
complain
or
make
a
fuss
so
i
wearily
took
the
lift
up
to
my
bedroom
on
the
fourth
floor
and
speedily
fell
asleep
when
i
awoke
was
three
in
the
and
a
most
terrific
noise
was
going
on
it
was
pitch
dark
darker
than
any
words
can
say
up
there
in
my
bedroom
for
we
were
forbidden
lights
for
fear
of
zeppelins
all
day
long
i
had
been
travelling
through
belgium
and
all
day
long
it
seemed
to
me
i
had
been
turned
out
of
one
train
into
another
because
les
allemands
were
on
the
line
so
when
the
noise
awoke
me
i
knew
at
once
it
was
those
germans
that
i
had
been
running
away
from
all
day
long
between
ostend
and
bruges
and
bruges
and
ghent
and
ghent
and
boom
and
antwerp
i
lay
quite
still
they
come
at
last
i
thought
this
is
the
real
thing
vaguely
i
wondered
what
to
do
the
roar
of
cannon
was
enormous
and
it
seemed
to
be
just
outside
my
window
and
cracking
and
rapping
through
it
i
heard
the
quick
incessant
fire
of
musketry
crack
crack
crack
a
beautiful
clean
noise
like
millions
of
forest
boughs
sharply
breaking
in
strong
men
hands
vaguely
i
listened
and
vaguely
i
tried
to
imagine
how
the
germans
could
have
got
inside
antwerp
so
quickly
then
vaguely
i
got
out
of
bed
in
the
pitch
blackness
so
hot
and
stifling
i
stood
there
trying
to
think
but
my
room
seemed
full
of
the
roar
of
cannon
and
i
experienced
a
queer
sensation
as
though
i
was
losing
consciousness
in
the
sea
under
the
loud
beat
of
waves
i
must
turn
up
the
light
i
said
to
myself
or
they
will
see
where
i
am
that
the
thing
i
must
do
again
i
tried
to
think
what
to
do
and
then
suddenly
i
found
myself
listening
with
a
of
immense
and
utter
content
to
the
wild
outcry
of
those
cannons
and
muskets
and
i
felt
as
if
i
must
listen
and
listen
and
listen
till
i
knew
the
sounds
by
heart
as
for
fear
there
was
none
not
any
at
all
not
a
particle
instead
there
was
something
curiously
akin
to
rapture
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
supreme
satisfaction
of
having
at
last
dropped
clean
away
from
all
the
of
life
seized
upon
me
standing
there
in
my
nightgown
in
the
airless
room
at
antwerp
a
woman
quite
alone
among
strangers
with
danger
knocking
at
the
gate
of
her
world
all
life
up
to
this
minute
seemed
nothing
else
but
for
only
death
seemed
real
and
only
death
seemed
glorious
all
this
took
me
about
two
minutes
to
think
and
then
i
began
to
move
about
my
room
stupidly
vaguely
i
seemed
to
bump
up
against
the
noise
of
the
cannons
at
every
step
but
i
could
not
find
the
door
and
i
could
not
find
a
wrapper
my
hands
went
out
into
the
darkness
grabbing
reaching
but
all
the
while
i
was
listening
with
that
deep
undisturbed
content
to
the
terrific
fire
that
seemed
to
shake
the
earth
and
heaven
to
pieces
all
i
could
get
hold
of
was
the
sheet
and
blankets
i
had
arrived
back
at
my
bed
again
well
i
must
turn
away
i
must
look
elsewhere
and
then
i
quietly
and
unexpectedly
put
out
my
hand
and
turned
up
the
light
in
a
fit
of
desperate
defiance
of
the
german
brutes
outside
in
a
flash
i
saw
my
it
was
locked
i
saw
my
powder
puff
i
saw
my
bag
then
i
put
out
the
light
and
picked
up
my
got
to
my
bag
and
fumbled
for
the
keys
and
opened
my
and
dragged
out
a
wrapper
but
no
slippers
came
under
my
fingers
and
i
wanted
slippers
in
case
of
going
out
into
the
streets
but
by
this
time
i
had
discovered
that
nothing
matters
at
all
and
i
quietly
turned
up
the
light
again
being
by
then
a
confirmed
and
fatalist
standing
in
front
of
the
i
found
myself
slowly
powdering
my
face
then
the
sound
of
people
rushing
along
the
corridor
reached
me
and
i
opened
my
door
and
went
out
une
bataille
ce
sont
les
allemands
queried
a
poor
old
lady
mais
non
madame
shouts
a
dashing
big
aeronaut
running
by
ce
pas
une
bataille
le
zeppelin
and
so
it
was
the
zeppelin
had
come
for
the
second
time
to
antwerp
and
the
cannons
and
musketry
were
the
onslaughts
upon
the
monster
by
the
belgian
soldiers
mad
with
rage
at
the
impudent
visit
and
all
ready
with
a
hot
reception
for
it
down
the
stairs
i
fled
snatched
away
now
from
those
wonderful
moments
of
reality
alone
with
the
noise
of
the
cannons
in
the
of
that
stifling
bedroom
down
the
great
stairs
until
we
all
came
to
a
full
stop
in
the
hotel
lounge
below
one
dim
light
shaded
half
into
darkness
revealed
the
silhouettes
of
tall
motionless
green
palms
and
white
wicker
chairs
and
scarlet
carpets
and
little
tables
and
the
strangest
crowd
in
all
the
world
the
zeppelin
was
sailing
overhead
just
then
flinging
the
ghastliest
of
all
ghastly
deaths
from
her
cages
as
she
sped
along
her
craven
way
across
the
skies
but
that
crowd
in
the
foyer
of
the
great
antwerp
hotel
remained
absolutely
silent
absolutely
calm
there
was
a
tiny
boy
from
liège
whose
trembling
pink
feet
peeped
from
the
blankets
in
which
he
had
been
carried
down
there
was
a
lovely
heroic
liège
lady
whose
gaiety
and
sweetness
and
charming
toilettes
had
been
making
sunshine
in
a
shady
place
for
us
all
in
these
dark
days
everyone
remembered
afterwards
how
beautiful
the
little
liège
lady
looked
with
her
great
black
eyes
still
sparkling
and
long
hair
falling
over
her
shoulders
and
a
black
wrapper
flung
over
her
white
nightgown
and
her
husband
a
huge
belgian
giant
with
exquisite
manners
and
a
lisp
a
daring
aviator
never
seen
except
in
a
remarkable
pair
of
bright
yellow
bags
of
trousers
his
lisp
was
unaffected
and
his
blue
eyes
bright
and
blue
as
spring
flowers
and
his
heart
was
and
there
was
madame
la
patronne
wrapped
in
a
good
many
things
and
an
englishman
with
a
brown
moustache
who
must
have
had
an
automatic
toilette
as
he
is
here
fully
dressed
even
to
his
hat
boots
and
all
and
some
who
always
have
the
incontestable
air
of
having
arranged
the
war
from
beginning
to
end
especially
when
they
appear
like
this
in
their
pyjamas
and
a
crowd
of
belgian
ladies
and
children
and
all
the
maids
and
garçons
and
the
porters
and
the
and
various
strange
old
gentlemen
in
overcoats
and
bare
legs
and
strange
old
ladies
with
their
heads
tied
who
will
never
be
seen
again
not
to
be
recognised
and
the
cook
from
the
lowest
regions
and
the
chasseur
who
runs
messages
there
we
all
were
waiting
while
the
zeppelin
sailed
overhead
and
the
terrific
crash
and
boom
and
crack
and
deafening
detonations
grew
fainter
and
fainter
as
the
belgian
soldiers
fled
along
through
the
night
in
pursuit
of
the
german
dastard
that
was
finally
driven
back
to
cologne
having
dashed
many
houses
to
bits
then
the
little
chass
who
has
run
through
the
away
down
the
road
comes
racing
back
breathless
across
the
flagged
stone
courtyard
oh
mais
chic
le
zepp
he
cries
enthusiastically
his
young
black
eyes
afire
tout
à
fait
chic
vous
savez
and
if
that
not
truly
belge
i
really
do
know
what
is
illustration
an
order
from
the
belgian
war
office
chapter
iv
in
the
track
of
the
huns
when
i
look
back
on
those
days
the
most
pathetic
thing
about
it
all
seems
to
me
the
absolute
security
in
which
we
imagined
ourselves
dwelling
the
king
and
queen
were
in
their
palace
that
tall
simple
grey
house
in
the
middle
of
the
town
often
one
saw
the
king
seated
in
an
open
motor
car
coming
in
and
out
of
the
town
or
striding
quickly
into
the
palace
tall
and
fair
his
appearance
always
seemed
to
me
to
undergo
an
extraordinary
change
from
the
face
as
shewn
in
photographs
it
was
because
in
real
life
those
beautiful
wide
blue
eyes
of
his
mirrors
of
truth
and
simple
courage
were
covered
with
glasses
and
la
petite
reine
equally
beloved
was
very
often
to
be
seen
too
driving
backwards
and
forwards
to
the
hospitals
the
only
visits
she
ever
paid
all
theatres
were
closed
all
concerts
all
cinemas
all
the
galleries
were
shut
never
a
note
of
song
or
music
was
to
be
heard
anywhere
to
open
a
piano
at
one
hotel
would
have
been
a
crime
and
yet
that
immense
crowd
gathered
together
in
antwerp
for
safety
ambassadors
ministers
and
their
wives
and
families
consuls
échevins
merchants
stockbrokers
peasants
were
anything
but
gloomy
a
peculiar
tide
of
life
flowed
in
and
out
through
that
vast
cityful
of
people
it
was
life
vibrant
with
expectation
thrilling
with
hope
and
fear
without
a
moment
loneliness
they
walked
about
the
shady
avenues
they
sat
at
their
cafés
they
talked
they
sipped
their
coffee
or
their
elixir
and
then
they
went
home
to
bed
after
seven
the
streets
were
empty
the
cafés
shut
the
day
life
ended
never
a
doubt
crossed
our
minds
that
the
germans
could
possibly
get
through
those
endless
fortifications
surrounding
antwerp
on
all
sides
getting
about
was
incredibly
difficult
in
fact
without
a
car
one
could
see
nothing
and
there
were
no
cars
to
be
had
the
war
office
had
taken
them
all
over
in
despair
i
went
to
sir
frederick
greville
the
english
ambassador
and
after
certain
formalities
and
inquiries
sir
frederick
very
kindly
went
himself
to
the
war
office
saw
count
chabeau
on
my
behalf
and
arranged
for
my
getting
a
car
many
a
dewy
morning
while
the
sun
was
low
in
the
east
i
have
started
out
and
driven
along
the
road
to
ghent
or
to
liège
or
to
malines
and
looking
from
the
car
i
observed
those
endless
forests
of
wire
and
the
mined
waters
whose
bridges
one
drove
over
so
slowly
so
softly
in
such
fear
and
trembling
and
then
set
deep
in
the
great
fortified
hillsides
the
mouths
of
innumerable
cannon
pointed
at
one
and
here
and
there
great
reflectors
were
placed
against
the
dull
to
shew
when
the
enemy
aircraft
appeared
in
the
skies
nothing
seemed
wanting
to
make
those
fortifications
complete
and
successful
it
was
to
see
the
magnificent
old
châteaux
and
the
beautiful
little
houses
being
ruthlessly
cut
down
razed
to
the
earth
to
make
clear
ground
in
all
directions
for
the
the
stumps
of
the
trees
used
to
look
to
me
like
the
ruins
of
some
ancient
city
for
even
they
represented
the
avenues
of
real
streets
and
roads
and
the
black
empty
places
behind
them
were
the
homes
that
had
been
demolished
in
this
overwhelming
attempt
to
keep
at
least
one
city
of
belgium
safe
and
secure
from
the
marauding
huns
afterwards
when
all
was
over
when
antwerp
had
fallen
i
passed
through
the
fortifications
for
the
last
time
on
my
way
to
holland
and
oh
the
sadness
of
it
there
were
the
wire
entanglements
untouched
unaltered
the
great
reflectors
still
mirrored
the
sunlight
and
the
stars
the
demolition
of
the
châteaux
and
house
had
been
all
in
vain
on
this
side
there
had
been
little
fighting
they
had
got
in
on
the
other
side
every
five
minutes
one
car
would
be
held
up
by
sentinels
who
rushed
forward
with
poised
bayonets
demanding
the
password
for
the
day
that
always
seemed
to
me
like
a
bit
of
mediæval
history
arrêtez
cried
the
sentinels
on
either
side
the
road
lifting
their
rifles
as
they
spoke
of
course
we
came
to
a
stop
immediately
then
the
chauffeur
would
lean
far
out
and
whisper
in
a
hoarse
low
voice
the
password
which
varied
with
an
incessant
variety
sometimes
it
would
be
ostend
or
termond
or
demain
or
general
or
bruxelles
or
belgique
or
whatever
the
war
office
chose
to
make
it
then
the
sentinel
would
nod
good
he
would
say
and
on
we
would
go
the
motor
car
lent
me
by
the
belgian
war
office
was
driven
by
an
excitable
old
belgian
who
loved
nothing
better
than
to
get
into
a
dangerous
spot
his
favourite
saying
when
we
got
near
and
one
asked
him
if
he
were
frightened
was
one
can
only
die
once
and
the
louder
the
shells
the
quicker
he
drove
towards
them
and
i
used
to
love
the
way
his
old
eyes
flashed
and
i
loved
too
the
keenly
disappointed
look
that
crept
over
his
face
when
the
sentinels
refused
to
let
him
go
any
nearer
the
danger
line
and
we
had
to
creep
ignominiously
back
to
safety
does
not
your
master
ever
go
towards
the
fighting
i
asked
him
non
madame
he
answered
sadly
mon
general
he
is
the
papa
of
the
commissariat
he
does
not
go
near
the
fighting
he
only
looks
after
the
eating
we
left
antwerp
one
morning
about
nine
and
sped
outwards
through
the
fortifications
being
stopped
every
ten
minutes
as
usual
by
the
sentinels
and
asked
to
show
our
papers
on
we
ran
along
the
white
roads
through
exquisite
green
country
the
roads
were
crowded
constantly
with
soldiers
coming
and
going
and
in
all
the
villages
we
found
the
headquarters
of
one
or
other
division
of
the
belgian
army
making
life
and
bustle
indescribable
in
the
flagged
old
streets
and
around
the
steps
of
the
quaint
mediæval
town
halls
and
cathedrals
illustration
a
friendly
chat
we
had
gone
a
long
way
when
we
were
brought
to
a
standstill
at
a
little
place
called
den
berg
where
the
sentinels
leaned
into
our
car
and
had
a
long
friendly
chat
with
us
you
can
not
go
any
further
they
said
the
germans
are
in
the
next
town
ahead
they
are
only
a
few
kilometres
away
what
town
is
it
i
asked
aerschot
they
replied
that
is
on
the
way
to
louvain
is
it
not
i
asked
i
have
been
trying
for
a
long
time
to
get
to
louvain
you
can
never
get
to
louvain
madam
the
sentinels
told
me
smilingly
between
here
and
louvain
lies
the
bulk
of
the
german
army
just
then
a
mounted
on
a
beautiful
fiery
little
brown
ardennes
horse
came
galloping
along
shouting
as
he
passed
the
germans
have
been
turned
out
of
aerschot
we
have
driven
them
out
sales
cochons
he
jumped
off
his
horse
gave
the
reins
to
a
soldier
and
leapt
into
a
train
that
was
standing
at
the
station
a
sudden
inspiration
flashed
into
my
head
without
a
word
i
jumped
out
of
the
motor
car
ran
through
the
station
and
got
into
that
train
just
as
it
was
moving
off
leaving
my
old
belgian
to
look
after
the
car
next
moment
i
found
myself
being
carried
along
through
unknown
regions
and
as
i
looked
from
the
windows
i
soon
discovered
that
i
had
entered
now
into
the
very
heart
of
german
ruin
and
pillage
and
destructiveness
pangs
of
horror
attacked
me
at
the
sight
of
those
blackened
roofless
houses
standing
lonely
and
deserted
among
green
thriving
fields
i
saw
one
little
farm
after
another
reduced
to
a
heap
of
blackened
ashes
with
some
lonely
animals
gazing
terrifiedly
into
space
sometimes
just
one
wall
would
be
standing
of
what
was
once
a
home
sometimes
only
the
front
of
the
house
had
been
blown
out
by
shells
and
you
could
see
right
inside
see
the
rooms
spread
out
before
you
like
a
panorama
see
the
children
toys
and
frocks
lying
about
and
the
pots
and
pans
even
the
remains
of
dinner
still
on
the
table
and
all
the
homely
little
things
that
made
you
feel
so
intensely
the
difference
between
this
chill
deathly
desolation
and
the
happy
domestic
life
that
had
gone
on
in
such
peaceful
streams
before
the
huns
set
their
faces
mile
after
mile
the
train
passed
through
these
ravaged
areas
and
i
stood
at
the
window
with
misty
eyes
and
quickened
breath
looking
up
and
down
the
lonely
roads
and
over
the
deserted
fields
where
never
a
soul
was
to
be
seen
and
in
my
mind
eye
i
could
follow
those
peasants
fleeing
fleeing
ever
fleeing
from
one
village
to
another
from
one
town
to
another
hunted
and
followed
by
the
cruel
menace
of
war
which
they
poor
innocent
ones
had
done
so
little
to
deserve
the
only
comfort
was
to
think
of
them
getting
safely
across
to
england
and
as
i
looked
at
those
little
black
and
ruined
homes
i
could
follow
the
refugees
in
their
flight
and
see
them
streaming
out
of
the
trains
at
victoria
and
charing
cross
and
being
taken
to
warm
comfortable
homes
and
clothed
and
fed
by
english
people
and
then
waking
perhaps
in
the
depths
of
the
night
to
find
themselves
in
a
strange
land
how
their
thoughts
would
fly
with
what
awful
yearning
back
to
those
little
blackened
homes
back
to
the
memories
of
the
cow
and
the
horse
and
the
faithful
dogs
and
the
corn
in
the
meadows
and
the
purple
cabbages
uncut
and
the
apples
ungarnered
yes
i
could
see
it
all
and
my
heart
ached
as
it
had
never
ached
before
when
i
roused
myself
from
these
sad
thoughts
i
looked
about
me
and
discovered
that
i
was
in
a
train
full
of
nothing
but
soldiers
and
priests
i
sat
very
still
in
my
corner
i
asked
no
questions
and
spoke
to
no
one
i
knew
by
instinct
that
this
train
was
going
to
take
me
to
a
place
that
i
never
should
have
arrived
at
otherwise
and
i
was
right
the
train
took
me
to
aerschot
and
i
may
say
now
that
only
one
other
arrived
there
alighting
at
the
station
at
aerschot
i
looked
about
me
scarcely
believing
that
what
i
saw
was
real
the
railway
station
appeared
to
have
fallen
victim
to
an
earthquake
chapter
v
aerschot
i
think
until
that
day
i
had
always
cherished
a
lurking
hope
that
the
huns
were
not
as
black
as
they
were
painted
i
had
been
used
to
think
of
the
german
race
as
tinged
with
a
certain
golden
glamour
because
to
it
belonged
the
man
who
wrote
the
fifth
symphony
the
man
who
wrote
the
divine
first
part
of
faust
and
still
more
that
other
whose
mocking
but
sublime
laughter
would
be
a
fitting
accompaniment
of
the
horrors
at
aerschot
oh
beethoven
goethe
heine
not
even
out
of
respect
for
your
undying
genius
can
i
hide
the
truth
about
the
germans
any
longer
what
i
have
seen
i
must
believe
in
the
pouring
rain
wearing
a
belgian
officer
i
trudged
along
through
a
city
that
might
well
have
been
pompeii
or
herculaneum
it
was
a
city
that
existed
no
longer
it
was
absolutely
shell
of
a
the
long
streets
were
full
of
hollow
blackened
skeletons
of
what
had
once
been
houses
street
upon
street
of
them
and
street
upon
street
the
brain
reeled
before
the
spectacle
and
each
of
those
houses
once
a
home
a
place
of
thought
of
rest
of
happiness
of
work
of
love
all
the
inhabitants
have
fled
leaving
their
lares
and
penates
just
as
the
people
of
pompeii
and
herculaneum
sought
to
flee
when
the
lava
came
down
on
them
here
a
wall
stands
there
a
pillar
and
a
few
bricks
but
between
the
ruins
strange
touching
unbelievable
gleaming
from
the
background
are
the
scarlet
and
white
of
dahlias
and
roses
in
the
gardens
behind
that
have
somehow
miraculously
escaped
the
ruin
that
has
fallen
on
the
solid
walls
and
ceilings
and
floors
so
carefully
constructed
by
the
brain
of
man
and
so
easily
ruined
by
brutality
it
is
as
though
the
flowers
had
some
miraculous
power
of
some
secret
unknown
to
bricks
and
mortar
some
strange
magic
that
keeps
the
sweet
blossoms
laughing
and
defiant
under
the
hun
and
the
red
and
the
pure
white
of
them
and
the
green
intensify
with
a
tremendous
potency
the
black
horrors
of
the
town
in
every
street
i
observed
always
the
same
thing
hundreds
of
empty
bottles
toujours
one
of
my
companions
kept
saying
a
brilliant
young
brussels
lawyer
who
was
now
in
this
regiment
the
other
officer
was
also
a
and
i
was
told
afterwards
that
these
two
had
formerly
been
the
nuts
of
brussels
the
two
smartest
young
men
of
the
town
to
see
them
that
day
gave
little
idea
of
their
smartness
they
both
were
black
with
grime
and
smoke
with
beards
that
had
no
right
to
be
there
creeping
over
their
faces
boots
caked
with
mud
to
the
knees
and
a
general
air
of
having
seen
activities
at
very
close
quarters
they
took
me
to
the
church
and
there
the
little
old
sacristan
joined
us
punctuating
our
way
with
groans
and
sobs
of
horror
this
is
what
i
see
before
me
stretches
a
great
dim
interior
lit
with
little
bunches
of
yellow
candles
it
is
in
a
way
a
church
but
what
has
happened
to
it
what
horror
has
seized
upon
it
turning
it
into
the
most
hideous
travesty
of
a
church
that
the
world
has
ever
known
on
the
high
altar
stand
empty
champagne
bottles
empty
rum
bottles
a
broken
bottle
of
bordeaux
and
five
bottles
of
beer
in
the
confessionals
stand
empty
champagne
bottles
empty
brandy
bottles
empty
beer
bottles
in
the
holy
water
fonts
are
empty
brandy
bottles
stacks
of
bottles
are
under
the
pews
or
on
the
seats
themselves
beer
brandy
rum
champagne
bordeaux
burgundy
and
again
beer
brandy
rum
champagne
bordeaux
burgundy
everywhere
everywhere
in
whatever
part
of
the
church
one
looks
there
are
bottles
hundreds
of
them
thousands
of
them
perhaps
everywhere
bottles
bottles
bottles
the
sacred
marble
floors
are
covered
everywhere
with
piles
of
straw
and
bottles
and
heaps
of
refuse
and
filth
and
mais
madame
cries
the
burning
trembling
voice
of
the
distracted
sacristan
look
at
this
and
he
leads
me
to
the
white
marble
of
the
madonna
the
madonna
head
has
been
cut
right
off
then
even
as
i
stand
there
trying
to
believe
that
i
am
really
looking
at
such
nightmares
i
feel
the
little
sacristan
fingers
trembling
on
my
arm
turning
me
towards
a
sight
that
makes
me
cold
with
horror
they
have
set
fire
to
the
christ
to
the
beautiful
of
our
saviour
and
burnt
the
sacred
figure
all
up
one
side
and
on
the
face
and
breast
and
as
they
finished
the
work
i
can
imagine
them
with
a
hiccup
slitting
up
the
priceless
brocade
on
the
altar
with
a
bayonet
then
turning
and
slashing
at
the
great
old
oil
paintings
on
the
cathedral
walls
chopping
them
right
out
of
their
frames
but
leaving
the
empty
frames
there
with
a
german
sense
of
humour
that
will
presently
make
germany
laugh
on
the
wrong
side
of
its
face
a
dead
pig
lies
in
the
little
chapel
to
the
right
a
dead
white
pig
with
a
pink
snout
very
still
and
pathetic
is
that
dead
pig
and
yet
it
seems
to
speak
it
seems
to
realise
the
sacrilege
of
its
presence
here
in
god
house
it
seems
to
say
let
not
the
name
of
pig
be
given
to
the
germans
we
pigs
have
done
nothing
to
deserve
it
and
here
madame
voyez
vous
here
the
floor
is
chipped
and
smashed
where
they
stabled
their
horses
these
barbarians
says
the
young
lieutenant
on
my
left
and
now
we
come
to
the
gate
of
shame
it
is
the
door
of
a
small
still
pinned
outside
on
the
door
is
a
piece
of
white
paper
with
this
message
in
german
this
room
is
private
keep
away
and
inside
inside
are
women
garments
a
pile
of
them
tossed
hastily
on
the
floor
torn
perhaps
from
the
wearers
a
pile
of
women
garments
in
silence
we
stand
there
in
silence
we
go
out
it
is
a
long
time
before
anyone
can
speak
again
though
the
little
sacristan
keeps
on
moaning
to
himself
as
we
step
out
of
the
horrors
of
that
church
some
german
prisoners
that
have
just
been
brought
in
are
being
marched
by
and
then
rage
overcomes
one
of
the
young
lieutenants
white
trembling
beside
himself
he
rushes
forward
he
shouts
he
raves
he
is
thinking
of
that
room
they
were
of
belgium
those
girls
and
women
he
is
of
belgium
too
and
he
flings
his
scorn
and
hatred
at
the
uhlans
marching
past
he
lashes
and
whips
them
with
his
agony
of
rage
until
the
cowering
prisoners
are
out
of
hearing
the
other
lieutenant
at
last
succeeds
in
silencing
him
what
is
the
use
mon
ami
he
says
what
is
the
use
perhaps
this
outburst
is
reported
to
headquarters
by
somebody
for
that
night
at
the
officers
mess
the
captain
of
the
regiment
has
a
few
words
to
say
against
shewing
anger
towards
prisoners
and
very
gently
and
tactfully
he
says
them
he
is
a
belgian
and
all
belgians
are
careful
to
a
point
that
is
almost
beyond
human
comprehension
in
their
criticisms
of
their
enemies
let
us
be
careful
never
to
demean
ourselves
by
humiliating
prisoners
says
the
captain
looking
round
the
long
table
you
see
my
friends
these
poor
german
fellows
that
we
take
are
not
all
typical
of
the
crimes
that
the
germans
commit
lots
of
them
are
only
peasants
or
men
that
would
prefer
to
stay
by
their
own
fireside
what
about
aerschot
and
the
church
cry
a
score
of
irritated
young
voices
the
captain
draws
his
kindly
lips
together
and
attacks
his
black
bread
and
tinned
mackerel
ah
he
says
we
must
remember
they
were
all
drunk
and
as
he
utters
these
words
there
flash
across
my
mind
those
old
old
words
that
will
never
die
forgive
them
for
they
know
not
what
they
do
chapter
vi
the
swift
retribution
as
i
stood
in
the
rain
down
there
in
the
ruined
blackened
piazza
of
aerschot
someone
drew
my
attention
to
the
hole
in
the
of
the
burgomaster
house
in
cold
blood
the
germans
had
shot
the
burgomaster
and
they
had
shot
two
of
his
children
and
as
they
could
not
find
the
burgomaster
wife
who
had
fled
into
the
country
they
had
offered
francs
reward
for
her
a
hoarse
voice
whispered
that
in
that
room
with
the
broken
window
the
german
colonel
who
had
ordered
the
murder
of
the
good
kind
beloved
burgomaster
had
met
his
own
fate
yes
in
the
room
of
the
dead
burgomaster
maidservant
the
german
colonel
had
fallen
dead
from
a
shot
fired
from
without
by
whose
hand
was
it
fired
that
shot
that
laid
the
monster
at
his
victim
feet
by
the
hand
of
an
inferieur
someone
whispers
and
i
put
together
the
story
and
understand
that
the
girl
village
sweetheart
avenged
her
they
are
both
dead
now
the
girl
and
her
village
swain
shot
down
instantly
by
the
howling
germans
but
their
memory
will
never
die
for
they
stand
that
martyred
boy
and
girl
for
belgium
fight
for
its
women
honour
and
the
manliness
of
its
men
chapter
vii
they
would
not
kill
the
cook
besides
myself
i
discover
only
one
woman
in
the
whole
of
aerschot
a
little
fleming
with
a
lion
heart
she
is
the
bravest
woman
in
the
world
i
love
the
delightful
way
she
drops
her
wee
baby
into
my
arms
and
goes
off
to
serve
a
hundred
hungry
belgians
with
black
bread
and
coffee
confident
that
her
little
treasure
will
be
quite
safe
in
the
lap
of
the
anglaise
smiling
and
running
about
between
the
kitchen
the
officers
mess
and
the
bar
this
brave
good
soul
finds
time
to
tell
us
how
she
remained
all
alone
in
aerschot
for
three
whole
weeks
all
the
while
the
germans
were
in
possession
of
the
town
i
knew
that
cooking
they
must
have
she
says
and
food
and
drink
and
for
that
i
knew
i
was
safe
so
i
remained
here
and
kept
the
hotel
of
my
little
husband
from
being
burned
to
the
ground
but
i
slept
always
with
my
baby
in
my
arms
and
the
revolver
beside
the
pillow
in
the
night
sometimes
i
heard
them
knocking
at
my
door
yes
they
would
knock
knock
knock
and
i
would
lie
there
the
revolver
ready
if
needs
be
for
myself
and
the
petite
both
but
they
never
forced
that
door
they
would
go
away
as
stealthily
as
they
had
come
ah
they
knew
that
if
they
had
got
in
they
would
have
found
a
dead
woman
not
a
live
one
and
i
quite
believed
her
chapter
viii
you
never
get
there
as
the
weeks
went
on
a
strange
thing
happened
to
me
at
first
vaguely
faintly
and
then
with
an
intensity
there
sprang
to
life
within
me
a
sense
of
irritation
at
having
to
depend
on
newspapers
or
hearsay
for
one
knowledge
of
the
chief
item
in
this
war
the
enemy
an
overwhelming
desire
seized
upon
me
to
discover
for
myself
what
a
certain
darksome
unknown
quantity
was
like
that
darksome
unknown
quantity
that
we
were
always
hearing
about
but
never
saw
that
we
were
always
moving
away
from
if
we
heard
it
was
anywhere
near
that
was
making
all
the
difference
to
everything
that
was
at
the
back
of
everything
that
mattered
so
tremendously
and
yet
could
never
be
visualized
the
habit
of
a
lifetime
of
groping
for
realities
began
to
assert
itself
and
i
found
myself
chafing
at
not
being
able
to
find
things
out
for
myself
in
the
descriptions
i
gleaned
from
men
and
newspapers
i
was
gradually
discovering
many
puzzling
incongruities
there
are
thinkers
whose
conclusions
one
honours
and
attends
to
but
these
thinkers
were
not
out
here
looking
at
the
war
with
their
own
eyes
maeterlinck
for
instance
whose
deductions
would
have
been
invaluable
was
in
france
tolstoi
was
dead
wells
was
in
england
writing
to
believe
what
people
tell
you
you
must
first
believe
in
the
people
if
you
can
find
one
person
to
believe
in
in
a
lifetime
and
that
one
person
is
yourself
you
are
lucky
one
day
towards
the
end
of
september
i
heard
an
old
professor
from
liège
university
talking
to
a
young
bruxellois
with
a
black
moustache
and
piercing
black
eyes
who
had
arrived
that
day
at
our
hotel
so
you
are
going
back
at
once
to
brussels
monsieur
said
the
old
professor
in
his
shaky
voice
yes
monsieur
why
do
you
come
with
me
i
have
not
the
courage
courage
but
there
is
nothing
to
fear
you
come
along
with
me
and
see
you
through
all
right
i
assure
you
the
trains
run
right
into
brussels
now
the
germans
leave
us
bruxellois
alone
they
trying
to
win
our
favour
they
never
interfere
with
us
there
is
not
the
slightest
danger
and
there
is
not
half
so
much
trouble
and
difficulty
to
get
in
and
out
of
brussels
as
there
is
to
get
in
and
out
antwerp
you
get
into
a
train
at
ghent
go
to
grammont
and
there
change
into
a
little
train
that
takes
you
straight
to
brussels
they
never
ask
us
for
our
passports
now
for
myself
i
have
come
backwards
and
forwards
from
brussels
half
a
dozen
times
this
last
fortnight
on
special
missions
for
our
government
i
have
never
been
stopped
once
if
you
trust
yourself
to
me
i
see
you
safely
through
i
desire
to
go
very
much
muttered
the
old
man
there
are
things
in
liège
that
i
must
attend
to
but
to
get
to
liège
i
must
go
through
brussels
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
great
risk
a
very
great
risk
no
risk
at
all
said
the
young
bruxellois
cheerfully
that
evening
at
dinner
the
young
man
aforesaid
was
introduced
to
me
by
frank
fox
of
the
who
knew
him
well
it
was
not
long
before
i
said
to
him
do
you
think
it
would
be
possible
for
an
englishwoman
to
get
into
brussels
i
should
like
very
much
to
go
i
want
to
get
an
interview
with
max
for
my
newspaper
he
was
an
extremely
optimistic
and
cheerful
young
man
he
said
quite
easy
i
know
max
very
well
if
you
come
with
me
see
you
safely
through
and
take
you
to
see
him
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
got
a
little
party
travelling
with
me
on
friday
and
i
shall
be
delighted
if
you
will
join
us
i
come
i
said
extraordinary
how
easy
it
is
to
make
up
one
mind
about
big
things
that
decision
which
was
the
most
important
one
i
ever
made
in
my
life
gave
me
less
trouble
than
i
have
sometimes
been
caused
by
such
trifles
as
how
to
do
one
hair
or
what
frock
to
wear
next
day
i
told
everyone
i
was
going
to
try
to
get
into
brussels
you
be
taken
prisoner
you
mad
you
be
shot
you
will
be
taken
for
a
spy
you
will
never
get
there
all
these
things
and
hosts
of
others
were
said
but
perhaps
the
most
potent
of
all
the
arguments
was
that
put
up
by
the
sweet
little
lady
from
liège
the
mother
with
two
adorable
little
boys
and
a
delightful
big
husband
the
gallant
chevalier
in
yellow
bags
of
trousers
whom
i
have
already
referred
to
in
an
earlier
chapter
this
little
liègeoise
and
i
were
now
great
friends
i
shall
speak
of
her
as
alice
she
had
a
gaiety
and
insouciance
and
a
natural
childlike
merriment
that
all
her
terrible
disasters
could
not
overcloud
what
laughs
we
used
to
have
together
she
and
i
what
talks
what
walks
and
sometimes
the
big
husband
would
give
alice
a
delightful
little
dinner
at
the
criterium
restaurant
in
the
avenue
de
kaiser
where
we
ate
such
delicious
things
it
was
impossible
to
believe
oneself
in
a
belgian
city
with
war
going
on
at
the
gates
when
i
told
alice
that
i
was
going
to
brussels
she
set
to
work
with
all
her
womanly
powers
of
persuasion
to
make
me
give
up
my
project
there
was
nothing
she
did
not
urge
the
worst
of
all
was
that
we
might
never
see
each
other
again
but
i
do
feel
like
that
i
told
her
i
feel
that
i
must
go
it
a
funny
feeling
i
ca
describe
it
because
it
is
exactly
real
i
do
feel
exactly
that
i
must
go
even
when
i
am
telling
you
that
it
is
exactly
true
i
am
afraid
this
is
too
complicated
for
me
said
alice
gravely
i
admit
it
sounds
complicated
i
suppose
what
it
really
mean
is
that
i
want
to
go
and
i
am
going
but
my
husband
says
we
may
be
in
brussels
ourselves
in
three
time
why
not
wait
and
come
in
in
safety
with
the
belgian
army
other
people
gathered
round
us
there
in
the
palm
court
of
the
big
antwerp
hotel
and
a
lively
discussion
went
on
a
big
dark
man
with
a
melancholy
face
said
wistfully
i
wish
i
could
make
up
my
mind
to
go
too
this
was
cherry
kearton
the
famous
naturalist
and
photographer
he
was
out
at
the
front
looking
for
pictures
and
in
his
mind
eye
doubtless
he
saw
the
pictures
he
would
get
in
brussels
pictures
sneakingly
and
stealthily
taken
from
windows
at
the
risk
of
one
life
glorious
pictures
pictures
a
photographer
would
naturally
see
in
his
mind
eye
when
he
thought
of
getting
into
brussels
during
the
german
occupation
kearton
interpreter
a
little
man
however
put
in
a
couple
of
sharp
words
that
were
intended
to
act
as
an
antidote
to
the
great
photographer
uncertain
longings
you
be
shot
for
a
dead
certainty
cherry
he
said
you
get
into
brussels
with
your
photographic
apparatus
why
you
might
as
well
walk
straight
out
to
the
germans
and
ask
them
to
finish
you
off
cherry
had
his
old
enemy
malaria
hanging
about
him
at
that
time
or
i
quite
believe
he
would
have
risked
it
and
come
but
as
events
turned
out
it
was
lucky
for
him
he
did
for
his
king
and
his
country
have
called
him
since
then
in
a
voice
he
could
not
resist
and
he
has
gone
to
his
beloved
africa
again
in
colonel
driscoll
league
of
frontiersmen
when
i
met
him
out
there
in
antwerp
he
had
just
returned
from
his
famous
journey
across
central
africa
his
thoughts
were
all
of
lions
giraffes
monkeys
rhinoceros
he
would
talk
on
and
on
quite
carried
away
he
made
noises
like
baboons
boars
lions
monkeys
he
was
great
fun
i
was
always
listening
to
him
and
gradually
i
would
forget
the
war
forget
i
was
in
antwerp
and
be
carried
right
away
into
the
jungle
watching
a
crowd
of
giraffes
coming
down
to
drink
indeed
the
vividness
of
cherry
stories
was
such
that
when
i
think
of
antwerp
now
i
hear
the
roar
of
lions
the
pad
pad
of
wild
beasts
the
gutteral
uncouthness
of
monkeys
all
the
sounds
in
fact
that
so
excellently
represent
antwerp
present
occupiers
but
the
faces
of
cherry
wild
beasts
were
kinder
humaner
faces
than
the
faces
that
haunt
antwerp
now
chapter
ix
setting
out
on
the
great
adventure
it
was
on
friday
afternoon
september
that
i
ran
down
the
stairs
of
the
hotel
terminus
with
a
little
brown
bag
in
my
hand
without
saying
to
anybody
i
hurried
out
and
jumped
into
a
cab
at
the
door
accompanied
by
the
old
professor
from
liège
and
the
young
brussels
lawyer
it
was
a
gorgeous
day
about
four
in
the
afternoon
with
brilliant
sunlight
flooding
the
city
and
a
feeling
of
intense
elation
came
over
me
as
our
cab
went
rattling
along
over
the
old
flagged
streets
overhead
in
the
bright
blue
sky
aeroplanes
were
scouting
the
wind
blew
sweet
from
the
scheldt
and
the
flat
green
lands
beyond
all
the
banners
stirred
and
waved
french
english
belgian
and
russian
and
i
felt
contented
and
glad
i
had
started
first
we
call
for
madame
julie
said
the
young
lawyer
we
drove
along
the
quay
and
stopped
at
a
big
white
house
to
my
surprise
i
found
myself
now
suddenly
precipitated
into
the
midst
of
a
huge
belgian
party
mamma
papa
aunts
uncles
nephews
nieces
friends
officers
little
girls
little
boys
servants
gathered
in
a
great
and
crowded
to
the
full
i
was
introduced
to
everybody
and
a
lot
of
went
on
i
thought
to
myself
this
is
a
new
way
to
get
to
brussels
servants
were
going
round
with
trays
laden
with
glasses
of
foaming
champagne
and
little
sweet
biscuits
we
shall
drink
to
the
health
of
julie
said
someone
and
we
drank
to
julie
the
sun
poured
in
through
the
windows
and
the
genial
affectionate
belgian
family
all
gathered
closer
round
the
beloved
daughter
who
was
going
bravely
back
to
brussels
to
join
her
husband
there
at
his
post
it
was
a
touching
scene
but
as
i
think
of
it
now
it
becomes
poignant
with
the
tragedy
hidden
beneath
the
glittering
sunlight
and
foaming
champagne
that
fine
old
man
with
the
dignified
grey
head
and
beard
was
a
distinguished
belgian
minister
who
has
since
met
with
a
sad
death
he
was
julie
father
a
father
any
woman
might
have
been
proud
of
he
said
to
me
je
suis
content
that
a
lady
is
going
too
in
this
little
company
it
is
hard
for
my
daughter
to
be
travelling
about
alone
yet
she
is
brave
she
does
not
lack
courage
she
came
alone
all
the
way
from
brussels
three
days
ago
in
order
to
bring
her
little
girl
to
antwerp
and
leave
her
in
our
care
and
now
she
feels
it
is
her
duty
to
go
back
to
her
husband
in
brussels
though
we
of
course
long
to
have
her
remain
with
us
then
at
last
the
parting
came
and
tall
buxom
julie
kissed
and
was
kissed
by
everybody
and
everybody
shook
hands
with
me
and
wished
me
luck
and
i
felt
as
if
i
was
one
with
them
although
i
had
never
seen
them
in
my
life
before
and
never
saw
them
in
my
life
again
we
ran
down
the
steps
and
now
instead
of
getting
into
the
old
ricketty
fiacre
we
entered
a
handsome
motor
car
belonging
to
the
belgian
ministry
and
drove
quickly
to
the
quay
the
father
came
with
us
his
daughter
clinging
to
his
arm
at
the
quay
we
went
on
board
the
big
river
steamer
and
julie
bade
her
father
farewell
she
flung
herself
into
his
arms
and
he
clasped
her
tight
he
held
her
in
silence
for
a
long
minute
then
they
parted
they
never
met
again
as
we
moved
away
from
the
quay
it
seemed
to
me
that
our
steamer
was
steering
straight
for
the
hesperides
all
the
west
was
one
great
blazing
field
of
red
and
gold
and
the
sun
was
low
on
the
broad
water
edge
while
behind
us
the
fair
city
of
antwerp
lit
sparkling
lights
in
all
her
windows
and
the
old
cathedral
rose
high
into
the
sunlight
with
the
belgian
banner
fluttering
from
a
pinnacle
and
that
is
how
i
shall
always
see
antwerp
fair
and
stately
and
as
she
was
that
golden
september
afternoon
when
i
think
of
her
i
refuse
to
see
her
any
other
way
i
refuse
to
see
her
as
she
was
when
i
came
back
to
her
or
as
when
i
left
her
again
for
the
last
time
chapter
x
from
ghent
to
grammont
i
do
know
why
we
were
all
in
such
high
spirits
for
we
had
nothing
but
discomfort
to
endure
and
yet
out
of
that
very
discomfort
itself
some
peculiar
psychic
force
seemed
to
spring
to
life
and
thrive
until
we
became
as
merry
as
crickets
a
more
inherently
melancholy
type
than
the
old
liège
professor
could
scarcely
be
imagined
poor
old
soul
he
had
lost
his
wife
a
week
before
the
war
and
in
the
siege
of
liège
one
of
his
sons
had
fallen
and
he
had
lost
his
home
and
everything
he
held
dear
he
was
an
enormous
man
dressed
in
deep
black
the
most
pronounced
mourning
you
can
possibly
imagine
with
a
great
black
coming
well
down
on
his
huge
face
his
big
frame
quivered
like
a
jelly
as
he
sat
in
the
corner
of
the
train
and
was
shaken
by
the
rough
movements
and
the
frequent
stoppages
yet
he
became
cheerful
just
as
cheerful
as
any
of
us
strange
as
it
seems
in
the
telling
this
cheerfulness
is
a
normal
condition
of
the
people
nearest
the
front
there
is
only
one
thing
that
kills
it
loss
of
freedom
when
loss
of
freedom
means
loss
of
companionship
ruin
danger
cold
hunger
heat
dirt
discomfort
wounds
suffering
death
are
all
dashed
with
glory
and
become
acceptable
as
part
of
the
greatest
adventure
in
the
world
but
loss
of
freedom
wrings
the
colour
from
the
brain
and
shuts
out
this
world
and
the
next
when
it
entails
loss
of
comradeship
when
i
first
realised
this
strange
phenomenon
i
thought
it
would
take
a
volume
of
psychology
to
explain
it
and
then
all
suddenly
with
no
effort
of
thought
i
found
the
explanation
revealing
itself
in
one
magic
blessed
word
out
here
in
the
the
irksome
isolation
of
ordinary
lives
has
vanished
we
are
no
longer
alone
there
are
no
such
things
as
strangers
we
are
all
together
wherever
we
are
in
the
trenches
on
the
roads
in
the
trams
in
the
cities
in
the
villages
we
all
talk
to
each
other
we
all
know
each
other
histories
we
pour
out
our
hopes
and
fears
we
receive
the
warm
sweet
stimulus
of
human
comradeship
multiplied
out
of
all
proportion
to
anything
that
life
has
ever
offered
any
single
one
of
us
before
till
even
pain
and
death
take
on
more
gentle
semblance
seen
with
the
eyes
of
a
million
people
all
holding
hands
young
men
who
have
not
gone
go
now
find
out
for
yourselves
whether
this
wonderful
thing
that
i
tell
you
is
not
true
that
the
apart
from
its
terrific
and
glorious
qualities
holds
also
that
secret
of
gaiety
of
heart
that
mankind
is
ever
searching
for
we
were
at
nicolla
now
and
it
was
nearly
dark
and
our
train
was
at
a
standstill
i
get
out
and
see
what
the
matter
said
the
young
lawyer
whom
i
shall
refer
to
hereafter
as
jean
he
came
back
in
a
minute
looking
serious
the
train
does
go
any
further
he
said
there
no
train
for
ghent
we
all
got
out
clutching
our
bags
and
stood
there
on
the
platform
in
the
reddened
dusk
that
was
fast
passing
into
night
a
pontonnier
who
had
been
in
the
train
with
us
came
up
and
said
he
was
expecting
an
automobile
to
meet
him
here
and
perhaps
he
could
give
some
of
us
a
lift
as
far
as
ghent
however
his
automobile
did
turn
up
and
that
little
plan
fell
through
jean
began
to
bite
his
moustache
and
walk
up
and
down
smiling
intermittently
a
queer
smile
that
showed
his
white
teeth
he
always
did
that
when
he
was
thinking
how
to
circumvent
the
authorities
he
had
a
word
here
with
an
officer
and
a
word
there
with
a
gendarme
then
he
came
back
to
us
we
shall
all
go
and
interview
the
stationmaster
and
see
what
can
be
done
so
we
went
to
the
stationmaster
and
jean
produced
his
papers
and
julie
produced
hers
and
the
old
professor
from
liège
produced
his
and
i
produced
my
english
passport
jean
talked
a
great
deal
and
the
stationmaster
shook
his
head
a
great
deal
and
there
was
an
endless
colloquy
such
as
belgians
dearly
love
and
just
as
i
thought
everything
was
lost
the
stationmaster
hastened
off
into
the
dark
with
a
little
lantern
and
told
us
to
follow
him
right
across
the
train
lines
and
we
came
to
a
bewildering
mass
of
lights
and
at
last
we
reached
a
spot
in
the
middle
of
many
train
lines
which
seemed
extremely
dangerous
when
the
stationmaster
said
stand
there
and
when
train
comes
along
get
immediately
into
the
guard
van
there
is
only
one
we
waited
a
long
time
and
the
night
grew
cold
and
dark
before
came
along
when
it
puffed
itself
into
a
possible
position
we
all
performed
miracles
in
the
way
of
climbing
up
an
enormous
step
and
then
we
found
ourselves
in
a
little
wooden
van
with
one
dim
light
burning
and
one
wooden
seat
and
in
we
got
seating
ourselves
in
a
row
on
the
hard
seat
and
off
we
started
through
the
night
for
ghent
looking
through
a
i
suddenly
stifled
an
exclamation
pointing
straight
at
me
were
the
muzzles
of
guns
mais
oui
said
jean
that
is
what
this
train
is
doing
it
is
taking
guns
to
ghent
there
are
big
movements
of
troops
going
on
we
were
shaken
nearly
to
pieces
and
we
went
so
slowly
that
we
scarcely
moved
at
all
but
we
arrived
at
ghent
at
last
arrived
of
course
as
usual
in
war
time
at
a
station
one
had
never
seen
or
heard
of
before
in
a
remote
portion
of
the
town
and
then
we
had
to
find
our
way
back
to
the
town
proper
a
long
long
walk
it
was
twelve
when
we
got
into
the
beautiful
old
dreamlike
town
first
we
went
to
the
hotel
ganda
full
up
said
the
fat
porter
rudely
no
room
even
on
the
floor
to
sleep
can
you
give
us
something
to
eat
we
pleaded
impossible
the
kitchens
are
shut
up
he
was
a
brute
of
a
porter
an
extraordinary
man
who
never
slept
and
was
on
duty
all
night
and
all
day
he
was
hand
in
glove
with
the
germans
all
the
time
his
face
did
not
belie
him
he
looked
the
ugliest
stealthiest
creature
shewing
a
covert
rudeness
towards
all
people
that
many
of
us
remember
now
and
understand
in
the
pitch
darkness
we
set
out
again
clattering
about
the
flagged
streets
of
ghent
a
determined
little
party
now
with
our
high
spirits
quite
unchecked
by
hunger
and
fatigue
to
try
to
find
some
sleeping
place
for
the
night
from
hotel
to
hotel
we
wandered
everyone
was
full
evidently
a
vast
body
of
troops
had
arrived
at
ghent
that
day
but
finally
at
one
we
went
last
of
all
to
the
hotel
we
should
have
gone
to
first
that
was
the
hôtel
de
la
poste
it
being
the
chief
hotel
at
ghent
we
had
felt
certain
it
would
be
impossible
to
get
accommodation
there
but
other
people
had
evidently
thought
so
too
and
the
result
was
we
all
got
a
room
from
the
outside
the
hotel
appeared
to
be
in
pitch
darkness
but
when
we
got
within
we
found
lights
burning
and
great
companies
of
belgian
cavalry
officers
gathered
in
the
lounge
and
halls
finishing
their
supper
there
are
great
movements
of
troops
going
on
said
jean
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
seen
our
army
in
ghent
to
my
delight
i
recognised
my
two
friends
from
aerschot
the
brussels
nuts
on
hearing
that
i
was
going
to
brussels
one
of
them
begged
me
to
go
and
see
his
father
and
sister
if
i
got
safely
there
and
i
gladly
promised
to
do
so
after
that
about
two
in
the
morning
it
was
then
we
crawled
down
some
steps
into
the
cellar
where
the
most
welcome
supper
i
have
ever
eaten
soon
pulled
us
all
round
again
cold
fowl
red
wine
delicious
bread
and
butter
then
we
went
up
to
our
rooms
giving
strict
injunctions
to
be
called
at
six
and
for
four
hours
we
slept
the
sleep
of
the
thoroughly
tired
out
next
morning
at
six
we
were
all
down
and
had
our
in
the
restaurant
and
then
started
off
cheerfully
to
the
principal
railway
station
so
far
so
good
all
we
had
to
do
now
was
to
get
into
a
train
and
be
carried
straight
to
brussels
why
then
did
jean
look
so
agitated
when
we
went
to
the
ticket
office
and
asked
for
our
tickets
he
turned
to
us
with
a
shrug
ah
ces
allemands
one
never
knows
what
the
cochons
are
going
to
do
the
stationmaster
here
says
that
the
trains
may
not
run
into
brussels
he
wo
book
us
further
than
grammont
he
believes
the
lines
are
cut
from
there
on
i
was
so
absorbed
in
watching
the
enormous
crowds
on
the
ghent
station
that
the
seriousness
of
that
statement
passed
me
by
i
did
not
realise
where
grammont
was
and
it
did
not
occur
to
me
to
wonder
by
what
means
i
was
going
to
get
from
grammont
to
brussels
i
only
urged
that
we
should
go
on
the
old
professor
and
madame
julie
argued
as
to
whether
it
would
not
be
better
to
abandon
their
plans
and
return
to
antwerp
that
seemed
to
me
a
tedious
idea
so
i
did
my
best
to
push
on
jean
agreed
at
any
rate
he
said
we
will
go
as
far
as
grammont
and
see
what
happens
there
perhaps
by
the
time
we
get
there
we
shall
find
everything
alright
again
so
at
seven
we
steamed
away
from
ghent
out
into
the
fresh
bright
countryside
now
we
were
in
the
region
of
danger
we
were
outside
the
of
the
belgian
army
if
one
came
this
way
one
came
at
one
risk
but
as
i
looked
from
the
train
windows
everything
seemed
so
peaceful
that
i
could
scarcely
imagine
there
was
danger
there
were
no
ruins
here
there
was
no
sign
of
war
at
all
only
little
farms
and
villages
bathed
in
the
blue
september
sunlight
with
the
peasants
working
in
the
fields
as
i
tried
to
push
my
window
higher
someone
who
was
leaning
from
the
next
window
spoke
to
me
in
english
and
i
met
a
pair
of
blue
eyes
may
i
fix
that
window
for
you
i
guess
you
english
are
you
i
gave
him
one
quick
hard
look
it
was
the
war
look
that
raked
a
face
with
a
lightning
glance
by
now
i
had
come
to
depend
absolutely
on
the
result
of
my
glance
yes
i
said
and
you
are
american
he
admitted
that
was
so
almost
immediately
we
fell
into
talk
about
the
war
how
long
do
you
think
it
will
last
asked
the
american
i
do
know
what
do
you
think
i
give
it
six
weeks
i
be
over
then
and
he
assured
me
that
was
the
general
opinion
of
those
he
knew
six
weeks
or
less
but
what
are
you
doing
in
this
train
he
added
interestedly
going
to
brussels
brussels
he
looked
at
me
with
amazed
eyes
pardon
me
did
you
say
going
to
brussels
yes
pardon
me
but
how
are
you
going
to
get
to
brussels
i
am
going
there
but
you
are
english
yes
then
you
ca
have
a
german
passport
to
get
into
brussels
if
you
are
english
no
i
have
got
one
but
do
you
realise
that
to
get
into
brussels
you
have
got
to
go
through
the
german
lines
we
began
to
discuss
the
question
he
was
an
american
who
had
friends
in
brussels
and
was
going
there
on
business
his
name
was
richards
he
was
a
kindly
nice
man
he
could
speak
neither
french
nor
flemish
and
had
a
belgian
with
him
to
interpret
what
do
you
think
i
ought
to
do
i
asked
go
back
he
promptly
said
if
the
germans
stop
you
they
take
you
prisoner
and
even
if
you
do
get
in
he
added
you
will
never
get
out
it
is
even
harder
to
get
out
of
brussels
than
it
is
to
get
in
i
going
to
chance
it
well
if
that
so
the
only
thing
i
can
suggest
is
that
if
you
do
manage
to
get
into
brussels
safely
you
go
to
the
american
consulate
and
shew
them
your
papers
and
they
may
give
you
a
paper
that
help
you
to
get
out
illustration
passport
from
the
australian
high
commissioner
but
would
the
americans
do
that
for
a
british
subject
sure
we
a
neutral
country
as
a
little
american
boy
said
neutral
i
do
care
which
country
whips
the
germans
then
another
idea
occurred
to
richards
but
you
must
go
into
brussels
with
an
english
passport
about
you
you
have
to
hide
that
somehow
i
shall
give
it
to
monsieur
jean
to
hide
i
said
he
the
conductor
of
the
little
belgian
party
there
well
let
me
see
your
passport
then
in
case
you
have
to
part
with
it
and
you
arrive
in
brussels
without
it
i
can
satisfy
our
consul
that
i
have
seen
it
and
that
you
are
an
english
subject
and
that
will
make
things
easier
for
you
at
the
american
consulate
i
showed
him
my
passport
and
he
examined
it
carefully
and
promised
to
do
what
he
could
to
help
me
in
brussels
then
we
arrived
at
grammont
and
there
the
worst
happened
the
train
lines
were
cut
and
we
could
go
no
further
by
rail
to
get
to
brussels
we
must
drive
by
the
roads
all
the
way
chapter
xi
brabant
it
was
like
a
chapter
out
of
quite
another
story
to
leave
the
train
at
grammont
and
find
ourselves
in
the
flagged
old
brabant
square
in
front
of
the
station
that
hot
glittering
morning
while
on
the
ear
rose
a
deafening
babel
of
voices
from
the
hundreds
of
little
belgian
carts
and
carriages
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
and
descriptions
that
stood
there
with
their
drivers
leaning
forward
over
their
skinny
horses
yelling
for
fares
the
american
hurried
to
me
as
i
stood
watching
with
deep
interest
this
vivacious
scene
which
reminded
me
of
some
old
piazza
in
italy
and
quite
took
away
the
sharp
edge
of
the
adventure
the
sharp
edge
being
the
germans
who
now
were
not
very
far
away
judging
by
the
dull
roar
of
cannon
that
was
here
distinctly
audible
the
american
said
i
have
found
this
little
trap
that
will
take
us
to
brussels
for
fourteen
francs
right
into
brussels
and
there
is
a
seat
for
you
in
that
trap
if
you
care
to
come
i
be
very
pleased
and
happy
to
have
you
come
along
with
me
it
is
awfully
good
of
you
i
said
i
knew
he
was
running
great
risks
in
taking
me
with
him
and
i
deeply
appreciated
his
kindness
but
jean
remonstrated
a
little
hurt
at
the
suggestion
madame
you
are
of
our
party
we
must
stick
together
i
just
found
a
trap
here
that
will
take
us
all
there
are
four
other
people
already
in
it
and
that
will
make
eight
altogether
the
driver
will
take
us
to
brussels
for
twelve
francs
each
with
an
extra
five
francs
if
we
get
there
safely
so
i
waved
to
the
little
cart
with
the
friendly
american
who
waved
back
as
he
drove
away
into
the
sunlight
shouting
good
luck
luck
as
i
heard
that
english
word
come
ringing
across
the
flagged
old
brabant
village
it
was
as
though
i
realised
its
meaning
for
the
first
time
good
luck
and
my
heart
clutched
at
it
and
clung
to
it
searching
for
strength
as
the
heart
of
women
and
men
too
will
do
in
war
time
chapter
xii
driving
extraordinary
the
task
of
arranging
that
party
in
the
waggonette
was
anything
but
easy
the
old
liège
professor
in
his
sombre
black
sat
on
the
back
seat
while
in
front
sat
an
equally
enormous
old
banker
from
brussels
also
in
black
and
those
two
huge
men
seemed
to
stick
up
out
of
the
carriage
like
vast
black
pillars
they
moved
their
seats
afterwards
but
it
did
not
make
any
difference
wherever
they
sat
they
stuck
up
like
huge
black
pillars
calling
attention
to
us
in
what
seemed
to
me
a
distinctly
undesirable
way
two
horses
we
had
for
our
long
drive
to
brussels
and
uncommonly
bony
horses
they
were
our
carriage
was
a
species
of
victoria
it
had
an
extra
seat
behind
with
its
back
to
the
horses
a
horrid
tilting
little
seat
as
i
soon
discovered
for
it
was
there
that
i
found
myself
sitting
with
jean
beside
me
as
we
started
off
through
the
golden
saturday
morning
jean
and
i
had
each
to
curl
an
arm
round
the
back
of
the
seat
otherwise
we
should
have
been
tipped
out
for
a
tremendously
steep
white
lined
with
poplars
began
to
rise
before
us
and
we
were
in
constant
danger
of
falling
forward
on
our
noses
but
the
only
thing
i
cared
about
by
then
was
to
sit
next
to
jean
he
seemed
to
be
my
only
safeguard
my
only
hope
of
getting
through
this
risky
adventure
and
in
low
voices
we
discussed
what
i
should
do
if
we
did
indeed
meet
the
enemy
a
contingency
which
began
to
grow
more
and
more
probable
every
moment
all
sorts
of
schemes
were
discussed
between
us
sitting
there
at
the
back
of
that
jolting
carriage
but
it
was
quite
evident
to
both
that
though
we
might
make
up
a
plausible
story
as
to
why
i
was
going
to
brussels
although
i
might
call
myself
an
american
or
an
italian
or
a
spaniard
seeing
that
i
could
speak
those
languages
well
enough
to
deceive
the
germans
and
seeing
also
that
i
had
the
letter
to
the
spanish
minister
in
my
bag
from
the
at
antwerp
still
neither
i
nor
jean
could
do
the
one
thing
necessary
we
could
not
produce
any
papers
of
mine
that
would
satisfy
the
germans
if
i
fell
into
their
hands
but
we
not
going
to
meet
them
said
jean
he
lit
a
cigarette
you
had
better
give
me
all
your
papers
he
added
airily
what
will
you
do
with
them
he
smoked
and
thought
if
we
meet
the
germans
i
throw
them
away
somewhere
but
how
on
earth
shall
i
ever
get
them
again
and
suppose
the
germans
see
you
throwing
them
away
i
did
not
like
the
phrase
throw
them
away
it
seemed
like
taking
from
me
the
most
precious
thing
in
the
world
the
one
thing
that
i
had
firmly
determined
never
to
part
with
my
passport
but
i
now
discovered
that
jean
had
a
thoughtful
mood
upon
him
and
did
not
want
to
talk
he
wanted
to
think
he
told
me
so
he
said
it
is
necessary
that
i
think
out
many
little
things
now
pardon
and
he
tapped
his
brow
so
i
left
him
to
it
along
the
white
road
as
we
drove
we
met
a
continual
procession
of
carts
waggons
fiacres
and
vehicles
of
all
shapes
kinds
and
descriptions
full
of
peasants
or
bourgeoisie
all
travelling
in
the
direction
of
ghent
every
now
and
then
a
private
motor
car
would
flash
past
us
flying
the
red
white
and
blue
flag
of
holland
or
the
stars
and
stripes
of
america
they
had
an
almost
impudent
insouciance
with
them
those
lucky
neutral
motor
cars
as
they
rushed
along
the
sunny
brabant
road
to
brussels
joyously
confident
that
there
would
be
no
trouble
for
them
if
they
met
the
germans
how
i
envied
them
how
i
longed
to
be
able
by
some
magic
to
prove
myself
american
or
dutch
every
ten
minutes
or
so
we
used
to
shout
to
people
on
the
road
coming
from
the
opposite
direction
y
a
des
allemands
or
y
a
de
danger
the
answer
would
come
back
des
allemands
or
les
allemands
sont
pointing
to
the
right
or
allemands
sont
pointing
to
the
left
i
would
feel
horribly
uncomfortable
then
although
apparently
i
was
not
frightened
in
the
least
there
was
one
thing
that
undeceived
me
about
myself
i
had
lost
the
power
to
think
as
clearly
as
usual
i
found
that
my
brain
refused
to
consider
what
i
should
do
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
whenever
i
got
to
that
point
my
thoughts
jibbed
vagueness
seized
upon
me
i
only
knew
that
i
was
in
for
it
now
that
i
was
seated
there
in
that
old
rickety
carriage
that
i
was
well
inside
the
german
lines
and
that
it
was
too
late
to
turn
back
in
a
way
it
was
a
relief
to
feel
incapable
of
dealing
with
the
situation
because
it
set
my
mind
free
to
observe
the
exquisite
beauty
of
the
country
we
were
travelling
through
and
the
golden
sweetness
of
that
september
day
up
and
up
that
long
steep
white
hill
our
carriage
climbed
with
rows
of
wonderful
high
poplars
waving
in
the
breeze
on
either
side
of
us
and
gracious
grey
belgian
châteaux
shewing
their
beautiful
lines
through
vistas
of
gardens
and
green
undulating
woods
of
such
richness
and
fertility
and
calm
happy
opulence
that
the
sound
of
the
cannon
growing
ever
louder
across
the
valleys
almost
lost
its
meaning
in
such
a
fair
enchanted
country
but
the
breeze
blew
round
us
a
soft
and
gentle
breeze
laden
with
the
scent
of
flowers
and
green
things
red
pears
of
great
size
and
mellowness
hung
on
the
orchard
trees
the
purple
cabbage
that
the
brabant
peasants
cultivate
made
bright
spots
along
the
ground
in
the
villages
at
the
doors
of
the
little
white
cottages
i
saw
old
wrinkled
belgian
women
sitting
little
children
with
peculiarly
small
sweet
faces
stood
looking
up
and
down
the
long
roads
with
an
expression
that
often
brought
the
tears
to
my
eyes
as
i
realised
the
fears
that
those
poor
little
baby
hearts
must
be
filled
with
in
those
desperate
days
and
yet
the
prevailing
note
of
the
people
we
met
along
that
road
was
still
gaiety
rather
than
sadness
or
terror
y
a
des
allemands
y
a
de
danger
we
went
on
perpetually
with
our
questions
and
the
answers
would
come
back
laughingly
with
shakings
of
the
head
no
not
met
any
germans
or
they
are
fighting
round
ninove
we
been
making
détours
all
the
morning
to
try
and
get
out
of
their
way
and
now
the
road
was
so
steep
that
jean
and
i
jumped
down
from
our
sloping
seat
at
the
back
and
walked
up
the
hill
to
save
the
bony
horses
every
now
and
then
we
would
pause
to
look
back
at
that
wide
dreamlike
view
which
grew
more
and
more
magnificent
the
higher
we
ascended
until
at
last
fair
brabant
lay
stretched
out
behind
us
bathed
in
a
glittering
sunlight
that
had
in
it
that
day
some
exquisitely
poignant
quality
as
though
it
were
more
golden
than
gold
just
because
across
that
great
plain
to
the
left
the
fierce
detonations
of
heavy
artillery
told
of
the
terrific
struggles
that
were
going
on
there
for
life
and
death
presently
we
met
a
couple
of
belgian
priests
walking
down
the
hill
and
mopping
their
pale
faces
under
their
black
felt
hats
the
germans
are
all
over
the
place
they
told
us
and
yesterday
they
arrested
a
of
people
between
enghien
and
hall
they
suspected
them
of
carrying
letters
into
brussels
so
they
cut
the
train
lines
last
night
and
marched
the
people
off
to
be
searched
the
young
men
have
been
sent
into
germany
or
so
rumour
says
that
may
or
may
not
be
true
but
anyway
it
is
quite
true
that
the
of
passengers
was
arrested
wholesale
and
that
every
single
one
of
them
was
searched
and
those
who
were
found
carrying
letters
were
taken
prisoners
perhaps
to
be
shot
ça
said
jean
coolly
we
bade
the
priests
and
trudged
on
jean
presently
under
his
breath
said
i
got
a
hundred
letters
in
my
pockets
i
taking
them
from
antwerp
people
into
brussels
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
leave
them
somewhere
he
smiled
his
queer
smile
showing
all
his
white
teeth
and
i
felt
sure
that
he
was
planning
something
i
felt
certain
he
was
not
going
to
be
baulked
at
the
top
of
the
hill
we
got
into
our
trap
again
and
off
we
started
travelling
at
a
great
rate
we
dashed
along
and
vehicles
dashed
past
us
in
the
opposite
direction
and
i
had
the
feeling
that
i
was
going
for
a
picnic
so
bright
was
the
day
so
beautiful
the
surroundings
so
quick
the
movements
along
the
road
at
enghien
said
jean
turning
round
and
addressing
the
other
people
in
the
carriage
by
now
they
had
all
made
friends
with
each
other
and
were
chattering
nineteen
to
the
dozen
at
enghien
we
shall
get
lunch
but
there
is
nowhere
that
one
finds
lunch
at
enghien
protested
the
fat
brussels
banker
i
promise
you
as
good
a
lunch
as
ever
you
have
eaten
and
good
wine
to
wash
it
down
was
jean
reply
at
last
we
arrived
at
enghien
and
found
ourselves
in
a
little
brown
straggling
picturesque
village
on
a
hillside
full
of
peasants
who
were
gathered
in
a
dense
crowd
in
the
grand
place
which
was
here
the
village
common
they
had
come
in
out
of
the
fields
these
peasants
stained
with
mud
and
all
the
discolourations
of
the
soil
their
innocent
faces
spoke
of
the
calm
sweet
things
of
nature
but
mixed
with
the
innocence
was
a
great
wonder
and
bewilderment
now
all
this
time
ever
since
we
left
ghent
we
had
never
seen
a
belgian
that
of
itself
told
its
own
story
of
how
completely
we
were
outside
the
last
chance
of
belgian
outside
dernière
chapter
xiii
the
lunch
at
enghien
dear
little
enghien
i
shall
always
remember
you
it
was
so
to
drive
to
the
railway
station
and
have
one
lunch
cooked
by
the
stationmaster
a
dear
old
man
he
was
that
old
belgian
a
hero
too
his
trains
were
stopped
his
lines
were
cut
he
was
ever
in
the
midst
of
the
germans
but
he
kept
his
bright
spirits
happy
and
when
jean
ushered
us
all
in
to
his
little
house
that
formed
part
of
the
railway
station
he
received
us
as
if
we
were
old
friends
shook
us
all
by
the
hand
and
told
us
with
great
gusto
exactly
what
he
would
give
us
and
he
rolled
the
words
out
too
almost
as
though
he
was
an
italian
as
he
promised
us
a
omelette
followed
by
a
and
fried
potatoes
and
cheese
and
fruit
and
a
then
he
hurried
away
into
the
kitchen
and
we
heard
him
cracking
the
eggs
while
his
old
sister
set
the
table
in
the
little
we
travellers
all
sat
on
a
seat
out
in
front
of
the
railway
line
under
the
sweet
blue
sky
facing
green
fields
and
refreshed
ourselves
with
little
glasses
of
red
byrrh
it
was
characteristic
of
those
dear
belgian
souls
that
they
one
and
all
raised
their
little
glasses
before
they
drank
and
looking
towards
me
said
to
which
i
responded
with
my
tiny
glass
la
belgique
and
we
all
added
bas
le
kaiser
and
from
across
the
fields
the
noise
of
the
battle
round
ninove
came
towards
us
louder
and
louder
every
moment
as
we
sat
there
we
discussed
the
cannonading
that
now
seemed
very
near
so
loud
and
so
close
to
us
were
the
angry
growlings
of
the
guns
that
i
felt
amazed
at
not
being
able
to
see
any
smoke
it
was
evident
that
some
big
encounter
was
going
on
but
the
fields
were
green
and
still
and
nothing
at
all
was
to
be
seen
by
now
i
had
lost
all
sense
of
reality
i
was
merely
a
figure
in
an
extraordinary
dream
in
which
the
great
guns
pounded
on
my
right
hand
and
the
old
stationmaster
omelette
fried
loudly
on
my
left
jean
strolled
off
alone
while
two
of
the
ladies
of
the
party
went
away
to
buy
some
butter
in
brussels
they
said
it
was
impossible
to
get
good
butter
under
exorbitant
prices
so
they
paid
a
visit
to
a
little
farm
a
few
steps
away
and
came
back
presently
laden
with
butter
enough
to
keep
them
going
for
several
weeks
for
which
they
had
paid
only
one
franc
each
and
now
the
old
stationmaster
comes
out
and
summons
us
all
in
to
lunch
he
wishes
us
and
we
seat
ourselves
round
the
table
under
the
portraits
of
king
albert
and
petite
in
his
little
a
merrier
lunch
than
that
was
never
eaten
the
vast
omelette
melted
away
in
a
twinkling
before
the
terrific
onslaught
made
upon
it
chiefly
by
the
liège
professor
and
the
brussels
banker
who
by
now
had
got
up
their
appetites
the
red
cross
lady
who
took
it
upon
herself
to
help
out
the
food
kept
up
a
cheerful
little
commentary
of
running
compliments
which
included
us
all
and
the
and
the
omelette
and
the
potatoes
and
the
stationmaster
until
we
could
hardly
tell
one
from
the
other
so
agreeable
did
we
all
seem
the
old
stationmaster
produced
some
good
burgundy
purply
red
of
a
most
respectable
age
when
everything
was
on
the
table
he
brought
his
chair
and
joined
in
with
us
asking
questions
about
antwerp
and
ghent
and
ostend
and
giving
us
in
return
vivid
sketches
of
what
the
germans
had
been
doing
in
his
part
of
the
world
the
extraordinary
part
of
all
this
was
that
though
we
were
in
a
region
inhabited
by
the
germans
there
was
no
sign
of
destruction
the
absence
of
ruin
and
pillage
seems
to
conceal
the
fact
that
this
was
invested
country
after
our
we
all
shook
hands
with
the
stationmaster
wished
him
good
luck
and
hurried
back
to
the
village
where
we
climbed
into
our
vehicle
again
this
time
i
took
a
place
in
the
inside
of
the
carriage
leaving
jean
and
another
man
to
hang
on
to
that
perilous
back
seat
at
two
we
were
off
the
horses
freshened
by
food
and
water
galloped
along
now
at
a
great
pace
and
the
day
developed
into
an
afternoon
as
cloudless
and
glittering
as
the
morning
but
almost
immediately
after
leaving
enghien
an
ominous
note
began
to
be
struck
whenever
we
shouted
out
our
query
y
a
des
allemands
the
coming
from
the
opposite
direction
shouted
back
oui
beaucoup
and
suddenly
there
they
were
chapter
xiv
we
meet
the
my
first
sight
of
the
german
army
was
just
one
man
he
was
a
motor
cyclist
dressed
in
grey
with
his
weapons
slung
across
his
back
and
he
flashed
past
us
like
lightning
everyone
in
the
carriage
uttered
a
deep
oh
it
seemed
to
me
an
incredible
thing
that
one
german
should
be
all
alone
like
that
among
enemies
i
said
so
to
my
companions
the
others
are
coming
they
said
with
an
air
of
certainty
that
turned
me
cold
all
over
but
it
was
at
least
two
miles
further
on
before
we
met
the
rest
of
his
corps
then
we
discovered
fifty
german
motor
cyclists
in
grey
uniforms
and
flat
caps
flying
smoothly
along
the
side
path
in
one
long
grey
line
their
accoutrements
looked
perfect
and
trim
their
general
appearance
was
strikingly
smart
natty
and
workmanlike
in
the
extreme
just
before
they
reached
us
jean
got
down
and
walked
on
foot
along
the
road
at
the
edge
of
the
side
path
where
they
were
riding
and
as
they
passed
quite
near
him
jean
turned
his
glance
towards
me
and
gave
me
an
enormous
wink
i
do
know
whether
that
was
jean
sense
of
humour
i
always
forgot
afterwards
to
ask
him
what
it
meant
i
only
know
that
it
had
a
peculiarly
cheering
effect
on
me
to
see
that
great
black
eye
winking
and
then
turning
itself
with
a
quiet
careless
gaze
on
the
faces
of
the
fifty
german
cyclists
they
passed
without
doing
more
than
casting
a
look
at
us
and
were
lost
to
sight
in
a
moment
flashing
onwards
with
tremendous
speed
towards
enghien
we
were
now
on
the
brow
of
a
hill
and
as
we
reached
it
and
began
to
descend
we
were
confronted
with
a
spectacle
that
fairly
took
away
my
breath
the
long
white
road
before
us
was
literally
lined
with
germans
chapter
xv
face
to
face
with
the
huns
yes
there
they
were
and
when
i
found
myself
face
to
face
with
those
five
hundred
advancing
germans
about
two
kilometres
out
of
enghien
i
quite
believed
i
was
about
to
lose
my
chance
of
getting
to
brussels
and
of
seeing
the
man
i
was
so
anxious
to
see
little
did
i
dream
at
that
moment
out
there
on
the
sunny
brabant
hillside
seated
in
the
old
voiture
with
that
long
line
of
germans
filling
the
white
dusty
highway
far
and
wide
with
their
infantry
and
artillery
their
cannon
and
the
prancing
horses
of
their
officers
and
their
gleaming
blue
and
scarlet
uniforms
and
glittering
appointments
that
it
was
not
i
who
was
going
to
be
taken
prisoner
by
les
allemands
that
brilliant
saturday
afternoon
but
max
of
brussels
himself
up
and
down
the
long
steep
white
road
to
brussels
the
germans
halted
shouting
in
stentorian
voices
that
we
were
to
do
likewise
our
driver
quickly
brought
his
two
bony
horses
to
a
standstill
and
in
the
open
carriage
with
me
our
queer
haphazard
party
sat
as
if
turned
to
stone
the
red
cross
belgian
lady
had
already
hidden
her
red
cross
in
her
stocking
so
that
the
germans
if
we
met
them
should
not
seize
her
and
oblige
her
to
perform
red
cross
duties
in
their
hated
service
the
guttural
voice
of
an
erect
old
german
colonel
fell
on
my
ears
like
a
bad
dream
as
he
brought
his
big
prancing
grey
horse
alongside
our
driver
and
demanded
roughly
what
we
were
doing
there
while
in
the
same
bad
dream
as
i
sat
there
in
my
corner
of
the
voiture
i
watched
the
expressions
written
all
over
those
hundreds
of
fierce
fair
arrogant
faces
staring
at
us
from
every
direction
in
a
blaze
of
hatred
i
told
myself
that
if
ever
the
brute
could
be
seen
rampant
in
human
beings
faces
there
it
was
rampant
uncontrolled
unashamed
only
just
escaping
from
being
degraded
by
the
accompanying
expressions
of
burning
arrogance
and
indomitable
determination
that
blazed
out
of
those
hundreds
of
blue
teutonic
eyes
the
set
of
their
lips
was
firm
and
grim
beyond
all
words
often
a
peculiar
ironic
smirk
caused
by
the
upturning
of
the
corners
of
their
otherwise
straight
lips
seemed
to
add
to
their
demoniac
suggestiveness
but
their
physique
was
magnificent
and
there
was
not
a
man
among
them
who
did
not
look
every
inch
a
soldier
from
his
blucher
boots
upwards
as
i
studied
them
drinking
in
the
unforgettable
picture
it
gave
me
a
certain
amount
of
satisfaction
to
know
that
i
was
setting
my
own
small
womanly
daring
up
against
that
great
mass
of
unbridled
cruelty
and
conceit
and
i
sat
very
still
very
still
indeed
stiller
than
any
mouse
allowing
myself
the
supreme
luxury
of
a
contemptuous
curl
of
my
lips
picture
after
picture
of
the
ruined
cities
i
had
seen
in
belgium
flashed
like
lightning
over
my
memory
out
there
on
the
sunny
brabant
hillside
again
i
saw
before
me
the
horrors
that
i
had
seen
with
my
own
eyes
at
aerschot
termonde
and
louvain
and
then
instead
of
feeling
frightened
i
experienced
nothing
but
a
scorn
that
entirely
lifted
me
above
the
terrible
stress
of
the
encounter
and
whether
i
lived
or
died
mattered
not
the
least
bit
in
the
world
beside
the
satisfaction
of
sitting
there
an
english
subject
looking
down
at
the
german
army
with
that
contemptuous
curl
of
my
lips
and
that
blaze
of
hatred
in
my
heart
meanwhile
our
driver
passport
with
his
photograph
was
being
examined
who
is
this
shouted
the
silly
old
german
colonel
pointing
to
the
photograph
moi
replied
the
driver
and
his
expression
seemed
to
say
who
on
earth
did
you
think
it
was
the
fat
colonel
who
obviously
did
not
understand
a
word
of
french
kept
roaring
away
for
one
schultz
who
seemed
to
be
some
distance
off
the
roaring
and
shouting
went
on
for
several
minutes
it
was
a
curious
manifestation
of
german
lack
of
dignity
and
i
tried
in
vain
to
imagine
an
english
colonel
roaring
at
his
men
like
that
then
schultz
came
galloping
up
he
acted
as
interpreter
and
an
amusing
dialogue
went
on
between
the
roaring
colonel
and
the
young
dashing
baverois
who
was
obviously
a
less
brutal
type
than
his
interrogator
the
old
banker
from
brussels
was
next
questioned
and
his
passport
to
come
in
and
out
of
brussels
being
correctly
made
out
in
german
and
french
the
germans
seized
upon
jean
and
demanded
what
he
was
doing
there
why
he
was
going
to
brussels
and
why
he
had
been
to
grammont
jean
answer
was
that
he
lived
in
brussels
and
had
been
to
grammont
to
see
his
relations
and
schultz
explanations
rendered
this
so
convincing
that
the
lawyer
passport
was
handed
back
to
him
you
are
sure
none
of
you
have
no
correspondence
no
newspapers
roared
the
colonel
what
is
in
that
bag
leaning
into
the
carriage
a
soldier
prodded
at
bag
i
dared
not
attempt
to
speak
my
english
origin
might
betray
me
in
my
french
i
sat
silent
i
made
no
reply
i
tried
to
look
entirely
uninterested
but
i
was
really
almost
unconscious
with
dread
but
the
red
cross
lady
replied
with
quiet
dignity
that
there
was
nothing
in
her
bag
but
requisites
for
the
journey
next
moment
as
in
a
dream
i
heard
that
roaring
voice
shout
gut
get
on
our
driver
whipped
lightly
the
carriage
moved
forward
and
we
proceeded
on
our
way
filled
with
queer
thoughts
that
sprang
from
nerves
and
hearts
beating
only
jean
remained
imperturbable
quel
chance
they
were
nearly
all
baverois
did
you
see
the
dragon
embroidered
on
their
pouches
the
baverois
are
always
plus
gentilles
than
any
of
the
others
this
was
something
i
had
heard
over
and
over
again
according
to
the
belgians
these
baverois
had
all
through
the
war
manifested
a
better
spirit
towards
the
belgians
than
any
other
german
regiment
the
accredited
reason
being
that
the
belgian
queen
is
of
bavarian
nationality
when
the
uhlans
slashed
up
the
queen
portrait
in
the
royal
palace
at
brussels
the
baverois
lost
their
tempers
and
a
fierce
brawl
ensued
in
which
seven
men
were
killed
all
the
belgians
in
our
old
ramshackle
carriage
were
loud
in
their
expressions
of
thankfulness
that
we
had
encountered
baverois
instead
of
uhlans
so
at
last
that
dread
mysterious
darksome
quantity
known
as
les
allemands
ever
moving
hither
and
thither
across
belgium
always
talked
of
on
the
other
side
of
the
belgian
lines
but
never
seen
had
materialised
right
under
my
very
eyes
the
beautiful
rich
brabant
orchard
country
stretched
away
on
either
side
of
the
road
and
behind
us
along
the
road
ran
like
a
wash
of
indigo
the
brilliant
prussian
blue
of
the
moving
german
cavalcade
making
now
towards
enghien
and
grammont
and
now
the
old
professor
from
liège
drew
all
attention
towards
himself
he
was
shaking
and
quivering
like
a
jelly
peur
he
said
simply
mais
non
monsieur
cried
jean
it
all
over
now
courage
pas
de
cried
everyone
encouragingly
it
was
only
a
ruse
of
the
enemy
letting
us
go
whispered
the
professor
they
will
follow
and
shoot
us
from
behind
plaintively
as
a
child
he
asked
the
fat
brussels
banker
to
allow
him
to
change
places
and
sit
in
front
instead
of
behind
in
a
sudden
rebound
of
spirits
the
red
cross
lady
and
i
laughingly
sat
on
the
back
seat
and
opened
our
parasols
behind
us
while
the
old
brussels
banker
when
the
two
fat
men
had
exchanged
seats
not
without
difficulty
whispered
to
us
and
all
the
while
there
are
a
hundred
letters
sewn
up
inside
the
cushion
of
the
seat
our
friend
from
liège
is
sitting
on
chapter
xvi
a
prayer
for
his
soul
on
we
drove
on
and
on
all
the
road
to
brussels
was
patrolled
now
at
the
gates
of
villa
gardens
on
the
side
paths
grey
german
sentries
were
posted
bayonets
fixed
we
drove
through
germans
all
the
way
they
looked
at
us
quietly
once
only
were
we
stopped
again
and
this
time
it
was
only
the
passport
that
was
looked
at
at
last
we
arrived
at
hall
an
brabant
town
containing
a
miracle
as
far
as
i
can
remember
it
was
a
bomb
from
some
bygone
war
that
came
through
the
church
wall
and
was
caught
in
the
skirts
of
the
madonna
hall
said
jean
is
now
the
headquarters
of
the
german
army
in
belgium
the
has
been
moved
here
from
brussels
he
is
in
residence
at
the
hôtel
de
ville
voilà
see
the
germans
they
always
pose
themselves
like
that
on
the
steps
where
there
are
any
steps
to
pose
on
ah
mais
triste
mon
pauvre
belgique
we
clattered
up
the
main
street
and
stopped
at
a
little
café
facing
the
hotel
de
ville
stiffly
we
alighted
from
our
waggonette
and
entering
the
café
quenched
our
thirst
in
lemonade
watching
the
germans
through
the
window
as
we
rested
nervous
as
i
was
myself
i
admired
the
belgians
sangfroid
they
manifested
not
the
slightest
signs
of
nervousness
scorn
was
their
leading
characteristic
then
a
sad
little
story
reached
my
ears
an
old
peasant
was
telling
jean
that
an
english
aviator
had
been
shot
down
at
hall
the
day
before
and
was
buried
somewhere
near
how
i
longed
to
look
for
my
brave
countryman
grave
but
that
was
impossible
instead
i
breathed
a
prayer
for
his
soul
and
thought
of
him
and
his
great
courage
with
tenderness
and
respect
it
was
all
i
could
do
chapter
xvii
brussels
finally
after
a
wild
and
breathless
drive
of
miles
through
rich
all
the
way
and
always
between
german
patrols
we
entered
brussels
crowds
of
german
officers
and
men
were
dashing
about
in
motor
cars
in
all
directions
while
the
populace
moved
by
them
as
though
they
were
ghosts
taking
not
the
slightest
notice
of
their
presence
the
sunlight
had
faded
now
and
the
lights
were
being
lit
in
brussels
and
i
gazed
about
me
filled
with
an
inordinate
curiosity
at
first
i
thought
the
people
seemed
to
be
moving
about
just
as
usual
but
soon
i
discovered
an
immense
difference
between
these
brussels
crowds
and
those
of
normal
times
and
conditions
it
was
as
though
all
the
red
roses
and
carnations
had
been
picked
out
of
the
garden
the
smart
world
had
completely
disappeared
those
exquisite
women
and
elegant
young
and
old
men
that
made
such
persuasive
notes
among
the
streets
and
shops
of
brussels
in
ordinary
times
had
vanished
completely
under
the
german
occupation
in
their
place
was
now
a
rambling
roaming
crowd
of
the
lower
dashed
with
a
big
sprinkling
of
wrinkled
peasants
from
the
brabant
country
outside
who
had
come
into
the
big
city
for
the
protection
of
the
lights
and
the
houses
and
the
companionship
even
though
the
dreaded
allemands
were
there
listlessly
people
strolled
about
they
looked
in
the
shop
windows
but
nobody
bought
no
business
seemed
to
be
done
at
all
except
in
the
provision
shops
where
i
saw
groups
of
german
officers
and
soldiers
buying
sausages
cheese
and
eggs
crowds
gathered
before
the
german
notices
pasted
on
the
walls
so
continuously
that
brussels
was
half
covered
beneath
these
great
black
and
white
printed
declarations
which
as
they
were
always
printed
in
three
languages
german
french
and
flemish
took
up
an
enormous
amount
of
wall
space
here
and
there
dutch
journalists
stood
hastily
copying
these
into
their
now
and
then
from
the
crowd
reading
a
low
voice
would
mutter
languidly
les
sales
cochons
but
more
often
the
brussels
sense
of
humour
would
see
something
funny
in
those
absurd
proclamations
and
people
were
often
to
be
seen
grinning
ironically
at
the
german
official
war
news
specially
concocted
for
the
people
of
brussels
it
was
all
the
direct
opposite
of
the
news
in
belgian
and
english
papers
the
allies
had
just
announced
that
austria
had
broken
down
and
was
on
the
verge
of
a
revolution
the
germans
announced
precisely
the
same
thing
only
of
servia
and
the
brussels
people
coolly
read
the
news
and
passed
on
believing
none
of
it
and
all
the
time
while
the
belgians
moved
dawdlingly
up
and
down
and
round
about
their
favourite
streets
and
arcades
the
germans
kept
up
one
swift
everlasting
rush
flying
past
in
motors
or
striding
quickly
by
with
their
firm
long
tread
they
always
seemed
to
be
going
somewhere
in
a
hurry
or
doing
something
extraordinarily
definite
after
i
had
been
five
minutes
in
brussels
i
became
aware
of
this
curious
sense
of
immense
and
unceasing
german
activity
flowing
like
some
loud
swift
resistless
current
through
the
dull
depleted
stream
of
brussels
life
all
day
long
it
went
without
ceasing
and
all
night
too
in
and
out
of
the
city
in
and
out
of
the
city
in
and
out
of
the
city
past
the
deserted
lace
shops
with
their
exquisite
delicate
contents
past
the
many
closed
hotels
past
the
great
white
beauties
of
brussels
architecture
past
the
proud
but
yellowing
avenues
of
trees
along
the
heights
past
those
sculptured
monuments
of
belgians
who
fell
in
bygone
battles
and
now
in
the
light
of
leapt
afresh
into
life
again
galvanised
back
into
reality
by
the
shriek
of
a
thousand
and
the
blood
poured
warm
on
the
blackened
fields
of
belgium
we
drove
to
an
old
hotel
in
a
quiet
street
and
our
driver
jumped
down
and
rang
the
courtyard
bell
then
the
door
opened
and
an
old
belgian
porter
stood
and
looked
at
us
with
sad
eyes
saying
in
a
low
voice
come
in
quickly
we
all
got
down
and
went
through
the
gateway
we
found
ourselves
in
a
big
old
yellow
stone
courtyard
chilly
and
deserted
the
driver
ran
out
and
returned
carrying
in
his
arms
the
long
flat
from
the
carriage
then
the
old
porter
locked
the
gate
and
we
all
gathered
round
the
brave
little
flemish
driver
who
was
down
on
his
knees
now
over
the
cushion
doing
something
with
a
knife
next
minute
he
held
up
a
bundle
of
letters
and
then
another
and
then
another
and
here
is
your
english
passport
madame
jean
said
to
me
unknown
to
most
of
us
the
driver
and
jean
while
we
waited
at
enghien
had
made
a
slit
in
the
cushion
had
taken
out
some
stuffing
and
put
in
instead
a
great
mass
of
letters
and
papers
for
brussels
then
they
had
wired
up
the
slit
turned
the
cushion
upside
down
and
let
us
sit
on
it
it
was
rather
like
sitting
on
a
mine
only
like
the
heroine
of
the
song
we
did
care
we
did
know
chapter
xviii
burgomaster
max
the
hotel
is
closed
to
the
public
we
shut
it
up
so
that
we
should
not
have
germans
coming
in
says
the
little
bruxellois
widow
who
owns
it
but
if
madame
likes
to
stay
here
for
the
night
we
can
arrange
only
there
is
no
cooking
the
old
professor
from
liège
asks
in
his
pitiful
childlike
way
if
he
can
get
a
room
there
too
he
would
be
glad
so
glad
to
be
in
a
hotel
that
was
not
open
to
the
public
or
the
germans
leaving
my
companions
with
many
expressions
of
friendliness
i
now
rush
off
to
the
hotel
de
ville
accompanied
by
the
faithful
jean
just
as
we
reach
our
destination
we
run
into
the
man
i
have
come
all
this
way
to
see
i
see
a
short
dark
man
with
an
alert
military
bearing
it
seems
to
me
that
this
idol
of
brussels
is
by
no
means
certainly
there
is
nothing
of
the
hero
in
his
piquant
even
somewhat
droll
appearance
but
his
eyes
they
are
truly
extraordinary
they
bulge
right
out
of
their
sockets
they
have
the
sharpness
and
alertness
of
a
terrier
they
are
brilliant
humorous
stern
merry
tender
audacious
glistening
bright
all
at
once
his
beard
is
clipped
his
moustaches
are
large
and
upstanding
his
immaculate
dress
and
careful
grooming
give
him
a
dandified
air
as
befitting
the
most
popular
bachelor
in
europe
who
is
also
an
orphan
to
boot
his
forehead
is
high
and
broad
his
general
appearance
is
immediately
arresting
one
scarcely
knows
why
quite
unlike
the
conventional
burgomaster
type
is
he
max
briefly
explains
that
he
is
on
his
way
to
an
important
meeting
but
he
will
see
me
at
eleven
next
morning
if
i
will
come
to
the
hotel
de
ville
then
he
hurries
off
his
queer
dark
face
lighting
up
with
a
singularly
brilliant
smile
as
he
bids
us
au
revoir
an
historic
moment
that
for
max
has
never
been
seen
in
brussels
since
of
itself
max
face
is
neither
particularly
loveable
nor
particularly
attractive
therefore
this
man
great
hold
over
hearts
is
all
the
more
remarkable
it
must
of
course
be
attributed
in
part
to
the
deep
warm
audacious
personality
that
dwells
behind
his
looks
but
in
truth
max
enormous
popularity
owes
itself
not
only
to
his
electric
personality
his
daring
and
sangfroid
but
also
to
his
which
steered
poor
bewildered
brussels
through
those
terribly
difficult
first
weeks
of
the
german
occupation
nothing
in
history
is
more
touching
more
glorious
than
the
sudden
starting
up
in
time
of
danger
of
some
quiet
unknown
man
who
stamps
his
personality
on
the
world
becomes
the
prop
and
comfort
of
his
nation
is
believed
in
as
christians
believe
in
god
and
makes
manifest
again
the
truth
that
war
so
furiously
and
jealously
attempts
to
crush
and
darken
the
power
of
mind
over
matter
the
mastery
of
good
over
evil
from
this
war
three
such
men
stand
out
immortally
king
albert
max
of
brussels
mercier
of
malines
and
belgium
has
produced
all
three
thrice
fortunate
belgium
each
stone
that
crumbles
from
her
ruined
homes
seems
to
the
watching
world
to
fly
into
the
heavens
and
glow
there
like
a
star
on
foot
swinging
my
big
yellow
furs
closer
round
me
in
the
true
belgian
manner
i
walked
along
at
jean
side
trying
to
convince
myself
that
this
was
all
real
this
brussels
full
of
and
prussians
saxons
and
baverois
with
here
and
there
the
white
uniform
of
the
imperial
guard
suddenly
i
started
horribly
conscious
as
i
was
that
i
was
an
english
authoress
and
with
no
excuse
to
offer
for
my
presence
there
i
felt
distinctly
nervous
when
i
saw
a
queer
young
man
in
a
bulky
brown
coat
move
slowly
along
at
my
side
with
a
curious
sidling
movement
whispering
something
under
his
breath
i
was
not
sure
whether
to
hurry
on
or
to
stand
still
jean
chose
the
latter
course
whereupon
the
stranger
flicked
a
look
up
and
down
the
street
then
put
his
hand
in
his
inner
breast
pocket
he
whispered
hoarsely
flashing
looks
up
and
down
the
street
how
much
asked
jean
five
francs
he
answered
put
it
away
toute
suite
vous
savez
dangereux
then
quickly
he
added
walking
along
beside
us
still
and
speaking
still
in
that
hoarse
melodramatic
voice
which
pleased
him
a
little
i
could
help
thinking
les
allemands
will
give
me
a
year
in
prison
if
they
catch
me
so
i
have
to
make
it
pay
but
the
brussels
people
have
their
newspapers
they
got
to
know
the
truth
about
the
war
and
the
english
papers
tell
the
truth
how
do
you
get
the
newspapers
i
whispered
like
a
conspirator
myself
i
sneak
in
and
out
of
brussels
in
a
peasant
cart
all
the
way
to
sottegem
he
whispered
back
every
week
they
catch
one
of
us
but
still
we
go
on
we
do
know
what
fear
is
in
brussels
that
because
we
got
max
at
the
head
of
us
ah
there
a
man
for
you
m
max
a
look
of
pride
and
tenderness
flashed
across
his
dark
crafty
face
then
he
was
gone
and
i
found
myself
longing
for
the
morning
when
i
should
talk
with
max
myself
but
sunday
i
was
awakened
by
the
loud
booming
of
cannon
proceeding
from
the
direction
of
malines
what
is
happening
i
asked
the
maid
who
brought
my
coffee
is
that
firing
very
near
oui
madam
on
dit
that
in
a
few
days
now
the
belgian
army
will
brussels
and
the
germans
will
be
driven
out
that
will
be
splendid
madam
will
it
not
splendid
i
answered
mechanically
this
optimism
was
now
becoming
a
familiar
phrase
to
me
i
found
it
everywhere
but
alas
i
found
it
alongside
what
was
continually
being
revealed
as
pathetic
ignorance
of
the
true
state
of
affairs
and
the
nearer
one
was
to
actual
events
the
greater
appeared
ignorance
this
very
day
when
we
were
saying
in
a
few
days
now
the
germans
will
be
driven
out
of
brussels
they
were
commencing
their
colossal
attack
upon
antwerp
and
we
knew
nothing
about
it
the
faithful
jean
called
for
me
at
ten
and
hurrying
through
the
streets
to
meet
max
at
the
hotel
de
ville
we
became
suddenly
aware
that
something
extraordinary
was
happening
a
sense
of
agitation
was
in
the
air
people
were
hurrying
about
talking
quickly
and
angrily
and
then
our
eyes
were
confronted
by
the
following
startling
notice
pasted
on
the
walls
printed
in
german
french
and
flemish
and
flaming
over
brussels
in
all
directions
le

cries
of
grief
and
rage
kept
bursting
from
those
belgians
not
a
man
or
woman
in
the
city
was
there
who
did
not
worship
the
very
ground
max
walked
on
the
blow
was
sharp
and
terrible
it
was
utterly
unexpected
too
crowds
kept
on
gathering
presently
with
that
accompaniment
of
distant
cannon
the
anger
of
the
populace
found
vent
in
groans
and
hisses
as
a
body
of
uhlans
made
its
appearance
conducting
two
belgian
prisoners
towards
the
town
hall
and
then
all
in
a
moment
brussels
was
in
an
uproar
prudence
and
fear
were
flung
to
the
wind
like
mad
creatures
the
seething
crowds
of
men
women
and
children
went
tearing
along
towards
the
hotel
de
ville
groaning
and
hooting
at
every
german
they
saw
and
shouting
aloud
the
name
of
max
while
to
add
to
the
indescribable
tumult
hundreds
of
little
boys
ran
shrieking
at
the
tops
of
their
voices
le

the
civic
guard
composed
now
mostly
of
elderly
enrolled
brussels
civilians
dashed
in
and
out
among
the
infuriated
mob
waving
their
sticks
and
imploring
the
population
to
restrain
itself
or
the
consequences
might
be
fatal
for
one
and
all
meanwhile
the
aldermen
were
busy
preparing
a
new
which
was
soon
being
posted
up
in
all
directions

accompanied
by

i
hurried
on
to
the
hotel
de
ville
voyez
vous
says
jean
under
his
breath
voici
les
allemands
dans
de
ville
quel
chose
and
i
hear
a
sharp
note
in
the
poor
fellow
voice
that
told
of
bitter
emotion
it
was
an
ordeal
to
walk
through
that
beautiful
classic
courtyard
patrolled
by
german
sentinels
armed
to
the
teeth
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
pass
them
without
either
looking
or
not
looking
but
once
inside
i
felt
safer
the
germans
kept
to
their
side
of
the
town
hall
leaving
the
belgian
municipality
alone
we
went
up
the
wide
stairs
hung
with
magnificent
pictures
and
found
a
sad
group
of
belgians
gathered
in
a
long
corridor
the
windows
of
which
looked
down
into
the
courtyard
below
where
the
germans
were
unloading
waggons
or
striding
up
and
down
with
bayonets
fixed
looking
down
from
that
window
while
we
waited
to
be
received
by
le
meunier
the
who
had
promptly
taken
max
place
i
interested
myself
in
studying
the
famous
german
leg
a
greater
part
of
it
was
boot
these
boots
looked
as
though
immense
attention
had
been
given
to
them
in
fact
there
was
nothing
they
did
have
iron
heels
waterproof
uppers
patent
soles
an
immense
thickness
with
metal
intermingled
an
infinite
capacity
for
not
wearing
out
i
watched
these
giant
boots
standing
in
the
gateway
of
the
exquisite
hotel
de
ville
fair
monument
of
belgium
genius
for
the
gothic
i
could
see
nothing
of
the
upper
part
of
the
germans
only
their
legs
and
it
was
forced
upon
my
observation
that
those
legs
were
of
great
strength
and
massive
yet
with
a
curious
flinging
freedom
of
gait
that
was
the
direct
result
of
then
i
saw
two
officers
into
the
courtway
i
saw
their
feet
first
then
their
knees
the
effect
was
curious
they
appeared
to
kick
out
contemptuously
at
the
world
then
pranced
in
after
the
kick
the
conceit
of
the
performance
defies
all
words
then
jean
card
was
taken
into
the
acting
burgomaster
and
next
moment
a
belgian
échevin
said
to
us
entrez
vous
plaît
and
we
passed
into
the
room
habitually
occupied
by
max
we
found
ourselves
in
a
palatial
chamber
the
walls
covered
thickly
with
splendid
tapestries
and
portraits
from
the
high
gilded
ceiling
hung
enormous
chandeliers
glittering
and
pageantesque
under
one
of
these
giant
chandeliers
stood
an
imposing
desk
covered
with
papers
an
elderly
gentleman
with
a
grey
wide
beard
was
seated
there
we
advanced
over
the
thick
soft
carpets
le
meunier
received
us
with
great
courtesy
nous
avons
perdu
notre
tête
he
murmured
without
max
we
are
lost
the
air
was
full
of
agitation
here
was
a
scene
the
like
of
which
might
well
have
been
presented
by
the
stage
so
spectacular
was
it
so
dramatic
the
lofty
chamber
with
its
superb
appointments
and
hangings
and
these
elderly
men
of
state
who
had
just
been
dealt
the
bitterest
blow
that
had
yet
fallen
on
their
poor
tortured
shoulders
but
this
was
no
stage
scene
this
was
real
if
ever
anything
on
earth
was
alive
and
real
it
was
this
scene
in
the
burgomaster
room
in
brussels
on
the
first
day
of
max
imprisonment
throbbing
and
palpitating
through
it
was
human
agony
human
grief
human
despair
as
these
belgians
stared
with
dull
heavy
eyes
at
the
empty
space
where
their
heroic
chief
no
longer
was
tragic
beyond
the
words
of
any
historian
was
that
scene
which
at
last
however
by
sheer
intensity
of
concentrated
and
concealed
emotion
seemed
to
summon
again
into
that
chamber
the
imprisoned
body
the
blazing
dauntless
personality
of
the
absent
one
until
his
prison
bonds
were
broken
and
he
was
here
seated
at
this
desk
cool
fearless
imperturbable
directing
the
helm
of
his
bark
with
his
splendid
sanity
and
saying
to
all
fear
nothing
mes
enfants
there
is
no
such
thing
as
fear
chapter
xix
his
arrest
the
story
of
max
arrest
was
characteristic
he
was
busy
at
the
hotel
de
ville
with
his
colleagues
when
a
peremptory
message
arrived
from
von
der
goltz
bidding
him
come
at
once
to
an
interview
i
can
not
come
at
once
said
max
i
am
occupied
in
an
important
conference
with
my
colleagues
i
come
at
four
presently
the
messenger
returned
monsieur
max
will
you
come
at
once
he
said
in
a
worried
manner
von
der
goltz
is
angry
i
am
busy
with
my
work
replied
max
imperturbably
as
i
said
before
i
shall
be
with
von
der
goltz
at
at
he
went
off
accompanied
by
his
colleagues
and
a
dramatic
conference
took
place
between
the
germans
and
belgians
max
now
fearlessly
informed
the
germans
that
he
considered
it
would
be
unfair
for
brussels
to
pay
any
more
at
present
of
the
indemnity
put
upon
it
by
germany
one
reason
he
gave
was
very
simple
the
germans
had
posted
up
notices
in
the
city
declaring
that
in
future
they
would
not
pay
for
anything
required
for
the
service
of
the
german
army
but
would
take
whatever
they
wanted
free
you
must
wait
for
your
indemnity
said
max
you
ca
get
blood
from
a
stone
then
we
arrest
you
all
as
hostages
for
the
money
was
the
answer
at
first
max
and
all
his
échevins
were
arrested
two
hours
later
the
aldermen
were
released
but
not
max
he
was
sent
to
his
in
a
german
fortress
the
months
have
passed
he
is
still
there
chapter
xx
general
thys
by
degrees
brussels
calmed
down
but
the
germans
wore
startled
expressions
all
that
grey
wet
sunday
as
though
realising
that
within
that
city
was
a
terribly
dangerous
force
a
force
that
had
been
restrained
and
kept
in
order
all
this
time
by
the
very
man
they
had
been
foolish
enough
to
imprison
because
brussels
found
herself
unable
to
pay
up
her
millions
later
on
that
sunday
afternoon
i
fulfilled
my
promise
and
went
to
call
on
general
thys
the
father
of
one
of
my
aerschot
acquaintances
i
found
the
old
general
in
that
beautiful
house
of
his
in
the
chaussée
de
charleroi
sitting
by
the
fireside
in
his
library
reading
the
old
testament
the
only
book
i
can
read
now
the
general
said
in
a
voice
that
shook
a
little
as
if
with
some
burning
secret
agitation
i
remember
so
well
that
interview
it
was
a
grey
sunday
afternoon
with
a
touch
of
autumn
in
the
air
and
no
sunlight
through
the
great
glass
windows
at
the
end
of
the
library
i
could
see
that
brussels
garden
with
some
trees
green
and
some
turning
palely
gold
already
on
their
way
towards
decay
seated
on
one
side
of
the
fire
was
the
beautiful
young
unmarried
daughter
of
the
house
sharing
her
father
terrible
loneliness
while
on
the
other
side
sat
the
handsome
melancholy
old
belgian
hero
whose
trembling
voice
began
presently
to
tell
the
story
of
his
beloved
nation
its
suffering
its
heroism
its
love
of
home
its
bygone
struggles
for
liberty
and
outside
in
the
streets
germans
strode
up
and
down
germans
stood
on
the
steps
of
the
palais
de
justice
germans
everywhere
mademoiselle
thys
a
tall
fair
very
beautiful
young
girl
chats
away
brightly
trying
to
cheer
her
father
presently
she
talks
of
max
brussels
can
talk
of
nothing
else
she
shows
him
to
me
in
a
different
aspect
now
i
see
him
in
society
witty
delightful
charming
débonnaire
i
did
so
love
to
be
taken
into
dinner
by
m
max
exclaims
the
bright
young
belle
he
was
so
interesting
so
amusing
and
so
nice
to
flirt
with
he
did
not
dance
but
he
went
to
all
the
balls
and
walked
about
chatting
and
amusing
himself
and
everyone
else
before
one
big
fancy
dress
ball
it
was
the
last
in
brussels
before
the
war
max
announced
that
he
could
not
be
present
everyone
was
sorry
his
presence
always
made
things
brighter
livelier
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
the
ball
a
policeman
was
seen
coming
up
the
stairs
his
stick
in
his
hand
gravely
without
speaking
to
anyone
he
moved
down
the
corridors
police
whispered
everyone
can
it
mean
and
then
one
of
the
hosts
went
up
to
the
policeman
determined
to
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
as
you
say
in
angleterre
and
find
out
what
is
wrong
and
voilà
it
is
no
policeman
at
all
it
is
m
max
undoubtedly
the
hatred
and
terror
of
germany
at
this
time
was
all
for
russia
in
russia
germany
saw
her
deadliest
foe
every
belgian
man
or
woman
that
i
talked
with
in
brussels
asserted
the
same
thing
the
germans
are
terrified
of
russia
said
the
old
general
they
see
in
russia
the
greatest
enemy
to
their
plans
in
asia
minor
they
fear
russian
civilisation
or
so
they
say
civilisation
indeed
what
they
fear
is
russian
numbers
it
was
highly
interesting
to
observe
as
i
was
forced
to
do
a
little
later
how
completely
that
hatred
for
russia
was
passed
on
to
england
the
passing
on
occurred
english
troops
were
sent
to
the
assistance
of
antwerp
from
then
on
the
blaze
of
hatred
in
germany
heart
was
all
for
england
deepening
and
intensifying
with
extraordinary
ferocity
ever
since
october
and
why
the
reason
is
obvious
now
our
effort
to
save
antwerp
unsuccessful
as
it
was
yet
by
delaying
germans
enabled
those
highly
important
arrangements
to
be
carried
out
on
the
allies
western
front
that
frustrated
germany
hopes
in
france
and
stopped
her

how
max
has
influenced
brussels
in
their
attitude
to
the
germans
the
undoubtedly
take
their
tone
from
max
for
his
sake
they
suppressed
themselves
as
quickly
as
possible
that
famous
sunday
and
soon
went
on
their
usual
way
their
attitude
towards
the
germans
revealed
itself
as
a
truly
remarkable
one
it
was
perfect
in
every
sense
they
were
never
rude
never
sullen
never
afraid
and
until
this
particular
sunday
and
afterwards
again
they
always
behaved
as
though
the
germans
did
not
exist
at
all
they
walked
past
them
as
though
they
were
air
no
one
ever
speaks
to
the
huns
in
brussels
they
sit
there
alone
in
the
restaurants
or
in
groups
eating
eating
eating
hour
after
hour
they
sit
there
you
pass
at
seven
and
they
are
eating
and
drinking
you
pass
at
nine
they
are
still
eating
and
drinking
their
red
faces
grow
redder
and
redder
their
gold
wedding
rings
grow
tighter
and
tighter
on
their
fingers
the
belgians
wait
on
them
with
an
admirable
air
of
not
noticing
their
presence
never
looking
at
them
never
speaking
to
them
the
waiters
bringing
them
their
food
with
an
admirable
detached
air
as
though
they
are
placing
viands
before
a
set
of
invisible
spectres
always
alone
are
the
germans
in
brussels
and
sometimes
they
look
extremely
bored
i
ca
help
noticing
that
they
do
their
best
to
win
a
little
friendliness
from
the
belgians
but
in
vain
at
the
restaurants
they
always
pay
for
their
food
they
also
make
a
point
of
sometimes
ostentatiously
dropping
money
into
the
boxes
for
collecting
funds
for
the
belgians
but
the
never
for
one
moment
let
down
the
barriers
between
themselves
and
les
allemands
although
they
do
occasionally
allow
themselves
the
joy
of
getting
a
rise
out
of
the
landsturm
when
possible
an
amusement
which
the
germans
apparently
find
it
impolite
to
resent
i
sat
in
a
tram
in
brussels
when
two
germans
in
mufti
entered
and
quite
politely
excused
themselves
from
paying
their
fares
explaining
that
they
were
military
and
travel
free
but
how
do
i
know
that
you
are
really
german
soldiers
says
the
plucky
little
tram
guard
while
all
the
passengers
crane
forward
to
listen
you
not
in
uniform
i
do
know
who
you
are
you
must
pay
your
fares
messieurs
or
you
must
get
out
with
red
annoyed
faces
the
germans
pull
out
their
soldiers
medals
gaudy
ornate
affairs
on
blue
ribbons
round
their
necks
i
do
recognise
these
says
the
tram
guard
examining
them
solemnly
they
not
what
our
soldiers
carry
i
ca
let
you
go
free
on
these
but
we
have
no
money
splutter
the
germans
then
i
must
ask
you
to
get
out
says
the
guard
gravely
and
the
two
germans
looking
very
foolish
actually
get
out
of
the
tram
whereupon
the
passengers
all
burst
into
uncontrollable
laughter
which
gives
them
a
vast
amount
of
satisfaction
while
the
two
germans
very
red
in
the
face
march
away
down
the
street
as
for
the
street
urchins
they
flourish
under
the
german
occupation
adopting
exactly
the
same
attitude
towards
their
conquerors
as
that
manifested
by
their
elders
and
max
dressed
up
in
paper
uniforms
with
a
carrot
for
the
point
of
their
imitation
german
helmet
they
march
right
under
the
noses
of
the
germans
headed
by
an
old
dog
round
the
old
dog
neck
is
an
inscription
war
is
taking
place
for
the
aggrandisement
of
belgium
the
truth
is
the
beautiful
truth
that
the
spirit
of
max
hangs
over
brussels
steals
through
it
pervades
it
it
is
his
ego
that
possesses
the
town
it
is
max
who
is
really
in
occupation
there
it
is
max
who
is
the
true
conqueror
it
is
max
who
holds
brussels
and
will
hold
it
through
all
time
to
come
for
all
that
the
germans
are
going
about
the
streets
and
for
all
that
max
is
detained
in
his
honorable
fortress
the
man
spirit
is
so
indomitable
so
ardent
that
he
makes
himself
felt
through
his
prison
walls
and
the
population
of
brussels
is
able
to
say
with
magnificent
sangfroid
and
a
confidence
that
is
absolutely
real
they
may
keep
max
in
a
fortress
but
even
les
alboches
will
never
dare
to
hurt
a
hair
of
his
head
chapter
xxii
under
german
occupation
in
my
empty
hotel
the
profoundest
melancholy
reigns
the
inherent
sadness
of
the
occupied
city
seems
to
have
full
sway
here
the
palm
court
with
its
high
glassed
roof
is
swept
with
ghostly
echoes
especially
when
the
day
wanes
towards
dusk
the
great
deserted
with
its
polished
tables
and
its
rows
of
chairs
is
like
a
mausoleum
for
dead
revellers
the
with
their
desks
always
so
pitifully
tidy
the
the
the
floor
upon
floor
of
empty
guestless
bedrooms
with
the
beds
rolled
back
and
the
blinds
down
they
ache
with
their
ghastly
silences
and
seem
to
languish
away
towards
decay
the
only
servant
is
antoine
the
bent
little
old
faithful
porter
who
has
passed
his
lifetime
in
the
service
of
the
house
madame
la
patronne
in
heavy
mourning
with
her
two
small
boys
clinging
to
either
arm
sometimes
moves
across
the
palm
court
to
her
own
little
and
sometimes
some
belgian
woman
friend
always
in
black
drops
in
and
she
and
la
patronne
and
the
old
porter
all
talk
together
dully
guardedly
relating
to
each
other
the
gossip
of
brussels
and
wondering
always
how
things
are
going
with
les
petits
belges
outside
in
the
world
beyond
in
front
the
great
doors
are
locked
and
barred
one
tiny
door
cut
in
the
wooden
gate
at
the
side
is
one
sole
means
of
exit
and
entrance
but
it
is
almost
too
small
for
the
liège
professor
and
he
tells
me
plaintively
that
he
will
be
glad
to
move
on
to
liège
i
get
broken
to
pieces
squeezing
in
and
out
of
that
little
door
he
says
and
i
am
always
afraid
i
will
stick
in
the
middle
and
the
germans
in
the
restaurant
will
see
me
and
ask
who
i
am
and
what
i
am
doing
here
i
can
get
through
the
door
easily
enough
i
answer
but
i
suffer
agonies
as
i
stand
there
on
the
street
waiting
for
old
antoine
to
come
and
unlock
it
and
then
there
is
no
food
here
no
lunch
no
dinner
and
i
do
not
like
to
go
in
the
restaurants
alone
i
am
afraid
the
germans
will
notice
me
i
am
so
big
you
see
everybody
notices
me
do
you
think
i
will
ever
get
to
liège
of
course
you
will
but
do
you
think
i
will
ever
get
back
from
liège
to
antwerp
of
course
you
will
peur
moi
aussi
and
indeed
sitting
there
in
the
dusk
in
the
eerie
silences
of
the
deserted
hotel
with
the
german
guns
booming
away
in
the
distance
towards
malines
there
creeps
over
me
a
shuddering
sensation
that
is
very
like
fear
at
the
realization
of
what
belgium
has
suffered
and
may
have
to
suffer
yet
and
i
find
it
almost
intolerable
the
thought
of
this
poor
brave
old
trembling
belgian
weighted
with
years
and
flesh
struggling
so
manfully
to
get
back
to
liège
and
gauge
for
himself
the
extent
of
the
damage
done
to
his
house
and
properties
to
see
his
servants
and
help
them
make
arrangements
for
the
future
like
all
the
rest
of
the
belgian
fugitives
he
knows
nothing
about
the
destruction
of
his
town
it
may
be
that
his
home
has
been
razed
to
the
ground
it
may
be
that
it
has
been
spared
he
is
sure
of
nothing
and
that
is
why
he
has
set
out
on
this
long
and
dangerous
journey
which
is
not
by
any
means
over
yet
then
the
old
porter
approaches
gentle
sorrowful
monsieur
good
news
there
is
a
train
for
liège
morning
at
five
merci
bien
says
the
old
professor
mais
peur
i
rise
at
four
next
morning
and
come
down
to
see
him
off
we
two
who
have
never
seen
each
other
before
seem
now
like
the
only
relics
of
some
bygone
event
to
see
his
fat
old
enormous
face
gives
me
a
positive
thrill
of
joy
i
feel
as
if
i
have
known
him
all
my
life
and
when
he
has
gone
i
feel
curiously
alone
the
melancholy
old
fat
presence
had
lent
a
semblance
of
life
to
the
hotel
which
how
seems
given
over
to
ghosts
and
echoes
unable
to
bear
it
i
moved
into
the
métropole
it
was
very
strange
to
be
there
very
strange
indeed
this
was
the
métropole
and
yet
not
the
métropole
sometimes
i
could
not
believe
it
was
the
métropole
at
all
the
gay
bright
lively
friendly
companionable
métropole
so
sad
was
this
big
hotel
so
full
of
gloomy
echoing
silences
and
with
never
a
soul
to
arrive
or
leave
to
ask
for
a
room
or
a
there
were
italians
in
charge
of
the
hotel
for
which
i
was
profoundly
thankful
how
nice
they
were
to
me
those
kindly
sons
of
the
south
they
allowed
me
to
look
in
their
visitors
book
and
as
i
expected
i
found
that
the
dry
hotel
register
had
suddenly
become
transformed
into
a
vital
human
document
of
surpassing
interest
of
intense
historic
value
as
i
glanced
through
the
crowded
pages
i
came
at
last
upon
an
ominous
date
in
august
upon
which
there
were
no
names
entered
it
was
the
day
on
which
brussels
surrendered
to
the
germans
on
that
day
the
register
was
blank
entirely
blank
and
next
day
also
and
the
next
and
the
next
and
the
next
were
those
white
empty
sheets
with
never
a
name
inscribed
upon
them
for
weeks
this
blankness
continued
it
was
stifling
in
its
significance
it
clutched
at
one
it
shouted
aloud
of
the
agony
of
those
days
when
all
who
could
do
so
left
brussels
and
only
those
who
were
obliged
to
remained
it
told
its
desolate
tale
of
the
visitors
that
had
fled
or
ceased
to
come
only
here
and
there
after
a
long
interval
appeared
a
german
name
or
two
frau
schmidt
arrived
herr
lemberg
fräulein
gottmituns
there
was
a
subdued
little
group
of
occupants
when
i
was
there
morse
the
american
williams
another
american
an
minister
and
his
wife
and
son
exiles
these
from
portugal
a
little
dutch
baroness
who
was
said
to
be
a
great
friend
of
gyp
half
a
dozen
english
nurses
and
two
wounded
german
officers
i
made
friends
quickly
with
the
nurses
and
the
americans
and
to
look
into
english
eyes
again
gave
me
a
peculiarly
soothing
sense
of
relief
that
taught
me
if
i
needed
teaching
how
alone
i
was
in
all
these
dangers
and
agitations
williams
had
a
queer
experience
i
have
often
wondered
why
america
did
not
resent
it
on
his
account
he
was
arrested
and
taken
prisoner
for
talking
about
the
horrors
of
louvain
in
a
train
he
was
released
while
i
was
there
i
saw
him
dashing
into
the
hotel
one
evening
a
brown
paper
parcel
under
his
arm
there
was
quite
a
little
scene
in
the
everyone
came
round
him
asking
what
had
happened
it
seemed
that
as
he
stepped
out
of
the
tram
he
was
confronted
by
german
officers
who
promptly
conducted
him
into
a
detention
honorable
there
he
was
stripped
and
searched
and
in
the
meanwhile
private
detectives
visited
his
room
at
the
métropole
and
went
through
all
his
belongings
nothing
of
a
compromising
nature
being
found
williams
was
allowed
to
go
free
after
hours
having
first
to
give
his
word
that
in
future
he
would
not
express
himself
in
public
when
i
invited
him
to
describe
to
me
what
happened
in
his
detention
honorable
he
answered
with
a
strained
smile
no
more
talking
for
me
surely
this
insult
to
a
american
must
have
been
a
bitter
dose
for
the
american
consulate
to
swallow
but
perhaps
they
were
too
busy
to
notice
it
when
i
called
at
the
consulate
the
place
was
crowded
with
english
nurses
begging
to
be
helped
away
from
brussels
i
found
that
richards
had
already
put
in
a
word
on
my
behalf
this
is
what
they
gave
me
at
the
american
consulate
in
brussels
as
a
safeguard
against
the
germans
i
should
have
cared
to
show
it
to
the
enemy
it
seemed
to
me
to
deliver
me
straight
into
their
hands
i
hid
it
in
the
lining
of
my
hat
with
my
passport
illustration

american
safeguard

the

the
spectacle
of

and
posing
on

so
ill
did
they
fit
the
beauty
of

that
all

in

writhed
with
pain
like
some
horrible
vandal
attempt
at
decoration
upon
pure
and
flawless
architecture
these
coarse
brutish
figures
stood
with
legs
apart
their
flat
round
caps
upon
their
solemn
yokel
faces
giving
them
the
aspect
of
a
body
of
convicts

pillars

put
up

hung
their

there
while
a
bucket
stood
in

middle
of
the
beautiful
tesselated
floor
and
then
in
exquisite
taste
to
give
the
belgians
a
treat
this
interior
has
been
photographed
and
forced
into
an
extraordinary
little
newspaper
published
in
brussels
printed
in
french
but
secretly
controlled
by
the
germans
who
splatter
it
with
their
photographs
in
every
conceivable
and
inconceivable
style
and
so
we
see
them
in
their
kitchen
installed
at
the
foot
of
the
monument
wearing
aprons
over
their
tummies
blucher
boots
and
round
flat
caps
a
pretty
picture

they
posed
themselves
for
it

did
it
and
this
is
how
they
tipped
up
a
big
basket
and
let
it
lie
in
the
foreground
on
its
side
two
germans
seized
a
table
lifting
it
off
the
ground
one
man
seated
himself
on
a
wooden
bench
with
a
tin
of
kerosene
half
a
dozen
others
leaned
up
against
the
portable
stoves
with
folded
arms
looking
as
if
they
were
going
to
burst
into
moody
and
sankey
hymns
all
food
all
bottles
were
hidden
the
dustbin
was
brought
forward
instead
and
then
the
photographer
said
gut
and
there
they
were
it
was
the
hunnish
idea
of
a
superb
photograph
of
army
cooks
contrast
it
with
tommy
how
do
you
see
tommy
when
a
war
photographer
gets
him
his
first
thought
is
for
an
effect
of
he
does
hide
bottles
and
glasses
he
brings
them
out
and
lets
you
look
at
them
he
does
in
the
act
of
being
photographed
lift
a
table
he
lifts
a
or
a
bottle
if
he
has
one
handy
give
us
tommy
all
the
time
yes
all
the
time
another
photograph
shews
the
huns
in
the
auditoire
of
the
cour
de
cassation
more
funny
effects
they
brought
forward
all
their
and
piled
them
on
a
desk
for
decoration
they
themselves
lie
on
the
carpeted
steps
at
full
length
but
they
do
lounge
they
ca
no
man
can
lounge
who
does
know
what
to
do
with
his
hands
and
germans
never
know
what
to
do
with
theirs
when
i
saw
that
picture
showing
the
hun
idea
of
how
a
photograph
should
be
taken
i
felt
a
suffocation
in
my
larynx
then
there
was
a
gem
called
un
coin
de
la
cour
de
cassation
this
shewed
dried
fish
and
sausages
hanging
on
an
easel
cheeses
on
the
floor
and
washing
on
the
and
opposite
this
on
the

was
a
photo
of
general

his

death
in
life
what
is
it
i
been
saying
about
gaiety
how
could
one
ever
use
such
a
word
here
in
the
heart
of
brussels
one
can
not
recall
even
a
memory
of
what
it
was
like
to
be
joyful
i
am
in
a
city
under
german
occupation
and
i
see
around
me
death
in
life
and
life
in
death
i
see
men
women
and
children
with
eyes
that
are
looking
into
tombs
oh
those
eyes
those
eyes
ah
here
is
the
agony
of
belgium
here
in
this
fair
white
capital
set
like
a
snowflake
on
her
hillside
here
is
grief
concentrated
and
dread
accumulated
and
the
days
go
by
and
the
weeks
come
and
pass
and
then
months
and
still
the
agony
endures
the
germans
remain
the
belgians
wake
to
fresh
morrows
with
that
weight
that
is
more
bitter
and
heavier
than
death
flinging
itself
upon
their
weary
shoulders
the
moment
they
return
to
consciousness
yes
waking
in
brussels
is
grim
as
waking
on
the
morn
of
execution
out
of
sleep
with
its
mercy
of
dream
and
forgetfulness
the
comes
back
each
morning
to
a
sense
of
brooding
tragedy
swiftly
this
deepens
into
realization
the
germans
are
here
they
are
still
here
the
day
must
be
gone
through
the
sad
long
day
there
is
no
escaping
it
the
belgian
must
see
the
grey
figures
striding
through
his
beloved
streets
shopping
in
his
shops
walking
and
motoring
in
his
parks
and
squares
he
must
meet
the
murderers
in
his
churches
in
his
cafés
he
must
hear
their
laughter
in
his
ears
and
their
loud
arrogant
speech
he
must
see
them
in
possession
of
his
post
offices
his
banks
his
museums
his
libraries
his
theatres
his
palaces
his
hotels
he
must
remain
in
ignorance
of
the
world
outside
worst
of
all
when
his
poor
tortured
thoughts
turn
to
one
thought
of
his
deliverance
he
must
confront
a
terror
sharper
than
all
the
rest
then
he
sees
in
clear
vision
the
ghastly
fate
that
may
fall
upon
the
unarmed
brussels
population
the
day
the
germans
are
driven
out
the
whole
beautiful
city
may
be
in
flames
the
whole
population
murdered
there
is
no
one
who
can
stop
the
germans
if
they
decide
to
ruin
brussels
before
evacuating
it
one
can
only
trust
in
their
and
their
mercy
and
at
thought
of
mercy
the
gazes
away
down
the
flat
dusty
road
away
towards
louvain
the
peasants
are
going
backwards
and
forwards
to
louvain
little
carts
filled
with
beshawled
women
and
children
keep
trundling
along
the
road
a
rickety
waggonette
is
drawn
up
in
front
of
a
café
louvain
is
marked
on
it
in
white
chalk
on
a
black
board
in
the
café
window
is
a
notice
that
the
waggonette
will
start
when
full
the
day
is
desperately
wet
there
is
a
canvas
roof
to
the
waggonette
but
the
rain
dashes
through
sideways
and
backwards
and
forwards
under
cover
of
the
rain
as
it
were
i
step
into
the
waggonette
and
seat
myself
quietly
among
a
group
of
peasants
two
more
get
in
shortly
after
then
off
we
start
in
silence
all
crouching
together
we
drive
through
the
city
out
through
the
northern
gateway
soon
we
are
galloping
along
the
drear
flat
that
leads
to
the
greatest
tragedy
of
the
war
it
is
ten
when
we
start
at
eleven
we
are
in
louvain
on
the
way
we
meet
only
peasants
and
little
going
to
and
from
brussels
over
the
flat
bare
country
through
the
grey
atmosphere
comes
an
impression
of
whiteness
my
heart
beats
suffocatingly
as
i
climb
out
of
the
waggonette
and
stand
in
the
narrow
rue
de
la
station
looking
along
the
the
heaps
of
débris
nearly
meet
across
the
street
the
rain
is
falling
in
louvain
it
beats
through
the
ruined
spaces
it
does
its
best
to
wash
out
the
of
those
terrific
days
in
august
and
the
people
oh
the
brave
people
they
are
actually
making
a
pretence
of
life
a
few
shops
are
opened
a
café
opposite
the
ruined
theatre
is
full
of
pale
trembling
old
men
sipping
their
byrrh
or
coffee
louvain
is
just
alive
enough
to
whisper
the
word
but
with
that
word
it
whispers
also
immortality
in
its
ruin
louvain
seems
to
me
to
have
taken
on
a
beauty
that
could
never
have
belonged
to
it
in
other
days
those
great
fair
buildings
with
gaps
in
their
sides
speak
now
with
a
voice
that
the
whole
world
listens
to
the
germans
have
smashed
and
flattened
them
burnt
and
destroyed
them
but
the
glory
of
immortality
that
death
alone
can
confer
rests
upon
them
now
out
of
those
ruins
has
sprung
the
strongest
factor
in
the
war
louvain
despoiled
and
desolate
has
had
given
into
her
keeping
the
greatest
power
at
work
against
germany
louvain
in
her
waste
and
mourning
has
caused
the
world
to
pause
and
think
she
has
made
hearts
bleed
that
were
cold
before
she
has
opened
the
world
eyes
to
germany
brutality
actually
in
africa
louvain
it
was
that
decided
a
terribly
critical
situation
because
of
louvain
many
many
hesitating
partisans
of
germany
threw
in
their
cause
with
the
allies
ah
louvain
take
heart
in
your
destruction
you
are
indestructible
you
faced
your
day
of
carnage
your
civilians
bravely
opposed
the
enemy
it
was
all
written
down
in
destiny
white
book
the
priests
that
were
shot
in
your
streets
the
innocent
women
and
children
who
were
butchered
they
have
all
achieved
great
things
for
belgium
and
they
will
achieve
still
greater
things
yet
louvain
proud
glorious
louvain
it
is
because
of
you
that
germany
can
never
win
your
ruins
stand
for
germany
destruction
it
is
not
you
who
are
ruined
it
is
germany
i
wander
about
i
am
utterly
indifferent
if
a
german
officer
took
it
in
his
head
to
suspect
me
i
would
not
care
such
is
my
state
of
mind
wandering
among
the
ruins
of
louvain
i
am
surprised
to
find
that
in
the
actual
matter
of
ruins
louvain
is
less
destroyed
than
i
expected
compared
with
aerschot
the
town
has
not
been
as
ruthlessly
destroyed
aerschot
no
longer
exists
louvain
is
still
here
among
the
ruined
monuments
houses
and
shops
are
occupied
an
attempt
at
business
goes
on
the
heaps
of
masonry
in
the
streets
are
being
cleared
away
with
her
interior
torn
out
the
old
theatre
still
stands
upright
the
train
runs
in
and
out
among
the
ruins
the
university
is
like
a
beautiful
skeleton
with
the
wind
and
rain
dashing
through
the
interstices
between
her
white
frail
bones
where
there
are
walls
intact
and
even
over
the
ruins
the
germans
have
pasted
their
proclamations
veuve
for
insulting
an
official
was
sentenced
to
ten
years
in
prison
jean
for
opposing
an
official
was
shot
and
in
flaunting
placards
the
germans
beg
the
citizens
of
louvain
to
understand
that
they
will
meet
with
nothing
but
kindness
and
consideration
from
das
deutsche
heer
as
long
as
they
behave
themselves
i
step
into
a
little
shop
as
a
motor
car
full
of
german
officers
dashes
by
how
brave
you
are
to
keep
on
i
say
to
the
little
old
woman
behind
the
counter
it
must
be
terribly
sad
and
difficult
if
we
had
more
salt
she
says
we
should
mind
but
one
must
have
salt
and
there
is
none
left
in
louvain
we
go
to
brussels
for
it
but
it
grows
more
and
more
difficult
to
obtain
even
there
and
food
oh
the
english
will
never
let
us
starve
she
says
mon
mari
he
says
so
and
he
knows
he
was
in
england
forty
years
ago
he
was
in
the
household
of
baron
the
belgian
ambassador
in
london
would
you
like
to
see
mon
mari
i
went
into
the
room
behind
the
shop
mon
mari
was
sitting
in
a
big
chair
by
the
window
looking
out
over
some
purple
cabbages
he
was
a
little
old
belgian
shrivelled
and
trembling
he
had
been
shot
in
the
thigh
on
that
appalling
august
day
when
louvain
attempted
to
defend
herself
against
the
murderers
he
was
lame
broken
useless
aged
but
his
sense
of
humour
survived
it
flamed
up
till
i
felt
a
red
glow
in
that
chilly
room
looking
over
the
cabbages
and
laughter
warmed
us
all
three
among
the
ruins
myself
and
the
little
old
woman
and
mon
mari
yesterday
he
said
an
american
consul
was
coming
in
my
shop
he
was
walking
with
a
german
colonel
the
american
says
could
you
germans
destroy
a
beautiful
city
like
louvain
and
the
alboche
answered
did
know
it
was
beautiful
and
the
old
woman
echoes
ponderingly
know
it
was
beautiful

the
return
from
brussels
from
brussels
to
ninove
from
ninove
to
sottegem
from
sottegem
to
ghent
from
ghent
to
antwerp
that
was
how
i
got
back
at
the
outskirts
of
brussels
on
a
certain
windy
corner
i
stood
waiting
my
chance
of
a
vehicle
going
towards
ghent
the
were
still
cut
and
the
only
way
of
getting
out
of
brussels
was
to
drive
unless
one
went
on
foot
at
the
windy
corner
accompanied
by
jean
and
his
two
sisters
i
stood
watching
a
wonderful
drama
there
were
people
creeping
in
as
well
as
creeping
out
peasants
on
foot
women
and
children
who
had
fled
in
terror
and
were
now
returning
to
their
little
homes
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
the
germans
must
purposely
have
left
this
corner
unwatched
unhindered
probably
in
the
hope
of
getting
more
and
more
to
return
little
carts
and
big
carts
clattered
up
and
came
to
a
standstill
alongside
an
old
white
inn
and
jean
bargained
and
argued
on
my
behalf
for
a
seat
there
was
one
tiny
cart
drawn
by
a
donkey
with
five
young
men
in
it
the
driver
wanted
six
passengers
and
began
appealing
to
me
in
flemish
to
come
in
i
will
drive
you
all
the
way
to
ghent
if
you
like
he
said
how
much
ten
francs
suddenly
a
hand
pulled
at
my
sleeve
and
a
hoarse
voice
whispered
in
my
ear
non
non
madam
you
must
go
with
them
do
you
know
who
they
are
it
was
a
little
peasant
and
his
blue
eyes
were
full
of
distress
i
felt
startled
and
impressed
and
wondered
if
the
five
young
men
were
murderers
they
are
the
newspaper
sellers
muttered
the
peasant
under
his
breath
if
he
had
said
they
were
madmen
his
tone
could
not
have
been
more
awestruck
after
a
while
i
found
a
little
cart
with
two
seats
facing
each
other
two
hard
wooden
seats
one
bony
horse
stood
in
the
shafts
but
i
liked
the
look
of
the
three
belgian
women
who
were
getting
in
and
one
of
them
had
a
wee
baby
that
decided
me
i
felt
that
the
terrors
of
the
long
drive
before
me
would
be
curiously
lightened
by
that
baby
presence
its
very
tininess
seemed
to
make
things
easier
its
little
indifferent
sleeping
face
soft
and
calm
and
fragrant
among
its
white
wool
dainties
seemed
to
give
the
lie
to
dread
and
terror
seemed
to
hearten
one
swiftly
and
sweetly
seemed
to
say
look
at
me
i
only
a
month
old
but
i
not
frightened
of
anything
and
now
i
must
say
to
jean
and
to
his
two
plump
young
sisters
they
are
the
dearest
friends
i
have
in
the
world
or
so
it
seems
to
me
as
i
bid
them
bonne
chance
madam
they
whisper
i
should
like
to
have
kissed
jean
but
i
kissed
the
sisters
instead
then
feeling
as
if
i
were
being
cut
in
halves
i
climbed
lonely
and
full
of
sinister
dread
into
the
little
cart
and
the
driver
cracked
his
whip
shouting
allons
fritz
to
his
bony
horse
and
off
we
started
a
party
of
eight
all
told
the
three
belgian
women
sat
opposite
me
two
men
were
beside
me
and
the
driver
and
another
man
were
on
the
front
seat
hour
after
hour
we
drove
hour
after
hour
there
was
no
sun
the
land
looked
flat
and
melancholy
under
this
grey
sky
and
we
were
at
our
old
game
now
have
you
seen
the
germans
yes
yes
the
germans
are
there
pointing
to
the
right
and
we
would
turn
to
the
left
tacking
like
a
boat
in
the
storm
terrific
firing
was
going
on
but
the
baby
whose
name
the
mother
told
me
was
solange
slept
profoundly
the
three
women
chattered
like
parrots
and
the
driver
shouted
incessantly
allons
fritz
and

one
bleak
december
day
in
london
there
came
to
me
this
letter
and
by
it
alone
i
know
that
fritz
and
the
baby
solange
and
the
eight
of
us
are
no
myth
no
figment
of
my
imagination
we
really
did
all
together
drive
all
day
long
through
the
country
to
east
to
west
to
north
to
south
through
fields
and
byways
and
strange
little
villages
over
hills
and
along
valleys
with
the
cannon
always
booming
the
baby
always
sleeping
and
old
fritz
always
going
merry
and
bright
by
noon
we
might
have
known
each
other
a
thousand
years
i
had
the
baby
on
my
knee
the
three
men
cracked
walnuts
for
us
all
and
everyone
talked
at
once
strange
talk
the
strangest
in
all
the
world
so
they
killed
the
priest
she
hid
for
two
days
in
the
she
does
know
what
has
happened
to
her
five
children
they
were
stood
in
a
row
and
every
third
one
was
they
found
his
body
in
the
garden
il
est
ruiné
then
suddenly
one
of
the
ladies
who
knew
a
little
english
said
with
a
friendly
smile
i
have
liked
very
much
the
english
novel
how
do
you
call
it
something
about
a
lamp
everyone
reads
it
it
is
our
favourite
english
book
it
is
splendid
we
read
it
in
french
too
and
every
now
and
then
for
hours
she
and
i
would
try
guessing
the
name
of
that
book
but
we
never
got
it
it
was
weeks
later
when
i
remembered
the
lamplighter
at
last
we
crossed
the
border
from
brabant
into
flanders
and
galloping
up
a
long
hill
we
found
ourselves
in
ninove
it
was
in
a
terrific
state
of
excitement
here
we
saw
the
results
of
the
fighting
i
had
heard
at
enghien
on
the
saturday
the
germans
had
pillaged
and
destroyed
houses
lay
tumbled
on
the
streets
the
peasants
stood
grouped
in
terror
the
air
was
full
of
the
smell
of
burning
at
a
house
where
we
bought
some
apples
we
saw
a
after
the
huns
had
finished
it
every
bit
of
glass
and
china
in
the
room
was
smashed
tumblers
jugs
plates
cups
saucers
lay
in
heaps
all
over
the
floor
all
the
pictures
were
cut
from
the
frames
all
the
chairs
and
tables
were
broken
to
bits
the
cushions
were
torn
open
the
bookshelves
toppled
forward
the
books
lay
dripping
wet
on
the
grey
carpet
as
if
buckets
of
water
had
been
poured
over
them
jam
tins
sardine
tins
rubbish
and
filth
were
all
over
the
carpet
and
bottles
were
everywhere
it
was
a
low
degrading
sight
chapter
xxvii
the
english
are
coming
i
am
back
in
antwerp
and
the
unexpected
has
happened
we
are
besieged
the
siege
began
on
thursday
the
mental
excitement
of
these
last
days
passes
all
description
and
yet
antwerp
is
calm
outwardly
and
but
for
the
crowds
of
peasants
pouring
into
the
city
with
their
cows
and
their
bundles
one
would
hardly
know
that
the
germans
were
really
attacking
us
at
last
the
government
has
issued
an
order
that
anyone
who
likes
may
leave
antwerp
but
once
having
done
so
no
one
will
be
permitted
to
return
and
that
quite
decides
us
we
will
remain
all
day
long
the
cannon
are
booming
and
pounding
sometimes
they
sound
so
near
that
one
imagines
a
shell
must
have
burst
in
antwerp
itself
and
sometimes
they
grow
fainter
they
are
obviously
receding
or
so
we
tell
ourselves
hopefully
we
are
always
hopeful
we
are
always
telling
each
other
that
things
are
going
better
everyone
is
talking
talking
talking
everyone
is
asking
what
do
you
think
have
you
heard
any
news
everyone
is
saying
but
of
course
it
will
be
all
right
the
germans
have
been
driven
back
five
kilometres
says
one
civilian
have
you
heard
the
news
the
germans
have
been
driven
back
six
kilometres
says
another
and
again
have
heard
the
good
news
germans
driven
back
seven
kilometres
and
at
last
a
curious
mental
condition
sets
in
we
lose
interest
in
the
cannon
and
we
go
about
our
business
just
as
if
those
noises
were
not
ringing
in
our
ears
even
as
we
sit
at
dinner
in
our
hotel
there
is
one
little
notice
pasted
up
about
the
hotel
that
simply
as
it
reads
fills
one
with
a
new
and
more
active
terror
than
a
pas
this
is
because
the
german
shells
have
smashed
the
waterworks
at
wavre
catherine
and
so
in
the
meantime
antwerp
hotels
are
flooded
with
carbolic
and
we
drink
only
mineral
waters
and
wait
hopeful
as
ever
for
the
great
day
when
the
bathrooms
will
be
opened
again
these
nights
are
stiflingly
hot
and
the
mosquitoes
still
linger
indeed
they
are
so
bad
sometimes
that
i
put
eucalyptus
oil
on
my
pillow
to
keep
them
away
how
strange
that
all
this
terrific
firing
should
not
have
frightened
them
off
i
come
to
the
conclusion
that
mosquitoes
are
deaf
the
curious
thing
is
no
one
can
tell
by
looking
at
antwerp
that
she
is
going
through
the
greatest
page
in
all
her
varied
history
her
shops
are
open
people
sit
at
crowded
cafés
sipping
their
coffee
or
beer
a
magnificent
calm
prevails
there
is
no
sense
of
active
danger
the
lights
go
out
at
seven
instead
of
eight
by
ten
the
city
is
asleep
save
for
the
coming
and
going
of
clattering
troops
over
the
streets
and
avenues
grapes
and
pears
and
peaches
are
displayed
in
luxuriant
profusion
at
extraordinarily
low
prices
fish
and
meat
are
dearer
but
chickens
are
still
very
cheap
the
still
take
as
much
trouble
over
their
cooking
which
is
uncommonly
good
even
for
belgium
and
then
on
saturday
with
the
sharpness
and
suddenness
of
lightning
the
terrible
rumour
goes
round
that
antwerp
is
going
to
yes
surrender
rather
than
run
the
risk
of
being
destroyed
like
louvain
and
termonde
and
aerschot
the
legation
has
received
orders
that
the
government
is
about
to
be
moved
to
ostend
crowds
of
people
begin
to
hurry
out
of
antwerp
in
motor
cars
until
the
city
looks
somewhat
like
london
on
a
sunday
afternoon
and
full
of
bare
spaces
instead
of
crowded
and
animated
as
antwerp
has
been
ever
since
the
government
moved
here
from
brussels
and
then
on
sunday
comes
a
change
the
news
spreads
like
that
the
legations
have
had
their
orders
countermanded
early
in
the
morning
they
are
to
wait
further
instructions
something
has
happened
english
are
coming
chapter
xxviii
monday
a
golden
laughing
day
is
this
of
october
as
i
fly
along
in
my
car
i
soon
sense
a
new
current
vivid
and
electric
flowing
along
with
the
stream
of
belgian
life
oh
the
change
in
the
sad
belgian
officers
and
men
they
felt
that
help
was
coming
at
last
all
this
time
they
had
fought
alone
unaided
there
was
no
one
who
could
come
to
them
no
one
free
to
help
them
and
the
weeks
passed
into
months
and
liège
and
louvain
and
brussels
and
aerschot
and
namur
and
malines
and
termonde
have
all
fallen
one
by
one
and
high
hopes
have
been
blighted
and
the
enemy
in
its
terrific
strength
has
swept
on
and
on
held
back
continually
by
the
ardour
and
valour
of
the
little
belgian
army
which
is
still
indomitable
at
heart
but
tired
very
tired
haggard
exhausted
craving
the
rest
they
may
not
have
these
glorious
heroes
revive
as
if
by
magic
under
the
knowledge
that
other
troops
are
coming
to
help
theirs
in
this
gargantuan
struggle
for
antwerp
the
yellow
khaki
seems
to
sweep
along
with
the
blue
uniforms
like
sunlight
but
the
english
are
humble
and
modest
enough
god
knows
it
the
shells
that
we
mind
most
says
a
belgian
lieutenant
to
an
english
tommy
we
mind
them
too
says
tommy
humbly
we
ai
seen
them
yet
at
the
war
office
count
chabeau
has
given
me
a
special
permit
to
go
to
lierre
out
past
mortsell
i
notice
a
belgian
lady
standing
among
a
crowd
of
soldiers
she
wears
black
her
dress
is
elegant
yet
simple
i
admire
her
furs
and
i
wonder
what
on
earth
she
is
doing
here
right
out
in
the
middle
of
the
fortifications
far
from
the
city
belgian
ladies
are
seldom
seen
in
these
specified
zones
suddenly
her
eyes
meet
mine
and
she
comes
towards
me
drawn
by
the
knowledge
that
we
are
both
women
she
leans
in
at
my
car
window
and
then
she
tells
me
her
story
and
i
learn
why
she
looks
so
pale
and
worried
just
down
the
road
a
little
further
on
in
the
region
in
which
we
may
not
pass
is
her
villa
which
has
been
suddenly
requisitioned
by
the
english
all
in
a
hurry
yesterday
madame
packed
up
and
hurried
away
to
antwerp
to
arrange
for
her
stay
there
this
morning
she
has
returned
to
fetch
her
dogs
but
voilà
she
reaches
this
point
and
is
stopped
the
way
is
blocked
she
must
not
go
on
no
one
can
pass
without
a
special
which
she
has
got
illustration
a
special
permit
so
here
hour
after
hour
since
six
in
the
morning
she
stands
waiting
pitifully
for
a
chance
to
get
back
to
her
villa
and
take
away
her
dogs
that
she
fears
may
be
starving
mes
pauvre
chiens
she
keeps
exclaiming
and
now
a
motor
car
approaches
from
the
direction
of
lierre
with
an
english
officer
sitting
beside
the
chauffeur
i
tell
him
the
story
of
the
dogs
and
ask
what
can
be
done
the
officer
does
not
reply
he
almost
looks
as
if
he
has
not
heard
his
calm
cool
face
shows
little
sign
of
anything
at
all
he
merely
turns
his
car
round
and
flashes
away
along
the
white
and
road
that
he
has
just
traversed
ten
minutes
go
by
then
another
ten
then
back
along
the
road
flashes
the
grey
car
and
there
again
is
colonel
farquharson
cool
calm
and
unperturbed
and
behind
him
in
the
car
barking
joyfully
at
the
sight
of
their
mistress
are
three
big
dogs
mais
comme
les
anglais
sont
gentils
say
the
belgian
soldiers
along
the
road
out
of
the
burning
town
of
lierre
that
same
day
a
canary
and
a
grey
congo
parrot
are
tenderly
handed
over
to
my
care
by
a
couple
of
english
tommies
who
have
found
them
in
a
burning
house
the
canary
is
in
a
little
red
cage
and
the
tommies
have
managed
to
put
in
some
lumps
of
sugar
the
poor
little
thing
is
starving
says
a
tommy
compassionately
it
be
better
with
you
i
bring
the
birds
back
in
my
car
to
antwerp
but
the
parrot
is
very
frightened
he
will
not
eat
he
will
not
drink
he
looks
as
if
he
is
going
to
die
until
i
ask
cherry
kearton
to
come
and
see
him
and
then
voilà
the
famous
english
naturalist
bends
over
him
talks
pets
him
and
in
a
few
minutes
coco
is
busy
trimming
cherry
kearton
moustache
with
his
little
black
beak
and
from
that
very
moment
the
bird
begins
to
recover
as
i
write
the
parrot
and
canary
sit
here
on
my
table
the
parrot
perching
on
the
canary
cage
the
boom
of
cannon
is
growing
fainter
and
fainter
as
the
germans
appear
to
be
pushed
further
and
further
back
the
canary
is
singing
and
the
grey
parrot
is
cracking
nuts
and
i
think
of
the
man
who
rescued
them
and
hope
that
all
goes
well
with
him
who
with
death
staring
him
in
the
face
had
time
and
thought
to
save
the
lives
of
a
couple
of
birds
his
name
he
told
me
was
sergeant
thomas
marshall
of
winston
marines
he
said
if
you
see
my
wife
ever
you
can
tell
her
you
met
me
chapter
xxix
tuesday
it
is
tuesday
now
at
seven
in
the
morning
old
maria
knocks
at
my
door
good
news
madame
malines
has
been
retaken
that
is
cheering
and
old
maria
and
myself
like
everyone
else
are
eager
to
believe
the
best
the
grey
day
however
is
indescribably
sombre
from
a
high
grassy
terrace
at
the
top
of
the
hotel
i
look
out
across
the
city
towards
the
points
where
the
germans
are
attacking
us
great
black
clouds
that
yet
are
full
of
garish
light
float
across
the
city
and
through
the
clouds
one
two
three
four
aeroplanes
can
be
seen
black
as
birds
and
moving
continually
hither
and
thither
while
far
below
the
old
town
lies
with
its
towers
and
gilded
gothic
beauty
and
its
dark
red
roofs
and
its
wide
river
running
to
meet
the
sea
i
go
down
to
the
war
office
and
see
commandant
chabeau
he
looks
pale
and
haggard
his
handsome
grey
eyes
are
full
of
infinite
sadness
it
would
be
wiser
madame
that
you
do
go
out
of
the
city
he
says
in
his
gentle
chivalrous
voice
trop
dangereux
i
want
to
ask
him
a
thousand
questions
i
ask
him
nothing
i
go
away
back
to
the
hotel
one
and
we
learn
that
the
fighting
outside
is
terribly
hot
two
cars
come
flying
in
they
tell
us
that
shells
are
falling
about
five
miles
out
on
vieux
dieux
three
a
man
rushes
in
and
says
that
all
is
over
the
last
train
leaves
antwerp
the
government
is
going
it
is
our
last
chance
to
escape
how
far
is
holland
asks
someone
about
half
an
hour
away
he
answers
i
listen
dreamily
holland
sounds
very
near
i
wonder
what
i
am
going
to
do
am
i
going
to
stay
and
see
the
germans
enter
but
maybe
they
will
never
enter
the
unexpected
will
happen
we
shall
be
saved
at
the
eleventh
hour
it
is
impossible
that
antwerp
can
fall
they
will
be
shelling
the
town
before
hours
says
one
young
man
and
he
calls
for
another
drink
when
he
has
had
it
he
says
he
wishes
he
had
they
will
never
shell
the
town
says
a
choleric
old
englishman
and
he
adds
in
the
best
english
manner
it
could
never
be
permitted
outside
the
day
dies
down
the
sound
of
cannon
has
entirely
ceased
one
can
hear
nothing
now
nothing
at
all
but
the
loud
and
shrill
cries
of
the
newsboys
and
women
selling
matin
and
in
the
streets
a
strange
hushed
silence
hangs
over
the
besieged
city
and
through
the
silence
the
clocks
strike
six
and
almost
immediately
the
comes
along
and
informs
us
that
we
ought
to
come
in
to
dinner
soon
as
the
lights
must
go
out
at
nightfall
but
i
go
into
the
streets
instead
it
seems
to
me
that
the
population
of
antwerp
has
suddenly
turned
into
peasants
peasants
everywhere
in
crowds
in
groups
in
isolated
numbers
bareheaded
women
men
little
girls
and
boys
and
all
with
bundles
some
pathetically
small
done
up
in
white
or
blue
cloths
and
some
huge
and
grotesque
under
which
the
peasants
stagger
along
through
the
streets
that
were
fashionable
streets
only
just
now
and
now
have
turned
into
a
sort
of
sad
travesty
of
the
streets
of
some
distant
village
a
curious
rosy
hue
falls
over
the
faces
in
the
streets
the
glow
like
rubies
the
gold
on
the
gothic
buildings
burns
like
crimson
fire
overhead
a
magnificent
sunset
is
spreading
its
banners
out
over
the
deserted
city
then
night
falls
the
red
fades
antwerp
turns
grey
and
sombre
but
the
memory
of
that
rose
in
the
west
remains
and
in
hope
we
wait
we
are
still
waiting
knowing
not
what
the
morrow
may
bring
forth
chapter
xxx
wednesday
last
night
the
moon
was
so
bright
that
my
two
pets
rescued
from
the
ruins
of
lierre
woke
up
and
began
to
talk
or
was
it
the
big
guns
that
woke
them
the
canary
and
the
grey
congo
parrot
it
might
have
been
for
sometimes
the
city
seemed
to
shake
all
over
and
as
i
lay
in
bed
i
wondered
who
was
firing
germans
belgians
english
which
about
three
between
dozing
and
listening
to
the
cannon
i
heard
a
new
sound
a
strange
sound
something
so
awful
that
i
almost
felt
my
hair
creep
with
horror
it
was
a
man
crying
in
the
room
under
mine
through
the
blackness
of
the
hour
before
dawn
a
cry
came
stealing
fils
mon
fils
out
of
the
night
it
came
that
sudden
terrific
revelation
of
what
is
going
on
everywhere
beneath
the
outward
calm
of
this
nation
of
heroes
and
one
had
not
realised
it
because
one
had
seen
so
few
tears
one
had
almost
failed
to
understand
in
the
outer
calm
of
the
belgians
what
agony
went
on
beneath
and
now
in
the
midnight
the
veil
is
torn
aside
and
i
see
a
human
heart
in
extremis
writhing
with
agony
groaning
as
the
wounded
never
groan
stricken
bleeding
prostrate
overwhelmed
with
the
enormity
of
its
sorrow
fils
mon
fils
since
i
heard
that
old
man
weeping
i
want
to
creep
to
the
feet
of
christ
and
the
mother
of
christ
and
implore
their
healing
for
these
poor
innocent
broken
hearts
trodden
under
the
brutal
feet
of
another
race
of
human
beings
at
four
unable
to
sleep
i
rose
and
dressed
and
went
downstairs
in
the
dim
unswept
palm
court
i
saw
a
bearded
man
with
two
umbrellas
walking
feverishly
up
and
down
while
the
sleepy
night
porter
leaned
against
a
pillar
yawning
watching
for
the
cab
that
the
had
gone
to
look
for
it
came
at
last
and
the
bearded
gentleman
with
a
sigh
stepped
in
and
drove
away
into
the
dusky
dawn
a
look
of
unutterable
sadness
seeming
to
cloak
his
face
and
form
as
he
disappeared
est
triste
ce
monsieur
commented
our
voluble
little
flemish
porter
he
is
a
minister
of
the
government
and
he
must
leave
antwerp
he
must
depart
for
ostend
his
boat
leaves
at
five
this
morning
so
the
government
is
really
moving
out
i
think
to
myself
mechanically
a
little
boy
runs
in
from
the
chill
streets
it
is
only
four
but
a
flemish
paper
has
just
come
laatste
the
boy
throws
it
on
the
table
where
i
sit
writing
to
my
sister
in
england
who
is
anxious
for
my
safety
i
struggle
to
find
out
what
message
lies
behind
those
queer
flemish
words
toestand
te
antwerpen
is
zeer
what
does
it
mean
ernstig
is
it
good
is
it
bad
i
do
know
the
word
i
call
to
the
night
porter
and
he
comes
out
and
translates
to
me
and
as
i
glean
the
significance
of
the
news
i
admire
that
peasant
calm
situation
à
anvers
est
he
says
the
burgomaster
announces
to
the
population
that
the
bombardment
of
antwerp
and
its
environs
is
imminent
it
is
understood
of
course
translating
literally
that
neither
the
threat
nor
the
actual
bombardment
will
have
any
effect
on
the
strength
of
our
resistance
which
will
continue
to
the
very
last
extremity
so
we
know
the
worst
now
antwerp
is
not
to
hand
herself
over
to
the
germans
she
is
going
to
fight
to
the
death
well
we
are
glad
of
it
we
know
it
is
the
only
thing
she
could
have
done
and
now
the
hotel
wakes
right
up
and
dozens
of
sleepy
worn
officers
and
soldiers
in
dirty
boots
come
down
the
stairs
clamouring
for
their
the
morning
is
very
cold
and
they
shiver
sometimes
but
they
are
better
after
the
coffee
and
i
watch
them
all
go
off
smoking
cigarettes
poor
souls
poor
souls
after
the
coffee
smoking
cigarettes
they
hurry
away
to
the
day
is
past
sunrise
now
and
floods
of
golden
light
stream
over
the
city
where
already
great
crowds
are
moving
backwards
and
forwards
cabs
drive
up
continually
to
the
great
railway
station
opposite
with
piles
of
luggage
and
i
think
dreamily
how
very
like
they
are
to
london
taking
the
family
away
to
the
seaside
and
still
the
city
remains
marvellously
calm
in
spite
of
the
movements
people
are
going
away
in
hundreds
in
thousands
but
they
are
going
quietly
calmly
processions
of
nuns
file
along
the
avenues
under
the
fading
trees
long
lines
of
belgian
cyclists
flash
by
in
an
opposite
direction
in
their
gay
yellow
and
green
uniforms
the
blue
and
red
of
the
french
and
english
banners
never
looked
brighter
as
the
wind
plays
with
them
and
the
sunlight
sparkles
on
them
while
the
great
black
and
red
and
gold
belgian
flags
lend
that
curious
note
of
sombre
dignity
to
the
crowded
streets
but
not
a
word
of
regret
from
anyone
that
is
the
belgian
way
belgians
all
i
kneel
at
your
feet
oh
god
what
those
people
are
going
through
god
what
they
are
suffering
and
to
suffer
how
can
they
bear
it
where
do
they
get
their
heroism
is

it
must

chapter
xxxi
the
city
is
shelled
that
day
seated
in
wicker
chairs
in
the
palm
court
we
held
a
counsel
of
war
all
the
who
were
left
the
question
was
whether
the
hotel
terminus
was
not
in
too
dangerous
a
position
its
extreme
nearness
to
the
great
railway
station
made
its
shelling
almost
inevitable
when
the
bombardment
of
the
city
began
in
earnest
we
argued
a
lot
one
suggested
one
hotel
one
another
to
be
directly
northward
was
clearly
desirable
as
the
shells
would
come
from
southward
cherry
kearton
cleary
and
marshall
decided
on
the
hotel
somewhere
near
the
quay
their
point
was
that
it
would
be
easier
to
get
away
from
there
robinson
and
phillips
refused
to
change
from
the
terminus
fox
lucien
arthur
jones
and
myself
chose
the
wagner
as
being
in
the
most
northerly
direction
the
farthest
away
from
the
forts
and
the
nearest
to
the
breda
gate
which
led
to
holland
in
the
moonlight
after
dinner
taking
my
canary
with
me
i
moved
to
my
new
quarters
accompanied
to
the
doors
by
that
little
band
of
englishmen
cherry
kearton
carrying
my
parrot
it
was
then
ten
strange
things
were
to
happen
before
we
met
again
precisely
at
eleven
the
first
shell
fell
whiz
it
fled
in
a
fury
across
the
sky
and
burst
somewhere
in
the
direction
of
the
cathedral
as
it
exploded
i
shut
my
eyes
clenched
my
hands
and
sank
on
the
floor
by
my
bedside
saying
to
myself
god
i
dead
and
i
thought
i
was
too
the
enormity
of
that
seemed
to
belong
to
a
transition
from
this
world
to
the
next
it
scarcely
seemed
possible
to
pass
through
that
noise
and
come
out
alive
that
was
the
first
shell
and
others
followed
quickly
the
hotel
was
alive
immediately
sleep
was
impossible
i
crept
down
into
the
vestibule
it
was
all
dark
save
for
one
little
light
at
the
door
i
got
a
chair
drew
it
close
to
the
light
and
sat
down
i
had
a
and
pencil
and
to
calm
and
control
myself
and
not
let
my
brain
run
riot
i
made
notes
of
exactly
what
people
said
i
sat
there
all
night
long
every
now
and
then
the
doors
would
burst
open
and
men
and
women
would
rush
in
once
it
was
two
slim
elegant
ladies
in
black
with
white
fox
stoles
who
had
run
from
their
house
because
a
shell
had
set
fire
to
the
house
next
door
they
came
into
the
vestibule
moving
about
by
the
little
point
of
light
made
by
their
tiny
electric
torch
they
asked
for
a
room
there
was
none
so
they
asked
to
sit
in
the
dark
empty
restaurant
and
as
i
saw
them
disappear
into
that
black
room
where
many
refugees
were
already
gathered
sleeping
on
chairs
and
floors
and
tables
i
could
not
help
being
amazed
at
the
strangeness
of
it
all
the
unlikeness
of
it
all
to
life
these
two
sisters
with
their
gentle
manners
their
white
furs
their
electric
light
gliding
noiselessly
along
the
burning
beshelled
streets
and
asking
for
a
room
in
the
first
hotel
they
came
to
without
a
word
about
terror
and
with
expressions
on
their
faces
that
utterly
belied
the
looks
of
fright
and
terror
that
the
stage
has
almost
convinced
us
are
the
real
thing
swing
goes
the
door
and
in
comes
a
man
who
asks
the
porter
a
question
is
monsieur
l
here
oui
monsieur
replies
the
porter
where
is
he
he
is
in
bed
go
to
him
and
tell
him
that
a
shell
has
just
fallen
on
the
bank
of
anvers
tell
him
to
rise
and
come
out
at
once
he
is
a
bank
official
and
he
must
come
and
help
to
save
the
papers
before
the
bank
is
burned
down
tell
him
monsieur
the
manager
came
for
him
swing
and
the
bank
manager
has
gone
through
the
door
again
out
into
that
black
and
red
shrieking
night
swing
again
and
three
people
hurry
in
three
belgians
father
mother
and
a
little
girlie
whom
they
hold
by
each
hand
while
the
father
cradles
a
big
box
of
hard
cash
under
one
arm
the
shells
are
falling
all
around
our
home
they
say
the
porter
points
to
the
restaurant
door
merci
bien
and
je
vous
remerci
beaucoup
murmur
father
and
mother
they
vanish
into
the
dark
unlit
restaurant
with
its
white
making
pale
points
athward
the
stygian
blackness
of
the
huge
room
then
an
englishman
comes
down
the
stairs
behind
me
flapping
his
burberry
rainproof
overcoat
he
is
a
what
a
smell
he
says
to
the
porter
is
gas
escaping
somewhere
no
sir
says
the
porter
pulling
his
black
moustache
he
is
very
distrait
and
hardly
gives
the
famous
a
thought
it
gas
persists
the
there
must
be
a
leakage
somewhere
he
opens
the
door
a
horrible
whiff
of
burning
petroleum
and
smoke
blows
in
and
a
belgian
soldier
enters
also
what
the
smell
asks
the
the
germans
are
dropping
explosives
on
the
city
trying
to
set
fire
to
it
answers
the
belgian
good
lor
i
must
have
a
look
says
the
he
goes
out
two
wounded
officers
come
down
the
stairs
behind
me
bill
please
porter
how
much
we
must
be
off
now
to
the
forts
do
know
the
bill
says
the
porter
i
new
the
other
man
ran
away
he
did
like
shells
you
can
pay
some
other
time
messieurs
bien
says
the
officers
they
swing
their
dark
cloaks
across
their
shoulders
and
pass
out
they
come
back
no
more
no
never
any
more
then
an
old
old
man
limps
in
on
the
arm
of
a
young
sister
of
mercy
he
is
deaf
and
dumb
she
says
i
found
him
and
brought
him
here
he
will
be
killed
in
the
streets
her
smile
makes
sunshine
all
over
the
blackness
of
that
haunted
hall
the
mercy
of
it
the
sweetness
of
it
the
holiness
are
something
one
can
never
forget
as
guiding
the
old
man
she
leads
him
into
the
dark
restaurant
and
tends
him
through
the
night
then
again
the
door
swings
open
the
petroleum
tanks
have
been
set
on
fire
by
the
belgians
themselves
says
a
big
man
with
a
big
moustache
this
is
the
end
he
is
the
proprietor
himself
and
here
up
from
the
stairs
behind
us
that
lead
down
into
the
cellars
comes
his
wife
wrapped
in
furs
henri
i
heard
your
voice
i
am
going
i
can
not
stand
it
i
shall
flee
to
holland
with
little
marie
put
me
into
the
motor
car
my
legs
will
not
carry
me
i
fear
for
the
child
so
much
a
kiss
and
she
and
little
marie
flee
away
through
the
madness
of
the
night
towards
the
breda
gate
and
the
safety
of
some
dutch
village
across
the
border
every
now
and
then
i
would
open
the
and
fly
like
mad
on
to
the
corner
of
the
avenue
de
commerce
and
there
casting
one
swift
glance
right
and
left
i
would
take
in
the
awful
panorama
of
scarlet
flames
they
were
leaping
now
over
the
marché
aux
souliers
the
street
which
corresponds
with
our
strand
while
i
watched
i
heard
the
shrieking
rush
of
one
shell
after
another
any
one
of
which
might
of
course
well
have
fallen
where
i
stood
but
i
knew
they
would
i
felt
as
safe
and
secure
there
in
that
corner
as
if
i
had
been
a
child
again
at
home
in
silent
sleepy
australia
the
fact
is
when
you
are
in
the
midst
of
danger
with
shells
bursting
round
you
and
the
city
on
fire
and
the
germans
closing
in
on
you
and
your
friends
and
home
many
hundreds
of
miles
away
your
brain
works
in
an
entirely
different
way
from
when
you
are
living
safely
in
your
peaceful
midlands
quite
unconsciously
one
ego
asserts
itself
in
danger
until
it
seems
that
one
carries
within
one
a
world
so
important
so
limitless
and
immortal
that
it
appears
invincible
before
hurt
or
death
this
is
an
illusion
of
course
but
what
a
beautiful
and
merciful
one
when
danger
comes
your
way
this
illusion
will
begin
to
weave
a
sort
of
fairy
haze
around
you
making
you
feel
that
those
shrieking
shells
can
never
fall
on
you
seldom
indeed
while
i
was
at
the
front
did
i
hear
anyone
say
afraid
how
deeply
and
compassionately
considerate
nature
is
to
us
all
she
has
supplied
us
with
a
store
of
emotional
glands
and
fitted
us
up
with
many
a
varying
sensation
of
which
curiosity
is
the
liveliest
and
strongest
then
when
it
comes
to
a
race
between
fear
and
curiosity
in
cases
out
of
a
hundred
curiosity
wins
hands
down
in
real
danger
our
curiosity
and
our
unconscious
but
belief
in
the
ego
carry
us
right
over
the
frightful
terrors
that
we
imagine
we
should
feel
were
we
thinking
the
thing
out
quietly
in
a
safe
land
we
tremble
and
shiver
we
remember
the
word
scream
we
understand
the
meaning
of
fear
we
run
in
our
thoughts
into
caves
and
cellars
but
when
the
real
thing
comes
we
put
our
heads
out
of
the
windows
we
run
out
into
the
streets
we
go
towards
danger
and
not
away
from
it
driven
thither
by
the
mighty
emotion
of
curiosity
which
when
all
is
said
and
done
is
one
of
the
most
delightful
because
the
most
electrifying
of
all
human
sensations
is
this
brutal
is
it
is
it
callous
indifferent
cruel
for
it
bears
no
relation
to
our
feelings
for
other
people
only
relates
to
our
own
sensations
about
when
a
group
of
wounded
belgians
comes
limping
along
you
look
into
their
hollow
blackened
faces
you
feel
your
heart
break
and
all
your
soul
seems
to
dissolve
in
one
mighty
longing
to
die
for
these
people
who
have
sacrificed
their
all
for
and
you
run
to
them
you
help
them
all
you
can
you
experience
a
passionate
desire
to
give
them
everything
you
have
you
turn
out
your
pockets
for
them
you
search
for
something
anything
that
will
help
them
no
you
are
not
callous
because
you
are
curious
quite
the
reverse
in
fact
you
are
curious
because
you
are
alive
because
you
dwell
in
this
one
earth
and
because
you
are
created
with
the
sense
that
you
have
a
right
to
see
and
hear
all
the
strange
and
wonderful
things
all
the
terrors
as
well
as
all
the
glories
that
go
to
make
up
human
existence
not
to
care
not
to
want
to
see
not
to
want
to
know
that
is
the
callousness
beyond
redemption
chapter
xxxii
thursday
thursday
is
a
queer
day
a
day
of
no
beginning
and
no
ending
it
is
haunted
by
such
immense
noise
that
it
loses
all
likeness
to
what
we
know
in
ordinary
life
as
a
day
the
thing
that
comes
in
between
two
nights
it
is
in
fact
nothing
but
one
cataclysmal
bang
and
shriek
of
shells
and
shrapnel
the
earth
seems
to
break
open
from
its
centre
every
five
minutes
or
so
and
my
brain
begins
to
formulate
to
itself
a
tremendous
sense
of
height
and
space
as
well
as
of
noise
until
i
feel
as
though
i
am
in
touch
with
the
highest
skies
as
well
as
with
the
lowest
earth
because
things
that
seem
to
belong
essentially
to
earth
are
now
happening
in
the
skies
the
roof
of
the
world
is
now
enacting
a
rôle
that
is
just
as
strange
and
just
as
surprising
as
if
the
roof
of
a
theatre
had
suddenly
begun
to
take
part
in
a
drama
one
looks
above
as
often
as
one
looks
below
or
around
one
flinging
themselves
forward
with
thin
whinging
cries
like
millions
of
mosquitoes
on
the
attack
the
shrapnel
rushes
perpetually
overhead
and
the
shells
pour
down
upon
the
city
deafening
stupefying
until
at
last
by
the
very
immensity
of
their
noise
they
gradually
lose
their
power
to
affect
one
even
though
they
break
all
round
instead
of
listening
to
the
bombardment
i
find
myself
listening
crossly
to
the
creaking
of
our
lift
which
makes
noises
exactly
like
those
of
the
shrapnel
outside
in
fact
when
i
am
in
my
bedroom
and
the
lift
is
going
up
and
down
i
really
do
know
which
is
lift
and
which
is
shrapnel
seven
on
thursday
morning
the
bombardment
goes
on
fiercely
but
i
forget
about
it
here
in
the
big
bare
smoky
café
because
i
can
not
hear
the
lift
a
waiter
brings
me
some
coffee
and
i
stand
and
drink
it
and
look
about
me
the
café
is
surrounded
with
glass
doors
and
through
these
doors
i
see
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
hurrying
for
dear
life
along
the
roads
as
time
goes
on
their
numbers
increase
until
they
are
flowing
by
as
steadily
as
some
ceaseless
black
stream
moving
men
women
children
nuns
priests
motor
cars
carriages
cabs
carts
drays
trolleys
perambulators
every
species
of
human
being
and
of
vehicle
goes
hurrying
past
the
windows
and
always
the
vehicles
are
laden
to
the
very
utmost
with
their
freight
of
human
life
one
brain
reels
before
the
immensity
of
this
thing
that
is
happening
here
a
city
is
being
evacuated
by
a
million
inhabitants
the
city
is
in
flames
and
shells
are
raining
down
on
it
yet
the
cook
is
making
soup
in
the
kitchen
among
the
human
beings
struggling
onwards
towards
the
breda
gate
which
will
lead
them
to
holland
making
strange
little
notes
in
the
middle
of
the
human
beings
i
see
every
now
and
then
some
poor
pathetic
animal
moving
along
in
timid
bewilderment
a
sheep
a
dog
a
donkey
a
cow
a
horse
more
cows
perhaps
than
anything
big
simple
wondering
cows
trudging
along
behind
desolate
little
groups
of
peasants
with
all
their
little
worldly
belongings
tied
up
in
a
big
check
handkerchief
while
crash
over
their
heads
goes
on
the
cannonading
from
the
forts
and
with
each
fresh
shock
the
vast
concourse
of
fleeing
people
starts
and
hurries
forward
it
seems
to
me
as
though
the
end
of
the
world
will
be
very
like
a
huge
crowded
with
people
is
passing
it
is
twenty
feet
long
and
drawn
by
two
great
bulky
flemish
horses
sitting
all
along
the
middle
with
great
wood
stakes
fixed
along
the
edges
to
keep
them
from
falling
out
are
different
families
getting
away
into
holland
fathers
mothers
children
two
men
go
by
with
a
covered
with
a
blanket
dozens
of
beautiful
dogs
bereft
of
their
collars
in
this
final
parting
with
their
masters
run
wildly
back
and
forth
along
the
roads
a
boy
with
a
bicycle
is
wheeling
an
old
man
on
it
three
wounded
blue
and
scarlet
soldiers
march
along
desolately
carrying
brown
paper
parcels
belgian
boy
scouts
in
khaki
with
yellow
handkerchiefs
round
their
necks
flash
past
on
bicycles
a
man
pushes
a
with
his
three
children
and
his
wife
in
it
while
the
yellow
dog
trots
along
underneath
his
tongue
out
a
priest
rides
by
mounted
on
a
great
chestnut
mare
with
a
scarlet
saddle
cloth
all
the
dramas
of
æschylus
pale
into
insignificance
before
this
scene
it
is
more
than
a
procession
of
human
beings
it
is
a
procession
of
broken
hearts
of
torn
bleeding
souls
and
ruined
homes
of
desolate
lives
of
blighted
hopes
and
grim
grey
despair
grim
grey
despair
in
a
thousand
shapes
and
forms
and
ever
it
hurries
along
the
roads
ever
it
blocks
the
hotel
windows
casting
its
thick
shadows
as
the
sun
rises
in
the
heavens
defying
the
black
smoke
palls
that
hang
athwart
the
skies
sometimes
i
find
tears
streaming
down
my
cheeks
and
as
they
splash
on
my
hands
i
look
at
them
stupidly
and
wonder
what
they
are
and
why
they
come
for
no
one
can
think
clearly
now
once
it
is
the
sight
of
a
little
young
childlike
nun
guarding
an
old
tottering
man
who
is
dumb
as
well
as
deaf
and
who
can
only
walk
with
short
little
halting
steps
is
she
really
going
to
try
and
get
him
to
holland
i
wonder
chapter
xxxiii
the
endless
day
years
seem
to
have
passed
yet
it
is
still
thursday
morning
ten
the
horror
darkens
we
know
the
worst
now
antwerp
is
doomed
nothing
can
save
her
poor
beautiful
stately
city
that
has
seemed
to
us
all
so
utterly
impregnable
all
these
months
the
evacuation
goes
on
desperately
but
the
crowds
fleeing
northwards
are
diminishing
visibly
because
some
five
hundred
thousands
have
already
gone
the
great
avenues
with
their
trees
and
white
tall
splendid
houses
grow
bare
and
deserted
over
the
city
creeps
a
terrible
look
an
aspect
so
poignant
so
pathetic
that
it
reminds
me
of
a
dying
soldier
passing
away
in
the
flower
of
his
youth
the
very
walls
of
the
high
white
houses
the
very
flags
of
the
stony
grey
streets
seem
to
know
that
antwerp
has
fallen
victim
to
a
tragic
fate
her
men
women
and
children
must
desert
her
her
homes
must
stand
silent
cold
and
lonely
waiting
for
the
enemy
her
great
hotels
must
be
emptied
her
shops
and
factories
must
put
up
their
shutters
all
the
bright
gay
cheerful
optimistic
life
of
this
city
that
i
have
grown
to
love
with
an
indescribable
tenderness
during
the
long
weeks
that
i
have
spent
within
her
fortified
area
is
darkened
now
with
despair
of
the
ultimate
arrival
of
the
germans
there
is
no
longer
any
doubt
whether
they
take
the
town
on
a
surrender
or
by
bombardment
or
by
assault
i
put
on
my
hat
and
gloves
and
go
out
into
the
streets
oh
god
what
a
golden
day
unbearable
is
the
glitter
of
this
sunlight
shining
over
the
agony
of
a
nation
chapter
xxxiv
i
decide
to
stay
for
the
moment
the
bombardment
has
ceased
entirely
these
little
pauses
are
almost
quaint
in
their
preciseness
one
can
count
on
them
quite
confidently
not
to
be
broken
by
stray
shells
and
in
the
pause
i
am
rushing
along
the
avenue
de
commerce
trying
to
get
round
to
the
hotel
where
all
my
belongings
are
when
i
run
into
three
englishmen
with
their
arms
full
of
bags
and
overcoats
and
umbrellas
and
for
a
moment
or
two
we
stand
there
at
the
corner
opposite
the
gare
central
all
talking
together
breathlessly
it
was
only
last
night
at
seven
that
we
all
dined
together
at
the
terminus
but
since
then
a
million
years
have
rolled
over
us
we
have
been
snatched
into
one
of
history
most
terrific
pages
and
we
all
have
a
burning
breathless
saga
of
our
own
hanging
on
our
lips
crying
to
be
told
aloud
before
the
world
we
all
fling
out
disjointed
remarks
and
i
hear
of
the
awful
night
in
that
quarter
of
the
city
how
are
you
going
to
get
away
and
you
how
are
you
going
to
get
away
the
tall
slight
young
man
with
the
little
dark
moustache
is
jeffries
of
the
who
has
been
staying
at
the
hotel
de
with
him
is
the
popular
perry
robinson
of
the
the
third

phillips
of
the
i
have
just
come
from
the
état
majeur
jeffries
tells
me
hurriedly
there
is
not
a
ghost
of
a
hope
now
everyone
has
gone
we
must
get
away
at
once
i
am
not
going
i
say
for
suddenly
the
knowledge
has
come
to
me
that
i
can
not
leave
the
greatest
of
my
dramas
before
the
curtain
rolls
up
in
the
last
scene
in
vain
they
argue
tell
me
i
am
mad
i
am
not
going
so
they
say
and
leave
me
chapter
xxxv
the
city
surrenders
antwerp
has
surrendered
it
is
friday
morning
all
hope
is
over
the
germans
are
coming
in
at
one
well
says
lucien
arthur
jones
at
last
at
the
end
of
a
long
discussion
between
him
and
frank
fox
and
myself
if
you
have
really
decided
to
stay
i
going
to
give
you
this
key
it
belongs
to
the
house
of
some
wealthy
belgians
who
have
fled
to
england
there
is
plenty
of
food
and
stores
of
all
kind
in
the
house
if
need
be
you
might
take
shelter
there
and
he
gave
me
the
key
and
the
address
and
i
luckily
for
myself
i
remembered
it
afterwards
with
a
queer
little
choke
in
my
throat
i
stood
on
the
hotel
watching
those
two
englishmen
on
their
bicycles
whirling
away
down
the
avenue
de
commerce
in
a
moment
they
were
swallowed
up
from
my
sight
in
the
black
pall
of
cloud
and
smoke
that
hung
above
the
city
dropping
from
the
leaden
skies
like
long
black
fringes
and
hovering
over
the
streets
like
thick
funeral
veils
so
they
were
gone
the
die
was
cast
i
was
alone
now
all
alone
in
the
fated
city
at
first
the
thought
was
a
little
sickening
but
after
a
minute
it
gave
me
a
certain
amount
of
relief
as
i
realised
that
i
could
go
ahead
with
my
plans
without
causing
anyone
distress
to
feel
that
those
two
men
had
been
worrying
about
my
safety
and
were
worrying
still
was
a
very
wretched
sensation
they
had
enough
to
think
of
on
their
own
account
somehow
or
other
they
had
now
to
get
to
a
telegraph
wire
and
send
their
newspapers
in
england
the
story
of
antwerp
fall
and
the
task
before
them
was
herculean
the
nearest
wires
were
in
holland
and
they
had
nothing
but
their
bicycles
turning
back
into
the
big
dim
deserted
restaurant
i
went
to
look
for
the
old
patronne
whose
black
eyes
dilated
in
her
sad
old
yellow
face
at
the
sight
of
me
in
my
dark
blue
suit
and
white
veil
floating
from
my
little
black
hat
what
madame
but
they
told
me
deux
have
departed
you
have
not
gone
with
them
listen
madame
i
want
you
to
help
me
i
am
writing
a
book
about
the
war
and
to
see
the
germans
come
into
antwerp
is
something
i
ought
not
to
miss
i
want
to
stay
here
dangereux
madame
vous
êtes
anglaise
well
i
going
to
change
that
i
going
to
be
belgian
i
want
you
to
let
me
pretend
i
a
servant
in
your
hotel
i
put
on
a
cap
and
apron
and
i
do
anything
you
like
then
i
be
able
to
see
things
for
myself
it
only
be
for
a
few
hours
i
get
away
this
afternoon
in
the
motor
but
i
must
see
the
incoming
of
the
germans
first
the
old
woman
seemed
too
bewildered
to
protest
and
afterwards
i
doubted
if
she
had
really
understood
me
from
the
way
she
acted
later
on
just
at
that
moment
henri
drove
up
in
the
motor
and
came
to
a
standstill
in
front
of
the
hotel
the
poor
fellow
looked
more
dead
than
alive
his
face
was
hollow
his
lips
were
dry
his
eyes
standing
out
of
his
head
he
was
so
exhausted
that
he
could
scarcely
step
out
of
the
car
i
am
sorry
i
am
late
he
groaned
but
it
was
impossible
impossible
you
need
worry
about
me
henri
i
whispered
to
him
reassuringly
i
not
going
to
try
to
get
out
of
antwerp
for
several
hours
in
fact
i
am
going
to
wait
to
see
the
germans
come
in
henri
showed
no
surprise
there
was
no
surprise
left
in
him
to
show
bon
he
said
because
to
tell
you
the
truth
madame
i
would
go
out
of
the
city
again
just
now
i
could
do
it
getting
to
holland
indeed
he
went
on
between
gasps
as
he
drank
off
one
cup
of
coffee
after
another
it
like
trying
to
get
through
hell
to
get
to
paradise
i
been
seven
hours
driving
about
four
miles
there
and
back
it
was
horrible
it
was
unbelievable
the
roads
are
blocked
so
thick
that
there
are
no
roads
left
a
million
people
are
out
there
struggling
fighting
and
trying
to
get
onwards
lying
down
on
the
earth
fainting
dying
and
he
suddenly
sat
down
upon
a
chair
and
fell
fast
asleep
the
sharp
crack
crack
of
rifle
fire
woke
him
about
five
minutes
later
and
we
all
rushed
to
the
door
to
see
what
was
happening
oh
sight
across
the
grey
square
through
the
morning
dogs
were
rushing
their
tongues
out
the
gendarmes
pursuing
them
were
shooting
them
down
to
save
them
the
worse
horrors
of
starvation
that
might
befall
them
if
they
were
left
alive
in
the
deserted
city
at
the
mercy
of
the
germans
madame
x
a
sad
woman
a
refugee
from
lierre
whose
house
had
been
shelled
and
who
was
destined
to
play
a
strange
part
in
my
story
later
on
now
came
over
to
us
and
implored
henri
to
take
her
old
mother
in
his
car
round
to
the
hospital
she
is
pauvre
we
tried
to
take
her
to
holland
but
it
was
impossible
but
now
that
the
bombardment
has
ceased
and
the
worst
is
over
it
seems
wiser
to
remain
in
the
hospital
the
mère
will
be
surely
safe
as
for
us
my
husband
and
i
truly
we
have
lost
our
all
there
is
nothing
left
to
fear
i
offered
to
accompany
the
old
lady
to
the
hospital
and
presently
we
started
off
henri
and
i
and
the
old
wrinkled
flemish
woman
and
the
buxom
young
flemish
servant
jeanette
we
drove
along
the
avenue
de
commerce
down
the
avenue
de
kaiser
towards
the
hospital
the
town
was
dead
not
a
soul
was
to
be
seen
the
marché
aux
souliers
was
all
ablaze
i
saw
the
taverne
royale
lying
on
the
ground
next
to
it
was
the
hotel
de
and
terrific
in
its
ruins
i
thought
of
jeffries
of
the
and
shivered
that
had
been
his
hotel
the
air
reeked
with
petroleum
and
smoke
at
last
we
got
to
the
hospital
the
was
covered
with
blood
and
red
wet
blood
was
in
drops
and
patches
along
the
entrance
as
i
went
in
an
unforgettable
sight
met
my
eyes
i
found
myself
in
a
great
dim
ward
with
the
yellow
lurid
skies
looking
in
through
its
enormous
windows
and
its
beds
full
of
wounded
and
dying
soldiers
and
just
as
i
entered
a
sister
of
mercy
was
bending
over
a
bed
giving
the
last
unction
to
a
dying
man
some
brave
who
had
shed
his
for
his
city
alas
in
vain
all
the
ordinary
nurses
had
gone
the
sisters
of
mercy
alone
remained
and
suddenly
it
came
to
me
like
a
strain
of
heavenly
music
that
death
held
no
terrors
for
these
women
life
had
no
fears
softly
they
moved
about
in
their
white
robes
their
benign
faces
shining
with
the
look
of
the
cross
in
that
supreme
moment
after
the
hell
of
shot
and
shell
after
the
thousands
of
wounded
and
dead
after
the
endless
agonies
of
attack
and
repulse
and
attack
and
defeat
and
surrender
something
quite
unexpected
was
here
emerging
the
essence
of
the
eternal
feminine
the
woman
supreme
in
her
sheer
womanhood
and
like
a
bright
bird
rising
from
the
ashes
the
spirit
of
it
went
fluttering
about
that
appalling
ward
the
trained
and
untrained
hospital
nurses
devoted
as
they
were
and
splendid
and
useful
beyond
all
words
had
perforce
fled
from
the
city
either
to
accompany
their
escaping
hospitals
or
beset
by
quite
natural
fears
of
the
huns
brutality
to
their
kind
but
the
sisters
of
mercy
had
no
fears
the
cross
stood
between
them
and
anything
that
might
come
to
them
and
that
was
written
in
their
faces
their
shining
gentle
faces
ah
yes
the
priests
and
the
sisters
of
mercy
have
indeed
come
back
to
their
own
in
this
greatest
of
all
wars
moving
between
the
long
lines
of
soldiers
beds
i
paused
at
the
side
of
a
little
belgian
boy
whose
dark
eyes
opened
suddenly
to
meet
mine
i
think
he
must
have
been
wandering
poor
little
child
and
had
come
back
with
a
start
to
life
and
seeing
a
face
at
his
bedside
he
thought
perhaps
that
i
was
german
in
a
hoarse
voice
he
gasped
out
raising
himself
in
terror
suis
civil
poor
child
poor
child
the
fright
in
his
voice
was
it
said
that
if
the
took
him
for
a
they
would
shoot
him
or
carry
him
away
into
germany
i
bent
and
kissed
him
suis
civil
he
was
not
more
than
six
years
old
in
another
room
of
the
hospital
i
found
about
forty
children
little
children
varying
from
six
months
to
five
years
some
gentle
nuns
were
playing
with
them
les
pauvres
petites
said
one
of
the
sisters
compassionately
all
been
lost
or
left
behind
there
no
one
to
claim
them
so
we
have
brought
them
here
to
look
after
them
and
the
baby
gurgled
and
laughed
and
gave
a
sudden
leap
in
the
sweet
nun
arms
out
of
the
hospital
again
over
the
doorstep
and
back
into
the
car
there
were
a
few
devoted
doctors
and
priests
standing
about
in
silence
in
the
passage
entrance
to
the
hospital
they
were
waiting
for
the
end
waiting
for
the
germans
to
come
in
i
can
see
them
still
standing
there
in
their
white
coats
or
long
black
cassocks
staring
down
the
passage
a
great
hush
hung
over
everything
and
through
the
hush
we
slid
into
the
awful
streets
again
with
the
houses
lying
on
the
ground
before
we
had
gone
far
we
heard
shouts
and
turning
my
head
i
discovered
some
wounded
soldiers
limping
along
a
who
were
begging
us
to
give
them
a
lift
towards
the
boat
we
filled
the
car
so
full
that
we
all
had
to
stand
up
except
those
who
could
not
stand
bandaged
heads
and
faces
were
all
around
me
while
bandaged
soldiers
rode
on
the
clinging
to
whatever
they
could
get
hold
of
and
then
we
moved
towards
the
quay
it
was
to
have
to
deny
the
scores
of
limping
broken
men
who
shouted
to
us
to
stop
but
as
soon
as
we
had
deposited
one
load
we
went
back
and
picked
up
others
and
ran
them
back
to
the
quay
and
that
we
did
time
after
time
a
few
of
the
men
were
our
own
tommies
but
most
were
belgians
backwards
and
forwards
we
rushed
backwards
and
forwards
and
now
that
dear
henri
eyes
were
shining
his
sallow
face
was
lit
up
he
no
longer
looked
tired
and
dull
and
heavy
he
was
on
fire
with
excitement
and
the
car
raced
like
mad
backwards
and
forwards
backwards
and
forwards
venturing
right
out
towards
the
forts
and
back
again
to
the
quay
until
at
last
reaction
set
in
with
henri
and
he
was
obliged
to
take
the
car
back
to
the
hotel
where
he
fell
in
a
crumpled
heap
in
a
corner
of
the
restaurant
as
we
came
in
the
patronne
handed
me
a
note
while
you
were
out
she
said
looking
at
me
sorrowfully
fox
and
jones
returned
on
their
bicycles
to
look
for
you
then
i
read
fox
kind
message
we
have
managed
to
secure
passages
on
a
special
military
boat
for
flushing
that
leaves
at
eleven
and
of
course
we
have
got
one
for
you
we
have
come
back
for
you
but
you
are
not
here
your
car
has
arrived
so
you
will
be
all
right
i
hope
you
have
seen
the
bombardment
through
bravo
i
was
glad
they
had
got
away
but
for
myself
some
absolutely
irresistible
force
held
me
to
antwerp
and
i
now
slipped
quietly
out
of
the
hotel
and
started
off
on
a
solitary
walk
chapter
xxxvi
a
solitary
walk
surely
surely
this
livid
noontide
hanging
over
antwerp
was
conceived
in
hades
as
a
presentation
of
the
world
last
day
indescribably
terrible
in
tone
and
form
because
of
its
unearthly
qualities
of
smoke
shrapnel
and
broken
dissipated
clouds
the
darkened
skies
seemed
of
themselves
to
offer
every
element
of
tragedy
while
the
city
lying
stretched
out
beneath
in
that
agony
of
silence
that
lasted
from
twelve
to
one
was
one
vast
study
in
blood
fire
ruined
houses
ruined
pathways
smoke
appalling
odours
and
surrender
the
last
steamer
had
gone
from
the
port
the
last
of
the
fleeing
inhabitants
had
departed
by
the
breda
gate
all
that
was
left
now
was
the
empty
city
waiting
for
the
entrance
of
the
germans
empty
were
the
streets
empty
were
the
boats
crowded
desolately
on
the
scheldt
empty
were
those
hundreds
of
deserted
motor
cars
heaped
in
great
weird
pathetic
piles
down
at
the
water
edge
as
useless
as
though
they
were
perambulators
because
there
were
no
chauffeurs
to
drive
them
empty
was
the
air
of
sound
except
for
the
howling
of
dogs
that
ran
about
in
terror
crying
miserably
for
their
owners
who
had
been
obliged
to
desert
them
through
the
emptiness
of
the
air
when
the
dogs
were
not
howling
resounded
only
a
terrible
ferocious
silence
that
seemed
to
call
up
mocking
memories
of
the
noise
the
shells
had
been
making
incessantly
ever
since
two
nights
ago
it
was
an
hour
never
to
be
forgotten
an
hour
that
could
never
never
come
again
i
kept
saying
that
to
myself
as
i
continued
my
solitary
walk
solitary
walk
for
the
first
time
in
a
lifetime
that
bit
of
journalese
took
on
a
meaning
so
deep
and
elemental
that
it
went
right
down
to
the
very
roots
of
the
language
the
whole
city
was
mine
i
seemed
to
be
the
only
living
being
left
i
passed
hundreds
of
tall
white
stately
houses
all
shattered
and
locked
and
silent
and
deserted
i
went
through
one
wide
deadly
street
after
another
i
looked
up
and
down
the
great
paralysed
quays
i
stared
through
the
yellow
avenues
of
trees
i
heard
my
own
footsteps
echoing
echoing
the
ghosts
of
five
hundred
thousand
people
floated
before
my
vision
for
weeks
for
months
i
had
seen
these
five
hundred
thousand
people
laughing
and
talking
in
these
very
streets
and
yesterday
and
the
day
before
i
had
seen
them
fleeing
for
their
lives
out
of
the
city
anywhere
anywhere
out
of
the
reach
of
the
shells
and
the
germans
and
i
wondered
where
they
were
now
those
five
hundred
thousand
ghosts
were
they
still
struggling
and
tramping
and
falling
along
the
roads
to
holland
as
i
wondered
i
kept
on
seeing
their
faces
in
these
their
doorways
and
at
these
their
windows
i
saw
them
seated
at
these
their
cafés
along
the
i
heard
their
rich
liquid
antwerp
voices
speaking
french
with
a
soft
swift
rush
or
twanging
away
at
flemish
with
the
staccato
insistence
of
flanders
i
felt
them
all
around
me
in
all
the
deserted
streets
at
all
the
shuttered
windows
it
was
too
colossal
a
thing
to
realise
that
the
five
hundred
thousand
of
them
were
not
in
their
city
any
longer
that
they
were
not
hiding
behind
the
silence
and
the
shutters
but
were
out
in
the
open
world
beyond
the
city
gates
fighting
their
way
to
holland
and
freedom
and
now
i
wondered
why
i
was
here
myself
listening
to
my
echoing
footsteps
through
the
hollow
silences
of
the
ville
morte
why
had
i
not
gone
with
the
rest
of
them
then
as
i
walked
through
the
dead
city
i
knew
why
i
was
there
it
was
because
the
gods
had
been
keeping
for
me
all
these
years
the
supreme
gift
of
this
solitary
walk
when
i
should
share
her
with
this
city
i
so
passionately
loved
that
was
the
truth
i
had
been
unable
to
tear
myself
away
if
antwerp
suffered
i
desired
to
suffer
too
i
desired
to
go
hand
in
hand
with
her
in
whatever
happened
when
the
germans
came
marching
in
many
a
time
before
had
i
loved
a
city
loved
her
for
her
beauty
her
fairness
her
spirit
her
history
her
personal
significance

me

one

limpid
gladness
at
discovering
oneself
alive
but
antwerp
was
the
first
and
only
city
that
i
loved
because
she
let
me
share
her
sufferings
with
her
right
through
the
valley
of
death
right
up
to
the
moment
when
she
breathed
her
last
sigh
as
a
city
and
passed
into
the
possession
of
her
conquerors
suddenly
through
the
terrific
inconceivable
lull
hurtling
with
a
million
memories
of
noises
i
heard
footsteps
heavy
dragging
yet
hurried
and
looking
up
a
opposite
the
burning
ruins
of
the
chaussée
de
souliers
i
saw
two
belgian
soldiers
limping
along
making
towards
the
breda
gate
both
were
wounded
and
the
one
who
was
less
bad
was
helping
the
other
they
were
starved
ghastly
with
a
growth
of
black
beard
and
the
ravages
of
smoke
and
powder
all
over
their
poor
faded
blue
uniforms
and
little
scarlet
and
yellow
caps
they
were
dazed
finished
famished
nearly
fainting
but
as
they
hurried
past
me
the
younger
man
flung
out
one
breathless
question
que
la
ville
est
prise
it
seemed
to
be
plucked
from
some
page
of
homer
its
potency
was
so
epic
so
immense
that
i
felt
as
if
i
must
remain
there
for
ever
rooted
to
the
spot
where
i
had
heard
it
it
went
thrilling
through
my
being
it
struck
me
harder
than
any
shell
seeming
to
fell
me
for
a
moment
to
the
ground
then
i
rose
permeated
with
a
sense
of
living
in
the
world
greatest
drama
and
not
art
and
life
and
death
and
literature
inextricably
and
terribly
yet
gloriously
mixed
till
one
could
not
be
told
from
the
other
for
he
who
had
given
his
life
whose
blood
dropped
red
from
him
as
he
moved
knew
not
what
had
happened
to
his
city
he
was
only
a
soldier
his
was
to
fight
not
to
know
que
la
ville
est
prise
it
is
months
since
then
but
i
still
hear
that
perishing
voice
breaking
over
his
terrific
query
presently
rousing
myself
i
ran
onwards
and
walked
beside
the
men
giving
my
arm
to
the
younger
one
who
took
it
mechanically
without
thanking
me
i
liked
that
and
all
together
we
hastened
through
the
livid
greyness
along
the
avenue
de
commerce
towards
the
breda
gate
in
dead
silence
we
laboured
onwards
it
was
still
a
solitary
walk
for
neither
of
my
companions
said
a
word
only
sometimes
without
speaking
one
of
them
would
turn
his
head
and
look
backwards
without
stopping
at
the
red
flames
reflected
in
the
black
sky
to
northward
suddenly
to
our
amazement
we
saw
a
cart
coming
down
a
containing
a
man
and
a
little
girl
i
ran
like
lightning
towards
it
terrified
lest
it
should
pass
but
that
man
in
the
cart
had
a
soul
he
had
seen
the
bleeding
soldiers
he
was
stopping
of
himself
he
offered
to
take
me
too
quick
quick
mes
amis
he
said
the
germans
are
coming
in
at
the
other
end
even
now
the
petite
here
was
lost
and
thanks
to
the
bon
dieu
i
have
just
found
her
that
is
why
i
am
so
late
as
the
soldiers
crawled
painfully
into
the
little
cart
i
whispered
to
the
elder
one
do
you
know
where
your
king
is
monsieur
ah
the
flash
in
that
hollow
eye
it
was
worth
risking
one
life
to
see
it
and
to
hear
the
love
that
leapt
into
the
belgian
voice
as
he
answered
truly
i
know
not
exactly
but
wherever
he
is
i
know
this

sur
le
champ
de
oh
beautiful
speech

where
else
would
albert
be
indeed
le

i
put
it
beside
the
epic
question
together
they
lie
there
in
my
heart
imperishable
and
more
precious
than
any
written
poem

it
is
now

and
i
am
back
at
the
hotel
at
least
my
watch
says
it
is
one
but
all
the
many
great
clocks
in
antwerp
have
stopped
the
day
before
and
their
hands
point
mockingly
to
a
dozen
different
times
one
knows
that
only
some
ghastly
happening
could
have
terrified
them
into
such
wild
mistakes
it
is
as
well
as
appalling
to
see
those
distracted
timepieces
and
their
ignorance
of
the
fatal
hour

and
the
clocks
point
pathetically
to
eleven

sprung
from

some
stewed

rough
dish
this
is
the
first
bad
meal
i
have
had

what
seems
extraordinary
to
me
is
that
there
should
be
any
meal
at
all

we
sit
round
the
table
in
the
darkness
of
that
lurid
noontide
the

looks
in
through

broken

there
comes
over
us
all
a
tension
so
great
that
nobody
can
utter
a
word
we
are
all
thinking
the
same
thing
we
are
thinking
with
our
dull
addled
clouded
brains
that
the
germans

be
here

then
suddenly
the
waiter
cries
out
in

loud
voice

all
spring
to

shew
on
the
then
more
appear
and
more
still
and
as
the
procession
of
the
germans
comes
onwards
through
the
town
i
discover
little
groups
of
men
and
women
sprung
out
of
the
very
earth
it
seems
to
me
all
along
the
avenue
de
commerce
gathered
in
the
heavy
greyness
on
the
are
little
straggling
groups
of
as
i
look
at
them
i
suddenly
experience
a
sensation
of
suffocation
am
i
dreaming
or
are
they
really
those
people
to
the
germans
then
to
my
horror
i
see
two
old
men
waving
gaily
to
that
long
grey
oncoming
line
of
men
and
horses
and
then
i
see
a
woman
flinging
flowers
to
an
officer
who
catches
them
and
sticks
them
into
his
horse
bridle
at
that
moment
i
realise
i
am
in
for
some
extraordinary
experience
something
that
brussels
has
not
in
the
least
prepared
me
for
chapter
xl
the
laughter
of
brutes
along
the
avenue
the
grey
uniforms
are
slowly
marching
headed
by
fair
arrogant
officers
on
splendid
roan
horses
and
the
clang
and
clatter
of
them
breaks
up
the
silence
with
a
dramatic
sharpness
the
silence
that
has
never
been
heard
in
antwerp
since
as
they
come
onward
the
germans
look
from
left
to
right
i
stand
on
the
pavement
watching
drawn
there
by
some
irresistible
force
eagerly
i
search
their
faces
looking
now
for
the
horrid
marks
of
the
brute
triumphant
gloating
over
his
prey
but
the
brute
triumphant
is
not
there
for
these
thousands
of
germans
who
march
into
antwerp
on
this
historic
friday
are
characterised
by
an
aspect
of
dazed
incredulity
that
almost
amounts
to
fear
they
all
wear
pink
roses
or
carnations
in
their
coats
or
have
pink
flowers
wreathed
about
their
horses
harness
or
round
their
and
provision
motors
and
sometimes
they
burst
into
subdued
singing
but
it
is
obvious
that
the
enormous
buildings
of
antwerp
and
its
aspect
of
great
wealth
and
solidarity
fairly
take
away
their
breath
and
their
eyes
quite
plainly
say
chat
they
can
not
understand
how
they
come
to
be
in
possession
of
this
great
rich
wonderful
prize
they
look
to
left
and
right
their
blue
eyes
full
of
curiosity
as
i
watch
i
think
of
bismarck
remark
about
london
a
city
to
loot
that
same
thought
is
in
the
eyes
of
all
these
thousands
of
germans
as
they
come
in
to
take
possession
of
antwerp
and
they
suddenly
burst
into
song
pappachen
and
die
wacht
am
rhein
but
never
very
cheerily
or
very
loudly
do
they
sing
i
fancy
at
that
moment
experiencing
as
they
are
that
phase
of
naive
and
genuine
amazement
the
germans
are
really
less
brute
than
usual
and
then
just
as
i
am
thinking
that
i
meet
with
my
first
personal
experience
of
the
meaning
of
a
young
officer
has
espied
a
high
above
a
café
on
the
left
a
delighted
grin
overspreads
his
face
and
he
quickly
draws
his
companion
attention
to
it
together
the
two
gaze
smiling
at
the
homelike
words
their
blue
eyes
glued
upon
the
board
as
they
ride
along
the
contrast
between
their
gladness
and
that
old
belgian
agony
suddenly
strikes
through
my
heart
like
a
knife
the
pathos
and
tragedy
of
it
all
are
too
much
for
me
to
see
this
beloved
city
possessed
by
germans
is
too
terrible
yes
standing
there
in
the
beautiful
avenue
de
commerce
i
weep
as
if
it
were
london
itself
that
the
germans
were
coming
into
for
i
have
lived
for
long
unforgettable
weeks
among
the
belgians
at
war
and
i
have
learned
to
love
and
respect
them
above
all
peoples
and
so
i
stand
there
in
the
avenue
with
tears
rolling
down
my
cheeks
watching
the
passing
of
the
grey
uniforms
with
my
heart
all
on
fire
for
poor
ruined
belgium
then
looking
up
i
see
a
young
prussian
officer
laughing
at
me
mockingly
as
he
rides
by
he
laughs
and
looks
away
that
smart
young
uhlan
with
roses
in
his
coat
then
he
looks
back
and
laughs
again
and
rides
on
still
laughing
mockingly
at
what
he
takes
to
be
some
poor
little
belgian
weeping
over
the
destruction
of
her
city
to
me
that
is
an
act
of
brutality
that
small
as
it
may
seem
counts
for
a
barbarity
as
great
as
any
murder
germany
for
that
brutal
laugh
no
less
than
for
your
outrages
you
shall
pay
some
day
you
shall
surely
pay
chapter
xli
traitors
and
now
i
see
people
gathering
round
the
germans
as
they
come
to
a
halt
at
the
end
of
the
avenue
i
see
people
stroking
the
horses
heads
and
old
men
and
young
men
smiling
and
bowing
and
a
few
minutes
later
inside
the
restaurant
of
my
hotel
i
witness
those
extraordinary
encounters
between
the
germans
and
their
spies
i
hear
the
clink
of
gold
and
see
the
passing
of
big
german
notes
and
i
watch
the
flushed
faces
of
antwerp
men
who
are
holding
over
the
tables
to
the
german
officers
and
drinking
beer
with
them
to
the
accompaniment
of
loud
riotous
laughter
that
is
the
note
struck
in
the
first
hour
of
the
german
entrance
and
that
is
the
note
all
the
time
as
far
as
the
are
concerned
before
very
long
i
discover
that
there
must
have
been
hundreds
of
people
hiding
away
inside
those
silent
houses
waiting
for
the
germans
to
come
in
the
horror
of
it
makes
me
feel
physically
ill
the
procession
comes
to
a
standstill
at
last
in
front
of
a
little
green
square
by
the
athene
and
next
moment
a
group
of
officers
with
roses
in
their
tunics
are
hurrying
towards
the
hotel
and
begin
parleying
with
monsieur
claude
our
proprietor
i
expected
to
see
him
icily
resolute
against
receiving
them
but
to
my
surprise
he
seems
affable
he
smiles
he
waves
his
hand
as
he
talks
he
is
eager
deferential
and
quite
unmistakably
friendly
friendly
even
to
the
point
of
fawning
turning
he
flings
open
his
doors
with
a
bow
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
germans
are
crowding
into
his
great
restaurants
cries
of
bier
resounded
on
all
sides
outside
on
the
walls
of
the
theatre
flamand
the
huns
are
at
it

chapter
xlii
what
the
waiting
maid
saw
at
this
point
i
crept
down
stealthily
into
the
kitchen
and
proceeded
to
disguise
myself
i
put
on
first
of
all
a
big
check
apron
then
i
pinned
a
black
shawl
over
my
shoulders
i
parted
my
hair
in
the
middle
and
twisted
it
into
a
little
tight
knot
at
the
back
and
i
tied
a
handkerchief
under
my
chin
looking
thoroughly
hideous
i
slipped
back
into
the
restaurant
where
i
occupied
myself
with
washing
and
drying
glasses
behind
the
counter
it
was
a
splendid
point
of
observation
and
no
words
can
tell
of
the
excitement
i
felt
as
i
stooped
over
my
work
and
took
in
every
detail
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
restaurant
but
sometimes
the
glasses
nearly
fell
from
my
fingers
so
agonising
were
the
sights
i
saw
in
that
restaurant
at
antwerp
on
the
afternoon
of
october
the
fatal
friday
i
saw
old
men
and
young
men
crowding
round
the
germans
they
sat
at
the
tables
with
them
drinking
laughing
and
showing
their
which
the
germans
eagerly
examined
the
air
resounded
with
their
loud
riotous
talk
all
shame
was
thrown
aside
now
for
months
these
spies
must
have
lived
in
terror
as
they
carried
on
their
nefarious
espionage
within
the
walls
of
antwerp
but
now
their
terror
was
over
the
germans
were
in
possession
they
had
nothing
to
fear
so
they
drank
deeply
and
more
deeply
still
trying
to
banish
from
their
eyes
that
furtive
look
that
marked
them
for
the
sneaks
they
were
some
of
them
were
old
greybeards
some
of
them
were
chic
young
men
i
recognised
several
of
them
as
people
i
had
seen
about
in
the
streets
of
antwerp
during
those
past
two
months
and
again
and
again
burning
tears
gathered
in
my
eyes
as
i
realised
how
antwerp
had
been
betrayed
as
i
am
turning
this
terrible
truth
over
in
my
mind
i
get
another
violent
shock
i
see
three
englishmen
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
now
restaurant
at
first
i
imagine
they
are
prisoners
and
a
wave
of
sorrow
flows
over
me
for
i
know
those
three
men
they
are
the
three
english
marines
who
called
in
at
this
hotel
yesterday
seeing
that
they
were
englishmen
by
their
uniforms
i
called
to
them
to
keep
back
a
savage
dog
that
was
trying
to
get
at
the
cockatoo
that
i
had
rescued
from
lierre
they
told
me
they
were
with
the
rest
of
the
english
flying
corps
at
the
forts
their
english
had
been
perfect
never
for
a
minute
had
i
suspected
them
and
now
here
they
are
still
in
their
english
uniforms
and
little
english
caps
talking
german
with
the
germans
and
sitting
at
a
little
table
drinking
drinking
and
laughing
boisterously
as
only
germans
can
laugh
when
they
hold
their
spying
councils
english
marines
indeed
they
have
stolen
our
uniforms
somehow
and
have
probably
betrayed
many
a
secret
within
the
next
few
hours
i
am
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
antwerp
is
one
great
nest
of
german
spies
and
over
and
over
again
i
recognised
the
faces
of
old
men
and
young
men
whom
i
have
seen
passing
as
honest
antwerp
citizens
all
these
months
seated
all
by
himself
at
a
little
table
sits
a
belgian
general
who
has
been
brought
in
prisoner
in
his
sadness
and
dignity
he
makes
an
unforgettable
picture
his
black
beard
is
sunk
forward
on
his
chest
his
eyes
are
lowered
his
whole
being
seem
to
be
wrapt
in
a
profound
melancholy
that
yet
has
something
magnificent
and
distinguished
about
it
when
compared
with
the
riotous
elation
of
his
conquerors
nobody
speaks
to
him
he
speaks
to
nobody
with
his
dark
blue
cloak
flung
proudly
across
his
shoulder
he
remains
mute
and
motionless
as
a
statue
his
dark
eyes
staring
into
space
i
wonder
what
his
thoughts
are
as
he
sees
before
him
unashamed
and
unafraid
now
that
german
occupation
has
begun
these
spies
who
have
bartered
their
country
for
gold
but
whatever
he
thinks
that
lonely
prisoner
he
makes
no
sign
his
dignity
is
inviolable
his
dark
bearded
face
has
all
the
poignancy
and
beauty
of
titian
ariosto
in
the
national
gallery
in
london
he
is
a
prisoner
nobody
looks
at
him
nobody
speaks
to
him
nobody
gives
him
anything
to
eat
exhaustion
is
written
on
his
face
at
last
i
can
bear
it
no
longer
i
pour
out
a
cup
of
hot
coffee
and
take
a
sandwich
from
the
counter
then
i
slip
across
the
restaurant
and
put
the
coffee
and
the
sandwich
on
the
little
table
in
front
of
him
a
look
of
flashing
gratitude
and
surprise
is
in
his
dark
sad
eyes
as
they
lift
themselves
for
a
moment
but
i
dare
not
linger
the
flemish
maid
with
the
handkerchief
across
her
head
hurries
back
to
her
tumblers
two
little
priests
have
been
brought
in
as
prisoners
also
but
they
chat
cheerily
with
their
captors
who
look
down
upon
them
smilingly
showing
their
big
white
teeth
in
a
way
that
i
would
not
like
if
i
were
a
prisoner
none
of
the
prisoners
are
handcuffed
or
surrounded
they
do
not
seem
to
be
watched
they
are
all
left
free
so
free
indeed
that
it
is
difficult
to
realise
the
truth
one
movement
towards
the
door
and
they
would
be
shot
down
like
dogs
in
occupying
a
town
without
resistance
the
germans
make
themselves
as
charming
as
possible
obviously
those
are
their
orders
from
headquarters
and
germans
always
obey
orders
extraordinary
indeed
is
the
discipline
that
can
turn
the
brutes
of
louvain
and
aerschot
into
the
beings
that
took
possession
of
antwerp
they
asked
for
everything
with
marked
courtesy
even
gentleness
they
paid
for
everything
they
got
i
heard
some
of
the
poorer
soldiers
expressing
their
surprise
at
the
price
of
the
antwerp
beer
it
too
dear
they
said
but
they
paid
the
price
for
it
all
the
same
they
always
waited
patiently
until
they
could
be
served
they
never
grumbled
they
never
tried
to
rush
the
people
who
were
serving
them
in
fact
their
system
was
to
give
no
trouble
and
to
create
as
good
an
impression
as
possible
on
the
belgians
from
the
first
moment
of
their
entrance
the
first
moment
being
by
far
the
most
important
psychologically
as
the
terrified
brains
of
the
populace
are
then
most
receptive
to
their
impressions
of
the
hated
army
and
anything
that
could
be
done
to
enhance
and
improve
those
impressions
is
more
valuable
then
than
at
any
other
time
almost
the
first
thing
the
germans
did
was
to
find
out
the
pianos
it
was
not
half
an
hour
after
they
entered
antwerp
when
strains
of
music
were
heard
music
that
fell
on
the
ear
with
a
curious
shock
for
no
one
had
played
the
piano
here
since
the
belgian
government
moved
into
the
fortified
town
they
played
beautifully
those
germans
and
every
now
and
then
they
burst
into
song
from
the
in
the
hotel
i
heard
them
singing
to
the
blue
danube
and
the
wacht
am
rhein
seemed
to
come
and
go
at
intervals
like
a
leitmotif
to
all
their
doings
about
four
jeanette
the
flemish
servant
whispered
to
me
that
henri
wanted
to
speak
to
me
in
the
kitchen
a
great
misfortune
has
happened
madame
said
henri
agitatedly
the
germans
have
seized
my
car
i
shall
not
be
able
to
take
you
out
of
antwerp
this
afternoon
but
courage
i
will
find
a
cart
or
a
fiacre
it
is
impossible
to
do
anything
there
is
not
a
vehicle
of
any
kind
to
be
had
but
madame
trust
henri
he
will
get
you
away
never
fear
half
an
hour
after
the
faithful
fellow
called
to
me
again
his
face
looked
dark
and
miserable
the
germans
have
shut
the
gates
all
round
the
city
and
no
one
is
allowed
to
go
in
and
out
without
a
german
passport
he
said
this
was
serious
relying
on
my
experience
in
brussels
i
had
anticipated
being
able
to
get
away
even
more
easily
from
antwerp
because
of
henri
motor
car
but
obviously
for
the
moment
i
was
checked
as
dusk
fell
and
the
lights
were
lit
i
retired
into
the
kitchen
and
busied
myself
cutting
bread
and
butter
and
still
continuing
my
highly
interesting
observations
on
the
table
lay
piles
of
sausage
and
presently
in
came
two
german
officers
an
old
general
and
a
dashing
young
uhlan
lieutenant
we
want
three
eggs
each
said
the
uhlan
roughly
addressing
himself
to
me
three
eggs
soft
boiled
and
some
bread
with
butter
with
much
butter
i
nodded
but
dared
not
answer
and
the
young
lieutenant
thinking
i
did
not
understand
ground
his
heel
angrily
and
muttered
gott
when
his
eyes
fell
on
the
sausage
and
his
expression
changed
as
if
by
magic
wurst
he
ejaculated
to
the
general
here
there
sausage
is
it
was
quite
funny
to
see
the
way
these
two
gallant
soldiers
bent
over
the
sausage
their
eyes
beaming
with
greedy
joy
and
in
ten
minutes
every
german
was
crying
out
for
sausage
and
the
town
was
being
ransacked
in
all
directions
in
search
of
more
chapter
xliii
saturday
the
saddest
thing
in
antwerp
is
the
howling
of
the
dogs
thousands
have
been
left
shut
in
the
houses
when
their
owners
fled
and
all
day
and
night
these
poor
creatures
utter
piercing
desolate
cries
that
grow
louder
and
more
piercing
as
time
goes
on
it
is
saturday
morning
october
strange
things
have
happened
when
i
went
to
my
door
just
now
i
found
it
locked
from
the
outside
i
have
tried
the
other
door
that
is
locked
too
what
does
it
mean
i
wonder
here
i
am
in
a
little
room
about
twelve
feet
by
six
with
one
window
looking
on
to
the
back
wall
of
one
of
the
antwerp
theatres
i
can
hear
the
sounds
of
fierce
cannonading
going
on
in
the
distance
but
the
noise
within
the
hotel
close
at
hand
is
so
loud
as
to
deaden
the
sounds
of
battle
for
the
germans
are
running
up
and
down
the
corridors
perpetually
shouting
singing
stamping
and
the
pianos
are
going
too
nobody
comes
near
me
i
knock
at
both
the
doors
but
gently
for
i
am
afraid
to
draw
attention
to
myself
nobody
answers
the
old
woman
and
the
two
little
children
have
left
the
room
on
my
right
the
old
man
has
left
the
room
on
my
left
i
am
all
alone
in
this
little
den
i
dress
as
well
as
i
can
but
the
room
is
just
a
tiny
there
are
no
facilities
for
making
one
toilette
i
have
to
do
without
washing
my
face
instead
i
rub
it
with
crême
floreine
and
the
amount
of
black
that
comes
off
is
appalling
then
i
lie
down
at
full
length
on
my
mattress
and
wonder
what
is
going
to
happen
next
hour
after
hour
goes
by
in
a
corner
of
the
room
i
discover
an
english
weekly
history
of
the
war
and
lying
there
on
my
mattress
i
read
many
strange
stories
that
seem
somehow
to
mock
a
little
at
these
real
happenings
then
voices
just
outside
in
the
corridor
reach
me
out
there
two
old
belgians
are
talking
sont
les
anglais
qui
ne
veulent
pas
rendre
les
forts
says
one
they
are
discussing
the
fighting
which
still
goes
on
fiercely
in
the
forts
around
the
city
my
head
aches
i
am
hungry
and
those
big
guns
are
making
what
the
kaiser
would
call
world
noises
strange
thoughts
come
over
me
attacking
me
like
samson
deadly
swarm
of
hornets
armed
in
a
terrific
conflict
it
does
seem
to
matter
much
which
side
is
victorious
all
hatred
of
the
conquerors
dies
away
in
fact
the
conquerors
themselves
may
seem
like
deliverers
since
peace
comes
in
with
their
entrance
and
i
am
weak
and
weary
enough
at
this
moment
to
wish
would
give
it
up
let
the
forts
be
rendered
and
let
the
cannons
cease
anything
for
peace
for
an
end
of
slaughter
an
end
of
terror
an
end
of
this
cruel
thunder
terrible
thoughts
deadly
thoughts
do
they
come
to
the
soldiers
thoughts
like
these
heaven
help
the
poor
fellows
if
they
do
they
are
more
deadly
than
death
for
they
attack
only
the
immortal
part
of
one
leaving
the
mortal
to
save
itself
while
they
blight
and
corrode
the
spirit
i
am
weary
i
have
not
slept
for
five
nights
and
i
feel
as
if
i
shall
never
sleep
again
i
daresay
that
partly
why
i
have
been
weak
enough
to
wish
for
an
end
of
noise
it
five
and
darkness
has
set
in
nobody
has
been
near
me
i
still
here
locked
up
in
this
little
room
i
roam
about
like
a
caged
animal
i
look
from
the
window
the
blank
back
wall
of
the
antwerp
theatre
meets
my
eye
but
a
corner
of
the
hotel
looks
in
also
and
i
can
see
three
tiers
of
windows
so
i
hastily
move
away
in
all
those
rooms
there
are
germans
quartered
now
what
if
they
glanced
down
here
and
discovered
i
pull
the
curtains
over
the
window
and
move
back
into
the
room
this
is
saturday
afternoon
october
and
all
of
a
sudden
a
queer
thought
comes
over
me
october
is
my
birthday
i
lie
down
on
the
mattress
again
and
my
thoughts
begin
dreamily
to
revolve
round
an
extraordinary
psychic
mystery
that
i
became
conscious
of
when
i
was
little
more
than
a
baby
in
australia
i
became
conscious
at
the
age
of
four
that
i
heard
in
my
imagination
the
sounds
of
cannon
and
i
became
certain
too
that
those
cannon
were
going
to
be
real
cannon
some
day
yes
all
my
life
ever
since
i
could
think
i
have
heard
heavy
firing
in
my
ears
and
have
known
i
was
going
to
be
very
close
to
battle
some
day
or
other
have
other
people
been
born
with
the
same
belief
i
wonder
i
should
like
so
much
to
know
gradually
a
vast
area
of
speculative
psychology
opens
out
before
me
and
like
one
walking
in
a
world
of
dreams
i
lose
myself
in
its
dim
distances
seeking
for
some
light
clear
opening
wherein
i
can
discover
the
secret
of
this
extraordinary
psychic
or
physiological
mystery
that
has
hidden
itself
for
a
lifetime
in
my
being
i
say
hidden
itself
yet
though
it
has
kept
itself
dark
and
concealed
it
has
always
been
teasing
my
with
vague
queer
hints
of
its
presence
until
at
last
i
have
grown
used
to
it
and
have
even
arranged
a
fairly
comfortable
explanation
of
its
existence
between
my
soul
and
myself
i
have
told
myself
that
it
is
something
i
can
never
never
understand
and
that
it
is
all
the
explanation
i
have
ever
been
able
to
give
to
myself
of
the
presence
of
this
uninvited
guest
who
has
dwelt
for
a
lifetime
in
the
of
my
intuitions
who
has
hidden
there
veiled
and
mysterious
never
shewing
a
simple
feature
to
betray
itself
eye
lips
brow
always
remaining
unseen
unknown
uninvited
unintelligible
yet
always
potent
always
softly
disturbing
one
belief
in
one
ordinary
everyday
life
with
that
dull
roar
of
cannon
which
seemed
to
visualize
in
my
brain
with
an
image
of
blinding
sunlight
lying
there
on
the
bare
mattress
on
this
drear
october
day
which
goes
down
to
history
as
the
day
on
which
germany
set
up
her
governor
in
antwerp
i
begin
to
wonder
if
my
sublimable
consciousness
has
been
trying
all
these
years
to
warn
me
that
danger
would
come
to
me
some
day
to
the
sound
of
battle
and
am
i
in
that
danger
now
is
this
the
moment
perhaps
that
the
secret
silent
guest
has
tried
to
shew
me
lay
lurking
in
await
for
me
ready
to
make
me
fulfil
my
destiny
in
some
dark
and
terrible
way
no
i
ca
believe
it
i
ca
see
it
like
that
i
believe
that
that
is
what
the
roar
of
cannon
has
been
trying
to
say
to
me
all
my
life
i
ca
sense
danger
i
wo
no
i
mean
i
my
reason
assures
me
there
is
any
danger
that
is
going
to
me
no
matter
how
it
may
threaten
and
then
the
hornet
flies
to
the
attack
it
says
who
are
haunted
with
premonitions
nearly
always
disregard
them
until
too
late
so
occupied
am
i
with
these
dreams
and
philosophings
that
i
lie
there
in
the
darkness
forgetful
of
time
and
hunger
until
i
hear
voices
in
the
next
room
and
there
is
the
old
woman
opening
my
door
and
the
two
little
children
staring
in
at
me
curiously
the
old
woman
gives
me
some
grapes
out
of
a
basket
under
her
bed
and
a
glass
of
water
enfant
she
says
i
am
sorry
i
could
bring
you
no
food
but
the
germans
are
up
and
down
the
stairs
all
day
long
and
i
dare
not
risk
them
asking
me
who
is
that
for
but
why
are
you
so
afraid
i
ask
last
night
you
were
so
nice
to
me
what
has
happened
come
tell
me
the
truth
alors
madame
i
will
tell
you
you
recollect
that
german
who
leaned
over
the
counter
for
such
a
long
time
when
you
were
washing
glasses
yes
my
lips
felt
suddenly
dry
as
wood
alors
madame
he
said
to
me
that
fellow
never
speaks
who
did
he
mean
alors
madame
he
meant
you
this
then
i
think
to
myself
is
what
happens
to
one
when
one
is
really
frightened
the
lips
turn
dry
as
chips
and
all
because
a
german
has
noticed
me
it
is
absurd
i
force
a
smile
perhaps
you
imagine
this
i
said
no
because
he
said
to
me
is
that
mädchen
who
never
spoke
what
did
you
say
she
is
deaf
i
told
him
she
does
not
hear
when
anyone
speaks
to
her
so
that
is
why
you
locked
me
up
madame
it
was
my
brother
who
wished
it
he
is
very
afraid
and
now
madame
i
must
put
the
little
girls
to
bed
well
i
think
this
is
ridiculous
i
said
how
long
am
i
to
stay
here
she
shook
her
head
and
began
to
unfasten
little
black
serge
frock
pushing
her
out
of
my
room
as
she
did
so
with
the
evident
intention
of
locking
me
in
again
but
just
then
someone
knocked
at
the
outer
door
it
was
madame
who
came
stealing
in
drawing
the
bolt
noiselessly
behind
her
i
looked
in
her
weary
face
with
its
white
hair
and
beautiful
blue
eyes
and
saw
gentleness
and
sympathy
there
and
sincerity
she
said
mon
mari
has
been
talking
in
the
restaurant
with
a
friend
of
his
a
danish
doctor
a
red
cross
doctor
madame
you
understand
and
oh
he
is
so
sorry
for
you
madame
and
he
thinks
he
can
help
you
to
escape
he
wants
to
come
up
and
see
you
for
a
moment
i
advise
you
to
see
him
will
you
bring
him
up
i
said
immediately
the
old
patronne
went
on
undressing
the
little
girls
getting
them
hurriedly
into
bed
and
telling
them
to
be
quiet
they
kept
shouting
out
questions
to
me
and
whenever
they
did
so
their
grandmother
would
smack
them
silence
will
hear
you
but
they
were
terribly
naughty
little
girls
whenever
i
spoke
they
repeated
my
words
in
loud
mocking
voices
their
sharp
little
ears
told
them
of
my
foreign
accent
and
they
plucked
at
every
strange
note
in
my
voice
and
repeated
it
loud
and
shrill
but
the
grandmother
smacked
them
into
silence
and
pulled
the
bedclothes
up
over
their
faces
then
a
gentle
tap
and
madame
and
the
danish
doctor
came
stealing
in
ah
how
piercing
and
pathetic
was
the
look
i
cast
on
that
tall
stranger
i
saw
a
young
man
in
grey
clothes
with
blue
eyes
and
an
honest
english
look
quiet
kind
sincere
wearing
the
red
cross
badge
on
his
arm
i
looked
and
looked
then
i
told
myself
he
was
to
be
trusted
in
english
he
said
i
heard
there
was
an
english
lady
here
who
wants
to
get
away
from
antwerp
i
interrupted
sharply
please
do
speak
english
the
germans
are
always
going
up
and
down
the
corridor
they
may
hear
he
smiled
at
my
fears
but
immediately
changed
into
french
to
reassure
me
no
no
madame
you
must
be
alarmed
the
germans
are
too
busy
with
themselves
to
think
of
anything
else
just
now
and
i
want
to
help
you
your
queen
alexandra
is
a
dane
she
is
of
my
country
and
she
has
kept
the
bonds
very
close
and
strong
between
denmark
and
england
yes
if
only
for
the
sake
of
queen
alexandra
i
want
to
help
you
now
and
i
think
i
can
do
so
if
you
will
pass
as
my
sister
i
can
get
a
pass
for
you
from
the
danish
consul
and
that
will
enable
you
to
leave
antwerp
in
safety
may
i
see
your
papers
i
asked
him
now
i
am
sure
you
are
sincere
but
you
understand
that
i
would
like
to
see
your
papers
certainly
and
he
brought
out
his
papers
of
nationality
and
i
saw
that
he
was
undoubtedly
a
dane
working
under
the
red
cross
for
the
belgians
when
i
had
examined
his
papers
i
let
him
examine
mine
and
now
i
must
ask
you
one
thing
more
he
said
i
must
ask
for
your
passport
i
want
to
shew
it
to
my
consul
in
order
to
convince
him
that
you
are
really
of
british
nationality
will
you
give
me
your
passport
i
am
afraid
that
without
it
my
consul
may
object
to
do
this
thing
for
me
that
was
an
agonized
moment
i
had
been
told
a
hundred
times
by
a
hundred
different
people
that
the
one
thing
one
should
never
do
never
never
never
not
under
any
circumstances
was
to
part
with
passport
and
here
was
this
gentle
dane
pleading
for
mine
promising
me
escape
if
i
would
give
it
i
looked
up
at
him
as
he
stood
there
tall
and
grave
i
was
not
sure
of
him
and
why
because
he
had
spoken
english
and
i
still
thought
that
was
a
dangerous
thing
to
do
no
i
was
not
quite
sure
i
stood
there
breathless
stupefied
trying
to
think
madame
watched
me
in
silence
i
knew
that
i
must
make
up
my
mind
one
way
or
the
other
well
i
shall
trust
you
i
said
slowly
i
put
my
passport
into
his
hands
his
face
lit
up
and
i
watching
in
that
agony
of
doubt
told
myself
suddenly
that
he
was
genuine
that
was
real
gladness
in
his
eyes
ah
madame
i
thank
you
so
for
trusting
me
his
voice
was
moved
and
vibrant
he
bent
and
kissed
my
hand
then
he
put
the
passport
in
his
pocket
at
three
i
will
come
here
for
you
trust
me
absolutely
i
will
arrange
for
a
peasant
cart
or
a
fiacre
and
i
will
myself
accompany
you
to
the
dutch
borders
have
courage
you
will
soon
be
in
safety
ten
minutes
after
he
had
gone
monsieur
claude
burst
into
the
room
his
face
was
black
as
night
and
working
with
rage
what
is
this
you
have
done
he
cried
in
a
hoarse
voice
parle
avec
les
allemands
dans
le
restaurant
horrible
words
it
seems
to
me
that
as
long
as
i
live
i
shall
hear
them
in
my
ears
it
is
not
true
i
cried
it
be
true
he
is
talking
to
the
germans
in
the
restaurant
he
repeated
his
rage
was
undisguised
he
flung
on
the
table
a
little
packet
of
english
papers
that
i
had
given
him
to
hide
for
me
take
these
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
you
are
my
sister
affair
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
at
all
i
rushed
to
him
i
seized
him
by
the
arm
but
he
flung
me
off
and
left
the
room
in
and
out
of
my
brain
his
words
went
beating
in
and
out
in
and
out
the
thing
was
simple
clear
the
dane
had
gone
down
to
betray
me
and
he
had
all
the
evidence
in
his
hands
oh
fool
that
i
had
been
i
had
brought
this
on
myself
it
was
my
own
unaccountable
folly
that
had
led
me
into
this
trap
at
any
moment
now
the
germans
would
come
for
me
all
was
over
i
was
lost
they
had
my
passport
in
their
possession
i
could
deny
nothing
the
game
was
up
i
got
up
and
looked
at
myself
in
the
glass
the
habit
of
a
lifetime
asserted
itself
for
all
women
look
at
themselves
in
the
glass
frequently
and
at
unexpected
times
i
saw
a
strange
white
face
gazing
at
me
in
the
mirror
it
is
all
up
with
you
now
are
you
ready
for
the
end
prepare
yourself
get
your
nerves
in
order
you
can
not
hope
to
escape
it
is
either
imprisonment
or
death
for
you
what
do
you
think
of
that
and
then
at
that
point
kindly
mother
nature
took
possession
of
the
situation
and
sleep
rushed
upon
me
unawares
i
fell
on
the
mattress
and
knew
no
more
till
a
soft
knocking
at
my
door
awoke
me
and
i
saw
it
was
morning
a
light
was
filtering
in
dimly
through
the
window
blind
i
jumped
up
i
was
fully
dressed
having
fallen
asleep
in
my
clothes
madame
whispered
a
voice
open
the
door
toute
suite
it
was
the
old
woman
voice
i
pulled
away
the
barricading
chair
and
let
her
in
over
her
shoulder
i
saw
a
man
it
was
no
german
this
it
was
dear
henri
in
a
grey
suit
with
a
handkerchief
swathed
round
his
neck
behind
him
were
the
two
little
girls
quick
quick
breathes
the
old
woman
you
must
go
madame
you
must
go
at
once
my
brother
is
frightened
he
refuses
to
have
you
here
any
longer
he
is
terrified
out
of
his
life
lest
the
germans
should
discover
that
he
has
been
allowing
an
english
woman
to
hide
in
his
house
she
threw
an
apron
on
me
and
hurriedly
tied
it
behind
me
then
she
brought
out
a
big
black
shawl
and
flung
it
round
my
shoulders
then
she
picked
up
the
check
handkerchief
lying
on
the
table
and
nodded
to
me
to
tie
it
over
my
head
you
must
go
at
once
you
must
leave
everything
behind
you
you
must
not
take
anything
we
will
see
about
your
things
afterwards
you
must
pass
as
henri
wife
there
take
his
arm
and
you
henri
take
one
of
the
little
girls
by
the
hand
and
you
madame
you
take
the
other
there
courage
madame
oh
my
poor
child
i
am
sorry
for
you
she
kissed
me
and
pushed
me
out
at
the
same
time
next
moment
hanging
on
to
henri
arm
i
found
myself
outside
in
the
corridor
walking
towards
the
staircase
courage
whispered
henri
in
my
ear
suddenly
i
ceased
to
be
myself
i
became
a
peasant
i
was
henri
wife
these
little
girls
were
mine
i
leaned
on
henri
i
clutched
my
little
girl
fingers
close
i
felt
utterly
unafraid
i
thought
as
a
peasant
i
absolutely
precipitated
myself
into
the
woman
i
was
supposed
to
be
and
in
that
new
condition
of
personality
i
walked
down
the
wide
staircase
with
my
husband
and
my
children
passing
dozens
of
german
officers
who
were
running
up
and
down
the
stairs
continually
i
got
a
touch
of
their
system
they
moved
aside
to
let
us
pass
the
poor
little
peasant
his
anxious
wife
the
two
solemn
children
with
flowing
hair
the
hall
below
was
crowded
with
germans
i
saw
their
fair
florid
faces
their
grim
lips
and
blazing
eyes
but
i
was
a
peasant
now
a
little
belgian
peasant
reality
had
left
me
completely
fear
was
fled
the
sight
of
the
sunlight
and
the
touch
of
the
fresh
air
on
my
face
as
we
reached
the
street
set
all
my
nerves
acting
again
in
their
old
satisfactory
manner
courage
madame
whispered
henri
do
call
me
madame
call
me
louisa
i
whispered
back
where
are
we
going
to
a
friend
we
turned
the
corner
and
crossed
the
street
and
i
saw
at
once
that
antwerp
as
antwerp
has
entirely
ceased
to
exist
everywhere
there
were
germans
they
were
seated
in
the
cafés
flying
past
in
motor
cars
driving
through
the
streets
and
avenues
just
as
in
brussels
looking
as
if
they
had
lived
there
for
ever
voici
madame
muttered
henri
louisa
i
whispered
supplicatingly
chapter
xliv
can
i
trust
them
we
entered
a
café
i
shrank
and
clutched
his
arm
the
place
was
full
of
germans
but
they
were
common
soldiers
these
not
officers
they
were
drinking
beer
and
coffee
at
the
little
tables
take
no
notice
of
them
whispered
henri
you
are
all
right
trust
me
we
walked
through
the
restaurant
henri
and
i
arm
in
arm
and
the
little
girls
clinging
to
our
hands
they
really
played
their
parts
amazingly
those
little
girls
i
have
found
my
wife
from
brussels
announced
henri
in
a
loud
voice
to
the
old
proprietor
behind
the
counter
how
are
things
in
brussels
madame
queried
an
old
belgian
in
the
café
but
i
made
no
answer
i
affected
not
to
hear
i
went
with
henri
on
through
the
little
hall
at
the
far
end
of
the
café
next
moment
i
found
myself
in
a
big
clean
kitchen
and
a
tall
stout
woman
her
black
eyes
swimming
in
tears
was
leaning
towards
me
her
arms
open
oh
poor
madame
she
said
she
clasped
me
to
her
breast
between
her
tears
in
her
choking
voice
she
whispered
i
told
henri
to
bring
you
here
you
are
safe
with
me
we
are
from
luxemburg
we
fled
from
home
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
rather
than
see
our
state
swarming
with
prussians
as
it
is
now
we
luxemburgers
hate
germans
with
a
hate
that
passes
all
other
hate
on
earth
and
i
have
three
children
who
are
all
in
england
now
i
sent
them
there
a
week
ago
i
sold
my
jewels
my
all
to
let
them
go
i
know
my
children
are
safe
in
england
and
you
madame
you
are
safe
with
me
do
call
me
madame
call
me
louisa
and
call
me
ada
she
said
so
au
revoir
said
henri
i
shall
come
round
later
with
your
things
he
seized
the
little
girls
and
with
a
nod
and
courage
louisa
he
disappeared
oh
the
kindness
of
that
luxemburg
woman
her
poor
heart
was
bleeding
for
her
children
and
she
kept
on
weeping
and
asking
me
a
thousand
questions
about
england
while
she
made
coffee
for
me
and
spread
a
white
cloth
over
the
kitchen
table
what
would
happen
to
her
little
ones
would
the
english
be
kind
to
them
would
they
be
safe
in
england
and
over
and
over
again
she
repeated
the
same
sad
little
story
of
how
she
had
sent
them
away
her
three
beloveds
george
clare
and
little
ada
with
the
long
fair
curls
sent
them
away
out
of
danger
and
had
never
heard
a
word
from
them
since
the
day
she
kissed
them
and
bade
them
at
the
crowded
train
the
whole
of
that
day
i
remained
in
the
kitchen
there
at
the
back
of
the
café
i
could
hear
the
germans
coming
in
and
out
they
were
blowing
their
own
trumpets
all
the
time
telling
always
of
their
victories
ada
little
old
husband
would
walk
up
and
down
whistling
the
cheeriest
pipe
of
a
whistle
i
have
ever
heard
it
did
me
good
to
listen
to
him
it
brought
before
one
in
the
midst
of
all
this
terror
and
ruin
an
image
of
birds
at
six
that
day
when
dusk
began
to
gather
ada
shut
up
the
café
put
out
the
lights
and
she
and
her
old
husband
and
i
sat
together
in
the
kitchen
round
the
fire
presently
in
came
henri
with
my
little
bag
accompanied
by
madame
and
her
big
husband
and
two
enormous
yellow
dogs
they
told
me
that
the
danish
doctor
came
back
at
three
asked
for
me
and
was
told
i
had
gone
to
holland
if
it
were
not
for
the
danish
doctor
i
should
feel
quite
safe
i
said
was
he
angry
he
was
very
surprised
did
he
give
you
back
my
passport
no
did
he
get
the
passport
from
his
consul
he
said
so
did
he
want
to
know
how
i
got
away
he
said
he
hoped
you
were
safe
did
he
believe
you
i
do
know
do
you
he
believed
you
i
do
know
did
he
as
if
he
believed
you
he
looked
surprised
and
angry
a
little
annoyed
not
perhaps
and
surprised
yes
very
surprised
i
do
believe
that
he
believed
you
perhaps
not
perhaps
he
will
try
and
find
me
but
he
is
no
spy
answered
henri
if
he
had
wanted
to
betray
you
he
would
have
done
it
last
night
ça
agreed
the
others
what
did
you
know
about
him
i
asked
what
made
you
send
him
up
to
me
françois
surely
you
would
have
told
him
about
me
unless
you
he
was
trustworthy
ça
agreed
big
fat
françois
i
have
known
him
for
some
time
i
never
doubted
him
i
am
sure
he
is
to
be
trusted
he
has
worked
very
hard
among
our
wounded
but
why
did
he
speak
with
the
germans
in
the
restaurant
he
is
a
dane
he
can
speak
as
he
chooses
then
you
do
think
he
was
speaking
of
no
madame
évident
you
have
left
the
hotel
in
safety
perhaps
he
will
ask
monsieur
claude
where
i
am
monsieur
claude
will
tell
him
he
knows
nothing
about
you
has
never
seen
you
never
heard
of
you
perhaps
he
will
ask
monsieur
claude
sister
we
must
tell
her
not
to
tell
him
where
you
are
i
started
violently
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
have
warned
her
already
not
to
tell
him
where
i
really
gone
to
but
of
course
she
will
not
tell
him
she
is
devoted
to
you
madame
call
me
louisa
louisa
she
might
tell
him
to
get
rid
of
him
says
ada
slowly
ça
agree
the
others
thoughtfully
and
at
that
all
the
terror
of
last
night
returns
to
me
it
returns
like
a
but
it
is
troublous
all
the
same
and
then
opening
my
bag
to
inspect
its
contents
i
suddenly
see
a
big
strange
key
what
is
this
and
then
remembrance
rushes
over
me
it
is
the
key
that
lucien
arthur
jones
gave
me
the
key
of
the
furnished
house
in
antwerp
a
house
fully
furnished
and
fully
stored
with
food
and
no
occupants
and
no
germans
in
a
flash
i
decided
to
get
into
that
house
as
quickly
as
possible
it
was
the
best
possible
place
of
hiding
it
was
so
good
indeed
that
it
seemed
like
a
fairy
tale
that
i
should
have
the
key
in
my
possession
and
then
with
another
flash
i
decided
that
i
could
never
face
going
into
that
house
my
nerves
would
refuse
me
i
had
asked
a
good
deal
of
them
lately
and
they
had
responded
magnificently
but
they
turned
against
living
alone
in
an
empty
house
in
antwerp
quite
definitely
and
positively
they
turned
against
that
casting
a
swift
glance
about
me
i
took
in
that
group
of
faces
round
the
kitchen
fire
who
were
they
these
people
françois
and
lenore
henri
ada
and
the
little
old
man
whistling
like
a
bird
who
were
they
why
were
they
here
among
the
germans
why
had
they
not
fled
with
the
million
fugitives
was
it
possible
they
were
spies
for
i
knew
now
beyond
all
doubting
that
there
were
indeed
such
things
as
spies
though
the
english
mind
finds
it
almost
impossible
to
believe
in
the
reality
of
something
so
dedicated
to
the
gentle
art
of
making
melodrama
until
three
days
ago
i
had
never
seen
these
people
in
my
life
i
knew
absolutely
nothing
about
them
perhaps
they
were
even
now
carefully
drawing
the
net
around
me
perhaps
i
was
already
a
prisoner
in
the
germans
hands
and
yet
they
were
all
i
had
in
the
way
of
acquaintances
they
were
all
i
had
to
trust
in
could
i
trust
them
i
looked
at
them
again
it
was
strange
and
rather
wonderful
to
have
nothing
on
earth
to
help
one
but
one
own
judgment
then
ada
voice
reached
me
voici
louisa
she
is
saying
voici
le
photographie
de
mon
georges
and
she
bends
over
me
with
a
little
old
locket
and
inside
i
see
a
small
boy
fair
brave
little
face
and
ada
tears
splash
on
my
hand
i
sent
them
away
because
i
feared
the
alboches
might
harm
them
she
breaks
out
uncontrollably
for
mon
mari
and
myself
we
have
no
fear
and
we
had
not
money
for
ourselves
to
go
but
my
georges
and
my
clare
and
my
petite
ada
i
could
not
bear
the
thought
that
the
alboches
might
hurt
them
oh
mes
petites
mes
petites
they
wept
so
they
did
not
want
to
go
us
stay
here
with
you
mama
but
i
made
them
go
i
sold
my
bijoux
my
all
to
get
money
enough
for
them
to
go
to
england
oh
the
english
will
be
good
to
them
wo
they
louisa
tell
me
the
english
will
be
good
to
my
petites
sometimes
in
england
since
when
i
have
heard
some
querulous
suburban
english
heart
voicing
itself
grandiloquently
out
of
the
plethora
of
its
as
bit
fed
up
with
the
i
think
of
myself
with
a
passionate
sincerity
and
fanatic
belief
in
goodness
and
justice
assuring
that
weeping
mother
that
her
georges
and
clare
and
little
ada
with
the
long
hair
curls
would
be
cared
for
by
the
english
the
tender
generous
grateful
english
as
though
they
were
their
own
little
ones
even
better
perhaps
even
better
ada
tears
they
wash
away
my
fears
my
heart
melts
to
her
and
i
tell
her
straightway
about
the
house
in
the
avenue
but
how
splendid
she
cries
exuberantly
quel
chance
louisa
quel
chance
cries
lenore
morning
we
shall
all
take
you
there
declares
henri
their
surprise
their
delight
allay
my
last
lingering
doubts
but
mind
i
urge
them
feverishly
you
must
never
let
the
danish
doctor
know
that
address
that
night
i
sleep
in
a
in
a
room
at
the
top
of
dear
house
or
try
to
sleep
alas
it
is
only
trying
my
windows
look
on
a
long
narrow
street
a
dead
street
full
of
empty
houses
and
from
these
houses
come
stealing
with
louder
and
louder
insistence
the
sounds
of
those
imprisoned
dogs
howling
within
the
barred
doors
of
the
empty
houses
their
cries
are
terrible
they
are
starving
now
and
perishing
of
thirst
they
yelp
and
whine
and
wail
they
bark
and
shriek
and
plead
they
sob
they
moan
they
send
forth
cries
in
dozens
in
hundreds
from
every
street
from
every
quarter
these
massed
wails
go
up
into
the
night
lending
a
new
horror
to
the
dark
and
through
it
all
the
germans
sleep
they
make
no
attempt
either
to
destroy
the
poor
tortured
brutes
or
to
give
them
food
and
water
they
are
to
be
left
there
to
die
hour
after
hour
goes
by
i
bury
my
head
under
a
pillow
but
i
can
not
shut
out
those
awful
sounds
they
penetrate
through
everything
sometimes
they
are
the
dogs
are
giving
up
they
can
suffer
no
longer
they
understand
at
last
that
mankind
their
friend
who
has
had
all
their
faith
and
love
has
deserted
them
and
then
with
fresh
bursts
of
howling
they
seem
afresh
to
make
him
listen
to
make
him
realize
this
dark
and
terrible
thing
that
has
come
to
them
this
racking
thirst
and
hunger
that
he
has
been
so
careful
to
provide
against
before
even
as
though
they
were
his
children
his
own
little
ones
not
his
dogs
and
they
howl
and
cry
the
dead
city
listens
and
gives
no
sign
and
they
shiver
and
shriek
and
wail
but
in
vain
in
vain
it
is
the
most
awful
night
of
my
life
chapter
xlv
a
safe
shelter
next
morning
at
ten
lenore
and
i
and
the
henri
carrying
my
parrot
if
you
please
and
ada
strolled
with
affected
nonchalance
through
the
antwerp
streets
where
a
pale
gold
sun
was
shining
on
the
ruins
germans
were
everywhere
some
were
buying
postcards
some
sausages
motor
cars
dashed
in
and
out
full
of
grey
or
blue
uniforms
fair
grave
sardonic
faces
were
to
be
seen
now
where
only
a
few
brief
days
ago
there
had
been
naught
but
belgians
brave
eyes
and
lively
tender
physiognomy
our
little
party
was
silent
depressed
i
wore
a
handkerchief
over
my
head
tied
beneath
my
chin
a
big
black
apron
and
a
white
shawl
and
i
kept
my
arm
inside
henri
voici
madame
he
exclaimed
suddenly
voilà
les
anglais
et
les
anglaises
gasped
ada
under
her
breath
we
were
just
then
crossing
the
avenue
de
kaiser
that
once
gay
bright
belgian
avenue
where
i
had
so
often
walked
with
alice
my
dear
little
now
fled
alas
i
knew
not
where
a
procession
was
passing
between
the
long
lines
of
fading
acacias
a
huge
waggon
some
mounted
germans
two
women
oh
mon
dieu
says
ada
lying
on
sacks
in
the
open
waggon
are
wounded
english
officers
their
eyes
shut
and
trudging
on
foot
behind
the
waggon
with
an
indescribable
steadfastness
and
courage
is
an
english
nurse
in
her
blue
uniform
and
a
tall
thin
erect
english
lady
with
grey
hair
and
a
sweet
face
under
a
wide
black
hat
they
are
taking
them
to
germany
whispers
henri
in
my
ear
mon
dieu
mon
dieu
moans
ada
under
her
breath
oh
les
pauvres
anglaises
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
keep
from
flying
towards
them
an
awful
longing
came
over
me
to
speak
to
them
to
sympathise
to
do
something
anything
to
help
them
there
alone
among
the
germans
it
was
the
call
of
one
race
of
one
blood
of
one
country
but
it
was
madness
i
must
stand
still
to
speak
to
them
might
mean
bad
things
for
all
of
us
and
even
as
i
thought
of
that
the
group
vanished
round
the
corner
towards
the
station
as
we
walked
along
we
examined
the
city
ah
how
shocking
was
the
change
people
are
wont
to
say
of
antwerp
that
it
was
very
little
damaged
but
in
truth
it
suffered
horribly
far
beyond
what
anyone
who
has
not
seen
it
can
believe
the
burning
streets
were
still
on
fire
the
water
supply
was
still
cut
off
the
burning
had
continued
ever
since
the
bombardment
i
looked
at
the
hotel
antoine
and
shivered
a
few
days
ago
sir
frederick
greville
and
lady
greville
of
the
british
embassy
had
been
installed
in
that
hotel
and
countless
belgian
ministers
the
germans
had
tried
hard
to
shell
it
but
their
shells
had
fallen
across
the
road
instead
all
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
lay
flat
on
the
ground
smouldering
and
smoking
in
heaps
of
burning
ruins
at
last
we
reached
the
house
for
which
i
had
the
key
from
the
outside
it
was
dignified
handsome
thoroughly
belgian
standing
in
a
street
of
many
ruined
houses
trembling
i
put
the
key
into
the
lock
turned
it
and
pushed
open
the
door
then
i
gasped
open
sesame
indeed
for
there
stretching
before
me
was
a
magnificent
hall
richly
carpeted
with
broad
low
marble
stairs
leading
upwards
on
either
side
to
open
apartments
lined
with
rare
books
and
china
and
silver
we
crept
in
and
shut
the
door
behind
us
moving
about
the
luxurious
rooms
and
corridors
with
bated
breath
on
we
explored
no
fairy
tale
could
reveal
greater
wonders
here
was
a
superb
mansion
stocked
for
six
months
siege
in
the
cellars
were
huge
cases
of
white
wines
and
red
wines
and
mineral
waters
galore
in
the
pantries
we
found
hundreds
of
tins
of
sardines
salmon
herrings
beef
mutton
asparagus
corn
and
huge
bags
of
flour
boxes
of
biscuits
boxes
of
salt
sugar
pepper
porridge
jams
potatoes
at
the
back
was
a
garden
full
of
great
trees
and
grass
and
flowers
with
white
roses
on
the
agreeable
as
was
the
sight
there
was
yet
something
infinitely
touching
in
this
beautiful
silent
home
deserted
by
its
owners
who
secure
in
the
impregnability
of
antwerp
had
provided
themselves
for
a
six
siege
and
then
at
the
last
moment
their
hopes
crushed
had
fled
leaving
furniture
clothes
food
wines
everything
just
for
dear
life
sake
ada
wept
continually
as
she
moved
about
oh
the
poor
thing
she
sighed
every
now
and
then
and
forgetting
herself
and
her
own
grief
her
angel
heart
would
overflow
with
compassion
for
these
people
whom
she
had
never
seen
never
heard
of
until
now
for
the
first
time
for
days
i
felt
safe
and
when
lenore
madame
x
and
her
husband
promised
to
come
and
stay
there
with
me
and
bring
jeanette
and
the
old
grandmère
from
the
hospital
i
was
greatly
relieved
in
fact
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
danish
doctor
i
should
have
been
quite
happy
they
all
came
in
that
afternoon
and
henri
too
and
how
grateful
they
were
to
get
into
that
nest
we
quickly
decided
to
use
only
the
kitchen
and
lenore
and
her
husband
shewed
such
a
respect
for
the
beauties
of
the
house
that
i
knew
i
had
done
right
in
bringing
the
poor
refugees
here
through
the
barred
kitchen
windows
from
behind
the
window
curtains
we
watched
the
endless
rush
of
the
german
machinery
occasionally
germans
would
come
and
knock
at
the
door
and
lenore
would
go
and
answer
it
when
they
found
the
house
was
occupied
they
immediately
went
away
so
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
i
was
saving
that
house
from
the
huns
the
haunted
noontide
silence
of
my
solitary
walk
seemed
like
a
dream
now
noise
without
end
went
on
all
day
long
the
germans
were
rushing
their
machineries
through
the
chaussée
de
malines
or
rue
lamarinière
or
along
the
avenue
de
kaiser
at
some
of
the
monsters
that
went
grinding
along
one
stared
gasping
realising
for
the
first
time
what
petits
had
been
up
against
when
they
had
pitted
courage
and
honour
and
love
of
liberty
against
machinery
like
that
three
days
afterwards
along
the
road
from
lierre
two
big
guns
moved
on
locomotives
towards
aerschot
suggesting
by
their
vastness
that
immense
mountain
peaks
were
journeying
across
a
landscape
i
felt
physically
ill
when
i
saw
the
size
of
them
a
hundred
and
fifty
portable
kitchens
ensconced
in
motor
cars
also
passed
through
the
town
explaining
practically
why
all
the
germans
look
so
remarkably
motor
cycles
fitted
with
wireless
telegraphy
motor
loads
of
boats
in
sections
in
sections
and
trams
in
sections
dashed
by
eternally
the
swift
rush
of
motor
cars
seemed
never
to
end
yet
busy
as
the
germans
were
and
feverishly
concentrated
on
their
new
activities
they
still
found
time
to
carry
out
their
system
as
applied
to
their
endeavours
to
win
the
belgian
people
confidence
in
their
kindness
and
justice
as
conquerors
they
paid
for
everything
they
bought
food
lodging
drink
everything
they
asked
for
things
gently
even
humbly
they
never
grumbled
if
they
were
kept
waiting
they
patted
the
children
heads
over
and
over
again
i
heard
them
saying
the
same
thing
to
anybody
who
would
listen
we
love
you
belgians
we
how
brave
you
are
we
only
wanted
to
go
through
belgium
we
would
never
have
hurt
it
and
we
would
have
paid
you
for
any
damage
we
did
we
do
hate
the
french
either
they
are
the
french
but
the
and
here
a
positive
hiss
of
hatred
would
come
into
their
guttural
voices
the
are
false
to
it
was
they
who
made
the
war
it
is
all
their
fault
whatever
has
happened
we
did
want
this
war
we
did
all
we
could
to
stop
it
but
the
again
the
hiss
of
hatred
ringing
like
cold
steel
through
the
word
wanted
to
fight
us
they
were
jealous
of
us
and
they
used
you
poor
brave
belgians
as
an
excuse
that
was
always
the
beginning
of
their
litany
then
they
would
follow
the
chant
of
their
victories
and
now
we
are
going
to
calais
we
shall
start
the
bombardment
of
england
from
there
with
our
big
guns
before
long
we
shall
all
be
in
london
and
then
would
come
the
final
strain
which
was
often
true
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
addition
to
being
wily
i
left
my
good
home
behind
me
and
my
dear
good
wife
and
away
there
in
the
vaterland
i
have
seven
children
awaiting
my
return
so
you
can
imagine
if
and
men
like
me
wanted
this
war
it
was
generally
seven
children
sometimes
it
was
more
but
it
was
never
less
the
system
was
perfect
even
about
as
small
a
thing
as
that
chapter
xlvi
the
flight
into
holland
for
five
wild
incredible
days
i
remained
in
antwerp
watching
the
german
occupation
and
then
at
last
i
found
my
opportunity
to
escape
over
the
borders
into
holland
there
came
the
great
day
when
françois
managed
to
borrow
a
motor
car
and
took
me
out
through
the
breda
gate
to
putte
in
holland
to
ada
to
henri
to
lenore
jeanette
and
la
grandmère
i
knew
now
that
madame
could
be
trusted
to
the
death
she
had
proved
it
in
an
unmistakable
way
in
my
bag
i
had
her
belgian
passport
and
her
german
one
also
i
was
passing
now
as
françois
wife
the
photograph
of
lenore
stamped
on
the
passport
was
sufficiently
like
myself
to
enable
me
to
pass
the
german
sentinels
and
lenore
dear
sweet
lovable
lenore
had
coached
me
diligently
in
the
pronunciation
of
her
queer
flemish
name
which
was
lenore
of
course
as
for
my
own
english
passport
monsieur
went
several
times
to
the
young
danish
doctor
asking
for
it
on
my
behalf
the
dane
refused
to
give
it
up
how
do
i
know
said
he
that
you
will
restore
it
to
the
lady
illustration
the
danish
doctor
note
finally
monsieur
suggested
that
he
should
leave
it
for
me
at
the
american
consulate
eventually
long
after
it
came
to
me
in
london
from
the
american
consulate
with
a
note
from
the
dane
asking
them
to
see
that
i
got
it
safely
when
i
think
of
it
now
i
feel
sad
to
have
so
mistrusted
that
friendly
dane
what
did
he
think
i
wonder
to
find
me
suddenly
flown
perhaps
he
will
read
this
some
day
and
understand
and
forgive
ah
how
mournful
how
was
the
almost
incredible
change
that
had
taken
place
in
the
free
happy
country
of
former
days
and
this
ruined
desolate
land
of
as
we
flashed
along
towards
holland
we
passed
endless
villages
and
farms
magnificent
old
châteaux
shelled
to
the
ground
churches
lying
tumbled
forward
upon
their
graveyards
tombstones
uprooted
and
graves
riven
open
a
cold
wind
blew
the
sky
was
grey
and
sad
in
all
the
melancholy
and
chill
there
was
one
thought
and
one
alone
that
made
these
sights
endurable
it
was
that
the
poor
victims
of
these
horrors
were
being
cared
for
and
comforted
in
england
and
holland
big
warm
hearts
i
could
scarcely
believe
my
eyes
when
i
saw
on
the
dutch
borders
those
sweet
green
dutch
of
putte
stretching
away
under
the
peaceful
golden
evening
skies
trees
were
there
really
such
things
left
in
the
world
it
seemed
impossible
that
any
beauty
could
be
still
in
existence
and
i
gazed
at
the
woods
with
ravenous
eyes
drinking
in
their
beauty
and
peace
like
a
perishing
man
slaking
his
thirst
in
clear
cold
water
then
suddenly
out
of
the
depths
of
those
dim
dutch
woods
i
discerned
white
faces
peering
and
presently
i
became
aware
that
the
woods
were
alive
with
human
beings
white
gaunt
faces
looked
out
from
behind
the
faces
of
little
frightened
children
peeping
peering
wondering
faces
of
sad
hopeless
men
gazing
stonily
faces
of
women
who
had
turned
grey
with
anguish
when
that
cruel
hail
of
shells
began
to
burst
upon
their
little
homes
in
antwerp
drawing
them
in
their
terror
out
into
the
unknown
right
through
the
woods
of
putte
ran
the
road
to
the
city
of
and
along
this
road
i
saw
a
huge
military
car
come
flying
manned
by
half
a
dozen
dutch
officers
and
laden
with
thousands
of
loaves
of
bread
instantly
out
of
the
woods
out
of
their
secret
lairs
the
poor
homeless
fugitives
rushed
forward
gathering
round
the
car
holding
out
their
hands
in
a
passion
of
supplication
and
whispering
hoarsely
du
pain
du
pain
bread
bread
it
was
like
a
scene
from
dante
the
white
faces
the
outstretched
arms
the
sunset
above
the
wood
and
the
red
camp
fires
between
the
trees

friendly
holland
yesterday
i
was
in
holland
i
am
in
england
but
still
in
my
ears
i
can
hear
the
ring
of
scathing
indignation
in
the
voices
of
all
those
innumerable
dutch
when
i
put
to
them
the
question
that
has
been
causing
such
unrest
in
great
britain
lately
are
the
dutch
helping
germany
from
every
sort
and
condition
of
dutchmen
i
received
an
emphatic
never
the
people
of
holland
would
never
permit
it
and
in
holland
the
people
have
an
enormous
voice
nothing
could
have
been
more
emphatic
or
more
convincing
than
that
reply
but
i
pressed
the
point
further
is
it
not
true
then
that
the
dutch
allowed
german
troops
to
pass
through
holland
the
answer
i
received
was
startling
we
have
heard
that
story
and
we
can
not
understand
how
the
allies
could
believe
it
we
have
traced
the
story
my
informant
went
on
to
its
origin
and
we
have
discovered
that
the
report
was
circulated
by
the
germans
themselves
i
pressed
my
interrogation
further
still
would
it
be
correct
then
to
say
that
the
attitude
of
holland
towards
england
is
distinctly
and
unmistakably
friendly
among
all
sections
of
the
community
in
holland
my
informant
one
of
the
best
known
of
dutch
advocates
paused
a
moment
before
replying
then
seriously
and
deliberately
he
made
the
following
statement
in
the
upper
circles
of
dutch
society
that
is
to
say
in
court
circles
and
in
the
military
set
that
is
included
in
this
classification
there
has
been
it
is
true
a
somewhat
sentimental
partiality
for
germany
and
the
germans
this
preference
originated
obviously
from
prince
nationality
and
from
queen
wilhelmina
somewhat
passive
acceptance
of
her
husband
likes
and
dislikes
but
the
situation
has
lately
changed
a
new
emotion
has
seized
upon
holland
and
one
of
the
first
to
be
affected
by
this
new
emotion
was
prince
henry
himself
when
the
million
belgian
refugees
bleeding
starving
desperate
hunted
flung
themselves
over
the
dutch
border
in
the
agony
of
their
flight
we
dutch
and
prince
henry
among
us
saw
for
ourselves
for
the
first
time
the
awful
horror
of
the
german
invasion
and
so
the
prince
has
shewed
himself
sympathetic
towards
the
allies
he
has
devoted
himself
to
the
belgian
cause
was
the
reply
day
after
day
he
has
taken
long
journeys
to
all
the
dutch
cities
and
villages
where
the
refugees
are
congregated
he
has
visited
the
hospitals
everywhere
he
has
made
endless
gifts
in
the
hospitals
by
his
geniality
and
simplicity
he
completely
overcame
the
quite
natural
shrinking
of
the
wounded
belgian
soldiers
from
a
visitor
who
bore
the
hated
name
of
german
i
knew
it
was
true
too
because
i
had
myself
seen
prince
henry
going
in
and
out
of
the
hospitals
at
his
face
wearing
an
expression
of
deep
commiseration
but
what
about
england
i
went
on
hurriedly
how
do
you
feel
to
us
we
are
your
friends
came
the
answer
what
puzzles
us
is
how
england
could
ever
doubt
or
misunderstand
us
on
that
point
psychologically
we
feel
ourselves
more
akin
to
england
than
to
any
other
country
we
like
the
english
ways
which
greatly
resemble
our
own
just
as
much
as
we
like
english
manners
and
customs
we
dislike
the
manners
and
customs
of
germany
that
we
should
fight
against
england
is
absolutely
unthinkable
in
fact
it
would
mean
one
thing
only
in
holland
a
revolution
over
and
over
again
these
opinions
were
presented
to
me
by
leading
dutchmen
a
director
of
a
big
dutch
line
of
steamers
was
even
more
emphatic
concerning
holland
attitude
to
england
and
we
are
he
said
suffering
from
the
war
in
holland
suffering
badly
we
estimate
our
losses
at
per
cent
of
our
ordinary
trade
and
commerce
he
pointed
out
to
me
a
paragraph
in
a
dutch
paper
if
the
export
prohibition
by
britain
of
wool
worsted
is
maintained
the
manufactures
of
woollen
stuffs
here
will
within
not
a
very
long
period
perhaps
five
to
six
weeks
have
to
be
closed
for
lack
of
raw
material
a
proposition
of
the
big
manufacturers
to
have
the
prohibition
raised
on
condition
that
nothing
should
be
delivered
to
germany
is
being
submitted
to
the
british
government
we
hope
that
england
will
arrive
at
a
favourable
decision
you
know
i
said
tentatively
that
rumour
persists
in
attributing
to
holland
a
readiness
to
do
business
with
germany
let
me
be
quite
frank
about
that
said
the
director
thoughtfully
it
is
true
that
some
people
have
surreptitiously
been
doing
business
with
germany
but
in
every
community
you
will
find
that
sort
of
people
but
our
government
has
now
awakened
to
the
treachery
and
we
shall
hear
no
more
of
such
transactions
in
the
future
and
is
it
true
that
you
are
trying
to
change
your
national
flag
because
the
germans
have
been
misusing
it
it
is
quite
true
we
are
trying
to
adopt
the
ancient
standard
of
holland
the
orange
instead
of
the
red
white
and
blue
of
as
an
earnest
of
the
genuine
sympathy
felt
by
the
dutch
as
a
whole
towards
the
belgian
sufferers
i
may
describe
in
a
few
words
what
i
saw
in
holland
illustration
soup
for
the
refugees
out
of
the
black
horrors
of
antwerp
out
of
the
hell
of
bombs
and
shells
these
million
people
came
fleeing
for
their
lives
into
dutch
territory
penniless
footsore
bleeding
broken
with
terror
and
grief
dying
in
hundreds
by
the
way
the
inhabitants
of
antwerp
and
its
villages
crushed
blindly
onwards
till
they
reached
the
dutch
frontiers
where
they
flung
themselves
a
million
people
on
the
pity
and
mercy
of
holland
not
knowing
the
least
how
they
would
be
treated
and
what
did
holland
do
with
a
magnificent
simplicity
she
opened
her
arms
as
no
nation
in
the
history
of
the
world
has
ever
opened
its
arms
yet
to
strangers
and
she
took
the
whole
of
those
million
stricken
creatures
to
her
heart
the
dutch
at
where
the
majority
of
the
refugees
were
gathered
gave
up
every
available
building
to
these
people
they
filled
all
their
churches
with
straw
to
make
beds
for
them
they
opened
all
their
theatres
their
schools
their
hospitals
their
factories
and
their
private
homes
and
without
a
murmur
indeed
with
a
tenderness
and
gentleness
beyond
all
description
they
took
upon
their
shoulders
the
burden
of
these
million
victims
of
germany
brutality
it
is
our
duty
they
say
quietly
and
sick
and
poor
alike
pour
out
their
offerings
graciously
without
ceasing
in
the
grand
place
of
stand
long
lines
of
over
charcoal
fires
behind
the
line
of
are
stacks
of
bones
hundreds
of
bags
of
rice
and
salt
mountains
of
celery
and
onions
all
piled
on
the
flags
of
the
while
to
add
to
the
liveliness
and
picturesqueness
of
the
scene
dutch
soldiers
in
dark
blue
and
yellow
uniforms
ride
slowly
round
the
square
on
glossy
brown
horses
keeping
the
thousands
of
refugees
out
of
the
way
of
the
endless
stream
of
motor
cars
lining
the
grand
place
on
its
four
sides
all
packed
to
the
brim
with
bread
meat
milk
and
cheese
inside
the
town
hall
the
portrait
of
queen
wilhelmina
in
her
scarlet
and
ermine
robes
looks
down
on
the
strangest
scene
holland
has
seen
for
many
a
day
the
floors
of
the
hotel
de
la
ville
are
covered
with
thousands
of
big
red
dutch
cheeses
thousand
kilos
of
long
loaves
of
brown
bread
are
packed
up
almost
to
the
ceiling
looking
exactly
like
enormous
wood
stacks
sacks
of
flour
sides
of
pork
and
bacon
cases
of
preserved
meat
and
conserved
milk
hundreds
of
cans
of
milk
piles
of
blankets
piles
of
clothing
are
here
also
all
to
be
given
away
the
town
of
is
full
of
pictures
but
to
me
the
most
pathetic
of
all
is
the
writing
on
the
walls
it
is
a
tremendous
tribute
to
the
of
the
dutch
that
they
do
not
mind
their
scrupulously
clean
houses
defaced
for
the
moment
in
this
way
scribbled
in
white
chalk
all
over
the
walls
shutters
and
fences
windows
and
pavements
are
the
addresses
of
the
frenzied
refugees
trying
to
get
in
touch
with
their
lost
relations
on
the
trees
too
little
bits
of
paper
are
pinned
covered
with
addresses
and
messages
such
as
the
family
montchier
can
be
found
in
the
church
of
joseph
under
the
grand
altar
or
anna
decart
with
pierre
and
marie
and
grandmother
are
in
the
school
of
music
les
soeurs
martell
et
grandmère
are
in
the
church
of
the
holy
martyrs
la
famille
deminn
are
in
the
fifth
tent
of
the
encampment
on
the
artillery
ground
and
mme
ardige
and
their
seven
children
are
in
the
comedy
theatre
so
closely
are
the
walls
and
shutters
and
the
windows
and
trees
scribbled
over
by
now
that
the
million
addresses
are
most
of
them
becoming
indistinguishable
while
i
was
in
holland
i
came
across
an
interesting
couple
whom
i
speedily
classified
in
my
own
mind
one
was
a
dark
young
man
he
had
a
peculiar
accent
he
told
me
he
was
an
englishman
from
northampton
perhaps
he
was
he
said
the
reason
he
was
fighting
for
his
country
was
because
he
was
too
fat
perhaps
he
was
the
other
young
man
said
he
was
american
perhaps
he
was
he
had
red
hair
and
an
american
accent
he
had
lived
in
germany
a
great
deal
in
his
childhood
all
went
well
until
the
man
made
the
following
curious
slip
when
i
was
describing
the
way
the
germans
in
antwerp
fled
towards
the
sausage
he
said
how
they
will
roar
when
i
tell
them
that
in
berlin
swiftly
he
corrected
himself
in
new
york
i
mean
he
said
but
a
couple
of
hours
later
the
englishman
left
suddenly
for
london
and
the
american
left
for
antwerp
as
i
had
happened
to
mention
that
i
had
left
my
baggage
in
antwerp
i
could
quite
imagine
it
being
overhauled
by
the
germans
there
at
the
instigation
of
the
young
gentleman
with
the
pronounced
american
accent
a
rough
estimate
of
the
cost
to
the
dutch
government
of
maintaining
the
refugees
works
out
at
something
like
a
week
this
of
course
is
quite
irrespective
of
the
boundless
private
hospitality
which
is
being
dispensed
with
the
utmost
generosity
on
every
hand
in
rotterdam
haarlem
flushing
maasstricht
rossendal
delft
and
innumerable
other
towns
and
villages
some
of
the
military
families
on
their
meagre
pay
must
find
the
call
on
them
a
severe
strain
but
one
never
hears
of
complaints
on
this
score
and
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
they
refuse
absolutely
to
accept
payment
for
board
and
lodging
though
many
of
the
refugees
are
eager
to
pay
for
their
food
and
shelter
we
ca
make
money
out
of
them
is
what
the
dutch
say
a
new
reading
this
of
the
famous
couplet
of
a
century
ago
in
matters
of
this
kind
the
fault
of
the
dutch
was
giving
too
little
and
asking
too
much

french
cooking
in
war
time
there
is
no
more
belgium
to
go
to
so
i
am
in
france
now
but
are
not
wanted
here
they
are
driven
out
wherever
discovered
i
shall
not
stay
long
all
my
time
is
taken
up
in
running
about
getting
papers
my
bag
is
getting
out
of
shape
it
bulges
with
the
laisser
passers
and
sauf
conduits
that
one
has
to
fight
so
hard
to
get
however
to
be
among
people
again
is
a
great
joy
and
in
dunkirk
it
has
refreshed
and
consoled
me
greatly
to
see
madame
piers
cooking
the
old
frenchwoman
moved
about
her
tiny
kitchen
her
infinitesimally
tiny
kitchen
and
i
watched
her
from
my
point
of
observation
seated
on
a
tiny
chair
at
a
tiny
table
squeezed
up
into
a
tiny
corner
it
really
was
the
smallest
kitchen
i
ever
seen
no
you
could
have
swung
a
cat
in
it
you
really
could
and
no
one
but
a
thrifty
french
housewife
could
have
contrived
to
get
that
wee
round
table
and
little
chair
into
that
tiny
angle
yet
i
felt
very
cosy
and
comfortable
there
and
the
old
french
mother
preparing
supper
for
her
household
and
for
any
soldier
who
might
be
passing
by
seemed
perfectly
satisfied
with
her
cramped
surroundings
and
kept
begging
me
graciously
to
remain
where
i
was
drinking
the
hot
tea
she
had
just
made
for
me
while
my
boots
that
were
always
wet
out
there
dried
under
her
big
charcoal
stove
and
always
she
smiled
away
and
i
smiled
too
who
could
help
it
she
and
her
kitchen
were
the
most
charming
study
imaginable
every
now
and
then
her
fine
old
brown
thin
wrinkled
hand
would
reach
over
my
head
for
a
pot
or
a
brush
or
a
pan
from
the
wall
behind
or
the
shelf
above
me
while
the
other
hand
would
stir
or
shake
something
over
the
wee
or
the
charcoal
stove
for
so
small
was
the
kitchen
that
by
stretching
she
could
reach
at
the
same
time
to
the
wall
on
either
side
then
she
began
to
pick
over
a
pile
of
green
stuff
very
much
like
that
we
in
england
should
contemptuously
call
weeds
pick
pick
pick
a
diamond
merchant
with
his
jewels
could
not
have
been
more
careful
more
delicate
more
watchful
and
as
i
thought
that
it
suddenly
came
over
me
that
to
this
old
careful
thrifty
frenchwoman
those
weedy
greens
were
not
weeds
at
all
but
were
really
as
precious
as
diamonds
for
she
was
a
frenchwoman
clever
and
disciplined
in
the
art
of
thrift
and
they
represented
the
most
important
thing
in
all
the
world
food
food
means
life
food
means
victory
food
means
the
end
of
the
war
and
peace
you
could
read
all
that
in
her
black
intelligent
eyes
then
i
began
to
sit
up
and
watch
her
more
closely
still
when
she
had
picked
off
all
those
little
hard
leaves
she
cracked
up
the
bare
harsh
stalks
into
pieces
an
inch
long
and
flung
them
all
leaves
and
stalks
into
a
saucepan
of
boiling
water
which
she
presently
pushed
aside
to
let
simmer
away
gently
for
ten
minutes
or
so
meanwhile
she
is
carefully
peeling
a
egg
taking
the
shell
off
in
two
pieces
and
shredding
up
the
white
on
a
little
white
saucer
never
losing
a
crumb
of
it
even
an
egg
why
waste
an
egg
like
that
but
indeed
she
is
not
going
to
waste
it
she
is
using
the
yolk
to
make
mayonnaise
sauce
and
the
white
is
for
decoration
later
on
with
all
her
thrift
she
must
have
things
pretty
her
cheap
dishes
must
have
an
air
of
finish
an
artistic
touch
and
she
knows
and
acts
up
to
the
fact
that
the
yellow
and
white
egg
is
not
wasted
but
returns
a
hundred
per
because
it
is
going
to
make
her
supper
look
a
hundred
times
more
important
than
it
really
is
now
she
takes
the
greens
from
the
saucepan
drains
them
and
puts
them
into
a
little
on
the
big
stove
and
she
peppers
and
salts
them
and
turns
them
about
and
leaves
them
with
a
little
smile
she
always
has
that
little
smile
for
everything
and
i
think
that
goes
into
the
flavour
somehow
and
now
she
pours
the
water
the
greens
were
boiled
in
into
that
big
on
the
big
stove
and
gives
the
soup
a
friendly
stir
just
to
shew
that
she
has
forgotten
it
she
opens
the
cupboard
and
brings
out
every
little
or
big
bit
of
bread
left
over
from
lunch
and
breakfast
and
she
shapes
them
a
little
with
her
sharp
old
knife
and
she
hurries
them
all
into
the
big
pot
putting
the
lid
down
quickly
so
that
even
the
steam
does
get
out
and
get
wasted
now
she
takes
the
greens
off
the
fire
and
puts
them
into
a
dear
little
round
white
china
dish
and
leaves
them
to
get
cold
she
opens
her
cupboard
again
and
brings
out
a
piece
of
cold
veal
cutlet
and
a
piece
of
cold
steak
left
over
from
luncheon
yesterday
and
also
what
is
she
going
to
do
with
these
she
is
going
to
make
them
our
special
dish
for
supper
she
begins
to
shred
them
up
with
her
old
sharp
blade
shreds
them
up
finely
not
mincing
not
chopping
but
shredding
the
particles
apart
and
into
them
she
shreds
a
little
cold
ham
and
onion
and
then
she
flavours
it
well
with
salt
and
pepper
then
she
piles
this
all
on
a
dish
and
covers
it
with
golden
mayonnaise
and
it
with
long
red
wires
of
beetroot
the
greens
are
cold
now
and
she
dresses
them
she
oils
them
and
vinegars
them
and
pats
and
arranges
them
and
decorates
them
with
the
white
of
the
chopped
egg
and
thin
little
slices
of
tomato
voilà
the
salad
she
says
with
her
flash
of
a
smile
salad
for
five
people
a
beautiful
tasty
green
melting
delicious
salad
that
might
have
been
made
of
young
asparagus
tips
and
what
did
it
cost
one
farthing
plus
the
labour
and
care
and
affection
and
time
that
the
old
woman
put
into
the
making
of
it
plus
in
other
words
her
thrift
now
she
must
empty
my
does
she
turn
it
upside
down
over
a
bucket
of
rubbish
as
they
do
in
england
leaving
the
to
go
to
the
dustman
when
he
calls
on
friday
she
would
think
that
an
absolutely
wicked
thing
to
do
if
she
had
ever
heard
of
such
proceedings
but
she
has
not
she
drains
every
drop
of
tea
into
a
jug
puts
a
lid
on
it
and
places
it
away
in
her
safe
then
she
empties
the
into
a
yellow
earthenware
basin
and
puts
a
plate
over
them
and
puts
them
up
on
a
shelf
i
begin
to
say
to
myself
with
quite
an
excited
feeling
shall
i
ever
see
her
throw
anything
away
potatoes
next
ah
now
there
be
peelings
and
those
she
have
to
throw
away
not
a
bit
of
it
there
are
only
the
very
thinnest
filmiest
scrapings
of
dark
down
off
this
old
dear
potatoes
and
suddenly
i
think
of
poor
dear
england
where
our
potato
skins
are
so
thick
that
a
tradition
has
grown
from
them
and
the
maids
throw
them
over
their
shoulders
and
see
what
letter
they
make
on
the
floor
and
that
will
be
the
first
letter
of
name
laughing
i
tell
of
this
tradition
to
my
old
frenchwoman
and
what
do
you
think
she
answers
the
skin
must
be
very
thick
not
to
break
she
says
solemnly
but
then
you
english
are
all
so
rich
are
we
or
are
we
simply
what
is
it
that
bluntly
put
we
are
lazy
after
the
fall
of
antwerp
when
a
million
people
had
fled
into
holland
i
saw
ladies
in
furs
and
jewels
holding
up
beseeching
imploring
hands
to
the
kindly
but
bewildered
dutch
folk
asking
for
bread
just
bread
it
was
a
terrible
sight
but
shall
we
too
be
begging
for
bread
some
day
shall
we
too
be
longing
for
the
pieces
we
threw
away
who
knows
finally
we
sat
down
to
an
exquisite
supper
first
there
was
croûte
au

the
nicest
soup
in
the
world
said
a
king
of
france
and
full
of
nourishment
then
there
was
a
small
slice
each
of
tender
juicy
boiled
beef
out
of
the
big
never
betraying
for
a
minute
that
that
beautiful
soup
had
been
made
from
it
with
that
beef
went
the
potatoes
sautée
in
butter
and
sprinkled
with
chopped
green
after
that
came
the
chicken

and

the
rain
had
ceased
the
peace
of
god
was
drifting
down
like
a
wing
over
the
tortured
world
from
the
city
of
dunkirk
a
mile
beyond
the
plage
the
chimes
of
sabbath
bells
stole
out
soothingly
and
little
frenchwomen
passed
with
prayer
books
and
eyes
down
bent
it
was
sunday
morning
and
for
the
first
time
in
this
new
year
religion
and
spring
were
met
in
the
golden
beauty
of
a
day
that
was
windswept
and
sunlit
simultaneously
and
that
swept
away
like
magic
the
sad
depression
of
endless
grey
monotonous
days
of
rain
and
mud
and
then
all
suddenly
a
change
came
sweeping
over
the
golden
beach
and
the
turquoise
skies
overhead
and
all
the
fair
glory
of
the
glittering
morning
turned
with
a
crash
into
tragedy
crash
crash
bewildered
not
understanding
i
heard
one
deafening
intonation
after
another
fling
itself
fiercely
from
the
cannons
that
guard
the
port
and
city
of
dunkirk
then
followed
the
shouts
of
fishermen
soldiers
nurses
and
the
motley
handful
of
people
who
happened
to
be
on
the
beach
just
then
everybody
began
shouting
and
everybody
began
running
and
pointing
towards
the
sky
and
then
i
saw
the
commencement
of
the
most
extraordinary
sight
this
war
has
witnessed
an
english
aeroplane
was
chasing
a
german
taube
that
had
suddenly
appeared
above
the
the
german
was
doing
his
best
to
make
a
rush
for
dunkirk
and
the
englishman
was
doing
his
best
to
stop
him
as
i
watched
i
held
my
breath
the
english
aeroplane
came
on
fiercely
and
mounted
with
a
swift
rush
till
it
gained
a
place
in
the
bright
blue
skies
above
the
little
taube
it
seemed
that
the
english
aviator
must
now
get
the
better
of
his
foe
but
suddenly
with
an
incredible
swiftness
the
german
doubled
and
giving
up
his
attempt
to
get
across
the
city
fled
eastwards
like
a
mad
thing
with
the
englishman
after
him
but
now
one
saw
that
the
german
machine
responded
more
quickly
and
had
far
the
better
of
it
as
regards
pace
leaving
the
pursuing
englishman
soon
far
behind
it
and
rushing
away
across
the
skies
at
a
really
incredible
rate
but
while
this
little
thrilling
byplay
was
engaging
the
attention
of
everyone
far
greater
things
were
getting
in
train
another
taube
was
sneaking
unobserved
among
the
clouds
and
was
rapidly
gaining
a
place
high
up
above
dunkirk
and
now
it
lets
fall
a
bomb
that
drops
down
down
into
the
town
beneath
immediately
with
a
sound
like
the
splitting
of
a
million
worlds
everything
and
everyone
opens
fire
french
english
belgians
and
all
the
whole
earth
seems
to
have
gone
mad
up
into
the
sky
they
are
all
firing
up
into
the
brilliant
golden
sunlight
at
that
little
black
creature
that
spits
out
venomously
every
two
or
three
minutes
black
bombs
that
go
slitting
through
the
air
with
a
faint
screech
till
they
touch
the
earth
and
shed
death
and
destruction
all
around
and
now
what
this
all
along
the
shore
slipping
and
sailing
along
across
the
sky
comes
into
sight
an
endless
succession
of
taubes
they
glitter
like
silver
in
the
sunlight
defying
all
the
efforts
of
the
french
artillery
they
sail
along
with
a
calm
insouciance
that
nearly
drives
me
mad
crash
crash
crash
bang
bang
bang
the
cannon
and
the
rifles
are
at
them
now
with
a
fury
that
defies
all
words
the
firing
comes
from
all
directions
they
are
firing
inland
and
they
are
firing
out
to
sea
at
last
i
run
into
a
house
with
some
french
soldiers
who
are
clenching
their
hands
with
rage
at
that
behaviour
one
two
three
four
five
six
seven
eight
nine
ten
everyone
is
counting
eleven
twelve
thirteen
fourteen
fifteen
sixteen
voilà
un
autre
cry
the
french
soldiers
every
minute
they
utter
groans
of
rage
and
disgust
the
glittering
cavalcade
sails
serenely
onward
until
the
whole
from
right
to
left
above
the
beach
is
dotted
with
those
sparkling
creatures
now
outlined
against
the
deep
plentiful
blue
of
the
sky
and
now
gliding
and
hiding
beneath
some
vast
soft
drift
of
feathery
cloud
it
is
a
sight
never
to
be
forgotten
its
beauty
is
so
vivid
so
thrilling
that
it
is
difficult
to
realise
that
this
lovely
spectacle
of
a
race
across
the
sky
is
no
game
no
race
no
exhibition
but
represents
the
ultimate
end
of
all
the
races
and
prizes
and
exhibitions
and
attempts
to
fly
here
is
the
whole
art
of
flying
in
a
tabloid
as
it
were
with
all
its
significance
at
last
in
evidence
the
silver
aeroplanes
over
the
sea
keep
guard
all
the
time
moving
along
very
very
slowly
and
very
high
up
until
the
taube
has
dropped
its
last
bomb
over
the
city
then
they
glide
away
across
the
sea
in
the
direction
of
england
i
walked
back
to
the
city
what
a
change
since
i
came
through
it
an
hour
or
so
before
i
looked
at
the
hotel
de
ville
and
shuddered
all
the
windows
were
smashed
and
just
at
the
side
in
a
tiny
green
square
was
the
great
hole
that
showed
where
the
bomb
had
fallen
harmlessly
all
the
afternoon
the
audacious
taube
remained
rushing
about
high
above
dunkirk
but
later
that
afternoon
as
i
was
in
a
train
en
route
for
fumes
fate
threw
in
my
way
the
chance
to
see
a
glorious
vindication
the
train
was
brought
suddenly
to
a
standstill
we
all
jumped
up
and
looked
out
it
was
getting
dusk
but
against
the
red
in
the
sky
two
black
things
were
visible
one
dropped
a
bomb
intended
for
the
railway
station
a
little
further
on
by
that
we
knew
it
was
german
but
we
had
little
time
to
think
the
other
aeroplane
rushed
onwards
firing
was
heard
and
down
came
the
german
followed
by
the
frenchman
they
alighted
almost
side
by
side
we
could
see
quite
plainly
men
getting
out
and
rushing
towards
each
other
a
few
minutes
later
some
peasants
came
rushing
to
tell
us
that
the
two
germans
from
the
taube
both
lay
dead
on
the
edge
of
that
sandy
field
to
westward
then
our
train
went
on
chapter
l
the
war
bride
the
train
went
on
it
was
dark
quite
dark
when
i
got
out
of
it
ac
last
and
looked
about
me
blinking
this
was
right
at
the
front
in
flanders
and
a
long
cavalcade
of
french
soldiers
were
alighting
also
two
handsome
elderly
turcos
with
splendid
eyes
black
beards
and
strange
hard
faces
passed
looking
immensely
distinguished
as
they
mounted
their
arab
horses
and
rode
off
into
the
night
swathed
in
their
white
with
their
flowing
picturesque
cloaks
spread
out
over
their
horses
tails
their
swords
clanking
at
their
sides
and
their
blazing
eyes
full
of
queer
bold
pride
then
to
my
great
surprise
i
see
coming
out
of
the
station
two
ladies
wrapped
in
furs
a
young
lady
and
an
old
one
delightful
i
think
to
myself
as
i
come
up
with
them
i
hear
them
enquiring
of
a
sentinel
the
way
to
the
hotel
de
noble
rose
and
with
the
swift
friendliness
of
war
time
i
stop
and
ask
if
i
may
walk
along
with
them
je
suis
anglais
i
add
avec
beaucoup
de
plaisir
they
cry
simultaneously
we
are
just
arrived
from
folkestone
the
younger
one
explains
in
pretty
broken
english
as
we
grope
our
way
along
the
cobbled
road
ah
but
what
a
journey
but
her
voice
bubbles
as
she
speaks
and
though
i
can
not
see
her
face
i
suddenly
become
aware
that
for
some
reason
or
other
this
girl
is
filled
with
quite
extraordinary
happiness
picking
our
way
along
the
road
in
the
dark
with
the
cannons
growling
away
fiercely
some
six
miles
off
she
tells
me
her
petite
histoire
she
is
a
little
brussels
bride
in
search
of
her
soldier
bridegroom
and
she
has
by
dint
of
persistent
coaxing
persuaded
her
old
mother
to
set
out
from
brussels
all
this
long
long
way
through
antwerp
to
holland
then
to
flushing
then
to
folkestone
then
to
calais
then
to
dunkirk
and
finally
here
to
the
front
where
her
soldier
bridegroom
will
be
found
he
is
here
he
has
been
wounded
he
is
better
he
has
always
said
no
no
you
must
not
come
and
now
at
last
he
had
said
come
and
here
she
is
she
is
so
pretty
so
simple
so
girlish
and
sweet
and
the
mother
is
such
a
perfect
old
duck
of
a
mother
that
i
fall
in
love
with
them
both
presently
we
find
ourselves
in
the
quaint
old
flemish
inn
with
oil
lamps
and
dark
beams
the
stout
landlord
hastens
forward
have
you
a
message
for
madame
louis
the
bride
gasps
out
her
question
oui
oui
madame
the
landlord
answers
heartily
there
is
a
message
for
you
you
are
to
wait
here
that
is
the
message
bien
her
eyes
flame
with
joy
so
we
order
coffee
and
sit
at
a
little
table
chattering
away
but
i
confess
that
all
i
want
is
to
watch
that
young
girl
pale
dark
face
rays
of
light
keep
illuminating
it
making
it
almost
divinely
beautiful
and
it
seems
to
me
i
have
never
come
so
close
before
to
another
human
being
joy
and
then
a
soldier
walks
in
he
comes
towards
her
she
springs
to
her
feet
he
utters
a
word
he
is
telling
her
her
husband
is
out
in
the
passage
very
wonderful
is
the
way
that
girl
gets
across
the
big
smoky
flemish
café
i
declare
she
scarcely
touches
the
ground
it
is
as
near
flying
as
anyone
human
could
come
then
she
is
through
the
door
and
we
see
no
more
ah
but
we
can
imagine
it
we
two
the
old
mother
and
i
and
we
look
at
each
other
and
her
eyes
are
wet
and
so
are
mine
and
we
smile
but
very
mistily
very
shakily
at
the
thought
of
those
two
in
the
little
narrow
passage
outside
clasped
in
each
others
arms
they
come
in
presently
they
sit
with
us
now
the
dear
things
sit
hand
in
hand
and
their
young
faces
are
almost
too
sacred
to
look
at
so
dazzling
is
the
joy
written
in
both
his
and
hers
they
are
bathed
in
smiles
that
keep
breaking
over
their
lips
and
eyes
like
breakers
on
a
summer
strand
and
everything
they
say
ends
in
a
broken
laugh
and
then
we
go
into
dinner
and
they
make
me
dine
with
them
and
they
order
red
wine
and
make
me
have
some
and
i
cease
to
be
a
stranger
i
become
an
old
friend
intermingling
with
that
glorious
happiness
which
seems
to
be
mine
as
well
as
theirs
because
they
are
lovers
and
love
all
the
world
the
old
mother
whispers
to
me
softly
when
she
got
a
chance
he
will
be
so
pleased
when
he
knows
there
a
little
one
coming
oh
wonderful
little
one
i
whisper
back
she
understands
and
nods
between
tears
and
smiles
again
while
the
two
divine
ones
sit
gazing
at
the
paradise
in
each
other
eyes
and
through
it
all
all
the
time
goes
on
the
hungry
growl
of
cannons
and
just
a
few
miles
out
continue
all
the
time
those
wild
and
passionate
struggles
for
life
and
death
between
the
allies
and
germans
which
soon
god
in
his
mercy
forbid
may
fling
this
smiling
boy
out
into
the
sad
dark
glory
of
death
on
the
leaving
his
little
one
fatherless
ah
but
with
what
a
heritage
and
then
all
suddenly
i
think
to
myself
who
would
not
be
glad
and
proud
to
come
to
life
under
such
epic
happenings
such
glorious
heroic
beginnings
with
all
that
is
commonplace
and
worldly
left
out
and
all
that
is
stirring
and
deep
and
vital
put
in
never
in
the
history
of
the
world
have
there
been
as
many
marriages
as
now
everywhere
girls
and
men
are
marrying
no
longer
do
they
hesitate
and
ponder
and
hang
back
instead
they
rush
towards
each
other
eagerly
confidentially
right
into
each
others
arms
into
each
lives
till
death
us
do
part
say
those
thousands
of
brave
young
voices
indeed
it
seems
to
me
that
never
in
the
history
of
this
old
old
world
was
love
as
wonderful
as
now
each
bride
is
a
heroine
and
oh
the
hero
that
every
bridegroom
is
they
snatch
at
happiness
they
discover
now
in
one
swift
instant
what
philosophers
have
spent
years
in
teaching
that
life
is
fleeting
and
they
are
afraid
to
lose
one
of
the
golden
moments
which
may
so
soon
come
to
an
end
for
ever
but
that
is
not
all
there
is
something
else
behind
it
all
something
no
less
beautiful
though
less
personal
there
is
the
intention
of
the
race
to
survive
consciously
sometimes
but
more
often
unconsciously
our
men
and
our
women
are
mating
for
the
sake
of
the
generation
that
will
follow
the
children
who
will
rise
up
and
call
them
blessed
the
brave
strong
wonderful
children
begotten
of
brave
sweet
women
who
joyously
took
all
risks
and
splendid
heroic
men
with
hearts
soft
with
love
and
pity
for
the
women
they
left
behind
but
with
iron
determination
steeling
their
souls
to
fight
to
the
death
for
their
country
how
superb
will
be
the
coming
generation
begotten
under
such
glorious
circumstances
with
nothing
missing
from
their
magnificent
heritage
love
patriotism
courage
devotion
sacrifice
death
and
glory
a
week
after
that
meeting
at
the
front
i
was
in
dunkirk
when
i
ran
into
the
old
duck
of
a
mother
waiting
outside
the
big
grey
church
towards
dusk
but
now
she
is
sorrowful
poor
dear
a
cloud
has
come
over
her
bright
generous
face
with
its
affectionate
black
eyes
and
tender
lips
he
has
been
ordered
to
the
trenches
near
ypres
she
whispers
sadly
and
your
daughter
i
gasp
out
hush
here
she
comes
my
angel
with
the
heart
of
a
lion
she
has
been
in
the
church
to
pray
for
him
she
would
go
alone
of
our
three
faces
it
is
still
the
girl
wife
that
is
the
brightest
she
has
changed
of
course
she
is
no
longer
staring
with
dazzled
eyes
into
her
own
bliss
but
the
illumination
of
great
love
is
there
still
made
doubly
beautiful
now
by
the
knowledge
that
her
beloved
is
out
across
those
flat
sand
dunes
under
and
the
time
has
come
for
her
to
be
noble
as
a
soldier
bride
must
be
for
the
sake
of
her
husband
honour
and
his
little
one
unborn
though
he
fall
on
the
she
says
to
me
softly
with
that
sweet
brave
smile
on
her
quivering
lips
he
leaves
me
with
a
child
to
live
after
him
his
child
and
of
the
three
of
us
it
is
she
the
youngest
and
most
sorely
tried
who
looks
to
have
the
greatest
hold
on
life
present
and
eternal
chapter
li
a
lucky
meeting
to
meet
some
one
you
know
at
the
front
is
an
experiment
in
psychology
deeply
interesting
amusing
sometimes
and
often
strangely
illuminative
indeed
you
never
really
know
people
till
you
meet
them
under
the
sound
of
guns
it
is
at
furnes
that
i
meet
accidentally
a
very
eminent
journalist
and
a
very
author
suddenly
up
drives
a
funny
old
car
with
all
its
windows
broken
clatter
clatter
over
the
cobbled
streets
of
furnes
and
the
car
comes
to
a
stop
before
the
ancient
little
flemish
inn
out
jump
four
men
hastening
like
up
the
steps
they
come
bursting
breezily
into
the
room
where
i
have
just
finished
luncheon
i
look
they
look
we
all
look
one
of
them
with
a
bright
smile
comes
forward
how
do
you
do
says
he
he
is
the
chauffeur
if
you
please
the
chauffeur
in
the
big
overcoat
with
a
hood
over
his
head
he
looks
like
a
monk
till
you
see
his
face
then
he
is
all
brightness
and
sharpness
and
alertness
for
in
truth
he
is
england
most
famous
this
young
man
in
the
cowl
with
the
hatchet
profile
and
dancing
green
eyes
and
we
last
saw
each
other
in
the
agony
of
the
bombardment
of
antwerp
and
then
i
look
over
his
shoulder
and
see
another
face
i
can
scarcely
believe
my
eyes
here
at
the
world
end
as
near
the
front
as
anyone
can
get
driving
about
in
that
old
car
with
the
broken
windows
is
our
eminent
journalist
in
baggy
grey
knee
breeches
and
boots
having
a
look
round
says
the
journalist
simply
seeing
things
for
myself
a
bit
how
splendid
well
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
ca
keep
away
i
been
out
before
but
never
so
near
as
this
the
sordidness
and
suffering
of
it
all
makes
me
feel
i
simply
ca
stay
quietly
over
there
in
london
i
want
to
see
for
myself
how
things
are
going
then
dropping
the
subject
of
himself
swiftly
but
easily
the
journalist
begins
courteously
to
ask
questions
what
am
i
doing
here
where
have
i
come
from
where
am
i
going
well
at
the
present
moment
i
answer
i
trying
to
get
to
la
panne
i
want
to
see
the
queen
of
the
belgians
waiting
for
the
king
and
walking
there
on
the
yellow
dreamy
sands
by
the
north
sea
but
the
tram
is
running
any
longer
and
the
roads
are
bad
very
bad
indeed
all
in
an
instant
the
journalistic
instinct
is
alive
in
him
and
crying
i
watch
fascinated
i
can
see
him
seeing
that
picture
of
pictures
the
sweet
queen
walking
on
the
lonely
winter
sands
waiting
for
her
hero
to
come
back
from
the
battlefields
just
over
there
let
us
take
you
in
our
car
what
are
we
doing
where
were
we
going
anyway
it
does
matter
we
take
the
car
to
la
panne
and
after
luncheon
off
we
go
every
now
and
then
i
turn
the
corner
of
my
eye
on
the
man
beside
me
as
he
sits
there
hunched
up
in
a
heavy
coat
with
a
big
cigar
between
his
babyish
lips
talking
talking
and
what
is
so
glorious
about
it
all
is
that
this
is
the
journalist
talking
it
is
the
idealist
the
practical
dreamer
who
by
sheer
belief
in
his
ideals
has
won
his
way
to
the
top
of
his
profession
i
see
a
face
that
is
one
of
the
most
curiously
fascinating
in
europe
a
veiled
face
but
with
its
veil
for
ever
shifting
for
ever
lifting
for
ever
letting
you
get
a
glimpse
of
the
man
behind
power
and
will
are
sunk
deep
within
the
outer
veil
and
when
you
look
at
him
at
first
you
say
to
yourself
what
a
nice
big
boy
of
a
man
for
those
lips
are
almost
babyish
in
their
curves
the
lips
of
a
man
who
would
drink
the
cold
pure
water
of
life
in
preference
to
its
coloured
vintages
the
lips
of
an
idealist
who
but
an
idealist
could
keep
a
childish
mouth
through
the
intense
worldliness
of
the
battle
for
life
as
this
man
has
fought
it
right
from
the
very
beginning
over
the
broad
thoughtful
brow
flops
a
lock
of
brown
hair
every
now
and
then
his
eyes
are
grey
with
blue
in
them
when
you
look
at
them
they
look
straight
at
you
but
it
is
not
a
piercing
glance
it
seems
like
a
glance
from
far
away
all
kinds
of
swift
flashing
thoughts
and
impulses
go
sweeping
over
those
eyes
and
what
they
do
see
is
really
not
worth
seeing
though
when
i
come
to
think
of
it
i
can
not
recall
catching
them
looking
at
anything
as
far
as
faces
go
this
is
a
fine
face
decidedly
a
fine
arresting
face
sympathetic
likeable
and
the
strong
physique
of
a
frame
looks
as
if
it
could
carry
great
physical
burdens
though
more
exercise
would
probably
do
it
good
above
and
beyond
everything
he
looks
young
this
man
young
with
a
youth
that
will
never
desert
him
as
though
he
holds
within
himself
the
secrets
of
spring
on
we
fly
we
are
right
inside
the
belgian
lines
now
the
belgian
soldiers
are
all
around
us
brave
wonderful
belges
they
always
speak
of
themselves
like
that
the
belgian
army
les
petits
belges
perhaps
the
fact
that
they
have
proved
themselves
heroes
of
an
immortality
that
every
race
will
love
and
bow
down
to
in
ages
to
come
makes
these
men
thus
lightly
refer
to
themselves
with
that
inimitable
flash
of
the
belgian
smile
as
little
belgians
for
never
before
was
the
belgian
army
greater
than
it
is
with
its
numbers
depleted
its
territory
wrested
from
it
its
homes
ruined
its
loved
ones
scattered
far
and
wide
in
strange
lands
like
john
brown
army
it
still
goes
fighting
on
though
many
of
its
uniforms
battered
and
stained
with
the
blood
and
mud
and
powder
of
one
campaign
after
another
are
so
ragged
as
to
be
almost
in
pieces
we
are
no
longer
chic
a
belgian
captain
says
it
with
a
grin
as
he
chats
to
us
at
a
halt
where
we
shew
our
passes
he
flaps
his
hands
in
his
pockets
of
his
ragged
overcoat
and
smiles
in
a
way
it
is
true
their
uniforms
are
ragged
stained
burnt
torn
too
big
too
little
full
of
a
hundred
pitiful
little
discrepancies
that
peep
out
under
those
brand
new
overcoats
that
some
of
them
are
lucky
enough
to
have
obtained
they
have
been
fighting
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
they
have
left
bits
of
their
tunics
at
liège
namur
charleroi
aerschot
termonde
antwerp
they
have
lost
home
territory
family
friends
but
they
are
fighting
harder
than
ever
and
so
gloriously
uplifted
are
they
by
the
immortal
honour
they
have
wrested
from
destiny
that
they
can
look
at
their
ragged
trousers
with
a
grin
and
love
them
and
their
torn
burnt
blackened
tunics
even
as
a
conqueror
loves
the
emblems
of
his
glory
that
will
never
pale
upon
the
pages
of
history
a
soldier
loosens
a
bandage
with
his
teeth
and
breaks
into
a
song
it
is
so
gay
so
naive
so
insouciant
so
truly
and
deliciously
belge
that
i
catch
it
ere
it
fades
that
mocking
song
addressed
to
the
kaiser
asking
in
horror
who
are
these
ragged
beings
the
belgian
to
the
german
ils
pas
votre
bel
tunique
et
ils
pas
votre
bel
air
mais
leur
courage
est
magnifique
si
ils
pas
votre
bel
tunique
a
votre
morgue
ils
donnent
la
nicque
au
milieu
de
leur
plus
gros
revers
si
ils
pas
votre
bel
tunique
et
ils
pas
votre
bel
air
what
those
poor
fellows
want
most
says
the
journalist
as
we
flash
onwards
is
boots
they
want
one
hundred
thousand
boots
the
belgian
army
you
can
give
a
friend
all
sorts
of
things
but
he
hardly
likes
it
if
you
venture
to
give
him
boots
and
yet
they
want
them
these
poor
splendid
belgians
they
want
them
and
they
must
have
them
we
must
give
them
to
them
somehow
lots
of
them
have
no
boots
at
all
i
heard
that
the
belgians
were
getting
boots
from
america
the
author
puts
in
suddenly
the
journalist
turns
his
head
with
a
jerk
what
do
you
mean
he
asks
sharply
do
you
mean
that
they
have
them
from
america
or
that
america
them
i
believe
what
my
informant
a
sick
officer
in
the
belgian
army
whom
i
visited
this
morning
told
me
was
that
the
americans
were
the
boots
are
you
sure
it
the
journalist
persists
we
english
ought
to
see
to
that
last
night
i
had
an
interview
with
the
belgian
minister
of
war
and
i
tried
to
get
on
this
subject
of
boots
but
somehow
i
felt
it
was
intrusive
of
me
i
do
know
it
a
delicate
thing
it
wants
handling
yet
must
have
the
and
i
fancy
they
will
get
them
the
heroes
of
belgium
i
think
they
will
get
their
hundred
thousand
boots
then
a
whiff
of
the
sea
reaches
us
and
the
grey
waves
of
the
north
sea
stretch
out
before
us
over
the
edge
of
the
endless
yellow
sands
where
turcos
are
galloping
their
beautiful
horses
up
and
down
we
are
in
la
panne
the
journalist
sits
still
in
his
corner
of
the
car
not
fussing
not
questioning
leaving
it
all
to
me
this
is
my
show
it
is
i
who
have
come
here
to
see
the
gracious
queen
on
the
sands
all
the
part
he
plays
in
it
is
to
bring
me
so
the
journalist
and
the
author
and
the
others
remain
in
the
car
that
is
infinitely
considerate
exquisitely
so
indeed
for
no
writer
on
earth
would
care
to
go
looking
around
with
the
jupiter
of
journalists
at
her
elbow
rush
rush
we
are
on
our
way
back
now
the
cold
wind
of
wet
flat
flanders
strikes
at
us
as
we
fly
along
it
hits
us
in
the
face
and
on
the
back
it
flicks
us
by
the
ear
and
by
the
throat
the
window
behind
us
is
open
the
window
to
right
and
the
window
to
left
are
open
too
all
the
windows
are
open
because
as
i
said
before
they
are
all
broken
in
fact
there
are
no
windows
they
all
been
smashed
out
of
existence
there
are
only
holes
we
were
under
this
morning
observes
the
journalist
contentedly
then
truthfully
he
adds
i
do
like
shrapnel
any
woman
who
reads
this
will
know
how
i
felt
in
my
pride
when
a
malicious
wind
whisked
my
fur
right
off
my
shoulders
and
flung
it
through
the
back
window
far
on
the
road
behind
if
it
had
been
sable
i
would
have
let
it
go
out
of
sheer
humiliation
but
instead
after
a
moment
fierce
struggle
remembering
all
the
wardrobe
i
had
already
lost
in
antwerp
i
whispered
gustily
my
stole
it
blown
right
out
of
the
window
how
did
i
hope
the
journalist
would
not
be
cross
for
we
were
racing
back
then
against
time
and
it
was
highly
important
to
get
off
these
crowded
roads
with
the
soldiers
coming
and
going
coming
and
going
before
night
fell
cross
indeed
i
need
have
worried
absence
of
fuss
was
as
i
decided
later
the
most
salient
point
about
this
man
in
fact
his
whole
desire
seemed
to
make
himself
into
an
entire
nonentity
he
never
asserted
himself
he
never
interfered
he
never
made
any
suggestions
he
just
sat
quiet
and
calm
in
his
corner
of
the
car
puffing
away
at
his
big
cigar
another
curious
thing
about
him
was
the
way
in
which
this
man
used
to
bossing
organizing
suggesting
commanding
fell
into
his
part
which
was
by
force
of
circumstances
a
very
minor
one
he
was
incognito
he
was
not
the
eminent
journalist
at
all
he
was
just
an
eager
man
out
looking
at
a
war
he
was
there
in
a
manner
of
speaking
on
suffrance
for
in
war
time
civilians
are
wanted
at
the
front
and
nobody
recognized
this
more
acutely
than
the
man
with
the
cigar
between
his
lips
and
the
short
grey
knee
breeches
showing
sturdy
legs
in
their
dark
grey
stockings
and
thick
boots
the
impression
he
gave
me
was
of
understanding
absolutely
the
whole
situation
and
of
a
curiously
technical
comprehension
of
the
wee
little
tiny
part
that
he
could
be
allowed
to
play
where
are
you
staying
in
dunkirk
he
asked
in
a
room
over
a
milliner
shop
the
town
full
i
could
get
in
anywhere
else
then
will
you
dine
with
us
at
seven
at
the
hotel
des
arcades
i
should
love
to
and
we
ran
into
dunkirk
and
the
lights
flashed
around
me
and
that
extraordinary
whirl
of
officers
and
men
moving
up
and
down
the
cobbled
streets
struck
at
us
afresh
and
we
saw
the
sombre
khaki
of
englishmen
and
the
blue
and
red
of
the
belgian
and
the
varied
uniforms
and
scarlet
trousers
of
the
and
the
absolutely
indescribable
life
and
thrill
and
crowding
of
dunkirk
in
these
days
when
the
armies
of
three
nations
moved
surging
up
and
down
the
narrow
streets
at
i
went
up
the
wide
staircase
of
the
hotel
des
arcades
in
the
grand
place
of
dunkirk
quite
a
beautiful
and
splendid
hotel
though
innumerable
taubes
had
sailed
over
it
threatening
to
deface
it
with
their
ugly
little
bombs
but
luckily
without
success
so
far
very
luckily
indeed
considering
that
every
day
at
lunch
or
dinner
some
poor
belgian
officer
came
in
there
to
get
a
meal
precisely
seven
and
there
hastening
towards
me
was
our
host
he
had
not
dressed
as
we
say
in
england
he
had
merely
exchanged
the
short
grey
norfolk
knickerbockers
for
long
trousers
and
the
morning
coat
for
a
short
dark
blue
serge
his
eyes
were
sparkling
there
a
belgian
here
whom
i
want
you
to
meet
he
said
in
his
boyish
manner
that
admirably
concealed
the
power
of
this
man
that
one
was
for
ever
forgetting
in
his
presence
only
to
remember
it
all
the
more
acutely
when
one
thought
of
him
afterwards
it
the
chief
of
the
belgian
medical
department
he
quite
a
wonderful
man
and
we
went
in
to
dinner
the
journalist
arranged
the
table
it
was
rather
an
awkward
one
numerically
and
i
was
interested
to
see
how
he
would
come
out
of
the
problematic
affair
of
four
men
and
one
woman
but
with
one
swift
wave
of
his
hand
he
assigned
us
to
our
places
he
sat
on
one
side
of
the
table
with
the
head
of
the
belgian
medical
corps
at
his
right
i
sat
opposite
to
him
and
the
author
sat
on
my
left
and
the
other
man
who
had
something
to
do
with
boy
scouts
on
his
left
and
there
we
all
were
and
a
more
delightful
dinner
could
not
be
imagined
for
in
a
way
it
was
exciting
through
the
very
fact
of
being
eaten
in
a
city
that
the
germans
only
the
day
before
had
pelted
with
twenty
bombs
personalities
come
more
clearly
into
evidence
at
dinner
than
at
any
other
time
and
so
i
was
interested
to
see
how
the
journalist
played
his
part
of
host
what
would
he
be
like
there
are
so
many
different
kinds
of
hosts
would
he
be
the
kind
the
kind
that
knows
all
you
want
and
ought
to
want
and
sees
that
you
get
it
the
kind
that
says
always
the
right
thing
at
the
right
moment
and
keeps
his
party
alive
with
his
sally
of
wit
and
gaiety
and
bonhomie
and
makes
everyone
feel
that
they
are
having
the
time
of
their
lives
no
one
quickly
discovered
that
the
journalist
was
not
at
all
that
kind
of
host
at
dinner
where
some
men
become
bright
and
gay
and
inconsequential
this
man
became
serious
the
food
part
of
the
affair
bored
him
watching
him
and
studying
him
with
that
inner
eye
that
makes
the
bliss
of
solitude
one
saw
he
did
care
a
bit
about
food
and
still
less
about
wine
it
would
have
mattered
to
him
how
bad
the
dinner
was
he
would
know
he
could
think
about
it
for
he
was
something
more
than
your
bon
viveur
and
your
social
animal
this
man
with
his
wide
grey
eyes
and
the
flopping
lock
on
his
broad
forehead
he
was
the
dreamer
of
dreams
as
well
as
the
journalist
and
at
dinner
he
dreamed
oh
yes
indeed
he
dreamed
tremendously
it
was
all
the
same
to
him
whether
or
not
he
ate
pâté
de
fois
gras
or
fowl
bouillé
or
sausage
he
was
rapt
in
his
discussion
with
the
belgian
doctor
on
his
right
anæsthetics
and
antiseptics
that
what
they
are
talking
about
so
hard
and
suddenly
out
comes
a
piece
of
paper
the
journalist
wants
to
send
a
telegram
to
england
i
going
to
try
and
get
doctor
to
come
out
here
he
a
very
clever
chap
he
can
go
into
the
thing
thoroughly
it
important
it
must
be
gone
into
and
there
on
the
white
cloth
scribbled
on
the
back
of
a
menu
he
writes
out
his
telegram
but
then
says
the
journalist
reflectively
if
i
sign
that
the
censor
will
hold
it
up
for
three
days
the
head
of
the
belgian
medical
department
smiles
he
knows
what
that
telegram
would
mean
to
the
belgian
army
let
sign
it
he
says
in
a
gentle
voice
let
me
sign
it
and
send
it
my
telegrams
are
not
censored
and
your
english
doctor
will
meet
us
at
calais
and
all
will
be
well
with
your
magnificent
idea
just
then
the
author
on
the
left
appears
a
trifle
uneasy
he
holds
up
an
empty
burgundy
bottle
towards
the
light
a
dead
he
announces
distinctly
but
our
host
in
his
abstraction
does
not
hear
the
author
picks
up
the
other
bottle
holds
it
to
the
light
screws
up
one
eye
at
it
and
places
it
lengthwise
on
the
table
that
a
dead
too
he
says
just
then
with
great
good
luck
he
manages
to
catch
the
grey
eye
that
a
dead
too
he
repeats
loudly
how
exciting
to
see
whether
the
author
in
his
quite
natural
desire
to
have
a
little
more
wine
will
succeed
in
penetrating
his
dreaminess
and
absorption
in
the
anæsthetics
of
the
belgian
army
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
the
journalist
wakes
up
would
you
like
some
more
wine
he
inquires
these
are
both
dead
asserts
the
author
courageously
we
have
some
more
says
the
journalist
and
more
burgundy
comes
but
to
the
eminent
journalist
it
is
for
his
mind
is
still
filled
with
a
hundred
thousand
things
the
belgian
army
want
the
iodine
they
need
and
the
anæsthetics
and
nothing
else
exists
for
him
at
that
moment
but
to
do
what
he
can
for
the
nation
that
has
laid
down
its
life
for
england
burgundy
indeed
and
yet
one
feels
glad
that
the
author
eventually
gets
his
extra
bottle
he
has
done
something
for
england
too
he
has
given
us
laughter
when
our
days
were
very
black
and
our
soldiers
love
his
yarns
chapter
lii
the
ravening
wolf
how
hard
it
must
be
for
the
soldiers
to
remember
chat
there
ever
was
summer
how
far
off
how
unreal
are
those
burning
breathless
days
that
saw
the
fighting
round
namur
termonde
antwerp
here
in
flanders
in
december
august
and
september
seem
to
belong
to
centuries
gone
by
ugh
how
cold
it
is
the
wind
howls
up
and
down
this
long
white
road
and
away
on
either
side
as
far
as
the
eyes
can
see
stretches
wide
flat
flanders
country
white
and
glistening
with
the
red
sun
sinking
westward
and
the
pale
little
silvery
moon
smiling
her
pale
little
smile
through
the
black
bare
woods
in
this
little
old
flemish
village
from
somewhere
across
the
snow
the
thunder
and
fury
of
terrific
fighting
makes
sleep
impossible
for
more
than
five
minutes
at
a
time
then
suddenly
something
wakes
me
and
i
know
at
once
even
before
i
am
quite
awake
that
it
is
not
this
time
what
is
it
i
sit
up
in
bed
and
feel
for
the
matches
but
before
i
can
strike
one
i
hear
again
that
extraordinary
and
very
horrible
sound
i
lie
quite
still
and
now
a
strange
thing
has
happened
in
a
flash
my
thoughts
have
gone
back
over
years
and
years
and
years
and
it
is
years
ago
and
i
have
crossed
thousands
and
thousands
of
loping
leagues
of
sea
and
am
in
australia
in
the
burning
heat
of
i
am
a
schoolgirl
spending
my
christmas
holidays
in
the
australian
bush
it
is
night
i
am
a
nervous
little
creature
a
noise
wakes
me
i
shriek
and
wake
the
household
when
they
come
dashing
in
i
sob
out
pitifully
there
a
wolf
outside
the
window
i
heard
it
howling
it
only
a
dingo
darling
says
a
woman
tender
voice
consolingly
it
only
a
native
dog
trying
to
find
water
it
ca
get
in
here
anyway
i
remember
too
that
i
was
on
the
ground
floor
then
and
i
am
on
the
ground
floor
now
and
i
find
myself
wishing
i
could
hear
that
comforting
voice
again
telling
me
this
is
only
a
dingo
this
horrible
howling
thing
outside
there
in
the
night
i
creep
out
of
bed
and
tiptoe
to
the
window
quite
plainly
in
the
silvery
moonlight
i
see
standing
in
the
wide
open
space
in
front
of
this
little
flemish
inn
a
thin
gaunt
animal
with
its
tongue
lolling
out
i
see
the
froth
on
the
tongue
and
the
of
its
fangs
glistening
in
the
winter
moonlight
i
ask
myself
what
is
it
and
i
ask
too
why
should
i
feel
so
frightened
for
i
frightened
from
behind
the
white
muslin
curtains
i
gaze
at
that
apparition
absolutely
petrified
it
seems
to
me
that
i
shall
never
never
never
be
able
to
move
again
when
i
find
myself
knocking
at
the
caspiar
door
and
next
minute
the
old
proprietor
of
the
inn
and
his
wife
are
peeping
through
my
window
mon
dieu
it
is
a
wolf
old
caspiar
frames
the
word
with
his
lips
rather
than
utter
them
you
must
shoot
it
frames
his
wife
old
caspiar
gets
down
his
gun
but
it
falls
from
his
hands
i
ca
shoot
any
more
he
groans
i
lost
my
nerve
he
begins
to
cry
poor
old
man
he
has
lost
a
son
eleven
nephews
and
four
grandsons
in
this
war
as
well
as
his
nerve
poor
old
chap
and
he
remembers
the
siege
of
paris
he
remembers
only
too
well
that
terrible
unreal
dreamlike
time
that
has
suddenly
leapt
up
out
of
the
dim
far
past
into
the
present
shedding
its
airs
of
unreality
and
clothing
itself
in
all
the
glaring
horrors
of
until
again
the
past
is
the
present
and
the
present
is
the
past
and
both
are
inextricably
and
cruelly
mixed
for
frenchmen
of
caspiar
age
and
memories
a
touch
on
my
arm
and
i
start
violently
madame
it
is
poor
old
madame
caspiar
whispering
to
you
are
english
you
are
brave
can
shoot
the
wolf
i
am
staggered
at
the
idea
shoot
oh
i
miss
it
i
dare
try
it
i
never
even
handled
a
gun
i
stammer
out
i
see
myself
revealed
now
as
the
coward
that
i
am
then
shall
shoot
it
says
old
madame
caspiar
in
a
trembling
voice
she
picks
up
the
gun
when
i
was
a
girl
i
was
a
very
good
shot
she
speaks
loudly
as
if
to
reassure
herself
old
caspiar
suddenly
jumps
up
you
mad
terèse
vous
êtes
folle
you
ca
even
see
to
read
the
newspapers
he
takes
the
gun
from
her
she
begins
to
cry
now
i
shall
go
and
call
the
others
she
says
weeping
be
quiet
he
says
crossly
you
frighten
the
beast
away
if
you
make
a
noise
like
that
he
crosses
the
room
and
peers
out
again
it
eating
something
he
says
mon
dieu
is
rather
the
caspiar
pet
rabbit
you
shall
pay
for
that
mutters
old
caspiar
gently
opening
the
window
he
fires
not
since
have
i
seen
a
wolf
says
caspiar
looking
down
at
the
dead
beast
then
they
used
to
run
in
out
of
the
forest
when
i
was
an
apprentice
in
my
uncle
inn
we
were
always
frightened
of
them
and
now
even
after
the
germans
we
are
frightened
of
them
still
i
am
more
frightened
of
wolves
than
i
am
of
germans
confesses
madame
caspiar
in
a
whisper
we
stand
there
in
the
breaking
dawn
looking
at
the
dead
wolf
and
wondering
fearfully
if
there
are
not
more
of
its
kind
creeping
in
from
the
plains
beyond
other
figures
join
us
two
french
doctors
a
wounded
english
colonel
la
grandmère
mme
caspiar
mother
and
a
belgian
priest
all
come
issuing
gradually
from
the
low
portals
of
the
inn
into
the
yard
then
in
the
chill
dawn
with
the
glare
of
the
in
our
eyes
we
discuss
the
matter
in
low
voices
it
is
touching
to
find
that
each
one
is
thinking
of
his
own
soldiers
and
the
menace
that
packs
of
hungry
wolves
may
mean
to
them
english
belgian
french
especially
to
wounded
men
it
the
sound
of
the
guns
that
brings
them
out
says
a
french
doctor
learnedly
this
wolf
has
probably
travelled
hundreds
of
miles
and
of
course
there
are
more
oui
oui
ça
certainly
there
will
be
more
ça
ça
agrees
the
priest
such
a
huge
beast
too
says
the
colonel
he
is
probably
comparing
it
with
a
fox
i
find
myself
mentally
agreeing
with
madame
caspiar
that
germans
are
really
preferable
to
wolves
the
long
white
road
that
leads
back
to
the
world
seems
endlessly
long
as
i
stare
out
of
the
inn
windows
realizing
that
sooner
or
later
i
must
traverse
that
long
white
lonely
road
across
the
plains
before
i
can
get
to
safety
and
the
nearest
town
are
there
more
wolves
in
there
slinking
ever
nearer
to
the
cities
that
is
what
everyone
seems
to
believe
now
we
see
them
in
scores
in
hundreds
prowling
with
hot
breath
in
search
of
wounded
soldiers
or
anyone
they
can
get
we
are
all
undoubtedly
depressed
then
a
provision
motor
comes
down
that
road
and
out
of
it
jumps
a
little
old
man
in
a
heavy
sheepskin
overcoat
and
red
woollen
gloves
carrying
something
wrapped
in
a
shawl
he
comes
clattering
into
the
inn
his
small
black
eyes
are
swimming
with
tears
mon
dieu
he
says
gulping
some
coffee
and
rum
give
me
a
little
hot
milk
madame
my
poor
monkey
is
near
dying
a
tiny
black
piteous
face
looks
out
of
the
shawl
and
huskily
the
man
with
the
red
gloves
explains
that
he
has
been
for
weeks
trying
to
get
his
travelling
circus
out
of
the
the
army
commandeered
my
horses
we
had
great
difficulty
in
moving
about
we
wanted
to
get
to
paris
all
my
poor
animals
have
been
terrified
by
the
noises
of
the
big
guns
especially
the
monkeys
all
died
except
this
one
you
poor
little
beast
says
the
colonel
bending
down
he
has
seen
men
die
in
thousands
this
gaunt
englishman
with
his
eye
in
a
sling
but
his
voice
is
infinitely
compassionate
as
he
looks
with
one
eye
at
the
little
shivering
creature
and
murmurs
again
you
little
brute
yesterday
adds
the
man
with
the
red
gloves
my
trick
wolf
escaped
she
was
a
beauty
and
so
clever
when
the
war
began
i
used
to
dress
her
up
as
a
french
solider
red
trousers
red
cap
and
all
you
have
seen
a
wolf
running
about
these
parts
nobody
answers
for
a
bit
we
are
all
stunned
but
the
old
fellow
brightens
up
when
he
hears
that
his
wolf
ate
the
rabbit
ah
but
she
was
a
clever
wolf
he
cries
excitedly
very
likely
the
reason
why
she
ate
your
was
because
she
has
played
the
part
of
a
french
soldier
soldiers
always
steal
the
rabbits
chapter
liii
back
to
london
i
am
on
my
way
back
to
london
grateful
and
glad
to
be
once
more
on
our
side
of
the
channel
five
days
exclaims
a
young
soldier
in
the
train
he
flings
back
his
head
draws
a
deep
breath
and
remains
staring
like
an
imbecile
at
the
roof
of
the
railway
carriage
for
quite
two
minutes
then
he
shakes
himself
draws
another
deep
breath
and
says
again
still
staring
at
the
roof
five
days
the
train
has
started
now
out
into
the
night
we
have
left
folkestone
well
behind
we
have
pulled
down
all
the
blinds
because
a
proclamation
commands
us
to
do
so
and
we
are
softly
yet
swiftly
rushing
through
the
cool
english
country
back
towards
good
old
victoria
station
where
all
continental
trains
must
now
make
their
arrivals
and
departures
have
you
been
wounded
sir
asks
an
old
lady
in
a
queer
black
astrakhan
cap
and
with
a
big
nose
wounded
rather
right
on
top
of
the
head
he
ducks
his
fair
head
to
shew
us
i
did
know
it
when
it
happened
i
did
feel
anything
at
all
i
only
knew
there
was
something
wet
blood
i
suppose
then
they
sent
me
to
the
hospital
at
lazaire
and
i
had
a
ripping
cornish
nurse
but
lor
what
a
fool
i
was
i
actually
signed
on
that
i
wanted
to
go
back
why
did
i
do
that
i
do
know
i
did
want
to
go
back
to
go
back
good
lor
think
of
it
but
i
went
back
and
the
next
thing
was
mons
even
now
i
ca
believe
it
that
march
the
germans
were
at
us
all
the
time
it
did
seem
possible
we
could
do
it
up
men
only
another
six
kilometres
an
officer
would
say
then
it
would
be
another
seven
kilometres
keep
going
men
sometimes
we
went
to
sleep
marching
and
woke
up
and
found
ourselves
still
marching
always
we
were
shifting
and
relieving
it
was
a
wonderful
business
it
seemed
as
if
we
were
done
for
it
seemed
as
if
we
could
go
on
but
we
did
good
lor
did
it
somehow
the
english
generally
seem
to
do
it
some
of
us
had
no
boots
left
some
of
us
had
no
feet
we
did
it
the
old
lady
with
the
black
astrakhan
cap
nods
vigorously
and
the
germans
would
acknowledge
that
victory
of
ours
she
says
i
did
see
it
in
any
of
their
papers
it
is
rather
lovely
to
hear
the
dear
creature
alluding
to
mons
as
our
victory
but
indeed
she
is
right
mons
is
in
truth
our
glory
and
our
pride
but
it
is
still
more
startling
to
find
she
knows
secret
things
about
the
german
newspapers
and
we
all
look
at
her
sharply
i
just
come
from
germany
the
old
lady
explains
just
come
from
dresden
where
i
been
living
for
fifteen
years
oh
dear
i
did
have
a
time
getting
away
but
i
had
to
leave
they
made
me
is
being
turned
into
a
fortified
town
and
a
basis
for
operations
we
all
now
listen
to
the
soldiers
three
as
well
whenever
we
heard
a
noise
in
dresden
everyone
said
the
russians
coming
so
you
see
how
frightened
they
are
of
the
russians
they
are
scared
to
death
they
almost
forgotten
their
hatred
for
england
they
talk
of
nothing
now
but
the
russians
their
terror
is
really
pathetic
considering
all
the
boasting
they
been
doing
up
to
now
they
made
a
law
that
no
one
was
to
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
under
of
beasts
says
the
wounded
one
there
only
military
music
in
dresden
now
all
the
theatres
and
concert
rooms
are
shut
and
of
course
from
now
there
will
be
nothing
but
military
doings
in
dresden
yes
i
lived
there
for
fifteen
years
i
tried
to
stay
on
i
had
many
english
friends
as
well
as
germans
and
the
english
all
agreed
to
taboo
all
english
people
who
adopted
a
tone
some
did
but
not
many
my
greatest
friends
my
dearest
friends
were
germans
but
the
situation
grew
impossible
for
us
all
we
were
not
alienated
personally
but
we
all
knew
that
there
would
come
between
us
something
too
deep
and
strong
to
be
defied
or
denied
even
for
great
affection
sake
so
i
cut
the
cables
and
left
when
the
order
was
given
that
dresden
was
henceforth
to
be
a
fortified
town
besides
it
was
dangerous
for
me
to
remain
i
was
english
and
they
hissed
at
me
sometimes
when
i
went
out
it
was
through
the
american
assistance
that
i
was
enabled
to
get
away
i
saw
such
horrid
pictures
of
the
english
in
all
the
shops
it
made
my
blood
boil
i
saw
one
picture
of
the
englishmen
with
legs
to
run
away
with
beasts
says
the
wounded
one
wait
till
i
travel
in
germany
and
oh
dear
goes
on
the
old
lady
i
was
so
frightened
that
i
should
forget
and
put
my
head
out
without
thinking
as
i
sat
in
the
train
coming
away
from
dresden
i
said
to
myself
all
the
time
must
not
look
out
of
the
window
or
you
have
your
head
shot
off
that
was
because
they
feared
the
russian
spies
might
try
to
drop
explosives
out
of
the
trains
on
to
their
bridges
beasts
says
the
wounded
one
again
it
is
really
remarkable
what
a
variety
of
expressions
this
young
english
gentleman
manages
to
put
in
a
word
he
belongs
to
a
good
family
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
he
cleared
out
without
a
word
to
anyone
and
enlisted
in
the
ranks
now
he
is
coming
home
on
five
days
leave
covered
with
glory
and
a
big
scar
to
get
his
commission
he
is
a
splendid
type
all
he
thinks
about
is
his
country
and
killing
germans
he
is
a
gorgeous
and
magnificent
type
for
here
he
is
in
perfect
comradeship
with
his
pal
tommy
in
the
corner
and
the
irishman
next
to
him
evidently
to
him
they
are
more
than
gentlemen
they
are
men
who
been
with
him
through
mons
and
the
battle
of
the
aisne
and
the
battle
of
ypres
and
he
loves
them
for
what
they
are
and
they
love
him
for
what
he
is
and
they
a
splendid
trio
the
soldiers
three
when
i
git
into
germany
says
tommy
i
mean
to
lay
hands
on
all
i
can
git
i
goin
to
loot
off
them
germans
like
they
looted
off
them
pore
beljins
surely
you
would
be
like
the
crown
prince
says
the
old
lady
and
we
all
wake
up
to
the
fact
then
that
she
really
a
delightful
old
lady
for
only
a
delightful
old
lady
could
put
the
case
as
neatly
as
that
shure
all
i
care
about
says
the
big
quiet
irishman
in
the
corner
is
to
sleep
and
sleep
and
sleep
on
a
bed
says
the
wounded
one
good
lor
think
of
it
sleep
in
a
bed
i
roll
over
and
over
to
make
sure
i
there
think
of
it
sheets
blankets
we
do
even
get
a
blanket
in
the
trenches
we
might
get
too
comfortable
and
go
to
sleep
what
about
the
little
oil
stoves
the
newspapers
say
you
having
asks
the
old
lady
we
seen
none
of
them
assert
the
soldiers
three
divil
a
one
of
them
adds
the
irishman
i
eat
things
i
never
eat
before
says
tommy
suddenly
in
his
simple
way
that
is
so
curiously
telling
i
eat
raw
turnips
out
of
the
fields
they
all
eatin
raw
turnips
over
there
and
i
eat
sweets
i
eat
pounds
of
chocolates
if
i
could
get
them
and
i
never
eat
them
before
in
my
life
sinst
i
was
a
kid
oh
chocolates
says
the
wounded
one
ecstatically
but
chocolate
in
the
sheet
thick
wide
heavy
chocolate
there
nothing
on
earth
like
it
i
wrote
home
and
put
all
over
my
letters
chocolate
chocolate
they
sent
me
out
tons
of
it
but
i
never
got
it
it
went
astray
somewhere
or
other
but
they
very
good
to
us
says
tommy
earnestly
we
do
want
for
nothin
you
could
be
better
treated
than
what
we
are
what
do
you
like
most
to
receive
asks
the
old
lady
chocolate
they
all
answer
simultaneously
the
other
night
at
ypres
says
tommy
with
his
usual
unexpectedness
a
german
came
out
of
his
trenches
he
shouted
waiter
want
to
come
back
to
the
english
please
take
me
prisoner
we
did
want
no
german
waiters
we
ca
be
bothered
takin
the
beggars
prisoners
we
let
go
at
him
instead
they
eat
like
savages
puts
in
the
irishman
i
see
them
shovelling
their
food
in
with
one
hand
and
pushing
it
down
with
the
other
is
my
opinion
the
germans
have
got
no
throats
the
germans
have
lots
to
eat
asserts
tommy
whenever
we
capture
them
we
always
find
them
well
stocked
brown
bread
they
always
have
brown
bread
and
bully
beef
and
raisins
beasts
says
the
wounded
one
again
but
good
lor
their
jack
johnsons
when
i
think
of
them
now
i
ca
believe
it
at
all
like
fifty
shells
a
minute
sometimes
sometimes
in
the
middle
of
all
the
inferno
i
think
i
was
dead
or
in
hell
i
often
thought
that
them
guns
cawst
them
a
lot
says
tommy
it
cawst
each
loading
we
used
to
be
laying
there
in
the
trenches
and
to
pass
the
time
while
they
was
firing
at
us
we
count
up
how
much
it
was
cawsting
them
that
that
bit
of
shrapnel
we
say
and
there
goes
another
they
waste
their
shells
something
terrible
too
there
thirty
notes
gone
for
nothing
we
reckon
up
sometimes
when
thirty
shells
had
exploded
in
nothin
but
mud
then
the
wounded
one
tells
us
a
funny
story
i
was
getting
messages
in
one
day
when
this
came
through
turks
are
wearing
fez
and
neutral
trousers
we
could
make
head
or
tail
of
the
neutral
trousers
so
we
pressed
for
an
explanation
it
came
turks
are
wearing
fez
breaches
of
neutrality
and
while
we
are
laughing
the
train
runs
into
victoria
station
and
the
soldiers
three
leap
joyously
out
into
the
london
night
then
dear
familiar
words
break
on
our
ears
in
a
woman
voice
any
luggage
mum
says
a
woman
porter
and
we
know
that
old
england
is
carrying
on
as
usual
the
