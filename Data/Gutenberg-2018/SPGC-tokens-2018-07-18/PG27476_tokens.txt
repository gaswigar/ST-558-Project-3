sweet
home
she
was
talking
him
this
was
a
thing
she
frequently
did
and
she
had
two
ways
of
doing
it
one
was
to
talk
at
him
through
a
third
party
when
they
two
were
not
alone
together
the
other
to
convey
moralizings
and
innuendo
for
his
edification
when
they
were
as
in
the
present
case
just
now
she
was
extolling
the
superabundant
virtues
of
somebody
husband
with
a
tone
and
meaning
which
were
intended
to
convey
to
laurence
stanninghame
that
she
wished
to
heaven
part
of
them
was
vested
in
hers
he
was
accustomed
to
being
thus
talked
at
he
ought
to
be
seeing
he
had
known
about
thirteen
years
of
it
on
and
off
but
he
did
not
like
it
any
the
better
from
force
of
habit
we
doubt
if
anybody
ever
does
however
he
had
long
ceased
to
take
any
notice
in
the
way
of
retort
no
matter
how
acrid
the
tone
how
biting
the
innuendo
now
pushing
back
his
chair
from
the
he
got
up
and
turning
to
the
mantelpiece
proceeded
to
fill
a
pipe
his
spouse
exasperated
by
his
silence
continued
to
talk
at
his
back
the
sickly
rays
of
the
autumn
sun
struggled
feebly
through
the
murk
of
the
suburban
atmosphere
creeping
over
the
carpet
then
up
to
the
dingy
whose
dinginess
had
this
redeeming
point
that
it
toned
down
what
otherwise
would
have
been
staring
crude
hideous
the
furniture
was
battered
and
worn
and
there
was
an
atmosphere
of
dustiness
grimy
which
seemed
inseparable
from
the
place
in
the
street
a
engineered
by
a
brace
of
sham
italians
was
rapping
out
the
latest
abomination
laurence
stanninghame
turned
again
to
his
wife
who
was
still
seated
at
the
table
continue
he
said
it
is
a
great
art
knowing
when
to
make
the
most
of
one
opportunities
which
for
present
purposes
may
be
taken
to
mean
that
you
had
better
let
off
all
the
steam
you
can
for
you
have
only
two
days
more
to
do
it
in
only
two
whole
days
going
away
again
staccato
laurence
nodded
and
emitted
a
cloud
or
two
of
smoke
there
rumbled
forth
a
cannonade
of
words
which
did
not
precisely
express
approval
then
staccato
where
are
you
going
to
this
time
johannesburg
what
but
it
nonsense
it
fact
well
of
course
you
ca
go
who
says
so
of
course
you
ca
go
and
leave
us
here
all
alone
she
replied
speaking
quickly
why
it
too
preposterous
i
been
treated
shamefully
enough
all
these
years
but
this
puts
the
crowning
straw
on
to
it
she
went
on
beginning
to
mix
her
metaphor
as
angry
people
and
especially
angry
women
will
of
course
you
ca
go
to
one
statement
as
made
above
he
was
at
no
pains
to
reply
he
had
heard
it
so
often
that
it
had
long
since
passed
into
the
category
of
not
new
not
true
and
does
matter
to
the
other
he
answered
i
an
idea
that
the
term
course
makes
the
other
way
i
go
and
i
am
going
in
fact
i
have
already
booked
my
passage
by
the
sailing
from
southampton
the
day
after
look
will
that
convince
you
holding
out
the
passage
ticket
then
there
was
a
scene
an
awful
racket
it
was
infamous
she
would
not
put
up
with
such
treatment
it
amounted
to
desertion
and
so
forth
yes
it
was
a
scene
indeed
but
force
of
habit
had
utterly
dulled
its
effectiveness
as
a
weapon
indeed
the
only
effect
it
might
have
been
calculated
to
produce
in
the
mind
of
the
offending
party
had
he
not
already
secured
his
berth
would
be
that
of
moving
him
to
sally
forth
and
carry
out
that
operation
on
the
spot
look
here
he
said
when
failure
of
breath
and
vocabulary
had
perforce
effected
a
lull
i
had
about
enough
of
this
awful
life
and
so
going
to
try
if
i
ca
do
something
to
set
things
right
again
before
it
too
late
now
the
johannesburg
is
the
thing
to
do
it
if
anything
will
it
kill
or
cure
and
what
if
it
kill
what
if
it
kill
then
one
may
as
well
take
it
fighting
better
anyway
than
scattering
one
brains
on
that
some
morning
in
the
small
hours
out
of
sheer
disgust
with
the
dead
hopelessness
of
life
that
what
it
is
coming
to
as
things
now
are
all
very
well
but
in
that
case
what
is
to
become
of
me
of
us
a
very
hard
look
came
into
the
man
face
at
the
question
in
that
case
draw
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
there
plenty
there
he
answered
shortly
his
pipe
which
had
gone
out
in
the
reply
seemed
to
fan
up
her
wrath
anew
and
she
started
in
to
talk
at
him
again
under
which
circumstances
perhaps
it
was
just
as
well
that
a
couple
of
heavy
bangs
overhead
and
a
series
of
appalling
yells
betokening
a
nursery
catastrophe
should
cut
short
her
eloquence
and
start
her
off
to
investigate
left
alone
still
standing
with
his
back
to
the
mantelpiece
laurence
stanninghame
put
forth
a
hand
it
shook
was
in
fact
all
of
a
tremble
look
at
that
he
said
to
himself
the
squalid
racket
of
this
life
is
playing
the
devil
with
my
nerves
i
believe
i
could
drink
a
wineglassful
of
grog
at
this
moment
without
spilling
half
of
it
on
the
floor
i
try
anyhow
he
unlocked
a
chiffonier
produced
a
whisky
bottle
and
having
poured
some
into
a
wineglass
not
filling
it
tossed
off
the
nip
that
better
he
said
then
mechanically
he
moved
to
the
window
and
stood
looking
out
though
in
reality
seeing
nothing
he
was
thinking
thinking
hard
the
course
he
had
decided
to
adopt
was
the
right
thing
as
to
that
he
had
no
sort
of
doubt
he
had
no
regular
income
and
such
remnant
of
capital
as
he
still
possessed
was
dwindling
alarmingly
men
had
made
fortunes
at
places
like
johannesburg
starting
with
almost
literally
the
traditional
why
should
not
he
not
that
he
expected
to
make
a
fortune
a
fair
competence
would
satisfy
him
a
sufficiency
the
thought
of
no
longer
being
obliged
to
hold
an
inquest
on
every
sixpence
of
bidding
farewell
forever
to
this
life
of
pinching
and
screwing
of
dwelling
decently
instead
of
pigging
it
in
a
cramped
and
of
enjoying
once
more
some
of
brightnesses
sport
for
instance
of
which
he
was
passionately
fond
of
the
means
to
wander
when
disposed
through
earth
fairest
places
these
reflections
would
have
fired
his
soul
as
he
stood
there
but
that
the
flame
of
hopefulness
had
long
since
died
within
him
and
gone
out
now
they
only
evoked
bitterness
by
their
tantalizing
allurement
other
men
had
made
their
pile
why
should
not
he
rainsford
for
instance
who
had
been
if
possible
more
down
on
his
luck
than
himself
rainsford
had
gone
out
to
the
new
gold
town
while
it
was
yet
very
new
and
had
made
a
good
thing
of
it
two
or
three
other
acquaintances
of
his
had
gone
there
and
had
made
very
much
more
than
a
good
thing
of
it
why
should
not
he
laurence
stanninghame
was
just
touching
middle
age
as
he
stood
at
the
window
the
murky
september
sun
seemed
to
bring
out
the
lines
and
wrinkles
of
his
face
which
was
distinctly
the
face
of
a
man
who
has
not
made
a
good
thing
of
life
and
who
can
never
for
a
moment
lose
sight
of
that
fact
there
were
lines
above
the
eyes
clear
blue
and
somewhat
sunken
eyes
which
denoted
the
habit
of
the
brows
to
contract
on
very
slight
provocation
and
far
oftener
than
was
good
for
their
owner
peace
of
mind
and
the
bronze
underlying
the
clear
skin
told
of
a
former
life
in
the
open
possibly
under
a
warmer
sun
than
that
now
playing
upon
it
as
to
its
features
it
was
a
strong
face
but
there
was
a
certain
indefinable
something
about
it
when
off
its
guard
which
would
have
told
a
close
physiognomist
of
the
possession
of
latent
instincts
unknown
to
their
possessor
instincts
which
if
stifled
choked
were
not
dead
and
which
if
ever
their
depths
were
stirred
would
yield
forth
strange
and
dangerous
possibilities
he
was
of
fine
constitution
active
and
wiry
but
the
cramped
life
and
squalid
worry
of
a
suburban
existence
had
as
he
told
himself
played
the
mischief
with
his
nerves
and
now
to
this
was
added
the
ghastly
vista
of
impending
actual
beggary
whatever
he
did
and
wherever
he
went
this
thought
would
not
be
quenched
it
was
ever
with
him
gnawing
like
an
aching
tooth
lying
awake
at
night
it
would
glare
at
him
with
spectral
eyes
in
the
darkness
then
unless
he
could
force
himself
by
all
manner
of
strange
and
artificial
means
such
as
repeating
favourite
verse
and
so
forth
to
throw
it
off
to
sleep
result
nerves
yet
further
shaken
a
succession
of
brooding
days
and
system
thrown
off
its
balance
by
domestic
friction
and
strife
many
a
man
has
sought
a
remedy
for
far
less
ill
in
the
bottle
whether
of
grog
or
laudanum
but
this
one
character
was
in
its
strength
proof
against
the
first
while
for
the
latter
that
might
come
but
only
as
a
very
last
extremity
meanwhile
ofttimes
he
wondered
how
that
blank
hopeless
feeling
of
having
completely
done
with
life
could
be
his
seeing
that
he
was
still
in
his
prime
formerly
eager
sanguine
glowing
with
good
impulses
now
indifferent
sceptical
with
a
heart
of
stone
and
the
chronic
sneer
of
a
cynic
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
seem
born
never
to
succeed
with
everything
in
his
favour
apparently
laurence
stanninghame
never
did
succeed
everything
he
touched
seemed
to
go
wrong
if
he
speculated
whether
it
was
a
bet
or
a
investment
smash
went
the
concern
he
was
of
an
inventive
turn
and
had
patented
of
course
at
considerable
expenditure
a
thing
or
two
but
by
some
crafty
twist
of
the
law
subtle
rascalities
others
had
managed
to
reap
the
benefit
he
had
tried
his
hand
at
writing
but
press
and
publisher
alike
shied
at
him
he
was
too
bitter
too
bold
too
sweeping
too
thorough
so
he
threw
that
as
he
had
thrown
other
things
in
sheer
disgust
and
hopelessness
now
he
was
going
to
cast
in
the
net
for
a
final
effort
and
already
his
spirits
began
to
revive
at
the
thought
any
faint
spark
of
lingering
sentiment
if
any
there
were
was
quenched
in
the
thought
that
the
turn
of
the
wheel
might
bring
good
luck
but
it
was
impossible
it
could
strand
him
in
worse
case
for
the
sentimental
side
of
it
separation
long
absence
well
the
droop
of
the
cynical
corners
of
the
mouth
became
more
emphasized
at
the
recollection
of
that
faded
old
figment
home
sweet
home
and
glowing
aspirations
after
the
holy
and
pure
joys
of
the
family
circle
whereas
the
reality
a
sort
of
punch
and
judy
show
at
best
no
there
was
no
sentimental
side
to
this
undertaking
yet
laurence
stanninghame
partner
in
life
was
by
no
means
a
bad
sort
of
a
woman
she
had
plenty
of
redeeming
qualities
in
that
she
was
at
bottom
and
and
withal
a
most
devoted
mother
but
she
had
a
tongue
and
a
temper
together
with
an
exceedingly
injudicious
not
to
say
foolish
twist
of
mind
and
this
combination
other
good
points
notwithstanding
the
quality
which
should
avail
to
redeem
has
hitherto
remained
undiscoverable
in
any
live
human
being
furthermore
she
owned
a
will
when
two
wills
come
into
contact
the
weakest
goes
under
and
that
soon
then
there
may
be
peace
in
this
case
neither
went
under
because
presumably
evenly
balanced
result
warfare
incessant
chronic
having
finished
his
pipe
laurence
stanninghame
got
out
a
hat
and
an
umbrella
and
set
to
work
to
brush
the
former
and
furl
the
latter
prior
to
going
out
the
hat
was
not
of
that
uniform
and
glossy
smoothness
which
one
could
see
into
to
shave
and
the
umbrella
was
of
aspect
the
morning
coat
though
well
cut
was
shiny
at
the
seams
yet
in
spite
of
the
wear
and
tear
of
his
outer
gear
with
so
unmistakably
thoroughbred
a
look
was
their
wearer
stamped
that
it
seemed
he
might
have
worn
anything
many
a
man
would
have
looked
and
felt
shabby
in
this
long
service
this
one
never
gave
it
a
thought
or
if
he
did
it
was
only
to
wonder
whether
he
should
ever
again
after
this
time
put
on
that
venerable
and
if
so
what
sort
of
experiences
would
have
been
his
in
the
interim
now
there
was
a
patter
of
feet
in
the
passage
the
turned
softly
and
a
little
girl
came
in
she
was
a
child
with
that
rare
combination
of
brown
eyes
and
golden
hair
here
if
anywhere
was
laurence
stanninghame
soft
place
his
other
progeny
was
represented
by
two
sturdy
boys
combative
of
instinct
and
firm
of
tread
and
whose
gambols
whether
pacific
or
bellicose
were
apt
to
shake
the
rattletrap
old
and
the
parental
nerves
in
about
equal
proportions
constituting
furthermore
a
standing
bone
of
parental
contention
this
little
one
however
having
turned
ten
was
of
a
companionable
age
and
to
the
male
understanding
the
baby
stage
does
not
as
a
rule
commend
itself
she
was
full
of
the
racket
which
had
just
taken
place
overhead
but
to
this
laurence
hardly
listened
there
was
always
a
racket
overhead
a
fight
or
a
fall
or
a
bumping
one
more
or
less
hardly
mattered
he
was
thinking
of
his
own
weakness
would
she
feel
parting
with
him
children
as
a
rule
were
easily
consoled
a
new
and
gaudy
toy
would
make
them
forget
anything
and
appositely
to
this
thought
the
little
one
mind
was
also
full
of
a
marvellous
engine
she
had
seen
the
last
time
she
had
been
taken
into
london
one
which
wound
up
with
a
key
and
ran
a
great
distance
without
stopping
being
alone
for
by
this
time
he
had
come
to
regard
all
display
of
affection
before
others
as
a
weakness
laurence
drew
the
child
to
him
and
kissed
her
tenderly
and
supposing
that
engine
were
some
day
to
come
puffing
in
fay
or
the
day
after
he
said
the
little
one
eyes
danced
the
toy
was
an
expensive
one
quite
out
of
reach
for
her
she
knew
if
only
it
were
not
and
now
her
delighted
look
and
her
reply
made
him
smile
with
a
strange
mixture
of
sadness
and
cynicism
and
as
approaching
footsteps
heralded
further
invasion
he
put
the
child
from
him
hurriedly
and
went
out
hailing
a
tram
car
he
made
his
way
up
to
town
to
carry
out
the
remainder
of
his
sudden
though
not
very
extensive
preparations
now
on
the
following
evening
arrived
a
package
of
toys
of
a
splendour
hitherto
unparalleled
within
that
dingy
suburban
and
there
was
a
great
banging
of
gorgeous
drums
and
a
tootling
of
glittering
trumpets
and
little
fay
was
with
delight
in
the
acquisition
of
the
wondrous
locomotive
ultimately
declining
to
go
to

adam
first
wife
the
was
cleaving
her
southward
way
through
the
smooth
translucence
of
the
tropical
sea
it
was
the
middle
of
the
morning
her
passengers
scattered
around
her
in
the
coolness
of
the
sheltering
awning
were
amusing
themselves
after
their
kind
some
gregarious
and
chatting
in
groups
others
singly
or
in
pairs
reading
the
men
were
mostly
in
flannels
and
blazers
and
the
women
affected
light
array
of
a
cool
nature
and
all
looked
as
though
it
were
too
much
trouble
to
move
or
even
to
speak
though
here
and
there
an
individual
more
enterprising
than
his
or
her
fellows
would
make
a
spasmodic
attempt
at
a
constitutional
said
attempt
usually
resolving
itself
into
five
and
a
half
feeble
turns
up
and
down
the
clear
part
of
the
deck
to
culminate
in
abrupt
collapse
for
it

what
a
lazy
johnnie
you
are
stanninghame
now
what
the
deuce
are
you
thinking
about
all
this
time
i
wonder
he
addressed
who
had
been
gazing
out
upon
the
sea
and
plunged
in
dreamy
thought
did
not
even
turn
his
head
get
into
this
chair
holmes
if
you
want
to
talk
he
said
a
fellow
ca
wring
his
own
neck
and
emit
articulate
sound
at
the
same
time
what
the
other
who
had
come
up
behind
laughed
and
dropped
into
the
empty
beside
laurence
he
was
the
latter
cabin
chum
and
the
two
had
become
rather
friendly
nothing
to
do
and
plenty
of
time
to
do
it
in
he
went
on
stretching
himself
and
yawning
i
jolly
sick
of
this
voyage
already
and
we
scarcely
half
through
with
it
it
a
fact
holmes
but
not
sick
of
it
a
bit
eh
and
the
other
stared
that
odd
stanninghame
you
i
should
have
thought
if
anyone
would
be
just
tired
of
it
by
now
why
you
never
even
cut
into
any
of
the
fun
that
going
such
as
it
is
you
may
well
put
that
in
holmes
as
for
instance
listen
for
the
whanging
of
the
piano
in
the
saloon
beneath
had
attained
to
an
even
greater
pitch
of
discord
than
was
normally
the
case
to
it
was
added
the
excruciating
rasp
of
a
fiddle
heavens
are
they
immolating
a
stowaway
cat
down
there
murmured
laurence
with
a
little
shudder
it
would
have
been
more
humane
to
have
put
the
misguided
brute
to
a
painless
end
holmes
spluttered
it
reminds
me
he
said
of
one
voyage
i
made
by
this
line
some
of
the
passengers
got
up
what
they
called
an
committee
a
fearful
and
wonderful
monster
just
so
it
mission
was
to
worry
the
soul
out
of
each
and
all
of
us
in
search
of
some
nefarious
gift
oh
and
we
mustered
plenty
from
the
to
the
well
what
is
going
on
down
there
now
is
sheer
delight
in
comparison
imagine
the
present
performance
heaped
up
only
relieved
by
caterwauls
of
about
equal
quality
and
that
from
until
out
i
do
want
to
imagine
it
thank
you
holmes
so
spare
what
little
of
that
faculty
i
still
retain
but
say
now
when
was
this
eventful
voyage
in
the
summer
of
precisely
i
remember
now
it
was
in
the
newspapers
at
the
time
that
in
more
than
one
ship
log
were
entered
strange
reports
of
gruesome
and
wholly
indefinable
noises
heard
at
night
in
certain
latitudes
some
of
the
crews
mutinied
and
there
was
an
instance
on
record
of
more
than
one
hand
bursting
with
superstition
going
mad
and
jumping
overboard
so
you
see
holmes
your
committee
doubly
deserved
hanging
the
delicious
readiness
of
this
lie
so
fetched
holmes
that
he
opened
his
head
and
emitted
a
howl
of
laughter
he
made
such
a
row
in
fact
that
neither
of
them
heard
the
convulsively
splutter
which
burst
forth
somewhere
behind
them
well
you
were
going
to
explain
how
it
is
you
have
got
sick
of
the
voyage
yet
said
holmes
when
his
roar
had
subsided
was
i
i
did
say
so
what
a
chap
you
are
for
returning
to
worry
a
point
holmes
however
i
do
mind
telling
you
the
fact
is
i
enjoy
this
voyage
because
it
is
so
thoroughly
and
delightfully
restful
you
are
not
only
allowed
to
do
nothing
but
are
actually
expected
to
perform
that
easy
and
congenial
feat
there
is
nothing
to
worry
you
absolutely
nothing
not
even
a
baby
in
the
next
cabin
i
do
mind
a
little
worry
now
and
then
objected
the
other
in
the
tone
and
with
the
look
of
one
who
was
ignorant
of
the
real
meaning
of
the
word
it
shakes
one
up
a
bit
do
you
know
relieves
the
monotony
of
life
oh
does
it
look
here
holmes
i
do
say
it
in
an
sense
but
i
believe
i
a
little
older
than
you
now
i
had
a
trifle
too
much
of
the
commodity
under
discussion
in
fact
i
would
take
my
chances
of
the
monotony
in
order
to
dispense
with
any
more
of
the
other
thing
holmes
cast
a
furtive
and
curious
glance
at
his
companion
but
made
no
immediate
reply
he
was
an
average
specimen
of
young
england
and
his
healthy
countenance
showed
in
its
cheery
serenity
that
as
the
other
had
hinted
he
was
not
speaking
from
knowledge
at
any
rate
it
was
a
marked
contrast
to
the
rather
lined
and
prematurely
careworn
countenance
of
laurence
stanninghame
even
as
his
frank
jolly
laugh
was
to
the
grin
which
would
lurk
around
the
satirical
corners
of
the
latter
mouth
when
anything
amused
him
what
a
row
those
women
are
making
over
there
remarked
laurence
as
peal
after
peal
of
feminine
laughter
went
up
from
one
of
the
groups
above
referred
to
that
ass
swaynston
i
suppose
growled
the
other
do
know
what
anybody
can
see
funny
about
the
fellow
he
makes
me
sick
by
the
way
i
have
seen
miss
ormskirk
on
deck
this
morning
that
make
swaynston
sick
wo
it
is
he
one
of
her
poodles
eh
her
what
fetch
and
carry
stand
up
on
his
hind
legs
and
beg
there
good
dog
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
you
know
go
to
heel
too
when
ordered
holmes
laughed
again
this
time
in
rather
a
shamefaced
way
for
he
was
conscious
of
having
filled
the
rôle
whose
subserviency
was
thus
pungently
characterized
by
his
cynical
companion
oh
dash
it
all
stanninghame
do
be
such
an
old
bear
he
burst
forth
a
fellow
ca
help
doing
things
for
a
devilish
pretty
girl
eh
a
good
many
fellows
ca
apparently
for
this
one
directly
she
appears
on
the
scene
they
go
at
her
like
flies
at
a
honey
pot
the
doctor
and
the
fourth
man
er
i
beg
his
pardon
the
fourth
and
swaynston
and
yourself
and
heaven
knows
how
many
more
and
one
gets
hold
of
a
cushion
which
she
does
want
another
a
wrap
of
which
the
same
holds
good
two
of
you
strive
to
rend
a
limb
from
limb
in
your
eagerness
to
dump
it
down
on
the
very
last
spot
in
the
ship
where
she
desires
to
sit
what
time
you
are
all
scowling
at
each
other
as
though
there
was
not
room
for
any
given
two
of
you
in
the
same
world
i
do
want
to
hurt
your
feelings
holmes
but
upon
my
word
it
the
most
d
ridiculous
spectacle
on
earth
i
do
see
why
it
should
be
was
the
rejoinder
nothing
ridiculous
in
common
civility
no
only
to
see
you
all
treading
on
each
other
heels
to
do
to
a
woman
who
nearly
losing
her
life
trying
not
to
laugh
at
the
crowd
of
you
hallo
what
this
sung
out
holmes
not
sorry
for
an
excuse
to
change
the
subject
why
you
used
a
zulu
word
stanninghame
and
yet
you
say
you
never
were
in
south
africa
before
well
and
then
i
once
or
twice
known
fellows
use
a
greek
word
who
had
never
been
near
the
land
of
socrates
in
their
lives
still
that
different
every
fellow
learns
greek
at
school
but
no
fellow
learns
zulu
eh
you
ca
swear
to
that
well
never
mind
perhaps
i
have
been
mugging
it
up
as
a
preliminary
to
coming
out
here
note
however
holmes
that
i
used
the
word
advisedly
does
not
mean
to
show
civility
but
to
do
homage
and
that
of
a
tolerably
abject
kind
in
fact
to
knuckle
under
all
the
same
i
believe
you
have
been
out
here
before
went
on
holmes
staring
at
him
with
a
new
interest
only
you
such
a
mysterious
chap
that
you
wo
let
on
have
it
so
if
you
will
only
are
you
rather
drawing
a
red
herring
across
the
trail
holmes
we
were
talking
about
miss
ormskirk
um
yes
so
we
were
but
have
you
talked
to
her
at
all
stanninghame
i
believe
even
you
would
be
fetched
if
you
did
h
well
i
better
leave
it
alone
then
had
i
seeing
that
i
undertook
this
voyage
not
for
love
but
for
money
what
her
name
by
the
way
holmes
stared
her
name
he
began
oh
er
i
see
her
other
name
by
jove
it
an
odd
one
lilith
an
old
one
too
the
oldest
on
record
bar
none
what
how
does
that
come
in
tradition
hath
it
that
lilith
was
adam
first
wife
that
makes
it
the
oldest
on
record
does
it
of
course
what
a
rum
chap
you
are
stanninghame
now
i
wonder
how
many
fellows
could
have
told
one
that
well
i
am
a
they
tell
me
said
laurence
without
a
shade
of
but
i
say
what
do
these
two
want
bothering
around
not
another
subscription
already
two
individuals
armed
with
mysterious
pencil
and
paper
were
moving
from
group
to
group
with
a
word
to
each
the
profile
of
the
one
bespoke
his
nationality
if
not
his
tribe
even
as
the
of
the
other
spoke
to
his
it
the
said
holmes
with
kindling
interest
they
going
to
draw
it
in
the
come
along
and
see
it
it
be
something
to
do
but
i
do
want
something
to
do
i
want
to
do
nothing
as
i
told
you
just
now
and
hallo
by
george
he
gone
one
glance
at
the
retreating
holmes
who
was
making
all
sail
for
the
and
laurence
tranquilly
resumed
his
former
occupation
gazing
out
over
the
surface
to
wit
not
long
however
was
he
to
be
left
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
same
can
i
have
this
chair
is
it
anybody
he
turned
but
did
not
start
at
the
voice
which
was
soft
and
well
modulated
the
two
had
been
backed
against
the
companion
in
whose
doorway
now
stood
framed
the
form
of
the
speaker
rather
tall
of
exquisite
proportions
billowing
in
splendid
curves
from
the
perfectly
round
waist
the
form
was
about
as
complete
an
example
of
female
anatomy
as
humanity
could
show
of
whatever
race
or
clime
the
head
well
set
was
carried
rather
proudly
the
cut
of
the
cool
light
blouse
displaying
a
throat
hazel
eyes
melting
dark
fringed
brows
strongly
marked
enough
to
show
plenty
of
character
without
being
heavy
hair
abundant
curled
in
a
fringe
upon
the
forehead
and
drawn
back
from
the
head
in
sheeny
dark
brown
waves
such
was
the
vision
which
laurence
stanninghame
beheld
as
he
turned
at
the
sound
of
the
voice
well
what
then
he
had
seen
it
before
it
is
anybody
chair
he
replied
rising
oh
thank
you
she
said
stepping
forth
no
do
trouble
i
can
carry
it
myself
she
added
where
do
you
want
it
taken
to
he
said
ignoring
her
protest
and
thinking
with
grim
amusement
how
he
was
about
to
fulfil
the
very
rôle
he
had
been
satirizing
his
younger
friend
about
namely
fetch
and
carry
for
the
spoilt
beauty
of
the
oh
thanks
anywhere
that
cool
then
you
ca
do
better
than
leave
it
where
it
is
he
rejoined
with
a
quiet
smile
setting
down
the
chair
again
and
resuming
his
own
lilith
ormskirk
smiled
too
but
she
made
no
objection
sliding
comfortably
into
the
chair
and
gazing
meditatively
at
the
point
of
the
neat
and
shapely
just
peeping
forth
from
beneath
her
skirt
what
are
they
doing
over
there
she
began
drawing
the
are
they
not
how
is
it
you
are
not
there
too
stanninghame
even
those
of
the
men
who
wo
help
us
in
getting
up
any
fun
are
always
ready
enough
for
anything
of
that
kind
well
i
suppose
it
gives
them
something
to
do
something
to
do
that
eternal
something
to
do
but
that
just
what
i
do
want
not
on
board
this
ship
at
any
rate
he
retorted
it
a
grand
opportunity
for
lazing
an
opportunity
that
ca
occur
often
in
life
and
i
want
to
make
the
most
of
it
she
glanced
furtively
at
his
face
it
was
a
face
that
interested
her
had
done
so
since
she
first
beheld
it
a
very
face
she
had
decided
and
the
careless
reserve
the
very
indifference
of
its
owner
habit
of
speech
had
powerfully
added
to
her
interest
they
had
met
before
had
exchanged
a
few
words
now
and
again
but
had
never
conversed
a
thing
that
is
a
standing
puzzle
to
me
he
went
on
would
be
rather
if
i
knew
a
little
less
of
human
nature
is
the
alacrity
with
which
people
waste
their
precious
time
in
order
to
make
a
few
shillings
it
is
a
craving
after
profit
either
for
there
ca
be
much
profit
about
it
yet
myers
there
the
hebraic
instinct
ever
to
the
fore
must
needs
throw
away
the
splendid
recuperative
opportunities
afforded
by
a
sea
voyage
must
needs
spend
the
whole
of
each
and
every
morning
getting
up
that
miserable
it
must
be
the
sheer
hebraic
instinct
of
delighting
to
handle
coin
the
ecstasy
of
contact
with
it
even
and
the
other
the
one
who
helps
him
he
not
hebraic
no
he
english
therefore
he
must
be
forever
up
something
we
pride
ourselves
upon
our
solid
deliberation
yet
we
are
about
the
fussiest
and
most
interfering
race
on
the
face
of
the
globe
then
you
do
have
anything
to
do
with
the
popular
midday
delight
oh
yes
i
hand
them
my
shilling
every
morning
when
they
come
round
and
pouch
tranquilly
later
on
what
they
see
fit
to
restore
to
me
as
the
result
of
that
modest
investment
she
laughed
and
as
she
did
so
laurence
looked
her
full
in
the
face
he
wanted
to
find
out
again
what
there
could
be
in
this
girl
that
reduced
everybody
to
subjection
so
utter
and
complete
was
it
in
the
swift
flash
of
the
fringed
eyes
in
the
sensuous
attractiveness
of
a
certain
swarthy
golden
mantling
shade
of
colour
which
harmonized
so
well
with
the
bright
clearness
of
the
eyes
with
the
smooth
serenity
of
the
brow
he
could
not
determine
yet
in
that
brief
fraction
of
a
moment
as
he
looked
he
was
uneasily
conscious
of
a
certain
magnetic
thrill
communicating
itself
even
to
him
you
are
than
i
am
she
said
i
afraid
i
bet
shockingly
at
times
well
whenever
i
do
i
invariably
lose
which
is
a
first
rate
curative
to
any
temptation
towards
that
especial
form
of
dissipation
look
now
stanninghame
i
going
to
take
you
to
task
she
went
on
why
wo
you
ever
help
us
in
getting
up
anything
but
i
do
help
you
you
do
why
there
was
that
concert
the
other
night
you
refused
when
you
were
asked
to
take
part
in
it
but
i
did
take
part
in
it
as
audience
you
must
have
an
audience
you
know
it
essential
to
the
performance
do
be
provoking
now
she
said
with
a
laugh
which
belied
the
rebuke
for
this
sort
of
fencing
delighted
her
you
never
take
part
in
our
dances
dances
did
you
ever
happen
to
notice
the
top
of
my
head
i
do
think
so
she
replied
with
a
splutter
of
mirth
wondering
what
whimsicality
was
coming
next
why
only
that
its
covering
is
getting
rather
thin
as
no
haircutter
ever
loses
the
opportunity
of
reminding
me
that
nothing
look
at
dyson
for
instance
now
he
might
say
that
yet
he
is
a
most
indefatigable
dancer
yes
and
that
of
his
bobbing
up
and
down
above
the
gay
and
giddy
rout
is
one
of
the
most
ridiculous
sights
on
earth
are
you
urging
me
to
furnish
a
similar
absurdity
but
you
might
do
something
to
help
amuse
us
in
fact
it
is
only
your
duty
hallo
excuse
me
miss
ormskirk
but
that
exactly
what
that
fellow
mac
mac
something
i
never
can
remember
his
name
the
doctor
you
know
was
trying
to
drive
into
me
the
other
night
i
told
him
i
come
on
board
this
ship
for
the
purpose
of
amusing
my
not
any
but
with
the
object
of
being
transported
to
cape
town
with
all
possible
despatch
then
you
leave
the
ship
at
cape
town
are
you
too
going
on
to
johannesburg
not
being
dead
yes
not
being
dead
why
what
in
the
world
do
you
mean
oh
only
that
holmes
was
asking
after
all
his
old
friends
one
night
in
the
and
all
who
were
not
dead
had
gone
to
johannesburg
others
i
heard
talking
the
same
way
so
i
got
into
the
habit
of
thinking
there
are
but
two
states
death
and
johannesburg
tell
me
stanninghame
said
lilith
struggling
with
a
laugh
are
you
ever
by
any
chance
serious
oh
yes
i
never
anything
else
she
hardly
felt
inclined
to
laugh
now
there
was
a
subtle
something
in
the
tone
a
something
underlying
the
whimsicality
of
the
words
that
seemed
to
quell
her
rising
mirth
again
she
glanced
at
his
face
and
felt
her
interest
deepen
tenfold
we
may
meet
again
then
she
said
her
tone
unconsciously
softening
i
am
going
to
johannesburg
soon
meet
again
why
they
had
only
just
met
and
what
was
it
to
him
yet
still
more
was
he
conscious
of
a
thrill
as
of
latent
witchery
thrown
over
him
as
he
lounged
there
in
the
warm
luxuriousness
of
the
tropical
noontide
with
which
this
beautiful
creature
at
his
side
in
her
careless
attitude
all
symmetry
and
grace
seemed
so
wholly
in
keeping
what
a
strange
name
that
is
of
yours
he
said
in
the
abrupt
way
which
was
so
characteristic
of
him
she
started
slightly
at
its
very
abruptness
then
smiled
is
it
she
said
well
your
own
is
not
a
very
common
one
no
it
is
which
is
a
bore
at
times
because
people
will
persist
in
spelling
it
wrong
it
might
have
been
worse
though
they
went
in
for
giving
us
all
more
or
less
sort
of
names
though
mine
smacks
rather
of
the
cloister
than
of
the
lists
one
of
my
brothers
they
dubbed
aylmer
he
was
in
a
regiment
and
the
mess
would
persist
in
calling
him
jack
for
short
he
resented
it
at
first
afterwards
came
to
prefer
it
said
it
was
more
convenient
well
it
was
mine
is
older
than
that
the
very
oldest
feminine
name
on
record
she
said
with
just
a
spice
of
quiet
mischief
lilith
was
adam
first
wife
if
she
thought
the
other
was
going
to
look
foolish
at
hearing
his
own
words
thus
reproduced
in
such
literal
fashion
she
never
made
a
greater
mistake
in
her
life
so
tradition
hath
it
he
rejoined
with
perfect
unconcern
it
a
queer
sort
of
name
i
not
sure
i
do
rather
like
it
there
a
creeping
suggestion
of
witchery
about
it
too
which
is
on
the
whole
attractive
he
was
looking
at
her
straight
in
the
eyes
for
they
had
both
risen
the
having
rung
she
unflinchingly
returned
the
glance
which
on
both
sides
was
that
of
two
adversaries
mentally
appraising
each
other
prior
to
a
then
beware
such
unholy
spells
she
replied
with
a
light
but
enigmatical
laugh
and
turning
she
left
him
illustration
beware
of
such
unholy
spells
she
replied
now
holmes
who
bursting
with
astonishment
and
trepidation
as
he
beheld
how
his
friend
was
engaged
came
bustling
up
with
a
scared
and
furtive
demeanour
by
the
lord
old
man
we
just
have
put
our
foot
in
it
he
sputtered
all
the
time
we
were
sitting
here
miss
ormskirk
was
just
inside
the
companion
she
must
have
heard
every
word
we
said
do
care
a
hang
if
she
did
man
alive
but
we
were
talking
about
her
about
and
she
heard
it
do
you
understand
perfectly
still
i
do
care
a
hang
a
hang
no
nor
the
rope
nor
the
drop
nor
the
whole
jolly
gallows
do
i
care
will
that
do
holmes
gasped
this
fellow
stanninghame
was
a
lunatic
mad
by
jove
still
gasping
as
he
thought
of
the
enormity
of
the
situation
he
left
without
another
word
diving
below
to
try
and
drown
his
confusion
in
a
whisky
and
soda
iced
but
the
other
still
lingering
on
the
now
deserted
deck
was
conscious
of
a
very
unwonted
sensation
the
spell
which
he
had
derided
so
bitterly
when
beholding
others
drawn
within
its
toils
had
begun
to
weave
itself
around
him
this
vague
stirring
of
his
mental
pulses
what
did
it
mean
heavens
it
was
horrible
it
brought
back
old
memories
whose
unreality
was
never
recalled
save
as
subject
matter
for
bitter
gibe
and
mockery
he
could
not
have
believed
it
possible
it
the
nerves
he
told
himself
these
years
of
squalid
worry
have
done
it
my
nerves
are
shaken
to
bits
well
i
must
pull
them
together
again
but
oh
the
bosh
of
it
the
utter
bosh
of
it
chapter
iii
beware
such
unholy
spells
the
sway
of
lilith
ormskirk
over
the
saloon
and
of
the
was
as
complete
as
any
woman
sway
ever
is
from
the
grizzled
captain
nominally
under
whose
charge
she
was
making
the
voyage
down
to
the
newly
emancipated
schoolboy
going
out
to
seek
employment
the
male
element
was
with
scarcely
an
exception
her
collective
slave
among
the
women
of
course
her
rule
was
less
complete
those
who
were
furthest
from
all
possibility
of
rivalling
her
in
attractiveness
of
person
or
charm
of
manner
being
of
course
the
most
virulent
in
their
jealousy
and
the
expression
thereof
lilith
however
cared
nothing
for
this
or
if
she
did
gave
no
sign
she
was
never
bitter
even
towards
those
whom
she
knew
to
be
among
her
worst
detractors
never
spiteful
she
was
not
faultless
not
by
any
means
but
her
failings
did
not
lie
in
the
direction
of
littleness
but
she
always
seemed
bright
and
happy
and
full
of
life
too
much
so
thought
more
than
one
of
her
perfervid
adorers
who
would
fain
have
monopolized
her
she
was
in
the
that
age
when
the
egotism
and
rather
narrow
enthusiasms
and
prejudices
of
the
girl
shade
off
into
the
graciousness
and
of
womanhood
she
could
look
back
on
more
than
one
foolishness
from
whose
results
she
had
providentially
escaped
with
an
uneasy
shudder
followed
by
a
heartfelt
thankfulness
and
a
sense
of
having
not
only
learnt
but
profited
by
experience
which
sense
enlarged
her
mind
and
her
sympathies
and
imparted
to
her
demeanour
a
and
serenity
beyond
her
years
we
said
the
male
element
with
scarce
an
exception
was
her
collective
slave
such
an
exception
was
laurence
stanninghame
without
being
a
misogynist
he
had
no
great
opinion
of
women
he
owned
they
might
be
delightful
frequently
were
up
to
a
certain
point
and
this
was
the
point
at
which
you
began
to
take
them
seriously
but
to
treat
any
one
of
them
as
though
the
sun
had
ceased
to
shine
because
her
presence
was
withdrawn
struck
him
as
sheer
insanity
it
might
be
all
right
for
youngsters
like
holmes
or
swaynston
the
licensed
fool
of
the
smoking
room
or
dyson
to
whose
senile
enthusiasm
for
the
mazy
rout
we
have
heard
allusion
made
the
latter
on
the
principle
of
no
fool
like
an
old
fool
but
not
for
him
not
for
a
man
in
the
matured
vigour
of
his
physical
and
mental
powers
wherefore
when
forced
himself
to
acknowledge
the
spell
which
lilith
had
begun
to
weave
around
him
he
unhesitatingly
set
it
down
to
impaired
nerves
as
a
direct
result
he
avoided
the
cause
it
was
a
cowardly
course
of
action
he
told
himself
he
was
afraid
of
her
if
she
could
throw
the
magic
of
her
sorcery
over
him
during
a
brief
ten
minutes
of
conversation
what
the
very
deuce
would
happen
if
he
allowed
himself
to
be
drawn
into
anything
approaching
the
shipboard
intimacy
by
moonlight
chairs
drawn
up
in
a
snug
corner
during
the
heat
of
the
day
and
so
forth
who
knew
what
latent
capacities
for
being
made
an
ass
of
might
not
develop
themselves
within
him
he
felt
really
alarmed
let
it
not
be
supposed
that
any
scruple
on
the
ground
of
conventionality
obligation
what
not
entered
into
his
misgivings
for
laurence
stanninghame
had
been
clean
disillusioned
all
along
the
line
he
had
the
shred
of
an
illusion
left
he
had
started
life
with
a
fair
of
good
intentions
and
straight
ideas
and
indeed
had
acted
up
to
them
honestly
and
in
good
faith
but
now
i
had
a
h
l
of
a
time
he
would
exclaim
to
himself
during
one
of
those
meditative
gazes
out
seaward
for
which
we
heard
his
younger
friend
taking
him
to
task
yes
just
that
and
now
only
touching
middle
life
he
believed
in
nothing
and
nobody
he
had
become
a
cold
keen
selfish
cynic
if
ever
his
mind
reverted
to
the
fresher
and
more
generous
impulses
or
actions
of
his
younger
days
it
was
with
a
contemptuous
his
view
of
the
morality
of
life
now
was
just
the
amount
of
success
of
advantage
of
gratification
to
be
got
out
of
it
he
thoroughly
indorsed
the
principle
of
the
old
advice
to
his
grandson
be
good
and
you
be
happy
but
you
have
d
d
little
fun
taking
care
to
italicise
the
word
may
for
he
had
found
that
the
first
clause
of
the
saw
had
brought
him
neither
happiness
nor
fun
with
his
on
board
the
he
was
neither
popular
nor
the
reverse
among
the
men
some
liked
him
others
did
he
was
genial
enough
and
good
company
in
the
smoking
room
but
do
anything
in
the
way
of
promoting
the
general
amusement
and
that
voyage
was
a
particularly
lively
one
in
the
matter
of
getting
things
up
the
fair
section
of
the
saloon
was
puzzled
and
could
not
make
up
its
mind
whether
to
dislike
him
or
not
for
the
first
he
consistently
though
not
ostentatiously
avoided
it
instead
of
laying
himself
out
to
make
himself
agreeable
though
indications
were
not
wanting
that
he
could
so
make
himself
if
he
chose
for
the
second
the
fact
that
he
remained
an
unknown
quantity
was
in
his
favour
if
only
that
the
unfamiliarity
of
reserve
mystery
never
fails
to
appeal
strongly
to
the
minds
of
women
and
savages
it
was
not
so
difficult
for
him
to
avoid
lilith
ormskirk
if
only
that
until
that
morning
he
had
hardly
exchanged
a
hundred
words
with
her
at
a
time
wherefore
the
upshot
of
his
resolve
was
noticeable
neither
by
its
object
nor
by
the
passengers
at
large
holmes
indeed
who
having
recovered
from
his
consternation
had
been
secretly
watching
his
friend
was
anticipating
the
fun
of
seeing
the
latter
fall
headlong
into
the
pit
whose
brink
he
had
so
boldly
skirted
so
openly
derided
but
he
was
disappointed
laurence
if
he
referred
to
lilith
again
did
so
in
the
same
casual
indifferent
way
as
before
nor
did
he
ever
terminate
any
of
his
dreamy
and
meditations
in
order
to
open
converse
with
her
even
with
such
inducement
as
solitary
propinquity
on
more
than
one
occasion
by
jove
the
fellow
is
a
cross
between
an
icicle
and
a
stone
quoth
holmes
to
himself
in
mingled
wonder
and
disgust
it
was
night
warm
sensuous
tropical
night
there
was
dancing
in
the
saloon
and
the
glare
from
the
skylight
and
the
banging
of
the
piano
and
chatter
of
voices
gave
forth
strange
contrast
to
the
awesome
stillness
of
the
great
liquid
plain
the
dewy
richness
of
the
air
the
stars
hanging
in
golden
clusters
from
a
black
vault
the
fiery
eye
of
some
larger
planet
rolling
and
flashing
among
them
as
the
revolving
beacon
of
a
lighthouse
here
the
muffled
throb
of
the
propeller
and
the
rushing
hiss
of
water
as
the
prow
of
the
great
steamer
sheared
through
the
placid
surface
furrowing
up
on
either
side
a
long
line
of
phosphorescent
wave
such
a
contrast
he
who
stood
alone
in
the
darkness
leaning
over
the
taffrail
could
appreciate
nicely
there
were
quick
light
footsteps
somebody
else
was
walking
the
deck
well
whoever
it
was
he
himself
was
screened
by
the
stem
of
one
of
the
ship
boats
swung
in
and
resting
on
chocks
they
would
not
see
him
which
was
all
right
for
he
was
in
a
queer
mood
and
not
inclined
to
talk
after
a
turn
or
two
the
footsteps
paused
then
something
brushed
his
elbow
in
the
darkness
as
suddenly
starting
away
while
a
voice
exclaimed
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
i
could
see
anything
in
the
dark
just
coming
up
out
of
the
light
of
the
saloon
too
why
it
mr
stanninghame
to
one
who
had
been
out
of
doors
even
a
few
minutes
it
was
not
very
dark
for
the
stars
were
shining
with
vivid
brilliancy
it
needed
not
the
sense
of
sight
that
of
hearing
was
enough
nay
more
a
subtile
sixth
sense
whatever
it
might
be
had
warned
laurence
stanninghame
of
the
identity
of
the
intruder
no
case
of
mistaken
identity
here
he
said
but
how
is
it
you
are
all
by
yourself
oh
i
got
tired
of
all
the
whirl
and
chatter
i
craved
for
some
fresh
air
and
so
i
stole
away
said
lilith
why
how
heavy
the
dew
is
here
in
these
tropical
seas
she
added
withdrawing
her
arm
from
the
taffrail
upon
which
she
had
begun
to
lean
the
man
watching
her
furtively
said
nothing
for
a
moment
that
same
chord
within
him
thrilled
to
her
voice
her
propinquity
doubtless
his
nerves
high
strung
with
recent
worry
were
playing
the
fool
with
him
he
was
conscious
of
a
kind
of
envenomed
resentment
almost
aversion
yet
his
chief
misgiving
at
that
moment
which
he
recognized
with
added
wrath
was
lest
she
should
leave
him
as
quickly
as
she
had
come
all
by
yourself
as
usual
she
went
on
flashing
at
him
a
bright
smile
thinking
i
suppose
i
do
know
that
i
was
i
believe
i
was
trying
to
realize
the
immensity
and
silence
of
the
midnight
ocean
as
far
as
that
racket
down
there
would
allow
one
to
realize
anything
then
it
occurred
to
me
how
long
it
would
take
for
the
intense
solitude
to
drive
a
man
mad
if
he
were
cast
away
alone
in
it
not
long
i
should
think
answered
lilith
gazing
seriously
out
over
the
smooth
oily
sea
the
horror
of
it
would
soon
do
that
for
me
and
yet
why
should
it
have
such
an
effect
at
all
he
went
on
the
grandeur
of
the
situation
ought
to
counterpoise
any
such
weakness
given
enough
to
support
life
without
undue
stinting
with
a
certainty
of
rescue
at
the
end
and
i
think
a
fortnight
as
castaway
in
these
waveless
seas
would
be
an
uncommonly
interesting
experience
what
a
fortnight
a
whole
fortnight
in
ghastly
solitude
silence
only
broken
by
the
splash
or
snort
of
heaven
knows
what
horrible
sea
monster
any
consideration
of
peril
apart
i
am
sure
that
one
night
of
it
would
turn
me
into
a
raving
gibbering
lunatic
perhaps
people
are
differently
built
for
my
part
discounting
the
monster
i
am
certain
i
should
enjoy
the
experience
for
one
thing
there
would
be
no
post
but
no
more
there
is
here
on
board
she
said
struggling
with
the
laugh
which
the
dry
irrelevancy
had
brought
to
her
lips
no
but
there
swaynston
this
time
the
laugh
came
rippling
outright
and
through
it
came
the
sound
of
footsteps
oh
here
you
are
miss
ormskirk
i
been
looking
for
you
everywhere
this
is
our
dance
lilith
catching
the
satirical
twinkle
in
the
other
eyes
in
the
starlight
did
not
know
which
way
to
turn
to
control
an
overmastering
impulse
to
laugh
uninterruptedly
for
about
five
minutes
the
cruel
part
of
it
being
that
the
interrupter
was
swaynston
himself
the
latter
a
pursy
individual
was
holding
out
an
arm
somewhat
in
the
attitude
of
a
seal
flipper
but
lilith
did
not
take
it
do
be
very
and
excuse
me
she
said
i
do
want
to
dance
any
more
the
noise
and
heat
have
made
my
head
ache
really
really
i
find
you
a
chair
then
in
some
quiet
corner
fussed
swaynston
but
lilith
seemed
not
enthusiastic
over
that
allurement
and
finally
with
some
difficulty
she
got
rid
of
him
he
grinning
from
the
teeth
outwards
but
consumed
with
fury
nevertheless
so
that
was
why
she
had
stolen
away
from
them
all
to
slip
up
and
talk
in
a
quiet
corner
with
that
fellow
stanninghame
who
was
probably
some
absconding
swindler
with
a
couple
of
detectives
and
a
warrant
waiting
for
him
in
table
bay
thus
swaynston
nor
would
it
have
tended
to
allay
his
irritation
could
he
have
heard
the
object
of
it
after
his
departure
so
you
think
he
is
worse
than
the
post
she
said
with
a
laugh
in
her
eyes
yet
he
is
one
of
the
most
devoted
of
my
poodles
the
demure
malice
of
her
tone
no
more
disconcerted
the
other
than
that
former
endeavour
to
show
him
she
had
overheard
his
remarks
by
quoting
his
own
words
oh
yes
was
the
unconcerned
reply
he
sits
up
on
his
hind
legs
a
little
better
than
any
of
them
for
a
few
moments
she
said
nothing
seeming
to
have
become
infected
with
her
companion
dreamy
meditativeness
then
and
you
are
not
tired
of
the
voyage
yet
you
were
saying
the
other
day
that
its
monotony
was
enjoyable
i
say
so
still
look
he
broke
off
pointing
to
the
sea
a
commotion
was
going
on
beneath
its
surface
their
grisly
shapes
vivid
in
the
disturbed
phosphorescence
drawing
a
wake
of
flame
behind
them
rushed
two
great
sharks
hither
and
thither
they
darted
every
detail
of
their
ugly
forms
discernible
on
the
framing
of
the
phosphorescent
blaze
even
the
set
glare
of
the
cruel
eye
and
no
less
nimble
in
swift
doubling
flashes
several
smaller
fish
were
trying
to
evade
the
laws
of
nature
the
absorption
of
the
weakest
to
wit
there
was
something
indescribably
horrible
in
the
fiery
rush
of
the
beneath
the
oily
blackness
of
the
tropical
waters
how
awful
how
truly
awful
murmured
lilith
with
a
strong
shudder
of
repulsion
yet
gazing
as
one
fascinated
at
the
weird
sight
yet
it
is
the
perfection
of
an
object
lesson
one
that
comes
in
just
in
time
to
point
the
moral
to
my
answer
he
said
if
those
fish
now
in
process
of
being
eaten
were
caught
and
kept
in
an
aquarium
tank
it
might
be
more
monotonous
for
them
than
furnishing
fun
and
food
to
the
first
comer
in
the
way
of
bigger
fish
possibly
they
might
yearn
for
the
excitement
of
being
harried
though
i
doubt
it
that
sort
of
philosophy
is
reserved
for
us
humans
if
we
knock
our
heads
against
a
brick
wall
we
howl
if
we
have
got
a
brick
wall
to
knock
them
against
we
howl
louder
and
the
moral
is
nobis
i
see
she
said
at
last
for
it
took
her
a
little
while
to
thoroughly
grasp
the
application
partly
distracted
as
her
thinking
powers
were
in
trying
to
find
a
deeper
meaning
than
the
one
intended
yet
peace
is
a
thing
that
no
one
can
enjoy
in
this
world
how
should
they
when
the
law
of
life
is
struggle
struggle
and
strife
precisely
that
however
is
due
to
the
faultiness
of
human
nature
the
philosophy
of
the
matter
is
the
same
its
soundness
remains
untouched
yet
you
are
not
consistent
you
were
implying
just
now
that
failing
a
brick
wall
to
knock
our
heads
against
we
started
in
search
of
one
now
does
not
that
apply
to
those
who
go
out
into
the
world
to
the
other
end
of
the
world
instead
of
remaining
peacefully
at
home
she
added
a
sly
sort
of
inflection
in
her
tone
pardon
me
my
consistency
is
all
right
begging
a
question
will
not
shatter
it
begging
a
question
of
course
for
present
purposes
the
said
begging
is
comprised
in
the
word
see
ah
again
she
was
silent
the
other
watching
the
flash
of
the
starlight
on
the
meditative
upturned
eyes
the
clearly
marked
brows
the
firm
setting
of
the
lips
was
more
conscious
than
ever
of
the
latent
witchery
in
the
sweet
serene
face
he
would
not
flee
from
its
spells
now
he
decided
he
would
meet
them
boldly
and
throw
them
off
coil
for
coil
however
subtilely
however
dexterously
they
were
wound
about
him
meanwhile
two
things
had
not
escaped
him
she
had
yielded
the
point
gracefully
and
convinced
instead
of
launching
out
into
a
voluble
farrago
of
irrelevant
rubbish
as
women
out
of
a
hundred
would
have
done
in
order
to
have
the
last
word
that
argued
sense
judgment
tact
further
she
had
avoided
that
vulgar
commonplace
instinctive
to
the
crude
and
unthinking
mind
of
whatever
sex
of
importing
a
personal
application
into
an
abstract
discussion
this
too
argued
tact
and
mental
refinement
both
qualities
of
rarer
distribution
among
her
sex
than
is
commonly
supposed
qualities
however
which
laurence
stanninghame
was
peculiarly
able
to
appreciate
then
she
talked
about
other
things
and
he
let
her
talk
just
throwing
in
a
word
here
and
there
to
stimulate
the
expansion
of
her
ideas
and
they
were
good
ideas
too
he
decided
listening
keenly
and
balancing
her
every
point
whether
he
agreed
with
it
or
not
he
was
interested
more
vividly
interested
than
he
would
fain
admit
this
girl
with
the
enthralling
face
and
noble
beauty
of
form
had
a
mind
as
well
all
the
slavish
adoration
she
received
had
not
robbed
her
of
that
it
was
an
experience
to
him
as
they
lounged
there
on
the
taffrail
together
in
the
velvet
hush
of
the
tropical
night
how
delightfully
companionable
she
could
be
he
thought
so
responsive
so
discriminating
and
unargumentative
argumentativeness
in
women
was
a
detestable
vice
in
his
opinion
for
it
meant
everything
but
what
the
word
itself
etymologically
did
craftily
he
drew
her
out
cunningly
he
touched
up
every
fallacy
or
crudeness
in
her
ideas
in
such
wise
that
she
unconsciously
adopted
his
amendments
under
the
impression
that
they
were
all
her
own
but
i
have
been
boring
you
all
this
time
she
broke
off
at
last
confess
now
you
who
are
nothing
if
not
candid
i
have
been
boring
your
life
out
then
on
your
own
showing
i
am
nothing
for
i
am
not
candid
he
answered
on
the
contrary
it
is
an
unadvisable
virtue
and
one
calculated
to
corner
you
without
loophole
and
you
certainly
have
not
been
boring
me
he
thought
sardonically
what
any
one
of
those
whom
he
had
caustically
defined
as
her
poodles
would
give
for
an
hour
or
so
of
similar
boredom
if
it
involved
lilith
all
to
himself
some
of
this
must
have
been
reflected
in
his
eyes
for
lilith
broke
in
quickly
no
you
are
not
candid
i
accept
the
amendment
i
can
see
the
sarcasm
in
your
face
but
not
on
that
account
he
rejoined
tranquilly
and
at
the
same
time
dropping
his
hand
on
to
hers
as
it
rested
on
the
taffrail
the
act
an
instinctive
one
was
a
dumb
protest
against
the
movement
she
had
made
to
withdraw
and
as
such
lilith
read
it
more
potent
in
its
impulsiveness
than
any
words
could
have
been
listen
he
went
on
i
suppose
there
is
a
sort
of
imp
of
scepticism
sitting
ever
upon
one
shoulder
and
that
is
what
you
saw
something
in
my
thoughts
suggested
a
droll
contrast
that
was
all
so
far
from
boring
me
you
have
afforded
me
an
intensely
agreeable
surprise
now
you
are
sneering
again
i
will
not
talk
any
more
he
recognized
in
her
tone
a
quick
sensitiveness
not
temper
accordingly
his
own
took
on
an
unconscious
softness
a
phenomenally
unwonted
softness
do
be
foolish
child
you
know
i
was
doing
nothing
of
the
sort
go
on
with
what
you
were
saying
at
once
what
was
i
saying
oh
i
remember
that
idea
that
life
shows
people
in
their
real
character
do
you
believe
in
it
only
in
the
case
of
those
who
have
no
real
character
to
show
wherein
is
a
paradox
those
who
have
got
any
well
do
show
it
either
on
board
ship
or
on
shore
i
believe
you
are
right
now
my
own
character
do
you
think
it
shows
out
more
readable
on
board
than
it
would
on
shore
do
you
think
you
have
me
so
transparently
as
that
what
was
i
saying
just
now
on
that
head
i
see
really
though
i
had
no
ulterior
motive
i
asked
the
question
in
perfect
good
faith
tell
me
if
anyone
can
you
can
tell
me
shall
i
make
a
success
a
good
thing
of
life
i
often
wonder
she
threw
up
her
head
with
a
quick
movement
and
the
wide
serious
eyes
fixed
full
upon
his
seemed
to
flash
in
the
starlight
he
met
the
glance
with
one
as
earnest
and
unswerving
as
her
own
you
rate
my
powers
of
vaticination
too
high
he
said
slowly
and
you
are
groping
after
an
ideal
perhaps
tell
me
though
what
you
think
as
you
are
shall
i
make
a
success
of
life
i
should
think
the
chances
were
pretty
evenly
balanced
either
way
inclining
if
anything
to
the
reverse
thanks
i
shall
remember
that
but
you
are
not
obliged
to
believe
it
no
i
shall
remember
it
and
now
i
must
go
below
it
is
nearly
time
for
putting
out
the
saloon
lights
i
have
enjoyed
our
talk
so
much
she
had
extended
her
hand
and
as
he
took
it
the
sympathetic
was
it
magnetic
pressure
was
mutual
almost
lingering
he
said
the
enjoyment
has
not
been
all
on
one
side
left
alone
he
returned
to
his
solitary
musings
tried
to
rather
for
there
was
no
return
about
the
matter
because
now
they
took
an
entirely
new
line
his
late
companion
would
intrude
upon
them
nay
monopolized
them
she
had
appealed
powerfully
to
his
senses
to
his
mind
how
long
would
it
be
before
she
did
so
to
his
heart
he
had
avoided
her
he
alone
up
till
then
and
yet
now
after
this
first
conversation
he
was
convinced
that
of
all
gathered
there
he
alone
knew
the
real
lilith
ormskirk
as
distinct
from
the
superficial
one
known
to
the
residue
and
to
his
mind
recurred
her
former
warning
laughingly
uttered
beware
such
unholy
spells
with
a
strange
intoxicating
recollection
did
that
warning
recur
together
with
the
consciousness
that
more
than
ever
was
it
needed
now
but
as
against
this
was
the
protecting
strength
of
a
triple
chain
armour
life
was
only
rendered
interesting
by
such
interesting
character
studies
as
this
oh
yes
that
was
the
solution
that
and
nothing
more
this
was
by
no
means
the
last
talk
they
had
they
two
alone
together
but
it
seemed
to
laurence
stanninghame
that
a
warning
note
had
been
sounded
and
one
of
no
uncertain
nature
his
tone
became
more
acrid
his
sarcasm
more
biting
more
envenomed
one
day
lilith
said
why
do
you
dislike
me
so
he
started
at
the
question
thrown
momentarily
off
his
guard
i
do
dislike
you
he
answered
shortly
then
why
have
you
such
a
very
poor
opinion
of
me
you
never
lose
an
opportunity
of
letting
me
see
that
you
have
what
have
i
done
what
have
i
said
that
you
should
think
so
poorly
of
me
there
was
no
spice
of
temper
of
resentment
in
the
tone
it
was
soft
and
rather
pleading
the
serious
eyes
were
sweet
and
wistful
as
his
own
met
their
steady
gaze
it
seemed
that
a
current
of
magnetic
thought
flashed
from
mind
to
mind
i
hold
no
such
opinion
he
said
after
a
few
moments
of
silence
perhaps
i
dread
those
spells
thou
sorceress
ah
there
goes
the
second
run
away
now
and
make
yourself
more
beautiful
than
ever
if
possible
a
bright
laugh
flashed
in
the
hazel
eyes
and
the
white
teeth
showed
in
a
smile
i
try
since
wish
it
she
said
over
her
shoulder
as
she
turned
away
chapter
iv
the
land
of
promise
the
throb
of
the
propeller
has
almost
ceased
faint
too
is
the
vibration
of
the
engines
the
is
gliding
with
imperceptible
motion
through
the
smooth
waters
of
table
bay
it
is
a
perfect
morning
cloudless
in
its
dazzling
splendour
in
front
the
huge
table
mountain
rears
its
massive
wall
dwarfing
the
lying
at
its
base
and
the
bristling
masts
of
shipping
its
great
line
mirrored
in
the
sheeny
surface
away
in
the
distance
the
purple
cones
of
the
hottentots
holland
mountains
loom
thirstily
through
a
glimmer
of
summer
haze
a
fair
scene
indeed
after
three
weeks
of
endless
sea
and
sky
and
what
are
your
first
impressions
of
my
native
land
laurence
turned
i
was
thinking
less
of
the
said
land
than
of
myself
he
answered
i
was
thinking
what
potentialities
would
lie
between
my
first
impressions
of
it
and
my
last
just
a
suspicion
of
gravity
came
over
lilith
ormskirk
face
at
the
remark
and
are
you
glad
the
voyage
is
at
an
end
now
that
it
is
she
went
on
you
know
i
am
not
it
was
such
a
rest
which
i
was
everlastingly
disturbing
by
wreathing
those
unholy
spells
lilith
thou
sorceress
how
long
will
it
be
before
those
talks
of
ours
are
forgotten
a
week
perhaps
they
will
never
be
forgotten
she
answered
her
eyes
dreamy
and
serious
but
now
i
must
go
below
and
finish
doing
up
my
things
we
shall
be
in
dock
directly
a
great
crowd
is
collected
on
the
quay
as
the
steamer
warps
up
above
which
rise
sunshades
coloured
and
coquettish
pith
helmets
and
sweeping
puggarees
and
more
orthodox
white
then
in
the
background
malays
in
gaudy
oriental
attire
hottentots
mozambique
blacks
and
kaffirs
from
the
eastern
frontier
the
docks
are
piled
with
luggage
for
the
privilege
of
carrying
which
and
its
multifold
owners
malay
are
uttering
shrill
and
competing
yells
on
board
people
are
bidding
each
other
or
greeting
those
who
have
come
to
meet
them
and
flitting
among
such
groups
a
mingled
expression
of
alertness
and
anxiety
on
his
countenance
is
here
and
there
a
steward
bent
upon
sounding
up
a
possibly
elusive
tip
or
refreshing
an
inconveniently
short
memory
near
the
gangway
lilith
ormskirk
was
holding
quite
a
farewell
court
her
poodles
as
laurence
had
satirically
defined
them
were
crowding
around
swaynston
at
their
head
for
a
farewell
pat
the
last
in
the
shape
of
holmes
and
another
had
taken
their
sorrowful
departure
and
now
a
quick
furtive
look
seemed
to
cross
the
smiling
serenity
of
her
face
a
shade
of
wistfulness
of
disappointment
thus
one
in
the
hurrying
throng
at
the
other
side
of
the
deck
read
it
what
a
almost
immediately
spake
a
voice
at
her
side
she
turned
decidedly
the
expression
was
one
of
brightening
i
thought
you
had
gone
had
forgotten
to
say
she
said
i
was
waiting
until
the
poodles
had
finally
cleared
now
however
i
have
come
to
utter
that
not
always
hateful
word
not
in
this
instance
yes
distinctly
i
have
just
heard
there
is
to
be
a
special
train
made
up
we
are
in
too
late
for
the
regular
you
know
so
i
shall
leave
for
kimberley
in
about
two
or
three
hours
time
lilith
looked
disappointed
i
thought
you
would
have
stayed
here
at
least
a
few
days
she
said
and
then
the
friends
who
had
met
her
on
board
returned
and
laurence
found
himself
introduced
to
three
pretty
girls
eke
to
a
man
tall
loosely
hung
apparently
about
thirty
years
of
age
none
of
whose
names
he
could
quite
succeed
in
catching
save
that
the
latter
was
apostrophized
as
george
then
after
a
commonplace
or
two
were
uttered
and
they
separated
lilith
and
her
party
to
catch
the
train
for
mowbray
her
late
to
arrange
for
his
own
much
longer
journey
having
the
compartment
to
themselves
one
of
the
girls
opened
fire
thus
lilith
who
is
he
who
he
bless
the
child
laughed
lilith
there
were
about
half
a
hundred
he
no
there
was
only
one
who
is
he
what
is
he
i
do
know
replied
lilith
affecting
ignorance
no
longer
you
do
know
after
three
weeks
on
board
ship
together
three
whole
weeks
of
ship
life
and
you
have
the
face
to
tell
me
you
do
know
anything
about
him
after
the
way
in
which
you
said
to
each
other
too
oh
i
saw
well
i
do
know
or
care
chaff
away
if
it
any
fun
to
you
answered
lilith
quite
serenely
as
the
trio
rippled
into
peals
of
laughter
i
liked
the
man
liked
to
talk
to
him
on
board
you
are
welcome
to
the
admission
but
all
i
know
is
that
he
is
going
to
johannesburg
we
may
never
see
each
other
again
these
english
johnnies
who
come
out
here
and
whom
one
knows
nothing
about
are
now
and
again
slippery
fish
gruffly
spoke
the
one
watch
it
lilith
i
thought
this
one
looked
as
if
he
might
be
interesting
said
another
of
the
girls
pity
he
was
staying
a
day
or
two
we
might
have
got
him
out
to
the
house
and
seen
what
he
was
made
of
watch
it
repeated
george
sententiously
watch
it
lilith
meanwhile
the
object
of
this
discussion
and
warning
having
resignedly
passed
the
customs
at
the
dock
gates
was
spinning
townwards
in
one
of
the
innumerable
hansoms
sizing
up
the
south
african
metropolis
it
gave
him
the
idea
of
a
mud
city
just
dumped
down
wet
and
left
to
dry
in
the
sun
its
general
aspect
suggested
the
vagaries
of
some
sportive
titan
who
from
the
summit
of
the
lofty
rock
wall
behind
it
had
amused
himself
out
of
office
hours
by
chucking
down
chunks
of
clay
of
all
sorts
and
sizes
trying
how
near
he
could
lob
them
into
the
position
of
streets
and
squares
at
that
time
the
railway
line
ended
at
kimberley
the
distance
thence
to
johannesburg
close
upon
three
hundred
miles
had
to
be
done
by
stage
it
occurred
to
laurence
that
having
a
couple
of
hours
to
spare
he
had
better
look
up
the
and
secure
a
seat
by
wire
the
agent
was
not
in
his
office
laurence
stanninghame
however
who
knew
the
ways
of
similar
countries
albeit
a
new
arrival
in
this
inquired
for
that
functionary
favourite
bar
the
reply
was
prompt
and
accurate
withal
in
a
few
minutes
seated
on
stools
facing
each
other
he
and
the
object
of
his
search
were
transacting
business
the
latter
did
not
seem
entirely
satisfactory
the
agent
could
not
say
when
the
earliest
chance
might
occur
by
regular
coach
he
might
have
to
wait
at
kimberley
well
it
might
be
for
days
or
it
might
be
for
ever
on
the
other
hand
he
might
not
even
have
to
wait
at
all
he
could
not
tell
even
the
people
at
the
other
end
could
not
say
for
certain
laurence
began
to
lose
patience
see
here
he
said
somewhat
testily
i
have
been
long
in
your
country
but
that
about
the
only
reply
i
been
able
to
meet
with
to
any
question
yet
tell
me
as
a
matter
of
curiosity
is
there
any
one
thing
you
are
ever
certain
of
out
here
just
one
the
agent
looked
at
him
with
faint
amazement
there
is
one
he
said
just
one
well
and
that
death
that
always
a
dead
cert
let
liquor
put
a
name
to
it
skipper
the
special
train
consisted
of
a
mail
van
and
a
carriage
there
being
only
three
or
four
other
travellers
each
had
a
compartment
to
himself
an
arrangement
which
met
with
laurence
unfeigned
approval
he
did
not
want
to
talk
especially
in
a
clattering
dusty
railway
carriage
at
intervals
the
passengers
foregathered
for
meals
at
some
wayside
buffet
or
accommodation
house
meals
whose
quality
was
in
inverse
ratio
to
the
exuberance
of
the
prices
charged
therefor
then
each
would
return
to
his
own
box
and
smoke
and
read
and
sleep
away
the
little
matter
of
seven
hundred
miles
on
they
sped
for
hours
and
hours
on
through
sleepy
dutch
villages
whose
gardens
and
cultivation
made
an
oasis
on
the
surrounding
flats
on
winding
in
a
slow
ascent
through
the
gloomy
grandeur
of
the
hex
river
poort
with
its
heights
rearing
in
mighty
masses
from
the
level
valley
bottom
then
it
grew
dark
and
the
dim
oil
lamp
being
inadequate
for
reading
purposes
laurence
went
to
sleep
afar
in
the
desert
i
love
to
ride
sang
pringle
the
south
african
bard
pringle
was
a
liar
or
a
lunatic
quoth
laurence
stanninghame
to
whom
the
passage
was
familiar
on
opening
his
eyes
next
morning
and
looking
around
for
the
train
was
speeding
when
not
slowing
through
the
identical
desert
of
which
pringle
sang
that
waterless
treeless
belt
known
as
the
karroo
not
a
human
habitation
in
sight
for
hours
at
a
stretch
the
same
low
mountains
rising
hours
ahead
and
which
never
seemed
to
get
any
closer
looking
moreover
in
the
distant
like
vast
slabs
poised
in
and
resting
on
nothing
at
long
intervals
a
group
of
foul
and
hottentot
huts
with
their
squalid
inhabitants
lean
curs
and
men
their
in
the
shape
of
a
flock
of
prematurely
aged
and
goats
trying
all
they
are
worth
to
extract
sustenance
from
the
red
shaly
earth
and
its
sparse
growth
of
coarse
herbage
looking
out
on
this
horrible
desert
the
eye
and
the
mind
alike
grow
weary
and
the
latter
starts
speculating
in
a
shuddering
sort
of
a
way
as
to
how
the
deuce
anything
human
can
find
it
in
its
heart
to
exist
in
such
a
place
yet
though
an
awful
desert
in
time
of
drought
it
is
not
always
so
but
gazing
forth
upon
the
surrounding
waste
laurence
was
able
to
read
into
it
a
certain
charm
the
charm
of
freedom
of
boundlessness
so
vividly
standing
out
in
contrast
to
his
own
cramped
narrow
life
all
the
changed
conditions
the
wildness
the
solitude
the
flaming
and
unclouded
sun
were
as
a
new
awakening
to
life
the
current
of
a
certain
joy
of
living
long
since
sluggish
congealed
now
coursed
swiftly
and
without
hinderance
through
his
being
now
through
all
those
hours
of
tedious
travelling
in
the
flaming
glow
of
day
or
in
the
still
cool
watches
of
the
night
he
had
with
him
a
recollection
lilith
ormskirk
face
haunted
him
those
eyes
seemed
to
follow
him
sweet
serious
or
again
mirthful
flashing
from
out
their
dark
fringe
of
lashes
but
ever
entrancing
ever
inviting
her
whole
personality
in
fact
seemed
to
pervade
his
mind
warring
for
sole
possession
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
thought
all
other
consideration
into
the
conflict
his
own
mind
entered
with
a
zest
it
was
a
psychological
struggle
which
appealed
to
him
and
that
thoroughly
she
should
not
by
her
witchery
take
entire
possession
yet
the
recollection
of
her
was
so
potent
that
at
length
he
ceased
to
strive
against
it
he
gave
way
abandoned
himself
contentedly
voluptuously
to
its
sway
even
aiding
it
in
the
pictures
it
conjured
up
now
he
saw
her
as
he
had
first
passed
her
day
after
day
on
board
ship
with
indifference
with
faintly
ironical
curiosity
again
as
when
they
had
first
begun
to
talk
together
and
yet
again
when
he
had
found
himself
resorting
to
all
manner
of
cowardly
mental
expedients
to
persuade
himself
that
he
did
not
revel
in
her
dangerously
winning
attractiveness
and
sweet
sympathetic
converse
in
the
monotonous
time
beat
of
the
wheels
he
could
conjure
up
her
voice
even
the
colonial
trick
of
clipping
the
final
r
in
words
ending
with
that
letter
as
to
which
he
had
often
rallied
her
while
secretly
liking
it
for
this
like
a
touch
of
the
brogue
can
be
winsome
enough
when
uttered
by
pretty
lips
now
all
these
reflections
could
not
but
be
profitless
possibly
dangerous
yet
they
had
this
advantage
they
helped
to
kill
time
and
that
during
a
journey
across
the
karroo
well
it
is
an
advantage
on
through
the
long
hot
day
and
still
that
memory
was
with
him
the
solitude
the
stillness
the
mile
after
mile
over
the
desolate
and
barren
waste
the
novelty
of
the
scene
the
monotonous
rattle
of
the
wheels
all
went
to
perpetuate
it
then
the
sun
drew
down
to
the
horizon
and
the
departing
glow
striking
upon
the
red
soil
painted
the
latter
the
colour
of
blood
making
up
an
extraordinarily
vivid
study
in
red
and
blue
overhead
a
cloudless
sky
the
horizon
all
aflame
and
the
whole
earth
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
steeped
in
the
richest
purple
red
laurence
fell
fast
asleep
he
dreamed
they
were
steaming
into
charing
cross
station
lilith
was
waiting
to
meet
him
he
swore
in
his
dream
because
they
had
halted
on
the
railway
bridge
too
long
to
take
the
tickets
then
he
awoke
they
were
steaming
slowly
into
a
terminus
amid
the
familiar
flashing
of
lamps
and
the
rumbling
of
porters
trucks
but
it
was
not
charing
cross
it
was
kimberley
not
long
did
it
take
him
to
collect
his
scanty
baggage
and
fling
it
into
a
cab
otherwise
an
open
cape
cart
hardly
had
he
taken
his
seat
than
the
driver
uttered
a
and
with
a
jerk
that
nearly
sent
its
passenger
somersaulting
into
the
road
the
concern
started
off
as
hard
as
its
eight
legs
and
two
wheels
could
carry
it
the
night
was
dark
the
streets
guiltless
of
lighting
as
the
trap
zigzagged
furiously
from
one
side
of
the
way
to
the
other
now
poised
on
one
wheel
now
leaping
bodily
into
the
air
as
it
charged
through
a
deep
hole
or
rut
it
was
a
comfort
to
the
said
passenger
to
reflect
that
the
road
being
feet
deep
in
sand
one
was
bound
to
fall
soft
anyhow
yet
candidly
he
rather
enjoyed
it
after
hours
in
a
south
african
flying
watkin
even
this
spurious
excitement
was
welcome
they
shaved
corners
always
on
one
wheel
sometimes
even
scraping
the
corners
of
houses
and
causing
those
pedestrians
in
their
line
of
flight
to
skip
like
young
unicorns
then
recovering
the
startled
wayfarers
would
hurl
their
choicest
blessings
after
the
cab
to
these
the
madcap
driver
would
reply
with
a
shrill
and
fiendish
yell
belabouring
his
frantic
cattle
with
a
view
to
attempting
fresh
feats
they
succeeded
it
only
wanted
a
coming
down
the
street
to
afford
them
the
opportunity
the
came
then
a
dead
dull
scrunch
an
awful
shock
and
the
cab
was
at
a
standstill
the
waggon
people
opened
their
and
let
off
a
fearful
blast
of
profanity
the
replied
in
suitable
and
feeling
terms
then
backed
clear
of
the
wreck
and
whipped
on
vastly
amused
by
this
lively
experience
laurence
still
ventured
to
expostulate
mildly
and
as
a
matter
of
form
but
he
got
no
more
change
out
of
his
present
jehu
than
horace
greeley
did
of
hank
monk
the
reply
accompanied
by
a
jovial
guffaw
was
all
right
mister
you
sit
tight
and
i
fetch
you
through
which
hotel
did
you
say
laurence
refreshed
his
memory
and
swaying
jerking
pounding
into
ruts
and
holes
the
chariot
drew
up
like
a
hurricane
blast
before
quite
an
building
at
the
corner
of
the
market
square
having
paid
off
the
lunatic
of
the
whip
and
stood
him
a
drink
laurence
engaged
a
room
and
wondered
what
the
deuce
he
should
do
with
himself
if
delayed
here
any
time
for
the
glimpse
he
had
obtained
of
the
place
seemed
not
inviting
the
same
crowded
bars
the
same
roaring
racket
the
same
dust
yea
even
the
same
thirst
he
had
seen
it
all
before
in
other
parts
of
the
world
he
was
destined
to
wonder
still
more
and
wearily
what
he
should
do
with
himself
for
nearly
a
week
went
by
before
he
could
secure
a
seat
in
the
coach
a
great
depression
came
upon
him
begotten
of
the
heat
and
the
drowsiness
and
the
dust
as
day
after
day
seemed
to
bring
with
it
no
emancipation
from
the
town
dumped
down
on
its
surrounding
flat
and
desert
waste
yet
nothing
akin
to
homesickness
was
there
in
his
depression
he
wanted
to
get
onward
not
to
return
he
was
bored
and
in
the
blues
yet
as
he
looked
back
the
feeling
which
predominated
was
that
of
freedom
of
having
a
certain
measure
of
life
and
its
prospects
before
him
stay
though
his
thoughts
would
at
times
travel
backward
and
that
in
spite
of
himself
and
they
would
land
him
with
a
lingering
though
unacknowledged
regretfulness
on
the
deck
of
the
well
that
was
only
an
episode
it
had
passed
away
out
of
his
life
and
it
was
as
well
that
it
had
but
had
it
at
last
to
our
wayfarer
unspeakable
joy
deliverance
came
it
had
been
laurence
lot
to
travel
in
far
worse
conveyances
than
the
regular
coaches
which
at
that
time
performed
the
journey
between
kimberley
and
johannesburg
a
distance
of
close
upon
three
hundred
miles
consequently
although
not
among
the
fortunate
ones
who
had
secured
a
corner
seat
he
managed
to
make
himself
as
comfortable
as
any
traveller
in
comparatively
outlandish
regions
has
a
right
to
expect
his
consisted
for
the
most
part
of
mechanics
of
the
better
sort
and
a
loquacious
jew
not
at
all
a
bad
sort
of
fellow
in
conversation
with
whom
he
would
now
and
then
beguile
the
weariness
of
the
route
and
it
was
weary
the
flat
sameness
of
the
treeless
plains
as
mile
after
mile
brought
no
change
the
same
stony
kopjes
the
same
deserted
and
mining
structures
the
same
dutch
homesteads
whose
owners
had
apparently
taken
on
the
hopelessness
of
their
surroundings
the
same
miserable
wayside
inns
where
leathery
and
bones
and
rice
painted
yellow
were
dispensed
under
the
title
of
breakfast
and
dinner
what
time
the
coach
halted
to
change
horses
and
even
then
only
served
up
when
the
driver
was
frantically
vociferating
all
aboard
thus
they
journeyed
day
and
night
allowing
perhaps
three
hours
or
four
at
the
outside
for
sleep
on
a
bed
but
the
latter
proved
an
institution
of
dubious
beneficence
because
of
its
far
from
dubious
animation
the
said
animation
scorning
blithely
and
imperviously
accumulations
of
insect
powder
reaching
back
into
the
dim
past
left
there
and
added
to
by
a
countless
procession
of
tortured
travellers
howbeit
of
these
and
like
discomforts
are
such
journeyings
productive
wherefore
they
are
scarcely
to
be
reckoned
as
worthy
of
note
chapter
king
scrip
hallo
stanninghame
and
so
here
you
are
here
i
am
rainsford
as
you
say
and
from
what
i
have
heard
in
process
of
getting
here
i
afraid
i
have
got
here
a
day
too
late
the
other
laughed
as
they
shook
hands
he
was
a
man
of
laurence
own
age
straight
and
active
and
his
bronzed
face
wore
that
alert
eager
look
which
was
noticeable
upon
the
faces
of
most
of
the
for
of
such
was
the
bulk
of
the
inhabitants
of
johannesburg
at
that
time
you
never
can
tell
he
rejoined
things
are
a
bit
slack
now
because
of
this
infernal
drought
but
a
good
sousing
rain
or
a
few
smart
thunder
showers
would
fill
all
the
dams
and
set
the
batteries
working
again
harder
than
ever
it
the
rainy
time
of
year
too
it
was
the
morning
after
laurence
arrival
in
johannesburg
and
while
sallying
forth
to
find
rainsford
the
two
had
met
on
commissioner
street
the
looked
anything
but
what
it
was
it
did
not
look
new
in
spite
of
the
general
unfinishedness
of
the
streets
and
sidewalks
the
latter
largely
conspicuous
by
their
absence
in
spite
of
the
predominance
of
scaffolding
poles
and
structures
of
red
brick
in
spite
of
the
countless
tenements
of
corrugated
iron
and
the
tall
chimneys
of
mining
works
which
came
in
here
where
steeples
would
have
arisen
in
an
ordinary
town
in
spite
of
all
this
there
was
a
battered
and
aspect
about
the
place
which
made
it
look
centuries
old
great
pillars
of
dust
towered
skywards
then
dispersing
whirled
in
mighty
wreaths
over
the
shining
iron
roofs
to
fall
hissing
back
into
the
streets
whence
they
arose
choking
with
pungent
particles
the
throats
eyes
and
ears
of
the
eager
busy
speculative
acquisitive
crowd
who
had
flocked
hither
like
wasps
to
a
jar
of
beer
and
honey
and
to
many
indeed
it
was
destined
to
prove
just
such
a
trap
well
what
do
you
advise
rainsford
said
laurence
after
some
more
talk
about
the
rand
and
its
prospects
wait
a
day
or
two
you
do
want
to
buy
in
a
falling
market
there
are
several
good
companies
to
put
into
but
things
have
touched
bottom
yet
when
they
do
and
just
begin
to
rise
then
buy
in
meanwhile
lie
low
you
speak
like
a
book
rainsford
said
one
of
two
men
who
joined
them
at
that
moment
there
a
capital
company
now
whose
shares
are
on
the
rise
again
could
do
better
than
take
two
or
three
hundred
of
them
what
do
you
say
name
i
watch
it
said
rainsford
with
an
emphatic
and
negative
shake
of
the
head
i
say
you
do
want
a
couple
of
building
stands
they
treble
their
value
in
as
many
weeks
going
cheap
as
dirt
now
not
taking
any
rankin
was
the
uncompromising
reply
for
rainsford
knew
something
about
those
building
stands
you
making
a
mistake
bless
my
soul
if
only
i
had
the
money
to
spare
i
take
them
at
double
myself
i
only
agent
in
the
matter
though
i
ca
do
any
business
at
all
with
you
fellows
this
morning
all
this
was
said
in
the
most
genial
and
tone
imaginable
the
speaker
was
a
spare
straight
neatly
dressed
individual
of
middle
age
his
face
was
of
a
dark
bronze
hue
lit
up
by
a
pair
of
keen
black
eyes
and
his
beard
was
prematurely
gray
almost
white
the
expression
of
keenness
on
a
deal
was
not
characteristic
of
him
alone
everyone
wore
it
in
those
days
that
was
a
great
old
shot
you
did
on
me
rainsford
with
those
verneuk
draais
cut
in
the
other
man
in
a
jolly
sort
of
voice
he
was
a
tall
athletic
fellow
whose
condition
looked
as
hard
as
nails
it
just
was
well
i
buy
them
back
if
you
like
wheeler
how
much
sixteen
and
a
half
a
roar
of
derision
went
up
from
the
other
sixteen
and
a
half
and
i
took
them
over
from
you
at
sixteen
and
a
half
well
are
you
taking
said
rainsford
dead
off
returned
the
other
what
do
you
say
you
fellows
cut
in
the
first
who
had
spoken
a
little
of
something
before
lunch
wo
do
us
any
harm
eh
what
do
you
say
that
so
come
along
sung
out
the
tall
man
spinning
round
upon
one
heel
and
heading
for
the
exchange
bar
there
nothing
like
an
angostura
to
give
one
an
appetite
said
the
dark
man
to
laurence
as
they
walked
along
it
gives
tone
to
the
system
angostura
with
a
little
drop
of
gin
in
it
with
a
little
drop
of
gin
in
it
repeated
wheeler
with
a
derisive
roar
that
where
the
tone
to
the
system
comes
in
eh
rankin
only
just
out
from
home
are
you
said
the
latter
to
laurence
as
having
named
their
respective
poisons
the
original
four
with
two
or
three
others
who
had
joined
them
stood
absorbing
the
same
heavens
did
you
ever
hear
such
a
row
in
your
life
he
went
on
as
through
the
open
door
connecting
with
the
exchange
came
the
frantic
bawling
of
brokers
competing
wildly
for
blazesfonteins
and
verneuk
laagtes
and
hellpoorts
and
vulture
vleis
and
madeiras
and
marshes
and
up
and
down
the
whole
gamut
and
there
in
the
crowd
lining
the
bar
and
in
the
crowd
outside
the
exchange
and
in
the
crowd
upon
market
square
where
the
auctioneers
stood
elbow
to
elbow
bellowing
from
their
tubs
and
where
you
might
bid
for
anything
from
a
building
stand
or
a
pair
of
horses
to
a
concertina
or
a
pair
of
stays
everywhere
the
talk
was
the
same
and
it
was
of
scrip
king
scrip
ruled
the
roost
just
then
however
the
subjects
of
king
scrip
were
undergoing
rather
an
anxious
time
for
the
drought
was
becoming
serious
dams
being
empty
batteries
could
not
work
result
scrip
drawing
within
alarming
distance
of
touching
its
own
value
paper
to
wit
and
as
the
dams
became
more
empty
those
with
an
n
appended
became
more
and
more
full
yea
exceeding
and
both
loud
and
deep
in
the
churches
they
were
praying
for
rain
praying
hard
for
rain
meant
money
and
in
the
bars
they
were
cussing
for
lack
of
it
cussing
hard
on
the
same
principle
then
the
rain
came
and
in
the
churches
they
sang
te
deum
and
in
the
bars
they
drove
a
humming
trade
in
champagne
where
john
walker
had
been
good
enough
before
up
went
scrip
and
laurence
stanninghame
having
judiciously
invested
his
little
all
cleared
about
three
hundred
pounds
in
as
many
days
things
began
to
look
rosy
by
this
time
too
laurence
got
sick
of
hanging
around
the
exchange
and
talking
scrip
he
had
no
turn
that
way
wherefore
now
he
was
glad
enough
to
leave
his
affairs
in
the
hands
of
rainsford
who
being
an
inhabitant
of
johannesburg
was
of
course
a
broker
and
having
picked
up
a
very
decent
no
bore
on
one
of
the
sales
aforesaid
laid
himself
out
to
see
what
sport
was
obtainable
in
the
surrounding
country
this
was
not
much
but
it
involved
many
a
hard
and
long
tramp
and
the
transvaal
atmosphere
is
brisk
and
exhilarating
with
the
result
that
eye
and
brain
grew
clearer
and
his
condition
became
as
hard
as
nails
and
as
there
is
nothing
like
a
thoroughly
healthy
condition
of
body
combined
with
an
equally
healthy
mental
state
in
this
instance
the
elation
produced
by
an
intensely
measure
of
success
laurence
began
to
realize
a
certain
pleasure
in
living
a
sensation
to
which
he
had
been
a
stranger
for
many
a
long
year
and
which
assuredly
he
had
never
expected
to
experience
again
for
the
market
still
continued
to
hum
and
by
dint
of
judicious
investments
and
quick
turnings
over
laurence
had
more
than
doubled
the
original
amount
he
had
put
in
at
this
rate
the
moderate
wealth
to
which
he
aspired
would
soon
be
his
and
now
with
the
ball
of
success
apparently
at
his
feet
so
unsatisfying
so
ironical
are
the
conditions
of
life
that
he
was
conscious
of
a
something
to
damp
the
anticipatory
delights
of
that
success
those
long
solitary
tramps
over
the
veldt
after
scant
coveys
of
partridge
or
the
stealthy
stalk
of
wild
duck
at
some
were
very
conducive
to
introspection
that
wealth
which
he
imagined
within
his
grasp
did
not
now
look
so
sufficing
and
yet
he
had
deemed
it
the
end
and
of
life
even
with
his
past
experience
the
depressing
deteriorating
effects
mental
and
physical
of
years
of
poverty
in
its
most
squalid
and
depressing
form
poverty
he
realized
that
even
the
possession
of
wealth
might
leave
something
to
be
desired
in
fact
he
became
conscious
of
an
unsatisfied
longing
by
no
means
vague
but
very
real
which
came
to
him
at
his
time
of
life
with
a
sort
of
dismayed
surprise
he
would
give
up
these
solitary
wanderings
in
search
of
sport
the
sport
was
of
a
poor
description
and
the
intervals
between
were
too
long
he
had
too
much
time
to
think
he
would
knock
around
the
town
a
little
for
a
change
and
talk
to
fellows
one
morning
he
was
walking
down
the
street
with
rainsford
and
wheeler
the
latter
who
was
an
hunter
busy
in
pursuance
of
the
prevailing
spirit
in
trying
to
trade
him
sundry
pairs
of
big
game
horns
and
other
trophies
when
he
heard
his
name
called
in
a
very
well
remembered
voice
turning
he
beheld
holmes
stanninghame
old
chap
i
glad
to
run
against
you
again
cried
the
latter
advancing
upon
him
with
outstretched
hand
i
begin
to
believe
you
are
answered
laurence
genially
with
a
comical
glance
at
the
other
beaming
countenance
why
you
actually
have
a
look
that
way
when
did
you
get
here
by
last
night
coach
and
i
say
trying
to
look
wondrously
mysterious
and
knowing
who
do
you
think
travelled
up
by
it
too
i
ca
even
venture
the
feeblest
guess
ca
you
chuckled
holmes
what
about
miss
ormskirk
eh
that
so
now
i
remember
she
did
say
something
about
a
possibility
of
coming
up
here
before
long
replied
laurence
equably
while
conscious
that
the
announcement
had
convulsed
his
inner
being
with
a
strange
sweet
thrill
for
it
came
so
aptly
upon
his
meditations
of
late
the
one
unsatisfied
longing
her
presence
and
now
even
that
was
to
be
fulfilled
you
do
seem
to
take
it
over
enthusiastically
stanninghame
went
on
holmes
and
you
and
she
were
rather
thick
towards
the
end
of
the
voyage
he
added
mischievously
did
you
ever
know
me
enthuse
about
anything
holmes
but
it
about
lunch
time
let
go
and
get
some
and
you
can
tell
me
what
you
have
been
doing
since
we
landed
from
the
old
and
what
the
deuce
has
brought
you
up
here
this
was
all
very
friendly
and
plausible
but
before
they
had
been
seated
many
minutes
at
lunch
in
a
conveniently
adjacent
restaurant
holmes
was
discoursing
singularly
little
upon
his
doings
spread
over
the
weeks
which
had
elapsed
since
he
had
landed
but
most
volubly
upon
his
recent
coach
journey
congested
within
a
space
of
three
days
to
which
topic
he
was
tactfully
moved
by
his
audience
of
one
and
also
by
his
own
inclination
as
will
hereinafter
appear
was
miss
ormskirk
travelling
alone
did
you
say
holmes
queried
laurence
in
initiation
of
his
deft
scheme
for
drawing
the
other
not
much
there
was
a
big
johnny
with
her
he
scowled
at
me
like
sin
when
we
were
introduced
was
inclined
to
be
beastly
rude
in
fact
until
he
saw
that
i
er
that
i
talked
most
to
the
other
then
he
got
quite
affable
to
the
other
what
other
out
with
it
holmes
said
laurence
with
a
half
smile
at
his
friend
thinly
veiled
embarrassment
oh
there
was
another
girl
in
the
crowd
miss
falkner
deuced
pretty
girl
too
the
sulky
chappie
was
her
brother
whose
brother
miss
ormskirk
said
laurence
innocently
no
the
one
at
least
they
both
called
him
george
yes
i
remember
they
came
on
board
the
you
had
landed
already
i
think
from
your
description
i
recognize
them
so
they
are
up
here
where
are
they
staying
at
that
outlying
place
where
the
coach
first
begins
to
get
among
houses
i
ca
remember
the
name
there
a
biggish
pub
you
know
and
a
lot
of
houses
booyseus
that
was
it
booyseus
they
asked
me
to
go
and
see
them
you
better
come
along
too
stanninghame
i
say
think
it
be
too
soon
if
we
went
eh
sort
of
excuse
to
ask
if
they
recovered
from
the
journey
eh
was
george
so
very
exhausted
then
oh
hang
your
chaff
stanninghame
what
do
you
think
you
an
older
chap
than
i
am
and
know
more
about
these
things
would
it
be
too
soon
if
we
went
be
comforted
holmes
as
far
as
it
rests
with
me
you
shall
behold
your
charmer
if
she
at
home
the
conversation
worked
round
to
the
inevitable
topic
king
scrip
holmes
was
fired
with
eagerness
when
in
his
unenthusiastic
way
the
other
began
to
tell
of
such
successes
as
he
had
already
scored
for
he
too
had
come
up
there
to
take
advantage
of
the
boom
he
was
eager
to
rush
out
there
and
then
to
buy
shares
nothing
would
satisfy
him
but
that
laurence
must
take
him
round
and
introduce
him
to
rainsford
on
the
spot
but
on
the
way
to
that
worthy
office
something
happened
turning
into
commissioner
street
they
ran
right
into
a
party
of
four
result
exclamations
of
astonishment
of
recognition
greetings
from
both
sides
three
of
the
quartette
we
have
already
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
fourth
falkner
a
lady
was
the
aunt
of
the
other
three
and
with
her
they
were
staying
i
heard
of
you
stanninghame
said
this
one
when
introductions
had
been
effected
i
hope
you
have
made
a
success
of
johannesburg
so
far
everybody
turns
up
here
i
can
hardly
come
up
to
the
camp
we
used
to
call
it
that
in
the
old
days
i
was
among
the
first
up
here
you
know
and
it
difficult
to
get
into
the
way
of
calling
it
the
town
i
can
hardly
come
up
here
i
was
saying
without
meeting
some
one
or
other
i
had
known
elsewhere
yes
it
an
astonishing
place
falkner
answered
laurence
only
bare
veldt
but
a
very
few
years
ago
now
a
population
of
forty
thousand
mostly
brokers
she
laughed
and
lilith
cut
in
i
thought
you
were
going
to
adopt
the
carlylean
definition
of
the
people
of
england
mr
stanninghame
oh
that
come
in
time
i
only
trust
i
may
not
hold
on
too
long
to
come
under
its
lash
let
us
hope
none
of
us
will
said
falkner
oh
dear
we
are
all
dreadfully
reckless
i
fear
we
are
nothing
but
gamblers
up
here
have
you
caught
the
contagion
too
mr
stanninghame
i
afraid
so
he
answered
thinking
how
even
among
the
softer
sex
here
king
scrip
bore
the
principal
sway
he
was
thinking
of
something
else
at
the
same
time
lilith
was
looking
even
more
sweet
more
bewitchingly
attractive
than
when
last
he
had
seen
her
there
was
a
warm
seductive
glow
of
health
in
her
dark
brilliant
beauty
a
winsomeness
in
her
simple
tasteful
attire
the
cool
blouse
and
skirt
in
a
soft
harmony
of
cream
colour
and
light
gray
and
the
plain
straw
hat
of
the
sailor
kind
which
made
to
his
eyes
an
irresistibly
entrancing
picture
she
no
less
than
himself
was
comparing
notes
as
two
people
will
who
have
been
apart
for
a
space
and
have
thought
much
of
each
other
in
the
interim
he
too
was
improved
in
appearance
the
fine
climate
the
life
had
lent
a
deeper
bronze
to
his
face
and
a
clearness
to
his
eyes
even
as
an
emancipation
from
sordid
cares
together
with
a
present
modicum
of
success
and
a
prospect
of
further
in
the
future
had
imparted
a
certain
stamp
of
serenity
to
his
expression
which
was
not
there
before
air
freedom
life
healthier
side
are
good
success
is
good
all
good
things
are
good
behold
their
result
was
lilith
inner
verdict
as
the
summing
up
of
this
inspection
now
george
falkner
efforts
at
cordiality
were
about
as
effective
as
the
demeanour
of
a
crusty
mastiff
encountering
another
of
his
kind
well
within
sweep
of
his
owner
lash
his
jealous
soul
had
noted
the
glance
exchanged
between
his
cousin
and
laurence
stanninghame
the
responsive
glance
which
for
a
brief
second
would
not
be
disguised
the
great
and
gladness
which
shone
in
both
pairs
of
eyes
as
a
result
of
this
meeting
he
stood
gloomy
and
grim
while
the
two
were
talking
together
and
then
rather
brusquely
and
to
the
disgust
of
holmes
who
was
discoursing
eagerly
with
pretty
mabel
falkner
he
reminded
his
aunt
that
they
were
due
to
call
at
and
were
far
behind
their
time
ah
yes
i
was
forgetting
well
stanninghame
i
hope
you
will
come
and
see
us
it
is
nothing
of
a
walk
out
to
booyseus
and
besides
there
are
several
omnibuses
in
the
course
of
the
day
mind
you
come
too
holmes
and
the
four
resumed
their
way
and
so
did
our
two
jolly
genial
old
party
that
falkner
pronounced
holmes
half
turning
slyly
to
sneak
a
last
glance
after
the
and
receding
mabel
spare
my
susceptibilities
holmes
even
in
your
exuberance
that
party
as
you
so
unfeelingly
define
her
can
not
own
to
more
than
two
or
three
years
seniority
over
my
respectable
self
four
at
the
outside
said
laurence
maliciously
oh
go
along
with
you
old
chap
retorted
holmes
yet
conscious
of
feeling
just
a
trifle
foolish
but
i
say
eagerly
can
we
still
go
and
look
them
up
so
soon
as
eh
do
let
that
misgiving
interfere
with
your
beauty
sleep
holmes
was
the
reply
dashed
with
a
touch
of
impatience
people
are
not
so
beastly
ceremonious
over
here
i
brought
you
another
sheep
to
shear
rainsford
said
laurence
as
they
entered
the
broker
office
do
clip
him
any
closer
than
you
did
me
though
he
dying
to
set
up
as
a
millionaire
on
the
spot
and
then
having
effected
this
introduction
he
left
the
pair
to
do
business
or
not
as
the
case
might
be
and
strolled
back
to
his
own
quarters
what
was
this
marvellous
metamorphosis
which
had
come
upon
him
flooding
his
life
with
golden
waves
of
sweetness
and
of
light
now
that
he
had
beheld
lilith
once
more
he
realized
what
entire
hold
she
had
taken
of
his
thoughts
since
they
two
had
parted
on
the
deck
of
the
it
was
a
certainty
there
was
no
getting
away
from
but
a
certainty
now
which
he
was
not
in
the
least
desirous
of
getting
away
from
he
had
beheld
her
once
more
their
meeting
had
been
of
the
briefest
their
interchange
of
remarks
of
the
most
commonplace
nature
yet
he
had
beheld
her
had
listened
to
the
sound
of
her
voice
had
looked
into
her
eyes
and
the
glance
of
those
sweet
eyes
had
been
responsive
and
his
ear
could
detect
a
subtile
note
in
the
tones
of
her
voice
sweet
lilith
the
spells
she
had
begun
to
wreathe
around
him
so
unconsciously
to
herself
so
unconsciously
to
him
when
first
they
talked
together
were
drawn
woven
more
thoroughly
now
and
in
his
strange
new
revivification
the
return
of
strength
and
health
and
spirits
he
rejoiced
that
it
was
so
and
laughed
and
defied
circumstances
and
fate
and
the
future
chapter
vi
pirate
hazon
if
the
population
of
johannesburg
devoted
its
days
to
doing
to
king
scrip
it
devoted
its
nights
to
amusing
itself
there
was
an
enterprising
theatrical
company
and
a
lively
circus
there
was
a
menagerie
where
an
exceedingly
fine
young
woman
was
wont
nightly
to
place
her
head
within
a
lion
mouth
for
the
delectation
and
to
the
enthusiastic
admiration
of
judæa
and
all
the
region
round
about
there
were
galore
more
or
less
good
of
their
kind
and
failing
sporadic
forms
of
pastime
there
were
numerous
bars
and
barmaids
all
of
which
counted
for
something
in
the
relaxation
of
the
forty
thousand
inhabitants
of
johannesburg
mostly
brokers
we
are
forgetting
there
were
other
phases
of
nocturnal
excitement
more
or
less
of
a
stimulating
nature
frequent
rows
to
wit
culminating
in
a
nasty
and
now
and
then
a
startling
and
barbarous
murder
now
to
laurence
stanninghame
not
any
of
the
above
forms
of
diversion
held
out
the
slightest
possible
attractiveness
the
theatrical
show
struck
him
as
and
as
for
circuses
and
menageries
he
supposed
they
had
been
good
fun
when
he
was
a
child
he
did
not
care
twopence
about
the
pleasures
of
the
bar
unless
he
wanted
a
drink
and
for
barmaids
and
their
allurements
less
than
nothing
so
having
already
with
rainsford
or
wheeler
and
seven
other
spirits
more
wicked
than
themselves
gone
the
round
three
or
four
times
just
to
see
what
there
was
to
be
seen
and
found
that
not
much
he
had
subsided
into
a
good
bit
of
a
a
pipe
a
newspaper
or
book
and
bed
would
be
his
evening
program
normally
that
is
for
now
and
then
he
would
stroll
out
to
booyseus
but
of
that
more
anon
the
hotel
at
which
he
had
taken
up
his
quarters
was
rather
a
quiet
one
and
frequented
by
quiet
people
one
set
of
rooms
among
which
was
his
opened
upon
a
which
fronted
a
yard
which
opened
upon
the
street
here
of
an
evening
he
would
drag
a
chair
out
upon
the
and
smoke
and
read
or
occasionally
chat
with
some
in
the
house
one
evening
he
was
seated
thus
alone
holmes
who
had
taken
up
his
quarters
at
the
same
hotel
was
out
as
usual
we
say
as
usual
because
holmes
seldom
stayed
in
at
night
holmes
was
young
and
for
him
the
attractions
we
have
striven
to
enumerate
above
and
others
which
we
have
not
were
attractions
he
liked
to
go
the
round
he
liked
to
see
all
there
was
to
be
seen
well
he
saw
it
one
evening
laurence
seated
thus
alone
became
aware
that
another
man
was
dragging
a
chair
out
upon
the
intending
like
himself
to
take
the
air
looking
up
he
saw
that
it
was
the
man
to
whom
nobody
ever
seemed
to
talk
beyond
exchanging
the
time
of
day
and
that
in
the
most
curt
and
perfunctory
fashion
he
had
noticed
further
that
this
individual
seemed
no
more
anxious
to
converse
with
other
people
than
they
were
to
converse
with
him
he
himself
had
never
got
beyond
this
stage
with
him
although
on
easy
and
friendly
terms
with
the
other
people
staying
in
the
house
yet
the
man
had
awakened
in
him
a
strange
interest
a
curiosity
that
was
almost
acute
but
beyond
the
fact
that
his
name
was
hazon
and
the
darkly
veiled
hints
on
the
part
of
those
who
alluded
to
the
subject
that
he
was
a
ruffian
of
the
deepest
dye
laurence
could
learn
nothing
about
him
he
noted
however
that
if
the
man
seemed
disliked
he
seemed
about
equally
feared
this
hazon
was
in
truth
somewhat
of
a
remarkable
individual
he
was
of
powerful
build
standing
about
five
feet
nine
he
had
a
strong
face
the
lower
part
hidden
in
a
dark
beard
and
his
eyes
were
black
piercing
and
rather
deep
set
the
bronze
hue
of
his
complexion
and
of
the
sinewy
hands
seemed
to
tell
of
a
life
of
hardness
and
adventure
and
the
square
jaw
and
straight
piercing
glance
was
that
of
a
man
who
when
roused
would
prove
a
resolute
relentless
and
a
most
dangerous
enemy
in
repose
the
face
wore
a
placidity
which
was
almost
that
of
melancholy
in
trying
to
estimate
his
years
laurence
owned
himself
puzzled
again
and
again
he
might
be
about
his
own
age
or
he
might
be
a
great
deal
older
that
is
anything
from
forty
to
sixty
but
whatever
his
age
whatever
his
past
the
man
was
always
the
same
dark
coldly
reticent
inscrutable
somewhat
of
an
personality
the
nature
of
his
business
too
was
no
more
open
than
was
his
past
history
he
had
been
some
months
in
his
present
quarters
yet
was
not
known
to
be
doing
anything
in
scrip
to
any
appreciable
extent
the
boom
the
one
engrossing
idea
in
the
minds
of
all
alike
seemed
to
hold
no
fascination
for
hazon
to
him
it
was
a
matter
of
absolutely
no
importance
what
the
deuce
then
was
he
there
for
his
impenetrable
reserve
his
and
striking
personality
his
rather
sinister
expression
had
earned
for
him
a
he
was
known
all
over
the
rand
as
pirate
hazon
or
more
commonly
the
pirate
because
declared
the
rand
he
looked
like
one
and
at
any
rate
ought
to
be
hanged
for
one
to
make
sure
nobody
however
cared
to
use
the
epithet
within
his
hearing
people
were
afraid
of
him
one
day
in
the
street
a
tough
swaggering
bully
fearless
in
the
consciousness
of
his
powers
as
a
boxer
lurched
up
against
him
deliberately
and
with
offensive
intent
those
who
witnessed
the
act
stood
by
for
the
phase
of
excitement
dearest
of
all
to
their
hearts
a
row
there
was
that
in
hazon
look
which
told
they
were
not
to
be
disappointed
english
manners
he
queried
in
cutting
contemptuous
tone
i
teach
you
some
rejoined
the
fellow
promptly
and
without
more
ado
he
dashed
out
a
terrific
which
the
other
just
escaped
receiving
full
in
the
eye
but
not
entirely
as
to
the
cheekbone
hazon
did
not
hit
back
but
what
followed
amazed
even
the
bystanders
it
was
like
the
spring
of
an
animal
of
a
leopard
or
a
combining
the
lightning
swiftness
of
the
one
with
the
grim
fell
ferocity
of
purpose
of
the
other
the
powerful
rowdy
was
lying
upon
his
back
in
the
red
dust
swinging
blows
into
empty
air
and
upon
him
in
crouch
pressing
him
to
the
earth
the
man
whom
he
had
so
wantonly
attacked
and
his
throat
was
compressed
in
those
brown
lean
muscular
fingers
as
in
a
claw
of
steel
it
was
horrible
his
eyes
were
starting
from
his
head
his
face
grew
blue
then
black
his
swollen
tongue
protruded
hideously
his
struggles
were
terrific
yet
powerful
of
frame
as
he
was
he
seemed
like
a
child
in
the
grasp
of
a
panther
a
shout
of
dismay
of
warning
broke
from
the
spectators
some
of
whom
sprang
forward
to
separate
the
pair
but
there
was
something
so
awful
in
the
expression
of
hazon
countenance
in
the
glare
of
the
eyes
in
the
brows
and
livid
horror
of
fiendish
wrath
that
even
they
stopped
short
it
was
as
they
said
afterwards
as
though
they
had
looked
into
the
blasting
countenance
of
a
devil
leave
go
they
cried
for
god
sake
leave
go
you
killing
the
man
he
be
dead
in
a
second
longer
hazon
relaxed
his
grasp
and
stood
upright
beyond
a
slight
heaving
of
the
chest
attendant
upon
his
exertion
he
seemed
as
cool
and
collected
as
though
nothing
had
happened
i
believe
you
right
he
said
turning
away
well
he
is
that
yet
the
attention
of
the
onlookers
was
concentrated
on
the
prostrate
bully
to
restore
whom
a
doctor
was
promptly
sent
for
from
the
most
likely
bar
for
it
was
midday
but
all
were
constrained
to
allow
that
the
fellow
had
only
got
what
he
deserved
which
consensus
of
opinion
may
or
may
not
have
been
due
to
the
fact
that
he
was
if
anything
a
trifle
more
unpopular
than
hazon
himself
now
among
those
who
had
witnessed
this
scene
from
first
to
last
was
laurence
stanninghame
not
among
those
who
would
have
interfered
oh
no
for
did
he
not
hold
it
a
primary
tenet
never
on
any
pretext
to
interfere
in
what
did
not
concern
him
nor
did
this
principle
in
those
days
involve
any
effort
to
keep
all
impulse
to
violate
it
being
long
since
dead
moreover
if
the
last
held
good
of
the
badly
damaged
bully
society
at
large
could
not
but
be
the
gainer
since
it
was
clear
that
he
was
a
fit
representative
of
a
class
which
is
utterly
destitute
of
any
redeeming
point
which
should
go
to
justify
its
unspeakably
vicious
useless
and
rather
dangerous
existence
this
incident
while
enhancing
the
respect
in
which
hazon
was
held
in
no
sense
tended
to
lessen
his
unpopularity
and
indeed
at
that
time
nobody
had
a
good
word
to
say
for
him
either
they
said
nothing
and
looked
the
more
or
they
said
a
word
that
was
not
good
oh
no
not
good
now
in
spite
of
all
such
ill
repute
possibly
by
reason
of
it
his
temperament
being
what
it
was
laurence
felt
drawn
towards
this
mysterious
personage
for
he
was
one
given
to
forming
his
own
judgment
instead
of
accepting
it
ready
made
from
dick
tom
and
harry
if
hazon
was
vindictive
why
so
was
he
if
unscrupulous
so
could
he
be
if
driven
to
it
he
resolved
to
find
an
opportunity
of
cultivating
the
man
and
if
he
could
not
find
one
he
would
make
it
now
he
saw
such
an
opportunity
what
do
you
think
of
this
rumor
that
the
revolution
in
brazil
is
going
to
knock
out
our
share
market
he
said
suddenly
looking
up
from
the
paper
he
was
reading
it
may
do
that
answered
hazon
this
year
boom
has
been
a
mere
sick
attempt
at
one
would
take
much
to
knock
out
what
little
there
is
of
it
laurence
felt
a
cold
qualm
there
had
been
an
ominous
drop
the
last
day
or
two
still
rainsford
and
one
or
two
others
had
recommended
him
to
hold
on
this
man
spoke
so
quietly
yet
withal
so
prophetically
what
if
he
in
his
inscrutable
way
were
more
than
ordinarily
in
the
know
queer
place
this
pursued
hazon
the
other
having
uttered
a
dubious
affirmative
taking
it
all
round
it
and
its
crowd
it
not
far
from
the
queerest
place
i
ever
seen
in
my
life
and
i
seen
some
queer
places
and
some
queerish
crowds
i
expect
you
have
by
the
way
i
suppose
you
done
a
good
deal
of
hunting
a
goodish
deal
are
you
fond
of
the
gun
i
notice
you
go
out
pretty
often
but
there
nothing
to
shoot
around
here
i
just
am
fond
of
it
replied
laurence
if
things
turn
out
all
right
i
shall
cut
in
with
some
fellow
for
an
trip
if
i
can
big
game
this
time
the
other
smiled
darkly
enigmatically
yes
that
real
real
he
said
try
some
of
this
handing
his
tobacco
bag
as
laurence
began
to
scratch
out
his
empty
pipe
unless
that
is
you
have
got
over
the
prejudice
against
the
best
tobacco
in
the
world
the
name
whereof
is
transvaal
thanks
no
i
have
no
prejudice
against
it
on
the
contrary
as
to
its
merits
i
am
disposed
to
agree
with
you
throughout
this
conversation
laurence
who
had
a
keen
ear
for
that
sort
of
thing
could
not
help
noticing
the
other
voice
it
was
a
pleasing
voice
a
cultured
voice
and
refined
withal
nor
could
his
fastidious
ear
detect
the
faintest
trace
of
provincialism
or
vulgarity
about
it
the
intonation
was
perfect
there
is
nothing
so
quick
to
betray
to
the
sensitive
ear
any
strain
of
plebeian
descent
as
the
voice
and
of
this
no
one
was
more
thoroughly
aware
than
laurence
stanninghame
this
man
he
decided
was
of
good
birth
the
ice
broken
they
talked
on
in
the
apparently
careless
but
in
reality
guarded
way
which
had
become
second
nature
to
both
of
them
more
than
one
strange
and
very
shady
anecdote
was
hazon
able
to
narrate
concerning
the
place
and
its
inhabitants
and
especially
concerning
certain
among
the
latter
who
ranked
high
for
morality
commercially
or
otherwise
there
were
actions
done
in
their
midst
every
day
he
declared
which
for
barefaced
and
unscrupulous
rascality
would
put
to
the
blush
other
actions
for
which
the
law
would
hang
a
man
without
mercy
all
other
men
applauding
but
with
this
difference
that
whereas
the
former
demanded
a
creeping
and
crawling
cowardliness
to
insure
success
the
latter
involved
iron
nerve
and
the
daily
shaking
hands
with
death
death
too
in
many
an
appalling
and
ghastly
form
all
of
which
was
dark
talking
as
far
as
laurence
was
concerned
though
the
day
was
to
come
when
its
meaning
should
stand
forth
as
clear
as
a
printed
page
even
now
however
he
was
not
absolutely
mystified
far
from
it
indeed
for
he
himself
was
a
hard
thinker
owning
an
and
busy
brain
he
could
put
half
a
dozen
meanings
to
any
one
or
other
of
his
companion
utterances
and
among
them
probably
the
right
one
and
as
they
talked
on
he
became
alive
to
something
almost
magnetic
a
sort
of
subtile
compelling
force
about
hazon
was
it
his
voice
or
manner
or
general
aspect
or
a
combination
of
all
three
he
could
not
tell
he
could
only
realize
that
it
existed
for
some
days
after
this
conversation
the
two
men
did
not
come
together
though
they
would
nod
the
time
of
day
to
each
other
as
before
and
laurence
who
had
other
considerations
upon
his
hands
monetary
and
agreeable
did
not
give
the
matter
a
thought
at
last
he
noticed
that
hazon
place
at
the
table
was
vacant
remembering
too
that
it
had
been
so
for
a
day
or
two
had
he
left
to
his
inquiries
on
that
head
he
obtained
scant
and
uncordial
response
hazon
was
ill
some
believed
while
others
charitably
opined
that
he
was
on
the
booze
whatever
it
was
no
one
cared
and
strongly
recommended
laurence
to
do
likewise
the
latter
we
have
shown
was
peculiarly
unsusceptible
to
public
opinion
which
if
it
influenced
him
at
all
did
so
in
the
very
opposite
direction
to
that
which
was
intended
accordingly
he
now
made
up
his
mind
to
ascertain
the
truth
for
himself
to
which
end
he
found
himself
speedily
knocking
at
the
door
of
hazon
room
the
while
marvelling
at
his
own
unwonted
perturbation
lest
his
overture
should
be
regarded
as
an
intrusion
heard
you
were
ill
he
said
shortly
having
entered
in
obedience
to
the
responsive
come
in
rough
luck
being
ill
in
a
place
like
this
or
indeed
in
any
place
for
that
matter
thought
i
see
if
anything
i
could
do
for
you
very
good
of
you
stanninghame
sit
down
there
on
that
box
it
lower
than
the
chair
and
therefore
more
comfortable
yes
i
feel
a
bit
knocked
out
a
touch
of
the
old
shivers
or
something
of
the
kind
it
a
thing
you
never
entirely
pull
round
from
once
you
had
it
i
be
all
right
though
in
a
day
or
two
the
speaker
was
lying
on
his
bed
clad
in
his
trousers
and
shirt
the
latter
open
from
the
throat
revealed
part
of
a
great
livid
scar
running
diagonally
across
the
swarthy
chest
and
representing
what
must
have
been
a
terrific
slash
two
other
scars
also
showed
on
the
muscular
forearm
between
elbow
and
wrist
what
was
it
to
laurence
whether
this
person
or
that
person
lived
or
died
why
nothing
yet
there
was
something
so
pathetic
so
helpless
in
the
aspect
of
the
man
lying
there
day
after
day
patient
solitary
uncomplaining
shunned
and
avoided
by
those
around
that
appealed
powerfully
to
his
feelings
heavens
was
he
turning
at
his
time
of
life
that
he
should
feel
so
unaccountably
stirred
by
the
bare
act
of
coming
to
visit
this
ailing
and
unbefriended
stranger
in
truth
there
was
nothing
about
the
latter
now
his
piercing
black
eyes
seemed
large
and
soft
the
expression
of
his
dark
face
was
one
of
weariful
helplessness
yet
of
schooled
patience
a
queer
thought
flashed
through
laurence
brain
was
it
in
hazon
power
to
produce
whatever
effect
he
chose
upon
the
minds
of
others
had
he
chosen
for
some
inscrutable
purpose
to
render
himself
shunned
and
feared
was
he
now
on
like
principle
adopting
the
surest
means
to
win
over
to
him
this
one
man
who
had
sought
him
out
on
his
lonely
and
if
so
to
what
end
it
was
more
than
a
passing
thought
nor
from
that
moment
onward
could
laurence
ever
get
it
entirely
out
of
his
mind
fill
your
pipe
stanninghame
said
hazon
breaking
into
this
train
of
thought
which
all
unconsciously
had
entailed
a
long
gap
of
silence
i
do
in
the
least
mind
smoke
although
i
ca
blow
off
a
cloud
myself
just
now
at
least
i
have
no
inclination
that
way
he
added
reaching
for
a
bottle
of
white
powder
which
stood
upon
a
box
by
the
bedside
and
mixing
himself
a
modicum
of
quinine
had
a
doctor
of
any
sort
hazon
what
good
would
that
do
except
to
the
doctor
i
know
what
the
matter
with
me
and
i
know
exactly
what
to
do
for
it
i
do
want
to
pay
another
fellow
a
couple
of
guineas
or
so
to
tell
me
not
but
what
doctors
have
their
uses
in
wounds
and
surgery
for
instance
but
curiously
like
an
animal
when
i
get
anything
the
matter
with
me
which
i
do
often
i
like
to
creep
away
and
lie
low
i
like
to
take
it
alone
well
i
built
rather
that
way
myself
hazon
i
wo
apologize
for
intruding
because
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
no
such
consideration
enters
into
the
matter
still
i
want
you
to
know
that
if
anything
i
can
do
for
you
you
have
only
to
say
so
thanks
you
are
not
quite
like
other
people
stanninghame
life
is
no
great
thing
is
it
that
everybody
should
stir
up
such
a
mighty
fuss
about
clearing
out
of
it
no
it
no
great
thing
assented
laurence
darkly
yet
it
might
be
made
so
how
that
with
wealth
with
wealth
you
can
do
anything
command
anything
buy
anything
they
say
that
wealth
wo
purchase
life
but
very
often
it
will
you
about
three
parts
right
it
will
for
instance
enable
a
man
to
lead
the
life
he
needs
in
order
to
preserve
his
physical
and
mental
vigour
at
its
highest
even
from
the
moralist
point
of
view
it
is
all
round
desirable
for
nothing
is
so
morally
deteriorating
as
a
life
of
narrow
and
cramped
pinching
when
all
one
best
years
are
spent
in
hungering
and
longing
for
what
one
will
never
again
attain
you
speak
like
a
book
hazon
said
laurence
not
wondering
that
the
other
should
have
sized
up
his
own
case
so
exhaustively
not
wondering
because
he
was
an
observer
of
human
nature
and
a
himself
then
bitterly
yet
that
entity
the
ponderous
moralist
would
contend
that
the
lack
of
all
that
made
life
worth
living
was
good
as
a
stimulus
to
urge
to
exertion
and
all
the
hollow
old
quite
so
but
how
many
attain
to
the
reward
the
end
of
the
said
exertion
not
one
in
a
hundred
and
then
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
how
does
that
one
do
it
by
fraud
and
thieving
and
and
sycophancy
in
short
by
running
through
the
whole
gamut
of
the
scale
of
rascality
rascality
of
the
meaner
kind
mark
you
then
when
this
winner
in
the
battle
of
life
comes
out
top
the
world
crowns
him
with
fat
and
fulsome
eulogy
and
falls
down
and
worships
his
crying
a
man
go
thou
and
do
likewise
you
not
merely
hit
the
right
nail
on
the
head
hazon
but
driven
it
right
home
said
laurence
decisively
recognizing
that
here
was
a
man
after
his
own
heart
two
or
three
days
went
by
before
hazon
felt
able
or
inclined
to
leave
his
bed
and
a
good
part
of
each
was
spent
by
laurence
sitting
in
the
sick
man
room
and
talking
and
it
may
have
been
that
the
lonely
man
felt
cheered
by
the
companionship
and
the
friendliness
that
proffered
it
what
time
all
others
held
aloof
or
that
the
two
were
akin
in
ideas
or
both
but
henceforward
a
sort
of
intimacy
struck
up
between
them
and
it
was
noticed
that
hazon
no
longer
went
about
invariably
alone
then
people
began
to
look
somewhat
queerly
at
laurence
you
and
pirate
have
become
quite
thick
together
stanninghame
said
rainsford
one
day
meeting
him
alone
well
why
not
answered
laurence
rather
shortly
resenting
the
inquisitional
nature
of
the
question
then
point
blank
see
here
rainsford
why
are
you
all
so
down
on
the
man
what
has
he
done
anyway
you
need
get
your
shirt
out
old
chap
was
the
answer
quite
look
here
now
we
are
alone
together
so
just
between
ourselves
do
you
notice
how
all
of
these
going
fellows
shunt
him
wheeler
for
instance
and
garway
who
is
at
your
hotel
never
speaks
to
him
and
garway
you
admit
is
as
good
a
fellow
as
ever
lived
yes
i
own
up
to
that
what
then
only
this
that
they
know
a
good
deal
that
we
do
well
what
do
they
know
or
say
they
know
look
here
stanninghame
said
rainsford
rather
mysteriously
has
hazon
ever
told
you
any
of
his
experiences
a
few
yes
did
he
ever
suggest
you
should
take
a
trip
with
him
we
have
even
discussed
that
possibility
ah
then
rainsford
gave
a
long
whistle
and
his
voice
became
impressive
as
he
resumed
watch
it
stanninghame
from
time
to
time
other
men
have
gone
up
country
with
hazon
but
one
of
them
has
ever
oh
that
what
you
all
down
on
him
about
is
it
the
other
nodded
then
with
a
he
cut
across
the
street
and
disappeared
into
an
office
where
he
had
business
chapter
vii
the
whole
soul
prisoner
no
more
foolish
passion
was
ever
implanted
in
the
human
breast
than
that
of
jealousy
unless
it
were
that
of
which
it
is
the
direct
outcome
nor
is
there
any
which
the
average
human
is
less
potent
to
resist
the
victim
of
either
or
both
is
for
the
time
being
outside
reason
now
the
form
of
disease
is
to
the
philosophical
mind
of
all
others
the
most
essentially
foolish
indeed
we
can
hardly
call
to
mind
any
other
so
thoroughly
calculated
to
turn
the
average
man
or
woman
into
an
exuberantly
incurable
idiot
for
what
does
it
amount
to
when
we
come
to
pan
it
out
if
there
exist
grounds
for
the
misgiving
why
then
it
is
going
begging
grovelling
for
something
which
the
other
party
has
not
got
to
give
if
groundless
is
it
not
a
fulfilling
of
the
homely
old
saw
relating
to
cutting
off
nose
to
spite
one
face
we
disclaim
any
intent
to
pun
in
either
case
it
is
such
a
full
and
giving
of
himself
or
herself
away
on
the
part
of
the
patient
while
on
that
of
its
object
is
he
or
she
worth
it
now
from
a
very
acute
form
of
this
insanity
george
falkner
was
a
chronic
sufferer
he
had
cherished
a
secret
weakness
for
lilith
almost
when
she
was
yet
in
short
frocks
but
since
her
return
from
england
from
the
moment
he
had
once
more
set
eyes
upon
her
on
the
deck
of
the
he
had
tumbled
madly
uncontrollably
headlong
in
love
did
a
member
of
the
opposite
sex
so
much
as
exchange
commonplaces
with
her
george
falkner
personality
would
contrive
to
loom
grim
and
dark
and
almost
threatening
in
the
background
while
such
male
animal
who
should
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
say
an
hour
of
lilith
society
even
with
no
more
flirtatious
or
ultimate
intent
than
the
same
period
spent
in
the
society
of
his
grandmother
would
inspire
in
george
a
fell
murderousness
which
was
nothing
short
of
a
reversion
to
first
principles
as
for
lilith
herself
she
was
fond
of
him
very
in
a
sisterly
cousinly
way
and
what
way
indeed
could
be
more
fatal
to
that
by
which
he
desired
to
travel
nor
did
it
mend
matters
any
that
their
mutual
relatives
were
the
reverse
of
favourable
to
his
aspirations
on
the
ground
of
the
near
relationship
existing
between
the
parties
so
poor
george
seeing
no
light
became
morose
and
quarrelsome
and
wholly
and
violently
unreasonable
in
short
a
bore
all
of
which
was
a
pity
because
this
weakness
apart
he
was
on
the
whole
rather
a
good
fellow
he
had
come
to
the
rand
like
everybody
else
to
wait
for
the
boom
which
boom
like
the
chariots
of
israel
though
totally
unlike
the
children
of
the
same
tarried
long
in
coming
indeed
by
that
time
there
were
not
wanting
those
who
feared
that
it
might
not
come
at
all
he
had
pleaded
with
his
aunt
to
invite
lilith
at
the
same
time
artfully
putting
it
that
the
opportunity
of
his
escort
was
too
good
to
be
missed
and
falkner
with
whom
he
was
a
prime
favourite
although
she
did
not
approve
his
aspirations
weakly
agreed
and
so
here
they
were
beneath
the
same
roof
with
the
addition
of
his
second
sister
the
mabel
whose
acquaintance
we
have
already
made
the
latter
in
her
soft
pink
and
roses
style
was
a
very
pretty
girl
she
for
her
part
could
count
coup
to
a
creditable
extent
and
among
the
latest
scalps
which
she
had
hung
to
her
dainty
girdle
was
that
of
our
friend
holmes
this
idiot
we
were
going
to
say
looked
back
upon
that
deadly
monotonous
starved
dusty
of
three
days
and
two
nights
as
a
species
of
elysium
and
in
the
result
was
perennially
importuning
laurence
to
take
a
stroll
down
to
booyseus
just
for
a
constitutional
you
know
and
the
latter
would
laugh
and
acquiesce
it
was
a
cheap
way
of
setting
up
a
character
for
amiability
he
would
say
to
himself
satirically
for
as
yet
holmes
hardly
suspected
he
was
almost
as
powerfully
drawn
thither
as
holmes
was
himself
more
powerfully
perhaps
only
with
the
advantage
of
years
and
experience
and
cooler
brain
he
had
himself
more
in
hand
instead
of
making
a
prize
gooseberry
of
me
holmes
as
a
very
appropriate
item
against
the
season
he
said
one
day
you
had
much
better
go
over
by
yourself
you
are
getting
into
falkner
black
books
he
hates
me
like
poison
you
know
but
that
just
why
i
want
you
along
stanninghame
while
he
trying
to
stand
you
off
in
the
other
quarter
i
in
it
do
you
see
replied
the
other
with
ingenuousness
holmes
had
stated
no
more
than
the
truth
of
all
the
rivals
real
or
imaginary
whom
the
jealous
george
hated
and
feared
rival
none
could
touch
laurence
stanninghame
for
by
this
time
it
had
become
patent
to
his
watchful
eyes
that
among
the
swarms
of
visitors
of
the
male
and
therefore
to
him
obnoxious
sex
at
whose
coming
lilith
glance
would
brighten
and
with
whom
she
would
converse
with
a
kind
of
affectionate
confidentiality
when
others
were
present
and
apparently
even
more
so
when
others
were
not
that
objectionable
personage
was
the
said
laurence
stanninghame
this
being
the
case
it
followed
that
george
falkner
looking
out
on
the
one
fine
afternoon
and
descrying
the
approach
of
his
bugbear
stifled
a
bad
or
two
and
then
exploded
aloud
in
more
approved
and
passworthy
fashion
there
that
bounder
coming
here
again
being
dutch
for
somebody
you
detest
eh
george
said
lilith
sweetly
confound
it
that
everlasting
trying
to
be
sharp
is
one
of
the
most
deadly
things
a
man
has
to
put
up
with
it
catching
eh
lilith
was
the
sneering
retort
but
who
is
it
said
falkner
who
was
or
affected
to
be
oh
the
great
god
stanninghame
of
course
and
his
pup
holmes
now
the
george
had
stirred
up
a
hornet
nest
for
his
sister
took
up
the
parable
well
there
are
lessons
to
be
learned
even
from
said
mabel
scathingly
they
are
not
growling
at
any
rate
oh
you
on
the
smart
lay
too
did
i
say
it
was
catching
he
jeered
yes
and
you
say
a
great
many
things
that
are
supremely
foolish
retorted
mabel
turning
up
her
nose
a
little
more
in
fine
scorn
well
i
off
to
the
camp
said
george
with
a
sort
of
snarl
reaching
for
a
hat
clearly
i
not
wanted
here
you
not
if
you
going
to
do
nothing
but
make
yourself
fiendishly
disagreeable
rejoined
his
sister
pertly
pitiless
in
reality
she
was
very
fond
of
him
and
he
of
her
but
he
had
trampled
on
a
tender
place
for
she
liked
holmes
george
banged
on
his
hat
strode
angrily
to
the
door
and
got
no
farther
he
did
not
see
why
he
should
leave
the
field
clear
to
all
comers
even
if
he
were
out
of
the
running
himself
a
line
of
irresoluteness
which
affords
an
excellent
exemplification
of
the
remarks
wherewith
we
have
opened
this
chapter
by
all
but
george
who
was
excusably
undemonstrative
the
two
new
arrivals
were
greeted
with
customary
cordiality
why
stanninghame
it
seems
quite
a
long
time
since
we
saw
you
last
said
falkner
as
they
were
all
seated
out
on
the
what
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
the
usual
thing
studying
the
share
market
and
talking
about
it
and
is
the
outlook
still
as
bad
as
it
was
worse
however
we
must
hope
it
go
better
i
hear
that
you
and
that
queer
man
hazon
have
become
such
friends
mr
stanninghame
this
was
the
sort
of
remark
with
which
laurence
had
scant
patience
the
more
so
that
it
met
him
at
every
turn
what
concern
was
it
of
the
rand
collectively
who
he
chose
to
be
friendly
with
that
every
third
person
he
met
should
rap
out
such
kind
of
comment
oh
we
get
along
all
right
falkner
he
answered
but
then
i
have
a
special
faculty
for
hitting
it
off
with
unpopular
persons
possibly
a
kind
of
besides
accepting
judgments
concerning
other
people
does
not
commend
itself
to
my
mind
on
any
score
of
logic
or
sound
sense
it
is
just
a
trifle
less
insane
than
taking
up
other
people
quarrels
but
only
just
i
dare
say
you
right
only
it
is
difficult
for
most
of
us
to
be
so
consistently
so
faultlessly
logical
no
doubt
most
of
the
things
they
say
about
him
are
not
true
but
what
are
most
of
the
things
they
say
falkner
now
i
for
my
part
never
can
get
anybody
to
anything
they
will
hint
unutterables
and
look
unutterables
but
when
it
comes
to
no
thank
you
they
are
not
taking
any
but
he
is
such
a
very
mysterious
personage
not
a
soul
here
knows
anything
about
him
about
his
affairs
i
mean
and
who
he
is
perhaps
that
enhances
his
attractiveness
in
my
eyes
falkner
there
is
prestige
in
the
unknown
not
of
a
good
kind
as
a
rule
she
replied
and
then
stopped
short
for
a
dry
malicious
cough
on
the
part
of
george
brought
home
to
her
the
consciousness
that
she
was
putting
her
foot
in
it
pretty
effectively
for
the
same
held
good
of
the
man
to
whom
she
was
talking
about
laurence
stanninghame
and
his
affairs
not
a
soul
there
knew
anything
not
a
soul
yes
one
peradventure
for
between
himself
and
lilith
the
interchange
of
ideas
had
been
plenteous
and
frequent
and
the
subtile
sympathetic
vein
existing
between
them
had
deepened
and
grown
apace
about
himself
and
his
affairs
he
had
her
nothing
yet
it
is
probable
that
he
could
tell
her
but
little
on
this
head
that
would
be
news
in
any
sense
of
the
word
lilith
aunt
however
who
was
a
soul
without
a
grain
of
malice
in
her
composition
felt
supremely
uncomfortable
and
quite
savage
with
george
who
was
now
grinning
sourly
and
significantly
none
of
this
was
lost
upon
laurence
but
he
showed
no
consciousness
he
knew
that
george
falkner
detested
him
detested
him
cordially
yet
he
in
no
wise
reciprocated
this
dislike
he
did
not
blame
george
probably
he
would
have
felt
the
same
way
himself
had
he
been
in
george
place
and
at
george
age
for
the
latter
had
the
advantage
of
him
on
the
side
of
youth
by
at
least
ten
years
he
was
inclined
to
like
him
and
at
any
rate
was
sorry
for
him
perhaps
with
a
dash
of
pity
that
came
near
contempt
poor
george
did
give
himself
away
so
and
it
was
so
foolish
so
supremely
foolish
yet
not
for
a
moment
did
it
occur
to
laurence
to
efface
himself
in
this
connection
duty
hang
duty
he
had
made
a
most
ruinous
muddle
of
his
whole
life
through
reverencing
that
fetich
word
honour
there
was
no
breach
of
honour
where
there
was
no
deception
no
pretence
consideration
for
others
who
on
earth
ever
dreamt
of
considering
him
when
to
do
so
would
cost
them
anything
that
is
unselfishness
everybody
was
selfish
everything
even
what
had
he
ever
gained
by
striving
to
improve
upon
the
universal
law
nothing
nothing
good
everything
bad
bad
and
deteriorating
morally
and
physically
and
now
should
he
put
the
goblet
from
his
lips
not
he
this
strong
new
wine
of
life
had
rejuvenated
him
its
rich
sweet
fumes
so
far
from
clouding
his
brain
had
cleared
it
it
had
enwrapped
his
heart
in
a
glow
as
of
fire
and
caused
the
stagnated
blood
to
course
once
more
through
his
veins
warm
and
strong
and
free
his
very
step
had
gained
an
elasticity
a
firmness
to
which
it
had
long
been
strange
and
yet
with
all
this
his
judgment
had
remained
undimmed
keen
clear
subject
to
no
illusions
the
logic
of
the
situation
was
rather
pitiless
perchance
cruel
he
was
under
no
sort
of
illusion
on
that
score
well
let
it
be
here
again
came
in
the
universal
law
of
life
the
battle
of
the
strong
there
was
no
weakness
left
in
him
for
my
part
i
like
hazon
cut
in
holmes
decisively
he
only
wants
knowing
and
because
he
does
let
himself
go
for
the
benefit
of
every
bounder
on
the
rand
they
talk
about
him
as
if
he
committed
no
end
of
murders
it
my
belief
that
half
the
fellows
who
abuse
him
are
ten
thousand
times
worse
than
him
he
added
with
the
robust
partisanship
of
hearty
youth
further
discussion
of
hazon
and
his
derelictions
real
or
imaginary
was
cut
short
by
the
arrival
of
more
visitors
mostly
of
the
sterner
sex
for
falkner
liked
her
acquaintance
to
drop
in
informally
a
predilection
her
acquaintance
if
young
and
especially
of
the
harder
sex
aforesaid
for
obvious
reasons
delighted
just
at
present
to
humour
george
however
in
no
wise
shared
his
aunt
expansiveness
in
this
direction
if
only
that
it
meant
that
lilith
was
promptly
surrounded
by
an
adoring
phalanx
even
as
on
the
deck
of
the
now
it
was
voted
cool
enough
for
lawn
tennis
for
which
distraction
indeed
some
of
the
were
suitably
attired
and
there
was
keen
competition
for
lilith
as
a
partner
and
holmes
being
first
in
the
field
resolutely
bore
off
mabel
falkner
as
his
auxiliary
and
george
realizing
that
he
was
out
of
it
for
some
time
to
come
perhaps
too
taking
a
vague
comfort
in
the
thought
that
there
is
safety
in
numbers
actually
did
proceed
to
carry
out
his
threat
and
betook
himself
townwards
laurence
remained
seated
on
the
talking
to
falkner
and
one
of
the
visitors
but
all
the
while
though
never
or
answering
at
random
his
eyes
were
following
with
a
soothing
and
restful
sense
of
enjoyment
every
movement
of
lilith
form
a
very
embodiment
of
grace
and
supple
ease
he
pronounced
it
the
movement
of
the
game
suited
her
as
it
suited
but
few
she
never
seemed
to
grow
hot
or
flurried
or
dishevelled
as
so
many
of
the
fair
are
wont
to
do
while
engaged
in
that
popular
pastime
every
movement
was
one
of
unstudied
unconscious
grace
in
point
of
hard
fact
she
played
indifferently
but
she
did
so
in
a
manner
that
was
infinitely
good
to
look
at
do
you
play
at
this
mr
stanninghame
said
the
other
visitor
or
have
you
got
a
soul
above
such
frivolities
that
does
exactly
express
it
he
answered
the
truth
is
i
derive
sufficient
enjoyment
from
skipping
about
on
one
or
both
legs
at
the
end
of
a
racket
making
frantic
attempts
to
stop
a
ball
which
the
other
side
is
making
equally
frantic
and
fruitless
efforts
to
drive
at
me
through
a
net
as
a
dispassionate
observer
the
essence
of
the
game
seems
to
me
to
consist
in
sending
the
ball
against
the
net
as
hard
and
as
frequently
as
practicable
at
this
the
visitor
spluttered
and
being
of
the
softer
sex
declared
that
he
must
be
a
most
dreadful
cynic
and
lilith
who
was
near
enough
to
hear
his
remarks
turned
her
head
with
a
rippling
flash
of
mirth
in
her
eyes
and
said
thank
you
which
diversion
indeed
caused
her
to
perform
the
very
feat
he
had
been
so
whimsically
describing
presently
growing
tired
of
talking
he
withdrew
from
the
others
it
happened
that
there
was
a
book
in
the
drawing
room
which
had
caught
his
attention
during
a
former
visit
and
now
he
sought
it
and
taking
it
up
from
the
table
stood
there
alone
in
the
cool
shaded
room
turning
from
page
to
page
absorbed
in
comparing
passages
of
its
contents
then
a
light
step
a
rustle
of
skirts
a
lilt
of
song
which
broke
off
short
as
he
raised
his
eyes
lilith
was
passing
through
her
tennis
racket
still
in
her
hand
slightly
flushed
with
her
recent
exercise
she
looked
radiantly
sweet
in
her
dark
brilliant
beauty
oh
i
did
know
anyone
was
here
least
of
all
you
she
said
you
startled
me
sorceress
remove
those
unholy
spells
for
thou
art
indeed
good
to
look
upon
this
day
she
flashed
a
smile
at
him
throwing
back
her
head
with
that
slight
quick
movement
which
constituted
in
her
a
very
subtile
and
potent
charm
flatterer
do
you
think
so
well
i
am
glad
she
dropped
her
hand
down
upon
his
as
it
rested
on
the
table
with
a
swift
light
caressing
pressure
and
her
eyes
softened
entrancingly
as
they
looked
up
into
his
then
she
was
gone
he
stood
there
cool
immovable
outwardly
still
to
all
appearance
intent
upon
the
book
which
he
held
but
in
reality
he
saw
it
not
his
whole
mental
faculties
were
called
into
play
to
endeavour
imagination
to
retain
that
soft
light
pressure
upon
his
hand
his
resources
of
memory
were
concentrated
upon
the
picture
of
her
as
she
stood
there
a
moment
since
lovely
smiling
enchanting
and
then
the
sombre
reminding
of
the
hopelessness
the
mockery
of
inexorable
circumstance
would
roll
in
upon
his
mind
and
heart
would
seem
tightened
crushed
strangled
with
a
pain
that
was
actually
physical
of
such
acuteness
indeed
that
had
that
organ
been
weak
he
would
be
in
danger
of
falling
dead
on
the
spot
and
this
was
a
part
of
the
penalty
he
had
to
pay
for
his
superhuman
he
loved
her
this
man
who
loved
nothing
and
nobody
living
not
even
himself
he
loved
her
this
man
whose
life
was
all
behind
him
and
whose
heart
was
of
stone
and
whose
speech
was
acrid
as
the
most
corrosive
element
known
to
chemistry
but
a
few
passes
of
sweet
sorceress
lilith
magical
wand
and
the
stone
heart
had
split
to
fragments
pouring
forth
giving
release
to
a
warm
a
a
very
torrent
deep
fierce
strong
but
not
irresistible
as
yet
still
there
were
moments
when
to
keep
it
penned
within
its
limits
was
agony
agony
untold
superhuman
unendurable
he
loved
her
he
who
was
bound
by
legal
ties
until
death
with
all
the
strong
concentrative
might
of
his
otherwise
hard
nature
he
loved
her
the
dead
dismal
failure
of
the
past
the
sombre
vistas
of
the
future
were
as
nothing
compared
with
such
moments
as
this
yet
none
suspected
so
marvellously
did
he
hold
himself
in
hand
even
the
most
jealous
of
those
who
saw
them
frequently
together
george
falkner
for
instance
and
others
were
blind
and
unsuspecting
but
what
of
lilith
herself
chapter
viii
dark
days
the
share
market
at
johannesburg
was
rapidly
going
to
the
deuce
some
there
were
who
ardently
wished
that
johannesburg
itself
had
gone
thither
before
they
had
heard
of
its
unlucky
and
delusive
existence
and
among
this
daily
increasing
number
might
now
be
reckoned
laurence
stanninghame
he
infected
with
the
gambler
fever
of
speculation
had
not
thought
it
worth
while
to
hedge
it
was
to
be
all
or
nothing
and
now
as
things
turned
out
it
was
nothing
the
old
story
a
fictitious
market
bolstered
up
by
fictitious
and
inflated
prices
a
sudden
slump
and
then
everybody
with
one
mind
eager
to
dispose
of
scrip
barely
worth
the
paper
of
which
it
consisted
in
fact
unsaleable
king
scrip
had
landed
his
devoted
subjects
in
a
pretty
hole
you
not
the
only
one
stanninghame
no
not
by
a
long
long
chalk
said
rainsford
ruefully
as
they
were
talking
matters
over
one
day
hard
hit
myself
and
i
could
point
you
out
men
here
who
were
worth
tens
of
thousands
a
month
ago
and
could
muster
a
hard
hundred
cash
at
this
moment
if
their
lives
depended
on
it
worse
too
men
whose
overdraft
is
nearly
as
big
as
their
capital
was
the
same
time
back
i
suppose
so
yet
most
fellows
of
that
kind
are
adepts
at
the
fine
old
business
quality
of
besting
their
neighbours
one
in
which
i
am
totally
lacking
possibly
owing
to
want
of
practice
they
can
go
smash
and
come
up
smiling
and
in
a
little
while
be
worth
more
than
ever
they
know
how
to
do
it
you
see
and
i
do
smash
for
me
means
smash
and
that
of
a
signally
grievous
kind
rainsford
looked
at
him
curiously
oh
bother
it
stanninghame
you
no
worse
off
than
the
rest
of
us
we
got
to
lie
low
and
hang
on
for
a
bit
and
watch
our
chances
possibly
you
are
right
rainsford
no
doubt
you
are
still
every
donkey
knows
where
his
own
saddle
galls
him
rather
old
chap
replied
the
other
whose
hat
covered
the
total
of
his
liability
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
hold
on
tight
have
a
drink
and
trust
in
providence
we
go
and
have
the
drink
they
adjourned
to
a
convenient
bar
it
was
about
noon
and
the
place
was
fairly
full
here
they
found
holmes
in
the
middle
of
a
crowd
also
rankin
and
wheeler
the
consumption
of
john
walker
was
proceeding
at
a
brisk
rate
hallo
stanninghame
how
are
you
cried
rankin
have
seen
you
for
a
long
time
i
think
another
would
hurt
us
eh
what
do
you
say
i
doing
bitters
nothing
like
angostura
with
a
little
drop
of
gin
in
it
gives
tone
to
the
system
what
yours
laurence
named
his
and
the
genial
rankin
having
shouted
for
it
and
other
rounds
proceeded
to
unfold
some
wondrous
scheme
by
which
he
was
infallibly
bound
to
retrieve
all
their
fortunes
at
least
cent
per
cent
it
was
only
a
matter
of
a
little
capital
anyone
who
had
the
foresight
to
intrust
him
with
a
few
hundreds
might
consider
his
fortune
made
but
somehow
nobody
could
be
found
to
hand
over
those
few
hundreds
in
point
of
fact
nobody
had
got
them
here
rainsford
sung
out
somebody
we
are
tossing
for
another
round
wo
your
friend
cut
in
laurence
did
cut
in
and
then
holmes
who
being
of
genial
disposition
and
very
hard
hit
too
in
the
scrip
line
began
uproariously
to
suggest
a
further
drown
care
excuse
me
eh
holmes
said
laurence
it
getting
too
thick
and
i
do
think
this
is
a
sort
of
care
that
bear
drowning
i
off
everybody
hold
on
stanninghame
sung
out
rankin
who
was
the
most
hospitable
soul
alive
come
round
to
the
house
and
dine
with
us
i
just
going
along
we
better
do
another
bitters
though
first
what
do
you
say
but
laurence
declined
both
hospitalities
a
very
dark
mood
was
upon
him
one
which
rendered
the
idea
of
the
society
of
his
fellows
distasteful
to
the
last
degree
so
he
left
the
carousing
crowd
and
betook
himself
to
his
quarters
now
the
method
of
drowning
care
as
thus
practised
commended
itself
to
him
on
no
principle
of
practical
efficacy
he
had
care
enough
to
drown
heaven
knew
but
against
any
temptation
to
fly
to
the
bottle
in
order
to
swamp
it
he
was
proof
his
very
cynicism
selfish
egotistical
as
it
might
be
in
its
hard
and
sweeping
ruthlessness
was
a
safeguard
to
him
in
this
connection
that
he
laurence
stanninghame
to
whom
the
vast
bulk
of
mankind
represented
a
commingling
of
rogue
and
fool
in
about
equal
proportion
should
ever
come
to
render
himself
unsteady
on
his
feet
and
hardly
responsible
for
the
words
which
came
from
his
brain
presented
a
picture
so
unutterably
degraded
and
loathsome
that
his
mind
recoiled
from
the
barest
contemplation
of
it
yes
he
had
care
enough
in
all
conscience
that
day
as
he
walked
back
to
his
quarters
for
unless
the
market
took
a
turn
for
the
better
so
sudden
as
to
be
almost
miraculous
the
time
when
he
would
any
longer
have
a
roof
over
his
head
might
be
counted
by
weeks
and
now
every
mail
brought
him
grumbling
querulous
letters
asking
for
money
when
there
was
none
to
send
bitter
and
contentious
letters
full
of
complaint
and
the
raking
up
of
old
sores
and
lamentation
gibing
reproaches
too
to
him
who
had
beggared
himself
that
these
might
live
it
would
have
been
burden
enough
had
it
mattered
greatly
to
him
whether
anyone
in
the
world
lived
or
not
but
here
the
burden
was
tenfold
by
reason
of
its
utter
lack
of
appreciation
of
common
gratitude
of
consideration
for
the
shoulders
which
sorely
weighed
down
and
chafed
yet
still
supported
it
but
if
the
refuge
which
is
the
resort
of
the
weak
held
out
no
temptation
to
him
there
was
another
refuge
of
which
the
exact
opposite
held
good
in
weird
and
gloomy
form
all
the
recollections
and
failures
of
his
past
life
would
rise
up
and
confront
him
what
an
unutterable
hash
he
had
made
of
it
and
its
opportunities
it
did
not
do
to
run
straight
the
world
was
not
good
enough
for
it
so
he
had
found
that
for
the
past
for
the
future
what
nothing
for
some
there
was
no
future
and
he
was
one
of
these
he
saw
no
light
lying
on
his
bed
in
the
heat
of
the
early
afternoon
he
realized
all
this
for
the
hundredth
time
the
temptation
to
end
it
all
was
strong
upon
him
stronger
and
stronger
it
grew
as
though
shadowy
were
hovering
in
the
shaded
room
it
grew
until
it
was
overmastering
his
eyes
began
to
wander
meaningly
towards
a
locked
drawer
and
he
half
rose
against
this
temptation
his
hardened
cynicism
was
no
safeguard
at
all
rather
did
it
tend
to
foster
it
and
that
by
reason
of
a
corrosive
disgust
with
life
and
the
conditions
thereof
which
it
engendered
within
him
then
in
his
state
a
sweet
and
softening
influence
seemed
to
steal
in
upon
his
soul
he
thought
he
would
like
to
see
lilith
ormskirk
once
more
was
it
foolishness
weakness
not
a
bit
rather
was
it
hard
logical
philosophy
he
had
made
an
unparalleled
hash
of
life
if
he
were
going
to
leave
it
now
it
was
sound
logic
to
do
so
with
as
it
were
a
sweet
taste
upon
his
mental
palate
was
it
an
omen
for
good
an
earnest
of
a
turn
in
the
wheel
of
on
reaching
booyseus
he
was
so
fortunate
as
to
find
lilith
not
only
at
home
but
alone
her
face
lighted
up
at
the
sight
of
him
how
sweet
of
you
to
toil
out
here
this
hot
afternoon
she
said
as
he
took
within
his
the
two
hands
she
had
instinctively
held
out
to
him
for
a
moment
he
looked
at
her
without
replying
contrasting
the
grim
motive
which
had
brought
him
hither
with
this
perfect
embodiment
of
youth
and
health
and
beauty
with
all
of
life
all
of
the
future
yet
before
her
all
of
life
with
its
possibilities
she
was
in
radiant
spirits
and
the
hazel
eyes
shone
entrancingly
and
the
slight
flush
under
the
dark
warmth
of
the
satin
skin
caused
by
the
unaffected
pleasure
inspired
by
his
arrival
rendered
even
his
strong
head
a
trifle
unsteady
as
though
with
a
rich
sweet
overpowering
intoxication
well
the
reward
is
great
he
answered
still
retaining
her
hands
in
a
lingering
pressure
are
you
all
alone
child
yes
she
said
that
pleased
flush
mantling
again
the
diminutive
sounding
strangely
sweet
to
her
ears
as
coming
from
him
but
you
we
may
not
be
much
longer
people
might
drop
in
at
any
moment
and
i
want
to
be
alone
with
you
this
afternoon
i
am
spoiling
for
one
of
our
long
talks
so
put
on
a
hat
and
come
for
a
stroll
across
the
veldt
or
is
it
too
hot
you
know
it
is
not
she
answered
now
i
wo
be
a
minute
she
was
as
good
as
her
word
for
she
reappeared
almost
immediately
with
a
hat
and
sunshade
and
they
set
forth
striking
out
over
the
bare
open
veldt
which
extended
around
and
behind
the
booyseus
estate
the
heat
was
great
greater
than
most
women
would
have
cared
to
face
but
the
blue
cloudlessness
of
the
sky
the
sheeny
glow
of
the
sun
upon
the
free
open
country
was
so
much
delight
to
lilith
ormskirk
in
her
love
for
all
that
was
bright
and
glowing
she
was
a
true
daughter
of
the
south
oh
laurence
how
good
it
is
to
live
she
exclaimed
as
they
stepped
out
at
a
brisk
pace
in
the
glorious
openness
of
the
warm
air
do
you
know
i
feel
at
times
so
bright
and
well
and
happy
in
the
very
joy
and
thankfulness
of
being
alive
that
it
almost
brings
tears
do
you
understand
the
feeling
tell
me
i
think
so
but
did
you
ever
feel
that
way
yourself
perhaps
in
fact
i
must
have
because
i
understand
so
thoroughly
what
you
mean
but
it
must
have
been
a
very
very
long
time
ago
his
tone
was
that
of
one
gravely
amused
indulgently
caressing
heavens
he
was
thinking
the
contrast
here
was
quite
delicious
in
fact
it
was
unique
if
only
lilith
could
have
seen
into
his
thoughts
at
that
moment
if
only
she
had
had
the
faintest
inkling
as
to
their
nature
an
hour
or
so
back
still
something
in
his
look
or
in
his
tone
sobered
her
ah
laurence
forgive
me
she
cried
how
unfeeling
i
am
throwing
my
at
you
in
this
way
when
things
are
going
so
badly
with
you
unfeeling
why
child
i
love
to
see
you
rejoicing
in
the
bright
happiness
of
your
youth
and
glowing
spirits
i
would
not
have
you
otherwise
for
all
the
world
no
i
ought
not
to
feel
that
way
just
now
when
you
when
so
many
all
round
us
are
passing
through
such
a
dreadfully
anxious
and
critical
time
tell
me
laurence
are
things
brightening
for
you
even
a
little
not
even
a
little
the
case
is
all
the
other
way
but
do
you
think
about
it
child
be
happy
while
you
can
and
as
long
as
you
can
it
is
the
worst
possible
philosophy
to
afflict
yourself
over
the
woes
of
other
people
now
the
tears
did
indeed
well
to
lilith
eyes
but
assuredly
this
time
they
were
not
tears
of
joy
and
thankfulness
one
or
two
even
fell
do
sneer
laurence
you
must
keep
the
satire
and
cynicism
for
all
the
world
if
you
will
but
keep
the
inner
side
of
your
nature
for
me
said
she
and
in
the
sweet
pleading
ring
in
her
voice
there
was
no
lack
of
feeling
now
you
have
had
about
ten
times
more
than
your
share
of
all
the
dark
and
bitter
side
of
life
you
will
not
refuse
my
sympathy
my
deepest
most
heartfelt
sympathy
will
you
dear
ah
would
that
it
were
only
of
any
use
at
all
your
sympathy
why
i
value
and
prize
it
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
in
fact
it
is
the
only
thing
in
the
world
i
do
value
any
use
at
all
it
is
of
some
use
of
incalculable
use
perhaps
a
smile
lit
up
the
clouded
sadness
of
her
face
if
i
only
thought
that
she
said
still
it
more
than
sweet
to
hear
you
say
so
tell
me
laurence
what
was
the
strange
sympathetic
magnetism
that
existed
between
us
from
the
very
first
yes
long
before
we
talked
together
i
was
conscious
of
it
if
you
were
not
a
sympathy
that
makes
it
easy
for
me
to
follow
you
when
you
talk
so
darkly
that
nobody
else
could
oh
there
is
such
a
sympathy
then
of
course
there
is
and
you
know
it
perhaps
tell
me
lilith
do
you
still
cherish
certain
fusty
and
antiquated
superstitions
which
make
that
good
results
and
beneficial
can
never
come
out
of
abstract
wrong
abstract
wrong
being
for
present
purposes
a
mere
conventionality
she
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
the
interchange
of
that
steady
silent
glance
was
sufficient
no
i
do
not
she
said
i
thought
not
well
that
being
so
you
can
perhaps
realize
of
what
as
you
put
it
that
sweetest
gift
of
your
deepest
most
heartfelt
sympathy
may
be
to
its
object
and
in
its
results
wholly
beneficial
do
you
follow
why
of
course
and
is
it
really
in
my
power
to
brighten
life
for
you
ever
so
little
ah
that
would
be
happiness
indeed
continue
to
think
so
then
for
it
is
in
your
power
to
do
just
that
and
you
are
doing
it
at
this
moment
and
child
when
you
feel
that
sense
of
boundless
elation
with
the
joy
of
living
add
this
to
the
happiness
you
are
feeling
not
to
lessen
but
to
enhance
it
i
will
do
that
laurence
she
said
and
if
the
consciousness
that
you
have
what
you
say
is
of
use
to
you
let
it
be
to
strengthen
you
strong
as
you
are
dear
there
must
come
hours
of
terrible
gloom
even
to
you
well
when
such
come
on
think
of
our
talk
and
strive
to
throw
them
off
because
of
it
because
of
the
strengthening
influences
of
it
thus
she
spoke
bravely
but
beneath
her
outwardly
sweet
serenity
a
hard
battle
was
being
waged
she
was
fighting
with
her
innermost
self
striving
hard
to
retain
her
she
would
not
even
raise
her
eyes
to
his
lest
she
should
lose
it
lest
she
should
betray
herself
and
all
the
while
the
chords
of
her
innermost
being
thrilled
and
quivered
with
an
indescribable
tenderness
taking
words
within
her
mind
my
laurence
my
love
my
ideal
what
would
i
not
do
to
brighten
life
for
you
you
for
whom
life
is
all
too
hard
i
would
draw
down
that
head
till
it
rested
on
my
breast
i
would
wind
my
arms
round
your
neck
and
whisper
into
your
tired
ear
words
of
comfort
and
of
soothing
and
of
love
ah
how
i
would
love
you
care
for
you
shield
your
ear
from
ever
being
hurt
by
a
discordant
word
and
i
would
draw
your
heart
within
mine
to
rest
there
and
would
feel
life
all
too
blissfully
ineffably
sweet
to
live
his
voice
broke
in
upon
her
meditations
causing
her
a
very
perceptible
start
so
rapt
were
they
what
is
the
subject
of
your
very
deep
thought
my
lilith
are
you
wreathing
some
strange
and
hitherto
unsuspected
spell
sorceress
the
tone
playful
half
sad
nearly
upset
her
then
and
there
was
it
with
design
that
after
the
first
keen
penetrating
gaze
he
half
averted
his
glance
i
am
afraid
i
am
poor
company
she
said
rather
lamely
i
must
have
been
silent
quite
a
long
time
i
was
thinking
thinking
out
some
knotty
problem
which
would
draw
down
your
superior
lordship
indulgent
pity
with
a
flash
of
all
her
former
bright
spirits
and
its
nature
if
you
will
promise
not
to
sneer
i
tell
you
you
will
well
then
i
was
thinking
whether
i
would
have
that
dress
done
up
with
mauve
sleeves
or
black
for
wednesday
week
whether
he
believed
her
or
not
it
was
impossible
to
determine
from
the
demeanour
wherewith
this
statement
was
received
she
was
inclined
to
think
he
did
which
spoke
volumes
for
his
tactfulness
and
is
it
not
of
the
very
essence
of
that
far
too
uncommon
virtue
to
impress
your
interlocutor
with
the
conviction
that
you
believe
exactly
as
he
or
she
wants
you
to
in
point
of
fact
there
was
something
heroically
pathetic
in
the
way
in
which
each
mind
strove
to
veil
from
the
other
its
inner
workings
while
every
day
showed
more
and
more
the
impossibility
of
keeping
up
the
figment
yet
for
all
this
there
were
times
when
the
possession
the
certainty
of
lilith
sympathy
she
had
called
it
would
fail
to
cheer
to
strengthen
darker
and
darker
grew
the
days
more
hopeless
the
prospect
and
soon
laurence
stanninghame
found
himself
not
merely
face
to
face
with
poverty
but
on
the
actual
verge
of
destitution
grim
fell
spectres
haunted
his
waking
hours
no
less
than
his
dreams
did
he
return
from
a
few
hours
of
hard
exercise
with
a
fine
appetite
that
healthy
possession
served
but
to
remind
him
how
soon
he
would
be
without
the
means
of
gratifying
it
he
pictured
himself
utterly
destitute
and
through
his
sleeping
visions
would
loom
hideous
spectres
of
want
and
degradation
day
or
night
waking
or
sleeping
it
was
ever
the
same
the
horror
of
the
position
was
ever
before
him
and
would
not
be
laid
his
mind
was
a
hell
to
him
his
heart
of
lead
his
hard
clear
brain
deadly
in
its
purpose
obviously
there
was
no
further
room
in
the
world
for
such
as
he
chapter
ix
his
guardian
angel
i
sell
my
immortal
soul
twenty
times
over
for
a
few
thousands
of
the
damnation
stuff
but
as
that
article
is
negotiable
why
better
make
an
end
of
the
whole
bother
thus
laurence
to
himself
though
unconsciously
aloud
his
room
was
an
end
one
on
the
and
the
door
was
open
the
time
was
the
middle
of
the
morning
and
he
sat
thinking
his
thoughts
were
black
and
bitter
as
how
indeed
should
they
be
otherwise
he
had
come
to
this
place
to
make
one
final
effort
to
retrieve
his
fortunes
that
effort
had
failed
he
had
put
what
little
remained
to
him
into
various
companies
awaiting
the
boom
and
no
boom
had
ensued
on
the
contrary
things
had
never
looked
more
dead
than
at
this
moment
never
since
the
rand
had
been
opened
up
the
bulk
of
the
scrip
owned
by
him
was
now
barely
saleable
at
any
price
for
the
residue
he
might
have
obtained
a
quarter
of
the
price
he
had
paid
for
it
he
was
ruined
he
was
not
alone
in
this
not
by
a
very
large
number
but
what
sort
of
consolation
was
that
he
had
received
letters
too
by
the
last
mail
money
money
that
was
their
burden
he
tossed
them
aside
half
read
what
mattered
anything
the
accursed
luck
which
had
followed
him
throughout
life
had
stuck
to
him
most
consistently
would
do
so
until
the
end
the
end
ha
had
not
the
end
come
what
more
was
left
more
squalor
more
deterioration
gradually
dragging
him
down
down
heaven
knew
what
he
might
come
to
what
final
degradation
might
not
be
his
the
end
yes
better
let
it
be
the
end
now
here
while
in
the
full
possession
of
his
faculties
in
the
full
possession
of
the
dignity
of
his
the
dead
blank
hopelessness
of
life
better
end
it
now
here
he
rose
and
went
to
the
open
door
all
was
quiet
the
occupants
of
the
other
rooms
were
away
drowning
their
cares
in
liquor
saloons
or
feverishly
hanging
around
to
grasp
at
any
possible
straw
he
was
about
to
close
the
door
no
it
had
better
remain
as
it
was
the
thing
would
look
more
accidental
that
way
he
returned
into
the
room
and
unlocking
his
portmanteau
took
out
a
it
was
loaded
in
every
chamber
for
in
those
days
such
a
companion
was
not
far
from
a
necessity
in
the
great
restless
he
sat
down
at
the
table
and
placing
the
weapon
in
front
of
him
passed
his
fingers
up
and
down
the
blue
shiny
metal
in
a
strange
way
then
grasping
the
butt
he
placed
the
muzzle
against
his
forehead
the
hard
metal
imprinted
a
cold
ring
just
between
the
eyes
he
did
not
flinch
at
the
grisly
contact
his
hand
was
as
firm
as
a
rock
he
must
depress
the
muzzle
just
a
trifle
it
would
make
more
certain
he
began
to
press
the
trigger
ever
so
faintly
then
a
little
more
firmly
strangely
wondering
how
much
more
imperceptible
a
degree
of
pressure
would
be
required
to
produce
the
roaring
shattering
shock
which
should
whirl
him
into
the
dark
night
of
death
well
but
afterwards
who
knew
if
it
were
as
they
taught
even
then
it
could
be
no
augmentation
of
the
hopelessness
of
this
life
perhaps
they
might
make
a
devil
of
him
he
thought
with
grim
satisfaction
as
a
black
wave
of
hatred
towards
humanity
at
large
surged
through
his
brain
in
that
eventuality
his
rôle
of
tormentor
as
well
as
tormented
would
be
a
congenial
one
the
dark
night
of
death
what
would
it
matter
about
money
then
and
all
the
sordid
and
pitiful
wretchednesses
entailed
by
the
want
of
it
a
leap
in
the
dark
it
held
all
the
excitement
of
an
unknown
adventure
to
the
man
who
sat
there
pressing
the
muzzle
of
the
deadly
weapon
hard
against
his
forehead
the
additional
pressure
of
so
much
as
a
hair
weight
upon
that
trigger
now
could
it
be
that
the
man
guardian
angel
was
with
him
still
that
a
saving
presence
really
hovered
about
him
in
the
prosaic
noonday
a
strange
chord
seemed
to
thrill
and
vibrate
within
his
brain
bringing
before
his
vision
the
face
of
lilith
ormskirk
there
it
was
as
he
had
beheld
it
but
a
few
days
since
but
now
the
sweet
eyes
were
troubled
as
though
clouded
with
pain
and
bitter
disappointment
you
whom
i
thought
so
strong
are
weak
after
all
you
to
whom
i
loved
to
listen
as
the
very
ideal
of
a
mind
and
judgment
are
about
to
do
what
will
stamp
your
memory
forever
as
that
of
one
who
was
insane
have
i
been
no
more
to
you
than
that
i
who
thought
to
have
brightened
and
strengthened
your
life
all
that
within
me
lay
it
can
not
be
you
shall
not
do
it
he
could
not
the
voice
thrilled
to
his
hearing
as
plainly
as
articulately
as
it
had
ever
done
when
she
had
stood
before
him
he
laid
down
the
weapon
and
passed
his
hand
in
a
dazed
sort
of
manner
over
his
brows
laurence
stanninghame
was
saved
he
stared
around
somewhat
unsteadily
as
though
more
than
half
expecting
to
behold
her
there
in
the
room
what
did
it
all
mean
at
any
rate
she
had
saved
him
was
it
for
good
or
for
ill
then
the
full
irony
of
the
position
struck
upon
his
satirical
soul
his
mind
went
back
over
his
acquaintance
with
lilith
what
if
his
disillusioning
had
been
a
little
less
complete
what
if
he
had
fled
the
rich
attractiveness
of
her
presence
had
shunned
her
with
heroic
scrupulousness
acting
from
some
notion
of
honour
just
this
he
laurence
stanninghame
would
at
that
moment
be
lying
a
lifeless
thing
with
brains
scattered
all
over
the
room
a
memory
a
standing
monument
of
commonplace
weakness
but
she
had
saved
him
from
this
had
saved
him
as
surely
and
completely
as
though
she
had
struck
the
weapon
from
his
hand
was
it
for
good
or
for
ill
he
fell
thinking
again
had
he
indeed
played
his
last
card
or
did
one
more
solitary
trump
yet
lurk
up
his
sleeve
unknown
to
himself
no
it
could
not
be
and
his
thoughts
grew
dark
again
yet
he
was
safe
now
safe
from
himself
lilith
had
done
it
her
influence
her
love
he
thought
long
and
thought
hard
but
still
hopelessly
and
again
unconsciously
he
broke
out
into
soliloquy
yes
i
sell
my
soul
to
the
devil
himself
maybe
the
old
man
would
be
dead
off
the
deal
likely
he
reckons
you
a
dead
cert
already
stanninghame
laurence
did
not
start
at
the
voice
which
was
that
of
hazon
whose
shadow
darkened
the
door
the
man
at
that
moment
especially
noticed
that
he
did
not
dare
say
you
right
hazon
was
the
reply
that
it
come
in
which
the
other
had
already
done
talking
out
loud
was
i
it
a
d
bad
habit
and
grows
on
one
it
does
say
though
what
game
were
you
up
to
with
that
plaything
glancing
meaningly
at
the
lying
on
the
table
this
oh
i
thought
likely
it
wanted
cleaning
so
and
the
corners
of
hazon
saturnine
mouth
drooped
in
ever
so
faint
a
grin
as
his
keen
eyes
fixed
themselves
for
a
moment
full
upon
the
other
face
laurence
had
forgotten
the
imprint
left
in
the
centre
of
his
forehead
by
the
muzzle
so
see
here
stanninghame
do
be
at
the
trouble
to
invent
any
more
sick
old
lies
but
put
the
thing
away
it
might
go
off
do
mind
me
i
been
through
the
same
stage
myself
have
you
how
did
it
feel
eh
said
laurence
with
a
sort
of
weary
imperturbability
filling
his
pipe
and
pushing
the
pouch
across
the
table
to
his
friend
bad
ah
that
right
instead
of
fooling
about
guns
at
such
times
fill
your
pipe
that
the
right
lay
depend
upon
it
laurence
made
no
reply
but
lighting
up
puffed
away
in
silence
his
thoughts
were
wandering
from
hazon
broke
eh
queried
the
latter
sententiously
stony
so
ah
i
knew
it
come
i
knew
it
come
this
remark
redolent
as
it
was
of
that
sort
of
cheap
prophecy
which
consists
of
being
wise
after
the
event
laurence
did
not
deem
worthy
of
answer
and
i
was
waiting
for
it
to
come
pursued
hazon
say
now
why
not
make
a
trip
up
country
with
me
that
sounds
likely
does
it
did
i
just
tell
you
i
was
stony
broke
you
did
the
very
reason
why
i
made
my
proposal
do
see
it
if
i
were
to
sell
out
every
rag
of
my
scrip
now
i
could
raise
enough
to
pay
my
shot
towards
the
outfit
and
i
even
render
service
in
kind
for
i
had
no
experience
of
waggons
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
so
where
does
it
come
in
it
does
come
in
you
can
render
service
in
kind
darned
much
so
i
do
want
you
to
pay
any
shot
towards
the
outfit
see
here
stanninghame
if
you
go
up
country
with
me
now
you
come
back
a
fairly
rich
man
or
or
what
you
never
come
back
at
all
in
spite
of
his
normal
imperturbability
laurence
was
conscious
of
a
quickening
of
the
pulses
the
suggestion
of
adventure
of
an
adventure
on
a
magnificent
scale
and
with
magnificent
results
if
successful
as
conveyed
in
the
other
reply
caused
the
blood
to
surge
hotly
through
his
frame
he
had
been
strangely
drawn
towards
this
dark
reticent
solitary
individual
beneath
whose
quiet
demeanour
lurked
such
a
suggestion
of
force
and
power
who
shunned
the
friendship
of
all
even
as
all
shunned
his
who
had
been
moderately
intimate
even
with
none
but
himself
this
wonderful
land
the
dim
mysterious
recesses
of
its
interior
what
possibilities
did
it
not
hold
and
in
groping
into
such
possibilities
this
above
all
others
was
the
comrade
he
would
have
chosen
to
have
at
his
side
not
that
he
had
forgotten
the
words
of
dark
warning
spoken
by
rainsford
and
others
but
at
such
he
laughed
are
you
taking
it
on
any
queried
hazon
after
a
pause
of
silence
on
the
part
of
both
i
am
i
do
mind
telling
you
hazon
that
life
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
was
no
great
thing
before
i
guessed
as
much
assented
the
other
with
a
nod
of
the
head
quite
now
i
broke
stony
broke
and
it
more
than
ever
a
case
of
stealing
away
to
hang
one
self
in
a
well
i
tell
you
squarely
walk
into
the
jaws
of
the
devil
himself
to
effect
the
capture
of
the
yes
how
are
your
nerves
stanninghame
hard
hard
as
nails
now
that
not
to
say
they
have
been
always
quite
so
ever
seen
a
man
head
cut
off
two
so
where
was
that
said
hazon
ever
so
faintly
surprised
at
receiving
an
affirmative
reply
in
paris
a
press
friend
of
mine
had
to
go
and
see
two
fellows
guillotined
and
managed
to
work
me
in
with
him
we
were
as
close
to
the
machine
too
as
it
was
possible
to
get
did
it
make
you
feel
sick
at
all
not
any
the
other
johnny
took
it
pretty
badly
though
i
had
to
fill
him
up
with
cocktails
before
he
could
eat
any
breakfast
that
a
very
good
test
i
never
expected
you
to
say
you
had
stood
it
well
you
may
see
a
little
more
in
that
line
before
we
come
through
ca
make
omelettes
without
breaking
eggs
though
as
the
french
say
well
now
stanninghame
i
had
my
eye
on
you
ever
since
you
came
up
here
i
pretty
good
at
reading
people
and
i
read
you
the
man
for
me
i
said
to
myself
come
to
the
end
of
his
tether
just
at
that
stage
of
life
when
it
kill
or
cure
and
he
means
kill
or
cure
well
we
had
talked
enough
together
to
let
you
into
that
much
eh
hazon
said
laurence
with
a
laugh
which
was
not
altogether
free
from
a
dash
of
scepticism
we
have
still
i
not
gassing
when
i
tell
you
i
knew
all
about
it
before
how
you
want
to
ask
because
i
been
through
it
all
myself
i
thought
chap
is
throwing
his
last
card
if
he
loses
he
my
man
and
you
have
lost
but
what
the
object
of
the
trip
hazon
gold
no
stones
not
stones
ivory
then
that
it
ivory
and
a
gleam
of
saturnine
mirth
shot
across
the
other
dark
features
you
have
to
go
a
good
way
up
for
that
now
do
you
hazon
yes
a
good
way
up
and
it
contraband
the
devil
it
is
hazon
nodded
then
he
went
to
the
door
and
looked
out
leave
it
open
it
better
so
we
can
hear
any
one
coming
he
said
returning
and
now
stanninghame
listen
carefully
and
we
talk
out
the
scheme
if
you
on
well
and
good
if
you
dead
off
it
why
i
told
you
i
had
read
you
and
you
not
the
man
to
let
drop
by
word
or
hint
to
a
living
soul
any
of
what
has
passed
between
us
quite
right
hazon
you
never
formed
a
safer
judgment
in
your
life
then
for
upwards
of
an
hour
the
pair
talked
together
and
when
the
luncheon
bell
rang
and
laurence
stanninghame
took
his
seat
at
the
table
along
with
the
rest
to
talk
scrip
in
the
scathingly
despondent
way
in
which
the
darling
topic
was
conversationally
dealt
with
in
these
days
he
was
conscious
that
he
had
turned
the
corner
of
a
curious
psychological
crisis
in
his
life
in
the
afternoon
he
took
his
way
down
to
booyseus
would
he
find
lilith
in
it
was
almost
too
much
good
luck
to
hope
to
find
her
alone
as
he
walked
he
was
filled
with
a
strange
elation
the
dull
pain
of
a
very
near
parting
was
largely
counteracted
by
the
manner
of
it
such
a
parting
had
been
before
his
mind
for
long
but
then
he
would
have
gone
forth
broken
down
ruined
more
utterly
without
hope
in
life
than
ever
now
it
was
different
he
was
going
forth
upon
an
adventure
fraught
with
all
manner
of
stirring
potentialities
one
from
which
he
would
return
wealthy
or
as
his
friend
and
thenceforth
comrade
had
said
one
from
which
he
would
not
return
at
all
had
his
luck
already
begun
to
turn
he
thought
as
he
mounted
the
lilith
herself
came
forth
to
meet
him
it
struck
him
that
the
omen
was
a
good
one
why
you
are
becoming
quite
a
stranger
she
said
but
the
note
of
gladness
underlying
the
reproach
did
not
escape
him
nor
a
certain
lighting
up
of
her
face
as
they
clasped
hands
with
the
subtile
lingering
pressure
now
never
absent
from
that
outwardly
formal
method
of
greeting
am
i
he
answered
thinking
how
soon
how
very
soon
he
would
become
one
in
reality
but
you
were
going
out
for
she
had
on
her
hat
and
gloves
and
carried
a
sunshade
i
was
you
are
only
just
in
time
only
just
but
i
wo
now
that
you
have
come
on
the
contrary
i
want
you
to
i
want
you
to
come
out
with
me
and
at
once
before
an
irruption
of
bores
renders
that
manoeuvre
impracticable
will
you
of
course
i
will
which
way
shall
we
go
up
to
the
town
not
much
right
in
the
opposite
direction
and
as
far
away
from
it
as
possible
are
you
alone
not
quite
alone
aunt
is
having
her
afternoon
sleep
but
may
and
george
went
to
the
town
this
morning
they
intended
to
have
lunch
at
the
stevensons
and
then
go
on
to
the
cricket
ground
there
a
match
or
something
on
george
was
cross
because
i
would
go
too
but
i
had
a
touch
of
headache
and
went
to
sleep
instead
and
oh
laurence
i
had
such
a
horrible
dream
it
was
about
you
oh
was
it
the
words
rapped
themselves
out
quickly
nervously
more
so
than
she
had
ever
heard
him
talk
before
but
the
awful
and
ghastly
crisis
of
the
morning
was
recalled
by
her
words
about
me
tell
it
to
me
i
ca
it
was
all
rather
vague
and
yet
so
real
i
dreamed
that
you
were
in
the
face
of
some
strange
some
horrible
danger
against
which
i
was
powerless
to
warn
you
i
struggled
to
even
prayed
then
i
was
able
i
warned
you
and
the
danger
seemed
to
pass
and
oh
laurence
i
woke
up
crying
your
dream
was
a
true
one
my
lilith
no
i
will
not
tell
you
how
or
in
what
way
and
will
you
always
be
empowered
to
warn
me
to
save
me
my
sweet
guardian
angel
i
shall
need
it
often
enough
during
the
next
er
in
the
time
that
is
coming
his
face
had
taken
on
an
unwonted
expression
and
his
tones
were
suspiciously
husky
lilith
looked
wonderingly
at
him
and
her
own
expression
was
grave
and
earnest
the
sweet
eyes
became
dewy
with
unshed
tears
you
know
i
will
if
i
may
she
answered
stealing
a
hand
into
his
for
a
sympathetic
pressure
as
they
walked
side
by
side
they
had
been
walking
at
a
good
pace
over
the
open
treeless
veldt
and
the
roofs
of
booyseus
were
now
quite
dwarfed
behind
them
but
tell
me
she
continued
are
things
any
better
oh
it
is
dreadful
that
you
should
have
come
all
this
way
only
to
be
more
completely
ruined
than
before
dreadful
i
am
always
thinking
about
it
yet
i
am
of
a
hopeful
disposition
as
i
told
you
i
never
despair
things
will
take
a
turn
they
must
they
have
taken
a
turn
lilith
but
not
in
the
direction
you
mean
i
am
going
away
she
started
she
knew
that
those
words
must
one
day
be
spoken
now
that
they
had
been
they
hurt
back
to
england
the
words
came
out
breathlessly
and
with
a
sort
of
gasp
no
not
there
i
am
going
up
country
into
the
interior
oh
there
was
relief
in
the
ejaculation
for
the
moment
she
lost
sight
of
all
that
was
involved
by
such
a
destination
they
would
still
be
in
the
same
land
that
was
something
or
seemed
so
now
all
the
latent
instincts
never
half
drawn
forth
surged
like
molten
volcano
fires
through
laurence
stanninghame
soul
the
dead
and
stormy
nature
slain
within
him
revivified
burst
forth
into
warm
pulsating
struggling
rebellious
life
this
striving
of
heart
against
heart
this
desperate
effort
still
to
patch
up
the
rents
in
the
flimsy
veil
moved
him
infinitely
the
veldt
on
the
witwatersrand
is
as
open
and
devoid
of
cover
as
a
the
two
were
visible
for
miles
but
for
this
he
knew
not
what
he
might
have
done
rather
he
knew
full
well
what
he
certainly
would
have
done
they
took
refuge
in
practical
topics
they
talked
of
the
trip
you
are
very
friendly
with
that
hazon
are
you
not
laurence
nobody
else
is
and
there
are
strange
stories
not
told
but
hinted
about
him
he
is
a
man
i
should
be
almost
afraid
of
and
yet
half
admire
he
strikes
me
as
one
who
would
be
a
terrible
and
relentless
enemy
but
as
true
as
steel
true
to
point
to
a
friend
that
exactly
my
opinion
now
hazon
and
i
suit
each
other
down
to
the
ground
i
have
an
especial
faculty
remember
for
getting
on
with
unpopular
individuals
thus
they
talked
and
at
length
time
forced
them
to
turn
their
steps
homeward
and
as
the
sun
rays
began
to
slant
golden
upon
the
surrounding
veldt
it
seemed
to
laurence
that
even
that
wilderness
took
on
a
glow
that
was
more
than
of
earth
how
that
afternoon
that
walk
would
dwell
within
his
memory
stamped
there
indelibly
he
thought
how
the
day
had
opened
of
that
gnawing
mental
struggle
culminating
in
what
but
for
this
girl
at
his
side
he
would
now
be
what
she
had
saved
him
she
alone
her
confidence
in
him
her
high
opinion
of
him
and
her
love
yes
her
love
he
looked
upon
her
as
she
walked
beside
him
entrancing
beyond
words
in
her
rich
warm
beauty
a
perfect
dream
of
grace
and
symmetry
even
the
hot
sunlight
seemed
to
linger
as
with
a
kiss
upon
the
dark
brilliant
loveliness
of
her
eyes
on
the
soft
curve
of
her
lips
you
are
cruel
sorceress
he
broke
forth
you
have
made
yourself
look
especially
enchanting
because
soon
i
shall
see
you
no
more
you
are
looking
perfect
she
flashed
a
bright
smile
upon
him
but
it
seemed
to
fade
into
a
shadow
as
of
pain
am
i
well
laurence
one
knows
instinctively
when
one
is
looking
best
it
would
be
affectation
to
pretend
otherwise
and
i
love
to
make
myself
look
bright
and
sweet
and
attractive
for
you
and
now
oh
dear
we
are
nearly
home
again
come
in
with
me
now
and
stay
the
evening
we
shall
not
be
alone
together
again
i
fear
this
evening
i
mean
but
you
will
be
going
away
so
soon
now
and
i
must
see
as
much
of
you
as
i
can
he
needed
no
persuasion
and
as
lilith
had
said
they
were
not
alone
together
again
but
even
the
jealous
george
who
came
back
from
the
town
more
cantankerous
than
ever
on
learning
of
this
addition
found
balm
in
gilead
that
brute
stanninghame
was
going
away
soon
he
put
it
heaven
send
a
convenient
shot
of
malaria
or
a
providential
assegai
prod
to
keep
him
there
forever
chapter
x
preparation
the
days
went
by
and
hazon
preparations
were
nearly
completed
and
it
became
patent
to
the
rand
at
large
that
the
pirate
intended
to
relieve
that
delusive
locality
of
his
unwelcome
presence
for
a
couple
of
waggons
appeared
on
the
scene
bearing
his
name
and
in
charge
of
a
mysterious
native
of
vast
proportions
and
forbidding
physiognomy
who
seemed
not
to
be
indigenous
to
those
parts
nor
indeed
to
hail
from
anywhere
around
and
hazon
in
his
quiet
thorough
way
was
very
busy
in
fitting
out
these
waggons
loading
them
with
articles
suitable
for
trade
eke
with
munitions
of
sport
and
if
need
be
war
wherein
he
was
ably
assisted
by
laurence
stanninghame
on
learning
that
the
latter
was
a
party
to
the
undertaking
whatever
it
was
the
rand
shrugged
its
shoulders
and
whispered
and
the
burden
of
its
whispering
consisted
mainly
of
the
ancient
innuendo
relating
to
those
who
had
heretofore
accompanied
hazon
anywhere
this
one
would
he
not
travel
the
same
dark
road
as
others
had
done
whatever
that
road
might
be
but
that
was
his
own
lookout
and
he
had
been
warned
and
the
two
men
would
hold
long
and
earnest
confabs
together
but
those
which
were
the
most
earnest
were
held
in
the
course
of
long
rides
away
into
the
veldt
then
they
would
dismount
at
some
sequestered
spot
where
secure
from
all
interruption
maps
and
plans
and
darkly
written
also
ciphers
would
be
produced
and
long
and
carefully
discussed
of
this
however
the
rand
knew
nothing
yet
from
such
laurence
would
return
feeling
a
trifle
graver
for
even
he
had
to
accustom
himself
to
such
a
road
to
wealth
as
was
here
held
out
but
his
case
was
desperate
he
was
utterly
ruined
and
to
the
same
extent
reckless
it
was
sink
or
swim
and
not
his
was
the
mind
to
elect
to
go
under
when
the
jettison
of
a
last
lingering
scruple
or
two
would
keep
him
afloat
as
for
potential
nay
certain
risk
that
did
not
enter
into
his
calculations
now
while
these
preparations
were
in
progress
holmes
was
going
about
with
a
very
gloomy
countenance
more
than
hinting
indeed
at
a
desire
to
take
part
in
the
trip
finally
he
put
it
plainly
to
laurence
himself
take
my
advice
and
watch
it
the
latter
decisively
replied
then
remembering
that
the
ostensible
object
of
the
undertaking
was
sport
and
native
trade
he
went
on
you
see
holmes
it
going
to
be
a
hard
business
not
just
three
or
four
months
up
in
the
and
so
forth
but
well
heaven
only
knows
where
the
thing
will
end
let
alone
how
i
do
care
about
that
why
it
just
the
very
thing
that
suit
me
down
to
the
ground
i
say
stanninghame
i
know
you
do
mind
but
hazon
i
always
stood
up
for
hazon
and
we
seem
to
get
on
all
right
do
put
it
to
hazon
i
could
pay
my
shot
of
course
there
was
a
despondency
of
manner
and
tone
that
was
extremely
foreign
to
the
mercurial
holmes
and
this
together
with
certain
signs
he
had
read
of
late
caused
laurence
to
look
up
with
a
queer
half
smile
why
are
you
so
anxious
to
clear
from
here
holmes
rather
sudden
it
oh
i
dead
off
waiting
for
a
that
never
comes
it
dashed
sickening
do
you
know
it
is
and
what
else
is
dashed
sickening
that
is
all
the
other
stared
for
a
moment
then
as
though
he
were
bringing
it
out
with
an
effort
he
burst
forth
oh
well
hang
it
all
stanninghame
i
do
see
why
i
should
tell
you
the
fact
is
i
i
got
the
chuck
laurence
laughed
inwardly
he
understood
why
i
thought
you
were
bringing
it
on
all
right
he
said
so
did
i
but
when
i
put
it
to
her
she
was
dead
off
said
holmes
disconsolately
savage
sure
cert
well
give
her
another
show
some
women
girls
especially
like
that
sort
of
application
twice
over
they
think
it
enhances
their
value
in
some
inexplicable
way
said
laurence
with
a
touch
of
characteristic
satire
i
do
but
that
a
matter
of
opinion
and
i
do
want
to
hurt
your
feelings
holmes
but
is
this
one
worth
it
i
do
know
answered
the
other
savagely
driving
his
heel
into
the
ground
it
that
beast
barstow
what
the
deuce
she
can
see
in
him
bangs
me
yes
unless
it
is
that
you
hold
a
quantity
of
unsaleable
scrip
and
he
does
rejoined
laurence
who
had
been
secretly
amused
in
watching
the
progress
of
pretty
mabel
falkner
latest
preference
but
in
any
case
i
think
you
better
not
touch
it
or
you
find
yourself
on
the
one
horn
or
other
of
this
dilemma
if
she
is
coming
the
trick
why
that
is
despicable
and
in
fact
not
good
enough
if
she
means
business
why
you
ca
go
begging
to
her
for
what
she
has
given
to
the
other
johnny
without
any
begging
at
all
see
oh
yes
i
see
was
the
rueful
rejoinder
by
the
lord
stanninghame
i
used
to
think
you
a
deuced
snarling
cynical
beggar
at
first
but
now
my
soul
i
believe
you
right
do
you
well
then
you
do
want
to
go
away
and
get
bowled
out
with
fever
or
struck
by
a
nigger
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
because
one
girl
do
care
a
cent
for
you
perhaps
not
still
i
hate
this
place
now
i
sick
of
it
by
the
way
stanninghame
you
the
sort
a
fellow
can
tell
anything
to
you
start
a
lot
of
cheap
blatant
chaff
as
some
chappies
do
when
you
want
them
to
talk
sound
sense
there
was
a
great
deal
underlying
the
remark
also
the
tone
though
lacking
the
elements
which
go
to
make
up
the
popular
man
laurence
possessed
the
faculty
of
winning
the
devoted
attachment
of
individuals
and
that
to
an
extent
of
which
he
himself
little
dreamed
not
the
least
important
item
which
went
to
make
up
that
attribute
lay
in
the
fact
that
he
was
a
most
indulgent
listener
whom
nothing
astonished
and
who
could
look
at
all
sides
of
any
given
question
with
the
tact
and
toleration
of
a
man
who
thinks
this
faculty
he
seldom
exercised
and
then
almost
unconsciously
to
the
other
remark
he
made
no
immediate
reply
taking
into
consideration
age
and
temperament
he
had
no
belief
that
rejection
and
disappointment
had
left
any
deep
wound
still
it
had
come
at
an
unfortunate
time
a
time
when
the
sufferer
in
common
with
most
of
them
had
been
hard
hit
in
a
more
material
way
he
had
a
genuine
liking
for
the
youth
a
liking
begotten
it
might
be
of
the
ingenuously
unconscious
manner
in
which
the
latter
looked
up
to
him
in
fact
made
a
sort
of
elder
brother
of
him
holmes
was
no
than
most
youngsters
of
his
temperament
and
circumstances
and
laurence
did
not
want
to
see
him
soured
and
dejected
by
disappointment
all
round
throw
himself
in
with
the
reckless
indiscriminate
of
whom
there
were
not
lacking
woeful
examples
in
those
days
though
poor
fellows
much
from
the
same
motive
to
drown
care
and
into
this
current
would
holmes
in
all
probability
be
swept
if
left
by
himself
in
johannesburg
was
there
no
method
of
taking
him
with
them
for
a
month
or
two
shoot
in
the
and
sending
him
back
by
some
returning
expedition
before
the
serious
part
of
the
undertaking
was
entered
upon
he
decided
to
sound
hazon
upon
the
matter
yet
of
this
resolve
he
said
nothing
now
to
holmes
the
latter
broke
the
silence
by
jove
stanninghame
i
envy
you
he
said
you
are
such
a
chap
why
i
do
believe
you
care
a
little
d
for
any
mortal
thing
in
the
world
yes
i
envy
you
you
need
if
it
means
hankering
after
the
process
by
which
that
blissful
state
is
attained
but
you
are
wrong
i
care
most
infernally
about
one
thing
and
what
that
what
is
it
old
chap
you
need
be
afraid
i
let
on
said
holmes
eagerly
anticipating
it
might
be
something
similar
in
the
way
of
a
confidence
to
that
which
his
own
exuberant
heart
had
not
been
able
to
refrain
from
making
why
that
i
was
stewed
idiot
enough
to
go
on
investing
in
this
infernal
scrip
instead
of
clearing
out
just
when
i
had
made
the
modest
profit
of
four
hundred
per
cent
oh
said
the
other
in
disappointed
surprise
adding
but
you
show
it
you
take
it
smiling
stanninghame
you
do
turn
a
hair
h
with
the
ejaculation
laurence
was
thinking
of
a
certain
room
shaded
from
the
glare
of
the
sunlight
without
and
of
a
very
grim
moment
indeed
he
was
looking
too
at
the
hearty
youngster
who
had
already
begun
to
forget
his
recent
disappointment
in
the
prospect
of
adventure
and
novelty
he
himself
had
been
nearly
as
just
as
ready
to
mirth
and
laughter
at
that
age
yet
now
would
it
be
the
same
with
this
one
who
could
say
the
suggestion
that
holmes
should
accompany
the
expedition
was
not
received
with
enthusiasm
by
hazon
neither
did
it
meet
with
immediate
and
decisive
repudiation
characteristically
hazon
proceeded
to
argue
out
the
matter
pro
and
con
he
does
know
the
real
nature
of
our
business
stanninghame
no
of
course
not
thinks
it
only
a
shooting
trip
good
well
the
question
is
are
we
dead
certain
of
finding
opportunities
for
sending
him
back
for
we
ca
turn
him
loose
on
the
veldt
and
say
there
are
several
places
where
we
might
drop
him
said
laurence
consulting
a
map
and
mentioning
a
few
quite
so
well
here
another
consideration
he
a
youngster
and
probably
has
scores
of
relations
more
or
less
interested
in
him
we
do
want
to
draw
down
inquiries
and
investigations
into
our
movements
and
affairs
that
wo
count
seriously
hazon
think
not
um
well
then
what
if
we
were
to
take
him
along
run
him
into
the
whole
shoot
with
us
phew
that
a
horse
whose
colour
i
never
scrutinized
and
the
point
might
help
us
in
more
ways
than
one
in
case
of
difficulties
afterwards
i
mean
the
idea
seems
to
knock
you
out
some
stanninghame
there
was
something
in
it
laurence
reckless
unscrupulous
as
he
was
could
not
but
hesitate
in
striving
to
save
his
young
friend
from
one
form
of
ruin
was
it
written
that
he
should
plunge
him
into
another
more
irretrievable
more
sweeping
more
lifelong
i
am
thinking
he
might
give
us
trouble
he
replied
deliberately
what
if
he
sickened
of
the
whole
business
and
kicked
just
when
we
wanted
to
pull
together
the
most
no
no
hazon
if
we
take
him
at
all
we
must
send
him
back
as
i
say
it
all
very
well
for
us
two
but
it
seem
quite
the
thing
to
run
a
youngster
with
all
his
life
before
him
and
bursting
with
hopes
and
ideals
into
a
grim
business
of
this
kind
but
taking
him
or
leaving
him
rests
with
you
entirely
leave
it
that
way
then
i
think
it
over
and
see
if
it
pans
out
any
said
hazon
leisurely
lighting
a
fresh
pipe
but
stanninghame
what
this
he
added
with
a
sudden
keen
glance
out
of
his
piercing
eyes
you
are
letting
yourself
go
with
regard
to
this
matter
showing
feeling
that
wo
do
you
know
you
got
to
have
no
sample
of
that
sort
of
goods
about
you
no
more
than
can
be
put
into
a
block
of
granite
are
you
in
training
yet
well
i
think
so
or
at
any
rate
shall
be
long
before
it
is
wanted
seriously
no
more
was
said
on
the
subject
then
as
the
preparations
progressed
and
the
time
for
the
start
drew
near
it
seemed
to
laurence
stanninghame
that
more
and
more
was
the
old
life
a
mere
dream
a
dream
of
the
past
sometimes
in
his
sleep
he
would
be
back
in
it
would
see
the
dinginess
of
the
ramshackle
would
hear
the
vulgar
sounds
of
the
vulgar
suburban
street
and
he
would
turn
uneasily
in
his
dreams
with
a
depressing
consciousness
of
dust
and
discord
and
a
blank
wall
as
of
the
hopelessness
of
life
drawn
across
his
path
feeling
pooh
who
would
miss
him
out
of
the
traditional
charm
of
the
family
circle
a
new
toy
costing
an
extra
shilling
or
so
would
quite
knock
out
all
and
any
recollection
of
himself
there
were
times
when
in
his
dreams
he
had
even
returned
to
the
domestic
ark
and
in
the
result
a
day
of
welcome
and
comparative
peace
then
discord
and
jangling
strife
as
before
and
the
ever
depressing
crushing
consciousness
of
squalid
penury
for
the
rest
of
his
natural
life
from
such
visions
he
had
awakened
awakened
with
a
start
of
exultant
gratulation
to
find
the
glow
of
the
african
sun
streaming
into
the
room
every
nerve
tingling
with
a
consciousness
of
strength
and
vigour
his
mind
rejoicing
to
look
forward
into
the
boundless
possibilities
held
out
by
the
adventure
in
which
he
was
involved
that
other
ghastly
horror
which
had
haunted
him
for
so
long
now
put
far
away
risk
excitement
peril
daring
to
be
rewarded
by
wealth
after
long
years
of
unnatural
stagnation
the
prospect
opened
out
a
vista
as
of
boundless
delight
yet
was
this
dashed
dashed
by
an
impending
parting
the
certainty
of
this
would
ever
intrude
and
quench
his
exultation
sweet
lilith
how
she
had
subtilely
intertwined
herself
within
his
life
well
he
was
strong
he
could
surely
keep
himself
in
hand
it
should
be
a
part
of
his
training
still
though
the
certainty
of
impending
separation
would
quench
his
exultation
on
awakening
to
the
light
of
each
new
day
which
brought
that
parting
nearer
yet
there
was
another
certainty
that
at
least
a
portion
of
every
such
day
should
be
spent
with
her
but
even
he
with
all
his
strength
with
all
his
foresight
little
realized
what
the
actual
moment
of
that
parting
should
mean
chapter
xi
at
the
twelfth
hour
he
was
there
to
say
as
he
sat
waiting
the
soft
subdued
hush
of
the
shaded
room
in
its
cool
fragrance
struck
upon
his
senses
as
with
an
influence
of
depression
of
sadness
of
loss
he
had
come
to
bid
farewell
farewell
now
the
moment
had
arrived
he
somehow
felt
it
would
she
never
come
in
his
nerves
seemed
all
on
edge
and
ever
upon
the
glowing
midday
heat
the
jarring
thump
of
the
crown
reef
battery
beat
its
monotonous
time
then
the
door
opened
softly
and
lilith
entered
never
had
she
seemed
to
look
more
sweet
more
inviting
the
rich
dark
beauty
always
more
enthralling
more
captivating
when
warmed
by
the
constant
kiss
of
its
native
southern
sun
the
starry
eyes
wide
with
earnestness
the
sad
sweet
expression
of
the
wistful
lips
the
glorious
splendour
of
the
perfect
form
in
its
cool
creamy
white
draperies
laurence
stanninghame
gazing
upon
her
realized
with
a
dull
dead
ache
at
the
heart
that
all
his
strength
was
but
the
veriest
weakness
and
now
he
had
come
to
say
farewell
i
can
hardly
realize
that
we
shall
not
see
each
other
again
lilith
said
after
a
transparently
feeble
attempt
or
two
on
the
part
of
both
of
them
to
talk
on
indifferent
subjects
when
do
you
expect
to
return
how
long
will
you
be
away
may
be
for
years
and
it
may
be
for
ever
quoted
laurence
a
bitter
ring
in
his
tone
probably
the
latter
you
must
not
say
that
remember
what
i
told
you
more
than
once
before
i
am
always
hopeful
i
never
despair
even
when
things
look
blackest
either
for
myself
or
other
people
though
i
dare
say
you
are
laughing
to
yourself
now
at
the
idea
of
things
being
anything
but
bright
to
me
well
then
i
predict
you
will
come
back
with
what
you
want
you
will
return
rich
and
all
will
look
up
then
for
you
she
spoke
lightly
smilingly
he
listening
gazing
at
her
felt
bitter
he
had
been
mistaken
well
he
had
found
out
his
mistake
only
just
in
time
only
just
but
even
he
with
all
his
observant
perceptiveness
had
failed
to
penetrate
lilith
magnificent
let
us
hope
your
prediction
will
prove
a
true
one
he
said
falling
in
with
her
supposed
mood
the
one
thing
to
make
life
worth
living
is
wealth
i
will
stick
at
nothing
to
obtain
it
nothing
without
it
life
is
a
hell
with
it
well
life
is
at
one
feet
there
is
nothing
one
can
not
do
with
it
nothing
his
eyes
glowed
with
a
sombre
light
there
was
a
world
of
repressed
passion
in
his
tone
the
resentful
snarl
as
he
thought
of
the
past
squalor
and
bitterness
of
life
mingling
with
the
savage
determination
and
unscrupulous
recklessness
of
the
born
adventurer
there
is
one
thing
you
can
not
obtain
for
it
she
said
that
is
love
but
it
can
bring
you
all
that
will
cause
you
to
feel
no
longing
for
that
deceptive
illusion
you
can
forget
that
such
a
thing
exists
can
forget
it
in
the
renewed
exuberance
of
vitality
which
is
sheer
enjoyment
of
living
well
wish
me
luck
is
a
dreadful
word
but
it
has
to
be
said
he
had
risen
and
stood
blindly
the
shaded
room
the
sensuous
fragrance
of
her
presence
every
graceful
movement
the
fascination
of
the
wide
earnest
eyes
all
was
more
than
beginning
to
intoxicate
him
to
shatter
his
of
bitterness
and
he
the
strong
the
invulnerable
the
man
in
whom
all
heart
and
feeling
was
dead
what
sorcery
was
this
he
was
bewitched
entranced
enthralled
his
strength
was
as
water
yet
not
they
stood
facing
each
other
glance
fused
into
glance
at
that
moment
heart
seemed
opened
to
heart
to
be
gazing
therein
he
said
do
quite
forget
me
lilith
dear
think
a
little
now
and
then
of
the
times
we
have
had
together
then
their
lips
met
in
a
long
kiss
and
she
said
nothing
perhaps
she
could
not
the
of
an
awful
torrent
of
bravely
controlled
grief
may
be
opened
in
the
utterance
of
that
word
laurence
stanninghame
seemed
to
walk
blindly
staggering
in
the
strong
sunlight
was
it
the
midday
heat
or
the
strong
glare
the
beat
of
the
crown
reef
stamps
seemed
to
hammer
within
his
brain
which
seethed
and
swirled
with
the
recollection
of
that
last
long
kiss
he
would
not
look
back
impervious
to
the
heat
he
stepped
out
over
the
veldt
at
a
pace
which
by
the
time
he
reached
the
corner
of
the
wemmer
property
caused
him
to
look
up
wonderingly
that
he
should
already
be
entering
the
town
oh
there
you
are
stanninghame
sung
out
a
voice
whose
owner
nearly
cannoned
into
him
laurence
looked
up
here
i
am
as
you
say
holmes
he
answered
quite
coolly
and
unconcernedly
but
where
are
you
bound
for
and
what
the
excitement
anyway
why
i
thought
i
see
if
i
could
meet
you
hazon
said
you
had
gone
down
to
booyseus
this
morning
what
do
you
think
i
got
round
him
and
i
going
with
you
laurence
stared
then
looked
grave
going
with
us
eh
i
say
youngster
have
you
made
your
will
have
got
anything
to
leave
but
stanninghame
i
awfully
obliged
to
you
old
fellow
it
all
through
you
i
got
round
the
old
man
have
you
any
sort
of
idea
what
our
program
is
none
and
i
do
care
laurence
whistled
see
here
holmes
he
said
this
thing
has
got
to
be
looked
into
in
fact
it
ca
go
on
yes
it
can
and
it
shall
do
be
a
beast
now
stanninghame
i
go
anywhere
with
you
two
fellows
and
i
dead
off
this
waiting
for
a
boom
that
never
comes
i
shall
be
as
stony
broke
as
the
rest
of
them
if
i
hold
on
any
longer
so
i
going
to
realize
at
a
loss
and
go
with
you
come
along
now
to
phillips
bar
and
we
split
a
bottle
of
cham
to
the
undertaking
you
do
need
to
buzz
to
that
extent
holmes
i
hate
walker
is
good
enough
for
me
they
reached
phillips
and
found
that
historic
bar
far
from
empty
and
young
holmes
who
was
full
of
exhilaration
over
the
prospects
of
this
trip
was
insisting
that
many
should
drink
success
thereto
laurence
silent
amid
the
racket
of
voices
was
curiously
watching
him
this
youngster
would
he
ever
come
to
look
back
upon
life
as
a
thing
that
had
far
better
have
never
been
lived
and
he
smiled
queerly
to
himself
as
he
thought
what
would
be
the
effect
upon
holmes
of
the
experiences
he
would
bring
back
with
him
from
that
trip
to
which
he
was
looking
forward
so
joyously
so
hopefully
if
he
returned
from
it
at
all
that
was
if
indeed
any
of
them
did
but
throughout
the
racket
the
strife
of
tongues
the
boisterous
guffaw
over
some
cheap
wheeze
the
recollection
of
the
shaded
room
of
that
last
in
the
cloudless
noontide
pressed
like
a
living
weight
upon
his
heart
never
would
it
be
obliterated
never
throughout
the
afternoon
laurence
busied
himself
greatly
over
the
final
preparations
he
did
not
even
feel
tempted
to
ride
over
to
booyseus
on
some
pretext
lilith
would
not
be
alone
there
was
always
a
host
of
people
there
of
an
afternoon
callers
players
and
so
forth
the
ineffably
sweet
sadness
of
that
last
parting
must
be
the
recollection
he
was
to
carry
forth
with
him
it
was
evening
the
wagons
had
been
started
just
before
sundown
and
now
their
owners
were
riding
out
of
the
town
to
overtake
them
young
holmes
suffering
under
an
exuberance
of
exhilaration
begotten
of
multifold
effected
to
a
spirituous
accompaniment
was
not
so
firm
in
his
saddle
as
he
might
have
been
but
on
the
hardened
heads
of
the
other
two
the
effect
of
such
farewells
had
been
nil
they
were
just
getting
clear
of
the
town
when
they
became
aware
of
a
panting
puffing
native
striving
to
overtake
them
why
it
john
said
hazon
recognizing
one
of
the
coloured
waiters
at
their
hotel
the
boy
ran
straight
up
to
laurence
and
held
out
an
envelope
for
you
baas
he
said
the
baas
forgot
to
give
it
you
dank
you
baas
catching
with
a
grin
something
that
was
flung
to
him
it
was
a
envelope
and
sealed
what
new
surprise
was
this
as
he
took
in
the
puzzling
yet
characteristic
handwriting
of
the
address
i
see
you
once
more
he
read
i
can
not
let
you
go
like
this
laurence
darling
come
to
me
for
one
more
i
shall
be
alone
this
evening
come
to
me
love
of
my
heart
pho
of
course
it
was
not
it
was
too
ridiculous
it
was
not
as
if
all
heaven
had
opened
before
his
eyes
of
course
not
he
told
himself
but
it
was
by
the
way
hazon
he
said
indifferently
i
find
there
is
still
a
matter
i
have
to
attend
to
so
you
must
go
on
without
me
i
expect
overtake
you
not
long
after
sunrise
or
not
much
later
the
dark
impassive
face
of
the
man
underwent
no
change
he
had
understood
the
whole
change
of
plan
but
it
was
no
concern
of
his
so
he
merely
said
and
continued
his
way
laurence
did
not
go
back
to
the
hotel
the
last
thing
he
desired
was
that
his
return
should
be
noticed
and
commented
upon
he
sought
out
rainsford
who
having
willingly
consented
to
put
up
his
steed
and
being
a
discreet
fellow
was
not
likely
to
indulge
in
undue
then
he
took
his
way
down
to
booyseus
as
he
stepped
forth
through
the
gloom
for
by
this
time
it
was
quite
dark
the
words
of
that
missive
seemed
burned
into
his
brain
in
characters
of
fire
and
of
gold
what
words
they
were
too
he
had
read
her
glance
aright
then
it
was
only
that
intrepidity
of
which
he
had
failed
to
allow
for
and
he
why
had
he
been
so
strong
that
morning
seldom
indeed
did
a
second
opportunity
occur
but
now
when
he
should
return
up
the
hill
he
was
now
descending
such
a
memory
would
be
his
to
carry
forth
with
him
into
the
solitude
and
peril
and
privation
of
his
enterprise
yet
to
what
end
even
if
he
were
successful
in
amassing
wealth
untold
yet
they
two
must
be
as
far
apart
as
ever
well
that
need
not
follow
he
told
himself
with
wealth
one
can
do
anything
anything
without
it
nothing
was
at
this
time
the
primary
article
of
laurence
stanninghame
creed
and
at
the
thought
his
step
grew
more
elastic
and
all
unconsciously
his
head
threw
itself
back
in
a
gesture
of
anticipatory
triumph
the
house
was
quiet
as
he
approached
at
the
sound
of
his
step
on
the
almost
before
he
had
time
to
knock
the
door
was
opened
was
opened
by
lilith
herself
then
closed
behind
him
she
said
no
word
she
only
looked
up
at
him
the
subdued
light
of
the
hall
softened
as
with
an
almost
unearthly
beauty
the
upturned
face
and
forth
from
it
her
eyes
shone
glowed
with
the
lustre
of
a
radiant
tenderness
too
vast
too
overwhelming
for
her
lips
to
utter
and
he
he
too
said
no
word
those
lips
of
hers
sweet
inviting
were
pressed
to
his
that
peerless
form
was
wrapped
in
his
embrace
sinking
therein
with
a
soft
sigh
of
contentment
what
room
was
there
for
mere
words
as
again
and
again
he
kissed
the
lips
eyes
hair
then
the
lips
again
this
was
only
the
beginning
of
a
farewell
visit
a
sad
whirling
of
farewell
yet
as
the
blood
surged
boiling
through
laurence
stanninghame
veins
and
heart
pressed
against
heart
seemed
swelled
to
bursting
point
he
thought
that
life
even
such
as
it
had
been
was
worth
living
if
it
could
contain
such
a
moment
as
this
equally
too
did
he
realize
that
in
life
or
in
death
the
of
this
moment
should
illumine
his
memory
dark
though
it
might
be
for
ever
and
ever
what
did
you
think
of
me
when
you
got
my
note
dear
one
she
whispered
at
last
and
i
have
been
in
perfect
agony
ever
since
for
fear
it
should
be
too
late
but
i
could
not
let
you
go
as
i
did
this
morning
i
felt
such
an
irresistible
craving
to
see
you
again
laurence
my
darling
to
hear
your
voice
i
felt
we
could
not
part
as
we
did
each
trying
to
deceive
the
other
each
knowing
the
while
that
it
was
impossible
i
wanted
more
than
that
for
a
memory
throughout
the
blank
time
that
is
coming
yes
we
were
both
too
strong
my
lilith
and
why
should
we
have
been
what
scruple
ever
stood
anybody
to
the
good
in
this
of
a
state
called
not
one
not
one
yes
we
were
too
strong
and
your
deceived
even
me
my
ah
laurence
my
darling
how
little
you
knew
all
the
time
i
was
battling
hard
with
myself
forcing
down
an
irresistible
longing
to
do
this
and
this
and
this
and
drawing
down
his
head
she
kissed
him
again
and
again
long
tender
kisses
as
though
her
whole
soul
sought
entrance
into
his
but
i
shall
tire
you
my
dearest
if
i
keep
you
standing
here
like
this
she
went
on
come
inside
now
and
our
last
talk
our
last
for
a
long
time
shall
at
any
rate
be
a
cosey
one
she
drew
him
within
the
half
open
door
of
an
adjoining
room
the
window
curtains
were
drawn
and
a
shaded
lamp
gave
forth
the
same
subdued
and
chastened
light
as
that
which
burned
in
the
hall
there
were
flowers
in
vases
and
sprays
arranged
in
every
tasteful
and
delicate
manner
and
distilling
a
fragrance
subtile
and
pervading
the
sumptuous
prettiness
of
the
furniture
and
ornaments
picture
frames
encasing
mystic
and
subjects
books
disposed
here
and
there
delicate
embroidery
the
work
of
her
fingers
in
short
the
hundred
and
one
dainty
pleasing
to
the
eye
seemed
to
reflect
the
bright
beautiful
personality
of
lilith
for
indeed
the
arrangement
and
disposal
of
them
was
almost
entirely
her
own
she
made
him
sit
down
upon
the
softest
and
most
comfortable
couch
then
as
she
seated
herself
beside
him
he
drew
her
head
down
to
rest
upon
his
shoulder
and
wound
his
arms
about
her
why
did
you
wait
until
even
the
twelfth
hour
he
said
why
did
you
blind
me
all
this
time
my
lilith
only
think
what
we
have
lost
by
it
ah
yes
i
have
indeed
but
tell
me
dear
one
it
is
not
too
late
is
it
even
though
it
be
the
twelfth
hour
it
came
very
near
being
too
late
i
had
already
started
yes
it
is
indeed
the
twelfth
hour
too
late
i
do
know
he
went
on
in
a
tone
of
sombre
bitterness
think
of
the
blissful
times
that
might
have
been
ours
had
i
but
known
i
would
have
taught
you
the
real
meaning
of
the
word
i
would
have
drawn
your
innermost
soul
from
you
would
have
drawn
it
into
mine
have
twined
every
thought
of
your
being
around
mine
had
i
but
known
and
i
could
have
done
this
you
know
i
could
do
you
not
think
a
moment
then
answer
the
head
which
rested
on
his
shoulder
seemed
to
lean
heavier
there
the
arm
which
encircled
her
was
pressed
tighter
by
hers
to
the
round
beautiful
waist
as
though
to
bring
herself
closer
within
his
embrace
the
answer
came
rapturously
sweet
but
with
a
thrill
of
pain
i
know
you
could
have
there
is
no
need
to
think
even
for
a
moment
you
have
done
it
i
have
tried
to
even
against
difficulties
come
what
may
lilith
you
shall
never
be
free
from
the
spell
of
this
love
of
ours
all
thoughts
of
other
love
shall
be
flat
and
stale
and
dead
and
now
when
i
am
gone
your
whole
soul
shall
ache
and
throb
with
a
sense
of
loss
love
and
pain
intertwined
yet
not
one
pang
of
the
latter
would
you
forego
lest
it
should
lessen
the
rapturous
keenness
of
the
former
in
the
minutest
degree
this
is
what
you
have
caused
to
suffer
by
reason
of
your
stony
up
till
this
morning
now
you
shall
suffer
it
too
his
tones
were
calm
even
almost
stern
as
those
of
a
judge
pronouncing
sentence
lilith
drinking
in
every
word
felt
already
that
every
word
was
true
that
sense
of
love
and
pain
was
already
in
possession
of
her
soul
and
would
retain
possession
until
all
capacity
for
feeling
was
dulled
and
dead
you
were
cruel
to
draw
my
very
soul
out
of
me
as
you
have
done
to
force
me
to
love
you
as
i
do
she
answered
cruel
and
pitiless
what
then
i
was
but
carrying
out
the
program
of
life
it
is
that
way
but
tell
me
would
you
have
preferred
that
i
had
not
done
it
that
i
had
passed
by
on
the
other
side
oh
my
laurence
no
no
no
ten
thousand
times
no
the
mere
recollection
of
such
an
hour
as
this
is
worth
a
of
the
awful
pain
of
loss
of
which
you
speak
and
which
is
around
me
already
that
was
my
own
judgment
when
i
first
recognized
that
a
strong
mutual
was
bringing
us
together
i
foresaw
this
moment
and
deliberately
acquiesced
in
fate
now
the
soft
waves
of
her
hair
swept
his
face
now
the
satin
smoothness
of
her
cheek
lay
against
his
lips
met
lips
again
and
again
and
never
for
a
moment
did
the
clasp
of
that
firm
embrace
relax
the
dead
blank
hopelessness
of
life
and
its
conditions
then
had
still
contained
this
had
culminated
in
this
as
he
thus
held
her
to
him
as
though
he
would
hold
her
forever
some
dreamy
seemed
to
carry
laurence
mind
into
the
dim
and
somewhat
awesome
vistas
of
the
future
to
bring
it
face
to
face
with
death
in
varying
and
appalling
forms
what
mattered
the
recollection
of
this
farewell
hour
here
in
the
room
with
its
subtile
fragrance
of
flowers
and
mysterious
light
would
be
with
him
then
such
an
hour
as
this
would
be
a
crowning
triumph
to
the
apex
of
life
better
that
life
should
end
than
lengthen
out
to
witness
a
decline
from
this
apex
as
lilith
had
said
he
was
cruel
and
pitiless
in
his
love
what
then
it
was
characteristic
of
him
had
not
all
experience
taught
him
that
the
slightest
weakness
the
slightest
compunction
was
that
faulty
link
which
should
snap
the
chain
be
the
latter
never
so
massively
forged
he
remembered
how
they
had
held
discussion
as
to
whether
right
might
ensue
from
what
was
wrong
in
the
abstract
he
remembered
the
cold
hard
imprint
of
the
against
his
forehead
the
increasing
pressure
of
his
thumb
upon
the
trigger
then
the
thought
of
love
had
come
in
as
a
hand
stretched
forth
to
snatch
him
from
the
jaws
of
death
and
it
had
so
snatched
him
what
were
the
mere
conventional
rules
of
abstract
right
or
wrong
beside
such
an
instance
of
cause
and
effect
old
wives
fables
they
were
standing
up
face
to
face
looking
into
each
other
eyes
the
hour
was
late
now
any
moment
the
household
might
return
both
desired
that
the
last
farewell
should
take
place
alone
not
for
the
sake
of
a
few
more
precious
moments
would
they
run
the
risk
of
being
cheated
out
of
that
last
farewell
you
sweet
cruel
pitiless
torturer
lilith
said
locking
her
hands
in
his
as
they
rose
you
have
placed
my
life
under
one
great
lasting
shadow
because
of
the
recollection
of
you
how
will
it
be
think
you
when
i
wake
up
and
find
you
are
gone
if
i
sleep
at
all
that
is
how
will
it
be
when
day
after
day
week
after
week
ah
love
love
she
broke
off
and
yet
i
can
not
say
did
you
do
it
for
your
very
cruelty
in
doing
it
is
sweet
sweet
do
you
hear
laurence
have
you
ever
been
loved
tell
me
have
you
have
you
she
went
on
drawing
his
head
down
with
a
sort
of
fierceness
and
again
pressing
her
burning
lips
to
his
at
the
twelfth
hour
at
the
twelfth
hour
he
repeated
in
a
kind
of
condemnatory
merciless
tone
while
his
clasp
tightened
around
the
lovely
form
which
seemed
literally
to
hang
in
his
arms
love
of
my
heart
think
what
such
an
hour
as
this
might
have
been
not
once
but
again
and
again
and
that
undashed
with
the
pain
of
immediate
parting
as
now
why
did
we
why
did
you
wait
until
the
very
twelfth
hour
why
why
indeed
darling
darling
do
reproach
me
you
have
drawn
my
very
heart
and
soul
into
yours
think
of
it
ever
day
and
night
whatever
may
befall
you
oh
laurence
my
heart
life
now
this
hard
stony
stoic
discovered
that
his
granite
nature
was
shaken
to
its
foundation
but
even
then
the
unutterable
sweetness
of
the
thought
that
he
and
he
alone
had
lived
to
inspire
the
anguish
of
the
pleading
tones
that
thrilled
to
his
ear
thrilled
with
love
for
him
to
enkindle
the
light
that
shone
from
those
eyes
melting
with
love
for
him
this
thought
flowed
in
upon
the
of
his
pain
rendering
it
bliss
yet
lashing
it
up
the
more
fiercely
there
was
silence
for
a
few
moments
both
stood
gazing
into
each
eyes
gazing
as
it
were
into
the
innermost
depths
of
each
soul
then
the
sound
of
voices
drawing
nearer
rising
above
the
clanking
hum
of
the
crown
reef
battery
seemed
to
warn
them
that
if
their
last
farewell
was
to
be
made
alone
the
time
to
make
it
had
come
now
love
of
my
heart
he
whispered
between
long
burning
clinging
kisses
now
that
this
final
parting
had
come
the
dead
dreary
heartsick
pain
of
it
seemed
to
choke
all
utterance
she
strained
him
to
her
and
heart
throbbed
against
heart
even
now
she
seemed
to
see
his
face
mistily
and
far
away
oh
it
is
too
bitter
she
gasped
striving
to
drown
her
rising
sobs
laurence
my
darling
oh
my
love
my
life
my
ideal
yes
you
were
that
from
the
moment
i
first
saw
you
and
he
was
gone
it
was
as
though
their
embrace
had
literally
been
wrenched
asunder
he
was
gone
and
even
as
he
passed
from
her
vision
from
the
light
into
the
gloom
so
it
seemed
as
though
he
had
borne
the
light
of
her
life
with
him
and
as
lilith
stood
there
in
the
open
doorway
gazing
forth
into
the
night
the
dull
measured
clank
of
the
battery
stamps
seemed
to
beat
in
cruel
pitiless
refrain
within
her
heart
at
the
twelfth
hour
at
the
twelfth
hour
chapter
xii
the
dark
places
of
the
earth
the
sun
is
setting
above
the
tropical
forest
hot
and
red
and
smoky
his
fiery
ball
imparting
something
of
a
coppery
molten
hue
to
the
vast
seas
of
luxuriant
verdure
rolling
with
scarce
a
break
on
all
sides
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
but
beneath
in
the
dim
shade
where
the
air
is
choked
by
rotting
undergrowth
and
tangled
vegetation
the
now
slanting
rays
are
powerless
to
penetrate
powerless
to
dispel
the
steamy
miasmic
exhalations
silence
too
is
the
rule
in
that
save
for
here
and
there
the
chirp
of
a
bird
far
up
among
the
or
the
stealthy
rustle
beneath
as
some
serpent
or
huge
venomous
insect
moves
upon
its
way
for
among
the
decayed
wood
of
fallen
tree
trunks
and
dry
lichens
and
hoary
mosses
growing
therefrom
do
such
delight
to
dwell
beautiful
as
this
shaded
solitude
is
with
its
vistas
of
massive
and
sombre
foliage
the
latter
here
and
there
relieved
by
clusters
of
blossoms
there
is
withal
an
awesomeness
about
its
beauty
even
the
surroundings
will
soon
begin
to
take
on
shape
and
the
boles
and
tossing
boughs
and
naked
dead
and
broken
fragments
starting
from
the
dank
soil
assume
form
attitude
countenance
in
a
hundred
divers
contortions
grotesque
diabolical
strange
too
if
the
wayfarer
threading
the
steamy
mazes
of
these
unending
glades
does
not
soon
think
to
hear
ghostly
whisperings
in
the
awed
silence
of
the
air
does
not
conjure
up
unseen
eyes
marking
his
every
step
for
the
hot
moist
depression
is
such
as
to
weigh
alike
upon
nerve
and
brain
and
now
through
the
sombre
vistas
of
this
solitude
faint
and
far
comes
a
strange
sound
a
low
vibrating
booming
hum
above
which
now
and
again
arises
a
shrill
wail
the
effect
is
indescribably
gruesome
and
eerie
in
fact
even
if
human
for
there
is
an
indefinable
something
in
sight
and
sound
and
surrounding
calculated
to
tell
if
telling
were
needed
that
this
is
indeed
one
of
the
dark
places
of
the
earth
but
if
the
sinking
beams
of
the
orb
of
light
fail
to
penetrate
this
foliage
and
enshrouded
gloom
they
slant
hot
and
red
upon
an
open
space
and
that
which
this
space
contains
inclosed
within
an
irregular
stockade
stand
the
huts
of
a
native
village
the
noise
which
penetrated
in
faint
eerie
murmur
to
yon
distant
forest
shades
is
here
terrific
the
booming
of
drums
the
cavernous
bellowing
of
the
native
horns
drowning
rather
than
supporting
the
shrill
yelling
chorus
of
the
singers
for
a
great
dance
is
proceeding
immediately
within
the
principal
gate
of
the
stockade
is
a
large
open
space
and
in
this
the
dancers
are
performing
in
a
half
circle
in
the
background
sit
a
number
of
women
and
children
aiding
with
shrill
nasal
voices
the
efforts
of
the
musicians
the
dancers
to
the
number
of
about
a
hundred
seem
to
represent
the
warrior
strength
of
the
place
they
are
savages
enough
with
their
cicatrized
and
tattooed
faces
and
wool
red
with
grease
and
ochre
and
plaited
into
tags
standing
out
like
horns
from
their
heads
giving
them
a
frightfully
demoniacal
aspect
as
they
whirl
and
leap
brandishing
spears
and
axes
and
going
through
the
pantomime
of
slaying
an
enemy
they
are
of
fair
physique
though
tall
and
gaunt
rather
than
sturdy
of
build
and
is
it
a
mere
accident
or
in
accordance
with
some
custom
not
one
there
present
whether
among
the
truculent
crew
executing
the
dance
or
among
the
women
in
the
background
appears
to
have
attained
old
age
the
whole
scene
is
sufficiently
repulsive
even
terrifying
to
come
upon
suddenly
from
the
silent
heart
of
the
dark
repellent
forest
but
there
is
yet
another
setting
to
the
picture
which
shall
render
it
complete
in
every
hideous
and
horrifying
detail
for
the
principal
gate
itself
is
decorated
with
a
complete
archway
of
human
heads
heads
in
every
stage
of
horror
and
decay
from
the
white
bleached
skull
grinning
dolefully
to
the
bloated
features
of
that
but
lately
severed
scowling
outward
with
an
awful
expression
of
terror
and
agony
and
hate
an
archway
of
them
arranged
in
some
grim
approach
to
regularity
or
taste
this
dreadful
gate
is
indeed
a
fitting
entrance
to
a
devil
abode
and
now
as
the
red
fiery
rays
of
the
sinking
sun
play
full
upon
it
the
tortured
features
seem
to
move
and
pucker
as
though
blasted
with
the
flame
of
satanic
fires
a
crow
withdrawing
his
beak
from
the
sightless
of
one
of
the
skulls
soars
upward
black
and
uttering
a
weird
raucous
croak
but
as
the
sun
touches
the
sky
line
the
dance
suddenly
ceases
in
wild
hubbub
the
fighting
men
stream
out
of
the
stockade
through
the
awful
archway
of
heads
they
are
followed
by
women
bearing
baskets
and
great
knives
all
are
in
high
spirits
chattering
and
laughing
among
each
other
the
forest
on
this
side
grows
almost
to
the
gate
just
where
its
shade
begins
the
crowd
halts
clustering
eagerly
around
two
trees
which
stand
a
little
apart
from
the
rest
but
from
one
to
the
other
of
these
two
trees
is
lashed
a
stout
beam
such
as
butchers
might
use
for
hoisting
the
carcass
of
a
slain
bullock
and
look
below
are
oblong
slabs
of
massive
wood
and
upon
them
is
blood
this
is
the
place
then
and
these
warriors
are
about
to
slaughter
the
material
for
a
feast
now
there
is
more
chatter
and
hubbub
and
all
faces
are
turned
towards
the
grim
gate
are
turned
expectantly
for
the
cattle
awaited
then
a
shout
an
exclamation
goes
up
the
material
for
the
feast
is
drawing
near
the
material
for
the
feast
heavens
no
cattle
this
but
human
beings
bound
trussed
helpless
five
human
bodies
are
borne
along
by
their
head
and
heels
and
flung
down
anyhow
at
the
place
of
slaughter
the
eyeballs
of
the
victims
are
starting
from
their
heads
with
terror
and
despair
as
their
glance
falls
upon
the
grisly
instruments
of
death
yet
no
surprise
is
there
for
they
have
seen
it
all
before
three
of
the
five
are
old
men
these
are
seized
first
and
a
thong
being
made
fast
to
their
ankles
they
are
hauled
up
to
the
beam
where
hanging
head
downwards
they
are
butchered
like
calves
and
those
who
are
most
active
in
at
any
rate
preparing
them
for
the
slaughter
are
their
own
children
own
these
go
about
their
work
without
one
spark
of
pity
one
qualm
of
ruth
will
not
their
own
turn
come
in
the
course
of
years
should
they
not
be
slain
in
battle
or
the
chase
in
the
interim
of
course
why
then
heed
such
vain
sentiment
it
is
the
custom
old
and
useless
people
are
not
kept
among
this
tribe
the
other
two
who
are
not
old
but
prisoners
of
war
suffer
in
like
manner
and
then
all
five
of
the
bodies
are
flung
on
to
the
blocks
and
quartered
and
disjointed
with
astonishing
celerity
and
women
bearing
the
oblong
baskets
return
within
the
stockade
passing
through
the
hideous
gateway
staggering
beneath
the
weight
of
limbs
and
trunks
of
their
slaughtered
within
the
open
space
great
fires
now
leap
and
crackle
into
life
roaring
upward
upon
the
still
air
reddening
as
with
a
this
hellish
scene
and
gathering
around
the
savages
impatiently
and
with
hungry
eyes
watch
the
cooking
of
the
disjointed
members
and
hardly
able
to
restrain
their
impatience
snatch
their
horrible
roast
from
the
flames
and
embers
before
it
is
much
more
than
warmed
through
and
with
laugh
and
shout
the
cannibal
orgy
goes
on
prolonged
far
into
the
night
the
bones
and
refuse
being
flung
to
the
women
in
the
background
at
last
surfeited
with
their
frightful
feast
these
demons
in
human
shape
drop
down
and
sleep
like
brute
beasts
and
the
full
moon
soaring
high
in
the
heavens
looks
down
with
a
gibing
sneer
in
her
cold
cruel
face
upon
this
scene
of
a
shocking
human
shambles
and
her
light
so
far
from
irradiating
this
dark
place
of
the
earth
seems
but
to
shed
a
livid
sulphurous
glare
upon
a
very
antechamber
of
hell
the
moon
floats
higher
and
higher
above
the
tropical
forest
flooding
the
seas
of
slumbering
foliage
with
silver
light
hour
follows
upon
hour
and
in
the
stockaded
village
all
is
silent
as
with
the
stillness
of
death
the
ghastly
remnants
of
that
fearful
feast
lie
around
in
the
moonbeams
human
bones
picked
clean
yet
expressive
in
their
shape
spectral
as
though
they
would
fain
reunite
and
return
to
drain
the
of
these
human
wolves
who
devour
their
own
kind
but
the
sleep
of
the
latter
is
calm
peaceful
secure
secure
wait
what
are
these
stealthy
forms
rising
noiselessly
among
the
undergrowth
on
the
outskirts
of
the
clearing
are
they
ghosts
ghosts
of
those
thus
barbarously
slain
and
of
many
others
before
them
the
moonlit
sward
is
alive
with
flitting
shapes
gliding
towards
the
stockade
surrounding
it
on
all
sides
with
a
celerity
and
fixity
of
purpose
which
can
have
but
one
meaning
and
among
them
is
the
glint
of
metal
the
shining
of
rifle
barrels
and
spear
blades
the
inhabitants
of
that
village
are
savages
and
thus
for
all
their
state
of
heavy
slumber
are
instinctively
on
the
alert
they
wake
and
rush
forth
with
wild
yells
of
alarm
of
warning
but
to
many
of
them
it
is
the
last
sound
they
shall
utter
for
numberless
forms
are
already
swarming
over
the
stockade
and
now
the
stillness
is
rent
by
the
roar
of
firearms
dark
ferocious
faces
grin
with
exultation
as
the
inhabitants
decimated
by
that
deadly
volley
turn
wildly
in
headlong
flight
for
the
only
side
of
the
stockade
apparently
left
open
but
before
these
arises
another
mass
of
assailants
barring
their
way
then
springing
upon
them
spear
in
hand
and
the
fiendish
screeches
its
strident
chorus
as
the
broad
spears
shear
down
through
flesh
and
muscle
and
the
earth
is
slippery
with
blood
ghastly
with
writhing
and
disemboweled
corpses
if
this
nest
of
was
hellish
before
in
its
bloodstained
horror
words
fail
to
describe
its
aspect
now
the
savage
shouts
of
the
assailants
the
despairing
screeches
of
women
and
children
who
have
come
forth
only
to
find
all
escape
cut
off
the
gasping
groans
of
the
wounded
and
of
the
slain
the
gaping
gashes
and
staggering
forms
and
ever
around
grim
countenances
with
teeth
bared
and
a
perfect
hell
of
gleaming
from
distended
eyeballs
all
is
but
another
too
common
here
in
the
dark
places
of
the
earth
it
seems
that
in
a
very
few
minutes
not
a
living
being
in
that
surprised
village
will
be
left
alive
but
now
voices
are
raised
in
remonstrance
in
command
loud
voices
authoritative
voices
ordering
a
cessation
of
the
massacre
for
this
is
no
expedition
of
vengeance
but
a
party
in
swahili
and
zulu
the
leaders
strive
to
curb
this
once
let
loose
among
their
followers
but
the
savage
wangoni
who
are
the
speakers
of
the
latter
tongue
and
who
constitute
about
half
the
attacking
party
have
tasted
slaughter
and
their
ferocity
is
beyond
control
indeed
but
for
the
fact
of
being
allowed
to
massacre
a
proportion
of
the
inhabitants
of
each
place
attacked
they
could
not
be
enlisted
for
such
a
purpose
at
all
still
their
broad
spears
flash
in
the
moonlight
and
all
who
are
in
the
way
feel
them
combatants
shrieking
women
paralyzed
crouching
children
and
not
until
the
leader
has
threatened
to
turn
his
rifles
upon
them
will
these
ferocious
auxiliaries
be
persuaded
to
desist
and
then
only
sullenly
and
growling
like
a
pack
of
disappointed
wolves
fully
of
the
male
inhabitants
have
been
slain
and
not
a
few
women
and
children
and
now
as
the
heavy
sulphurous
fumes
of
powder
smoke
roll
forth
on
the
still
solemn
beauty
of
the
night
and
the
wangoni
reluctantly
quitting
the
congenial
work
of
plunder
and
rapine
drive
into
open
space
every
living
being
they
can
muster
the
two
leaders
step
forward
and
with
critical
decision
inspect
the
extent
and
quality
of
their
capture
of
the
latter
there
are
none
but
for
the
sufficiently
hideous
reason
already
set
forth
these
are
drafted
into
gangs
according
to
age
or
sex
and
yoked
together
like
oxen
with
heavy
wooden
yokes
upon
the
whole
of
this
wild
scene
of
carnage
and
massacre
the
principal
leader
of
the
has
gazed
unmoved
not
a
shot
has
he
fired
not
deeming
it
necessary
so
complete
was
the
panic
wherewith
the
cannibal
village
was
overwhelmed
rather
have
his
energies
been
devoted
to
restraining
the
of
his
ferocious
followers
for
he
looks
upon
the
tragedy
with
a
cold
commercial
eye
prisoners
represent
so
many
saleable
wares
if
it
is
essential
that
his
shall
taste
a
modicum
of
blood
or
their
appetite
for
that
species
of
quarry
would
be
gone
it
is
his
business
to
see
that
they
destroy
no
more
property
than
can
be
avoided
the
force
is
made
up
of
swahili
and
negroid
arabs
and
a
strong
contingent
of
wangoni
a
tribe
turbulent
warlike
and
to
whom
such
a
maraud
as
this
comes
as
the
most
congenial
occupation
in
the
world
the
savages
are
still
looking
through
the
reed
huts
in
search
of
food
arms
anything
portable
if
during
their
quest
they
happen
upon
a
terrified
fugitive
hoping
for
concealment
their
delight
knows
no
bounds
for
have
they
not
the
enjoyment
of
privily
spearing
such
away
from
their
leader
eye
the
said
leader
now
gives
the
word
to
march
and
as
the
moonlight
pales
into
the
first
grays
of
dawn
the
scene
of
the
massacre
becomes
plain
in
all
its
appalling
detail
corpses
ripped
and
slashed
lying
around
in
every
contorted
attitude
among
broken
weapons
and
strewn
about
articles
of
clothing
or
furniture
everywhere
blood
the
ground
is
slippery
with
it
the
huts
are
splashed
with
it
the
persons
and
weapons
of
the
raiders
are
all
horrid
with
it
and
in
the
midst
that
band
of
men
and
women
yoked
like
cattle
and
with
the
same
hopeless
stolid
expression
now
upon
their
countenances
yet
they
are
not
dejected
their
lives
have
been
spared
where
others
have
been
slain
but
they
are
slaves
bid
farewell
to
home
o
foul
and
evil
dogs
who
devour
each
other
jeer
the
savage
wangoni
as
these
are
driven
forth
ye
shall
keep
each
other
in
meat
on
the
way
ha
ha
for
in
truth
ye
are
as
fat
oxen
to
each
other
pointing
with
their
broad
spears
to
the
gruesome
trees
and
crossbeam
the
scene
of
the
hideous
cannibal
slaughter
for
the
wangoni
by
virtue
of
their
zulu
origin
hold
cannibalism
in
the
deepest
horror
and
aversion
these
barbarians
now
humming
a
bass
as
they
march
are
in
high
glee
for
there
are
more
villages
to
raid
and
as
the
whole
party
moves
forth
from
the
glade
once
more
to
plunge
within
the
forest
gloom
the
air
is
alive
with
the
circling
of
carrion
birds
and
the
newly
risen
sun
darts
his
first
arrowy
beam
upon
the
scene
of
horror
lighting
up
the
red
gore
and
the
slain
corpses
and
the
ghastly
staring
heads
upon
the
gateway
even
as
his
last
ray
fell
upon
a
tragedy
of
blood
and
of
cruelty
so
now
does
his
first
for
in
truth
this
is
one
of
the
dark
places
of
the
earth
chapter
xiii
the
man
hunters
for
some
three
hours
the
party
moves
forward
through
the
forest
shades
then
a
halt
is
called
and
sentinels
having
been
posted
soon
the
smoke
of
bivouac
fires
ascends
and
the
clatter
of
cooking
utensils
mingles
with
the
hum
of
many
voices
the
place
selected
is
an
open
glade
or
clearing
overhung
on
one
side
by
hoary
masses
of
rock
the
as
we
have
said
are
divided
into
two
sections
one
consisting
of
negroid
arabs
and
believers
in
the
prophet
mostly
and
clad
in
array
once
gaudy
but
now
soiled
and
tarnished
some
few
however
wearing
the
white
haik
and
burnous
the
other
of
wangoni
stalwart
martial
savages
believers
in
nothing
and
clad
in
not
much
more
these
form
camps
apart
for
at
heart
each
section
despises
the
other
though
for
purposes
of
temporarily
welded
a
few
but
very
few
are
arabs
of
pure
blood
one
of
these
is
now
engaged
in
converse
with
the
leader
of
the
party
he
is
a
tall
dignified
man
with
eyes
as
piercing
as
those
of
a
hawk
and
his
speech
is
sparing
but
if
his
words
are
few
his
deeds
are
many
and
the
name
of
lutali
which
however
he
makes
no
secret
is
not
his
real
name
is
known
and
feared
at
least
as
far
and
as
thoroughly
as
that
of
the
chief
of
the
slavers
himself
for
the
latter
one
glance
at
him
is
sufficient
to
show
that
if
ever
man
was
born
to
rule
with
firm
but
judicious
hand
such
a
gang
of
bloodthirsty
freebooters
it
is
this
one
the
vigour
of
his
powerful
frame
is
apparent
with
every
movement
and
the
strength
and
fixity
of
will
expressed
in
his
keen
dark
face
there
is
no
mistaking
but
the
black
piercing
eyes
and
bronzed
features
belong
to
no
arab
no
half
caste
he
is
a
white
man
a
european
stay
to
be
accurate
there
is
just
a
strain
of
arab
in
him
faint
indeed
as
of
several
generations
intervening
yet
real
enough
to
qualify
him
for
mysterious
rites
of
blood
brotherhood
with
some
of
the
most
powerful
chiefs
from
tanganyika
to
khartoum
and
throughout
the
congo
territory
and
many
an
equatorial
tribe
beyond
this
man
name
has
been
known
and
feared
no
leader
of
can
come
near
him
for
bold
and
raids
the
terror
and
unexpectedness
of
which
together
with
the
complete
and
ruthless
fixity
of
purpose
wherewith
the
objects
of
them
however
strong
however
alert
are
struck
and
promptly
subjugated
have
gained
for
him
among
his
followers
and
allies
the
sobriquet
of
el
khanac
the
strangler
but
the
reader
together
with
johannesburg
at
large
knows
him
under
another
name
and
that
is
pirate
hazon
is
it
prudent
think
you
lutali
he
is
saying
consider
these
wajalu
are
a
trifle
too
near
the
land
of
the
indeed
we
ourselves
are
too
near
it
now
and
a
day
journey
or
more
in
the
same
direction
is
it
not
to
run
our
heads
into
the
jaws
of
the
lion
allah
is
great
my
brother
replies
the
arab
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
but
i
would
ask
what
have
we
in
our
numbers
and
with
arms
such
as
these
gripping
significantly
his
express
rifle
to
fear
from
those
armed
with
spears
and
shields
yea
even
the
whole
nation
of
them
yet
i
have
seen
an
army
of
the
nation
of
which
those
are
sprung
armed
only
with
spears
and
shields
eat
up
a
force
three
times
as
large
as
our
own
and
infinitely
better
armed
i
being
one
of
the
few
who
escaped
and
people
of
the
can
not
from
all
accounts
be
inferior
to
the
stock
whence
they
came
lutali
shrugs
his
shoulders
again
it
may
be
so
he
says
yet
there
is
a
large
village
of
these
wajalu
which
would
prove
an
easy
capture
and
would
complete
the
number
we
need
then
let
us
chance
it
is
hazon
rejoinder
the
arab
makes
a
murmur
of
assent
and
stalks
away
to
his
own
people
while
hazon
returns
to
where
he
has
left
his
white
colleague
well
holmes
according
to
lutali
they
are
bent
on
risking
it
he
begins
throwing
himself
upon
a
rug
and
proceeding
to
fill
a
pipe
are
they
i
not
altogether
glad
yet
if
it
tends
towards
hurrying
us
out
of
this
butchery
line
of
business
i
not
altogether
sorry
i
think
i
hate
it
more
and
more
every
day
it
is
a
bad
line
of
business
holmes
returns
hazon
completely
ignoring
the
smothered
reproachfulness
resentment
even
underlying
the
tone
and
reply
come
now
you
made
a
goodish
bit
of
money
the
short
time
you
have
been
at
it
anyhow
i
want
to
know
in
what
other
you
would
have
made
anything
like
as
much
in
the
time
not
in
fooling
with
those
rotten
swindling
stocks
at
the
rand
for
instance
maybe
not
but
we
have
realized
yet
in
other
words
we
are
not
safe
out
of
the
wood
yet
hazon
and
so
it
too
soon
to
hulloa
i
believe
we
are
going
to
get
off
so
easily
he
adds
are
you
going
to
get
on
your
croaking
horse
again
and
threaten
us
with
and
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
rejoins
the
other
with
a
laugh
why
man
we
are
philanthropists
real
philanthropists
and
i
never
heard
of
and
being
showered
upon
such
philanthropists
are
we
that
a
good
idea
but
where
by
the
way
does
the
philanthropy
come
in
why
just
here
then
impressively
listen
now
holmes
carry
your
mind
back
to
all
the
sights
you
have
seen
since
we
came
up
the
lualaba
until
now
have
you
forgotten
that
round
dozen
of
niggers
we
happened
on
buried
in
the
ground
up
to
their
necks
and
when
we
had
dug
up
one
fellow
we
found
we
had
taken
a
lot
of
trouble
for
nothing
because
got
his
arms
and
legs
broken
the
same
held
good
of
all
the
others
except
that
some
were
mutilated
as
well
you
remember
how
sick
it
made
you
coming
upon
those
heads
in
the
half
darkness
or
those
quarters
of
a
human
body
swinging
from
branches
to
which
their
owner
had
been
spliced
so
that
in
springing
back
the
boughs
should
drag
him
asunder
as
in
fact
they
did
or
the
sight
of
people
feeding
on
the
flesh
of
their
own
blood
relations
and
many
and
many
another
spectacle
no
more
amusing
well
then
these
barbarities
were
practised
by
no
wicked
mind
but
by
the
harmless
people
upon
each
other
and
they
are
of
occurrence
well
then
in
capturing
these
gentle
souls
and
deporting
them
for
a
price
whither
they
will
perforce
be
taught
better
manners
we
are
acting
the
part
of
real
philanthropists
do
you
catch
on
what
of
those
we
kill
those
wangoni
brutes
are
never
happy
unless
killing
that
is
inevitable
and
is
the
law
of
life
which
is
always
hard
and
as
lutali
would
say
who
may
fight
against
his
destiny
not
that
i
mean
to
say
we
embarked
in
this
business
from
motives
of
philanthropy
friend
holmes
i
only
cite
the
argument
as
one
to
quiet
that
singularly
inconvenient
conscience
of
yours
we
did
so
stanninghame
and
i
at
any
rate
to
make
money
quickly
and
plenty
of
it
and
i
not
sure
stanninghame
does
need
it
more
than
you
and
i
put
together
i
wonder
what
on
earth
has
become
of
stanninghame
all
this
time
said
holmes
apparently
glad
to
quit
an
unprofitable
subject
so
do
i
he
ought
to
have
joined
us
by
now
he
is
just
a
trifle
foolhardy
is
stanninghame
in
knocking
about
so
far
afield
alone
and
a
shade
of
anxiety
steals
over
the
speaker
face
holmes
makes
no
reply
and
for
a
while
lies
back
on
his
rug
puffing
away
at
his
pipe
and
busy
with
his
thoughts
these
are
not
altogether
pleasant
the
process
which
had
transformed
the
fine
young
englishman
into
a
the
confederate
of
ruthless
and
desperadoes
had
in
truth
been
such
as
to
engender
the
reverse
of
pleasant
thoughts
yet
that
he
had
come
to
this
was
rather
the
fault
of
circumstances
than
the
fault
of
holmes
he
had
enjoyed
the
big
game
shooting
and
the
ivory
trading
of
the
earlier
stage
of
the
trip
the
more
so
from
the
consciousness
that
there
was
profit
in
both
and
when
a
large
caravan
of
the
above
and
other
legitimate
merchandise
had
been
run
down
to
the
coast
he
had
steadfastly
refused
to
take
the
opportunity
of
parting
company
with
the
others
then
when
they
had
pushed
farther
into
the
equatorial
regions
and
joining
with
lutali
had
embarked
on
their
present
enterprise
all
opportunity
of
withdrawing
had
gone
the
precise
point
at
which
he
had
cast
in
his
lot
with
this
holmes
could
not
with
certainty
define
yet
there
were
times
when
he
thought
he
could
he
had
relieved
his
conscience
with
indignant
passionate
protest
when
first
his
eyes
became
fairly
opened
to
the
real
nature
of
the
enterprise
and
then
had
supervened
that
terrible
bout
of
malarial
fever
his
tardy
recovery
from
which
he
owed
entirely
to
the
care
and
nursing
of
both
hazon
and
stanninghame
but
it
left
him
for
a
long
time
weakened
in
mind
and
will
no
less
than
in
body
and
what
could
he
do
but
succumb
to
the
inevitable
yet
he
had
never
entered
into
the
sinister
undertaking
with
the
of
his
two
conscienceless
confederates
and
of
this
the
latter
were
aware
however
of
his
scruples
they
were
tolerant
enough
he
was
brimful
of
pluck
and
seemed
to
enjoy
the
situation
when
they
were
attacked
by
overwhelming
odds
and
had
to
fight
hard
and
fiercely
such
as
befell
more
than
once
and
they
would
insidiously
lay
salve
to
his
misgivings
by
such
arguments
as
we
have
just
heard
hazon
adduce
or
by
reminding
him
of
the
fortune
they
were
making
or
even
of
the
physical
advantage
he
was
deriving
from
the
trip
the
latter
indeed
was
a
fact
the
life
in
the
open
the
varying
climates
frequent
and
inevitable
hardships
and
peril
had
made
their
mark
upon
holmes
once
recovered
from
his
attack
he
began
to
put
on
flesh
and
muscle
and
his
eyes
were
clear
and
bright
with
that
keen
alertness
which
is
the
result
of
peril
as
a
constant
companion
in
short
as
they
said
he
looked
twice
the
man
he
had
done
when
lounging
around
the
stock
exchange
or
the
liquor
bars
of
johannesburg
through
the
hot
hours
of
noontide
the
raiders
lie
at
their
ease
many
are
asleep
others
conversing
in
drowsy
tones
smoking
or
chewing
tobacco
the
wangoni
divide
their
time
about
equally
between
taking
snuff
and
jeering
at
and
teasing
the
unfortunate
captives
these
crouching
on
the
ground
relieved
during
the
halt
of
their
heavy
forked
yokes
endure
it
all
with
the
stoicism
of
the
most
practical
phase
of
humanity
the
savage
no
good
is
to
be
got
out
of
bewailing
their
lot
therefore
they
do
not
bewail
it
moreover
belonging
to
a
savage
race
and
far
from
the
highest
type
of
the
same
they
have
no
thought
of
the
future
and
are
thus
spared
the
discomfort
and
anxiety
of
speculating
as
to
what
it
may
contain
for
them
indeed
their
chief
anxiety
at
this
moment
is
that
of
food
of
which
they
would
fain
have
more
and
gaze
with
wistful
eyes
upon
their
captors
who
are
feasting
on
the
remnant
of
what
was
until
lately
their
own
property
but
the
latter
jeeringly
suggest
to
them
the
expediency
of
their
devouring
each
other
since
they
seem
to
have
a
preference
for
such
diet
then
as
the
sun
rays
abate
somewhat
in
fierceness
the
temporary
camp
is
struck
bearers
take
up
their
loads
fighters
look
to
their
arms
the
soiled
and
gaudy
finery
of
the
sons
of
the
prophet
contrasting
with
the
shining
skins
of
the
naked
wangoni
even
as
the
winchester
and
snider
rifles
and
great
and
revolvers
of
the
first
do
with
the
broad
spears
and
tufted
hide
shields
of
the
latter
and
with
the
files
of
slaves
yoked
together
in
their
heavy
wooden
forks
or
chained
only
the
whole
caravan
numbering
now
some
six
hundred
souls
moves
onward
but
in
the
mind
of
the
principal
of
the
two
white
leaders
as
he
traces
a
cipher
on
the
scene
of
their
recent
halt
and
in
that
of
the
other
who
watches
him
is
present
now
with
deepening
anxiety
the
same
thought
the
same
speculation
what
has
become
of
the
third
chapter
xiv
a
dream
under
the
shade
of
a
large
a
man
is
lying
asleep
around
the
wilderness
spreads
in
rolling
undulation
open
here
for
the
most
part
though
dotted
with
clumps
of
bush
and
trees
which
seem
to
have
become
detached
from
the
dark
line
of
forest
this
on
the
one
hand
stretches
away
into
endless
blue
on
the
other
a
broad
expanse
of
water
apparently
a
fine
river
actually
a
chain
of
lagoons
with
banks
and
here
and
there
a
low
spit
where
red
flamingoes
roost
lazily
on
one
leg
beyond
this
again
lies
an
unbroken
line
of
forest
the
man
is
arrayed
in
the
simple
costume
of
the
wilderness
a
calico
shirt
and
moleskin
trousers
protected
by
leather
leggings
a
hat
lies
under
his
head
to
which
indeed
it
serves
as
sole
pillow
he
is
heavily
armed
the
right
hand
still
grips
an
express
rifle
in
mute
suggestion
of
one
accustomed
to
slumber
in
the
midst
of
peril
a
revolver
in
a
holster
rests
beside
him
and
in
his
leathern
belt
is
a
strong
sheath
knife
now
and
again
he
moves
in
his
sleep
and
at
such
times
his
unarmed
hand
seems
instinctively
to
seek
out
something
which
is
concealed
from
view
possibly
something
which
is
suspended
round
his
neck
by
that
light
but
strong
chain
thus
hour
after
hour
rolls
over
him
as
he
slumbers
on
in
the
burning
equatorial
heat
the
sleeper
turns
again
uneasily
and
as
he
does
so
his
hand
again
seeks
the
steel
chain
just
visible
through
his
open
shirt
and
instinctively
working
down
it
closes
over
that
which
is
secured
thereto
then
as
though
the
effect
is
lulling
once
more
he
is
still
again
slumbering
easily
peacefully
the
sun
rays
slanting
now
dart
in
beneath
the
scanty
shade
of
the
and
as
they
burn
upon
the
dark
face
bronzed
and
hardened
by
climate
and
toil
the
sleeper
lips
are
moving
and
a
peculiarly
soft
and
wistful
expression
seems
to
rest
upon
the
firm
features
then
his
eyes
open
wide
for
a
moment
he
lies
staring
up
at
the
green
fronds
which
afford
shade
no
longer
then
starts
up
into
a
sitting
posture
and
simultaneous
with
the
movement
here
and
there
a
faint
circular
ripple
widens
on
the
slimy
surface
of
the
lagoon
as
each
of
those
dark
specks
representing
the
snout
of
a
basking
crocodile
vanishes
laurence
stanninghame
outward
aspect
has
undergone
some
change
since
last
we
beheld
it
now
more
than
two
years
ago
the
expression
of
the
dark
firm
face
burned
and
bronzed
by
an
equatorial
sun
heavily
bearded
too
has
become
hard
and
ruthless
and
there
is
a
quick
alertness
in
the
penetrating
glance
of
the
clear
eyes
which
tells
of
an
familiarity
with
peril
even
the
movement
of
sitting
up
of
suddenly
awakening
from
sleep
yet
being
wide
awake
in
a
moment
contains
unconsciously
more
than
a
suggestion
of
this
a
rapid
careful
look
on
all
sides
nothing
is
stirring
in
the
sultry
penetrating
heat
the
palmetto
thatch
of
clustering
huts
away
beyond
the
opposite
bank
might
contain
no
life
for
all
of
it
they
show
hardly
a
bird
twittering
in
the
reeds
but
does
so
half
heartedly
the
man
face
softens
again
taking
on
the
expression
it
wore
while
he
slept
while
he
slept
why
could
he
not
have
slept
on
forever
he
thought
his
whole
being
athrill
with
the
memory
revived
by
his
dreams
for
his
dreams
had
been
sweet
wildly
entrancingly
sweet
seldom
indeed
were
such
vouchsafed
to
him
but
when
they
were
their
effect
would
last
would
last
vividly
he
would
treasure
up
their
recollection
would
go
back
upon
it
now
slumbering
there
in
the
torrid
heat
by
the
lagoon
his
dreams
had
wafted
him
into
a
more
than
paradise
eyes
starry
with
a
radiant
had
laughed
into
his
around
his
neck
the
twining
of
arms
and
the
soft
caressing
touch
of
soothing
hands
upon
his
head
the
whisper
of
deep
burning
tremulous
into
his
ear
and
from
this
he
had
awakened
had
awakened
to
the
reality
to
the
weird
and
depressing
surroundings
of
human
life
in
its
most
cruel
and
debased
form
to
the
recollection
of
scenes
of
recurring
and
hideous
peril
of
pitiless
atrocity
which
seemed
to
render
the
burning
brassy
glare
even
as
the
glare
of
hell
and
to
the
consciousness
of
similar
scenes
now
immediately
impending
yet
the
remembrance
of
that
sleeping
vision
shut
him
in
surrounded
him
as
with
a
very
halo
sweet
fragrant
enthralling
rolling
around
his
soul
as
a
cloud
of
intoxicating
ether
upon
a
temperament
such
as
that
of
laurence
stanninghame
the
life
of
the
past
two
years
was
bound
to
tell
the
hot
african
glow
the
adventurous
life
with
peril
continually
for
a
a
familiarity
with
weird
and
shocking
deeds
an
utter
indifference
to
human
suffering
and
human
life
had
strangely
affected
his
inner
self
callous
to
the
woes
of
others
yet
high
strung
to
a
degree
his
nature
at
this
time
presented
a
stage
of
complexity
which
was
utterly
baffling
that
mesmeric
property
to
which
hazon
had
alluded
more
than
once
as
one
of
the
effects
of
the
interior
was
upon
him
too
it
seemed
as
though
he
had
somehow
passed
into
another
world
so
dulled
was
all
recollection
of
his
former
life
all
desire
to
recall
it
yet
one
memory
remained
undimmed
lilith
my
soul
he
murmured
his
eyes
wandering
over
the
brassy
glaring
expanse
of
water
and
as
though
to
annihilate
space
and
distance
lilith
my
life
it
is
time
i
looked
once
more
upon
that
dear
face
which
rendered
my
dreams
so
sweet
his
hand
still
clasping
something
within
his
breast
was
drawn
forth
that
which
hung
by
the
steel
chain
still
inclosed
within
it
a
small
flat
metal
box
it
was
oblong
in
shape
and
shutting
so
tightly
that
at
first
glance
it
was
hard
to
see
where
it
opened
at
all
but
open
it
did
for
now
he
is
holding
what
it
contains
holding
it
lovingly
almost
reverently
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
it
is
a
little
case
green
velvet
worked
with
flowers
and
in
the
center
spreading
fantastically
in
spidery
pattern
in
dark
maroon
is
a
monogram
lilith
and
in
like
manner
is
this
same
monogram
inlaid
upon
the
lid
two
tiny
portraits
it
contains
when
opened
photographic
portraits
small
yet
clear
and
delicate
as
miniatures
lilith
eyes
gaze
forth
seeming
to
shine
from
the
inanimate
cardboard
as
though
with
the
of
gladness
lilith
beautiful
form
erect
in
characteristic
attitude
the
head
slightly
thrown
back
the
sweet
lips
compressed
just
a
touch
of
sadness
in
their
serenity
as
though
dwelling
upon
the
recollection
of
that
last
parting
even
the
soft
curling
waves
of
hair
rippling
back
from
the
temples
are
lifelike
in
the
clearness
of
the
portrait
the
strong
sweet
still
enclouding
his
brain
laurence
stands
gazing
upon
these
and
his
heart
is
as
though
enwrapped
with
a
dull
tightening
pain
sorceress
and
does
the
spell
still
enthral
me
here
he
murmurs
here
and
after
all
this
time
have
you
forgotten
me
perhaps
no
that
can
not
be
and
yet
time
time
dulls
everything
time
brings
changes
perhaps
even
the
memory
of
me
is
waning
is
becoming
dulled
but
the
softening
in
the
pictured
eyes
seems
to
contradict
the
conjecture
here
in
the
hot
brassy
glare
of
the
far
wilderness
in
the
haunts
of
bloodshed
and
wrong
that
sweet
pure
image
seems
clothed
as
with
a
divinity
to
his
hungry
gaze
others
can
see
you
in
life
others
can
hear
the
music
of
your
voice
my
beloved
others
can
look
into
the
light
of
those
eyes
can
melt
to
the
radiance
of
your
smile
while
i
only
the
image
is
mine
the
tiny
oblong
of
hard
inanimate
cardboard
he
murmurs
in
a
tone
that
is
half
weariful
half
passionate
and
now
for
the
words
a
slip
of
folded
paper
occupies
the
side
of
the
little
tin
box
this
he
extracts
and
unfolds
with
a
touch
that
is
almost
reverent
and
as
his
eyes
wander
over
the
writing
his
every
faculty
of
soul
and
mind
and
being
is
concentrated
in
rapt
love
upon
each
word
for
not
every
day
will
he
suffer
his
eyes
to
rest
upon
them
lest
too
great
familiarity
with
them
should
dull
them
with
a
mechanical
nature
when
seen
so
often
they
are
kept
for
rare
occasions
and
now
his
waking
thoughts
sweet
with
the
influence
of
the
recent
dream
he
reckons
just
such
an
occasion
the
history
of
the
box
the
portraits
the
letter
was
a
strange
one
after
that
last
parting
as
laurence
was
wending
his
way
in
the
darkness
he
became
aware
that
his
breast
pocket
contained
something
which
was
not
there
before
he
drew
it
forth
it
was
small
flat
hard
oblong
by
the
light
of
successive
vestas
he
proceeded
to
investigate
and
there
in
the
flickering
glow
lilith
sweet
eyes
gazed
out
at
him
from
the
cardboard
daintily
framed
within
the
work
of
her
fingers
even
as
here
in
the
burning
glare
of
the
equatorial
sun
and
there
too
within
the
box
lay
a
folded
slip
of
paper
covered
with
her
handwriting
her
last
words
to
him
drawing
out
perpetuating
the
echo
of
her
last
spoken
ones
with
a
thrill
of
love
and
pain
he
had
stood
there
in
the
darkness
until
his
last
vesta
had
burned
out
and
then
the
letter
was
not
half
read
but
from
that
moment
the
box
and
its
contents
had
rested
upon
his
heart
day
and
night
through
scenes
of
blood
and
of
woe
through
every
conceivable
phase
of
hardship
and
starvation
and
peril
had
rested
there
as
a
charm
or
amulet
which
should
shield
him
from
harm
and
as
such
indeed
its
donor
had
intended
it
and
now
his
eyes
wandering
over
the
paper
as
though
devouring
every
word
are
nearing
the
end
does
this
come
as
a
surprise
my
darling
a
very
sweet
surprise
it
ran
i
mean
it
to
be
that
it
for
good
or
for
ill
this
love
of
ours
you
have
said
surely
for
good
keep
then
this
image
of
me
my
beloved
never
part
with
it
day
or
night
and
may
it
ever
by
the
very
strength
of
my
love
for
you
be
as
a
talisman
a
to
stand
between
you
and
all
peril
as
you
say
the
mental
image
of
me
has
already
done
how
i
can
not
see
but
it
is
enough
for
me
that
you
say
so
and
the
consciousness
that
i
should
have
been
the
means
of
averting
evil
from
you
is
sweet
unutterably
so
may
it
continue
and
strengthen
me
as
it
will
mysteriously
shield
you
while
we
are
far
apart
my
laurence
my
ideal
yes
you
are
that
the
very
moment
my
eyes
first
met
the
firm
full
gaze
of
yours
i
recognized
it
i
knew
what
you
were
and
my
heart
went
out
to
you
the
blood
surged
hotly
in
a
dark
flush
beneath
laurence
bronzed
face
as
he
pictured
the
full
force
and
passion
of
those
parting
utterances
murmured
into
his
ear
instead
of
confided
only
to
cold
inanimate
paper
then
the
demon
of
cynicism
ingrained
within
him
came
uppermost
with
hateful
and
haunting
suggestions
she
is
safe
yes
but
those
words
were
penned
more
than
two
years
ago
more
than
two
years
ago
that
is
a
long
time
for
one
in
the
full
glow
of
her
glorious
youth
more
than
two
years
ago
and
in
the
joy
and
delight
of
living
what
charm
has
the
memory
the
daily
fading
memory
of
the
absent
for
such
as
she
think
of
it
oh
fool
not
yet
free
from
the
shackles
of
the
last
illusion
think
of
circumstances
of
surroundings
of
temperament
above
all
of
such
a
temperament
as
hers
is
your
mature
knowledge
of
life
to
go
for
nothing
that
you
are
so
easily
fooled
ha
ha
thus
laughed
the
demon
voice
in
mocking
gibe
but
he
no
he
would
not
listen
he
would
stifle
it
those
words
were
the
outcome
of
one
love
the
love
of
a
lifetime
and
nothing
less
suddenly
with
multifold
splash
and
a
great
winnowing
of
wings
a
flight
of
cranes
and
egrets
arose
from
the
bank
some
little
distance
farther
down
dark
forms
were
moving
among
the
reeds
all
the
instincts
of
a
constant
familiarity
with
peril
alert
within
him
laurence
had
in
a
moment
replaced
the
case
and
its
contents
his
express
was
grasped
in
readiness
as
he
peered
forth
eagerly
from
his
place
of
concealment
he
was
the
crafty
ruthless
slaver
once
more
then
the
expression
stealthy
resolute
which
his
discovery
had
evoked
faded
giving
way
to
one
of
curiosity
as
he
saw
that
the
potential
enemies
more
or
less
redoubtable
assailants
were
merely
a
few
small
boys
wandering
along
the
bank
jabbering
as
they
strolled
suddenly
there
was
a
splash
a
smothered
cry
and
a
loud
burst
of
shrill
laughter
the
sooty
imps
were
dancing
and
capering
with
glee
gazing
at
and
chaffing
one
of
their
number
who
had
fallen
from
the
bank
high
and
perpendicular
there
into
the
water
among
the
reeds
but
almost
as
suddenly
the
cachinations
turned
to
a
sharp
yell
of
terror
and
warning
the
reeds
swayed
in
a
quivering
line
of
undulation
as
though
something
were
moving
through
them
something
swift
and
mighty
and
terrible
and
so
it
was
the
black
boy
who
could
swim
like
a
fish
had
thrown
himself
clear
of
the
reeds
deeming
his
chances
better
in
the
open
water
but
after
him
its
long
grisly
snout
and
cruel
beady
eyes
flush
with
the
surface
glided
a
large
crocodile
half
instinctively
the
unseen
spectator
put
up
his
piece
then
dropped
it
again
he
might
shoot
the
reptile
but
what
then
all
their
plans
would
be
upset
the
villages
would
be
alarmed
and
his
own
life
greatly
jeopardized
too
steep
a
price
by
far
to
pay
to
save
one
wretched
little
black
imp
from
being
devoured
by
a
crocodile
he
told
himself
the
road
to
wealth
did
not
lie
that
way
and
the
cruel
sneer
that
drooped
his
lips
as
he
lowered
his
weapon
was
not
good
to
behold
as
he
stood
up
to
witness
the
end
of
this
impromptu
hunt
whose
quarry
was
human
the
boys
on
the
bank
were
shouting
and
screaming
partly
for
help
partly
in
the
hope
of
scaring
the
hideous
saurian
that
wily
reptile
however
heeded
them
not
one
atom
his
great
jaws
opened
and
closed
with
a
snap
but
not
on
the
crunch
of
human
flesh
not
on
the
crackle
of
human
bones
the
wretched
little
native
with
incredible
dexterity
had
swerved
and
dived
just
eluding
the
hungry
jaws
by
no
more
than
a
breadth
but
to
what
avail
for
the
smooth
surface
of
the
lagoon
was
now
rippling
into
long
waves
dark
objects
were
gliding
through
the
water
with
noiseless
rapidity
converging
on
the
point
where
the
human
quarry
had
now
risen
to
breathe
more
of
the
dreadful
reptiles
with
which
the
lagoons
were
swarming
had
found
out
there
was
prey
and
were
bearing
down
to
obtain
their
share
from
his
concealment
laurence
could
see
it
all
the
glistening
of
the
hideous
snouts
the
round
woolly
head
and
staring
eyeballs
of
the
miserable
little
victim
then
with
a
wild
piercing
shriek
the
latter
disappeared
and
there
arose
to
the
surface
a
boil
of
foam
bubbling
upon
the
slimy
water
in
a
bright
red
stain
below
in
the
depths
the
crocodiles
were
rending
asunder
their
unexpected
prey
the
moral
of
that
episode
said
the
concealed
spectator
to
himself
as
he
turned
away
is
that
little
boys
should
not
play
too
near
the
bank
no
there
is
yet
another
the
incredibly
short
space
of
time
in
which
the
refined
and
civilized
being
can
turn
into
a
demon
and
the
causes
which
accomplish
such
transmogrification
are
twain
the
parting
with
all
his
illusions
and
the
parting
with
all
his
cash
these
ruminations
were
cut
short
in
a
manner
that
was
violent
not
to
say
alarming
two
spears
whizzed
past
him
with
a
vicious
angry
hiss
one
burying
itself
deep
in
the
stem
of
the
just
behind
him
the
other
flying
into
empty
space
but
grazing
his
ear
by
very
few
inches
indeed
then
in
the
wild
barking
yell
in
its
note
of
hate
and
fury
laurence
stanninghame
realized
that
he
was
in
a
tight
place
a
very
tight
place
chapter
xv
an
awakening
ten
or
a
dozen
tall
savages
were
advancing
through
the
somewhat
sparse
scrub
yielding
to
a
first
impulse
of
laurence
quick
as
thought
stepped
behind
the
stem
of
the
then
he
peered
forth
his
first
glance
keen
and
quick
took
in
every
detail
his
assailants
were
fine
men
ferocious
looking
in
great
crested
headgear
of
plumes
their
bodies
were
adorned
with
circlets
but
save
for
a
short
kilt
of
and
hide
they
were
quite
unclad
they
carried
large
shields
of
the
zulu
pattern
and
a
sheaf
of
gleaming
spears
some
light
others
heavy
and
strong
with
the
blade
like
a
cutlass
who
what
could
they
be
he
wondered
they
were
too
fine
and
stately
of
aspect
with
their
lofty
commanding
brows
and
clear
full
glance
to
belong
to
any
of
the
tribes
around
they
were
not
wangoni
they
wore
too
striking
a
look
to
come
of
even
that
fine
race
who
could
they
be
his
conjectures
on
that
head
rapid
as
they
were
ceased
abruptly
for
a
perfect
volley
of
spears
came
whizzing
about
him
several
burying
their
heads
deep
within
the
stem
of
the
well
indeed
for
him
that
he
had
so
rapidly
placed
even
that
slight
rampart
between
himself
and
his
enemies
deeming
parley
better
than
fight
under
the
circumstances
laurence
began
quickly
upon
them
in
a
mixture
of
swahili
and
zulu
declaring
that
he
could
be
no
enemy
to
them
or
to
their
race
but
a
loud
mocking
laugh
drowned
his
words
and
seeing
that
the
savages
had
suddenly
half
crouched
behind
their
shields
for
a
charge
his
quick
resourceful
brain
grasped
the
situation
at
once
a
puff
of
smoke
a
jet
of
flame
from
behind
the
one
of
the
warriors
fell
forward
on
his
shield
beating
the
earth
with
his
great
limbs
in
the
throes
of
death
they
had
hardly
reckoned
upon
this
crouching
low
now
they
glide
away
among
the
scrub
keeping
well
within
cover
but
that
solitary
determined
man
flattened
there
against
the
draws
no
hope
from
this
their
manoeuvre
is
a
simple
one
enough
they
are
going
to
enfilade
the
position
surrounded
on
all
sides
and
by
such
foes
as
these
where
will
he
be
for
he
has
no
cover
but
in
laurence
stanninghame
stern
eyes
there
is
a
lurid
a
very
demon
light
his
enemies
will
have
his
life
but
they
will
purchase
it
at
a
long
price
a
dead
silence
now
reigns
and
through
it
he
can
hear
the
stealthy
rustle
made
by
his
foes
in
their
efforts
to
surround
him
were
he
in
the
comparative
security
of
cover
or
behind
a
rampart
of
any
sort
he
might
hope
by
a
superhuman
effort
of
quick
firing
to
hold
them
back
as
it
is
he
dare
not
move
from
behind
his
tree
suspecting
an
intention
to
draw
him
thence
the
sun
flames
upon
the
lagoon
and
upon
a
flight
of
flamingoes
winnowing
above
the
surface
and
as
though
the
situation
were
not
deadly
and
desperate
enough
the
shimmer
of
light
and
water
has
even
in
that
brief
glance
brought
a
spot
in
front
of
his
eyes
at
the
moment
when
if
ever
his
sight
should
be
at
its
clearest
and
quickest
the
odds
against
him
are
indeed
terrible
he
can
hardly
hope
to
come
through
yet
to
his
assailants
it
well
may
prove
the
dearest
victory
they
have
ever
won
a
dark
body
creeping
among
the
scrub
just
a
glimpse
and
nothing
more
his
piece
is
at
his
shoulder
and
the
trigger
is
pressed
he
has
not
missed
of
that
he
is
sure
but
the
echoes
of
his
shot
are
swallowed
up
drowned
in
a
hundred
other
echoes
reverberating
upon
the
dim
silence
of
the
scrub
echoes
no
the
screech
and
tear
of
missiles
very
near
to
his
own
head
the
smoke
the
jets
of
flame
from
half
a
hundred
different
points
all
this
is
sufficient
to
show
that
these
are
no
echoes
his
own
people
have
come
up
he
is
rescued
but
only
just
in
the
nick
of
time
look
out
he
shouts
in
stentorian
tones
do
fire
this
way
hazon
holmes
i
here
keep
the
fools
in
hand
they
are
blazing
at
me
but
the
crash
of
the
volley
drowns
his
voice
and
the
scrub
is
alive
with
swarming
natives
armed
with
firelocks
of
every
description
yet
above
the
volley
and
the
savage
shouts
laurence
can
hear
the
hoarse
barking
yell
can
descry
the
forms
of
his
late
enemies
such
as
are
left
of
them
as
they
flee
leaping
and
bounding
zigzagging
with
incredible
velocity
and
address
to
avoid
the
hail
of
bullets
which
is
poured
after
them
he
can
realize
something
more
something
which
sends
through
his
whole
being
a
cold
shudder
of
dismay
and
despair
not
his
own
people
are
these
otherwise
so
opportune
arrivals
not
his
own
people
but
the
inhabitants
of
the
villages
his
own
people
are
on
their
way
to
raid
fierce
and
savage
cannibals
by
habit
but
with
physique
which
will
furnish
excellent
slaves
he
has
literally
fallen
from
the
into
the
fire
how
he
curses
his
raw
folly
in
making
his
presence
known
but
for
this
he
might
have
slipped
away
unnoticed
during
the
scrimmage
now
they
come
crowding
up
brandishing
their
weapons
and
yelling
hideously
although
inferior
both
in
aspect
and
stature
to
those
they
have
just
defeated
these
barbarians
are
formidable
enough
their
wildly
ferocious
mien
many
of
them
too
have
filed
teeth
which
imparts
to
their
hideous
countenances
the
most
appearance
is
it
that
in
the
apparently
fearless
attitude
the
stern
even
commanding
glance
of
this
solitary
white
man
there
is
something
that
overawes
them
it
may
be
so
for
they
stop
short
in
their
hostile
demonstrations
and
commence
a
parley
yet
not
altogether
does
laurence
stanninghame
feel
relieved
for
a
sudden
thought
surges
through
his
brain
which
causes
a
shade
of
paleness
to
sweep
over
his
firm
bronzed
countenance
what
if
this
were
but
a
scheme
to
get
him
into
their
power
what
if
he
were
not
suffered
to
die
fighting
to
fall
into
their
hands
alive
why
then
his
fate
was
certain
certain
and
inexpressibly
horrible
he
would
be
butchered
like
a
calf
butchered
and
eaten
by
these
repulsive
wretches
such
would
be
his
end
now
however
to
make
the
best
of
the
situation
but
little
can
he
make
of
their
tongue
then
he
tries
them
in
swahili
ah
several
of
them
have
a
smattering
of
that
they
have
come
to
his
aid
at
a
critical
moment
he
puts
it
he
is
willing
therefore
to
call
them
friends
yet
it
was
a
pity
they
had
he
had
already
killed
two
of
his
assailants
and
was
prepared
to
kill
them
all
one
after
another
it
was
only
a
question
of
time
after
all
if
anything
the
new
arrivals
had
rather
spoiled
his
sport
these
stared
the
tone
was
one
of
patronage
of
condescension
this
white
man
was
but
one
he
was
alone
and
in
their
power
yet
he
spoke
to
them
as
a
great
chief
might
speak
yet
was
he
but
one
was
he
alone
or
were
many
others
not
far
off
perceptibly
their
own
replies
took
on
a
respectful
air
the
while
laurence
kept
every
sense
on
the
alert
indeed
even
to
its
uttermost
tension
was
this
parley
designed
to
keep
him
preoccupied
while
others
stole
up
treacherously
to
strike
him
down
from
behind
to
guard
against
this
idea
he
stepped
boldly
forth
from
the
and
advanced
towards
the
crowd
where
are
those
we
have
slain
he
said
let
us
examine
them
yonder
answered
some
in
a
wandering
tone
while
others
on
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
scowled
and
muttered
leisurely
and
now
moving
actually
among
these
people
did
laurence
fare
forth
to
look
upon
the
bodies
of
his
late
assailants
the
thoroughly
bold
and
fearless
line
he
had
adopted
had
told
as
he
was
all
but
sure
it
would
these
wild
barbarians
armed
to
the
teeth
had
only
to
stretch
forth
a
hand
and
slay
him
yet
somehow
they
refrained
the
slain
warriors
were
lying
as
they
fell
and
even
in
death
laurence
could
not
but
admire
their
noble
proportions
and
the
set
and
martial
expression
of
their
countenances
six
lay
dead
while
another
sorely
wounded
was
promptly
beheaded
by
the
new
arrivals
these
their
savage
instincts
all
afire
set
to
work
to
hack
the
heads
off
each
corpse
then
tying
grass
ropes
around
the
ankles
the
trunks
were
dragged
away
to
the
village
to
the
latter
now
they
invited
laurence
to
hesitate
might
be
an
act
of
weakness
sufficient
to
cause
his
slaughter
to
acquiesce
on
the
other
hand
was
it
not
an
act
of
unexampled
foolhardiness
thus
to
place
himself
more
absolutely
within
the
power
of
these
savage
cannibals
his
policy
of
boldness
had
availed
so
far
it
would
not
do
to
break
down
at
the
last
moment
so
he
accepted
without
a
shade
of
hesitation
how
is
your
tribe
named
he
asked
as
they
proceeded
along
wajalu
replied
the
man
who
had
done
chief
spokesman
rather
a
native
with
almost
a
zulu
cast
of
countenance
and
the
head
man
of
yonder
village
who
is
he
i
am
he
i
mgara
was
the
reply
with
a
satisfied
smile
and
those
we
have
slain
they
seemed
fine
fighters
of
what
race
were
they
laurence
looked
grave
but
said
nothing
strange
rumours
mysterious
and
vague
had
reached
him
already
rumours
relating
to
an
immensely
powerful
tribe
inhabiting
the
dark
and
unexplored
country
away
to
the
north
whose
raids
were
extending
more
and
more
whose
wrath
fell
alike
upon
all
upon
arab
and
the
prey
sought
by
the
latter
a
tribe
said
to
have
taken
its
origin
in
some
hardly
recorded
exodus
in
the
days
of
tshaka
zulu
alike
in
its
habits
and
customs
and
in
the
despotism
of
its
ruler
this
nation
was
known
as
the
abagcatya
or
the
people
of
the
spider
hazon
too
believed
in
its
existence
and
hazon
was
a
authority
on
such
subjects
and
now
the
warriors
who
had
attacked
him
and
upon
whom
the
tables
were
so
strangely
turned
were
zulu
in
aspect
and
bore
zulu
shields
the
thing
began
to
look
serious
what
if
that
handful
of
warriors
was
the
outpost
of
a
huge
would
not
the
vengeance
of
the
latter
be
fearful
and
complete
and
indeed
time
was
when
laurence
stanninghame
blood
would
have
boiled
with
rage
and
disgust
at
the
indignities
offered
to
the
remains
of
these
warriors
the
trunks
dragged
along
by
the
heels
seemed
nothing
now
but
a
bleeding
mass
the
heads
too
stuck
upon
spear
points
were
borne
aloft
above
the
rabble
to
them
were
all
sorts
of
mockeries
addressed
now
however
it
was
different
the
hardening
process
had
been
if
anything
all
too
complete
a
man
had
his
hands
full
even
if
occupied
solely
in
taking
care
of
himself
this
had
become
the
sum
total
of
his
creed
as
they
drew
near
the
village
the
wajalu
set
up
the
most
hideously
discordant
he
had
ever
heard
in
his
life
they
were
met
in
the
gate
by
a
crowd
of
women
howling
and
blowing
horns
and
otherwise
adding
to
the
horrific
tumult
these
on
beholding
the
stranger
imagined
him
a
prisoner
and
began
clamouring
for
his
death
pointing
to
the
bloodstained
place
of
slaughter
where
such
were
wont
to
be
immolated
and
then
once
more
hearing
the
shout
of
demoniacal
laughter
which
arose
from
some
of
the
fighting
men
noting
a
ferociously
sardonic
grin
upon
not
a
few
faces
laurence
felt
his
former
misgivings
all
return
accustomed
as
he
was
to
perilous
situations
to
horrifying
sights
the
strain
upon
his
nerves
was
becoming
painfully
intense
fortunate
indeed
for
him
that
those
nerves
were
now
hardened
to
the
cold
consistency
of
cast
steel
by
almost
daily
trial
men
of
the
wajalu
he
began
in
a
decisive
commanding
voice
well
is
it
for
all
here
that
i
am
among
you
this
day
as
a
friend
and
guest
for
but
for
that
this
village
was
doomed
you
know
not
who
i
am
but
you
shall
know
in
time
then
you
will
know
that
but
for
my
presence
here
the
spear
and
the
would
have
been
your
portion
that
of
your
village
the
flames
now
i
give
you
your
lives
the
words
hurriedly
rendered
to
those
who
could
not
understand
by
those
who
could
perhaps
more
the
haughty
indifference
of
his
tone
his
bearing
his
appearance
in
general
hard
and
determined
overawed
the
crowd
no
further
voice
was
raised
against
him
their
advances
of
hospitality
became
even
profuse
he
was
shown
to
the
best
hut
but
before
he
entered
it
he
could
not
avoid
seeing
the
bodies
of
his
late
assailants
in
process
of
dismemberment
as
though
they
had
been
slaughtered
cattle
and
inured
as
he
was
to
horrible
and
sickening
sights
never
had
he
been
conscious
of
so
overpowering
a
feeling
of
repulsion
as
now
the
cannibal
atrocities
of
these
human
beasts
the
glowering
heads
stuck
all
over
the
stockade
the
latest
addition
thereto
being
those
of
the
slain
the
influence
of
death
brooding
over
this
demoniacal
haunt
even
as
the
circlings
of
carrion
birds
high
in
all
this
weighed
upon
his
mind
until
he
could
have
blown
out
his
own
brains
for
sheer
horror
and
loathing
but
upon
this
dark
enshrouding
shadow
piercing
partly
dispelling
it
came
a
ray
of
searching
light
sweet
golden
penetrating
the
vision
of
his
midday
slumbers
lilith
but
a
few
hours
had
gone
by
since
that
dream
and
within
them
he
had
fought
fiercely
for
his
life
and
now
in
this
the
sweet
entrancement
of
it
came
back
to
charm
away
as
with
a
hallowed
spell
the
black
horrors
that
hung
over
his
soul
as
though
on
vulture
wing
presently
mgara
entered
followed
by
people
bearing
food
cooked
and
millet
and
plantains
from
the
smoking
meat
laurence
recoiled
with
a
loathing
he
could
hardly
repress
it
was
too
suggestive
of
the
foul
and
fearful
feast
proceeding
outside
and
even
when
the
chief
with
a
furtive
assured
him
he
might
safely
partake
of
it
yet
he
could
not
touch
it
contenting
himself
with
the
other
fare
cereal
and
vegetable
after
some
further
talk
mgara
withdrew
and
laurence
left
alone
gave
his
meditations
the
rein
once
more
never
had
he
loathed
the
sinister
occupation
upon
which
he
was
embarked
as
he
did
now
possibly
because
the
term
of
the
undertaking
was
nearing
its
end
i
predict
you
will
come
back
with
what
you
want
lilith
had
said
and
her
words
had
been
fully
verified
he
had
gained
riches
even
beyond
his
wildest
dreams
but
how
he
had
gained
them
trafficking
in
human
flesh
and
blood
yea
even
human
life
she
should
never
know
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
he
were
already
returning
with
that
which
should
place
all
the
world
at
his
feet
but
for
once
he
seemed
to
forget
that
he
had
not
yet
returned
not
yet
and
as
the
drums
and
yelling
of
the
barbarous
orgy
outside
gradually
sank
into
the
silence
of
night
even
that
strange
to
say
failed
to
remind
him
chapter
xvi
an
angel
unawares
not
much
sleep
did
laurence
get
that
night
such
indeed
as
he
obtained
being
of
the
with
one
eye
open
order
simple
trust
in
anybody
or
anything
was
not
one
of
his
failings
as
we
think
we
have
shown
wherefore
having
carefully
scrutinized
the
plastered
walls
of
his
rude
quarters
he
took
the
precaution
to
secure
the
wicker
door
from
the
inside
and
lay
down
with
his
express
so
covering
the
same
that
but
the
very
slightest
movement
of
the
hand
would
be
needed
on
his
part
in
order
to
rake
from
stem
to
stern
whosoever
should
be
so
as
to
essay
a
stealthy
ingress
still
more
would
he
have
applauded
his
own
foresight
in
taking
these
precautions
could
he
have
known
that
a
large
portion
of
the
night
was
spent
by
his
entertainers
keenly
debating
the
expediency
of
treacherously
putting
him
to
death
here
it
was
urged
was
an
opportunity
such
as
might
never
again
come
their
way
here
was
one
of
the
leaders
of
that
dreaded
band
of
one
whose
very
name
was
a
terror
and
a
scourge
here
was
this
man
actually
in
their
hands
it
was
in
their
power
to
slay
him
without
the
smallest
risk
to
themselves
let
them
not
miss
such
an
opportunity
of
setting
up
his
head
above
their
gates
as
for
his
party
now
that
its
existence
was
known
they
could
surprise
it
and
slaughter
every
man
it
contained
they
the
wajalu
were
numerous
and
had
good
and
knew
how
to
use
them
why
should
they
not
rid
the
land
of
this
terror
it
was
in
their
power
to
do
so
this
sounded
all
very
plausible
many
tales
do
until
their
other
side
is
told
and
the
other
side
was
unfolded
by
the
head
man
mgara
and
others
much
to
this
effect
the
were
more
numerous
than
many
there
imagined
they
had
been
reinforced
by
a
large
body
of
wangoni
fierce
and
formidable
fighters
to
surprise
and
overwhelm
such
a
force
would
be
impossible
and
in
the
event
of
failure
what
would
their
own
fate
be
moreover
it
was
certain
that
the
slavers
were
much
better
armed
than
the
wajalu
their
best
policy
would
be
to
treat
the
man
well
he
had
already
given
what
was
as
good
as
an
assurance
of
his
protection
these
counsels
prevailed
and
soon
the
wisdom
thereof
was
made
manifest
for
with
earliest
dawn
one
of
their
scouts
came
running
in
with
the
news
that
the
were
approaching
that
they
were
in
great
numbers
and
mostly
armed
with
rifles
that
it
was
too
late
for
retreat
in
that
a
large
detachment
had
already
gained
a
position
which
was
practically
such
as
to
surround
the
village
the
effect
of
this
news
was
to
stamp
with
an
expression
of
the
most
despair
the
countenance
of
every
man
who
heard
it
but
mgara
remembering
the
words
of
their
white
guest
hurried
to
the
hut
where
the
latter
was
sleeping
yet
as
the
head
man
approached
the
door
with
a
quick
deferential
word
of
greeting
laurence
stanninghame
was
wide
awake
the
talk
outside
the
rapid
note
of
fear
underlying
the
tone
had
not
escaped
him
and
even
though
he
understood
not
a
word
of
their
talk
among
themselves
he
knew
what
these
people
wanted
of
him
and
the
situation
looked
serious
for
he
felt
far
less
confident
of
his
ability
to
redeem
his
pledge
than
when
moved
by
the
first
instincts
of
he
had
given
the
same
well
and
what
then
the
extinction
of
this
horde
of
cannibal
barbarians
was
a
mere
trifle
a
drop
in
the
bucket
when
looked
at
beside
other
dark
and
ruthless
deeds
which
he
had
witnessed
and
even
actually
aided
in
but
hard
pitiless
utterly
impervious
to
human
suffering
as
he
had
become
there
was
one
point
in
laurence
stanninghame
character
a
weak
point
he
regarded
it
which
he
had
never
succeeded
in
eradicating
he
could
not
forget
or
ignore
a
good
turn
these
people
monstrous
repulsive
as
they
were
in
his
sight
had
saved
his
life
twice
indeed
the
first
time
unconsciously
from
the
the
second
time
from
themselves
they
might
have
slain
him
barbarously
at
almost
any
moment
he
was
but
one
among
a
number
yet
they
had
not
but
instead
had
treated
him
hospitably
and
well
he
was
resolved
at
any
risk
to
save
them
mgara
entering
lost
no
time
in
making
known
his
errand
o
stranger
guest
whom
we
have
treated
as
a
friend
he
began
save
us
from
the
and
the
guns
and
spears
of
your
people
for
they
are
upon
us
already
and
rapidly
he
narrated
the
tidings
brought
in
by
the
scouts
i
will
do
what
i
can
mgara
answered
laurence
listen
all
your
people
must
retire
within
the
huts
not
one
must
be
seen
further
two
of
your
men
must
bear
a
token
from
me
to
el
khanac
my
who
leads
yonder
host
and
that
at
once
now
call
those
two
men
swift
of
resource
laurence
picked
up
a
flat
piece
of
wood
and
scraping
it
smooth
with
his
knife
wrote
upon
it
in
pencil
owe
these
people
my
life
keep
ours
in
hand
until
we
these
are
the
messengers
mgara
he
went
on
as
the
head
man
returned
accompanied
by
two
men
are
they
reliable
and
above
all
fearless
they
are
both
sidi
answered
the
chief
now
very
deferential
one
is
my
son
the
other
my
brother
son
good
let
them
now
get
a
piece
of
white
flaxen
cloth
and
bind
it
and
this
token
to
a
staff
then
let
them
seek
out
el
khanac
yonder
in
a
moment
this
was
done
and
bearing
the
impromptu
white
flag
and
the
writing
on
the
board
the
two
young
men
started
off
into
the
scrub
retire
now
into
your
houses
mgara
you
and
all
your
people
i
alone
will
stand
within
the
gate
and
maybe
it
will
be
well
with
you
the
wajalu
who
had
been
hanging
on
every
word
now
hastened
to
obey
nevertheless
there
was
terror
and
dejection
in
every
face
and
their
thoughts
were
much
the
same
as
those
of
their
deliverer
had
he
the
power
to
make
good
his
word
the
hot
morning
hours
dragged
slowly
by
and
still
no
sign
of
attack
the
village
was
a
deserted
place
in
its
brooding
silence
so
still
so
complete
as
to
render
distinctly
audible
the
sweep
of
the
wings
of
carrion
birds
circling
aloft
the
severed
heads
grinned
hideously
from
the
stockade
and
the
unearthly
molten
stillness
of
the
silent
noon
was
such
as
to
get
upon
the
nerves
of
the
ordinary
watcher
but
he
who
now
stood
there
had
no
nerves
not
in
a
matter
of
this
kind
his
experiences
had
been
such
as
to
kill
and
crush
them
out
of
all
being
ha
what
was
this
the
crows
and
vultures
which
emboldened
by
the
deathly
silence
had
been
circling
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
tree
tops
suddenly
and
with
one
accord
shot
upward
now
seeming
mere
specks
in
the
blue
ether
then
the
silence
was
broken
in
appalling
fashion
rending
the
air
in
a
terrific
note
of
savagery
and
there
burst
forth
the
harsh
hissing
of
the
wangoni
it
came
from
the
forest
edge
on
the
farther
side
of
the
village
laurence
realized
with
vexation
and
concern
that
his
merciful
plan
would
be
extremely
difficult
to
carry
out
that
these
ferocious
auxiliaries
should
be
allowed
to
initiate
the
attack
he
had
not
reckoned
upon
and
now
to
restrain
them
would
be
a
herculean
task
back
back
he
shouted
meeting
the
crowd
of
charging
savages
who
shield
and
spear
uplifted
were
bearing
down
in
full
career
upon
the
village
in
the
headlong
exciting
moment
of
their
charge
they
hardly
recognized
him
laurence
stanninghame
life
hung
upon
a
hair
then
with
a
great
burst
of
laughter
mocking
half
defiant
they
surged
past
him
they
saw
red
and
no
power
on
earth
seemed
able
to
stop
those
human
wolves
now
rushing
upon
their
helpless
prey
back
back
thundered
laurence
again
the
village
is
dead
i
tell
you
it
is
the
abode
of
death
this
told
barbarians
have
a
shrinking
horror
of
infectious
disease
thoughts
of
smallpox
cholera
what
not
arose
in
the
minds
of
these
no
other
consideration
on
earth
could
have
restrained
that
charge
yet
this
one
did
they
stopped
short
lo
the
stillness
the
silence
went
on
laurence
pointing
to
the
lifeless
village
would
you
too
travel
the
voiceless
and
weaponless
path
of
death
but
mutterings
both
loud
and
deep
went
through
the
wangoni
ranks
what
was
this
they
had
been
ordered
to
charge
been
signalled
to
charge
and
now
they
were
forbidden
to
enter
the
village
el
afà
the
serpent
had
been
absent
from
the
expedition
and
now
turned
up
here
alone
savages
are
ever
suspicious
and
these
were
no
exception
to
the
rule
of
their
kind
what
does
it
mean
half
sneered
their
leader
scowling
resentfully
upon
laurence
as
the
warriors
crowded
around
growling
like
a
pack
of
baffled
wolves
had
we
not
better
send
some
in
to
see
if
these
dogs
are
indeed
all
dead
not
so
mashumbwe
was
the
unconcerned
reply
tarry
until
the
others
arrive
then
will
we
act
together
but
a
furious
clamour
arose
at
the
words
the
wangoni
did
not
entirely
believe
the
explanation
and
to
further
their
doubts
there
now
arose
from
the
inside
of
the
huts
the
puling
wail
of
infants
which
the
mothers
had
not
been
entirely
able
to
stifle
we
will
add
those
to
the
death
number
at
least
said
the
chief
giving
the
signal
to
his
followers
to
advance
not
so
said
laurence
decisively
hearken
mashumbwe
you
are
chief
of
your
own
people
but
i
am
chief
of
all
not
a
man
stirs
until
el
khanac
comes
up
not
a
man
do
you
hear
mashumbwe
tossed
back
his
ringed
head
and
his
eyes
glared
he
was
a
tall
fine
savage
with
all
the
pride
of
mien
inseparable
from
his
rank
and
zulu
blood
thus
they
stood
the
savage
and
the
white
man
looking
into
each
other
eyes
the
one
in
a
blaze
of
haughty
anger
the
other
cool
resolute
and
absolutely
unflinching
how
it
would
end
heaven
alone
knew
but
now
the
very
thing
that
laurence
had
been
longing
for
happened
a
hurried
murmur
ran
through
the
wangoni
lines
the
main
body
of
the
had
emerged
from
the
scrub
and
had
quietly
surrounded
the
village
laurence
was
satisfied
he
had
gained
time
so
far
and
with
it
his
object
what
astonishing
freak
is
this
stanninghame
said
hazon
who
having
taken
in
the
situation
at
a
glance
was
promptly
at
his
side
displaying
too
the
piece
of
pencilled
board
what
becomes
of
our
pact
when
such
a
consideration
as
this
comes
in
he
continued
meaningly
tapping
the
inscription
on
the
board
have
we
obtained
all
we
wanted
on
those
terms
up
till
now
or
not
no
we
have
but
now
having
obtained
almost
all
we
wanted
we
can
afford
to
do
this
for
once
if
it
had
been
your
life
instead
of
mine
these
people
had
saved
twice
hazon
i
would
willingly
have
spared
theirs
now
will
you
do
less
for
me
but
it
will
breed
a
mutiny
among
our
people
said
hazon
doubtfully
with
a
half
glance
at
the
crowd
of
scowling
wangoni
oh
a
mutiny
by
all
means
we
shall
know
how
to
deal
with
that
as
we
did
before
it
seemed
as
though
such
knowledge
were
about
to
be
called
into
requisition
for
the
announcement
that
all
this
property
was
to
be
relinquished
absolutely
was
received
by
the
more
important
section
of
the
with
a
sullen
silence
more
eloquent
even
that
the
wolfish
growls
of
the
wangoni
the
latter
disappointment
lay
in
the
fact
that
they
were
balked
in
giving
vent
to
their
instincts
of
sheer
savagery
the
delight
of
plunder
and
massacre
that
of
the
former
however
was
a
more
weighty
factor
to
reckon
with
for
the
smatter
of
civilization
in
the
arab
and
swahili
element
had
brought
with
it
the
commercial
instinct
of
cupidity
it
speaks
volumes
therefore
for
the
ascendency
which
these
two
resolute
white
men
had
set
up
over
their
wild
and
lawless
following
that
the
latter
should
have
contented
itself
with
mere
sullen
obedience
having
gained
his
point
laurence
returned
within
the
village
and
calling
mgara
suggested
that
some
of
the
people
should
carry
forth
food
to
their
unwelcome
visitors
i
fear
it
may
leave
scarcity
in
your
midst
he
added
but
men
are
in
better
mood
than
hungry
ones
mgara
and
are
you
not
spared
the
and
the
spear
the
head
man
with
many
deferential
expressions
of
gratitude
agreed
and
soon
a
file
of
women
and
boys
were
told
off
bringing
goats
and
millet
and
rice
for
the
as
they
passed
tremblingly
among
the
ranks
of
the
wangoni
the
latter
handled
their
great
spears
meaningly
and
with
much
the
same
expression
of
countenance
as
a
cat
might
wear
when
contemplating
an
inaccessible
bird
cage
ho
dog
cried
mashumbwe
as
a
youth
passed
before
him
without
making
obeisance
do
you
dare
stand
before
me
before
me
thou
spawn
of
these
jackals
lo
lie
prostrate
forever
and
with
the
words
he
half
threw
half
thrust
his
great
spear
into
the
unfortunate
lad
body
the
blood
spurted
forth
in
a
great
jet
and
staggering
the
boy
fell
and
am
i
to
be
defiled
with
the
blood
of
such
as
this
growled
the
chief
upon
whom
several
red
drops
had
squirted
let
that
carrion
be
removed
several
of
the
wangoni
sprang
forward
and
as
the
quivering
body
was
dragged
away
these
savages
gave
vent
to
their
ferocity
by
stabbing
it
again
and
again
having
tasted
blood
they
rolled
their
eyes
around
in
search
of
further
victims
but
the
remaining
wajalu
had
withdrawn
in
terror
and
well
for
all
concerned
that
it
was
so
otherwise
the
wangoni
inspired
by
the
example
of
their
chief
would
certainly
have
commenced
a
massacre
which
even
the
prestige
and
authority
of
hazon
and
laurence
combined
would
have
been
powerless
to
quell
but
there
was
no
one
outside
to
begin
upon
and
though
a
truculent
unruly
crowd
their
interests
in
the
long
run
lay
in
submitting
to
the
authority
of
the
white
chiefs
so
the
wajalu
rejoiced
much
if
tremblingly
as
the
last
of
the
dreaded
host
disappeared
for
good
or
for
ill
their
village
was
spared
spared
to
continue
its
most
revolting
forms
of
savagery
and
cannibalism
and
parricide
spared
for
good
or
for
ill
in
that
it
had
entertained
an
angel
unawares
in
the
person

dissensions
well
i
uncommonly
glad
i
was
out
of
that
affair
yesterday
stanninghame
but
it
is
like
you
letting
those
poor
devils
off
eh
thus
holmes
as
the
two
were
leisurely
pursuing
their
way
somewhat
on
the
rear
flank
of
the
i
do
know
you
see
they
let
me
off
and
i
did
want
to
be
outdone
in
civility
even
by
a
lot
of
scurvy
dogs
who
eat
each
other
there
was
no
feeling
about
the
matter
before
the
other
could
pursue
the
subject
the
sound
of
faint
groans
and
pleading
in
an
unknown
tongue
was
heard
just
ahead
with
it
too
the
sound
of
blows
some
devilish
work
going
forward
again
muttered
holmes
with
savage
disgust
you
ca
make
omelettes
without
breaking
eggs
was
the
indifferent
reply
and
then
they
came
upon
a
not
entirely
unfamiliar
scene
on
the
ground
crouched
three
human
figures
and
emaciated
to
the
last
degree
disease
and
exhaustion
had
overpowered
them
and
they
were
begging
to
be
left
to
die
standing
over
them
in
threatening
attitude
was
lutali
with
some
of
the
slavers
they
are
too
far
gone
to
feel
the
whip
lutali
was
saying
clearly
they
are
of
no
further
use
you
murad
shorten
me
the
shadow
of
yonder
dog
we
shall
see
the
man
named
a
ruffian
stepped
forward
grinning
with
delight
just
as
he
was
swinging
up
his
scimitar
holmes
burst
forth
hold
on
lutali
give
the
poor
devil
another
show
half
turning
his
head
at
this
interruption
there
was
that
look
upon
the
features
of
the
arab
which
at
times
so
strangely
resembled
hazon
his
keen
eyes
darted
haughty
reproof
at
holmes
for
he
was
a
sort
of
supercargo
of
the
slave
department
and
relished
not
this
interference
then
turning
back
he
once
more
gave
the
signal
down
flashed
the
great
blade
there
was
a
dull
swooshing
thud
and
the
headless
trunk
was
deluging
the
earth
the
effect
however
upon
the
other
two
exhausted
wretches
was
magical
with
a
despairing
effort
they
raised
themselves
up
and
staggered
on
to
the
accompaniment
of
not
a
few
blows
by
way
of
recognition
of
their
malingering
lutali
who
had
uttered
no
word
and
whose
impassive
countenance
had
not
moved
a
feature
stalked
gravely
on
why
could
we
not
have
prevented
this
burst
forth
holmes
whom
a
sort
of
morbid
fascination
seemed
to
root
to
the
spot
because
it
would
have
been
the
very
acme
of
insanity
to
attempt
such
a
thing
lutali
in
common
with
the
rest
is
in
far
too
ugly
a
mood
after
yesterday
to
be
fooled
with
needlessly
besides
all
that
sentiment
is
simply
thrown
away
these
people
remember
are
atrocious
brutes
who
eat
their
own
fathers
and
mothers
it
is
positively
a
work
of
charity
to
enslave
them
once
they
are
off
the
march
they
are
fairly
well
treated
better
in
fact
than
they
treat
each
other
and
of
course
no
more
cannibalism
that
may
be
but
i
wish
to
heaven
i
could
blot
out
these
two
years
as
though
they
had
never
been
the
recollection
of
the
horrors
one
has
been
through
will
haunt
me
for
life
i
feel
like
blowing
my
brains
out
in
sheer
disgust
why
did
i
ever
come
it
was
not
the
first
time
holmes
had
burst
forth
in
this
fashion
as
we
have
shown
laurence
looked
keenly
at
him
there
is
a
worse
thing
to
haunt
one
life
than
recollection
he
said
and
that
is
anticipation
of
what
asked
holmes
shortly
the
other
touched
the
muzzle
of
his
rifle
then
his
own
forehead
it
that
or
this
he
said
pointing
to
the
ghastly
trunk
and
the
severed
head
which
lay
before
them
you
do
suppose
i
should
have
adopted
this
sweet
trade
from
choice
i
suppose
no
hard
necessity
my
dear
chap
if
anybody
has
to
go
under
and
somebody
always
has
to
i
prefer
that
it
shall
not
be
me
holmes
made
no
reply
for
a
while
so
they
left
the
spot
walking
in
silence
then
laurence
went
on
now
we
are
on
the
subject
i
do
know
that
you
would
have
come
out
any
the
better
had
we
left
you
behind
at
johannesburg
for
you
were
going
the
wrong
way
you
were
a
precious
sight
too
fond
of
hanging
around
bars
and
that
sort
of
thing
grows
in
fact
you
were
more
than
once
a
trifle
shall
we
say
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
upon
it
you
were
on
your
way
to
the
deuce
i
know
it
for
i
seen
it
so
often
before
and
you
know
it
too
i
believe
you
right
there
assented
holmes
well
then
we
owe
our
first
duty
to
ourselves
wherefore
my
young
friend
it
is
better
to
spend
a
year
or
two
raking
in
a
fortune
and
ameliorating
the
lot
of
humanity
than
to
die
in
a
state
of
soak
and
a
disused
shaft
on
or
around
the
rand
even
as
did
pulman
the
day
before
we
left
i
do
believe
that
same
fortune
will
do
us
any
good
urged
holmes
gloomily
there
is
the
curse
of
blood
upon
it
the
curse
of
my
grandmother
laughed
the
other
there
was
no
affectation
about
laurence
stanninghame
indifference
it
was
perfectly
genuine
constitutionally
callous
through
stress
of
circumstances
such
sights
as
that
just
witnessed
told
not
one
atom
upon
him
in
the
sufferings
of
the
miserable
wretches
he
saw
only
a
lurid
alternative
his
own
in
them
toiling
along
wearily
dejectedly
beneath
the
chain
or
yoke
he
saw
himself
toiling
grinding
at
some
sordid
and
utterly
repellent
form
of
labour
for
a
miserable
pittance
no
ray
of
light
no
redeeming
rest
or
enjoyment
to
sweeten
life
until
that
life
should
end
in
them
cowering
writhing
beneath
the
driver
brutal
lash
he
saw
himself
ever
lashed
and
stung
by
the
torturing
consciousness
of
what
might
have
been
by
the
recollection
of
what
had
been
or
did
they
fall
exhausted
fainting
to
die
or
to
undergo
decapitation
to
insure
that
such
exhaustion
should
not
open
even
a
feeble
possibility
of
escape
there
too
he
saw
himself
sinking
borne
down
by
the
sheer
blank
hopelessness
of
fate
taking
refuge
in
the
dark
unknown
his
end
the
grave
of
the
suicide
it
was
himself
or
them
and
he
preferred
that
it
should
be
them
preyer
or
preyed
upon
such
was
the
iron
immutable
law
of
life
from
man
in
his
highest
development
to
the
minutest
of
insects
and
with
this
law
he
was
but
complying
not
in
wanton
cruelty
but
in
cold
passive
ruthlessness
further
the
sufferings
of
these
people
were
only
transitory
they
would
be
much
better
off
when
the
journey
was
ended
and
they
were
disposed
of
better
off
indeed
than
many
a
free
person
in
civilized
and
christian
lands
besides
such
races
as
these
low
down
as
they
were
in
the
scale
of
humanity
suffered
but
little
it
needs
imagination
refinement
to
accentuate
suffering
to
anything
approaching
such
attributes
these
were
utter
strangers
they
were
mere
animals
men
dealt
in
sheep
and
cattle
in
order
to
live
in
horses
and
other
beasts
of
burden
why
not
in
these
who
were
even
lower
than
the
higher
animals
this
theory
of
their
sinister
occupation
hazon
thoroughly
indorsed
depend
upon
it
stanninghame
he
said
ours
is
the
right
view
to
take
of
it
the
only
view
this
is
world
of
plunder
and
prey
as
tennyson
puts
it
and
we
have
got
to
prey
or
be
preyed
upon
you
for
instance
seem
to
have
fulfilled
the
latter
rôle
hitherto
and
it
seems
only
right
you
should
have
your
turn
now
to
cite
the
latest
instance
all
this
rotten
scrip
and
finished
you
off
and
what
was
that
but
rascality
of
course
i
been
plundered
swindled
all
along
the
line
ever
since
i
can
remember
i
tired
of
that
d
d
respectability
hazon
it
does
pay
it
never
has
paid
this
however
does
the
other
smiled
significantly
at
the
word
respectability
yes
he
said
look
at
your
type
of
success
your
man
swelling
out
of
his
white
waistcoat
in
snug
your
pattern
british
merchant
your
millionaire
financier
what
is
he
but
a
a
a
what
has
become
of
your
little
all
swamped
in
those
precious
rand
companies
stanninghame
gone
to
bloat
more
unimpeachable
white
waistcoats
gone
to
add
yet
more
pillars
to
the
temple
of
pattern
respectability
that
so
assented
laurence
with
something
between
a
sneer
and
a
laugh
knocking
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
yet
that
same
crowd
of
respectable
swindlers
would
yelp
in
horror
at
us
and
our
enterprise
they
call
it
eh
a
hanging
matter
swindlers
no
swindler
is
english
for
a
convicted
person
yet
the
percentage
of
the
props
and
pillars
of
financial
success
and
mercantile
respectability
who
in
the
and
secrecy
of
their
sleepless
hours
are
honestly
unable
to
recall
to
mind
one
or
more
occasions
when
portland
or
dartmoor
or
simonstown
or
the
kowie
loomed
more
than
near
can
not
be
a
vast
one
which
for
present
purposes
may
be
taken
to
mean
that
if
you
have
got
to
make
money
you
must
make
it
anyhow
or
not
at
all
covering
such
methods
as
are
involved
in
the
conventional
term
if
you
have
got
it
you
can
run
as
straight
as
you
like
we
have
got
it
at
least
not
enough
of
it
yet
and
so
we
are
making
it
and
like
the
rest
of
the
world
making
it
anyhow
there
the
whole
case
in
a
nutshell
stanninghame
why
of
course
but
if
only
we
could
bring
holmes
round
to
that
sensible
standpoint
i
never
could
have
believed
the
fellow
would
turn
out
such
an
ass
i
am
more
than
sorry
hazon
that
i
should
have
influenced
you
to
bring
him
along
oh
holmes
is
young
and
hardly
knows
the
meaning
of
the
term
experience
as
we
know
it
still
in
his
way
he
useful
enough
and
in
a
fight
and
when
he
comes
to
bank
his
share
he
forget
to
feel
over
particular
as
to
how
he
acquired
it
that
mere
ordinary
human
nature
and
holmes
is
far
from
being
an
abnormal
unit
no
but
he
still
affects
a
conscience
what
if
he
goes
back
and
takes
on
that
girl
he
was
smitten
with
and
turning
soft
incontinently
gives
us
away
are
on
the
croak
stanninghame
that
odd
here
how
your
pulse
let
time
it
and
hazon
reached
out
his
hand
well
yes
it
is
unusual
but
it
d
d
hot
and
the
steaminess
of
it
depresses
me
at
times
returned
laurence
with
a
queer
reckless
laugh
he
wo
give
us
away
never
fear
said
hazon
carelessly
he
take
on
that
girl
because
she
have
forgotten
him
long
ago
that
too
being
ordinary
human
nature
and
nobody
ever
did
give
me
away
yet
i
do
somehow
think
anybody
is
ever
likely
to
both
sides
of
this
remark
struck
a
chord
within
laurence
mind
the
first
a
jarring
one
since
it
voiced
a
misgiving
which
had
at
times
assailed
himself
specially
at
such
periods
of
depression
as
this
under
which
he
was
now
suffering
for
the
second
the
tone
was
characteristic
of
the
speaker
and
the
subject
it
seemed
to
flash
forth
more
than
a
menace
in
its
stern
unrelenting
ruthlessness
of
purpose
while
the
words
seemed
to
recall
the
warning
so
darkly
let
fall
by
rainsford
and
others
regarding
his
present
confederate
other
men
have
gone
up
country
with
hazon
but
one
of
them
has
ever
to
himself
the
words
contained
no
menace
he
trusted
hazon
felt
thoroughly
able
to
take
care
of
himself
and
moreover
was
as
little
likely
to
violate
the
secrecy
of
their
enterprise
as
hazon
himself
but
what
of
holmes
with
all
his
hard
callous
unscrupulousness
laurence
had
no
desire
that
harm
should
befall
holmes
in
a
measure
he
felt
responsible
for
him
do
you
worry
about
holmes
said
hazon
as
though
reading
his
thoughts
we
can
put
him
to
all
the
show
part
of
the
business
reserving
the
more
serious
line
for
our
own
immediate
supervision
and
the
time
may
come
when
we
can
do
very
well
with
holmes
in
short
when
three
white
men
may
be
better
than
two
we
are
very
near
the
country
and
an
of
them
on
the
raid
will
give
us
as
much
trouble
as
we
can
do
with
and
i
seen
signs
of
late
which
seem
to
point
that
way
is
it
a
business
this
terror
eh
said
laurence
lazily
puffing
out
rings
of
blue
smoke
which
hung
upon
the
hot
still
atmosphere
as
though
they
never
meant
to
disperse
i
expect
their
strength
is
as
exaggerated
as
their
dash
why
this
part
is
not
altogether
unexplored
yet
there
is
no
record
of
an
exceptionally
strong
tribe
hereabouts
hazon
smiled
pityingly
that
great
god
the
african
explorer
do
know
everything
he
said
no
not
quite
everything
although
he
thinks
he
does
anyway
he
frequently
manages
to
get
a
pretty
idea
of
things
and
places
hereabout
a
muddle
which
the
natives
of
this
land
would
rather
thicken
than
dispel
for
instance
he
will
ask
the
name
of
a
river
or
a
mountain
and
when
the
other
party
to
the
talk
repeats
his
question
as
natives
invariably
do
to
gain
time
for
answering
he
takes
this
for
the
answer
and
forthwith
the
thing
is
dubbed
by
a
word
that
simply
means
or
in
one
or
other
of
the
hundred
and
fifty
tongues
which
prevail
hereabout
no
the
existence
of
the
is
not
chronicled
simply
because
the
explorer
was
fortunate
enough
not
to
fall
in
with
them
had
he
done
so
he
would
probably
never
have
returned
to
chronicle
anything
but
get
one
or
two
of
our
wangoni
to
talk
and
he
may
or
may
not
tell
you
something
about
them
for
the
are
like
the
wangoni
themselves
a
zulu
offshoot
only
far
more
conservative
in
the
old
zulu
traditions
and
of
purer
blood
they
are
a
much
finer
race
indeed
i
believe
them
to
be
as
powerful
and
well
disciplined
as
the
zulus
themselves
were
under
cetywayo
i
was
all
through
the
war
of
you
know
and
that
pretty
scar
i
carry
about
as
an
ornament
represents
the
expiring
effort
of
an
awful
tough
customer
who
had
lost
too
much
blood
to
be
able
to
strike
altogether
home
i
call
it
my
isandhlwana
medal
that
where
you
captured
it
eh
said
laurence
with
interest
for
the
story
was
new
to
him
he
remembered
first
noticing
the
great
scar
upon
hazon
chest
the
day
he
visited
him
when
ill
in
bed
at
johannesburg
but
he
had
never
asked
its
history
indeed
it
was
characteristic
of
the
strange
relations
in
which
these
two
men
stood
to
each
other
that
notwithstanding
all
this
time
of
close
comradeship
neither
should
ever
have
asked
the
other
any
question
of
a
personal
nature
characteristic
too
was
it
of
hazon
method
that
this
piece
of
information
should
have
been
vouchsafed
as
it
was
many
an
experience
strange
and
startling
had
he
narrated
from
time
to
time
but
never
for
the
sake
of
narrating
it
if
anything
occurred
to
bring
it
forth
out
it
would
come
carrying
perhaps
others
in
its
train
but
ever
in
due
sequence
even
holmes
the
impulsive
who
being
young
was
the
man
of
the
trio
had
long
since
learned
that
to
ask
hazon
for
a
yarn
was
the
direct
way
not
to
get
one
out
of
him
yes
went
on
hazon
that
where
i
captured
it
speaking
with
some
experience
isandhlwana
is
the
toughest
thing
that
has
ever
travelled
my
way
and
i
do
hanker
after
any
repetition
of
it
with
people
of
the
spider
why
what
does
this
mean
the
words
quick
hurried
broke
off
on
the
faces
of
both
men
was
a
look
of
keen
anxious
alertness
for
a
wild
and
fierce
clamour
had
suddenly
arisen
and
was
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
loud
swelling
threatening
chapter
xviii
two
perils
just
what
i
feared
said
hazon
calmly
but
with
ever
so
faint
a
glance
at
his
confederate
our
people
are
in
revolt
both
men
rose
to
their
feet
but
leisurely
and
turned
to
confront
the
approaching
tumult
and
formidable
enough
this
was
the
wangoni
advanced
in
a
compact
mass
beating
their
shields
with
their
yelling
in
concert
a
shrill
harsh
into
which
they
had
managed
to
import
an
indescribable
note
of
defiance
announcing
their
intention
of
returning
to
eat
up
those
they
had
so
weakly
spared
the
previous
day
on
either
side
of
them
came
the
arab
and
swahili
element
in
silence
however
but
a
silence
which
was
no
less
ominous
than
their
sullen
and
scowling
looks
and
the
almost
significant
gestures
wherewith
they
handled
their
rifles
what
do
they
want
lutali
said
hazon
turning
to
the
arab
who
with
holmes
had
just
joined
the
pair
but
lutali
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
his
features
scarce
moved
then
he
said
who
may
think
to
strive
against
the
hand
of
allah
and
that
of
his
prophet
yon
foul
dogs
even
they
so
great
is
the
mercy
of
allah
even
they
might
have
been
turned
into
good
moslemia
even
as
other
such
have
been
before
them
yet
we
we
have
left
them
to
wallow
in
the
mire
of
their
cannibal
abominations
our
people
are
not
satisfied
el
khanac
and
they
fear
that
ill
may
come
of
it
a
magnificent
and
comfortable
hypocrisy
that
said
laurence
in
english
such
combination
of
and
is
unique
then
in
swahili
but
what
do
they
want
lutali
they
want
to
set
right
the
error
of
yesterday
but
the
wangoni
do
care
a
grain
of
rice
for
allah
and
his
prophet
he
went
on
why
then
are
dissatisfied
they
are
instruments
in
the
hands
of
those
who
do
it
is
so
written
allah
is
great
who
may
call
in
question
his
decrees
replied
the
arab
in
the
same
level
monotone
let
the
people
do
their
will
which
is
also
the
will
of
allah
during
this
conversation
the
whole
party
had
halted
and
now
stood
in
a
great
semicircle
around
the
white
leaders
then
mashumbwe
spoke
and
his
words
though
fairly
courteous
managed
to
cover
an
extremely
defiant
tone
our
people
are
dissatisfied
father
he
said
addressing
hazon
they
desire
to
return
home
wherefore
asked
hazon
shortly
they
came
forth
to
up
other
tribes
not
to
spare
such
they
are
dissatisfied
they
better
have
their
own
way
muttered
hazon
in
english
you
are
sacrificing
all
we
have
done
and
obtained
this
trip
to
an
empty
whim
how
does
that
pan
out
stanninghame
i
hate
to
go
back
on
my
word
was
the
reply
still
more
to
be
bullied
into
it
well
said
declared
holmes
warmly
the
insurgents
reading
the
expression
upon
the
countenances
of
these
two
broke
forth
into
tumult
once
more
groans
and
mutterings
arose
among
the
arab
contingent
while
the
wangoni
uttered
wild
laughing
whoops
of
defiance
nothing
would
be
easier
than
to
slay
the
white
leaders
a
single
volley
would
lay
them
low
the
position
was
critical
perilous
to
a
degree
we
go
then
cried
mashumbwe
waving
his
hand
fare
ye
well
el
khanac
afà
fare
ye
well
but
before
his
followers
could
form
into
marching
rank
several
men
rushed
from
the
forest
with
every
appearance
of
importance
and
alarm
making
straight
to
where
stood
their
white
leaders
they
began
hurriedly
to
confer
with
the
latter
your
discontent
was
needless
cried
hazon
after
a
minute
or
two
of
such
conference
turning
to
his
rebellious
followers
the
whole
body
of
whom
had
now
paused
to
learn
what
tidings
these
had
brought
your
discontent
comes
a
day
too
late
those
whom
we
spared
have
even
now
been
eaten
up
and
their
village
given
over
to
the
flames
the
short
sharp
gasp
of
amazement
which
greeted
this
announcement
gave
place
to
growls
of
renewed
discontent
some
rival
band
of
had
fallen
upon
the
village
and
taken
that
which
they
themselves
had
so
weakly
left
such
was
their
first
thought
the
have
found
them
continued
hazon
calmly
if
there
had
been
marvel
before
in
the
ejaculation
now
there
was
more
there
was
even
a
note
of
dismay
forgetting
their
mutinous
intentions
now
all
crowded
around
their
white
leaders
eager
to
learn
full
particulars
and
in
that
moment
laurence
ever
observant
was
not
slow
to
perceive
both
in
the
looks
and
tones
of
the
party
quite
enough
to
confirm
all
that
hazon
had
said
as
to
the
terror
inspired
by
the
very
name
of
the
redoubtable
even
the
savage
and
truculent
wangoni
seemed
for
the
moment
overawed
it
was
striking
too
how
in
the
hour
of
impending
peril
all
turned
to
the
white
leaders
whom
a
moment
before
they
had
been
entirely
defying
and
more
than
half
threatening
the
are
in
great
force
went
on
hazon
as
calmly
as
though
he
were
merely
announcing
the
proximity
of
one
more
defenceless
and
village
we
shall
have
to
fight
and
that
hard
but
not
here
we
must
fight
them
in
the
open
a
murmur
of
assent
went
up
every
head
was
craned
forward
eager
to
hear
more
briefly
and
concisely
hazon
set
forth
his
commands
their
then
encampment
was
situate
on
the
edge
of
the
forest
belt
beyond
the
latter
the
country
stretched
away
in
vast
treeless
plains
now
a
peculiar
feature
of
these
plains
was
the
frequent
recurrence
of
abrupt
granite
at
first
glance
not
unlike
moorland
tors
but
more
than
one
of
them
when
arrived
at
wore
the
aspect
of
a
complete
druidical
ring
a
circle
of
stones
crowning
the
rise
with
a
slight
depression
of
ground
within
the
centre
one
of
these
hazon
who
had
been
over
the
ground
before
resolved
should
serve
them
as
a
natural
fortress
whence
to
resist
the
fierce
and
formidable
foe
now
advancing
against
them
with
surprising
readiness
the
march
began
loads
were
shouldered
and
slaves
yoked
together
extra
firmly
those
who
were
too
weak
to
keep
up
the
pace
treble
that
of
the
normal
one
at
which
they
were
hurried
forward
were
ruthlessly
speared
but
whether
they
were
slain
by
their
captors
or
by
the
pitiless
mattered
but
little
the
which
hazon
had
selected
was
situated
about
four
miles
from
the
forest
belt
no
better
natural
fortress
could
have
been
chosen
for
it
consisted
of
a
complete
circle
of
low
rocks
of
about
two
hundred
yards
diameter
and
commanded
an
open
sweep
of
at
least
a
mile
on
every
side
laurence
and
holmes
were
loud
in
their
admiration
and
interest
these
are
old
craters
i
reckon
said
hazon
not
volcanic
but
this
plain
you
notice
is
considerably
below
the
level
of
the
forest
country
depend
upon
it
the
thing
was
once
a
big
swamp
with
great
boiling
bubbling
no
time
was
it
however
for
speculations
of
a
scientific
nature
and
accordingly
the
leaders
proceeded
to
dispose
their
lines
of
defence
this
was
soon
done
for
the
three
white
men
and
lutali
had
arranged
all
that
during
the
march
the
wangoni
were
of
no
great
use
save
in
pursuit
of
a
defeated
enemy
they
could
hardly
have
hit
a
haystack
once
in
six
shots
nor
did
hazon
care
to
intrust
with
firearms
such
a
turbulent
and
unruly
crew
but
the
slavers
were
all
fair
marksmen
some
indeed
among
them
lutali
being
not
far
short
of
dead
shots
these
were
disposed
around
the
circle
of
rocks
so
as
to
form
a
ring
of
fire
and
the
rocks
themselves
were
heightened
wherever
necessary
with
some
of
the
loads
or
with
such
piles
of
loose
stones
as
could
be
collected
in
time
the
part
allotted
to
the
wangoni
was
that
of
a
reserve
force
in
the
event
of
the
enemy
carrying
any
given
point
and
thus
necessitating
conflict
the
slaves
firmly
secured
were
placed
in
the
center
of
the
great
circle
hardly
were
these
dispositions
complete
than
a
cry
of
astonishment
of
warning
arose
far
away
over
the
forest
country
somewhat
to
the
right
and
left
of
the
route
the
party
had
been
pursuing
several
columns
of
smoke
could
be
seen
mounting
to
the
heavens
there
were
other
villages
then
besides
the
one
spared
and
now
the
spreading
over
the
land
in
their
immense
might
were
firing
all
such
and
massacring
the
inhabitants
many
and
various
were
the
comments
which
arose
as
the
party
gazed
intently
upon
the
distant
smoke
columns
if
only
as
a
change
from
knocking
on
the
head
these
defenceless
devils
it
quite
a
blessed
relief
to
have
some
real
fighting
quoth
holmes
you
get
plenty
of
that
holmes
within
the
next
few
hours
remarked
hazon
dryly
it
was
near
midday
and
the
heat
was
torrid
and
sweltering
the
fierce
vertical
seemed
to
pour
down
upon
their
unshaded
position
as
in
streams
of
molten
fire
even
the
quick
excited
murmurs
of
the
men
grew
languid
and
having
seen
to
all
being
in
complete
readiness
as
laurence
stanninghame
sat
there
at
his
post
in
the
torrid
heat
smoking
the
pipe
of
meditation
did
no
thought
of
the
home
such
as
it
was
but
which
he
would
probably
never
see
again
not
rise
up
before
him
if
it
did
it
was
only
to
confirm
him
in
the
conviction
that
the
present
position
of
peril
whose
chances
he
at
any
rate
was
in
no
disposition
to
was
the
preferable
of
the
two
here
freedom
activity
adventure
there
galling
bondage
stagnation
a
ceasing
to
live
yes
that
time
indeed
seemed
very
very
far
away
he
felt
no
shadow
of
inclination
towards
a
recurrence
thereof
then
suddenly
with
magical
swiftness
the
whole
party
was
astir
and
it
needed
a
sharp
hurried
command
or
two
from
hazon
and
lutali
to
restrain
some
from
leaping
on
the
rocks
in
order
to
obtain
a
better
view
of
what
had
caused
the
alarm
between
the
and
the
forest
belt
the
ground
save
for
an
occasional
roll
was
entirely
visible
now
swarming
out
into
the
open
came
masses
of
moving
figures
fleeing
figures
hazon
and
laurence
who
each
possessed
a
powerful
glass
were
able
to
master
the
situation
in
a
twinkling
close
on
the
rear
of
the
fugitives
pressed
another
multitude
to
the
naked
eye
like
myriad
ants
upon
the
far
plain
but
to
those
who
scanned
them
through
the
powerful
glasses
all
detail
was
vividly
distinct
the
lines
and
lines
of
tufted
shields
the
gleam
of
spear
blades
the
streaming
feather
and
adornments
and
now
the
hum
and
roar
of
the
wild
onslaught
and
pursuit
grows
momentarily
louder
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
a
great
cloud
of
dust
is
whirling
onward
and
athwart
it
the
gleam
of
steel
rising
and
falling
the
distant
as
the
miserable
fugitives
fall
ripped
hacked
to
fragments
by
their
ferocious
pursuers
and
still
the
terrible
wave
pours
on
this
is
going
to
be
a
hard
business
muttered
laurence
between
his
set
teeth
how
many
do
you
size
them
up
at
hazon
twenty
thousand
rather
more
than
less
that
just
how
people
came
on
at
isandhlwana
only
there
they
took
us
more
by
surprise
well
we
not
a
lot
of
soldiers
here
anyway
to
scatter
all
over
the
veldt
if
they
take
this
position
they
have
to
rush
it
and
rush
it
hard
well
do
you
believe
in
the
now
stanninghame
save
a
nod
the
other
makes
no
answer
and
now
the
attention
of
both
men
is
upon
the
scene
before
them
some
few
of
the
fugitives
in
the
desperation
of
their
terror
are
gradually
outstripping
their
pursuers
against
these
whole
flights
of
casting
spears
are
launched
amid
roaring
shouts
of
bass
laughter
finally
the
last
one
falls
and
now
the
array
of
the
enemy
is
but
half
a
mile
distant
from
the
slaver
position
far
over
the
plain
in
immense
crescent
formation
the
barbarian
host
sweeps
on
now
in
dead
silence
not
hesitating
a
moment
for
the
spoor
left
by
the
slavers
is
broad
and
easy
now
it
can
be
seen
that
these
warriors
are
of
splendid
physique
most
of
them
are
nearly
naked
save
for
their
flowing
of
hair
or
many
are
crowned
with
towering
ostrich
plumes
both
black
and
white
others
wear
balls
of
feathers
surmounted
by
the
scarlet
tuft
of
the
egret
some
again
have
round
their
heads
bands
of
the
hide
of
the
spotted
cat
but
all
flaunt
some
wild
and
fantastic
adornment
and
the
great
hide
shields
with
their
facings
and
tufted
tops
are
zulu
shields
and
the
broad
stabbing
spear
is
the
zulu
or
assegai
there
is
a
lurid
fascination
in
gazing
upon
the
awful
splendour
of
this
fierce
and
formidable
which
set
even
laurence
stanninghame
schooled
nerves
tingling
as
for
holmes
he
could
hardly
remain
still
in
his
excitement
but
in
hazon
piercing
eyes
there
was
a
glow
in
which
the
lust
of
combat
despair
of
success
and
the
most
indomitable
resolve
were
about
equally
intermingled
the
countenance
of
lutali
betrayed
no
change
whatever
the
bulk
of
the
were
scowling
and
eager
but
the
miserable
slaves
realizing
that
massacre
awaited
them
were
moaning
and
trembling
with
fear
under
the
they
held
their
lives
at
any
rate
but
should
the
enemy
without
win
the
day
why
then
they
would
taste
the
steel
in
common
with
their
present
oppressors
the
never
spared
now
the
of
the
latter
underwent
a
change
from
each
end
of
the
great
crescent
horns
shot
out
extending
farther
and
farther
still
the
numbers
of
the
main
body
seemed
in
no
wise
to
diminish
the
mound
was
encircled
by
a
wall
of
living
men
then
the
silence
was
rent
asunder
and
that
in
most
appalling
fashion
from
twenty
thousand
fierce
throats
in
concert
went
up
the
horrible
terrifying
combining
the
frenzied
roars
of
a
legion
of
maniacs
with
the
snarls
and
baying
of
hounds
tearing
down
their
prey
one
there
had
heard
it
before
but
not
in
such
awful
volume
as
this
and
then
with
heads
bent
shields
thrust
forward
broad
spears
in
strong
ready
grip
the
whole
circle
of
the
host
came
surging
up
the
slope

flung
high
in

and
dark
bodies
leaping
fall
forward
upon
their

to
be

into

as

tread
them
down

them

steadily
and
low
as
before
but
no

his
followers
growl
a
ready
assent
they
are
unmitigated
ruffians
but
terrible
and
determined
fighters
the
fanatical
fatalism
of
the

renders
them

impervious

come
to

each
other
striving
to
hew
their
way
through
their
own
ranks
in
their
endeavours
to
escape
beyond
the
reach
of
that
awful
and
destructive
fire
give
it
to
them
again
growls
hazon
a
lurid
gleam
in
his
piercing
eyes
but
aim
low
aim
low
again
not
a
shot
is
thrown
away
that
side
of
the
savage
host
falls
back
hurriedly
leaving
the
ground
bestrewn
with
bodies
dead
dying
crushed
a
perfect
storm
of
exultant
cheers
greets
this
move
but
if
a
temporary
retreat
it
is
no
rout
in
obedience
to
a
whistling
signal
fully
of
the
main
body
swings
round
and
hurls
itself
with
incredible
force
and
fury
upon
another
point
of
the
seemingly
the
weakest
point
for
here
the
rocks
are
low
and
apart
and
have
to
be
supplemented
with
bags
and
bales
laurence
stanninghame
is
in
command
here
and
now
his
dark
face
flushes
with
the
glow
of
a
mad
excitement
a
perfectly
transforming
exhilaration
he
would
thunder
his
commands
aloud
but
that
a
deadly
coolness
is
as
indispensable
almost
as
accuracy
of
aim
his
orders
are
the
same
as
hazon
and
uttered
as
calmly
but
for
a
suppressed
tremor
and
as
audibly
the
very
earth
seems
to
rock
and
reel
beneath
the
detonating
roll
of
the
volleys
the
thunderous
rumble
of
charging
feet
the
dark
glaring
faces
of
warring
demons
the
flinging
aloft
of
shields
the
groaning
and
yells
the
redness
of
the
sheeting
flames
all
this
renders
him
mad
mad
with
the
revel
of
conflict
with
the
herculean
determination
which
is
sublime
above
death
here
again
whole
lines
of
the
enemy
are
down
here
again
those
in
front
would
draw
back
if
they
could
but
the
immense
weight
behind
hurls
them
on
it
is
the
work
of
but
very
few
moments
and
now
the
whole
of
the
host
is
circling
around
the
position
every
now
and
again
making
a
furious
rush
upon
what
seems
a
weak
point
of
the
defences
but
the
defenders
have
a
way
of
massing
upon
each
point
thus
attacked
and
that
with
a
celerity
which
is
truly
marvellous
and
the
result
is
the
same
yet
with
each
repulse
the
terrible
ranks
leap
forward
immediately
and
every
such
charge
brings
them
nearer
than
the
last
moreover
as
each
of
their
fighting
leaders
is
picked
off
another
springs
forward
with
unparalleled
intrepidity
to
take
his
place
the
while
the
barking
roar
of
their
terrific
slogan
rends
the
air
in
its
most
demoniacal
clamour
now
an
idea
takes
hold
on
the
minds
of
these
ferocious
legionaries
and
it
is
passed
like
lightning
round
the
ranks
those
in
the
forefront
haul
up
the
bodies
of
the
slain
and
holding
them
to
them
stagger
forward
thinking
to
make
a
buckler
of
the
dead
for
the
living
but
the
terrible
rifles
of
the
slavers
drive
their
unerring
missiles
at
that
short
range
through
dead
and
living
alike
and
corpse
is
heaped
upon
corpse
in
ghastly
intertwining
in
the
thickest
of
the
tumult
hazon
is
here
there
everywhere
directing
encouraging
restraining
but
for
the
in
the
black
eyes
staring
from
the
pale
set
face
the
man
might
have
been
made
of
marble
so
little
trace
of
emotion
of
any
kind
does
he
display
laurence
too
is
wary
and
though
getting
in
here
and
there
a
telling
shot
holmes
on
the
other
hand
is
firing
away
as
fast
as
he
can
load
so
far
not
a
man
has
been
injured
the
assailants
are
not
quite
within
distance
yet
ammunition
hold
out
oh
yes
we
have
plenty
of
that
is
hazon
reply
to
a
rapid
query
on
the
part
of
laurence
but
it
time
they
turned
tail
isandhlwana
was
nothing
to
this
but
now
with
a
deafening
vibrating
roar
the
massing
suddenly
hurl
fully
of
their
force
upon
the
point
directed
by
lutali
they
surge
up
the
slope
in
one
dense
charge
of
lightning
swiftness
bullets
are
hailed
upon
them
they
waver
not
the
hands
of
the
defenders
are
skinned
and
blistered
by
contact
with
the
breeches
of
their
own
rifles
so
hot
have
these
become
through
quick
firing
and
still
the
firing
is
not
quick
enough
stumbling
leaping
flying
over
the
defences
they
come
a
great
cloud
of
dark
grim
faces
and
bared
teeth
and
protruding
eyeballs
they
spring
upon
the
defences
then
over
them
the
whole
might
of
the
redoubtable
foe
is
pouring
into
the
natural
fortress
illustration
stumbling
leaping
flying
over
the
defences
they
come
now
ensues
a
scene
the
like
of
which
might
be
paralleled
but
hardly
surpassed
by
some
lurid
drama
of
hell
in
jarring
shock
they
meet
those
within
and
those
till
now
without
the
savage
legionaries
of
the
spider
and
the
no
less
savage
and
equally
determined
the
wangoni
seeing
their
chance
have
sprung
forward
to
meet
and
roll
back
the
assailants
but
they
themselves
are
beaten
down
by
the
broad
shields
ripped
with
the
terrible
stabbing
spears
of
the
ferocious
now
maddened
to
assuage
their
and
whose
crushing
might
now
pouring
over
in
countless
numbers
this
handful
shall
never
hope
to
resist
the
chief
mashumbwe
is
speared
and
ripped
the
struggle
is
fierce
and
but
short
the
wangoni
now
a
sorry
remnant
are
rolled
back
upon
their
allies
of
these
not
a
man
but
knows
that
the
day
is
lost
that
flight
is
impossible
that
if
the
other
half
of
the
host
has
not
swarmed
over
to
take
them
on
the
rear
it
is
only
because
it
is
waiting
to
receive
on
its
spear
points
all
who
flee
but
there
is
no
thought
of
flight
with
all
their
indifference
to
human
suffering
with
all
their
brutality
their
savagery
the
slavers
are
as
brave
as
any
they
are
indeed
men
picked
for
their
desperate
courage
and
now
standing
back
to
back
they
begin
to
render
the
victory
of
the
a
dearly
bought
one
indeed
the
no
longer
rends
the
air
there
is
a
grim
fell
silence
in
this
conflict
broken
only
by
the
hiss
of
the
as
an
enemy
goes
down
by
the
slap
and
shock
of
shield
meeting
clubbed
gun
or
stabbing
knife
by
the
gasps
of
the
combatants
the
cloud
of
powder
smoke
hanging
overhead
partially
veils
the
sun
which
glowers
a
ball
through
this
gloomy
shroud
the
whole
space
within
the
is
a
very
of
corpses
among
which
the
combatants
stagger
victorious
and
vanquished
alike
stagger
and
slip
on
a
foothold
of
oozy
gore
stab
and
strike
and
fall
in
their
turn
in
the
rush
and
the
laurence
stanninghame
has
become
separated
even
farther
from
his
comrades
his
white
comrades
that
is
nor
can
he
by
any
effort
hope
to
rejoin
them
several
arabs
are
around
him
his
own
followers
swarthy
sons
of
the
prophet
their
keen
eyes
flashing
hate
and
defiance
upon
the
foe
their
long
ataghans
sweeping
a
circle
of
light
around
them
in
their
forefront
is
lutali
lutali
whirling
a
great
scimitar
hewing
down
more
than
one
of
the
too
venturesome
and
that
in
spite
of
the
broad
shield
deftly
wielded
lutali
uttering
a
his
erect
form
and
keen
haughty
face
the
very
personification
of
absolute
and
dauntless
valour
and
he
himself
wedged
in
by
those
around
can
still
get
in
now
and
again
a
telling
shot
from
his
revolver
and
with
every
such
shot
one
more
warrior
of
the
spider
has
uttered
his
last
battle
cry
no
there
is
no
hope
swift
as
lightning
a
mighty
surges
through
laurence
mind
and
in
it
he
sees
the
whole
of
his
past
life
yet
not
even
this
dismays
him
rather
does
it
engender
a
sort
of
exultation
life
for
him
has
been
such
a
mistake
and
that
not
through
any
fault
of
his
own
it
held
no
especial
charm
for
him
all
its
sweetness
has
been
concentrated
within
one
short
idyllic
period
but
even
that
could
not
have
lasted
even
to
it
would
have
come
disillusionment
lilith
would
never
learn
his
fate
it
and
that
of
those
with
him
would
vanish
as
others
had
done
into
the
mysteries
of
this
great
mysterious
continent
all
this
and
more
so
is
the
power
of
thought
passes
through
laurence
stanninghame
brain
at
this
dread
and
awful
moment
a
casting
spear
strikes
him
on
the
left
shoulder
penetrating
the
flesh
infuriated
by
the
sharp
sickening
pang
he
discharges
his
revolver
at
the
supposed
thrower
but
his
aim
is
uncertain
again
he
draws
trigger
the
hammer
falls
with
a
harmless
click
the
chambers
are
empty
and
now
hard
pressed
by
the
yelling
those
of
his
followers
yet
between
him
and
the
enemy
stagger
back
fighting
furiously
while
the
wells
from
many
a
gashed
and
gaping
wound
no
longer
can
he
see
either
hazon
or
holmes
for
the
forest
of
waving
reeking
spear
blades
then
one
of
his
own
followers
a
hulking
swahili
mortally
wounded
reels
and
falls
and
doing
so
bears
back
laurence
beneath
his
ponderous
weight
the
is
immediately
behind
him
and
is
low
here
it
catches
the
back
of
his
knees
and
now
having
lost
all
control
over
his
balance
grasping
at
empty
air
in
wild
effort
to
recover
himself
laurence
pitches
heavily
backward
over
the
rocks
and
lies
half
stunned
upon
the
plain
without
those
of
the
host
in
waiting
on
that
side
surge
tumultuously
forward
uttering
yells
of
savage
delight
this
is
the
first
of
the
doomed
slavers
who
has
come
over
and
he
a
white
man
and
of
course
a
leader
each
warrior
is
eager
to
bury
his
in
this
body
and
they
crowd
around
him
every
right
hand
raised
aloft
for
the
downward
stroke
but
the
fatal
stroke
remains
undealt
broad
blades
quiver
aloft
in
a
ring
of
steel
each
grim
bloodthirsty
countenance
is
set
and
staring
stony
in
its
indescribable
expression
of
mingled
marvel
and
awe
and
eyeballs
seem
to
start
from
their
sockets
as
their
owners
stand
gazing
down
upon
this
prostrate
white
man
then
from
each
broad
chest
a
gasp
bursts
forth
the
sign
the
sign
of
the
spider
chapter
xx
to
what
end
the
sign
of
the
spider
laurence
stanninghame
lying
there
his
faculties
half
dazed
by
the
shock
of
his
fall
and
the
pain
of
his
wound
hearing
the
words
uttered
as
they
were
in
pure
zulu
almost
persuaded
himself
that
the
terrible
events
of
that
day
had
been
a
dream
but
no
it
was
real
enough
his
eyes
took
in
the
sea
of
grim
dark
faces
pressing
forward
to
gaze
upon
him
the
sign
of
the
spider
what
did
it
what
could
it
mean
that
it
should
be
to
stay
those
devouring
spears
to
avert
from
him
the
grisly
death
of
blood
whose
bitterness
even
then
was
already
past
then
as
for
the
first
time
he
suffered
his
glance
to
follow
the
direction
of
theirs
he
saw
a
strange
thing
the
metal
box
had
come
forth
either
jerked
from
its
during
his
fall
or
unconsciously
plucked
thence
by
his
own
hand
in
the
last
moment
of
his
extremity
and
now
still
secured
by
the
steel
chain
it
lay
upon
his
breast
and
oh
marvel
of
marvels
gazing
thus
upon
it
focussed
by
his
eyelids
and
confused
senses
the
straggling
monogram
with
its
quaint
turns
and
flourishes
lying
brown
upon
the
more
shining
metal
seemed
to
take
exactly
the
form
and
aspect
of
a
great
sprawling
tarantula
the
sign
of
the
spider
had
been
their
cry
and
these
were
the
people
of
the
spider
what
magic
what
mystery
was
this
lilith
last
gift
lilith
image
even
her
very
name
it
had
indeed
acted
as
a
talisman
as
a
charm
to
stand
between
him
and
the
most
deadly
of
peril
as
her
aspiration
had
worded
it
verily
again
had
lilith
love
availed
to
stand
between
himself
and
a
swift
sure
and
bloody
death
a
marvel
and
a
stupendous
one
all
this
flashed
through
his
mind
as
the
crowded
up
around
him
the
hubbub
of
their
excited
voices
sinking
into
an
awestruck
murmur
as
they
gazed
upon
the
man
who
wore
the
sign
of
the
spider
no
wonder
this
man
should
have
come
forth
alive
from
the
ring
of
death
they
decided
he
alone
wearing
that
sign
and
he
alone
had
come
forth
all
sounds
of
conflict
had
now
ceased
giving
way
to
the
exultant
shouts
and
bass
laughter
of
the
victorious
savages
looting
the
property
of
the
slavers
not
a
man
was
left
alive
up
there
laurence
knew
only
too
well
he
alone
was
spared
as
the
bearer
of
that
mysterious
sign
was
spared
miraculously
indeed
but
to
what
end
now
he
became
conscious
of
a
movement
among
the
crowd
which
parted
quickly
respectfully
through
the
opening
thus
effected
there
advanced
two
men
both
were
fine
tall
warriors
elderly
of
aspect
for
their
short
crisp
beards
were
turning
gray
but
apparently
in
the
very
prime
of
athletic
strength
and
vigour
in
outward
adornment
their
appearance
differed
little
from
that
of
the
bulk
of
the
their
shaven
heads
were
surmounted
by
the
or
ring
exactly
after
the
zulu
fashion
and
on
either
side
of
this
but
fastened
so
as
not
to
interfere
with
it
nodded
a
tuft
of
magnificent
white
ostrich
plumes
laurence
who
had
now
raised
himself
to
a
sitting
posture
felt
no
doubt
but
that
in
these
he
beheld
the
two
principal
of
the
army
who
art
thou
stranger
who
wearest
the
sign
of
the
spider
began
one
of
these
in
pure
zulu
after
gazing
upon
him
for
a
moment
in
silence
laurence
at
first
thought
to
affect
ignorance
of
the
language
of
which
indeed
he
possessed
considerable
knowledge
he
would
the
more
readily
get
at
their
plans
and
intentions
that
way
but
then
it
occurred
to
him
he
could
hardly
sustain
his
character
as
one
to
be
favoured
of
the
people
of
the
spider
if
professing
an
ignorance
of
their
tongue
and
he
intended
to
work
that
fortunate
incident
for
all
it
would
carry
so
he
replied
courteously
you
see
me
father
i
alone
am
alive
of
those
who
fought
up
yonder
even
the
spear
which
would
slay
me
refused
its
work
it
was
turned
aside
showing
the
wound
in
his
shoulder
of
which
he
realized
he
must
make
light
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
giving
him
considerable
pain
a
deep
murmur
from
the
vast
and
increasing
audience
convinced
the
speaker
that
he
had
scored
a
point
in
making
this
statement
the
chief
continued
rest
now
while
we
rest
o
stranger
and
eat
for
the
way
is
far
which
lies
before
us
and
whither
does
that
way
lie
o
brave
ones
who
command
the
valiant
asked
laurence
where
dwelleth
the
strong
wind
that
burns
from
the
north
and
with
this
darkly
enigmatical
rejoinder
the
speaker
and
his
brother
chief
turned
away
as
a
sign
that
the
conference
need
proceed
no
further
at
present
some
of
those
who
had
heard
now
beckoned
laurence
forward
and
as
he
moved
among
that
terrible
host
many
and
strange
were
the
glances
which
were
cast
at
him
he
for
his
part
was
not
unmoved
this
was
an
experience
clean
outside
any
he
had
ever
known
the
might
and
stature
of
these
formidable
warriors
lingering
around
in
immense
groups
many
of
them
bleeding
from
ghastly
wounds
yet
devouring
the
dried
food
they
carried
the
while
comrades
were
treating
their
hurts
after
a
fashion
which
would
have
caused
the
civilized
being
to
shriek
aloud
with
agony
the
ferocious
volubility
wherewith
they
discussed
and
fought
the
battle
over
again
and
away
beyond
their
lines
the
earth
black
with
corpses
of
the
slain
while
up
yonder
though
this
he
could
not
see
the
rock
circle
was
literally
piled
with
those
who
had
been
his
friends
or
followers
for
many
a
long
day
all
this
impressed
him
to
an
extent
which
he
had
hardly
deemed
possible
though
of
any
outward
evidence
thereof
he
gave
no
sign
are
all
dead
up
yonder
he
asked
some
of
the
as
he
joined
them
in
their
frugal
fare
a
laugh
derisive
but
not
discourteous
to
himself
greeted
the
question
the
bite
of
the
spider
does
not
need
repeating
twice
was
the
reply
none
who
have
once
felt

now
the
solitary
white
man
in
its

he
himself
was
hardly
certain
which
had
an
opportunity
of
admiring
the
stern
and
iron
discipline
of
this
splendid
army
of
savages

of

the

forth

laurence
stanninghame
feelings
were
passing
strange
as
he
found
himself
thus
carried
captive
he
knew
not
whither
by
this
mighty
nation
which
had
hitherto
been
to
him
but
a
name
as
to
whose
very
existence
he
had
been
until
quite
recently
more
than
half
sceptical
hazon
had
not
exaggerated
its
strength
or
prowess
no
not
one
whit
of
that
he
had
had
abundant
testimony
and
hazon
himself
that
strange
individual
with
his
personality
his
ruthlessness
and
dauntless
courage
well
his
career
was
done
he
lay
in
yonder
circle
buried
beneath
the
slain
fighting
to
the
last
with
fierce
and
consistent
valour
and
holmes
even
laurence
hardened
nature
felt
soft
as
he
thought
of
the
comrade
with
whom
he
had
been
so
closely
linked
during
these
years
of
lawless
and
perilous
enterprise
well
they
were
gone
and
he
was
spared
but
to
what
end
then
the
spirit
of
the
true
adventurer
reasserted
itself
what
lay
before
him
what
were
the
chances
opening
out
to
him
in
the
dim
unknown
land
whither
they
were
speeding
you
will
return
wealthy
or
you
will
not
return
at
all
had
been
hazon
words
and
now
their
utterer
would
utter
no
more
words
of
any
kind
but
he
laurence
would
he
return
at
all
would
he
and
now
as
they
gained
the
edge
of
the
great
plain
the
whole
raised
a
mighty
improvised
to
celebrate
their
triumph
its
fierce
strophes
rolled
like
thunder
along
the
ranks
to
the
tread
of
marching
feet
and
the
multitude
of
hide
shields
dappled
the
plain
far
and
near
and
the
wavy
lines
of
flashed
and
sparkled
in
the
sunlight
and
already
over
the
wizard
ring
of
the
rock
circle
piled
with
its
slain
immense
clouds
of
vultures
were
wheeling
beneath
the
blue
vault
or
swooping
down
upon
their
abundant
feast
and
the
sun
flaming
down
upon
the
torrid
earth
seemed
to
shed
a
pitiless
brassy
glare
upon
this
awful
hecatomb
whose
annals
should
ever
remain
unrecorded
swallowed
up
in
the
grim
and
gloomy
mysteries
of
that
region
of
cruelty
and
of
blood
for
many
days
thus
they
journeyed
making
rapid
but
not
forced
marches
the
aspect
of
the
country
too
varied
open
wavy
plains
where
giraffe
and
buffalo
were
plentiful
and
were
hunted
in
great
numbers
for
the
supply
of
the
then
gloomy
forest
tracts
which
seemed
to
depress
the
who
hurried
through
them
with
all
possible
speed
broad
rivers
too
swarming
with
crocodiles
and
hippopotami
and
these
the
warriors
would
dash
through
in
a
mass
making
the
most
hideous
yelling
and
splashing
but
even
the
ground
seemed
gradually
to
ascend
and
certain
white
peaks
for
some
time
visible
on
the
far
sky
line
were
drawing
nearer
growing
larger
with
every
march
it
may
seem
strange
how
readily
laurence
stanninghame
adapted
himself
to
this
new
turn
in
the
tide
of
his
affairs
and
indeed
now
and
again
he
would
faintly
wonder
at
it
himself
he
had
fought
against
these
formidable
savages
in
the
most
determined
and
bloody
conflict
that
had
ever
befallen
his
lot
or
in
all
probability
ever
would
again
they
had
overwhelmed
and
massacred
his
comrades
and
whole
following
sparing
himself
alone
and
that
by
a
miracle
and
now
not
only
was
he
subjected
to
no
or
indignity
but
moved
freely
among
them
and
was
even
suffered
to
retain
his
arms
yet
there
was
a
sort
of
about
most
of
them
in
which
he
thought
to
descry
a
mingling
of
awe
and
repulsion
now
and
again
however
a
thought
would
occur
to
him
a
thought
productive
of
a
cold
shiver
to
what
end
was
he
thus
spared
was
it
to
be
sacrificed
in
some
hideous
and
gruesome
rite
the
thought
was
not
a
pleasant
one
and
it
would
intrude
more
and
more
the
hot
african
glow
the
adventurous
life
replete
with
every
phase
of
weird
and
depressing
incident
had
strangely
affected
this
man
temperament
with
all
his
coolness
in
emergencies
his
readiness
of
resource
in
times
of
rest
he
would
grow
moody
and
a
sort
of
surcharged
mesmeric
property
seemed
to
hold
him
at
such
times
and
he
would
wonder
whether
the
hideous
experiences
and
iron
which
he
had
passed
through
of
late
had
not
begun
unknown
to
himself
actually
to
affect
his
brain
now
during
the
heat
of
the
midday
halt
he
would
withdraw
and
sit
alone
by
the
hour
contemplating
the
metal
box
and
at
times
its
contents
more
and
more
since
his
wonderful
escape
was
it
assuming
in
his
eyes
the
properties
of
an
amulet
or
charm
it
would
reassure
him
too
what
time
unpleasant
thoughts
would
weigh
upon
him
as
to
the
end
to
which
he
had
been
reserved
twice
had
lilith
love
stood
between
him
and
death
would
it
not
again
in
truth
the
metal
box
was
a
possession
beyond
price
all
unconsciously
his
frequent
and
rapt
contemplation
of
this
object
was
standing
him
in
valuable
stead
the
furtively
beholding
him
thus
engaged
for
he
was
never
beyond
their
watchful
gaze
were
strengthened
in
their
belief
that
he
was
a
magician
of
the
spider
and
feared
him
the
more
he
was
thus
unconsciously
keeping
up
his
character
as
such
yet
vivid
as
recollection
was
as
conjured
up
by
the
metal
box
in
other
respects
the
old
life
seemed
far
away
as
a
dream
misty
shadowy
vanishing
all
its
old
conventionalities
its
abstract
notions
of
right
and
wrong
what
were
they
dust
even
now
whither
was
he
wending
would
he
ever
again
behold
a
white
face
it
might
be
never
have
no
white
people
ever
visited
your
country
silawayo
he
said
one
day
while
he
and
the
two
were
talking
together
during
the
march
one
only
was
the
reply
given
with
a
shade
of
hesitation
and
what
became
of
him
he
went
to
well
he
went
answered
the
chief
with
a
curious
look
the
reply
smote
upon
laurence
with
a
cold
fear
what
grim
and
gruesome
form
of
mysterious
doom
did
it
not
point
to
one
only
silawayo
had
said
he
himself
was
the
second
it
seemed
ominous
but
it
would
never
do
to
manifest
curiosity
let
alone
apprehension
on
his
own
account
so
he
forebore
further
query
as
to
the
mystery
whatever
it
might
be
yet
he
thought
it
no
harm
to
say
and
what
was
this
white
man
silawayo
he
was
a
preacher
answered
the
other
chief
ngumúnye
the
king
loves
not
such
well
the
king
need
have
no
objections
to
himself
on
that
score
at
any
rate
thought
laurence
with
a
dash
of
grim
humour
but
he
only
said
the
king
tell
me
about
your
king
how
does
he
look
what
is
his
name
is
it
possible
o
stranger
that
you
have
never
heard
the
name
of
the
king
said
ngumúnye
turning
upon
laurence
a
blankly
astonished
face
did
not
silawayo
but
now
say
that
only
one
white
man
had
visited
your
country
and
even
he
had
not
returned
said
laurence
in
native
fashion
answering
one
query
with
another
ha
cried
both
chiefs
whom
an
idea
seemed
to
strike
then
ngumúnye
went
on
impressively
look
around
o
bearer
of
the
sign
of
the
spider
for
days
we
have
seen
no
man
the
remains
of
huts
have
we
seen
but
of
people
none
you
too
were
remarking
upon
it
but
yesterday
that
is
so
assented
laurence
the
remains
of
huts
but
of
people
none
repeated
the
induna
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
well
stranger
that
is
the
name
of
the
king
the
great
great
one
the
name
of
the
king
the
strong
wind
that
burns
from
the
north
repeated
laurence
translating
the
name
assented
the
chiefs
emphatically
now
say
hath
not
a
broad
belt
around
the
land
of
the
people
of
the
spider
been
burned
flat
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
which
took
in
the
desolated
region
they
had
gained
the
great
mountain
range
whose
snowy
summits
had
been
drawing
nearer
for
days
and
a
noble
range
indeed
it
was
apparently
moreover
of
immense
altitude
laurence
stanninghame
who
was
well
acquainted
with
the
alps
now
gazed
in
wonder
and
admiration
upon
these
titans
whose
white
heads
seemed
to
support
the
blue
vault
of
heaven
itself
to
such
dizzy
heights
did
they
soar
walls
of
black
cliff
overhung
with
cornices
even
as
with
gigantic
white
eyebrows
towered
up
from
dazzling
snow
slope
and
higher
still
riven
crags
split
into
all
fantastic
shapes
frowned
forth
as
though
to
menace
the
world
and
all
around
clinging
about
the
feet
of
these
stupendous
heights
soft
luxuriant
forests
tuneful
with
the
murmur
of
innumerable
glacier
streams
a
very
paradise
of
beauty
and
grandeur
side
by
side
thought
laurence
amid
which
the
shields
and
spears
the
marching
column
of
the
savage
host
seemed
strangely
out
of
keeping
how
are
they
called
those
mountains
silawayo
he
said
beyond
them
lies
the
land
of
the
people
of
the
spider
answered
the
induna
evasively
and
the
other
understood
that
he
must
not
look
for
exuberant
information
on
topographical
subjects
just
then
they
entered
the
mountains
by
a
deep
black
defile
which
pierced
the
range
for
a
day
and
night
they
wound
through
this
hardly
pausing
to
rest
for
it
had
become
piercingly
cold
moreover
as
silawayo
explained
even
when
the
weather
was
at
its
highest
stage
of
sultriness
elsewhere
in
the
mountains
the
changes
were
sudden
and
great
to
be
snowed
up
in
this
pass
was
too
serious
a
matter
to
risk
was
it
the
only
gate
by
which
the
country
of
the
was
entered
then
but
silawayo
did
not
seem
to
hear
this
question
he
descanted
learnedly
on
the
suddenness
of
the
mountain
storms
and
told
tales
of
more
than
one
which
had
set
forth
in
all
its
warlike
ardour
and
had
found
here
a
stiff
and
frozen
bed
whereon
its
people
might
rest
for
all
time
the
while
keenly
alert
to
take
in
all
the
features
of
the
route
laurence
affected
the
greatest
interest
in
the
conversation
of
those
around
him
but
there
was
that
about
the
dark
ruggedness
of
this
stupendous
pass
that
weighed
heavily
upon
his
mind
that
depressed
appalled
him
it
was
as
though
he
were
passing
through
some
black
and
gloomy
gate
which
should
shut
him
forever
from
the
outside
world
as
they
wound
their
way
now
where
the
cliffs
beetled
overhead
so
as
to
shut
out
the
heavens
now
along
some
dizzy
ledge
with
the
dull
roar
of
the
mountain
stream
wafted
up
on
icy
gusts
from
far
below
he
suffered
severely
from
the
cold
too
he
who
had
breathed
the
moist
torrid
heat
of
equatorial
forests
for
so
long
and
his
wound
became
congealed
and
stiff
yet
he
bore
himself
heroically
even
as
the
themselves
who
their
scanty
clothing
notwithstanding
seemed
to
feel
the
cold
not
one
whit
chatting
and
laughing
and
singing
while
they
marched
finally
the
ground
descended
once
more
and
at
length
while
he
was
nodding
in
slumber
at
the
dawn
of
day
during
one
of
their
brief
rests
ngumúnye
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
and
beckoned
that
he
should
accompany
him
laurence
complied
and
when
they
had
gained
the
brow
of
a
gently
rising
ridge
beyond
an
exclamation
of
wonder
and
admiration
burst
from
his
lips
lo
said
the
induna
pointing
down
with
his
lo
there
lies
the
land
of
the

rests

the

from
where
they
stood
the

fell
away
in
great
wooded
spurs
to
a
broad
level
valley
or
rather
plain
shut
in
on
the
farther
side
by
rolling
ranges
of
hills
the
valley
bottom
green
and
undulating
was
watered
by
numerous
streams
flashing
like
bands
of
silver
ribbon
in
the
golden
glow
of
the
newly
risen
sun
clustering
here
and
there
five
or
six
together
were
kraals
circular
and
symmetrical
built
on
the
zulu
plan
and
from
their
grass
huts
blue
lines
of
smoke
were
arising
upon
the
still
morning
air
already
dappling
the
sward
the
many
coloured
hides
of
innumerable
cattle
could
be
seen
moving
and
the
long
drawn
shout
and
whistle
of
these
who
tended
them
rose
in
faint
and
harmonious
echo
to
the
height
whence
they
looked
down
patches
of
broad
maize
too
stood
out
in
darker
squares
from
the
verdancy
of
the
grass
and
bird
voices
in
glad
note
made
merry
among
the
cool
leafy
forest
slopes
coming
in
contrast
to
the
steamy
heat
the
dank
and
gloomy
equatorial
vegetation
the
foul
and
noisome
surroundings
of
the
cannibal
villages
this
smiling
land
of
plenty
did
indeed
offer
to
him
who
now
first
beheld
it
a
fair
and
blithesome
sight
but
another
object
attracted
and
held
the
attention
of
the
spectator
even
more
than
all
this
was
an
immense
kraal
it
lay
on
the
slope
at
least
ten
miles
away
but
with
the
aid
of
his
glass
which
had
been
returned
to
him
from
among
the
slavers
loot
laurence
could
bring
it
very
near
indeed
the
huts
lay
six
or
seven
deep
between
their
dark
ringed
fences
the
great
circular
space
in
the
middle
the
or
inclosure
of
royal
dwellings
partitioned
off
at
the
upper
end
why
the
place
might
have
been

unexplored

interpreting
his

of
inquiry
come
let
us
go
down
as
the
great
which
up
till
now
had
been
marching
at
ease
emerged
upon
the
plain
once
more
the
warriors
formed
into
rank
and
advanced
in
serried
columns
singing
a
immediately
the
whole
land
was
as
a
disturbed
beehive
men
women
and
children
flocked
forth
to
welcome
them
the
latter
especially
pressing
forward
with
eager
curiosity
to
obtain
a
glimpse
of
the
white
man
the
first
of
the
species
they
had
ever
seen
and
the
air
rang
with
the
shrill
excited
cries
of
astonishment
wherewith
they
greeted
his
appearance
and
the
calm
unruffled
way
in
which
he
ignored
both
their
presence
and
amazement
much
singing
followed
the
answering
the
of
the
warriors
in
responsive
strophes
but
there
was
little
variety
in
these
which
consisted
largely
as
it
seemed
to
laurence
of
exuberant
references
to
the
spider
and
praise
of
the
king
as
they
drew
near
the
great
kraal
two
companies
of
girls
arrayed
in
beaded
dancing
dresses
advanced
waving
green
boughs
and
halting
in
front
of
the
returning
sang
a
song
of
welcome
their
voices
were
melodious
and
pleasing
to
the
last
degree
imparting
a
singular
charm
to
the
somewhat
monotonous
repetition
of
the
wild
chant
now
in
a
soft
musical
contralto
now
shrilling
aloft
in
a
note
of
pealing
gladness
laurence
who
was
beginning
to
feel
vividly
interested
in
this
strange
race
of
valiant
fighters
failed
not
to
note
that
many
of
these
girls
were
of
extraordinarily
prepossessing
appearance
with
their
tall
beautiful
figures
and
supple
limbs
their
clear
eyes
and
white
teeth
and
bright
pleasing
faces
then
suddenly
song
and
dance
alike
ceased
and
the
women
parting
into
two
companies
the
whole
moved
forward
again
marching
between
them
the
huge
kraal
was
very
near
now
the
palisade
lined
with
the
faces
of
eager
spectators
but
laurence
quick
to
take
in
impressions
noticed
that
here
there
were
no
severed
heads
stuck
about
in
ghastly
ornament
this
splendid
race
as
pitiless
and
unsparing
in
victory
as
it
was
intrepid
in
the
field
was
clearly
above
the
more
monstrous
and
revolting
forms
of
savage
barbarity
then
all
further
reflections
were
diverted
into
an
entirely
new
channel
for
the
whole
tossing
the
unarmed
right
hand
aloft
thundered
aloud
the
salute
royal
then
fell
prostrate
the
roar
sudden
and
as
one
man
of
that
multitude
of
voices
was
startling
terrifying
laurence
unprepared
for
any
such
move
found
himself
standing
there
he
alone
erect
while
around
him
as
so
much
mown
corn
lay
prostrate
on
their
faces
this
immense
company
of
armed
warriors
then
he
took
in
the
reason
just
in
front
of
where
the
had
halted
rose
a
small
cluster
of
trees
crowning
a
knoll
beneath
the
shade
thus
formed
was
a
group
of
men
in
a
attitude
all
save
one
yes
one
alone
was
standing
standing
a
little
in
advance
of
the
group
standing
tall
erect
majestic
in
a
splendid
attitude
of
ease
and
dignity
as
with
head
thrown
slightly
back
he
darted
his
clear
expressive
eyes
proudly
over
the
bending
host
a
man
in
the
prime
of
life
a
perfect
embodiment
of
symmetry
and
strength
he
wore
no
attempt
at
or
meretricious
adornment
his
shaven
head
was
crowned
with
the
usual
or
ring
whose
jetty
blackness
seemed
to
render
the
rich
copper
hue
of
the
smooth
skin
even
lighter
and
for
all
clothing
he
wore
a
of
and
leopards
tails
yet
laurence
stanninghame
gazing
upon
him
recognized
a
natural
dignity
nay
a
majesty
enthroning
this
nearly
naked
savage
such
as
he
had
never
seen
quite
equalled
in
the
aspect
or
deportment
of
any
other
living
man
clearly
this
was
the
king
tyisandhlu
the
strong
wind
that
burns
from
the
north
removing
his
hat
with
one
hand
he
raised
the
other
above
his
head
and
repeated
the
salute
royal
as
he
had
heard
it
from
the
warriors
the
king
acknowledged
his
greeting
by
a
brief
murmur
then
he
called
aloud
rise
up
my
children
as
one
man
that
huge
assembly
sprang
to
its
feet
and
the
quivering
rattle
of
was
as
a
winter
gale
rushing
through
a
leafless
wood
with
one
voice
it
began
to
thunder
forth
the
royal
titles
o
great
spider
terrible
spider
spider
whose
bite
is
death
o
serpent
o
elephant
thunderer
of
the
heavens
divider
of
the
sun
house
burner
o
destroyer
o
all
devouring
beast
these
were
some
of
the
titles
used
but
the
praisers
would
always
bring
back
the
to
some
attribute
of
the
spider
laurence
who
understood
the
system
noted
this
peculiarity
differing
as
it
did
from
the
zulu
practice
of
making
the
serpent
the
principal
term
of
praise
finally
as
by
signal
the
shouting
ceased
and
the
principal
leaders
of
the
disarming
crept
forward
two
by
two
to
the
king
feet
laurence
was
too
far
off
to
hear
what
was
said
for
the
tone
was
low
but
he
judged
and
rightly
that
the
chiefs
were
giving
an
account
of
the
expedition
at
length
the
king
dismissed
them
and
pointing
with
the
short
he
held
in
his
hand
ordered
that
he
himself
should
be
brought
forward
the
ranks
of
the
warriors
opened
to
let
him
through
and
as
having
been
careful
to
disarm
in
turn
he
advanced
laurence
could
not
repress
a
tightening
thrill
of
the
pulses
as
he
wondered
what
fate
it
was
as
regarded
himself
that
should
now
fall
from
the
lips
of
this
despot
whose
very
name
meant
a
terror
and
a
scourge
tyisandhlu
for
some
moments
uttered
no
word
but
stood
gazing
fixedly
upon
his
prisoner
in
contemplative
silence
laurence
for
his
part
was
studying
no
less
attentively
the
king
the
finely
shaped
head
and
lofty
brow
the
clear
eyes
and
oval
face
culminating
in
a
short
beard
whose
jetty
thickness
just
began
to
show
here
and
there
a
streak
of
gray
the
noble
stature
and
erect
carriage
impressed
him
even
more
thus
face
to
face
than
at
a
distance
they
say
thou
bearest
the
sign
of
this
nation
o
stranger
began
the
king
speaking
in
the
zulu
tongue
and
that
to
this
thou
owest
thy
life
that
is
true
great
great
one
answered
laurence
but
how
know
we
that
the
sign
is
genuine
continued
tyisandhlu
by
this
father
of
the
people
of
the
spider
not
once
has
it
stood
between
me
and
death
but
twice
and
that
at
the
hands
of
your
people
a
murmur
of
astonishment
escaped
his
hearers
but
the
king
said
when
was
this
other
time
for
such
would
in
truth
be
something
of
a
test
then
laurence
told
the
tale
of
his
conflict
with
the
warriors
beneath
the
by
the
lagoon
and
the
murmur
among
the
listeners
deepened
i
was
but
one
man
and
they
were
twelve
he
concluded
twelve
of
the
finest
warriors
in
the
world
even
the
warriors
of
the
people
of
the
spider
yet
they
could
not
harm
me
see
you
great
great
one
they
could
not
prevail
against
the
man
who
held
who
wore
the
sign
of
the
spider
now
an
emphatic
hum
arose
on
the
part
of
all
who
heard
and
indeed
there
had
been
a
silence
that
might
be
felt
while
he
had
been
narrating
his
tale
more
than
ever
was
laurence
convinced
that
in
deciding
to
tell
it
he
had
acted
with
sound
judgment
he
had
little
or
nothing
to
fear
from
the
vengeance
of
the
relatives
of
those
he
had
slain
for
he
had
seen
enough
of
these
people
to
guess
that
they
did
not
bear
a
grudge
over
the
fortunes
of
war
over
losses
sustained
in
fair
and
open
fight
and
on
the
other
hand
he
had
immensely
strengthened
his
own
case
yet
you
made
common
cause
with
these
foul
and
noisome
said
the
king
shifting
somewhat
his
ground
these
carrion
dogs
who
devour
one
another
even
their
own
flesh
and
blood
i
but
spared
one
of
their
villages
o
great
north
wind
for
the
rest
how
many
have
i
left
standing
that
is
so
said
tyisandhlu
still
gazing
fixedly
at
his
prisoner
then
he
signed
the
latter
to
retire
among
the
warriors
and
turning
gave
a
few
rapid
directions
in
a
low
voice
to
an
attendant
in
the
result
a
group
of
armed
warriors
was
seen
hurrying
forward
and
in
its
midst
a
man
unarmed
a
man
ragged
and
covered
with
dried
blood
and
with
his
arms
ignominiously
bound
behind
him
and
wild
amazement
was
in
store
for
laurence
he
had
reckoned
himself
the
sole
survivor
of
the
massacre
yet
now
in
this
helpless
and
prisoner
he
recognized
no
less
a
personage
than
lutali
his
body
and
limbs
slashed
with
many
his
clothing
cut
to
ribbons
his
and
filthy
aspect
as
he
was
hustled
forward
into
the
king
presence
the
arab
would
have
looked
a
pitiable
object
enough
but
for
one
thing
the
dignity
begotten
of
high
descent
and
indomitable
courage
never
left
him
not
for
one
moment
weak
as
he
was
with
loss
of
blood
and
the
pain
of
his
untended
and
mortifying
wounds
the
glance
of
his
eyes
no
less
than
the
set
of
his
keen
face
was
as
proud
as
fearless
as
that
of
the
king
himself
down
dog
growled
the
guards
flinging
him
forward
on
his
face
lick
the
earth
at
the
feet
of
the
great
north
wind
whose
blast
kills
but
immediately
lutali
staggered
to
his
feet
and
the
hell
blast
of
hate
and
fury
which
shone
from
his
eyes
was
perfectly
demoniacal
there
is
but
one
god
and
mohammed
is
the
prophet
of
god
he
roared
am
i
to
prostrate
myself
before
an
infidel
dog
the
chief
dog
of
a
pack
of
dogs
this
for
the
scum
and
he
spat
full
towards
tyisandhlu
an
indescribable
shiver
of
awe
ran
through
the
dense
and
serried
ranks
of
armed
warriors
followed
by
a
terrible
tumult
he
is
mad
cried
some
while
others
clamoured
give
him
to
us
great
great
one
we
will
put
him
to
the
fiery
death
but
the
king
returned
no
word
it
is
even
possible
that
his
own
intrepid
soul
was
moved
to
admiration
by
the
sublime
courage
of
this
man
his
prisoner
bound
helpless
weakened
standing
thus
before
him
before
him
at
whose
frown
men
trembled
face
to
face
and
thus
defying
him
one
other
who
beheld
it
the
sight
must
have
powerfully
moved
for
with
a
lull
in
the
tumult
a
voice
rose
clear
and
distinct
spare
him
o
great
great
one
for
he
is
a
brave
man
if
anyone
had
told
laurence
stanninghame
but
an
hour
earlier
that
he
was
about
to
commit
so
rash
and
suicidal
an
act
as
to
beg
the
life
of
another
at
the
hands
of
a
grossly
insulted
despot
and
in
the
face
of
an
enraged
nation
he
would
have
scouted
the
idea
as
too
weakly
idiotic
for
words
yet
in
fact
he
had
just
committed
that
very
act
deep
and
savage
were
the
resentful
growls
that
greeted
his
words
he
presumes
he
shares
in
the
insult
offered
to
the
majesty
of
the
king
were
some
of
the
ominous
mutterings
that
went
forth
the
king
merely
glanced
in
the
direction
of
the
speaker
and
said
nothing
but
lutali
becoming
aware
for
the
first
time
of
the
presence
of
his
former
confederate
turned
towards
the
latter
ask
not
my
life
at
the
hands
of
these
dogs
these
unclean
swine
afà
he
cried
lo
paradise
awaits
to
receive
the
believer
i
hasten
to
it
i
enter
it
and
he
threw
back
his
head
fearlessly
while
his
eyes
shone
with
a
fanatical
glare
spare
him
o
king
for
he
is
a
brave
man
urged
laurence
again
and
so
art
thou
i
think
replied
tyisandhlu
turning
a
somewhat
haughty
stare
upon
the
speaker
then
he
muttered
yet
not
this
one
an
interruption
occurred
gruesome
grotesque
a
number
of
figures
seeming
to
spring
from
no
one
knew
where
were
seen
gliding
forward
they
were
coal
black
from
head
to
foot
and
their
faces
were
more
like
masks
than
the
human
countenance
being
bedaubed
with
some
pigment
that
gave
each
of
them
the
aspect
of
possessing
two
huge
goggle
eyes
but
these
horrible
beings
seemed
at
first
sight
to
have
no
arms
and
no
legs
their
whole
anatomy
being
encased
in
a
sort
of
black
hairy
sacking
whence
tails
and
streamers
also
hairy
flapped
in
the
air
as
they
moved
hideous
indeed
they
looked
hideous
and
grotesque
half
reptile
half
devil
they
surrounded
lutali
all
in
dead
silence
the
guards
precipitately
falling
back
to
give
them
way
then
the
king
spoke
and
his
words
were
gentle
and
mocking
go
now
to
thy
paradise
o
believer
these
will
show
thee
the
way
he
waved
his
hand
and
in
obedience
to
the
signal
the
whole
group
of
black
horrors
fastened
upon
the
arab
and
dragged
him
away
and
from
all
who
beheld
there
went
up
a
deep
chest
note
of
exclamation
that
was
part
satisfaction
part
awe
the
king
having
received
further
reports
and
attended
to
other
business
connected
with
the
army
withdrew
laurence
watching
the
stately
personality
of
this
splendid
savage
retiring
amid
the
groups
of
indunas
towards
the
gate
of
the
great
kraal
felt
his
conjectures
as
to
his
own
fate
merge
in
a
vivid
sense
of
interest
but
tyisandhlu
seemed
to
have
forgotten
his
existence
for
he
bestowed
no
further
word
upon
him
however
he
was
taken
charge
of
by
ngumúnye
who
assigned
him
a
large
hut
within
the
royal
kraal

the
shadow
of
the
mystery
the
next
few
days
were
spent
by
the
in
dancing
and
ceremonial
and
by
laurence
stanninghame
in
trying
to
find
out
all
he
could
about
the
he
laid
himself
out
to
make
friends
with
them
and
this
was
easy
for
the
natural
suspiciousness
wherewith
the
savage
invariably
regards
a
new
acquaintance
once
fairly
laid
to
rest
the
proved
as
chatty
and
genial
a
race
of
people
as
those
of
the
original
zulu
stock
but
on
one
point
the
lips
of
old
and
young
alike
were
sealed
and
that
was
the
fate
of
lutali
no
word
would
they
ever
by
any
chance
let
fall
as
to
this
but
the
awed
silence
wherewith
they
would
treat
all
mention
of
it
and
their
hurried
efforts
to
change
the
subject
added
not
a
little
to
the
impression
the
last
glimpse
of
his
arab
confederate
had
made
upon
laurence
what
awesome
devilish
mystery
did
not
those
hideous
beings
represent
for
the
rest
he
learned
that
these
people
were
of
zulu
stock
and
having
opposed
the
accession
of
tshaka
when
that
potentate
usurped
the
royal
seat
of
dingiswayo
had
deemed
it
advisable
to
flee
they
had
migrated
northward
even
as
umzilikazi
and
his
followers
had
done
though
some
years
prior
to
the
flight
of
that
chieftain
but
they
were
nothing
if
not
conservative
and
so
intent
was
the
king
on
preserving
the
pure
zulu
blood
that
he
was
chary
of
allowing
any
slaves
among
them
as
it
was
the
issue
of
all
slaves
had
no
rights
and
could
under
no
circumstances
whatever
rise
above
the
condition
of
slavery
and
laurence
noting
the
grand
physique
and
even
the
handsome
appearance
of
the
sons
and
daughters
of
this
splendid
race
had
no
doubt
as
to
the
wisdom
of
such
a
restriction
now
as
the
days
went
by
there
began
to
grow
upon
laurence
a
sort
of
restfulness
the
terrible
conflict
and
merciless
massacre
of
his
friends
and
followers
had
impressed
him
but
momentarily
accustomed
as
he
was
to
scenes
of
horror
and
of
blood
and
indeed
in
direct
contrast
to
such
did
he
the
more
readily
welcome
the
peaceful
tranquillity
of
his
present
life
for
the
dreaded
at
home
were
a
quiet
and
pastoral
race
owning
extensive
herds
of
cattle
also
goats
and
a
strange
kind
of
sheep
though
true
to
their
origin
horned
cattle
formed
the
staple
of
their
possessions
and
the
land
around
the
king
great
palace
was
dappled
with
grazing
stock
and
the
air
was
musical
with
the
singing
of
women
hoeing
the
millet
and
maize
gardens
then
again
the
surrounding
country
swarmed
with
game
large
and
small
from
the
colossal
elephant
to
the
tiny
dinkerbuck
to
laurence
passionately
fond
of
sport
this
alone
was
sufficient
to
reconcile
him
to
his
strange
captivity
for
a
time
he
would
be
the
life
and
soul
of
the
hunting
parties
and
skill
and
success
together
with
his
untiring
energy
and
philosophical
acceptance
of
the
hardships
and
vicissitudes
of
the
chase
went
straight
to
the
hearts
of
these
fine
fearless
barbarians
he
became
quite
a
favourite
with
the
nation
the
female
side
of
the
latter
too
looked
upon
him
with
kindly
eyes
he
would
chaff
the
girls
when
he
came
upon
them
wandering
in
bevies
as
was
their
wont
and
tell
them
strange
stories
of
other
conditions
of
life
until
they
fairly
screamed
with
laughter
or
brought
their
hands
to
their
mouths
in
mute
wonder
nyonyoba
why
do
you
not
for
some
of
these
said
silawayo
one
day
coming
upon
him
thus
engaged
then
you
could
dwell
among
us
as
one
of
ourselves
one
might
do
worse
induna
of
the
king
he
returned
tranquilly
with
a
glance
at
the
group
of
merry
and
extremely
damsels
whom
he
had
been
convulsing
with
laughter
listen
to
our
father
they
cried
he
is
joking
indeed
farewell
nyonyoba
fare
thee
well
and
they
sped
away
still
screaming
with
laughter
the
old
induna
looked
quizzically
after
them
then
at
laurence
then
he
took
snuff
one
might
do
worse
silawayo
repeated
laurence
i
have
known
worse
times
than
those
i
have
already
undergone
here
but
all
i
possess
i
have
lost
my
slaves
your
people
have
killed
and
my
ivory
and
goods
the
king
has
taken
leaving
me
nothing
but
my
arms
and
ammunition
tell
me
then
do
the
give
their
daughters
for
nothing
or
how
shall
a
man
who
is
so
poor
think
to
set
up
a
kraal
of
his
own
the
induna
laughed
dryly
we
are
all
poor
that
way
for
all
we
own
belongs
to
the
king
yet
the
great
great
one
is
open
handed
he
might
return
some
of
your
goods
nyonyoba
this
by
the
way
was
laurence
sobriquet
among
these
people
bestowed
upon
him
by
reason
of
his
skill
and
craft
in
stalking
wild
game
it
was
even
as
he
had
said
this
raid
had
gone
far
towards
undoing
the
results
of
their
lawless
and
perilous
enterprise
a
portion
of
his
gains
were
safe
but
this
last
blow
was
of
crippling
force
and
only
a
day
or
so
prior
to
it
he
had
been
revelling
in
the
prospect
of
a
speedy
return
to
civilized
life
to
the
enjoyment
of
wealth
for
the
remainder
of
his
allotted
span
he
recalled
the
misgivings
uttered
by
holmes
that
wealth
thus
gained
would
bring
them
no
good
for
the
curse
of
blood
that
lay
upon
it
poor
holmes
the
prophecy
seemed
to
have
come
true
as
regarded
the
prophet
but
for
himself
well
the
loss
reconciled
him
still
more
to
his
life
among
the
of
tyisandhlu
he
had
seen
but
little
now
and
then
the
king
would
send
for
him
and
talk
for
a
time
upon
things
in
general
and
all
the
while
laurence
would
feel
that
the
shrewd
keen
eyes
of
this
barbarian
ruler
were
reading
him
like
a
book
tyisandhlu
moreover
had
expressed
a
wish
that
a
body
of
picked
men
should
be
armed
with
the
rifles
taken
from
the
slavers
and
instructed
in
their
use
and
to
this
laurence
had
readily
consented
yet
consider
ndabezita
he
had
said
is
it
well
to
teach
them
reliance
on
any
weapon
rather
than
the
broad
spear
for
had
your
army
possessed
never
would
it
have
eaten
up
our
camp
out
yonder
it
would
have
spent
all
its
time
and
energy
shooting
and
that
to
little
purpose
it
would
have
had
time
to
think
and
then
the
warriors
would
have
brought
but
half
a
heart
to
the
last
fierce
charge
there
is
much
in
what
you
say
nyonyoba
replied
the
king
yet
i
would
try
the
experiment
so
the
indunas
were
required
to
select
the
men
and
about
three
hundred
were
organized
and
laurence
having
spent
much
care
in
their
instruction
soon
turned
out
a
very
fair
corps
of
no
scruple
had
he
in
thus
increasing
the
fighting
strength
of
this
already
fierce
and
formidable
fighting
race
to
which
he
had
taken
a
great
liking
he
even
began
to
contemplate
the
contingency
of
ending
his
life
among
them
for
of
any
return
to
civilization
there
seemed
not
the
remotest
prospect
and
indeed
rather
than
return
without
the
wealth
for
which
he
had
risked
so
much
he
preferred
not
to
return
at
all
even
the
memory
of
lilith
brought
with
it
pain
rather
than
solace
after
all
this
time
years
indeed
now
would
not
his
memory
have
faded
the
life
he
had
led
tended
to
foster
such
memory
in
himself
but
with
her
it
was
otherwise
all
the
conditions
of
her
daily
life
tended
rather
to
dim
it
that
sweet
short
passionate
episode
had
been
all
entrancing
while
it
lasted
yet
was
it
not
counterpoised
by
the
certainty
that
with
women
of
her
temperament
such
episodes
are
but
episodes
all
the
bitter
side
of
his
philosophy
cried
aloud
in
the
affirmative
he
had
now
been
several
months
among
the
and
had
long
since
ceased
to
feel
any
misgiving
as
to
his
personal
safety
at
their
hands
but
his
sense
of
security
was
destined
to
receive
a
rude
shock
and
it
came
about
in
this
way
returning
one
day
from
a
hunt
at
some
distance
from
imvungayo
he
had
marched
on
ahead
of
his
companions
and
the
afternoon
being
hot
had
lain
down
in
the
shade
of
a
cluster
of
trees
for
a
brief
nap
from
this
the
buzz
of
muttering
voices
awakened
him
at
first
he
paid
no
attention
reckoning
that
the
remainder
of
the
party
had
come
up
but
soon
a
remark
which
was
let
fall
started
him
very
wide
awake
indeed
and
at
the
same
time
he
recognized
that
the
voices
were
not
those
of
his
present
companions
but
of
strangers
from
a
certain
quaver
or
hesitancy
in
the
tones
he
judged
them
to
be
the
voices
of
old
men
the
spider
must
be
growing
hungry
again
it
is
long
since
he
has
drunk
blood
not
since
the
son
of
tondusa
assumed
the
answered
the
other
and
now
a
greater
is
about
to
assume
the
went
on
the
first
speaker
even
ncute
the
son
of
nondwana
the
brother
of
the
great
great
one
the
same
asserted
the
first
speaker
in
that
hum
in
which
natives
when
among
themselves
will
carry
on
a
conversation
for
hours
now
the
listener
was
interested
indeed
on
the
mysterious
subject
of
the
spider
the
had
been
close
as
death
no
hint
or
indication
tending
to
throw
light
upon
it
would
they
let
fall
in
reply
to
any
question
direct
or
indirect
now
he
was
going
to
hear
something
these
men
unaware
of
his
presence
and
talking
freely
among
themselves
would
certainly
afford
more
than
a
clew
to
it
nondwana
the
brother
he
suspected
of
being
not
over
favourably
disposed
towards
himself
possibly
through
jealousy
that
will
be
when
the
second
moon
is
at
full
continued
one
of
the
talkers
it
will
ha
the
spider
will
receive
a
brave
offering
yet
how
shall
it
devour
one
who
bears
its
sign
it
may
not
rejoined
the
other
that
will
in
truth
be
a
test
if
the
sign
is
real
who
bears
its
sign
the
listener
felt
every
drop
of
blood
within
him
turn
cold
freeze
from
head
to
foot
what
sort
of
could
it
be
from
which
this
nation
derived
its
name
and
which
these
were
talking
about
as
one
that
devoured
men
that
bears
its
sign
the
words
could
apply
to
none
other
than
himself
he
had
deduced
that
although
the
held
cannibalism
in
abhorrence
yet
from
time
to
time
human
sacrifices
of
very
awesome
and
mysterious
nature
took
place
and
that
on
certain
momentous
occasions
the
accession
or
death
of
a
king
of
an
heir
to
any
branch
of
the
royal
house
or
such
a
one
as
this
now
under
discussion
the
admission
to
full
privileges
of
manhood
of
a
scion
of
the
same
and
the
sacrifice
on
this
occasion
was
to
consist
of
himself
to
this
end
he
had
been
spared
even
honoured
it
will
in
truth
be
a
test
for
some
doubt
that
the
sign
as
worn
by
this
stranger
hath
any
magic
at
all
continued
one
of
the
talkers
if
he
comes
out
unharmed
that
will
be
a
marvel
indeed
a
marvel
indeed
they
assented
then
they
fell
to
talking
of
other
things
and
soon
the
concealed
listener
heard
them
rise
up
and
depart
laurence
decided
to
wait
no
more
for
his
companions
he
wanted
to
be
alone
and
think
this
matter
out
so
when
the
voices
of
the
talkers
had
fairly
faded
beyond
earshot
he
left
the
cluster
of
trees
on
the
farther
side
and
took
his
way
down
the
mountain
slope
a
ghastly
fear
was
upon
him
the
horror
and
mystery
of
the
thing
got
upon
even
his
iron
nerves
the
suddenness
of
it
too
just
when
he
had
lulled
himself
into
a
complete
sense
of
security
had
he
learned
in
like
fashion
that
he
was
to
be
slain
in
an
ordinary
way
at
a
given
time
it
would
not
have
shaken
him
beyond
the
ordinary
but
this
thing
there
was
something
so
devilish
about
it
what
did
it
mean
was
it
some
grotesque
idol
worked
by
mechanism
even
as
in
the
old
pagan
temples
to
which
human
sacrifices
were
offered
or
for
he
could
not
candidly
discredit
all
the
weird
and
marvellous
tales
and
traditions
of
some
of
these
tribes
degraded
and
as
they
were
was
it
some
unknown
and
terrifying
monster
inhabiting
the
dens
and
caves
of
the
earth
whatever
it
was
he
knew
too
well
of
course
that
the
coincidence
which
had
so
miraculously
resulted
in
the
sparing
of
his
life
at
the
hands
of
the
victorious
reeking
with
slaughter
would
stand
him
in
nowhere
here
he
remembered
the
mystery
hanging
over
the
fate
of
lutali
and
those
horrible
beings
who
had
hauled
the
arab
to
his
doom
whatever
it
was
who
indeed
might
well
constitute
the
priesthood
of
the
unknown
surely
never
indeed
had
earth
presented
a
fairer
scene
than
this
upon
which
the
adventurer
eyes
rested
as
he
made
his
way
down
the
the
calm
peaceful
beauty
of
the
day
the
golden
sunlight
flooding
the
plain
beneath
the
great
circle
of
imvungayo
and
the
by
contrast
tiny
circles
of
lesser
kraals
scattered
about
the
valley
or
crowning
some
mountain
spur
and
mellow
upon
the
stillness
the
distant
low
of
cattle
the
singing
of
women
at
work
mingling
with
the
soft
voices
of
a
multitude
of
doves
in
cornlands
and
the
surrounding
yet
now
in
the
white
peaks
towering
to
the
cloudless
heavens
in
the
black
and
craggy
rifts
in
the
wide
rolling
plains
the
hunter
paradise
this
man
saw
only
a
gloomy
wizard
circle
inclosing
some
horrible
inferno
the
throne
of
the
frightful
of
this
extraordinary
race
then
it
occurred
to
laurence
that
he
had
better
not
let
this
thing
get
too
much
upon
his
nerves
it
was
the
result
of
inaction
he
told
himself
several
months
of
rest
and
tranquillity
had
begun
to
turn
him
soft
that
would
not
do
he
had
got
to
look
matters
in
the
face
fairly
and
squarely
the
ceremony
which
was
to
bring
him
to
what
would
almost
certainly
be
a
fearful
fate
was
set
for
the
fall
of
the
second
moon
the
talkers
had
said
but
of
this
he
had
been
already
aware
for
the
chief
nondwana
and
his
son
were
both
well
known
to
him
that
would
give
him
a
little
over
six
weeks
escape
nothing
short
of
a
miracle
could
effect
that
he
told
himself
remembering
the
immense
tract
of
desolate
country
surrounding
the
fastnesses
of
the
and
the
ferocious
cannibal
hordes
which
lay
beyond
these
and
who
indeed
would
wreak
a
vengeance
of
the
most
barbarous
kind
upon
their
old
enemy
and
scourge
the
did
they
find
him
alone
and
to
that
extent
no
longer
formidable
in
their
midst
the
friendship
of
the
king
no
that
was
based
on
superstition
even
as
the
friendship
of
the
entire
nation
even
it
was
assumed
for
an
end
again
should
he
boldly
challenge
the
pretensions
of
the
whatever
it
might
be
and
asserting
himself
to
be
the
real
one
offer
to
slay
the
horror
in
open
conflict
not
a
moment
reflection
was
needed
however
to
convince
him
of
the
utter
impracticability
of
this
scheme
the
cherished
superstition
of
a
great
nation
was
not
to
be
uprooted
in
any
such
fashion
the
only
way
of
escape
left
open
to
him
was
that
of
death
death
swift
and
sudden
the
death
of
the
suicide
to
escape
the
greater
horror
but
from
this
he
shrank
the
grim
hardness
of
his
recent
training
had
nerved
him
rather
to
face
peril
than
to
avoid
it
he
did
not
care
to
contemplate
such
a
way
out
of
the
dilemma
he
was
cornered
there
was
no
way
of
escape
and
then
as
he
walked
thus
thinking
and
thinking
hard
in
the
fierce
desperate
clearheadedness
of
a
strong
man
face
to
face
with
despair
a
voice
a
female
voice
lifted
in
song
sounded
across
his
path
nearer
and
nearer
and
now
a
wave
of
hope
of
relief
surged
through
laurence
stanninghame
heart
for
there
flooded
in
upon
him
as
with
an
inspiration
a
way
out
of
the
situation
for
he
knew
both
the
voice
and
the
singer
and
at
that
moment
a
turn
in
the
bushes
brought
the
latter
and
himself
face
to
face

young

and
pleasing
expression
common
among
the
of

maidens
enhanced
by
large
lustrous

parted
in

wore

and
a
soft

splendid
outlines
of

there
was
an
aspect
of

in

of

which
the
grecian
effect
of
the

into
which

went
far
to
enhance

began
in
a
sweet
and
musical
voice
i
was
startled
for
a
moment
here
where
i
expected
to
find
none
to
thee
greeting
daughter
of
the
great
returned
laurence
for
this
girl
was
a
princess
of
the
highest
rank
in
the
nation
being
in
fact
a
daughter
of
nondwana
the
king
brother
that
same
chief
whose
accession
to
manhood
was
to
be
the
occasion
of
his
own
departure
to
another
sphere
nor
was
it
indeed
the
first
time
these
two
had
talked
together
and
why
are
you
sad
and
heavy
of
countenance
nyonyoba
was
the
hunt
bad
the
game
scarce
she
went
on
with
a
quick
searching
glance
into
his
eyes
not
so
he
answered
those
who
are
with
me
bring
on
much
ivory
for
the
king
treasury
for
yourself
lindela
i
found
a
and
rare
bird
which
i
will
stuff
and
set
up
for
you
the
girl
uttered
a
cry
of
delight
and
her
face
brightened
it
so
happened
that
laurence
was
something
of
a
taxidermist
and
had
already
stuffed
a
few
birds
and
small
animals
for
the
chief
daughter
who
was
as
delighted
with
her
increasing
museum
as
any
child
could
have
been
now
in
her
unfeigned
glee
over
the
prospect
of
a
new
specimen
lindela
looked
extremely
attractive
and
noting
it
an
unconscious
softness
had
crept
into
the
man
tone
even
the
girls
behind
noticed
it
and
whispered
to
each
other
sniggering
isityeli
quite
a
wooer
nyonyoba
is
hoeing
up

land
withdraw
a
little
from
these
lindela
he
said
in
a
lowered
tone
i
would
talk
the
chief
daughter
made
a
barely
perceptible
sign
but
her
attendants
understood
it
and
remained
where
they
stood
the
success
or
failure
of
a
hunt
is
a
small
thing
such
does
not
render
a
man
heavy
of
countenance
he
went
on
when
they
were
beyond
earshot
what
does
then
said
the
girl
raising
her
large
eyes
swiftly
to
his
sorrow
parting
such
are
the
things
which
make
life
dark
i
have
dwelt
long
among
your
people
and
at
the
prospect
of
leaving
them
my
heart
is
sore
as
the
last
words
left
his
lips
laurence
learned
in
just
one
brief
flash
of
a
second
exactly
what
he
wanted
to
know
but
the
look
of
startled
pain
in
lindela
face
gave
way
to
one
of
surprise
of
leaving
them
she
echoed
has
the
great
great
one
then
ordered
you
to
begone
nyonyoba
not
yet
but
it
will
be
so
listen
at
the
full
of
the
second
moon
a
cry
escaped
her
she
understood
for
a
moment
the
of
her
savage
ancestors
entirely
forsook
her
she
became
the
child
of
nature
all
human
it
shall
not
be
it
shall
not
be
the
passion
the
abandonment
in
the
soft
liquid
zulu
tone
in
the
large
eyes
transforming
the
whole
attractive
face
touched
even
him
penetrated
even
the
scaly
armour
which
encased
his
hardened
heart
considerations
of
expediency
no
longer
reigned
there
alone
as
he
stood
face
to
face
with
the
chief
daughter
she
was
a
magnificent
specimen
of
womanhood
he
decided
gazing
with
unfeigned
admiration
upon
her
splendid
frame
upon
the
unconscious
grace
of
her
every
movement
if
i
go
i
return
not
ever
he
went
on
resolved
to
strike
while
the
iron
was
hot
to
strike
as
hard
as
he
knew
how
yet
how
to
remain
for
the
brother
of
the
king
is
so
great
a
chief
that
he
who
would
approach
him
with
would
need
to
own
half
the
wealth
of
the
people
now
i
who
owned
much
wealth
am
yet
poor
for
the
have
killed
all
my
slaves
and
the
king
has
taken
my
ivory
and
goods
the
girl
eyes
sparkled
perhaps
she
too
had
learned
something
she
wanted
to
know
indeed
it
must
have
been
so
for
her
whole
face
was
lit
up
with
a
gladsome
light
a
wonderfully
attractive
light
perchance
the
king
will
return
some
of
it
she
said
yet
you
are
a
white
man
and
strong
nyonyoba
are
all
white
men
like
you
i
wonder
and
can
overcome
all
difficulties
listen
you
shall
not
leave
us
at
the
full
of
the
second
moon
now
farewell
and
forget
not
my
name
there
was
a
grandeur
of
resolution
in
her
tone
in
her
glance
as
she
uttered
these
last
words
her
lustrous
eyes
wide
and
clear
meeting
his
full
laurence
standing
there
gazing
after
the
tall
retreating
form
of
the
chief
daughter
felt
something
like
a
sense
of
exultation
stealing
over
him
his
scheme
seemed
already
to
glow
with
success
he
had
suspected
for
some
time
that
lindela
regarded
him
with
more
than
favour
and
indeed
while
weighing
the
prospect
of
casting
in
his
lot
with
the
he
had
already
in
his
own
mind
marked
her
out
to
share
it
now
however
the
thing
had
become
imperative
in
order
to
save
not
merely
his
life
but
to
escape
a
fate
which
brooded
over
him
with
a
peculiarly
haunting
horror
he
had
got
to
do
this
thing
to
take
to
wife
according
to
the
customs
of
the
the
daughter
of
nondwana
the
niece
of
the
king
then
not
a
man
in
the
nation
dare
raise
a
hand
against
him
and
the
dour
priesthood
of
the
spider
might
look
further
for
their
victim
and
might
find
in
their
selection
one
much
more
remote
from
the
throne
and
now
that
he
was
face
to
face
with
the
prospect
it
struck
him
as
anything
but
an
unpleasing
one
such
an
alliance
would
place
him
among
the
most
powerful
chiefs
in
the
land
all
the
ambition
in
the
adventurer
soul
warmed
to
the
prospect
to
be
high
in
authority
among
this
fine
race
over
this
splendid
country
sport
in
abundance
and
that
of
the
most
enthralling
kind
war
occasionally
to
dwell
too
in
the
strong
revivifying
air
of
these
grand
uplands
why
a
man
might
live
forever
under
such
conditions
and
the
other
side
of
the
picture
what
was
it
even
if
he
returned
to
civilization
even
if
it
were
possible
he
would
now
return
almost
as
poor
as
he
had
quitted
it
to
the
old
squalid
life
with
its
shifts
and
straits
his
whole
soul
sickened
over
the
recollection
nothing
could
compensate
for
such
nothing
besides
put
nakedly
it
amounted
to
this
his
experiences
of
respectability
had
been
disastrous
they
had
been
such
as
to
draw
out
all
that
was
latently
evil
in
his
nature
and
indeed
to
implant
within
him
traits
which
at
one
time
he
could
never
have
suspected
himself
capable
of
harbouring
physically
it
had
reduced
his
system
to
the
lowest
all
things
considered
he
could
not
think
that
the
adventurous
life
hard
unscrupulous
lawless
as
it
was
had
changed
him
for
the
worse
it
had
developed
many
good
traits
and
had
enabled
him
to
forget
many
evil
ones
i
would
have
speech
with
the
king
those
who
sentinelled
the
gate
of
the
great
kraal
imvungayo
conferred
a
moment
among
themselves
and
immediately
two
men
were
sent
to
learn
the
royal
pleasure
as
to
the
request
laurence
stanninghame
awaiting
their
return
was
taciturn
and
moody
and
as
he
gazed
around
his
one
thought
was
lest
his
scheme
should
miscarry
the
sun
had
just
gone
below
the
western
peaks
and
a
radiant
afterglow
lingered
upon
the
dazzling
snow
ridges
flooding
some
with
a
roseate
hue
while
others
seemed
dyed
long
files
of
women
calabash
on
head
were
wending
up
from
the
stream
singing
as
they
walked
or
exchanging
jests
and
laughter
their
soft
rich
voices
echoing
melodiously
upon
the
evening
stillness
even
the
shrill
moo
of
cattle
and
the
voices
of
men
mellowed
by
distance
came
not
inharmoniously
from
the
smaller
kraals
which
lay
scattered
along
the
hillside
and
but
for
the
shining
spearheads
and
tufted
shields
of
the
armed
guard
in
the
great
circle
of
imvungayo
the
scene
was
a
most
perfect
one
of
pastoral
simplicity
and
peace
and
then
as
the
gray
pearly
lights
of
evening
merging
into
the
sombre
shades
of
twilight
drew
a
deepening
veil
over
this
scene
of
fair
and
wondrous
beauty
once
more
the
words
of
lindela
in
all
their
unhesitating
reassurance
seemed
to
sound
in
this
man
ears
rekindling
the
fire
of
hope
within
his
soul
perchance
rekindling
fire
of
a
different
nature
the
great
great
one
awaits
you
nyonyoba
laurence
started
from
his
reverie
and
accompanied
by
two
of
the
guards
proceeded
across
the
great
open
space
in
silence
at
the
gate
of
the
an
inclosure
made
of
the
finest
woven
grass
and
containing
the
royal
dwellings
he
deposited
his
rifle
on
the
ground
and
deliberately
unbuckling
the
strap
of
his
revolver
holster
placed
that
weapon
behind
the
other
and
thus
unarmed
according
to
strict
zulu
etiquette
he
prepared
to
enter
an
or
royal
household
servant
received
him
at
the
gate
and
the
guards
having
saluted
and
withdrawn
he
was
ushered
by
the
attendant
into
the
king
presence
the
royal
house
a
large
circular
hut
differed
in
no
respect
from
the
others
save
that
it
was
of
somewhat
greater
size
laurence
standing
upright
within
it
could
make
out
three
seated
figures
the
shimmer
of
their
and
the
occasional
shine
of
eyeballs
being
the
only
distinct
feature
about
them
then
somebody
threw
an
armful
of
dry
twigs
upon
the
fire
which
burned
in
the
centre
and
as
the
light
crackled
up
he
saw
before
him
the
king
and
the
two
fighting
indunas
ngumúnye
and
silawayo
he
exclaimed
lifting
his
hat
courteously
i
behold
you
nyonyoba
replied
the
king
welcome
be
seated
with
a
murmur
of
acknowledgment
laurence
subsided
upon
the
grass
mat
which
had
been
placed
for
him
by
the
who
had
followed
him
in
then
there
was
silence
for
a
few
moments
while
a
couple
of
women
entered
bearing
large
clay
bowls
of
or
native
beer
and
the
liquor
having
been
apportioned
out
according
to
etiquette
the
attendants
withdrew
leaving
laurence
alone
with
the
king
and
the
two
indunas
and
the
hunt
has
it
been
propitious
began
tyisandhlu
presently
it
has
ten
tusks
of
ivory
are
even
now
being
brought
in
replied
laurence
also
an
unusually
fine
leopard
skin
which
fell
to
my
bullet
and
which
i
would
beg
the
king
to
accept
you
are
a
great
hunter
nyonyoba
a
very
great
one
the
will
become
too
rich
if
you
tarry
long
among
us
said
tyisandhlu
quizzically
but
evidently
pleased
at
the
news
we
shall
soon
be
able
to
arm
the
whole
nation
with
the
now
that
we
have
so
much
ivory
to
trade
with
the
northern
peoples
something
in
the
words
struck
laurence
if
you
tarry
long
among
us
the
king
had
said
even
these
were
ominous
and
made
in
favour
of
the
sinister
design
he
had
so
accidentally
discovered
yet
could
this
courtly
hospitality
of
which
he
was
the
object
indeed
cover
such
a
horrible
purpose
well
he
dare
not
bolster
himself
up
with
any
hope
to
the
contrary
for
now
many
and
many
an
incident
returned
to
his
mind
little
understood
at
the
time
but
in
the
light
of
the
conversation
he
had
overheard
as
clear
as
noonday
the
fear
the
anxiety
too
which
had
flashed
over
the
face
of
lindela
at
his
significant
words
proved
that
the
ordeal
through
which
it
was
designed
to
pass
him
was
a
real
and
a
terrible
one
through
her
and
her
only
lay
his
chance
of
escaping
it
i
am
glad
the
king
is
pleased
he
went
on
for
i
would
fain
tarry
among
the
forever
and
becoming
one
of
that
people
shall
not
all
my
efforts
turn
towards
rendering
it
a
great
people
a
hum
of
astonishment
escaped
the
two
indunas
and
laurence
thought
to
detect
the
same
significant
look
on
both
their
faces
then
he
added
and
those
whom
i
have
already
taught
in
the
use
of
the
they
are
strong
in
it
and
reliable
that
is
so
assented
tyisandhlu
and
i
have
taught
many
the
ways
of
the
chase
no
less
than
the
more
skilled
ways
of
war
that
too
is
true
o
burning
wind
that
too
is
true
repeated
the
king
good
and
now
i
would
crave
a
boon
while
the
people
of
the
spider
have
become
more
formidable
in
war
while
the
ivory
comes
pouring
into
the
king
treasury
faster
than
ever
it
did
before
so
that
soon
there
will
be
enough
to
buy
for
the
whole
nation
i
who
brought
all
this
to
pass
remain
poor
am
the
poorest
in
the
nation
and
the
daughters
of
the
are
fair
exceeding
fair
exclaimed
the
two
indunas
simultaneously
with
their
hands
to
their
mouths
but
tyisandhlu
said
nothing
though
a
very
humorous
gleam
seemed
to
steal
over
his
fine
features
in
the
firelight
the
daughters
of
the
are
exceeding
fair
repeated
laurence
but
i
the
poorest
man
in
the
nation
can
not
take
wives
for
how
shall
i
go
to
the
father
of
a
girl
and
say
i
desire
thy
daughter
to
wife
but
my
slaves
have
been
killed
and
my
other
possessions
are
now
the
property
of
the
king
yet
inasmuch
as
i
can
not
offer
having
nothing
give
her
to
me
on
the
same
terms
my
house
will
not
grow
great
in
that
way
say
now
ndabezita
will
it
i
think
not
nyonyoba
answered
the
king
struggling
to
repress
a
laugh
yet
perhaps
a
way
may
be
found
out
of
that
difficulty
for
in
truth
thou
hast
done
us
good
service
already
but
we
will
talk
further
as
to
this
matter
in
the
future
for
the
present
here
waits
outside
one
who
will
show
thee
what
thou
wilt
be
glad
to
see
quick
to
take
this
hint
of
dismissal
laurence
now
arose
saluted
the
king
and
retired
not
so
far
with
the
results
of
his
interview
for
in
the
circumlocutory
native
way
of
dealing
with
matters
of
importance
tyisandhlu
had
received
with
favour
his
request
preferred
after
the
same
method
that
some
of
his
possessions
should
be
restored
to
him
then
he
would
offer
for
lindela
and
i
accompany
you
farther
nyonyoba
at
the
word
of
the
great
great
one
by
whose
light
we
live
the
voice
of
the
who
had
ushered
him
forth
broke
in
upon
his
meditations
this
man
instead
of
leaving
him
at
the
gate
of
the
still
kept
at
his
side
and
laurence
manifesting
no
curiosity
having
picked
up
his
weapons
where
he
had
left
them
accompanied
his
guide
in
silence
they
passed
out
of
imvungayo
and
after
walking
nearly
a
mile
came
to
a
large
kraal
which
laurence
recognized
as
that
of
nondwana
the
brother
and
now
for
the
first
time
he
felt
a
thrill
of
interest
surge
through
him
nondwana
kraal
had
tyisandhlu
divining
his
wishes
indeed
forestalled
them
but
this
idea
was
as
quickly
dismissed
as
formulated
the
king
had
probably
ordered
that
one
or
two
of
the
girls
should
be
allotted
to
him
possibly
chosen
from
those
in
attendance
upon
the
royal
wives
his
parting
remark
seemed
to
point
that
way
enter
said
the
halting
before
one
of
the
huts
enter
and
good
go
with
thee
i
return
to
the
king
fare
thee
well
laurence
bent
down
and
pushed
back
the
wicker
slab
that
formed
the
door
of
the
hut
and
having
crawled
through
the
low
entrance
stood
upright
within
and
instinctively
kicked
the
fire
into
a
blaze
and
then
indeed
was
amazement
wild
incredulous
bewildering
amazement
his
dominant
feeling
for
by
the
light
thus
obtained
he
saw
that
the
hut
was
tenanted
by
two
persons
no
feminine
voice
however
was
raised
to
bid
him
welcome
in
the
soft
tongue
of
the
but
a
loud
masculine
english
one

by
the
great
lord

kind

lindela

to
wait
for
in
the
sense
of
to

for
hence
the
full
significance
of
the
parting
remark
chapter
xxiv
as
from
the
dead
there
there
holmes
do
you
quite
intend
to
maim
a
chap
for
life
or
what
exclaimed
laurence
liberating
with
an
effort
his
hand
from
the
other
wringing
grasp
and
hazon
too
in
truth
life
is
full
of
surprises
how
are
you
hazon
so
so
was
the
reply
as
hazon
who
had
been
biding
the
evaporation
of
his
younger
friend
effusiveness
now
came
forward
but
his
handshake
was
characteristic
of
the
man
for
it
was
as
though
they
had
parted
only
last
week
and
that
but
temporarily
and
is
it
really
you
yourself
old
chap
rattled
on
holmes
it
for
all
the
world
as
if
you
had
risen
from
the
dead
why
we
never
expected
to
set
eyes
on
you
again
in
life
did
we
hazon
not
much
assented
that
worthy
laconically
well
i
can
say
the
same
as
regards
yourselves
rejoined
laurence
what
in
the
world
made
them
give
you
quarter
do
know
answered
hazon
we
managed
to
get
together
back
to
back
we
two
and
were
fighting
like
cats
holmes
got
a
shot
on
the
head
with
a
club
that
sent
him
down
and
i
got
stuck
full
of
assegais
till
i
could
see
the
next
thing
i
knew
was
that
we
were
being
carted
along
in
the
middle
of
a
big
heaven
knew
where
one
thing
we
were
both
alive
alive
and
kicking
too
as
soon
as
we
were
able
to
walk
they
assegaied
our
bearers
and
made
us
walk
do
you
swallow
all
that
stanninghame
cut
in
holmes
he
fought
standing
over
me
fought
like
any
devil
the
say
although
he
makes
out
now
it
was
all
playful
fun
well
for
the
matter
of
that
we
had
to
fight
rejoined
hazon
tranquilly
where
have
you
been
all
this
time
stanninghame
here
at
imvungayo
and
you
two
shot
if
i
know
they
kept
us
at
some
place
away
in
the
mountains
only
brought
us
here
a
few
days
back
they
wo
let
us
out
in
the
daytime
chimed
in
holmes
and
getting
deadly
monotonous
but
tell
us
old
chap
how
it
is
they
stick
you
this
however
laurence
following
out
a
vein
of
vague
instinct
had
decided
not
to
do
wherefore
he
invented
some
commonplace
solution
and
it
was
with
strange
and
mingled
feelings
he
sat
there
listening
to
his
old
confederates
for
months
he
had
not
heard
one
word
of
the
english
tongue
and
now
these
two
risen
as
it
were
from
the
very
grave
seemed
to
bring
back
all
the
past
which
under
novel
and
strange
conditions
had
more
and
more
been
fading
into
the
background
he
was
even
constrained
to
admit
to
himself
that
such
feelings
were
not
those
of
unmingled
joy
he
had
almost
lost
all
inclination
to
escape
from
among
this
people
and
now
these
two
by
the
very
associations
which
their
presence
recalled
were
likely
to
unsettle
him
again
possibly
to
his
own
peril
and
undoing
anyway
he
resolved
to
say
nothing
as
to
the
incident
of
the
sign
of
the
spider
well
you
seem
to
have
got
round
them
better
than
we
did
stanninghame
said
hazon
with
a
glance
at
the
express
rifle
and
revolver
wherewith
the
other
was
armed
we
have
hardly
been
allowed
so
much
as
a
stick
so
well
i
been
teaching
some
of
them
to
shoot
that
may
have
had
a
little
to
do
with
it
in
fact
i
been
laying
myself
out
to
make
thoroughly
the
best
of
the
situation
that
sound
sense
everywhere
rejoined
hazon
you
ca
get
holmes
here
to
see
it
though
he
wearing
out
his
wanting
to
break
away
this
was
no
more
than
the
truth
laurence
seated
there
narrowly
watching
his
old
comrades
was
swift
to
notice
that
whereas
these
months
of
captivity
and
suspense
had
left
hazon
the
same
cool
saturnine
philosophical
being
he
had
first
known
him
upon
holmes
they
had
had
quite
a
different
effect
there
was
a
restless
eager
nervousness
about
the
younger
man
a
sort
of
straining
to
break
away
even
as
the
more
seasoned
adventurer
had
described
it
the
fact
was
he
was
getting
desperately
i
wish
i
had
never
had
anything
to
do
with
this
infernal
business
he
now
bursts
forth
petulantly
i
swear
i
give
all
we
have
made
to
be
back
safe
and
snug
in
johannesburg
with
white
faces
around
us
even
though
i
were
stony
broke
especially
one
face
bantered
laurence
well
keep
up
your
form
holmes
you
may
be
back
there
yet
safe
and
sound
and
not
stony
broke
either
no
no
there
is
a
curse
upon
us
as
i
said
all
along
no
good
will
come
to
us
through
such
gains
we
shall
never
return
never
and
then
laurence
looked
across
at
hazon
and
the
glance
done
into
words
read
what
the
mischief
to
be
made
of
such
a
prize
fool
as
this
the
night
was
spent
in
talking
over
past
experiences
and
making
plans
for
the
future
as
to
which
latter
hazon
failed
not
to
note
with
faint
amusement
blended
with
complacency
that
the
disciple
had
if
anything
surpassed
his
teacher
in
other
words
laurence
entered
into
such
plans
with
a
which
would
have
been
astonishing
to
the
superficial
judgment
but
was
not
so
to
that
of
his
listener
nondwana
the
brother
of
the
king
was
seated
among
a
group
of
his
followers
in
the
gate
as
laurence
went
forth
the
next
morning
to
return
to
his
own
quarters
this
chief
though
older
than
tyisandhlu
in
years
was
not
the
son
of
the
principal
wife
of
their
common
father
wherefore
tyisandhlu
who
was
had
in
accordance
with
native
custom
succeeded
there
had
been
whisperings
that
nondwana
had
attempted
to
oppose
the
accession
and
very
nearly
with
success
but
whether
from
motives
of
policy
or
generosity
tyisandhlu
had
foreborne
to
take
his
life
the
former
motive
may
have
counted
for
nondwana
exercised
a
powerful
influence
in
the
nation
in
aspect
he
was
a
tall
fine
handsome
man
with
all
the
dignity
of
manner
which
characterized
his
royal
brother
yet
there
was
a
sinister
expression
ever
lurking
in
his
face
a
cruel
droop
in
the
corner
of
the
mouth
greeting
nyonyoba
and
is
it
good
once
more
to
behold
a
white
face
said
the
chief
a
veiled
irony
lurking
beneath
the
outward
geniality
of
his
tone
to
behold
the
face
of
a
friend
once
more
is
always
good
branch
of
a
royal
tree
returned
laurence
sitting
down
among
the
group
to
take
snuff
even
when
it
is
that
of
one
risen
from
the
dead
but
here
it
was
not
so
ndabezita
my
told
me
that
these
were
all
the
time
alive
rejoined
laurence
with
mendacity
on
a
truly
generous
scale
ha
thy
spider
yet
thou
art
not
of
the
people
of
the
spider
but
i
bear
the
sign
touching
his
breast
there
are
many
things
made
clear
to
me
which
may
or
may
not
be
set
forward
in
the
light
of
all
at
the
fall
of
the
second
moon
farewell
now
son
of
the
great
the
start
of
astonishment
the
murmur
which
ran
round
the
group
was
not
lost
upon
him
it
was
all
confirmatory
of
what
he
had
heard
and
then
as
he
walked
back
to
his
tent
in
silawayo
kraal
it
occurred
to
laurence
that
he
had
probably
made
a
false
move
nondwana
who
of
course
was
not
ignorant
of
his
daughter
partiality
would
almost
certainly
decide
that
lindela
had
betrayed
the
secret
and
sinister
intent
to
its
unconscious
object
and
in
that
event
how
would
it
fare
with
her
he
felt
more
than
anxious
the
king
might
take
long
in
deciding
whether
to
restore
his
property
or
not
and
etiquette
forbade
him
to
refer
to
the
matter
again
at
any
rate
for
some
time
to
come
that
nondwana
might
demand
too
much
or
possibly
refuse
it
altogether
as
coming
from
him
was
a
contingency
which
strange
to
say
completely
escaped
laurence
scheming
mind
greeting
nyonyoba
thy
thoughts
are
deep
ever
deep
the
voice
soft
rich
bantering
almost
made
him
start
as
he
raised
his
eyes
to
meet
the
glad
laughing
ones
of
the
object
of
his
thoughts
at
that
moment
the
chief
daughter
what
do
you
here
wandering
alone
lindela
he
said
ha
ha
now
you
did
well
to
say
my
name
like
that
for
does
it
not
answer
your
question
wait
to
watch
for
and
what
is
meant
for
two
ears
is
not
meant
for
four
or
six
i
have
news
but
it
is
not
good
they
were
standing
in
the
dip
of
the
path
where
a
little
runlet
coursed
along
between
high
banks
and
the
tall
graceful
form
of
the
girl
stood
out
in
splendid
relief
from
its
background
of
foliage
not
only
for
love
had
she
awaited
him
here
for
her
eyes
were
sad
and
troubled
as
she
narrated
her
discoveries
which
amounted
to
this
it
was
next
to
impossible
for
laurence
to
escape
the
ordeal
whatever
it
might
be
all
of
weight
and
position
in
the
nation
were
resolved
upon
it
and
none
more
thoroughly
so
than
nondwana
the
king
himself
would
be
powerless
to
save
him
even
if
he
wished
and
indeed
why
should
he
run
counter
to
the
desire
of
a
whole
nation
and
that
on
behalf
of
a
stranger
some
time
an
enemy
laurence
listening
felt
his
anxiety
deepen
the
net
was
closing
in
around
him
had
indeed
already
closed
and
from
it
there
was
no
outlet
see
now
lindela
he
said
gravely
his
eyes
full
upon
the
troubled
face
of
the
girl
if
this
thing
has
got
to
be
there
is
no
help
for
it
and
however
it
turns
out
the
world
will
go
on
just
the
same
and
the
sun
rise
and
set
as
before
why
grieve
about
it
because
i
love
you
love
you
do
you
hear
i
know
not
how
it
is
we
girls
of
the
do
not
love
not
like
this
we
like
to
be
married
to
men
who
are
great
in
the
nation
powerful
indunas
if
not
too
old
or
those
who
have
much
cattle
or
who
will
name
us
for
their
principal
wife
but
we
know
not
how
to
love
yet
you
have
taught
me
nyonyoba
say
now
is
it
through
the
magic
of
the
white
people
you
have
done
it
it
may
be
so
replied
laurence
smiling
queerly
to
himself
as
he
thought
how
exactly
if
unconsciously
this
alluring
child
of
nature
had
described
her
civilized
sisters
then
his
face
became
alert
and
watchful
he
was
listening
intently
i
too
heard
something
murmured
lindela
scarcely
moving
her
lips
i
fear
lest
we
have
been
overlooked
now
fare
thee
well
for
i
must
return
but
my
ears
are
ever
open
to
what
men
say
and
my
father
talks
much
and
talks
loud
it
may
be
that
i
may
learn
yet
more
but
nyonyoba
delay
not
in
thy
first
purpose
lest
it
be
too
late
and
remember
nondwana
has
a
covetous
hand
fare
thee
well
left
alone
laurence
thought
he
might
just
as
well
make
sure
that
no
spy
had
been
watching
them
yet
though
he
examined
the
banks
of
the
stream
for
some
little
distance
around
he
could
find
no
trace
of
any
human
presence
no
mark
even
however
faint
of
human
foot
still
as
he
gained
his
own
quarters
in
silawayo
kraal
a
presentiment
lay
heavy
upon
him
a
weird
boding
presentiment
of
evil
to
come
of
evil
far
nearer
at
hand
than
he
had
hitherto
deemed
long
and
hard
he
slept
for
he
was
weary
with
wakefulness
and
anxiety
and
when
he
awoke
at
dusk
intending
to
seek
an
interview
with
the
king
he
beheld
that
which
in
no
wise
tended
to
allay
his
fears
for
as
he
drew
nearer
to
imvungayo
there
issued
from
its
gate
a
crowd
of
figures
of
black
grotesque
horrible
figures
and
in
the
midst
a
man
whom
they
were
dragging
along
in
grim
silence
even
as
they
had
hauled
lutali
to
his
unknown
doom
and
as
they
disappeared
into
the
gathering
darkness
laurence
knew
only
too
well
that
here
was
another
victim
another
hideous
sacrifice
to
the
grisly
and
mysterious
no
wonder
his
blood
grew
chill
within
him
would
he
be
the
next
and
you
would
still
become
one
of
us
nyonyoba
i
would
great
great
one
and
to
this
end
have
i
sent
much
ivory
and
many
things
the
white
people
prize
including
three
new
guns
and
much
ammunition
to
nondwana
ha
nondwana
hand
is
large
and
opens
wide
said
the
king
with
a
hearty
chuckle
yet
lindela
is
a
sprig
of
a
mighty
tree
and
i
think
nyonyoba
you
yourself
are
sprung
from
such
a
root
that
is
no
lie
ruler
of
the
wise
as
a
man
whole
height
is
to
the
length
of
half
his
leg
so
is
the
length
of
my
house
to
that
of
the
kings
of
the
or
even
to
that
of
senzangakona
himself
ha
that
may
well
be
thou
hast
a
look
that
way
this
conversation
befell
two
days
after
the
events
just
described
the
king
had
refused
him
an
audience
on
that
evening
and
indeed
since
until
now
but
in
the
meantime
by
royal
orders
a
great
portion
of
the
plunder
taken
from
the
camp
had
been
restored
to
him
considerably
more
indeed
than
he
had
expected
and
now
he
and
tyisandhlu
were
seated
once
more
together
in
the
royal
dwelling
this
time
alone
but
to
be
sprung
from
an
ancient
tree
avails
a
man
nothing
in
my
country
if
he
is
poor
went
on
laurence
rather
is
it
a
disadvantage
and
he
had
better
have
been
born
among
the
meaner
sort
that
is
why
i
have
found
my
way
hither
ndabezita
that
is
why
and
you
have
gained
the
desired
riches
said
the
king
eyeing
him
narrowly
i
had
nearly
when
the
fell
upon
my
camp
and
killed
my
people
and
my
slaves
now
having
lost
all
i
care
not
to
return
to
my
own
land
but
could
you
return
rich
you
would
care
so
to
return
that
is
so
root
of
a
royal
tree
with
large
possessions
it
is
indeed
a
pleasant
land
to
dwell
in
with
no
possessions
a
man
might
often
think
longingly
of
the
restful
sleep
of
death
that
may
well
be
said
tyisandhlu
thoughtfully
the
cold
and
the
gloom
and
the
blackness
the
fogs
and
the
smoke
the
mean
and
people
who
go
to
make
up
the
larger
portion
of
its
inhabitants
nyonyoba
i
know
more
of
your
white
people
and
their
country
than
anyone
here
dreams
and
it
is
as
you
say
without
that
which
should
raise
him
above
such
horrors
as
this
a
man
might
as
well
be
dead
wherefore
i
prefer
to
live
in
the
land
of
the
rather
than
die
in
my
own
but
whoever
brought
hither
that
description
of
our
land
told
a
wonderfully
true
tale
ruler
of
the
great
tyisandhlu
made
no
reply
but
reaching
out
his
hand
he
took
up
a
whistle
and
blew
a
double
note
upon
it
immediately
there
entered
an
let
no
man
approach
until
this
note
shall
again
sound
said
the
king
preserve
clear
a
wide
space
around
lest
the
ear
that
opens
too
wide
be
removed
from
its
owner
head
go
the
man
saluted
humbly
and
withdrew
and
then
for
long
did
they
sit
together
and
talk
in
a
low
tone
the
barbarian
monarch
and
the
white
adventurer
and
the
subject
of
their
talk
seemed
fraught
with
some
surprise
to
the
latter
but
with
satisfaction
to
both
see
now
nyonyoba
concluded
the
king
they
have
brought
you
here
here
whence
no
man
ever
returned
and
you
would
become
one
of
us
well
be
it
so
there
is
that
about
you
i
trust
whence
no
man
ever
returned
echoed
laurence
surely
ha
a
white
man
found
his
way
hither
once
but
he
was
a
preacher
and
i
love
not
such
he
never
returned
but
what
of
my
two
friends
you
will
not
harm
them
ndabezita
because
they
are
my
friends
and
we
have
fought
together
many
a
long
year
urged
laurence
i
will
spare
them
for
that
reason
they
shall
be
led
from
the
country
with
their
eyes
covered
lest
they
find
the
way
back
again
but
if
they
do
they
likewise
shall
never
depart
from
it
and
now
nyonyoba
all
i
have
told
you
is
between
ourselves
alone
breathe
not
a
whisper
of
it
or
anything
about
me
even
to
your
friends
for
the
present
farewell
and
good
fortune
be
yours

were
kept
prisoners
in
nondwana

and
save
that
they
were
not
no
especial
consideration
was
shown
them
they
were
allowed
to
wander
about
the
open
space
outside
but
watchful
eyes
were
ever
upon
them
and
did
they
venture
beyond
certain
limits
they
were
speedily
made
aware
of
the
fact
no
such
distractions
as
joining
in
the
hunting
parties
or
coming
and
going
at
will
such
as
their

enjoyed

against

deadly
monotony
of
the

in

with
a
boding
suspense
as
to
their
ultimate
fate
did
holmes
restless
spirit
mightily
chafe
indeed
at
times
he
felt
sore
and
resentful
towards
laurence
at
such
times
judicious
counsel
would
step
in
shall
we
never
make
a
philosopher
of
you
holmes
he
would
say
do
you
think
for
instance
that
stanninghame
faring
no
better
than
ourselves
would
improve
our
own
lot
any
no
rely
upon
it
his
standing
in
with
the
king
and
the
rest
of
them
is
doing
us
no
harm
in
the
long
run
i
suppose
you
right
hazon
and
it
beastly
selfish
of
one
to
look
upon
it
any
other
way
poor
holmes
would
reply
wearily
but
o
lord
this
is
deadly
work
is
there
no
way
of
getting
away
from
here
not
any
at
present
yet
you
do
suppose
i
keeping
my
eyes
or
ears
shut
do
you
we
must
watch
our
chances
and
see
and
hear
all
we
can
i
believe
tyisandhlu
is
a
decent
fellow
all
round
and
mind
you
do
come
across
plenty
of
pretty
good
fellows
even
among
savages
whatever
bosh
some
men
may
talk
to
the
contrary
but
i
do
care
for
nondwana
i
believe
he
make
short
work
of
us
if
he
dared
possibly
the
king
may
be
watching
his
opportunity
of
smuggling
us
out
of
the
country
at
any
rate
i
do
think
he
means
us
any
harm
if
only
by
reason
of
the
astonishing
fancy
he
seems
to
have
taken
to
stanninghame
this
as
we
know
was
very
near
the
truth
though
far
more
so
than
the
speakers
guessed
for
laurence
moved
both
by
inclination
and
expediency
had
rigidly
adhered
to
his
promise
of
secrecy
if
it
seemed
hard
that
he
should
be
compelled
to
shut
his
companions
out
of
his
entire
confidence
he
consoled
himself
with
the
certainty
that
their
admission
into
it
though
it
might
encourage
them
mentally
could
in
no
wise
benefit
them
materially
very
much
the
reverse
indeed
for
it
would
probably
bring
about
their
destruction
well
if
anything
is
going
to
be
done
it
had
better
be
soon
or
not
at
all
it
would
take
much
to
send
me
clean
off
my
chump
said
holmes
dejectedly
every
day
i
feel
more
inclined
to
break
out
to
run
amuck
in
a
crowd
if
only
for
the
sake
of
a
little
excitement
anything
for
a
little
excitement
the
two
were
strolling
up
and
down
outside
nondwana
kraal
it
was
a
still
hot
morning
oppressive
as
though
a
storm
were
brooding
a
filmy
haze
lay
upon
the
lower
valley
bottom
and
the
ground
gave
forth
a
shimmer
of
heat
even
the
amphitheatre
of
dazzling
omitted
to
look
cool
against
the
cloudless
blue
while
the
cliffs
seemed
actually
to
glow
as
though
red
hot
i
hate
this
growled
holmes
looking
around
upon
as
magnificent
a
scene
of
nature
grandeur
as
the
earth
could
show
positively
hate
it
i
shall
never
be
able
to
stand
the
sight
of
a
mountain
again
as
long
as
i
live
once
we
are
out
of
this
oh
heavens
look
what
a
brute
his
accents
of
shuddering
disgust
were
explained
something
was
moving
among
the
stones
in
front
something
with
great
hairy
shoggling
legs
and
a
body
the
size
of
a
thrush
and
much
the
same
colour
a
spider
could
it
be
of
such
enormous
size
yet
it
was
and
as
truly
repulsive
and
a
monster
as
ever
made
human
flesh
creep
at
beholding
whack
the
stone
flung
by
holmes
struck
the
ground
beside
the
creature
struck
it
hard
hold
you
infernal
fool
half
snarled
half
yelled
hazon
but
before
he
could
arrest
the
other
arm
whack
went
a
second
stone
the
aim
was
true
the
grisly
beast
crushed
and
maimed
lay
contracting
and
unfolding
its
horrible
legs
in
the
muscular
writhings
of
its
death
throes
what
the
row
eh
grumbled
holmes
staring
under
the
impression
that
his
comrade
had
gone
mad
and
at
first
sight
not
without
reason
for
hazon
face
had
gone
a
swarthy
white
and
his
eyes
seemed
to
glare
forth
from
it
like
blazing
coals
row
you
fool
you
signed
our
that
all
here
quick
pretend
to
be
throwing
stones
on
to
it
as
if
we
were
playing
at
some
game
do
you
see
the
name
of
this
tribe
people
of
the
spider
they
venerate
the
beast
if
we
have
been
seen
nothing
can
save
us
oh
heavens
cried
holmes
aghast
as
the
whole
ugly
truth
dawned
upon
him
setting
to
with
a
will
to
pile
stones
upon
the
remains
of
the
slain
and
shattered
monster
too
late
growled
hazon
we
have
been
seen
look
several
women
were
running
stealthily
and
in
alarm
towards
the
gate
and
immediately
a
frightful
uproar
arose
from
within
armed
with
sticks
and
spears
the
warriors
came
pouring
forth
and
in
a
moment
had
surrounded
the
two
a
howling
infuriated
threatening
mob
although
expecting
nothing
less
than
instant
death
with
the
emergency
hazon
coolness
had
returned
he
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
appalling
uproar
apparently
unmoved
holmes
on
the
other
hand
looked
wildly
around
but
less
in
fear
than
in
desperation
he
was
calculating
his
chances
of
being
able
to
snatch
a
weapon
from
one
of
them
and
to
lay
about
him
in
the
last
fierce
battle
for
life
anything
for
a
little
excitement
he
had
said
in
very
truth
his
aspiration
was
realized
there
was
excitement
enough
in
the
brandished
spears
and
blazing
eyeballs
in
the
infuriated
demoniacal
faces
in
the
deafening
roaring
clamour
this
is
no
matter
for
you
cried
hazon
in
firm
ringing
tones
take
us
to
the
king
we
can
explain
the
affair
was
an
accident
at
this
the
ferocious
tumult
redoubled
an
accident
they
had
lifted
their
hand
against
the
great
tutelary
spider
that
guarded
house
an
accident
hold
to
the
king
let
them
be
taken
interposed
a
strong
deep
voice
and
extending
his
hands
as
though
to
arrest
the
uplifted
weapons
nondwana
himself
stalked
into
the
circle
there
was
no
gainsaying
the
mandate
of
one
so
great
weapons
were
lowered
but
still
vociferating
horrible
threats
the
crowd
with
the
two
offenders
in
its
midst
moved
in
the
direction
of
imvungayo
but
it
seemed
as
though
the
wild
pealing
shouts
of
rage
and
consternation
were
a
very
tocsin
for
now
from
every
kraal
near
and
far
the
inhabitants
came
surging
forth
streaming
down
the
hillsides
over
the
face
of
the
plain
like
swarming
ants
and
before
they
reached
imvungayo
the
two
whites
seemed
to
move
in
the
midst
of
a
huge
sea
of
gibing
infuriated
faces
as
the
dark
crowd
gathering
volume
poured
onward
rending
the
air
with
deafening
shouts
of
execration
and
menace
but
the
royal
guards
barred
the
gate
suffering
no
entrance
save
on
the
part
of
the
two
white
men
together
with
nondwana
and
a
few
of
the
greater
among
the
people
this
is
the
tightest
place
we
have
been
in
yet
murmured
hazon
to
tread
on
the
superstitions
of
any
race
is
to
thrust
one
head
into
the
jaws
of
a
starved
lion
d
their
filthy
superstition
said
holmes
savagely
desperate
well
i
did
the
thing
so
i
suppose
i
shall
be
the
one
to
suffer
the
other
said
nothing
he
had
a
shrewd
suspicion
that
more
than
one
life
would
be
required
in
atonement
but
he
and
death
had
stared
each
other
in
the
face
so
frequently
that
once
more
or
less
did
not
greatly
matter
on
learning
the
cause
of
the
tumult
tyisandhlu
had
come
forth
and
now
sat
as
he
frequently
did
to
administer
justice
at
the
head
of
the
great
central
space
when
the
shouts
of
which
greeted
his
presence
had
subsided
he
ordered
that
the
two
whites
should
be
brought
forward
this
was
the
first
time
the
latter
had
seen
the
king
and
now
as
they
beheld
his
stately
commanding
bearing
calm
and
judicial
both
of
them
holmes
especially
began
to
hope
they
would
explain
the
matter
and
offer
ample
apologies
the
owner
of
that
fine
intellectual
countenance
savage
though
he
might
be
called
he
surely
had
a
soul
above
the
debased
superstitions
of
his
subjects
hitherto
he
had
spared
their
lives
surely
now
he
would
not
sacrifice
them
to
the
clamour
of
a
mob
yet
as
hazon
had
said
to
tread
on
the
superstitions
of
any
race
was
the
most
fatal
thing
on
earth
what
is
this
that
has
been
done
spoke
the
king
when
he
had
heard
all
that
the
accusers
had
to
say
surely
no
such
deed
has
been
wrought
among
us
since
the
have
been
a
nation
there
was
a
sternness
a
menace
even
in
the
full
deep
voice
that
dispelled
all
hope
in
the
minds
of
the
two
thus
under
judgment
they
had
committed
the
one
unpardonable
sin
in
vain
hazon
elaborately
explained
the
whole
affair
diplomatically
setting
forth
that
the
act
being
accidental
and
done
by
strangers
and
white
people
in
ignorance
no
need
befall
the
nation
as
might
be
the
case
were
the
symbol
of
its
veneration
offended
by
its
own
people
the
voice
of
the
king
was
more
stern
than
before
almost
jeering
accidental
he
repeated
even
though
it
be
so
accidents
often
bring
greater
evil
in
their
results
than
the
most
deliberate
for
such
is
the
rule
of
life
that
is
so
buzzed
the
indunas
grouped
on
either
side
of
the
king
hear
the
wisdom
of
the
burning
north
wind
well
then
in
this
matter
atonement
must
be
made
it
appears
that
one
only
was
concerned
in
it
and
that
one
is
nomtyeketye
this
was
the
somewhat
uncomplimentary
by
which
holmes
was
known
bestowed
upon
him
on
account
of
his
talkative
tendencies
as
contrasted
with
the
laconic
sententiousness
of
hazon
i
rule
therefore
went
on
the
king
that
nomtyeketye
taken
hence
to
where
atonement
is
the
other
may
depart
from
among
us
to
his
own
land
a
shout
of
approval
rose
from
the
vast
crowd
without
as
the
decision
became
known
some
there
were
who
clamoured
for
two
victims
but
the
king
decision
was
not
lightly
to
be
questioned
and
before
the
shout
had
died
into
a
murmur
the
whole
multitude
of
hideous
black
figures
in
their
weird
disguise
came
bounding
across
the
open
space
to
seize
their
victim
but
before
they
could
surround
the
latter
an
interruption
occurred
hold
cried
a
loud
voice
i
have
a
favour
to
ask
the
king
i
who
bear
the
sign
and
laurence
who
in
the
midst
of
one
of
the
listening
groups
had
been
unseen
hitherto
now
came
forward
none
hindering
and
stood
before
the
king
a
deep
silence
was
upon
all
every
head
was
bent
forward
the
frightful
priesthood
of
the
demon
paused
with
staring
eyes
to
wait
on
what
new
turn
events
would
take
say
on
nyonyoba
said
tyisandhlu
shortly
looking
anything
but
pleased
at
the
interruption
it
is
this
o
burning
wind
let
nomtyeketye
return
to
his
own
people
i
will
take
his
place
you
exclaimed
the
king
as
a
gasp
of
amazement
shivered
through
the
listeners
yes
hearken
ndabezita
i
it
was
who
brought
him
hither
he
is
young
and
his
life
is
all
before
him
mine
is
all
behind
me
and
has
been
no
great
gain
at
that
i
will
proceed
with
these
with
a
glance
in
the
direction
of
the
blackly
horrible
group
to
where
atonement
is
offered
but
let
the
two
return
together
to
their
own
land
pause
nyonyoba
pause
and
think
said
the
king
speaking
in
a
deep
and
solemn
voice
that
which
awaits
you
if
i
grant
your
request
is
of
no
light
order
men
have
sought
their
own
death
rather
than
face
it
pause
i
say
then
rapidly
and
speaking
very
low
even
i
can
not
save
you
there
it
may
be
that
the
sign
itself
can
not
now
what
moved
him
to
an
act
of
heroic
laurence
stanninghame
hardly
knew
himself
it
may
have
been
that
he
did
not
appreciate
its
magnitude
it
may
have
been
that
he
held
more
than
a
lingering
belief
that
the
king
would
find
some
secret
means
for
his
deliverance
whereas
to
his
younger
comrade
no
such
way
of
escape
lay
open
or
was
it
that
at
this
moment
certain
words
spoken
long
ago
in
warning
now
stood
forth
clear
and
in
flaming
letters
upon
his
brain
men
have
gone
up
country
with
hazon
but
not
one
of
them
has
ever
returned
he
himself
abiding
henceforward
among
the
and
holmes
consigned
to
the
mysterious
doom
would
not
those
warning
words
be
carried
out
in
all
their
fell
fatality
but
that
after
these
years
of
hardening
in
the
lurid
school
of
bloodshed
and
ruthlessness
he
should
be
capable
of
sacrificing
himself
for
another
through
motives
of
impulsive
generosity
laurence
could
not
have
brought
himself
to
believe
indeed
he
could
not
have
defined
his
own
motives
give
me
your
word
great
great
one
in
the
sight
of
the
whole
nation
he
said
in
a
loud
voice
that
these
two
shall
be
suffered
to
depart
unharmed
now
at
once
and
i
will
take
the
place
of
nomtyeketye
that
will
i
readily
do
nyonyoba
for
i
have
no
need
of
strangers
here
such
as
these
answered
tyisandhlu
then
sadly
and
you
are
resolved
i
am
then
it
must
be
for
ye
two
go
in
peace
enough
shall
be
given
you
for
your
journey
holmes
who
understood
the
language
very
imperfectly
had
no
clear
notion
even
then
of
what
had
taken
place
but
when
he
saw
the
gigantic
forms
in
their
black
disguise
bounding
forward
to
surround
laurence
he
being
otherwise
unarmed
instinctively
threw
himself
into
a
boxing
attitude
which
was
under
the
circumstances
ridiculous
if
natural
keep
cool
you
young
idiot
snarled
hazon
we
out
of
this
mess
better
than
we
deserve
why
what
happened
stanninghame
is
acting
substitute
for
you
and
we
are
to
be
fired
out
of
the
country
which
is
good
news
to
you
i
take
it
but
i
ca
allow
it
cried
holmes
bewilderedly
as
the
truth
began
to
dawn
upon
him
no
hang
it
i
ca
tell
the
king
i
no
good
keep
your
hair
on
and
remember
too
it
more
than
probable
he
wo
come
to
any
harm
he
stands
in
with
them
too
well
holmes
more
than
half
reassured
suffered
himself
to
be
persuaded
especially
as
he
was
powerless
to
do
anything
at
all
but
whether
hazon
believed
or
not
in
what
he
had
just
advanced
must
remain
forever
locked
up
as
a
mystery
in
the
breast
of
that
inscrutable
individual
one
thing
however
he
did
not
believe
in
and
that
was
in
he
himself
suffering
for
the
foolishness
of
other
people
meanwhile
laurence
in
the
midst
of
his
disguised
executioners
was
pursued
by
the
howling
and
execrations
of
the
crowds
which
parted
eagerly
to
make
way
for
their
passage
outside
on
the
open
plain
a
vast
mob
of
women
had
collected
yelling
shrilly
at
him
and
even
pelting
him
with
earth
and
sticks
one
of
the
latter
thrown
at
close
quarters
hurling
over
the
heads
of
his
guards
struck
him
on
the
shoulder
painfully
and
hard
he
looked
up
it
had
been
hurled
by
the
hand
of
lindela
and
as
he
met
her
eyes
full
the
face
which
he
had
last
looked
upon
softening
and
glowing
with
the
wondrous
light
of
love
was
now
wreathed
into
a
horrible
grin
of
hate
and
savagery

the
place
of
the
horror
was
he
awake
asleep
and
dreaming
or
dead
all
these
questions
did
laurence
stanninghame
ask
himself
by
turn
as
he
recovered
his
confused
and
scattered
senses
and
there
was
abundant
scope
for
such
conjecture
for
in
truth
the
place
wherein
he
found
himself
was
a
strange
one
a
wall
of
rock
arose
on
either
side
of
him
one
straight
perpendicular
the
other
overhanging
arching
out
above
the
first
as
he
lay
there
in
the
his
first
thought
was
that
he
was
in
a
cave
a
further
glance
however
convinced
him
that
the
place
was
a
gigantic
fissure
or
rift
but
how
had
he
come
there
with
an
effort
for
he
still
felt
strangely
languid
and
confused
he
sent
his
mind
back
to
the
events
of
the
previous
day
stay
though
was
it
the
previous
day
somehow
it
seemed
much
longer
ago
he
remembered
the
long
hurried
march
into
the
heart
of
the
mountains
with
his
gruesome
escort
he
remembered
partaking
of
a
plentiful
meal
and
some
excellent
this
he
had
done
with
a
view
to
keeping
up
his
strength
which
he
might
need
to
the
full
then
he
remembered
no
more
the
liquor
had
been
drugged
he
decided
but
to
what
end
to
what
end
indeed
was
he
there
how
had
he
been
brought
there
he
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
and
looked
around
he
started
a
large
bundle
lay
beside
him
something
rolled
up
in
a
native
blanket
speedily
undoing
this
he
discovered
several
grass
baskets
with
lids
these
contained
pounded
corn
such
as
is
eaten
with
or
curdled
milk
and
indeed
a
large
calabash
of
the
latter
tightly
stoppered
was
among
the
stores
well
whatever
was
to
become
of
him
he
was
not
to
starve
anyhow
but
was
he
only
being
fattened
for
a
worse
fate
then
a
thought
struck
him
which
set
all
his
pulses
tingling
into
renewed
life
he
too
had
been
sent
out
of
the
country
and
these
stores
were
to
last
him
for
at
any
rate
part
of
his
journey
true
the
prospect
was
anything
but
an
exhilarating
one
seeing
that
he
was
unarmed
and
had
but
the
vaguest
idea
which
way
to
turn
that
the
country
was
surrounded
by
ferocious
and
hostile
races
but
then
everything
is
relative
in
this
world
and
to
a
man
who
has
spent
hours
of
a
long
day
journeying
towards
a
mysterious
horrible
and
certain
death
the
discovery
of
release
and
life
even
with
such
slender
chances
was
joy
after
the
boding
dread
which
those
long
hours
had
held
for
him
yes
that
was
it
of
course
tyisandhlu
had
not
been
faithless
to
the
friendship
between
them
while
openly
consenting
to
his
sacrifice
for
even
the
king
dare
not
in
such
a
matter
run
counter
to
the
feelings
of
the
nation
tyisandhlu
had
given
secret
orders
that
he
should
be
smuggled
out
of
the
country
having
arrived
at
this
conclusion
it
occurred
to
laurence
that
he
might
as
well
explore
a
little
he
would
leave
his
stores
here
for
the
present
for
a
glance
served
to
show
that
the
rift
or
fissure
ended
there
so
taking
only
a
handful
of
the
pounded
corn
to
eat
as
he
walked
he
started
at
once
but
there
was
a
something
a
cold
creepiness
in
the
air
perhaps
that
quelled
much
of
his
hope
the
rift
seemed
to
form
a
kind
of
circle
for
he
walked
on
and
on
ever
trending
to
the
right
never
able
to
see
more
than
a
short
distance
in
front
never
able
to
behold
the
sky
there
was
something
silently
horribly
eloquent
in
the
grim
sameness
of
those
tomblike
walls
just
then
to
his
relief
the
widened
into
light
the
cliffs
no
longer
overhung
each
other
a
narrow
strip
of
sky
became
visible
and
in
front
the
open
daylight
but
with
the
joy
of
the
discovery
another
sight
met
his
gaze
a
sight
which
sent
the
blood
tingling
through
his
veins
yet
at
first
glance
it
was
not
a
particularly
moving
one
on
the
ground
at
his
feet
lay
two
pebbles
of
a
bluish
gray
but
as
the
next
moment
he
held
them
in
his
hands
laurence
knew
that
he
held
in
a
moment
what
he
had
gone
through
years
of
privation
and
ruthless
bloodshed
to
obtain
wealth
to
wit
for
these
two
unobtrusive
pebbles
were
in
fact
splendid
diamonds
more
of
them
of
course
there
were
the
exploration
could
wait
a
little
longer
an
accident
might
cut
him
off
from
this
spot
might
cut
him
off
from
such
a
chance
forever
the
hands
of
the
seasoned
adventurer
trembled
like
those
of
a
palsied
old
woman
as
he
turned
over
the
loose
soil
with
his
foot
for
instrument
of
any
kind
he
had
none
and
indeed
his
agitation
was
not
surprising
for
in
less
than
an
hour
laurence
was
in
possession
of
eight
more
splendid
stones
as
large
as
the
first
besides
a
number
of
small
ones
he
knew
that
he
held
that
which
should
enable
him
to
pass
the
remainder
of
his
life
in
wealth
and
ease
could
he
once
get
safe
away
could
he
ah
there
came
in
the
dead
weight
the
fulfilling
of
that
strange
irony
of
fate
which
invariably
wills
that
the
good
of
life
comes
to
us
a
trifle
too
late
for
his
search
had
brought
him
quite
into
the
open
day
once
more
before
him
lay
a
valley
or
rather
hollow
of
no
great
size
and
it
was
shut
in
completely
walled
in
by
an
amphitheatre
of
lofty
cliffs
cliffs
on
all
sides
at
some
points
smooth
and
perpendicular
at
others
actually
overhanging
at
others
again
craggy
and
broken
into
terraces
but
even
with
the
proper
appliances
probably
unscalable
that
detail
his
practised
eye
could
take
in
at
a
glance
how
then
should
he
hope
to
scale
them
absolutely
devoid
as
he
was
of
so
much
as
a
stick
let
alone
a
cord
a
cord
how
had
he
been
brought
there
had
he
been
let
down
by
a
cord
or
brought
in
by
some
secret
entrance
the
latter
appeared
more
probable
and
that
entrance
he
would
find
would
find
and
traverse
be
its
risks
be
its
terrors
what
they
might
he
had
that
upon
him
now
which
rendered
life
worth
any
struggle
to
preserve
he
stepped
forth
the
sky
was
over
his
head
once
more
clear
and
blue
that
was
something
by
the
slant
of
the
sunrays
he
judged
it
must
be
about
the
middle
of
afternoon
the
floor
of
the
hollow
was
bumpy
and
uneven
sparse
and
grass
bents
sprung
from
the
soil
but
no
larger
vegetation
no
trees
no
brush
stranger
still
there
was
no
sign
of
life
even
of
bird
or
insect
life
an
evil
haunted
silence
seemed
to
brood
over
the
great
hollow
the
silence
became
weighty
oppressive
laurence
in
spite
of
himself
felt
it
steal
upon
his
nerves
and
began
to
whistle
a
lively
tune
as
he
walked
slowly
around
examining
the
cliffs
and
every
crack
and
cranny
with
critical
eye
the
echoing
notes
reverberated
weirdly
among
the
brooding
rocks
suddenly
his
foot
struck
something
something
hard
he
looked
down
and
could
not
repress
a
start
there
at
his
feet
grinning
up
at
him
lay
a
human
skull
nay
more
a
complete
skeleton
it
was
a
gruesome
find
under
the
circumstances
laurence
his
nerves
unstrung
by
the
effects
of
the
drug
and
recent
alternations
of
exultation
and
what
was
akin
to
despair
felt
his
flesh
creep
what
did
it
mean
why
that
no
way
of
escape
did
this
valley
of
death
afford
this
former
victim
had
he
been
placed
there
in
the
same
way
as
himself
and
all
means
of
exit
failing
had
succumbed
to
starvation
when
his
provisions
were
exhausted
it
looked
that
way
bending
down
he
examined
this
sorry
relic
of
humanity
examined
it
long
and
carefully
no
bone
was
broken
the
skeleton
was
almost
complete
where
it
was
not
the
joints
had
fallen
asunder
without
wrench
and
the
smooth
round
cranium
showed
not
the
slightest
sign
of
abrasion
or
blow
with
sinking
heart
he
pursued
his
search
yet
somehow
his
attention
now
was
given
but
languidly
to
potential
means
of
exit
which
the
faces
of
the
cliffs
might
afford
something
seemed
irresistibly
to
draw
it
to
the
ground
ha
that
was
it
again
that
horrid
gleam
of
whitened
bones
another
skeleton
lay
before
him
and
look
another
and
another
at
short
distances
apart
all
these
like
the
first
were
unshattered
uninjured
but
the
whole
area
here
was
strewn
with
skulls
yellow
and
brown
with
age
was
strewn
with
bones
also
mossy
and
which
crackled
under
his
tread
no
one
could
be
more
ruthless
more
callous
no
man
could
view
scenes
of
cruelty
and
bloodshed
more
unmoved
than
laurence
stanninghame
as
we
have
shown
or
bear
his
part
more
coolly
and
effectively
in
the
fiercest
conflict
yet
there
was
something
in
these
silent
human
relics
lying
there
bloodless
in
the
unnatural
haunted
silence
of
this
dreadful
that
caused
his
flesh
to
creep
then
he
noticed
that
all
were
lying
along
the
slope
of
a
ridge
which
ran
right
across
the
hollow
dividing
the
floor
of
the
same
into
two
sections
he
must
needs
go
over
that
ridge
to
complete
his
explorations
yet
now
he
shrank
from
it
with
awe
and
repugnance
which
in
any
other
man
he
would
have
defined
as
little
short
of
terror
what
would
await
him
on
the
other
side
well
he
must
go
through
with
it
probably
he
would
find
more
of
such
ghastly
relics
that
was
all
but
as
he
stood
upon
the
apex
of
the
ridge
with
pulses
somewhat
quickened
no
whitening
bones
met
his
gaze
fixed
dilated
as
that
gaze
was
the
cliff
in
front
he
thought
to
descry
some
faint
chance
of
escape
there
for
its
face
was
terraced
and
sloping
backward
somewhat
moreover
it
was
rent
by
crannies
and
crevices
which
to
a
desperate
and
determined
man
might
afford
hand
and
foothold
and
now
for
the
first
time
it
flashed
upon
laurence
that
the
mystery
of
the
spider
stood
explained
this
horrible
hole
whence
there
was
no
escape
where
men
were
thrust
to
die
by
inches
as
all
of
these
had
died
before
him
the
repulsive
and
insect
was
in
truth
a
fitting
name
allegorically
for
such
a
place
which
swallowed
up
the
lives
of
men
besides
for
all
he
knew
the
configuration
of
the
crater
might
from
above
resemble
the
tutelary
insect
of
the
yes
he
had
solved
the
mystery
as
to
that
he
was
confident
the
next
thing
to
do
was
to
find
some
way
out
to
break
through
the
fatality
of
the
place
for
the
first
time
now
his
shoulder
began
to
feel
stiff
and
sore
where
the
stick
hurled
by
lindela
had
struck
him
that
was
a
bad
preparation
for
the
most
perilous
kind
of
then
the
incident
recalled
to
mind
lindela
herself
her
sudden
change
of
front
was
just
such
an
oddity
as
any
of
the
incidents
which
go
to
make
up
the
sum
of
life
experiences
well
savage
or
civilized
human
nature
was
singularly
alike
a
touch
of
superstition
and
the
god
of
yesterday
became
the
demon
of
thus
musing
he
came
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
upon
another
skeleton
but
the
effect
of
the
discovery
of
this
was
even
more
disconcerting
than
that
of
the
first
for
around
lay
rotting
rags
of
clothing
and
a
gold
ornament
or
two
these
remains
he
recognized
at
a
glance
they
were
those
of
lutali
yes
here
was
a
broad
bracelet
of
gold
curiously
worked
with
the
text
of
the
koran
which
he
had
seen
last
on
the
arab
sinewy
wrist
now
that
wrist
was
but
a
grisly
bone
there
too
were
parchment
strips
also
inscribed
with
koran
passages
and
worn
in
a
pouch
as
amulets
the
identity
of
these
remains
was
established
beyond
a
doubt
but
the
discovery
inspired
within
him
a
renewed
chill
of
despair
if
lutali
had
been
unable
to
find
means
of
escape
how
should
he
the
arab
was
a
man
of
great
readiness
of
resource
of
indomitable
courage
and
powerfully
built
if
such
a
one
had
succumbed
why
should
he
laurence
fare
any
better
he
sat
down
once
more
and
gazing
upon
the
sorry
remnant
of
his
late
confederate
began
to
think
what
a
strange
vast
practical
joke
was
that
thing
called
life
here
was
he
at
the
end
of
it
and
the
very
means
of
ending
it
for
him
had
at
the
same
time
put
him
into
possession
of
that
which
rendered
it
worth
having
at
all
he
felt
the
stones
lying
hard
and
angular
in
his
pockets
he
even
took
out
one
of
them
and
turned
it
over
sadly
in
his
hands
he
would
gladly
give
a
portion
of
these
to
be
standing
on
the
summit
of
yonder
cliff
instead
of
at
the
base
not
yet
had
he
come
to
feel
he
would
gladly
give
them
all
it
was
only
of
a
continuance
with
what
life
had
brought
him
that
he
should
be
there
at
all
he
had
sacrificed
himself
for
another
the
sublimity
of
the
act
even
yet
did
not
strike
him
he
regarded
it
as
the
first
because
his
cynical
creed
was
bolstered
up
by
the
consciousness
that
holmes
would
never
more
than
half
appreciate
it
the
last
because
well
all
unselfishness
all
consideration
was
idiotic
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
would
be
time
enough
to
sit
down
and
dream
when
he
had
exhausted
all
expedients
and
he
had
not
explored
that
side
of
the
hollow
at
all
yet
to
this
end
he
moved
forward
a
very
brief
scrutiny
however
of
the
face
of
the
cliff
sufficed
to
show
that
for
climbing
purposes
the
cracks
and
crannies
were
useless
ha
what
was
this
a
cave
or
a
rift
right
in
front
of
him
the
cliff
yawned
in
just
such
a
rift
as
the
one
in
which
he
had
awakened
to
find
himself
only
not
on
anything
like
such
a
large
scale
eagerly
laurence
plunged
into
this
here
might
be
a
way
to
the
outer
world
to
safety
he
pressed
onward
in
the
the
rocks
darkened
overhead
forming
in
effect
a
cave
and
now
it
seemed
that
he
could
hear
a
strange
soft
scraping
a
kind
of
sighing
noise
a
was
his
first
thought
looking
around
for
the
reptile
but
no
such
reptile
lay
in
his
path
and
he
had
no
means
of
striking
a
light
with
a
dull
shrinking
his
flesh
creeping
with
a
strange
foreboding
as
with
the
consciousness
of
some
fearful
prescience
he
decided
to
push
on
being
careful
however
to
tread
warily
this
was
no
time
for
sticking
at
trifles
but
as
he
advanced
the
air
became
foetid
with
a
strange
pungent
nauseous
odour
there
were
lateral
clefts
branching
off
the
main
gallery
but
of
no
depth
and
to
these
he
had
given
but
small
notice
now
however
something
occurred
of
so
appalling
a
nature
that
he
stood
as
one
turned
to
stone
there
shot
out
from
one
of
these
lateral
recesses
two
enormous
tentacles
black
wavy
as
serpents
covered
with
hair
armed
at
the
extremity
with
a
strong
double
claw
they
reached
forth
noiselessly
to
within
a
couple
of
yards
of
where
he
stood
then
two
more
followed
with
a
quick
wavy
jerk
and
now
behind
these
a
head
as
large
as
that
of
a
man
black
hairy
bearing
a
strange
resemblance
to
the
most
awful
and
cruel
human
face
ever
stamped
with
the
devil
image
whose
dull
goggle
eyes
fixed
on
the
appalled
ones
of
its
discoverer
seemed
to
glow
and
burn
with
a
truly
diabolical
glare
laurence
stood
staring
into
the
countenance
of
this
awful
thing
his
blood
curdled
to
ice
within
him
his
hair
literally
standing
up
was
it
the
fiend
himself
who
had
taken
such
unknown
and
fearful
shape
to
appear
before
him
here
in
the
gloom
of
this
foul
and
loathsome
cavern
then
as
his
eyes
grew
more
and
more
used
to
the
dim
shades
he
made
out
a
huge
body
crouched
back
in
the
recess
half
hidden
by
a
quivering
mass
of
black
hairy
tentacles
for
a
few
moments
thus
he
stood
then
with
a
cry
of
horror
he
threw
out
his
hand
as
though
instinctively
to
ward
off
an
attack
the
four
tentacles
already
protruded
were
quickly
withdrawn
and
the
fearful
creature
whatever
it
was
seemed
to
shrink
back
into
the
cranny
one
last
look
upon
the
hairy
heap
of
moving
writhing
horror
upon
those
dreadful
demon
eyes
and
this
man
who
had
faced
death
again
and
again
without
shrinking
now
felt
it
all
he
could
do
to
resist
an
impulse
to
turn
and
flee
like
a
hunted
hare
he
did
however
resist
it
yet
it
was
with
flesh
shuddering
and
knees
trembling
beneath
him
that
he
withdrew
step
by
step
backwards
until
he
stood
once
more
in
the
full
light
of
day
chapter
xxvii
the
horror
vampire
insect
devil
what
the
thing
from
the
length
and
thickness
of
those
frightful
legs
stretching
forth
from
the
cranny
laurence
who
had
not
halted
until
he
had
gained
the
ridge
dividing
the
hollow
estimated
that
the
creature
when
spread
out
must
be
eight
or
ten
feet
in
diameter
he
looked
back
it
had
not
followed
him
from
the
cave
why
had
it
not
was
it
waiting
for
night
to
steal
upon
him
in
the
darkness
to
wreath
around
him
those
terrible
tentacles
and
to
drain
his
now
indeed
all
stood
clear
the
spider
was
no
allegorical
term
but
literal
fact
that
frightful
monster
with
which
he
had
just
come
face
to
face
was
indeed
the
of
the
it
was
actually
fed
with
living
men
in
accordance
with
some
dark
and
mysterious
superstition
held
by
that
otherwise
fine
race
now
the
fate
of
those
whose
skeletons
lay
around
stood
accounted
for
they
had
been
devoured
by
this
unimaginable
horror
alive
it
was
almost
certain
possibly
when
weakened
by
starvation
yet
a
gruesome
thought
entered
his
mind
why
had
an
abundance
of
food
been
lowered
with
him
into
this
did
not
the
circumstance
make
as
though
it
was
in
their
full
vigour
that
the
monster
was
designed
to
seize
its
victims
and
in
that
event
with
what
an
extent
of
strength
and
fell
ferocity
must
it
not
be
endowed
but
what
this
thing
laurence
had
seen
spiders
of
every
variety
huge
and
venomous
and
of
grisly
size
yet
nothing
like
this
why
the
creature
was
as
large
as
a
bear
nearly
it
must
be
some
beast
hitherto
unknown
to
natural
history
yet
those
awful
tentacles
joints
hair
everything
could
not
but
belong
to
an
insect
were
in
fact
precisely
as
the
legs
of
a
huge
tarantula
magnified
five
what
ghastly
and
freak
of
nature
could
have
produced
such
a
monstrosity
as
this
why
the
very
sight
of
the
awful
thing
huddled
up
black
within
the
gloom
of
the
cranny
the
horrid
tentacles
a
more
repulsive
more
than
though
they
actually
were
so
many
serpents
moving
and
writhing
in
a
great
quivering
hairy
intertwined
mass
was
in
itself
a
sight
to
haunt
his
dreams
until
his
dying
day
did
he
live
another
fifty
years
what
must
it
mean
then
to
realize
that
he
was
actually
shut
in
escape
impossible
with
the
deliberate
purpose
of
being
devoured
by
this
vampire
this
demon
even
as
all
these
others
had
been
devoured
before
him
at
this
juncture
of
his
meditations
his
mind
became
alive
to
two
discoveries
one
that
he
had
gained
the
farther
end
of
the
ridge
than
that
by
which
he
had
crossed
the
other
that
immediately
before
and
beneath
him
just
over
the
slope
of
the
ridge
lay
the
body
of
a
man
yes
the
body
of
a
man
not
the
skeleton
of
one
that
it
was
that
of
a
dead
man
he
could
see
at
a
glance
also
that
it
was
one
of
the
with
a
shudder
he
remembered
the
luckless
wretch
he
had
seen
dragged
away
but
a
day
or
two
before
his
own
seizure
whether
for
or
as
a
customary
sacrifice
he
had
been
condemned
to
this
laurence
had
not
inquired
at
the
time
casting
one
more
look
at
the
cave
and
satisfying
himself
that
the
monster
had
not
emerged
laurence
went
down
to
examine
the
body
it
was
that
of
a
man
in
the
prime
of
life
and
wearing
the
it
was
lying
on
its
back
the
throat
upturned
and
protruding
and
then
laurence
shudderingly
noticed
two
round
gaping
orifices
at
the
base
of
the
throat
clearly
where
the
great
nippers
of
the
monster
had
punctured
the
limbs
too
were
scratched
and
scored
as
though
with
claws
and
upon
the
dead
face
was
such
an
awful
expression
of
the
very
extremity
of
horror
and
dread
as
the
spectator
accustomed
as
he
was
to
such
sights
had
never
beheld
stamped
on
the
human
countenance
before
and
beholding
it
now
laurence
stanninghame
felt
that
the
perspiration
was
oozing
upon
him
at
every
pore
for
he
realized
that
he
was
looking
upon
a
foresight
of
his
own
fate
for
was
he
not
that
most
perfectly
and
completely
helpless
of
all
god
creatures
an
unarmed
man
he
had
not
so
much
as
a
stick
or
a
to
resist
the
onslaught
of
this
monster
no
not
even
a
boot
for
it
flashed
across
his
mind
at
that
moment
that
a
good
heel
might
be
better
than
nothing
he
was
wearing
only
a
pair
of
ordinary
hide
shoes
to
wit
there
were
not
even
stones
lying
about
the
ground
save
very
small
ones
and
he
had
no
means
of
loosening
rock
slabs
large
enough
to
serve
as
weapons
there
was
no
place
of
refuge
to
climb
into
afforded
by
ledges
or
pinnacles
of
rock
and
even
were
there
why
the
thing
could
surely
come
up
after
him
as
easily
as
the
common
tarantula
could
run
up
a
wall
nothing
is
more
completely
demoralizing
than
the
helplessness
of
an
unarmed
man
with
his
express
or
his
this
one
would
have
regarded
the
situation
in
the
light
of
a
wholly
new
and
adventurous
excitement
with
even
a
large
knife
he
would
have
been
willing
to
take
his
chances
but
he
was
totally
unarmed
it
seemed
to
laurence
that
in
that
brief
while
he
had
lived
a
lifetime
of
mortal
fear
then
with
a
mighty
effort
he
pulled
himself
together
he
would
return
to
where
he
had
left
his
stores
ere
commencing
the
exploration
nobody
ever
yet
improved
a
situation
of
peril
by
starving
himself
yet
as
he
wended
his
way
up
the
long
chasm
wherein
he
had
first
awakened
to
life
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
shuddering
repulsion
the
place
bore
such
a
close
resemblance
now
to
that
other
cave
yet
here
at
any
rate
he
knew
there
was
nothing
he
opened
the
corn
baskets
and
the
calabash
of
and
made
a
fairly
good
meal
then
by
the
glooming
shades
of
the
overhanging
rock
he
judged
that
daylight
was
waning
out
into
the
open
once
more
the
open
air
might
render
such
a
struggle
with
the
monster
a
trifle
less
horrible
than
here
shut
in
by
these
rock
walls
the
gray
of
the
brief
twilight
was
upon
the
faces
of
the
surrounding
cliffs
which
soon
faded
into
misty
gloom
only
the
stars
leaping
into
the
misty
gloom
only
the
stars
leaping
forth
into
the
inky
sky
shed
an
indistinct
light
into
this
vault
of
horror
and
of
death
he
was
shut
in
here
and
shut
in
with
this
awful
thing
which
should
find
him
out
during
the
hours
of
darkness
and
marvellous
to
tell
a
sudden
drowsiness
came
upon
him
and
whether
the
effects
of
the
drug
still
lingered
about
him
or
was
it
the
reaction
from
an
overstrained
mind
he
actually
slept
slept
hard
and
dreamlessly
suddenly
he
awoke
awoke
with
the
weight
of
an
indefinable
terror
upon
him
a
broad
moon
in
its
third
quarter
was
sailing
aloft
in
the
heavens
flooding
the
hollow
with
its
ghostly
light
instinctively
he
sprang
to
his
feet
as
he
did
so
there
came
upon
him
a
resistless
and
shuddering
fear
akin
to
that
which
had
paralyzed
him
in
the
cave
what
was
it
the
magnetic
proximity
of
the
awful
thing
stealthily
stalking
him
no
the
reason
now
lay
clear
in
the
moonlight
he
could
make
out
shadowy
and
indistinct
the
corpse
he
had
found
during
the
afternoon
but
as
he
gazed
a
change
seemed
to
have
come
over
it
it
had
increased
in
size
had
more
than
doubled
its
bulk
heavens
the
dark
mass
began
to
move
to
heave
and
then
he
thought
the
very
acme
of
horror
was
reached
not
one
body
was
there
but
two
spread
out
over
the
human
body
was
that
of
the
monster
now
he
could
make
out
almost
every
detail
of
its
hideous
shape
the
convulsive
working
of
the
frightful
tentacles
as
it
devoured
its
lifeless
prey
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
his
brain
was
bursting
he
must
do
something
raising
his
voice
he
shouted
shouted
as
assuredly
he
had
never
shouted
in
his
life
there
was
a
maniacal
ring
in
his
voice
he
felt
as
though
he
must
rush
right
at
this
thing
of
fear
was
he
really
going
mad
well
it
began
to
look
like
it
but
the
effect
was
prompt
the
awful
vampire
gathering
its
horrible
legs
under
it
sprang
clear
of
the
carcass
it
stood
for
a
moment
in
rigid
immobility
then
ere
the
maniacal
echoes
of
that
shout
had
quavered
into
silence
among
the
cliffs
it
shoggled
over
the
ridge
and
was
lost
to
view
the
night
wore
through
somehow
and
if
ever
mortal
eyes
were
rejoiced
by
the
light
of
dawn
assuredly
they
were
those
of
laurence
stanninghame
as
once
more
he
found
himself
the
sole
living
tenant
of
that
ghastly
place
of
death
yet
to
what
end
one
more
dreary
day
in
his
rock
prison
another
night
of
horror
and
the
same
brooding
fate
awaiting
he
could
not
remain
awake
forever
even
though
the
sound
of
his
voice
thus
unexpectedly
lifted
up
had
alarmed
the
vampire
it
would
not
always
do
so
still
with
the
light
of
the
day
after
the
night
of
terror
came
some
medium
of
relief
once
more
he
drew
upon
his
provision
stores
while
repacking
them
his
gaze
rested
on
the
native
blanket
with
the
wild
idea
of
manufacturing
therefrom
a
cord
but
to
do
this
he
needed
a
knife
the
stuff
was
of
material
too
stout
for
tearing
a
knife
ha
with
the
thought
came
another
it
was
not
worth
much
but
it
was
something
and
with
that
came
a
hard
fierce
desperate
hope
the
broad
gold
bracelet
which
still
encircled
lutali
skeleton
wrist
could
not
that
be
banged
and
flattened
into
something
sharp
and
serviceable
it
was
hard
metal
anyway
still
the
grim
horror
lurked
within
its
cave
still
it
came
not
forth
it
was
waiting
until
another
night
should
embolden
it
to
seize
its
defenceless
human
prey
he
glanced
upwards
there
were
still
from
two
to
three
hours
of
daylight
in
a
very
few
moments
he
had
reached
the
skeleton
of
the
arab
and
snapping
off
the
bony
wrist
without
hesitation
the
bracelet
was
within
his
grasp
but
as
he
looked
around
for
some
means
of
flattening
it
there
flashed
in
upon
him
another
idea
a
perfectly
idea
grisly
under
ordinary
circumstances
as
it
might
be
the
bracelet
was
large
and
massive
and
for
it
a
new
use
suggested
itself
critically
examining
the
skeletons
he
selected
two
with
the
largest
and
strongest
these
he
soon
wrenched
off
and
running
one
through
the
gold
bracelet
he
jammed
the
latter
fast
against
the
thicker
end
binding
it
as
tightly
as
he
could
to
the
bulging
joint
with
a
strip
torn
from
his
clothing
with
a
thrill
of
unutterable
joy
he
realized
that
he
was
no
longer
unarmed
he
had
manufactured
a
tolerably
effective
mace
he
swung
it
through
the
air
two
or
three
times
with
all
his
force
such
a
blow
would
strike
a
human
enemy
dead
was
this
thing
so
heavily
as
to
be
proof
against
a
similar
stroke
with
one
idea
came
another
these
bones
might
be
further
utilized
they
might
be
splintered
and
sharpened
into
daggers
no
sooner
thought
of
than
carried
out
and
now
the
skeletons
underwent
the
most
ruthless
desecration
several
were
wrenched
asunder
ere
he
had
selected
half
a
dozen
of
the
most
serviceable
and
these
he
hammered
to
the
required
size
with
his
newly
constructed
mace
sharpening
them
on
the
rough
face
of
the
rock
and
then
as
with
a
glow
of
satisfaction
he
sat
down
to
rest
and
contemplate
his
handiwork
he
almost
laughed
over
the
grim
whimsicality
of
it
did
ever
mortal
man
go
into
close
conflict
armed
in
such
fashion
he
wondered
with
club
and
dagger
manufactured
out
of
the
bones
of
men
should
he
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
and
advance
boldly
to
attack
the
monster
in
its
own
den
he
shrank
from
this
the
gloom
of
the
cavern
invested
the
thing
with
an
additional
element
of
terror
besides
the
more
practical
consideration
that
a
confined
space
might
hinder
him
in
the
use
of
his
and
impromptu
weapons
he
would
need
all
the
freedom
of
hand
and
eye
once
more
he
took
out
the
metal
box
and
fed
his
eyes
long
and
earnestly
upon
its
contents
the
sign
of
the
spider
was
there
indeed
an
influence
about
this
trinket
or
rather
the
love
which
had
hallowed
it
which
was
potent
to
stand
between
him
and
peril
in
the
direst
extremity
even
as
it
had
stepped
between
him
and
certain
death
at
the
spears
of
the
victorious
slightly
improved
as
was
his
helpless
condition
yet
he
could
not
hope
even
if
he
succeeded
in
slaying
the
monster
how
should
he
escape
from
this
this
the
second
day
closed
how
many
hours
of
darkness
should
precede
moonrise
he
could
but
feebly
guess
grasping
his
strangely
fashioned
club
in
his
right
hand
and
the
strongest
and
sharpest
of
his
bone
daggers
in
the
left
he
stood
his
back
to
the
rock
wall
so
as
not
to
be
taken
in
the
rear
never
relaxing
for
a
moment
in
vigilance
his
ears
strained
to
their
utmost
tension
his
eyeballs
striving
to
pierce
the
black
gloom
more
than
once
a
sound
as
of
stealthy
ghostly
scrapings
caused
his
heart
to
beat
like
a
hammer
and
he
seemed
to
see
the
horrible
eyes
of
the
monster
flaming
luridly
out
of
the
darkness
but
still
the
silent
hours
went
by
unbroken
by
any
disturbance
ha
the
gloom
of
the
hollow
was
lightening
and
soon
the
rim
of
the
great
moon
peeped
over
the
cliff
behind
him
but
his
attention
was
rivetted
now
upon
something
before
him
a
something
huge
and
black
and
shadowy
which
moved
the
horror
was
coming
over
the
ridge
it
came
running
stealthily
a
few
yards
then
halting
then
running
again
it
passed
the
body
of
its
last
victim
and
came
running
on
laurence
stood
transfixed
spellbound
with
loathing
and
repulsion
as
he
gazed
upon
the
huge
hairy
legs
listening
to
the
scraping
patter
of
the
extremities
but
he
had
no
doubt
now
as
to
its
intentions
it
was
coming
straight
for
him
it
stopped
within
a
bare
forty
yards
and
now
as
for
the
first
time
he
got
a
clear
view
of
it
in
the
bright
moonlight
laurence
felt
his
heart
fail
him
for
the
very
hideousness
of
the
beast
it
had
the
head
of
a
devil
the
body
and
legs
of
a
spider
and
the
black
hairy
coat
of
a
bear
and
indeed
it
was
nearly
as
large
as
a
specimen
of
the
latter
no
it
was
no
ordinary
thing
this
fearsome
monster
it
advanced
a
little
nearer
stopped
again
then
rushed
straight
at
him
laurence
stepped
aside
just
in
time
to
avoid
the
open
jaws
but
too
late
entirely
to
escape
the
great
tentacle
which
swept
him
from
his
feet
right
under
the
horror
pinioning
for
a
moment
his
arms
then
by
a
tremendous
effort
he
threw
himself
partly
upwards
the
horrible
nippers
descended
but
missing
his
throat
descended
to
his
chest
and
met
there
with
a
metallic
crunching
sound
yet
he
was
unharmed
even
in
that
unspeakably
awful
moment
crushed
in
the
wreathings
of
the
huge
tentacles
the
frightful
head
and
devilish
eyes
of
the
vampire
within
two
feet
of
his
own
he
realized
what
had
happened
instead
of
penetrating
his
body
the
nippers
of
the
monster
had
struck
upon
the
metal
box
the
thought
nerved
him
wrenching
his
arm
partly
free
beneath
the
horror
he
sought
a
joint
in
the
horny
armour
and
drove
the
bone
dagger
into
its
body
drove
it
into
the
very
butt
throwing
up
its
head
convulsively
the
fearful
creature
began
to
spin
round
and
round
and
its
victim
realized
somewhat
of
its
enormous
muscular
strength
for
wiry
and
in
hard
training
as
he
was
he
was
dragged
with
it
rolled
over
and
over
in
the
wreathings
of
the
black
hairy
tentacles
was
he
being
dragged
off
to
its
den
the
very
terror
of
the
thought
nerved
him
once
more
revived
his
strength
drawing
forth
another
of
his
bone
daggers
he
plunged
it
too
deep
into
the
body
of
the
beast
for
a
moment
the
sinewy
struggling
tentacles
relaxed
and
just
that
moment
the
man
was
able
to
seize
or
he
had
been
lost
with
a
violent
effort
he
flung
himself
free
and
having
once
more
gained
his
feet
his
breath
coming
in
hard
panting
gasps
stood
awaiting
the
next
attack
thus
they
stood
a
strange
group
indeed
in
the
brilliant
moonlight
the
man
his
rudely
constructed
mace
uplifted
his
head
bent
forward
a
lurid
glow
in
his
eyes
the
glow
of
the
fell
fury
of
desperation
the
hideous
swaying
itself
on
its
horrible
tentacles
as
though
for
another
spring
upon
its
intended
victim
ha
it
was
coming
the
man
stood
ready
a
tightening
of
the
muscles
of
the
arm
that
held
the
club
a
lowering
of
the
brows
on
the
part
of
the
demon
a
spasmodic
contraction
again
it
came
at
him
half
rearing
itself
from
the
ground
its
feelers
waving
in
the
air
on
a
level
with
his
face
propelling
itself
slowly
forward
as
though
to
make
sure
of
its
final
rush
emitting
the
while
a
kind
of
soft
breathing
hiss
the
aspect
of
the
creature
was
so
truly
fearful
that
the
man
gazing
upon
it
was
conscious
of
a
kind
of
blasting
influence
stealing
over
him
beginning
to
paralyze
nerve
and
effort
alike
a
feeling
that
it
was
useless
to
continue
the
struggle
the
metal
box
could
not
save
him
twice
yet
through
all
was
the
certainty
that
to
lose
nerve
for
one
moment
was
to
lose
life
his
triumphed
he
knew
that
did
he
once
again
get
within
grip
of
those
ghastly
tentacles
he
would
never
emerge
alive
he
swung
up
his
improvised
mace
the
creature
was
now
within
twelve
yards
of
him
he
hurled
the
club
with
terrific
force
it
cleft
the
air
the
massive
band
of
gold
which
constituted
its
head
lighting
full
upon
one
of
the
eyes
for
one
moment
the
horror
contracted
into
a
heaving
writhing
heap
frightful
to
behold
then
throwing
out
its
grisly
tentacles
it
spun
round
and
round
as
it
had
done
before
the
man
heart
was
beating
as
though
it
would
burst
was
the
thing
slain
or
in
its
vampire
tenacity
of
life
would
it
renew
the
combat
ha
was
it
coming
again
was
it
one
moment
of
the
most
unutterable
suspense
and
then
and
then
the
fearful
thing
drew
back
turned
round
and
shoggled
away
in
the
direction
whence
it
had
come
it
was
worsted
save
for
a
few
scratches
laurence
was
unhurt
he
had
almost
miraculously
escaped
the
creature
nippers
yet
now
that
he
had
won
his
victory
a
sort
of
rage
took
possession
of
him
an
impulse
to
follow
it
up
to
destroy
this
fell
horror
utterly
growling
a
savage
curse
he
started
in
pursuit
of
the
retreating
monster
but
hardly
had
he
taken
two
steps
forward
than
there
floated
to
his
ear
a
sound
a
voice
which
seemed
to
fall
from
the
sky
itself
he
stopped
short
in
his
tracks
and
stood
immovable
statuesque
listening
chapter
xxviii
only
a
savage
nyonyoba
clear
distinct
the
name
sounded
floating
down
from
above
what
the
devil
is
that
was
the
characteristic
exclamation
that
burst
from
laurence
and
there
was
something
of
a
quaver
in
the
tone
for
his
nerves
were
quite
overstrung
and
no
manifestation
of
things
unknown
would
have
surprised
him
now
nyonyoba
ho
nyonyoba
again
called
the
voice
in
soft
rich
zulu
tones
low
but
penetrating
move
now
some
thirty
paces
to
where
the
cliff
juts
there
is
that
by
which
you
may
return
to
earth
again
and
the
spider
may
go
hungry
the
spider
has
got
enough
to
fill
him
up
for
some
long
time
answered
laurence
with
excusable
pride
but
who
speaks
the
voice
is
like
that
of
lindela
it
is
that
of
lindela
came
the
reply
climb
now
and
tarry
not
i
see
the
spider
climb
before
it
is
too
late
with
all
his
elation
now
that
the
first
flush
of
victory
was
over
laurence
could
not
recall
without
a
shiver
the
grasp
of
those
horrible
tentacles
the
glare
of
that
dreadful
face
he
vastly
preferred
flight
to
renewed
fight
now
following
the
voice
he
came
to
the
point
indicated
a
rope
of
twisted
thong
lay
against
the
rock
his
heart
leaped
within
him
soon
he
would
be
free
from
this
fearful
place
the
cliff
here
formed
a
projecting
angle
all
jagged
like
the
teeth
of
a
saw
he
remembered
noticing
this
remembered
balancing
its
capabilities
of
forming
a
natural
ladder
he
had
even
climbed
a
few
steps
and
then
had
been
forced
to
own
that
it
was
impracticable
now
however
with
the
aid
of
the
rope
the
thing
could
be
done
done
with
comparative
ease
as
a
preliminary
he
stepped
back
and
gazing
upwards
went
over
the
climb
in
his
mind
carefully
noting
every
step
every
handhold
the
cliff
was
terrace
here
and
the
nearest
whence
indeed
the
rope
hung
he
estimated
to
be
about
sixty
feet
without
this
aid
however
it
might
as
well
have
been
sixty
hundred
seizing
the
rope
he
began
his
ascent
the
mace
and
the
remainder
of
his
bone
daggers
still
slung
around
him
the
task
was
more
difficult
than
it
looked
contact
often
sudden
and
violent
with
the
rock
face
bruised
his
knuckles
inflicting
excruciating
pain
once
indeed
so
as
to
turn
him
sick
and
faint
but
a
glance
down
into
the
grisly
hollow
as
he
hung
thus
suspended
by
a
thread
the
glint
of
the
white
skeletons
in
the
moonlight
and
above
all
the
vague
shadowy
outline
black
and
frightful
of
the
horror
which
still
lingered
outside
its
den
as
though
meditating
return
nerved
him
once
more
what
if
he
were
to
fall
maimed
battered
helpless
would
not
the
frightful
thing
hold
him
entirely
at
its
mercy
and
return
and
drain
his
at
its
pleasure
summoning
all
his
all
his
strength
he
resumed
his
climb
and
soon
a
firm
resolute
hand
grasping
his
drew
him
up
for
the
time
being
into
safety
for
they
were
on
a
ledge
rest
now
beloved
said
the
chief
daughter
softly
as
she
turned
to
draw
up
the
rope
i
have
saved
thee
so
far
but
to
what
end
lindela
did
you
not
fling
a
stick
at
me
and
strike
me
hard
see
i
am
bruised
with
it
yet
it
has
even
hindered
my
climbing
powers
that
is
a
strange
way
of
showing
love
but
is
this
a
stranger
way
said
the
girl
sadly
displaying
the
rope
she
had
just
drawn
up
see
now
they
suspected
me
as
it
was
had
i
not
shown
myself
the
first
and
the
fiercest
to
turn
against
you
should
i
have
been
here
now
but
come
we
are
not
yet
in
safety
when
we
are
it
will
be
time
enough
for
talk
and
for
love
she
led
the
way
to
a
steep
narrow
cranny
up
this
they
climbed
some
fifty
feet
without
difficulty
emerging
upon
another
terrace
here
another
rope
hung
from
the
cliff
above
about
the
same
height
go
first
nyonyoba
while
i
hold
the
rope
to
steady
it
said
the
girl
then
too
if
your
strength
should
give
way
perhaps
i
may
catch
you
and
break
your
fall
i
am
as
strong
as
any
of
the
women
of
the
and
that
is
saying
much
for
answer
laurence
uttered
a
derisive
laugh
but
there
must
have
been
that
in
its
tone
which
pleased
the
chief
daughter
for
she
repeated
the
request
more
softly
more
entreatingly
see
now
lindela
he
answered
placing
a
hand
on
each
of
the
shapely
shoulders
which
glistened
light
bronze
in
the
moonlight
you
know
me
yet
if
you
think
i
will
leave
the
post
of
danger
to
you
obey
me
instantly
go
first
up
that
rope
or
i
return
and
do
combat
once
more
with
the
spider
once
more
have
you
then
actually
fought
with
that
with
that
which
is
down
there
and
her
eyes
were
round
with
amazement
i
have
and
the
thing
has
two
of
these
sticking
in
it
to
their
full
length
showing
the
bone
daggers
i
have
a
recollection
too
of
smiting
hard
with
this
noble
but
it
was
like
smiting
the
hardest
kind
of
tortoise
shell
not
yet
however
is
the
time
to
talk
go
first
lindela
go
first
she
obeyed
him
now
without
further
demur
and
soon
he
had
joined
her
for
this
climb
was
neither
so
long
nor
so
difficult
as
the
first
laurence
now
saw
that
they
were
high
up
on
a
mountain
top
great
peaks
some
towered
aloft
and
far
away
beneath
stretched
a
billowy
expanse
of
country
dim
misty
in
the
moonlight
the
air
was
keen
and
chill
and
with
something
of
a
shiver
lindela
resumed
her
light
upper
covering
which
she
had
laid
aside
in
order
to
give
full
freedom
to
body
and
limbs
and
you
have
met
and
fought
with
that
she
began
pointing
downwards
and
are
still
alive
why
nyonyoba
you
have
done
that
which
no
man
has
ever
done
before
how
did
you
do
it
with
the
bones
of
dead
men
ha
you
are
indeed
great
nyonyoba
great
indeed
yet
what
a
thought
a
good
thought
truly
still
had
it
occurred
to
those
who
went
before
me
they
might
have
done
the
same
yet
not
for
there
was
another
force
that
saved
me
which
they
lacked
ha
another
force
yes
the
sign
of
the
spider
the
spider
itself
was
powerless
against
that
he
drew
forth
the
metal
box
and
for
the
first
time
examined
it
by
the
light
of
the
moon
he
could
discern
two
slight
dents
one
upon
the
border
of
the
quaint
sprawling
initials
where
the
nippers
of
the
monster
had
struck
for
the
moment
he
forgot
lindela
forgot
the
surroundings
forgot
where
he
was
remembering
only
lilith
three
times
had
love
interposed
between
him
and
certain
death
three
times
most
unequivocally
and
this
third
time
from
what
unutterably
horrible
form
of
death
those
poisoned
fangs
the
very
thought
made
him
shudder
you
are
cold
beloved
see
here
are
coverings
i
have
thought
of
everything
the
voice
the
touch
upon
his
arm
recalled
him
to
himself
if
the
love
of
the
one
woman
had
stood
between
him
and
death
no
less
had
that
of
the
other
borne
its
part
and
this
other
now
stood
before
him
pleading
grand
in
her
statuesque
and
perfect
proportions
in
her
splendid
strength
and
courage
that
strength
and
courage
which
had
nerved
her
to
set
aside
the
most
awesome
traditions
of
her
race
to
brave
its
gloomy
superstitions
to
venture
alone
and
unaided
into
the
haunt
of
mysterious
terror
for
love
of
this
stranger
and
alien
this
too
was
the
sublimity
of
love
in
all
of
its
indomitable
quenchlessness
and
she
who
gave
so
freely
who
gave
all
indeed
of
this
rich
this
inestimable
gift
was
only
a
savage
only
a
savage
it
is
probable
that
some
of
the
most
divine
phases
of
mind
that
ever
had
dawned
upon
him
in
his
life
were
shed
over
laurence
stanninghame
then
as
he
stood
upon
that
lofty
mountain
top
at
midnight
in
the
flooding
light
of
the
moon
his
gaze
meeting
the
sweet
responsive
one
from
the
wide
opened
eyes
of
this
savage
say
nyonyoba
and
the
voice
was
full
and
rich
say
nyonyoba
what
will
you
give
me
if
i
show
you
that
which
will
delight
your
eyes
will
you
love
me
very
much
very
much
and
the
soft
musical
zulu
word
thus
repeated
was
as
a
caress
in
itself
well
then
come
she
led
the
way
a
few
yards
then
halted
a
bundle
lay
upon
the
ground
and
this
lindela
proceeded
to
undo
it
consisted
of
a
couple
of
strong
native
blankets
inclosing
several
round
baskets
of
woven
grass
similar
to
those
which
had
contained
the
food
which
had
been
let
down
in
cruel
mercy
into
the
place
of
the
horror
by
the
mysterious
hands
which
had
lowered
himself
but
that
upon
which
laurence
eyes
rested
upon
which
he
almost
pounced
was
a
short
carbine
and
a
it
was
a
vastly
inferior
weapon
to
his
own
trusty
express
but
still
it
was
a
firearm
that
is
not
all
cried
the
girl
laughing
gleefully
see
this
she
thrust
another
bundle
into
his
hands
almost
trembling
he
opened
it
a
revolver
his
own
also
another
of
smaller
calibre
and
with
both
was
a
quantity
of
ammunition
as
he
seized
these
he
realized
that
he
would
have
given
half
his
diamonds
up
till
then
forgotten
for
just
such
an
armoury
now
he
felt
equal
to
anything
to
anybody
he
was
once
more
the
dominant
animal
an
armed
man
nay
more
a
man
ha
now
you
are
once
more
as
you
ought
to
be
cried
lindela
gleefully
clapping
her
hands
together
you
who
are
stronger
than
that
which
is
down
there
falling
into
the
zulu
custom
of
refraining
directly
to
mention
that
which
is
held
in
awe
without
weapons
what
are
you
now
with
them
great
great
to
defeat
the
spider
armed
only
with
the
bones
of
men
that
was
great
indeed
magnificent
yet
i
think
i
will
silence
forever
that
horror
said
laurence
stepping
to
the
brink
of
the
cliff
and
peering
down
into
the
awful
hollow
yes
there
the
beast
is
i
will
risk
a
long
shot
and
he
sighted
the
carbine
but
in
a
moment
lindela
arms
were
around
him
pinioning
his
to
his
sides
not
so
beloved
she
whispered
earnestly
not
so
the
black
ones
who
wait
on
the
spider
frequently
come
to
look
down
into
his
haunt
even
when
they
do
not
bring
offerings
of
men
if
they
find
him
slain
they
will
know
you
have
escaped
and
will
pursue
for
which
reason
it
is
well
well
indeed
that
you
did
not
quite
slay
him
with
those
marvellous
weapons
the
bones
of
men
further
they
might
hear
the
sound
of
the
and
know
where
to
find
us
come
we
have
far
to
travel
this
was
unanswerable
laurence
stood
for
a
few
moments
gazing
down
into
the
fearsome
place
which
held
this
shuddering
mystery
was
it
real
was
he
dreaming
were
those
hours
of
terror
and
despair
spent
down
there
but
some
gigantic
nightmare
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
then
looked
again
the
thing
was
real
but
now
he
could
no
longer
see
the
horrid
shape
black
and
grisly
the
creature
must
have
withdrawn
into
its
ghastly
den
to
die
the
wounds
which
he
had
inflicted
upon
it
were
surely
too
deep
too
strongly
dealt
to
be
aught
but
mortal
the
spider
would
no
more
drink
the
blood
feed
on
the
flesh
of
men
then
he
turned
to
follow
lindela
the
latter
had
already
loaded
herself
with
the
bundle
of
wraps
and
provisions
to
his
suggestion
that
they
should
at
any
rate
halve
the
load
lindela
laughed
in
scorn
a
man
work
is
to
carry
his
weapons
and
when
needed
use
them
she
answered
to
bear
loads
and
this
is
a
light
one
indeed
is
work
not
work
for
one
who
has
proved
too
great
even
for
the
spider
then
as
they
travelled
down
the
mountain
side
in
the
fresh
cool
night
air
she
told
him
of
all
that
had
befallen
since
he
had
been
hauled
to
his
mysterious
and
awful
doom
the
thoughtless
act
of
holmes
had
necessitated
the
destruction
of
nondwana
kraal
there
and
then
and
indeed
the
king
brother
was
more
than
dissatisfied
with
the
clemency
extended
to
the
other
two
white
men
but
the
word
of
tyisandhlu
once
given
stood
they
had
been
sent
out
of
the
country
under
a
strong
armed
escort
which
was
under
orders
to
conduct
them
to
the
great
town
of
an
arab
chief
with
whom
el
khanac
had
blood
brotherhood
how
had
she
found
out
the
mystery
of
the
spider
was
it
known
to
all
the
nation
it
was
known
to
very
few
she
explained
the
black
ones
who
waited
upon
the
spider
were
a
mysterious
order
so
mysterious
indeed
that
none
knew
exactly
who
were
members
of
it
and
who
were
not
nor
could
she
tell
how
the
strange
and
gruesome
cult
first
originated
save
that
it
was
dimly
whispered
that
the
had
taken
it
over
from
the
nation
they
had
driven
out
and
that
in
accordance
with
an
ancient
prophecy
uttered
by
a
famous
magician
at
the
time
of
their
flight
from
zululand
but
as
she
told
of
her
resolve
to
rescue
him
at
all
risks
even
so
long
ago
as
when
by
overhearing
her
father
talk
she
learned
that
this
doom
was
to
be
his
in
any
case
laurence
felt
himself
grow
strangely
soft
towards
her
savage
or
not
nondwana
daughter
was
a
splendid
character
in
the
devotion
of
her
love
heroic
was
hardly
the
word
for
it
and
as
she
went
on
to
tell
how
she
had
devoted
herself
entirely
to
finding
out
the
locality
of
the
dreaded
spot
learning
the
way
to
it
by
stealthily
following
on
the
footsteps
of
that
grim
order
when
it
was
actually
engaged
in
conveying
thither
another
human
victim
risking
her
life
at
every
step
and
not
her
life
merely
but
incurring
the
certainty
of
the
same
fearful
doom
in
the
event
of
discovery
telling
it
too
in
the
most
simple
way
and
as
though
the
act
were
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
laurence
realized
that
he
might
have
done
worse
than
throw
in
his
lot
with
this
loftily
descended
daughter
of
a
splendid
race
of
kingly
barbarians
had
circumstances
been
ordered
otherwise
but
even
while
thus
listening
while
thus
thinking
another
vein
of
thought
was
running
parallel
in
his
mind
those
stones
which
he
had
picked
up
down
there
represented
wealth
ample
wealth
and
with
it
had
come
a
feverish
longing
to
enjoy
the
comforts
the
pleasures
the
delights
which
civilization
afforded
to
those
who
possessed
it
yet
his
entering
upon
such
enjoyment
if
it
were
ever
effected
as
at
that
moment
it
seemed
in
a
fair
way
to
be
he
owed
to
lindela
what
was
to
become
of
her
for
she
could
never
return
to
her
nation
she
had
thrown
away
everything
this
daughter
of
a
race
of
kings
had
risked
her
life
daily
to
save
the
life
of
a
stranger
and
that
for
love
yes
that
was
love
indeed
he
thought
she
was
a
savage
but
she
was
a
splendid
woman
with
mind
and
character
as
noble
as
her
own
magnificent
physique
she
would
be
a
delightful
a
perfect
companion
during
those
wild
free
forest
marches
day
after
day
night
after
night
fraught
with
peril
and
hardship
at
every
step
but
how
would
civilization
affect
her
would
it
not
ruin
that
grand
character
even
as
it
had
ruined
really
noble
natures
before
her
for
there
is
such
a
thing
as
the
noble
savage
although
we
grant
the
product
to
be
a
scarce
one
and
with
all
this
was
entwined
the
thought
of
lilith
ormskirk
well
sufficient
for
the
day
is
the
evil
thereof
had
always
been
his
guiding
maxim
and
for
the
present
as
he
took
his
way
down
the
mountain
side
the
great
crags
rising
higher
and
higher
to
the
moon
the
black
billowy
roll
of
the
forest
country
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
the
voices
of
the
wild
creatures
of
the
waste
raised
weird
and
ravening
on
the
night
the
thunderous
boom
of
the
voice
of
the
forest
king
ever
and
anon
dominating
all
others
laurence
felt
conscious
of
a
wild
exhilarating
sense
of
freedom
there
was
music
in
these
sounds
after
the
ghastly
awed
silence
of
the
horrible
place
from
which
he
had
been
delivered
and
was
it
due
on
his
part
to
the
frame
of
mind
of
the
hardened
adventurer
trained
to
take
things
as
they
come
the
good
with
the
ill
but
never
during
the
days
and
weeks
that
followed
did
the
daughter
of
the
line
of
the
kings
feel
moved
to
any
qualm
of
regret
over
the
sacrifice
of
name
and
home
and
country
which
she
had
made
for
this
man
sake
chapter
xxix
a
deep
a
solitary
grave
they
were
now
on
the
other
slope
of
the
great
mountain
chain
which
shut
in
the
country
on
that
side
and
judging
by
the
landmarks
it
seemed
to
laurence
that
the
surroundings
wore
an
aspect
not
absolutely
unfamiliar
and
that
they
could
not
be
far
out
of
the
way
by
which
he
had
been
brought
in
a
captive
there
was
the
same
broad
belt
of
desolate
land
which
took
many
days
to
traverse
a
land
of
gloomy
forest
and
sluggish
river
and
night
after
night
they
would
build
their
resting
secure
in
the
red
circle
of
its
cheery
flame
while
the
howling
of
ravening
beasts
kept
up
dismal
chorus
in
the
outer
darkness
beyond
it
was
a
primeval
idyll
the
wandering
of
these
two
the
man
the
product
of
the
highest
civilization
the
woman
the
daughter
of
a
savage
race
yet
in
such
wandering
savage
and
civilized
were
curiously
near
akin
they
were
free
as
air
untrammelled
by
any
conventionality
or
artificial
needs
the
land
furnished
ample
subsistence
animal
and
vegetable
the
wild
game
which
supplied
them
with
food
could
not
have
been
more
free
would
you
rather
have
been
rescued
some
other
way
nyonyoba
said
the
girl
one
evening
as
they
were
sitting
by
the
no
there
is
no
other
way
i
should
have
preferred
see
now
lindela
what
if
we
were
to
return
to
your
people
surely
they
would
believe
now
in
the
sign
of
the
spider
and
that
the
conqueror
is
greater
than
the
conquered
not
so
she
answered
and
her
eyes
which
had
brightened
at
the
first
words
of
his
reply
became
clouded
and
sad
they
would
put
us
to
death
now
both
of
us
but
were
it
otherwise
would
you
really
desire
to
return
one
might
do
worse
i
do
know
that
the
blessings
of
civilization
are
such
blessings
after
all
which
to
you
is
a
riddle
he
relapsed
into
silence
and
thought
there
were
times
when
with
the
riches
upon
him
he
was
consumed
with
a
perfectly
feverish
longing
to
return
to
civilization
there
were
other
times
again
when
he
looked
back
with
more
than
a
lingering
regret
to
the
pleasant
land
of
the
furthermore
lindela
had
entwined
herself
around
his
heart
more
than
he
knew
not
an
atom
of
the
intrepidity
of
devotion
she
had
displayed
in
order
to
compass
his
final
rescue
was
thrown
away
upon
him
any
more
than
her
deportment
since
through
the
toilsomeness
and
peril
of
their
journeying
no
word
of
complaint
or
despondency
escaped
her
she
was
always
cheerful
resourceful
in
short
a
delightful
companion
yet
she
was
a
savage
he
thought
with
a
curl
of
the
lip
as
before
his
mind
eye
arose
the
contrast
between
her
and
her
civilized
sisters
with
their
artificiality
and
moods
and
caprices
and
petty
spites
and
fictitious
ailments
and
general
contentiousness
all
around
it
was
by
no
means
certain
he
would
not
have
returned
to
dwell
with
her
among
her
own
people
had
that
course
been
open
but
it
was
not
only
the
return
to
civilization
lay
before
him
and
what
to
do
with
lindela
for
he
had
not
the
slightest
desire
to
part
with
her
meanwhile
they
had
reached
the
perilous
phase
of
their
wanderings
ruins
of
multitudinous
villages
lay
in
their
path
at
every
turn
but
what
was
worse
signs
of
human
occupation
began
to
show
once
more
and
human
occupation
meant
hostile
occupation
it
was
fortunate
that
the
land
had
been
doubly
raided
by
the
and
the
because
in
its
depopulation
lay
their
safety
but
those
who
had
escaped
would
not
be
likely
to
view
with
any
friendly
glance
a
representative
of
each
despoiling
factor
as
exemplified
in
these
two
so
they
avoided
villages
which
was
easy
enough
by
careful
observation
ahead
what
was
less
easy
however
was
to
avoid
wandering
parties
nor
was
it
always
practicable
once
they
came
right
into
such
a
horde
near
enough
that
is
for
their
presence
to
be
discovered
and
for
a
whole
day
were
they
stealthily
followed
their
pursuers
only
drawing
off
owing
to
nightfall
and
the
proximity
of
other
tribes
hostile
to
themselves
another
time
they
nearly
walked
into
the
midst
of
an
encampment
while
a
cannibal
feast
was
in
progress
at
sight
of
the
human
limbs
hung
up
the
filed
teeth
and
tattooed
faces
of
these
savages
tearing
at
their
horrible
repast
lindela
shuddered
with
repulsion
and
anger
see
there
nyonyoba
she
said
when
they
had
withdrawn
beyond
hearing
do
not
the
act
rightly
in
stamping
out
these
foul
who
devour
the
flesh
of
their
own
kindred
like
wild
dogs
i
think
so
and
we
who
capture
them
to
sell
them
do
we
not
send
them
to
a
better
fate
where
they
can
no
more
indulge
in
such
repellent
appetites
and
this
she
did
not
attempt
to
gainsay
for
months
they
journeyed
on
thus
peril
their
companion
at
every
step
the
more
so
as
they
gained
the
more
inhabited
tracts
once
they
fell
in
with
a
petty
arab
chief
and
his
following
this
man
was
known
to
laurence
and
treated
them
well
and
hospitably
while
they
remained
at
his
camp
but
before
they
departed
he
said
what
sum
will
purchase
this
girl
my
friend
for
by
now
thou
must
have
had
enough
of
her
she
would
fetch
large
money
at
khartoum
whither
i
can
forward
her
and
i
will
deal
with
thee
fairly
yes
allah
is
great
i
will
only
make
my
profit
on
her
the
price
shall
be
liberal
then
laurence
stanninghame
the
renegade
the
man
who
had
thrown
all
considerations
of
duty
and
feeling
to
the
winds
as
so
much
lumber
so
much
meaningless
conventionality
felt
as
shocked
and
disgusted
as
ever
he
could
have
done
in
his
most
foolish
days
what
time
illusions
were
as
vivid
as
golden
as
ever
but
remembering
himself
he
replied
in
an
even
tone
no
sum
will
purchase
her
rahman
ben
zuhdi
were
i
dying
at
this
moment
and
large
wealth
could
bring
me
fifty
years
more
of
life
i
would
not
sell
her
all
that
the
world
contains
could
not
purchase
her
for
she
has
restored
me
to
life
at
the
peril
of
her
own
again
and
again
nay
more
has
restored
me
to
that
which
alone
renders
life
a
possession
of
any
value
i
have
dealt
in
slaves
but
this
is
a
daughter
of
a
race
of
kings
the
people
of
the
spider
said
the
arab
thoughtfully
flashing
a
curious
glance
at
lindela
who
stood
some
little
way
apart
they
grow
their
women
fine
if
they
are
all
as
this
one
well
i
did
but
make
thee
the
offer
my
brother
but
if
a
man
values
anything
above
gold
all
the
gold
in
the
world
will
not
induce
him
to
part
therewith
fare
thee
well
we
part
friends
as
friends
indeed
do
we
part
o
rahman
replied
laurence
and
they
resumed
their
respective
ways
as
time
went
on
lindela
manner
seemed
to
undergo
a
change
her
spirits
to
flag
was
it
the
fearful
malarial
heat
of
the
forest
country
often
swampy
which
was
affecting
her
thought
laurence
with
concern
he
himself
was
inured
to
it
but
this
daughter
of
a
healthy
upland
race
accustomed
to
the
breezy
equable
climate
of
her
mountain
home
on
her
the
steaming
heat
of
the
rotting
vegetation
and
marshy
soil
might
conceivably
be
beginning
to
tell
they
were
resting
one
day
during
the
noontide
heat
no
burning
rays
from
the
outside
sun
could
scorch
here
for
the
place
was
dim
with
thick
foliage
and
creepers
trailing
from
the
limbs
of
great
forest
trees
both
had
fallen
asleep
suddenly
lindela
started
up
a
sharp
wringing
pain
seeming
to
begin
on
the
left
shoulder
went
through
her
frame
it
spread
down
her
arm
then
through
to
the
other
shoulder
down
the
other
arm
what
was
it
a
cramp
caught
from
the
treacherous
chill
of
the
humid
soil
perhaps
well
it
would
soon
pass
then
laurence
began
to
stir
in
his
sleep
the
sight
made
her
forget
her
pain
he
must
not
awaken
he
needed
rest
noiselessly
plucking
a
leafy
branch
she
went
over
to
him
and
began
softly
to
fan
him
this
was
effective
his
even
regular
breathing
told
that
he
slumbered
peacefully
restfully
once
more
soon
she
became
aware
that
her
powers
were
failing
her
her
arm
seemed
to
become
cramped
paralyzed
and
a
mist
floated
before
her
eyes
what
did
it
mean
her
lips
opened
to
call
aloud
then
closed
uttering
no
sound
why
should
he
be
disturbed
because
she
was
suffering
a
little
pain
thought
this
savage
this
daughter
of
a
race
of
savage
kings
but
the
mist
deepened
before
her
failing
vision
she
swayed
where
she
sat
then
fell
heavily
forward
upon
him
the
branch
wherewith
she
had
been
fanning
him
striking
him
sharply
across
the
face
laurence
sprang
to
his
feet
unconsciously
throwing
her
from
him
his
first
impression
was
that
he
had
been
surprised
in
his
sleep
by
an
enemy
lindela
what
is
it
he
cried
raising
her
up
and
supporting
her
and
then
his
dark
face
turned
a
livid
ashen
white
for
with
the
dull
stupor
which
lay
heavy
in
the
usually
bright
eyes
his
own
had
rested
upon
something
else
the
shapely
shoulder
was
swollen
to
an
abnormal
size
and
at
the
back
of
it
were
two
small
round
punctures
she
has
been
bitten
a
snake
of
course
he
muttered
and
it
is
too
late
yes
it
is
too
late
nyonyoba
she
murmured
yet
i
do
not
think
i
have
been
bitten
not
by
a
snake
or
i
should
have
known
it
but
you
have
been
when
was
this
why
did
you
not
awaken
me
and
his
voice
startled
even
himself
so
fierce
was
it
in
its
grief
why
should
i
awaken
you
beloved
you
who
needed
rest
she
murmured
groping
for
his
hand
yes
it
is
too
late
it
was
some
time
ago
i
thought
it
was
a
cramp
but
i
must
have
been
bitten
laurence
was
thinking
and
thinking
hard
what
remedy
was
there
none
it
was
even
as
she
had
said
too
late
the
poison
had
penetrated
her
whole
system
i
am
dying
beloved
and
shall
soon
go
into
the
dark
unknown
she
murmured
more
drowsily
than
before
yet
it
matters
nothing
for
those
of
our
nation
do
not
fear
death
and
listen
i
heard
the
arab
proposal
to
you
and
your
answer
thereto
yet
when
you
returned
to
your
people
what
would
have
become
of
me
illustration
i
am
dying
beloved
and
shall
soon
go
into
the
dark
unknown
she
was
but
voicing
his
own
thoughts
of
many
and
many
a
time
before
yet
now
laurence
felt
almost
startled
was
it
the
clear
intuition
which
rightly
or
wrongly
is
believed
to
accompany
the
hour
of
dissolution
then
he
remembered
she
could
have
learned
much
about
civilized
peoples
through
the
talk
of
tyisandhlu
and
her
father
i
die
beloved
but
i
welcome
death
she
went
on
for
i
have
lived
ah
yes
i
have
lived
i
feel
no
pain
now
and
i
die
in
your
arms
surely
my
will
not
weep
mournfully
on
the
voices
of
the
night
as
others
do
surely
it
will
laugh
for
very
joy
for
very
love
because
of
this
my
end
until
time
shall
die
will
it
not
nyonyoba
my
beloved
say
will
it
not
but
laurence
could
not
say
anything
for
lo
a
marvel
this
man
deadened
for
long
years
to
feeling
or
ruth
this
coldly
pitiless
trafficker
in
the
sufferings
of
human
beings
in
whose
cynical
creed
now
such
a
love
as
that
of
this
savage
girl
held
no
place
felt
now
as
though
a
hand
were
gripping
him
by
the
throat
choking
all
power
of
reply
and
the
call
of
birds
high
among
the
alone
broke
the
silence
in
the
of
the
forest
aisles
lindela
voice
had
sunk
until
it
was
inaudible
and
laurence
was
constrained
to
bend
his
head
to
hers
in
order
to
catch
her
every
word
then
a
flash
of
gladness
seemed
momentarily
to
light
up
the
drowsy
eyes
and
she
spoke
no
more
her
eyelids
closed
her
breathing
grew
fainter
and
fainter
and
soon
laurence
knew
that
that
which
lay
heavy
within
his
arms
was
no
longer
a
living
woman
lindela
had
passed
for
long
he
sat
thus
then
a
faint
rustling
sound
in
the
dry
wood
of
an
immense
fallen
caught
his
ear
ha
the
snake
which
had
been
the
cause
of
her
death
it
at
any
rate
should
die
gently
he
laid
her
down
then
snatching
up
a
stick
which
had
been
used
to
carry
one
of
the
loads
he
advanced
towards
the
sound
something
was
struggling
among
the
dry
bark
with
the
stick
he
broke
this
away
there
fell
out
an
enormous
spider
he
started
back
in
horror
and
loathing
the
hairy
monster
brought
back
too
gruesome
a
reminiscence
then
he
noticed
that
it
looked
as
if
it
had
received
injury
through
crushing
two
or
three
of
the
hideous
tentacles
being
partially
or
wholly
broken
off
then
as
he
gazed
with
loathing
upon
the
sprawling
thing
it
seemed
that
the
missing
link
was
supplied
lindela
in
her
sleep
must
have
moved
over
on
to
this
horror
though
not
heavily
enough
to
crush
it
it
had
buried
its
venomous
nippers
in
her
shoulder
prior
to
crawling
away
to
die
a
shiver
ran
through
his
frame
as
he
beat
to
death
the
great
noisome
insect
and
his
blood
seemed
to
chill
with
a
superstitious
fear
it
seemed
too
strange
too
marvellous
to
be
a
mere
coincidence
lindela
had
defied
the
traditions
of
her
race
and
now
she
had
met
her
death
through
the

a
daughter
of
the
kings
of
the
people
of

had
met
her
death
through
the
spider
bite
it
was
horrifying
in
its
sinister
appropriateness
was
it
really
a
thing
of
witchcraft
did
the

have
actual

here
in

this
demoniacal

followed

its

at

a
distance
from
the

and
country
to
which
she
would
return
no
more
when
laurence
stanninghame
resumed
his
journey
the
next
day
he
left
behind
him
a
grave
a
deep
secure
grave
a
solitary
grave
in
the
heart
of
the
untrodden
forest
his
journeyings
henceforth
must
be
alone
but
ofttimes
his
thoughts
would
go
back
to
that
nameless
grave
and
to
her
who
rested
forever
therein
only
a
savage
only
a
heathen
yes
but
if
brave
devoted
love
is
of
any
account
at
all
in
the
scheme
of
christian
virtues
where
would
this
savage
this
heathen
come
in
at
the
day
of
awards
where
indeed
among
the
multitude
of
pharisees
truth
to
tell
laurence
believed
but
dimly
in
the
day
of
awards
yet
did
it
exist

my
ideal
johannesburg
once
more
the
great
restless
had
passed
through
many
changes
many
booms
and
rumours
of
booms
the
latter
for
the
most
part
since
that
quiet
now
four
years
ago
many
of
those
who
then
were
among
its
busiest
inhabitants
had
departed
some
to
a
land
whence
there
is
no
return
others
to
the
land
of
their
respective
births
many
who
then
had
been
on
the
verge
of
millionaires
buzzing
their
rapidly
acquired
gains
with
a
lavish
magnificence
which
they
imagined
to
be
princely
were
now
uncertificated
bankrupts
or
had
blown
their
brains
out
or
had
come
within
the
meshes
of
the
law
and
the
walls
of
a
convict
prison
while
others
who
at
that
time
lived
upon
hope
and
the
whiff
of
an
oiled
rag
now
fared
sumptuously
every
day
and
would
do
so
unto
their
lives
end
but
for
those
who
had
held
on
to
the
place
through
good
and
evil
report
since
the
time
we
last
pioneered
our
reader
through
its
streets
and
arid
surroundings
something
of
a
surprise
was
in
store
for
the
old
order
of
things
was
reversed
instead
of
hazon
returning
without
his
travelling
companions
the
latter
had
returned
without
hazon
bless
my
soul
stanninghame
is
that
you
cried
rankin
running
right
into
laurence
one
morning
just
outside
the
new
exchange
and
holmes
too
why
you
looking
uncommonly
well
both
of
you
what
have
you
done
with
the
pirate
eh
oh
he
coming
on
replied
laurence
which
in
substance
was
correct
though
it
might
be
weeks
before
he
came
on
for
as
a
matter
of
fact
hazon
had
remained
behind
at
a
certain
point
to
collect
and
reduce
to
cash
such
gains
as
were
being
custodied
for
him
and
the
joint
undertaking
by
sundry
of
his
the
arab
chiefs
coming
on
is
he
well
well
i
think
we
been
libelling
the
pirate
after
all
eh
rainsford
as
that
worthy
just
joined
them
hazon
come
back
without
hazon
instead
of
the
other
way
about
laurence
thought
how
nearly
it
had
been
a
case
of
the
other
way
about
had
he
not
offered
himself
instead
of
holmes
it
would
have
been
for
he
would
have
remained
with
the
and
hazon
would
have
returned
alone
of
the
fate
of
holmes
well
he
knew
what
that
would
have
been
holmes
however
did
not
for
the
simple
reason
that
laurence
had
refrained
from
communicating
a
word
relating
to
that
horrible
episode
to
either
of
his
associates
when
shortly
after
parting
with
rahman
ben
zuhdi
and
the
death
of
lindela
he
had
found
the
two
safe
and
well
at
the
principal
town
of
a
prominent
arab
chief
and
holmes
possibly
through
ignorance
of
its
nature
or
magnitude
never
did
fully
appreciate
the
sacrifice
which
the
other
had
made
for
him
what
do
you
think
went
on
rankin
when
the
requisite
amount
of
greeting
and
chaff
had
been
exchanged
this
fellow
rainsford
has
gone
and
got
married
has
started
out
in
the
nursery
department
for
all
worth
laurence
laughed
why
rainsford
you
were
as
stony
broke
as
the
rest
of
us
when
i
left
things
looking
up
eh
of
course
i
told
you
it
was
a
case
of
up
told
you
at
the
time
and
it
my
belief
you
have
done
better
to
have
remained
here
then
lowering
his
voice
where
the
pirate
coming
on
rainsford
whistled
and
looked
knowing
what
do
you
say
cut
in
rankin
a
drop
of
gin
and
soda
would
hurt
us
eh
then
while
they
moved
round
to
the
exchange
bar
he
went
on
i
got
a
thing
that
would
suit
you
to
a
hair
stanninghame
i
take
it
up
myself
if
i
could
but
i
only
an
agent
in
the
matter
shares
eh
yes
skinner
and
sacks
dead
off
see
here
rankin
you
must
them
on
somebody
else
if
i
were
next
door
to
certain
of
making
half
a
million
out
of
it
even
then
i
would
touch
any
sort
of
investment
connected
with
this
place
no
not
to
save
my
immortal
soul
if
i
got
one
which
at
times
seems
doubtful
and
there
was
something
in
laurence
laugh
evoked
by
old
time
recollections
which
convinced
the
other
that
no
business
was
to
be
done
in
this
quarter
at
any
rate
there
was
method
in
the
way
in
which
laurence
had
sought
to
dawdle
away
the
morning
he
had
arrived
late
the
night
before
and
as
yet
had
made
no
inquiries
how
strange
it
all
seemed
surely
it
was
but
yesterday
that
he
was
here
last
surely
he
had
slept
and
had
dreamed
the
portentous
events
which
had
intervened
they
could
not
have
been
real
but
the
stones
the
great
diamonds
they
were
real
enough
the
metal
box
too
the
sign
of
the
spider
how
was
he
thus
transformed
later
in
the
day
as
he
stood
on
the
knocking
at
the
door
of
falkner
house
he
was
conscious
that
his
heart
hardly
beat
quicker
that
his
pulses
were
as
firm
and
even
as
ever
four
years
of
a
hard
stern
schooling
had
done
it
yes
falkner
was
at
home
he
was
ushered
into
the
drawing
room
which
was
empty
there
was
the
same
scent
of
roses
the
same
the
same
lounge
on
which
they
had
sat
together
that
night
even
the
battery
stamps
across
the
kloof
seemed
to
hammer
out
the
same
refrain
the
door
opened
was
it
lilith
herself
no
only
lilith
aunt
why
stanninghame
i
am
glad
to
see
you
but
how
you
have
changed
well
yes
falkner
time
has
knocked
me
about
some
i
ca
say
the
same
as
regards
yourself
though
you
have
changed
an
atom
she
laughed
that
ca
be
true
i
sure
i
feel
more
and
more
of
an
old
woman
every
day
but
sit
down
do
and
tell
me
about
your
adventures
have
you
had
a
successful
trip
pretty
well
it
has
proved
a
more
paying
concern
at
any
rate
than
the
exhilarating
occupation
known
as
for
the
boom
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
that
and
your
friends
have
you
all
returned
safe
and
sound
laurence
replied
that
they
had
but
for
all
his
outward
equability
his
impatience
was
amounting
to
torment
even
while
he
talked
his
ears
were
strained
to
catch
the
sound
of
a
light
step
without
how
would
lilith
look
he
wondered
would
these
four
years
have
left
their
mark
upon
her
and
how
is
your
niece
miss
ormskirk
he
went
on
lilith
oh
but
by
the
way
she
is
not
ormskirk
now
she
is
married
oh
is
she
i
had
heard
after
all
one
forgets
how
time
slips
by
that
was
all
it
was
a
shock
possibly
a
hard
one
but
of
late
laurence
stanninghame
had
been
undergoing
a
steady
training
for
meeting
such
falkner
who
had
made
the
communication
not
without
some
qualm
for
she
had
been
put
very
much
up
to
the
former
state
of
things
both
by
her
nephew
george
and
certain
signs
of
the
times
not
altogether
to
be
dissimulated
however
bravely
lilith
had
borne
herself
after
that
parting
now
so
far
back
felt
relieved
and
in
a
measure
a
trifle
disappointed
for
womanlike
she
dearly
loved
romance
but
the
man
before
her
had
not
turned
a
hair
had
not
even
changed
colour
at
the
intelligence
it
could
not
really
matter
she
decided
which
was
as
well
for
him
but
for
herself
disappointing
yes
she
married
her
cousin
george
my
nephew
you
remember
him
she
went
on
i
was
against
it
for
a
long
time
but
after
all
i
believe
it
was
the
saving
of
him
poor
fellow
he
was
so
wildly
in
love
with
her
he
was
simply
going
to
the
dogs
yes
it
was
the
saving
of
him
that
satisfactory
anyway
said
laurence
as
though
he
were
discussing
the
fortunes
of
any
two
people
whose
names
he
had
just
heard
for
the
first
time
but
meanwhile
his
mind
was
inwardly
avenging
itself
upon
its
outward
for
vividly
and
as
though
spoken
into
his
ears
there
seemed
to
float
fragments
of
those
farewell
words
uttered
there
in
that
room
have
drawn
my
very
heart
and
soul
into
yours
oh
it
is
too
bitter
laurence
my
darling
my
love
my
life
my
ideal
and
well
the
foolish
dream
had
been
a
pleasant
one
while
it
lasted
nay
more
in
all
seriousness
it
had
borne
momentous
fruit
for
no
less
than
three
times
had
that
episode
yes
now
it
seemed
a
mere
episode
intervened
between
him
and
death
lilith
will
be
so
glad
to
see
you
when
you
are
passing
through
for
of
course
you
will
be
returning
home
again
they
have
taken
a
bungalow
at
kalk
bay
for
the
summer
i
find
you
the
address
they
talked
on
a
little
longer
and
then
laurence
took
his
departure
as
he
gained
the
outer
air
once
more
there
was
that
about
the
shimmer
of
the
sunlight
the
hum
of
the
battery
stamp
the
familiarity
of
the
surroundings
which
reminded
him
of
that
former
time
when
he
had
thus
stepped
forth
having
bidden
a
which
was
not
a
yet
the
same
pain
did
not
grip
around
his
heart
now
not
in
its
former
acuteness
rather
was
it
now
a
sense
of
the
falling
away
of
all
things
by
a
freak
of
psychology
his
mind
reverted
to
poor
lindela
dying
in
his
arms
in
the
steamy
gloom
of
the
equatorial
forest
dying
slowly
by
inches
in
pain
yet
uttering
no
cry
no
complaint
lest
she
should
rob
him
of
a
few
minutes
more
or
less
of
sleep
that
was
indeed
love
still
even
while
making
it
his
sense
of
philosophy
told
him
the
comparison
was
not
a
fair
one
well
that
was
over
another
chapter
in
his
life
to
shut
down
now
to
make
the
best
of
life
now
with
the
means
to
taste
its
pleasures
with
hard
firm
health
to
enjoy
them
after
all
what
was
a
mere
sentimental
grievance
perhaps
it
counted
for
something
for
all
he
told
himself
to
the
contrary
perhaps
deep
down
there
gnawed
a
restless
craving
stifle
it
as
he
would
who
can
tell
the
leaves
for
england
at
such
was
the
notice
which
posted
up
in
shipping
office
or
in
the
short
paragraph
column
of
the
cape
town
newspapers
met
the
public
eye
it
was
the
middle
of
the
morning
laurence
stanninghame
striving
to
kill
the
few
hours
remaining
to
him
on
african
soil
was
strolling
listlessly
along
adderley
street
a
shop
window
adorned
with
photographic
views
of
local
scenery
and
types
of
natives
mostly
rigged
up
with
shield
and
assegai
to
look
warlike
for
the
occasion
attracted
his
attention
and
for
a
while
he
stood
idly
gazing
at
these
his
survey
ended
he
backed
away
from
the
window
in
a
perfectly
irrational
and
british
manner
on
a
busy
thoroughfare
and
trod
hard
on
somebody
toes
a
little
cry
of
mingled
pain
and
resentment
then
he
stood
profusely
apologizing
but
with
the
first
tones
of
his
voice
she
whom
he
had
so
awkwardly
if
unintentionally
damaged
seemed
to
lose
sight
of
her
injuries
her
face
blanched
but
not
with
physical
pain
her
lips
parted
in
a
sort
of
gasp
and
the
sweet
eyes
wide
and
dilated
sought
his
in
wonder
almost
in
fear
laurence
the
name
was
hardly
audible
but
he
heard
it
and
if
his
steely
philosophy
had
stood
him
in
good
stead
before
assuredly
at
this
moment
his
guard
was
down
as
he
recognized
that
he
had
last
beheld
this
serene
vision
of
loveliness
arrayed
as
now
in
cool
white
strained
to
him
in
farewell
embrace
alone
in
the
solemn
night
those
parted
lips
pressed
to
his
in
pain
those
sweet
eyes
starry
humid
with
love
gazing
full
into
his
own
and
now
they
met
again
four
years
later
by
chance
in
a
busy
thoroughfare
pray
excuse
my
inexcusable
awkwardness
i
must
have
hurt
you
he
said
as
they
clasped
hands
and
the
tone
was
even
almost
formal
for
he
remembered
they
were
in
public
you
you
have
changed
i
should
hardly
have
known
you
but
for
your
voice
she
said
unsteadily
for
he
had
turned
to
walk
up
the
street
with
her
but
when
did
you
return
i
had
not
heard
had
you
not
i
called
on
your
aunt
in
johannesburg
on
the
way
through
she
was
telling
me
all
about
you
something
of
relief
seemed
to
manifest
itself
in
lilith
tone
as
she
rejoined
but
you
are
you
staying
here
well
no
i
have
been
trying
to
kill
time
until
this
afternoon
i
am
leaving
by
the
oh
by
the
she
repeated
again
and
in
the
catch
in
her
voice
and
the
quickness
of
utterance
he
knew
she
was
talking
at
random
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
in
fact
do
you
care
to
hear
a
little
of
what
has
befallen
me
since
i
went
he
said
then
let
us
turn
in
here
as
she
made
a
mute
but
eager
gesture
of
assent
they
had
gained
the
entrance
to
the
oak
avenue
at
the
back
of
government
house
strolling
up
this
they
turned
into
the
beautiful
botanical
gardens
nobody
was
about
save
a
gardener
or
two
busied
with
their
work
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
is
so
marvellous
that
you
will
probably
refuse
to
believe
it
he
said
after
narrating
the
incident
of
the
sign
upon
the
metal
box
which
had
arrested
the
uplifted
weapons
of
the
unsparing
and
of
course
editing
out
all
that
might
have
revealed
the
real
nature
of
the
expedition
i
have
never
breathed
one
word
of
it
to
any
living
being
not
even
to
those
who
were
with
me
i
would
rather
you
did
not
either
lilith
because
it
is
too
strange
for
anybody
to
believe
and
for
other
reasons
she
gave
the
required
promise
and
he
drew
forth
the
box
at
sight
of
this
relic
of
the
past
that
sweet
entrancing
if
profitless
past
lilith
could
no
longer
quite
keep
herself
in
hand
the
tears
welled
forth
falling
upon
the
metal
box
itself
hallowing
as
it
were
the
sweet
charm
of
its
saving
power
your
love
had
power
to
save
one
life
you
see
he
went
on
in
a
cold
even
voice
intended
to
strengthen
him
against
himself
but
look
now
see
those
marks
on
the
lid
just
discernible
now
listen
and
lilith
did
listen
and
at
the
description
of
the
awful
rock
prison
with
its
skeleton
bones
the
long
hours
of
helpless
suspense
and
despair
and
the
final
struggle
in
the
ghastly
moonlight
the
struggle
for
life
with
the
appalling
monster
that
tenanted
it
her
eyes
dilated
with
horror
and
with
pallid
face
and
gasping
lips
she
begged
him
not
to
go
on
so
great
a
hold
did
the
incident
take
upon
her
imagination
even
there
in
the
blaze
of
the
broad
midday
sunlight
i
have
done
now
he
said
well
lilith
you
see
what
that
token
of
your
love
has
rescued
me
from
it
was
given
as
an
amulet
or
charm
and
right
well
has
it
fulfilled
its
purpose
but
to
what
end
did
you
did
you
come
back
with
what
you
went
for
she
broke
forth
at
last
as
with
an
effort
yes
therein
too
you
proved
yourself
a
true
prophet
and
now
tell
me
something
about
yourself
were
you
angry
with
me
when
you
heard
what
i
had
done
laurence
she
said
raising
her
eyes
full
to
his
angry
no
why
should
i
be
your
life
is
your
own
though
as
a
rule
sacrificing
ones
self
to
save
somebody
else
as
your
aunt
rather
gave
me
to
understand
was
the
case
here
is
lamentably
apt
to
turn
out
a
case
of
throwing
away
one
life
with
both
hands
it
is
too
much
like
cutting
one
own
throat
to
save
somebody
else
from
being
hanged
and
is
that
your
way
of
wishing
me
well
laurence
she
said
reproachfully
no
i
wish
you
nothing
but
well
it
would
be
futile
to
say
i
suppose
the
happiness
of
doing
one
duty
is
a
hard
kind
of
happiness
after
all
she
said
with
a
sad
little
smile
yes
an
excellent
copybook
maxim
but
for
all
purposes
of
real
life
bosh
am
i
not
in
my
own
person
a
living
instance
to
that
effect
as
soon
as
i
pitched
to
the
dogs
why
then
and
only
then
did
i
begin
to
travel
in
the
contrary
direction
to
those
sagacious
animals
myself
which
of
course
is
simply
appalling
morality
but
it
life
well
child
make
the
best
of
your
life
and
prove
a
shining
exception
to
the
dismal
rule
do
you
remember
our
talk
on
board
the
dear
old
yes
we
had
so
many
you
were
going
to
say
but
i
mean
our
first
one
the
first
serious
one
that
night
leaning
over
the
side
i
asked
you
i
make
a
success
of
life
do
you
remember
your
answer
as
well
as
though
it
were
yesterday
i
replied
that
the
chances
were
pretty
even
inclining
if
anything
to
the
negative
well
and
was
i
right
lilith
turned
away
her
head
he
could
see
that
the
tears
were
not
far
away
her
lips
were
quivering
i
likewise
told
you
you
were
groping
after
an
ideal
he
went
on
and
i
found
it
perhaps
i
had
already
found
it
when
i
asked
the
question
oh
laurence
life
is
all
wrong
all
horribly
wrong
and
out
of
joint
she
burst
forth
with
a
passionate
catch
in
her
voice
as
she
turned
and
faced
him
once
more
yes
i
know
it
is
i
came
to
that
conclusion
a
goodish
while
ago
and
have
never
seen
any
reason
since
to
doubt
its
absolute
accuracy
all
out
of
joint
she
repeated
hopelessly
it
is
as
if
our
lives
had
been
placed
opposite
each
other
on
parallel
lines
and
then
one
of
the
lines
had
been
moved
then
our
lives
lay
apart
forever
that
about
it
she
was
not
deceived
his
tone
was
hard
to
all
appearances
indifferent
yet
not
to
her
ear
did
it
so
ring
she
knew
the
immensity
of
effort
that
kept
it
and
what
lay
behind
it
under
control
then
she
broke
down
entirely
laurence
my
love
my
doubly
lost
love
she
uttered
through
a
choking
whirlwind
of
sobs
teach
me
some
of
your
strength
some
of
your
hardness
then
perhaps
i
can
bear
things
better
a
chain
is
no
stronger
than
its
weakest
link
remember
and
perhaps
you
have
shown
me
the
weak
link
here
that
of
my
child
i
would
not
teach
you
an
iota
of
it
if
i
could
it
is
good
for
me
but
no
woman
was
ever
the
better
for
it
yet
but
keep
yourself
in
hand
now
we
are
in
a
public
place
although
a
comparatively
secluded
one
for
your
own
sake
do
not
give
way
and
for
the
very
reason
that
i
feared
to
stir
up
old
memories
i
had
intended
to
go
through
without
attempting
to
see
you
once
more
tell
me
one
thing
would
it
have
been
better
had
i
done
so
better
had
you
done
so
no
no
a
thousand
times
no
laurence
my
darling
i
shall
treasure
up
this
last
hour
we
have
spent
together
shall
treasure
it
as
the
sweetest
of
memories
as
long
as
life
shall
last
and
i
shall
treasure
up
that
reply
listen
twice
has
your
love
stood
between
me
and
death
as
i
have
told
you
yet
of
the
third
time
i
have
never
told
you
it
was
the
day
i
decided
to
go
i
had
done
with
life
the
pistol
was
pressed
hard
against
my
forehead
i
was
gradually
trying
how
much
more
pressure
the
trigger
would
bear
a
breadth
would
have
done
it
then
it
seemed
that
your
voice
was
in
my
ear
your
form
stood
before
me
i
tell
you
lilith
you
saved
me
that
day
as
surely
as
though
you
had
actually
been
within
the
room
i
put
the
pistol
down
i
did
this
wonderingly
why
that
must
have
been
the
day
i
had
that
awful
dream
it
was
hazon
came
in
just
after
and
we
made
our
plans
for
the
expedition
i
remember
telling
you
of
it
that
same
afternoon
why
then
if
this
is
so
it
must
have
been
with
some
great
purpose
she
cried
brightening
up
a
strange
wistful
smile
illumining
her
face
oh
how
glad
i
am
you
have
told
me
this
for
now
i
can
see
comfort
strength
in
some
mysterious
way
it
seems
as
if
our
two
lives
were
intertwined
that
it
would
ever
be
in
my
power
in
some
dim
way
to
watch
over
yours
my
darling
my
darling
until
this
moment
i
had
not
the
strength
to
part
with
you
now
i
have
let
me
do
so
before
it
leaves
me
for
we
have
been
here
a
very
long
time
i
would
have
seen
you
off
on
board
but
that
i
dare
not
i
simply
lack
the
strength
of
will
to
bear
that
laurence
my
dear
one
we
had
better
say
here
not
in
the
crowded
street
then
i
will
go
alone
both
had
risen
and
were
holding
each
other
hands
were
gazing
into
each
other
eyes
thus
they
stood
for
a
moment
nobody
was
in
sight
lilith
lifted
her
lips
and
they
moved
in
a
barely
audible
murmur
my
ideal
one
long
close
farewell
kiss
and
she
was
gone
and
the
man
as
he
flung
himself
back
on
the
garden
seat
with
his
eyes
fixed
dreamily
on
the
jutting
end
of
the
massive
rock
wall
of
table
mountain
towering
on
high
to
the
cloudless
blue
realized
at
that
moment
no
elation
such
as
one
might
feel
who
had
found
considerable
wealth
and
was
returning
full
of
hard
firm
health
to
enjoy
the
same
more
than
ever
at
that
moment
did
life
seem
to
him
all
out
of
joint
more
than
ever
if
possible
for
his
had
been
one
of
those
lives
which
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
never
seems
to
be
anything
else
chapter
xxxi
conclusion
well
fay
i
think
that
about
enough
for
one
lesson
down
you
get
just
once
more
round
the
park
father
was
the
pleading
rejoinder
i
quite
beginning
to
feel
at
home
on
tricksie
now
laurence
gave
way
and
tricksie
darted
off
perhaps
a
trifle
too
vivaciously
for
a
learner
of
the
noble
art
of
horsemanship
but
the
girl
kept
her
seat
bravely
and
the
conceded
scamper
being
brought
to
a
close
she
came
round
to
where
laurence
awaited
and
slid
from
her
saddle
father
i
wo
have
you
call
it
any
more
she
cried
i
can
ride
now
ride
do
you
hear
oh
can
you
laughed
laurence
thinking
what
a
pretty
picture
she
made
standing
there
with
the
full
light
of
the
setting
sun
tinting
the
golden
waves
of
her
hair
playing
upon
the
great
dark
eyes
indeed
he
owned
inwardly
to
a
weakness
a
soft
place
as
strange
as
it
was
unwonted
for
this
child
of
his
yet
she
was
something
more
than
a
child
now
quite
a
tall
slip
of
a
girl
at
the
angular
age
but
there
was
nothing
awkward
or
angular
even
then
about
fay
stanninghame
well
hitch
up
the
pony
to
the
rail
there
he
went
on
those
two
scamps
can
take
him
in
when
they
are
tired
of
careering
around
and
whooping
like
sioux
on
the
the
two
boys
also
happy
in
the
possession
of
a
pony
apiece
had
lost
no
time
either
in
learning
to
ride
it
there
no
part
of
a
fool
about
either
of
those
chaps
said
laurence
more
to
himself
than
to
the
girl
as
he
watched
the
two
circling
at
full
gallop
in
and
out
among
the
trees
absolutely
devoid
of
fear
stroll
a
little
fay
or
would
you
rather
go
in
of
course
i
would
linking
her
arm
in
his
father
are
we
very
rich
now
oh
pretty
warm
think
it
fun
eh
child
fun
why
it
heavenly
this
lovely
place
oh
sometimes
i
dream
that
this
all
a
dream
and
then
to
wake
up
and
find
it
real
well
dear
be
as
happy
as
you
like
now
all
day
and
every
day
you
have
had
enough
of
the
other
thing
to
last
you
a
precious
long
time
they
strolled
on
through
the
sweet
may
evening
on
beneath
a
great
beech
hanger
where
cushats
cooed
softly
among
the
green
mast
and
the
air
was
musical
with
the
sweet
piping
of
thrushes
and
the
caw
of
homing
rooks
here
and
there
a
gap
in
the
hawthorn
hedge
disclosed
a
glimpse
of
roof
and
farm
stack
and
nestling
among
the
trees
of
the
park
the
chimneys
of
the
hall
laurence
stanninghame
had
found
this
place
by
a
mere
chance
he
might
have
purchased
it
for
a
third
of
its
value
but
he
preferred
not
possibly
he
distrusted
the
wandering
blood
within
him
possibly
he
did
not
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
where
he
had
found
the
great
diamonds
he
had
certainly
left
behind
many
more
to
be
found
or
not
at
some
future
time
so
he
rented
the
house
and
park
and
extensive
shooting
and
fishing
rights
no
more
pinching
and
scraping
now
to
the
children
this
change
was
as
fay
had
said
heavenly
how
do
people
get
rich
in
africa
father
said
the
latter
as
they
turned
homeward
in
various
ways
they
find
gold
mines
with
no
gold
in
them
and
then
sell
shares
in
them
to
a
pack
of
idiots
for
a
great
deal
of
money
or
they
perhaps
find
a
few
diamonds
themselves
or
they
trade
in
all
sorts
of
things
ivory
and
so
forth
he
had
stopped
to
light
a
pipe
fay
intently
watching
his
face
through
the
clouds
of
smoke
he
was
puffing
forth
detected
a
lurking
quizzical
expression
in
his
eyes
which
roused
her
scepticism
i
never
quite
know
whether
you
are
serious
or
not
father
she
said
but
you
never
tell
us
any
stories
about
africa
i
got
out
of
practice
for
little
one
but
colonel
hewett
tells
us
plenty
naming
a
neighbour
and
yet
he
has
been
so
much
in
africa
as
you
have
ah
he
never
get
out
of
practice
in
that
line
returned
laurence
with
the
same
quizzical
laugh
what
a
lot
of
adventures
you
must
have
had
father
went
on
fay
wistfully
for
this
was
a
sore
subject
both
with
herself
and
her
brothers
they
had
expected
tale
upon
tale
of
peril
of
lions
and
crocodiles
and
snakes
and
fighting
zulus
but
woeful
disappointment
awaited
the
last
topic
the
returned
wanderer
seemed
to
care
to
talk
upon
was
that
of
his
wanderings
before
they
regained
the
house
they
were
joined
by
the
two
boys
happy
and
healthy
with
their
recent
gallop
and
full
of
the
trout
they
were
going
to
catch
on
the
morrow
under
the
tuition
of
the
keeper
laurence
dismissing
them
for
a
while
entered
quietly
by
a
back
way
the
post
had
come
in
and
with
it
an
african
mail
letter
this
he
carried
into
his
private
sanctum
it
was
from
holmes
i
hope
the
fellow
is
going
to
make
trouble
he
said
to
himself
with
a
slight
clouding
of
the
brow
he
idiot
enough
to
turn
pious
repentant
i
suppose
they
would
call
it
and
give
the
whole
thing
away
but
a
curse
can
come
of
it
the
curse
of
blood
the
young
fool
said
or
words
to
that
effect
i
wonder
what
sort
of
a
it
is
that
puts
one
in
possession
of
all
this
looking
out
upon
the
soft
peaceful
english
landscape
hayfield
and
wooded
hill
slumbering
in
the
gathering
dusk
as
if
there
could
be
a
greater
curse
anyhow
than
being
condemned
to
go
through
life
that
most
pitiable
object
a
pauper
with
sixteen
quarterings
no
no
he
tore
open
the
envelope
and
in
the
fading
light
ran
rapidly
over
its
contents
hazon
had
returned
to
johannesburg
and
had
wound
up
all
their
affairs
and
each
of
them
was
in
possession
of
more
than
a
small
fortune
there
was
nothing
however
of
the
remorseful
or
the
morbid
about
the
writer
now
and
turning
over
the
page
laurence
broke
into
a
short
half
laugh
for
there
followed
the
announcement
of
engagement
to
mabel
falkner
of
the
blue
eyes
and
the
usual
transports
and
rhapsodies
attendant
upon
such
a
communication
skipping
the
bulk
of
this
laurence
returned
the
missive
to
his
pocket
with
another
sneering
laugh
we
shall
hear
no
more
about
a
on
our
good
fortune
now
friend
holmes
he
said
to
himself
for
you
are
entering
upon
an
institution
calculated
to
knock
out
all
such
quixotic
niceties
ha
ha
i
be
in
the
least
surprised
if
in
a
little
while
you
did
hanker
to
start
again
upon
another
trade
but
holmes
letter
had
as
it
were
let
in
a
waft
of
the
dark
cloud
of
the
past
upon
the
fair
and
smiling
peacefulness
of
the
present
and
he
fell
to
thinking
on
what
strange
experiences
had
been
his
of
the
consistent
and
unswerving
irony
of
life
as
he
had
known
it
every
conventionality
violated
every
rule
of
morality
each
set
aside
had
brought
him
nothing
but
good
had
brought
nothing
but
good
to
him
and
his
had
he
grovelled
on
in
humdrum
respectability
what
would
have
befallen
him
and
them
for
him
the
stereotyped
temporary
insanity
verdict
of
a
coroner
jury
for
them
well
heaven
only
knew
whereas
now
at
this
stage
an
impulse
moved
him
and
opening
a
locked
cabinet
he
took
forth
something
and
as
he
examined
it
the
associations
of
the
thing
and
the
fast
darkening
room
brought
back
the
vision
of
glooming
rock
walls
and
a
perfectly
defenceless
man
weighed
down
with
horror
and
dread
may
i
come
in
father
but
you
are
in
the
dark
it
was
fay
voice
he
half
started
so
rapt
was
he
in
his
meditations
that
soon
remedied
he
said
striking
a
light
yes
come
in
little
one
you
were
asking
about
this
thing
once
look
at
it
queer
sort
of
weapon
is
it
it
is
indeed
she
answered
is
it
a
zulu
war
club
why
the
head
is
made
of
brass
or
is
it
gold
and
look
there
is
some
strange
writing
on
it
and
the
handle
is
a
bone
yes
the
head
is
gold
and
i
put
the
thing
together
when
i
had
no
other
weapon
ay
and
used
it
too
in
the
ghastliest
kind
of
fight
i
ever
was
in
come
now
we
will
put
it
away
again
not
yet
father
show
me
some
more
queer
things
she
pleaded
nestling
to
his
side
then
he
got
out
other
trophies
and
curios
and
fay
spent
a
good
hour
of
unalloyed
delight
turning
them
wonderingly
over
and
drinking
in
the
incident
more
or
less
stirring
which
related
to
each
but
there
was
one
thing
he
did
not
show
her
one
thing
upon
which
no
eye
save
his
own
might
ever
again
rest
one
thing
he
treasured
up
in
the
greatest
security
under
lock
and
key
which
was
enshrined
within
his
mind
as
a
hallowed
charm
and
that
was
the
metal
box
and
its
contents
the
charm
which
twice
had
stood
between
him
and
death
death
violent
and
horrible
the
sign
of
the
spider
