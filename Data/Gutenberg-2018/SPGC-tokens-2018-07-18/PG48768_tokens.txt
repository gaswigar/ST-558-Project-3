oration
vi
introduction
to
oration
vi
the
sixth
oration
is
a
sermon
or
rather
a
scolding
addressed
to
the
new
cynics
and
especially
to
one
of
their
number
who
had
ventured
to
defame
the
memory
of
diogenes
in
the
fourth
christian
century
the
cynic
mode
of
life
was
adopted
by
many
but
the
vast
majority
were
illiterate
men
who
imitated
the
cynic
shamelessness
of
manners
but
not
the
genuine
discipline
the
αὐτάρκεια
which
had
ennobled
the
lives
of
antisthenes
diogenes
and
crates
to
the
virtues
of
these
great
men
julian
endeavours
to
recall
the
worthless
cynics
of
his
day
in
the
two
centuries
that
had
elapsed
since
lucian
wrote
for
the
edification
of
degenerate
cynics
the
life
of
the
cynic
demonax
the
dignified
and
witty
friend
of
epictetus
the
followers
of
that
sect
had
still
further
deteriorated
the
new
cynics
may
be
compared
with
the
worst
type
of
mendicant
friar
of
the
middle
ages
and
julian
saw
in
their
assumption
of
the
outward
signs
of
cynicism
the
coarse
cloak
the
staff
and
wallet
and
long
hair
the
same
hypocrisy
and
greed
that
characterised
certain
of
the
christian
monks
of
his
day
the
resemblances
between
the
christians
and
the
cynics
had
already
been
pointed
out
by
aristides
and
while
in
julian
s
eyes
they
were
equally
impious
he
has
an
additional
grievance
against
the
cynics
in
that
they
brought
discredit
on
philosophy
like
the
christians
they
were
unlettered
they
were
disrespectful
to
the
gods
whom
julian
was
trying
to
restore
they
had
flattered
and
fawned
on
constantius
and
far
from
practising
the
austerities
of
diogenes
they
were
no
better
than
parasites
on
society
in
this
as
in
the
seventh
oration
julian
s
aim
is
to
reform
the
new
cynics
but
still
more
to
demonstrate
the
essential
unity
of
philosophy
he
sympathised
profoundly
with
the
tenets
of
cynicism
and
ranked
diogenes
with
socrates
as
a
moral
teacher
he
reminds
the
cynics
whom
he
satirises
that
the
famous
admonition
of
diogenes
to
countermark
or
forge
a
new
coinage
is
not
to
be
taken
as
an
excuse
for
license
and
impudence
but
like
the
delphic
precept
know
thyself
warns
all
philosophers
to
accept
no
traditional
authority
no
convention
that
has
not
been
examined
and
approved
by
the
reason
of
the
individual
his
conviction
that
all
philosophical
tenets
are
in
harmony
if
rightly
understood
gives
a
peculiar
earnestness
to
his
apologia
for
diogenes
the
reference
in
the
first
paragraph
to
the
summer
solstice
seems
to
indicate
that
the
oration
was
written
before
julian
left
constantinople
in
order
to
prepare
for
the
persian
campaign

behold
the
rivers
are
flowing
backwards
as
the
proverb
says
here
is
a
cynic
who
says
that
diogenes
was
conceited
and
who
refuses
to
take
cold
baths
for
fear
they
may
injure
him
though
he
has
a
very
strong
constitution
and
is
lusty
and
in
the
prime
of
life
and
this
too
though
the
is
now
nearing
the
summer
solstice
moreover
he
even
ridicules
the
eating
of
octopus
and
says
that
diogenes
paid
a
sufficient
penalty
for
his
folly
and
vanity
in
that
he
perished
of
this
diet
as
though
by
a
draught
of
hemlock
so
far
indeed
is
he
advanced
in
wisdom
that
he
knows
for
certain
that
death
is
an
evil
yet
this
even
the
wise
socrates
thought
he
did
not
know
yes
and
after
him
diogenes
as
well
at
any
rate
when
antisthenes
was
suffering
from
a
long
and
incurable
illness
diogenes
handed
him
a
dagger
with
these
words
in
case
you
need
the
aid
of
a
so
convinced
was
he
that
there
is
nothing
terrible
or
grievous
in
death
but
we
who
have
inherited
his
staff
know
out
of
our
greater
wisdom
that
death
is
a
calamity
and
we
say
that
sickness
is
even
more
terrible
than
death
and
cold
harder
to
bear
than
sickness
for
the
man
who
is
sick
is
often
tenderly
nursed
so
that
his
is
straightway
converted
into
a
luxury
especially
if
he
be
rich
indeed
i
myself
by
zeus
have
observed
that
certain
persons
are
more
luxurious
in
sickness
than
in
health
though
even
in
health
they
were
conspicuous
for
luxury
and
so
it
once
occurred
to
me
to
say
to
certain
of
my
friends
that
it
were
better
for
those
men
to
be
servants
than
masters
and
to
be
poor
and
more
naked
than
the
lily
of
the
field
than
to
be
rich
as
they
now
are
for
they
would
have
ceased
being
at
once
sick
and
luxurious
the
fact
is
that
some
people
think
it
a
fine
thing
to
make
a
display
of
their
ailments
and
to
play
the
part
of
luxurious
invalids
but
says
someone
is
not
a
man
who
has
to
endure
cold
and
to
support
heat
really
more
miserable
than
the
sick
well
at
any
rate
he
has
no
comforts
to
mitigate
his
sufferings

come
now
let
me
set
down
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
what
i
learned
from
my
teachers
about
the
cynics
so
that
all
who
are
entering
on
this
mode
of
life
may
consider
it
and
if
they
are
convinced
by
what
i
say
those
who
are
now
aiming
to
be
cynics
will
i
am
sure
be
none
the
worse
for
it
and
if
they
are
unconvinced
but
cherish
aims
that
are
brilliant
and
noble
and
set
themselves
above
my
argument
not
in
words
only
but
in
deeds
then
my
discourse
will
at
any
rate
put
no
hindrance
in
their
way
but
if
there
are
others
already
enslaved
by
greed
or
or
to
sum
it
up
briefly
in
a
single
phrase
by
the
pleasures
of
the
body
and
they
therefore
neglect
my
words
or
even
laugh
them
as
dogs
sometimes
defile
the
front
porticoes
of
schools
and
tis
all
one
to
hippocleides
for
indeed
we
take
no
notice
of
puppies
who
behave
in
this
fashion
come
then
let
me
pursue
my
argument
under
headings
from
the
beginning
in
due
order
so
that
by
giving
every
question
its
proper
treatment
i
may
myself
more
conveniently
achieve
what
i
have
in
mind
and
may
make
it
more
easy
for
you
also
to
follow
and
since
it
is
a
fact
that
cynicism
is
a
branch
of
philosophy
and
by
no
means
the
most
insignificant
or
least
honourable
but
rivalling
the
noblest
i
must
first
say
a
few
words
about
philosophy
itself

through
the
agency
of

with

blessings
that
we
owe
to
hermes
is
no
other
than
the
bestowal
of
reason
and
mind
for
prometheus
the
forethought
that
guides
all
things
mortal
by
infusing
into
nature
a
fiery
breath
to
serve
as
an
operative
cause

to

it
could

now
some
think
that
a
single
substance
is
the
basis
of
all
these
and
others
that
they
differ
essentially
according
to
their
species
but
this
question
we
must
not
discuss
as
yet
or
rather
not
at
all
in
the
present
discourse
and
we
need
only
say
that
whether
one
regards
philosophy
as
some
people
do
as
the
art
of
arts
and
the
science
of
sciences
or
as
an
effort
to
become
like
god
as
far
as
one
may
or
whether
as
the
pythian
oracle
said
it
means
know
thyself
will
make
no
difference
to
my
argument
for
all
these
definitions
are
evidently
very
closely

another

however
let
us
begin
with
know
thyself
since
this
precept
is
divinely
inspired
it
follows
that
he
who
knows
himself
will
know
not
only
about
his
soul
but
his
body
also
and
it
will
not
be
enough
to
know
that
a
man
is
a
soul
employing
a
body
but
he
will
also
investigate
the
essential
nature
of
the
soul
and
then
trace
out
its
faculties
and
not
even
this
alone
will
be
enough
for
him
but
in
addition
he
will
investigate
whatever
exists
in
us
nobler
and
more
divine
than
the
soul
that
something
which
we
all
believe
in
without
being
taught
and
regard
as
divine
and
all
in
common
suppose
to
be
established
in
the
heavens
then
again
as
he
investigates
the
first
principles
of
the
body
he
will
observe
whether
it
is
composite
or
simple
then
proceeding
systematically
he
will
observe
its
harmony
and
the
influences
that
affect
it
and
its
capacity
and
in
a
word
all
that
it
needs
to
ensure
its
permanence
and
in
the
next
place
he
will
also
observe
the
first
principles
of
certain
arts
by
which
the
body
is
assisted
to
that
permanence
for
instance
medicine
husbandry
and
the
like
and
of
such
arts
as
are
useless
and
superfluous
he
will
not
be
wholly
ignorant
since
these
too
have
been
devised
to
humour
the
emotional
part
of
our
souls
for
though
he
will
avoid
the
persistent
study
of
these
last
because
he
thinks
such
persistent
study
disgraceful
and
will
avoid
what
seems
to
involve
hard
work
in
those
subjects
nevertheless
he
will
not
generally
speaking
remain
in
ignorance
of
their
apparent
nature
and
what
parts
of
the
soul
they
suit
reflect
therefore
whether
knowledge
does
not
control
every
science
and
every
art
and
moreover
whether
it
does
not
include
the
knowledge
of
universals
for
to
know
things
divine
through
the
divine
part
in
us
and
mortal
things
too
through
the
part
of
us
that
is
the
oracle
declared
to
be
the
duty
of
the
living
organism
that
is
midway
between
these
namely
man
because
individually
he
is
mortal
but
regarded
as
a
whole
he
is
immortal
and
moreover
singly
and
individually
is
compounded
of
a
mortal
and
an
immortal
part

further
that
to
make
oneself
like
god
as
far
as
possible
is
nothing
else
than
to
acquire
such
knowledge
of
the
essential
nature
of
things
as
is
attainable
by
mankind
is
evident
from
the
following
it
is
not
on
the
score
of
abundance
of
possessions
that
we
count
the
divine
nature
happy
nor
on
the
score
of
any
other
of
those
things
that
are
commonly
believed
to
be
advantages
but
it
is
because
as
homer
says

δέ

πάντα
ἴσασι
the
gods
know
all
things
καὶ
μέντοι
καὶ
περὶ

and
indeed
he
says
also
of
zeus
ἀλλὰ

σύμφωνα
for
it
is
in
knowledge
that
the
gods
surpass
ourselves
and
it
may
well
be
that
with
them
also
what
ranks
as
noblest
is
in
proportion
then
as
they
are
nobler
than
we
in
their
essential
nature
that
of
theirs
is
a
knowledge
of
higher
things
therefore
i
say
let
no
one
divide
philosophy
into
many
kinds
or
cut
it
up
into
many
parts
or
rather
let
no
one
make
it
out
to
be
plural
instead
of
one
for
even
as
truth
is
one
so
too
philosophy
is
one
but
it
is
not
surprising
that
we
travel
to
it
now
by
one
road
now
by
another
for
if
any
stranger
or
by
zeus
any
one
of
her
oldest
inhabitants
wished
to
go
up
to
athens
he
could
either
sail
or
go
by
road
and
if
he
travelled
by
land
he
could
i
suppose
take
either
the
broad
highways
or
the
paths
and
roads
that
are
short
cuts
and
moreover
he
could
either
sail
along
the
coasts
or
like
the
old
man
of
pylos
cleave
the
open
and
let
no
one
try
to
refute
me
by
pointing
out
that
some
philosophers
in
travelling
by
those
very
roads
have
been
known
to
lose
their
way
and
arriving
in
some
other
place
have
been
captivated
as
though
by
circe
or
the
that
is
to
say
by
pleasure
or
opinion
or
some
other
bait
and
so
have
failed
to
go
straight
forward
and
attain
their
goal
rather
he
must
consider
those
who
in
every
one
of
the
philosophic
sects
did
attain
the
highest
rank
and
he
will
find
that
all
their
doctrines
agree

therefore
the
god
at

proclaims
know
thyself
and
heracleitus
says
i
searched
myself
and
pythagoras
also
and
his
school
and
his
followers
down
to
theophrastus
bid
us
become
like
god
as
far
as
possible
yes
and
aristotle
too
for
what
we
are
sometimes
god
is
always
it
would
therefore
be
absurd
that
god
should
not
know
himself
for
he
will
know
nothing
at
all
about
other
things
if
he
be
ignorant
of
himself
for
he
is
himself
everything
seeing
that
in
himself
and
near
himself
he
keeps
the
causes
of
all
things
that
in
any
way
whatever
have
existence
whether
they
be
immortal
causes
of
things
immortal
or
causes
of

things
though
themselves
not
mortal
or
perishable
for
imperishable
and
are
the
causes
of
perpetual
generation
for
the
perishable
world
but
this
line
of
argument
is
too
lofty

the
occasion

now
truth
is
one
and
philosophy
is
one
and
they
whom
i
just
now
spoke
of
are
its
lovers
one
and
all
and
also
they
whom
i
ought
in
fairness
to
mention
now
by
name
i
mean
the
disciples
of
the
man
of
citium
for
when
they
saw
that
the
cities
of
greece
were
averse
to
the
excessive
plainness
and
simplicity
of
the
cynic
s
freedom
of
manners
they
hedged
him
about
with
screens
as
it
were
i
mean
with
maxims
on
the
management
of
the
household
and
business
and
intercourse
with
one
s
wife
and
the
rearing
of
children
to
the
end
i
believe
that
they
might
make
him
the
intimate
guardian
of
the
public
welfare
and
that
they
too
held
the
maxim
know
thyself
to
be
the
first
principle
of
their
philosophy
you
may
believe
if
you
will
not
only
from
the
works
that
they
composed
on
this
very
subject
but
even
more
from
what
they
made
the
end
and
aim
of
their
philosophic
teaching
for
this
end
of
theirs
was
life
in
harmony
with
nature
and
this
it
is
impossible
for
any
man
to
attain
who
does
not
know
who
and
of
what
nature
he
is
for
a
man
who
does
not
know
himself
will
certainly
not
know
what
it
is
becoming
for
him
to
do
just
as
he
who
does
not
know
the
nature
of
iron
will
not
know
whether
it
is
suitable
to
cut
with
or
not
and
how
iron
must
be
treated
so
that
it
may
be
put
to
its
proper
use
for
the
moment
however
i
have
said
enough
to
show
that
philosophy
is
one
and
that
to
speak
generally
all
philosophers
have
a
single
aim
though
they
arrive
at
that
aim
by
different
roads
and
now
let
us
consider
the
cynic
philosophy

by
these
and
to
try
in
each
case
to
refute
the
opinions
that
i
hold
on
the
subject
and
then
if
they
proved
to
be
in
harmony
with
those
original
doctrines
he
could
not
attack
me
for
bearing
false
witness
but
if
they
proved
not
to
be
in
harmony
then
he
could
have
barred
my
opinions
from
a
hearing
as
the
athenians
barred
spurious
documents
from
the
metroum
but
as
i
said
nothing
of
that
sort
exists
for
the
tragedies
of
diogenes
are
now
said
to
be
the
work
of
a
certain
philiscus
of
aegina
though
even
if
they
were
by
diogenes
there
would
be
nothing
out
of
the
way
in
a
wise
man
s
jesting
since
many
philosophers
have
been
known
to
do
so
for
democritus
also
we
are
told
used
to
laugh
when
he
saw
men
taking
things
seriously
well
then
i
say
we
must
not
pay
any
attention
to
their
frivolous
writings
like
men
who
have
no
desire
at
all
to
learn
anything
of
serious
interest
such
men
when
they
arrive
at
a
prosperous
city
abounding
in
sacrifices
and
secret
rites
of
many
kinds
and
containing
within
it
countless
holy
priests
who
dwell
in
the
sacred
enclosures
priests
who
for
this
very
purpose
i
mean
in
order
to
purify
everything
that
is
within
their
gates
have
expelled
all
that
is
sordid
and
superfluous
and
vicious
from
the
city
public
baths
and
brothels
and
retail
shops
and
everything
of
the
sort
without
exception
such
men
i
say
having
come
as
far
as
the
quarter
where
all
such
things
are
do
not
enter
the
city
itself
surely
a
man
who
when
he
comes
upon
the
things
that
have
been
expelled
thinks
that
this
is
the
city
is
despicable
indeed
if
he
depart
on
the
instant
but
still
more
despicable
if
he
stay
in
that
lower
region
when
he
might
by
taking
but
a
step
across
the
threshold
behold
socrates
himself
for
i
will
borrow
those
famous
phrases
of
alcibiades
in
his
praise
of
socrates
and
i
assert
that
the
cynic
philosophy
is
very
like
those
images
of
silenus
that
sit
in
the
shops
of
the
statuaries
which
the
craftsmen
make
with
pipes
or
flutes
in
their
hands
but
when
you
open
them
you
see
that
inside
they
contain
statues
of
the
gods
accordingly
that
we
may
not
make
that
sort
of
mistake
and
think
that
his
jesting
was
sober
earnest
for
though
there
is
a
certain
use
even
in
those
jests
yet
cynicism
itself
is
something
very
different
as
i
shall
presently
try
to
prove
let
us
consider
it
in
due
course
from
its
actual
practice
and
pursue
it
like
hounds
that
track
down
wild
beasts
in
the
chase

τὴν
ἐν

now
the
founder
of
this
philosophy
to
whom
we
are
to
attribute
it
in
the
first
instance
is
not
easy
to
discover
even
though
some
think
that
the
title
belongs
to
antisthenes
and
diogenes
at
least
the
saying
of
oenomaus
seems
to
be
not
without
good
grounds
the
cynic
philosophy
is
neither
antisthenism
nor
moreover
the
better
sort
of
cynics
assert
that
in
addition
to
the
other
blessings
bestowed
on
us
by
mighty
heracles
it
was
he
who
bequeathed
to
mankind
the
noblest
example
of
this
mode
of
life
but
for
my
part
while
i
desire
to
speak
with
due
reverence
of
the
gods
and
of
those
who
have
attained
to
their
functions
i
still
believe
that
even
before
heracles
not
only
among
the
greeks
but
among
the
barbarians
also
there
were
men
who
practised
this
philosophy
for
it
seems
to
be
in
some
ways
a
universal
philosophy
and
the
most
natural
and
to
demand
no
special
study
whatsoever
but
it
is
enough
simply
to
choose
the
honourable
by
desiring
virtue
and
avoiding
evil
and
so
there
is
no
need
to
turn
over
countless
books
for
as
the
saying
goes
much
learning
does
not
teach
men
to
have
nor
is
it
necessary
to
subject
oneself
to
any
part
of
such
a
discipline
as
they
must
undergo
who
enter
other
philosophic
sects
nay
it
is
enough
merely
to
hearken
to
the
pythian
god
when
he
enjoins
these
two
precepts
know
thyself
and
falsify
the
common
hence
it
becomes
evident
to
us
that
the
founder
of
this
philosophy
is
he
who
i
believe
is
the
cause
of
all
the
blessings
that
the
greeks
enjoy
the
universal
leader
and
king
of
hellas
i
mean
the
god
of
delphi
and
since
it
was
not
permitted
that
he
should
be
in
ignorance
of
aught
the
peculiar
fitness
of
diogenes
did
not
escape
his
notice
and
he
made
him
incline
to
that
philosophy
not
by
urging
his
commands
in
words
alone
as
he
does
for
other
men
but
in
very
deed
he
instructed
him
symbolically
as
to
what
he
willed
in
two
words
when
he
said
falsify
the
common
for
know
thyself
he
addressed
not
only
to
diogenes
but
to
other
men
also
and
still
does
for
it
stands
there
engraved
in
front
of
his
shrine
and
so
we
have
at
last
discovered
the
founder
of
this
philosophy
even
as
the
divine
iamblichus
also
declares
yes
and
we
have
discovered
its
leading
men
as
well
namely
antisthenes
and
diogenes
and
crates
the
aim
and
end
of
whose
lives
was
i
think
to
know
themselves
to
despise
vain
opinions
and
to
lay
hold
of
truth
with
their
whole
understanding
for
truth
alike
for
gods
and
men
is
the
beginning
of
every
good
thing
and
it
was
i
think
for
her
sake
that
plato
and
pythagoras
and
socrates
and
the
peripatetic
philosophers
and
zeno
spared
no
pains
because
they
wished
to
know
themselves
and
not
to
follow
vain
opinions
but
to
track
down
truth
among
all
things
that
are

and
now
since
it
has
become
evident
that
plato
was
not
pursuing
one
aim
and
diogenes
another
but
their
end
was
one
and
the
same
suppose
one
should
inquire
of
the
wise
plato
what
value
do
you
set
on
the
precept
know
thyself
i
am
very
sure
that
he
would
answer
that
it
is
worth
everything
and
indeed
he
says
so
in
the
alcibiades
come
then
tell
us
next
divine
plato
scion
of
the
gods
how
one
ought
to
be
disposed
towards
the
opinions
of
the
many
he
will
give
the
same
answer
and
moreover
he
will
expressly
enjoin
on
us
to
read
his
dialogue
the
crito
where
socrates
is
shown
warning
us
not
to
take
heed
of
such
things
at
any
rate
what
he
says
is
but
why
my
dear
good
crito
are
we
so
concerned
about
the
opinion
of
the
multitude
and
now
are
we
to
ignore
all
this
evidence
and
without
further
question
fence
off
from
one
another
and
force
apart
men
whom
the
passion
for
truth
the
scorn
of
opinion
and
unanimity
in
zeal
for
virtue
have
joined
together
and
if
plato
chose
to
achieve
his
aim
through
words
whereas
for
diogenes
deeds
sufficed
does
the
latter
on
that
account
deserve
to
be
criticised
by
you
nay
consider
whether
that
same
method
of
his
be
not
in
every
respect
superior
since
we
see
that
plato
for
himself
forswore
written
compositions
for
he
says
there
are
no
writings
by
plato
nor
ever
will
be
and
what
now
pass
current
as
his
are
the
work
of
socrates
the
ever
fair
and
ever
why
then
should
we
not
from
the
practice
of
diogenes
study
the
character
of
the
cynic
philosophy

now
the
body
consists
of
certain
parts
such
as
eyes
feet
and
hands
but
there
are
besides
other
parts
hair
nails
ordure
a
whole
class
of
accessories
of
that
sort
without
which
the
human
body
can
not
exist
then
is
it
not
absurd
for
a
man
to
take
into
account
such
parts
i
mean
hair
or
nails
or
ordure
or
such
unpleasant
accessories
rather
than
those
parts
that
are
most
precious
and
important
in
the
first
place
for
instance
the
organs
of
perception
and
among
these
more
especially
the
instruments
whereby
we
apprehend
namely
the
eyes
and
ears
for
these
aid
the
soul
to
think
intelligently
whether
it
be
buried
deep
in
the
body
and
they
enable
it
to
purify
itself
more
readily
and
to
use
its
pure
and
steadfast
faculty
of
thought
or
whether
as
some
think
it
is
through
them
that
the
soul
enters
in
as
though
by
channels
for
as
we
are
told
by
collecting
individual
perceptions
and
linking
them
through
the
memory
she
brings
forth
the
sciences
and
for
my
own
part
i
think
that
if
there
were
not
something
of
this
sort
either
incomplete
in
itself
or
perfect
but
hindered
by
other
things
many
and
various
which
brings
about
our
apprehension
of
externals
it
would
not
even
be
possible
for
us
to
apprehend
the
objects
of
but
this
line
of
argument
has
little
to
do
with
the
present
question

accordingly
we
must
go
back
to
the
divisions
of
the
cynic
philosophy
for
the
cynics
also
seem
to
have
thought
that
there
were
two
branches
of
philosophy
as
did
aristotle
and
plato
namely
speculative
and
practical
evidently
because
they
had
observed
and
understood
that
man
is
by
nature
suited
both
to
action
and
to
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
and
though
they
avoided
the
study
of
natural
philosophy
that
does
not
affect
the
argument
for
socrates
and
many
others
also
as
we
know
devoted
themselves
to
speculation
but
it
was
solely
for
practical
ends
for
they
thought
that
even
meant
learning
precisely
what
must
be
assigned
to
the
soul
and
what
to
the
body
and
to
the
soul
they
naturally
assigned
supremacy
and
to
the
body
subjection
this
seems
to
be
the
reason
why
they
practised
virtue
modesty
and
freedom
and
why
they
shunned
all
forms
of
envy
cowardice
and
superstition
but
this
you
will
say
is
not
the
view
that
we
hold
about
them
for
we
are
to
think
that
they
were
not
in
earnest
and
that
they
hazarded
what
is
most
precious
in
thus
despising
the
body
as
socrates
did
when
he
declared
and
rightly
that
philosophy
is
a
preparation
for
death
and
since
this
was
the
aim
that
the
cynics
pursued
daily
we
need
not
emulate
them
any
more
than
the
others
but
we
are
to
think
them
miserable
beings
and
altogether
foolish
but
why
was
it
that
they
endured
those
hardships
surely
not
from
ostentation
as
you
declared
for
how
could
they
win
applause
from
other
men
by
eating
raw
meat
certainly
you
yourself
do
not
applaud
them
for
this
at
any
rate
when
you
imitate
one
of
those
cynics
by
carrying
a
staff
and
wearing
your
hair
long
as
it
is
shown
in
their
pictures
do
you
think
that
you
thereby
gain
a
reputation
with
the
crowd
though
you
do
not
yourself
think
those
habits
worthy
of
admiration
one
or
two
indeed
used
to
applaud
him
in
his
own
day
but
more
than
ten
times
ten
thousand
had
their
stomachs
turned
by
nausea
and
loathing
and
went
fasting
until
their
attendants
revived
them
with
perfumes
and
myrrh
and
cakes
so
greatly
did
that
renowned
hero
shock
them
by
an
act
which
seems
absurd
to
men

though
by
the
gods
it
was
not
ignoble
if
one
should
explain
it
according
to
the
intention
of
diogenes
for
just
as
socrates
said
of
himself
that
he
embraced
the
life
of
because
he
believed
that
he
could
perform
his
service
to
the
god
only
by
examining
in
all
its
bearings
the
meaning
of
the
oracle
that
had
been
uttered
concerning
him
so
i
think
diogenes
also
because
he
was
convinced
that
philosophy
was
ordained
by
the
pythian
oracle
believed
that
he
ought
to
test
everything
by
facts
and
not
be
influenced
by
the
opinions
of
others
which
may
be
true
and
may
be
false
accordingly
diogenes
did
not
think
that
every
statement
of
pythagoras
or
any
man
like
pythagoras
was
necessarily
true
for
he
held
that
god
and
no
human
being
is
the
founder
of
philosophy
and
pray
what
you
will
say
has
this
to
do
with
the
eating
of
octopus

will

to
eat
meat
some
regard
as
natural
to
man
while
others
think
that
to
follow
this
practice
is
not
at
all
appropriate
for
man
and
this
question
has
been
much
debated
and
if
you
are
willing
to
make
the
effort
you
can
see
with
your
own
eyes
swarms
of
books
on
the
subject
these
diogenes
thought
it
his
duty
to
refute
at
any
rate
his
own
view
was
as
follows
if
one
can
eat
meat
without
taking
too
much
trouble
to
prepare
it
as
can
all
other
animals
to
whom
nature
has
assigned
this
diet
and
can
do
it
without
harm
or
discomfort
or
rather
with
actual
benefit
to
the
body
then
he
thought
that
eating
meat
is
entirely
in
accordance
with
nature
but
if
harm
came
of
it
then
he
apparently
thought
that
the
practice
is
not
appropriate
for
man
and
that
he
must
abstain
from
it
by
all
means
here
then
you
have
a
theory
on
this
question
though
perhaps
it
is
too
fetched
but
here
is
another
more
akin
to
cynicism
only
i
must
first
describe

freedom
from

they
regard
as
the
end
and
aim
and
this
is
equivalent
to
becoming
a
god
now
perhaps
diogenes
observed
that
in
the
case
of
all
other
foods
he
himself
had
no
particular
sensations
and
that
only
raw
meat
gave
him
indigestion
and
nausea
and
took
this
for
a
proof
that
he
was
enslaved
to
vain
opinion
rather
than
reason
for
flesh
is
none
the
less
flesh
even
though
you
cook
it
any
number
of
times
or
season
it
with
any
number
of
sauces
this
i
say
was
why
he
thought
he
ought
to
rid
and
free
himself
altogether
of
this
cowardice
for
you
may
be
sure
that
this
sort
of
thing
is
cowardice
and
in
the
name
of
the
goddess
tell
me
why
if
we
used
cooked
meats
we
do
not
eat
them
in
their
natural
state
also
you
can
give
me
no
other
answer
than
that
this
has
become
a
custom
and
a
habit
with
us
for
surely
we
can
not
say
that
before
meat
is
cooked
it
is
disgusting
and
that
by
being
cooked
it
becomes
purer
than
it
was
by
nature
what
then
was
it
right
for
him
to
do
who
had
been
appointed
by
god
like
a
general
in
command
to
do
away
with
the
common
currency
and
to
judge
all
questions
by
the
criterion
of
reason
and
truth
ought
he
to
have
shut
his
eyes
and
been
so
far
fettered
by
this
general
opinion
as
to
believe
that
flesh
by
being
cooked
becomes
pure
and
fit
for
food
but
that
when
it
has
not
been
acted
upon
by
fire
it
is
somehow
abominable
and
loathsome
is
this
the
sort
of
memory
you
have

this
your
zeal
for
truth

though

you
are

not

of
the

type
whose

it
is
to
eat
everything
even
as
the

you
recognise

suppose
the
words
of
the

almost
omitted
to
say
that
all
men
who
live
near

and
even
some
who
live
at

from
it
swallow
down
oysters
and
in
general
everything
of
the
kind
without
even
heating
them
and
then
you
think
they
are
enviable
whereas
you
regard
diogenes
as
contemptible
and
disgusting
and
you
do
not
perceive
that
those
are
flesh
just
as
much
as
what
he
ate
except
perhaps
that
differ
in
so
far
as
the
octopus
is
soft
and
are
harder
at
any
rate
the
octopus
is
bloodless
like
fish
but
the
latter
too
are
animate
things
like
the
octopus
at
least
they
feel
pleasure
and
pain
which
is
the
peculiar
characteristic
of
animate
things
and
here
we
must
not
be
put
out
by
plato
s
theory
that
plants
also
are
animated
by
soul
but
it
is
now
i
think
evident
to
those
who
are
in
any
way
able
to
follow
an
argument
that
what
the
excellent
diogenes
did
was
not
out
of
the
way
or
irregular
or
contrary
to
our
habits
that
is
if
we
do
not
in
such
cases
apply
the
criterion
of
hardness
and
softness
but
judge
rather
by
the
pleasure
or
distaste
of
the
palate
and
so
it
is
not
after
all
the
eating
of
raw
food
that
disgusts
you
since
you
do
the
like
not
only
in
the
case
of
bloodless
animals
but
also
of
those
that
have
blood
but
perhaps
there
is
also
this
difference
between
you
and
diogenes
that
he
thought
he
ought
to
eat
such
food
just
as
it
was
and
in
the
natural
state
whereas
you
think
you
must
first
prepare
it
with
salt
and
many
other
things
to
make
it
agreeable
and
so
do
violence
to
nature
i
have
now
said
enough

this
subject

now
the
end
and
aim
of
the
cynic
philosophy
as
indeed
of
every
philosophy
is
happiness
but
happiness
that
consists
in
living
according
to
nature
and
not
according
to
the
opinions
of
the
multitude
for
plants
too
are
considered
to
do
well
and
indeed
all
animals
also
when
without
hindrance
each
attains
the
end
designed
for
it
by
nature
nay
even
among
the
gods
this
is
the
definition
of
happiness
that
their
state
should
be
according
to
their
nature
and
that
they
should
be
independent
and
so
too
in
the
case
of
human
beings
we
must
not
be
busy
about
happiness
as
if
it
were
hidden
away
outside
ourselves
neither
the
eagle
nor
the
plane
tree
nor
anything
else
that
has
life
whether
plant
or
animal
vainly
troubles
itself
about
wings
or
leaves
of
gold
or
that
its
shoots
may
be
of
silver
or
its
stings
and
spurs
of
iron
or
rather
of
adamant
but
where
nature
in
the
beginning
has
adorned
them
with
such
things
they
consider
that
if
only
they
are
strong
and
serviceable
for
speed
or
defence
they
themselves
are
fortunate
and
well
provided
then
is
it
not
absurd
when
a
human
being
tries
to
find
happiness
somewhere
outside
himself
and
thinks
that
wealth
and
birth
and
the
influence
of
friends
and
generally
speaking
everything
of
that
sort
is
of
the
utmost
importance
if
however
nature
had
bestowed
on
us
only
what
she
has
bestowed
on
other
animals
i
mean
the
possession
of
bodies
and
souls
like
theirs
so
that
we
need
concern
ourselves
with
nothing
beyond
then
it
would
suffice
for
us
as
for
all
other
animals
to
content
ourselves
with
physical
advantages
and
to
pursue
happiness
within
this
field
but
in
us
has
been
implanted
a
soul
that
in
no
way
resembles
other
animals
and
whether
it
be
different
in
essence
or
not
different
in
essence
but
superior
in
its
activity
only
just
as
i
suppose
pure
gold
is
superior
to
gold
alloyed
with
sand
some
people
hold
this
theory
to
be
true
of
the
soul
any
rate
we
surely
know
that
we
are
more
intelligent
than
other
animals
for
according
to
the
myth
in
the
protagoras
nature
dealt
with
them
very
generously
and
bountifully
like
a
mother
but
to
compensate
for
all
this
mind
was
bestowed
on
us
by
zeus
therefore
in
our
minds
in
the
best
and
noblest
part
of
us
we
must
say
that
happiness
resides

ἀνὴρ
now
consider
whether
diogenes
did
not
above
all
other
men
profess
this
belief
since
he
freely
exposed
his
body
to
hardships
so
that
he
might
make
it
stronger
than
it
was
by
nature
he
allowed
himself
to
act
only
as
the
light
of
reason
shows
us
that
we
ought
to
act
and
the
perturbations
that
attack
the
soul
and
are
derived
from
the
body
to
which
this
envelope
of
ours
often
constrains
us
for
its
sake
to
pay
too
much
attention
he
did
not
take
into
account
at
all
thus
by
means
of
this
discipline
the
man
made
his
body
more
vigorous
i
believe
than
that
of
any
who
have
contended
for
the
prize
of
a
crown
in
the
games
and
his
soul
was
so
disposed
that
he
was
happy
and
a
king
no
less
if
not
even
more
than
the
great
king
as
the
greeks
used
to
call
him
in
those
days
by
which
they
meant
the
king
of
persia
then
does
he
seem
to
you
of
no
importance
this
man
who
was

not

a

of
epicurus
says
that
if
he
have
bread
enough
and
to
spare
he
is
not
inferior
to
the
gods
on
the
score
of
happiness
not
that
diogenes
tried
to
rival
the
gods
but
he
lived
more
happily
than
one
who
is
counted
the
happiest
of
men
and
he
used
actually
to
assert
that
he
lived
more
happily

such
a
man

if

do
not
believe
me
try
his

of

καί
τὸ
λεγόμενον
ὑπὸ
τοῦ
ποιητοῦ
come
let
us
first
test
it
by
reasoning
you
think
do
you
not
that
for
mankind
freedom
is
the
beginning
of
all
good
things
i
mean
of
course
what
people
are
always
calling
good
how
can
you
deny
it
for
property
money
birth
physical
strength
beauty
and
in
a
word
everything
of
the
sort
when
divorced
from
freedom
are
surely
blessings
that
belong
not
to
him
who
merely
seems
to
enjoy
them
but
to
him
who
is
that
man
s
master
whom
then
are
we
to
regard
as
a
slave
shall
it
be
him
whom
we
buy
for
so
many
silver
drachmas
for
two
minae
or
for
ten
staters
of
gold
probably
you
will
say
that
such
a
man
is
truly
a
slave
and
why
is
it
because
we
have
paid
down
money
for
him
to
the
seller
but
in
that
case
the
prisoners
of
war
whom
we
ransom
would
be
slaves
and
yet
the
law
on
the
one
hand
grants
these
their
freedom
when
they
have
come
safe
home
and
we
on
the
other
hand
ransom
them
not
that
they
may
become
slaves
but
that
they
may
be
free
do
you
see
then
that
in
order
to
make
a
ransomed
man
a
slave
it
is
not
enough
to
pay
down
a
sum
of
money
but
that
man
is
truly
a
slave
over
whom
another
man
has
power
to
compel
him
to
do
whatever
he
orders
and
if
he
refuse
to
punish
him
and
in
the
words
of
the
poet
κακαῖς
ὀδύνῃσι
to
inflict
grievous
pains
upon
him

then
consider
next
whether
we
have
not
as
many
masters
as
there
are
persons
whom
we
are
obliged
to
conciliate
in
order
not
to
suffer
pain
or
annoyance
from
being
punished
by
them
or
do
you
think
that
the
only
sort
of
punishment
is
when
a
man
lifts
up
his
stick
against
a
slave
and
strikes
him
yet
not
even
the
harshest
masters
do
this
in
the
case
of
all
their
slaves
but
a
word
or
a
threat
is
often
enough
then
never
think
my
friend
that
you
are
free
while
your
belly
rules
you
and
the
part
below
the
belly
since
you
will
then
have
masters
who
can
either
furnish
you
the
means
of
pleasure
or
deprive
you
of
them
and
even
though
you
should
prove
yourself
superior
to
these
so
long
as
you
are
a
slave
to
the
opinions
of
the
many
you
have
not
yet
approached
freedom
or
tasted
its
nectar

by
this
that
we
ought
to
be
shameless
before
all
men
and
to
do
what
we
ought
not
but
all
that
we
refrain
from
and
all
that
we
do
let
us
not
do
or
refrain
from
merely
because
it
seems
to
the
multitude
somehow
honourable
or
base
but
because
it
is
forbidden
by
reason
and
the
god
within
us
that
is
the
mind
as
for
the
multitude
there
is
no
reason
why
they
should
not
follow
common
opinions
for
that
is
better
than
that
they
should
be
altogether
shameless
and
indeed
mankind
is
predisposed
to
the
truth
by
nature
but
a
man
who
has
attained
to
a
life
in

with
intelligence
and
is
able
to
discover
and
estimate
right
reasons
ought
on
no
account
whatever
to
follow
the
views
held
by
the
many
about
good
and
bad
conduct

since
therefore
one
part
of
our
souls
is
more
divine
which
we
call
mind
and
intelligence
and
silent
reason
whose
herald
is
this
speech
of
ours
made
up
of
words
and
phrases
and
uttered
through
the
voice
and
since
there
is
yoked
therewith
another
part
of
the
soul
which
is
changeful
and
multiform
something
composite
of
anger
and
appetite
a
monster
we
ought
not
to
look
steadily
and
unswervingly
at
the
opinions
of
the
multitude
until
we
have
tamed
this
wild
beast
and
persuaded
it
to
obey
the
god
within
us
or
rather
the
divine
part
for
this
it
is
that
many
disciples
of
diogenes
have
ignored
and
hence
have
become
rapacious
and
depraved
and
no
better
than
any
one
of
the
brute
beasts
and
to
prove
that
this
is
not
my
own
theory
first
i
will
relate
to
you
something
that
diogenes
did
which
the
many
will
ridicule
but
to
me
it
seems
most
dignified
once
when
in
a
crowd
of
people
among
whom
was
diogenes
a
certain
youth
made
an
unseemly
noise
diogenes
struck
him
with
his
staff
and
said
and
so
vile
wretch
though
you
have
done
nothing
that
would
give
you
the
right
to
take
such
liberties
in
public
you
are
beginning
here
and
before
us
to
show
your
scorn
of
opinion
so
convinced
was
he
that
a
man
ought
to
subdue
pleasure
and
passion
before
he
proceeds
to
the
final
encounter
of
all
and
strips
to
wrestle
with
those
opinions
which
to
the
multitude
are
the
cause
of
evils
innumerable

do
you
not
know
how
people
lure
away
the
young
from
philosophy
by
continually
uttering
now
one
slander
and
then
another
against
all
the
philosophers
in
turn
the
genuine
disciples
of
pythagoras
and
plato
and
aristotle
are
called
sorcerers
and
sophists
and
conceited
and
quacks
if
here
and
there
among
the
cynics
one
is
really
virtuous
he
is
regarded
with
pity
for
instance
i
remember
that
once
my
tutor
said
to
me
when
he
saw
my
iphicles
with
his
hair
unkempt
and
his
clothes
in
tatters
on
his
chest
and
wearing
a
wretched
cloak
in
severe
winter
weather
what
evil
genius
can
have
plunged
him
into
this
sad
state
which
makes
not
only
him
pitiable
but
even
more
so
his
parents
who
reared
him
with
care
and
gave
him
the
best
education
they
could
and
now
he
goes
about
in
this
condition
neglecting
everything
and
no
better
than
a
beggar
at
the
time
i
answered
him
with
some
pleasantry
or
other
but
i
assure
you
that
the
multitude
hold
these
views
about
genuine
cynics
also
and
that
is
not
so
dreadful
but
do
you
see
that
they
persuade
them
to
love
wealth
to
hate
poverty
to
minister
to
the
belly
to
endure
any
toil
for
the
body
s
sake
to
fatten
that
prison
of
the
soul
to
keep
up
an
expensive
table
never
to
sleep
alone
at
night
provided
only
that
they
do
all
this
in
the
dark
and
are
not
found
out
is
not
this
worse
than
tartarus
is
it
not
better
to
sink
beneath
charybdis
and
cocytus
or
ten
thousand
fathoms
deep
in
the
earth
than
to
fall
into
a
life
like
this
enslaved
to
lust
and
appetite
and
not
even
to
these
simply
and
openly
like
the
beasts
but
to
take
pains
so
that
when
we
act
thus
we
may
be
hidden
under
cover
of
darkness
and
yet
much
better
is
it
to
refrain
altogether
from
all
this
and
if
that
be
difficult
the
rules
of
diogenes
and
crates
on
these
matters
are
not
to
be
despised
fasting
quenches
desire
and
if
you
can
not
fast
hang
do
you
not
know
that
those
great
men
lived
as
they
did
in
order
to
introduce
among
men
the
way
of
plain
living
for
says
diogenes
it
is
not
among
men
who
live
on
bread
that
you
will
find
tyrants
but
among
those
who
eat
costly
moreover
crates

then
let
not
the
cynic
be
like
oenomaus
shameless
or
impudent
or
a
scorner
of
everything
human
and
divine
but
reverent
towards
sacred
things
like
diogenes
for
he
obeyed
the
pythian
oracle
nor
did
he
repent
of
his
obedience
but
if
anyone
supposes
that
because
he
did
not
visit
the
temples
or
worship
statues
or
altars
this
is
a
sign
of
impiety
he
does
not
think
rightly
for
diogenes
possessed
nothing
that
is
usually
offered
incense
or
libations
or
money
to
buy
them
with
but
if
he
held
right
opinions
about
the
gods
that
in
itself
was
enough
for
he
worshipped
them
with
his
whole
soul
thus
offering
them
as
i
think
the
most
precious
of
his
possessions
the
dedication
of
his
soul
through
his
thoughts
let
not
the
cynic
be
shameless
but
led
by
reason
let
him
first
make
subservient
to
himself
the
emotional
part
of
his
soul
so
that
he
may
entirely
do
away
with
it
and
not
even
be
aware
that
he
is
superior
to
pleasures
for
it
is
nobler
to
attain
to
this
i
mean
to
complete
ignorance
whether
one
has
any
such
emotions
and
this
comes
to
us
only
through
training
and
that
none
may
think

this

but
let
me
go
back
to
what
i
said
before
that
he
who
is
entering
on
the
career
of
a
cynic
ought
first
censure
severely
and
himself
and
without
any
ask
himself
the
following
questions
in
precise
terms
whether
he
enjoys
expensive
food
whether
he
can
not
do
without
a
soft
bed
whether
he
is
the
slave
of
rewards
and
the
opinion
of
men
whether
it
is
his
ambition
to
attract
public
notice
and
even
though
that
be
an
empty
honour
he
still
thinks
it
worth
while
nevertheless
he
must
not
let
himself
drift
with
the
current
of
the
mob
or
touch
vulgar
pleasure
even
with
the
tip
of
his
finger
as
the
saying
is
until
he
has
succeeded
in
trampling
on
it
then
and
not
before
he
may
permit
himself
to
dip
into
that
sort
of
thing
if
it
come
his
way
for
instance
i
am
told
that
bulls
which
are
weaker
than
the
rest
separate
themselves
from
the
herd
and
pasture
alone
while
they
store
up
their
strength
in
every
part
of
their
bodies
by
degrees
until
they
rejoin
the
herd
in
good
condition
and
then
they
challenge
its
leaders
to
contend
with
them
in
confidence
that
they
are
more
fit
to
take
the
lead
therefore
let
him
who
wishes
to
be
a
cynic
philosopher
not
adopt
merely
their
long
cloak
or
wallet
or
staff
or
their
way
of
wearing
the
hair
as
though
he
were
like
a
man
walking
unshaved
and
illiterate
in
a
village
that
lacked
barbers
shops
and
schools
but
let
him
consider
that
reason
rather
than
a
staff
and
a
certain
plan
of
life
rather
than
a
wallet
are
the
mintmarks
of
the
cynic
philosophy
and
freedom
of
speech
he
must
not
employ
until
he
have
first
proved
how
much
he
is
worth
as
i
believe
was
the
case
with
crates
and
diogenes
for
they
were
so
far
from
bearing
with
a
bad
grace
any
threat
of
fortune
whether
one
call
such
threats
caprice
or
wanton
insult
that
once
when
he
had
been
captured
by
pirates
diogenes
joked
with
them
as
for
crates
he
gave
his
property
to
the
state
and
being
physically
deformed
he
made
fun
of
his
own
lame
leg
and
hunched
shoulders
but
when
his
friends
gave
an
entertainment
he
used
to
go
whether
invited
or
not
and
would
reconcile
his
nearest
friends
if
he
learned
that
they
had
quarrelled
he
used
to
reprove
them
not
harshly
but
with
a
charming
manner
and
not
so
as
to
seem
to
persecute
those
whom
he
wished
to
reform
but
as
though
he
wished
to
be
of
use
both
to
them
and
to
the
bystanders
καὶ

yet
this
was
not
the
chief
end
and
aim
of
those
cynics
but
as
i
said
their
main
concern
was
how
they
might
themselves
attain
to
happiness
and
as
i
think
they
occupied
themselves
with
other
men
only
in
so
far
as
they
comprehended
that
man
is
by
nature
a
social
and
political
animal
and
so
they
aided
their
not
only
by
practising
but
by
preaching
as
well
then
let
him
who
wishes
to
be
a
cynic
earnest
and
sincere
first
take
himself
in
hand
like
diogenes
and
crates
and
expel
from
his
own
soul
and
from
every
part
of
it
all
passions
and
desires
and
entrust
all
his
affairs
to
reason
and
intelligence
and
steer
his
course
by
them
for
this
in
my
opinion
was
the
sum
and
substance
of
the
philosophy
of
diogenes

and
if
diogenes
did
sometimes
visit
a
even
this
happened
only
once
perhaps
or
not
even
him
who
would
be
a
cynic
first
satisfy
us
that
he
is
like
diogenes
a
man
of
solid
worth
and
then
if
he
see
fit
to
do
that
sort
of
thing
openly
and
in
the
sight
of
all
men
we
shall
not
reproach
him
with
it
or
accuse
him
first
however
we
must
see
him
display
the
ability
to
learn
and
the
quick
wit
of
diogenes
and
in
all
other
relations
he
must
show
the
same
independence
justice
moderation
piety
gratitude
and
the
same
extreme
carefulness
not
to
act
at
random
or
without
a
purpose
or
irrationally
for
these
too
are
characteristic
of
the
philosophy
of
diogenes
then
let
him
trample
on
vaingloriousness
let
him
ridicule
those
who
though
they
conceal
in
darkness
the
necessary
functions
of
our
instance
the
secretion
of
what
is
in
the
centre
of
the
and
of
our
cities
carry
on
practices
that
are
most
brutal
and
by
no
means
akin
to
our
nature
for
instance
robbery
of
money
false
accusations
unjust
indictments
and
the
pursuit
of
other
rascally
business
of
the
same
sort
on
the
other
hand
when
diogenes
made
unseemly
noises
or
obeyed
the
call
of
nature
or
did
anything
else
of
that
sort
in
the
as
they
say
he
did
he
did
so
because
he
was
trying
to
trample
on
the
conceit
of
the
men
i
have
just
mentioned
and
to
teach
them
that
their
practices
were
far
more
sordid
and
insupportable
than
his
own
for
what
he
did
was
in
accordance
with
the
nature
of
all
of
us
but
theirs
accorded
with
no
man

real
nature
one
may
say
but
were
all
due

depravity

in
our
own
day
however
the
imitators
of
diogenes
have
chosen
only
what
is
easiest
and
least
burdensome
and
have
failed
to
see
his
nobler
side
and
as
for
you
in
your
desire
to
be
more
dignified
than
those
early
cynics
you
have
strayed
so
far
from
diogenes
plan
of
life
that
you
thought
him
an
object
of
pity
but
if
you
did
not
believe
all
this
that
i
say
about
a
man
whom
all
the
greeks
in
the
generation
of
plato
and
aristotle
admired
next
to
socrates
and
pythagoras
a
man
whose
pupil
was
the
teacher
of
the
most
modest
and
most
wise
zeno
it
is
not
likely
that
they
were
all
deceived
about
a
man
as
contemptible
as
you
make
him
out
to
be
in
your
travesty
in
that
case
my
dear
sir
perhaps
you
might
have
studied
his
character
more
carefully
and
you
would
have
progressed
further
in
your
knowledge
of
the
man
was
there
i
ask
a
single
greek
who
was
not
amazed
by
the
endurance
of
diogenes
and
by
his
perseverance
which
had
in
it
a
truly
royal
greatness
of
soul
the
man
used
to
sleep
in
his
jar
on
a
bed
of
leaves
more
soundly
than
the
great
king
on
his
soft
couch
under
a
gilded
roof
he
used
to
eat
his
crust
with
a
better
appetite
than
you
now
eat
your
sicilian
courses
he
used
to
bathe
his
body
in
cold
water
and
dry
himself
in
the
open
air
instead
of
with
the
linen
towels
with
which
you
rub
yourself
down
my
most
philosophic
friend
it
becomes
you
well
to
ridicule
him
because
i
suppose
like
themistocles
you
conquered
xerxes
or
darius
like
alexander
of
macedon
but
if
you
had
the
least
habit
of
reading
books
as
i
do
though
i
am
a
statesman
and
engrossed
in
public
affairs
you
would
know
how
much
alexander
is
said
to
have
admired
diogenes
greatness
of
soul
but
you
care
little
i
suppose
for
any
of
these
things
how
should
you
care
far
from
it
you
admire
and
emulate
the
life
of
wretched
women

oration
vii
introduction
to
oration
vii
the
seventh
oration
is
directed
against
the
cynic
heracleios
who
had
ventured
to
recite
before
an
audience
when
julian
was
present
a
myth
or
allegory
in
which
the
gods
were
irreverently
handled
julian
raises
the
question
whether
fables
and
myths
are
suitable
for
a
cynic
discourse
he
names
the
regular
divisions
of
philosophy
and
decides
that
the
use
of
myths
may
properly
be
allowed
only
to
ethical
philosophers
and
writers
on
theology
that
myth
is
intended
always
as
a
means
of
religious
teaching
and
should
be
addressed
to
children
and
those
whose
intellect
does
not
allow
them
to
envisage
the
truth
without
some
such
assistance
in
sallust
s
treatise
the
gods
and
the
he
gives
much
the
same
account
of
the
proper
function
of
myths
and
divides
them
into
five
species
giving
examples
of
each
to
wish
to
teach
the
whole
truth
about
the
gods
to
all
produces
contempt
in
the
foolish
because
they
can
not
understand
and
lack
of
zeal
in
the
good
whereas
to
conceal
the
truth
by
myths
prevents
the
contempt
of
the
foolish
and
compels
the
good
to
practise
this
is
precisely
the
opinion
of
julian
as
expressed
in
the
fifth
sixth
and
seventh
orations
though
both
julian
and
sallust
explain
the
myths
away
they
are
never
rationalistic
and
never
offer
the
least
excuse
for
scepticism
julian
s
explanation
of
the
semele
myth
which
makes
semele
an
inspired
prophetess
and
not
the
mother
of
dionysus
tends
to
the
greater
glory
of
the
god
the
conclusion
is
that
heracleios
should
not
have
used
myth
at
all
but
in
any
case
he
used
the
wrong
sort
and
wrote
in
the
wrong
spirit
he
should
have
used
such
a
myth
as
that
composed
by
prodicus
the
sophist
on
the
choice
of
heracles
at
the
crossroads
an
allegory
which
is
more
than
once
cited
by
julian
and
was
a
favourite
illustration
in
later
greek
literature
to
show
heraclius
what
he
might
have
written
with
propriety
julian
adds
a
parable
of
his
own
modelled
on
that
of
prodicus
in
this
he
himself
plays
the
part
of
a
second
heracles
and
takes
the
opportunity
to
vilify
constantius
and
point
out
his
own
mission
of
reformer
and
restorer
of
order
and
religion
to
the
empire
throughout
the
parable
there
are
striking
resemblances
with
the
first
oration
of
dio
chrysostom
and
asmus
has
made
a
detailed
comparison
of
the
two
writers
to
prove
that
julian
wrote
with
dio
before
him
in
many
of
these
parallels
both
julian
and
dio
can
be
traced
to
a
common
classical
source
usually
plato
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
julian
was
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
work
of
dio
and
often
used
the
same
illustrations
themistius
however
uses
the
prodicus
myth
in
much
the
same
words
as
dio
and
it
is
imitated
also
by
maximus
of
tyre
in
conclusion
julian
praises
the
earlier
cynics
and
criticises
the
later
in
much
the
same
words
as
he
had
used
in
the
sixth
oration
ιουλιανου
αυτοκρατορος
julian
emperor
προς

truly
with
the
lapse
of
time
many
things
come
to
pass
this
verse
i
have
heard
in
a
comedy
and
the
other
day
i
was
tempted
to
proclaim
it
aloud
when
by
invitation
we
attended
the
lecture
of
a
cynic
whose
barking
was
neither
distinct
nor
noble
but
he
was
crooning
myths
as
nurses
do
and
even
these
he
did
not
compose
in
any
profitable
fashion
for
a
moment
my
impulse
was
to
rise
and
break
up
the
meeting
but
though
i
had
to
listen
as
one
does
when
heracles
and
dionysus
are
being
caricatured
in
the
theatre
by
comic
poets
i
bore
it
to
the
end
not
for
the
speaker
s
sake
but
for
the
sake
of
the
audience
or
rather
if
i
may
presume
to
say
so
it
was
still
more
for
my
own
sake
so
that
i
might
not
seem
to
be
moved
by
superstition
rather
than
by
a
pious
and
rational
sentiment
and
to
be
scared
into
flight
by
his
miserable
words
like
a
timid
dove
so
i
stayed
and
repeated
to
myself
the
famous

for
the
brief
fraction
of
a
day
even
a
babbling
cynic
it
is
not
the
first
time
that
thou
hast
had
to
hear
the
gods
blasphemed
our
state
is
not
so
well
governed
our
private
life
is
not
so
virtuous
in
a
word
we
are
not
so
favoured
by
fortune
that
we
can
keep
our
ears
pure
or
at
any
rate
our
eyes
at
least
undefiled
by
the
many
and
various
impieties
of
this
iron
race
and
now
as
though
we
had
not
enough
of
such
vileness
this
cynic
fills
our
ears
with
his
blasphemies
and
has
uttered
the
name
of
the
highest
of
the
gods
in
such
wise
as
would
he
had
never
spoken
nor
i
heard
but
since
he
has
done
this
come
let
me
in
your
presence
try
to
teach
him
this
lesson
first
that
it
is
more
becoming
for
a
cynic
to
write
discourses
than
myths
secondly
what
sort
of
adaptations
of
the
myths
he
ought
to
make
if
indeed
philosophy
really
needs
mythology
at
all
and
finally
i
shall
have
a
few
words
to
say
about
reverence
for
the
gods
for
it
is
with
this
aim
that
i
appear
before
you
i
who
have
no
talent
for
writing
and
who
have
hitherto
avoided
addressing
the
general
public
as
i
have
avoided
all
else
that
is
tedious
and
sophistical
but
perhaps
it
is
not
unsuitable
for
me
to
say
and
for
you
to
hear
a
few
words
about
myth
in
general
as
a
sort
of
genealogy
of
that
kind
of
writing

now
one
could
no
more
discover
where
myth
was
originally
invented
and
who
was
the
first
to
compose
fiction
in
a
plausible
manner
for
the
benefit
or
entertainment
of
his
hearers
than
if
one
were
to
try
to
find
out
who
was
the
first
man
that
sneezed
or
the
first
horse
that
neighed
but
as
cavalry
arose
in
thrace
and
thessaly
and
archers
and
the
lighter
sort
of
weapons
in
india
crete
and
the
customs
of
the
people
were
i
suppose
adapted
to
the
nature
of
the
country
so
we
may
assume
about
other
things
as
well
that
where
anything
is
highly
prized
by
a
nation
it
was
first
discovered
by
that
nation
rather
than
by
any
other
on
this
assumption
then
it
seems
likely
that
myth
was
originally
the
invention
of
men
given
to
pastoral
pursuits
and
from
that
day
to
this
the
making
of
myths
is
still
peculiarly
cultivated
by
them
just
as
they
first
invented
instruments
of
music
the
flute
and
the
lyre
for
their
pleasure
and
entertainment
for
just
as
it
is
the
nature
of
birds
to
fly
and
of
fish
to
swim
and
of
stags
to
run
and
hence
they
need
not
be
taught
to
do
so
and
even
if
one
bind
or
imprison
these
animals
they
try
none
the
less
to
use
those
special
parts
of
themselves
for
the
purpose
for
which
they
know
they
are
naturally
adapted
even
so
i
think
the
human
race
whose
soul
is
no
other
than
reason
and
knowledge
imprisoned
so
to
speak
in
the
philosophers
call
it
a
so
i
say
the
human
race
inclines
to
learning
research
and
study
as
of
all
tasks
most
congenial
to
it
and
when
a
kindly
god
without
delay
looses
a
man
s
fetters
and
brings
that
potentiality
into
activity
then
on
the
instant
knowledge
is
his
whereas
in
those
who
are
still
imprisoned
false
opinion
instead
of
true
is
implanted
just
as
i
think
ixion
is
said
to
have
embraced
a
sort
of
cloud
instead
of
the
goddess
and
hence
they
produce
and
monstrous
births
mere
phantoms
and
shadows
so
to
speak
of
true
science
and
thus
instead
of
genuine
science
they
profess
false
doctrines
and
are
very
zealous
in
learning
and
teaching
such
doctrines
as
though
forsooth
they
were
something
useful
and
admirable
but
if
i
am
bound
to
say
something
in
defence
of
those
who
originally
invented
myths
i
think
they
wrote
them
for
childish
souls
and
i
liken
them
to
nurses
who
hand
toys
to
the
hands
of
children
when
they
are
irritated
by
teething
in
order
to
ease
their
suffering
so
those
mythologists
wrote
for
the
feeble
soul
whose
wings
are
just
beginning
to
sprout
and
who
though
still
incapable
of
being
taught
the
truth
is
yearning
for
further
knowledge
and
they
poured
in
a
stream
of
myths
like
men
who
water
a
thirsty
field
so
as
to
soothe
their
irritation
and
pangs

then
when
the
myth
was
gaining
ground
and
coming
into
favour
in
greece
poets
developed
from
it
the
fable
with
a
moral
which
differs
from
the
myth
in
that
the
latter
is
addressed
to
children
and
the
former
to
men
and
is
designed
not
merely
to
entertain
them
but
conveys
moral
exhortation
besides
for
the
man
who
employs
fable
aims
at
moral
exhortation
and
instruction
though
he
conceals
his
aim
and
takes
care
not
to
speak
openly
for
fear
of
alienating
his
hearers
hesiod
for
instance
seems
to
have
written
with
this
in
view
and
after
him
archilochus
often
employed
myths
adorning
and
as
it
were
seasoning
his
poetry
with
them
probably
because
he
saw
that
his
subject
matter
needed
something
of
this
sort
to
make
it
attractive
and
he
well
knew
that
poetry
without
myth
is
merely
versification
and
lacks
one
may
say
its
essential
characteristic
and
so
ceases
to
be
poetry
at
all
therefore
he

but
the
homer
of
myths
or
their
thucydides
or
plato
or
whatever
we
must
call
him
was
aesop
of
samos
who
was
a
slave
by
the
accident
of
birth
rather
than
by
temperament
and
he
proved
his
sagacity
by
this
very
use
of
fable
for
since
the
law
did
not
allow
him
freedom
of
speech
he
had
no
resource
but
to
shadow
forth
his
wise
counsels
and
trick
them
out
with
charms
and
graces
and
so
serve
them
up
to
his
hearers
just
so
i
think
physicians
who
are
men
prescribe
what
is
necessary
but
when
a
man
happens
to
be
a
slave
by
birth
and
a
physician
by
profession
he
is
forced
to
take
pains
to
flatter
and
cure
his
master
at
the
same
time
now
if
our
cynic
also
is
subject
to
this
sort
of
slavery
let
him
recite
myths
let
him
write
them
and
let
everyone
else
under
the
sun
leave
to
him
the
of
mythologist
but
since
he
asserts
that
he
alone
is
free
i
do
not
know
what
need
he
has
of
myths
does
he
need
to
temper
the
harshness
and
severity
of
his
advice
with
sweetness
and
charm
so
that
he
may
at
once
benefit
mankind
and
avoid
being
harmed
by
one
whom
he
has
benefited
nay
that
is
too
much
like
a
slave
moreover
would
any
man
be
better
taught
by
not
hearing
facts
as
they
really
are
or
called
by
their
real
names
like
the
comic
poet
who
calls
a
spade
a
spade
what
need
to
speak
of
phaethon
instead
of
what
need
sacrilegiously
to
profane
the
title
of
king
helios
who
among
men
that
walk
here
below
is
worthy
to
be
called
pan
or
zeus
as
though
we
should
ascribe
to
those
gods
our
human
understanding
and
yet
if
indeed
this
were
possible
it
would
have
been
better
to
give
the
men
their
own
names
would
it
not
have
been
better
to
speak
of
them
thus
and
to
bestow
on
them
human
names
or
rather
not
bestow
for
those
that
our
parents
gave
us
were
enough
well
then
if
it
is
neither
easier
to
learn
by
means
of
fiction
nor
appropriate
for
the
cynic
to
invent
that
sort
of
thing
at
all
why
did
we
not
spare
that
wasteful
expense
and
moreover
why
did
we
waste
our
time
in
inventing
and
composing
trivial
myths
and
then
making
stories
of
them
and
learning
them
by
heart

but
perhaps
you
will
say
that
though
reason
asserts
that
the
cynic
who
alone
of
men
can
claim
to
be
free
ought
not
to
invent
and
compose
lying
fictions
instead
of
the
unvarnished
truth
and
then
recite
these
in
public
assemblies
nevertheless
the
custom
began
with
diogenes
and
crates
and
has
been
maintained
from
that
time
by
all
cynics
my
answer
is
that
nowhere
will
you
find
a
single
example
of
such
a
custom
for
the
moment
i
do
not
insist
on
the
fact
that
it
in
no
wise
becomes
a
cynic
who
must
give
a
new
stamp
to
the
common
currency
to
pay
any
attention
to
custom
but
only
to
pure
reason
and
he
ought
to
discover
within
himself
what
is
right
for
him
to
do
and
not
learn
it
from
without
and
do
not
be
misled
by
the
fact
that
antisthenes
the
disciple
of
socrates
and
xenophon
too
sometimes
expressed
themselves
by
means
of
myths
for
i
shall
have
something
to
say
to
you
on
this
point
in
a
moment
but
now
in
the
muses
name
answer
me
this
question
about
the
cynic
philosophy
are
we
to
think
it
a
sort
of
madness
a
method
of
life
not
suitable
for
a
human
being
but
rather
a
brutal
attitude
of
mind
which
recks
naught
of
the
beautiful
the
honourable
or
the
good
for
oenomaus
would
make
many
people
hold
this
view
of
it
if
you
had
taken
any
trouble
to
study
the
subject
you
would
have
learned
this
from
that
cynic
s
direct
inspiration
of
oracles
and
his
work
against
the
oracles
in
short
from
everything
that
he
wrote
this
then
is
his
aim
to
do
away
with
all
reverence
for
the
gods
to
bring
dishonour
on
all
human
wisdom
to
trample
on
all
law
that
can
be
identified
with
honour
and
justice
and
more
than
this
to
trample
on
those
laws
which
have
been
as
it
were
engraved
on
our
souls
by
the
gods
and
have
impelled
us
all
to
believe
without
teaching
that
the
divine
exists
and
to
direct
our
eyes
to
it
and
to
yearn
towards
it
for
our
souls
are
disposed
towards
it
as
eyes
towards
the
light
furthermore
suppose
that
one
should
discard
also
that
second
law
which
is
sanctified
both
by
nature
and
by
god
i
mean
the
law
that
bids
us
keep
our
hands
altogether
and
utterly
from
the
property
of
others
and
permits
us
neither
by
word
or
deed
or
in
the
inmost
and
secret
activities
of
our
souls
to
confound
such
distinctions
since
the
law
is
our
guide
to
the
most
perfect
not
this
conduct
worthy
of
pit
and
ought
not
those
who
applauded
such
views
to
have
been
driven
forth
not
by
blows
with
wands
like
scapegoats
for
that
penalty
is
too
light
for
such
crimes
but
put
to
death
by
stoning
for
tell
me
in
heaven
s
name
how
are
such
men
less
criminal
than
bandits
who
infest
lonely
places
and
haunt
the
coasts
in
order
to
despoil
navigators
because
as
people
say
they
despise
death
as
though
bandits
were
not
inspired
by
the
same
frenzied
courage
so
says
at
any
rate
he
who
with
you
counts
as
a
poet
and
mythologist
though
as
a
pythian
god
proclaimed
to
certain
bandits

sought

was

now
as
for
the
tragedies
ascribed
to
diogenes
which
are
and
are
admitted
to
be
the
composition
of
some
only
point
in
dispute
being
whether
they
are
by
the
master
himself
diogenes
or
by
his
disciple
philiscus
reader
of
these
would
not
abhor
them
and
find
in
them
an
excess
of
infamy
not
to
be
surpassed
even
by
courtesans
however
let
him
go
on
to
read
the
tragedies
of
he
too
wrote
tragedies
to
match
his
he
will
find
that
they
are
more
inconceivably
infamous
that
they
transgress
the
very
limits
of
evil
in
fact
i
have
no
words
to
describe
them
adequately
and
in
vain
should
i
cite
in
comparison
the
horrors
of
magnesia
the
wickedness
of
termerus
or
the
whole
of
tragedy
put
together
along
with
satiric
drama
comedy
and
the
mime
with
such
art
has
their
author
displayed
in
those
works
every
conceivable
vileness
and
folly
in
their
most
extreme
form
now
if
from
such
works
any
man
chooses
to
demonstrate
to
us
the
character
of
the
cynic
philosophy
and
to
blaspheme
the
gods
and
bark
at
all
men
as
i
said
when
i
began
let
him
go
let
him
depart
to
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
whithersoever
he
pleases
but
if
he
do
as
the
god
enjoined
on
diogenes
and
first
give
a
new
stamp
to
the
common
currency
then
devote
himself
to
the
advice
uttered
earlier
by
the
god
the
precept
know
thyself
which
diogenes
and
crates
evidently
followed
in
their
actual
practice
then
i
say
that
this
is
wholly
worthy
of
one
who
desires
to
be
a
leader
and
a
philosopher
for
surely
we
know
what
the
god
meant
he
enjoined
on
diogenes
to
despise
the
opinion
of
the
crowd
and
to
give
a
new
stamp
not
to
truth
but
to
the
common
currency
now
to
which
of
these
categories
shall
we
assign
knowledge
can
we
call
it
common
currency
shall
we
not
rather
say
that
it
is
the
very
summary
of
truth
and
by
the
injunction
know
thyself
we
are
told
the
way
in
which
we
must
give
a
new
stamp
to
the
common
currency
for
just
as
one
who
pays
no
regard
whatever
to
conventional
opinions
but
goes
straight
for
the
truth
will
not
decide
his
own
conduct
by
those
opinions
but
by
actual
facts
so
i
think
he
who
knows
himself
will
know
accurately
not
the
opinion
of
others
about
him
but
what
he
is
in
reality
it
follows
then
does
it
not
that
the
pythian
god
speaks
the
truth
and
moreover
that
diogenes
was
clearly
convinced
of
this
since
he
obeyed
the
god
and
so
became
instead
of
an
exile
i
will
not
say
greater
than
the
king
of
persia
but
according
to
the
tradition
handed
down
actually
an
object
of
envy
to
the
man
who
had
broken
the
power
of
persia
and
was
rivalling
the
exploits
of
heracles
and
ambitious
to
surpass
achilles
then
let
us
judge
of
the
attitude
of
diogenes
towards
gods
and
men
not
from
the
discourses
of
oenomaus
or
the
tragedies
of
by
ascribing
their
authorship
to
diogenes
grossly
slandered
that
sacred
let
us
i
say
judge
him
by
his
deeds

why
in
the
name
of
zeus
did
he
go
to
olympia
to
see
the
athletes
compete
nay
could
he
not
have
seen
those
very
athletes
without
trouble
both
at
the
isthmian
games
and
the
panathenaic
festival
then
was
it
because
he
wished
to
meet
there
the
most
distinguished
greeks
but
did
they
not
go
to
the
isthmus
too
so
you
can
not

any

motive
than
that
of
doing
honour
to
the
god
he
was
not
you

awestruck

i

for

i

he
bade
alexander
come
to
him
if
we
are
to
believe
dio
so
convinced
was
he
that
it
was
his
duty
to
visit
the
temples
of
the
gods
but
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
most
royal
monarch
of
that
day
to
come
to
him
for
an
interview
and
was
not
that
royal
advice
which
he
wrote
to
archidamus
nay
not
only
in
words
but
in
deeds
also
did
diogenes
show
his
reverence
for
the
gods
for
he
preferred
to
live
in
athens
but
when
the
divine
command
had
sent
him
away
to
corinth
even
after
he
had
been
set
free
by
the
man
who
had
bought
him
he
did
not
think
he
ought
to
leave
that
city
for
he
believed
that
the
gods
took
care
of
him
and
that
he
had
been
sent
to
corinth
not
at
random
or
by
some
accident
but
by
the
gods
themselves
for
some
purpose
he
saw
that
corinth
was
more
luxurious
than
athens
and
stood
in
need
of
a
more
severe
and
courageous
reformer

are
you
not
aware

all

great

that
are
brought
to
the
gods
with
piety
have
equal
value

without
piety
i
will
not

hecatombs

by
the
gods
even
the
olympian
sacrifice
of
a
thousand
oxen
is
merely
empty
expenditure
and
nothing

this
i
believe
crates
recognized
and
so
with
that
piety
which
was
his
only
possession
he
himself
used
to
honour
the
gods
with
praises
and
moreover
taught
others
not
to
honour
expensive
offerings
more
than
piety
in
the
sacred
ceremonies

then
was
the
attitude
of
both
those
cynics

the

they
did
not

audiences

hear
them

by
living
in
the
open
market
places
and
the
temple
precincts
and
they
opposed
luxury
by
their
own
practice
before
they
did
so
in
words
nor
did
they
shout
aloud
but
proved
by
their
actions
that
a
man
may
rule
as
the
equal
of
zeus
if
he
needs
nothing
or
very
little
and
so
is
not
hampered
by
his
body
and
they
reproved
sinners
during
the
lifetime
of
those
who
had
offended
but
did
not
speak
ill
of
the
dead
for
when
men
are
dead
even
their
enemies
at
least
the
more
moderate
make
peace
with
the
departed
but
the
genuine
cynic
has
no
enemy
even
though
men
strike
his
feeble
body
or
drag
his
name
in
the
mire
or
slander
and
speak
ill
of
him
because
enmity
is
felt
only
towards
an
opponent
but
that
which
is
above
personal
rivalry
is
usually
loved
and
respected
but
if
anyone
is
hostile
to
a
cynic
as
indeed
many
are
even
to
the
gods
he
is
not
that
cynic
s
enemy
since
he
can
not
injure
him
rather
he
inflicts
on
himself
the
most
terrible
punishment
of
all
namely
ignorance
of
one
who
is
nobler
than
himself
and
so
he
is
deserted
and
bereft
of
the
other
s
protection

now
if
my
present
task
were
to
write
about
the
cynic
philosophy
i
could
add
many
details
about
the
cynics
not
less
important
than
what
i
have
said
already
but
not
to
interrupt
my
main
theme
i
will
now
consider
in
due
course
the
question
what
kind
of
myths
ought
to
be
invented
but
perhaps
another
inquiry
should
precede
this
attempt
i
mean
to
what
branch
of
philosophy
the
composition
of
myths
is
appropriate
for
we
see
that
many
philosophers
and
theologians
too
have
employed
it
orpheus
for
instance
the
most
ancient
of
all
the
inspired
philosophers
and
many
besides
of
those
that
came
after
him
nay
what
is
more
xenophon
as
we
know
and
antisthenes
and
plato
often
introduced
myths
so
that
it
is
obvious
that
even
if
the
use
of
myth
be
not
appropriate
for
the
cynic
still
it
may
be
so
for
some
other
type
of
philosopher

i
must
first
then
say
a
few
words
about
the
subdivisions
or
instruments
of
philosophy
it
does
not
make
much
difference
in
which
of
two
ways
one
reckons
logic
whether
with
practical
or
natural
philosophy
since
it
is
equally
necessary
to
both
these
branches
but
i
will
consider
these
as
three
separate
branches
and
assign
to
each
one
three
subdivisions
natural
philosophy
consists
of
theology
mathematics
and
thirdly
the
study
of
this
world
of
generation
and
decay
and
things
that
though
imperishable
are
nevertheless
matter
and
deals
with
their
essential
nature
and
their
substance
in
each
case
practical
philosophy
again
consists
of
ethics
in
so
far
as
it
deals
with
the
individual
man
economics
when
it
deals
with
the
household
as
a
unit
politics
when
it
deals
with
the
state
logic
again
is
demonstrative
in
so
far
as
it
deals
with
the
truth
of
principles
polemic
when
it
deals
with
general
opinions
eristic
when
it
deals
with
opinions
that
only
seem
probabilities
these
then
are
the
divisions
of
philosophy
if
i
mistake
not
though
indeed
it
would
not
be
surprising
that
a
mere
soldier
should
be
none
too
exact
in
these
matters
or
not
have
them
at
his
fingers
ends
seeing
that
i
speak
less
from
knowledge
than
from
observation
and
experience
for
that
matter
you
can
yourselves
bear
me
witness
thereto
if
you
count
up
how
few
days
have
elapsed
between
the
lecture
that
we
lately
heard
and
and
moreover
the
number
of
affairs
with
which
they
have
been
filled
for
me
but
as
i
said
if
i
have
omitted
i
do
not
think
i
if
anyone
can
make
my
classification
more
complete
he
will
be
no
enemy

now
of
these
branches
of
philosophy
logic
has
no
concern
with
the
composition
of
myths
nor
has
mathematics
the
of
natural
philosophy
but
they
may
be
employed
if
at
all
by
that
department
of
practical
philosophy
which
deals
with
the
individual
man
and
by
that
department
of
theology
which
has
to
do
with
initiation
and
the
mysteries
for
nature
loves
to
hide
her
secrets
and
she
does
not
suffer
the
hidden
truth
about
the
essential
nature
of
the
gods
to
be
flung
in
naked
words
to
the
ears
of
the
profane
now
there
are
certain
characteristics
of
ours
that
derive
benefit
from
that
occult
and
unknown
nature
which
nourishes
not
our
souls
alone
but
our
bodies
also
and
brings
us
into
the
presence
of
the
gods
and
this
i
think
often
comes
about
by
means
of
myths
when
through
riddles
and
the
dramatic
setting
of
myths
that
knowledge
is
insinuated
into
the
ears
of
the
multitude
who
can
not
receive
divine
truths

it
is
now
evident
what
branch
and
what
sort
of
philosophy
may
properly
on
occasion
employ
myths
and
to
support
my
argument
i
call
to
witness
the
authority
of
those
philosophers
who
were
the
first
to
use
myths
plato
for
instance
in
his
theological
descriptions
of
life
in
hades
often
uses
myths
and
the
son
of
calliope
before
him
and
when
antisthenes
and
xenophon
and
plato
himself
discuss
certain
ethical
theories
they
use
myths
as
one
of
the
ingredients
and
not
casually
but
of
set
purpose
now
if
you
too
wished
to
use
myths
you
ought
to
have
imitated
these
philosophers
and
instead
of
heracles
you
should
have
introduced
the
name
of
perseus
or
theseus
let
us
say
and
have
written
in
the
style
of
antisthenes
and
in
place
of
the
dramatic
setting
used
by
prodicus
in
treating
of
those
two
gods
you
should
have
introduced
into
your
theatre
another
setting
of
the
same
sort

but
since
i
have
mentioned
also
the
myths
that
are
suited
to
initiation
let
us
ourselves
independently
try
to
see
what
sort
of
myths
they
must
be
that
suit
one
or
the
other
of
those
two
branches
of
philosophy
and
no
longer
need
we
call
in
the
aid
of
witnesses
from
the
remote
past
for
all
points
but
we
will
follow
in
the
fresh
footprints
of
one
whom
next
to
the
gods
i
revere
and
admire
yes
equally
with
aristotle
and
plato
he
does
not
treat
of
all
kinds
of
myths
but
only
those
connected
with
initiation
into
the
mysteries
such
as
orpheus
the
founder
of
the
most
sacred
of
all
the
mysteries
handed
down
to
us
for
it
is
the
incongruous
element
in
myths
that
guides
us
to
the
truth
i
mean
that
the
more
paradoxical
and
prodigious
the
riddle
is
the
more
it
seems
to
warn
us
not
to
believe
simply
the
bare
words
but
rather
to
study
diligently
the
hidden
truth
and
not
to
relax
our
efforts
until
under
the
guidance
of
the
gods
those
hidden
things
become
plain
and
so
initiate
or
rather
perfect
our
intelligence
or
whatever
we
possess
that
is
more
sublime
than
the
intelligence
i
mean
that
small
particle
of
the
one
and
the
good
which
contains
the
whole
indivisibly
the
complement
of
the
soul
and
in
the
one
and
the
good
comprehends
the
whole
of
soul
itself
through
the
prevailing
and
separate
and
distinct
presence
of
the
one
but
i
was
impelled
i
know
not
how
to
rave
with
his
own
sacred
frenzy
when
i
spoke
like
this
of
the
attributes
of
great
dionysus
and
now
i
set
an
ox
on
my
tongue
for
i
may
not
reveal
what
is
too
sacred
for
speech
however
may
the
gods
grant
to
me
and
to
many
of
you
who
have
not
as
yet
been
initiated
into
these
mysteries
to
enjoy
the
blessings

εἴη
and
now
to
confine
myself
to
what
is
lawful
for
us
both
for
me
to
say
and
for
you
to
hear
every
discourse
that
is
uttered
consists
of
language
and
the
thought
to
be
expressed
now
a
myth
is
a
sort
of
discourse
and
so
it
will
consist
of
these
two
let
us
consider
them
separately
in
every
discourse
the
thought
is
of
two
kinds
either
simple
or
expressed
in
figures
of
speech
and
there
are
many
examples
of
both
kinds
the
one
is
simple
and
admits
of
no
variety
but
that
which
is
embellished
with
figures
has
in
itself
many
possibilities
of
variation
with
all
of
which
you
are
yourself
familiar
if
you
have
ever
studied
rhetoric
and
most
of
these
figures
of
thought
are
suited
to
myth
however
i
need
not
now
discuss
all
or
indeed
many
of
them
but
only
two
that
in
which
the
thought
is
dignified
and
that
in
which
it
is
paradoxical
the
same
rules
apply
also
to
diction
for
this
is
given
a
certain
shape
and
form
by
those
who
do
not
express
themselves
carelessly
or
sweep
in
the
refuse
of
language
from
the
highways
like
a
winter
torrent
and
now
to
consider
these
two
types
when
we
invent
myths
about
sacred
things
our
language
must
be
wholly
dignified
and
the
diction
must
be
as
far
as
possible
sober
beautiful
and
entirely
appropriate
to
the
gods
there
must
be
nothing
in
it
base
or
slanderous
or
impious
for
fear
we
should
lead
the
common
people
into
this
sort
of
sacrilegious
rashness
or
rather
for
fear
we
should
ourselves
anticipate
the
common
people
in
displaying
impiety
towards
the
gods
therefore
there
must
be
no
incongruous
element
in
diction
thus
employed
but
all
must
be
dignified
beautiful
splendid
divine
pure
and
as
far
as
possible
in
conformity
with
the
essential
nature
of
the
gods
but
as
regards
the
thought
the
incongruous
may
be
admitted
so
that
under
the
guidance
of
the
gods
men
may
be
inspired
to
search
out
and
study
the
hidden
meaning
though
they
must
not
ask
for
any
hint
of
the
truth
from
others
but
must
acquire
their
knowledge
from
what
is
said
in
the
myth
itself
for
instance
i
have
heard
many
people
say
that
dionysus
was
a
mortal
man
because
he
was
born
of
semele
and
that
he
became
a
god
through
his
knowledge
of
theurgy
and
the
mysteries
and
like
our
lord
heracles
for
his
royal
virtue
was
translated
to
olympus
by
his
father
zeus
nay
my
good
sir
said
i
do
you
not
perceive
that
the
myth
is
obviously
an
allegory
for
in
what
sense
do
we
regard
the
birth
of
heracles
yes
and
of
dionysus
as
well
since
in
their
case
birth
has
superior
and
surpassing
and
distinctive
elements
even
though
it
still
falls
within
the
limits
of
human
nature
and
up
to
a
certain
point
resembles
our
own
heracles
for
instance
is
said
to
have
been
a
child
even
as
we
are
his
divine
body
grew
gradually
we
are
informed
that
he
was
instructed
by
teachers
they
say
that
he
carried
on
wars
and
defeated
all
his
opponents
but
for
all
that
his
body
had
to
endure
weariness
and
in
fact
all
this
did
in
his
case
occur
but
on
a
scale
greater
than
human
for
instance
while
still
in
swaddling
clothes
he
strangled
the
serpents
and
then
opposed
himself
to
the
very
elements
of
nature
the
extremes
of
heat
and
cold
and
things
the
most
difficult
and
hardest
to
contend
with
i
mean
lack
of
food
and
loneliness
and
then
there
is
his
journey
over
the
sea
itself
in
a
golden
cup
though
by
the
gods
i
do
not
think
it
was
really
a
cup
but
my
belief
is
that
he
himself
walked
on
the
sea
as
though
it
were
dry
land
for
what
was
impossible
to
heracles
which
was
there
of
the
elements
that
did
not
obey
his
divine
and
most
pure
body
since
they
were
subdued
to
the
creative
and
perfecting
force
of
his
stainless
and
pure
intelligence
for
him
did
mighty
zeus
with
the
aid
of
athene
goddess
of
forethought
beget
to
be
the
saviour
of
the
world
and
appointed
as
his
guardian
this
goddess
whom
he
had
brought
forth
whole
from
the
whole
of
himself
and
later
on
he
called
him
to
his
side
through
the
flame
of
a
thunderbolt
thus
bidding
his
son
to
come
to
him
by
the
divine
signal
of
the
ethereal
rays
of
light
now
when
we
meditate
on
this
may
heracles
be
gracious
to
you
and
to
me

as
for
the
commonly
received
legend
about
the
birth
of
dionysus
which
was
in
fact
no
birth
but
a
divine
manifestation
in
what
respect
was
it
like
the
birth
of
men
while
he
was
still
in
his
mother
s
womb
she
as
the
story
goes
was
beguiled
by
jealous
hera
to
entreat
her
lover
to
visit
her
as
he
was
wont
to
visit
his
spouse
and
then
her
frail
body
could
not
endure
the
thunders
of
zeus
and
began
to
be
consumed
by
the
lightning
but
when
everything
there
was
being
devoured
by
flames
zeus
bade
hermes
snatch
dionysus
forth
and
he
cut
open
his
own
thigh
and
sewed
the
babe
therein
then
in
due
course
when
the
time
was
ripe
for
the
child
s
birth
zeus
in
the
pangs
of
travail
came
to
the
nymphs
and
they
by
their
song
over
the
thigh
undo
the
stitching
brought
to
light
for
us
the
dithyramb
whereupon
the
god
was
driven
mad
by
hera
but
the
mother
of
the
gods
healed
him
of
his
sickness
and
he
straightway
became
a
god
and
he
had
for
followers
not
like
heracles
lichas
for
instance
or
iolaus
or
telamon
or
hylas
or
abderos
but
satyrs
bacchanals
pans
and
a
whole
host
of
lesser
divinities
do
you
perceive
how
much
of
human
there
is
in
this
generation
through
the
fire
of
a
thunderbolt
that
his
delivery
is
even
more
human
and
that
his
deeds
even
more
than
these
two
that
we
have
mentioned
resemble
those
of
human
beings
now
why
do
we
not
set
aside
all
this
nonsense
and
recognise
herein
first
the
fact
that
semele
was
wise
in
sacred
things
for
she
was
the
daughter
of
phoenician
cadmus
and
the
god
himself
bears
witness
to
the
wisdom
of
the
phoenicians
when
he
says
πολλὰς
καὶ
φοίνικες
ὁδοὺς
μακάρων
ἐδάησαν
the
phoenicians
too
have
learned
many
of

think
then
that
she
was
the
first
among
the
greeks
to
perceive
that
there
was
to
be
before
long
a
visible
manifestation
of
this
god
and
that
she
foretold
it
and
then
that
sooner
than
was
fitting
she
gave
the
signal
for
certain
of
the
mystic
rites
connected
with
his
worship
because
she
had
not
the
patience
to
wait
for
the
appointed
time
and
thus
she
was
consumed
by
the
fire
that
fell
upon
her
but
when
it
was
the
will
of
zeus
to
bestow
on
all
mankind
in
common
a
new
order
of
things
and
to
make
them
pass
from
the
nomadic
to
a
more
civilised
mode
of
life
dionysus
came
from
india
and
revealed
himself
as
very
god
made
visible
visiting
the
cities
of
men
and
leading
with
him
a
great
host
of
beings
in
some
sort
divine
and
everywhere
he
bestowed
on
all
men
in
common
as
the
symbol
of
his
manifestation
the
plant
of
the
gentle
vine
and
since
their
lives
were
made
more
gentle
by
it
the
greeks
as
i
think
gave
it
that
name
and
they
called
semele
the
mother
of
dionysus
because
of
the
prediction
that
she
had
made
but
also
because
the
god
honoured
her
as
having
been
the
first
prophetess
of
his
advent
while
it
was
yet
to

discover
what
sort
of
god
dionysus
is
worked
into
a
myth
the
truth
which
is
as
i
said
and
expressed
in
an
allegory
both
the
essential
nature
of
the
god
and
his
conception
in
his
father
zeus
among
the
intelligible
gods
and
further
his
birth
independently
of
generation
in
this
our
world
in
the
whole
universe
and
in
their
proper
order
all
those
other
facts
which
are
well
worth
studying
but
too
difficult
for
me
at
any
rate
to
describe
partly
perhaps
because
i
am
still
ignorant
of
the
precise
truth
about
them
but
perhaps
also
because
i
am
unwilling
to
exhibit
as
in
a
theatre
this
god
who
is
at
once
hidden
and
manifest
and
that
too
to
ears
that
have
not
sought
after
truth
and
to
minds
disposed
to
anything
rather
than
the
study
of
philosophy

however
let
dionysus
himself
decide
about
these
things
though
i
do
indeed
implore
him
to
inspire
my
mind
and
yours
with
his
own
sacred
frenzy
for
the
true
knowledge
of
the
gods
so
that
we
may
not
by
remaining
too
long
uninspired
by
him
have
to
suffer
the
fate
of
pentheus
perhaps
even
while
we
are
alive
but
most
certainly
after
death
has
freed
us
from
the
body
for
he
in
whom
the
abundance
of
life
has
not
been
perfected
by
the
essential
nature
of
dionysus
uniform
and
wholly
indivisible
as
it
is
in
the
divisible
world
and
whole
and
unmixed
in
all
things
he
i
say
who
has
not
been
perfected
by
means
of
the
bacchic
and
divine
frenzy
for
the
god
runs
the
risk
that
his
life
may
flow
into
too
many
channels
and
as
it
flows
be
torn
to
shreds
and
hence
come
to
naught
but
when
i
say
flow
or
torn
to
shreds
no
one
must
consider
the
bare
meaning
of
the
words
and
suppose
that
i
mean
a
mere
trickle
of
water
or
a
thread
of
linen
but
he
must
understand
these
words
in
another
sense
that
used
by
plato
plotinus
porphyry
and
the
inspired
iamblichus
one
who
does
not
interpret
them
thus
will
laugh
at
them
no
doubt
but
let
me
assure
him
that
it
will
be
a
sardonic
laugh
since
he
will
be
forever
deprived
of
that
knowledge
of
the
gods
which
i
hold
to
be
more
precious
than
to
rule
over
the
whole
world
roman
and
barbarian
put
together
yea
i
swear
it
by
my
lord
helios
but
again
some
god
or
other
and
no
choice
of
my
own
has
made
me
rave
with
this
bacchic
frenzy

to
go
back
then
to
what
led
me
to
say
all
this
whenever
myths
on
sacred
subjects
are
incongruous
in
thought
by
that
very
fact
they
cry
aloud
as
it
were
and
summon
us
not
to
believe
them
literally
but
to
study
and
track
down
their
hidden
meaning
and
in
such
myths
the
incongruous
element
is
even
more
valuable
than
the
serious
and
straightforward
the
more
so
that
when
the
latter
is
used
there
is
risk
of
our
regarding
the
gods
as
exceedingly
great
and
noble
and
good
certainly
but
still
as
human
beings
whereas
when
the
meaning
is
expressed
incongruous
there
is
some
hope
that
men
will
neglect
the
more
obvious
sense
of
the
words
and
that
pure
intelligence
may
rise
to
the
comprehension
of
the
distinctive
nature
of
the
gods
that
transcends
all
existing
things

these
then
are
the
reasons
why
that
branch
of
philosophy
which
is
connected
with
initiation
and
the
doctrines
of
the
mysteries
ought
by
all
means
to
be
expressed
in
devout
and
serious
language
while
as
regards
the
thought
the
narrative
may
be
expounded
in
a
style
that
has
stranger
qualities
but
one
who
is
inventing
tales
for
the
purpose
of
reforming
morals
and
inserts
myths
therein
does
so
not
for
men
but
for
those
who
are
children
whether
in
years
or
intelligence
and
who
on
all
accounts
stand
in
need
of
such
tales
if
however
you
took
us
for
children
me
for
instance
or
anatolius
here
and
you
may
reckon
with
us
memmorius
also
and
sallust
and
add
if
you
please
all
the
others
in
due
order
then
you
need
a
voyage
to
anticyra
for
why
should
one
pretend
to
be
polite
tell
me
i
ask
in
the
name
of
the
gods
and
of
myth
itself
or
rather
in
the
name
of
helios
the
king
of
all
the
universe
what
have
you
ever
accomplished
great
or
small
when
did
you
ever
champion
one
who
was
resisting
oppression
and
had
right
on
his
side
when
did
you
ever
comfort
the
mourner
and
teach
him
by
your
arguments
that
death
is
not
an
evil
either
for
him
who
has
suffered
it
or
for
his
friends
what
youth
will
ever
give
you
the
credit
for
his
temperance
and
say
that
you
have
made
him
show
himself
sober
instead
of
dissolute
and
beautiful
not
merely
in
body
but
far
more
in
soul
what
strenuous
discipline
have
you
ever
embraced
what
have
you
ever
done
to
make
you
worthy
of
the
staff
of
diogenes
or
still
more
by
zeus
of
his
freedom
of
speech
do
you
really
think
it
so
great
an
achievement
to
carry
a
staff
and
let
your
hair
grow
and
haunt
cities
and
camps
uttering
calumnies
against
the
noblest
men
and
flattering
the
vilest
tell
me
in
the
name
of
zeus
and
of
this
audience
now
present
who
are
disgusted
with
philosophy
because
of
men
of
your
sort
why
was
it
that
you
visited
the
late
emperor
constantius
in
italy
but
could
not
travel
as
far
as
gaul
and
yet
if
you
had
come
to
me
you
would
at
any
rate
have
associated
with
one
who
was
better
able
to
comprehend
your
language
what
do
you
gain
by
travelling
about
in
all
directions
and
wearing
out
the
very
mules
you
ride
yes
and
i
hear
that
you
wear
out
the
mule
drivers
as
well
and
that
they
dread
the
sight
of
you
cynics
even
more
than
of
soldiers
for
i
am
told
that
some
of
you
belabour
them
more
cruelly
with
your
staffs
than
do
the
soldiers
with
their
swords
so
that
they
are
naturally
more
afraid
of
you
long
ago
i
gave
you
a
nickname
and
now
i
think
i
will
write
it
down
it
is
monks
a
name
applied
to
certain
persons
by
the
impious
galilaeans
they
are
for
the
most
part
men
who
by
making
small
sacrifices
gain
much
or
rather
everything
from
all
sources
and
in
addition
secure
honour
crowds
of
attendants
and
flattery
something
like
that
is
your
method
except
perhaps
for
uttering
divine
revelations
but
this
is
not
your
custom
though
it
is
ours
for
we
are
wiser
than
those
insensate
men
and
perhaps
too
there
is
this
difference
that
you
have
no
excuse
for
levying
tribute
on
specious
pretexts
as
they
do
which
they
call
alms
whatever
that
may
mean
but
in
all
other
respects
your
habits
and
theirs
are
very
much
alike
like
them
you
have
abandoned
your
country
you
wander
about
all
over
the
world
and
you
gave
more
trouble
than
they
did
at
my
headquarters
and
were
more
insolent
for
they
were
at
any
rate
invited
to
come
but
you
we
tried
to
drive
away
and
what
good
have
you
or
rather
what
have
the
rest
of
us
derived
from
all
this
first
arrived
asclepiades
then
serenianus
then
chytron
then
a
tall
boy
with
yellow
don
t
know
his
you
and
with
you
all
twice
as
many
more
and
now
my
good
sirs
what
good
has
come
from
your
journey
what
city
or
individual
has
had
any
experience
of
your
alleged
freedom
of
speech
was
it
not
foolish
of
you
to
choose
in
the
first
place
to
make
this
journey
to
an
emperor
who
did
not
even
wish
to
set
eyes
on
you
and
when
you
had
arrived
did
you
not
behave
even
more
foolishly
and
ignorantly
and
insanely
in
flattering
and
barking
at
me
in
the
same
breath
and
offering
me
your
books
and
moreover
imploring
that
they
should
be
taken
to
me
i
do
not
believe
that
any
one
of
you
ever
visited
a
philosopher
s

have
done
with

this
nonsense
at

lay
it

now
if

before
when
you
can
get
no
advantage
from
your

hair
and
your

shall
i
tell
you
how
you
have
caused
philosophy
to
be
lightly
esteemed
it
is
because
the
most
ignorant
of
the
rhetoricians
those
whose
tongues
not
king
hermes
himself
could
purify
and
who
could
not
be
made
wise
by
athene
herself
with
the
aid
of
hermes
having
picked
up
their
knowledge
from
their
industry
in
frequenting
public
places
they
do
not
know
the
truth
of
the
current
proverb
grape
ripens
near
grape
all
rush
into
cynicism
they
adopt
the
staff
the
cloak
the
long
hair
the
ignorance
that
goes
with
these
the
impudence
the
insolence
and
in
a
word
everything
of
the
sort
they
say
that
they
are
travelling
the
short
and
ready
road
to
virtue
i
would
that
you
were
going
by
the
longer
for
you
would
more
easily
arrive
by
that
road
than
by
this
of
yours
are
you
not
aware
that
short
cuts
usually
involve
one
in
great
difficulties
for
just
as
is
the
case
with
the
public
roads
a
traveller
who
is
able
to
take
a
short
cut
will
more
easily
than
other
men
go
all
the
way
round
whereas
it
does
not
at
all
follow
that
he
who
went
round
could
always
go
the
short
cut
so
too
in
philosophy
the
end
and
the
beginning
are
one
namely
to
know
oneself
and
to
become
like
the
gods
that
is
to
say
the
first
principle
is
and
the
end
of
conduct
is
the
resemblance
to
the
higher
powers

therefore
he
who
desires
to
be
a
cynic
despises
all
the
usages
and
opinions
of
men
and
turns
his
mind

for

enquire
into
their
value
with
a
view
to
exchanging

leave
it
to
him
to
rate
them
at
their
proper
worth
for
he
knows
that
both
of
them
are
but
earth
and
the
fact
that
one
is
scarcer
and
the
other
easier
to
obtain
he
thinks
is
merely
the
result
of
the
vanity
and
ignorance
of
mankind
he
will
judge
of
the
baseness
or
nobility
of
an
action
not
by
the
applause
or
blame
of
men
but
by
its
intrinsic
nature
he
avoids
any
excess
in
food
and
renounces
the
pleasures
of
love
when
he
is
forced
to
obey
the
needs
of
the
body
he
is
not
the
slave
of
opinion
nor
does
he
wait
for
a
cook
and
sauces
and
a
savoury
smell
nor
does
he
ever
look
about
for
phryne
or
lais
or
so
s
wife
or
young
daughter
or
but
as
far
as
possible
he
satisfies
his
body
s
needs
with
whatever
comes
to
hand
and
by
thrusting
aside
all
hindrances
derived
from
the
body
he
contemplates
from
above
from
the
peaks
of

than

such
as
the
most
ingenious
of

poets
are
always
telling
us
about
now
the
true
short
cut
to
philosophy
is
this
a
man
must
completely
come
out
of
himself
and
recognise
that
he
is
divine
and
not
only
keep
his
mind
untiringly
and
steadfastly
fixed
on
divine
and
stainless
and
pure
thoughts
but
he
must
also
utterly
despise
his
body
and
think
it
in
the
words
of
heracleitus
more
worthless
than
and
by
the
easiest
means
he
must
satisfy
his
body
s
needs
so
long
as
the
god
commands
him
to
use
it
as
an
instrument

so
much
for
that
as
the
saying
is
now
to
go
back
to
the
point
at
which
i
digressed
since
as
i
was
saying
myths
ought
to
be
addressed
either
to
those
who
though
grown
men
are
children
in
intelligence
or
to
those
who
in
actual
years
are
mere
children
we
must
take
pains
to
utter
in
them
no
word
that
is
offensive
to
gods
or
men
or
anything
impious
as
was
done
recently
and
moreover
we
must
in
all
cases
apply
careful
tests
to
see
whether
the
myth
is
plausible
closely
related
to
the
matter
discussed
and
whether
what
is
invented
is
really
a
myth
now
what
you
composed
lately
is
not
your
own
myth
though
you
boasted
that
it
was
nay
your
myth
was
an
old
one
and
you
did
but
adapt
it
to
fresh
circumstances
as
i
believe
people
are
in
the
habit
of
doing
who
use
tropes
and
figures
of
thought
the
poet
of
paros
for
instance
is
much
given
to
this
style
it
seems
then
that
you
did
not
even
invent
your
myth
my
very
clever
friend
and
that
yours
was
an
idle
boast
though
in
fact
the
thing
is
done
by
any
nurse
with
an
inventive
turn
and
if
the
mythical
tales
of
plutarch
had
ever
fallen
into
your
hands
you
would
have
failed
to
observe
what
a
difference
there
is
between
inventing
a
myth
from
the
beginning
and
adapting
to
one
s
own
purpose
a
myth
that
already
exists
but
i
must
not
detain
you
even
for
a
moment
or
hinder
you
on
your
way
along
that
short
cut
to
wisdom
by
making
you
embark
on
books
that
are
long
and
hard
to
read
you
have
not
even
heard
of
the
myth
by
demosthenes
which
he
of
the
paeanian
deme
addressed
to
the
athenians
when
the
macedonian
demanded
that
the
athenian
orators
be
given
up
you
ought
to
have
invented
something
of
that
sort
in
heaven
s
name
was
it
too
hard
for
you
to
relate
some
little
myth
of
the
kind
you
will
force
me
too
to
become
a
maker

a
certain
rich
man
had
numerous
flocks
of
sheep
and
herds
of
cattle

ranging
flocks
of
goats

many

ten

for

and
many
estates
withal
now
much
of
all
this
his
father
had
bequeathed
to
him
but
he
had
himself
acquired
many
times
more
being
eager
to
enrich
himself
whether
justly
or
unjustly
for
little
did
he
care
for
gods
several
wives
he
had
and
sons
and
daughters
by
them
among
whom
he
divided
his
wealth
before
he
died
but
he
did
not
teach
them
how
to
manage
it
or
how
to
acquire
more
if
it
should
fail
or
how
to
preserve
what
they
had
for
in
his
ignorance
he
thought
that
their
mere
numbers
would
suffice
nor
had
he
himself
any
real
knowledge
of
that
sort
of
art
since
he
had
not
acquired
his
wealth
on
any
rational
principle
but
rather
by
use
and
wont
like
quack
doctors
who
try
to
cure
their
patients
by
relying
on
their
experience
only
so
that
many
diseases
escape
them
altogether
accordingly
since
he
thought
that
a
number
of
sons
would
suffice
to
preserve
his
wealth
he
took
no
thought
how
to
make
them
virtuous
but
this
very
thing
proved
to
be
the
beginning
of
their
iniquitous
behaviour
to
one
another
for
every
one
of
them
desired
to
be
as
wealthy
as
his
father
and
to
possess
the
whole
for
himself
alone
and
so
attacked
the
brother
that
was
his
neighbour
now
for
a
time
they
continued
to
behave
thus
and
their
relatives
also
shared
in
the
folly
and
ignorance
of
those
sons
since
they
themselves
had
had
no
better
education
then
ensued
a
general
slaughter
and
heaven
brought
the
tragic
curse
to
fulfilment
for
by
the
edge
of
the
sword
they
divided
their
patrimony
and
everything
was
thrown
into
confusion
the
sons
demolished
the
ancestral
temples
which
their
father
before
them
had
despised
and
had
stripped
of
the
votive
offerings
that
had
been
dedicated
by
many
worshippers
but
not
least
by
his
own
ancestors
and
besides
demolishing
the
temples
they
erected
sepulchres
both
on
new
sites
and
on
the
old
sites
of
the
temples
as
though
impelled
by
fate
or
by
an
unconscious
presentiment
that
they
would
ere
long
need
many
such
sepulchres
seeing
that
they
so
neglected
the
gods

now
when
all
was
in

and
many
marriages
that
were
no
marriages
were
being
concluded
and
the
laws
of
god
and
man
alike
had
been
profaned
zeus
was
moved
with
compassion
and
addressing
himself
to
helios
he
said
o
my
son
divine
offspring
more
ancient
than
heaven
and
earth
art
thou
still
minded
to
resent
the
insolence
of
that
arrogant
and
audacious
mortal
who
by
forsaking
thee
brought
so
many
calamities
on
himself
and
his
race
thinkest
thou
that
though
thou
dost
not
show
thine
anger
and
resentment
against
him
nor
whet
thine
arrows
against
his
children
thou
art
any
less
the
author
of
his
destruction
in
that
thou
dost
abandon
his
house
to
desolation
nay
said
zeus
let
us
summon
the
fates
and
enquire
whether
any
assistance
may
be
given
the
forthwith
the
fates
obeyed
the
call
of
zeus
but
helios
who
was
as
though
absorbed
in
thought
and
inward
debate
yet
gave
constant
heed
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
zeus
then
spoke
the
eldest
of
the
fates
o
our
father
piety
and
justice
both
restrain
us
therefore
it
is
thine
to
prevail
on
them
also
since
thou
hast
ordered
us
to
be
subservient
to
and
zeus
made
answer
truly
they
are
my
daughters
and
it
is
meet
that
i
question
them
what
then
have
ye
to
say
ye
venerable
goddesses
nay
father
they
replied
that
is
as
thou
thyself
dost
ordain
but
be
careful
lest
this
wicked
zeal
for
impious
deeds
prevail
universally
among
i
will
myself

had
been
cast
aside
and
was
despised
though

was

said

then
by

thine
that
thou
wilt
care

for
him

cure
him
of

malady
for
thou
seest
how
he
is
as
it
were
infected
with
smoke
and
filth
and
darkness
and
there
is
danger
that
the
spark
of
fire
which
thou
didst
implant
in

will
be
quenched

when

helios
heard
this
he
was
glad
and
took
pleasure
in

babe
since
he
perceived
that
in
him
a
small
spark
of
himself
was
still
preserved

from
that
time
he
reared

he
learned
numerous
disasters
that
had
befallen
his
kinsmen
and
his
cousins
and
had
all
but
hurled
himself
into
tartarus
so
confounded
was
he
by
the
extent
of
those
calamities
then
helios
of
his
grace
aided
athene
goddess
of
forethought
threw
him
into
a
slumber
or
trance
and
so
diverted
him
from
that
purpose
then
when
he
had
waked
from
this
he
went
away
into
the
desert
and
there
he
found
a
stone
and
rested
for
a
while
thereon
debating
within
himself
how
he
should
escape
evils
so
many
and
so
vast
for
all
things
now
appeared
grievous
to
him
and
for
the
moment
there
was
no
hope
anywhere
then
hermes
who
had
an
affinity
for
him
appeared
to
him
in
the
guise
of
a
youth
of
his
own
age
and
greeting
him
kindly
said
follow
me
and
i
will
guide
thee
by
an
easier
and
smoother
road
as
soon
as
thou
hast
surmounted
this
winding
and
rugged
place
where
thou
seest
all
men
stumbling
and
obliged
to
go
back
then
the
youth
set
out
with
great
circumspection
carrying
a
sword
and
shield
and
spear
though
as
yet
his
head
was
bare
thus
relying
on
hermes
he
went
forward
by
a
road
smooth
untrodden
and
very
bright
and
overhung
with
fruits
and
many
lovely
flowers
such
as
the
gods
love
and
with
trees
also
ivy
and
laurel
and
myrtle
now
when
hermes
had
brought
him
to
the
foot
of
a
great
and
lofty
mountain
he
said
on
the
summit
of
this
mountain
dwells
the
father
of
all
the
gods
be
careful
herein
lies
the
greatest
risk
of
all
worship
him
with
the
utmost
piety
and
ask
of
him
whatever
thou
wilt
thou
wilt
choose
my
child
only
what
is
so
saying
hermes
once
more
became
invisible
though
the
youth
was
fain
to
learn
from
him
what
he
ought
to
ask
from
the
father
of
the
gods
but
when
he
saw
that
he
was
no
longer
at
his
side
he
said
the
advice
though
incomplete
is
good
nevertheless
therefore
let
me
by
the
grace
of
fortune
ask
for
what
is
best
though
i
do
not
as
yet
see
clearly
the
father
of
the
gods
father
whatever
name
thou
dost
please
that
men
should
call
thee
by
me
the
way
that
leads
upwards
to
thee
for
fairer
still
methinks
the
region
where
thou
art

may

of
the
beauty
of
thy

when
he
had
uttered
this
prayer
a
sort
of
slumber
or
ecstasy
came
over
him
then
zeus
showed
him
helios
himself
awestruck
by
that
vision
the
youth
exclaimed
for
this
and
for
all
thy
other
favours
i
will
dedicate
myself
to
thee
o
father
of
the
gods
then
he
cast
his
arms
about
the
knees
of
helios
and
would
not
let
go
his
hold
but
kept
entreating
him
to
save
him
but
helios
called
athene
and
bade
her
first
enquire
of
him
what
arms
he
had
brought
with
him
and
when
she
saw
his
shield
and
sword
and
spear
she
said
but
where
my
child
is
thy
aegis
and
thy
helmet
even
these
that
i
have
he
replied
i
procured
with
difficulty
for
in
the
house
of
my
kinsfolk
there
was
none
to
aid
one
so
learn
therefore
said
mighty
helios
that
thou
must
without
fail
return
thereupon
he
entreated
him
not
to
send
him
to
earth
again
but
to
detain
him
there
since
he
would
never
be
able
to
mount
upwards
a
second
time
but
would
be
overwhelmed
by
the
ills
of
earth
but
as
he
wept
and
implored
helios
replied
nay
thou
art
young
and
not
yet
initiated
return
therefore
to
thine
own
people
that
thou
mayst
be
initiated
and
thereafter
dwell
on
earth
in
safety
for
return
thou
must
and
and
cleanse
away
all
impiety
and
invoke
me
to
aid
thee
and
athene
and
the
other
when
helios
had
said
this
the
youth
remained
silent
then
mighty
helios
led
him
to
a
high
peak
whose
upper
region
was
filled
with
light
but
the
lower
with
the
thickest
mist
imaginable
through
which
as
through
water
the
light
of
the
rays
of
king
helios
penetrated
but
faintly
thou
seest
said
helios
thy
cousin
the
heir
i
see
him
the
youth
replied
again
dost
thou
see
yonder
herdsmen
and
shepherds
the
youth
answered
that
he
did
then
what
thinkest
thou
of
the
heir
s
disposition
and
what
of
his
shepherds
and
herdsmen
he
seems
to
me
replied
the
youth
to
be
for
the
most
part
asleep
sunk
in
forgetfulness
and
devoted
to
pleasure
and
of
his
shepherds
a
few
are
honest
but
most
are
vicious
and
brutal
for
they
devour
or
sell
his
sheep
and
doubly
injure
their
master
in
that
they
not
only
ruin
his
flocks
but
besides
that
they
make
great
gain
and
return
him
but
little
thereof
while
they
declare
with
loud
complaint
that
they
are
defrauded
of
their
wages
and
yet
it
were
better
that
they
should
demand
and
obtain
their
full
pay
than
that
they
should
destroy
the
now
what
if
i
and
athene
here
said
helios
obeying
the
command
of
zeus
should
appoint
thee
to
govern
all
these
in
place
of
the
heir
then
the
youth
clung
to
him
again
and
earnestly
entreated
that
he
might
remain
there
do
not
be
obstinate
in
disobedience
said
helios
ἀπεχθήρω
ὡς
νῦν
ἐφίλησα
lest
perchance
i
hate
thee
beyond

even
as

have
loved

then
said
the

do
thou
o
most
mighty
helios
and
thou
athene
thee
too
father
zeus
do
i
call
to
witness
of
me
as
ye
then
hermes
suddenly
appeared
once
more
and
inspired
him
with
greater
courage
for
now
he
thought
that
he
had
found
a
guide
for
the
journey
back
and
for
his
sojourn
on
earth
then
said
athene
attend
good
youth
that
art
born
of
myself
and
of
this
god
thy
noble
sire
the
most
virtuous
of
the
shepherds
do
not
please
this
heir
for
flatterers
and
profligates
have
made
him
their
slave
and
tool
thus
it
is
that
he
is
not
beloved
by
the
good
and
is
most
deeply
wronged
by
those
who
are
supposed
to
love
him
be
careful
then
when
thou
returnest
that
he
make
thee
not
his
flatterer
rather
than
his
friend
this
second
warning
also
do
thou
heed
my
son
yonder
man
slumbers
and
hence
he
is
often
deceived
but
do
thou
be
sober
and
vigilant
lest
the
flatterer
assume
the
frankness
of
a
friend
and
so
deceive
thee
which
is
as
though
a
smith
covered
with
smoke
and
cinders
should
come
wearing
a
white
garment
and
with
his
face
painted
white
and
thus
induce
thee
to
give
him
one
of
thy
daughters
in
marriage
my
third
warning
to
thee
is
this
do
thou
very
zealously
keep
watch
over
thyself
and
reverence
us
in
the
first
place
and
among
men
only
him
who
resembles
us
and
no
one
besides
thou
seest
how
false
shame
and
excessive
timidity
have
injured
this
foolish

then
mighty
helios
took
up
the
tale
and
said
when
thou
hast
chosen
thy
friends
treat
them
as
friends
and
do
not
regard
them
as
thy
servants
and
attendants
but
let
thy
conduct
towards
them
be
generous
candid
and
honourable
say
not
one
thing
about
them
while
thou
thinkest
another
thou
seest
that
it
was
treachery
to
his
friends
that
destroyed
this
heir
love
thy
subjects
even
as
we
love
thee
prefer
our
worship
to
all
other
blessings
for
we
are
thy
benefactors
and
friends
and
at
these
words
the
youth
became
calm
and
showed
plainly
that
he
was
already
obedient
in
all
things
to
the
gods
come
said
helios
now
depart
with
good
hope
for
everywhere
we
shall
be
with
thee
even
i
and
athene
and
hermes
here
and
with
us
all
the
gods
that
are
on
olympus
or
in
the
air
or
on
earth
and
the
whole
race
of
gods
everywhere
so
long
as
thou
art
pious
towards
us
and
loyal
to
thy
friends
and
humane
towards
thy
subjects
ruling
them
and
guiding
them
to
what
is
best
but
never
yield
to
thy
own
passions
or
become
the
slave
of
theirs
keep
the
armour
that
thou
hast
brought
hither
and
depart
but
first
receive
from
me
this
torch
so
that
even
on
earth
a
great
light
may
shine
for
thee
and
that
thou
mayst
not
long
for
the
things
of
earth
and
from
fair
athene
here
receive
an
aegis
and
helmet
for
as
thou
seest
she
has
many
and
she
gives
them
to
whom
she
will
and
hermes
too
will
give
thee
a
golden
wand
go
then
thus
adorned
in
full
armour
over
sea
and
land
steadfastly
obeying
our
laws
and
let
no
man
or
woman
or
kinsman
or
foreigner
persuade
thee
to
neglect
our
commands
for
while
thou
dost
abide
by
them
thou
wilt
be
loved
and
honoured
by
us
and
respected
by
our
good
servants
and
formidable
to
the
wicked
and
impious
know
that
a
mortal
frame
was
given
to
thee
that
thou
mightest
discharge
these
duties
for
we
desire
out
of
respect
for
thy
ancestor
to
cleanse
the
house
of
thy
forefathers
remember
therefore
that
thou
hast
an
immortal
soul
that
is
our
offspring
and
that
if
thou
dost
follow
us
thou
shalt
be
a
god

now
whether
this
be
a

or
a
true
narrative
i
can
not
say
but
in

whom
do
you
mean
by
pan
and
whom
by
zeus
unless
you
and
i
are
they
that
is
you
are
zeus
and
i
am
pan
what
an
absurd
counterfeit
pan
but
you
are
still
more
absurd
by
asclepius
and
very
far
indeed
from
being
zeus
is
not
all
this
the
utterance
of
a
mouth
that
foams
with
morbid
rather
than
inspired
madness
do
you
not
know
that
salmoneus
in
his
day
was
punished
by
the
gods
for
just
this
for
attempting
though
a
mortal
man
to
play
the
part
of
zeus
then
too
there
is
the
account
in
hesiod
s
poems
of
those
who
styled
themselves
by
the
names
of
the
gods
even
of
hera
and
of
zeus
but
if
you
have
not
heard
of
it
till
this
moment
i
can
excuse
you
for
that
for
you
have
not
been
well
educated
nor
did
fate
bestow
on
you
such
a
guide
to
the
poets
as
i
mean
this
philosopher
now
present
and
later
on
i
arrived
at
the
threshold
of
philosophy
to
be
initiated
therein
by
the
teaching
of
one
whom
i
consider
superior
to
all
the
men
of
my
own
time
he
used
to
teach
me
to
practise
virtue
before
all
else
and
to
regard
the
gods
as
my
guides
to
all
that
is
good
now
whether
he
accomplished
anything
of
real
profit
he
himself
must
determine
or
rather
the
ruling
gods
but
at
least
he
purged
me
of
such
infatuate
folly
and
insolence
as
yours
and
tried
to
make
me
more
temperate
than
i
was
by
nature
and
though
as
you
know
i
was
armed
with
great
external
advantages
nevertheless
i
submitted
myself
to
my
preceptor
and
to
his
friends
and
compeers
and
the
philosophers
of
his
school
and
i
was
eager
to
be
instructed
by
all
whose
praises
i
heard
uttered
by
him
and
i
read
all
the
books
that
he
approved

thus
then
i
was
initiated
by
those
guides
in
the
first
place
by
a
philosopher
who
trained
me
in
the
preparatory
discipline
and
next
by
that
most
perfect
philosopher
who
revealed
to
me
the
entrance
to
philosophy
and
though
i
achieved
but
little
on
account
of
the
engrossing
affairs
that
overwhelmed
me
from
without
still
for
all
that
i
have
had
the
benefit
of
right
training
and
have
not
travelled
by
the
short
road
as
you
say
you
have
but
have
gone
all
the
way
round
though
indeed
i
call
the
gods
to
witness
i
believe
that
the
road
i
took
was
really
a
shorter
road
to
virtue
than
yours
for
i
at
any
rate
if
i
may
say
so
without
bad
taste
am
standing
at
the
entrance
whereas
you
are
a
long
way
even
from
the
entrance
but
as
for
virtue
you
and
your
omit
the
sounding
phrase
and
fill
in
the
blank
yourself
or
rather
if
you
please
bear
with
me
when
i
put
it
mildly
what
part
or
lot
have
you
in
it
you
criticise
everybody
though
you
yourself
do
nothing
to
deserve
praise
your
praises
are
in
worse
taste
than
those
of
the
most
ignorant
rhetoricians
they
because
they
have
nothing
to
say
and
can
not
invent
anything
from
the
matter
in
hand
are
always
dragging
in
delos
and
leto
with
her
children
and
then
swans
singing
their
shrill
song
and
the
trees
that
echo
them
and
dewy
meadows
full
of
soft
deep
grass
and
the
scent
of
flowers
and
the
season
of
spring
and
other
figures
of
the
same
sort
when
did
isocrates
ever
do
this
in
his
panegyrics
or
when
did
anyone
of
those
ancient
writers
who
were
genuine
votaries
of
the
muses
and
not
like
the
writers
of
however
i
omit
what
i
might
add
lest
i
should
make
them
also
my
enemies
and
offend
at
once
the
most
worthless
cynics
and
the
most
worthless
rhetoricians
though
indeed
i
have
nothing
but
friendly
feelings
for
the
really
virtuous
cynics
if
indeed
there
be
any
such
nowadays
and
also
for
all
honest
rhetoricians
but
though
a
vast
number
of
illustrations
of
this
sort
flow
into
my
anyone
who
desired
to
use
them
could
certainly
draw
from
an
ample
jar
shall
refrain
because
of
the
present
pressure
of
business
however
i
have
still
somewhat
to
add
to
my
discourse
like
the
balance
of
a
debt
and
before
i
turn
to
other
matters
let

i
ask
you
then
what
reverence
for
the
names
of
the
gods
was
shown
by
the
pythagoreans
and
by
plato
what
was
aristotle
s
attitude
in
these
matters
is
it
not
worth
while
to
pay
attention
to
this
or
surely
no
one
will
deny
that
he
of
samos
was
reverent
for
he
did
not
even
allow
the
names
of
the
gods
to
be
used
on
a
seal
nor
oaths
to
be
rashly
uttered
in
the
names
of
the
gods
and
if
i
should
go
on
to
say
that
he
also
travelled
to
egypt
and
visited
persia
and
everywhere
endeavoured
to
be
admitted
to
the
inner
mysteries
of
the
gods
and
everywhere
to
be
initiated
into
every
kind
of
rite
i
shall
be
saying
what
is
familiar
and
obvious
to
most
people
though
you
may
not
have
heard
of
it
however
listen
to
what
plato
says
but
for
my
part
protarchus
i
feel
a
more
than
human
awe
indeed
a
fear
beyond
expression
of
the
names
of
the
gods
now
therefore
i
will
address
aphrodite
by
whatever
name
pleases
her
best
though
as
for
pleasure
i
know
that
it
has
many
this
is
what
he
says
in
the
philebus
and
he
says
the
same
sort
of
thing
again
in
the
timaeus
for
he
says
that
we
ought
to
believe
directly
and
without
proof
what
we
are
told
i
mean
what
the
poets
say
about
the
gods
and
i
have
brought
forward
this
passage
for
fear
that
socrates
may
furnish
you
with
an
excuse
i
believe
he
does
to
many
platonists
because
of
his
natural
tendency
to
irony
slight
the
doctrine
of
plato
for
it
is
not
socrates
who
is
speaking
here
but
timaeus
who
had
not
the
least
tendency
to
irony
though
for
that
matter
it
is
not
a
sound
principle
to
enquire
who
says
a
thing
and
to
whom
rather
than
the
actual
words
but
now
will
you
allow
me
to
cite
next
that
siren
the
living
image
of
hermes
the
god
of
eloquence
the
man
dear
to
apollo
and
the
muses
well
he
declares
that
all
who
raise
the
question
or
seek
to
enquire
at
all
whether
gods
exist
ought
not
to
be
answered
as
though
they
were
men
but
to
be
chastised
as
wild
beasts
and
if
you
had
read
that
introductory
sentence
which
was
inscribed
over
the
entrance
to
his
school
like
plato
s
you
would
most
surely
know
that
those
who
entered
the
lyceum
were
warned
to
be
reverent
to
the
gods
to
be
initiated
into
all
the
mysteries
to
take
part
in
the
most
sacred
ceremonies
and
to
be
instructed
in
knowledge
of
every
kind

this
my
young
friend
is
a
very
hard
saying
and
i
am
persuaded
calls
for
more
profound
discussion
may
the
goddesses
themselves
grant
us
understanding
thereof
though
indeed
i
think
that
has
already
been
bestowed
by
them
for
it
is
evident
that
diogenes
was
not
impious
as
you
aver
but
resembled
those
philosophers
whom
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago
for
having
regard
to
the
circumstances
in
which
his
lot
was
cast
and
next
paying
heed
to
the
commands
of
the
pythian
god
and
knowing
that
the
candidate
for
initiation
must
first
be
registered
as
an
athenian
citizen
and
if
he
be
not
an
athenian
by
birth
must
first
become
one
by
law
it
was
this
he
avoided
not
initiation
because
he
considered
that
he
was
a
citizen
of
the
world
and
moreover
such
was
the
greatness
of
his
soul
that
he
thought
he
ought
to
associate
himself
with
the
divine
nature
of
all
the
gods
who
in
common
govern
the
whole
universe
and
not
only
with
those
whose
functions
are
limited
to
certain
portions
of
it
and
out
of
reverence
for
the
gods
he
did
not
transgress
their
laws
though
he
trampled
on
all
other
opinions
and
tried
to
give
a
new
stamp
to
the
common
currency
and
he
did
not
return
to
that
servitude
from
which
he
had
joyfully
been
released
what
servitude
do
i
mean
i
mean
that
he
would
not
enslave
himself
to
the
laws
of
a
single
city
and
submit
himself
to
all
that
must
needs
befall
one
who
had
become
an
athenian
citizen
for
is
it
likely
that
a
man
who
in
order
to
honour
the
gods
journeyed
to
olympia
and
like
socrates
embraced
philosophy
in
obedience
to
the
pythian
oracle
he
says
himself
that
at
home
and
in
private
he
received
the
commands
of
that
oracle
and
hence
came
his
impulse
to
philosophy
it
likely
i
say
that
such
a
man
would
not
very
gladly
have
entered
the
temples
of
the
gods
but
for
the
fact
that
he
was
trying
to
avoid
submitting
himself
to
any
set
of
laws
and
making
himself
the
slave
of
any
one
constitution
but
why
you
will
say
did
he
not
assign
this
reason
but
on
the
contrary
a
reason
that
detracted
not
a
little
from
the
dignity
of
the
mysteries
perhaps
one
might
bring
this
same
reproach
against
pythagoras
as
well
but
the
reasoning
would
be
incorrect
for
everything
ought
not
to
be
told
nay
more
even
of
those
things
that
we
are
permitted
to
declare
some
it
seems
to
me
we
ought
to
refrain
from
uttering
to
the
vulgar
crowd
however
the
explanation
in
this
case
is
obvious
for
since
he
perceived
that
the
man
who
exhorted
him
to
be
initiated
neglected
to
regulate
his
own
life
aright
though
he
prided
himself
on
having
been
initiated
diogenes
wished
at
the
same
time
to
reform
his
morals
and
to
teach
him
that
the
gods
reserve
their
rewards
without
stint
for
those
whose
lives
have
earned
them
the
right
to
be
initiated
even
though
they
have
not
gone
through
the
ceremony
whereas
the
wicked
gain
nothing
by
penetrating
within
the
sacred
precincts
for
this
is
what
the
hierophant
proclaims
when
he
refuses
the
rite
of
initiation
to
him
whose
hands
are
not
pure
or
who
for
any
reason
ought
not

introduction

the
eighth
oration
is
a
speech
of
consolation
παραμυθητικὸς
λόγος
a
familiar
type
of
sophistic
composition
in
consequence
of
the
attacks
on
sallust
by
sycophants
at
court
and
moreover
jealous
of
his
friendship
with
julian
constantius
ordered
him
to
leave
gaul
in
this
discourse
which
was
written
before
the
open
rupture
with
constantius
julian
alludes
only
once
and
respectfully
to
his
cousin
but
asmus
thinks
he
can
detect
in
it
a
general
resemblance
to
the
thirteenth
oration
of
dio
chrysostom
where
dio
tries
to
comfort
himself
for
his
banishment
by
the
tyrant
domitian
and
that
sallust
was
expected
to
appreciate
this
and
the
veiled
attack
on
constantius
julian
addresses
the
discourse
to
himself
but
it
was
no
doubt
sent
to
sallust
after
julian
s
accession
sallust
was
made
prefect
in
and
consul
in
he
was
the
author
of
a
manifesto
of
the
treatise

ah
my
beloved
comrade
unless
i
tell
you
all
that
i
said
to
myself
when
i
learned
that
you
were
compelled
to
journey
far
from
my
side
i
shall
think
i
am
deprived
of
some
comfort
or
rather
i
shall
consider
that
i
have
not
even
begun
to
procure
some
assuagement
for
my
grief
unless
i
have
first
shared
it
with
you
for
we
two
have
shared
in
many
sorrows
and
also
in
many
pleasant
deeds
and
words
in
affairs
private
and
public
at
home
and
in
the
field
and
therefore
for
the
present
troubles
be
they
what
they
may
we
must
needs
discover
some
cure
some
remedy
that
both
can
share
but
who
will
imitate
for
us
the
lyre
of
orpheus
who
will
echo
for
us
the
songs
of
the
sirens
or
discover
the
drug
nepenthe
though
that
was
perhaps
some
tale
full
of
egyptian
lore
or
such
a
tale
as
the
poet
himself
invented
when
in
what
follows
he
wove
in
the
story
of
the
sorrows
of
the
trojans
and
helen
had
learned
it
from
the
egyptians
i
do
not
mean
a
tale
of
all
the
woes
that
the
greeks
and
trojans
inflicted
on
one
another
but
rather
tales
such
as
they
must
be
that
will
dispel
the
griefs
of
men
s
souls
and
have
power
to
restore
cheerfulness
and
calm
for
pleasure
and
pain
methinks
are
connected
at
their
source
and
succeed
each
other
in
turn
and
philosophers
assert
that
in
all
that
befalls
the
wise
man
the
very
greatest
trials
afford
him
as
much
felicity
as
vexation
and
thus
as
they
say
does
the
bee
extract
sweet
dew
from
the
bitterest
herb
that
grows
on
hymettus
and
works
it
into
honey
even
so
bodies
that
are
naturally
healthy
and
robust
are
nourished
by
any
kind
of
food
and
food
that
often
seems
unwholesome
for
others
far
from
injuring
them
makes
them
strong
on
the
other
hand
the
slightest
causes
usually
inflict
very
serious
injuries
on
persons
who
by
nature
or
nurture
or
owing
to
their
habits
have
an
unsound
constitution
and
are
lifelong
invalids
just
so
with
regard
to
the
mind
those
who
have
so
trained
it
that
it
is
not
altogether
unhealthy
but
moderately
sound
though
it
do
not
indeed
exhibit
the
vigour
of
antisthenes
or
socrates
or
the
courage
of
callisthenes
or
the
imperturbability
of
polemon
but
so
that
it
can
under
the
same
conditions
as
theirs
adopt
the
golden
mean
they
i
say
will
probably
be
able
to
remain
cheerful
in
more
trying

for

part
when
i
put
myself
to
the
proof
to
find
out
how
i
am
and
shall
be
affected
by
your
departure
i
felt
the
same
anguish
as
when
at
home
i
first
left
my
preceptor
for
everything
flashed
across
my
mind
at
once
the
labours
that
we
shared
and
endured
together
our
unfeigned
and
candid
conversation
our
innocent
and
upright
intercourse
our
operation
in
all
that
was
good
our
and
zeal
and
eagerness
in
opposing
evildoers
how
often
we
supported
each
other
with
one
equal
temper
how
alike
were
our
ways
how
precious
our
friendship
then
too
there
came
into
my
mind
the
words
then
was
odysseus
left
for
now
i
am
indeed
like
him
since
the
god
has
removed
you
like
hector
beyond
the
range
of
the
shafts
which
have
so
often
been
aimed
at
you
by
sycophants
or
rather
at
me
since
they
desired
to
wound
me
through
you
for
they
thought
that
only
thus
should
i
be
vulnerable
if
they
should
deprive
me
of
the
society
of
a
faithful
friend
and
devoted
who
never
on
any
pretext
failed
to
share
the
dangers
that
threatened
me
moreover
the
fact
that
you
now
have
a
smaller
share
than
i
in
such
labours
and
dangers
does
not
i
think
make
your
grief
less
than
mine
but
you
feel
all
the
more
anxiety
for
me
and
any
harm
that
may
befall
my
person
for
even
as
i
never
set
your
interests
second
to
mine
so
have
i
ever
found
you
equally
well
disposed
towards
me
i
am
therefore
naturally
much
chagrined
that
to
you
who
with

to
all
others

now
that
it
is
natural
for
me
to
be
grieved
by
the
present
event
on
being
parted
for
ever
so
short
a
god
grant
that
it
may
be
short
one
who
is
not
only
my
friend
but
my
loyal
i
think
even
socrates
that
great
herald
and
teacher
of
virtue
will
agree
so
far
at
least
as
i
may
judge
from
the
evidence
on
which
we
rely
for
our
knowledge
of
him
i
mean
the
words
of
plato
at
my
rate
what
he
says
is
ever
more
difficult
did
it
seem
to
me
to
govern
a
state
rightly
for
neither
is
it
possible
to
achieve
anything
without
good
friends
and
loyal
nor
is
it
very
easy
to
obtain
enough
of
and
if
plato
thought
this
more
difficult
than
digging
a
canal
through
mount
athos
what
must
we
expect
to
find
it
we
who
in
wisdom
and
knowledge
are
more
inferior
to
him
than
he
was
to
god
but
it
is
not
only
when
i
think
of
the
help
in
the
administration
that
we
gave
one
another
in
turn
and
which
enabled
us
to
bear
more
easily
all
that
fate
or
our
opponents
brought
to
pass
contrary
to
our
purpose
but
also
because
i
am
destined
soon
to
be
bereft
also
of
what
has
ever
been
my
only
solace
and
delight
it
is
natural
that
i
am
and
have
been
cut
to
the
very
heart
for
in
the
future
to
what
friend
can
i
turn
as
loyal
as
yourself
with
whose
guileless
and
pure
frankness
shall
i
now
brace
myself
who
now
will
give
me
prudent
counsel
reprove
me
with
affection
give
me
strength
for
good
deeds
without
arrogance
and
conceit
and
use
frankness
after
extracting
the
bitterness
from
the
words
like
those
who
from
medicines
extract
what
is
nauseating
but
leave
in
what
is
really
beneficial
these
are
the
advantages
that
i
reaped
from
your
friendship
and
now
that
i
have
been
deprived
of
all
these
all
at
once
with
what
arguments
shall
i
supply
myself
so
that
when
i
am
in
danger
of
flinging
away
my
life
out
of
regret
for
you
and
your
counsels
and
loving
kindness
they
may
persuade
me
to
be
calm
and
to
bear
nobly
whatever
god
has
sent
for
in
accordance
with
the
will
of
god
our
mighty
emperor
has
surely
planned
this
as
all
else
then
what
now
must
be
my
thoughts
what
spells
must
i
find
to
persuade
my
soul
to
bear
tranquilly
the
trouble
with
which
it
is
now
dismayed
shall
i
imitate
the
discourses
of
zamolxis
mean
those
thracian
spells
which
socrates
brought
to
athens
and
declared
that
he
must
utter
them
over
the
fair
charmides
before
he
could
cure
him
of
his
headache
or
must
we
leave
these
alone
as
being
like
large
machinery
in
a
small
theatre
too
lofty
for
our
purpose
and
suited
to
greater
troubles
and
rather
from
the
deeds
of
old
whose
fame
we
have
heard
told
as
the
poet
says
shall
we
gather
the
fairest
flowers
as
though
from
a
variegated
and
meadow
and
thus
console
ourselves
with
such
narratives
and
add
thereto
some
of
the
teachings
of
philosophy
for
just
as
for
instance
certain
drugs
are
infused
into
things
that
have
too
sweet
a
taste
and
thus
their
cloying
sweetness
is
tempered
so
when
tales
like
these
are
seasoned
by
the
maxims
of
philosophy
we
avoid
seeming
to
drag
in
a
tedious
profusion
of
ancient
history
and
a
superfluous

the

who

and

by
him
in

with

yoke
of
friendship
as
the
saying
is
not

took
pleasure
in

society

undertook
no
task
without
first
consulting
with
him
and
obtaining
his
advice
as
to
how
he
should
proceed

was
this
i
understand
that
furnished
those
who
from
envy
slandered
scipio
with
the
saying
that
laelius
was
the
real
author
of
his
enterprises

africanus

about
ourselves

from
resenting
this
i
rather
rejoice
at
it
for
to
accept

zeno
held
to
be
a
sign
of
greater
virtue
than
independently
to
decide
oneself
what
one
ought
to
do

so
he
altered

that
the

i
am
convinced
that
what
hesiod
says
is
truer
that
pythagoras
was
wiser
than
either
of
them
when
he
originated
the
proverb
and
gave
to
mankind
the
maxim
friends
have
all
things
in

by
this
he
certainly
did
not
mean
money

also
a
partnership
in
intelligence

wisdom

all
that
you

belongs
just

much

adopted
it

whenever

let
me
go
back
now
to
africanus
and
laelius
when
carthage
had
been
destroyed
and
all
libya
made
subject
to
rome
africanus
sent
laelius
home
and
he
embarked
to
carry
the
good
news
to
their
fatherland
and
scipio
was
grieved
at
the
separation
from
his
friend
but
he
did
not
think
his
sorrow
inconsolable
laelius
too
was
probably
afflicted
at
having
to
embark
alone
but
he
did
not
regard
it
as
an
insupportable
calamity
cato
also
made
a
voyage
and
left
his
intimate
friends
at
home
and
so
did
pythagoras
and
plato
and
democritus
and
they
took
with
them
no
companion
on
their
travels
though
they
left
behind
them
at
home
many
whom
they
dearly
loved
pericles
also
set
out
on
his
campaign
against
samos
without
taking
anaxagoras
and
he
conquered
euboea
by
following
the
latter
s
advice
for
he
had
been
trained
by
his
teaching
but
the
philosopher
himself
he
did
not
drag
in
his
train
as
though
he
were
part
of
the
equipment
needed
for
battle
and
yet
in
his
case
too
we
are
told
that
much
against
his
will
the
athenians
separated
him
from
the
society
of
his
teacher
but
wise
man
that
he
was
he
bore
the
folly
of
his
citizens
with
fortitude
and
mildness
indeed
he
thought
that
he
must
of
necessity
bow
to
his
country
s
will
when
as
a
mother
might
however
unjustly
she
still
resented
their
close
friendship
and
he
probably
reasoned
as
follows
you
must
take
what
i
say
next
as
the
very
words
of
pericles
the
whole
world
is
my
city
and
fatherland
and
my
friends
are
the
gods
and
lesser
divinities
and
all
good
men
whoever
and
wherever
they
may
be
yet
it
is
right
to
respect
also
the
country
where
i
was
born
since
this
is
the
divine
law
and
to
obey
all
her
commands
and
not
oppose
them
or
as
the
proverb
says
kick
against
the
pricks
for
inexorable
as
the
saying
goes
is
the
yoke
of
necessity
but
we
must
not
even
complain
or
lament
when
her
commands
are
harsher
than
usual
but
rather
consider
the
matter
as
it
actually
is
she
now
orders
anaxagoras
to
leave
me
and
i
shall
see
no
more
my
best
friend
on
whose
account
the
night
was
hateful
to
me
because
it
did
not
allow
me
to
see
my
friend
but
i
was
grateful
to
daylight
and
the
sun
because
they
allowed
me
to
see
him
whom
i
loved
best
but
pericles
if
nature
had
given
you
eyes
only
as
she
has
to
wild
beasts
it
would
be
natural
enough
for
you
to
feel
excessive
grief
but
since
she
has
breathed
into
you
a
soul
and
implanted
in
you
intelligence
by
means
of
which
you
now
behold
in
memory
many
past
events
though
they
are
no
longer
before
you
and
further
since
your
reasoning
power
discovers
many
future
events
and
reveals
them
as
it
were
to
the
eyes
of
your
mind
and
again
your
imagination
sketches
for
you
not
only
those
present
events
which
are
going
on
under
your
eyes
and
allows
you
to
judge
and
survey
them
but
also
reveals
to
you
things
at
a
distance
and
many
thousand
stades
removed
more
clearly
than
what
is
going
on
at
your
feet
and
before
your
eyes
what
need
is
there
for
such
grief
and
resentment
and
to
show
that
i
have
authority
for
what
i
say

so
if
you
employ
your
mind
you
will
easily
from
athens
see
one
who
is
in
ionia
and
from
the
country
of
the
celts
one
who
is
in
illyria
or
thrace
and
from
thrace
or
illyria
one
who
is
in
the
country
of
the
celts
and
moreover
though
plants
if
removed
from
their
native
soil
when
the
weather
and
the
season
are
unfavourable
can
not
be
kept
alive
it
is
not
so
with
men
who
can
remove
from
one
place
to
another
without
completely
deteriorating
or
changing
their
character
and
deviating
from
the
right
principles
that
they
had
before
adopted
it
is
therefore
unlikely
that
our
affection
will
become
blunted
if
indeed
we
do
not
love
and
cherish
each
other
the
more
for
the
separation
for
wantonness
attends
on
satiety
but
love
and
longing
on
want
so
in
this
respect
we
shall
be
better
off
if
our
affection
tends
to
increase
and
we
shall
keep
one
another
firmly
set
in
our
minds
like
holy
images
and
one
moment
i
shall
see
anaxagoras
and
the
next
he
will
see
me
though
nothing
prevents
our
seeing
one
another
at
the
same
instant
i
do
not
mean
our
flesh
and
sinews
and
bodily
outline
and
breasts
in
the
likeness
of
the
bodily
perhaps
there
is
no
reason
why
these
too
should
not
become
visible
to
our
i
mean
our
virtue
our
deeds
and
words
our
intercourse
and
those
conversations
which
we
so
often
held
with
one
another
when
in
perfect
harmony
we
sang
the
praises
of
education
and
justice
and
mind
that
governs
all
things
mortal
and
human
when
too
we
discussed
the
art
of
government
and
law
and
the
different
ways
of
being
virtuous
and
the
noblest
pursuits
everything
in
short
that
occurred
to
us
when
as
occasion
served
we
mentioned
these
subjects
if
we
reflect
on
these
things
and
nourish
ourselves
with
these
images
we
shall
probably
pay
no
heed
to
the
visions
of
dreams
in
the
night
nor
will
the
senses
corrupted
by
the
alloy
of
the
body
exhibit
to
our
minds
empty
and
vain
phantoms
for
we
shall
not
employ
the
senses
at
all
to
assist
and
minister
to
us
but
our
minds
will
have
escaped
from
them
and
so
will
be
exercised
on
the
themes
i
have
mentioned
and
aroused
to
comprehend
and
associate
with
things
incorporeal
for
by
the
mind
we
commune
even
with
god
and
by
its
aid
we
are
enabled
to
see
and
to
grasp
things
that
escape
the
senses
and
are
far
apart
in
space
or
rather
have
no
need
of
space
that
is
to
say
all
of
us
who
have
lived
so
as
to
deserve
such
a
vision
conceiving
it
in
the
mind

ah
but
pericles
inasmuch
as
he
was
a
man
of
lofty
soul
and
was
bred
as
became
a
free
man
in
a
free
city
could
solace
himself
with
such
sublime
arguments
whereas
i
born
of
such
men
as
now
are
must
beguile
and
console
myself
with
arguments
more
human
and
thus
i
assuage
the
excessive
bitterness
of
my
sorrow
since
i
constantly
endeavour
to
devise
some
comfort
for
the
anxious
and
uneasy
ideas
which
keep
assailing
me
as
they
arise
from
this
event
like
a
charm
against
some
wild
beast
that
is
gnawing
into
my
very
vitals
and
my
soul
and
first
and
foremost
of
the
hardships
that
i
shall
have
to
face
is
this
that
now
i
shall
be
bereft
of
our
guileless
intercourse
and
unreserved
conversation
for
i
have
no
one
now
to
whom
i
can
talk
with
anything
like
the
same
confidence
what
you
say
can
not
i
easily
converse
with
myself
nay
will
not
some
one
rob
me
even
of
my
thoughts
and
besides
compel
me
to
think
differently
and
to
admire
what
i
prefer
not
to
admire
or
does
this
robbery
amount
to
a
prodigy
unimaginable
like
writing
on
water
or
boiling
a
stone
or
tracing
the
track
of
the
flight
of
birds
on
the
wing
well
then
since
no
one
can
deprive
us
of
our
thoughts
we
shall
surely
commune
with
ourselves
in
some
fashion
and
perhaps
god
will
suggest
some
alleviation
for
it
is
not
likely
that
he
who
entrusts
himself
to
god
will
be
utterly
neglected
and
left
wholly
desolate
but
over
him
god
stretches
his
hand
endues
him
with
strength
inspires
him
with
courage
and
puts
into
his
mind
what
he
must
do
we
know
too
how
a
divine
voice
accompanied
socrates
and
prevented
him
from
doing
what
he
ought
not
and
homer
also
says
of
achilles
she
put
the
thought
in
his
mind
implying
that
it
is
god
who
suggests
our
thoughts
when
the
mind
turns
inwards
and
first
communes
with
itself
and
then
with
god
alone
by
itself
hindered
by
nothing
external
for
the
mind
needs
no
ears
to
learn
with
still
less
does
god
need
a
voice
to
teach
us
our
duty
but
apart
from
all
communion
with
god
is
vouchsafed
to
the
mind
how
and
in
what
manner
i
have
not
now
leisure
to
inquire
but
that
this
does
happen
is
evident
and
there
are
sure
witnesses
not
obscure
or
only
fit
to
be
classed
with
the
megarians
such
as
have
borne
the
palm
for
wisdom

us
in
all
our
doings
and
that
we
shall
again
renew
our
intercourse
our
grief
must
lose
its
sharpest
sting
for
indeed
in
the
case
of
odysseus
too
who
was
imprisoned
on
the
island
for
all
those
seven
years
and
then
bewailed
his
lot
i
applaud
him
for
his
fortitude
on
other
occasions
but
i
do
not
approve
those
lamentations
for
of
what
avail
was
it
for
him
to
gaze
on
the
fishy
sea
and
shed
tears
never
to
abandon
hope
and
despair
of
one
s
fate
but
to
play
the
hero
in
the
extremes
of
toil
and
danger
does
indeed
seem
to
me
more
than
can
be
expected
of
any
human
being
but
it
is
not
right
to
praise
and
not
to
imitate
the
homeric
heroes
or
to
think
that
whereas
god
was
ever
ready
to
assist
them
he
will
disregard
the
men
of
our
day
if
he
sees
that
they
are
striving
to
attain
that
very
virtue
for
which
he
favoured
those
others
for
it
was
not
physical
beauty
that
he
favoured
since
in
that
case
nireus
would
have
been
more
approved
nor
strength
for
the
laëstrygons
and
the
cyclops
were
infinitely
stronger
than
odysseus
nor
riches
for
had
that
been
so
troy
would
never
have
been
sacked
but
why
should
i
myself
labour
to
discover
the
reason
why
the
poet
says
that
odysseus
was
beloved
by
the
gods
when
we
can
hear
it
from
himself
it
was
ἐπητής
ἐσσι
καὶ
ἀγχίνοος
καὶ
ἐχέφρων
because
thou
art
so
wary
so
ready
of
wit

it
is
therefore
evident
that
if
we
have
these
qualities
in
addition
god
on
his
side
will
not
fail
us

now
that
i

consoled
myself
with

arguments
i
will
go
back
to
that
other
consideration
which
though
it
seems
trivial
nevertheless
is
generally
esteemed
to
be
not
ignoble
even
alexander
we
are
told
felt
a
need
for
homer
not
of
course
to
be
his
companion
but
to
be
his
herald
as
he
was
for
achilles
and
patroclus
and
the
two
ajaxes
and
antilochus
but
alexander
ever
despising
what
he
had
and
longing
for
what
he
had
not
could
never
be
content
with
his
contemporaries
or
be
satisfied
with
the
gifts
that
had
been
granted
to
him
and
even
if
homer
had
fallen
to
his
lot
he
would
probably
have
coveted
the
lyre
of
apollo
on
which
the
god
played
at
the
nuptials
of
peleus
and
he
would
not
have
regarded
it
as
an
invention
of
homer
s
genius
but
an
actual
fact
that
had
been
woven
into
the
epic
as
when
for
instance
homer
says
ἠὼς

in
alexander
s
case
whether
a
superabundance
of
virtue
and
an
intelligence
that
matched
the
advantages
with
which
he
was
endowed
exalted
his
soul
to
such
heights

he
aimed
at
greater
achievements
than
are
within

scope
of

men
or
whether
the
cause
was
an
excess
of
courage
and
valour
that
led
him
into
ostentation
and
bordered
on
sinful
pride
must
be
left
as
a
general
topic
for
consideration
by
those
who
desire
to
write
either
a
panegyric
of
him

a
criticism

indeed
anyone
thinks
that
criticism
also
can
properly

on

can

here
however
i
am
reminded
of
the
report
current
that
you
are
going
not
only
to
illyria
but
to
thrace
also
and
among
the
greeks
who
dwell
on
the
shores
of
that
sea
among
them
i
was
born
and
brought
up
and
hence
i
have
a
deeply
rooted
affection
for
them
and
for
those
parts
and
the
cities
there
and
it
may
be
that
in
their
hearts
also
there
still
remains
no
slight
affection
for
me
i
am
therefore
well
assured
that
you
will
as
the
saying
is
gladden
their
hearts
by
your
coming
and
there
will
be
a
fair
exchange
since
they
will
gain
in
proportion
as
i
lose
by
your
leaving
me
here
and
i
say
this
not
because
i
wish
you
to
it
were
far
better
if
you
should
return
to
me
by
the
same
road
without
the
thought
in
my
mind
is
that
even
for
this
loss
i
shall
not
be
without
comfort
or
consolation
since
i
can
rejoice
with
them
on
seeing
you
just
come
from
us
i
say
us
since
on
your
account
i
now
rank
myself
among
the
celts
seeing
that
you
are
worthy
to
be
counted
among
the
most
distinguished
greeks
for
your
upright
administration
and
your
other
virtues
and
also
for
your
consummate
skill
in
oratory
in
philosophy
too
you
are
thoroughly
versed
a
field
wherein
the
greeks
alone
have
attained
the
highest
rank
for
they
sought
after
truth
as
its
nature
requires
by
the
aid
of
reason
and
did
not
suffer
us
to
pay
heed
to
incredible
fables
or
impossible
miracles
like
most
of
the
barbarians

letter
to
themistius
the
philosopher
introduction
on
the
strength
of
his
aristotelian
paraphrases
themistius
may
be
called
a
scholar
though
hardly
a
philosopher
as
he
himself
claimed
technically
he
was
a
sophist
that
is
to
say
he
gave
public
lectures
ἐπιδείξεις
wrote
exercises
after
the
sophistic
pattern
and
went
on
embassies
which
were
entrusted
to
him
solely
on
account
of
his
persuasive
charm
but
he
insisted
that
he
was
no
sophist
because
he
took
no
fees
and
styled
himself
a
practical
philosopher
he
was
indifferent
to
the
platonic
philosophy
and
since
constantius
made
him
a
senator
he
can
not
have
betrayed
any
zeal
for
the
pagan
religion
from
julian
s
pagan
restoration
he
seems
to
have
held
aloof
and
though
julian
had
been
his
pupil
probably
at
nicomedia
he
did
not
appoint
him
to
any
office
under
the
christian
emperor
theodosius
he
held
a
prefecture
there
is
no
evidence
for
a
positive
coolness
such
as
zeller
assumes
between
themistius
and
julian
and
we
know
too
little
of
their
relations
to
assert
with
some
critics
that
the
respectful
tone
of
this
letter
is
ironical
it
was
probably
written
after
julian
had
become
emperor
though
there
is
nothing
in
it
that
would
not
suit
an
earlier
date
it
is
sometimes
assigned
to
when
julian
was
still
caesar
the
quotations
from
aristotle
are
appropriately
addressed

themistius

aristotelian

i
earnestly
desire
to
fulfil
your
hopes
of
me
even
as
you
express
them
in
your
letter
but
i
am
afraid
i
shall
fall
short
of
them
since
the
expectations
you
have
raised
both
in
the
minds
of
others
and
still
more
in
your
own
are
beyond
my
powers
there
was
a
time
when
i
believed
that
i
ought
to
try
to
rival
men
who
have
been
most
distinguished
for
excellence
alexander
for
instance
or
marcus
but
i
shivered
at
the
thought
and
was
seized
with
terror
lest
i
should
fail
entirely
to
come
up
to
the
courage
of
the
former
and
should
not
make
even
the
least
approach
to
the
latter
s
perfect
virtue
with
this
in
mind
i
convinced
myself
that
i
preferred
a
life
of
leisure
and
i
both
gladly
recalled
the
attic
manner
of
living
and
thought
myself
to
be
in
sweet
accord
with
you
who
are
my
friends
just
as
those
who
carry
heavy
burdens
lighten
their
labour
by
singing
but
by
your
recent
letter
you
have
increased
my
fears
and
you
point
to
an
enterprise
in
every
way
more
difficult
you
say
that
god
has
placed
me
in
the
same
position
as
heracles
and
dionysus
of
old
who
being
at
once
philosophers
and
kings
purged
almost
the
whole
earth
and
sea
of
the
evils
that
infested
them
you
bid
me
shake
off
all
thought
of
leisure
and
inactivity
that
i
may
prove
to
be
a
good
soldier
worthy
of
so
high
a
destiny
and
besides
those
examples
you
go
on
to
remind
me
of
givers
such
as
solon
pittacus
and
lycurgus
and
you
say
that
men
have
the
right
to
expect
from
me
now
greater
things
than
from
any
of
these
when
i
read
these
words
i
was
almost
dumbfounded
for
on
the
one
hand
i
was
sure
that
it
was
unlawful
for
you
as
a
philosopher
to
flatter
or
deceive
on
the
other
hand
i
am
fully
conscious
that
by
nature
there
is
nothing
remarkable
about
never
was
from
the
first
nor
has
there
come
to
be
now
as
regards
philosophy
i
have
only
fallen
in
love
with
it
i
say
nothing
of
the
fates
that
have
intervened
to
make
that
love
so
far
ineffectual
i
could
not
tell
therefore
how
i
ought
to
interpret
such
expressions
until
god
brought
it
into
my
mind
that
perhaps
by
your
very
praises
you
wished
to
exhort
me
and
to
point
out
how
great
are
those
trials
to
which
a
statesman
must
inevitably
be
exposed
every
day
of
his
life

but
your
method
is
more
likely
to
discourage
than
to
make
one
eager
for
such
an
existence
suppose
that
a
man
were
navigating
your
strait
and
were
finding
even
that
none
too
easy
or
safe
and
then
suppose
some
professional
soothsayer
should
tell
him
that
he
would
have
to
traverse
the
aegaean
and
then
the
ionian
sea
and
finally
embark
on
the
outer
sea
here
that
prophet
would
say
you
see
towns
and
harbours
but
when
you
arrive
there
you
will
see
not
so
much
as
a
or
a
rock
but
you
will
be
thankful
to
descry
even
a
ship
in
the
distance
and
to
hail
her
crew
you
will
often
pray
to
god
that
you
may
however
late
touch
land
and
reach
a
harbour
though
that
were
to
be
the
last
day
of
your
life
you
will
pray
to
be
allowed
to
bring
home
your
ship
safe
and
sound
and
restore
your
crew
unscathed
to
their
friends
and
then
to
commit
your
body
to
mother
earth
and
this
indeed
may
happen
but
you
will
not
be
sure
of
it
until
that
final
do
you
think
that
such
a
man
after
being
told
all
this
would
choose
even
to
live
in
a
town
would
he
not
bid
adieu
to
and
all
the
advantages
of
commerce
and
caring
little
for
troops
of
friends
and
acquaintances
abroad
and
all
that
he
might
learn
about
nations
and
cities
would
he
not
approve
the
wisdom
of
the
son
of
neocles
who
bids
us
live
in
obscurity
indeed
you
apparently
perceived
this
and
by
your
abuse
of
epicurus
you
tried
to
forestall
me
and
to
eradicate
beforehand
any
such
purpose
for
you
go
on
to
say
that
it
was
to
be
expected
that
so
idle
a
man
as
he
should
commend
leisure
and
conversations
during
walks
now
for
my
part
i
have
long
been
firmly
convinced
that
epicurus
was
mistaken
in
that
view
of
his
but
whether
it
be
proper
to
urge
into
public
life
any
and
every
man
both
him
who
lacks
natural
abilities
and
him
who
is
not
yet
completely
equipped
is
a
point
that
deserves
the
most
careful
consideration
we
are
told
that
socrates
dissuaded
from
the
statesman
s
profession
many
who
had
no
great
natural
talent
and
glaucon
too
xenophon
tells
us
and
that
he
tried
to
restrain
the
son
of
cleinias
also
but
could
not
curb
the
youth
s
impetuous
ambition
then
shall
we
try
to
force
into
that
career
men
who
are
reluctant
and
conscious
of
their
deficiencies
and
urge
them
to
be
about
such
great
tasks
for
in
such
matters
not
virtue
alone
or
a
wise
policy
is
paramount
but
to
a
far
greater
degree
fortune
holds
sway
throughout
and
compels
events
to
incline
as
she
wills
chrysippus
indeed
though
in
other
respects
he
seems
a
wise
man
and
to
have
been
rightly
so
esteemed
yet
in
ignoring
fortune
and
chance
and
all
other
such
external
causes
that
fall
in
to
block
the
path
of
men
of
affairs
he
uttered
paradoxes
wholly
at
variance
with
facts
about
which
the
past
teaches
us
clearly
by
countless
examples
for
instance
shall
we
call
cato
a
fortunate
and
happy
man
or
shall
we
say
that
dio
of
sicily
had
a
happy
lot
it
is
true
that
for
death
they
probably
cared
nothing
but
they
did
care
greatly
about
not
leaving
unfinished
the
undertakings
which
they
had
originally
set
on
foot
and
to
secure
that
end
there
is
nothing
that
they
would
not
have
endured
in
that
they
were
disappointed
and
i
admit
that
they
bore
their
lot
with
great
dignity
as
we
learn
and
derived
no
small
consolation
from
their
virtue
but
happy
one
could
not
call
them
seeing
that
they
had
failed
in
all
those
noble
enterprises
unless
perhaps
according
to
the
stoic
conception
of
happiness
and
with
regard
to
that
same
stoic
conception
we
must
admit
that
to
be
applauded
and
to
be
counted
happy
are
two
very
different
things
and
that
if
every
living
thing
naturally
desires
happiness
it
is
better
to
make
it
our
aim
to
be
congratulated
on
the
score
of
happiness
rather
than
to
be
applauded
on
the
score
of
virtue
but
happiness
that
depends
on
the
chances
of
fortune
is
very
rarely
secure
and
yet
men
who
are
engaged
in
public
life
can
not
as
the
saying
is
so
much
as
breathe
unless
she
is
on
their
side
and
they
have
created
a
merely
verbal
idea
of
a
leader
who
is
established
somewhere
above
all
the
chances
of
fortune
in
the
sphere
of
things
incorporeal
and
intelligible
just
as
men
define
the
ideas
whether
envisaging
them
truly
or
falsely
imagining
them
or
again
they
give
us
the
ideal
man
according
to
diogenes

and
to
show
that
i
am
not
the
only
one
who
thinks
that
fortune
has
the
upper
hand
in
practical
affairs
i
will
quote
to
you
a
passage
from
that
admirable
work
the
laws
of
plato
you
know
it
well
and
indeed
taught
it
to
me
but
i
have
set
down
the
speech
which
runs
something
like
this
and
offer
it
as
a
proof
that
i
am
not
really
indolent
god
governs
all
things
and
with
god
fortune
and
opportunity
govern
all
human
affairs
but
there
is
a
milder
view
that
art
must
needs
go
with
them
and
must
be
their
he
then
indicates
what
must
be
the
character
of
a
man
who
is
the
craftsman
and
artificer
of
noble
deeds
and
a
divinely
inspired
king
then
he
says
kronos
therefore
as
i
have
already
related
knew
that
human
nature
when
endowed
with
supreme
authority
is
never
in
any
case
capable
of
managing
human
affairs
without
being
filled
with
insolence
and
injustice
therefore
having
regard
to
this
he
at
that
time
set
over
our
cities
as
kings
and
governors
not
men
but
beings
of
a
more
divine
and
higher
race
i
mean
demons
thus
doing
as
we
do
now
for
our
flocks
and
domestic
herds
we
never
appoint
certain
oxen
to
rule
over
other
oxen
or
goats
to
rule
over
goats
but
we
are
their
masters
a
race
superior
to
theirs
in
like
manner
then
god
since
he
loves
mankind
has
set
over
us
a
race
of
beings
superior
to
ourselves
the
race
of
demons
and
they
with
great
ease
both
to
themselves
and
us
undertake
the
care
of
us
and
dispense
peace
reverence
aye
and
above
all
justice
without
stint
and
thus
they
make
the
tribes
of
men
harmonious
and
happy
and
that
account
is
a
true
one
which
declares
that
in
our
day
all
cities
that
are
governed
not
by
a
god
but
by
a
mortal
man
have
no
relief
from
evils
and
hardships
and
the
lesson
is
that
we
ought
by
every
means
in
our
power
to
imitate
that
life
which
is
said
to
have
existed
in
the
days
of
kronos
and
in
so
far
as
the
principle
of
immortality
is
in
us
we
ought
to
be
guided
by
it
in
our
management
of
public
and
private
affairs
of
our
houses
and
cities
calling
the
distribution
of
mind
but
whether
the
government
be
in
the
hands
of
one
man
or
of
an
oligarchy
or
democracy
if
it
have
a
soul
that
hankers
after
pleasure
and
the
lower
appetites
and
demands
to
indulge
these
and
if
such
a
one
rule
over
a
city
or
individual
having
first
trampled
on
the
laws
there
is
no
means

i
have
purposely
set
down
the
whole
of
this
speech
for
you
lest
you
should
think
that
i
am
cheating
and
defrauding
by
bringing
forward
ancient
myths
which
may
have
some
resemblance
to
the
truth
but
on
the
whole
are
not
composed
with
regard
to
truth
but
what
is
the
true
meaning
of
this
narrative
you
hear
what
it
says
that
even
though
a
prince
be
by
nature
human
he
must
in
his
conduct
be
divine
and
a
and
must
completely
banish
from
his
soul
all
that
is
mortal
and
brutish
except
what
must
remain
to
safeguard
the
needs
of
the
body
now
if
reflecting
on
this
one
is
afraid
to
be
constrained
to
adopt
a
life
from
which
so
much
is
expected
do
you
therefore
conclude
that
one
admires
the
inaction
recommended
by
epicurus
the
gardens
and
suburbs
of
athens
and
its
myrtles
or
the
humble
home
of
socrates
but
never
has
anyone
seen
me
prefer
these
to
a
life
of
toil
that
toil
of
mine
i
would
willingly
recount
to
you
and
the
hazards
that
threatened
me
from
my
friends
and
kinsfolk
at
the
time
when
i
began
to
study
under
you
if
you
did
not
yourself
know
them
well
enough
you
are
well
aware
of
what
i
did
in
the
first
place
in
ionia
in
opposition
to
one
who
was
related
to
me
by
ties
of
blood
but
even
more
closely
by
ties
of
friendship
and
that
in
behalf
of
a
foreigner
with
whom
i
was
very
slightly
acquainted
i
mean
the
sophist
did
i
not
endure
to
leave
the
country
for
the
sake
of
my
friends
indeed
you
know
how
i
took
the
part
of
carterius
when
i
went
unsolicited
to
our
friend
araxius
to
plead
for
him
and
in
behalf
of
the
property
of
that
admirable
woman
arete
and
the
wrongs
she
had
suffered
from
her
neighbours
did
i
not
journey
to
phrygia
for
the
second
time
within
two
months
though
i
was
physically
very
weak
from
the
illness
that
had
been
brought
on
by
former
fatigues
finally
before
i
went
to
greece
while
i
was
still
with
the
army
and
running
what
most
people
would
call
the
greatest
possible
risks
recall
now
what
sort
of
letters
i
wrote
to
you
never
filled
with
complaints
or
containing
anything
little
or
mean
or
servile
and
when
i
returned
to
greece
when
everyone
regarded
me
as
an
exile
did
i
not
welcome
my
fate
as
though
it
were
some
high
festival
and
did
i
not
say
that
the
exchange
to
me
was
most
delightful
and
that
as
the
saying
is
i
had
thereby
gained

for

the
price
of

was
my
joy
at
obtaining
the
chance
to
live
in
greece
instead
of
in
my
own
home
though
i
possessed
there
no
land
or
garden
or
the
humblest
house

but
perhaps
you
think
that
though
i
can
bear
adversity
in
the
proper
spirit
yet
i
show
a
poor
and
mean
spirit
towards
the
good
gifts
of
fortune
seeing
that
i
prefer
athens
to
the
pomp
that
now
surrounds
me
because
you
will
doubtless
say
i
approve
the
leisure
of
those
days
and
disparage
my
present
life
because
of
the
vast
amount
of
work
that
the
latter
involves
but
perhaps
you
ought
to
judge
of
me
more
accurately
and
not
consider
the
question
whether
i
am
idle
or
industrious

rather

πρὸς

to
me
at
any
rate
it
seems
that
the
task
of
reigning
is
beyond
human
powers
and
that
a
king
needs
a
more
divine
character
as
indeed
plato
too
used
to
say
and
now
i
will
write
out
a
passage
from
aristotle
to
the
same
effect
not
bringing
owls
to
the
athenians
but
in
order
to
show
you
that
i
do
not
entirely
neglect
his
writings
in
his
political
treatises
he
says
now
even
if
one
maintain
the
principle
that
it
is
best
for
cities
to
be
governed
by
a
king
how
will
it
be
about
his
children
ought
his
children
to
succeed
him
and
yet
if
they
prove
to
be
no
better
than
anybody
else
that
would
be
a
bad
thing
for
the
city
but
you
may
say
though
he
has
the
power
he
will
not
leave
the
succession
to
his
children
it
is
difficult
indeed
to
believe
that
he
will
not
for
that
would
be
too
hard
for
him
and
demands
a
virtue
greater
than
belongs
to
human
and
later
on
when
he
is
describing
a
king
who
rules
according
to
law
and
says
that
he
is
both
the
servant
and
guardian
of
the
laws
he
does
not
call
him
a
king
at
all
nor
does
he
consider
such
a
king
as
a
distinct
form
of
government
and
he
goes
on
to
say
now
as
for
what
is
called
absolute
monarchy
that
is
to
say
when
a
king
governs
all
other
men
according
to
his
own
will
some
people
think
that
it
is
not
in
accordance
with
the
nature
of
things
for
one
man
to
have
absolute
authority
over
all
the
citizens
since
those
who
are
by
nature
equal
must
necessarily
have
the
same
again
a
little
later
he
says
it
seems
therefore
that
he
who
bids
reason
rule
is
really
preferring
the
rule
of
god
and
the
laws
but
he
who
bids
man
rule
adds
an
element
of
the
beast
for
desire
is
a
wild
beast
and
passion
which
warps
even
the
best
men
it
follows
therefore
that
law
is
reason
exempt
from
you
see
the
philosopher
seems
here
clearly
to
distrust
and
condemn
human
nature
for
he
says
so
in
so
many
words
when
he
asserts
that
human
nature
is
in
no
case
worthy
of
such
an
excess
of
fortune
for
he
thinks
that
it
is
too
hard
for
one
who
is
merely
human
to
prefer
the
general
weal
of
the
citizens
to
his
own
children
he
says
that
it
is
not
just
that
one
man
should
rule
over
many
who
are
his
equals
and
finally
he
puts
the
finishing
stroke
to
what
he
has
just
said
when
he
asserts
that
law
is
reason
exempt
from
desire
and
that
political
affairs
ought
to
be
entrusted
to
reason
alone
and
not
to
any
individual
man
whatever
for
the
reason
that
is
in
men
however
good
they
may
be
is
entangled
with
passion
and
desire
those
most
ferocious
monsters
these
opinions
it
seems
to
me
harmonise
perfectly
with
plato
s
first
that
he
who
governs
ought
to
be
superior
to
his
subjects
and
surpass
them
not
only
in
his
acquired
habits
but
also
in
natural
endowment
a
thing
which
is
not
easy
to
find
among
men
thirdly
that
he
ought
by
every
means
in
his
power
to
observe
the
laws
not
those
that
were
framed
to
meet
some
sudden
emergency
or
established
as
now
appears
by
men
whose
lives
were
not
wholly
guided
by
reason
but
he
must
observe
them
only
in
case
the
lawgiver
having
purified
his
mind
and
soul
in
enacting
those
laws
keeps
in
view
not
merely
the
crimes
of
the
moment
or
immediate
contingencies
but
rather
recognises
the
nature
of
government
and
the
essential
nature
of
justice
and
has
carefully
observed
also
the
essential
nature
of
guilt
and
then
applies
to
his
task
all
the
knowledge
thus
derived
and
frames
laws
which
have
a
general
application
to
all
the
citizens
without
regard
to
friend
or
foe
neighbour
or
kinsman
and
it
is
better
that
such
a
lawgiver
should
frame
and
promulgate
his
laws
not
for
his
contemporaries
only
but
for
posterity
also
or
for
strangers
with
whom
he
neither
has
nor
expects
to
have
any
private
dealings
for
instance
i
hear
that
the
wise
solon
having
consulted
his
friends
about
the
cancelling
of
debts
furnished
them
with
an
opportunity
to
make
money
but
brought
on
himself
a
disgraceful
accusation
so
hard
is
it
to
avoid
such
fatalities
even
when
a
man
brings
a
passionless
mind
to
the
task
of
governing

among

your

you
must
enter

it

your

formidable

would
have
disconcerted

made

before

began
you
may
now
suppose
that
i
have
been
affected
in

manner
by
just
such
words

very
soon

but
i
should
like
to
make
clear
to
you
the
points
in
your
letter
by
which
i
am
puzzled
my
dearest
friend
to
whom
i
especially
am
bound
to
pay
every
honour
for
i
am
eager
to
be
more
precisely
informed
about
them
you
said
that
you
approve
a
life
of
action
rather
than
the
philosophic
life
and
you
called
to
witness
the
wise
aristotle
who
defines
happiness
as
virtuous
activity
and
discussing
the
difference
between
the
statesman
s
life
and
the
life
of
contemplation
showed
a
certain
hesitation
about
those
lives
and
though
in
others
of
his
writings
he
preferred
the
contemplative
life
in
this
place
you
say
he
approves
the
architects
of
noble
actions
but
it
is
you
who
assert
that
these
are
kings
whereas
aristotle
does
not
speak
in
the
sense
of
the
words
that
you
have
introduced
and
from
what
you
have
quoted
one
would
rather
infer
the
contrary
for
when
he
says
we
most
correctly
use
the
word
act
of
those
who
are
the
architects
of
public
affairs
by
virtue
of
their
intelligence
we
must
suppose
that
what
he
says
applies
to
lawgivers
and
political
philosophers
and
all
whose
activity
consists
in
the
use
of
intelligence
and
reason
but
that
it
does
not
apply
to
those
who
do
the
work
themselves
and
those
who
transact
the
business
of
politics
but
in
their
case
it
is
not
enough
that
they
should
consider
and
devise
and
instruct
others
as
to
what
must
be
done
but
it
is
their
duty
to
undertake
and
execute
whatever
the
laws
ordain
and
circumstances
as
well
often
force
them
unless
indeed
we
call
that
man
an
architect
who
is
well
versed
in
mighty
deeds
a
phrase
which
homer
in
his
poems
usually
applies
to
heracles
who
was
indeed
of
all
men
that
ever
lived
most
given
to
do
the
work
himself

but
if
we
conceive
this
to
be
true
or
that
only
those
are
happy
who
administer
public
affairs
and
who
are
in
authority
and
rule
over
many
what
then
are
we
to
say
about
socrates
as
for
pythagoras
and
democritus
and
anaxagoras
of
clazomenae
you
will
perhaps
say
that
they
were
happy
in
another
sense
of
the
word
because
of
their
philosophic
speculations
but
as
for
socrates
who
having
rejected
the
speculative
life
and
embraced
a
life
of
action
had
no
authority
over
his
own
wife
or
his
son
can
we
say
of
him
that
he
governed
even
two
or
three
of
his
then
will
you
assert
that
since
he
had
no
authority
over
any
one
he
accomplished
nothing
on
the
contrary
i
maintain
that
the
son
of
sophroniscus
performed
greater
tasks
than
alexander
for
to
him
i
ascribe
the
wisdom
of
plato
the
generalship
of
xenophon
the
fortitude
of
antisthenes
the
eretrian
and
megarian
philosophies
cebes
simmias
phaedo
and
a
host
of
others
not
to
mention
the
offshoots
derived
from
the
same
source
the
lyceum
the
stoa
and
the
academies
who
i
ask
ever
found
salvation
through
the
conquests
of
alexander
what
city
was
ever
more
wisely
governed
because
of
them
what
individual
improved
many
indeed
you
might
find
whom
those
conquests
enriched
but
not
one
whom
they
made
wiser
or
more
temperate
than
he
was
by
nature
if
indeed
they
have
not
made
him
more
insolent
and
arrogant
whereas
all
who
now
find
their
salvation
in
philosophy
owe
it
to
socrates
and
i
am
not
the
only
person
to
perceive
this
fact
and
to
express
it
for
aristotle
it
seems
did
so
before
me
when
he
said
that
he
had
just
as
much
right
to
be
proud
of
his
treatise
on
the
gods
as
the
conqueror
of
the
persian
empire
and
i
think
he
was
perfectly
correct
in
that
conclusion
for
military
success
is
due
to
courage
and
good
fortune
more
than
anything
else
or
let
us
say
if
you
wish
to
intelligence
as
well
though
of
the
common
everyday
sort
but
to
conceive
true
opinions
about
god
is
an
achievement
that
not
only
requires
perfect
virtue
but
one
might
well
hesitate
whether
it
be
proper
to
call
one
who
attains
to
this
a
man
or
a
god
for
if
the
saying
is
true
that
it
is
the
nature
of
everything
to
become
known
to
those
who
have
an
affinity
with
it
then
he
who
comes
to
know
the
essential
nature
of
god
would
naturally
be
considered
divine

but
since
i
seem
to
have
harked
back
to
the
life
of
contemplation
and
to
be
comparing
it
with
the
life
of
action
though
in
the
beginning
of
your
letter
you
declined
to
make
the
comparison
i
will
remind
you
of
those
very
philosophers
whom
you
mentioned
areius
nicolaus
thrasyllus
and
musonius
so
far
from
any
one
of
these
governing
his
own
city
areius
we
are
told
refused
the
governorship
of
egypt
when
it
was
offered
to
him
and
thrasyllus
by
becoming
intimate
with
the
harsh
and
naturally
cruel
tyrant
tiberius
would
have
incurred
indelible
disgrace
for
all
time
had
he
not
cleared
himself
in
the
writings
that
he
left
behind
him
and
so
shown
his
true
character
so
little
did
his
public
career
benefit
him
nicolaus
did
not
personally
do
any
great
deeds
and
he
is
known
rather
by
his
writings
about
such
deeds
while
musonius
became
famous
because
he
bore
his
sufferings
with
courage
and
by
zeus
sustained
with
firmness
the
cruelty
of
tyrants
and
perhaps
he
was
not
less
happy
than
those
who
administered
great
kingdoms
as
for
areius
when
he
declined
the
governorship
of
egypt
he
deliberately
deprived
himself
of
the
highest
end
if
he
really
thought
that
this
was
the
most
important
thing
and
you
yourself
i
ask
do
you
lead
an
inactive
life
because
you
are
not
a
general
or
a
public
speaker
and
govern
no
nation
or
city
nay
no
one
with
any
sense
would
say
so
for
it
is
in
your
power
by
producing
many
philosophers
or
even
only
three
or
four
to
confer
more
benefit
on
the
lives
of
men
than
many
kings
put
together
to
no
trivial
province
the
philosopher
appointed
and
as
you
said
yourself
he
does
not
only
direct
counsels
or
public
affairs
nor
is
his
activity
confined
to
mere
words
but
if
he
confirm
his
words
by
deeds
and
show
himself
to
be
such
as
he
wishes
others
to
be
he
may
be
more
convincing
and
more
effective
in
making
men
act
than
those
who
urge
them
to
noble
actions
by
issuing
commands

but
i
must
go
back
to
what
i
said
at
the
beginning
and
conclude
this
letter
which
is
perhaps
longer
already
than
it
should
be
and
the
main
point
in
it
is
that
it
is
not
because
i
would
avoid
hard
work
or
pursue
pleasure
nor
because
i
am
in
love
with
idleness
and
ease
that
i
am
averse
to
spending
my
life
in
administration
but
as
i
said
when
i
began
it
is
because
i
am
conscious
that
i
have
neither
sufficient
training
nor
natural
talents
above
the
ordinary
moreover
i
am
afraid
of
bringing
reproach
on
philosophy
which
much
as
i
love
it
i
have
never
attained
to
and
which
on
other
accounts
has
no
very
good
reputation
among
men
of
our
day
for
these
reasons
i
wrote
all
this
down
some
time
ago
and
now
i
have
freed
myself
from
your
charges
as
far
as
i
can

may
god
grant
me
the
happiest
fortune
possible
and
wisdom
to
match
my
fortune
for
now
i
think
i
need
assistance
from
god
above
all
and
also
from
you
philosophers

all
means
in
your
power

i
have
proved
myself
your
leader

champion

should
it
be
that
blessings
greater
than
of
my
furnishing
and
than
the
opinion
that
i
now
have
of
myself
should
be
granted
to
men
by
god
through
my
instrumentality
you
must
not
resent
my
words
for
being
conscious
or
no
good
thing
in
me
save
this
only
that
i
do
not
even
think
that
i
possess
the
highest
talent
and
indeed
have
naturally
none
i
cry
aloud
and
testify
that
you
must
not
expect
great
things
of
me
but
must
entrust
everything
to
god
for
thus
i
shall
be
free
from
responsibility
for
my
shortcomings
and
if
everything
turns
out
favourably
i
shall
be
discreet
and
moderate
not
putting
my
name
to
the
deeds
of
other
men
but
by
giving
god
the
glory
for
all
as
is
right
it
is
to
him
that
i
shall
myself

many
were
the
achievements
of
your
forefathers
of
which
you
are
still
justly
proud
even
as
they
were
of
old
many
were
the
trophies
for
victories
raised
by
them
now
for
all
greece
in
common
now
separately
for
athens
herself
in
those
days
when
she
contended
against
all
the
rest
of
greece
as
well
as
against
the
barbarian
but
there
was
no
achievement
and
no
display
of
courage
on
your
part
so
prodigious
that
other
cities
can
not
in
their
turn
rival
it
for
they
too
wrought
some
such
deeds
in
alliance
with
you
and
some
on
their
own
account
and
that
i
may
not
by
recalling
these
and
then
balancing
them
be
thought
either
to
pay
more
honour
to
one
state
than
to
another
in
the
matters
in
which
they
are
your
rivals
or
to
praise
less
than
they
deserve
those
who
proved
inferior
in
order
to
gain
an
advantage
after
the
manner
of
rhetoricians
i
desire
to
bring
forward
on
your
behalf
only
this
fact
to
which
i
can
discover
nothing
that
can
be
set
against
it
on
the
part
of
the
other
greek
states
and
which
has
been
assigned
to
you
by
ancient
tradition
when
the
lacedaemonians
were
in
power
you
took
that
power
away
from
them
not
by
violence
but
by
your
reputation
for
justice
and
it
was
your
laws
that
nurtured
aristides
the
just
moreover
brilliant
as
were
these
proofs
of
your
virtue
you
confirmed
them
by
still
more
brilliant
actions
for
to
be
reputed
just
might
perhaps
happen
to
any
individual
even
though
it
were
not
true
perhaps
it
would
not
be
surprising
that
among
many
worthless
citizens
there
should
be
found
one
virtuous
man
for
even
among
the
medes
is
not
a
certain
deioces
celebrated
and
abaris
too
among
the
hyperboreans
and
anacharsis
among
the
scythians
and
in
their
case
the
surprising
thing
was
that
born
as
they
were
among
nations
who
knew
nothing
of
justice
they
nevertheless
prized
justice
two
of
them
sincerely
though
the
third
only
pretended
to
do
so
out
of
but
it
would
be
hard
to
find
a
whole
people
and
city
enamoured
of
just
deeds
and
just
words
except
your
own
and
i
wish
to
remind
you
of
one
out
of
very
many
such
deeds
done
in
your
city
after
the
persian
war
themistocles
was
planning
to
introduce
a
resolution
to
set
fire
secretly
to
the
naval
arsenals
of
the
greeks
and
then
did
not
dare
to
propose
it
to
the
assembly
but
he
agreed
to
confide
the
secret
to
any
one
man
whom
the
people
should
elect
by
vote
and
the
people
chose
aristides
to
represent
them
but
he
when
he
heard
the
scheme
did
not
reveal
what
he
had
been
told
but
reported
to
the
people
that
there
could
be
nothing
more
profitable
or
more
dishonest
than
that
advice
whereupon
the
city
at
once
voted
against
it
and
rejected
it
very
nobly
by
zeus
and
as
it
behoved
men
to
do
who
are
nurtured
under
the
eyes
of
the
most
wise
goddess

then
if
this
was
your
conduct
of
old
and
from
that
day
to
this
there
is
kept
alive
some
small
spark
as
it
were
of
the
virtue
of
your
ancestors
it
is
natural
that
you
should
pay
attention
not
to
the
magnitude
merely
of
any
performance
nor
whether
a
man
has
travelled
over
the
earth
with
incredible
speed
and
unwearied
energy
as
though
he
had
flown
through
the
air
but
that
you
should
rather
consider
whether
one
has
accomplished
this
feat
by
just
means
and
then
if
he
seems
to
act
with
justice
you
will
perhaps
all
praise
him
both
in
public
and
private
but
if
he
have
slighted
justice
he
will
naturally
be
scorned
by
you
for
there
is
nothing
so
closely
akin
to
wisdom
as
justice
therefore
those
who
slight
her
you
will
justly
expel
as
showing
impiety
towards
the
goddess
who
dwells
among
you
for
this
reason
i
wish
to
report
my
conduct
to
you
though
indeed
you
know
it
well
in
order
that
if
there
is
anything
you
do
not
it
is
likely
that
some
things
you
do
not
and
those
in
fact
which
it
is
most
important
for
all
men
to
be
aware
may
become
known
to
you
and
through
you
to
the
rest
of
the
greeks
therefore
let
no
one
think
that
i
am
trifling
and
wasting
words
if
i
try
to
give
some
account
of
things
that
have
happened
as
it
were
before
the
eyes
of
all
men
not
only
long
ago
but
also
just
lately
for
i
wish
none
to
be
ignorant
of
anything
that
concerns
me
and
naturally
everyone
can
not
know
every
circumstance
first
i
will
begin
with
my
ancestors

that
on
the
father

i
am
descended
from

constantius
on

is
well
known
our
fathers
were
brothers
sons
of
the
same
father
and
close
kinsmen
as
we
were
how
this
most
humane
emperor
treated
us
six
of
my
cousins
and
his
and
my
father
who
was
his
own
uncle
and
also
another
uncle
of
both
of
us
on
the
father
s
side
and
my
eldest
brother
he
put
to
death
without
a
trial
and
as
for
me
and
my
other
brother
he
intended
to
put
us
to
death
but
finally
inflicted
exile
upon
us
and
from
that
exile
he
released
me
but
him
he
stripped
of
the
title
of
caesar
just
before
he
murdered
him
but
why
should
i
recount
as
though
from
some
tragedy
all
these
unspeakable
horrors
for
he
has
repented
i
am
told
and
is
stung
by
remorse
and
he
thinks
that
his
unhappy
state
of
childlessness
is
due
to
those
deeds
and
his
ill
success
in
the
persian
war
he
also
ascribes
to
that
cause
this
at
least
was
the
gossip
of
the
court
at
the
time
and
of
those
who
were
about
the
person
of
my
brother
gallus
of
blessed
memory
who
is
now
for
the
first
time
so
styled
for
after
putting
him
to
death
in
defiance
of
the
laws
he
neither
suffered
him
to
share
the
tombs
of
his

granted
him

i
said
they
kept
telling
us
and
tried
to
convince
us
that
constantius
had
acted
thus
partly
because
he
was
deceived
and
partly
because
he
yielded
to
the
violence
and
tumult
of
an
undisciplined
and
mutinous
army
this
was
the
strain
they
kept
up
to
soothe
us
when
we
had
been
imprisoned
in
a
certain
farm
in
cappadocia
and
they
allowed
no
one
to
come
near
us
after
they
had
summoned
him
from
exile
in
tralles

had
dragged
me
from
the
schools

i
was

boy

shall

six
years
we
spent
there

we
lived

on

estate
of
a
stranger

were
watched
as
though
we
were
in
some
persian
garrison
since
no
stranger
came
to
see
us
and
not
one
of
our
old
friends
was
allowed
to
visit
us
so
that
we
lived
shut
off
from
every
liberal
study
and
from
all
free
intercourse
in
a
glittering
servitude
and
sharing
the
exercises
of
our
own
slaves

they
were
comrades
for
no

of
our
own

came

from
that
place
barely
and
by
the
help
of
the
gods
i
was
set
free
and
for
a
happier
fate
but
my
brother
was
imprisoned
at
court
and
his
fate
was
above
all
men
who
have
ever
yet
lived
and
indeed
whatever
cruelty
or
harshness
was
revealed
in
his
disposition
was
increased
by
his
having
been
brought
up
among
those
mountains
it
is
therefore
i
think
only
just
that
the
emperor
should
bear
the
blame
for
this
also
he
who
against
our
will
allotted
to
us
that
sort
of
as
for
me
the
gods
by
means
of
philosophy
caused
me
to
remain
untouched
by
it
and
unharmed
but
on
my
brother
no
one
bestowed
this
boon
for
when
he
had
come
straight
from
the
country
to
the
court
the
moment
that
constantius
had
invested
him
with
the
purple
robe
he
at
once
began
to
be
jealous
of
him
nor
did
he
cease
from
that
feeling
until
not
content
with
stripping
him
of
the
purple
he
had
destroyed
him
yet
surely
he
deserved
to
live
even
if
he
seemed
unfit
to
govern
but
someone
may
say
that
it
was
necessary
to
deprive
him
of
life
also
i
admit
it
only
on
condition
that
he
had
first
been
allowed
to
speak
in
his
own
defence
as
criminals
are
for
surely
it
is
not
the
case
that
the
law
forbids
one
who
has
imprisoned
bandits
to
put
them
to
death
but
says
that
it
is
right
to
destroy
without
a
trial
those
who
have
been
stripped
of
the
honours
that
they
possessed
and
have
become
mere
individuals
instead
of
rulers
for
what
if
my
brother
had
been
able
to
expose
those
who
were
responsible
for
his
errors
for
there
had
been
handed
to
him
the
letters
of
certain
persons
and
by
heracles
what
accusations
against
himself
they
contained
and
in
his
resentment
at
these
he
gave
way
in
most
unkingly
fashion
to
uncontrolled
anger
but
he
had
done
nothing
to
deserve
being
deprived
of
life
itself
what
is
not
this
a
universal
law
among
all
greeks
and
barbarians
alike
that
one
should
defend
oneself
against
those
who
take
the
initiative
in
doing
one
a
wrong
i
admit
that
he
did
perhaps
defend
himself
with
too
great
cruelty
but
on
the
whole
not
more
cruelly
than
might
have
been
expected
for
we
have
heard
it
said
before
that
an
enemy
may
be
expected
to
harm
one
in
a
fit
of
anger
but
it
was
to
gratify
a
eunuch
his
chamberlain
who
was
also
his
chief
cook
that
constantius
gave
over
to
his
most
inveterate
enemies
his
own
cousin
the
caesar
his
sister
s
husband
the
father
of
his
niece
the
man
whose
own
sister
he
had
himself
married
in
earlier
days
and
to
whom
he
owed
so
many
obligations
connected
with
the
gods
of
the
family
as
for
me
he
reluctantly
let
me
go
after
dragging
me
hither
and
thither
for
seven
whole
months
and
keeping
me
under
guard
so
that
had
not
some
one
of
the
gods
desired
that
i
should
escape
and
made
the
beautiful
and
virtuous
eusebia
kindly
disposed
to
me
i
could
not
then
have
escaped
from
his
hands
myself
and
yet
i
call
the
gods
to
witness
that
my
brother
had
pursued
his
course
of
action
without
my
having
a
sight
of
him
even
in
a
dream
for
i
was
not
with
him
nor
did
i
visit
him
or
travel
to
his
neighbourhood
and
i
used
to
write
to
him
very
seldom
and
on
unimportant
matters
thinking
therefore
that
i
had
escaped
from
that
place
i
set
out
for
the
house
that
had
been
my
mother
s
for
of
my
father
s
estate
nothing
belonged
to
me
and
i
had
acquired
out
of
the
great
wealth
that
had
naturally
belonged
to
my
father
not
the
smallest
clod
of
earth
not
a
slave
not
a
house
for
the
admirable
constantius
had
inherited
in
my
place
the
whole
of
my
father
s
property
and
to
me
as
i
was
saying
he
granted
not
the
least
trifle
of
it
moreover
though
he
gave
my
brother
a
few
things
that
had
been
his
father
s
he
robbed
him
of
the
whole
of
his
mother
s
estate

now
his

the
most
galling
and
irksome
have
heard
if
not
every
detail
still
the
greater
part
as
i
was
saying
i
was
on
my
way
to
my
home
and
was
barely
getting
away
safely
beyond
my
hopes
when
a
certain
sycophant
turned
up
near
sirmium
and
fabricated
the
rumour
against
certain
persons
there
that
they
were
planning
a
revolt
you
certainly
know
by
hearsay
africanus
and
marinus
nor
can
you
fail
to
have
heard
of
felix
and
what
was
the
fate
of
those
men
and
when
constantius
was
informed
of
the
matter
and
dynamius
another
sycophant
suddenly
reported
from
gaul
that
silvanus
was
on
the
point
of
declaring
himself
his
open
enemy
in
the
utmost
alarm
and
terror
he
forthwith
sent
to
me
and
first
he
bade
me
retire
for
a
short
time
to
greece
then
summoned
me
from
there
to
the
court
again
he
had
never
seen
me
before
except
once
in
cappadocia
and
once
in
italy
interview
which
eusebia
had
secured
by
her
exertions
so
that
i
might
feel
confidence
about
my
personal
safety
and
yet
i
lived
for
six
months
in
the
same
city
as
he
did
and
he
had
promised
that
he
would
see
me
again
but
that
execrable
eunuch
his
trusty
chamberlain
unconsciously
and
involuntarily
proved
himself
my
benefactor
for
he
did
not
allow
me
to
meet
the
emperor
often
nor
perhaps
did
the
latter
desire
it
still
the
eunuch
was
the
chief
reason
for
what
he
dreaded
was
that
if
we
had
any
intercourse
with
one
another
i
might
be
taken
into
favour
and
when
my
loyalty
became
evident
i
might
be
given
some
place
of
trust

the

through
the
eunuchs

household

a
little
later
when
the
emperor
the
affair
of
silvanus
had
been
last
i
was
given
access
to
the
court
and
in
the
words
of
the
proverb
thessalian
persuasion
was
applied
to
me
for
when
i
firmly
declined
all
intercourse
with
the
palace
some
of
them
as
though
they
had
come
together
in
a
barber
s
shop
cut
off
my
beard
and
dressed
me
in
a
military
cloak
and
transformed
me
into
a
highly
ridiculous
soldier
as
they
thought
at
the
time
for
none
of
the
decorations
of
those
villains
suited
me
and
i
walked
not
like
them
staring
about
me
and
strutting
along
but
gazing
on
the
ground
as
i
had
been
trained
to
do
by
the
preceptor
who
brought
me
up
at
the
time
then
i
inspired
their
ridicule
but
a
little
later
their
suspicion
and
then
their
jealousy
was
inflamed

my

what
happened
was
somewhat
as
follows
when
i
came
to
milan
i
resided
in
one
of
the
suburbs
thither
eusebia
sent
me
on
several
occasions
messages
of
and
urged
me
to
write
to
her
without
hesitation
about
anything
that
i
desired
accordingly
i
wrote
her
a
letter
or
rather
a
petition
containing
vows
like
these
may
you
have
children
to
succeed
you
may
god
grant
you
this
and
that
if
only
you
send
me
home
as
quickly
as
possible
but
i
suspected
that
it
was
not
safe
to
send
to
the
palace
letters
addressed
to
the
emperor
s
wife
therefore
i
besought
the
gods
to
inform
me
at
night
whether
i
ought
to
send
the
letter
to
the
empress
and
they
warned
me
that
if
i
sent
it
i
should
meet
the
most
ignominious
death
i
call
all
the
gods
to
witness
that
what
i
write
here
is
true
for
this
reason
therefore
i
forbore
to
send
the
letter
but
from
that
night
there
kept
occurring
to
me
an
argument
which
it
is
perhaps
worth
your
while
also
to
hear
now
i
said
to
myself
i
am
planning
to
oppose
the
gods
and
i
have
imagined
that
i
can
devise
wiser
schemes
for
myself
than
those
who
know
all
things
and
yet
human
wisdom
which
looks
only
to
the
present
moment
may
be
thankful
if
with
all
its
efforts
it
succeed
in
avoiding
mistakes
even
for
a
short
space
that
is
why
no
man
takes
thought
for
things
that
are
to
happen
thirty
years
hence
or
for
things
that
are
already
past
for
the
one
is
superfluous
the
other
impossible
but
only
for
what
lies
near
at
hand
and
has
already
some
beginnings
and
germs
but
the
wisdom
of
the
gods
sees
very
far
or
rather
sees
the
whole
and
therefore
it
directs
aright
and
brings
to
pass
what
is
best
for
they
are
the
causes
of
all
that
now
is
and
so
likewise
of
all
that
is
to
be
wherefore
it
is
reasonable
that
they
should
have
knowledge
about
the
so
far
then
it
seemed
to
me
that
on
this
reasoning
my
second
determination
was
wiser
than
my
first
and
viewing
the
matter
in
the
light
of
justice
i
immediately
reflected
would
you
not
be
provoked
if
one
of
your
own
beasts
were
to
deprive
you
of
its
services
or
were
even
to
run
away
when
you
called
it
a
horse
or
sheep
or
calf
as
the
case
might
be
and
will
you
who
pretended
to
be
a
man
and
not
even
a
man
of
the
common
herd
or
from
the
dregs
of
the
people
but
one
belonging
to
the
superior
and
reasonable
class
deprive
the
gods
of
your
service
and
not
trust
yourself
to
them
to
dispose
of
you
as
they
please
beware
lest
you
not
only
fall
into
great
folly
but
also
neglect
your
proper
duties
towards
the
gods
where
is
your
courage
and
of
what
sort
is
it
a
sorry
thing
it
seems
at
any
rate
you
are
ready
to
cringe
and
flatter
from
fear
of
death
and
yet
it
is
in
your
power
to
lay
all
that
aside
and
leave
it
to
the
gods
to
work
their
will
dividing
with
them
the
care
of
yourself
as
socrates
for
instance
chose
to
do
and
you
might
while
doing
such
things
as
best
you
can
commit
the
whole
to
their
charge
seek
to
possess
nothing
seize
nothing
but
accept
simply
what
is
vouchsafed
to
you
by
and
this
course
i
thought
was
not
only
safe
but
becoming
to
a
reasonable
man
since
the
response
of
the
gods
had
suggested
it
for
to
rush
headlong
into
unseemly
and
foreseen
danger
while
trying
to
avoid
future
plots
seemed
to
me
a
procedure
accordingly
i
consented
to
yield
and
immediately
i
was
invested
with
the
title
and
robe
of
caesar
the
slavery
that
ensued
and
the
fear
for
my
very
life
that
hung
over
me
every
day
heracles
how
great
it
was
and
how
terrible
my
doors
locked
warders
to
guard
them
the
hands
of
my
servants
searched
lest
one
of
them
should
convey
to
me
the
most
trifling
letter
from
my
friends
strange
servants
to
wait
on
me
only
with
difficulty
was
i
able
to
bring
with
me
to
court
four
of
my
own
domestics
for
my
personal
service
two
of
them
mere
boys
and
two
older
men
of
whom
only
one
knew
of
my
attitude
to
the
gods
and
as
far
as
he
was
able
secretly
joined
me
in
their
worship
i
had
entrusted
with
the
care
of
my
books
since
he
was
the
only
one
with
me
of
many
loyal
comrades
and
friends
a
certain
physician
who
had
been
allowed
to
leave
home
with
me
because
it
was
not
known
that
he
was
my
friend
and
this
state
of
things
caused
me
such
alarm
and
i
was
so
apprehensive
about
it
that
though
many
of
my
friends
really
wished
to
visit
me
i
very
reluctantly
refused
them
admittance
for
though
i
was
most
anxious
to
see
them
i
shrank
from
bringing
disaster
upon
them
and
myself
at
the
same
time
but
this
is
somewhat
foreign
to
my
narrative
the
following
relates
to
the
actual
course
of
events

gave

three

and
in
the
middle
of
the
winter
despatched
me
into
gaul
which
was
then
in
a
state
of
great
disorder
and
i
was
sent
not
as
commander
of
the
garrisons
there
but
rather
as
a
subordinate
of
the
generals

stationed

been

orders
given

were

all
this
had
happened
in

manner

described
about
the
summer
solstice
he
allowed
me
to
join
the
army
and
to
carry
about
with
me
his
dress
and

and
indeed
he
had
both
said
and
written
that
he
was
not
giving
the
gauls
a
king
but
one
who
should
convey
to
them
his
image

κύριος
now
when
as
you
have
heard
the
first
campaign
was
ended
that
year
and
great
advantage
gained
i
returned
to
winter
quarters
and
there
i
was
exposed
to
the
utmost
danger
for
i
was
not
even
allowed
to
assemble
the
troops
this
power
was
entrusted
to
another
while
i
was
quartered
apart
with
only
a
few
soldiers
and
then
since
the
neighbouring
towns
begged
for
my
assistance
i
assigned
to
them
the
greater
part
of
the
force
that
i
had
and
so
i
myself
was
left
isolated
this
then
was
the
condition
of
affairs
at
that
time
and
when
the
of
the
forces
fell
under
the
suspicions
of
constantius
and
was
deprived
by
him
of
his
command
and
superseded
i
in
my
turn
was
thought
to
be
by
no
means
capable
or
talented
as
a
general
merely
because
i
had
shown
myself
mild
and
moderate
for
i
thought
i
ought
not
to
fight
against
my
yoke
or
interfere
with
the
general
in
command
except
when
in
some
very
dangerous
undertaking
i
saw
either
that
something
was
being
overlooked
or
that
something
was
being
attempted
that
ought
never
to
have
been
attempted
at
all
but
after
certain
persons
had
treated
me
with
disrespect
on
one
or
two
occasions
i
decided
that
for
the
future
i
ought
to
show
my
own
respect
by
keeping
silence
and
henceforth
i
contented
myself
with
parading
the
imperial
robe
and
the
image
for
i
thought
that
to
these
at
any
rate
i
had
been
given
a
right

nearest
to
us
were
as
much
as
three
hundred
stades
from
the
banks
of
the
rhine
and
a
district
three
times
as
wide
as
that
had
been
left
a
desert
by
their
raids
so
that
the
gauls
could
not
even
pasture
their
cattle
there
then
too
there
were
certain
cities
deserted
by
their
inhabitants
near
which
the
barbarians
were
not
yet
encamped
this
then
was
the
condition
of
gaul
when
i
took
it
over
i
recovered
the
city
of
agrippina
on
the
rhine
which
had
been
taken
about
ten
months
earlier
and
also
the
neighbouring
fort
of
argentoratum
near
the
of
the
vosges
mountains
and
there
i
engaged
the
enemy
not
ingloriously
it
may
be
that
the
fame
of
that
battle
has
reached
even
your
ears
there
though
the
gods
gave
into
my
hands
as
prisoner
of
war
the
king
of
the
enemy
i
did
not
begrudge
constantius
the
glory
of
that
success
and
yet
though
i
was
not
allowed
to
triumph
for
it
i
had
it
in
my
power
to
slay
my
enemy
and
moreover
i
could
have
led
him
through
the
whole
of
gaul
and
exhibited
him
to
the
cities
and
thus
have
luxuriated
as
it
were
in
the
misfortunes
of
chnodomar
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
do
none
of
these
things
but
sent
him
at
once
to
constantius
who
was
returning
from
the
country
of
the
quadi
and
the
sarmatians
so
it
came
about
that
though
i
had
done
all
the
fighting
and
he
had
only
travelled
in
those
parts
and
held
friendly
intercourse
with
the
tribes
who
dwell
on
the
borders
of
the
danube
it
was
not
i
but
he
who
triumphed

then
followed
the
second
and
third
years
of
that
campaign
and
by
that
time
all
the
barbarians
had
been
driven
out
of
gaul
most
of
the
towns
had
been
recovered
and
a
whole
fleet
of
many
ships
had
arrived
from
britain
i
had
collected
a
fleet
of
six
hundred
ships
four
hundred
of
which
i
had
had
built
in
less
than
ten
months
and
i
brought
them
all
into
the
rhine
no
slight
achievement
on
account
of
the
neighbouring
barbarians
who
kept
attacking
me
at
least
it
seemed
so
impossible
to
florentius
that
he
had
promised
to
pay
the
barbarians
a
fee
of
two
thousand
pounds
weight
of
silver
in
return
for
a
passage
constantius
when
he
learned
florentius
had
informed
him
about
the
proposed
to
me
to
carry
out
the
agreement
unless
i
thought
it
absolutely
disgraceful
but
how
could
it
fail
to
be
disgraceful
when
it
seemed
so
even
to
constantius
who
was
only
too
much
in
the
habit
of
trying
to
conciliate
the
barbarians
however
no
payment
was
made
to
them
instead
i
marched
against
them
and
since
the
gods
protected
me
and
were
present
to
aid
i
received
the
submission
of
part
of
the
salian
tribe
and
drove
out
the
chamavi
and
took
many
cattle
and
women
and
children
and
i
so
terrified
them
all
and
made
them
tremble
at
my
approach
that
i
immediately
received
hostages
from
them
and
secured
a
safe
passage
for
my

it
would
take
too
long
to
enumerate
everything
and
to
write
down
every
detail
of
the
task
that
i
accomplished
within
four
years
but
to
sum
it
all
up
three
times
while
i
was
still
caesar
i
crossed
the
rhine
one
thousand
persons
who
were
held
as
captives
on
the
further
side
of
the
rhine
i
demanded
and
received
back
in
two
battles
and
one
siege
i
took
captive
ten
thousand
prisoners
and
those
not
of
unserviceable
age
but
men
in
the
prime
of
life
i
sent
to
constantius
four
levies
of
excellent
infantry
three
more
of
infantry
not
so
good
and
two
very
distinguished
squadrons
of
cavalry
i
have
now
with
the
help
of
the
gods
recovered
all
the
towns
and
by
that
time
i
had
already
recovered
almost
forty
i
call
zeus
and
all
the
gods
who
protect
cities
and
our
race
to
bear
witness
as
to
my
behaviour
towards
constantius
and
my
loyalty
to
him
and
that
i
behaved
to
him
as
i
would
have
chosen
that
my
own
son
should
behave
to
me
i
have
paid
him
more
honour
than
any
caesar
has
paid
to
any
emperor
in
the
past
indeed
to
this
very
day
he
has
no
accusation
to
bring
against
me
on
that
score
though
i
have
been
entirely
frank
in
my
dealings
with
him
but
he
invents
absurd
pretexts
for
his
resentment
he
says
you
have
detained
lupicinus
and
three
other
and
supposing
i
had
even
put
them
to
death
after
they
had
openly
plotted
against
me
he
ought
for
the
sake
of
keeping
peace
to
have
renounced
his
resentment
at
their
fate
but
i
did
those
men
not
the
least
injury
and
i
detained
them
because
they
are
by
nature
quarrelsome
and
and
though
i
am
spending
large
sums
of
the
public
money
on
them
i
have
robbed
them
of
none
of
their
property
observe
how
constantius
really
lays
down
the
law
that
i
ought
to
proceed
to
extremities
with
such
men
for
by
his
anger
on
behalf
of
men
who
are
not
related
to
him
at
all
does
he
not
rebuke
and
ridicule
me
for
my
folly
in
having
served
so
faithfully
the
murderer
of
my
father
my
brothers
my
cousins
the
executioner
as
it
were
of
his
and
my
whole
family
and
kindred
consider
too
with
what
deference
i
have
continued
to
treat
him
even
since
i
became
emperor
as
is
shown
in
my
letters

and
how
i
behaved
to
him
before
that
you
shall
now
learn
since
i
was
well
aware
that
whenever
mistakes
were
made
i
alone
should
incur
the
disgrace
and
danger
though
most
of
the
work
was
carried
on
by
others
i
first
of
all
implored
him
if
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
that
course
and
was
altogether
determined
to
proclaim
me
caesar
to
give
me
good
and
able
men
to
assist
me
he
however
at
first
gave
me
the
vilest
wretches
and
when
one
the
most
worthless
of
them
had
very
gladly
accepted
and
no
one
of
the
others
consented
he
gave
me
with
a
bad
grace
an
officer
who
was
indeed
excellent
sallust
who
on
account
of
his
virtue
has
at
once
fallen
under
his
suspicion
and
since
i
was
not
satisfied
with
such
an
arrangement
and
saw
how
his
manner
to
them
varied
for
i
observed
that
he
trusted
one
of
them
too
much
and
paid
no
attention
at
all
to
the
other
i
clasped
his
right
hand
and
his
knees
and
said
i
have
no
acquaintance
with
any
of
these
men
nor
have
had
in
the
past
but
i
know
them
by
report
and
since
you
bid
me
i
regard
them
as
my
comrades
and
friends
and
pay
them
as
much
respect
as
i
would
to
old
acquaintances
nevertheless
it
is
not
just
that
my
affairs
should
be
entrusted
to
them
or
that
their
fortunes
should
be
hazarded
with
mine
what
then
is
my
petition
give
me
some
sort
of
written
rules
as
to
what
i
must
avoid
and
what
you
entrust
to
me
to
perform
for
it
is
clear
that
you
will
approve
of
him
who
obeys
you
and
punish
him
who
is
disobedient
though
indeed
i
am
very
sure
that
no
one
will
disobey

i
need
not
mention
the
innovations
that
pentadius
at
once
tried
to
introduce
but
i
kept
opposing
him
in
everything
and
for
that
reason
he
became
my
enemy
then
constantius
chose
another
and
a
second
and
a
third
and
fashioned
them
for
his
purpose
i
mean
paul
and
gaudentius
those
notorious
sycophants
he
hired
them
to
attack
me
and
then
took
measures
to
remove
sallust
because
he
was
my
friend
and
to
appoint
lucilianus
immediately
as
his
successor
and
a
little
later
florentius
also
became
my
enemy
on
account
of
his
avarice
which
i
used
to
oppose
these
men
persuaded
constantius
who
was
perhaps
already
somewhat
irritated
by
jealousy
of
my
successes
to
remove
me
altogether
from
command
of
the
troops
and
he
wrote
letters
full
of
insults
directed
against
me
and
threatening
ruin
to
the
gauls
for
he
gave
orders
for
the
withdrawal
from
gaul
of
i
might
almost
say
the
whole
of
the
most
efficient
troops
without
exception
and
assigned
this
commission
to
lupicinus
and
gintonius
while
to
me
he
wrote
that
i
must
oppose
them
in
nothing

and
now
in
what
terms
shall
i
describe
to
you
the
work
of
the
gods
it
was
my
intention
as
they
will
bear
me
witness
to
divest
myself
of
all
imperial
splendour
and
state
and
remain
in
peace
taking
no
part
whatever
in
affairs
but
i
waited
for
florentius
and
lupicinus
to
arrive
for
the
former
was
at
vienne
the
latter
in
britain
meanwhile
there
was
great
excitement
among
the
civilians
and
the
troops
and
someone
wrote
an
anonymous
letter
to
the
town
near
where
i
was
addressed
to
the
petulantes
and
the
were
the
names
of
the
of
invectives
against
constantius
and
of
lamentations
about
his
betrayal
of
the
gauls
moreover
the
author
of
the
letter
lamented
bitterly
the
disgrace
inflicted
on
myself
this
letter
when
it
arrived
provoked
all
those
who
were
most
definitely
on
the
side
of
constantius
to
urge
me
in
the
strongest
terms
to
send
away
the
troops
at
once
before
similar
letters
could
be
scattered
broadcast
among
the
rest
of
the
legions
and
indeed
there
was
no
one
there
belonging
to
the
party
supposed
to
be
friendly
to
me
but
only
nebridius
pentadius
and
decentius
the
latter
of
whom
had
been
despatched
for
this
very
purpose
by
constantius
and
when
i
replied
that
we
ought
to
wait
still
longer
for
lupicinus
and
florentius
no
one
listened
to
me
but
they
all
declared
that
we
ought
to
do
the
very
opposite
unless
i
wished
to
add
this
further
proof
and
evidence
for
the
suspicions
that
were
already
entertained
about
me
and
they
added
this
argument
if
you
send
away
the
troops
now
it
will
be
regarded
as
your
measure
but
when
the
others
come
constantius
will
give
them
not
you
the
credit
and
you
will
be
held
to
and
so
they
persuaded
or
rather
compelled
me
to
write
to
him
for
he
alone
may
be
said
to
be
persuaded
who
has
the
power
to
refuse
but
those
who
can
use
force
have
no
need
to
persuade
as
well
then
again
where
force
is
used
there
is
no
persuasion
but
a
man
is
the
victim
of
necessity
thereupon
we
discussed
by
which
road
since
there
were
two
the
troops
had
better
march
i
preferred
that
they
should
take
one
of
these
but
they
immediately
compelled
them
to
take
the
other
for
fear
that
the
other
route
if
chosen
should
give
rise
to
mutiny
among
the
troops
and
cause
some
disturbance
and
that
then
when
they
had
once
begun
to
mutiny
they
might
throw
all
into
confusion
indeed
such
apprehension
on
their
part
seemed
not
altogether
without
grounds

the
legions
arrived
and
i
as
was
customary
went
to
meet
them
and
exhorted
them
to
continue
their
march
for
one
day
they
halted
and
till
that
time
i
knew
nothing
whatever
of
what
they
had
determined
i
call
to
witness
zeus
helios
ares
athene
and
all
the
other
gods
that
no
such
suspicion
even
entered
my
mind
until
that
very
evening
it
was
already
late
when
about
sunset
the
news
was
brought
to
me
and
suddenly
the
palace
was
surrounded
and
they
all
began
to
shout
aloud
while
i
was
still
considering
what
i
ought
to
do
and
feeling
by
no
means
confident
my
wife
was
still
alive
and
it
happened
that
in
order
to
rest
alone
i
had
gone
to
the
upper
room
near
hers
then
from
there
through
an
opening
in
the
wall
i
prayed
to
zeus
and
when
the
shouting
grew
still
louder
and
all
was
in
a
tumult
in
the
palace
i
entreated
the
god
to
give
me
a
sign
and
thereupon
he
showed
me
a
sign
and
bade
me
yield
and
not
oppose
myself
to
the
will
of
the
army
nevertheless
even
after
these
tokens
had
been
vouchsafed
to
me
i
did
not
yield
without
reluctance
but
resisted
as
long
as
i
could
and
would
not
accept
either
the
salutation
or
the
diadem
but
since
i
could
not
singlehanded
control
so
many
and
moreover
the
gods
who
willed
that
this
should
happen
spurred
on
the
soldiers
and
gradually
softened
my
resolution
somewhere
about
the
third
hour
some
soldier
or
other
gave
me
the
collar
and
i
put
it
on
my
head
and
returned
to
the
palace
as
the
gods
know
groaning
in
my
heart
and
yet
surely
it
was
my
duty
to
feel
confidence
and
to
trust
in
the
god
after
he
had
shown
me
the
sign
but
i
was
terribly
ashamed
and
ready
to
sink
into
the
earth
at
the
thought
of
not
seeming
to
obey
constantius
faithfully
to
the
last

now
since
there
was
the
greatest
consternation
in
the
palace
the
friends
of
constantius
thought
they
would
seize
the
occasion
to
contrive
a
plot
against
me
without
delay
and
they
distributed
money
to
the
soldiers
expecting
one
of
two
things
either
that
they
would
cause
dissension
between
me
and
the
troops
or
no
doubt
that
the
latter
would
attack
me
openly
but
when
a
certain
officer
belonging
to
those
who
commanded
my
wife
s
escort
perceived
that
this
was
being
secretly
contrived
he
first
reported
it
to
me
and
then
when
he
saw
that
i
paid
no
attention
to
him
he
became
frantic
and
like
one
possessed
he
began
to
cry
aloud
before
the
people
in
the
fellow
soldiers
strangers
and
citizens
do
not
abandon
the
emperor
then
the
soldiers
were
inspired
by
a
frenzy
of
rage
and
they
all
rushed
to
the
palace
under
arms
and
when
they
found
me
alive
in
their
delight
like
men
who
meet
friends
whom
they
had
not
hoped
to
see
again
they
pressed
round
me
on
this
side
and
on
that
and
embraced
me
and
carried
me
on
their
shoulders
and
it
was
a
sight
worth
seeing
for
they
were
like
men
seized
with
a
divine
frenzy
then
after
they
had
surrounded
me
on
all
sides
they
demanded
that
i
give
up
to
them
for
punishment
the
friends
of
constantius
what
fierce
opposition
i
had
to
fight
down
in
my
desire
to
save
those
persons

all

i

i

myself

i
have
persuaded
the

to
demand
nothing
more
if
only
he
would
allow
us
to
dwell
peaceably
in

and
would
ratify
what
has
been

done
all
the

sent
letters
to

praying
that
there
might
be

instead
of
this
he
let
loose
against
us
the

among
them
proclaimed
me
his
foe
and
paid
them
bribes
so
that
the
people
of
the

might
be
laid
waste
moreover
he
wrote
to
the
forces
in

and
bade

be

against
any
who
should
come
from

and

to
be
got
ready
three
million
bushels
of
wheat
which
had
been
ground
at
brigantia
and
the
same
amount
near
the
cottian
alps
with
the
intention
of
marching
to
oppose
me
these
are
not
mere
words
but
deeds
that
speak
plain
in
fact
the
letters
that
he
wrote
i
obtained
from
the
barbarians
who
brought
them
to
me
and
i
seized
the
provisions
that
had
been
made
ready
and
the
letters
of
taurus
besides
even
now
in
his
letters
he
addresses
me
as
caesar
and
declares
that
he
will
never
make
terms
with
me
but
he
sent
one
epictetus
a
bishop
of
gaul
to
offer
a
guarantee
for
my
personal
safety
and
throughout
his
letters
he
keeps
repeating
that
he
will
not
take
my
life
but
about
my
honour
he
says
not
a
word
as
for
his
oaths
for
my
part
i
think
they
should
as
the
proverb
says
be
written
in
ashes
so
little
do
they
inspire
belief
but
my
honour
i
will
not
give
up
partly
out
of
regard
for
what
is
seemly
and
fitting
but
also
to
secure
the
safety
of
my
friends
and
i
have
not
yet
described
the
cruelty
that
he
is
practising
over
the
whole
earth

these
then
were
the
events
that
persuaded
me
this
was
the
conduct
i
thought
just
and
first
i
imparted
it
to
the
gods
who
see
and
hear
all
things
then
when
i
had
offered
sacrifices
for
my
departure
the
omens
were
favourable
on
that
very
day
on
which
i
was
about
to
announce
to
the
troops
that
they
were
to
march
to
this
place
and
since
it
was
not
only
on
behalf
of
my
own
safety
but
far
more
for
the
sake
of
the
general
welfare
and
the
freedom
of
all
men
and
in
particular
of
the
people
of
gaul
twice
already
he
had
betrayed
them
to
the
enemy
and
had
not
even
spared
the
tombs
of
their
ancestors
he
who
is
so
anxious
to
conciliate
strangers
i
say
i
thought
that
i
ought
to
add
to
my
forces
certain
very
powerful
tribes
and
to
obtain
supplies
of
money
which
i
had
a
perfect
right
to
coin
both
gold
and
silver
moreover
if
even
now
he
would
welcome
a
reconciliation
with
me
i
would
keep
to
what
i
at
present
possess
but
if
he
should
decide
to
go
to
war
and
will
in
no
wise
relent
from
his
earlier
purpose
then
i
ought
to
do
and
to
suffer
whatever
is
the
will
of
the
gods
seeing
that
it
would
be
more
disgraceful
to
show
myself
his
inferior
through
failure
of
courage
or
lack
of
intelligence
than
in
mere
numbers
for
if
he
now
defeats
me
by
force
of
numbers
that
will
not
be
his
doing
but
will
be
due
to
the
larger
army
that
he
has
at
his
command
if
on
the
other
hand
he
had
surprised
me
loitering
in
gaul
and
clinging
to
bare
life
and
while
i
tried
to
avoid
the
danger
had
attacked
me
on
all
sides
in
the
rear
and
on
the
flanks
by
means
of
the
barbarians
and
in
front
by
his
own
legions
i
should
i
believe
have
had
to
face
complete
ruin
and
moreover
the
disgrace
of
such
conduct
is
greater
than
any
least
in
the
sight
of
the

fragment
of
a
letter
to
a
priest
introduction
julian
was
supreme
pontiff
and
as
such
felt
responsible
for
the
teachings
and
conduct
of
the
priesthood
he
saw
that
in
order
to
offset
the
influence
of
the
christian
priests
which
he
thought
was
partly
due
to
their
moral
teaching
partly
to
their
charity
towards
the
poor
the
pagans
must
follow
their
example
hitherto
the
preaching
of
morals
had
been
left
to
the
philosophers
julian
s
admonitions
as
to
the
treatment
of
the
poor
and
of
those
in
prison
and
the
rules
that
he
lays
down
for
the
private
life
of
a
priest
are
evidently
borrowed
from
the
christians
this
fragment
occurs
in
the
vossianus
inserted
in
the
letter
to
themistius
and
was
identified
and
published
separately
by

there
are
also
who
though
man
is
naturally
a
social
and

being
seek
out
desert
places
instead
of

since
they
have
been
given
over
to
evil
demons
and
are
led
by
them
into
this
hatred
of
their
kind

many
of

have

devised

such

does

you
must
above
all
exercise
philanthropy
for
from
it
result
many
other
blessings
and
moreover
that
choicest
and
greatest
blessing
of
all
the
good
will
of
the
gods
for
just
as
those
who
are
in
agreement
with
their
masters
about
their
friendships
and
ambitions
and
loves
are
more
kindly
treated
than
their
fellow
slaves
so
we
must
suppose
that
god
who
naturally
loves
human
beings
has
more
kindness
for
those
men
who
love
their
fellows
now
philanthropy
has
many
divisions
and
is
of
many
kinds
for
instance
it
is
shown
when
men
are
punished
in
moderation
with
a
view
to
the
betterment
of
those
punished
as
schoolmasters
punish
children
and
again
in
ministering
to
men
s
needs
even
as
the
gods
minister
to
our
own
you
see
all
the
blessings
of
the
earth
that
they
have
granted
to
us
food
of
all
sorts
and
in
an
abundance
that
they
have
not
granted
to
all
other
creatures
put
together
and
since
we
were
born
naked
they
covered
us
with
the
hair
of
animals
and
with
things
that
grow
in
the
ground
and
on
trees
nor
were
they
content
to
do
this
simply
or
as
moses
tells
us
men
took
coats
of
skins
but
you
see
how
numerous
are
the
gifts
of
athene
the
craftswoman
what
other
animals
use
wine
or
olive
oil
except
indeed
in
cases
where
we
let
them
share
in
these
things
even
though
we
do
not
share
them
with
our
fellowmen
what
creature
of
the
sea
uses
corn
what
land
animal
uses
things
that
grow
in
the
sea
and
i
have
not
yet
mentioned
gold
and
bronze
and
iron
though
in
all
these
the
the
gods
have
made
us
very
rich
yet
not
to
the
end
that
we
may
bring
reproach
on
them
by
disregarding
the
poor
who
go
about
in
our
midst
especially
when
they
happen
to
be
of
good
for
instance
who
have
inherited
no
paternal
estate
and
are
poor
because
in
the
greatness
of
their
souls
they
have
no
desire
for
money
now
the
crowd
when
they
see
such
men
blame
the
gods
however
it
is
not
the
gods
who
are
to
blame
for
their
poverty
but
rather
the
insatiate
greed
of
us
men
of
property
becomes
the
cause
of
this
false
conception
of
the
gods
among
men
and
besides
of
unjust
blame
of
the
gods
of
what
use
i
ask
is
it
for
us
to
pray
that
god
will
rain
gold
on
the
poor
as
he
did
on
the
people
of
rhodes
for
even
though
this
should
come
to
pass
we
should
forthwith
set
our
slaves
underneath
to
catch
it
and
put
out
vessels
everywhere
and
drive
off
all
comers
so
that
we
alone
might
seize
upon
the
gifts
of
the
gods
meant
for
all
in
common
and
anyone
would
naturally
think
it
strange
if
we
should
ask
for
this
which
is
not
in
the
nature
of
things
and
is
in
every
way
unprofitable
while
we
do
not
do
what
is
in
our
power
who
i
ask
ever
became
poor
by
giving
to
his
neighbours
indeed
i
myself
who
have
often
given
lavishly
to
those
in
need
have
recovered
my
gifts
again
many
times
over
at
the
hands
of
the
gods
though
i
am
a
poor
man
of
business
nor
have
i
ever
repented
of
that
lavish
giving
and
of
the
present
time
i
will
say
nothing
for
it
would
be
altogether
irrational
of
me
to
compare
the
expenditure
of
private
persons
with
that
of
an
emperor
but
when
i
was
myself
still
a
private
person
i
know
that
this
happened
to
me
many
times
my
grandmother
s
estate
for
instance
was
kept
for
me
untouched
though
others
had
taken
possession
of
it
by
violence
because
from
the
little
that
i
had
i
spent
money
on
those
in
need
and
gave
them
a
share

we
ought
then
to
share
our
money
with
all
men
but
more
generously
with
the
good
and
with
the
helpless
and
poor
so
as
to
suffice
for
their
need
and
i
will
assert
even
though
it
be
paradoxical
to
say
so
that
it
would
be
a
pious
act
to
share
our
clothes
and
food
even
with
the
wicked
for
it
is
to
the
humanity
in
a
man
that
we
give
and
not
to
his
moral
character
hence
i
think
that
even
those
who
are
shut
up
in
prison
have
a
right
to
the
same
sort
of
care
since
this
kind
of
philanthropy
will
not
hinder
justice
for
when
many
have
been
shut
up
in
prison
to
await
trial
of
whom
some
will
be
found
guilty
while
others
will
prove
to
be
innocent
it
would
be
harsh
indeed
if
out
of
regard
for
the
guiltless
we
should
not
bestow
some
pity
on
the
guilty
also
or
again
if
on
account
of
the
guilty
we
should
behave
ruthlessly
and
inhumanly
to
those
also
who
have
done
no
wrong
this
too
when
i
consider
it
seems
to
me
altogether
wrong
i
mean
that
we
call
zeus
by
the
title
god
of
strangers
while
we
show
ourselves
more
inhospitable
to
strangers
than
are
the
very
scythians
how
i
ask
can
one
who
wishes
to
sacrifice
to
zeus
the
god
of
strangers
even
approach
his
temple
with
what
conscience
can
he
do
so
when
he
has
forgotten
the
saying

again
the
man
who
worships
zeus
the
god
of
comrades
and
who
though
he
sees
his
neighbours
in
need
of
money
does
not
give
them
even
so
much
as
a
drachma
how
i
say
can
he
think
that
he
is
worshipping
zeus
aright
when
i
observe
this
i
am
wholly
amazed
since
i
see
that
these
titles
of
the
gods
are
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
their
express
images
yet
in
our
practice
we
pay
no
attention
to
anything
of
the
sort
the
gods
are
called
by
us
gods
of
kindred
and
zeus
the
god
of
kindred
but
we
treat
our
kinsmen
as
though
they
were
strangers
i
say
kinsmen
because
every
man
whether
he
will
or
no
is
akin
to
every
other
man
whether
it
be
true
as
some
say
that
we
are
all
descended
from
one
man
and
one
woman
or
whether
it
came
about
in
some
other
way
and
the
gods
created
us
all
together
at
the
first
when
the
world
began
not
one
man
and
one
woman
only
but
many
men
and
many
women
at
once
for
they
who
had
the
power
to
create
one
man
and
one
woman
were
able
to
create
many
men
and
women
at
once
since
the
manner
of
creating
one
man
and
one
woman
is
the
same
as
that
of
creating
many
men
and
many
women
and
one
must
have
regard
to
the
differences
in
our
habits
and
laws
or
still
more
to
that
which
is
higher
and
more
precious
and
more
authoritative
i
mean
the
sacred
tradition
of
the
gods
which
has
been
handed
down
to
us
by
the
theurgists
of
earlier
days
namely
that
when
zeus
was
setting
all
things
in
order
there
fell
from
him
drops
of
sacred
blood
and
from
them
as
they
say
arose
the
race
of
men
it
follows
therefore
that
we
are
all
kinsmen
whether
many
men
and
women
as
we
are
we
come
from
two
human
beings
or
whether
as
the
gods
tell
us
and
as
we
ought
to
believe
since
facts
bear
witness
thereto
we
are
all
descended
from
the
gods
and
that
facts
bear
witness
that
many
men
came
into
the
world
at
once
i
shall
maintain
elsewhere
and
precisely
but
for
the
moment
it
will
be
enough
to
say
this
much
that
if
we
were
descended
from
one
man
and
one
woman
it
is
not
likely
that
our
laws
would
show
such
great
divergence
nor
in
any
case
is
it
likely
that
the
whole
earth
was
filled
with
people
by
one
man
nay
not
even
if
the
women
used
to
bear
many
children
at
a
time
to
their
husbands
like
swine
but
when
the
gods
all
together
had
given
birth
to
men
just
as
one
man
came
forth
so
in
like
manner
came
forth
many
men
who
had
been
allotted
to
the
gods
who
rule
over
births
and
they
brought
them
forth
receiving
their
souls
from
the
demiurge
from
eternity

it
is
proper
also
to
bear
in
mind
how
many
discourses
have
been
devoted
by
men
in
the
past
to
show
that
man
is
by
nature
a
social
animal
and
shall
we
after
asserting
this
and
enjoining
it
bear
ourselves
unsociably
to
our
neighbours
then
let
everyone
make
the
basis
of
his
conduct
moral
virtues
and
actions
like
these
namely
reverence
towards
the
gods
benevolence
towards
men
personal
chastity
and
thus
let
him
abound
in
pious
acts
i
mean
by
endeavouring
always
to
have
pious
thoughts
about
the
gods
and
by
regarding
the
temples
and
images
of
the
gods
with
due
honour
and
veneration
and
by
worshipping
the
gods
as
though
he
saw
them
actually
present
for
our
fathers
established
images
and
altars
and
the
maintenance
of
undying
fire
and
generally
speaking
everything
of
the
sort
as
symbols
of
the
presence
of
the
gods
not
that
we
may
regard
such
things
as
gods
but
that
we
may
worship
the
gods
through
them
for
since
being
in
the
body
it
was
in
bodily
wise
that
we
must
needs
perform
our
service
to
the
gods
also
though
they
are
themselves
without
bodies
they
therefore
revealed
to
us
in
the
earliest
images
the
class
of
gods
next
in
rank
to
the
first
even
those
that
revolve
in
a
circle
about
the
whole
heavens
but
since
not
even
to
these
can
due
worship
be
offered
in
bodily
they
are
by
nature
not
in
need
of
anything
class
of
images
was
invented
on
the
earth
and
by
performing
our
worship
to
them
we
shall
make
the
gods
propitious
to
ourselves
for
just
as
those
who
make
offerings
to
the
statues
of
the
emperors
who
are
in
need
of
nothing
nevertheless
induce
goodwill
towards
themselves
thereby
so
too
those
who
make
offerings
to
the
images
of
the
gods
though
the
gods
need
nothing
do
nevertheless
thereby
persuade
them
to
help
and
to
care
for
them
for
zeal
to
do
all
that
is
in
one
s
power
is
in
truth
a
proof
of
piety
and
it
is
evident
that
he
who
abounds
in
such
zeal
thereby
displays
a
higher
degree
of
piety
whereas
he
who
neglects
what
is
possible
and
then
pretends
to
aim
at
what
is
impossible
evidently
does
not
strive
after
the
impossible
since
he
overlooks
the
possible
for
even
though
god
stands
in
need
of
nothing
it
does
not
follow
that
on
that
account
nothing
ought
to
be
offered
to
him
he
does
not
need
the
reverence
that
is
paid
in
words
what
then
is
it
rational
to
deprive
him
of
this
also
by
no
means
it
follows
then
that
one
ought
not
to
deprive
him
either
of
the
honour
that
is
paid
to
him
through
deeds
an
honour
which
not
three
years
or
three
thousand
years
have
ordained
but
all
past
time
among
all
the
nations
of
the
earth

therefore
when
we
look
at
the
images
of
the
gods
let
us
not
indeed
think
they
are
stones
or
wood
but
neither
let
us
think
they
are
the
gods
themselves
and
indeed
we
do
not
say
that
the
statues
of
the
emperors
are
mere
wood
and
stone
and
bronze
but
still
less
do
we
say
they
are
the
emperors
themselves
he
therefore
who
loves
the
emperor
delights
to
see
the
emperor
s
statue
and
he
who
loves
his
son
delights
to
see
his
son
s
statue
and
he
who
loves
his
father
delights
to
see
his
father
s
statue
it
follows
that
he
who
loves
the
gods
delights
to
gaze
on
the
images
of
the
gods
and
their
likenesses
and
he
feels
reverence
and
shudders
with
awe
of
the
gods
who
look
at
him
from
the
unseen
world
therefore
if
any
man
thinks
that
because
they
have
once
been
called
likenesses
of
the
gods
they
are
incapable
of
being
destroyed
he
is
it
seems
to
me
altogether
foolish
for
surely
in
that
case
they
were
incapable
of
being
made
by
men
s
hands
but
what
has
been
made
by
a
wise
and
good
man
can
be
destroyed
by
a
bad
and
ignorant
man
but
those
beings
which
were
fashioned
by
the
gods
as
the
living
images
of
their
invisible
nature
i
mean
the
gods
who
revolve
in
a
circle
in
the
heavens
abide
imperishable
for
all
time
therefore
let
no
man
disbelieve
in
gods
because
he
sees
and
hears
that
certain
persons
have
profaned
their
images
and
temples
have
they
not
in
many
cases
put
good
men
to
death
like
socrates
and
dio
and
the
great
empedotimus
and
yet
i
am
very
sure
that
the
gods
cared
more
for
these
men
than
for
the
temples
but
observe
that
since
they
knew
that
the
bodies
even
of
these
men
were
destructible
they
allowed
them
to
yield
to
nature
and
to
submit
but
later
on
they
exacted
punishment
from
their
slayers
and
this
has
happened
in
the
sight
of
all
in
our
own
day
also
in
the
case
of
all
who
have
profaned
the
temples

therefore
let
no
man
deceive
us
with
his
sayings
or
trouble
our
faith
in
a
divine
providence
for
as
for
those
who
make
such
profanation
a
reproach
against
us
i
mean
the
prophets
of
the
jews
what
have
they
to
say
about
their
own
temple
which
was
overthrown
three
times
and
even
now
is
not
being
raised
up
again
this
i
mention
not
as
a
reproach
against
them
for
i
myself
after
so
great
a
lapse
of
time
intended
to
restore
it
in
honour
of
the
god
whose
name
has
been
associated
with
it
but
in
the
present
case
i
have
used
this
instance
because
i
wish
to
prove
that
nothing
made
by
man
can
be
indestructible
and
that
those
prophets
who
wrote
such
statements
were
uttering
nonsense
due
to
their
gossiping
with
silly
old
women
in
my
opinion
there
is
no
reason
why
their
god
should
not
be
a
mighty
god
even
though
he
does
not
happen
to
have
wise
prophets
or
interpreters
but
the
real
reason
why
they
are
not
wise
is
that
they
have
not
submitted
their
souls
to
be
cleansed
by
the
regular
course
of
study
nor
have
they
allowed
those
studies
to
open
their
tightly
closed
eyes
and
to
clear
away
the
mist
that
hangs
over
them
but
since
these
men
see
as
it
were
a
great
light
through
a
fog
not
plainly
or
clearly
and
since
they
think
that
what
they
see
is
not
a
pure
light
but
a
fire
and
they
fail
to
discern
all
that
surrounds
it
they
cry
with
a
loud
voice
tremble
be
afraid
fire
flame
death
a
dagger
a
thus
describing
under
many
names
the
harmful
might
of

but
on
this
subject
it
will
be
better
to
demonstrate
separately
how
much
inferior
to
our
own
poets
are
these
teachers
of
tales
about
the
gods

it
is
our
duty
to
adore
not
only
the
images
of
the
gods
but
also
their
temples
and
sacred
precincts
and
altars
and
it
is
reasonable
to
honour
the
priests
also
as
officials
and
servants
of
the
gods
and
because
they
minister
to
us
what
concerns
the
gods
and
they
lend
strength
to
the
gods
gift
of
good
things
to
us
for
they
sacrifice
and
pray
on
behalf
of
all
men
it
is
therefore
right
that
we
should
pay
them
all
not
less
if
not
indeed
more
than
the
honours
that
we
pay
to
the
magistrates
of
the
state
and
if
any
one
thinks
that
we
ought
to
assign
equal
honours
to
them
and
to
the
magistrates
of
the
state
since
the
latter
also
are
in
some
sort
dedicated
to
the
service
of
the
gods
as
being
guardians
of
the
laws
nevertheless
we
ought
at
any
rate
to
give
the
priests
a
far
greater
share
of
our
good
will
the
achaeans
for
instance
enjoined
on
their
king
to
reverence
the
priest
though
he
was
one
of
the
enemy
whereas
we
do
not
even
reverence
the
priests
who
are
our
friends
and
who
pray
and
sacrifice
on
our
behalf

but
since
my
discourse
has
come
back
again
to
the
beginning
as
i
have
so
long
wished
i
think
it
is
worth
while
for
me
to
describe
next
in
order
what
sort
of
man
a
priest
ought
to
be
in
order
that
he
may
justly
be
honoured
himself
and
may
cause
the
gods
to
be
honoured
for
as
for
us
we
ought
not
to
investigate
or
enquire
as
to
his
conduct
but
so
long
as
a
man
is
called
a
priest
we
ought
to
honour
and
cherish
him
but
if
he
prove
to
be
wicked
we
ought
to
allow
his
priestly
office
to
be
taken
away
from
him
since
he
has
shown
himself
unworthy
of
it
but
so
long
as
he
sacrifices
for
us
and
makes
offerings
and
stands
in
the
presence
of
the
gods
we
must
regard
him
with
respect
and
reverence
as
the
most
highly
honoured
chattel
of
the
gods
for
it
would
be
absurd
for
us
to
pay
respect
to
the
very
stones
of
which
the
altars
are
made
on
account
of
their
being
dedicated
to
the
gods
because
they
have
a
certain
shape
and
form
suited
to
the
ritual
for
which
they
have
been
fashioned
and
then
not
to
think
that
we
ought
to
honour
a
man
who
has
been
dedicated
to
the
gods
perhaps
someone
will
but
suppose
he
does
wrong
and
often
fails
to
offer
to
the
gods
their
sacred
rites
then
indeed
i
answer
that
we
ought
to
convict
a
man
of
that
sort
so
that
he
may
not
by
wickedness
offend
the
gods
but
that
we
ought
not
to
dishonour
him
until
he
has
been
convicted
nor
indeed
is
it
reasonable
that
when
we
have
set
our
hands
to
this
business
we
should
take
away
their
honour
not
only
from
these
offenders
but
also
from
those
who
are
worthy
to
be
honoured
then
let
every
priest
like
every
magistrate
be
treated
with
respect
since
there
is
also
an
oracle
to
that
effect
from
the
didymaean
god

now
though
there
are
many
utterances
of
the
god
to
the
same
effect
by
means
of
which
we
may
learn
to
honour
and
cherish
priests
as
we
ought
i
shall
speak
on
this
subject
elsewhere
at
greater
length
but
for
the
present
it
is
enough
to
point
out
that
i
am
not
inventing
anything
offhand
since
i
think
that
the
declaration
made
by
the
god
and
the
injunction
expressed
in
his
own
words
are
sufficient
therefore
let
any
man
who
considers
that
as
a
teacher
of
such
matters
i
am
worthy
to
be
believed
show
due
respect
to
the
god
and
obey
him
and
honour
the
priests
of
the
gods
above
all
other
men
and
now
i
will
try
to
describe
what
sort
of
man
a
priest
himself
ought
to
be
though
not
for
your
especial
benefit
for
if
i
did
not
already
know
from
the
evidence
both
of
the
high
priest
and
of
the
most
mighty
gods
that
you
administer
this
priestly
office
least
all
matters
that
come
under
your
should
not
have
ventured
to
confide
to
you
a
matter
so
important
but
i
do
so
in
order
that
you
may
be
able
from
what
i
say
to
instruct
the
other
priests
not
only
in
the
cities
but
in
the
country
districts
also
more
convincingly
and
with
complete
freedom
since
not
of
your
own
self
do
you
alone
devise
these
precepts
and
practise
them
but
you
have
me
also
to
give
you
support
who
by
the
grace
of
the
gods
am
known
as
sovereign
pontiff
though
i
am
indeed
by
no
means
worthy
of
so
high
an
office
though
i
desire
and
moreover
constantly
pray
to
the
gods
that
i
may
be
worthy
for
the
gods
you
must
know
hold
out
great
hopes
for
us
after
death
and
we
must
believe
them
absolutely
for
they
are
always
truthful
not
only
about
the
future
life
but
about
the
affairs
of
this
life
also
and
since
in
the
superabundance
of
their
power
they
are
able
both
to
overcome
the
confusion
that
exists
in
this
life
and
to
regulate
its
disorders
and
irregularities
will
they
not
all
the
more
in
that
other
life
where
conflicting
things
are
reconciled
after
the
immortal
soul
has
been
separated
from
the
body
and
the
lifeless
body
has
turned
to
earth
be
able
to
bestow
all
those
things
for
which
they
have
held
out
hopes
to
mankind
therefore
since
we
know
that
the
gods
have
granted
to
their
priests
a
great
recompense
let
us
make
them
responsible
in
all
things
for
men
s
esteem
of
the
gods
displaying
their
own
lives
as
an
example
of
what
they
ought
to
preach
to
the
people

the
first
thing
we
ought
to
preach
is
reverence
towards
the
gods
for
it
is
fitting
that
we
should
perform
our
service
to
the
gods
as
though
they
were
themselves
present
with
us
and
beheld
us
and
though
not
seen
by
us
could
direct
their
gaze
which
is
more
powerful
than
any
light
even
as
far
as
our
hidden
thoughts
and
this
saying
is
not
my
own
but
the
god
s
and
has
been
declared
in
many
utterances
but
for
me
surely
it
is
sufficient
by
bringing
forth
one
such
utterance
to
illustrate
two
things
in
one
namely
how
the
gods
see
all
things
and
how
they
rejoice
in
fearing
men

the

and
related
to
the
gods
so
much
the
more
is
it
likely
that
the
gaze
of
the
gods
should
penetrate
through
his
soul
easily
and
effectively
and
observe
the
love
of
the
god
for
mankind
when
he
says
that
he
delights
in
the
disposition
of
men
as
much
as
in
olympus
most
pure
and
bright
how
then
shall
he
not
lead
up
our
souls
from
the
darkness
and
from
tartarus
if
we
approach
him
with
pious
awe
and
indeed
he
has
knowledge
even
of
those
who
have
been
imprisoned
in
not
even
that
region
falls
outside
the
power
of
the
gods
to
the
he
promises
olympus
instead
of
tartarus
wherefore
we
ought
by
all
means
to
hold
fast
to
deeds
of
piety
approaching
the
gods
with
reverence
and
neither
saying
nor
listening
to
anything
base
and
the
priests
ought
to
keep
themselves
pure
not
only
from
impure
or
shameful
acts
but
also
from
uttering
words
and
hearing
speeches
of
that
character
accordingly
we
must
banish
all
offensive
jests
and
all
licentious
intercourse
and
that
you
may
understand
what
i
mean
by
this
let
no
one
who
has
been
consecrated
a
priest
read
either
archilochus
or
hipponax
or
anyone
else
who
writes
such
poems
as
theirs
and
in
old
comedy
let
him
avoid
everything
of
that
it
is
better
indeed
on
all
accounts
philosophy
alone
will
be
appropriate
for
us
priests
and
of
philosophers
only
those
who
chose
the
gods
as
guides
of
their
mental
discipline
like
pythagoras
and
plato
and
aristotle
and
the
school
of
chrysippus
and
zeno
for
we
ought
not
to
give
heed
to
them
all
nor
to
the
doctrines
of
all
but
only
to
those
philosophers
and
those
of
their
doctrines
that
make
men
and
teach
concerning
the
gods
first
that
they
exist
secondly
that
they
concern
themselves
with
the
things
of
this
world
and
further
that
they
do
no
injury
at
all
either
to
mankind
or
to
one
another
out
of
jealousy
or
envy
or
enmity
i
mean
the
sort
of
thing
our
poets
in
the

have
brought
themselves
into
disrepute
by
writing
and
in
the
second
place
such
tales
as
the
prophets
of
the
jews
take
pains
to
invent
and
are
admired
for
so
doing
by
those
miserable
men
who
have
attached
themselves

we

let
us
not
admit
discourses
by
epicurus
or
pyrrho
but
indeed
the
gods
have
already
in
their
wisdom
destroyed
their
works
so
that
most
of
their
books
have
ceased
to
be
nevertheless
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
not
by
way
of
example
mention
these
works
too
to
show
what
sort
of
discourses
priests
must
especially
avoid
and
if
such
discourses
then
much
more
must
they
avoid
such
thoughts
for
an
error
of
speech
is
in
my
opinion
by
no
means
the
same
as
an
error
of
the
mind
but
we
ought
to
give
heed
to
the
mind
first
of
all
since
the
tongue
sins
in
company
with
it
we
ought
to
learn
by
heart
the
hymns
in
honour
of
the
and
beautiful
they
are
composed
by
men
of
old
and
of
our
own
indeed
we
ought
to
try
to
know
also
those
which
are
being
sung
in
the
temples
for
the
greater
number
were
bestowed
on
us
by
the
gods
themselves
in
answer
to
prayer
though
some
few
also
were
written
by
men
and
were
composed
in
honour
of
the
gods
by
the
aid
of
divine
inspiration
and
a
soul
inaccessible
to
things
evil

all
this
at
least
we
ought
to

to
do
and
we
ought
also
to
pray
often
to
the
gods
both
in
private
and
in
public
if
possible
three
times
a
day
but
if
not
so
often
certainly
at
dawn
and
in
the
evening
for
it
is
not
meet
that
a
consecrated
priest
should
pass
a
day
or
a
night
without
sacrifice
and
dawn
is
the
beginning
of
the
day
as
twilight
is
of
the
night
and
it
is
proper
to
begin
both
periods
with
sacrifice
to
the
gods
even
when
we
happen
not
to
be
assigned
to
perform
the
service
for
it
is
our
duty
to
maintain
all
the
ritual
of
the
temples
that
the
law
of
our
fathers
prescribes
and
we
ought
to
perform
neither
more
nor
less
than
that
ritual
for
eternal
are
the
gods
so
that
we
too
ought
to
imitate
their
essential
nature
in
order
that
thereby
we
may
make
them
propitious

now
if
we
were
pure
soul
alone
and
our
bodies
did
not
hinder
us
in
any
respect
it
would
be
well
to
prescribe
one
sort
of
life
for
priests
but
since
what
he
should
practise
when
on
duty
concerns
the
individual
priest
alone
not
priests
absolutely
what
should
we
concede
to
a
man
who
has
received
the
office
of
priest
on
occasions
when
he
is
not
actually
engaged
in
service
in
the
temples
i
think
that
a
priest
ought
to
keep
himself
pure
from
all
contamination
for
a
night
and
a
day
and
then
after
purifying
himself
for
another
night
following
on
the
first
with
such
rites
of
purification
as
the
sacred
laws
prescribe
he
should
under
these
conditions
enter
the
temple
and
remain
there
for
as
many
days
as
the
law
commands
thirty
is
the
number
with
us
at
rome
but
in
other
places
the
number
varies
it
is
proper
then
i
think
that
he
should
remain
throughout
all
these
days
in
the
sacred
precincts
devoting
himself
to
philosophy
and
that
he
should
not
enter
a
house
or
a
or
see
even
a
magistrate
except
in
the
precincts
but
should
concern
himself
with
his
service
to
the
god
overseeing
and
arranging
everything
in
person
and
then
when
he
has
completed
the
term
of
days
he
should
retire
from
his
office
in
favour
of
another
and
when
he
turns
again
to
the
ordinary
life
of
mankind
he
may
be
allowed
to
visit
a
friend
s
house
and
when
invited
to
attend
a
feast
but
not
on
the
invitation
of
all
but
only
of
persons
of
the
highest
character
and
at
this
time
there
would
be
nothing
out
of
the
way
in
his
going
occasionally
to
the
and
conversing
with
the
governor
or
the
chief
magistrate
of
his
tribe
and
giving
aid
as
far
as
lies
in
his
power
to
those
who
have
a
good
reason
for
needing
it

and
it
is
in
my
opinion
fitting
for
priests
to
wear
the
most
magnificent
dress
when
they
are
within
the
temple
performing
the
services
but
when
they
are
outside
the
sacred
precincts
to
wear
ordinary
dress
without
any
extravagance
for
it
is
not
rational
that
we
should
misuse
in
empty
conceit
and
vain
ostentation
what
has
been
given
to
us
for
the
honour
of
the
gods
and
for
this
reason
we
ought
in
the
market
place
to
abstain
from
too
costly
dress
and
from
outward
show
and
in
a
word
from
every
sort
of
pretentiousness
for
consider
how
the
gods
because
they
admired
the
perfect
moderation
of
amphiaraus
after
they
had
decreed
the
destruction
of
that
famous
he
though
he
knew
that
it
would
be
so
went
with
the
expedition
and
therefore
did
not
escape
his
fated
end
gods
i
say
transformed
him
completely
from
what
he
had
been
and
removed
him
to
the
sphere
of
the
gods
for
all
the
others
who
were
in
the
expedition
against
thebes
engraved
a
device
on
their
shields
before
they
had
conquered
the
enemy
and
erected
trophies
to
celebrate
the
downfall
of
the
cadmeans
but
he
the
associate
of
the
gods
when
he
went
to
war
had
arms
with
no
device
but
gentleness
he
had
and
moderation
as
even
the
enemy
bore
witness
hence
i
think
that
we
priests
ought
to
show
moderation
in
our
dress
in
order
that
we
may
win
the
goodwill
of
the
gods
since
it
is
no
slight
offence
that
we
commit
against
them
when
we
wear
in
public
the
sacred
dress
and
make
it
public
property
and
in
a
word
give
all
men
an
opportunity
to
stare
at
it
as
though
it
were
something
marvellous
for
whenever
this
happens
many
who
are
not
purified
come
near
us
and
by
this
means
the
symbols
of
the
gods
are
polluted
moreover
what
lawlessness
it
is
what
arrogance
towards
the
gods
for
us
ourselves
when
we
are
not
living
the
priestly
life
to
wear
the
priestly
dress
however
of
this
too
i
shall
speak

another
place

what
i
am

should
certainly
have

bring

about

as
it
is

i
thought
that
this
is
impossible
and
that
even
if
it
should
prove
to
be
possible
it
would
not
on
other
accounts
be
expedient
i
forebore
entirely
from
this
ambition
but
i
do
demand
that
priests
should
withdraw
themselves
from
the
licentiousness
of
the
theatres
and
leave
them
to
the
crowd
therefore
let
no
priest
enter
a
theatre
or
have
an
actor
or
a
for
his
friend
and
let
no
dancer
or
mime
even
approach
his
door
and
as
for
the
sacred
games
i
permit
anyone
who
will
to
attend
those
only
in
which
women
are
forbidden
not
only
to
compete
but
even
to
be
spectators
with
regard
to
the
hunting
shows
with
dogs
which
are
performed
in
the
cities
inside
the
theatres
need
i
say
that
not
only
priests

even
the
sons
of

must
keep
away

appointed
but
it
is
quite
appropriate
that
my
remarks
should
end
with
this
i
say
that
the
most
upright
men
in
every
city
by
preference
those
who
show
most
love
for
the
gods
and
next
those
who
show
most
love
for
their
fellow
men
must
be
appointed
whether
they
be
poor
or
rich
and
in
this
matter
let
there
be
no
distinction
whatever
whether
they
are
unknown
or
well
known
for
the
man
who
by
reason
of
his
gentleness
has
not
won
notice
ought
not
to
be
barred
by
reason
of
his
want
of
fame
even
though
he
be
poor
and
a
man
of
the
people
if
he
possess
within
himself
these
two
things
love
for
god
and
love
for
his
fellow
men
let
him
be
appointed
priest
and
a
proof
of
his
love
for
god
is
his
inducing
his
own
people
to
show
reverence
to
the
gods
a
proof
of
his
love
for
his
fellows
is
his
sharing
cheerfully
even
from
a
small
store
with
those
in
need
and
his
giving
willingly
thereof
and
trying
to
do
good
to
as
many
men
as
he
is

we
must
pay
especial
attention
to
this
point
and
by
this
means
effect
a
cure
for
when
it
came
about
that
the
poor
were
neglected
and
overlooked
by
the
priests
then
i
think
the
impious
galilaeans
observed
this
fact
and
devoted
themselves
to
philanthropy
and
they
have
gained
ascendancy
in
the
worst
of
their
deeds
through
the
credit
they
win
for
such
practices
for
just
as
those
who
entice
children
with
a
cake
and
by
throwing
it
to
them
two
or
three
times
induce
them
to
follow
them
and
then
when
they
are
far
away
from
their
friends
cast
them
on
board
a
ship
and
sell
them
as
slaves
and
that
which
for
the
moment
seemed
sweet
proves
to
be
bitter
for
all
the
rest
of
their
the
same
method
i
say
the
galilaeans
also
begin
with
their
or
hospitality
or
service
of
tables
they
have
many
ways
of
carrying
it
out
and
hence
call
it
by
many
names
result
is
that
they
have
led
very
many
into
atheism

introduction
the
caesars
otherwise
entitled
in

written
at

was
probably
addressed
to
sallust
to
whom
julian
had
sent

almost
certainly
sallust
caesar
was
in
julian
s
time
a
roman
emperor
s
most
splendid
title
and
was
regularly
used
by
the
barbarians
when
they
referred
to
the
emperor
the
idea
and
the
working
out
of
the
satire
is
lucianic
and
there
are
echoes
here
and
there
of
lucian
s
of
the
but
julian
is
neither
so
witty
nor
so
frivolous
as
lucian
in
speaking
of
the
gods
he
allows
himself
a
licence
which
is
appropriate
to
the
festival
but
would
otherwise
seem
inconsistent
with
the
admonitions
addressed
to
priests
in
the
of

we

ascended
thither
since
we
must
give
romulus
the
name
of
quirinus
in
obedience
to
the

will
for
the
gods
then
the
banquet
had
been
made
ready
there
but
just
below
the
moon
in
the
upper
air
he
had
decided
to
entertain
the
emperors
the
lightness
of
the
bodies
with
which
they
had
been
invested
and
also
the
revolution
of
the
moon
sustained
them
four
couches
were
there
made
ready
for
the
superior
gods
that
of
kronos
was
made
of
gleaming
ebony
which
concealed
in
its
blackness
a
lustre
so
intense
and
divine
that
no
one
could
endure
to
gaze
thereon
for
in
looking
at
that
ebony
the
eyes
suffered
as
much
methinks
from
its
excess
of
radiance
as
from
the
sun
when
one
gazes
too
intently
at
his
disc
the
couch
of
zeus
was
more
brilliant
than
silver
but
paler
than
gold
whether
however
one
ought
to
call
this
electron
or
to
give
it
some
other
name
hermes

not

on

side
of
these
sat
on

thrones
the
mother

beside

beside

for
the
beauty
of
the

even
hermes

said
that
it
transcended
description

must
be
comprehended
by
the
eye
of
the
mind

in
words
it
was
hard
to
portray
and
impossible
to
convey

ears

indeed

there
be

an

every

has

shall
sit
firmly
and
immovably
fixed

though

rise

entrance
of
their
father
they
never
confound
or
change
the
order
of
their
seats

infringe
on

another

since
every
one
knows
his
appointed
place

were
seated

brought
him
up

was
his
tutor

loves
jesting

laughter

is
the
giver

graces
silenus

continual
flow

sarcasms

when
the
banquet
had
been
arranged
for
the
emperors
also
julius
caesar
entered
first
and
such
was
his
passion
for
glory
that
he
seemed
ready
to
contend
with
zeus
himself
for
dominion
whereupon
silenus
observing
him
said
take
care
zeus
lest
this
man
in
his
lust
for
power
be
minded
to
rob
you
of
your
empire
he
is
as
you
see
tall
and
handsome
and
if
he
resembles
me
in
nothing
else
round
about
his
head
he
is
very
like
while
silenus
to
whom
the
gods
paid
very
little
attention
was
jesting
thus
octavian
entered
changing
colour
continually
like
a
chameleon
turning
now
pale
now
red
one
moment
his
expression
was
gloomy
sombre
and
overcast
the
next
he
unbent
and
showed
all
the
charms
of
aphrodite
and
the
graces
moreover
in
the
glances
of
his
eyes
he
was
fain
to
resemble
mighty
helios
for
he
preferred
that
none
who
approached
should
be
able
to
meet
his
gaze
good

exclaimed
silenus
what
a
changeable
monster
is
this
what

he
cried

obeyed
and
thereupon
by
reciting
over
octavian
a
few
of
his
doctrines
in
the
fashion
of
those
who
mutter
the
incantations
of
zamolxis
he
made
him
wise

solemn

said
silenus
in
his
little
island
was
alluding
to
let
him
scratch
the
face
of
that
wretched
while
they
were
still
joking
together
there
came
in
a
fierce
monster
thereupon
all
the
gods
turned
away
their
eyes
from
the
sight
and
next
moment
justice
handed
him
over
to
the
avengers
who
hurled
him
into
tartarus
so
silenus
had
no
chance
to
say
anything
about
him
but
when
claudius
came
in
silenus
began
to
sing
some
verses
from
the
of
aristophanes
toadying
claudius
as
it
seemed
instead
of
demos
then
he
looked
at
quirinus
and
said
quirinus
it
is
not
kind
of
you
to
invite
your
descendant
to
a
banquet
without
his
freedmen
narcissus
and
pallas
come
he
went
on
send
and
fetch
them
and
please
send
too
for
his
spouse
messalina
for
without
them
this
fellow
is
like
a
in
a
tragedy
i
might
almost
say
while
silenus
was
speaking
nero
entered
lyre
in
hand
and
wearing
a
wreath
of
laurel
whereupon
silenus
turned
to
apollo
and
said
you
see
he
models
himself
on
i
will
soon
take
off
that
wreath
replied
apollo
for
he
does
not
imitate
me
in
all
things
and
even
when
he
does
he
does
it
then
his
wreath
was
taken
off
and
cocytus
instantly
swept
him
away

next
entered
an
man
with
a
long
beard
an
adept
in
all
the
arts
but
especially
music
one
who
was
always
gazing
at
the
heavens
and
prying
into
hidden
things
silenus
when
he
saw
him
said
what
think
ye
of
this
sophist
can
he
be
looking
here
for
antinous
one
of
you
should
tell
him
that
the
youth
is
not
here
and
make
him
cease
from
his
madness
and
thereupon
entered
a
man
of
temperate
character
i
do
not
say
in
love
affairs
but
in
affairs
of
state
when
silenus
caught
sight
of
him
he
exclaimed
bah
such
fussing
about
trifles
this
old
man
seems
to
me
the
sort
of
person
who
would
split
cumin
next
entered
the
pair
of
brothers
verus
and
lucius
silenus
scowled
horribly
because
he
could
not
jeer
or
scoff
at
them
especially
not
at
verus
but
he
would
not
ignore
his
errors
of
judgment
in
the
case
of
his
son
and
his
wife
in
that
he
mourned
the
latter
beyond
what
was
becoming
especially
considering
that
she
was
not
even
a
virtuous
woman
and
he
failed
to
see
that
his
son
was
ruining
the
empire
as
well
as
himself
and
that
though
verus
had
an
excellent
who
would
have
administered
the
state
better
and
besides
would
have
managed
the
youth
better
than
he
could
manage
himself
but
though
he
refused
to
ignore
these
errors
he
reverenced
the
exalted
virtue
of
verus
his
son
however
he
considered
not
worth
even
ridicule
and
so
let
him
pass
indeed
he
fell
to
earth
of
his
own
accord
because
he
could
not
keep
on
his
feet
or
accompany
the
heroes

after

alexander
the

sat
down
somewhere
in

loudly
lamented
his

silenus
made
fun
of
him
and
exclaimed
o

you
were
you
could
not
govern
your

gave
your

could

be

much
better
it
was
to
bestow
them
on

to

said

consign
to

who
were

entered

and
his

dragging

came
claudius
at

all
the

gazed
and
admiring
his

granted

entered
probus
who
in
less
than
seven
years
restored
seventy
cities
and
was
in
many
ways
a
wise
administrator
since
he
had
been
unjustly
treated
by
impious
men
the
gods
paid
him
honours
and
moreover
exacted
the
penalty
from
his
assassins
for
all
that
silenus
tried
to
jest
at
his
expense
though
many
of
the
gods
urged
him
to
be
silent
in
spite
of
them
he
called
out
now
let
those
that
follow
him
learn
wisdom
from
his
example
probus
do
you
not
know
that
when
physicians
give
bitter
medicines
they
mix
them
with
honey
but
you
were
always
too
austere
and
harsh
and
never
displayed
toleration
and
so
your
fate
though
unjust
was
natural
enough
for
no
one
can
govern
horses
or
cattle
or
mules
still
less
men
unless
he
sometimes
yields
to
them
and
gratifies
their
wishes
just
as
physicians
humour
their
patients
in
trifles
so
that
they
may
make
them
obey
in
things

while
they
were
talking
carus
and
his
sons
tried
to
slip
into
the
banquet
but
justice
drove
them
away
next
diocletian
advanced
in
pomp
bringing
with
him
the
two
maximians
and
my
grandfather
constantius
these
latter
held
one
another
by
the
hand
and
did
not
walk
alongside
of
diocletian
but
formed
a
sort
of
chorus
round
him
and
when
they
wished
to
run
before
him
as
a
bodyguard
he
prevented
them
since
he
did
not
think
himself
entitled
to
more
privileges
than
they
but
when
he
realised
that
he
was
growing
weary
he
gave
over
to
them
all
the
burdens
that
he
carried
on
his
shoulders
and
thereafter
walked
with
greater
ease
the
gods
admired
their
unanimity
and
permitted
them
to
sit
far
in
front
of
many
of
their
predecessors
maximian
was
so
grossly
intemperate
that
silenus
wasted
no
jests
on
him
and
he
was
not
allowed
to
join
the
emperors
at
their
feast
for
not
only
did
he
indulge
in
vicious
passions
of
all
sorts
but
proved
meddlesome
and
disloyal
and
often
introduced
discord
into
that
harmonious
quartette
justice
therefore
banished
him
without
more
ado
so
he
went
i
know
not
whither
for
i
forgot
to
interrogate
hermes
on
this
point
however
into
that
harmonious
symphony
of
four
there
crept
a
terribly
harsh
and
discordant
strain
for
this
reason
justice
would
not
suffer
the
two
so
much
as
to
approach
the
door
of
that
assembly
of
heroes
as
for
licinius
he
came
as
far
as
the
door
but
as
his
misdeeds
were
many
and
monstrous
minos
forthwith
drove
him
away
constantine
however
entered
and
sat
some
time
and
then
came
his
sons
magnentius
was
refused
admission
because
he
had
never
done
anything
really
laudable
though
much
that
he
achieved
had
the
appearance
of
merit
so
the
gods
who
perceived
that
these
achievements
were
not
based
on
any
virtuous
principle
sent
him
packing
to
his
deep
chagrin

when
the
feast
had
been
prepared
as
i
have
described
the
gods
lacked
nothing
since
all
things
are
theirs
then
hermes
proposed
to
examine
the
heroes
personally
and
zeus
was
of
the
same
mind
quirinus
thereupon
begged
that
he
might
summon
one
of
their
number
to
his
side
quirinus
said
heracles
i
will
not
have
it
for
why
did
you
not
invite
to
the
feast
my
beloved
alexander
also
zeus
if
you
are
minded
to
introduce
into
our
presence
any
of
these
emperors
send
i
beg
of
you
for
alexander
for
if
we
are
to
examine
into
the
merits
of
men
generally
why
do
we
not
throw
open
the
competition
to
the
better
man
zeus
considered
that
what
the
son
of
alcmena
said
was
only
just
so
alexander
joined
the
company
of
heroes
but
neither
caesar
nor
anyone
else
yielded
his
place
to
him
however
he
found
and
took
a
vacant
seat
which
the
son
of
severus
had
taken
for
had
been
expelled
for
fratricide
then
silenus
began
to
rally
quirinus
and
said
see
now
whether
all
these
romans
can
match
this
one
by
zeus
retorted
quirinus
i
consider
that
many
of
them
are
as
good
as
he
it
is
true
that
my
descendants
have
admired
him
so
much
that
they
hold
that
he
alone
of
all
foreign
generals
is
worthy
to
be
styled
the
but
it
does
not
follow
that
they
think
him
greater
than
their
own
heroes
which
may
be
due
to
national
prejudice
but
again
they
may
be
right
however
that
we
shall
very
soon
find
out
by
examining
these
even
as
he
spoke
quirinus
was
blushing
and
was
evidently
extremely
anxious
on
behalf
of
his
descendants
and
feared
that
they
might
come
off
with
the
second
prize

then
zeus
asked
the
gods
whether
it
would
be
better
to
summon
all
the
emperors
to
enter
the
lists
or
whether
they
should
follow
the
custom
of
athletic
contests
which
is
that
he
who
defeats
the
winner
of
many
victories
though
he
overcome
only
that
one
competitor
is
held
thereby
to
have
proved
himself
superior
to
all
who
have
been
previously
defeated
and
that
too
though
they
have
not
wrestled
with
the
winner
but
only
shown
themselves
inferior
to
an
antagonist
who
has
been
defeated
all
the
gods
agreed
that
this
was
a
very
suitable
sort
of
test
hermes
then
summoned
caesar
to
appear
before
them
then
octavian
and
thirdly
trajan
as
being
the
greatest
warriors
in
the
silence
that
followed
kronos
turned
to
zeus
and
said
that
he
was
astonished
to
see
that
only
martial
emperors
were
summoned
to
the
competition
and
not
a
single
philosopher
for
my
part
he
added
i
like
philosophers
just
as
well
so
tell
marcus
to
come
in
accordingly
marcus
was
summoned
and
came
in
looking
excessively
dignified
and
showing
the
effect
of
his
studies
in
the
expression
of
his
eyes
and
his
lined
brows
his
aspect
was
unutterably
beautiful
from
the
very
fact
that
he
was
careless
of
his
appearance
and
unadorned
by
art
for
he
wore
a
very
long
beard
his
dress
was
plain
and
sober
and
from
lack
of
nourishment
his
body
was
very
shining
and
transparent
like
light
most
pure
and
stainless
when
he
too
had
entered
the
sacred
enclosure
dionysus
said
king
kronos
and
father
zeus
can
any
incompleteness
exist
among
the
gods
and
when
they
replied
that
it
could
not
then
said
he
let
us
bring
in
here
some
votary
of
pleasure
as
nay
answered
zeus
it
is
not
permitted
that
any
man
should
enter
here
who
does
not
model
himself
on
in
that
case
said
dionysus
let
them
be
tried
at
the
entrance
let
us
summon
by
your
leave
a
man
not
unwarlike
but
a
slave
to
pleasure
and
enjoyment
let
constantine
come
as
far
as
the
when
this
had
been
agreed
upon
opinions
were
offered
as
to
the
manner
in
which
they
were
to
compete
hermes
thought
that
everyone
ought
to
speak
for
himself
in
turn
and
then
the
gods
should
vote
but
apollo
did
not
approve
of
this
plan
because
he
said
the
gods
ought
to
test
and
examine
the
truth
and
not
plausible
rhetoric
and
the
devices
of
the
orator
zeus
wished
to
please
them
both
and
at
the
same
time
to
prolong
the
assembly
so
he
said
there
is
no
harm
in
letting
them
speak
if
we
measure
them
a
small
allowance
of
water
and
then
later
on
we
can
them
and
test
the
disposition
of
each
whereupon
silenus
said
sardonically
take
care
or
trajan
and
alexander
will
think
it
is
nectar
and
drink
up
all
the
water
and
leave
none
for
the
it
was
not
my
water
retorted
poseidon
but
your
vines
that
these
two
were
fond
of
so
you
had
better
tremble
for
your
vines
rather
than
for
my
silenus
was
greatly
piqued
and
had
no
answer
ready
but
thereafter
turned
his
attention
to
the
disputants
then
hermes
made
this
proclamation

τὸ
πρωτεῖον
while
hermes
had
been
making
this
proclamation
the
lots
were
being
drawn
and
it
happened
that
the
first
lot
favoured
caesar
s
passion
for
being
first
this
made
him
triumphant
and
prouder
than
before
but
the
effect
on
alexander
was
that
he
almost
withdrew
from
the
competition
had
not
mighty
heracles
encouraged
him
and
prevented
him
from
leaving
alexander
drew
the
lot
to
speak
second
but
the
lots
of
those
who
came
next
coincided
with
the
order
in
which
they
had
lived
caesar
then
began
as
follows
it
was
my
fortune
o
zeus
and
ye
other
gods
to
be
born
following
a
number
of
great
men
in
a
city
so
illustrious
that
she
rules
more
subjects
than
any
other
city
has
ever
ruled
and
indeed
other
cities
are
well
pleased
to
rank
as
second
to
her
what
other
city
i
ask
began
with
three
thousand
citizens
and
in
less
than
six
centuries
carried
her
victorious
arms
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
what
other
nations
ever
produced
so
many
brave
and
warlike
men
or
such
lawgivers
what
nation
ever
honoured
the
gods
as
they
did
observe
then
that
though
i
was
born
in
a
city
so
powerful
and
so
illustrious
my
achievements
not
only
surpassed
the
men
of
my
own
day
but
all
the
heroes
who
ever
lived
as
for
my
i
am
confident
that
there
is
none
who
will
challenge
my
superiority
but
if
alexander
here
is
so
presumptuous
which
of
his
deeds
does
he
pretend
to
compare
with
mine
his
persian
conquests
perhaps
as
though
he
had
never
seen
all
those
trophies
that
i
gathered
when
i
defeated
pompey
and
pray
who
was
the
more
skilful
general
darius
or
pompey
which
of
them
led
the
bravest
troops
pompey
had
in
his
army
the
most
martial
of
the
nations
formerly
subject
to
darius
but
he
reckoned
them
no
better
than
carians
for
he
led
also
those
european
forces
which
had
often
repulsed
all
asia
when
she
invaded
europe
aye
and
he
had
the
bravest
of
them
all
italians
illyrians
and
celts
and
since
i
have
mentioned
the
celts
shall
we
compare
the
exploits
of
alexander
against
the
getae
with
my
conquest
of
gaul
he
crossed
the
danube
once
i
crossed
the
rhine
twice
the
german
conquest
again
is
all
my
doing
no
one
opposed
alexander
but
i
had
to
contend
against
ariovistus
i
was
the
first
roman
who
ventured
to
sail
the
outer
sea
perhaps
this
achievement
was
not
so
wonderful
though
it
was
a
daring
deed
that
may
well
command
your
admiration
but
a
more
glorious
action
of
mine
was
when
i
leapt
ashore
from
my
ship
before
all
the
others
of
the
helvetians
and
iberians
i
say
nothing
and
still
i
have
said
not
a
word
about
my
campaigns
in
gaul
when
i
conquered
more
than
three
hundred
cities
and
no
less
than
two
million
men
but
great
as
were
these
achievements
of
mine
that
which
followed
was
still
greater
and
more
daring
for
i
had
to
contend
against
my
fellow
citizens
themselves
and
to
subdue
the
invincible
the
unconquerable
romans
again
if
we
are
judged
by
the
number
of
our
battles
i
fought
three
times
as
many
as
alexander
even
reckoning
by
the
boasts
of
those
who
embellish
his
exploits
if
one
counts
the
cities
captured
i
reduced
the
greatest
number
not
only
in
asia
but
in
europe
as
well
alexander
only
visited
egypt
as
a
but
i
conquered
her
while
i
was
arranging
are
you
pleased
to
inquire
which
of
us
showed
more
clemency
after
victory
i
forgave
even
my
enemies
and
for
what
i
suffered
in
consequence
at
their
hands
justice
has
taken
vengeance
but
alexander
did
not
even
spare
his
friends
much
less
his
enemies
and
are
you
still
capable
of
disputing
the
first
prize
with
me
then
since
you
will
not
like
the
others
yield
place
to
me
you
compel
me
to
say
that
whereas
i
was
humane
towards
the
helvetians
you
treated
the
thebans
cruelly
you
burned
their
cities
to
the
ground
but
i
restored
the
cities
that
had
been
burned
by
their
own
inhabitants
and
indeed
it
was
not
at
all
the
same
thing
to
subdue
ten
thousand
greeks
and
to
withstand
the
onset
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
much
more
could
i
add
both
about
myself
and
alexander
but
i
have
not
had
leisure
to
practise
public
speaking
wherefore
you
ought
to
pardon
me
but
from
what
i
have
said
and
with
regard
to
what
i
have
not
said
you
ought
forming
that
decision
which
equity
and
justice
require
to
award
me

when
caesar
had
spoken
to
this
effect
he
still
wished
to
go
on
talking
but
alexander
who
had
with
difficulty
restrained
himself
hitherto
now
lost
patience
and
with
some
agitation
and
combativeness
but
said
he
o
jupiter
and
ye
other
gods
how
long
must
i
endure
in
silence
the
insolence
of
this
man
there
is
as
you
see
no
limit
to
his
praise
of
himself
or
his
abuse
of
me
it
would
have
better
become
him
perhaps
to
refrain
from
both
since
both
are
alike
insupportable
but
especially
from
disparaging
my
conduct
the
more
since
he
imitated
it
but
he
has
arrived
at
such
a
pitch
of
impudence
that
he
dares
to
ridicule
the
model
of
his
own
exploits
nay
caesar
you
ought
to
have
remembered
those
tears
you
shed
on
hearing
of
the
monuments
that
had
been
consecrated
to
my
glorious
deeds
but
since
then
pompey
has
inflated
you
with
pride
pompey
who
though
he
was
the
idol
of
his
countrymen
was
in
fact
wholly
insignificant
take
his
african
triumph
that
was
no
great
exploit
but
the
feebleness
of
the
consuls
in
office
made
it
seem
glorious
then
the
famous
servile
war
was
waged
not
against
men
but
the
vilest
of
slaves
and
its
successful
issue
was
due
to
others
i
mean
crassus
and
lucius
though
pompey
gained
the
reputation
and
the
credit
for
it
again
armenia
and
the
neighbouring
provinces
were
conquered
by
lucullus
yet
for
these
also
pompey
triumphed
then
he
became
the
idol
of
the
citizens
and
they
called
him
the
greater
i
ask
than
whom
of
his
predecessors
what
achievement
of
his
can
be
compared
with
those
of
marius
or
of
the
two
scipios
or
of
furius
who
sits
over
there
by
quirinus
because
he
rebuilt
his
city
when
it
was
almost
in
ruins
those
men
did
not
make
their
reputation
at
the
expense
of
others
as
happens
with
public
buildings
built
at
the
public
expense
i
mean
that
one
man
lays
the
foundation
another
finishes
the
work
while
the
last
man
who
is
in
office
though
he
has
only
whitewashed
the
walls
has
his
name
inscribed
on
the
building
not
thus
i
repeat
did
those
men
gain
credit
for
the
deeds
of
others
they
were
themselves
the
creators
and
artificers
of
their
schemes
and
deserved
their
illustrious
titles
well
then
it
is
no
wonder
that
you
vanquished
pompey
who
used
to
scratch
his
head
with
his
tip
and
in
all
respects
was
more
of
a
fox
than
a
lion
when
he
was
deserted
by
fortune
who
had
so
long
favoured
him
you
easily
overcame
him
thus
unaided
and
it
is
evident
that
it
was
not
to
any
superior
ability
of
yours
that
you
owed
your
victory
since
after
running
short
of
provisions
small
blunder
for
a
general
to
make
as
i
need
not
tell
fought
a
battle
and
were
beaten
and
if
from
imprudence
or
lack
of
judgment
or
inability
to
control
his
countrymen
pompey
neither
postponed
a
battle
when
it
was
his
interest
to
protract
the
war
nor
followed
up
a
victory
when
he
had
won
it
was
due
to
his
own
errors
that
he
failed
and
not
to
your
strategy

the
persians
on
the
contrary
though
on
all
occasions
they
were
well
and
wisely
equipped
had
to
submit
to
my
valour
and
since
it
becomes
a
virtuous
man
and
a
king
to
pride
himself
not
merely
on
his
exploits
but
also
on
the
justice
of
those
exploits
it
was
on
behalf
of
the
greeks
that
i
took
vengeance
on
the
persians
and
when
i
made
war
on
the
greeks
it
was
not
because
i
wished
to
injure
greece
but
only
to
chastise
those
who
tried
to
prevent
me
from
marching
through
and
from
calling
the
persians
to
account
you
however
while
you
subdued
the
germans
and
gauls
were
preparing
to
fight
against
your
fatherland
what
could
be
worse
or
more
infamous
and
since
you
have
alluded
as
though
insultingly
to
ten
thousand
greeks
i
am
aware
that
you
romans
are
yourselves
descended
from
the
greeks
and
that
the
greater
part
of
italy
was
colonised
by
greeks
however
on
that
fact
i
do
not
insist
but
at
any
rate
did
not
you
romans
think
it
very
important
to
have
as
friends
and
allies
one
insignificant
tribe
of
those
very
greeks
i
mean
the
aetolians
my
neighbours
and
later
when
you
had
gone
to
war
with
them
for
whatever
reason
did
you
not
have
great
trouble
in
making
them
obey
you
well
then
if
in
the
old
age
as
one
may
say
of
greece
you
were
barely
able
to
reduce
not
the
whole
nation
but
an
insignificant
state
which
was
hardly
heard
of
when
greece
was
in
her
prime
what
would
have
happened
to
you
if
you
had
had
to
contend
against
the
greeks
when
they
were
in
full
vigour
and
united
you
know
how
cowed
you
were
when
pyrrhus
crossed
to
invade
you
and
if
you
think
the
conquest
of
persia
such
a
trifle
and
disparage
an
achievement
so
glorious
tell
me
why
after
a
war
of
more
than
three
hundred
years
you
romans
have
never
conquered
a
small
province
beyond
the
tigris
which
is
still
governed
by
the
parthians
shall
i
tell
you
why
it
was
the
arrows
of
the
persians
that
checked
you
ask
antony
to
give
you
an
account
of
them
since
he
was
trained
for
war
by
you
i
on
the
other
hand
in
less
than
ten
years
conquered
not
only
persia
but
india
too
after
that
do
you
dare
to
dispute
the
prize
with
me
who
from
childhood
have
commanded
armies
whose
exploits
have
been
so
glorious
that
the
memory
of
they
have
not
been
worthily
recounted
by
nevertheless
live
for
ever
like
those
of
the
invincible
hero
my
king
whose
follower
i
was
on
whom
i
modelled
myself
achilles
my
ancestor
i
strove
to
rival
but
heracles
i
ever
admired
and
followed
so
far
as
a
mere
man
may
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
a
god

when
alexander
in
his
turn
had
made
his
speech
in
martial
fashion
poseidon
s
attendant
carried
the
to
octavian
but
gave
him
a
smaller
allowance
of
water
partly
because
time
was
precious
but
still
more
because
he
bore
him
a
grudge
for
the
disrespect
he
had
shown
to
the
god
octavian
with
his
usual
sagacity
understood
this
so
without
stopping
to
say
anything
that
did
not
concern
himself
he
began
for
my
part
zeus
and
ye
other
gods
i
shall
not
stay
to
disparage
and
belittle
the
actions
of
others
but
shall
speak
only
of
what
concerns
myself
like
the
noble
alexander
here
i
was
but
a
youth
when
i
was
called
to
govern
my
country
like
caesar
yonder
my
father
i
conducted
successful
campaigns
against
the
germans
when
i
became
involved
in
civil
dissensions
i
conquered
egypt
in
a
off
actium
i
defeated
brutus
and
cassius
at
philippi
the
defeat
of
sextus
pompey
s
son
was
a
mere
incident
in
my
campaign
i
showed
myself
so
gentle
to
the
guidance
of
philosophy
that
i
even
put
up
with
the
plain
speaking
of
athenodorus
and
instead
of
resenting
it
i
was
delighted
with
it
and
revered
the
man
as
my
preceptor
or
rather
as
though
he
were
my
own
father
areius
i
counted
my
friend
and
close
companion
and
in
short
i
was
never
guilty
of
any
offence
against
philosophy
but
since
i
saw
that
more
than
once
rome
had
been
brought
to
the
verge
of
ruin
by
internal
quarrels
i
so
administered
her
affairs
as
to
make
her
strong
as
adamant
for
all
time
unless
indeed
o
ye
gods
you
will
otherwise
for
i
did
not
give
way
to
boundless
ambition
and
aim
at
enlarging
her
empire
at
all
costs
but
assigned
for
it
two
boundaries
defined
as
it
were
by
nature
herself
the
danube
and
the
euphrates
then
after
conquering
the
scythians
and
thracians
i
did
not
employ
the
long
reign
that
you
gods
vouchsafed
me
in
making
projects
for
war
after
war
but
devoted
my
leisure
to
legislation
and
to
reforming
the
evils
that
war
had
caused
for
in
this
i
thought
that
i
was
no
less
well
advised
than
my
predecessors
or
rather
if
i
may
make
bold
to
say
so
i
was
better
advised
than
any
who
have
ever
administered
so
great
an
empire
for
some
of
these
when
they
might
have
remained
quiet
and
not
taken
the
field
kept
making
one
war
an
excuse
for
the
next
like
quarrelsome
people
and
their
lawsuits
and
so
they
perished
in
their
campaigns
others
when
they
had
a
war
on
their
hands
gave
themselves
up
to
indulgence
and
preferred
such
base
indulgence
not
only
to
future
glory
but
even
to
their
personal
safety
when
i
reflect
on
all
this
i
do
not
think
myself
entitled
to
the
lowest
place
but
whatever
shall
seem
good
to
you
o
ye
gods
it
surely
becomes
me
to
accept
with
a
good

was
allowed
to
speak
next
though
he
had
some
talent
for

he
was
so
lazy
that
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
letting
sura
write
most
of
his
speeches
for
him
so
he
shouted
rather
than
spoke
and
meanwhile
displayed
to
the
gods
his
getic
and
parthian
trophies
while
he
accused
his
old
age
of
not
having
allowed
him
to
extend
his
parthian
conquests
you
can
not
take
us
in
said
silenus
you
reigned
twenty
years
and
alexander
here
only
twelve
why
then
do
you
not
put
it
down
to
your
own
love
of
ease
instead
of
complaining
of
your
short
allowance
of
time
stung
by
the
taunt
since
he
was
not
deficient
in
eloquence
though
intemperance
often
made
him
seem
more
stupid
than
he
was
trajan
began
again
o
zeus
and
ye
other
gods
when
i
took
over
the
empire
it
was
in
a
sort
of
lethargy
and
much
disordered
by
the
tyranny
that
had
long
prevailed
at
home
and
by
the
insolent
conduct
of
the
getae
i
alone
ventured
to
attack
the
tribes
beyond
the
danube
and
i
subdued
the
getae
the
most
warlike
race
that
ever
existed
which
is
due
partly
to
their
physical
courage
partly
to
the
doctrines
that
they
have
adopted
from
their
admired
zamolxis
for
they
believe
that
they
do
not
die
but
only
change
their
place
of
abode
and
they
meet
death
more
readily
than
other
men
undertake
a
journey
yet
i
accomplished
that
task
in
a
matter
of
five
years
or
so
that
of
all
the
emperors
who
came
before
me
i
was
regarded
as
the
mildest
in
the
treatment
of
my
subjects
is
i
imagine
obvious
and
neither
caesar
here
nor
any
other
will
dispute
it
with
me
against
the
parthians
i
thought
i
ought
not
to
employ
force
until
they
had
put
themselves
in
the
wrong
but
when
they
did
so
i
marched
against
them
undeterred
by
my
age
though
the
laws
would
have
allowed
me
to
quit
the
service
since
then
the
facts
are
as
i
have
said
do
i
not
deserve
to
be
honoured
before
all
the
rest
first
because
i
was
so
mild
to
my
subjects
secondly
because
more
than
others
i
inspired
terror
in
my
country
s
foes
thirdly
because
i
revered
your
daughter
divine
philosophy
when
trajan
had
finished
this
speech
the
gods
decided
that
he
excelled
all
the
rest
in
clemency
and
evidently
this
was
a
virtue
peculiarly
pleasing
to
them

one
of

and

doctrines
this
stoic
will
but
marcus
turned
to
zeus
and
the
other
gods
and
said
it
seems
to
me
o
zeus
and
ye
other
gods
that
i
have
no
need
to
make
a
speech
or
to
compete
if
you
did
not
know
all
that
concerns
me
it
would
indeed
be
fitting
for
me
to
inform
you
but
since
you
know
it
and
nothing
at
all
is
hidden
from
you
do
you
of
your

assign

such
honour

i
thus

showed

constantine
was
allowed
to
speak
next
on
first
entering
the
lists
he
was
confident
enough
but
when
he
reflected
on
the
exploits
of
the
others
he
saw
that
his
own
were
wholly
trivial
he
had
defeated
two
tyrants
but
to
tell
the
truth
one
of
them
was
untrained
in
war
and
effeminate
the
other
a
poor
creature
and
enfeebled
by
old
age
while
both
were
alike
odious
to
gods
and
men
moreover
his
campaigns
against
the
barbarians
covered
him
with
ridicule
for
he
paid
them
tribute
so
to
speak
while
he
gave
all
his
attention
to
pleasure
who
stood
at
a
distance
from
the
gods
near
the
entrance
to
the
moon
of
her
indeed
he
was
so
enamoured
that
he
had
no
eyes
for
anything
else
and
cared
not
at
all
for
victory
however
as
it
was
his
turn
and
he
had
to
say
something
he
began
in
the
following
respects
i
am
superior
to
these
others
to
the
macedonian
in
having
fought
against
romans
germans
and
scythians
instead
of
asiatic
barbarians
to
caesar
and
octavian
in
that
i
did
not
like
them
lead
a
revolution
against
brave
and
good
citizens
but
attacked
only
the
most
cruel
and
wicked
tyrants
as
for
trajan
i
should
naturally
rank
higher
on
account
of
those
same
glorious
exploits
against
the
tyrants
while
it
would
be
only
fair
to
regard
me
as
his
equal
on
the
score
of
that
territory
which
he
added
to
the
empire
and
i
recovered
if
indeed
it
be
not
more
glorious
to
regain
than
to
gain
as
for
marcus
here
by
saying
nothing
for
himself
he
yields
precedency
to
all
of
but
constantine
said
silenus
are
you
not
offering
us
mere
gardens
of
adonis
as
exploits
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
by
gardens
of
adonis
i
mean
said
silenus
those
that
women
plant
in
pots
in
honour
of
the
lover
of
aphrodite
by
scraping
together
a
little
earth
for
a
garden
bed
they
bloom
for
a
little
space
and
fade
at
this
constantine
blushed
for
he
realised
that
this
was
exactly
like
his
own
performance

silence
was
then
proclaimed
and
the
emperors
thought
they
had
only
to
wait
till
the
gods
decided
to
whom
they
would
vote
the
first
prize
but
the
latter
agreed
that
they
must
bring
to
light
the
motives
that
had
governed
each
and
not
judge
them
by
their
actions
alone
since
fortune
had
the
greatest
share
in
these
that
goddess
herself
was
standing
near
and
kept
reproaching
all
of
them
with
the
single
exception
of
octavian
he
she
said
had
always
been
grateful
to
her
accordingly
the
gods
decided
to
entrust
this
enquiry
also
to
hermes
and
he
was
told
to
begin
with
alexander
and
to
ask
him
what
he
considered
the
finest
of
all
things
and
what
had
been
his
object
in
doing
and
suffering
all
that
he
had
done
and
suffered
to
conquer
the
world
he
replied
well
asked
hermes
do
you
think
you
accomplished
this
i
do
indeed
said
alexander
whereupon
silenus
with
a
malicious
laugh
exclaimed
but
you
were
often
conquered
yourself
by
my
daughters
by
which
he
meant
his
vines
alluding
to
alexander
s
love
of
wine
and
intemperate
habits
but
alexander
was
well
stocked
with
peripatetic
subterfuges
and
retorted
inanimate
things
can
not
conquer
nor
do
we
contend
with
such
but
only
with
the
whole
race
of
men
and
ah
said
silenus
behold
the
chicanery
of
logic
but
tell
me
in
which
class
you
place
yourself
the
inanimate
or
the
animate
and
living
at
this
he
seemed
mortified
and
said
hush
such
my
greatness
of
soul
that
i
was
convinced
that
i
should
become
or
rather
that
i
was
already
a
at
any
rate
said
silenus
you
were
often
defeated
by
nay
retorted
alexander
to
conquer
oneself
or
be
defeated
by
oneself
amounts
to
the
same
thing
i
was
talking
of
my
victories
over
other
no
more
of
your
logic
cried
silenus
how
adroitly
you
detect
my
sophisms
but
when
you
were
wounded
in
india
and
peucestes
lay
near
you
and
they
carried
you
out
of
the
town
at
your
last
gasp
were
you
defeated
by
him
who
wounded
you
or
did
you
conquer
him
i
conquered
him
and
what
is
more
i
sacked
the
town
as
not
you
indeed
you
immortal
said
silenus
for
you
were
lying
like
homer
s
hector
in
a
swoon
and
at
your
last
gasp
it
was
your
soldiers
who
fought
and
well
but
i
led
them
said
alexander
how
so
when
you
were
being
carried
away
almost
dead
and
then
silenus
recited
the
passage
in
euripides
beginning
οἴμοι
ὡς

was

hold
the

in

own

and
neither
to
be
nor
to
be
thought
second
to
any
this
said
hermes
is
not
quite
clear
tell
me
was
it
in
wisdom
that
you
wished
to
be
first
or
in
oratorical
skill
or
in
military
science
or
the
science
of
government
i
should
have
liked
well
said
caesar
to
be
first
of
all
men
in
all
of
these
but
as
i
could
not
attain
to
that
i
sought
to
become
the
most
powerful
of
my
and
did
you
become
so
very
powerful
asked
silenus
certainly
he
replied
since
i
made
myself
their
yes
that
you
were
able
to
do
but
you
could
not
make
yourself
beloved
by
them
though
you
played
the
philanthropic
rôle
as
though
you
were
acting

flattered

all
what

when

punished

that
was
not
for

you
replied
silenus
since
for
that

elected

no
it
was
because
of
the
money
you
left

when

was

still

that
when

i

then
hermes
addressing
trajan
said
now
you
tell
us
what
was
the
principle
that
guided
all
your
actions
my
aims
he
replied
were
the
same
as
alexander
s
but
i
acted
with
more
nay
said
silenus
you
were
the
slave
of
more
ignoble
passions
anger
was
nearly
always
his
weak
point
but
yours
was
pleasure
of
the
vilest
and
most
infamous
plague
take
you
exclaimed
dionysus
you
keep
railing
at
them
all
and
you
don
t
let
them
say
a
word
for
themselves
however
in
their
case
there
was
some
ground
for
your
sarcasms
but
now
consider
well
what
you
can
find
to
criticise
in
marcus
for
in
my
opinion
he
is
a
man
to
quote
simonides
and
made
without
a
then
hermes
addressed
marcus
and
said
and
you
verus
what
did
you
think
the
noblest
ambition
in
life
in
a
low
voice
he
answered
modestly
to
imitate
the
this
answer
they
at
once
agreed
was
highly
noble
and
in
fact
the
best
possible
and
even
hermes
did
not
wish
to
him
further
since
he
was
convinced
that
marcus
would
answer
every
question
equally
well
the
other
gods
were
of
the
same
mind
only
silenus
cried
by
dionysus
i
shall
not
let
this
sophist
off
so
easily
why
then
did
you
eat
bread
and
drink
wine
and
not
ambrosia
and
nectar
like
us
nay
he
replied
it
was
not
in
the
fashion
of
my
meat
and
drink
that
i
thought
to
imitate
the
gods
but
i
nourished
my
body
because
i
believed
though
perhaps
falsely
that
even
your
bodies
require
to
be
nourished
by
the
fumes
of
sacrifice
not
that
i
supposed
i
ought
to
imitate
you
in
that
respect
but
rather
your
for
the
moment
silenus
was
at
a
loss
as
though
he
had
been
hit
by
a
good
boxer
then
he
said
there
is
perhaps
something
in
what
you
say
but
now
tell
me
what
did
you
think
was
really
meant
by
imitating
the
having
the
fewest
possible
needs
and
doing
good
to
the
greatest
possible
do
you
mean
to
say
he
asked
that
you
had
no
needs
at
all
i
said
marcus
had
none
but
my
wretched
body
had
a
few
since
in
this
also
marcus
seemed
to
have
answered
wisely
silenus
was
at
a
loss
but
finally
fastened
on
what
he
thought
was
foolish
and
unreasonable
in
the
emperor
s
behaviour
to
his
son
and
his
wife
i
mean
in
enrolling
the
latter
among
the
deified
and
entrusting
the
empire
to
the
former
but
in
that
also
said
the
other
i
did
but
imitate
the
gods
i
adopted
the
maxim
of
homer
when
he
says
the
good
and
prudent
man
loves
and
cherishes
his
own
wife
while
as
to
my
son
i
can
quote
the
excuse
of
zeus
himself
when
he
is
rebuking
ares
long
ago
he
says
i
should
have
smitten
thee
with
a
thunderbolt
had
i
not
loved
thee
because
thou
art
my
besides
i
never
thought
my
son
would
prove
so
wicked
youth
ever
vacillates
between
the
extremes
of
vice
and
virtue
and
if
in
the
end
he
inclined
to
vice
still
he
was
not
vicious
when
i
entrusted
the
empire
to
him
it
was
only
after
receiving
it
that
he
became
corrupted
therefore
my
behaviour
to
my
wife
was
modelled
on
that
of
the
divine
achilles
and
that
to
my
son
was
in
imitation
of
supreme
zeus
moreover
in
neither
case
did
i
introduce
any
novelty
it
is
the
custom
to
hand
down
the
succession
to
a
man
s
sons
and
all
men
desire
to
do
so
as
for
my
wife
i
was
not
the
first
to
decree
divine
honours
to
a
wife
for
i
followed
the
example
of
many
others
it
is
perhaps
absurd
to
have
introduced
any
such
custom
but
it
would
be
almost
an
injustice
to
deprive
one
s
nearest
and
dearest
of
what
is
now
however
i
forget
myself
when
i
make
this
lengthy
explanation
to
you
o
zeus
and
ye
other
gods
for
ye
know
all
things
forgive

silence
was
proclaimed
and
the

cast
a
secret
ballot
it
turned
out
that
marcus
had
most
of
the
votes
after
conferring
apart
with
his
father
zeus
bade
hermes
make
a
proclamation
as
follows
know
all
ye
mortals
who
have
entered

contest
that
according
to
our
laws

the
victor
is
allowed
to

must
not

depart
then
wherever

live

one
of
you
under
the
guidance
of
the
gods
let
every
man
choose
his
own
guardian
and
after
this
announcement
alexander
hastened
to
heracles
and
octavian
to
apollo
but
marcus
attached
himself
closely
to
zeus
and
kronos
caesar
wandered
about
for
a
long
time
and
ran
hither
and
thither
till
mighty
ares
and
aphrodite
took
pity
on
him
and
summoned
him
to
them
trajan
hastened
to
alexander
and
sat
down
near
him
as
for
constantine
he
could
not
discover
among
the
gods
the
model
of
his
own
career
but
when
he
caught
sight
of
pleasure
who
was
not
far
off
he
ran
to
her
she
received
him
tenderly
and
embraced
him
then
after
dressing
him
in
raiment
of
many
colours
and
otherwise
making
him
beautiful
she
led
him
away
to
incontinence
there
too
he
found
jesus
who
had
taken
up
his
abode
with
her
and
cried
aloud
to
all
comers
he
that
is
a
seducer
he
that
is
a
murderer
he
that
is
sacrilegious
and
infamous
let
him
approach
without
fear
for
with
this
water
will
i
wash
him
and
will
straightway
make
him
clean
and
though
he
should
be
guilty
of
those

sins
a
second
time
let
him
but
smite
his
breast
and
beat
his
head
and
i
will
make
him
clean
to
him
constantine
came
gladly
when
he
had
conducted
his
sons
forth
from
the
assembly
of
the
gods
but
the
avenging
deities
none
the
less
punished
both
him
and
them
for
their
impiety
and
exacted
the
penalty
for
the
shedding
of
the
blood
of
their
kindred
until
zeus
granted
them
a
respite
for
the
sake

julian
came
to
antioch
on
his
way
to
persia
in
the
autumn
of
and
stayed
there
till
march
the
city
was
rich
and
important
commercially
but
in
julian
s
eyes
her
glory
depended
on
two
things
the
famous
shrine
of
apollo
and
the
school
of
rhetoric
and
both
of
these
had
been
neglected
by
the
citizens
during
the
reign
of
constantius
a
christian
church
had
been
built
in
apollo
s
grove
in
the
suburb
of
daphne
and
libanius
antioch
s
most
distinguished
rhetorician
was
more
highly
honoured
at
nicomedia
julian
s
behaviour
at
antioch
and
his
failure
to
ingratiate
himself
with
the
citizens
illustrates
one
of
the
causes
of
the
failure
of
his
pagan
restoration
his
mistake
was
that
he
did
not
attempt
to
make
paganism
popular
whereas
christianity
had
always
been
democratic
he
is
always
reminding
the
common
people
that
the
true
knowledge
of
the
gods
is
reserved
for
philosophers
and
even
the
old
conservative
pagans
did
not
share
his
zeal
for
philosophy
antioch
moreover
was
a
frivolous
city
the
emperor
hadrian
three
centuries
earlier
had
been
much
offended
by
the
levity
of
her
citizens
and
the
homilies
of
saint
chrysostom
exhibit
the
same
picture
as
julian
s
satire
his
austere
personality
and
mode
of
life
repelled
the
syrian
populace
and
the
corrupt
officials
of
antioch
they
satirised
him
in
anapaestic
verses
and
either
stayed
away
from
the
temples
that
he
restored
or
when
they
did
attend
in
response
to
his
summons
showed
by
their
untimely
applause
of
the
emperor
that
they
had
not
come
to
worship
his
gods
julian
s
answer
was
this
satire
on
himself
which
he
addresses
directly
to
the
people
of
antioch
but
he
could
not
resist
scolding
them
and
the
satire
on
his
own
habits
is
not
consistently
maintained
after
he
had
left
the
city
the
citizens
repented
and
sent
a
deputation
to
make
their
peace
with
him
but
in
spite
of
the
intercession
of
libanius
who
had
accompanied
him
to
antioch
he
could
not
forgive
the
insults
to
himself
or
the
irreverence
that
had
been
displayed

the
poet
composed
many
delightful
songs
for
a
luxurious
life
was
allotted
to
him
by
the
fates
but
alcaeus
and
archilochus
of
paros
the
god
did
not
permit
to
devote
their
muse
to
mirth
and
pleasure
for
constrained
as
they
were
to
endure
toil
now
of
one
sort
now
of
another
they
used
their
poetry
to
relieve
their
toil
and
by
abusing
those
who
wronged
them
they
lightened
the
burdens
imposed
on
them
by
heaven
but
as
for
me
the
law
forbids
me
to
accuse
by
name
those
who
though
i
have
done
them
no
wrong
try
to
show
their
hostility
to
me
and
on
the
other
hand
the
fashion
of
education
that
now
prevails
among
the
deprives
me
of
the
use
of
the
music
that
consists
in
song
for
in
these
days
men
think
it
more
degrading
to
study
music
than
once
in
the
past
they
thought
it
to
be
rich
by
dishonest
means
nevertheless
i
will
not
on
that
account
renounce
the
aid
that
it
is
in
my
power
to
win
from
the
muses
indeed
i
have
observed
that
even
the
barbarians
across
the
rhine
sing
savage
songs
composed
in
language
not
unlike
the
croaking
of
birds
and
that
they
delight
in
such
songs
for
i
think
it
is
always
the
case
that
inferior
musicians
though
they
annoy
their
audiences
give
very
great
pleasure
to
themselves
and
with
this
in
mind
i
often
say
to
myself
like
though
my
talents
are
not
equal
to
his
i
have
as
i
persuade
myself
a
similar
independence
of
i
sing

however
the
song
that
i
now
sing
has
been
composed
in
prose
and
it
contains
much
violent
abuse
directed
not
by
zeus
against
could
it
be
since
the
law
forbids
against
the
poet
and
author
himself
for
there
is
no
law
to
prevent
one
s
writing
either
praise
or
criticism
of
oneself
now
as
for
praising
myself
though
i
should
be
very
glad
to
do
so
i
have
no
reason
for
that
but
for
criticising
myself
i
have
countless
reasons
and
first
i
will
begin
with
my
face
for
though
nature
did
not
make
this
any
too
handsome
or
or
give
it
the
bloom
of
youth
i
myself
out
of
sheer
perversity
and
have
added
to
it
this
long
beard
of
mine
to
punish
it
as
it
would
seem
for
this
very
crime
of
not
being
handsome
by
nature
for
the
same
reason
i
put
up
with
the
lice
that
scamper
about
in
it
as
though
it
were
a
thicket
for
wild
beasts
as
for
eating
greedily
or
drinking
with
my
mouth
wide
open
it
is
not
in
my
power
for
i
must
take
care
i
suppose
or
before
i
know
it
i
shall
eat
up
some
of
my
own
hairs
along
with
my
crumbs
of
bread
in
the
matter
of
being
kissed
and
kissing
i
suffer
no
inconvenience
whatever
and
yet
for
this
as
for
other
purposes
a
beard
is
evidently
troublesome
since
it
does
not
allow
one
to
press
shaven
lips
to
other
lips
more
sweetly
they
are
smooth
i
has
been
said
already
by
one
of
those
who
with
the
aid
of
pan
and
calliope
composed
poems
in
honour
of
daphnis
but
you
say
that
i
ought
to
twist
ropes
from
it
well
i
am
willing
to
provide
you
with
ropes
if
only
you
have
the
strength
to
pull
them
and
their
roughness
does
not
do
dreadful
damage
to
your
unworn
and
tender
and
let
no
one
suppose
that
i
am
offended
by
your
satire
for
i
myself
furnish
you
with
an
excuse
for
it
by
wearing
my
chin
as
goats
do
when
i
might
i
suppose
make
it
smooth
and
bare
as
handsome
youths
wear
theirs
and
all
women
who
are
endowed
by
nature
with
loveliness
but
you
since
even
in
your
old
age
you
emulate
your
own
sons
and
daughters
by
your
soft
and
delicate
way
of
living
or
perhaps
by
your
effeminate
dispositions
carefully
make
your
chins
smooth
and
your
manhood
you
barely
reveal
and
slightly
indicate
by
your
foreheads
not
by
your
jaws

but
as
though
the
mere
length
of
my
beard
were
not
enough
my
head
is
dishevelled
besides
and
i
seldom
have
my
hair
cut
or
my
nails
while
my
fingers
are
nearly
always
black
from
using
a
pen
and
if
you
would
like
to
learn
something
that
is
usually
a
secret
my
breast
is
shaggy
and
covered
with
hair
like
the
breasts
of
lions
who
among
wild
beasts
are
monarchs
like
me
and
i
have
never
in
my
life
made
it
smooth
so
and
shabby
am
i
nor
have
i
made
any
other
part
of
my
body
smooth
or
soft
if
i
had
a
wart
like
cicero
i
would
tell
you
so
but
as
it
happens
i
have
none
and
by
your
leave
i
will
tell
you
something
else
i
am
not
content
with
having
my
body
in
this
rough
condition
but
in
addition
the
mode
of
life
that
i
practise
is
very
strict
indeed
i
banish
myself
from
the
theatres
such
a
dolt
am
i
and
i
do
not
admit
the
thymele
within
my
court
except
on
the
first
day
of
the
year
because
i
am
too
stupid
to
appreciate
it
like
some
country
fellow
who
from
his
small
means
has
to
pay
a
tax
or
render
tribute
to
a
harsh
master
and
even
when
i
do
enter
the
theatre
i
look
like
a
man
who
is
expiating
a
crime
then
again
though
i
am
entitled
a
mighty
emperor
i
employ
no
one
to

all

things
are
externals
and
indeed
what
a
small
fraction
of
my
offences
against
you
have
i
described
but
to
turn
to
my
private
life
within
the
court
sleepless
nights
on
a
pallet
and
a
diet
that
is
anything
rather
than
surfeiting
make
my
temper
harsh
and
unfriendly
to
a
luxurious
city
like
yours
however
it
is
not
in
order
to
set
an
example
to
you
that
i
adopt
these
habits
but
in
my
childhood
a
strange
and
senseless
delusion
came
over
me
and
persuaded
me
to
war
against
my
belly
so
that
i
do
not
allow
it
to
fill
itself
with
a
great
quantity
of
food
thus
it
has
happened
to
me
most
rarely
of
all
men
to
vomit
my
food
and
though
i
remember
having
this
experience
once
after
i
became
caesar
it
was
by
accident
and
was
not
due
to
it
may
be
worth

tell

story

i
happened
to
be
in
winter
quarters
at
my
beloved
that
is
how
the
celts
call
the
capital
of
the
parisians
it
is
a
small
island
lying
in
the
river
a
wall
entirely
surrounds
it
and
wooden
bridges
lead
to
it
on
both
sides
the
river
seldom
rises
and
falls
but
usually
is
the
same
depth
in
the
winter
as
in
the
summer
season
and
it
provides
water
which
is
very
clear
to
the
eye
and
very
pleasant
for
one
who
wishes
to
drink
for
since
the
inhabitants
live
on
an
island
they
have
to
draw
their
water
chiefly
from
the
river
the
winter
too
is
rather
mild
there
perhaps
from
the
warmth
of
the
ocean
which
is
not
more
than
nine
hundred
stades
distant
and
it
may
be
that
a
slight
breeze
from
the
water
is
wafted
so
far
for
sea
water
seems
to
be
warmer
than
fresh
whether
from
this
or
from
some
other
cause
obscure
to
me
the
fact
is
as
i
say
that
those
who
live
in
that
place
have
a
warmer
winter
and
a
good
kind
of
vine
grows
thereabouts
and
some
persons
have
even
managed
to
make
grow
by
covering
them
in
winter
with
a
sort
of
garment
of
wheat
straw
and
with
things
of
that
sort
such
as
are
used
to
protect
trees
from
the
harm
that
is
done
them
by
the
cold
wind
as
i
was
saying
then
the
winter
was
more
severe
than
usual
and
the
river
kept
bringing
down
blocks
like
marble
you
know
i
suppose
the
white
stone
that
comes
from
phrygia
the
blocks
of
ice
were
very
like
it
of
great
size
and
drifted
down
one
after
another
in
fact
it
seemed
likely
that
they
would
make
an
unbroken
path
and
bridge
the
stream
the
winter
then
was
more
inclement
than
usual
but
the
room
where
i
slept
was
not
warmed
in
the
way
that
most
houses
are
heated
i
mean
by
furnaces
underground
and
that
too
though
it
was
conveniently
arranged
for
letting
in
heat
from
such
a
fire
but
it
so
happened
i
suppose
because
i
was
awkward
then
as
now
and
displayed
inhumanity
first
of
all
as
was
natural
towards
myself
for
i
wished
to
accustom
myself
to
bear
the
cold
air
without
needing
this
aid
and
though
the
winter
weather
prevailed
and
continually
increased
in
severity
even
so
i
did
not
allow
my
servants
to
heat
the
house
because
i
was
afraid
of
drawing
out
the
dampness
in
the
walls
but
i
ordered
them
to
carry
in
fire
that
had
burned
down
and
to
place
in
the
room
a
very
moderate
number
of
hot
coals
but
the
coals
though
there
were
not
very
many
of
them
brought
out
from
the
walls
quantities
of
steam
and
this
made
me
fall
asleep
and
since
my
head
was
filled
with
the
fumes
i
was
almost
choked
then
i
was
carried
outside
and
since
the
doctors
advised
me
to
throw
up
the
food
i
had
just
swallowed
it
was
little
enough
by
i
vomited
it
and
at
once
became
easier
so
that
i
had
a
more
comfortable
night
and
next
day
could
do
whatever
i
pleased

after
this
fashion
then
even
when
i
was
among
the
celts
like
the
tempered
man
in

i
myself
kept
heaping
troubles
on
my
own
but
whereas
the
boorish
celts
used
easily
to
put
up
with
these
ways
of
mine
they
are
naturally
resented
by
a
prosperous
and
gay
and
crowded
city
in
which
there
are
numerous
dancers
and
flute
players
and
more
mimes
than
ordinary
citizens
and
no
respect
at
all
for
those
who
govern
for
the
blush
of
modesty
befits
the
unmanly
but
manly
fellows
like
you
it
befits
to
begin
your
revels
at
dawn
to
spend
your
nights
in
pleasure
and
to
show
not
only
by
your
words
but
by
your
deeds
also
that
you
despise
the
laws
for
indeed
it
is
only
by
means
of
those
in
authority
that
the
laws
inspire
fear
in
men
so
that
he
who
insults
one
who
is
in
authority
over
and
above
this
tramples
on
the
laws
and
that
you
take
pleasure
in
this
sort
of
behaviour
you
show
clearly
on
many
occasions
but
especially
in
the
and
theatres
the
mass
of
the
people
by
their
clapping
and
shouting
while
those
in
office
show
it
by
the
fact
that
on
account
of
the
sums
they
have
spent
on
such
entertainments
they
are
more
widely
known
and
more
talked
about
by
all
men
than
solon
the
athenian
ever
was
on

of
his
interview
with

of

and
all
of
you
are
handsome

tall

are

what
then
you
answer
did
you
really
suppose
that
your
boorish
manners
and
savage
ways
and
clumsiness
would
harmonise
with
these
things
o
most
ignorant
and
most
quarrelsome
of
men
is
it
so
senseless
then
and
so
stupid
that
puny
soul
of
yours
which
men
of
poor
spirit
call
temperate
and
which
you
forsooth
think
it
your
duty
to
adorn
and
deck
out
with
temperance
you
are
wrong
for
in
the
first
place
we
do
not
know
what
temperance
is
and
we
hear
its
name
only
while
the
real
thing
we
can
not
see
but
if
it
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
you
now
practise
if
it
consists
in
knowing
that
men
must
be
enslaved
to
the
gods
and
the
laws
in
behaving
with
fairness
to
those
of
equal
rank
and
bearing
with
mildness
any
superiority
among
them
in
studying
and
taking
thought
that
the
poor
may
suffer
no
injustice
whatever
at
the
hands
of
the
rich
and
to
attain
this
in
putting
up
with
all
the
annoyances
that
you
will
naturally
often
meet
with
hatred
anger
and
abuse
and
then
in
bearing
these
also
with
firmness
and
not
resenting
them
or
giving
way
to
your
anger
but
in
training
yourself
as
far
as
possible
to
practise
temperance
and
if
again
this
also
one
defines
as
the
effect
of
temperance
that
one
abstains
from
every
pleasure
even
though
it
be
not
excessively
unbecoming
or
considered
blameworthy
when
openly
pursued
because
you
are
convinced
that
it
is
impossible
for
a
man
to
be
temperate
in
his
private
life
and
in
secret
if
in
public
and
openly
he
is
willing
to
be
licentious
and
delights
in
the
theatres
if
in
short
temperance
is
really
this
sort
of
thing
then
you
yourself
have
ruined
yourself
and
moreover
you
are
ruining
us
who
can
not
bear
in
the
first
place
even
to
hear
the
name
of
slavery
whether
it
be
slavery
to
the
gods
or
the
laws
for
sweet

all
things

what
an

of

is
yours
you
say
that
you
are
not

and
you
will
not
let
yourself
be
so
called

more
you
resent
the
idea
so
that
you
have
actually
persuaded
the
majority
of
men
who
have
long
grown
accustomed
to
it
to
get
rid
of
this
word
government
as
though
it
were
something
invidious
and
yet
you
compel
us
to
be
enslaved
to
magistrates
and
laws
but
how
much
better
it
would
be
for
you
to
accept
the
name
of
master

in
actual
fact
to
allow
us
to
be
free
you
who
are
so
very
mild
about
the
names
we
use
and
so
very
strict
about
the
things
we
do
then
again
you
harass
us
by
forcing
the
rich
to
behave
with
moderation
in
the
lawcourts
though
you
keep
the
poor
from
making
money
by
informing
and
by
ignoring
the
stage
and
mimes
and
dancers
you
have
ruined
our
city
so
that
we
get
no
good
out
of
you
except
your
harshness
and
this
we
have
had
to
put
up
with
these
seven
months
so
that
we
have
left
it
to
the
old
crones
who
grovel
among
the
tombs
to
pray
that
we
may
be
entirely
rid
of

come
i
am
ready
to
make
a
fresh
start
in
abusing
myself
you
sir
go
regularly
to
the
temples
perverse
and
wholly
worthless
as
you
are
it
is
your
doing
that
the
masses
stream
into
the
sacred
precincts
yes
and
most
of
the
magistrates
as
well
and
they
give
you
a
splendid
welcome
greeting
you
with
shouts
and
clapping
in
the
precincts
as
though
they
were
in
the
theatres
then
why
do
you
not
treat
them
kindly
and
praise
them
instead
of
that
you
try
to
be
wiser
in
such
matters
than
the
pythian
god
and
you
make
harangues
to
the
crowd
and
with
harsh
words
rebuke
those
who
shout
these
are
the
very
words
you
use
to
them
you
hardly
ever
assemble
at
the
shrines
to
do
honour
to
the
gods
but
to
do
me
honour
you
rush
here
in
crowds
and
fill
the
temples
with
much
disorder
yet
it
becomes
prudent
men
to
pray
in
orderly
fashion
and
to
ask
blessings
from
the
gods
in
silence
have
you
never
heard
homer
s
maxim

did
not
show
us
the
trojan
women
praying
to
priam
or
to
any
one
of
his
daughters
or
sons
nay
not
even
to
hector
himself
though
he
does
indeed
say
that
the
men
of
troy
were
wont
to
pray
to
hector
as
to
a
god
but
in
his
poems
he
did
not
show
us
either
women
or
men
in
the
act
of
prayer
to
him
but
he
says
that
to
athene
all
the
women
lifted
up
their
hands
with
a
loud
cry
which
was
in
itself
a
barbaric
thing
to
do
and
suitable
only
for
women
but
at
any
rate
it
displayed
no
impiety
to
the
gods
as
does
your
conduct
for
you
applaud
men
instead
of
the
gods
or
rather
instead
of
the
gods
you
flatter
me
who
am
a
mere
man

it
would
be

not
to

am

busy

my
usual
i
do
not
even
allow
myself
to
speak
out
at
random
fearlessly
and
freely
but
with
my
usual
awkwardness
i
am
laying
information
against
myself
it
is
thus
and
in
words
like
these
that
one
ought
to
address
men
who
want
to
be
free
not
only
with
respect
to
those
who
govern
them
but
to
the
gods
also
in
order
that
one
may
be
considered
towards
them
like
an
indulgent
father
even
though
one
is
by
nature
an
person
like
myself
bear
with
them
then
when
they
hate
and
abuse
you
in
secret
or
even
openly
since
you
thought
that
those
who
applauded
you
with
one
accord
in
the
temples
were
only
flattering
you
for
surely
you
did
not
suppose
that
you
would
be
in
harmony
with
the
pursuits
or
the
lives
or
the
temperaments
of
these
men
i
grant
that
but
who
will
bear
with
this
other
habit
of
yours
you
always
sleep
alone
at
night
and
there
is
no
way
of
softening
your
savage
and
uncivilised
all
avenues
are
closed
to
anything
that
might
sweeten
your
disposition
the
worst
of
all
these
evils
is
that
you
delight
in
living
that
sort
of
life
and
have
laid
pleasure
under
a
general
ban
then
can
you
feel
aggrieved
if
you
hear
yourself
spoken
of
in
such
terms
no
you
ought
to
feel
grateful
to
those
who
out
of
kindness
of
heart
admonish
you
wittily
in
anapaestic
verse
to
shave
your
cheeks
smooth
and
then
beginning
with
yourself
first
to
show
to
this
people
all
sorts
of
fine
spectacles
mimes
dancers
shameless
women
boys
who
in
their
beauty
emulate
women
and
men
who
have
not
only
their
jaws
shaved
smooth
but
their
whole
bodies
too
so
that
those
who
meet
them
may
think
them
smoother
than
women
yes
and
feasts
too
and
general
festivals
not
by
zeus
the
sacred
ones
at
which
one
is
bound
to
behave
with
sobriety
no
we
have
had
enough
of
those
like
the
oak
tree
in
the
proverb
we
are
completely
surfeited
with
them
the
emperor
sacrificed
once
in
the
temple
of
zeus
then
in
the
temple
of
fortune
he
visited
the
temple
of
demeter
three
times
in
i
have
in
fact
forgotten
how
many
times
i
entered
the
shrine
of
daphne
which
had
been
first
abandoned
owing
to
the
carelessness
of
its
guardians
and
then
destroyed
by
the
audacious
acts
of
godless
men
the
syrian
new
year
arrived
and
again
the
emperor
went
to
the
temple
of
zeus
the
friendly
one
then
came
the
general
festival
and
the
emperor
went
to
the
shrine
of
fortune
then
after
refraining
on
the
forbidden
day
again
he
goes
to
the
temple
of
zeus
the
friendly
one
and
offers
up
prayers
according
to
the
custom
of
our
ancestors
now
who
could
put
up
with
an
emperor
who
goes
to
the
temples
so
often
when
it
is
in
his
power
to
disturb
the
gods
only
once
or
twice
and
to
celebrate
the
general
festivals
which
are
for
all
the
people
in
common
those
in
which
not
only
men
whose
profession
it
is
to
have
knowledge
of
the
gods
can
take
part
but
also
the
people
who
have
crowded
into
the
city
for
pleasure
is
here
in
abundance
and
delights
whose
fruits
one
could
enjoy
continuously
for
instance
the
sight
of
men
and
pretty
boys
dancing
and
any
number
of
charming

what
has
been
the
temper
of
this
city
from
the
beginning
and
that
too
though
i
am
convinced
that
i
have
turned
over
quite
as
many
books
as
any
man
of
my
own
age
you
know
of
course
the
tale
that
is
told
about
the
king
who
gave
his
name
to
this
rather
whose
name
the
city
received
when
it
was
colonised
for
it
was
founded
by
seleucus
though
it
takes
its
name
from
the
son
of
they
say
then
that
out
of
excessive
softness
and
luxury
the
latter
was
constantly
falling
in
love
and
being
loved
and
finally
he
conceived
a
dishonourable
passion
for
his
own
and
though
he
wished
to
conceal
his
condition
he
could
not
and
little
by
little
his
body
began
to
waste
away
and
to
become
transparent
and
his
powers
to
wane
and
his
breathing
was
feebler
than
usual
but
what
could
be
the
matter
with
him
was
i
think
a
sort
of
riddle
since
his
malady
had
no
visible
cause
or
rather
it
did
not
even
appear
what
was
its
nature
though
the
youth
s
weakness
was
manifest
then
the
physician
of
samos
was
set
a
difficult
problem
namely
to
discover
what
was
the
nature
of
the
malady
now
he
suspecting
from
the
words
of
homer
what
is
the
nature
of
cares
that
devour
the
limbs
and
that
in
many
cases
it
is
not
a
bodily
weakness
but
an
infirmity
of
soul
that
causes
a
wasting
of
the
body
and
seeing
moreover
that
the
youth
was
very
susceptible
to
love
because
of
his
time
of
life
and
his
habits
he
took
the
following
way
of
tracking
down
the
disease
he
sat
near
the
youth
s
couch
and
watched
his
face
after
ordering
handsome
youths
and
women
to
walk
past
him
beginning
with
the
queen
herself
now
when
she
entered
apparently
to
see
how
he
was
the
young
man
at
once
began
to
show
the
symptoms
of
his
malady
he
breathed
like
one
who
is
being
choked
for
though
he
was
very
anxious
to
control
his
agitated
breathing
he
could
not
but
it
became
disordered
and
a
deep
blush
spread
over
his
face
the
physician
on
seeing
this
laid
his
hand
to
his
breast
and
found
that
his
heart
was
beating
terribly
fast
and
was
trying
to
burst
forth
from
his
breast
such
were
his
symptoms
while
she
was
present
but
when
she
had
gone
away
and
others
came
in
he
remained
calm
and
was
like
a
man
in
a
normal
state
of
health
then
erasistratus
saw
what
ailed
him
and
told
the
king
and
he
out
of
love
for
his
son
said
that
he
would
give
up
his
wife
to
him
now
the
youth
for
the
moment
refused
but
when
his
father
died
not
long
after
he
sought
with
the
greatest
vehemence
the
favour
which
he
had
so
honourably
refused
when
it
was
first
offered
to
him

now
since
this
was
the
conduct
of
antiochus
i
have
no
right
to
be
angry
with
his
descendants
when
they
emulate
their
founder
or
him
who
gave
his
name
to
the
city
for
just
as
in
the
case
of
plants
it
is
natural
that
their
qualities
should
be
transmitted
for
a
long
time
or
rather
that
in
general
the
succeeding
generation
should
resemble
its
ancestors
so
too
in
the
case
of
human
beings
it
is
natural
that
the
morals
of
descendants
should
resemble
those
of
their
ancestors
i
myself
for
instance
have
found
that
the
athenians
are
the
most
ambitious
for
honour
and
the
most
humane
of
all
the
greeks
and
indeed
i
have
observed
that
these
qualities
exist
in
an
admirable
degree
among
all
the
greeks
and
i
can
say
for
them
that
more
than
all
other
nations
they
love
the
gods
and
are
hospitable
to
strangers
i
mean
all
the
greeks
generally
but
among
them
the
athenians
above
all
as
i
can
bear
witness
and
if
they
still
preserve
in
their
characters
the
image
of
their
ancient
virtue
surely
it
is
natural
that
the
same
thing
should
be
true
of
the
syrians
also
and
the
arabs
and
celts
and
thracians
and
paeonians
and
those
who
dwell
between
the
thracians
and
paeonians
i
mean
the
mysians
on
the
very
banks
of
the
danube
from
whom
my
own
family
is
derived
a
stock
wholly
boorish
austere
awkward
without
charm
and
abiding
immovably
by
its
decisions
all
of
which
qualities
are
proofs
of
terrible
boorishness

but
now
i
come
to
ponder
the
matter
i
find
that
i
have
committed
yet
other
terrible
sins
for
though
i
was
coming
to
a
free
city
which
can
not
tolerate
unkempt
hair
i
entered
it
unshaven
and
with
a
long
beard
like
men
who
are
at
a
loss
for
a
barber
one
would
have
thought
it
was
some
smicrines
he
saw
or
some
thrasyleon
some
old
man
or
crazy
soldier
when
by
beautifying
myself
i
might
have
appeared
as
a
blooming
boy
and
transformed
myself
into
a
youth
if
not
in
years
at
any
rate
in
manners
and
effeminacy
of
features
you
do
not
know
you
answer
how
to
mix
with
people
and
can
not
approve
of
the
maxim
of
theognis
for
you
do
not
imitate
the
polypus
which
takes
on
the
colours
of
the
rocks
nay
rather
you
behave
to
all
men
with
the
proverbial
myconian
boorishness
and
ignorance
and
stupidity
are
you
not
aware
that
we
here
are
far
from
being
celts
or
thracians
or
illyrians
do
you
not
see
what
a
number
of
shops
there
are
in
this
city
but
you
are
hated
by
the
shopkeepers
because
you
do
not
allow
them
to
sell
provisions
to
the
common
people
and
those
who
are
visiting
the
city
at
a
price
as
high
as
they
please
the
shopkeepers
blame
the
landowners
for
the
high
prices
but
you
make
these
men
also
your
enemies
by
compelling
them
to
do
what
is
just
again
those
who
hold
office
in
the
city
are
subject
to
both
penalties
i
mean
that
just
as
before
you
came
they
obviously
used
to
enjoy
profits
from
both
sources
both
as
landowners
and
as
shopkeepers
so
naturally
they
are
now
aggrieved
on
both
accounts
since
they
have
been
robbed
of
their
profits
from
both
sources
then
the
whole
body
of
syrian
citizens
are
discontented
because
they
can
not
get
drunk
and
dance
the
cordax
you
however
think
that
you
are
feeding
them
well
enough
if
you
provide
them
with
plenty
of
corn
another
charming
thing
about
you
is
that
you
do
not
even
take
care
that
the
city
shall
have
nay
more
when
someone
complained
the
other
day
that
neither
nor
much
poultry
could
be
found
in
the
market
you
laughed
very
maliciously
and
said
that
a
city
needs
bread
wine
and
olive
oil
but
meat
only
when
it
is
growing
luxurious
for
you
said
that
even
to
speak
of
fish
and
poultry
is
the
extreme
of
luxury
and
of
profligacy
such
as
was
beyond
the
reach
of
even
the
suitors
in
ithaca
and
that
anyone
who
did
not
enjoy
eating
pork
and
mutton
would
fare
very
well
if
he
took
to
vegetables
you
must
have
thought
that
you
were
laying
down
these
rules
for
thracians
your
own
or
for
the
uncultured
people
of
gaul
much
the
worse
for
us
you
to
be
a
heart
of
maple
a
heart
of
oak
though
not
indeed
one
who
fought
at
marathon
also
but
rather
to
be
half
of
you
an
acharnian
and
altogether
an
unpleasant
person
and
an
ungracious
fellow
would
it
not
be
better
that
the
market
place
should
be
fragrant
with
myrrh
when
you
walk
there
and
that
you
should
be
followed
by
a
troop
of
handsome
boys
at
whom
the
citizens
could
stare
and
by
choruses
of
women
like
those
that
exhibit
themselves
every
day
in
our
city

no
my
temperament
does
not
allow
me
to
look
wanton
casting
my
eyes
in
all
directions
in
order
that
in
your
sight
i
may
appear
beautiful
not
indeed
in
soul
but
in
face
for
in
your
judgment
true
beauty
of
soul
consists
in
a
wanton
life
i
however
was
taught
by
my
tutor
to
look
on
the
ground
when
i
was
on
my
way
to
school
and
as
for
a
theatre
i
never
saw
one
until
i
had
more
hair
on
my
chin
than
on
my
head
and
even
at
that
age
it
was
never
on
my
own
account
and
by
my
own
wish
but
three
or
four
times
you
must
know
the
governor
who
was
my
kinsman
and
near
relative
doing
a
favour
to
patroclus
ordered
me
to
attend
it
was
while
i
was
still
a
private
individual
therefore
forgive
me
for
i
hand
over
to
you
instead
of
myself
one
whom
you
will
more
justly
detest
i
mean
that
curmudgeon
my
tutor
who
even
then
used
to
harass
me
by
teaching
me
to
walk
in
one
straight
path
and
now
he
is
responsible
for
my
quarrel
with
you
it
was
he
who
wrought
in
my
soul
and
as
it
were
carved
therein
what
i
did
not
then
desire
though
he
was
very
zealous
in
implanting
it
as
though
he
were
producing
some
charming
characteristic
and
boorishness
he
called
dignity
lack
of
taste
he
called
sobriety
and
not
yielding
to
one
s
desires
or
achieving
happiness
by
that
means
he
called
manliness
i
assure
you
by
zeus
and
the
muses
that
while
i
was
still
a
mere
boy
my
tutor
would
often
say
to
me
never
let
the
crowd
of
your
playmates
who
flock
to
the
theatres
lead
you
into
the
mistake
of
craving
for
such
spectacles
as
these
have
you
a
passion
for
horse
races
there
is
one
in
homer
very
cleverly
described
take
the
book
and
study
it
do
you
hear
them
talking
about
dancers
in
pantomime
leave
them
alone
among
the
phaeacians
the
youths
dance
in
more
manly
fashion
and
for
citharode
you
have
phemius
for
singer
demodocus
moreover
there
are
in
homer
many
plants
more
delightful
to
hear
of
than
those
that

and
now
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
also
my
tutor
s
name
and
the
nationality
of
the
man
who
used
to
say
these
things
he
was
a
barbarian
by
the
gods
and
goddesses
by
birth
he
was
a
scythian
and
he
had
the
same
name
as
the
man
who
persuaded
xerxes
to
invade
greece
moreover
he
was
a
eunuch
a
word
which
twenty
months
ago
was
constantly
heard
and
revered
though
it
is
now
applied
as
an
insult
and
a
term
of
abuse
he
had
been
brought
up
under
the
patronage
of
my
grandfather
in
order
that
he
might
instruct
my
mother
in
the
poems
of
homer
and
hesiod
and
since
she
after
giving
birth
to
me
her
first
and
only
child
died
a
few
months
later
snatched
away
while
she
was
still
a
young
girl
by
the
motherless
maiden
from
so
many
misfortunes
that
were
to
come
i
was
handed
over
to
him
after
my
seventh
year
from
that
time
he
won
me
over
to
these
views
of
his
and
led
me
to
school
by
one
straight
path
and
since
neither
he
himself
desired
to
know
any
other
nor
allowed
me
to
travel
by
any
other
path
it
is
he
who
has
caused
me
to
be
hated
by
all
of
you
however
if
you
agree
let
us
make
a
truce
with
him
you
and
i
and
make
an
end
of
our
quarrel
for
he
neither
knew
that
i
should
visit
you
nor
did
he
anticipate
that
even
supposing
i
was
likely
to
come
here
it
would
be
as
a
ruler
and
that
too
over
so
great
an
empire
as
the
gods
bestowed
on
me
though
they
did
not
do
so
believe
me
without
using
great
compulsion
both
towards
him
who
offered
and
him
who
accepted
it
for
neither
of
us
had
the
air
of
being
willing
since
he
who
offered
that
honour
or
favour
or
whatever
you
may
please
to
call
it
was
unwilling
to
bestow
it
while
he
who
received
it
was
sincere
in
steadily
refusing
it
this
matter
however
is
and
shall
be
as
the
gods
will
but
perhaps
if
my
tutor
had
foreseen
this
he
would
have
exercised
much
forethought
to
the
end
that
i
might
as
far
as
possible
seem
agreeable
in
your
eyes

what
then
you
will
ask
is
it
not
possible
even
now
for
me
to
lay
aside
my
character
and
to
repent
of
the
boorish
temper
that
was
bred
in
me
in
earlier
days
habit
as
the
saying
goes
is
second
nature
but
to
fight
with
nature
is
hard
and
to
shake
off
the
training
of
thirty
years
is
very
difficult
especially
when
it
was
carried
on
with
such
painful
effort
and
i
am
already
more
than
thirty
years
old
well
and
good
you
answer
but
what
is
the
matter
with
you
that
you
try
to
hear
and
decide
cases
about
contracts
for
surely
your
tutor
did
not
teach
you
this
also
since
he
did
not
even
know
whether
you
would
yes
it
was
that
terrible
old
man
who
convinced
me
that
i
ought
to
do
so
and
you
also
do
well
to
help
me
to
abuse
him
since
he
is
of
all
men
most
responsible
for
my
way
of
life
though
he
too
you
must
know
had
in
his
turn
been
misled
by
others
theirs
are
names
that
you
have
often
met
when
they
are
ridiculed
in
mean
plato
and
socrates
aristotle
and
theophrastus
this
old
man
in
his
folly
was
first
convinced
by
them
and
then
he
got
hold
of
me
since
i
was
young
and
loved
literature
and
convinced
me
that
if
i
would
emulate
those
famous
men
in
all
things
i
should
become
better
not
perhaps
than
other
it
was
not
with
them
that
i
had
to
certainly
better
than
my
former
self
accordingly
since
i
had
no
choice
in
the
matter
i
obeyed
him
and
now
i
am
no
longer
able
to
change
my
character
though
indeed
i
often
wish
i
could
and
i
blame
myself
for
not
granting
to
all
men
impunity
for
all
but
then
the
words
of
the
athenian
stranger
in
plato
occur
to
my
mind
though
he
who
does
no
wrong
himself
is
worthy
of
honour
he
who
does
not
allow
the
wicked
to
do
wrong
is
worthy
of
more
than
twice
as
much
honour
for
whereas
the
former
is
responsible
for
one
man
only
the
latter
is
responsible
for
many
others
besides
himself
when
he
reports
to
the
magistrates
the
of
the
rest
and
he
who
as
far
as
he
can
helps
the
magistrates
to
punish
doers
himself
being
the
great
and
powerful
man
in
the
city
let
him
i
say
be
proclaimed
as
winner
of
the
prize
for
virtue
and
we
ought
to
utter
the
same
eulogy
with
regard
to
temperance
also
and
wisdom
and
all
the
other
good
qualities
that
such
a
man
possesses
and
which
are
such
that
he
is
able
not
only
to
have
them
himself
but
also
to
impart
them
to
other

these
things
he
taught
me
when
he
thought
that
i
should
be
a
private
citizen
for
he
certainly
did
not
foresee
that
there
would
be
assigned
to
me
by
zeus
this
lot
in
life
to
which
the
god
has
now
brought
me
and
has
set
me
therein
but
i
because
i
was
ashamed
to
be
less
virtuous
as
a
ruler
than
i
had
been
as
a
private
citizen
have
unconsciously
given
you
the
benefit
of
my
own
boorishness
though
there
was
no
necessity
and
another
of
plato
s
laws
has
made
me
take
thought
for
myself
and
so
become
hateful
in
your
eyes
i
mean
the
law
which
says
that
those
who
govern
and
also
the
older
men
ought
to
train
themselves
in
respect
for
others
and
in
in
order
that
the
masses
may
look
to
them
and
so
order
their
own
lives
aright
now
since
i
alone
or
rather
in
company
with
a
few
others
am
now
pursuing
this
course
it
has
had
a
very
different
result
and
has
naturally
become
a
reproach
against
me
for
we
here
are
only
seven
persons
strangers
and
newcomers
in
your
city
indeed
one
of
our
number
is
a
of
yours
a
man
dear
to
hermes
and
to
me
an
excellent
craftsman
of
discourses
and
we
have
business
dealings
with
no
man
nor
do
we
go
by
any
road
that
does
not
lead
to
the
temples
of
the
gods
and
seldom
and
then
not
all
of
us
do
we
go
to
the
theatres
since
we
have
adopted
the
most
inglorious
line
of
conduct
and
the
most
unpopular
aim
and
end
of
life
the
wise
men
of
greece
will
surely
allow
me
to
repeat
some
of
the
sayings
current
among
you
for
i
have
no
better
way
of
illustrating
what
i
mean
we
have
stationed
ourselves
in
the
middle
of
the
road
so
highly
do
we
prize
the
opportunity
to
collide
with
you
and
to
be
disliked
when
we
ought
rather
to
try
to
please
and
flatter
you
so
has
oppressed
fool
what
business
is
it
of
yours
when
it
was
in
your
power
to
win
his
by
becoming
the
partner
in
his
you
first
let
the
profit
go
and
incur
hatred
besides
and
when
you
do
this
you
think
that
you
are
doing
right
and
are
wise
about
your
own
affairs
you
ought
to
have
taken
into
account
that
when
men
are
wronged
not
one
of
them
ever
blames
the
magistrates
but
only
the
man
who
has
wronged
him
but
the
man
who
seeks
to
do
wrong
and
is
prevented
from
it
far
from
blaming
his
proposed
victim
turns
his
grievance
against
the
magistrates

then
when
it
was
in
your
power
by
the
aid
of
this
careful
reasoning
to
refrain
from
compelling
us
to
do

that
excessively
you
then
i

fail
to

this
and
assert
that
the
citizens
ought

be
wisely
governed
have
you
not
even
observed
what
great
independence
exists
among
the
citizens
even
down
to
the
very
asses
and
camels
the
men
who
hire
them
out
lead
even
these
animals
through
the
porticoes
as
though
they
were
brides
for
the
unroofed
alleys
and
the
broad
highways
were
certainly
not
made
for
the
use
of
but
they
are
provided
merely
for
show
and
as
an
extravagance
but
in
their
independence
the
asses
prefer
to
use
the
porticoes
and
no
one
keeps
them
out
of
any
one
of
these
for
fear
he
should
be
robbing
them
of
their
independence
so
independent
is
our
city
and
yet
you
think
that
even
the
charming
youths
in
the
city
ought
to
keep
quiet
and
if
possible
think
whatever
you
like
but
at
any
rate
utter
only
what
is
agreeable
for
you
to
hear
but
it
is
their
independence
that
makes
them
hold
revels
and
this
they
always
do
handsomely
but
during
the
festivals
they

once
upon
a
time
the
citizens
of
tarentum
paid
to
the
romans
the
penalty
for
this
sort
of
jesting
seeing
that
when
drunk
at
the
festival
of
dionysus
they
insulted
the
roman
ambassadors
but
you
are
in
all
respects
more
fortunate
than
the
citizens
of
tarentum
for
you
give
yourselves
up
to
pleasure
throughout
the
whole
year
instead
of
for
a
few
days
and
instead
of
foreign
ambassadors
you
insult
your
own
sovereign
yes
even
the
very
hairs
on
his
chin
and
the
devices
engraved
on
his
coins
well
done
o
wise
citizens
both
ye
who
make
such
jests
and
ye
who
welcome
and
find
profit
in
the
jesters
for
it
is
evident
that
uttering
them
gives
pleasure
to
the
former
while
the
latter
rejoice
to
hear
jests
of
this
sort
i
share
your
pleasure
in
this
unanimity
and
you
do
well
to
be
a
city
of
one
mind
in
such
matters
since
it
is
not
at
all
dignified
or
an
enviable
task
to
restrain
and
chastise
the
licentiousness
of
the
young
for
if
one
were
to
rob
human
beings
of
the
power
to
do
and
say
what
they
please
that
would
be
to
take
away
and
curtail
the
first
principle
of
independence
therefore
since
you
knew
that
men
ought
to
be
independent
in
all
respects
you
acted
quite
rightly
in
the
first
place
when
you
permitted
the
women
to
govern
themselves
so
that
you
might
profit
by
their
being
independent
and
licentious
to
excess
secondly
when
you
entrusted
to
them
the
bringing
up
of
the
children
for
fear
that
if
they
had
to
experience
any
harsher
authority
they
might
later
turn
out
to
be
slaves
and
as
they
grew
up
to
be
boys
might
be
taught
first
of
all
to
respect
their
elders
and
then
under
the
influence
of
this
bad
habit
might
show
too
much
reverence
for
the
magistrates
and
finally
might
have
to
be
classed
not
as
men
but
as
slaves
and
becoming
temperate
and
and
orderly
might
be
before
they
knew
it
altogether
corrupted
then
what
effect
have
the
women
on
the
children
they
induce
them
to
reverence
the
same
things
as
they
do
by
means
of
pleasure
which
is
it
seems
the
most
blessed
thing
and
the
most
highly
honoured
not
only
by
men
but
by
beasts
also
it
is
for
this
reason
i
think
that
you
are
so
very
happy
because
you
refuse
every
form
of
slavery
first
you
begin
by
refusing
slavery
to
the
gods
secondly
to
the
laws
and
thirdly
to
me
who
am
the
guardian
of
the
laws
and
i
should
indeed
be
eccentric
if
when
the
gods
suffer
the
city
to
be
so
independent
and
do
not
chastise
her
i
should
be
resentful
and
angry
for
be
assured
that
the
gods
have
shared
with
me
in
the
disrespect
that
has
been
shown
to
me
in
your
city

say
the

never

in
any
way
nor
did
the
now
the
meaning
of
this
riddle
which
your
wisdom
has
invented
is
hard
to
understand
but
i
obtained
interpreters
from
your
city
and
i
was
informed
that
these
are
the
first
letters
of
names
and
that
the
former
is
intended
to
represent
christ
the
latter
constantius
bear
with
me
then
if
i
speak
frankly
in
one
thing
constantius
did
harm
you
in
that
when
he
had
appointed
me
as
caesar
he
did
not
put
me
to
death
now
for
the
rest
may
the
gods
grant
to
you
alone
out
of
all
the
many
citizens
of
rome
to
have
experience
of
the
avarice
of
many
a
constantius
or
i
should
say
rather
of
the
avarice
of
his
friends
for
the
man
was
my
cousin
and
dear
to
me
but
after
he
had
chosen
enmity
with
me
instead
of
friendship
and
then
the
gods
with
the
utmost
benevolence
arbitrated
our
contention
with
one
another
i
proved
myself
a
more
loyal
friend
to
him
than
he
had
expected
to
find
me
before
i
became
his
enemy
then
why
do
you
think
that
you
are
annoying
me
by
your
praises
of
him
when
i
am
really
angry
with
those
who
slander
him
but
as
for
christ
you
love
him
you
say
and
adopt
him
as
the
guardian
of
your
city
instead
of
zeus
and
the
god
of
daphne
and
calliope
who
revealed
your
clever
invention
did
those
citizens
of
emesa
long
for
christ
who
set
fire
to
the
tombs
of
the
galilaeans
but
what
citizens
of
emesa
have
i
ever
annoyed
i
have
however
annoyed
many
of
you
i
may
almost
say
all
the
senate
the
wealthy
citizens
the
common
people
the
latter
indeed
since
they
have
chosen
atheism
hate
me
for
the
most
part
or
rather
all
of
them
hate
me
because
they
see
that
i
adhere
to
the
ordinances
of
the
sacred
rites
which
our
forefathers
observed
the
powerful
citizens
hate
me
because
they
are
prevented
from
selling
everything
at
a
high
price
but
all
of
you
hate
me
on
account
of
the
dancers
and
the
theatres
not
because
i
deprive
others
of
these
pleasures
but
because
i
care
less
for
things
of
that
sort
than
for
frogs
croaking
in
a
pond
then
is
it
not
natural
for
me
to
accuse
myself
when
i
have
furnished
so
many
handles
for
your
hatred

ᾤχετο
cato
the
roman
however
he
wore
his
beard
i
do
not
know
but
he
deserves
to
be
praised
in
comparison
with
anyone
of
those
who
pride
themselves
on
their
temperance
and
nobility
of
soul
and
on
their
courage
above
all
i
say
once
visited
this
populous
and
luxurious
and
wealthy
city
and
when
he
saw
the
youths
in
the
suburb
drawn
up
in
full
array
and
with
them
the
magistrates
as
though
for
some
military
display
he
thought
your
ancestors
had
made
all
those
preparations
in
his
honour
so
he
quickly
dismounted
from
his
horse
and
came
forward
though
at
the
same
time
he
was
vexed
with
those
of
his
friends
who
had
preceded
him
for
having
informed
the
citizens
that
cato
was
approaching
and
so
induced
them
to
hasten
forth
and
while
he
was
in
this
position
and
was
slightly
embarrassed
and
blushing
the
master
of
the
gymnasium
ran
to
meet
him
and
called
out
stranger
where
is
demetrius
now
this
demetrius
was
a
freedman
of
pompey
who
had
acquired
a
very
large
fortune
and
if
you
want
to
know
the
amount
of
it
i
suppose
that
in
all
that
i
am
now
telling
you
are
most
anxious
to
hear
this
will
tell
you
who
has
related
the
story
damophilus
of
bithynia
has
written
compositions
of
this
sort
and
in
them
by
culling
ancedotes
from
many
books
he
has
produced
tales
that
give
the
greatest
delight
to
anyone
who
loves
to
listen
to
gossip
whether
he
be
young
or
old
for
old
age
usually
revives
in
the
elderly
that
love
of
gossip
which
is
natural
to
the
young
and
this
is
i
think
the
reason
why
both
the
old
and
the
young
are
equally
fond
of
stories
well
then
to
return
to
cato
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
how
he
greeted
the
master
of
the
gymnasium
do
not
imagine
that
i
am
slandering
your
city
for
the
story
is
not
my
own
if
any
rumour
has
come
round
even
to
your
ears
of
the
man
of
chaeronea
who
belongs
to
that
worthless
class
of
men
who
are
called
by
impostors
philosophers
myself
never
attained
to
that
class
though
in
my
ignorance
i
claimed
to
be
a
member
of
it
and
to
have
part
in
it
he
as
i
was
saying
related
that
cato
answered
not
a
word
but
only
cried
aloud
like
a
man
stricken
with
madness
and
out
of
his
senses
alas
for
this
city
and
took
himself
off

therefore
do
not
be
surprised
if
i
now
feel
towards
you
as
i
do
for
i
am
more
uncivilised
than
he
and
more
fierce
and
headstrong
in
proportion
as
the
celts
are
more
so
than
the
romans
he
was
born
in
rome
and
was
nurtured
among
roman
citizens
till
he
was
on
the
threshold
of
old
age
but
as
for
me
i
had
to
do
with
celts
and
germans
and
the
hercynian
forest
from
the
moment
that
i
was
reckoned
a
grown
man
and
i
have
by
now
spent
a
long
time
there
like
some
huntsman
who
associates
with
and
is
entangled
among
wild
beasts
there
i
met
with
temperaments
that
know
not
how
to
pay
court
or
flatter
but
only
how
to
behave
simply
and
frankly
to
all
men
alike
then
after
my
nurture
in
childhood
my
path
as
a
boy
took
me
through
the
discourses
of
plato
and
aristotle
which
are
not
at
all
suited
for
the
reading
of
communities
who
think
that
on
account
of
their
luxury
they
are
the
happiest
of
men
then
i
had
to
work
hard
myself
among
the
most
warlike
and
of
all
nations
where
men
have
knowledge
of
aphrodite
goddess
of
wedlock
only
for
the
purpose
of
marrying
and
having
children
and
know
dionysus
the
only
for
the
sake
of
just
so
much
wine
as
each
can
drink
at
a
draught
and
in
their
theatres
no
licentiousness
or
insolence
exists
nor
does
any
man
dance

cordax

a
story
is
told
of
them
that
not
long
ago
a
certain
cappadocian
was
exiled
from
here
to
that
place
a
man
who
had
been
brought
up
in
your
city
in
the
house
of
the
know
of
course
whom
i
mean
had
learned
as
he
naturally
did
learn
there
that
one
ought
not
to
have
intercourse
with
women
but
to
pay
attentions
to
youths
and
when
after
doing
and
suffering
here
i
know
not
what
he
went
to
the
court
of
the
king
in
that
country
he
took
with
him
to
remind
him
of
your
habits
here
a
number
of
dancers
and
other
such
delights
from
this
city
and
then
finally
since
he
still
needed
a
cotylist
know
the
word
and
the
thing
invited
him
also
from
here
because
of
his
longing
and
love
for
the
austere
mode
of
life
that
prevails
with
you
now
the
celts
never
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
cotylist
since
he
was
at
once
admitted
into
the
palace
but
when
the
dancers
began
to
display
their
art
in
the
theatre
the
celts
left
them
alone
because
they
thought
that
they
were
like
men
stricken
with
nympholepsy
and
the
theatre
seemed
to
the
men
in
that
country
highly
ridiculous
just
as
it
does
to
me
but
whereas
the
celts
were
a
few
ridiculing
many
i
here
along
with
a
few
others
seem
absurd
in
every
way
to
all
of
you

this
is
a
fact
which
i
do
not
resent
and
indeed
it
would
be
unjust
of
me
not
to
make
the
best
of
the
present
state
of
things
after
having
so
greatly
enjoyed
the
life
among
the
celts
for
they
loved
me
so
much
on
account
of
the
similarity
of
our
dispositions
that
not
only
did
they
venture
to
take
up
arms
on
my
behalf
but
they
gave
me
large
sums
of
money
besides
and
when
i
would
have
declined
it
they
almost
forced
me
to
take
it
and
in
all
things
readily
obeyed
me
and
what
was
most
wonderful
of
all
a
great
report
of
me
travelled
thence
to
your
city
and
all
men
proclaimed
loudly
that
i
was
brave
wise
and
just
not
only
terrible
to
encounter
in
war
but
also
skilful
in
turning
peace
to
account
easy
of
access
and
but
now
you
have
sent
them
tidings
from
here
in
return
that
in
the
first
place
the
affairs
of
the
whole
world
have
been
turned
upside
down
by
indeed
i
am
not
conscious
of
turning
anything
upside
down
either
voluntarily
or
involuntarily
secondly
that
i
ought
to
twist
ropes
from
my
beard
and
that
i
war
against
the
and
that
you
begin
to
regret
the
now
may
the
guardian
gods
of
this
city
grant
you
a
double
allowance
of
the
for
besides
this
you
falsely
accused
the
neighbouring
cities
which
are
holy
and
the
slaves
of
the
gods
like
myself
of
having
produced
the
satires
which
were
composed
against
me
though
i
know
well
that
those
cities
love
me
more
than
their
own
sons
for
they
at
once
restored
the
shrines
of
the
gods
and
overturned
all
the
tombs
of
the
godless
on
the
signal
that
was
given
by
me
the
other
day
and
so
excited
were
they
in
mind
and
so
exalted
in
spirit

but
now
consider
your
own
behaviour
many
of
you
overturned
the
altars
of
the
gods
which
had
only
just
been
erected
and
with
difficulty
did
my
indulgent
treatment
teach
you
to
keep
quiet
and
when
i
sent
away
the
body
from
daphne
some
of
you
in
expiation
of
your
conduct
towards
the
gods
handed
over
the
shrine
of
the
god
of
daphne
to
those
who
were
aggrieved
about
the
relics
of
the
body
and
the
rest
of
you
whether
by
accident
or
on
purpose
hurled
against
the
shrine
that
fire
which
made
the
strangers
who
were
visiting
your
city
shudder
but
gave
pleasure
to
the
mass
of
your
citizens
and
was
ignored
and
is
still
ignored
by
your
senate
now
in
my
opinion
even
before
that
fire
the
god
had
forsaken
the
temple
for
when
i
first
entered
it
his
holy
image
gave
me
a
sign
thereof
i
call
mighty
helios

bear
me
witness
of
this
before
all
unbelievers
and
now
i
wish
to
remind
you
of
yet
another
reason
for
your
hatred
of
me
and
then
to
abuse
thing
which
i
usually
do
fairly
both
to
accuse
and
blame
myself
with
regard
to
that
hatred

in
the
tenth
month
according
to
your
reckoning
i
think
you
call
is
a
festival
founded
by
your
forefathers
in
honour
of
this
god
and
it
was
your
duty
to
be
zealous
in
visiting
daphne
accordingly
i
hastened
thither
from
the
temple
of
zeus
kasios
thinking
that
at
daphne
if
anywhere
i
should
enjoy
the
sight
of
your
wealth
and
public
spirit
and
i
imagined
in
my
own
mind
the
sort
of
procession
it
would
be
like
a
man
seeing
visions
in
a
dream
beasts
for
sacrifice
libations
choruses
in
honour
of
the
god
incense
and
the
youths
of
your
city
there
surrounding
the
shrine
their
souls
adorned
with
all
holiness
and
themselves
attired
in
white
and
splendid
raiment
but
when
i
entered
the
shrine
i
found
there
no
incense
not
so
much
as
a
cake
not
a
single
beast
for
sacrifice
for
the
moment
i
was
amazed
and
thought
that
i
was
still
outside
the
shrine
and
that
you
were
waiting
the
signal
from
me
doing
me
that
honour
because
i
am
supreme
pontiff
but
when
i
began
to
inquire
what
sacrifice
the
city
intended
to
offer
to
celebrate
the
annual
festival
in
honour
of
the
god
the
priest
answered
i
have
brought
with
me
from
my
own
house
a
goose
as
an
offering
to
the
god

thereupon
being
fond
of
making
enemies
i
made
in
the
senate
a
very
unseemly
speech
which
perhaps
it
may
now
be
pertinent
to
quote
to
you
it
is
a
terrible
thing
i
said
that
so
important
a
city
should
be
more
neglectful
of
the
gods
than
any
village
on
the
borders
of
the
pontus
your
city
possesses
ten
thousand
lots
of
land
privately
owned
and
yet
when
the
annual
festival
in
honour
of
the
god
of
her
forefathers
is
to
be
celebrated
for
the
first
time
since
the
gods
dispelled
the
cloud
of
atheism
she
does
not
produce
on
her
own
behalf
a
single
bird
though
she
ought
if
possible
to
have
sacrificed
an
ox
for
every
tribe
or
if
that
were
too
difficult
the
whole
city
in
common
ought
at
any
rate
to
have
offered
to
the
god
one
bull
on
her
own
behalf
yet
every
one
of
you
delights
to
spend
money
privately
on
dinners
and
feasts
and
i
know
very
well
that
many
of
you
squandered
very
large
sums
of
money
on
dinners
during
the
may
festival
nevertheless
on
your
own
behalf
and
on
behalf
of
the
city
s
welfare
not
one
of
the
citizens
offers
a
private
sacrifice
nor
does
the
city
offer
a
public
sacrifice
but
only
this
priest
yet
i
think
that
it
would
have
been
more
just
for
him
to
go
home
carrying
portions
from
the
multitude
of
beasts
offered
by
you
to
the
god
for
the
duty
assigned
by
the
gods
to
priests
is
to
do
them
honour
by
their
nobility
of
character
and
by
the
practice
of
virtue
and
also
to
perform
to
them
the
service
that
is
due
but
it
befits
the
city
i
think
to
offer
both
private
and
public
sacrifice
but
as
it
is
every
one
of
you
allows
his
wife
to
carry
everything
out
of
his
house
to
the
galilaeans
and
when
your
wives
feed
the
poor
at
your
expense
they
inspire
a
great
admiration
for
godlessness
in
those
who
are
in
need
of
such
of
such
sort
are
i
think
the
great
majority
of
mankind
as
for
yourselves
you
think
that
you
are
doing
nothing
out
of
the
way
when
in
the
first
place
you
are
careless
of
the
honours
due
to
the
gods
and
not
one
of
those
in
need
goes
near
the
there
is
nothing
there
i
think
to
feed
them
yet
when
any
one
of
you
gives
a
birthday
feast
he
provides
a
dinner
and
a
breakfast
without
stint
and
welcomes
his
friends
to
a
costly
table
when
however
the
annual
festival
arrived
no
one
furnished
olive
oil
for
a
lamp
for
the
god
or
a
libation
or
a
beast
for
sacrifice
or
incense
now
i
do
not
know
how
any
good
man
could
endure
to
see
such
things
in
your
city
and
for
my
part
i
am
sure
that
it
is
displeasing
to
the
gods

this
is
what
i
remember
to
have
said
at
the
time
and
the
god
bore
witness
to
the
truth
of
my
that
he
had
not
he
forsook
your
suburb
which
for
so
long
he
had
protected
and
again
during
that
time
of
storm
and
stress
when
he
turned
in
the
wrong
direction
the
minds
of
those
who
were
then
in
power
and
forced
their
hands
but
i
acted
foolishly
in
making
myself
odious
to
you
for
i
ought
to
have
remained
silent
as
i
think
did
many
of
those
who
came
here
with
me
and
i
ought
not
to
have
been
meddlesome
or
found
fault
but
i
poured
down
all
these
reproaches
on
your
heads
to
no
purpose
owing
to
my
headlong
temper
and
a
ridiculous
desire
to
flatter
it
is
surely
not
to
be
believed
that
out
of
goodwill
towards
you
i
spoke
those
words
to
you
then
but
i
was
i
think
hunting
after
a
reputation
for
piety
towards
the
gods
and
for
sincere
towards
you
which
is
i
think
the
most
absurd
form
of
flattery
therefore
you
treat
me
justly
when
you
defend
yourselves
against
those
criticisms
of
mine
and
choose
a
different
place
for
making
your
defence
for
i
abused
you
under
the
god
s
statue
near
his
altar
and
the
footprints
of
the
holy
image
in
the
presence
of
few
witnesses
but
you
abused
me
in
the
in
the
presence
of
the
whole
populace
and
with
the
help
of
citizens
who
were
capable
of
composing
such
pleasant
witticisms
as
yours
for
you
must
be
well
aware
that
all
of
you
those
who
uttered
the
sayings
about
me
and
those
who
listened
to
them
are
equally
responsible
and
he
who
listened
with
pleasure
to
those
slanders
since
he
had
an
equal
share
of
the
pleasure
though
he
took
less
trouble
than
the
speaker
must
share
the
blame

then
you
both
uttered
and
listened
to
all
the
jests
that
were
made
about
this
miserable
beard
of
mine
and
about
one
who
has
never
displayed
to

display

he
will
never

live

to
the
slanders
which
both
in
private
and
publicly
you
have
poured
down
on
my

when
you
ridiculed
me
in

since
i
too
have
accused
myself
i
permit
you
to
employ
that
method
with
even
greater

i

never
on

do
you
any

convinced

be

pleasing

those
to

i

because
i
judge
it
more
desirable
in

i
should
fail
at

to
seem
to
them
an
honourable
and
good
man
to
give
all
men
in

a
share
of
my
unpleasantness
and
not
to
annoy
this
happy

with
the
evil
odour

it
were
of

sobriety
of

and
as
for
my
uncle
and
namesake
did
he
not
govern
you
most
justly
so
long
as
the
gods
allowed
him
to
remain
with
me
and
to
assist
me
in
my
work
did
he
not
with
the
utmost
foresight
administer
all
the
business
of
the
city
for
my
part
i
thought
these
were
admirable
things
i
mean
mildness
and
moderation
in
those
who
govern
and
i
supposed
that
by
practising
these
i
should
appear
admirable
in
your
eyes
but
since
the
length
of
my
beard
is
displeasing
to
you
and
my
unkempt
locks
and
the
fact
that
i
do
not
put
in
an
appearance
at
the
theatres
and
that
i
require
men
to
be
reverent
in
the
temples
and
since
more
than
all
these
things
my
constant
attendance
at
trials
displeases
you
and
the
fact
that
i
try
to
banish
greed
of
gain
from
the
i
willingly
go
away
and
leave
your
city
to
you
for
when
a
man
changes
his
habits
in
his
old
age
it
is
not
easy
i
think
for
him
to
escape
the
fate
that
is
described
in
the
legend
about
the
kite
the
story
goes
that
the
kite
once
had
a
note
like
that
of
other
birds
but
it
aimed
at
neighing
like
a
horse
then
since
it
forgot
its
former
note
and
could
not
quite
attain
to
the
other
sound
it
was
deprived
of
both
and
hence
the
note
it
now
utters
is
less
musical
than
that
of
any
other
bird
this
then
is
the
fate
that
i
am
trying
to
avoid
i
mean
failing
to
be
either
really
boorish
or
really
accomplished
for
already
as
you
can
see
for
yourselves

enough
of
that
but
now
in
the
name
of
zeus
god
of
the
and
guardian
of
the
city
render
me
account
of
your
ingratitude
were
you
ever
wronged
by
me
in
any
way
either
all
in
common
or
as
individuals
and
is
it
because
you
were
unable
to
avenge
yourselves
openly
that
you
now
assail
me
with
abuse
in
your
in
anapaestic
verse
just
as
comedians
drag
heracles
and
dionysus
on
the
stage
and
make
a
public
show
of
them
or
can
you
say
that
though
i
refrained
from
any
harsh
conduct
towards
you
i
did
not
refrain
from
speaking
ill
of
you
so
that
you
in
your
turn
are
defending
yourselves
by
the
same
methods
what
i
ask
is
the
reason
of
your
antagonism
and
your
hatred
of
me
for
i
am
very
sure
that
i
had
done
no
terrible
or
incurable
injury
to
any
one
of
you
either
separately
as
individuals
or
to
your
city
as
a
whole
nor
had
i
uttered
any
disparaging
word
but
i
had
even
praised
you
as
i
thought
i
was
bound
to
do
and
had
bestowed
on
you
certain
advantages
as
was
natural
for
one
who
desires
as
far
as
he
can
to
benefit
many
men
but
it
is
impossible
as
you
know
well
both
to
remit
all
their
taxes
to
the
taxpayers
and
to
give
everything
to
those
who
are
accustomed
to
receive
gifts
therefore
when
it
is
seen
that
i
have
diminished
none
of
the
public
subscriptions
which
the
imperial
purse
is
accustomed
to
contribute
but
have
remitted
not
a
few
of
your
taxes
does
not
this
business
seem
like
a

however
it
becomes
me
to
be
silent
about
all
that
i
have
done
for
all
my
subjects
in
common
lest
it
should
seem
that
i
am
purposely
as
it
were
singing
my
praises
with
my
own
lips
and
that
too
after
announcing
that
i
should
pour
down
on
my
own
head
many
most
opprobrious
insults
but
as
for
my
actions
with
respect
to
you
as
individuals
which
though
the
manner
of
them
was
rash
and
foolish
nevertheless
did
not
by
any
means
deserve
to
be
repaid
by
you
with
ingratitude
it
would
i
think
be
becoming
for
me
to
bring
them
forward
as
reproaches
against
myself
and
these
reproaches
ought
to
be
more
severe
than
those
i
uttered
before
i
mean
those
that
related
to
my
unkempt
appearance
and
my
lack
of
charm
inasmuch
as
they
are
more
genuine
since
they
have
especial
reference
to
the
soul
i
mean
that
before
i
came
here
i
used
to
praise
you
in
the
strongest
possible
terms
without
waiting
to
have
actual
experience
of
you
nor
did
i
consider
how
we
should
feel
towards
one
another
nay
since
i
thought
that
you
were
sons
of
greeks
and
i
myself
though
my
family
is
thracian
am
a
greek
in
my
habits
i
supposed
that
we
should
regard
one
another
with
the
greatest
possible
affection
this
example
of
my
rashness
must
therefore
be
counted
as
one
reproach
against
me
next
after
you
had
sent
an
embassy
to
it
arrived
not
only
later
than
all
the
other
embassies
but
even
later
than
that
of
the
alexandrians
who
dwell
in
egypt
remitted
large
sums
of
gold
and
of
silver
also
and
all
the
tribute
money
for
you
separately
apart
from
the
other
cities
and
moreover
i
increased
the
register
of
your
senate
by
two
hundred
members
and
spared
no
man
for

planning
to
make
your
city

therefore
gave
you
the
opportunity
to
elect
and
to
have
in
your
senate
the
richest
men
among
those
who
administer
my
own
revenues
and
have
charge
of
coining
the
currency
you
however
did
not
elect
the
capable
men
among
these
but
you
seized
the
opportunity
to
act
like
a
city
by
no
means
ordered
though
quite
in
keeping
with
your
character
would
you
like
me
to
remind
you
of
a
single
instance
you
nominated
a
senator
and
then
before
his
name
had
been
placed
on
the
register
and
the
scrutiny
of
his
character
was
still
pending
you
thrust
this
person
into
the
public
service
then
you
dragged
in
another
from
the
a
man
who
was
poor
and
who
belonged
to
a
class
which
in
every
other
city
is
counted
as
the
very
dregs
but
who
among
you
since
of
your
excessive
wisdom
you
exchange
rubbish
for
gold
enjoys
a
moderate
fortune
and
this
man
you
elected
as
your
colleague
many
such
offences
did
you
commit
with
regard
to
the
nominations
and
then
when
i
did
not
consent
to
everything
not
only
was
i
deprived
of
the
thanks
due
for
all
the
good
i
had
done
but
also
i
have
incurred
your
dislike
on
account
of
all
that
i
in
justice
refrained

now
these
were
very
trivial
matters
and
could
not
so
far
make
the
city
hostile
to
me
but
my
greatest
offence
of
all
and
what
aroused
that
violent
hatred
of
yours
was
the
following
when
i
arrived
among
you
the
populace
in
the
theatre
who
were
being
oppressed
by
the
rich
first
of
all
cried
aloud
everything
plentiful
everything
dear
on
the
following
day
i
had
an
interview
with
your
powerful
citizens
and
tried
to
persuade
them
that
it
is
better
to
despise
unjust
profits
and
to
benefit
the
citizens
and
the
strangers
in
your
city
and
they
promised
to
take
charge
of
the
matter
but
though
for
three
successive
months
i
took
no
notice
and
waited
they
neglected
the
matter
in
a
way
that
no
one
would
have
thought
possible
and
when
i
saw
that
there
was
truth
in
the
outcry
of
the
populace
and
that
the
pressure
in
the
market
was
due
not
to
any
scarcity
but
to
the
insatiate
greed
of
the
rich
i
appointed
a
fair
price
for
everything
and
made
it
known
to
all
men
and
since
the
citizens
had
everything
else
in
great
abundance
wine
for
instance
and
olive
oil
and
all
the
rest
but
were
short
of
corn
because
there
had
been
a
terrible
failure
of
the
crops
owing
to
the
previous
droughts
i
decided
to
send
to
chalcis
and
hierapolis
and
the
cities
round
about
and
from
them
i
imported
for
you
four
hundred
thousand
measures
of
corn
and
when
this
too
had
been
used
i
first
expended
five
thousand
then
later
seven
thousand
and
now
again
ten
thousand
modii
as
they
are
called
in
my
of
which
was
my
very
own
property
moreover
i
gave
to
the
city
corn
which
had
been
brought
for
me
from
egypt
and
the
price
which
i
set
on
it
was
a
silver
piece
not
for
ten
measures
but
for
fifteen
that
is
to
say
the
same
amount
that
had
formerly
been
paid
for
ten
measures
and
if
in
summer
in
your
city
that
same
number
of
measures
is
sold
for
that
sum
what
could
you
reasonably
have
expected
at
the
season
when
as
the
boeotian
poet
says
it
is
a
cruel
thing
for
famine
to
be
in
the
would
you
not
have
been
thankful
to
get
five
measures
for
that
sum
especially
when
the
winter
had
set
in
so
severe

but
what
did
your
rich
men
do
they
secretly
sold
the
corn
in
the
country
for
an
exaggerated
price
and
they
oppressed
the
community
by
the
expenses
that
private
persons
had
to
incur
and
the
result
is
that
not
only
the
city
but
most
of
the
country
people
too
are
flocking
in
to
buy
bread
which
is
the
only
thing
to
be
found
in
abundance
and
cheap
and
indeed
who
remembers
fifteen
measures
of
corn
to
have
been
sold
among
you
for
a
gold
piece
even
when
the
city
was
in
a
prosperous
condition
it
was
for
this
conduct
that
i
incurred
your
hatred
because
i
did
not
allow
people
to
sell
you
wine
and
vegetables
and
fruit
for
gold
or
the
corn
which
had
been
locked
away
by
the
rich
in
their
granaries
to
be
suddenly
converted
by
you
into
silver
and
gold
for
their
benefit
for
they
managed
the
business
finely
outside
the
city
and
so
procured
for
men
famine
that
grinds
down
mortals
as
the
god
said
when
he
was
accusing
those
who
behave
in
this
fashion
and
the
city
now
enjoys
plenty
only
as
regards
bread
and
nothing
else

i

even

when

that
i

i

i

on

were

i

that
the

have

i
even

how
you
treated
one
another
when
you
asserted
your
rights
nine
years
ago
how
the
populace
with
loud
clamour
set
fire
to
the
houses
of
those
in
power
and
murdered
the
governor
and
how
later
they
were
punished
for
these
things
because
though
their
anger
was
justified
what
they
did
exceeded
all

why
i
repeat
in

s

am
i
treated
with
ingratitude
is
it
because
i
feed
you
from
my
own
purse
a
thing
which
before
this
day
has
never
happened
to
any
city
and
moreover
feed
you
so
generously
is
it
because
i
increased
the
register
of
senators
or
because
when
i
caught
you
in
the
act
of
stealing
i
did
not
proceed
against
you
let
me
if
you
please
remind
you
of
one
or
two
instances
so
that
no
one
may
think
that
what
i
say
is
a
pretext
or
mere
rhetoric
or
a
false
claim
you
said
i
think
that
three
thousand
lots
of
land
were
uncultivated
and
you
asked
to
have
them
and
when
you
had
got
them
you
all
divided
them
among
you
though
you
did
not
need
them
this
matter
was
investigated
and
brought
to
light
beyond
doubt
then
i
took
the
lots
away
from
those
who
held
them
unjustly
and
made
no
inquiries
about
the
lands
which
they
had
before
acquired
and
for
which
they
paid
no
taxes
though
they
ought
most
certainly
to
have
been
taxed
and
i
appointed
these
men
to
the
most
expensive
public
services
in
the
city
and
even
now
they
who
breed
horses
for
you
every
year
hold
nearly
three
thousand
lots
of
land
exempt
from
taxation
this
is
due
in
the
first
place
to
the
judgment
and
management
of
my
uncle
and
namesake
but
also
to
my
own
kindness
and
since
this
is
the
way
in
which
i
punish
rascals
and
thieves
i
naturally
seem
to
you
to
be
turning
the
world
upside
down
for
you
know
very
well
that
clemency
towards
men
of
this
sort
increases
and
fosters
wickedness
among
mankind
