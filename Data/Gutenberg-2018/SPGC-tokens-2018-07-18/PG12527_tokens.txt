since

that
reality
is
in
no

real
how
am

to

that

are

the

no
whether

be

or
whether
it
be
sweet
the
first
bite
tells
the
marriage
of
captain
the
honourable
geoffrey
barrington
and
miss
asako
fujinami
was
an
outstanding
event
in
the
season
of
it
was
bizarre
it
was
picturesque
it
was
charming
it
was
socially
and
politically
important
it
was
everything
that
could
appeal
to
the
taste
of
london
society
which
as
the
season
advances
is
apt
to
become
jaded
by
the
monotonous
process
of
hymen
in
high
life
and
by
the
continued
demand
for
costly
wedding
presents
once
again
society
paid
for
its
seat
at
george
and
for
its
glass
of
champagne
and
crumb
of
cake
with
gifts
of
gold
and
silver
and
precious
stones
enough
to
smother
the
tiny
bride
but
for
once
in
a
way
it
paid
with
a
good
heart
not
merely
in
obedience
to
convention
but
for
the
sake
of
participating
in
a
unique
and
delightful
scene
a
touching
ceremony
the
plighting
of
east
and
west
would
the
japanese
heiress
be
married
in
a
kimono
with
flowers
and
fans
fixed
in
an
elaborate
thus
the
ladies
were
wondering
as
they
craned
their
necks
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
procession
up
the
aisle
but
though
some
even
stood
on
hassocks
and
pew
seats
few
were
able
to
distinguish
for
certain
she
was
so
very
tiny
at
any
rate
her
six
tall
bridesmaids
were
arrayed
in
japanese
dress
lovely
white
creations
embroidered
with
birds
and
foliage
it
is
hard
to
distinguish
anything
in
the
perennial
twilight
of
george
a
twilight
symbolic
of
the
new
lives
which
emerge
from
its
corinthian
portico
into
that
married
world
about
which
so
much
has
been
guessed
and
so
little
is
known
one
thing
however
was
visible
to
all
as
the
pair
moved
together
up
to
the
altar
rails
and
that
was
the
size
of
the
bridegroom
as
contrasted
with
the
smallness
of
his
bride
he
looked
like
a
great
rough
bear
and
she
like
a
silver
fairy
there
was
something
intensely
pathetic
in
the
curve
of
his
broad
shoulders
as
he
bent
over
the
little
hand
to
place
in
its
proud
position
the
diminutive
golden
circlet
which
was
to
unite
their
two
lives
as
they
left
the
church
the
organ
was
playing
the
japanese
national
hymn
nobody
recognized
it
except
the
few
japanese
who
were
present
but
lady
everington
with
that
exaggeration
of
the
suitable
which
is
so
typical
of
her
had
insisted
on
its
choice
as
a
voluntary
those
who
had
heard
the
tune
before
and
half
remembered
it
decided
that
it
must
come
from
the
mikado
and
one
stern
dowager
went
so
far
as
to
protest
to
the
rector
for
permitting
such
a
tune
to
desecrate
the
sacred
edifice
outside
the
church
stood
the
bridegroom
brother
officers
through
the
gleaming
passage
of
smiling
and
happy
the
strangely
assorted
couple
entered
upon
the
way
of
wedlock
as
and
geoffrey
barrington
the
shoot
of
the
fujinami
grafted
on
to
one
of
the
oldest
of
our
noble
families
are
her
parents
here
one
lady
was
asking
her
neighbour
oh
no
they
are
both
dead
i
believe
what
kind
of
people
are
they
do
you
know
do
japs
have
an
aristocracy
and
society
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
i
sure
i
do
know
i
should
think
so
they
do
look
real
enough
she
is
very
rich
anyhow
a
third
lady
intervened
i
heard
they
are
big
landowners
in
tokyo
and
cousins
of
admiral
togo
the
opportunity
for
closer
inspection
of
this
curiosity
was
afforded
by
the
reception
given
at
lady
everington
mansion
in
carlton
house
terrace
of
course
everybody
was
there
the
great
ballroom
was
draped
with
hangings
of
red
and
white
the
national
colours
of
japan
favours
of
the
same
bright
hues
were
distributed
among
the
guests
trophies
of
union
jacks
and
rising
suns
were
grouped
in
corners
and
festooned
above
windows
and
doorways
lady
everington
was
bent
upon
giving
an
international
importance
to
her
protégée
marriage
her
original
plan
had
been
to
invite
the
whole
japanese
community
in
london
and
so
to
promote
the
popularity
of
the
alliance
by
making
the
most
of
this
opportunity
for
social
fraternising
but
where
was
the
japanese
community
in
london
nobody
knew
perhaps
there
was
none
there
was
the
embassy
of
course
which
arrived
smiling
fluent
and
almost
too
but
lady
everington
had
been
unable
to
push
very
far
her
programme
for
international
amenities
there
were
strange
little
yellow
men
from
the
city
who
had
charge
of
ships
and
banking
interests
there
were
strange
little
yellow
men
from
beyond
the
west
end
who
studied
the
fine
arts
and
lived
it
appeared
on
nothing
but
the
hostess
could
find
no
ladies
at
all
except
countess
saito
and
the
embassy
dames
monsieur
and
madame
murata
from
paris
the
bride
guardians
were
also
present
but
the
orient
was
submerged
beneath
the
flood
of
our
rank
and
fashion
which
as
one
lady
put
it
had
to
take
care
how
it
stepped
for
fear
of
crushing
the
little
creatures
why
you
let
him
do
it
said
markham
to
her
sister
it
was
a
mistake
my
dear
whispered
lady
everington
i
meant
her
for
somebody
quite
different
and
you
sorry
now
no
i
have
no
time
to
be
sorry
ever
replied
that
eternally
graceful
and
youthful
egeria
who
is
one
of
london
most
powerful
social
influences
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
what
becomes
of
them
lady
everington
has
been
criticised
for
for
opportunism
and
for
selfish
abuse
of
her
husband
vast
wealth
she
has
been
likened
to
an
experimental
chemist
who
mixes
discordant
elements
together
in
order
to
watch
the
results
chilling
them
in
ice
or
heating
them
over
the
fire
until
the
lives
burst
in
fragments
or
the
colour
slowly
fades
out
of
them
she
has
been
called
an
artist
in
a
of
dangerous
cunning
a
dangler
of
picturesque
before
cophetuas
a
daring
promoter
of
ambitious
american
girls
and
a
champion
of
musical
comedy
peeresses
her
house
has
been
named
the
junior
bachelors
club
the
charming
young
men
who
seem
to
be
bound
to
its
hospitable
board
by
invisible
chains
are
the
material
for
her
dashing
improvisations
and
the
of
the
scores
of
little
domestic
comedies
which
she
likes
to
keep
floating
around
her
in
different
stages
of
development
geoffrey
barrington
had
been
the
secretary
of
this
club
and
a
favourite
with
the
divinity
who
presided
over
it
we
had
all
supposed
that
he
would
remain
a
bachelor
and
the
advent
of
asako
fujinami
into
london
society
gave
us
at
first
no
reason
to
change
our
opinion
but
she
was
certainly
attractive
she
ought
to
have
been
married
in
a
kimono
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
now
when
there
was
more
liberty
to
inspect
her
as
she
stood
there
shaking
hands
with
hundreds
of
guests
and
murmuring
her
thank
you
very
much
to
the
reiterated
congratulations
the
white
gown
was
perfectly
cut
and
of
a
shade
to
give
its
full
value
to
her
complexion
a
waxen
complexion
like
old
ivory
or
like
a
magnolia
petal
in
which
the
mongolian
yellow
was
ever
so
faintly
discernible
it
was
a
sweet
little
face
oval
and
smooth
but
it
might
have
been
called
expressionless
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
dimple
which
peeped
and
vanished
around
a
corner
of
the
small
compressed
mouth
and
for
the
great
deep
brown
eyes
like
the
eyes
of
deer
or
like
pools
of
forest
water
eyes
full
of
warmth
and
affection
this
was
the
feature
which
struck
most
of
us
as
we
took
the
opportunity
to
watch
her
in
european
dress
with
the
glamour
of
her
kimono
stripped
from
her
they
were
the
eyes
of
the
oriental
girl
a
creature
closer
to
the
animals
than
we
are
lit
by
instinct
more
often
than
by
reason
and
hiding
a
soul
in
its
infancy
a
repressed
timorous
uncertain
thing
spasmodically
violent
and
habitually
secretive
and
aloof
sir
ralph
cairns
the
famous
diplomat
was
talking
on
this
subject
to
professor
ironside
the
japanese
are
extraordinarily
quick
he
was
saying
the
most
adaptable
people
since
the
ancient
greeks
whom
they
resemble
in
some
ways
but
they
are
more
superficial
the
intellect
races
on
ahead
but
the
heart
lingers
in
the
dark
ages
perhaps
intermarriage
is
the
solution
of
the
great
racial
problem
suggested
the
professor
never
said
the
old
administrator
keep
the
breed
pure
be
it
white
black
or
yellow
bastard
races
can
not
flourish
they
are
waste
of
nature
the
professor
glanced
towards
the
bridal
pair
and
these
also
he
asked
perhaps
said
sir
ralph
but
in
her
case
her
education
has
been
so
entirely
european
hereupon
lady
everington
approaching
sir
ralph
turned
to
her
and
said
dear
lady
let
me
congratulate
you
this
is
your
masterpiece
sir
ralph
said
the
hostess
already
looking
to
see
which
of
her
guests
she
would
next
pounce
upon
you
know
the
east
so
well
give
me
one
little
piece
of
advice
to
hand
over
to
the
children
before
they
start
on
their
honeymoon
sir
ralph
smiled
benignly
where
are
they
going
he
asked
everywhere
replied
lady
everington
they
are
going
to
travel
then
let
them
travel
all
over
the
world
he
answered
only
not
to
japan
that
is
their
bluebeard
cupboard
and
into
that
they
must
not
look
there
was
more
discussion
of
bridegroom
and
bride
than
is
usual
at
society
weddings
which
are
apt
to
become
mere
reunions
of
fashionable
people
only
vaguely
conscious
of
the
identity
of
those
in
whose
honour
they
have
been
gathered
together
geoffrey
barrington
is
such
a
healthy
barbarian
said
a
pale
young
man
with
a
monocle
if
it
had
been
a
child
of
culture
like
you
reggie
with
a
taste
for
exotic
sensations
i
should
hardly
have
been
surprised
and
if
it
had
been
you
arthur
replied
reggie
forsyth
of
the
foreign
office
who
was
barrington
best
man
i
should
have
known
at
once
that
it
was
the
twenty
thousand
a
year
which
was
the
supreme
attraction
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
sentiment
afloat
among
the
company
which
condemned
the
marriage
entirely
as
an
outrage
on
decency
what
was
brandan
dreaming
of
snorted
general
haslam
to
allow
his
son
to
marry
a
yellow
native
dreaming
of
the
mortgage
on
the
brandan
property
i
expect
general
answered
lady
rushworth
it
scandalous
foamed
the
general
a
fine
young
fellow
a
fine
officer
too
his
career
ruined
for
an
undersized
but
think
of
the
millions
of
or
or
whatever
they
are
with
which
she
is
going
to
the
brandan
coronet
that
would
console
me
for
a
yellow
baby
with
slit
eyes
continued
the
general
his
voice
rising
in
debate
as
his
custom
was
at
the
senior
hush
general
said
his
interlocutor
we
do
discuss
such
possibilities
but
everybody
here
must
be
thinking
of
them
except
that
unfortunate
young
man
we
never
say
what
we
are
thinking
general
it
would
be
too
upsetting
and
we
are
to
have
a
japanese
lord
brandan
sitting
in
the
house
of
lords
the
general
went
on
yes
among
the
jews
turks
and
armenians
who
are
there
already
lady
rushworth
answered
an
extra
oriental
will
never
be
noticed
it
will
only
be
another
instance
of
the
course
of
empire
taking
its
way
eastward
in
the
everington
the
wedding
presents
were
displayed
it
looked
more
like
the
interior
of
a
bond
street
shop
where
every
kind
of
de
useful
and
useless
was
heaped
in
plenty
perhaps
the
only
gift
which
had
cost
less
than
twenty
pounds
was
lady
everington
own
offering
a
photograph
of
herself
in
a
plain
silver
frame
her
customary
present
when
one
of
her
protégées
was
married
under
her
immediate
auspices
my
dear
she
would
say
i
have
enriched
you
by
several
thousands
of
pounds
i
have
introduced
you
to
the
right
people
for
at
precisely
the
right
moment
previous
to
your
wedding
when
they
know
you
neither
too
little
nor
too
much
by
long
experience
i
have
learnt
to
fix
it
to
a
day
but
i
am
not
going
to
compete
with
this
undistinguished
lavishness
i
give
you
my
picture
to
stand
in
your
as
an
artist
puts
his
signature
to
a
completed
masterpiece
so
that
when
you
look
around
upon
the
furniture
the
silver
the
cut
glass
the
clocks
the
engagement
tablets
and
the
tantalus
stands
the
offerings
of
the
rich
whose
names
you
have
long
ago
forgotten
then
you
will
confess
to
yourself
in
a
burst
of
thankfulness
to
your
fairy
godmother
that
all
this
would
never
have
been
yours
if
it
had
not
been
for
her
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
apart
from
the
more
ostentatious
homage
stood
on
a
small
table
a
large
in
which
was
lying
a
huge
red
fish
a
roguish
rollicking
mullet
with
a
roving
eye
all
made
out
of
a
soft
crinkly
silk
in
the
basket
beneath
it
were
rolls
and
rolls
of
plain
silk
red
and
white
this
was
an
offering
from
the
japanese
community
in
london
the
conventional
wedding
present
of
every
japanese
home
from
the
richest
to
the
poorest
varying
only
in
size
and
splendour
on
another
small
table
lay
a
bundle
of
brown
objects
like
prehistoric
axe
heads
bound
round
with
red
and
white
string
and
vaguely
odorous
of
these
were
dried
flesh
of
the
fish
called
by
the
japanese
whose
absence
also
would
have
brought
misfortune
to
the
newly
married
behind
them
on
a
little
tray
stood
a
miniature
landscape
representing
an
aged
by
the
and
a
little
cottage
with
a
couple
of
old
old
people
standing
at
its
door
two
exquisite
little
dolls
dressed
in
rough
poor
kimonos
brown
and
white
the
old
man
holds
a
rake
and
the
old
woman
holds
a
broom
they
have
very
kindly
faces
and
white
silken
hair
any
japanese
would
recognise
them
at
once
as
the
old
people
of
takasago
the
personification
of
the
perfect
marriage
they
are
staring
with
wonder
and
alarm
at
the
brandan
sapphires
a
monumental
designed
for
the
massive
state
of
some
lady
brandan
asako
fujinami
had
spent
days
rejoicing
over
the
arrival
of
her
presents
little
interested
in
the
identity
of
the
givers
but
fascinated
by
the
things
themselves
she
had
taken
hours
to
arrange
them
in
harmonious
groups
then
a
new
gift
would
arrive
which
would
upset
the
balance
and
she
would
have
to
begin
all
over
again
besides
this
treasury
in
the
there
were
all
her
clothes
packed
now
for
the
honeymoon
a
whole
wardrobe
of
disguises
wonderful
gowns
of
all
colours
and
shapes
and
materials
these
it
is
true
she
had
bought
herself
she
had
always
been
surrounded
by
money
but
it
was
only
since
she
had
lived
with
lady
everington
that
she
had
begun
to
learn
something
about
the
thousand
different
ways
of
spending
it
and
all
the
lovely
things
for
which
it
can
be
exchanged
so
all
her
new
things
whatever
their
source
seemed
to
her
like
presents
like
unexpected
enrichments
she
had
basked
among
her
new
acquisitions
silent
as
was
her
wont
when
she
was
happy
sunning
herself
in
the
warmth
of
her
prosperity
best
of
all
she
never
need
wear
kimonos
again
in
public
her
fiancé
had
acceded
to
this
her
most
immediate
wish
she
could
dress
now
like
the
girls
around
her
she
would
no
longer
be
stared
at
like
a
curio
in
a
shop
window
inquisitive
fingers
would
no
longer
clutch
at
the
long
sleeves
of
crinkled
silk
or
try
to
probe
the
secret
of
the
huge
butterfly
bow
on
her
back
she
could
step
out
fearlessly
now
like
english
women
she
could
give
up
the
mincing
walk
and
the
timid
manner
which
she
felt
was
somehow
inseparable
from
her
native
dress
when
she
told
her
protectress
that
geoffrey
had
consented
to
its
abandonment
lady
everington
had
heaved
a
sigh
poor
kimono
she
said
it
has
served
you
well
but
i
suppose
a
soldier
is
glad
to
put
his
uniform
away
when
the
fighting
is
over
only
never
forget
the
mysterious
power
of
the
uniform
over
the
other
sex
another
day
when
her
ladyship
had
been
in
a
bad
mood
she
had
snapped
put
those
things
away
child
and
keep
to
your
kimono
it
is
your
natural
plumage
in
those
borrowed
plumes
you
look
undistinguished
and
underfed
the
japanese
ambassador
to
the
court
of
james
proposed
the
health
of
the
bride
and
bridegroom
count
saito
was
a
small
wise
man
whom
long
sojourn
in
european
countries
had
to
some
extent
his
hair
was
grizzled
his
face
was
seamed
and
he
had
a
peering
way
of
gazing
through
his
spectacles
with
head
thrust
forward
like
a
man
half
blind
which
he
certainly
was
not
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
said
it
is
a
great
pleasure
for
me
to
be
present
on
this
occasion
for
i
think
this
wedding
is
a
personal
compliment
to
myself
and
to
my
work
in
this
splendid
country
and
geoffrey
barrington
are
the
living
symbols
of
the
alliance
and
i
hope
they
will
always
remember
the
responsibility
resting
on
their
shoulders
the
bride
and
bridegroom
of
must
feel
that
the
relations
of
great
britain
and
japan
depend
upon
the
perfect
harmony
of
their
married
life
ladies
and
gentlemen
let
us
drink
long
life
and
happiness
to
and
geoffrey
barrington
to
the
union
jack
and
to
the
rising
sun
the
toast
was
drunk
and
three
cheers
were
given
with
an
extra
cheer
for
geoffrey
the
husband
who
was
no
hand
at
speechmaking
replied
and
his
voice
was
quite
thick
with
emotion
that
it
was
awfully
good
of
them
all
to
give
his
wife
and
himself
such
a
ripping
and
awfully
good
of
sir
george
and
lady
everington
especially
and
awfully
good
of
count
saito
and
that
he
was
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
and
the
luckiest
and
that
his
wife
had
told
him
to
tell
them
all
that
she
was
the
happiest
woman
though
he
really
did
not
see
why
she
should
be
anyhow
he
would
do
his
best
to
give
her
a
jolly
good
time
he
thanked
his
friends
for
their
good
wishes
and
for
their
beautiful
presents
they
had
had
jolly
good
times
together
and
in
return
for
all
their
kindness
he
and
his
wife
wanted
to
wish
them
all
a
jolly
good
time
so
spoke
geoffrey
barrington
and
at
that
moment
many
people
present
must
have
felt
a
pang
of
regret
that
this
fine
specimen
of
young
manhood
should
marry
an
oriental
he
was
over
six
feet
high
his
broad
shoulders
seemed
to
stoop
a
little
with
the
lazy
strength
of
a
carnivore
of
una
lion
and
his
face
which
was
almost
round
was
set
off
by
a
mane
of
the
real
lion
colour
he
wore
his
moustache
rather
longer
than
was
the
fashion
it
was
a
face
which
seemed
ready
to
laugh
at
any
moment
or
else
to
yawn
for
there
was
about
the
man
character
and
appearance
something
indolent
and
and
much
of
the
schoolboy
yet
he
was
over
thirty
but
there
is
always
a
tendency
for
army
life
to
be
merely
a
continuation
of
existence
eton
merges
into
sandhurst
and
sandhurst
merges
into
the
regiment
one
companions
are
all
the
time
men
of
the
same
class
and
of
the
same
ideas
the
discipline
is
the
same
the
conventionality
and
the
presiding
fetish
of
good
and
bad
form
so
many
generals
are
perennial
school
boys
they
lose
their
freshness
that
is
all
but
geoffrey
barrington
had
not
lost
his
freshness
this
was
his
great
charm
for
he
certainly
was
not
quick
or
witty
lady
everington
said
that
she
kept
him
as
a
disinfectant
to
purify
the
atmosphere
this
house
she
declared
sometimes
gets
with
tuberoses
then
i
open
the
window
and
let
geoffrey
barrington
in
he
was
the
only
son
of
lord
brandan
and
heir
to
that
ancient
but
impoverished
title
he
had
been
brought
up
to
the
idea
that
he
must
marry
a
rich
wife
he
neither
jibbed
foolishly
at
the
proposal
nor
did
he
surrender
lightly
to
any
of
the
willing
heiresses
who
threw
themselves
at
his
head
he
accepted
his
destiny
with
the
fatalism
which
every
soldier
must
carry
in
his
knapsack
and
took
up
his
post
as
mars
in
attendance
in
lady
everington
recognising
that
there
lay
the
strategic
point
for
achieving
his
purpose
he
was
not
without
hope
too
that
besides
obtaining
the
moneybags
he
might
be
so
fortunate
as
to
fall
in
love
with
the
possessor
of
them
asako
fujinami
whom
he
had
first
met
at
dinner
at
lady
everington
had
crossed
his
mind
just
like
an
exquisite
bar
of
melody
he
made
no
comments
at
the
time
but
he
could
not
forget
her
the
haunting
tune
came
back
to
him
again
and
again
by
the
time
that
she
had
floated
in
his
arms
through
three
or
four
dances
the
spell
had
worked
belle
dame
sans
the
enchantress
who
lurks
in
every
woman
had
him
in
thrall
her
simplest
observations
seemed
to
him
to
be
pearls
of
wisdom
her
every
movement
a
triumph
of
grace
reggie
he
said
to
his
friend
forsyth
what
do
you
think
of
that
little
japanese
girl
reggie
who
was
a
diplomat
by
profession
and
a
musician
by
the
grace
of
god
and
whose
intuition
was
almost
feminine
especially
where
geoffrey
was
concerned
answered
why
geoffrey
are
you
thinking
of
marrying
her
by
jove
exclaimed
his
friend
starting
at
the
thought
as
at
a
discovery
but
i
do
think
she
have
me
i
not
her
sort
you
never
can
tell
suggested
reggie
mischievously
she
is
quite
unspoilt
and
she
has
twenty
thousand
a
year
she
is
unique
you
could
not
possibly
get
her
confused
with
somebody
else
wife
as
so
many
people
seem
to
do
when
they
get
married
why
not
try
reggie
thought
that
such
a
mating
was
impossible
but
it
amused
him
to
play
with
the
idea
as
for
lady
everington
who
knew
every
one
so
well
and
who
thought
that
she
knew
them
perfectly
she
never
guessed
i
think
geoffrey
that
you
like
to
be
seen
with
asako
she
said
just
to
point
the
contrast
her
confession
to
her
sister
markham
was
the
truth
she
had
made
a
mistake
she
had
destined
asako
for
somebody
quite
different
it
was
the
girl
herself
who
had
been
the
first
to
enlighten
her
she
came
to
her
hostess
boudoir
one
evening
before
the
labours
of
the
night
began
lady
georgie
she
had
said
lady
everington
is
lady
georgie
to
all
who
know
her
even
a
little
faut
que
je
vous
dise
quelque
the
girl
face
glanced
downward
and
sideways
as
her
habit
was
when
embarrassed
when
asako
spoke
in
french
it
meant
that
something
grave
was
afoot
she
was
afraid
that
her
unsteady
english
might
muddle
what
she
intended
to
say
lady
everington
knew
that
it
must
be
another
proposal
she
had
already
dealt
with
three
bien
cette
fois
qui
she
asked
capitaine
answered
asako
then
her
friend
knew
that
it
was
serious
what
did
you
say
to
him
she
demanded
i
tell
him
he
must
ask
you
but
why
drag
me
into
it
it
your
own
affair
in
france
and
in
japan
said
asako
a
girl
do
not
say
yes
and
no
herself
it
is
her
father
and
her
mother
who
decide
i
have
no
father
or
mother
so
i
think
he
must
ask
you
and
what
do
you
want
me
to
say
for
answer
asako
gently
squeezed
the
elder
woman
hand
but
lady
georgie
was
in
no
mood
to
return
the
pressure
the
girl
at
once
felt
the
absence
of
the
response
and
said
what
you
do
not
like
the
but
her
fairy
godmother
answered
bitterly
on
the
contrary
i
have
a
considerable
affection
for
geoffrey
then
cried
asako
starting
up
you
think
i
am
not
good
enough
for
him
it
because
i
not
english
she
began
to
cry
in
spite
of
her
superficial
hardness
lady
everington
has
a
very
tender
heart
she
took
the
girl
in
her
arms
dearest
child
she
said
raising
the
little
moist
face
to
hers
do
cry
in
england
we
answer
this
great
question
ourselves
our
fathers
and
mothers
and
fairy
godmothers
have
to
concur
if
geoffrey
barrington
has
asked
you
to
marry
him
it
is
because
he
loves
you
he
does
not
scatter
proposals
like
as
some
young
men
do
in
fact
i
have
never
heard
of
him
proposing
to
anyone
before
he
does
not
want
you
to
say
of
course
but
are
you
quite
ready
to
say
very
well
wait
a
fortnight
and
do
see
more
of
him
than
you
can
help
in
the
meantime
now
let
them
send
for
my
there
is
nothing
so
exhausting
to
the
aged
as
the
emotions
of
young
people
that
evening
when
lady
everington
met
geoffrey
at
the
theatre
she
took
him
severely
to
task
for
treachery
secrecy
and
decadence
he
was
very
humble
and
admitted
all
his
faults
except
the
last
pleading
as
his
excuse
that
he
could
not
get
asako
out
of
his
head
yes
that
is
a
symptom
said
her
ladyship
you
are
clearly
stricken
so
i
fear
i
am
too
late
to
effect
a
rescue
all
i
can
do
is
to
congratulate
you
both
but
remember
a
wife
is
not
nearly
so
fugitive
as
a
melody
unless
she
is
the
wrong
kind
of
wife
it
was
a
wrench
for
the
little
lady
to
part
with
the
oldest
of
her
friendships
and
to
give
up
her
geoffrey
to
the
care
of
this
decorative
stranger
whose
qualities
were
unknown
and
undeveloped
but
she
knew
what
the
answer
would
be
at
the
end
of
the
fortnight
so
she
steeled
her
nerves
to
laugh
at
her
friends
commiserations
and
to
make
the
marriage
of
her
godchildren
one
of
the
season
successes
it
would
certainly
be
an
interesting
addition
to
her
museum
of
domestic
dramas
there
was
one
person
whom
lady
everington
was
determined
to
pump
for
information
on
that
and
had
drawn
into
the
net
of
her
invitations
for
this
very
purpose
it
was
count
saito
the
japanese
ambassador
she
cornered
him
as
he
was
admiring
the
presents
and
whisked
him
away
to
the
silence
and
twilight
of
her
husband
study
i
am
so
glad
you
were
able
to
come
count
saito
she
began
i
suppose
you
know
the
fujinamis
asako
relatives
in
tokyo
no
i
do
not
know
them
his
excellency
answered
but
his
tone
conveyed
to
the
lady
instinct
that
he
personally
would
not
wish
to
know
them
but
you
know
the
name
do
you
not
yes
i
have
heard
the
name
there
are
many
families
called
fujinami
in
japan
are
they
very
rich
yes
i
believe
there
are
some
who
are
very
rich
said
the
little
diplomat
who
clearly
was
ill
at
ease
where
does
their
money
come
from
his
inquisitor
went
on
remorselessly
you
are
keeping
something
from
me
count
saito
please
be
frank
if
there
is
any
mystery
oh
no
lady
everington
there
is
no
mystery
i
am
sure
there
is
one
family
of
fujinami
who
have
many
houses
and
lands
in
tokyo
and
other
towns
i
will
be
quite
open
with
you
they
are
rather
what
you
in
england
call
really
her
ladyship
was
taken
aback
for
a
moment
but
you
would
never
notice
it
with
asako
would
you
i
mean
she
does
not
drop
her
japanese
aitches
and
that
sort
of
thing
does
she
oh
no
count
saito
reassured
her
i
do
not
think
mademoiselle
asako
talks
japanese
language
so
she
can
not
drop
her
aitches
i
never
thought
of
that
his
hostess
continued
i
thought
that
if
a
japanese
had
money
he
must
be
a
or
something
the
ambassador
smiled
english
people
he
said
do
not
know
very
well
the
true
condition
of
japan
of
course
we
have
our
rich
new
families
and
our
poor
old
families
just
as
you
have
in
england
in
some
aspects
our
society
is
just
the
same
as
yours
in
others
it
is
so
different
that
you
would
lose
your
way
at
once
in
a
maze
of
ideas
which
would
seem
to
you
quite
upside
down
lady
everington
interrupted
his
reflections
in
a
desperate
attempt
to
get
something
out
of
him
by
a
surprise
attack
how
interesting
she
said
it
will
be
for
geoffrey
harrington
and
his
wife
to
visit
japan
and
find
out
all
about
it
the
ambassador
manner
changed
no
i
do
not
think
he
said
i
do
not
think
that
is
a
good
thing
at
all
they
must
not
do
that
you
must
not
let
them
but
why
not
i
say
to
all
japanese
men
and
women
who
live
a
long
time
in
foreign
countries
or
who
marry
foreign
people
not
go
back
to
japan
japan
is
like
a
little
pot
and
the
foreign
world
is
like
a
big
garden
if
you
plant
a
tree
from
the
pot
into
the
garden
and
let
it
grow
you
can
not
put
it
back
into
the
pot
again
but
in
this
case
that
is
not
the
only
reason
objected
lady
everington
no
there
are
many
other
reasons
too
the
ambassador
admitted
and
he
rose
from
his
sofa
indicating
that
the
interview
was
at
an
end
the
bridal
pair
left
in
a
for
folkestone
tinder
a
hailstorm
of
rice
and
with
the
propitious
white
slipper
dangling
from
the
behind
when
all
her
guests
were
gone
lady
everington
fled
to
her
boudoir
and
collapsed
in
a
little
heap
of
sobbing
finery
on
the
broad
divan
she
was
overtired
no
doubt
but
the
sense
of
her
mistake
lay
heavy
upon
her
and
the
feeling
that
she
had
sacrificed
to
it
her
best
friend
the
most
humanly
valuable
of
all
the
people
who
resorted
to
her
house
an
evil
cloud
of
mystery
hung
over
the
young
marriage
one
of
those
sinister
unfamiliar
forces
which
travellers
bring
home
from
the
east
the
curse
of
a
god
or
a
secret
poison
or
a
hideous
disease
it
would
be
so
natural
for
those
two
to
want
to
visit
japan
and
to
know
their
second
home
yet
both
sir
ralph
cairns
and
count
saito
the
only
two
men
that
day
who
knew
anything
about
the
real
conditions
had
insisted
that
such
a
visit
would
be
fatal
and
who
were
these
fujinamis
whom
count
saito
knew
but
did
not
know
why
had
she
who
was
so
socially
careful
taken
so
much
for
granted
just
because
asako
was

now
free
to

of
travelling
abroad

among

on
the
brandan
estate
for
lord
brandan
was
an
unpleasing
old
gentleman
a
frequenter
of
country
bars
and
country
barmaids
his
son
wished
to
keep
his
young
bride
as
far
away
as
possible
from
a
spectacle
of
which
he
was
heartily
ashamed
first
of
all
they
went
to
paris
which
asako
adored
for
was
it
not
her
home
but
this
time
she
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
paris
unknown
to
her
save
by
rumour
in
the
convent
days
or
within
the
discreet
precincts
of
monsieur
murata
villa
she
was
enchanted
by
the
theatres
the
shops
the
restaurants
the
music
and
the
life
which
danced
around
her
she
wanted
to
rent
an
and
to
live
there
for
the
rest
of
her
existence
but
the
season
is
almost
over
said
her
husband
everybody
will
be
leaving
unaccustomed
as
yet
to
his
freedom
he
still
felt
constrained
to
do
the
same
as
everybody
before
leaving
paris
they
paid
a
visit
to
the
auteuil
villa
which
had
been
asako
home
for
so
many
years
murata
was
the
manager
of
a
big
japanese
firm
in
paris
he
had
spent
almost
all
his
life
abroad
and
the
last
twenty
years
of
it
in
the
french
capital
so
that
even
in
appearance
except
for
his
short
stature
and
his
tilted
eyes
he
had
come
to
look
like
a
frenchman
with
his
beard
and
his
quick
gestures
his
wife
was
a
japanese
but
she
too
had
lost
almost
all
traces
of
her
native
mannerisms
asako
fujinami
had
been
brought
to
paris
by
her
father
who
had
died
there
while
still
a
young
man
he
had
entrusted
his
only
child
to
the
care
of
the
muratas
with
instructions
that
she
should
be
educated
in
european
ways
and
ideas
that
she
should
hold
no
communication
with
her
relatives
in
japan
and
that
eventually
a
white
husband
should
be
provided
for
her
he
had
left
his
whole
fortune
in
trust
for
her
and
the
interest
was
forwarded
regularly
to
murata
by
a
tokyo
lawyer
to
be
used
for
her
benefit
as
her
guardian
might
deem
best
this
money
was
to
be
the
only
tie
between
asako
and
her
native
land
to
cut
off
a
child
from
its
family
of
which
by
virtue
of
vested
interests
it
must
still
be
an
important
member
was
a
proceeding
so
revolutionary
to
all
respectable
japanese
ideas
that
even
the
enlightened
murata
demurred
in
japan
the
individual
counts
for
so
little
the
family
for
so
much
but
fujinami
had
insisted
and
disobedience
to
a
man
dying
wish
brings
the
curse
of
a
rough
ghost
upon
the
recalcitrant
and
all
kinds
of
evil
consequences
so
the
muratas
took
asako
and
cherished
her
as
much
as
their
hearts
withered
by
exile
and
by
unnatural
living
were
capable
of
cherishing
anything
she
became
a
daughter
of
the
french
strictly
but
affectionately
disciplined
with
the
proper
restraints
on
the
natural
growth
of
her
brain
and
individuality
geoffrey
barrington
was
not
very
favourably
impressed
by
the
murata
household
he
wondered
how
so
bright
a
little
flower
as
asako
could
have
been
reared
in
such
gloomy
surroundings
the
spirits
dominant
in
the
villa
were
respectable
economy
and
slavish
imitation
of
the
tastes
and
habits
of
parisian
friends
the
were
as
impersonal
as
the
rooms
of
a
neutral
tints
abounded
ugly
browns
and
nightmare
vegetable
patterns
on
carpets
furniture
and
wallpapers
there
was
a
marked
tendency
towards
covers
covers
for
the
chairs
and
sofas
tablecloths
and
covers
for
the
tablecloths
covers
for
antimacassars
and
every
kind
of
decorative
duster
everywhere
the
thick
smell
of
concealed
grime
told
of
insufficient
servants
and
ineffective
sweeping
there
was
not
one
ornament
or
picture
which
recalled
japan
or
gave
a
clue
to
the
personal
tastes
of
the
owners
geoffrey
had
expected
to
be
the
nervous
witness
of
an
affecting
scene
between
his
wife
and
her
adopted
parents
but
no
the
greetings
were
polite
and
formal
asako
frock
and
jewellery
were
admired
but
without
that
note
of
angry
envy
which
often
brightens
the
dullest
talk
between
ladies
in
england
then
they
sat
down
to
an
atrocious
lunch
eaten
in
complete
silence
when
the
meal
was
over
murata
drew
geoffrey
aside
into
his
shingly
garden
i
think
that
you
will
be
content
with
our
asa
san
he
said
the
character
is
still
plastic
in
england
it
is
different
but
in
france
and
in
japan
we
say
it
is
the
husband
who
must
make
the
character
of
his
wife
she
is
the
plain
white
paper
let
him
take
his
brush
and
write
on
it
what
he
will
asa
san
is
a
very
sweet
girl
she
is
very
easy
to
manage
she
has
a
beautiful
disposition
she
does
not
tell
lies
without
reason
she
does
not
wish
to
make
strange
friends
i
do
not
think
you
will
have
trouble
with
her
he
talks
about
her
rather
as
if
she
were
a
horse
thought
geoffrey
murata
went
on
the
japanese
woman
is
the
ivy
which
clings
to
the
tree
she
does
not
wish
to
disobey
you
think
asako
is
still
very
japanese
then
asked
geoffrey
not
her
manners
or
her
looks
or
even
her
thoughts
replied
murata
but
nothing
can
change
the
heart
then
do
you
think
she
is
homesick
sometimes
for
japan
said
her
husband
oh
no
smiled
murata
the
little
wizened
man
was
full
of
smiles
she
left
japan
when
she
was
not
two
years
old
she
remembers
nothing
at
all
i
think
one
day
we
shall
go
to
japan
said
geoffrey
when
we
get
tired
of
europe
you
know
it
is
a
wonderful
country
i
am
told
and
it
does
not
seem
right
that
asako
should
know
nothing
about
it
besides
i
should
like
to
look
into
her
affairs
and
find
out
about
her
investments
murata
was
staring
at
his
yellow
boots
with
an
embarrassed
air
it
suddenly
struck
the
englishman
that
he
geoffrey
harrington
was
related
to
people
who
looked
like
that
and
who
now
had
the
right
to
call
him
cousin
he
shivered
you
can
trust
her
lawyers
said
the
japanese
ito
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
you
may
be
quite
certain
that
asako
money
is
safe
oh
yes
of
course
assented
geoffrey
but
what
exactly
are
her
investments
i
think
i
ought
to
know
murata
began
to
laugh
nervously
as
all
japanese
do
when
embarrassed
he
exclaimed
but
i
do
not
know
myself
the
money
has
been
paid
regularly
for
nearly
twenty
years
and
i
know
the
fujinami
are
very
rich
indeed
captain
barrington
i
do
not
think
asako
would
like
japan
it
was
her
father
last
wish
that
she
should
never
return
there
but
why
asked
geoffrey
he
felt
that
murata
was
keeping
something
from
him
the
little
man
answered
he
thought
that
for
a
woman
the
life
is
more
happy
in
europe
he
wished
asako
to
forget
altogether
that
she
was
japanese
yes
but
now
she
is
married
and
her
future
is
fixed
she
is
not
going
back
permanently
to
japan
but
just
to
see
the
country
i
think
we
would
both
of
us
like
to
people
say
it
is
a
magnificent
country
you
are
very
kind
said
murata
to
speak
so
of
my
country
but
the
foreign
people
who
marry
japanese
are
happy
if
they
stay
in
their
own
country
and
japanese
who
marry
foreigners
are
happy
if
they
go
away
from
japan
but
if
they
stay
in
japan
they
are
not
happy
the
national
atmosphere
in
japan
is
too
strong
for
those
people
who
are
not
japanese
or
are
only
half
japanese
they
fade
besides
life
in
japan
is
very
poor
and
rough
i
do
not
like
it
myself
somehow
geoffrey
could
not
accept
these
as
being
the
real
reasons
he
had
never
had
a
long
talk
with
a
japanese
man
before
but
he
felt
that
if
they
were
all
like
that
so
formal
so
unnatural
so
secretive
then
he
had
better
keep
out
of
the
range
of
asako
relatives
he
wondered
what
his
wife
really
thought
of
the
muratas
and
during
the
return
to
their
hotel
he
asked
well
little
girl
do
you
want
to
go
back
again
and
live
at
auteuil
she
shook
her
head
but
it
is
nice
to
think
you
have
always
got
an
extra
home
in
paris
is
it
he
went
on
fishing
for
an
avowal
that
home
was
in
his
arms
only
a
kind
of
conversation
which
was
the
wine
of
life
to
him
at
that
period
no
she
answered
with
a
little
shudder
i
do
call
that
home
geoffrey
conventionality
was
a
little
bit
shocked
at
this
lack
of
affection
he
was
also
disappointed
at
not
getting
exactly
the
expected
answer
why
what
was
wrong
with
it
he
asked
oh
it
was
not
pretty
or
comfortable
she
said
they
were
so
afraid
to
spend
money
when
i
wash
my
hands
they
say
not
use
too
much
soap
it
is
waste
asako
was
like
a
little
prisoner
released
into
the
sunlight
she
dreaded
the
idea
of
being
thrust
back
into
darkness
again
in
this
new
life
of
hers
anything
would
have
made
her
happy
that
is
to
say
anything
new
anything
given
to
her
anything
good
to
eat
or
drink
anything
soft
and
shimmery
to
wear
anything
so
long
as
her
big
husband
was
with
her
he
was
the
most
fascinating
of
all
her
novelties
he
was
much
nicer
than
lady
everington
for
he
was
not
always
saying
do
or
making
clever
remarks
which
she
could
not
understand
he
gave
her
absolutely
her
own
way
and
everything
that
she
admired
he
reminded
her
of
an
old
newfoundland
dog
who
had
been
her
slave
when
she
was
a
little
girl
he
used
to
play
with
her
as
he
would
have
played
with
a
child
watching
her
as
she
tried
on
her
finery
hiding
things
for
her
to
find
holding
them
over
her
head
and
making
her
jump
for
them
like
a
puppy
arranging
her
ornaments
for
her
in
those
continual
private
exhibitions
which
took
up
so
much
of
her
time
then
she
would
ring
the
bell
and
summon
all
the
chambermaids
within
call
to
come
and
admire
and
geoffrey
would
stand
among
all
these
womenfolk
listening
to
the
chorus
of
dieu
and
que
beau
and
est
gentille
like
some
hector
who
had
strayed
into
the
of
priam
palace
he
felt
a
little
foolish
perhaps
but
very
happy
happy
in
his
wife
naive
happiness
and
affection
which
did
not
require
any
mental
effort
to
understand
nor
that
panting
pursuit
on
which
he
had
embarked
more
than
once
in
order
to
keep
up
with
the
witty
flirtatiousness
of
some
of
the
beauties
of
lady
happiness
shone
out
of
asako
like
light
but
would
she
always
be
happy
there
were
the
possibilities
of
the
future
to
be
reckoned
with
sickness
childbirth
and
the
rearing
of
children
the
hidden
development
of
the
character
which
so
often
grows
away
from
what
it
once
cherished
the
baleful
currents
of
outside
influences
the
attraction
and
repulsion
of
friends
and
enemies
all
of
which
complicate
the
primitive
simplicity
of
married
life
and
forfeit
the
honeymoon
eden
adam
and
eve
in
the
garden
of
the
creation
can
hear
the
voice
of
god
whispering
in
the
evening
breeze
they
can
live
without
jars
and
ambitions
without
suspicion
and
without
reproaches
they
have
no
parents
no
no
brothers
sisters
aunts
or
guardians
no
friends
to
lay
the
train
of
scandal
or
to
be
continually
pulling
them
from
each
other
arms
but
the
first
influence
which
crosses
the
walls
of
their
paradise
the
first
being
to
whom
they
speak
which
possesses
the
semblance
of
a
human
voice
is
most
certainly
satan
and
that
old
serpent
who
was
a
liar
and
a
slanderer
from
the
beginning
and
whose
counsels
will
lead
inevitably
to
the
withdrawal
of
god
presence
and
to
the
doom
of
a
life
of
pain
and
labor
there
was
one
cloud
in
the
heaven
of
their
happiness
geoffrey
was
inclined
to
tease
asako
about
her
native
country
his
ideas
about
japan
were
gleaned
chiefly
from
musical
comedies
he
would
call
his
wife
yum
yum
and
pitti
sing
he
would
fix
the
end
of
one
of
her
black
veils
under
his
hat
and
would
ask
her
whether
she
liked
him
better
with
a
pigtail
captain
geoffrey
she
would
complain
it
is
the
chinese
who
wear
the
pigtail
they
are
a
very
savage
people
then
he
would
call
her
his
little
and
this
she
resented
for
she
knew
from
the
muratas
that
were
bad
women
who
took
husbands
away
from
their
wives
and
that
was
no
joking
matter
what
nonsense
exclaimed
geoffrey
taken
aback
by
this
sudden
reproof
they
are
dear
little
things
like
you
darling
and
they
bring
you
tea
and
wave
fans
behind
your
head
and
i
would
like
to
have
twenty
of
them
to
wait
upon
you
he
would
tease
her
about
a
supposed
fondness
for
rice
for
for
paper
umbrellas
and
she
liked
him
to
tease
her
just
as
a
child
likes
to
be
teased
while
all
the
time
on
the
verge
of
tears
with
asako
tears
and
laughter
were
never
far
apart
why
do
you
tease
me
because
i
am
japanese
she
would
sob
besides
i
not
really
i
ca
help
it
i
ca
help
it
but
sweetheart
her
captain
geoffrey
would
say
suddenly
ashamed
of
his
elephantine
humour
there
nothing
to
cry
about
i
would
be
proud
to
be
a
japanese
they
are
jolly
brave
people
they
gave
the
russians
a
jolly
good
hiding
it
made
her
feel
well
to
hear
him
praise
her
people
but
she
would
say
no
no
they
not
i
do
want
to
be
a
jap
i
do
like
them
they
ugly
and
spiteful
why
ca
we
choose
what
we
are
i
would
be
an
english
girl
or
perhaps
french
she
added
thinking
of
the
rue
de
la
paix
they
left
paris
and
went
to
deauville
and
here
it
was
that
the
serpent
first
crawled
into
eden
whispering
of
forbidden
fruit
these
serpents
were
charming
people
amusing
men
and
smart
women
all
anxious
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
latest
sensation
the
japanese
millionairess
and
her
husband
asako
lunched
with
them
and
dined
with
them
and
sat
with
them
near
the
sea
in
wonderful
bathing
costumes
which
it
would
be
a
shame
to
wet
conscious
of
the
shortcomings
of
her
figure
as
compared
with
those
of
the
lissom
mermaids
who
surrounded
her
asako
returned
to
kimonos
much
to
her
husband
surprise
and
the
mermaids
had
to
confess
themselves
beaten
she
listened
to
their
talk
and
learned
a
hundred
things
but
another
hundred
at
least
remained
hidden
from
her
geoffrey
left
his
wife
to
amuse
herself
in
the
cosmopolitan
society
of
the
french
he
wanted
this
all
the
wives
whom
he
had
ever
known
seemed
to
enjoy
themselves
best
when
away
from
their
husbands
company
he
did
not
quite
trust
the
spirit
of
mutual
adoration
which
the
gods
had
given
to
him
and
his
bride
perhaps
it
was
an
unhealthy
symptom
worse
still
it
might
be
bad
form
he
wanted
asako
to
be
natural
and
to
enjoy
herself
and
not
to
make
their
love
into
a
prison
house
but
he
felt
a
bit
lonely
when
he
was
away
from
her
occupation
did
not
seem
to
come
easily
to
him
as
it
did
when
she
was
there
to
suggest
it
sometimes
he
would
loaf
up
and
down
on
the
esplanade
and
sometimes
he
would
take
strenuous
swims
in
the
sea
he
became
the
prey
of
the
bores
who
haunt
every
seaside
place
at
home
and
abroad
lurking
for
lonely
and
polite
people
upon
whom
they
may
unload
their
conversation
all
these
people
seemed
either
to
have
been
in
japan
themselves
or
to
have
friends
and
relations
who
knew
the
country
thoroughly
a
wonderful
land
they
assured
him
the
nation
of
the
future
the
garden
of
the
east
but
of
course
captain
barrington
knew
japan
well
no
he
had
never
been
there
ah
but
barrington
must
have
described
it
all
to
him
impossible
really
not
since
she
was
a
baby
how
very
extraordinary
a
charming
country
so
quaint
so
original
so
picturesque
such
a
place
to
relax
in
and
then
the
japanese
girls
the
little
in
their
bright
kimonos
who
came
fluttering
round
like
little
butterflies
who
were
so
gentle
and
soft
and
grateful
but
there
captain
barrington
was
a
married
man
that
was
no
affair
of
his
ha
ha
the
elderly
who
buzzed
like
february
flies
in
the
sunshine
of
deauville
seemed
to
have
particularly
fruity
memories
of
sprees
and
oriental
philanderings
under
the
of
yokohama
evidently
japan
was
just
like
the
musical
comedies
geoffrey
began
to
be
ashamed
of
his
ignorance
concerning
his
native
country
somebody
had
asked
him
what
exactly
was
he
had
answered
at
random
that
it
was
made
of
rice
and
curry
powder
by
the
hilarious
reception
given
to
this
explanation
he
knew
that
he
must
have
made
a
so
he
asked
one
of
the
more
erudite
bores
to
give
him
the
names
of
the
best
books
about
japan
he
would
mug
it
up
and
get
some
answers
off
pat
to
the
leading
questions
the
erudite
one
promptly
lent
him
some
volumes
by
lafcadio
hearn
and
pierre
he
read
the
novel
first
of
all
rather
spicy
was
it
asako
found
the
book
it
was
an
illustrated
edition
and
the
little
drawings
of
japanese
scenes
pleased
her
immensely
so
that
she
began
to
read
the
letter
press
it
is
the
story
of
a
bad
man
and
a
bad
woman
she
said
geoffrey
why
do
you
read
bad
things
they
bring
bad
conditions
geoffrey
smiled
he
was
wondering
whether
the
company
of
the
fictitious
was
more
demoralizing
than
that
of
the
actual
mme
laroche
meyerbeer
with
whom
his
wife
had
been
that
day
for
a
picnic
lunch
besides
it
is
fair
his
wife
continued
people
read
that
book
and
then
they
think
that
all
japanese
girls
are
bad
like
that
why
darling
i
did
think
you
had
read
it
geoffrey
expostulated
who
has
been
telling
you
about
it
the
vicomte
de
brie
asako
answered
he
called
me
and
i
asked
him
why
oh
did
he
said
geoffrey
really
it
was
time
to
put
an
end
to
lunch
picnics
and
mermaidism
but
asako
was
so
happy
and
so
shiningly
innocent
she
returned
to
her
circle
of
admirers
and
geoffrey
to
his
studies
of
the
far
east
he
read
the
lafcadio
hearn
books
and
did
not
perceive
that
he
was
taking
opium
the
wonderful
sentences
of
that
master
of
prose
poetry
rise
before
the
eyes
in
whorls
of
narcotic
smoke
they
lull
the
brain
as
in
a
dream
and
form
themselves
gradually
into
visions
of
a
land
more
beautiful
than
any
land
that
has
ever
existed
anywhere
a
country
of
vivid
rice
plains
and
sudden
hills
of
gracious
forests
and
red
temple
gateways
of
wise
priests
and
imagery
of
a
smiling
people
with
children
bright
as
flowers
laughing
and
playing
in
unfailing
sunlight
a
country
where
everything
is
kind
gentle
small
neat
artistic
and
spotlessly
clean
where
men
become
gods
not
by
sudden
apotheosis
but
by
the
easy
processes
of
nature
a
country
in
short
which
is
the
reverse
of
our
own
poor
vexed
continent
where
the
monstrous
and
the
hideous
multiply
daily
one
afternoon
geoffrey
was
lounging
on
the
terrace
of
the
hotel
reading
when
his
attention
was
attracted
by
the
arrival
of
mme
laroche
meyerbeer
with
asako
her
hostess
and
another
woman
embedded
in
its
depths
asako
was
the
first
to
leap
out
she
went
up
to
her
apartment
without
looking
to
right
or
left
and
before
her
husband
had
time
to
reach
her
mme
meyerbeer
watched
this
arrow
flight
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
before
lazily
alighting
is
all
well
asked
geoffrey
no
serious
damage
smiled
the
lady
who
is
known
in
deauville
as
but
you
had
better
go
and
console
her
i
think
she
has
seen
the
devil
for
the
first
time
he
opened
the
door
of
their
sunny
bedroom
and
found
asako
packing
feverishly
and
sobbing
in
spasms
my
poor
little
darling
he
said
lifting
her
in
his
arms
whatever
is
the
matter
he
laid
her
on
the
sofa
took
off
her
hat
and
loosened
her
dress
until
gradually
she
became
coherent
he
tried
to
kiss
me
she
sobbed
who
did
her
husband
asked
the
vicomte
de
brie
damned
little
monkey
cried
geoffrey
i
break
every
miserable
bone
in
his
pretence
of
a
body
oh
no
no
protested
asako
let
us
go
away
from
here
at
once
let
us
go
to
switzerland
anywhere
the
serpent
had
got
into
the
garden
but
he
had
not
been
a
very
adroit
reptile
he
had
shown
his
fangs
and
the
woman
had
promptly
bruised
his
head
and
had
given
him
an
eye
like
an
impressionist
sunset
which
for
several
days
he
had
to
hide
from
the
ridicule
of
his
friends
but
asako
too
had
been
grievously
injured
in
the
innocence
of
her
heart
and
it
took
all
the
snow
winds
of
the
engadine
to
blow
away
from
her
face
the
hot
defilement
of
the
man
breath
she
clung
closely
to
her
husband
protection
she
who
had
hitherto
abandoned
herself
to
excessive
amiability
barbed
the
walls
of
their
violated
paradise
with
the
broken
glass
of
bare
civility
every
man
became
suspect
the
german
professors
culling
alpine
plants
the
mountain
maniacs
with
their
eyes
fixed
on
peaks
to
conquer
she
had
no
word
for
any
of
them
even
the
manlike
womenfolk
who
golfed
and
rowed
and
clambered
were
to
her
indignant
eyes
dangerous
panders
to
the
lusts
of
men
disguised
allies
of
are
they
all
bad
she
asked
geoffrey
no
little
girl
i
do
suppose
so
they
look
too
dismal
to
be
bad
geoffrey
was
grateful
for
the
turn
of
events
which
had
delivered
up
his
wife
again
into
his
sole
company
he
had
missed
her
society
more
than
he
dared
confess
for
uxoriousness
is
a
pitiful
attitude
in
fact
it
is
bad
form
at
this
period
he
wanted
her
as
a
kind
of
mirror
for
his
own
mind
and
for
his
own
person
she
saw
to
it
that
his
clothes
were
spotless
and
that
his
tie
was
straight
of
course
he
always
dressed
for
dinner
even
when
they
dined
in
their
room
she
too
would
dress
herself
up
in
her
new
finery
for
his
eyes
alone
she
would
listen
to
him
laying
down
the
law
on
subjects
which
he
would
not
dare
broach
were
he
talking
to
any
one
else
she
flattered
him
in
that
silent
way
which
is
so
soothing
to
a
man
of
his
character
her
mind
seemed
to
absorb
his
thoughts
with
the
readiness
of
blotting
paper
and
he
did
not
pause
to
observe
whether
the
impression
had
come
out
backwards
or
forwards
he
who
had
been
so
mute
among
lady
everington
geniuses
fell
all
of
a
sudden
into
a
loquaciousness
which
was
merely
the
reaction
of
his
love
for
his
wife
the
instinct
which
makes
the
male
bird
sing
he
just
went
on
talking
and
every
day
he
became
in
his
own
estimation
and
in
that
of
asako
a
more
intelligent
a
more
original
and
a
more
eloquent
man

the

towards

they
found
their

to
the

where
they
met

at

very
indignant
or
pretending
to
be
so
at

with
which

they
were
sitting
on
the
terrace
with
the
casino
behind
them
overlooking
the
blue
mediterranean
a
few
yards
farther
on
a
tall
young
englishman
was
chatting
and
laughing
with
a
couple
of
girls
too
elaborately
beautiful
and
too
dazzlingly
gowned
for
any
world
but
the
suddenly
he
turned
and
noticed
lady
everington
with
a
courteous
farewell
to
his
companions
he
advanced
to
greet
her
aubrey
laking
she
exclaimed
you
never
answered
the
letter
i
wrote
to
you
at
tokyo
dear
lady
georgie
i
left
tokyo
ages
ago
it
followed
me
back
to
england
and
i
am
now
second
secretary
at
christiania
that
is
why
i
am
in
monte
carlo
then
let
me
introduce
you
to
asako
fujinami
who
is
now
barrington
you
must
tell
her
all
about
tokyo
it
is
her
native
city
but
she
has
not
seen
it
since
she
was
in
long
clothes
if
japanese
babies
wear
such
things
aubrey
laking
and
barrington
had
been
at
eton
together
they
were
old
friends
and
were
delighted
to
meet
once
more
barrington
especially
was
pleased
to
have
this
opportunity
to
hear
about
japan
from
one
who
had
but
lately
left
the
country
and
who
was
moreover
a
fluent
and
agreeable
talker
laking
had
not
resided
in
japan
long
enough
to
get
tired
of
orientalism
he
described
the
quaint
the
picturesque
the
amusing
side
of
life
in
the
east
he
was
full
of
enthusiasm
for
the
land
of
soft
voices
and
smiling
faces
where
countless
little
shops
spread
their
wares
under
the
light
of
the
evening
lanterns
where
the
twang
of
the
and
the
song
are
heard
coming
from
the
lighted
and
the
shadow
of
her
is
seen
appearing
and
disappearing
in
silhouette
against
the
paper
the
east
was
drawing
the
barringtons
towards
its
perilous
coasts
laking
position
at
the
tokyo
embassy
had
been
taken
by
reggie
forsyth
one
of
geoffrey
oldest
friends
his
best
man
at
his
wedding
and
a
light
of
lady
everington
circle
already
geoffrey
had
sent
him
a
saying
warm
up
the
bottle
geoffrey
was
becoming
quite
learned
in
things
japanese
and
expect
friends
shortly
however
when
the
barringtons
did
at
last
tear
themselves
from
the
riviera
they
announced
rather
disingenuously
that
they
were
going
to
egypt
they
are
too
happy
lady
everington
said
to
laking
a
few
days
later
and
they
know
nothing
i
am
afraid
there
will
be
trouble
oh
lady
georgie
he
replied
i
have
never
known
you
to
be
a
prophetess
of
gloom
i
would
have
thought
the
auspices
were
most
fortunate
they
ought
to
quarrel
more
than
they
do
lady
everington
complained
she
ought
to
contradict
him
more
than
she
does
there
must
be
a
volcanic
element
in
marriage
it
is
a
sign
of
trouble
coming
when
the
fires
are
quiet
but
they
have
got
plenty
of
money
expostulated
aubrey
whose
troubles
were
invariably
connected
with
his
banking
account
and
they
are
very
fond
of
each
other
where
is
the
trouble
to
come
from
trouble
is
on
the
lookout
for
all
of
us
aubrey
said
his
companion
it
is
no
good
flying
from
it
even
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
look
it
in
the
face
and
laugh
at
it
then
it
gets
annoyed
sometimes
and
goes
away
but
those
two
poor
dears
are
sailing
into
the
middle
of
it
and
they
do
even
know
how
to
laugh
yet
you
think
that
egypt
is
hopelessly
demoralising
thousands
of
people
go
there
and
come
safely
home
almost
all
in
fact
except
robert
hichens
heroines
oh
no
not
in
egypt
said
lady
everington
egypt
is
only
a
they
are
going
to
japan
well
certainly
japan
is
harmless
enough
there
is
nobody
there
worth
flirting
with
except
us
at
the
embassies
and
we
generally
have
our
hands
full
as
for
the
visitors
they
are
always
under
the
influence
of
cook
tickets
and
japanese
guides
aubrey
dear
you
think
that
trouble
can
only
come
from
flirting
or
money
i
know
that
those
two
preoccupations
are
an
abundant
source
of
trouble
what
do
you
think
of
mrs
barrington
asked
her
ladyship
appearing
to
change
the
subject
oh
a
very
sweet
little
thing
like
your
lady
friends
in
tokyo
the
japanese
ones
i
mean
not
in
the
least
japanese
ladies
look
very
picturesque
but
they
are
as
dull
as
dolls
they
sidle
along
in
the
wake
of
their
husbands
and
do
expect
to
be
spoken
to
and
have
you
no
more
intimate
experience
asked
lady
everington
really
aubrey
you
have
not
been
living
up
to
your
reputation
well
lady
georgie
the
young
man
proceeded
gazing
at
his
polished
boots
with
a
air
of
embarrassment
since
i
know
that
you
are
one
of
the
enlightened
ones
i
will
confess
to
you
that
i
did
keep
a
little
establishment
pierre
loti
my
japanese
teacher
thought
it
would
be
a
good
way
of
improving
my
knowledge
of
the
local
idiom
and
this
knowledge
meant
an
extra
hundred
pounds
to
me
for
interpreter
allowance
as
it
is
called
i
thought
too
that
it
would
be
a
relief
after
diplomatic
dinner
parties
to
be
able
to
swear
for
an
hour
or
so
big
round
oaths
in
the
company
of
a
dear
beloved
one
who
would
not
understand
me
so
my
teacher
undertook
to
provide
me
with
a
suitable
female
companion
he
did
in
fact
he
introduced
me
to
his
sister
and
the
suitability
was
based
on
the
fact
that
she
held
the
same
position
under
my
predecessor
a
man
whom
i
dislike
exceedingly
but
this
i
only
found
out
later
on
she
was
dull
deadly
dull
i
could
even
make
her
jealous
she
was
as
dull
as
my
japanese
grammar
and
when
i
had
passed
my
examination
and
burnt
my
books
i
dismissed
her
aubrey
what
a
very
wicked
story
no
lady
georgie
it
was
not
even
wicked
she
was
not
real
enough
to
sin
with
the
affair
had
not
even
the
excitement
of
badness
to
keep
it
going
do
you
know
the
japanese
well
lady
everington
returned
to
the
highroad
of
her
inquiry
no
nobody
does
they
are
a
most
secretive
people
do
you
think
that
if
the
barringtons
go
to
japan
there
is
any
danger
of
asako
being
drawn
back
into
the
bosom
of
her
family
no
i
should
think
so
laking
replied
japanese
life
is
so
very
uncomfortable
you
know
even
to
the
japs
themselves
when
once
they
have
got
used
to
living
in
europe
or
america
they
sleep
on
the
floor
their
clothes
are
inconvenient
and
their
food
is
nasty
even
in
the
houses
of
the
rich
ones
yes
it
must
be
a
peculiar
country
what
do
you
think
is
the
greatest
shock
for
the
average
traveller
who
goes
there
lady
georgie
you
are
asking
me
very
searching
questions
i
do
think
i
will
answer
any
more
just
this
one
she
pleaded
he
considered
his
boots
again
for
a
moment
and
then
raising
his
face
to
hers
with
that
humorous
challenging
look
which
he
assumes
when
on
the
verge
of
some
indiscretion
he
replied
the
yes
said
her
ladyship
i
have
heard
of
such
a
place
it
is
a
kind
of
vanity
fair
is
it
for
all
the
of
tokyo
it
more
than
that
laking
answered
it
is
a
market
of
human
flesh
with
nothing
to
disguise
the
crude
fact
except
the
picturesqueness
of
the
place
it
is
a
square
enclosure
as
large
as
a
small
town
in
this
enclosure
are
shops
and
in
the
shop
windows
women
are
displayed
just
like
goods
or
like
animals
in
cages
for
the
windows
have
wooden
bars
some
of
the
girls
sit
there
stolidly
like
stuffed
images
some
of
them
come
to
the
bars
and
try
to
catch
hold
of
the
just
like
monkeys
and
joke
with
them
and
shout
after
them
but
i
could
not
understand
what
they
said
fortunately
perhaps
the
girls
there
must
be
several
thousands
are
all
dressed
up
in
bright
kimonos
it
really
is
a
very
pretty
sight
until
one
begins
to
think
they
have
their
price
tickets
hung
up
in
the
shop
windows
one
shilling
up
to
one
pound
that
is
the
greatest
shock
which
japan
has
in
store
for
the
ordinary
tourist
lady
everington
was
silent
for
a
moment
her
flippant
companion
had
become
quite
serious
after
all
she
said
is
it
any
worse
than
piccadilly
circus
at
night
it
is
not
a
question
of
better
or
worse
argued
laking
such
a
purely
mercenary
system
is
a
terrible
offence
to
our
most
cherished
belief
we
may
be
hypocrites
but
our
hypocrisy
itself
is
an
admission
of
guilt
and
an
act
of
worship
to
us
even
to
the
readiest
sinners
among
us
woman
is
always
something
divine
the
lowest
assignation
of
the
streets
has
at
least
a
disguise
of
romance
it
symbolises
the
words
and
the
ways
of
love
even
if
it
parodies
them
but
to
the
japanese
woman
must
be
merely
animal
you
buy
a
girl
as
you
buy
a
cow
lady
everington
shivered
but
she
tried
to
live
up
to
her
reputation
of
being
shocked
by
nothing
well
that
is
true
after
all
whether
in
piccadilly
or
in
the
yoshiwara
all
prostitution
is
just
a
commercial
transaction
perhaps
said
the
young
diplomat
but
what
about
the
ideal
at
the
back
of
our
minds
passion
is
often
a
grotesque
incarnation
of
the
ideal
like
a
savage
rude
image
of
his
god
a
glimpse
of
the
ideal
is
possible
in
piccadilly
and
impossible
in
the
yoshiwara
the
divine
something
was
visible
in
marguérite
gautier
little
hugh
saw
it
even
in
nana
for
one
thing
here
in
london
in
the
dirtiest
of
sordid
dramas
it
is
still
the
woman
who
gives
but
in
japan
it
is
always
the
man
who
takes
aubrey
said
his
friend
i
had
no
idea
that
you
were
a
poet
or
in
other
words
that
you
ever
talked
nonsense
without
laughing
you
think
such
a
shock
is
strong
enough
to
upset
the
barrington
it
will
give
furiously
to
think
he
answered
to
poor
old
geoffrey
who
is
a
very
straight
clean
and
honest
fellow
not
overused
to
furious
thinking
i
suppose
if
one
married
a
monkey
one
might
persuade
oneself
of
her
humanity
until
one
saw
her
kindred
in
cages
poor
little
asako
my
latest
cried
lady
everington
really
aubrey
you
are
very
rude
i
did
not
mean
to
be
said
laking
penitently
she
is
a
most
ingratiating
little
creature
like
a
lazy
kitten
but
i
think
it
is
unwise
for
him
to
take
her
to
japan
all
kinds
of
latent
orientalisms
may
develop
the
spring
was
at
hand
the
season
of
impulse
when
we
obey
most
readily
the
sudden
stirrings
of
our
hearts
even
in
the
torrid
climate
of
egypt
squalls
of
rain
passed
over
like
stray
birds
of
passage
asako
barrington
felt
the
fresh
influence
and
the
desire
to
do
new
things
in
new
places
hitherto
she
had
evinced
very
little
inclination
to
revisit
the
home
of
her
ancestors
but
on
their
return
from
the
temples
of
luxor
she
said
quite
unexpectedly
to
geoffrey
if
we
go
to
japan
now
we
shall
be
in
time
to
see
the
why
little
yum
yum
cried
her
husband
delighted
are
you
tired
of
pharaohs
egypt
is
very
interesting
said
asako
correctly
it
is
wonderful
to
think
of
these
great
places
standing
here
for
thousands
and
thousands
of
years
but
it
makes
one
sad
do
you
think
everybody
here
seems
to
have
died
long
long
ago
it
would
be
nice
to
see
green
fields
again
would
it
geoffrey
dearest
the
voice
of
the
spring
was
speaking
clearly
and
you
really
want
to
go
to
japan
sweetheart
it
the
first
time
i
heard
you
say
you
want
to
go
uncle
and
aunt
murata
in
paris
used
always
to
say
about
now
we
go
back
to
japan
we
shall
be
in
time
to
see
the
why
asked
geoffrey
do
the
japanese
make
such
a
fuss
about
their
they
must
be
very
pretty
answered
his
wife
like
great
clouds
of
snow
besides
the
are
supposed
to
be
like
the
japanese
spirit
so
you
are
my
little
is
that
right
oh
no
not
the
women
she
replied
the
men
are
the
geoffrey
laughed
it
seemed
absurd
to
him
to
compare
a
man
to
the
frail
and
transient
beauty
of
a
flower
then
what
about
the
japanese
ladies
he
asked
if
the
men
are
blossoms
asako
did
not
think
they
had
any
special
flower
to
symbolise
their
charms
she
suggested
the
bamboo
they
say
because
the
wives
have
to
bend
under
the
storms
when
their
husbands
are
angry
but
geoffrey
you
are
never
angry
you
do
not
give
me
a
chance
to
be
like
the
bamboo
next
day
he
boldly
booked
their
tickets
for
tokyo
the
long
sea
voyage
was
a
pleasant
experience
broken
by
fleeting
visits
to
startled
friends
in
ceylon
and
at
singapore
and
enlivened
by
the
close
ephemeral
intimacies
of
life
on
board
ship
there
was
a
motley
company
on
board
a
company
whose
most
obvious
elements
the
noisy
and
bibulous
pests
in
the
and
the
ladies
of
mysterious
destination
with
whom
they
dallied
were
dismissed
by
geoffrey
at
once
as
being
terrible
bounders
beneath
this
scum
more
congenial
spirits
came
to
light
officers
and
government
officials
returning
to
their
posts
and
a
few
of
leisure
everybody
seemed
anxious
to
pay
attention
to
the
charming
japanese
lady
and
from
such
incessant
attention
it
is
difficult
to
escape
within
the
narrow
bounds
of
ship
life
the
only
way
to
keep
off
the
impossibles
was
to
form
a
bodyguard
of
the
possibles
the
seclusion
of
the
honeymoon
paradise
had
to
be
opened
up
for
once
in
a
way
of
course
there
was
much
talk
about
the
east
but
it
was
a
different
point
of
view
from
that
of
the
enthusiasts
of
deauville
and
the
riviera
these
men
and
women
had
many
of
them
lived
in
india
the
malay
states
japan
or
the
open
ports
of
china
lived
there
to
earn
their
bread
and
butter
not
to
dream
about
the
magic
of
the
orient
for
such
as
these
the
romance
had
faded
the
pages
of
their
busy
lives
were
written
within
a
mourning
border
of
discontent
of
longing
for
that
home
land
to
which
on
the
occasion
of
their
rare
holidays
they
returned
so
readily
and
which
seemed
to
have
no
particular
place
or
use
for
them
when
they
did
return
they
were
members
of
the
british
dispersion
but
their
zion
was
of
more
comfort
to
them
as
a
sweet
memory
than
as
an
actual
home
yes
they
would
say
about
the
land
of
their
exile
it
is
very
picturesque
but
their
faces
lined
or
pale
their
bitterness
and
their
reticence
told
of
years
of
strain
laboriously
in
lands
where
relaxations
are
few
and
forced
where
climatic
conditions
are
adverse
where
fevers
lurk
and
where
the
white
minority
are
posted
like
soldiers
in
a
lonely
fort
ever
suspicious
ever
on
the
watch
the
most
faithful
of
asako
bodyguard
was
a
countryman
of
her
own
viscount
kamimura
the
son
of
a
celebrated
japanese
statesman
and
diplomat
who
after
completing
his
course
at
cambridge
was
returning
to
his
own
country
for
the
first
time
after
many
years
he
was
a
shy
gentle
youth
very
quiet
and
refined
a
little
effeminate
even
in
his
exaggerated
gracefulness
and
in
his
meticulous
care
for
his
clothes
and
his
person
he
avoided
all
company
except
that
of
the
barringtons
probably
because
a
similarity
in
circumstances
formed
a
bond
between
him
and
his
he
had
a
high
intellectual
forehead
the
beautiful
deep
brown
eyes
of
asako
curling
sarcastic
lips
a
nose
almost
aquiline
but
starting
a
fraction
of
an
inch
too
low
between
his
eyes
he
had
read
everything
he
remembered
everything
and
he
had
played
lawn
tennis
for
his
university
he
was
returning
to
japan
to
be
married
when
geoffrey
asked
him
who
his
fiancée
was
he
replied
that
he
did
not
know
yet
but
that
his
relatives
would
tell
him
as
soon
as
ever
he
arrived
in
japan
have
you
got
any
say
in
the
matter
asked
the
englishman
oh
yes
he
answered
if
i
actually
dislike
her
i
need
not
marry
her
but
of
course
the
choice
is
limited
so
i
must
try
not
to
be
too
hard
to
please
geoffrey
thought
that
it
must
be
because
of
his
extreme
aristocracy
that
so
few
maidens
in
japan
were
worthy
of
his
hand
but
asako
asked
the
question
why
is
the
choice
so
small
you
see
he
said
there
are
not
many
girls
in
japan
who
can
speak
both
english
and
french
and
as
i
am
going
into
the
diplomatic
service
and
shall
leave
japan
again
shortly
that
is
an
absolute
necessity
besides
she
must
have
a
very
good
degree
from
her
school
geoffrey
could
hardly
restrain
himself
from
laughing
this
idea
of
choosing
a
wife
like
a
governess
for
her
linguistic
accomplishments
seemed
to
him
exceedingly
comic
you
do
mind
trusting
other
people
he
said
to
arrange
your
marriage
for
you
certainly
not
said
the
young
japanese
they
are
my
own
relatives
and
they
will
do
their
best
for
me
they
are
all
older
than
i
am
and
they
have
had
the
experience
of
their
own
marriages
but
said
geoffrey
when
you
saw
your
friends
in
england
choosing
for
themselves
and
falling
in
love
and
marrying
for
love
sake
some
of
them
chose
for
themselves
and
married
barmaids
and
divorced
persons
just
for
the
reason
that
they
were
in
love
and
uncontrolled
so
they
brought
shame
on
their
families
and
are
probably
now
very
unhappy
i
think
they
would
have
done
better
if
they
had
let
their
relatives
choose
for
them
yes
but
the
others
who
marry
girls
of
their
own
set
i
think
their
choice
is
not
really
free
at
all
i
do
not
think
it
is
so
much
the
girl
who
attracts
them
it
is
the
plans
and
intentions
of
those
around
them
which
urge
them
on
it
is
a
kind
of
mesmerism
the
parents
of
the
young
man
and
the
parents
of
the
young
girl
make
the
marriage
by
force
of
will
that
also
is
a
good
way
it
is
not
so
very
different
from
our
system
in
japan
do
you
think
that
people
in
england
marry
because
they
love
each
other
asked
asako
perhaps
so
replied
kamimura
but
in
our
japanese
language
we
have
no
word
which
is
quite
the
same
as
your
word
love
so
they
say
we
do
not
know
what
this
love
is
it
may
be
so
perhaps
anyhow
barrington
will
not
wish
to
learn
japanese
i
think
geoffrey
liked
the
young
man
he
was
a
good
athlete
he
was
unassuming
and
he
clearly
knew
the
difference
between
good
and
bad
form
geoffrey
chief
misgiving
with
regard
to
japan
had
been
a
doubt
as
to
the
wisdom
of
making
the
acquaintance
of
his
wife
kindred
how
dreadful
if
they
turned
out
to
be
a
collection
of
oriental
curios
with
whom
he
would
not
have
one
idea
in
common
the
company
of
this
young
aristocrat
in
no
way
distinguishable
from
an
englishman
except
for
a
certain
grace
and
maturity
reassured
him
no
doubt
his
wife
would
have
cousins
like
this
clean
manly
fellows
who
would
take
him
shooting
and
with
whom
he
could
enjoy
a
game
of
golf
he
thought
that
kamimura
must
be
typical
of
the
young
japanese
of
the
upper
classes
he
did
not
realize
that
he
was
an
official
product
chosen
by
his
government
and
carefully
moulded
and
polished
not
to
be
a
japanese
at
home
but
to
be
a
japanese
abroad
the
qualified
representative
of
a
first
class
power
kamimura
left
the
boat
with
them
at
colombo
and
joined
them
in
their
visit
to
some
relatives
he
was
ready
to
do
the
same
at
singapore
but
he
received
an
urgent
cable
from
japan
recalling
him
at
once
i
must
not
be
too
late
for
my
own
wedding
he
said
during
their
last
lunch
together
at
raffles
hotel
it
would
be
a
terrible
sin
against
the
laws
of
filial
piety
whatever
is
that
asked
asako
dear
barrington
are
you
a
daughter
of
japan
and
have
never
heard
of
the
children
no
who
are
they
they
are
model
children
the
paragons
of
goodness
celebrated
because
of
their
love
for
their
fathers
and
mothers
one
of
them
walked
miles
and
miles
every
day
to
get
water
from
a
certain
spring
for
his
sick
mother
another
when
a
tiger
was
going
to
eat
his
father
rushed
to
the
animal
and
cried
eat
me
instead
little
boys
and
girls
in
japan
are
always
being
told
to
be
like
the
children
oh
how
i
hate
them
cried
asako
that
is
because
you
are
a
rebellious
individualistic
englishwoman
you
have
lost
that
sense
of
family
union
which
makes
good
japanese
brothers
and
cousins
and
uncles
and
aunts
all
love
each
other
publicly
however
much
they
may
hate
each
other
in
private
that
is
very
hypocritical
it
is
the
social
law
replied
kamimura
in
japan
the
family
is
the
important
thing
you
and
i
are
nothing
if
you
want
to
get
on
in
the
world
you
must
always
be
subject
to
your
family
then
you
are
sure
to
get
on
however
stupid
you
may
be
in
england
you
seem
to
use
your
families
chiefly
to
quarrel
with
i
think
our
relatives
ought
to
be
just
our
best
friends
said
asako
they
are
that
too
in
a
way
the
young
man
answered
in
japan
it
would
be
better
to
be
born
without
hands
and
feet
than
to
be
born
without
relatives
chapter
iv
nagasaki
to
akashi
no
ura
no
ni
fune
wo
shi
zo
my
thoughts
are
with
a
boat
which
travels
in
the
of
the
shore
of
akashi
dim
dim
after
hongkong
they
let
the
zone
of
eternal
summer
behind
them
the
crossing
from
shanghai
to
japan
was
rough
and
the
wind
bitter
but
on
the
first
morning
in
japanese
waters
geoffrey
was
on
deck
betimes
to
enjoy
to
the
full
the
excitement
of
arrival
they
were
approaching
nagasaki
it
was
a
misty
dawn
the
sky
was
like
and
the
sea
like
mica
abrupt
grey
islands
appeared
and
disappeared
phantasmal
like
guardian
spirits
of
japan
representatives
of
those
myriads
of
shinto
deities
who
have
the
empire
in
their
keeping
then
suddenly
from
behind
the
cliff
of
one
of
the
islands
a
fishing
boat
came
gliding
with
the
silent
stateliness
of
a
swan
the
body
of
the
boat
was
low
and
slender
built
of
some
white
shining
wood
from
the
middle
rose
the
high
sail
like
a
silver
tower
it
looked
like
the
soul
of
that
sleeping
island
setting
out
upon
a
dream
journey
the
mist
was
dissolving
slowly
revealing
more
islands
and
more
boats
some
of
them
passed
quite
close
to
the
steamer
and
geoffrey
could
see
the
fishermen
dwarfish
figures
straining
at
the
oar
or
squatting
at
the
bottom
of
the
boat
looking
like
nibelungen
on
the
quest
for
the
rhinegold
he
could
hear
their
strange
cries
to
each
other
and
to
the
steamer
harsh
like
the
voice
of
asako
came
on
deck
to
join
her
husband
the
thrill
of
returning
to
japan
had
scattered
her
partiality
for
late
sleeping
she
was
dressed
in
a
coat
and
skirt
of
serge
her
shoulders
were
wrapped
in
a
broad
stole
of
sable
her
head
was
bare
perhaps
it
was
the
inherited
instinct
of
generations
of
japanese
women
who
never
cover
their
heads
which
made
her
dislike
hats
and
avoid
wearing
them
if
possible
the
sun
was
still
covered
but
the
view
was
clear
as
far
as
the
high
mountains
on
the
horizon
towards
which
the
ship
was
ploughing
her
way
look
asako
japan
she
was
not
looking
at
the
distance
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
an
emerald
islet
half
a
mile
or
less
from
the
steamer
course
a
jewel
of
the
seas
it
rose
to
the
height
of
two
hundred
feet
or
so
a
conical
knoll
densely
wooded
on
the
summit
appeared
a
scar
of
rock
like
a
ruined
castle
and
rising
from
the
rock
crest
a
single
its
trunk
was
twisted
by
all
the
winds
of
heaven
its
long
lean
branches
groped
the
air
like
the
arms
of
a
blinded
demon
it
seemed
to
have
an
almost
human
personality
an
expression
of
fruitless
striving
pathetic
yet
somehow
sinister
a
prometheus
among
trees
geoffrey
followed
his
wife
gaze
to
the
base
of
the
island
where
a
shoal
of
brown
rocks
trailed
out
to
seawards
in
a
miniature
bay
he
saw
a
tiny
beach
of
golden
sand
and
planted
in
the
sand
a
red
gateway
two
uprights
and
two
lintels
the
lower
one
held
between
the
posts
the
upper
one
laid
across
them
and
protruding
on
either
side
it
is
the
simplest
of
architectural
designs
but
strangely
suggestive
it
transformed
that
wooded
island
into
a
it
cast
an
enchantment
over
it
and
seemed
to
explain
the
meaning
of
the
the
place
was
holy
an
abode
of
spirits
geoffrey
had
read
enough
by
now
to
recognize
the
gateway
as
a
a
religious
symbol
in
japan
which
always
announces
the
neighbourhood
of
a
shrine
it
is
a
common
feature
of
the
as
familiar
as
the
crucifix
in
catholic
lands
but
asako
seeing
the
beauty
of
her
country
for
the
first
time
and
unaware
of
the
dimming
cloud
of
archaeological
explanations
clapped
her
hands
together
three
times
in
sheer
delight
or
was
it
in
unconscious
obedience
to
the
custom
of
her
race
which
in
this
way
calls
upon
its
gods
then
with
a
movement
entirely
occidental
she
threw
her
arms
round
her
husband
neck
kissing
him
with
all
the
devotion
of
her
being
dear
old
geoffrey
i
love
you
so
she
murmured
her
brown
eyes
were
full
of
tears
the
steamer
passed
into
a
narrow
channel
a
kind
of
fiord
with
wooded
hills
on
both
sides
the
forests
were
green
with
spring
foliage
never
had
geoffrey
seen
such
a
variety
or
such
density
of
verdure
every
tree
seemed
to
be
different
from
its
neighbour
and
the
hillsides
were
packed
with
trees
like
a
crowded
audience
here
and
there
a
spray
of
mountain
rose
among
the
green
like
a
jet
of
snow
at
the
foot
of
the
woods
by
the
edge
of
the
calm
water
the
villages
nestled
only
roofs
could
be
seen
high
brown
thatched
roofs
with
a
line
of
irises
growing
along
the
like
a
crown
these
native
cottages
looked
like
timid
animals
cowering
in
their
forms
under
the
protecting
trees
one
felt
that
at
any
time
an
indiscreet
hoot
of
the
steamer
might
send
them
scuttering
back
to
the
forest
depths
there
were
no
signs
of
life
in
these
submerged
villages
where
the
fight
between
the
forester
axe
and
primal
vegetation
seemed
still
undecided
life
was
there
but
it
was
hidden
under
the
luxuriance
of
the
overgrowth
hidden
to
casual
like
the
life
of
insects
only
by
the
seaside
where
the
houses
were
clustered
together
above
a
seawall
of
cyclopean
stones
and
on
the
beach
where
the
long
narrow
boats
and
piratical
were
drawn
up
to
the
shore
the
same
little
men
with
a
generous
display
of
naked
brown
limbs
were
sawing
and
hammering
and
mending
their
nets
the
steamer
glided
up
the
fiord
towards
a
cloud
of
black
smoke
ahead
unknown
to
geoffrey
it
passed
the
grey
italianate
catholic
cathedral
the
shrine
of
the
old
christian
faith
of
japan
planted
there
by
saint
francis
xavier
four
hundred
years
ago
anchor
was
cast
off
the
island
of
deshima
now
moored
to
the
mainland
where
during
the
locked
centuries
the
dutch
merchants
had
been
permitted
to
remain
in
profitable
servitude
deshima
has
now
been
swallowed
up
by
the
japanese
town
and
its
significance
has
shifted
across
the
bay
to
where
the
smoke
and
din
of
the
mitsubishi
dockyard
prepare
romantic
visitors
for
the
modern
industrial
life
of
the
new
japan
night
and
day
the
furnace
fires
are
roaring
and
ten
thousand
workmen
are
busy
building
ships
of
war
and
ships
of
peace
for
the
britain
of
the
pacific
the
quarantine
officers
came
on
board
little
brown
men
in
uniform
absurdly
then
the
ship
was
besieged
by
a
swarm
of
those
narrow
primitive
boats
called
which
loti
has
described
as
a
kind
of
barbaric
gondola
all
jostling
each
other
to
bring
merchants
of
local
wares
damascene
pottery
and
picture
post
cards
aboard
the
vessel
and
to
take
visitors
ashore
geoffrey
and
asako
were
among
the
first
to
land
the
moment
of
arrival
on
japanese
soil
brought
a
pang
of
disappointment
the
at
nagasaki
seemed
very
like
a
street
in
any
starveling
european
town
it
presented
a
line
of
offices
and
consulates
built
in
western
style
without
distinction
and
without
charm
customs
officers
and
policemen
squinted
suspiciously
at
the
strangers
a
few
women
in
charge
of
children
or
stared
blankly
why
they
are
wearing
kimonos
exclaimed
asako
but
how
dirty
and
dusty
they
are
they
look
as
though
they
had
been
sleeping
in
them
the
japanese
women
indeed
cling
to
their
national
dress
but
to
the
barringtons
landing
at
nagasaki
they
seemed
ugly
shapeless
and
dingy
their
hair
was
greasy
and
unkempt
their
faces
were
stupid
and
staring
their
figures
were
hidden
in
the
muffle
of
their
dirty
garments
geoffrey
had
been
told
they
have
baths
at
least
once
a
day
but
he
was
inclined
to
doubt
it
or
else
it
was
because
they
all
bathed
in
the
same
bath
and
their
ablutions
were
merely
an
exchange
of
grime
but
where
were
those
butterfly
girls
who
dance
with
fan
and
battledore
on
our
cups
and
saucers
the
rickshaws
were
a
pleasant
experience
the
perambulators
and
the
costume
of
the
was
delightful
and
their
gnarled
indefatigable
legs
with
their
tight
of
a
coarse
material
and
short
coat
to
match
like
an
eton
jacket
and
with
their
large
round
mushroom
hats
they
were
like
figures
from
the
crowd
of
a
flemish
crucifixion
behind
the
barrington
a
large
lighter
came
alongside
the
wharf
it
was
black
with
and
in
one
corner
was
heaped
a
pile
of
shallow
baskets
such
as
are
used
in
coaling
vessels
at
japanese
ports
being
slipped
from
hand
to
hand
in
unbroken
chain
up
the
ship
side
and
down
again
to
the
coal
barge
the
work
was
finished
the
lighter
was
empty
except
for
a
crowd
of
coolies
which
it
was
bringing
back
to
nagasaki
these
were
dressed
like
the
they
wore
tight
trousers
short
jackets
and
straw
sandals
they
were
sitting
wearied
on
the
sides
of
the
barge
wiping
black
faces
with
black
towels
their
hair
was
long
lank
and
matted
their
hands
were
bruised
and
shapeless
with
the
rough
toil
poor
men
sighed
asako
they
had
hard
work
the
crowd
of
them
passed
peering
at
the
english
people
and
chattering
in
high
voices
geoffrey
had
never
seen
such
fellows
with
their
long
hair
faces
and
stumpy
one
more
disheveled
than
the
others
was
standing
near
him
with
tunic
it
exposed
a
woman
breast
black
loose
and
hard
like
leather
they
are
women
he
exclaimed
what
an
extraordinary
thing
but
the
children
of
nagasaki
surely
there
could
be
no
such
disillusionment
they
are
laughing
happy
and
ubiquitous
they
roll
under
the
rickshaw
wheels
they
peep
from
behind
the
goods
piled
on
the
floors
of
the
shops
a
perpetual
menace
to
shopkeepers
especially
in
the
china
stores
where
their
presence
is
more
dangerous
than
that
of
the
dreaded
bull
they
are
blown
up
and
down
the
like
fallen
petals
they
gather
like
round
the
itinerant
venders
of
the
streets
the
old
men
who
balance
on
their
bare
shoulders
their
whole
stock
in
trade
of
sweetmeats
syrups
toys
or
singing
grasshoppers
they
are
the
dolls
of
our
own
childhood
endowed
with
disconcerting
life
around
their
little
bodies
flames
the
love
of
colour
of
an
oriental
people
whose
adult
taste
has
been
disciplined
to
sombre
browns
and
greys
wonderful
motley
kimonos
they
make
for
their
children
with
flower
patterns
butterfly
patterns
toy
and
patterns
printed
on
flannelette
or
on
silk
for
the
little
plutocrats
in
all
colors
among
which
reds
oranges
yellows
mauves
blues
and
greens
predominate
they
invaded
the
depressing
atmosphere
of
the
hotel
where
geoffrey
and
asako
were
trying
to
enjoy
a
tasteless
lunch
their
grubby
bare
feet
pattering
on
the
worn
lino
it
pleased
him
to
watch
them
playing
their
game
of
with
much
show
of
pudgy
fingers
and
with
restrained
and
fitful
scamperings
he
even
made
a
tentative
bid
for
popularity
by
throwing
copper
coins
there
was
no
scramble
for
this
largesse
gravely
and
in
turn
each
child
pocketed
his
penny
but
they
all
regarded
geoffrey
with
a
wary
and
suspicious
eye
he
too
on
closer
inspection
found
them
less
angelic
than
at
first
sight
the
slimy
horror
of
unwiped
noses
distressed
him
and
the
significant
prevalence
of
scabby
scalps
after
their
dull
lunch
in
this
drab
hotel
geoffrey
and
his
wife
started
once
more
on
their
voyage
of
discovery
nagasaki
is
a
hidden
city
it
flows
through
its
narrow
valleys
like
water
and
follows
their
serpentine
meanderings
far
inland
they
soon
left
behind
the
foreign
settlement
and
its
nondescript
ugliness
to
plunge
into
the
labyrinth
of
little
native
streets
wayward
and
wandering
like
with
sudden
abrupt
hills
and
flights
of
steps
which
checked
the
rickshaws
progress
here
the
houses
of
the
rich
people
were
closely
fenced
and
cunningly
hidden
but
the
life
of
poverty
and
the
shopkeepers
domesticity
were
flowing
over
into
the
street
out
of
the
too
narrow
confines
of
the
boxes
which
they
called
their
homes
with
an
extra
man
to
push
behind
the
rickshaws
had
brought
them
up
a
zigzag
hill
to
a
cautious
wooden
gateway
half
open
in
a
close
fence
of
bamboo
said
the
rickshaw
man
stopping
and
grinning
it
was
clearly
expected
of
the
foreigners
that
they
should
descend
and
enter
shall
we
get
out
and
explore
sweetheart
suggested
geoffrey
they
passed
under
the
low
gate
up
a
pebbled
pathway
through
the
sweetest
fairy
garden
to
the
entrance
of
the
a
stage
of
brown
boards
highly
polished
and
never
defiled
by
the
contamination
of
muddy
boots
on
the
steps
of
approach
a
collection
of
native
wooden
clogs
and
abominable
shoes
told
that
guests
had
already
arrived
within
the
dark
corridors
of
the
house
there
was
an
immediate
fluttering
as
of
pigeons
four
or
five
little
women
prostrated
themselves
before
the
visitors
with
a
hissing
murmur
of
condescend
to
come
the
barringtons
removed
their
boots
and
followed
one
of
these
ladies
down
a
gleaming
corridor
with
another
miniature
garden
in
an
enclosed
courtyard
on
one
side
and
paper
and
peeping
faces
on
the
other
out
across
a
further
garden
by
a
kind
of
oriental
bridge
of
sighs
to
a
small
separate
pavilion
which
floated
on
a
lake
of
green
shrubs
and
pure
air
as
though
moored
by
the
wooden
gangway
to
the
main
block
of
the
building
this
contained
a
single
small
room
like
a
very
clean
box
with
wooden
frame
opaque
paper
walls
and
pale
golden
matting
the
only
wall
which
seemed
at
all
substantial
presented
the
appearance
of
an
alcove
in
this
niche
there
hung
a
long
picture
of
on
a
mountain
side
below
which
on
a
stand
of
dark
sandalwood
squatted
a
bronze
monkey
holding
a
crystal
ball
this
was
the
only
ornament
in
the
room
geoffrey
and
his
wife
sat
down
or
sprawled
on
square
silk
cushions
called
then
the
were
thrown
open
and
they
looked
down
upon
nagasaki
it
was
a
scene
of
sheer
enchantment
the
was
perched
on
a
cliff
which
overhung
the
city
the
light
pavilion
seemed
like
the
car
of
some
pullman
aeroplane
hovering
over
the
bay
it
was
the
brief
of
evening
the
time
of
day
when
the
magic
of
japan
is
at
its
most
powerful
all
that
was
cheap
and
sordid
was
shut
out
by
the
bamboo
fence
and
wrapped
away
in
the
twilight
mists
it
was
a
of
luminous
greyness
the
skies
were
grey
and
the
waters
of
the
bay
and
the
roofs
of
the
houses
a
grey
vapour
rose
from
the
town
and
a
trail
of
smoke
drifted
from
the
dockyards
and
from
the
steamers
in
the
harbour
the
cries
and
activities
of
the
city
below
rose
clear
and
distinct
but
infinitely
remote
as
sound
of
the
world
might
reach
the
gods
in
heaven
it
was
a
of
fairyland
when
anything
might
happen
two
little
maids
brought
tea
and
sugary
cakes
green
tea
like
bitter
hot
water
insipid
and
unsatisfying
it
was
a
shock
to
see
the
faces
as
they
raised
the
tiny
china
teacups
under
the
glaze
of
their
powder
they
were
old
and
wise
they
observed
asako
nationality
and
began
to
speak
to
her
in
japanese
their
politeness
is
put
on
to
order
thought
geoffrey
they
seem
forward
and
inquisitive
minxes
but
asako
only
knew
a
few
set
phrases
of
her
native
tongue
this
baffled
the
ladies
one
of
whom
after
a
whispered
consultation
and
some
giggling
behind
sleeves
went
off
to
find
a
friend
who
would
solve
the
mystery
elder
sister
she
called
across
the
garden
strange
little
dishes
were
produced
on
trays
of
red
lacquer
fish
and
vegetables
of
different
kinds
artistically
arranged
but
most
unpalatable
a
third
appeared
she
could
speak
some
english
is
lady
japanese
she
began
after
she
had
placed
the
tiny
square
table
before
geoffrey
and
had
performed
a
prostration
geoffrey
assented
renewed
prostration
before
and
murmured
greetings
in
japanese
but
i
ca

japanese
said
asako
laughing
this
perplexed
the
girl
but
her
curiosity
prompted
her
master
ingiris
she
asked

geoffrey

asako

lapsed
into
vernacular
the
other
girl
showed
with
feigned
embarrassment
a
little
ring
set
with
glassy
sapphires

asako
dimly

she
feel
very
sick
heart
very
lonely
very
sad
a
weird
unpleasant
feeling
had
stolen
into
the
little
room
the
presence
of
unfamiliar
thoughts
and
of
foreign
moralities
birds
of
unhealth
the
two
other
girls
who
could
not
speak
english
were
posing
for
geoffrey
benefit
one
of
them
reclining
against
the
framework
of
the
open
window
with
her
long
kimono
sleeves
crossed
in
front
of
her
like
wings
her
painted
oval
face
fixed
on
him
in
spite
of
the
semblance
of
downcast
eyes
the
other
squatting
on
her
heels
in
a
corner
of
the
room
with
the
same
demure
expression
and
with
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
despite
the
quietness
of
the
poses
they
were
as
challenging
in
their
way
as
the
swinging
hips
of
piccadilly
it
is
as
true
as
it
was
in
kaempffer
time
the
old
dutch
traveler
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
that
every
hotel
in
japan
is
a
brothel
and
every
and
restaurant
a
house
of
assignation
from
a
wing
of
the
building
near
by
came
the
twanging
of
a
string
like
a
banjo
string
being
tuned
in
fantastic
quarter
tones
a
few
sharp
notes
were
struck
at
random
it
seemed
followed
by
a
few
bars
of
a
quavering
song
and
then
a
burst
of
clownish
laughter
young
bloods
of
nagasaki
had
called
in
to
amuse
them
at
their
meal
japanese
said
the
girl
if
wish
to

thank

said
geoffrey
hurriedly
asako

went

to
sit
silent
and
look
wise
is
not
to
be
compared
with
drinking
and
making
a
riotous
shouting
as
soon
as
the
meal
was
over
asako
went
to
bed
she
was
tired
out
by
an
orgy
of
and
new
impressions
geoffrey
said
that
he
would
have
a
short
walk
and
a
smoke
before
turning
in
he
took
the
road
which
led
towards
the
harbour
of
nagasaki
chonkina
chon
chon

kina
yokohama
nagasaki
hakodate
hoi
the
refrain
of
an
old
song
was
awakened
in
his
mind
by
the
melodious
name
of
the
place
he
descended
the
hill
from
the
hotel
and
crossed
a
bridge
over
a
narrow
river
the
town
was
full
of
beauty
the
warm
light
in
the
little
wooden
houses
the
creamy
light
of
the
paper
walls
illuminated
from
within
with
the
black
silhouettes
of
the
home
groups
traced
upon
them
the
lanterns
dancing
on
the
boats
in
the
harbour
the
lights
on
the
larger
vessels
in
stiff
patterns
like
propositions
of
euclid
the
lanterns
on
carts
and
rickshaws
lanterns
like
fruit
red
golden
and
glowing
and
round
bubble
lamps
over
each
house
entrance
with
chinese
characters
written
upon
them
giving
the
name
of
the
occupant
chonkina
as
though
in
answer
to
his
incantation
geoffrey
suddenly
came
upon
wigram
wigram
had
been
a
on
board
the
steamer
he
was
an
old
etonian
and
this
was
really
the
only
bond
between
the
two
men
for
wigram
was
short
fat
and
flabby
and
he
spoke
with
a
drawl
he
had
literary
pretensions
and
he
was
travelling
for
pleasure
hello
barrington
he
said
you
all
alone
yes
answered
geoffrey
my
wife
is
a
bit
overtired
she
has
turned
in
so
you
are
making
the
most
of
your
opportunity
studying
eh
naughty
boy
not
much
about
is
there
said
geoffrey
who
considered
that
a
pi
fellow
was
bad
form
and
would
not
be
regarded
as
such
even
by
a
creature
whose
point
of
view
was
as
contemptible
as
that
of
wigram
does
walk
the
streets
old
man
but
it
there
all
the
same
the
men
at
the
club
here
tell
me
that
nagasaki
is
one
of
the
hottest
spots
on
the
face
of
the
globe
seems
sleepy
enough
answered
geoffrey
oh
here
these
are
just
english
warehouses
and
consulates
they
always
asleep
but
you
come
with
me
and
see
them
dance
the
geoffrey
started
at
this
echo
of
his
own
thoughts
but
he
said
i
must
be
getting
back
my
wife
will
be
anxious
not
yet
not
yet
it
will
be
all
over
in
half
an
hour
and
it
worth
seeing
i
am
just
going
to
the
club
to
find
a
fellow
who
said
show
me
the
ropes
geoffrey
allowed
himself
to
be
persuaded
after
all
he
was
not
expected
home
so
immediately
it
was
many
years
since
he
had
visited
low
and
disreputable
places
they
were
bad
form
and
had
no
appeal
for
him
but
the
strangeness
of
the
place
attracted
him
and
a
longing
for
the
first
glimpse
behind
the
scenes
in
this
inexplicable
new
country
chonkina
why
should
he
go
he
was
introduced
to
wigram
friend
patterson
a
scotch
merchant
of
nagasaki
who
lurched
out
of
the
club
in
his
habitual
saturday
evening
state
of
mellow
inebriation
they
called
for
three
rickshaws
whose
runners
seemed
to
know
without
instructions
whither
they
had
to
go
is
it
far
from
here
asked
geoffrey
it
is
not
so
far
said
the
scotchman
it
is
most
conveniently
situated
noiselessly
they
sped
down
narrow
twisting
streets
with
the
same
unfamiliar
lights
and
shadows
the
glowing
paper
walls
and
the
luminous
globes
of
the
gate
lamps
from
the
distance
came
the
beat
of
a
drum
geoffrey
had
heard
a
drum
sounded
like
that
before
in
the
somali
village
at
aden
a
savage
primitive
sound
with
a
kind
of
marching
rhythm
suggestive
of
the
swing
of
hundreds
of
black
bodies
moving
to
some
obscene
festival
but
here
in
japan
such
music
sounded
remote
from
the
civilisation
of
the
country
from
the
old
as
from
the
new
it
seemed
to
be
beating
the
rickshaws
turned
into
a
broader
street
with
houses
taller
and
more
commanding
than
any
seen
hitherto
they
were
built
of
brown
wood
like
big
swiss
chalets
and
were
hung
with
red
paper
lanterns
like
huge
ripe
cherries
another
entrance
more
fluttering
of
women
and
low
prostrations
a
procession
along
shining
corridors
and
up
steep
stairways
like
everywhere
a
heavy
smell
of
cheap
scent
and
powder
the
reek
of
the
brothel
the
three
guests
were
installed
squatting
or
lounging
around
a
low
table
with
beer
and
cakes
there
was
a
chorus
of
tittering
and
squeaking
voices
in
the
corridor
the
partition
slid
open
and
six
little
women
came
running
into
the
room
patasan
san
patasan

they
cried
clapping
their
hands
here
at
last
were
the
butterfly
women
of
the
traveller
imagination
they
wore
bright
kimonos
red
and
blue
embroidered
with
gold
thread
their
faces
were
pale
like
porcelain
with
the
enamelling
effect
of
the
liquid
powder
which
they
use
their
black
shiny
hair
like
liquorice
was
arranged
in
fantastic
volutes
which
were
adorned
with
silver
ornaments
and
paper
flowers
choking
down
admiration
a
cloud
of
heavy
perfume
hung
around
them
good
day
to
you
they
squeaked
in
comical
english
how
do
you
do
i
love
you
please

put
her
arm
around
geoffrey
neck
the
little
fingers
felt
like
the
touch
of
insects
and
said
my
darling
you
love
me
the
big
englishman
disengaged
himself
gently
it
is
bad
form
to
be
rough
to
women
even
to
japanese
courtesans
he
began
to
be
sorry
that
he
had
come
i
have
brought
two
very
dear
friends
of
mine
said
patterson
to
all
the
world
for
pleasure
artistic
rather
than
carnal
though
perhaps
i
can
safely
prophesy
that
the
pleasure
of
the
senses
is
the
end
of
all
true
art
we
have
come
to
see
the
national
dance
of
japan
the
nagasaki
reel
the
famous
i
myself
am
familiar
with
the
dance
on
two
or
three
occasions
i
have
performed
with
credit
in
these
very
halls
but
these
two
gentlemen
have
come
all
the
way
from
england
on
purpose
to
see
the
dance
i
therefore
request
that
you
will
dance
it
with
care
and
attention
with
force
of
imagination
with
a
sense
of
pleasurable
anticipation
and
with
humble
respect
to
the
naked
truth
he
spoke
with
the
precise
eloquence
of
intoxication
and
as
he
flopped
to
the
ground
again
wigram
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
with
a
bravo
old
man
geoffrey
felt
very
silent
and
rather
sick
chonkina
the
little
women
made
a
show
of
modesty
hiding
their
faces
behind
their
long
kimono
sleeves
a
servant
girl
pushed
open
the
walls
which
communicated
with
the
next
room
an
exact
replica
of
the
one
in
which
they
were
sitting
an
elderly
woman
in
a
kimono
was
squatting
there
silent
rigid
and
dignified
for
a
moment
geoffrey
thought
that
a
mistake
had
been
made
that
this
was
another
guest
disturbed
in
quiet
reflection
and
about
to
be
justly
indignant
but
no
this
roman
matron
held
in
her
lap
the
white
disc
of
a
the
native
banjo
upon
which
she
strummed
with
a
flat
white
bone
she
was
the
evening
orchestra
an
old
the
six
little
butterflies
lined
up
in
front
of
her
and
began
to
dance
not
our
western
dance
of
free
limbs
but
an
oriental
dance
from
the
hips
with
posturings
of
hands
and
feet
they
sang
a
harsh
faltering
song
without
any
apparent
relation
to
the
accompaniment
played
by
that
austere
dame
chonkina
the
six
little
figures
swayed
to
and
fro
chonkina
hoi
with
a
sharp
cry
the
song
and
dance
stopped
abruptly
the
six
dancers
stood
rigid
with
hands
held
out
in
different
attitudes
one
of
them
had
lost
the
first
round
and
must
pay
forfeit
off
came
the
broad
embroidered
sash
it
was
thrown
aside
and
the
raucous
singing
began
afresh
chonkina
hoi
the
same
girl
lost
again
and
amid
shrill
titterings
the
gorgeous
scarlet
kimono
fell
to
the
ground
she
was
left
standing
in
a
pretty
blue
of
light
silk
with
a
pale
pink
design
of
starred
all
over
it
chonkina
round
after
round
the
game
was
played
and
first
one
girl
lost
and
then
another
two
of
them
were
standing
now
with
the
upper
part
of
their
bodies
bare
one
of
them
was
wearing
a
kind
of
white
lace
petticoat
stained
and
wrapped
about
her
hips
the
other
wore
short
flannel
drawers
like
a
man
coloured
in
a
union
jack
pattern
some
sailor
offering
to
his
they
were
both
of
them
young
girls
their
breasts
were
flat
and
shapeless
the
yellow
skin
ended
abruptly
at
the
throat
and
neck
with
the
powder
line
for
the
neck
and
face
were
a
glaze
of
white
the
effect
of
this
break
was
to
make
the
body
look
as
if
it
had
lost
its
real
head
under
the
guillotine
and
had
received
an
substitute
from
the
surgeon
hands
chonkina
patterson
had
drawn
nearer
to
the
performers
his
red
face
and
his
grim
smile
were
tokens
of
what
he
would
have
described
as
pleasurable
anticipation
wigram
too
his
flabby
visage
paler
than
ever
his
large
eyes
bulging
and
his
mouth
hanging
open
gazed
as
in
a
trance
he
had
whispered
to
geoffrey
i
seen
the
du
at
algiers
but
this
beats
anything
geoffrey
from
behind
the
fumes
of
the
watched
the
unreal
phantasmagoria
as
he
might
have
watched
a
dream
chonkina
the
dance
was
more
expressive
now
not
of
art
but
of
mere
animalism
the
bodies
shook
and
squirmed
the
faces
were
screwed
up
to
express
an
ecstacy
of
sensual
delight
the
little
fingers
twitched
into
immodest
gestures
chonkina
hoi
geoffrey
had
never
gazed
on
a
naked
woman
except
idealised
in
marble
or
on
canvas
the
secret
of
venus
had
been
for
him
as
for
many
men
an
inviolate
mecca
towards
which
he
worshipped
glimpses
he
had
seen
visions
of
soft
curves
mica
glistenings
of
creamy
skin
but
never
the
crude
anatomical
fact
an
overgrown
embryo
she
seemed
a
gawkish
thing
woman
thought
geoffrey
should
be
supple
and
pliant
with
a
suggestion
of
swiftness
galvanising
the
delicacy
of
the
lines
atalanta
was
his
ideal
woman
but
this
creature
had
apparently
no
bones
or
sinews
she
looked
like
a
sawdust
dummy
she
seemed
to
have
been
poured
into
a
bag
of
brown
tissue
there
was
no
waist
line
the
chest
appeared
to
fit
down
upon
the
thighs
like
a
lid
the
legs
hung
from
the
hips
like
and
seemed
to
fit
into
the
feet
like
poles
into
their
sockets
the
toes
were
ridiculous
and
exasperating
there
was
no
shaping
of
breasts
stomach
knees
and
ankles
there
was
nothing
in
this
image
of
clay
to
show
the
loving
caress
of
the
creator
hand
it
had
been
modelled
by
a
wretched
bungler
in
a
moment
of
inattention
yet
it
stood
there
erect
and
challenging
this
miserable
human
tadpole
usurping
the
throne
of
lais
and
crowned
with
the
worship
of
such
devotees
as
patterson
and
wigram
are
all
women
ugly
the
query
flashed
through
geoffrey
brain
is
the
vision
of
aphrodite
anadyomene
an
artist
lie
then
he
thought
of
asako
stripped
of
her
gauzy
nightdresses
was
she
like
this
a
shame
on
such
imagining
patterson
was
hugging
a
girl
on
his
knee
wigram
had
caught
hold
of
another
geoffrey
said
but
nobody
heard
him
it
getting
too
hot
for
me
here
i
going
so
he
went
his
little
wife
was
awake
and
disposed
to
be
tearful
where
have
you
been
she
asked
you
said
you
would
only
be
half
an
hour
i
met
wigram
said
geoffrey
and
i
went
with
him
to
see
some
dancing
you
might
have
taken
me
was
it
very
pretty
no
it
was
very
ugly
you
would
not
have
cared
for
it
at
all

the
traveller
in
japan
is
restricted
to
a
road
dictated
to
him
by
thos
cook
and
son
and
by
the
tourists
information
bureau
this
is
marked
by
hotels
of
varying
quality
by
insidious
and
by
native
guides
serious
and
profane
who
classify
foreigners
under
the
two
headings
of

and
the
lonely
are
naturally
supposed
to
have

taken
to

and
to

who
offer
the
highest
commission
to

guides
there
is
always
an
air
of
petty
conspiracy
in
the
wake
of
every
foreigner
who
visits
the
country
if
he
is
a
japan
enthusiast
he
is
amused
by
the
naive
ways
and
accepts
the
conventional
smile
as
the
reflection
of
the
heart
of
the
happy
little
japs
if
he
hates
the
country
he
takes
it
for
granted
that
extortion
and
villainy
will
accompany
his
steps
geoffrey
and
asako
enjoyed
immensely
their
introduction
to
japan
the
unpleasant
experiences
of
nagasaki
were
soon
forgotten
after
their
arrival
at
kyoto
the
ancient
capital
of
the
mikado
where
the
charm
of
old
japan
still
lingers
they
were
happy
innocent
people
devoted
to
each
other
easily
pleased
and
having
heaps
of
money
to
spend
they
were
amused
with
everything
with
the
people
with
the
houses
with
the
shops
with
being
stared
at
with
being
cheated
with
being
dragged
to
the
ends
of
the
vast
city
only
to
see
flowerless
gardens
and
temples
in
decay
asako
especially
was
entranced
the
feel
of
the
japanese
silk
and
the
sight
of
bright
colours
and
pretty
patterns
awoke
in
her
a
kind
of
ancestral
memory
the
craving
of
generations
of
japanese
women
she
bought
kimonos
by
the
dozen
and
spent
hours
trying
them
on
amid
a
chorus
of
admiring
chambermaids
and
waitresses
a
chorus
specially
trained
by
the
hotel
management
in
the
difficult
art
of
admiring
foreigners
purchases
then
to
the
the
antique
shops
of
kyoto
give
to
the
simple
foreigner
the
impression
that
he
is
being
received
in
a
private
home
by
a
japanese
gentleman
of
leisure
whose
hobby
is
collecting
the
unsuspecting
prey

welcomed
with
cigarettes
and

thick

are

of

him

him

shop
after
all
taking

of
his

and
tastes
they
force
him
to
buy
what
pleases
them
just
as
a
conjurer
can
force

card
upon
his
audience
the

rooms
at
the
miyako
hotel

became
like
an
annex
to
the
in

store
brocades
and
kimonos
were
draped
over
chairs
and
bedsteads
tables
were
crowded
with
porcelain
and
statues
of
gods
lanterns
hung
from
the
roof
and
in
a
corner
of
the
room
stood
an
enormous
bell
as
big
as
a
bath
resting
on
a
tripod
of
red
lacquer
when
struck
with
a
thick
leather
baton
like
a
it
uttered
a
deep
sob
a
wonderful
round
perfect
sound
full
of
the
melancholy
of
the
wind
and
the
of
the
austere
dignity
of
a
vanishing
civilisation
and
the
loneliness
of
the
buddhist
law
there
was
a
temple
on
the
hill
behind
the
hotel
whence
such
a
note
reached
the
visitors
at
dawn
and
again
at
sunset
the
spirit
of
everything
lovely
in
the
country
sang
in
its
tones
and
asako
and
geoffrey
had
agreed
that
whatever
else
they
might
buy
or
not
buy
they
must
take
an
echo
of
that
imprisoned
music
home
with
them
to
england
so
they
bought
the
cyclopean
voice
engraved
with
cabalistic
writing
which
might
be
as
it
professed
to
be
a
temple
bell
of
yamato
over
five
hundred
years
old
or
else
the
last
year
product
of
an
osaka
foundry
for
antique
brass
ware
geoffrey
called
it
big
ben
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
all
these
things
he
asked
his
wife
oh
for
our
home
in
london
she
answered
clapping
her
hands
and
gazing
with
ecstatic
pride
at
all
her
treasures
it
will
be
wonderful
oh
geoffrey
geoffrey
you
are
so
good
to
give
all
this
to
me
but
it
is
your
own
money
little
sweetheart
never
did
asako
seem
further
from
her
parents
race
than
during
the
first
weeks
of
her
sojourn
in
her
native
country
she
was
so
unconscious
of
her
relationship
that
she
liked
to
play
at
imitating
native
life
as
something
utterly
peculiar
and
absurd
meals
in
japanese
amused
her
immensely
the
squatting
on
bare
floors
the
exaggerated
obeisance
of
the
the
queer
food
the
clumsy
use
of
the
numbness
of
her
feet
after
being
sat
upon
for
half
an
hour
all
would
set
her
off
in
peals
of
unchecked
laughter
so
as
to
astonish
her
compatriots
who
naturally
enough
mistook
her
for
one
of
themselves
once
with
the
aid
of
the
girls
of
the
hotel
she
arrayed
herself
in
the
garments
of
a
japanese
lady
of
position
with
her
hair
dressed
in
the
shiny
black
and
her
waist
encased
in
the
broad
tight
or
sash
which
after
all
was
no
more
uncomfortable
than
a
corset
thus
attired
she
came
down
to
dinner
one
evening
trotting
behind
her
husband
as
a
japanese
wife
should
do
in
foreign
dress
she
appeared
and
exotic
but
one
would
have
hesitated
to
name
the
land
of
her
birth
it
was
a
shock
to
geoffrey
to
see
her
again
in
her
native
costume
in
europe
it
had
been
a
distinction
but
here
in
japan
it
was
like
a
sudden
fading
into
the
landscape
he
had
never
realised
quite
how
entirely
his
wife
was
one
of
these
people
the
short
stature
and
the
shuffling
gait
the
tiny
delicate
hands
the
grooved
slit
of
the
eyelids
and
the
oval
of
the
face
were
pure
japanese
the
only
incongruous
elements
were
the
white
ivory
skin
which
however
is
a
beauty
not
unknown
among
japanese
women
also
and
above
all
the
expression
which
looked
out
of
the
dancing
eyes
and
the
red
mouth
ripe
for
kisses
an
expression
of
freedom
happiness
and
natural
high
spirits
which
is
not
to
be
seen
in
a
land
where
the
women
are
hardly
free
never
natural
and
seldom
happy
the
japanese
woman
face
develops
a
compressed
look
which
leaves
the
features
a
mere
mask
and
acquires
very
often
a
furtive
glance
as
of
a
animal
by
fear
something
or
vixenish
flaunting
her
native
costume
asako
came
down
to
dinner
at
the
miyako
hotel
laughing
chattering
and
imitating
the
mincing
steps
of
her
and
their
exaggerated
politeness
geoffrey
tried
to
play
his
part
in
the
little
comedy
but
his
good
spirits
were
forced
and
gradually
silence
fell
between
them
the
silence
which
falls
on
masqueraders
in
fancy
dress
who
have
tried
to
play
up
to
the
spirit
of
their
costume
but
whose
imagination
flags
had
geoffrey
been
able
to
think
a
little
more
deeply
he
would
have
realized
that
this
was
a
very
visible
sign
of
the
gulf
which
yawned
between
his
wife
and
the
yellow
women
of
japan
she
was
acting
as
a
white
woman
might
have
done
certain
of
the
impossibility
of
confusion
but
geoffrey
for
the
first
time
felt
his
wife
exoticism
not
from
the
romantic
and
charming
side
but
from
the
ugly
sinister
and
horrible
word
inferior
side
of
it
had
he
married
a
coloured
woman
was
he
a
squaw
man
a
sickening
vision
of
at
nagasaki
rose
before
his
imagination
when
dinner
was
over
and
after
asako
had
received
the
congratulations
of
the
other
guests
she
retired
upstairs
to
put
on
her
geoffrey
liked
a
cigar
after
dinner
but
asako
objected
to
the
heavy
aroma
hanging
about
her
bedroom
they
therefore
parted
generally
for
this
brief
half
hour
and
afterwards
they
would
read
and
talk
together
in
their
like
other
people
they
soon
got
into
the
habit
of
going
to
bed
early
in
a
country
where
there
were
no
theatres
playing
in
a
comprehensible
tongue
and
no
supper
restaurants
to
turn
night
into
day
geoffrey
lit
his
cigar
and
made
his
way
to
the
two
elderly
men
merchants
from
kobe
were
already
sitting
there
over
whiskies
and
sodas
discussing
a
mutual
acquaintance
no
i
do
see
much
of
him
one
of
them
an
american
was
saying
nobody
does
nowadays
but
take
my
word
when
he
came
out
here
as
a
young
man
he
was
one
of
the
smartest
young
fellows
in
the
east
yes
i
can
quite
believe
you
said
the
other
a
stolid
englishman
with
a
briar
pipe
he
struck
me
as
an
exceptionally
man
he
was
more
than
that
i
tell
you
he
was
a
financial
genius
he
was
a
man
with
a
great
future
poor
fellow
said
the
other
well
he
has
only
got
himself
to
thank
geoffrey
was
not
an
eavesdropper
by
nature
but
he
found
himself
getting
interested
in
the
fate
of
this
anonymous
failure
and
wondered
if
he
was
going
to
hear
the
cause
of
the
man
downfall
when
these
japanese
women
get
hold
of
a
man
the
american
went
on
they
seem
to
drain
the
brightness
out
of
him
why
you
have
only
got
to
stroll
around
to
the
kobe
club
and
look
at
the
faces
you
can
tell
the
ones
that
have
japanese
wives
or
housekeepers
right
away
something
seems
to
have
gone
right
out
of
their
expression
it
worry
said
the
englishman
a
fellow
marries
a
japanese
girl
and
he
finds
he
has
to
keep
all
her
lazy
relatives
as
well
and
then
a
crowd
of
brats
come
along
and
he
does
know
whether
they
are
his
own
or
not
it
is
more
than
that
was
the
emphatic
answer
men
with
white
wives
have
worry
enough
and
a
man
can
go
gay
in
the
and
none
the
worse
but
when
once
they
marry
them
it
is
like
signing
a
bond
with
the
devil
that
man
damned
geoffrey
rose
and
left
the
room
he
thought
on
the
whole
it
was
better
to
withdraw
than
to
hit
that
yankee
hard
in
the
eye
he
felt
that
his
wife
had
been
insulted
but
the
speaker
could
not
have
known
by
whom
he
had
been
overheard
he
had
merely
expressed
an
opinion
which
as
a
sudden
instinct
told
geoffrey
must
be
generally
prevalent
among
the
white
people
living
in
this
yellow
country
now
that
he
came
to
think
of
it
he
remembered
curious
glances
cast
at
him
and
asako
by
foreigners
and
also
strange
to
say
by
japanese
glances
half
contemptuous
had
he
acquired
it
already
that
expression
which
marked
the
faces
of
the
unfortunates
at
the
kobe
club
he
remembered
also
tactless
remarks
on
board
ship
such
as
barrington
has
lived
all
her
life
in
england
of
course
that
makes
all
the
difference
geoffrey
looked
at
his
reflection
in
the
long
mirror
in
the
hall
there
were
no
signs
as
yet
of
premature
damnation
on
the
honest
healthy
british
face
there
were
signs
perhaps
of
ripened
thought
and
experience
of
less
superficial
appreciation
the
eyes
seemed
to
have
withdrawn
deeper
into
their
sockets
like
the
figurines
in
toy
barometers
when
they
feel
wet
weather
coming
he
was
beginning
to
appreciate
the
force
of
the
advice
which
had
urged
him
to
beware
of
japan
here
in
the
hotbed
of
race
prejudice
evil
spirits
were
abroad
it
was
so
different
in
tolerant
london
asako
was
charming
and
rich
she
was
received
everywhere
to
marry
her
was
no
more
strange
than
to
marry
a
french
girl
or
a
russian
they
could
have
lived
peaceably
in
europe
and
her
distant
fatherland
would
have
added
a
pathetic
charm
to
her
personality
but
here
in
japan
where
between
the
handful
of
whites
and
the
myriads
of
yellow
men
stretches
a
no
man
land
serrated
and
desolate
marked
with
bloody
fights
with
suspicions
and
treacheries
asako
position
as
the
wife
of
a
white
man
and
geoffrey
position
as
the
husband
of
a
yellow
wife
were
entirely
different
the
stranger
phrases
had
summed
up
the
situation
they
were
no
good
these
white
men
who
had
pawned
their
lives
to
yellow
girls
they
were
the
failures
the
geoffrey
had
heard
of
promising
young
officers
in
india
who
had
married
native
women
and
who
had
had
to
leave
the
service
he
had
done
the
same
better
go
gay
in
the
with
wigram
he
was
the
husband
of
a
coloured
woman
and
then
the
crowd
of
brats
in
england
one
hardly
ever
thinks
of
the
progeny
of
mixed
races
that
bitter
word
is
a
distant
echo
of
sensational
novels
geoffrey
had
not
as
yet
noticed
the
pale
handsome
children
of
eurasia
nature
latest
and
most
experiment
whose
seed
they
say
is
lost
in
the
third
generation
but
he
had
heard
the
tone
of
scorn
which
flung
out
the
term
and
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
his
own
children
would
be
he
was
walking
on
the
garden
terrace
overlooking
the
starry
city
he
was
thinking
with
an
intensity
unfamiliar
to
him
and
terrifying
like
a
machine
which
is
developing
its
fullest
power
and
is
shaking
a
framework
unused
to
such
a
strain
he
wanted
a
friend
presence
a
desultory
chat
with
an
old
pal
about
people
and
things
which
they
shared
in
common
thank
god
reggie
forsyth
was
in
tokyo
he
would
leave
he
must
see
reggie
laugh
at
his
queer
clever
talk
again
relax
himself
and
feel
sane
he
was
nervous
of
meeting
his
wife
lest
her
instinct
might
guess
his
thoughts
yet
he
must
not
leave
her
any
longer
or
his
absence
would
make
her
anxious
not
that
his
love
for
asako
had
been
damaged
but
he
felt
that
they
were
traveling
along
a
narrow
path
over
a
bottomless
gulf
in
an
unexplored
country
he
returned
to
the
rooms
and
found
her
lying
disconsolate
on
a
sofa
wrapped
in
a
flimsy
one
of
the
spoils
of
paris
her
hair
had
been
rapidly
combed
out
of
its
formal
native
arrangement
it
looked
draggled
and
hard
as
though
she
had
been
bathing
titine
the
french
maid
was
removing
the
rejected
débris
of
kimono
and
sash
sweetheart
you
been
crying
said
geoffrey
kissing
her
you
did
like
me
as
a
jap
and
you
been
thinking
terrible
things
about
me
look
at
me
and
tell
me
what
you
have
been
thinking
little
yum
yum
talks
great
nonsense
sometimes
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
thinking
of
going
on
to
tokyo
i
think
we
seen
about
all
there
is
to
be
seen
here
do
you
geoffrey
you
want
to
see
reggie
forsyth
you
getting
bored
and
homesick
already
no
i
not
i
think
it
is
a
ripping
country
in
fact
i
want
to
see
more
of
it
what
i
am
wondering
is
whether
we
should
take
tanaka
this
made
asako
laugh
any
mention
of
tanaka
name
acted
as
a
talisman
of
mirth
tanaka
was
the
japanese
guide
who
had
fixed
himself
on
to
their
company
with
a
fine
flair
for
docile
and
profitable
travelers
he
was
a
very
small
man
small
even
for
a
japanese
but
plump
withal
his
back
view
looked
like
that
of
a
little
boy
an
illusion
accentuated
by
the
shortness
of
his
coat
and
his
small
straw
boater
with
its
colored
ribbon
even
when
he
turned
the
illusion
was
not
quite
dispelled
for
his
was
a
round
ruddy
chubby
face
with
dimples
a
face
with
big
cheeks
ripe
for
smacking
and
little
sunken
eyes
he
had
stalked
the
barringtons
during
their
first
excursion
on
foot
through
the
ancient
city
knowing
that
sooner
or
later
they
would
lose
their
way
when
the
opportunity
offered
itself
and
he
saw
them
gazing
vaguely
round
at
he
bore
down
upon
them
raising
his
hat
and
saying
can
i
assist
you
sir
yes
would
you
kindly
tell
me
the
way
to
the
miyako
hotel
asked
geoffrey
i
am
myself
answered
tanaka
indeed
we
meet
very
on
the
way
he
had
discoursed
about
all
there
was
to
be
seen
in
kyoto
only
visitors
must
know
their
way
about
or
must
have
the
service
of
an
experienced
guide
who
was
and
who
knew
the
open
sesames
he
pronounced
this
phrase
open
sessums
and
it
was
not
until
late
that
night
that
its
meaning
dawned
upon
geoffrey
tanaka
had
a
rich
collection
of
foreign
and
idiomatic
phrases
which
he
must
have
learned
by
heart
from
a
book
and
with
which
he
adorned
his
conversation
on
his
own
initiative
he
had
appeared
next
morning
to
conduct
the
two
visitors
to
the
emperor
palace
which
he
gave
them
to
understand
was
open
for
that
day
only
and
as
a
special
privilege
due
to
influence
while
expatiating
on
the
wonders
to
be
seen
he
brushed
geoffrey
clothes
and
arranged
them
with
the
care
of
a
trained
valet
in
the
evening
when
they
returned
to
the
hotel
and
asako
complained
of
pains
in
her
shoulder
tanaka
showed
himself
to
be
an
adept
at
massage
next
morning
he
was
again
at
his
post
and
geoffrey
realized
that
another
member
had
been
added
to
his
household
he
acted
as
their
or
siseroan
as
he
pronounced
it
to
temple
treasuries
and
old
palace
gardens
to
and
to
little
native
the
barringtons
submitted
not
because
they
liked
tanaka
but
because
they
were
and
rather
lost
in
this
new
country
besides
tanaka
clung
like
a
leech
and
was
useful
in
many
ways
only
on
sunday
morning
it
was
the
hotel
boy
who
brought
their
early
morning
tea
tanaka
was
absent
when
he
made
his
appearance
he
wore
a
grave
expression
which
hardly
suited
his
round
face
and
he
carried
a
large
black
he
explained
that
he
had
been
to
church
he
was
a
christian
greek
orthodox
at
least
so
he
said
but
afterwards
geoffrey
was
inclined
to
think
that
this
was
only
one
of
his
mystifications
to
gain
the
sympathy
of
his
victims
and
to
create
a
bond
between
him
and
them
his
method
was
one
of
observation
imitation
and
concealed
interrogation
the
long
visits
to
the
barringtons
rooms
the
time
spent
in
and
in
massage
were
so
much
opportunity
gained
for
inspecting
the
room
and
its
inhabitants
for
gauging
their
habits
and
their
income
and
for
scheming
out
how
to
derive
the
greatest
possible
advantage
for
himself
the
first
results
of
this
process
were
almost
unconscious
the
wide
collar
in
which
his
face
had
wobbled
disappeared
and
a
small
double
collar
like
the
kind
geoffrey
wore
took
its
place
the
garish
and
hatband
were
replaced
by
discreet
black
he
acquired
the
attitudes
and
gestures
of
his
employer
in
a
few
days
as
for
the
it
took
place
in
the
evening
when
geoffrey
was
tired
and
tanaka
was
taking
off
his
boots
previous
to
the
tanaka
began
did
lady
barrington
live
long
time
in
japan
he
was
lavish
with
titles
considering
that
money
and
nobility
in
such
people
must
be
inseparable
besides
experience
had
taught
him
that
the
use
of
such
honorifics
never
came
amiss
no
she
left
when
she
was
quite
a
little
baby
ladyship

japanese
name
asako
fujinami
do
you
know
the
name
tanaka
the
japanese
set
his
head
on
one
side
to
indicate
an
attitude
of
reflection

suggested
yes

his
to
relatives
of
ladyship
yes
i
suppose
so
when
we
go
to
tokyo
ladyship
relatives
have
noble
residence
asked
tanaka
it
was
his
way
of
inquiring
if
they
were
rich
i
really
do
know
at
all
answered
geoffrey
then
i
will
detect
for
lordship
it
will
be
better
a
man
can
do
great
foolishness
if
he
does
not
detect
after
this
geoffrey
discouraged
tanaka
but
asako
thought
him
a
huge
joke
he
made
himself
very
useful
and
agreeable
fetching
and
carrying
for
her
and
amusing
her
with
his
wonderful
english
he
almost
succeeded
in
dislodging
titine
from
her
cares
for
her
person
geoffrey
had
once
objected
on
being
expelled
from
his
bedroom
during
a
change
of
raiment
but
tanaka
was
there
you
do
mind
him
seeing
you
apparently
asako
had
burst
out
laughing
oh
he
is
a
man
he
is
real
at
all
he
says
that
i
am
like
a
flower
and
that
i
am
very
beautiful
in
that
sounds
real
enough
grunted
geoffrey
and
very
like
a
man
perhaps
innocent
as
she
was
asako
enjoyed
playing
off
tanaka
against
her
husband
just
as
it
certainly
amused
her
to
watch
the
jealousy
between
titine
and
the
japanese
it
gave
her
a
pleasant
sense
of
power
to
see
her
big
husband
look
so
indignant
how
old
do
you
think
tanaka
is
he
asked
her
one
day
oh
about
eighteen
or
nineteen
she
answered
she
was
not
yet
used
to
the
deceptiveness
of
japanese
appearances
he
does
not
look
more
sometimes
said
her
husband
but
he
has
the
ways
and
the
experience
of
a
very
old
hand
i
would
mind
betting
you
that
he
is
thirty
all
right
said
asako
give
me
the
jade
buddha
if
you
are
wrong
and
what
will
you
give
me
if
i
am
right
said
geoffrey
kisses
replied
his
wife
geoffrey
went
out
to
look
for
tanaka
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
came
back
triumphant
my
kisses
sweetheart
he
demanded
wait
said
asako
how
old
is
he
i
went
out
of
the
front
door
and
there
was
master
tanaka
telling
the
the
latest
gossip
about
us
i
said
to
him
are
you
married
lordship
he
answered
am
widower
children
i
asked
again
have
two
progenies
he
said
are
soldiers
of
his
majesty
the
emperor
how
old
are
you
i
asked
years
he
answered
are
very
well
preserved
for
a
man
of
your
age
i
said
and
i
have
come
back
for
my
kisses
after
this
monstrous
deception
geoffrey
had
declared
that
he
would
dismiss
tanaka
a
man
who
goes
about
like
that
he
said
is
a
living
lie
two
days
later
early
in
the
morning
they
left
kyoto
by
the
great
metal
high
road
of
japan
which
has
replaced
the
famous
way
known
as
the
sacred
in
history
legend
and
art
every
stone
has
its
message
for
japanese
eyes
every
tree
its
association
with
poetry
or
romance
even
among
western
connoisseurs
of
japanese
wood
engraving
its
resting
places
are
as
familiar
as
the
stations
of
the
cross
such
is
the
the
road
between
the
two
capitals
of
kyoto
and
tokyo
still
haunted
by
the
ghosts
of
the
emperor
wagons
the
lacquered
palanquins
by
feudal
warriors
in
their
armour
and
by
the
swinging
strides
of
the
look
look
fujiyama
there
was
a
movement
in
the
where
geoffrey
and
his
wife
were
watching
the
unfolding
of
their
new
country
the
sea
was
away
to
the
right
beyond
the
and
the
to
the
left
was
the
base
of
a
mountain
its
summit
was
wrapped
in
cloud
from
the
fragment
visible
it
was
possible
to
appreciate
the
architecture
of
the
whole
pede
it
took
the
train
quite
one
hour
to
travel
over
that
arc
of
the
circuit
of
fuji
which
it
must
pass
on
its
way
to
tokyo
during
this
time
the
curtained
presence
of
the
great
mountain
dominated
the
landscape
everything
seemed
to
lead
up
to
that
mantle
of
cloud
the
terraced
rice
fields
rose
towards
it
the
trees
slanted
towards
it
the
moorland
seemed
to
be
pulled
upwards
and
the
skin
of
the
earth
was
stretched
taut
over
some
giant
limb
which
had
pushed
itself
up
from
below
the
calm
sea
was
waiting
for
its
reflection
and
even
the
microscopic
train
seemed
to
swing
in
its
orbit
round
the
mountain
like
an
unwilling
satellite
it
a
pity
we
ca
see
it
said
geoffrey
yes
it
the
only
big
thing
in
the
whole
darned
country
said
a
saturnine
american
sitting
opposite
and
then
when
you
get
on
to
it
it
just
a
heap
of
cinders
asako
was
not
worrying
about
the
landscape
her
thoughts
were
directed
to
a
family
of
japanese
passengers
who
had
settled
in
the
observation
car
for
half
an
hour
or
so
and
had
then
withdrawn
there
was
a
father
his
wife
and
two
daughters
figures
who
did
not
utter
a
word
but
glided
in
and
out
of
the
compartment
were
they
relations
of
hers
then
when
she
and
her
husband
passed
down
the
corridor
train
to
lunch
and
through
the
swarming
carriages
she
wondered
once
more
as
she
saw
male
japan
sprawling
its
length
over
the
seats
in
the
ugliest
attitudes
of
repose
and
female
japan
squatting
and
cleaning
ears
and
nostrils
with
scraps
of
paper
or
wiping
stolid
babies
the
carriages
swarmed
with
children
with
luggage
and
litter
the
floors
were
a
mess
of
spilled
tea
broken
earthenware
cups
and
splintered
wooden
boxes
cheap
baggage
was
piled
up
everywhere
with
wicker
baskets
paper
parcels
bundles
of
wraps
and
cases
of
imitation
leather
among
this
débris
children
were
playing
unchecked
smearing
their
faces
with
rice
cakes
and
squashing
the
flies
on
the
window
pane
were
any
of
these
her
relatives
asako
shuddered
how
much
did
she
actually
know
about
these
cousins
she
could
just
remember
her
father
she
could
recall
great
brown
shining
eyes
and
a
thin
face
wasted
by
the
consumption
which
killed
him
and
a
tenderness
of
voice
and
manner
quite
apart
from
anything
which
she
had
ever
experienced
since
this
soon
came
to
an
end
after
that
she
had
known
only
the
conscientiously
chilly
care
of
the
muratas
they
had
told
her
that
her
mother
had
died
when
she
was
born
and
that
her
father
was
so
unhappy
that
he
had
left
japan
forever
her
father
was
a
very
clever
man
he
had
read
all
the
english
and
french
and
german
books
he
had
left
special
word
when
he
was
dying
that
asako
was
not
to
go
back
to
japan
that
japanese
men
were
bad
to
women
that
she
was
to
be
brought
up
among
french
girls
and
was
to
marry
a
european
or
an
american
but
the
muratas
could
not
tell
her
any
intimate
details
about
her
father
whom
they
had
not
known
very
well
again
although
they
were
aware
that
she
had
rich
cousins
living
in
tokyo
they
did
not
know
them
personally
and
could
tell
her
nothing
her
father
had
left
no
papers
only
his
photograph
the
picture
of
a
delicate
man
in
black
cloak
and
kimono
and
a
little
french
book
called
de
at
the
end
of
which
was
written
the
address
of
ito
the
lawyer
in
tokyo
through
whom
the
dividends
were
paid

nagara
while
this
dewdrop
world
is
but
a
dewdrop
world
yet
all
the
same
the
fabric
of
our
lives
is
like
a
piece
of
knitting
terribly
botched
and
bungled
in
most
cases
there
are
stitches
which
are
dropped
sometimes
to
be
swallowed
up
and
forgotten
in
the
superstructure
sometimes
to
be
picked
up
again
after
a
lapse
of
years
these
stitches
are
old
friendships
the
first
stitch
from
geoffrey
bachelor
days
to
be
worked
back
into
the
scheme
of
his
married
life
was
his
friendship
for
reggie
forsyth
who
had
been
best
man
at
his
wedding
and
who
had
since
then
been
appointed
secretary
to
the
embassy
at
tokyo
reggie
had
received
a
telegram
saying
that
geoffrey
was
coming
he
was
very
pleased
he
had
reached
that
stage
in
the
progress
of
exile
where
one
is
inordinately
happy
to
see
any
old
friend
in
fact
he
was
beginning
to
be
fed
up
with
japan
with
its
very
limited
distractions
and
with
the
monotony
of
his
diplomatic
colleagues
instead
of
going
to
the
tennis
court
which
was
his
usual
afternoon
occupation
he
had
spent
the
time
in
arranging
his
rooms
shifting
the
furniture
rehanging
the
pictures
paying
especial
care
to
the
disposition
of
his
oriental
curios
his
recent
purchases
his
last
enthusiasms
in
this
land
of
languor
reggie
collected
buddhas
chinese
and
lacquered
medicine
cases
called
in
japanese
caviare
to
the
general
murmured
reggie
as
he
gloated
over
a
chaste
design
of
fishes
in
a
poor
old
geoffrey
he
only
a
barbarian
but
perhaps
she
will
be
interested
here
t
he
called
out
to
an
impassive
japanese
have
the
flowers
come
yet
and
the
little
trees
t
produced
from
the
back
regions
of
the
house
a
quantity
of
dwarf
trees
planted
as
miniature
landscapes
in
shallow
porcelain
dishes
and
big
fronds
of
budding
cherry
blossom
reggie
arranged
the
blossom
in
a
triumphal
arch
over
the
corner
table
where
stood
the
silent
company
of
the
buddhas
from
among
the
trees
he
chose
his
favourite
a
kind
of
dwarf
cedar
to
place
between
the
window
opening
on
to
a
sunny
veranda
and
an
old
gold
screen
across
whose
tender
glory
wound
the
variegated
comicality
of
an
traveling
procession
painted
by
a
kano
artist
of
three
centuries
ago
he
removed
the
books
which
were
lying
about
the
room
grim
japanese
grammars
and
forbidding
works
on
international
law
and
in
their
place
he
left
volumes
of
poetry
and
memoirs
and
english
strewn
about
in
artistic
disorder
then
he
gave
the
silver
frames
of
his
photographs
to
to
to
be
polished
the
photographs
of
fair
women
signed
with
christian
names
of
diplomats
in
grand
uniforms
and
of
handsome
foreigners
having
reduced
the
serious
atmosphere
of
his
study
so
as
to
give
an
impression
of
amiable
indolence
reggie
forsyth
lit
a
cigarette
and
strolled
out
into
the
garden
amused
at
his
own
impatience
in
london
he
would
never
have
bestirred
himself
for
old
geoffrey
barrington
who
was
only
a
philistine
after
all
with
no
sense
of
the
inwardness
of
things
reggie
was
a
slim
and
graceful
young
man
with
thin
fair
hair
brushed
flat
back
from
his
forehead
a
certain
projection
of
bones
under
the
face
gave
him
an
almost
haggard
look
and
his
dancing
blue
eyes
seemed
to
be
never
still
he
wore
a
suit
of
navy
serge
fitting
close
to
his
figure
black
tie
and
grey
spats
in
fact
he
was
as
immaculate
as
a
young
diplomat
should
always
be
outside
his
broad
veranda
was
a
gravel
path
and
beyond
that
a
japanese
garden
the
hobby
of
one
of
his
predecessors
a
miniature
domain
of
hillocks
and
shrubs
with
the
inevitable
pebbly
water
course
in
which
a
bronze
crane
was
perpetually
fishing
over
the
wall
which
encircles
the
embassy
compound
the
reddish
buds
of
a
cherry
avenue
were
bursting
in
white
stars
the
compound
of
the
embassy
is
a
fragment
of
british
soil
the
british
flag
floats
over
it
and
the
japanese
authorities
have
no
power
within
its
walls
its
large
population
of
japanese
servants
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
in
all
are
free
from
the
burden
of
japanese
taxes
and
since
the
police
may
not
enter
gambling
forbidden
throughout
the
empire
flourishes
there
and
the
rambling
servants
quarters
behind
the
ambassador
house
are
the
monte
carlo
of
the
tokyo
coachman
and
rickshaw
runner
however
since
the
alarming
discovery
that
a
professional
burglar
had
been
occupying
an
old
tub
in
a
corner
of
the
wide
grounds
a
policeman
has
been
allowed
to
patrol
the
garden
but
he
has
to
drop
that
omnipotent
swagger
which
marks
his
presence
outside
the
walls
except
for
reggie
forsyth
exotic
shrubbery
there
is
nothing
japanese
within
the
solid
red
walls
the
embassy
itself
is
the
house
of
a
prosperous
city
gentleman
and
might
be
transplanted
to
bromley
or
wimbledon
the
smaller
houses
of
the
secretaries
and
the
interpreters
also
wear
a
smug
suburban
appearance
with
their
red
brick
and
their
gabling
only
the
broad
verandas
betray
the
intrusion
of
a
warmer
sun
than
ours
the
lawns
were
laid
out
as
a
miniature
the
thick
masses
of
japanese
shrubs
forming
deadly
bunkers
and
reggie
was
trying
some
mashie
shots
when
one
of
the
rare
tokyo
carrying
geoffrey
barrington
inside
it
came
slowly
round
a
corner
of
the
drive
as
though
it
were
feeling
its
way
for
its
destination
among
such
a
cluster
of
houses
geoffrey
was
alone
hello
old
chap
cried
reggie
running
up
and
shaking
his
big
paw
in
his
small
nervous
grip
i
so
awfully
glad
to
see
you
but
where
mrs
barrington
geoffrey
had
not
brought
his
wife
he
explained
that
they
had
been
to
pay
their
first
call
on
japanese
relations
and
that
they
had
been
honourably
out
but
even
so
the
strain
had
been
a
severe
one
and
asako
had
retired
to
rest
at
the
hotel
but
why
not
come
and
stay
here
with
me
suggested
reggie
i
have
got
plenty
of
spare
rooms
and
there
is
such
a
gulf
fixed
between
people
who
inhabit
hotels
and
people
with
houses
of
their
own
they
see
life
from
an
entirely
different
point
of
view
their
spirits
hardly
ever
meet
have
you
room
for
eight
large
boxes
of
dresses
and
kimonos
several
cases
of
curios
a
french
maid
a
japanese
guide
two
japanese
dogs
and
a
monkey
from
singapore
reggie
whistled
no
really
is
it
as
bad
as
all
that
i
was
thinking
that
marriage
meant
just
one
extra
person
it
would
have
been
fun
having
you
both
here
and
this
is
the
only
place
in
tokyo
fit
to
live
in
it
looks
a
comfortable
little
place
agreed
geoffrey
they
had
reached
the
secretary
house
and
the
newcomer
was
admiring
its
artistic
arrangement
just
like
your
rooms
in
london
reggie
prided
himself
on
the
exclusively
oriental
character
of
his
habitation
and
its
distinction
from
any
other
dwelling
place
which
he
had
ever
possessed
but
then
geoffrey
was
only
a
philistine
after
all
i
suppose
it
the
photographs
which
look
like
old
times
geoffrey
went
on
how
little
véronique
veronica
married
an
argentine
beef
magnate
a
german
jew
the
nastiest
person
i
have
ever
avoided
meeting
poor
old
reggie
was
that
why
you
came
to
japan
partly
and
partly
because
i
had
a
chief
in
the
foreign
office
who
dared
to
say
that
i
was
lacking
in
practical
experience
of
diplomacy
he
sent
me
to
this
comic
country
to
find
it
and
you
have
found
it
right
enough
said
geoffrey
inspecting
a
photograph
of
a
japanese
girl
in
her
dark
silk
kimono
with
a
dainty
flower
pattern
round
the
skirts
and
at
the
fall
of
the
long
sleeves
she
was
not
unlike
asako
only
there
was
a
fraction
of
an
inch
more
of
bridge
to
her
nose
and
in
that
fraction
lay
the
secret
of
her
birth
that
is
my
latest
inspiration
said
reggie
listen
he
sat
down
at
the
piano
and
played
a
plaintive
little
air
small
and
sweet
and
shivering
he
explained
then
he
changed
the
burden
of
his
song
into
a
melody
rapid
and
winding
with
curious
tricklings
among
the
bass
notes
lamia
said
reggie
or
lilith
there
no
tune
in
that
last
one
you
ca
whistle
it
said
geoffrey
who
exaggerated
his
philistinism
to
throw
reggie
artistic
nature
into
stronger
relief
but
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
the
lady
her
name
is
smith
said
reggie
i
know
it
is
almost
impossible
and
terribly
sad
but
her
other
name
is
yaé
rather
wild
and
savage
it
like
the
cry
of
a
bird
in
the
or
of
a
cannibal
tribe
on
the
warpath
and
is
this
your
oriental
version
of
véronique
asked
his
friend
no
said
reggie
it
is
a
different
chapter
of
experience
altogether
perhaps
old
hardwick
was
right
i
still
have
much
to
learn
thank
god
véronique
was
personal
yaé
is
symbolic
she
is
my
model
just
like
a
painter
model
only
more
platonic
she
is
the
east
to
me
for
i
can
not
understand
the
east
pure
and
undiluted
she
is
a
of
mine
on
her
father
side
and
therefore
easier
to
understand
impersonality
and
fatalism
the
eastern
proteus
in
the
grip
of
and
idealism
the
british
hercules
a
butterfly
body
with
this
cosmic
war
shaking
it
incessantly
poor
child
no
wonder
she
seems
always
tired
she
is
a
asked
geoffrey
bad
word
bad
word
she
is
and
caste
suggests
india
and
suttees
she
is
a
eurasian
a
denizen
of
a
dream
country
which
has
a
melodious
name
and
no
geographical
existence
have
you
ever
heard
anybody
ask
where
eurasia
was
i
have
a
traveling
member
of
parliament
wife
at
the
embassy
here
only
a
few
months
ago
i
said
that
it
was
a
large
undiscovered
country
lying
between
the
equator
and
tierra
del
fuego
she
seemed
quite
satisfied
and
wondered
whether
it
was
very
hot
there
she
remembered
having
heard
a
missionary
once
complain
that
the
eurasians
wore
so
very
few
clothes
but
to
return
to
yaé
you
must
meet
her
this
evening
no
then
you
will
like
her
because
she
looks
something
like
asako
and
she
will
adore
you
because
you
are
utterly
unlike
me
she
comes
here
to
inspire
me
once
or
twice
a
week
she
says
she
likes
me
because
everything
in
my
house
smells
so
sweet
that
is
the
beginning
of
love
i
sometimes
think
love
enters
the
soul
through
the
nostrils
if
you
doubt
me
observe
the
animals
but
foreign
houses
in
japan
are
haunted
by
a
smell
of
dust
and
mildew
you
can
not
love
in
them
she
likes
to
lie
on
my
sofa
and
smoke
cigarettes
and
do
nothing
and
listen
to
my
playing
tunes
about
her
you
are
very
impressionable
said
his
friend
if
it
were
anybody
else
i
should
say
you
were
in
love
with
this
girl
i
am
still
the
same
geoffrey
always
in
love
and
never
but
what
about
the
other
people
here
barrington
asked
there
are
none
none
who
count
i
am
not
impressionable
i
am
just
i
have
to
focus
my
weak
vision
on
one
person
and
neglect
the
rest
a
rickshaw
was
waiting
to
take
geoffrey
back
to
the
hotel
under
the
saffron
light
of
an
uncanny
sunset
which
barred
the
western
heavens
with
three
broad
streaks
of
orange
and
like
a
gypsy
kerchief
the
odd
little
vehicle
rolled
down
the
hill
of
miyakezaka
which
overhangs
the
moat
of
the
imperial
palace
the
latent
soul
of
tokyo
the
mystery
of
japan
lies
within
the
confines
of
that
moat
which
is
the
only
great
majestic
thing
in
an
untidy
rambling
village
of
more
than
two
million
living
beings
the
palace
of
the
mikado
a
title
by
the
way
which
is
never
used
among
japanese
is
hidden
from
sight
that
is
the
first
remarkable
thing
about
it
the
gesture
of
versailles
the
challenge
of
the
majestic
vulgarity
which
the
millionaire
of
the
moment
can
mimic
with
a
vulgarity
less
majestic
are
here
entirely
absent
and
one
can
not
mimic
the
invisible
hardly
on
bare
winter
days
when
the
sheltering
groves
are
stripped
and
the
saddened
heart
is
in
need
of
reassurance
appears
a
green
lustre
of
copper
roofs
the
at
tokyo
is
not
a
sovereign
palace
it
is
the
abode
of
a
god
the
surrounding
woods
and
gardens
occupy
a
space
larger
than
hyde
park
in
the
very
centre
of
the
city
one
road
crosses
an
extreme
corner
of
this
estate
elsewhere
only
privileged
feet
may
tread
this
is
a
vast
encumbrance
in
a
modern
commercial
metropolis
but
a
striking
tribute
to
the
unseen
the
most
noticeable
feature
of
the
palace
is
its
moats
these
lie
in
three
or
four
concentric
circles
the
defences
of
ancient
yedo
whose
outer
lines
have
now
been
filled
up
by
modern
progress
and
an
electric
railway
they
are
broad
sheets
of
water
as
wide
as
the
thames
at
oxford
where
ducks
are
floating
and
fishing
beyond
is
a
of
vivid
grass
a
hundred
feet
high
at
some
points
topped
by
vast
walls
of
cyclopean
with
the
sudden
angles
of
a
vauban
fortress
above
these
walls
the
weird
of
japan
extend
their
lean
tormented
boughs
within
is
the
emperor
domain
geoffrey
was
hurrying
homeward
along
the
banks
of
the
moat
the
stagnant
viscous
water
was
yellow
under
the
sunset
and
a
yellow
light
hung
over
the
green
slopes
the
grey
walls
and
the
dark
tree
tops
an
echelon
of
geese
passed
high
overhead
in
the
region
of
the
pale
moon
within
the
mysterious
of
the
son
of
heaven
the
crows
were
uttering
their
harsh
sarcastic
croak
witchery
is
abroad
in
tokyo
during
this
brief
sunset
hour
the
mongrel
nature
of
the
city
is
less
evident
the
pretentious
government
buildings
of
the
new
japan
assume
dignity
with
the
deep
shadows
and
the
heightening
effect
of
the
darkness
the
untidy
network
of
tangled
wires
fades
into
the
coming
obscurity
the
rickety
trams
packed
to
overflowing
with
the
city
crowds
returning
homeward
become
creeping
caterpillars
of
light
lights
spring
up
along
the
banks
of
the
moat
more
lights
are
reflected
from
its
depth
dark
shadows
gather
like
a
frown
round
the
gate
of
the
cherry
field
where
ii
kamon
no
blood
stained
the
winter
some
sixty
years
ago
because
he
dared
to
open
the
country
of
the
gods
to
the
contemptible
foreigners
and
in
the
cry
of
the
echoes
the
voice
of
old
japan
a
wail
drowned
at
last
by
the
grinding
of
the
tram
wheels
and
the
lash
and
crackle
of
the
against
the
overhead
lines
geoffrey
sitting
back
in
his
rickshaw
turned
up
his
and
watched
the
gathering
pall
of
cloud
extinguishing
the
sunset
looks
like
snow
he
said
to
himself
but
it
is
impossible
at
the
entrance
to
the
imperial
hotel
a
government
institution
as
almost
everything
in
japan
ultimately
turns
out
to
be
tanaka
was
standing
in
his
characteristic
attitude
of
a
dog
who
waits
for
his
master
return
characteristically
also
he
was
talking
to
a
man
a
japanese
a
showy
person
with
spectacles
and
oily
moustaches
dressed
in
a
vivid
suit
however
at
approach
this
individual
raised
his
bobbed
and
vanished
and
tanaka
assisted
his
patron
to
descend
from
his
rickshaw
as
he
approached
the
door
of
his
suite
a
little
cloud
of
hotel
scattered
like
sparrows
this
phenomenon
did
not
as
yet
mean
anything
to
geoffrey
the
native
servants
were
not
very
real
to
him
but
he
was
soon
to
realize
that
the
mister
boy
as
his
dignity
now
insists
on
being
called
is
more
than
an
amusing
contribution
to
the
local
atmosphere
when
his
smiles
his
bows
and
his
peculiar
english
begin
to
pall
he
reveals
himself
in
his
true
light
as
a
constant
annoyance
and
a
possible
danger
hell
knows
no
fury
like
the
untipped
he
refuses
to
answer
the
bell
he
suddenly
understands
no
english
at
all
he
bangs
all
the
doors
he
spends
his
spare
moments
in
devising
all
kinds
of
petty
annoyances
damp
and
dirty
sheets
accidental
damage
to
property
surreptitious
draughts
and
to
vex
one
is
to
antagonize
the
whole
caste
it
is
a
boycott
at
last
the
tip
is
given
sudden
sunshine
obsequious
manners
attention
of
all
kinds
for
ever
dwindling
periods
until
at
last
the
attains
his
end
a
fat
retaining
fee
extorted
at
regular
intervals
but
even
more
exasperating
since
no
largesse
can
cure
it
is
his
national
bent
towards
espionage
what
does
he
do
with
his
spare
time
of
which
he
has
so
much
he
spends
it
in
watching
and
listening
to
the
hotel
guests
he
has
heard
legends
of
large
sums
paid
for
silence
or
for
speech
there
may
be
money
in
it
therefore
and
there
is
always
amusement
so
the
only
housework
which
the
does
really
willingly
is
to
dust
the
door
polish
the
handle
wipe
the
threshold
anything
in
fact
which
brings
him
into
the
propinquity
of
the
keyhole
what
he
observes
or
overhears
he
exchanges
with
another
and
the
hall
porter
or
the
head
waiter
generally
serves
as
chief
intelligence
bureau
and
is
always
in
touch
with
the
police
the
arrival
of
guests
so
remarkable
as
the
barringtons
became
therefore
at
once
a
focus
for
the
curiosity
the
ambition
of
the
and
a
had
told
the
lodgekeeper
whose
wife
told
the
wife
of
one
of
the
cooks
who
told
the
head
waiter
that
there
was
some
connection
between
these
visitors
and
the
rich
fujinami
all
the
knew
what
the
fujinami
meant
so
here
was
a
cornucopia
of
unwholesome
secrets
it
was
the
most
likely
game
which
had
arrived
at
the
imperial
hotel
for
years
ever
since
the
american
wife
who
ran
away
with
a
san
francisco
chinaman
but
to
geoffrey
when
he
broke
up
the
gathering
the
were
just
a
lot
of
queer
little
japs
asako
was
lying
on
her
sofa
reading
titine
was
brushing
her
hair
asako
when
she
read
which
was
not
often
preferred
literature
of
the
sentimental
school
books
like
with
stained
glass
in
them
and
tragedy
overcome
by
nobleness
of
character
i
been
lonely
without
you
and
nervous
she
said
and
i
had
a
visitor
already
she
pointed
to
a
card
lying
on
a
small
round
table
a
flimsy
card
printed
not
engraved
on
pasteboard
geoffrey
picked
it
up
with
a
smile

asked
japanese
letters

printed
on
one
side
and

on
the

fellow
who

did
you

him
oh
no
i
was
much
too
weary
but
he
has
only
just
gone
you
probably
passed
him
on
the
stairs
geoffrey
could
only
think
of
the
vivid
gentleman
who
had
been
talking
with
tanaka
the
guide
was
sent
for
and
questioned
but
he
knew
nothing
the
gentleman
in

had
merely
stopped
to
ask

next

it
was
snowing
and
bitterly
cold
snow
in
japan
snow

april
snow
upon
the
cherry
trees
what
hospitality
was
this
the
snow
fell
all
day
muffling
the
silent
city
silence
is
at
all
times
one
of
tokyo
characteristics
for
so
large
and
important
a
metropolis
it
is
strangely
silent
always
the
only
continuous
street
noise
is
the
grating
and
crackling
of
the
trams
the
lumbering
of
horse
vehicles
and
the
pulsation
of
motor
traffic
are
absent
for
as
beasts
of
burden
horses
are
more
costly
than
men
and
in
motor
cars
were
still
a
novelty
since
the
war
boom
of
course
every
nouveau
riche
has
rushed
to
buy
his
car
but
even
so
the
state
of
the
roads
which
alternate
between
boulders
and
slush
do
not
encourage
the
motorist
and
are
impassable
for
heavy
lorries
so
incredible
weights
and
bundles
are
moved
on
and
bales
of
goods
and
stacks
of
produce
are
punted
down
the
dark
waterways
which
give
to
parts
of
tokyo
a
venetian
picturesqueness
passengers
too
proud
to
walk
flit
past
noiselessly
in
rickshaws
which
are
not
as
many
believe
an
ancient
and
typical
oriental
conveyance
but
the
modern
invention
of
an
english
missionary
called
robinson
the
hum
of
the
city
is
dominated
by
the
screech
of
the
tramcars
in
the
principal
streets
and
by
the
patter
of
the
wooden
clogs
an
incessant
irritating
sound
like
rain
but
these
were
now
hushed
by
the
snow
neither
the
snow
nor
the
other
of
nature
discouragements
can
keep
the
japanese
for
long
indoors
perhaps
it
is
because
their
own
houses
are
so
draughty
and
uncomfortable
this
day
they
were
out
in
their
thousands
men
and
women
drifting
aimlessly
along
the
pavements
as
is
their
wont
wrapped
in
grey
ulsters
their
necks
protected
by
ragged
furs
pathetic
spoils
of
domestic
tabbies
and
their
heads
sheltered
under
those
wide
umbrellas
which
have
become
a
symbol
of
japan
in
foreign
eyes
the
gigantic
sunflowers
of
rainy
weather
huge
blooms
of
dark
blue
or
black
or
orange
inscribed
with
the
name
and
address
of
the
owner
in
cursive
japanese
script
most
of
these
people
are
wearing
high
wooden
clogs
perilous
to
the
balance
which
raise
them
as
on
stilts
above
the
street
level
and
add
to
the
fantastical
appearance
of
these
silent
shuffling
multitudes
the
snow
falls
covering
the
city
meannesses
its
vulgar
apings
of
americanisms
its
crude
advertisements
on
the
other
hand
the
true
native
architecture
asserts
itself
and
becomes
more
than
ever
attractive
the
white
purity
seems
to
gather
all
this
miniature
perfection
these
irregular
roofs
these
chalet
balconies
these
broad
walls
and
studies
in
rock
and
tree
under
a
cape
its
natural
winter
garment
the
first
chill
of
the
rough
weather
kept
geoffrey
and
asako
by
their
fireside
but
the
indoor
amenities
of
japanese
hotel
life
are
few
there
is
a
staleness
in
the
public
rooms
and
an
angular
discord
in
the
private
which
condemn
the
idea
of
a
comfortable
day
of
reading
or
of
writing
to
friends
at
home
about
the
spirit
of
the
east
so
at
the
end
of
the
first
half
of
a
desolate
afternoon
a
visit
to
the
embassy
suggested
itself
they
left
the
hotel
ushered
on
their
way
by
bowing
and
in
a
few
minutes
an
unsteady
careless
of
obstacles
and
had
whirled
them
through
the
slushy
streets
into
the
british
compound
which
only
wanted
a
robin
to
look
like
the
conventional
christmas
card
it
was
a
pleasant
shock
after
long
traveling
through
countries
modernized
in
a
hurry
to
be
received
by
an
english
butler
against
a
background
of
thick
turkey
carpet
mahogany
hall
table
and
buhl
clock
it
was
like
a
bar
of
music
to
see
the
fall
of
snowy
white
cards
accumulating
in
their
silver
bowl
lady
cynthia
cairns
was
not
an
artistic
apartment
it
was
too
comfortable
for
that
there
were
too
many
chairs
and
sofas
and
they
were
designed
on
broad
lines
for
the
stolid
permanent
sitting
of
stout
comfortable
bodies
there
were
too
many
photographs
on
view
of
persons
distinguished
for
their
solidity
rather
than
for
their
good
looks
the
portraits
of
the
guests
whom
one
would
expect
to
find
installed
in
those
chairs
a
grand
piano
was
there
but
the
absence
of
any
music
in
its
neighbourhood
indicated
that
its
purpose
was
chiefly
to
symbolize
harmony
in
the
home
life
and
to
provide
a
spacious
for
the
overflowing
from
many
tables
these
were
dominated
by
a
large
signed
photograph
of
queen
victoria
in
front
of
an
open
fireplace
where
bright
logs
were
crackling
slept
an
enormous
black
cat
on
a
leopard
skin
hearthrug
out
of
this
sea
of
easy
circumstances
rose
lady
cynthia
a
daughter
of
the
famous
earl
of
cheviot
hers
was
a
short
but
not
unmajestic
figure
encased
in
black
silks
which
rustled
and
showed
flashes
of
beads
and
jet
in
the
dancing
light
of
the
fire
she
had
the
firm
pose
of
a
man
and
a
face
entirely
masculine
with
strong
lips
and
chin
and
humourous
grey
eyes
the
face
of
a
judge
miss
gwendolen
cairns
who
had
apparently
been
reading
to
her
mother
when
the
visitors
arrived
was
a
tall
girl
with
fair
hair
the
simplicity
of
the
cut
of
her
dress
and
its
pale
green
color
showed
artistic
sympathies
of
the
old
aesthetic
kind
the
maintained
amiability
of
her
expression
and
manner
indicated
her
life
task
of
smoothing
down
feelings
ruffled
by
her
mother
asperities
and
of
oiling
the
track
of
her
father
career
how
are
you
my
dears
lady
cynthia
was
saying
i
so
glad
come
in
spite
of
the
tempest
gwendolen
was
just
reading
me
to
sleep
do
you
ever
read
to
your
husband
barrington
it
is
a
good
idea
if
only
your
voice
is
sufficiently
monotonous
i
hope
we
have
interrupted
you
murmured
asako
who
was
rather
alarmed
at
the
great
lady
manner
it
was
a
shock
when
i
heard
the
bell
ring
i
cried
out
in
my
sleep
did
i
gwendolen
and
said
the
beebees
i
glad
it
was
as
bad
as
all
that
said
geoffrey
coming
to
his
wife
rescue
would
that
have
been
the
worst
that
could
possibly
happen
the
very
worst
lady
cynthia
answered
professor
beebee
teaches
something
or
other
to
the
japanese
and
he
and
beebee
have
lived
in
japan
for
the
last
forty
years
they
remind
me
of
that
old
tortoise
at
the
zoo
who
has
lived
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
for
so
many
centuries
that
he
is
quite
covered
with
seaweed
and
barnacles
but
they
are
very
sorry
for
me
because
i
only
came
here
yesterday
they
arrive
almost
every
day
to
instruct
me
in
the
path
in
which
i
should
go
and
to
eat
my
cakes
by
the
dozen
they
do
have
any
dinner
the
days
they
come
here
for
tea
beebee
is
the
queen
of
the
goonies
who
are
the
goonies
asked
geoffrey
the
rest
of
the
old
tortoises
they
are
missionaries
and
professors
and
their
wives
and
daughters
the
sons
of
course
run
away
and
go
to
the
bad
there
are
quite
a
lot
of
the
goonies
and
i
see
much
more
of
them
than
i
do
of
the
and
the
and
the
and
all
the
eastern
things
which
gwendolen
will
talk
about
when
she
gets
home
she
is
going
to
write
a
book
poor
girl
there
nothing
else
to
do
in
this
country
except
to
write
about
what
is
not
here
it
very
easy
you
know
you
copy
it
all
out
of
some
one
else
book
only
you
illustrate
it
with
your
own
snapshots
the
publishers
say
that
there
is
a
small
but
steady
demand
chiefly
for
circulating
libraries
in
america
you
see
i
have
been
approached
already
on
the
subject
and
i
have
not
been
here
many
months
so
you
seen
reggie
forsyth
already
he
tells
me
what
do
you
think
of
him
much
the
same
as
usual
he
seemed
rather
bored
lady
cynthia
had
led
her
guest
away
from
the
fireside
where
gwendolen
cairns
was
burbling
to
asako
geoffrey
could
feel
the
searchlight
of
her
judicial
eye
upon
him
and
a
sensation
like
the
pause
when
a
great
man
enters
a
room
something
essential
was
going
to
invade
the
commonplace
talk
captain
barrington
your
coming
here
just
now
is
most
providential
reggie
forsyth
is
not
bored
at
all
far
from
it
i
thought
he
would
like
the
country
said
geoffrey
guardedly
he
does
like
the
country
why
should
he
but
he
likes
somebody
in
the
country
now
do
you
understand
yes
agreed
geoffrey
he
showed
me
the
photograph
of
a
half
japanese
girl
he
said
that
she
was
his
inspiration
for
local
colour
exactly
and
she
turning
his
brain
yellow
snapped
lady
cynthia
forgetting
as
everybody
else
did
including
geoffrey
himself
that
the
same
criticism
might
apply
to
asako
however
geoffrey
was
becoming
more
sensitive
of
late
he
blushed
a
little
and
fidgeted
but
he
answered
reggie
has
always
been
easily
inflammable
oh
in
england
perhaps
it
good
for
a
boy
education
but
out
here
captain
barrington
it
is
different
i
have
lived
for
a
long
time
east
of
suez
and
i
know
the
danger
of
these
love
episodes
in
countries
where
there
is
nothing
else
to
do
nothing
else
to
talk
about
i
am
a
gossip
myself
so
i
know
the
harm
gossip
can
do
but
is
it
so
serious
lady
cynthia
reggie
rather
laughed
about
it
to
me
he
said
am
in
love
always
and
never
she
is
a
dangerous
young
lady
said
the
ambassadress
two
years
ago
a
young
business
man
out
here
was
engaged
to
be
married
to
her
in
the
autumn
his
body
was
washed
ashore
near
yokohama
he
had
been
bathing
imprudently
and
yet
he
was
a
good
swimmer
last
year
two
officers
attached
to
the
embassy
fought
a
duel
and
one
was
badly
wounded
it
was
turned
into
an
accident
of
course
but
they
were
both
admirers
of
hers
this
year
it
is
reggie
turn
and
reggie
is
a
man
with
a
great
future
it
would
be
a
shame
to
lose
him
lady
cynthia
are
you
being
rather
pessimistic
besides
what
can
i
do
anything
everything
eat
with
him
drink
with
him
play
cards
with
him
go
to
the
dogs
with
him
no
what
a
pity
you
are
married
but
even
so
it
better
than
nothing
play
tennis
with
him
take
him
to
the
top
of
fujiyama
i
can
do
nothing
with
him
he
flouts
me
publicly
the
old
man
can
give
him
an
official
scolding
and
reginald
will
just
mimic
him
for
the
benefit
of
the
chancery
i
can
hear
them
laughing
all
the
way
from
here
when
reggie
is
doing
what
he
calls
one
of
his
but
you
why
he
can
see
in
your
face
the
whole
of
london
the
london
which
he
respects
and
appreciates
in
spite
of
his
cosmopolitan
airs
he
can
see
himself
introducing
miss
yaé
smith
in
lady
everington
as
mrs
forsyth
is
there
a
great
objection
asked
geoffrey
it
is
impossible
said
lady
cynthia
a
sudden
weariness
came
over
geoffrey
did
that
ruthless
impossible
apply
to
his
case
also
would
lady
everington
door
be
closed
to
him
on
his
return
was
he
guilty
of
that
worst
offence
against
good
form
a
or
was
asako
saved
by
her
money
something
unfair
was
impending
he
looked
at
the
two
girls
seated
by
the
fireside
sipping
their
tea
and
laughing
together
he
must
have
shown
signs
of
his
embarrassment
for
lady
cynthia
said
do
be
absurd
captain
barrington
the
case
is
entirely
different
a
lady
is
always
a
lady
whether
she
is
born
in
england
or
japan
miss
smith
is
not
a
lady
still
worse
she
is
a
the
daughter
of
an
adventurer
journalist
and
a
woman
what
can
one
expect
it
is
bad
blood
after
taking
leave
of
the
cairns
geoffrey
and
asako
crossed
the
garden
compound
white
and
under
its
covering
of
snow
they
found
their
way
down
the
which
led
to
the
discreet
seclusion
of
reggie
forsyth
domain
the
leaping
of
fire
shadows
against
the
lowered
blinds
gave
a
warm
and
welcoming
impression
of
shelter
and
comfort
and
still
more
welcoming
were
the
sounds
of
the
piano
it
was
a
pleasure
for
the
travellers
to
hear
for
they
had
long
been
unaccustomed
to
the
sound
of
music
music
should
be
the
voice
of
the
soul
of
the
house
in
the
discord
of
hotels
it
is
lost
and
scattered
but
the
home
which
is
without
music
is
dumb
and
imperfect
reggie
must
have
heard
them
coming
for
he
changed
the
dreamy
melody
which
he
was
playing
into
the
chorus
of
a
popular
song
which
had
been
rife
in
london
a
year
ago
geoffrey
laughed
father
home
again
father
home
again
he
hummed
fitting
the
words
to
the
tune
as
he
waited
for
the
door
to
open
they
were
greeted
in
the
passage
by
reggie
he
was
dressed
in
all
respects
like
a
japanese
gentleman
in
black
silk
cloak
brown
wadded
kimono
and
fluted
skirt
he
wore
white
socks
and
straw
slippers
it
is
a
becoming
and
sensible
dress
for
any
man
i
thought
it
must
be
you
he
laughed
so
i
played
the
watchword
fancy
you
being
so
homesick
already
please
come
in
harrington
i
have
often
longed
to
see
you
in
japan
but
i
never
thought
you
would
come
and
let
me
take
your
coat
off
you
will
find
it
quite
warm
indoors
it
was
warm
indeed
there
was
the
heat
of
a
in
artistically
ordered
room
it
was
larger
too
than
on
the
occasion
of
geoffrey
visit
for
the
folding
doors
which
led
into
a
further
apartment
were
thrown
open
two
big
fires
were
blazing
and
old
gold
screens
glittering
like
midas
treasury
warded
off
the
draught
from
the
windows
the
air
was
heavy
with
fumes
of
incense
still
rising
from
a
huge
brass
brazier
full
of
glowing
charcoal
and
grey
sand
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
in
one
corner
stood
the
buddha
table
twinkling
in
the
firelight
the
miniature
trees
were
disposed
along
the
inner
wall
there
was
no
other
furniture
except
an
enormous
black
cushion
lying
between
the
brazier
and
the
fireplace
and
in
the
middle
of
the
cushion
a
little
japanese
girl
she
was
squatting
on
her
toes
in
native
fashion
her
kimono
was
sapphire
blue
and
it
was
fastened
by
a
huge
silver
sash
with
a
blue
and
green
peacock
embroidered
on
the
fold
of
the
bow
which
looked
like
great
wings
and
was
almost
as
big
as
the
rest
of
the
little
person
put
together
her
back
was
turned
to
the
guests
and
she
was
gazing
into
the
flames
in
an
attitude
of
reverie
she
seemed
unconscious
of
everything
as
though
still
listening
to
the
echo
of
the
silent
music
reggie
in
his
haste
to
greet
his
visitors
had
not
noticed
the
hurried
solicitude
to
arrange
the
set
of
the
kimono
to
a
nicety
in
order
to
indicate
exactly
the
right
pose
she
looked
like
a
jeweled
butterfly
on
a
great
black
leaf
yaé
miss
smith
said
reggie
these
are
my
old
friends
whom
i
was
telling
you
about
the
small
creature
rose
slowly
with
a
dreamy
grace
and
stepped
off
her
cushion
as
a
fairy
might
alight
from
her
carriage
i
am
very
pleased
to
meet
you
she
purred
it
was
the
stock
american
phrase
which
has
crossed
the
pacific
westwards
but
the
citizen
brusqueness
was
replaced
by
the
condescension
of
a
queen
her
face
was
a
delicate
oval
of
the
same
creamy
smoothness
as
but
the
chin
which
in
asako
case
receded
a
trifle
in
obedience
to
japanese
canons
of
beauty
was
thrust
vigorously
forward
and
the
curved
lips
in
their
cupid
bow
seemed
moulded
for
kissing
by
generations
of
european
passions
whereas
about
japanese
mouths
there
is
always
something
sullen
and
pinched
and
colourless
the
bridge
of
her
nose
and
her
eyes
of
deep
olive
green
the
eyes
of
a
wildcat
gave
the
lie
to
her
mother
race
reggie
artistry
could
not
help
watching
the
two
women
together
with
appreciative
satisfaction
yaé
was
even
smaller
and
than
the
japanese
ever
since
he
had
first
met
yaé
smith
he
had
compared
and
contrasted
her
in
his
mind
with
asako
barrington
he
had
used
both
as
models
for
his
dainty
music
his
harmonies
he
was
wont
to
explain
came
to
him
in
woman
shape
to
express
japan
he
must
see
a
japanese
woman
not
that
he
had
any
interest
in
japanese
women
physically
they
are
too
different
from
our
women
he
used
to
think
and
the
difference
repelled
and
fascinated
him
it
is
so
wide
that
it
can
only
be
crossed
by
frank
sensuality
or
by
blind
imagination
but
the
artist
needs
his
interpreter
if
he
is
to
get
even
as
far
as
a
misunderstanding
so
in
figuring
to
himself
the
east
reggie
had
at
first
made
use
of
his
memory
of
asako
with
her
european
education
built
up
over
the
inheritance
of
japan
later
he
met
yaé
smith
through
the
paper
walls
of
whose
japanese
existence
the
instincts
of
her
scottish
forefathers
kept
forcing
their
unruly
way
geoffrey
could
not
define
his
thoughts
so
precisely
but
something
unruly
stirred
in
his
consciousness
when
he
saw
the
ghost
of
his
days
of
courtship
rise
before
him
in
the
deep
blue
kimono
his
wife
had
certainly
made
a
great
abdication
when
she
abandoned
her
native
dress
for
plain
blue
serges
of
course
he
could
not
have
asako
looking
like
a
doll
but
still
had
he
fallen
in
love
with
a
few
yards
of
silk
yaé
smith
seemed
most
anxious
to
please
in
spite
of
the
affectation
of
her
poses
which
perhaps
were
necessary
to
her
lest
looking
so
much
like
a
plaything
she
might
be
greeted
as
such
she
always
wanted
to
be
liked
by
people
this
was
her
leading
characteristic
it
was
at
the
root
of
her
frailties
a
soil
overfertilized
from
which
weeds
spring
apace
she
was
voluble
in
a
gentle
way
praising
the
rings
on
asako
fingers
and
the
cut
and
material
of
her
dress
but
her
eyes
were
forever
glancing
towards
geoffrey
he
was
so
very
tall
and
broad
standing
in
the
framework
of
the
folding
doors
beside
the
slim
figure
of
reggie
more
girlish
than
ever
in
the
skirts
of
his
kimono
captain
barrington
the
son
of
a
lord
how
fine
he
must
look
in
uniform
in
that
cavalry
uniform
with
the
silver
cuirass
and
the
plumed
helmet
like
the
english
soldiers
in
her
father
books
at
home
your
husband
is
very
big
she
said
to
asako
yes
he
is
said
asako
much
too
big
for
japan
oh
i
should
like
that
said
the
little
eurasian
it
must
be
nice
there
was
a
warmth
a
sincerity
in
the
tone
which
made
asako
stare
at
her
companion
but
the
childish
face
was
innocent
and
smiling
the
languid
curve
of
the
smile
and
the
opalescence
of
the
green
eyes
betrayed
none
of
their
secrets
to
asako
inexperience
reggie
sat
down
at
the
piano
and
still
watching
the
two
women
he
began
to
play
this
is
the
yaé
sonata
he
explained
to
geoffrey
it
began
with
some
bars
from
an
old
scottish
song
had
we
never
loved
so
sadly
had
we
never
loved
so
madly
never
loved
and
never
parted
we
had
been
insensibly
the
pathetic
melody
faded
away
into
the
beat
of
a
song
with
more
rhythm
than
tune
which
doubled
and
redoubled
its
pace
stumbling
and
leaping
up
again
over
strange
syncopations
all
of
a
sudden
the
musician
stopped
i
ca
describe
your
wife
now
that
i
see
her
he
said
i
know
any
dignified
old
japanese
music
something
like
the
of
couperin
only
in
a
setting
of
kyoto
and
gold
screens
and
then
there
must
be
a
dash
of
something
very
english
which
she
has
acquired
from
you
sweet
home
or
in
our
alley
never
mind
old
chap
said
geoffrey
play
home
again
reggie
shook
himself
and
then
struck
up
the
rolling
chorus
but
as
he
interpreted
it
his
mood
turned
pensive
again
the
tone
was
hushed
the
time
slower
the
vulgar
tune
expressed
itself
suddenly
in
deep
melancholy
it
brought
back
to
the
two
young
men
more
forcibly
than
the
most
inspired
the
memory
of
england
the
sparkle
of
the
theatres
the
street
din
of
london
and
the
warmth
of
good
company
all
that
had
seemed
sweet
to
them
in
a
time
which
was
distant
now
reggie
ceased
playing
the
two
girls
were
sitting
together
now
on
the
big
black
cushion
in
front
of
the
fire
they
were
looking
at
a
portfolio
of
japanese
prints
reggie
embryo
collection
the
young
diplomat
said
to
his
friend
geoffrey
you
not
been
in
the
east
long
enough
to
be
exasperated
by
it
i
have
so
our
ideas
will
not
be
in
sympathy
it
not
what
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
i
must
admit
everything
is
so
much
of
a
muchness
if
you
seen
one
temple
you
seen
the
lot
and
the
same
with
everything
here
that
is
the
first
stage
disappointment
we
have
heard
so
much
of
the
east
and
its
splendours
the
gorgeous
east
and
the
rest
of
it
the
reality
is
small
and
sordid
and
like
so
much
that
is
ugly
in
our
own
country
yes
they
wear
shocking
bad
clothes
do
they
directly
they
get
out
of
kimonos
and
even
the
kimonos
look
dingy
and
dirty
they
are
said
reggie
yours
would
be
if
you
had
to
keep
a
wife
and
eight
children
on
thirty
shillings
a
month
then
he
added
the
second
stage
in
the
observer
progress
is
discovery
have
you
read
lafcadio
hearn
books
about
japan
yes
some
of
them
answered
geoffrey
it
strikes
me
that
he
was
a
liar
no
he
was
a
poet
a
poet
and
he
jumped
over
the
first
stage
to
dwell
for
some
time
in
the
second
probably
because
he
was
by
nature
that
is
a
great
advantage
for
discoverers
but
what
do
you
mean
by
the
second
stage
the
stage
of
discovery
have
you
ever
walked
about
a
japanese
city
in
the
twilight
when
the
evening
bell
sounds
from
a
hidden
temple
have
you
turned
into
the
and
watched
the
men
returning
to
their
wise
little
houses
and
the
family
groups
assembled
to
meet
them
and
help
them
change
into
their
kimonos
have
you
heard
the
splashing
and
the
chatter
of
the
which
are
the
evening
clubs
of
the
common
people
and
the
great
of
gossip
have
you
heard
the
broken
music
tracking
you
down
a
street
of
houses
have
you
seen
the
herself
in
her
blue
cloak
sitting
rigid
and
expressionless
in
the
rickshaw
which
is
carrying
her
off
to
meet
her
lover
have
you
heard
the
drums
of
priapus
beating
from
the
gay
quarters
have
you
watched
the
crowds
which
gather
round
a
temple
festival
buying
queer
little
plants
for
their
homes
and
farthing
toys
for
their
children
crowding
to
the
booth
for
news
of
good
luck
and
bad
luck
throwing
their
penny
to
the
god
and
clapping
their
hands
to
attract
his
attention
have
you
seen
anything
of
this
without
a
feeling
of
deep
pleasure
and
a
wonder
as
to
how
these
people
live
and
think
what
we
have
got
in
common
with
them
and
what
we
have
got
to
learn
from
them
i
think
i
know
what
you
mean
said
geoffrey
it
all
very
picturesque
but
they
always
seem
to
be
hiding
something
exactly
said
his
friend
and
every
man
of
intelligence
who
has
to
live
in
this
country
thinks
that
he
need
only
learn
their
language
and
use
their
customs
and
then
he
will
find
out
what
is
hidden
that
is
what
lafcadio
hearn
did
and
that
is
why
i
wear
a
kimono
but
what
did
he
find
out
a
lot
of
pretty
stories
echoes
of
old
civilization
and
but
of
the
mind
and
heart
of
the
japanese
people
the
only
coloured
people
after
all
who
have
held
their
heads
up
against
the
white
races
little
or
nothing
until
he
reached
the
third
stage
disillusionment
then
he
wrote
an
which
is
his
best
book
i
have
read
it
you
ought
to
his
other
things
are
mere
melodies
the
kind
of
stuff
i
can
play
to
you
by
the
hour
this
is
a
serious
book
of
history
and
political
science
sounds
a
bit
dry
for
me
laughed
geoffrey
it
is
a
disillusioned
man
explanation
of
the
country
into
which
he
had
tried
to
sink
but
which
had
rejected
him
he
explains
the
present
by
the
past
that
is
reasonable
the
dead
are
the
real
rulers
of
japan
he
says
underneath
the
surface
changing
the
nation
is
deeply
conservative
suspicious
of
all
interference
and
unconventionally
sullenly
and
above
all
still
as
much
locked
in
its
primitive
family
system
as
it
was
a
thousand
years
ago
you
can
not
be
friends
with
a
japanese
unless
you
are
friends
with
his
family
and
you
can
not
be
friends
with
his
family
unless
you
belong
to
it
this
is
the
deadlock
and
this
is
why
we
never
get
any
forwarder
then
i
got
a
chance
since
i
got
a
japanese
family
i
do
know
of
course
said
reggie
but
i
should
think
they
would
have
much
use
for
you
they
will
receive
you
most
politely
but
they
will
look
upon
you
as
an
interloper
and
they
will
try
to
steer
you
out
of
the
country
but
my
wife
said
geoffrey
she
is
their
own
flesh
and
blood
after
all
well
of
course
i
do
know
but
if
they
are
extremely
friendly
i
should
look
out
if
i
were
you
the
japanese
are
conventionally
hospitable
but
they
are
not
cordial
to
strangers
unless
they
have
a
very
strong
motive
geoffrey
barrington
looked
in
the
direction
where
his
wife
was
seated
on
a
corner
of
the
big
cushion
turning
over
one
by
one
a
portfolio
full
of
woodprints
on
their
broad
white
mounts
the
firelight
flickered
round
her
like
a
crowd
of
importunate
thoughts
she
felt
that
he
was
looking
at
her
and
glanced
across
at
him
can
you
see
in
there
barrington
or
shall
i
turn
the
lights
on
asked
her
host
oh
no
answered
the
little
lady
that
would
spoil
it
the
pictures
look
quite
alive
in
the
firelight
what
a
lovely
collection
got
there
nothing
very
valuable
there
said
reggie
but
they
are
very
effective
i
think
even
the
cheap
ones
asako
was
holding
up
a
pied
engraving
of
a
sinuous
japanese
woman
an
utamaro
from
an
old
block
recut
in
dazzling
raiment
with
her
sash
tied
in
front
of
her
and
her
head
bristling
with
amber
pins
like
a
porcupine
geoffrey
will
you
please
take
me
to
see
the
yoshiwara
she
asked
the
request
dismayed
geoffrey
he
knew
well
enough
what
was
to
be
seen
at
the
yoshiwara
he
would
have
been
interested
to
visit
the
licensed
quarter
of
the
himself
in
the
company
of
say
reggie
forsyth
but
this
was
a
branch
of
inquiry
which
to
his
mind
should
be
reserved
for
men
alone
nice
women
never
think
of
such
things
that
his
own
wife
should
wish
to
see
the
place
and
worse
still
should
express
that
wish
in
public
was
a
blatant
offence
against
good
form
which
could
only
be
excused
by
her
innocent
ignorance
but
reggie
who
was
used
to
the
curiosity
of
every
tourist
male
and
female
about
the
of
tokyo
answered
readily
yes
barrington
it
well
worth
seeing
we
must
arrange
to
go
down
there
miss
smith
tells
me
said
asako
that
all
these
lovely
gay
creatures
are
yoshiwara
girls
and
that
you
can
see
them
there
now
not
that
identical
lady
of
course
said
reggie
who
had
joined
the
group
by
the
fireside
she
died
a
hundred
years
ago
but
her
professional
are
still
there
and
i
can
see
them
asako
clapped
her
hands
ladies
are
allowed
to
go
and
look
it
does
not
matter
it
is
not
improper
oh
no
said
yaé
smith
my
brothers
have
taken
me
would
you
like
to
go
yes
i
would
said
asako
glancing
at
her
husband
who
however
showed
no
signs
of
approval

whose
footfall

in

put
asunder
those
whom

joins
geoffrey
conscience
was
disturbed
his
face
was
lined
and
worried
with
thought
such
as
had
left
him
untroubled
since
the
effervescences
of
his
early
youth
like
many
young
men
of
his
caste
he
had
soon
submitted
all
the
baffling
riddles
of
conduct
to
the
thumb
rule
of
good
form
this
yoshiwara
question
was
to
him
something
more
than
a
moral
conundrum
it
was
a
subtle
attack
by
the
wife
of
his
bosom
aided
and
abetted
by
his
old
friend
reggie
forsyth
and
by
the
mysterious
forces
of
this
unfamiliar
land
as
typified
by
yaé
smith
against
the
citadel
of
good
form
against
the
stronghold
of
his
principles
geoffrey
himself
wished
to
see
the
yoshiwara
his
project
had
been
that
one
evening
when
asako
had
been
invited
to
dinner
by
friends
he
and
reggie
would
go
and
look
at
the
place
this
much
was
sanctioned
by
good
form
for
him
to
take
his
wife
there
and
for
people
to
know
that
he
had
done
so
would
be
the
worst
of
bad
form
the
conduct
of
a
rank
outsider
unfortunately
it
was
also
bad
form
for
him
to
discuss
the
matter
with
asako
a
terrible
dilemma
was
it
possible
that
the
laws
of
good
and
bad
form
were
only
locally
binding
and
that
here
in
japan
they
were
no
longer
valid
reggie
was
different
he
was
so
awfully
clever
he
could
extemporize
on
good
form
as
he
could
extemporize
on
the
piano
besides
he
was
a
victim
to
the
artistic
temperament
which
can
not
control
itself
but
reggie
had
not
been
improved
by
his
sojourn
in
this
queer
country
or
he
would
never
have
so
far
forgotten
himself
as
to
speak
in
such
a
way
in
the
presence
of
ladies
geoffrey
would
give
him
a
good
beating
at
tennis
and
then
having
reduced
him
to
a
fit
state
of
humility
he
would
have
it
out
with
him
for
barrington
was
not
a
man
to
nurse
displeasure
against
his
friends
the
tennis
courts
at
tokyo
which
stand
in
a
magnificent
central
position
one
day
to
be
occupied
by
the
japanese
houses
of
parliament
are
every
afternoon
the
meeting
place
for
youth
in
exile
with
a
sprinkling
of
japanese
some
of
whom
have
acquired
great
skill
at
the
game
towards
the
ladies
arrive
to
watch
the
evening
efforts
of
their
husbands
and
admirers
and
to
escort
them
home
when
the
light
begins
to
fail
so
the
tennis
courts
have
become
a
little
social
oasis
in
the
vast
desert
of
oriental
life
brilliant
it
is
not
sparkle
there
is
none
but
there
is
a
certain
chirpiness
the
forced
gaiety
of
caged
birds
the
day
was
warm
and
bright
the
snow
had
vanished
as
though
by
supernatural
command
geoffrey
enjoyed
his
game
thoroughly
although
he
was
beaten
being
out
of
practice
and
unused
to
gravel
courts
but
the
exercise
made
him
in
his
own
language
sweat
like
a
pig
and
he
felt
better
he
thought
he
would
shelve
the
unpleasant
subject
for
the
time
being
but
it
was
reggie
himself
who
revived
it
about
the
yoshiwara
he
said
seating
himself
on
one
of
the
benches
placed
round
the
courts
they
are
having
a
special
show
down
there
it
will
probably
be
worth
seeing
look
here
said
geoffrey
is
it
the
thing
for
ladies
english
ladies
to
go
to
a
place
like
that
of
course
answered
his
friend
it
is
one
of
the
sights
of
tokyo
why
i
went
with
lady
cynthia
not
so
long
ago
she
was
quite
fascinated
by
jove
geoffrey
ejaculated
but
for
a
young
girl
did
miss
cairns
go
too
not
on
that
occasion
but
i
have
no
doubt
she
has
been
but
is
it
much
the
same
as
taking
a
lady
to
a
public
brothel
not
in
the
least
was
reggie
answer
it
is
like
along
piccadilly
after
nightfall
looking
in
at
the
empire
and
returning
via
regent
street
and
in
paris
like
a
visit
to
the
and
the
it
is
the
local
version
of
an
old
theme
but
is
that
a
nice
sight
for
a
lady
it
is
what
every
lady
wants
to
see
reggie
what
rot
any
girl
geoffrey
old
man
would
like
to
see
the
place
yes
but
for
a
man
it
different
why
do
you
want
to
see
it
you
not
going
there
for
business
i
presume
why
for
curiosity
i
suppose
one
hears
such
a
lot
of
people
talk
about
the
yoshiwara
for
curiosity
that
right
and
do
you
really
think
that
women
even
women
have
less
curiosity
than
men
geoffrey
barrington
started
to
laugh
at
his
own
discomfiture
reggie
you
were
always
a
devil
for
arguing
he
said
at
home
one
would
never
talk
about
things
like
that
there
must
be
a
slight
difference
then
between
home
and
abroad
certain
bonds
are
relaxed
abroad
one
is
a
one
is
out
to
watch
the
appearance
and
habits
of
the
natives
in
a
mood
just
as
one
looks
at
animals
in
the
zoo
besides
nobody
knows
or
cares
who
one
is
one
has
no
awkward
responsibilities
towards
neighbours
and
there
is
little
or
no
danger
of
finding
an
intimate
acquaintance
in
an
embarrassing
position
in
london
one
lives
in
constant
dread
of
finding
people
out
but
my
wife
geoffrey
continued
troubled
once
more
i
imagine
barrington
may
be
an
exception
but
take
my
word
for
it
every
woman
however
good
and
holy
is
intensely
interested
in
the
lives
of
her
fallen
sisters
they
know
less
about
them
than
we
do
they
are
therefore
more
mysterious
and
interesting
to
them
and
yet
they
are
much
nearer
to
them
by
the
whole
difference
of
sex
there
is
always
a
personal
query
arising
too
might
have
chosen
that
life
what
would
it
have
brought
me
there
is
a
certain
compassion
too
and
above
all
there
is
the
intense
interest
of
rivalry
who
is
not
interested
in
his
and
what
woman
does
not
want
to
know
by
what
unholy
magic
her
unfair
competitor
holds
her
power
over
men
the
tennis
courts
were
filling
with
youths
released
from
offices
in
the
court
facing
them
two
young
fellows
had
begun
a
single
one
of
them
was
a
japanese
the
other
though
his
hair
and
eyes
were
of
the
native
breed
was
too
fair
of
skin
and
too
tall
of
stature
he
was
a
eurasian
they
both
played
exceedingly
well
the
rallies
were
long
sustained
the
drives
beautifully
timed
and
taken
the
few
unemployed
about
the
courts
soon
made
this
game
the
object
of
their
special
attention
who
are
they
asked
geoffrey
glad
to
change
the
conversation
that
aubrey
smith
yaé
brother
one
of
the
best
players
here
and
viscount
kamimura
who
ought
to
be
quite
the
best
but
he
has
just
married
and
his
wife
will
not
let
him
play
often
enough
oh
exclaimed
geoffrey
he
was
on
the
ship
with
us
coming
out
he
had
not
recognised
the
young
japanese
he
had
not
expected
to
meet
him
somehow
in
such
a
european
kamimura
had
noticed
his
however
and
when
the
set
was
over
and
the
players
had
changed
sides
he
came
up
and
greeted
him
most
cordially
i
hear
you
are
already
married
said
geoffrey
our
best
congratulations
thank
you
replied
kamimura
blushing
japanese
blush
readily
in
spite
of
their
complexion
we
japanese
must
not
boast
about
our
wives
it
is
what
you
call
bad
form
but
i
would
like
her
to
meet
barrington
she
speaks
english
not
so
badly
yes
said
geoffrey
i
hope
you
will
come
and
dine
with
us
one
evening
at
the
imperial
thank
you
very
much
answered
the
young
viscount
how
long
are
you
staying
in
japan
oh
for
some
months
then
we
shall
meet
often
i
hope
he
said
and
returned
to
his
game
a
very
decent
fellow
quite
human
reggie
commented
yes
is
he
said
geoffrey
and
then
he
asked
suddenly
do
you
think
he
would
take
his
wife
to
see
the
yoshiwara
probably
not
but
then
they
are
japanese
people
living
in
japan
that
alters
everything
i
do
think
so
said
geoffrey
and
he
was
conscious
of
having
scored
off
his
friend
for
once
miss
yaé
smith
had
arrived
on
her
daily
visit
to
the
courts
she
was
already
surrounded
by
a
little
retinue
of
young
men
who
however
scattered
at
reggie
approach
miss
yaé
smiled
graciously
on
the
two
and
inquired
after
barrington
it
was
so
nice
to
talk
with
her
the
other
day
it
was
like
being
in
england
again
yes
miss
yaé
had
been
in
england
and
in
america
too
she
preferred
those
countries
very
much
to
japan
it
was
so
much
more
amusing
there
was
so
little
to
do
here
besides
in
japan
it
was
such
a
small
world
and
everybody
was
so
disagreeable
especially
the
women
always
saying
untrue
unkind
things
she
looked
so
immaterial
and
in
her
blue
kimono
her
strange
eyes
downcast
as
her
habit
was
when
talking
about
herself
and
her
own
doings
that
geoffrey
could
think
no
evil
of
her
nor
could
he
wonder
at
reggie
gaze
of
intense
admiration
which
beat
upon
her
like
sunlight
on
a
picture
however
asako
must
be
waiting
for
him
he
took
his
leave
and
returned
to
his
hotel
asako
had
been
entertaining
a
visitor
she
had
gone
out
shopping
for
an
hour
not
altogether
pleased
to
find
herself
alone
on
her
return
a
japanese
gentleman
in
a
vivid
green
suit
had
risen
from
a
seat
in
the
lounge
of
the
hotel
and
had
introduced
himself
i
am
ito
your
he
was
a
small
podgy
person
with
a
round
oily
face
and
heavy
voluted
moustaches
the
expression
of
his
eyes
was
hidden
behind
spectacles
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
a
european
to
guess
his
age
anything
between
and
fifty
his
thick
hair
was
brushed
up
on
his
forehead
in
a
curl
his
teeth
glittered
with
dentist
gold
he
wore
a
tweed
suit
of
bright
colour
a
rainbow
tie
and
yellow
boots
over
the
bulge
of
an
stomach
hung
a
massive
gold
blossoming
into
a
charm
which
might
be
a
masonic
emblem
or
a
cycling
club
badge
his
breastpocket
appeared
to
hold
a
quiverful
of
how
do
you
do
harrington
i
am
pleased
to
meet
you
the
voice
was
high
and
squeaky
like
a
boy
voice
when
it
is
breaking
the
extended
hand
was
soft
and
greasy
in
spite
of
its
attempt
at
a
firm
grip
with
elaborate
politeness
he
ushered
harrington
into
her
chair
he
took
his
place
close
beside
her
crossed
his
fat
legs
and
stuck
his
thumbs
into
his
i
am
your
friend
ito
he
began
your
father
friend
and
i
am
sure
to
be
your
friend
too
but
for
the
reference
to
her
father
she
would
have
snubbed
him
she
decided
to
give
him
tea
in
the
lounge
and
not
to
invite
him
to
her
private
rooms
a
growing
distrust
of
her
countrymen
arising
largely
from
observation
of
the
ways
of
tanaka
was
making
little
asako
less
confiding
than
of
yore
she
was
still
ready
to
be
amused
by
them
but
she
was
becoming
less
credulous
of
the
japanese
pose
of
simplicity
and
the
conventional
smile
however
she
was
soon
melted
by
kindliness
of
manner
he
patted
her
hand
and
called
her
little
girl
i
am
your
old
lawyer
he
kept
on
saying
your
father
friend
and
your
best
friend
too
anything
you
want
just
ring
me
and
you
have
it
there
my
number
do
forget
now
shiba
what
do
you
think
of
japan
now
beautiful
country
i
think
and
you
have
not
yet
seen
miyanoshita
or
kamakura
or
nikko
temples
you

not
yet
got

i
think
indeed
i
am
sorry
for
you
that

a
very
wrong
thing
i
shall
at
once
order
for
you
a
very
splendid
automobile
and
we
must
make
a
grand
trip
every
rich
and
noble
person
possesses
splendid
automobile
oh
that
would
be
nice
asako
clapped
her
hands
japan
is
so
pretty
i
do
want
to
see
more
of
it
but
i
must
ask
my
husband
about
buying
the
motor
ito
laughed
a
fat
oily
laugh
indeed
that
is
japanese
style
little
girl
japanese
wife
say
ask
my
husband
american
style
wife
very
different
she
say
husband
do
this
do
that
like
coolie
i
have
travelled
much
abroad
i
know
american
custom
very
well
my
husband
gives
me
all
i
want
and
a
great
deal
more
said
asako
he
is
very
kind
man
grinned
the
lawyer
because
the
money
is
all
yours
not
his
at
all
ha
ha
then
seeing
that
his
officiousness
was
overstepping
the
mark
he
added
i
know
american
ladies
very
well
they
do
give
money
to
their
husbands
they
tell
their
husbands
give
money
to
me
they
just
do
everything
themselves
writing
cheques
all
the
time
really
said
asako
but
my
husband
is
the
kindest
and
best
man
in
the
world
quite
right
quite
right
love
your
husband
like
a
good
little
girl
but
do
forget
your
old
lawyer
ito
i
was
your
father
friend
we
were
at
school
together
here
in
tokyo
this
interested
asako
immensely
she
tried
to
make
the
lawyer
talk
further
but
he
said
that
it
was
a
very
long
story
and
he
must
tell
her
some
other
time
then
she
asked
him
about
her
cousin
fujinami
gentaro
he
is
away
from
town
just
now
when
he
returns
i
think
he
will
invite
you
to
splendid
feast
with
that
he
took
his
leave
what
do
you
think
of
him
asako
asked
tanaka
who
had
been
watching
the
interview
with
an
attendant
chorus
of
he
is
gentleman
was
the
reply
now
is
a
native
corruption
of
the
words
high
collar
and
denoted
at
first
a
variety
of
japanese
nut
who
aped
the
european
and
the
american
in
his
habits
manners
and
dress
of
which
pose
the
high
collar
was
the
most
visible
symbol
the
word
was
presumably
contemptuous
in
its
origin
it
has
since
however
changed
its
character
as
so
to
mean
anything
smart
and
fashionable
you
can
live
in
a
house
you
can
read
books
you
can
wear
a
hat
it
has
become
indeed
practically
a
japanese
equivalent
for
that
untranslatable
expression
asako
harrington
like
all
simple
people
had
little
familiarity
save
with
the
superficial
stratum
of
her
intelligence
she
lived
in
the
gladness
of
her
eyes
like
a
happy
young
animal
nothing
not
even
her
marriage
had
touched
her
very
profoundly
even
the
sudden
shock
of
de
brie
had
not
shaken
anything
deeper
than
her
natural
pride
and
her
ignorance
of
mankind
but
in
this
strange
still
land
whose
expression
looks
inwards
and
whose
face
is
a
mask
a
change
was
operating
ito
left
her
as
he
had
intended
with
a
growing
sense
of
her
own
importance
as
distinct
from
her
husband
i
was
your
father
friend
we
were
at
school
together
here
in
tokyo
why
geoffrey
did
not
even
know
her
father
name
asako
did
not
think
as
closely
as
this
she
could
not
but
she
must
have
looked
very
thoughtful
for
when
geoffrey
came
in
he
saw
her
still
sitting
in
the
lounge
and
exclaimed
why
my
little
yum
yum
how
serious
we
are
we
look
as
if
we
were
at
our
own
funeral
could
you
get
the
things
you
wanted
oh
yes
said
asako
trying
to
brighten
up
and
i
had
a
visitor
guess
relations
no
and
yes
it
was
ito
the
lawyer
oh
that
little
blighter
that
reminds
me
i
must
go
and
see
him
and
find
out
what
he
is
doing
with
our
money
money
laughed
asako
tanaka
never
lets
me
forget
that
of
course
little
one
said
geoffrey
i
be
in
the
workhouse
if
it
was
for
you
geoffrey
darling
said
his
wife
hesitating
will
you
give
me
something
yes
of
course
my
sweetheart
what
do
you
want
i
want
a
yes
please
and
i
like
to
have
a
of
my
own
sometimes
when
i
am
out
by
myself
i
would
like
why
of
course
said
geoffrey
you
ought
to
have
had
one
long
ago
but
it
was
your
own
idea
you
did
want
to
be
bothered
with
money
oh
geoffrey
you
angel
you
are
so
good
to
me
she
clung
to
his
neck
and
he
seeing
the
hotel
deserted
and
nobody
about
raised
her
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
bodily
upstairs
to
the
interest
and
amusement
of
the
chorus
of
who
had
just
been
discussing
why
had
left
for
so
many
hours
that
afternoon
and
who
and
what
was
the
japanese
gentleman
who
had
been
talking
to
in
the
hall
chapter
x
the
yoshiwara
women
no
ume
kimi
ga
tame
ni
hiraku
hana
no
shingi

shiran

tsuki
wo
funde
the
finest
of
kyushu
this
night
is
opening
for
thee
if
thou
wishes
to
know
the
true
character
of
this
flower
come
at
the
third
hour
singing
in
the
moonlight
popular
as
the
result
of
an
affecting
scene
with
his
wife
opposition
to
the
yoshiwara
project
collapsed
if
everybody
went
to
see
the
place
then
it
could
not
be
such
very
bad
form
to
do
so
asako
rang
up
reggie
and
on
the
next
afternoon
the
young
diplomat
called
for
the
barringtons
in
a
where
miss
yaé
smith
was
already
installed
they
drove
through
tokyo
it
was
like
crossing
london
for
the
space
of
distance
covered
an
immense
city
yet
is
it
a
city
or
merely
a
village
preposterously
overgrown
there
is
no
dignity
in
the
japanese
capital
nothing
secular
or
permanent
except
that
mysterious
in
the
midst
of
the
moats
and
the
grey
walls
where
dwell
the
emperor
and
the
spirit
of
the
race
it
is
a
mongrel
city
a
vast
congeries
of
native
wooden
huts
hastily
equipped
with
a
few
modern
conveniences
drunken
poles
stagger
down
the
streets
waving
their
cobwebs
of
electric
wires
rickety
trams
jolt
past
crowded
to
overflowing
so
crowded
that
humanity
clings
to
the
steps
and
platforms
in
clots
like
flies
clinging
to
some
sweet
surface
thousands
of
little
shops
glitter
wink
or
frown
at
the
many
of
them
have
western
windows
and
stucco
fronts
hiding
their
savagery
like
a
native
woman
tricked
out
in
ridiculous
pomp
some
still
grimly
conservative
receive
the
customer
in
their
cavernous
interior
and
cheat
his
eyes
in
their
perpetual
twilight
many
of
these
little
shops
are
so
small
that
their
flows
over
on
to
the
pavement
the
toy
shops
the
china
shops
the
cake
shops
the
shops
for
women
ribbons
and
hairpins
seem
to
be
trying
to
turn
themselves
inside
out
others
are
so
reticent
that
nothing
appears
save
a
stretch
of
clean
straw
mats
where
sulky
clerks
sit
smoking
round
the
fireboxes
then
when
the
eye
gets
accustomed
to
the
darkness
one
can
see
behind
them
the
ranks
of
the
of
uji
or
layers
of
dark
kimono
stuff
the
character
of
the
shops
changed
as
the
barringtons
and
their
party
approached
their
destination
the
native
element
predominated
more
and
more
the
wares
became
more
and
more
inexplicable
there
were
shops
in
which
gold
buddhas
shone
and
brass
lamps
for
temple
use
shops
displaying
queer
utensils
and
mysterious
little
bits
of
things
whose
secret
was
hidden
in
the
cabalistic
signs
of
chinese
script
there
were
stalls
of
curios
and
goods
spread
out
on
the
pavement
under
the
custody
of
wizened
inattentive
old
men
who
squatted
and
smoked
maids
stared
at
the
foreigners
from
the
balconies
of
lofty
inns
and
near
uyeno
station
further
on
they
passed
the
silence
of
old
temple
walls
the
spaciousness
of
cloisters
and
the
huge
roofs
of
the
shrines
with
their
twisted
points
then
down
a
narrow
alley
appeared
the
garish
banners
of
the
asakusa
theatres
and
cinema
palaces
they
heard
the
yelling
of
the
and
the
bray
of
discordant
music
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
hideous
placards
whose
crude
illustrations
showed
the
quality
of
the
performance
to
be
seen
within
girls
falling
from
aeroplanes
demon
ghosts
with
bloody
daggers
melodrama
unleashed
everywhere
the
same
crowds
loitered
along
the
pavements
no
hustle
no
appearance
of
business
save
where
a
threaded
the
maze
on
a
bicycle
or
where
a
coolie
pulled
at
an
overloaded
barrow
grey
and
brown
the
crowd
clattered
by
on
their
wooden
shoes
grey
and
black
passed
the
young
men
with
their
yellow
shoes
black
and
the
policeman
went
to
and
fro
invisibly
moored
to
his
wooden
the
only
bright
notes
among
all
these
drab
multitudes
were
the
little
girls
in
their
variegated
kimonos
who
fluttered
in
and
out
of
the
entrances
and
who
played
unscolded
on
the
footpaths
these
too
were
the
only
notes
of
happiness
for
their
relatives
especially
the
women
carried
an
air
if
not
an
actual
expression
of
animal
melancholy
the
melancholy
of
driven
sheep
or
of
cows
ruminant
the
crowds
were
growing
denser
their
faces
were
all
set
in
one
direction
at
last
the
whole
roadway
was
filled
with
the
tide
the
harringtons
and
their
friends
had
to
alight
from
their
car
and
continue
the
rest
of
the
way
on
foot
they
are
all
going
to
see
the
show
reggie
explained
to
his
party
and
he
pointed
to
a
line
of
high
houses
which
stood
out
above
the
low
native
huts
it
was
a
square
block
of
building
some
hundreds
of
yards
long
quite
foreign
in
character
having
the
appearance
of
factory
buildings
or
of
a
barracks
or
workhouse
what
a
place
said
asako
yes
agreed
reggie
but
at
night
it
is
much
brighter
it
is
all
lit
up
from
top
to
bottom
it
is
called
the
nightless
city
what
bad
faces
these
people
have
said
asako
who
was
romantically
set
on
seeing
evil
everywhere
is
it
quite
safe
oh
yes
said
their
guide
japanese
crowds
are
very
orderly
indeed
they
suffered
no
inconvenience
from
the
crowd
beyond
much
staring
an
ordeal
which
awaits
the
foreigner
in
all
corners
of
tokyo
they
had
reached
a
very
narrow
street
where
raffish
were
doing
a
roaring
trade
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
dirty
tablecloths
and
powdered
waitresses
wearing
skirts
aprons
and
lumpy
shoes
all
very
on
the
right
hand
they
passed
a
little
temple
from
whose
exiguous
courtyard
two
stone
foxes
grinned
maliciously
the
temple
of
the
god
inari
who
brings
rich
lovers
to
the
girls
who
pray
to
him
they
passed
through
iron
gates
like
the
gates
of
a
park
where
two
policemen
were
posted
to
regulate
the
traffic
beyond
was
a
single
line
of
in
full
bloom
a
single
wave
of
pinkish
spray
a
hanging
curtain
of
vapourous
beauty
the
subject
of
a
thousand
poems
of
a
thousand
allusions
licentious
delicate
and
trite
the
of
the
yoshiwara
at
a
street
corner
stood
a
high
white
building
plastered
with
golden
letters
in
japanese
and
english
asahi
beer
hall
that
is
the
place
said
yaé
let
us
get
out
of
this
crowd
they
found
refuge
among
more
dirty
tablecloths
europeanised
and
gaping
guests
when
yaé
spoke
to
the
girls
in
japanese
there
was
much
bowing
and
hissing
of
the
breath
and
they
were
invited
upstairs
on
to
the
first
floor
where
was
another
slightly
more
than
the
downstair
gambrinus
here
a
table
and
chairs
were
set
for
them
in
the
embrasure
of
a
which
protruding
over
the
commanded
an
admirable
view
of
the
converging
streets
the
procession
wo
be
here
for
two
hours
more
said
yaé
pouting
her
displeasure
one
always
has
to
wait
in
japan
said
reggie
nobody
ever
knows
exactly
when
anything
is
going
to
happen
and
so
the
japanese
just
wait
and
wait
they
seem
to
like
it
rather
anyhow
they
do
get
impatient
life
is
so
uneventful
here
that
i
think
they
must
like
prolonging
an
incident
as
much
as
possible
like
sucking
a
sweet
slowly
meanwhile
there
was
plenty
to
look
at
asako
could
not
get
over
her
shock
at
the
sea
of
wicked
faces
which
surged
below
what
class
of
people
are
these
geoffrey
asked
oh
i
think
most
of
them
said
yaé
and
people
who
work
in
factories
good
class
japanese
do
come
here
then
geoffrey
asked
again
oh
no
only
low
class
people
and
students
japanese
people
say
it
is
a
shameful
thing
to
go
to
the
yoshiwara
and
if
they
go
they
go
very
secretly
do
you
know
any
one
who
goes
asked
reggie
with
a
directness
which
shocked
his
friend
sense
of
good
form
oh
my
brothers
said
yaé
but
they
go
everywhere
or
they
say
they
do
it
certainly
was
an
crowd
the
japanese
are
not
an
ugly
race
the
young
aristocrat
who
has
grown
up
with
fresh
air
and
healthy
exercise
is
often
and
sometimes
distinguished
and
refined
but
the
lower
classes
those
who
keep
company
with
poverty
dirt
and
pawnshops
with
the
pleasures
of
the
barrel
and
the
yoshiwara
are
the
ugliest
beings
that
were
ever
created
in
the
image
of
their
misshapen
gods
their
small
stature
and
attitudes
the
colour
and
discolour
of
their
skin
the
flat
mongolian
nose
their
gaping
mouths
and
bad
teeth
the
coarse
fibre
of
their
lustreless
black
hair
give
them
an
elvish
and
a
goblin
look
as
though
this
country
were
a
nursery
for
fairy
changelings
a
land
of
the
nibelungen
where
bad
thoughts
have
found
their
incarnation
yet
the
faces
have
not
got
that
character
for
good
and
evil
as
we
find
them
among
the
aryan
peoples
the
deep
lines
and
the
firm
profiles
it
is
the
absence
of
something
rather
than
its
presence
which
appals
and
depresses
us
reggie
forsyth
observed
an
absence
of
happiness
perhaps
or
of
a
promise
of
happiness
the
crowd
which
filled
the
four
roads
with
its
slow
grey
tide
was
peaceable
enough
and
it
was
strangely
silent
the
drag
and
clatter
of
the
clogs
made
more
sound
than
the
human
voices
the
great
majority
were
men
though
there
were
women
among
them
quiet
and
demure
if
ever
a
voice
was
lifted
one
could
see
by
the
rolling
walk
and
the
fatuous
smile
that
its
owner
had
been
drinking
such
a
person
would
be
removed
out
of
sight
by
his
friends
the
japanese
generally
go
and
in
friendships
and
companies
and
the
which
in
japan
is
called
the
flourishes
here
as
in
germany
two
coolies
started
quarreling
under
the
barringtons
window
they
too
had
been
drinking
they
did
not
hit
out
at
each
other
like
englishmen
but
started
an
interchange
of
abuse
in
gruff
monosyllables
and
indistinguishable
grunts
and
snorts
chikushomé
fool
beast
dung
these
amenities
exasperating
their
ill
humour
they
began
to
pull
at
each
other
coats
and
to
jostle
each
other
like
quarrelsome
curs
this
was
a
sign
that
affairs
were
growing
serious
and
the
police
intervened
again
each
combatant
was
pushed
away
by
his
companions
into
opposite
byways
with
these
exceptions
all
tramplings
squeezings
pushings
and
pokings
were
received
with
conventional
grins
or
apathetic
staring
yet
in
the
paper
next
day
it
was
said
that
so
great
had
been
the
crowd
that
six
deaths
had
occurred
and
numerous
persons
had
fainted
but
where
is
the
yoshiwara
geoffrey
asked
at
last
where
are
these
wretched
women
kept
reggie
waved
his
hand
in
the
direction
of
the
three
roads
facing
them
inside
the
iron
gates
that
is
all
the
yoshiwara
and
those
high
houses
and
the
low
ones
too
that
is
where
the
girls
are
there
are
two
or
three
thousand
of
them
within
sight
as
it
were
from
here
but
of
course
the
night
time
is
the
time
to
see
them
i
suppose
so
said
geoffrey
vaguely
they
sit
in
shop
windows
one
might
say
reggie
went
on
only
with
bars
in
front
like
cages
in
the
zoo
and
they
wear
gorgeous
kimonos
red
and
gold
and
blue
and
embroidered
with
flowers
and
dragons
it
is
like
nothing
i
can
think
of
except
aviaries
full
of
wonderful
parrakeets
and
are
they
pretty
asako
asked
no
i
ca
say
they
are
pretty
and
they
all
seem
very
much
alike
to
the
mere
westerner
i
ca
imagine
any
body
picking
out
one
of
them
and
saying
love
her
is
the
loveliest
there
is
a
fat
impassive
type
like
buddha
there
is
a
foxy
animated
type
which
exchanges
with
the
young
nuts
through
the
bars
of
her
cage
and
there
is
a
merely
ugly
lumpy
type
a
kind
of
cloddish
who
exists
in
all
countries
but
the
more
exclusive
houses
display
their
women
one
can
only
see
a
row
of
photographs
no
doubt
they
are
very
flattering
to
their
originals
asako
was
staring
at
the
buildings
now
at
the
high
square
prison
houses
and
at
the
low
native
roofs
these
had
each
its
little
platform
its
where
much
white
washing
was
drying
in
the
sun
at
the
farther
end
of
one
street
a
large
stucco
building
with
a
grecian
portico
stood
athwart
the
thoroughfare
what
is
that
said
asako
it
looks
like
a
church
that
is
the
hospital
answered
reggie
but
why
is
there
a
hospital
here
she
asked
again
yaé
smith
smiled
ever
so
little
at
her
new
friend
ignorance
of
the
wages
of
sin
but
nobody
answered
the
question
there
was
a
movement
in
the
crowd
a
pushing
back
from
some
unseen
locality
like
the
jolting
of
railway
trucks
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
craning
of
necks
and
a
murmur
of
interest
in
the
street
opposite
the
crowd
was
opening
down
the
centre
the
police
who
had
sprung
up
everywhere
like
the
crop
of
the
teeth
were
dividing
the
people
and
then
down
the
path
so
formed
came
the
strangest
procession
which
geoffrey
barrington
had
ever
seen
on
or
off
the
stage
high
above
the
heads
of
the
crowd
appeared
what
seemed
to
be
a
automaton
a
moving
waxwork
magnificently
garbed
in
white
brocade
with
red
and
gold
embroidery
of
phenixes
and
a
huge
red
sash
tied
in
a
bow
in
front
the
hem
of
the
skirt
turned
up
with
red
and
thickly
wadded
revealed
a
series
of
these
garments
fitting
beneath
each
other
like
the
leaves
of
an
artichoke
under
a
monumental
edifice
of
hair
bristling
like
a
hedgehog
with
pins
and
with
silver
spangles
and
rosettes
a
blank
impassive
little
face
was
staring
straight
in
front
of
it
utterly
expressionless
utterly
unnatural
hidden
beneath
the
glaze
of
enamel
the
china
face
of
a
doll
it
parted
the
grey
multitude
like
a
pillar
of
light
it
tottered
forward
slowly
for
it
was
lifted
above
the
crowd
on
a
pair
of
clogs
as
high
as
stilts
dangerous
and
difficult
to
manipulate
on
each
side
were
two
little
figures
similarly
painted
similarly
bedizened
similarly
expressionless
children
of
nine
or
ten
years
only
the
the
little
they
served
to
support
the
reigning
beauty
and
at
the
same
time
to
display
her
long
embroidered
sleeves
outstretched
on
either
side
like
wings
the
brilliant
figure
and
her
two
attendants
moved
forward
under
the
shade
of
a
huge
ceremonial
umbrella
of
yellow
oiled
paper
which
looked
like
a
membrane
or
like
old
vellum
and
upon
which
were
written
in
chinese
characters
the
personal
name
of
the
lady
chosen
for
the
honour
and
the
name
of
the
house
in
which
she
was
an
inmate
the
shaft
of
this
umbrella
some
eight
or
nine
feet
long
was
carried
by
a
sinister
being
clothed
in
the
blue
livery
of
the
japanese
artisan
a
kind
of
tabard
with
trousers
he
kept
twisting
the
all
the
time
with
a
gyrating
movement
to
and
fro
which
imparted
to
the
disc
of
the
umbrella
the
hesitation
of
a
wave
he
followed
the
queen
with
a
strange
slow
stride
for
long
seconds
he
would
pause
with
one
foot
held
aloft
in
the
attitude
of
a
horse
which
distorted
his
dwarfish
body
into
a
diabolic
convulsion
like
durer
angel
of
horror
he
seemed
a
familiar
spirit
a
mocking
devil
the
wicked
of
the
miracle
play
whose
harsh
laughter
echoes
through
the
empty
room
when
the
last
cup
is
emptied
the
last
shilling
gone
and
the
dreamer
awakes
from
his
dream
behind
him
followed
five
or
six
men
carrying
large
oval
lanterns
also
inscribed
with
the
name
of
the
house
and
after
them
came
a
representative
collection
of
the
officials
of
the
proud
establishment
a
few
foxy
old
women
and
a
crowd
of
swaggering
men
spotty
and
the
chief
courtesan
reached
the
there
as
if
moved
by
machinery
or
magnetism
she
slowly
turned
to
the
left
she
made
her
way
towards
one
of
a
row
of
small
native
houses
on
the
road
down
which
the
barringtons
had
come
here
the
umbrella
was
lowered
the
beauty
bowed
her
monumental
head
to
pass
under
the
low
doorway
and
settled
herself
on
a
pile
of
cushions
prepared
to
receive
her
almost
at
once
the
popular
interest
was
diverted
to
the
appearance
of
another
procession
precisely
similar
which
was
debouching
from
the
opposite
road
the
new
garbed
in
blue
with
a
sash
of
gold
and
a
design
of
supported
by
her
two
little
attendants
wobbled
towards
another
of
the
little
houses
on
her
disappearing
a
third
procession
came
into
sight
ah
sighed
asako
what
lovely
kimonos
where
do
they
get
them
from
i
do
know
said
yaé
some
of
them
are
quite
old
they
come
out
fresh
year
after
year
for
a
different
girl
yaé
with
her
distorted
little
soul
was
thinking
that
it
must
be
worth
the
years
of
slavery
and
the
humiliation
of
disease
to
have
that
one
day
of
complete
triumph
to
be
the
representative
of
beauty
upon
earth
to
feel
the
admiration
and
the
desire
of
that
vast
concourse
of
men
rising
round
one
body
like
a
warm
flood
geoffrey
stared
fascinated
wondering
to
see
the
fact
of
prostitution
advertised
so
unblushingly
as
a
public
spectacle
his
hatred
and
contempt
breaking
over
the
heads
of
the
men
who
followed
the
harlot
and
picked
their
livelihood
out
of
her
shame
reggie
was
wondering
what
might
be
the
thoughts
of
those
little
creatures
muffled
in
such
splendour
that
their
personality
like
that
of
infant
queens
was
entirely
hidden
by
the
significance
of
what
they
symbolized
not
a
smile
not
a
glance
of
recognition
passed
over
the
unnatural
whiteness
of
their
faces
yet
they
could
not
be
as
they
appeared
to
be
were
they
proud
to
wear
such
finery
were
they
happy
to
be
so
acclaimed
did
their
heart
beat
for
one
man
or
did
their
vanity
drink
in
the
homage
of
all
did
their
mind
turn
back
to
the
mortgaged
farm
and
the
work
in
the
to
the
thriftless
shop
and
the
chatter
of
the
little
town
to
the
father
who
had
sold
them
in
the
days
of
their
innocence
to
the
first
numbing
shock
of
that
new
life
perhaps
or
perhaps
they
were
too
taken
up
with
maintaining
their
equilibrium
on
their
high
shoes
or
perhaps
they
thought
of
nothing
at
all
reggie
who
had
a
poor
opinion
of
the
intellectual
brightness
of
uneducated
japanese
women
thought
that
the
last
alternative
was
highly
probable
i
wonder
what
those
little
houses
are
where
they
pay
their
visits
reggie
said
oh
those
are
the
said
yaé
glibly
the
yoshiwara
do
they
live
there
asked
asako
oh
no
rich
men
who
come
to
the
yoshiwara
do
not
go
to
the
big
houses
where
the
live
they
go
to
the
and
they
order
food
and
to
sing
and
the
to
be
brought
from
the
big
house
it
is
more
private
so
the
are
called
which
lead
by
the
hand
yaé
said
reggie
you
know
a
lot
about
it
yes
said
miss
smith
my
brothers
have
told
me
they
tell
me
lots
of
things
after
a
stay
of
about
half
an
hour
the
left
their
the
processions
reformed
and
they
slowly
tottered
back
to
the
places
whence
they
had
come
across
their
path
the
cherry
petals
were
already
falling
like
snowflakes
for
the
is
the
japanese
symbol
of
the
impermanence
of
earthly
beauty
and
of
all
sweet
things
and
pleasant
by
jove
said
geoffrey
harrington
to
the
world
in
general
that
was
an
extraordinary
sight
east
is
east
and
west
is
west
eh
i
never
felt
that
so
strongly
before
how
often
does
this
performance
take
place
this
performance
said
reggie
has
taken
place
for
three
days
every
spring
for
the
last
three
hundred
years
but
it
is
more
than
doubtful
whether
it
will
ever
happen
again
it
is
called
the
procession
of
the
courtesans
geoffrey
what
you
have
seen
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
the
passing
of
old
japan
but
whom
do
these
women
belong
to
asked
geoffrey
and
who
is
making
money
out
of
all
this
filth
various
people
and
companies
i
suppose
who
own
the
different
houses
answered
reggie
a
fellow
once
offered
to
sell
me
his
whole
establishment
bedding
and
six
girls
for
down
but
he
must
have
been
having
a
run
of
bad
luck
in
most
countries
it
is
a
most
profitable
form
of
investment
do
you
remember
profession
per
cent
i
think
was
the
exact
figure
i
do
suppose
japan
is
any
exception
by
jove
said
geoffrey
the
women
poor
wretches
they
ca
help
themselves
and
the
men
who
buy
what
they
sell
one
ca
blame
them
either
but
the
creatures
who
make
fortunes
out
of
all
this
beastiness
and
cruelty
i
say
they
ought
to
be
flogged
round
the
place
with
a
till
the
life
is
beaten
out
of
them
let
get
away
from
here
as
they
left
the
a
small
round
japanese
man
bobbed
up
from
the
crowd
raised
his
hat
bowed
and
smiled
it
was
tanaka
geoffrey
had
left
him
behind
on
purpose
that
his
servants
at
least
might
not
know
where
he
was
going
i
think
i
meet
ladyship
here
said
the
little
man
but
for
long
time
i
do
not
spy
her
i
am
very
sorry
is
anything
wrong
why
did
you
come
asked
geoffrey
good
never
leave
lordship
side
of
course
i
come
was
the
reply
well
hurry
up
and
get
back
said
his
master
or
we
shall
be
home
before
you
with
renewed
bowings
he
disappeared
asako
was
laughing
we
can
never
get
rid
of
tanaka
she
said
can
we
he
follows
us
like
a
detective
sometimes
i
think
he
is
deliberately
spying
on
us
said
her
husband
cheer
up
said
reggie
they
all
do
that
the
party
dispersed
at
the
imperial
hotel
asako
was
laughing
and
happy
she
had
enjoyed
herself
immensely
as
usual
and
her
innocence
had
realized
little
or
nothing
of
the
grim
significance
of
what
she
had
seen
but
geoffrey
was
gloomy
and
distrait
he
had
taken
it
much
to
heart
that
night
he
had
a
horrible
dream
the
procession
of
the
was
passing
once
more
before
his
eyes
but
he
could
not
see
the
face
of
the
gorgeous
doll
whom
all
these
crowds
had
come
out
to
admire
he
felt
strangely
apprehensive
however
then
at
a
corner
of
the
street
the
figure
turned
and
faced
him
it
was
asako
his
wife
he
struggled
to
reach
her
and
save
her
but
the
crowds
of
japanese
closed
in
upon
him
he
struggled

has
at

next
morning
geoffrey
rose
earlier
than
was
his
wont
and
arrayed
in
one
of
his
many
kimonos
entered
his
there
he
found
tanaka
wrapped
in
contemplation
of
a
letter
he
was
scrutinizing
it
with
an
attention
which
seemed
to
pierce
the
envelope
who
is
it
from
tanaka
asked
geoffrey
he
had
become
mildly
ironical
in
his
dealings
with
the
inquisitive

perhaps
invitation
to
pleasure

from

noble
relatives
tanaka
replied
unabashed
geoffrey
took
the
note
to
his
wife
and
she
read
aloud
dear
and

it
is
now
the
bright

i
hope
you
to
enjoy
good
health
i
have
been
rude
thus
to
absent
myself
during
your
polite
visit
much
pressing
business
has
hampered
me
also
stomach

but
indeed
there
is
no
excuse
please
not
to
be

this
time
i

you
to

what
exactly

sweetheart
said
geoffrey
tell
them
that
we
are
not
angry
and
that
we
shall
be
delighted
to

tanaka
explained
that
the
maple
club
restaurant
or
koyokwan
which
more
strictly
should
be
translated
hall
of
the
red
leaf
is
the
largest
and
most
famous
of
tokyo
to
use
a
comprehensive
term
which
applies
equally
to
a
shack
by
the
roadside
and
to
a
dainty
pleasure
resort
where
entertainments
run
easily
into
four
or
five
pounds
per
head
there
are
restaurants
more
secretive
and
more
where
the
aesthetic
may
feel
more
at
ease
and
where
the
bohemian
spirit
can
loose
its
wit
but
for
public
functions
of
all
kinds
for
anything
on
a
really
big
scale
the
maple
club
stands
alone
it
is
the
princes
of
tokyo
with
a
flavour
of
the
guildhall
steaming
richly
through
its
corridors
here
the
great
municipal
dinners
take
place
the
great
political
entertainments
here
famous
foreigners
are
officially
introduced
to
the
mysteries
of
japanese
and
the
charms
of
japanese
here
hangs
a

of

kitchener
himself
scrambled
over

laughing
who
seem
to
be
peeping
out
of
his
pockets
and
buttonholes
a
gulliver
in
lilliput
both
geoffrey
and
asako
had
treated
the
invitation
as
a
joke
but
at
the
last
moment
while
they
were
threading
the
mysterious
streets
of
the
still
unfamiliar
city
they
both
confessed
to
a
certain
nervousness
they
were
on
the
brink
of
a
plunge
into
depths
unknown
they
knew
nothing
whatever
about
the
customs
tastes
and
prejudices
of
the
people
with
whom
they
were
to
mix
not
even
their
names
and
their
language
well
we
in
for
it
said
geoffrey
we
must
see
it
through
now
they
drove
up
a
steep
gravel
drive
and
stopped
before
a
broad
japanese
entrance
three
wide
steps
like
altar
stairs
leading
up
to
a
dark
cavernous
hall
full
of
bowing
women
and
men
in
black
clothes
similar
silent
and
ghostlike
the
first
impression
was
lugubrious
like
a
feast
of
mutes
boots
off
geoffrey
knew
at
least
this
rule
number
one
in
japanese
etiquette
but
who
were
these
fluttering
women
so
attentive
in
removing
their
cloaks
and
hats
were
they
relatives
or
waitresses
and
the
silent
groups
beyond
were
they
fujinami
or
waiters
the
two
guests
had
friendly
smiles
for
all
but
they
gazed
helplessly
for
a
familiar
face
an
apparition
in
evening
dress
with
a
long
frock
coat
and
a
purple
tie
emerged
from
that
grim
chorus
of
spectators
it
was
ito
the
lawyer
the
free
and
easy
american
manner
was
checked
by
the
responsibility
of
those
flapping
he
looked
and
behaved
just
like
a
after
a
stiff
bow
and
handshake
he
said
very
pleased
to
see
you
sir
and
barrington
also
the
fujinami
family
is
proud
to
make
your
entertainment
geoffrey
expected
further
introductions
but
the
time
had
not
yet
come
with
a
wave
of
the
arm
ito
added
please
step
this
way
sir
and
lady
the
barringtons
with
ito
led
the
procession
and
the
mutes
closed
in
behind
them
down
endless
polished
corridors
they
passed
with
noiseless
steps
over
the
spotless
boards
the
only
sound
was
the
rustling
of
silk
garments
to
closed
eyes
they
might
have
seemed
like
the
arrival
of
a
company
of
dowagers
the
women
who
had
at
first
received
them
were
still
fluttering
around
them
like
escorting
a
flight
of
crows
to
one
of
them
geoffrey
owed
his
preservation
he
would
have
struck
his
forehead
against
a
low
doorway
in
the
darkness
but
she
touched
the
lintel
with
her
finger
and
then
laid
her
tiny
hand
on
barrington
tall
shoulder
laughing
and
saying
in
infantile
english
english
very
high
they
came
to
a
sudden
opening
between
paper
walls
in
a
little
room
behind
a
table
stood
a
japanese
couple
as
stiff
as
waxworks
for
an
instant
geoffrey
thought
they
must
be
the
cloakroom
attendants
then
to
his
surprise
ito
announced
and
fujinami
gentaro
the
head
of
the
fujinami
family
please
walk
in
and
shake
hands
geoffrey
and
his
wife
did
as
they
were
directed
three
mutual
bowings
took
place
in
absolute
silence
followed
by
a
handshake
then
ito
said
and
fujinami
gentaro
wish
to
say
they
are
very
pleased
you
both
come
it
is
very
poor
food
and
very
poor
feast
they
say
japanese
food
is
very
simple
sort
of
thing
but
they
ask
you
please
excuse
them
for
what
they
have
done
they
have
done
from
a
good
heart
geoffrey
was
mumbling
incoherently
and
wondering
whether
he
was
expected
to
reply
to
this
oration
when
ito
again
exclaimed
please
step
this
way
they
passed
into
a
large
room
like
a
concert
hall
with
a
stage
at
one
end
there
were
several
men
squatting
on
the
floor
round
smoking
and
drinking
beer
they
looked
like
black
sheep
browsing
these
were
joined
by
the
mutes
who
followed
the
barringtons
all
of
these
people
were
dressed
exactly
alike
they
wore
white
socks
a
dark
kimono
almost
hidden
by
the
black
cloak
upon
which
the
family
crest
a
wreath
of
wisteria
foliage
shone
like
a
star
on
sleeves
and
neck
and
by
the
fluted
yellowish
skirt
of
heavy
rustling
silk
this
dress
though
gloomy
and
sacerdotal
was
dignified
and
becoming
but
the
similarity
was
absurd
it
looked
like
a
studied
effect
at
a
fancy
dress
ball
it
was
particularly
exasperating
to
the
guests
of
honour
who
were
anxious
to
distinguish
their
relatives
and
to
know
them
apart
but
ito
alone
with
his
european
clothes
and
his
purple
tie
was
conspicuous
and
unmistakable
he
is
like
jarley
thought
geoffrey
he
explains
the
waxworks
in
the
middle
of
the
room
was
a
little
group
of
chairs
of
the
weary
beast
of
burden
type
which
are
requisitioned
for
public
meetings
two
of
them
were
dignified
by
cushions
of
crimson
plush
these
were
for
geoffrey
and
asako
among
the
black
sheep
there
was
no
movement
beyond
the
steady
staring
of
some
thirty
pairs
of
eyes
when
the
harringtons
had
been
enthroned
the
host
and
hostess
approached
them
with
silent
dragging
steps
and
downcast
faces
they
might
have
been
the
bearers
of
evil
tidings
a
tall
girl
followed
behind
her
parents
fujinami
shidzuyé
and
her
daughter
sadako
were
the
only
women
present
this
was
a
compromise
and
a
consideration
for
feelings
ito
had
proposed
that
since
a
lady
was
the
chief
guest
of
honour
therefore
all
the
fujinami
ladies
ought
to
be
invited
to
meet
her
to
fujinami
strict
conservative
mind
such
an
idea
was
anathema
what
wives
at
a
banquet
in
a
public
restaurant
with
present
absurd
and
disgusting
tempora
o
then
argued
the
lawyer
asako
must
not
be
invited
but
asako
was
the
of
the
evening
and
besides
an
english
gentleman
would
be
insulted
if
his
wife
were
not
invited
too
and
as
ito
went
on
to
urge
any
woman
japanese
or
foreign
would
be
in
a
company
composed
entirely
of
men
besides
sadako
could
speak
english
so
well
it
was
so
convenient
that
she
should
come
and
under
her
mother
care
her
morals
would
not
be
contaminated
by
the
propinquity
of
so
fujinami
gave
in
so
far
as
concerned
his
own
wife
and
daughter
shidzuyé
san
as
befitted
a
matron
of
sober
years
wore
a
plain
black
kimono
but
sadako
dress
was
of
pale
mauve
color
with
a
bronze
sash
tied
in
an
enormous
bow
her
hair
was
parted
on
one
side
and
caught
up
in
a
bun
behind
the
latest
fashion
and
a
tribute
to
the
foreign
guests
hers
was
a
graceful
figure
but
her
expression
was
spoiled
by
the
spectacles
which
completely
hid
her
features
miss
sadako
fujinami
daughter
of
fujinami
gentaro
said
ito
she
has
been
university
undergraduate
and
she
speaks
english
quite
well
miss
sadako
bowed
three
times
then
she
said
how
do
you
do
in
a
high
unnatural
voice
the
room
was
filling
up
with
the
little
women
who
had
been
present
at
the
entrance
they
were
handing
cigarettes
and
tea
cups
to
the
guests
they
looked
bright
and
pleasant
and
they
interested
geoffrey
are
these
ladies
relatives
of
the
fujinami
family
he
asked
ito
oh
no
not
at
all
the
lawyer
gasped
you
have
made
great
mistake
barrington
japanese
ladies
all
left
at
home
never
go
to
restaurant
these
girls
are
no
ladies
they
girls
girls
very
famous
to
foreign
persons
geoffrey
knew
that
he
had
made
his
first
now
said
ito
please
step
this
way
we
go
upstairs
to
the
feast
room
the
seemed
larger
still
than
the
reception
room
down
each
side
of
it
were
arranged
two
rows
of
red
lacquer
tables
each
about
eighteen
inches
high
and
eighteen
inches
square
mysterious
little
dishes
were
placed
on
each
side
of
these
tables
the
most
conspicuous
was
a
flat
reddish
fish
with
a
large
eye
artistically
served
in
a
rollicking
attitude
which
in
itself
was
an
invitation
to
eat
the
english
guests
were
escorted
to
two
seats
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
room
where
two
tables
were
laid
in
isolated
glory
they
were
to
sit
there
like
king
and
queen
with
two
rows
of
their
subjects
in
long
aisles
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
of
them
the
seats
were
cushions
merely
but
those
placed
for
geoffrey
and
asako
were
raised
on
low
hassocks
after
them
the
files
of
the
fujinami
streamed
in
and
took
up
their
appointed
positions
along
the
sides
of
the
room
they
were
followed
by
the
each
girl
carrying
a
little
white
china
bottle
shaped
like
a
vegetable
marrow
and
a
tiny
cup
like
the
bath
which
hygienic
old
maids
provide
for
their
canary
birds
japanese
said
sadako
to
her
cousin
you
do
not
like
oh
yes
i
do
replied
asako
who
was
intent
on
enjoying
everything
but
on
this
occasion
she
had
chosen
the
wrong
answer
for
real
ladies
in
japan
are
not
supposed
to
drink
the
warm
rice
wine
the
certainly
looked
most
charming
as
they
slowly
advanced
in
a
kind
of
ritualistic
procession
their
feet
like
little
white
mice
the
dragging
skirts
of
their
spotless
kimonos
their
exaggerated
care
and
precision
and
their
stiff
conventional
attitudes
presented
a
picture
from
a
satsuma
vase
their
dresses
were
of
all
shades
black
blue
purple
grey
and
mauve
the
corner
of
the
skirt
folded
back
above
the
instep
revealed
a
glimpse
of
gaudy
underwear
provoking
to
men
eyes
and
displayed
the
intricate
stenciled
flower
patterns
which
in
the
case
of
the
younger
women
seemed
to
be
catching
hold
of
the
long
sleeves
and
straying
upwards
little
dancing
girls
thirteen
and
fourteen
years
old
the
or
half
jewels
accompanied
their
elder
sisters
of
the
profession
they
wore
very
bright
dresses
just
like
the
dolls
and
their
massive
was
bedizened
with
silver
spangles
and
elaborately
artificial
flowers
oh
gasped
the
admiring
asako
i
must
get
one
of
those
girls
to
show
me
how
to
wear
my
kimonos
properly
they
do
look
smart
i
do
not
think
answered
sadako
these
are
vulgar
women
bad
style
i
will
teach
you
the
noble
way
but
all
the
had
a
grave
and
dignified
look
quite
different
from
the
sprightly
butterflies
of
musical
comedy
from
whom
geoffrey
had
accepted
his
knowledge
of
japan
they
knelt
down
before
the
guests
and
poured
a
little
of
the
into
the
shallow
saucer
held
out
for
their
ministrations
then
they
folded
their
hands
in
their
laps
and
appeared
to
slumber
a
sucking
sound
ran
round
the
room
as
the
first
cup
was
drained
then
a
complete
silence
fell
broken
only
by
the
shuffle
of
the
girls
feet
on
the
matting
as
they
went
to
fetch
more
bottles
fujinami
gentaro
spoke
to
the
guests
assembled
bidding
them
commence
their
meal
and
not
to
stand
upon
ceremony
it
is
like
the
one
two
three
go
at
a
race
thought
geoffrey
all
the
guests
were
manipulating
their
geoffrey
raised
his
own
pair
the
two
slender
rods
of
wood
were
unparted
at
one
end
to
show
that
they
had
never
been
used
it
was
therefore
necessary
to
pull
them
in
two
as
he
did
so
a
tiny
splinter
of
wood
like
a
match
fell
from
between
them
asako
laughed
that
is
the
toothpick
cousin
sadako
explained
we
call
such
chopstick
with
baby
because
the
toothpick
inside
the
chopstick
like
the
baby
inside
the
mother
very
funny
i
think
there
were
two
kinds
of
soup
excellent
there
was
cooked
fish
and
raw
fish
in
red
and
white
slices
chastely
served
with
ice
there
were
vegetables
known
and
unknown
such
as
sweet
potatoes
french
beans
lotus
stems
and
bamboo
shoots
these
had
to
be
eaten
with
the
aid
of
the
a
difficult
task
when
it
came
to
cutting
up
the
wing
of
a
chicken
or
balancing
a
soft
poached
egg
the
guests
did
not
eat
with
gusto
they
toyed
with
the
food
sipping
wine
all
the
time
smoking
cigarettes
and
picking
their
teeth
geoffrey
according
to
his
own
description
was
just
getting
his
eye
in
when
fujinami
gentaro
rose
from
his
humble
place
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
in
a
speech
full
of
poetical
quotations
which
must
have
cost
his
tame
students
considerable
trouble
in
the
composition
he
welcomed
asako
barrington
who
he
said
had
been
restored
to
japan
like
a
family
jewel
which
has
been
lost
and
is
found
he
compared
her
visit
to
the
sudden
flowering
of
an
ancient
tree
this
did
not
seem
very
complimentary
however
it
referred
not
to
the
lady
age
but
to
the
elder
branch
of
the
family
which
she
represented
after
many
apologies
for
the
tastelessness
of
the
food
and
the
stupidity
of
the
entertainment
he
proposed
the
health
of
and
harrington
which
was
drunk
by
the
whole
company
standing
ito
produced
from
his
pocket
a
translation
of
this
oration
now
please
say
a
few
words
in
reply
he
directed
geoffrey
feeling
acutely
ridiculous
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
thanked
everybody
for
giving
his
wife
and
himself
such
a
jolly
good
time
ito
translated
now
please
command
to
drink
health
of
the
fujinami
family
said
the
lawyer
consulting
his
so
the
health
of
and
fujinami
gentaro
was
drunk
with
relish
by
everybody
including
the
lady
and
gentleman
honoured
in
this
country
thought
geoffrey
one
gets
the
speechmaking
over
before
the
dinner
not
a
bad
idea
it
saves
that
nervous
feeling
which
spoils
the
appetite
an
old
gentleman
with
a
restless
jaw
tottered
to
his
feet
and
approached
geoffrey
table
he
bowed
twice
before
him
and
held
out
a
hand
fujinami
gennosuké
the
father
of
fujinami
gentaro
announced
ito
he
has
retired
from
life
he
wishes
to
drink
wine
with
you
please
wash
your
cup
and
give
it
to
him
there
was
a
kind
of
standing
in
front
of
geoffrey
which
he
had
imagined
might
be
a
spittoon
he
was
directed
to
rinse
his
cup
in
this
vessel
and
to
hand
it
to
the
old
gentleman
fujinami
gennosuké
received
it
in
both
hands
as
if
it
had
been
a
sacrament
the
attendant
poured
out
a
little
of
the
greenish
liquid
which
was
drunk
with
much
hissing
and
sucking
then
followed
another
obeisance
the
cup
was
returned
and
the
old
gentleman
retired
he
was
succeeded
by
fujinami
gentaro
himself
with
whom
the
same
ceremony
of
the
drinking
was
repeated
and
then
all
the
family
passed
by
one
after
another
each
taking
the
cup
and
drinking
it
was
like
a
visiting
figure
in
the
lancers
quadrille
as
each
relative
bent
and
bowed
ito
announced
his
name
and
quality
these
names
seemed
all
alike
alike
as
their
faces
and
as
their
garments
were
geoffrey
could
only
remember
vaguely
that
he
had
been
introduced
to
a
member
of
parliament
a
gross
man
with
a
terrible
wen
like
an
apple
under
his
ear
and
to
two
army
officers
tall
men
who
pleased
him
more
than
the
others
there
were
several
government
functionaries
but
the
majority
were
business
men
geoffrey
could
only
distinguish
for
certain
his
host
and
his
father
they
look
just
like
two
old
vultures
he
thought
then
there
was
fujinami
takeshi
the
son
of
the
host
and
the
hope
of
the
family
a
livid
youth
with
a
thin
moustache
and
unhealthy
marks
on
his
face
like
raspberries
under
the
skin
still
the
kept
bringing
more
and
more
food
in
a
desultory
way
quite
unlike
our
system
of
fixed
and
regular
courses
still
ito
kept
pressing
geoffrey
to
eat
while
at
the
same
time
apologizing
for
the
quality
of
the
food
with
exasperating
repetition
geoffrey
had
fallen
into
the
error
of
thinking
that
the
fish
and
its
accompanying
dishes
which
had
been
laid
before
him
at
first
comprised
the
whole
of
the
repast
he
had
polished
them
off
with
gusto
and
had
then
discovered
to
his
alarm
that
they
were
merely
nor
did
he
observe
until
too
late
how
little
the
other
guests
were
eating
there
was
no
discourtesy
apparently
in
leaving
the
whole
of
a
dish
untasted
or
in
merely
picking
at
it
from
time
to
time
rudeness
consisted
in
refusing
any
dish
plates
of
broiled
meat
and
sandwiches
arrived
bowls
of
soup
grilled
eels
on
skewers
that
most
famous
of
tokyo
delicacies
finally
the
inevitable
rice
with
whose
adhesive
substance
the
japanese
epicure
fills
up
the
final
crannies
in
his
stomach
it
made
its
appearance
in
a
round
tub
of
clean
white
wood
as
big
as
a
bandbox
and
bound
round
with
shining
brass
the
girls
served
the
sticky
grains
into
the
china
with
a
flat
wooden
ladle
japanese
people
always
take
two
bowls
of
rice
at
least
observed
ito
one
bowl
very
unlucky
at
the
funeral
we
only
eat
one
bowl
this
to
geoffrey
was
the
de
he
had
only
managed
to
stuff
down
his
bowl
through
a
desperate
sense
of
duty
if
i
do
have
a
second
he
gasped
it
will
be
my
own
funeral
but
this
joke
did
not
run
in
the
lines
of
japanese
humour
ito
merely
thought
that
the
big
englishman
having
drunk
much
was
talking
nonsense
all
the
guests
were
beginning
to
circulate
now
the
quadrille
was
becoming
more
and
more
elaborate
they
were
each
calling
on
each
other
and
taking
wine
the
talk
was
becoming
more
animated
a
few
bold
spirits
began
to
laugh
and
joke
with
the
some
had
laid
aside
their
cloaks
and
some
even
had
loosened
their
kimonos
at
the
neck
displaying
hairy
chests
the
stiff
symmetry
of
the
dinner
party
was
quite
broken
up
the
guests
were
scattered
like
rooks
bobbing
scratching
and
pecking
about
on
the
yellow
mats
the
bright
plumage
of
the
stood
out
against
their
sombre
monotony
presently
the
began
to
dance
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
ten
of
the
little
girls
did
their
steps
a
slow
dance
full
of
posturing
with
coloured
handkerchiefs
three
of
the
elder
in
plain
grey
kimonos
squatted
behind
the
dancers
strumming
on
their
but
there
was
very
little
music
either
in
the
instrument
or
in
the
melody
the
sound
of
the
string
twang
and
the
rattle
of
the
bone
plectrum
drowned
the
sweetness
of
the
note
the
result
was
a
kind
of
dry
clatter
or
cackle
which
is
ingenious
but
not
pleasing
reggie
forsyth
used
to
say
that
there
is
no
melody
in
japanese
music
but
that
the
rhythm
is
marvelous
it
is
a
kind
of
elaborate
ragtime
without
any
tune
to
it
the
guests
did
not
pay
any
attention
to
the
performance
nor
did
they
applaud
when
it
was
over
ito
was
consulting
his
paper
and
his
gold
watch
you
will
now
drink
with
these
gentlemen
he
said
geoffrey
must
have
demurred
it
is
japanese
custom
he
continued
please
step
this
way
i
will
guide
you
poor
geoffrey
it
was
his
turn
now
to
do
the
visiting
figure
but
his
head
was
buzzing
with
some
thirty
cups
of
which
he
had
swallowed
out
of
politeness
and
with
the
unreality
of
the
whole
scene
ca
do
it
he
protested
drunk
too
much
already
in
japan
we
say
friends
meet
the
sellers
laugh
quoted
the
lawyer
it
is
japanese
custom
to
drink
together
and
to
be
happy
to
be
drunk
in
good
company
it
is
no
shame
many
of
these
gentlemen
will
presently
be
drunk
but
if
you
do
not
wish
to
drink
more
then
just
pretend
to
drink
you
take
the
cup
see
you
lift
it
to
your
mouth
but
you
throw
away
the
into
the
basin
when
you
wash
the
cup
that
is
trick
when
the
boys
try
to
make
her
drunk
but
she
is
too
wise
armed
with
this
advice
geoffrey
started
on
his
round
of
visits
first
to
his
host
and
then
to
his
host
father
the
face
of
old
fujinami
gennosuké
was
as
red
as
and
his
jaw
was
chewing
more
vigorously
than
ever
nothing
however
could
have
been
more
perfect
than
his
deportment
in
exchanging
the
cup
with
his
guest
but
no
sooner
had
geoffrey
turned
away
to
pay
another
visit
than
he
became
aware
of
a
slight
commotion
he
glanced
round
and
saw
fujinami
senior
in
a
state
of
absolute
collapse
being
conducted
out
of
the
room
by
two
members
of
the
family
and
a
cluster
of
what
has
happened
he
asked
in
some
alarm
it
is
nothing
said
ito
old
gentleman
tipsy
very
quick
everybody
now
seemed
to
be
smiling
and
happy
geoffrey
felt
the
curse
of
his
speechlessness
he
was
brimming
over
with
good
humour
and
was
most
anxious
to
please
the
japanese
no
longer
appeared
so
grotesque
as
they
had
on
his
arrival
he
was
sure
that
he
would
have
much
in
common
with
many
of
these
men
who
talked
so
among
themselves
until
the
chill
of
his
approach
fell
upon
them
besides
ito
and
sadako
fujinami
the
only
person
present
who
could
talk
english
at
all
fluently
was
that
individual
fujinami
takeshi
the
young
man
was
in
a
very
hilarious
state
and
had
gathered
around
him
a
bevy
of
with
whom
he
was
cracking
jokes
from
the
nature
of
his
gestures
they
must
have
been
far
from
decorous
please
to
sit
down
my
dear
friend
he
said
to
geoffrey
do
you
like
girl
i
do
think
they
like
me
said
geoffrey
i
too
big
oh
no
said
the
japanese
very
big
very
good
japanese
man
too
small
no
good
at
all
why
do
all
love
professional
wrestlers
because
very
big
but
this
english
gentleman
bigger
than
so
this
girl
love
you
and
this
girl
and
this
girl
and
this
very
pretty
girl
i
do
know
he
added
a
question
in
japanese
the
giggled
and
hid
her
face
behind
her
sleeve
she
say
she
wish
to
try
first
to
try
the
cake
you
eat
some
is
that
right
he
repeated
his
joke
in
japanese
the
girl
wriggled
with
embarrassment
and
finally
scuttled
away
across
the
room
while
the
others
laughed
all
the
now
hid
their
faces
among
much
tittering
geoffrey
was
becoming
harassed
by
this
but
he
hated
to
appear
a
prude
and
said
i
have
got
a
wife
you
know
fujinami
she
is
keeping
an
eye
on
me
no
matter
no
matter
the
young
man
answered
waving
his
hand
to
and
fro
we
all
have
wife
wife
no
matter
in
japan
at
last
geoffrey
got
back
to
his
throne
at
asako
side
he
was
wondering
what
would
be
the
next
move
in
the
game
when
to
his
relief
and
surprise
ito
after
a
glance
at
his
watch
said
suddenly
it
is
now
time
to
go
home
please
say
to
and
mrs
fujinami
a
sudden
dismissal
but
none
the
less
welcome
the
inner
circle
of
the
fujinami
had
gathered
round
they
and
the
escorted
their
guests
to
the
rickshaws
and
helped
them
on
with
their
cloaks
and
boots
there
was
no
pressing
to
remain
and
as
geoffrey
passed
the
clock
in
the
entrance
hall
he
noticed
that
it
was
just
ten
evidently
the
entertainment
was
run
with
strict
adherence
to
the
some
of
the
guests
were
too
deep
in
and
flirtation
to
be
aware
of
the
and
the
last
vision
granted
to
geoffrey
of
the
the
fat
man
with
the
wen
was
of
a
kind
of
turkey
trot
going
on
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
the
thick
arms
of

in

into

left
moving
noiselessly
so
as
not
to

the
master
who
is
still
sleeping
they
remove
from
his
side
the
thick
warm
mattresses
upon
which
his

has
been
lying
the
hard
wooden
pillow
like
the

the

fold
them
and
put
them
away
into
an
unsuspected
cupboard
in
the

fujinami
gentaro
still
snores
after
a
while
his
wife
returns
she
is
dressed
for
the
morning
in
a
plain
grey
silk
kimono
with
a
broad
sash
her
hair
is
arranged
in
a
formidable
all
japanese
matrons
with
their
hair
done
properly
bear
a
remote
resemblance
to
pallas

this
will
need
the
attention
of
the
hairdresser
so
as
to
wax
into
obedience
a
few
hairs
left
wayward
by
the
night
in
spite
of
that
severe
wooden
pillow
whose
hard
high
discomfort
was
invented
by
female
vanity
to
preserve
from
disarray
the
rigid
order
of
their
locks
her
feet
are
encased
in
little
white
like
gloves
for
the
big
toe
has
a
compartment
all
to
itself
she
walks
with
her
toes
turned
in
and
with
the
heels
hardly
touching
the
ground
this
movement
produces
a
bend
of
the
knees
and
hips
so
as
to
maintain
the
equilibrium
of
the
body
and
a
sinuous
appearance
which
is
considered
the
height
of
elegance
in
japan
so
that
the
grace
of
a
beautiful
woman
is
likened
to
a
blown
by
the
wind
and
the
shuffle
of
her
feet
on
the
to
the
whisper
fujinami
carries
a
red
lacquer
tray
on
the
tray
is
a
tiny
teapot
and
a
tiny
cup
and
a
tiny
dish
in
which
are
three
little
salted
damsons
with
a
toothpick
fixed
in
one
of
them
it
is
the
of
her
lord
she
put
down
the
tray
beside
the
head
of
the
pillow
and
makes
a
low
obeisance
touching
the
floor
with
her
forehead
hay
fujinami
stirs
gapes
stretches
yawns
rubs
his
lean
fist
in
his
hollow
eyes
and
stares
at
the
rude
incursion
of
daylight
he
takes
no
notice
of
his
wife
presence
she
pours
out
tea
for
him
with
studied
pose
of
hands
and
wrists
conventional
and
graceful
she
respectfully
requests
him
to
condescend
to
partake
then
she
makes
obeisance
again
fujinami
yawns
once
more
after
which
he
condescends
he
sucks
down
the
thin
green
tea
with
a
whistling
noise
then
he
places
in
his
mouth
the
damson
balanced
on
the
point
of
the
toothpick
he
turns
it
over
and
over
with
his
tongue
as
though
he
was
chewing
a
cud
finally
he
decides
to
eat
it
and
to
remove
the
stone
then
he
rises
from
his
couch
he
is
a
very
small
wizened
man
dressed
in
his
night
kimono
of
light
blue
silk
he
passes
along
the
veranda
in
the
direction
of
the
morning
ablutions
soon
the
rending
sounds
of
show
that
he
has
begun
his
three
maids
appear
as
by
magic
in
the
vacated
room
the
bed
is
rolled
away
the
matting
swept
and
the
master
morning
clothes
are
laid
out
ready
for
him
on
his
return
fujinami
assists
her
husband
to
dress
holding
each
garment
ready
for
him
to
slip
into
like
a
valet
fujinami
does
not
speak
to
her
when
his
belt
has
been
adjusted
and
a
watch
with
a
gold
fob
thrust
into
its
interstice
he
steps
down
from
the
veranda
slides
his
feet
into
a
pair
of
and
strolls
out
into
the
garden
fujinami
garden
is
a
famous
one
it
is
a
temple
garden
many
centuries
old
and
the
eyes
of
the
initiated
may
read
in
the
miniature
landscape
in
the
grouping
of
shrubs
and
rocks
in
the
sudden
glimpses
of
water
and
in
the
bare
pebbly
beaches
a
whole
system
of
philosophic
and
religious
thought
worked
out
by
the
patient
priests
of
the
ashikaga
period
just
as
the
gothic
masons
wrote
their
version
of
the
bible
history
in
the
architecture
of
their
cathedrals
but
for
the
ignorant
including
its
present
master
it
was
just
a
perfect
little
park
with
lawns
six
feet
square
and
ancient
pine
trees
with
impenetrable
forests
which
one
could
clear
at
a
bound
with
gorges
waterfalls
arbours
for
lilliputian
philanderings
and
a
lake
round
whose
tiny
shores
were
represented
the
eight
beautiful
views
of
the
lake
of
biwa
near
kyoto
the
bungalow
mansion
of
the
family
lies
on
a
knoll
overlooking
the
lake
and
the
garden
valley
a
rambling
construction
of
brown
wood
with
grey
tiles
resembling
a
domesticated
dragon
stretching
itself
in
the
sun
indeed
it
is
not
one
house
but
many
linked
together
by
a
number
of
corridors
and
spare
rooms
for
and
fujinami
live
in
one
wing
their
son
and
his
wife
in
another
and
also
ito
the
lawyer
who
is
a
distant
relative
and
a
partner
in
the
fujinami
business
then
on
the
farther
side
of
the
house
near
the
pebble
drive
and
the
great
gate
are
the
swarming
quarters
of
the
servants
the
rickshaw
men
and
fujinami
secretaries
various
poor
relations
exist
unobserved
in
unfrequented
corners
and
there
is
the
following
of
university
students
and
professional
swashbucklers
which
every
important
japanese
is
bound
to
keep
as
an
advertisement
of
his
generosity
and
to
do
his
dirty
work
for
him
a
japanese
family
mansion
is
very
like
a
hive
of
drones
nor
is
this
the
entire
population
of
the
fujinami
across
the
garden
and
beyond
the
bamboo
grove
is
the
little
house
of
fujinami
stepbrother
and
his
wife
and
in
the
opposite
corner
below
the
is
the
the
dower
house
where
old
fujinami
gennosuké
the
retired
lord
who
is
the
present
fujinami
father
by
adoption
only
watches
the
progress
of
the
family
fortunes
with
the
vigilance
of
charles
the
fifth
in
the
cloister
of
juste
fujinami
gentaro
shuffled
his
way
towards
a
little
room
like
a
kind
of
detached
from
the
main
building
and
overlooking
the
lake
and
garden
from
the
most
favourable
point
of
vantage
this
is
fujinami
study
like
all
japanese
rooms
a
square
box
with
wooden
framework
wooden
ceiling
sliding
paper
pale
golden
and
double
alcove
all
japanese
rooms
are
just
the
same
from
the
emperor
to
the
only
in
the
quality
of
the
wood
in
the
workmanship
of
the
fittings
in
the
newness
and
freshness
of
paper
and
matting
and
by
the
ornaments
placed
in
the
alcove
may
the
prosperity
of
the
house
be
known
in
fujinami
study
one
niche
of
the
alcove
was
fitted
up
as
a
bookcase
and
that
bookcase
was
made
of
a
wonderful
satinwood
brought
from
the
hinterland
of
china
the
lock
and
the
handles
were
inlaid
with
dainty
designs
in
gold
wrought
by
a
celebrated
kyoto
artist
in
the
open
alcove
the
hanging
scroll
of
lao
tze
paradise
had
cost
many
hundreds
of
pounds
as
had
also
the
sung
dish
below
it
an
intricacy
of
lotus
leaves
caved
out
of
a
single
amethyst
on
a
table
in
the
middle
of
this
chaste
apartment
lay
a
pair
of
spectacles
and
a
yellow
book
the
room
was
open
to
the
early
morning
sunlight
the
paper
walls
were
pushed
back
fujinami
moved
a
square
silk
cushion
to
the
edge
of
the
matting
near
the
outside
veranda
there
he
could
rest
his
back
against
a
post
in
the
framework
of
the
building
for
even
japanese
get
wearied
by
the
interminable
squatting
which
life
on
the
floor
level
entails
and
acquire
that
condition
of
bodily
repose
which
is
essential
for
meditation
fujinami
was
in
the
habit
of
meditating
for
one
hour
every
morning
it
was
a
tradition
of
his
house
his
father
and
his
grandfather
had
done
so
before
him
the
guide
of
his
meditations
was
the
yellow
book
the
maxims
of
confucius
that
bible
of
the
far
east
which
has
moulded
oriental
morality
to
the
shape
of
the
three
obediences
the
obedience
of
the
child
to
his
parents
of
the
wife
to
her
husband
and
of
the
servant
to
his
lord
fujinami
sat
on
the
sill
of
his
study
and
meditated
around
him
was
the
stillness
of
early
morning
from
the
house
could
be
heard
the
swish
of
the
maids
brooms
brushing
the
and
the
of
their
paper
flickers
like
horses
tails
with
which
they
dislodged
the
dust
from
the
walls
and
cornices
a
big
black
crow
had
been
perched
on
one
of
the
in
the
garden
he
rose
with
a
shaking
of
branches
and
a
flapping
of
broad
black
wings
he
crossed
the
lake
croaking
as
he
flew
with
a
note
more
harsh
rasping
and
cynical
than
the
consequential
caw
of
english
rooks
his
was
a
malevolent
presence
from
the
night
plutonian
shore
the
symbol
of
something
unclean
and
sinister
lurking
behind
this
dainty
beauty
and
this
elaboration
of
cleanliness
fujinami
meditations
were
deep
and
grave
soon
he
put
down
the
book
the
spectacles
glided
along
his
nose
his
chest
rose
and
fell
quickly
under
the
weight
of
his
resting
chin
to
the
ignorant
observer
fujinami
would
have
appeared
to
be
asleep
however
when
his
wife
appeared
about
an
hour
and
a
half
afterwards
bringing
her
lord
breakfast
on
another
red
lacquer
table
she
besought
him
kindly
to
condescend
to
eat
and
added
that
he
must
be
very
tired
after
so
much
study
to
this
fujinami
replied
by
passing
his
hand
over
his
forehead
and
saying
m
so
des
né
indeed
it
is
so
i
have
tired
myself
with
toil
this
little
farce
repeated
itself
every
morning
all
the
household
knew
that
the
master
hour
of
meditation
was
merely
an
excuse
for
an
but
it
was
a
tradition
in
the
family
that
the
master
should
study
thus
and
fujinami
grandfather
had
been
a
great
scholar
in
his
generation
to
maintain
the
tradition
fujinami
had
hired
a
starveling
journalist
to
write
a
series
of
random
essays
of
a
sentimental
nature
which
he
had
published
under
his
own
name
with
the
title
such
is
the
hold
of
humbug
in
japan
that
nobody
in
the
whole
household
including
the
students
who
respected
nothing
ever
allowed
themselves
the
relief
of
smiling
at
the
sacred
hour
of
study
even
when
the
master
back
was
turned
hay
for
honourable
feast
of
yesterday
evening
indeed
very
much
obliged
the
oily
forehead
of
ito
touched
the
matting
floor
with
the
exaggerated
humility
of
conventional
gratitude
the
lawyer
wore
a
plain
kimono
of
silk
his
american
manners
and
his
pomposity
had
both
been
laid
aside
with
the
tweed
suit
and
the
he
was
now
a
plain
japanese
business
man
servile
and
adulatory
in
his
patron
presence
fujinami
gentaro
bowed
slightly
in
acknowledgment
across
the
remnants
of
his
meal
it
is
no
matter
he
said
with
a
few
waves
of
his
fan
please
sit
at
your
ease
the
two
gentlemen
arranged
themselves
squatting
for
the
morning
confidential
talk
the
ito
began
with
a
sweep
of
the
arm
towards
the
garden
grove
how
quickly
they
fall
alas
indeed
human
life
also
agreed
fujinami
but
the
guests
of
last
evening
what
is
one
to
think
in
truth
master
or
teacher
it
would
be
impossible
not
to
call
that
asa
san
a
beauty
ito
kun
said
his
relative
in
a
tone
of
mild
censure
it
is
foolish
always
to
think
of
women
looks
this
foreigner
what
of
him
for
a
foreigner
that
person
seems
to
be
honourable
and
grave
answered
the
retainer
but
one
fears
that
it
is
a
misfortune
for
the
house
of
fujinami
to
have
a
son
who
is
no
son
said
the
head
of
the
family
sighing
m
it
is
terrible
was
the
reply
besides
as
the
so
eloquently
said
last
night
there
are
so
few
blossoms
on
the
old
tree
the
better
to
aid
his
thoughts
fujinami
drew
from
about
his
person
a
case
which
contained
a
thin
bamboo
pipe
called
in
japanese
having
a
metal
bowl
of
the
size
and
shape
of
the
socket
of
an
acorn
he
filled
this
diminutive
bowl
with
a
little
wad
of
tobacco
which
looked
like
coarse
brown
hair
he
kindled
it
from
the
charcoal
ember
in
the
he
took
three
sucks
of
smoke
breathing
them
slowly
out
of
his
mouth
again
in
thick
grey
whorls
then
with
three
hard
raps
against
the
wooden
edge
of
the
firebox
he
knocked
out
again
the
glowing
ball
of
weed
when
this
ritual
was
over
he
replaced
the
pipe
in
its
sheath
of
old
brocade
the
lawyer
sucked
in
his
breath
and
bowed
his
head
in
family
matters
he
said
it
is
rude
for
an
outside
person
to
advise
the
master
but
last
night
i
saw
a
dream
i
saw
the
englishman
had
been
sent
back
to
england
and
that
this
asa
san
with
all
her
money
was
again
in
the
fujinami
family
indeed
a
foolish
dream
but
a
good
thing
i
think
fujinami
pondered
with
his
face
inclined
and
his
eyes
shut
ito
kun
he
said
at
last
you
are
indeed
a
great
schemer
every
month
you
make
one
hundred
schemes
ninety
of
them
are
impracticable
eight
of
them
are
foolish
and
two
of
them
are
masterpieces
and
this
one
asked
ito
i
think
it
is
impracticable
said
his
patron
but
it
would
be
worth
while
to
try
it
would
without
doubt
be
an
advantage
to
send
away
this
foreigner
he
is
a
great
trouble
and
may
even
become
a
danger
besides
the
house
of
fujinami
has
few
children
where
there
are
no
sons
even
daughters
are
welcome
if
we
had
this
asa
we
could
marry
her
to
some
influential
person
she
is
very
beautiful
she
is
rich
and
she
speaks
foreign
languages
there
would
be
no
difficulty
now
as
to
the
present
how
about
this
osaka
business
i
have
heard
from
my
friend
this
morning
answered
ito
it
is
good
news
the
governor
will
sanction
the
establishment
of
the
new
licensed
quarter
at
tobita
if
the
home
minister
approves
but
that
is
easy
the
minister
has
always
protected
us
besides
did
i
not
give
fifty
thousand
to
the
funds
of
the
said
fujinami
naming
the
political
party
then
in
the
majority
in
parliament
yes
but
it
must
be
done
quickly
for
opposition
is
being
organised
first
there
was
the
salvation
army
and
the
missionaries
now
there
are
japanese
people
too
people
who
make
a
cry
and
say
this
licensed
prostitute
system
is
not
suitable
to
a
civilised
country
and
it
is
a
shame
to
japan
also
there
may
be
a
political
change
very
soon
and
a
new
minister
then
we
would
have
to
begin
all
over
again
another
fifty
thousand
to
the
other
side
if
it
is
worth
it
my
father
says
that
osaka
is
the
gold
mine
of
japan
it
is
worth
all
that
we
can
pay
yes
but
fujinami
gennosuké
is
an
old
man
now
and
the
times
are
changing
the
master
laughed
times
change
he
said
but
men
and
women
never
change
it
is
true
argued
ito
that
rich
and
noble
persons
no
longer
frequent
the
pleasure
enclosure
my
friend
suzuki
has
seen
the
chief
of
the
metropolitan
police
he
says
that
he
will
not
be
able
to
permit
another
year
he
says
too
that
it
will
soon
be
forbidden
to
show
the
in
their
windows
it
will
be
for
all
houses
it
is
all
a
sign
of
the
change
therefore
the
fujinami
ought
not
to
sink
any
more
capital
in
the
but
men
will
still
be
men
they
will
still
need
a
laundry
for
their
spirits
fujinami
used
a
phrase
which
in
japan
is
a
common
excuse
for
those
who
frequent
the
that
is
true
said
the
counsellor
but
our
japan
must
take
on
a
show
of
western
civilisation
it
is
the
thing
called
progress
it
is
part
of
western
civilisation
that
men
will
become
more
hypocritical
these
foreigners
say
our
yoshiwara
is
a
shame
but
in
their
own
cities
immoral
women
walk
in
the
best
streets
and
offer
themselves
to
men
quite
openly
these
virtuous
foreigners
are
worse
than
we
are
i
myself
have
seen
they
say
have
no
yoshiwara
system
therefore
we
are
good
they
pretend
not
to
see
like
a
who
squints
through
a
fan
we
japanese
we
now
become
more
hypocritical
because
this
is
necessary
law
of
civilisation
the
two
swords
of
the
have
gone
but
honour
and
hatred
and
revenge
will
never
go
the
hair
ornaments
of
the
will
go
too
but
what
the
lose
the
will
gain
therefore
if
i
were
fujinami
san
i
would
buy
up
the
and
also
perhaps
the
unregistered
women
but
that
is
a
low
trade
objected
the
yoshiwara
magnate
it
is
very
secret
your
name
need
never
be
spoken
and
it
is
too
scattered
too
disorganised
it
would
be
impossible
to
control
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
so
difficult
what
might
be
proposed
is
a
trust
but
even
the
fujinami
have
not
got
enough
money
within
one
month
i
guarantee
to
find
the
right
men
with
the
money
and
the
experience
and
the
influence
then
the
business
would
no
longer
be
the
fujinami
only
it
would
be
as
in
america
a
combine
something
on
a
big
scale
in
japan
one
is
content
with
such
small
business
indeed
we
japanese
are
a
very
small
people
in
america
perhaps
there
is
more
confidence
said
the
elder
man
but
in
japan
we
say
of
friends
who
are
not
also
relatives
there
is
as
you
know
the
temple
of
inari
daimy
jin
in
asakusa
they
say
that
if
a
man
worships
at
that
temple
he
becomes
the
owner
of
his
friend
wealth
i
fear
that
too
many
of
us
japanese
make
pilgrimage
to
that
temple
after
nightfall
with
those
words
fujinami
picked
up
a
newspaper
to
indicate
that
the
audience
was
terminated
and
ito
after
a
series
of
prostrations
withdrew
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
sight
fujinami
gentaro
selected
from
the
pile
in
front
of
him
a
number
of
letters
and
newspapers
with
these
in
his
hand
he
left
the
study
and
followed
a
path
of
broad
flat
across
the
garden
towards
the
here
the
way
sloped
rapidly
downward
under
a
drift
of
fallen
petals
on
the
black
naked
twigs
of
the
one
or
two
sturdy
blossoms
still
clung
pathetically
like
butterflies
beyond
a
green
shrubbery
on
a
little
knoll
a
clean
japanese
house
like
a
large
rabbit
hutch
rested
in
a
patch
of
sunlight
it
was
the
the
shadow
dwelling
or
dower
house
here
dwelt
fujinami
senior
and
his
wife
his
fourth
matrimonial
experiment
the
old
gentleman
was
squatting
on
the
balcony
of
the
front
corner
room
the
one
which
commanded
the
best
view
of
the
he
looked
as
if
he
had
just
been
unpacked
for
he
was
surrounded
by
reams
and
reams
of
paper
some
white
and
some
with
chinese
letters
scrawled
over
them
he
was
busy
writing
these
letters
with
a
kind
of
thick
and
he
was
so
deep
in
his
task
that
he
appeared
not
to
notice
his
son
approach
his
restless
jaw
was
still
imperturbably
chewing
hay
yo
o
hay
cried
the
old
gentleman
calling
his
son
by
his
short
boy
name
and
cutting
off
all
honorifics
from
his
speech
he
always
affected
surprise
at
this
visit
which
had
been
a
daily
occurrence
for
many
years
the
are
fallen
and
finished
said
the
younger
man
ah
human
life
how
short
a
thing
yes
one
year
more
i
have
seen
the
flowers
said
fujinami
gennosuké
nodding
his
head
and
taking
his
son
generalisation
as
a
personal
reference
he
had
laid
his
brush
aside
and
he
was
really
wondering
what
would
be
gentaro
comment
on
last
night
feast
and
its
guests
of
honour
father
is
practising
handwriting
again
the
old
man
mania
was
penmanship
just
as
his
son
was
literature
among
japanese
it
is
considered
the
pastime
becoming
to
his
age
my
wrist
has
become
stiff
i
can
not
write
as
i
used
to
it
is
always
so
youth
has
the
strength
but
not
the
knowledge
age
has
the
knowledge
but
no
strength
as
a
matter
of
fact
gennosuké
was
immensely
satisfied
with
his
calligraphy
and
was
waiting
for
compliments
but
this
this
is
beautifully
written
it
is
worthy
of
kobo
daishi
said
the
younger
man
naming
a
famous
scholar
priest
of
the
middle
ages
he
was
admiring
a
scroll
on
which
four
characters
were
written
in
a
perpendicular
row
they
signified
from
the
midst
of
tranquillity
i
survey
the
world
no
said
the
artist
you
see
the
point
there
is
wrong
it
is
it
should
be
written
thus
shaking
back
his
kimono
sleeve
he
wore
a
cotton
kimono
as
befitted
his
years
and
with
a
little
flourish
of
his
wrist
like
a
golfer
about
to
make
his
stroke
he
traced
off
the
new
version
of
the
character
on
the
white
paper
perched
on
his
veranda
with
his
head
on
one
side
he
looked
very
like
the
marabout
stork
as
you
may
see
him
at
the
zoo
that
raffish
bird
with
the
folds
in
his
neck
the
stained
glaucous
complexion
the
bald
head
and
the
brown
human
eye
he
had
the
same
look
of
respectable
rascality
the
younger
fujinami
showed
signs
of
becoming
exactly
like
him
although
the
parentage
was
by
adoption
only
he
was
not
yet
so
bald
his
black
hair
was
patched
with
grey
in
a
piebald
design
the
skin
of
the
throat
was
at
present
merely
loose
it
did
not
yet
hang
in
bags
and
this
asa
san
remarked
the
elder
after
a
pause
what
is
to
be
thought
of
her
last
night
i
became
drunk
as
my
habit
is
and
i
could
not
see
those
people
well
she
is
not
and
bold
like
foreign
women
indeed
her
voice
and
her
eyes
are
soft
her
heart
is
very
good
i
think
she
is
timid
and
in
everything
she
puts
her
husband
first
she
does
not
understand
the
world
at
all
and
she
knows
nothing
about
money
indeed
she
is
like
a
perfect
japanese
wife
hm
a
good
thing
and
the
husband
he
is
a
soldier
an
honourable
man
he
seemed
foolish
or
else
he
is
very
cunning
the
english
people
are
like
that
they
say
a
thing
of
course
you
think
it
is
a
lie
but
no
it
is
the
truth
and
so
they
deceive
indeed
and
why
has
this
foreigner
come
to
japan
ito
says
he
has
come
to
learn
about
the
money
that
means
when
he
knows
he
will
want
more
how
much
do
we
pay
to
asa
san
ten
per
cent
and
the
profits
last
year
on
all
our
business
came
to
thirty
seven
and
a
half
per
cent
ah
a
fine
gain
we
could
not
borrow
from
the
banks
at
ten
per
cent
they
would
want
at
least
fifteen
and
many
gifts
for
silence
it
is
better
to
fool
the
husband
and
to
let
them
go
back
to
england
after
all
ten
per
cent
is
a
good
rate
and
we
want
all
our
money
now
for
the
new
brothels
in
osaka
if
we
make
much
money
there
then
afterwards
we
can
give
them
more
ito
says
that
if
the
englishman
knows
that
the
money
is
made
in
brothels
he
will
throw
it
all
away
and
finish
ito
thinks
it
would
be
not
impossible
to
send
the
englishman
back
to
england
and
to
keep
asa
here
in
japan
the
old
man
looked
up
suddenly
and
for
once
his
jaw
stopped
chewing
that
would
be
best
of
all
he
exclaimed
then
indeed
he
is
honourable
and
a
great
fool
being
an
englishman
it
is
possible
let
him
go
back
to
england
we
will
keep
asa
she
too
is
a
fujinami
and
even
though
she
is
a
woman
she
can
be
useful
to
the
family
she
will
stay
with
us
she
would
not
like
to
be
poor
she
has
not
borne
a
baby
to
this
foreigner
and
she
is
young
i
think
also
our
sada
can
teach
her
many
things
it
is
of
sada
that
i
came
to
speak
to
father
said
gentaro
the
marriage
of
our
sada
is
a
great
question
for
the
fujinami
family
here
is
a
letter
from
osumi
a
friend
of
the
governor
of
osaka
the
governor
has
been
of
much
help
to
us
in
getting
the
concession
for
the
new
brothels
he
is
a
widower
with
no
children
he
is
a
man
with
a
future
he
is
protected
by
the
military
clan
he
is
wishful
to
marry
a
woman
who
can
assist
his
career
and
who
would
be
able
to
take
the
place
of
a
minister
wife
osumi
who
writes
had
heard
of
the
accomplishments
of
our
sada
he
mentioned
her
name
to
the
governor
and
his
excellency
was
quite
willing
that
osumi
should

grunted
the
old
gentleman
squinting
sidelong
at
his
son
this
governor
has
he
a
private
fortune
no
he
is
a
man
then
it
will
not
be
with
him
as
it
was
with
that
viscount
kamimura
he
will
not
be
too
proud
to
take
our
money
the
truth
of
the
allusion
to
viscount
kamimura
was
that
the
name
of
sadako
fujinami
had
figured
on
the
list
of
possible
brides
submitted
to
that
young
aristocrat
on
his
return
from
england
at
first
it
seemed
likely
that
the
choice
would
fall
upon
her
because
of
her
undisputed
cleverness
and
the
fujinami
family
were
radiant
at
the
prospect
of
so
brilliant
a
match
for
although
nothing
had
been
formally
mentioned
between
the
two
families
yet
sadako
and
her
mother
had
learned
from
their
hairdresser
that
there
was
talk
of
such
a
possibility
in
the
servants
quarter
of
the
kamimura
mansion
and
that
old
dowager
viscountess
kamimura
was
undoubtedly
making
inquiries
which
could
only
point
to
that
one
object
the
young
viscount
however
on
ascertaining
the
origin
of
the
family
wealth
eliminated
poor
sadako
from
the
competition
for
his
hand
it
was
a
great
disappointment
to
the
fujinami
and
most
of
all
to
the
ambitious
sadako
for
a
moment
she
had
seen
opening
the
doorway
into
that
marvellous
world
of
high
diplomacy
of
european
capitals
of
diamonds
duchesses
and
intrigue
of
which
she
had
read
in
foreign
novels
where
everybody
is
rich
brilliant
immoral
and
distinguished
and
where
to
women
are
given
the
rôles
to
play
even
more
important
than
those
of
the
men
this
was
the
only
world
she
felt
worthy
of
her
talents
but
few
very
few
just
one
in
a
million
japanese
women
ever
gets
the
remotest
chance
of
entering
it
this
chance
presented
itself
to
sadako
but
for
a
moment
only
the
doorway
shut
to
again
and
sadako
was
left
feeling
more
acutely
than
before
the
emptiness
of
life
and
the
bitterness
of
woman
lot
in
a
land
where
men
are
supreme
her
cousin
asako
by
the
mere
luck
of
having
had
an
eccentric
parent
and
a
european
upbringing
possessed
all
the
advantages
and
all
the
experience
which
the
japanese
girl
knew
only
through
the
glamorous
medium
of
books
but
this
asa
san
was
a
fool
sadako
had
found
that
out
at
once
in
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
talk
at
the
maple
club
dinner
she
was
sweet
gentle
and
innocent
far
more
japanese
indeed
than
her
sophisticated
cousin
her
obvious
respect
and
affection
for
her
big
rough
husband
her
pathetic
solicitude
for
the
father
whose
face
she
could
hardly
remember
and
for
the
mother
who
was
nothing
but
a
name
these
traits
of
character
belong
to
the
meek
japanese
girl
of
woman
great
learning
that
famous
classic
of
japanese
girlhood
which
teaches
the
submission
of
women
and
the
superiority
of
men
it
was
a
type
which
was
becoming
rare
in
her
own
country
little
asako
had
nothing
in
common
with
the
argumentative
heroines
of
bernard
shaw
or
with
the
desperate
viragos
of
ibsen
to
whom
sadako
felt
herself
spiritually
akin
asako
must
be
a
fool
she
exasperated
her
japanese
cousin
who
at
the
same
time
was
envious
of
her
envious
above
all
of
her
independent
wealth
as
she
observed
to
her
own
mother
it
was
most
improper
that
a
woman
and
a
young
woman
too
should
have
so
much
money
of
her
own
it
would
be
sure
to
spoil
her
character
meanwhile
asako
was
a
way
of
access
to
knowledge
of
that
world
of
european
womanhood
which
so
strongly
attracted
intelligence
that
almost
incredible
world
in
which
men
and
women
were
equal
had
equal
rights
to
property
and
equal
rights
to
love
asako
must
have
seen
enough
to
explain
something
about
it
if
only
she
were
not
a
fool
but
it
appeared
that
she
had
never
heard
of
strindberg
sudermann
or
and
even
bernard
shaw
and
oscar
wilde
were
unfamiliar
names

miss

made
up
her
mind
to
cultivate

friendship
and
to
learn
all
that
she
could
from
her
so
she
at

invited

asako
at

behind

were

the

into

room
overlooking
the

garden
she
could
not
repress
an
ah
of
wonder
when
first
this
fairy
pleasance
came
in
sight
it
was
all
so
green
so
tiny
and
so
perfect
the
undulating
lawn
the
sheet
of
silver
water
the
pigmy
forests
which
clothed
its
shores
its
disappearance
round
a
shoulder
of
rock
into
that
hinterland
of
high
trees
which
closed
the
vista
and
shut
out
the
intrusion
of
the
squalid
city
the
japanese
understand
better
than
we
do
the
mesmeric
effects
of
sights
and
sounds
it
was
to
give
her
time
to
assimilate
her
surroundings
that
asako
was
left
alone
for
half
an
hour
or
so
while
sadako
and
her
mother
were
combing
their
hair
and
putting
their
kimonos
straight
tea
and
biscuits
were
brought
for
her
but
her
fancy
was
astray
in
the
garden
already
to
her
imagination
a
little
town
had
sprung
up
along
the
shingles
of
the
tiny
bay
which
faced
her
the
sails
of
white
ships
were
glimpsing
where
the
sunlight
struck
the
water
and
from
round
the
rock
promontory
she
could
catch
the
shimmer
of
the
prince
galleon
with
its
high
poop
and
stern
covered
with
solid
gold
he
was
on
his
way
to
rescue
the
lady
who
was
immured
in
the
top
of
the
red
pagoda
on
the
opposite
hill
asako
legs
were
getting
numb
she
had
been
sitting
on
them
in
correct
japanese
fashion
all
this
time
she
was
proud
of
the
accomplishment
which
she
considered
must
be
hereditary
but
she
could
not
keep
it
up
for
much
longer
than
half
an
hour
sadako

bowing
began
in
which
asako
felt
her
disadvantage
the
long
lines
of
the
kimono
with
the
big
sash
tied
behind
lend
themselves
with
peculiar
grace
to
the
squatting
bow
of
japanese
intercourse
but
asako
in
the
short
blue
jacket
of
her
serge
felt
that
her
attitude
was
that
of
the
naughty
little
boys
in
english
picture
books
bending
over
for
castigation
fujinami
wore
a
perfectly
plain
kimono
in
colour
with
a
plain
gold
sash
it
is
considered
correct
for
ladies
in
japan
to
dress
with
modesty
and
reserve
she
was
tall
for
a
japanese
woman
and
with
a
long
and
an
almost
jewish
nose
the
daughter
was
of
her
mother
build
but
her
face
was
a
perfect
oval
the
shape
which
is
so
highly
esteemed
in
her
country
the
severity
of
her
appearance
was
increased
by
her
spectacles
and
like
so
many
japanese
women
her
teeth
were
full
of
gold
stopping
she
was
resplendent
in
blue
the
blue
of
the
mediterranean
with
fronds
of
and
floating
pink
petals
designed
round
her
skirts
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
long
exaggerated
sleeves
the
sash
of
broad
stiff
brocade
shone
with
light
blue
and
silver
in
a
kind
of
conventional
wave
pattern
this
was
tied
at
the
back
with
a
huge
bow
which
seemed
perched
upon
its
wearer
like
a
gigantic
butterfly
alighting
on
a
cornflower
her
straight
black
hair
was
parted
on
one
side
in
foreign
style
but
her
mother
wore
the
the
edifice
of
conservative
taste
in
married
women
which
looks
more
like
a
wig
than
like
natural
hair
rings
sparkled
on
sadako
fingers
and
she
wore
a
diamond
ornament
across
her
sash
but
neither
their
taste
nor
their
quality
impressed
her
cousin
her
face
was
of
the
same
ivory
tint
as
asako
but
it
was
hidden
under
a
lavish
coating
of
liquid
powder
this
hideous
embellishment
covers
not
only
the
mongolian
yellow
which
every
japanese
woman
seems
anxious
to
hide
but
also
the
natural
and
charming
nuances
of
young
skin
under
a
white
monotonous
surface
like
a
mask
of
clay
painted
roses
bloomed
on
the
girl
cheeks
the
eyebrows
were
artificially
darkened
as
well
as
the
lines
round
the
eyes
the
face
and
its
expression
in
fact
were
quite
obscured
by
cosmetics
and
miss
fujinami
was
wrapped
in
a
cloud
of
cheap
scent
like
a
on
her
evening
out
she
spoke
english
well
in
fact
at
school
she
had
achieved
a
really
brilliant
career
and
she
had
even
attended
a
university
for
a
time
with
the
intention
of
reading
for
a
degree
an
attainment
rare
among
japanese
girls
but
overwork
brought
on
its
inevitable
result
books
had
to
be
banished
and
glasses
interposed
to
save
the
tired
eyes
from
the
light
it
was
a
bitter
disappointment
for
sadako
who
was
a
proud
and
ambitious
girl
and
it
had
not
improved
her
disposition
after
the
first
formalities
asako
was
shown
round
the
house
the
sameness
of
the
rooms
surprised
her
there
was
nothing
to
distinguish
them
except
the
different
woods
used
in
their
ceilings
and
walls
a
distinction
which
betrayed
its
costliness
and
its
taste
only
to
the
practised
eye
each
room
was
spotless
and
absolutely
bare
with
golden
mats
with
edgings
of
black
braid
fixed
into
the
flooring
by
whose
number
the
size
of
a
japanese
room
is
measured
asako
admired
the
pale
white
the
sliding
windows
of
opaque
glowing
paper
along
the
side
of
the
room
open
to
the
outdoor
light
the
or
sliding
partitions
between
room
and
room
set
in
the
framework
of
the
house
some
of
them
charmingly
painted
with
sketches
of
scenery
flowers
or
people
some
of
them
plain
boards
flecked
with
tiny
specks
of
gold
nothing
broke
the
sameness
of
these
rooms
except
the
double
alcove
or
with
its
inevitable
hanging
picture
its
inevitable
ornament
and
its
spray
of
blossom
between
the
double
niche
stood
that
pillar
of
wood
which
sadako
explained
as
being
the
soul
of
the
room
the
leading
feature
from
which
its
character
was
taken
being
either
plain
and
firm
or
twisted
and
ornate
or
else
still
unshaped
with
the
bosses
of
amputated
branches
seared
and
black
protesting
against
confinement
the
as
the
word
suggests
must
originally
have
been
the
of
the
owner
of
the
room
for
it
certainly
is
the
only
corner
in
a
japanese
house
which
is
secured
from
draughts
but
perhaps
it
was
respect
for
invisible
spirits
which
drove
the
sleeper
eventually
to
abandon
his
coign
of
vantage
to
the
service
of
aesthetic
beauty
and
to
stretch
himself
on
the
open
floor
to
asako
the
rooms
seemed
all
the
same
each
gave
the
same
impression
of
spotlessness
and
nudity
each
was
stiffly
rectangular
like
the
honey
squares
fitted
into
a
hive
above
all
there
was
nothing
about
any
of
them
to
indicate
their
individual
use
or
the
character
of
the
person
to
whom
they
were
specially
assigned
no
or
or
library
where
is
your
bedroom
asked
asako
with
a
frank
demand
for
that
sign
of
sisterhood
among
western
girls
i
should
so
like
to
see
it
i
generally
sleep
answered
the
japanese
girl
in
that
room
at
the
corner
where
we
have
been
already
where
the
bamboo
pictures
are
this
is
the
room
where
father
and
mother
sleep
they
were
standing
on
the
balcony
outside
the
apartment
where
asako
had
first
been
received
but
where
are
the
beds
she
asked
sadako
went
to
the
end
of
the
balcony
and
threw
open
a
big
cupboard
concealed
in
the
outside
of
the
house
it
was
full
of
layers
of
rugs
thick
dark
and
wadded
these
are
the
beds
smiled
the
japanese
cousin
my
brother
takeshi
has
a
foreign
bed
in
his
room
but
my
father
does
not
like
them
or
foreign
clothes
or
foreign
food
or
anything
foreign
he
says
the
japanese
things
are
best
for
the
japanese
but
he
is
very
japanese
style
looks
nicer
said
asako
thinking
how
big
and
vulgar
a
bedstead
would
appear
in
that
clean
emptiness
and
how
awkwardly
its
iron
legs
would
trample
on
the
straw
matting
but
is
it
draughty
and
uncomfortable
i
like
the
foreign
beds
best
said
sadako
my
brother
has
let
me
try
his
it
is
very
soft
so
in
this
country
of
asako
fathers
a
bedstead
was
lent
for
trial
as
though
it
had
been
some
fascinating
novelty
a
bicycle
or
a
piano
the
kitchen
appealed
most
to
the
visitor
it
was
the
only
room
to
her
mind
which
had
any
individuality
of
its
own
it
was
large
dark
and
high
full
of
scuttering
about
like
little
mice
who
bowed
and
then
fled
when
the
two
ladies
came
in
the
stoves
for
boiling
the
rice
interested
asako
round
iron
receptacles
like
coppers
each
resting
on
a
brick
fireplace
everything
was
explained
to
her
the
high
dressers
hung
with
unfamiliar
implements
in
white
metal
and
white
wood
the
brightly
labelled
casks
of
and
sauce
waiting
in
the
darkness
like
the
deputation
of
a
friendly
society
in
its
insignia
of
office
the
silent
jars
of
tea
greenish
in
colour
and
ticketed
with
strange
characters
the
names
of
the
respective
the
iron
kettle
hanging
on
gibbet
chains
from
the
top
of
the
ceiling
over
a
charcoal
fire
sunk
in
the
floor
the
tasteful
design
of
the
commonest
earthenware
bowl
the
little
board
and
chopper
for
slicing
the
raw
fish
the
clean
white
with
their
brass
bindings
polished
and
shining
the
odd
shape
and
entirely
japanese
character
which
distinguished
the
most
ordinary
things
and
gave
to
the
short
squat
knives
a
romantic
air
and
to
the
broad
wooden
spoons
a
suggestion
of
witchcraft
finally
the
little
shrine
to
the
kitchen
god
perched
on
a
shelf
close
to
the
ceiling
looking
like
the
façade
of
a
doll
temple
and
decorated
with
brass
vases
dry
grasses
and
strips
of
white
paper
the
wide
kitchen
was
impregnated
with
a
smell
already
familiar
to
asako
nose
one
of
the
most
typical
odours
of
japan
the
smell
of
native
cooking
humid
acrid
and
heavy
like
the
smell
of
wood
smoke
from
damp
logs
with
a
sour
and
rotten
flavour
to
it
contributed
by
a
kind
of
pickled
called
or
the
great
root
dear
to
the
japanese
palate
the
central
ceremony
of
asako
visit
was
her
introduction
to
the
memory
of
her
dead
parents
she
was
taken
to
a
small
room
where
the
alcove
the
place
of
honour
was
occupied
by
a
closed
cabinet
the
buddha
shelf
a
beautiful
piece
of
joiner
work
in
a
kind
of
lattice
pattern
covered
with
red
lacquer
and
gold
sadako
approaching
reverently
opened
this
shrine
the
interior
was
all
gilt
with
a
dazzling
gold
like
that
used
an
old
manuscripts
in
the
centre
of
this
glory
sat
a
buddha
with
dark
blue
hair
and
cloak
and
an
aureole
of
golden
rays
below
him
were
arranged
the
the
tablets
of
the
dead
miniature
about
one
foot
high
with
a
black
surface
edged
with
gold
upon
which
were
inscribed
the
names
of
the
dead
persons
the
new
names
given
by
the
priests
sadako
stepped
back
and
clapped
her
hands
together
three
times
repeating
the
formula
of
the
nichiren
sect
of
buddhists
my
h
renge
ky
adoration
to
the
wonderful
law
of
the
lotus
scriptures
she
instructed
asako
to
do
the
same
for
she
said
we
believe
that
the
spirits
of
the
dead
people
are
here
and
we
must
be
very
good
to
them
asako
did
as
she
was
told
wondering
whether
her
confessor
would
give
her
penance
for
idolatry
sadako
then
motioned
her
to
sit
on
the
floor
she
took
one
of
the
tablets
from
its
place
and
placed
it
in
front
of
her
cousin
that
is
your
father
she
said
and
then
removing
another
and
placing
it
beside
the
first
she
added
this
is
your
mother
asako
was
deeply
moved
in
england
we
love
our
dead
but
we
consign
them
to
the
care
of
nature
to
the
change
of
the
seasons
and
the
cold
promiscuity
of
the
graveyard
the
japanese
dead
never
seem
to
leave
the
shelter
of
their
home
or
the
circle
of
their
family
we
bring
to
our
dear
ones
flowers
and
prayers
but
the
japanese
give
them
food
and
wine
and
surround
them
with
talk
the
companionship
is
closer
we
chatter
much
about
immortality
we
believe
many
of
us
in
some
undying
particle
we
even
think
that
in
some
other
world
the
dead
may
meet
the
dead
whom
they
have
known
in
life
but
the
actual
communion
of
the
dead
and
the
living
is
for
us
a
beautiful
and
inspiring
metaphor
rather
than
a
concrete
belief
now
the
japanese
although
their
religion
is
so
much
vaguer
than
ours
hardly
question
this
survival
of
the
ancestors
in
the
close
proximity
of
their
children
and
grandchildren
the
little
funeral
tablets
are
for
them
clothed
with
an
invisible
personality
this
is
your
mother
asako
felt
influences
floating
around
her
her
mind
was
in
pain
straining
to
remember
something
which
seemed
to
be
not
wholly
forgotten
just
at
this
moment
fujinami
arrived
carrying
an
old
photograph
album
and
a
roll
of
silk
her
appearance
was
so
opportune
that
any
one
less
innocent
than
asako
might
have
suspected
that
the
scene
had
been
rehearsed
in
the
hush
and
charm
of
that
little
chamber
of
the
spirits
the
face
of
the
elder
woman
looked
soft
and
sweet
she
opened
the
volume
at
the
middle
and
pushed
it
in
front
of
asako
she
saw
the
photograph
of
a
japanese
girl
seated
in
a
chair
with
a
man
standing
at
her
side
with
one
hand
resting
on
the
chair
back
her
father
photograph
she
recognised
at
once
the
broad
forehead
the
deep
eyes
the
aquiline
nose
the
high
cheek
bones
and
the
thin
angry
sarcastic
lips
not
a
typically
japanese
face
but
a
type
recurrent
throughout
our
world
cultured
desperate
and
stricken
asako
had
very
little
in
common
with
her
father
for
his
character
had
been
moulded
or
warped
by
two
powerful
agencies
his
intellect
and
his
disease
and
it
was
well
for
his
daughter
that
she
had
escaped
this
dire
inheritance
but
never
before
had
she
seen
her
mother
face
sometimes
she
had
wondered
who
and
what
her
mother
had
been
what
she
had
thought
of
as
her
baby
grew
within
her
and
with
what
regrets
she
had
exchanged
her
life
for
her
child
more
often
she
had
considered
herself
as
a
being
without
a
mother
a
child
brought
into
this
world
on
a
sunbeam
or
born
from
a
flower
now
she
saw
the
face
which
had
reflected
pain
and
death
for
her
it
was
impassive
and
very
young
pure
oval
in
outline
but
lacking
in
expression
the
smallness
of
the
mouth
was
the
most
characteristic
feature
but
it
was
not
alive
with
smiles
like
her
daughter
it
was
pinched
and
constrained
with
the
lower
lips
drawn
in
the
photograph
was
clearly
a
wedding
souvenir
she
wore
the
black
kimono
of
a
bride
and
the
multiple
skirts
a
kind
of
little
with
silver
charms
dangling
from
it
an
ancient
marriage
symbol
was
thrust
into
the
opening
at
her
breast
her
head
was
covered
with
a
curious
white
cap
like
the
luggage
of
christmas
crackers
she
was
seated
rigidly
at
the
edge
of
her
uncomfortable
chair
and
her
personality
seemed
to
be
overpowered
by
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
did
she
love
him
her
daughter
wondered
as
i
love
geoffrey
through
sadako
interpretation
fujinami
explained
that
mother
name
had
been
yamagata
haruko
spring
child
her
father
had
been
a
in
the
old
days
the
photograph
was
not
very
like
her
it
was
too
serious
like
you
said
the
elder
woman
she
was
always
laughing
and
happy
my
husband
father
used
to
call
her
the
the
cicada
because
she
was
always
singing
her
little
song
she
was
chosen
for
your
father
because
he
was
so
sad
and
wrathful
they
thought
that
she
would
make
him
more
gentle
but
she
died
and
then
he
became
more
sad
than
before
asako
was
crying
very
gently
she
felt
the
touch
of
her
cousin
hand
on
her
arm
the
intellectual
miss
sadako
also
was
weeping
the
tears
furrowing
her
whitened
complexion
the
japanese
are
a
very
emotional
race
the
women
love
tears
and
even
the
men
are
not
averse
from
this
very
natural
expression
of
feeling
which
our
schooling
has
condemned
as
babyish
fujinami
continued
i
saw
her
a
few
days
before
you
were
born
they
lived
in
a
little
house
on
the
bank
of
the
river
one
could
see
the
boats
passing
it
was
very
damp
and
cold
she
talked
all
the
time
of
her
baby
it
is
a
boy
she
said
will
be
happy
if
it
is
a
girl
fujinami
san
will
be
very
anxious
for
the
family
sake
and
the
say
that
it
will
surely
be
a
little
girl
but
she
used
to
say
could
play
better
with
a
little
girl
i
know
what
makes
them
laugh
when
you
were
born
she
became
very
she
never
spoke
again
and
in
a
few
days
she
died
your
father
became
like
a
madman
he
locked
the
house
and
would
not
see
any
of
us
and
as
soon
as
you
were
strong
enough
he
took
you
away
in
a
ship
sadako
placed
in
front
of
her
cousin
the
roll
of
silk
and
said
this
is
japanese
sash
it
belonged
to
your
mother
she
gave
it
to
my
mother
a
short
time
before
you
were
born
for
she
said
is
too
bright
for
me
now
when
i
have
my
baby
i
shall
give
up
society
and
i
shall
spend
all
my
time
with
my
children
my
mother
gives
it
to
you
for
your
mother
sake
it
was
a
wonderful
work
of
art
a
heavy
golden
brocade
embroidered
with
fans
and
on
each
fan
a
japanese
poem
and
a
little
scene
from
the
olden
days
she
was
very
fond
of
this
she
chose
the
poems
herself
but
asako
was
not
admiring
the
beautiful
workmanship
she
was
thinking
of
the
mother
heart
which
had
beat
for
her
under
that
long
strip
of
silk
the
little
japanese
mother
who
would
have
known
how
to
make
her
laugh
tears
were
falling
very
quietly
on
to
the
old
sash
the
two
japanese
women
saw
this
and
with
the
instinctive
tact
of
their
race
they
left
her
alone
face
to
face
with
this
strange
introduction
to
her
mother
personality
there
is
a
peculiar
pathos
about
the
clothes
of
the
dead
they
are
so
nearly
a
part
of
our
bodies
that
it
seems
unnatural
almost
that
they
should
survive
with
the
persistence
of
inanimate
things
when
we
who
gave
them
the
semblance
of
life
are
far
more
dead
than
they
it
would
be
more
seemly
perhaps
if
all
these
things
which
have
belonged
to
us
so
intimately
were
to
perish
with
us
in
a
general
but
the
mania
for
relics
would
never
tolerate
so
complete
a
disappearance
of
one
whom
we
had
loved
and
our
treasuring
of
hair
and
ornaments
and
letters
is
a
desperate
and
perhaps
not
an
entirely
vain
attempt
to
check
the
liberated
spirit
in
its
leap
for
eternity
asako
found
in
that
old
garment
of
her
mother
a
much
more
faithful
reflection
of
the
life
which
had
been
transmitted
to
her
than
the
stiff
photograph
could
ever
realise
she
had
chosen
the
poems
herself
asako
must
get
them
transcribed
and
translated
for
they
would
be
a
sure
indication
of
her
mother
character
already
the
daughter
could
see
that
her
mother
too
must
have
loved
rich
and
beautiful
things
happiness
and
laughter
old
fujinami
had
called
her
the
asako
did
not
yet
know
the
voice
of
the
little
insects
which
are
the
summer
and
autumn
orchestra
of
japan
but
she
knew
that
it
must
be
something
happy
and
sweet
or
they
would
not
have
told
her
she
rose
from
her
knees
and
found
her
cousin
waiting
for
her
on
the
veranda
whatever
real
expression
she
may
have
had
was
effectively
hidden
behind
the
tinted
glasses
and
the
false
white
complexion
now
renovated
from
the
ravages
of
emotion
but
asako
heart
was
won
by
the
power
of
the
dead
of
whom
sadako
and
her
family
were
she
felt
the
living
representatives
asako
took
both
of
her
cousin
hands
in
her
own
it
was
sweet
of
you
and
your
mother
to
give
me
that
she
said
and
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
you
could
not
have
thought
of
anything
which
would
please
me
more
the
japanese
girl
was
on
the
point
of
starting
to
bow
and
smile
the
conventional
apologies
for
the
worthlessness
of
the
gift
when
she
felt
herself
caught
by
a
power
unfamiliar
to
her
the
power
of
the
emotions
of
the
west
the
pressure
on
her
wrists
increased
her
face
was
drawn
down
towards
her
cousin
and
she
felt
against
the
corner
of
her
mouth
the
warm
touch
of
asako
lips
she
started
back
with
a
cry
of
do
the
cry
of
outraged
japanese
femininity
then
she
remembered
from
her
readings
that
such
kissings
were
common
among
european
girls
that
they
were
a
compliment
and
a
sign
of
affection
but
she
hoped
that
it
had
not
disarranged
her
complexion
again
and
that
none
of
the
servants
had
seen
her
cousin
surprise
shook
asako
out
of
her
dream
and
the
kiss
left
a
bitter
powdery
taste
upon
her
lips
which
disillusioned
her
shall
we
go
into
the
garden
said
sadako
who
felt
that
fresh
air
was
advisable
they
joined
hands
so
much
familiarity
was
permitted
by
japanese
etiquette
they
went
along
the
gravel
path
to
the
summit
of
the
little
hillock
where
the
had
lately
been
in
bloom
sadako
in
her
bright
kimono
asako
in
her
dark
suit
she
looked
like
a
mere
mortal
being
introduced
to
the
wonders
of
titania
country
by
an
authentic
fairy
the
sun
was
setting
in
the
clear
sky
one
half
of
which
was
a
tempest
of
orange
gold
and
red
and
the
other
half
warm
and
calm
with
roseate
reflections
over
the
spot
where
the
focus
point
of
all
this
glory
was
sinking
into
darkness
a
purple
cloud
hovered
like
a
shred
of
the
monarch
glory
caught
and
torn
away
on
the
jag
of
some
invisible
obstruction
its
edges
were
white
flame
as
though
part
of
the
fire
were
hidden
behind
it
even
from
this
high
position
little
could
be
seen
beyond
the
fujinami
enclosure
except
away
down
the
valley
appeared
the
grey
scaly
roofs
of
huddled
houses
and
on
a
hill
opposite
more
trees
with
the
bizarre
pinnacle
of
a
pagoda
forcing
its
way
through
the
midst
of
them
it
looked
like
a
series
of
hats
perched
one
on
the
top
of
the
other
by
a
merchant
of
petticoat
lane
lights
were
glimpsing
from
the
fujinami
mansion
more
lights
were
visible
among
the
shrubberies
below
this
soft
light
filtered
through
the
paper
walls
shone
like
a
luminous
pearl
this
is
the
home
light
of
the
japanese
and
is
as
typical
of
their
domesticity
as
the
blazing
is
of
ours
it
is
greenish
still
and
pure
like
a
beacon
out
of
the
deep
silence
a
bell
tolled
it
was
as
though
an
unseen
hand
had
struck
the
splendour
of
that
metallic
firmament
or
as
though
a
voice
had
spoken
out
of
the
sunset
cloud
the
two
girls
descended
to
the
brink
of
the
lake
here
at
the
farther
end
the
water
was
broader
and
it
was
hidden
from
view
of
the
houses
green
reeds
grew
along
the
margin
and
green
iris
leaves
like
sword
blades
black
now
in
the
failing
light
there
was
a
studied
roughness
in
the
tiny
landscape
and
in
the
midst
of
the
wilderness
a
little
hut
what
a
sweet
little
cried
asako
it
looked
like
a
settler
shack
built
of
rough
unshapen
logs
and
thatched
with
rushes
it
is
the
room
for
the
the
said
her
cousin
inside
the
walls
were
daubed
with
earth
and
a
round
window
barred
with
bamboo
sticks
gave
a
view
into
what
was
apparently
forest
depths
why
it
is
just
like
a
doll
house
cried
asako
delighted
can
we
go
in
oh
yes
said
the
japanese
asako
jumped
in
at
once
and
squatted
down
on
the
clean
matting
but
her
more
cautious
cousin
dusted
the
place
with
her
handkerchief
before
risking
a
stain
do
you
often
have
asked
asako
the
muratas
had
explained
to
her
long
ago
something
about
the
mysterious
rites
two
or
three
times
in
the
spring
and
then
two
or
three
times
in
the
autumn
but
my
teacher
comes
every
week
how
long
have
you
been
learning
asako
wanted
to
know
oh
since
i
was
ten
years
old
about
is
it
so
difficult
then
said
asako
who
had
found
it
comparatively
easy
to
pour
out
a
cup
of
tea
without
clumsiness
sadako
smiled
tolerantly
at
her
cousin
naive
ignorance
of
things
aesthetic
and
intellectual
it
was
as
though
she
had
been
asked
whether
music
or
philosophy
were
difficult
one
can
never
study
too
much
she
said
one
is
always
learning
one
can
never
be
perfect
life
is
short
art
is
long
but
it
is
not
an
art
like
painting
or
playing
the
piano
just
pouring
out
tea
oh
yes
sadako
smiled
again
it
is
much
more
than
that
we
japanese
do
not
think
art
is
just
to
be
able
to
do
things
showing
off
like
art
is
in
the
character
in
the
spirit
and
the
teaches
us
to
make
our
character
full
of
art
by
restraining
everything
ugly
and
common
in
every
movement
in
the
movement
of
our
hands
in
the
position
of
our
feet
in
the
looks
of
our
faces
men
and
women
ought
not
to
sit
and
move
like
animals
but
the
shape
of
their
bodies
and
their
way
of
action
ought
to
express
a
poetry
that
is
the
art
of
the
i
should
like
to
see
it
said
asako
excited
by
her
enthusiasm
though
she
hardly
understood
a
word
of
what
she
had
been
saying
you
ought
to
learn
some
of
it
said
sadako
with
the
zeal
of
a
propagandist
my
teacher
says
and
my
teacher
was
educated
at
the
court
of
the
tokugawa
shogun
that
no
woman
can
have
really
good
manners
if
she
has
not
studied
the
of
course
there
was
nothing
which
asako
would
like
more
than
to
sit
in
this
fascinating
arbour
in
the
warm
days
of
the
coming
summer
and
play
at
with
her
japanese
cousin
she
would
learn
to
speak
japanese
too
and
she
would
help
sadako
with
her
french
and
english
the
two
cousins
worked
out
the
scheme
for
their
future
intimacy
until
the
stars
were
reflected
in
the
lake
and
the
evening
breeze
became
too
cool
for
them
then
they
left
the
little
hermitage
and
continued
their
walk
around
the
garden
they
passed
a
bamboo
grove
whose
huge
plumes
black
in
the
darkness
danced
and
beckoned
like
the
daughters
they
passed
a
little
house
shuttered
like
a
noah
ark
from
which
came
a
monotonous
moaning
sound
as
of
some
one
in
pain
and
the
rhythmic
beat
of
a
wooden
clapper
what
is
that
asked
asako
that
is
my
father
brother
house
but
he
is
illegitimate
brother
he
is
not
of
the
true
family
he
is
a
very
pious
man
he
repeats
the
prayer
to
buddha
ten
thousand
times
every
day
and
he
beats
upon
the
a
kind
of
drum
like
a
fish
which
the
buddhist
priests
use
was
he
at
the
dinner
last
night
asked
asako
oh
no
he
never
goes
out
he
has
not
once
left
that
house
for
ten
years
he
is
perhaps
rather
mad
but
it
is
said
that
he
brings
good
luck
to
the
family
a
little
farther
on
they
passed
two
stone
lanterns
cold
and
blind
like
tombstones
stone
steps
rose
between
them
to
what
in
the
darkness
looked
like
a
large
a
lighted
paper
lantern
hung
in
front
of
it
like
a
great
ripe
fruit
what
is
that
asked
asako
in
the
failing
twilight
this
fairy
garden
was
becoming
more
and
more
wonderful
at
any
moment
she
felt
she
might
meet
the
emperor
himself
in
the
white
robes
of
ancient
days
and
the
black
hat
that
is
a
little
temple
explained
her
cousin
for
inari
sama
at
the
top
of
the
flight
of
steps
asako
distinguished
two
stone
foxes
their
expression
was
hungry
and
malign
they
reminded
her
of
what
she
remembered
the
little
temple
outside
the
yoshiwara
on
the
day
she
had
gone
to
see
the
procession
do
you
say
prayers
there
she
asked
her
companion
no
do
not
answered
the
japanese
but
the
servants
light
the
lamp
every
evening
and
we
believe
it
makes
the
house
lucky
we
japanese
are
very
superstitious
besides
it
looks
pretty
in
the
garden
i
do
like
the
foxes
faces
said
asako
they
look
bad
creatures
they
bad
creatures
was
the
reply
nobody
likes
to
see
a
fox
they
fool
people
then
why
say
prayers
if
they
are
bad
it
is
just
because
they
are
bad
said
sadako
that
we
must
please
them
we
flatter
them
so
that
they
may
not
hurt
us
asako
was
unlearned
in
the
difference
between
religion
and
so
she
did
not
understand
the
full
significance
of
this
remark
but
she
felt
an
unpleasant
reaction
the
first
which
she
had
received
that
day
and
she
thought
to
herself
that
if
she
were
the
mistress
of
that
lovely
garden
she
would
banish
the
stone
foxes
and
risk
their
displeasure
the
two
girls
returned
to
the
house
its
shutters
were
up
and
it
too
had
that
same
appearance
of
a
noah
ark
but
of
a
more
complete
and
expensive
variety
one
little
opening
was
left
in
the
wooden
armature
for
the
girls
to
enter
by
please
come
again
many
many
times
was
cousin
sadako
last
farewell
the
house
of
the
fujinami
is
your
home
geoffrey
was
waiting
for
his
wife
in
the
hall
of
the
hotel
he
was
anxious
at
her
late
return
his
embrace
seemed
to
swallow
her
up
to
the
amusement
of
the
who
had
been
discussing
the
lateness
of
and
the
possibility
of
her
having
an
admirer
thank
goodness
said
geoffrey
what
have
you
been
doing
i
was
just
going
to
organise
a
search
party
i
have
been
with
fujinami
and
sadako
asako
panted
they
would
not
let
me
go
and
oh
she
was
going
to
tell
him
all
about
her
mother
picture
but
she
suddenly
checked
herself
and
said
instead
they
got
such
a
lovely
garden
she
described
the
home
of
the
cousins
in
glowing
colours
the
hospitality
of
the
family
the
cleverness
of
cousin
sadako
and
the
lessons
which
they
were
going
to
exchange
yes
she
replied
to
geoffrey
questions
she
had
seen
the
memorial
tablets
of
her
father
and
mother
and
their
wedding
photograph
but
a
strange
paralysis
sealed
her
lips
and
her
soul
became
inarticulate
she
found
herself
absolutely
incapable
of
telling
that
big
foreign
husband
of
hers
truly
as
she
loved
him
the
veritable
state
of
her
emotions
when
brought
face
to
face
with
her
dead
parents
geoffrey
had
never
spoken
to
her
of
her
mother
he
had
never
seemed
to
have
the
least
interest
in
her
identity
these
jap
women
as
he
called
them
were
never
very
real
to
him
she
dreaded
the
possibility
of
revealing
to
him
her
secret
and
then
of
receiving
no
response
to
her
emotion
also
she
had
an
instinctive
reluctance
to
emphasise
in
geoffrey
mind
her
kinship
with
these
alien
people
after
dinner
when
she
had
gone
up
to
her
room
geoffrey
was
left
alone
with
his
cigar
and
his
reflection
funny
that
she
did
not
speak
more
about
her
father
and
mother
but
i
suppose
they
do
mean
much
to
her
after
all
and
by
jove
it
a
good
thing
for
me
i
would
like
to
have
a
wife
who
was
all
the
time
running
home
to
her
people
and
comparing
notes
with
her
mother
upstairs
in
her
bedroom
asako
had
unrolled
the
precious
an
unmounted
photograph
came
fluttering
out
of
the
parcel
it
was
a
portrait
of
her
father
alone
taken
a
short
time
before
his
death
at
the
back
of
the
photograph
was
some
japanese
writing
is
tanaka
there
asako
asked
her
maid
titine
yes
of
course
tanaka
was
there
in
the
next
room
with
his
ear
near
the
door
tanaka
what
does
this
mean
japanese
poem
he
said
meaning
very
difficult
very
many
meanings
i
think
perhaps
it
means
having
travelled
all
over
the
world
he
feels
very
sad
yes
but
word
for
word
tanaka
what
does
it
mean
this
writing
means
world
is
really
not
the
same
it
says
all
the
world
very
many
tell
lies
and
this
this
means
travelling
everywhere
and
this
at
the
end
it
means
eveything
always
the
same
thing
very
bad
translation
i
make
very
sad
poem
and
this
writing
here
that
is
japanese
name
fujinami
katsundo
and
the
date
year
of
meiji
twelfth
month
tanaka
had
turned
over
the
photograph
and
was
looking
attentively
at
the
portrait
the
honoured
father
of
ladyship
i
think
he
said
yes
said
asako
then
she
thought
she
heard
her
husband
step
away
down
the
corridor
hurriedly
she
thrust
and
photograph
into
a
drawer
now
why
did
she
do
that
wondered

o
standing
at
the
side
of
the
stone
house
when
i
look
at
you
it
is
like
seeing
face
to
face
the
men
of
old
time
for
the
first
time
during
the
journey
of
their
married
lives
geoffrey
and
asako
were
pursuing
different
paths
it
is
the
normal
thing
no
doubt
for
the
man
to
go
out
to
his
work
and
to
his
play
while
the
wife
attends
to
her
social
and
domestic
duties
the
evening
brings
reunion
with
new
impressions
and
new
interests
to
discuss
such
a
life
with
its
brief
restorative
separations
prevents
love
growing
stale
and
soothes
the
irritation
of
nerves
which
by
the
strain
of
petty
repetitions
are
exasperated
sometimes
into
blasphemy
of
the
true
creed
but
the
barrington
was
an
unusual
one
by
adopting
a
life
of
travel
they
had
devoted
themselves
to
a
protracted
honeymoon
a
relentless
so
long
as
they
were
continually
on
the
move
constantly
refreshed
by
new
scenes
they
did
not
feel
the
difficulty
of
their
task
but
directly
their
stay
in
tokyo
seemed
likely
to
become
permanent
their
ways
separated
as
naturally
as
two
branches
which
have
been
tightly
bound
together
spread
apart
with
the
loosening
of
the
string
this
separation
was
so
inevitable
that
they
were
neither
of
them
conscious
of
it
geoffrey
had
all
his
life
been
devoted
to
exercise
and
games
of
all
kinds
they
were
as
necessary
as
food
for
his
big
body
at
tokyo
he
had
found
most
unexpectedly
excellent
and
players
they
still
spent
the
mornings
together
driving
round
the
city
and
inspecting
curios
so
what
could
be
more
reasonable
than
that
asako
should
prefer
to
spend
her
afternoons
with
her
cousin
who
was
so
anxious
to
please
her
and
to
initiate
her
into
that
intimate
japanese
life
which
of
course
must
appeal
to
her
more
strongly
than
to
her
husband
personally
geoffrey
found
the
company
of
his
japanese
relatives
exceedingly
slow
in
return
for
the
hospitalities
of
the
maple
club
the
barringtons
invited
a
representative
gathering
of
the
fujinami
clan
to
dinner
at
the
imperial
hotel
to
be
followed
by
a
general
adjournment
to
the
theatre
it
was
a
most
depressing
meal
nobody
spoke
all
of
the
guests
were
nervous
some
of
them
about
their
clothes
some
about
their
knives
and
forks
all
of
them
about
their
english
they
were
too
nervous
even
to
drink
wine
which
would
have
been
the
only
remedy
for
such
a
frost
only
ito
the
lawyer
talked
talked
noisily
talked
with
his
mouth
full
but
geoffrey
disliked
ito
he
mistrusted
the
man
but
because
of
his
wife
growing
intimacy
with
her
cousins
he
felt
loath
to
start
subterranean
inquiries
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
her
fortune
it
was
ito
who
foreseeing
embarrassment
had
suggested
the
theatre
party
after
dinner
for
this
at
least
geoffrey
was
grateful
to
him
it
saved
him
the
pain
of
trying
to
make
conversation
with
his
cousins
talking
to
these
japs
he
said
to
reggie
forsyth
is
like
trying
to
play
tennis
all
by
yourself
later
on
at
his
wife
insistence
he
attended
an
informal
at
the
fujinami
house
again
he
suffered
acutely
from
those
cruel
silences
and
portentous
waitings
to
which
he
noticed
that
even
the
japanese
among
themselves
were
liable
but
which
apparently
they
did
not
mind
tea
and
were
served
by
girls
who
danced
afterwards
upon
the
lawn
when
this
performance
was
over
the
guests
were
conducted
to
an
open
space
behind
the
where
a
little
had
been
set
up
with
a
target
and
boxes
of
lead
lugs
geoffrey
of
course
joined
in
the
and
won
a
handsome
cigarette
case
inlaid
with
damascene
work
but
he
thought
that
it
was
a
poor
game
nor
did
he
ever
realize
that
this
entertainment
had
been
specially
organized
with
a
view
to
flattering
his
military
and
sporting
tastes
but
the
greatest
disillusionment
was
the
akasaka
garden
geoffrey
was
resigned
to
be
bored
by
everything
else
but
his
wife
had
grown
so
enthusiastic
about
the
beauties
of
the
fujinami
domain
that
he
had
expected
to
walk
straight
into
a
paradise
what
did
he
see
a
dirty
pond
and
some
shrubs
not
one
single
flower
to
break
the
monotony
of
green
and
drab
and
everything
so
small
why
he
could
walk
round
the
whole
enclosure
in
ten
minutes
geoffrey
barrington
was
accustomed
to
country
houses
in
england
with
their
broad
acres
and
their
lavish
luxuriance
of
scent
and
blossom
this
niggling
landscape
art
of
the
japanese
seemed
to
him
mean
and
insignificant
he
much
preferred
the
garden
at
count
saito
home
count
saito
the
late
ambassador
at
the
court
of
james
with
his
stooping
shoulders
his
grizzled
hair
and
his
deep
eyes
peering
under
the
spectacles
had
proposed
the
health
of
captain
and
barrington
at
their
wedding
breakfast
since
then
he
had
returned
to
japan
where
he
was
soon
to
play
a
leading
political
rôle
meeting
geoffrey
one
day
at
the
embassy
he
had
invited
him
and
his
wife
to
visit
his
famous
garden
it
was
a
hanging
garden
on
the
side
of
a
steep
hill
parted
down
the
middle
by
a
little
stream
with
its
string
of
waterfalls
along
either
bank
rose
groups
of
iris
mauve
and
white
whispering
together
like
girls
round
a
sunny
fountain
the
source
of
the
stream
just
below
the
terrace
of
the
count
mansion
they
thronged
together
more
densely
surrounding
the
music
of
the
water
with
the
steps
of
a
slow
sarabande
or
pausing
at
the
edge
of
the
pool
to
admire
their
own
reflection
count
saito
showed
geoffrey
where
the
roses
were
coming
on
new
varieties
of
which
he
had
brought
from
england
with
him
perhaps
they
will
not
like
to
be
turned
into
japanese
he
observed
the
rose
is
such
an
english
flower
they
passed
on
to
where
the
azaleas
would
soon
be
in
fiery
bloom
for
with
the
true
gardener
the
hidden
promise
of
the
morrow
is
more
stimulating
to
the
enthusiasm
than
the
assured
success
of
the
full
flowers
the
count
wore
his
rustling
native
dress
but
two
black
cocker
spaniels
followed
at
his
heels
this
combination
presented
an
odd
mixture
of
english
and
the
of
feudal
japan
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
above
him
rose
the
house
a
tall
italianate
mansion
of
grey
stucco
softened
by
creepers
jessamine
and
climbing
roses
alongside
ran
the
low
irregular
roofs
of
the
japanese
portion
of
the
residence
almost
all
rich
japanese
have
a
double
house
half
foreign
and
half
native
to
meet
the
needs
of
their
amphibious
existence
this
grotesque
juxtaposition
is
to
be
seen
all
over
tokyo
like
a
tall
boastful
foreigner
tethered
to
a
timid
japanese
wife
geoffrey
inquired
in
which
wing
of
this
unequal
bivalve
his
host
actually
lived
when
i
returned
from
england
said
count
saito
i
tried
to
live
again
in
the
japanese
style
but
we
could
not
neither
my
wife
nor
i
we
took
cold
and
rheumatism
sleeping
on
the
floor
and
the
food
made
us
ill
so
we
had
to
give
it
up
but
i
was
sorry
for
i
think
it
is
better
for
a
country
to
keep
its
own
ways
there
is
a
danger
nowadays
when
all
the
world
is
becoming
cosmopolitan
a
kind
of
international
type
is
springing
up
his
language
is
his
writing
is
shorthand
he
has
no
country
he
fights
for
whoever
will
pay
him
most
like
the
swiss
of
the
middle
ages
he
is
the
mercenary
of
commerce
the
ideal
commercial
traveler
i
am
much
afraid
of
him
because
i
am
a
japanese
and
not
a
world
citizen
i
want
my
country
to
be
great
and
respected
above
all
i
want
it
to
be
always
japanese
i
think
that
loss
in
national
character
means
loss
of
national
strength
asako
was
being
introduced
by
her
hostess
to
the
celebrated
collection
of
dwarf
trees
which
had
made
the
social
fame
of
the
count
sojourn
as
ambassador
in
grosvenor
square
countess
saito
like
her
husband
spoke
excellent
english
and
her
manner
in
greeting
asako
was
of
london
rather
than
of
tokyo
she
took
both
her
hands
and
shook
them
warmly
my
dear
she
said
in
her
curious
deep
hoarse
voice
i
so
glad
to
see
you
you
are
like
a
little
bit
of
london
come
to
say
that
you
have
not
forgotten
me
this
great
japanese
lady
was
small
and
very
plain
her
high
forehead
was
deeply
lined
and
her
face
was
marked
with
her
big
mouth
opened
wide
as
she
talked
like
a
nestling
but
she
was
immensely
rich
the
only
child
of
one
of
the
richest
bankers
of
japan
she
had
brought
to
her
husband
the
opportunity
for
his
great
gifts
as
a
political
leader
and
the
luxury
in
which
they
lived
the
little
trees
were
in
evidence
everywhere
decorating
the
living
rooms
posted
like
sentinels
on
the
terrace
and
staged
with
the
honour
due
to
statuary
at
points
of
vantage
in
the
garden
but
their
chief
home
was
in
a
sunny
corner
at
the
back
of
a
shrubbery
where
they
were
aligned
on
shelves
in
the
sunlight
three
special
gardeners
who
attended
to
their
wants
were
grooming
and
massaging
them
soothing
and
titivating
them
for
their
temporary
appearances
in
public
here
they
had
a
of
their
own
kept
slightly
warmed
for
a
few
delicate
specimens
and
also
for
the
convalescence
of
the
hardier
trees
for
these
precious
dwarfs
are
quite
human
in
their
ailments
their
pleasures
and
their
idiosyncracies
countess
saito
had
a
hundred
or
more
of
these
fashionable
pets
of
all
varieties
and
shapes
there
were
giants
of
primeval
forests
reduced
to
the
dimensions
of
a
few
feet
like
the
timbers
of
a
lordly
park
seen
through
the
wrong
end
of
a
telescope
there
were
graceful
maple
trees
whose
tiny
leaves
were
particularly
adapted
to
the
process
of
diminution
which
had
checked
the
growth
of
trunk
and
branches
there
were
weeping
willows
with
feathery
foliage
such
as
sorrowing
fairies
might
plant
on
the
grave
of
some
taliessin
of
oberon
court
there
was
a
double
cherry
in
belated
bloom
its
flowers
of
natural
size
hung
amid
the
slender
branches
like
big
nests
there
was
a
stunted
oak
tree
creeping
along
the
earth
with
gnarled
and
lumpy
limbs
like
a
miniature
dinosaur
it
waved
in
the
air
a
clump
of
demensurate
leaves
with
the
truculent
mien
of
or
lobsters
claws
in
the
centre
of
the
rectangle
formed
by
this
audience
of
trees
and
raised
on
a
long
table
was
a
tiny
wisteria
arbour
formed
by
a
dozen
plants
arranged
in
quincunx
the
intertwisted
ropes
of
branches
were
supported
on
shining
rods
of
bamboo
and
the
clusters
of
blossom
like
bunches
of
grapes
or
like
miniature
chandeliers
still
hung
over
the
litter
of
their
fallen
beauty
with
a
few
flowers
clinging
to
them
pale
and
bleached
they
are
over
two
hundred
years
old
said
their
proud
owner
they
came
from
one
of
the
emperor
palaces
at
kyoto
but
the
pride
of
the
collection
were
the
conifers
and
evergreens
trees
which
have
japanese
and
latin
names
only
the
the
the
the
the
the
and
the
all
trees
of
the
dark
funereal
families
of
fir
and
laurel
which
the
birds
avoid
and
whose
deep
winter
green
in
the
summer
turns
to
rust
there
were
spreading
cedar
trees
black
like
the
tents
of
bedouins
and
there
were
straight
cryptomerias
for
the
masts
of
fairy
ships
there
was
a
strange
tree
whose
foliage
grew
in
round
clumps
like
trays
of
green
lacquer
at
the
extremities
of
twisted
brandies
a
natural
there
were
the
distorted
of
japan
which
are
the
symbol
of
old
age
of
fidelity
of
patience
under
adversity
and
of
the
japanese
nation
itself
in
every
attitude
of
menace
curiosity
jubilation
and
gloom
some
of
them
were
leaning
out
of
their
pots
and
staring
head
downwards
at
the
ground
beneath
them
some
were
creeping
along
the
earth
like
reptiles
some
were
mere
trunks
with
a
bunch
of
green
needles
sprouting
at
the
top
like
a
palm
some
with
one
long
pathetic
branch
were
stretching
out
in
quest
of
the
infinite
to
the
neglect
of
the
rest
of
the
tree
some
were
tall
and
bent
as
by
some
sea
wind
blowing
shoreward
streaking
a
miniature
landscape
they
were
whispering
together
the
tales
of
centuries
past
the
japanese
art
of
cultivating
these
tiny
trees
is
a
weird
and
unhealthy
practice
akin
to
vivisection
but
without
its
excuse
it
is
like
the
chinese
custom
of
dwarfing
their
women
feet
the
result
is
pleasing
to
the
eye
but
it
hurts
the
mind
by
its
abnormality
and
the
heart
by
its
ruthlessness
asako
admiration
so
easily
stirred
became
enthusiastic
as
countess
saito
told
her
something
of
the
personal
history
of
her
favourite
plants
how
this
one
was
two
hundred
years
old
and
that
one
three
hundred
and
fifty
and
how
another
had
been
present
at
such
and
such
a
scene
famous
in
japanese
history
oh
they
are
lovely
cried
asako
where
can
one
get
them
i
must
have
some
countess
saito
gave
her
the
names
of
some
market
gardeners
you
can
get
pretty
little
trees
from
them
for
fifty
to
a
hundred
to
she
said
but
of
course
the
real
historical
trees
are
so
very
few
they
hardly
ever
come
on
the
market
they
are
like
animals
you
know
they
want
so
much
attention
they
must
have
a
garden
to
take
their
walks
in
and
a
valet
of
their
own
this
great
japanese
lady
felt
an
affection
and
sympathy
for
the
girl
who
like
herself
had
been
set
apart
by
destiny
from
the
monotonous
ranks
of
japanese
women
and
their
tedious
dependence
little
asa
chan
she
said
calling
her
by
her
pet
name
take
care
you
can
become
japanese
again
but
your
husband
can
not
of
course
not
he
too
big
laughed
asako
but
i
like
to
run
away
from
him
sometimes
and
hide
behind
the
then
i
feel
independent
but
you
are
not
really
so
said
the
japanese
no
woman
is
you
see
the
wisteria
hanging
in
the
big
tree
there
what
happens
when
the
big
tree
is
taken
away
the
wisteria
becomes
independent
but
it
lies
along
the
ground
and
dies
do
you
know
the
japanese
name
for
wisteria
it
is
fujinami
asako
if
you
have
any
difficulty
ever
come
and
talk
to
me
you
see
i
too
am
a
rich
woman
and
i
know
that
it
is
almost
as
difficult
to
be
very
rich
as
it
is
to
be
very
poor
captain
barrington
and
the
were
sitting
on
one
of
the
benches
of
the
terrace
when
the
ladies
rejoined
them
well
daddy
the
countess
addressed
her
husband
in
english
what
are
you
talking
about
so
earnestly
about
england
and
japan
replied
the
count
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
course
of
a
rambling
conversation
count
saito
had
asked
his
guest
now
what
strikes
you
as
the
most
surprising
difference
between
our
two
countries
geoffrey
pondered
for
a
moment
he
wanted
to
answer
frankly
but
he
was
still
awed
by
the
canons
of
good
form
at
last
he
said
this
yoshiwara
business
the
japanese
statesman
seemed
surprised
but
that
is
just
a
local
difference
in
the
manner
of
regulating
a
universal
problem
he
said
englishmen
are
any
better
than
they
should
be
said
geoffrey
but
we
do
like
to
hear
of
women
put
up
for
sale
like
things
in
a
shop
then
you
have
not
actually
seen
them
yourself
said
the
count
he
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
characteristic
british
habit
of
criticising
on
hearsay
not
actually
but
i
saw
the
procession
last
month
you
really
think
that
it
is
better
to
let
immoral
women
stray
about
the
streets
without
any
attempt
to
control
them
and
the
crime
and
disease
they
cause
it
not
that
said
geoffrey
it
seems
to
me
horrible
that
women
should
be
put
up
to
sale
and
exposed
in
shop
windows
ticketed
and
priced
count
saito
smiled
again
and
said
i
see
that
you
are
an
idealist
like
so
many
englishmen
but
i
am
only
a
practical
statesman
the
problem
of
vice
is
a
problem
of
government
no
law
can
abolish
it
it
is
for
us
statesmen
to
study
how
to
restrain
it
and
its
evil
consequences
three
hundred
years
ago
these
women
used
to
walk
about
the
streets
as
they
do
in
london
tokugawa
iyeyasu
the
greatest
of
all
japanese
statesmen
who
gave
peace
to
the
whole
country
put
in
order
this
untidiness
also
he
had
the
yoshiwara
built
and
he
put
all
the
women
there
where
the
police
could
watch
both
them
and
the
men
who
visited
them
the
english
might
learn
from
us
here
i
think
but
you
are
an
unruly
people
it
is
not
only
that
you
object
for
ideal
reasons
to
the
imprisonment
of
these
women
but
it
is
your
men
who
would
object
very
strongly
to
having
the
eye
of
the
policeman
watching
them
when
they
paid
their
visits
geoffrey
was
silenced
by
the
experience
of
his
host
he
was
afraid
as
most
englishmen
are
of
arguing
that
the
british
determination
to
ignore
vice
however
disastrous
in
practice
is
a
system
infinitely
nobler
in
conception
than
the
acquiescence
which
admits
for
the
evil
its
right
to
exist
and
places
it
among
the
commonplaces
of
life
and
how
about
the
people
who
make
money
out
of
such
a
place
asked
geoffrey
they
must
be
contemptible
specimens
the
face
of
the
wise
statesman
became
suddenly
gentle
i
really
do
know
much
about
them
he
said
if
we
do
meet
them
they
do
not
boast
about
it
chapter
xv
eurasia
ya
ara
omoshiro
no
queer
yes
but
attractive
are
the
flowers
which
bloom
out
of
season
although
he
felt
a
decreasing
interest
in
the
japanese
people
geoffrey
was
enjoying
his
stay
in
tokyo
he
was
tired
of
traveling
and
was
glad
to
settle
down
in
the
semblance
of
a
home
life
he
was
very
keen
on
his
tennis
it
was
also
a
great
pleasure
to
see
so
much
of
reggie
forsyth
besides
he
was
conscious
of
the
mission
assigned
to
him
by
lady
cynthia
cairns
to
save
his
friend
from
the
dangerous
connection
with
yaé
smith
reggie
and
he
had
been
at
eton
together
geoffrey
four
years
the
senior
a
member
of
pop
and
an
athlete
of
many
colours
found
himself
one
day
the
object
of
an
almost
idolatrous
worship
on
the
part
of
a
skinny
little
being
discreditably
clever
at
latin
verses
and
given
over
to
the
degrading
habit
of
solitary
piano
practicing
on
he
was
embarrassed
but
touched
by
a
devotion
which
was
quite
incomprehensible
to
him
and
he
encouraged
it
furtively
when
geoffrey
left
eton
the
friends
did
not
see
each
other
again
for
some
years
though
they
watched
each
other
careers
from
a
distance
mutually
appreciative
their
next
meeting
took
place
in
lady
everington
where
barrington
had
already
heard
fair
ladies
praising
the
gifts
and
graces
of
the
young
diplomat
he
heard
him
play
the
piano
and
he
also
heard
the
appreciation
of
discerning
judgment
he
heard
him
talking
with
arabesque
agility
it
was
geoffrey
turn
to
feel
on
the
wrong
side
of
a
vast
superiority
and
in
his
turn
he
repaid
the
old
debt
of
admiration
generosity
filled
the
gulf
and
the
two
became
firm
friends
reggie
intelligence
flicked
the
inertia
of
geoffrey
mind
quickened
his
powers
of
observation
and
developed
his
sense
of
interest
in
the
world
around
him
geoffrey
prudence
and
stolidity
had
more
than
once
saved
the
young
man
from
the
brink
of
sentimental
precipices
for
reggie
unquestionable
musical
talent
found
its
nourishment
in
love
affairs
dangerously
unsophisticated
he
refused
to
consider
marriage
with
any
of
the
sweet
young
things
who
would
gladly
have
risked
his
lukewarm
interest
for
the
chance
of
becoming
an
ambassador
wife
he
equally
avoided
pawning
his
youth
to
any
of
the
maturer
married
ladies
whose
status
and
character
together
with
those
of
their
husbands
license
them
to
practice
as
certificated
egerias
his
dangerous
was
for
highly
spiced
adventuresses
and
for
pastoral
amourettes
wistful
and
obscure
but
he
never
gave
away
his
heart
he
lent
it
out
at
interest
he
received
it
again
intact
with
the
profit
of
his
musical
inspiration
thus
his
liaison
with
véronique
gerson
produced
the
publication
of
a
series
of
musical
poems
which
placed
him
at
once
in
the
forefront
of
young
composers
but
it
also
alarmed
the
foreign
office
which
was
paternally
interested
in
reggie
career
this
brought
about
his
banishment
to
japan
the
now
famous
is
his
candid
musical
confession
that
the
coma
inflicted
upon
him
by
unconcern
was
merely
the
drowsiness
of
the
waiting
earth
before
the
new
year
brought
back
the
old
story
reggie
would
never
be
attracted
to
native
women
and
he
had
not
the
dry
inquisitiveness
of
his
predecessor
aubrey
laking
which
might
induce
him
to
buy
and
keep
a
woman
for
whom
he
felt
no
affection
the
love
which
can
exchange
no
thoughts
in
speech
was
altogether
too
crude
for
him
it
was
his
emotions
rather
than
his
senses
which
were
always
craving
for
amorous
excitement
his
frail
body
claimed
merely
its
right
to
follow
their
lead
as
a
little
boat
follows
the
strong
wind
which
fills
its
sails
but
ever
since
he
had
loved
geoffrey
barrington
at
eton
it
was
a
necessity
for
his
nature
to
love
some
one
and
as
the
haze
of
his
young
conceptions
cleared
that
some
one
became
necessarily
a
woman
he
soon
recognized
the
wisdom
of
the
foreign
office
in
choosing
japan
it
was
a
starvation
diet
which
had
been
prescribed
for
him
so
he
settled
down
to
his
memories
and
to
thinking
that
it
would
be
two
long
years
or
more
before
his
spring
blossomed
again
then
he
heard
the
story
of
the
duel
fought
for
yaé
smith
by
two
young
english
officers
both
of
them
her
lovers
so
people
said
and
the
vaguer
tale
of
a
fiancé
suicide
some
weeks
later
he
met
her
for
the
first
time
at
a
dance
she
was
the
only
woman
present
in
japanese
dress
and
reggie
thought
at
once
of
asako
barrington
how
wise
of
these
small
women
to
wear
the
kimono
which
drapes
so
gracefully
their
stumpy
figures
he
danced
with
her
his
right
hand
lodged
somewhere
in
the
folds
of
the
huge
bow
with
the
embroidered
peacock
which
covered
her
back
under
this
stiff
brocade
he
could
feel
no
sensation
of
a
living
body
she
seemed
to
have
no
bones
in
her
and
she
was
as
light
as
a
feather
it
was
then
that
he
imagined
her
as
lilith
the
she
danced
with
ease
so
much
better
than
he
that
at
the
end
of
a
series
of
cannons
she
suggested
that
they
might
sit
out
the
dance
she
guided
him
into
the
garden
and
they
took
possession
of
a
rustic
seat
in
the
ballroom
she
had
seemed
timid
and
had
spoken
in
undertones
only
but
in
this
shadowy
beneath
the
stars
she
began
to
talk
frankly
about
her
own
life
she
told
him
about
her
one
visit
to
england
with
her
father
how
she
had
loved
the
country
and
how
dull
it
was
for
her
here
in
japan
she
asked
him
about
his
music
she
would
so
like
to
hear
him
play
there
was
an
old
piano
at
her
home
she
did
not
think
he
would
like
it
very
much
indeed
reggie
was
already
shuddering
in
anticipation
or
else
would
she
come
to
tea
with
him
at
the
embassy
that
would
be
nice
she
could
bring
her
mother
or
one
of
her
brothers
she
would
rather
come
with
a
girl
friend
very
well
on
the
morrow
she
came
reggie
hated
playing
in
public
he
said
that
it
was
like
stripping
naked
before
a
multitude
or
like
having
to
read
one
own
love
letters
aloud
in
a
divorce
court
but
there
is
nothing
more
soothing
than
to
play
to
one
attentive
listener
especially
if
that
listener
be
feminine
and
if
the
interest
shown
be
that
personal
interest
which
with
so
many
women
takes
the
place
of
true
appreciation
and
which
looks
over
the
art
to
the
artist
yaé
came
with
the
girl
friend
a
lean
and
skinny
girl
like
a
gipsy
whom
yaé
patronized
she
came
once
again
with
the
girl
friend
and
then
she
came
alone
reggie
was
relieved
and
said
so
yaé
laughed
and
replied
but
i
brought
her
for
your
own
sake
i
always
go
everywhere
by
myself
then
please
do
take
me
into
consideration
ever
again
answered
reggie
so
those
afternoons
began
which
so
soon
darkened
into
evenings
while
reggie
sat
at
the
piano
playing
his
thoughts
aloud
and
the
girl
lay
on
the
sofa
or
squatted
on
the
big
cushion
by
the
fire
with
cigarettes
within
reach
and
a
glass
of
liqueur
wrapped
in
an
atmosphere
of
laziness
and
such
as
she
had
never
known
before
then
reggie
would
stop
playing
he
would
sit
down
beside
her
or
he
would
take
her
on
his
knee
and
they
would
talk
he
talked
as
poets
talk
weaving
stories
out
of
nothing
finding
laughter
and
tears
in
what
she
would
have
passed
by
unnoticed
she
talked
to
him
about
herself
about
the
daily
doings
of
her
home
its
sadness
and
isolation
since
her
father
died
he
had
been
the
playfellow
of
her
childhood
he
had
never
grudged
his
time
or
his
money
for
her
amusement
she
had
been
brought
up
like
a
little
princess
she
had
been
utterly
spoiled
he
had
transferred
to
her
precocious
mind
his
love
of
excitement
his
inquisitiveness
his
courage
and
his
lack
of
scruple
and
then
when
she
was
sixteen
he
had
died
leaving
as
his
last
command
to
the
japanese
wife
who
would
obey
him
in
death
as
she
had
obeyed
him
living
the
strict
injunction
that
yaé
was
to
have
her
own
way
always
and
in
everything
he
left
a
respectable
fortune
a
japanese
widow
and
two
worthless
sons
poor
yaé
surrounded
by
the
friends
and
amusements
of
an
english
girl
life
the
qualities
of
her
happy
disposition
might
have
borne
their
natural
fruit
but
at
her
father
death
she
found
herself
isolated
without
friends
and
without
amusements
she
found
herself
marooned
on
the
island
of
eurasia
a
flat
and
barren
land
of
narrow
confines
and
stunted
vegetation
the
japanese
have
no
use
for
the
and
the
europeans
look
down
upon
them
they
dwell
apart
in
a
limbo
of
which
baroness
miyazaki
is
the
acknowledged
queen
baroness
miyazaki
is
a
stupendous
old
lady
whose
figure
might
be
drawn
from
some
comedy
her
late
husband
and
gossip
says
that
she
was
his
landlady
during
a
period
of
study
in
england
held
a
high
position
in
the
imperial
court
his
wife
by
a
pomposity
of
manner
and
an
assumption
of
superior
knowledge
succeeded
where
no
other
white
woman
has
succeeded
in
acquiring
the
respect
and
intimacy
of
the
great
ladies
of
japan
she
has
inculcated
the
accents
of
pentonville
with
its
aitches
dropped
and
recovered
again
among
the
high
japanese
aristocracy
but
first
her
husband
died
and
then
the
old
imperial
court
of
the
emperor
meiji
passed
away
so
baroness
miyazaki
had
to
retire
from
the
society
of
princesses
she
passed
not
without
dignity
like
an
old
monarch
to
the
vacant
throne
of
the
eurasian
limbo
where
her
rule
is
undisputed
every
friday
afternoon
you
may
see
her
presiding
over
her
little
court
in
the
miyazaki
mansion
with
its
mixture
of
tinsel
and
dust
the
bourbonian
features
the
lofty
white
wig
the
elephantine
form
the
rustling
taffeta
and
the
ebony
stick
with
its
ivory
handle
leads
one
thoughts
backwards
to
the
days
of
richardson
and
sterne
but
her
loyal
subjects
who
surround
her
it
is
impossible
to
place
them
they
are
poor
they
are
untidy
they
are
restless
their
black
hair
is
straggling
their
brown
eyes
are
soft
their
clothes
are
desperately
european
but
and
tired
they
chatter
together
ceaselessly
and
rapidly
like
starlings
with
curious
inflections
in
their
english
speech
and
phrases
snatched
up
from
the
vernacular
they
are
forever
glancing
and
whispering
bursting
at
times
into
wild
peals
of
laughter
which
lack
the
authentic
ring
of
gladness
they
are
a
people
of
shadows
blown
by
the
harsh
winds
of
destiny
across
the
face
of
a
land
where
they
can
find
no
permanent
resting
place
they
are
the
children
of
eurasia
the
unhappiest
people
on
earth
it
was
among
these
people
that
yaé
lot
was
cast
she
stepped
into
an
immediate
ascendancy
over
them
thanks
to
her
beauty
her
personality
and
above
all
to
her
money
baroness
miyazaki
saw
at
once
that
she
had
a
rival
in
eurasia
she
hated
her
but
waited
calmly
for
the
opportunity
to
assist
in
her
inevitable
collapse
a
woman
of
wide
experience
watching
the
antics
of
a
girl
innocent
and
giddy
the
baroness
playing
the
part
of
elizabeth
of
england
to
yaé
mary
queen
of
scots
meanwhile
yaé
was
learning
what
the
eurasian
girls
were
whispering
about
so
continually
love
affairs
intrigues
with
secretaries
of
south
american
legations
secret
engagements
disguised
messages
this
seed
fell
upon
soil
her
father
had
been
a
reprobate
till
the
day
of
his
death
when
he
had
sent
for
his
favourite
japanese
girl
to
come
and
massage
the
pain
out
of
his
wasted
body
her
brothers
had
one
staple
topic
of
conversation
which
they
did
not
hesitate
to
discuss
before
their
sister
assignation
houses
and
the
licensed
quarters
yaé
mind
was
formed
to
the
idea
that
for
people
there
is
one
absorbing
distraction
which
is
to
be
found
in
the
company
of
the
opposite
sex
there
was
no
talk
in
the
smith
home
of
the
romance
of
marriage
of
the
love
of
parents
and
children
which
might
have
turned
this
precocious
preoccupation
in
a
healthy
direction
the
talk
was
of
women
all
the
time
of
women
as
instruments
of
pleasure
nor
could
smith
the
japanese
mother
guide
her
daughter
steps
she
was
a
creature
of
duty
and
she
did
her
utmost
for
her
children
physical
wants
she
nursed
them
devotedly
in
sickness
she
attended
to
their
clothes
and
to
their
comforts
but
she
did
not
attempt
to
influence
their
moral
ideas
she
had
given
up
any
hope
of
understanding
her
husband
she
schooled
herself
to
accept
everything
without
surprise
poor
man
he
was
a
foreigner
and
had
a
fox
he
was
possessed
and
unfortunately
his
children
had
inherited
this
incorrigible
animal
to
please
her
daughter
she
opened
up
her
house
for
hospitality
with
unseemly
promptitude
after
her
husband
death
the
smiths
gave
frequent
dances
by
young
people
of
the
tokyo
foreign
community
at
the
first
of
these
series
yaé
listened
to
the
passionate
pleadings
of
a
young
man
called
hoskin
a
clerk
in
an
english
firm
on
the
second
opportunity
she
became
engaged
to
him
on
the
third
she
was
struck
with
admiration
and
awe
by
a
south
american
diplomat
with
the
green
ribbon
of
a
bolivian
order
tied
across
his
false
shirt
front
don
quebrado
was
a
practiced
hand
at
seduction
and
yaé
became
one
of
his
victims
soon
after
her
seventeenth
birthday
and
just
ten
days
before
her
admirer
sailed
away
to
rejoin
his
legitimate
spouse
in
guayaquil
the
engagement
with
hoskin
still
lingered
on
but
the
young
man
who
adored
her
was
haggard
and
pale
yaé
had
a
new
follower
a
teacher
of
english
in
a
japanese
school
who
recited
beautifully
and
wrote
poetry
about
her
then
baroness
miyazaki
judged
that
her
time
was
ripe
she
summoned
young
hoskin
into
her
dowager
presence
and
with
a
manner
heavily
maternal
she
warned
him
against
the
lightness
of
his
fiancée
when
he
refused
to
believe
evil
of
her
she
produced
a
pathetic
letter
full
of
which
the
girl
herself
had
written
to
her
in
a
moment
of
expansion
a
week
later
the
young
man
body
was
washed
ashore
near
yokohama
yaé
was
sorry
to
hear
of
the
accident
but
she
had
long
ceased
to
be
interested
in
hoskin
the
reticence
of
whose
passion
had
seemed
like
a
touch
of
ice
to
her
fevered
nerves
but
this
was
baroness
opportunity
to
discredit
yaé
to
crush
her
rival
out
of
serious
competition
and
to
degrade
her
to
the
it
was
done
promptly
and
ruthlessly
for
the
baroness
gossip
carried
weight
throughout
the
diplomatic
professional
and
missionary
circles
even
where
her
person
was
held
in
ridicule
the
facts
of
hoskin
suicide
became
known
nice
women
dropped
yaé
entirely
and
bad
men
ran
after
her
with
redoubled
zest
yaé
did
not
realize
her
ostracism
the
smith
dances
next
winter
became
so
many
competitions
for
the
daughter
corruption
and
were
rendered
brilliant
by
the
presence
of
several
of
the
young
officers
attached
to
the
british
embassy
who
made
the
running
and
finally
monopolized
the
prize
next
year
the
smiths
acquired
a
which
soon
became
special
perquisite
she
would
disappear
for
whole
days
and
nights
none
of
her
family
could
restrain
her
her
answer
to
all
remonstrances
was
you
do
what
you
want
i
do
what
i
want
that
summer
two
english
officers
whom
she
especially
favoured
fought
a
duel
with
pistols
for
her
beauty
or
for
her
honour
the
exact
motive
remained
unknown
one
was
seriously
wounded
and
both
of
them
had
to
leave
the
country
yaé
was
grieved
by
this
sudden
loss
of
both
her
lovers
it
left
her
in
a
condition
of
double
widowhood
from
which
she
was
most
anxious
to
escape
but
now
she
was
becoming
more
fastidious
the
school
teachers
and
the
dagos
fascinated
her
no
longer
her
soldier
friends
had
introduced
her
into
embassy
circles
and
she
wished
to
remain
there
she
fixed
on
aubrey
laking
for
her
next
attempt
but
from
him
she
received
her
first
rebuff
having
lured
him
into
a
as
her
method
was
she
asked
him
for
counsel
in
the
conduct
of
her
life
if
i
were
you
he
said
dryly
i
should
go
to
paris
or
new
york
you
will
find
much
more
scope
there
fortunately
fate
soon
exchanged
aubrey
laking
for
reggie
forsyth
he
was
just
what
suited
her
for
a
time
but
a
certain
impersonality
in
his
admiration
his
fits
of
reverie
the
ascendancy
of
music
over
his
mind
made
her
come
to
regret
her
more
masculine
lovers
and
it
was
just
at
this
moment
of
dissatisfaction
that
she
first
saw
geoffrey
barrington
and
thought
how
lovely
he
would
look
in
his
uniform
from
that
moment
desire
entered
her
heart
not
that
she
wanted
to
lose
reggie
the
peace
and
harmony
of
his
surroundings
soothed
her
like
a
warm
and
scented
bath
but
she
wanted
both
she
had
had
two
before
and
had
found
them
complimentary
to
one
another
and
agreeable
to
her
she
wanted
to
sit
on
geoffrey
knee
and
to
feel
his
strong
arms
round
her
but
she
must
not
be
too
sudden
in
her
advances
or
she
would
lose
him
as
she
had
lost
laking
it
is
easy
to
condemn
yaé
as
a
bad
girl
a
born
yet
such
a
judgment
would
not
be
entirely
equitable
she
was
a
little
creature
a
child
of
the
sun
she
never
sought
to
do
harm
to
anybody
rather
was
she
she
wished
above
all
to
make
her
men
friends
happy
and
to
be
pleasing
in
their
eyes
she
was
never
swayed
by
mercenary
motives
she
was
to
be
won
by
admiration
by
good
looks
and
by
personal
distinction
but
never
by
money
if
she
tired
of
her
lovers
somewhat
rapidly
it
was
as
a
child
tires
of
a
game
or
of
a
book
and
leaves
it
forgotten
to
start
another
she
was
a
child
with
bad
habits
rather
than
a
mature
sinner
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
because
geoffrey
harrington
was
married
he
at
least
ought
to
be
immune
from
her
attack
in
her
dreams
of
an
earthly
paradise
there
was
no
marrying
or
giving
in
marriage
only
the
sweet
mingling
of
breath
the
quickening
of
the
like
the
pulsation
of
her
beloved
the
sound
as
of
violin
arpeggios
rising
higher
and
ever
higher
the
pause
of
the
ecstatic
moment
when
the
sense
of
time
is
lost
and
then
the
return
to
earth
on
lazy
languorous
wings
like
a
floating
motionless
on
a
shoreward
breeze
such
was
yaé
ideal
of
love
and
of
life
too
it
is
not
for
us
to
condemn
yaé
but
rather
should
we
censure
the
blasphemy
of
mixed
marriages
which
has
brought
into
existence
these
thistledown
children
of
a
realm
which
has
no
kings
or
priests
or
laws
or
parliaments
or
duty
or
tradition
or
hope
for
the
future
which
has
not
even
an
acre
of
dry
ground
for
its
heritage
or
any
concrete
symbol
of
its
soul
the
cimmerian
land
of
eurasia
reggie
forsyth
understood
the
pathos
of
the
girl
position
and
being
a
rebel
and
an
anarchist
at
heart
he
readily
condoned
the
faults
which
she
confided
to
him
frankly
gradually
pity
most
dangerous
of
all
counsellors
revealed
her
to
him
as
a
girl
romantically
unfortunate
who
never
had
a
fair
chance
in
life
who
had
been
the
sport
of
bad
men
and
fools
who
needed
only
a
measure
of
true
friendship
and
affection
for
the
natural
sunshine
of
her
disposition
to
scatter
the
rank
vapours
of
her
soul
night
what
reggie
grasped
only
in
that
one
enlightened
moment
when
he
had
christened
her
lamia
was
the
tragic
fact
that
she
had
no
soul

down
how
lovely
is
the

night
before
the
iris
had
quite
faded
and
before
the
azaleas
of
hibiya
were
set
ablaze
in

they
count
the
months
by
the
blossoming

the
flowers
reggie
forsyth
had
deserted
tokyo
for
the
joys
of
sea
bathing
at
kamakura
he
attended
at
the
embassy
for
office
hours
during
the
morning
but
returned
to
the
seaside
directly
after
lunch
this
departure
disarranged
geoffrey
scheme
for
his
friend
salvation
for
he
was
not
prepared
to
go
the
length
of
sacrificing
his
daily
game
of
tennis
what
do
you
want
to
leave
us
for
he
remonstrated
the
bathing
said
reggie
is
heavenly
besides
next
month
i
have
to
go
into
with
my
chief
i
must
prepare
myself
for
the
strain
with
prayer
and
fasting
but
why
do
you
come
down
and
join
us
is
there
any
tennis
asked
geoffrey
there
is
a
court
a
grass
court
with
holes
in
it
but
i
never
seen
anybody
playing
then
what
is
there
to
do
oh
bathing
and
sleeping
and
digging
in
the
sand
and
looking
at
temples
and
bathing
again
and
next
week
there
is
a
dance
well
we
might
come
down
for
that
if
her
ladyship
agrees
how
is
lamia
do
call
her
that
please
she
has
got
a
soul
after
all
but
it
is
rather
a
disobedient
one
it
runs
away
like
a
little
dog
and
goes
for
days
on
end
she
is
in
great
form
we
motor
in
the
moonlight
then
i
think
it
is
quite
time
i
did
come
said
geoffrey
so
the
harringtons
arrived
in
their
sumptuous
car
on
the
afternoon
before
the
dance
of
which
reggie
forsyth
had
spoken
on
the
beach
they
found
him
in
a
blue
sitting
under
an
enormous
paper
umbrella
with
miss
smith
and
the
gipsy
girl
yaé
wore
a
cotton
kimono
of
blue
and
white
and
she
looked
like
a
figurine
from
a
nanking
vase
geoffrey
said
the
young
diplomat
come
into
the
sea
at
once
you
look
thoroughly
dirty
do
you
like
mrs
harrington
i
have
only
paddled
said
asako
when
i
was
a
little
girl
geoffrey
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
the
blue
water
and
the
lazy
curling
waves
in
a
few
minutes
the
two
men
were
walking
down
to
the
sea
edge
geoffrey
laughing
at
reggie
chatter
his
arms
were
akimbo
with
hands
on
the
hips
hips
which
looked
like
the
boles
of
a
mighty
he
touched
the
ground
with
the
elasticity
of
mercury
he
pushed
through
the
air
with
the
shoulders
of
hercules
the
line
of
his
back
was
pliant
as
a
steel
blade
in
his
hair
the
sun
reflection
shone
like
wires
of
gold
the
gods
were
come
down
in
the
semblance
of
men
yaé
did
not
repress
a
sharp
intake
of
her
breath
and
she
squeezed
the
hand
of
the
gipsy
girl
as
if
pain
had
gripped
her
how
big
your
husband
is
she
said
to
asako
what
a
splendid
man
asako
thought
of
her
husband
as
dear
old
geoffrey
she
never
criticized
his
points
nor
did
she
think
that
yaé
admiration
was
in
very
good
taste
however
she
accepted
it
as
a
clumsy
compliment
from
an
uneducated
girl
who
knew
no
better
the
gipsy
companion
watched
with
a
peculiar
smile
she
understood
the
range
of
yaé
admiration
is
it
a
pity
they
have
to
wear
bathing
dress
miss
smith
went
on
it
so
ugly
look
at
the
japanese
farther
along
the
beach
some
japanese
men
were
bathing
they
threw
their
clothes
down
on
the
sand
and
ran
into
the
water
with
nothing
on
their
bodies
except
a
strip
of
white
cotton
knotted
round
the
loins
they
dashed
into
the
sea
with
their
arms
lifted
above
their
head
shouting
wildly
like
savage
devotees
calling
upon
their
gods
the
sea
sparkled
like
silver
round
their
tawny
skin
their
torsos
were
well
formed
and
hardy
their
dwarfed
and
legs
were
hidden
by
the
waves
certainly
they
presented
an
artistic
contrast
with
the
sodden
blue
of
the
foreigners
bathing
suits
but
asako
brought
up
to
the
strict
ideals
of
convent
modesty
said
i
think
it
disgusting
the
police
ought
to
stop
those
people
bathing
with
no
clothes
on
the
dust
and
sun
of
the
motor
ride
the
constant
anxiety
lest
they
might
run
over
some
doddering
old
woman
or
some
heedless
child
had
given
her
a
headache
as
soon
as
geoffrey
returned
from
his
dip
she
announced
that
she
would
go
back
to
her
room
as
the
headache
continued
she
abandoned
the
idea
of
dancing
she
would
go
to
bed
and
listen
to
the
music
in
the
distance
geoffrey
wished
to
stay
with
her
but
she
would
not
hear
of
it
she
knew
that
her
husband
was
fond
of
dancing
she
thought
that
the
change
and
the
brightness
would
be
good
for
him
do
flirt
with
yaé
smith
she
smiled
as
he
gave
her
the
last
kiss
or
reggie
will
be
jealous
at
first
geoffrey
was
bored
he
did
not
know
many
of
the
dancers
business
people
from
yokohama
most
of
them
or
strangers
stopping
at
the
hotel
their
appearance
depressed
him
the
women
had
hard
faces
the
lustre
was
gone
from
their
hair
they
wore
dresses
without
style
or
charm
the
men
were
gross
and
plethoric
the
music
was
appalling
it
was
produced
out
of
a
piano
a
cello
and
a
violin
driven
by
three
japanese
who
cared
nothing
for
time
or
tune
each
dance
evidently
was
timed
to
last
ten
minutes
at
the
end
of
the
ten
minutes
the
music
stopped
without
finishing
the
phrase
or
even
the
bar
and
the
movement
of
the
dancers
was
jerked
into
stability
reggie
entered
the
room
with
yaé
smith
his
manner
was
unusually
excited
and
elate
hello
geoffrey
enjoying
yourself
no
said
geoffrey
my
wife
has
got
a
headache
and
that
music
is
simply
awful
come
and
have
a
drink
proposed
reggie
he
took
them
aside
into
the
bar
and
ordered
champagne
this
is
to
drink
our
own
healths
he
announced
and
many
years
of
happiness
to
all
of
us
it
is
also
geoffrey
to
drive
away
your
english
spleen
and
to
make
you
into
an
agreeable
into
whose
hands
i
may
commend
this
young
lady
because
you
can
dance
and
i
can
not
my
evening
is
complete
this
is
my
he
led
them
back
to
the
ballroom
then
with
a
low
bow
and
a
flourish
of
an
imaginary
he
disappeared
geoffrey
and
yaé
danced
together
then
they
sat
out
a
dance
and
then
they
danced
again
yaé
was
tiny
but
she
danced
well
and
geoffrey
was
used
to
a
small
partner
for
yaé
it
was
sheer
delight
to
feel
the
size
and
strength
of
this
giant
man
bending
over
her
like
a
sheltering
tree
and
then
to
be
lifted
almost
in
his
arms
and
to
float
on
tiptoe
over
the
floor
with
the
delightful
airiness
of
dreams
what
strange
orgies
our
dances
are
to
the
critical
mind
what
a
strange
contradiction
to
our
sheepish
conventions
a
survival
of
the
corroboree
of
the
immolation
of
the
tribal
virgins
a
ritual
handed
down
from
darkest
antiquity
like
the
cult
of
the
christmas
tree
and
the
easter
egg
only
their
significance
is
lost
while
that
of
the
dance
is
transparently
evident
maidens
as
chaste
as
artemis
wives
as
loyal
as
lucretia
pass
into
the
arms
of
men
who
are
scarcely
known
to
them
with
touchings
of
hands
and
legs
with
crossings
of
breath
to
the
sound
of
music
aphrodisiac
or
fescennine
the
japanese
consider
not
unreasonably
that
our
dancing
is
disgusting
a
nice
girl
no
doubt
and
a
nice
man
too
thinks
of
a
dance
as
a
graceful
exercise
or
as
a
game
like
tennis
or
hockey
but
yaé
was
not
a
nice
girl
and
when
the
music
stopped
with
its
hideous
abruptness
it
awoke
her
from
a
kind
of
trance
in
which
she
had
been
lost
to
all
sensations
except
the
grip
of
geoffrey
hand
and
arm
the
stooping
of
his
shadow
above
her
and
the
tingling
of
her
own
desire
geoffrey
left
his
partner
at
the
end
of
their
second
dance
he
went
upstairs
to
see
his
wife
he
found
her
sleeping
peacefully
so
he
returned
to
the
ballroom
again
he
looked
in
at
the
bar
and
drank
another
glass
of
champagne
he
was
beginning
to
enjoy
himself
he
could
not
find
yaé
so
he
danced
with
the
gipsy
girl
who
had
a
stride
like
a
kangaroo
then
yaé
reappeared
they
had
two
more
dances
together
and
another
glass
of
champagne
the
night
was
fine
there
was
a
bright
moonlight
geoffrey
remarked
that
it
was
jolly
hot
for
dancing
yaé
suggested
a
stroll
along
the
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
standing
together
on
the
beach
oh
look
at
the
bonfires
cried
yaé
a
few
hundred
yards
down
the
where
the
black
shadows
of
the
native
houses
overhung
the
beach
the
lighted
windows
gleamed
softly
like
flakes
of
mica
the
fishermen
were
burning
seaweed
and
jetsam
for
ashes
which
would
be
used
as
fertilizer
tongues
of
fire
were
flickering
skywards
it
was
a
blue
night
the
sky
was
deep
blue
and
the
sea
an
oily
greenish
blue
blue
flames
of
salt
danced
and
vanished
over
the
blazing
heaps
the
savage
figures
squatting
round
the
fires
were
dressed
in
tunics
of
dark
blue
cloth
their
legs
were
bare
their
healthy
faces
lit
up
by
the
blaze
were
the
color
of
ripe
apricots
their
attitudes
and
movements
were
those
of
apes
the
elder
men
were
chattering
together
the
younger
ones
were
gazing
into
the
fire
with
an
expression
of
healthy
stupor
a
boat
was
coming
in
from
the
sea
a
ruby
light
hung
at
the
prow
it
was
rowed
by
four
men
standing
and
two
in
the
stern
and
two
at
the
bow
they
were
intoning
a
rhythmic
chant
to
which
their
bodies
moved
the
boat
was
slim
and
pointed
and
the
rowers
looked
like
vikings
the
shadows
cast
by
the
moonlight
were
inky
black
the
shadows
of
the
beaked
ships
the
shadows
of
the
savage
huts
of
the
men
of
the
huge
round
like
immense
far
out
from
land
where
the
wide
floating
nets
were
spread
lights
were
scattered
like
constellations
the
foreland
was
clearly
visible
with
the
high
woods
which
clothed
its
summit
but
the
farther
end
of
the
beach
faded
into
an
uneven
string
of
lights
soft
and
spectral
as
warmth
rose
from
the
sleeping
earth
and
a
breeze
blew
in
from
the
sea
making
a
strange
metallic
rustling
which
to
japanese
ears
is
the
sweetest
natural
music
in
the
gaunt
sloping
whose
height
in
the
was
exaggerated
to
monstrous
and
threatening
proportions
geoffrey
felt
a
little
hand
in
his
warm
and
moist
shall
we
go
and
see
said
yaé
geoffrey
had
no
idea
who
might
be
but
he
gladly
agreed
she
fluttered
on
beside
him
with
her
long
kimono
sleeves
like
a
big
moth
geoffrey
head
was
full
of
wine
and
waltz
tunes
they
dived
into
a
narrow
street
with
dwellings
on
each
side
some
of
the
houses
were
shuttered
and
silent
others
were
open
to
the
street
with
a
completeness
of
detail
denied
by
our
stingy
women
sitting
up
late
over
their
needlework
men
talking
round
the
firebox
shopkeepers
adding
up
their
accounts
fishermen
mending
their
tackle
the
street
led
inland
towards
abrupt
hills
which
looked
like
a
wall
of
darkness
it
was
lit
by
the
round
street
lamps
the
luminous
globules
with
chinese
letters
on
them
which
had
pleased
geoffrey
first
at
nagasaki
the
road
entered
a
gorge
between
two
precipices
the
kind
of
cleft
into
which
the
children
of
hamlin
had
followed
the
pied
piper
i
would
not
like
to
come
here
alone
said
yaé
clinging
tighter
it
looks
peaceful
enough
said
geoffrey
there
is
a
little
temple
just
to
the
left
where
a
nun
was
murdered
by
a
priest
only
last
year
he
chopped
her
with
a
kitchen
knife
what
did
he
do
it
for
asked
geoffrey
he
loved
her
and
she
would
not
listen
to
him
so
he
killed
her
i
think
i
would
feel
like
that
if
i
were
a
man
they
passed
under
an
enormous
gateway
like
a
huge
barn
door
with
no
barn
behind
it
two
threatening
gods
stood
sentinel
on
either
hand
under
the
influence
of
the
moonlight
the
carved
figures
seemed
to
move
yaé
led
her
big
companion
along
a
path
between
a
pollarded
avenue
geoffrey
still
did
not
know
what
they
had
come
so
far
to
see
nor
did
he
care
everything
was
so
dreamy
and
so
sweet
the
path
turned
and
suddenly
straight
in
front
of
them
they
saw
the
god
the
great
buddha
the
immense
bronze
statue
which
has
survived
from
the
days
of
kamakura
sovereignty
the
bowed
head
and
the
broad
shoulders
were
outlined
against
the
blue
and
starry
sky
against
the
shadow
of
the
woods
the
body
almost
invisible
could
be
dimly
divined
the
moonlight
fell
on
the
calm
smile
and
on
the
hands
palm
upwards
in
the
lap
with
and
touching
in
the
attitude
of
meditation
that
ineffably
peaceful
smiling
face
seemed
to
look
down
from
the
very
height
of
heaven
upon
geoffrey
barrington
and
yaé
smith
the
presence
of
the
god
filled
the
valley
patient
and
powerful
the
creator
of
the
universe
and
the
maintainer
of
life
geoffrey
had
never
seen
anything
so
impressive
he
stooped
down
towards
his
little
companion
listening
for
a
response
to
his
own
emotion
it
came
before
he
could
realize
what
was
happening
he
felt
the
soft
kimono
sleeves
like
wings
round
his
neck
and
the
burning
mouth
pressing
his
lips
oh
geoffrey
she
whispered
he
sat
down
on
a
low
table
in
front
of
a
shuttered
refreshment
bar
with
yaé
on
his
knee
his
strong
arm
round
her
even
as
she
had
dreamed
the
buddha
of
infinite
understanding
smiled
down
upon
them
geoffrey
was
too
little
of
a
prig
to
scold
the
girl
and
too
much
of
a
man
not
to
be
touched
and
flattered
by
the
sincerity
of
her
embrace
he
was
too
much
of
an
englishman
to
ascribe
it
to
its
real
passionate
motive
and
to
profit
by
the
opportunity
instead
he
told
himself
that
she
was
only
a
child
excited
by
the
beauty
and
the
romance
of
the
night
even
as
he
was
he
did
not
begin
to
realize
that
he
or
she
were
making
love
so
he
took
her
on
his
knee
and
stroked
her
hand
is
he
fine
he
said
looking
up
at
the
god
she
started
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
and
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
again
oh
geoffrey
she
murmured
how
strong
you
are
he
stood
up
laughing
with
the
girl
in
his
arms
if
it
was
for
your
big
he
said
you
would
weigh
nothing
at
all
now
hold
tight
for
i
am
going
to
carry
you
home
he
started
down
the
avenue
with
a
swinging
stride
yaé
could
watch
almost
within
range
of
her
lips
the
powerful
profile
of
his
big
face
a
soldier
face
trained
to
command
strong
men
and
to
be
gentle
to
women
and
children
there
was
a
delicious
fragrance
about
him
the
dry
heathery
smell
of
clean
men
he
did
not
look
down
at
her
he
was
staring
into
the
black
shadows
ahead
his
mind
still
full
of
that
sudden
vision
of
buddha
amitabha
he
was
scarcely
thinking
of
the
girl
who
clung
tightly
to
his
neck
yaé
had
no
interest
in
the
except
as
a
grand
background
for
a
good
excuse
for
hand
squeezings
and
ecstatic
movements
she
had
tried
it
once
before
with
her
lover
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
geoffrey
was
in
any
way
different
from
her
other
admirers
she
thought
that
she
herself
was
the
sole
cause
of
his
emotion
and
that
his
fixed
expression
as
he
strode
in
the
darkness
was
an
indication
of
his
passion
and
a
compliment
to
her
charms
she
was
too
tactful
to
say
anything
or
to
try
to
force
the
situation
but
she
felt
disappointed
when
at
the
approach
of
lighted
houses
he
put
her
down
without
further
caresses
in
silence
they
returned
to
the
hotel
where
a
few
tired
couples
were
still
revolving
to
a
spasmodic
music
geoffrey
was
weary
now
and
the
enchantment
of
the
wine
had
passed
away
yaé
he
said
she
was
holding
the
lapels
of
his
coat
and
she
would
have
dearly
loved
to
kiss
him
again
but
he
stood
like
a
tower
without
any
sign
of
bending
down
to
her
and
she
would
have
had
to
jump
for
the
forbidden
fruit
geoffrey
she
purred
i
will
never
forget
it
was
lovely
said
the
englishman
thinking
of
the
great
buddha
geoffrey
retired
to
his
room
where
asako
was
sleeping
peacefully
he
was
very
english
only
the
first
surprise
of
the
girl
kiss
had
startled
his
loyalty
with
the
obtuseness
which
our
continental
neighbours
call
our
hypocrisy
he
buried
his
head
in
his
principles
as
asako
husband
he
could
not
flirt
with
another
woman
as
reggie
friend
he
would
not
flirt
with
reggie
sweetheart
as
an
honourable
man
he
would
not
trifle
with
the
affections
of
a
girl
who
meant
nothing
whatever
to
him
therefore
the
incident
of
the
great
buddha
had
no
significance
therefore
he
could
lie
down
and
sleep
with
a
light
heart
geoffrey
had
been
sleeping
for
half
an
hour
or
so
when
he
was
awakened
by
a
sudden
jolt
as
though
the
whole
building
had
met
with
a
violent
collision
or
as
though
a
gigantic
fist
had
struck
it
everything
in
the
room
was
in
vibration
the
hanging
lamp
was
swinging
like
a
pendulum
the
pictures
were
shaking
on
the
walls
a
china
ornament
on
the
mantelpiece
reeled
and
fell
with
a
crash
geoffrey
leapt
out
of
bed
to
cross
to
where
his
wife
was
sleeping
even
the
floor
was
unsteady
like
a
ship
deck
geoffrey
geoffrey
asako
called
out
it
must
be
an
earthquake
her
husband
gasped
reggie
told
me
to
expect
one
it
has
made
me
feel
so
sick
said
asako
the
disturbance
was
subsiding
only
the
lamp
was
still
oscillating
slightly
to
prove
that
the
earthquake
was
not
merely
a
nightmare
is
any
one
about
asked
asako
geoffrey
went
out
on
to
the
veranda
the
hotel
having
survived
many
hundreds
of
earthquake
shocks
seemed
unaware
of
what
had
happened
far
out
to
sea
puffs
of
fire
were
dimly
seen
like
the
flashes
of
a
battleship
in
action
where
the
island
volcano
of
oshima
was
emptying
its
wrath
against
the
sky
there
were
hidden
and
unfamiliar
powers
in
this
strange
country
of
which
geoffrey
and
asako
had
not
yet
taken
account
beneath
a
tall
on
the
lawn
round
whose
smooth
waxy
light
scores
of
moths
were
flitting
stood
the
short
stout
figure
of
a
japanese
staring
up
at
the
hotel
it
looks
like
tanaka
thought
geoffrey
by
jove
it
tanaka
they
had
definitely
left
their
guide
behind
in
tokyo
had
asako
yielded
at
the
last
moment
unable
to
dispense
with
her
faithful
squire
or
had
he
come
of
his
own
accord
and
if
so
why
these
japs
were
an
unfathomable
and
exasperating
people
sure
enough
next
morning
it
was
tanaka
who
brought
the
early
tea
hello
said
geoffrey
i
thought
you
were
in
tokyo
indeed
grinned
the
guide
i
am
sorry
for
you
perhaps
i
have
commit
great
crime
so
to
come
but
i
think
and
i
think
ladyship
not
so
well
heart
very
anxious
go
to
theatre
wish
to
make
merry
but
all
the
time
heart
very
sad
i
think
i
will
take
last
train
i
will
turn
like
bad
penny
perhaps
lordship
is
angry
no
not
angry
tanaka
just
helpless
there
was
an
earthquake
last
night
not
so
bad
every
twenty
thirty
years
one
very
big
come
last
big
gifu
twenty
years
before
many
thousand
people
killed
japanese
people
say
that
beneath
the
earth
is
one
big
fish
when
the
fish
move
the
earth
shake
silly
fabulous
myth
tanaka
say
is
the
will
of
god
the
little
man
crossed
himself
devoutly
a
few
minutes
later
there
was
a
loud
banging
at
the
door
followed
by
reggie
voice
shouting
are
you
coming
down
for
a
bath
earthquakes
are
horrible
things
commented
reggie
on
their
way
to
the
sea
foreigners
are
supposed
always
to
sleep
through
their
first
one
their
second
they
find
an
interesting
experience
but
the
third
and
the
fourth
and
the
rest
are
a
series
of
nervous
shocks
in
increasing
progression
it
is
like
feeling
god
but
a
wicked
cruel
god
no
wonder
the
japanese
are
so
fatalistic
and
so
desperate
it
is
a
case
of
and
drink
for
ye
die
the
morning
sea
was
cold
and
bracing
the
two
friends
did
not
remain
in
for
long
when
they
were
dried
and
dressed
again
and
when
geoffrey
was
for
returning
to
breakfast
reggie
held
him
back
come
and
walk
by
the
sea
he
said
i
have
something
to
tell
you
they
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
fishing
village
where
geoffrey
and
yaé
had
walked
together
only
a
few
hours
ago
but
the
fires
were
quenched
black
circles
of
charred
ashes
remained
and
the
magic
world
of
the
moonlight
had
become
a
cluster
of
sordid
hovels
where
dirty
women
were
sweeping
their
frowsty
floors
and
scrofulous
children
were
playing
among
stale
bedding
did
you
notice
anything
unusual
in
my
manner
last
night
reggie
began
very
seriously
no
laughed
geoffrey
you
seemed
rather
excited
but
why
did
you
leave
so
early
for
various
reasons
said
his
friend
first
i
hate
dancing
but
i
feel
rather
envious
of
people
who
like
it
secondly
i
wanted
to
be
alone
with
my
own
sensations
thirdly
i
wanted
you
my
best
friend
to
have
every
opportunity
of
observing
yaé
and
forming
an
opinion
about
her
but
why
geoffrey
began
because
it
would
now
be
too
late
for
me
to
take
your
advice
said
reggie
mysteriously
what
do
you
mean
barrington
asked
last
night
i
asked
yaé
to
marry
me
and
i
understand
that
she
accepted
geoffrey
sat
in
the
sunlight
on
the
gunwale
of
a
you
ca
do
that
he
said
oh
geoffrey
i
was
afraid
you
say
it
and
you
have
said
his
friend
half
laughing
why
not
your
career
old
chap
my
career
snorted
reggie
protocol
protocol
and
protocol
i
am
fed
up
with
that
anyway
can
you
imagine
me
a
excellency
worked
by
wires
from
london
babbling
platitudes
over
teacups
to
other
old
excellencies
and
giving
out
a
lot
of
gas
for
the
every
morning
no
in
the
old
days
there
was
charm
and
power
and
splendour
when
an
ambassador
was
really
plenipotentiary
and
peace
and
war
turned
upon
a
court
intrigue
all
that
is
as
dead
as
louis
quatorze
personality
has
faded
out
of
politics
everything
is
business
now
concessions
vested
interests
dividends
and
these
diplomats
are
not
real
people
at
all
they
are
shadowy
survivals
of
the
wraiths
of
talleyrand
or
else
just
restless
bagmen
i
do
call
that
a
career
geoffrey
had
listened
to
these
tirades
before
it
was
reggie
froth
but
what
do
you
propose
doing
he
asked
doing
why
my
music
of
course
before
i
left
england
some
people
offered
me
seventy
pounds
a
week
to
do
stunts
for
them
their
first
offer
was
two
hundred
and
fifty
because
they
were
under
the
illusion
that
i
had
a
title
my
official
salary
at
this
moment
is
two
hundred
so
you
see
there
would
be
no
financial
loss
then
are
you
giving
up
diplomacy
because
you
are
fed
up
with
it
or
for
yaé
smith
sake
i
do
quite
understand
said
geoffrey
he
was
still
pondering
over
the
scene
of
last
evening
and
he
found
considerable
comfort
in
ascribing
yaé
behaviour
to
excitement
caused
by
her
engagement
yaé
is
the
immediate
reason
utter
is
the
original
cause
replied
reggie
do
you
feel
that
you
are
very
much
in
love
with
her
asked
his
friend
the
young
man
considered
for
a
moment
and
then
answered
no
not
in
love
exactly
but
she
represents
what
i
have
come
to
desire
i
get
so
terribly
lonely
geoffrey
and
i
must
have
some
one
some
woman
of
course
and
i
hate
intrigue
and
adultery
yaé
never
grates
upon
me
i
hate
the
twaddling
activities
of
our
modern
women
their
little
sports
their
little
sciences
their
little
earnestnesses
their
little
philanthropies
their
little
imitations
of
men
ways
i
like
the
seraglio
type
of
woman
lazy
and
vain
a
little
more
than
a
lovely
animal
i
can
play
with
her
and
hear
her
purring
she
must
have
no
father
or
mother
or
brothers
or
sisters
or
any
social
scheme
to
entangle
me
in
she
must
have
no
claim
on
my
secret
mind
she
must
not
be
jealous
of
my
music
or
expect
explanations
still
less
explain
me
to
others
a
wife
who
shows
one
round
like
a
monkey
what
horror
but
reggie
old
chap
does
she
love
you
geoffrey
ideas
were
stereotyped
to
his
mind
only
great
love
on
both
sides
could
excuse
so
bizarre
a
marriage
love
cried
reggie
what
is
love
i
can
feel
love
in
music
i
can
feel
it
in
poetry
i
can
see
it
in
sunshine
in
the
wet
woods
and
in
the
phosphorescent
sea
but
in
actual
life
i
think
of
things
in
too
abstract
a
way
ever
to
feel
in
love
with
anybody
so
i
do
think
anybody
could
really
fall
in
love
with
me
it
is
like
religious
faith
i
have
no
faith
and
yet
i
believe
in
faith
i
have
no
love
and
yet
i
have
a
great
love
for
love
blessed
are
they
who
have
not
seen
and
yet
have
believed
when
reggie
was
in
this
mood
geoffrey
despaired
of
getting
any
sense
out
of
him
and
he
felt
that
the
occasion
was
too
serious
for
smiles
they
were
walking
back
to
the
hotel
in
the
direction
of
breakfast
reggie
are
you
quite
sure
said
his
friend
solemnly
no
of
course
i
not
i
never
could
be
and
are
you
intending
to
get
married
soon
not
immediately
no
and
all
this
is
quite
in
confidence
please
i
glad
there
no
hurry
grunted
geoffrey
he
knew
that
the
girl
was
light
and
worthless
but
to
have
shown
reggie
his
proofs
would
have
been
to
admit
his
own
complicity
and
to
give
a
woman
away
so
callously
would
be
a
greater
offence
against
good
form
than
his
momentary
and
meaningless
trespass
but
there
is
one
thing
you
have
forgotten
said
reggie
rather
bitterly
what
that
old
chap
when
a
fellow
announces
his
engagement
to
the
dearest
little
girl
in
all
the
world
his
friends
offer
their
congratulations
it
good
form
he
added
maliciously
chapter

season

last
night
i
awake
and
i
am
still
alive
geoffrey
barrington
tried
not
to
worry
about
yaé
smith
and
of
course
he
did
not
mention
the
episode
of
the
great
buddha
either
to
his
wife
or
to
reggie
forsyth
he
did
not
exactly
feel
ashamed
of
the
incident
but
he
realised
that
it
was
open
to
misinterpretation
he
certainly
had
no
love
for
yaé
and
she
since
she
was
engaged
to
his
friend
presumably
had
no
love
for
him
there
are
certain
unnatural
states
of
mind
in
which
we
are
not
altogether
morally
responsible
beings
among
these
may
be
numbered
the
ballroom
mood
which
drives
quite
sane
people
to
act
madly
the
music
the
wine
the
giddy
turning
the
display
of
women
charms
and
the
confusing
proximity
of
them
produce
an
unwonted
atmosphere
of
which
we
have
most
of
us
been
aware
so
bewildering
that
admiration
of
one
woman
will
drive
sane
men
to
kiss
another
explanation
is
of
course
impossible
and
circumstances
must
have
their
way
scheming
people
mothers
with
daughters
to
marry
study
the
effects
of
this
psychical
chemistry
and
profit
by
their
knowledge
under
similar
influences
geoffrey
himself
had
been
guilty
of
wilder
indiscretions
than
the
kissing
of
a
girl
but
when
he
thought
the
matter
over
he
was
sorry
that
it
had
occurred
and
he
was
profoundly
thankful
that
nobody
had
seen
him
somebody
had
seen
him
however
the
faithful
tanaka
who
had
been
charged
by
ito
the
fujinami
lawyer
not
to
let
his
master
out
of
his
sight
had
followed
him
at
a
discreet
distance
during
the
whole
of
that
midnight
stroll
he
had
observed
the
talk
and
the
attitudes
the
silences
and
the
holding
of
hands
the
glad
exchange
of
kisses
the
sitting
of
yaé
on
knees
and
her
triumphant
return
carried
in
his
arms
to
the
japanese
mind
such
conduct
could
only
mean
one
thing
the
japanese
male
is
frankly
animal
where
women
are
concerned
he
does
not
understand
our
fine
shades
of
which
give
to
our
the
thrill
of
surprise
and
the
palliation
of
romance
tanaka
concluded
that
there
could
be
only
one
termination
to
the
scene
which
he
had
witnessed
he
also
learned
that
yaé
smith
was
reggie
forsyth
mistress
that
he
visited
her
room
at
night
that
she
was
a
girl
of
no
character
at
all
that
she
had
frequently
stopped
at
the
kamakura
hotel
with
other
men
all
of
them
her
lovers
all
this
information
tanaka
collected
with
a
wealth
and
precision
of
detail
which
is
only
possible
in
japan
where
the
espionage
habit
is
so
deeply
implanted
in
the
life
of
the
people
ito
could
scarcely
believe
such
welcome
tidings
the
barrington
had
seemed
to
him
so
devoted
that
he
had
often
despaired
of
his
boast
to
his
patron
that
he
would
divide
the
wife
from
her
husband
and
restore
her
to
her
family
now
if
tanaka
story
were
true
his
task
would
be
child
play
a
woman
charged
with
jealousy
becomes
like
a
weapon
primed
and
cocked
if
ito
could
succeed
in
making
asako
jealous
then
he
knew
that
any
stray
spark
of
misunderstanding
would
blast
a
black
gulf
between
husband
and
wife
and
might
even
blow
the
importunate
englishman
back
to
his
own
country
alone
the
lawyer
explained
his
plan
to
the
head
of
the
family
who
appreciated
its
classic
simplicity
sadako
was
given
to
understand
the
part
which
she
was
to
play
in
alienating
her
cousin
affections
from
the
foreigner
she
was
to
harp
on
the
faithlessness
of
men
in
general
and
on
husbands
in
particular
and
on
the
importance
of
money
values
in
matrimonial
considerations
she
was
to
suggest
that
a
foreign
man
would
never
choose
a
japanese
bride
merely
for
love
of
her
then
when
the
psychological
moment
had
struck
the
name
of
yaé
smith
was
to
be
flashed
into
asako
mind
with
a
blinding
glare
asako
had
been
visiting
her
japanese
cousins
almost
every
day
her
conversation
lessons
were
progressing
rapidly
for
the
first
stages
of
the
language
are
easy
the
new
life
appealed
to
asako
love
of
novelty
and
the
strangeness
of
it
to
her
child
love
of
the
summoning
of
her
parents
spirits
awakened
in
her
the
desire
for
a
home
which
lurks
in
every
one
of
us
the
love
of
old
family
things
around
us
the
sense
of
an
inheritance
and
a
tradition
she
was
tired
of
hotel
life
and
she
turned
for
relaxation
to
playing
at
japan
with
cousin
sadako
just
as
her
husband
turned
to
tennis
her
favourite
haunt
was
the
little
among
the
reeds
at
the
edge
of
the
lake
which
seemed
so
hidden
from
everywhere
here
the
two
girls
practised
their
languages
here
they
tried
on
each
others
clothes
and
talked
about
their
lives
and
purposes
sadako
was
intellectually
the
cleverer
of
the
two
but
asako
had
seen
and
heard
more
so
they
were
fairly
equally
matched
often
the
cousins
shocked
each
other
sense
of
propriety
asako
had
already
observed
that
to
the
japanese
mind
the
immediate
corollary
to
being
married
is
to
produce
children
as
promptly
and
as
rapidly
as
possible
already
she
had
been
questioned
on
the
subject
by
tanaka
by
and
by
it
is
a
great
pity
said
cousin
sadako
that
you
have
no
baby
in
japan
if
a
wife
have
no
baby
she
is
often
divorced
but
perhaps
it
is
the
fault
of
mr
barrington
asako
had
vaguely
hoped
for
children
in
the
future
but
on
the
whole
she
was
glad
that
their
coming
had
been
delayed
there
was
so
much
to
do
and
to
see
first
of
all
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
that
her
childlessness
might
be
the
of
either
herself
or
her
husband
but
her
cousin
went
on
ruthlessly
many
men
are
like
that
because
of
their
sickness
their
wives
can
not
have
babies
asako
shivered
this
beautiful
country
of
hers
seemed
to
be
full
of
bogeys
like
a
child
dream
another
time
sadako
asked
her
with
much
diffidence
and
slanting
of
the
eyes
i
wish
to
learn
about
kissing
what
is
the
japanese
for
laughed
asako
oh
there
is
no
such
word
expostulated
sadako
shocked
at
her
cousin
levity
we
japanese
do
not
speak
of
such
things
then
japanese
people
do
kiss
oh
no
said
the
girl
not
ever
asked
asako
incredulous
only
when
they
are
quite
alone
then
when
you
see
foreign
people
kissing
in
public
you
think
it
is
very
funny
we
think
it
is
disgusting
answered
her
cousin
it
is
quite
true
foreigners
kiss
so
recklessly
they
kiss
on
meeting
they
kiss
on
parting
they
kiss
in
london
they
kiss
in
tokyo
they
kiss
indiscriminately
their
fathers
mothers
wives
mistresses
cousins
and
aunts
every
kiss
sends
a
shiver
down
the
spine
of
a
japanese
observer
of
either
sex
as
we
should
be
shocked
by
the
crude
exhibition
of
an
obscene
gesture
for
this
blossoming
of
our
buds
of
affection
suggests
to
him
with
immediate
and
detailed
clearness
that
other
embrace
of
which
in
his
mind
it
is
the
inseparable
concomitant
the
japanese
find
the
excuse
that
foreigners
know
no
better
just
as
we
excuse
the
dirty
habits
of
natives
but
they
quote
the
kiss
as
an
indisputable
proof
of
the
lowness
of
our
moral
standard
and
as
a
sign
of
the
guilt
not
of
individuals
so
much
as
of
our
whole
civilisation
foreign
people
kiss
too
much
said
cousin
sadako
it
is
a
bad
thing
if
i
had
a
husband
i
would
always
fear
he
kiss
somebody
else
that
is
why
i
am
so
happy
with
geoffrey
said
asako
i
know
he
would
never
love
any
one
but
me
it
is
not
safe
to
be
so
sure
said
her
cousin
darkly
a
woman
is
made
for
one
man
but
a
man
is
made
for
many
women
asako
arrayed
in
a
japanese
kimono
and
to
all
appearance
as
japanese
as
her
cousin
was
sitting
in
the
fujinami
she
had
not
understood
much
of
the
lesson
in
at
which
she
had
just
assisted
but
the
exceeding
propriety
and
dignity
of
the
teacher
the
daughter
of
great
people
fallen
upon
evil
days
had
impressed
her
she
longed
to
acquire
that
tranquillity
of
deportment
that
slow
graceful
poise
of
hand
and
arm
that
low
measured
speech
when
the
teacher
had
gone
she
began
to
mimic
her
gestures
with
all
the
seriousness
of
appreciative
imitation
sadako
laughed
she
supposed
that
her
cousin
was
fooling
asako
thought
that
she
was
amused
by
her
clumsiness
i
shall
never
be
able
to
do
it
she
sighed
but
of
course
you
will
i
laugh
because
you
are
so
like
kikuyé
san
kikuyé
san
was
their
teacher
if
only
i
could
practise
by
myself
said
asako
but
at
the
hotel
it
would
be
impossible
then
they
both
laughed
together
at
the
incongruity
of
rehearsing
those
dainty
rites
of
old
japan
in
the
at
the
imperial
hotel
with
geoffrey
sitting
back
in
his
and
puffing
at
his
cigar
if
only
i
had
a
little
house
like
this
said
asako
why
do
you
hire
one
suggested
her
cousin
why
not
the
idea
was
an
inspiration
so
asako
thought
and
she
broached
the
matter
to
geoffrey
that
very
evening
would
it
be
sweet
to
have
a
ducky
little
japanese
house
all
our
very
own
she
urged
oh
yes
her
husband
agreed
wearily
that
would
be
great
sport
fujinami
gentaro
was
delighted
at
the
success
of
his
diplomacy
he
saw
that
this
plan
for
a
japanese
house
meant
a
further
separation
of
husband
and
wife
a
further
step
towards
recovery
of
his
errant
child
for
he
was
beginning
to
regard
asako
with
parental
sentiment
and
to
pity
her
condition
as
the
wife
of
this
coarse
stranger
miss
sadako
was
under
no
such
altruistic
delusions
she
envied
her
cousin
she
envied
her
money
her
freedom
and
her
frank
happiness
she
had
often
pondered
about
the
ways
of
japanese
husbands
and
wives
and
the
more
she
thought
over
the
subject
the
more
she
envied
asako
her
happy
married
life
she
envied
her
with
a
woman
envy
which
seeks
to
hurt
and
spoil
she
was
smarting
from
her
own
disappointment
and
by
making
her
cousin
suffer
she
thought
that
she
could
assuage
her
own
grief
besides
the
intrigue
in
itself
interested
her
and
provided
employment
for
her
idolent
existence
and
her
restless
mind
of
affection
for
asako
she
had
none
at
all
but
then
she
had
no
affection
for
anybody
she
was
typical
of
a
modern
japanese
womanhood
which
is
the
result
of
long
repression
loveless
marriages
and
sudden
intellectual
licence
asako
thought
her
charming
because
she
had
not
yet
learned
to
discern
she
confided
to
her
all
her
ideas
about
the
new
house
and
together
the
two
girls
explored
tokyo
in
the
which
ito
provided
for
them
inspecting
properties
asako
had
already
decided
that
her
home
was
to
be
on
the
bank
of
the
river
where
she
could
see
the
boats
passing
something
like
the
house
in
which
her
father
and
mother
had
lived
the
desired
abode
was
found
at
last
on
the
at
mukojima
just
on
the
fringe
of
the
city
where
the
are
so
bright
in
springtime
where
she
could
see
the
broad
sumida
river
washing
her
garden
steps
the
fussy
little
river
boats
puffing
by
the
portly
junks
the
crews
of
students
training
for
their
regattas
and
away
on
the
opposite
bank
the
trees
of
asakusa
the
garish
river
restaurants
so
noisy
at
nightfall
the
tall
peaceful
pagoda
the
grey
roofs
and
the
red
plinths
of
the
temple
of
the
goddess
of
mercy
just
when
the
new
home
was
ready
for
occupation
just
when
enthusiasm
was
at
its
height
and
the
purchases
of
silken
bedding
and
dainty
trays
were
almost
complete
geoffrey
suddenly
announced
his
intention
of
leaving
japan
i
ca
stick
it
any
longer
he
said
fretfully
i
do
know
coming
over
me
leave
japan
cried
his
wife
aghast
well
i
do
know
grunted
her
husband
it
no
good
stopping
here
and
going
all
to
seed
the
rainy
season
was
just
over
the
hot
season
of
steaming
rain
which
the
japanese
call
it
had
played
havoc
with
nerves
he
had
never
known
anything
so
unpleasant
as
this
damp
relaxing
heat
it
made
the
walls
of
the
room
sweat
it
impregnated
paper
and
it
rotted
leather
and
spread
mould
on
boots
and
clothes
it
made
matches
unstrikeable
it
drenched
bed
with
perspiration
and
drove
away
sleep
it
sent
him
out
on
long
midnight
walks
through
the
silent
city
in
an
atmosphere
as
stifling
as
that
of
a
it
beat
down
upon
tokyo
its
fetid
exhalations
the
smell
of
cooking
of
sewage
and
of
humanity
and
the
queer
sickly
scent
of
a
powerful
evergreen
tree
aflower
throughout
the
city
which
resembled
the
reek
of
that
nagasaki
brothel
and
recalled
the
dancing
of
the
it
bred
swarms
of
bloodthirsty
mosquitoes
from
every
drop
of
stagnant
water
they
found
their
way
through
the
musty
which
separated
his
bed
from
asako
they
eluded
his
blow
in
the
evening
light
and
he
could
only
wreak
his
vengeance
in
the
morning
when
they
were
heavy
with
his
gore
the
colour
faded
from
the
englishman
cheeks
his
appetite
failed
he
was
becoming
what
he
had
never
been
before
cross
and
irritable
reggie
forsyth
wrote
to
him
from
chuzenji
yaé
is
here
and
we
go
in
for
yachting
in
a
kind
of
winged
punt
called
a
for
five
pounds
you
can
become
a
i
fancy
myself
as
a
skipper
and
i
have
already
won
two
races
but
more
often
we
escape
from
the
burble
of
the
diplomats
and
take
our
sandwiches
and
or
is
the
plural
to
the
untenanted
shores
of
the
lake
and
picnic
then
if
the
wind
does
not
fall
we
are
lucky
but
if
it
does
i
have
to
row
home
yaé
laughs
at
my
oarsmanship
and
says
that
if
you
were
here
you
would
do
it
so
much
better
you
are
a
dangerous
rival
but
for
this
once
i
challenge
you
i
have
a
spare
pen
in
my
there
is
just
room
for
you
and
barrington
you
must
be
quite
melted
by
now
but
asako
did
not
want
to
go
to
chuzenji
all
her
thoughts
were
centred
on
the
little
house
by
the
river
geoffrey
darling
she
said
stroking
his
hair
with
her
tiny
waxen
fingers
it
is
the
hot
weather
which
is
making
you
feel
cross
why
do
you
go
up
to
the
mountains
for
a
week
or
so
and
stop
with
reggie
will
you
come
asked
her
husband
brightening
i
ca
very
well
you
see
they
are
just
laying
down
the
and
when
that
is
done
the
house
will
be
ready
besides
i
feel
so
well
here
i
like
the
heat
but
i
never
been
away
without
you
objected
geoffrey
i
think
it
would
be
beastly
this
side
of
the
question
had
not
struck
asako
she
was
so
taken
up
with
her
project
now
however
she
felt
a
momentary
thrill
of
relief
she
would
be
able
to
give
all
her
time
to
her
beloved
japanese
home
geoffrey
was
a
darling
but
he
was
so
uninterested
in
everything
it
will
only
be
for
a
few
days
she
said
you
want
the
change
and
when
you
come
back
it
will
be
like
being
married
again

among

no
michi
ya
nokiba
ni
kudaru
no
dusk
it
seems
has
come
to
the
track
that
is
near
my
hut
the
voices
of
the
mountainmen
going
down
to
the
shed
geoffrey
left
early
one
morning
in
a
very
doubtful
frame
of
mind
after
having
charged
tanaka
to
take
the
greatest
care
of
his
lady
and
to
do
exactly
what
she
told
him
it
was
not
until
up
the
steep
climb
between
nikko
and
chuzenji
that
his
lungs
suddenly
seemed
to
break
through
a
thick
film
and
he
breathed
fresh
air
again
then
he
was
glad
that
he
had
come
he
was
afoot
a
coolie
strode
on
before
him
with
his
strapped
on
his
back
they
had
started
in
pouring
rain
a
long
tramp
through
narrow
gorges
geoffrey
could
feel
the
mountains
around
him
but
their
forms
were
wrapped
in
cloud
now
the
mist
was
lifting
and
although
in
places
it
still
clung
to
the
branches
like
wisps
of
the
precipitous
slopes
became
visible
and
overhead
peeping
through
the
clouds
at
impossible
elevations
pieces
of
the
mountain
seemed
to
be
falling
from
the
grey
sky
everything
was
bathed
in
rain
the
sandstone
cliffs
gleamed
like
marble
the
luxuriant
foliage
like
polished
leather
the
torrent
foamed
over
its
wilderness
of
grey
boulders
with
a
splendid
rush
of
liberty
country
people
passed
by
dressed
in
straw
overcoats
which
looked
like
or
with
thin
capes
of
oiled
paper
saffron
or
the
kimono
shirts
were
girt
up
like
fishers
both
men
and
women
showing
gnarled
and
muscular
limbs
the
complexions
of
these
mountain
folk
were
red
like
fruit
the
mongolian
yellow
was
hardly
visible
some
were
leading
long
files
of
horses
with
bells
to
their
bridles
and
high
like
cradles
painted
red
rough
girls
rode
astride
in
tight
blue
it
was
with
a
start
that
geoffrey
recognised
their
sex
and
he
wondered
vaguely
whether
men
could
fall
in
love
with
them
and
fondle
them
they
were
on
their
way
to
fetch
provision
for
the
lake
settlements
or
for
remote
way
beyond
the
mountains
the
air
was
full
of
the
clamour
of
the
torrent
the
heavy
splashing
of
raindrops
delayed
among
the
leaves
and
the
distant
thunder
of
waterfalls
what
a
relief
to
breath
again
and
what
a
pleasure
to
escape
from
the
tortuous
streets
and
the
toy
houses
from
the
twisted
prettiness
of
the
tokyo
gardens
and
the
tiresome
delicacy
of
the
mosaic
into
a
wild
and
rugged
nature
a
land
of
forests
and
mountains
reminiscent
of
switzerland
and
scotland
where
the
occasional
croak
of
a
pheasant
fell
like
music
upon
geoffrey
ear
the
two
hours
climb
ended
abruptly
in
a
level
sandy
road
running
among
birch
trees
at
a
wayside
a
man
was
sitting
on
a
low
table
he
wore
white
trousers
a
coat
of
cornflower
shade
and
a
panama
hat
all
very
spick
and
span
it
was
reggie
forsyth
hello
he
cried
my
dear
old
geoffrey
i
awfully
glad
come
but
you
ought
to
have
brought
harrington
too
you
seem
quite
incomplete
without
her
yes
it
a
peculiar
sensation
and
i
do
like
it
but
the
heat
you
know
at
tokyo
it
made
me
feel
rotten
i
simply
had
to
come
away
and
asako
is
so
busy
now
with
her
new
cousins
and
her
japanese
house
and
all
the
rest
of
it
for
the
first
time
reggie
thought
that
he
detected
a
tone
in
his
friend
voice
which
he
had
been
expecting
to
hear
sooner
or
later
a
kind
of
flagging
tone
he
found
the
word
afterwards
in
working
out
a
musical
sketch
called
geoffrey
looked
white
and
tired
he
thought
it
was
indeed
high
time
that
he
came
up
to
the
mountains
they
were
approaching
the
lake
which
already
showed
through
the
a
path
led
away
to
the
left
across
a
rustic
bridge
that
the
way
to
the
hotel
yaé
is
there
farther
along
are
the
russian
french
and
british
embassies
that
about
half
an
hour
from
here
reggie
little
villa
stood
at
a
few
minutes
distance
in
the
opposite
direction
past
two
high
japanese
hotels
which
looked
like
skeleton
houses
with
the
walls
taken
out
of
them
past
sheds
where
furs
were
on
sale
and
picture
and
dry
biscuits
the
garden
of
the
villa
jutted
out
over
the
lake
on
an
embankment
of
stones
the
house
was
discreetly
hidden
by
a
high
hedge
of
evergreens
william
tell
chapel
explained
reggie
a
week
in
lovely
lucerne
it
was
a
japanese
house
another
skeleton
from
the
wicket
gate
geoffrey
could
see
its
simple
scheme
open
to
the
four
winds
its
scanty
furniture
unblushingly
displayed
downstairs
a
table
a
sofa
some
bamboo
chairs
and
a
piano
upstairs
two
beds
two
washstands
and
the
rest
the
garden
consisted
of
two
strips
of
wiry
grass
on
each
side
of
the
house
and
a
flight
of
steps
ran
down
to
the
water
edge
where
a
small
was
moored
the
landscape
of
high
wooded
hills
was
fading
into
evening
across
the
leaden
ripples
of
the
lake
what
do
you
think
of
our
highland
home
asked
reggie
there
was
not
a
sign
of
life
over
the
heavy
waters
not
a
boat
not
a
bird
not
an
island
even
not
much
doing
commented
geoffrey
but
the
air
good
not
quite
like
a
lake
it
is
his
host
reflected
that
was
true
a
lake
had
always
appealed
to
geoffrey
both
to
his
sense
of
natural
beauty
and
to
his
instinct
for
sport
there
is
a
soothing
influence
in
the
imprisoned
waters
the
romance
of
the
sea
without
its
restlessness
and
fury
the
freshness
of
untrodden
islands
the
possibilities
of
a
world
beneath
the
waters
of
venetas
the
adventure
of
entrusting
oneself
and
one
fortunes
to
a
few
planks
of
wood
are
delights
which
the
knows
well
he
knows
too
the
delicious
sense
of
detachment
from
the
shore
the
shore
of
ordinary
affairs
and
monotonous
people
and
the
charm
of
unfamiliar
lights
and
colours
and
reflections
even
on
the
serpentine
he
can
find
this
glamour
when
the
birds
are
flocking
to
roost
in
the
trees
of
peter
pan
island
but
on
this
lake
of
chuzenji
there
was
a
sullen
brooding
an
absence
of
life
a
suggestion
of
tragedy
it
is
a
lake
explained
reggie
it
the
crater
of
an
old
volcano
which
has
filled
up
with
water
it
is
one
of
the
pockmarks
healed
over
and
forgotten
but
there
is
something
lunar
about
it
still
some
memory
of
burned
out
passions
something
creepy
in
spite
of
the
beauty
of
the
place
it
is
too
dark
this
evening
to
see
how
beautiful
it
is
in
places
the
lake
is
unfathomably
deep
and
people
have
fallen
into
the
water
and
have
never
been
seen
again
the
waters
were
almost
blue
now
a
deep
dull
greyish
blue
suddenly
away
to
the
left
lines
of
silver
streaked
the
surface
and
with
a
clapping
and
dripping
commotion
a
flight
of
white
geese
rose
they
had
been
dozing
under
the
bank
and
some
one
had
disturbed
them
a
pale
figure
like
a
little
flame
was
dimly
discernible
it
yaé
cried
reggie
and
he
made
a
noise
which
was
supposed
to
be
a
the
white
figure
waved
an
answer
reggie
picked
up
a
megaphone
which
seemed
to
be
kept
there
for
the
purpose
good
night
he
shouted
same
time
the
figure
waved
again
and
disappeared
next
morning
geoffrey
was
awakened
by
the
boom
of
a
temple
bell
he
stepped
out
on
to
his
balcony
and
saw
the
lake
and
the
hills
around
clear
and
bright
under
the
yellow
sunshine
he
drank
in
the
cool
breath
of
the
dew
for
the
first
time
after
many
limp
and
damp
awakenings
he
felt
the
thrill
of
the
wings
of
the
morning
he
thanked
god
he
had
come
if
only
asako
were
here
he
thought
perhaps
she
was
right
in
getting
a
japanese
home
just
for
the
two
of
them
they
would
be
happier
there
than
jostled
by
the
promiscuity
of
hotels
at
breakfast
reggie
had
found
a
note
from
the
ambassador
oh
damn
he
cried
i
must
go
over
and
beat
a
typewriter
for
two
or
three
hours
i
must
therefore
break
my
tryst
but
i
expect
you
to
replace
me
like
the
immortal
cyrano
who
should
be
the
ideal
of
all
soldiers
will
you
take
yaé
for
an
hour
or
two
sail
she
likes
you
very
much
and
if
i
drown
your
fiancée
i
do
know
anything
about
sailing
i
show
you
it
very
easy
besides
yaé
really
knows
more
about
it
than
i
do
so
geoffrey
after
a
short
lesson
in
steering
tacking
and
the
manipulation
of
the
centreboard
piloted
his
host
safely
over
to
british
bay
the
exclusive
precinct
of
the
temporary
embassy
on
the
opposite
shore
of
the
lake
he
then
made
his
way
round
french
cape
past
russia
cove
to
the
wooden
of
the
lakeside
hotel
there
he
found
yaé
sitting
on
a
bench
and
throwing
pebbles
at
the
geese
she
wore
the
blue
and
white
cotton
kimono
which
is
the
summer
dress
of
japanese
women
it
is
a
cheap
garment
but
most
effective
so
clean
and
cool
in
the
hot
weather
silk
kimonos
soon
become
but
this
cotton
dress
always
seems
to
be
fresh
from
the
laundry
a
rope
of
imitation
pearls
was
entwined
in
her
dark
hair
and
her
broad
sash
of
deep
blue
was
secured
in
front
with
an
old
chinese
ornament
of
jade
oh
big
captain
she
cried
i
am
so
glad
it
is
you
i
heard
you
were
coming
she
stepped
into
the
boat
and
took
over
the
tiller
and
the
command
geoffrey
explained
his
friend
absence
the
bad
boy
she
said
he
wants
to
get
away
from
me
in
order
to
think
about
a
lot
of
music
but
i
do
care
under
a
steady
wind
they
sheered
through
the
water
on
the
right
hand
was
chuzenji
village
a
swiss
effect
of
brown
chalets
dwarfed
to
utter
insignificance
by
the
huge
wooded
mountain
dome
of
nantai
san
which
rose
behind
it
on
the
left
the
forest
was
supreme
already
except
where
in
small
clearings
five
or
six
houses
tenanted
by
foreign
diplomats
stood
out
above
the
lake
a
little
farther
on
a
buddhist
temple
slumbered
above
a
flight
of
broad
stone
steps
the
sacred
buildings
were
freshly
lacquered
and
red
as
a
new
toy
in
front
on
the
slope
of
golden
sand
its
base
bathed
by
the
tiny
waves
stood
the
the
wooden
archway
which
is
japan
universal
religious
symbol
its
message
is
that
of
the
wicket
gate
in
the
progress
wherever
it
is
to
be
seen
and
it
is
to
be
seen
everywhere
it
stands
for
the
entering
in
of
the
way
whether
that
way
be
the
way
of
the
gods
or
the
way
of
the
buddhas
or
the
way
of
the
warriors
there
was
plenty
of
breeze
the
boat
shot
down
the
length
of
the
lake
at
a
delicious
speed
the
two
voyagers
reached
at
last
a
little
harbour
sh
the
beach
of
the
lilies
a
muddy
shore
with
slimy
rocks
a
few
brown
cottages
and
a
let
go
and
see
the
waterfall
suggested
yaé
it
only
a
few
minutes
they
walked
together
up
a
steep
winding
lane
the
fresh
air
and
the
birch
trees
the
sight
of
real
alderney
cows
grazing
on
patches
of
real
grass
the
distant
rumble
of
the
cataract
brought
back
to
geoffrey
a
feeling
of
strength
and
to
which
he
had
for
weeks
been
a
stranger
if
only
the
real
asako
had
been
with
him
instead
of
this
enigmatic
and
disquieting
image
of
her
the
japanese
who
have
an
innate
love
for
natural
beauty
never
fail
to
mark
an
exceptional
view
with
a
little
bench
or
shelter
for
travelers
whence
they
can
obtain
the
best
perspective
if
frequent
the
spot
in
any
number
there
will
be
an
old
dame
with
her
picture
and
her
ebisu
beer
her
champagne
cider
her
round
and
salted
biscuits
and
her
tale
of
the
local
legend
she
pipes
come
come
please
rest
a
little
but
the
cascade
above
sh
is
only
one
among
the
thousand
lesser
waterfalls
of
this
mountain
country
it
is
honoured
merely
by
an
unsteady
bench
under
a
broken
roof
and
by
a
rope
knotted
round
the
trunk
of
a
tall
tree
in
to
indicate
that
the
locality
is
an
abode
of
spirits
and
to
warn
against
inconsiderately
offending
the
undine
geoffrey
and
yaé
were
balancing
themselves
on
the
bench
gazing
at
the
race
of
foam
and
at
the
burnished
bracken
the
englishman
was
clearing
his
mind
for
action
miss
smith
he
began
at
last
do
you
think
you
will
be
happy
with
reggie
he
says
so
big
captain
answered
the
little
her
mouth
queerly
twisted
because
if
you
are
not
happy
reggie
wo
be
happy
and
if
you
are
neither
of
you
happy
you
will
be
sorry
that
you
but
we
are
not
married
yet
said
the
girl
we
are
only
engaged
but
you
will
be
married
sometime
i
suppose
this
year
next
year
sometime
never
laughed
yaé
it
is
nice
to
be
engaged
and
it
is
such
a
protection
when
i
am
not
engaged
all
the
old
cats
lady
cynthia
and
the
rest
say
that
i
flirt
now
when
i
am
engaged
my
fiancé
is
here
to
shield
me
then
they
dare
not
say
things
or
it
comes
round
to
him
and
he
is
angry
so
i
can
do
anything
i
like
when
i
am
engaged
this
was
a
new
morality
for
geoffrey
it
knocked
the
text
from
under
the
sermon
which
he
had
been
preparing
she
was
as
preposterous
as
reggie
but
she
was
not
like
him
conscious
of
her
preposterousness
then
when
you
are
married
will
you
flirt
asked
her
companion
i
think
so
said
yaé
gravely
besides
reggie
only
wants
me
to
dress
me
up
and
write
music
about
me
if
i
am
always
the
same
like
an
english
doll
wife
he
wo
get
many
tunes
to
play
reggie
is
like
a
girl
reggie
is
too
good
for
you
said
the
englishman
roughly
i
do
think
so
said
yaé
i
do
want
reggie
but
reggie
wants
me
what
do
you
want
then
i
want
a
great
big
man
with
arms
and
legs
like
a
wrestler
a
man
who
hunts
lions
he
will
pick
me
up
like
you
did
at
kamakura
big
captain
and
throw
me
in
the
air
and
catch
me
again
and
i
will
take
him
away
from
the
woman
he
loves
so
that
he
will
hate
me
and
beat
me
for
it
and
when
he
sees
on
my
back
the
marks
of
the
whip
and
the
blood
he
will
love
me
again
so
strongly
that
he
will
become
weak
and
silly
like
a
baby
then
i
will
look
after
him
and
nurse
him
and
we
will
drink
wine
together
and
we
will
go
for
long
rides
together
on
horseback
in
the
moonlight
galloping
along
the
sands
by
the
edge
of
the
sea
geoffrey
was
gazing
at
her
with
alarm
was
she
going
mad
the
girl
jumped
up
and
laid
her
little
hands
on
his
shoulder
there
big
captain
she
cried
do
be
frightened
that
is
only
one
of
reggie
piano
tunes
i
never
heard
tunes
like
his
before
he
plays
them
and
then
explains
to
me
what
each
note
means
and
then
he
plays
the
tune
again
and
i
can
see
the
whole
story
that
is
why
i
love
him
sometimes
then
you
love
him
geoffrey
was
clutching
pathetically
for
anything
which
he
could
understand
or
appeal
to
in
this
elusive
person
i
love
him
said
yaé
pirouetting
on
her
white
toes
near
the
edge
of
the
chasm
and
i
love
you
and
i
love
any
man
who
is
worth
loving
they
returned
to
the
lake
in
silence
geoffrey
sermon
was
abortive
this
girl
was
altogether
outside
the
circle
of
his
code
of
good
form
he
might
as
well
preach
vegetarianism
to
a
leopard
yet
she
fascinated
him
as
she
fascinated
all
men
who
were
not
as
dry
as
aubrey
laking
she
was
so
pretty
so
frail
and
so
fearless
life
had
not
given
her
a
fair
chance
and
she
appealed
to
the
chivalrous
instinct
in
men
as
well
as
to
their
less
creditable
passions
she
was
such
a
butterfly
creature
and
the
flaring
lamps
of
life
had
such
a
fatal
attraction
for
her
the
wind
was
blowing
straight
against
the
harbour
the
bay
of
sh
was
shallow
water
try
as
he
might
geoffrey
could
not
manoeuvre
the
little
yacht
into
the
open
waters
of
the
lake
we
are
on
a
said
geoffrey
at
the
end
he
had
to
get
down
and
wade
towing
the
boat
after
him
until
at
last
yaé
announced
that
the
centreboard
had
been
lowered
and
that
the
boat
was
answering
to
the
helm
geoffrey
clambered
in
dripping
he
shook
himself
like
a
big
dog
after
a
swim
reggie
could
never
have
done
that
said
yaé
with
fervent
admiration
he
would
be
afraid
of
catching
cold
at
last
they
reached
the
steps
of
the
villa
they
were
both
hungry
i
am
going
to
stop
to
lunch
big
captain
said
yaé
reggie
wo
be
back
how
do
you
know
because
i
saw
gwendolen
cairns
listening
last
evening
when
he
spoke
to
me
through
the
big
trumpet
she
tells
lady
cynthia
and
that
means
a
lot
of
work
next
day
for
poor
reggie
so
that
he
ca
spend
his
time
with
me
you
see
oh
how
i
hate
women
after
lunch
at
chuzenji
all
the
world
goes
to
sleep
it
awakes
at
about
four
when
the
white
sails
come
gliding
out
of
the
green
bays
like
swans
they
greet
or
avoid
they
run
side
by
side
for
the
length
of
a
puff
of
breeze
they
coquet
with
one
another
like
butterflies
or
they
head
for
one
of
those
hidden
beaches
which
are
the
principal
charm
of
the
lake
where
baskets
are
unpacked
and
cakes
and
sandwiches
appear
where
dry
sticks
are
gathered
for
a
rustic
fire
and
after
an
hour
or
more
of
anxious
stoking
the
kettle
boils
of
all
the
japanese
holiday
places
chuzenji
is
the
most
select
and
the
most
agreeable
reggie
forsyth
explained
it
is
the
only
place
in
all
japan
where
the
foreigner
is
genuinely
popular
and
respected
he
spends
his
money
freely
he
does
not
swear
or
scold
the
type
who
has
disgraced
us
in
the
open
ports
is
unknown
here
these
native
mountaineers
are
rough
and
uneducated
savages
but
they
are
honest
and
healthy
we
feel
on
easy
terms
with
them
as
we
do
with
our
own
peasantry
in
the
village
street
of
chuzenji
i
have
seen
a
young
english
officer
instructing
the
sons
of
boatmen
and
woodcutters
in
the
mysteries
of
cricket
in
chuzenji
there
are
no
japanese
visitors
except
the
pilgrims
who
throng
to
the
lake
during
the
season
for
climbing
the
holy
mountain
of
nantai
these
are
country
people
all
of
them
from
villages
all
over
japan
who
have
drawn
lucky
lots
in
the
local
pilgrimage
club
one
can
recognize
them
at
once
by
their
dingy
white
clothes
like
men
and
women
are
garbed
alike
by
their
straw
mushroom
hats
by
the
strip
of
straw
matting
strapped
across
their
shoulders
and
by
the
long
wooden
staves
which
they
carry
and
which
will
be
stamped
with
the
seal
of
the
when
they
have
reached
the
summit
these
pilgrims
are
lodged
free
by
the
temple
on
the
in
long
sheds
like
the
endless
files
of
lean
laden
with
bags
of
rice
and
other
provisions
the
ruddy
sexless
girls
who
lead
them
and
the
women
who
have
been
foraging
for
wood
and
come
down
from
the
mountain
with
enormous
faggots
on
their
bent
shoulders
provide
a
foreground
for
the
chuzenji
landscape
geoffrey
was
sleeping
upstairs
in
his
bedroom
yaé
was
sleeping
downstairs
on
the
sofa
he
had
expected
her
to
return
to
the
hotel
after
lunch
but
her
attitude
was
that
of
suis
he
awoke
with
a
start
to
find
the
girl
standing
beside
his
bed
afterwards
he
became
sure
that
he
had
been
awakened
by
the
touch
of
soft
fingers
on
his
face
wake
up
big
captain
she
was
saying
it
is
four
and
the
ark
coming
what
ark
he
yawned
why
the
embassy
boat
out
of
sheer
devilry
miss
smith
waited
for
the
arrival
of
lady
cynthia
the
great
lady
paid
no
more
attention
to
her
existence
than
if
she
had
been
a
piece
of
the
house
but
she
greeted
geoffrey
most
cordially
come
for
a
walk
she
said
in
her
abrupt
way
as
they
turned
down
the
village
street
she
announced
the
worst
has
happened
i
suppose
you
know
about
reggie
yes
he
actually
engaged
to
be
married
to
the
creature
has
he
told
you
in
the
greatest
confidence
well
he
forgot
to
bind
his
young
lady
to
secrecy
she
has
told
everybody
ca
he
be
recalled
to
london
the
old
man
says
that
would
just
push
him
over
the
edge
he
has
talked
of
resigning
from
the
service
is
there
anything
to
be
done
nothing
let
him
marry
her
it
will
spoil
his
career
in
diplomacy
of
course
but
he
will
soon
get
tired
of
her
fooling
him
he
will
divorce
her
and
will
give
up
his
life
to
music
to
which
of
course
he
belongs
people
like
reggie
forsyth
have
no
right
to
marry
at
all
but
are
you
sure
that
she
wants
to
marry
him
said
his
friend
and
he
related
his
conversation
with
yaé
that
morning
that
very
interesting
and
encouraging
said
her
excellency
so
she
has
been
trying
her
hand
on
you
already
i
never
thought
of
that
exclaimed
geoffrey
why
she
knows
that
reggie
is
my
best
friend
and
that
i
am
married
the
judicial
features
of
lady
cynthia
lightened
with
a
judicial
smile
you
have
been
through
so
many
london
seasons
captain
barrington
and
there
is
still
no
guile
in
you
they
walked
on
in
silence
past
the
temple
terraces
down
a
winding
country
lane
captain
barrington
would
you
care
to
play
the
part
of
a
real
hero
a
real
theatre
hero
playing
to
the
gallery
geoffrey
was
baffled
had
the
talk
suddenly
swung
over
to
amateur
theatricals
lady
cynthia
was
a
terrible
puller
of
legs
did
you
ever
hear
of
madge
carlyle
she
asked
or
was
she
before
your
time
i
have
heard
of
her
she
was
a
famous
london
in
the
days
when
mashers
wore
whiskers
and
champagne
charlie
was
sung
at
the
age
of
said
lady
cynthia
madge
decided
to
marry
for
the
third
or
fourth
time
she
had
found
a
charming
young
man
with
plenty
of
money
and
a
noble
heart
who
believed
that
madge
was
a
much
slandered
woman
his
friends
were
sorry
for
the
young
man
and
one
of
them
decided
to
give
a
dinner
to
celebrate
the
betrothal
in
the
middle
of
the
feast
an
urgent
message
arrived
for
the
enamoured
one
summoning
him
to
his
home
when
he
had
gone
the
others
started
plying
poor
madge
with
drinks
she
was
very
fond
of
drinks
they
had
splendid
fun
then
one
of
the
guests
he
was
an
old
lover
of
madge
suggested
to
the
old
days
and
the
rest
of
it
but
what
did
he
think
of
his
friends
asked
geoffrey
it
seems
a
sort
of
trick
he
was
very
sore
about
it
at
the
time
said
lady
cynthia
but
afterwards
he
understood
that
they
were
heroes
real
theatre
heroes
it
looks
like
rain
said
geoffrey
uneasily
so
they
turned
back
talking
about
london
people
the
first
drops
fell
as
they
were
passing
through
the
wicket
gate
and
they
entered
the
house
during
a
roar
of
thunder
reggie
was
alone
i
see
that
my
fate
is
sealed
he
said
as
he
rose
to
meet
them
heavens
themselves
blaze
forth
the
death
of
princes
chapter
xix
yaé
smith
wo
toraete
mireba
waga
ko
the
thief
when
i
caught
him
and
looked
at
him
lo
my
own
child
a
week
of
very
hard
work
began
for
reggie
the
ambassador
was
reporting
home
on
every
imaginable
subject
from
political
assassination
to
the
manufacture
of
celluloid
this
was
part
of
lady
cynthia
scheme
she
was
determined
to
throw
yaé
smith
and
geoffrey
barrington
together
all
the
time
and
to
risk
the
consequences
so
yaé
though
she
had
her
room
at
the
hotel
became
an
inmate
of
reggie
villa
she
took
all
her
meals
there
and
her
siesta
during
most
of
the
afternoons
she
even
passed
whole
nights
with
reggie
and
their
relations
could
no
longer
be
a
secret
even
to
laborious
discretion
this
knowledge
troubled
him
for
the
presence
of
lovers
and
the
shadows
cast
by
their
intimacies
are
always
disquieting
even
to
the
purest
minds
but
geoffrey
felt
that
it
was
no
business
of
his
and
that
reggie
and
yaé
being
what
they
were
it
would
be
useless
hypocrisy
for
him
to
censure
their
pleasures
meanwhile
asako
was
writing
to
him
bewailing
her
loneliness
so
one
morning
at
breakfast
he
announced
that
he
must
be
getting
back
to
tokyo
a
cloud
passed
over
yaé
face
not
yet
big
captain
she
expostulated
i
want
to
take
you
right
to
the
far
end
of
the
lake
where
the
bears
live
very
well
agreed
geoffrey
morning
early
then
for
the
next
day
i
really
must
go
he
wrote
to
asako
a
long
letter
with
much
about
the
lake
and
yaé
smith
promising
to
return
within
hours
at
daybreak
next
morning
yaé
was
hammering
at
geoffrey
door
wake
up
old
sleepy
captain
she
cried
geoffrey
got
the
boat
ready
and
yaé
prepared
a
picnic
breakfast
to
be
eaten
on
the
way
poor
reggie
of
course
had
work
at
the
embassy
he
could
not
come
it
was
an
ideal
excursion
they
reached
senju
the
village
at
the
end
of
the
lake
they
ascended
the
forest
path
as
far
as
the
upper
lake
a
mere
pond
of
reeds
and
sedges
which
the
bears
are
supposed
to
haunt
geoffrey
and
yaé
however
saw
nothing
more
alarming
than
the
village
curs
returned
in
safety
from
the
land
of
danger
cried
the
girl
as
she
sprang
ashore
at
the
steps
of
the
villa
the
air
and
exercise
had
wearied
geoffrey
after
lunch
he
changed
into
a
kimono
of
reggie
then
he
lay
down
on
his
bed
and
was
soon
fast
asleep
how
long
he
slept
he
could
not
say
but
he
awoke
slowly
out
of
confusing
dreams
somebody
was
in
his
room
somebody
was
near
his
bed
was
it
asako
was
it
a
dream
no
it
was
his
comrade
of
the
morning
voyage
it
was
yaé
smith
she
was
sitting
on
the
bed
beside
him
she
was
gazing
into
his
face
with
her
soft
still
eyes
what
was
she
doing
that
for
she
was
stroking
his
arm
her
touch
was
soft
he
did
not
stop
her
her
hair
was
let
down
to
below
her
waist
long
black
hair
more
silky
in
texture
and
more
wavy
than
that
of
a
pure
japanese
woman
her
kimono
was
wide
open
at
the
throat
a
sweet
fragrance
exhaled
from
her
body
big
captain
may
i
she
pleaded
what
said
geoffrey
still
half
asleep
just
lie
by
your
side
just
once
just
for
the
last
time
she
cooed
geoffrey
was
for
going
to
sleep
again
well
pleased
with
his
dream
but
yaé
slipped
an
arm
across
his
chest
and
caught
his
shoulder
in
her
hand
she
nestled
closer
to
him
geoffrey
she
murmured
i
love
you
so
much
you
are
so
strong
and
so
big
geoffrey
i
want
to
stay
like
this
always
always
holding
on
to
you
till
i
make
you
love
me
love
me
just
a
little
geoffrey
nobody
will
ever
know
geoffrey
it
must
be
nice
to
have
me
near
you
geoffrey
you
must
you
must
want
to
love
me
she
was
hugging
his
body
now
in
an
embrace
astonishingly
powerful
for
so
small
a
creature
it
was
this
pressure
which
finally
awoke
geoffrey
gently
he
disengaged
her
arms
and
sat
up
in
the
bed
she
was
clinging
to
his
neck
now
like
a
maenad
he
felt
pitifully
ridiculous
the
rôle
of
joseph
is
so
thankless
and
humiliating
a
month
ago
he
would
have
ordered
her
sternly
to
get
out
of
the
room
and
behave
herself
but
the
hot
month
in
tokyo
had
relaxed
his
firmness
of
mind
and
familiarity
with
reggie
bohemian
morality
has
sapped
his
fortress
of
good
form
do
be
so
naughty
yaé
he
said
feebly
reggie
may
be
coming
for
god
sake
control
yourself
her
voice
was
terrible
now
geoffrey
had
lost
the
first
moment
when
he
might
have
been
stern
with
her
clumsily
he
tried
to
loosen
her
embrace
but
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
in
the
grip
of
an
elemental
natural
force
a
thing
foreign
to
his
experience
of
women
in
marriage
or
out
of
it
yaé
do
he
gasped
pushing
the
girl
away
i
ca
married
married
she
screamed
does
marriage
hurt
like
this
love
me
love
me
geoffrey
you
must
love
me
you
will
the
rhapsody
is
ended
a
voice
which
nobody
would
have
recognized
as
reggie
put
a
sudden
end
to
this
frantic
assault
he
was
standing
in
the
doorway
smiling
queerly
he
had
watched
the
two
from
the
garden
whence
indeed
all
chuzenji
could
have
seen
them
in
the
open
bedroom
he
had
slipped
off
his
shoes
and
had
stolen
up
quietly
in
order
to
listen
to
them
now
he
judged
it
time
to
intervene
yaé
started
up
from
the
bed
for
a
moment
she
hovered
on
the
edge
uncertain
of
her
tactics
geoffrey
stared
one
hand
to
his
forehead
then
the
girl
darted
across
the
room
fell
at
reggie
feet
clasped
his
knees
and
sobbed
convulsively
reggie
reggie
forgive
me
she
cried
it
not
my
fault
he
been
asking
me
and
asking
me
to
do
this
ever
since
kamakura
and
all
the
time
here
this
is
what
he
came
to
stay
here
for
reggie
forgive
me
i
will
never
be
naughty
again
reggie
looked
across
at
his
friend
for
confirmation
or
denial
the
queer
smile
had
vanished
good
form
decreed
that
the
man
must
lie
for
the
woman
sake
if
necessary
till
his
soul
were
damned
but
with
geoffrey
good
form
had
long
since
been
thrown
to
the
winds
like
international
law
in
war
time
besides
the
woman
was
no
better
than
a
and
reggie
friendship
was
at
stake
no
he
said
huskily
that
is
not
true
i
was
quietly
sleeping
here
and
she
came
up
to
me
she
is
the
tangled
heap
at
reggie
feet
leaped
up
her
green
eyes
blazing
liar
she
cried
reggie
do
you
believe
him
the
hypocrite
the
the
white
slave
man
the
pimp
what
does
she
mean
said
geoffrey
thank
god
the
woman
was
clearly
mad
fujinami
fujinami
she
yelled
the
great
girl
king
the
yoshiwara
every
scrap
of
money
which
his
fool
wife
spends
on
sham
curios
was
made
in
the
yoshiwara
made
by
women
made
out
of
filth
made
by
prostitutes
the
last
word
brought
geoffrey
to
his
feet
in
his
real
agony
he
had
quite
forgotten
his
sham
sin
reggie
for
god
sake
tell
me
is
this
true
yes
said
reggie
quietly
it
is
quite
true
then
why
did
no
one
tell
me
husbands
said
the
young
man
and
prospective
husbands
are
always
the
last
to
learn
yaé
go
back
to
the
hotel
you
have
done
enough
harm
for
not
unless
you
forgive
me
reggie
the
girl
pleaded
i
will
never
go
unless
you
forgive
i
ca
forgive
he
said
but
i
can
probably
forget
the
wrath
of
these
two
men
fascinated
her
she
would
have
waited
if
she
could
listening
at
the
door
reggie
knew
this
if
you
do
clear
out
yaé
i
will
have
to
call
t
to
take
you
he
threatened
to
his
great
relief
she
went
quietly
reggie
returned
to
the
bare
bedroom
where
geoffrey
with
bowed
head
was
staring
at
the
floor
in
reggie
short
kimono
the
big
man
looked
decidedly
ridiculous
good
thought
reggie
thank
god
for
the
comic
spirit
it
will
be
easier
to
get
through
with
this
now
his
first
action
was
to
wash
his
hands
he
had
an
unconscious
instinct
for
symbolism
then
he
sat
down
opposite
his
friend
the
action
of
sitting
reduces
tragedy
to
comedy
at
once
this
was
one
of
napoleon
maxims
then
he
opened
his
cigarette
case
and
offered
it
to
geoffrey
this
too
was
symbolic
geoffrey
took
a
cigarette
mechanically
and
sucked
it
between
his
lips
unlighted
geoffrey
said
his
friend
very
quietly
let
us
try
to
put
these
women
and
all
their
rottenness
out
of
our
heads
we
will
try
to
talk
this
over
decently
geoffrey
was
so
stunned
by
the
shock
of
what
he
had
just
learned
that
he
had
thought
of
nothing
else
now
all
of
a
sudden
he
remembered
that
he
owed
serious
explanations
to
his
friend
reggie
he
said
dully
i
most
awfully
sorry
i
had
never
dreamed
of
this
i
was
good
pals
with
yaé
because
of
you
i
never
dreamed
of
making
love
to
her
you
know
how
i
love
my
wife
she
must
have
been
mad
to
think
of
me
like
that
besides
he
added
sheepishly
nothing
actually
happened
i
sure
i
do
care
what
actually
happened
or
did
not
happen
damn
actual
facts
they
distort
the
truth
they
are
at
the
bottom
of
every
injustice
what
actually
happened
never
matters
it
is
the
picture
which
sticks
in
one
brain
true
or
false
it
sticks
just
the
same
and
suddenly
or
slowly
it
alters
every
thing
but
i
can
wipe
up
my
own
mess
i
think
it
is
much
more
serious
with
you
than
with
me
geoffrey
she
has
bruised
my
heel
but
she
has
broken
your
head
no
do
protest
for
heaven
sake
i
am
not
interested
then
what
she
says
is
absolutely
true
said
geoffrey
lighting
his
cigarette
at
last
and
throwing
the
match
aside
as
if
it
were
hope
for
a
whole
year
i
have
been
living
on
prostitutes
earnings
i
am
no
better
than
those
awful
in
leicester
square
who
can
be
flogged
if
they
are
caught
and
serve
them
right
too
and
all
that
filthy
yoshiwara
it
belongs
to
asako
to
my
sweet
innocent
little
girl
just
as
brandan
belongs
to
my
father
and
with
all
this
filthy
money
we
have
been
buying
comforts
and
clothes
and
curios
and
rubbish
reggie
was
pouring
out
whiskies
and
sodas
two
strong
ones
geoffrey
gulped
down
his
drink
and
then
proceeded
with
his
lamentation
i
understand
it
all
now
everybody
knew
the
secrecy
and
the
mystery
even
at
my
wedding
they
were
saying
go
to
japan
do
go
they
must
have
all
known
even
then
and
then
those
damned
fujinami
so
anxious
to
be
civil
for
the
beastly
money
sake
and
yet
hiding
everything
and
lying
all
the
time
and
you
knew
and
the
ambassador
and
count
saito
and
the
servants
too
always
whispering
and
laughing
behind
our
backs
but
you
reggie
you
were
my
friend
you
ought
to
have
told
me
i
asked
sir
ralph
said
reggie
candidly
whether
you
ought
to
be
told
he
is
a
very
wise
man
he
said
he
said
would
be
cruel
and
it
would
be
useless
they
will
go
back
to
england
soon
and
then
they
will
never
know
where
ignorance
is
bliss
you
understand
it
was
unfair
groaned
geoffrey
you
were
all
deceiving
me
i
said
to
sir
ralph
that
it
seemed
to
me
unfair
and
dangerous
but
he
has
more
experience
than
i
but
what
am
i
to
do
now
said
the
big
man
helplessly
this
money
must
be
given
up
yes
and
everything
we
have
but
whom
to
not
to
those
filthy
fujinami
go
slow
advised
reggie
go
back
to
england
first
get
your
brain
clear
talk
it
over
with
your
lawyers
do
be
too
generous
magnanimity
has
spoiled
many
noble
lives
and
remember
that
your
wife
is
in
this
too
you
must
consider
her
first
she
is
very
young
and
she
knows
nothing
i
do
think
that
she
wants
to
be
poor
or
that
she
will
understand
your
motives
i
will
make
her
understand
then
said
geoffrey
do
talk
like
a
brute
you
will
have
to
be
very
patient
and
considerate
for
her
go
slow
can
i
stop
here
then
asked
barrington
plaintively
no
said
reggie
with
firmness
that
is
really
more
than
i
could
stick
i
told
you
truth
or
untruth
the
mind
keeps
on
seeing
pictures
pack
up
your
things
call
a
coolie
the
evening
walk
down
to
nikko
will
do
you
more
good
than
my
jawing
an
unreal
handshake
and
he
was
gone
then
of
a
sudden
geoffrey
realized
that
how
very
unwittingly
he
had
deeply
wronged
this
man
who
was
his
best
friend
and
upon
whom
he
was
leaning
in
his
hour
of
trial
like
job
his
adversities
were
coming
upon
him
from
this
side
and
from
that
until
he
must
curse
god
and
die
now
his
friend
had
given
him
his
dismissal
he
would
probably
never
see
reggie
forsyth
again
as
he
was
starting
on
his
long
walk
downhill
a
motor
car
passed
him
only
one
motor
car
that
season
had
climbed
the
precipitous
road
from
the
plains
it
must
be
yaé
smith
just
as
it
was
passing
the
girl
leaned
out
of
the
carriage
and
blew
a
kiss
to
geoffrey
she
was
not
alone
there
was
a
small
fat
man
in
the
car
beside
her
a
japanese
with
a
round
impertinent
face
with
a
throb
of
bitter
geoffrey
recognized
his
own
servant
tanaka
next
morning
reggie
forsyth
crossed
the
lake
as
usual
to
his
work
at
the
embassy
he
met
the
ambassadress
on
the
terrace
of
her
villa
good
morning
lady
cynthia
he
said
i
congratulate
you
on
your
masterly
diplomacy
what
do
you
mean
her
manner
nowadays
was
very
chilly
towards
her
former
favourite
in
accordance
with
your
admirable
arrangements
he
said
my
marriage
is
off
oh
reggie
her
coolness
changed
at
once
i
so
glad
he
held
up
a
warning
hand
but
you
have
broken
a
better
man
than
i
why
what
do
you
mean
geoffrey
barrington
he
has
learned
who
the
fujinami
are
and
where
his
money
comes
from
you
told
him
i
not
such
a
skunk
as
all
that
lady
cynthia
her
excellency
was
pondering
what
had
better
be
done
for
geoffrey
where
is
he
she
asked
he
stopped
the
night
at
nikko
he
is
probably
in
the
train
for
tokyo
by
now
if
she
were
a
hero
a
real
theatre
hero
as
geoffrey
had
been
apparently
she
would
go
straight
off
to
tokyo
also
and
perhaps
she
would
be
able
to
prevent
a
catastrophe
or
perhaps
she
would
not
perhaps
she
would
only
make
things
worse
on
the
whole
she
had
better
stop
in
chuzenji
and
look
after
her
own
husband
reggie
she
said
you
had
a
lucky
escape
how
did
you
know
that
i
had
any
hand
in
this
you
more
of
a
girl
than
a
man
a
rotten
marriage
would
have
broken
you
geoffrey
barrington
is
made
of
stronger
stuff
he
is
in
for
a
bad
time
but
he
will
learn
a
lot
which
you
know
already
and
he
will
survive

it

who

and

come
my
lord
do
not
dream
of
listening
to
the
of
people
after
a
ghastly
night
of
sleeplessness
at
nikko
geoffrey
barrington
reached
tokyo
in
time
for
lunch
his
thoughts
were
confused
and
discordant
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
drunk
for
a
week
he
kept
on
saying
to
himself
indeed
he
felt
a
fume
of
unreality
over
all
his
actions
one
thing
was
certain
financially
he
was
a
ruined
man
the
thousands
a
year
which
yesterday
morning
had
been
practically
his
the
ease
and
comfort
which
had
seemed
so
secure
were
lost
more
hopelessly
than
if
his
bank
had
failed
even
the
cash
in
his
pocket
he
touched
with
the
greatest
disgust
as
if
those
identical
bills
and
coins
had
been
paid
across
the
brothel
counter
as
the
price
for
a
man
dirty
pleasures
and
a
girl
shame
and
disease
he
imagined
that
the
nikko
looked
at
his
notes
suspiciously
as
though
they
were
endorsed
with
the
seal
of
the
yoshiwara
geoffrey
was
ruined
he
was
henceforth
dependent
on
what
his
brain
could
earn
and
on
what
his
father
would
allow
him
five
hundred
pounds
a
year
at
the
outside
if
he
had
been
alone
in
the
world
it
would
not
have
mattered
much
but
asako
poor
little
asako
the
innocent
cause
of
this
disaster
she
was
ruined
too
she
who
loved
her
riches
her
jewellery
her
pretty
things
she
would
have
to
sell
them
all
she
would
have
to
follow
him
into
poverty
she
who
had
no
experience
of
its
meaning
this
was
his
punishment
perhaps
for
having
steadily
pursued
the
idea
of
a
rich
marriage
but
what
had
asako
done
to
deserve
it
thank
god
his
marriage
had
at
least
not
been
a
loveless
one
geoffrey
felt
acutely
the
need
of
human
sympathy
in
his
trouble
by
sheer
bad
luck
he
had
forfeited
reggie
friendship
but
he
could
still
depend
upon
his
wife
love
so
he
ran
up
the
stairs
at
the
imperial
hotel
longing
for
welcome
though
he
dreaded
the
obligation
to
break
the
bad
news
he
threw
open
the
door
the
room
was
empty
he
looked
for
cloaks
and
hats
and
curios
for
luggage
for
any
sign
of
her
presence
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
room
was
hers
sick
with
apprehension
he
returned
to
the
corridor
there
was
a
near
at
hand
go
away
said
the
no
come
back
i
think
where
has
she
gone
asked
geoffrey
the
with
the
infuriating
japanese
grin
shook
his
head
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
he
said
very
early
plenty
people
come
tanaka
san
and
two
japanese
girls
very
plenty
talk
cry
tears
all
nice
kimono
take
away
very
quick
then
tanaka
where
is
he
go
away
with
the
boy
grinned
again
i
am
very
sorry
geoffrey
slammed
the
door
in
the
face
of
his
tormentor
he
staggered
into
a
chair
and
collapsed
staring
blankly
what
could
have
happened
slowly
his
ideas
returned
tanaka
he
had
seen
the
little
beast
in
yaé
motor
car
at
chuzenji
he
must
have
come
spying
after
his
master
as
he
had
done
fifty
times
before
he
and
that
devil
had
raced
him
back
to
tokyo
had
got
in
ahead
of
him
and
had
told
a
pack
of
lies
to
asako
she
must
have
believed
them
since
she
had
gone
away
but
where
had
she
gone
to
the
had
said
two
japanese
girls
she
must
have
gone
to
the
fujinami
house
and
to
her
horribly
unclean
cousins
he
must
find
her
at
once
he
must
open
her
eyes
to
the
truth
he
must
bring
her
back
he
must
take
her
away
from
japan
forever
harrington
was
crossing
the
hall
of
the
hotel
muttering
to
himself
seeing
nothing
hearing
nothing
when
he
felt
a

monsieur
this
country

full
of
devils
devils
and
lies
he
left
her
sobbing
in
the
hall
of
the
hotel
with
a
cluster
of
watching
her
geoffrey
took
a
taxi
to
the
fujinami
house
no
one
answered
his
ringing
but
he
thought
that
he
could
hear
voices
inside
the
building
so
he
strode
in
unannounced
and
with
his
boots
on
his
feet
an
unspeakable
offence
against
japanese
etiquette
he
found
asako
in
a
room
which
overlooked
the
garden
where
he
had
been
received
on
former
occasions
her
cousin
sadako
was
with
her
and
ito
the
lawyer
to
his
surprise
and
disgust
his
wife
was
dressed
in
the
japanese
kimono
and
which
had
once
been
so
pleasing
to
his
eyes
her
change
of
nationality
seemed
to
be
already
complete
this
was
an
asako
whom
he
had
never
known
before
her
eyes
were
ringed
with
weeping
and
her
face
was
thin
and
haggard
but
her
expression
had
a
new
look
of
resolution
she
was
no
longer
a
child
a
doll
in
the
space
of
a
few
hours
she
had
grown
to
be
a
woman
they
were
all
standing
sadako
and
the
lawyer
had
formed
up
behind
the
runaway
as
though
to
give
her
moral
support
asako
said
geoffrey
sternly
what
does
this
mean
the
presence
of
the
two
japanese
exasperated
him
his
manner
was
tactless
and
unfortunate
his
tall
stature
in
the
dainty
room
looked
coarse
and
brutal
sadako
and
ito
were
staring
at
his
offending
boots
with
an
expression
of
utter
horror
geoffrey
suddenly
remembered
that
he
ought
to
have
taken
them
off
oh
damn
he
thought
geoffrey
said
his
wife
i
ca
come
back
i
am
sorry
i
have
decided
to
stay
here
why
asked
geoffrey
brusquely
because
i
know
that
you
do
not
love
me
i
think
you
never
loved
anything
except
my
money
the
hideous
irony
of
this
statement
made
poor
geoffrey
gasp
he
gripped
the
wooden
framework
of
the
room
so
as
to
steady
himself
good
god
he
shouted
your
money
do
you
know
where
it
comes
from
asako
stared
at
him
more
and
more
bewildered
send
these
people
out
of
the
room
and
i
tell
you
said
geoffrey
i
would
rather
they
stayed
his
wife
answered
it
had
been
arranged
beforehand
that
if
geoffrey
called
asako
was
not
to
be
left
alone
with
him
she
had
been
made
to
believe
that
she
was
in
danger
of
physical
violence
she
was
terribly
frightened
very
well
geoffrey
blundered
on
every
penny
you
have
is
made
out
of
prostitution
out
of
the
sale
of
women
to
men
you
saw
the
yoshiwara
you
saw
the
poor
women
imprisoned
there
you
know
that
any
drunken
beast
can
come
and
pay
his
money
down
and
say
want
that
girl
and
she
has
to
give
herself
up
to
be
kissed
and
pulled
about
by
him
even
if
she
hates
him
and
loathes
him
well
all
this
filthy
yoshiwara
and
all
those
poor
girls
and
all
that
dirty
money
belongs
to
these
fujinami
and
to
you
that
is
why
they
are
so
rich
and
that
is
why
we
have
been
so
rich
if
we
were
in
england
we
could
be
flogged
for
this
and
imprisoned
and
serve
us
right
too
and
all
this
money
is
bad
and
if
we
keep
it
we
are
worse
than
criminals
and
neither
of
us
can
ever
be
happy
or
look
any
one
in
the
face
again
asako
was
shaking
her
head
gently
like
an
automaton
understanding
not
a
word
of
all
this
outburst
her
mind
was
on
one
thing
only
her
husband
infidelity
his
mind
was
on
one
thing
only
the
shame
of
his
wife
money
they
were
like
who
concentrate
their
attention
exclusively
on
the
cards
in
their
own
hands
oblivious
to
what
their
partners
or
opponents
may
hold
asako
remaining
silent
ito
began
to
speak
his
voice
seemed
more
squeaky
than
ever
captain
barrington
he
said
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
but
you
see
now
true
condition
of
things
you
must
remember
you
are
english
gentleman
barrington
wishes
not
to
return
to
you
she
has
been
told
that
you
make
misconduct
with
miss
smith
at
kamakura
and
again
at
chuzenji
miss
smith
herself
says
so
harrington
thinks
this
story
must
be
true
or
miss
smith
do
not
tell
so
bad
story
about
herself
we
think
she
is
quite
right
shut
up
thundered
geoffrey
this
is
a
matter
for
me
and
my
wife
alone
please
leave
us
my
wife
has
heard
one
side
of
a
story
which
is
unfair
and
untrue
she
must
hear
from
me
what
really
happened
i
think
some
other
day
it
would
be
better
cousin
sadako
intervened
you
see
barrington
can
not
speak
she
is
too
unhappy
it
was
quite
true
asako
stood
like
a
dummy
neither
seeing
nor
hearing
apparently
neither
assenting
nor
contradicting
how
powerful
is
the
influence
of
clothes
if
asako
had
been
dressed
in
her
paris
coat
and
skirt
her
husband
would
have
crossed
the
few
mats
which
separated
them
and
would
have
carried
her
off
but
in
her
kimono
did
she
wholly
belong
to
him
or
was
she
a
japanese
again
a
fujinami
she
seemed
to
have
been
transformed
by
some
spell
as
titine
had
said
she
was
bewitched
asako
do
you
mean
this
the
big
man
voice
was
harsh
with
grief
do
you
mean
that
i
am
to
go
without
you
asako
still
showed
no
sign
of
comprehension
answer
me
my
darling
do
you
want
me
to
go
her
head
moved
in
assent
and
her
lips
answered
yes
that
whisper
made
such
a
wrench
at
her
husband
heart
that
his
grip
tightened
on
the
frail
and
with
a
nervous
spasm
he
sent
it
clattering
out
of
its
socket
flat
upon
the
floor
of
the
room
like
a
screen
blown
down
by
the
wind
ito
dashed
forward
to
help
geoffrey
replace
the
damage
when
they
turned
round
again
the
two
women
had
disappeared
captain
barrington
said
ito
i
think
you
had
better
go
away
you
make
bad
thing
worse
geoffrey
frowned
at
the
little
creature
he
would
have
liked
to
have
crushed
him
underfoot
like
a
cockroach
but
as
that
was
impossible
nothing
remained
for
him
to
do
but
to
depart
leaving
the
track
of
his
dirty
boots
on
the
shining
corridor
his
last
glimpse
of
his
home
was
of
two
little
scuttering
up
with
dusters
to
remove
the
defilement
asako
had
fainted
as
reggie
had
said
in
chuzenji
what
actually
happens
does
not
matter
it
is
the
thought
of
what
might
have
happened
which
sticks
if
reggie
tolerant
and
experienced
mind
could
not
rid
itself
of
the
picture
conjured
up
by
the
possibility
of
his
friend
treachery
and
his
mistress
lightness
how
could
asako
ignorant
and
untried
hope
to
escape
from
a
far
more
insistent
obsession
she
believed
that
her
husband
was
guilty
but
the
mere
feeling
that
it
was
possible
that
he
might
be
guilty
would
have
been
enough
to
numb
her
love
for
him
at
any
rate
for
a
time
she
had
never
known
heartache
before
she
did
not
realise
that
it
is
a
fever
which
runs
its
appointed
course
of
torment
and
despair
which
at
length
after
a
given
term
abates
and
then
disappears
altogether
leaving
the
sufferer
weak
but
whole
again
the
second
attack
of
the
malady
finds
its
victim
familiar
with
the
symptoms
resigned
to
a
short
period
of
misery
and
confident
of
recovery
a
broken
heart
like
a
broken
horse
is
of
great
service
to
its
owner
but
asako
was
like
one
stricken
with
an
unknown
disease
its
violence
appalled
her
and
in
her
uncertainty
she
prayed
for
death
moreover
she
was
surrounded
by
counsellors
who
traded
on
her
little
faith
who
kept
on
reminding
her
that
she
was
a
japanese
that
she
was
among
her
father
people
who
loved
her
and
understood
her
that
foreigners
were
notoriously
treacherous
to
women
that
they
were
and
that
they
thought
only
of
money
and
material
things
let
her
stay
in
japan
let
her
make
her
home
there
there
she
would
always
be
a
personage
a
member
of
the
family
among
those
big
foreign
women
she
was
overshadowed
and
out
of
place
if
her
husband
left
her
for
a
what
chance
had
she
of
keeping
him
when
once
he
got
back
among
the
women
of
his
own
race
mixed
marriages
in
fact
were
a
mistake
an
offence
against
nature
even
if
he
wished
to
be
faithful
to
her
he
could
not
really
care
for
her
as
he
could
for
an
englishwoman
as
soon
as
geoffrey
barrington
had
left
the
house
ito
went
in
search
of
the
head
of
the
fujinami
whom
he
found
at
work
on
the
latest
literary
production
of
his
tame
students
pinegrove
by
the
fujinami
gentaro
put
his
aside
with
a
leisurely
gesture
for
a
japanese
gentleman
of
culture
must
never
be
in
a
hurry
indeed
it
has
been
so
noisy
composition
has
become
impossible
he
complained
has
that
foreigner
come
to
the
house
he
used
the
uncomplimentary
word
which
may
be
literally
translated
hairy
rascal
it
is
a
survival
from
the
time
of
black
ships
and
the
early
days
of
foreign
intercourse
when
expel
the
barbarians
was
a
watchword
in
the
country
modern
japanese
assure
their
foreign
friends
that
it
has
fallen
altogether
into
disuse
but
such
is
not
the
case
it
is
a
word
loaded
with
all
the
hatred
envy
and
contempt
against
foreigners
of
all
nationalities
which
still
pervade
considerable
sections
of
the
japanese
public
this
barrington
answered
the
lawyer
is
indeed
a
rough
fellow
even
for
a
foreigner
he
came
into
the
house
with
his
boots
on
uninvited
he
shouted
like
a
coolie
and
he
broke
the
his
behaviour
was
like
that
of
in
the
chambers
of
the
perhaps
he
had
been
drinking
a
disgusting
thing
is
it
not
said
the
master
at
this
time
i
am
writing
an
important
chapter
on
the
clear
mirror
of
the
soul
it
is
troublesome
to
be
interrupted
by
these
quarrels
of
women
and
savages
you
will
have
keiichi
and
gor
posted
at
the
door
of
the
house
they
are
to
refuse
entrance
to
all
foreigners
it
must
not
be
allowed
to
turn
our
into
a
battlefield
fujinami
meditations
that
morning
had
been
most
bitter
his
literary
preoccupation
was
only
a
sham
there
was
a
tempest
in
the
political
world
of
japan
the
government
was
tottering
under
the
revelations
of
a
corruption
in
high
places
more
blatant
than
usual
with
the
fall
of
the
cabinet
the
bribes
which
the
fujinami
had
lavished
to
obtain
the
licences
and
privileges
necessary
to
their
trade
would
become
waste
money
true
the
governor
of
osaka
had
not
yet
been
replaced
a
fujinami
familiar
had
been
despatched
thither
at
full
speed
to
secure
the
new
tobita
brothel
concessions
as
a
before
the
inevitable
change
should
take
place
the
head
of
the
house
of
fujinami
therefore
being
a
monarch
in
a
small
way
had
much
to
think
of
besides
the
quarrels
of
women
and
savages
moreover
he
was
not
quite
sure
of
his
ground
with
regard
to
asako
to
take
a
wife
from
her
husband
against
his
will
seems
to
the
japanese
mind
so
flagrantly
illegal
a
proceeding
and
old
fujinami
gennosuké
had
warned
his
irreligious
son
most
gravely
against
the
danger
of
tampering
with
the
testament
of
asako
father
and
of
provoking
thereby
a
visitation
of
his
rough
spirit

reggie
forsyth
remaining
in

had
become
a
prey
to
a
most
crushing
reaction
at
the
time
of
trial
he
had
been
calm
and
for
a
moment
he
had
experienced
a
sensation
of
relief
at
shaking
off
the
shackles
which
yaé
fascination
had
fastened
upon
him
he
had
been
aware
all
along
that
she
was
morally
worthless
he
was
glad
to
have
the
matter
incontestably
proved
but
his
paradise
though
an
artificial
one
had
been
paradise
all
the
same
it
had
nourished
him
with
visions
and

now
he
had
no
companion
except
his
own
irrepressible

jibing
at
his

he
came
to
the
reluctant
conclusion
that
he
must
take
yaé
back
again
but
she
must
never
come
again
to
him
on
the
same
terms
he
would
take
her
for
what
she
really
was
a
unique
and
charming
and
he
knew
that
she
would
be
glad
to
return
without
something
somebody
some
woman
to
interest
him
he
could
not
face
another
year
in
this
barren
land
then
what
about
geoffrey
his
friend
who
had
betrayed
him
no
he
could
not
regard
him
in
such
a
tragic
light
he
was
angry
with
geoffrey
but
not
indignant
he
was
angry
with
him
for
being
a
blunderer
an
elephant
for
being
so
easily
amenable
to
lady
intrigues
for
being
so
stupid
and
gullible
he
argued
that
if
geoffrey
had
been
a
wicked
seducer
a
bold
don
juan
he
would
have
excused
him
and
would
have
felt
more
sympathy
for
him
he
would
have
thoroughly
enjoyed
sitting
down
with
him
to
a
discussion
of
psychology
but
what
did
an
oaf
like
geoffrey
understand
about
that
bundle
of
nerves
and
instincts
partly
primitive
and
partly
artificial
bred
out
of
an
abnormal
cross
between
east
and
west
and
doomed
from
conception
to
a
life
astray
between
light
and
darkness
he
had
been
disillusioned
about
his
old
friend
and
he
wished
never
to
see
him
again
what
frauds
these
noble
natures
are
he
said
to
himself
these
old
honests
these
sterling
souls
and
as
an
excuse
he
tells
me
actually
happened
disgusting
play
with
light
loves
in
the
portal
to
kiss
and
embrace
and
refrain
the
virtue
of
our
days
is
mostly
impotence
lust
and
passion
and
love
and
marriage
why
do
our
dull
insular
minds
mix
up
these
four
entirely
separate
notions
and
how
can
we
jump
with
such
agility
from
one
circle
of
thought
into
another
without
ever
noticing
the
change
in
the
landscape
he
strolled
over
to
the
piano
to
put
these
ideas
into
music
lady
cynthia
had
decided
that
it
would
be
bad
for
him
to
stop
in
chuzenji
mountain
scenery
is
demoralising
for
a
nature
so
byronic
he
was
forthwith
despatched
to
tokyo
to
represent
his
embassy
at
a
requiem
mass
to
be
celebrated
for
the
souls
of
an
austrian
archduke
and
his
wife
who
had
recently
been
assassinated
by
a
serbian
fanatic
somewhere
in
bosnia
reggie
was
furious
at
having
to
undertake
this
mission
for
the
mountains
were
soothing
to
him
and
he
was
not
yet
ready
for
encounters
when
he
arrived
in
tokyo
he
was
in
a
very
bad
temper
asako
had
heard
from
tanaka
that
reggie
forsyth
was
expected
at
the
embassy
that
useful
had
been
posted
by
the
fujinami
to
keep
watch
on
the
embassy
compound
and
to
report
any
movements
of
importance
for
the
conspirators
were
not
entirely
at
ease
as
to
the
legality
of
abducting
the
wife
of
a
british
subject
and
keeping
her
against
her
husband
demands
asako
had
received
that
day
a
pathetic
letter
from
geoffrey
giving
detail
for
detail
his
account
of
his
dealings
with
yaé
smith
begging
her
to
understand
and
believe
him
and
to
forgive
him
for
the
crime
which
he
had
never
committed
in
spite
of
her
cousin
incredulity
asako
resolution
was
shaken
by
this
appeal
at
last
now
that
she
had
lost
her
husband
she
was
beginning
to
realise
how
very
much
she
loved
him
reggie
forsyth
would
be
a
more
or
less
impartial
witness
late
that
evening
in
a
hooded
rickshaw
she
crossed
the
short
distance
which
led
to
the
embassy
forsyth
had
just
arrived
forsyth
was
very
displeased
to
hear
barrington
announced
it
was
just
the
kind
of
meeting
which
would
exasperate
and
unnerve
him
her
appearance
was
against
her
she
wore
a
japanese
kimono
unpleasantly
reminiscent
of
yaé
her
hair
was
disordered
and
her
eyes
were
red
with
weeping
let
me
say
at
once
observed
reggie
as
he
offered
her
a
chair
that
i
am
in
no
way
responsible
for
your
husband
shortcomings
i
have
too
many
of
my
own
asako
could
never
understand
reggie
when
he
talked
in
that
sarcastic
tone
i
want
to
know
exactly
what
happened
she
begged
i
have
no
one
else
who
can
tell
me
your
husband
says
that
nothing
actually
happened
replied
reggie
brutally
the
girl
realised
that
this
statement
was
far
from
being
the
vindication
of
geoffrey
which
she
had
begun
to
hope
for
but
what
did
you
actually
see
she
asked
i
saw
miss
smith
with
your
husband
as
it
was
in
my
house
they
might
have
asked
my
leave
first
asako
shivered
but
do
you
think
geoffrey
had
been
to
miss
smith
i
do
know
said
reggie
wearily
from
what
i
heard
i
think
miss
smith
was
doing
most
of
the
to
geoffrey
but
he
did
not
seem
to
object
to
the
process
asako
yearnings
for
proof
of
her
husband
innocence
were
crushed
what
shall
i
do
she
pleaded
i
sure
i
do
know
this
scene
to
reggie
was
becoming
positively
silly
take
him
back
to
england
as
soon
as
possible
i
should
think
but
would
he
fall
in
love
with
women
in
england
possibly
then
what
am
i
to
do
grin
and
bear
it
that
what
we
all
have
to
do
oh
forsyth
asako
implored
you
know
my
husband
so
well
do
you
think
he
is
a
bad
man
no
not
worse
than
the
rest
of
us
answered
reggie
who
felt
quite
maddened
by
this
talk
he
is
a
bit
of
a
fool
and
a
good
deal
of
a
blunderer
but
do
you
think
geoffrey
was
to
blame
for
what
happened
i
have
told
you
my
dear
barrington
that
your
husband
assured
me
that
nothing
actually
happened
i
am
quite
sure
this
is
true
for
your
husband
is
a
very
honourable
man
in
details
you
mean
said
asako
gulping
out
the
words
that
miss
smith
was
not
actually
geoffrey
mistress
they
did
not
sin
together
asako
did
not
know
how
intimate
were
the
relations
between
reggie
and
yaé
she
did
not
understand
therefore
how
cruelly
her
words
lanced
him
but
more
than
the
shafts
of
memory
it
was
the
imbecility
of
the
whole
scene
which
almost
made
the
young
man
scream
exactly
he
answered
in
the
words
of
the
bible
she
lay
with
him
but
he
knew
her
not
then
do
you
think
i
ought
to
forgive
geoffrey
this
was
too
much
reggie
leaped
to
his
feet
my
dear
lady
that
is
really
a
question
for
yourself
and
yourself
alone
personally
i
do
not
at
present
feel
like
forgiving
anybody
least
of
all
can
i
forgive
fools
geoffrey
harrington
is
a
fool
he
was
a
fool
to
marry
a
fool
to
marry
you
a
fool
to
come
to
japan
when
everybody
warned
him
not
to
a
fool
to
talk
to
yaé
when
everybody
told
him
that
she
was
a
dangerous
woman
no
personally
at
present
i
can
not
forgive
geoffrey
barrington
but
it
is
very
late
and
i
am
very
tired
and
i
sure
you
are
too
i
would
advise
you
to
go
home
to
your
erring
husband
and
morning
we
shall
all
be
thinking
more
clearly
as
the
french
say
raccommode
asako
still
made
no
movement
well
dear
lady
if
you
wish
to
wait
longer
you
will
excuse
me
if
instead
of
talking
rot
i
play
to
you
it
is
more
soothing
to
the
nerves
he
sat
down
at
the
piano
and
struck
up
the
chorus
i
go
off
to
maxim
i
done
with
lovers
dreams
the
girls
will
laugh
and
greet
me
they
will
not
trick
and
cheat
me
lolo
dodo
joujou
cloclo
margot
i
going
off
to
maxim
and
you
may
go
to
the
pianist
swung
around
on
his
stool
his
visitor
had
gone
thank
god
he
sighed
and
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
was
asleep
he
awoke
in
the
small
hours
with
that
sick
restless
feeling
on
his
chest
which
he
described
as
a
conviction
of
sin
good
god
he
said
aloud
what
a
cad
i
been
he
realised
that
an
unspoiled
and
gentle
creature
had
paid
him
the
greatest
of
all
compliments
by
coming
to
him
for
advice
in
the
extremity
of
her
soul
misery
he
had
received
her
with
silly
and
cheap
cynicism
at
breakfast
he
learned
that
things
were
much
more
serious
than
he
had
imagined
that
asako
had
actually
left
her
husband
and
was
living
with
her
japanese
cousins
what
he
had
thought
to
be
a
lover
quarrel
he
now
recognised
to
be
the
shipwreck
of
two
lives
with
a
kindly
word
he
might
have
prevented
this
disaster
he
drove
straight
to
the
fujinami
mansion
at
the
risk
of
being
late
for
the
requiem
mass
he
found
two
hooligans
posted
at
the
gate
who
stopped
his
rickshaw
and
informing
him
that
none
of
the
fujinami
family
were
at
home
seemed
prepared
to
resist
his
entry
with
force
during
the
reception
of
the
austrian
embassy
which
followed
the
mass
an
incident
occurred
which
altered
the
whole
set
of
the
young
diplomat
thoughts
and
most
surprisingly
sent
him
posting
down
to
the
imperial
hotel
to
find
geoffrey
harrington
as
one
who
has
discovered
a
treasure
and
must
share
it
with
his
friend
the
big
englishman
was
contemplating
a
in
the
hall
of
the
hotel
it
was
by
no
means
the
first
of
its
series
he
gazed
dully
at
reggie
thought
you
were
at
chuzenji
he
said
thickly
i
had
to
come
down
for
the
special
service
for
the
archduke
franz
ferdinand
said
reggie
excitedly
they
gave
us
a
regular
wake
champagne
by
the
gallon
several
of
the
became
inspired
they
saw
visions
and
made
prophesyings
von
falkenturm
the
german
military
attache
was
shouting
out
got
to
fight
going
to
fight
we
do
care
who
we
fight
russia
france
england
yes
the
whole
lot
of
them
the
man
was
drunk
of
course
but
after
all
vino
the
rest
of
the
were
getting
very
rattled
and
at
last
they
succeeded
in
suppressing
falkenturm
but
i
tell
you
geoffrey
it
coming
at
last
it
really
coming
what
coming
why
the
great
war
thank
god
it
coming
why
thank
god
because
we
all
become
too
artificial
and
beastly
we
want
exterminating
and
to
start
afresh
we
shall
escape
at
last
from
women
and
and
silly
gossip
we
shall
become
men
it
will
give
us
all
something
to
do
and
something
to
think
about
yes
echoed
geoffrey
i
wish
i
could
get
something
to
do
you
get
it
all
right
i
wish
i
were
a
soldier
are
you
going
to
stop
in
japan
much
longer
no
going
next
week
going
home
look
here
i
put
in
my
resignation
right
away
and
i
come
along
with
you
no
thanks
said
geoffrey
rather
not
in
his
excitement
reggie
had
failed
to
observe
the
chilliness
of
his
friend
demeanour
this
snub
direct
brought
up
the
whole
chain
of
events
which
reggie
had
momentarily
forgotten
or
which
were
too
recent
as
yet
to
have
assumed
complete
reality
i
sorry
geoffrey
he
said
as
he
rose
to
go
not
at
all
said
barrington
ignoring
his
friend
hand
and
turning
aside
to
order
another
drink
geoffrey
had
a
letter
in
his
pocket
received
from
his
wife
that
morning
it
ran
dear
geoffrey
i
am
very
sorry
i
can
not
come
back
it
is
not
only
what
has
happened
i
am
japanese
you
are
english
you
can
never
really
love
me
our
marriage
was
a
mistake
everybody
says
so
even
reggie
forsyth
i
tried
my
best
to
want
to
come
back
i
went
to
reggie
last
night
and
asked
him
what
actually
happened
he
says
that
our
marriage
was
a
mistake
and
that
our
coming
to
japan
was
a
mistake
so
do
i
think
we
might
have
been
happy
in
england
i
want
you
to
divorce
me
it
seems
to
be
very
easy
in
japan
you
only
have
to
write
a
letter
which
ito
will
give
you
then
i
can
become
quite
japanese
again
and
fujinami
can
take
me
back
into
his
family
also
you
will
be
free
to
marry
an
english
girl
but
do
have
anything
to
do
with
miss
smith
she
is
a
very
bad
girl
i
shall
never
marry
anybody
else
my
cousins
are
very
kind
to
me
it
is
much
better
for
me
to
stay
in
japan
titine
said
i
was
wrong
to
go
away
please
give
her
fifty
pounds
from
me
and
send
her
back
to
france
if
she
wants
to
go
i
think
it
is
good
for
us
to
see
each
other
we
only
make
each
other
unhappy
tanaka
is
here
i
do
not
like
him
now
your
loving
asako
from
this
letter
geoffrey
understood
that
reggie
forsyth
also
was
against
him
the
request
for
a
divorce
baffled
him
entirely
how
could
he
divorce
his
wife
when
he
had
nothing
against
her
in
answer
he
wrote
another
frantic
appeal
to
her
to
return
to
him
there
was
no
answer
then
he
left
tokyo
for
yokohama
it
is
only
eighteen
miles
away
to
wait
there
until
his
boat
started
thither
he
was
pursued
by
ito
i
am
sorry
for
you
the
revolting
little
man
always
began
his
discourse
now
with
this
exasperating
phrase
barrington
would
like
very
much
to
obtain
the
divorce
she
wishes
very
much
to
have
her
name
inscribed
on
family
register
of
fujinami
house
if
there
is
no
divorce
this
is
not
possible
but
objected
geoffrey
it
is
not
so
easy
to
get
divorced
as
to
get
married
unfortunately
in
japan
said
the
lawyer
it
is
more
easy
because
we
have
different
custom
then
there
must
be
a
lot
of
divorces
said
geoffrey
grimly
there
are
very
many
answered
the
japanese
more
than
in
any
other
country
in
divorce
japan
leads
the
world
even
the
states
come
second
to
our
country
among
the
persons
in
japan
there
are
even
women
who
have
been
married
times
married
properly
honourably
and
legally
in
upper
society
too
many
divorce
but
not
so
many
for
it
makes
the
family
angry
marvellous
said
geoffrey
how
do
you
do
it
there
is
divorce
by
as
in
your
country
said
ito
the
injured
party
can
sue
the
other
party
and
the
court
can
grant
decree
but
very
few
japanese
persons
go
to
the
court
for
divorce
it
is
not
nice
as
you
say
to
wash
dirty
shirt
before
all
people
so
there
is
divorce
by
custom
well
asked
the
englishman
now
as
you
know
our
marriage
is
also
by
custom
there
is
no
ceremony
of
religion
unless
parties
desire
only
the
man
and
the
woman
go
to
the
to
the
office
of
the
city
or
the
village
and
the
man
say
woman
is
my
wife
please
write
her
name
on
the
register
of
my
family
then
when
he
want
to
divorce
her
he
goes
again
to
the
office
of
the
city
and
says
have
sent
my
wife
away
please
take
her
name
from
the
register
of
my
family
and
write
it
again
on
the
register
of
her
father
family
you
see
our
custom
is
very
convenient
no
expense
no
trouble
very
convenient
geoffrey
agreed
so
if
captain
barrington
will
come
with
me
to
the
office
of
akasaka
tokyo
and
will
give
notice
that
he
has
sent
barrington
back
to
her
family
then
the
divorce
is
finished
barrington
becomes
again
a
japanese
subject
her
name
becomes
fujinami
she
is
again
one
of
her
family
this
is
her
prayer
to
you
and
barrington
money
asked
geoffrey
sarcastically
you
have
forgotten
that
oh
no
was
the
answer
we
do
forget
the
money
fujinami
quite
understand
that
it
is
great
loss
to
send
away
barrington
he
will
give
big
compensation
as
much
as
captain
barrington
desires
to
ito
surprise
his
victim
left
the
table
and
did
not
return
so
he
inquired
from
the
servants
about
captain
barrington
habits
and
learned
from
the
that
the
big
englishman
drank
plenty
but
he
did
not
talk
to
any
one
or
go
to
the
brothels
perhaps
he
was
a
little
mad
ito
returned
to
the
charge
next
day
this
time
geoffrey
had
an
inspiration
he
said
that
if
he
could
be
granted
an
interview
alone
with
asako
he
would
discuss
with
her
the
divorce
project
and
would
consent
if
she
asked
him
personally
after
some
demur
the
lawyer
agreed
the
last
interview
between
husband
and
wife
took
place
in
office
which
geoffrey
had
visited
once
before
in
his
search
for
the
fortune
of
the
fujinami
the
scene
of
the
rendezvous
was
well
chosen
to
repress
any
revival
of
old
emotions
the
varnished
furniture
the
sham
mahogany
the
purple
plush
upholstery
the
gilt
french
clock
the
dirty
bust
of
abraham
lincoln
and
the
polyglot
law
library
checked
the
tender
word
and
the
generous
impulse
the
japanese
have
an
instinctive
knowledge
of
the
influence
of
inanimate
things
and
use
this
knowledge
with
an
unscrupulousness
which
the
crude
foreigner
only
realises
if
ever
after
it
is
too
late
geoffrey
wife
appeared
hand
in
hand
with
cousin
sadako
there
was
nothing
english
in
her
looks
she
had
become
completely
japanese
from
her
black
to
the
little
white
feet
which
shuffled
over
the
dusty
carpet
there
was
no
the
two
women
sat
down
stiffly
on
chairs
against
the
wall
remote
from
geoffrey
like
two
swallows
perched
uneasily
on
an
unsteady
wire
asako
held
a
fan
there
was
complete
silence
i
wish
to
see
my
wife
alone
said
geoffrey
he
spoke
to
ito
who
grinned
with
embarrassment
and
looked
at
the
two
women
asako
shook
her
head
i
made
it
quite
clear
to
you
ito
said
geoffrey
angrily
that
this
was
my
condition
i
understand
that
pressure
has
been
used
to
keep
my
wife
away
from
me
i
will
apply
to
my
embassy
to
get
her
restored
ito
muttered
under
his
breath
that
was
a
contingency
which
he
had
greatly
dreaded
he
turned
to
sadako
fujinami
and
spoke
to
her
in
voluble
japanese
sadako
whispered
in
her
cousin
ear
then
she
rose
and
withdrew
with
ito
geoffrey
was
left
alone
with
asako
but
was
she
really
the
same
asako
geoffrey
had
often
seen
upper
class
japanese
ladies
at
receptions
in
the
hotel
at
tokyo
he
had
thought
how
picturesque
they
were
how
well
mannered
how
excellent
their
taste
in
dress
but
they
had
seemed
to
him
quite
unreal
denizens
of
a
shadow
world
of
bowing
gliding
figures
he
now
realised
that
his
former
wife
had
become
entirely
a
japanese
a
person
absolutely
different
from
himself
a
visitant
from
another
sphere
he
was
english
she
was
japanese
they
were
divorced
already
the
big
man
rose
from
his
chair
and
held
out
his
hand
to
his
wife
i
sorry
little
asako
he
said
very
gently
you
are
quite
right
it
was
a
mistake
and
god
bless
you
always
with
immense
relief
and
gratitude
she
took
the
giant
paw
in
her
own
tiny
hand
it
seemed
to
have
lost
its
grip
to
have
become
like
a
japanese
hand
he
opened
the
door
for
her
once
again
as
on
the
of
george
the
tall
shoulders
bent
over
the
tiny
figure
with
a
movement
of
instinctive
protection
and
tenderness
he
closed
the
door
behind
her
recrossed
the
room
and
stared
into
the
empty
fireplace
after
a
time
ito
returned
the
two
men
went
together
to
the
district
office
of
the
akasaka
ward
there
geoffrey
signed
a
declaration
in
japanese
and
english
to
the
effect
that
his
marriage
with
asako
fujinami
was
cancelled
and
that
she
was
free
to
return
to
her
father
family
next
morning
at
daylight
his
ship
left
yokohama
before
he
reached
liverpool
war
had
been
declared

i

how
vast
is
the
asako
barrington
was
restored
to
the
name
and
home
of
the
fujinami
her
action
had
been
the
result
of
hereditary
instinct
of
the
natural
current
of
circumstances
and
of
the
adroit
diplomacy
of
her
relatives
she
had
been
hunted
and
caught
like
a
wild
animal
and
she
was
soon
to
find
that
the
walls
of
her
enclosure
which
at
first
seemed
so
wide
that
she
perceived
them
not
were
closing
in
upon
her
day
by
day
as
in
a
mediaeval
torture
chamber
forcing
her
step
by
step
towards
the
unfathomable
pit
of
japanese
matrimony
the
fujinami
had
not
adopted
their
foreign
cousin
out
of
pure
altruism
far
from
it
like
japanese
in
general
they
resented
the
intrusion
of
a
outside
person
into
their
intimacy
they
took
her
for
what
she
was
worth
to
them
since
asako
was
now
a
member
of
the
family
custom
allowed
fujinami
gentaro
to
control
her
money
but
ito
warned
his
patron
that
legally
the
money
was
still
hers
and
hers
alone
and
that
in
case
of
her
marrying
a
second
time
it
might
again
slip
away
it
was
imperative
therefore
to
the
policy
of
the
fujinami
house
that
asako
should
marry
a
fujinami
and
that
as
soon
as
possible
a
difficulty
here
arose
not
that
asako
might
object
to
her
new
husband
it
never
occurred
to
the
fujinami
that
this
stranger
from
europe
might
have
opinions
quite
opposed
to
japanese
conventions
but
that
there
were
very
few
adequately
qualified
suitors
indeed
in
the
direct
line
of
succession
there
was
only
young
fujinami
takeshi
the
youth
with
the
purple
blotches
who
had
distinguished
himself
by
his
wit
and
his
on
the
night
of
the
first
family
banquet
true
he
had
a
wife
already
but
she
could
easily
be
divorced
as
her
family
were
nobodies
if
he
married
asako
however
was
he
still
capable
of
breeding
healthy
children
of
course
he
might
adopt
the
children
whom
he
already
possessed
by
his
first
wife
but
the
elder
boy
showed
signs
of
being
mentally
deficient
the
younger
was
certainly
deaf
and
dumb
and
the
two
others
were
girls
and
did
not
count
grandfather
fujinami
gennosuké
who
hated
and
despised
his
grandson
was
for
sweeping
him
and
his
brood
out
of
the
way
altogether
and
for
adopting
a
carefully
selected
and
creditable
adopted
son
by
marriage
with
either
sadako
or
asako
but
if
this
asa
is
barren
said
fujinami
shidzuyé
who
naturally
desired
that
her
daughter
sadako
husband
should
be
the
heir
of
the
fujinami
that
englishman
was
strong
and
healthy
there
was
living
together
for
more
than
a
year
and
still
no
child
if
she
is
barren
then
a
son
must
be
adopted
said
the
old
gentleman
to
adopt
twice
in
succession
is
unlucky
objected
fujinami
gentaro
then
said
shidzuyé
the
old
woman
of
akabo
shall
come
for
consultation
she
shall
tell
if
it
is
possible
for
her
to
have
babies
akabo
was
the
village
whence
the
first
fujinami
had
come
to
tokyo
to
seek
his
fortune
the
japanese
never
completely
loses
touch
with
his
ancestral
village
and
for
over
a
hundred
years
the
tokyo
fujinami
had
paid
their
annual
visit
to
the
mountains
of
the
north
to
render
tribute
to
the
graves
of
their
forefathers
they
still
preserved
an
inherited
faith
in
the
wise
woman
of
the
district
who
from
time
to
time
was
summoned
to
the
capital
to
give
her
advice
their
other
medical
counselor
was
professor
kashio
who
held
degrees
from
munich
and
vienna
during
the
first
days
of
her
widowhood
asako
was
little
better
than
a
convalescent
she
had
never
looked
at
sorrow
before
and
the
shock
of
what
she
had
seen
had
paralyzed
her
vitality
without
as
yet
opening
her
understanding
like
a
dog
who
in
the
midst
of
his
faithful
affection
has
been
struck
for
a
fault
of
which
he
is
unconscious
she
took
refuge
in
darkness
solitude
and
despair
the
japanese
who
are
as
a
rule
intuitively
aware
of
others
emotions
recognized
her
case
a
room
was
prepared
for
her
in
a
distant
wing
of
the
straggling
house
a
room
in
an
upper
story
with
glass
in
the
windows
stained
glass
too
with
white
muslin
blinds
a
colored
lithograph
of
napoleon
and
a
real
bed
recently
purchased
on
sadako
pleading
that
everything
must
be
done
to
make
life
happy
for
their
guest
but
she
is
a
japanese
fujinami
gentaro
had
objected
it
is
not
right
that
a
japanese
should
sleep
upon
a
tall
bed
she
must
learn
to
give
up
luxurious
ways
sadako
protested
that
her
cousin
health
was
not
yet
assured
and
so
discipline
was
relaxed
for
a
time
asako
spent
most
of
her
days
in
the
tall
bed
gazing
through
the
open
doorway
across
the
polished
wood
veranda
like
the
toffee
veranda
of
a
confectioner
model
past
the
wandering
branch
of
an
old
twisted
which
crouched
by
the
side
of
the
mansion
like
a
faithful
beast
over
the
pigmy
landscape
of
the
garden
to
the
roofs
of
the
distant
city
and
to
the
pagoda
on
the
opposite
hill
it
rested
her
to
lie
thus
and
look
at
her
country
from
time
to
time
sadako
would
steal
into
the
room
her
cousin
would
leave
the
invalid
in
silence
but
she
always
smiled
and
she
would
bring
some
offering
with
her
a
dish
of
food
asako
favorite
dishes
of
which
tanaka
had
already
compiled
a
complete
list
or
sometimes
a
flower
at
the
open
door
she
would
pause
to
shuffle
off
her
pale
blue
sandals
and
she
would
glide
across
the
clean
matting
shod
in
her
only
asako
gradually
accustomed
herself
to
the
noises
of
the
house
first
there
was
the
clattering
of
the
the
wooden
shutters
whose
removal
announced
the
beginning
of
the
day
then
the
gurgling
and
the
expectorations
which
accompanied
the
family
ablutions
then
the
harsh
sound
of
the
men
voices
and
their
rattling
laughter
the
sound
of
their
on
the
gravel
paths
of
the
garden
like
the
tedious
dropping
of
heavy
rain
on
an
iron
roof
then
the
flicking
and
dusting
of
the
maids
as
they
went
about
their
daily
their
shrill
mouselike
chirps
and
their
silly
giggle
then
the
afternoon
stillness
when
every
one
was
absent
or
sleeping
and
then
the
revival
of
life
and
bustle
at
about
six
when
the
clogs
were
shuffled
off
at
the
front
door
when
the
teacups
began
to
jingle
and
when
sounds
of
swishing
water
came
up
from
the
the
crackle
of
the
under
the
bathtub
the
smell
of
the
burning
logs
and
the
distant
odours
of
the
kitchen
outside
the
twilight
was
beginning
to
gather
a
big
black
crow
flopped
lazily
on
to
the
branch
of
the
neighbouring
his
harsh
croak
disturbed
asako
mind
like
a
threat
high
overhead
passed
a
flight
of
wild
geese
in
military
formation
on
their
way
to
the
continent
of
asia
lights
began
to
peep
among
the
trees
behind
the
squat
pagoda
a
sky
of
raspberry
pink
closed
the
background
the
twilight
is
brief
in
japan
the
night
is
velvety
and
the
moonlight
and
the
starlight
transfigure
the
dolls
house
architecture
the
warped
the
feathery
bamboo
clumps
and
the
pagoda
spires
from
a
downstair
room
there
came
the
twang
of
cousin
sadako
a
kind
of
zither
instrument
upon
which
she
played
interminable
melancholy
sonatas
of
liquid
detached
notes
like
desultory
thoughts
against
a
background
of
silence
there
was
no
accompaniment
to
this
music
and
no
song
to
chime
with
it
for
as
the
japanese
say
the
accompaniment
for
music
is
the
summer
and
its
heavy
fragrance
and
the
voice
with
which
it
harmonizes
is
the
whisper
of
the
breeze
in
the
long
after
sadako
had
finished
her
practice
came
borne
upon
the
distance
the
still
more
melancholy
pipe
of
a
student
flute
this
was
the
last
human
sound
after
that
the
night
was
left
to
the
orchestra
of
the
insects
the
grasshoppers
the
crickets
and
the
cicadas
asako
soon
was
able
to
distinguish
at
least
ten
or
twelve
different
songs
all
metallic
in
character
like
clock
springs
being
slowly
wound
up
and
then
let
down
with
a
run
the
night
and
the
house
vibrated
with
these
infinitesimal
chromatics
sometimes
asako
thought
the
creatures
must
have
got
into
her
room
and
feared
for
entanglements
in
her
hair
then
she
remembered
that
her
nickname
had
been
the
and
that
she
had
been
so
called
because
she
was
always
happy
and
singing
in
her
little
house
by
the
river
this
memory
roused
asako
one
day
with
a
wish
to
see
how
her
own
house
was
progressing
this
wish
was
the
first
positive
thought
which
had
stirred
her
mind
since
her
husband
had
left
her
and
it
marked
a
stage
in
her
convalescence
if
the
house
is
ready
she
thought
i
will
go
there
soon
the
fujinamis
will
not
want
me
to
live
here
permanently
this
showed
how
little
she
understood
as
yet
the
japanese
family
system
whereby
relatives
remain
as
permanent
guests
for
years
on
end
tanaka
she
said
one
morning
in
what
was
almost
her
old
manner
i
think
i
will
have
the
motor
car
tanaka
had
become
her
body
servant
as
in
the
old
days
at
first
she
had
resented
the
man
reappearance
which
awakened
such
cruel
memories
she
had
protested
against
him
to
sadako
who
had
smiled
and
promised
but
tanaka
continued
his
ministrations
and
asako
had
not
the
strength
to
go
on
protesting
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
specially
employed
by
fujinami
gentaro
to
spy
on
movements
an
easy
task
hitherto
since
she
had
not
moved
from
her
room
where
is
the
motor
car
tanaka
she
asked
again
he
grinned
as
japanese
always
do
when
embarrassed
very
sorry
for
you
he
answered
motor
car
has
gone
away
has
captain
barrington
asako
began
instinctively
then
remembering
that
geoffrey
was
now
many
thousands
of
miles
from
japan
she
turned
her
face
to
the
wall
and
began
to
cry
young
fujinami
san
said
tanaka
has
taken
motor
car
he
go
away
to
mountains
with
girl
very
bad
young
fujinami
san
very
asako
thought
that
it
was
rather
impertinent
to
borrow
her
own
motor
car
without
asking
permission
even
if
she
was
their
guest
she
did
not
yet
understand
that
she
and
all
her
possessions
belonged
from
henceforth
to
her
family
to
her
male
relatives
that
is
to
say
for
she
was
only
a
woman
old
fujinami
san
tanaka
went
on
happy
to
find
his
mistress
to
whom
he
was
attached
in
a
queer
japanese
sort
of
way
interested
and
responsive
at
last
old
fujinami
san
he
also
go
to
mountain
with
girl
but
different
mountain
japanese
people
all
very
all
japanese
people
like
to
go
away
in
summer
season
with
girl
very
bad
custom
old
fujinami
san
not
so
very
bad
keep
same
girl
very
long
time
perhaps
ladyship
see
one
little
girl
very
nice
little
girl
come
sometimes
with
miss
sadako
and
bring
things
that
little
girl
is
daughter
perhaps
old
fujinami
san
daughter
also
i
think
very
bastard
i
do
know
so
he
rambled
on
in
the
fashion
of
servants
all
the
world
over
until
asako
knew
all
the
ramifications
of
her
relatives
legitimate
and
illegitimate
she
gathered
that
the
men
had
all
left
tokyo
during
the
hot
season
and
that
only
the
women
were
left
in
the
house
this
encouraged
her
to
descend
from
her
eyrie
and
to
endeavour
to
take
up
her
position
in
her
family
which
was
beginning
to
appear
the
less
reassuring
the
more
she
learned
about
its
history
the
life
of
a
japanese
lady
of
quality
is
peculiarly
tedious
she
is
relieved
from
the
domestic
cares
which
give
occupation
to
her
humbler
sisters
but
she
is
not
treated
as
an
equal
or
as
a
companion
by
her
menfolk
who
are
taught
that
marriage
is
for
business
and
not
for
pleasure
and
consequently
that
is
a
bore
she
is
supposed
to
find
her
own
amusements
such
as
music
and
the
composition
of
poetry
more
often
this
refined
and
innocent
ideal
degenerates
into
a
poor
trickle
of
an
existence
enlivened
only
by
scrappy
magazine
reading
gossip
empty
chatter
about
clothes
neighbours
and
children
backbiting
envying
and
malice
once
sadako
took
her
cousin
to
a
charity
entertainment
given
for
the
red
cross
at
the
house
of
a
rich
nobleman
a
hundred
or
more
ladies
were
present
but
stiff
civility
prevailed
none
of
the
guests
seemed
to
know
each
other
there
was
no
friendly
talking
there
were
no
men
guests
there
was
three
hours
agony
of
squatting
a
careful
adjustment
of
expensive
kimonos
weak
tea
and
tasteless
cakes
a
blank
staring
at
a
dull
conjuring
performance
and
deadly
silence
do
you
ever
have
dances
asako
asked
her
cousin
the
dance
because
they
are
paid
said
sadako
primly
her
pose
was
no
longer
cordial
and
sympathetic
she
set
herself
up
as
mentor
to
this
young
savage
who
did
not
know
the
usages
of
civilized
society
no
not
like
that
said
the
girl
from
england
but
dancing
among
yourselves
with
your
men
friends
oh
no
that
would
not
be
nice
at
all
only
tipsy
persons
would
dance
like
that
asako
tried
not
very
successfully
to
chat
in
easy
japanese
with
her
cousin
but
she
fled
from
the
interminable
talking
parties
of
her
relatives
where
she
could
not
understand
one
word
except
the
innumerable
parentheses
indeed
and
is
it
so
with
which
the
conversation
was
studded
as
the
realization
of
her
solitude
made
her
nerves
more
jumpy
she
began
to
imagine
that
the
women
were
forever
talking
about
her
criticizing
her
unfavorably
and
disposing
of
her
future
the
only
man
whom
she
saw
during
the
hot
summer
months
besides
the
inevitable
tanaka
was
ito
the
lawyer
he
could
talk
quite
good
english
he
was
not
so
egotistical
and
bitter
as
sadako
he
had
traveled
in
america
and
europe
he
seemed
to
understand
the
trouble
of
asako
mind
and
would
offer
sympathetic
advice
it
is
difficult
to
go
to
school
when
we
are
no
longer
children
he
would
say
sententiously
asa
san
must
be
patient
asa
san
must
forget
asa
san
must
take
japanese
husband
i
think
it
is
the
only
way
oh
no
the
poor
girl
shivered
i
would
marry
again
for
anything
but
ito
went
on
relentlessly
it
is
hurtful
to
the
body
when
once
it
has
custom
to
be
married
i
think
that
is
reason
why
so
many
widow
women
are
unfortunate
and
become
mad
every
day
he
would
spend
an
hour
or
so
in
conversation
with
asako
she
thought
that
this
was
a
sign
of
friendliness
and
sympathy
as
a
matter
of
fact
his
object
at
first
was
to
improve
his
english
later
on
more
ambitious
projects
developed
in
his
fertile
brain
he
would
talk
about
new
york
and
london
in
his
queer
stilted
way
he
had
been
a
fireman
on
board
ship
a
teacher
of
a
juggler
a
quack
dentist
heaven
knows
what
else
driven
by
the
conscientious
inquisitiveness
of
his
race
he
had
endured
hardships
contempt
and
rough
treatment
with
the
smiling
patience
inculcated
in
the
japanese
people
by
their
education
we
must
chew
our
gall
and
bide
our
time
they
say
when
the
too
powerful
foreigner
insults
or
abuses
them
he
had
seen
the
magnificence
of
our
cities
the
vastness
of
our
undertakings
and
had
returned
to
japan
with
great
relief
to
find
that
life
among
his
own
people
was
less
strenuous
and
fierce
that
it
was
ordered
by
circumstances
and
the
family
system
that
less
was
left
to
individual
courage
and
enterprise
that
things
happened
more
often
than
things
were
done
the
impersonality
of
japan
was
as
restful
to
him
as
it
is
aggravating
to
a
european
but
it
must
not
be
imagined
that
ito
was
an
idle
man
on
the
contrary
he
was
exceedingly
hard
working
and
ambitious
his
dream
was
to
become
a
statesman
to
enjoy
unlimited
patronage
to
make
men
and
to
break
men
and
to
die
a
peer
when
he
returned
to
japan
from
his
wanderings
with
exactly
two
shillings
in
his
pocket
this
was
his
programme
like
cecil
rhodes
his
hero
among
white
men
he
made
a
will
distributing
millions
then
he
attached
himself
to
his
rich
cousins
the
fujinami
and
very
soon
he
became
indispensable
to
them
fujinami
gentaro
an
indolent
man
gave
him
more
and
more
authority
over
the
family
fortune
it
was
dirty
business
this
buying
of
girls
and
hiring
of
pimps
but
it
was
immensely
profitable
and
more
and
more
of
the
profits
found
their
way
into
ito
private
account
fujinami
gentaro
did
not
seem
to
care
takeshi
the
son
and
heir
was
a
nonentity
ito
intention
was
to
continue
to
serve
his
cousins
until
he
had
amassed
a
working
capital
of
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
then
he
would
go
into
politics
but
the
advent
of
asako
suggested
a
short
cut
to
his
hopes
if
he
married
her
he
would
gain
immediate
control
of
a
large
interest
in
the
fujinami
estate
besides
she
had
all
the
qualifications
for
the
wife
of
a
cabinet
minister
knowledge
of
foreign
languages
ease
in
foreign
society
experience
of
foreign
dress
and
customs
moreover
passion
was
stirring
in
his
heart
the
swift
stormy
passion
of
the
japanese
male
which
when
thwarted
drives
him
towards
murder
and
suicide
like
many
japanese
he
had
felt
the
attractiveness
of
foreign
women
when
he
was
traveling
abroad
their
independence
stimulated
him
their
savagery
and
their
masterful
ways
ito
had
found
in
asako
the
physical
beauty
of
his
own
race
together
with
the
character
and
energy
which
had
pleased
him
so
much
in
white
women
everything
seemed
to
favor
his
suit
asako
clearly
seemed
to
prefer
his
company
to
that
of
other
members
of
the
family
he
had
a
hold
over
the
fujinami
which
would
compel
them
to
assent
to
anything
he
might
require
true
he
had
a
wife
already
but
she
could
easily
be
divorced
asako
tolerated
him
de
cousin
sadako
was
becoming
tired
of
their
system
of
mutual
instruction
as
she
tired
sooner
or
later
of
everything
she
had
developed
a
romantic
interest
in
one
of
the
pet
students
whom
the
fujinami
kept
as
an
advertisement
and
a
bodyguard
he
was
a
pale
youth
with
long
greasy
hair
spectacles
and
more
gold
in
his
teeth
than
he
had
ever
placed
in
his
popriety
forbade
any
actual
conversation
with
sadako
but
there
was
an
interchange
of
letters
almost
every
day
long
subjective
letters
describing
states
of
mind
and
high
ideals
punctuated
with
shadowy
japanese
poems
and
with
quotations
from
the
bible
tolstoy
nietzsche
bergson
eucken
oscar
wilde
and
samuel
smiles
sadako
told
her
cousin
that
the
young
man
was
a
genius
and
would
one
day
be
professor
of
literature
at
the
imperial
university
chapter
xxiii
the
real
shinto
no
naka
wo
nani
ni
tatoyemu
fune
no
ato
no
to
what
shall
i
compare
this
world
to
the
white
wake
behind
a
ship
that
has
rowed
away
at
dawn
when
the
autumn
came
and
the
maple
trees
turned
scarlet
the
men
returned
from
their
long
summer
holidays
after
that
asako
lot
became
heavier
than
ever
what
is
this
talk
of
tall
beds
and
special
cooking
said
fujinami
gentaro
the
girl
is
a
japanese
she
must
live
like
a
japanese
and
be
proud
of
it
so
asako
had
to
sleep
on
the
floor
alongside
her
cousin
sadako
in
one
of
the
downstairs
rooms
her
last
possession
her
privacy
was
taken
away
from
her
the
soft
mattresses
which
formed
the
native
bed
were
not
uncomfortable
but
asako
discarded
at
once
the
wooden
pillow
which
every
japanese
woman
fits
into
the
nape
of
her
neck
so
as
to
prevent
her
elaborate
becoming
disarranged
as
a
result
her
head
was
always
untidy
a
fact
upon
which
her
relatives
commented
she
does
not
look
like
a
great
foreign
lady
now
said
shidzuyé
the
mistress
of
the
house
she
looks
like
a
rough
kitchen
maid
from
a
country
inn
the
other
women
tittered
one
day
the
old
woman
of
akabo
arrived
her
hair
was
quite
white
like
spun
glass
and
her
waxen
face
was
wrinkled
like
a
relief
map
her
body
was
bent
double
like
a
lobster
and
her
eyes
were
dim
with
cataracts
cousin
sadako
said
with
awe
that
she
was
over
a
hundred
years
old
asako
had
to
submit
to
the
indignity
of
allowing
this
dessicated
hag
to
pass
her
fumbling
hands
all
over
her
body
pinching
her
and
prodding
her
the
old
woman
smelt
horribly
of
pickled
furthermore
the
terrified
girl
had
to
answer
a
battery
of
questions
as
to
her
personal
habits
and
her
former
marital
relations
in
return
she
learned
a
number
of
curious
facts
about
herself
of
which
she
had
hitherto
no
inkling
the
lucky
coincidence
of
having
been
born
in
the
hour
of
the
bird
and
the
day
of
the
bird
set
her
apart
from
the
rest
of
womankind
as
an
exceptionally
fortunate
individual
but
unhappily
the
malignant
influence
of
the
dog
year
was
against
her
nativity
when
once
this
disaffected
animal
had
been
conquered
and
cast
out
asako
future
should
be
a
very
bright
one
the
family
witch
agreed
with
the
fujinami
that
the
dog
had
in
all
probability
departed
with
the
foreign
husband
then
the
toothless
crone
breathed
three
times
upon
the
mouth
breasts
and
thighs
of
asako
and
when
this
operation
was
concluded
she
stated
her
opinion
that
there
was
no
reason
obstetrical
or
esoteric
why
the
ransomed
daughter
of
the
house
of
fujinami
should
not
become
the
mother
of
many
children
but
on
the
psychical
condition
of
the
family
in
general
she
was
far
from
reassuring
everything
about
the
mansion
the
growth
of
the
garden
the
flight
of
the
birds
the
noises
of
the
foreboded
dire
disaster
in
the
near
future
the
fujinami
were
in
the
grip
of
a
most
alarming
chain
of
cause
and
effect
several
rough
ghosts
were
abroad
and
were
almost
certain
to
do
damage
before
their
wrath
could
be
appeased
what
was
the
remedy
it
was
indeed
difficult
to
prescribe
for
such
complicated
cases
temple
charms
however
were
always
efficacious
the
old
woman
gave
the
names
of
some
of
the
shrines
which
specialized
in
exorcism
some
days
later
the
charms
were
obtained
strips
of
rice
paper
with
sacred
writings
and
symbols
upon
them
and
were
pasted
upon
posts
and
lintels
all
over
the
house
this
was
done
in
fujinami
absence
when
he
returned
he
commented
most
unfavourably
on
this
act
of
faith
the
prayer
tickets
disfigured
his
house
they
looked
like
luggage
labels
they
injured
his
reputation
as
an
he
ordered
the
students
to
remove
them
after
this
sacrilegious
act
the
old
woman
who
had
lingered
on
in
the
family
mansion
for
several
weeks
returned
again
to
akabo
shaking
her
white
locks
and
prophesying
dark
things
to
come
for
some
reason
or
other
the
witch
visit
did
not
improve
position
she
was
expected
to
perform
little
menial
services
to
bring
in
food
at
and
to
serve
the
gentlemen
on
bended
knee
to
clap
her
hands
in
summons
to
the
servant
girls
to
massage
fujinami
who
suffered
from
rheumatism
in
the
shoulder
and
to
scrub
her
back
in
the
bath
her
wishes
were
usually
ignored
and
she
was
not
encouraged
to
leave
the
house
and
grounds
sadako
no
longer
took
her
cousin
with
her
to
the
theatre
or
to
choose
kimono
patterns
at
the
mitsukoshi
store
she
was
irritated
at
asako
failure
to
learn
japanese
it
bored
her
to
have
to
explain
everything
she
found
this
girl
from
europe
silly
and
undutiful
only
at
night
they
would
chatter
as
girls
will
even
if
they
are
enemies
and
it
was
then
that
sadako
narrated
the
history
of
her
romance
with
the
young
student
one
night
asako
awoke
to
find
that
the
bed
beside
her
was
empty
and
that
the
paper
was
pushed
aside
nervous
and
anxious
she
rose
and
stood
in
the
dark
veranda
outside
the
room
a
cold
wind
was
blowing
in
from
some
aperture
in
the
this
was
unusual
for
a
japanese
house
in
its
night
attire
is
hermetically
sealed
suddenly
sadako
appeared
from
the
direction
of
the
wind
her
hair
was
disheveled
she
wore
a
dark
cloak
over
her
night
kimono
by
the
dim
light
of
the
a
rushlight
in
a
square
paper
box
asako
could
see
that
the
cloak
was
spotted
with
rain
i
have
been
to
said
sadako
nervously
you
have
been
out
in
the
rain
contradicted
her
cousin
you
are
wet
through
you
will
catch
cold
damaré
be
quiet
whispered
sadako
as
she
threw
her
cloak
aside
do
not
talk
so
loud
see
she
drew
from
her
breast
a
short
sword
in
a
sheath
of
shagreen
if
you
speak
one
word
i
kill
you
with
this
what
have
you
done
asked
asako
trembling
what
i
wished
to
do
was
the
sullen
answer
you
have
been
with
sekiné
asako
mentioned
the
student
name
sadako
nodded
in
assent
then
she
began
to
cry
hiding
her
face
in
her
kimono
sleeve
do
you
love
him
asako
could
not
help
asking
of
course
i
love
him
cried
sadako
starting
up
from
her
sorrow
you
see
me
i
am
no
more
virgin
he
is
my
life
to
me
why
can
not
i
love
him
why
can
not
i
be
free
like
men
are
free
to
love
as
they
wish
i
am
new
woman
i
read
bernard
shaw
i
find
one
law
for
men
in
japan
and
another
law
for
women
but
i
will
break
that
law
i
have
made
sekiné
my
lover
because
i
am
free
asako
could
never
have
imagined
her
proud
inhuman
cousin
reduced
to
this
state
of
quivering
emotion
never
before
had
she
seen
a
japanese
soul
laid
bare
but
you
will
marry
sekiné
sada
dear
and
then
you
will
be
happy
marry
sekiné
the
girl
hissed
marry
a
boy
with
no
money
and
leave
you
to
be
the
fujinami
heiress
when
i
am
promised
to
the
governor
of
osaka
who
will
be
home
minister
when
the
next
governor
comes
oh
do
do
that
urged
asako
her
english
sentimentalism
flooding
back
across
her
mind
do
marry
a
man
whom
you
do
love
you
say
you
are
a
new
woman
marry
sekiné
marry
the
man
whom
you
love
then
you
will
be
happy
japanese
girls
are
never
happy
groaned
her
cousin
asako
gasped
this
morality
confused
her
but
that
would
be
a
mortal
sin
she
said
then
you
could
never
be
happy
we
can
not
be
happy
we
are
fujinami
said
sadako
gravely
we
are
cursed
the
old
woman
of
akabo
said
that
it
is
a
very
bad
curse
i
do
not
believe
superstition
but
i
believe
there
is
a
curse
you
also
you
have
been
unhappy
and
your
father
and
mother
we
are
cursed
because
of
the
women
we
have
made
so
much
money
from
poor
women
they
are
sold
to
men
and
they
suffer
in
pain
and
die
so
that
we
become
rich
it
is
a
very
bad
so
they
say
in
akabo
that
we
fujinami
have
a
fox
in
our
family
it
brings
us
money
but
it
makes
us
unhappy
in
akabo
even
poor
people
will
not
marry
with
the
fujinami
because
we
have
the
fox
it
is
a
popular
belief
still
widely
held
in
japan
that
certain
families
own
spirit
foxes
a
kind
of
family
banshee
who
render
them
service
but
mark
them
with
a
curse
i
do
not
understand
said
asako
afraid
of
this
wild
talk
do
you
know
why
the
englishman
went
away
said
her
cousin
brutally
it
was
asako
turn
to
cry
oh
i
wish
i
had
gone
with
him
he
was
so
good
to
me
always
so
kind
and
so
gentle
when
he
married
you
said
sadako
he
did
not
know
that
you
had
the
curse
he
ought
not
to
have
come
to
japan
with
you
now
he
knows
you
have
the
curse
so
he
went
away
he
was
wise
what
do
you
mean
by
the
curse
asked
asako
you
do
not
know
how
the
fujinami
have
made
so
much
money
no
said
asako
it
used
to
come
for
me
from
ito
he
had
shares
or
something
yes
but
a
share
that
means
a
share
of
a
business
do
you
not
know
what
is
our
business
no
said
asako
again
you
have
seen
the
yoshiwara
where
girls
are
sold
to
men
that
is
our
business
do
you
understand
now
no
then
i
will
tell
you
the
whole
story
of
the
fujinami
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
years
ago
our
came
to
yedo
as
tokyo
was
then
called
he
was
a
poor
boy
from
the
country
he
had
no
friends
he
became
clerk
in
a
dry
goods
store
one
day
a
woman
rather
old
asked
him
much
pay
you
get
he
said
pay
only
food
and
clothes
the
woman
said
with
me
i
will
give
you
food
and
clothes
and
pay
also
he
went
with
her
to
the
yoshiwara
where
she
had
a
small
house
with
five
or
six
girls
every
night
he
must
stand
in
front
of
the
house
calling
then
the
drunken
workmen
and
the
gamblers
and
the
bad
would
come
and
pay
their
money
and
they
pay
their
money
to
him
our
when
the
girls
were
sick
or
would
not
receive
guests
he
would
beat
them
and
starve
them
and
burn
a
medical
plant
called
moxa
used
for
cauterization
on
their
backs
one
day
he
said
to
the
woman
who
was
mistress
of
the
house
girls
are
too
old
the
rich
friends
do
not
come
any
more
let
us
sell
these
girls
i
will
go
into
the
country
and
get
new
girls
and
then
you
will
marry
me
and

your
partner
the
woman
said

have
good
luck
with
the
girls
and
make
money
then
i
marry
you
so
our
went
back
to
his
own
country
to
akabo
and
his
old
friends
in
the
country
were
astonished
seeing
how
much
money
he
had
to
spend
he
said
i
have
many
rich
friends
in
yedo
they
want
pretty
country
girls
to
be
their
wives

in
advance

pieces
of
gold
after
the
marriage
more
money
will
be
given
let
me
take
your
prettiest
girls
to
yedo
with
me
and
they
will
all
get
rich
husbands
they
were
simple
country
people
and
they
believed
him
because
he
was
a
man
of
their
village
of
akabo
he
went
back
to
yedo
with
about
twenty
girls
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
old
he
and
the
other
clerks
of
the
yoshiwara
first
made
them
from
those
twenty
girls
he
made
very
much
money
so
he
married
the
woman
who
kept
the
house
then
he
hired
a
big
house
called
tomonji
he
furnished
it
very
richly
and
he
would
only
receive
guests
of
the
people
five
of
his
girls
became
very
famous
even
their
pictures
drawn
by
utamaro
are
worth
now
hundreds
of
when
our
died
he
was
a
very
rich
man
his
son
was
the
second
fujinami
he
bought
more
houses
in
the
yoshiwara
and
more
girls
he
was
our
he
had
two
sons
one
was
your
father
father
who
bought
this
land
and
first
built
a
house
here
the
other
was
my
grandfather
fujinami
gennosuké
who
still
lives
in
the
they
have
all
made
much
money
from
girls
but
the
curse
was
hurting
them
all
especially
their
wives
and
daughters
and
my
father
asked
asako
your
father
wrote
a
book
to
say
how
bad
a
thing
it
is
that
money
is
made
from
men
lust
and
the
pain
of
women
he
told
in
the
book
how
girls
are
tricked
to
come
to
tokyo
how
their
parents
sell
them
because
they
are
poor
or
because
there
is
famine
how
the
girls
are
brought
to
tokyo
ten
and
twenty
at
a
time
and
are
put
to
auction
sale
in
the
yoshiwara
how
they
are
shut
up
like
prisoner
how
very
rough
men
are
sent
to
them
to
break
their
spirit
and
to
compel
them
to
be
there
is
a
trial
to
see
how
strong
they
are
then
when
the
spirit
is
broken
they
are
shown
in
the
window
as
girls
with
beautiful
kimono
and
with
wreath
of
flowers
on
their
head
if
they
are
lucky
they
escape
disease
for
a
few
years
but
it
comes
soon
or
late
and
they
are
sent
to
the
hospital
for
treatment
or
else
they
are
told
to
hide
the
disease
and
to
get
more
men
so
the
men
take
the
disease
and
bring
it
to
their
wives
and
children
who
have
done
no
wrong
but
the
girls
of
the
yoshiwara
have
to
work
all
the
time
when
they
are
only
half
cured
so
they
become
old
and
ugly
and
rotten
very
quickly
then
if
they
take
consumption
or
some
such
thing
they
die
and
the
master
says
is
well
she
was
already
too
old
she
was
wasting
our
money
and
they
are
buried
quickly
in
the
burial
place
of
the
outside
the
city
boundary
the
burial
place
of
the
dead
who
are
forgotten
or
some
who
are
very
strong
live
until
their
contract
is
finished
then
they
go
back
to
the
country
and
marry
there
and
spread
disease
but
they
all
die
cursing
the
fujinami
who
have
made
money
out
of
their
sorrow
and
pain
i
think
this
garden
is
full
of
their
ghosts
and
their
curses
beat
upon
the
house
like
the
wind
when
it
makes
the
shutters
rattle
how
do
you
know
all
these
terrible
things
asked
asako
it
is
written
in
your
father
book
i
will
read
it
to
you
if
you
do
not
believe
ask
ito
san
he
will
tell
you
it
is
true
so
for
several
evenings
sadako
read
to
this
stranger
fujinami
her
own
father
words
the
words
of
a
forerunner
japan
is
still
a
savage
country
wrote
fujinami
katsundo
the
japanese
are
still
barbarians
to
compare
the
conventional
codes
which
they
have
mistaken
for
civilization
with
the
depth
and
the
height
of
occidental
idealism
as
christ
perceived
it
and
dante
and
francis
of
assisi
and
tolstoy
is
to
compare
the
tortoise
with
the
moon
japan
is
imitating
from
the
west
its
worst
propensities
hard
materialism
vulgarity
and
the
japanese
must
be
humble
and
must
admit
that
the
most
difficult
part
of
their
lesson
has
yet
to
be
learned
cut
and
dried
systems
are
useless
prussian
constitution
technical
education
military
efficiency
and
bravado
such
things
are
not
progress
japan
must
denounce
the
slavery
of
and
escape
from
the
rule
of
the
dead
she
must
chase
away
the
bogeys
of
superstition
and
enjoy
life
as
a
lovely
thing
and
love
as
the
vision
of
a
life
still
more
beautiful
she
must
cleanse
her
land
of
all
its
filth
and
make
it
what
it
still
might
be
the
country
of
the
rising
sun
such
was
the
message
of
asako
father
in
his
book
real
we
are
not
allowed
to
read
this
book
sadako
explained
the
police
have
forbidden
it
but
i
found
a
secret
copy
it
was
undutiful
of
your
father
to
write
such
things
he
went
away
from
japan
and
everyone
said
is
a
good
thing
he
has
gone
he
was
a
bad
man
he
shamed
his
country
and
his
family
there
was
much
in
the
book
which
asako
could
not
follow
her
cousin
tried
to
explain
it
to
her
and
many
nights
passed
thus
the
two
girls
sitting
up
and
reading
by
the
pale
light
of
the
it
was
like
a
renewal
of
the
old
friendship
sometimes
a
low
whistle
sounded
from
outside
the
house
sadako
would
lay
aside
the
book
would
slip
on
her
cloak
and
go
out
into
the
garden
where
sekiné
was
waiting
for
her
when
she
was
left
to
herself
asako
began
to
think
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
hitherto
her
thoughts
had
been
concerned
merely
with
her
own
pleasures
and
pains
with
the
smiles
and
frowns
of
those
around
her
with
petty
events
and
trifling
projects
perhaps
because
some
of
her
father
blood
was
alive
in
her
veins
she
could
understand
certain
aspects
of
his
book
more
clearly
than
her
interpreter
sadako
she
knew
now
why
geoffrey
would
not
touch
her
money
it
was
filthy
it
was
diseased
like
the
poor
women
who
had
earned
it
of
course
her
geoffrey
preferred
poverty
to
wealth
like
that
could
she
face
poverty
with
him
why
she
was
poor
already
here
in
her
cousins
house
where
was
the
luxury
which
her
money
used
to
buy
she
was
living
the
life
of
a
servant
and
a
prisoner
what
would
be
the
end
of
it
surely
geoffrey
would
come
back
to
her
and
take
her
away
but
he
had
no
money
now
and
it
would
cost
much
money
to
travel
to
japan
and
then
this
terrible
war
geoffrey
was
a
soldier
he
would
be
sure
to
be
there
leading
his
men
supposing
he
were
killed
one
night
in
a
dream
she
saw
his
body
carried
past
her
limp
and
bleeding
she
screamed
in
her
sleep
sadako
awoke
terrified
what
is
the
matter
i
dreamed
of
geoffrey
my
husband
perhaps
he
is
killed
in
the
war
do
not
say
that
said
sadako
it
is
unlucky
to
speak
of
death
it
troubles
the
ghosts
i
have
told
you
this
house
is
haunted
certainly
for
asako
the
fujinami
mansion
had
lost
its
charm
even
the
beautiful
landscape
was
besieged
by
horrible
thoughts
every
day
two
or
three
of
the
yoshiwara
women
died
of
disease
and
neglect
so
sadako
said
and
therefore
every
day
the
invisible
population
of
the
fujinami
garden
must
be
increasing
and
the
volume
of
their
curses
must
be
gathering
in
intensity
the
ghosts
hissed
like
snakes
in
the
bamboo
grove
they
sighed
in
the
pine
branches
they
nourished
the
dwarf
shrubs
with
their
pollution
beneath
the
waters
of
the
lake
the
corpses
women
corpses
were
laid
out
in
rows
their
thin
hands
shook
the
reeds
their
pale
faces
rose
at
night
to
the
surface
and
stared
at
the
moon
the
autumn
maples
smeared
the
scene
with
infected
blood
and
the
stone
foxes
in
front
of
the
shrine
of
inari
sneered
and
grinned
at
the
devil
world
which
their
foul
influence
had
called
into
being
through
the
black
witchcraft
of
lechery
avarice
and
disease

during

the
whole

of

removed
from

for
a

days
in

to
perform
their

only
fujinami
takeshi
the
son
and
heir
with
his

matsuko
was
absent
there
had
been
some
further
trouble
in
the
family
which
had
not
been
confided
to
asako
but
which
necessitated
urgent
steps
for
the
propitiation
of
religious
influences
the
fujinami
were
followers
of
the
nichiren
sect
of
buddhism
their
conspicuous
devotion
and
their
large
gifts
to
the
priests
of
the
temple
were
held
to
be
causes
of
their
prosperity
the
dead
fujinami
down
from
that
who
had
first
come
to
seek
his
fortune
in
yedo
were
buried
at
ikégami
here
the
priests
gave
to
each
buddha
or
dead
person
his
new
name
which
was
inscribed
on
small
black
tablets
the
one
of
these
tablets
for
each
dead
person
was
kept
in
the
household
shrine
at
tokyo
and
one
in
the
temple
at
ikégami
asako
was
taken
to
the
october
festival
because
her
father
too
was
buried
in
the
temple
grounds
one
small
bone
of
him
that
is
to
say
an
or
legacy
bone
posted
home
from
paris
before
the
rest
of
his
mortality
found
alien
sepulture
at
père
lachaise
masses
were
said
for
the
dead
and
asako
was
introduced
to
the
tablet
but
she
did
not
feel
the
same
emotion
as
when
she
first
visited
the
fujinami
house
now
she
had
heard
her
father
authentic
voice
she
knew
his
scorn
for
pretentiousness
of
all
kinds
for
false
conventions
for
false
emotions
his
hatred
of
priestcraft
his
condemnation
of
the
family
wealth
and
his
contempt
for
the
little
respectabilities
of
japanese
life
a
temple
in
japan
is
not
merely
a
building
it
is
a
site
these
sites
were
most
carefully
chosen
with
the
same
genius
which
guided
our
benedictines
and
carthusians
the
site
of
ikégami
is
a
hill
between
tokyo
and
yokohama
it
is
clothed
with
trees
these
dark
conifers
like
immense
cypresses
give
to
the
spot
that
grave
silent
irrevocable
atmosphere
with
which
boecklin
has
invested
his
picture
of
the
island
of
the
dead
these
majestic
trees
are
essentially
a
part
of
the
temple
they
correspond
to
the
pillars
of
our
gothic
cathedrals
the
roof
is
the
blue
vault
of
heaven
and
the
actual
buildings
are
but
altars
chantries
and
monuments
a
steep
flight
of
steps
is
suspended
like
a
cascade
from
the
crest
of
the
hill
up
and
down
these
steps
the
wooden
clogs
of
the
japanese
people
patter
incessantly
like
at
the
top
of
the
steps
stands
the
towered
gateway
painted
with
red
ochre
which
leads
to
the
precincts
the
guardians
of
the
gate
the
two
gigantic
deva
kings
who
have
passed
from
india
into
japanese
mythology
are
encaged
in
the
gateway
building
their
cage
and
their
persons
are
littered
with
nasty
morsels
of
chewed
paper
wherever
their
worshippers
have
literally
spat
their
prayers
at
them
within
the
enclosure
are
the
various
temple
buildings
the
the
library
the
the
hall
of
votive
offerings
the
sacred
the
stone
lanterns
and
the
lodgings
for
the
pilgrims
also
the
two
main
halls
for
the
temple
services
which
are
raised
on
low
piles
and
are
linked
together
by
a
covered
bridge
so
that
they
look
like
twin
arks
of
safety
floating
just
five
feet
above
the
troubles
of
this
life
these
buildings
are
most
of
them
painted
red
and
there
is
fine
carving
on
panels
friezes
and
pediments
and
also
much
tawdry
gaudiness
behind
these
two
sanctuaries
is
the
mortuary
chapel
where
repose
the
memories
of
many
of
the
greatest
in
the
land
behind
this
again
are
the
priests
dormitories
with
a
lovely
hidden
garden
hanging
on
the
slopes
of
a
sudden
ravine
its
presiding
genius
is
an
old
beneath
which
nichiren
himself
a
contemporary
and
a
counterpart
of
saint
dominic
used
to
meditate
on
his
project
for
a
universal
church
founded
on
the
life
of
buddha
and
led
by
the
apostolate
of
japan
for
the
inside
of
a
week
the
fujinami
dwelt
in
one
of
a
row
of
stalls
like
within
the
temple
precincts
the
festival
might
have
some
affinity
with
the
jewish
feast
of
tabernacles
when
the
devout
left
their
city
dwellings
to
live
in
booths
outside
the
walls
my
h
renge
ky
adoration
to
the
wonderful
law
of
the
lotus
scriptures
the
famous
formula
of
the
priests
of
the
nichiren
sect
was
being
repeated
over
and
over
again
to
the
accompaniment
of
drums
for
in
the
sacred
text
itself
lies
the
only
authentic
way
of
salvation
with
exemplary
insistence
fujinami
gennosuké
was
beating
out
the
rhythm
of
the
prayer
with
a
wooden
clapper
on
the
a
wooden
drum
shaped
like
a
fish
head
my
h
renge
ky
from
every
corner
of
the
temple
the
invocation
was
droning
like
a
threshing
machine
asako
catholic
conscience
now
awakening
from
the
spell
which
japan
had
cast
upon
it
became
uneasy
about
its
share
in
these
pagan
rites
in
order
to
drive
the
echo
of
the
litany
out
of
her
ears
she
tried
to
concentrate
her
attention
upon
watching
the
crowd
my
h
renge
ky
around
her
was
a
dense
multitude
of
pilgrims
in
their
hundreds
of
thousands
shuffling
chaffering
and
staring
some
like
the
fujinami
had
hired
temporary
lodgings
and
had
cooks
and
servants
in
attendance
some
were
camping
in
the
open
others
were
merely
visiting
the
temple
for
the
inside
of
the
day
the
crowds
kept
on
shifting
and
mingling
like
ants
on
an
enjoyment
rather
than
piety
was
the
prevailing
spirit
for
this
was
one
of
the
few
annual
holidays
of
the
industrious
tokyo
artisan
in
the
central
buildings
five
feet
above
this
noisy
confluence
of
people
where
the
golden
images
of
the
buddhas
are
enthroned
the
mitred
priests
with
their
copes
of
brown
were
performing
the
rituals
of
their
order
to
right
and
left
of
the
high
altar
the
canons
squatting
at
their
were
reciting
the
in
strophe
and
antistrophe
clouds
of
incense
rose
in
the
adjoining
building
an
earnest
young
preacher
was
exhorting
a
congregation
of
elderly
and
somnolent
ladies
to
eschew
the
lusts
of
the
flesh
and
to
renounce
the
world
and
its
gauds
marking
each
point
in
his
discourse
with
raps
of
his
fan
satellites
of
the
abbey
were
doing
a
roaring
trade
in
charms
against
various
accidents
and
in
sacred
scrolls
printed
with
prayers
or
figures
of
nichiren
the

an
immense

fair
the

pigeons
wheeled
disconsolately
in

perched
upon

roofs
unable
to

one
square

flagstones
where
they
were
used
to
strut
and
peck

lined
the
stone
pathways
and
choked

the
actors
making
up
in
public
on
a
balcony
above
the
crowd
so
as
to
whet
their
curiosity
and
attract
their
custom
beyond
was
a
cinematograph
advertised
by
lurid
paintings
of
murders
and
apparitions
and
farther
on
there
was
a
circus
with
a
mangy
zoo
the
crowd
was
astonishingly
mixed
there
were
prosperous
merchants
of
tokyo
with
their
wives
children
servants
and
apprentices
there
were
students
with
their
blue
and
white
spotted
cloaks
their
with
the
school
badge
and
their
ungainly
stride
there
were
modern
young
men
in
european
dress
with
panama
hats
swagger
canes
and
shoes
supercilious
in
attitude
and
proud
of
their
unbelief
there
were
troops
of
variegated
children
dragging
at
their
elders
hands
or
kimonos
or
getting
lost
among
the
legs
of
the
multitude
like
little
leaves
in
an
eddy
there
were
excursion
parties
from
the
country
with
their
kimonos
caught
up
to
the
knees
and
with
baked
earthen
faces
stupidly
staring
sporting
each
a
red
flower
or
a
coloured
towel
for
identification
purposes
there
were
labourers
in
tight
trousers
and
tabard
jackets
inscribed
with
the
name
and
profession
of
their
employer
there
were
girls
on
their
best
behaviour
in
charge
of
a
professional
auntie
and
recognizable
only
by
the
smart
cut
of
their
cloaks
and
the
deep
space
between
the
collar
and
the
nape
of
the
neck
where
the
black
lay
close
to
the
tomb
of
nichiren
stood
a
japanese
salvationist
a
zealous
pimply
young
man
wearing
the
red
and
blue
uniform
of
general
booth
with
army
in
japanese
letters
round
his
staff
cap
he
stood
in
front
of
a
screen
on
which
the
first
verse
of
onward
christian
soldiers
was
written
in
a
japanese
translation
an
assistant
officiated
at
a
wheezy
harmonium
the
tune
was
vaguely
akin
to
its
western
prototype
and
the
two
evangelists
were
trying
to
induce
a
tolerant
but
uninterested
crowd
to
join
in
the
chorus
everywhere
beggars
were
crawling
over
the
compound
in
various
states
of
filth
some
however
were
so
ghastly
that
they
were
excluded
from
the
temple
enclosure
they
had
lined
up
among
the
trunks
of
the
cryptomeria
trees
among
the
little
grey
tombs
with
their
fading
inscriptions
and
the
statues
of
kindly
buddhas
asako
gave
a
penny
into
the
crooked
hand
of
one
poor
sightless
wretch
oh
no
cried
cousin
sadako
do
not
go
near
to
them
do
not
touch
them
they
are
lepers
some
of
them
had
no
arms
or
had
mere
stumps
ending
abruptly
in
a
red
and
sickening
object
like
a
bone
which
a
dog
has
been
chewing
some
had
no
legs
and
were
pulled
along
on
little
wheeled
trolleys
by
their
less
dilapidated
companions
in
misfortune
some
had
no
features
their
faces
were
mere
glabrous
disks
from
which
eyes
and
nose
had
completely
vanished
only
the
mouth
remained
a
toothless
gap
fringed
with
straggling
hairs
some
had
faces
abnormally
bloated
with
powerful
foreheads
and
heavy
jowls
which
gave
them
an
expression
of
stony
immobility
like
byzantine
lions
all
were
fearfully
dirty
and
covered
with
sores
and
lice
the
people
passing
by
smiled
at
their
grim
unsightliness
and
threw
pennies
to
them
for
which
they
scrambled
and
scratched
like
beasts
my
h
renge
ky
asako
relatives
spent
the
day
in
eating
drinking
and
gossiping
to
the
rhythm
of
the
interminable
prayer
it
was
a
perfect
day
of
autumn
which
is
the
sweetest
season
in
japan
a
warm
bright
sun
had
been
shining
on
the
sumptuous
colours
of
the
waning
year
on
the
brilliant
reds
and
yellows
which
clothed
the
neighbouring
hills
on
the
broad
brown
plain
with
its
tesselated
design
of
bare
on
the
brown
villas
and
cottages
huddled
in
their
fences
of
evergreen
like
birds
in
their
nests
on
the
red
trunks
of
the
cryptomeria
trees
on
the
brown
carpet
of
matted
on
the
grey
crumbling
stones
of
the
old
graveyard
on
the
temple
roofs
and
on
the
inconsequential
swarms
of
humanity
drifting
to
their
devotions
casting
their
pennies
into
the
great
in
front
of
the
shrine
clanging
the
brass
bell
with
a
prayer
for
good
luck
and
drifting
home
again
with
their
bewildered
happy
children
asako
no
longer
felt
like
a
japanese
the
sight
of
her
countrymen
in
their
drab
monotonous
thousands
sickened
her
the
hiss
and
cackle
of
their
incomprehensible
tongue
beat
upon
her
brain
with
a
deadly
incessant
sound
like
raindrops
to
one
who
is
impatiently
awaiting
the
return
of
fine
weather
here
at
ikégami
the
distant
view
of
the
sea
and
the
yokohama
shipping
invited
asako
to
escape
but
where
could
she
escape
to
to
england
she
was
an
englishwoman
no
longer
she
had
cast
her
husband
off
for
insufficient
reasons
she
had
been
cold
loveless
and
silly
she
had
acted
as
she
now
recognised
largely
on
the
suggestion
of
others
like
a
fool
she
had
believed
what
had
been
told
she
had
not
trusted
her
love
for
her
husband
as
usual
her
thoughts
returned
to
geoffrey
and
to
the
constant
danger
which
threatened
him
lately
she
had
started
to
write
a
letter
to
him
several
times
but
had
never
got
further
than
dearest
geoffrey
she
was
glad
when
the
irritating
day
was
over
when
the
rosy
sunset
clouds
showed
through
the
trunks
of
the
cryptomerias
when
the
night
fell
and
the
great
stars
like
lamps
hung
in
the
branches
but
the
night
brought
no
silence
paper
lanterns
were
lighted
round
the
temple
and
rough
acetylene
flares
lit
up
the
tawdry
fairings
the
chattering
the
bargaining
the
clatter
of
the
became
more
terrifying
even
than
in
daytime
it
was
like
being
in
the
darkness
in
a
cage
of
wild
beasts
heard
felt
but
unseen
the
evening
breeze
was
cold
in
spite
of
the
big
wooden
fireboxes
strewn
over
their
stall
the
fujinami
were
shivering
let
us
go
for
a
walk
suggested
cousin
sadako
the
two
girls
strolled
along
the
ridge
of
the
hill
as
far
as
the
pagoda
they
passed
the
so
famous
for
its
in
early
march
it
was
brightly
lighted
the
paper
rectangles
of
the
were
aglow
like
an
illuminated
honeycomb
the
wooden
walls
resounded
with
the
jangle
of
the
the
high
screaming
voices
and
the
rough
laughter
of
the
guests
from
one
room
the
were
pushed
open
and
drunken
men
could
be
seen
with
kimonos
thrown
back
from
their
shoulders
showing
a
body
reddened
with
they
had
taken
the
instruments
from
them
and
were
performing
an
impromptu
song
and
dance
while
the
girls
clapped
their
hands
and
writhed
with
laughter
beyond
the
the
din
of
the
festival
was
hushed
only
from
the
distance
came
the
echo
of
the
song
the
rasp
of
the
forced
merriment
the
clatter
of
the
and
the
hum
of
the
crowd
starlight
revealed
the
landscape
the
moon
was
rising
through
a
cloud
liquescence
soon
the
hundreds
of
would
catch
her
full
reflection
the
outline
of
the
coast
of
tokyo
bay
was
visible
as
far
as
yokohama
so
were
the
broad
pool
of
ikégami
and
the
lumpy
masses
of
the
hills
inland
the
landscape
was
alive
with
lights
lights
dim
lights
bright
lights
stationary
lights
in
swaying
movement
round
each
centre
of
population
it
looked
as
if
the
stars
had
fallen
from
heaven
and
were
being
shifted
and
sorted
by
careful
gleaners
as
each
nebula
of
white
illumination
assembled
itself
it
began
to
move
across
the
vast
plain
drawn
inwards
towards
ikégami
from
every
point
of
the
compass
as
though
by
a
magnetic
force
these
were
the
lantern
processions
of
pilgrims
they
looked
like
the
souls
of
the
righteous
rising
from
earth
to
heaven
in
a
canto
from
dante
the
clusters
of
lights
started
moved
onwards
paused
themselves
and
struggled
forward
until
in
the
narrow
street
of
the
village
under
the
hill
asako
could
distinguish
the
shapes
of
the
and
their
strange
antics
and
the
sacred
palanquin
a
kind
of
enormous
wooden
which
was
the
centre
of
each
procession
borne
on
the
sturdy
shoulders
of
a
swarm
of
young
men
to
the
beat
of
drums
and
the
inevitable
chant
my
h
renge
ky
slowly
the
procession
jolted
up
the
steep
stairway
and
came
to
rest
with
their
heavy
burdens
in
front
of
the
temple
of
nichiren
it
is
very
silly
said
cousin
sadako
to
be
so
superstitious
i
think
then
why
are
we
here
asked
asako
my
grandfather
is
very
superstitious
and
my
father
is
afraid
to
say
to
him
my
father
does
not
believe
in
any
gods
or
buddhas
but
he
says
it
does
no
harm
and
it
may
do
good
all
our
family
is
brandishers
of
sacred
symbols
we
think
that
with
all
this
prayer
we
can
turn
away
the
trouble
of
takeshi
why
what
is
the
matter
with
takeshi
why
is
he
not
here
and
matsuko
san
and
the
children
it
is
a
great
secret
said
the
fujinami
cousin
you
will
tell
no
one
you
will
pretend
also
even
with
me
that
you
do
not
know
takeshi
san
is
very
sick
the
doctor
says
that
he
is
a
leper
asako
stared
uncomprehending
sadako
went
on
you
saw
this
morning
those
ugly
beggars
they
were
all
so
terrible
to
see
and
their
bodies
were
so
rotten
my
brother
is
becoming
like
that
it
is
a
sickness
it
can
not
be
cured
it
will
kill
him
very
slowly
perhaps
his
wife
matsu
and
his
children
also
have
the
sickness
perhaps
we
too
are
sick
no
one
can
tell
not
for
many
years
ugly
wings
seemed
to
cover
the
night
the
world
beneath
the
hill
had
become
the
pit
of
hell
and
the
points
of
light
were
devils
spears
asako
trembled
what
does
it
mean
she
asked
how
did
takeshi
san
become
sick
it
was
a
judgment
of
heaven
answered
her
cousin
takeshi
san
was
a
bad
man
he
was
rude
to
his
father
and
he
was
cruel
to
his
wife
he
thought
only
of
and
bad
women
no
doubt
he
became
sick
from
touching
a
woman
who
was
sick
besides
it
is
the
bad
of
the
fujinami
family
did
not
the
old
woman
of
akabo
say
so
it
is
the
curse
of
the
yoshiwara
women
it
will
be
our
turn
next
yours
and
mine
no
wonder
that
poor
asako
could
not
sleep
that
night
in
the
cramped
promiscuity
of
the
family
dead
fujinami
takeshi
had
been
sickly
for
some
time
but
then
his
course
of
life
could
hardly
be
called
a
healthy
one
on
his
return
from
his
summer
holiday
red
patches
had
appeared
on
the
palms
of
his
hands
and
afterwards
on
his
forehead
he
had
complained
of
the
irritation
caused
by
this
rash
professor
kashio
had
been
called
in
to
prescribe
a
blood
test
was
taken
the
doctor
then
pronounced
that
the
son
and
heir
was
suffering
from
leprosy
and
for
that
there
was
no
cure
the
disease
is
accompanied
by
irritation
but
by
little
actual
pain
constant
application
of
compresses
can
allay
the
itching
and
can
often
save
the
patient
from
the
more
ghastly
ravages
of
disfigurement
but
slowly
the
limbs
lose
their
force
the
fingers
and
toes
drop
away
the
hair
falls
and
merciful
blindness
comes
to
hide
from
the
sufferer
the
living
corpse
to
which
his
spirit
is
bound
more
merciful
yet
the
slow
decay
attacks
the
organs
of
the
body
often
consumption
intervenes
often
just
a
simple
cold
suffices
to
snuff
out
the
flickering
life
in
the
village
of
kusatsu
beyond
the
karuizawa
mountains
there
is
a
natural
hot
spring
whose
waters
are
beneficial
for
the
alleviation
of
the
disease
in
this
place
there
is
a
settlement
of
lepers
thither
it
was
decided
to
banish
poor
takeshi
his
wife
matsuko
naturally
was
expected
to
accompany
him
to
nurse
him
and
to
make
life
as
comfortable
for
him
as
she
could
her
eventual
doom
was
almost
certain
but
there
was
no
question
no
choice
no
hesitation
and
no
praise
every
japanese
wife
is
obliged
to
become
an
alcestis
if
her
husband
demand
it
the
children
were
sent
to
the
ancestral
village

with
a
rocking
as
of
great
ships
riding
at

i
have
at
last
become
worn
out
with
love
because
of
a
child
of
a
man
when
the
fujinami
returned
to
tokyo
the
wing
of
the
house
in
which
the
unfortunate
son
had
lived
had
been
demolished
an
ugly
scar
remained
a
slab
of
charred
concrete
strewn
with
ashes
and
burned
beams
saddest
sight
of
all
was
the
twisted
iron
work
of
foreign
bedstead
once
the
symbol
of
progress
and
of
the
spirit
the
fire
was
supposed
to
have
been
accidental
but
the
ravages
had
been
carefully
limited
to
the
offending
wing
fujinami
gentaro
disgusted
at
this
unsightly
wreckage
wished
to
rebuild
at
once
but
the
old
grandfather
had
objected
that
this
spot
of
misfortune
was
situated
in
the
northeast
corner
of
the
mansion
a
quarter
notoriously
exposed
to
the
attacks
of
evil
spirits
he
was
in
favor
of
total
demolishment
this
was
only
one
of
the
differences
of
opinion
between
the
two
seniors
of
the
house
of
fujinami
which
became
more
frequent
as
the
clouds
of
disaster
gathered
over
the
home
in
akasaka
a
far
more
thorny
problem
was
the
question
of
the
succession
with
the
living
death
of
takeshi
there
was
no
male
heir
several
family
councils
were
held
in
the
presence
of
the
two
fujinami
generally
in
the
at
which
six
or
seven
members
of
the
collateral
branches
were
also
present
grandfather
gennosuké
who
despised
takeshi
as
a
waster
would
not
listen
to
any
plea
on
behalf
of
his
children
to
a
bad
father
a
bad
child
he
enunciated
his
restless
jaw
masticating
more
ferociously
than
ever
he
was
strongly
of
opinion
that
it
was
the
curse
of
asako
father
which
had
brought
this
sorrow
upon
his
family
katsundo
and
asako
were
representatives
of
the
elder
branch
himself
gentaro
and
takeshi
were
mere
usurpers
restore
the
elder
branch
to
its
rights
and
the
indignant
ghost
would
cease
to
plague
them
all
such
was
the
argument
of
grandfather
gennosuké
fujinami
gentaro
naturally
supported
the
claims
of
his
own
progeny
if
takeshi
children
must
be
disinherited
because
of
the
leprous
strain
then
at
least
sadako
remained
she
was
a
and
serious
girl
she
knew
foreign
languages
she
could
make
a
brilliant
marriage
her
husband
would
be
adopted
as
heir
perhaps
the
governor
of
osaka
the
other
members
of
the
council
shook
their
heads
and
breathed
deeply
were
there
no
fujinami
left
of
the
collateral
branches
why
adopt
a
outside
person
so
spoke
the
the
man
with
a
wen
who
had
an
axe
of
his
own
to
grind
it
was
decided
to
choose
the
candidate
first
of
all
and
afterwards
to
decide
which
of
the
girls
he
was
to
marry
perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
to
consult
the
fortune
tellers
at
any
rate
a
list
of
suitable
applicants
would
be
prepared
for
the
next
meeting
when
men
speak
of
the
future
said
grandfather
gennosuké
the
rats
in
the
ceiling
laugh
so
the
conference
broke
up
fujinami
gentaro
had
no
sooner
returned
to
the
academic
calm
of
his
chaste
reading
room
than
ito
appeared
on
the
threshold
the
oily
face
was
more
moist
than
usual
the
moustache
more
truculent
and
though
the
autumn
day
was
cool
ito
was
agitating
a
fan
he
was
evidently
nervous
before
approaching
the
sanctum
he
had
blown
his
nose
into
a
small
square
piece
of
soft
paper
which
is
the
japanese
apology
for
a
handkerchief
he
had
looked
around
for
some
place
where
to
cast
the
offence
but
finding
none
along
the
trim
garden
border
he
had
slipped
it
into
his
wide
kimono
sleeve
fujinami
frowned
he
was
tired
of
business
matters
and
the
worry
of
other
people
affairs
he
longed
for
peace
indeed
the
weather
becomes
perceptibly
cooler
said
ito
with
a
low
prostration
if
there
is
business
his
patron
replied
crisply
please
step
up
into
the
room
ito
slipped
off
his
and
ascended
from
the
garden
path
when
he
had
settled
himself
in
the
correct
attitude
with
legs
crossed
and
folded
fujinami
pushed
over
towards
him
a
packet
of
cigarettes
adding
please
without
embarrassment
speak
quickly
what
you
have
to
say
ito
chose
a
cigarette
and
slowly
pinched
together
the
cardboard
holder
which
formed
its
lower
half
indeed
it
is
a
difficult
matter
he
began
it
is
a
matter
which
should
be
handled
by
an
intermediary
if
i
speak
face
to
face
like
a
foreigner
the
master
will
excuse
my
rudeness
please
speak
clearly
i
owe
my
advancement
in
life
entirely
to
the
master
i
was
the
son
of
poor
parents
i
was
an
emigrant
and
a
vagabond
over
three
thousand
worlds
the
master
gave
me
a
home
and
lucrative
employment
i
have
served
the
master
for
many
years
with
my
poor
effort
the
fortunes
of
the
family
have
perhaps
increased
i
have
become
as
it
were
a
to
the
fujinami
he
paused
at
the
word
son
his
employer
had
caught
his
meaning
and
was
frowning
more
than
ever
at
last
he
answered
to
expect
too
much
is
a
dangerous
thing
to
choose
a
adopted
son
is
a
difficult
question
i
myself
can
not
decide
such
grave
matters
there
must
be
consultation
with
the
rest
of
the
fujinami
family
you
yourself
have
suggested
that
governor
sugiwara
might
perhaps
be
a
suitable
person
at
that
time
the
talk
was
of
sada
san
this
time
the
talk
is
of
asa
san
a
flash
of
inspiration
struck
fujinami
gentaro
and
a
gush
of
relief
by
giving
her
to
ito
he
might
be
able
to
asako
and
leave
the
highway
to
inheritance
free
for
his
own
daughter
but
ito
had
grown
too
powerful
to
be
altogether
trusted
it
must
be
clearly
understood
said
the
master
that
it
is
the
husband
of
our
sada
who
will
be
the
fujinami
ito
bowed
thanks
to
the
master
he
said
there
is
money
in
plenty
there
is
no
desire
to
speak
of
such
matters
the
request
is
for
asa
san
only
truly
the
heart
is
speaking
that
girl
is
a
beautiful
child
and
altogether
a
person
my
wife
is
old
and
barren
and
of
low
class
i
wish
to
have
a
wife
who
is
worthy
of
my
position
in
the
house
of
fujinami
san
the
head
of
the
family
cackled
with
sudden
laughter
he
was
much
relieved
ha
ha
ito
kun
so
it
is
love
is
it
you
are
in
love
like
a
school
student
well
indeed
love
is
a
good
thing
what
you
have
said
shall
be
well
considered
so
the
lawyer
was
dismissed
accordingly
at
the
next
family
council
fujinami
put
forward
the
proposal
that
asako
should
be
married
forthwith
to
the
family
factotum
who
should
be
given
a
lump
sum
down
in
consideration
for
a
surrender
of
all
further
claim
in
his
own
name
or
his
wife
to
any
share
in
the
family
capital
ito
kun
he
concluded
is
the
brain
of
our
business
he
is
the
family
prime
minister
i
think
it
would
be
well
to
give
this
asa
to
him
to
his
surprise
the
proposal
met
with
unanimous
opposition
the
rest
of
the
family
envied
and
disliked
ito
who
was
regarded
as
fujinami
pampered
favourite
grandfather
gennosuké
was
especially
indignant
what
he
exploded
in
one
of
those
fits
of
rage
common
to
old
men
in
japan
give
the
daughter
of
the
elder
branch
to
a
butler
to
a
man
whose
father
ran
between
rickshaw
shafts
if
the
spirit
of
katsundo
has
not
heard
this
foolish
talk
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
us
already
there
is
a
bad
by
doing
such
a
thing
it
will
become
worse
and
worse
until
the
whole
house
of
fujinami
is
ruined
this
ito
is
a
rascal
a
thief
a
a
the
old
gentleman
collapsed
again
the
council
separated
still
undecided
except
for
one
thing
that
the
claim
of
ito
to
the
hand
of
asako
was
quite
inadmissible
when
the
family
prime
minister
next
pressed
his
master
on
the
subject
fujinami
had
to
confess
that
the
proposal
had
been
rejected
then
ito
unmasked
his
batteries
and
his
patron
had
to
realize
that
the
servant
was
a
servant
no
longer
ito
said
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
have
asa
san
and
that
before
the
end
of
the
year
he
was
in
love
with
this
girl
passion
was
an
overwhelming
thing
two
things
have
ever
been
the
same
since
the
age
of
the
gods
the
flowing
of
water
and
the
way
of
love
this
old
japanese
poem
he
quoted
as
his
excuse
for
what
would
otherwise
be
an
inexcusable
impertinence
the
master
was
aware
that
politics
in
japan
were
in
an
unsettled
state
and
that
the
new
cabinet
was
scarcely
established
that
a
storm
would
overthrow
it
and
that
the
opposition
were
already
looking
about
for
a
suitable
scandal
to
use
for
their
revenge
he
ito
held
the
evidence
which
they
desired
the
full
story
of
the
tobita
concession
with
the
names
and
details
of
the
enormous
bribes
distributed
by
the
fujinami
if
these
things
were
published
the
government
would
certainly
fall
also
the
tobita
concession
would
be
lost
and
the
whole
of
that
great
outlay
also
the
fujinami
leading
political
friends
would
be
discredited
and
ruined
there
would
be
a
big
trial
and
exposure
and
outcry
and
judgment
and
prison
the
master
must
excuse
his
servant
for
speaking
so
rudely
to
his
benefactor
but
in
love
there
are
no
scruples
and
he
must
have
asa
san
after
all
after
his
long
service
was
his
request
so
unreasonable
fujinami
gentaro
thoroughly
scared
protested
that
he
himself
was
in
favour
of
the
match
he
begged
for
time
so
as
to
be
able
to
convert
the
other
members
of
the
family
council
perhaps
suggested
ito
if
asa
san
were
sent
away
from
akasaka
perhaps
if
she
were
living
alone
it
would
be
more
easy
to
manage
what
is
absent
is
soon
forgotten
fujinami
gennosuké
is
a
very
old
gentleman
he
would
soon
forget
sada
san
could
then
take
her
proper
position
as
the
only
daughter
of
the
fujinami
was
there
not
a
small
house
by
the
river
side
at
mukojima
which
had
been
rented
for
asa
san
perhaps
she
would
like
to
live
there
quite
alone
perhaps
ito
kun
would
visit
her
from
time
to
time
said
fujinami
pleased
with
the
idea
she
will
be
so
lonely
there
is
no
knowing
the
one
person
who
was
never
consulted
and
who
had
not
the
remotest
notion
of
what
was
going
on
was
asako
herself
asako
was
most
unhappy
the
disappearance
of
fujinami
takeshi
exasperated
the
competition
between
herself
and
her
cousin
just
as
formerly
all
sadako
intelligence
and
charm
had
been
exerted
to
attract
her
english
relative
to
the
house
in
akasaka
so
now
she
applied
all
her
force
to
drive
her
cousin
out
of
the
family
circle
for
many
weeks
now
asako
had
been
ignored
but
after
the
return
from
ikégami
a
positive
persecution
commenced
although
the
nights
were
growing
chilly
she
was
given
no
extra
bedding
her
meals
were
no
longer
served
to
her
she
had
to
get
what
she
could
from
the
kitchen
the
servants
imitating
their
mistress
attitude
were
deliberately
disobliging
and
rude
to
the
little
foreigner
sadako
and
her
mother
would
sneer
at
her
awkwardness
and
at
her
ignorance
of
japanese
customs
her
was
tied
anyhow
for
she
had
no
maid
her
hair
was
untidy
for
she
was
not
allowed
a
hairdresser
they
nicknamed
her
goat
face
using
an
ugly
slang
word
for
a
foreigner
japanese
mistress
and
they
would
pretend
that
she
smelt
like
a
european
stink
stink
they
would
say
the
war
even
was
used
to
bait
asako
every
german
success
was
greeted
with
acclamation
the
exploits
of
the
were
loudly
praised
and
the
tragedy
of
coronel
was
gloated
over
with
satisfaction
the
germans
will
win
because
they
are
brave
said
sadako
the
english
lose
too
many
prisoners
japanese
soldiers
are
never
taken
prisoner
when
the
japanese
general
ordered
the
attack
on
tsingtao
the
english
regiment
ran
away
cousin
sadako
announced
her
intention
of
studying
german
nobody
will
speak
english
now
she
said
the
english
are
disgraced
they
can
not
fight
i
wish
japan
would
make
war
on
the
english
asako
answered
bitterly
you
would
get
such
a
beating
that
you
would
never
boast
again
look
at
my
husband
she
added
proudly
he
is
so
big
and
strong
and
brave
he
could
pick
up
two
or
three
japanese
generals
like
toys
and
knock
their
heads
together
even
fujinami
gentaro
joined
once
or
twice
in
these
debates
and
announced
sententiously
twenty
years
ago
japan
defeated
china
and
took
korea
ten
years
ago
we
defeated
russia
and
took
manchuria
this
year
we
defeat
germany
and
take
tsingtao
in
ten
years
we
shall
defeat
america
and
take
hawaii
and
the
philippines
in
twenty
years
we
shall
defeat
england
and
take
india
and
australia
then
we
japanese
shall
be
the
most
powerful
nation
in
the
world
this
is
our
divine
mission
it
was
characteristic
of
the
loyalty
of
asako
nature
that
although
very
ignorant
of
the
war
of
its
causes
and
its
vicissitudes
yet
she
remained
fiercely
true
to
england
and
the
allies
and
could
never
accept
the
japanese
detachment
above
all
the
thought
of
her
husband
danger
haunted
her
waking
and
sleeping
she
could
see
him
sword
in
hand
leading
his
men
to
desperate
struggles
like
those
portrayed
in
the
crude
japanese
chromographs
which
sadako
showed
her
to
play
upon
her
fears
poor
asako
how
she
hated
japan
now
how
she
loathed
the
cramped
draughty
uncomfortable
life
how
she
feared
the
smiling
faces
and
the
watchful
eyes
from
which
it
seemed
she
never
could
escape
christmas
was
at
hand
the
season
of
pretty
presents
and
good
things
to
eat
her
last
christmas
she
had
spent
with
geoffrey
on
the
riviera
lady
everington
had
been
there
they
had
watched
the
pigeon
shooting
in
the
warm
sunlight
they
had
gone
to
the
opera
in
the
evening
butterfly
asako
had
imagined
herself
in
the
rôle
of
the
heroine
so
gentle
so
faithful
waiting
and
waiting
in
her
little
wooden
house
for
the
big
white
husband
who
never
came
what
was
that
she
heard
the
guns
of
his
ship
saluting
the
harbour
he
was
coming
back
to
her
at
last
but
not
alone
a
woman
was
with
him
a
white
woman
alone
in
her
bare
room
her
only
companion
a
flaky
yellow
chrysanthemum
nodding
in
the
draught
asako
sobbed
and
sobbed
as
though
her
heart
were
breaking
somebody
tapped
at
the
sliding
shutter
asako
could
not
answer
the
was
pushed
open
and
tanaka
entered
asako
was
glad
to
see
him
alone
of
the
household
tanaka
was
still
deferential
in
his
attitude
towards
his
late
mistress
he
was
always
ready
to
talk
about
the
old
times
which
gave
her
a
bitter
pleasure
if
ladyship
is
so
sad
he
began
as
he
had
been
coached
in
his
part
beforehand
by
the
fujinami
why
ladyship
stay
in
this
house
change
house
change
trouble
we
say
but
where
can
i
go
asako
asked
helplessly
ladyship
has
pretty
house
by
river
brink
suggested
tanaka
ladyship
can
stay
two
month
three
month
then
the
springtime
come
and
ladyship
feel
quite
happy
again
even
i
in
the
winter
season
i
find
the
mind
very
distress
it
is
often
so
to
be
alone
to
be
free
from
the
daily
insults
and
cruelty
this
in
itself
would
be
happiness
to
asako
but
will
fujinami
allow
me
to
go
she
asked
timorously
ladyship
must
be
brave
said
the
counselor
ladyship
is
not
prisoner
ladyship
must
say
i
go
but
perhaps
i
can
arrange
matter
for
ladyship
oh
tanaka
please
please
do
i
so
unhappy
here
i
will
hire
cook
and
maid
for
ladyship
i
myself
will
be
seneschal
fujinami
gentaro
and
his
family
were
delighted
to
hear
that
their
plan
was
working
so
smoothly
and
that
they
could
so
easily
get
rid
of
their
embarrassing
cousin
the
seneschal
was
instructed
at
once
to
see
about
arrangements
for
the
house
which
had
not
been
lived
in
since
its
new
tenancy
next
evening
when
asako
had
spread
the
two
quilts
on
the
golden
matting
when
she
had
lit
the
rushlight
in
the
square
when
the
two
girls
were
lying
side
by
side
under
the
heavy
wadded
bedclothes
sadako
said
to
her
cousin
asa
chan
i
do
not
think
you
like
me
now
as
much
as
you
used
to
like
me
i
always
like
people
when
i
have
once
liked
them
said
asako
but
everything
is
different
now
i
see
your
heart
changes
quickly
said
her
cousin
bitterly
no
i
have
tried
to
change
but
i
can
not
change
i
have
tried
to
become
japanese
but
i
can
not
even
learn
the
japanese
language
i
do
not
like
the
japanese
way
of
living
in
france
and
in
england
i
was
always
happy
i
do
think
i
shall
ever
be
happy
again
you
ought
to
be
more
grateful
said
sadako
severely
we
have
saved
you
from
your
husband
who
was
cruel
and
deceitful
no
i
do
believe
that
now
my
husband
and
i
loved
each
other
always
you
people
came
between
us
with
wicked
lies
and
separated
us
anyhow
you
have
made
the
choice
you
have
chosen
to
be
japanese
you
can
never
be
english
again
the
fujinami
had
hypnotized
asako
with
this
phrase
as
a
hen
can
be
hypnotized
with
a
chalk
line
day
after
day
it
was
dinned
into
her
ears
cutting
off
all
hope
of
escape
from
the
country
or
of
appeal
to
her
english
friends
you
had
better
marry
a
japanese
said
sadako
or
you
will
become
old
maid
why
not
marry
ito
san
he
says
he
likes
you
he
is
a
clever
man
he
has
plenty
of
money
he
is
used
to
foreign
ways
marry
mr
ito
asako
exclaimed
aghast
but
he
has
a
wife
already
they
will
divorce
it
is
no
trouble
there
are
not
even
children
i
would
rather
die
than
marry
any
japanese
said
asako
with
conviction
sadako
fujinami
turned
her
back
and
pretended
to
sleep
but
long
through
the
dark
cold
night
asako
could
feel
her
turning
restlessly
to
and
fro
some
time
about
midnight
asako
heard
her
name
called
asa
chan
are
you
awake
yes
is
anything
the
matter
asa
chan
in
your
house
by
the
river
you
will
be
lonely
you
will
not
be
afraid
i
am
not
afraid
to
be
lonely
asako
answered
i
am
afraid
of
people
look
said
her
cousin
i
give
you
this
she
drew
from
the
bosom
of
her
kimono
the
short
sword
in
its
sheath
of
shagreen
which
asako
had
seen
once
or
twice
before
it
is
very
old
she
continued
it
belonged
to
my
mother
people
they
were
of
the
sendai
clan
in
old
japan
every
noble
girl
carried
such
a
short
sword
for
she
said
death
than
dishonour
when
the
time
came
to
die
she
would
strike
here
in
the
throat
not
too
hard
but
pushing
strongly
but
first
she
would
tie
her
feet
together
with
the
the
silk
string
which
you
have
to
hold
your
straight
that
was
in
case
the
legs
open
too
much
she
must
not
die
in
immodest
attitude
so
when
general
nogi
did
at
emperor
meiji
funeral
his
wife
countess
nogi
killed
herself
also
with
such
a
sword
i
give
you
my
sword
because
in
the
house
by
the
river
you
will
be
lonely
and
things
might
happen
i
can
never
use
the
sword
myself
now
it
was
the
sword
of
my
ancestors
i
am
not
pure
now
i
can
not
use
the
sword
if
i
kill
myself
i
throw
myself
into
the
river
like
a
common
i
think
it
is
best
you
marry
ito
in
japan
it
is
bad
to
have
a
husband
but
to
have
no
husband
it
is
worse

afar
moon
of
the
mountain
fringe
some
days
before
christmas
asako
had
moved
into
her
own
little
home
to
be
free
to
have
escaped
from
the
watchful
eyes
and
the
whispering
tongues
to
be
at
liberty
to
walk
about
the
streets
and
to
visit
the
shops
as
an
independent
lady
of
japan
these
were
such
unfamiliar
joys
to
her
that
for
a
time
she
forgot
how
unhappy
she
really
was
and
how
she
longed
for
geoffrey
company
as
of
old
only
in
the
evenings
a
sense
of
insecurity
rose
with
the
river
mists
and
a
memory
of
sadako
warning
shivered
through
the
lonely
room
with
the
bitter
cold
of
the
winter
air
it
was
then
that
asako
felt
for
the
little
dagger
resting
hidden
in
her
bosom
just
as
sadako
had
shown
her
how
to
wear
it
it
was
then
that
she
did
not
like
to
be
alone
and
that
she
summoned
tanaka
to
keep
her
company
and
to
while
away
the
time
with
his
quaint
loquacity
considering
that
he
had
been
largely
instrumental
in
breaking
up
her
happy
life
considering
that
every
day
he
stole
from
her
and
lied
to
her
it
was
wonderful
that
his
mistress
was
still
so
attached
to
him
that
in
fact
she
regarded
him
as
her
only
friend
he
was
like
a
bad
habit
or
an
old
disease
which
we
almost
come
to
cherish
since
we
can
not
be
delivered
from
it
but
when
tanaka
protested
his
devotion
did
he
mean
what
he
said
there
is
a
bedrock
of
loyalty
in
the
japanese
nature
down
the
road
to
shame
it
will
halt
of
a
sudden
and
bungle
back
its
way
to
honour
then
there
is
the
love
of
the
which
is
an
even
stronger
motive
very
often
than
the
love
of
for
its
own
sake
the
favorite
character
of
the
japanese
drama
is
the
the
chivalrous
champion
of
the
common
people
who
rescues
beauty
in
distress
from
the
lawless
bullying
men
it
tickled
tanaka
remarkable
vanity
to
regard
himself
as
the
protector
of
this
lonely
and
unfortunate
lady
it
might
be
said
of
him
as
of
lancelot
that
his
honour
rooted
in
dishonour
stood
and
faith
unfaithful
kept
him
falsely
true
asako
was
glad
on
the
whole
that
she
had
no
visitors
the
fujinami
were
busy
with
their
new
year
preparations
christmas
day
passed
by
unheeded
by
the
japanese
though
the
personality
and
appearance
of
santa
claus
are
not
unknown
to
them
he
stands
in
the
big
shop
windows
in
tokyo
as
in
london
with
his
red
cloak
his
long
white
beard
and
his
sack
full
of
toys
sometimes
he
is
to
be
seen
chatting
with
buddhist
deities
with
the
daikoku
with
ebisu
the
fisherman
with
fat
naked
hotei
and
with
benten
the
fair
but
frail
in
fact
with
the
american
billiken
santa
claus
may
be
considered
as
the
latest
addition
to
the
tolerant
theocracy
of
japan
asako
attended
high
mass
at
the
catholic
cathedral
in
tsukiji
the
old
foreign
settlement
the
music
was
crude
and
there
was
a
long
sermon
in
japanese
the
magnificent
bearded
bishop
who
officiated
was
flanked
by
two
native
priests
but
the
familiar
sounds
and
movements
of
the
office
soothed
her
and
the
fragrance
of
the
incense
the
centre
of
the
aisle
was
covered
with
straw
mats
where
the
japanese
congregation
was
squatting
chairs
for
the
foreigners
were
placed
in
the
side
aisles
these
were
mostly
members
of
the
various
embassy
and
legation
staffs
for
a
moment
asako
feared
recognition
then
she
remembered
how
entirely
japanese
she
had
become
in
appearance
ito
called
during
the
afternoon
to
wish
a
merry
christmas
asako
regaled
him
with
thin
green
tea
and
little
square
cakes
of
ground
rice
filled
with
a
kind
of
bean
paste
called
she
kept
tanaka
in
the
room
all
the
time
for
sadako
remarks
about
marriage
with
ito
had
alarmed
her
he
was
most
agreeable
however
and
most
courteous
he
amused
asako
with
stories
of
his
experiences
abroad
he
admired
the
pretty
little
house
and
its
position
on
the
river
bank
and
when
he
bowed
his
thanks
for
asako
hospitality
he
expressed
a
wish
that
he
might
come
again
many
times
in
future
i
am
afraid
of
him
asako
had
confided
to
tanaka
when
the
guest
had
departed
because
sada
san
said
that
he
wants
to
divorce
his
wife
and
marry
me
you
are
to
stop
here
with
me
in
the
room
whenever
he
comes
do
not
leave
me
alone
please
ladyship
is
the
round
face
answered
tanaka
is
faithful
tanaka
gives
life
for
ladyship
it
was
the
week
before
new
year
all
along
the
ginza
which
is
the
main
thoroughfare
of
tokyo
along
the
avenue
of
slender
willow
trees
which
do
their
gallant
utmost
to
break
the
monotony
of
the
wide
ramshackle
street
were
spread
every
evening
the
of
the
the
night
shops
which
cater
their
most
diverse
wares
for
the
aimless
multitudes
sauntering
up
and
down
the
sidewalks
there
are
quack
medicines
and
stylograph
pens
clean
wooden
altar
cabinets
for
the
kitchen
gods
and
images
of
daikoku
and
ebisu
there
are
cheap
underclothing
and
old
hats
food
of
various
kinds
boots
and
books
and
toys
but
most
fascinating
of
all
are
the
antiquities
strewn
over
a
square
six
feet
of
ground
are
curios
most
attractive
to
the
unwary
especially
by
the
deceptive
light
of
kerosene
lamps
one
in
a
thousand
perhaps
may
be
a
piece
of
real
value
but
almost
every
object
has
a
character
and
a
charm
of
its
own
there
are
old
gold
screens
lacquer
tables
and
cabinets
bronze
vases
gilded
buddhas
fans
woodcuts
porcelains
hanging
pictures
illustrated
scrolls
lacquer
medicine
boxes
for
the
pocket
ivory
or
bone
buttons
through
which
the
cords
of
the
tobacco
pouch
are
slung
sword
hilts
of
iron
ornamented
with
delightful
landscapes
of
gold
and
silver
inlay
the
ginza
at
is
a
paradise
for
the
minor
collector
wa
how
much
is
this
asked
asako
picking
up
a
tiny
silver
box
which
could
slip
into
a
waistcoat
pocket
inside
were
enshrined
three
gentle
buddhas
of
old
creamy
ivory
perfectly
carved
to
the
minutest
petal
of
the
lotus
upon
which
each
reposed
indeed
it
is
the
end
of
the
year
we
must
sell
all
things
cheaply
answered
the
merchant
it
is
asked
sixty
for
true
ancient
artistic
object
such
a
thing
is
not
said
replied
asako
her
japanese
becoming
quite
fluent
with
the
return
of
her
perhaps
a
joke
is
being
made
it
would
be
possible
to
give
ten
the
old
curio
vender
with
the
face
and
spare
figure
of
julius
caesar
turned
aside
from
such
idle
talk
with
a
shrug
of
hopelessness
he
affected
to
be
more
interested
in
lighting
his
slender
pipe
over
the
chimney
of
the
lamp
which
hung
suspended
over
his
wares
ten
please
see
said
asako
showing
a
banknote
the
merchant
shook
his
head
and
puffed
asako
turned
away
into
the
stream
of
she
had
not
gone
ten
yards
however
before
she
felt
a
touch
on
her
kimono
sleeve
it
was
julius
caesar
with
his
curio
indeed
there
must
be
reduction
thirty
take
it
please
he
pressed
the
little
box
into
asako
hand
twenty
she
bargained
holding
out
two
notes
it
is
loss
it
is
loss
he
murmured
but
he
shuffled
back
to
his
stall
again
very
well
content
i
shall
send
it
to
geoffrey
thought
asako
it
will
bring
him
good
luck
perhaps
he
will
write
to
me
and
thank
me
then
i
can
write
to
him
the
new
year
is
the
greatest
of
japanese
festivals
japanese
of
the
middle
and
lower
classes
live
all
the
year
round
in
a
thickening
web
of
debt
but
during
the
last
days
of
the
year
these
complications
are
supposed
to
be
unraveled
and
the
defaulting
debtor
must
sell
some
of
his
family
goods
and
start
the
new
year
with
a
clean
slate
these
operations
swell
the
of
the
on
new
year
day
the
wife
prepares
the
cakes
of
ground
rice
which
are
the
specialities
of
the
season
and
the
husband
sees
to
the
erection
of
his
door
posts
of
the
two
corner
pine
trees
little
christmas
trees
planted
in
a
coil
of
rope
then
attired
in
his
and
top
hat
if
he
be
a
gentleman
or
in
his
best
kimono
and
if
he
be
an
japanese
he
goes
round
in
a
rickshaw
to
pay
his
complimentary
calls
and
to
exchange
medet
respectfully
lucky
the
new
year
wish
he
has
presents
for
his
important
patrons
and
cards
for
his
less
influential
acquaintances
for
as
the
japanese
proverb
says
gifts
preserve
friendship
at
each
house
which
he
visits
he
sips
a
cup
of
so
that
his
return
home
is
often
due
to
the
rickshaw
man
assistance
rather
than
to
his
own
powers
of
in
fact
as
maid
confided
to
her
mistress
japanese
wife
very
happy
when
new
year
time
all
finish
on
the
night
following
new
year
snow
fell
it
continued
to
fall
all
the
next
morning
until
asako
little
garden
was
as
white
as
a
the
irregularities
of
her
lawn
were
smoothed
out
under
the
white
carpet
the
straw
coverings
which
a
foresight
had
wrapped
round
the
azalea
shrubs
and
the
dwarf
conifers
were
enfolded
in
a
thick
white
shroud
like
tufts
of
foam
on
a
wave
the
snow
was
tossed
on
the
plumes
of
the
bamboo
clump
which
hid
the
neighbour
dwelling
and
made
a
bird
nest
of
asako
tiny
domain
beyond
the
brown
sluggish
river
the
roofs
and
pinnacles
of
asakusa
were
more
than
a
theatre
scene
asako
was
thinking
of
that
first
day
which
introduced
geoffrey
and
her
to
the
embassy
and
to
yaé
smith
she
shivered
darkness
was
falling
a
japanese
house
is
a
frail
protection
in
winter
time
and
a
charcoal
fire
in
a
wooden
box
is
poor
company
the
maid
came
in
to
close
the
shutters
for
the
night
where
was
tanaka
he
had
gone
out
to
a
new
year
party
with
relatives
asako
felt
her
loneliness
all
of
a
sudden
and
she
was
grateful
for
the
moral
comfort
of
cousin
sadako
sword
she
drew
it
from
its
sheath
and
examined
the
blade
and
the
fine
work
on
the
hilt
with
care
and
alarm
like
a
man
fingering
a
serpent
no
sooner
was
the
house
silenced
than
the
wind
arose
it
smote
the
wooden
framework
with
an
unexpected
buffet
almost
like
an
earthquake
the
bamboo
grove
began
to
rattle
like
bones
and
the
snow
slid
and
fell
from
the
roof
in
dull
thuds
there
was
a
sharp
rap
at
the
front
door
asako
started
and
thrust
the
dagger
into
the
breast
of
her
kimono
she
had
been
lying
full
length
on
a
long
deckchair
now
she
put
her
feet
to
the
ground
o
hana
the
maid
came
in
and
announced
that
ito
san
had
called
asako
and
gave
instructions
for
him
to
be
shown
in
she
heard
a
stumbling
on
the
steps
of
her
house
then
ito
lurched
into
the
room
his
face
was
very
red
and
his
voice
thick
he
had
been
paying
many
new
year
calls
happy
new
year
asa
san
happy

hiccoughed
grasping
her

and
down

was
sprawling
in
the
deck
chair
which
divided
the
little
into
two
parts
and
cut
off
asako
retreat
she
was
trembling
on
a
bamboo
stool
near

shuttered
window

ito
rolling
out
of
his
chair
and
putting
one
heavy
leg
to
the
ground
he
was
earing
a
kimono
none
too
well
adjusted
and
asako
could
see
his
hairy
limb
high
up
the
thigh
her
face
must
have
reflected
her
displeasure
what
the
japanese
shouted

time

fine
time
asako
felt
helpless
her
hand
was
on
the
hilt
of
her
dagger
but
she
still
hoped
that
ito
might
come
to
his
senses
and
go
away
there
he
cried
i
know
foreign
custom
i
know
everything
mistletoe
mistletoe
a
kiss
for
the
mistletoe
asa
san
he
staggered
out
of
his
chair
and
came
towards
her
like
a
great
black
bird
she
dodged
him
and
tried
to
escape
round
the
deck
chair
but
he
caught
hold
of
her
kimono
she
drew
her
sword
help
help
she
cried
tanaka
something
wrenched
at
her
wrist
and
the
blade
fell
at
the
same
moment
the
inner
flew
open
like
the
shutter
of
a
camera
tanaka
rushed
into
the
room
asako
did
not
turn
to
look
again
until
she
was
outside
the
room
with
her
maid
and
her
cook
trembling
beside
her
then
she
saw
tanaka
and
ito
locked
in
a
wrestler
embrace
puffing
and
grunting
at
each
other
while
their
feet
were
fumbling
for
the
sword
which
lay
between
them
suddenly
both
figures
relaxed
two
foreheads
came
together
with
a
wooden
concussion
hands
were
groping
where
the
feet
had
been
one
set
of
fingers
hovering
over
the
sword
grasped
the
hilt
it
was
tanaka
but
his
foot
slipped
he
tottered
and
fell
backward
ito
was
on
the
top
of
him
asako
closed
her
eyes
she
heard
a
hoarse
roar
like
a
lion
when
she
dared
to
look
again
she
saw
tanaka
kneeling
over
ito
body
with
a
wrench
he
pulled
sadako
dagger
out
of
the
prostrate
mass
it
was
followed
by
a
jet
of
blood
and
then
by
a
steady
trickle
from
body
mouth
and
nostrils
which
spread
over
the
matting
slowly
and
deliberately
tanaka
wiped
first
the
knife
and
then
his
hands
on
the
clothes
of
his
victim
then
he
felt
his
mouth
and
throat
there
finished
he
said
he
turned
towards
the
garden
side
threw
open
the
and
the
he
ran
across
the
lawn
and
from
beyond
the
unearthly
silence
which
followed
his
departure
come
the
distant
sound
of
a
splash
in
the
river
at
last
asako
said
helplessly
is
he
dead
the
cook
a
man
was
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
escape
i
go
and
call
doctor
he
said
no
stay
with
me
said
asako
i
am
afraid
o
hana
can
go
for
the
doctor
asako
and
the
cook
waited
by
the
open
staring
blankly
at
the
body
of
ito
presently
the
cook
said
that
he
must
go
and
get
something
he
did
not
return
asako
called
to
him
to
come
there
was
no
answer
she
went
to
look
for
him
in
his
little
room
near
the
kitchen
it
was
empty
he
had
packed
his
few
chattels
in
his
wicker
basket
and
had
decamped
asako
resumed
her
watch
at
the
door
an
unwilling
rizpah
it
was
as
though
she
feared
that
if
she
left
her
post
somebody
might
come
in
and
steal
ito
but
she
could
have
hardly
approached
the
corpse
even
under
compulsion
sometimes
it
seemed
to
move
to
try
to
rise
but
it
was
stuck
fast
to
the
matting
by
the
resinous
flow
of
purple
blood
sometimes
it
seemed
to
speak
mistletoe
mistletoe
kiss
me
asa
san
gusts
of
cold
wind
came
in
from
the
open
windows
touching
the
dead
man
curiously
turning
over
his
kimono
sleeves
outside
the
bamboo
grove
was
rattling
like
bones
and
the
caked
snow
fell
from
the
roof
in
heavy
thuds
o
hana
returned
with
a
doctor
and
a
policeman
the
doctor
loosened
ito
kimono
and
at
once
shook
his
head
the
policeman
wore
a
blue
uniform
and
cape
and
a
sword
dragged
at
his
side
he
had
produced
a
notebook
and
a
pencil
from
a
breast
pocket
what
is
your
name
he
asked
asako
what
is
your
age
your
and
mother
name
what
is
your
address
are
you
married
where
is
your
husband
how
long
have
you
known
this
man
were
you
on
familiar
terms
did
you
kill
him
how
did
you
kill
him
why
did
you
kill
him
the
questions
buzzed
round
asako
head
like
a
swarm
of
hornets
it
had
never
occurred
to
the
unfortunate
girl
that
any
suspicion
could
fall
upon
her
three
more
policemen
had
arrived
every
one
in
this
house
is
arrested
announced
the
first
policeman
put
out
your
hands
he
ordered
asako
rusty
handcuffs
were
slipped
over
her
delicate
wrists
one
of
the
policemen
had
produced
a
coil
of
rope
which
he
proceeded
to
tie
round
her
waist
and
then
round
the
waist
of
o
hana
but
what
have
i
done
asked
asako
plaintively
the
policeman
took
no
notice
she
could
hear
two
of
them
upstairs
in
her
bedroom
talking
and
laughing
knocking
open
her
boxes
and
throwing
things
about
asako
and
her
maid
were
led
out
of
the
house
like
two
performing
animals
it
was
bitterly
cold
and
asako
had
no
cloak
the
road
was
already
full
of
loafers
they
stared
angrily
at
asako
some
laughed
some
pulled
at
her
kimono
as
she
passed
she
heard
one
say
it
is
a
she
has
murdered
her
sweetheart
at
the
police
station
asako
had
to
undergo
the
same
confusing
interrogatory
before
the
chief
inspector
what
is
your
name
what
is
your
age
where
do
you
live
what
are
your
father
and
mother
names
lies
are
no
good
said
the
inspector
a
burly
unshaven
man
confess
that
you
have
killed
this
man
but
i
did
not
kill
him
protested
asako
who
killed
him
then
you
must
know
that
said
the
inspector
triumphantly
it
was
tanaka
said
asako
who
is
this
tanaka
the
inspector
asked
the
policeman
i
do
not
know
perhaps
it
is
lies
he
answered
sulkily
but
it
is
not
lies
expostulated
asako
he
ran
away
through
the
window
you
can
see
his
footmarks
in
the
snow
did
you
see
the
marks
the
policeman
was
asked
no
perhaps
there
were
no
marks
did
you
look
i
did
not
look
actually
but
you
a
fool
said
the
inspector
the
weary
questioning
continued
for
quite
two
hours
until
asako
had
told
her
story
of
the
murder
at
least
three
times
the
unfamiliar
language
confused
her
and
the
reiterated
refrain
you
now
confess
you
killed
the
man
asako
was
chilled
to
the
bone
her
head
was
aching
her
eyes
were
aching
her
legs
were
aching
with
the
ordeal
of
standing
she
felt
that
they
must
soon
give
way
altogether
at
last
the
inspector
closed
his
he
ejaculated
it
is
past
midnight
even
i
must
sleep
sometimes
take
her
away
to
the
court
and
lock
her
in
the
the
procurator
will
examine
at
nine
she
is
pretending
to
be
silly
and
not
understanding
so
she
is
probably
guilty
again
the
handcuffs
and
the
degrading
rope
were
fastened
upon
her
she
felt
that
she
had
already
been
condemned
may
i
send
word
to
my
friends
she
asked
surely
even
the
fujinami
would
not
abandon
her
to
her
fate
no
the
procurator
examination
has
not
yet
taken
place
after
that
sometimes
permission
can
be
granted
that
is
the
law
she
was
left
waiting
in
a
where
eight
or
nine
policemen
stared
at
her
impertinently
a
pretty
face
eh
they
said
it
looks
like
a
who
is
taking
her
to
the
court
it
is
ishibashi
oh
so
he
is
always
the
lucky
chap
a
rough
fellow
thrust
his
hand
up
her
kimono
sleeve
and
caught
hold
of
her
bare
arm
near
the
shoulder
here
ishibashi
he
cried
you
have
caught
a
fine
bird
this
time
the
policeman
ishibashi
picked
up
the
loose
end
of
the
rope
and
drove
asako
before
him
into
a
closed
van
which
was
soon
rumbling
along
the
deserted
streets
she
was
made
to
alight
at
a
tall
stone
building
where
they
passed
down
several
echoing
corridors
until
at
the
end
of
a
little
passage
a
warder
pushed
open
a
door
this
was
the
sty
where
prisoners
are
kept
pending
examination
in
the
procurator
court
the
floor
and
walls
were
of
stone
it
was
bitterly
cold
there
was
no
window
no
light
no
firebox
and
no
chair
alone
in
the
petrifying
darkness
her
teeth
chattering
her
limbs
trembling
poor
asako
huddled
her
misery
into
a
corner
of
the
dirty
cell
to
await
the
further
tender
mercies
of
the
japanese
criminal
code
she
could
hear
the
scuttering
of
rats
had
she
been
ten
times
guilty
she
felt
that
she
could
not
have
suffered
more
daylight
began
to
show
under
the
crack
of
the
door
later
on
a
warder
came
and
beckoned
to
asako
to
follow
him
she
had
not
touched
food
for
twenty
hours
but
nothing
was
offered
to
her
she
was
led
into
a
room
with
benches
like
a
schoolroom
at
the
master
desk
sat
a
small
spotted
man
with
a
cloak
like
a
scholar
gown
and
a
black
cap
with
ribbons
like
a
highlander
bonnet
this
was
the
procurator
at
his
side
sat
his
clerk
similarly
but
less
sprucely
garbed
asako
utterly
weary
was
preparing
to
sit
down
on
one
of
the
benches
the
warder
pulled
her
up
by
the
nape
of
her
kimono
she
had
to
stand
during
her
examination
what
is
your
name
what
is
your
age
what
are
your
father
and
mother
names
the
monotonous
questions
were
repeated
all
over
again
and
then
to
confess
were
better
when
you
confess
we
shall
let
you
go
if
you
do
not
confess
we
keep
you
here
for
days
and
days
i
am
feeling
sick
pleaded
asako
may
i
eat
something
the
warder
brought
a
cup
of
tea
and
some
salt
biscuit
now
confess
bullied
the
procurator
if
you
do
not
confess
you
will
get
no
more
to
eat
asako
told
her
story
of
the
murder
she
then
told
it
again
her
japanese
words
were
slipping
from
the
clutch
of
her
worn
brain
she
was
saying
things
she
did
not
mean
how
could
she
defend
herself
in
a
language
which
was
strange
to
her
mind
how
could
she
make
this
judge
who
seemed
so
pitiless
and
so
hostile
to
her
understand
and
believe
her
broken
sentences
she
was
beating
with
a
paper
sword
against
an
armed
enemy
an
interpreter
was
sent
for
and
the
questions
were
all
repeated
in
english
the
procurator
was
annoyed
at
asako
refusal
to
speak
in
japanese
he
thought
that
it
was
obstinacy
or
that
she
was
trying
to
fool
him
he
seemed
quite
convinced
that
she
was
guilty
i
ca
answer
any
more
questions
i
really
ca
i
am
sick
said
asako
in
tears
take
her
back
to
the
while
we
have
lunch
ordered
the
procurator
i
think
this
afternoon
she
will
confess
asako
was
taken
away
and
thrust
into
the
horrible
cell
again
she
collapsed
on
the
hard
floor
in
a
state
which
was
partly
a
and
partly
the
sleep
of
exhaustion
dreams
and
images
swept
over
her
brain
like
clouds
it
seemed
to
her
distracted
fancy
that
only
one
person
could
save
her
geoffrey
her
husband
he
must
be
coming
soon
she
thought
that
she
could
hear
his
step
in
the
corridor
geoffrey
geoffrey
she
cried
it
was
the
warder
he
stirred
her
with
his
foot
she
was
hauled
back
to
the
procurator
court
so
have
you
considered
well
said
the
little
spotted
man
will
you
now
confess
how
can
i
confess
what
i
have
not
done
protested
asako
the
remorseless
inquisition
proceeded
asako
replies
became
more
and
more
confused
the
procurator
frowned
at
her
contradictions
she
must
assuredly
be
guilty
how
many
times
do
you
say
that
you
have
met
this
ito
he
asked
asako
was
at
the
end
of
her
strength
she
reeled
and
would
have
fallen
but
the
warder
jerked
her
straight
again
confess
then
shouted
the
procurator
confess
and
you
will
be
liberated
i
will
confess
asako
gasped
anything
you
like
confess
that
you
killed
this
ito
yes
i
confess
then
sign
the
confession
with
the
triumphant
air
of
a
sportsman
who
has
landed
his
fish
after
a
long
and
bitter
struggle
the
procurator
held
out
a
sheet
of
paper
prepared
beforehand
on
which
something
was
written
in
japanese
characters
asako
tried
to
move
towards
the
desk
that
she
might
write
her
name
but
this
time
her
legs
gave
way
altogether
the
warder
caught
her
by
the
neck
of
her
kimono
and
shook
her
as
a
terrier
shakes
a
rat
but
the
body
remained
limp
he
twisted
her
arm
behind
her
with
a
savage
wrench
his
victim
groaned
with
pain
but
spoke
no
distinguishable
word
then
he
laid
her
out
on
the
benches
and
felt
her
chest
the
body
is
very
hot
he
said
perhaps
she
is
indeed
sick
obstinate
grunted
the
procurator
i
am
certain
that
she
is
guilty
are
you
not
he
added
addressing
the
clerk
the
clerk
was
busy
filling
up
some
of
the
blanks
in
the
back
evidence
extemporising
where
he
could
not
remember
assuredly
he
said
the
opinion
of
the
procurator
is
always
correct
however
the
doctor
was
summoned
he
pronounced
that
the
patient
was
in
a
high
fever
and
must
at
once
be
removed
to
the
infirmary
so
the
preliminary
examination
of
asako
fujinami
came
to
an
abrupt
end

the
long
thoughts
of
the
spring
days
will
never
be
forgotten
even
when
autumn
comes
to
the
hearts
of
the
people
the
clouds
of
hallucination
had
fallen
so
close
to
brain
that
her
thoughts
seemed
to
be
caught
up
into
the
dizzy
whirlwind
and
to
be
skimming
around
and
round
the
world
at
the
speed
of
an
express
aeroplane
like
a
clock
whose
regulation
is
out
of
order
the
of
her
life
seemed
to
be
racing
the
and
the
to
be
covering
the
face
of
the
dial
in
sixty
seconds
or
less
returning
incessantly
to
the
same
figures
pausing
awhile
then
jerking
away
again
at
an
insane
rate
from
time
to
time
the
haze
over
the
mind
began
to
clear
and
asako
seemed
to
look
down
upon
the
scene
around
her
from
a
great
height
there
was
a
long
room
so
long
that
she
could
not
see
the
end
of
it
and
rows
of
narrow
beds
and
nurses
dressed
in
white
with
high
caps
like
mitres
who
appeared
and
disappeared
sometimes
they
would
speak
to
her
and
she
would
answer
but
she
did
not
know
what
they
said
nor
what
she
said
to
them
a
gentle
japanese
lady
with
a
very
long
face
sat
on
her
bed
and
talked
to
her
in
english
asako
noticed
that
the
nurses
and
doctors
were
most
deferential
to
this
lady
and
that
after
her
departure
she
was
treated
much
more
kindly
than
before
a
name
kept
peeping
out
of
her
memory
like
a
shy
lizard
out
of
its
hole
but
the
moment
her
brain
tried
to
grab
at
it
it
slipped
back
again
into
oblivion
two
english
ladies
called
together
one
older
and
one
younger
they
talked
about
geoffrey
geoffrey
was
one
of
the
roman
figures
on
the
clock
dial
of
her
mind
they
said
good
things
about
geoffrey
but
she
could
not
remember
what
they
were
one
day
the
japanese
lady
with
the
marked
face
and
one
of
the
nurses
helped
her
to
get
out
of
bed
her
legs
were
trembling
and
her
feet
were
sorely
plagued
by
pins
and
needles
but
she
held
together
somehow
together
they
dressed
her
the
lady
wrapped
a
big
fur
cloak
round
her
and
with
a
supporter
on
either
side
she
was
led
into
the
open
air
where
a
beautiful
was
waiting
there
was
a
crowd
gathered
round
it
but
the
police
kept
them
back
as
asako
stepped
in
she
heard
the
click
of
cameras
asa
chan
said
the
lady
do
you
remember
me
i
am
countess
saito
of
course
asako
remembered
now
a
spring
morning
with
geoffrey
and
the
little
dwarf
trees
the
notoriety
of
the
ito
murder
case
did
asako
a
good
turn
her
friends
in
japan
had
forgotten
her
they
had
imagined
that
she
had
returned
to
england
with
geoffrey
reggie
forsyth
who
alone
knew
the
details
of
her
position
had
thrown
up
his
secretaryship
the
day
that
war
was
declared
and
had
gone
home
to
join
the
army
the
morning
papers
of
january
with
their
account
of
the
mysterious
house
by
the
and
the
japanese
lady
who
could
talk
no
japanese
brought
an
unexpected
shock
to
acquaintances
of
the
barringtons
and
especially
to
lady
cynthia
cairns
and
to
countess
saito
these
ladies
both
made
inquiries
and
learned
that
asako
was
lying
dangerously
ill
in
the
prison
infirmary
a
few
days
later
when
tanaka
was
arrested
and
had
made
a
full
confession
of
the
crime
count
saito
who
knew
how
suspects
fare
at
the
hands
of
a
zealous
procurator
called
in
person
on
the
minister
of
justice
and
secured
asako
speedy
liberation
this
girl
is
a
valuable
asset
to
our
country
he
had
explained
to
the
minister
she
is
married
to
an
englishman
who
will
one
day
be
a
peer
in
england
this
was
a
marriage
of
political
importance
it
was
a
proof
of
the
equal
civilisation
of
our
japan
with
the
great
countries
of
europe
it
is
most
important
that
this
asako
should
be
sent
back
to
england
as
soon
as
possible
and
that
she
should
speak
good
things
about
japan
so
asako
was
released
from
the
procurator
clutches
and
she
was
given
a
charming
little
bedroom
of
her
own
in
the
european
wing
of
the
saito
mansion
the
house
stood
on
a
high
hill
and
asako
seated
at
the
window
could
watch
the
multiplex
activity
of
the
streets
below
the
jolting
tramcars
the
wagons
the
barrows
and
the
rickshaws
to
the
left
was
a
labyrinth
of
little
houses
of
clean
white
wood
bright
and
new
like
toys
with
toy
evergreens
and
bursting
out
of
their
narrow
gardens
this
was
a
quarter
whence
the
sound
of
music
and
quavering
songs
resounded
all
day
long
to
the
right
was
a
big
primary
school
which
with
the
regular
movement
of
tides
sucked
in
and
belched
out
its
flood
of
boys
and
maidens
count
and
countess
saito
despite
their
immense
wealth
and
their
political
importance
were
simple
unostentatious
people
who
seemed
to
devote
most
of
their
thoughts
to
their
children
their
garden
their
dwarf
trees
and
their
breed
of
cocker
spaniels
they
took
their
social
duties
lightly
though
their
home
was
a
mecca
for
needy
relatives
on
the
search
for
jobs
they
gave
generously
they
entertained
hospitably
ruled
the
household
for
husband
and
wife
were
old
partners
and
devoted
friends
count
saito
brought
his
nephew
and
secretary
a
most
agreeable
young
man
to
see
asako
the
count
said
asa
chan
i
want
you
to
tell
sakabé
all
about
the
fujinami
house
and
the
way
of
life
there
so
asako
told
her
story
to
this
interested
listener
fortunately
perhaps
she
could
not
read
the
japanese
newspapers
for
most
of
her
adventures
reappeared
in
the
daily
issues
almost
word
for
word
from
behind
the
scenes
count
saito
was
directing
the
course
of
the
famous
trial
which
had
come
to
be
known
as
the
fujinami
affair
for
the
count
had
certain
political
scores
of
his
own
to
pay
off
and
asako
proved
to
be
a
godsend
tanaka
was
tried
for
murder
but
it
was
established
that
he
had
killed
ito
in
defending
his
mistress
honour
and
the
court
let
him
off
with
a
year
hard
labour
but
the
great
fujinami
bribery
case
which
developed
out
of
the
murder
trial
ruined
a
cabinet
minister
a
local
governor
and
a
host
of
minor
officials
it
reacted
on
the
yoshiwara
regulations
the
notoriety
of
the
case
has
gone
far
towards
putting
an
end
to
public
processions
of
and
to
the
display
of
prostitutes
in
the
windows
of
their
houses
indeed
it
is
probably
only
a
question
of
time
for
the
great
pleasure
quarters
to
be
closed
down
and
for
vice
to
be
driven
into
secrecy
fujinami
gentaro
was
sentenced
to
three
years
imprisonment
for
causing
bribes
to
be
distributed
meanwhile
countess
saito
had
been
in
correspondence
with
lady
everington
in
england
on
one
bright
march
morning
she
came
into
asako
room
with
a
small
flowerpot
in
her
hands
see
asa
chan
she
said
in
her
strange
hoarse
voice
the
first
flower
of
the
new
year
the
it
is
the
flower
of
hope
and
patience
it
blooms
when
the
snow
is
still
on
the
ground
and
before
it
has
any
green
leaves
to
protect
it
it
smells
sweet
said
asako
her
hostess
quoted
the
famous
poem
of
the
exiled
japanese
statesman
sukawara
no
michizané
when
the
east
wind
blows
send
your
perfume
to
me
flower
of
the
plum
even
if
your
master
is
absent
do
not
forget
the
spring
asako
dear
countess
saito
continued
would
you
like
to
go
to
england
asako
heart
leaped
oh
yes
she
answered
gladly
her
hostess
sighed
reproachfully
she
had
tried
to
make
life
so
agreeable
for
her
little
visitor
yet
from
the
tone
of
her
voice
it
was
clear
that
japan
would
never
be
home
for
her
marchioness
saméjima
and
i
continued
the
japanese
lady
have
been
arranging
for
a
party
of
about
red
cross
nurses
to
visit
england
and
france
they
are
all
very
good
clever
girls
from
noble
families
we
wish
to
show
sympathy
of
japan
for
the
poor
soldiers
who
are
suffering
so
much
and
we
wish
to
teach
our
girls
true
facts
about
war
and
how
to
manage
a
hospital
in
we
thought
you
might
like
to
go
as
guide
and
interpreter
it
needed
no
words
to
show
how
joyfully
asako
accepted
this
proposal
besides
she
had
heard
from
geoffrey
a
letter
had
arrived
thanking
her
for
her
christmas
gift
little
darling
asako
her
husband
had
written
it
was
so
sweet
of
you
and
so
like
you
to
think
of
me
at
christmas
time
i
hope
that
you
are
very
happy
and
having
a
jolly
good
time
it
is
very
rotten
in
england
just
now
with
the
war
going
on
it
had
broken
out
before
i
reached
home
and
i
joined
up
at
once
with
my
old
regiment
we
have
had
a
very
lively
time
about
half
of
my
brother
officers
have
been
killed
and
i
am
a
colonel
now
also
incidentally
i
have
become
lord
brandan
my
father
died
at
the
end
of
last
year
poor
old
father
this
war
is
a
ghastly
business
but
we
have
got
them
beat
now
i
shall
be
sorry
in
a
way
when
it
is
over
for
it
gives
me
plenty
to
do
and
to
think
about
reggie
forsyth
is
with
his
regiment
in
egypt
lady
everington
is
writing
to
you
i
am
in
the
north
of
france
and
doing
quite
a
lot
of
is
there
any
chance
of
your
coming
to
england
god
bless
you
asako
darling
write
to
me
soon
your
loving
geoffrey
with
this
letter
folded
near
her
heart
asako
was
hardly
in
a
mood
to
admire
it
was
with
difficulty
that
she
could
summon
sufficient
attention
for
give
the
little
saito
children
their
daily
lessons
in
english
and
french
long
rides
in
the
through
the
reviving
to
the
splendid
gorge
of
miyanoshita
or
to
the
beaches
of
oiso
where
count
saito
had
his
summer
villa
long
days
of
play
with
the
children
in
the
hanging
garden
the
fascinating
companionship
of
the
dwarf
trees
and
the
black
spaniels
and
the
welcome
absence
of
espionage
and
innuendo
had
soon
restored
asako
to
health
again
little
asa
chan
count
saito
said
one
day
beckoning
his
guest
to
sit
down
beside
him
in
the
sunlight
on
the
terrace
you
will
be
happy
to
go
back
to
england
oh
yes
said
the
girl
it
is
a
fine
country
a
noble
country
and
you
will
be
happy
to
see
your
husband
again
asako
blushed
and
held
down
her
head
i
do
think
he
is
still
my
husband
she
said
but
oh
i
do
want
to
see
him
so
i
think
he
wants
to
see
you
said
the
count
my
wife
has
received
a
letter
from
lady
everington
which
says
that
he
would
like
you
very
much
to
come
back
to
him
the
count
waited
for
this
joyful
news
to
produce
its
effect
and
then
he
added
asa
chan
you
are
going
to
be
a
great
english
lady
but
you
will
always
remain
a
japanese
in
england
you
will
be
a
kind
of
ambassador
for
japan
so
you
must
never
forget
your
father
country
and
you
must
never
say
bad
things
about
japan
even
if
you
have
suffered
here
then
the
english
people
will
like
you
and
for
that
reason
they
will
like
japan
too
and
the
two
counties
will
stand
side
by
side
as
they
ought
to
like
good
friends
the
english
are
a
very
great
people
the
greatest
of
all
but
they
know
very
little
about
us
in
the
east
they
think
that
because
we
are
yellow
people
therefore
we
are
inferior
to
them
perhaps
when
they
see
a
japanese
lady
as
one
of
their
wives
and
a
leader
in
society
they
will
understand
that
the
japanese
also
are
not
so
inferior
for
the
english
people
have
a
great
respect
for
peers
japan
is
proud
to
be
england
younger
brother
but
the
elder
brother
must
not
take
all
the
inheritance
he
must
be
content
to
share
for
perhaps
he
will
not
always
be
the
strong
one
this
war
will
make
england
weak
and
it
will
make
japan
strong
it
will
make
a
great
change
in
the
world
and
in
asia
most
of
all
already
the
people
of
asia
are
saying
why
should
these
white
men
rule
over
us
they
can
not
rule
themselves
they
fight
among
themselves
like
drunkards
their
time
is
over
and
past
then
when
the
white
rulers
are
pushed
out
of
asia
japan
will
become
very
strong
indeed
it
will
be
said
then
that
england
the
elder
brother
is
become
retired
from
active
life
and
that
japan
the
younger
brother
is
manager
of
the
family
i
think
you
will
live
to
see
these
things
asa
chan
certainly
your
children
will
see
them
i
could
never
like
japan
asako
said
honestly
the
old
diplomat
shrugged
his
shoulders
very
well
asa
chan
just
enjoy
life
and
be
happy
that
will
be
the
best
propaganda
