chapter
i
in
the
police
court
te
assistant
district
attorney
glanced
down
at
the
papers
in
his
hand
and
then
up
at
the
stockily
built
man
occupying
the
witness
stand
his
manner
was
conciliatory
according
to
your
testimony
clymer
the
prisoner
john
sylvester
was
honest
and
reliable
and
faithfully
performed
his
duties
as
confidential
clerk
he
stated
just
when
was
sylvester
in
your
employ
sylvester
was
never
in
my
employ
corrected
benjamin
augustus
clymer
the
president
of
the
metropolis
trust
company
was
noted
for
his
precision
of
speech
during
the
winter
of
i
shared
an
apartment
with
judge
james
hildebrand
who
employed
was
sylvester
addicted
to
drink
was
he
quarrelsome
was
sylvester
married
at
that
date
at
the
question
a
faint
smile
touched
the
corners
of
clymer
clean
shaven
mouth
and
his
eyes
traveled
involuntarily
toward
the
female
whose
charge
of
assault
and
battery
against
her
husband
had
brought
clymer
to
the
police
court
as
a
character
witness
in
sylvester
behalf
sylvester
left
judge
hildebrand
to
get
married
he
explained
he
was
a
model
clerk
honest
sober
and
that
is
all
the
assistant
district
attorney
spoke
in
some
haste
you
may
retire
sir
and
as
clymer
turned
to
vacate
the
witness
box
he
addressed
the
presiding
judge
clymer
did
not
catch
his
remarks
as
on
stepping
down
he
was
by
a
man
whose
entrance
had
occurred
a
few
minutes
before
through
the
swing
door
which
gave
exit
from
the
space
reserved
for
witnesses
and
lawyers
into
the
body
of
the
court
room
sit
over
here
a
second
the
newcomer
said
in
an
undertone
indicating
the
long
bench
under
the
window
has
miss
mcintyre
been
here
miss
mcintyre
here
clymer
stared
in
amazement
at
his
questioner
no
certainly
do
be
so
positive
retorted
the
lawyer
heatedly
his
color
rising
at
the
other
incredulous
tone
helen
mcintyre
telephoned
me
to
meet
her
and
by
jove
here
she
comes
as
a
slight
stir
at
the
back
of
the
court
room
caused
him
to
glance
in
that
direction
a
patrolman
cap
in
hand
was
in
the
lead
of
the
small
procession
which
filed
up
the
aisle
and
clymer
gazed
in
astonishment
at
helen
mcintyre
and
her
twin
sister
barbara
what
had
brought
them
at
that
hour
to
the
police
court
the
court
room
was
filled
with
men
both
white
and
black
while
a
dozen
or
more
slatternly
negro
women
were
seated
here
and
there
the
assistant
district
attorney
plea
for
a
postponement
of
the
sylvester
case
on
the
ground
of
the
absence
of
an
important
witness
and
the
granting
of
his
plea
was
entirely
lost
on
the
majority
of
those
in
the
court
room
their
attention
being
wholly
centered
on
helen
mcintyre
and
barbara
whose
bearing
and
clothes
spoke
of
a
fashionable
and
prosperous
world
to
which
nearly
all
present
were
utterly
foreign
barbara
sensitive
to
the
concentrated
regard
which
their
entrance
had
attracted
drew
closer
to
amos
stone
their
family
physician
who
had
accompanied
them
at
her
particular
request
except
for
sylvester
she
and
her
sister
were
the
only
white
women
in
the
room
before
they
could
take
the
seats
to
which
they
had
been
ushered
the
clerk
stentorian
tones
sent
the
girls
names
echoing
down
the
court
room
and
barbara
much
perturbed
found
herself
standing
with
helen
before
the
clerk
desk
there
was
a
moment
wait
and
the
deputy
marshal
who
had
motioned
to
one
of
the
prisoners
sitting
in
the
cage
to
step
outside
emphasized
his
order
with
a
muttered
imprecation
to
hurry
a
slouching
figure
finally
shambled
past
him
and
stopped
some
little
distance
from
the
group
in
front
of
the
judge
bench
announced
the
clerk
charge
brought
by
he
looked
up
at
the
two
girls
miss
helen
mcintyre
answered
one
of
the
twins
composedly
daughter
of
colonel
charles
mcintyre
of
this
charge
brought
by
miss
helen
mcintyre
continued
the
clerk
against
and
his
pointed
finger
indicated
the
seedy
looking
man
slouching
before
them
smith
said
the
latter
and
his
husky
voice
was
barely
audible
smith
repeated
the
clerk
first
name
john
was
the
answer
given
after
a
slight
pause
john
smith
you
are
charged
by
miss
helen
mcintyre
with
what
say
you
guilty
or
not
guilty
the
man
shifted
his
weight
from
one
foot
to
the
other
and
shot
an
uneasy
look
about
him
not
guilty
he
responded
at
that
instant
helen
caught
sight
of
benjamin
clymer
and
his
companion
philip
rochester
and
her
pale
cheeks
flushed
faintly
at
the
approach
he
had
time
but
for
a
hasty
handshake
before
the
clerk
administered
the
oath
to
the
prisoner
and
the
witnesses
in
the
case
rochester
walked
back
and
resumed
his
seat
by
clymer
propping
himself
in
the
corner
made
by
the
bench
and
the
cage
inside
of
which
sat
the
prisoners
he
opened
his
right
hand
and
unfolded
a
small
paper
he
read
the
brief
penciled
message
it
contained
not
once
but
a
dozen
times
folding
the
paper
into
minute
dimensions
he
tucked
it
carefully
inside
his
vest
pocket
and
glanced
sideways
at
clymer
the
banker
hardly
noticed
his
uneasy
movements
as
he
sat
regarding
helen
mcintyre
standing
in
the
witness
box
although
paler
than
usual
the
girl
manner
was
quiet
but
clymer
a
close
student
of
human
nature
decided
she
was
keeping
her
composure
by
will
power
alone
and
his
interest
grew
the
judge
from
the
bench
was
also
regarding
the
handsome
witness
and
the
burglar
with
close
attention
colonel
charles
mcintyre
a
wealthy
manufacturer
had
upon
his
retirement
from
active
business
made
the
national
capital
his
home
and
his
name
had
become
a
household
word
for
philanthropy
while
his
twin
daughters
were
both
popular
in
gay
younger
set
several
reporters
of
local
papers
attracted
by
the
mention
of
the
mcintyre
name
as
well
as
by
the
twins
appearance
watched
the
scene
with
keen
expectancy
eager
for
early
morning
as
the
assistant
district
attorney
rose
to
question
helen
mcintyre
the
judge
addressed
him
is
the
prisoner
represented
by
counsel
he
asked
for
reply
the
burglar
shook
his
head
rising
slowly
to
his
feet
philip
rochester
advanced
to
the
man
side
if
it
please
the
court
he
began
i
will
take
the
case
for
the
his
offer
received
a
quick
acceptance
from
the
bench
but
the
scowl
with
which
the
burglar
favored
him
was
not
pleasant
hitching
at
his
frayed
flannel
collar
the
man
partly
turned
his
back
on
the
lawyer
and
listened
with
a
heavy
frown
to
helen
quick
answers
to
the
questions
put
to
her
while
waiting
for
my
sister
to
return
from
a
dance
early
this
morning
she
stated
i
went
downstairs
into
the
library
and
as
i
entered
it
i
saw
a
man
slip
across
the
room
and
into
a
coat
closet
i
retained
enough
presence
of
mind
to
steal
across
to
the
closet
and
turn
the
key
in
the
door
then
i
ran
to
the
window
and
fortunately
saw
officer
standing
under
the
arc
light
across
the
street
i
called
him
and
he
arrested
the
her
simple
statement
evoked
a
nod
of
approval
from
the
assistant
district
attorney
and
rochester
frowned
as
he
waived
his
right
to
her
the
next
witness
was
officer
and
his
testimony
confirmed
helen
the
prisoner
was
standing
back
among
the
coats
in
the
closet
he
said
my
automatic
against
his
ribs
brought
him
did
you
search
your
prisoner
asked
rochester
as
he
took
the
witness
yes
sir
find
any
concealed
weapons
no
a
burglar
kit
no
did
the
prisoner
make
a
statement
after
his
arrest
no
sir
he
came
along
peaceably
enough
hardly
a
word
out
of
him
acknowledged
regretfully
he
enjoyed
a
reputation
on
the
force
as
a
scrapper
and
a
willing
prisoner
was
a
disappointment
to
his
naturally
pugnacious
disposition
did
you
search
the
house
sure
and
have
i
been
telling
you
i
did
answered
his
pride
in
his
achievement
in
arresting
a
burglar
in
so
fashionable
a
neighborhood
as
sheridan
circle
was
giving
place
to
resentment
at
rochester
manner
of
addressing
him
at
a
sign
from
the
lawyer
he
left
the
witness
stand
and
rochester
addressed
the
judge
i
ask
the
indulgence
of
the
court
for
more
time
he
commenced
that
i
may
consult
my
client
and
find
if
he
desires
to
call
the
court
finds
responded
the
judge
that
a
clear
case
of
has
been
proven
against
the
prisoner
by
reputable
witnesses
he
will
have
to
stand
for
the
first
time
the
prisoner
raised
his
eyes
from
contemplation
of
the
floor
i
demand
trial
by
jury
he
announced
it
is
your
right
acknowledged
the
judge
and
turned
to
consult
his
calendar
stepping
forward
the
deputy
marshal
laid
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
go
inside
he
directed
and
held
open
the
cage
door
which
immediately
swung
back
into
place
and
rochester
following
closely
at
the
prisoner
heels
halted
abruptly
a
fit
of
coughing
shook
the
burglar
and
he
paused
by
the
iron
railing
gasping
for
breath
water
he
pleaded
and
a
court
attendant
handed
a
cup
to
rochester
standing
just
outside
the
cage
and
he
passed
it
over
the
iron
railing
to
the
burglar
then
turning
on
his
heel
the
lawyer
rejoined
clymer
his
discontent
plainly
discernible
a
clear
case
against
your
client
remarked
clymer
reading
his
thoughts
do
take
the
affair
to
heart
man
you
did
your
best
under
rochester
shook
his
head
gloomily
i
might
have
jove
why
did
i
ask
for
bail
bail
the
banker
suppressed
a
chuckle
as
he
eyed
the
threadbare
suit
and
tattered
appearance
of
the
burglar
who
had
resumed
his
seat
in
the
prisoner
cage
who
would
have
stood
surety
for
that
scarecrow
i
would
rochester
spoke
with
some
vehemence
but
his
words
were
partly
drowned
by
the
violent
fit
of
coughing
which
again
shook
the
burglar
and
before
he
could
finish
his
sentence
helen
mcintyre
stood
at
his
elbow
she
bowed
gravely
to
clymer
who
rose
at
her
approach
and
laid
a
persuasive
hand
on
rochester
sleeve
will
you
come
with
us
she
asked
barbara
and
stone
are
ready
to
leave
the
doctor
wishes
to
as
she
spoke
she
looked
across
at
stone
who
stood
opposite
her
in
the
little
group
he
failed
to
catch
both
her
word
and
her
eye
his
gaze
passing
over
her
shoulder
was
riveted
on
the
burglar
something
is
wrong
he
announced
and
pushed
past
barbara
let
me
inside
the
cage
he
directed
as
the
deputy
marshal
kept
the
gate
closed
at
his
approach
your
prisoner
appears
one
glance
at
the
burglar
proved
the
truth
of
the
physician
statement
and
the
gate
was
hastily
opened
stone
bent
over
the
man
whose
spasmodic
breathing
could
be
heard
distinctly
through
the
court
room
then
his
gaze
shifted
to
the
other
occupants
of
the
cage
the
man
must
have
air
he
declared
your
aid
looking
up
his
eyes
met
clymer
and
the
latter
came
swiftly
into
the
cage
followed
by
rochester
and
the
deputy
marshal
slammed
the
door
shut
behind
them
step
out
this
way
he
said
as
clymer
aided
the
physician
in
lifting
the
burglar
and
he
led
them
into
the
whence
prisoners
were
taken
into
the
cage
stretching
his
burden
on
the
floor
stone
tore
open
the
man
shirt
and
felt
his
heart
while
clymer
spying
a
water
cooler
sped
across
the
room
and
returned
immediately
with
a
brimming
glass
here
water
he
said
but
stone
refused
the
proffered
glass
no
use
he
announced
the
man
is
dead
echoed
the
deputy
marshal
well
i
be
say
doctor
but
stone
had
darted
out
of
the
room
and
he
turned
to
clymer
if
it
was
doctor
stone
i
would
say
he
was
crazy
he
declared
tut
feel
the
man
heart
and
convince
yourself
suggested
clymer
tartly
and
the
deputy
marshal
dropping
on
one
knee
did
so
detecting
no
the
officer
passed
his
hand
over
the
dead
man
unshaven
chin
and
across
his
forehead
brushing
back
the
unkempt
hair
under
his
none
too
gentle
touch
the
wig
slipped
back
revealing
to
his
astonished
gaze
a
head
of
short
cropped
red
hair
clymer
who
had
followed
the
deputy
marshal
movements
with
interest
gave
a
shout
which
was
echoed
by
rochester
and
stone
who
returned
at
that
moment
good
god
gasped
clymer
shaken
out
of
his
accustomed
calm
jimmie
turnbull
the
deputy
marshal
eyed
the
startled
men
you
do
mean
he
stammered
and
paused
for
answer
stone
straightened
the
dead
man
and
removed
the
wig
james
turnbull
he
said
gravely
and
turning
addressed
rochester
who
had
dropped
down
on
the
nearest
chair
cashier
of
the
metropolis
trust
company
rochester
and
your
roommate
masquerading
as
a
chapter
ii
the
game
of
consequences
rochester
did
not
appear
to
hear
stone
words
with
eyes
half
starting
from
their
sockets
he
sat
staring
at
the
dead
man
completely
oblivious
of
the
others
presence
after
watching
him
for
a
moment
the
physician
turned
briskly
to
the
dazed
deputy
marshal
summon
the
coroner
he
directed
we
can
not
move
the
body
until
he
his
curt
tone
brought
the
official
wits
back
with
a
jump
and
he
made
for
the
exit
only
to
be
stopped
at
the
threshold
by
a
man
just
entering
the
room
at
the
word
coroner
rochester
raised
himself
from
his
bent
attitude
and
brushed
his
hand
across
his
eyes
no
need
for
a
coroner
to
diagnose
the
case
he
objected
poor
turnbull
always
said
he
would
go
off
like
stone
moved
nearer
like
that
he
questioned
pointing
to
the
still
figure
explain
yourself
rochester
did
turnbull
expect
to
die
here
in
this
manner
no
no
certainly
the
lawyer
moistened
his
dry
lips
but
when
a
man
has
angina
pectoris
he
knows
the
end
may
come
at
any
moment
and
in
any
place
turnbull
made
no
secret
of
suffering
from
that
rochester
turned
toward
clymer
you
knew
benjamin
clymer
who
had
been
gazing
alternately
at
the
dead
man
and
vaguely
about
the
room
looked
startled
at
the
abrupt
question
i
knew
turnbull
had
bad
attacks
of
the
heart
we
all
knew
it
at
the
bank
he
stated
but
i
understood
the
disease
had
responded
to
there
is
no
cure
for
angina
pectoris
declared
rochester
no
permanent
cure
amended
stone
and
would
have
added
more
but
rochester
stopped
him
now
that
you
know
turnbull
died
of
angina
pectoris
there
is
no
necessity
of
sending
for
the
coroner
rochester
spoke
in
haste
his
words
tumbling
over
each
other
i
will
go
at
once
and
communicate
with
an
but
before
he
could
rise
from
his
chair
the
man
who
had
conducted
a
whispered
conversation
with
the
deputy
marshal
advanced
toward
the
group
just
a
moment
gentlemen
he
said
and
turned
back
a
lapel
of
his
coat
and
displayed
a
metal
badge
i
am
ferguson
of
the
central
office
do
you
know
the
deceased
he
was
my
intimate
friend
announced
rochester
before
his
companions
could
reply
to
the
detective
question
which
was
addressed
to
all
mr
clymer
here
can
tell
you
that
jimmie
turnbull
cashier
of
his
bank
was
well
known
in
financial
and
social
how
came
he
here
in
this
fix
asked
ferguson
with
more
force
than
grammatic
clarity
a
sudden
heart
attack
angina
pectoris
you
know
replied
rochester
glibly
with
fatal
i
was
alluding
to
what
killed
him
ferguson
explained
but
why
was
the
cashier
of
the
metropolis
trust
company
he
looked
questioningly
at
clymer
whom
he
knew
quite
well
by
sight
and
a
social
decked
out
in
these
clothes
and
a
wig
too
leaning
down
the
better
to
examine
the
clothing
on
the
dead
man
he
had
just
been
held
for
the
grand
jury
on
a
charge
of
volunteered
the
deputy
marshal
i
reckon
that
brought
on
his
true
true
agreed
rochester
the
excitement
was
too
much
for
ejaculated
the
detective
dangerous
sport
for
a
man
suffering
with
angina
pectoris
aside
from
anything
else
who
preferred
charges
the
misses
mcintyre
answered
the
deputy
marshal
to
whom
the
question
was
addressed
like
to
interview
them
no
no
rochester
was
on
his
feet
instantly
there
is
no
necessity
to
bring
the
twins
out
here
it
too
tragic
tragic
echoed
ferguson
why
why
why
turnbull
was
arrested
in
their
house
rochester
was
commencing
to
stutter
he
was
their
friend
caught
burglarizing
heh
ferguson
eyes
glowed
the
case
already
whetted
his
remarkably
keen
inquisitorial
instinct
which
had
gained
him
place
and
certain
fame
in
the
washington
police
force
are
the
misses
mcintyre
still
in
the
building
they
were
in
the
court
room
just
before
we
brought
turnbull
body
here
responded
the
deputy
marshal
i
guess
they
are
still
waiting
eh
doctor
stone
thus
appealed
to
nodded
i
agree
with
rochester
he
said
and
the
gravity
of
his
manner
impressed
ferguson
it
is
better
for
me
to
break
the
news
of
turnbull
death
to
the
young
ladies
before
bringing
them
here
therefore
with
your
permission
ferguson
he
got
no
further
through
the
outer
entrance
of
the
room
came
helen
mcintyre
and
her
sister
barbara
conducted
by
the
same
bowing
patrolman
who
had
ushered
them
into
the
court
room
an
hour
before
my
god
too
late
stammered
rochester
under
his
breath
and
he
turned
in
desperation
to
benjamin
clymer
the
bank
president
state
of
mind
at
the
extraordinary
masquerade
and
sudden
death
of
his
popular
and
trusted
cashier
bordered
on
shocked
horror
which
had
made
him
a
passive
witness
of
the
rapidly
shifting
scene
rochester
clutched
his
arm
in
his
agitation
get
the
twins
out
of
here
do
something
man
do
you
know
that
turnbull
was
in
love
with
his
fervid
whisper
penetrated
further
than
he
realized
and
one
of
the
mcintyre
twins
looked
inquiringly
in
their
direction
clymer
more
startled
than
his
demeanor
indicated
wondered
if
she
had
overheard
rochester
ejaculations
but
whatever
action
the
banker
contemplated
in
response
to
the
lawyer
appeal
was
checked
by
a
scream
from
the
girl
on
his
right
with
ashen
face
and
trembling
finger
she
pointed
to
turnbull
body
which
suddenly
confronted
her
as
she
walked
forward
who
is
it
she
gasped
babs
tell
me
and
she
held
out
her
hand
imploringly
her
sister
stepped
to
her
side
and
bent
over
turnbull
when
she
looked
up
her
lips
alone
retained
their
color
hush
she
implored
giving
her
sister
a
slight
shake
hush
it
is
jimmie
turnbull
can
you
not
see
for
yourself
dear
it
seemed
doubtful
if
helen
heard
her
with
attention
wholly
centered
on
the
dead
man
she
swayed
on
her
feet
and
stone
thinking
she
was
about
to
fall
placed
a
supporting
arm
about
her
do
you
not
know
jimmie
asked
her
sister
do
stare
so
her
tone
was
pleading
perhaps
the
young
lady
has
some
difficulty
in
recognizing
turnbull
in
his
disguise
suggested
ferguson
who
stood
somewhat
in
the
background
but
closely
observing
the
scene
disguise
helen
raised
her
eyes
and
ferguson
hardened
as
he
had
become
to
tragic
scenes
felt
a
throb
of
pity
as
he
caught
the
agony
in
her
mute
appeal
yes
miss
he
said
awkwardly
the
burglar
you
caught
in
your
house
was
turnbull
in
barbara
mcintyre
released
her
grasp
of
her
sister
arm
and
collapsed
on
a
chair
stone
still
supporting
helen
felt
her
muscles
grow
taut
and
an
instant
later
she
stepped
back
from
his
side
and
stood
by
her
sister
as
the
two
girls
faced
the
circle
of
men
the
likeness
between
them
was
extraordinary
each
had
the
same
slight
graceful
figure
equal
height
and
feature
for
feature
coloring
matching
coloring
they
were
identical
their
gowns
even
were
cut
on
similar
lines
only
their
hats
varied
in
shape
and
color
do
i
understand
gentlemen
helen
began
and
her
voice
gained
steadiness
as
she
proceeded
that
the
burglar
whom
officer
and
i
caught
lurking
in
our
house
was
james
turnbull
he
was
answered
ferguson
and
stone
as
the
twins
looked
dumbly
at
him
confirmed
the
detective
statement
with
a
brief
the
silence
that
ensued
was
broken
by
barbara
rising
to
her
feet
jimmie
won
his
wager
she
announced
her
gaze
did
not
waver
before
the
concentrated
regard
of
the
men
facing
her
he
broke
into
our
house
but
oh
how
can
i
pay
my
debt
to
him
now
that
he
is
dead
hush
helen
laid
a
cautioning
hand
on
her
sister
arm
as
the
voice
gained
in
shrillness
the
shrillness
of
approaching
hysteria
i
am
all
right
barbara
waved
her
away
impatiently
what
caused
jimmie
death
angina
pectoris
declared
rochester
too
much
excitement
brought
on
a
fatal
barbara
nodded
dazedly
i
knew
he
had
heart
trouble
but
she
stepped
toward
turnbull
and
her
voice
quivered
with
feeling
do
leave
jimmie
lying
there
take
him
to
his
room
doctor
turning
entreatingly
to
stone
the
physician
looked
at
her
compassionately
i
will
just
as
soon
as
the
coroner
views
the
body
he
promised
but
come
away
now
babs
this
is
no
place
for
you
and
he
signed
to
the
deputy
marshal
to
open
the
door
as
he
walked
across
the
room
barbara
keeping
step
with
him
and
her
sister
following
in
their
wake
at
the
door
barbara
paused
and
looked
back
will
there
be
an
inquest
she
asked
that
for
the
coroner
to
decide
responded
ferguson
as
long
as
turnbull
entered
your
house
on
a
wager
and
died
from
an
attack
of
angina
pectoris
the
inquest
is
likely
to
be
a
mere
formality
ah
here
is
the
coroner
now
as
a
man
paused
in
the
doorway
helen
mcintyre
moved
back
from
the
door
to
make
room
for
coroner
penfield
having
had
occasion
to
attend
court
that
morning
he
was
passing
the
door
when
attracted
by
the
group
just
inside
the
room
courteously
acknowledging
helen
act
penfield
stepped
briskly
across
the
threshold
and
stopped
abruptly
on
catching
sight
of
the
lonely
figure
on
the
floor
wo
you
hold
an
autopsy
ferguson
asked
clymer
breaking
his
long
silence
no
sir
we
never
do
when
the
cause
of
death
is
apparent
the
detective
bowed
to
coroner
penfield
is
that
so
coroner
penfield
nodded
unless
the
condition
of
the
body
indicates
foul
play
or
the
relatives
specially
request
it
we
do
not
perform
autopsies
he
answered
what
has
happened
here
and
he
gazed
about
with
quickened
interest
mr
turnbull
who
masqueraded
as
a
burglar
on
a
wager
with
miss
mcintyre
died
suddenly
from
angina
pectoris
explained
the
deputy
marshal
just
a
case
of
death
from
natural
causes
broke
in
rochester
please
write
out
a
permit
for
me
to
remove
turnbull
body
helen
mcintyre
took
a
step
forward
her
eyes
twice
their
accustomed
size
shone
brightly
in
contrast
to
her
dead
white
face
carefully
avoiding
her
sister
glance
she
addressed
the
coroner
i
must
insist
she
began
and
stopped
to
control
her
voice
as
turnbull
fiancee
i
she
faltered
again
i
demand
that
an
autopsy
be
held
to
determine
the
cause
of
his
chapter
iii
the
room
with
the
seven
doors
brewster
regarded
her
surroundings
with
inward
satisfaction
it
would
have
taken
a
far
more
captious
critic
than
the
pretty
widow
to
find
fault
with
the
large
room
in
which
she
sat
the
handsome
carved
venetian
furniture
the
rich
hangings
and
valuable
paintings
on
the
walls
gave
evidence
of
colonel
mcintyre
artistic
taste
and
appreciation
of
the
beautiful
brewster
had
never
failed
during
her
visit
to
the
mcintyre
twins
to
examine
the
rare
curios
in
the
carved
cabinets
and
the
tapestries
on
the
walls
but
that
afternoon
with
one
eye
on
the
clock
and
the
other
on
her
embroidery
she
sat
waiting
in
growing
impatience
for
the
interruption
she
anticipated
the
hands
of
the
clock
had
passed
the
hour
of
five
before
the
buzz
of
a
distant
bell
brought
her
to
her
feet
hurrying
to
the
window
she
peeped
between
the
curtains
in
time
to
see
a
stylish
roadster
electric
glide
down
the
driveway
leading
from
the
mcintyre
residence
and
stop
at
the
curb
as
she
turned
to
go
back
to
her
chair
stone
was
ushered
into
the
library
by
the
footman
brewster
welcomed
her
cousin
with
frank
relief
i
have
waited
so
impatiently
for
you
she
confessed
making
room
for
him
to
sit
on
the
sofa
by
her
side
i
was
detained
stone
voice
was
not
three
imperative
telephone
calls
from
her
coming
at
a
moment
when
he
had
been
engaged
with
a
serious
case
in
his
office
had
provoked
him
do
you
wish
to
see
me
professionally
indeed
i
she
laughed
frankly
i
am
the
picture
of
stone
observing
her
fine
coloring
and
clear
eyes
silently
agreed
with
her
the
widow
made
a
charming
picture
in
her
modish
and
the
physician
watching
her
with
an
appraising
eye
acknowledged
the
beauty
which
had
captivated
all
washington
brewster
had
carried
her
honors
tactfully
a
fact
which
had
gained
her
popularity
even
among
the
dowagers
and
mothers
who
take
an
active
part
in
washington
social
season
then
margaret
what
do
you
wish
to
see
me
about
stone
asked
after
waiting
without
result
for
her
to
continue
speaking
she
laughed
softly
you
are
the
most
practical
of
men
she
said
it
would
not
have
been
so
difficult
to
find
a
companion
anxious
to
spend
the
whole
afternoon
with
me
for
my
sake
colonel
mcintyre
for
instance
he
teased
and
laughed
amusedly
at
her
heightened
color
have
a
care
margaret
mcintyre
flirtations
are
all
very
well
but
he
is
the
type
of
man
to
be
deadly
in
earnest
when
once
he
falls
in
thanks
for
your
warning
brewster
smiled
then
grew
serious
i
sent
for
you
to
ask
about
jimmie
turnbull
death
this
morning
barbara
told
me
you
accompanied
them
to
the
police
yes
why
were
you
with
the
girls
because
i
was
told
nothing
of
their
trip
to
the
police
court
until
they
had
returned
she
replied
how
horribly
tragic
the
whole
affair
is
and
a
shiver
she
could
not
suppress
crept
down
her
spine
it
is
agreed
stone
what
possessed
jimmie
turnbull
to
play
so
mad
a
trick
his
wager
with
stone
leaned
a
little
nearer
have
you
learned
the
nature
of
that
wager
he
asked
lowering
his
voice
no
babs
was
in
so
hysterical
a
condition
when
she
returned
from
the
police
court
that
she
gave
a
very
incoherent
account
of
the
whole
affair
and
she
has
kept
her
room
ever
since
luncheon
explained
brewster
stone
looked
puzzled
i
understood
that
jimmie
was
attentive
to
helen
mcintyre
and
not
to
barbara
he
said
but
upon
my
word
barbara
appeared
more
overcome
by
jimmie
death
than
brewster
did
not
reply
at
once
instead
she
glanced
carefully
around
the
room
was
generally
the
rallying
place
of
the
mcintyres
it
stretched
across
almost
the
entire
width
of
the
house
the
and
recessed
windows
gave
it
a
medieval
air
in
keeping
with
its
antique
furniture
and
the
seven
doors
opening
from
it
led
respectively
to
the
large
dining
room
beyond
a
morning
room
billiard
room
the
front
and
back
halls
and
the
italian
loggia
which
the
stretch
of
ground
between
the
mcintyre
residence
and
its
neighbor
on
the
north
apparently
she
and
stone
had
the
room
to
themselves
i
can
not
answer
your
question
with
positiveness
she
stated
frankly
jimmie
appeared
impartial
in
his
attentions
to
the
twins
when
he
with
barbara
he
was
with
helen
and
vice
stone
gazed
at
her
in
some
perplexity
are
you
aware
that
helen
stated
at
the
police
court
this
morning
that
she
was
turnbull
fiancee
what
brewster
actually
bounced
in
her
seat
you
you
astound
me
i
was
a
bit
surprised
myself
acknowledged
the
physician
i
thought
rochester
however
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
helen
not
only
announced
she
was
jimmie
fiancee
but
as
such
demanded
that
a
examination
be
held
to
determine
the
cause
of
his
brewster
pretty
color
faded
and
the
glance
she
turned
on
her
cousin
was
sharp
why
should
helen
suspect
foul
play
she
demanded
for
that
is
what
her
request
stone
pulled
his
beard
absentmindedly
ah
here
is
colonel
mcintyre
he
exclaimed
as
the
portieres
before
the
hall
door
parted
and
a
tall
man
strode
into
the
library
mcintyre
was
a
favorite
with
the
old
physician
and
he
welcomed
his
arrival
with
warmth
exchanging
a
word
of
greeting
with
brewster
mcintyre
drew
up
a
chair
and
dropped
into
it
i
called
at
your
office
doctor
he
said
went
there
at
once
on
learning
the
shocking
news
about
poor
turnbull
why
in
the
world
he
announce
who
he
was
when
my
daughter
had
him
arrested
as
a
burglar
he
must
have
realized
that
prolonged
excitement
was
bad
for
his
weak
brewster
who
had
settled
herself
more
comfortably
in
her
corner
of
the
sofa
on
mcintyre
arrival
answered
his
remark
i
only
knew
jimmie
superficially
she
said
but
he
had
one
distinguishing
trait
patent
to
all
his
inordinate
fondness
for
practical
jokes
probably
the
predicament
he
found
himself
in
was
highly
to
his
taste
until
his
heart
her
voice
slightly
raised
carried
across
the
room
and
reached
the
ears
of
a
tall
slender
girl
who
had
stood
hesitating
on
the
threshold
of
the
dining
worn
door
on
beholding
the
group
by
the
sofa
all
hesitation
vanished
however
as
the
meaning
of
brewster
remark
dawned
on
her
and
she
walked
over
to
the
sofa
you
are
very
unjust
margaret
she
stated
and
at
sound
of
her
low
triante
voice
mcintyre
whirled
around
and
frowned
slightly
jimmie
was
thinking
of
the
predicament
of
others
not
of
what
do
you
mean
helen
her
father
demanded
why
how
could
jimmie
reveal
his
identity
in
court
without
involving
us
she
asked
good
afternoon
doctor
recollecting
her
manners
and
her
attention
thus
diverted
she
missed
the
sudden
questioning
look
which
brewster
and
her
father
exchanged
no
she
continued
jimmie
sacrificed
himself
for
by
becoming
a
mcintyre
laughed
shortly
do
talk
arrant
nonsense
the
girl
flushed
at
his
tone
and
stone
an
interested
onlooker
marveled
at
the
fleeting
flash
of
disdain
which
lighted
her
dark
eyes
stone
interest
grew
the
mcintyre
family
had
always
been
particularly
congenial
and
the
devotion
of
colonel
mcintyre
left
a
widower
when
the
twins
were
in
short
frocks
to
his
daughters
had
been
commented
on
frequently
by
their
wide
circle
of
friends
in
washington
and
by
acquaintances
made
in
their
travels
abroad
colonel
mcintyre
had
married
when
quite
a
young
man
frugality
and
industry
and
a
brilliant
mind
had
reaped
their
reward
and
wiser
than
the
majority
of
americans
he
retired
early
from
business
and
devoted
himself
to
a
life
of
leisure
and
the
education
of
his
daughters
their
debut
the
previous
autumn
had
been
one
of
the
social
events
of
the
washington
season
and
the
instant
popularity
the
girls
had
attained
proved
a
source
of
pride
to
colonel
mcintyre
his
chief
pleasure
consisted
in
gratifying
their
every
whim
and
stone
knowing
the
family
as
he
did
wondered
at
the
faintly
discernible
air
of
constraint
in
the
girl
manner
usually
frank
to
a
sometimes
embarrassing
degree
she
appeared
to
some
disadvantage
as
she
sat
gazing
moodily
at
the
tips
of
her
pumps
stone
attention
shifted
to
colonel
mcintyre
and
lastly
to
the
pretty
widow
at
his
elbow
had
dame
rumor
spoken
truly
in
the
report
widely
circulated
that
the
colonel
had
fallen
a
victim
to
the
charms
of
margaret
brewster
his
guest
if
so
it
might
account
for
the
young
girl
manner
however
devoted
mcintyre
daughters
might
be
to
brewster
as
a
friend
and
companion
they
might
resent
having
so
young
a
woman
for
their
not
receiving
any
reply
to
his
remarks
mcintyre
was
about
to
address
his
daughter
again
when
she
spoke
jimmie
will
be
justified
she
declared
stoutly
has
the
coroner
held
the
autopsy
yet
stone
autopsy
mcintyre
spoke
with
sharp
abruptness
i
thought
it
was
clearly
established
that
jimmie
died
from
angina
pectoris
it
is
so
believed
responded
stone
his
mystification
was
growing
had
not
helen
informed
her
father
of
the
scene
which
had
transpired
at
the
police
court
and
of
her
request
to
the
coroner
i
understand
the
examination
will
be
made
this
afternoon
a
heavy
paper
knife
nicely
balanced
between
mcintyre
well
manicured
fingers
dropped
to
the
floor
as
a
step
sounded
behind
him
and
the
butler
grimes
stopped
by
his
side
mr
rochester
just
telephoned
that
his
partner
harry
kent
is
out
of
town
miss
bowing
to
the
silent
girl
grimes
always
contented
himself
with
addressing
his
young
ladies
by
the
simple
prefix
miss
and
never
added
their
given
names
because
as
he
expressed
it
them
twins
are
alike
as
two
peas
and
which
is
which
i
considering
himself
one
of
the
family
from
his
long
service
with
colonel
mcintyre
he
kept
a
watchful
eye
on
the
twins
but
their
pranks
in
childhood
had
often
exasperated
him
into
giving
notice
which
he
generally
found
it
convenient
to
forget
when
the
first
of
a
new
month
came
around
mr
kent
will
be
back
added
the
butler
as
silence
followed
the
delivery
of
his
message
mr
rochester
wishes
to
know
if
he
can
transact
any
business
for
please
thank
him
and
say
the
girl
color
rose
as
she
caught
her
father
disapproving
look
the
colonel
waited
until
the
butler
had
disappeared
before
addressing
her
why
did
you
send
for
harry
kent
he
questioned
you
know
i
do
not
approve
of
his
attentions
to
barbara
rochester
is
well
enough
speaking
of
rochester
brewster
saw
the
gathering
storm
clouds
in
the
girl
expressive
eyes
and
broke
hastily
into
the
conversation
i
see
by
the
paper
cousin
amos
she
turned
so
as
to
face
stone
that
rochester
declared
positively
that
jimmie
turnbull
died
from
angina
what
philip
opinion
worth
the
young
girl
smiled
disdainfully
philip
seems
to
think
that
having
shared
an
apartment
with
jimmie
gives
him
intimate
knowledge
of
jimmie
health
philip
is
not
a
medical
no
acknowledged
her
father
but
here
is
a
medical
man
who
was
on
the
spot
when
jimmie
died
what
your
opinion
stone
stone
suddenly
conscious
of
the
keen
attention
of
his
companions
spoke
slowly
as
was
his
wont
when
making
a
serious
statement
rochester
contention
that
jimmie
died
from
angina
pectoris
would
seem
borne
out
by
what
transpired
he
said
undoubtedly
jimmie
felt
an
attack
coming
on
and
used
the
customary
remedy
to
relieve
it
and
what
was
that
remedy
questioned
brewster
swiftly
amyl
stone
spoke
with
decision
i
could
detect
its
presence
by
the
fruity
pleasant
odor
which
always
accompanies
the
drug
ah
the
exclamation
slipped
from
brewster
is
the
drug
administered
in
water
no
it
is
inhaled
take
care
you
have
dropped
your
stone
pulled
himself
up
short
in
his
speech
and
bent
over
but
the
young
girl
was
too
quick
for
him
and
stooped
first
to
pick
up
her
handkerchief
as
she
raised
her
head
stone
caught
sight
of
the
tiny
mole
under
the
lobe
of
her
left
ear
it
was
the
one
mark
which
distinguished
barbara
from
her
twin
sister
colonel
mcintyre
had
addressed
his
daughter
as
helen
and
she
had
not
undeceived
him
why
the
perplexed
physician
gave
up
the
problem
the
drug
he
went
on
to
explain
amyl
nitrite
comes
in
pearl
capsules
and
is
crushed
in
a
handkerchief
and
the
fumes
brewster
leaned
forward
suddenly
would
that
cause
death
she
asked
stone
shook
his
head
in
denial
not
the
customary
dose
of
three
minims
he
answered
and
turning
found
that
barbara
had
stolen
from
the
room

stopped
to
chat
with
him
as
he
walked
down
the
corridor
to
his

it
was
fully
fifteen
minutes
before
he
turned
the
knob
of
the
door
bearing
the
firm

on
its
glass

as
he
stepped
inside
the
anteroom
which
separated
the
two

occupied

by

and
his

a

took
up
a
letter
mr

left
this
for

before
his

his

kent
deposited
his

one
of

in
deciphering

and
picked

mr

the
clerk
handed
him
a
folded
paper
and
kent
ran
his
eyes
down
the
sheet
from
the
sentence
to
whom
it
may
concern

the

at

the

vanished
did

of

yes

told
me
to
file
the

no

sylvester
handed
a
neatly
arranged
package
to
kent
these
indicating
several
letters
lying
open
on
his
desk
are
to
the
bring
them
to
me
in
half
an
hour
and
kent
walked
into
his
private
office
carefully
closing
the
door
behind
him
opening
his
he
took
out
his
brief
bag
and
laid
it
on
the
desk
in
front
of
him
together
with
the
package
of
letters
instead
of
opening
the
letters
immediately
he
tilted
back
in
his
chair
and
regarded
the
opposite
wall
in
deep
thought
philip
rochester
could
not
have
selected
a
worse
time
to
absent
himself
three
important
cases
were
on
the
calendar
for
immediate
trial
and
much
depended
on
the
firm
successful
handling
of
them
kent
swore
softly
under
his
breath
his
last
warning
to
rochester
that
he
would
dissolve
their
partnership
if
the
older
man
continued
to
neglect
his
practice
had
been
given
only
a
month
before
and
upon
kent
return
from
eight
months
service
in
the
judge
advocate
general
department
in
france
apparently
his
warning
had
fallen
on
deaf
ears
and
rochester
was
indulging
in
another
periodic
spree
for
so
kent
concluded
recalling
the
unsteady
penmanship
of
the
note
handed
to
him
by
the
new
clerk
john
sylvester
kent
was
still
frowning
at
the
opposite
wall
when
a
faint
knock
sounded
and
at
his
call
sylvester
entered
here
are
the
letters
received
this
morning
sir
and
copies
of
the
answers
to
yesterday
correspondence
which
rochester
dictated
before
leaving
sylvester
explained
as
he
placed
the
papers
on
kent
desk
if
you
will
them
i
will
mail
them
at
kent
went
through
the
letters
with
care
and
the
new
clerk
rose
in
his
estimation
as
he
read
the
excellent
dictation
of
the
clearly
typed
answers
these
will
do
admirably
he
announced
sit
down
and
i
will
reply
to
the
other
at
the
end
of
an
hour
sylvester
closed
his
stenographic
note
book
and
collected
the
correspondence
by
that
time
scattered
over
kent
desk
i
have
these
notes
ready
for
your
signature
before
lunch
he
said
as
he
picked
up
a
newspaper
from
the
floor
where
it
had
tumbled
during
kent
search
for
some
particular
letter
heads
i
brought
in
the
morning
paper
sir
thought
perhaps
you
had
not
seen
kent
swung
his
chair
nearer
the
window
and
opened
the
newspaper
he
had
purchased
a
copy
when
walking
through
union
station
on
his
arrival
but
had
left
it
in
the
cafeteria
where
he
had
snatched
a
cup
of
coffee
and
hot
rolls
before
hurrying
to
his
office
he
read
a
column
devoted
to
international
affairs
scanned
an
account
of
a
senatorial
wrangle
and
was
about
to
turn
to
the
second
page
whistling
cheerily
when
his
attention
was
arrested
by
the
headings
bank
cashier
dies
in
police
court
james
turnbull
mistaken
for
burglar

fatal
attack
of
angina

kent
whistle
stopped
abruptly
and
clutching
the
paper
in
both
hands
he
devoured
the
short
account
printed
under
the
scare
heads
while
masquerading
as
a
burglar
on
a
wager
james
turnbull
cashier
of
the
metropolis
trust
company
was
arrested
by
officer
at
an
early
hour
yesterday
morning
in
the
residence
of
colonel
charles
mcintyre
officer
conducted
his
prisoner
to
the
precinct
police
station
and
later
he
was
arraigned
in
the
police
court
the
misses
mcintyre
appeared
in
person
to
prefer
the
charges
against
the
supposed
burglar
who
on
being
sworn
gave
the
name
of
john
smith
philip
rochester
the
well
known
criminal
lawyer
was
assigned
by
the
court
to
defend
the
prisoner
upon
the
evidence
submitted
judge
mackall
held
the
prisoner
for
trial
by
the
grand
jury
it
was
just
after
the
judge
announcement
that
smith
then
sitting
in
the
prisoners
cage
was
seized
with
the
attack
of
angina
pectoris
which
ended
so
fatally
a
few
minutes
later
it
was
not
until
after
he
had
expired
that
those
rendering
him
medical
assistance
became
aware
that
he
was
james
turnbull
in
disguise
james
turnbull
was
a
native
of
washington
his
father
the
late
hon
josiah
turnbull
of
connecticut
having
made
this
city
his
permanent
home
in
the
early
turnbull
was
looked
upon
as
one
of
the
rising
young
men
in
banking
circles
he
was
also
prominent
socially
was
a
member
of
the
alibi
metropolitan
and
country
clubs
and
until
recently
was
active
in
all
forms
of
athletics
when
his
precluded
active
exercise
officer
who
was
greatly
shocked
by
the
fatal
termination
to
turnbull
rash
wager
stated
to
the
representatives
of
the
press
that
turnbull
gave
no
hint
of
his
identity
while
being
interrogated
at
the
precinct
station
friends
attribute
disinclination
to
reveal
himself
to
the
court
to
his
enjoyment
of
a
practical
joke
not
realizing
that
the
resultant
excitement
of
the
scene
would
react
on
his
weak
heart
mr
turnbull
is
survived
by
a
great
aunt
he
had
no
nearer
relatives
living
it
is
a
singular
coincidence
that
the
lawyer
appointed
by
the
court
to
defend
turnbull
was
his
intimate
friend
philip
rochester
who
made
his
home
with
the
kent
read
the
column
over
and
over
then
letting
the
paper
slip
to
the
floor
sat
back
in
his
chair
too
for
words
jimmie
turnbull
arrested
as
a
burglar
in
the
home
of
the
girl
he
loved
on
charges
preferred
by
her
and
defended
in
court
by
his
intimate
friend
both
of
whom
were
unaware
of
his
identity
kent
rumpled
his
fair
hair
until
it
stood
upright
and
jimmie
death
had
followed
almost
immediately
as
the
result
of
kent
eyes
grew
moist
he
had
been
very
fond
of
the
eccentric
lovable
bank
cashier
whose
knack
of
performing
many
a
kindly
act
unsolicited
had
endeared
him
to
friends
and
acquaintances
alike
kent
had
seen
much
of
him
after
his
return
from
france
for
jimmie
attention
to
helen
mcintyre
had
been
only
second
to
kent
devotion
to
the
latter
sister
barbara
the
two
men
had
one
bond
in
common
colonel
mcintyre
disliked
them
and
discouraged
their
calling
to
the
secret
fury
of
both
but
love
had
found
a
way
kent
eyes
kindled
at
the
recollection
of
wholly
tender
reception
of
his
ardent
pleading
turnbull
courtship
had
met
with
a
where
he
had
least
expected
it
philip
rochester
had
fallen
deeply
in
love
with
helen
and
encouraged
by
her
father
had
pressed
his
suit
with
ardor
frequent
quarrels
between
the
two
close
friends
had
been
the
outcome
and
jimmie
had
confided
to
kent
before
the
latter
left
on
the
business
trip
to
chicago
from
which
he
had
returned
that
morning
that
the
situation
had
become
intolerable
and
he
had
notified
rochester
that
he
would
no
longer
share
his
apartment
with
him
and
to
look
for
other
quarters
as
quickly
as
possible
so
buried
was
kent
in
his
thoughts
that
he
never
heard
knock
and
it
was
not
until
the
clerk
stood
at
his
elbow
that
he
awoke
from
his
absorption
a
lady
to
see
you
kent
he
announced
shall
i
show
her
in
certainly
her
name
she
gave
sylvester
paused
on
his
way
back
to
the
door
it
is
one
of
the
misses
good
lord
kent
was
on
his
feet
straightening
his
tie
and
brushing
his
rumpled
hair
here
wait
a
minute
clutching
a
whisk
broom
in
a
frantic
endeavor
to
remove
some
of
the
signs
of
travel
which
still
clung
to
him
but
he
had
only
opportunity
for
one
dab
at
his
left
shoulder
before
barbara
entered
the
office
all
else
forgotten
kent
tossed
down
the
whisk
broom
and
the
next
instant
he
had
clasped
her
hand
in
both
of
his
his
eyes
telling
more
eloquently
than
his
stumbling
words
his
joy
at
seeing
her
again
this
is
a
business
call
she
stated
demurely
on
you
and
her
lovely
eyes
held
a
glint
of
mischief
as
she
mentioned
kent
partner
then
her
expression
grew
serious
i
want
legal
i
am
afraid
you
will
have
to
put
up
with
me
kent
moved
his
chair
closer
to
the
one
she
had
selected
by
the
desk
rochester
is
out
of
what
barbara
sat
bolt
upright
where
where
he
gone
i
do
know
kent
pulled
rochester
letter
out
of
his
pocket
and
it
he
did
not
mention
where
he
was
barbara
stared
at
him
she
had
paled
when
did
philip
leave
last
night
i
kent
tipped
back
his
chair
and
pressed
a
buzzer
a
second
later
sylvester
appeared
in
the
doorway
did
rochester
tell
you
where
he
was
going
he
asked
the
clerk
no
sir
rochester
stated
that
you
had
his
address
i
kent
concealed
his
growing
surprise
did
he
leave
any
message
for
me
other
than
the
letter
no
sir
at
what
hour
did
he
leave
the
office
i
ca
say
sir
he
was
still
here
when
i
went
away
at
five
he
gave
me
a
key
to
the
office
so
that
i
could
get
in
this
kent
remained
silent
and
he
added
is
that
all
sir
yes
thanks
and
the
clerk
retired
as
the
door
closed
barbara
turned
to
kent
have
you
heard
about
jimmie
turnbull
her
voice
was
a
bit
breathless
as
she
put
the
question
but
kent
puzzling
over
his
partner
eccentric
conduct
hardly
noted
her
agitation
yes
i
saw
the
account
just
now
in
the
morning
paper
he
answered
a
shocking
affair
poor
turnbull
he
was
a
good
he
was
barbara
spoke
with
unaccustomed
vehemence
and
looking
at
her
kent
saw
that
her
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
impulsively
he
threw
his
arm
about
her
holding
her
close
my
heart
dearest
he
murmured
fondly
if
there
is
anything
anything
i
can
do
barbara
straightened
up
and
winked
away
the
tears
there
is
she
said
tersely
investigate
jimmie
kent
gazed
at
her
in
astonishment
please
explain
he
suggested
the
morning
paper
states
very
plainly
that
the
cause
of
death
was
an
attack
of
angina
yes
i
know
and
that
is
what
philip
rochester
contends
barbara
paused
and
glanced
about
the
office
they
had
the
room
to
themselves
helen
believes
kent
drew
back
what
do
you
mean
babs
he
demanded
just
that
barbara
spoke
wearily
and
kent
giving
her
close
attention
grew
aware
of
dark
shadows
under
her
eyes
which
told
plainly
of
a
sleepless
night
i
want
to
engage
you
as
our
counsel
to
help
helen
find
out
about
jimmie
find
out
what
asked
kent
his
bewilderment
increasing
do
you
mean
that
jimmie
death
was
not
the
result
of
a
dangerous
heart
disease
but
of
foul
play
barbara
nodded
her
head
vigorously
kent
sat
back
in
his
chair
and
regarded
her
in
silence
for
a
second
how
could
that
be
babs
in
an
open
police
court
with
dozens
of
spectators
all
about
he
asked
the
slightest
attempt
to
kill
him
would
have
been
frustrated
by
the
police
officials
remember
a
prisoner
especially
is
hedged
in
and
well
he
was
so
very
hedged
in
retorted
barbara
i
was
there
and
saw
how
closely
people
approached
did
you
observe
any
one
hand
him
anything
barbara
drawled
the
word
as
she
strove
to
visualize
the
scene
in
the
court
room
then
catching
kent
look
of
doubt
she
added
with
unmistakable
emphasis
helen
and
i
do
not
believe
that
jimmie
died
from
natural
causes
we
think
the
tragedy
should
be
her
soft
voice
deepened
i
must
know
the
truth
harry
dear
for
i
feel
that
perhaps
i
am
responsible
for
jimmie
you
kent
voice
rose
in
indignant
protest
absurd
no
it
is
if
it
had
not
been
for
my
wager
with
jimmie
he
never
would
have
entered
our
house
disguised
as
a
what
brought
about
the
wager
last
sunday
helen
was
boasting
of
her
two
new
police
dogs
which
philip
rochester
recently
gave
her
and
said
how
safe
she
felt
we
had
several
burglaries
in
our
neighborhood
barbara
explained
and
when
jimmie
scoffed
at
the
dogs
i
bet
him
that
he
could
not
break
into
the
house
without
the
dogs
arousing
the
household
i
never
once
thought
about
jimmie
heart
trouble
she
confessed
and
her
lips
quivered
i
feel
so
you
are
inconsistent
babs
chided
kent
gently
one
moment
you
reproach
yourself
for
being
the
cause
of
bringing
on
jimmie
heart
attack
and
the
next
you
declare
you
believe
he
died
through
foul
play
you
looking
at
her
tenderly
while
a
whimsical
smile
softened
his
stern
mouth
do
go
so
far
as
to
claim
you
murdered
him
do
you
of
course
i
did
barbara
spoke
with
indignant
emphasis
and
her
fingers
snapped
in
uncontrollable
nervousness
jimmie
was
very
dear
she
hesitated
to
us
neither
helen
nor
i
can
leave
a
stone
unturned
until
we
know
without
a
shadow
of
a
doubt
what
killed
that
is
easily
proven
declared
kent
an
autopsy
helen
asked
the
coroner
to
hold
kent
stared
the
twins
were
certainly
in
earnest
my
advice
to
you
is
to
wait
until
you
hear
the
result
of
the
from
coroner
penfield
he
said
gravely
until
we
know
definitely
what
killed
jimmie
speculation
is
barbara
rose
at
once
i
thought
you
would
be
more
sympathetic
she
remarked
and
her
voice
was
a
bit
unsteady
i
am
sorry
to
have
troubled
in
an
instant
kent
was
by
her
side
barbara
he
entreated
i
promise
solemnly
to
aid
you
in
every
possible
way
my
only
happiness
is
in
serving
you
his
voice
was
very
tender
i
slave
here
day
in
and
day
out
that
i
may
sometime
be
able
to
make
a
home
for
you
do
leave
me
in
i
was
not
angry
only
deeply
hurt
barbara
confessed
i
have
so
longed
to
see
you
i
i
needed
you
i
the
rest
was
lost
as
she
bowed
her
head
against
kent
broad
shoulder
and
his
impassioned
whispers
of
devotion
brought
solace
to
her
troubled
spirit
i
must
go
declared
barbara
ten
minutes
later
father
would
make
a
fearful
scene
if
he
knew
i
had
been
here
to
see
she
picked
up
her
preparatory
to
leaving
then
i
can
tell
helen
that
you
will
aid
us
kent
stopped
on
his
way
to
the
door
i
will
try
and
see
the
coroner
this
afternoon
in
the
meantime
babs
ca
you
tell
me
what
makes
you
suspect
that
jimmie
might
have
been
killed
i
have
nothing
tangible
to
go
on
she
admitted
only
a
instinct
kent
did
not
smile
instinct
he
repeated
thoughtfully
well
does
your
instinct
hazard
a
guess
as
to
the
weapon
the
opportunity
and
the
motive
for
such
a
crime
jimmie
turnbull
had
an
enemy
in
the
barbara
looked
at
him
oddly
suppose
you
find
the
answer
to
those
conundrums
she
suggested
do
come
to
the
elevator
margaret
brewster
may
see
you
with
me
and
she
would
tell
father
of
our
is
brewster
still
with
you
asked
kent
paying
no
attention
to
her
protests
as
he
accompanied
her
down
the
corridor
i
understood
she
planned
to
return
to
the
west
last
she
did
but
father
persuaded
her
to
prolong
her
visit
barbara
was
guilty
of
a
grimace
then
hailing
the
descending
elevator
she
bolted
into
it
and
waved
her
to
kent
as
the
cage
shot
downward
when
kent
reentered
his
office
he
found
sylvester
hanging
up
the
telephone
receiver
mr
clymer
has
telephoned
to
ask
if
you
will
come
to
the
metropolis
trust
company
at
once
he
said
and
before
kent
could
frame
a
reply
he
had
darted
into
the
coat
closet
and
brought
out
his
hat
and
cane
and
handed
them
to
him
do
wait
for
me
but
go
out
for
your
luncheon
directed
kent
observing
the
hour
i
have
my
key
and
can
get
in
when
i
return
if
you
should
not
be
here
and
not
waiting
to
hear
sylvester
thanks
he
hurried
away
the
clock
over
the
bank
had
just
struck
noon
when
kent
reached
the
fine
office
building
which
housed
the
metropolis
trust
company
and
as
he
entered
the
bank
a
messenger
stopped
him
mr
clymer
is
waiting
for
you
in
his
private
office
sir
he
said
and
led
the
way
past
the
long
rows
of
mahogany
counters
and
plate
glass
windows
to
the
back
of
the
bank
finally
stopping
before
a
door
bearing
the
name
in
modest
lettering
benjamin
augustus
clymer
the
bank
president
was
sensitive
on
one
point
he
never
permitted
initials
only
to
be
used
before
his
name
the
messenger
deferential
knock
was
answered
by
a
gruff
command
to
enter
clymer
welcomed
kent
with
an
air
of
relief
you
know
colonel
mcintyre
he
said
by
way
of
introduction
and
kent
became
aware
that
the
tall
man
lounging
with
his
back
to
him
in
one
of
the
leather
covered
chairs
was
barbara
father
colonel
mcintyre
returned
kent
bow
with
a
curt
nod
and
then
clymer
pushed
forward
a
chair
sit
down
kent
he
began
you
have
already
handled
several
confidential
affairs
for
the
bank
in
a
satisfactory
manner
and
i
have
sent
for
you
to
ask
your
aid
in
an
urgent
matter
before
i
go
further
i
must
ask
you
to
treat
what
i
am
about
to
say
as
strictly
certainly
good
then
draw
up
your
clymer
waited
until
kent
had
complied
with
his
request
you
have
heard
of
jimmie
turnbull
sudden
and
tragic
death
as
you
know
he
was
cashier
of
this
clymer
spoke
with
deliberation
soon
after
word
reached
here
of
his
death
the
and
treasurer
of
the
bank
had
a
careful
examination
made
of
his
books
and
clymer
paused
to
clear
his
throat
he
was
troubled
with
an
irritating
cough
turnbull
accounts
were
found
in
first
class
i
am
sure
they
would
be
clymer
exclaimed
kent
warmly
any
one
who
knew
jimmie
would
never
doubt
his
mcintyre
turned
in
his
chair
and
regarded
the
speaker
with
no
friendly
eye
but
aside
from
that
took
no
part
in
the
conversation
clymer
did
not
at
once
resume
speaking
he
commenced
finally
colonel
mcintyre
called
at
the
bank
and
asked
the
treasurer
gilmore
for
certain
valuable
negotiable
securities
which
he
left
in
the
bank
care
a
month
ago
gilmore
told
colonel
mcintyre
that
these
securities
had
been
given
to
jimmie
turnbull
last
saturday
on
his
presentation
of
a
letter
from
mcintyre
requesting
that
they
be
turned
over
to
the
bank
cashier
mcintyre
expressed
his
surprise
and
asked
to
see
the
letter
clymer
paused
and
took
a
paper
from
his
desk
here
is
the
kent
took
the
paper
and
examined
it
closely
this
is
perfectly
in
order
he
said
a
clear
statement
in
colonel
mcintyre
handwriting
and
on
his
for
the
first
time
colonel
mcintyre
addressed
him
the
letter
is
in
order
he
acknowledged
and
written
on
my
stationery
but
it
was
not
written
by
me
the
letter
is
a
clever
chapter
the
vanishing
man
it
still
lacked
twenty
minutes
of
nine
that
night
when
harry
kent
turned
into
the
saratoga
apartment
hotel
and
not
waiting
to
take
one
of
the
elevators
ran
up
the
staircase
to
the
apartment
which
had
been
occupied
jointly
by
jimmie
turnbull
and
philip
rochester
kent
had
already
selected
the
right
key
from
among
those
on
the
bunch
he
had
found
in
rochester
desk
at
the
office
and
slipping
it
into
the
of
the
outer
door
he
turned
the
lock
and
walked
noiselessly
inside
the
dark
apartment
the
soft
click
of
the
outer
door
as
it
swung
to
was
hardly
noticeable
and
kent
pausing
only
long
enough
to
get
his
breath
from
his
run
up
the
staircase
stepped
into
the
living
room
and
reached
for
the
electric
light
switch
instead
of
encountering
the
cold
metal
of
the
switch
his
groping
fingers
closed
over
warm
flesh
startled
as
he
was
kent
retained
enough
presence
of
mind
to
grasp
the
hand
tightly
the
next
second
a
man
hurled
himself
upon
him
and
he
gave
back
furniture
in
the
path
of
the
struggling
men
was
overturned
as
they
fought
in
silent
desperation
kent
would
have
given
much
for
light
he
strained
his
eyes
to
see
his
adversary
but
the
pitch
darkness
concealed
all
but
the
vaguest
outline
as
kent
got
his
second
wind
confidence
in
his
strength
returned
and
he
redoubled
his
efforts
suddenly
his
hands
shifted
their
grip
and
he
swung
his
adversary
backward
pinning
him
against
the
wall
a
faint
sobbing
breath
escaped
the
man
and
kent
felt
the
whole
figure
against
which
he
pressed
quiver
and
relax
the
taut
muscles
of
chest
and
arms
grew
slack
collapsed
kent
stood
in
wonderment
peering
ahead
his
hands
empty
the
man
had
vanished
drawing
a
long
long
breath
kent
felt
his
way
back
to
the
electric
switch
and
pressed
the
button
lighting
both
the
wall
brackets
and
the
table
lamps
with
both
hands
on
his
throbbing
temples
he
gazed
at
the
chairs
they
as
well
as
his
aching
throat
testified
to
his
encounter
having
been
a
reality
and
not
a
fantastic
dream
his
glance
traveled
this
way
and
that
about
the
room
and
rested
longest
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
where
he
had
pinned
the
man
to
the
wall
wall
kent
leaned
against
a
tall
highboy
and
laughed
weakly
immoderately
he
had
pushed
the
man
straight
against
the
door
leading
into
rochester
bedroom
and
not
as
he
had
supposed
against
the
solid
wall
the
man
had
been
enough
to
grasp
the
situation
his
pretended
weakness
had
caused
kent
to
relax
his
hold
a
turn
of
the
knob
of
the
door
which
swung
inward
and
he
had
made
his
escape
into
the
bedroom
leaving
kent
staring
into
dark
empty
space
gathering
his
wits
together
kent
hurried
into
the
bedroom
it
was
empty
so
also
was
the
bathroom
opening
from
it
from
there
kent
made
the
rounds
of
the
apartment
switching
on
the
light
until
the
place
was
ablaze
but
in
spite
of
his
minute
search
of
closets
and
under
beds
and
behind
furniture
he
could
find
no
trace
of
his
late
adversary
kent
stopped
long
enough
in
the
pantry
to
refresh
himself
with
a
glass
of
water
then
he
returned
to
the
living
room
and
sat
down
in
an
arm
chair
by
the
window
he
wanted
time
to
think
how
had
the
man
vanished
so
utterly
leaving
no
trace
behind
in
the
apartment
the
window
in
rochester
room
was
locked
on
the
inside
in
fact
all
the
apartment
windows
were
securely
fastened
he
had
found
on
his
tour
of
inspection
the
only
one
not
locked
was
the
oval
swinging
window
high
up
in
the
side
wall
of
the
bathroom
only
a
child
could
squeeze
through
it
kent
decided
the
window
looked
into
a
well
formed
by
the
wings
of
the
apartment
house
and
had
a
sheer
drop
of
fifty
feet
to
the
ground
below
but
for
his
unfortunate
luck
in
backing
the
man
against
the
bedroom
door
instead
of
the
wall
he
would
not
have
escaped
but
how
had
the
man
realized
so
instantly
that
he
was
against
a
door
in
the
pitch
darkness
it
certainly
showed
familiarity
with
his
surroundings
kent
sat
upright
as
an
idea
flashed
through
his
brain
was
the
man
philip
rochester
kent
scouted
the
idea
but
it
persisted
suppose
it
had
been
philip
rochester
awakened
from
a
drunken
slumber
by
his
entrance
in
the
dark
if
so
nothing
more
likely
than
that
he
had
mistaken
him
kent
for
a
burglar
and
sprung
at
him
but
why
had
he
disappeared
without
revealing
his
identity
to
kent
surely
the
same
reason
worked
both
ways
the
man
who
had
wrestled
with
him
was
as
unaware
of
kent
identity
as
kent
was
of
his
they
had
fought
in
the
dark
and
in
silence
kent
laughed
aloud
the
situation
had
its
amusing
side
then
as
recollection
came
of
the
scene
in
the
bank
that
morning
his
mirth
changed
to
grim
seriousness
at
his
earnest
solicitation
and
backed
by
benjamin
clymer
endorsement
of
his
plan
colonel
mcintyre
had
agreed
to
give
him
until
saturday
night
to
locate
the
missing
securities
if
he
failed
then
the
colonel
proposed
placing
the
affair
in
the
hands
of
the
authorities
kent
firm
mouth
settled
into
dogged
lines
at
the
thought
such
a
procedure
meant
besmirching
jimmie
turnbull
name
let
the
public
get
the
slightest
inkling
that
the
bank
cashier
was
suspected
of
forgery
and
there
would
be
the
devil
to
pay
kent
was
determined
to
protect
the
honor
of
his
dead
friend
and
to
aid
helen
mcintyre
in
her
investigation
of
his
sudden
death
jimmie
turnbull
had
been
the
soul
of
honor
that
he
had
ever
stooped
to
forgery
was
unbelievable
there
was
some
explanation
favorable
to
him
there
must
be
kent
clenched
fist
struck
the
arm
of
his
chair
a
vigorous
blow
and
he
leapt
to
his
feet
wasting
no
further
time
on
speculation
he
commenced
a
systematic
search
of
the
apartment
replacing
each
chair
and
table
as
well
as
the
rugs
which
had
been
in
his
recent
tussle
after
which
he
tried
the
drawers
of
jimmie
desk
they
were
unlocked
a
careful
search
brought
nothing
to
light
but
receipted
bills
some
loose
change
old
dinner
cards
theater
programs
tea
invitations
and
several
packages
of
cigarettes
turning
from
the
desk
kent
walked
over
to
the
table
which
he
knew
was
philip
rochester
property
he
recalled
having
once
seen
jimmie
place
some
papers
there
by
mistake
having
done
so
once
the
mistake
might
have
occurred
again
taking
out
his
partner
bunch
of
keys
he
soon
found
one
that
fitted
and
opened
the
drawers
he
had
half
completed
his
task
without
finding
any
clew
to
the
missing
securities
when
he
was
interrupted
by
the
sound
of
the
opening
of
the
front
door
and
had
but
time
to
slam
the
drawers
shut
and
pocket
the
keys
when
the
night
clerk
of
the
hotel
stepped
inside
the
apartment
and
closely
followed
by
a
man
walked
into
the
living
room
he
halted
abruptly
at
sight
of
kent
good
evening
kent
he
exclaimed
and
took
in
at
a
glance
the
orderly
arrangement
of
the
room
pardon
my
unceremonious
entrance
but
i
had
no
idea
you
were
here
sir
we
received
a
telephone
message
that
a
burglar
had
broken
in
you
did
kent
stared
at
him
was
he
right
after
all
in
his
conjecture
had
the
man
been
philip
rochester
it
would
seem
so
for
who
else
after
taking
refuge
elsewhere
would
have
telephoned
a
warning
of
burglars
to
the
hotel
office
have
you
any
idea
who
sent
the
message
stuart
i
have
not
it
was
an
call
stuart
turned
to
his
companion
sorry
i
brought
you
here
on
an
idiotic
chase
that
all
right
responded
the
detective
good
naturedly
would
you
like
me
to
look
through
the
apartment
just
to
see
if
any
one
really
is
concealed
on
the
premises
kent
he
asked
and
added
quickly
seeing
kent
hesitate
i
am
from
the
central
office
stuart
can
vouch
for
kent
hesitation
vanished
i
be
obliged
if
you
would
as
he
spoke
he
led
the
way
to
rochester
bedroom
come
with
us
stuart
as
the
clerk
loitered
behind
guess
not
sir
i
needed
down
at
the
desk
we
are
let
me
know
how
the
hunt
turns
out
and
he
stepped
into
the
vestibule
good
good
night
called
kent
and
he
accompanied
ferguson
as
far
as
the
bathroom
door
then
returned
to
his
inspection
of
rochester
table
he
had
just
completed
his
task
when
the
detective
rejoined
him
no
trace
of
any
one
the
latter
announced
some
one
put
up
a
joke
on
stuart
i
imagine
find
what
you
wished
sir
kent
was
distinctly
annoyed
by
the
question
yes
he
replied
shortly
ferguson
ignored
his
curt
tone
will
you
spare
me
a
few
minutes
of
your
time
kent
he
asked
persuasively
i
wo
detain
you
kent
moved
over
to
the
chair
in
the
window
which
he
had
occupied
before
and
pointed
to
another
equally
as
comfortable
what
can
i
do
for
you
he
asked
as
ferguson
dropped
back
and
stretched
himself
in
the
soft
depths
of
the
big
chair
supply
some
information
answered
the
detective
promptly
just
a
minute
as
kent
started
to
interrupt
you
do
recall
me
but
i
met
you
while
working
on
the
chase
case
you
handled
that
trial
in
great
shape
ferguson
looked
admiringly
at
his
companion
lots
of
the
praise
went
to
your
partner
rochester
but
i
know
you
did
the
work
now
please
let
me
finish
holding
up
a
protesting
hand
i
know
carried
rochester
in
your
firm
he
dead
kent
was
silent
what
the
detective
said
was
only
too
true
rochester
realizing
the
talent
and
industry
which
characterized
his
younger
partner
had
withdrawn
more
and
more
from
active
practice
and
had
devoted
himself
to
the
social
life
of
the
national
capital
this
is
rather
a
way
of
reaching
my
point
finished
the
detective
but
kent
i
want
your
assistance
in
a
puzzling
go
on
i
as
he
spoke
kent
drew
out
his
cigar
case
and
handed
it
to
ferguson
the
matches
are
on
the
smoking
stand
at
your
elbow
now
what
is
it
ferguson
his
companion
did
not
reply
at
once
instead
he
puffed
at
his
cigar
did
you
read
in
the
paper
about
turnbull
death
he
asked
when
the
cigar
was
drawing
to
his
satisfaction
and
as
kent
nodded
a
silent
affirmative
in
answer
to
his
question
he
asked
another
did
you
know
him
well
did
he
have
an
enemy
not
to
my
kent
was
watching
the
detective
narrowly
what
was
he
driving
at
on
the
contrary
turnbull
was
extremely
with
colonel
mcintyre
ferguson
had
hoped
to
surprise
kent
with
the
question
but
his
companion
expression
did
not
alter
perhaps
he
was
not
with
the
colonel
he
admitted
slowly
what
prompts
the
question
ferguson
the
detective
hitched
his
chair
nearer
i
going
to
lay
all
my
cards
on
the
table
he
announced
i
need
advice
and
you
are
the
man
to
give
it
to
me
listen
kent
this
jimmie
turnbull
masquerades
as
a
burglar
night
before
last
at
the
mcintyre
house
is
arrested
a
charge
brought
against
him
for
by
miss
helen
mcintyre
and
shortly
after
he
dies
from
angina
pectoris
finished
kent
as
the
detective
paused
so
rochester
contended
admitted
ferguson
we
let
that
go
for
a
minute
now
when
miss
mcintyre
saw
turnbull
body
she
demanded
an
autopsy
why
to
discover
the
cause
of
death
answered
kent
quietly
that
is
obvious
sure
and
why
did
she
wish
to
discover
it
he
waited
a
brief
instant
then
answered
his
own
question
because
miss
mcintyre
did
not
agree
with
rochester
that
turnbull
had
died
from
angina
pectoris
that
is
obvious
too
now
what
made
her
think
that
i
am
sure
i
do
know
kent
air
of
candor
was
unmistakable
and
ferguson
showed
his
disappointment
has
miss
mcintyre
been
to
see
you
no
was
kent
truthful
answer
barbara
was
the
younger
twin
and
her
sister
was
therefore
miss
you
must
recollect
ferguson
he
added
that
had
miss
mcintyre
called
to
see
me
about
poor
turnbull
i
would
not
have
discussed
the
interview
with
any
one
under
any
certainly
i
am
not
asking
you
to
break
any
confidences
in
fact
ferguson
smiled
i
must
ask
you
to
consider
our
conversation
confidential
now
kent
does
it
not
strike
you
as
odd
that
apparently
the
only
man
in
washington
who
really
disliked
turnbull
was
colonel
mcintyre
and
it
is
his
daughter
who
intimates
that
death
was
not
due
to
natural
causes
oh
pshaw
kent
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
are
taking
an
exaggerated
view
of
the
affair
colonel
mcintyre
is
an
honorable
upright
american
and
turnbull
was
the
people
speak
highly
of
both
men
acknowledged
the
detective
i
saw
clymer
president
of
turnbull
bank
this
afternoon
and
he
paid
a
fine
tribute
to
his
dead
kent
drew
an
inward
sigh
of
relief
benjamin
clymer
had
proved
true
blue
he
had
not
permitted
colonel
mcintyre
desire
for
immediate
publicity
and
belief
in
turnbull
guilt
to
shake
his
faith
in
his
friend
you
see
ferguson
there
is
no
motive
for
such
a
crime
as
you
suggest
he
remarked
oh
for
the
motive
ferguson
rubbed
his
hands
nervously
together
as
he
shot
a
look
at
his
questioner
the
latter
features
and
manly
bearing
inspired
confidence
we
know
of
no
motive
he
corrected
and
we
know
of
no
crime
having
been
perpetrated
rapped
out
kent
come
man
do
hunt
a
mare
ah
but
it
is
a
mare
nest
ferguson
remarked
dryly
kent
bent
eagerly
forward
you
have
heard
from
the
coroner
not
yet
ferguson
jerked
forward
his
chair
until
his
knees
touched
kent
had
either
man
looked
toward
the
window
near
which
they
were
sitting
he
would
have
seen
a
black
shadow
squatting
on
the
window
ledge
as
kent
leaned
over
to
relight
his
cigar
the
face
at
the
window
vanished
to
cautiously
reappear
a
second
later
the
case
piqued
my
interest
continued
the
detective
after
a
pause
and
i
made
an
investigation
on
my
own
hook
after
the
departure
of
the
mcintyre
twins
and
coroner
penfield
i
went
back
to
the
court
room
and
poked
around
the
prisoners
cage
there
i
found
he
took
out
of
his
pocket
a
small
bundle
and
carefully
unwrapped
the
cover
a
handkerchief
questioned
kent
as
the
detective
did
not
unfold
the
white
muslin
but
held
it
with
care
yes
one
of
the
prisoners
in
the
cage
told
me
turnbull
dropped
it
as
stone
and
the
deputy
marshal
carried
him
into
the
smell
anything
holding
up
the
handkerchief
kent
wrinkled
his
nose
and
sniffed
several
times
smells
like
ferguson
nodded
good
guess
i
noticed
the
odor
and
went
at
once
to
mclane
he
told
me
the
handkerchief
was
saturated
with
amyl
amyl
nitrite
repeated
kent
reflectively
it
is
given
for
angina
yes
well
in
this
case
it
was
the
remedy
and
not
the
disease
which
killed
turnbull
announced
ferguson
triumphantly
nonsense
ejaculated
kent
i
happen
to
know
that
the
capsules
contain
only
three
minims
i
once
heard
turnbull
say
true
but
turnbull
got
a
lethal
dose
all
right
and
he
thought
he
was
taking
only
the
regular
one
devilishly
ingenious
on
the
part
of
the
criminal
was
it
yes
have
you
detected
the
criminal
kent
put
the
question
with
unmoved
countenance
but
with
inward
foreboding
the
mysterious
manner
was
puzzling
not
yet
but
i
will
ferguson
hesitated
the
first
thing
was
to
establish
that
a
crime
had
really
been
kent
bent
down
and
sniffed
again
at
the
handkerchief
to
which
a
faint
fruity
aroma
still
clung
how
did
you
discover
that
he
asked
dr
mclane
and
i
took
the
handkerchief
to
a
laboratory
and
the
chemist
found
from
the
number
of
particles
of
capsules
in
the
handkerchief
that
at
least
two
capsules
or
double
the
usual
dose
had
been
crushed
by
turnbull
and
the
fumes
inhaled
by
him
with
fatal
hold
on
cautioned
kent
in
the
flurry
of
the
moment
turnbull
may
have
accidentally
put
two
capsules
in
the
handkerchief
meaning
only
to
use
mr
kent
the
detective
spoke
impressively
that
was
not
his
own
handkerchief
exclaimed
kent
then
are
you
sure
that
turnbull
used
it
yes
that
fact
is
established
by
reputable
witnesses
stone
clymer
and
the
deputy
marshal
ferguson
spoke
with
increasing
earnestness
that
is
a
woman
handkerchief
look
at
ferguson
laid
the
little
bundle
on
the
broad
arm
of
kent
chair
and
with
infinite
care
folded
back
the
edges
of
the
handkerchief
revealing
as
he
did
so
the
small
particles
of
capsules
still
clinging
to
the
linen
but
kent
hardly
observed
the
capsules
his
entire
attention
being
centered
on
one
corner
of
the
handkerchief
which
had
neatly
embroidered
on
it
the
letter
chapter
vi
straight
questions
and
crooked
answers
colonel
mcintyre
with
an
angry
gesture
threw
down
the
newspaper
he
had
been
reading
do
you
mean
to
say
helen
that
you
decline
to
go
to
the
supper
on
account
of
the
death
of
jimmie
he
asked
yes
mcintyre
flushed
a
dark
red
he
was
not
accustomed
to
scenes
with
either
of
his
daughters
and
here
was
helen
flouting
his
authority
and
barbara
backing
her
up
it
is
quite
time
this
pretense
is
dropped
he
remarked
stiffly
you
were
not
engaged
to
jimmie
wait
as
she
attempted
to
interrupt
him
you
told
me
the
night
of
the
burglary
that
he
was
nothing
to
you
i
was
mistaken
helen
voice
shook
she
was
very
near
to
tears
when
i
saw
jimmie
lying
there
dead
she
faltered
and
her
shoulders
drooped
forlornly
the
world
stopped
for
hysterical
nonsense
mcintyre
was
careful
to
avoid
barbara
eyes
her
indignant
snort
had
been
indicative
of
her
feelings
keep
to
your
room
helen
until
you
regain
some
common
sense
it
is
as
well
our
friends
should
not
see
you
in
your
present
frame
of
helen
regarded
her
father
under
lowered
lids
very
well
she
said
submissively
and
walked
toward
the
door
on
reaching
it
she
paused
and
spoke
over
her
shoulder
do
try
me
too
far
mcintyre
stared
for
a
full
minute
at
the
doorway
through
which
helen
took
her
departure
well
what
the
he
pulled
himself
up
short
in
the
middle
of
the
ejaculation
and
turned
to
barbara
go
and
get
dressed
he
directed
we
must
leave
here
in
twenty
i
am
not
going
she
announced
not
going
mcintyre
frowned
then
laughed
abruptly
now
do
tell
me
you
were
engaged
to
jimmie
turnbull
i
think
you
are
horrid
barbara
small
foot
came
down
with
a
vigorous
stamp
well
perhaps
i
am
her
father
admitted
rather
wearily
do
keep
us
waiting
babs
the
car
will
be
here
in
less
than
twenty
but
father
i
prefer
to
stay
at
and
i
prefer
to
have
you
accompany
us
retorted
mcintyre
come
barbara
we
can
not
be
discourteous
to
brewster
she
is
our
guest
and
this
supper
is
for
her
well
take
barbara
was
openly
rebellious
barbara
his
tone
caused
her
to
look
at
him
in
wonder
instead
of
the
stern
rebuke
she
expected
his
voice
was
almost
wheedling
i
can
not
very
well
take
brewster
to
a
cafe
at
this
hour
without
causing
oh
exclaimed
barbara
i
do
have
to
play
chaperon
for
you
two
every
one
knows
she
is
visiting
us
what
there
improper
in
your
taking
her
out
to
supper
why
regarding
him
critically
young
enough
to
be
your
daughter
go
to
your
room
there
was
nothing
wheedling
about
mcintyre
at
that
instant
he
was
thoroughly
incensed
as
barbara
sped
out
happy
in
having
gained
her
way
she
announced
as
a
parting
shot
if
you
can
be
nasty
to
helen
father
i
can
be
nasty
colonel
mcintyre
brought
his
fist
down
on
a
smoking
table
with
such
force
that
he
scattered
its
contents
over
the
floor
when
he
rose
from
picking
up
the
debris
he
found
brewster
at
his
elbow
can
i
help
she
asked
no
thanks
everything
is
back
in
he
pulled
forward
a
chair
for
her
if
agreeable
to
you
i
will
telephone
ben
clymer
that
we
will
stop
for
him
and
take
him
with
us
to
the
cafe
marks
or
would
you
prefer
some
other
man
oh
she
threw
her
evening
wrap
across
the
sofa
and
sat
down
are
the
girls
ready
they
they
are
indisposed
and
wo
be
able
to
go
what
both
girls
yes
both
firmly
not
however
meeting
her
eyes
had
i
better
stay
with
them
she
asked
have
you
telephoned
or
stone
there
is
no
necessity
for
giving
up
our
little
spree
he
declared
cheerily
the
girls
do
need
a
physician
they
with
meaning
need
a
mother
he
picked
up
her
coronation
scarf
from
the
floor
where
it
had
slipped
and
laid
it
across
her
bare
shoulders
the
action
was
almost
a
caress
she
made
a
lovely
picture
as
she
sat
in
the
carved
chair
in
her
chic
evening
gown
and
as
her
soft
dark
eyes
met
his
ardent
look
mcintyre
felt
the
hot
blood
surge
to
his
temples
and
with
quickened
pulse
he
went
to
the
telephone
stand
and
gave
central
a
number
back
in
her
chair
brewster
sat
thoughtfully
watching
him
she
had
been
an
unobserved
witness
of
the
scene
with
barbara
having
entered
the
library
in
time
to
hear
the
girl
last
remarks
it
was
not
the
first
inkling
that
she
had
had
of
their
disapproval
of
colonel
attentions
to
her
but
it
had
hurt
the
widow
had
become
acquainted
with
the
twins
when
traveling
in
europe
just
before
the
outbreak
of
the
world
war
and
had
made
the
hasty
trip
back
to
this
country
in
their
company
colonel
mcintyre
had
planned
to
bring
the
twins
then
at
school
in
paris
home
himself
but
business
had
kept
him
in
the
west
and
he
had
cabled
to
a
spinster
cousin
to
chaperon
them
on
the
trip
across
the
atlantic
ocean
nor
had
he
reached
new
york
in
time
to
see
them
disembark
and
thus
had
missed
meeting
brewster
then
in
her
first
year
of
widowhood
the
friendship
between
the
twins
and
brewster
had
been
kept
up
through
much
correspondence
and
the
widow
had
finally
promised
to
come
to
washington
for
their
debut
visiting
her
cousins
and
stone
the
meeting
had
but
cemented
the
friendship
between
them
and
at
the
twins
urgent
request
seconded
with
warmth
by
colonel
mcintyre
she
had
promised
to
spend
the
month
of
april
at
the
mcintyre
home
the
visit
was
nearly
over
brewster
sighed
faintly
there
were
two
courses
open
to
her
immediate
departure
or
to
continue
to
ignore
the
twins
strangely
antagonistic
behavior
the
first
course
did
not
suit
brewster
plans
barbara
who
had
left
the
library
through
one
of
its
seven
doors
had
failed
to
see
brewster
by
the
slightest
margin
she
was
intent
only
on
being
with
helen
the
affection
between
the
twins
was
very
close
but
while
their
facial
resemblance
was
remarkable
their
natures
were
totally
dissimilar
helen
the
elder
by
twenty
minutes
was
studious
shy
and
too
much
given
to
introspection
barbara
on
the
contrary
was
whimsical
and
practical
by
turns
with
a
great
capacity
for
enjoyment
the
twins
had
made
their
debut
jointly
on
their
eighteenth
birthday
and
while
both
were
popular
barbara
had
received
the
greater
amount
of
attention
barbara
into
the
suite
of
rooms
which
the
girls
occupied
over
the
library
expecting
to
find
helen
lying
on
the
lounge
instead
she
found
her
writing
busily
at
her
desk
she
tossed
down
her
pen
as
her
sister
entered
and
taking
up
a
blotter
carefully
laid
it
across
the
page
she
had
been
writing
thank
heaven
i
do
have
to
go
to
that
supper
party
barbara
announced
throwing
herself
full
length
on
the
lounge
so
father
gave
it
up
commented
helen
i
am
gave
up
nothing
retorted
her
sister
he
and
margaret
brewster
are
what
helen
was
on
her
feet
you
let
them
go
out
alone
together
they
ca
be
alone
if
they
are
together
answered
barbara
practically
do
be
silly
helen
did
not
answer
at
once
she
had
grown
singularly
pale
walking
over
to
the
window
she
glanced
into
the
street
the
car
has
come
she
exclaimed
and
consulted
her
wrist
watch
hurry
babs
you
have
just
time
to
dress
and
go
with
i
said
i
would
go
stuttered
barbara
completely
taken
by
surprise
no
matter
tell
father
you
have
changed
your
helen
held
out
her
hand
come
to
please
me
and
there
was
a
world
of
wistful
appeal
in
her
hazel
eyes
which
barbara
was
unable
to
resist
it
was
not
until
barbara
had
completed
her
hasty
toilet
and
a
frantic
dash
downstairs
in
time
to
spring
into
the
waiting
limousine
after
margaret
brewster
that
she
realized
she
had
put
on
one
of
evening
gowns
and
not
her
own
benjamin
clymer
was
standing
in
the
vestibule
of
the
saratoga
where
he
made
his
home
when
the
mcintyre
limousine
drew
up
and
he
did
not
keep
them
waiting
as
colonel
mcintyre
had
predicted
he
would
on
the
drive
to
clymer
apartment
house
the
clerk
gave
me
your
message
when
i
came
in
mcintyre
he
explained
as
the
car
drove
off
i
called
up
your
residence
and
grimes
said
you
were
on
the
way
barbara
tucked
away
in
her
corner
of
the
limousine
listened
to
brewster
animated
chatter
with
utter
lack
of
interest
she
wished
most
heartily
that
she
had
not
been
by
her
sister
and
had
remained
at
home
that
her
father
had
accepted
her
lame
explanation
and
her
presence
in
the
party
with
unaffected
pleasure
had
been
plain
brewster
after
a
quiet
inquiry
regarding
her
health
had
been
less
enthusiastic
in
her
welcome
barbara
was
just
stifling
a
yawn
when
the
limousine
stopped
at
the
entrance
to
the
cafe
marks
inside
the
cafe
all
was
light
and
gaiety
and
barbara
brightened
perceptibly
as
the
attentive
head
waiter
ushered
them
to
the
table
colonel
mcintyre
had
reserved
earlier
in
the
evening
it
a
novel
idea
turning
the
old
church
into
a
cafe
barbara
remarked
to
benjamin
clymer
a
sort
of
casting
bread
upon
the
waters
of
famished
washington
i
wonder
if
they
ever
turn
water
into
wine
no
such
luck
groaned
clymer
dismally
looking
with
distaste
at
the
sparkling
grape
juice
being
poured
into
the
erstwhile
champagne
goblet
by
his
plate
the
cafe
is
crowded
and
he
gazed
with
interest
about
the
room
colonel
mcintyre
who
had
loitered
behind
to
speak
to
several
friends
at
an
adjacent
table
took
the
unoccupied
seat
by
brewster
and
was
soon
in
animated
conversation
with
the
widow
and
clymer
barbara
her
healthy
appetite
asserting
itself
devoted
her
entire
attention
to
the
delicious
delicacies
placed
before
her
the
arrival
of
the
crowd
awoke
her
from
her
abstraction
and
she
accepted
clymer
invitation
to
dance
with
alacrity
when
they
returned
to
the
table
she
discovered
that
margaret
brewster
and
her
father
had
also
joined
the
dancers
barbara
watched
them
while
keeping
up
a
disjointed
conversation
with
clymer
whose
absentminded
remarks
finally
drew
barbara
attention
and
she
wondered
what
had
come
over
the
generally
entertaining
banker
it
was
on
the
tip
of
her
tongue
to
ask
him
the
reason
for
his
distrait
manner
when
her
thoughts
were
diverted
by
his
next
remark
your
father
and
brewster
make
a
fine
couple
he
said
colonel
mcintyre
is
the
most
distinguished
looking
man
in
the
cafe
and
brewster
is
a
regular
instead
of
replying
barbara
turned
in
her
seat
and
scanned
her
father
as
he
and
brewster
passed
them
in
the
dance
colonel
mcintyre
did
not
look
his
age
of
years
his
hair
prematurely
gray
had
a
most
attractive
wave
to
it
and
his
erect
and
finely
proportioned
figure
showed
to
advantage
in
his
dress
suit
barbara
heart
swelled
with
pride
her
dear
and
handsome
father
then
she
transferred
her
regard
to
margaret
brewster
she
had
been
such
a
satisfactory
friend
why
oh
why
did
she
wish
to
become
her
the
twins
with
the
unerring
instinct
of
womanhood
had
decided
ten
days
before
that
weller
warning
to
his
son
was
timely
brewster
was
a
most
dangerous
widow
how
is
your
sister
inquired
clymer
breaking
the
silence
which
had
lasted
nearly
five
minutes
he
was
never
quite
certain
which
twin
he
was
talking
to
and
generally
solved
the
problem
by
familiarizing
himself
with
their
mode
of
dress
the
plan
had
not
always
worked
as
the
twins
had
a
bewildering
habit
of
exchanging
clothes
to
the
enjoyment
of
barbara
mischief
loving
soul
and
the
mystification
of
their
numerous
admirers
she
is
rather
blue
and
depressed
answered
barbara
we
are
both
feeling
the
reaction
from
the
shock
of
jimmie
turnbull
tragic
death
you
must
forgive
me
if
i
am
a
bore
i
am
not
good
company
the
arrival
of
the
head
waiter
at
their
table
interrupted
reply
this
gentleman
desires
to
speak
to
you
a
moment
miss
mcintyre
he
said
and
indicated
a
young
man
in
a
sack
suit
standing
just
back
of
him
i
parker
of
the
post
the
reporter
introduced
himself
with
a
bow
which
included
clymer
may
i
sit
down
laying
his
hand
on
the
back
of
brewster
vacant
chair
surely
and
wo
you
have
an
ice
barbara
hospitable
instincts
were
aroused
here
waiter
no
thanks
i
have
time
protested
parker
slipping
into
the
chair
i
just
came
from
your
house
miss
mcintyre
the
butler
said
i
might
find
you
here
and
as
it
was
rather
important
i
took
the
liberty
of
introducing
myself
we
plan
to
run
a
story
featuring
the
dangers
of
masquerading
in
society
and
of
course
it
hinges
on
the
death
of
turnbull
i
sorry
he
apologized
as
he
saw
barbara
wince
i
realize
the
topic
is
one
to
make
you
feel
badly
but
i
promise
to
ask
only
few
his
smile
was
very
engaging
and
barbara
resentment
receded
somewhat
what
are
they
she
asked
did
you
recognize
turnbull
in
his
burglar
when
you
confronted
him
in
the
police
court
parker
drew
out
copy
paper
and
a
pencil
and
waited
for
her
reply
there
was
a
pause
i
did
not
recognize
turnbull
in
court
she
stated
finally
his
death
was
a
frightful
sure
it
was
to
everybody
agreed
parker
how
about
your
sister
miss
barbara
did
she
recognize
him
faintly
parker
showed
his
disappointment
he
was
not
eliciting
much
information
abruptly
he
turned
to
clymer
whose
prominent
position
in
the
financial
world
made
him
a
familiar
figure
to
all
washingtonians
were
you
present
in
the
police
court
on
tuesday
morning
also
parker
asked
yes
clymer
modified
the
curt
monosyllable
by
adding
i
helped
stone
carry
turnbull
out
of
the
prisoners
cage
and
into
the
and
did
you
recognize
your
cashier
demanded
parker
at
the
question
barbara
set
down
her
goblet
of
water
without
care
for
its
perishable
quality
and
looked
with
quick
intentness
at
the
banker
i
recognized
turnbull
when
his
wig
was
removed
answered
clymer
raising
his
head
in
time
to
catch
barbara
eyes
gazing
steadfastly
at
him
with
a
faint
flush
she
turned
her
attention
to
the
reporter
mr
turnbull
must
have
been
superfine
parker
remarked
just
one
more
question
can
you
tell
me
if
philip
rochester
recognized
his
when
he
was
defending
him
in
court
no
i
can
not
and
observing
parker
blank
expression
she
added
why
do
you
ask
rochester
because
i
ca
locate
him
he
seems
to
have
vanished
off
the
face
of
the
the
reporter
rose
you
ca
tell
me
where
he
gone
i
suppose
i
have
the
faintest
idea
answered
barbara
truthfully
i
was
at
his
office
this
she
stopped
abruptly
on
finding
that
brewster
was
standing
just
behind
her
had
the
widow
by
chance
overheard
her
remark
if
so
her
father
would
probably
learn
of
her
visit
to
the
office
of
rochester
and
kent
that
morning
do
i
understand
that
philip
rochester
is
out
of
town
inquired
brewster
why
i
had
an
appointment
with
him
he
gone
and
left
no
address
that
i
can
find
explained
parker
thank
you
miss
mcintyre
good
evening
and
the
busy
reporter
hurried
away
there
was
a
curious
expression
in
brewster
eyes
but
she
dropped
her
gaze
on
her
finger
bowl
too
quickly
for
clymer
to
analyze
its
meaning
what
can
have
taken
rochester
out
of
town
she
asked
the
question
was
not
addressed
to
any
one
in
particular
but
colonel
mcintyre
answered
it
as
he
did
most
of
the
widow
remarks
dry
washington
he
explained
it
is
the
first
trip
philip
has
made
to
baltimore
since
the
law
has
been
in
force
eh
clymer
no
and
it
wo
be
his
last
was
the
banker
response
what
the
matter
miss
mcintyre
as
barbara
pushed
back
her
chair
i
feel
a
little
faint
she
stammered
the
air
here
is
is
stifling
if
you
do
mind
father
i
take
the
car
and
drive
i
come
with
you
announced
brewster
rising
hurriedly
and
as
she
turned
solicitously
to
aid
barbara
she
caught
colonel
admiring
glance
and
his
whispered
thanks
outside
the
cafe
clymer
discovered
that
the
mcintyre
limousine
was
not
to
be
found
and
cautioning
barbara
and
the
widow
to
remain
where
they
were
he
went
back
into
the
cafe
in
search
of
colonel
mcintyre
who
had
stayed
behind
to
pay
his
bill
a
sudden
exodus
from
the
cafe
as
other
diners
came
out
to
get
their
cars
separated
barbara
from
brewster
just
as
the
former
caught
sight
of
her
father
limousine
coming
around
mcpherson
square
not
waiting
to
see
what
had
become
of
her
companion
barbara
started
up
the
sidewalk
intent
on
catching
their
chauffeur
attention
as
she
stood
by
the
curb
a
figure
brushed
by
her
and
a
paper
was
deftly
slipped
inside
her
hand
barbara
wheeled
about
abruptly
she
stood
alone
except
for
several
elaborately
dressed
women
and
their
companions
some
yards
away
who
were
indulging
in
noisy
talk
as
they
hurried
along
at
that
moment
the
mcintyre
limousine
stopped
at
the
curb
and
the
chauffeur
opened
the
door
take
me
home
harris
she
ordered
and
then
come
back
for
brewster
and
father
i
do
feel
well
very
good
miss
and
touching
his
cap
the
chauffeur
swung
his
car
up
fifteenth
street
the
limousine
had
turned
into
massachusetts
avenue
before
barbara
switched
on
the
electric
lamp
in
the
car
and
opened
the
note
so
mysteriously
given
to
her
she
read
feverishly
the
few
lines
it
contained
dear
helen
the
coroner
will
call
an
inquest
secrete
letter
the
note
was
unsigned
but
it
was
in
the
handwriting
of
philip
rochester
chapter
vii
the
red
seal
the
gloomy
morning
with
leaden
skies
and
intermittent
rain
reflected
harry
kent
state
of
mind
he
could
not
fix
his
attention
on
the
business
letters
which
sylvester
placed
before
him
instead
his
thoughts
reverted
to
the
scene
in
rochester
and
turnbull
apartment
the
night
before
the
elusive
visitor
he
had
found
there
on
his
arrival
his
interview
with
detective
ferguson
and
above
all
the
handkerchief
saturated
with
amyl
nitrite
and
bearing
the
small
embroidered
letter
b
the
initial
insignificant
in
size
but
fraught
with
dire
possibilities
if
as
ferguson
hinted
turnbull
had
been
put
to
death
by
an
of
the
drug
b
barbara
barbara
b
his
mind
rang
the
changes
pshaw
other
names
than
barbara
began
with
shall
i
transcribe
your
notes
kent
asked
sylvester
and
kent
awakened
from
his
reverie
discovered
that
he
had
scrawled
the
name
barbara
and
capital
bs
on
the
writing
pad
he
tore
off
the
sheet
and
crumpled
it
into
a
small
ball
no
my
notes
are
kent
unlocked
his
desk
and
took
some
manuscript
from
one
of
the
drawers
make
four
copies
of
this
brief
then
call
up
the
printer
and
ask
how
soon
he
will
complete
the
work
on
hand
has
clymer
telephoned
not
this
sylvester
rose
papers
in
hand
there
has
been
a
parker
of
the
post
who
telephones
regularly
once
an
hour
to
ask
for
rochester
address
and
when
he
is
expected
at
the
he
paused
and
looked
inquiringly
at
kent
what
shall
i
say
the
next
time
he
calls
switch
him
on
my
phone
briefly
that
is
all
now
sylvester
i
must
be
in
court
by
noon
so
have
the
brief
copied
by
yes
sir
and
sylvester
departed
only
to
return
a
second
later
miss
mcintyre
to
see
you
he
announced
and
stood
aside
to
allow
the
girl
to
enter
it
was
the
first
time
kent
had
seen
helen
since
the
tragedy
of
tuesday
and
as
he
advanced
to
greet
her
he
noted
with
concern
her
air
of
distress
and
the
troubled
look
in
her
eyes
her
composed
manner
was
obviously
only
maintained
by
the
exertion
of
for
the
hand
she
offered
him
was
unsteady
you
are
so
kind
she
murmured
as
he
placed
a
chair
for
her
babs
told
me
you
have
promised
your
aid
and
so
i
have
come
she
pressed
one
hand
to
her
side
as
if
she
found
breathing
difficult
and
kent
reaching
for
his
pitcher
of
ice
water
which
stood
near
at
hand
filled
a
tumbler
and
gave
it
to
her
take
a
little
he
coaxed
as
she
moved
as
if
to
refuse
the
glass
why
did
you
telephone
and
i
would
have
called
on
you
in
fact
i
planned
to
run
in
and
see
you
this
afternoon
it
is
wiser
to
have
our
talk
here
she
replied
setting
down
the
empty
glass
she
gazed
about
the
office
and
her
face
brightened
at
sight
of
a
safe
standing
in
one
corner
is
that
yours
or
philip
she
asked
pointing
to
it
the
safe
oh
it
for
our
joint
use
owned
by
the
firm
you
know
explained
kent
somewhat
puzzled
by
her
eagerness
do
you
keep
your
private
papers
there
as
well
as
the
firm
oh
yes
philip
has
retained
one
section
and
i
the
kent
walked
over
and
threw
open
the
massive
door
which
he
had
unlocked
on
entering
the
office
and
left
ajar
would
you
like
to
see
the
arrangements
of
the
compartments
without
answering
helen
crossed
the
room
and
stood
by
his
side
which
is
philip
section
she
asked
this
and
kent
touched
the
side
of
the
safe
helen
turned
around
and
inspected
the
office
the
outer
door
through
which
she
had
entered
was
closed
as
were
also
the
private
door
leading
directly
into
the
outside
corridor
and
the
one
opening
into
the
closet
convinced
that
they
were
really
alone
she
took
from
her
leather
a
white
envelope
and
handed
it
to
kent
please
put
this
in
philip
compartment
she
said
and
as
he
hesitated
she
added
pleadingly
please
do
it
harry
and
ask
no
kent
looked
at
her
wonderingly
the
girl
was
obviously
laboring
under
intense
excitement
of
some
sort
which
might
at
any
moment
break
into
hysteria
bottling
up
his
curiosity
he
stooped
down
in
front
of
the
safe
certainly
i
will
put
the
envelope
away
for
you
he
agreed
cheerily
wait
though
i
must
find
if
philip
left
the
key
of
the
compartment
on
his
he
took
from
his
pocket
the
keys
he
had
found
so
useful
the
night
before
and
selected
one
that
resembled
the
key
to
his
own
compartment
and
inserted
it
in
the
lock
to
his
surprise
he
discovered
the
compartment
was
already
unlocked
without
comment
he
pulled
open
the
inside
drawer
and
started
to
lay
the
white
envelope
on
top
of
the
papers
already
there
when
he
hesitated
the
envelope
is
unaddressed
helen
he
remarked
extending
it
toward
her
she
waved
it
back
it
is
sealed
with
red
wax
she
stated
that
is
all
that
is
necessary
for
kent
turned
over
the
envelope
the
flap
was
held
down
securely
with
a
large
red
seal
which
bore
the
one
letter
he
dropped
the
envelope
inside
the
drawer
locked
the
compartment
and
closed
the
door
of
the
safe
let
us
talk
he
suggested
and
led
the
way
back
to
their
chairs
helen
he
began
after
she
was
seated
there
is
nothing
i
will
not
do
for
your
sister
barbara
his
manner
grew
earnest
i
he
flushed
baring
his
feelings
to
another
no
matter
how
sympathetic
that
other
was
was
foreign
to
his
reserved
nature
i
love
her
beyond
words
to
express
i
tell
you
this
to
to
gain
your
you
already
have
it
harry
impulsively
helen
extended
her
hand
and
he
held
it
in
a
firm
clasp
for
a
second
babs
and
i
have
come
at
once
to
you
in
our
yes
but
you
have
only
hinted
what
that
trouble
was
he
reminded
her
gently
i
can
not
really
aid
you
until
you
give
me
your
full
helen
looked
away
from
him
and
out
of
the
window
the
relief
which
had
lighted
her
face
a
moment
before
had
vanished
it
was
some
minutes
before
she
answered
babs
told
you
that
i
suspected
jimmie
did
not
die
from
angina
pectoris
she
spoke
with
an
effort
she
waited
a
second
before
continuing
her
remarks
i
have
asked
the
coroner
to
make
an
she
paused
again
then
added
with
more
animation
he
is
the
one
to
tell
us
if
a
crime
has
been
he
can
tell
if
death
has
been
accelerated
by
a
weapon
or
a
drug
responded
kent
he
was
weighing
his
words
carefully
so
that
she
might
understand
him
fully
but
to
constitute
a
crime
it
has
to
be
proved
first
that
the
act
has
been
committed
and
second
that
a
guilty
mind
or
malice
prompted
it
can
you
furnish
a
clew
to
establish
either
of
the
last
mentioned
facts
in
connection
with
jimmie
death
kent
wondered
if
she
had
heard
him
she
was
so
long
in
replying
and
he
was
about
to
repeat
his
question
when
she
addressed
him
have
you
heard
from
coroner
penfield
no
i
tried
several
times
to
get
him
on
the
telephone
but
without
success
replied
kent
his
disappointment
at
not
receiving
an
answer
to
his
question
showed
in
his
manner
i
went
to
penfield
house
last
night
but
he
had
been
called
away
on
a
case
and
although
i
waited
until
nearly
ten
he
had
not
returned
when
i
left
have
you
had
word
from
him
not
not
she
had
been
nervously
twisting
her
handkerchief
about
in
her
fingers
suddenly
she
turned
and
looked
full
at
kent
her
eyes
burning
feverishly
i
would
give
all
i
possess
my
hope
of
future
happiness
even
if
i
could
prove
that
jimmie
died
from
angina
kent
looked
at
her
in
mingled
sympathy
and
what
did
her
words
imply
further
tragedy
jimmie
might
not
have
died
from
angina
pectoris
he
said
and
still
not
have
been
poisoned
you
mean
slowly
helen
took
in
his
meaning
but
she
volunteered
no
remark
and
kent
after
a
pause
added
while
i
have
not
seen
coroner
penfield
i
did
hear
last
night
what
killed
helen
straightened
up
one
hand
pressed
to
her
heart
it
was
a
lethal
dose
of
amyl
amyl
nitrite
she
repeated
yes
i
have
heard
that
it
is
given
for
heart
trouble
how
she
looked
at
him
queerly
how
is
it
administered
by
crushing
a
capsule
in
a
handkerchief
and
inhaling
its
fumes
he
was
watching
her
closely
the
handkerchief
jimmie
was
seen
to
use
just
before
he
died
was
found
to
contain
two
or
more
broken
helen
sat
immovable
for
over
a
minute
then
she
bowed
her
head
and
burst
into
dry
tearless
sobs
which
wracked
her
body
kent
laid
a
tender
hand
on
her
shoulder
then
concluding
it
was
better
for
her
to
have
her
cry
out
he
wandered
aimlessly
about
the
office
waiting
for
her
to
regain
her
composure
he
stopped
before
one
of
the
windows
facing
south
and
stared
moodily
at
the
belasco
theater
that
playhouse
had
surely
never
staged
a
more
complicated
mystery
than
the
one
he
had
set
himself
to
unravel
what
consolation
could
he
offer
helen
if
he
encouraged
her
belief
in
his
theory
that
jimmie
committed
suicide
he
would
have
to
establish
a
motive
for
suicide
and
that
motive
might
prove
to
be
the
theft
of
colonel
mcintyre
valuable
securities
threatened
with
exposure
as
a
thief
and
forger
jimmie
had
committed
suicide
so
would
run
the
verdict
the
fact
of
his
suicide
was
proof
of
his
guilt
of
the
crime
colonel
mcintyre
virtually
charged
him
with
and
vice
versa
what
had
been
discovered
to
point
to
murder
the
finding
of
a
handkerchief
saturated
with
amyl
nitrite
which
had
not
belonged
to
the
dead
man
proof
bah
it
was
ridiculous
what
more
likely
than
that
jimmie
while
in
the
mcintyre
house
before
his
arrest
as
a
burglar
had
picked
up
one
of
barbara
handkerchiefs
stuffed
it
inside
his
pocket
and
when
threatened
with
exposure
on
being
held
for
the
grand
jury
had
in
desperation
crushed
the
amyl
nitrite
capsules
in
handkerchief
and
killed
himself
kent
drew
a
long
long
sigh
his
faith
in
jimmie
honesty
was
shaken
at
last
by
the
accumulative
evidence
and
he
was
convinced
that
he
had
found
the
solution
to
the
problem
but
how
impart
it
to
the
weeping
girl
to
prove
her
lover
a
thief
forger
and
suicide
was
indeed
a
task
he
shrank
from
a
ring
at
the
telephone
caused
kent
to
move
hastily
to
the
instrument
when
he
hung
up
the
receiver
helen
was
adjusting
her
veil
before
a
mirror
over
the
mantel
colonel
mcintyre
is
in
the
next
room
he
said
keeping
his
voice
lowered
my
father
helen
eyes
were
hard
and
dry
does
he
know
that
i
am
here
i
do
know
sylvester
simply
said
he
had
called
to
see
me
and
is
waiting
in
the
outer
observing
her
indecision
kent
opened
the
door
leading
directly
into
the
corridor
you
can
leave
this
way
without
encountering
colonel
helen
hurried
through
the
door
and
paused
in
the
corridor
to
whisper
feverishly
in
kent
ear
promise
me
you
will
remain
faithful
to
barbara
whatever
i
will
kent
pledge
rang
out
clearly
and
helen
with
a
lighter
heart
turned
to
walk
away
when
a
telegraph
boy
appeared
around
the
corner
of
the
corridor
and
thrust
a
yellow
envelope
at
kent
who
stood
half
inside
his
office
watching
helen
sign
here
the
boy
said
indicating
the
line
on
the
receipt
slip
and
getting
it
back
departed
motioning
to
helen
to
wait
kent
tore
open
the
telegram
it
was
from
cleveland
and
dated
the
night
before
the
message
ran
called
to
cleveland
address
city
club
rochester
without
comment
kent
held
out
the
telegram
so
that
helen
could
read
it
what
she
exclaimed
philip
in
cleveland
last
night
i
i
and
looking
at
her
kent
was
astounded
at
the
flash
of
terror
which
shone
for
an
instant
in
her
eyes
before
he
had
time
to
question
her
she
bolted
around
the
corridor
kent
remained
staring
ahead
for
an
instant
then
returned
thoughtfully
to
his
office
and
within
a
second
sylvester
received
a
telephone
message
to
show
colonel
mcintyre
into
kent
office
not
only
colonel
mcintyre
followed
the
clerk
into
the
room
but
benjamin
clymer
any
further
developments
kent
inquired
the
banker
no
we
ca
sit
down
just
dropped
in
to
see
you
a
there
is
nothing
new
kent
had
made
instant
decision
such
information
regarding
the
death
of
turnbull
as
he
had
gleaned
from
ferguson
and
the
events
of
the
night
before
should
be
confided
to
clymer
alone
and
not
in
the
presence
of
colonel
mcintyre
did
you
search
turnbull
apartment
last
night
as
you
spoke
of
doing
asked
mcintyre
i
did
and
found
no
trace
of
your
securities
mcintyre
lifted
his
eyebrows
as
he
smiled
sarcastically
can
i
see
rochester
he
asked
he
is
in
cleveland
i
do
know
just
when
he
will
be
indeed
too
bad
you
have
the
benefit
of
his
advice
remarked
mcintyre
insolently
at
clymer
request
kent
i
have
allowed
you
until
saturday
night
to
find
the
securities
and
either
clear
name
or
admit
his
guilt
there
remain
two
days
and
a
half
before
i
take
the
affair
in
my
own
hands
and
make
it
i
hope
to
establish
turnbull
innocence
before
that
time
retorted
kent
coolly
inwardly
his
spirits
sank
had
not
every
effort
on
his
part
brought
but
further
proof
of
jimmie
guilt
that
mcintyre
would
make
no
attempt
to
hush
up
the
scandal
was
obvious
keep
me
informed
of
your
progress
mcintyre
manner
was
domineering
and
kent
felt
the
blood
mount
to
his
temples
but
he
was
determined
not
to
lose
his
temper
whatever
the
provocation
mcintyre
was
father
clymer
aware
that
the
atmosphere
was
getting
strained
diplomatically
intervened
dine
with
me
kent
he
said
perhaps
you
will
then
have
some
news
that
will
throw
light
on
the
present
whereabouts
of
the
securities
i
found
on
making
inquiries
that
they
have
not
been
offered
for
sale
in
the
usual
channels
come
mcintyre
i
have
a
directors
meeting
in
twenty
mcintyre
who
had
been
swinging
his
walking
stick
from
one
hand
to
the
other
in
marked
impatience
turned
to
kent
his
manner
more
conciliatory
pleasant
quarters
you
have
he
remarked
does
rochester
share
his
room
with
you
no
colonel
his
is
across
the
where
you
waited
a
few
minutes
ago
explained
kent
as
he
accompanied
his
visitors
to
the
door
this
is
my
ah
yes
i
thought
as
much
on
seeing
only
one
desk
mcintyre
manner
grew
more
cordial
does
rochester
furniture
duplicate
yours
safe
and
all
safe
no
he
has
none
that
is
the
firm
kent
was
becoming
restless
under
so
many
personal
questions
do
forget
at
eight
the
banker
reminded
him
before
stepping
into
the
corridor
we
dine
at
the
club
de
vingt
come
along
sylvester
stopped
kent
on
his
way
back
to
his
office
and
handed
him
the
neatly
typewritten
copies
of
his
brief
and
with
a
word
of
thanks
the
lawyer
went
over
to
his
desk
and
gathering
such
papers
as
he
required
at
the
court
house
he
thrust
them
and
the
brief
into
his
leather
bag
but
instead
of
hurrying
on
his
way
he
stood
still
to
consider
the
events
of
the
morning
helen
mcintyre
during
their
interview
had
not
responded
to
his
appeal
for
her
confidence
nor
vouchsafed
any
reason
for
her
belief
that
jimmie
turnbull
had
been
the
victim
of
foul
play
and
colonel
mcintyre
had
given
him
only
until
saturday
night
to
solve
the
problem
overwrought
feelings
found
vent
in
an
emphatic
oath
excuse
me
exclaimed
sylvester
mildly
from
the
doorway
i
knocked
and
understood
you
to
say
come
in
well
what
is
it
kent
nerves
were
getting
a
bit
raw
a
glance
at
his
watch
showed
him
he
had
a
slender
margin
only
in
which
to
reach
the
court
house
in
time
for
his
appointment
not
even
waiting
for
the
clerk
reply
he
snatched
up
his
brief
case
and
made
for
the
private
door
leading
into
the
corridor
but
he
was
destined
not
to
get
away
without
another
interruption
as
sylvester
was
hastily
explaining
two
gentlemen
to
see
you
kent
the
clerk
was
thrust
aside
and
detective
ferguson
entered
accompanied
by
a
deputy
marshal
sorry
to
detain
you
kent
exclaimed
the
detective
i
came
to
tell
you
that
coroner
penfield
has
just
called
an
inquest
for
this
afternoon
to
inquire
into
jimmie
turnbull
death
where
your
partner
rochester
looking
around
inquiringly
in
cleveland
wo
i
do
replied
kent
his
appointment
forgotten
in
the
news
that
ferguson
had
just
given
him
no
we
did
come
for
legal
advice
ferguson
smiled
then
grew
serious
what
rochester
address
kent
walked
over
to
his
desk
and
picked
up
the
telegram
the
city
club
cleveland
he
stated
thanks
ferguson
jotted
down
the
address
in
his
jones
here
placing
his
hand

his
companion

to
serve
rochester
with
a
subpoena
he
wanted
at
the
turnbull
inquest
as
a
material
chapter
viii
the
inquest
coroner
penfield
adjusted
his
eyeglasses
and
scanned
the
spectators
gathered
for
the
turnbull
inquest
the
room
was
crowded
with
both
men
and
women
the
latter
predominating
and
the
coroner
decided
that
while
some
had
come
from
a
personal
interest
in
the
dead
man
the
majority
had
been
attracted
by
morbid
curiosity
there
was
a
stir
among
the
spectators
as
an
inner
door
opened
and
the
jury
led
by
the
morgue
master
filed
into
the
room
and
took
their
places
coroner
penfield
rose
and
addressed
the
foreman
have
you
viewed
the
body
he
inquired
yes
doctor
and
the
man
sat
down
coroner
penfield
then
concisely
stated
the
reason
for
the
inquest
and
summoned
officer
to
the
witness
stand
the
policeman
stood
cap
in
hand
while
being
sworn
by
the
morgue
master
and
then
took
his
place
on
the
platform
in
the
chair
reserved
for
the
witnesses
his
answer
to
coroner
penfield
questions
relative
to
his
name
residence
in
washington
and
length
of
service
in
the
city
police
force
were
given
with
brevity
and
a
rich
irish
brogue
where
were
you
on
tuesday
morning
at
about
five
asked
penfield
first
consulting
some
memoranda
on
his
desk
on
my
way
home
explained
my
relief
had
just
does
your
beat
take
in
the
mcintyre
residence
it
does
did
you
observe
any
one
loitering
in
the
vicinity
of
the
residence
prior
to
five
tuesday
morning
no
sir
it
was
only
when
the
lady
called
to
me
that
i
was
attracted
to
the
did
she
state
what
was
the
matter
yes
sir
she
said
that
she
had
locked
a
burglar
in
a
closet
and
to
come
and
get
him
and
i
did
so
and
expanded
his
chest
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
as
be
glanced
about
the
morgue
did
the
burglar
resist
arrest
no
sir
he
came
very
peaceably
and
not
a
word
out
of
had
you
any
idea
that
the
burglar
was
not
what
he
seemed
devil
an
idea
begging
your
pardon
remembered
hastily
where
he
was
the
burglar
looked
the
part
he
was
masquerading
and
his
was
perfect
ended
with
relish
never
gave
me
a
hint
he
was
a
gentleman
and
a
bank
cashier
in
kent
who
had
arrived
at
the
morgue
a
few
minutes
before
the
policeman
commenced
his
testimony
smiled
in
spite
of
himself
he
was
feeling
exceedingly
low
spirited
and
had
come
to
the
inquest
with
inward
foreboding
as
to
its
result
on
what
developed
there
he
was
convinced
hung
jimmie
turnbull
good
name
after
his
interview
with
detective
ferguson
that
morning
he
had
wired
philip
rochester
to
return
to
washington
at
once
he
had
requested
an
immediate
reply
and
had
fully
expected
to
find
a
telegram
at
his
office
when
he
stopped
there
on
his
way
to
the
morgue
but
none
had
come
whom
did
you
see
in
the
mcintyre
house
the
coroner
asked
no
one
sir
except
the
burglar
and
miss
did
you
find
any
doors
or
windows
unlocked
no
sir
i
never
looked
to
why
not
because
the
young
lady
said
that
she
had
been
over
the
house
and
everything
was
then
looked
anxiously
at
the
coroner
would
he
make
him
out
derelict
in
his
duty
it
would
seriously
affect
his
standing
on
the
force
i
took
miss
mcintyre
word
for
the
house
for
i
had
the
burglar
safe
under
how
did
miss
mcintyre
appear
appear
sure
she
looked
very
sweet
in
her
blue
wrapper
and
her
hair
down
her
back
answered
with
emphasis
she
was
not
fully
dressed
then
no
was
miss
mcintyre
composed
in
manner
or
did
she
appear
frightened
asked
penfield
it
was
one
of
the
questions
which
kent
had
expected
and
he
waited
with
intense
interest
for
the
policeman
reply
she
was
very
pale
and
and
breathless
flapped
his
arms
about
vaguely
in
his
endeavor
to
demonstrate
his
meaning
she
kept
begging
me
to
hurry
and
get
the
burglar
out
of
the
house
and
after
telling
her
that
she
would
have
to
appear
in
the
police
court
first
thing
that
morning
i
went
off
with
the
were
there
lights
in
the
house
questioned
penfield
only
dim
ones
in
the
halls
and
two
bulbs
turned
on
in
the
library
a
big
room
though
and
they
hardly
made
any
light
at
all
explained
he
was
particular
as
to
details
i
used
handcuffs
on
the
prisoner
thinking
maybe
he
give
me
the
slip
in
the
dim
light
but
there
was
no
fight
or
flight
in
did
he
talk
to
you
on
the
way
to
the
station
house
no
sir
and
at
the
station
he
was
just
as
quiet
only
answered
the
questions
the
desk
sergeant
put
to
him
and
that
was
all
stated
ryan
penfield
laid
down
his
memorandum
pad
all
right
you
may
retire
and
at
the
words
the
policeman
left
the
platform
and
the
room
he
was
followed
by
the
police
sergeant
who
had
been
on
desk
duty
at
the
eighth
precinct
on
tuesday
morning
his
testimony
simply
corroborated
statement
that
the
prisoner
had
done
and
said
nothing
which
would
indicate
that
he
was
other
than
he
seemed
a
housebreaker
coroner
penfield
paused
before
calling
the
next
witness
and
drank
a
glass
of
ice
water
the
weather
had
turned
unseasonably
hot
and
the
room
in
which
inquests
were
held
was
stifling
in
spite
of
the
long
opened
windows
at
either
end
call
miss
helen
mcintyre
penfield
said
to
the
morgue
master
and
the
latter
crossed
to
the
door
leading
to
the
room
where
sat
the
witnesses
there
was
instant
craning
of
necks
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
society
girl
about
whom
with
her
twin
sister
so
much
interest
centered
helen
was
extremely
pale
as
she
advanced
up
the
room
but
kent
watching
her
closely
was
relieved
to
see
none
of
the
nervousness
which
had
been
so
marked
at
their
interview
that
morning
she
was
dressed
with
fastidious
taste
and
as
she
mounted
the
platform
after
the
morgue
master
had
administered
the
oath
coroner
penfield
rose
and
with
a
polite
gesture
indicated
the
chair
she
was
to
occupy
i
am
helen
mcintyre
she
announced
clearly
daughter
of
colonel
charles
tell
us
the
circumstances
attending
the
arrest
of
james
turnbull
alias
john
smith
in
your
house
on
tuesday
morning
miss
mcintyre
directed
the
coroner
seating
himself
at
his
table
on
which
were
writing
materials
i
was
sitting
up
to
let
in
my
sister
who
had
gone
to
a
dance
she
began
and
fearing
i
would
fall
asleep
i
went
down
into
the
library
intending
to
sit
in
one
of
the
window
recesses
and
watch
for
her
arrival
as
i
entered
the
library
i
saw
a
figure
steal
across
the
room
and
disappear
inside
a
closet
i
was
very
frightened
but
had
sense
enough
left
to
cross
softly
to
the
closet
and
lock
the
she
paused
in
her
rapid
recital
and
drew
a
long
breath
then
continued
more
slowly
i
hurried
to
the
window
and
across
the
street
i
saw
a
policeman
standing
under
a
it
took
but
a
minute
to
call
him
the
policeman
opened
the
closet
door
put
handcuffs
on
turnbull
and
took
him
coroner
penfield
as
well
as
the
jurors
followed
her
statement
with
absorbed
attention
at
its
end
he
threw
down
his
pencil
and
spoke
briefly
to
the
deputy
coroner
who
had
been
busily
engaged
in
taking
notes
of
the
inquest
and
then
he
turned
to
helen
you
heard
no
sound
before
entering
the
library
no
one
walking
about
the
house
he
persisted
she
followed
the
negative
with
a
short
explanation
i
lay
down
on
my
bed
soon
after
dinner
not
feeling
very
well
and
slept
through
the
early
hours
of
the
at
what
hour
did
you
wake
up
about
four
or
a
little
then
you
were
awake
an
hour
before
you
discovered
the
supposed
burglar
in
your
library
helen
hesitation
was
faint
about
that
length
of
and
you
heard
no
unusual
sounds
in
that
hour
interval
i
heard
nothing
her
manner
was
slightly
defiant
and
kent
heart
sank
if
he
had
only
thought
to
warn
her
not
to
antagonize
the
coroner
where
were
you
during
that
hour
lying
down
promptly
then
afraid
i
would
drop
off
to
sleep
again
i
went
coroner
penfield
consulted
his
notes
before
asking
another
question
who
lives
in
your
house
beside
you
and
your
twin
sister
he
asked
my
father
colonel
mcintyre
our
house
guest
louis
brewster
and
five
servants
she
replied
grimes
the
butler
martha
our
maid
jane
the
chambermaid
hope
our
cook
and
thomas
our
second
man
the
chauffeur
harris
the
scullery
maid
and
the
laundress
do
not
stay
at
who
were
at
home
beside
yourself
on
monday
night
and
early
tuesday
morning
my
father
and
brewster
i
believe
the
servants
were
in
also
except
thomas
who
had
asked
permission
to
spend
the
night
in
miss
mcintyre
coroner
penfield
put
the
next
question
in
an
impressive
manner
on
discovering
the
burglar
why
did
you
not
call
your
father
my
first
impulse
was
to
do
so
she
answered
promptly
but
on
leaving
the
library
i
passed
the
window
saw
the
policeman
and
called
him
she
shot
a
keen
look
at
the
coroner
and
added
softly
the
policeman
was
qualified
to
make
an
arrest
my
father
would
have
had
to
summon
one
had
he
been
quite
true
acknowledged
penfield
courteously
now
miss
mcintyre
why
did
the
prisoner
so
obligingly
walk
straight
into
a
closet
on
your
arrival
in
the
library
i
presume
he
was
looking
for
a
way
out
of
the
room
and
blundered
into
it
she
explained
there
are
seven
doors
opening
from
our
library
the
prisoner
may
have
heard
me
approaching
become
confused
and
walked
through
the
wrong
that
is
quite
plausible
with
an
ordinary
burglar
agreed
penfield
but
was
not
turnbull
acquainted
with
the
architectural
arrangements
of
your
house
he
was
a
frequent
caller
and
an
intimate
friend
she
said
with
dignity
as
to
his
power
of
observation
and
his
bump
of
locality
i
can
not
say
the
library
was
but
dimly
miss
mcintyre
penfield
spoke
slowly
were
you
aware
of
the
real
identity
of
the
burglar
i
had
no
suspicion
that
he
was
not
what
he
appeared
she
responded
he
said
or
did
nothing
after
his
arrest
to
give
me
the
slightest
inkling
of
his
penfield
raised
his
eyebrows
and
shot
a
look
at
the
deputy
coroner
before
going
on
with
his
examination
you
knew
turnbull
intimately
and
yet
you
did
not
recognize
him
he
asked
he
wore
an
admirable
helen
touched
her
lips
with
the
tip
of
her
tongue
inwardly
she
longed
for
the
glass
of
ice
water
which
she
saw
standing
on
the
reporters
table
mr
turnbull
associates
will
tell
you
that
he
excelled
in
amateur
penfield
looked
at
her
critically
for
a
moment
before
continuing
his
questions
she
bore
his
scrutiny
with
composure
officer
has
testified
that
you
informed
him
you
examined
the
windows
of
your
house
he
said
after
a
brief
wait
did
you
find
any
unlocked
yes
one
was
open
in
the
little
reception
room
off
the
front
what
floor
is
the
room
on
the
ground
would
it
have
been
easy
for
any
one
to
gain
admittance
through
the
window
without
attracting
attention
in
the
street
was
penfield
next
question
miss
mcintyre
penfield
rose
i
have
only
a
few
more
questions
to
put
to
you
why
did
turnbull
come
to
your
house
a
house
where
he
was
a
welcome
visitor
in
the
middle
of
the
night
disguised
as
a
burglar
the
reporters
as
well
as
the
spectators
bent
forward
to
catch
her
reply
mr
turnbull
had
a
wager
with
my
sister
barbara
she
explained
she
bet
him
that
he
could
not
break
into
the
house
without
being
penfield
considered
her
answer
before
addressing
her
again
why
did
turnbull
tell
you
who
he
was
when
you
had
him
arrested
he
asked
helen
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
can
not
answer
that
question
for
i
do
not
know
his
reason
if
he
had
only
confided
in
me
her
voice
shook
he
might
have
been
alive
how
so
penfield
shot
the
question
at
her
because
then
he
would
have
been
spared
the
additional
excitement
of
his
trip
to
the
police
station
and
the
scene
in
court
which
brought
on
his
attack
of
angina
penfield
regarded
her
for
a
moment
in
silence
i
have
no
further
questions
miss
mcintyre
he
said
and
turned
to
the
morgue
master
ask
miss
barbara
mcintyre
to
come
to
the
turning
back
to
his
table
and
the
papers
thereon
he
failed
to
see
the
twins
pass
each
other
in
the
aisle
they
were
identically
attired
and
when
coroner
penfield
looked
again
at
the
witness
chair
he
stared
in
surprise
at
its
occupant
i
beg
pardon
miss
mcintyre
i
desire
your
sister
to
testify
he
remarked
i
am
barbara
a
haunting
quality
in
her
voice
caught
attention
and
he
leaned
eagerly
forward
his
eyes
following
each
movement
of
her
nervous
fingers
busily
twisting
her
gloves
inside
and
out
i
beg
your
pardon
exclaimed
the
coroner
recovering
from
his
surprise
he
had
seen
the
twins
at
the
police
court
on
tuesday
morning
for
a
second
only
and
then
his
attention
had
been
entirely
centered
on
helen
he
had
heard
but
had
not
realized
until
that
moment
how
striking
was
the
resemblance
between
the
sisters
miss
mcintyre
the
coroner
cleared
his
throat
and
commenced
his
examination
where
were
you
on
monday
night
at
a
dance
given
by
and
charles
at
what
hour
did
you
return
i
think
it
was
half
past
five
or
a
few
minutes
who
let
you
in
my
did
you
see
the
burglar
he
had
left
she
answered
my
sister
told
me
of
her
adventure
as
we
went
upstairs
to
our
miss
mcintyre
penfield
picked
up
a
page
of
the
deputy
closely
written
notes
and
ran
his
eyes
down
it
your
sister
has
testified
that
james
turnbull
went
to
your
house
disguised
as
a
burglar
on
a
wager
with
you
what
were
the
terms
of
that
wager
i
bet
him
that
he
could
not
enter
the
house
after
midnight
without
his
presence
being
detected
by
our
new
police
dogs
exclaimed
barbara
slowly
she
had
stopped
twirling
her
gloves
about
and
one
hand
was
firmly
clenched
over
the
arm
of
her
chair
did
the
dogs
discover
his
presence
in
the
house
apparently
not
or
they
would
have
aroused
the
household
she
said
i
can
not
answer
that
question
though
because
i
was
not
at
where
are
the
dogs
kept
in
the
garage
in
the
and
at
night
he
persisted
they
roam
about
our
house
she
admitted
or
sleep
in
the
boudoir
which
is
between
my
sister
bedroom
and
mine
were
the
dogs
in
the
house
on
monday
night
i
did
not
see
them
on
my
return
from
the
that
is
not
an
answer
to
my
question
miss
mcintyre
the
coroner
pointed
out
were
the
dogs
in
the
house
there
was
a
distinct
pause
before
she
spoke
i
recall
hearing
our
butler
grimes
say
that
he
found
the
dogs
in
the
cellar
shocking
death
put
all
else
out
of
my
mind
i
never
once
thought
of
the
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
was
a
wager
over
the
dogs
which
brought
about
the
whole
situation
remarked
the
coroner
dryly
barbara
flushed
at
his
tone
then
grew
pale
i
honestly
forgot
about
the
dogs
she
repeated
father
sent
them
out
to
our
country
place
tuesday
afternoon
they
annoyed
our
our
guest
in
what
way
by
barking
are
noisy
and
yet
they
did
not
arouse
the
household
when
turnbull
broke
into
the
house
coroner
penfield
regarded
her
sternly
how
do
you
account
for
that
barbara
right
hand
stole
to
the
arm
of
her
chair
and
clasped
it
with
the
same
convulsive
strength
that
she
clung
to
the
other
chair
arm
when
she
spoke
her
voice
was
barely
audible
i
can
account
for
it
in
two
ways
she
began
if
the
dogs
were
accidentally
locked
in
the
cellar
they
could
not
possibly
hear
turnbull
moving
about
the
house
if
they
were
roaming
about
and
scented
him
they
might
not
have
barked
because
they
would
recognize
him
as
a
were
the
dogs
familiar
with
his
step
and
voice
yes
only
last
sunday
he
played
with
them
for
an
hour
and
later
in
the
afternoon
took
them
for
a
walk
in
the
i
penfield
stroked
his
chin
reflectively
when
your
sister
told
you
of
finding
the
burglar
and
his
arrest
did
you
not
in
the
light
of
your
wager
suspect
that
he
might
be
turnbull
barbara
eyes
did
not
falter
before
his
direct
gaze
i
supposed
that
turnbull
meant
to
try
and
enter
the
house
in
his
own
proper
person
it
never
dawned
on
me
that
he
would
resort
to
disguise
besides
as
the
coroner
started
to
make
a
remark
we
have
had
numerous
robberies
in
our
neighborhood
and
the
apartment
house
two
blocks
from
us
has
had
a
regular
epidemic
of
sneak
the
coroner
waited
until
mayo
who
had
been
writing
with
feverish
haste
had
picked
up
a
fresh
sheet
of
paper
before
resuming
his
examination
you
accompanied
your
sister
to
the
police
court
he
said
did
you
see
the
burglar
there
did
you
realize
his
identity
in
the
court
room
no
i
only
awoke
to
to
the
situation
when
i
saw
him
lying
dead
with
his
wig
removed
the
shock
was
frightful
she
closed
her
eyes
for
a
second
for
the
room
and
the
rows
of
faces
confronting
her
were
mixed
in
a
maddening
maze
and
she
raised
her
hand
to
her
swimming
head
when
she
looked
up
she
found
coroner
penfield
by
her
side
that
is
all
he
said
kindly
please
remain
in
the
witness
room
i
may
call
you
again
and
he
helped
her
down
the
step
with
careful
attention
back
in
his
corner
kent
watched
her
departure
he
was
white
to
the
lips
heat
too
much
for
you
asked
a
stranger
and
kent
gave
a
mumbled
no
as
he
strove
to
pull
himself
together
what
deviltry
was
afoot
how
dared
the
twins
take
such
risks
to
bear
false
witness
was
a
grave
criminal
offense
he
alone
among
all
the
spectators
had
realized
that
in
testifying
before
the
inquest
the
twins
had
swapped
identities
chapter
ix
the
return
of
the
morgue
master
to
the
platform
caused
coroner
penfield
to
break
off
his
whispered
conversation
with
mayo
colonel
mcintyre
just
telephoned
that
his
car
had
a
on
the
way
here
explained
the
morgue
master
he
will
arrive
penfield
consulted
a
list
of
names
call
grimes
the
mcintyre
butler
he
said
we
will
hear
him
while
waiting
for
the
grimes
small
and
thin
with
the
stolid
countenance
of
the
servant
was
exceedingly
short
in
his
replies
to
the
questions
yes
he
had
lived
with
the
mcintyre
during
their
residence
in
washington
something
like
five
years
he
could
quite
remember
the
exact
dates
no
there
was
never
any
quarreling
upstairs
or
down
it
was
a
household
until
this
exactly
remarked
the
coroner
dryly
what
about
monday
night
tell
us
grimes
what
occurred
in
that
house
between
midnight
monday
and
five
tuesday
have
much
to
tell
was
the
grumpy
response
i
went
upstairs
about
eleven
and
got
down
the
next
morning
at
the
usual
hour
seven
and
you
heard
no
disturbing
sounds
in
the
night
no
sir
we
would
be
likely
to
the
servants
rooms
are
all
at
the
top
of
the
house
and
the
staircase
leading
to
them
has
a
brick
wall
on
either
side
like
stairs
leading
to
an
ordinary
attic
and
there
a
door
at
the
bottom
which
shuts
off
all
sound
from
it
was
the
longest
sentence
the
butler
had
indulged
in
and
he
paused
for
breath
who
closes
the
house
at
night
grimes
i
do
sir
why
did
you
leave
the
window
in
the
reception
room
open
i
did
sir
was
the
prompt
denial
i
had
just
locked
it
when
brewster
came
in
along
with
colonel
mcintyre
and
clymer
and
they
sat
down
to
talk
when
i
left
the
room
the
window
was
locked
fast
and
so
was
every
door
and
window
in
the
place
he
declared
aggressively
i
take
my
dying
oath
to
it
penfield
looked
at
grimes
that
he
was
telling
the
truth
was
unmistakable
who
sits
up
to
let
in
the
young
ladies
when
they
go
to
balls
he
asked
generally
no
one
sir
because
colonel
mcintyre
accompanies
them
or
calls
for
them
and
he
has
his
lately
added
grimes
as
an
miss
helen
has
been
using
a
duplicate
has
miss
barbara
mcintyre
a
also
asked
penfield
no
sir
i
believe
not
the
butler
looked
dubious
i
recall
that
colonel
mcintyre
gave
miss
helen
her
key
at
the
luncheon
table
and
he
said
then
to
miss
barbara
that
he
could
trust
her
with
one
because
she
would
be
sure
to
lose
it
she
is
that
the
coroner
asked
the
next
question
with
such
abruptness
that
the
butler
started
when
did
you
last
see
turnbull
at
the
house
sunday
grimes
reply
was
spoken
with
more
than
his
accustomed
quickness
of
speech
mr
turnbull
called
twice
after
a
long
time
in
the
drawing
room
he
went
away
taking
the
police
dogs
with
him
and
later
called
to
bring
them
where
were
these
dogs
on
monday
night
i
last
saw
them
in
the
library
replied
grimes
shortly
and
where
did
you
find
them
the
next
morning
prompted
the
coroner
in
the
cellar
laconically
and
what
were
they
doing
in
the
cellar
hunting
and
how
did
the
dogs
get
in
the
cellar
inquired
the
coroner
patiently
grimes
was
not
volunteering
information
even
if
he
could
not
be
accused
of
holding
it
back
some
one
must
have
let
them
down
the
back
stairs
the
butler
admitted
i
do
know
who
it
which
servant
got
downstairs
ahead
of
you
on
tuesday
morning
no
one
sir
the
cook
and
she
and
the
maids
came
down
in
a
bunch
ten
minutes
and
who
told
you
of
the
attempted
burglary
and
the
burglar
arrest
asked
penfield
miss
barbara
she
asked
us
to
hurry
breakfast
for
her
and
miss
helen
they
had
to
go
at
once
to
the
police
court
she
did
give
any
particulars
or
nothing
added
grimes
in
an
injured
tone
thomas
and
i
saw
the
afternoon
papers
that
we
knew
what
had
been
going
on
in
our
own
that
is
all
grimes
announced
penfield
and
the
butler
left
the
platform
with
the
same
stolid
air
he
wore
when
he
arrived
he
was
followed
in
the
witness
chair
by
the
other
mcintyre
servants
in
succession
their
testimony
added
nothing
to
what
he
had
said
but
simply
confirmed
his
statements
kent
who
had
grown
restless
during
the
servants
monotonous
testimony
forgot
the
oppressive
atmosphere
of
the
room
on
seeing
brewster
enter
under
the
escort
of
the
morgue
master
spying
a
vacant
seat
several
rows
ahead
of
where
he
was
sitting
kent
with
a
muttered
apology
to
the
people
over
whom
he
crawled
in
his
efforts
to
get
out
hurried
into
it
just
as
the
vivacious
widow
had
finished
taking
the
oath
to
tell
the
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
and
seated
herself
with
much
rustling
of
silk
skirts
in
the
witness
chair
state
your
full
name
madam
directed
coroner
penfield
eyeing
her
dainty
beauty
with
admiration
margaret
perry
brewster
she
answered
widow
of
louis
brewster
both
i
and
my
late
husband
were
born
and
lived
in
los
angeles
are
you
visiting
the
misses
mcintyre
brewster
spoke
in
a
chatty
impersonal
manner
i
have
been
with
them
since
the
first
of
the
did
you
attend
the
grosvenor
dance
asked
the
coroner
no
the
affair
was
only
given
for
the
debutantes
of
last
fall
and
did
not
include
married
people
she
explained
it
was
a
warm
night
and
colonel
mcintyre
asked
benjamin
clymer
who
was
dining
with
him
and
me
to
go
for
a
motor
ride
leaving
barbara
at
the
grosvenors
en
route
we
did
so
returning
to
the
house
about
eleven
and
sat
talking
until
about
midnight
in
the
reception
room
then
colonel
mcintyre
drove
clymer
home
and
i
went
to
my
were
you
awakened
by
any
noises
during
the
night
inquired
penfield
no
i
heard
no
brewster
charming
smile
was
infectious
when
did
you
first
learn
of
the
supposed
burglary
and
the
death
of
james
turnbull
the
mcintyre
twins
told
me
about
the
tragedy
on
their
return
from
the
police
court
answered
brewster
and
settled
herself
a
little
more
comfortably
in
the
witness
chair
when
you
were
in
the
reception
room
brewster
penfield
paused
and
studied
his
notes
a
second
did
you
observe
if
the
window
was
open
or
closed
it
was
not
open
when
we
entered
she
responded
but
the
air
in
the
room
was
stuffy
and
at
my
request
clymer
raised
the
did
he
close
it
later
she
considered
the
question
i
really
do
not
recall
she
admitted
finally
her
eyes
strayed
toward
the
door
through
which
she
had
entered
and
penfield
answered
her
unspoken
thought
just
one
more
question
he
said
hurriedly
did
you
see
the
dogs
on
monday
night
yes
i
heard
them
scratching
at
the
door
leading
to
the
basement
as
i
went
upstairs
and
so
i
turned
around
and
went
down
and
opened
the
door
and
let
them
run
down
into
the
penfield
snapped
shut
his
notebook
i
am
greatly
obliged
brewster
we
will
not
detain
you
the
morgue
master
stepped
forward
and
helped
the
pretty
widow
down
from
the
platform
colonel
mcintyre
is
here
now
he
told
the
coroner
ah
then
bring
him
in
and
penfield
while
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
new
witness
straightened
the
papers
on
his
desk
mcintyre
looked
straight
ahead
of
him
as
he
walked
down
the
room
and
stood
frowning
heavily
while
the
oath
was
being
administered
but
his
manner
when
the
coroner
addressed
him
had
regained
all
the
suavity
and
polish
which
had
first
captivated
washington
society
i
have
been
a
resident
of
washington
for
about
five
years
he
said
in
answer
to
the
coroner
question
my
daughters
attended
school
here
after
their
return
from
paris
where
they
were
in
a
convent
for
four
years
they
made
their
debut
last
november
at
our
home
in
this
were
you
aware
of
the
wager
between
your
daughter
barbara
and
james
turnbull
asked
penfield
i
heard
of
it
sunday
afternoon
but
paid
little
attention
admitted
mcintyre
my
daughter
barbara
vagaries
i
seldom
take
was
turnbull
a
frequent
visitor
at
your
house
oh
was
he
engaged
to
your
daughter
helen
mcintyre
denial
was
prompt
and
firmly
spoken
penfield
and
kent
from
his
new
seat
nearer
the
platform
watched
the
colonel
narrowly
but
learned
nothing
from
his
expression
i
have
heard
otherwise
observed
the
coroner
dryly
you
have
been
misinformed
mcintyre
manner
was
short
i
would
suggest
coroner
that
you
confine
your
questions
and
conjectures
to
matters
pertinent
to
this
penfield
flushed
as
one
of
the
jurors
snickered
but
he
did
not
repeat
his
previous
question
asking
instead
was
there
good
feeling
between
you
and
turnbull
i
never
quarreled
with
him
replied
mcintyre
i
really
saw
little
of
him
as
whenever
he
called
at
the
house
he
came
to
see
one
or
the
other
of
my
daughters
or
when
did
you
last
see
turnbull
inquired
penfield
he
was
at
the
house
on
sunday
and
i
had
quite
a
talk
with
him
mcintyre
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
regarded
the
neat
crease
in
his
trousers
with
critical
eyes
i
last
saw
turnbull
going
out
of
the
street
were
you
disturbed
by
the
burglar
entrance
on
monday
night
mcintyre
shook
his
head
i
am
a
heavy
sleeper
he
said
i
regret
very
much
that
my
daughter
helen
did
not
at
once
awaken
me
on
finding
the
burglar
as
she
supposed
hiding
in
the
closet
i
knew
nothing
of
the
affair
until
grimes
informed
me
of
it
and
only
reached
the
police
court
in
time
to
bring
my
daughters
home
from
the
distressing
scene
following
the
identification
of
the
dead
burglar
as
jimmie
colonel
mcintyre
penfield
turned
over
several
papers
until
he
found
the
one
he
sought
mrs
brewster
has
testified
that
while
you
and
she
were
sitting
in
the
reception
room
clymer
opened
the
window
did
you
close
it
on
leaving
the
room
mcintyre
reflected
before
answering
i
can
not
remember
doing
so
he
stated
finally
clymer
was
in
rather
a
hurry
to
leave
and
after
bidding
brewster
good
night
we
went
straight
out
to
the
car
and
i
drove
him
to
the
then
you
can
not
swear
to
the
window
having
been
i
can
not
penfield
paused
a
moment
did
you
return
immediately
to
your
house
from
the
saratoga
apartment
i
did
promptly
my
chauffeur
harris
was
well
and
i
wanted
him
to
get
penfield
thought
a
moment
before
putting
the
next
question
how
did
miss
barbara
return
from
the
grosvenor
dance
he
asked
she
was
brought
home
by
friends
colonel
and
mcintyre
in
turning
about
in
his
chair
knocked
down
his
walking
stick
from
its
resting
place
against
its
side
and
the
unexpected
clatter
made
several
women
nervously
inclined
jump
in
their
seats
observing
them
mcintyre
smiled
and
was
still
smiling
amusedly
when
penfield
addressed
him
did
you
observe
many
lights
burning
in
your
house
when
you
returned
asked
penfield
no
only
those
which
are
usually
left
lit
at
was
your
daughter
helen
awake
i
do
not
know
her
room
was
in
darkness
when
i
walked
past
her
door
on
my
way
to
penfield
removed
his
and
polished
them
on
his
silk
handkerchief
i
have
no
further
questions
to
ask
colonel
you
are
mcintyre
bowed
gravely
to
him
and
as
he
left
the
platform
came
face
to
face
with
his
family
physician
stone
penfield
who
was
an
old
acquaintance
of
the
physician
signed
to
him
to
come
on
the
platform
after
the
preliminaries
had
been
gone
through
he
shifted
his
chair
around
the
better
to
face
stone
did
you
accompany
the
misses
mcintyre
to
the
police
court
on
tuesday
morning
he
asked
i
did
responded
the
physician
at
miss
barbara
request
she
said
her
sister
was
not
very
well
and
they
disliked
going
alone
to
the
police
did
she
state
why
she
did
not
ask
her
father
to
go
with
them
only
that
he
had
not
fully
recovered
from
an
attack
of
tonsillitis
which
i
knew
to
be
a
fact
and
they
did
not
want
him
to
his
there
was
a
moment
pause
as
the
coroner
his
attention
diverted
by
a
whispered
word
or
two
from
the
morgue
master
referred
to
his
notes
before
resuming
his
examination
did
you
know
james
turnbull
he
asked
a
second
later
yes
did
you
recognize
him
in
his
burglar
disguise
i
did
not
had
you
any
suspicion
that
the
burglar
was
other
than
he
seemed
penfield
picked
up
a
memorandum
handed
him
by
mayo
and
referred
to
it
i
understand
doctor
that
you
were
the
first
to
go
to
the
burglar
aid
when
he
became
ill
he
said
is
that
true
yes
stone
spoke
with
more
animation
happening
to
glance
inside
the
cage
where
the
prisoner
sat
i
saw
he
was
struggling
convulsively
for
breath
with
clymer
assistance
i
carried
him
into
an
off
the
court
but
before
i
had
crossed
its
threshold
turnbull
expired
in
my
was
he
conscious
before
he
died
at
the
question
kent
bent
eagerly
forward
what
would
be
the
reply
i
am
not
prepared
to
answer
that
with
certainty
replied
stone
cautiously
as
i
picked
him
up
i
heard
him
stammer
faintly
kent
started
so
violently
that
the
man
next
to
him
turned
and
regarded
him
for
a
moment
then
more
interested
in
what
was
transpiring
on
the
platform
promptly
forgot
his
agitated
neighbor
was
turnbull
delirious
doctor
asked
the
coroner
stone
shook
his
head
in
denial
no
he
stated
i
take
it
that
he
started
to
say
and
his
breath
failed
him
at
any
rate
i
only
caught
the
stuttered
penfield
did
not
immediately
continue
his
examination
but
when
he
did
so
his
manner
was
stern
doctor
what
in
your
opinion
caused
turnbull
death
judging
superficially
i
made
no
thorough
examination
stone
explained
parenthetically
i
should
say
that
rochester
was
right
when
he
stated
that
turnbull
died
from
an
acute
attack
of
angina
how
did
rochester
come
to
make
that
assertion
and
where
immediately
after
turnbull
death
replied
stone
mr
rochester
who
shared
his
apartment
defended
him
in
court
rochester
was
aware
that
turnbull
suffered
from
the
disease
and
clymer
who
was
present
also
knew
and
what
is
your
opinion
doctor
questioned
penfield
stone
hesitated
there
was
a
distinct
odor
of
amyl
nitrite
noticeable
when
i
went
to
turnbull
aid
and
i
concluded
then
that
he
had
some
heart
trouble
and
had
inhaled
the
drug
to
ward
off
an
attack
it
bears
out
rochester
theory
of
death
from
angina
i
see
thank
you
doctor
please
wait
with
the
other
witnesses
we
may
call
you
again
and
with
a
sigh
the
busy
physician
resigned
himself
to
spending
another
hour
in
the
room
reserved
for
the
witnesses
the
next
to
take
the
witness
stand
was
deputy
marshal
grant
his
testimony
was
short
and
concise
and
his
description
of
the
scene
in
the
police
court
preceding
turnbull
death
was
listened
to
with
deep
attention
by
every
one
did
the
prisoner
show
any
symptoms
of
illness
before
his
heart
attack
asked
penfield
not
exactly
illness
replied
grant
slowly
i
noticed
he
did
move
very
quickly
sort
of
shambled
as
if
he
was
weak
in
his
legs
seen
and
disorderlies
act
just
that
way
and
paid
no
particular
attention
to
him
he
did
ask
for
a
drink
of
water
just
after
he
returned
to
the
did
you
give
it
to
him
no
an
attendant
gave
the
glass
to
rochester
who
handed
it
to
penfield
regarded
grant
in
silence
for
a
minute
that
is
all
he
announced
and
with
a
polite
bow
the
deputy
marshal
withdrew
detective
ferguson
recognized
kent
as
he
passed
up
the
room
to
the
platform
and
gave
him
a
slight
bow
and
smile
but
the
smile
had
disappeared
when
at
the
coroner
request
he
told
of
his
arrival
just
after
the
discovery
of
the
burglar
identity
i
searched
the
cage
where
the
prisoner
had
been
seated
and
found
this
handkerchief
he
went
on
to
say
it
had
been
dropped
by
turnbull
and
was
saturated
with
amyl
nitrite
i
had
it
examined
by
a
chemist
who
said
that
this
amyl
nitrite
was
given
to
patients
with
heart
trouble
in
little
pearl
capsules
to
be
crushed
in
handkerchiefs
and
the
fumes
inhaled
the
chemist
also
told
me
that
the
detective
spoke
with
impressive
seriousness
judging
from
the
number
of
particles
of
capsules
adhering
to
the
linen
more
than
one
capsule
had
been
crushed
by
turnbull
here
is
the
handkerchief
and
he
laid
it
on
the
table
with
great
care
kent
heart
sank
the
moment
he
had
dreaded
all
that
long
afternoon
had
come
penfield
inspected
the
handkerchief
with
interest
and
then
passed
it
to
the
jurors
cautioning
them
to
handle
it
carefully
i
note
he
stated
turning
again
to
detective
ferguson
that
it
is
a
woman
it
is
replied
ferguson
and
embroidered
in
one
corner
is
the
initial
penfield
ran
his
fingers
through
his
gray
hair
you
may
go
ferguson
he
said
and
beckoned
to
the
morgue
master
ask
miss
barbara
mcintyre
to
the
girl
was
quick
in
answering
the
summons
kent
more
and
more
worried
was
watching
the
scene
with
painful
attention
did
turnbull
have
one
of
your
handkerchiefs
asked
penfield
her
surprise
at
the
question
was
manifest
in
her
manner
he
might
have
she
said
i
have
a
dreadful
habit
of
dropping
my
handkerchiefs
did
you
miss
one
after
his
visit
to
your
house
on
monday
night
miss
mcintyre
penfield
took
up
the
handkerchief
which
the
foreman
replaced
on
his
desk
a
moment
before
and
holding
it
with
care
extended
it
toward
the
girl
is
this
your
handkerchief
she
inspected
the
handkerchief
and
the
initial
with
curiosity
but
with
nothing
more
kent
was
convinced
and
in
his
relief
was
almost
guilty
of
disturbing
the
decorum
of
the
inquest
with
a
shout
of
joy
it
is
not
my
handkerchief
she
stated
clearly
penfield
replaced
the
handkerchief
on
the
table
with
the
same
care
he
had
picked
it
up
and
turned
again
to
her
thank
you
miss
mcintyre
i
wo
detain
you
longer
logan
to
the
morgue
master
ask
stone
to
step
almost
immediately
stone
reentered
the
room
and
hurried
to
the
platform
would
two
or
more
capsules
of
amyl
nitrite
constitute
a
lethal
dose
asked
penfield
they
would
be
very
apt
to
finish
a
feeble
heart
replied
stone
three
capsules
if
inhaled
deeply
would
certainly
kill
a
healthy
penfield
showed
the
handkerchief
to
the
physician
can
a
chemist
tell
from
the
particles
clinging
to
this
handkerchief
how
many
capsules
have
been
used
i
should
say
he
stone
looked
grave
as
he
inspected
the
linen
taking
careful
note
of
the
letter
b
in
one
corner
of
the
handkerchief
but
there
is
this
to
be
considered
turnbull
may
not
have
crushed
those
capsules
all
at
the
same
what
do
you
mean
he
may
have
felt
an
attack
coming
on
earlier
in
the
evening
and
used
a
capsule
and
in
the
police
court
used
the
same
handkerchief
in
the
same
i
see
penfield
nodded
the
point
is
cleverly
kent
silently
agreed
with
the
coroner
the
next
instant
stone
was
excused
and
after
a
slight
pause
the
deputy
coroner
mayo
left
his
table
and
his
notes
and
occupied
the
witness
chair
after
first
being
sworn
the
preliminaries
did
not
consume
much
time
and
manner
was
brisk
as
he
addressed
his
assistant
did
you
make
a
examination
of
turnbull
he
asked
i
did
sir
in
the
presence
of
the
morgue
master
and
mayo
displayed
an
anatomical
chart
drawing
his
pencil
down
it
as
he
talked
we
found
from
the
condition
of
the
heart
that
the
deceased
had
suffered
from
angina
pectoris
he
paused
and
spoke
more
slowly
in
examining
the
gastric
contents
we
found
the
presence
of
aconitine
questioned
penfield
and
the
reporters
scenting
the
sensational
leaned
forward
eagerly
so
as
not
to
miss
the
deputy
coroner
answer
aconitine
an
active
poison
he
explained
it
is
the
alkaloid
of
aconite
and
generally
fatal
in
its
chapter
x
at
the
club
de
vingt
the
large
building
of
the
popular
club
de
vingt
or
as
one
washingtonian
put
it
the
club
de
vin
which
had
sprung
into
existence
in
the
national
capital
during
the
war
was
ablaze
with
light
and
benjamin
clymer
sitting
at
a
small
table
in
one
corner
of
the
wished
most
heartily
that
it
had
been
less
crowded
many
were
being
given
that
night
and
it
was
only
by
dint
of
perseverance
and
a
treasury
note
that
he
had
finally
induced
the
head
waiter
to
put
in
an
extra
table
for
him
and
his
guest
harry
kent
kent
had
been
very
late
and
to
add
to
his
had
been
silent
not
to
say
morose
during
dinner
clymer
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
when
the
table
was
cleared
and
coffee
and
cigars
placed
before
them
kent
roused
himself
from
his
abstraction
we
can
not
talk
here
he
said
looking
at
the
gay
diners
who
surrounded
them
and
i
have
several
important
matters
to
discuss
with
you
his
remark
was
overheard
by
their
waiter
and
he
stopped
pouring
out
kent
coffee
there
is
a
small
smoking
room
to
the
right
of
the
dining
room
he
suggested
i
passed
there
but
a
moment
ago
and
it
was
not
occupied
if
you
desire
sir
i
will
serve
coffee
an
excellent
clymer
rose
quickly
and
he
and
kent
followed
the
waiter
to
the
inclosed
porch
which
had
been
converted
into
an
attractive
lounging
room
for
the
club
members
it
was
much
cooler
than
the
dining
room
and
kent
was
grateful
for
the
subdued
light
given
out
by
the
artistically
shaded
lamps
with
which
it
was
furnished
there
was
silence
while
the
waiter
with
deft
fingers
arranged
the
coffee
and
cigars
on
a
wicker
table
then
receiving
clymer
generous
tip
with
a
word
of
thanks
the
man
departed
kent
wheeled
his
chair
around
so
as
to
face
his
companion
and
still
have
a
side
view
of
the
dining
room
where
tables
were
being
rapidly
removed
for
the
dance
which
followed
dinners
on
thursday
nights
clymer
selected
a
cigar
with
care
and
leaning
back
in
his
chair
until
the
wicker
creaked
under
his
weight
he
waited
patiently
for
kent
to
speak
it
was
fully
five
minutes
before
kent
addressed
him
so
james
turnbull
was
poisoned
after
all
he
commented
a
week
ago
i
would
have
sworn
that
jimmie
had
an
enemy
in
the
ah
but
he
had
and
a
very
bitter
vindictive
enemy
if
the
evidence
given
at
the
coroner
inquest
this
afternoon
is
to
be
believed
replied
clymer
seriously
the
case
is
remarkably
it
kent
bit
savagely
at
his
cigar
as
a
slight
vent
to
his
feelings
by
a
dose
of
aconitine
by
a
person
or
persons
unknown
was
the
jury
verdict
and
a
nice
tangle
they
have
left
me
to
ferret
out
you
yes
i
going
to
solve
this
mystery
if
it
is
a
possible
tone
was
grim
and
colonel
mcintyre
only
gave
me
until
saturday
night
to
work
clymer
eyed
him
in
surprise
mcintyre
desires
to
get
back
his
lost
securities
judging
from
his
comments
after
the
inquest
he
is
not
particularly
interested
in
who
killed
but
i
am
exclaimed
kent
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
more
convinced
i
am
that
the
forged
letter
with
the
subsequent
disappearance
of
mcintyre
securities
has
some
connection
with
jimmie
untimely
death
be
it
murder
or
suicide
clymer
raised
eyebrows
indicated
his
surprise
yes
shortly
aconitine
would
have
killed
just
as
surely
if
swallowed
with
suicidal
intent
as
if
administered
with
murderous
a
pause
followed
which
neither
man
seemed
anxious
to
break
then
kent
turned
to
the
banker
and
the
latter
noticed
the
haggard
lines
in
his
face
listen
to
me
clymer
he
began
my
instinct
tells
me
that
jimmie
turnbull
never
forged
that
letter
or
stole
mcintyre
securities
but
i
admit
that
everything
points
to
his
guilt
even
his
how
so
because
the
theft
of
the
securities
supplies
a
motive
for
his
suicide
fear
of
exposure
and
imprisonment
argued
kent
but
there
is
no
motive
so
far
as
i
can
see
for
jimmie
murder
men
do
kill
each
other
without
a
there
is
homicidal
mania
suggested
clymer
but
not
in
this
case
retorted
kent
we
are
sane
men
and
it
is
up
to
us
to
find
out
if
jimmie
died
by
his
own
hand
or
was
killed
by
some
unknown
enemy
rest
easy
kent
said
a
voice
from
the
doorway
and
kent
who
had
turned
his
back
in
that
direction
the
better
to
talk
to
clymer
whirled
around
and
found
detective
ferguson
regarding
him
just
inside
the
threshold
mr
turnbull
enemy
is
not
unknown
and
will
soon
be
under
who
is
he
demanded
clymer
and
kent
simultaneously
philip
clymer
was
the
first
to
recover
from
his
astonishment
oh
get
out
he
exclaimed
incredulously
why
rochester
was
turnbull
most
intimate
until
they
fell
in
love
with
the
same
girl
answered
ferguson
succinctly
taking
possession
of
the
only
other
chair
the
porch
boasted
one
quarrel
led
to
another
and
then
rochester
did
for
him
oh
it
nicely
motive
jealous
anger
opportunity
recognition
in
court
of
turnbull
disguised
as
a
burglar
at
the
same
time
rochester
learns
that
turnbull
has
been
caught
after
midnight
in
the
house
of
his
sweetheart
d
mn
you
kent
sprang
for
the
detective
throat
cut
out
your
abominable
insinuations
miss
mcintyre
shall
not
be
i
not
insulting
her
gasped
ferguson
half
strangled
let
go
kent
i
only
telling
you
what
that
half
crazy
partner
of
yours
rochester
was
probably
thinking
in
the
police
court
let
go
i
clymer
aided
the
detective
in
freeing
himself
sit
down
kent
he
said
sternly
ferguson
meant
no
offense
go
ahead
man
and
tell
us
the
rest
of
your
it
was
some
minutes
however
before
the
detective
had
collected
sufficient
breath
to
answer
intelligently
i
size
it
up
this
way
he
began
with
a
resentful
glance
at
kent
who
had
dropped
back
in
his
chair
again
rochester
knew
his
friend
had
heart
disease
and
that
his
sudden
death
would
be
attributed
to
it
so
he
took
a
sporting
chance
and
administered
a
fatal
dose
of
how
was
it
done
asked
clymer
just
slipped
the
poison
into
the
glass
of
water
he
handed
to
turnbull
in
the
court
room
explained
ferguson
and
glanced
in
triumph
at
kent
neat
was
it
kent
regarded
the
detective
his
mind
in
a
whirl
his
theory
was
certainly
plausible
but
have
you
other
evidence
to
prove
your
theory
he
asked
ferguson
checked
off
his
points
on
his
fingers
remember
how
insistent
rochester
was
that
turnbull
had
died
from
angina
pectoris
i
do
acknowledged
clymer
deeply
interested
continue
the
detective
needed
no
second
bidding
another
point
he
began
there
never
would
have
been
a
examination
if
miss
helen
mcintyre
had
asked
for
it
she
knew
of
the
between
the
men
and
suspected
foul
play
on
wait
commanded
kent
has
miss
mcintyre
substantiated
that
statement
not
yet
admitted
ferguson
i
stopped
at
her
house
but
the
butler
said
the
young
ladies
had
retired
and
could
not
see
any
kent
who
had
called
there
on
the
way
to
keep
his
dinner
engagement
with
clymer
had
been
met
with
the
same
statement
to
his
bitter
disappointment
he
most
earnestly
desired
to
see
the
twins
and
to
see
them
together
to
make
one
more
effort
to
induce
them
to
confide
in
him
for
that
they
had
some
secret
trouble
he
was
convinced
he
longed
to
be
of
aid
but
his
hands
were
tied
through
lack
of
information
do
imply
motives
to
miss
mcintyre
act
until
you
have
verified
them
ferguson
he
cautioned
go
on
with
your
one
moment
clymer
broke
into
the
conversation
did
rochester
tell
you
ferguson
that
he
had
recognized
turnbull
in
his
burglar
disguise
no
sir
i
never
had
an
opportunity
to
ask
him
for
he
disappeared
tuesday
night
and
has
not
been
seen
or
heard
of
since
ferguson
rejoined
hold
on
kent
checked
him
with
an
impatient
gesture
i
had
a
telegram
from
rochester
this
morning
stating
he
was
in
i
did
forget
about
the
telegram
retorted
ferguson
it
was
to
consult
you
about
that
that
i
hunted
you
up
that
telegram
was
what
kent
half
rose
from
his
chair
yes
after
the
inquest
i
called
cleveland
on
the
long
distance
talked
with
the
city
club
officials
and
with
police
headquarters
all
declared
that
rochester
was
not
there
and
no
trace
could
be
found
of
his
having
ever
arrived
in
the
clymer
laid
down
his
half
smoked
cigar
and
stared
at
the
detective
you
think
then
that
rochester
has
bolted
he
asked
it
looks
that
way
insisted
ferguson
how
about
it
kent
the
question
was
put
with
a
touch
of
arrogance
kent
did
not
reply
immediately
every
fact
that
ferguson
had
brought
out
fitted
the
situation
and
rochester
disappearance
added
color
to
the
detective
charges
why
was
he
hiding
unless
from
guilty
motives
and
where
had
he
gone
kent
shook
a
bewildered
head
it
is
plausible
he
conceded
but
after
all
only
circumstantial
well
circumstantial
evidence
is
good
enough
for
me
to
work
on
retorted
ferguson
on
discovering
that
the
telegram
from
cleveland
was
a
hoax
i
concluded
ferguson
might
be
lurking
around
washington
and
so
sent
a
description
of
him
to
the
different
precincts
and
secured
a
search
you
did
yes
armed
with
it
i
visited
rochester
apartment
but
find
a
clew
to
his
present
whereabouts
admitted
ferguson
so
then
i
went
to
your
office
kent
and
ransacked
the
firm
confound
you
kent
leaned
forward
in
his
wrath
and
shook
his
fist
at
the
detective
what
right
had
you
to
do
such
a
thing
the
search
warrant
covered
it
explained
ferguson
i
could
look
through
your
safe
kent
because
rochester
was
your
senior
partner
and
you
shared
the
office
together
i
was
within
the
perhaps
you
were
kent
controlled
his
anger
with
an
effort
but
i
had
told
you
i
did
not
know
rochester
whereabouts
before
i
showed
you
the
cleveland
telegram
which
you
claim
is
it
bogus
all
right
insisted
the
detective
i
thought
it
just
possible
i
might
find
some
paper
which
would
give
me
a
clew
to
rochester
hiding
place
so
i
went
through
the
how
did
you
get
it
open
asked
kent
i
found
it
kent
leapt
to
his
feet
you
found
it
open
he
stammered
why
man
i
locked
that
safe
securely
just
before
i
left
the
office
at
six
sure
absolutely
were
you
alone
yes
all
alone
sylvester
left
at
five
who
knew
the
combination
of
the
safe
only
rochester
and
it
was
ferguson
turn
to
spring
up
by
he
exclaimed
i
thought
the
electric
bulbs
in
the
office
felt
warm
as
if
they
had
recently
been
burning
rochester
must
have
been
there
just
before
it
would
seem
that
rochester
is
still
in
the
city
remarked
clymer
do
you
know
kent
whether
he
had
his
office
keys
with
him
i
presume
so
kent
slipped
his
hand
inside
his
pocket
and
took
out
a
bunch
of
keys
he
left
these
duplicates
in
his
desk
at
the
sure
they
are
duplicates
questioned
ferguson
and
kent
flushed
i
know
they
are
he
retorted
rochester
had
them
made
over
a
year
ago
as
a
matter
of
convenience
for
he
was
always
forgetting
his
keys
and
kept
these
at
our
he
a
queer
cuss
was
the
detective
only
comment
and
clymer
broke
into
the
conversation
did
you
find
any
address
or
paper
in
the
safe
which
might
prove
a
clew
ferguson
he
inquired
nothing
not
even
a
scrap
of
paper
and
the
detective
tone
was
glum
did
the
safe
look
as
if
its
contents
had
been
tumbled
about
asked
kent
no
everything
seemed
in
ferguson
thrust
his
hand
inside
his
coat
pocket
there
was
one
envelope
in
the
right
hand
compartment
which
puzzled
me
hold
on
was
that
compartment
also
unlocked
asked
kent
it
was
not
giving
kent
time
to
speak
again
ferguson
continued
his
remarks
as
this
was
unaddressed
i
brought
it
to
you
kent
to
ask
if
it
was
your
personal
property
he
drew
out
the
white
envelope
which
helen
mcintyre
had
brought
kent
that
morning
and
turned
it
over
so
that
both
men
could
see
the
large
red
seal
bearing
the
letter
it
is
my
property
asserted
kent
instantly
would
you
mind
opening
it
asked
ferguson
i
would
most
certainly
it
relates
to
my
personal
ferguson
looked
a
trifle
would
you
mind
telling
me
its
contents
kent
he
asked
persuasively
kent
regarded
the
detective
squarely
he
could
not
betray
helen
the
envelope
might
contain
harmless
nonsense
but
she
had
placed
it
in
his
no
confound
it
she
had
left
it
in
the
safe
for
rochester
and
rochester
was
apparently
a
fugitive
from
justice
while
circumstantial
evidence
pointed
to
his
having
poisoned
helen
lover
jimmie
if
you
must
know
ferguson
kent
spoke
with
deliberation
they
are
old
love
letters
of
clymer
glanced
down
at
the
envelope
which
the
detective
still
held
the
red
seal
making
a
distinct
blotch
of
color
on
the
white
glazed
surface
ah
kent
he
said
in
amusement
so
rumor
is
right
in
predicting
your
engagement
to
barbara
mcintyre
good
luck
to
you
through
the
open
doorway
to
the
dining
room
where
the
dancing
had
ceased
for
the
moment
came
a
soft
laugh
and
brewster
looked
in
at
them
mcintyre
standing
like
her
shadow
gazed
in
curiosity
over
her
shoulder
at
the
three
men
how
jolly
to
find
you
cooed
brewster
and
what
a
charming
retreat
it
much
too
nice
to
be
occupied
by
men
she
inclined
her
head
in
a
little
gracious
bow
to
ferguson
and
stepped
inside
have
my
chair
suggested
clymer
hospitably
as
the
pretty
widow
raised
her
lorgnette
and
scanned
the
oriental
hangings
and
lamps
and
lastly
the
white
envelope
which
lay
on
the
table
red
seal
uppermost
where
ferguson
had
placed
it
on
her
entrance
are
your
daughters
here
colonel
mcintyre
asked
kent
as
he
took
a
step
toward
the
table
mcintyre
answer
was
drowned
in
an
outburst
of
cheering
in
the
dining
room
and
the
rush
of
many
feet
on
common
impulse
kent
and
the
others
turned
toward
the
doorway
and
looked
inside
the
dining
room
two
officers
of
the
french
high
commission
were
being
held
on
the
shoulders
of
comrades
and
were
delivering
as
best
they
could
amidst
cheers
and
applause
their
farewell
to
hospitable
washington
as
his
companions
brushed
by
him
to
join
the
gay
throng
in
the
center
of
the
room
kent
turned
back
to
pick
up
the
envelope
he
had
left
lying
on
the
table
it
was
gone
in
feverish
haste
kent
looked
under
the
table
under
the
chairs
the
lounge
and
its
cushions
behind
the
draperies
and
even
under
the
rugs
which
covered
the
floor
of
the
porch
and
then
rose
and
stared
into
the
dining
room
which
one
of
his
companions
had
taken
the
envelope
outside
the
porch
the
beautiful
trumpet
vine
its
sturdy
trunk
and
thick
branches
reaching
almost
to
the
roof
of
the
club
building
rustled
as
in
a
high
wind
and
the
branches
swayed
this
way
and
that
as
a
figure
climbed
swiftly
down
from
the
porch
until
reaching
the
fence
separating
the
club
property
from
its
neighbor
the
man
swung
across
it
no
mean
athletic
feet
and
taking
advantage
of
each
sheltering
shadow
darted
into
the
alley
and
from
there
down
silent
deserted
nineteenth
street
chapter
xi
half
a
truth
dancing
was
being
resumed
in
the
dining
room
as
kent
appeared
again
in
the
doorway
and
he
made
his
way
as
quickly
as
possible
among
the
couples
going
into
all
the
rooms
on
that
floor
but
nowhere
could
he
find
detective
ferguson
on
emerging
from
the
drawing
room
he
encountered
the
steward
returning
from
downstairs
have
you
seen
clymer
he
asked
hurriedly
yes
kent
he
just
left
the
club
taking
detective
ferguson
with
him
in
his
motor
is
there
anything
i
can
do
added
the
steward
observing
kent
agitation
no
no
thanks
say
where
is
colonel
mcintyre
kent
gave
up
further
pursuit
of
the
detective
he
could
find
him
later
at
headquarters
the
steward
looked
among
the
dancers
i
do
see
him
he
said
but
there
is
brewster
dancing
in
the
front
room
the
colonel
must
be
somewhere
around
if
i
meet
him
kent
shall
i
tell
him
you
are
looking
for
him
i
will
be
greatly
obliged
if
you
will
do
so
replied
kent
and
straightening
his
tie
he
went
in
quest
of
the
pretty
widow
he
had
found
her
a
merry
in
the
past
possibly
he
could
gain
valuable
information
from
her
he
found
brewster
just
completing
her
dance
with
a
fine
looking
italian
officer
whose
broad
breast
bore
many
military
decorations
dance
the
encore
with
me
kent
could
be
very
persuasive
when
he
wished
and
brewster
dimpled
with
pleasure
but
there
was
a
faint
indecision
in
her
manner
which
he
was
quick
to
note
what
prompted
it
he
had
been
on
friendly
terms
with
her
in
fact
she
had
openly
championed
his
cause
so
barbara
had
once
told
him
when
colonel
mcintyre
had
made
caustic
remarks
about
his
frequent
calls
at
the
mcintyre
house
just
one
turn
she
said
as
the
foreigner
bowed
and
withdrew
i
am
feeling
a
little
weary
the
strain
of
the
inquest
she
added
in
explanation
perhaps
you
would
rather
sit
out
the
dance
he
suggested
there
is
an
alcove
in
that
window
oh
pshaw
as
a
man
and
a
girl
took
possession
of
the
chairs
never
mind
we
can
roost
on
the
stairs
brewster
preceded
him
to
the
staircase
leading
to
the
third
floor
and
sat
down
bracing
her
back
very
comfortably
against
the
railing
while
kent
seated
himself
at
her
feet
on
the
lower
step
extraordinary
developments
at
the
inquest
this
afternoon
he
began
as
she
volunteered
no
remark
to
think
of
jimmie
turnbull
being
poisoned
it
is
unbelievable
she
said
and
her
vehemence
was
a
surprise
to
kent
he
knew
her
as
all
froth
and
bubble
what
had
brought
the
dark
circles
under
her
eyes
and
the
unwonted
seriousness
in
her
manner
unbelievable
yes
he
agreed
gravely
but
true
the
autopsy
ended
all
you
mean
it
developed
doubt
she
corrected
and
a
sigh
accompanied
the
words
have
the
police
any
clew
to
the
guilty
man
i
do
know
i
sure
kent
spoke
with
caution
you
do
her
voice
was
a
little
sharp
did
detective
ferguson
give
you
any
news
when
talking
to
you
on
the
porch
so
you
recognized
the
detective
i
no
i
have
never
seen
him
before
she
nodded
gayly
to
an
acquaintance
passing
through
the
hall
colonel
mcintyre
told
me
his
name
it
was
so
odd
to
meet
a
man
here
not
in
evening
clothes
that
i
had
to
ask
who
he
ferguson
came
to
bring
me
some
papers
about
a
personal
matter
explained
kent
he
turned
so
as
to
face
her
did
you
see
a
white
envelope
lying
on
the
table
when
you
walked
out
on
the
porch
she
bowed
her
head
absently
her
foot
keeping
time
to
the
inspiring
music
played
by
the
orchestra
stationed
on
the
stair
landing
just
above
where
they
sat
you
left
it
lying
on
the
yes
so
i
did
replied
kent
and
i
believe
i
was
so
ungallant
as
to
bolt
into
the
dining
room
in
front
of
you
please
accept
my
behind
her
fan
which
she
used
with
languid
grace
the
widow
watched
him
we
all
bolted
together
she
responded
and
are
equally
guilty
of
what
questioned
a
voice
from
the
background
and
looking
up
kent
saw
colonel
mcintyre
standing
on
the
step
above
brewster
the
music
had
ceased
and
in
the
lull
their
conversation
had
been
distinctly
audible
guilty
of
curiosity
finished
the
widow
colonel
de
geofroy
farewell
speech
was
very
amusing
did
you
not
think
so
i
did
not
stay
to
hear
it
kent
confessed
i
had
to
return
to
the
porch
and
get
my
you
were
a
long
time
about
it
commented
mcintyre
sitting
down
by
brewster
and
possessing
himself
of
her
fan
i
waited
to
tell
you
that
helen
and
barbara
were
worn
out
after
the
inquest
and
so
stayed
at
home
but
you
did
show
neither
did
the
envelope
retorted
kent
and
as
his
companions
looked
at
him
he
added
it
had
disappeared
off
the
probably
blew
away
suggested
mcintyre
i
noticed
a
strong
current
of
air
from
the
dining
room
and
two
of
the
windows
inclosing
the
porch
were
open
that
hardly
possible
kent
replied
skeptically
the
envelope
weighed
at
least
two
ounces
it
would
have
taken
quite
a
gale
to
budge
mcintyre
turned
red
are
you
insinuating
that
one
of
us
walked
off
with
your
envelope
kent
he
demanded
angrily
brewster
stayed
him
as
he
was
about
to
rise
did
you
not
say
that
detective
ferguson
brought
you
the
envelope
kent
she
asked
then
what
more
likely
than
that
he
carried
it
off
again
she
smiled
amusedly
as
kent
expression
altered
why
not
ask
the
detective
her
suggestion
held
a
grain
of
truth
suppose
ferguson
had
not
believed
his
statement
that
the
papers
in
the
envelope
were
his
personal
property
and
had
taken
the
envelope
away
to
examine
it
at
his
leisure
the
thought
brought
kent
to
his
feet
good
night
sherlock
holmes
he
said
jestingly
i
follow
your
advice
there
was
no
opportunity
to
say
more
for
several
men
had
discovered
the
widow
perch
on
the
stairs
and
came
to
claim
their
dances
over
their
heads
mcintyre
watched
kent
stride
downstairs
then
stooping
over
he
picked
up
brewster
fan
and
sat
down
to
patiently
await
her
return
kent
pursuit
of
the
detective
took
longer
than
he
had
anticipated
and
it
was
after
midnight
before
he
finally
located
him
at
the
office
of
the
chief
of
detectives
in
the
district
building
i
called
for
the
envelope
you
took
from
my
safe
early
this
evening
he
began
without
preface
hardly
waiting
for
the
latter
surprised
greeting
why
kent
i
left
it
lying
on
the
porch
table
at
the
club
declared
ferguson
did
you
take
it
kent
worried
expression
returned
like
a
fool
i
forgot
the
envelope
when
that
cheering
broke
out
in
the
dining
room
and
rushed
to
find
out
what
it
was
about
when
i
returned
to
the
porch
the
envelope
was
gone
disappeared
questioned
ferguson
in
astonishment
disappeared
absolutely
i
searched
the
porch
thoroughly
and
find
a
trace
of
it
kent
explained
and
in
spite
of
contention
that
it
might
have
blown
out
of
the
window
i
am
certain
it
did
the
windows
were
open
and
i
recollect
there
was
a
strong
draught
remarked
ferguson
thoughtfully
but
not
sufficient
to
carry
away
that
kent
stepped
closer
did
you
observe
which
one
of
our
companions
stood
nearest
the
porch
table
ferguson
eyed
him
curiously
say
are
you
insinuating
that
one
of
those
people
took
your
envelope
a
subdued
whistle
escaped
ferguson
what
was
in
that
envelope
kent
he
demanded
to
make
it
of
any
value
to
that
bunch
and
as
kent
did
not
answer
immediately
he
added
are
you
sure
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
jimmie
turnbull
death
and
philip
rochester
disappearance
quite
kent
gaze
did
not
waver
before
his
penetrating
look
i
have
already
told
you
that
the
envelope
contained
old
love
letters
and
i
very
naturally
do
not
wish
them
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
colonel
mcintyre
the
father
of
the
girl
i
hope
to
ferguson
smiled
understandingly
i
see
from
what
i
know
of
colonel
mcintyre
there
a
very
narrow
nagging
spirit
concealed
under
his
frank
and
engaging
manner
i
wish
you
joy
of
your
future
and
he
chuckled
thanks
dryly
you
have
answered
my
question
as
to
who
stood
nearest
the
porch
table
the
detective
looked
thoughtful
we
all
stood
fairly
near
perhaps
brewster
was
a
shade
the
nearest
clymer
was
offering
her
a
chair
when
that
noise
came
from
the
dining
room
there
one
thing
i
am
willing
to
swear
to
his
manner
grew
more
earnest
that
envelope
was
still
lying
on
the
table
when
i
hustled
into
the
dining
well
who
was
the
last
person
to
leave
the
porch
kent
demanded
eagerly
i
do
know
was
the
disappointing
answer
i
reached
the
door
at
the
same
moment
you
did
and
passed
right
around
the
dining
room
to
get
a
view
of
what
was
going
on
i
thought
i
would
take
a
squint
at
the
tables
and
see
if
there
was
any
wine
being
used
he
admitted
but
there
was
nothing
doing
in
that
line
then
clymer
offered
to
bring
me
down
to
headquarters
and
i
left
the
club
with
kent
took
a
turn
about
the
room
did
clymer
go
to
the
cosmos
club
he
asked
pausing
by
the
detective
no
i
heard
him
tell
his
chauffeur
to
drive
to
the
saratoga
want
to
use
the
telephone
observing
kent
glance
stray
to
the
instrument
by
way
of
answer
kent
took
off
the
receiver
and
after
giving
a
number
to
central
he
recognized
clymer
voice
over
the
telephone
that
you
clymer
yes
well
this
is
kent
speaking
can
you
tell
me
who
was
the
last
person
to
leave
the
porch
when
colonel
de
geofroy
made
his
farewell
speech
at
the
club
i
was
came
clymer
surprised
answer
i
waited
for
mcintyre
to
pick
up
brewster
did
he
take
my
letter
off
the
table
also
called
kent
why
clymer
voice
testified
to
his
increased
surprise
mrs
brewster
dropped
her
fan
right
in
the
doorway
just
as
mcintyre
and
i
approached
we
both
stooped
to
get
it
and
like
fools
bumped
our
heads
together
in
the
act
he
got
the
fan
however
and
i
waited
for
him
to
walk
into
the
dining
room
before
following
as
you
passed
the
table
clymer
did
you
see
my
letter
lying
on
the
table
persisted
kent
upon
my
word
i
never
looked
at
the
table
clymer
hearty
tone
carried
conviction
i
walked
right
along
in
my
hurry
to
know
what
the
cheering
was
about
i
am
sorry
kent
have
you
mislaid
your
letter
yes
glumly
sorry
to
have
disturbed
you
clymer
good
night
and
clymer
echoing
good
night
sounded
faintly
as
he
hung
up
the
receiver
drew
blank
he
announced
turning
to
ferguson
confound
you
ferguson
you
had
no
right
to
touch
the
papers
in
my
safe
if
harm
comes
from
it
i
make
you
suffer
and
not
waiting
for
the
jumbled
apologies
and
explanations
he
hurried
from
the
building
but
once
on
the
sidewalk
he
paused
for
thought
mcintyre
must
have
picked
up
the
white
envelope
there
was
no
other
feasible
explanation
of
its
disappearance
but
what
had
attracted
his
attention
to
the
envelope
the
red
seal
with
the
big
letter
b
was
its
only
identifying
mark
if
helen
had
only
told
him
the
contents
of
the
envelope
kent
struck
his
clenched
fist
in
his
left
hand
in
wrath
something
must
be
done
he
could
not
stand
there
all
night
although
it
was
through
no
fault
of
his
own
that
he
had
lost
the
envelope
entrusted
to
his
care
he
was
still
responsible
to
helen
for
its
disappearance
she
must
be
told
that
it
was
gone
however
unpleasant
the
task
kent
walked
hastily
along
pennsylvania
avenue
until
he
came
to
a
drug
store
still
open
and
entered
the
telephone
booth
he
had
recollected
that
the
twins
had
a
branch
telephone
in
their
sitting
room
he
would
have
to
chance
their
being
awake
at
that
hour
barbara
mcintyre
turned
on
her
pillow
and
rubbed
her
sleepy
eyes
surely
she
had
been
mistaken
in
thinking
she
heard
the
telephone
bell
ringing
even
as
she
lay
striving
to
listen
she
dozed
off
again
to
be
rudely
awakened
by
helen
voice
at
her
ear
babs
came
the
agitated
whisper
the
envelope
gone
barbara
swung
out
of
bed
gone
where
father
has
downstairs
in
the
library
brewster
paused
on
her
entrance
by
the
side
of
a
piece
of
carved
venetian
furniture
and
laying
her
coronation
scarf
on
it
she
examined
a
white
envelope
the
red
seal
was
intact
at
the
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
she
raised
a
trap
door
in
the
piece
of
furniture
and
only
her
keen
ears
caught
the
faint
thud
of
the
envelope
as
it
dropped
inside
then
with
a
happy
tender
smile
she
turned
to
meet
colonel
mcintyre
chapter
xii
the
echo
of
a
laugh
colonel
mcintyre
tramped
the
deserted
dining
room
in
exasperation
nine
and
the
twins
had
not
come
to
breakfast
nor
was
there
any
evidence
that
brewster
intended
taking
that
meal
downstairs
will
you
wait
any
longer
sir
inquired
grimes
who
hovered
solicitously
in
the
background
i
afraid
sir
your
eggs
will
be
bring
them
along
directed
mcintyre
and
flung
himself
into
his
chair
at
the
foot
of
the
table
he
had
been
seated
but
a
few
minutes
when
barbara
appeared
and
dutifully
presented
her
cheek
to
be
kissed
then
she
tripped
lightly
to
helen
place
opposite
her
father
and
pressed
the
electric
bell
for
grimes
coffee
please
she
said
as
that
worthy
appeared
and
busied
herself
in
arranging
the
cups
and
saucers
helen
is
taking
her
breakfast
upstairs
she
explained
to
her
father
how
about
brewster
still
barbara
poured
out
her
father
coffee
with
careful
attention
to
detail
i
peeked
into
her
room
a
moment
ago
and
she
looked
so
i
had
the
heart
to
awaken
her
you
must
have
been
very
late
at
the
club
last
we
got
home
a
little
after
one
mcintyre
helped
himself
to
poached
eggs
and
bacon
what
did
you
do
last
night
went
to
bed
early
answered
barbara
with
brevity
helen
feeling
mcintyre
handsome
face
showed
concern
as
he
glanced
across
the
table
have
you
sent
for
stone
why
not
helen
i
we
barbara
stumbled
in
her
speech
we
have
taken
an
aversion
to
mcintyre
set
down
his
coffee
cup
with
unwonted
force
thereby
spilling
some
of
its
contents
what
he
exclaimed
in
complete
astonishment
and
regarded
her
fixedly
for
a
moment
his
tolerant
manner
which
he
frequently
assumed
toward
barbara
grew
stern
dr
stone
is
my
personal
friend
as
well
as
our
family
physician
and
a
cousin
of
margaret
brewster
put
in
barbara
mildly
well
what
of
it
trenchantly
aware
that
he
had
colored
at
mention
of
the
widow
name
nothing
barbara
eyes
opened
innocently
i
only
recalled
the
fact
of
his
relationship
as
you
enumerated
his
colonel
mcintyre
transferred
his
regard
from
her
to
the
butler
you
need
not
wait
he
remained
silent
until
the
servant
was
safely
in
the
pantry
and
then
addressed
his
daughter
none
of
your
tricks
barbara
he
cautioned
if
helen
is
ill
enough
to
require
medical
attention
stone
is
to
be
sent
for
regardless
of
your
sudden
dislike
to
him
for
which
by
the
way
you
have
given
no

i
barbara
folded
her
napkin
with
neat
exactness
it
pooh
mcintyre
gave
a
short
laugh
as
he
pushed
back
his
chair
going
to
see
helen
and
barbara
stopping
on
his
way
to
the
door
do
be
a
barbara
rubbed
the
tiny
mole
under
the
lobe
of
her
ear
a
trick
she
had
when
or
in
deep
thought
helen
she
announced
unaware
that
she
spoke
loud
shall
have
a
physician
but
it
wo
be
why
grimes
awakening
to
the
servant
noiseless
return
you
can
take
the
breakfast
dishes
did
miss
helen
eat
anything
not
very
much
grimes
shook
a
troubled
head
but
she
done
better
than
at
dinner
last
night
so
she
picking
up
and
do
you
be
worried
over
her
with
emphasis
as
he
sidled
nearer
tell
me
miss
is
the
colonel
courtin
brewster
ask
him
she
suggested
and
smiled
at
the
consternation
which
spread
over
the
butler
face
me
miss
he
exclaimed
in
horror
it
would
be
as
much
as
my
place
is
worth
the
colonel
that
why
miss
just
because
i
tidied
up
his
desk
and
put
his
papers
to
rights
he
flew
into
a
terrible
when
was
that
early
this
morning
miss
and
he
so
upset
thomas
miss
that
he
gave
oh
that
too
barbara
liked
the
second
man
perhaps
father
will
reconsider
and
persuade
him
to
the
butler
looked
unconvinced
it
was
about
the
police
dogs
he
confided
to
her
thomas
told
him
that
miss
helen
wanted
them
brought
back
and
the
colonel
swore
at
him
was
more
than
thomas
could
stand
and
he
ups
and
barbara
halted
half
way
to
the
door
did
thomas
get
the
dogs
you
wait
and
see
grimes
was
guilty
of
a
most
undignified
wink
thomas
ai
forgiven
himself
for
not
being
here
monday
night
miss
though
it
would
a
done
him
any
good
he
would
a
heard
turnbull
climbing
in
or
his
arrest
away
upstairs
in
the
servants
grimes
barbara
retracted
her
footsteps
and
placed
her
lips
very
close
to
the
old
servant
ear
when
i
came
in
on
tuesday
morning
i
found
the
door
to
the
attic
stairway
standing
partly
open
did
you
now
miss
the
two
regarded
each
other
warily
and
what
hour
may
that
have
been
the
butler
cocked
his
ear
for
her
answer
was
sometimes
a
little
hard
of
hearing
but
he
waited
in
vain
barbara
had
disappeared
inside
the
library
colonel
mcintyre
had
not
gone
at
once
to
see
his
daughter
helen
as
barbara
had
supposed
from
his
remark
instead
he
went
down
the
staircase
and
into
the
reception
room
on
the
ground
floor
it
was
generally
used
as
a
smoking
room
and
lounge
but
when
entertaining
was
done
cloaks
and
wraps
were
left
there
mcintyre
looked
over
the
prettily
upholstered
furniture
then
strolled
to
the
window
and
carefully
inspected
the
lock
it
appeared
in
perfect
order
as
he
tested
it
pushing
the
catch
back
as
far
as
it
would
go
he
raised
the
window
the
sash
moved
upward
without
a
sound
and
he
leaned
out
and
looked
up
and
down
the
path
which
ran
the
depth
of
the
house
to
the
kitchen
door
and
servants
entrance
there
was
an
iron
gate
separating
the
path
from
the
sidewalk
always
kept
locked
at
night
and
mcintyre
had
thought
that
sufficient
protection
and
had
not
put
an
iron
grille
in
the
window
mcintyre
closed
and
locked
the
window
then
pulling
out
the
gilt
chair
which
stood
in
front
of
the
desk
he
sat
down
selected
some
monogrammed
paper
and
penned
a
few
lines
in
his
characteristic
though
legible
writing
picking
up
some
red
sealing
wax
he
lighted
the
small
candle
in
its
brass
holder
which
matched
the
rest
of
the
desk
ornaments
but
before
heating
the
wax
he
looked
for
his
signet
ring
and
frowned
when
he
recalled
leaving
it
on
his
dresser
he
hesitated
a
moment
then
catching
sight
of
a
silver
seal
lying
at
the
back
of
the
desk
he
picked
it
up
and
moistened
the
initial
a
few
minutes
later
he
blew
out
the
candle
returned
the
wax
and
seal
to
a
pigeon
hole
and
carefully
placed
the
envelope
with
its
well
stamped
letter
b
in
his
coat
pocket
and
tramped
upstairs
helen
heard
his
heavy
tread
coming
down
the
hall
toward
her
room
and
scrambled
back
to
bed
she
had
but
time
to
arrange
her
dressing
sacque
when
her
father
walked
in
good
morning
my
dear
he
said
and
stooping
over
kissed
her
as
he
straightened
up
the
side
of
his
coat
turned
back
and
exposed
to
helen
bright
eyes
the
end
of
a
white
envelope
barbara
told
me
you
are
not
well
he
wheeled
forward
a
chair
and
sat
down
by
the
bed
had
i
better
send
for
stone
oh
no
her
reply
though
somewhat
faint
was
emphatic
and
he
frowned
why
not
aggressively
i
trust
you
do
not
share
barbara
suddenly
developed
prejudice
against
the
good
i
do
not
require
a
physician
she
said
evasively
i
am
mcintyre
regarded
her
vexedly
he
could
not
decide
whether
her
flushed
cheeks
were
from
fever
or
the
result
of
exertion
or
excitement
excitement
over
what
he
looked
about
the
room
it
reflected
the
taste
of
its
dainty
owner
in
its
furnishings
but
nowhere
did
he
find
an
answer
to
his
unspoken
question
until
his
eye
lighted
on
a
box
of
rouge
under
the
electric
lamp
on
her
bed
stand
do
use
that
he
said
touching
the
box
you
know
i
detest
oh
that
she
turned
to
see
what
he
was
talking
about
that
rouge
belongs
to
margaret
mcintyre
promptly
changed
the
conversation
have
you
had
your
breakfast
he
asked
yes
grimes
took
the
tray
down
some
time
helen
watched
her
father
fidget
with
his
watch
fob
for
several
minutes
then
asked
with
characteristic
directness
what
do
you
wish
to
see
that
you
have
proper
medical
attention
if
you
are
ill
he
returned
promptly
how
would
a
week
or
ten
days
at
atlantic
city
suit
you
and
barbara
not
at
helen
sat
up
from
her
reclining
position
on
the
pillows
you
forget
father
that
we
have
a
margaret
brewster
is
not
leaving
until
i
had
not
forgotten
curtly
i
propose
that
she
go
with
a
faint
oh
escaped
helen
otherwise
she
made
no
comment
and
mcintyre
after
contemplating
her
for
a
minute
looked
away
either
go
to
atlantic
city
with
us
helen
or
resume
your
normal
everyday
life
he
said
shortly
i
am
tired
of
heroics
jimmie
turnbull
was
hardly
the
man
to
inspire
stop
helen
voice
rang
out
imperiously
i
will
not
permit
one
word
said
in
disparagement
of
jimmie
least
of
all
from
you
father
wait
as
he
attempted
to
speak
i
do
not
know
what
traits
of
character
i
may
have
inherited
from
you
but
i
have
all
mother
loyalty
and
that
loyalty
belongs
to
mcintyre
eyes
shifted
under
her
gaze
i
regret
very
much
this
obsession
he
said
rising
i
will
not
attempt
to
reason
with
you
again
helen
but
he
made
no
effort
to
lower
his
voice
the
world
our
world
will
soon
know
what
manner
of
man
james
turnbull
was
of
that
i
am
and
i
helen
faced
her
father
proudly
i
will
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
defend
his
her
father
wheeled
about
in
doing
so
see
that
you
do
not
compromise
yourself
he
remarked
coldly
and
before
the
infuriated
girl
could
answer
he
slammed
the
door
shut
and
stalked
downstairs
some
half
hour
later
he
opened
the
door
of
rochester
and
kent
law
office
and
would
have
walked
unceremoniously
into
kent
private
office
had
not
john
sylvester
stepped
forward
from
behind
his
desk
in
the
corner
good
morning
colonel
he
said
civilly
mr
kent
is
not
here
do
you
wish
to
leave
any
message
oh
good
morning
sylvester
mcintyre
manner
was
brusque
when
do
you
expect
kent
in
about
twenty
minutes
sylvester
glanced
at
the
wall
clock
wo
you
sit
down
mcintyre
took
the
chair
and
planted
it
by
the
window
never
a
very
patient
man
he
waited
for
kent
with
increasing
irritation
and
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
his
temper
was
uppermost
give
me
something
to
write
with
he
demanded
of
sylvester
accepting
the
clerk
fountain
pen
without
thanks
he
walked
over
to
the
center
table
and
drawing
out
his
leather
wallet
took
from
it
a
visiting
card
and
stooping
over
wrote
you
have
but
hours
remaining
mcintyre
see
that
kent
gets
this
card
he
directed
no
do
put
it
there
irascibly
as
the
clerk
laid
the
card
on
top
of
a
pile
of
letters
take
it
into
kent
office
and
put
it
on
his
there
was
that
about
colonel
mcintyre
which
inspired
complete
obedience
to
his
wishes
and
sylvester
followed
his
directions
without
further
question
as
the
clerk
stepped
into
kent
office
mcintyre
saw
a
woman
sitting
by
the
empty
desk
she
turned
her
head
on
hearing
footsteps
and
their
glances
met
a
faint
exclamation
broke
from
her
margaret
mcintyre
strode
past
sylvester
what
are
you
doing
here
brewster
ready
laugh
hid
all
sign
of
embarrassment
must
you
know
she
asked
archly
that
is
hardly
fair
to
so
barbara
sent
you
here
with
a
message
brewster
treated
his
remark
as
a
statement
and
not
a
question
and
briskly
changed
the
subject
i
ca
wait
any
longer
she
pouted
please
tell
kent
that
i
am
sorry
not
to
have
seen
i
will
sylvester
placed
mcintyre
card
in
the
center
of
kent
desk
and
flew
to
open
the
door
for
brewster
as
the
widow
stepped
into
the
corridor
she
brushed
by
an
woman
whose
cheap
finery
gave
clear
indication
of
her
tastes
hardly
noticing
another
presence
she
turned
and
took
mcintyre
arm
and
they
strolled
off
together
her
soft
laugh
floating
back
to
where
sylvester
stood
talking
to
her
husband
chapter
xiii
the
face
at
the
window
harry
kent
rang
the
doorbell
at
the
mcintyre
residence
for
the
fifth
time
and
wondered
what
had
become
of
the
faithful
grimes
the
butler
was
usually
the
soul
of
promptness
and
to
keep
a
caller
waiting
on
the
doorstep
would
in
his
category
rank
as
the
height
of
impropriety
as
kent
again
raised
his
hand
toward
the
bell
the
door
swung
open
suddenly
and
barbara
beckoned
to
him
to
come
inside
the
bell
is
out
of
order
she
explained
i
saw
you
from
the
window
hurry
and
grimes
wo
know
that
you
are
here
and
she
darted
ahead
of
him
into
the
reception
room
kent
followed
more
slowly
he
was
hurt
that
she
had
had
no
other
greeting
for
him
babs
are
you
glad
to
see
me
he
asked
wistfully
for
an
instant
her
eyes
were
lighted
by
her
old
sunny
smile
you
know
i
am
she
whispered
softly
as
his
arms
closed
around
her
and
their
lips
met
in
a
tender
kiss
she
added
fervently
oh
harry
why
did
you
make
me
marry
you
in
the
happy
bygone
days
i
asked
you
often
enough
he
declared
will
you
go
with
me
to
rockville
at
once
her
face
changed
and
she
drew
back
from
him
no
she
said
it
is
selfish
of
me
to
think
of
my
own
happiness
how
about
mine
demanded
kent
with
warmth
if
you
wo
consider
yourself
consider
i
she
looked
out
of
the
window
to
conceal
sudden
blinding
tears
there
was
a
hint
of
hidden
tragedy
in
her
lovely
face
which
went
to
kent
heart
sweetheart
his
voice
was
very
tender
is
there
nothing
i
can
do
for
you
nothing
she
shook
her
head
drearily
this
family
must
its
weir
kent
studied
her
in
silence
that
she
was
in
deadly
earnest
he
recognized
she
was
no
hysterical
fool
or
given
to
sentimental
twaddle
you
came
to
me
on
wednesday
to
ask
my
aid
in
solving
jimmie
death
he
said
i
have
learned
certain
facts
barbara
sprang
to
her
feet
wait
she
cautioned
let
me
close
the
door
now
go
on
with
her
customary
impetuosity
she
reseated
herself
before
i
do
so
i
must
tell
you
babs
that
i
recognized
the
fraud
you
and
helen
perpetrated
at
the
coroner
inquest
yesterday
fraud
yes
quietly
i
am
aware
that
you
impersonated
helen
on
the
witness
stand
and
vice
versa
you
took
a
frightful
i
do
see
why
she
protested
in
my
testimony
i
told
nothing
but
the
i
never
doubted
you
told
the
truth
regarding
the
events
of
monday
night
as
you
saw
them
but
the
coroner
questions
were
put
to
you
under
the
impression
that
you
were
kent
scrutinized
her
keenly
would
helen
have
been
able
to
give
the
same
answers
that
you
did
without
perjuring
herself
barbara
started
and
her
face
paled
are
you
insinuating
that
helen
killed
jimmie
she
cried
no
his
emphatic
denial
was
prompt
but
i
do
believe
that
she
knows
more
of
what
transpired
monday
night
than
she
is
willing
to
admit
is
that
not
so
barbara
yes
she
acknowledged
reluctantly
does
she
know
who
poisoned
jimmie
no
no
barbara
rested
a
firm
hand
on
his
shoulder
i
swear
helen
does
not
know
you
must
believe
me
she
may
not
know
kent
spoke
slowly
but
are
you
sure
she
does
not
suspect
some
one
well
what
if
i
do
asked
helen
quietly
and
kent
looking
around
found
her
standing
just
inside
the
door
her
entrance
had
been
noiseless
you
should
tell
the
authorities
kent
rose
as
she
passed
him
and
selected
a
seat
which
brought
her
face
somewhat
in
shadow
if
you
do
not
you
may
retard
but
if
i
speak
i
may
involve
the
innocent
she
retorted
i
her
eyes
shifted
from
him
to
barbara
and
back
again
i
can
not
undertake
that
better
that
than
let
the
guilty
escape
through
your
silence
protested
kent
possibly
the
theories
of
the
police
may
coincide
with
yours
what
are
they
asked
barbara
impetuously
kent
considered
before
replying
if
detective
ferguson
had
gone
so
far
as
to
secure
a
search
warrant
to
go
through
rochester
apartment
and
office
it
would
not
be
long
before
the
fact
of
his
being
a
suspect
would
be
common
property
there
could
therefore
be
no
harm
in
his
repeating
ferguson
conversation
to
the
twins
in
fact
as
their
legal
representative
they
were
entitled
to
know
the
latest
developments
from
him
detective
ferguson
believes
that
the
poison
was
administered
by
philip
rochester
he
said
finally
and
watched
to
see
how
the
announcement
would
affect
them
barbara
eyes
opened
to
their
widest
extent
and
back
in
her
corner
into
which
she
had
gradually
edged
her
chair
helen
emitted
a
long
long
breath
as
her
taut
muscles
relaxed
what
makes
ferguson
think
philip
guilty
demanded
barbara
it
is
known
that
he
and
jimmie
were
not
on
good
terms
replied
kent
then
rochester
disappearance
after
jimmie
death
lends
color
to
the
has
philip
really
disappeared
asked
helen
you
showed
me
a
telegram
apparently
the
telegram
was
a
fake
admitted
kent
the
cleveland
police
report
that
he
is
not
at
the
address
given
in
the
but
who
could
have
an
object
in
sending
such
a
telegram
asked
barbara
slowly
rochester
in
the
hope
of
throwing
the
police
off
his
track
if
he
really
killed
kent
looked
straight
at
helen
it
was
while
searching
our
office
safe
for
trace
of
rochester
present
address
that
ferguson
obtained
possession
of
your
sealed
helen
plucked
nervously
at
the
ribbon
on
her
gown
did
the
detective
open
the
envelope
she
asked
are
you
sure
positive
the
red
seal
was
tell
us
how
the
envelope
came
to
be
stolen
from
you
coaxed
barbara
we
were
in
the
little
smoking
porch
off
the
dining
room
at
the
club
de
barbara
smiled
her
remembrance
of
it
and
motioned
kent
to
continue
ferguson
had
just
put
down
the
envelope
on
the
table
and
i
started
to
pick
it
up
when
cheering
in
the
dining
room
distracted
my
attention
and
i
with
the
others
went
to
see
what
it
was
about
when
i
returned
to
the
porch
the
envelope
was
no
longer
on
the
who
were
with
you
questioned
helen
your
father
brewster
of
course
murmured
barbara
go
on
detective
ferguson
and
ben
glymer
barbara
made
a
wry
face
and
went
on
kent
not
heeding
her
each
of
these
persons
deny
any
further
knowledge
of
the
envelope
except
they
declare
it
was
lying
on
the
table
when
we
all
made
a
dash
for
the
dining
room
who
was
the
last
to
leave
the
porch
asked
helen
ben
and
he
saw
no
one
take
the
envelope
he
declares
that
he
had
his
back
to
the
table
part
of
the
time
but
to
the
best
of
his
knowledge
no
one
took
the
one
of
them
must
have
insisted
barbara
the
envelope
had
legs
or
one
of
them
did
take
it
agreed
kent
but
which
one
is
the
question
frankly
to
find
the
answer
i
must
know
the
contents
of
the
envelope
why
because
then
i
will
have
some
idea
who
would
be
enough
interested
in
the
envelope
to
steal
helen
considered
him
long
and
thoughtfully
i
can
not
answer
your
question
she
announced
finally
she
saw
his
face
harden
and
hastened
to
explain
not
through
any
lack
of
confidence
in
you
harry
she
stumbled
in
her
speech
i
i
do
not
know
what
the
envelope
kent
stared
at
her
then
who
requested
you
to
lock
the
envelope
in
rochester
safe
he
demanded
and
receiving
no
reply
asked
suddenly
was
it
rochester
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
tell
you
she
responded
her
mouth
set
in
obstinate
lines
and
before
he
could
press
his
request
a
second
time
she
asked
philip
rochester
defended
jimmie
in
court
when
every
one
thought
him
a
burglar
why
then
should
philip
have
picked
him
out
to
attack
he
is
not
a
homicidal
maniac
no
but
the
police
contend
that
rochester
recognized
jimmie
in
his
and
decided
to
kill
him
hoping
his
death
would
be
attributed
to
angina
pectoris
and
no
held
wound
up
kent
i
don
t
quite
understand
helen
raised
her
handkerchief
to
her
forehead
and
removed
a
drop
of
moisture
how
did
philip
kill
jimmie
there
in
court
before
us
all
ferguson
believes
that
he
put
the
dose
of
aconitine
in
the
glass
of
water
which
jimmie
asked
for
explained
kent
and
would
have
continued
his
remarks
but
a
scream
from
barbara
startled
him
there
look
at
the
window
she
cried
i
saw
a
face
peering
in
look
quick
harry
look
kent
needed
no
second
bidding
but
although
he
craned
his
head
far
outside
the
open
window
and
gazed
both
up
and
down
the
street
and
along
the
path
to
the
kitchen
door
he
failed
to
see
any
one
was
it
a
man
or
woman
he
asked
turning
back
to
the
room
i
i
could
tell
it
was
just
a
barbara
stood
resting
one
hand
on
the
table
her
weight
leaning
upon
it
not
for
words
would
she
have
had
kent
know
that
her
knees
were
shaking
under
her
did
you
see
the
face
helen
as
he
put
the
question
kent
looked
around
at
the
silent
girl
in
the
corner
she
had
slipped
back
in
her
chair
and
with
closed
eyes
lay
and
limp
with
a
leap
kent
gained
her
side
and
his
hand
sought
her
pulse
ring
for
brandy
and
water
he
directed
as
barbara
came
to
his
aid
helen
has
twenty
minutes
later
kent
hastened
out
of
the
mcintyre
house
and
turning
into
connecticut
avenue
boarded
a
street
car
headed
south
after
carrying
helen
to
the
twins
sitting
room
he
had
assisted
barbara
in
reviving
her
he
had
wondered
at
the
time
why
barbara
had
not
summoned
the
servants
then
concluded
that
neither
sister
wished
a
scene
that
helen
was
worse
than
she
would
admit
he
appreciated
and
advised
barbara
to
send
for
stone
the
suggestion
had
apparently
fallen
on
deaf
ears
for
no
physician
had
appeared
during
the
time
he
was
in
the
house
nor
had
barbara
used
the
telephone
almost
at
her
elbow
as
she
sat
by
her
sister
couch
to
summon
stone
kent
had
only
waited
long
enough
to
convince
himself
that
helen
was
out
of
danger
and
then
had
departed
it
was
nearly
one
when
he
finally
stepped
inside
his
office
and
he
found
his
clerk
and
a
dressy
female
bending
eagerly
over
a
newspaper
they
looked
up
at
his
approach
and
sylvester
came
forward
this
is
my
wife
sir
he
explained
and
kent
bowed
courteously
to
sylvester
we
were
just
reading
this
account
of
disappearance
it
dreadful
sir
to
think
that
the
police
believe
him
guilty
of
turnbull
dreadful
indeed
agreed
kent
the
news
had
been
published
even
sooner
than
he
had
imagined
what
paper
is
that
the
noon
edition
of
the
sylvester
handed
it
to
him
thanks
kent
flung
down
his
hat
and
spread
open
the
paper
who
have
been
here
colonel
mcintyre
sir
he
left
a
card
for
sylvester
hurried
into
kent
office
to
return
a
moment
later
with
a
visiting
card
he
left
this
sir
for
you
with
most
particular
directions
that
it
be
handed
to
you
at
once
on
your
kent
read
the
curt
message
on
the
card
without
comment
and
tore
the
into
tiny
bits
any
one
else
been
in
this
morning
he
asked
yes
sylvester
consulted
a
written
memorandum
mr
black
called
also
colonel
thorne
senator
harris
and
mrs
brewster
the
newspaper
slipped
from
kent
fingers
in
his
astonishment
what
did
she
want
here
to
see
you
sir
so
she
said
but
she
first
asked
for
rochester
explained
sylvester
stooping
over
to
pick
up
the
inside
sheet
of
the
times
which
had
separated
from
the
others
i
told
her
that
rochester
was
unavoidably
detained
in
cleveland
then
she
said
she
would
consult
you
and
i
let
her
wait
in
your
office
for
the
good
part
of
an
kent
thought
a
moment
then
walked
toward
his
door
on
its
threshold
he
paused
struck
by
a
sudden
idea
did
colonel
mcintyre
come
with
brewster
he
asked
no
kent
he
came
in
while
she
was
and
they
went
off
together
volunteered
sylvester
who
had
been
a
silent
listener
to
their
conversation
kent
started
he
had
forgotten
the
woman
excuse
me
kent
she
continued
and
stepped
toward
him
i
presume
likely
that
you
are
very
interested
in
this
charge
of
murder
against
your
partner
i
am
affirmed
kent
as
sylvester
paused
i
am
too
sir
she
confided
to
him
cause
you
see
i
was
in
the
court
room
when
turnbull
died
and
i
naturally
naturally
agreed
kent
with
a
commiserating
glance
at
his
clerk
the
latter
wife
threatened
to
be
loquacious
and
he
judged
from
her
looks
that
it
was
a
habit
which
had
grown
with
the
years
as
a
general
rule
he
abhorred
talkative
women
but
and
what
took
you
to
the
police
court
on
tuesday
morning
why
me
and
sylvester
have
our
little
differences
like
other
married
couples
she
explained
and
sometimes
we
ask
the
court
to
settle
she
caught
kent
look
of
impatience
and
hurried
her
speech
the
burglar
case
came
on
just
after
ours
was
remanded
and
seeing
the
mcintyre
twins
whom
i
often
read
about
i
just
thought
i
stay
let
me
have
that
paper
a
certainly
kent
gave
her
the
newspaper
and
she
ran
her
finger
down
the
columns
devoted
to
the
turnbull
case
with
a
slowness
that
set
his
already
excited
nerves
on
edge
here
what
i
looking
for
she
exclaimed
triumphantly
a
minute
later
and
pointed
to
the
paragraph
mrs
margaret
perry
brewster
the
fascinating
widow
added
nothing
material
to
the
case
in
her
testimony
and
she
was
quickly
excused
after
stating
that
she
was
told
about
the
tragedy
by
the
mcintyre
twins
upon
their
return
from
the
police
well
what
of
it
asked
kent
only
this
kent
sylvester
enjoyed
nothing
so
much
as
talking
to
a
good
looking
man
especially
in
the
presence
of
her
husband
and
she
could
not
refrain
from
a
triumphant
look
at
him
as
she
went
on
with
her
remarks
there
was
a
female
sitting
on
the
bench
next
to
me
in
court
in
fact
she
and
i
were
the
only
women
on
that
side
and
i
kinder
noticed
her
on
that
account
and
then
i
saw
she
was
all
done
up
in
veils
i
could
see
her
face
i
caught
her
peering
this
way
and
that
during
the
burglar
hearing
i
do
reckon
she
could
see
well
through
all
the
veils
now
do
get
impatient
kent
i
getting
to
my
point
that
woman
sitting
next
to
me
in
the
police
court
was
the
widow
what
kent
laughed
unbelievingly
oh
come
you
are
i
am
not
sylvester
spoke
with
conviction
now
why
does
brewster
declare
at
the
coroner
inquest
that
she
only
heard
of
the
turnbull
tragedy
from
the
mcintyre
twins
on
their
return
home
you
must
be
mistaken
argued
kent
why
you
admit
yourself
that
the
woman
was
so
swathed
in
veils
that
you
could
not
see
her
no
but
i
heard
her
laugh
in
court
sylvester
spoke
in
deep
earnestness
and
kent
placed
faith
in
her
statement
in
spite
of
his
outward
skepticism
and
i
heard
her
laugh
in
this
corridor
this
morning
and
i
placed
her
as
the
same
woman
i
asked
sylvester
who
she
was
and
he
told
me
i
been
reading
this
account
of
the
turnbull
inquest
and
i
recollected
seeing
brewster
name
and
my
husband
and
i
were
just
reading
the
account
over
when
you
came
kent
gazed
in
perplexity
at
sylvester
why
did
brewster
laugh
in
the
police
court
he
asked
when
stone
exclaimed
to
the
deputy
marshal
prisoner
appears
ill
declared
sylvester
she
enjoyed
the
dramatic
and
that
kent
was
hanging
on
her
words
she
was
fully
aware
in
spite
of
his
expressionless
face
dr
stone
lifted
the
burglar
in
his
arms
and
then
brewster
laughed
as
she
laughed
in
the
corridor
a
soft
gurgling
chapter
xiv
pay
cash
it
was
the
rush
hour
at
the
metropolis
trust
company
and
the
busy
paying
teller
counted
out
silver
and
gold
and
treasury
notes
of
varying
denominations
with
the
mechanical
precision
and
exactness
which
experience
gives
suddenly
his
hand
stopped
midway
toward
the
money
drawer
his
attention
arrested
by
the
signature
on
a
check
a
swift
glance
upward
showed
him
a
girl
face
at
the
grille
of
the
window
there
was
an
instant
pause
then
she
addressed
him
do
hurry
mcdonald
father
is
waiting
for
pardon
me
miss
he
stamped
the
check
and
laid
it
to
one
side
how
do
you
want
the
money
oh
i
she
glanced
at
a
memorandum
on
the
back
of
an
envelope
mrs
brewster
wishes
ten
tens
five
twenties
and
ten
ones
thank
you
good
afternoon
and
counting
over
the
money
she
thrust
it
inside
her
bag
and
hurried
away
she
had
been
gone
a
bare
five
minutes
when
kent
reached
the
window
and
pushed
several
checks
toward
the
teller
is
clymer
in
his
office
mcdonald
he
asked
placing
the
bank
notes
given
him
in
his
wallet
i
not
the
teller
glanced
around
at
the
clock
the
hands
stood
at
ten
minutes
of
three
it
pretty
near
closing
time
kent
still
he
may
be
i
go
and
see
and
with
a
nod
of
farewell
kent
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
off
in
the
direction
of
the
office
of
the
bank
president
on
reaching
there
he
saw
through
the
glass
partition
of
the
door
clymer
seated
in
earnest
conclave
with
two
men
happening
to
glance
up
clymer
recognized
kent
and
beckoned
to
him
to
come
inside
you
know
taylor
he
said
by
way
of
introduction
and
this
is
harding
of
new
york
kent
he
turned
around
in
his
swivel
chair
to
face
the
three
men
draw
up
a
chair
kent
we
were
just
going
over
to
see
you
yes
kent
looked
inquiringly
at
the
bank
president
the
gravity
of
his
manner
betokened
serious
tidings
what
is
it
clymer
clymer
did
not
reply
at
once
it
this
he
said
finally
with
blunt
directness
your
partner
philip
rochester
appears
to
be
a
bankrupt
harding
and
taylor
came
in
here
to
attach
his
private
bank
account
to
cover
indebtedness
to
their
business
an
exclamation
broke
from
kent
impossible
he
gasped
i
would
have
said
the
same
this
morning
declared
clymer
but
on
investigation
i
find
that
rochester
has
his
account
here
for
a
large
amount
and
borrowed
heavily
the
further
i
look
into
his
financial
affairs
the
more
involved
i
find
but
kent
was
i
know
for
an
absolute
fact
that
rochester
was
paid
some
exceedingly
large
fees
last
week
totaling
over
fifty
thousand
he
has
never
deposited
such
a
sum
or
anywhere
like
that
amount
in
this
bank
either
last
week
or
this
stated
clymer
running
his
eyes
down
a
bank
statement
which
with
several
pass
books
lay
on
his
desk
does
he
carry
accounts
at
other
banks
inquired
harding
not
that
i
can
discover
responded
taylor
i
have
been
to
every
national
and
private
banking
house
in
washington
but
all
deny
having
him
as
a
depositor
did
rochester
ever
bank
out
of
town
kent
not
to
my
kent
drew
out
a
bank
book
here
is
the
balance
clymer
we
bank
here
you
clymer
look
of
anxiety
deepened
did
you
see
mcdonald
as
you
came
in
yes
he
cashed
some
checks
for
your
personal
checks
kent
looked
questioningly
at
clymer
what
do
you
mean
only
this
that
all
moneys
deposited
here
in
the
firm
name
of
rochester
and
kent
have
been
drawn
that
not
possible
kent
started
up
checks
on
that
account
must
bear
both
rochester
signature
and
checks
bearing
both
signatures
have
been
presented
for
the
total
sum
deposited
to
your
credit
stated
clymer
and
he
picked
up
four
canceled
checks
see
for
kent
stared
at
the
checks
in
dumbfounded
silence
then
carrying
them
to
the
light
he
examined
them
with
minute
care
before
bringing
them
back
to
the
bank
president
this
is
the
first
i
have
heard
of
these
transactions
he
said
you
mean
that
the
signatures
are
clever
his
statement
was
heard
with
gravity
taylor
exchanged
a
meaning
look
with
the
new
yorker
you
mean
your
signature
is
a
forgery
he
suggested
rochester
had
a
peculiar
gift
of
kent
sprang
up
do
you
accuse
philip
rochester
of
signing
these
checks
and
inserting
my
name
to
them
i
do
calmly
i
am
not
familiar
with
your
signature
kent
but
that
rochester
wrote
the
body
of
those
four
checks
and
put
his
own
signature
at
the
bottom
i
will
swear
to
in
any
court
of
law
to
make
them
valid
he
had
to
add
your
but
d
mn
it
man
kent
stared
in
bewilderment
at
his
three
companions
rochester
was
honorable
and
and
addicted
to
drink
put
in
harding
but
not
a
forger
retorted
kent
firmly
harding
only
rejoinder
was
a
skeptical
smile
as
he
turned
to
address
clymer
so
rochester
not
only
has
taken
his
own
money
but
withdrawn
that
belonging
to
the
firm
of
rochester
and
kent
without
the
knowledge
of
his
junior
partner
it
looks
black
clymer
he
remarked
especially
when
taken
in
consideration
with
his
other
involved
financial
where
will
we
find
rochester
kent
asked
taylor
before
the
bank
president
could
answer
the
new
yorker
kent
paused
in
indecision
what
reply
could
he
make
without
further
involving
rochester
in
trouble
he
had
not
the
faintest
idea
where
rochester
was
but
to
state
that
he
was
missing
could
not
but
add
to
the
belief
that
he
had
made
away
with
all
the
money
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
the
noon
edition
of
the
times
had
hinted
at
disappearance
but
had
stated
they
could
not
get
the
statement
confirmed
from
police
headquarters
obviously
harding
and
taylor
had
not
seen
the
newspaper
was
it
just
to
the
men
before
him
to
keep
them
in
the
dark
if
their
claims
were
true
and
kent
never
doubted
that
they
were
they
had
already
lost
money
through
rochester
extraordinary
behavior
kent
turned
sick
at
the
thought
of
his
own
loss
his
savings
swept
away
would
barbara
wait
for
him
was
it
fair
to
ask
her
taylor
broke
the
prolonged
silence
i
met
detective
ferguson
on
my
way
here
he
stated
he
told
me
that
the
police
were
looking
for
what
harding
looked
up
startled
why
did
you
inform
me
of
that
well
i
thought
we
better
hear
from
clymer
the
true
state
of
rochester
finances
responded
taylor
i
never
anticipated
such
facts
as
he
has
given
but
if
you
knew
the
police
were
after
rochester
objected
harding
clymer
broke
into
the
conversation
there
was
a
heavy
frown
on
his
usually
placid
countenance
i
judged
from
detective
confidences
to
us
kent
at
the
club
de
vingt
that
he
was
wanted
by
the
police
in
connection
with
the
turnbull
tragedy
but
the
facts
brought
out
through
harding
action
to
attach
rochester
bank
account
puts
a
different
construction
on
rochester
what
had
rochester
to
do
with
jimmie
turnbull
questioned
harding
before
kent
could
answer
clymer
they
lived
together
he
replied
shortly
and
one
dies
and
the
other
disappears
harding
whistled
dolefully
was
turnbull
an
official
of
this
bank
clymer
yes
our
were
his
affairs
involved
not
in
the
least
clymer
spoke
with
emphasis
a
most
honorable
fellow
jimmie
turnbull
his
murder
was
a
shocking
have
the
police
found
any
motive
for
the
crime
kent
asked
taylor
i
believe
harding
who
had
been
ruminating
in
silence
leaned
forward
his
expression
alight
with
a
sudden
idea
could
it
be
that
turnbull
found
out
that
rochester
was
passing
forged
checks
and
rochester
insured
his
silence
by
poisoning
him
he
asked
clymer
and
kent
exchanged
glances
as
kent
thoughts
reverted
to
the
forged
letter
presented
by
turnbull
to
the
bank
treasurer
whereby
he
had
been
given
mcintyre
valuable
negotiable
securities
could
it
be
that
rochester
had
written
the
letter
given
it
to
his
turnbull
and
the
latter
thinking
it
genuine
had
secured
the
mcintyre
securities
and
handed
them
over
to
rochester
the
idea
took
breath
away
and
yet
the
more
he
contemplated
it
the
more
feasible
it
appeared
what
the
date
on
those
checks
demanded
kent
tuesday
of
this
week
the
day
jimmie
turnbull
clymer
turned
them
over
they
are
drawn
payable
to
cash
and
bear
no
endorsement
which
shows
rochester
must
have
presented
them
harding
and
taylor
glanced
significantly
at
each
other
but
neither
spoke
suddenly
kent
pushed
back
his
chair
and
rose
without
ceremony
do
go
clymer
took
up
some
papers
there
a
matter
it
will
kent
mouth
was
set
and
determined
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
that
all
rochester
honest
debts
will
be
paid
by
the
firm
if
necessary
i
will
obligate
myself
to
that
extent
he
paused
as
for
you
fellows
turning
to
harding
and
taylor
who
had
also
risen
give
me
hours
what
for
they
chorused
to
locate
philip
rochester
and
waiting
for
no
answer
kent
bolted
out
of
the
office
chapter
xv
when
the
light
failed
the
city
lights
were
springing
up
block
after
block
along
pennsylvania
avenue
as
detective
ferguson
left
that
busy
thoroughfare
and
hurried
to
the
saratoga
he
stepped
inside
the
lobby
of
the
apartment
house
a
full
minute
before
his
appointment
with
its
manager
and
went
at
once
to
look
him
up
before
he
could
carry
out
his
purpose
he
was
joined
by
harry
kent
finley
had
to
go
out
the
latter
explained
i
told
him
i
would
go
up
to
rochester
apartment
with
ferguson
thoughtfully
caressed
his
jaw
for
a
second
then
came
to
a
rapid
decision
lead
the
way
sir
he
said
i
kent
found
him
a
silent
companion
while
in
the
elevator
and
when
walking
down
the
corridor
to
rochester
apartment
but
once
inside
the
living
room
with
the
outer
door
tightly
closed
ferguson
tossed
down
his
hat
and
his
whole
demeanor
changed
sit
down
he
selected
a
chair
near
rochester
desk
for
himself
as
kent
found
another
let
thrash
this
thing
out
are
you
working
with
me
or
against
me
why
do
you
ask
kent
surprise
at
the
question
was
evident
because
every
time
i
arrange
to
examine
this
apartment
or
inquire
into
rochester
whereabouts
you
show
ferguson
small
eyes
were
trying
to
kent
but
the
latter
clear
gaze
did
not
drop
before
his
are
you
aiding
philip
rochester
in
his
efforts
to
elude
arrest
i
am
not
declared
kent
emphatically
what
prompts
the
question
the
fact
that
you
are
rochester
partner
ferguson
pointed
out
his
manner
was
still
stiff
it
would
be
only
natural
for
you
to
help
him
disappear
out
of
friendship
or
with
a
sidelong
glance
from
a
desire
to
hush
up
a
on
the
contrary
i
want
rochester
found
and
every
bit
of
evidence
against
him
sifted
out
and
aired
retorted
kent
two
heads
are
better
than
one
ferguson
let
us
work
together
rochester
must
be
located
within
the
next
ferguson
debated
a
moment
but
kent
speech
as
well
as
his
manner
indicated
his
sincerity
and
the
detective
shook
off
his
suspicions
have
you
had
any
further
news
of
your
partner
he
asked
no
that
is
recalling
the
scene
in
the
bank
early
that
afternoon
nothing
that
relates
to
rochester
present
whereabouts
now
ferguson
to
put
your
charges
against
rochester
in
concrete
form
you
believe
that
he
was
insanely
jealous
of
jimmie
turnbull
that
he
recognized
him
in
the
police
court
in
his
burglar
disguise
slipped
a
dose
of
aconitine
in
a
glass
of
water
which
turnbull
drank
and
after
declaring
that
his
friend
had
died
from
angina
pectoris
disappeared
is
that
all
the
case
you
have
against
him
at
present
yes
admitted
the
detective
cautiously
all
circumstantial
evidence
but
it
will
hold
in
court
ah
will
it
questioned
kent
there
one
big
flaw
in
your
case
ferguson
the
poison
used
to
kill
aconitine
exactly
your
theory
is
that
rochester
slipped
the
poison
in
the
glass
of
water
on
recognizing
turnbull
in
the
police
court
now
it
is
stretching
probability
to
suppose
that
rochester
a
strong
healthy
man
was
carrying
that
drug
around
in
his
vest
ferguson
sat
forward
in
his
chair
his
eyes
glittering
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
think
the
murder
of
turnbull
was
premeditated
and
not
committed
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
he
asked
the
fact
that
aconitine
was
used
convinces
me
of
that
answered
kent
ferguson
thought
a
moment
if
that
is
the
case
he
said
grudgingly
it
sort
of
squashes
the
charge
against
philip
it
would
seem
to
agreed
kent
but
every
shred
of
evidence
i
find
points
to
rochester
as
the
guilty
ferguson
edged
his
chair
forward
what
have
you
discovered
he
demanded
eagerly
this
kent
spoke
with
increased
earnestness
that
philip
rochester
is
apparently
a
bankrupt
that
he
has
his
private
account
at
the
metropolis
trust
company
and
withdrawn
our
partnership
funds
from
the
same
your
partnership
funds
echoed
the
detective
eyeing
kent
sharply
how
did
you
come
to
let
him
do
that
i
was
not
aware
that
he
had
done
so
until
clymer
told
me
of
the
transaction
this
afternoon
answered
kent
you
did
not
know
ferguson
looked
at
him
in
dawning
comprehension
you
mean
rochester
absconded
with
the
funds
some
one
forged
my
name
to
checks
drawn
on
the
firm
account
kent
continued
i
understood
they
were
made
payable
to
cash
and
presented
by
rochester
on
the
day
of
turnbull
ferguson
whistled
as
a
slight
vent
to
his
feelings
so
you
suspect
rochester
of
being
a
forger
kent
made
no
reply
and
he
added
after
a
moment
deliberation
what
bearing
has
this
discovery
on
turnbull
death
aside
from
rochester
need
of
funds
to
make
a
clean
disappearance
if
it
is
true
that
rochester
was
financially
embarrassed
and
forged
checks
on
the
metropolis
trust
company
it
establishes
another
motive
for
the
killing
of
turnbull
argued
kent
turnbull
was
cashier
of
that
i
see
he
may
have
discovered
the
forgeries
but
hold
ferguson
checked
his
rapid
speech
when
were
these
forged
checks
presented
at
the
bank
tuesday
ferguson
face
fell
pshaw
man
that
was
after
turnbull
death
how
could
he
detect
the
forgeries
kent
did
not
reply
at
once
instead
he
glanced
keenly
about
the
living
room
the
detective
had
only
switched
on
one
of
the
reading
lamps
and
the
greater
part
was
in
shadow
it
was
a
pleasant
and
room
and
kent
was
conscious
of
a
keener
pang
for
the
loss
of
jimmie
turnbull
and
the
disappearance
of
philip
rochester
as
he
gazed
around
the
lawyer
and
the
bank
cashier
had
been
until
that
winter
congenial
comrades
sharing
their
business
success
and
their
apartment
in
complete
accord
and
now
a
shadow
as
black
as
that
enveloping
the
unlighted
apartment
hung
over
their
good
names
threatening
one
or
the
other
with
the
charge
of
forgery
and
of
murder
kent
sighed
and
turned
back
to
the
silent
detective
i
can
best
answer
your
question
by
telling
you
that
the
day
after
jimmie
turnbull
died
clymer
sent
for
me
he
began
i
found
colonel
mcintyre
with
him
and
was
told
that
the
colonel
had
lost
valuable
securities
left
at
the
bank
these
securities
had
been
given
by
the
treasurer
of
the
bank
to
jimmie
turnbull
when
he
presented
a
letter
from
colonel
mcintyre
instructing
the
bank
to
surrender
the
securities
to
well
questioned
ferguson
go
on
that
letter
was
a
kent
sat
back
and
watched
the
rapidly
changing
expression
and
no
trace
has
been
found
of
the
colonel
securities
last
known
to
be
in
the
possession
of
great
heavens
ejaculated
ferguson
which
was
the
forger
turnbull
or
rochester
kent
shook
a
puzzled
head
that
is
for
us
to
discover
he
said
soberly
colonel
mcintyre
contends
that
turnbull
forged
the
letter
and
stole
the
securities
then
fearing
his
guilt
would
become
known
committed
still
another
crime
that
of
suicide
he
could
have
swallowed
a
dose
of
aconitine
while
at
the
police
well
i
be
blessed
ejaculated
ferguson
but
if
he
was
the
forger
how
does
that
square
with
rochester
peculiar
behavior
the
checks
bearing
your
forged
signatures
were
presented
mind
you
by
rochester
after
turnbull
death
it
does
square
acknowledged
kent
frankly
there
is
this
to
be
said
for
turnbull
he
was
the
soul
of
honor
his
affairs
were
found
to
be
in
excellent
condition
he
was
drawing
a
good
salary
his
investments
paying
well
he
did
not
need
to
acquire
securities
or
money
by
resorting
to
whereas
philip
rochester
was
on
the
point
of
bankruptcy
remarked
ferguson
do
you
suppose
he
forged
colonel
mcintyre
letter
and
gave
it
to
turnbull
and
the
latter
got
the
securities
from
the
bank
treasurer
and
handed
them
over
to
rochester
in
good
faith
supposing
his
would
give
the
papers
to
colonel
mcintyre
kent
nodded
in
agreement
it
looks
that
way
to
me
he
said
gloomily
philip
rochester
stood
well
in
the
community
his
law
practice
is
large
and
lucrative
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
his
periods
of
idleness
and
and
hesitating
passion
for
good
living
he
would
never
have
run
into
but
he
got
ferguson
laugh
was
contemptuous
a
desperate
man
will
do
anything
i
know
kent
looked
dubious
i
would
believe
him
guilty
if
it
were
not
for
the
use
of
aconitine
that
shows
premeditation
on
the
part
of
the
and
why
should
rochester
plan
turnbull
murder
ahead
of
the
scene
in
the
police
court
argued
ferguson
was
he
living
in
deadly
fear
of
exposure
if
he
did
not
commit
the
murder
why
did
he
run
away
and
if
he
is
innocent
why
does
he
come
forward
and
prove
it
he
may
not
know
that
he
is
suspected
of
the
crime
retorted
kent
rising
it
is
for
us
to
find
rochester
and
i
suggest
that
we
search
this
apartment
i
have
already
done
so
objected
ferguson
and
there
was
the
faintest
clew
to
his
hiding
for
all
that
i
am
not
kent
walked
over
and
switched
on
another
light
when
i
came
here
on
wednesday
night
i
had
a
tussle
with
some
man
but
he
escaped
in
the
dark
without
my
seeing
him
i
believe
he
was
you
are
probably
ferguson
crossed
the
room
and
if
he
came
back
once
he
may
return
again
come
ahead
and
he
plunged
into
the
first
bedroom
the
two
men
subjected
each
room
to
an
exhaustive
search
but
their
labors
were
their
only
reward
except
for
an
accumulation
of
dust
the
apartment
was
undisturbed
they
had
reached
the
when
the
gong
over
their
heads
sounded
loudly
and
kent
with
a
muttered
exclamation
hastened
toward
the
front
door
of
the
apartment
ferguson
intent
on
studying
the
l
of
the
building
as
seen
from
the
window
was
hardly
conscious
of
his
departure
and
some
seconds
elapsed
before
he
turned
toward
the
door
as
he
gained
it
he
saw
a
dark
shape
dart
down
the
hall
with
a
bound
ferguson
started
in
pursuit
and
the
next
second
grappled
with
the
flying
man
just
as
the
electric
lights
went
out
and
they
were
plunged
in
darkness
suddenly
kent
voice
echoed
down
the
hall
come
here
quick
ferguson
there
was
a
note
of
urgency
about
his
appeal
and
ferguson
straining
his
muscles
until
the
blood
pounded
in
his
temples
threw
the
struggling
man
into
a
tufted
which
stood
by
the
entrance
to
the
small
dining
room
and
drawing
out
his
handcuffs
slipped
them
on
securely
stay
there
ferguson
admonished
his
prisoner
or
there
will
be
worse
coming
to
you
and
he
thrust
the
muzzle
of
his
revolver
against
the
heaving
chest
to
illustrate
his
meaning
then
as
kent
called
again
he
sped
down
the
hall
and
brought
up
breathless
at
the
front
door
the
light
was
still
burning
in
the
corridor
though
not
very
brightly
and
he
saw
kent
hand
the
grinning
messenger
boy
a
shiny
quarter
touching
his
battered
cap
the
boy
went
whistling
away
tell
the
elevator
boy
to
report
that
a
fuse
has
burned
out
in
rochester
apartment
ferguson
called
after
him
and
the
lad
waved
his
hand
as
he
dashed
into
the
elevator
paying
no
attention
to
the
detective
call
kent
showed
him
a
white
envelope
which
bore
the
simple
address
philip
rochester
esq
the
saratoga
it
the
identical
envelope
i
found
in
your
safe
declared
ferguson
and
which
disappeared
last
night
at
the
club
de
kent
turned
over
the
envelope
see
the
red
for
a
minute
the
men
contemplated
the
seal
with
the
large
distinctive
letter
b
in
the
center
open
the
letter
sir
ferguson
urged
and
kent
his
fingers
fairly
trembling
jerked
and
tore
at
the
linen
incased
envelope
the
flap
ripped
away
and
he
opened
the
envelope
it
was
empty
instinctively
the
two
men
glanced
down
at
the
parquetry
flooring
nothing
but
a
thin
coating
of
dust
lay
there
and
kent
looked
up
and
down
the
corridor
it
was
deserted
do
you
recognize
the
handwriting
asked
ferguson
kent
regarded
the
envelope
in
bewilderment
what
shall
we
do
do
call
up
the
dime
messenger
service
and
see
where
the
envelope
came
from
but
first
come
and
see
my
prisoner
your
prisoner
in
profound
astonishment
yes
i
caught
him
chasing
up
the
hall
after
you
explained
ferguson
as
they
hurriedly
retraced
their
steps
i
put
handcuffs
on
him
and
then
went
to
you
ah
here
the
light
the
light
yes
but
where
your
prisoner
and
kent
who
was
a
trifle
in
advance
of
his
companion
in
reaching
the
dining
room
stood
aside
to
let
ferguson
pass
him
the
detective
halted
abruptly
the
chair
into
which
he
had
thrust
his
prisoner
was
vacant
the
man
had
disappeared
with
one
accord
ferguson
and
kent
advanced
close
to
the
chair
and
an
oath
broke
from
the
detective
on
the
cushion
of
the
chair
still
bearing
the
impress
of
a
human
body
lay
a
pair
of
shining
new
handcuffs
dazedly
ferguson
stooped
over
and
examined
them
they
were
still
securely
locked
wheeling
around
kent
dashed
through
the
door
to
his
right
and
ferguson
collecting
his
wits
searched
the
rest
of
the
apartment
with
minute
care
five
minutes
later
he
came
face
to
face
with
kent
in
the
living
room
not
a
trace
of
any
kind
declared
kent
it
the
same
as
the
other
night
the
man
gone
it
it
positively
ferguson
face
was
red
from
mortification
and
his
exertions
combined
the
fellow
must
have
slipped
from
the
room
by
that
other
door
and
out
through
the
living
room
as
we
came
down
the
hail
he
said
did
you
shut
the
door
of
the
apartment
kent
before
coming
down
here
to
look
at
the
prisoner
kent
led
the
way
back
to
the
dining
room
did
you
recognize
the
man
ferguson
the
detective
swore
softly
as
he
stared
about
the
room
the
lights
went
out
just
as
i
tackled
it
was
beastly
luck
that
the
fuse
burned
out
at
that
second
groaned
kent
fortune
was
with
him
in
that
but
how
did
the
man
get
free
of
the
handcuffs
pointing
to
them
still
lying
in
the
chair
we
attribute
that
to
luck
unless
staring
keenly
at
ferguson
unless
you
did
not
snap
them
on
the
man
wrists
after
i
did
i
swear
it
declared
ferguson
i
no
novice
at
that
business
here
do
touch
them
kent
as
his
companion
bent
toward
the
chair
there
may
be
finger
marks
on
the
steel
if
so
he
drew
out
his
handkerchief
and
taking
care
not
to
handle
the
burnished
metal
he
folded
the
handcuffs
carefully
in
it
and
put
them
in
his
coat
pocket
there
no
use
lingering
here
kent
this
apartment
is
vacant
now
except
for
us
i
must
get
to
had
you
better
telephone
for
an
operative
and
station
him
here
suggested
kent
i
did
so
while
you
were
searching
the
back
rooms
replied
ferguson
there
as
the
gong
sounded
that
nelson
but
the
person
who
stood
in
the
outer
corridor
when
they
opened
the
front
door
was
not
nelson
the
operative
but
stone
can
i
see
rochester
he
asked
then
catching
sight
of
kent
standing
just
back
of
the
detective
he
added
hello
kent
i
thought
i
heard
some
one
walking
about
in
here
from
my
apartment
next
door
and
concluded
rochester
had
returned
can
i
see
him
kent
spoke
slowly
with
a
at
the
silent
detective
rochester
has
been
here
and
chapter
xvi
the
crimson
outline
barbara
mcintyre
made
the
round
of
the
library
for
the
fifth
time
testing
each
of
the
seven
doors
opening
into
it
to
see
that
they
were
closed
behind
their
portieres
then
she
turned
back
to
her
sister
who
sat
before
a
small
safe
any
luck
she
asked
instead
of
replying
helen
removed
the
key
from
the
lock
of
the
steel
door
and
regarded
it
attentively
the
safe
was
of
an
obsolete
pattern
and
in
place
of
the
customary
combination
lock
was
opened
by
means
of
a
key
unique
in
appearance
it
is
certainly
the
key
which
father
mislaid
six
months
ago
she
declared
grimes
found
it
just
after
father
had
a
new
key
made
and
gave
it
to
me
and
yet
i
ca
get
the
door
let
me
barbara
crouched
down
by
her
sister
and
inserted
the
key
again
in
the
lock
but
her
efforts
met
with
no
results
and
after
five
minutes
steady
manipulation
she
gave
up
the
attempt
i
am
afraid
it
is
impossible
she
admitted
seems
to
me
i
have
heard
that
the
lost
key
will
not
open
a
safe
after
a
new
key
has
been
helen
rose
slowly
to
her
feet
stretching
her
cramped
limbs
carefully
as
she
did
so
and
sank
down
in
the
nearest
chair
her
attitude
indicated
dejection
then
we
ca
find
the
envelope
she
muttered
hurry
babs
and
close
the
outer
door
father
may
return
at
any
barbara
obeyed
the
injunction
with
such
alacrity
that
the
door
concealing
the
space
in
the
wall
where
stood
the
safe
flew
to
with
a
bang
and
the
twins
jumped
nervously
take
care
exclaimed
helen
sharply
do
you
wish
to
arouse
the
household
no
danger
of
but
barbara
glanced
apprehensively
about
the
library
in
spite
of
her
reassuring
statement
the
servants
are
either
out
or
upstairs
and
margaret
brewster
is
writing
letters
in
our
sitting
had
you
better
go
upstairs
and
join
her
helen
suggested
do
babs
as
her
sister
hesitated
i
can
not
feel
sure
that
she
will
not
interrupt
but
my
joining
her
wo
keep
margaret
upstairs
objected
barbara
no
but
you
can
call
and
warn
me
if
she
is
on
her
way
down
and
that
will
give
me
time
to
to
straighten
father
papers
going
over
to
a
large
carved
table
littered
with
magazines
letters
and
silver
ornaments
her
sister
did
not
move
and
she
glanced
at
her
with
an
irritated
air
very
foreign
to
her
customary
manner
go
the
curt
command
brought
a
stare
from
barbara
but
it
did
not
accelerate
her
halting
footsteps
instead
she
moved
with
even
greater
slowness
toward
the
hall
door
her
active
brain
tormented
with
an
unspoken
and
unanswered
question
why
was
helen
so
anxious
for
her
departure
she
had
accepted
her
offer
of
assistance
in
her
search
of
the
library
with
such
marked
reluctance
that
barbara
had
marveled
at
the
time
and
now
are
you
quite
sure
helen
that
father
had
the
envelope
in
his
pocket
this
morning
she
asked
for
the
third
time
since
the
search
began
he
had
an
envelope
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
red
seal
answered
helen
then
just
before
dinner
he
was
putting
some
papers
in
the
safe
oh
if
grimes
had
only
come
in
a
moment
sooner
to
announce
dinner
i
might
have
had
a
chance
to
look
in
the
safe
before
father
closed
the
whatever
reply
barbara
intended
making
was
checked
by
the
rattling
of
the
knob
of
the
hall
door
it
turned
slowly
the
door
opened
and
pushing
aside
the
portieres
drawn
across
the
entrance
margaret
brewster
glided
in
so
glad
to
find
you
she
cooed
but
why
have
you
closed
up
the
room
and
turned
on
all
the
lights
to
see
better
retorted
barbara
promptly
as
the
widow
eyes
roved
around
the
large
room
taking
silent
note
of
the
drawn
curtains
and
portieres
and
the
somewhat
disarranged
furniture
come
inside
margaret
and
help
us
in
our
for
what
the
widow
tried
to
keep
her
tone
natural
but
a
certain
shrill
alertness
crept
into
it
and
barbara
who
was
watching
her
closely
was
quick
to
detect
the
change
helen
color
altered
at
the
question
and
she
observed
the
widow
entrance
with
veiled
hostility
for
my
seal
barbara
answered
the
one
with
the
big
letter
have
you
seen
it
i
the
widow
took
a
chair
uninvited
near
helen
you
look
tired
helen
dear
why
do
you
go
to
bed
i
could
not
sleep
if
i
helen
passed
a
nervous
finger
across
her
eyes
but
do
let
me
keep
you
and
babs
up
it
wo
take
me
long
to
arrange
market
order
for
under
pretense
of
searching
for
pencil
and
paper
helen
contrived
to
see
the
address
of
every
letter
lying
on
the
table
but
the
envelope
she
sought
with
its
red
seal
was
not
among
them
when
she
looked
up
again
pencil
and
paper
in
hand
she
found
brewster
leaning
lazily
back
and
regarding
her
from
under
lids
you
are
very
like
your
father
helen
she
commented
softly
the
girl
stiffened
am
i
babs
and
i
are
generally
thought
to
resemble
our
in
appearance
yes
but
i
mean
mannerisms
for
instance
the
way
of
holding
your
pencil
your
handwriting
even
closely
resembles
your
brewster
pointed
to
the
notes
helen
was
scribbling
on
the
paper
and
to
an
open
letter
bearing
colonel
mcintyre
signature
at
the
bottom
of
the
sheet
lying
beside
the
pad
to
illustrate
her
meaning
these
are
almost
you
are
a
close
helen
completed
her
memorandum
and
laid
it
aside
what
became
of
father
he
went
to
a
stag
supper
at
the
willard
chimed
in
barbara
stopping
her
aimless
walk
about
the
library
he
said
we
were
not
to
wait
up
for
helen
pushed
back
her
chair
and
rose
with
some
abruptness
i
am
more
tired
than
i
realized
she
remarked
and
involuntarily
stretched
her
weary
muscles
come
margaret
laying
a
persuasive
hand
on
the
widow
shoulder
be
a
trump
and
rub
my
forehead
with
cologne
as
you
used
to
do
abroad
when
i
had
a
headache
it
always
put
me
to
sleep
then
and
oh
how
i
long
for
sleep
now
there
was
infinite
pathos
in
her
voice
and
brewster
sprang
up
and
threw
her
arm
about
her
in
ready
sympathy
you
poor
darling
she
exclaimed
let
me
put
you
to
bed
mammy
taught
me
the
art
of
soothing
frayed
nerves
come
with
us
babs
holding
out
her
left
hand
to
barbara
but
the
latter
with
a
dexterous
twist
slipped
away
from
her
touch
i
must
stay
and
straighten
the
library
she
announced
brewster
delicate
color
had
deepened
it
would
be
as
well
to
open
some
of
the
doors
she
agreed
coldly
the
library
looks
odd
not
to
say
funereal
she
glanced
down
the
spacious
room
and
shivered
ever
so
slightly
do
babs
put
out
some
of
the
lights
they
are
oh
i
turn
them
all
out
barbara
sought
the
electric
switch
but
your
father
no
need
to
worry
about
father
he
can
find
his
way
about
in
the
dark
like
a
cat
responded
barbara
with
unabated
cheerfulness
seems
to
me
margaret
you
and
father
are
getting
mighty
chummy
these
the
sudden
darkness
into
which
barbara
impatient
fingers
pressing
against
the
electric
light
buttons
plunged
the
library
and
its
occupants
prevented
her
seeing
the
curious
glance
which
brewster
shot
at
her
helen
who
had
listened
to
their
chatter
with
growing
impatience
looked
back
over
her
shoulder
hurry
barbara
and
come
upstairs
now
margaret
and
she
piloted
the
widow
along
the
hall
toward
the
staircase
without
giving
her
an
opportunity
to
answer
barbara
last
remark
barbara
pausing
only
long
enough
to
pull
back
the
portieres
of
the
hall
door
and
arrange
them
as
they
hung
customarily
turned
to
go
upstairs
just
as
grimes
came
down
the
hall
from
the
dining
room
carrying
a
large
tray
with
pitchers
of
ice
water
and
glasses
i
thought
you
had
gone
to
your
room
grimes
she
remarked
as
the
butler
waited
respectfully
for
her
to
pass
him
i
just
come
in
miss
and
found
murray
had
left
the
tray
in
the
dining
room
explained
grimes
hurriedly
i
hope
miss
i
not
disturb
the
ladies
by
knocking
at
their
doors
now
with
this
ice
oh
no
brewster
and
miss
helen
have
only
just
gone
barbara
paused
in
front
of
the
butler
and
poured
out
a
glass
of
water
i
ca
wait
grimes
i
am
too
certainly
miss
that
all
grimes
craned
his
head
around
and
looked
up
and
down
the
hail
then
leaning
over
he
placed
the
tray
on
a
convenient
table
and
stepped
close
to
barbara
i
been
reading
the
newspapers
very
carefully
miss
he
began
taking
care
to
keep
his
voice
lowered
especially
that
part
of
turnbull
inquest
which
tells
about
the
well
what
then
asked
barbara
quickly
as
the
butler
paused
and
again
glanced
up
and
down
the
hall
just
this
miss
he
spoke
almost
in
a
whisper
the
doctors
do
say
poor
turnbull
was
poisoned
by
acca
aconitine
stumbling
over
the
word
it
a
curious
thing
miss
that
i
brought
some
of
that
very
drug
into
this
house
last
you
did
barbara
fresh
young
voice
rose
in
astonishment
hush
miss
the
butler
raised
both
hands
hush
he
glanced
cautiously
around
then
continued
colonel
mcintyre
sent
me
to
the
druggist
with
a
prescription
from
stone
for
brewster
when
she
had
romantic
had
what
barbara
looked
puzzled
then
giggled
but
her
mirth
quickly
altered
to
seriousness
at
sight
of
the
butler
expression
mrs
brewster
had
a
touch
of
rheumatic
neuralgia
the
first
of
the
month
do
you
refer
to
that
yes
grimes
spoke
more
rapidly
but
kept
his
voice
lowered
the
druggist
told
me
what
the
pills
were
when
i
exclaimed
at
their
size
regular
little
pellets
no
bigger
than
that
he
demonstrated
the
size
with
the
tip
of
his
little
finger
and
would
have
added
more
but
the
gong
over
the
front
door
rang
out
with
such
suddenness
that
both
he
and
barbara
started
violently
just
a
moment
miss
and
he
hurried
to
the
front
bell
to
return
after
a
brief
colloquy
with
a
messenger
boy
bearing
a
letter
it
for
brewster
miss
he
explained
as
barbara
held
out
her
hand
i
give
it
to
her
and
this
also
barbara
took
the
envelope
and
a
small
ice
pitcher
and
glass
good
night
grimes
oh
she
stopped
midway
up
the
staircase
and
waited
for
the
butler
to
overtake
her
grimes
to
whom
did
you
give
the
aconitine
on
sunday
i
did
give
it
to
nobody
the
butler
was
a
trifle
short
of
breath
his
years
did
not
permit
him
to
keep
pace
with
the
twins
i
was
in
a
great
hurry
as
the
druggist
kept
me
waiting
and
i
had
to
serve
tea
at
but
what
did
you
do
with
the
aconitine
pills
demanded
barbara
i
left
the
box
on
the
hail
table
miss
great
heavens
barbara
stared
at
the
butler
then
without
a
word
she
raced
up
the
staircase
and
disappeared
through
the
open
door
of
brewster
bedroom
the
light
from
the
hall
shone
through
the
transom
and
doorway
in
sufficient
volume
to
clearly
indicate
the
different
pieces
of
furniture
and
barbara
put
the
pitcher
and
glass
on
the
bed
stand
and
laid
the
letter
which
grimes
had
given
her
on
the
dressing
table
then
went
slowly
into
her
own
bedroom
she
could
hear
voices
which
she
recognized
as
those
of
her
sister
and
brewster
coming
from
helen
bedroom
but
absorbed
in
her
own
thoughts
she
undressed
in
the
dark
and
crept
into
bed
just
as
brewster
passed
down
the
hallway
and
entered
her
own
room
the
widow
had
taken
off
her
evening
gown
and
slippers
and
donned
a
becoming
wrapper
before
she
discovered
the
letter
lying
on
the
dresser
drawing
up
a
chair
she
dropped
into
it
let
down
her
long
dark
hair
and
settled
back
in
luxuriant
comfort
against
the
tufted
upholstery
before
she
ran
her
finger
under
the
flap
of
the
envelope
a
slip
of
paper
fell
into
her
lap
as
she
took
out
the
contents
of
the
envelope
and
she
let
it
rest
there
while
scanning
the
closely
typewritten
lines
on
the
metropolis
trust
company
stationery
dear
brewster
she
read
our
bank
teller
mcdonald
has
questioned
the
genuineness
of
the
signature
on
the
inclosed
check
an
important
business
engagement
prevents
my
calling
but
please
stop
at
the
bank
early
morning
i
feel
that
you
would
prefer
to
have
a
personal
investigation
made
rather
than
have
us
place
the
matter
in
the
hands
of
the
police
yours
faithfully
benjamin
clymer
the
widow
read
the
note
a
number
of
times
then
bethinking
herself
she
picked
up
the
canceled
check
still
lying
in
her
lap
and
turned
it
over
long
and
intently
she
studied
the
signature
the
peculiarly
characteristic
formation
of
the
letter
b
caught
and
held
her
attention
as
the
seconds
ticked
themselves
into
minutes
she
sat
immovable
her
face
as
white
as
the
hand
on
which
she
had
bowed
her
head
across
the
hall
helen
mcintyre
tossed
from
one
side
to
the
other
in
her
soft
bed
her
restless
longing
to
get
up
was
growing
stronger
and
stronger
while
brewster
deft
fingers
and
the
cooling
cologne
had
stopped
the
throbbing
in
her
temples
they
had
brought
only
temporary
relief
in
their
train
and
not
the
sleep
which
helen
craved
she
strained
her
ears
to
discover
the
time
by
the
ticking
of
her
clock
but
either
it
was
between
the
half
or
quarters
of
an
hour
or
it
had
stopped
for
no
chimes
sounded
with
a
gasp
of
exasperation
helen
flung
back
the
bed
clothes
and
sat
up
switching
on
the
light
by
the
side
of
her
bed
she
hunted
for
a
book
but
not
finding
any
she
contemplated
for
a
short
space
of
time
a
pair
of
shoes
just
showing
themselves
under
the
edge
of
a
chair
with
sudden
decision
she
left
the
bed
and
dressed
rapidly
it
was
not
until
she
had
put
on
her
shoes
that
she
paused
her
hesitation
however
was
but
brief
stepping
to
the
bureau
she
pulled
out
a
lower
drawer
and
running
her
hand
inside
touched
a
concealed
spring
from
the
cavity
thus
exposed
she
took
a
small
automatic
pistol
and
with
a
stealthy
glance
about
her
crept
from
the
room
the
library
had
been
vacant
fully
an
hour
when
a
mouse
intent
on
making
a
raid
on
the
candy
which
barbara
had
carelessly
left
lying
loose
on
one
of
the
tables
paused
as
a
faint
creaking
sound
broke
the
stillness
then
as
the
noise
increased
the
mouse
scurried
back
to
its
hole
the
noise
resembled
the
turning
of
rusty
hinges
and
the
soft
thud
of
one
piece
of
wood
striking
another
there
was
a
strained
silence
then
from
out
of
the
darkness
appeared
a
tiny
stream
of
light
directed
full
on
a
white
envelope
bearing
a
large
red
seal
the
next
instant
the
envelope
was
plucked
from
the
hand
holding
it
and
a
figure
lay
crumpled
on
the
floor
from
the
blow
of
a
descending
weapon
it
was
closely
approaching
one
in
the
morning
before
brewster
stirred
from
her
comfortable
bedroom
chair
taking
up
her
electric
torch
which
she
kept
always
by
the
side
of
her
bed
she
walked
quickly
down
the
staircase
and
into
the
pitch
dark
library
directing
her
so
that
she
steered
a
safe
course
among
the
chairs
and
tables
she
approached
one
of
the
pieces
of
carved
venetian
furniture
and
reached
out
her
hand
to
touch
a
as
she
looked
for
the
spring
she
was
horrified
to
see
a
thin
stream
of
blood
oozing
through
the
carving
until
reaching
the
letter
b
it
outlined
that
initial
in
sinister
red
scream
after
scream
broke
from
brewster
she
was
swaying
upon
her
feet
by
the
time
colonel
mcintyre
and
his
daughter
helen
reached
the
library
margaret
what
is
it
mcintyre
demanded
calm
yourself
my
the
frenzied
woman
shook
off
his
soothing
hand
see
see
she
cried
and
pointed
with
her
torch
she
means
the
venetian
casket
explained
helen
who
had
paused
before
joining
them
to
switch
on
the
light
colonel
mcintyre
gazed
in
amazement
at
the
piece
of
furniture
then
catching
sight
of
the
he
raised
the
small
or
peep
hole
in
the
top
of
the
oblong
box
which
stood
breast
high
supported
on
a
beautifully
carved
base
there
was
a
breathless
pause
then
mcintyre
unceremoniously
jerked
the
electric
torch
from
brewster
nervous
fingers
and
turned
its
rays
of
the
interior
of
the
casket
stretched
at
full
length
lay
the
figure
of
a
man
and
from
a
wound
in
his
temple
flowed
a
steady
stream
of
blood
good
god
mcintyre
staggered
back
against
helen
grimes
chapter
xvii
a
question
of
the
genial
president
of
the
metropolis
trust
company
was
late
brewster
waiting
in
his
office
restrained
her
only
by
an
exertion
of
she
detested
being
kept
waiting
and
that
morning
she
had
many
errands
to
attend
to
before
the
luncheon
hour
may
i
use
your
telephone
she
asked
clymer
secretary
and
the
young
man
rose
with
alacrity
from
his
desk
brewster
never
knew
what
it
was
to
lack
attention
even
her
own
sex
were
known
on
occasions
to
give
her
gowns
and
what
captious
critics
termed
her
frivolous
conduct
undivided
attention
can
i
look
up
the
number
for
you
the
secretary
asked
as
brewster
took
up
the
telephone
book
and
fumbled
for
the
gold
chain
of
her
lorgnette
oh
thank
you
her
smile
showed
each
pretty
dimple
i
wish
to
speak
to
kent
of
the
firm
of
rochester
and
harry
kent
the
young
secretary
dropped
the
book
without
looking
at
it
and
gave
a
number
to
the
operator
and
then
handed
the
instrument
to
brewster
mr
kent
not
in
did
you
say
asked
the
widow
who
is
speaking
ah
sylvester
has
rochester
returned
partners
away
she
paused
i
call
later
brewster
good
brewster
hung
up
the
receiver
and
turned
to
the
secretary
i
do
believe
i
can
wait
any
longer
she
began
and
paused
as
benjamin
clymer
appeared
in
the
doorway
so
sorry
to
be
late
he
exclaimed
shaking
her
hand
warmly
and
i
am
sorry
also
to
have
called
you
here
on
such
an
brewster
waited
until
the
young
secretary
had
withdrawn
out
of
earshot
before
replying
then
taking
the
chair
clymer
placed
for
her
near
his
own
she
opened
her
gold
mesh
bag
and
took
out
a
canceled
check
and
laid
it
on
the
desk
in
front
of
the
bank
president
your
bank
honored
this
check
she
asked
who
presented
it
clymer
pressed
the
buzzer
and
his
secretary
came
at
once
ask
mcdonald
to
step
here
and
as
the
man
vanished
on
his
errand
he
addressed
brewster
how
is
colonel
mcintyre
this
morning
brewster
eyes
opened
at
the
question
quite
well
she
replied
and
prompted
by
her
curiosity
added
what
made
you
think
him
ill
i
stopped
at
stone
office
on
the
way
down
town
and
his
boy
told
me
the
doctor
had
been
sent
for
by
colonel
mcintyre
clymer
explained
i
hope
neither
of
the
twins
is
no
colonel
mcintyre
sent
for
stone
to
attend
grimes
the
butler
too
bad
he
is
ill
grimes
is
an
institution
in
the
mcintyre
clymer
spoke
with
sincere
regret
and
brewster
eyed
him
approvingly
she
liked
men
of
his
stamp
come
in
mcdonald
as
the
bank
teller
appeared
you
know
brewster
mr
mcdonald
was
one
of
my
first
acquaintances
in
washington
and
brewster
smiled
as
she
held
out
her
hand
about
this
check
mcdonald
clymer
handed
it
to
the
teller
as
he
spoke
who
presented
it
miss
which
miss
mcintyre
brewster
put
the
question
with
swift
intentness
i
ca
tell
one
twin
from
the
other
confessed
mcdonald
but
as
you
see
the
check
is
made
payable
to
barbara
the
inference
being
that
barbara
mcintyre
presented
the
check
for
payment
commented
clymer
and
mcdonald
bowed
it
would
seem
therefore
that
barbara
wrote
your
signature
on
the
check
the
widow
had
whitened
under
her
rouge
but
her
eyes
did
not
falter
in
their
direct
gaze
the
signature
is
genuine
i
drew
the
the
two
men
exchanged
glances
the
bank
president
was
the
first
to
break
the
short
silence
in
that
case
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
he
remarked
and
picking
up
the
check
handed
it
to
brewster
without
a
glance
at
it
she
folded
the
paper
and
placed
it
inside
her
gold
mesh
bag
i
must
not
take
up
any
more
of
your
time
she
said
i
thank
you
mrs
clymer
spoke
impulsively
i
like
to
shake
hands
with
coloring
warmly
the
widow
slipped
her
small
hand
inside
his
and
with
a
friendly
bow
to
mcdonald
she
walked
through
the
bank
keeping
up
with
clymer
long
strides
as
best
she
could
as
they
crossed
the
sidewalk
to
the
waiting
limousine
they
ran
almost
into
the
arms
of
harry
kent
whose
rapid
gait
did
not
suit
the
congested
condition
of
the
wall
street
of
washington
i
tried
to
reach
you
on
the
telephone
this
morning
exclaimed
brewster
after
greeting
him
so
my
clerk
informed
me
when
i
saw
him
a
few
minutes
kent
helped
her
inside
the
limousine
wo
you
come
to
my
office
now
but
that
will
be
taking
you
from
clymer
remonstrated
brewster
were
you
on
the
way
to
the
bank
i
was
admitted
kent
but
i
can
see
clymer
later
in
the
and
i
be
less
occupied
then
added
clymer
go
with
brewster
kent
good
morning
madam
and
with
a
courtly
bow
clymer
withdrew
kent
office
was
only
around
the
corner
and
as
brewster
kept
up
a
running
fire
of
impersonal
gossip
kent
had
no
opportunity
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
regarding
her
reasons
for
wanting
to
interview
him
as
the
limousine
drew
up
at
the
curb
in
front
of
his
office
a
man
darting
down
the
steps
of
the
building
caught
sight
of
kent
and
hurried
to
the
car
window
i
was
just
trying
to
catch
you
at
the
bank
kent
he
explained
and
looking
around
kent
recognized
sylvester
there
been
three
telephone
calls
for
you
in
succession
from
colonel
mcintyre
to
hurry
to
his
thanks
kent
turned
to
brewster
would
you
mind
driving
me
to
the
mcintyre
we
can
talk
on
the
way
brewster
picked
up
the
speaking
tube
home
harris
she
directed
as
the
chauffeur
listened
for
the
order
neither
spoke
as
the
big
car
started
up
the
street
but
as
they
swung
past
old
john
church
brewster
broke
her
silence
mr
kent
she
drew
further
back
in
her
corner
i
claim
a
privilege
to
change
my
mind
forget
that
i
ever
expressed
a
wish
to
consult
you
professionally
and
remember
i
am
always
glad
to
meet
you
as
a
certainly
brewster
as
you
kent
tone
expressing
polite
acquiescence
covered
mixed
feelings
what
had
caused
the
widow
to
change
her
mind
so
suddenly
and
above
all
what
had
she
wished
to
consult
him
about
he
faced
her
more
directly
she
was
charmingly
gowned
and
in
spite
of
his
perplexities
he
could
not
but
admire
her
air
of
quiet
elegance
and
the
soft
dark
eyes
regarding
him
in
friendly
suddenly
realizing
that
his
glance
had
become
a
fixed
stare
he
hastily
averted
his
eyes
from
her
face
catching
sight
as
he
did
so
of
the
gold
mesh
bag
lying
in
her
lap
the
glint
of
sunlight
brought
into
prominence
the
handsomely
engraved
letter
b
on
its
surface
an
unexpected
swerve
of
the
limousine
as
the
chauffeur
turned
short
to
avoid
a
speeding
army
truck
caused
both
kent
and
brewster
to
sway
forward
and
the
gold
mesh
bag
slid
to
the
floor
carrying
with
it
the
widow
handkerchief
and
gold
vanity
box
kent
stooped
over
and
picked
up
the
articles
as
well
as
the
contents
of
the
mesh
bag
which
had
opened
in
its
descent
and
spilled
her
money
and
papers
over
the
floor
of
the
limousine
oh
thank
you
exclaimed
brewster
as
he
handed
her
the
bag
box
and
bank
notes
do
bother
to
look
for
that
quarter
harris
will
find
it
at
the
kent
ignored
her
remark
as
he
again
searched
the
floor
of
the
car
he
was
glad
of
the
pretext
to
avoid
looking
at
the
widow
he
wanted
time
to
collect
his
thoughts
for
in
picking
up
her
belongings
her
handkerchief
had
caught
his
attention
he
had
seen
its
mate
in
the
possession
of
detective
ferguson
and
clinging
to
it
the
broken
portions
of
the
capsules
of
amyl
nitrite
which
jimmie
turnbull
had
inhaled
just
before
his
mysterious
death
into
kent
mind
flashed
sylvester
statement
that
brewster
was
in
the
police
court
at
the
time
of
the
tragedy
although
in
her
testimony
at
the
inquest
she
had
sworn
she
had
not
heard
of
death
until
the
return
of
helen
and
barbara
mcintyre
she
had
been
in
the
police
court
and
jimmie
had
used
her
handkerchief
a
mate
to
the
one
she
was
then
holding
the
letter
b
with
its
peculiar
twist
was
unmistakable
and
b
stood
for
brewster
as
well
as
for
barbara
kent
drew
in
his
breath
sharply
my
handkerchief
please
the
widow
held
out
her
hand
and
after
a
moment
hesitation
kent
gave
it
to
her
pardon
me
he
apologized
i
was
struck
by
the
brewster
turned
it
over
in
what
way
is
the
handkerchief
unique
she
asked
laughing
because
jimmie
turnbull
crushed
amyl
nitrite
capsules
in
its
mate
just
before
he
died
explained
kent
quietly
detective
ferguson
claims
that
jimmie
unintentionally
broke
more
than
one
capsule
in
the
handkerchief
was
overcome
by
the
powerful
fumes
and
but
the
inquest
proved
that
jimmie
was
killed
by
a
dose
of
aconitine
poison
she
reminded
him
as
she
tucked
the
handkerchief
up
her
sleeve
kent
did
not
reply
immediately
a
man
does
not
usually
carry
a
handkerchief
about
with
him
he
commented
slowly
odd
is
it
not
that
jimmie
should
have
used
a
handkerchief
of
yours
in
the
police
court
just
prior
to
his
death
while
you
were
sitting
a
few
feet
away
i
brewster
turned
and
regarded
him
steadfastly
she
was
deadly
white
under
her
rouge
mr
kent
are
you
crazy
yes
crazy
to
know
why
you
kept
your
presence
in
the
police
court
on
tuesday
morning
a
secret
replied
kent
in
their
earnestness
neither
noticed
kent
clutch
on
a
small
folded
paper
which
he
had
picked
up
from
the
floor
of
the
limousine
mrs
brewster
why
did
you
laugh
when
stone
carried
jimmie
turnbull
out
of
the
court
room
brewster
sat
still
in
her
corner
of
the
car
so
still
that
kent
observing
her
closely
feared
that
she
had
fainted
she
had
dropped
her
eyes
and
her
face
set
like
marble
gave
him
no
key
to
her
thoughts
the
door
of
the
limousine
was
jerked
open
almost
before
the
car
came
to
a
full
stop
in
front
of
the
mcintyre
residence
and
colonel
mcintyre
offered
his
hand
to
help
brewster
out
on
the
step
she
turned
to
kent
who
had
lifted
his
hat
to
mcintyre
in
silent
greeting
your
forte
lies
as
a
romancer
rather
than
a
lawyer
kent
she
said
and
not
giving
him
time
for
a
reply
almost
ran
inside
the
house
glad
you
could
get
here
so
soon
kent
remarked
mcintyre
signing
to
his
chauffeur
to
drive
on
before
he
led
the
way
into
the
house
grimes
has
worked
himself
almost
into
a
fever
asking
for
grimes
yes
grimes
was
attacked
in
our
library
early
this
morning
by
some
unknown
person
and
is
in
bed
with
a
bad
wound
on
his
temple
and
a
tendency
to
hysteria
mcintyre
explained
come
kent
handed
his
cane
and
hat
to
the
footman
and
followed
colonel
mcintyre
who
stalked
ahead
without
another
word
as
they
mounted
the
stairs
kent
glanced
at
the
folded
paper
which
he
still
held
and
was
surprised
to
see
that
it
was
a
check
the
signature
showed
him
that
he
had
unintentionally
walked
off
with
brewster
property
his
decision
to
hand
it
to
colonel
mcintyre
was
checked
by
the
colonel
disappearing
inside
a
bedroom
with
a
muttered
injunction
to
wait
there
and
kent
stuffed
the
check
inside
his
vest
pocket
it
would
serve
as
an
excuse
to
interview
brewster
again
before
leaving
the
house
he
was
determined
to
have
an
answer
to
the
question
he
had
put
to
her
in
the
limousine
why
had
she
gone
to
the
police
court
and
why
kept
her
presence
there
a
secret
when
colonel
mcintyre
reappeared
in
the
hall
he
was
accompanied
by
detective
ferguson
sorry
to
keep
you
standing
kent
he
said
i
have
sent
for
you
and
ferguson
first
because
grimes
insists
on
seeing
you
and
second
because
i
am
determined
that
this
midnight
shall
be
thoroughly
investigated
and
put
an
end
to
this
way
and
he
led
them
into
a
large
airy
bedroom
on
the
third
floor
to
which
grimes
had
been
carried
unconscious
that
morning
instead
of
to
his
own
bedroom
in
the
servants
quarters
grimes
with
his
head
swathed
in
bandages
was
a
object
he
greeted
colonel
mcintyre
and
the
detective
with
a
sullen
glare
but
his
eyes
brightened
at
sight
of
kent
and
he
moved
a
feeble
hand
in
welcome
sit
down
sirs
he
mumbled
there
chairs
for
do
worry
about
us
remarked
mcintyre
cheerily
just
tell
us
how
you
got
that
nasty
knock
on
the
i
dunno
sir
it
came
like
a
clap
o
thunder
grimes
tried
to
lift
his
head
but
gave
over
the
attempt
as
excruciating
pain
followed
the
effort
what
hour
of
the
morning
was
it
asked
ferguson
about
one
as
near
as
i
can
tell
and
what
were
you
doing
in
the
library
at
that
hour
grimes
demanded
mcintyre
trying
to
find
out
what
your
household
was
up
to
sir
was
unexpected
answer
and
mcintyre
started
explain
your
meaning
grimes
he
commanded
sternly
you
can
do
it
better
than
i
can
sir
retorted
grimes
you
know
the
reason
every
one
searching
the
room
with
the
seven
the
room
with
the
seven
doors
echoed
ferguson
which
is
that
grimes
means
the
mcintyre
tone
was
short
i
have
no
idea
grimes
what
your
allegations
mean
be
more
the
butler
eyed
him
in
no
friendly
fashion
was
turnbull
arrested
in
that
very
room
he
demanded
and
what
was
he
looking
for
mr
turnbull
presence
has
been
explained
replied
mcintyre
he
came
here
disguised
as
a
burglar
on
a
wager
with
my
daughter
miss
ah
did
he
now
grimes
rising
inflection
indicated
nervous
tension
did
a
man
with
a
bad
heart
come
here
in
the
dead
of
night
for
nothing
but
that
foolishness
grimes
glared
at
his
three
visitors
you
bet
he
ferguson
who
had
followed
the
dialogue
between
mcintyre
and
his
servant
with
deep
attention
addressed
the
excited
man
why
did
turnbull
enter
colonel
mcintyre
library
on
monday
night
disguised
as
a
burglar
he
asked
grimes
by
a
twist
of
his
head
managed
to
regard
the
detective
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
aye
why
did
he
he
repeated
that
what
i
went
to
the
library
last
night
to
find
did
you
discover
anything
the
question
shot
from
mcintyre
and
both
ferguson
and
kent
watched
him
as
they
waited
for
grimes
reply
the
butler
took
his
time
no
mcintyre
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
and
his
eyebrows
rose
in
interrogation
as
he
touched
his
forehead
significantly
and
glanced
at
grimes
that
the
butler
caught
his
meaning
was
evident
from
his
expression
but
he
said
nothing
the
detective
was
the
first
to
speak
did
you
hear
any
one
break
into
the
house
when
you
were
prowling
around
grimes
he
asked
no
the
detective
turned
to
colonel
mcintyre
after
finding
grimes
did
you
search
the
house
he
inquired
yes
the
patrolman
and
my
new
footman
murray
went
with
me
through
the
entire
house
and
we
found
all
doors
and
windows
to
the
front
and
rear
of
the
house
securely
locked
responded
mcintyre
except
the
window
of
the
reception
room
on
the
ground
floor
that
was
closed
but
kent
wondered
if
the
grimace
which
twisted
the
butler
face
was
meant
for
a
smile
that
there
window
was
locked
when
i
went
to
bed
grimes
stated
with
slow
distinctness
and
i
was
the
last
person
in
this
house
to
go
to
my
mcintyre
started
to
speak
when
ferguson
stopped
him
just
let
me
handle
this
case
he
said
persuasively
you
have
called
in
the
police
and
as
mcintyre
commenced
some
uncomplimentary
remark
he
added
with
sternness
do
interfere
sir
now
grimes
your
statements
imply
one
of
two
things
some
member
of
the
household
either
went
downstairs
after
you
had
retired
and
opened
the
window
in
the
reception
room
to
admit
the
person
who
afterwards
attacked
you
in
the
library
or
ferguson
paused
significantly
some
member
of
this
household
knocked
you
senseless
in
the
library
which
was
it
there
was
a
tense
silence
mcintyre
by
an
obvious
effort
refrained
from
speech
as
they
waited
for
grimes
answer
i
dunno
who
hit
grimes
avoided
looking
at
the
three
men
but
some
one
did
and
that
window
in
the
reception
room
was
locked
when
i
went
upstairs
to
my
bedroom
after
every
one
had
retired
i
telling
you
god
truth
mcintyre
eyed
him
in
wrathful
silence
then
turned
to
his
companions
the
blow
has
knocked
grimes
silly
he
commented
there
is
certainly
no
motive
for
any
of
us
to
attack
grimes
nor
has
any
trace
of
a
weapon
been
found
such
as
must
have
been
used
against
grimes
and
i
looked
particularly
for
it
after
removing
grimes
from
the
venetian
casket
where
my
daughter
helen
brewster
and
i
discovered
him
lying
what
this
venetian
casket
like
asked
ferguson
before
kent
could
question
mcintyre
it
is
a
fine
sample
of
carving
of
the
middle
ages
replied
mcintyre
i
purchased
the
pair
when
in
venice
years
ago
they
are
over
six
feet
in
length
about
three
feet
wide
and
rest
on
a
carved
base
there
is
a
door
at
the
end
through
which
it
was
customary
in
the
middle
ages
to
slide
the
body
after
embalming
for
the
funeral
ceremonies
after
which
the
body
was
removed
placed
in
another
casket
and
buried
there
is
a
square
opening
or
peep
hole
on
the
top
of
the
casket
through
which
you
can
look
at
the
body
a
cleverly
concealed
door
covers
this
opening
in
fact
added
mcintyre
the
door
at
the
end
is
not
at
first
discernible
and
is
hard
to
open
unless
one
has
the
knack
of
doing
hum
it
looks
as
if
whoever
put
grimes
inside
the
casket
was
familiar
with
it
remarked
ferguson
dryly
and
mcintyre
bit
his
lip
guess
go
and
take
a
look
at
the
casket
i
come
back
kent
rose
with
the
others
and
started
to
follow
them
to
the
door
but
grimes
beckoned
him
to
approach
the
bed
the
butler
waited
until
he
heard
mcintyre
heavy
tread
and
the
lighter
footfall
of
the
detective
recede
down
the
hall
before
speaking
i
was
only
going
to
say
sir
he
whispered
as
kent
at
a
sign
from
him
stooped
over
the
bed
i
got
a
box
of
aconitine
pills
for
brewster
on
sunday
the
stuff
that
poisoned
turnbull
he
paused
to
explain
yes
go
on
urged
kent
catching
the
man
excitement
you
gave
it
to
brewster
no
sir
i
did
i
left
the
box
on
the
hall
table
grimes
cleared
his
throat
nervously
i
dunno
who
picked
up
that
box
o
poison
kent
so
help
me
god
i
dunno
kent
thought
rapidly
have
you
told
any
one
of
this
he
asked
grimes
nodded
only
one
person
he
admitted
i
spoke
to
miss
barbara
last
night
as
she
was
going
to
grimes
laid
a
hot
hand
on
and
glanced
fearfully
around
the
room
bend
nearer
sir
i
do
want
none
other
to
hear
me
just
before
i
got
that
knockout
blow
in
the
library
last
night
i
heard
the
swish
o
skirts
and
miss
barbara
was
the
only
living
person
who
knew
i
knew
about
the
kent
stared
in
stupefaction
at
the
butler
he
was
aroused
by
a
cold
voice
from
the
doorway
we
are
waiting
for
you
kent
and
colonel
mcintyre
stood
aside
to
let
him
pass
from
the
room
ahead
of
him
then
without
a
backward
glance
at
the
injured
butler
he
closed
and
locked
the
bedroom
door
chapter
xviii
the
fatal
period
as
kent
walked
into
the
library
he
found
colonel
mcintyre
by
his
side
the
latter
even
breathing
gave
no
indication
of
the
haste
he
had
made
down
the
staircase
to
catch
up
with
kent
detective
ferguson
hardly
noted
their
arrival
his
attention
being
given
wholly
to
the
examination
of
the
venetian
casket
which
had
played
such
an
important
part
in
the
drama
of
the
night
before
the
casket
and
its
companion
piece
stood
on
either
side
of
the
room
near
a
window
recess
the
long
straight
shape
of
the
high
boxes
on
their
graceful
base
gave
no
indication
of
the
use
to
which
they
had
been
put
in
ancient
days
but
made
attractive
as
well
as
unique
pieces
of
furniture
kent
crossed
the
library
and
after
looking
inside
the
casket
examined
the
exterior
with
care
do
touch
that
crest
cautioned
ferguson
observing
that
glance
remained
focused
on
the
raised
letter
b
and
the
carving
back
of
it
in
fact
do
touch
any
part
of
the
casket
trying
to
get
finger
kent
barely
heard
the
warning
as
he
turned
to
mcintyre
have
i
seen
that
letter
design
on
your
stationery
colonel
he
asked
barbara
uses
it
was
the
reply
she
fancied
the
antique
lettering
and
copied
the
for
the
engraver
she
is
handy
with
her
pen
you
did
she
wish
the
for
a
seal
inquired
kent
yes
she
had
a
seal
made
like
it
mcintyre
moved
closer
to
the
casket
found
anything
ferguson
the
detective
withdrew
his
head
from
the
opening
at
the
end
of
the
casket
and
regarded
the
furniture
vexedly
not
a
thing
he
acknowledged
except
i
am
convinced
that
it
required
dexterity
to
slip
grimes
inside
the
casket
the
butler
is
small
and
slight
but
he
must
have
been
unconscious
from
that
tap
on
the
forehead
and
therefore
a
dead
weight
whoever
picked
him
up
must
have
been
some
athlete
and
running
his
eyes
up
and
down
colonel
erect
frame
pretty
familiar
with
the
workings
of
this
pooh
it
not
so
difficult
a
feat
mcintyre
shrugged
his
shoulders
disdainfully
my
daughters
as
children
used
to
play
hide
and
seek
inside
the
casket
with
each
new
ferguson
stepped
forward
briskly
mr
kent
let
me
see
if
i
can
lift
you
inside
the
casket
make
yourself
limp
that
it
as
kent
entering
into
the
investigation
heart
and
soul
relaxed
his
muscles
and
fell
back
against
the
detective
a
moment
later
he
was
swung
upward
and
pushed
inside
the
casket
and
the
door
closed
the
air
though
close
was
not
unpleasant
and
kent
his
eyes
growing
gradually
accustomed
to
the
dark
interior
tried
to
discover
the
trap
door
at
the
top
of
the
box
but
without
success
putting
out
his
hands
he
felt
along
the
top
the
height
of
the
casket
did
not
permit
him
to
sit
up
so
he
was
obliged
to
slide
his
body
down
toward
his
feet
to
feel
along
the
sides
of
the
casket
this
maneuver
soon
brought
his
knees
in
violent
contact
with
the
top
and
at
the
sound
ferguson
opened
the
door
and
assisted
him
out
had
enough
of
it
he
asked
viewing
kent
reddened
cheeks
with
faint
amusement
i
wonder
if
grimes
could
breathe
in
there
for
any
lengthy
period
if
so
it
would
help
establish
the
time
which
elapsed
between
his
being
incarcerated
and
your
finding
him
how
so
demanded
mcintyre
well
if
he
could
get
air
and
you
had
discovered
him
at
once
he
have
died
explained
ferguson
if
you
did
find
him
immediately
the
person
who
knocked
him
down
must
have
made
a
lightning
air
does
get
in
the
casket
in
some
way
broke
in
kent
it
was
so
bad
inside
colonel
mcintyre
kent
stopped
a
moment
to
remove
a
piece
of
red
sealing
wax
clinging
to
the
cuff
of
his
suit
it
had
not
been
there
when
he
entered
the
casket
kent
dropped
the
wax
in
his
vest
pocket
as
he
again
addressed
his
host
who
first
discovered
grimes
in
the
casket
mrs
and
what
was
brewster
doing
in
the
library
at
that
hour
glancing
keenly
at
mcintyre
as
he
put
the
question
she
could
not
sleep
and
came
down
for
a
book
explained
the
colonel
ferguson
who
had
walked
several
times
around
the
library
looking
behind
first
one
and
then
the
other
of
the
seven
doors
paused
to
ask
what
attracted
brewster
attention
to
the
casket
the
blood
stain
on
its
side
mcintyre
answered
what
that
ferguson
eyed
mcintyre
incredulously
come
sir
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
she
noticed
that
little
bit
of
a
stain
in
a
dark
room
she
had
an
electric
torch
shortly
but
why
should
she
turn
the
torch
on
this
casket
persisted
the
detective
she
came
to
the
library
for
a
book
and
the
bookcases
are
in
another
part
of
the
quite
so
but
the
book
she
wished
was
lying
on
the
top
of
this
casket
replied
mcintyre
meeting
their
level
looks
with
one
equally
steadfast
i
know
because
i
left
the
book
ferguson
glanced
from
mcintyre
to
kent
and
back
again
at
the
colonel
in
silence
the
explanation
was
pat
i
like
to
talk
with
brewster
he
remarked
dryly
mcintyre
pressed
an
electric
button
the
summons
was
answered
immediately
by
the
new
servant
murray
ask
brewster
if
she
can
see
detective
ferguson
in
the
library
murray
mcintyre
directed
beg
pardon
sir
but
brewster
has
just
gone
out
and
with
a
bow
murray
withdrew
kent
who
had
drawn
forward
a
chair
preparatory
to
sitting
down
and
participating
in
the
interview
with
the
widow
changed
his
mind
i
must
leave
at
once
he
said
after
consulting
his
watch
please
inform
brewster
colonel
that
i
will
be
in
my
office
this
afternoon
and
i
expect
her
to
make
me
the
visit
she
postponed
this
morning
ferguson
turning
back
to
address
the
detective
find
me
at
the
saratoga
for
the
next
hour
good
morning
and
paying
no
attention
to
colonel
mcintyre
request
to
remain
he
left
the
room
there
was
no
one
in
the
hall
and
kent
debated
a
moment
whether
or
not
to
ring
for
the
servant
and
ask
to
see
barbara
but
at
sight
of
the
hall
table
grimes
confidences
recurred
to
him
and
drove
everything
else
out
of
his
mind
stopping
before
the
table
he
contemplated
its
smooth
surface
before
moving
the
few
ornaments
it
held
satisfied
that
no
pillbox
stood
behind
any
of
them
he
pulled
open
the
two
drawers
and
tumbled
their
contents
about
his
efforts
only
brought
to
light
some
cigarette
boxes
matches
a
scratch
pad
or
two
and
old
visiting
cards
kent
shut
the
drawers
picked
up
his
hat
and
took
his
cane
from
the
tall
china
by
the
hall
table
as
he
stepped
through
the
front
doorway
he
caught
sight
of
the
end
of
his
cane
which
he
was
carrying
tucked
under
his
arm
fastened
to
the
ferule
of
the
cane
was
the
round
top
of
a
pill
box
kent
backed
so
swiftly
into
the
house
again
that
his
figure
blocked
the
closing
of
the
front
door
which
he
had
started
to
pull
shut
after
him
letting
the
door
close
gently
he
walked
back
to
the
umbrella
stand
it
was
a
tall
heavy
affair
and
he
had
some
difficulty
in
tipping
it
over
and
letting
its
contents
spill
on
the
floor
a
soft
exclamation
escaped
him
as
three
little
pellets
rolled
past
him
and
then
came
the
bottom
of
a
box
with
hasty
fingers
kent
picked
them
up
placed
them
in
the
box
and
fitted
on
the
top
first
carefully
smoothing
over
the
hole
made
by
his
cane
when
thrust
into
the
umbrella
stand
by
the
footman
replacing
the
stand
he
wrapped
the
box
containing
the
pills
in
his
handkerchief
and
hurried
from
the
house
kent
found
the
operative
from
detective
headquarters
sitting
on
duty
in
rochester
living
room
when
he
entered
that
apartment
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
any
one
called
here
he
asked
as
the
man
whom
he
had
met
the
night
before
greeted
him
not
a
soul
nelson
suppressed
a
yawn
his
relief
was
late
in
coming
and
he
had
had
little
sleep
the
night
before
there
been
no
disturbance
of
any
kind
not
even
a
ring
at
the
kent
considered
a
moment
then
sat
down
by
the
telephone
and
gave
a
number
to
central
that
you
sylvester
he
called
into
the
if
brewster
comes
to
the
office
telephone

at
rochester
apartment
franklin

leave
until
i
have
seen

came
the
reply
and
kent
hung
up
the
receiver
had
any
luncheon
he
asked
nelson
as
the
man
loitered
around
not
yet
nelson
eyes
brightened
at
the
word
it
was
long
past
his
usual
meal
hour
run
down
to
the
cafe
on
the
first
floor
and
tell
the
head
waiter
to
give
you
a
square
meal
and
charge
it
to
me
kent
directed
order
something
substantial
you
must
be
used
the
man
hung
back
thank
you
kent
but
i
do
like
to
leave
here
until
my
relief
comes
he
objected
that
all
right
i
stay
in
the
apartment
until
you
return
and
kent
settled
the
question
by
opening
the
door
leading
into
the
outer
corridor
ferguson
will
be
around
shortly
so
kent
watched
the
man
scurry
toward
the
elevator
shaft
then
returned
to
rochester
apartment
and
once
more
took
up
the
telephone
the
operative
reluctance
to
leave
the
apartment
unguarded
had
altered
his
plans
somewhat
is
this
stone
office
he
asked
a
moment
later
as
a
faint
hello
came
over
the
wire
oh
doctor
this
is
kent
please
come
over
to
rochester
apartment
i
would
like
to
consult
you
in
regard
to
an
important
matter

come
now
the
doctor
kept
kent
waiting
less
than
five
minutes
the
clock
was
striking
one
when
he
appeared
bland
and
smiling
hardly
waiting
for
him
to
select
a
seat
kent
flung
himself
into
a
chair
in
front
of
desk
and
laid
the
pill
box
on
the
writing
pad
now
doctor
he
began
and
his
manner
gained
in
seriousness
what
in
your
opinion
killed
jimmie
turnbull
the
examination
proved
that
he
had
swallowed
aconitine
in
sufficient
quantity
to
cause
death
stone
replied
he
undoubtedly
died
from
the
effects
of
that
is
aconitine
difficult
to
procure
asked
kent
it
is
often
prescribed
for
stone
made
himself
comfortable
in
a
chair
aconitine
is
the
alkaloid
of
aconite
i
believe
that
in
india
it
is
frequently
employed
not
only
for
the
destruction
of
wild
beasts
but
for
criminal
purposes
the
india
variety
is
known
as
the
bish
kent
started
bish
poison
was
he
never
to
get
away
from
the
letter
b
can
you
procure
bish
in
this
country
he
asked
stone
considered
the
question
you
might
be
able
to
purchase
it
from
some
hindoo
residing
or
traveling
in
the
united
states
he
said
after
a
pause
i
doubt
if
you
could
buy
it
in
a
drug
kent
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
as
he
hitched
his
chair
closer
to
the
physician
did
you
prescribe
a
dose
of
aconitine
for
brewster
recently
he
asked
i
did
for
an
attack
of
rheumatic
stone
eyed
him
curiously
what
then
kent
is
this
the
box
the
medicine
came
in
and
kent
placed
the
cover
in
stone
hand
stone
turned
the
over
and
studied
the
defaced
label
i
can
not
answer
that
question
positively
he
said
the
label
bears
my
name
and
that
of
the
druggist
but
the
directions
are
but
the
number
on
it
put
in
kent
swiftly
come
stone
call
up
the
druggist
repeat
the
number
to
him
and
ask
if
it
calls
for
your
aconitine
stone
hesitated
as
if
about
to
speak
then
reaching
out
his
hand
he
picked
up
the
telephone
and
held
a
short
conversation
with
the
drug
clerk
of
the
thompson
pharmacy
that
is
the
box
which
contained
the
aconitine
pills
for
brewster
he
said
when
he
had
replaced
the
telephone
now
kent
i
have
secured
the
information
you
wished
kindly
tell
me
your
reasons
for
desiring
it
was
kent
turn
to
hesitate
do
you
know
many
instances
where
aconitine
was
used
by
murderers
he
questioned
i
believe
it
was
the
drug
used
in
the
celebrated
lamson
poison
case
replied
the
physician
slowly
i
can
not
recall
any
others
just
at
the
how
about
suicides
it
is
seldom
if
ever
used
for
stone
spoke
with
more
assurance
i
have
found
in
my
practice
kent
that
suicides
can
be
classed
as
follows
drowning
by
the
young
pistols
by
the
adult
and
hanging
by
the
aged
women
generally
prefer
asphyxiation
using
illuminating
gas
but
this
is
beside
the
question
unless
bending
a
penetrating
look
at
his
companion
unless
you
believe
jimmie
turnbull
committed
that
idea
has
occurred
to
me
admitted
kent
but
it
does
square
with
other
facts
which
have
developed
nor
is
it
in
keeping
with
the
character
of
the
men
who
suffer
from
a
mortal
disease
sometimes
commit
desperate
acts
not
at
all
in
accord
with
their
previous
conduct
responded
stone
gravely
come
kent
you
have
not
answered
my
question
why
did
you
wish
information
about
this
box
of
aconitine
pills
prescribed
for
brewster
during
her
attack
of
neuralgia
you
have
just
stated
that
aconitine
is
not
usually
administered
to
murder
a
person
kent
spoke
seriously
choosing
his
words
with
care
do
you
wonder
then
that
i
consider
it
more
than
a
coincidence
that
jimmie
turnbull
should
have
died
from
a
dose
of
that
poison
and
that
the
drug
should
have
been
prescribed
for
one
of
the
inmates
of
the
house
he
visited
shortly
before
his
death
the
physician
sat
upright
his
face
had
grown
gray
mr
kent
he
commenced
indignantly
are
you
aware
what
you
are
insinuating
are
you
also
aware
that
brewster
is
my
cousin
a
charming
honorable
woman
without
a
stain
on
her
character
kent
set
the
bottom
of
the
box
containing
the
pills
in
front
of
the
doctor
i
have
found
out
that
this
box
with
its
dangerous
drug
was
left
on
the
hall
table
in
the
mcintyre
house
apparently
any
one
had
access
to
its
contents
therefore
my
remarks
are
not
directed
against
brewster
any
more
than
against
any
person
in
the
mcintyre
household
from
the
colonel
to
the
servants
i
found
these
three
pills
at
the
mcintyre
house
this
morning
how
many
did
your
prescription
call
for
stone
picked
up
the
small
pills
and
as
he
balanced
them
in
his
palm
his
manner
grew
more
alert
suddenly
he
dropped
two
back
in
the
box
and
touched
the
third
pill
with
the
tip
of
his
tongue
not
content
with
that
he
crushed
it
in
his
fingers
sniffed
the
drug
and
again
tested
it
with
his
tongue
his
expression
was
peculiar
as
he
looked
up
at
kent
these
are
not
aconitine
pills
he
stated
positively
they
are
how
did
they
get
in
this
box
kent
rubbed
his
chin
in
bewilderment
the
box
bearing
the
aconitine
label
and
the
pills
had
all
rolled
out
of
the
china
umbrella
stand
and
he
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
the
pills
belonged
in
the
box
i
found
them
loose
in
the
same
receptacle
he
explained
and
concluded
they
were
what
remained
of
the
aconitine
pills
which
grimes
the
mcintyre
butler
said
he
left
on
the
hall
table
sunday
stone
smiled
with
what
kent
who
was
watching
him
closely
judged
to
be
an
odd
mixture
of
relief
and
apprehension
you
could
not
have
found
more
dissimilar
medicine
to
go
in
this
pill
box
although
the
two
kinds
of
pills
are
identical
in
color
and
size
he
said
aconitine
depresses
the
heart
action
while
the
other
stimulates
the
physician
statement
fell
on
deaf
ears
raising
his
head
after
contemplating
the
pills
kent
had
looked
across
the
room
and
his
glance
had
fallen
on
a
wing
chair
standing
just
inside
the
doorway
of
the
living
room
and
thrown
partly
in
shadow
by
the
portieres
the
wing
of
the
chair
appeared
to
move
kent
rubbed
his
eyes
and
looking
again
caught
the
same
slight
movement
bounding
toward
the
chair
kent
saw
that
the
brown
shape
which
he
had
mistaken
for
part
of
the
tufted
upholstery
was
the
sleek
brown
hair
of
a
man
head
he
halted
abruptly
on
meeting
the
gaze
of
a
pair
of
mocking
eyes
rochester
he
gasped
unbelievingly
rochester
his
partner
laughed
softly
as
stone
approached
i
have
been
an
interested
listener
he
said
let
me
complete
the
good
argument
would
have
benefitted
jimmie
turnbull
and
his
feeble
heart
whereas
the
missing
aconitine
pills
killed
stone
regarded
him
with
severity
how
did
you
get
in
this
apartment
he
demanded
declining
the
challenge
rochester
had
offered
in
addressing
his
opinion
of
turnbull
death
directly
to
him
rochester
dangled
his
bunch
of
keys
in
the
physician
face
and
smiled
at
his
excited
partner
if
you
two
had
been
so
absorbed
in
your
conversation
you
would
have
heard
me
walk
in
he
remarked
where
have
you
been
demanded
kent
partly
recovering
from
his
astonishment
which
had
deprived
him
of
speech
i
decided
to
take
a
vacation
at
a
moment
rochester
spoke
with
the
same
slow
drawl
which
was
characteristic
of
him
you
should
be
accustomed
to
my
eccentricities
by
this
time
we
are
announced
detective
ferguson
from
the
hallway
where
he
and
nelson
had
been
silent
witnesses
of
the
scene
and
we
give
you
a
chance
to
explain
them
in
the
police
on
what
charge
demanded
rochester
poisoning
your
turnbull
replied
the
detective
drawing
out
a
pair
of
handcuffs
you
are
mighty
clever
rochester
i
got
to
hand
it
to
you
for
your
mysterious
disappearances
in
and
out
of
this
apartment
and
for
murdering
turnbull
right
in
the
police
court
in
the
presence
of
the
judge
police
officials
and
kent
stepped
forward
at
sight
of
the
handcuffs
and
laid
a
restraining
hand
on
the
detective
shoulder
rochester
saw
the
movement
guessed
kent
intention
and
smiled
we
can
settle
the
case
here
he
said
cheerfully
no
need
of
troubling
the
police
judge
now
detective
how
did
i
kill
jimmie
turnbull
before
all
those
people
without
any
one
becoming
aware
of
the
fact
slipped
the
poison
in
the
glass
of
water
you
handed
him
answered
ferguson
promptly
a
nervy
but
you
swing
for
rochester
smile
was
exasperating
as
he
turned
to
stone
judging
from
stone
remarks
about
aconitine
which
i
overheard
he
interpolated
i
gather
the
doctor
is
tolerably
familiar
with
the
action
of
the
drug
does
aconitine
kill
instantly
doctor
stone
cleared
his
throat
before
speaking
no
the
fatal
period
averages
about
four
hours
he
said
and
rochester
eyes
sparkled
as
he
looked
up
at
the
detective
jimmie
died
almost
immediately
after
i
handed
him
that
drink
of
water
he
declared
if
you
wish
to
know
who
administered
that
aconitine
poison
you
will
have
to
find
out
who
jimmie
was
with
at
the
mcintyre
house
in
the
early
hours
of
tuesday
the
sharp
imperative
ring
of
the
telephone
bell
cut
the
silence
which
followed
kent
standing
nearest
the
instrument
picked
it
up
and
recognized
sylvester
voice
over
the
wire
a
message
has
just
come
kent
he
called
from
brewster
saying
that
she
will
be
in
your
office
at
four
chapter
xix
the
red
seal
again
harry
kent
inserted
his
key
in
his
office
door
with
more
vigor
than
good
judgment
and
spent
some
seconds
in
it
in
the
lock
once
inside
the
office
he
put
up
the
latch
and
closed
the
door
a
glance
around
the
empty
office
showed
him
that
sylvester
had
obeyed
his
telephone
instructions
and
gone
out
to
luncheon
kent
noted
with
satisfaction
as
he
put
his
hat
and
cane
in
the
coat
closet
that
he
had
over
two
hours
before
brewster
expected
arrival
ample
time
in
which
to
consider
in
quietude
the
events
of
the
past
few
days
and
plan
for
his
interview
with
the
pretty
widow
he
had
spent
the
time
between
rochester
sudden
reappearance
and
a
hastily
swallowed
lunch
at
a
downtown
cafe
in
arranging
bail
for
rochester
ferguson
had
proved
obdurate
and
had
persisted
in
taking
the
lawyer
to
police
headquarters
stone
had
accompanied
the
trio
and
his
testimony
supported
by
two
chemists
regarding
the
time
required
for
aconitine
poison
to
act
had
gone
far
to
weaken
the
detective
case
against
rochester
rochester
to
kent
unbounded
astonishment
had
appeared
indifferent
to
the
whole
proceedings
and
to
his
partner
urgent
inquiries
as
to
where
he
had
spent
the
past
four
days
and
why
he
had
disappeared
he
had
returned
one
invariable
answer
i
explain
in
good
time
harry
and
it
was
not
until
they
were
leaving
police
headquarters
that
his
apathy
vanished
when
are
you
to
see
brewster
he
asked
she
will
be
at
our
office
at
four
say
phil
but
rochester
shaking
off
his
detaining
hand
darted
across
the
street
and
sprang
into
a
passing
taxi
bearing
the
sign
for
hire
and
that
was
the
last
kent
had
seen
of
his
elusive
partner
kent
dropped
into
his
chair
and
glanced
askance
at
the
mail
piled
in
neat
array
on
his
desk
he
was
not
in
a
frame
of
mind
to
handle
routine
office
business
other
clients
would
have
to
wait
until
later
in
the
day
a
memorandum
pad
bearing
a
message
in
sylvester
precise
penmanship
attracted
his
wandering
attention
and
he
picked
it
up
mr
kent
he
read
colonel
mcintyre
called
just
after
i
talked
with
you
on
the
he
waited
in
your
office
for
half
an
hour
then
left
stating
he
would
come
back
miss
barbara
mcintyre
called
immediately
afterwards
but
would
not
wait
more
than
five
minutes
clymer
came
as
she
was
going
out
and
left
a
note
on
your
desk
i
will
return
soon
kent
laid
down
the
pad
and
picked
up
a
twisted
note
bearing
his
name
in
pencil
unfolding
it
he
scanned
the
hurriedly
written
lines
dear
kent
mcintyre
telephoned
there
were
new
developments
in
the
turnbull
affair
will
be
back
later
yours
b
kent
judged
from
the
use
of
his
initials
that
clymer
was
stirred
out
of
his
ordinary
calm
nothing
else
explained
his
failure
to
sign
his
full
name
and
he
wondered
what
confidences
mcintyre
had
made
to
the
bank
president
tossing
down
the
note
kent
lighted
his
pipe
tilted
back
in
his
swivel
chair
and
reviewed
the
facts
which
implicated
rochester
in
jimmie
turnbull
murder
rochester
quarrels
with
jimmie
his
persistent
assertion
that
his
friend
had
died
from
angina
pectoris
his
unexplained
disappearance
on
tuesday
night
the
fake
telegram
from
cleveland
stating
he
was
there
the
withdrawal
of
his
bank
deposits
the
forged
checks
his
mysterious
visits
to
his
own
apartment
when
considered
together
presented
a
chain
of
circumstantial
evidence
connecting
him
with
the
crime
but
in
the
light
of
stone
testimony
the
poison
could
not
have
been
administered
in
the
glass
of
water
rochester
had
given
jimmie
in
the
police
four
hours
at
least
had
to
elapse
before
the
fatal
dose
of
aconitine
could
take
effect
four
hours
kent
told
them
off
on
his
fingers
it
placed
the
crime
in
the
mcintyre
house
which
one
of
its
inmates
administered
the
poison
to
jimmie
and
how
had
it
been
done
what
motive
had
prompted
the
cashier
murder
it
was
preposterous
to
think
that
either
of
the
twins
was
guilty
of
the
crime
helen
devotion
to
jimmie
her
insistence
upon
an
autopsy
being
held
indicated
her
innocence
she
had
stated
at
the
inquest
that
she
had
not
known
the
burglar
identity
kent
paused
as
the
thought
occurred
to
him
the
twins
had
swapped
identities
on
the
witness
stand
and
therefore
helen
had
not
been
called
upon
to
answer
that
question
to
the
best
of
his
recollection
she
had
only
been
asked
if
she
had
recognized
jimmie
in
the
court
room
and
not
at
her
home
but
helen
it
was
who
had
summoned
officer
on
discovering
the
burglar
and
had
him
arrested
she
surely
would
never
have
done
so
had
she
guessed
his
identity
as
for
barbara
mcintyre
kent
heart
beat
faster
at
thought
of
the
girl
he
loved
so
well
circumstantial
evidence
had
seemed
for
a
time
to
involve
her
in
the
crime
grimes
outrageous
insinuation
that
he
had
been
assaulted
on
account
of
confiding
to
her
that
the
box
of
aconitine
pills
had
been
left
on
the
hall
table
where
any
one
could
get
them
was
the
outcome
of
his
battered
condition
when
physical
strength
returned
the
butler
would
forget
his
hallucinations
the
handkerchief
with
its
embroidered
letter
b
used
by
jimmie
to
inhale
the
fumes
from
his
amyl
nitrite
capsules
was
finally
traced
to
its
rightful
owner
brewster
and
brewster
was
due
in
his
office
within
a
very
short
time
square
jaw
became
more
pronounced
she
should
not
leave
until
she
had
either
confessed
her
connection
with
turnbull
death
or
established
her
innocence
surely
it
would
be
easy
for
brewster
to
do
so
but
aconitine
had
been
prescribed
for
her
she
was
familiar
with
the
poison
she
had
it
at
hand
she
went
to
the
police
court
and
kept
her
trip
a
secret
and
she
had
laughed
when
jimmie
was
carried
dying
from
the
court
room
but
what
motive
could
have
inspired
her
to
murder
jimmie
was
he
an
old
lover
kent
unable
to
keep
quiet
any
longer
rose
and
paced
up
and
down
the
office
stopping
a
moment
to
glance
out
of
the
window
as
he
passed
the
safe
he
saw
the
door
was
ajar
kent
paused
abruptly
who
had
opened
the
safe
crossing
to
the
outer
office
he
looked
around
no
one
was
there
it
flashed
into
kent
mind
that
he
had
seen
rochester
light
top
coat
and
walking
stick
in
the
coat
closet
as
he
hung
up
his
hat
on
his
arrival
and
he
again
opened
the
closet
door
the
coat
and
stick
were
still
there
so
rochester
had
come
to
the
office
immediately
after
leaving
him
and
carelessly
left
the
safe
open
kent
smiled
in
spite
of
his
vexation
the
act
was
typical
of
his
eccentric
partner
going
back
to
his
own
office
kent
opened
the
safe
and
glanced
inside
the
pigeon
holes
and
compartments
appeared
untouched
except
the
door
of
one
small
compartment
on
rochester
side
an
envelope
was
wedged
in
such
a
manner
that
the
small
door
would
not
shut
and
that
had
prevented
the
closing
of
the
outer
safe
door
kent
preparatory
to
shutting
the
safe
drew
out
the
envelope
intending
to
place
it
in
another
where
there
was
more
room
as
he
turned
the
envelope
over
he
was
thunderstruck
to
recognize
it
as
the
one
which
helen
mcintyre
had
placed
in
the
safe
on
wednesday
morning
he
had
last
seen
the
envelope
lying
on
the
table
in
the
smoking
porch
of
the
club
de
vingt
from
whence
it
had
mysteriously
disappeared
and
now
it
was
back
again
in
rochester
safe
had
it
ever
been
missing
from
the
safe
the
question
forced
itself
on
kent
as
he
returned
to
his
chair
envelope
in
hand
and
sat
down
before
his
desk
he
had
accepted
detective
ferguson
statement
that
he
had
removed
the
envelope
from
the
safe
and
therefore
had
never
looked
in
the
compartment
where
helen
had
put
it
to
verify
its
disappearance
ferguson
had
removed
it
kent
concluded
as
he
examined
the
envelope
with
more
care
it
was
the
identical
one
unaddressed
with
the
same
red
seal
holding
down
the
flap
the
same
red
seal
but
with
a
difference
a
corner
was
missing
kent
stared
at
the
seal
for
a
moment
in
doubt
then
his
fingers
sought
his
vest
pocket
and
fumbled
about
for
a
minute
taking
out
brewster
check
he
laid
it
on
the
desk
alongside
the
envelope
unfolded
it
and
picked
out
a
piece
of
red
sealing
wax
which
had
slid
inside
the
check
kent
placed
the
red
wax
on
the
broken
section
of
the
seal
it
fitted
exactly
forming
a
perfect
letter
kent
sat
in
dumbfounded
silence
regarding
the
red
seal
and
the
envelope
the
piece
of
wax
broken
off
from
the
seal
had
caught
on
his
coat
sleeve
when
he
had
been
in
the
venetian
casket
in
the
library
at
the
mcintyre
house
it
was
proof
positive
that
not
only
he
had
been
in
the
casket
but
the
sealed
envelope
also
helen
mcintyre
had
left
the
envelope
in
his
care
brewster
and
colonel
mcintyre
had
both
been
present
when
the
envelope
was
stolen
from
him
which
of
them
had
taken
it
which
one
had
afterwards
secreted
it
in
the
venetian
casket
and
which
had
brought
it
back
to
the
safe
in
his
office
colonel
mcintyre
had
been
in
his
office
within
the
hour
the
question
was
answered
and
kent
eyes
brightened
then
clouded
barbara
had
been
there
as
well
and
grimes
had
stated
that
before
he
received
a
blow
in
the
mcintyre
library
he
heard
the
swish
of
skirts
kent
laid
his
hand
on
the
envelope
it
was
time
that
he
found
out
what
it
contained
but
his
finger
inserted
under
the
flap
paused
as
his
eyes
fell
on
the
check
bearing
brewster
signature
it
was
the
check
he
had
picked
up
from
the
floor
of
the
mcintyre
limousine
that
morning
and
inadvertently
carried
away
with
him
from
her
signature
his
glance
wandered
to
sylvester
memorandum
pad
it
was
uncanny
the
way
his
eye
picked
out
the
letter
b
as
he
stared
at
clymer
note
and
its
signature
slowly
his
hand
dropped
away
from
the
envelope
and
he
left
it
lying
forgotten
on
the
desk
as
he
picked
up
piece
after
piece
of
blotting
paper
glancing
intently
at
each
and
finally
pulling
open
a
drawer
of
his
desk
he
hunted
in
feverish
haste
for
a
some
ten
minutes
later
kent
rose
placed
the
papers
he
had
been
examining
in
the
inside
pocket
of
his
coat
and
using
the
private
entrance
from
his
office
into
the
corridor
he
hurried
away
when
helen
mcintyre
entered
the
office
of
rochester
and
kent
for
the
second
time
that
afternoon
she
found
sylvester
transcribing
stenographic
notes
on
his
typewriter
mr
kent
is
expecting
you
miss
he
said
holding
open
the
inner
office
door
and
with
a
courteous
word
of
thanks
helen
passed
the
clerk
and
the
door
closed
behind
her
kent
rose
at
her
approach
and
bowed
formally
take
this
chair
he
suggested
and
not
until
she
was
seated
did
helen
realize
he
had
placed
her
where
the
light
fell
full
upon
her
i
asked
you
to
come
here
he
began
as
she
waited
for
him
to
speak
because
i
must
have
your
confidence
if
i
am
to
aid
you
did
you
meet
recognize
and
talk
to
jimmie
turnbull
in
your
house
sometime
between
monday
midnight
and
his
arrest
on
tuesday
morning
she
colored
hotly
then
paled
my
testimony
at
the
inquest
she
commenced
but
he
gave
her
no
opportunity
to
add
more
your
testimony
there
does
not
cover
the
question
he
explained
you
stated
then
that
you
had
not
recognized
jimmie
in
the
court
room
had
you
already
penetrated
his
disguise
at
your
house
and
if
i
had
did
you
kent
was
doggedly
persistent
and
helen
fingers
closed
around
her
handbag
with
convulsive
force
why
had
she
not
sent
barbara
to
see
kent
in
her
place
did
i
what
she
parried
did
you
recognize
and
talk
with
jimmie
turnbull
in
your
house
i
talked
with
him
yes
she
admitted
and
her
voice
dropped
almost
to
a
whisper
as
jimmie
turnbull
or
smith
the
burglar
as
jimmie
she
confessed
after
a
slight
pause
then
why
did
you
go
through
the
farce
of
having
jimmie
arrested
as
a
burglar
kent
demanded
so
that
barbara
might
win
her
wager
promptly
kent
stared
at
her
incredulously
do
you
mean
that
notwithstanding
the
risk
to
which
you
were
subjecting
him
with
his
weak
heart
you
kept
up
the
farce
simply
that
barbara
might
win
an
idiotic
wager
kent
asked
helen
passed
one
nervous
hand
over
the
other
her
palms
were
hot
and
dry
and
two
hectic
spots
had
appeared
in
each
white
cheek
jimmie
was
quite
well
monday
night
she
protested
he
he
had
some
heart
medicine
with
amyl
nitrite
i
i
think
that
was
it
i
am
not
quite
sure
she
spoke
with
uncertainty
and
kent
knew
that
she
lied
his
heart
sank
did
he
swallow
any
medicine
in
your
presence
she
shook
her
head
vigorously
no
he
did
kent
lowered
his
voice
did
you
see
him
take
brewster
aconitine
pills
off
the
hall
table
helen
shifted
her
gaze
to
his
face
and
then
back
to
her
ever
restless
hands
no
she
said
i
did
not
see
him
take
the
kent
studied
her
in
a
silence
which
to
her
seemed
i
want
the
true
answer
to
this
question
he
announced
with
meaning
emphasis
why
did
jimmie
go
in
disguise
to
your
house
on
monday
night
helen
blanched
how
should
i
know
she
muttered
evasively
he
he
did
come
to
see
me
the
admission
was
barely
above
a
whisper
but
you
know
what
transpired
in
your
house
on
monday
night
demanded
kent
eagerly
his
question
met
with
no
response
and
he
repeated
it
but
still
the
girl
remained
silent
kent
gave
her
a
moment
grace
then
drawing
out
the
unaddressed
envelope
from
his
pocket
he
held
it
toward
her
a
low
cry
broke
from
her
and
her
expression
changed
as
she
caught
sight
of
the
broken
seal
you
have
opened
it
not
yet
kent
held
the
envelope
just
beyond
her
reach
i
will
only
give
it
to
you
with
the
understanding
that
you
open
the
envelope
now
in
my
presence
and
let
me
see
its
helen
drew
back
then
impulsively
extended
her
hand
i
agree
she
said
give
me
the
stop
the
word
rang
out
startling
kent
as
well
as
helen
and
brewster
whose
noiseless
entrance
a
few
seconds
before
had
gone
unobserved
hurried
to
them
the
envelope
is
chapter
xx
the
unknown
equation
no
no
protested
helen
vehemently
you
shall
not
give
the
envelope
to
margaret
you
must
it
is
mine
insisted
the
widow
with
equal
vehemence
mrs
kent
withheld
the
envelope
from
both
women
will
you
tell
me
the
contents
of
this
envelope
no
curtly
it
is
not
your
it
is
my
affair
retorted
kent
with
equally
shortness
of
manner
i
insist
on
an
answer
to
my
questions
in
the
limousine
this
morning
how
came
your
handkerchief
in
jimmie
possession
and
why
did
you
go
to
the
police
court
and
yet
keep
your
presence
there
a
secret
jimmie
must
have
picked
up
the
handkerchief
when
in
the
mcintyre
house
she
answered
sullenly
i
presume
he
forgot
to
provide
him
self
with
one
in
his
as
burglar
as
regards
your
second
question
i
admit
i
did
go
to
the
police
court
out
of
curiosity
i
wanted
to
find
out
what
was
going
on
you
with
a
resentful
glance
at
helen
treated
me
as
an
outsider
and
i
was
determined
to
find
out
for
myself
how
the
burglar
farce
would
ah
you
term
it
a
farce
is
that
why
you
laughed
in
court
asked
kent
quickly
brewster
changed
color
i
feel
badly
about
that
she
stammered
i
meant
no
disrespect
to
jimmie
but
i
have
a
nervous
inclination
to
laugh
almost
hysteria
when
excited
and
i
see
answered
kent
slowly
he
was
distinctly
puzzled
brewster
air
of
candor
disarmed
suspicion
but
you
saw
and
talked
with
jimmie
turnbull
on
monday
night
i
did
her
denial
was
firm
then
how
did
you
learn
of
his
arrest
asked
kent
swiftly
i
overheard
him
conversing
with
whom
kent
demanded
eagerly
as
she
paused
as
if
to
reconsider
her
confidences
helen
one
hand
on
the
desk
and
the
other
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
tried
to
rise
but
her
strength
had
deserted
her
with
whom
repeated
kent
as
the
widow
remained
silent
jimmie
was
talking
with
grimes
brewster
stated
slowly
from
what
i
overheard
he
paid
grimes
to
let
him
inside
the
kent
looked
perplexed
as
he
gazed
first
at
the
widow
and
then
at
helen
who
had
sunk
back
in
her
chair
mrs
brewster
he
began
after
a
pause
who
gave
jimmie
your
aconitine
pills
which
grimes
left
on
the
hall
table
the
yes
of
kent
was
watching
her
closely
and
he
detected
the
tiny
beads
of
perspiration
which
were
gathering
on
her
upper
lip
and
who
in
your
opinion
was
the
murderer
brewster
expression
changed
she
looked
hunted
and
her
eyes
fell
before
kent
abruptly
she
turned
her
back
on
him
to
find
colonel
mcintyre
at
her
elbow
and
barbara
just
entering
the
room
her
eyes
traveled
past
the
girl
until
they
rested
on
philip
rochester
and
detective
ferguson
hovering
behind
him
her
face
altered
i
saw
philip
rochester
pointing
dramatically
toward
him
crawl
out
of
the
reception
room
window
and
dart
into
the
street
just
as
came
in
the
front
door
with
detective
ferguson
could
not
restrain
a
joyful
exclamation
so
that
was
it
he
cried
you
were
at
the
mcintyre
house
and
gave
the
poison
to
turnbull
there
and
not
in
the
court
room
four
hours
before
he
died
you
swing
for
that
crime
my
buck
in
spite
of
your
glib
tongue
and
slippery
as
he
ceased
speaking
ferguson
ever
ready
handcuffs
swung
suggestively
from
his
hand
but
helen
agonized
cry
checked
his
approach
toward
rochester
who
stood
stolidly
waiting
for
him
father
you
can
not
permit
this
monstrous
injustice
philip
shall
not
suffer
for
another

her
sister

advanced
as
the
door
opened
and
sylvester
ushered
in
benjamin
clymer
you
have
come
in
time
clymer
his
voice
deepened
the
voice
of
a
man
accustomed
to
present
a
case
and
sway
a
court
wait
sylvester
sit
at
that
table
and
take
down
these
charges
charges
questioned
kent
watching
his
partner
narrowly
he
tossed
a
stenographic
pad
to
sylvester
and
made
a
place
for
him
at
his
desk
go
on
rochester

against

occupying

stated
with
slow
emphasis
jimmie
turnbull
learned
that
you
clymer
were
to
visit
colonel
mcintyre
on
monday
night
and
he
went
there
in
disguise
to
find
out
if
his
suspicions
were
correct
the
investigation
cost
him
his
clymer
who
had
followed
rochester
statement
first
with
bewilderment
and
then
with
rising
wrath
found
his
voice
you
drunken
scoundrel
he
roared
how
dare
you
dare
rochester
laughed
recklessly
jimmie
kept
his
wits
to
the
last
his
mind
was
clear
he
recognized
you
in
the
prisoner
pen
and
he
tried
to
call
you
but
his
palsied
tongue
could
not
say
ben
but
stuttered
b

and
what
did
he
wish
to
tell
me
gasped
clymer
down
whose
colorless
face
perspiration
trickled
aye
what
broke
in
kent
significantly
jimmie
may
not
have
gotten
the
information
he
wished
at
your
house
colonel
mcintyre
but
his
presence
there
on
monday
night
showed
the
forger
he
was
in
danger
and
like
the
human

he
is

poisoned
without
warning

sylvester
with
a
backward
spring
kent
caught
his
clerk
as
he
sped
for
the
door
do
make
any
mistake
in
putting
on
the
handcuffs
this
time
ferguson
he
shouted
a
forger
and
a
contortionist
make
a
bad
customer
to
reckon
chapter
xxi
the
riddle
answered
there
was
absolute
stillness
in
the
room
then
a
babble
of
exclamations
broke
out
as
sylvester
his
expression
of
dumb
surprise
giving
place
to
one
of
fury
struggled
to
free
himself
from
the
detective
firm
grip
you
can
not
escape
sylvester
declared
kent
observing
his
efforts
your
carelessness
in
using
your
peculiar
gift
of
penmanship
in
copying
barbara
mcintyre
signature
in
this
memorandum
of
her
visit
here
kent
held
up
a
sheet
torn
from
his
pad
gave
me
the
first
clew
these
the
second
he
showed
several
pieces
of
blotting
paper
freshly
used
see
in
the
mirror
here
is
reflected
the
impression
from
your
clever
imitations
of
the
handwritings
of
barbara
colonel
mcintyre
and
they
crowded
about
kent
all
but
ferguson
and
his
prisoner
who
had
subsided
in
his
chair
with
what
the
detective
concluded
was
dangerous
quietude
my
next
step
now
that
suspicion
was
directed
against
sylvester
was
to
make
personal
inquiries
regarding
him
went
on
kent
judge
hildebrand
who
had
just
returned
to
washington
said
that
he
first
met
sylvester
at
a
circus
sideshow
where
he
gave
exhibitions
as
a
contortionist
one
of
his
special
stunts
was
to
slip
out
of
handcuffs
and
so
that
explains
last
night
ferguson
grinned
you
not
do
it
again
sylvester
and
he
shook
an
admonitory
finger
at
the
erstwhile
clerk
judge
hildebrand
became
interested
in
sylvester
found
he
was
handy
with
his
pen
and
tired
of
the
show
business
and
gave
him
an
opening
by
engaging
him
as
confidential
clerk
continued
kent
you
will
recall
colonel
mcintyre
that
you
sent
business
papers
in
your
handwriting
and
that
of
your
daughters
to
judge
hildebrand
office
to
be
typed
by
his
staff
that
is
how
sylvester
became
so
well
acquainted
with
your
writing
and
was
able
to
forge
a
letter
to
the
bank
treasurer
directing
him
to
turn
over
your
negotiable
securities
to
jimmie
but
how
in
the
world
did
sylvester
induce
jimmie
to
present
the
forged
letter
asked
colonel
mcintyre
kent
turned
to
the
sullen
prisoner
answer
that
question
sylvester
he
commanded
and
the
man
roused
himself
from
his
dejected
attitude
anything
in
it
for
me
if
i
do
he
asked
with
a
cunning
leer
that
for
the
courts
to
decide
declared
kent
the
man
thought
a
minute
i
take
a
chance
he
said
finally
but
that
i
waited
for
an
opportunity
to
get
my
swag
out
of
this
safe
i
would
have
been
caught
curse
you
and
he
scowled
at
kent
cut
that
out
admonished
ferguson
with
a
none
too
gentle
dig
in
the
ribs
and
sylvester
continued
his
statement
i
overheard
colonel
mcintyre
tell
judge
hildebrand
about
his
securities
and
their
present
value
and
the
next
day
he
came
to
consult
the
judge
about
engaging
a
secretary
i
fixed
up
credentials
and
went
to
turnbull
he
believed
my
story
that
i
was
the
colonel
new
secretary
and
got
the
sylvester
paused
if
i
rested
content
with
that
success
i
been
all
right
he
added
but
i
was
in
too
great
a
hurry
and
forged
clymer
signature
to
a
check
for
five
thousand
dollars
and
presented
it
at
the
metropolis
trust
company
as
luck
would
have
it
turnbull
cashed
it
for
me
but
did
he
suspect
you
exclaimed
clymer
he
had
gradually
recovered
from
the
shock
of
rochester
charges
on
his
arrival
and
was
listening
with
keen
attention
to
sylvester
confession
no
i
made
the
check
payable
to
colonel
mcintyre
and
forged
his
endorsement
sylvester
spoke
with
an
air
of
pride
and
he
smiled
in
malicious
enjoyment
as
catching
his
eye
barbara
shrank
back
and
sheltered
herself
behind
kent
mr
turnbull
accepted
the
check
later
something
must
have
aroused
his
suspicions
and
i
found
when
he
questioned
me
that
he
believed
colonel
mcintyre
had
forged
the
good
heavens
you
let
him
think
that
gasped
mcintyre
then
wrath
gained
the
mastery
you
scoundrel
oh
i
encouraged
him
to
think
it
sylvester
grinned
again
you
must
have
handed
turnbull
a
raw
deal
he
was
so
ready
to
think
evil
of
that
is
a
lie
exclaimed
helen
hotly
when
i
went
downstairs
to
investigate
the
noise
i
heard
in
the
library
father
jimmie
told
me
who
he
was
to
quiet
my
fright
he
showed
me
a
letter
which
he
had
just
found
on
your
desk
in
the
library
confessing
that
you
had
forged
clymer
name
on
the
check
and
begging
jimmie
to
conceal
your
crime
and
save
barbara
and
me
from
the
shame
of
having
you
exposed
as
a
forger
and
a
i
never
wrote
such
a
letter
shouted
mcintyre
deeply
incensed
no
it
was
a
clever
plan
acknowledged
sylvester
on
one
of
my
trips
to
your
house
colonel
mcintyre
i
secured
wax
impressions
of
your
front
door
lock
i
went
to
your
house
monday
night
and
put
the
letter
among
your
papers
just
before
turnbull
was
admitted
by
your
fool
of
a
and
you
gave
jimmie
turnbull
a
dose
of
poison
charged
kent
but
sylvester
his
lips
gone
dry
raised
his
manacled
hands
in
protest
i
did
not
poison
him
he
cried
i
waited
just
to
see
if
turnbull
got
the
letter
and
to
find
out
what
he
do
with
the
securities
which
he
had
refused
to
turn
over
to
me
after
he
had
read
the
forged
letter
turnbull
acted
sort
of
faint
and
went
out
in
the
hall
i
could
just
see
him
put
down
a
box
on
the
hall
table
and
lean
against
the
wall
then
he
went
into
the
dining
room
and
came
back
a
second
later
carrying
a
glass
of
water
and
i
saw
him
take
up
and
open
a
small
box
and
toss
some
white
pills
into
his
mouth
then
he
took
a
good
drink
and
picking
up
a
handkerchief
lying
on
the
table
he
went
back
into
the
there
was
silence
as
sylvester
callous
recital
of
the
tragedy
ended
helen
her
eyes
tearless
and
dark
with
suffering
sank
slowly
back
in
her
chair
and
rested
her
head
against
barbara
sympathetic
shoulder
so
turnbull
death
was
accidental
after
all
exclaimed
ferguson
or
was
it
suicide
accident
answered
kent
i
found
some
pills
in
the
umbrella
stand
by
the
hall
colonel
mcintyre
nodded
evidently
turnbull
put
down
his
pill
box
before
getting
a
glass
of
water
and
in
his
attack
of
giddiness
accidentally
opened
your
box
of
aconitine
pills
brewster
instead
of
his
own
and
swallowed
a
fatal
dose
thinking
they
were
brewster
bowed
her
head
in
agreement
that
must
have
been
it
she
said
however
i
saw
colonel
mcintyre
tear
off
the
paper
wrapping
and
open
my
package
of
pills
just
before
dinner
and
when
i
heard
that
jimmie
had
died
from
aconitine
i
i
she
stammered
and
stopped
short
you
suspected
i
had
murdered
him
asked
mcintyre
softly
yes
she
looked
appealingly
at
him
forgive
me
i
should
never
have
suspected
you
but
the
pills
box
and
all
were
missing
the
next
morning
from
the
hall
turnbull
must
have
thrown
the
box
into
the
umbrella
stand
explained
kent
that
was
where
i
found
it
did
you
get
the
securities
sylvester
turning
to
the
prisoner
no
sullenly
she
did
and
a
jerk
of
his
thumb
indicated
helen
mcintyre
helen
raised
her
head
and
addressed
them
slowly
jimmie
and
i
expected
barbara
to
come
in
at
any
moment
and
he
started
to
leave
when
we
saw
you
coming
downstairs
she
turned
to
brewster
jimmie
declared
that
if
we
were
found
together
i
might
be
compromised
he
could
explain
his
presence
without
exposing
father
we
both
thought
you
a
forger
father
she
interpolated
as
mcintyre
took
her
hand
and
pressed
it
understandingly
so
he
insisted
that
i
should
treat
him
like
an
ordinary
burglar
we
had
both
forgotten
barbara
silly
wager
in
our
horror
about
father
jimmie
did
dare
take
the
securities
and
father
confession
with
him
for
fear
he
be
searched
at
the
police
station
and
the
scandal
would
have
come
out
true
agreed
mcintyre
go
on
so
jimmie
thrust
the
securities
and
father
confession
into
an
envelope
and
sealed
it
with
red
wax
using
barbara
seal
explained
helen
he
had
time
to
write
an
address
or
message
on
it
but
he
told
me
to
return
the
envelope
to
him
later
in
the
day
or
give
it
to
philip
rochester
and
ask
his
aid
i
brought
it
here
on
wednesday
morning
and
with
harry
permission
put
the
envelope
in
the
i
tried
to
get
it
from
there
volunteered
sylvester
for
i
overheard
turnbull
plan
before
i
left
by
the
reception
room
so
it
was
you
and
not
rochester
whom
i
saw
steal
out
of
the
window
exclaimed
brewster
it
not
the
first
time
i
been
mistaken
for
him
exclaimed
sylvester
calmly
kent
started
and
gazing
at
rochester
and
the
clerk
saw
there
was
a
general
resemblance
in
coloring
and
physique
did
you
present
the
checks
to
mcdonald
at
the
metropolis
trust
company
bearing
rochester
and
my
forged
signatures
he
asked
i
did
acknowledged
sylvester
mr
rochester
wardrobe
came
in
very
handy
for
deceiving
the
casual
glance
you
know
make
the
man
and
want
of
it
the
fellow
kent
looked
up
quickly
struck
by
an
idea
sylvester
did
you
steal
the
envelope
containing
the
securities
from
me
at
the
club
de
vingt
he
asked
sylvester
shook
his
head
no
but
she
did
pointing
to
brewster
it
no
lie
as
mcintyre
uttered
an
indignant
denial
when
ferguson
left
here
carrying
off
the
securities
from
under
my
nose
almost
i
had
spent
the
whole
day
trying
to
learn
the
safe
combination
i
trailed
him
to
the
club
de
vingt
and
heard
the
head
waiter
tell
him
you
kent
were
sitting
in
the
small
smoking
porch
so
i
climbed
up
the
trumpet
vine
oh
it
was
strong
and
no
climb
for
one
who
has
done
the
feats
i
have
in
the
circus
i
reached
the
porch
just
in
time
to
see
brewster
drop
her
fan
and
when
the
men
bent
to
pick
it
up
she
the
envelope
and
concealed
it
under
her
do
brewster
laid
a
detaining
hand
on
mcintyre
as
he
stepped
forward
the
man
is
telling
the
truth
i
thought
it
was
the
envelope
you
gave
me
earlier
in
the
evening
it
was
unaddressed
and
the
red
seal
was
the
just
a
moment
interrupted
kent
what
did
you
do
with
the
envelope
when
i
returned
home
i
dropped
it
inside
one
of
the
venetian
caskets
brewster
replied
no
one
ever
went
near
them
and
i
thought
it
would
be
safe
there
you
see
i
was
puzzled
to
know
how
it
had
disappeared
from
the
desk
in
the
reception
room
where
i
had
left
it
in
one
of
the
pigeon
holes
intending
to
take
it
later
to
my
i
took
the
envelope
your
envelope
out
of
the
desk
confessed
mcintyre
i
would
have
spoken
of
it
margaret
but
was
hurt
that
you
had
left
our
marriage
certificate
lying
around
so
your
what
barbara
sprang
up
astounded
our
marriage
certificate
repeated
mcintyre
firmly
margaret
and
i
were
married
last
week
in
baltimore
we
would
have
told
you
helen
but
your
peculiar
conduct
and
barbara
so
angered
me
that
i
forbade
margaret
to
take
you
into
our
father
barbara
got
no
further
for
helen
had
risen
she
spoke
with
quiet
dignity
you
forget
father
that
since
monday
night
we
have
thought
you
a
forger
and
worse
a
murderer
her
voice
faltered
in
our
effort
to
guard
you
we
have
become
estranged
margaret
she
held
out
her
hand
with
an
affectionate
gesture
and
with
a
sob
her
kissed
her
how
did
this
envelope
get
back
inside
our
safe
asked
kent
a
moment
later
picking
it
up
and
displaying
the
red
seal
intact
save
for
the
broken
corner
i
went
downstairs
about
midnight
or
a
little
later
and
into
the
library
confessed
helen
what
was
my
surprise
and
terror
to
see
grimes
holding
the
envelope
to
me
it
meant
father
exposure
as
a
forger
i
had
a
revolver
in
my
hand
and
struck
before
i
thought
then
i
must
temporarily
have
lost
my
reason
it
was
only
my
thought
to
save
father
that
lent
me
courage
and
strength
to
thrust
grimes
inside
the
casket
where
babs
and
i
used
to
hide
i
then
returned
to
my
room
and
was
just
coming
downstairs
again
after
secreting
the
envelope
to
release
grimes
and
get
medical
assistance
if
need
be
when
screams
aroused
the
mcintyre
interrupted
his
daughter
with
a
hasty
gesture
and
addressed
his
wife
when
detective
ferguson
questioned
me
as
to
your
reason
for
being
in
the
library
margaret
i
stated
you
had
gone
down
to
get
a
book
left
lying
on
the
venetian
casket
he
said
i
waited
for
you
to
volunteer
an
explanation
of
your
presence
there
but
you
never
made
i
went
down
to
get
our
marriage
margaret
forgot
the
presence
of
others
and
spoke
only
to
him
the
in
her
eyes
pleading
against
the
censure
she
dreaded
as
she
made
her
brief
confession
mr
clymer
sent
me
a
note
inclosing
a
canceled
check
stating
the
bank
officials
had
decided
my
signature
was
a
forgery
the
check
was
drawn
to
barbara
and
on
examining
it
i
noticed
the
peculiar
formation
of
the
letter
it
is
characteristic
of
your
handwriting
and
she
paused
and
added
i
was
at
a
loss
what
to
think
i
knew
you
and
helen
wrote
alike
helen
extraordinary
behavior
to
me
led
me
to
believe
that
perhaps
she
had
been
short
of
funds
and
forged
my
name
to
a
check
in
desperation
then
i
remembered
seeing
you
charles
open
the
box
containing
my
aconitine
pills
the
box
disappearance
and
jimmie
death
from
that
poison
she
raised
her
hands
in
an
expressive
gesture
although
my
reason
told
me
that
you
might
be
guilty
my
loyalty
and
love
refuted
the
margaret
mcintyre
voice
shook
with
emotion
then
controlling
himself
he
turned
to
sylvester
i
presume
this
check
was
some
more
of
your
deviltry
helen
answered
for
the
clerk
removing
a
soiled
paper
from
her
bag
she
laid
it
on
kent
desk
this
note
was
handed
to
me
by
grimes
she
explained
it
reads
please
cash
this
check
and
give
money
to
brewster
dressmaker
father
i
followed
the
and
gave
the
money
to
my
sister
sylvester
chuckled
at
their
surprise
my
sister
was
taught
in
a
french
convent
and
she
is
an
excellent
seamstress
when
she
is
drunk
as
mcintyre
see
here
sylvester
clymer
broke
his
long
silence
you
were
in
the
police
court
on
a
charge
of
assault
and
battery
brought
by
your
wife
on
tuesday
morning
and
you
were
in
the
prisoner
cage
at
the
moment
turnbull
died
how
then
was
it
possible
for
you
to
be
at
the
at
midnight
on
monday
i
was
out
on
bail
and
appeared
in
the
courtroom
just
in
time
for
my
trial
sylvester
explained
i
did
not
have
to
sit
in
the
cage
but
recognizing
turnbull
i
went
there
to
be
with
kent
placed
the
forged
check
bearing
margaret
brewster
signature
on
the
desk
i
take
it
this
check
is
your
work
sylvester
he
said
you
reaped
the
benefit
by
having
the
money
paid
to
your
sister
did
you
also
have
the
fake
telegram
delivered
to
me
stating
rochester
was
in
cleveland
i
faked
that
broke
in
rochester
before
the
clerk
could
make
a
disclaimer
i
thought
it
best
to
disappear
for
a
few
days
down
in
virginia
where
i
could
think
things
over
in
so
it
was
you
sylvester
and
not
rochester
whom
i
encountered
in
his
apartment
exclaimed
kent
how
did
you
get
in
the
apartment
from
the
and
along
the
window
ledge
to
the
bathroom
sylvester
hitched
his
shoulders
it
was
nothing
for
a
man
of
my
ferguson
eyed
him
with
doubtful
respect
you
have
courage
he
admitted
grudgingly
come
we
must
get
to
headquarters
and
he
aided
sylvester
to
his
feet
but
once
standing
sylvester
refused
to
move
instead
he
turned
to
helen
what
was
that
you
passed
to
rochester
in
the
police
court
and
he
later
gave
to
turnbull
he
asked
oh
do
deny
it
i
saw
you
palm
a
note
rochester
from
the
young
there
is
nothing
now
to
conceal
declared
helen
after
and
jimmie
left
the
house
for
the
police
station
i
grew
fearful
that
jimmie
might
his
strength
in
carrying
out
the
farce
of
his
arrest
so
as
soon
as
i
could
i
telephoned
to
philip
to
meet
me
at
the
police
court
and
to
bring
some
amyl
nitrite
capsules
with
and
the
note
sylvester
which
you
saw
miss
mcintyre
give
me
in
court
concluded
rochester
as
helen
paused
told
me
to
hand
the
capsules
to
the
burglar
and
to
defend
him
in
court
i
did
both
although
badly
puzzled
by
the
rochester
hesitated
i
carried
out
your
wishes
helen
without
question
but
when
the
burglar
identity
was
revealed
i
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
you
had
used
me
as
an
instrument
to
kill
him
for
i
knew
something
of
the
effects
of
amyl
great
heavens
exclaimed
helen
aghast
rochester
looked
at
her
and
bit
his
lip
he
knew
of
her
affection
for
jimmie
and
her
attachment
to
his
memory
but
he
could
not
kill
the
hope
that
when
time
had
healed
the
loss
his
devotion
might
some
day
win
her
for
his
own
i
did
you
great
injustice
he
admitted
humbly
but
i
was
fearfully
shocked
by
the
scene
i
strove
to
divert
suspicion
by
insisting
that
jimmie
died
from
angina
pectoris
and
then
you
came
helen
and
demanded
an
i
had
to
helen
broke
in
i
could
not
believe
that
jimmie
death
was
due
to
natural
causes
her
voice
quivered
he
had
been
so
loyal
so
faithful
i
could
not
be
less
true
to
him
even
if
as
i
feared
my
own
dear
father
was
guilty
of
the
kent
turned
and
faced
sylvester
who
had
made
a
few
shuffling
steps
toward
the
door
you
have
done
incalculable
harm
by
your
criminal
acts
he
said
sternly
but
for
your
lying
and
trickery
jimmie
turnbull
would
be
alive
i
trust
the
court
will
give
you
the
maximum
sylvester
eyed
him
insolently
i
had
a
run
for
my
money
and
i
stood
to
win
large
sums
if
things
had
only
gone
right
he
announced
then
addressed
helen
directly
what
did
you
do
with
the
securities
i
put
the
envelope
back
in
the
open
safe
when
i
was
here
early
this
afternoon
she
explained
an
oath
ripped
from
sylvester
i
mistook
you
for
your
sister
he
snarled
had
i
known
it
was
you

have
wrung
the
securities
from
helen
stared
at
his
suddenly
contorted
face
ah
you
are
the
man
who
looked
in
at
the
window
of
the
reception
room
yesterday
morning
when
i
was
talking
to
kent
she
cried
i
recognize
you
he
continued
to
glare
at
her
i
also
sent
you
a
note
by
your
sister
outside
the
cafe
marks
to
secrete
the
letter
his
voice
rose
almost
into
a
shout
in
his
ungovernable
rage
i
heard
turnbull
tell
you
to
take
the
envelope
to
rochester
and
i
banked
on
your
bringing
it
here
or
to
his
apartment
you
you
thwarted
me
at
every
rochester
powerful
hand
was
clapped
across
his
mouth
with
such
force
that
the
clerk
staggered
against
ferguson
here
you
out
you
the
detective
shoved
the
struggling
man
toward
the
door
leading
into
the
corridor
and
clymer
sprang
to
his
assistance
a
second
later
rochester
closed
the
door
on
their
receding
figures
and
found
helen
standing
by
his
elbow
i
must
go
she
said
turning
back
to
look
at
her
father
and
his
bride
wait
a
kent
held
up
an
envelope
with
its
fateful
red
seal
this
was
delivered
empty
at
rochester
apartment
last
night
it
is
addressed
to
him
who
wrote
it
i
did
exclaimed
mcintyre
i
felt
i
must
consult
either
you
kent
or
rochester
so
i
sent
the
note
to
his
apartment
but
the
messenger
boy
hurried
me
and
it
was
not
until
hours
later
that
i
found
the
note
lying
on
the
desk
in
the
reception
room
and
realized
i
had
sent
an
empty
i
kent
held
up
another
envelope
the
red
seal
broken
at
the
corner
this
is
yours
helen
hesitated
perceptibly
before
taking
the
envelope
and
tearing
it
open
she
handed
the
securities
to
her
father
here
is
father
forged
confession
she
said
as
she
took
the
remaining
paper
from
the
envelope
it
is
a
marvelous
imitation
of
my
handwriting
declared
mcintyre
looking
at
it
carefully
then
tearing
it
into
tiny
bits
he
flung
them
into
the
and
pocketed
the
securities
and
to
think
that
i
aided
sylvester
plot
to
gain
the
securities
by
engaging
him
as
our
clerk
groaned
rochester
it
was
clever
of
him
to
seek
employment
here
agreed
kent
but
like
many
crooks
he
himself
through
must
you
go
colonel
mcintyre
mcintyre
walked
over
to
helen
my
dear
little
girl
he
began
and
his
voice
was
husky
with
feeling
how
can
i
show
my
appreciation
of
your
loyalty
to
me
by
being
kind
to
harry
and
helen
smiled
bravely
although
her
lips
were
trembling
and
for
a
moment
she
could
not
trust
herself
to
speak
my
romance
is
over
barbara
is
just
beginning
and
father
will
you
and
margaret
come
home
with
me
i
am
so
lonely
then
turning
blindly
away
she
fairly
ran
out
of
the
office
go
with
her
said
rochester
a
trifle
unsteadily
it
has
been
a
terrible
ordeal
god
help
her
to
forget
his
voice
failed
and
he
swept
his
hand
across
his
eyes
as
he
held
open
the
door
into
the
corridor
and
followed
mcintyre
and
his
wife
outside
kent
turned
impulsively
to
barbara
and
his
arms
closed
around
her
as
she
raised
her
eyes
to
meet
his
for
she
knew
that
the
promise
they
spoke
would
be
loyally
fulfilled
and
that
her
haven
of
love
and
happiness
was
reached
at
last
