an

to

curious
in
contrasts
surely
one
of
the
chief
pleasures
of
travel
there
can
be
no
better
preparation
for
a
descent
into
italy
than
a
sojourn
among
the
upper
swiss
valleys
to
pass
from
the
region
of
the
obviously
picturesque
the
country
contrived
it
would
seem
for
the
delectation
of
the
à
poésie
to
that
sophisticated
landscape
where
the
face
of
nature
seems
moulded
by
the
passions
and
imaginings
of
man
is
one
of
the
most
suggestive
transitions
in
the
rapidly
diminishing
range
of
such
experiences
nowhere
is
this
contrast
more
acutely
felt
than
in
one
of
the
upper
grisons
villages
the
anecdotic
switzerland
of
the
lakes
is
too
remote
from
italy
geographically
and
morally
to
evoke
a
comparison
the
toy
chalet
with
its
air
of
neatness
making
one
feel
that
if
one
lifted
the
roof
it
would
disclose
a
row
of
tapes
and
scissors
or
the
shining
cylinders
of
a
musical
box
suggests
rather
than
architecture
the
swept
and
garnished
streets
the
precise
gardens
the
subjugated
vines
present
the
image
of
an
old
maid
s
paradise
that
would
be
thrown
into
hopeless
disarray
by
the
introduction
of
anything
so
irregular
as
a
work
of
art
in
the
grisons
however
where
only
a
bald
grey
pass
divides
one
from
italy
its
influence
is
felt
in
a
negative
sense
in
the
very
untidiness
of
the
streets
the
rank
growth
of
weeds
along
the
base
of
rough
glaring
walls
the
drone
of
flies
about
more
agreeably
the
same
influence
shows
itself
in
the
rude
old
houses
with
their
and
stone
escutcheons
surmounting
the
odorous
darkness
of
a
stable
these
are
the
houses
of
people
conscious
of
italy
who
have
transplanted
to
their
bleak
heights
either
from
poverty
of
invention
or
an
impulse
as
sentimental
as
our
modern
habit
of
collecting
the
thick
walls
the
small
windows
the
jutting
eaves
of
dwellings
designed
under
a
sultry
sky
so
vivid
is
the
reminiscence
that
one
almost
expects
to
see
a
cypress
leaning
against
the
walls
of
the
village
but
it
is
just
here
that
the
contrast
accentuates
itself
the
cypress
with
all
it
stands
for
is
missing
it
is
not
easy
in
the
height
of
the
swiss
season
to
light
on
a
nook
neglected
by
the
tourist
but
at
splügen
he
still
sweeps
by
in
a
cloud
of
diligence
dust
or
pauses
only
to
gulp
a
flask
of
paradiso
and
a
rosy
trout
from
the
suretta
lakes
one
s
enjoyment
of
the
place
is
thus
enhanced
by
the
pleasing
spectacle
of
the
misguided
hundreds
who
pass
it
by
and
from
the
vantage
of
the
solitary
meadows
above
the
village
one
may
watch
the
throngs
descending
on
thusis
or
chiavenna
with
something
of
the
satisfaction
that
mediæval
schoolmen
believed
to
be
the
portion
of
angels
looking
down
upon
the
damned
splügen
abounds
in
such
points
of
observation
on
all
sides
one
may
climb
from
the
shores
of
the
rhine
through
tremulous
with
the
leap
of
water
to
grassy
levels
far
above
whence
the
valley
is
seen
lengthening
southward
to
a
great
concourse
of
peaks
in
the
morning
these
upper
meadows
are
hot
and
bright
and
one
is
glad
of
the
pines
and
the
torrents
cooling
the
dusk
but
toward
sunset
when
the
shadows
make
the
slopes
of
turf
look
like
an
expanse
of
tumbled
velvet
it
is
pleasant
to
pace
the
open
ledges
watching
the
sun
recede
from
the
valley
where
mowers
are
still
sweeping
the
grass
into
long
curved
lines
like
ridges
of
the
sea
while
the
on
the
eastern
slopes
grow
black
and
the
upper
snows
fade
to
the
colour
of
cold
ashes
the
landscape
is
simple
spacious
and
serene
the
fields
suggest
the
tranquil
rumination
of
generations
of
cattle
the
woods
offer
cool
security
to
sylvan
life
the
mountains
present
blunt
surfaces
rather
than
the
subtle
contours
wrinkled
as
by
meditation
of
the
italian
alps
one
feels
that
it
is
a
scene
in
which
has
ever
the
haunting
adjective
is
that
which
whitman
applies
to
the
american
landscape
the
large
scenery
of
my
native
switzerland
is
like
a
dinner
served
in
the
way
with
all
the
dishes
put
on
the
table
at
once
every
valley
has
its
flowery
mead
its
horrid
gorge
its
peaks
its
wood
and
in
italy
the
effects
are
brought
on
in
courses
and
memory
is
thus
able
to
differentiate
the
landscapes
even
without
the
help
of
that
touch
of
human
individuality
to
which
after
all
the
best
italian
scenery
is
but
a
setting
at
splügen
as
in
most
swiss
landscapes
the
human
interest
the
evidences
of
man
s
presence
are
an
interruption
rather
than
a
climax
the
village
of
splügen
huddled
on
a
ledge
above
the
rhine
sheepishly
turns
the
backs
of
its
houses
on
the
view
as
though
conscious
of
making
a
poor
show
compared
to
the
tremendous
performance
of
nature
between
these
houses
set
at
unconsidered
angles
like
boxes
hastily
piled
on
a
shelf
streets
ramble
up
the
hill
but
after
a
few
yards
they
lapse
into
mountain
paths
and
the
pastures
stoop
unabashed
to
the
back
doors
of
the
village
agriculture
seems
in
fact
the
little
town
s
excuse
for
being
the
whole
of
splügen
in
midsummer
is
as
one
arm
at
the
end
of
a
scythe
all
day
long
the
lines
of
stooping
figures
men
women
and
children
grandfathers
and
industrious
babes
spread
themselves
over
the
in
an
radius
interminably
cutting
raking
and
stacking
the
grass
the
lower
slopes
are
first
laid
bare
then
to
the
sheer
upper
zone
of
pines
the
long
grass
thick
with
larkspur
mountain
pink
and
orchis
gradually
recedes
before
the
rising
tide
of
mowers
even
in
the
graveyard
of
the
church
the
scythes
swing
between
mounds
overgrown
with
campanulas
and
martagon
lilies
so
that
one
may
fancy
the
dust
of
generations
of
thrifty
villagers
enriching
the
harvests
of
posterity
this
indeed
is
the
only
destiny
one
can
imagine
for
them
the
past
of
such
a
place
must
have
been
as
bucolic
as
its
present
the
mediæval
keep
crumbling
on
its
wooded
spur
above
the
rhine
was
surely
perched
there
that
the
lords
of
the
valley
might
have
an
eye
to
the
grazing
cattle
and
command
the
manœuvres
of
the
mowers
the
noble
georgiis
who
lived
in
the
escutcheoned
houses
of
splügen
and
now
lie
under
such
a
wealth
of
quarterings
in
the
church
and
graveyard
must
have
been
experts
in
fertilizers
and
nor
can
one
figure
even
for
the
mercenary
of
the
name
whose
epitaph
declares
him
to
have
been
captain
of
his
spanish
majesty
s
cohorts
emotions
more
poignant
when
he
came
home
from
the
wars
than
that
evoked
by
the
tinkle
of
in
the
pasture
and
the
vision
of
a
table
groaning
with
smoked
beef
and
cyclopean
cheeses
so
completely
are
the
peasants
in
the
fields
a
part
of
the
soil
they
cultivate
that
during
the
day
one
may
be
said
to
have
the
whole
of
splügen
to
one
s
self
from
the
topmost
peaks
to
the
deserted
in
the
evening
the
scene
changes
and
the
transformation
is
not
unintentionally
described
in
theatrical
terms
since
the
square
which
after
sunset
becomes
the
centre
of
life
in
splügen
has
an
absurd
resemblance
to
a
one
side
of
this
square
is
bounded
by
the
long
front
of
the
but
the
inn
deserves
a
parenthesis
built
long
ago
and
then
abandoned
so
the
village
tradition
runs
by
a
great
italian
family
its
exterior
shows
the
thick
walls
projecting
eaves
and
oval
attic
openings
of
an
old
tuscan
house
while
within
a
monastic
ramification
of
corridors
leads
to
rooms
ceiled
and
panelled
with
woodwork
the
stone
terrace
before
this
impressive
dwelling
forms
the
proscenium
where
after
dinner
the
spectators
assemble
to
the
right
of
the
square
stands
the
pale
pink
post
and
telegraph
beyond
closing
in
the
right
wing
at
a

a
mysterious
yellowish
house
with
an
arched
entrance
facing
these
on
the
left
are
the
of
the
inn
and
the
in
the
left
background
the
village
street
is
seen
winding
down
between
houses
that
look
like
studies
in
with
the
cracks
in
the
plaster
done
in
very
black
lead
to
the
bridge
across
the
rhine
and
the
first
loops
of
the
over
the
splügen
pass
opposite
the
inn
is
the
obligatory
village
fountain
the
of
the
chorus
beneath
a
stone
parapet
flows
the
torrent
which
acts
as
an
invisible
orchestra
and
beyond
the
parapet
snow
peaks
fill
the
background
of
the
stage
dinner
over
the
eager
spectators
hastening
to
the
terrace
with
a
glimpse
as
they
pass
the
vaulted
kitchen
of
the
italian
oiling
his
bicycle
amid
the
débris
of
an
admirable
meal
find
active
preparations
afoot
for
the
event
of
the
evening
the
arrival
of
the
diligences
already
the
orchestra
is
tuning
its
instruments
and
the
chorus
recruited
from
the
are
gathering
in
the
wings
a
dozen
of
them
straggle
in
and
squat
on
the
jutting
stone
basement
of
the
others
hang
picturesquely
about
the
fountain
or
hover
up
the
steep
street
awaiting
the
prompter
s
call
presently
some
of
the
subordinate
characters
stroll
across
the
stage
the
owner
of
the
on
the
rhine
a
tall
man
in
homespun
deferentially
saluted
by
the
chorus
two
personages
in
black
coats
with
who
always
appear
together
and
have
the
air
of
being
joint
syndics
of
the
village
a
gentleman
of
leisure
in
a
white
cap
with
a
visor
smoking
a
long
italian
cigar
and
attended
by
an
inquisitive
pomeranian
dog
a
citizen
in
white
socks
and
carpet
slippers
giving
his
arm
to
his
wife
and
preceded
by
a
bewickian
little
boy
with
a
green
over
his
shoulder
the
officer
hurrying
up
rather
late
for
his
cue
two
or
three
local
ladies
in
sunburnt
millinery
and
spectacles
who
drop
in
to
see
the
postmistress
and
a
showy
young
man
with
the
look
of
having
seen
life
at
chur
or
bellinzona
who
emerges
from
the
conspicuously
reading
a
letter
to
the
undisguised
interest
of
the
chorus
the
ladies
and
the
pomeranian
as
these
figures
pass
and
repass
in
a
kind
of
social
silence
they
suggest
the
leisurely
opening
of
some
play
composed
before
the
unities
were
abolished
and
peopled
by
types
with
generic
names
the
innkeeper
the
postmistress
the
syndic
some
comedy
of
goldoni
s
perhaps
but
void
even
of
goldoni
s
simple
malice
meanwhile
the
porter
has
lit
the
hanging
by
a
chain
over
the
door
of
the
inn
a
celestial
hand
has
performed
a
similar
office
for
the
evening
star
above
the
peaks
and
through
the
hush
that
has
settled
on
the
square
comes
a
distant
sound
of
bells
instantly
the
action
begins
the
innkeeper
appears
supported
by
the
porter
and
the
waiter
a
wave
of
acclamation
runs
through
the
chorus
the
pomeranian
trots
down
the
road
and
presently
the
fagged
leaders
of
the
thusis
diligence
turn
their
heads
round
the
corner
of
the
square
the
preposterous
yellow
coach
a
landau
attached
to
a
glass
clarence
crosses
the
stage
swinging
round
with
a
grand
curve
to
the
inn
door
vague
figures
detaching
themselves
from
the
chorus
flit
about
the
horses
or
help
the
guard
to
lift
the
luggage
down
the
two
syndics
critically
aloof
lean
on
their
sticks
to
watch
the
scene
the
pomeranian
bustles
between
the
tired
horses
legs
and
the
diligence
doors
let
out
a
menagerie
of
the
strange
folk
whom
one
sees
only
on
one
s
travels
here
they
come
familiar
as
the
figures
in
a
noah
s
ark
germans
first
the
little
man
with
a
dachshund
out
of
fliegende
blätter
the
slippered
hercules
with
a
face
like
that
at
the
end
of
a
meerschaum
pipe
and
their
sentimental
females
shrill
and
vivid
italians
a
pleasant
priest
americans
going
right
through
with
their
city
and
state
writ
large
upon
their
luggage
english
girls
like
navvies
and
frenchmen
like
girls
the
arched
doorway
absorbs
them
and
another
jingle
of
bells
and
a
flash
of
lamps
on
the
bridge
proclaim
that
the
chiavenna
diligence
is
coming
the
same
ceremony
repeats
itself
and
another
detachment
of
the
travelling
menagerie
descends
this
time
there
is
a
family
of
rodents
who
look
as
though
they
ought
to
be
enclosed
in
wire
netting
and
judiciously
nourished
on
lettuce
there
is
a
small
fierce
man
in
knickerbockers
and
a
sash
conducting
a
large
submissive
wife
and
two
hypocritical
little
boys
who
might
have
stepped
out
of
the
mirror
of
the
mind
there
is
an
unfortunate
lady
in
spectacles
who
looks
like
one
of
the
creator
s
rejected
experiments
and
carries
a
grey
linen
bag
embroidered
with
there
is
the
inevitable
youth
with
an
alpenstock
who
sends
home
a
bunch
of
edelweiss
to
his
family
these
too
disappear
the
horses
are
led
away
the
chorus
disperses
the
lights
go
out
the
performance
is
over
only
one
spectator
lingers
a
thoughtful
man
in
a
overcoat
who
gives
the
measure
of
the
social
resources
of
splügen
by
the
deliberate
way
in
which
evening
after
evening
he
walks
around
the
empty
diligences
looks
into
their
windows
examines
the
wheels
and
poles
and
then
mournfully
vanishes
into
darkness
at
last
the
two
diligences
have
the
silent
square
to
themselves
there
they
stand
side
by
side
in
dusty
slumber
till
the
morning
wake
them
to
departure
one
goes
back
to
thusis
to
the
region
of
good
hotels
pure
air
and
scenic
platitudes
it
may
go
empty
for
all
we
care
but
the
other
the
other
wakes
from
its
alpine
sleep
to
climb
the
cold
pass
at
sunrise
and
descend
by
hot
windings
into
the
land
where
the
church
steeples
turn
into
where
the
vine
breaking
from
perpendicular
bondage
flings
a
liberated
embrace
about
the
mulberries
and
far
off
beyond
the
plain
the
mirage
of
domes
and
spires
of
painted
walls
and
sculptured
altars
beckons
across
the
dustiest
tracts
of
memory

that

for
ten
days
we
had
not
known
what
ailed
us
we
had
fled
from
the
august
heat
and
crowd
of
the
vorderrheinthal
to
the
below
the
splügen
pass
and
here
fortune
had
given
us
all
the
midsummer
tourist
can
hope
for
solitude
cool
air
and
fine
scenery
a
dozen
times
a
day
we
counted
our
mercies
but
still
privately
felt
them
to
be
insufficient
as
we
walked
through
the
beside
the
rhine
or
climbed
the
grassy
heights
above
the
valley
we
were
oppressed
by
the
didactic
quality
of
our
surroundings
by
the
aggressive
salubrity
and
repose
of
this
de
we
seemed
to
be
living
in
the
landscape
of
a
sanatorium

it
was
all
pleasant
enough
according
to
schopenhauer

definition
of
pleasure
we
had
none
of
the
things
we
did
not
want
but
then
we
did
not
particularly
want
any
of
the
things
we
had
we
had
fancied
we
did
till
we
got
them
and
as
we
had
to
own
that
they
did
their
part
in
fulfilling
our
anticipations
we
were
driven
to
conclude
that
the
fault
was
in
ourselves
then
suddenly
we
found
out
what
was
wrong

was
charming
but
it
was
too
near
italy
one
can
forgive
a
place
three
thousand
miles
from
italy
for
not
being
italian
but
that
a
village
on
the
very
border
should
remain
stolidly
immovably
swiss
was
a
constant
source
of
exasperation
even
the
landscape
had
neglected
its
opportunities
a
few
miles
off
it
became
the
accomplice
of
man
s
most
exquisite
imaginings
but
here
we
could
see
in
it
only
endless
material
for
swiss
clocks
and
fodder
the
trouble
began
with
our
watching
the
diligences
every
evening
we
saw
one
toiling
up
the
pass
from
chiavenna
with
dusty
horses
and
perspiring
passengers
how
we
pitied
those
passengers
we
walked
among
them
puffed
up
with
all
the
good
air
in
our
lungs
we
felt
fresh
and
cool
and
enviable
and
moralized
on
the
plaintive
lot
of
those
whose
scant
holidays
compelled
them
to
visit
italy
in
august
but
already
the
poison
was
at
work
we
pictured
what
our
less
fortunate
brothers
had
seen
till
we
began
to
wonder
if
after
all
they
were
less
fortunate
at
least
they
had
and
what
drawbacks
could
qualify
that
fact
was
it
better
to
be
cool
and
look
at
a
or
to
be
hot
and
look
at
saint
mark
s
was
it
better
to
walk
on
gentians
or
on
mosaic
to
smell
or
incense
was
it
in
short
ever
well
to
be
elsewhere
when
one
might
be
in
italy
we
tried
to
quell
the
rising
madness
by
interrogating
the
travellers
was
it
very
hot
on
the
lakes
and
in
milan
terribly
they
answered
and
mopped
their
brows
unimaginative
idiots
we
grumbled
and
forbore
to
question
the
next
batch
of
course
it
was
hot
there
but
what
of
that
think
of
the
compensations
to
take
it
on
the
lowest
plane
think
of
the
empty
hotels
and
railway
carriages
the
absence
of
tourists
and
baedekers
even
the
italians
were
away
among
the
apennines
and
in
the
engadine
we
should
have
the
best
part
of
the
country
to
ourselves
gradually
we
began
to
picture
our
sensations
should
we
take
seats
in
the
diligence
on
its
return
journey
from
that
moment
we
were
lost
we
did
not
say
much
to
each
other
but
one
morning
at
sunrise
we
found
a
at
the
door
no
one
seemed
to
know
who
had
ordered
it
but
we
noticed
that
our
luggage
was
being
strapped
on
behind
we
took
our
seats
and
the
driver
turned
his
horses
toward
the
splügen
pass
it
was
not
the
way
to
switzerland
illustration
the
port
of
peixotto
loveire
we
mounted
to
ice
and
snow
the
savage
landscape
led
us
to
the
top
of
the
pass
and
dogged
us
down
to
the
miserable
italian
on
the
other
side
then
began
the
long
descent
through
and
steep
above
the
lonely
gorge
of
the
madesimo
switzerland
still
in
every
aspect
but
with
a
promise
of
italy
in
the
names
of
the
dreary
villages
visible
italy
began
with
the
valley
of
the
lira
where
in
a
wild
salvator
rosa
landscape
the
beautiful
campanile
of
the
madonna
of
gallevaggio
rises
above
embowering
walnuts
after
that
each
successive
village
declared
its
allegiance
more
openly
the
huddled
stone
houses
disappeared
in
a
wealth
of
pomegranates
and
oleanders
shaded
the
doorways
roses
and
dahlias
overflowed
the
terraces
of
rough
masonry
and
between
the
there
were
and
fields
of
maize
as
we
approached
chiavenna
a
thick
bloom
of
heat
lay
on
the
motionless
foliage
and
the
mountains
hung
like
on
the
horizon
there
was
something
oppressive
menacing
almost
in
the
still
weight
of
the
atmosphere
it
seemed
to
have
absorbed
all
the
ardour
of
the
lombard
plain
of
the
shadeless
rice
and
maize
fields
stretching
away
to
the
south
of
us
but
the
eye
had
ample
compensation
the
familiar
town
of
chiavenna
had
grown
as
fantastically
picturesque
as
the
background
of
a
fresco
the
old
houses
with
their
medallioned
doorways
of
worn
marble
the
bright
with
flowers
and
shaded
by
trellised
vines
the
white
turbulence
of
the
lira
rushing
between
gardens
balconies
and
terraces
set
at
reckless
angles
above
the
water
were
all
these
a
part
of
the
town
we
had
so
often
seen
at
less
romantic
seasons
the
general
impression
was
of
an
exuberance
of
rococo
as
though
the
sportive
statue
of
saint
john
nepomuc
on
the
bridge
the
grotesque
figures
on
the
balustrade
of
the
villa
near
the
hotel
and
the
stucco
shrines
at
the
street
corners
had
burst
into
a
plastic
efflorescence
rivalling
the
midsummer
wealth
of
the
gardens
we
had
left
switzerland
with
the
general
object
of
going
to
italy
and
the
specific
one
of
exploring
the
bergamasque
alps
it
was
the
name
which
had
attracted
us
as
much
from
its
intrinsic
picturesqueness
as
from
its
associations
with
the
dell
and
the
jolly
figures
of
harlequin
and
brighella
i
have
often
journeyed
thus
in
pursuit
of
a
name
and
have
seldom
been
unrewarded
in
this
case
the
very
aspect
of
the
map
was
promising
the
region
included
in
the
scattered
lettering
had
that
furrowed
serried
look
so
encouraging
to
the
experienced
traveller
it
was
rich
crowded
suggestive
and
the
names
of
the
villages
were
enchanting
early
the
next
morning
we
set
out
for
colico
at
the
head
of
the
lake
of
como
and
thence
took
train
for
sondrio
the
chief
town
of
the
valtelline
the
lake
where
we
had
to
wait
for
our
train
lay
in
unnatural
loveliness
beneath
a
breathless
sky
the
furrowed
peaks
bathed
in
subtle
of
which
at
other
seasons
the
atmosphere
gives
no
hint
at
sondrio
we
found
all
the
dreariness
of
a
modern
italian
town
with
wide
unshaded
streets
but
taking
carriage
in
the
afternoon
for
madonna
di
tirano
we
were
soon
in
the
land
of
romance
again
the
valtelline
through
which
we
drove
is
one
vast
fruit
and
vegetable
garden
of
extraordinary
fertility
the
as
the
maize
is
called
grows
in
jungles
taller
than
a
man
and
the
grapes
and
melons
have
the
exaggerated
size
and
bloom
of
their
counterfeits
in
a
dutch
the
rich
dulness
of
this
foreground
was
relieved
by
the
noble
lines
of
the
hills
and
the
air
cooled
by
the
rush
of
the
adda
which
followed
the
windings
of
our
road
and
by
a
glimpse
of
snow
peaks
at
the
head
of
the
valley
the
villages
were
uninteresting
but
we
passed
a
deserted
church
a
charming
bit
of
decay
with
peeling
stucco
ornaments
and
weeds
growing
from
the
florid
vases
of
the
pediment
and
far
off
on
a
lonely
wooded
height
there
was
a
tantalizing
glimpse
of
another
church
a
renaissance
building
rich
with
encrusted
marbles
one
of
the
nameless
uncatalogued
treasures
in
which
italy
still
abounds
toward
sunset
we
reached
madonna
di
tirano
the
great
pilgrimage
church
of
the
valtelline
with
its
adjoining
monastery
it
stands
alone
in
meadows
a
mile
or
more
from
the
town
of
tirano
the
marble
church
a
late
building
by
battagio
the
architect
of
the
incoronata
of
lodi
has
the
peculiar
charm
of
that
transitional
period
when
individuality
of
detail
was
merged
but
not
yet
lost
in
the
sense
of
unity
from
the
columns
of
the
porch
with
their
arabesques
to
the
bronze
saint
michael
poised
like
a
mercury
on
the
cupola
the
whole
building
combines
the
charm
and
naïveté
of
the
earlier
tradition
with
the
dignity
of
a
studied
whole
the
interior
if
less
homogeneous
is
in
the
french
sense
even
more
owing
doubtless
to
the
remote
situation
of
the
church
it
has
escaped
the
unifying
hand
of
the
improver
and
presents
three
centuries
of
conflicting
decorative
treatment
ranging
from
the
marble
chapel
of
the
madonna
so
suggestive
in
its
reliefs
of
the
work
of
omodeo
at
pavia
to
the
barocco
carvings
of
the
organ
and
the
beneath
the
the
neighbouring
monastery
of
saint
michael
has
been
turned
into
an
inn
without
farther
change
than
that
of
substituting
tourists
for
monks
in
the
cells
around
the
cloisters
the
old
building
is
a
dusty
labyrinth
of
loggias
and
upper
galleries
which
it
needs
but
little
imagination
to
people
with
cowled
figures
gliding
to
lauds
or
benediction
and
the
refectory
where
we
supped
is
still
hung
with
portraits
of
cardinals
monsignori
and
lady
abbesses
holding
little
dogs
the
next
day
we
drove
across
the
rich
meadows
to
tirano
one
of
those
unhistoried
and
unconsidered
italian
towns
which
hold
in
reserve
for
the
observant
eye
a
treasure
of
quiet
impressions
it
is
difficult
to
name
any
special
effect
the
hurried
may
discover
only
dull
streets
and
featureless
but
the
place
has
a
fine
quality
of
age
and
aloofness
the
featureless
houses
are
palaces
and
escutcheoned
with
glimpses
of
arcaded
courts
and
of
gardens
where
maize
and
dahlias
smother
the
broken
statues
and
choked
fountains
and
where
grapes
ripen
on
the
peeling
stucco
walls
here
and
there
one
comes
on
a
frivolous
rococo
church
subdued
by
time
to
delicious
harmony
with
its
surroundings
on
a
fountain
in
a
quiet
square
or
a
balcony
projecting
romantically
from
a
shuttered
façade
or
on
one
or
another
of
the
hundred
characteristic
details
which
go
to
make
up
the
en
of
the
average
italian
town
it
is
precisely
in
places
like
tirano
where
there
are
no
salient
beauties
to
fix
the
eye
that
one
appreciates
the
value
of
these
details
that
one
realizes
what
may
be
called
the
negative
strength
of
the
italian
artistic
sense
where
the
italian
builder
could
not
be
grand
he
could
always
abstain
from
being
mean
and
trivial
and
this
artistic
abnegation
gives
to
many
a
dull
little
town
like
tirano
an
architectural
dignity
which
our
great
cities
lack
ii
the
return
to
secular
life
was
made
two
days
later
when
we
left
our
monastery
and
set
out
to
drive
across
the
aprica
pass
to
edolo
retracing
for
a
mile
or
two
the
way
toward
sondrio
we
took
a
turn
to
the
left
and
began
to
mount
the
hills
through
forests
of
beech
and
chestnut
with
each
bend
of
the
road
the
views
down
the
valtelline
toward
sondrio
and
como
grew
wider
and
more
beautiful
no
one
who
has
not
looked
out
on
such
a
prospect
in
the
early
light
of
an
august
morning
can
appreciate
the
poetic
truth
of
claude
s
interpretation
of
nature
we
seemed
to
be
moving
through
a
gallery
hung
with
his
pictures
there
was
the
same
expanse
of
billowy
forest
the
same
silver
winding
of
a
river
through
infinite
gradations
of
distance
the
same
aërial
line
of
hills
melting
into
illimitable
sky
as
we
neared
the
top
of
the
pass
the
air
freshened
and
pines
and
open
meadows
replaced
the
forest
we
lunched
at
a
little
hotel
in
a
bare
meadow
among
a
crowd
of
italians
enjoying
the
in
their
shrill
gregarious
fashion
then
we
began
the
descent
to
edolo
in
the
val
camonica
the
scenery
changed
rapidly
as
we
drove
on
there
was
no
longer
any
great
extent
of
landscape
as
on
the
other
side
of
the
pass
but
a
succession
of
small
views
rounded
clumps
of
trees
interspersed
with
mossy
glades
surmounted
by
old
mills
rising
above
villages
hidden
in
foliage
on
these
smooth
grassy
terraces
under
the
walnut
boughs
one
expected
at
each
turn
to
come
upon
some
pastoral
of
giorgione
s
or
on
one
of
bonifazio
s
sumptuous
picnics
the
scenery
has
a
studied
beauty
in
which
velvet
robes
and
caparisoned
palfreys
would
not
be
out
of
place
and
even
the
villages
might
have
been
brushed
in
by
an
artist
skilled
in
effects
and
not
afraid
to
improve
upon
reality
it
was
after
sunset
when
we
reached
edolo
a
dull
town
splendidly
placed
at
the
head
of
the
val
camonica
beneath
the
of
the
adamello
the
oglio
a
loud
stream
voluble
of
the
glaciers
rushes
through
the
drowsy
streets
as
though
impatient
to
be
gone
and
we
were
not
sorry
the
next
morning
to
follow
its
lead
and
continue
our
way
down
the
valley
iii
the
val
camonica
which
extends
from
the
adamello
group
to
the
head
of
the
lake
of
iseo
is
a
smaller
and
more
picturesque
reproduction
of
the
valtelline
vines
and
maize
again
fringed
our
way
but
the
mountains
were
closer
the
villages
more
frequent
and
more
picturesque
illustration
municipio
peixotto
brescia
we
had
read
in
the
invaluable
of
a
vague
allusion
to
an
interesting
church
among
these
mountains
but
we
could
learn
nothing
of
it
at
edolo
and
only
by
persistent
enquiries
along
the
road
did
we
finally
hear
that
there
a
church
with
sculptures
in
the
of
cerveno
high
above
the
reach
of
carriages
we
left
the
at
the
point
indicated
and
drove
in
a
light
country
carriole
up
the
stony
between
vines
and
orchards
till
the
track
grew
too
rough
for
wheels
then
we
continued
the
ascent
on
foot
as
we
approached
the
cluster
of
miserable
hovels
which
had
been
pointed
out
to
us
we
felt
sure
we
had
been
misled
not
even
in
italy
the
land
of
unsuspected
treasures
could
one
hope
to
find
a
church
with
sculptures
in
a
village
on
this
remote
mountain
cerveno
does
not
even
show
any
signs
of
past
prosperity
it
has
plainly
never
been
more
than
it
now
is
the
humblest
of
huddled
away
in
an
unvisited
fold
of
the
alps
the
peasants
whom
we
met
still
insisted
that
the
church
we
sought
was
close
at
hand
but
the
higher
we
mounted
the
lower
our
anticipations
fell
then
suddenly
at
the
end
of
a
long
stony
lane
we
came
on
an
imposing
doorway
the
church
to
which
it
belonged
stood
on
a
higher
ledge
of
the
hill
and
the
door
led
into
a
vaulted
ascent
with
shallow
flights
of
steps
broken
by
platforms
or
landings
a
small
but
yet
impressive
imitation
of
the
bernini
staircase
in
the
vatican
as
we
mounted
we
found
that
each
landing
opened
into
a
chapel
with
grated
doors
through
which
we
discerned
groups
representing
the
scenes
of
the
passion
the
staircase
was
in
fact
a
sacred
way
like
the
more
famous
one
of
varallo
but
there
was
distinct
originality
in
placing
the
chapels
on
each
side
of
the
long
flight
of
steps
leading
to
the
church
instead
of
scattering
them
on
an
open
according
to
the
traditional
plan
common
to
all
the
other
sacred
mountains
of
northern
italy
the
dilettante
will
always
allow
for
the
heightening
of
emotion
that
attends
any
unexpected
artistic
find
but
setting
this
subjective
impression
aside
the
via
crucis
of
cerveno
remains
in
my
memory
as
among
the
best
examples
of
its
kind
excepting
always
the
remarkable
of
san
vivaldo
in
tuscany
at
cerveno
as
at
varallo
the
groups
are
marked
by
unusual
vivacity
and
expressiveness
the
main
lines
of
the
composition
are
conventional
and
the
chief
personages
christ
and
the
apostles
the
virgin
and
the
other
holy
characters
are
modelled
on
traditional
types
but
the
minor
figures
evidently
taken
from
life
are
rendered
with
frank
realism
and
with
extraordinary
truth
of
expression
and
gesture
just
such
types
the
dwarf
the
beggar
the
hunchback
the
brawny
waggoner
or
ploughman
had
met
us
in
every
village
on
the
way
to
cerveno
as
in
all
the
where
the
goitre
is
prevalent
the
most
villanous
characters
in
the
drama
are
depicted
with
a
hideous
bag
of
flesh
beneath
the
chin
and
signorelli
could
not
have
conceived
more
bestial
leering
cruelty
than
that
in
some
of
the
faces
which
press
about
the
dying
christ
the
scenes
follow
the
usual
order
of
the
sacred
story
without
marked
departure
from
the
conventional
grouping
but
there
is
unusual
pathos
in
the
descent
from
the
cross
where
the
light
from
the
roof
of
the
chapel
falls
with
tragic
intensity
on
the
face
of
a
magdalen
full
of
suave
lombard
beauty
hardly
less
surprising
than
this
remarkable
stairway
is
the
church
to
which
it
leads
the
walls
are
hung
with
devotional
pictures
set
in
the
faded
gilding
of
rich
old
frames
the
are
remarkable
examples
of
and
the
high
altar
is
surmounted
by
an
elaborate
tabernacle

the
sculptor
of

of

in
the
church
of

was
one
of
the
greatest
of
the
italian
renaissance
and
every
church
and
chapel
in
the
country
through
which
we
were
travelling
bore
witness
to
the
continued
practice
of
the
art
in
some
graceful
frame
or
some

or

rudely
but
expressively
modelled
we
lunched
that
day
at

a
town
guarded
by
a
ruined
castle
on
a
hill
and
sunset
brought
us
to
lovere
at
the
head
of
the
lake
of
iseo
it
was
the
stillest
of
still
evenings
and
the
little
town
which
lady
mary
wortley

has
immortalized
was
reflected
with
every
seam
and
wrinkle
of
its
mountain
background
in
the
pearly
surface
of
the
lake
critics
seeking
in
vain
along
the
shore
for
lady
mary
s
villa
and
garden
have
grumbled
at
the
inaccuracy
of
her
descriptions
but
every
lover
of
italy
will
understand
the
mental
process
by
which
she
unconsciously
created
an
imaginary
lovere
for
though
the
town
at
first
sight
is
dull
and
disappointing
yet
taken
with
its
surroundings
it
might
well
form
the
substructure
of
one
of
those
turneresque
visions
which
in
italy
are
perpetually
intruding
between
the
most
conscientious
traveller
and
his
actual
surroundings
it
is
indeed
almost
impossible
to
see
italy
steadily
and
see
it
whole
the
onset
of
impressions
and
memories
is
at
times
so
overwhelming
that
observation
is
lost
in
mere
sensation
certainly
he
who
on
an
august
morning
sails
from
lovere
to
iseo
at
the
southern
end
of
the
lake
is
likely
to
find
himself
succumbing
to
lady
mary
s
hallucinations
warned
by
her
example
and
conscious
of
lacking
her
extenuating
gift
i
hesitate
to
record
my
impressions
of
the
scene
or
venture
at
most
to
do
so
in
the
past
tense
asserting
and
this
even
with
a
mental
reservation
that
on
a
certain
morning
a
certain
number
of
years
ago
the
lake
of
iseo
wore
such
and
such
an
aspect
but
the
difficulty
of
rendering
the
aspect
remains
i
can
only
say
it
was
that
very
lake
of
the
du
upon
which
in
the
romances
gay
parties
in
barges
used
to
set
out
for
the
island
of
cythera
every
village
on
that
enchanted
shore
might
have
been
the
stage
of
some
comedy
in
the
bergamasque
dialect
with
harlequin
in
striped
cloak
and
brighella
in
conical
hat
and
wide
green
and
white
trousers
strutting
up
and
down
before
the
shuttered
house
in
which
graziano
hides
his
pretty
ward
every
villa
reflecting
its
awnings
and
bright
flowers
in
the
lake
might
have
housed
some
rosaura
to
whom
leandro
the
tuscan
lover
warbled
beneath
the
padlocked

pink
or
yellow

the

in

and

socks
the
eighteenth
century
of
longhi
of
tiepolo
and
goldoni
was
reflected
in
the
lake
as
in
some
magic
crystal
did
the
vision
dissolve
as
we
landed
at
iseo
or
will
some
later
traveller
find
it
still
lying
beneath
the
wave
like
the
vanished
city
of
ys
there
is
no
telling
in
such
cases
how
much
the
eye
receives
and
how
much
it
contributes
and
if
ever
the
boundaries
between
fact
and
fancy
waver
it
may
well
be
under
the
spell
of
the
italian
midsummer
madness
iv
the
sun
lay
heavy
on
iseo
and
the
railway
journey
thence
to
brescia
left
in
our
brains
a
golden
dazzle
of
heat
it
was
refreshing
on
reaching
brescia
to
enter
the
streets
of
the
old
town
where
the
roofs
almost
meet
and
there
is
always
a
blessed
strip
of
shade
to
walk
in
the
cities
in
italy
are
much
cooler
than
the
country
it
is
in
august
that
one
understands
the
wisdom
of
the
old
builders
who
made
the
streets
so
narrow
and
built
dim
draughty
arcades
around
the
open
squares
in
brescia
the
effects
of
light
and
shade
thus
produced
were
almost
oriental
in
their
intensity
the
rough
stucco
surfaces
gilded
with
vivid
sunlight
bringing
out
the
depths
of
contrasting
shade
and
the
women
with
black
veils
over
their
heads
slipping
along
under
the
mysterious
balconies
and
porticoes
like
flitting
fragments
of
the
shadow
illustration
dei
miracoli
brescia
is
at
all
times
a
delightful
place
to
linger
in
its
chief
possessions
the
bronze
victory
and
that
room
in
the
martinengo
palace
where
moretto
in
his
happiest
mood
depicted
the
ladies
of
the
line
under
arches
of
backed
by
views
of
the
family
villas
make
it
noteworthy
even
among
italian
cities
and
it
has
besides
its
beautiful
its
and
the
curious
painted
in
perspective
that
are
so
characteristic
of
the
place
but
in
summer
there
is
a
strong
temptation
to
sit
and
think
of
these
things
rather
than
to
go
and
see
them
in
the
of
the
hotel
where
a
fountain
tinkles
refreshingly
and
the
unbleached
awnings
flap
in
the
breeze
of
the
electric
fans
it
is
pleasant
to
feel
that
the
victory
and
the
pictures
are
close
at
hand
like
old
friends
waiting
on
one
s
inclination
but
if
one
ventures
forth
let
it
be
rather
to
the
churches
than
to
the
galleries
only
at
this
season
can
one
appreciate
the
atmosphere
of
the
churches
that
chill
which
cuts
the
sunshine
like
a
knife
as
one
steps
across
the
dusky
threshold
when
we
entered
the
cathedral
its
vast
aisles
were
empty
but
far
off
in
the
dimness
of
the
pillared
choir
we
heard
a
drone
of
intoning
canons
that
freshened
the
air
like
the
sound
of
a
in
a
forest
thence
we
wandered
on
to
san
francesco
empty
too
where
in
the
dimness
the
great
romanino
throned
behind
the
high
altar
the
sacristan
drew
back
the
curtain
before
the
picture
and
as
it
was
revealed
to
us
in
all
its
glory
he
exclaimed
with
sudden
wonder
as
though
he
had
never
seen
it
before
stupendo
è
stupendo
perhaps
he
vaguely
felt
as
we
did
that
romanino
to
be
appreciated
must
be
seen
in
just
that
light
a
projection
of
the
suave
and
radiant
atmosphere
in
which
his
own
creations
move
certainly
no
romanino
of
the
great
public
galleries
arrests
the
imagination
like
the
madonna
of
san
francesco
and
in
its
presence
one
thinks
with
a
pang
of
all
the
beautiful
objects
uprooted
from
their
native
soil
to
adorn
the
herbarium
of
the
v
it
was
on
the
last
day
of
our
journey
that
the
most
imperturbable
member
of
the
party
looking
up
from
a
prolonged
study
of
the
announced
that
we
had
not
seen
the
bergamasque
alps
after
all
in
the
excited
argument
that
followed
proof
seemed
to
preponderate
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
but
a
closer
scrutiny
of
the
map
confirmed
the
fear
that
we
had
not
actually
penetrated
beyond
the
borders
of
the
promised
land
it
must
be
owned
that
at
first
the
discovery
was
somewhat
humiliating
but
on
reflection
it
left
us
overjoyed
to
think
that
we
had
still
the
bergamasque
alps
to
visit
meanwhile
our
pleasure
had
certainly
been
enhanced
by
our
delusion
and
we
remembered
with
fresh
admiration
goethe

profound
saying
a
saying

when
june
is
hot
on
the
long
yellow
streets
of

it
is
pleasant
to
take
train
for
the
biellese
that
romantic
where
the
last
slopes
of
the
pennine
alps
melt
into
the
piedmontese

the

crossing
the

its

westward
to

an
undulating
sea
of
green
but
to
the
north
it
breaks
abruptly
into
the
height
against
which
rises
the
terraced
outline
of
biella
the
cliffs
of
the
biellese
are
the
haunt
of
ancient
legend
and
on
almost
every
ledge
a
church
or
monastery
perpetuates
the
story
of
some
relic
biella
the
chief
town
of
this
devout
district
covers
a
small
conical
hill
and
spreads
its
suburbs
over
the
surrounding
level
its
hot
sociable
streets
are
full
of
the
shrill
activity
of
an
italian
but
the
transalpine
traveller
will
probably
be
inclined
to
push
on
at
once
to
the
village
of
andorno
an
hour
s
drive
deeper
in
the
hills
biella
overhangs
the
plain
but
andorno
lies
in
a
valley
which
soon
contracts
to
a
defile
between
the
mountains
the
drive
thither
from
biella
skirts
the
cervo
a
fresh
mountain
stream
and
passes
through
villages
set
on
slopes
in
the
ample
shade
of
the
houses
of
these
villages
have
little
of
the
picturesqueness
mistakenly
associated
with
italian
rural
architecture
but
every
window
displays
its
pot
of
lavender
or
of
carnations
and
the
arched
doorways
reveal
gardens
flecked
with
the
blue
shadows
of
the
andorno
itself
is
folded
in
hills
rounded
umbrageous
cooled
with
the
song
of
birds
a
sylvan
hush
envelops
the
place
and
the
air
one
breathes
seems
to
have
travelled
over
miles
of
forest
freshened
by
unseen
streams
it
is
all
as
still
and
drowsy
as
the
dream
of
a
tired
brain
there
is
nothing
to
see
but
the
country
itself
banks
sloping
to
the
stream
below
the

the
arch
of
a
ruined

an
old
hexagonal

and
an
arcade
of
stunted
columns
and
beyond
the
bridge
and
the

rich
upland
meadows
where
all

long
the
peasant
women
stoop
to
the
swing
of
the

in

in
this
high
country
where
patches
of
snow
still
lie
in
the
shaded
hollows
the
wild
flowers
of
spring
and
summer
seem
to
meet
narcissus
and

the
scenery
of
these
high
pennine
valleys
is
everywhere
marked
by
the
same
nobleness
of
colour
and
outline
the
same
atmosphere
of
spaciousness
and
poetry
it
is
the
rich
studied
landscape
of
bonifazio

idyls
a
scene
of
peace
and
plenitude
not
the
southern
opulence
but
the
sober
wealth
poured
from
a
glacial
horn
of
plenty
there
is
none
of
the
swiss
abruptness
of
the
swiss
accumulation

southern
aspect
softens
and
expands
there
is
no
crowding
of
impressions
but
a
stealing
sense
of
harmony
and
completeness
from
andorno
the
obvious
excursion
is
to
the
famous
shrine
of
san
giovanni
a
sight
taking
up
eight
pages
in
the
excellent
guida
del
biellese
but
remaining
in
the
traveller
s
memory
chiefly
as
the
objective
point
of
a
charming
walk
or
drive
the
road
thither
winds
up
the
val
d
andorno
between
heights
set
with
villages
hung
aloft
among
the
or
thrusting
their
above
the
spray
and
tumult
of
the
cervo
the
cliffs
are
scarred
with
quarries
of
sienite
and
the
stream
as
the
valley
narrows
forces
its
way
over
masses
of
rock
and
between
shelving
stony
banks
but
the
little
gardens
dashed
by
its
foam
overflow
with
irises
roses
and
peonies
surrounded
with
and
shaded
by
the
long
mauve
panicles
of
the
wistaria
presently
the
road
leaves
the
valley
and
ascends
the
flank
of
the
mountain
on
which
the
church
of
san
giovanni
is
perched
the
coolness
and
hush
of
this
wooded
are
delicious
after
the
noise
and
sunshine
of
the
open
road
and
one
is
struck
by
the
civic
amenity
which
in
this
remote
solitude
has
placed
benches
at
intervals
beneath
the
trees
at
length
the
brow
of
the
hill
is
reached
the
beeches
recede
leaving
a
grassy
plateau
flanked
by
a
long
façade
of
the
monastery
and
from
the
brink
of
this
open
space
the
eye
drops
unhindered
down
the
long
leafy
reaches
of
the
val
d
andorno
the
scene
is
characterized
by
the
tenderest
gradations
of
colour
and
line
beeches
blending
with
walnuts
these
with
the
tremulous
along
the
stream
and
the
curves
of
the
hills
flowing
into
one
another
till
they
lose
themselves
in
the
aërial
distances
of
the
plain
the
building
which
commands
this
outlook
is
hardly
worthy
of
its
station
unless
indeed
the
traveller
feels
its
sober
lines
to
be
an
admission
of
art
s
inferiority
to
nature
in
such
aspects
to
the
confirmed
apologist
of
italy
there
is
indeed
a
certain
charm
in
finding
so
insignificant
a
piece
of
architecture
in
so
rare
a
spot
as
though
in
a
land
thus
amply
dowered
no
architectural
emphasis
were
needed
to
call
attention
to
any
special
point
of
view
yet
a
tenderness
for
the
view
one
can
not
but
infer
must
have
guided
the
steps
of
those
early
cenobites
who
peopled
the
romantic
landscape
with
images
when
did
a
miracle
take
place
on
a
barren
plain
or
in
a
circumscribed
hollow
the
manifestations
of
divine
favour
invariably
sought
the
heights
and
those
who
dedicated
themselves
to
the
commemoration
of
such
holy
incidents
did
so
in
surroundings
poetic
enough
to
justify
their
faith
in
the
supernatural
illustration
inner
quadrangle
at
peixotto
loveire
the
church
with
its
dignified
front
and
sculptured
portal
adjoins
the
hospice
and
shows
little
of
interest
within
but
the
stone
grotto
containing
the
venerated
image
of
saint
john
discovered
in
the
third
century
by
saint
eusebius
bishop
of
vercelli
this
grotto
is
protected
by
an
iron
grating
and
its
dark
recess
twinkles
with
silver
hearts
and
other
votive
offerings
the
place
is
still
a
favourite
pilgrimage
but
there
seems
to
be
some
doubt
as
to
which
saint
john
has
chosen
it
as
the
scene
of
his
posthumous
thaumaturgy
for
according
to
the
local
it
is
equally
frequented
on
the
feasts
of
the
baptist
and
of
the
evangelist
this
uncertainty
is
not
without
its
practical
advantages
and
one
reads
that
the
hospice
is
open
the
year
round
and
that
an
excellent
meal
may
always
be
enjoyed
in
the
above
the
arcade
while
on
the
feasts
of
the
respective
saints
it
is
necessary
for
the
devotee
to
bespeak
his
board
and
lodging
in
advance
if
san
giovanni
appeals
chiefly
to
the
lover
of
landscape
the
more
famous
sanctuary
of
oropa
is
of
special
interest
to
the
architect
for
thither
in
the
eighteenth
century
the
piety
of
the
house
of
savoy
sent
juvara
one
of
the
greatest
architects
of
his
time
to
add
a
grand
façade
and
portico
to
the
group
of
monastic
buildings
erected
a
hundred
years
earlier
by
negro
di
pralungo
the
ascent
to
the
great
of
the
black
virgin
leads
the
traveller
back
to
biella
and
up
the
hills
behind
the
town
the
drive
is
long
but
so
diversified
so
abounding
in
beauty
that
in
nearing
its
end
one
feels
the
need
of
an
impressive
monument
to
close
so
nobly
ordered
an
approach
as
the
road
rises
above
the
vineyards
of
biella
as
the
the
and
the
last
suburban
villas
drop
below
the
line
of
vision
there
breaks
upon
the
eye
the
vast
undulating
reach
of
the
piedmontese
plain
from
the
near
massing
of
cultivated
verdure
the
orchards
gardens
groves
of
the
minutely
pencilled
foreground
to
the
far
limit
where
earth
and
sky
converge
in
silver
the
landscape
glides
through
every
gradation
of
loveliness
first
the
val
d
andorno
unbosoms
its
wooded
depths
then
the
distances
press
nearer
and
dappled
with
forest
with
the
towns
of
biella
novara
and
vercelli
like
white
fleets
anchored
on
a
misty
sea
this
view
with
its
fold
on
fold
of
woodland
in
the
foreground
then
dark
blue
with
dashes
of
tawny
sunlight
and
purple
streaks
of
rain
till
it
fades
into
the
indeterminate
light
of
the
horizon
suggests
some
heroic
landscape
of
poussin
s
or
the
boundless
russet
distances
of
rubens
s
château
of
meanwhile
the
foreground
is
perpetually
changing
the
air
freshens
the
villages
with
their
and
their
guardian
images
of
the
black
virgin
are
left
behind
and
between
the
beeches
rise
bare
gravelly
slopes
backed
by
treeless
hills
the
loreto
of
piedmont
lies
nearly
four
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
and
even
in
june
there
is
a
touch
of
snow
in
the
air
for
a
moment
one
fancies
one
s
self
in
switzerland
but
here
at
the
bend
of
the
road
is
a
white
chapel
with
a
classic
porch
within
which
a
group
of
figures
enact
some
episode
of
the
passion
italy
has
reasserted
herself
and
art
has
humanized
the
landscape
more
chapels
are
scattered
through
the
trees
but
one
forgets
to
note
them
as
the
carriage
turns
into
a
wide
grassy
forecourt
bordered
by
stone
pyramids
and
dominated
at
its
farther
end
by
the
great
colonnade
of
the
hospice
a
with
fine
iron
gates
leads
up
to
an
outer
court
enclosed
in
the
arcaded
wings
of
the
building
under
these
arcades
are
to
be
found
shops
in
which
the
pilgrim
may
satisfy
his
various
wants
from
groceries
wines
and
cotton
umbrellas
much
needed
in
these
showery
hills
to
rosaries
images
of
the
black
virgin
and
pious
histories
of
her
miracles
above
the
arcades
the
pilgrims
are
lodged
and
in
the
centre
of
the
inner
façade
juvara
s
marble
portico
unfolds
its
double
flight
of
steps
passing
through
this
gateway
one
stands
in
a
spacious
inner
quadrangle
this
again
is
enclosed
in
low
buildings
resting
on
arcades
their
alignment
broken
only
by
the
modest
façade
of
the
church
outside
there
is
the
profane
bustle
of
life
the
clatter
of
glasses
at
the
doors
of
rival
the
cracking
of
whips
the
stir
of
buying
and
selling
but
a
warm
silence
holds
the
inner
court
only
a
few
old
peasant
women
are
hobbling
rosary
in
hand
over
the
flags
to
the
cool
shelter
of
the
church
the
church
is
indeed
cavernously
cold
with
that
subterranean
chill
peculiar
to
religious
buildings
the
interior
is
smaller
and
plainer
than
one
had
expected
but
presently
it
is
seen
to
be
covered
with
a
decoration
beside
which
the
rarest
tapestry
or
fresco
might
sink
into
insignificance
this
covering
is
composed
of
innumerable
votive
offerings
crowding
each
other
from
floor
to
vaulting
over
every
inch
of
wall
lighting
the
chapels
with
a
shimmer
of
silver
and
tinsel
with
the
yellow
of
old
wax
legs
and
arms
and
the
gleam
of
tarnished
each
overlapping
scale
of
this
strange
sheath
symbolizing
some
impulse
of
longing
grief
or
gratitude
so
that
as
it
were
the
whole
church
is
lined
with
most
of
these
offerings
are
the
gift
of
the
poor
and
the
paintings
record
with
artless
realism
the
miraculous
escapes
of
carters
quarrymen
and
in
the
choir
however
hang
a
few
portraits
of
noble
donators
in
ruffs
and
spanish
jerkins
and
one
picture
rudely
painted
on
the
wall
itself
renders
with
touching
fidelity
the
interior
of
a
peasant
s
house
in
the
sixteenth
or
seventeenth
century
with
the
mother
kneeling
by
a
cradle
over
which
the
black
virgin
sheds
her
reassuring
light
the
ebony
virgin
herself
another
find
of
the
indefatigable
saint
eusebius
is
enthroned
behind
the
high
altar
in
a
tiny
chapel
built
by
her
discoverer
where
in
a
blaze
of
the
miraculous
image
nimbused
in
jewels
and
gold
showers
a
dazzling
brightness
on
the
groups
who
succeed
each
other
at
her
iron
lattice
the
air
and
the
sweating
stone
walls
encrusted
with
votive
offerings
recall
at
once
the
chapel
of
loreto
but
here
the
smaller
space
the
deeper
dusk
heighten
the
sense
of
holiness
and
solemnity
and
if
a
few
sisters
are
grouped
against
the
grating
while
before
the
altar
a
young
priest
intones
the
mystic
purissima
mater
admirabile
mater
prudentissima
punctuated
by
the
wailing
pro
nobis
of
the
nuns
it
would
be
hard
to
picture
a
scene
richer
in
that
mingling
of
suavity
and
awe
with
which
the
church
composes
her
incomparable
effects
after
so
complex
an
impression
the
pleasures
of
the
eye
may
seem
a
trifle
thin
yet
there
is
a
great
charm
in
the
shaded
walks
winding
through
the
colony
of
chapels
above
the
monastery
nothing
in
nature
is
lovelier
than
a
rustling
with
streams
and
to
come
in
such
a
setting
on
one
graceful
after
another
to
discover
in
their
porches
groups
of
peasants
praying
before
some
dim
presentment
of
the
passion
gives
a
renewed
sense
of
the
way
in
which
in
italy
nature
art
and
religion
combine
to
enrich
the
humblest
lives
these
sacred
mounts
or
stations
of
the
cross
are
scattered
everywhere
on
the
italian
slopes
of
the
alps
the
most
famous
is
at
varallo
and
to
find
any
artistic
merit
one
must
go
there
or
to
san
vivaldo
in
tuscany
or
the
unknown
of
cerveno
in
the
val
camonica
at
oropa
the
groups
are
relatively
crude
and
uninteresting
but
the
mysterious
in
which
they
are
seen
and
the
surrounding
murmur
of
leaves
and
water
give
them
a
value
quite
independent
of
their
plastic
qualities
varallo
itself
is
but
a
day
s
journey
from
andorno
and
in
june
weather
the
drive
thither
is
beautiful
the
narrow
country
road
mounts
through
as
fine
as
those
which
cast
their
velvet
shade
for
miles
about
promontogno
in
the
val
bregaglia
at
first
the
way
dips
continuously
from
one
green
ravine
to
another
but
at
mosso
santa
maria
the
highest
point
of
the
ascent
the
glorious
plain
again
bursts
into
view
with
white
roads
winding
toward
distant
cities
and
the
near
flanks
of
the
hills
clothed
in
unbroken
forest
the
val
sesia
is
broader
than
the
val
d
andorno
and
proportionately
less
picturesque
but
its
expanse
of
wheat
and
vine
checkered
with
shade
and
overhung
by
mossy
rocks
offers
a
restful
contrast
to
the
landscape
of
the
higher
valleys
as
varallo
is
neared
the
hills
close
in
again
and
the
scenery
regains
its
character
the
first
unforgettable
glimpse
of
the
old
town
is
caught
suddenly
at
a
bend
of
the
road
with
the
sanctuary
lifted
high
above
the
river
and
tiled
roofs
and
clustered
at
its
base
the
near
approach
is
a
disenchantment
for
few
towns
have
suffered
more
than
varallo
under
the
knife
of
modern
improvement
and
those
who
did
not
know
it
in
earlier
days
would
hardly
guess
that
it
was
once
the
most
picturesque
town
in
north
italy
a
dusty
suburb
thinly
scattered
with
cheap
villas
now
leads
from
the
station
to
the
edge
of
the
old
town
and
the
beautiful
slope
facing
the
sacred
mountain
has
been
cleared
of
its
natural
growth
and
planted
with
moribund
palms
and
camellias
to
form
the
pleasure
grounds
of
a
huge
stucco
hotel
with
failure
written
over
every
inch
of
its
pretentious
façade
one
knows
not
whether
to
lament
the
impairment
of
such
rare
completeness
or
to
find
consolation
in
the
fact
that
varallo
is
rich
enough
not
to
be
ruined
by
its
losses
ten
or
fifteen
years
ago
every
aspect
was
enchanting
now
one
must
choose
one
s
point
of
view
but
one
or
two
of
the
finest
are
still
intact
turning
one
s
back
for
instance
on
the
offending
hotel
one
has
still
on
a
summer
morning
the
rarest
vision
of
wood
and
water
and
architecture
the
sesia
with
its
soft
meadows
and
leafy
banks
the
old
houses
huddled
above
it
and
the
high
cliff
crowned
by
the
chapels
of
the
sacred
way
at
night
all
melts
to
a
diviner
loveliness
the
clustered
darkness
of
the
town
twinkling
with
lights
lies
folded
in
hills
delicately
traced
against
a
sky
mauve
with
moonlight
here
and
there
the
moon
burnishes
a
sombre
mass
of
trees
or
makes
a
campanile
stand
out
pale
and
definite
as
ivory
while
high
above
the
summit
of
the
cliff
projects
against
the
sky
with
an
almost
greek
purity
of
outline
the
white
domes
and
arches
of
the
sanctuary
the
centre
of
the
town
is
also
undisturbed
here
one
may
wander
through
cool
narrow
streets
with
shops
full
of
devotional
emblems
and
of
the
tall
votive
candles
gaily
spangled
with
gold
and
painted
with
and
of
the
virgin
these
streets
on
sundays
are
thronged
with
the
peasant
women
of
the
neighbouring
valleys
in
their
various
costumes
some
with
cloth
leggings
and
short
cloth
petticoats
embroidered
in
colours
others
in
skirts
of
plaited
black
silk
with
embroidered
jackets
silver
necklaces
and
spreading
for
nearly
every
town
has
its
distinctive
dress
and
some
happy
accident
seems
to
have
preserved
this
slope
of
the
alps
from
the
depressing
uniformity
of
modern
fashions
in
architectural
effects
the
town
is
little
richer
than
its
neighbours
but
it
has
that
indescribable
tone
in
which
the
soft
texture
of
old
stucco
and
the
bloom
of
marble
combine
with
a
hundred
happy
accidents
of
sun
and
shade
to
produce
what
might
be
called
the
of
italy
there
is
indeed
one
remarkable
church
with
a
high
double
flight
of
steps
leading
to
its
door
but
this
though
it
contains
a
fine
gaudenzio
passes
as
a
mere
incident
in
the
general
picturesqueness
and
the
only
church
with
which
the
seriously
reckons
is
that
of
santa
maria
delle
grazie
frescoed
with
the
artist
s
scenes
from
the
passion
illustration
main
court
of
the
sacro
monte
at
peixotto
varallo
there
is
much
beauty
of
detail
in
these
crowded
compositions
but
to
the
inexpert
gaudenzio
lives
perhaps
chiefly
as
the
painter
of
the
choiring
angels
of
saronno
so
great
there
that
elsewhere
he
seems
relatively
unimportant
at
varallo
at
least
one
associates
him
first
with
the
sacred
mountain
to
this
great
monument
of
his
native
valley
he
contributed
some
of
his
most
memorable
work
and
it
seems
fitting
that
on
turning
from
his
frescoes
in
santa
maria
one
should
find
one
s
self
at
the
foot
of
the
path
leading
to
the
sanctuary
the
wide
approach
paved
with
tiny
round
pebbles
polished
by
the
feet
of
thousands
of
pilgrims
leads
round
the
flank
of
the
cliff
to
the
enclosure
on
its
summit
here
on
the
ledge
overlooking
the
town
stands
the
church
built
by
saint
charles
borromeo
now
disfigured
by
a
modern
façade
and
grouped
about
it
are
the
chapels
of
the
new
these
little
buildings
to
which
one
mounts
or
descends
by
mossy
winding
paths
beneath
the
trees
present
every
variety
of
design
some
placed
at
different
levels
are
connected
by
open
colonnades
and
long
flights
of
steps
some
have
airy
loggias
overlooking
gardens
tufted
with
and
the
lilac
iris
while
others
stand
withdrawn
in
the
deep
shade
of
the
beeches
each
chapel
contains
a
group
representing
some
scene
in
the
divine
history
and
the
site
and
architecture
of
each
building
have
been
determined
by
a
subtle
sense
of
dramatic
fitness
thus
the
chapels
enclosing
the
earlier
episodes
the
annunciation
the
nativity
and
the
scenes
previous
to
the
last
supper
are
placed
in
relatively
open
sites
with
patches
of
flowers
about
their
doorsteps
while
as
the
drama
darkens
the
pilgrim
descends
into
deep
shady
hollows
or
winds
along
chill
stone
corridors
and
up
and
down
interminable
stairs
a
dark
subterranean
passage
leading
at
last
to
the
image
of
the
buried
christ
of
the
groups
themselves
it
is
difficult
to
speak
dispassionately
for
they
are
so
much
a
part
of
their
surroundings
that
one
can
hardly
measure
them
by
any
conventional
standard
to
do
so
indeed
would
be
to
miss
their
meaning
they
must
be
studied
as
a
reflection
of
the
bible
story
in
the
hearts
of
simple
and
emotional
peasants
for
it
was
the
piety
of
the
that
called
them
into
being
and
the
modellers
and
painters
who
contributed
to
the
work
were
mostly
natives
of
val
sesia
or
of
the
neighbouring
valleys
the
art
of
clay
modelling
is
peculiarly
adapted
to
the
rendering
of
strong
and
direct
emotions
so
much
vivacity
of
expression
do
its
rapid
evocations
permit
that
one
might
almost
describe
it
as
intermediate
between
pantomime
and
sculpture
the
groups
at
varallo
have
the
defects
inherent
in
such
an
improvisation
the
crudeness
the
violence
sometimes
even
the
seeming
absurdities
of
an
instantaneous
photograph
these
faults
are
redeemed
by
a
simplicity
and
realism
which
have
not
had
time
to
harden
into
conventionality
the
virgin
and
saint
elizabeth
are
peasant
women
the
romping
children
the
dwarfs
and
hunchbacks
the
roman
soldiers
and
the
jewish
priests
have
all
been
transferred
alive
from
the
of
borgo
sesia
and
arona
these
expressive
figures
dressed
in
real
clothes
with
real
hair
flowing
about
their
shoulders
seem
like
the
actors
in
some
arrested
at
its
crowning
moment
closer
inspection
brings
to
light
a
marked
difference
in
quality
between
the
different
groups
those
by
tabacchetti
and
fermo
stella
are
the
best
excepting
only
the
remarkable
scene
of
the
crucifixion
attributed
to
gaudenzio
and
probably
executed
from
his
design
tabacchetti
is
the
artist
of
the
adam
and
eve
surrounded
by
the
flora
and
fauna
of
eden
a
curious
composition
with
a
eve
of
mincing
elegance
and
refinement
to
stella
are
due
some
of
the
simplest
and
most
moving
scenes
of
the
series
the
adoration
of
the
magi
the
message
of
the
angel
to
joseph
and
christ
and
the
woman
of
samaria
especially
charming
is
the
annunciation
where
a
angel
in
a
kind
of
celestial
of
flowered
brocade
advances
lily
in
hand
toward
a
virgin
dressed
as
one
is
told
in
a
costume
presented
by
a
pious
lady
of
varallo
in
another
scene
the
mother
of
god
habited
like
a
peasant
of
val
sesia
looks
up
smilingly
from
the
on
which
she
is
at
work
while
the
last
supper
probably
a
survival
of
the
older
wooden
groups
existing
before
gaudenzio
and
his
school
took
up
the
work
shows
a
linen
with
bread
and
fruit
set
out
on
real
faenza
dishes
after
these
homely
details
the
scenes
of
the
passion
where
gaudenzio
s
influence
probably
prevailed
seem
a
trifle
academic
but
even
here
there
are
local
touches
such
as
the
curly
white
dog
at
the
foot
of
herod
s
throne
the
rags
of
the
beggars
the
child
in
the
crucifixion
holding
a
spotted
hound
in
leash
the
crucifixion
is
fitly
the
culminating
point
of
the
series
here
gaudenzio
lined
the
background
with
one
of
his
noblest
frescoes
and
the
figures
placed
before
it
are
worthy
in
expression
and
attitude
to
carry
out
the
master
s
conception
the
roman
knight
on
his
white
charger
the
eager
gaping
throng
where
beggars
and
cripples
jostle
turbaned
fine
ladies
and
their
dwarfs
where
lombard
women
with
children
at
the
breast
press
forward
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
dying
christ
while
the
hideous
soldiers
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
draw
lots
for
the
seamless
garment
all
these
crowding
careless
figures
bring
out
with
strange
intensity
the
agony
uplifted
in
their
midst
never
perhaps
has
the
popular
the
unimpressed
unrepentant
side
of
the
scene
been
set
forth
with
more
tragic
directness
one
can
fancy
the
knight
echoing
in
after
years
the
musing
words
of
anatole
france
s
de
jésus
jésus
de
nazareth
je
ne
me
rappelle
from
varallo
the
fortunate
traveller
may
carry
his
impressions
unimpaired
through
the
and
across
the
hills
to
the
lake
of
orta
a
small
sheet
of
water
enclosed
in
richest
verdure
with
the
wooded
island
of
san
giuliano
on
its
bosom
orta
has
a
secret
charm
of
its
own
a
quality
of
solitude
of
remoteness
that
makes
it
seem
the
special
property
of
each
traveller
who
chances
to
discover
it
here
too
is
a
sacred
way
surmounting
the
usual
knoll
above
the
town
the
groups
have
little
artistic
merit
but
there
is
a
solemn
charm
in
the
tranquil
glades
with
their
little
shrines
connected
by
grass
walks
under
a
continuous
vaulting
of
branches
the
chief
feature
of
orta
however
is
the
incredibly
complete
little
island
with
its
ancient
church
embosomed
in
gardens
yet
even
this
counts
only
as
a
detail
in
the
general
composition
a
last
touch
to
the
prodigal
picturesqueness
of
the
place
the
lake
itself
is
begirt
by
slopes
and
in
every
direction
roads
and
lead
across
the
wooded
hills
through
glades
sheeted
in
with
primroses
and
to
the
deeper
at
the
foot
of
the
high
alps
in
any
other
country
the
departure
from
such
perfect
loveliness
must
lead
to
an
but
there
is
no
limit
to
the
prodigality
of
the
italian
landscape
and
the
wanderer
who
turns
eastward
from
orta
may
pass
through
scenes
of
undiminished
beauty
till
toward
sunset
the
hills
divide
to
show
lake
maggiore
at
his
feet
with
the
isola
bella
moored
like
a
fantastic
upon
its
waters
what
the
hermits
saw
in
almost
every
gallery
of
italy
there
hangs
among
the
pictures
of
the
earlier
period
one
which
represents
with
loving
minuteness
of
topographical
detail
a
rocky
honeycombed
with
caves
and
inhabited
by
hermits
as
a
rule
the
landscape
is
comprehensive
enough
to
include
the
whole
thebaid
with
the
river
at
the
base
of
the
cliff
the
fledging
the
mountain
steep
by
steep
and
the
various
little
edifices
huts
chapels
and
bridges
with
which
the
colony
of
anchorites
have
humanized
their
wild
domain
this
presentment
of
the
life
of
the
solitaries
always
remained
a
favourite
subject
in
italian
art
and
even
in
the
rococo
period
when
piety
had
become
a
accomplishment
the
traditional
charm
of
the
life
apart
was
commemorated
by
the
mock
hermitages
to
be
found
in
every
nobleman
s
park
or
by
such
frescoes
as
adorn
the
entrance
to
the
chapel
of
the
villa
chigi
near
rome
a
tiny
room
painted
to
represent
a
rocky
cleft
in
the
mountains
with
anchorites
visiting
each
other
in
their
caves
or
engaged
in
the
duties
of
their
sylvan
existence
a
vast
body
of
literature
and
of
a
literature
peculiarly
accessible
to
the
people
has
kept
alive
in
catholic
countries
the
image
of
the
early
solitary
the
golden
legend
the
great
bollandist
compilations
and
many
other
collections
of
pious
anecdote
preserve
in
simple
and
almost
childish
form
the
names
and
deeds
of
the
desert
saints
in
the
traditions
of
the
latin
race
there
still
lingers
no
doubt
a
memory
of
the
dark
days
when
all
that
was
gentle
and
merciful
and
humane
turned
to
the
desert
to
escape
the
desolation
of
the
country
and
the
foulness
of
the
town
from
war
and
slavery
and
famine
from
the
strife
of
the
circus
factions
and
the
incredible
vices
and
treacheries
of
civilized
life
the
disenchanted
christian
aghast
at
the
more
than
pagan
corruption
of
a
converted
world
fled
into
the
waste
places
to
wear
out
his
life
in
penance
the
horrors
he
left
behind
surpassed
anything
the
desert
could
show
surpassed
even
the
terrors
that
walked
by
night
the
airy
tongues
that
syllabled
men
s
names
the
lemurs
succubi
and
painted
demons
of
the
tombs
nevertheless
the
lives
of
the
early
anchorites
who
took
refuge
in
the
burning
solitudes
of
egypt
and
asia
minor
were
full
of
fears
and
anguish
their
history
echoes
with
the
groans
and
lamentations
of
souls
in
pain
and
had
their
lives
been
recorded
by
contemporary
artists
the
presentment
must
have
recalled
those
horribly
circumstantial
studies
of
everlasting
torment
which
admonished
the
mediæval
worshipper
from
the
walls
of
every
church
but
when
italian
art
began
to
chronicle
the
history
of
the
desert
fathers
a
change
had
passed
over
the
spirit
of
christianity
if
the
world
was
still
a
dark
place
full
of
fears
and
evil
solitary
communion
with
god
had
ceased
to
become
a
more
dreadful
alternative
and
when
men
went
forth
into
the
desert
they
found
christ
there
rather
than
the
devil
so
at
least
one
infers
from
the
spirit
in
which
the
italian
painters
rendered
the
life
of
the
thebaid
transposing
its
scenes
from
the
parched
african
desert
to
their
own
fertile
landscape
and
infusing
into
the
lives
of
the
desert
fathers
that
sense
of
human
fellowship
with
which
saint
francis
had
penetrated
the
mediæval
conception
of
christianity
the
first
hermits
shunned
each
other
as
they
shunned
the
image
of
evil
every
human
relation
was
a
snare
and
they
sought
each
other
out
only
in
moments
of
moral
or
physical
extremity
when
flesh
or
spirit
quailed
before
the
hallucinations
of
solitude
but
in
the
italian
pictures
the
hermits
move
in
an
atmosphere
of
fraternal
tenderness
though
they
still
lead
the
life
apart
it
is
shorn
of
its
grimness
and
mitigated
by
acts
of
friendly
ministry
and
innocent
childlike
intercourse
the
solitaries
still
dwell
in
remote
inaccessible
regions
and
for
the
most
part
their
lives
are
spent
alone
but
on
the
feasts
of
the
church
they
visit
each
other
and
when
they
go
on
pilgrimage
they
pause
at
each
other
s
thresholds
yet
though
one
feels
that
this
new
spirit
has
tamed
the
desert
and
transplanted
to
it
enough
of
the
leaven
of
human
intercourse
to
exorcise
its
evil
spirits
the
imagination
remains
chiefly
struck
by
the
strangeness
of
the
conditions
in
which
these
voluntary
exiles
must
have
found
themselves
the
hermits
brought
little
with
them
from
the
world
of
cities
and
men
compared
to
what
they
found
in
the
wilderness
their
relation
to
the
earth
their
ancient
mysterious
mother
must
have
been
the
most
intimate
as
well
as
the
most
interesting
part
of
their
lives
as
a
return
to
nature
the
experience
had
a
freshness
and
intensity
which
the
modern
seeker
after
primeval
sensations
can
never
hope
to
recover
for
in
those
days
when
distances
were
measured
by
the
pilgrim
s
sandal
or
the
ass
s
hoof
a
few
miles
meant
exile
and
the
mountain
visible
from
the
walls
of
his
native
town
offered
the
solitary
as
complete
an
isolation
as
the
slopes
of
lebanon
news
travelled
at
the
same
pace
when
it
did
not
drop
by
the
way
there
was
little
security
outside
the
city
walls
and
small
incentive
for
the
traveller
except
from
devotional
motives
to
seek
out
the
anchorite
on
his
inaccessible
height
the
hermit
therefore
was
thrown
back
on
the
companionship
of
the
wild
and
what
he
won
from
it
we
read
in
the
gentler
legends
of
the
desert
and
in
the
records
of
the
early
italian
artists
much
for
instance
is
told
of
the
delightful
nature
of
the
intercourse
between
the
solitaries
and
wild
animals
the
lion
having
been
the
typical
denizen
of
the
libyan
sands
the
italian
painter
has
transplanted
him
to
the
umbrian
where
jointly
with
the
wolf
and
the
stag
he
lives
in
gentle
community
with
the
anchorites
for
instead
of
fleeing
from
or
fighting
these
lords
of
the
wilderness
the
wise
hermits
at
once
entered
into
negotiations
with
them
negotiations
sometimes
resulting
in
friendships
and
sealed
by
the
death
of
the
adoring
animal
it
was
of
course
the
power
of
the
cross
which
subjugated
these
savage
beasts
and
many
instances
are
recorded
of
the
control
exercised
over
wild
animals
and
the
contrition
awakened
in
them
by
the
conquering
sign
but
the
hermits
not
content
with
asserting
their
spiritual
predominance
over
these
poor
soulless
creatures
sono
seemed
to
feel
that
such
a
victory
was
too
easy
and
were
themselves
won
over
by
the
devotion
of
their
dumb
friends
and
drawn
into
a
brotherly
commerce
which
no
law
of
the
church
prescribed
the
mystical
natural
history
of
the
first
christian
centuries
facilitated
the
belief
in
this
intercourse
between
man
and
beast
when
even
familiar
domestic
animals
were
credited
with
strange
symbolic
attributes
it
was
natural
to
people
the
wild
with
the
dragon
the
hydra
and
the
cocatrix
to
believe
that
the
young
of
the
elephant
were
engendered
by
their
mothers
eating
of
the
mandragora
which
grows
on
a
mount
near
paradise
that
those
of
the
lion
were
born
dead
and
resuscitated
by
their
parents
breath
and
that
the
old
eagle
renewed
his
youth
by
plunging
three
times
in
a
magic
fountain
it
is
not
strange
that
creatures
so
marvellously
endowed
should
have
entered
into
friendly
relations
with
the
human
intruders
upon
their
solitude
and
subdued
their
savage
natures
to
the
teachings
of
their
new
masters
and
as
the
lion
and
the
wolf
were
gradually
transformed
into
humble
but
wise
companions
so
the
other
influences
of
the
wilderness
came
to
acquire
a
power
over
the
solitaries
even
after
the
early
thebaids
had
been
gathered
in
under
one
or
another
of
the
great
monastic
rules
seekers
after
holiness
continued
to
flee
the
communal
life
and
in
italy
every
lonely
height
came
to
have
its
recluse
it
was
impossible
that
these
little
restricted
human
lives
going
forth
singly
into
the
desert
should
not
be
gradually
absorbed
into
it
and
saturated
with
its
spirit
think
what
a
or
experience
it
must
have
been
to
the
dweller
in
the
narrow
walled
town
or
the
narrower
monastery
to
go
forth
alone
beyond
the
ploughed
fields
and
the
road
to
the
next
village
beyond
the
haunts
of
men
and
hail
of
friendly
voices
forth
into
the
unmapped
region
of
hills
and
forests
where
wild
beasts
and
robbers
and
other
presences
less
definable
but
more
baleful
lay
in
wait
for
the
lonely
traveller
from
robbers
there
was
not
much
to
fear
the
solitaries
were
poor
and
it
was
a
great
sin
to
lay
hands
on
them
the
wild
beasts
too
might
be
won
over
to
christian
amity
but
what
of
those
other
presences
of
which
the
returning
traveller
whispered
over
the
evening
fire
at
first
no
doubt
the
feeling
of
awe
was
uppermost
and
only
the
heart
inflated
with
divine
love
could
sustain
the
assaults
of
fear
and
loneliness
but
gradually
as
the
noise
of
cities
died
out
as
the
ear
became
inured
to
the
vast
hush
of
nature
and
the
mind
to
the
delicious
recurrence
of
untroubled
hours
then
wonderfully
imperceptibly
the
spirit
of
the
hermit
must
have
put
forth
tendrils
of
sympathy
and
intelligence
toward
the
mysterious
world
about
him
think
of
the
joy
of
escaping
from
the
ceaseless
brawls
the
dirt
disease
and
misery
of
the
mediæval
town
or
from
the
bickering
the
the
mechanical
devotions
of
the
crowded
monastery
think
of
the
wonder
of
entering
alone
and
undisturbed
into
communion
with
this
vast
still
world
of
cliff
and
cataract
of
bird
and
beast
and
flower
there
were
of
course
different
kinds
of
hermits
the
dull
kind
whose
only
object
was
to
escape
from
the
turmoil
and
rivalry
of
the
city
or
the
toil
and
floggings
of
the
farm
and
to
live
drowsily
in
a
warm
cleft
of
the
rocks
not
too
far
from
the
other
solitaries
high
above
the
populous
plain
alternately
harried
by
war
and
pestilence
and
there
was
the
ecstatic
so
filled
with
the
immanent
light
that
he
saw
neither
cliff
nor
cataract
that
the
various
face
of
nature
was
no
more
to
him
than
a
window
of
clear
glass
opening
on
the
brightness
of
the
beatific
vision
but
there
must
have
been
a
third
kind
also
the
kind
in
whom
the
divine
love
instead
of
burning
like
a
cold
inward
flame
overflowed
on
the
whole
world
about
him
to
whom
in
this
new
immediate
contact
with
nature
the
swallow
became
a
sister
the
wolf
a
brother
the
very
clods
lovers
and
lamps
mute
saint
francises
born
out
of
their
due
time
to
whom
the
life
of
nature
revealed
inarticulately
but
profoundly
the
bond
of
brotherhood
between
man
and
the
soil
it
was
to
these
solitaries
that
the
wilderness
truly
confessed
itself
yielding
up
once
more
all
the
terror
and
the
poetry
of
its
ancient
life
for
the
cliffs
and
forests
shunned
of
men
had
not
always
been
thus
deserted
and
always
there
had
throbbed
in
them
the
pulse
of
that
strange
intermediate
life
between
the
man
and
the
clod
of
which
the
tradition
lingers
in
all
lonely
places
the
hermits
of
course
knew
this
the
life
of
ancient
days
was
still
close
to
them
they
knew
also
that
the
power
of
the
cross
had
banished
from
temple
and
from
garden
house
and
vineyard
a
throng
of
tutelary
beings
on
whom
the
welfare
of
men
had
once
been
thought
to
depend
but
who
had
now
been
declared
false
to
their
trust
and
driven
forth
to
join
their
brothers
of
the
hills
and
woods
this
knowledge
rested
on
no
vague
rumours
but
on
authenticated
fact
were
not
many
of
the
old
temples
still
standing
some
built
into
the
walls
of
christian
churches
others
falling
into
desecrated
ruin
on
lonely
cliff
and
promontory
and
was
it
not
known
that
in
these
latter
the
wraiths
of
the
old
gods
still
reassembled
many
pilgrims
and
travellers
bore
witness
to
the
fact
who
had
not
heard
of
the
jewish
wayfarer
overtaken
by
night
in
a
lonely
country
who
sought
shelter
in
a
ruined
temple
of
apollo
and
would
have
been
blasted
by
the
god
and
his
attendant
demons
had
he
not
converted
by
fear
dispelled
the
unholy
rout
with
the
sign
of
the
cross
a
tangle
of
classic
and
mediæval
traditions
greek
etruscan
and
germanic
in
which
the
gods
of
the
thessalian
glades
and
the
werewolves
of
northern
forests
rode
the
midnight
blast
in
the
of
a
wild
walpurgisnacht
haunted
the
background
of
life
in
that
confused
age
when
ignorant
armies
clashed
by
night
on
the
battleground
of
the
awakening
human
intelligence
to
the
citizen
hugging
the
city
walls
this
supernatural
world
was
dark
with
images
of
sin
and
fear
but
to
the
dweller
in
the
forest
bold
enough
to
affront
the
greater
terrors
of
it
must
have
offered
a
mitigating
sense
of
fellowship
that
it
did
so
is
proved
even
by
some
of
the
earliest
legends
it
was
not
always
in
forms
of
peril
and
perdition
that
the
banished
gods
manifested
themselves
to
the
votaries
of
the
usurper
to
the
dweller
in
the
city
they
may
have
come
in
vengeful
shape
like
the
venus
entière
à
sa
proie
who
held
fast
to
the
christian
bridegroom
s
ring
though
surely
here
one
catches
a
note
of
the
old
longing
but
in
their
native
solitude
they
seem
to
have
appeared
propitiatingly
with
timid
proffers
of
service
as
when
saint
anthony
travelling
in
search
of
a
was
guided
on
his
way
first
by
a
centaur
and
then
by
a
little
man
with
hoofs
like
a
for
generations
indeed
for
centuries
even
in
that
time
the
divinities
of
the
old
dispensation
must
have
remained
more
familiar
to
the
simple
people
than
the
strange
new
god
of
israel
often
they
must
have
stolen
back
in
the
twilight
to
surprise
and
comfort
the
unlettered
toilers
who
still
believed
in
them
still
secretly
offered
them
the
dripping
honeycomb
and
bowl
of
ewe
s
milk
or
hung
garlands
in
the
cleft
tree
which
they
haunted
to
some
of
these
humble
hearts
grieving
for
their
old
fireside
gods
and
a
little
bewildered
by
the
demands
of
the
great
forbidding
christ
who
frowned
from
the
golden
heights
of
the
byzantine
apse
the
return
to
nature
must
have
been
like
a
coming
home
to
the
instinctive
endearing
ways
of
childhood
how
could
they
be
alarmed
by
the
sight
of
these
old
exiled
gods
familiars
of
the
hearth
and
garden
they
who
had
been
born
to
the
sense
of
such
presences
to
intercourse
with
beings
who
linked
man
to
the
soil
that
nurtured
him
and
the
roof
beneath
which
he
slept
even
the
most
holy
and
learned
men
of
the
first
christian
centuries
did
not
question
the
actual
existence
of
the
heathen
gods
and
the
fathers
of
the
church
expended
volumes
of
controversy
in
discussing
their
origin
and
their
influence
on
a
christianized
world
a
strange
conflict
of
opinion
waged
around
this
burning
question
by
the
greater
number
of
authorities
the
old
gods
were
believed
to
be
demons
emanations
of
the
mysterious
spirit
of
evil
himself
the
ahriman
of
the
ancient
eastern
dualism
who
had
cleverly
smuggled
himself
into
the
new
christian
creed
yet
the
oracles
though
usually
regarded
as
the
voices
of
these
demons
were
always
believed
in
and
quoted
by
the
christian
church
and
the
history
of
the
dark
ages
abounds
in
allusion
to
the
authority
of
the
sibylline
books
while
christian
scholarship
thus
struggled
under
the
spell
of
the
old
beliefs
how
could
the
artisan
and
serf
have
freed
themselves
from
it
gradually
indeed
the
church
foreseeing
the
perils
of
a
divided
allegiance
and
fearing
the
baleful
loveliness
of
the
old
gods
was
to
transform
their
myths
into
christian
legend
and
so
supply
a
new
throng
of
anthropomorphic
conceptions
for
minds
unable
to
keep
their
faith
alive
on
the
thin
abstractions
of
the
schoolmen
the
iconography
of
the
early
church
bears
witness
to
the
skill
with
which
these
adaptations
were
effected
and
the
slender
young
olympians
and
their
symbols
pressed
into
the
service
of
the
new
faith
but
it
was
long
before
the
results
of
this
process
reached
the
popular
mind
and
meanwhile
the
old
gods
lived
on
in
simple
fellowship
with
the
strange
saints
and
angels
through
all
the
middle
ages
the
marvellous
did
not
fail
from
the
earth
it
simply
receded
farther
from
the
centres
of
life
drawing
after
it
the
hearts
of
the
adventurous
the
polo
brothers
were
no
doubt
practical
men
while
they
drove
their
trade
in
venice
but
wonders
pressed
upon
them
when
they
set
foot
in
the
great
khan
s
domains
if
an
astute
italian
prince
who
lived
till
the
middle
of
the
fifteenth
century
with
the
light
of
the
new
humanism
flooding
his
court
could
yet
on
his
travels
to
the
holy
land
and
greece
discover
castles
inhabited
by
enchanted
snakes
as
well
as
shrines
of
his
own
creed
how
could
the
simple
hearts
of
the
anchorite
and
solitary
remain
closed
to
the
old
wonders
shapes
which
have
once
inhabited
the
imagination
of
man
pass
reluctantly
out
of
existence
centuries
of
poetic
belief
had
peopled
the
old
world
with
a
race
of
superhuman
beings
and
as
many
centuries
would
be
needed
to
lay
their
ghosts
it
must
be
remembered
moreover
that
no
sudden
cataclysm
political
or
intellectual
marked
the
introduction
of
the
christian
faith
for
three
centuries
after
the
sacrifice
on
calvary
hardly
an
allusion
to
the
new
god
is
to
be
found
in
the
pages
of
the
pagan
historians
and
philosophers
even
after
he
had
led
the
legions
of
constantine
to
victory
and
so
won
official
allegiance
throughout
the
roman
world
no
violent
change
marked
the
beginning
of
the
new
era
for
centuries
still
men
ploughed
the
same
fields
with
ploughs
fashioned
on
the
same
lines
kept
the
same
holidays
with
the
same
rites
and
lived
on
the
same
store
of
accumulated
beliefs
and
in
the
hearts
of
the
solitaries
these
beliefs
must
have
lingered
longest
for
in
fleeing
the
world
they
were
returning
to
the
native
habitations
of
the
old
gods
they
were
every
one
sprung
from
the
wave
the
cloud
the
tree
to
the
cities
they
had
been
borne
triumphant
by
the
will
of
men
and
from
the
cities
they
might
be
banished
at
its
behest
but
who
should
drive
them
from
their
old
stronghold
in
the
breast
of
nature
their
temples
might
be
to
the
new
god
but
none
could
banish
them
from
the
temples
not
made
with
hands
daylight
might
deny
them
but
twilight
confessed
them
still
they
made
no
effort
to
recover
the
supremacy
which
had
been
wrested
from
them
the
gods
know
when
their
hour
has
come
but
they
lived
on
shrinking
back
more
and
more
into
their
primitive
forms
into
the
vapour
the
the
on
the
lonely
sea
or
revealing
themselves
in
wistful
fugitive
glimpses
to
the
mortals
who
had
come
to
share
their
forest
exile
in
what
gentle
guise
they
showed
themselves
one
may
see
in
many
pictures
of
the
italian
some
of
whose
lesser
painters
seem
to
have
been
in
actual
communion
with
this
pale
woodland
olympus
the
gods
they
depict
are
not
the
shining
lords
of
the
greek
heaven
but
creatures
shy
suppliants
for
mortal
recognition
hovering
gently
on
the
verge
of
evanescence
robetta
the
florentine
engraver
transferred
them
to
some
of
his
plates
luini
caught
their
tender
grace
in
his
sacrifice
to
pan
and
metamorphosis
of
daphne
and
lorenzo
costa
gives
a
glimpse
of
their
sylvan
revels
in
the
mythological
scene
of
the
louvre
but
it
was
piero
di
cosimo
who
had
the
clearest
intuition
of
them
the
gentle
furred
creature
of
the
death
of
procris
might
have
been
the
very
faun
who
showed
saint
anthony
the
way
and
in
all
cosimo
s
mythological
pictures
one
has
the
same
impression
of
that
intermediate
world
the
twilight
world
of
the
conquered
christianized
yet
still
lingering
gods
so
different
from
the
clear
upper
air
of
classic
art
was
it
as
the
scholars
would
have
us
believe
mere
lack
of
and
technical
skill
that
kept
the
painters
of
the
cento
in
this
mediæval
olympus
were
these
vanishing
gods
and
merely
a
clumsy
attempt
to
formulate
the
classic
conception
of
divinity
but
the
pisani
had
discovered
greek
plastic
art
two
centuries
earlier
but
the
uncovered
wonders
of
rome
were
being
daily
drawn
and
measured
by
skilful
hands
but
the
silhouettes
of
the
antique
temples
were
still
outlined
against
the
skies
of
greater
greece
no
these
lesser
artists
were
not
struggling
to
embody
a
ideal
kept
nearer
the
soil
and
closer
to
the
past
by
the
very
limitations
of
their
genius
they
left
to
the
great
masters
the
task
of
reconstituting
classical
antiquity
content
to
go
on
painting
the
gods
who
still
lived
in
their
blood
the
gods
their
own
forbears
had
known
in
the
familiar
streets
and
fields
the
fading
gods
whom
the
hermits
were
last
to
see
in
the
lost
recesses
of
the
mountain
a
tuscan
shrine
one
of
the
rarest
and
most
delicate
pleasures
of
the
continental
tourist
is
to
circumvent
the
compiler
of
his
the
red
volumes
which
accompany
the
traveller
through
italy
have
so
completely
anticipated
the
most
whimsical
impulses
of
their
readers
that
it
is
now
almost
impossible
to
plan
a
tour
of
exploration
without
finding
on
reference
to
them
that
their
author
has
already
been
over
the
ground
has
tested
the
inns
measured
the
kilometres
and
distilled
from
the
massive
tomes
of
kugler
burckhardt
and
morelli
a
portable
estimate
of
the
local
art
and
architecture
even
the
discovery
of
incidental
lapses
scarcely
consoles
the
traveller
for
the
habitual
accuracy
of
his
statements
and
the
only
refuge
left
from
his
omniscience
lies
in
approaching
the
places
he
describes
by
a
route
which
he
has
not
taken
those
to
whom
one
of
the
greatest
charms
of
travel
in
countries
consists
in
such
momentary
escapes
from
the
expected
will
still
find
here
and
there
even
in
italy
a
few
miles
unmeasured
by
the
and
it
was
to
enjoy
the
brief
exhilaration
of
such
a
discovery
that
we
stepped
out
of
the
train
one
morning
at
certaldo
determined
to
find
our
way
thence
to
san
vivaldo
for
some
months
we
had
been
vaguely
aware
that
somewhere
among
the
hills
between
volterra
and
the
arno
there
lay
an
obscure
monastery
containing
a
series
of
groups
which
were
said
to
represent
the
scenes
of
the
passion
no
one
in
florence
seemed
to
know
much
about
them
and
many
of
the
people
whom
we
questioned
had
never
even
heard
of
san
vivaldo
professor
enrico
ridolfi
at
that
time
the
director
of
the
royal
museums
at
florence
knew
by
hearsay
of
the
existence
of
the
groups
and
told
me
that
there
was
every
reason
to
accept
the
local
tradition
which
has
always
attributed
them
to
giovanni
gonnelli
the
blind
modeller
of
gambassi
an
obscure
artist
of
the
seventeenth
century
much
praised
by
contemporary
authors
but
since
fallen
into
merited
oblivion
professor
ridolfi
however
had
never
seen
any
photographs
of
the
groups
and
was
not
unnaturally
disposed
to
believe
that
they
were
of
small
artistic
merit
since
gonnelli
worked
much
later
and
in
a
more
debased
period
of
taste
than
the
modeller
of
the
groups
at
varallo
still
even
when
the
more
pretentious
kind
of
italian
sculpture
was
at
its
lowest
a
spark
of
its
old
life
smouldered
here
and
there
in
the
improvisations
of
the
or
stucco
modeller
and
i
hoped
to
find
in
the
despised
groups
of
san
vivaldo
something
of
the
coarse
naïveté
and
brutal
energy
which
animate
their
more
famous
rivals
of
varallo
in
this
hope
we
started
in
search
of
san
vivaldo
and
as
the
told
us
that
it
could
be
reached
only
by
way
of
castel
fiorentino
we
promptly
determined
to
attack
it
from
san
gimignano
at
certaldo
the
birthplace
of
boccaccio
where
the
train
left
us
one
april
morning
we
found
an
archaic
little
carriage
with
a
coachman
who
entered
sympathetically
into
our
plan
for
eluding
our
cicerone
he
told
us
that
he
knew
a
road
which
led
in
about
four
hours
across
the
mountains
from
san
gimignano
to
san
vivaldo
and
in
his
charge
we
were
soon
crossing
the
elsa
and
climbing
the
steep
ascent
to
san
gimignano
where
we
were
to
spend
the
night
the
next
morning
before
sunrise
the
little
carriage
awaited
us
at
the
inn
door
and
as
we
dashed
out
under
the
gateway
of
san
gimignano
we
felt
the
thrill
of
explorers
sighting
a
new
continent
it
seemed
in
fact
an
unknown
world
which
lay
beneath
us
in
the
early
light
the
hills
so
definitely
etched
at
midday
at
sunset
so
softly
modelled
had
melted
into
a
silver
sea
of
which
the
farthest
waves
were
indistinguishably
merged
in
billows
of
luminous
mist
only
the
near
foreground
retained
its
precision
of
outline
and
that
too
had
assumed
an
air
of
unreality
fields
hedges
and
cypresses
were
tipped
with
an
aureate
brightness
which
recalled
the
golden
ripples
running
over
the
grass
in
the
foreground
of
botticelli
s
birth
of
the
sunshine
had
the
density
of
we
seemed
to
be
driving
through
the
landscape
of
a
missal
at
first
we
had
this
magical
world
to
ourselves
but
as
the
light
broadened
groups
of
labourers
began
to
appear
under
the
olives
and
between
the
vines
shepherdesses
distaff
in
hand
drove
their
flocks
along
the
roadside
and
yokes
of
white
oxen
with
scarlet
fringes
above
their
meditative
eyes
moved
past
us
with
such
solemn
deliberateness
of
step
that
fancy
transformed
their
carts
into
the
sacred
of
the
past
ahead
of
us
the
road
wound
through
a
district
of
vineyards
and
orchards
but
to
the
north
and
east
the
panorama
of
the
tuscan
hills
unrolled
range
after
range
of
treeless
undulations
outlined
one
upon
the
other
as
the
sun
grew
high
with
the
minuteness
of
a
mountain
background
of
sebald
beham
s
behind
us
the
fantastic
towers
of
san
gimignano
dominated
each
bend
of
the
road
like
some
persistent
mirage
of
the
desert
to
the
north
lay
castel
fiorentino
and
far
away
other
white
villages
gleamed
like
fossil
shells
embedded
in
the
the
elements
composing
the
foreground
of
such
tuscan
scenes
are
almost
always
extremely
simple
slopes
trellised
with
vine
and
mulberry
under
which
the
young
wheat
runs
like
green
flame
stretches
of
olive
orchard
and
here
and
there
a
with
projecting
eaves
and
open
loggia
guarded
by
its
inevitable
group
of
cypresses
these
cypresses
with
their
spires
of
rusty
black
acquire
an
extraordinary
value
against
the
breadth
of
the
landscape
distributed
with
the
sparing
hand
with
which
a
practised
writer
uses
his
they
seem
to
emphasize
the
more
intimate
meaning
of
the
scene
calling
the
eye
here
to
a
shrine
there
to
a
homestead
or
testifying
by
their
mere
presence
to
the
lost
tradition
of
some
barren
knoll
but
this
significance
of
detail
is
one
of
the
chief
charms
of
the
landscape
it
has
none
of
the
purposeless
prodigality
the
extravagant
climaxes
of
what
is
called
fine
scenery
nowhere
is
there
any
obvious
largesse
to
the
eye
but
the
very
reticence
of
its
lines
its
seeming
disdain
of
facile
effects
almost
give
it
the
quality
of
a
work
of
art
make
it
appear
the
crowning
production
of
centuries
of
plastic
expression
for
some
distance
the
road
from
san
gimignano
to
san
vivaldo
winds
continuously
upward
and
our
ascent
at
length
brought
us
to
a
region
where
agriculture
ceases
and
the
way
lies
across
heathery
undulations
with
a
scant
growth
of
oaks
and
ilexes
in
the
more
sheltered
hollows
as
we
drove
on
these
copses
gave
way
to
and
presently
we
dipped
over
the
yoke
of
the
highest
ridge
and
saw
below
us
another
sea
of
hills
with
a
bare
rising
from
it
like
a
scaly
monster
floating
on
the
waves
its
savage
spine
bristling
with
the
walls
and
towers
of
volterra
for
nearly
an
hour
we
skirted
the
edge
of
this
basin
of
hills
in
sight
of
the
ancient
city
on
its
livid
cliff
then
we
turned
into
a
gentler
country
through
woods
starred
with
primroses
with
a
flash
of
streams
in
the
hollows
and
presently
a
murmur
of
reached
us
through
the
woodland
silence
at
the
same
moment
we
caught
sight
of
a
brick
campanile
rising
above
the
trees
on
a
slope
just
ahead
of
us
and
our
carriage
turned
from
the
up
a
lane
with
scattered
chapels
showing
their
white
façades
through
the
foliage
this
lane
making
a
sudden
twist
descended
abruptly
between
mossy
banks
and
brought
us
out
on
a
before
a
rectangular
monastic
building
adjoining
the
church
of
which
the
bells
had
welcomed
us
here
was
san
vivaldo
and
the
chapels
we
had
passed
doubtless
concealed
beneath
their
cupolas
more
neat
than
solemn
the
of
which
we
were
in
search
the
monastery
of
san
vivaldo
at
one
time
secularized
by
the
italian
government
has
now
been
restored
to
the
franciscan
order
of
which
its
patron
saint
was
a
member
san
vivaldo
was
born
at
san
gimignano
in
the
latter
half
of
the
thirteenth
century
and
after
joining
in
his
youth
the
tertiary
order
of
saint
francis
retired
to
a
hollow
in
the
forest
of
camporeno
the
site
of
the
present
monastery
in
which
cramped
abode
he
passed
the
remainder
of
his
life
in
continual
macerations
and
after
his
death
the
tree
which
had
been
sanctified
in
so
unusual
a
manner
became
an
object
of
devotion
among
the
neighbouring
peasantry
who
when
it
disappeared
raised
on
the
spot
an
oratory
to
the
virgin
it
is
doubtful
however
if
this
memorial
which
fell
gradually
into
neglect
would
have
preserved
san
vivaldo
from
oblivion
had
not
that
senancour
of
a
saint
found
a
matthew
arnold
in
the
shape
of
a
franciscan
friar
a
certain
fra
cherubino
of
florence
who
early
in
the
sixteenth
century
was
commissioned
by
his
order
to
watch
over
and
restore
the
abandoned
sanctuary
fra
cherubino
with
his
companions
took
possession
of
the
forest
of
camporeno
and
proceeded
to
lay
the
of
a
monastery
which
was
to
commemorate
the
hermit
of
the
the
forgotten
merits
of
san
vivaldo
were
speedily
restored
to
popular
favour
by
the
friar
s
eloquence
and
often
after
one
of
his
sermons
three
thousand
people
were
to
be
seen
marching
in
procession
to
the
river
evola
to
fetch
for
the
monastery
meanwhile
fra
tommaso
another
of
the
monks
struck
by
the
resemblance
of
the
hills
and
valleys
of
camporeno
to
the
holy
places
of
palestine
began
the
erection
of
the
devout
chapels
which
were
to
contain
the
representations
of
the
passion
and
thus
arose
the
group
of
buildings
now
forming
the
monastery
of
san
vivaldo
as
we
drove
up
we
saw
several
monks
at
work
in
the
woods
and
in
the
below
the
monastery
these
took
no
notice
of
us
but
in
answer
to
our
coachman
s
summons
there
appeared
another
whose
roman
profile
might
have
emerged
from
one
of
those
great
of
the
sixteenth
century
where
monks
and
chaplains
are
gathered
about
a
seated
pope
this
monk
whose
courteous
welcome
betrayed
as
little
surprise
as
though
the
lonely
glades
of
san
vivaldo
were
daily
invaded
by
hordes
of
informed
us
that
it
was
his
duty
to
conduct
visitors
to
the
various
shrines
the
chapels
of
the
passion
are
about
twenty
in
number
and
as
many
more
are
said
to
have
perished
they
are
scattered
irregularly
through
the
wood
adjoining
the
monastery
and
our
guide
who
showed
a
deep
interest
in
the
works
of
art
committed
to
his
charge
assured
us
that
the
groups
were
undoubtedly
due
to
giovanni
gonnelli
cieco
di
for
whose
talent
he
seemed
to
entertain
a
profound
admiration
some
of
the
master
s
work
he
added
had
been
destroyed
or
replaced
by
that
of
qualche
muratore
but
he
assured
us
that
in
the
groups
which
had
been
preserved
we
should
at
once
recognize
the
touch
of
an
eminent
hand
as
he
led
the
way
he
smilingly
referred
to
giovanni
gonnelli
s
legendary
blindness
which
plays
a
most
picturesque
part
in
the
artist
s
biography
the
monk
explained
to
us
that
gonnelli
was
blind
of
only
one
eye
thus
demolishing
baldinucci
s
charming
tradition
of
executed
in
total
darkness
to
the
amazement
of
popes
and
princes
still
we
suspected
our
guide
of
adapting
his
hero
s
exploits
to
the
incredulity
of
the
unorthodox
and
perhaps
secretly
believing
in
the
anecdotes
over
which
he
affected
to
smile
on
the
threshold
of
the
first
chapel
he
paused
to
explain
that
some
of
the
groups
had
been
irreparably
injured
during
the
period
of
neglect
and
abandonment
which
followed
the
suppression
of
the
monastery
the
government
he
added
had
seized
the
opportunity
to
carry
off
from
the
church
the
presepio
in
high
relief
which
was
gonnelli
s
masterpiece
and
to
strip
many
of
the
chapels
of
the
escutcheons
in
robbia
ware
that
formerly
ornamented
the
ceilings
even
then
however
he
concluded
our
good
fathers
were
keeping
secret
watch
over
the
shrines
and
they
saved
some
of
the
escutcheons
by
covering
them
with
whitewash
but
the
government
has
never
given
us
back
our
having
thus
guarded
us
against
possible
disillusionment
he
unlocked
the
door
of
the
first
chapel
on
what
he
declared
to
be
an
undoubted
work
of
the
master
the
descent
of
the
holy
ghost
upon
the
disciples
this
group
like
all
the
others
at
san
vivaldo
is
set
in
a
little
apsidal
recess
at
the
farther
end
of
the
chapel
i
had
expected
at
best
an
inferior
imitation
of
the
groups
in
the
more
famous
via
crucis
of
varallo
but
to
my
surprise
i
found
myself
in
the
presence
of
a
much
finer
and
apparently
a
much
earlier
work
the
figures
which
are
of
are
set
in
a
depressed
arch
and
fitted
into
their
allotted
space
with
something
of
the
skill
which
the
greek
sculptors
showed
in
adapting
their
groups
to
the
slope
of
the
pediment
in
the
centre
the
virgin
kneels
on
a
low
column
or
pedestal
which
raises
her
partially
above
the
surrounding
figures
of
the
disciples
her
attitude
is
solemnly
prayerful
with
a
touch
of
severity
in
the
folds
of
the
wimple
and
in
the
gathered
plaits
of
the
gown
beneath
her
cloak
her
face
furrowed
with
lines
of
grief
and
age
is
yet
irradiated
by
an
inner
light
and
her
hands
like
those
of
all
the
figures
hitherto
attributed
to
gonnelli
are
singularly
graceful
and
expressive
the
same
air
of
unction
of
what
the
french
call
distinguishes
the
face
and
attitude
of
the
kneeling
disciple
on
the
extreme
left
and
the
whole
group
breathes
that
air
of
devotional
simplicity
usually
associated
with
an
earlier
and
less
worldly
period
of
art
next
to
this
group
the
finest
is
perhaps
that
of
lo
spasimo
the
swoon
of
the
virgin
at
the
sight
of
christ
bearing
the
cross
it
is
the
smallest
of
the
groups
being
less
than
and
comprising
only
the
figure
of
the
virgin
supported
by
the
marys
and
by
two
kneeling
angels
there
is
a
trace
of
primitive
stiffness
in
the
attempt
to
render
the
prostration
of
the
virgin
but
her
face
expresses
an
extremity
of
speechless
anguish
which
is
subtly
contrasted
with
the
awed
but
temperate
grief
of
the
woman
who
bends
above
her
while
the
lovely
countenances
of
the
attendant
angels
convey
another
shade
of
tender
participation
the
compassion
of
those
who
are
in
the
counsels
of
the
eternal
and
know
that
la
sua
volontade
è
nostra
in
this
group
the
artist
has
attained
to
the
completest
expression
of
his
characteristic
qualities
refined
and
careful
modelling
reticence
of
emotion
and
that
gift
of
tears
which
is
the
last
attribute
one
would
seek
in
the
resonant
but
superficial
art
of
the
seventeenth
century
among
other
groups
undoubtedly
due
to
the
same
hand
are
those
of
christ
before
pilate
of
the
ascension
and
of
the
magdalen
bathing
the
feet
of
christ
in
the
group
of
the
ascension
the
upper
part
has
been
grotesquely
restored
but
the
figures
of
the
virgin
and
disciples
who
kneel
below
are
apparently
untouched
and
on
their
faces
is
seen
that
look
of
wondering
ecstasy
that
reflection
of
the
beatific
vision
which
the
artist
excelled
in
representing
in
every
group
of
the
series
his
saint
john
has
this
luminous
look
and
in
that
of
the
ascension
it
brightens
even
the
shrewd
bearded
countenances
of
the
older
disciples
in
the
scene
of
christ
before
pilate
the
figure
of
pilate
is
especially
noteworthy
his
delicate
incredulous
lips
seem
just
framing
their
immortal
interrogation
our
guide
pointed
out
that
the
roman
lictor
in
this
group
who
raises
his
arm
to
strike
the
accused
christ
has
had
his
offending
hand
knocked
off
by
the
zeal
of
the
faithful
the
representation
of
the
magdalen
bathing
the
feet
of
christ
is
noticeable
for
the
fine
assemblage
of
heads
about
the
those
of
christ
and
of
his
host
are
peculiarly
expressive
and
saint
john
s
look
of
tranquil
tenderness
contrasts
almost
girlishly
with
the
majestic
gravity
of
the
neighbouring
faces
the
magdalen
herself
is
less
happily
executed
there
is
something
actually
unpleasant
in
her
ramping
attitude
as
she
crawls
toward
the
christ
and
the
figure
is
probably
by
another
hand
in
the
group
of
the
crucifixion
for
the
most
part
of
inferior
workmanship
the
figures
of
the
two
thieves
are
finely
modelled
and
their
expression
of
anguish
has
been
achieved
with
the
same
sobriety
of
means
which
marks
all
the
artist
s
effects
the
remaining
groups
in
the
chapels
are
without
special
interest
but
under
the
portico
of
the
church
there
are
three
fine
figures
possibly
by
the
artist
of
the
spasimo
representing
saint
roch
saint
linus
of
volterra
and
one
of
the
fathers
of
the
church
there
are
then
among
the
groups
of
san
vivaldo
five
which
appear
to
be
by
the
same
master
in
addition
to
several
scattered
figures
presumably
by
his
hand
all
of
which
have
always
been
attributed
to
giovanni
gonnelli
the
blind
pupil
of
pietro
tacca
the
figures
in
these
groups
are
nearly
if
not
quite
as
large
as
life
they
have
all
been
rudely
repainted
and
are
entirely
unglazed
though
framed
in
glazed
mouldings
of
the
familiar
robbian
style
professor
ridolfi
s
information
was
confirmed
by
the
local
tradition
and
there
seemed
no
doubt
that
the
groups
of
san
vivaldo
had
always
been
regarded
as
the
work
of
gonnelli
an
obscure
artist
living
at
a
time
when
the
greatest
masters
produced
little
to
which
posterity
has
conceded
any
artistic
excellence
but
one
glance
at
the
sufficed
to
show
that
they
could
not
have
been
modelled
in
century
neither
their
merits
nor
their
defects
belonged
to
that
period
of
art
what
had
the
sculptor
of
san
vivaldo
in
common
with
the
pupils
of
giovanni
bologna
and
il
fiammingo
that
tribe
of
skilled
craftsmen
who
peopled
every
church
and
palace
in
italy
with
an
impersonal
flock
of
junos
and
virgin
marys
venuses
and
magdalens
distinguishable
only
by
their
official
attributes
the
more
closely
i
studied
the
groups
the
more
the
conviction
grew
that
they
were
the
work
of
an
artist
trained
in
an
earlier
tradition
and
still
preserving
under
the
stiffening
influences
of
convention
a
touch
of
that
individuality
and
directness
of
expression
which
mark
the
prime
of
tuscan
art
the
careful
modelling
of
the
hands
the
quiet
grouping
so
free
from
effort
and
agitation
the
simple
draperies
the
devotional
expression
of
the
faces
all
seemed
to
point
to
the
lingering
influences
of
the
fifteenth
century
not
indeed
to
the
fresh
charm
of
its
noon
but
to
the
refinement
the
severity
of
its
close
the
glazed
mouldings
enclosing
the
groups
and
the
coloured
medallions
with
which
the
ceilings
of
the
chapels
are
decorated
suggested
a
direct
connection
with
the
later
school
of
the
robbias
and
as
i
looked
i
was
haunted
by
a
confused
recollection
of
a
presepio
seen
at
the
bargello
and
attributed
to
giovanni
della
robbia
or
his
school
could
this
be
the
which
had
been
removed
from
san
vivaldo
on
returning
to
florence
i
went
at
once
to
the
bargello
and
found
as
i
had
expected
that
the
presepio
i
had
in
mind
was
indeed
the
one
from
san
vivaldo
i
was
surprised
by
the
extraordinary
resemblance
of
the
heads
to
some
of
those
in
the
groups
ascribed
to
gonnelli
i
had
fancied
that
the
modeller
of
san
vivaldo
might
have
been
inspired
by
the
presepio
of
the
bargello
but
i
was
unprepared
for
the
identity
of
treatment
in
certain
details
of
hair
and
drapery
and
for
the
recurrence
of
the
same
type
of
face
the
presepio
undoubtedly
shows
greater
delicacy
of
treatment
but
this
is
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
the
figures
are
much
smaller
and
only
in
partial
relief
whereas
at
san
vivaldo
they
are
so
much
detached
from
the
background
that
they
may
be
regarded
as
groups
of
statuary
again
the
glaze
which
covers
all
but
the
faces
of
the
presepio
has
preserved
its
original
beauty
of
colouring
while
the
groups
of
san
vivaldo
have
been
crudely
daubed
with
fresh
coats
of
paint
and
even
of
whitewash
and
the
effect
of
the
presepio
is
farther
enhanced
by
an
excessively
ornate
frame
of
pilasters
as
well
as
by
its
charming
predella
with
small
scenes
set
between
panels
of
arabesque
altogether
it
is
a
far
more
elaborate
production
than
the
of
san
vivaldo
and
some
of
its
most
graceful
details
such
as
the
dance
of
angels
on
the
are
evidently
borrowed
from
the
earlier
of
the
robbias
but
in
spite
of
these
incidental
archaisms
no
one
can
fail
to
be
struck
by
the
likeness
of
the
central
figures
to
certain
of
the
statues
at
san
vivaldo
the
head
of
saint
joseph
in
the
presepio
for
instance
with
its
wrinkled
penthouse
forehead
and
the
curled
and
parted
beard
suggests
at
once
that
of
the
disciple
seated
on
the
right
of
saint
john
in
the
house
of
the
pharisee
the
same
face
though
younger
occurs
again
in
the
pentecostal
group
and
the
kneeling
female
figure
in
the
presepio
is
treated
in
the
same
manner
as
the
youngest
mary
in
the
group
of
the
spasimo
even
the
long
tresses
with
their
convolutions
are
the
same
the
discovery
of
this
close
resemblance
deepened
the
interest
of
the
problem
it
seemed
hardly
credible
that
a
work
of
such
artistic
significance
as
the
via
crucis
of
san
vivaldo
should
not
long
since
have
been
studied
and
classified
in
tuscany
especially
where
every
phase
of
art
including
its
prolongation
in
the
succeeding
century
has
been
traced
and
analyzed
with
such
scrupulous
care
it
was
inconceivable
that
so
interesting
an
example
of
an
essentially
italian
style
should
have
escaped
notice
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
groups
belonged
to
the
period
in
question
since
it
was
impossible
not
to
reject
at
once
the
hypothetical
artist
content
to
imitate
with
servile
accuracy
a
manner
which
had
already
fallen
into
disfavour
it
was
necessary
to
assume
that
a
remarkable
example
of
late
art
had
remained
undiscovered
within
a
few
hours
journey
from
florence
for
nearly
four
hundred
years
the
only
reasonable
explanation
of
this
oversight
seemed
to
be
that
owing
to
the
seclusion
of
the
monastery
of
san
vivaldo
the
groups
had
never
acquired
more
than
local
fame
and
that
having
possibly
been
restored
in
the
seventeenth
century
by
giovanni
gonnelli
or
one
of
his
pupils
they
had
been
ascribed
to
him
by
a
generation
which
having
ceased
to
value
the
work
of
the
earlier
artist
was
profoundly
impressed
by
the
miraculous
skill
of
the
blind
modeller
and
eager
to
connect
his
name
with
the
artistic
treasures
of
the
monastery
to
the
infrequent
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
there
would
be
nothing
surprising
in
such
an
attribution
the
perception
of
differences
in
style
is
a
faculty
and
even
if
a
student
of
art
had
penetrated
to
the
wilds
of
san
vivaldo
he
would
probably
have
noticed
nothing
to
arouse
a
doubt
of
the
local
tradition
the
movement
toward
a
discrimination
of
styles
which
came
in
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
was
marked
in
the
study
of
italian
art
by
a
contemptuous
indifference
toward
all
but
a
brief
period
of
that
art
and
the
mere
fact
that
a
piece
of
sculpture
was
said
to
have
been
executed
in
the
seventeenth
century
would
until
very
lately
have
sufficed
to
prevent
its
receiving
expert
attention
thus
the
tradition
which
ascribed
the
groups
of
san
vivaldo
to
giovanni
gonnelli
resulted
in
concealing
them
from
modern
investigation
as
effectually
as
though
they
had
been
situated
in
the
centre
of
an
unexplored
continent
and
in
procuring
for
me
the
rare
sensation
of
an
artistic
discovery
made
in
the
heart
of
the
most
artistic
of
europe
my
first
care
was
to
seek
expert
confirmation
of
my
theory
and
as
a
step
in
this
direction
i
made
arrangements
to
have
the
groups
of
san
vivaldo
photographed
by
signor
alinari
of
florence
i
was
obliged
to
leave
italy
before
the
photographs
could
be
taken
but
on
receiving
them
i
sent
them
at
once
to
professor
ridolfi
who
had
listened
with
some
natural
incredulity
to
my
description
of
the
and
his
reply
shows
that
i
had
not
overestimated
the
importance
of
the
discovery
no
sooner
he
writes
had
i
seen
the
photographs
than
i
became
convinced
of
the
error
of
attributing
them
to
giovanni
gonnelli
called
cieco
di
i
saw
at
once
that
they
are
not
the
work
of
an
artist
of
the
seventeenth
century
but
of
one
living
at
the
close
of
the
fifteenth
or
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
of
an
artist
of
the
school
of
the
robbias
who
follows
their
precepts
and
possesses
their
style
the
figures
are
most
beautifully
grouped
and
modelled
with
profound
sentiment
and
not
a
little
they
do
not
appear
to
me
to
be
all
by
the
same
author
for
the
christ
in
the
house
of
the
pharisee
seems
earlier
and
purer
in
style
and
more
robust
in
manner
also
the
swoon
of
the
madonna
which
is
executed
in
a
grander
style
than
the
other
reliefs
and
seems
to
belong
to
the
first
years
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
fact
that
these
are
not
glazed
does
not
prove
that
they
are
not
the
work
of
the
robbia
school
for
giovanni
della
robbia
for
example
sometimes
left
the
flesh
of
his
figures
unglazed
painting
them
with
the
brush
and
this
is
precisely
the
case
in
a
presepio
of
the
national
museum
this
is
the
presepio
of
san
vivaldo
a
work
of
the
robbias
in
which
the
flesh
is
left
unglazed
i
therefore
declare
with
absolute
certainty
that
it
is
a
mistake
to
attribute
these
beautiful
works
to
giovanni
gonnelli
and
that
they
are
undoubtedly
a
century
earlier
in
sub
umbra
liliorum
an
impression
of
parma
parma
at
first
sight
lacks
the

investigations
to
the

satisfaction
for

tastes
the
general
aspect
of
parma
is
in
fact
distinctly
inexpressive
and
its
more
important
buildings
have
only
the
relative
merit
of
suggesting
happier
examples
of
the
same
style
this
absence
of
the
superlative
is
in
many
italian
cities
atoned
for
by
the
episodical
charm
of
the
streets
by
glimpses
of
sculptured
windows
pillared
and
cornices
projecting
a
perfect
curve
against
the
blue
but
the
houses
of
parma
are
plain
almost
to
meanness
and
though
their
monotonous
succession
is
broken
here
and
there
by
a
embroidered
with
the
farnese
lilies
it
must
be
owned
that
with
rare
exceptions
these
façades
have
few
palatial
qualities
but
that
of
size
perhaps
not
short
of
ravenna
could
be
found
another
italian
town
as
destitute
of
the
more
obvious
graces
and
nowhere
surely
but
in
italy
could
so
unpromising
an
exterior
hide
such
varied
treasures
to
the
lover
of
italy
the
perennial
wooer
whom
every
spring
recalls
across
the
alps
there
is
a
certain
charm
in
this
external
dulness
after
being
steeped
in
the
mediævalism
of
siena
perugia
or
pistoja
after
breathing
at
vicenza
modena
and
bergamo
the
very
air
of
goldoni
rosalba
and
the
dell
it
is
refreshing
to
come
on
a
town
that
holds
back
and
says

me
such
a
challenge
puts
the
psychologist
on
his
mettle
and
gives
to
his
quest
the
stimulus
of
discovery
it
may
seem
paradoxical
to
connect
the
emotions
of
the
explorer
with
one
of
the
most
familiar
centres
of
artistic
influence
but
it
is
partly
because
parma
is
still
dominated
by
correggio
that
it
has
dropped
out
of
the
emotional
range
of
the
modern
traveller
for
though
it
is
scarce
a
hundred
years
since
our
grandparents
posted
thither
to
palpitate
over
the
master
their
æsthetic
point
of
view
is
as
remote
from
ours
as
their
mode
of
locomotion
by
a
curious
perversity
of
fate
correggio
so
long
regarded
as
the
leading
exponent
of
sentiment
now
survives
only
by
virtue
of
his
technique
and
has
shrunk
to
the
limited
immortality
of
the
painter
s
painter
a
new
generation
may
rediscover
his
emotional
charm
but
to
the
untechnical
of
the
present
day
his
prodigious
manipulations
of
light
and
colour
seldom
atone
for
the
turveydrop
attitudes
of
his
saints
and
angels
and
for
the
sugary
loveliness
of
his
madonnas
lacking
alike
the
frank
naturalism
of
such
masters
as
palma
vecchio
and
bonifazio
the
sensuous
mysticism
of
sodoma
and
the
fantastic
gaiety
of
tiepolo
correggio
seems
to
typify
that
phase
of
cold
sentimentality
which
dwindled
to
its
end
in
the
keepsakes
of
sixty
years
ago
each
generation
makes
certain
demands
on
the
art
of
its
own
period
and
seeks
certain
affinities
in
the
art
of
the
past
and
a
kind
of
personal
sincerity
is
perhaps
what
modern
taste
has
most
consistently
exacted
the
term
being
understood
not
in
its
technical
sense
as
applied
to
execution
but
in
its
imaginative
significance
as
qualifying
the
message
of
the
artist
it
is
inevitable
that
the
average
spectator
should
look
at
pictures
from
a
quite
untechnical
standpoint
he
knows
nothing
of
values
brushwork
and
the
rest
yet
it
is
to
the
immense
majority
formed
by
his
kind
that
art
addresses
itself
there
must
therefore
be
two
recognized
ways
of
judging
a
picture
by
its
technique
and
by
its
expression
that
is
not
the
mere
story
it
has
to
tell
but
its
power
of
rendering
in
line
and
colour
the
equivalent
of
some
idea
or
of
some
emotion
there
is
the
less
reason
for
disputing
such
a
claim
because
given
the
power
of
as
this
faculty
may
be
defined
the
power
of
embodying
the
impression
of
making
it
visible
and
comprehensible
to
others
is
necessarily
one
of
technique
and
it
is
doubtful
if
any
artist
not
possessed
of
this
insight
has
received
even
from
his
a
lasting
award
of
supremacy
now
the
sentiment
that
correggio
embodied
is
one
which
from
the
present
point
of
view
seems
to
lack
the
preserving
essence
of
sincerity
it
is
true
that
recent
taste
has
returned
with
a
certain
passion
to
the
brilliant
mannerisms
of
the
eighteenth
century
but
it
is
because
they
are
voluntary
mannerisms
as
frankly
factitious
as
the
masquerading
of
children
that
they
have
retained
their
hold
on
the
fancy
as
there
is
a
soul
in
the
games
of
children
or
in
any
diversion
entered
into
with
conviction
so
there
is
a
soul
if
only
an
inconsequent
spoiled
child
s
soul
in
the
laughing
art
of
the
eighteenth
century
it
is
the
defect
of
correggio
s
art
that
it
expresses
no
conviction
whatever
he
offers
us
no
clue
to
the
d
of
his
celestial
gymnasts
they
do
not
seem
to
be
honestly
in
love
with
this
world
or
the
next
or
to
take
any
personal
part
in
the
transactions
in
which
the
artist
has
engaged
them
in
fact
they
are
simply
models
smirking
and
attitudinizing
at
so
much
an
hour
and
so
well
trained
that
even
their
individuality
as
models
remains
hidden
behind
the
fixed
professional
smile
the
conclusion
is
that
if
they
are
only
models
to
the
spectator
it
is
because
they
were
only
models
to
correggio
that
his
art
had
no
transmuting
quality
and
that
he
was
always
conscious
of
the
wires
which
held
on
the
wings
it
may
indeed
be
argued
that
devotional
painting
in
italy
had
assumed
in
the
sixteenth
century
a
stereotyped
form
from
which
a
stronger
genius
than
correggio
s
could
hardly
have
freed
it
and
that
the
triumphs
of
that
day
should
be
sought
rather
in
the
domain
of
decorative
art
where
conventionality
becomes
a
strength
and
where
the
æsthetic
imagination
finds
expression
in
combinations
of
mere
line
and
colour
many
of
the
decorative
paintings
of
the
sixteenth
century
are
indeed
among
the
most
delightful
products
of
italian
art
and
it
might
have
been
expected
that
correggio
s
extraordinary
technical
skill
and
love
of
rhythmically
whirling
lines
would
have
found
complete
development
in
this
direction
it
is
of
course
permissible
to
the
artist
to
regard
the
heavenly
hosts
as
mere
factors
in
a
decorative
composition
and
to
consider
thrones
dominations
princedoms
virtues
powers
only
in
their
relation
to
the
diameter
of
a
dome
or
to
the
curve
of
a
spandril
but
to
the
untechnical
spectator
such
a
feat
is
almost
impossible
and
in
judging
a
painter
simply
as
a
decorator
the
public
is
more
at
its
ease
before
such
frankly
ornamental
works
as
the
famous
frescoes
of
the
convent
of
saint
paul
it
might
in
fact
have
been
expected
that
correggio
would
be
at
his
best
in
executing
the
commission
of
the
abbess
who
had
charged
him
to
amplify
the
symbolism
of
her
device
the
crescent
moon
by
adorning
her
apartments
with
the
legend
of
diana
there
is
something
delightfully
characteristic
of
the
period
in
this
choice
of
the
latmian
goddess
to
typify
the
spirit
of
monastic
chastity
and
equally
characteristic
is
correggio
s
acceptance
of
the
commission
as
an
opportunity
to
paint
classic
and
rosy
flesh
and
blood
without
much
attempt
to
express
the
somewhat
strained
symbolism
of
the

with

in

lacking
as
a
whole
just
that
ethereal
quality
which
is
supposed
to
be
the
distinctive
mark
of

heavy
and

uniform
and
the
too
fat

stolid
for
their

task
this
failure
of
the
decorative
sense
is
rendered
more
noticeable
by
the
happy
manner
in
which
araldi
a
generation
earlier
had
solved

similar

the
light

biblical
and

are
presented
with
all
that
earnest
striving
after
personal
truth
of
expression
that
is
the
ruling
principle
of
art
it
is
this
faculty
of
personal
interpretation
always
kept
in
strict
abeyance
to
the
laws

the
later
in

save
perhaps
the

to
fall
a
little
short
of
perfection
of
a
much
earlier
style
of
mural
painting
parma
itself
contains
one
notable
example
the
ancient
octagon
of
the
baptistery
with
its
encircling
arcade
and
strange
frieze
of
leaping
ramping
and
running
animals
is
outwardly
one
of
the
most
interesting
buildings
in
italy
while
its
interior
has
a
character
of
its
own
hardly
to
be
matched
even
in
that
land
of
fiercely
competing
individualism
downward
from
the
apex
of
the
dome
the
walls
are
frescoed
in
successive
tiers
with
figures
of
saints
in
rigid
staring
attitudes
interspersed
with
awkward
presentments
of
biblical
story
all
these
designs
are
marked
by
a
peculiar
naïveté
of
composition
and
great
vehemence
of
gesture
and
expression
those
in
the
dome
and
between
the
windows
are
attributed
to
the
thirteenth
century
while
the
lower
frescoes
are
of
the
fourteenth
but
so
crude
in
execution
are
the
latter
that
they
combine
with
the
upper
rows
in
producing
an
effect
of
exceptional
decorative
value
to
which
a
note
of
strangeness
is
given
by
the
introduction
here
and
there
of
of
saints
and
angels
so
placed
that
the
frescoes
form
a
background
to
their
projecting
figures
the
most
successful
of
these
sculptures
is
the
relief
of
the
flight
into
egypt

solemn
procession
led
by
a
squat
angel
with
unwieldy
wings
and
closed
by
two
figures
in
oriental
dress
seen
after
the
baptistery
the
cathedral
is
perhaps
something
of
a
disappointment
yet
to
pass
from
its
front
between
the
worn
red
lions
of
the
ancient
porch
into
the
dusky
magnificence
of
the
interior
is
to
enjoy
one
of
those
contrasts
possible
only
in

land

may
disclose

to
which
time
has
given
a
tone
as
of
sumptuous
hangings
that
atones
for
the
pretentious
insignificance
of
their
design

is
a
venerable
episcopal
throne
attributed
to

strangely
dramatic
sculptor

the

ascribed

above
the
arch
of
the
proscenium
still
serve
to
recall
the
original
splendour
of
the
scene
the
dusty
gloom
of
the
place
suggests
some
impending
transformation
and
when
fancy
has
restored
to
the
roof
the
great
glass
chandeliers
now
hanging
in
the
neighbouring
museum
their
light
seems
to
fall
once
more
on
boxes
draped
with
crimson
velvet
and
filled
with
lords
and
ladies
in
the
sumptuous
spanish
habit
while
on
the
stage
before
a
gay
perspective
of
colonnades
and
terraces
isabel
and
harlequin
and
the
capitan
spavento
of
another
sort
build
on
the
scaffolding
of
some
familiar
intrigue
the
airy
superstructure
of
their
wit
in
the
adjoining
palace
no
such
revival
is
possible
most
museums
in
italy
are
dead
palaces
and
none
is
more
inanimate
than
that
of
parma
many
of
the
ducal
treasures
are
still
left
family
portraits
by
suttermans
and
sir
antony
mor
busts
of
the
bourbon
dukes
of
parma
with
voluminous
wigs
and
fluttering
steinkerks
old
furniture
old
majolica
and
all
those
frail
elaborate
trifles
that
the
irony
of
fate
preserves
when
brick
and
marble
crumble
all
these
accessories
of
a
ruined
splendour
catalogued
numbered
and
penned
up
in
glass
cases
can
no
more
revive
the
life
of
which
they
formed
a
part
than
the
contents
of
an
herbarium
can
renew
the
scent
and
murmur
of
a
summer
meadow
the
transient
holders
of
all
that
pomp
from
the
great
alexander
to
the
duchess
marie
louise
of
austria
his
last
unworthy
successor
look
down
with
unrecognizing
eyes
on
this
dry
alignment
of
classified
objects
and
one
feels
in
passing
from
one
room
to
another
as
though
some
fanciful
heroic
poem
depicting
the
splendid
vanities
of
life
and
depending
for
its
effect
on
a
fortunate
collocation
of
words
had
been
broken
up
and
sorted
out
into
the
different
parts
of
speech
this
is
the
view
of
the
sentimentalist
but
from
that
of
the
student
of
art
the
museum
of
parma
is
perhaps
more
interesting
than
the
palace
could
ever
have
been
the
correggios
are
in
themselves
an
unmatched
possession
the
general
collection
of
pictures
is
large
and
varied
and
the
wealth
of
bronzes
and
marbles
of
coins
medals
and
architectural
fragments
of
different
schools
and
periods
would
be
remarkable
in
any
country
but
italy
where
the
inexhaustible
richness
of
the
small
towns
is
a
surprise
to
the
most
experienced
traveller
on
the
whole
the
impression
carried
away
from
parma
is
incomplete
and
confusing
the
name
calls
forth
as
many
scattered
images
as
contradictory
associations
it
is
doubtful
if
the
wanderer
reviewing
from
a
distance
his
italian
memories
will
be
able
to
put
any
distinct
picture
of
the
place
beside
the
concrete
vision
of
siena
mantua
or
vicenza
it
will
not
hang
as
a
whole
in
the
gallery
of
his
mental
vignettes
but
in
the
mosaic
of
detached
impressions
some
rich
and
iridescent
fragments
will
represent
his
of
parma
march
in
italy
i
march
is
in
some
respects
the
most
exquisite
month
of
the
italian
year
it
is
the
month
of
transitions
and
surprises
of
vehement
circling
showers
with
a
golden
heart
of
sunlight
of
bare
fields
suffused
overnight
with
and
hedgerows
budding
as
suddenly
as
the
staff
of
tannhäuser
it
is
the
month
in
which
the
northern
traveller
grown
distrustful
of
the
promised
clemency
of
italian
skies
and
with
the
winter
bitterness
still
in
his
bones
lighting
on
a
patch
of
primroses
under
a
leafless
bank
or
on
the
running
flame
of
tulips
along
the
trenches
of
an
olive
orchard
learns
that
italy
italy
after
all
and
hugs
himself
at
thought
of
the
black
ultramontane
march
it
must
be
owned
however
that
it
is
not
even
in
italy
the
safest
month
for
excursions
there
are
too
many
toward
winter
too
many
moody
hesitating
dawns
when
the
skies
will
not
declare
themselves
for
or
against
rain
but
hanging
neutral
till
the
hesitating
traveller
sets
forth
seem
then
to
take
a
cruel
joy
in
proving
that
he
should
have
stayed
at
home
yet
there
are
rare
years
when
some
benign
influence
tames
the
fitfulness
of
march
subduing
her
to
a
long
sequence
of
golden
days
and
then
he
who
has
trusted
to
her
promise
receives
the
most
exquisite
reward
it
takes
faith
in
one
s
luck
to
catch
step
with
such
a
train
of
days
and
fare
with
them
northward
across
the
wakening
land
but
now
and
then
this
fortune
befalls
the
pilgrim
and
then
he
sees
a
new
italy
an
italy
which
discovery
seems
to
make
his
own
the
ancient
latin
landscape
so
and
lies
virgin
to
the
eye
in
floods
of
limpid
air
the
scene
seems
recreated
by
the
imagination
it
wears
the
pristine
sparkle
of
those
of
fables
immortal
fashioned
from
mortal
which
lie
beyond
the
geographer
s
boundaries
like
the
oceanus
of
the
early
charts
it
becomes
in
short
the
land
in
which
anything
may
happen
save
the
dull
the
obvious
and
the
expected
ii
it
was
for
instance
on
such
a
march
day
that
we
rowed
across
the
harbour
of
syracuse
to
the
mouth
of
the
anapus
our
brown
rowers
leaping
overboard
pushed
the
boat
through
the
line
of
foam
where
bay
and
river
meet
and
we
passed
over
to
the
smooth
current
which
slips
seaward
between
flat
banks
fringed
with
arundo
donax
and
bamboo
the
bamboo
grows
in
vast
feathery
thickets
along
these
sicilian
waters
and
the
slightly
angular
precision
of
its
stem
and
foliage
allies
itself
well
with
the
classic
clearness
of
the
landscape
a
landscape
which
in
spite
of
an
occasional
excess
of
vegetation
yet
retains
the
greek
quality
of
producing
intense
effects
with
a
minimum
of
material
there
is
nothing
tropical
about
the
shores
of
the
anapus
but
as
the
river
turns
and
narrows
the
boat
passes
under
an
arch
of
egyptian
papyrus
that
slender
exotic
reed
brought
to
sicily
it
is
supposed
by
her
arabian
colonizers
and
thriving
strangely
enough
in
no
other
european
soil
this
plumy
tunnel
so
enclosed
us
as
we
advanced
that
for
long
stretches
of
our
indolent
progress
we
saw
only
the
face
of
the
stream
the
summer
insects
flickering
on
it
and
the
continuous
golden
line
of
irises
along
its
edge
now
and
then
however
a
gap
in
the
papyrus
showed
as
through
an
arch
in
a
wall
a
prospect
of
flat
fields
with
grazing
cattle
or
a
solitary
low
brown
with
a
spindling
against
its
or
the
white
flank
of
etna
suddenly
thrust
across
the
so
after
a
long
dreamy
lapse
of
time
we
came
to
the
source
of
the
river
the
azure
bowl
of
the
nymph
cyane
who
pours
her
pure
current
into
the
broader
anapus
the
haunt
of
the
nymph
is
a
circular
pool
supposedly
so
crystalline
that
she
may
still
be
seen
lurking
on
its
pebbly
bed
but
the
recent
spring
rains
had
clouded
her
lair
and
though
in
this
land
one
always
feels
the
nearness
of
faun
pursuing
the
nymph
the
pool
of
cyane
revealed
no
sign
of
her
presence
disappointed
in
our
quest
we
turned
back
and
glided
down
the
anapus
again
to
visit
her
the
more
famed
but
less
fortunate
arethusa
whose
unhappy
fate
it
is
to
mingle
her
wave
with
the
brackish
in
the
very
harbour
of
syracuse
where
under
the
wall
of
the
quay
the
poor
creature
languishes
in
a
prison
of
masonry
her
papyrus
wreath
sending
up
an
anæmic
growth
from
the
slimy
bottom
filled
with
green
we
were
glad
to
turn
from
this
desecrated
fount
to
the
long
town
curving
above
its
harbour
syracuse
girt
with
slopes
of
flowering
lies
nobly
against
the
fortified
ridge
of
epipolæ
but
the
city
itself
richer
in
history
than
any
other
on
that
crowded
soil
and
characteristically
symbolized
by
its
greek
temple
welded
into
the
masonry
of
a
mediæval
church
even
the
thronging
associations
of
the
city
could
not
on
a
day
so
prodigal
of
sunlight
hold
us
long
within
its
walls
these
walls
the
boundaries
of
the
greek
ortygia
have
once
more
become
the
limits
of
the
shrunken
modern
town
and
crossing
the
moat
beyond
them
we
found
ourselves
at
once
in
full
country
there
was
a
peculiar
charm
in
the
sudden
transition
from
the
old
brown
streets
saturated
with
history
to
this
clear
smiling
land
where
only
the
spring
seemed
to
have
written
its
tale
its
record
of
blossom
and
blade
miraculously
renewed
the
country
about
syracuse
is
peculiarly
fitted
to
be
the
exponent
of
this
gospel
of
renewal
the
land
stretches
away
in
mild
slopes
laden
with
acre
on
acre
of
blossoming
and
of
old
olive
orchards
under
which
the
lilac
anemones
have
room
to
spread
in
sheets
of
colour
the
open
pastures
are
plumed
with
silvery
asphodel
and
every
has
its
glossy
fenced
from
the
road
by
a
rampart
of
prickly
pear
the
highway
itself
as
we
drove
out
toward
epipolæ
was
thronged
with
who
might
have
been
the
descendants
of
theocritan
nymphs
and
mortal
shepherds
brown
folk
with
sidelong
agate
eyes
trudging
dustily
after
their
goats
and
asses
or
jogging
townward
in
their
little
blue
or
red
carts
painted
with
legends
of
the
saints
and
stories
from
ariosto
after
a
mile
or
two
the
road
curved
slowly
upward
and
we
began
to
command
a
widening
prospect
at
our
feet
lay
syracuse
girt
by
the
plemmyrian
marsh
and
by
the
fields
and
orchards
which
were
once
the
crowded
greek
suburbs
of
neapolis
tyche
and
achradina
and
beyond
the
ridge
of
epipolæ
and
the
nearer
hills
etna
rose
white
and
dominant
against
the
pale
calabrian
the
fortress
of
euryalus
on
the
crest
of
epipolæ
might
be
called
the
greek
carcassonne
since
it
is
the
example
of
ancient
military
architecture
in
europe
archways
galleries
massive
flights
of
stairs
and
long
subterranean
passages
may
still
be
traced
by
the
archæologically
minded
in
the
mass
of
fallen
stones
marking
the
site
of
the
ruin
and
even
the
idler
unversed
in
military
construction
will
feel
the
sudden
nearness
of
the
past
when
he
comes
upon
the
sockets
to
which
the
cavalry
attached
their
horses
euryalus
however
more
fortunate
than
carcassonne
has
escaped
the
renovating
hand
of
a
and
its
broken
ramparts
lie
in
mellow
ruin
along
the
backbone
of
the
ridge
feathered
with
those
delicate
growths
which
in
the
mediterranean
countries
veil
the
fallen
works
of
man
without
concealing
them
that
day
indeed
the
prodigal
blossoming
of
the
sicilian
march
had
covered
the
ground
with
a
suffusion
of
colour
which
made
even
the
mighty
ruins
of
the
fortress
seem
a
mere
background
for
the
triumphant
pageant
of
the
spring
from
the
tall
silhouette
of
the
asphodel
classic
in
outline
as
in
name
to
the
tendrils
of
scarlet
and
yellow
vetch
capriciously
fretting
the
ancient
stones
with
threads
of
richest
colour
every
inch
of
ground
and
every
cleft
of
masonry
was
overrun
with
some
delicate
wild
tracery
of
leaf
and
blossom
but
to
those
who
first
see
syracuse
in
the
month
of
march
the
heart
of
the
sicilian
spring
it
must
appear
as
one
vast
unbounded
garden
the
appeal
of
architecture
and
history
pales
before
this
vast
glory
of
the
loosened
soil
the
walls
and
towers
will
remain
but
this
transient
beauty
must
be
caught
upon
the
wing
and
so
from
the
flowered
slopes
of
euryalus
we
passed
to
the
richer
profusion
of
the
gardens
that
adjoin
the
town
fringing
the
road
by
which
we
descended
a
hundred
spring
flowers
anemones
lupins
sweet
alyssum
snapdragon
and
the
fragrant
wild
mignonette
linked
the
uncultivated
to
the
rich
horticulture
of
the
suburbs
and
in
the
suburbs
the
vegetation
reached
so
tropical
an
excess
that
the
spring
pilgrim
s
memory
of
syracuse
must
be
a
blur
of
ruins
immersed
in
a
sea
of
flowers
there
are
gardens
everywhere
gardens
of
all
kinds
and
classes
from
the
peasant
s
hut
hedged
with
pink
geraniums
to
the
villa
with
its
terraced
growths
but
most
wonderful
most
unexpected
of
all
are
the
famous
gardens
of
the
quarries
time
has
perhaps
never
done
a
more
poetic
thing
than
in
turning
these
bare
unshaded
pits
of
death
where
the
greek
captives
of
salamis
died
under
the
lash
of
the
sicilian
and
the
arrows
of
the
sicilian
sun
into
deep
cool
wells
of
shade
and
verdure
here
where
the
chivalry
of
athens
perished
of
heat
and
thirst
a
damp
mantle
of
foliage
pours
over
the
red
fills
the
depths
with
the
green
freshness
of
twilight
and
effaces
like
a
pitiful
hand
on
a
burning
brow
the
record
of
that
fiery
martyrdom
and
the
quarries
are
as
good
to
grow
flowers
in
as
to
torture
men
the
equable
warmth
of
these
sheltered
ravines
is
as
propitious
to
vegetation
as
it
was
destructive
to
human
life
and
wherever
soil
has
accumulated
on
the
ledges
and
in
the
hollows
the
blood
of
the
martyrs
sends
up
an
exuberant
growth
on
the
edge
of
one
of
these
a
monastery
has
been
built
above
another
stands
a
villa
and
monastic
and
secular
hands
have
transformed
the
sides
of
the
quarries
into
gardens
of
fantastic
beauty
paths
and
rocky
stairways
fringed
with
fern
wind
down
steeply
from
the
upper
world
now
tunnelled
through
dense
growths
of
cypress
and
olive
now
skirting
dripping
with
cataracts
of
ivy
or
tufted
with
the
glaucous
spikes
and
scarlet
rockets
of
gigantic
cactuses
in
the
depths
where
time
has
amassed
a
soil
incredibly
rich
the
vegetation
becomes
prodigious
febrile
like
that
of
the
delirious
garden
in
la
faute
de
l
abbé
here
the
paths
wind
under
groves
of
orange
and
lemon
trees
over
a
dense
carpeting
of
violets
stocks
narcissus
and
hyacinths
trellises
of
red
roses
lift
their
network
against
the
light
and
damp
clefts
of
the
rock
are
black
with
dripping
maidenhair
here
are
tall
hedges
of
blue
rosemary
and
abutilon
there
shrubby
masses
of
anthemisia
heliotrope
and
lavender
overhead
black
spring
from
the
bright
sea
of
foliage
and
at
the
pit
s
brink
where
the
syracusan
citizens
under
their
white
umbrellas
used
to
lean
over
and
taunt
the
captives
dying
in
the
sun
a
great
hedge
of
prickly
pear
writhes
mockingly
against
the
sky
iii
at
noon
of
such
another
day
we
set
out
from
rome
for
caprarola
the
still
air
had
a
pearly
quality
and
a
mauve
haze
hung
upon
the
hills
our
way
lay
toward
the
ciminian
mountains
once
free
of
the
gates
our
motor
started
on
its
steady
rush
along
the
white
highway
first
past
the
walls
of
vineyard
and
garden
and
then
across
the
grey
waste
spaces
of
the
campagna
the
roman
champaign
is
the
type
of
variety
in
monotony
seen
from
the
heights
of
the
city
it
reaches
in
silvery
sameness
toward
all
points
of
the
compass
but
to
a
near
view
it
reveals
a
dozen
different
physiognomies
toward
frascati
and
the
alban
hills
it
wears
the
ordered
garb
of
fertility
vineyards
and
in
the
direction
of
the
sabine
range
its
white
volcanic
reaches
are
tufted
with
a
dark
of
sullen
and
reluctant
growth
while
in
the
west
the
agro
romano
rolls
toward
monterosi
and
soracte
in
sere
reaches
of
mottled
with
hillock
and
ravine
gradually
as
we
left
the
outskirts
of
rome
the
grandeur
of
this
stern
landscape
declared
itself
to
the
right
and
left
the
land
stretched
out
in
endless
grassy
reaches
guarded
here
and
there
by
a
lonely
tomb
or
by
the
tall
gateway
of
some
abandoned
vineyard
presently
the
road
began
to
rise
and
dip
giving
us
on
the
ascent
sweeping
views
over
a
wider
range
of
downs
which
rolled
away
in
the
to
the
ciminian
forest
and
in
the
east
to
the
hazy
rampart
of
the
sabine
hills
ahead
of
us
the
same
undulations
swept
on
interminably
the
road
undulating
with
them
now
engulfed
in
the
trough
of
the
land
now
tossed
into
view
on
some
farther
slope
like
a
streak
of
light
on
a
flying
sea
there
was
something
strangely
inspiriting
in
the
call
of
this
fugitive
road
from
distances
it
seemed
to
signal
us
on
luring
us
up
slope
after
slope
and
racing
ahead
of
us
down
the
long
declivities
where
the
motor
panted
after
it
like
a
pack
on
the
trail
for
some
time
the
thrill
of
the
chase
distracted
us
from
a
nearer
view
of
the
foreground
but
gradually
there
stole
on
us
a
sense
of
breadth
and
quietude
of
rugged
fields
with
black
cattle
grazing
in
their
hollows
and
here
and
there
a
fortified
lifting
its
bulk
against
the
sky
these
of
the
campagna
standing
sullen
and
apart
among
the
pacific
ruins
of
pagan
rome
tombs
aqueducts
and
villas
give
a
glimpse
of
that
black
age
which
rose
on
the
wreck
of
the
imperial
civilization
all
the
violence
and
savagery
of
the
mediæval
city
with
its
great
nobles
forever
in
revolt
its
popes
plotting
and
trembling
within
the
lateran
walls
or
dragging
their
captive
cardinals
from
point
to
point
as
the
emperor
or
the
french
king
moved
his
forces
all
the
mysterious
crimes
of
passion
and
cupidity
the
intrigues
ambushes
massacres
with
which
the
pages
of
the
old
chronicles
reek
seem
symbolized
in
one
of
those
lowering
brown
piles
with
its
battlemented
crouched
on
a
knoll
of
the
waste
land
which
its
masters
helped
to
devastate
at
length
a
blue
pool
the
little
lake
of
monterosi
broke
the
expanse
of
the
downs
then
we
flashed
through
a
poor
roadside
village
of
the
same
name
and
so
upward
into
a
where
hedgerows
and
copses
began
to
replace
the
brown
tufting
of
the
campagna
on
and
on
we
fled
ever
upward
to
the
town
of
ronciglione
perched
like
many
of
this
region
on
the
sheer
edge
of
a
ravine
and
stretching
its
line
of
baroque
churches
and
stately
crumbling
palaces
along
one
steep
street
to
the
edge
of
a
lofty
down
across
this
plateau
golden
with
budding
broom
we
flew
on
to
the
next
height
and
here
paused
to
embrace
the
spectacle
beneath
us
on
the
left
the
blue
volcanic
lake
of
vico
in
its
crater
on
the
right
far
below
the
plain
of
etruria
scattered
with
ancient
cities
and
ringed
in
a
still
touched
with
snow
and
rising
from
the
middle
of
the
plain
soracte
proud
wrinkled
solitary
with
the
ruined
monastery
of
sant
oreste
just
seen
on
its
crest
illustration
italian
sky
in
from
this
mount
of
vision
we
dropped
abruptly
downward
by
a
road
cut
in
the
red
presently
there
began
to
run
along
the
crest
of
the
tufa
on
our
left
a
lofty
wall
gripping
the
flanks
of
the
rock
and
overhung
by
dark
splashes
of
ivy
and
clumps
of
leafless
trees
one
of
those
rugged
italian
walls
which
are
the
custodians
of
such
hidden
treasures
of
scent
and
verdure
this
wall
continued
to
run
parallel
with
us
till
our
steep
descent
ended
in
a
square
with
the
roofs
of
a
town
sliding
abruptly
away
below
it
on
one
side
and
above
on
the
other
the
great
ramps
and
terraces
of
a
pentagonal
palace
clenched
to
the
highest
ledge
of
the
cliff
such
is
the
first
sight
of
caprarola
never
surely
did
feudal
construction
so
insolently
dominate
its
possessions
the
palace
of
the
great
farnese
cardinal
seems
to
lord
it
not
only
over
the
town
which
forms
its
footstool
but
over
the
etrurian
plain
the
forests
and
mountains
of
the
horizon
over
nepi
sutri
cività
castellana
and
the
lonely
pride
of
soracte
and
the
grandeur
of
the
site
is
matched
by
the
arrogance
of
the
building
no
villa
but
a
fortified
and
moated
palace
or
rather
a
fortress
planned
in
accordance
with
the
most
advanced
military
science
of
the
day
but
built
on
the
lines
of
a
palace
yet
on
such
a
march
day
as
this
with
the
foreground
of
brown
all
slashed
and
fringed
with
rosy
with
the
haze
of
spring
just
melting
from
the
horizon
and
revealing
depth
after
depth
of
with
march
clouds
fleeing
overhead
and
flinging
trails
of
shadow
and
showers
of
silver
light
across
the
undulations
of
the
plain
on
such
a
day
the
insolent
farnese
keep
for
all
its
background
of
gardens
frescoes
and
architectural
splendour
seems
no
longer
the
lord
of
the
landscape
but
a
mere
point
of
vantage
from
which
to
view
the
outspread
glory
at
our
feet
iv
the
drive
from
viterbo
to
montefiascone
lies
across
the
high
plateau
between
the
monte
cimino
and
the
lake
of
bolsena
for
the
best
part
of
the
way
the
landscape
is
pastoral
and
agricultural
with
patches
of
to
which
in
march
the
leaves
still
cling
and
on
this
fitful
march
morning
with
rain
in
the
shifting
clouds
the
ploughmen
move
behind
their
white
oxen
under
umbrellas
as
vividly
green
as
the
young
wheat
here
are
none
of
the
great
bursts
of
splendour
which
mark
the
way
from
rome
to
caprarola
and
it
seems
fitting
that
this
more
prosaic
road
should
be
travelled
at
a
sober
pace
in
a
viterban
behind
two
plodding
horses
the
horses
are
not
so
plodding
however
but
that
they
swing
us
briskly
enough
down
the
short
descents
of
the
rolling
country
which
now
becomes
wilder
and
more
diversified
with
stretches
of
woodland
interspersed
with
a
heathy
growth
of
low
fragrant
shrubs
here
the
slopes
are
thick
with
primroses
and
the
blue
vinca
and
violet
peep
through
the
ivy
trails
of
the
hedgerows
but
the
trees
are
still
leafless
for
it
is
a
high
region
where
march
practises
few
of
her
milder
arts
a
lonely
country
too
no
villages
and
only
a
few
solitary
are
to
be
seen
as
we
jog
up
and
down
the
monotonous
undulations
of
the
road
to
the
foot
of
montefiascone
the
town
overhangs
us
splendidly
on
a
spur
above
the
lake
of
bolsena
and
a
long
ascent
between
fortified
walls
leads
to
the
summit
on
which
its
buildings
are
huddled
through
the
curtain
of
rain
which
the
skies
have
now
let
down
the
crooked
streets
with
their
archways
and
old
blackened
stone
houses
present
no
striking
effects
though
doubtless
a
bright
day
would
draw
from
them
some
of
that
latent
picturesqueness
which
is
never
far
to
seek
when
italian
masonry
and
italian
sunlight
meet
meanwhile
however
the
rain
persists
and
the
environment
of
montefiascone
remains
so
obstinately
shrouded
that
for
all
we
know
the
town
may
be
situated
nowhere
like
the
famous
scene
in
festus
through
this
air
led
blindfold
as
it
were
we
presently
descend
again
by
the
same
windings
to
the
city
gates
and
thence
following
the
road
to
bagnorea
come
on
the
desolate
church
of
san
flaviano
lying
by
itself
in
a
hollow
beneath
the
walls
of
the
town
in
our
hasty
dash
from
the
carriage
to
the
door
there
is
just
time
to
receive
the
impression
of
an
immensely
old
brick
façade
distorted
and
scarred
with
that
kind
of
age
which
only
the
latin
sense
of
antiquity
has
kept
a
word
to
describe
then
we
are
in
a
cavernous
interior
with
spectral
frescoes
emerging
here
and
there
from
the
universal
background
of
whitewash
and
above
the
choir
a
spreading
gallery
or
upper
church
which
makes
of
the
lower
building
a
species
of
crypt
above
ground
and
here
o
irony
of
fate
in
this
old
deserted
and
church
under
a
worn
slab
before
the
abandoned
altar
for
it
is
only
in
the
upper
church
that
mass
continues
to
be
said
here
a
castaway
as
it
were
from
both
worlds
lies
that
genial
offshoot
of
a
famous
race
the
bishop
fugger
whose
lust
of
the
palate
brought
him
to
this
lonely
end
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
pass
through
montefiascone
without
dropping
a
commemorative
tear
on
the
classic
upon
which
till
so
lately
a
good
cask
of
montefiascone
has
been
yearly
broached
in
memory
of
the
prelate
s
end
yet
one
feels
a
regret
almost
in
carrying
away
such
a
chill
recollection
of
the
poor
bishop
s
fate
in
leaving
him
to
the
solitude
of
that
icy
limbo
which
seems
so
disproportionate
a
punishment
for
his
amiable
failing
leaving
san
flaviano
we
press
on
toward
orvieto
through
an
unbroken
blur
of
rain
the
weary
miles
leave
no
trace
in
memory
and
we
are
still
in
an
indeterminate
region
of
wood
and
pasture
and
hills
when
gradually
the
downpour
ceases
and
streaks
of
sunset
begin
to
part
the
clouds
almost
at
the
same
moment
a
dip
of
the
road
brings
us
out
above
a
long
descent
with
a
wavy
plain
at
its
base
and
reared
up
on
a
cliff
above
the
plain
a
fierce
brown
city
walled
towered
and
pinnacled
which
seems
to
have
dropped
from
the
sky
like
some
huge
beast
of
prey
and
locked
its
talons
in
the
rock
all
about
the
plain
in
the
watery
evening
light
rises
a
line
of
hills
with
monte
amiata
thrusting
its
peak
above
the
circle
the
nearer
slopes
are
clothed
in
olive
and
cypress
with
castles
and
monasteries
jutting
from
their
ledges
and
just
below
us
the
sight
of
an
arched
bridge
across
a
ravine
with
a
clump
of
trees
at
its
approach
touches
a
spring
of
memory
and
transports
us
from
the
actual
scene
to
its
pictured
presentment
turner
s
road
to
it
was
in
fact
from
this
point
that
the
picture
was
painted
and
looking
forth
on
the
landscape
with
its
stormy
blending
of
washed
in
pallid
sunlight
one
sees
in
it
the
vindication
of
turner
s
art
that
true
impressionism
which
consists
not
in
the
unimaginative
noting
of
actual
bits
but
in
the
reconstruction
of
a
scene
as
it
has
flowed
into
the
mould
of
memory
the
merging
of
fragmentary
facts
into
a
homogeneous
impression
this
is
what
turner
has
done
to
the
view
of
orvieto
from
the
bolsena
road
so
summing
up
and
interpreting
the
spirit
of
the
scene
that
the
traveller
pausing
by
the
arched
bridge
above
the
valley
loses
sense
of
the
boundaries
between
art
and
life
and
lives
for
a
moment
in
that
mystical
region
where
the
two
are
one
v
our
friends
and
counsellors
had
for
many
years
warned
us
against
visiting
vallombrosa
in
march
the
month
which
oftenest
finds
us
in
tuscany
wait
till
june
they
advised
and
knowing
the
complexity
of
influences
which
go
to
make
up
an
italian
sensation
and
how
for
lack
of
one
ingredient
the
whole
mixture
may
lose
its
savour
we
had
obediently
waited
for
june
but
june
in
florence
never
seemed
to
come
the
time
and
the
place
were
no
more
to
meet
in
our
horoscope
than
in
the
poet
s
and
so
one
year
when
march
was
playing
at
april
we
decided
to
take
advantage
of
her
mood
and
risk
the
adventure
we
set
out
early
in
that
burnished
morning
air
which
seems
as
with
a
fine
burin
to
retrace
overnight
every
line
of
the
tuscan
landscape
the
railway
runs
southward
along
the
arno
valley
to
sant
ellero
and
we
might
have
been
travelling
through
some
background
of
mantegna
s
or
robetta
s
in
which
the
clear
pale
colours
of
early
spring
were
but
an
effect
of
subtle
blendings
of
line
this
tuscan
hill
scenery
which
for
purity
of
modelling
has
no
match
short
of
greece
is
seen
to
the
best
advantage
in
march
when
the
conformation
of
the
land
is
still
unveiled
by
foliage
and
every
line
tells
like
the
threads
of
silver
in
a
from
sant
ellero
where
the
train
is
exchanged
for
a
little
funicular
car
of
primitive
construction
we
were
pushed
jerkily
uphill
by
a
gasping
engine
which
had
to
be
constantly
refreshed
by
long
draughts
of
water
from
wayside
tanks
on
such
a
day
however
it
was
impossible
to
grudge
the
slowness
of
the
ascent
as
we
mounted
higher
the
country
developed
beneath
us
with
that
precision
of
detail
which
gives
to
extended
views
in
a
curiously
look
as
though
they
had
been
wrought
out
by
a
hand
enamoured
of
definition
and
unskilled
in
the
creation
of
general
effects
the
new
wheat
springing
under
the
olives
was
the
only
high
note
of
colour
all
else
was
of
earth
of
and
village
belfries
of
rusty
cypresses
climbing
the
in
straight
interminable
lines
and
faint
blush
of
floating
against
grey
olives
then
we
gained
a
new
height
and
the
details
of
the
foreground
were
lost
in
a
vast
unfolding
of
distances
hill
on
hill
blurred
with
or
bare
and
with
a
sprinkling
of
on
their
slopes
and
here
and
there
a
on
a
jutting
spur
and
beyond
these
again
a
tossing
sunlit
sea
of
peaks
its
farthest
waves
still
crested
with
snow
half
way
up
the
abrupt
slopes
of
which
we
had
skirted
gave
way
to
a
plateau
clothed
with
vines
and
budding
fruit
orchards
then
another
sharp
climb
through
across
the
dry
beds
of
and
up
slopes
of
broom
and
heather
brought
us
to
the
topmost
ledge
where
the
railway
ends
on
this
ledge
stands
the
dreary
village
of
saltina
a
cluster
of
houses
set
like
boxes
on
a
shelf
with
a
hôtel
milton
among
them
and
a
background
of
swiss
chalets
dotted
forlornly
on
a
treeless
slope
saltina
must
be
arid
even
in
midsummer
and
in
march
it
was
a
place
to
fly
from
our
flight
however
was
regulated
by
the
leisurely
gait
of
a
small
white
donkey
who
was
the
only
de
to
be
had
at
that
early
season
and
behind
whom
we
slowly
turned
the
shoulder
of
the
cliff
and
entered
the
pillared
twilight
of
a
great
the
road
ran
through
this
wood
for
a
mile
or
two
carrying
us
straight
to
the
heart
of
the
etrurian
shades
as
we
advanced
byways
branched
off
to
the
right
and
left
climbing
the
through
of
verdure
and
presently
we
came
to
a
wide
turfy
hollow
where
the
great
trees
recede
leaving
a
space
for
the
monastery
and
its
adjacent
buildings
the
principal
faces
on
a
walled
with
paths
leading
to
the
fine
arcaded
portico
of
the
church
these
buildings
are
backed
by
a
hanging
wood
with
a
hermitage
on
its
crest
the
paradiso
but
before
them
lies
an
open
expanse
studded
with
ancient
trees
with
a
and
grass
walks
leading
down
to
mossy
glens
with
the
sound
of
streams
in
their
depths
facing
the
monastery
stands
the
low
building
where
pilgrims
were
formerly
lodged
and
which
now
without
farther
modification
than
the
change
of
name
has
become
the
albergo
della
foresta
while
the
monastery
itself
has
been
turned
into
a
government
school
of
forestry
since
change
was
inevitable
it
is
a
fortunate
accident
which
has
housed
a
sylvan
college
in
these
venerable
shades
and
sent
the
foresters
to
carry
on
the
husbandry
of
the
monks
never
surely
were
the
inevitable
modifications
of
time
more
gently
tempered
to
the
survivor
of
earlier
conditions
the
monastery
of
vallombrosa
has
neither
the
examinate
air
of
a
nor
that
look
of
desecration
and
decadency
that
too
often
comes
with
altered
uses
it
has
preserved
its
high
atmosphere
of
meditative
peace
and
the
bands
of
students
flitting
through
the
forest
with
and
agricultural
tools
seem
the
lawful
successors
of
the
monks
we
had
been
told
in
florence
that
winter
still
held
the
mountains
that
we
should
find
snow
in
the
shady
hollows
and
a
glacial
wind
from
the
peaks
but
spring
airs
followed
us
to
the
heights
through
the
aromatic
the
sunlight
slanted
as
warmly
as
down
the
of
the
boboli
gardens
and
over
the
open
slopes
about
the
monastery
there
ran
a
flush
of
crocuses
not
here
and
there
in
scattered
drifts
or
starring
the
grass
as
in
the
foregrounds
of
mantegna
and
botticelli
but
so
that
they
formed
a
continuous
sheet
of
colour
a
tide
of
lilac
which
submerged
the
turf
and
flowing
between
the
ancient
invaded
even
the
dark
edges
of
the
forest
it
was
probably
the
one
moment
of
the
year
at
which
the
forest
flushes
into
colour
its
hour
of
transfiguration
we
might
have
tried
every
other
season
and
missed
the
miracle
of
march
in
vallombrosa
at
first
the
eye
was
dazzled
by
this
vast
field
of
the
and
could
take
in
none
of
the
more
delicate
indications
of

but
presently
we
found
our
way
to
the
lower
glens
where
the
crocuses
ceased
and
primroses
poured
over
to
the
brink
of
brooks
in
the
forest
too
ferns
were
uncurling
and
violets
thrusting
themselves
through
the
close
matting
of
while
the
terraces
of
the
monks
garden
which
climbs
the
near
the
monastery
were
fragrant
with
budding
box
and
beds
of
tulip
and
narcissus
it
was
an
air
to
idle
in
breathing
deep
the
stored
warmth
of
immemorial
springs
but
the
little
donkey
waited
between
the
shafts
of
his
and
on
the
ledge
of
saltina
we
knew
that
our
engine
was
taking
a
last
draught
before
the
descent
reluctantly
we
jogged
back
through
the
forest
and
regaining
our
seats
in
the
train
plunged
downward
into
a
sea
of
translucent
mountains
and
valleys
bathed
in
haze
a
great
reach
of
irradiated
heights
flowing
by
imperceptible
gradations
into
amber
depths
of
air

below
us
the
shadows
fell
and
the

gleamed
white

picturesque
milan
i
it
is
hard
to
say
whether
the
stock
phrase
of
the
stock
tourist
there
is
so
little
to
see
in
milan
redounds
most
to
the
derision
of
the
speaker
or
to
the
glory
of
italy
that
such
a
judgment
should
be
possible
even
to
the
least
instructed
traveller
implies
a
surfeit
of
impressions
procurable
in
no
other
land
since
to
the
hastiest
observation
milan
could
hardly
seem
lacking
in
interest
when
compared
to
any
but
italian
cities
from
comparison
with
the
latter
even
it
suffers
only
on
a
superficial
estimate
for
it
is
rich
in
all
that
makes
the
indigenous
beauty
of
italy
as
opposed
to
the
the
points
and
pinnacles
which
ruskin
taught
a
submissive
generation
of
art
critics
to
regard
as
the
typical
expression
of
the
italian
spirit
the
long
accustomed
to
draw
their
liebig
s
extract
of
art
from
the
pages
of
this
school
of
critics
have
kept
the
tradition
alive
by
dwelling
only
on
the
monuments
which
conform
to
perpendicular
ideals
and
by
apologetic
allusions
to
the
monotony
and
regularity
of
milan
as
though
endeavouring
in
advance
to
placate
the
traveller
for
its
not
looking
like
florence
or
siena
illustration
of
the
palazzo
marino
now
the
of
late
indeed
a
new
school
of
writers
among
whom
anderson
and
the
german
authors
ebe
and
gurlitt
deserve
the
first
mention
have
broken
through
this
conspiracy
of
silence
and
called
attention
to
the
intrinsically
italian
art
of
the
period
the
period
which
from
michael
angelo
to
juvara
has
been
marked
in
sculpture
and
architecture
though
more
rarely
in
painting
by
a
series
of
memorable
names
signor
franchetti
s
admirable
monograph
on
bernini
and
the
recent
volume
on
tiepolo
in
the
knackfuss
series
of
have
done
their
part
in
this
redistribution
of
values
and
it
is
now
possible
for
the
traveller
to
survey
the
course
of
italian
art
with
the
impartiality
needful
for
its
due
enjoyment
and
to
admire
for
instance
the
tower
of
the
mangia
without
scorning
the
palace
of
the
consulta
ii
but
it
may
be
asked
though
milan
will
seem
more
interesting
to
the
emancipated
judgment
will
it
appear
more
picturesque
picturesqueness
is
after
all
what
the
italian
pilgrim
chiefly
seeks
and
the
current
notion
of
the
picturesque
is
a
purely
germanic
one
connoting
gothic
steeples
turrets
and
the
huddled
steepness
of
the
northern
burgh
italy
offers
little
and
milan
least
of
all
to
satisfy
these
requirements
the
latin
ideal
demanded
space
order
and
nobility
of
composition
but
does
it
follow
that
picturesqueness
is
incompatible
with
these
take
up
one
of
piranesi
s
etchings
those
strange
compositions
in
which
he
sought
to
seize
the
spirit
of
a
city
or
a
quarter
by
a
mingling
of
its
most
characteristic
features
even
the
northern
conception
of
the
picturesque
must
be
satisfied
by
the
sombre
wildness
of
these
studies
here
a
ruined
aqueduct
casting
its
shade
across
a
lonely
stretch
of
ground
tufted
with
acanthus
there
a
palace
colonnade
through
which
the
moonlight
sweeps
on
a
winter
wind
or
the
recesses
of
some
mighty
roman
bath
where
cloaked
figures
are
huddled
in
dark
confabulation
canaletto
s
studies
give
in
a
lesser
degree
the
same
impression
of
the
grotesque
and
the
fantastic
the
of
that
so
long
regarded
as
the
smirk
on
the
face
of
a
conventional
age
but
there
is
another
a
more
typically
italian
picturesqueness
gay
rather
than
sinister
in
its
suggestions
made
up
of
lights
rather
than
of
shadows
of
colour
rather
than
of
outline
and
this
is
the
picturesqueness
of
milan
the
city
abounds
in
vivid
effects
in
suggestive
juxtapositions
of
different
centuries
and
styles
in
all
those
incidental
contrasts
and
surprises
which
linger
in
the
mind
after
the
catalogued
sights
have
faded
leaving
behind
the
wide
modern
streets
which
have
the
merit
of
having
been
modernized
under
eugène

than
under

enters
at
once
upon
some
narrow
byway
overhung
by
the
grated
windows
of
a
palace
or
by
the
delicate
apse
of
a
church
everywhere
the
forms
of
expression
are
purely
italian
with
the
smallest
possible
admixture
of
that
gothic
element
which
marks
the
old
free
cities
of
central
italy
the
rocca
sforzesca
the
old
sforza
castle
and
the
houses
about
the
piazza
de
mercanti
are
the
chief
secular
buildings
recalling
the
pointed
architecture
of
the
north
and
the
older
churches
are
so
old
that
they
antedate
gothic
influences
and
lead
one
back
to
the
basilican
type
but
in
the
line
of
national
descent
what
exquisite
varieties
the
milanese
streets
present
here
for
instance
is
the
corinthian
colonnade
of
san
lorenzo
the
only
considerable
fragment
of
ancient
mediolanum
its
last
shaft
abutting
on
a
gothic
archway
against
which
clings
a
shrine
close
by
one
comes
on
the
ancient
octagonal
church
of
san
lorenzo
while
a
few
minutes
drive
leads
to
where
the
borromeo
palace
looks
across
a
quiet
grassy
square
at
the
rococo
front
of
the
old
family
church
flanked
by
a
fine
bronze
statue
of
the
great
saint
and
cardinal
the
palazzo
borromeo
is
itself
a
notable
factor
in
the
picturesqueness
of
milan
the
entrance
leads
to
a
enclosed
in
an
ogive
arcade
surmounted
by
pointed
windows
in
mouldings
the
walls
of
this
court
are
still
frescoed
with
the
borromean
crown
and
the
of
the
haughty
race
and
a
doorway
leads
into
the
where
the
archives
of
the
house
are
still
stored
and
where
on
the
damp
stone
walls
michelino
da
milano
has
depicted
the
scenes
of
a
villeggiatura
here
the
noble
ladies
of
the
house
in
high
fluted
turbans
and
fantastic
gowns
may
be
seen
treading
the
measures
of
a
mediæval
dance
with
young
gallants
in
hose
or
playing
at
various
games
the
de
and
a
kind
of
cricket
played
with
a
long
wooden
bat
while
in
the
background
rise
the
mountains
about
lake
maggiore
and
the
peaked
outline
of
the
isola
bella
then
a
bare
rock
unadorned
with
gardens
and
architecture
these
frescoes
the
only
existing
works
of
a
lombard
artist
are
suggestive
in
style
of
pisanello
s
dry
and
vigorous
manner
and
as
records
of
the
private
life
of
the
italian
nobility
in
the
fifteenth
century
they
are
second
only
to
the
remarkable
pictures
of
the
schifanoia
at
ferrara
not
far
from
the
borromean
palace
another
doorway
leads
to
a
different
scene
the
great
cloister
of
the
ospedale
maggiore
one
of
the
most
glorious
monuments
that
man
ever
erected
to
his
fellows
the
old
hospitals
of
italy
were
famous
not
only
for
their
architectural
beauty
and
great
extent
but
for
their
cleanliness
and
order
and
the
enlightened
care
which
their
inmates
received
northern
travellers
have
recorded
their
wondering
admiration
of
these
lazarets
which
seemed
as
stately
as
palaces
in
comparison
with
the
miserable
north
of
the
alps
what
must
have
been
the
astonishment
of
such
a
traveller
whether
german
or
english
on
setting
foot
in
the
principal
court
of
the
milanese
hospital
enclosed
in
its
vast
cloister
enriched
with
traceries
and
medallions
of
and
surmounted
by
the
arches
of
an
open
loggia
whence
the
patients
could
look
down
on
a
peaceful
expanse
of
grass
and
flowers
even
now
one
wonders
whether
this
poetizing
of
philanthropy
this
clothing
of
charity
in
the
garb
of
beauty
may
not
have
had
its
healing
uses
whether
the
ugliness
of
the
modern
hospital
may
not
make
it
in
another
sense
as
unhygienic
as
the
more
picturesque
buildings
it
has
superseded
it
is
at
least
pleasant
to
think
of
the
poor
sick
people
sunning
themselves
in
the
beautiful
loggia
of
the
ospedale
maggiore
or
sitting
under
the
in
the
garden
while
their
and
nurses
move
quietly
through
the
cloisters
at
the
summons
of
the
illustration
tower
of
peixotto
milano
but
one
need
not
enter
a
or
cross
a
threshold
to
appreciate
the
variety
and
colour
of
milan
the
streets
themselves
are
full
of
charming
detail
marble
portals
set
with
medallions
of
sforzas
in
round
caps
and
plaited
tunics
windows
framed
in
wreaths
of
fruit
and
flowers
iron
balconies
etching
their
elaborate
arabesques
against
the
stucco
mighty
doorways
flanked
by
atlantides
like
that
of
pompeo
leoni
s
house
the
degli
and
of
the
jesuit
seminary
or
rococo
churches
with
pyramids
broken
pediments
flying
angels
and
vases
filled
with
it
is
in
summer
that
these
streets
are
at
their
best
then
the
old
gardens
overhanging
the
naviglio
the
canal
which
intersects
milan
with
a
layer
of
venice
repeat
in
its
waters
their
marble
loggias
hung
with
the
vine
and
their
untrained
profusion
of
roses
and
camellias
then
in
the
more
aristocratic
streets
the
palace
doorways
yield
vistas
of
double
and
triple
with
arcades
enclosing
spaces
of
shady
turf
and
terminating
perhaps
in
a
fountain
set
in
some
splendid
architectural
composition
against
the
inner
wall
of
the
building
in
summer
too
the
dark
archways
in
the
humbler
quarters
of
the
town
are
brightened
by
embowered
in
foliage
and
heaped
with
such
melons
figs
and
peaches
as
would
have
driven
to
fresh
extravagance
the
exuberant
brush
of
a
flemish
then
again
at
the
turn
of
a
street
one
comes
across
some
little
church
just
celebrating
the
feast
of
its
patron
saint
with
a
brave
display
of
garlands
and
red
hangings
while
close
by
a
cavernous
has
been
festooned
with
more
garlands
and
with
bright
nosegays
amid
which
hang
the
painted
candles
and
other
votive
offerings
designed
to
attract
the
small
coin
of
the
faithful
iii
yet
milan
is
not
dependent
on
the
seasons
for
this
midsummer
magic
of
light
and
colour
for
dark
days
it
keeps
its
store
of
warmth
and
brightness
hidden
behind
palace
walls
and
in
the
cold
dusk
of
church
and
cloister
summer
in
all
its
throbbing
heat
has
been
imprisoned
by
tiepolo
in
the
great
ceiling
of
the
palazzo
clerici
that
revel
of
gods
and
and
mortals
of
all
lands
and
races
who
advance
with
linked
hands
out
of
the
rosy
vapours
of
dawn
nor
are
loftier
wanting
on
the
walls
of
san
maurizio
maggiore
luini
s
virgin
martyrs
move
as
in
the
very
afterglow
of
legend
that
hesitating
light
in
which
the
fantastic
becomes
probable
and
the
boundaries
between
reality
and
vision
fade
while
tints
of
another
sort
but
as
tender
as
harmonious
float
through
the
dusk
of
the
sacristy
of
santa
maria
delle
grazie
a
dim
room
panelled
with
with
its
grated
windows
veiled
by
but
nothing
in
milan
approaches
in
beauty
the
of
the
portinari
chapel
behind
the
choir
of
sant
eustorgio
in
italy
even
there
is
nothing
else
exactly
comparable
to
this
masterpiece
of
collaboration
between
architect
and
painter
at
ravenna
the
tomb
of
galla
placidia
and
the
apse
of
san
vitale
glow
with
richer
hues
and
the
lower
church
of
assisi
is
unmatched
in
its
shifting
mystery
of
chiar
but
for
pure
light
for
a
clear
shadowless
scale
of
iridescent
tints
what
can
approach
the
portinari
chapel
its
most
striking
feature
is
the
harmony
of
form
and
colour
which
makes
the
decorative
design
of
michelozzo
flow
into
and
seem
a
part
of
the
exquisite
frescoes
of
vincenzo
foppa
this
harmony
is
not
the
result
of
any
voluntary
feint
any
such
trickery
of
the
brush
as
the
later
decorative
painters
delighted
in
in
the
portinari
chapel
architecture
and
painting
are
kept
distinct
in
treatment
and
the
fusion
between
them
is
effected
by
unity
of
line
and
colour
and
still
more
perhaps
by
an
identity
of
sentiment
which
keeps
the
whole
chapel
in
the
same
mood
of
blitheness
a
mood
which
makes
it
difficult
to
remember
that
the
chapel
is
the
mausoleum
of
a
martyred
saint
but
saint
peter
martyr
s
marble
sarcophagus
rich
and
splendid
as
it
is
somehow
fails
to
distract
the
attention
from
its
setting
there
are
so
many
mediæval
monuments
like
it
in
italy
and
there
is
but
one
portinari
chapel
from
the
cupola
with
its
scales
of
pale
red
and
blue
overlapping
each
other
like
the
of
a
pigeon
and
terminating
in
a
frieze
of
dancing
angels
who
swing
between
them
great
bells
of
fruit
and
flowers
the
eye
is
led
by
insensible
gradations
of
tint
to
foppa
s
frescoes
in
the
spandrils
iridescent
saints
and
angels
in
a
setting
of
pale
classical
architecture
and
thence
to
another
frieze
of
seraphs
with
wings
against
a
background
of
this
lower
frieze
resting
in
turn
on
pilasters
of
adorned
with
white
stucco
of
little
angels
it
is
only
as
a
part
of
this
that
the
central
sarcophagus
really
affects
one
the
ivory
tint
of
its
old
marble
forming
a
central
point
for
the
play
of
light
and
allying
itself
with
the
sumptuous
hues
of
portinari
s
dress
in
the
fresco
which
represents
the
donator
of
the
chapel
kneeling
before
his
patron
saint
iv
the
picturesqueness
of
milan
has
overflowed
on
its
environs
and
there
are
several
directions
in
which
one
may
prolong
the
enjoyment
of
its
characteristic
art
the
great
certosa
of
pavia
can
alas
no
longer
be
included
in
a
category
of
the
picturesque
secularized
catalogued
railed
off
from
the
who
is
hurried
through
its
endless
corridors
on
the
heels
of
a
government
custodian
it
still
ministers
to
the
sense
of
beauty
but
no
longer
excites
those
subtler
sensations
which
dwell
in
the
atmosphere
of
a
work
of
art
rather
than
in
itself
such
sensations
must
be
sought
in
the
other
deserted
certosa
at
chiaravalle
the
abbey
church
with
its
noble
colonnaded
cupola
is
still
one
of
the
most
conspicuous
objects
in
the
flat
landscape
about
milan
but
within
all
is
falling
to
ruin
and
one
feels
the
melancholy
charm
of
a
beautiful
building
which
has
been
allowed
to
decay
as
naturally
as
a
tree
the
disintegrating
touch
of
nature
is
less
cruel
than
the
restoring
touch
of
man
and
the
frescoes
and
of
chiaravalle
retain
more
of
their
original
significance
than
the
treasures
of
pavia
less
melancholy
than
chiaravalle
and
as
yet
unspoiled
by
the
touch
of
official
preservation
is
the

the
madonna

long
avenue

ornamental
additions

the
seventeenth
century
within
it
is
famous
for
the
frescoes
of
luini
in
the
choir
and
of
gaudenzio
ferrari
in
the
cupola
the
luini
frescoes
are
full
of
a
serene
impersonal
beauty
painted
in
his
latest
phase
when
he
had
fallen
under
the
influence
of
raphael
and
the
grand
manner
they
lack
the
intimate
charm
of
his
early
works
yet
the
lombard
note
the
leonardesque
quality
lingers
here
and
there
in
the
glance
of
the
women
and
in
the
beauty
of
the
adolescent
heads

it
finds
completer
expression
in
the
exquisite

figures
of

if
these

of

on
the
contrary
to
sum
up
in
one
glorious
burst
of
expression
all
his
fancy
had
ever
evoked
and
his
hand
longed
to
embody
it
seems
to
have
been
given
to
certain
artists
to
attain
once
at
least
to
this
full
moment
of
expression
to
titian
for
instance
in
the
bacchus
and
ariadne
to
michael
angelo
in
the
monuments
of
the
medici
to
giorgione
in
the
sylvan
concert
of
the
louvre
in
other
works
they
may
reveal
greater
powers
more
magnificent
conceptions
but
once
only
perhaps
is
it
given
to
each
to
achieve
the
perfect
equipoise
of
mind
and
hand
and
in
that
moment
even
the
lesser
artists
verge
on
greatness
gaudenzio
found
his
opportunity
in
the
cupola
of
saronno
and
for
once
he
rises
above
the
charming
anecdotic
painter
of
varallo
to
the
brotherhood
of
the
masters
it
is
as
the
expression
of
a
mood
that
his
power
reveals
itself
the
mood
of
heavenly
joyousness
so
vividly
embodied
in
his
circle
of
choiring
angels
that
form
seems
to
pass
into
sound
and
the
dome
to
be
filled
with
a
burst
of
heavenly
jubilation
with
unfaltering
hand
he
has
sustained
this
note
of
joyousness
nowhere
does
his
invention
fail
or
his
brush
lag
behind
it
the
sunny
crowding
heads
the
flying
draperies
the
fluttering
scores
of
the
music
are
stirred
as
by
a
wind
of
inspiration
a
breeze
from
the
celestial
pastures
the
walls
of
the
choir
seem
to
resound
with
one
of
the
of
faust
or
with
the
last
chiming
lines
of
the
happy
the
artist
whose
full
powers
find
voice
in
such
a
key
v
the
reader
who
has
followed
these
desultory
wanderings
through
milan
has
but
touched
the
hem
of
her
garment
in
the
brera
the
ambrosiana
the
gallery
and
the
magnificent
new
archæological
museum
now
fittingly
housed
in
the
old
castle
of
the
sforzas
are
treasures
second
only
to
those
of
rome
and
florence
but
these
are
among
the
catalogued
riches
of
the
city
the
point
to
them
they
lie
in
the
beaten
track
of
and
it
is
rather
in
the
intervals
between
such
systematized
study
of
the
past
in
the
parentheses
of
travel
that
one
obtains
those
more
intimate
glimpses
which
help
to
compose
the
image
of
each
city
to
preserve
its
personality
in
the
traveller
s
mind
italian
backgrounds
i
in
the
italian
devotional
pictures
of
the
early
renaissance
there
are
usually
two
quite
unrelated
parts
the
foreground
and
the
background
the
foreground
is
conventional
its
personages
saints
angels
and
holy
family
are
the
direct
descendants
of
a
long
line
of
similar
figures
every
detail
of
dress
and
attitude
has
been
settled
beforehand
by
laws
which
the
artist
accepts
as
passively
as
the
fact
that
his
models
have
two
eyes
apiece
and
noses
in
the
middle
of
their
faces
though
now
and
then
some
daring
painter
introduces
a
happy
modification
such
as
the
little
angels
on
the
steps
of
the
virgin
s
throne
in
the
pictures
of
the
venetian
school
such
changes
are
too
rare
and
unimportant
to
affect
the
general
truth
of
the
statement
it
is
only
in
the
background
that
the
artist
finds
himself
free
to
express
his
personality
here
he
depicts
not
what
some
one
else
has
long
since
designed
for
him
in
another
land
and
under
different
conceptions
of
life
and
faith
but
what
he
actually
sees
about
him
in
the
lombard
plains
in
the
tuscan
or
in
the
fantastic
serrated
landscape
of
the
friulian
alps
one
must
look
past
and
beyond
the
central
figures
in
their
typical
attitudes
and
symbolical
dress
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
life
amid
which
the
painting
originated
relegated
to
the
middle
distance
and
reduced
to
insignificant
size
is
the
real
picture
the
picture
which
had
its
birth
in
the
artist
s
brain
and
reflects
his
impression
of
the
life
about
him
here
for
instance
behind
a
madonna
of
bellini
s
white
oxen
graze
the
pasture
and
a
shepherd
lolls
on
a
bank
beside
his
flock
there
in
the
train
of
the
eastern
kings
real
soldiers
clerks
pedlars
beggars
and
all
the
miscellaneous
rabble
of
the
italian
streets
wind
down
a
crowned
by
a
mediæval
keep
and
cross
a
bridge
with
a
just
such
a
bridge
and
as
the
artist
may
have
sketched
in
his
native
village
and
in
the
scenes
of
the
life
of
the
virgin
what
opportunities
for
present
themselves
in
ghirlandaio
s
fresco
of
the
birth
of
the
virgin
in
the
apse
of
santa
maria
novella
fine
ladies
in
contemporary
costume
are
congratulating
the
saint

while
crivelli
s
annunciation
in
the
national
gallery
shows
an
ornate
renaissance
palace
with
peacocks
spreading
their
tails
on
the
upper
loggia
a
sumptuous
eastern
rug
hanging
over
a
marble
balustrade
and
the
celestial
messenger
tripping
up
a
flight
of
marble
stairs
to
a
fashionable
front
door
no
painter
was
more
prodigal
than
carpaccio
of
these
intimate
details
or
more
audacious
in
the
abrupt
juxtaposition
of
devotional
figures
with
the
bustling
secular
life
of
his
day
his
legend
of
saint
ursula
in
the
accademia
of
venice
is
a
storehouse
of
anecdote
an
encyclopædia
of
dress
architecture
and
manners
and
behind
his
agonizing
saint
sebastian
tied
to
a
column
and
riddled
with
arrows
the
traffic
of
the
venetian
canals
goes
on
unregardingly
as
in
life
the
most
trivial
activities
revolve
unheeding
about
a
great
sorrow
even
painters
far
less
independent
of
tradition
than
carpaccio
and
crivelli
succeeded
in
imparting
the
personal
note
the
note
of
direct
observation
to
the
background
of
their
religious
pictures
if
the
figures
are
placed
in
a
landscape
the
latter
is
not
a
conventional
grouping
of
hill
valley
and
river
it
has
the
unmistakable
quality
of
the
no
one
who
has
studied
the
backgrounds
of
old
italian
pictures
can
imagine
that
realistic
is
a
modern
art
the
technique
of
the
early
was
not
that
of
the
modern
interpreter
of
nature
but
their
purpose
was
the
same
they
sought
to
render
with
fidelity
and
precision
what
they
saw
about
them
it
is
this
directness
of
vision
which
gives
to
their
backgrounds
such
vividness
and
charm
in
these
distances
one
may
discover
the
actual
foreground
of
the
artist
s
life
here
one
may
learn
what
was
veritably
happening
in
venice
florence
and
perugia
here
see
what
horizons
the
old
masters
looked
out
on
and
note
that
the
general
aspect
of
the
country
is
still
almost
as
unchanged
as
the
folds
of
the
umbrian
mountains
and
the
curves
of
the
tuscan
streams
ii
as
with
the
study
of
italian
pictures
so
it
is
with
italy
herself
the
country
is
divided
not
in
but
in
two
a
foreground
and
a
background
the
foreground
is
the
property
of
the
and
of
its
product
the
mechanical
the
background
that
of
the
dawdler
the
dreamer
and
the
serious
student
of
italy
this
distinction
does
not
imply
any
depreciation
of
the
foreground
it
must
be
known
thoroughly
before
the
middle
distance
can
be
enjoyed
there
is
no
short
cut
to
an
intimacy
with
italy
nor
must
the
analogy
of
the
devotional
picture
be
pushed
too
far
the
famous
paintings
statues
and
buildings
of
italy
are
obviously
the
embodiment
of
its
historic
and
artistic
growth
but
they
have
become
slightly
conventionalized
by
being
too
long
used
as
the
terms
in
which
italy
is
defined
they
have
stiffened
into
symbols
and
the
life
of
which
they
were
once
the
most
complete
expression
has
evaporated
in
the
desiccating
to
which
their
fame
has
condemned
them
to
enjoy
them
one
must
let
in
on
them
the
open
air
of
an
observation
detached
from
tradition
since
they
can
not
be
evaded
they
must
be
deconventionalized
and
to
effect
this
they
must
be
considered
in
relation
to
the
life
of
which
they
are
merely
the
ornamental
façade
thus
regarded
to
what
an
enchanted
region
do
they
form
the
approach
like
courteous
hosts
they
efface
themselves
pointing
the
way
but
giving
their
guests
the
freedom
of
their
domain
it
is
not
too
fanciful
to
say
that
each
of
the
great
masterpieces
of
italy
holds
the
key
to
some
secret
garden
of
the
imagination
one
must
know
titian
and
giorgione
to
enjoy
the
intimacy
of
the
friulian
alps
cima
da
conegliano
to
taste
the
full
savour
of
the
strange
euganean
landscape
palladio
and
sansovino
to
appreciate
the
frivolous
of
the
brenta
nay
the
domes
of
brunelleschi
and
michael
angelo
to
feel
the
happy
curve
of
some
chapel
cupola
in
a
nameless
village
of
the
hills
une
civilisation
says
ne
peut
prétendre
posséder
un
art
que
si
cet
art
pénètre
partout
s
il
fait
sentir
sa
présence
dans
les
œuvres
les
plus
it
is
because
italian
art
so
interpenetrated
italian
life
because
the
humblest
stonemason
followed
in
some
sort
the
lines
of
the
great
architects
and
the
modeller
of
village
madonnas
the
composition
of
the
great
sculptors
that
the
monumental
foreground
and
the
unregarded
distances
behind
it
so
continually
interpret
and
expound
each
other
italy
to
her
real
lovers
is
like
a
great
illuminated
book
with
here
and
there
a
glorious
picture
and
between
these
page
after
page
of
margins
wherein
every
detail
of
her
daily
life
may
be
traced
and
the
pictures
and
the
margins
are
by
the
same
hand
iii
as
italy
is
divided
into
foreground
and
background
so
each
city
has
its
perspective
its
asterisked
for
the
hasty
traveller
its
middle
distance
for
the
happy
few
who
remain
more
than
three
days
and
its
boundless
horizon
for
the
idler
who
refuses
to
measure
art
by
time
in
some
cases
the
background
is
the
continuation
the
amplification
of
the
central
subject
in
others
its
direct
antithesis
thus
in
umbria
and
in
some
parts
of
tuscany
and
the
marches
art
architecture
history
and
landscape
all
supplement
and
continue
each
other
and
the
least
imaginative
tourist
must
feel
that
in
leaving
the
galleries
of
siena
or
florence
for
the
streets
and
the
surrounding
country
he
is
still
within
the
bounds
of
conventional
in
rome
on
the
contrary
in
milan
and
to
some
extent
in
venice
as
well
as
in
many
of
the
smaller
towns
throughout
italy
there
is
a
sharp
line
of
demarcation
between
the
city
and
its
background
in
some
cases
the
latter
is
composed
mainly
of
objects
at
which
the
tourist
has
been
taught
to
look
askance
or
rather
which
he
has
been
counselled
to
pass
by
without
a
look
goethe
has
long
been
held
up
to
the
derision
of
the
enlightened
student
of
art
because
he
went
to
assisi
to
see
the
roman
temple
of
minerva
and
omitted
to
visit
the
mediæval
church
of
saint
francis
but
how
many
modern
visit
the
church
and
omit
the
temple
and
wherein
lies
their
superior
catholicity
of
taste
the
fact
is
that
in
this
particular
instance
foreground
and
background
have
changed
places
and
the
modern
tourist
who
neglects
minerva
for
saint
francis
is
as
narrowly
bound
by
tradition
as
his
predecessor
with
this
difference
that
whereas
the
latter
knew
nothing
of
mediæval
art
and
architecture
the
modern
tourist
knows
that
the
temple
is
there
and
deliberately
turns
his
back
on
it
iv
perhaps
rome
is
of
all
italian
cities
the
one
in
which
this
of
æsthetic
interest
is
most
oddly
exemplified
in
the
tuscan
and
umbrian
cities
as
has
been
said
the
art
and
architecture
which
form
the
s
accepted
curriculum
are
still
the
distinctive
features
of
the
streets
through
which
he
walks
to
his
gallery
or
his
museum
in
florence
for
instance
he
may
go
forth
from
the
riccardi
chapel
and
see
the
castle
of
vincigliata
towering
on
its
hill
precisely
as
gozzoli
depicted
it
in
his
fresco
in
siena
the
crenellated
palaces
with
their
iron
and
barred
windows
form
the
unchanged
setting
of
a
mediæval
pageant
but
in
rome
for
centuries
it
has
been
the
fashion
to
look
only
on
a
city
which
has
almost
disappeared
and
to
close
the
eyes
to
one
which
is
still
alive
and
actual
the
student
of
ancient
rome
moves
among
débris
the
mediævalist
must
traverse
the
city
from
end
to
end
to
piece
together
the
meagre
fragments
of
his
both
studies
are
absorbing
and
the
very
difficulty
of
the
chase
no
doubt
adds
to
its
exhilaration
but
is
it
not
a
curious
mental
attitude
which
compels
the
devotee
of
mediæval
art
to
walk
blindfold
from
the
palazzo
venezia
to
santa
sabina
on
the
aventine
or
from
the
ara
cœli
to
santa
maria
sopra
minerva
because
the
great
monuments
lying
between
these
points
of
his
pilgrimage
belong
to
what
some
one
has
taught
him
to
regard
as
a
debased
period
of
art
rome
is
the
most
undisturbed
baroque
city
of
italy
the
great
revival
of
its
spiritual
and
temporal
power
coincided
with
the
development
of
that
phase
of
art
of
which
michael
angelo
sowed
the
seed
in
rome
itself
the
germs
of
bernini
and
tiepolo
must
be
sought
in
the
sistine
ceiling
and
in
the
moses
of
san
pietro
in
vincoli
however
much
the
devotees
of
michael
angelo
may
resent
the
tracing
of
such
a
lineage
but
it
is
hard
at
this
date
to
be
patient
with
any
form
of
artistic
absolutism
with
any
critical
criteria
not
based
on
that
sense
of
the
comparative
which
is
the
nineteenth
century
s
most
important
contribution
to
the
function
of
criticism
it
is
hard
to
be
tolerant
of
that
peculiar
form
of
intolerance
which
refuses
to
recognize
in
art
the
general
law
of
growth
and
transformation
or
while
recognizing
it
considers
it
a
subject
for
futile
reproach
and
lamentation
the
art
critic
must
acknowledge
a
standard
of
excellence
and
must
be
allowed
his
personal
preferences
within
the
range
of
established
criteria
æsthetically
the
world
is
divided
into
the
gothically
and
the
classically
minded
just
as
intellectually
it
is
divided
into
those
who
rise
to
the
general
idea
and
those
who
pause
at
the
particular
instance
the
lover
of
the
particular
instance
will
almost
always
have
a
taste
for
the
gothic
which
is
the
personal
and
anecdotic
in
art
carried
to
its
utmost
expression
at
the
cost
of
synthetic
effect
but
if
he
be
at
all
accessible
to
general
ideas
he
must
recognize
the
futility
of
battling
against
the
inevitable
tendencies
of
taste
and
invention
granted
that
from
his
standpoint
the
art
which
evolved
from
michael
angelo
is
an
art
of
decadence
is
that
a
reason
for
raging
at
it
or
ignoring
it
the
autumn
is
a
season
of
decadence
but
even
by
those
who
prefer
the
spring
it
has
not
hitherto
been
an
object
of
invective
and
reprobation
only
when
the
art
critic
begins
to
survey
the
modifications
of
art
as
objectively
as
he
would
study
the
alternations
of
the
seasons
will
he
begin
to
understand
and
to
sympathize
with
the
different
modes
in
which
man
has
sought
to
formulate
his
gropings
after
beauty
if
it
be
true
in
the
world
of
sentiment
that
faut
aimer
pour
the
converse
is
true
in
the
world
of
art
to
enjoy
any
form
of
artistic
expression
one
must
not
only
understand
what
it
tries
to
express
but
know
hills
where
its
life
rose
and
the
sea
where
it
thus
philosophically
viewed
the
baroque
rome
the
rome
of
bernini
borromini
and
maderna
of
guercino
the
caracci
and
claude
lorrain
becomes
of
great
interest
even
to
those
who
are
not
in
sympathy
with
the
exuberances
of
art
in
the
first
place
the
great
number
of
baroque
buildings
churches
palaces
and
villas
the
grandeur
of
their
scale
and
the
happy
incidents
of
their
grouping
give
a
better
idea
than
can
elsewhere
be
obtained
of
the
collective
effects
of
which
the
style
is
capable
thus
viewed
it
will
be
seen
to
be
essentially
a
style
the
setting
of
the
spectacular
and
external
life
which
had
developed
from
the
more
secluded
civilization
of
the
renaissance
as
some
blossom
of
immense
size
and
dazzling
colour
may
develop
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
from
a
smaller
and
more
delicate
flower
the
process
was
inevitable
and
the
result
exemplifies
the
way
in
which
new
conditions
will
generate
new
forms
of
talent
it
is
in
moments
of
social
and
artistic
transformation
that
original
genius
shows
itself
and
bernini
was
the
genius
of
the
baroque
movement
to
those
who
study
his
work
in
the
light
of
the
conditions
which
produced
it
he
will
appear
as
the
natural
interpreter
of
that
sumptuous
period
when
the
pomp
of
a
revived
ecclesiasticism
and
the
elaborate
etiquette
of
spain
were
blent
with
a
growing
taste
for
country
life
for
the
solemnities
and
amplitudes
of
nature
the
mingling
of
these
antagonistic
interests
has
produced
an
art
distinctive
enough
to
take
rank
among
the
recognized
styles
an
art
in
which
excessive
formality
and
ostentation
are
tempered
by
a
free
play
of
line
as
though
the
winds
of
heaven
swept
unhindered
through
the
heavy
draperies
of
a
palace
it
need
not
be
denied
that
delicacy
of
detail
sobriety
of
means
and
the
effect
of
repose
were
often
sacrificed
to
these
new
requirements
but
it
is
more
fruitful
to
observe
how
skilfully
bernini
and
his
best
pupils
managed
to
preserve
the
balance
and
rhythm
of
their
bold
compositions
and
how
seldom
profusion
led
to
incoherence
how
successfully
the
italian
sense
of
form
ruled
over
this
chaos
of
material
and
drew
forth
from
it
the
classic
line
may
be
judged
from
the
way
in
which
the
churches
about
the
forum
harmonize
with
the
ruins
of
ancient
rome
surely
none
but
the
most
bigoted
archæologist
would
wish
away
from
that
magic
scene
the
façades
of
san
lorenzo
in
miranda
and
of
santa
francesca
romana
in
this
connection
it
might
be
well
for
the
purist
to
consider
what
would
be
lost
if
the
rome
which
he
affects
to
ignore
were
actually
blotted
out
the
spanish
steps
would
of
course
disappear
with
the
palace
of
the
propaganda
so
would

glorious
barberini
palace
and
bernini

its
dripping

from
their
grottoes

fantastic

the
head
of

street

kaleidoscope
of
whirling
line
and
ornament
offset
by
the
delicately
classical
circular
cortile
of
the
adjoining
monastery
on
the
quirinal

the
palace
of
the

go

enumeration
includes
but
a
small
number
of
the
baroque
buildings

rome

the
villas
encircling
the
city
have
not
been
named
though
nearly
all
with
their
unmatched
gardens
are
due
to
the
art
of
this
debased
period
but
let
the
candid
even
he
who
has
no
tolerance
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
to
whom
each
of
the
buildings
may
be
individually
an
object
of
reprobation
let
even
this
sectary
of
art
ask
himself
how
much
of
mighty
splendent
rome
would
be
left
were
it
possible
to
obliterate
the
buildings
erected
during
the
fever
of
architectural
renovation
which
raged
from
the
accession
of
sixtus
v
to
the
last
years
of
the
seventeenth
century
whether
or
no
he
would
deplore
the
loss
of
any
one
of
these
buildings
he
would
be
constrained
to
own
that
collectively
they
go
far
toward
composing
the
physiognomy
of
the
rome
he
loves
so
was
the
architectural
renascence
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
so
vast
were
the
opportunities
afforded
to
its
chief
exponents
that
every
quarter
of
the
ancient
city
is
saturated
with
the
spirit
of
bernini
and
borromini
some
may
think
that
rome
itself
is
the
best
defence
of
the
baroque
that
an
art
which
could
so
envelop
without
eclipsing
the
mighty
monuments
amid
which
it
was
called
to
work
which
could
give
expression
to
a
brilliant
present
without
jarring
on
a
warlike
or
ascetic
past
which
could
in
short
fuse
imperial
and
early
christian
rome
with
the
city
of
spanish
ceremonial
and
piety
needs
no
better
justification
than
the
of
wren
but
even
those
who
remain
unconverted
who
can
not
effect
the
transference
of
artistic
and
historic
sympathy
necessary
to
a
real
understanding
of
architecture
should
at
least
realize
that
the
rome
which
excites
a
passion
of
devotion
such
as
no
other
city
can
inspire
the
rome
for
which
travellers
pine
in
absence
and
to
which
they
return
again
and
again
with
the
fresh
ardour
of
discovery
is
externally
at
least
in
great
part
the
creation
of
the
seventeenth
century
v
in
venice
the
foreground
is
with
an
admixture
of
early
renaissance
it
extends
from
the
church
of
torcello
to
the
canvases
of
tintoretto
this
foreground
has
been
celebrated
in
literature
with
a
vehemence
and
profusion
which
have
projected
it
still
farther
into
the
public
consciousness
and
more
completely
obscured
the
fact
that
there
is
another
venice
a
background
venice
the
venice
of
the
eighteenth
century
venice
was
not
always
thus
relegated
to
the
background
it
had
its
day
when
tourists
pronounced
saint
mark
s
an
example
of
the
barbarous
gothick
and
were
better
acquainted
with
the
ridotto
of
san
moisè
than
with
the
monuments
of
the
frari
it
is
instructive
to
note
that
the
venice
of
that
day
had
no
galleries
and
no
museums
travellers
did
not
go
there
to
be
edified
but
to
be
amused
and
one
may
fancy
with
what
relief
the
young
nobleman
on
the
grand
tour
sated
with
the
marbles
of
rome
and
the
canvases
of
parma
and
bologna
turned
aside
for
a
moment
to
a
city
where
enjoyment
was
the
only
art
and
life
the
only
object
of
study
but
while
travellers
were
flocking
to
venice
to
see
its
carnival
and
its
public
festivals
and
private
a
generation
of
artists
were
at
work
brushing
in
the
gay
background
of
the
scene
and
quiet
hands
were
recording
in
a
series
of
memorable
little
pictures
every
phase
of
that
last
brilliant
ebullition
of
the
de

the

his

were
the

the

who
captured
every

with
such
delicacy
and
precision
that
under
their

the
glittering
venice
of
the
toccata
of
galuppi
lies
outspread
like
a
butterfly
with
the
bloom
on
its
wings
externally
venice
did
not
undergo
the
same
renovation
as
rome
as
she
was
at
the
close
of
the
renaissance
with
the
impress
of
palladio
and
sansovino
on
her
religious
and
secular
architecture
so
she
remains
to
this
day
one
original

baldassare
longhena
struck
the
note
of
a
brilliant

the
churches
of
santa
maria
della
salute
and
the
scalzi
and
in
the
pesaro
and
rezzonico
palaces
on
the
grand
canal
and
his
pupils
developing
his
manner
with
infinitely
less
talent
gave
to
venice
the
long
squat
dogana
with
its
flying
fortune
fronting
the
lagoon
the
churches
of
santa

zobenigo
san

and
the
gesuiti
the
monte
di

and
a
score
of
imposing

the
main
effect
of
the
city
was
however
little
modified
by
this
brief
flowering
of
the
baroque
venice
has
always
stamped
every
new
fashion
with
her
own
personality
and
longhena
s
architecture
seems
merely
the
efflorescence
of
the
style
of
sansovino
and
scamozzi
being
moreover
less
under
the
sway
of
the
church
than
any
other
italian
state

was
able
to
resist

with
which

clad

their

by
erecting
the
sumptuous
church
of

its
palatial
interior

one
may
well

longhena
about

so
identified
with
the
genius
of
tiepolo
that
it
may
be
regarded
as
an
epitome
of
venetian
art
herr
cornelius
gurlitt
the
most
penetrating
critic
of
the
venetian
baroque
has
indeed
justly
pointed
out
that
longhena
was
the
forerunner
and
of
the
great
master
of
decorative
painting
and
that
the
architect
s
bold
and
sumptuous
structural
effects
might
have
been
designed
as
a
setting
for
those
unsurpassed
audacities
of
the
brush
which
a
hundred
years
later
were
to
continue
and
complete
them
on
the
soaring
vault
of
the
scalzi
above
an
interior
of
almost
palladian
elegance
and
severity
the
great
painter
of
atmosphere
the
first
of
the
was
required
to
depict
the
transportation
of
the
holy
house
from
palestine
to
loreto
that
tiepolo
with
his
love
of
ethereal
distances
and
of
hues
melting
into
thin
air
should
have
accepted
the
task
of
representing
a
stone
house
borne
through
the
sky
by
angels
shows
a
rare
sense
of
mastery
that
he
achieved
the
feat
without
disaster
justifies
the
audacity
of
the
attempt
tiepolo
was
above
all
a
lover
of
open
spaces
he
liked
to
suspend
his
fluttering
groups
in
great
pellucid
reaches
of
sky
and
the
vast
ceiling
of
the
scalzi
gave
him
an
exceptional
opportunity
for
the
development
of
this
effect
the
result
is
that
the
angels
whirling
along
the
virgin
s
house
with
a
vehemence
which
makes
it
seem
a
mere
feather
in
the
rush
of
their
flight
appear
to
be
sweeping
through
measureless
heights
of
air
above
an
unroofed
building
the
architectural
propriety
of
such
a
l
is
not
only
open
to
criticism
but
perhaps
quite
indefensible
yet
given
the
demand
for
this
particular
illusion
who
but
tiepolo
could
have
produced
it
the
same
ethereal
effect
but
raised
to
a
higher
heaven
of
translucency
is
to
be
found
in
the
ceiling
of
the
gesuati
not
to
be
confounded
with
the

the

this
charming
structure
built
in
the
early
eighteenth
century

pupils
of

but
obviously
inspired
by
the
great
churches
of

dedicated
to

the

and

in
three
incomparable
frescoes

represented
on
its

legend
of

the
chaplet
from

the
alert

careful
to
point
out
that
the
mother
of
god
bending
from
her
starry
throne
above
the
ecstatic
saint
looks
like
a
noble
venetian
lady
of
the
painter
s
day
no
doubt
she
does
it
is
impossible
to
form
an
intelligent
estimate
of
tiepolo
s
genius
without
remembering
that
the
catholicism
of
his
time
was
a
religion
of
which
aimed
to
make
its
noble
devotees
as
much
at
home
in
church
as
in
the
he
took
his
models
from
real
life
and
composed
his
celestial
scenes
without
much
thought
of
their
inner
significance
yet
by
sheer
force
of
technique
he
contrived
to
impart
to
his
great
religious
pictures
a
glow
of
supernatural
splendour
which
makes
it
not
inapt
to
apply
to
them
the
lines
of
the
paradiso
la
luce
divina

penetrante
per
l
universo
secondo
ch
è
degno
sichè
nulla
le
puote
essere
vi
it
is
quite
true
however
that
tiepolo
was
not
primarily
a
devotional
painter
he
was
first
of
all
a
great
decorative
artist
a
master
of
emotion
in
motion
and
it
probably
mattered
little
to
him
whether
he
was
called
on
to
express
the
passion
of
saint
theresa
or
of
cleopatra
this
does
not
imply
that
he
executed
his
task
indifferently
whatever
it
was
he
threw
into
it
the
whole
force
of
his
vehement
imagination
and
incomparable
but
what
he
saw
in
it
whether
it
was
religious
or
worldly
was
chiefly
no
doubt
the
opportunity
to
obtain
new
effects
of
light
and
line
if
he
had
a
special
bent
it
was
perhaps
toward
the
depicting
of
worldly
pageants
in
the
labia
palace
on
the
canareggio
a
building
in
which
cominelli
the
ablest
venetian
architect
of
the
eighteenth
century
nobly
continued
the
grand
manner
of
sansovino
and
scamozzi
tiepolo
found
an
unequalled
opportunity
for
the
exercise
of
this
side
of
his
talent
here
in
the
lofty
saloon
of
the
he
painted
the
loves
of
antony
and
cleopatra
transposed
to
the
key
of
modern
patrician
life
he
first
covered
the
walls
with
an
architectural
improvisation
of
porticoes

and
colonnades
which
might
have
been
erected
to
celebrate
the
triumph
of
some
magnificent
este
or

in
this
splendid
setting
he
placed
two
great
scenes

their

of

may
recall

presence

venetians

scene

suggests
with
curious
vividness
the

where
they
come

triple

of

world
transformed
into

and
one
can
almost
hear
the
golden
antony
as
he
brushes
aside
the
importunate
roman

whispering
to
his
queen

sport
still
more
shakespearian

the
scene
of

at

goblet

her
smile

summed
up
all
the
cruel
grace
of
the
false
soul
of
it
is
tiepolo
s
best
praise
that
such
phrases
and
associations
as
these
are
evoked
by
his
art
and
that
judged
from
the
painter
s
standpoint
it
recalls
the
glory
of
another
great
tradition
studied
in
the
light
of
venetian
painting
tiepolo
is
seen
to
be
the
direct
descendant
of

the
intervening
century
has
taken
something
from
the
warmth
of
his
colour
leaving
it
too
often
chalky

of

vii
it
is
perhaps
no
longer
accurate
to
describe
tiepolo
as
forming
a
part
of
the
venetian
background
recent
criticism
has
advanced
him
to
the
middle
distance
and
if
there
are
still
comparatively
few
who
know
his
work
his
name
is
familiar
to
the
cultivated
minority
of
travellers
far
behind
him
however
still
on
the
of
the
tourist
s
horizon
are
the
other
figures
of
the
venetian
background
longhi

and
their
humbler
understudies
of
these
canaletto
alone
emerges
into
relative
prominence
his
views
of
venice
are
to
be
found
in
so
many
european
galleries
and
his
name
so
facilitates
the
association
of
ideas
that
if
few
appreciate
his
work
many
are
superficially
acquainted
with
it
whereas
guardi
a
painter
of
greater
though
more
unequal
talent
is
still
known
only
to
the
dilettante
the
work
of
both
is
invaluable
as
a
document
for
the
study
of
venice
but
while
canaletto
in
his
charming
canvases
represented
only
the
superficial
and
obvious
aspect
of
the
city
as
it
might
appear
to
any
appreciative
stranger
guardi
one
of
the
earliest
impressionists

the
real
life
of

of

up

wide
black

of
a

the
ruffled
green
waters
of
the
canalazzo
far
beneath
these
two
men
in
talent
but
invaluable
as
a
chronicler
of
venetian
life
is
canaletto
s
bellotti
who
in
a
stiff
topographical
manner
has
faithfully
and
minutely
recorded
every
detail
of
life
on
the
canals
being
of
interest
only
to
the
student
of
manners
he
is
seldom
represented
in
the
public
galleries
but
many
private
collections
in
the
north
of
italy
contain
a
series
of
his
pictures
giving
all
the
venetian
festivals
from
the
marriage
of
the
adriatic
to
the
great
feat
of
the
which
took
place
in
the

last
thursday

lent
as
unknown
to
the
general
public
as
bellotti
but
more
sought
after
by
connoisseurs
than
any
other
italian
artist
of
the
eighteenth
century
save
tiepolo
is
pietro
longhi
the
whose
exquisite
little
transcripts
of
venetian
domestic
life
now
fetch
their
weight
in
gold
at
christie
s
or
the
hôtel
drouot
longhi
s
talent
is
a
peculiar
one
to
taste
him
as
the
french
say
one
must
understand
the
fundamental
naïveté
of
that
brilliant
and
corrupt
venetian
society
as
it
is
revealed
in
the
comedies
of
goldoni
and
in
the
memoirs
of
contemporary
writers
the
venetians
were
in
fact
amoral
rather
than
immoral
there
was
nothing
complex
or
morbid
in
their
vice
it
was
hardly
vice
at
all
in
the
sense
which
implies
the
deliberate
saying
of
evil
be
thou
my
venetian
immorality
was
a
mere
yielding
to
natural
instincts
to
the
de
of
a
gay
and
sensuous
temperament
there
was
no
intellectual
depravity
in
venice
because
there
was
hardly
any
intellect
there
was
no
thought
of
evil
because
there
was
no
thought
the
fashionable
sinners
whom
posterity
has
pictured
as
revelling
in
the
complexities
of
vice
sat
enchanted
before
the
simple
scenes
of
goldoni
s
drama
and
the
equally
simple
pictures
of
their
favourite
nor
must
it
be
thought
that
this
taste
for
simplicity
and
innocence
was
evidence
of
a
subtler
perversion
the
french
profligate
sought
in
imagination
the
contrast
of
an
ideal
world
the
milk
and
world
of
gessner
s
idylls
and
the
de
but
goldoni
and
longhi
are
not
idealists
or
even
sentimentalists
they
draw
with
a
frank
hand
the
life
of
their
day
from
the
fisherman
s
hut
to
the
patrician
s
palace
nothing
can
be
more
unmistakable
than
the
realism
of
goldoni
s
dialect
plays
and
a
people
who
could
enjoy
such
simple
pictures
of
the
life
about
them
must
in
a
sense
have
led
simple
lives
themselves
longhi
s
record
every
phase
of
venetian
and
aristocratic
existence
to
some
indeed
it
is
difficult
to
find
a
clue
and
it
has
been
conjectured
that
these
represent
scenes
from
the
popular
comedies
of
the
day
the
others
depict
such
incidents
as
the
visit
to
the
convent
parlour
where
the
nuns
are
entertaining
their
gallants
with
a
the
masked

the

walking

she
is

admirers

hippopotamus
in
his
tent
in
the
piazzetta
the
the
the
and
a
hundred
other
episodes
of
social
and
domestic
life
the
personages
who
take
part
in
these
scenes
are
always
of
one
type
the
young
women
with
small
oval
faces
powdered
but
unrouged
with
red
lips
and
sloping
foreheads
the
men
in
cloaks
and
masks
or
gay
embroidered
coats
with
square
brows
and
rather
snub
features
gallant
flourishing
but
never
in
the
least
idealized
or
sentimentalized
the
scenes
of
high
life
take
place
for
the
most
part
in
tall
bare
rooms
with
stone
a
family
portrait
of
a
doge
or
an
admiral
above
the
and
a
few
stiff
of
the
heavy
venetian
baroque
there
is
nothing
sumptuous
in
the
furnishing
of
the
apartments
or
in
the
dress
of
their
inmates
the
ladies
if
they
are
going
abroad
or
paying
a
visit
wear
a
hat
above
the
black
lace
which
hides
their
hair
and
the
lower
part
of
the
face
while
their
dresses
are
covered
by
the
black
silk
or
domino
indoors
they
are
attired
in
simple
short
gowns
of
silk
or
brocade
with
a
kerchief
on

a
rose
or
a
in

unpowdered

that
pleasure
in
the
painting
of
gorgeous
stuffs
and
in
all
the
material
splendours
of
life
derived
by
tiepolo
from
his
great
predecessors
of
the
renaissance
was
not
shared
by
longhi
his
charm
lies
in
a
less
definable
quality
a
quality
of
unstudied
simplicity
and
naturalness
which
gives
to
his
the
value
of
actual
transcripts
from
life
one
feels
that
he
did
not
arrange
his
scenes
any
more
than
goldoni
constructed
his
comedies
both
were
content
to
reflect
in
the
mirror
of
a
quietly
humorous
observation
the
incidents
of
the
piazza
the
convent
and
the
palace
the
fact
that
longhi
in
his
sought
so
little
variety
of
grouping
and
was
content
to
limit
his
figures
to
so
small
a
range
of
gestures
has
given
rise
to
the
idea
that
he
was
incapable
of
versatility
and
breadth
of
composition
to
be
undeceived
on
this
point
however
one
has
only
to
see
his
frescoes
in
the
palazzo
grassi
now
sina
on
the
grand
canal
this
fine
palace
built
about
by
massari
the
architect
of
the
gesuati
has
a
magnificent
double
stairway
leading
from
the
colonnaded
court
to
the
state
apartments
above
and
on
the
walls
of
this
stairway
longhi
for
once
laying
aside
his
small
canvases
and
simple
methods
has
depicted
in
a
series
of
groups
the
members
of
the
grassi
family
leaning
over
a
marble
balustrade
to
see
their
guests
ascending
the
stairs
the
variety
of
these
groups
the
expressiveness
of
the
faces
and
the
general
breadth
of
treatment
prove
that
longhi
had
far
more
technical
and
imaginative
power
than
he
chose
to
put
into
his
little
pictures
and
that
his
naïveté
was
a
matter
of
choice
probably
no
one
who
knows
his
work
regrets
this
limitation
additional
movement
and
complexity
of
grouping
would
destroy
the
sense
of
leisure
of
spacious
rooms
and
ample
time
of
that
absence
of
hurry
and
confusion
so
typical
of
a
society
untroubled
by
moral
responsibilities
or
social
rivalries
and
pursuing
pleasure
with
the
calmness
which
was
one
of
the
most
charming
traits
obliterated
by
the
french
revolution
viii
on
a
quiet
canal
not
far
from
the
church
of
the
frari
there
stands
an
old
palace
where
in
a
series
of
undisturbed
rooms
may
be
seen
the
very
setting
in
which
the
personages
of
goldoni
and
longhi
played
out
their
social
comedy
the
palazzo
was
bequeathed
to
the
city
of
venice
some
fifty
years
since
by
the
last
count
querini
and
with
its
gallery
its
library
and
its
private
apartments
has
since
then
stood
open
to
a
public
which
never
visits
it
yet
here
the
student
of
venetian
backgrounds
may
find
the
unchanged
atmosphere
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
gallery
besides
some
good
paintings
of
earlier
schools
contains
a
large
collection
of
bellotti
s
pictures
representing
all
the
great
religious
and
popular
festivals
of
venice
as
well
as
a
longhis
and
a
charming
series
of
by
unknown
artists
of
his
school
of
far
greater
interest
however
are
the
private
apartments
with
their
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
century
decorations
still
intact
and
the
walls
lined
with
the
heavy
baroque
consoles
and
so
familiar
to
students
of
longhi
s
interiors
and
of
the
charming
prints
in
the
first
edition
of
goldoni
here
is
the
typical
de

its
damask
curtains
and
and
its
furniture
painted
with
flowers
on
a
ground
of

tapestried
saloon
with
its
murano
chandeliers
the
boudoir
with
panels
set
in
delicately
carved
and

of
flowers
and
foliage
and
the
hung
with
pictures
of
the
three
great
querini

doge

the
long
gallery

a
bust
of
the

church
surrounded
by
marble
effigies
of
his

a
series
of
berniniesque
heads
of
remarkable
vigour
and
individuality
from
that
of
the
hoary
scoundrel
with
drooping
over
an
evil
scowl
to
the
smooth
young
villain
with
bare
throat
and
insolent
stare
who
seems
to
glory
in
his
own
sinister
beauty
these
busts
give
an
insight
into
a
different
phase
of
italian
life
the
life
of
the
violent
and
tragical
seventeenth
century
when
every
great
personage
in
the
church
no
less
than
in
the
world
had
his
bodyguard
of
hardened
criminals
outlaws
and
who
received
sanctuary
in
their
patron
s
palace
and
performed
in
return
such
acts
of
villany
and
violence
as
the
illustrissimo
required
it
seems
a
far
cry
from
the
peaceable
world
of
goldoni
and
longhi
to
this
prelate
surrounded
by
the
effigies
of
his
hired
assassins
yet
though
no
longer
openly
acknowledged
or
immortalized
in
marble
lurked
in
the
background
of
italian
life
as
late
as
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
stendhal
who
knew
italy
as
few
foreigners
have
known
it
declares
that
in
his
day
the
great
lombard
nobles
still
had
their
retinue
of
as
the
knights
of
the
stiletto
were
called
in
the
milanese
it
is
not
in
art
only
that

commemorated
lovers
of

the
one

not
soon
forget
the
followers
of
don
rodrigo
and
an
idea
of
the
part
they
played
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
may
be
obtained
from
the
pages
of
ippolito
nievo
s
confessioni
di
un
ottuagenario
that
delightful
book
half
romance
half
autobiography
which
after
many
years
of
incredible
neglect
has
just
been
republished
in
italy
ippolito
nievo
one
of
garibaldi
s
young
soldiers
was
among
those
who
perished
in
the
wreck
of
the
on
the
return
from
palermo
in
he
was
but
at
the
time
of
his
death
and
it
is
said
that
his
impatience
to
see
a
lady
to
whom
he
was
attached
caused
him
despite
the
entreaties
of
his
friends
to
take
passage
in
the
notoriously
unseaworthy
four
years
earlier
he
had
written
the
confessioni
a
volume
which
for
desultory
charm
and
simple
rendering
of
domestic
incidents
is
not
unworthy
to
take
rank
with
dichtung
und
wahrheit
while
its
capricious
heroine
la
pisana
is
as
vivid
a
creation
as
goethe
s
philina
or
one
had
almost
said
as
the
beatrix
of
thackeray
ippolito
nievo
was
himself
a
native
of
the
veneto
and
intimately
acquainted
through
family
tradition
with
the
life
of
the
small
towns
and
of
the
venetian
mainland
at
the
close
of
the
eighteenth
century
the

picture
the
life
of
a
young
lad
in
a
nobleman
s
castle
near
the
town
of
portogruaro
and
later
in
venice
and
not
the
least
remarkable
thing
about
the
book
is
the
fact
that
at
a
period
when
other
italian
novelists
were
depicting
the
adventures
of
mediæval
knights
and
ladies
its
young
author
discarding
the
old
of
romanticism
should
have
set
himself
to
recording
with
the
wealth
of
detail
and
quiet
humour
of
a
dutch
the
manners
and
customs
of
his
own
little
corner
of
italy
as
his
parents
had
described
it
to
him
nievo
s
account
of
the
provincial
nobles
in
the
veneto
shows
that
to
the
very
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
mediæval
customs
with
all
their
violence
and
treachery
prevailed
within
a
day
s
journey
of
polished
and
peaceful
venice
his
nobles
in
their
fortified
castles
of
which
the
drawbridges
are
still
raised
at
night
have
their
little
trains
of
composed
in
general
of
the
tattered
peasantry
on
their
estates
but
sometimes
of
professional
fighters
smugglers
or
outlaws
who
have
been
taken
into
the
service
of
some
truculent
lord
of
the
manor
and
nievo
describes
with
much
humour
the
conflicts
between
these
little
armies
and
the
ruses
plots
and
negotiations
of
their
quarrelsome
masters
in
another
novel
published
at
about
the
same
time
pietro
scudo
a
venetian
who
wrote
in
french
has
drawn
with
far
less
talent
a
picture
of
another
side
of
venetian
life
the
life
of
the
musical
schools
and
the
opera
which
george
sand
had
attempted
to
represent
in
scudo
s
book
le
chevalier
sarti
has
fallen
into
not
unmerited
oblivion
it
is
written
in
the
insipid
style
of
the
romantic
period
that
style
which
flaubert
in
a
moment
of
exasperation
described
as
les
embêtements
bleuâtres
du
lyrisme
poitrinaire
and
its
heroine
like
châteaubriand
s
unhappy
madame
de
beaumont
dies
of
the
fashionable
ailment
of
the
day
maladie
de
the
book
moreover
is
badly
constructed
to
the
verge
of
incoherence
and
the
characters
are
the
stock
mannikins
of
romantic
fiction
yet
in
spite
of
these
defects
scudo
has
succeeded
where
george
sand
failed
in
reproducing
the
atmosphere
of
venice
he
has
done
this
not
by
force
of
talent
but
by
the
patient
accumulation
of
detail
though
not
the
most
important
feature
in
the
construction
of
a
good
historical
novel
this
is
an
essential
part
of
the
process
george
sand
however
was
above
such
humble
methods
totally
lacking
in
artistic
sensibility
and
in
its
accompanying
faculty
the
historic
imagination
she
was
obliged
to
confine
herself
to
the
vaguest
generalities
in
describing
scenes
and
manners
so
alien
to
the
romantic
conception
of
life
nature
and
passion
were
the
only
things
which
interested
her
and
in
the
venice
of
the
eighteenth
century
there
was
no
nature
and
little
passion
hence
the
venetian
scenes
of
consuelo
give
the
impression
of
having
been
done
while
scudo
s
bear
the
impress
of
an
unimaginative
accuracy
in
le
chevalier
sarti
the
lover
of
decadent
venice
will
find
innumerable
curious
details
descriptions
of
life
in
the
villas
of
the
brenta
of
concerts
in
the
famous
scuole
carnival
scenes
at
the
ridotto
and
at
the
orto
di
san
stefano
the
favourite
resort
of
the
world
of
gallantry
while
the
minor
characters
of
the
book
who
have
escaped
the
obligatory
romanticism
of
the
hero
and
heroine
help
to
make
up
the
crowded
picture
of
a
world
as
bright
and
brittle
as
a
murano
glass
ix
but
it
is
after
all
not
in
nievo
or
scudo
nor
even
in
longhi
and
goldoni
that
one
comes
closest
to
the
vanished
venice
of
the
eighteenth
century
in
the
museo
correr
on
the
grand
canal
there
has
recently
been
opened
a
room
containing
an
assemblage
of
mannikins
dressed
in
the
various
costumes
of
the
here
are
the
senator
the
proud
procuratessa
in
brocade
and
murano
lace
the
abatino
in
his
plum
coloured
taffeta
coat
and
black
the
fashionable
reveller
in
and
mask
the
lacquey
in
livery
of
silk
the
lawyer
the
gondolier
the
groom
and
the
noble
marquess
in
his
of
white
buckskin
surely
nowhere
else
does
one
come
into
such
actual
contact
with
that
little
world
which
was
so
essentially
a
world
of
of
fine
clothes
gay
colours
and
graceful
courtly
attitudes
the
mannikins
indeed
are
not
graceful
the
cavaliere
leandro
can
no
longer
execute
a
sweeping
bow
at
the
approach
of
the
procuratessa
or
slip
a
into
the
muff
of
the
charming
angelica
the
senator
may
stare
as
haughtily
as
he
pleases
at
the
abate
and
the
lawyer
without
compelling
those
humble
clients
to
stir
an
inch
from
his
path
and
the
noble
marquess
in
his
spotless
buckskin
leggings
and
gauntlets
will
never
again
be
off
to
shoot
thrushes
from
a
in
the
euganeans
but
the
very
rigidity
of
their
once
supple
joints
seems
an
allegory
of
their
latter
state
there
they
stand
poor
dolls
of
destiny
discarded
playthings
of
the
gods
in
attitudes
of
puzzled
wonder
as
if
arrested
in
their
revels
by
the
stroke
of
the
dread
corsican
magician
for
it
was
not
death
but
napoleon
who
stepped
tacitly
and
took
them
from
the
plots
and
pleasures
the
sunshine
and
music
of
the
canals
to
that
pale
world
of
oblivion
where
only
now
and
then
some
dreamer
curious
of
the
day
of
little
things
revisits
their
melancholy
ghosts
