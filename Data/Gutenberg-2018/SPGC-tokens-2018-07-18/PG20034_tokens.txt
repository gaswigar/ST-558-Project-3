the
death
bogle
of
the

and
the
inextinguishable
candle
of
the
old
white
house
pitlochry
several
years
ago
bent
on
revisiting
perthshire
a
locality
which
had
great
attractions
for
me
as
a
boy
i
answered
an
advertisement
in
a
popular
ladies
weekly
as
far
as
i
can
recollect
it
was
somewhat
to
this
effect
comfortable
home
offered
to
a
gentleman
a
bachelor
at
moderate
terms
in
an
elderly
highland
lady
house
at
pitlochry
must
be
a
strict
teetotaller
and
box
the
naïveté
and
originality
of
the
advertisement
pleased
me
the
idea
of
obtaining
as
a
boarder
a
young
man
combining
such
virtues
as
abstinence
from
alcohol
and
tobacco
amused
me
vastly
and
then
a
bachelor
too
did
she
mean
to
make
love
to
him
herself
the
sly
old
thing
she
took
care
to
insert
the
epithet
elderly
in
order
to
avoid
suspicion
and
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
she
thirsted
for
matrimony
being
tabooed
by
all
the
men
who
had
even
as
much
as
caught
a
passing
glimpse
of
her
this
was
her
last
resource
she
would
entrap
some
unwary
stranger
a
man
with
money
of
course
and
inveigle
him
into
marrying
her
and
there
rose
up
before
me
visions
of
a
tall
angular
scottish
spinster
with
high
virulent
sandy
hair
and
brawny
arms
the
sort
of
woman
that
ought
not
to
have
been
a
woman
at
all
the
sort
that
sets
all
my
teeth
on
edge
yet
it
was
pitlochry
heavenly
pitlochry
and
there
was
no
one
else
advertising
in
that
town
that
i
should
suit
her
in
every
respect
but
the
matrimonial
i
did
not
doubt
i
can
pass
muster
in
any
company
as
a
teetotaller
i
abominate
tobacco
leastways
it
abominates
me
which
amounts
to
much
about
the
same
thing
and
i
am
or
rather
i
can
be
tolerably
amenable
if
my
surroundings
are
not
positively
infernal
and
there
are
no
county
council
children
within
shooting
distance
but
for
once
my
instincts
were
all
wrong
the
advertiser
a
miss
flora
macdonald
of
donald
murray
house
did
resemble
my
preconception
of
her
in
any
respect
she
was
of
medium
height
and
dainty
build
a
creature
clad
in
rustling
silks
with
wavy
white
hair
bright
blue
eyes
straight
delicate
features
and
hands
the
shape
and
slenderness
of
which
at
once
pronounced
her
a
psychic
she
greeted
me
with
all
the
stately
courtesy
of
the
old
school
my
portmanteau
was
taken
upstairs
by
a
lad
in
the
macdonald
tartan
and
the
tea
bell
rang
me
down
to
a
most
appetising
repast
of
strawberries
and
cream
scones
and
delicious
buttered
toast
i
fell
in
love
with
my
hostess
it
would
be
sheer
sacrilege
to
designate
such
a
divine
creature
by
the
vulgar
term
of
landlady
at
once
when
one
impressions
of
a
place
are
at
first
exalted
they
are
often
later
on
apt
to
become
equally
abased
in
this
case
however
it
was
otherwise
my
appreciation
both
of
miss
flora
macdonald
and
of
her
house
daily
increased
the
food
was
all
that
could
be
desired
and
my
bedroom
sweet
with
the
perfume
of
jasmine
and
roses
presented
such
a
picture
of
dainty
cleanliness
as
awakened
in
me
feelings
of
shame
that
it
should
be
defiled
by
all
my
dusty
accoutrements
i
flatter
myself
that
miss
macdonald
liked
me
also
that
she
did
not
regard
me
altogether
as
one
of
the
common
herd
was
doubtless
in
some
degree
due
to
the
fact
that
she
was
a
jacobite
and
in
a
discussion
on
the
associations
of
her
romantic
namesake
flora
macdonald
with
perthshire
it
leaked
out
that
our
respective
ancestors
had
commanded
battalions
in
louis
xiv
scottish
and
irish
brigades
that
discovery
bridged
gulfs
we
were
no
longer
payer
and
paid
we
were
friends
friends
for
life
a
lump
comes
into
my
throat
as
i
pen
these
words
for
it
is
only
a
short
time
since
i
heard
of
her
death
a
week
or
so
after
i
had
settled
in
her
home
i
took
at
her
suggestion
a
rest
and
i
quite
agree
with
her
it
was
a
very
necessary
rest
from
my
writing
and
spent
the
day
on
loch
tay
leaving
again
for
donald
murray
house
at
seven
in
the
evening
it
was
a
brilliant
moonlight
night
not
a
cloud
in
the
sky
and
the
landscape
stood
out
almost
as
clearly
as
in
the
daytime
i
cycled
and
after
a
hard
but
thoroughly
enjoyable
spell
of
pedalling
eventually
came
to
a
standstill
on
the
high
road
a
mile
or
two
from
the
first
lights
of
pitlochry
i
halted
not
through
fatigue
for
i
was
almost
as
fresh
as
when
i
started
but
because
i
was
entranced
with
the
delightful
atmosphere
and
wanted
to
draw
in
a
few
really
deep
draughts
of
it
before
turning
into
bed
my
was
on
a
triangular
plot
of
grass
at
the
junction
of
four
roads
i
propped
my
machine
against
a
hedge
and
stood
with
my
back
leaning
against
a
and
my
face
in
the
direction
whence
i
had
come
i
remained
in
this
attitude
for
some
minutes
probably
ten
and
was
about
to
remount
my
bicycle
when
i
suddenly
became
icy
cold
and
a
frightful
hideous
terror
seized
and
gripped
me
so
hard
that
the
machine
slipping
from
my
palsied
hands
fell
to
the
ground
with
a
crash
the
next
instant
something
for
the
life
of
me
i
knew
not
what
its
outline
was
so
blurred
and
indefinite
alighted
on
the
open
space
in
front
of
me
with
a
soft
thud
and
remained
standing
as
bolt
upright
as
a
cylindrical
pillar
from
afar
off
there
then
came
the
low
rumble
of
wheels
which
momentarily
grew
in
intensity
until
there
thundered
into
view
a
waggon
weighed
down
beneath
a
monstrous
stack
of
hay
on
the
top
of
which
sat
a
man
in
a
straw
hat
engaged
in
a
deep
confabulation
with
a
boy
in
corduroys
who
sprawled
beside
him
the
horse
catching
sight
of
the
motionless
thing
opposite
me
at
once
stood
still
and
snorted
violently
the
man
cried
out
hey
hey
what
the
matter
with
ye
beast
and
then
in
an
hysterical
kind
of
screech
great
god
what
yon
figure
that
i
see
what
yon
figure
tammas
the
boy
immediately
raised
himself
into
a
kneeling
position
and
clutching
hold
of
the
man
arm
screamed
i
dinna
ken
i
dinna
ken
matthew
but
take
heed
mon
it
does
na
touch
me
it
me
it
come
after
na
ye
the
moonlight
was
so
strong
that
the
faces
of
the
speakers
were
revealed
to
me
with
extraordinary
vividness
and
their
horrified
expressions
were
even
more
startling
than
was
the
silent
ghastly
figure
of
the
unknown
the
scene
comes
back
to
me
here
in
my
little
room
in
norwood
with
its
every
detail
as
clearly
marked
as
on
the
night
it
was
first
enacted
the
long
range
of
mountains
darkly
silhouetted
against
the
silvery
sky
and
seemingly
hushed
in
gaping
expectancy
the
shining
scaly
surface
of
some
tarn
or
river
perceptible
only
at
intervals
owing
to
the
thick
clusters
of
gently
nodding
pines
the
walls
of
cottages
glistening
amid
the
dark
green
denseness
of
the
thickly
leaved
box
trees
and
the
light
feathery
foliage
of
the
golden
laburnum
the
undulating
meadows
besprinkled
with
gorse
and
grotesquely
moulded
crags
of
granite
the
white
the
dazzling
white
roads
saturated
with
moonbeams
all
all
were
overwhelmed
with
stillness
the
stillness
that
belongs
and
belongs
only
to
the
mountains
and
trees
and
plains
the
stillness
of
shadowland
i
even
counted
the
buttons
the
horn
buttons
on
the
rustics
coats
one
was
missing
from
the
man
two
from
the
boy
and
i
even
noted
the
under
the
armpits
of
matthew
shirt
and
the
dents
and
tears
in
tammas
soft
wideawake
i
observed
all
these
trivialities
and
more
besides
i
saw
the
abrupt
rising
and
falling
of
the
man
chest
as
his
breath
came
in
sharp
jerks
the
stream
of
dirty
saliva
that
oozed
from
between
his
lips
and
dribbled
down
his
chin
i
saw
their
hands
the
man
shining
with
perspiration
and
clutching
grimly
at
the
reins
the
boy
smaller
and
if
anything
rather
more
grimy
the
one
pressed
flat
down
on
the
hay
the
other
extended
in
front
of
him
the
palm
stretched
outwards
and
all
the
fingers
widely
apart
and
while
these
minute
particulars
were
being
driven
into
my
soul
the
cause
of
it
all
the
indefinable
esoteric
column
stood
silent
and
motionless
the
hedge
a
baleful
glow
emanating
from
it
the
horse
suddenly
broke
the
spell
dashing
its
head
forward
it
broke
off
at
a
gallop
and
tearing
frantically
past
the
phantasm
went
down
the
road
to
my
left
i
then
saw
tammas
turning
a
somersault
miraculously
saved
from
falling
head
first
on
to
the
road
by
rebounding
from
the
pitchfork
which
had
been
wedged
upright
in
the
hay
whilst
the
figure
which
followed
in
their
wake
with
prodigious
bounds
was
apparently
trying
to
get
at
him
with
its
spidery
arms
but
whether
it
succeeded
or
not
i
can
not
say
for
i
was
so
uncontrollably
fearful
lest
it
should
return
to
me
that
i
mounted
my
bicycle
and
rode
as
i
had
never
ridden
before
and
have
never
ridden
since
i
described
the
incident
to
miss
macdonald
on
my
return
she
looked
very
serious
it
was
stupid
of
me
not
to
have
warned
you
she
said
that
that
particular
spot
in
the
road
has
always
at
least
ever
since
i
can
remember
borne
the
reputation
of
being
haunted
none
of
the
peasants
round
here
will
venture
within
a
mile
of
it
after
twilight
so
the
carters
you
saw
must
have
been
strangers
no
one
has
ever
seen
the
ghost
except
in
the
misty
form
in
which
it
appeared
to
you
it
does
not
frequent
the
place
every
night
it
only
appears
periodically
and
its
method
never
varies
it
leaps
over
a
wall
or
hedge
remains
stationary
till
some
one
approaches
and
then
pursues
them
with
monstrous
springs
the
person
it
touches
invariably
dies
within
a
year
i
well
recollect
when
i
was
in
my
teens
on
just
such
a
night
as
this
driving
home
with
my
father
from
lady
colin
ferner
croquet
party
at
blair
atholl
when
we
got
to
the
spot
you
name
the
horse
shied
and
before
i
could
realise
what
had
happened
we
were
racing
home
at
a
terrific
pace
my
father
and
i
sat
in
front
and
the
groom
a
highland
boy
from
the
valley
of
behind
never
having
seen
my
father
frightened
his
agitation
now
alarmed
me
horribly
and
the
more
so
as
my
instinct
told
me
it
was
caused
by
something
other
than
the
mere
bolting
of
the
horse
i
was
soon
enlightened
a
gigantic
figure
with
leaps
and
bounds
suddenly
overtook
us
and
thrusting
out
its
long
thin
arms
touched
my
father
lightly
on
the
hand
and
then
with
a
harsh
cry
more
like
that
of
some
strange
animal
than
that
of
a
human
being
disappeared
neither
of
us
spoke
till
we
reached
home
i
did
not
live
here
then
but
in
a
house
on
the
other
side
of
pitlochry
when
my
father
who
was
still
as
white
as
a
sheet
took
me
aside
and
whispered
you
do
flora
do
breathe
a
word
of
what
has
happened
to
your
mother
and
never
let
her
go
along
that
road
at
night
it
was
the
death
bogle
i
shall
die
within
twelve
months
and
he
did
miss
macdonald
paused
a
brief
silence
ensued
and
she
then
went
on
with
all
her
customary
briskness
i
can
not
describe
the
thing
any
more
than
you
can
except
that
it
gave
me
the
impression
it
had
no
eyes
but
what
it
was
whether
the
ghost
of
a
man
woman
or
some
peculiar
beast
i
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
tell
now
have
you
had
enough
horrors
for
one
evening
or
would
you
like
to
hear
just
one
more
knowing
that
sleep
was
utterly
out
of
the
question
and
that
one
or
two
more
thrills
would
make
very
little
difference
to
my
already
shattered
nerves
i
replied
that
i
would
listen
eagerly
to
anything
she
could
tell
me
however
horrible
my
permission
thus
gained
and
gained
so
readily
miss
macdonald
not
without
i
noticed
one
or
two
apprehensive
glances
at
the
slightly
rustling
curtains
began
her
narrative
which
ran
as
nearly
as
i
can
remember
as
follows
after
my
father
death
i
told
my
mother
about
our
adventure
the
night
we
drove
home
from
lady
colin
ferner
party
and
asked
her
if
she
remembered
ever
having
heard
anything
that
could
possibly
account
for
the
phenomenon
after
a
few
moments
reflection
this
is
the
story
she
told
me
the
inextinguishable
candle
of
the
old
white
house
there
was
once
a
house
known
as
the
old
white
house
that
used
to
stand
by
the
side
of
the
road
close
to
where
you
say
the
horse
first
took
fright
some
people
of
the
name
of
holkitt
relations
of
dear
old
sir
arthur
holkitt
and
great
friends
of
ours
used
to
live
there
the
house
it
was
popularly
believed
had
been
built
on
the
site
of
an
ancient
every
one
used
to
say
it
was
haunted
and
the
holkitts
had
great
trouble
in
getting
servants
the
appearance
of
the
haunted
house
did
not
belie
its
reputation
for
its
grey
walls
sombre
garden
gloomy
hall
dark
passages
and
staircase
and
attics
could
not
have
been
more
thoroughly
suggestive
of
all
kinds
of
ghostly
phenomena
moreover
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
place
no
matter
how
hot
and
bright
the
sun
was
cold
and
dreary
and
it
was
a
constant
source
of
wonder
to
every
one
how
lady
holkitt
could
live
there
she
was
however
always
cheerful
and
used
to
tell
me
that
nothing
would
induce
her
to
leave
a
spot
dear
to
so
many
generations
of
her
family
and
associated
with
the
happiest
recollections
in
her
life
she
was
very
fond
of
company
and
there
was
scarcely
a
week
in
the
year
in
which
she
had
not
some
one
staying
with
her
i
can
only
remember
her
as
widow
her
husband
a
major
in
the
gordon
highlanders
having
died
in
india
before
i
was
born
she
had
two
daughters
margaret
and
alice
both
considered
very
handsome
but
some
years
older
than
i
this
difference
in
age
however
did
not
prevent
our
being
on
very
friendly
terms
and
i
was
constantly
invited
to
their
house
in
the
summer
to
croquet
and
archery
in
the
winter
to
balls
like
most
elderly
ladies
of
that
period
lady
holkitt
was
very
fond
of
cards
and
she
and
my
mother
used
frequently
to
play
bezique
and
cribbage
whilst
the
girls
and
i
indulged
in
something
rather
more
frivolous
on
those
occasions
the
carriage
always
came
for
us
at
ten
since
my
mother
for
some
reason
or
other
i
had
a
shrewd
suspicion
it
was
on
account
of
the
alleged
haunting
would
never
return
home
after
that
time
when
she
accepted
an
invitation
to
a
ball
it
was
always
conditionally
that
lady
holkitt
would
put
us
both
up
for
the
night
and
the
carriage
used
then
to
come
for
us
the
following
day
after
one
luncheon
i
shall
never
forget
the
last
time
i
went
to
a
dance
at
the
old
white
house
though
it
is
now
rather
more
than
fifty
years
ago
my
mother
had
not
been
very
well
for
some
weeks
having
so
she
thought
taken
cold
internally
she
had
not
had
a
doctor
partly
because
she
did
not
feel
ill
enough
and
partly
because
the
only
medical
man
near
us
was
an
apothecary
of
whose
skill
she
had
a
very
poor
opinion
my
mother
had
quite
made
up
her
mind
to
accompany
me
to
the
ball
but
at
the
last
moment
the
weather
being
appalling
she
yielded
to
advice
and
my
aunt
norah
who
happened
to
be
staying
with
us
at
the
time
chaperoned
me
instead
it
was
snowing
when
we
set
out
and
as
it
snowed
all
through
the
night
and
most
of
the
next
day
the
roads
were
completely
blocked
and
we
had
to
remain
at
the
old
white
house
from
monday
evening
till
the
following
thursday
aunt
norah
and
i
occupied
separate
bedrooms
and
mine
was
at
the
end
of
a
long
passage
away
from
everybody
else
prior
to
this
my
mother
and
i
had
always
shared
a
room
the
only
really
pleasant
one
so
i
thought
in
the
house
overlooking
the
front
lawn
but
on
this
occasion
there
being
a
number
of
visitors
belated
like
ourselves
we
had
to
squeeze
in
wherever
we
could
and
as
my
aunt
and
i
were
to
have
separate
rooms
my
aunt
liking
a
room
to
herself
it
was
natural
that
she
should
be
allotted
the
largest
and
most
comfortable
consequently
she
was
domiciled
in
the
wing
where
all
the
other
visitors
slept
whilst
i
was
forced
to
retreat
to
a
passage
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
where
with
the
exception
of
my
apartment
there
were
none
other
but
all
went
smoothly
and
happily
and
nothing
interrupted
the
harmony
of
our
visit
till
the
night
before
we
returned
home
we
had
had
supper
our
meals
were
differently
arranged
in
those
days
and
margaret
and
i
were
ascending
the
staircase
on
our
way
to
bed
when
alice
who
had
run
upstairs
ahead
of
us
met
us
with
a
scared
face
oh
do
come
to
my
room
she
cried
something
has
happened
to
mary
mary
was
one
of
the
housemaids
we
both
accompanied
her
and
on
entering
her
room
found
mary
seated
on
a
chair
sobbing
hysterically
one
only
had
to
glance
at
the
girl
to
see
that
she
was
suffering
from
some
very
severe
shock
though
normally
and
placid
in
short
a
very
healthy
stolid
creature
and
the
last
person
to
be
easily
perturbed
she
was
now
without
a
vestige
of
colour
whilst
the
pupils
of
her
eyes
were
dilated
with
terror
and
her
entire
body
from
the
crown
of
her
head
to
the
soles
of
her
feet
shook
as
if
with
ague
i
was
immeasurably
shocked
to
see
her
why
mary
margaret
exclaimed
whatever
is
the
matter
what
has
happened
it
the
candle
miss
the
girl
gasped
the
candle
in
miss
room
i
ca
put
it
out
you
ca
put
it
out
why
what
nonsense
margaret
said
are
you
mad
it
is
as
true
as
i
sit
here
miss
mary
panted
i
put
the
candle
on
the
mantelpiece
while
i
set
the
room
to
rights
and
when
i
had
finished
and
came
to
blow
it
out
i
could
i
blew
and
blew
and
blew
but
it
had
any
effect
and
then
i
grew
afraid
miss
horribly
afraid
and
here
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
shuddered
i
never
been
frightened
like
this
before
miss
she
returned
slowly
and
i
come
away
and
left
the
candle
burning
how
absurd
of
you
margaret
scolded
we
must
go
and
put
it
out
at
once
i
have
a
good
mind
to
make
you
come
with
us
mary
but
there
stay
where
you
are
and
for
goodness
sake
stop
crying
or
every
one
in
the
house
will
hear
you
so
saying
margaret
hurried
off
alice
and
i
accompanying
her
and
on
arriving
outside
my
room
the
door
of
which
was
wide
open
we
perceived
the
lighted
candle
standing
in
the
position
mary
had
described
i
looked
at
the
girls
and
perceived
in
spite
of
my
endeavours
not
to
perceive
it
the
unmistakable
signs
of
a
great
fear
fear
of
something
they
suspected
but
dared
not
name
lurking
in
the
corners
of
their
eyes
who
will
go
first
margaret
demanded
no
one
spoke
well
then
she
continued
i
will
and
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
she
stepped
over
the
threshold
the
moment
she
did
so
the
door
began
to
close
this
is
curious
she
cried
push
we
did
we
all
three
pushed
but
despite
our
efforts
the
door
came
resolutely
to
and
we
were
shut
out
then
before
we
had
time
to
recover
from
our
astonishment
it
flew
open
but
before
we
could
cross
the
threshold
it
came
violently
to
in
the
same
manner
as
before
some
unseen
force
held
it
against
us
let
us
make
one
more
effort
margaret
said
and
if
we
succeed
we
will
call
for
help
obeying
her
instructions
we
once
again
pushed
i
was
nearest
the
handle
and
in
some
manner
how
none
of
us
could
ever
explain
just
as
the
door
opened
of
its
own
accord
i
slipped
and
fell
inside
the
door
then
closed
immediately
with
a
bang
and
to
my
unmitigated
horror
i
found
myself
alone
in
the
room
for
some
seconds
i
was
spellbound
and
could
not
even
collect
my
thoughts
sufficiently
to
frame
a
reply
to
the
piteous
entreaties
of
the
holkitts
who
kept
banging
on
the
door
and
imploring
me
to
tell
them
what
was
happening
never
in
the
hideous
excitement
of
nightmare
had
i
experienced
such
a
terror
as
the
terror
that
room
conveyed
to
my
mind
though
nothing
was
to
be
seen
nothing
but
the
candle
the
light
of
which
was
peculiarly
white
and
vibrating
i
felt
the
presence
of
something
inexpressibly
menacing
and
horrible
it
was
in
the
light
the
atmosphere
the
furniture
everywhere
on
all
sides
it
surrounded
me
on
all
sides
i
was
threatened
threatened
in
a
manner
that
was
strange
and
deadly
something
suggesting
to
me
that
the
source
of
evil
originated
in
the
candle
and
that
if
i
could
succeed
in
extinguishing
the
light
i
should
free
myself
from
the
ghostly
presence
i
advanced
towards
the
mantelpiece
and
drawing
in
a
deep
breath
blew
blew
with
the
energy
born
of
desperation
it
had
no
effect
i
repeated
my
efforts
i
blew
frantically
madly
but
all
to
no
purpose
the
candle
still
burned
burned
softly
and
mockingly
then
a
fearful
terror
seized
me
and
flying
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
i
buried
my
face
against
the
wall
and
waited
for
what
the
sickly
beatings
of
my
heart
warned
me
was
coming
constrained
to
look
i
slightly
only
very
very
slightly
moved
round
and
there
there
floating
stealthily
towards
me
through
the
air
came
the
candle
the
vibrating
glowing
baleful
candle
i
hid
my
face
again
and
prayed
god
to
let
me
faint
nearer
and
nearer
drew
the
light
wilder
and
wilder
the
wrenches
at
the
door
closer
and
closer
i
pressed
myself
to
the
wall
and
then
then
when
the
final
throes
of
agony
were
more
than
human
heart
and
brain
could
stand
there
came
the
suspicion
the
suggestion
of
a
touch
of
a
touch
so
horrid
that
my
prayers
were
at
last
answered
and
i
fainted
when
i
recovered
i
was
in
margaret
room
and
half
a
dozen
forms
were
gathered
round
me
it
appears
that
with
the
collapse
of
my
body
on
the
floor
the
door
that
had
so
effectually
resisted
every
effort
to
turn
the
handle
immediately
flew
open
and
i
was
discovered
lying
on
the
ground
with
the
candle
still
alight
on
the
ground
beside
me
my
aunt
experienced
no
difficulty
in
blowing
out
the
refractory
candle
and
i
was
carried
with
the
greatest
tenderness
into
the
other
wing
of
the
house
where
i
slept
that
night
little
was
said
about
the
incident
next
day
but
all
who
knew
of
it
expressed
in
their
faces
the
utmost
anxiety
an
anxiety
which
now
that
i
had
recovered
greatly
puzzled
me
on
our
return
home
another
shock
awaited
me
we
found
to
our
dismay
that
my
mother
was
seriously
ill
and
that
the
doctor
who
had
been
sent
for
from
perth
the
previous
evening
just
about
the
time
of
my
adventure
with
the
candle
had
stated
that
she
might
not
survive
the
day
his
warning
was
fulfilled
she
died
at
sunset
her
death
of
course
may
have
had
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
candle
episode
yet
it
struck
me
then
as
an
odd
coincidence
and
seems
all
the
more
strange
to
me
after
hearing
your
account
of
the
bogle
that
touched
your
dear
father
in
the
road
so
near
the
spot
where
the
house
once
stood
i
could
never
discover
whether
lady
holkitt
or
her
daughters
ever
saw
anything
of
a
superphysical
nature
in
their
house
after
my
experience
they
were
always
very
reticent
on
that
subject
and
naturally
i
did
not
like
to
press
it
on
lady
holkitt
death
margaret
and
alice
sold
the
house
which
was
eventually
pulled
down
as
no
one
would
live
in
it
and
i
believe
the
ground
on
which
it
stood
is
now
a
turnip
field
that
my
dear
is
all
i
can
tell
you
now
miss
macdonald
added
having
heard
our
experiences
my
mother
and
mine
what
is
your
opinion
do
you
think
the
phenomenon
of
the
candle
was
in
any
way
connected
with
the
bogle
both
you
and
i
have
seen
or
are
the
hauntings
of
old
white
house
entirely
separate
from
those
of
the
road
case
ii
the
top
attic
in
pringle
mansion
edinburgh
a
charming
lady
miss
south
informs
me
that
no
house
interested
her
more
as
a
child
than
pringle
mansion
edinburgh
mansion
by
the
bye
is
not
the
real
name
of
the
house
nor
is
the
original
building
still
standing
the
fact
is
my
friend
has
been
obliged
to
disguise
the
locality
for
fear
of
an
action
for
slander
of
title
such
as
happened
in
the
egham
case
of
miss
south
never
saw
save
in
a
picture
the
house
that
so
fascinated
her
but
through
repeatedly
hearing
about
it
from
her
old
nurse
she
felt
that
she
knew
it
by
heart
and
used
to
amuse
herself
hour
after
hour
in
the
nursery
drawing
diagrams
of
the
rooms
and
passages
which
to
make
quite
realistic
she
named
and
numbered
there
was
the
admiral
room
madame
room
miss
ophelia
room
master
gregory
room
letty
the
nurse
room
the
cook
room
the
butler
room
the
housemaid
room
and
the
haunted
room
the
house
was
very
old
probably
the
sixteenth
century
and
was
concealed
from
the
thoroughfare
by
a
high
wall
that
enclosed
it
on
all
sides
it
had
no
garden
only
a
large
yard
covered
with
faded
yellow
and
containing
a
well
with
an
roller
and
bucket
when
the
well
was
cleaned
out
an
event
which
took
place
periodically
on
a
certain
date
every
utensil
in
the
house
was
called
into
requisition
for
ladling
out
the
water
and
the
admiral
himself
supervising
made
every
servant
in
the
establishment
take
an
active
part
in
the
proceedings
on
one
of
these
occasions
the
admiral
announced
his
intention
of
going
down
the
well
in
the
bucket
that
was
a
rare
moment
in
letty
life
for
when
the
admiral
had
been
let
down
in
the
bucket
the
rope
broke
indeed
the
thought
of
what
the
laird
would
say
when
he
came
up
almost
resulted
in
his
not
coming
up
at
all
however
some
one
rather
bolder
than
the
rest
retained
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
effect
a
rescue
and
the
timid
ones
thankful
enough
to
survive
the
explosion
had
to
be
content
on
till
further
orders
but
in
spite
of
its
association
with
such
a
martinet
and
in
spite
of
her
ghostly
experiences
in
it
letty
loved
the
house
and
was
never
tired
of
singing
its
praises
it
was
a
mansion
with
roomy
cellars
but
no
basement
there
were
four
all
on
the
ground
floor
numerous
kitchen
offices
including
a
cosy
housekeeper
room
and
a
capacious
entrance
hall
in
the
centre
of
which
stood
a
broad
oak
staircase
the
cellars
three
in
number
and
chiefly
used
as
were
deep
down
and
dank
and
horrid
on
the
first
floor
eight
bedrooms
opened
on
to
a
gallery
overlooking
the
hall
and
the
top
storey
where
the
servants
slept
consisted
solely
of
attics
connected
with
one
another
by
dark
narrow
passages
it
was
one
of
these
attics
that
was
haunted
although
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
ghost
had
been
seen
in
all
parts
of
the
house
when
letty
entered
the
admiral
service
she
was
but
a
bairn
and
had
never
even
heard
of
ghosts
nor
did
the
other
servants
apprise
her
of
the
hauntings
having
received
strict
injunctions
not
to
do
so
from
the
laird
but
letty
home
humble
though
it
was
had
been
very
bright
and
cheerful
and
the
dark
precincts
of
the
mansion
filled
her
with
dismay
without
exactly
knowing
why
she
was
afraid
she
shrank
in
terror
from
descending
into
the
cellars
and
felt
anything
but
pleased
at
the
prospect
of
sleeping
alone
in
an
attic
still
nothing
occurred
to
really
alarm
her
till
about
a
month
after
her
arrival
it
was
early
in
the
evening
soon
after
twilight
and
she
had
gone
down
into
one
of
the
cellars
to
look
for
a
which
the
admiral
swore
by
all
that
was
holy
must
be
found
before
supper
placing
the
light
she
had
brought
with
her
on
a
she
was
groping
about
among
the
boxes
when
she
perceived
to
her
astonishment
that
the
flame
of
the
candle
had
suddenly
turned
blue
she
then
felt
icy
cold
and
was
much
startled
on
hearing
a
loud
clatter
as
of
some
metal
instrument
on
the
stone
floor
in
the
corner
of
the
cellar
glancing
in
the
direction
of
the
noise
she
saw
looking
at
her
two
eyes
two
obliquely
set
lurid
light
eyes
full
of
the
utmost
devilry
sick
with
terror
and
utterly
unable
to
account
for
what
she
beheld
she
stood
her
limbs
refusing
to
move
her
throat
parched
her
tongue
tied
the
clanging
was
repeated
and
a
shadowy
form
began
slowly
to
crawl
towards
her
she
dared
not
afterwards
surmise
what
would
have
happened
to
her
had
not
the
laird
himself
come
down
at
this
moment
at
the
sound
of
his
stentorian
voice
the
phantasm
vanished
but
the
shock
had
been
too
much
for
letty
she
fainted
and
the
admiral
carrying
her
upstairs
as
carefully
as
if
she
had
been
his
own
daughter
gave
peremptory
orders
that
she
should
never
again
be
allowed
to
go
into
the
cellar
alone
but
now
that
letty
herself
had
witnessed
a
manifestation
the
other
servants
no
longer
felt
bound
to
secrecy
and
soon
poured
into
her
ears
endless
accounts
of
the
hauntings
every
one
they
informed
her
except
master
gregory
and
perkins
the
butler
had
seen
one
or
other
of
the
ghosts
and
the
cellar
apparition
was
quite
familiar
to
them
all
they
also
declared
that
there
were
other
parts
of
the
house
quite
as
badly
haunted
as
the
cellar
and
it
might
have
been
partly
owing
to
these
gruesome
stories
that
poor
letty
always
felt
scared
when
crossing
the
passages
leading
to
the
attics
as
she
was
hastening
down
one
of
them
early
one
morning
she
heard
some
one
running
after
her
thinking
it
was
one
of
the
other
servants
she
turned
round
pleased
to
think
that
some
one
else
was
up
early
too
and
saw
to
her
horror
a
object
that
seemed
to
be
partly
human
and
partly
animal
the
body
was
quite
small
and
its
face
bloated
and
covered
with
yellow
spots
it
had
an
enormous
animal
mouth
the
lips
of
which
moving
furiously
without
emitting
any
sound
showed
that
the
creature
was
endeavouring
to
speak
but
could
not
the
moment
letty
screamed
for
help
the
phantasm
vanished
but
her
worst
experience
was
yet
to
come
the
spare
attic
which
she
was
told
was
so
badly
haunted
that
no
one
would
sleep
in
it
was
the
room
next
to
hers
it
was
a
room
letty
could
well
believe
was
haunted
for
she
had
never
seen
another
equally
gloomy
the
ceiling
was
low
and
sloping
the
window
tiny
and
the
walls
exhibited
all
sorts
of
odd
nooks
and
crannies
a
bed
antique
and
stood
in
one
recess
a
black
oak
chest
in
another
and
at
right
angles
with
the
door
in
another
recess
stood
a
wardrobe
that
used
to
creak
and
groan
alarmingly
every
time
letty
walked
a
long
the
passage
once
she
heard
a
chuckle
a
low
diabolical
chuckle
which
she
fancied
came
from
the
chest
and
once
when
the
door
of
the
room
was
open
she
caught
the
glitter
of
a
pair
of
eyes
the
same
pale
malevolent
eyes
that
had
so
frightened
her
in
the
cellar
from
her
earliest
childhood
letty
had
been
periodically
given
to
somnambulism
and
one
night
just
about
a
year
after
she
went
into
service
she
got
out
of
bed
and
walked
in
her
sleep
into
the
haunted
room
she
awoke
to
find
herself
standing
cold
and
shivering
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
it
was
some
seconds
before
she
realised
where
she
was
her
horror
when
she
did
discover
where
she
was
is
not
easily
described
the
room
was
bathed
in
moonlight
and
the
beams
falling
with
noticeable
brilliancy
on
each
piece
of
furniture
the
room
contained
at
once
riveted
letty
attention
and
so
fascinated
her
that
she
found
herself
utterly
unable
to
move
a
terrible
and
most
unusual
silence
predominated
everywhere
and
although
letty
senses
were
wonderfully
and
painfully
on
the
alert
she
could
not
catch
the
slightest
sound
from
any
of
the
rooms
on
the
landing
the
night
was
absolutely
still
no
breath
of
wind
no
rustle
of
leaves
no
flapping
of
ivy
against
the
window
yet
the
door
suddenly
swung
back
on
its
hinges
and
slammed
furiously
letty
felt
that
this
was
the
work
of
some
supernatural
agency
and
fully
expecting
that
the
noise
had
awakened
the
cook
who
was
a
light
sleeper
or
pretended
she
was
listened
in
a
fever
of
excitement
to
hear
her
get
out
of
bed
and
call
out
the
slightest
noise
and
the
spell
that
held
her
prisoner
would
letty
felt
sure
be
broken
but
the
same
unbroken
silence
prevailed
a
sudden
rustling
made
letty
glance
fearfully
at
the
bed
and
she
perceived
to
her
terror
the
valance
swaying
violently
to
and
fro
sick
with
fear
she
was
now
constrained
to
stare
in
abject
helplessness
presently
there
was
a
slight
very
slight
movement
on
the
mattress
the
white
dust
cover
rose
and
under
it
letty
saw
the
outlines
of
what
she
took
to
be
a
human
figure
gradually
take
shape
hoping
praying
that
she
was
mistaken
and
that
what
appeared
to
be
on
the
bed
was
but
a
trick
of
her
imagination
she
continued
staring
in
an
agony
of
anticipation
but
the
figure
remained
extended
at
full
length
like
a
corpse
the
minutes
slowly
passed
a
church
clock
boomed
two
and
the
body
moved
letty
jaw
fell
her
eyes
almost
bulged
from
her
head
whilst
her
fingers
closed
convulsively
on
the
folds
of
her
the
unmistakable
sound
of
breathing
now
issued
from
the
region
of
the
bed
and
the
commenced
slowly
to
slip
aside
inch
by
inch
it
moved
until
first
of
all
letty
saw
a
few
wisps
of
dark
hair
then
a
few
more
then
a
thick
cluster
then
something
white
and
shining
a
protruding
forehead
then
dark
very
dark
brows
then
two
eyelids
yellow
swollen
and
fortunately
tightly
closed
then
a
purple
conglomeration
of
letty
knew
not
what
of
anything
but
what
was
human
the
sight
was
so
monstrous
it
appalled
her
and
she
was
overcome
with
a
species
of
awe
and
repulsion
for
which
the
language
of
mortality
has
no
sufficiently
energetic
expression
she
momentarily
forgot
that
what
she
looked
on
was
merely
superphysical
but
regarded
it
as
something
alive
something
that
ought
to
have
been
a
child
comely
and
healthy
as
herself
and
she
hated
it
it
was
an
outrage
on
maternity
a
blot
on
nature
a
filthy
discredit
to
the
house
a
blight
a
sore
a
gangrene
it
turned
over
in
its
sleep
the
cover
was
hurled
aside
and
a
grotesque
object
round
pulpy
webbed
and
of
leprous
whiteness
an
object
which
letty
could
hardly
associate
with
a
hand
came
grovelling
out
letty
stomach
heaved
the
thing
was
beastly
indecent
vile
it
ought
not
to
live
and
the
idea
of
killing
flashed
through
her
mind
boiling
over
with
indignation
and
absurdly
forgetful
of
her
surroundings
she
turned
round
and
groped
for
a
stone
to
smash
it
the
moonlight
on
her
naked
toes
brought
her
to
her
senses
the
thing
in
the
bed
was
a
devil
though
brought
up
a
member
of
the
free
church
with
an
abhorrence
of
anything
that
could
in
any
way
be
contorted
into
papist
practices
letty
crossed
herself
as
she
did
so
a
noise
in
the
passage
outside
augmented
her
terror
she
strained
her
ears
painfully
and
the
sound
developed
into
a
footstep
soft
light
and
surreptitious
it
came
gently
towards
the
door
it
paused
outside
and
letty
intuitively
felt
that
it
was
listening
her
suspense
was
now
so
intolerable
that
it
was
almost
with
a
feeling
of
relief
that
she
beheld
the
door
slowly
very
slowly
begin
to
open
a
little
wider
a
little
wider
and
yet
a
little
wider
but
still
nothing
came
ah
letty
heart
turned
to
ice
another
inch
and
a
shadowy
something
slipped
through
and
began
to
wriggle
itself
stealthily
over
the
floor
letty
tried
to
divert
her
gaze
but
could
not
an
irresistible
magnetic
attraction
kept
her
eyes
glued
to
the
gradually
approaching
horror
when
within
a
few
feet
of
her
it
halted
and
again
letty
felt
it
was
listening
listening
to
the
breathing
on
the
bed
which
was
heavy
and
bestial
then
it
twisted
round
and
letty
watched
it
crawl
into
the
wardrobe
after
this
there
was
a
long
and
anxious
wait
then
letty
saw
the
wardrobe
door
slyly
open
and
the
eyes
of
the
cellar
inexpressibly
baleful
and
glittering
like
burnished
steel
in
the
strong
phosphorescent
glow
of
the
moon
peep
out
not
at
her
but
her
at
the
object
lying
on
the
bed
there
were
not
only
eyes
this
time
but
a
form
vague
misty
and
irregular
but
still
with
sufficient
shape
to
enable
letty
to
identify
it
as
that
of
a
woman
tall
and
thin
and
with
a
total
absence
of
hair
which
was
emphasised
in
the
most
lurid
and
ghastly
fashion
with
a
snakelike
movement
the
evil
thing
slithered
out
of
the
wardrobe
and
gliding
past
letty
approached
the
bed
letty
was
obliged
to
follow
every
proceeding
she
saw
the
thing
deftly
snatch
the
bolster
from
under
the
sleeping
head
noted
the
gleam
of
hellish
satisfaction
in
its
eyes
as
it
pressed
the
bolster
down
and
watched
the
murdered
creature
contortions
grow
fainter
and
fainter
until
they
finally
ceased
the
eyes
then
left
the
room
and
from
afar
off
away
below
in
the
abysmal
cellars
of
the
house
came
the
sound
of
digging
faint
very
faint
but
unquestionably
digging
this
terminated
the
grim
phantasmal
drama
for
that
night
at
least
and
letty
chilled
to
the
bone
but
thoroughly
alert
escaped
to
her
room
she
spent
her
few
remaining
hours
of
rest
determining
never
to
go
to
bed
again
without
fastening
one
of
her
arms
to
the
iron
staples
with
regard
the
history
of
the
house
letty
never
learned
anything
more
remarkable
than
that
long
ago
an
idiot
child
was
supposed
to
have
been
murdered
in
the
haunted
attic
by
whom
tradition
did
not
say
the
admiral
and
his
family
left
pringle
mansion
the
year
letty
became
miss
south
nurse
and
as
no
one
would
stay
in
the
house
presumably
on
account
of
the
hauntings
it
was
pulled
down
and
an
inexcusably
inartistic
edifice
was
erected
in
its
place
case
iii
the
bounding
figure
of
house
near
buckingham
terrace
edinburgh
no
one
is
more
interested
in
psychical
investigation
work
than
miss
torfrida
vincent
one
of
the
three
beautiful
daughters
of
de
vincent
who
is
herself
still
in
the
heyday
of
life
and
one
of
the
loveliest
of
the
society
women
i
have
met
though
i
have
known
her
sisters
several
years
i
only
met
torfrida
for
the
first
time
a
few
months
ago
when
she
was
superintending
the
nursing
of
her
mother
who
had
just
undergone
an
operation
for
appendicitis
one
day
when
i
was
visiting
my
convalescent
friend
torfrida
informed
me
that
she
knew
of
a
haunted
house
in
edinburgh
a
case
which
she
felt
sure
would
arouse
my
interest
and
enthusiasm
it
is
unfortunate
she
added
somewhat
regretfully
that
i
can
not
tell
you
the
number
of
the
house
but
as
i
have
given
my
word
of
honour
to
disclose
it
to
no
one
i
feel
sure
you
will
excuse
me
indeed
my
friends
the
gordons
who
extracted
the
promise
from
me
have
got
into
sad
trouble
with
their
landlord
for
leaving
the
house
under
the
pretext
that
it
was
haunted
and
he
has
threatened
to
prosecute
them
for
slander
of
title
the
house
in
question
has
no
claim
to
antiquity
it
may
be
eighty
years
old
perhaps
a
little
older
and
was
at
the
time
of
which
i
speak
let
out
in
flats
the
gordons
occupied
the
second
storey
the
one
above
them
was
untenanted
and
used
as
a
storage
place
for
furniture
the
first
floor
and
ground
floor
were
divided
into
chambers
and
offices
they
had
not
been
in
their
new
quarters
more
than
a
week
when
gordon
asked
the
night
porter
who
it
was
that
made
such
a
noise
racing
up
their
stairs
between
two
and
three
in
the
morning
it
had
awakened
her
every
night
she
told
him
and
she
would
be
glad
if
the
disturbance
were
discontinued
i
am
sorry
madam
but
i
can
not
imagine
who
it
can
be
the
man
replied
of
course
it
may
be
some
one
next
door
sounds
are
so
often
deceptive
no
one
inhabits
the
rooms
above
you
but
gordon
was
not
at
all
convinced
and
made
up
her
mind
to
complain
to
the
landlord
should
it
occur
again
that
night
nothing
happened
but
the
night
after
she
was
roused
from
her
sleep
at
two
by
a
feeling
that
something
dreadful
some
dire
catastrophe
was
about
to
take
place
the
house
was
very
still
and
beyond
the
echoes
of
a
policeman
patrol
on
the
hard
pavement
outside
nothing
absolutely
nothing
broke
the
universal
and
as
it
seemed
to
her
unnatural
silence
generally
at
there
are
sounds
one
likes
to
assure
oneself
are
too
trivial
to
be
heard
during
the
day
the
creaking
of
boards
stairs
nearly
always
stairs
and
the
tapping
of
some
leaf
of
course
some
leaf
at
the
windows
who
has
not
heard
such
sounds
and
who
in
his
heart
of
hearts
has
not
been
only
too
well
aware
that
they
are
nocturnal
exclusively
nocturnal
the
shadows
of
evening
bring
with
them
visitors
prying
curious
visitors
grim
and
ghastly
visitors
grey
esoteric
visitors
visitors
from
a
world
seemingly
inconsequent
wholly
incomprehensible
gordon
did
not
believe
in
ghosts
she
scoffed
at
the
idea
of
ghosts
and
like
so
many
wits
unreasonably
brave
by
day
and
the
reverse
by
night
had
hitherto
attributed
banshees
and
the
like
to
cats
and
other
animals
but
now
now
when
all
was
dark
pitch
dark
and
hushed
and
she
for
aught
she
knew
to
the
contrary
the
only
one
in
that
great
rambling
building
awake
she
reviewed
again
and
again
in
her
mind
that
rushing
up
the
stairs
the
wind
it
could
not
have
been
the
wind
the
wind
shuts
doors
and
rattles
windows
and
moans
and
sighs
and
howls
and
screeches
but
it
does
not
walk
the
house
in
boots
neither
do
rats
and
if
she
had
imagined
the
noises
why
did
she
not
imagine
other
things
why
for
example
did
she
not
see
tables
dance
and
walk
all
that
would
be
fancy
unblushing
genuine
fancy
and
if
she
conjured
up
one
absurdity
why
not
another
that
was
a
conundrum
for
any
sceptic
thus
did
she
argue
naturally
and
logically
in
the
quite
sensible
fashion
of
a
lawyer
or
a
scientist
yet
all
the
while
her
senses
told
her
that
the
atmosphere
of
the
house
had
undergone
some
profoundly
subtle
and
unaccountable
change
a
change
that
brought
with
it
a
presence
at
once
sinister
and
hostile
she
longed
to
strike
a
light
and
awake
one
of
her
daughters
diana
by
preference
since
diana
was
the
least
likely
to
mind
being
disturbed
and
had
the
strongest
nerves
she
made
a
start
and
loosening
the
bedclothes
that
she
always
liked
tightly
tucked
round
her
thrust
out
a
quivering
toe
the
next
instant
she
drew
it
back
with
a
tiny
gasp
of
terror
the
cold
darkness
without
had
suggested
to
her
mind
a
great
horny
hand
and
murderous
that
was
lying
in
wait
to
seize
her
a
deadly
sickness
overcame
her
and
she
lay
back
on
the
pillow
her
heart
beating
with
outrageous
irregularity
and
loudness
very
slowly
she
recovered
and
holding
her
breath
sidled
to
the
far
edge
of
the
bed
and
with
a
dexterous
movement
engendered
by
the
desperation
of
fear
made
a
dab
in
the
direction
of
the
electric
bell
her
soft
pink
finger
missed
the
mark
and
coming
in
violent
contact
with
the
wall
bent
the
carefully
polished
nail
she
bit
her
lips
to
stop
a
cry
of
pain
and
shrinking
back
within
the
folds
of
her
dainty
lace
embroidered
nightdress
abandoned
herself
to
despair
her
consciousness
of
the
unknown
presence
increased
and
she
instinctively
felt
the
thing
pass
through
the
closed
door
down
on
to
the
landing
outside
when
it
dashed
upstairs
with
a
loud
clatter
and
entering
the
immediately
overhead
began
bounding
as
if
its
feet
were
tied
together
backwards
and
forwards
across
the
floor
after
continuing
for
fully
half
an
hour
the
noises
abruptly
ceased
and
the
house
resumed
its
accustomed
quiet
at
breakfast
gordon
asked
her
daughters
if
they
had
heard
anything
in
the
night
and
they
laughingly
said
no
not
even
a
mouse
there
was
now
an
intermission
of
the
disturbances
and
no
further
demonstration
occurred
for
about
a
month
diana
was
then
sleeping
in
her
mother
room
gordon
being
away
on
a
visit
to
lady
voss
who
was
entertaining
a
party
of
friends
at
her
in
argyle
one
evening
as
diana
was
going
into
her
bedroom
to
prepare
for
dinner
she
saw
the
door
suddenly
swing
open
and
something
she
could
not
tell
what
it
was
so
blurred
and
indistinct
come
out
with
a
bound
tearing
past
her
on
to
the
landing
it
rushed
up
the
stairs
with
so
much
clatter
that
diana
imagined
though
she
could
see
nothing
that
it
must
have
on
its
feet
heavy
lumbering
boots
filled
with
an
irresistible
curiosity
in
spite
of
her
alarm
diana
ran
after
it
and
on
reaching
the
upper
storey
heard
it
making
a
terrific
racket
in
the
room
above
the
one
in
which
she
now
slept
nothing
daunted
however
she
boldly
approached
and
flinging
open
the
door
perceived
its
filmy
outline
standing
before
a
shadowy
and
very
antique
clock
which
apparently
it
was
in
the
habit
of
winding
a
great
fear
now
fell
on
diana
what
was
the
thing
and
supposing
it
should
turn
round
and
face
her
what
should
she
see
she
was
entirely
isolated
from
her
sisters
and
the
servants
alone
the
light
fading
in
a
big
gloomy
room
full
of
strange
old
furniture
which
suggested
for
all
sorts
of
grim
possibilities
she
was
assured
now
that
the
thing
she
had
followed
was
nothing
human
neither
was
it
a
delusion
for
when
she
shut
her
eyes
and
opened
them
it
was
still
there
and
oddly
enough
it
was
now
more
distinct
than
it
was
when
she
had
seen
it
downstairs
a
curious
feeling
of
helplessness
stole
over
diana
the
power
of
speech
forsook
her
and
her
limbs
grew
rigid
she
was
so
fearful
too
of
attracting
the
notice
of
the
mysterious
thing
that
she
hardly
dare
breathe
and
each
pulsation
of
her
heart
sent
cold
chills
of
apprehension
down
her
spine
once
she
endured
agonies
through
a
mad
desire
to
sneeze
and
once
her
lips
opened
to
scream
as
something
suspiciously
like
the
antennæ
of
a
huge
beetle
and
which
she
subsequently
discovered
was
a
devil
tickled
the
calf
of
her
leg
she
fancied
too
that
all
sorts
of
queer
shapes
lurked
in
the
passage
behind
her
and
that
innumerable
unseen
eyes
were
malignantly
rejoicing
in
her
terror
at
last
the
climax
to
her
suspense
seemed
at
hand
the
unknown
thing
until
now
too
busy
with
the
clock
to
take
heed
of
her
paused
for
a
moment
or
so
as
if
undecided
what
to
do
next
and
then
slowly
began
to
veer
round
but
the
faint
echo
of
a
voice
below
calling
her
by
name
broke
the
hypnotic
spell
that
bound
diana
to
the
floor
and
with
a
frantic
spring
she
cleared
the
threshold
of
the
room
she
then
tore
madly
downstairs
never
halting
till
she
reached
the
where
she
sank
on
a
sofa
and
more
dead
than
alive
panted
out
to
her
amazed
sisters
a
full
account
of
all
that
had
transpired
that
night
she
shared
her
sister
bedroom
but
neither
she
nor
her
sister
slept
from
this
time
till
the
return
of
gordon
nothing
happened
it
was
one
evening
after
she
came
back
when
she
was
preparing
to
get
into
bed
that
the
door
of
her
own
room
unexpectedly
opened
and
she
saw
standing
on
the
threshold
the
unmistakable
figure
of
a
man
short
and
broad
with
a
great
width
of
shoulders
and
very
long
arms
he
was
clad
in
a
peajacket
blue
serge
trousers
and
he
had
a
big
round
brutal
head
covered
with
a
tangled
mass
of
yellow
hair
but
where
his
face
ought
to
have
been
there
was
only
a
blotch
underlying
which
gordon
detected
the
semblance
to
something
fiendishly
vindictive
and
immeasurably
nasty
but
in
spite
of
the
horror
his
appearance
produced
her
curiosity
was
aroused
with
regard
to
the
two
objects
he
carried
in
his
hands
one
of
which
looked
like
a
very
bizarre
bundle
of
red
and
white
rags
and
the
other
a
small
bladder
of
lard
whilst
she
was
staring
at
them
in
dumb
awe
he
swung
round
and
hitching
them
savagely
under
his
armpits
rushed
across
the
landing
and
with
a
series
of
apish
bounds
sprang
up
the
staircase
and
disappeared
in
the
gloom
this
was
the
climax
gordon
felt
another
such
encounter
would
kill
her
so
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
had
taken
the
flat
for
a
year
and
had
only
just
commenced
her
tenancy
she
packed
up
her
goods
and
left
the
very
next
day
the
report
that
the
building
was
haunted
spread
rapidly
and
gordon
had
many
indignant
letters
from
the
landlord
she
naturally
made
inquiries
as
to
the
early
history
of
the
house
but
of
the
many
tales
she
listened
to
only
one
the
authenticity
of
which
she
could
not
guarantee
seemed
to
suggest
any
clue
to
the
haunting
it
was
said
that
a
retired
captain
in
the
merchant
service
many
years
previously
had
rented
the
rooms
she
had
occupied
he
was
an
extraordinary
individual
and
despite
the
fact
that
he
had
lived
so
far
inland
would
never
wear
any
but
nautical
clothes
blue
jersey
and
trousers
reefer
coat
and
but
this
was
not
his
only
peculiarity
his
love
of
grog
eventually
brought
on
delirium
tremens
and
his
excessive
irritability
in
the
interval
between
each
attack
was
a
source
of
anxiety
to
all
who
came
in
contact
with
him
at
that
time
there
happened
to
be
a
baby
in
the
rooms
overhead
whose
crying
so
annoyed
the
captain
that
he
savagely
informed
its
mother
that
if
she
did
not
keep
it
quiet
he
would
not
be
answerable
for
the
consequences
his
warnings
having
no
effect
he
flew
upstairs
one
day
when
she
was
temporarily
absent
and
snatching
up
the
bread
knife
from
the
table
decapitated
the
infant
he
then
stuffed
both
its
head
and
body
into
a
grandfather
clock
which
stood
in
one
corner
of
the
room
and
retiring
to
his
own
quarters
drank
till
he
was
insensible
he
was
of
course
arrested
on
a
charge
of
murder
but
being
found
insane
he
was
committed
during
his
majesty
pleasure
to
a
lunatic
asylum
he
eventually
committed
suicide
by
opening
an
artery
in
his
leg
with
one
of
his
as
the
details
of
this
tragedy
filled
in
so
well
with
the
phenomena
they
had
witnessed
the
gordons
could
not
help
regarding
the
story
as
a
very
probable
explanation
of
the
hauntings
but
remember
its
authenticity
is
dubious
case
iv
jane
of
george
street
edinburgh
the
news
that
for
several
years
at
any
rate
george
street
edinburgh
was
haunted
wrote
a
correspondent
of
mine
some
short
time
ago
might
cause
no
little
surprise
to
many
of
its
inhabitants
and
my
friend
proceeded
to
relate
his
experience
of
the
haunting
which
i
will
reproduce
as
nearly
as
possible
in
his
own
words
i
quote
from
memory
having
foolishly
destroyed
the
letter
i
was
walking
in
a
leisurely
way
along
george
street
the
other
day
towards
strunalls
where
i
get
my
cigars
and
had
arrived
opposite
no
when
i
suddenly
noticed
just
ahead
of
me
a
tall
lady
of
remarkably
graceful
figure
clad
in
a
costume
which
even
to
an
ignoramus
in
fashions
like
myself
seemed
extraordinarily
out
of
date
in
my
untechnical
language
it
consisted
of
a
dark
blue
coat
and
skirt
trimmed
with
black
braid
the
coat
had
a
very
high
collar
turned
over
to
show
a
facing
of
blue
velvet
its
sleeves
were
very
full
at
the
shoulders
and
a
band
of
blue
velvet
drew
it
tightly
in
at
the
waist
moreover
unlike
every
other
lady
i
saw
she
wore
a
small
hat
which
i
subsequently
learned
was
a
toque
with
one
white
and
one
blue
plume
placed
moderately
high
at
the
side
the
only
other
conspicuous
items
of
her
dress
the
effect
of
which
was
on
the
whole
quiet
were
white
glacé
gloves
over
which
dangled
gold
curb
bracelets
with
innumerable
pendants
shoes
which
were
of
patent
leather
with
silver
buckles
and
rather
high
louis
heels
and
fine
blue
silk
openwork
stockings
so
much
for
her
dress
now
for
her
herself
she
was
a
strikingly
fair
woman
with
very
pale
yellow
hair
and
a
startlingly
white
complexion
and
this
latter
peculiarity
so
impressed
me
that
i
hastened
my
steps
determining
to
get
a
full
view
of
her
passing
her
with
rapid
strides
i
looked
back
and
as
i
did
so
a
cold
chill
ran
through
me
what
i
looked
at
was
the
face
of
the
dead
i
slowed
down
and
allowed
her
to
take
the
lead
i
now
observed
that
startling
as
she
was
no
one
else
seemed
to
notice
her
one
or
two
people
obviously
though
probably
unconsciously
possessing
the
germs
of
psychism
shivered
when
they
passed
her
but
as
they
neither
slackened
their
pace
nor
turned
to
steal
a
second
look
i
concluded
they
had
not
seen
her
without
glancing
either
to
the
right
or
left
she
moved
steadily
on
past
molton
the
confectioner
past
perrin
the
hatter
once
i
thought
she
was
coming
to
a
halt
and
that
she
intended
crossing
the
road
but
no
on
on
on
till
we
came
to
d
street
there
we
were
preparing
to
cross
over
when
an
elderly
gentleman
walked
deliberately
into
her
i
half
expected
to
hear
him
apologise
but
naturally
nothing
of
the
sort
happened
she
was
only
too
obviously
a
phantom
and
in
accordance
with
the
nature
of
a
phantom
she
passed
right
through
him
a
few
yards
farther
on
she
came
to
an
abrupt
pause
and
then
with
a
slight
inclination
of
her
head
as
if
meaning
me
to
follow
she
glided
into
a
chemist
shop
she
was
certainly
not
more
than
six
feet
ahead
of
me
when
she
passed
through
the
door
and
i
was
even
nearer
than
that
to
her
when
she
suddenly
disappeared
as
she
stood
before
the
counter
i
asked
the
chemist
if
he
could
tell
me
anything
about
the
lady
who
had
just
entered
his
shop
but
he
merely
turned
away
and
laughed
lady
he
said
what
are
you
talking
about
you
a
bit
out
of
your
reckoning
this
is
the
first
of
april
come
what
do
you
want
i
bought
a
bottle
of
formamints
and
reluctantly
and
regretfully
turned
away
that
night
i
dreamed
i
again
saw
the
ghost
i
followed
her
up
george
street
just
as
i
had
done
in
reality
but
when
she
came
to
the
chemist
shop
she
turned
swiftly
round
i
jane
she
said
in
a
hollow
voice
jane
only
jane
and
with
that
name
ringing
in
my
ears
i
awoke
some
days
elapsed
before
i
was
in
george
street
again
the
weather
had
in
the
meanwhile
undergone
one
of
those
sudden
and
violent
changes
so
characteristic
of
the
scottish
climate
the
of
heaven
had
been
opened
and
the
rain
was
descending
in
cataracts
the
few
pedestrians
i
encountered
were
enveloped
in
mackintoshes
and
carried
huge
umbrellas
through
which
the
rain
was
soaking
and
pouring
off
from
every
point
everything
was
wet
everywhere
was
mud
the
water
splashing
upwards
saturated
the
tops
of
my
boots
and
converted
my
trousers
into
sodden
sacks
some
weather
is
fit
for
dogs
but
this
weather
was
good
enough
for
tadpoles
even
fish
would
have
kicked
at
it
and
kept
in
their
holes
imagine
then
the
anomaly
amidst
all
this
aqueous
inferno
this
inferno
a
spotlessly
clean
apparition
in
blue
without
either
waterproof
or
umbrella
i
refer
to
jane
she
suddenly
appeared
as
i
was
passing
the
ladies
tea
association
rooms
walking
in
front
of
me
she
looked
just
the
same
as
when
i
last
saw
her
spick
and
span
and
dry
i
repeat
the
word
dry
for
that
is
what
attracted
my
attention
most
despite
the
deluge
not
a
single
raindrop
touched
her
the
plumes
on
her
toque
were
splendidly
erect
and
curly
her
sparkled
her
patent
leathers
were
spotless
whilst
the
cloth
of
her
coat
and
skirt
looked
as
sheeny
as
if
they
had
but
just
come
from
keeley
anxious
to
get
another
look
at
her
face
i
quickened
my
pace
and
darting
past
her
gazed
straight
into
her
countenance
the
result
was
a
severe
shock
the
terror
of
what
i
saw
the
ghastly
horror
of
her
dead
white
face
sent
me
reeling
across
the
pavement
i
let
her
pass
me
and
impelled
by
a
sickly
fascination
followed
in
her
wake
outside
a
jeweller
stood
a
hansom
quite
a
curiosity
in
these
days
of
motors
and
as
jane
glided
past
the
horse
shied
i
have
never
seen
an
animal
so
terrified
we
went
on
and
at
the
next
crossing
halted
a
policeman
had
his
hand
up
checking
the
traffic
his
glance
fell
on
jane
the
effect
was
electrical
his
eyes
bulged
his
cheeks
whitened
his
chest
heaved
his
hand
dropped
and
he
would
undoubtedly
have
fallen
had
not
a
good
samaritan
in
the
guise
of
a
loafer
held
him
up
jane
was
now
close
to
the
chemist
and
it
was
with
a
sigh
of
relief
that
i
saw
her
glide
in
and
disappear
had
there
been
any
doubt
at
all
after
my
first
encounter
with
jane
as
to
her
being
superphysical
there
was
certainly
none
now
the
policeman
paroxysm
of
fear
and
the
horse
fit
of
shying
were
facts
what
had
produced
them
i
alone
knew
and
i
knew
for
certain
it
was
jane
both
man
and
animal
saw
what
i
saw
hence
the
phantom
was
not
subjective
it
was
not
illusionary
it
was
a
spirit
manifestation
a
visitant
from
the
other
world
the
world
of
earthbound
souls
jane
fascinated
me
i
made
endless
researches
in
connection
with
her
and
in
answer
to
one
of
my
inquiries
i
was
informed
that
eighteen
years
ago
that
is
to
say
about
the
time
jane
dress
was
in
fashion
the
chemist
shop
had
been
occupied
by
a
dressmaker
of
the
name
of
bosworth
i
hunted
up
miss
address
and
called
on
her
she
had
retired
from
business
and
was
living
in
michael
road
bournemouth
i
came
to
the
point
straight
can
you
give
me
any
information
i
asked
about
a
lady
whose
christian
name
was
jane
that
sounds
vague
miss
bosworth
said
i
met
a
good
many
janes
in
my
time
but
not
janes
with
pale
yellow
hair
and
white
eyebrows
and
eyelashes
and
i
described
her
in
detail
how
do
you
come
to
know
about
her
miss
bosworth
said
after
a
long
pause
because
i
replied
with
a
certain
slowness
and
deliberation
characteristic
of
me
because
i
seen
her
ghost
of
course
i
knew
miss
bosworth
was
no
sceptic
the
moment
my
eyes
rested
on
her
i
saw
she
was
psychic
and
that
the
superphysical
was
often
at
her
elbow
accordingly
i
was
not
in
the
least
surprised
at
her
look
of
horror
what
she
exclaimed
is
she
still
there
i
thought
she
would
surely
be
at
rest
now
who
was
she
i
inquired
come
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
me
i
have
come
here
solely
because
the
occult
has
always
interested
me
who
was
jane
and
why
should
her
ghost
haunt
george
street
it
happened
a
good
many
years
ago
miss
bosworth
replied
in
in
answer
to
an
advertisement
i
saw
in
one
of
the
daily
papers
i
called
on
a
miss
jane
vernelt
mademoiselle
vernelt
she
called
herself
who
ran
a
costumier
business
in
george
street
in
the
very
building
in
fact
now
occupied
by
the
chemist
you
have
mentioned
the
business
was
for
sale
and
miss
vernelt
wanted
a
big
sum
for
it
however
as
her
books
showed
a
very
satisfactory
annual
increase
in
receipts
and
her
clientele
included
a
duchess
and
other
society
leaders
i
considered
the
bargain
a
tolerably
safe
one
and
we
came
to
terms
within
a
week
i
was
running
the
business
and
exactly
a
month
after
i
had
taken
it
over
i
was
greatly
astonished
to
receive
a
visit
from
miss
vernelt
she
came
into
the
shop
quite
beside
herself
with
agitation
all
a
mistake
she
screamed
did
want
to
sell
it
i
ca
do
anything
with
my
capital
let
me
buy
it
back
i
listened
to
her
politely
and
then
informed
her
that
as
i
had
gone
to
all
the
trouble
of
taking
over
the
business
and
had
already
succeeded
in
extending
it
i
most
certainly
had
no
intention
of
selling
it
at
least
not
for
some
time
well
she
behaved
like
a
lunatic
and
in
the
end
created
such
a
disturbance
that
i
had
to
summon
my
assistants
and
actually
turn
her
out
after
that
i
had
no
peace
for
six
weeks
she
came
every
day
at
any
and
all
times
and
i
was
at
last
obliged
to
take
legal
proceedings
i
then
discovered
that
her
mind
was
really
unhinged
and
that
she
had
been
suffering
from
softening
of
the
brain
for
many
months
her
medical
advisers
had
it
appeared
warned
her
to
give
up
business
and
place
herself
in
the
hands
of
trustworthy
friends
or
relations
who
would
see
that
her
money
was
properly
invested
but
she
had
delayed
doing
so
and
when
at
last
she
did
make
up
her
mind
to
retire
the
excitement
resulting
from
so
great
a
change
in
her
mode
of
living
accelerated
the
disease
and
exactly
three
weeks
after
the
sale
of
her
business
she
became
a
victim
to
the
delusion
that
she
was
ruined
this
delusion
grew
more
and
more
pronounced
as
her
malady
increased
and
amidst
her
wildest
ravings
she
clamoured
to
be
taken
back
to
george
street
the
hauntings
indeed
began
before
she
died
and
i
frequently
saw
her
when
i
knew
her
material
body
to
be
under
restraint
just
as
you
describe
gliding
in
and
out
the
for
several
weeks
after
her
death
the
manifestations
continued
they
then
ceased
and
i
have
never
heard
of
her
again
until
now
if
i
remember
rightly
the
account
of
the
george
street
ghost
here
terminated
but
my
friend
referred
to
it
again
at
the
close
of
his
letter
since
my
return
to
scotland
he
wrote
i
have
frequently
visited
george
street
almost
daily
but
i
have
not
seen
i
only
hope
that
her
poor
distracted
spirit
has
at
last
found
rest
and
with
this
kindly
sentiment
my
correspondent
concluded
case
v
the
woman
of
no
forrest
road
edinburgh
the
public
unfortunately
includes
a
certain
set
of
people
of
the
middle
class
very
middlish
who
are
ever
on
the
for
some
opportunity
however
slight
and
seemingly
remote
of
bettering
themselves
socially
and
learning
that
those
in
a
higher
strata
of
society
are
interested
in
the
supernatural
they
think
that
they
may
possibly
get
in
touch
with
them
by
working
up
a
little
local
reputation
for
psychical
research
i
have
often
had
letters
from
this
type
of
pusher
letters
from
genuine
believers
in
the
occult
i
always
welcome
stating
that
they
have
been
greatly
interested
in
my
books
would
i
be
so
very
kind
as
to
grant
them
a
brief
interview
or
permit
them
to
accompany
me
to
a
haunted
house
or
give
them
certain
information
with
regard
to
lady
whom
they
have
long
wanted
to
know
occasionally
i
have
been
so
taken
in
as
to
give
permission
to
the
writer
to
call
on
me
and
almost
always
i
have
bitterly
repented
the
wily
one
no
matter
how
wily
can
not
conceal
the
cloven
hoof
for
long
and
he
has
either
tried
to
thrust
himself
into
the
bosom
of
my
family
or
has
written
to
my
neighbours
declaring
himself
to
be
my
dearest
friend
and
when
in
desperation
i
have
shown
him
the
cold
shoulder
he
has
attacked
me
virulently
in
some
rag
of
a
local
paper
the
proprietor
editor
or
of
which
happens
to
be
one
of
his
own
clique
i
have
even
known
an
instance
where
this
type
of
person
has
through
trickery
actually
gained
access
to
some
notoriously
haunted
house
and
from
its
owners
the
family
he
has
long
had
his
eyes
on
from
a
motive
anything
but
psychic
has
ferreted
out
the
secret
and
private
history
of
the
haunting
then
when
he
has
been
found
out
and
forced
to
see
that
his
friendship
is
not
wanted
he
has
in
revenge
for
the
slight
unblushingly
revealed
the
facts
that
were
only
entrusted
to
him
in
the
strictest
confidence
and
through
influence
with
the
lower
stratum
of
the
press
caused
a
most
glaring
and
sensational
account
of
the
ghost
to
be
published
with
such
a
case
in
view
i
can
not
be
surprised
that
possessors
of
family
ghosts
and
haunted
houses
should
show
the
greatest
reluctance
to
be
approached
on
the
subject
save
by
those
they
feel
assured
will
treat
it
with
the
utmost
delicacy
but
i
have
quoted
the
above
breach
of
confidence
merely
to
give
another
reason
for
my
constant
use
of
fictitious
names
with
regard
to
people
and
places
and
having
done
so
i
hope
to
some
purpose
i
will
proceed
with
the
following
story
miss
dulcie
vincent
some
of
whose
reminiscences
appeared
in
my
book
of
last
year
is
nearly
connected
with
lady
adela
minkon
who
owns
a
considerable
amount
of
house
property
including
no
forrest
road
in
edinburgh
and
whose
yacht
at
cowes
is
the
envy
of
all
who
have
cruised
in
her
three
years
ago
lady
adela
stayed
at
no
forrest
road
she
had
heard
that
the
house
was
haunted
and
was
anxious
to
put
it
to
the
test
lady
adela
was
perfectly
she
had
never
experienced
any
occult
phenomena
herself
but
very
rationally
she
did
not
consider
that
her
with
the
superphysical
in
any
way
negatived
the
evidence
of
those
who
declare
that
they
have
witnessed
manifestations
their
statements
she
reasoned
were
just
as
worthy
of
credence
as
hers
she
thus
commenced
her
occupation
of
the
house
with
a
perfectly
unbiased
mind
resolved
to
stay
there
for
at
least
a
year
so
as
to
give
it
a
fair
trial
the
hauntings
she
was
told
were
at
their
height
in
the
late
summer
and
early
autumn
it
is
i
think
unnecessary
to
enter
into
any
detailed
description
of
her
house
in
appearance
it
differed
very
little
if
at
all
from
those
adjoining
it
in
construction
it
was
if
anything
a
trifle
larger
the
basement
which
included
the
usual
kitchen
offices
and
cellars
was
very
dark
and
the
atmosphere
after
sunset
on
fridays
only
on
fridays
was
tainted
with
a
smell
of
damp
earth
shockingly
damp
earth
and
of
a
sweet
and
nauseating
something
that
greatly
puzzled
lady
adela
all
the
rooms
in
the
house
were
of
fair
dimensions
and
cheerful
excepting
on
this
particular
evening
of
the
week
a
distinct
gloom
settled
on
them
then
and
the
strangest
of
shadows
were
seen
playing
about
the
passages
and
on
the
landings
it
may
be
fancy
lady
adela
said
to
herself
merely
fancy
and
after
all
if
i
encounter
nothing
worse
than
a
weekly
menu
of
aromatic
smells
and
easily
digested
shadows
i
shall
not
suffer
any
harm
but
it
was
early
summer
then
the
psychic
season
had
yet
to
come
as
the
weeks
went
by
the
shadows
and
the
smell
grew
more
and
more
pronounced
and
by
the
arrival
of
august
had
become
so
emphatic
that
lady
adela
could
not
help
thinking
that
they
were
both
hostile
and
aggressive
about
eight
on
the
evening
of
the
second
friday
in
the
month
lady
adela
was
purposely
alone
in
the
basement
of
the
house
the
servants
especially
irritated
her
like
the
majority
of
domestics
products
of
the
county
council
schools
they
were
so
intensely
supercilious
and
silly
and
lady
adela
felt
that
their
presence
in
the
house
minimised
her
chances
of
seeing
the
ghost
no
apparition
with
the
smallest
amount
of
could
risk
coming
in
contact
with
such
inane
creatures
so
she
sent
them
all
out
for
a
motor
drive
and
for
once
rejoiced
in
the
house
to
herself
a
curious
proceeding
for
a
lady
true
but
then
lady
adela
was
a
lady
and
being
a
lady
was
not
afraid
of
being
thought
anything
else
and
so
acted
just
as
unconventionally
as
she
chose
but
stay
a
moment
she
was
not
alone
in
the
house
for
she
had
three
of
her
dogs
with
her
three
beautiful
boarhounds
trophies
of
her
last
trip
to
the
baltic
with
such
colossal
and
perfectly
trained
companions
lady
adela
felt
absolutely
safe
and
ready
as
she
acknowledged
afterwards
to
face
a
whole
army
of
spooks
she
did
not
even
shiver
when
the
front
door
of
the
basement
closed
and
she
heard
the
sonorous
birring
of
the
motor
drowning
the
giddy
voices
of
the
servants
grow
fainter
and
fainter
until
it
finally
ceased
altogether
when
the
last
echoes
of
the
vehicle
had
died
away
in
the
distance
lady
adela
made
a
tour
of
the
premises
the
housekeeper
room
pleased
her
immensely
at
least
she
persuaded
herself
it
did
why
it
is
quite
as
nice
as
any
of
the
rooms
upstairs
she
said
aloud
as
she
stood
with
her
face
to
the
failing
sunbeams
and
rested
her
strong
white
hand
on
the
edge
of
the
table
quite
as
nice
karl
and
max
come
here
but
the
boarhounds
for
once
in
their
lives
did
not
obey
her
with
a
good
grace
there
was
something
in
the
room
they
did
not
like
and
they
showed
how
strong
was
their
resentment
by
slinking
unwillingly
through
the
doorway
i
wonder
why
that
is
lady
adela
mused
i
have
never
known
them
do
it
before
then
her
eyes
wandered
round
the
walls
and
struggled
in
vain
to
reach
the
remoter
angles
of
the
room
which
had
suddenly
grown
dark
she
tried
to
assure
herself
that
this
was
but
the
natural
effect
of
the
departing
daylight
and
that
had
she
watched
in
other
houses
at
this
particular
time
she
would
have
noticed
the
same
thing
to
show
how
little
she
minded
the
gloom
she
went
up
to
the
darkest
corner
and
prodded
the
walls
with
her
she
laughed
there
was
nothing
there
nothing
whatsoever
to
be
afraid
of
only
shadows
with
a
careless
shrug
of
her
shoulders
she
strutted
into
the
passage
and
whistling
to
karl
and
max
who
contrary
to
their
custom
would
not
keep
to
heel
made
another
inspection
of
the
kitchens
at
the
top
of
the
cellar
steps
she
halted
the
darkness
had
now
set
in
everywhere
and
she
argued
that
it
would
be
foolish
to
venture
into
such
places
without
a
light
she
soon
found
one
and
armed
with
candle
and
matches
began
her
descent
there
were
several
cellars
and
they
presented
such
a
dismal
dark
appearance
that
she
instinctively
drew
her
skirts
tightly
round
her
and
exchanged
the
slender
for
a
poker
she
whistled
again
to
her
dogs
they
did
not
answer
so
she
called
them
both
by
name
angrily
but
for
some
reason
some
quite
unaccountable
reason
she
told
herself
they
would
not
come
she
ransacked
her
mind
to
recall
some
popular
operatic
air
and
although
she
knew
scores
she
could
not
remember
one
indeed
the
only
air
that
filtered
back
to
her
was
one
she
detested
a
vaudeville
tune
she
had
heard
three
nights
in
succession
when
she
was
staying
with
a
student
friend
in
the
latin
quarter
in
paris
she
hummed
it
loudly
however
and
holding
the
lighted
candle
high
above
her
head
walked
down
the
steps
at
the
bottom
she
stood
still
and
listened
from
high
above
her
came
noises
which
sounded
like
the
rumbling
of
distant
thunder
but
which
on
analysis
proved
to
be
the
rattling
of
reassured
that
she
had
no
cause
for
alarm
lady
adela
advanced
something
black
scudded
across
the
floor
and
she
made
a
dash
at
it
with
her
poker
the
concussion
awoke
countless
echoes
in
the
cellars
and
called
into
existence
legions
of
other
black
things
that
darted
hither
and
thither
in
all
directions
she
burst
out
laughing
they
were
only
beetles
facing
her
she
now
perceived
an
inner
cellar
which
was
far
gloomier
than
the
one
in
which
she
stood
the
ceiling
was
very
low
and
appeared
to
be
crushed
down
beneath
the
burden
of
a
stupendous
weight
and
as
she
advanced
beneath
it
she
half
expected
that
it
would
cave
in
and
bury
her
a
few
feet
from
the
centre
of
this
cellar
she
stopped
and
bending
down
examined
the
floor
carefully
the
tiles
were
unmistakably
newer
here
than
elsewhere
and
presented
the
appearance
of
having
been
put
in
at
no
very
distant
date
the
dampness
of
the
atmosphere
was
intense
a
fact
which
struck
lady
adela
as
somewhat
odd
since
the
floor
and
walls
looked
singularly
dry
to
find
out
if
this
were
the
case
she
ran
her
fingers
over
the
walls
and
on
removing
them
found
they
showed
no
signs
of
moisture
then
she
rapped
the
floor
and
walls
and
could
discover
no
indications
of
hollowness
she
sniffed
the
air
and
a
great
wave
of
something
sweet
and
sickly
half
choked
her
she
drew
out
her
handkerchief
and
beat
the
air
vigorously
with
it
but
the
smell
remained
and
she
could
not
in
any
way
account
for
it
she
turned
to
leave
the
cellar
and
the
flame
of
her
candle
burned
blue
then
for
the
first
time
that
evening
almost
indeed
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
felt
afraid
so
afraid
that
she
made
no
attempt
to
diagnose
her
fear
she
understood
the
dogs
feelings
now
and
caught
herself
wondering
how
much
they
knew
she
whistled
to
them
again
not
because
she
thought
they
would
respond
she
knew
only
too
well
they
would
not
but
because
she
wanted
company
even
the
company
of
her
own
voice
and
she
had
some
faint
hope
too
that
whatever
might
be
with
her
in
the
cellar
would
not
so
readily
disclose
itself
if
she
made
a
noise
the
one
cellar
was
passed
and
she
was
nearly
across
the
floor
of
the
other
when
she
heard
a
crash
the
candle
dropped
from
her
hand
and
all
the
blood
in
her
body
rushed
to
her
heart
she
could
never
have
imagined
it
was
so
terrible
to
be
frightened
she
tried
to
pull
herself
together
and
be
calm
but
she
was
no
longer
mistress
of
her
limbs
her
knees
knocked
together
and
her
hands
shook
it
was
only
the
dogs
she
feebly
told
herself
i
will
call
them
but
when
she
opened
her
mouth
she
found
her
throat
was
paralysed
not
a
syllable
would
come
she
knew
too
that
she
had
lied
and
that
the
hounds
could
not
have
been
responsible
for
the
noise
it
was
like
nothing
she
had
ever
heard
nothing
she
could
imagine
and
although
she
struggled
hard
against
the
idea
she
could
not
help
associating
the
sound
with
the
cause
of
the
candle
burning
blue
and
the
sweet
sickly
smell
incapable
of
moving
a
step
she
was
forced
to
listen
in
breathless
expectancy
for
a
recurrence
of
the
crash
her
thoughts
become
ghastly
the
inky
sea
of
darkness
that
hemmed
her
in
on
every
side
suggested
every
sort
of
ghoulish
possibility
and
with
each
pulsation
of
her
overstrained
heart
her
flesh
crawled
another
sound
this
time
not
a
crash
nothing
half
so
loud
or
definite
drew
her
eyes
in
the
direction
of
the
steps
an
object
was
now
standing
at
the
top
of
them
and
something
lurid
like
the
faint
phosphorescent
glow
of
decay
emanated
from
all
over
it
but
it
was
she
could
not
for
the
life
of
her
tell
it
might
have
been
the
figure
of
a
man
or
a
woman
or
a
beast
or
of
anything
that
was
inexpressibly
antagonistic
and
nasty
she
would
have
given
her
soul
to
have
looked
elsewhere
but
her
eyes
were
fixed
she
could
neither
turn
nor
shut
them
for
some
seconds
the
shape
remained
motionless
and
then
with
a
sly
subtle
motion
it
lowered
its
head
and
came
stealing
stealthily
down
the
stairs
towards
her
she
followed
its
approach
like
one
in
a
hideous
dream
her
heart
ready
to
burst
her
brain
on
the
verge
of
madness
another
step
another
yet
another
till
there
were
only
three
left
between
her
and
it
and
she
was
at
length
enabled
to
form
some
idea
of
what
the
thing
was
like
it
was
short
and
squat
and
appeared
to
be
partly
clad
in
a
loose
flowing
garment
that
was
not
long
enough
to
conceal
the
glistening
extremities
of
its
limbs
from
its
general
contour
and
the
tangled
mass
of
hair
that
fell
about
its
neck
and
shoulders
lady
adela
concluded
it
was
the
phantasm
of
a
woman
its
head
being
kept
bent
she
was
unable
to
see
the
face
in
full
but
every
instant
she
expected
the
revelation
would
take
place
and
with
each
separate
movement
of
the
phantasm
her
suspense
became
more
and
more
intolerable
at
last
it
stood
on
the
floor
of
the
cellar
a
broad
ungainly
horribly
ungainly
figure
that
glided
up
to
and
past
her
into
the
far
cellar
there
it
halted
as
nearly
as
she
could
judge
on
the
new
tiles
and
remained
standing
as
she
gazed
at
it
too
fascinated
to
remove
her
eyes
there
was
a
loud
reverberating
crash
a
hideous
sound
of
wrenching
and
tearing
and
the
whole
of
the
ceiling
of
the
inner
chamber
came
down
with
an
appalling
roar
lady
adela
thinks
that
she
must
then
have
fainted
for
she
distinctly
remembers
falling
falling
into
what
seemed
to
her
a
black
interminable
abyss
when
she
recovered
consciousness
she
was
lying
on
the
tiles
and
all
around
was
still
and
normal
she
got
up
found
and
lighted
her
candle
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
evening
without
further
adventure
in
the
all
the
week
lady
adela
struggled
hard
to
master
a
disinclination
to
spend
another
evening
alone
in
the
house
and
when
friday
came
she
succumbed
to
her
fears
the
servants
were
poor
foolish
things
but
it
was
nice
to
feel
that
there
was
something
in
the
house
besides
ghosts
she
sat
reading
in
the
till
late
that
night
and
when
she
lolled
out
of
the
window
to
take
a
farewell
look
at
the
sky
and
stars
before
retiring
to
rest
the
sounds
of
traffic
had
completely
ceased
and
the
whole
city
lay
bathed
in
a
refreshing
silence
it
was
very
heavenly
to
stand
there
and
feel
the
cool
soft
air
unaccompanied
for
the
first
time
during
the
day
by
the
rattling
rumbling
sounds
of
locomotion
and
the
jarring
discordant
murmurs
of
unmusical
voices
fanning
her
neck
and
face
lady
adela
used
as
she
was
to
the
privacy
of
her
yacht
and
the
freedom
of
her
big
country
mansion
where
all
sounds
were
regulated
at
her
will
chafed
at
the
near
proximity
of
her
present
habitation
to
the
noisy
thoroughfare
and
vaguely
looked
forward
to
the
hours
when
shops
and
theatres
were
closed
and
all
screeching
products
of
the
gutter
were
in
bed
to
her
the
nights
in
waterloo
place
were
all
too
short
the
days
too
long
too
long
for
anything
the
heavy
lumbering
steps
of
a
policeman
at
last
broke
her
reverie
she
had
no
desire
to
arouse
his
curiosity
besides
her
costume
had
become
somewhat
disordered
and
she
had
the
strictest
sense
of
propriety
at
least
in
the
presence
of
the
lower
orders
retiring
therefore
with
a
sigh
of
vexation
she
sought
her
bedroom
and
after
the
most
scrupulous
attention
to
her
toilet
put
out
the
lights
and
got
into
bed
it
was
just
one
when
she
fell
asleep
and
three
when
she
awoke
with
a
violent
start
why
she
started
puzzled
her
she
did
not
recollect
experiencing
any
very
dreadful
dream
in
fact
no
dream
at
all
and
there
seemed
nothing
in
the
hush
the
apparently
unbroken
hush
that
could
in
any
way
account
for
her
action
why
then
had
she
started
she
lay
still
and
wondered
surely
everything
was
just
as
it
was
when
she
went
to
sleep
and
yet
when
she
ventured
on
a
diagnosis
there
was
something
different
something
new
she
did
not
think
it
was
actually
in
the
atmosphere
nor
in
the
silence
she
did
not
know
where
it
was
until
she
opened
her
eyes
and
then
she
bending
over
her
within
a
few
inches
of
her
face
was
another
face
the
ghastly
caricature
of
a
human
face
it
was
on
a
larger
scale
than
that
of
any
mortal
lady
adela
had
ever
seen
it
was
long
in
proportion
to
its
width
indeed
she
could
not
make
out
where
the
cranium
terminated
at
the
back
as
the
hinder
portion
of
it
was
lost
in
a
mist
the
forehead
which
was
very
receding
was
partly
covered
with
a
mass
of
lank
black
hair
that
fell
straight
down
into
space
there
were
no
neck
nor
shoulders
at
least
none
had
materialised
the
skin
was
and
the
emaciation
so
extreme
that
the
raw
had
burst
through
in
places
the
size
of
the
eye
sockets
which
appeared
monstrous
was
emphasised
by
the
fact
that
the
eyes
were
considerably
sunken
the
lips
were
curled
downwards
and
tightly
shut
and
the
whole
expression
of
the
withered
mouth
as
indeed
that
of
the
entire
face
was
one
of
bestial
diabolical
malignity
lady
heart
momentarily
stopped
her
blood
ran
cold
she
was
petrified
and
as
she
stared
helplessly
at
the
dark
eyes
pressed
close
to
hers
she
saw
them
suddenly
suffuse
with
fiendish
glee
the
most
frightful
change
then
took
place
the
upper
lip
writhed
away
from
a
few
greenish
yellow
stumps
the
lower
jaw
fell
with
a
metallic
click
leaving
the
mouth
widely
open
and
disclosing
to
lady
adela
shocked
vision
a
black
and
bloated
tongue
the
eyeballs
rolled
up
and
entirely
disappeared
whilst
their
places
were
immediately
filled
with
the
foulest
and
most
loathsome
indications
of
advanced
decay
a
strong
vibratory
movement
suddenly
made
all
the
bones
in
the
head
rattle
and
the
tongue
wag
whilst
from
the
jaws
as
if
belched
up
from
some
well
came
a
gust
of
wind
putrescent
with
the
ravages
of
the
tomb
and
yet
at
the
same
time
tainted
with
the
same
sweet
sickly
odour
with
which
lady
adela
had
latterly
become
so
familiar
this
was
the
culminating
act
the
head
then
receded
and
growing
fainter
and
fainter
gradually
disappeared
altogether
lady
adela
was
now
more
than
satisfied
there
was
not
a
house
more
horribly
haunted
in
scotland
and
nothing
on
earth
would
induce
her
to
remain
in
it
another
night
however
being
anxious
naturally
to
discover
something
that
might
in
some
degree
account
for
the
apparitions
lady
adela
made
endless
inquiries
concerning
the
history
of
former
occupants
of
the
house
but
failing
to
find
out
anything
remarkable
in
this
direction
she
was
eventually
obliged
to
content
herself
with
the
following
tradition
it
was
said
that
on
the
site
of
no
forrest
road
there
had
once
stood
a
cottage
occupied
by
two
sisters
both
nurses
and
that
one
was
suspected
of
poisoning
the
other
and
that
the
cottage
moreover
having
through
their
parsimonious
habits
got
into
a
very
bad
state
of
repair
was
blown
down
during
a
violent
storm
the
surviving
sister
perishing
in
the
ruins
granted
that
this
story
is
correct
it
was
in
all
probability
the
ghost
of
this
latter
sister
that
appeared
to
lady
adela
her
ladyship
is
of
course
anxious
to
let
no
forrest
road
and
as
only
about
one
in
a
thousand
people
seem
to
possess
the
faculty
of
seeing
psychic
phenomena
she
hopes
she
may
one
day
succeed
in
getting
a
permanent
tenant
in
the
meanwhile
she
is
doing
her
level
best
to
suppress
the
rumour
that
the
house
is
haunted
case
vi
the
phantom
regiment
of
killiecrankie
many
are
the
stories
that
have
from
time
to
time
been
circulated
with
regard
to
the
haunting
of
the
pass
of
killiecrankie
by
phantom
soldiers
but
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
stranger
story
than
that
related
to
me
some
years
ago
by
a
lady
who
declared
she
had
actually
witnessed
the
phenomena
her
account
of
it
i
shall
reproduce
as
far
as
possible
in
her
own
words
let
me
commence
by
stating
that
i
am
not
a
spiritualist
and
that
i
have
the
greatest
possible
aversion
to
convoking
the
earthbound
souls
of
the
dead
neither
do
i
lay
any
claim
to
mediumistic
powers
indeed
i
have
always
regarded
the
term
medium
with
the
gravest
suspicion
i
am
on
the
contrary
a
plain
practical
woman
and
with
the
exception
of
this
one
occasion
never
witnessed
any
psychic
phenomena
the
incident
i
am
about
to
relate
took
place
the
autumn
before
last
i
was
on
a
cycle
tour
in
scotland
and
making
pitlochry
my
temporary
headquarters
rode
over
one
evening
to
view
the
historic
pass
of
killiecrankie
it
was
late
when
i
arrived
there
and
the
western
sky
was
one
great
splash
of
crimson
and
gold
such
vivid
colouring
i
had
never
seen
before
and
never
have
seen
since
indeed
i
was
so
entranced
at
the
sublimity
of
the
spectacle
that
i
perched
myself
on
a
rock
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
great
cliffs
that
form
the
walls
of
the
pass
and
throwing
my
head
back
imagined
myself
in
fairyland
lost
thus
in
a
delicious
luxury
i
paid
no
heed
to
the
time
nor
did
i
think
of
stirring
until
the
dark
shadows
of
the
night
fell
across
my
face
i
then
started
up
in
a
panic
and
was
about
to
pedal
off
in
hot
haste
when
a
strange
notion
suddenly
seized
me
i
had
a
latchkey
plenty
of
sandwiches
a
warm
cape
why
should
i
not
camp
out
there
till
early
morning
i
had
long
yearned
to
spend
a
night
in
the
open
now
was
my
opportunity
the
idea
was
no
sooner
conceived
than
put
into
operation
selecting
the
most
boulder
i
could
see
i
scrambled
on
to
the
top
of
it
and
with
my
cloak
drawn
tightly
over
my
back
and
shoulders
commenced
my
vigil
the
cold
mountain
air
sweet
with
the
perfume
of
gorse
and
heather
intoxicated
me
and
i
gradually
sank
into
a
heavenly
torpor
from
which
i
was
abruptly
aroused
by
a
dull
boom
that
i
at
once
associated
with
distant
musketry
all
was
then
still
still
as
the
grave
and
on
glancing
at
the
watch
i
wore
strapped
on
my
wrist
i
saw
it
was
two
a
species
of
nervous
dread
now
laid
hold
of
me
and
a
thousand
and
one
vague
fancies
all
the
more
distressing
because
of
their
vagueness
oppressed
and
disconcerted
me
moreover
i
was
impressed
for
the
first
time
with
the
extraordinary
solitude
solitude
that
seemed
to
belong
to
a
period
far
other
than
the
present
and
as
i
glanced
around
at
the
solitary
pines
and
gleaming
boulders
i
more
than
half
expected
to
see
the
wild
ferocious
face
of
some
robber
chief
some
fierce
yet
fascinating
hero
of
sir
walter
scott
peering
at
me
from
behind
them
this
feeling
at
length
became
so
acute
that
in
a
panic
of
fear
ridiculous
puerile
fear
i
forcibly
withdrew
my
gaze
and
concentrated
it
abstractedly
on
the
ground
at
my
feet
i
then
listened
and
in
the
rustling
of
a
leaf
the
humming
of
some
night
insect
the
whizzing
of
a
bat
the
whispering
of
the
wind
as
it
moaned
softly
past
me
i
fancied
nay
i
felt
sure
i
detected
something
that
was
not
ordinary
i
blew
my
nose
and
had
barely
ceased
marvelling
at
the
loudness
of
its
reverberations
before
the
piercing
ghoulish
shriek
of
an
owl
sent
the
blood
in
torrents
to
my
heart
i
then
laughed
and
my
blood
froze
as
i
heard
a
chorus
of
what
i
tried
to
persuade
myself
could
only
be
echoes
proceed
from
every
crag
and
rock
in
the
valley
for
some
seconds
after
this
i
sat
still
hardly
daring
to
breathe
and
pretending
to
be
extremely
angry
with
myself
for
being
such
a
fool
with
a
stupendous
effort
i
turned
my
attention
to
the
most
material
of
things
one
of
the
skirt
buttons
on
my
hip
they
were
much
in
vogue
then
being
loose
i
endeavoured
to
occupy
myself
in
tightening
it
and
when
i
could
no
longer
derive
any
employment
from
that
i
set
to
work
on
my
shoes
and
tied
knots
in
the
laces
merely
to
enjoy
the
task
of
untying
them
but
this
too
ceasing
at
last
to
attract
me
i
was
desperately
racking
my
mind
for
some
other
device
when
there
came
again
the
queer
booming
noise
i
had
heard
before
but
which
i
could
now
no
longer
doubt
was
the
report
of
firearms
i
looked
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
and
my
heart
almost
stopped
racing
towards
me
as
if
not
merely
for
his
life
but
his
soul
came
the
figure
of
a
highlander
the
wind
rustling
through
his
long
dishevelled
hair
blew
it
completely
over
his
forehead
narrowly
missing
his
eyes
which
were
fixed
ahead
of
him
in
a
ghastly
agonised
stare
he
had
not
a
vestige
of
colour
and
in
the
powerful
glow
of
the
moonbeams
his
skin
shone
livid
he
ran
with
huge
bounds
and
what
added
to
my
terror
and
made
me
double
aware
he
was
nothing
mortal
was
that
each
time
his
feet
struck
the
hard
smooth
road
upon
which
i
could
well
see
there
was
no
sign
of
a
stone
there
came
the
sound
the
unmistakable
sound
of
the
scattering
of
gravel
on
on
he
came
with
cyclonic
swiftness
his
bare
sweating
elbows
pressed
into
his
panting
sides
his
great
dirty
coarse
hairy
fists
screwed
up
in
bony
bunches
in
front
of
him
the
thick
on
his
clenched
grinning
lips
the
oozing
down
his
sweating
thighs
it
was
all
real
infernally
hideously
real
even
to
the
most
minute
details
the
flying
up
and
down
of
his
kilt
sporan
and
swordless
scabbard
the
bursting
of
the
seam
of
his
coat
near
the
shoulder
and
the
absence
of
one
of
his
clumsy
i
tried
hard
to
shut
my
eyes
but
was
compelled
to
keep
them
open
and
follow
his
every
movement
as
darting
past
me
he
left
the
roadway
and
leaping
several
of
the
smaller
obstacles
that
barred
his
way
finally
disappeared
behind
some
of
the
bigger
boulders
i
then
heard
the
loud
of
drums
accompanied
by
the
shrill
voices
of
fifes
and
flutes
and
at
the
farther
end
of
the
pass
their
arms
glittering
brightly
in
the
silvery
moonbeams
appeared
a
regiment
of
soldiers
at
the
head
rode
a
mounted
officer
after
him
came
the
band
and
then
four
abreast
a
long
line
of
warriors
in
their
centre
two
ensigns
and
on
their
flanks
officers
and
officers
with
swords
and
pikes
more
mounted
men
bringing
up
the
rear
on
they
came
the
fifes
and
flutes
ringing
out
with
a
weird
clearness
in
the
hushed
mountain
air
i
could
hear
the
ground
vibrate
the
gravel
crunch
and
scatter
as
they
steadily
and
mechanically
advanced
tall
men
enormously
tall
men
with
set
white
faces
and
livid
eyes
every
instant
i
expected
they
would
see
me
and
i
became
sick
with
terror
at
the
thought
of
meeting
all
those
pale
flashing
eyes
but
from
this
i
was
happily
saved
no
one
appeared
to
notice
me
and
they
all
passed
me
by
without
as
much
as
a
twist
or
turn
of
the
head
their
feet
keeping
time
to
one
everlasting
and
monotonous
tramp
tramp
tramp
i
got
up
and
watched
until
the
last
of
them
had
turned
the
bend
of
the
pass
and
the
sheen
of
his
weapons
and
trappings
could
no
longer
be
seen
then
i
remounted
my
boulder
and
wondered
if
anything
further
would
happen
it
was
now
two
and
blended
with
the
moonbeams
was
a
peculiar
whiteness
which
rendered
the
whole
aspect
of
my
surroundings
indescribably
dreary
and
ghostly
feeling
cold
and
hungry
i
set
to
work
on
my
beef
sandwiches
and
was
religiously
separating
the
fat
from
the
lean
for
i
am
one
of
those
foolish
people
who
detest
fat
when
a
loud
rustling
made
me
look
up
confronting
me
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
was
a
tree
an
ash
and
to
my
surprise
despite
the
fact
that
the
breeze
had
fallen
and
there
was
scarcely
a
breath
of
wind
the
tree
swayed
violently
to
and
fro
whilst
there
proceeded
from
it
the
most
dreadful
moanings
and
groanings
i
was
so
terrified
that
i
caught
hold
of
my
bicycle
and
tried
to
mount
but
i
was
obliged
to
desist
as
i
had
not
a
particle
of
strength
in
my
limbs
then
to
assure
myself
the
moving
of
the
tree
was
not
an
illusion
i
rubbed
my
eyes
pinched
myself
called
aloud
but
it
made
no
difference
the
rustling
bending
and
tossing
still
continued
summing
up
courage
i
stepped
into
the
road
to
get
a
closer
view
when
to
my
horror
my
feet
kicked
against
something
and
on
looking
down
i
perceived
the
body
of
an
english
soldier
with
a
ghastly
wound
in
his
chest
i
gazed
around
and
there
on
all
sides
of
me
from
one
end
of
the
valley
to
the
other
lay
dozens
of
bodies
bodies
of
men
and
horses
highlanders
and
english
lurid
eyes
and
a
of
livid
gory
awfulness
here
was
the
writhing
wriggling
figure
of
an
officer
with
half
his
face
shot
away
and
there
a
horse
with
no
head
and
there
but
i
can
not
dwell
on
such
horrors
the
very
memory
of
which
makes
me
feel
sick
and
faint
the
air
that
beautiful
fresh
mountain
air
resounded
with
their
moanings
and
groanings
and
reeked
with
the
smell
of
their
blood
as
i
stood
rooted
to
the
ground
with
horror
not
knowing
which
way
to
look
or
turn
i
suddenly
saw
drop
from
the
ash
the
form
of
a
woman
a
highland
girl
with
bold
handsome
features
raven
black
hair
and
the
whitest
of
arms
and
feet
in
one
hand
she
carried
a
wicker
basket
in
the
other
a
knife
a
knife
a
gleam
of
avarice
and
cruelty
came
into
her
large
dark
eyes
as
wandering
around
her
they
rested
on
the
rich
facings
of
the
english
officers
uniforms
i
knew
what
was
in
her
mind
and
forgetting
she
was
but
a
ghost
that
they
were
all
ghosts
i
moved
heaven
and
earth
to
stop
her
i
could
not
making
straight
for
a
wounded
officer
that
lay
moaning
piteously
on
the
ground
some
ten
feet
away
from
me
she
spurned
with
her
slender
graceful
feet
the
bodies
of
the
dead
and
dying
english
that
came
in
her
way
then
snatching
the
officer
sword
and
pistol
from
him
she
knelt
down
and
with
a
look
of
devilish
glee
in
her
glorious
eyes
calmly
plunged
her
knife
into
his
heart
working
the
blade
backwards
and
forwards
to
assure
herself
she
had
made
a
thorough
job
of
it
anything
more
hellish
i
could
not
have
imagined
and
yet
it
fascinated
me
the
girl
was
so
fair
so
wickedly
fair
and
shapely
her
act
of
cruelty
over
she
spoiled
her
victim
of
his
rings
epaulets
buttons
and
gold
lacing
and
having
placed
them
in
her
basket
proceeded
elsewhere
in
some
cases
unable
to
remove
the
rings
easily
she
chopped
off
the
fingers
and
popped
them
just
as
they
were
into
her
basket
neither
was
her
mode
of
dispatch
always
the
same
for
while
she
put
some
men
out
of
their
misery
in
the
manner
i
have
described
she
cut
the
throats
of
others
with
as
great
a
nonchalance
as
if
she
had
been
killing
fowls
whilst
others
again
she
settled
with
the
of
their
guns
or
pistols
in
all
she
murdered
a
full
and
was
decamping
with
her
booty
when
her
gloating
eyes
suddenly
encountered
mine
and
with
a
shrill
scream
of
rage
she
rushed
towards
me
i
was
an
easy
victim
for
strain
and
pray
how
i
would
i
could
not
move
an
inch
raising
her
flashing
blade
high
over
her
head
an
expression
of
fiendish
glee
in
her
staring
eyes
she
made
ready
to
strike
me
this
was
the
climax
my
overstrained
nerves
could
stand
no
more
and
ere
the
blow
had
time
to
descend
i
pitched
heavily
forward
and
fell
at
her
feet
when
i
recovered
every
phantom
had
vanished
and
the
pass
glowed
with
all
the
cheerful
freshness
of
the
early
morning
sun
not
a
whit
the
worse
for
my
venture
i
cycled
swiftly
home
and
ate
as
only
one
can
eat
who
has
spent
the
night
amid
the
banks
and
braes
of
bonnie
scotland
case
vii
pearlin
jean
of
allanbank
few
ghosts
have
obtained
more
notoriety
than
pearlin
jean
the
phantasm
which
for
many
years
haunted
allanbank
a
seat
of
the
stuarts
the
popular
theory
as
to
the
identity
of
the
apparition
is
as
follows
stuart
afterwards
created
first
baronet
of
allanbank
when
on
a
tour
in
france
met
a
young
and
beautiful
french
sister
of
charity
of
the
name
of
jean
whom
he
induced
to
leave
her
convent
tiring
of
her
at
length
stuart
brutally
left
her
and
returning
abruptly
to
scotland
became
engaged
to
be
married
to
a
lady
of
his
own
nationality
and
position
in
life
but
jean
was
determined
he
should
not
escape
her
so
easily
for
him
she
had
sacrificed
everything
her
old
vocation
in
life
was
gone
she
had
no
home
no
honour
nothing
so
she
resolved
to
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
discover
his
whereabouts
at
last
her
perseverance
was
rewarded
and
fortune
favouring
her
she
arrived
without
mishap
at
allanbank
the
truth
was
then
revealed
to
her
her
cruel
and
faithless
lover
was
about
to
be
wedded
to
another
but
despair
gave
her
energy
and
burning
with
indignation
she
hastened
to
his
house
to
upbraid
him
she
reached
the
spot
just
as
he
was
driving
out
with
his
fiancée
with
a
cry
of
anguish
jean
rushed
forward
and
swinging
herself
nimbly
on
to
the
of
the
coach
turned
her
white
and
passionate
face
towards
its
occupants
for
a
moment
stuart
was
too
dumbfounded
to
do
anything
he
could
scarcely
believe
his
senses
who
on
earth
was
this
frantic
female
good
heavens
jean
impossible
how
on
earth
had
she
got
there
and
the
tumultuous
beating
of
his
guilty
heart
turned
him
sick
and
faint
then
he
glanced
fearfully
and
covertly
at
his
fiancée
must
not
know
the
truth
at
any
cost
possibly
he
lost
his
head
at
all
events
that
is
the
kindest
construction
to
put
on
his
subsequent
action
for
dastardly
as
his
behaviour
had
been
to
jean
in
the
past
one
can
hardly
imagine
him
capable
of
deliberately
murdering
her
and
in
so
horrible
a
fashion
there
was
not
a
second
to
lose
an
instant
more
and
the
secret
that
he
had
so
assiduously
hidden
from
the
lady
beside
him
would
be
revealed
jean
mouth
was
already
open
to
speak
he
waved
her
aside
she
adhered
to
her
post
he
shouted
to
the
postilion
and
the
huge
lumbering
vehicle
was
set
in
motion
at
the
first
turn
of
the
wheels
jean
slipped
from
her
perch
her
dress
caught
in
the
spokes
and
she
was
crushed
to
death
her
fate
does
not
appear
to
have
made
any
deep
impression
either
on
stuart
or
his
for
they
continued
their
drive
the
hauntings
began
that
autumn
stuart
as
was
only
fit
and
proper
being
the
first
to
witness
the
phenomenon
returning
home
from
a
drive
one
evening
he
perceived
to
his
surprise
the
dark
outlines
of
a
human
figure
perched
on
the
arched
gateway
of
his
house
exactly
opposite
the
spot
where
jean
had
perished
wondering
who
it
could
be
he
leaned
forward
to
inspect
it
closer
the
figure
moved
an
icy
current
of
air
ran
through
him
and
he
saw
to
his
horror
the
livid
countenance
of
the
dead
jean
there
she
was
staring
down
at
him
with
lurid
glassy
eyes
her
cheeks
startlingly
white
her
hair
fluttering
in
the
wind
her
neck
and
forehead
bathed
in
blood
paralysed
with
terror
stuart
could
not
remove
his
gaze
and
it
was
not
until
one
of
the
menials
opened
the
carriage
door
to
assist
him
down
that
the
spell
was
broken
and
he
was
able
to
speak
and
move
he
then
flew
into
the
house
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
night
in
the
most
abject
fear
after
this
he
had
no
peace
allanbank
was
constantly
haunted
the
great
oak
doors
opened
and
shut
of
their
own
accord
at
night
with
loud
clanging
and
bangs
and
the
rustling
of
silks
and
pattering
of
shoes
were
heard
in
the
bedrooms
and
along
the
many
dark
and
winding
passages
from
her
attire
which
was
a
piece
of
lace
made
of
thread
the
apparition
became
known
as
pearlin
jean
and
a
portrait
of
her
was
actually
painted
it
is
recorded
that
when
this
picture
was
hung
between
one
of
stuart
and
his
the
hauntings
ceased
but
that
as
soon
as
it
was
removed
they
were
renewed
presumably
it
was
not
allowed
to
remain
in
the
aforesaid
position
long
for
the
manifestations
appear
to
have
gone
on
for
many
years
without
intermission
most
phantasms
of
the
dead
inspire
those
who
see
them
with
horror
and
that
is
my
own
experience
but
pearlin
jean
seems
to
have
been
an
exception
to
this
rule
a
housekeeper
called
betty
norrie
who
lived
for
many
years
at
allanbank
declared
that
other
people
besides
herself
had
so
frequently
seen
jean
that
they
had
grown
quite
accustomed
to
her
and
were
consequently
no
more
alarmed
at
her
appearance
than
they
were
by
her
noises
another
servant
at
the
house
of
the
name
of
jenny
blackadder
used
constantly
to
hear
jean
but
could
never
see
her
though
her
husband
did
the
latter
when
courting
jenny
received
a
rare
scare
which
suggests
to
me
that
jean
in
spite
of
her
tragic
ending
may
not
have
been
without
a
spice
of
humour
thomas
for
that
was
the
swain
name
made
an
assignation
one
night
to
meet
jenny
in
the
orchard
at
allanbank
it
was
early
when
he
arrived
at
the
for
thomas
like
all
true
lovers
was
ever
rather
more
than
punctual
and
he
fully
contemplated
a
long
wait
judge
then
of
his
astonishment
when
he
perceived
in
the
moonlight
what
he
took
to
be
the
and
adored
figure
of
his
with
a
cry
of
delight
thomas
rushed
forward
and
swinging
his
arms
widely
open
to
embrace
her
beheld
her
vanish
and
found
himself
hugging
space
an
icy
current
of
air
thrilled
through
him
and
the
whole
place
trees
nooks
moonbeams
and
shadows
underwent
a
hideous
metamorphosis
the
very
air
bristled
with
unknown
horrors
till
flesh
and
blood
could
stand
no
more
and
even
at
the
risk
of
displeasing
his
beloved
jenny
thomas
fled
some
few
minutes
later
at
the
appointed
hour
jenny
arrived
on
the
scene
and
no
one
was
there
she
dallied
for
some
time
wondering
whatever
could
have
happened
to
thomas
and
then
returned
full
of
grave
apprehensions
to
the
house
it
was
not
until
the
next
morning
that
the
truth
leaked
out
and
jenny
after
indulging
in
a
hearty
laugh
at
her
lover
who
felt
very
shamefaced
now
that
it
was
daylight
sensibly
forgave
him
and
raised
no
obstacle
when
asked
to
fix
a
day
for
their
marriage
in
after
years
jenny
used
to
retail
the
story
with
many
harrowing
allusions
to
pearlin
jean
whom
she
somewhat
foolishly
made
use
of
as
a
bogey
to
frighten
children
into
being
good
a
sharpe
who
when
he
was
a
little
boy
was
once
placed
in
her
charge
confesses
that
he
was
dreadfully
scared
at
her
stories
and
that
he
never
ventured
down
a
passage
in
those
days
without
thinking
pearlin
jean
with
her
ghostly
face
clawlike
hands
and
rustling
lace
dress
was
after
him
nurse
jenny
used
to
tell
him
that
the
stuarts
tried
in
vain
to
lay
jean
spirit
actually
going
to
the
length
of
calling
in
seven
ministers
to
exorcise
it
but
all
to
no
purpose
it
still
continued
its
nocturnal
peregrinations
in
the
year
the
stuarts
let
the
house
to
strangers
who
when
they
took
it
had
not
the
least
idea
that
it
was
haunted
however
they
did
not
long
remain
in
ignorance
for
two
ladies
who
occupied
the
same
bedroom
were
awakened
in
the
night
by
hearing
some
one
walking
across
the
floor
the
presence
did
not
suggest
burglars
for
the
intruder
behaved
in
the
most
noisy
manner
pacing
restlessly
and
apparently
aimlessly
backwards
and
forwards
across
the
room
swishing
the
floor
with
what
sounded
like
a
long
lace
train
and
breathing
heavily
they
were
both
terrified
and
so
cold
that
they
could
hear
one
another
teeth
chatter
they
were
too
frightened
to
call
for
help
they
could
only
lie
still
hoping
and
praying
it
would
not
come
nearer
to
them
the
sufferings
of
these
two
ladies
were
indescribable
for
the
ghost
remained
in
their
room
all
night
moving
restlessly
about
until
daybreak
it
was
not
until
some
days
later
when
other
people
in
the
house
had
experienced
the
phenomenon
that
they
were
told
the
story
of
the
notorious
pearlin
jean
but
was
the
pearlin
jean
really
the
apparition
of
the
murdered
french
woman
to
my
mind
her
identity
with
that
of
the
beautiful
sister
of
charity
has
not
been
satisfactorily
established
and
i
think
there
are
reasons
to
doubt
it
if
for
instance
the
apparition
were
that
of
a
sister
of
charity
why
should
it
appear
incongruously
attired
in
a
long
trailing
gown
of
lace
and
if
it
were
that
of
a
woman
of
the
presumably
staid
habits
of
a
sister
of
charity
why
should
it
delight
in
mischief
and
play
the
pranks
of
a
and
yet
if
it
was
the
ghost
of
jean
whose
ghost
was
it
case
viii
the
drummer
of
cortachy
what
ancient
scottish
or
irish
family
has
not
its
family
ghost
a
banshee
the
heritage
of
niall
of
the
nine
hostages
is
still
the
unenviable
possession
of
his
descendants
the
and
i
who
am
a
member
of
the
clan
have
both
seen
and
heard
it
several
times
as
it
appears
to
me
it
resembles
the
decapitated
head
of
a
prehistoric
woman
and
i
shall
never
forget
my
feelings
one
night
when
aroused
from
slumber
by
its
ghastly
wailing
i
stumbled
frantically
out
of
bed
and
groping
my
way
upstairs
in
the
dark
without
venturing
to
look
to
the
left
or
right
lest
i
should
see
something
horrible
found
every
inmate
of
the
house
huddled
together
on
the
landing
paralysed
with
fear
i
did
not
see
it
on
that
occasion
but
on
the
following
morning
as
i
had
anticipated
i
received
the
news
that
a
near
and
dear
relative
had
died
possessing
such
an
heirloom
myself
i
can
therefore
readily
sympathise
with
those
who
own
a
similar
treasure
such
for
example
as
the
famous
or
rather
infamous
drummer
of
cortachy
castle
who
is
invariably
heard
beating
a
tattoo
before
the
death
of
a
member
of
the
clan
of
ogilvie
crowe
in
her
side
of
referring
to
the
haunting
says
miss
a
relative
of
the
present
lady
who
had
been
staying
some
time
with
the
earl
and
countess
at
their
seat
near
dundee
was
invited
to
spend
a
few
days
at
cortachy
castle
with
the
earl
and
countess
of
airlie
she
went
and
whilst
she
was
dressing
for
dinner
the
first
evening
of
her
arrival
she
heard
a
strain
of
music
under
her
window
which
finally
resolved
itself
into
a
sound
of
a
drum
when
her
maid
came
upstairs
she
made
some
inquiries
about
the
drummer
that
was
playing
near
the
house
but
the
maid
knew
nothing
on
the
subject
for
the
moment
the
circumstance
passed
from
miss
mind
but
recurring
to
her
again
during
the
dinner
she
said
addressing
lord
airlie
lord
who
is
your
drummer
upon
which
his
lordship
turned
pale
lady
airlie
looked
distressed
and
several
of
the
company
who
all
heard
the
question
embarrassed
whilst
the
lady
perceiving
that
she
had
made
some
unpleasant
allusion
although
she
knew
not
to
what
their
feelings
referred
forebore
further
inquiry
till
she
reached
the
when
having
mentioned
the
circumstance
again
to
a
member
of
the
family
she
was
answered
have
you
never
heard
of
the
drummer
boy
replied
miss
in
the
world
is
he
replied
the
other
is
a
person
who
goes
about
the
house
playing
his
drum
whenever
there
is
a
death
impending
in
the
family
the
last
time
he
was
heard
was
shortly
before
the
death
of
the
last
countess
the
earl
former
wife
and
that
is
why
lord
airlie
became
so
pale
when
you
mentioned
it
the
drummer
boy
is
a
very
unpleasant
subject
in
this
family
i
assure
you
miss
was
naturally
much
concerned
and
indeed
not
a
little
frightened
at
this
explanation
and
her
alarm
being
augmented
by
hearing
the
sounds
on
the
following
day
she
took
her
departure
from
cortachy
castle
and
returned
to
lord
where
she
related
this
strange
circumstance
to
the
family
through
whom
the
information
reached
me
this
affair
was
very
generally
known
in
the
north
and
we
awaited
the
event
with
interest
the
melancholy
death
of
the
countess
about
five
or
six
months
afterwards
at
brighton
sadly
verified
the
prognostications
i
have
heard
that
a
paper
was
found
in
her
desk
after
her
death
declaring
her
conviction
that
the
drum
was
for
her
crowe
goes
on
to
explain
the
origin
of
the
phenomenon
according
to
legend
she
says
there
was
once
at
cortachy
a
drummer
who
incurring
the
jealousy
of
the
then
lord
airlie
was
thrust
into
his
own
drum
and
flung
from
a
window
of
the
tower
in
which
by
the
way
miss
slept
before
being
put
to
death
thus
the
drummer
is
stated
to
have
said
he
would
for
ever
after
haunt
the
airlie
family
a
threat
he
has
obviously
been
permitted
to
fulfil
during
one
of
my
visits
to
scotland
i
stayed
some
days
in
forfarshire
not
far
from
cortachy
among
the
visitors
at
my
hotel
was
a
very
old
gentleman
of
the
name
of
porter
who
informed
me
that
when
a
boy
he
used
to
visit
some
relatives
who
at
that
time
lived
within
easy
walking
distance
of
cortachy
one
of
these
relatives
was
a
lad
of
about
fourteen
named
alec
with
whom
he
had
always
been
the
closest
of
friends
the
recollection
of
their
many
adventures
evidently
afforded
porter
infinite
amusement
and
one
of
these
adventures
in
particular
he
told
me
was
as
fresh
in
his
mind
as
if
it
had
happened
yesterday
looking
back
upon
it
now
he
said
with
a
look
in
his
eyes
it
certainly
was
a
strange
coincidence
and
if
you
are
interested
in
the
hauntings
of
cortachy
you
may
perhaps
like
to
hear
the
account
of
my
ghostly
experiences
in
that
neighbourhood
of
course
i
replied
that
nothing
would
give
me
greater
pleasure
and
porter
forthwith
began
his
story
one
misty
night
in
october
my
friend
alec
and
i
both
being
keen
on
rabbiting
determined
to
visit
a
spinney
adjoining
the
cortachy
estate
in
pursuit
of
our
quarry
alec
had
chosen
this
particular
night
thinking
under
cover
of
the
mist
to
escape
the
vigilance
of
the
keepers
who
had
more
than
once
threatened
to
take
him
before
the
laird
for
trespassing
to
gain
access
to
the
spinney
we
had
to
climb
a
granite
wall
and
drop
on
the
other
side
the
drop
in
addition
to
being
steep
being
rendered
all
the
more
precarious
by
reason
of
the
the
keepers
were
in
the
habit
of
setting
when
i
got
astride
the
wall
and
peered
into
the
darkness
at
our
feet
and
heard
the
grim
rustling
of
the
wind
through
the
giant
pines
ahead
of
me
i
would
have
given
all
i
possessed
to
have
found
myself
snug
and
warm
in
bed
but
alec
was
of
a
different
he
had
come
prepared
for
excitement
and
he
meant
to
have
it
for
some
seconds
we
both
waited
on
the
wall
in
breathless
silence
and
then
alec
with
a
reckless
disregard
of
what
might
be
in
store
for
him
gently
let
himself
drop
and
i
fearing
more
if
anything
than
the
present
danger
to
be
for
ever
after
branded
as
a
coward
if
i
held
back
timidly
followed
suit
by
a
great
stroke
of
luck
we
alighted
in
safety
on
a
soft
carpeting
of
moss
not
a
word
was
spoken
but
falling
on
hands
and
knees
and
guiding
ourselves
by
means
of
a
dark
lantern
alec
had
bought
from
the
village
blacksmith
we
crept
on
along
a
tiny
path
that
after
innumerable
windings
eventually
brought
us
into
a
broad
glade
shut
in
on
all
sides
by
lofty
trees
alec
prospected
the
spot
first
of
all
to
see
no
keepers
were
about
and
we
then
crawled
into
it
and
approaching
the
nearest
burrows
set
to
work
at
once
with
our
ferrets
three
rabbits
were
captured
in
this
fashion
and
we
were
eagerly
anticipating
the
taking
of
more
when
a
sensation
of
icy
coldness
suddenly
stole
over
us
and
on
looking
round
we
perceived
to
our
utmost
consternation
a
very
tall
keeper
standing
only
a
few
yards
away
from
us
for
once
in
a
way
alec
was
nonplussed
and
a
deathly
silence
ensued
it
was
too
dark
for
us
to
see
the
figure
of
the
keeper
very
distinctly
and
we
could
only
distinguish
a
gleaming
white
face
set
on
a
very
slight
and
perpendicular
frame
and
a
round
glittering
something
that
puzzled
us
both
exceedingly
then
a
feeling
that
perhaps
it
was
not
a
keeper
gradually
stole
over
me
and
in
a
paroxysm
of
ungovernable
terror
i
caught
hold
of
alec
who
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
as
if
he
had
the
ague
the
figure
remained
absolutely
still
for
about
a
minute
during
which
time
neither
alec
nor
i
could
move
a
muscle
and
then
turning
round
with
an
abrupt
movement
came
towards
us
with
fright
but
only
too
thankful
to
find
that
we
had
now
regained
the
use
of
our
limbs
we
left
our
spoil
and
ran
for
our
lives
in
the
direction
of
the
wall
we
dared
not
look
back
but
we
knew
the
figure
followed
us
for
we
heard
its
footsteps
close
at
our
heels
and
never
to
my
dying
day
shall
i
forget
the
sound
tat
tat
for
all
the
world
like
the
beat
of
a
muffled
drum
how
we
ever
managed
to
reach
the
wall
i
could
never
tell
but
as
we
scrambled
over
it
regardless
of
and
bruises
and
plunged
into
the
heather
on
the
other
side
we
heard
the
weird
footsteps
receding
in
the
direction
of
the
castle
and
ere
we
had
reached
home
the
tat
tat
had
completely
died
away
we
told
no
one
a
word
of
what
had
happened
and
a
few
days
after
simultaneously
with
the
death
of
one
of
the
airlies
we
learned
for
the
first
time
the
story
of
the
phantom
drummer
i
have
little
doubt
porter
added
in
conclusion
that
the
figure
we
took
to
be
a
keeper
was
the
prophetic
drummer
for
i
can
assure
you
there
was
no
possibility
of
hoaxers
especially
in
such
guise
anywhere
near
the
cortachy
estate
poor
old
porter
he
did
not
long
survive
our
when
i
next
visited
the
hotel
some
months
later
i
was
genuinely
grieved
to
hear
of
his
decease
his
story
had
greatly
fascinated
me
for
i
love
the
solitude
of
the
pines
and
have
myself
from
time
to
time
witnessed
many
remarkable
occult
phenomena
under
the
shadow
of
their
lofty
summits
one
night
during
this
second
visit
of
mine
to
the
hotel
the
mood
to
ramble
came
upon
me
and
unable
to
resist
the
seductive
thought
of
a
midnight
stroll
across
the
hills
i
borrowed
a
latchkey
and
armed
with
a
flask
of
whisky
and
a
thick
stick
plunged
into
the
moonlit
night
the
keen
air
acted
like
a
tonic
i
felt
younger
and
stronger
than
i
had
felt
for
years
and
i
congratulated
myself
that
my
friends
would
hardly
know
me
if
they
saw
me
now
as
i
swung
along
with
the
resuscitated
stride
of
twenty
years
ago
the
landscape
for
miles
around
stood
out
with
startling
clearness
in
the
moonshine
and
i
stopped
every
now
and
then
to
drink
in
the
beauties
of
the
glittering
and
silent
glimmering
tarns
not
a
soul
was
about
and
i
found
myself
as
i
loved
to
be
the
only
human
element
in
the
midst
of
nature
every
now
and
then
a
dark
patch
fluttered
across
the
shining
road
and
with
a
weird
and
plaintive
cry
a
night
bird
dashed
abruptly
from
hedge
to
hedge
and
seemingly
melted
into
nothingness
i
quitted
the
main
road
on
the
brow
of
a
low
hill
and
embarked
upon
a
wild
expanse
of
moor
lavishly
covered
with
bracken
and
white
heather
intermingled
with
which
were
the
silvery
surfaces
of
many
a
pool
of
water
for
some
seconds
i
stood
still
lost
in
contemplating
the
scenery
its
utter
abandonment
and
grand
sense
of
isolation
and
inhaling
at
the
same
time
long
and
deep
draughts
of
the
delicious
moorland
air
unmistakably
impregnated
now
with
breaths
of
ozone
my
eyes
wandering
to
the
horizon
i
detected
on
the
very
margin
of
the
moorland
a
dense
clump
of
trees
which
i
instantly
associated
with
the
spinney
in
my
old
friend
story
and
determining
that
the
renowned
spinney
should
be
my
goal
i
at
once
aimed
for
it
vigorously
striking
out
along
the
path
which
i
thought
would
be
most
likely
to
lead
to
it
half
an
hour
brisk
walking
brought
me
to
my
destination
and
i
found
myself
standing
opposite
a
granite
wall
which
my
imagination
had
no
difficulty
in
identifying
with
the
wall
so
well
described
by
porter
removing
the
briars
and
gorse
prickles
which
left
little
of
my
stockings
whole
i
went
up
to
the
wall
and
measuring
it
with
my
body
found
it
was
a
good
foot
taller
than
i
this
would
mean
rather
more
climbing
than
i
had
bargained
for
but
the
pines
the
grim
silence
of
their
slender
frames
and
gently
swaying
summits
fascinated
me
they
spoke
of
possibilities
few
could
see
or
appreciate
as
i
could
possibilities
of
a
sylvan
phantasmagoria
enhanced
by
the
soft
and
mystic
radiance
of
the
moon
an
owl
hooted
and
the
rustling
of
brushwood
told
me
of
the
near
proximity
of
some
burrower
in
the
ground
high
above
this
animal
life
remoter
even
than
the
tops
of
my
beloved
trees
or
the
etched
on
the
dark
firmament
shone
multitudinous
stars
even
the
rings
round
saturn
being
plainly
discernible
from
the
milky
way
my
eyes
at
length
wandered
to
the
pines
and
a
puff
of
air
laden
with
the
odour
of
their
resin
and
decaying
brushwood
decided
me
i
took
a
few
preliminary
sips
of
whisky
stretched
my
rusty
limbs
and
placing
one
foot
in
a
jagged
crevice
of
the
wall
swarmed
painfully
up
how
slow
and
how
hazardous
was
the
process
i
scratched
my
fingers
inured
to
the
pen
but
a
stranger
to
any
rougher
substance
i
ruined
my
boots
i
split
my
trousers
at
the
knees
and
i
felt
that
my
hat
had
parted
with
its
shape
for
ever
and
yet
i
continued
the
ascent
the
end
came
all
too
suddenly
when
within
an
ace
of
victory
i
yielded
to
impulse
and
with
an
energy
the
desperate
condition
of
my
skin
and
clothes
alone
could
account
for
i
swung
up
and
the
outer
edge
of
the
wall
melted
beneath
me
my
hands
frantically
clutched
at
nothingness
a
hideous
sensation
of
falling
surged
through
my
brain
my
ears
and
eyes
filled
to
bursting
and
with
a
terrific
crash
that
seemed
to
drive
my
head
and
spine
right
through
my
stomach
i
met
the
black
uprising
earth
and
lost
consciousness
providentially
for
me
i
had
pitched
head
first
into
a
furze
bush
which
broke
the
fall
otherwise
i
must
have
met
with
serious
injury
as
it
was
when
i
recovered
my
momentary
loss
of
consciousness
i
found
that
i
had
sustained
no
worse
harm
than
a
severe
shaking
scratches
galore
and
the
utter
demolition
of
my
clothes
i
picked
myself
up
with
difficulty
and
spent
some
time
searching
for
my
hat
and
stick
which
i
at
length
discovered
lodged
of
course
where
one
would
least
have
thought
of
looking
for
them
i
then
took
close
stock
of
my
surroundings
and
found
them
even
grimmer
than
i
had
anticipated
though
the
trees
were
packed
closely
together
and
there
was
much
undergrowth
the
moonbeams
were
so
powerful
and
so
fully
concentrated
on
the
spinney
that
i
could
see
no
inconsiderable
distance
ahead
of
me
over
everything
hung
a
solemn
and
preternatural
hush
i
saw
shadows
everywhere
shadows
that
defied
analysis
and
had
no
material
counterparts
a
sudden
crashing
of
brushwood
brought
me
to
a
standstill
and
sent
the
blood
in
columns
to
my
heart
then
i
laughed
loudly
it
was
only
a
hare
the
prettiest
and
pertest
thing
imaginable
i
went
on
something
whizzed
past
my
face
i
drew
back
in
horror
it
was
a
bat
merely
a
bat
my
nerves
were
out
of
order
the
fall
had
unsteadied
them
i
must
pull
myself
together
i
did
so
and
continued
to
advance
a
shadow
long
narrow
and
grotesque
fell
across
my
path
and
sent
a
thousand
and
one
icy
shivers
down
my
back
in
an
agony
of
terror
i
shut
my
eyes
and
plunged
madly
on
something
struck
me
in
the
face
and
hurled
me
back
my
eyes
opened
involuntarily
and
i
saw
a
tree
that
either
out
of
pique
or
sheer
obstinacy
had
planted
itself
across
the
path
i
examined
its
branches
to
make
sure
they
branches
and
continued
my
march
a
score
more
paces
a
sudden
bend
and
i
was
in
an
open
space
brilliantly
illuminated
by
moonbeams
and
peopled
with
countless
moving
shadows
one
would
have
to
go
far
to
find
a
wilder
weirder
and
more
grimly
suggestive
spot
as
i
stood
gazing
at
the
scene
in
awestruck
wonder
a
slight
breeze
rocked
the
tops
of
the
pine
trees
and
moaning
through
their
long
and
gloomy
aisles
reverberated
like
thunder
the
sounds
suggesting
slightly
ever
so
slightly
a
tattoo
brought
with
them
vivid
pictures
of
the
drummer
too
vivid
just
then
to
be
pleasant
and
i
turned
to
go
to
my
unmitigated
horror
a
white
and
lurid
object
barred
my
way
my
heart
ceased
to
beat
my
blood
turned
to
ice
i
was
sick
absolutely
sick
with
terror
besides
this
the
figure
held
me
spellbound
i
could
neither
move
nor
utter
a
sound
it
had
a
white
absolutely
white
face
a
tall
thin
perpendicular
frame
and
a
small
glittering
rotund
head
for
some
seconds
it
remained
stationary
and
then
with
a
gliding
motion
left
the
path
and
vanished
in
the
shadows
again
a
breeze
rustled
through
the
tops
of
the
pine
trees
moaned
through
their
long
and
gloomy
aisles
and
reverberated
like
thunder
tat
tat
and
with
this
sound
beating
in
my
ears
reaction
set
in
and
i
never
ceased
running
till
i
had
reached
my
hotel
case
ix
the
room
beyond
an
account
of
the
hauntings
at
hennersley
near
ayr
to
me
hennersley
is
what
the
transformation
scene
at
a
pantomime
was
to
the
imaginative
child
the
dreamy
child
of
long
ago
a
floral
paradise
full
of
the
most
delightful
surprises
here
at
hennersley
from
out
the
quite
recently
earth
softened
and
moistened
now
by
spring
rain
there
rises
up
row
upon
row
of
snowdrops
hyacinths
and
lilies
of
such
surpassing
sweetness
and
beauty
that
i
hold
my
breath
in
astonishment
and
ecstatically
chant
a
te
deum
to
the
fairies
for
sending
such
loveliness
and
then
then
ere
my
wonder
has
had
time
to
fade
it
is
summer
the
ground
opens
and
there
springs
up
on
all
sides
a
veritable
sea
of
vivid
variegated
colour
scarlet
pink
and
white
geraniums
red
white
and
yellow
roses
golden
honeysuckle
marigolds
purple
pansies
pale
wallflowers
sweet
peas
azaleas
showy
hydrangeas
giant
rhododendrons
foxgloves
buttercups
daisies
hollyhocks
and
heliotropes
a
floral
host
too
varied
to
enumerate
overcome
with
admiration
bewildered
with
happiness
i
kneel
on
the
soft
carpet
of
grass
and
burying
my
face
extravagantly
in
alternate
laps
of
luxurious
downy
petals
fill
my
lungs
with
nectar
my
intoxication
has
barely
worn
off
before
my
eyes
are
dimly
conscious
that
the
soil
all
around
me
is
generously
besprinkled
with
the
remains
of
my
floral
friends
i
spring
hurriedly
to
my
feet
and
gazing
anxiously
about
me
suddenly
perceive
the
gaily
nodding
heads
of
new
arrivals
dahlias
sunflowers
anemones
chrysanthemums
as
i
continue
gazing
the
aromatic
odour
of
mellow
apples
from
the
hennersley
orchards
reaches
my
nostrils
i
turn
round
and
there
there
in
front
of
me
i
see
row
upon
row
of
fruit
trees
their
leaves
a
brilliant
copper
in
the
scintillating
rays
of
the
ruddy
autumn
sun
i
gasp
for
breath
the
beauty
of
tint
and
tone
surpasses
all
that
i
have
hitherto
seen
it
is
sublime
the
grand
climax
of
transformation
as
the
curtain
falls
with
the
approach
of
winter
i
hurry
to
my
edinburgh
home
and
pray
for
the
prompt
return
of
early
spring
for
many
years
my
aged
relatives
the
misses
amelia
and
deborah
harbordeens
lived
at
hennersley
rarest
and
kindest
of
old
ladies
they
were
the
human
prototypes
of
the
flowers
both
they
and
i
loved
miss
amelia
with
her
beautiful
complexion
rounded
form
and
regal
mien
suggested
to
my
childish
mind
more
much
more
than
the
mere
semblance
of
a
rose
whilst
miss
deborah
with
her
sprightly
grace
and
golden
hair
was
only
masquerading
as
a
woman
she
was
in
reality
a
daffodil
unlike
so
many
of
the
fair
sex
who
go
in
for
gardening
my
aunts
were
essentially
dainty
their
figures
were
shapely
and
elegant
their
hands
slim
and
soft
i
never
saw
them
working
without
gloves
and
i
have
good
reason
to
believe
they
anointed
their
fingers
every
night
with
a
special
preparation
to
keep
them
smooth
and
white
they
were
not
decidedly
not
brainy
neither
were
they
accomplished
never
having
made
any
special
study
of
the
higher
arts
but
they
evinced
nevertheless
the
keenest
appreciation
of
painting
music
and
literature
their
library
a
large
one
boasted
a
delightful
harbourage
of
such
writers
as
jane
austen
miss
mitford
and
maria
edgeworth
and
in
their
on
the
walls
of
which
art
was
represented
by
the
old
as
well
as
modern
masters
might
be
seen
and
sometimes
heard
for
the
misses
harbordeens
often
entertained
a
broadwood
and
a
bucksen
harpsichord
i
will
describe
this
abode
not
as
i
first
saw
it
for
when
i
first
visited
my
aunts
amelia
and
deborah
i
was
only
one
year
old
but
as
i
first
remember
it
a
house
with
the
glamour
of
a
roof
and
diamond
the
house
stood
by
the
side
of
the
turnpike
road
that
broad
white
interminable
road
originating
from
goodness
knows
where
in
the
north
and
passing
through
ayr
the
nearest
town
of
any
importance
to
goodness
knows
where
in
the
south
a
shady
avenue
entered
by
a
wooden
swing
gate
bearing
the
superscription
hennersley
in
neat
white
letters
led
by
a
circuitous
route
to
it
and
not
a
vestige
of
it
could
be
seen
from
the
road
in
front
of
it
stretched
a
spacious
lawn
flanked
on
either
side
and
at
the
farthest
extremity
by
a
thick
growth
of
chestnuts
beeches
poplars
and
evergreens
the
house
itself
was
curiously
built
it
consisted
of
two
storeys
and
formed
a
main
building
and
one
wing
which
gave
it
a
peculiarly
appearance
that
reminded
me
somewhat
ludicrously
of
chanticleer
with
a
solitary
scant
and
clipped
appendage
it
was
often
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
ask
my
relatives
the
reason
of
this
singular
disparity
whether
it
was
the
result
of
a
mere
whim
on
the
part
of
the
architect
or
whether
it
had
been
caused
by
some
catastrophe
but
my
curiosity
was
always
held
in
check
by
a
strange
feeling
that
my
relatives
would
not
like
to
be
approached
on
the
subject
my
aunts
amelia
and
deborah
belonged
to
that
class
of
people
unhappily
rare
who
possess
a
power
of
generating
in
others
an
instinctive
knowledge
of
dangerous
ground
a
power
which
enabled
them
to
avert
both
from
themselves
and
the
offender
many
a
painful
situation
to
proceed
the
nakedness
of
the
walls
of
hennersley
was
veiled
who
shall
say
it
was
not
designedly
veiled
by
a
thick
covering
of
clematis
and
ivy
and
in
the
latter
innumerable
specimens
of
the
feathered
tribe
found
a
sure
and
safe
retreat
on
entering
the
house
one
stepped
at
once
into
a
large
hall
a
gallery
ran
round
it
and
from
the
centre
rose
a
broad
oak
staircase
the
rooms
with
one
or
two
exceptions
opened
into
one
another
and
were
large
and
low
and
long
in
shape
the
walls
and
floors
were
of
oak
and
the
ceilings
were
crossed
by
ponderous
oak
beams
the
fireplaces
too
were
of
the
oldest
fashion
and
in
their
comfortable
my
aunts
in
the
winter
loved
to
read
or
knit
when
the
warm
weather
came
they
made
similar
use
of
the
over
which
they
indulgently
permitted
me
to
scramble
on
to
the
lawn
the
sunlight
was
a
special
feature
of
hennersley
forcing
its
way
through
the
trellised
panes
it
illuminated
the
house
with
a
radiancy
a
soft
golden
radiancy
i
have
never
seen
elsewhere
my
relatives
seemed
to
possess
some
phenomenal
attraction
for
the
sunlight
for
no
matter
where
they
sat
a
beam
brighter
than
the
rest
always
shone
on
them
and
when
they
got
up
i
noticed
that
it
always
followed
them
accompanying
them
from
room
to
room
and
along
the
corridors
but
this
was
only
one
of
the
many
pleasant
mysteries
that
added
to
the
joy
of
my
visits
to
hennersley
i
felt
sure
that
the
house
was
enchanted
that
it
was
under
the
control
of
some
benevolent
being
who
took
a
kindly
interest
in
the
welfare
of
my
relatives
i
remember
once
on
the
occasion
of
my
customary
to
miss
amelia
who
invariably
breakfasted
in
bed
i
inhaled
the
most
delicious
odour
of
heliotrope
it
was
wafted
towards
me
in
a
cool
current
of
air
as
i
approached
her
bed
and
seemed
to
my
childish
fancy
to
be
the
friendly
greeting
of
a
sparkling
sunbeam
that
rested
on
miss
amelia
pillow
i
was
so
charmed
with
the
scent
that
alas
forgetful
of
my
manners
i
gave
a
loud
sniff
and
with
a
rapturous
smile
ejaculated
oh
auntie
cherry
pie
miss
amelia
started
dear
me
child
she
exclaimed
how
quietly
you
entered
i
had
no
idea
you
were
in
the
room
heliotrope
is
the
name
of
the
scent
my
dear
but
please
do
not
allude
to
it
again
your
aunt
deborah
and
i
are
very
fond
of
it
here
she
sighed
but
for
certain
reasons
reasons
you
would
not
understand
we
do
not
like
to
hear
the
word
heliotrope
mentioned
kiss
me
dear
and
run
away
to
your
breakfast
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
perhaps
i
was
greatly
puzzled
i
could
not
see
why
i
should
be
forbidden
to
refer
to
such
a
pleasant
and
harmless
subject
a
subject
that
looked
at
from
no
matter
what
point
of
view
did
not
appear
to
me
to
be
in
the
slightest
degree
indelicate
the
more
i
thought
over
it
the
more
convinced
i
became
that
there
was
some
association
between
the
scent
and
the
sunbeam
and
in
that
association
i
felt
sure
much
of
the
mystery
lay
the
house
was
haunted
agreeably
delightfully
haunted
by
a
golden
light
a
perfumed
radiant
light
that
could
only
have
in
my
mind
one
origin
one
creator
titania
titania
queen
of
the
fairies
the
guardian
angel
of
my
aged
my
extremely
aged
relatives
aunt
deborah
i
said
one
morning
as
i
found
her
seated
in
the
embrasure
of
the
breakfast
room
window
crocheting
aunt
deborah
you
love
the
sunlight
do
you
not
she
turned
on
me
a
startled
face
what
makes
you
ask
such
strange
questions
child
she
said
of
course
i
like
the
sun
most
people
do
it
is
no
uncommon
thing
especially
at
my
age
but
the
sunbeams
do
not
follow
every
one
auntie
do
they
i
persisted
miss
deborah
crochet
fell
into
her
lap
how
queerly
you
talk
she
said
with
a
curious
trembling
of
her
lips
how
can
the
sunbeams
follow
one
but
they
do
auntie
they
do
indeed
i
cried
i
have
often
watched
a
bright
beam
of
golden
light
follow
aunt
amelia
and
you
in
different
parts
of
the
room
and
it
has
settled
on
your
lace
collar
now
miss
deborah
looked
at
me
very
seriously
but
the
moistening
of
her
eyes
i
attributed
to
the
strong
light
esther
she
said
laying
one
of
her
soft
hands
on
my
forehead
there
are
things
god
does
not
want
little
girls
to
understand
question
me
no
more
i
obeyed
but
henceforth
i
felt
more
than
ever
assured
that
my
aunts
consciously
or
unconsciously
shared
their
charming
abode
with
some
capricious
genii
of
whose
presence
in
their
midst
i
had
become
accidentally
aware
and
to
find
out
the
enchanted
neighbourhood
of
its
mysterious
retreat
was
to
me
now
a
matter
of
importance
i
spent
hour
after
hour
roaming
through
the
corridors
the
copses
and
my
beloved
flower
gardens
in
eager
search
of
some
spot
i
could
unhesitatingly
affirm
was
the
home
of
the
genii
most
ardently
i
then
hoped
that
the
sunbeams
would
follow
me
and
that
the
breeze
charged
with
cool
heliotrope
would
greet
me
as
it
did
aunt
deborah
in
the
daytime
all
hennersley
was
sunshine
and
flowers
and
stray
where
i
would
i
never
felt
lonely
or
afraid
but
as
the
light
waned
i
saw
and
felt
a
subtle
change
creep
over
everything
the
long
aisles
of
trees
that
in
the
morning
only
struck
me
as
enchantingly
peaceful
and
shady
gradually
filled
with
strangely
terrifying
shadows
the
hue
of
the
broad
swards
deepened
into
a
darkness
i
did
not
dare
interpret
whilst
in
the
house
in
its
every
passage
nook
and
corner
a
gloom
arose
that
seeming
to
come
from
the
very
bowels
of
the
earth
brought
with
it
every
possible
suggestion
of
bogey
i
never
spoke
of
these
things
to
my
relatives
partly
because
i
was
ashamed
of
my
cowardice
and
partly
because
i
dreaded
a
fresh
rebuke
how
i
suffered
and
how
i
ridiculed
my
sufferings
in
the
mornings
when
every
trace
of
darkness
was
obliterated
and
amid
the
radiant
bloom
of
the
trees
i
thought
only
of
heliotrope
and
sunbeams
one
afternoon
my
search
for
the
abode
of
the
genii
led
me
to
the
wingless
side
of
the
house
a
side
i
rarely
visited
at
the
foot
of
the
walls
and
straight
in
their
centre
was
laid
a
wide
bed
of
flowers
every
one
of
which
was
white
but
why
white
again
and
again
i
asked
myself
this
question
but
i
dared
not
broach
it
to
my
relatives
a
garden
all
white
was
assuredly
an
enigma
and
to
every
enigma
there
is
undoubtedly
a
key
was
this
garden
which
was
all
white
in
any
way
connected
with
the
sunbeams
and
heliotrope
was
it
another
of
the
mysteries
god
concealed
from
little
girls
could
this
be
the
home
of
the
genii
this
latter
idea
had
no
sooner
entered
my
head
than
it
became
a
conviction
of
course
there
was
no
doubt
whatever
it
was
the
home
of
the
genii
the
white
petals
were
now
a
source
of
peculiar
interest
to
me
i
was
fascinated
the
minutes
sped
by
and
still
i
was
there
it
was
not
until
the
sun
had
disappeared
in
the
horizon
and
the
grim
shadows
of
twilight
were
creeping
out
upon
me
from
the
neighbouring
trees
and
bushes
that
i
awoke
from
my
reverie
and
fled
that
night
unable
to
sleep
through
the
excitement
caused
by
my
discovery
of
the
home
of
the
genii
i
lay
awake
my
whole
thoughts
concentrated
in
one
desire
the
passionate
desire
to
see
the
fairy
of
hennersley
i
had
never
heard
of
ghosts
and
hear
its
story
my
bedroom
was
down
the
corridor
leading
from
the
head
of
the
main
staircase
to
the
extremity
of
the
wing
after
i
said
i
did
not
see
my
aunts
again
till
the
morning
they
never
by
any
chance
visited
me
after
i
was
in
bed
hence
i
knew
when
i
had
retired
for
the
night
i
should
not
see
a
human
face
nor
hear
a
human
voice
for
nearly
twelve
hours
this
when
i
thought
of
the
genii
with
its
golden
beams
of
light
and
scent
of
heliotrope
did
not
trouble
me
it
was
only
when
my
thoughts
would
not
run
in
this
channel
that
i
felt
any
fear
and
that
fear
was
not
of
the
darkness
itself
but
of
what
the
darkness
suggested
on
this
particular
night
for
the
first
few
hours
i
was
sublimely
happy
and
then
a
strange
restlessness
seized
me
i
was
obsessed
with
a
wish
to
see
the
for
some
minutes
stimulated
by
a
dread
of
what
my
aunts
would
think
of
such
a
violation
of
conventionality
on
the
part
of
a
child
i
combated
furiously
with
the
desire
but
at
length
the
longing
was
so
great
so
utterly
and
wholly
irresistible
that
i
succumbed
and
getting
quietly
out
of
bed
made
my
way
noiselessly
into
the
corridor
all
was
dark
and
still
stiller
than
i
had
ever
known
it
before
without
any
hesitation
i
plunged
forward
in
the
direction
of
the
wingless
side
of
the
house
where
there
was
a
long
narrow
stained
window
that
commanded
an
immediate
prospect
of
the
white
garden
i
had
seldom
looked
out
of
it
as
up
to
the
present
this
side
of
the
house
had
little
attraction
for
me
but
all
was
changed
now
and
as
i
felt
my
way
cautiously
along
the
corridor
a
thousand
and
one
fanciful
notions
of
what
i
might
see
surged
through
my
brain
i
came
to
the
end
of
the
corridor
i
descended
half
a
dozen
stairs
i
got
to
the
middle
of
the
gallery
overlooking
the
large
entrance
hall
below
me
above
me
on
all
sides
of
me
was
stygian
darkness
i
stopped
and
there
suddenly
rang
out
apparently
from
close
at
hand
a
loud
clear
most
appallingly
clear
cry
which
beginning
in
a
low
key
ended
in
a
shriek
so
horrid
harsh
and
piercing
that
i
felt
my
heart
shrivel
up
within
me
and
in
sheer
desperation
i
buried
my
fingers
in
my
ears
to
deaden
the
sound
i
was
now
too
frightened
to
move
one
way
or
the
other
all
the
strength
departed
from
my
limbs
and
when
i
endeavoured
to
move
my
feet
i
could
not
they
appeared
to
be
fastened
to
the
ground
with
lead
weights
i
felt
i
intuitively
felt
that
the
author
of
the
disturbance
was
regarding
my
terror
with
grim
satisfaction
and
that
it
was
merely
postponing
further
action
in
order
to
enjoy
my
suspense
to
block
out
the
sight
of
this
dreadful
creature
i
clenched
my
eyelids
tightly
together
at
the
same
time
earnestly
imploring
god
to
help
me
suddenly
i
heard
the
low
wail
begin
again
and
then
the
echo
of
a
silvery
voice
came
softly
to
me
through
the
gloom
it
an
owl
only
an
owl
with
rapidity
the
truth
then
dawned
on
me
and
as
i
withdrew
my
clammy
from
my
ears
the
faint
fluttering
of
wings
reached
me
through
an
open
skylight
once
again
i
moved
on
the
gallery
was
left
behind
and
i
was
well
on
my
way
down
the
tortuous
passage
leading
to
my
goal
when
a
luminous
object
of
vast
height
and
cylindrical
shape
suddenly
barred
my
progress
overcome
by
a
deadly
sickness
i
sank
on
the
floor
and
burying
my
face
in
my
hands
quite
made
up
my
mind
that
my
last
moments
had
come
how
long
i
remained
in
this
position
i
can
not
say
to
me
it
seemed
eternity
i
was
eventually
freed
from
it
by
the
echo
of
a
gentle
laugh
so
kind
and
gay
and
girlish
that
my
terror
at
once
departed
and
on
raising
my
head
i
perceived
that
the
cause
of
my
panic
was
nothing
more
than
a
broad
beam
of
moonlight
on
a
particularly
prominent
angle
of
the
wall
heartily
ashamed
at
my
cowardice
i
got
up
and
stepping
briskly
forward
soon
reached
the
window
pressing
my
face
against
the
pane
i
peered
through
it
and
there
immediately
beneath
me
lay
the
flowers
glorified
into
dazzling
gold
by
the
yellow
colour
of
the
glass
the
sight
thrilled
me
with
joy
it
was
sublime
my
instinct
had
not
deceived
me
this
was
indeed
the
home
of
the
genii
the
temperature
which
had
been
high
abnormally
so
for
june
now
underwent
an
abrupt
change
and
a
chill
current
of
air
sweeping
down
on
me
from
the
rear
made
my
teeth
chatter
i
involuntarily
shrank
back
from
the
window
and
as
i
did
so
to
my
utter
astonishment
it
disappeared
and
i
saw
in
its
place
a
room
it
was
a
long
low
room
and
opposite
to
me
at
the
farthest
extremity
was
a
large
bay
window
through
which
i
could
see
the
nodding
tops
of
the
trees
the
furniture
was
all
green
and
of
a
lighter
daintier
make
than
any
i
had
hitherto
seen
the
walls
were
covered
with
pictures
the
mantelshelf
with
flowers
whilst
i
was
busily
employed
noting
all
these
details
the
door
of
the
room
opened
and
the
threshold
was
gorgeously
illuminated
by
a
brilliant
sunbeam
from
which
suddenly
evolved
the
figure
of
a
young
and
lovely
girl
i
can
see
her
now
as
i
saw
her
then
tall
and
slender
with
masses
of
golden
hair
waved
artistically
aside
from
a
low
forehead
of
snowy
white
brows
and
long
eyes
of
the
most
lustrous
violet
a
straight
nose
a
firm
chin
and
a
bewitching
mouth
at
her
bosom
was
a
bunch
of
heliotrope
which
deftly
undoing
she
raised
to
her
nose
and
then
laughingly
held
out
to
me
i
was
charmed
i
took
a
step
forward
towards
her
the
instant
i
did
so
a
wild
look
of
terror
distorted
her
face
she
waved
me
back
something
jarred
against
my
knee
and
in
the
place
of
the
room
i
saw
only
the
blurred
outline
of
trees
through
the
yellow
bitterly
disappointed
but
absolutely
sure
that
what
i
had
seen
was
objective
i
retraced
my
steps
to
my
bedroom
and
passed
the
remainder
of
the
night
in
sound
sleep
after
breakfast
however
unable
to
restrain
my
curiosity
longer
i
sought
miss
amelia
who
was
easier
to
approach
than
her
sister
and
managing
after
several
efforts
to
screw
up
courage
blurted
out
the
story
of
my
nocturnal
escapade
my
aunt
listened
in
silence
she
was
always
gentle
but
on
this
occasion
she
surpassed
herself
i
am
not
going
to
scold
you
esther
she
said
smoothing
out
my
curls
after
what
you
have
seen
it
is
useless
to
conceal
the
truth
from
you
god
perhaps
intends
you
to
know
all
years
ago
esther
this
house
was
not
as
you
see
it
now
it
had
two
wings
and
in
the
one
that
no
longer
exists
was
the
bedroom
you
saw
in
your
vision
we
called
it
the
green
room
because
everything
in
it
was
green
your
aunt
alicia
an
aunt
you
have
never
heard
of
who
slept
there
having
a
peculiar
fancy
for
that
colour
alicia
was
our
youngest
sister
and
we
all
loved
her
dearly
she
was
just
as
you
describe
her
beautiful
as
a
fairy
with
golden
hair
and
violet
eyes
and
she
always
wore
a
bunch
of
heliotrope
in
her
dress
one
night
esther
one
lovely
calm
midsummer
night
forty
years
ago
this
house
was
broken
into
by
burglars
they
got
in
through
the
green
room
window
which
was
always
left
open
during
the
warm
weather
we
my
mother
your
aunt
deborah
and
i
were
awakened
by
a
loud
shriek
for
help
recognising
alicia
voice
we
instantly
flew
out
of
bed
and
summoning
the
servants
tore
to
the
green
room
as
fast
as
we
could
to
our
horror
esther
the
door
was
locked
and
before
we
could
break
the
lock
the
ruffians
had
murdered
her
they
escaped
through
the
window
and
were
never
caught
my
mother
your
had
that
part
of
the
house
pulled
down
and
on
the
site
of
it
she
planted
the
white
garden
though
alicia
earthly
body
died
and
was
taken
from
us
her
beautiful
spirit
remains
with
us
here
it
follows
us
about
in
the
daytime
in
the
form
of
a
sunbeam
whilst
occasionally
at
night
it
assumes
her
earthly
shape
the
house
is
what
is
generally
termed
haunted
and
no
doubt
some
people
would
be
afraid
to
live
in
it
but
that
esther
is
because
they
do
not
understand
spirits
your
aunt
deborah
and
i
do
do
you
think
auntie
i
asked
with
a
thrill
of
joy
do
you
think
it
at
all
likely
that
i
shall
see
aunt
alicia
again
aunt
amelia
shook
her
head
gently
no
my
dear
she
said
slowly
i
think
it
will
be
impossible
because
you
are
going
home
this
afternoon
case
x
house
near
blythswood
square
glasgow
the
haunted
bath
when
captain
de
smythe
went
to
look
over
house
in
the
neighbourhood
of
blythswood
square
glasgow
the
only
thing
about
the
house
he
did
not
like
was
the
bathroom
it
struck
him
as
excessively
grim
the
secret
of
the
grimness
did
not
lie
he
thought
in
any
one
particular
feature
in
the
tall
gaunt
geyser
for
example
though
there
was
always
something
in
the
look
of
a
geyser
when
it
was
old
and
dilapidated
as
was
the
case
with
this
one
that
repelled
him
or
in
the
dark
or
in
the
narrow
window
but
in
the
room
as
a
whole
in
its
atmosphere
and
general
appearance
he
could
not
diagnose
it
he
could
not
associate
it
with
anything
else
he
had
ever
experienced
it
was
a
grimness
that
he
could
only
specify
as
grim
grim
with
a
grimness
that
made
him
feel
he
should
not
like
to
be
alone
there
in
the
dead
of
night
it
was
a
nuisance
because
the
rest
of
the
house
pleased
him
moreover
the
locality
was
convenient
and
the
rent
moderate
very
moderate
for
such
a
neighbourhood
he
thought
the
matter
well
over
as
he
leaned
in
the
doorway
of
the
bathroom
he
could
of
course
have
the
room
completely
renovated
new
paper
new
paint
and
a
fresh
bath
pipes
the
geyser
should
be
done
away
with
geysers
were
hideous
dangerous
and
pshaw
what
nonsense
ghostly
ghostly
what
absurd
rot
how
his
wife
would
laugh
that
decided
the
question
his
wife
she
had
expressed
a
very
ardent
wish
that
he
should
take
a
house
in
or
near
blythswood
square
if
he
could
get
one
on
anything
like
reasonable
terms
and
here
was
his
chance
he
would
accompany
the
agent
of
the
property
to
the
latter
office
and
the
preliminaries
should
be
forthwith
settled
six
weeks
later
he
and
his
family
were
installed
in
the
house
which
still
reeked
with
the
smell
of
fresh
paint
and
paper
the
first
thing
the
captain
did
when
he
got
there
was
to
steal
away
slyly
to
the
bathroom
and
as
soon
as
he
opened
the
door
his
heart
sank
despite
the
many
alterations
the
room
had
undergone
the
grimness
was
still
there
there
everywhere
in
the
fine
new
bath
with
its
glistening
gleaming
wooden
framework
in
the
newly
papered
newly
painted
cupboard
in
the
walls
with
their
bright
fresh
paper
in
the
snowy
surface
of
the
whitewashed
ceiling
in
the
air
the
very
air
itself
was
full
of
it
the
captain
was
as
a
rule
very
fond
of
his
bath
but
in
his
new
quarters
he
firmly
resolved
that
some
one
else
should
use
the
bath
before
he
made
the
experiment
in
a
very
few
days
the
family
had
all
settled
down
and
every
one
with
the
exception
of
the
captain
had
had
a
bath
but
no
matter
how
many
and
how
bitter
were
his
wife
complaints
try
how
he
would
he
could
not
he
positively
not
bring
himself
to
wash
in
the
bathroom
it
was
all
right
so
long
as
the
door
was
open
but
his
wife
resolutely
refused
to
allow
him
to
keep
it
open
and
the
moment
it
was
shut
his
abject
terror
returned
a
terror
produced
by
nothing
that
he
could
in
any
way
analyse
or
define
at
last
ashamed
of
his
cowardice
he
screwed
up
courage
and
with
a
look
of
determined
desperation
in
his
eyes
and
mouth
an
expression
which
sent
his
wife
into
fits
of
laughter
set
out
one
night
from
his
bedroom
candle
in
hand
and
entered
the
bathroom
shutting
and
locking
the
door
he
lighted
another
candle
and
after
placing
them
both
on
the
mantelshelf
turned
on
the
bath
water
and
began
to
undress
i
may
as
well
have
a
peep
in
the
cupboard
he
said
just
to
satisfy
myself
no
one
is
hiding
there
for
every
one
in
the
house
knows
how
i
hate
this
beastly
bathroom
with
the
intention
of
playing
me
a
practical
joke
supposing
one
of
the
maids
polly
for
example
sure
she
be
quite
capable
took
it
into
her
pretty
head
to
but
here
the
captain
was
obliged
to
stop
he
really
was
not
equal
to
facing
even
in
his
mind
eye
the
situation
such
a
supposition
involved
and
at
the
bare
idea
of
such
a
thing
his
countenance
assumed
a
deeper
hue
and
i
am
loth
to
admit
an
amused
grin
the
grin
however
died
out
as
he
cautiously
opened
the
door
and
peered
furtively
in
no
one
nothing
was
there
with
a
breath
of
relief
he
closed
the
door
again
placed
a
chair
against
it
and
sitting
down
proceeded
to
pull
off
his
clothes
coat
vest
he
placed
them
all
tenderly
in
an
untidy
heap
on
the
floor
and
then
with
a
last
lingering
affectionate
look
at
them
walked
sedately
towards
the
bath
but
this
sedateness
was
only
momentary
the
first
few
steps
he
walked
but
a
noise
in
the
grate
startling
him
he
suddenly
assumed
an
air
of
the
greatest
gaiety
and
bowing
with
mock
gallantry
to
his
trousers
he
now
waltzed
coquettishly
to
the
bath
it
was
grim
horribly
grim
and
horribly
hot
too
for
when
he
felt
the
temperature
with
one
of
his
squat
podgy
toes
it
made
him
swear
quite
involuntarily
turning
on
the
cold
water
and
slapping
his
thighs
playfully
he
felt
again
too
hot
yet
far
too
hot
even
for
him
he
loved
heat
more
cold
and
he
was
hoisting
one
chubby
leg
to
feel
again
when
a
repetition
of
the
noise
in
the
grate
making
him
swing
round
he
lost
his
balance
and
descended
on
the
floor
with
a
hard
a
very
hard
bump
for
some
seconds
he
lay
still
too
sulky
and
aggrieved
even
to
get
up
but
the
draught
from
under
the
door
tickling
his
bare
flesh
in
the
most
immodest
fashion
he
roused
himself
from
this
lethargy
and
was
about
to
raise
himself
from
the
floor
when
the
lights
went
out
went
out
without
a
moment
warning
and
he
found
himself
engulfed
in
the
most
funereal
darkness
to
say
he
was
startled
is
to
put
it
very
mildly
he
was
absolutely
far
too
to
think
of
moving
now
and
least
of
all
of
getting
up
and
groping
for
the
matches
indeed
when
he
came
to
think
of
it
he
had
not
seen
any
matches
in
the
room
and
he
had
not
brought
any
with
him
his
wife
had
flurried
him
so
much
the
moment
the
candles
were
extinguished
the
grimness
sensibly
increased
and
he
could
feel
all
around
him
thickly
amalgamated
with
the
ether
a
superphysical
presence
at
once
hostile
and
horrible
then
to
bring
his
terror
to
a
climax
there
issued
from
the
bath
a
loud
rubbing
and
splashing
as
if
some
one
some
very
heavy
person
was
vigorously
washing
the
water
rose
and
fell
squished
and
bubbled
as
it
does
when
one
is
lying
at
full
length
in
it
raising
and
lowering
oneself
kicking
and
plunging
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
whilst
to
add
to
the
realism
captain
smythe
distinctly
heard
gasping
and
puffing
and
the
soft
greasy
sound
of
a
flannel
he
could
indeed
follow
every
movement
of
the
occupant
of
the
bath
as
graphically
as
if
he
had
seen
him
from
the
brisk
scrubbing
of
body
and
legs
to
the
finicky
process
of
cleaning
the
ears
and
toes
it
was
whilst
the
bather
was
occupied
thus
that
the
cupboard
door
began
to
open
very
quietly
and
stealthily
and
captain
de
smythe
heard
the
chair
he
had
so
carefully
placed
against
it
being
gradually
propelled
across
the
floor
then
something
he
would
have
given
anything
to
tell
what
came
out
and
began
to
steal
towards
him
he
tried
to
crawl
out
of
its
way
but
could
not
his
limbs
no
longer
acted
conjointly
with
his
brain
and
when
he
opened
his
mouth
to
shout
at
it
his
voice
withered
away
in
his
throat
it
came
up
to
him
and
directly
it
touched
his
naked
skin
he
knew
it
was
a
woman
a
woman
with
a
silk
skirt
and
silk
petticoats
a
woman
whose
person
was
perfumed
with
violets
a
scent
for
which
the
captain
had
a
particular
weakness
and
without
doubt
loaded
with
jewellery
her
behaviour
did
not
betray
any
symptoms
of
embarrassment
when
she
encountered
the
captain
lying
on
the
floor
but
planting
one
shoe
on
his
chest
and
the
other
on
his
cheek
she
stepped
on
him
as
if
he
had
been
an
orthodox
cushion
or
footstool
purposely
placed
there
for
her
convenience
a
hollow
exclamation
which
died
away
in
a
gasp
issued
from
the
bath
as
the
woman
with
a
swift
movement
of
her
arms
threw
something
over
it
what
followed
the
captain
could
only
surmise
but
from
the
muttered
imprecations
and
splashes
in
the
water
it
seemed
to
him
that
nothing
short
of
murder
was
taking
place
after
a
while
the
noises
in
the
bath
grew
feebler
and
feebler
and
when
they
finally
ceased
the
woman
with
a
sigh
of
relief
shook
the
water
from
her
arms
and
stepping
off
the
captain
moved
towards
the
fireplace
the
spell
which
had
up
to
the
present
enthralled
the
unfortunate
captain
was
now
broken
and
thinking
that
his
ghostly
visitor
had
betaken
herself
right
away
he
sat
up
he
had
hardly
done
so
before
the
darkness
was
rudely
dissipated
and
to
his
horror
he
saw
looking
at
him
from
a
distance
of
only
a
few
feet
a
white
luminous
face
presumably
that
of
a
woman
but
what
a
woman
what
a
devil
what
a
match
for
the
most
lurid
of
any
of
satan
male
retainers
yet
she
was
not
without
beauty
beauty
of
the
richest
sensual
order
beauty
that
had
it
been
flesh
and
blood
would
have
sent
men
mad
her
hair
jet
black
wavy
and
parted
in
the
centre
was
looped
over
her
ears
which
were
set
unusually
low
and
far
back
on
her
head
her
nose
was
of
that
rare
and
matchless
shape
termed
grecian
and
her
mouth
in
form
a
triumph
of
all
things
heavenly
in
expression
a
triumph
of
all
things
hellish
the
magnificent
turn
of
its
short
upper
lip
and
the
soft
voluptuous
line
of
its
under
lip
its
sportive
dimples
and
ripe
red
colour
its
even
rows
of
dazzling
pearly
teeth
were
adorable
but
they
appealed
to
the
senses
and
in
no
sense
or
shape
to
the
soul
her
brows
slightly
irregular
in
outline
met
over
the
nose
her
eyelashes
were
of
great
length
and
her
eyes
slightly
ever
so
slightly
obliquely
set
and
larger
than
those
of
living
human
beings
were
black
black
as
her
hair
and
the
pupils
sparkled
and
shone
with
the
most
damnable
expression
of
satanical
hatred
and
glee
the
whole
thing
the
face
and
the
light
that
emanated
from
it
was
so
entirely
awful
and
devilish
that
captain
smythe
sat
like
one
turned
to
stone
and
it
was
not
until
long
after
it
had
vanished
that
he
groped
his
way
to
the
door
and
in
adam
costume
for
he
dared
not
stay
to
put
on
his
clothes
fled
down
the
passage
to
his
bedroom
from
his
wife
he
got
little
sympathy
her
sarcasm
was
too
deep
for
words
and
she
merely
ordered
her
husband
on
no
account
to
breathe
a
word
of
his
silliness
before
either
the
children
or
the
servants
the
injunction
however
which
was
naturally
carried
out
to
the
letter
was
futile
as
a
precaution
for
on
running
into
the
bathroom
one
morning
when
every
one
else
was
downstairs
the
eldest
boy
ronald
saw
floating
in
the
bath
the
body
of
a
old
man
it
was
bloated
and
purplish
blue
and
had
big
glassy
eyes
that
stared
at
him
in
such
a
hideous
meaningless
manner
that
he
uttered
a
scream
of
terror
and
fled
alarmed
at
the
noise
most
of
the
household
ran
to
see
what
had
happened
only
the
captain
remained
behind
he
knew
only
too
well
and
he
hid
letting
his
wife
and
the
servants
go
upstairs
alone
they
entered
the
bathroom
there
was
nothing
in
the
bath
not
even
water
but
as
they
were
leaving
they
ran
into
a
dark
handsome
woman
clad
in
the
most
costly
of
dresses
and
sparkling
with
jewellery
she
glided
past
them
with
sly
silent
footsteps
and
vanished
by
the
cupboard
cured
of
scepticism
and
throwing
dignity
to
the
wind
the
captain
wife
raced
downstairs
and
bursting
into
the
flung
herself
on
the
sofa
in
hysterics
within
a
week
the
house
was
once
again
empty
and
the
rumour
getting
about
that
it
was
haunted
the
landlord
threatened
the
smythes
with
an
action
for
slander
of
title
but
i
do
not
think
the
case
was
taken
to
court
the
smythes
agreeing
to
contradict
the
report
they
had
originated
astute
inquiries
however
eventually
led
them
to
discover
that
a
lady
answering
to
the
description
of
the
ghost
they
had
seen
had
once
lived
at
house
of
spanish
descent
she
was
young
beautiful
and
gay
and
was
married
to
a
man
an
extremely
wealthy
man
people
remembered
how
rich
he
was
after
he
died
old
enough
to
be
her
grandfather
they
had
nothing
in
common
the
husband
only
wanting
to
be
quiet
the
wife
to
flirt
and
be
admired
their
neighbours
often
heard
them
quarrel
and
it
was
declared
that
the
wife
possessed
the
temper
of
a
fiend
the
man
was
eventually
found
dead
in
his
bath
and
there
being
no
indications
of
violence
it
was
generally
supposed
that
he
had
fainted
his
wife
having
been
previously
heard
to
declare
that
he
often
had
fainting
fits
and
had
thus
been
accidentally
drowned
the
beautiful
young
widow
who
inherited
all
his
money
left
the
house
immediately
and
went
abroad
and
the
neighbours
when
questioned
by
the
smythes
as
to
whether
anything
had
been
seen
of
her
since
shook
their
heads
dubiously
but
refused
to
commit
themselves
case
xi
the
choking
ghost
of
house
near
sandyford
place
glasgow
the
last
time
i
was
passing
through
glasgow
i
put
up
for
the
night
at
an
hotel
near
sandyford
place
and
met
there
an
old
theatrical
acquaintance
named
browne
hely
browne
not
having
seen
him
since
i
gave
up
acting
which
is
now
alas
a
good
many
years
we
had
much
to
discuss
touring
days
lodgings
managers
crowds
and
a
dozen
other
subjects
all
included
in
the
vulgar
term
shop
we
spent
the
whole
of
one
evening
debating
thus
in
the
whilst
the
following
night
we
went
to
an
entertainment
given
by
that
charming
reciter
and
raconteur
miss
lilian
north
who
apart
from
her
talent
which
in
my
opinion
places
her
in
the
first
rank
of
her
profession
is
the
possessor
of
extraordinary
personal
attractions
not
the
least
remarkable
of
which
are
her
hands
indeed
it
was
through
my
attention
being
called
to
the
latter
that
i
am
indirectly
indebted
for
this
story
miss
north
has
typically
psychic
hands
exquisitely
white
and
narrow
and
her
long
tapering
fingers
and
filbert
nails
which
by
the
way
are
always
trimly
manicured
are
the
most
perfect
i
have
ever
seen
i
was
alluding
to
them
on
our
way
back
to
the
hotel
after
her
performance
when
hely
browne
interrupted
me
talking
about
psychic
things
he
said
do
you
know
there
is
a
haunted
house
near
where
we
are
staying
you
do
very
well
then
if
i
tell
you
what
i
know
and
you
write
about
it
will
you
promise
not
to
allude
to
the
house
by
its
right
number
if
you
do
there
will
be
the
dickens
to
pay
simply
call
it
house
near
sandyford
place
you
promise
good
let
us
take
a
little
stroll
before
we
turn
in
i
feel
i
want
a
breath
of
fresh
air
and
i
will
tell
you
the
experience
i
once
had
there
it
is
exactly
two
years
ago
and
i
was
on
tour
here
in
green
all
the
usual
theatrical
had
been
snapped
up
long
before
i
arrived
and
not
knowing
where
else
to
go
i
went
to
sandyford
place
which
i
saw
advertised
in
one
of
the
local
papers
as
a
private
hotel
with
very
moderate
charges
a
wild
bit
of
extravagance
eh
but
then
one
does
do
foolish
things
sometimes
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
wanted
a
change
badly
i
had
for
a
long
time
with
a
fellow
called
charlie
grosvenor
not
at
all
a
bad
chap
but
rather
apt
to
get
on
one
nerves
after
a
while
and
he
had
got
on
mine
horribly
consequently
i
was
not
at
all
sorry
for
an
excuse
to
get
away
from
him
for
a
bit
even
though
i
had
to
pay
dearly
for
it
a
private
hotel
in
a
neighbourhood
like
that
of
sandyford
place
is
a
big
order
for
an
ordinary
comedian
i
forget
exactly
what
the
terms
were
but
i
know
i
pulled
rather
a
long
face
when
i
was
told
still
being
as
i
say
tired
of
the
usual
i
determined
to
try
it
and
accordingly
found
myself
landed
in
a
bedroom
on
the
second
floor
the
first
three
nights
passed
and
nothing
happened
saving
that
i
had
the
most
diabolical
nightmares
a
very
unusual
thing
for
me
was
the
cheese
i
said
to
myself
when
i
got
out
of
bed
the
first
morning
will
take
very
good
care
i
do
touch
cheese
i
kept
this
resolution
but
i
had
the
nightmare
again
and
even
if
anything
worse
than
before
then
i
fancied
it
must
be
cocoa
i
was
at
that
time
a
teetotaller
so
i
took
hot
milk
instead
but
i
had
nightmare
all
the
same
and
my
dreams
terrified
me
to
such
an
extent
that
i
did
not
dare
get
out
of
bed
in
the
morning
it
was
then
winter
till
it
was
broad
daylight
it
was
now
becoming
a
serious
matter
with
me
as
you
know
an
actor
more
than
most
people
needs
sleep
and
it
soon
became
as
much
as
i
could
do
to
maintain
my
usual
standard
of
acting
on
the
fourth
night
determining
to
get
rest
at
all
costs
i
took
a
stiff
glass
of
hot
brandy
just
before
getting
into
bed
i
slept
i
could
scarcely
help
sleeping
but
not
for
long
for
i
was
rudely
awakened
from
my
slumbers
by
a
loud
crash
i
sat
up
in
bed
thinking
the
whole
house
was
falling
about
my
ears
the
sound
was
not
repeated
and
all
was
profoundly
silent
wondering
what
on
earth
the
noise
could
have
been
and
feeling
very
thirsty
i
got
out
of
bed
to
get
a
drink
of
to
my
annoyance
however
though
i
groped
about
everywhere
knocking
an
ash
tray
off
the
mantelpiece
and
smashing
the
lid
of
the
i
could
find
neither
the
nor
matches
at
length
giving
it
up
as
a
bad
job
i
decided
to
get
into
bed
again
with
that
end
in
view
i
groped
my
way
through
the
darkness
steering
myself
by
the
furniture
the
position
of
which
was
of
course
quite
familiar
to
me
at
least
i
imagined
it
was
judge
then
of
my
astonishment
when
i
could
not
find
the
bed
at
first
i
regarded
it
as
a
huge
joke
and
laughed
how
rich
ha
ha
ha
fancy
not
being
able
to
find
one
way
back
to
bed
in
a
room
of
this
dimension
good
enough
for
too
good
perhaps
now
ha
ha
ha
but
it
soon
grew
past
a
joke
i
had
been
round
the
room
completely
round
the
room
twice
and
still
no
bed
i
became
seriously
alarmed
could
i
be
ill
was
i
going
mad
but
no
my
forehead
was
cool
my
pulse
normal
for
some
seconds
i
stood
still
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
then
to
make
one
more
desperate
attempt
i
stuck
straight
in
front
of
me
and
ran
into
something
something
that
recoiled
and
hit
me
thrilled
with
amazement
i
put
up
my
hand
to
feel
what
it
was
and
touched
a
noose
a
noose
i
ejaculated
interrupting
hely
browne
for
the
first
time
since
he
began
yes
a
noose
he
repeated
suspended
in
as
you
can
imagine
i
was
greatly
astonished
for
i
knew
there
had
been
nothing
that
i
could
be
now
mistaking
for
a
noose
in
the
room
overnight
i
stretched
out
my
arms
to
feel
to
what
it
was
fastened
but
to
add
to
my
surprise
the
cord
terminated
in
thin
air
then
i
grew
frightened
and
dropping
my
arms
tried
to
move
away
from
the
spot
i
could
not
my
feet
were
glued
to
the
floor
with
a
gentle
purring
sound
the
noose
commenced
fawning
i
use
that
word
because
the
action
was
so
intensely
bestial
so
like
that
of
a
cat
or
snake
round
my
neck
and
face
it
then
rose
above
me
and
after
circling
furiously
round
and
round
and
creating
a
miniature
maelstrom
in
the
air
descended
gradually
over
my
head
lower
and
lower
it
stole
like
some
sleek
caressing
slug
now
past
the
tips
of
my
ears
now
my
nose
now
my
chin
until
with
a
tiny
thud
it
landed
on
my
shoulders
when
with
a
fierce
snap
it
suddenly
tightened
i
endeavoured
to
tear
it
off
but
every
time
i
raised
my
hands
a
strong
magnetic
force
drew
them
to
my
side
again
i
opened
my
mouth
to
shriek
for
help
and
an
icy
current
of
air
froze
the
breath
in
my
lungs
i
was
helpless
utterly
wholly
helpless
cold
clammy
hands
tore
my
feet
from
the
floor
i
was
hoisted
bodily
up
and
then
let
drop
a
frightful
pain
shot
through
me
a
hundred
wires
cut
into
my
throat
at
once
i
gasped
choked
suffocated
and
in
my
mad
efforts
to
find
a
foothold
kicked
out
frantically
in
all
directions
but
this
only
resulted
in
an
increase
of
my
torments
since
with
every
plunge
the
noose
grew
tauter
my
agony
at
last
grew
unbearable
i
could
feel
the
sides
of
my
raw
and
palpitating
thorax
driven
into
one
another
while
every
attempt
to
heave
up
breath
from
my
bursting
lungs
was
rewarded
with
the
most
excruciating
paroxysms
of
pain
pain
more
acute
than
i
thought
it
possible
for
any
human
being
to
endure
my
head
became
ten
times
its
natural
size
blood
foaming
boiling
blood
poured
into
it
from
god
knows
where
and
under
its
pressure
my
eyes
bulged
in
their
sockets
and
the
veins
in
my
nose
cracked
terrific
thunderings
echoed
and
in
my
ears
my
tongue
huge
as
a
mountain
shot
against
my
teeth
a
sea
of
fire
raged
through
my
brain
and
then
blackness
blackness
inconceivable
when
i
recovered
consciousness
i
found
myself
standing
cold
and
shivering
but
otherwise
sound
and
whole
on
the
chilly
oilcloth
i
had
now
no
difficulty
in
finding
my
way
back
to
bed
and
in
about
an
hour
time
succeeded
in
falling
asleep
i
slept
till
late
and
on
getting
up
tried
to
persuade
myself
that
my
horrible
experience
was
but
the
result
of
another
nightmare
as
you
may
guess
after
all
this
i
did
not
look
forward
to
bedtime
and
counted
the
minutes
as
they
flew
by
with
the
utmost
regret
never
had
i
been
so
sorry
when
my
performance
at
the
theatre
was
over
and
the
lights
of
my
hotel
once
again
hove
in
sight
i
entered
my
bedroom
in
fear
and
trembling
and
was
so
apprehensive
lest
i
should
be
again
compelled
to
undergo
the
sensations
of
hanging
that
i
decided
to
keep
a
light
burning
all
night
and
for
that
reason
had
bought
half
a
pound
of
wax
candles
at
last
i
grew
so
sleepy
that
i
could
keep
awake
no
longer
and
placing
the
candlestick
on
a
chair
by
the
bed
i
scrambled
in
between
the
sheets
without
as
much
as
a
sip
of
spirits
i
slept
like
a
top
when
i
awoke
the
room
was
in
pitch
darkness
a
curious
smell
at
once
attracted
my
notice
i
thought
at
first
it
might
be
but
the
passing
illusion
of
a
dream
but
no
i
sniffed
again
it
was
there
there
close
to
me
under
my
very
nose
the
strong
pungent
odour
of
drugs
but
not
being
a
professor
of
smells
nor
even
a
humble
student
of
physics
i
was
consequently
unable
to
diagnose
it
and
could
only
arrive
at
the
general
conclusion
that
it
was
a
smell
that
brought
with
it
very
vivid
recollections
of
a
chemist
shop
and
of
my
old
school
laboratory
wondering
whence
it
originated
i
thrust
my
face
forward
with
the
intention
of
trying
to
locate
it
when
to
my
horror
my
lips
touched
against
something
cold
and
flabby
in
an
agony
of
fear
i
reeled
away
from
it
and
the
bed
being
narrow
i
slipped
over
the
edge
and
bumped
on
to
the
floor
now
i
think
it
is
quite
possible
that
up
to
this
point
you
may
have
attributed
my
unhappy
experience
to
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
bad
dream
but
your
dream
theory
can
no
longer
hold
good
for
on
coming
in
such
sudden
contact
with
the
floor
i
gave
my
a
knock
which
i
can
assure
you
made
me
thoroughly
awake
and
the
first
thing
i
noticed
on
recovering
my
scattered
senses
was
the
smell
i
sat
up
and
saw
to
my
terror
my
bed
was
occupied
but
occupied
in
the
most
alarming
manner
on
the
middle
of
the
pillow
was
a
face
the
face
of
i
looked
closer
i
would
have
given
every
penny
i
possessed
not
to
have
done
so
but
i
could
not
help
myself
i
looked
closer
and
it
was
the
face
of
my
brother
my
brother
ralph
you
may
recollect
my
mentioning
him
to
you
for
he
was
the
only
one
of
us
who
was
at
that
time
making
money
whom
i
believed
to
be
in
new
york
he
had
always
been
rather
sallow
but
apart
from
the
fact
that
he
now
looked
very
yellow
his
appearance
was
quite
natural
indeed
as
i
gazed
at
him
i
grew
so
convinced
it
was
he
that
i
cried
out
the
moment
i
did
so
there
was
a
ghastly
change
his
eyelids
opened
and
his
eyes
eyes
i
recognised
at
once
protruded
to
such
a
degree
that
they
almost
rolled
out
his
mouth
flew
open
his
tongue
swelled
his
whole
countenance
became
convulsed
with
the
most
unparalleled
and
for
that
reason
indescribable
expression
of
agony
whilst
the
yellowness
of
his
complexion
deepened
to
a
livid
lurid
black
that
was
so
inconceivably
repellent
and
hellish
that
i
sprang
away
from
the
bed
appalled
there
was
then
a
gasping
rasping
noise
and
a
voice
that
despite
its
unnatural
hollowness
i
identified
as
that
of
ralph
broke
forth
have
been
wanting
to
speak
to
you
for
ages
but
i
can
not
explain
has
always
prevented
me
i
have
been
dead
a
month
not
cancer
but
dolly
poison
hely
i
shall
rest
in
peace
now
the
voice
stopped
there
was
a
rush
of
cold
air
laden
with
the
scent
of
the
drug
and
tainted
faintly
tainted
with
the
nauseating
smell
of
the
grave
and
the
face
on
the
pillow
vanished
how
i
got
through
the
remainder
of
the
night
i
can
not
say
i
dare
not
think
i
dare
only
remember
that
i
did
not
sleep
i
was
devoted
to
ralph
and
the
thought
that
he
had
perished
in
the
miserable
manner
suggested
by
the
apparition
completely
prostrated
me
in
the
morning
i
received
a
letter
from
my
mother
stating
that
she
had
just
heard
from
dolly
my
brother
wife
saying
ralph
had
died
from
cancer
in
the
throat
dolly
added
in
a
postscript
that
her
dearly
beloved
ralph
had
been
very
good
to
her
and
left
her
well
provided
for
of
course
we
might
have
had
the
body
exhumed
but
we
were
poor
and
ralph
widow
was
rich
and
in
america
you
know
everything
goes
in
favour
of
the
dollars
hence
we
were
obliged
to
let
the
matter
drop
sincerely
trusting
dolly
would
never
take
it
into
her
head
to
visit
us
she
never
did
my
mother
died
last
year
i
felt
her
death
terribly
and
as
i
no
longer
have
any
fixed
abode
but
am
always
touring
the
british
provinces
there
is
not
much
fear
of
ralph
murderess
and
i
meeting
it
is
rather
odd
however
that
after
my
own
experience
at
the
hotel
i
heard
that
it
had
borne
the
reputation
for
being
haunted
for
many
years
and
that
a
good
many
visitors
who
had
passed
the
night
in
one
of
the
rooms
presumably
mine
had
complained
of
hearing
strange
noises
and
having
dreadful
dreams
how
can
one
explain
it
all
one
ca
i
responded
as
we
turned
in
for
the
night
case
xii
the
grey
piper
and
the
heavy
coach
of
donaldgowerie
house
perth
donaldgowerie
house
until
comparatively
recent
times
stood
on
the
outskirts
of
perth
it
was
a
long
low
rambling
old
place
dating
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
at
the
time
of
the
narrative
it
was
in
the
possession
of
a
william
whittingen
who
bought
it
at
a
very
low
price
from
some
people
named
tyler
it
is
true
that
it
would
cost
a
small
fortune
to
repair
but
notwithstanding
this
disadvantage
whittingen
considered
his
purchase
a
bargain
and
was
more
than
satisfied
with
it
indeed
he
knew
of
no
other
house
of
a
similar
size
of
such
an
imposing
appearance
and
so
pleasantly
situated
that
he
could
have
bought
for
less
than
twice
the
amount
he
had
paid
for
this
and
he
was
really
very
sorry
for
the
tylers
who
explained
to
him
in
confidence
that
had
they
not
been
in
such
urgent
need
of
money
they
would
never
have
sold
donaldgowerie
house
at
such
a
ridiculously
low
figure
however
with
them
it
was
a
question
of
cash
cash
down
and
whittingen
had
only
to
write
out
a
cheque
for
the
modest
sum
they
asked
and
the
house
was
his
it
was
june
when
whittingen
took
possession
of
the
house
june
when
the
summer
sun
was
brightest
and
the
gardens
looked
their
best
the
whittingen
family
consisting
of
and
whittingen
two
sons
ernest
and
harvey
and
three
daughters
ruth
martha
and
mary
were
as
one
might
gather
from
their
names
alone
plain
practical
genteel
and
in
fact
very
superior
people
who
were
by
no
means
lacking
in
that
exceedingly
useful
quality
of
canniness
so
characteristic
of
the
lowland
scot
to
which
race
they
belonged
whittingen
had
for
years
conducted
a
grocery
business
in
jedburgh
twice
filling
the
honoured
and
coveted
post
of
mayor
and
when
he
at
length
retired
into
private
life
his
friends
and
it
was
astonishing
how
many
friends
he
had
shrewdly
suspected
that
his
pockets
were
not
only
well
lined
but
full
to
bursting
acting
on
the
advice
of
his
wife
and
daughters
who
were
keen
on
social
distinction
he
sent
ernest
to
oxford
conditionally
that
he
should
take
holy
orders
in
the
church
of
england
whilst
harvey
who
when
scarcely
out
of
the
petticoat
stage
displayed
the
regular
whittingen
talent
for
business
by
covertly
helping
himself
to
the
sugar
in
his
father
shop
and
disposing
of
it
at
strictly
sale
price
to
his
sisters
cronies
in
the
nursery
was
sent
to
one
of
those
half
preparatory
and
half
finishing
schools
of
course
for
the
sons
of
gentlemen
only
at
edinburgh
where
he
was
kept
till
he
was
old
enough
to
be
articled
to
a
prosperous
exceedingly
prosperous
firm
of
solicitors
the
girls
ruth
martha
and
mary
had
likewise
been
highly
educated
that
is
to
say
they
had
remained
so
many
years
at
an
english
seminary
for
young
ladies
and
had
been
given
a
final
twelve
months
in
france
and
germany
to
enable
them
to
obtain
the
correct
accent
at
the
time
of
the
story
they
were
as
yet
unmarried
and
were
awaiting
with
the
most
laudable
patience
the
advent
of
men
of
title
they
were
delighted
with
their
new
home
which
ruth
had
persuaded
her
father
to
christen
donaldgowerie
after
the
house
in
a
romantic
novel
she
had
just
been
reading
and
proud
of
their
gilded
premises
and
magnificent
tennis
lawns
they
had
placed
a
gigantic
and
costly
tray
in
the
hall
in
confident
assurance
that
it
would
speedily
groan
beneath
the
weight
of
cards
from
all
the
gentry
in
perthshire
but
please
be
it
understood
that
my
one
and
only
object
in
alluding
to
these
trifling
details
is
to
point
out
that
the
whittingens
being
entirely
engrossed
in
matters
mundane
were
the
very
last
people
in
the
world
to
be
termed
superstitious
and
although
imaginative
where
future
husbands
calls
and
cards
were
concerned
prior
to
the
events
about
to
be
narrated
had
not
an
ounce
of
superstition
in
their
natures
indeed
until
then
they
had
always
smiled
in
a
very
supercilious
manner
at
even
the
smallest
mention
of
a
ghost
september
came
their
first
september
in
donaldgowerie
and
the
family
welcomed
with
joy
ernest
and
his
youthful
bride
the
latter
was
not
as
they
had
fondly
hoped
and
roundly
announced
in
perth
the
daughter
of
a
peer
but
of
a
wealthy
bristol
draper
the
owner
of
a
house
near
the
downs
whose
son
had
been
one
of
many
friends
at
oxford
the
coming
of
the
pair
to
donaldgowerie
brought
with
it
a
burst
of
gaiety
all
sorts
of
entertainments
musical
at
homes
dinners
dances
tennis
and
garden
parties
in
fact
every
variety
that
accorded
with
the
idea
of
good
taste
were
given
and
with
praiseworthy
push
for
which
the
whittingens
had
fast
become
noted
all
the
county
was
invited
this
splendid
display
of
wealth
and
hospitality
was
not
disinterested
i
fear
it
might
be
not
only
accounted
a
send
off
for
the
curate
and
his
wife
but
also
a
determined
effort
on
the
part
of
and
whittingen
to
attract
the
right
sort
of
lover
for
their
girls
it
was
during
the
progress
of
one
of
their
alfresco
entertainments
that
the
scepticism
of
certain
of
the
whittingens
with
regard
to
the
supernatural
received
a
rude
blow
martha
mary
and
two
eligible
young
men
friends
of
harvey
having
finished
a
somewhat
spirited
game
of
croquet
were
refreshing
themselves
with
lemonade
whilst
they
continued
their
flirtation
presently
mary
whose
partner
declared
how
much
he
should
like
to
see
some
photographs
she
had
recently
had
taken
of
herself
with
a
giggle
of
embarrassment
set
off
to
the
house
to
fetch
her
album
the
minutes
passed
and
as
she
did
not
return
martha
went
in
search
of
her
the
album
she
knew
was
in
their
boudoir
which
was
situated
at
the
end
of
the
long
and
rather
gloomy
corridor
of
the
upper
storey
highly
incensed
at
her
sister
slowness
she
was
hastening
along
the
corridor
when
to
her
supreme
astonishment
she
suddenly
saw
the
figure
of
a
man
in
kilts
with
a
bagpipe
under
his
arm
emerge
through
the
door
of
the
boudoir
and
with
a
peculiar
gliding
motion
advance
towards
her
a
curious
feeling
with
which
she
was
totally
unfamiliar
compelled
her
to
remain
mute
and
motionless
and
in
this
condition
she
awaited
the
approach
of
the
stranger
who
was
he
she
asked
herself
and
how
on
earth
had
he
got
there
and
what
was
he
doing
as
he
drew
nearer
she
perceived
that
his
face
was
all
one
hue
a
ghastly
livid
grey
and
that
his
eyes
which
were
all
the
time
fixed
on
hers
were
lurid
and
menacing
so
terrible
in
fact
that
she
turned
cold
with
fear
and
felt
the
very
hair
on
her
head
beginning
to
rise
on
end
she
opened
her
mouth
to
shriek
but
found
she
could
not
ejaculate
a
syllable
neither
could
she
even
with
the
most
desperate
efforts
tear
her
feet
from
the
floor
on
came
the
figure
and
without
swerving
either
to
the
right
or
left
it
glided
right
up
to
and
through
her
and
as
she
involuntarily
turned
round
she
saw
it
disappear
through
a
staircase
window
at
least
twenty
feet
above
the
ground
outside
shaking
all
over
with
terror
and
not
understanding
in
the
slightest
what
to
make
of
it
martha
ran
to
the
boudoir
where
her
heart
almost
sprang
out
of
her
body
at
the
spectacle
of
her
sister
mary
stretched
at
full
length
on
the
floor
her
cheeks
ashy
pale
her
lips
blue
martha
at
once
made
a
frantic
rush
to
the
bell
and
in
a
few
minutes
half
the
establishment
headed
by
whittingen
poured
into
the
room
with
the
aid
of
a
little
cold
water
mary
speedily
recovered
and
in
reply
to
the
anxious
inquiries
of
her
sympathetic
rescuers
as
to
what
had
happened
indignantly
demanded
why
such
a
horrible
looking
creature
as
that
piper
had
been
allowed
not
merely
to
enter
the
house
but
to
come
up
to
her
room
and
half
frighten
her
to
death
i
had
just
got
my
album
she
added
when
feeling
some
one
was
in
the
room
i
turned
round
and
there
she
indicated
a
spot
on
the
carpet
was
the
piper
not
ten
paces
away
from
me
regarding
me
with
the
most
awful
look
imaginable
i
was
too
taken
aback
with
surprise
to
say
anything
nor
for
some
unaccountable
reason
could
i
escape
before
he
touched
me
on
the
shoulder
with
one
of
his
icy
cold
hands
and
then
commenced
playing
up
and
down
the
floor
he
paced
backwards
and
forwards
never
taking
his
hateful
glance
off
my
face
and
ever
piping
the
same
dismal
dirge
at
last
unable
to
stand
the
strain
of
it
any
longer
and
convinced
he
was
a
madman
bent
on
murdering
me
for
who
but
a
lunatic
would
behave
in
such
a
way
i
gave
way
to
a
violent
fit
of
hysterics
and
fainted
now
tell
me
who
he
was
and
why
he
was
permitted
to
frighten
me
in
this
manner
and
mary
stamped
her
feet
and
grew
vicious
as
only
her
class
will
when
they
are
at
all
vexed
her
speech
was
followed
by
a
silence
that
exasperated
her
she
repeated
her
inquiries
with
crimson
cheeks
and
then
as
again
no
one
responded
she
signalled
out
the
head
footman
and
raved
at
him
up
to
this
point
whittingen
had
been
dumb
with
amazement
the
idea
of
a
strange
piper
having
the
twofold
effrontery
to
enter
his
house
and
proceed
to
the
private
and
chaste
sanctuary
of
his
highly
respectable
daughters
almost
deprived
him
of
breath
he
could
scarcely
believe
his
ears
what
what
in
the
name
of
what
does
it
all
mean
he
at
length
stammered
addressing
the
unfortunate
footman
a
piper
and
without
any
invitation
from
me
how
dare
you
let
him
in
i
did
not
sir
the
luckless
footman
replied
no
such
person
came
to
the
door
when
i
was
in
the
hall
no
more
he
did
when
i
was
there
chimed
in
the
second
footman
and
all
the
other
servants
vociferated
in
a
body
we
never
saw
any
piper
sir
nor
heard
one
either
and
they
looked
at
mary
reproachfully
at
this
whittingen
looked
exceedingly
embarrassed
in
the
face
of
such
a
unanimous
denial
what
could
he
say
he
knew
if
he
suggested
the
servants
were
untruthful
they
would
all
give
notice
to
leave
on
the
spot
and
knowing
good
servants
are
scarce
in
perth
as
elsewhere
he
felt
rather
in
a
fix
at
length
turning
to
mary
he
asked
if
she
was
sure
it
was
a
piper
sure
mary
screamed
why
of
course
i
am
did
i
not
tell
you
he
marched
up
and
down
here
playing
on
his
disgusting
bagpipes
which
nearly
broke
the
drum
of
my
ear
and
i
saw
him
too
pa
martha
put
in
i
met
him
in
the
corridor
he
had
his
pipes
under
his
arm
and
the
most
dreadful
expression
in
his
face
i
do
wonder
mary
was
frightened
but
where
did
he
go
whittingen
cried
you
would
not
believe
me
if
i
told
you
martha
said
her
cheeks
flushing
he
seemed
to
pass
right
through
me
and
then
to
vanish
through
the
staircase
window
i
have
never
been
so
terribly
upset
in
my
life
and
sinking
on
to
the
sofa
she
began
to
laugh
hysterically
dear
me
dear
me
it
is
very
odd
whittingen
exclaimed
as
mary
handed
her
sister
a
wineglass
of
they
ca
both
have
been
dreaming
it
must
but
there
what
a
nonsensical
notion
there
are
no
such
things
as
ghosts
only
children
and
nursemaids
believe
in
them
nowadays
as
soon
as
you
have
quite
recovered
my
dears
we
will
return
to
the
garden
and
i
think
that
under
the
circumstances
the
rather
peculiar
circumstances
ahem
it
will
be
better
to
say
nothing
to
your
mother
do
you
understand
whittingen
went
on
eyeing
the
servants
nothing
to
your
mistress
the
affair
thus
terminated
and
for
some
days
nothing
further
happened
to
disturb
the
peace
of
the
family
at
the
end
of
a
week
however
exactly
a
week
after
the
appearance
of
the
piper
mary
met
with
a
serious
accident
she
was
running
across
the
croquet
lawn
to
speak
to
her
when
she
tripped
over
a
hoop
that
had
been
accidentally
left
there
and
in
falling
ran
a
hatpin
into
her
head
blood
poisoning
ensued
and
within
a
fortnight
she
was
dead
martha
was
the
only
one
in
the
house
however
who
associated
mary
accident
and
death
with
the
piper
to
her
that
sinister
expression
in
the
mysterious
highlander
eyes
portended
mischief
and
she
could
not
but
suspect
that
in
some
way
or
another
he
had
brought
about
the
catastrophe
the
autumn
waned
and
christmas
was
well
within
sight
when
another
mysterious
occurrence
took
place
it
was
early
one
sunday
evening
tea
was
just
over
and
the
whittingen
family
were
sitting
round
the
fire
engaged
in
a
somewhat
melancholy
conversation
for
the
loss
of
mary
had
affected
them
all
very
deeply
when
they
heard
the
rumble
of
a
heavy
coach
on
the
nearer
and
nearer
it
came
till
it
seemed
to
be
about
on
a
level
with
the
front
lodge
gate
then
to
their
surprise
there
was
a
loud
crunching
of
gravel
and
they
heard
it
careering
at
a
breakneck
speed
up
the
they
looked
at
one
another
in
the
utmost
consternation
a
coach
and
driven
in
this
mad
fashion
whose
was
it
what
did
it
mean
not
visitors
surely
it
pulled
up
at
the
front
door
and
the
champing
and
stamping
of
the
horses
vibrated
loudly
through
the
still
night
air
sounds
as
of
one
or
more
people
descending
were
next
heard
and
then
there
came
a
series
of
the
most
terrific
knockings
at
the
door
the
whittingen
family
stared
at
one
another
aghast
there
was
something
in
those
knockings
something
they
could
not
explain
that
struck
terror
in
their
souls
and
made
their
blood
run
cold
they
waited
in
breathless
anxiety
for
the
door
to
be
opened
but
no
servant
went
to
open
it
the
knocks
were
repeated
if
anything
louder
than
before
the
door
swung
back
on
its
hinges
and
the
tread
of
heavy
footsteps
were
heard
slowly
approaching
the
whittingen
gave
a
low
gasp
of
horror
ruth
screamed
harvey
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
whittingen
rose
to
his
feet
and
made
desperate
efforts
to
get
to
the
bell
but
could
not
stir
whilst
martha
rushed
to
the
door
and
locked
it
they
then
with
one
accord
began
to
pray
the
steps
halted
outside
the
room
the
door
slowly
opened
and
the
blurred
outlines
of
a
group
of
figures
supporting
a
grotesquely
shaped
object
in
their
midst
appeared
on
the
threshold
for
some
seconds
there
was
a
grim
silence
it
was
abruptly
broken
by
a
thud
ruth
had
slipped
from
her
chair
to
the
floor
in
a
dead
faint
whereupon
the
shadowy
forms
solemnly
veered
round
and
made
their
way
back
again
to
the
front
door
the
latter
swung
violently
open
there
was
a
rush
of
icy
wind
which
swept
like
a
hurricane
across
the
hall
and
into
the
the
front
door
then
slammed
to
with
a
crash
and
the
coach
drove
away
every
one
attention
was
now
directed
to
ruth
at
first
and
cold
water
produced
no
effect
but
after
a
time
she
slowly
very
slowly
regained
consciousness
as
soon
as
she
had
recovered
sufficiently
to
speak
she
expressed
an
earnest
desire
that
no
reference
should
ever
be
made
in
her
presence
to
what
had
just
happened
it
was
for
me
she
said
in
such
an
emphatic
tone
as
filled
her
audience
with
the
direst
forebodings
i
know
it
was
for
me
they
all
looked
in
my
direction
god
help
me
i
shall
die
like
mary
though
greatly
perplexed
as
to
what
she
meant
for
no
one
excepting
herself
had
been
able
to
make
out
the
phenomena
with
any
degree
of
distinctness
they
yielded
to
her
entreaties
and
asked
her
no
questions
the
servants
had
neither
heard
nor
seen
anything
a
fortnight
later
ruth
was
taken
ill
with
appendicitis
peritonitis
speedily
set
in
and
she
died
under
the
operation
the
whittingens
now
began
to
wish
they
had
never
come
to
donaldgowerie
but
with
the
astuteness
that
had
been
characteristic
of
the
family
through
countless
generations
of
fair
days
and
foul
they
took
the
greatest
precautions
never
to
drop
even
as
much
as
a
hint
to
the
servants
or
to
any
one
in
the
town
that
the
house
was
haunted
a
year
passed
without
any
further
catastrophe
and
they
were
beginning
to
hope
their
ghastly
visitors
had
left
them
when
something
else
occurred
it
was
and
ernest
his
wife
and
baby
were
staying
with
them
the
baby
a
boy
was
fat
and
bonny
the
very
picture
of
health
and
happiness
whittingen
and
martha
vied
with
one
another
in
their
devotion
to
him
and
either
one
or
other
of
them
was
always
dancing
attendance
on
him
it
so
happened
that
one
afternoon
whilst
the
servants
were
having
their
tea
martha
found
herself
alone
in
the
upper
part
of
the
house
with
her
precious
nephew
whittingen
had
gone
to
edinburgh
to
consult
his
lawyer
the
head
of
the
firm
with
whom
harvey
was
articled
on
business
whilst
whittingen
had
taken
her
son
and
for
a
drive
the
weather
was
glorious
and
martha
though
as
little
appreciative
of
the
beauties
of
nature
as
most
young
women
could
not
but
admire
the
colouring
of
the
sky
as
she
looked
out
of
the
nursery
window
the
sun
had
disappeared
but
the
effect
of
its
rays
was
still
apparent
on
the
western
horizon
where
the
heavens
were
washed
with
alternate
streaks
of
gold
and
red
and
pink
the
colour
of
each
streak
excessively
brilliant
in
the
centre
but
paling
towards
the
edges
here
and
there
were
golden
clouds
and
crimson
islets
surrounded
with
seas
of
softest
blue
and
outside
the
limits
of
this
pale
the
blue
of
the
sky
gradually
grew
darker
and
darker
until
its
line
was
altogether
lost
in
the
black
shadows
of
night
that
creeping
over
the
lone
in
the
far
east
slowly
swept
forward
wafted
by
the
gentle
breeze
came
the
dull
moaning
and
whispering
of
the
pine
trees
the
humming
of
the
wind
through
the
telephone
wires
and
the
discordant
cawing
of
the
crows
and
it
seemed
to
martha
as
she
sat
there
and
peered
out
into
the
garden
that
over
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
place
had
come
a
subtle
and
hostile
change
a
change
in
the
noises
of
the
trees
the
birds
the
wind
a
change
in
the
ether
a
change
a
most
marked
and
emphatic
change
in
the
shadows
what
was
it
what
was
this
change
whence
did
it
originate
what
did
it
portend
a
slight
noise
a
most
trivial
noise
attracted
martha
attention
to
the
room
she
looked
round
and
was
quite
startled
to
see
how
dark
it
had
grown
in
the
old
days
when
she
had
scoffed
at
ghosts
she
would
as
soon
have
been
in
the
dark
as
in
the
light
the
night
had
no
terrors
for
her
but
now
now
since
those
awful
occurrences
last
year
all
was
different
and
as
she
peered
apprehensively
about
her
her
flesh
crawled
what
was
there
in
that
corner
opposite
that
corner
hemmed
in
on
the
one
side
by
the
cupboard
how
she
hated
cupboards
particularly
when
they
had
shiny
surfaces
on
which
were
reflected
all
sorts
of
curious
things
and
the
chest
of
drawers
on
the
other
it
was
a
shadow
only
a
shadow
but
of
what
she
searched
the
room
everywhere
to
find
its
material
counterpart
and
at
last
discovered
it
in
the
nurse
shawl
which
hung
over
the
back
of
a
chair
then
she
laughed
and
would
have
gone
on
laughing
for
she
tried
to
persuade
herself
that
laughter
banished
ghosts
when
suddenly
something
else
caught
her
eyes
what
was
it
an
object
that
glittered
evilly
like
two
eyes
she
got
up
in
a
state
of
the
most
hideous
fascination
and
walked
towards
it
then
she
laughed
again
it
was
a
pair
of
scissors
the
nurse
scissors
clean
bright
and
sharp
why
did
she
pick
them
up
and
feel
the
blades
so
caressingly
with
her
thumb
why
did
she
glance
from
them
to
the
baby
why
in
the
name
of
god
why
frightful
ideas
laid
hold
of
her
mind
she
tried
to
chase
them
away
but
they
quickly
returned
the
scissors
why
were
they
in
her
fingers
why
could
not
she
put
them
down
for
what
were
they
intended
cutting
cutting
thread
and
tape
and
throats
throats
and
she
giggled
hysterically
at
the
bare
notion
but
what
was
this
round
her
waist
this
shadowy
object
she
looked
fearfully
round
and
her
soul
died
within
her
as
she
encountered
the
malevolent
gleeful
eyes
of
the
sinister
piper
pressed
closely
against
her
face
was
it
she
he
wanted
this
time
she
or
or
whom
in
the
name
of
all
that
was
pitiable
desperately
as
if
all
the
lives
in
the
universe
and
the
future
of
her
soul
were
at
stake
did
she
struggle
to
free
herself
from
his
grasp
but
in
vain
every
fibre
every
muscle
of
her
body
was
completely
at
his
will
on
and
on
he
pushed
her
until
foot
by
foot
inch
by
inch
she
approached
the
cradle
and
all
the
while
his
hellish
voice
was
breathing
the
vilest
of
inspirations
into
her
brain
at
last
she
stood
by
the
side
of
the
baby
and
bent
over
it
what
a
darling
what
a
dear
what
a
duck
a
sweet
pretty
innocent
prattling
duck
how
like
her
mother
how
like
her
handsome
brother
how
like
herself
very
very
like
herself
how
every
one
loved
it
how
every
one
worshipped
it
how
and
here
the
grey
face
beside
her
chuckled
every
one
would
miss
it
how
pink
its
toes
how
fat
its
calves
how
chubby
its
little
palms
how
bonny
its
cheeks
and
how
white
how
gloriously
heavenly
snowy
white
its
throat
and
she
stretched
forth
one
of
her
stubby
inartistic
fingers
and
played
with
its
flesh
then
she
glanced
furtively
at
the
scissors
and
smiled
it
was
soon
done
soon
over
and
she
and
the
piper
danced
a
minuet
in
the
moonbeams
afterwards
he
piped
a
farewell
dirge
a
wild
weird
funereal
dirge
and
marching
slowly
backwards
his
dark
gleaming
eyes
fixed
gloatingly
on
hers
disappeared
through
the
window
then
the
reaction
set
in
and
martha
raved
and
shrieked
till
every
one
in
the
house
flew
to
the
rescue
of
course
no
one
saving
her
father
and
mother
believed
her
ernest
his
wife
and
the
servants
attributed
her
bloody
act
to
jealousy
the
law
to
madness
and
she
subsequently
journeyed
from
donaldgowerie
to
a
criminal
lunatic
asylum
where
the
recollection
of
all
she
had
done
soon
killed
her
this
was
the
climax
whittingen
sold
donaldgowerie
and
a
new
house
was
shortly
afterwards
erected
in
its
stead
case
xiii
the
floating
head
of
the
benrachett
inn
near
the
perth
road
dundee
some
years
ago
when
i
was
engaged
in
collecting
cases
for
a
book
i
contemplated
publishing
on
houses
in
england
and
i
was
introduced
to
an
irish
clergyman
whose
name
i
have
forgotten
and
whom
i
have
never
met
since
had
the
incident
he
related
taken
place
in
england
or
wales
i
should
have
noted
it
down
carefully
but
as
it
occurred
in
scotland
and
i
had
no
intention
then
of
bringing
out
a
volume
on
scottish
phantasms
i
did
not
do
so
my
memory
however
i
can
assure
my
readers
in
spite
of
the
many
ghost
tales
committed
to
it
for
scarcely
a
day
passes
that
i
do
not
hear
one
seldom
fails
and
the
irish
clergyman
story
which
i
am
about
to
relate
comes
back
to
me
now
with
startling
vividness
one
summer
evening
early
in
the
eighties
murphy
the
name
by
which
i
will
designate
the
originator
of
this
story
and
his
wife
arrived
in
dundee
the
town
was
utterly
unknown
to
them
and
they
were
touring
scotland
for
the
first
time
not
knowing
where
to
put
up
for
the
night
and
knowing
no
one
to
whom
they
could
apply
for
information
they
consulted
a
local
paper
and
from
the
long
list
of
hotels
and
advertised
therein
selected
the
benrachett
inn
near
the
perth
road
as
being
the
one
most
likely
to
meet
their
modest
requirements
they
were
certainly
not
disappointed
with
the
exterior
of
the
hotel
they
had
chosen
for
as
soon
as
they
saw
it
they
exclaimed
simultaneously
what
a
delightful
old
place
and
old
it
certainly
was
for
the
oaken
structure
and
projecting
windows
unquestionably
indicated
the
sixteenth
century
whilst
to
enhance
the
effect
and
give
it
a
true
touch
in
detail
of
ye
ancient
times
a
huge
antique
lantern
was
hung
over
the
entrance
nor
did
the
interior
impress
them
less
favourably
the
rooms
were
large
and
low
the
ceilings
walls
floors
and
staircase
all
of
oak
the
windows
and
narrow
tortuous
passages
and
innumerable
nooks
and
crannies
and
cupboards
created
an
atmosphere
of
combined
quaintness
and
comfort
that
irresistibly
appealed
to
the
murphys
viewed
under
the
searching
rays
of
the
sun
and
cheered
by
the
voices
of
the
visitors
the
interior
of
the
house
for
artistic
taste
and
cheerfulness
would
indeed
be
hard
to
beat
but
as
murphy
eyes
wandered
up
the
stairs
and
down
the
corridors
she
was
filled
with
misgivings
as
to
how
the
place
would
strike
her
at
night
though
not
nervous
naturally
and
by
no
means
superstitious
at
night
when
the
house
was
dark
and
silent
and
the
moon
called
forth
the
shadows
she
was
not
without
that
feeling
of
uneasiness
which
most
people
even
avowed
sceptics
experience
when
passing
the
night
in
strange
and
novel
quarters
the
room
they
engaged
i
can
not
say
selected
as
the
hotel
being
full
they
had
hobson
choice
was
at
the
end
of
a
very
long
passage
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
overlooking
the
yard
it
was
a
large
apartment
and
in
one
of
its
several
recesses
stood
the
bed
a
gigantic
ebony
with
spotlessly
clean
valance
and
what
was
of
even
greater
importance
sheets
the
other
furniture
in
the
room
being
of
the
same
sort
as
that
in
the
majority
of
hostels
needs
no
description
but
a
fixture
in
the
shape
of
a
cupboard
a
deep
dark
cupboard
let
into
the
wall
facing
the
bed
instantly
attracted
murphy
attention
there
is
always
something
interesting
in
cupboards
particularly
old
and
roomy
cupboards
when
it
is
and
one
is
about
to
get
into
bed
it
is
then
that
they
suggest
all
manner
of
fascinating
possibilities
it
was
to
this
cupboard
then
that
murphy
paid
the
greatest
attention
before
commencing
to
undress
prior
to
getting
into
bed
she
poked
about
in
it
for
some
moments
and
then
apparently
satisfied
that
no
one
was
hidden
there
continued
her
investigation
of
the
room
murphy
did
not
assist
he
pleaded
fatigue
and
sat
on
the
corner
of
the
bed
munching
a
gingerbread
and
reading
the
till
the
operation
was
over
he
then
helped
murphy
unpack
their
portmanteau
and
during
the
process
whiled
away
so
much
time
in
conversation
that
they
were
both
startled
when
a
clock
from
some
adjacent
church
solemnly
boomed
twelve
they
were
then
seized
with
something
approaching
a
panic
and
hastened
to
disrobe
i
wish
we
had
a
john
murphy
said
as
she
got
up
from
her
prayers
i
suppose
it
would
do
to
keep
one
of
the
candles
burning
i
am
not
exactly
afraid
only
i
do
fancy
being
left
in
the
dark
i
had
a
curious
sensation
when
i
was
in
the
cupboard
just
now
i
ca
exactly
explain
it
but
i
feel
now
that
i
would
like
the
light
left
burning
it
certainly
is
rather
a
gloomy
room
murphy
remarked
raising
his
eyes
to
the
black
oak
ceiling
and
then
allowing
them
to
dwell
in
turn
on
each
of
the
angles
and
recesses
and
i
agree
with
you
it
would
be
nice
if
we
had
a
or
better
still
gas
but
as
we
have
my
dear
and
we
shall
be
on
our
feet
a
good
deal
i
think
we
ought
to
try
and
get
to
sleep
as
soon
as
possible
he
blew
out
the
candle
as
he
spoke
and
quickly
scrambled
into
bed
a
long
hush
followed
broken
only
by
the
sound
of
breathing
and
an
occasional
ticking
as
of
some
creature
on
the
wall
and
murphy
could
never
remember
if
she
actually
went
to
sleep
but
she
is
sure
her
husband
did
as
she
distinctly
heard
him
snore
and
the
sound
so
detestable
to
her
as
a
rule
was
so
welcome
to
her
then
she
was
lying
listening
to
it
and
wishing
with
all
her
soul
she
could
get
to
sleep
when
she
suddenly
became
aware
of
a
smell
a
most
offensive
pungent
odour
that
blew
across
the
room
and
crept
up
her
nostrils
the
cold
perspiration
of
fear
at
once
broke
out
on
her
forehead
nasty
as
the
smell
was
it
suggested
something
more
horrible
something
she
dared
not
attempt
to
analyse
she
thought
several
times
of
rousing
her
husband
but
remembering
how
tired
he
had
been
she
desisted
and
with
all
her
faculties
abnormally
on
the
alert
she
lay
awake
and
listened
a
deathlike
hush
hung
over
the
house
interrupted
at
intervals
by
the
surreptitious
noises
peculiar
to
the
night
enigmatical
creaks
and
footsteps
rustlings
as
of
drapery
sighs
and
whisperings
all
very
faint
all
very
subtle
and
all
possibly
just
possibly
attributable
to
natural
causes
murphy
caught
herself
why
she
could
not
say
waiting
for
some
definite
auditory
manifestation
of
what
she
instinctively
felt
was
near
at
hand
at
present
however
she
could
not
locate
it
she
could
only
speculate
on
its
whereabouts
it
was
somewhere
in
the
direction
of
the
cupboard
and
each
time
the
stench
came
to
her
the
conviction
that
its
origin
was
in
the
cupboard
grew
at
last
unable
to
sustain
the
suspense
any
longer
and
urged
on
by
an
irresistible
fascination
she
got
softly
out
of
bed
and
creeping
stealthily
forward
found
her
way
with
surprisingly
little
difficulty
considering
it
was
pitch
dark
and
the
room
was
unfamiliar
to
her
to
the
cupboard
with
every
step
she
took
the
stink
increased
and
by
the
time
she
had
reached
the
cupboard
she
was
almost
suffocated
for
some
seconds
she
toyed
irresolutely
with
the
door
handle
longing
to
be
back
again
in
bed
but
unable
to
tear
herself
away
from
the
cupboard
at
last
yielding
to
the
demands
of
some
pitilessly
exacting
unknown
influence
she
held
her
breath
and
swung
open
the
door
the
moment
she
did
so
the
room
filled
with
the
faint
phosphorescent
glow
of
decay
and
she
saw
exactly
opposite
her
a
head
a
human
head
floating
in
petrified
with
terror
she
lost
every
atom
of
strength
and
entirely
bereft
of
the
power
to
move
or
articulate
a
sound
she
stood
staring
at
it
that
it
was
the
head
of
a
man
she
could
only
guess
from
the
matted
crop
of
short
red
hair
that
fell
in
a
disordered
entanglement
over
the
upper
part
of
the
forehead
and
ears
all
else
was
lost
in
a
loathsome
disgusting
mass
of
detestable
decomposition
too
utterly
vile
and
foul
to
describe
on
the
abnormal
thing
beginning
to
move
forward
the
spell
that
bound
murphy
to
the
floor
was
broken
and
with
a
cry
of
horror
she
fled
to
the
bed
and
awoke
her
husband
the
head
was
by
this
time
close
to
them
and
had
not
murphy
dragged
her
husband
forcibly
out
of
its
way
it
would
have
touched
him
his
terror
was
even
greater
than
hers
but
for
the
moment
neither
could
speak
they
stood
clutching
one
another
in
an
awful
silence
murphy
at
length
gasped
out
pray
john
pray
command
the
thing
in
the
name
of
god
to
depart
murphy
made
a
desperate
effort
to
do
so
but
not
a
syllable
would
come
the
head
now
veered
round
and
was
moving
swiftly
towards
them
its
awful
stench
causing
them
both
to
retch
and
vomit
murphy
seizing
his
stick
lashed
at
it
with
all
his
might
the
result
was
one
they
might
well
have
expected
the
stick
met
with
no
resistance
and
the
head
continued
to
advance
both
and
murphy
then
made
a
frantic
attempt
to
find
the
door
the
head
still
pursuing
them
and
tripping
over
something
in
their
wild
haste
fell
together
on
the
floor
there
was
now
no
hope
the
head
had
caught
them
up
it
hovered
immediately
above
them
and
descending
lower
lower
and
lower
finally
passed
right
through
them
through
the
floor
and
out
of
sight
it
was
long
ere
either
of
them
could
sufficiently
recover
to
stir
from
the
floor
and
when
they
did
move
it
was
only
to
totter
to
their
bed
and
to
lie
with
the
bedclothes
well
over
their
heads
quivering
and
quaking
till
the
morning
the
hot
morning
sun
dissipating
their
fears
they
got
up
and
hurrying
downstairs
demanded
an
interview
with
their
landlord
it
was
in
vain
the
latter
argued
it
was
all
a
nightmare
they
showed
the
absurdity
of
such
a
theory
by
vehemently
attesting
they
had
both
simultaneously
experienced
the
phenomena
they
were
about
to
take
their
departure
when
the
landlord
retracting
all
he
had
said
offered
them
another
room
and
any
terms
they
liked
if
only
they
would
stay
and
hold
their
tongues
i
know
every
word
of
what
you
say
is
true
he
said
in
such
submissive
tones
that
the
tender
hearts
of
and
murphy
instantly
relented
and
they
promised
to
remain
but
what
am
i
to
do
i
can
not
shut
up
a
house
which
i
have
taken
on
a
twenty
years
lease
because
one
room
in
it
is
haunted
and
after
all
there
is
only
one
visitor
in
twenty
who
is
disturbed
by
the
apparition
what
is
the
history
of
the
head
why
it
is
said
to
be
that
of
a
pedlar
who
was
murdered
here
over
a
hundred
years
ago
the
body
was
hidden
behind
the
wainscoting
and
his
head
under
the
cupboard
floor
the
miscreants
were
never
caught
they
are
supposed
to
have
gone
down
in
a
ship
that
sailed
from
this
port
just
about
that
time
and
was
never
heard
of
again
this
is
the
gist
of
the
story
the
clergyman
told
me
and
believing
it
as
i
undoubtedly
do
to
be
true
there
is
every
reason
to
suppose
that
the
inn
to
which
i
have
of
course
given
a
fictitious
name
if
still
in
existence
is
still
haunted
case
xiv
the
hauntings
of
house
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
great
western
road
aberdeen
the
following
experience
of
a
haunting
is
that
of
scarfe
who
told
it
me
some
few
summers
ago
expressing
at
the
same
time
great
eagerness
to
accompany
me
on
some
of
my
investigations
i
append
it
as
nearly
as
possible
in
his
own
words
i
was
spending
easter
he
began
with
some
friends
of
mine
in
aberdeen
and
learning
from
them
that
there
was
a
haunted
house
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
great
western
road
i
begged
them
to
try
and
get
me
permission
to
spend
a
night
in
it
as
good
luck
would
have
it
the
landlord
happened
to
be
a
connection
of
theirs
and
although
at
first
rather
reluctant
to
give
me
leave
lest
by
doing
so
he
should
create
a
precedent
and
consequently
be
pestered
to
death
by
people
whom
he
knew
to
be
as
anxious
as
i
was
to
see
the
ghost
he
eventually
yielded
and
the
following
evening
at
accompanied
only
by
my
dog
scott
i
entered
the
premises
i
can
not
say
i
felt
very
comfortable
when
the
door
slammed
behind
me
and
i
found
myself
standing
alone
in
a
cold
dark
passage
out
of
which
rose
a
gloomy
staircase
suggestive
of
all
sorts
of
uncanny
possibilities
however
overcoming
these
nervous
apprehensions
as
best
i
could
i
began
a
thorough
search
of
the
premises
to
make
sure
that
no
one
was
hiding
there
descending
first
of
all
into
the
basement
i
explored
the
kitchen
scullery
larder
and
other
domestic
offices
the
place
fairly
reeked
with
damp
but
this
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
taking
in
consideration
the
fact
that
the
soil
was
clay
the
floor
of
the
very
poorest
quality
of
cement
cracked
and
broken
in
a
dozen
and
one
places
and
that
there
had
been
no
fires
in
any
of
the
rooms
for
many
months
here
and
there
in
the
darkest
corners
were
clusters
of
ugly
cockroaches
whilst
more
than
one
monstrous
rat
scampered
away
on
my
approach
my
dog
or
rather
the
dog
that
was
lent
me
and
which
went
by
the
name
of
scott
kept
close
at
my
heel
showing
no
very
great
enthusiasm
in
his
mission
and
giving
even
the
rodents
as
wide
a
berth
as
possible
i
invariably
trust
to
my
psychic
faculty
as
you
know
some
people
are
born
with
the
faculty
to
enable
me
to
detect
the
presence
of
the
superphysical
i
generally
feel
the
latter
incorporated
in
some
inexplicable
manner
in
the
ether
or
see
it
inextricably
interwoven
with
the
shadows
here
in
the
basement
it
was
everywhere
the
air
was
simply
saturated
with
it
and
as
the
fading
sunlight
called
shadow
after
shadow
into
existence
it
confronted
me
enigmatically
whichever
way
i
turned
i
went
upstairs
and
the
presence
followed
me
in
one
or
two
of
the
top
bedrooms
more
particularly
in
a
tiny
garret
overlooking
the
the
presence
seemed
inclined
to
hover
for
some
seconds
i
waited
there
in
order
to
see
if
there
would
be
any
further
development
there
being
none
i
obeyed
the
mandates
of
a
sudden
impulse
and
made
my
way
once
more
to
the
basement
on
arriving
at
the
top
of
the
kitchen
stairs
scott
showed
a
decided
disinclination
to
descend
farther
crouching
down
he
whined
piteously
and
when
i
attempted
to
grasp
him
by
the
collar
snarled
in
a
most
savage
manner
consequently
thinking
it
better
to
have
no
companion
at
all
than
one
so
unwilling
i
descended
without
him
the
stairs
terminated
in
a
very
dark
and
narrow
passage
into
which
the
doors
of
the
kitchen
larder
store
room
opened
respectively
and
at
the
farther
extremity
of
which
was
a
doorway
leading
to
the
the
superphysical
presence
seeming
to
be
more
pronounced
in
this
passage
than
anywhere
else
i
decided
to
spend
the
night
in
it
and
selecting
a
spot
opposite
the
entrance
to
the
scullery
i
constructed
a
seat
out
of
two
of
the
drawers
of
the
kitchen
dresser
by
placing
them
one
on
the
other
bottom
uppermost
on
the
floor
it
was
now
nine
the
traffic
in
the
street
overhead
was
beginning
to
diminish
the
rumbling
of
drays
or
heavy
had
almost
ceased
whilst
the
jingling
of
hansoms
and
even
the
piercing
and
loud
of
motors
was
fast
becoming
less
and
less
frequent
i
put
out
my
candle
and
waited
and
as
i
waited
the
hush
and
gloom
of
the
house
deepened
and
intensified
until
by
midnight
all
round
me
was
black
and
silent
black
with
a
blackness
that
defies
penetration
and
silent
with
a
silence
that
challenges
only
the
rivalry
of
the
grave
occasionally
i
heard
sounds
such
for
example
as
the
creaking
of
a
board
the
flopping
of
a
cockroach
and
the
growling
of
scott
sounds
which
in
the
daytime
would
have
been
too
trivial
to
attract
attention
but
which
now
assumed
the
most
startling
and
exaggerated
proportions
from
time
to
time
i
felt
my
pulse
and
took
my
temperature
to
make
sure
that
i
was
perfectly
normal
whilst
at
one
the
hour
when
human
vitality
begins
to
be
on
the
wane
i
ate
some
chicken
and
ham
sandwiches
which
i
helped
down
with
a
single
glass
of
oatmeal
stout
so
far
beyond
my
feeling
that
there
was
a
superphysical
something
in
the
house
nothing
had
occurred
there
had
not
been
the
slightest
attempt
at
manifestation
and
as
the
minutes
sped
swiftly
by
i
began
to
fear
that
perhaps
after
all
the
hauntings
were
only
of
a
negative
nature
as
the
clock
struck
two
however
scott
gave
an
extra
savage
snarl
and
the
next
moment
came
racing
downstairs
darting
along
the
passage
and
tearing
towards
me
he
scrambled
up
the
overturned
drawers
and
burying
his
face
in
my
lap
set
up
the
most
piteous
whinings
a
sensation
of
icy
coldness
such
as
could
not
have
been
due
to
any
physical
cause
now
surged
through
me
and
as
i
got
out
my
pocket
flashlight
ready
for
emergencies
i
heard
an
unmistakable
rustling
in
the
cellar
opposite
at
once
my
whole
attention
became
riveted
in
the
direction
of
this
sound
and
as
i
sat
gazing
fixedly
in
front
of
me
the
darkness
was
suddenly
dissipated
and
the
whole
passage
from
one
end
to
the
other
was
illuminated
by
a
phosphorescent
glow
which
glow
i
can
best
describe
as
bearing
a
close
resemblance
in
kind
though
not
in
degree
to
the
glow
of
a
i
then
saw
the
scullery
door
slowly
begin
to
open
a
hideous
fear
seized
me
what
what
in
the
name
of
heaven
should
i
see
transfixed
with
terror
unable
to
move
or
utter
a
sound
i
crouched
against
the
wall
paralysed
helpless
whilst
the
door
opened
wider
and
wider
at
last
at
last
after
an
interval
which
to
me
was
eternity
something
an
as
yet
indefinite
shadowy
something
loomed
in
the
background
of
the
enlargening
space
my
suspense
was
now
sublime
and
i
felt
that
another
second
or
so
of
such
tension
would
assuredly
see
me
swoon
the
shadowy
something
however
quickly
developed
and
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
write
it
assumed
the
form
of
a
woman
a
woman
with
a
startlingly
white
face
straight
nose
and
curiously
lined
mouth
the
two
front
upper
teeth
of
which
projected
considerably
and
were
very
long
her
hair
was
black
her
hands
coarse
and
red
and
she
was
clad
in
the
orthodox
shabby
print
of
a
general
servant
in
some
family
the
expression
in
her
glassy
blue
eyes
as
they
glared
into
mine
was
one
of
such
intense
mental
and
physical
agony
that
i
felt
every
atom
of
blood
in
my
veins
congeal
creeping
stealthily
forward
her
gaze
still
on
me
she
emerged
from
the
doorway
and
motioning
to
me
to
follow
glided
up
the
staircase
up
up
we
went
the
cold
grey
dawn
greeting
us
on
our
way
entering
the
garret
to
which
i
have
already
alluded
the
phantasm
noiselessly
approached
the
hearth
and
pointing
downward
with
a
violent
motion
of
the
index
finger
of
its
right
hand
suddenly
vanished
a
great
feeling
of
relief
now
came
over
me
and
yielding
to
a
reaction
which
was
the
inevitable
consequence
of
such
a
severe
nervous
strain
i
reeled
against
the
and
shook
with
laughter
equanimity
at
length
reasserting
itself
i
carefully
marked
the
spot
on
the
floor
indicated
by
the
apparition
and
descending
into
the
basement
to
fetch
scott
made
hurried
tracks
to
my
friends
house
where
i
was
allowed
to
sleep
on
till
late
in
the
day
i
then
returned
to
the
haunted
house
with
the
landlord
and
my
friend
and
on
raising
the
boarding
in
the
garret
we
discovered
a
stamped
and
addressed
envelope
as
the
result
of
our
combined
inquiries
we
learned
that
a
few
years
previously
the
house
had
been
occupied
by
some
tradespeople
of
the
name
of
piblington
who
some
six
or
seven
months
before
they
left
the
house
had
had
in
their
employment
a
servant
named
anna
webb
this
servant
the
description
of
whose
person
corresponded
in
every
way
with
the
ghost
i
had
seen
had
been
suspected
of
stealing
a
letter
containing
money
and
had
hanged
herself
in
the
cellar
the
letter
i
gathered
with
several
others
had
been
given
to
anna
to
post
by
piblington
and
as
no
reply
to
the
one
containing
money
was
received
anna
was
closely
questioned
naturally
nervous
and
highly
strung
the
inquisition
confused
her
terribly
and
her
embarrassment
being
construed
into
guilt
she
was
threatened
with
prosecution
as
a
proof
of
my
innocence
she
scribbled
on
a
piece
of
paper
which
was
produced
at
the
subsequent
inquest
i
am
going
to
hang
myself
i
never
stole
your
letter
and
can
only
suppose
it
was
lost
in
the
post
the
mere
fact
of
the
accused
committing
suicide
would
in
many
people
opinion
point
to
guilt
and
as
the
postal
order
was
never
traced
it
was
generally
concluded
that
anna
had
secreted
it
and
had
been
only
waiting
till
inquiries
ceased
and
the
affair
was
forgotten
to
cash
it
of
course
the
letter
i
found
was
the
missing
one
and
although
apparently
hidden
with
intent
the
fact
of
its
never
having
been
opened
seemed
to
suggest
that
anna
was
innocent
and
that
the
envelope
had
by
some
extraordinary
accident
fallen
unnoticed
by
anna
through
the
crack
between
the
boards
anyhow
its
discovery
put
an
end
to
the
disturbances
and
the
apparition
of
the
unfortunate
suicide
whether
guilty
or
innocent
and
the
judgment
day
can
alone
determine
that
has
never
been
seen
since
case
xv
the
white
lady
of
rownam
avenue
near
stirling
like
most
european
countries
scotland
claims
its
share
of
phantasms
in
the
form
of
white
ladies
according
to
ingram
in
his
houses
and
family
the
ruins
of
the
mansion
of
woodhouselee
are
haunted
by
a
woman
in
white
presumably
though
personally
i
think
otherwise
the
ghost
of
lady
hamilton
of
bothwellhaugh
this
unfortunate
lady
together
with
her
baby
was
during
the
temporary
absence
of
her
husband
stripped
naked
and
turned
out
of
doors
on
a
bitterly
cold
night
by
a
favourite
of
the
regent
murray
as
a
result
of
this
inhuman
conduct
the
child
died
and
its
mother
with
the
corpse
in
her
arms
was
discovered
in
the
morning
raving
mad
another
instance
of
this
particular
form
of
apparition
is
to
be
found
in
sir
walter
scott
white
lady
of
avenel
and
there
are
endless
others
both
in
reality
and
fiction
some
years
ago
when
i
was
putting
up
at
a
friend
house
in
edinburgh
i
was
introduced
to
a
man
who
had
had
several
experiences
with
ghosts
and
had
therefore
been
especially
asked
to
meet
me
after
we
had
talked
together
for
some
time
he
related
the
following
adventure
which
had
befallen
him
in
his
childhood
in
rownam
avenue
the
seat
of
sir
near
stirling
i
was
always
a
lover
of
nature
he
began
and
my
earliest
reminiscences
are
associated
with
solitary
rambles
through
the
fields
dells
and
copses
surrounding
my
home
i
lived
within
a
of
the
property
of
old
sir
who
has
long
gone
to
rest
god
bless
his
soul
and
i
think
it
needs
blessing
for
if
there
was
any
truth
in
local
gossip
and
it
is
said
i
think
truly
that
there
is
never
any
smoke
without
fire
he
had
lived
a
very
queer
life
indeed
he
was
held
in
such
universal
awe
and
abhorrence
that
we
used
to
fly
at
his
approach
and
never
spoke
of
him
amongst
ourselves
saving
in
such
terms
as
auld
dour
crab
or
the
laird
deil
rownam
manor
house
where
he
lived
was
a
fine
specimen
of
architecture
and
had
it
been
called
a
castle
would
have
merited
the
appellation
far
more
than
many
of
the
buildings
in
scotland
that
bear
that
name
it
was
approached
by
a
long
avenue
of
trees
gigantic
elms
oaks
and
beeches
that
uniting
their
branches
overhead
in
summertime
formed
an
effectual
barrier
to
the
sun
rays
this
avenue
had
an
irresistible
attraction
for
me
it
literally
swarmed
with
rabbits
and
squirrels
and
many
are
the
times
i
have
trespassed
there
to
watch
them
i
had
a
very
secure
in
the
hollow
of
an
old
oak
where
i
have
often
been
secreted
while
sir
and
his
keepers
without
casting
a
glance
in
my
direction
passed
unsuspectingly
by
vowing
all
sorts
of
vengeance
against
trespassers
of
course
i
had
to
be
very
careful
how
i
got
there
for
the
grounds
were
well
patrolled
and
sir
had
sworn
to
prosecute
anyone
he
caught
walking
in
them
without
his
permission
had
sir
caught
me
i
should
doubtless
have
been
treated
with
the
utmost
severity
since
he
and
my
father
were
the
most
bitter
opponents
politically
and
for
that
reason
unreasonable
though
it
be
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
insulting
one
another
my
father
a
strong
radical
was
opposed
to
all
big
landed
proprietors
and
consequently
winked
his
eye
at
my
trespassings
but
i
think
nothing
would
really
have
pleased
him
better
than
to
have
seen
me
brought
to
book
by
sir
since
in
my
defence
he
would
have
had
an
opportunity
of
appealing
to
the
passions
of
the
local
people
who
were
all
radicals
and
of
incensing
them
still
further
against
the
principles
of
feudalism
but
to
continue
i
had
often
heard
it
rumoured
in
the
village
that
rownam
avenue
was
haunted
and
that
the
apparition
was
a
lady
in
white
and
no
other
than
sir
wife
whose
death
at
a
very
early
age
had
been
hastened
if
not
entirely
accounted
for
by
her
harsh
treatment
whether
sir
was
really
as
black
as
he
was
painted
i
have
never
been
able
to
ascertain
the
intense
animosity
with
which
we
all
regarded
him
made
us
believe
anything
ill
of
him
and
we
were
quite
ready
to
attribute
all
the
alleged
hauntings
in
the
neighbourhood
to
his
past
misdeeds
i
believe
my
family
with
scarcely
an
exception
believed
in
ghosts
anyhow
the
subject
of
ghosts
was
so
often
discussed
in
my
hearing
that
i
became
possessed
of
an
ungovernable
curiosity
to
see
one
if
only
the
white
lady
would
appear
in
the
daytime
i
thought
i
should
have
no
difficulty
in
satisfying
this
curiosity
but
unfortunately
she
did
not
appear
till
night
in
fact
not
until
long
after
boys
of
my
age
had
been
ruthlessly
ordered
off
to
bed
i
did
not
quite
like
the
idea
of
stealing
out
of
the
house
at
dead
of
night
and
going
alone
to
see
the
ghost
so
i
suggested
to
my
schoolfellow
that
he
should
also
break
loose
one
night
and
accompany
me
to
rownam
to
see
the
white
lady
it
was
however
of
no
use
much
as
he
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
a
ghost
in
broad
daylight
it
was
quite
another
matter
at
night
to
say
nothing
of
running
the
risk
of
being
caught
trespassing
by
that
inveterate
enemy
sir
at
length
finding
that
neither
persuasion
bribery
nor
taunts
of
cowardice
had
any
effect
on
my
schoolfellow
who
could
not
decide
which
appearance
would
be
the
more
appalling
for
he
assured
me
i
should
be
certain
to
encounter
either
one
or
the
other
the
white
lady
or
the
laird
deil
i
gave
up
all
further
effort
to
induce
him
to
accompany
me
and
made
up
my
mind
to
go
to
rownam
avenue
alone
biding
my
opportunity
and
waiting
till
my
father
was
safely
out
of
the
way
on
a
visit
to
greenock
where
some
business
transaction
would
oblige
him
to
remain
for
some
days
i
climbed
out
of
my
bedroom
window
when
i
deemed
the
rest
of
the
household
to
be
sound
asleep
scudded
swiftly
across
the
fields
and
making
short
work
of
the
lofty
wall
that
formed
the
southernmost
boundary
of
the
rownam
estates
quickly
made
my
way
to
the
avenue
it
was
an
ideal
sunday
night
in
august
and
it
seemed
as
if
all
nature
participated
in
the
sabbath
abstraction
from
noise
and
work
hardly
a
sound
broke
the
exquisite
silence
of
the
woods
at
times
overcome
with
the
delightful
sensation
of
freedom
i
paused
and
raising
my
eyes
to
the
starry
heavens
drank
in
huge
draughts
of
the
pure
country
air
tainted
only
with
the
sweet
smell
of
newly
mown
hay
and
the
scent
of
summer
flowers
i
became
intoxicated
delirious
and
in
transports
of
joy
threw
myself
on
the
soft
mossy
ground
and
baring
my
throat
and
chest
bathed
myself
in
the
moonbeams
kisses
then
picking
myself
slowly
up
i
performed
the
maddest
capers
and
finally
sobering
down
continued
my
course
every
now
and
again
fancying
i
detected
the
stealthy
footsteps
of
a
keeper
i
hid
behind
a
tree
where
i
remained
till
i
was
quite
assured
i
had
been
mistaken
and
that
no
one
was
about
how
long
i
dallied
i
do
not
know
but
it
must
have
been
fully
one
before
i
arrived
at
the
outskirts
of
the
avenue
and
advancing
eagerly
ensconced
myself
in
my
favourite
sanctuary
the
hollow
oak
all
was
hushed
and
motionless
and
as
i
gazed
into
the
gloom
i
became
conscious
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
of
a
sensation
of
eeriness
the
arched
canopy
of
foliage
overhead
was
strongly
suggestive
of
a
funeral
pall
not
a
glimmer
of
moonlight
penetrated
through
it
and
all
beneath
seemed
to
me
to
be
buried
in
the
silence
and
blackness
of
the
grave
the
loneliness
got
on
my
nerves
at
first
i
grew
afraid
only
afraid
and
then
my
fears
turned
into
a
panic
a
wild
mad
panic
consisting
in
the
one
desire
to
get
where
there
were
human
beings
creatures
i
knew
and
understood
with
this
end
in
view
i
emerged
from
my
retreat
and
was
preparing
to
fly
through
the
wood
when
from
afar
off
there
suddenly
came
the
sound
of
a
voice
the
harsh
grating
voice
of
a
man
convinced
this
time
that
i
had
been
discovered
by
a
keeper
i
jumped
back
into
the
tree
and
swarming
up
the
inside
of
the
trunk
peeped
cautiously
out
what
i
saw
nearly
made
me
jump
out
of
my
skin
advancing
along
the
avenue
was
the
thing
i
had
always
longed
to
see
and
for
which
i
had
risked
so
much
the
mysterious
lady
in
white
a
ghost
an
actual
ghost
how
every
nerve
in
my
body
thrilled
with
excitement
and
my
heart
thumped
till
it
seemed
on
the
verge
of
bursting
through
my
ribs
the
lady
in
white
why
it
would
be
the
talk
of
the
whole
countryside
some
one
had
no
hearsay
evidence
seen
the
notorious
apparition
at
last
how
all
my
schoolfellows
would
envy
me
and
how
bitterly
they
would
chide
themselves
for
being
too
cowardly
to
accompany
me
i
looked
at
her
closely
and
noticed
that
she
was
entirely
luminous
emitting
a
strong
phosphorescent
glow
like
the
glow
of
a
saving
that
it
was
in
a
perpetual
state
of
motion
she
wore
a
quantity
of
white
drapery
swathed
round
her
in
a
manner
that
perplexed
me
sorely
until
i
suddenly
realised
with
a
creeping
of
my
flesh
that
it
must
be
a
that
burial
accessary
so
often
minutely
described
to
me
by
the
son
of
the
village
undertaker
though
interesting
i
did
not
think
it
at
all
becoming
and
would
have
preferred
to
see
any
other
style
of
garment
streaming
over
her
neck
and
shoulders
were
thick
masses
of
long
wavy
golden
hair
which
was
ruffled
but
only
slightly
ruffled
by
the
gentle
summer
breeze
her
face
though
terrifying
by
reason
of
its
unearthly
pallor
was
so
beautiful
that
had
not
some
restraining
influence
compelled
me
to
remain
in
hiding
i
would
have
descended
from
my
perch
to
obtain
a
nearer
view
of
it
indeed
i
only
once
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
full
face
for
with
a
persistence
that
was
most
annoying
she
kept
it
turned
from
me
but
in
that
brief
second
the
lustre
of
her
long
blue
eyes
won
my
very
soul
and
boy
as
i
was
i
felt
like
the
hero
in
song
that
i
would
for
my
bonnie
ghost
in
very
deed
lay
me
doon
and
dee
her
eyes
are
still
firmly
impressed
on
my
memory
i
shall
never
forget
them
any
more
than
i
shall
forget
the
dainty
curves
of
her
full
red
lips
and
the
snowy
whiteness
of
her
perfect
teeth
nothing
i
thought
either
on
earth
or
in
heaven
could
have
been
half
so
lovely
and
i
was
so
enraptured
that
it
was
not
until
she
was
directly
beneath
me
that
i
perceived
she
was
not
alone
that
walking
by
her
side
with
one
arm
round
her
waist
his
face
and
figure
illuminated
with
the
light
from
her
body
was
sir
but
how
changed
gone
were
the
deep
black
scowl
the
savage
tightening
of
the
jaws
and
the
intensely
disagreeable
expression
that
had
earned
for
him
the
nickname
of
the
laird
deil
and
in
their
stead
i
saw
nothing
but
blind
infatuated
love
for
which
no
words
can
find
an
adequate
description
throwing
discretion
to
the
wind
for
my
excitement
and
curiosity
had
risen
to
the
highest
pitch
i
now
thrust
more
than
half
my
body
out
of
the
hole
in
the
trunk
the
next
instant
with
a
cry
of
dismay
i
pitched
head
first
on
to
the
ground
it
would
seem
that
boys
like
cats
can
not
in
ordinary
circumstances
be
killed
and
instead
of
breaking
my
neck
i
merely
suffered
that
most
immaterial
injury
immaterial
at
least
in
my
case
a
temporary
disendowment
of
the
senses
on
regaining
the
few
wits
i
could
lay
claim
to
i
fully
expected
to
find
myself
in
the
hands
of
the
irate
laird
who
would
seize
me
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
belabour
me
to
pieces
consequently
too
frightened
to
move
i
lay
absolutely
still
with
my
eyes
shut
but
as
the
minutes
glided
by
and
nothing
happened
i
picked
myself
up
all
was
quiet
and
pitch
dark
not
a
vestige
of
the
lady
in
white
not
a
vestige
of
sir
it
did
not
take
me
very
long
to
get
out
of
the
wood
and
home
i
ran
all
the
way
and
as
it
was
still
early
far
too
early
for
any
of
the
household
to
be
astir
i
crept
up
to
my
bedroom
unobserved
but
not
to
sleep
oh
dear
me
no
not
to
sleep
for
the
moment
i
blew
the
candle
out
and
got
into
bed
reaction
set
in
and
i
suffered
agonies
of
fear
when
i
went
to
school
in
the
morning
my
equilibrium
restored
and
bubbling
over
with
excitement
to
tell
the
boys
what
had
happened
i
received
another
shock
before
i
could
ejaculate
a
word
of
my
experiences
i
was
told
told
with
a
roar
and
shout
that
almost
broke
the
drum
of
my
ears
that
the
auld
laird
deil
was
dead
his
body
had
been
found
stretched
on
the
ground
a
few
feet
from
the
hollow
oak
in
the
avenue
shortly
after
sunrise
he
had
died
from
syncope
so
the
doctor
said
that
had
probably
been
caused
by
a
shock
some
severe
mental
shock
i
did
not
tell
my
companions
of
my
night
adventure
after
all
my
eagerness
to
do
so
had
departed
when
i
heard
of
the
auld
laird
death
case
xvi
the
ghost
of
the
hindoo
child
or
the
hauntings
of
the
white
dove
hotel
near
swithin
street
aberdeen
in
the
course
of
many
years
investigation
of
haunted
houses
i
have
naturally
come
in
contact
with
numerous
people
who
have
had
experiences
with
the
occult
nurse
mackenzie
is
one
of
these
people
i
met
her
for
the
first
time
last
year
at
the
house
of
my
old
friend
colonel
malcolmson
whose
wife
she
was
nursing
for
some
days
i
was
hardly
aware
she
was
in
the
house
the
illness
of
her
patient
keeping
her
in
constant
seclusion
but
when
malcolmson
grew
better
i
not
infrequently
saw
her
taking
a
morning
constitutional
in
the
beautiful
castle
grounds
it
was
on
one
of
these
occasions
that
she
favoured
me
with
an
account
of
her
psychical
adventure
it
happened
she
began
shortly
after
i
had
finished
my
term
as
probationer
at
hospital
edinburgh
a
letter
was
received
at
the
hospital
one
morning
with
the
urgent
request
that
two
nurses
should
be
sent
to
a
serious
case
near
swithin
street
as
the
letter
was
signed
by
a
physician
in
the
town
it
received
immediate
attention
and
nurse
emmett
and
i
were
dispatched
as
day
and
night
nurses
respectively
to
the
scene
of
action
my
hours
on
duty
were
from
till
the
house
in
which
the
patient
was
located
was
the
white
dove
hotel
a
thoroughly
respectable
and
establishment
the
proprietor
knew
nothing
about
the
invalid
except
that
her
name
was
vining
and
that
she
had
at
one
period
of
her
career
been
an
actress
he
had
noticed
that
she
had
looked
ill
on
her
arrival
the
previous
week
two
days
after
her
arrival
she
had
complained
of
feeling
very
ill
and
the
doctor
who
had
been
summoned
to
attend
her
said
that
she
was
suffering
from
a
very
loathsome
oriental
disease
which
fortunately
is
in
this
country
rare
the
hotel
though
newly
decorated
and
equipped
throughout
with
every
convenience
was
in
reality
very
old
it
was
one
of
those
delightfully
roomy
erections
that
seem
built
for
eternity
rather
than
time
and
for
comfort
rather
than
economy
of
space
the
interior
with
its
walls
polished
oak
floors
and
low
ceilings
traversed
with
ponderous
oaken
beams
also
impressed
me
pleasantly
whilst
a
flight
of
broad
oak
stairs
fenced
with
balustrades
a
foot
thick
brought
me
to
a
seemingly
interminable
corridor
into
which
the
door
of
miss
vining
room
opened
it
was
a
low
wainscoted
apartment
and
its
window
revealing
the
thickness
of
the
wall
looked
out
upon
a
dismal
yard
littered
with
brooms
and
buckets
opposite
the
foot
of
the
bed
a
modern
french
bedstead
by
the
bye
whose
brass
fittings
and
somewhat
flimsy
hangings
were
strangely
incongruous
with
their
venerable
surroundings
was
an
ingle
containing
the
smouldering
relics
of
what
had
doubtless
been
intended
for
a
fire
but
which
needed
considerable
coaxing
before
it
could
be
converted
from
a
pretence
to
a
reality
there
was
no
exit
save
by
the
doorway
i
had
entered
and
no
furniture
save
a
couple
of
chairs
and
a
table
strewn
with
an
untidy
medley
of
writing
materials
and
medicine
bottles
a
feeling
of
depression
contrasting
strangely
with
the
effect
produced
on
me
by
the
cheerfulness
of
the
hotel
in
general
seized
me
directly
i
entered
the
room
despite
the
brilliancy
of
the
electric
light
and
the
new
and
gaudy
the
air
was
full
of
gloom
a
gloom
which
for
the
very
reason
that
it
was
unaccountable
was
the
more
alarming
i
felt
it
hanging
around
me
like
the
undeveloped
shadow
of
something
singularly
hideous
and
repulsive
and
on
my
approaching
the
sick
woman
it
seemed
to
thrust
itself
in
my
way
and
force
me
back
miss
vining
was
decidedly
she
had
the
typically
theatrical
features
neatly
moulded
nose
and
chin
curly
yellow
hair
and
big
dreamy
blue
eyes
that
especially
appeal
to
a
certain
class
of
men
like
most
women
however
i
prefer
something
more
solid
both
physically
and
intellectually
i
can
not
stand
the
pretty
pretty
she
was
of
course
far
too
ill
to
converse
and
beyond
a
few
desultory
and
spasmodic
ejaculations
maintained
a
rigid
silence
as
there
was
no
occasion
for
me
to
sit
close
beside
her
i
drew
up
a
chair
before
the
fire
placing
myself
in
such
a
position
as
to
command
a
full
view
of
the
bed
my
first
night
passed
undisturbed
by
any
incident
and
in
the
morning
the
condition
of
my
patient
showed
a
slight
improvement
it
was
eight
in
the
evening
when
i
came
on
duty
again
and
the
weather
having
changed
during
the
day
the
whole
room
echoed
and
with
the
howling
of
the
wind
which
was
raging
round
the
house
with
demoniacal
fury
i
had
been
at
my
post
for
a
little
over
two
hours
and
had
just
registered
my
patient
temperature
when
happening
to
look
up
from
the
book
i
was
reading
i
saw
to
my
surprise
that
the
chair
beside
the
head
of
the
bed
was
occupied
by
a
child
a
tiny
girl
how
she
had
come
into
the
room
without
attracting
my
attention
was
certainly
extraordinary
and
i
could
only
suppose
that
the
shrieking
of
the
wind
down
the
wide
chimney
had
deadened
the
sound
of
the
door
and
her
footsteps
i
was
naturally
of
course
very
indignant
that
she
had
dared
to
come
in
without
rapping
and
getting
up
from
my
seat
i
was
preparing
to
address
her
and
bid
her
go
when
she
lifted
a
wee
white
hand
and
motioned
me
back
i
obeyed
because
i
could
not
help
myself
her
action
was
accompanied
by
a
peculiar
an
unpleasantly
peculiar
expression
that
held
me
spellbound
and
without
exactly
knowing
why
i
stood
staring
at
her
and
trembling
as
her
face
was
turned
towards
the
patient
and
she
wore
moreover
a
very
hat
i
could
see
nothing
of
her
features
but
from
her
graceful
little
figure
and
dainty
limbs
i
gathered
that
she
was
probably
both
beautiful
and
aristocratic
her
dress
though
not
perhaps
of
the
richest
quality
was
certainly
far
from
shoddy
and
there
was
something
in
its
style
and
make
that
suggested
foreign
nationality
italy
or
spain
or
south
america
or
even
the
orient
the
probability
of
the
latter
being
strengthened
by
her
pose
which
was
full
of
the
ease
which
is
characteristic
of
the
east
i
was
so
taken
up
with
watching
her
that
i
forgot
all
about
my
patient
until
a
prolonged
sigh
from
the
bed
reminded
me
of
her
existence
with
an
effort
i
then
advanced
and
was
about
to
approach
the
bed
when
the
child
without
moving
her
head
motioned
me
back
and
again
i
was
helpless
the
vision
i
had
obtained
of
the
sick
woman
brief
though
it
was
filled
me
with
alarm
she
was
tossing
to
and
fro
on
the
blankets
and
breathing
in
the
most
agonised
manner
as
if
in
delirium
or
enthralled
by
some
particularly
dreadful
nightmare
her
condition
so
frightened
me
that
i
made
the
most
frantic
efforts
to
overcome
my
inertia
i
did
not
succeed
however
and
at
last
utterly
overcome
by
my
exertion
i
closed
my
eyes
when
i
opened
them
again
the
chair
by
the
bed
was
vacant
the
child
had
gone
a
tremendous
feeling
of
relief
surged
through
me
and
jumping
out
of
my
seat
i
hastened
to
the
bedside
my
patient
was
worse
the
fever
had
increased
and
she
was
delirious
i
took
her
temperature
it
was
i
now
sat
close
beside
her
and
my
presence
apparently
had
a
soothing
effect
she
speedily
grew
calmer
and
after
taking
her
medicine
gradually
sank
into
a
gentle
sleep
which
lasted
until
late
in
the
morning
when
i
left
her
she
had
altogether
recovered
from
the
relapse
i
of
course
told
the
doctor
of
the
child
visit
and
he
was
very
angry
whatever
happens
nurse
he
said
take
care
that
no
one
enters
the
room
the
patient
condition
is
far
too
critical
for
her
to
see
any
one
even
her
own
daughter
you
must
keep
the
door
locked
armed
with
this
mandate
i
went
on
duty
the
following
night
with
a
somewhat
lighter
heart
and
after
locking
the
door
once
again
sat
by
the
fire
during
the
day
there
had
been
a
heavy
fall
of
snow
the
wind
had
abated
and
the
streets
were
now
as
silent
as
the
grave
ten
eleven
and
twelve
struck
and
my
patient
slept
tranquilly
at
a
quarter
to
one
however
i
was
abruptly
roused
from
a
reverie
by
a
sob
a
sob
of
fear
and
agony
that
proceeded
from
the
bed
i
looked
and
there
there
seated
in
the
same
posture
as
on
the
previous
evening
was
the
child
i
sprang
to
my
feet
with
an
exclamation
of
amazement
she
raised
her
hand
and
as
before
i
collapsed
spellbound
paralysed
no
words
of
mine
can
convey
all
the
sensations
i
experienced
as
i
sat
there
forced
to
listen
to
the
moaning
and
groaning
of
the
woman
whose
fate
had
been
entrusted
to
my
keeping
every
second
she
grew
worse
and
each
sound
rang
in
my
ears
like
the
hammering
of
nails
in
her
coffin
how
long
i
endured
such
torment
i
can
not
say
i
dare
not
think
for
though
the
clock
was
within
a
few
feet
of
me
i
never
once
thought
of
looking
at
it
at
last
the
child
rose
and
moving
slowly
from
the
bed
advanced
with
bowed
head
towards
the
window
the
spell
was
broken
with
a
cry
of
indignation
i
literally
bounded
over
the
carpet
and
faced
the
intruder
who
are
you
i
hissed
tell
me
your
name
instantly
how
dare
you
enter
this
room
without
my
permission
as
i
spoke
she
slowly
raised
her
head
i
snatched
at
her
hat
it
melted
away
in
my
hands
and
to
my
unspeakable
terror
my
undying
terror
i
looked
into
the
face
of
a
corpse
the
corpse
of
a
hindoo
child
with
a
big
gaping
cut
in
its
throat
in
its
lifetime
the
child
had
without
doubt
been
lovely
it
was
now
horrible
horrible
with
all
the
ghastly
disfigurements
the
repellent
disfigurements
of
a
long
consignment
to
the
grave
i
fainted
and
on
recovering
found
my
ghostly
visitor
had
vanished
and
that
my
patient
was
dead
one
of
her
hands
was
thrown
across
her
eyes
as
if
to
shut
out
some
object
on
which
she
feared
to
look
whilst
the
other
grasped
the
counterpane
convulsively
it
fell
to
my
duty
to
help
pack
up
her
belongings
and
among
her
letters
was
a
large
envelope
bearing
the
postmark
quetta
as
we
were
on
the
for
some
clue
as
to
the
address
of
her
relatives
i
opened
it
it
was
merely
the
photograph
of
a
hindoo
child
but
i
recognised
the
dress
immediately
it
was
that
of
my
ghostly
visitor
on
the
back
of
it
were
these
words
natalie
may
god
forgive
us
both
though
we
made
careful
inquiries
for
any
information
as
to
natalie
and
miss
vining
in
quetta
and
advertised
freely
in
the
leading
london
papers
we
learned
nothing
and
in
time
we
were
forced
to
let
the
matter
drop
as
far
as
i
know
the
ghost
of
the
hindoo
child
has
never
been
seen
again
but
i
have
heard
that
the
hotel
is
still
haunted
haunted
by
a
woman
case
xvii
glamis
castle
of
all
the
hauntings
in
scotland
none
has
gained
such
widespread
notoriety
as
the
hauntings
of
glamis
castle
the
seat
of
the
earl
of
strathmore
and
kinghorne
in
forfarshire
part
of
the
castle
that
part
which
is
the
more
frequently
haunted
is
of
ancient
though
uncertain
date
and
if
there
is
any
truth
in
the
tradition
that
duncan
was
murdered
there
by
macbeth
must
at
any
rate
have
been
in
existence
at
the
commencement
of
the
eleventh
century
of
course
extra
buildings
have
from
time
to
time
been
added
and
renovations
made
but
the
original
structure
remains
pretty
nearly
the
same
as
it
always
has
been
and
is
included
in
a
square
tower
that
occupies
a
central
position
and
commands
a
complete
view
of
the
entire
castle
within
this
tower
the
walls
of
which
are
fifteen
feet
thick
there
is
a
room
hidden
in
some
unsuspected
quarter
that
contains
a
secret
the
keynote
to
one
at
least
of
the
hauntings
which
is
known
only
to
the
earl
his
heir
on
the
attainment
of
his
birthday
and
the
factor
of
the
estate
in
all
probability
the
mystery
attached
to
this
room
would
challenge
but
little
attention
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
unearthly
noises
which
at
the
time
were
supposed
to
proceed
from
this
chamber
have
been
heard
by
various
visitors
sleeping
in
the
square
tower
the
following
experience
is
said
to
have
happened
to
a
lady
named
bond
i
append
it
more
or
less
in
her
own
words
it
is
a
good
many
years
since
i
stayed
at
glamis
i
was
in
fact
but
little
more
than
a
child
and
had
only
just
gone
through
my
first
season
in
town
but
though
young
i
was
neither
nervous
nor
imaginative
i
was
inclined
to
be
what
is
termed
stolid
that
is
to
say
extremely
and
practical
indeed
when
my
friends
exclaimed
you
do
mean
to
say
you
are
going
to
stay
at
glamis
do
you
know
it
haunted
i
burst
out
laughing
haunted
i
said
how
ridiculous
there
are
no
such
things
as
ghosts
one
might
as
well
believe
in
fairies
of
course
i
did
not
go
to
glamis
alone
my
mother
and
sister
were
with
me
but
whereas
they
slept
in
the
more
modern
part
of
the
castle
i
was
at
my
own
request
apportioned
a
room
in
the
square
tower
i
can
not
say
that
my
choice
had
anything
to
do
with
the
secret
chamber
that
and
the
alleged
mystery
had
been
dinned
into
my
ears
so
often
that
i
had
grown
thoroughly
sick
of
the
whole
thing
no
i
wanted
to
sleep
in
the
square
tower
for
quite
a
different
reason
a
reason
of
my
own
i
kept
an
aviary
the
tower
was
old
and
i
naturally
hoped
its
walls
would
be
covered
with
ivy
and
teeming
with
nests
some
of
which
i
might
be
able
to
reach
and
i
am
ashamed
to
say
plunder
from
my
window
alas
for
my
expectations
although
the
square
tower
was
so
ancient
that
in
some
places
it
was
actually
crumbling
away
not
the
sign
of
a
leaf
not
the
vestige
of
a
bird
nest
could
i
see
anywhere
the
walls
were
abominably
brutally
bare
however
it
was
not
long
before
my
disappointment
gave
way
to
delight
for
the
air
that
blew
in
through
the
open
window
was
so
sweet
so
richly
scented
with
heather
and
honeysuckle
and
the
view
of
the
broad
sweeping
thickly
wooded
grounds
so
indescribably
charming
that
despite
my
inartistic
and
unpoetical
nature
i
was
entranced
entranced
as
i
had
never
been
before
and
never
have
been
since
ghosts
i
said
to
myself
ghosts
how
absurd
how
preposterously
absurd
such
an
adorable
spot
as
this
can
only
harbour
sunshine
and
flowers
i
well
remember
too
for
as
i
have
already
said
i
was
not
poetical
how
much
i
enjoyed
my
first
dinner
at
glamis
the
long
journey
and
keen
mountain
air
had
made
me
hungry
and
i
thought
i
had
never
tasted
such
delicious
food
such
ideal
salmon
from
the
esk
and
such
heavenly
fruit
but
i
must
tell
you
that
although
i
ate
heartily
as
a
healthy
girl
should
by
the
time
i
went
to
bed
i
had
thoroughly
digested
my
meal
and
was
in
fact
quite
ready
to
partake
of
a
few
oatmeal
biscuits
i
found
in
my
and
remembered
having
bought
at
perth
it
was
about
eleven
when
my
maid
left
me
and
i
sat
for
some
minutes
wrapped
in
my
dressing
gown
before
the
open
window
the
night
was
very
still
and
save
for
an
occasional
rustle
of
the
wind
in
the
distant
the
hooting
of
an
owl
the
melancholy
cry
of
a
peewit
and
the
hoarse
barking
of
a
dog
the
silence
was
undisturbed
the
interior
of
my
room
was
in
nearly
every
particular
modern
the
furniture
was
not
old
there
were
no
grim
carvings
no
tapestries
on
the
walls
no
dark
cupboards
no
gloomy
corners
all
was
cosy
and
cheerful
and
when
i
got
into
bed
no
thought
of
bogle
or
mystery
entered
my
mind
in
a
few
minutes
i
was
asleep
and
for
some
time
there
was
nothing
but
a
blank
a
blank
in
which
all
identity
was
annihilated
then
suddenly
i
found
myself
in
an
room
with
a
lofty
ceiling
and
a
window
situated
at
so
great
a
distance
from
the
black
oaken
floor
as
to
be
altogether
inaccessible
from
within
feeble
gleams
of
phosphorescent
light
made
their
way
through
the
narrow
panes
and
served
to
render
distinct
the
more
prominent
objects
around
but
my
eyes
struggled
in
vain
to
reach
the
remoter
angles
of
the
wall
one
of
which
inspired
me
with
terror
such
as
i
had
never
felt
before
the
walls
were
covered
with
heavy
draperies
that
were
sufficient
in
themselves
to
preclude
the
possibility
of
any
save
the
loudest
of
sounds
penetrating
without
the
furniture
if
such
one
could
call
it
puzzled
me
it
seemed
more
fitted
for
the
cell
of
a
prison
or
lunatic
asylum
or
even
for
a
kennel
than
for
an
ordinary
i
could
see
no
chair
only
a
coarse
deal
table
a
straw
mattress
and
a
kind
of
trough
an
air
of
irredeemable
gloom
and
horror
hung
over
and
pervaded
everything
as
i
stood
there
i
felt
i
was
waiting
for
something
something
that
was
concealed
in
the
corner
of
the
room
i
dreaded
i
tried
to
reason
with
myself
to
assure
myself
that
there
was
nothing
there
that
could
hurt
me
nothing
that
could
even
terrify
me
but
my
efforts
were
in
vain
my
fears
grew
had
i
had
some
definite
knowledge
as
to
the
cause
of
my
alarm
i
should
not
have
suffered
so
much
but
it
was
my
ignorance
of
what
was
there
of
what
i
feared
that
made
my
terror
so
poignant
each
second
saw
the
agony
of
my
suspense
increase
i
dared
not
move
i
hardly
dare
breathe
and
i
dreaded
lest
the
violent
pulsation
of
my
heart
should
attract
the
attention
of
the
unknown
presence
and
precipitate
its
coming
out
yet
despite
the
perturbation
of
my
mind
i
caught
myself
analysing
my
feelings
it
was
not
danger
i
abhorred
so
much
as
its
absolute
effect
fright
i
shuddered
at
the
bare
thought
of
what
result
the
most
trivial
incident
the
creaking
of
a
board
ticking
of
a
beetle
or
hooting
of
an
owl
might
have
on
the
intolerable
agitation
of
my
soul
in
this
unnerved
and
pitiable
condition
i
felt
that
the
period
was
bound
to
come
sooner
or
later
when
i
should
have
to
abandon
life
and
reason
together
in
the
most
desperate
of
struggles
with
fear
at
length
something
moved
an
icy
chill
ran
through
my
frame
and
the
horror
of
my
anticipations
immediately
reached
its
culminating
point
the
presence
was
about
to
reveal
itself
the
gentle
rubbing
of
a
soft
body
on
the
floor
the
crack
of
a
bony
joint
breathing
another
crack
and
then
was
it
my
own
excited
imagination
or
the
disturbing
influence
of
the
atmosphere
or
the
uncertain
twilight
of
the
chamber
that
produced
before
me
in
the
stygian
darkness
of
the
recess
the
vacillating
and
indistinct
outline
of
something
luminous
and
horrid
i
would
gladly
have
risked
futurity
to
have
looked
elsewhere
i
could
not
my
eyes
were
fixed
i
was
compelled
to
gaze
steadily
in
front
of
me
slowly
very
slowly
the
thing
whatever
it
was
took
shape
legs
crooked
misshapen
human
legs
a
body
tawny
and
hunched
arms
long
and
spidery
with
crooked
knotted
fingers
a
head
large
and
bestial
and
covered
with
a
tangled
mass
of
grey
hair
that
hung
around
its
protruding
forehead
and
pointed
ears
in
ghastly
mockery
of
curls
a
face
and
herein
was
the
realisation
of
all
my
direst
expectations
a
face
white
and
staring
piglike
in
formation
malevolent
in
expression
a
hellish
combination
of
all
things
foul
and
animal
and
yet
withal
not
without
a
touch
of
pathos
as
i
stared
at
it
aghast
it
reared
itself
on
its
haunches
after
the
manner
of
an
ape
and
leered
piteously
at
me
then
shuffling
forward
it
rolled
over
and
lay
sprawled
out
like
some
ungainly
turtle
and
wallowed
as
for
warmth
in
the
cold
grey
beams
of
early
dawn
at
this
juncture
the
handle
of
the
chamber
door
turned
some
one
entered
there
was
a
loud
cry
and
i
awoke
awoke
to
find
the
whole
tower
walls
and
rafters
ringing
with
the
most
appalling
screams
i
have
ever
heard
screams
of
some
thing
or
of
some
one
for
there
was
in
them
a
strong
element
of
what
was
human
as
well
as
animal
in
the
greatest
distress
wondering
what
it
meant
and
more
than
ever
terrified
i
sat
up
in
bed
and
listened
listened
whilst
a
conviction
the
result
of
intuition
suggestion
or
what
you
will
but
a
conviction
all
the
same
forced
me
to
associate
the
sounds
with
the
thing
in
my
dream
and
i
associate
them
still
it
was
i
think
in
the
same
year
in
the
year
that
the
foregoing
account
was
narrated
to
me
that
i
heard
another
story
of
the
hauntings
at
glamis
a
story
in
connection
with
a
lady
whom
i
will
call
miss
macginney
i
append
her
experience
as
nearly
as
possible
as
she
is
stated
to
have
told
it
i
seldom
talk
about
my
adventure
miss
maginney
announced
because
so
many
people
ridicule
the
superphysical
and
laugh
at
the
mere
mention
of
ghosts
i
own
i
did
the
same
myself
till
i
stayed
at
glamis
but
a
week
there
quite
cured
me
of
scepticism
and
i
came
away
a
confirmed
believer
the
incident
occurred
nearly
twenty
years
ago
shortly
after
my
return
from
india
where
my
father
was
then
stationed
it
was
years
since
i
had
been
to
scotland
indeed
i
had
only
once
crossed
the
border
and
that
when
i
was
a
babe
consequently
i
was
delighted
to
receive
an
invitation
to
spend
a
few
weeks
in
the
land
of
my
birth
i
went
to
edinburgh
first
i
was
born
in
drumsheugh
gardens
and
thence
to
glamis
it
was
late
in
the
autumn
the
weather
was
intensely
cold
and
i
arrived
at
the
castle
in
a
blizzard
indeed
i
do
not
recollect
ever
having
been
out
in
such
a
frightful
storm
it
was
as
much
as
the
horses
could
do
to
make
headway
and
when
we
reached
the
castle
we
found
a
crowd
of
anxious
faces
eagerly
awaiting
us
in
the
hall
chilled
i
was
chilled
to
the
bone
and
thought
i
never
should
thaw
but
the
huge
fires
and
bright
and
cosy
atmosphere
of
the
rooms
for
the
interior
of
glamis
was
modernised
throughout
soon
set
me
right
and
by
tea
time
i
felt
nicely
warm
and
comfortable
my
bedroom
was
in
the
oldest
part
of
the
castle
the
square
tower
but
although
i
had
been
warned
by
some
of
the
guests
that
it
might
be
haunted
i
can
assure
you
that
when
i
went
to
bed
no
subject
was
farther
from
my
thoughts
than
the
subject
of
ghosts
i
returned
to
my
room
at
about
eleven
the
storm
was
then
at
its
height
all
was
babel
and
confusion
impenetrable
darkness
mingled
with
the
wildest
roaring
and
shrieking
and
when
i
peeped
through
my
casement
window
i
could
see
nothing
the
panes
were
shrouded
in
snow
snow
which
was
incessantly
dashed
against
them
with
cyclonic
fury
i
fixed
a
comb
in
the
so
as
not
to
be
kept
awake
by
the
constant
jarring
and
with
the
caution
characteristic
of
my
sex
looked
into
the
wardrobe
and
under
the
bed
for
burglars
though
heaven
knows
what
i
should
have
done
had
i
found
one
there
placed
a
candlestick
and
matchbox
on
the
table
by
my
bedside
lest
the
roof
or
window
should
be
blown
in
during
the
night
or
any
other
catastrophe
happen
and
after
all
these
preparations
got
into
bed
at
this
period
of
my
life
i
was
a
sound
sleeper
and
being
somewhat
unusually
tired
after
my
journey
i
was
soon
in
a
dreamless
slumber
what
awoke
me
i
can
not
say
but
i
came
to
myself
with
a
violent
start
such
as
might
have
been
occasioned
by
a
loud
noise
indeed
that
was
at
first
my
impression
and
i
strained
my
ears
to
try
and
ascertain
the
cause
of
it
all
was
however
silent
the
storm
had
abated
and
the
castle
and
grounds
were
wrapped
in
an
almost
preternatural
hush
the
sky
had
cleared
and
the
room
was
partially
illuminated
by
a
broad
stream
of
silvery
light
that
filtered
softly
in
through
the
white
and
tightly
drawn
blinds
a
feeling
that
there
was
something
unnatural
in
the
air
that
the
stillness
was
but
the
prelude
to
some
strange
and
startling
event
gradually
came
over
me
i
strove
to
reason
with
myself
to
argue
that
the
feeling
was
wholly
due
to
the
novelty
of
my
surroundings
but
my
efforts
were
fruitless
and
soon
there
stole
upon
me
a
sensation
to
which
i
had
been
hitherto
an
utter
stranger
i
became
afraid
an
irrepressible
tremor
pervaded
my
frame
my
teeth
chattered
my
blood
froze
obeying
an
impulse
an
impulse
i
could
not
resist
i
lifted
myself
up
from
the
pillows
and
peering
fearfully
into
the
shadowy
glow
that
lay
directly
in
front
of
me
listened
why
i
listened
i
do
not
know
saving
that
an
instinctive
spirit
prompted
me
at
first
i
could
hear
nothing
and
then
from
a
direction
i
could
not
define
there
came
a
noise
low
distinct
uninterpretative
it
was
repeated
in
rapid
succession
and
speedily
construed
itself
into
the
sound
of
mailed
footsteps
racing
up
the
long
flight
of
stairs
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
leading
to
my
room
dreading
to
think
what
it
might
be
and
seized
with
a
wild
sentiment
of
i
made
frantic
endeavours
to
get
out
of
bed
and
barricade
my
door
my
limbs
however
refused
to
move
i
was
paralysed
nearer
and
nearer
drew
the
sounds
and
i
could
at
length
distinguish
with
a
clearness
that
petrified
my
very
soul
the
banging
and
clanging
of
sword
scabbards
and
the
panting
and
gasping
of
men
sore
pressed
in
a
wild
and
desperate
race
and
then
the
meaning
of
it
all
came
to
me
with
hideous
abruptness
it
was
a
case
of
pursued
and
pursuing
the
race
was
for
life
outside
my
door
the
fugitive
halted
and
from
the
noise
he
made
in
trying
to
draw
his
breath
i
knew
he
was
dead
beat
his
antagonist
however
gave
him
but
scant
time
for
recovery
bounding
at
him
with
prodigious
leaps
he
struck
him
a
blow
that
sent
him
reeling
with
such
tremendous
force
against
the
door
that
the
panels
although
composed
of
the
stoutest
oak
quivered
and
strained
like
flimsy
matchboard
the
blow
was
repeated
the
cry
that
rose
in
the
victim
throat
was
converted
into
an
abortive
gurgling
groan
and
i
heard
the
ponderous
carve
its
way
through
helmet
bone
and
brain
a
moment
later
came
the
sound
of
slithering
armour
and
the
corpse
slipping
sideways
toppled
to
the
ground
with
a
sonorous
clang
a
silence
too
awful
for
words
now
ensued
having
finished
his
hideous
handiwork
the
murderer
was
quietly
deliberating
what
to
do
next
whilst
my
dread
of
attracting
his
attention
was
so
great
that
i
scarcely
dare
breathe
this
intolerable
state
of
things
had
already
lasted
for
what
seemed
to
me
a
lifetime
when
glancing
involuntarily
at
the
floor
i
saw
a
stream
of
fluid
lazily
lapping
its
way
to
me
from
the
direction
of
the
door
another
moment
and
it
would
reach
my
shoes
in
my
dismay
i
shrieked
aloud
there
was
a
sudden
stir
without
a
significant
clatter
of
steel
and
the
next
moment
despite
the
fact
that
it
was
locked
the
door
slowly
opened
the
limits
of
my
endurance
had
now
happily
been
reached
the
valves
of
my
heart
could
stand
no
more
i
fainted
on
my
awakening
to
consciousness
it
was
morning
and
the
welcome
sun
rays
revealed
no
evidences
of
the
distressing
drama
i
own
i
had
a
hard
tussle
before
i
could
make
up
my
mind
to
spend
another
night
in
that
room
and
my
feelings
as
i
shut
the
door
on
my
retreating
maid
and
prepared
to
get
into
bed
were
not
the
most
enviable
but
nothing
happened
nor
did
i
again
experience
anything
of
the
sort
till
the
evening
before
i
left
i
had
lain
down
all
the
afternoon
for
i
was
tired
after
a
long
morning
tramp
on
the
moors
a
thing
i
dearly
love
and
i
was
thinking
it
was
about
time
to
get
up
when
a
dark
shadow
suddenly
fell
across
my
face
i
looked
up
hastily
and
there
standing
by
my
bedside
and
bending
over
me
was
a
gigantic
figure
in
bright
armour
its
visor
was
up
and
what
i
saw
within
the
casque
is
stamped
for
ever
on
my
memory
it
was
the
face
of
the
dead
the
long
since
dead
with
the
expression
the
subtly
hellish
expression
of
the
living
as
i
gazed
helplessly
at
it
it
bent
lower
i
threw
up
my
hands
to
ward
it
off
there
was
a
loud
rap
at
the
door
and
as
my
maid
softly
entered
to
tell
me
tea
was
ready
it
vanished
the
third
account
of
the
glamis
hauntings
was
told
me
as
long
ago
as
the
summer
of
i
was
travelling
by
rail
from
perth
to
glasgow
and
the
only
other
occupant
of
my
compartment
was
an
elderly
gentleman
who
from
his
general
air
and
appearance
might
have
been
a
dominie
or
member
of
some
other
learned
profession
i
can
see
him
in
my
mind
eye
now
a
tall
thin
man
with
a
premature
stoop
he
had
white
hair
which
was
brushed
forward
on
either
side
of
his
head
in
such
a
manner
as
suggested
a
wig
bushy
eyebrows
dark
piercing
eyes
and
a
stern
though
somewhat
sad
mouth
his
features
were
fine
and
scholarly
he
was
there
was
something
about
him
something
that
marked
him
from
the
general
horde
something
that
attracted
me
and
i
began
chatting
with
him
soon
after
we
left
perth
in
the
course
of
a
conversation
that
was
at
all
events
interesting
to
me
i
adroitly
managed
to
introduce
the
subject
of
ghosts
then
as
ever
uppermost
in
my
thoughts
well
he
said
i
can
tell
you
of
something
rather
extraordinary
that
my
mother
used
to
say
happened
to
a
friend
of
hers
at
glamis
i
have
no
doubt
you
are
well
acquainted
with
the
hackneyed
stories
in
connection
with
the
hauntings
at
the
castle
for
example
earl
beardie
playing
cards
with
the
devil
and
the
weeping
woman
without
hands
or
tongue
you
can
read
about
them
in
scores
of
books
and
magazines
but
what
befel
my
mother
friend
whom
i
will
call
gibbons
for
i
have
forgotten
her
proper
name
was
apparently
of
a
novel
nature
the
affair
happened
shortly
before
gibbons
died
and
i
always
thought
that
what
took
place
might
have
been
in
some
way
connected
with
her
death
she
had
driven
over
to
the
castle
one
day
during
the
absence
of
the
owner
to
see
her
cousin
who
was
in
the
employ
of
the
earl
and
countess
never
having
been
at
glamis
before
but
having
heard
so
much
about
it
gibbons
was
not
a
little
curious
to
see
that
part
of
the
building
called
the
square
tower
that
bore
the
reputation
of
being
haunted
tactfully
biding
an
opportunity
she
sounded
her
relative
on
the
subject
and
was
laughingly
informed
that
she
might
go
anywhere
about
the
place
she
pleased
saving
to
one
spot
namely
chamber
and
there
she
could
certainly
never
succeed
in
poking
her
nose
as
its
locality
was
known
only
to
three
people
all
of
whom
were
pledged
never
to
reveal
it
at
the
commencement
of
her
tour
of
inspection
gibbons
was
disappointed
she
was
disappointed
in
the
tower
she
had
expected
to
see
a
gaunt
grim
place
crumbling
to
pieces
with
age
full
of
spiral
staircases
and
deep
dark
dungeons
whereas
everything
was
the
reverse
the
walls
were
in
an
excellent
state
of
preservation
absolutely
intact
the
rooms
bright
and
cheerful
and
equipped
in
the
most
modern
style
there
were
no
dungeons
at
least
none
on
view
and
the
passages
and
staircases
were
suggestive
of
nothing
more
alarming
than
bats
she
was
accompanied
for
some
time
by
her
relative
but
on
the
latter
being
called
away
gibbons
continued
her
rambles
alone
she
had
explored
the
lower
premises
and
was
leisurely
examining
a
handsomely
furnished
apartment
on
the
top
floor
when
in
crossing
from
one
side
of
the
room
to
the
other
she
ran
into
something
she
looked
down
nothing
was
to
be
seen
amazed
beyond
description
she
thrust
out
her
hands
and
they
alighted
on
an
object
which
she
had
little
difficulty
in
identifying
it
was
an
enormous
cask
or
barrel
lying
in
a
horizontal
position
she
bent
down
close
to
where
she
felt
it
but
she
could
see
nothing
nothing
but
the
boards
of
the
floor
to
make
sure
again
that
the
barrel
was
there
she
gave
a
little
kick
and
drew
back
her
foot
with
a
cry
of
pain
she
was
not
afraid
the
sunshine
in
the
room
forbade
fear
only
exasperated
she
was
certain
a
barrel
was
there
that
it
was
objective
and
she
was
angry
with
herself
for
not
seeing
it
she
wondered
if
she
were
going
blind
but
the
fact
that
other
objects
in
the
room
were
plainly
visible
to
her
discountenanced
such
an
idea
for
some
minutes
she
poked
and
jabbed
at
the
thing
and
then
seized
with
a
sudden
and
uncontrollable
panic
she
turned
round
and
fled
and
as
she
tore
out
of
the
room
along
the
passage
and
down
the
seemingly
interminable
flight
of
stairs
she
heard
the
barrel
behind
her
in
close
bump
bump
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
gibbons
met
her
cousin
and
as
she
clutched
the
latter
for
support
the
barrel
shot
past
her
still
continuing
its
descent
bump
bump
bump
though
the
steps
as
far
as
she
could
see
had
ended
till
the
sounds
gradually
dwindled
away
in
the
far
distance
whilst
the
manifestations
lasted
neither
gibbons
nor
her
cousin
spoke
but
the
latter
as
soon
as
the
sounds
had
ceased
dragged
gibbons
away
and
in
a
voice
shaking
with
terror
cried
quick
quick
do
for
heaven
sake
look
round
worse
has
yet
to
come
and
pulling
gibbons
along
in
breathless
haste
she
unceremoniously
hustled
her
out
of
the
tower
that
was
no
barrel
gibbons
cousin
subsequently
remarked
by
way
of
explanation
i
saw
it
i
have
seen
it
before
do
ask
me
to
describe
it
i
dare
not
i
dare
not
even
think
of
it
whenever
it
appears
a
certain
thing
happens
shortly
afterwards
do
do
on
any
account
say
a
word
about
it
to
any
one
here
and
gibbons
my
mother
told
me
came
away
from
glamis
a
thousand
times
more
curious
than
she
was
when
she
went
the
last
story
i
have
to
relate
is
one
i
heard
many
years
ago
when
i
was
staying
near
balmoral
a
gentleman
named
vance
with
strong
antiquarian
tastes
was
staying
at
an
inn
near
the
strathmore
estate
and
roaming
abroad
one
afternoon
in
a
fit
of
entered
the
castle
grounds
it
so
happened
fortunately
for
him
that
the
family
were
away
and
he
encountered
no
one
more
formidable
than
a
man
he
took
to
be
a
gardener
an
fellow
with
a
huge
head
covered
with
a
mass
of
red
hair
features
and
high
high
even
for
a
scot
struck
with
the
appearance
of
the
individual
vance
spoke
and
finding
him
wonderfully
civil
asked
whether
by
any
chance
he
ever
came
across
any
fossils
when
digging
in
the
gardens
i
dinna
ken
the
meaning
of
fossils
the
man
replied
what
are
they
vance
explained
and
a
look
of
cunning
gradually
pervaded
the
fellow
features
no
he
said
i
never
found
any
of
those
things
but
if
you
give
me
your
word
to
say
nothing
about
it
show
you
something
i
once
dug
up
over
yonder
by
the
square
tower
do
you
mean
the
haunted
tower
the
tower
that
is
supposed
to
contain
the
secret
room
vance
exclaimed
an
extraordinary
expression
an
expression
such
as
vance
found
it
impossible
to
analyse
came
into
the
man
eyes
yes
that
it
he
nodded
what
people
call
and
rightly
call
the
haunted
tower
i
got
it
from
there
but
do
you
say
naught
about
it
vance
whose
curiosity
was
roused
promised
and
the
man
politely
requesting
him
to
follow
led
the
way
to
a
cottage
that
stood
near
by
in
the
heart
of
a
gloomy
wood
to
vance
astonishment
the
treasure
proved
to
be
the
skeleton
of
a
hand
a
hand
with
abnormally
large
knuckles
and
the
first
joint
of
both
fingers
and
thumb
much
shorter
than
the
others
it
was
the
most
extraordinarily
shaped
hand
vance
had
ever
seen
and
he
did
not
know
in
the
least
how
to
classify
it
it
repelled
yet
interested
him
and
he
eventually
offered
the
man
a
good
sum
to
allow
him
to
keep
it
to
his
astonishment
the
money
was
refused
you
may
have
the
thing
and
welcome
the
fellow
said
only
i
advise
you
not
to
look
at
it
late
at
night
or
just
before
getting
into
bed
if
you
do
you
may
have
bad
dreams
i
will
take
my
chance
of
that
vance
laughed
you
see
being
a
cockney
i
am
not
superstitious
it
is
only
you
highlanders
and
your
first
cousins
the
irish
who
believe
nowadays
in
bogles
omens
and
and
packing
the
hand
carefully
in
his
knapsack
vance
bid
the
creature
good
morning
and
went
on
his
way
for
the
rest
of
the
day
the
hand
was
uppermost
in
his
thoughts
nothing
had
ever
fascinated
him
so
much
he
sat
pondering
over
it
the
whole
evening
and
bedtime
found
him
still
examining
it
examining
it
upstairs
in
his
room
by
candlelight
he
had
a
hazy
recollection
that
some
clock
had
struck
twelve
and
he
was
beginning
to
feel
that
it
was
about
time
to
retire
when
in
the
mirror
opposite
him
he
caught
sight
of
the
door
it
was
open
by
jove
that
odd
he
said
to
himself
i
could
have
sworn
i
shut
and
bolted
it
to
make
sure
he
turned
round
the
door
was
closed
an
optical
delusion
he
murmured
i
will
try
again
he
looked
into
the
mirror
the
door
reflected
in
it
was
open
utterly
at
a
loss
to
know
how
to
explain
the
phenomenon
he
leaned
forward
in
his
seat
to
examine
the
glass
more
carefully
and
as
he
did
so
he
gave
a
start
on
the
threshold
of
the
doorway
was
a
shadow
black
and
bulbous
a
cold
shiver
ran
down
vance
spine
and
just
for
a
moment
he
felt
afraid
terribly
afraid
but
he
quickly
composed
himself
it
was
nothing
but
an
illusion
there
was
no
shadow
there
in
reality
he
had
only
to
turn
round
and
the
thing
would
be
gone
it
was
amusing
entertaining
he
would
wait
and
see
what
happened
the
shadow
moved
it
moved
slowly
through
the
air
like
some
huge
spider
or
bird
he
would
not
acknowledge
that
there
was
anything
sinister
about
it
only
something
droll
excruciatingly
droll
yet
it
did
not
make
him
laugh
when
it
had
drawn
a
little
nearer
he
tried
to
diagnose
it
to
discover
its
material
counterpart
in
one
of
the
objects
around
him
but
he
was
obliged
to
acknowledge
his
attempts
were
failures
there
was
nothing
in
the
room
in
the
least
degree
like
it
a
vague
feeling
of
uneasiness
gradually
crept
over
him
was
the
thing
the
shadow
of
something
with
which
he
was
familiar
but
could
not
just
then
recall
to
mind
something
he
feared
something
that
was
sinister
he
struggled
against
the
idea
he
dismissed
it
as
absurd
but
it
returned
returned
and
took
deeper
root
as
the
shadow
drew
nearer
he
wished
the
house
was
not
quite
so
silent
that
he
could
hear
some
indication
of
life
anything
anything
for
companionship
and
to
rid
him
of
the
oppressive
the
very
oppressive
sense
of
loneliness
and
isolation
again
a
thrill
of
terror
ran
through
him
look
here
he
exclaimed
aloud
glad
to
hear
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
look
here
if
this
goes
on
much
longer
i
shall
begin
to
think
i
going
mad
i
have
had
enough
and
more
than
enough
of
magic
mirrors
for
one
night
it
high
time
i
got
into
bed
he
strove
to
rise
from
his
chair
to
move
he
was
unable
to
do
either
some
strange
tyrannical
force
held
him
a
prisoner
a
change
now
took
place
in
the
shadow
the
blurr
dissipated
and
the
clearly
defined
outlines
of
an
object
an
object
that
made
vance
perfectly
sick
with
apprehension
slowly
disclosed
themselves
his
suspicions
were
verified
it
was
the
hand
the
hand
no
longer
skeleton
but
covered
with
green
mouldering
flesh
feeling
its
way
slyly
and
stealthily
towards
him
towards
the
back
of
his
chair
he
noted
the
murderous
twitching
of
its
short
flat
the
monstrous
muscles
of
its
hideous
thumb
and
the
great
clumsy
hollows
of
its
clammy
palm
it
closed
in
upon
him
its
cold
slimy
detestable
skin
touched
his
coat
his
shoulder
his
neck
his
head
it
pressed
him
down
squashed
suffocated
him
he
saw
it
all
in
the
glass
and
then
an
extraordinary
thing
happened
vance
suddenly
became
animated
he
got
up
and
peeped
furtively
round
chairs
bed
wardrobe
had
all
disappeared
so
had
the
bedroom
and
he
found
himself
in
a
small
bare
comfortless
queerly
constructed
apartment
without
a
door
and
with
only
a
narrow
slit
of
a
window
somewhere
near
the
ceiling
he
had
in
one
of
his
hands
a
knife
with
a
long
keen
blade
and
his
whole
mind
was
bent
on
murder
creeping
stealthily
forward
he
approached
a
corner
of
the
room
where
he
now
saw
for
the
first
time
a
mattress
a
mattress
on
which
lay
a
form
what
the
thing
was
whether
human
or
animal
vance
did
not
know
did
not
care
all
he
felt
was
that
it
was
there
for
him
to
kill
that
he
loathed
and
hated
it
hated
it
with
a
hatred
such
as
nothing
else
could
have
produced
tiptoeing
gently
up
to
it
he
bent
down
and
lifting
his
knife
high
above
his
head
plunged
it
into
the
body
with
all
the
force
he
could
command
he
recrossed
the
room
and
found
himself
once
more
in
his
apartment
at
the
inn
he
looked
for
the
skeleton
hand
it
was
not
where
he
had
left
it
it
had
vanished
then
he
glanced
at
the
mirror
and
on
its
brilliantly
polished
surface
saw
not
his
own
face
but
the
face
of
the
gardener
the
man
who
had
given
him
the
hand
features
colour
hair
all
all
were
identical
wonderfully
hideously
identical
and
as
the
eyes
met
his
they
smiled
devilishly
early
the
next
day
vance
set
out
for
the
spinney
and
cottage
they
were
not
to
be
found
nobody
had
ever
heard
of
them
he
continued
his
travels
and
some
months
later
at
a
loan
collection
of
pictures
in
a
gallery
in
edinburgh
he
came
to
an
abrupt
a
very
abrupt
halt
before
the
portrait
of
a
gentleman
in
ancient
costume
the
face
seemed
strangely
familiar
the
huge
head
with
thick
red
hair
the
features
the
thin
and
tightly
compressed
lips
then
in
a
trice
it
all
came
back
to
him
the
face
he
looked
at
was
that
of
the
uncouth
gardener
the
man
who
had
given
him
the
hand
and
to
clinch
the
matter
