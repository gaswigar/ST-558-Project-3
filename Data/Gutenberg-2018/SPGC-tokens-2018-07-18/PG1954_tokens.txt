colonel

hullo
there
is
that
old
again
this
exclamation
was
made
by
a
lawyer
s
clerk
of
the
class
called
in
french
offices
a
a
messenger
in
fact
who
at
this
moment
was
eating
a
piece
of
dry
bread
with
a
hearty
appetite
he
pulled
off
a
morsel
of
crumb
to
make
into
a
bullet
and
fired
it
gleefully
through
the
open
pane
of
the
window
against
which
he
was
leaning
the
pellet
well
aimed
rebounded
almost
as
high
as
the
window
after
hitting
the
hat
of
a
stranger
who
was
crossing
the
courtyard
of
a
house
in
the
rue
vivienne
where
dwelt
maitre
derville
come
simonnin
don
t
play
tricks
on
people
or
i
will
turn
you
out
of
doors
however
poor
a
client
may
be
he
is
still
a
man
hang
it
all
said
the
head
clerk
pausing
in
the
addition
of
a
bill
of
costs
the
lawyer
s
messenger
is
commonly
as
was
simonnin
a
lad
of
thirteen
or
fourteen
who
in
every
office
is
under
the
special
jurisdiction
of
the
managing
clerk
whose
errands
and
keep
him
employed
on
his
way
to
carry
writs
to
the
bailiffs
and
petitions
to
the
courts
he
is
akin
to
the
street
boy
in
his
habits
and
to
the
pettifogger
by
fate
the
boy
is
almost
always
ruthless
unbroken
unmanageable
a
ribald
rhymester
impudent
greedy
and
idle
and
yet
almost
all
these
clerklings
have
an
old
mother
lodging
on
some
fifth
floor
with
whom
they
share
their
pittance
of
thirty
or
forty
francs
a
month
if
he
is
a
man
why
do
you
call
him
old
asked
simonnin
with
the
air
of
a
schoolboy
who
has
caught
out
his
master
and
he
went
on
eating
his
bread
and
cheese
leaning
his
shoulder
against
the
window
jamb
for
he
rested
standing
like
a
one
of
his
legs
raised
and
propped
against
the
other
on
the
toe
of
his
shoe
what
trick
can
we
play
that
cove
said
the
third
clerk
whose
name
was
godeschal
in
a
low
voice
pausing
in
the
middle
of
a
discourse
he
was
extemporizing
in
an
appeal
engrossed
by
the
fourth
clerk
of
which
copies
were
being
made
by
two
neophytes
from
the
provinces
then
he
went
on
improvising
in
his
noble
and
beneficent
wisdom
his
majesty
louis
the
write
it
at
full
length
heh
desroches
the
learned
you
as
you
engross
it
he
resumed
the
reins
of
government
what
did
that
old
nincompoop
ever
understand
high
mission
to
which
he
had
been
called
by
divine
providence
a
note
of
admiration
and
six
stops
they
are
pious
enough
at
the
courts
to
let
us
put
six
his
first
thought
as
is
proved
by
the
date
of
the
order
hereinafter
designated
was
to
repair
the
misfortunes
caused
by
the
terrible
and
sad
disasters
of
the
revolutionary
times
by
restoring
to
his
numerous
and
faithful
numerous
is
flattering
and
ought
to
please
the
bench
their
unsold
estates
whether
within
our
realm
or
in
conquered
or
acquired
territory
or
in
the
endowments
of
public
institutions
for
we
are
and
proclaim
ourselves
competent
to
declare
that
this
is
the
spirit
and
meaning
of
the
famous
truly
loyal
order
given
stop
said
godeschal
to
the
three
copying
clerks
that
rascally
sentence
brings
me
to
the
end
of
my
well
he
went
on
wetting
the
back
fold
of
the
sheet
with
his
tongue
so
as
to
be
able
to
fold
back
the
page
of
thick
stamped
paper
well
if
you
want
to
play
him
a
trick
tell
him
that
the
master
can
only
see
his
clients
between
two
and
three
in
the
morning
we
shall
see
if
he
comes
the
old
ruffian
and
godeschal
took
up
the
sentence
he
was
dictating
are
you
ready
yes
cried
the
three
writers
it
all
went
all
together
the
appeal
the
gossip
and
the
conspiracy
here
daddy
boucard
what
is
the
date
of
the
order
we
must
dot
our
s
and
cross
our
s
by
jingo
it
helps
to
fill
the
by
jingo
repeated
one
of
the
copying
clerks
before
boucard
the
head
clerk
could
reply
what
have
you
written
cried
godeschal
looking
at
one
of
the
novices
with
an
expression
at
once
stern
and
humorous
why
yes
said
desroches
the
fourth
clerk
leaning
across
his
neighbor
s
copy
he
has
written
must
dot
our
i
and
spelt
it
all
the
clerks
shouted
with
laughter
why
monsieur
hure
you
take
by
jingo
for
a
law
term
and
you
say
you
come
from
mortagne
exclaimed
simonnin
scratch
it
cleanly
out
said
the
head
clerk
if
the
judge
whose
business
it
is
to
tax
the
bill
were
to
see
such
things
he
would
say
you
were
laughing
at
the
whole
boiling
you
would
hear
of
it
from
the
chief
come
no
more
of
this
nonsense
monsieur
hure
a
norman
ought
not
to
write
out
an
appeal
without
thought
it
is
the
shoulder
arms
of
the
in
asked
tell
me
when
june
replied
the
head
clerk
without
looking
up
from
his
work
a
knock
at
the
office
door
interrupted
the
circumlocutions
of
the
prolix
document
five
clerks
with
rows
of
hungry
teeth
bright
mocking
eyes
and
curly
heads
lifted
their
noses
towards
the
door
after
crying
all
together
in
a
singing
tone
come
in
boucard
kept
his
face
buried
in
a
pile
of
papers
odds
and
ends
in
french
law
jargon
and
went
on
drawing
out
the
bill
of
costs
on
which
he
was
busy
the
office
was
a
large
room
furnished
with
the
traditional
stool
which
is
to
be
seen
in
all
these
dens
of
the
crossed
the
room
diagonally
to
the
chimney
of
a
fireplace
on
the
marble
were
several
chunks
of
bread
triangles
of
brie
cheese
pork
cutlets
glasses
bottles
and
the
head
clerk
s
cup
of
chocolate
the
smell
of
these
dainties
blended
so
completely
with
that
of
the
immoderately
overheated
stove
and
the
odor
peculiar
to
offices
and
old
papers
that
the
trail
of
a
fox
would
not
have
been
perceptible
the
floor
was
covered
with
mud
and
snow
brought
in
by
the
clerks
near
the
window
stood
the
desk
with
a
revolving
lid
where
the
head
clerk
worked
and
against
the
back
of
it
was
the
second
clerk
s
table
the
second
clerk
was
at
this
moment
in
court
it
was
between
eight
and
nine
in
the
morning
the
only
decoration
of
the
office
consisted
in
huge
yellow
posters
announcing
seizures
of
real
estate
sales
settlements
under
trust
final
or
interim
judgments
all
the
glory
of
a
lawyer
s
office
behind
the
head
clerk
was
an
enormous
room
of
which
each
division
was
crammed
with
bundles
of
papers
with
an
infinite
number
of
tickets
hanging
from
them
at
the
ends
of
red
tape
which
give
a
peculiar
physiognomy
to
law
papers
the
lower
rows
were
filled
with
cardboard
boxes
yellow
with
use
on
which
might
be
read
the
names
of
the
more
important
clients
whose
cases
were
juicily
stewing
at
this
present
time
the
dirty
admitted
but
little
daylight
indeed
there
are
very
few
offices
in
paris
where
it
is
possible
to
write
without
lamplight
before
ten
in
the
morning
in
the
month
of
february
for
they
are
all
left
to
very
natural
neglect
every
one
comes
and
no
one
stays
no
one
has
any
personal
interest
in
a
scene
of
mere
routine
neither
the
attorney
nor
the
counsel
nor
the
clerks
trouble
themselves
about
the
appearance
of
a
place
which
to
the
youths
is
a
schoolroom
to
the
clients
a
passage
to
the
chief
a
laboratory
the
greasy
furniture
is
handed
down
to
successive
owners
with
such
scrupulous
care
that
in
some
offices
may
still
be
seen
boxes
of
machines
for
twisting
parchment
gut
and
bags
left
by
the
prosecuting
parties
of
the
chatelet
abbreviated
to
a
court
which
under
the
old
order
of
things
represented
the
present
court
of
first
instance
or
county
court
so
in
this
dark
office
thick
with
dust
there
was
as
in
all
its
fellows
something
repulsive
to
the
clients
something
which
made
it
one
of
the
most
hideous
monstrosities
of
paris
nay
were
it
not
for
the
mouldy
sacristies
where
prayers
are
weighed
out
and
paid
for
like
groceries
and
for
the
shops
where
flutter
the
rags
that
blight
all
the
illusions
of
life
by
showing
us
the
last
end
of
all
our
festivities
an
attorney
s
office
would
be
of
all
social
marts
the
most
loathsome
but
we
might
say
the
same
of
the
of
the
law
court
of
the
lottery
office
of
the
brothel
but
why
in
these
places
perhaps
the
drama
being
played
in
a
man
s
soul
makes
him
indifferent
to
accessories
which
would
also
account
for
the
of
great
thinkers
and
men
of
great
ambitions
where
is
my
penknife
i
am
eating
my
you
go
and
be
hanged
here
is
a
blot
on
the
silence
gentlemen
these
various
exclamations
were
uttered
simultaneously
at
the
moment
when
the
old
client
shut
the
door
with
the
sort
of
humility
which
disfigures
the
movements
of
a
man
down
on
his
luck
the
stranger
tried
to
smile
but
the
muscles
of
his
face
relaxed
as
he
vainly
looked
for
some
symptoms
of
amenity
on
the
inexorably
indifferent
faces
of
the
six
clerks
accustomed
no
doubt
to
gauge
men
he
very
politely
addressed
the
hoping
to
get
a
civil
answer
from
this
boy
of
all
work
monsieur
is
your
master
at
home
the
pert
messenger
made
no
reply
but
patted
his
ear
with
the
fingers
of
his
left
hand
as
much
as
to
say
i
am
what
do
you
want
sir
asked
godeschal
swallowing
as
he
spoke
a
mouthful
of
bread
big
enough
to
charge
a
flourishing
his
knife
and
crossing
his
legs
throwing
up
one
foot
in
the
air
to
the
level
of
his
eyes
this
is
the
fifth
time
i
have
called
replied
the
victim
i
wish
to
speak
to
on
business
yes
but
i
can
explain
it
to
no
one
but
m
derville
is
in
bed
if
you
wish
to
consult
him
on
some
difficulty
he
does
no
serious
work
till
midnight
but
if
you
will
lay
the
case
before
us
we
could
help
you
just
as
well
as
he
can
to
the
stranger
was
unmoved
he
looked
timidly
about
him
like
a
dog
who
has
got
into
a
strange
kitchen
and
expects
a
kick
by
grace
of
their
profession
lawyers
clerks
have
no
fear
of
thieves
they
did
not
suspect
the
owner
of
the
and
left
him
to
study
the
place
where
he
looked
in
vain
for
a
chair
to
sit
on
for
he
was
evidently
tired
attorneys
on
principle
do
not
have
many
chairs
in
their
offices
the
inferior
client
being
kept
waiting
on
his
feet
goes
away
grumbling
but
then
he
does
not
waste
time
which
as
an
old
lawyer
once
said
is
not
allowed
for
when
the
bill
is
taxed
monsieur
said
the
old
man
as
i
have
already
told
you
i
can
not
explain
my
business
to
any
one
but
derville
i
will
wait
till
he
is
boucard
had
finished
his
bill
he
smelt
the
fragrance
of
his
chocolate
rose
from
his
cane
armchair
went
to
the
looked
the
old
man
from
head
to
foot
stared
at
his
coat
and
made
an
indescribable
grimace
he
probably
reflected
that
whichever
way
his
client
might
be
wrung
it
would
be
impossible
to
squeeze
out
a
centime
so
he
put
in
a
few
brief
words
to
rid
the
office
of
a
bad
customer
it
is
the
truth
monsieur
the
chief
only
works
at
night
if
your
business
is
important
i
recommend
you
to
return
at
one
in
the
the
stranger
looked
at
the
head
clerk
with
a
bewildered
expression
and
remained
motionless
for
a
moment
the
clerks
accustomed
to
every
change
of
countenance
and
the
odd
whimsicalities
to
which
indecision
or
absence
of
mind
gives
rise
in
parties
went
on
eating
making
as
much
noise
with
their
jaws
as
horses
over
a
manger
and
paying
no
further
heed
to
the
old
man
i
will
come
again
said
the
stranger
at
length
with
the
tenacious
desire
peculiar
to
the
unfortunate
to
catch
humanity
at
fault
the
only
irony
allowed
to
poverty
is
to
drive
justice
and
benevolence
to
unjust
denials
when
a
poor
wretch
has
convicted
society
of
falsehood
he
throws
himself
more
eagerly
on
the
mercy
of
god
what
do
you
think
of
that
for
a
cracked
pot
said
simonnin
without
waiting
till
the
old
man
had
shut
the
door
he
looks
as
if
he
had
been
buried
and
dug
up
again
said
a
clerk
he
is
some
colonel
who
wants
his
arrears
of
pay
said
the
head
clerk
no
he
is
a
retired
concierge
said
godeschal
i
bet
you
he
is
a
nobleman
cried
boucard
i
bet
you
he
has
been
a
porter
retorted
godeschal
only
porters
are
gifted
by
nature
with
shabby
as
worn
and
greasy
and
frayed
as
that
old
body
s
and
did
you
see
his
boots
that
let
the
water
in
and
his
stock
which
serves
for
a
shirt
he
has
slept
in
a
dry
he
may
be
of
noble
birth
and
yet
have
pulled
the
doorlatch
cried
desroches
it
has
been
known
no
boucard
insisted
in
the
midst
of
laughter
i
maintain
that
he
was
a
brewer
in
and
a
colonel
in
the
time
of
the
i
bet
theatre
tickets
round
that
he
never
was
a
soldier
said
godeschal
done
with
you
answered
boucard
monsieur
monsieur
shouted
the
little
messenger
opening
the
window
what
are
you
at
now
simonnin
asked
boucard
i
am
calling
him
that
you
may
ask
him
whether
he
is
a
colonel
or
a
porter
he
must
all
the
clerks
laughed
as
to
the
old
man
he
was
already
coming
upstairs
again
what
can
we
say
to
him
cried
godeschal
leave
it
to
me
replied
boucard
the
poor
man
came
in
nervously
his
eyes
cast
down
perhaps
not
to
betray
how
hungry
he
was
by
looking
too
greedily
at
the
eatables
monsieur
said
boucard
will
you
have
the
kindness
to
leave
your
name
so
that
derville
may
know
the
colonel
who
was
killed
at
eylau
asked
hure
who
having
so
far
said
nothing
was
jealous
of
adding
a
jest
to
all
the
others
the
same
monsieur
replied
the
good
man
with
antique
simplicity
and
he
went
away
whew
done
brown
poof
oh
ah
boum
the
old
rogue
sold
again
monsieur
desroches
you
are
going
to
the
play
without
paying
said
hure
to
the
fourth
clerk
giving
him
a
slap
on
the
shoulder
that
might
have
killed
a
rhinoceros
there
was
a
storm
of
cries
and
exclamations
which
all
the
onomatopeia
of
the
language
would
fail
to
represent
which
theatre
shall
we
go
to
to
the
opera
cried
the
head
clerk
in
the
first
place
said
godeschal
i
never
mentioned
which
theatre
i
might
if
i
chose
take
you
to
see
madame
madame
saqui
is
not
the
what
is
a
play
replied
godeschal
first
we
must
define
the
point
of
fact
what
did
i
bet
gentlemen
a
play
what
is
a
play
a
spectacle
what
is
a
spectacle
something
to
be
seen
but
on
that
principle
you
would
pay
your
bet
by
taking
us
to
see
the
water
run
under
the
pont
neuf
cried
simonnin
interrupting
him
to
be
seen
for
money
godeschal
added
but
a
great
many
things
are
to
be
seen
for
money
that
are
not
plays
the
definition
is
defective
said
desroches
but
do
listen
to
me
you
are
talking
nonsense
my
dear
boy
said
boucard
is
curtius
a
play
said
godeschal
no
said
the
head
clerk
it
is
a
collection
of
figures
but
it
is
a
i
bet
you
a
hundred
francs
to
a
sou
godeschal
resumed
that
curtius
waxworks
forms
such
a
show
as
might
be
called
a
play
or
theatre
it
contains
a
thing
to
be
seen
at
various
prices
according
to
the
place
you
choose
to
and
so
on
and
so
forth
said
simonnin
you
mind
i
don
t
box
your
ears
said
godeschal
the
clerk
shrugged
their
shoulders
besides
it
is
not
proved
that
that
old
ape
was
not
making
game
of
us
he
said
dropping
his
argument
which
was
drowned
in
the
laughter
of
the
other
clerks
on
my
honor
colonel
chabert
is
really
and
truly
dead
his
wife
is
married
again
to
comte
ferraud
councillor
of
state
madame
ferraud
is
one
of
our
come
the
case
is
remanded
till
said
boucard
to
work
gentlemen
the
deuce
is
in
it
we
get
nothing
done
here
finish
copying
that
appeal
it
must
be
handed
in
before
the
sitting
of
the
fourth
chamber
judgment
is
to
be
given
come
on
you
go
if
he
really
were
colonel
chabert
would
not
that
impudent
rascal
simonnin
have
felt
the
leather
of
his
boot
in
the
right
place
when
he
pretended
to
be
deaf
said
desroches
regarding
this
remark
as
more
conclusive
than
godeschal
s
since
nothing
is
settled
said
boucard
let
us
all
agree
to
go
to
the
upper
boxes
of
the
francais
and
see
talma
in
simonnin
may
go
to
the
and
thereupon
the
head
clerk
sat
down
at
his
table
and
the
others
followed
his
example
in
june
eighteen
hundred
and
in
words
said
godeschal
ready
yes
replied
the
two
and
the
engrosser
whose
pens
forthwith
began
to
creak
over
the
stamped
paper
making
as
much
noise
in
the
office
as
a
hundred
cockchafers
imprisoned
by
schoolboys
in
paper
cages
we
hope
that
my
lords
on
the
the
extemporizing
clerk
went
on
stop
i
must
read
my
sentence
through
again
i
do
not
understand
it
that
must
often
happen
and
three
said
boucard
godeschal
began
again
after
reading
all
through
the
document
my
lords
on
the
bench
will
not
be
less
magnanimous
than
the
august
author
of
the
decree
and
that
they
will
do
justice
against
the
miserable
claims
of
the
acting
committee
of
the
chief
board
of
the
legion
of
honor
by
interpreting
the
law
in
the
wide
sense
we
have
here
set
monsieur
godeschal
wouldn
t
you
like
a
glass
of
water
said
the
little
messenger
that
imp
of
a
boy
said
boucard
here
get
on
your
take
this
packet
and
spin
off
to
the
set
godeschal
went
on
add
the
interest
of
madame
la
at
full
length
what
cried
the
chief
are
you
thinking
of
drawing
up
an
appeal
in
the
case
of
vicomtesse
de
grandlieu
against
the
legion
of
honor
a
case
for
the
office
to
stand
or
fall
by
you
are
something
like
an
ass
have
the
goodness
to
put
aside
your
copies
and
your
notes
you
may
keep
all
that
for
the
case
of
navarreins
against
the
hospitals
it
is
late
i
will
draw
up
a
little
petition
myself
with
a
due
allowance
of
inasmuch
and
go
to
the
courts
this
scene
is
typical
of
the
thousand
delights
which
when
we
look
back
on
our
youth
make
us
say
those
were
good
at
about
one
in
the
morning
colonel
chabert
knocked
at
the
door
of
maitre
derville
attorney
to
the
court
of
first
instance
in
the
department
of
the
seine
the
porter
told
him
that
monsieur
derville
had
not
yet
come
in
the
old
man
said
he
had
an
appointment
and
was
shown
upstairs
to
the
rooms
occupied
by
the
famous
lawyer
who
notwithstanding
his
youth
was
considered
to
have
one
of
the
longest
heads
in
paris
having
rung
the
distrustful
applicant
was
not
a
little
astonished
at
finding
the
head
clerk
busily
arranging
in
a
convenient
order
on
his
master
s
table
the
papers
relating
to
the
cases
to
be
tried
on
the
morrow
the
clerk
not
less
astonished
bowed
to
the
colonel
and
begged
him
to
take
a
seat
which
the
client
did
on
my
word
monsieur
i
thought
you
were
joking
yesterday
when
you
named
such
an
hour
for
an
interview
said
the
old
man
with
the
forced
mirth
of
a
ruined
man
who
does
his
best
to
smile
the
clerks
were
joking
but
they
were
speaking
the
truth
too
replied
the
man
going
on
with
his
work
m
derville
chooses
this
hour
for
studying
his
cases
taking
stock
of
their
possibilities
arranging
how
to
conduct
them
deciding
on
the
line
of
defence
his
prodigious
intellect
is
freer
at
this
hour
the
only
time
when
he
can
have
the
silence
and
quiet
needed
for
the
conception
of
good
ideas
since
he
entered
the
profession
you
are
the
third
person
to
come
to
him
for
a
consultation
at
this
midnight
hour
after
coming
in
the
chief
will
discuss
each
case
read
everything
spend
four
or
five
hours
perhaps
over
the
business
then
he
will
ring
for
me
and
explain
to
me
his
intentions
in
the
morning
from
ten
to
two
he
hears
what
his
clients
have
to
say
then
he
spends
the
rest
of
his
day
in
appointments
in
the
evening
he
goes
into
society
to
keep
up
his
connections
so
he
has
only
the
night
for
undermining
his
cases
ransacking
the
arsenal
of
the
code
and
laying
his
plan
of
battle
he
is
determined
never
to
lose
a
case
he
loves
his
art
he
will
not
undertake
every
case
as
his
brethren
do
that
is
his
life
an
exceptionally
active
one
and
he
makes
a
great
deal
of
as
he
listened
to
this
explanation
the
old
man
sat
silent
and
his
strange
face
assumed
an
expression
so
bereft
of
intelligence
that
the
clerk
after
looking
at
him
thought
no
more
about
him
a
few
minutes
later
derville
came
in
in
evening
dress
his
head
clerk
opened
the
door
to
him
and
went
back
to
finish
arranging
the
papers
the
young
lawyer
paused
for
a
moment
in
amazement
on
seeing
in
the
dim
light
the
strange
client
who
awaited
him
colonel
chabert
was
as
absolutely
immovable
as
one
of
the
wax
figures
in
curtius
collection
to
which
godeschal
had
proposed
to
treat
his
this
quiescence
would
not
have
been
a
subject
for
astonishment
if
it
had
not
completed
the
supernatural
aspect
of
the
man
s
whole
person
the
old
soldier
was
dry
and
lean
his
forehead
intentionally
hidden
under
a
smoothly
combed
wig
gave
him
a
look
of
mystery
his
eyes
seemed
shrouded
in
a
transparent
film
you
would
have
compared
them
to
dingy
with
a
blue
iridescence
changing
in
the
gleam
of
the
wax
lights
his
face
pale
livid
and
as
thin
as
a
knife
if
i
may
use
such
a
vulgar
expression
was
as
the
face
of
the
dead
round
his
neck
was
a
tight
black
silk
stock
below
the
dark
line
of
this
rag
the
body
was
so
completely
hidden
in
shadow
that
a
man
of
imagination
might
have
supposed
the
old
head
was
due
to
some
chance
play
of
light
and
shade
or
have
taken
it
for
a
portrait
by
rembrandt
without
a
frame
the
brim
of
the
hat
which
covered
the
old
man
s
brow
cast
a
black
line
of
shadow
on
the
upper
part
of
the
face
this
grotesque
effect
though
natural
threw
into
relief
by
contrast
the
white
furrows
the
cold
wrinkles
the
colorless
tone
of
the
countenance
and
the
absence
of
all
movement
in
the
figure
of
all
fire
in
the
eye
were
in
harmony
with
a
certain
look
of
melancholy
madness
and
the
deteriorating
symptoms
characteristic
of
senility
giving
the
face
an
indescribably
look
which
no
human
words
could
render
but
an
observer
especially
a
lawyer
could
also
have
read
in
this
stricken
man
the
signs
of
deep
sorrow
the
traces
of
grief
which
had
worn
into
this
face
as
drops
of
water
from
the
sky
falling
on
fine
marble
at
last
destroy
its
beauty
a
physician
an
author
or
a
judge
might
have
discerned
a
whole
drama
at
the
sight
of
its
sublime
horror
while
the
least
charm
was
its
resemblance
to
the
grotesques
which
artists
amuse
themselves
by
sketching
on
a
corner
of
the
lithographic
stone
while
chatting
with
a
friend
on
seeing
the
attorney
the
stranger
started
with
the
convulsive
thrill
that
comes
over
a
poet
when
a
sudden
noise
rouses
him
from
a
fruitful
reverie
in
silence
and
at
night
the
old
man
hastily
removed
his
hat
and
rose
to
bow
to
the
young
man
the
leather
lining
of
his
hat
was
doubtless
very
greasy
his
wig
stuck
to
it
without
his
noticing
it
and
left
his
head
bare
showing
his
skull
horribly
disfigured
by
a
scar
beginning
at
the
nape
of
the
neck
and
ending
over
the
right
eye
a
prominent
seam
all
across
his
head
the
sudden
removal
of
the
dirty
wig
which
the
poor
man
wore
to
hide
this
gash
gave
the
two
lawyers
no
inclination
to
laugh
so
horrible
to
behold
was
this
riven
skull
the
first
idea
suggested
by
the
sight
of
this
old
wound
was
his
intelligence
must
have
escaped
through
that
if
this
is
not
colonel
chabert
he
is
some
trooper
thought
boucard
monsieur
said
derville
to
whom
have
i
the
honor
of
speaking
to
colonel
which
he
who
was
killed
at
eylau
replied
the
old
man
on
hearing
this
strange
speech
the
lawyer
and
his
clerk
glanced
at
each
other
as
much
as
to
say
he
is
monsieur
the
colonel
went
on
i
wish
to
confide
to
you
the
secret
of
my
a
thing
worthy
of
note
is
the
natural
intrepidity
of
lawyers
whether
from
the
habit
of
receiving
a
great
many
persons
or
from
the
deep
sense
of
the
protection
conferred
on
them
by
the
law
or
from
confidence
in
their
missions
they
enter
everywhere
fearing
nothing
like
priests
and
physicians
derville
signed
to
boucard
who
vanished
during
the
day
sir
said
the
attorney
i
am
not
so
miserly
of
my
time
but
at
night
every
minute
is
precious
so
be
brief
and
concise
go
to
the
facts
without
digression
i
will
ask
for
any
explanations
i
may
consider
necessary
having
bid
his
strange
client
to
be
seated
the
young
man
sat
down
at
the
table
but
while
he
gave
his
attention
to
the
deceased
colonel
he
turned
over
the
bundles
of
papers
you
know
perhaps
said
the
dead
man
that
i
commanded
a
cavalry
regiment
at
eylau
i
was
of
important
service
to
the
success
of
murat
s
famous
charge
which
decided
the
victory
unhappily
for
me
my
death
is
a
historical
fact
recorded
in
et
where
it
is
related
in
full
detail
we
cut
through
the
three
russian
lines
which
at
once
closed
up
and
formed
again
so
that
we
had
to
repeat
the
movement
back
again
at
the
moment
when
we
were
nearing
the
emperor
after
having
scattered
the
russians
i
came
against
a
squadron
of
the
enemy
s
cavalry
i
rushed
at
the
obstinate
brutes
two
russian
officers
perfect
giants
attacked
me
both
at
once
one
of
them
gave
me
a
cut
across
the
head
that
crashed
through
everything
even
a
black
silk
cap
i
wore
next
my
head
and
cut
deep
into
the
skull
i
fell
from
my
horse
murat
came
up
to
support
me
he
rode
over
my
body
he
and
all
his
men
fifteen
hundred
of
them
there
might
have
been
more
my
death
was
announced
to
the
emperor
who
as
a
precaution
for
he
was
fond
of
me
was
the
master
wished
to
know
if
there
were
no
hope
of
saving
the
man
he
had
to
thank
for
such
a
vigorous
attack
he
sent
two
surgeons
to
identify
me
and
bring
me
into
hospital
saying
perhaps
too
carelessly
for
he
was
very
busy
go
and
see
whether
by
any
chance
poor
chabert
is
still
these
rascally
who
had
just
seen
me
lying
under
the
hoofs
of
the
horses
of
two
regiments
no
doubt
did
not
trouble
themselves
to
feel
my
pulse
and
reported
that
i
was
quite
dead
the
certificate
of
death
was
probably
made
out
in
accordance
with
the
rules
of
military
as
he
heard
his
visitor
express
himself
with
complete
lucidity
and
relate
a
story
so
probable
though
so
strange
the
young
lawyer
ceased
fingering
the
papers
rested
his
left
elbow
on
the
table
and
with
his
head
on
his
hand
looked
steadily
at
the
colonel
do
you
know
monsieur
that
i
am
lawyer
to
the
countess
ferraud
he
said
interrupting
the
speaker
colonel
chabert
s
widow
my
wife
yes
monsieur
therefore
after
a
hundred
fruitless
attempts
to
interest
lawyers
who
have
all
thought
me
mad
i
made
up
my
mind
to
come
to
you
i
will
tell
you
of
my
misfortunes
afterwards
for
the
present
allow
me
to
prove
the
facts
explaining
rather
how
things
must
have
fallen
out
rather
than
how
they
did
occur
certain
circumstances
known
i
suppose
to
no
one
but
the
almighty
compel
me
to
speak
of
some
things
as
hypothetical
the
wounds
i
had
received
must
presumably
have
produced
tetanus
or
have
thrown
me
into
a
state
analogous
to
that
of
a
disease
called
i
believe
catalepsy
otherwise
how
is
it
conceivable
that
i
should
have
been
stripped
as
is
the
custom
in
time
of
the
war
and
thrown
into
the
common
grave
by
the
men
ordered
to
bury
the
dead
allow
me
here
to
refer
to
a
detail
of
which
i
could
know
nothing
till
after
the
event
which
after
all
i
must
speak
of
as
my
death
at
stuttgart
in
i
met
an
old
quartermaster
of
my
regiment
this
dear
fellow
the
only
man
who
chose
to
recognize
me
and
of
whom
i
will
tell
you
more
later
explained
the
marvel
of
my
preservation
by
telling
me
that
my
horse
was
shot
in
the
flank
at
the
moment
when
i
was
wounded
man
and
beast
went
down
together
like
a
monk
cut
out
of
as
i
fell
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
i
was
no
doubt
covered
by
the
body
of
my
horse
which
protected
me
from
being
trampled
to
death
or
hit
by
a
ball
when
i
came
to
myself
monsieur
i
was
in
a
position
and
an
atmosphere
of
which
i
could
give
you
no
idea
if
i
talked
till
the
little
air
there
was
to
breathe
was
foul
i
wanted
to
move
and
found
no
room
i
opened
my
eyes
and
saw
nothing
the
most
alarming
circumstance
was
the
lack
of
air
and
this
enlightened
me
as
to
my
situation
i
understood
that
no
fresh
air
could
penetrate
to
me
and
that
i
must
die
this
thought
took
off
the
sense
of
intolerable
pain
which
had
aroused
me
there
was
a
violent
singing
in
my
ears
i
heard
or
i
thought
i
heard
i
will
assert
nothing
groans
from
the
world
of
dead
among
whom
i
was
lying
some
nights
i
still
think
i
hear
those
stifled
moans
though
the
remembrance
of
that
time
is
very
obscure
and
my
memory
very
indistinct
in
spite
of
my
impressions
of
far
more
acute
suffering
i
was
fated
to
go
through
and
which
have
confused
my
ideas
but
there
was
something
more
awful
than
cries
there
was
a
silence
such
as
i
have
never
known
elsewhere
literally
the
silence
of
the
grave
at
last
by
raising
my
hands
and
feeling
the
dead
i
discerned
a
vacant
space
between
my
head
and
the
human
carrion
above
i
could
thus
measure
the
space
granted
by
a
chance
of
which
i
knew
not
the
cause
it
would
seem
that
thanks
to
the
carelessness
and
the
haste
with
which
we
had
been
pitched
into
the
trench
two
dead
bodies
had
leaned
across
and
against
each
other
forming
an
angle
like
that
made
by
two
cards
when
a
child
is
building
a
card
castle
feeling
about
me
at
once
for
there
was
no
time
for
play
i
happily
felt
an
arm
lying
detached
the
arm
of
a
hercules
a
stout
bone
to
which
i
owed
my
rescue
but
for
this
help
i
must
have
perished
but
with
a
fury
you
may
imagine
i
began
to
work
my
way
through
the
bodies
which
separated
me
from
the
layer
of
earth
which
had
no
doubt
been
thrown
over
us
i
say
us
as
if
there
had
been
others
living
i
worked
with
a
will
monsieur
for
here
i
am
but
to
this
day
i
do
not
know
how
i
succeeded
in
getting
through
the
pile
of
flesh
which
formed
a
barrier
between
me
and
life
you
will
say
i
had
three
arms
this
crowbar
which
i
used
cleverly
enough
opened
out
a
little
air
between
the
bodies
i
moved
and
i
economized
my
breath
at
last
i
saw
daylight
but
through
snow
at
that
moment
i
perceived
that
my
head
was
cut
open
happily
my
blood
or
that
of
my
comrades
or
perhaps
the
torn
skin
of
my
horse
who
knows
had
in
coagulating
formed
a
sort
of
natural
plaster
but
in
spite
of
it
i
fainted
away
when
my
head
came
into
contact
with
the
snow
however
the
little
warmth
left
in
me
melted
the
snow
about
me
and
when
i
recovered
consciousness
i
found
myself
in
the
middle
of
a
round
hole
where
i
stood
shouting
as
long
as
i
could
but
the
sun
was
rising
so
i
had
very
little
chance
of
being
heard
was
there
any
one
in
the
fields
yet
i
pulled
myself
up
using
my
feet
as
a
spring
resting
on
one
of
the
dead
whose
ribs
were
firm
you
may
suppose
that
this
was
not
the
moment
for
saying
respect
courage
in
misfortune
in
short
monsieur
after
enduring
the
anguish
if
the
word
is
strong
enough
for
my
frenzy
of
seeing
for
a
long
time
yes
quite
a
long
time
those
cursed
germans
flying
from
a
voice
they
heard
where
they
could
see
no
one
i
was
dug
out
by
a
woman
who
was
brave
or
curious
enough
to
come
close
to
my
head
which
must
have
looked
as
though
it
had
sprouted
from
the
ground
like
a
mushroom
this
woman
went
to
fetch
her
husband
and
between
them
they
got
me
to
their
poor
hovel
it
would
seem
that
i
must
have
again
fallen
into
a
catalepsy
allow
me
to
use
the
word
to
describe
a
state
of
which
i
have
no
idea
but
which
from
the
account
given
by
my
hosts
i
suppose
to
have
been
the
effect
of
that
malady
i
remained
for
six
months
between
life
and
death
not
speaking
or
if
i
spoke
talking
in
delirium
at
last
my
hosts
got
me
admitted
to
the
hospital
at
heilsberg
you
will
understand
monsieur
that
i
came
out
of
the
womb
of
the
grave
as
naked
as
i
came
from
my
mother
s
so
that
six
months
afterwards
when
i
remembered
one
fine
morning
that
i
had
been
colonel
chabert
and
when
on
recovering
my
wits
i
tried
to
exact
from
my
nurse
rather
more
respect
than
she
paid
to
any
poor
devil
all
my
companions
in
the
ward
began
to
laugh
luckily
for
me
the
surgeon
out
of
professional
pride
had
answered
for
my
cure
and
was
naturally
interested
in
his
patient
when
i
told
him
coherently
about
my
former
life
this
good
man
named
sparchmann
signed
a
deposition
drawn
up
in
the
legal
form
of
his
country
giving
an
account
of
the
miraculous
way
in
which
i
had
escaped
from
the
trench
dug
for
the
dead
the
day
and
hour
when
i
had
been
found
by
my
benefactress
and
her
husband
the
nature
and
exact
spot
of
my
injuries
adding
to
these
documents
a
description
of
my
person
well
monsieur
i
have
neither
these
important
pieces
of
evidence
nor
the
declaration
i
made
before
a
notary
at
heilsberg
with
a
view
to
establishing
my
identity
from
the
day
when
i
was
turned
out
of
that
town
by
the
events
of
the
war
i
have
wandered
about
like
a
vagabond
begging
my
bread
treated
as
a
madman
when
i
have
told
my
story
without
ever
having
found
or
earned
a
sou
to
enable
me
to
recover
the
deeds
which
would
prove
my
statements
and
restore
me
to
society
my
sufferings
have
often
kept
me
for
six
months
at
a
time
in
some
little
town
where
every
care
was
taken
of
the
invalid
frenchman
but
where
he
was
laughed
at
to
his
face
as
soon
as
he
said
he
was
colonel
chabert
for
a
long
time
that
laughter
those
doubts
used
to
put
me
into
rages
which
did
me
harm
and
which
even
led
to
my
being
locked
up
at
stuttgart
as
a
madman
and
indeed
as
you
may
judge
from
my
story
there
was
ample
reason
for
shutting
a
man
up
at
the
end
of
two
years
detention
which
i
was
compelled
to
submit
to
after
hearing
my
keepers
say
a
thousand
times
here
is
a
poor
man
who
thinks
he
is
colonel
chabert
to
people
who
would
reply
poor
fellow
i
became
convinced
of
the
impossibility
of
my
own
adventure
i
grew
melancholy
resigned
and
quiet
and
gave
up
calling
myself
colonel
chabert
in
order
to
get
out
of
my
prison
and
see
france
once
more
oh
monsieur
to
see
paris
again
was
a
delirium
which
i
without
finishing
his
sentence
colonel
chabert
fell
into
a
deep
study
which
derville
respected
one
fine
day
his
visitor
resumed
one
spring
day
they
gave
me
the
key
of
the
fields
as
we
say
and
ten
thalers
admitting
that
i
talked
quite
sensibly
on
all
subjects
and
no
longer
called
myself
colonel
chabert
on
my
honor
at
that
time
and
even
to
this
day
sometimes
i
hate
my
name
i
wish
i
were
not
myself
the
sense
of
my
rights
kills
me
if
my
illness
had
but
deprived
me
of
all
memory
of
my
past
life
i
could
be
happy
i
should
have
entered
the
service
again
under
any
name
no
matter
what
and
should
perhaps
have
been
made
in
austria
or
russia
who
knows
monsieur
said
the
attorney
you
have
upset
all
my
ideas
i
feel
as
if
i
heard
you
in
a
dream
pause
for
a
moment
i
beg
of
you
are
the
only
person
said
the
colonel
with
a
melancholy
look
who
ever
listened
to
me
so
patiently
no
lawyer
has
been
willing
to
lend
me
ten
napoleons
to
enable
me
to
procure
from
germany
the
necessary
documents
to
begin
my
lawsuit
what
lawsuit
said
the
attorney
who
had
forgotten
his
client
s
painful
position
in
listening
to
the
narrative
of
his
past
sufferings
why
monsieur
is
not
the
comtesse
ferraud
my
wife
she
has
thirty
thousand
francs
a
year
which
belong
to
me
and
she
will
not
give
me
a
son
when
i
tell
lawyers
these
things
men
of
sense
when
i
propose
i
a
beggar
to
bring
action
against
a
count
and
countess
when
i
a
dead
man
bring
up
as
against
a
certificate
of
death
a
certificate
of
marriage
and
registers
of
births
they
show
me
out
either
with
the
air
of
cold
politeness
which
you
all
know
how
to
assume
to
rid
yourself
of
a
hapless
wretch
or
brutally
like
men
who
think
they
have
to
deal
with
a
swindler
or
a
madman
it
depends
on
their
nature
i
have
been
buried
under
the
dead
but
now
i
am
buried
under
the
living
under
papers
under
facts
under
the
whole
of
society
which
wants
to
shove
me
underground
again
pray
resume
your
narrative
said
derville
pray
resume
it
cried
the
hapless
old
man
taking
the
young
lawyer
s
hand
that
is
the
first
polite
word
i
have
heard
since
the
colonel
wept
gratitude
choked
his
voice
the
appealing
and
unutterable
eloquence
that
lies
in
the
eyes
in
a
gesture
even
in
silence
entirely
convinced
derville
and
touched
him
deeply
listen
monsieur
said
he
i
have
this
evening
won
three
hundred
francs
at
cards
i
may
very
well
lay
out
half
that
sum
in
making
a
man
happy
i
will
begin
the
inquiries
and
researches
necessary
to
obtain
the
documents
of
which
you
speak
and
until
they
arrive
i
will
give
you
five
francs
a
day
if
you
are
colonel
chabert
you
will
pardon
the
smallness
of
the
loan
as
it
is
coming
from
a
young
man
who
has
his
fortune
to
make
the
colonel
as
he
called
himself
sat
for
a
moment
motionless
and
bewildered
the
depth
of
his
woes
had
no
doubt
destroyed
his
powers
of
belief
though
he
was
eager
in
pursuit
of
his
military
distinction
of
his
fortune
of
himself
perhaps
it
was
in
obedience
to
the
inexplicable
feeling
the
latent
germ
in
every
man
s
heart
to
which
we
owe
the
experiments
of
alchemists
the
passion
for
glory
the
discoveries
of
astronomy
and
of
physics
everything
which
prompts
man
to
expand
his
being
by
multiplying
himself
through
deeds
or
ideas
in
his
mind
the
was
now
but
a
secondary
object
just
as
the
vanity
of
success
or
the
pleasures
of
winning
become
dearer
to
the
gambler
than
the
object
he
has
at
stake
the
young
lawyer
s
words
were
as
a
miracle
to
this
man
for
ten
years
repudiated
by
his
wife
by
justice
by
the
whole
social
creation
to
find
in
a
lawyer
s
office
the
ten
gold
pieces
which
had
so
long
been
refused
him
by
so
many
people
and
in
so
many
ways
the
colonel
was
like
the
lady
who
having
been
ill
of
a
fever
for
fifteen
years
fancied
she
had
some
fresh
complaint
when
she
was
cured
there
are
joys
in
which
we
have
ceased
to
believe
they
fall
on
us
it
is
like
a
thunderbolt
they
burn
us
the
poor
man
s
gratitude
was
too
great
to
find
utterance
to
superficial
observers
he
seemed
cold
but
derville
saw
complete
honesty
under
this
amazement
a
swindler
would
have
found
his
voice
where
was
i
said
the
colonel
with
the
simplicity
of
a
child
or
of
a
soldier
for
there
is
often
something
of
the
child
in
a
true
soldier
and
almost
always
something
of
the
soldier
in
a
child
especially
in
france
at
stuttgart
you
were
out
of
prison
said
derville
you
know
my
wife
asked
the
colonel
yes
said
derville
with
a
bow
what
is
she
like
still
quite
the
old
man
held
up
his
hand
and
seemed
to
be
swallowing
down
some
secret
anguish
with
the
grave
and
solemn
resignation
that
is
characteristic
of
men
who
have
stood
the
ordeal
of
blood
and
fire
on
the
battlefield
monsieur
said
he
with
a
sort
of
cheerfulness
for
he
breathed
again
the
poor
colonel
he
had
again
risen
from
the
grave
he
had
just
melted
a
covering
of
snow
less
easily
thawed
than
that
which
had
once
before
frozen
his
head
and
he
drew
a
deep
breath
as
if
he
had
just
escaped
from
a
dungeon
monsieur
if
i
had
been
a
handsome
young
fellow
none
of
my
misfortunes
would
have
befallen
me
women
believe
in
men
when
they
flavor
their
speeches
with
the
word
love
they
hurry
then
they
come
they
go
they
are
everywhere
at
once
they
intrigue
they
assert
facts
they
play
the
very
devil
for
a
man
who
takes
their
fancy
but
how
could
i
interest
a
woman
i
had
a
face
like
a
requiem
i
was
dressed
like
a
i
was
more
like
an
esquimaux
than
a
frenchman
i
who
had
formerly
been
considered
one
of
the
smartest
of
fops
in
i
chabert
count
of
the
empire
well
on
the
very
day
when
i
was
turned
out
into
the
streets
like
a
dog
i
met
the
quartermaster
of
whom
i
just
now
spoke
this
old
soldier
s
name
was
boutin
the
poor
devil
and
i
made
the
queerest
pair
of
hacks
i
ever
set
eyes
on
i
met
him
out
walking
but
though
i
recognized
him
he
could
not
possibly
guess
who
i
was
we
went
into
a
tavern
together
in
there
when
i
told
him
my
name
boutin
s
mouth
opened
from
ear
to
ear
in
a
roar
of
laughter
like
the
bursting
of
a
mortar
that
mirth
monsieur
was
one
of
the
keenest
pangs
i
have
known
it
told
me
without
disguise
how
great
were
the
changes
in
me
i
was
then
unrecognizable
even
to
the
humblest
and
most
grateful
of
my
former
friends
i
had
once
saved
boutin
s
life
but
it
was
only
the
repayment
of
a
debt
i
owed
him
i
need
not
tell
you
how
he
did
me
this
service
it
was
at
ravenna
in
italy
the
house
where
boutin
prevented
my
being
stabbed
was
not
extremely
respectable
at
that
time
i
was
not
a
colonel
but
like
boutin
himself
a
common
trooper
happily
there
were
certain
details
of
this
adventure
which
could
be
known
only
to
us
two
and
when
i
recalled
them
to
his
mind
his
incredulity
diminished
i
then
told
him
the
story
of
my
singular
experiences
although
my
eyes
and
my
voice
he
told
me
were
strangely
altered
although
i
had
neither
hair
teeth
nor
eyebrows
and
was
as
colorless
as
an
albino
he
at
last
recognized
his
colonel
in
the
beggar
after
a
thousand
questions
which
i
answered
triumphantly
he
related
his
adventures
they
were
not
less
extraordinary
than
my
own
he
had
lately
come
back
from
the
frontiers
of
china
which
he
had
tried
to
cross
after
escaping
from
siberia
he
told
me
of
the
catastrophe
of
the
russian
campaign
and
of
napoleon
s
first
abdication
that
news
was
one
of
the
things
which
caused
me
most
anguish
we
were
two
curious
derelicts
having
been
rolled
over
the
globe
as
pebbles
are
rolled
by
the
ocean
when
storms
bear
them
from
shore
to
shore
between
us
we
had
seen
egypt
syria
spain
russia
holland
germany
italy
and
dalmatia
england
china
tartary
siberia
the
only
thing
wanting
was
that
neither
of
us
had
been
to
america
or
the
indies
finally
boutin
who
still
was
more
locomotive
than
i
undertook
to
go
to
paris
as
quickly
as
might
be
to
inform
my
wife
of
the
predicament
in
which
i
was
i
wrote
a
long
letter
full
of
details
to
madame
chabert
that
monsieur
was
the
fourth
if
i
had
had
any
relations
perhaps
nothing
of
all
this
might
have
happened
but
to
be
frank
with
you
i
am
but
a
workhouse
child
a
soldier
whose
sole
fortune
was
his
courage
whose
sole
family
is
mankind
at
large
whose
country
is
france
whose
only
protector
is
the
nay
i
am
wrong
i
had
a
father
the
emperor
ah
if
he
were
but
here
the
dear
man
if
he
could
see
as
he
used
to
call
me
in
the
state
in
which
i
am
now
he
would
be
in
a
rage
what
is
to
be
done
our
sun
is
set
and
we
are
all
out
in
the
cold
now
after
all
political
events
might
account
for
my
wife
s
silence
boutin
set
out
he
was
a
lucky
fellow
he
had
two
bears
admirably
trained
which
brought
him
in
a
living
i
could
not
go
with
him
the
pain
i
suffered
forbade
my
walking
long
stages
i
wept
monsieur
when
we
parted
after
i
had
gone
as
far
as
my
state
allowed
in
company
with
him
and
his
bears
at
carlsruhe
i
had
an
attack
of
neuralgia
in
the
head
and
lay
for
six
weeks
on
straw
in
an
inn
i
should
never
have
ended
if
i
were
to
tell
you
all
the
distresses
of
my
life
as
a
beggar
moral
suffering
before
which
physical
suffering
pales
nevertheless
excites
less
pity
because
it
is
not
seen
i
remember
shedding
tears
as
i
stood
in
front
of
a
fine
house
in
strassburg
where
once
i
had
given
an
entertainment
and
where
nothing
was
given
me
not
even
a
piece
of
bread
having
agreed
with
boutin
on
the
road
i
was
to
take
i
went
to
every
to
ask
if
there
were
a
letter
or
some
money
for
me
i
arrived
at
paris
without
having
found
either
what
despair
i
had
been
forced
to
endure
boutin
must
be
dead
i
told
myself
and
in
fact
the
poor
fellow
was
killed
at
waterloo
i
heard
of
his
death
later
and
by
mere
chance
his
errand
to
my
wife
had
of
course
been
fruitless
at
last
i
entered
paris
with
the
cossacks
to
me
this
was
grief
on
grief
on
seeing
the
russians
in
france
i
quite
forgot
that
i
had
no
shoes
on
my
feet
nor
money
in
my
pocket
yes
monsieur
my
clothes
were
in
tatters
the
evening
before
i
reached
paris
i
was
obliged
to
bivouac
in
the
woods
of
claye
the
chill
of
the
night
air
no
doubt
brought
on
an
attack
of
some
nameless
complaint
which
seized
me
as
i
was
crossing
the
faubourg
i
dropped
almost
senseless
at
the
door
of
an
ironmonger
s
shop
when
i
recovered
i
was
in
a
bed
in
the
there
i
stayed
very
contentedly
for
about
a
month
i
was
then
turned
out
i
had
no
money
but
i
was
well
and
my
feet
were
on
the
good
stones
of
paris
with
what
delight
and
haste
did
i
make
my
way
to
the
rue
du
where
my
wife
should
be
living
in
a
house
belonging
to
me
bah
the
rue
du
was
now
the
rue
de
la
chausee
d
antin
i
could
not
find
my
house
it
had
been
sold
and
pulled
down
speculators
had
built
several
houses
over
my
gardens
not
knowing
that
my
wife
had
married
ferraud
i
could
obtain
no
information
at
last
i
went
to
the
house
of
an
old
lawyer
who
had
been
in
charge
of
my
affairs
this
worthy
man
was
dead
after
selling
his
connection
to
a
younger
man
this
gentleman
informed
me
to
my
great
surprise
of
the
administration
of
my
estate
the
settlement
of
the
moneys
of
my
wife
s
marriage
and
the
birth
of
her
two
children
when
i
told
him
that
i
was
colonel
chabert
he
laughed
so
heartily
that
i
left
him
without
saying
another
word
my
detention
at
stuttgart
had
suggested
possibilities
of
charenton
and
i
determined
to
act
with
caution
then
monsieur
knowing
where
my
wife
lived
i
went
to
her
house
my
heart
high
with
well
said
the
colonel
with
a
gesture
of
concentrated
fury
when
i
called
under
an
assumed
name
i
was
not
admitted
and
on
the
day
when
i
used
my
own
i
was
turned
out
of
doors
to
see
the
countess
come
home
from
a
ball
or
the
play
in
the
early
morning
i
have
sat
whole
nights
through
crouching
close
to
the
wall
of
her
gateway
my
eyes
pierced
the
depths
of
the
carriage
which
flashed
past
me
with
the
swiftness
of
lightning
and
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
woman
who
is
my
wife
and
no
longer
mine
oh
from
that
day
i
have
lived
for
vengeance
cried
the
old
man
in
a
hollow
voice
and
suddenly
standing
up
in
front
of
derville
she
knows
that
i
am
alive
since
my
return
she
has
had
two
letters
written
with
my
own
hand
she
loves
me
no
more
i
i
know
not
whether
i
love
or
hate
her
i
long
for
her
and
curse
her
by
turns
to
me
she
owes
all
her
fortune
all
her
happiness
well
she
has
not
sent
me
the
very
smallest
pittance
sometimes
i
do
not
know
what
will
become
of
me
with
these
words
the
veteran
dropped
on
to
his
chair
again
and
remained
motionless
derville
sat
in
silence
studying
his
client
it
is
a
serious
business
he
said
at
length
mechanically
even
granting
the
genuineness
of
the
documents
to
be
procured
from
heilsberg
it
is
not
proved
to
me
that
we
can
at
once
win
our
case
it
must
go
before
three
tribunals
in
succession
i
must
think
such
a
matter
over
with
a
clear
head
it
is
quite
oh
said
the
colonel
coldly
with
a
haughty
jerk
of
his
head
if
i
fail
i
can
die
but
not
the
feeble
old
man
had
vanished
the
eyes
were
those
of
a
man
of
energy
lighted
up
with
the
spark
of
desire
and
revenge
we
must
perhaps
compromise
said
the
lawyer
compromise
echoed
colonel
chabert
am
i
dead
or
am
i
alive
i
hope
monsieur
the
attorney
went
on
that
you
will
follow
my
advice
your
cause
is
mine
you
will
soon
perceive
the
interest
i
take
in
your
situation
almost
unexampled
in
judicial
records
for
the
moment
i
will
give
you
a
letter
to
my
notary
who
will
pay
to
your
order
fifty
francs
every
ten
days
it
would
be
unbecoming
for
you
to
come
here
to
receive
alms
if
you
are
colonel
chabert
you
ought
to
be
at
no
man
s
mercy
i
shall
record
these
advances
as
a
loan
you
have
estates
to
recover
you
are
this
delicate
compassion
brought
tears
to
the
old
man
s
eyes
derville
rose
hastily
for
it
was
perhaps
not
correct
for
a
lawyer
to
show
emotion
he
went
into
the
adjoining
room
and
came
back
with
an
unsealed
letter
which
he
gave
to
the
colonel
when
the
poor
man
held
it
in
his
hand
he
felt
through
the
paper
two
gold
pieces
will
you
be
good
enough
to
describe
the
documents
and
tell
me
the
name
of
the
town
and
in
what
kingdom
said
the
lawyer
the
colonel
dictated
the
information
and
verified
the
spelling
of
the
names
of
places
then
he
took
his
hat
in
one
hand
looked
at
derville
and
held
out
the
other
a
horny
hand
saying
with
much
simplicity
on
my
honor
sir
after
the
emperor
you
are
the
man
to
whom
i
shall
owe
most
you
are
a
splendid
fellow
the
attorney
clapped
his
hand
into
the
colonel
s
saw
him
to
the
stairs
and
held
a
light
for
him
boucard
said
derville
to
his
head
clerk
i
have
just
listened
to
a
tale
that
may
cost
me
five
and
twenty
louis
if
i
am
robbed
i
shall
not
regret
the
money
for
i
shall
have
seen
the
most
consummate
actor
of
the
when
the
colonel
was
in
the
street
and
close
to
a
lamp
he
took
the
two
pieces
out
of
the
letter
and
looked
at
them
for
a
moment
under
the
light
it
was
the
first
gold
he
had
seen
for
nine
years
i
may
smoke
cigars
he
said
to
himself
about
three
months
after
this
interview
at
night
in
derville
s
room
the
notary
commissioned
to
advance
the
on
derville
s
account
to
his
eccentric
client
came
to
consult
the
attorney
on
a
serious
matter
and
began
by
begging
him
to
refund
the
six
hundred
francs
that
the
old
soldier
had
received
are
you
amusing
yourself
with
pensioning
the
old
army
said
the
notary
laughing
a
young
man
named
crottat
who
had
just
bought
up
the
office
in
which
he
had
been
head
clerk
his
chief
having
fled
in
consequence
of
a
disastrous
bankruptcy
i
have
to
thank
you
my
dear
sir
for
reminding
me
of
that
affair
replied
derville
my
philanthropy
will
not
carry
me
beyond
louis
i
have
i
fear
already
been
the
dupe
of
my
as
derville
finished
the
sentence
he
saw
on
his
desk
the
papers
his
head
clerk
had
laid
out
for
him
his
eye
was
struck
by
the
appearance
of
the
stamps
long
square
and
triangular
in
red
and
blue
ink
which
distinguished
a
letter
that
had
come
through
the
prussian
austrian
bavarian
and
french
ah
ha
said
he
with
a
laugh
here
is
the
last
act
of
the
comedy
now
we
shall
see
if
i
have
been
taken
in
he
took
up
the
letter
and
opened
it
but
he
could
not
read
it
it
was
written
in
german
boucard
go
yourself
and
have
this
letter
translated
and
bring
it
back
immediately
said
derville
half
opening
his
study
door
and
giving
the
letter
to
the
head
clerk
the
notary
at
berlin
to
whom
the
lawyer
had
written
informed
him
that
the
documents
he
had
been
requested
to
forward
would
arrive
within
a
few
days
of
this
note
announcing
them
they
were
he
said
all
perfectly
regular
and
duly
witnessed
and
legally
stamped
to
serve
as
evidence
in
law
he
also
informed
him
that
almost
all
the
witnesses
to
the
facts
recorded
under
these
affidavits
were
still
to
be
found
at
eylau
in
prussia
and
that
the
woman
to
whom
le
comte
chabert
owed
his
life
was
still
living
in
a
suburb
of
heilsberg
this
looks
like
business
cried
derville
when
boucard
had
given
him
the
substance
of
the
letter
but
look
here
my
boy
he
went
on
addressing
the
notary
i
shall
want
some
information
which
ought
to
exist
in
your
office
was
it
not
that
old
rascal
roguin
we
will
say
that
unfortunate
that
roguin
interrupted
alexandre
crottat
with
a
laugh
well
was
it
not
that
man
who
has
just
carried
off
eight
hundred
thousand
francs
of
his
clients
money
and
reduced
several
families
to
despair
who
effected
the
settlement
of
chabert
s
estate
i
fancy
i
have
seen
that
in
the
documents
in
our
case
of
yes
said
crottat
it
was
when
i
was
third
clerk
i
copied
the
papers
and
studied
them
thoroughly
rose
chapotel
wife
and
widow
of
hyacinthe
called
chabert
count
of
the
empire
grand
officer
of
the
legion
of
honor
they
had
married
without
settlement
thus
they
held
all
the
property
in
common
to
the
best
of
my
recollections
the
personalty
was
about
six
hundred
thousand
francs
before
his
marriage
colonel
chabert
had
made
a
will
in
favor
of
the
hospitals
of
paris
by
which
he
left
them
of
the
fortune
he
might
possess
at
the
time
of
his
decease
the
state
to
take
the
other
quarter
the
will
was
contested
there
was
a
forced
sale
and
then
a
division
for
the
attorneys
went
at
a
pace
at
the
time
of
the
settlement
the
monster
who
was
then
governing
france
handed
over
to
the
widow
by
special
decree
the
portion
bequeathed
to
the
so
that
comte
chabert
s
personal
fortune
was
no
more
than
three
hundred
thousand
francs
consequently
so
it
was
old
fellow
said
crottat
you
lawyers
sometimes
are
very
though
you
are
accused
of
false
practices
in
pleading
for
one
side
or
the
colonel
chabert
whose
address
was
written
at
the
bottom
of
the
first
receipt
he
had
given
the
notary
was
lodging
in
the
faubourg
rue
du
with
an
old
quartermaster
of
the
imperial
guard
now
a
cowkeeper
named
vergniaud
having
reached
the
spot
derville
was
obliged
to
go
on
foot
in
search
of
his
client
for
his
coachman
declined
to
drive
along
an
unpaved
street
where
the
ruts
were
rather
too
deep
for
cab
wheels
looking
about
him
on
all
sides
the
lawyer
at
last
discovered
at
the
end
of
the
street
nearest
to
the
boulevard
between
two
walls
built
of
bones
and
mud
two
shabby
stone
much
knocked
about
by
carts
in
spite
of
two
wooden
stumps
that
served
as
blocks
these
posts
supported
a
cross
beam
with
a
penthouse
coping
of
tiles
and
on
the
beam
in
red
letters
were
the
words
vergniaud
to
the
right
of
this
inscription
were
some
eggs
to
the
left
a
cow
all
painted
in
white
the
gate
was
open
and
no
doubt
remained
open
all
day
beyond
a
yard
there
was
a
house
facing
the
gate
if
indeed
the
name
of
house
may
be
applied
to
one
of
the
hovels
built
in
the
neighborhood
of
paris
which
are
like
nothing
else
not
even
the
most
wretched
dwellings
in
the
country
of
which
they
have
all
the
poverty
without
their
poetry
indeed
in
the
midst
of
the
fields
even
a
hovel
may
have
a
certain
grace
derived
from
the
pure
air
the
verdure
the
open
country
a
hill
a
serpentine
road
vineyards
quickset
hedges
thatch
and
rural
implements
but
poverty
in
paris
gains
dignity
only
by
horror
though
recently
built
this
house
seemed
ready
to
fall
into
ruins
none
of
its
materials
had
found
a
legitimate
use
they
had
been
collected
from
the
various
demolitions
which
are
going
on
every
day
in
paris
on
a
shutter
made
of
the
boards
of
a
derville
read
the
words
fancy
the
windows
were
all
mismatched
and
grotesquely
placed
the
ground
floor
which
seemed
to
be
the
habitable
part
was
on
one
side
raised
above
the
soil
and
on
the
other
sunk
in
the
rising
ground
between
the
gate
and
the
house
lay
a
puddle
full
of
stable
litter
into
which
flowed
the
and
house
waste
the
back
wall
of
this
frail
construction
which
seemed
rather
more
solidly
built
than
the
rest
supported
a
row
of
barred
hutches
where
rabbits
bred
their
numerous
families
to
the
right
of
the
gate
was
the
cowhouse
with
a
loft
above
for
fodder
it
communicated
with
the
house
through
the
dairy
to
the
left
was
a
poultry
yard
with
a
stable
and
the
roofs
finished
like
that
of
the
house
with
rough
deal
boards
nailed
so
as
to
overlap
and
shabbily
thatched
with
rushes
like
most
of
the
places
where
the
elements
of
the
huge
meal
daily
devoured
by
paris
are
every
day
prepared
the
yard
derville
now
entered
showed
traces
of
the
hurry
that
comes
of
the
necessity
for
being
ready
at
a
fixed
hour
the
large
tin
cans
in
which
milk
is
carried
and
the
little
pots
for
cream
were
flung
at
the
dairy
door
with
their
stoppers
the
rags
that
were
used
to
clean
them
fluttered
in
the
sunshine
riddled
with
holes
hanging
to
strings
fastened
to
poles
the
placid
horse
of
a
breed
known
only
to
had
gone
a
few
steps
from
the
cart
and
was
standing
in
front
of
the
stable
the
door
being
shut
a
goat
was
munching
the
shoots
of
a
starved
and
dusty
vine
that
clung
to
the
cracked
yellow
wall
of
the
house
a
cat
squatting
on
the
cream
jars
was
licking
them
over
the
fowls
scared
by
derville
s
approach
scuttered
away
screaming
and
the
barked
and
the
man
who
decided
the
victory
at
eylau
is
to
be
found
here
said
derville
to
himself
as
his
eyes
took
in
at
a
glance
the
general
effect
of
the
squalid
scene
the
house
had
been
left
in
charge
of
three
little
boys
one
who
had
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
cart
loaded
with
hay
was
pitching
stones
into
the
chimney
of
a
neighboring
house
in
the
hope
that
they
might
fall
into
a
saucepan
another
was
trying
to
get
a
pig
into
a
cart
to
hoist
it
by
making
the
whole
thing
tilt
when
derville
asked
them
if
chabert
lived
there
neither
of
them
replied
but
all
three
looked
at
him
with
a
sort
of
bright
stupidity
if
i
may
combine
those
two
words
derville
repeated
his
questions
but
without
success
provoked
by
the
saucy
cunning
of
these
three
imps
he
abused
them
with
the
sort
of
pleasantry
which
young
men
think
they
have
the
right
to
address
to
little
boys
and
they
broke
the
silence
with
a
then
derville
was
angry
the
colonel
hearing
him
now
came
out
of
the
little
low
room
close
to
the
dairy
and
stood
on
the
threshold
of
his
doorway
with
indescribable
military
coolness
he
had
in
his
mouth
a
very
pipe
a
technical
phrase
to
a
smoker
a
humble
short
clay
pipe
of
the
kind
called
he
lifted
the
peak
of
a
dreadfully
greasy
cloth
cap
saw
derville
and
came
straight
across
the
midden
to
join
his
benefactor
the
sooner
calling
out
in
friendly
tones
to
the
boys
silence
in
the
ranks
the
children
at
once
kept
a
respectful
silence
which
showed
the
power
the
old
soldier
had
over
them
why
did
you
not
write
to
me
he
said
to
derville
go
along
by
the
cowhouse
there
the
path
is
paved
there
he
exclaimed
seeing
the
lawyer
s
hesitancy
for
he
did
not
wish
to
wet
his
feet
in
the
manure
heap
jumping
from
one
dry
spot
to
another
derville
reached
the
door
by
which
the
colonel
had
come
out
chabert
seemed
but
ill
pleased
at
having
to
receive
him
in
the
he
occupied
and
in
fact
derville
found
but
one
chair
there
the
colonel
s
bed
consisted
of
some
trusses
of
straw
over
which
his
hostess
had
spread
two
or
three
of
those
old
fragments
of
carpet
picked
up
heaven
knows
where
which
use
to
cover
the
seats
of
their
carts
the
floor
was
simply
the
trodden
earth
the
walls
sweating
green
with
mould
and
full
of
cracks
were
so
excessively
damp
that
on
the
side
where
the
colonel
s
bed
was
a
reed
mat
had
been
nailed
the
famous
hung
on
a
nail
two
pairs
of
old
boots
lay
in
a
corner
there
was
not
a
sign
of
linen
on
the
table
the
de
la
grande
reprinted
by
plancher
lay
open
and
seemed
to
be
the
colonel
s
reading
his
countenance
was
calm
and
serene
in
the
midst
of
this
squalor
his
visit
to
derville
seemed
to
have
altered
his
features
the
lawyer
perceived
in
them
traces
of
a
happy
feeling
a
particular
gleam
set
there
by
hope
does
the
smell
of
the
pipe
annoy
you
he
said
placing
the
dilapidated
chair
for
his
lawyer
but
colonel
you
are
dreadfully
uncomfortable
here
the
speech
was
wrung
from
derville
by
the
distrust
natural
to
lawyers
and
the
deplorable
experience
which
they
derive
early
in
life
from
the
appalling
and
obscure
tragedies
at
which
they
look
on
here
said
he
to
himself
is
a
man
who
has
of
course
spent
my
money
in
satisfying
a
trooper
s
three
theological
virtues
play
wine
and
women
to
be
sure
monsieur
we
are
not
distinguished
for
luxury
here
it
is
a
camp
lodging
tempered
by
friendship
but
and
the
soldier
shot
a
deep
glance
at
the
man
of
law
i
have
done
no
one
wrong
i
have
never
turned
my
back
on
anybody
and
i
sleep
in
derville
reflected
that
there
would
be
some
want
of
delicacy
in
asking
his
client
to
account
for
the
sums
of
money
he
had
advanced
so
he
merely
said
but
why
would
you
not
come
to
paris
where
you
might
have
lived
as
cheaply
as
you
do
here
but
where
you
would
have
been
better
lodged
why
replied
the
colonel
the
good
folks
with
whom
i
am
living
had
taken
me
in
and
fed
me
for
a
year
how
could
i
leave
them
just
when
i
had
a
little
money
besides
the
father
of
those
three
pickles
is
an
old
an
egyptian
we
give
that
name
to
the
troopers
who
came
back
from
the
expedition
into
egypt
of
which
i
was
one
not
merely
are
all
who
get
back
brothers
vergniaud
was
in
my
regiment
we
have
shared
a
draught
of
water
in
the
desert
and
besides
i
have
not
yet
finished
teaching
his
brats
to
he
might
have
lodged
you
better
for
your
money
said
derville
bah
said
the
colonel
his
children
sleep
on
the
straw
as
i
do
he
and
his
wife
have
no
better
bed
they
are
very
poor
you
see
they
have
taken
a
bigger
business
than
they
can
manage
but
if
i
recover
my
fortune
however
it
does
very
colonel
or
the
next
day
i
shall
receive
your
papers
from
heilsberg
the
woman
who
dug
you
out
is
still
alive
curse
the
money
to
think
i
haven
t
got
any
he
cried
flinging
his
pipe
on
the
ground
now
a
pipe
is
to
a
smoker
a
precious
possession
but
the
impulse
was
so
natural
the
emotion
so
generous
that
every
smoker
and
the
excise
office
itself
would
have
pardoned
this
crime
of
treason
to
tobacco
perhaps
the
angels
may
have
picked
up
the
pieces
colonel
it
is
an
exceedingly
complicated
business
said
derville
as
they
left
the
room
to
walk
up
and
down
in
the
sunshine
to
me
said
the
soldier
it
appears
exceedingly
simple
i
was
thought
to
be
dead
and
here
i
am
give
me
back
my
wife
and
my
fortune
give
me
the
rank
of
general
to
which
i
have
a
right
for
i
was
made
colonel
of
the
imperial
guard
the
day
before
the
battle
of
things
are
not
done
so
in
the
legal
world
said
derville
listen
to
me
you
are
colonel
chabert
i
am
glad
to
think
it
but
it
has
to
be
proved
judicially
to
persons
whose
interest
it
will
be
to
deny
it
hence
your
papers
will
be
disputed
that
contention
will
give
rise
to
ten
or
twelve
preliminary
inquiries
every
question
will
be
sent
under
contradiction
up
to
the
supreme
court
and
give
rise
to
so
many
costly
suits
which
will
hang
on
for
a
long
time
however
eagerly
i
may
push
them
your
opponents
will
demand
an
inquiry
which
we
can
not
refuse
and
which
may
necessitate
the
sending
of
a
commission
of
investigation
to
prussia
but
even
if
we
hope
for
the
best
supposing
that
justice
should
at
once
recognize
you
as
colonel
chabert
can
we
know
how
the
questions
will
be
settled
that
will
arise
out
of
the
very
innocent
bigamy
committed
by
the
comtesse
ferraud
in
your
case
the
point
of
law
is
unknown
to
the
code
and
can
only
be
decided
as
a
point
in
equity
as
a
jury
decides
in
the
delicate
cases
presented
by
the
social
eccentricities
of
some
criminal
prosecutions
now
you
had
no
children
by
your
marriage
le
comte
ferraud
has
two
the
judges
might
pronounce
against
the
marriage
where
the
family
ties
are
weakest
to
the
confirmation
of
that
where
they
are
stronger
since
it
was
contracted
in
perfect
good
faith
would
you
be
in
a
very
becoming
moral
position
if
you
insisted
at
your
age
and
in
your
present
circumstances
in
resuming
your
rights
over
a
woman
who
no
longer
loves
you
you
will
have
both
your
wife
and
her
husband
against
you
two
important
persons
who
might
influence
the
bench
thus
there
are
many
elements
which
would
prolong
the
case
you
will
have
time
to
grow
old
in
the
bitterest
and
my
fortune
do
you
suppose
you
had
a
fine
fortune
had
i
not
thirty
thousand
francs
a
year
my
dear
colonel
in
you
made
a
will
before
your
marriage
leaving
of
your
property
to
that
is
well
when
you
were
reported
dead
it
was
necessary
to
make
a
valuation
and
have
a
sale
to
give
this
quarter
away
your
wife
was
not
particular
about
honesty
as
to
the
poor
the
valuation
in
which
she
no
doubt
took
care
not
to
include
the
ready
money
or
jewelry
or
too
much
of
the
plate
and
in
which
the
furniture
would
be
estimated
at
of
its
actual
cost
either
to
benefit
her
or
to
lighten
the
succession
duty
and
also
because
a
valuer
can
be
held
responsible
for
the
declared
value
the
valuation
thus
made
stood
at
six
hundred
thousand
francs
your
wife
had
a
right
of
half
for
her
share
everything
was
sold
and
bought
in
by
her
she
got
something
out
of
it
all
and
the
hospitals
got
their
thousand
francs
then
as
the
remainder
went
to
the
state
since
you
had
made
no
mention
of
your
wife
in
your
will
the
emperor
restored
to
your
widow
by
decree
the
residue
which
would
have
reverted
to
the
exchequer
so
now
what
can
you
claim
three
hundred
thousand
francs
no
more
and
minus
the
and
you
call
that
justice
said
the
colonel
in
dismay
why
certainly
a
pretty
kind
of
justice
so
it
is
my
dear
colonel
you
see
that
what
you
thought
so
easy
is
not
so
madame
ferraud
might
even
choose
to
keep
the
sum
given
to
her
by
the
but
she
was
not
a
widow
the
decree
is
utterly
void
i
agree
with
you
but
every
case
can
get
a
hearing
listen
to
me
i
think
that
under
these
circumstances
a
compromise
would
be
both
for
her
and
for
you
the
best
solution
of
the
question
you
will
gain
by
it
a
more
considerable
sum
than
you
can
prove
a
right
that
would
be
to
sell
my
wife
with
thousand
francs
a
year
you
could
find
a
woman
who
in
the
position
in
which
you
are
would
suit
you
better
than
your
own
wife
and
make
you
happier
i
propose
going
this
very
day
to
see
the
comtesse
ferraud
and
sounding
the
ground
but
i
would
not
take
such
a
step
without
giving
you
due
let
us
go
what
just
as
you
are
said
the
lawyer
no
my
dear
colonel
no
you
might
lose
your
case
on
the
can
i
possibly
gain
it
on
every
count
replied
derville
but
my
dear
colonel
chabert
you
overlook
one
thing
i
am
not
rich
the
price
of
my
connection
is
not
wholly
paid
up
if
the
bench
should
allow
you
a
maintenance
that
is
to
say
a
sum
advanced
on
your
prospects
they
will
not
do
so
till
you
have
proved
that
you
are
comte
chabert
grand
officer
of
the
legion
of
to
be
sure
i
am
a
grand
officer
of
the
legion
of
honor
i
had
forgotten
that
said
he
simply
well
until
then
derville
went
on
will
you
not
have
to
engage
pleaders
to
have
documents
copied
to
keep
the
underlings
of
the
law
going
and
to
support
yourself
the
expenses
of
the
preliminary
inquiries
will
at
a
rough
guess
amount
to
ten
or
twelve
thousand
francs
i
have
not
so
much
to
lend
you
i
am
crushed
as
it
is
by
the
enormous
interest
i
have
to
pay
on
the
money
i
borrowed
to
buy
my
business
and
you
where
can
you
find
large
tears
gathered
in
the
poor
veteran
s
faded
eyes
and
rolled
down
his
withered
cheeks
this
outlook
of
difficulties
discouraged
him
the
social
and
the
legal
world
weighed
on
his
breast
like
a
nightmare
i
will
go
to
the
foot
of
the
vendome
column
he
cried
i
will
call
out
i
am
colonel
chabert
who
rode
through
the
russian
square
at
eylau
the
statue
he
he
will
know
and
you
will
find
yourself
in
at
this
terrible
name
the
soldier
s
transports
collapsed
and
will
there
be
no
hope
for
me
at
the
ministry
of
war
the
war
office
said
derville
well
go
there
but
take
a
formal
legal
opinion
with
you
nullifying
the
certificate
of
your
death
the
government
offices
would
be
only
too
glad
if
they
could
annihilate
the
men
of
the
the
colonel
stood
for
a
while
speechless
motionless
his
eyes
fixed
but
seeing
nothing
sunk
in
bottomless
despair
military
justice
is
ready
and
swift
it
decides
with
finality
and
almost
always
rightly
this
was
the
only
justice
known
to
chabert
as
he
saw
the
labyrinth
of
difficulties
into
which
he
must
plunge
and
how
much
money
would
be
required
for
the
journey
the
poor
old
soldier
was
mortally
hit
in
that
power
peculiar
to
man
and
called
the
will
he
thought
it
would
be
impossible
to
live
as
party
to
a
lawsuit
it
seemed
a
thousand
times
simpler
to
remain
poor
and
a
beggar
or
to
enlist
as
a
trooper
if
any
regiment
would
pass
him
his
physical
and
mental
sufferings
had
already
impaired
his
bodily
health
in
some
of
the
most
important
organs
he
was
on
the
verge
of
one
of
those
maladies
for
which
medicine
has
no
name
and
of
which
the
seat
is
in
some
degree
variable
like
the
nervous
system
itself
the
part
most
frequently
attacked
of
the
whole
human
machine
a
malady
which
may
be
designated
as
the
of
the
unfortunate
however
serious
this
invisible
but
real
disorder
might
already
be
it
could
still
be
cured
by
a
happy
issue
but
a
fresh
obstacle
an
unexpected
incident
would
be
enough
to
wreck
this
vigorous
constitution
to
break
the
weakened
springs
and
produce
the
hesitancy
the
aimless
unfinished
movements
which
physiologists
know
well
in
men
undermined
by
grief
derville
detecting
in
his
client
the
symptoms
of
extreme
dejection
said
to
him
take
courage
the
end
of
the
business
can
not
fail
to
be
in
your
favor
only
consider
whether
you
can
give
me
your
whole
confidence
and
blindly
accept
the
result
i
may
think
best
for
your
do
what
you
will
said
chabert
yes
but
you
surrender
yourself
to
me
like
a
man
marching
to
his
must
i
not
be
left
to
live
without
a
position
without
a
name
is
that
endurable
that
is
not
my
view
of
it
said
the
lawyer
we
will
try
a
friendly
suit
to
annul
both
your
death
certificate
and
your
marriage
so
as
to
put
you
in
possession
of
your
rights
you
may
even
by
comte
ferraud
s
intervention
have
your
name
replaced
on
the
army
list
as
general
and
no
doubt
you
will
get
a
well
proceed
then
said
chabert
i
put
myself
entirely
in
your
i
will
send
you
a
power
of
attorney
to
sign
said
derville
keep
up
your
courage
if
you
want
money
rely
on
chabert
warmly
wrung
the
lawyer
s
hand
and
remained
standing
with
his
back
against
the
wall
not
having
the
energy
to
follow
him
excepting
with
his
eyes
like
all
men
who
know
but
little
of
legal
matters
he
was
frightened
by
this
unforeseen
struggle
during
their
interview
several
times
the
figure
of
a
man
posted
in
the
street
had
come
forward
from
behind
one
of
the
watching
for
derville
to
depart
and
he
now
accosted
the
lawyer
he
was
an
old
man
wearing
a
blue
waistcoat
and
a
kilt
like
a
brewer
s
on
his
head
was
an
cap
his
face
was
tanned
and
wrinkled
but
ruddy
on
the
by
hard
work
and
exposure
to
the
open
air
asking
your
pardon
sir
said
he
taking
derville
by
the
arm
if
i
take
the
liberty
of
speaking
to
you
but
i
fancied
from
the
look
of
you
that
you
were
a
friend
of
our
general
and
what
then
replied
derville
what
concern
have
you
with
him
but
who
are
you
said
the
cautious
lawyer
i
am
louis
vergniaud
he
replied
at
once
i
have
a
few
words
to
say
to
so
you
are
the
man
who
has
lodged
comte
chabert
as
i
have
found
him
asking
your
pardon
sir
he
has
the
best
room
i
would
have
given
him
mine
if
i
had
had
but
one
i
could
have
slept
in
the
stable
a
man
who
has
suffered
as
he
has
who
teaches
my
kids
to
read
a
general
an
egyptian
the
first
lieutenant
i
ever
served
under
what
do
you
think
of
us
all
he
is
best
served
i
shared
what
i
had
with
him
unfortunately
it
is
not
much
to
boast
of
bread
milk
eggs
well
well
it
s
neighbors
fare
sir
and
he
is
heartily
but
he
has
hurt
our
he
yes
sir
hurt
our
feelings
to
be
plain
with
you
i
have
taken
a
larger
business
than
i
can
manage
and
he
saw
it
well
it
worried
him
he
must
needs
mind
the
horse
i
says
to
him
really
general
bah
says
he
i
am
not
going
to
eat
my
head
off
doing
nothing
i
learned
to
rub
a
horse
down
many
a
year
i
had
some
bills
out
for
the
purchase
money
of
my
dairy
a
fellow
named
grados
do
you
know
him
sir
but
my
good
man
i
have
not
time
to
listen
to
your
story
only
tell
me
how
the
colonel
offended
he
hurt
our
feelings
sir
as
sure
as
my
name
is
louis
vergniaud
and
my
wife
cried
about
it
he
heard
from
our
neighbors
that
we
had
not
a
sou
to
begin
to
meet
the
bills
with
the
old
soldier
as
he
is
he
saved
up
all
you
gave
him
he
watched
for
the
bill
to
come
in
and
he
paid
it
such
a
trick
while
my
wife
and
me
we
knew
he
had
no
tobacco
poor
old
boy
and
went
oh
now
yes
he
has
his
cigar
every
morning
i
would
sell
my
soul
for
it
no
we
are
hurt
well
so
i
wanted
to
ask
you
for
he
said
you
were
a
good
sort
to
lend
us
a
hundred
crowns
on
the
stock
so
that
we
may
get
him
some
clothes
and
furnish
his
room
he
thought
he
was
getting
us
out
of
debt
you
see
well
it
s
just
the
other
way
the
old
man
is
running
us
into
debt
and
hurt
our
feelings
he
ought
not
to
have
stolen
a
march
on
us
like
that
and
we
his
friends
too
on
my
word
as
an
honest
man
as
sure
as
my
name
is
louis
vergniaud
i
would
sooner
sell
up
and
enlist
than
fail
to
pay
you
back
your
money
derville
looked
at
the
dairyman
and
stepped
back
a
few
paces
to
glance
at
the
house
the
yard
the
the
cowhouse

rabbits
the
children
on
my
honor
i
believe
it
is
characteristic
of
virtue
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
riches
thought
he
all
right
you
shall
have
your
hundred
crowns
and
more
but
i
shall
not
give
them
to
you
the
colonel
will
be
rich
enough
to
help
and
i
will
not
deprive
him
of
the
and
will
that
be
soon
why
ah
dear
god
how
glad
my
wife
will
be
and
the
cowkeeper
s
tanned
face
seemed
to
expand
now
said
derville
to
himself
as
he
got
into
his
cab
again
let
us
call
on
our
opponent
we
must
not
show
our
hand
but
try
to
see
hers
and
win
the
game
at
one
stroke
she
must
be
frightened
she
is
a
woman
now
what
frightens
women
most
a
woman
is
afraid
of
nothing
but
and
he
set
to
work
to
study
the
countess
position
falling
into
one
of
those
brown
studies
to
which
great
politicians
give
themselves
up
when
concocting
their
own
plans
and
trying
to
guess
the
secrets
of
a
hostile
cabinet
are
not
attorneys
in
a
way
statesmen
in
charge
of
private
affairs
but
a
brief
survey
of
the
situation
in
which
the
comte
ferraud
and
his
wife
now
found
themselves
is
necessary
for
a
comprehension
of
the
lawyer
s
cleverness
monsieur
le
comte
ferraud
was
the
only
son
of
a
former
councillor
in
the
old
of
paris
who
had
emigrated
during
the
reign
of
terror
and
so
though
he
saved
his
head
lost
his
fortune
he
came
back
under
the
consulate
and
remained
persistently
faithful
to
the
cause
of
louis
in
whose
circle
his
father
had
moved
before
the
revolution
he
thus
was
one
of
the
party
in
the
faubourg
which
nobly
stood
out
against
napoleon
s
blandishments
the
reputation
for
capacity
gained
by
the
young
count
then
simply
called
monsieur
ferraud
made
him
the
object
of
the
emperor
s
advances
for
he
was
often
as
well
pleased
at
his
conquests
among
the
aristocracy
as
at
gaining
a
battle
the
count
was
promised
the
restitution
of
his
title
of
such
of
his
estates
as
had
not
been
sold
and
he
was
shown
in
perspective
a
place
in
the
ministry
or
as
senator
the
emperor
fell
at
the
time
of
comte
chabert
s
death
ferraud
was
a
young
man
of
without
a
fortune
of
pleasing
appearance
who
had
had
his
successes
and
whom
the
faubourg
had
adopted
as
doing
it
credit
but
madame
la
comtesse
chabert
had
managed
to
turn
her
share
of
her
husband
s
fortune
to
such
good
account
that
after
eighteen
months
of
widowhood
she
had
about
forty
thousand
francs
a
year
her
marriage
to
the
young
count
was
not
regarded
as
news
in
the
circles
of
the
faubourg
napoleon
approving
of
this
union
which
carried
out
his
idea
of
fusion
restored
to
madame
chabert
the
money
falling
to
the
exchequer
under
her
husband
s
will
but
napoleon
s
hopes
were
again
disappointed
madame
ferraud
was
not
only
in
love
with
her
lover
she
had
also
been
fascinated
by
the
notion
of
getting
into
the
haughty
society
which
in
spite
of
its
humiliation
was
still
predominant
at
the
imperial
court
by
this
marriage
all
her
vanities
were
as
much
gratified
as
her
passions
she
was
to
become
a
real
fine
lady
when
the
faubourg
understood
that
the
young
count
s
marriage
did
not
mean
desertion
its
were
thrown
open
to
his
wife
then
came
the
restoration
the
count
s
political
advancement
was
not
rapid
he
understood
the
exigencies
of
the
situation
in
which
louis
xviii
found
himself
he
was
one
of
the
inner
circle
who
waited
till
the
gulf
of
revolution
should
be
closed
for
this
phrase
of
the
king
s
at
which
the
liberals
laughed
so
heartily
had
a
political
sense
the
order
quoted
in
the
long
lawyer
s
preamble
at
the
beginning
of
this
story
had
however
put
him
in
possession
of
two
tracts
of
forest
and
of
an
estate
which
had
considerably
increased
in
value
during
its
sequestration
at
the
present
moment
though
comte
ferraud
was
a
councillor
of
state
and
a
he
regarded
his
position
as
merely
the
first
step
of
his
political
career
wholly
occupied
as
he
was
by
the
anxieties
of
consuming
ambition
he
had
attached
to
himself
as
secretary
a
ruined
attorney
named
delbecq
a
more
than
clever
man
versed
in
all
the
resources
of
the
law
to
whom
he
left
the
conduct
of
his
private
affairs
this
shrewd
practitioner
had
so
well
understood
his
position
with
the
count
as
to
be
honest
in
his
own
interest
he
hoped
to
get
some
place
by
his
master
s
influence
and
he
made
the
count
s
fortune
his
first
care
his
conduct
so
effectually
gave
the
lie
to
his
former
life
that
he
was
regarded
as
a
slandered
man
the
countess
with
the
tact
and
shrewdness
of
which
most
women
have
a
share
more
or
less
understood
the
man
s
motives
watched
him
quietly
and
managed
him
so
well
that
she
had
made
good
use
of
him
for
the
augmentation
of
her
private
fortune
she
had
contrived
to
make
delbecq
believe
that
she
ruled
her
husband
and
had
promised
to
get
him
appointed
president
of
an
inferior
court
in
some
important
provincial
town
if
he
devoted
himself
entirely
to
her
interests
the
promise
of
a
place
not
dependent
on
changes
of
ministry
which
would
allow
of
his
marrying
advantageously
and
rising
subsequently
to
a
high
political
position
by
being
chosen
depute
made
delbecq
the
countess
abject
slave
he
had
never
allowed
her
to
miss
one
of
those
favorable
chances
which
the
fluctuations
of
the
bourse
and
the
increased
value
of
property
afforded
to
clever
financiers
in
paris
during
the
first
three
years
after
the
restoration
he
had
trebled
his
protectress
capital
and
all
the
more
easily
because
the
countess
had
no
scruples
as
to
the
means
which
might
make
her
an
enormous
fortune
as
quickly
as
possible
the
emoluments
derived
by
the
count
from
the
places
he
held
she
spent
on
the
housekeeping
so
as
to
reinvest
her
dividends
and
delbecq
lent
himself
to
these
calculations
of
avarice
without
trying
to
account
for
her
motives
people
of
that
sort
never
trouble
themselves
about
any
secrets
of
which
the
discovery
is
not
necessary
to
their
own
interests
and
indeed
he
naturally
found
the
reason
in
the
thirst
for
money
which
taints
almost
every
parisian
woman
and
as
a
fine
fortune
was
needed
to
support
the
pretensions
of
comte
ferraud
the
secretary
sometimes
fancied
that
he
saw
in
the
countess
greed
a
consequence
of
her
devotion
to
a
husband
with
whom
she
still
was
in
love
the
countess
buried
the
secrets
of
her
conduct
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
there
lay
the
secrets
of
life
and
death
to
her
there
lay
the
of
this
history
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
the
restoration
was
settled
on
an
apparently
immovable
foundation
its
doctrines
of
government
as
understood
by
lofty
minds
seemed
calculated
to
bring
to
france
an
era
of
renewed
prosperity
and
parisian
society
changed
its
aspect
madame
la
comtesse
ferraud
found
that
by
chance
she
had
achieved
for
love
a
marriage
that
had
brought
her
fortune
and
gratified
ambition
still
young
and
handsome
madame
ferraud
played
the
part
of
a
woman
of
fashion
and
lived
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
court
rich
herself
with
a
rich
husband
who
was
cried
up
as
one
of
the
ablest
men
of
the
royalist
party
and
as
a
friend
of
the
king
certain
to
be
made
minister
she
belonged
to
the
aristocracy
and
shared
its
magnificence
in
the
midst
of
this
triumph
she
was
attacked
by
a
moral
canker
there
are
feelings
which
women
guess
in
spite
of
the
care
men
take
to
bury
them
on
the
first
return
of
the
king
comte
ferraud
had
begun
to
regret
his
marriage
colonel
chabert
s
widow
had
not
been
the
means
of
allying
him
to
anybody
he
was
alone
and
unsupported
in
steering
his
way
in
a
course
full
of
shoals
and
beset
by
enemies
also
perhaps
when
he
came
to
judge
his
wife
coolly
he
may
have
discerned
in
her
certain
vices
of
education
which
made
her
unfit
to
second
him
in
his
schemes
a
speech
he
made
of
talleyrand
s
marriage
enlightened
the
countess
to
whom
it
proved
that
if
he
had
still
been
a
free
man
she
would
never
have
been
madame
ferraud
what
woman
could
forgive
this
repentance
does
it
not
include
the
germs
of
every
insult
every
crime
every
form
of
repudiation
but
what
a
wound
must
it
have
left
in
the
countess
heart
supposing
that
she
lived
in
the
dread
of
her
first
husband
s
return
she
had
known
that
he
still
lived
and
she
had
ignored
him
then
during
the
time
when
she
had
heard
no
more
of
him
she
had
chosen
to
believe
that
he
had
fallen
at
waterloo
with
the
imperial
eagle
at
the
same
time
as
boutin
she
resolved
nevertheless
to
bind
the
count
to
her
by
the
strongest
of
all
ties
by
a
chain
of
gold
and
vowed
to
be
so
rich
that
her
fortune
might
make
her
second
marriage
dissoluble
if
by
chance
colonel
chabert
should
ever
reappear
and
he
had
reappeared
and
she
could
not
explain
to
herself
why
the
struggle
she
had
dreaded
had
not
already
begun
suffering
sickness
had
perhaps
delivered
her
from
that
man
perhaps
he
was
half
mad
and
charenton
might
yet
do
her
justice
she
had
not
chosen
to
take
either
delbecq
or
the
police
into
her
confidence
for
fear
of
putting
herself
in
their
power
or
of
hastening
the
catastrophe
there
are
in
paris
many
women
who
like
the
countess
ferraud
live
with
an
unknown
moral
monster
or
on
the
brink
of
an
abyss
a
callus
forms
over
the
spot
that
tortures
them
and
they
can
still
laugh
and
enjoy
themselves
there
is
something
very
strange
in
comte
ferraud
s
position
said
derville
to
himself
on
emerging
from
his
long
reverie
as
his
cab
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
ferraud
in
the
rue
de
varennes
how
is
it
that
he
so
rich
as
he
is
and
such
a
favorite
with
the
king
is
not
yet
a
peer
of
france
it
may
to
be
sure
be
true
that
the
king
as
mme
de
grandlieu
was
telling
me
desires
to
keep
up
the
value
of
the
by
not
bestowing
it
right
and
left
and
after
all
the
son
of
a
councillor
of
the
is
not
a
crillon
nor
a
rohan
a
comte
ferraud
can
only
get
into
the
upper
chamber
surreptitiously
but
if
his
marriage
were
annulled
could
he
not
get
the
dignity
of
some
old
peer
who
has
only
daughters
transferred
to
himself
to
the
king
s
great
satisfaction
at
any
rate
this
will
be
a
good
bogey
to
put
forward
and
frighten
the
countess
thought
he
as
he
went
up
the
steps
derville
had
without
knowing
it
laid
his
finger
on
the
hidden
wound
put
his
hand
on
the
canker
that
consumed
madame
ferraud
she
received
him
in
a
pretty
winter
where
she
was
at
breakfast
while
playing
with
a
monkey
tethered
by
a
chain
to
a
little
pole
with
climbing
bars
of
iron
the
countess
was
in
an
elegant
wrapper
the
curls
of
her
hair
carelessly
pinned
up
escaped
from
a
cap
giving
her
an
arch
look
she
was
fresh
and
smiling
silver
gilding
and
shone
on
the
table
and
all
about
the
room
were
rare
plants
growing
in
magnificent
china
jars
as
he
saw
colonel
chabert
s
wife
rich
with
his
spoil
in
the
lap
of
luxury
and
the
height
of
fashion
while
he
poor
wretch
was
living
with
a
poor
dairyman
among
the
beasts
the
lawyer
said
to
himself
the
moral
of
all
this
is
that
a
pretty
woman
will
never
acknowledge
as
her
husband
nor
even
as
a
lover
a
man
in
an
old
a
tow
wig
and
boots
with
holes
in
a
mischievous
and
bitter
smile
expressed
the
feelings
half
philosophical
and
half
satirical
which
such
a
man
was
certain
to
experience
a
man
well
situated
to
know
the
truth
of
things
in
spite
of
the
lies
behind
which
most
families
in
paris
hide
their
mode
of
life
monsieur
derville
said
she
giving
the
monkey
some
coffee
to
drink
madame
said
he
a
little
sharply
for
the
light
tone
in
which
she
spoke
jarred
on
him
i
have
come
to
speak
with
you
on
a
very
serious
i
am
so
le
comte
is
away
i
madame
am
delighted
it
would
be
grievous
if
he
could
be
present
at
our
interview
besides
i
am
informed
through
delbecq
that
you
like
to
manage
your
own
business
without
troubling
the
then
i
will
send
for
delbecq
said
she
he
would
be
of
no
use
to
you
clever
as
he
is
replied
derville
listen
to
me
madame
one
word
will
be
enough
to
make
you
grave
colonel
chabert
is
alive
is
it
by
telling
me
such
nonsense
as
that
that
you
think
you
can
make
me
grave
said
she
with
a
shout
of
laughter
but
she
was
suddenly
quelled
by
the
singular
penetration
of
the
fixed
gaze
which
derville
turned
on
her
seeming
to
read
to
the
bottom
of
her
soul
madame
he
said
with
cold
and
piercing
solemnity
you
know
not
the
extent
of
the
danger
that
threatens
you
i
need
say
nothing
of
the
indisputable
authenticity
of
the
evidence
nor
of
the
fulness
of
proof
which
testifies
to
the
identity
of
comte
chabert
i
am
not
as
you
know
the
man
to
take
up
a
bad
cause
if
you
resist
our
proceedings
to
show
that
the
certificate
of
death
was
false
you
will
lose
that
first
case
and
that
matter
once
settled
we
shall
gain
every
what
then
do
you
wish
to
discuss
with
me
neither
the
colonel
nor
yourself
nor
need
i
allude
to
the
briefs
which
clever
advocates
may
draw
up
when
armed
with
the
curious
facts
of
this
case
or
the
advantage
they
may
derive
from
the
letters
you
received
from
your
first
husband
before
your
marriage
to
your
it
is
false
she
cried
with
the
violence
of
a
spoilt
woman
i
never
had
a
letter
from
comte
chabert
and
if
some
one
is
pretending
to
be
the
colonel
it
is
some
swindler
some
returned
convict
like
coignard
perhaps
it
makes
me
shudder
only
to
think
of
it
can
the
colonel
rise
from
the
dead
monsieur
bonaparte
sent
an
to
inquire
for
me
on
his
death
and
to
this
day
i
draw
the
pension
of
three
thousand
francs
granted
to
this
widow
by
the
government
i
have
been
perfectly
in
the
right
to
turn
away
all
the
chaberts
who
have
ever
come
as
i
shall
all
who
may
happily
we
are
alone
madame
we
can
tell
lies
at
our
ease
said
he
coolly
and
finding
it
amusing
to
lash
up
the
countess
rage
so
as
to
lead
her
to
betray
herself
by
tactics
familiar
to
lawyers
who
are
accustomed
to
keep
cool
when
their
opponents
or
their
clients
are
in
a
passion
well
then
we
must
fight
it
out
thought
he
instantly
hitting
on
a
plan
to
entrap
her
and
show
her
her
weakness
the
proof
that
you
received
the
first
letter
madame
is
that
it
contained
some
securities
oh
as
to
securities
that
it
certainly
did
then
you
received
the
letter
said
derville
smiling
you
are
caught
madame
in
the
first
snare
laid
for
you
by
an
attorney
and
you
fancy
you
could
fight
against
justice
the
countess
colored
and
then
turned
pale
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
then
she
shook
off
her
shame
and
retorted
with
the
natural
impertinence
of
such
women
since
you
are
the
chabert
s
attorney
be
so
good
as
to
madame
said
derville
i
am
at
this
moment
as
much
your
lawyer
as
i
am
colonel
chabert
s
do
you
suppose
i
want
to
lose
so
valuable
a
client
as
you
are
but
you
are
not
nay
speak
on
monsieur
said
she
graciously
your
fortune
came
to
you
from
le
comte
chabert
and
you
cast
him
off
your
fortune
is
immense
and
you
leave
him
to
beg
an
advocate
can
be
very
eloquent
when
a
cause
is
eloquent
in
itself
there
are
here
circumstances
which
might
turn
public
opinion
strongly
against
but
monsieur
said
the
comtesse
provoked
by
the
way
in
which
derville
turned
and
laid
her
on
the
gridiron
even
if
i
grant
that
your
chabert
is
living
the
law
will
uphold
my
second
marriage
on
account
of
the
children
and
i
shall
get
off
with
the
restitution
of
two
hundred
and
thousand
francs
to
it
is
impossible
to
foresee
what
view
the
bench
may
take
of
the
question
if
on
one
side
we
have
a
mother
and
children
on
the
other
we
have
an
old
man
crushed
by
sorrows
made
old
by
your
refusals
to
know
him
where
is
he
to
find
a
wife
can
the
judges
contravene
the
law
your
marriage
with
colonel
chabert
has
priority
on
its
side
and
every
legal
right
but
if
you
appear
under
disgraceful
colors
you
might
have
an
adversary
that
madame
is
the
danger
against
which
i
would
warn
and
who
is
he
comte
monsieur
ferraud
has
too
great
an
affection
for
me
too
much
respect
for
the
mother
of
his
children
do
not
talk
of
such
absurd
things
interrupted
derville
to
lawyers
who
are
accustomed
to
read
hearts
to
the
bottom
at
this
instant
monsieur
ferraud
has
not
the
slightest
wish
to
annual
your
union
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
he
adores
you
but
if
some
one
were
to
tell
him
that
his
marriage
is
void
that
his
wife
will
be
called
before
the
bar
of
public
opinion
as
a
criminal
he
would
defend
me
no
what
reason
could
he
have
for
deserting
me
monsieur
that
he
would
be
free
to
marry
the
only
daughter
of
a
peer
of
france
whose
title
would
be
conferred
on
him
by
patent
from
the
the
countess
turned
pale
a
hit
said
derville
to
himself
i
have
you
on
the
hip
the
poor
colonel
s
case
is
besides
madame
he
went
on
aloud
he
would
feel
all
the
less
remorse
because
a
man
covered
with
glory
a
general
count
grand
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
is
not
such
a
bad
alternative
and
if
that
man
insisted
on
his
wife
s
returning
to
him
enough
enough
monsieur
she
exclaimed
i
will
never
have
any
lawyer
but
you
what
is
to
be
done
compromise
said
derville
does
he
still
love
me
she
said
well
i
do
not
think
he
can
do
the
countess
raised
her
head
at
these
words
a
flash
of
hope
shone
in
her
eyes
she
thought
perhaps
that
she
could
speculate
on
her
first
husband
s
affection
to
gain
her
cause
by
some
feminine
cunning
i
shall
await
your
orders
madame
to
know
whether
i
am
to
report
our
proceedings
to
you
or
if
you
will
come
to
my
office
to
agree
to
the
terms
of
a
compromise
said
derville
taking
leave
a
week
after
derville
had
paid
these
two
visits
on
a
fine
morning
in
june
the
husband
and
wife
who
had
been
separated
by
an
almost
supernatural
chance
started
from
the
opposite
ends
of
paris
to
meet
in
the
office
of
the
lawyer
who
was
engaged
by
both
the
supplies
liberally
advanced
by
derville
to
colonel
chabert
had
enabled
him
to
dress
as
suited
his
position
in
life
and
the
dead
man
arrived
in
a
very
decent
cab
he
wore
a
wig
suited
to
his
face
was
dressed
in
blue
cloth
with
white
linen
and
wore
under
his
waistcoat
the
broad
red
ribbon
of
the
higher
grade
of
the
legion
of
honor
in
resuming
the
habits
of
wealth
he
had
recovered
his
soldierly
style
he
held
himself
up
his
face
grave
and
reflected
his
happiness
and
all
his
hopes
and
seemed
to
have
acquired
youth
and
to
borrow
a
picturesque
word
from
the
painter
s
art
he
was
no
more
like
the
chabert
of
the
old
than
a
cartwheel
double
sou
is
like
a
newly
coined
piece
the
only
to
see
him
would
have
recognized
at
once
one
of
the
noble
wrecks
of
our
old
army
one
of
the
heroic
men
on
whom
our
national
glory
is
reflected
as
a
splinter
of
ice
on
which
the
sun
shines
seems
to
reflect
every
beam
these
veterans
are
at
once
a
picture
and
a
book
when
the
count
jumped
out
of
his
carriage
to
go
into
derville
s
office
he
did
it
as
lightly
as
a
young
man
hardly
had
his
cab
moved
off
when
a
smart
brougham
drove
up
splendid
with
madame
la
comtesse
ferraud
stepped
out
in
a
dress
which
though
simple
was
cleverly
designed
to
show
how
youthful
her
figure
was
she
wore
a
pretty
drawn
bonnet
lined
with
pink
which
framed
her
face
to
perfection
softening
its
outlines
and
making
it
look
younger
if
the
clients
were
rejuvenescent
the
office
was
unaltered
and
presented
the
same
picture
as
that
described
at
the
beginning
of
this
story
simonnin
was
eating
his
breakfast
his
shoulder
leaning
against
the
window
which
was
then
open
and
he
was
staring
up
at
the
blue
sky
in
the
opening
of
the
courtyard
enclosed
by
four
gloomy
houses
ah
ha
cried
the
little
clerk
who
will
bet
an
evening
at
the
play
that
colonel
chabert
is
a
general
and
wears
a
red
ribbon
the
chief
is
a
great
magician
said
godeschal
then
there
is
no
trick
to
play
on
him
this
time
asked
desroches
his
wife
has
taken
that
in
hand
the
comtesse
ferraud
said
boucard
what
next
said
godeschal
is
comtesse
ferraud
required
to
belong
to
two
men
here
she
is
answered
simonnin
so
you
are
not
deaf
you
young
rogue
said
chabert
taking
the
by
the
ear
and
twisting
it
to
the
delight
of
the
other
clerks
who
began
to
laugh
looking
at
the
colonel
with
the
curious
attention
due
to
so
singular
a
personage
comte
chabert
was
in
derville
s
private
room
at
the
moment
when
his
wife
came
in
by
the
door
of
the
office
i
say
boucard
there
is
going
to
be
a
queer
scene
in
the
chief
s
room
there
is
a
woman
who
can
spend
her
days
alternately
the
odd
with
comte
ferraud
and
the
even
with
comte
and
in
leap
year
said
godeschal
they
must
settle
the
between
silence
gentlemen
you
can
be
heard
said
boucard
severely
i
never
was
in
an
office
where
there
was
so
much
jesting
as
there
is
here
over
the
derville
had
made
the
colonel
retire
to
the
bedroom
when
the
countess
was
admitted
madame
he
said
not
knowing
whether
it
would
be
agreeable
to
you
to
meet
le
comte
chabert
i
have
placed
you
apart
if
however
you
should
wish
it
it
is
an
attention
for
which
i
am
obliged
to
i
have
drawn
up
the
memorandum
of
an
agreement
of
which
you
and
chabert
can
discuss
the
conditions
here
and
now
i
will
go
alternately
to
him
and
to
you
and
explain
your
views
let
me
see
monsieur
said
the
countess
impatiently
derville
read
aloud
between
the
undersigned
m
hyacinthe
chabert
count
marechal
de
camp
and
grand
officer
of
the
legion
of
honor
living
in
paris
rue
du
on
the
one
part
and
madame
rose
chapotel
wife
of
the
aforesaid
le
comte
chabert
pass
over
the
preliminaries
said
she
come
to
the
madame
said
the
lawyer
the
preamble
briefly
sets
forth
the
position
in
which
you
stand
to
each
other
then
by
the
first
clause
you
acknowledge
in
the
presence
of
three
witnesses
of
whom
two
shall
be
notaries
and
one
the
dairyman
with
whom
your
husband
has
been
lodging
to
all
of
whom
your
secret
is
known
and
who
will
be
absolutely
silent
you
acknowledge
i
say
that
the
individual
designated
in
the
documents
subjoined
to
the
deed
and
whose
identity
is
to
be
further
proved
by
an
act
of
recognition
prepared
by
your
notary
alexandre
crottat
is
your
first
husband
comte
chabert
by
the
second
clause
comte
chabert
to
secure
your
happiness
will
undertake
to
assert
his
rights
only
under
certain
circumstances
set
forth
in
the
and
these
said
derville
in
a
parenthesis
are
none
other
than
a
failure
to
carry
out
the
conditions
of
this
secret
m
chabert
on
his
part
agrees
to
accept
judgment
on
a
friendly
suit
by
which
his
certificate
of
death
shall
be
annulled
and
his
marriage
that
will
not
suit
me
in
the
least
said
the
countess
with
surprise
i
will
be
a
party
to
no
suit
you
know
by
the
third
clause
derville
went
on
with
imperturbable
coolness
you
pledge
yourself
to
secure
to
hyacinthe
comte
chabert
an
income
of
thousand
francs
on
government
stock
held
in
his
name
to
revert
to
you
at
his
death
but
it
is
much
too
dear
exclaimed
the
countess
can
you
compromise
the
matter
cheaper
but
what
do
you
want
madame
i
want
i
will
not
have
a
lawsuit
i
want
you
want
him
to
remain
dead
said
derville
interrupting
her
hastily
monsieur
said
the
countess
if
thousand
francs
a
year
are
necessary
we
will
go
to
law
yes
we
will
go
to
law
said
the
colonel
in
a
deep
voice
as
he
opened
the
door
and
stood
before
his
wife
with
one
hand
in
his
waistcoat
and
the
other
hanging
by
his
side
an
attitude
to
which
the
recollection
of
his
adventure
gave
horrible
significance
it
is
he
said
the
countess
to
herself
too
dear
the
old
soldier
exclaimed
i
have
given
you
near
on
a
million
and
you
are
cheapening
my
misfortunes
very
well
now
i
will
have
you
you
and
your
fortune
our
goods
are
in
common
our
marriage
is
not
dissolved
but
monsieur
is
not
colonel
chabert
cried
the
countess
in
feigned
amazement
indeed
said
the
old
man
in
a
tone
of
intense
irony
do
you
want
proofs
i
found
you
in
the
palais
royal
the
countess
turned
pale
seeing
her
grow
white
under
her
rouge
the
old
soldier
paused
touched
by
the
acute
suffering
he
was
inflicting
on
the
woman
he
had
once
so
ardently
loved
but
she
shot
such
a
venomous
glance
at
him
that
he
abruptly
went
on
you
were
with
la
allow
me
monsieur
derville
said
the
countess
to
the
lawyer
you
must
give
me
leave
to
retire
i
did
not
come
here
to
listen
to
such
dreadful
she
rose
and
went
out
derville
rushed
after
her
but
the
countess
had
taken
wings
and
seemed
to
have
flown
from
the
place
on
returning
to
his
private
room
he
found
the
colonel
in
a
towering
rage
striding
up
and
down
in
those
times
a
man
took
his
wife
where
he
chose
said
he
but
i
was
foolish
and
chose
badly
i
trusted
to
appearances
she
has
no
well
colonel
was
i
not
right
to
beg
you
not
to
come
i
am
now
positive
of
your
identity
when
you
came
in
the
countess
gave
a
little
start
of
which
the
meaning
was
unequivocal
but
you
have
lost
your
chances
your
wife
knows
that
you
are
i
will
kill
her
madness
you
will
be
caught
and
executed
like
any
common
wretch
besides
you
might
miss
that
would
be
unpardonable
a
man
must
not
miss
his
shot
when
he
wants
to
kill
his
let
me
set
things
straight
you
are
only
a
big
child
go
now
take
care
of
yourself
she
is
capable
of
setting
some
trap
for
you
and
shutting
you
up
in
charenton
i
will
notify
her
of
our
proceedings
to
protect
you
against
a
the
unhappy
colonel
obeyed
his
young
benefactor
and
went
away
stammering
apologies
he
slowly
went
down
the
dark
staircase
lost
in
gloomy
thoughts
and
crushed
perhaps
by
the
blow
just
dealt
him
the
most
cruel
he
could
feel
the
thrust
that
could
most
deeply
pierce
his
heart
when
he
heard
the
rustle
of
a
woman
s
dress
on
the
lowest
landing
and
his
wife
stood
before
him
come
monsieur
said
she
taking
his
arm
with
a
gesture
like
those
familiar
to
him
of
old
her
action
and
the
accent
of
her
voice
which
had
recovered
its
graciousness
were
enough
to
allay
the
colonel
s
wrath
and
he
allowed
himself
to
be
led
to
the
carriage
well
get
in
said
she
when
the
footman
had
let
down
the
step
and
as
if
by
magic
he
found
himself
sitting
by
his
wife
in
the
brougham
where
to
asked
the
servant
to
groslay
said
she
the
horses
started
at
once
and
carried
them
all
across
paris
monsieur
said
the
countess
in
a
tone
of
voice
which
betrayed
one
of
those
emotions
which
are
rare
in
our
lives
and
which
agitate
every
part
of
our
being
at
such
moments
the
heart
fibres
nerves
countenance
soul
and
body
everything
every
pore
even
feels
a
thrill
life
no
longer
seems
to
be
within
us
it
flows
out
springs
forth
is
communicated
as
if
by
contagion
transmitted
by
a
look
a
tone
of
voice
a
gesture
impressing
our
will
on
others
the
old
soldier
started
on
hearing
this
single
word
this
first
terrible
monsieur
but
still
it
was
at
once
a
reproach
and
a
pardon
a
hope
and
a
despair
a
question
and
an
answer
this
word
included
them
all
none
but
an
actress
could
have
thrown
so
much
eloquence
so
many
feelings
into
a
single
word
truth
is
less
complete
in
its
utterance
it
does
not
put
everything
on
the
outside
it
allows
us
to
see
what
is
within
the
colonel
was
filled
with
remorse
for
his
suspicions
his
demands
and
his
anger
he
looked
down
not
to
betray
his
agitation
monsieur
repeated
she
after
an
imperceptible
pause
i
knew
you
at
rosine
said
the
old
soldier
those
words
contain
the
only
balm
that
can
help
me
to
forget
my
two
large
tears
rolled
hot
on
to
his
wife
s
hands
which
he
pressed
to
show
his
paternal
affection
monsieur
she
went
on
could
you
not
have
guessed
what
it
cost
me
to
appear
before
a
stranger
in
a
position
so
false
as
mine
now
is
if
i
have
to
blush
for
it
at
least
let
it
be
in
the
privacy
of
my
family
ought
not
such
a
secret
to
remain
buried
in
our
hearts
you
will
forgive
me
i
hope
for
my
apparent
indifference
to
the
woes
of
a
chabert
in
whose
existence
i
could
not
possibly
believe
i
received
your
letters
she
hastily
added
seeing
in
his
face
the
objection
it
expressed
but
they
did
not
reach
me
till
thirteen
months
after
the
battle
of
eylau
they
were
opened
dirty
the
writing
was
unrecognizable
and
after
obtaining
napoleon
s
signature
to
my
second
marriage
contract
i
could
not
help
believing
that
some
clever
swindler
wanted
to
make
a
fool
of
me
therefore
to
avoid
disturbing
monsieur
ferraud
s
peace
of
mind
and
disturbing
family
ties
i
was
obliged
to
take
precautions
against
a
pretended
chabert
was
i
not
right
i
ask
you
yes
you
were
right
it
was
i
who
was
the
idiot
the
owl
the
dolt
not
to
have
calculated
better
what
the
consequences
of
such
a
position
might
but
where
are
we
going
he
asked
seeing
that
they
had
reached
the
barrier
of
la
chapelle
to
my
country
house
near
groslay
in
the
valley
of
montmorency
there
monsieur
we
will
consider
the
steps
to
be
taken
i
know
my
duties
though
i
am
yours
by
right
i
am
no
longer
yours
in
fact
can
you
wish
that
we
should
become
the
talk
of
paris
we
need
not
inform
the
public
of
a
situation
which
for
me
has
its
ridiculous
side
and
let
us
preserve
our
dignity
you
still
love
me
she
said
with
a
sad
sweet
gaze
at
the
colonel
but
have
not
i
been
authorized
to
form
other
ties
in
so
strange
a
position
a
secret
voice
bids
me
trust
to
your
kindness
which
is
so
well
known
to
me
can
i
be
wrong
in
taking
you
as
the
sole
arbiter
of
my
fate
be
at
once
judge
and
party
to
the
suit
i
trust
in
your
noble
character
you
will
be
generous
enough
to
forgive
me
for
the
consequences
of
faults
committed
in
innocence
i
may
then
confess
to
you
i
love
ferraud
i
believed
that
i
had
a
right
to
love
him
i
do
not
blush
to
make
this
confession
to
you
even
if
it
offends
you
it
does
not
disgrace
us
i
can
not
conceal
the
facts
when
fate
made
me
a
widow
i
was
not
a
the
colonel
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
bid
his
wife
be
silent
and
for
a
mile
and
a
half
they
sat
without
speaking
a
single
word
chabert
could
fancy
he
saw
the
two
little
ones
before
him
monsieur
the
dead
are
very
wrong
to
come
to
life
oh
monsieur
no
no
do
not
think
me
ungrateful
only
you
find
me
a
lover
a
mother
while
you
left
me
merely
a
wife
though
it
is
no
longer
in
my
power
to
love
i
know
how
much
i
owe
you
and
i
can
still
offer
you
all
the
affection
of
a
rosine
said
the
old
man
in
a
softened
tone
i
no
longer
feel
any
resentment
against
you
we
will
forget
anything
he
added
with
one
of
those
smiles
which
always
reflect
a
noble
soul
i
have
not
so
little
delicacy
as
to
demand
the
mockery
of
love
from
a
wife
who
no
longer
loves
the
countess
gave
him
a
flashing
look
full
of
such
deep
gratitude
that
poor
chabert
would
have
been
glad
to
sink
again
into
his
grave
at
eylau
some
men
have
a
soul
strong
enough
for
such
of
which
the
whole
reward
consists
in
the
assurance
that
they
have
made
the
person
they
love
happy
my
dear
friend
we
will
talk
all
this
over
later
when
our
hearts
have
rested
said
the
countess
the
conversation
turned
to
other
subjects
for
it
was
impossible
to
dwell
very
long
on
this
one
though
the
couple
came
back
again
and
again
to
their
singular
position
either
by
some
allusion
or
of
serious
purpose
they
had
a
delightful
drive
recalling
the
events
of
their
former
life
together
and
the
times
of
the
empire
the
countess
knew
how
to
lend
peculiar
charm
to
her
reminiscences
and
gave
the
conversation
the
tinge
of
melancholy
that
was
needed
to
keep
it
serious
she
revived
his
love
without
awakening
his
desires
and
allowed
her
first
husband
to
discern
the
mental
wealth
she
had
acquired
while
trying
to
accustom
him
to
moderate
his
pleasure
to
that
which
a
father
may
feel
in
the
society
of
a
favorite
daughter
the
colonel
had
known
the
countess
of
the
empire
he
found
her
a
countess
of
the
restoration
at
last
by
a
they
arrived
at
the
entrance
to
a
large
park
lying
in
the
little
valley
which
divides
the
heights
of
margency
from
the
pretty
village
of
groslay
the
countess
had
there
a
delightful
house
where
the
colonel
on
arriving
found
everything
in
readiness
for
his
stay
there
as
well
as
for
his
wife
s
misfortune
is
a
kind
of
talisman
whose
virtue
consists
in
its
power
to
confirm
our
original
nature
in
some
men
it
increases
their
distrust
and
malignancy
just
as
it
improves
the
goodness
of
those
who
have
a
kind
heart
sorrow
had
made
the
colonel
even
more
helpful
and
good
than
he
had
always
been
and
he
could
understand
some
secrets
of
womanly
distress
which
are
unrevealed
to
most
men
nevertheless
in
spite
of
his
loyal
trustfulness
he
could
not
help
saying
to
his
wife
then
you
felt
quite
sure
you
would
bring
me
here
yes
replied
she
if
i
found
colonel
chabert
in
derville
s
the
appearance
of
truth
she
contrived
to
give
to
this
answer
dissipated
the
slight
suspicions
which
the
colonel
was
ashamed
to
have
felt
for
three
days
the
countess
was
quite
charming
to
her
first
husband
by
tender
attentions
and
unfailing
sweetness
she
seemed
anxious
to
wipe
out
the
memory
of
the
sufferings
he
had
endured
and
to
earn
forgiveness
for
the
woes
which
as
she
confessed
she
had
innocently
caused
him
she
delighted
in
displaying
for
him
the
charms
she
knew
he
took
pleasure
in
while
at
the
same
time
she
assumed
a
kind
of
melancholy
for
men
are
more
especially
accessible
to
certain
ways
certain
graces
of
the
heart
or
of
the
mind
which
they
can
not
resist
she
aimed
at
interesting
him
in
her
position
and
appealing
to
his
feelings
so
far
as
to
take
possession
of
his
mind
and
control
him
despotically
ready
for
anything
to
attain
her
ends
she
did
not
yet
know
what
she
was
to
do
with
this
man
but
at
any
rate
she
meant
to
annihilate
him
socially
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
she
felt
that
in
spite
of
her
efforts
she
could
not
conceal
her
uneasiness
as
to
the
results
of
her
manoeuvres
to
give
herself
a
minute
s
reprieve
she
went
up
to
her
room
sat
down
before
her
and
laid
aside
the
mask
of
composure
which
she
wore
in
chabert
s
presence
like
an
actress
who
returning
to
her
after
a
fatiguing
fifth
act
drops
half
dead
leaving
with
the
audience
an
image
of
herself
which
she
no
longer
resembles
she
proceeded
to
finish
a
letter
she
had
begun
to
delbecq
whom
she
desired
to
go
in
her
name
and
demand
of
derville
the
deeds
relating
to
colonel
chabert
to
copy
them
and
to
come
to
her
at
once
to
groslay
she
had
hardly
finished
when
she
heard
the
colonel
s
step
in
the
passage
uneasy
at
her
absence
he
had
come
to
look
for
her
alas
she
exclaimed
i
wish
i
were
dead
my
position
is
intolerable
why
what
is
the
matter
asked
the
good
man
nothing
nothing
she
replied
she
rose
left
the
colonel
and
went
down
to
speak
privately
to
her
maid
whom
she
sent
off
to
paris
impressing
on
her
that
she
was
herself
to
deliver
to
delbecq
the
letter
just
written
and
to
bring
it
back
to
the
writer
as
soon
as
he
had
read
it
then
the
countess
went
out
to
sit
on
a
bench
sufficiently
in
sight
for
the
colonel
to
join
her
as
soon
as
he
might
choose
the
colonel
who
was
looking
for
her
hastened
up
and
sat
down
by
her
rosine
said
he
what
is
the
matter
with
you
she
did
not
answer
it
was
one
of
those
glorious
calm
evenings
in
the
month
of
june
whose
secret
harmonies
infuse
such
sweetness
into
the
sunset
the
air
was
clear
the
stillness
perfect
so
that
far
away
in
the
park
they
could
hear
the
voices
of
some
children
which
added
a
kind
of
melody
to
the
sublimity
of
the
scene
you
do
not
answer
me
the
colonel
said
to
his
wife
my
husband
said
the
countess
who
broke
off
started
a
little
and
with
a
blush
stopped
to
ask
him
what
am
i
to
say
when
i
speak
of
ferraud
call
him
your
husband
my
poor
child
replied
the
colonel
in
a
kind
voice
is
he
not
the
father
of
your
children
well
then
she
said
if
he
should
ask
what
i
came
here
for
if
he
finds
out
that
i
came
here
alone
with
a
stranger
what
am
i
to
say
to
him
listen
monsieur
she
went
on
assuming
a
dignified
attitude
decide
my
fate
i
am
resigned
to
anything
my
dear
said
the
colonel
taking
possession
of
his
wife
s
hands
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
sacrifice
myself
entirely
for
your
happiness
that
is
impossible
she
exclaimed
with
a
sudden
spasmodic
movement
remember
that
you
would
have
to
renounce
your
identity
and
in
an
authenticated
what
said
the
colonel
is
not
my
word
enough
for
you
the
word
authenticated
fell
on
the
old
man
s
heart
and
roused
involuntary
distrust
he
looked
at
his
wife
in
a
way
that
made
her
color
she
cast
down
her
eyes
and
he
feared
that
he
might
find
himself
compelled
to
despise
her
the
countess
was
afraid
lest
she
had
scared
the
shy
modesty
the
stern
honesty
of
a
man
whose
generous
temper
and
primitive
virtues
were
known
to
her
though
these
feelings
had
brought
the
clouds
to
her
brow
they
immediately
recovered
their
harmony
this
was
the
way
of
it
a
child
s
cry
was
heard
in
the
distance
jules
leave
your
sister
in
peace
the
countess
called
out
what
are
your
children
here
said
chabert
yes
but
i
told
them
not
to
trouble
the
old
soldier
understood
the
delicacy
the
womanly
tact
of
so
gracious
a
precaution
and
took
the
countess
hand
to
kiss
it
but
let
them
come
said
he
the
little
girl
ran
up
to
complain
of
her
brother
mamma
mamma
it
was
jules
it
was
her
their
little
hands
were
held
out
to
their
mother
and
the
two
childish
voices
mingled
it
was
an
unexpected
and
charming
picture
poor
little
things
cried
the
countess
no
longer
restraining
her
tears
i
shall
have
to
leave
them
to
whom
will
the
law
assign
them
a
mother
s
heart
can
not
be
divided
i
want
them
i
want
are
you
making
mamma
cry
said
jules
looking
fiercely
at
the
colonel
silence
jules
said
the
mother
in
a
decided
tone
the
two
children
stood
speechless
examining
their
mother
and
the
stranger
with
a
curiosity
which
it
is
impossible
to
express
in
words
oh
yes
she
cried
if
i
am
separated
from
the
count
only
leave
me
my
children
and
i
will
submit
to
anything
this
was
the
decisive
speech
which
gained
all
that
she
had
hoped
from
it
yes
exclaimed
the
colonel
as
if
he
were
ending
a
sentence
already
begun
in
his
mind
i
must
return
underground
again
i
had
told
myself
so
can
i
accept
such
a
sacrifice
replied
his
wife
if
some
men
have
died
to
save
a
mistress
honor
they
gave
their
life
but
once
but
in
this
case
you
would
be
giving
your
life
every
day
no
no
it
is
impossible
if
it
were
only
your
life
it
would
be
nothing
but
to
sign
a
declaration
that
you
are
not
colonel
chabert
to
acknowledge
yourself
an
imposter
to
sacrifice
your
honor
and
live
a
lie
every
hour
of
the
day
human
devotion
can
not
go
so
far
only
think
no
but
for
my
poor
children
i
would
have
fled
with
you
by
this
time
to
the
other
end
of
the
but
said
chabert
can
not
i
live
here
in
your
little
lodge
as
one
of
your
relations
i
am
as
worn
out
as
a
cracked
cannon
i
want
nothing
but
a
little
tobacco
and
the
the
countess
melted
into
tears
there
was
a
contest
of
generosity
between
the
comtesse
ferraud
and
colonel
chabert
and
the
soldier
came
out
victorious
one
evening
seeing
this
mother
with
her
children
the
soldier
was
bewitched
by
the
touching
grace
of
a
family
picture
in
the
country
in
the
shade
and
the
silence
he
made
a
resolution
to
remain
dead
and
frightened
no
longer
at
the
authentication
of
a
deed
he
asked
what
he
could
do
to
secure
beyond
all
risk
the
happiness
of
this
family
do
exactly
as
you
like
said
the
countess
i
declare
to
you
that
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
affair
i
ought
delbecq
had
arrived
some
days
before
and
in
obedience
to
the
countess
verbal
instructions
the
intendant
had
succeeded
in
gaining
the
old
soldier
s
confidence
so
on
the
following
morning
colonel
chabert
went
with
the
erewhile
attorney
to
where
delbecq
had
caused
the
notary
to
draw
up
an
affidavit
in
such
terms
that
after
hearing
it
read
the
colonel
started
up
and
walked
out
of
the
office
turf
and
thunder
what
a
fool
you
must
think
me
why
i
should
make
myself
out
a
swindler
he
exclaimed
indeed
monsieur
said
delbecq
i
should
advise
you
not
to
sign
in
haste
in
your
place
i
would
get
at
least
thirty
thousand
francs
a
year
out
of
the
bargain
madame
would
pay
after
annihilating
this
scoundrel
by
the
lightning
look
of
an
honest
man
insulted
the
colonel
rushed
off
carried
away
by
a
thousand
contrary
emotions
he
was
suspicious
indignant
and
calm
again
by
turns
finally
he
made
his
way
back
into
the
park
of
groslay
by
a
gap
in
a
fence
and
slowly
walked
on
to
sit
down
and
rest
and
meditate
at
his
ease
in
a
little
room
under
a
gazebo
from
which
the
road
to
could
be
seen
the
path
being
strewn
with
the
yellowish
sand
which
is
used
instead
of
the
countess
who
was
sitting
in
the
upper
room
of
this
little
did
not
hear
the
colonel
s
approach
for
she
was
too
much
preoccupied
with
the
success
of
her
business
to
pay
the
smallest
attention
to
the
slight
noise
made
by
her
husband
nor
did
the
old
man
notice
that
his
wife
was
in
the
room
over
him
well
monsieur
delbecq
has
he
signed
the
countess
asked
her
secretary
whom
she
saw
alone
on
the
road
beyond
the
hedge
of
a
haha
no
madame
i
do
not
even
know
what
has
become
of
our
man
the
old
horse
then
we
shall
be
obliged
to
put
him
into
charenton
said
she
since
we
have
got
the
colonel
who
recovered
the
elasticity
of
youth
to
leap
the
haha
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
was
standing
in
front
of
delbecq
on
whom
he
bestowed
the
two
finest
slaps
that
ever
a
scoundrel
s
cheeks
received
and
you
may
add
that
old
horses
can
kick
said
he
his
rage
spent
the
colonel
no
longer
felt
vigorous
enough
to
leap
the
ditch
he
had
seen
the
truth
in
all
its
nakedness
the
countess
speech
and
delbecq
s
reply
had
revealed
the
conspiracy
of
which
he
was
to
be
the
victim
the
care
taken
of
him
was
but
a
bait
to
entrap
him
in
a
snare
that
speech
was
like
a
drop
of
subtle
poison
bringing
on
in
the
old
soldier
a
return
of
all
his
sufferings
physical
and
moral
he
came
back
to
the
through
the
park
gate
walking
slowly
like
a
broken
man
then
for
him
there
was
to
be
neither
peace
nor
truce
from
this
moment
he
must
begin
the
odious
warfare
with
this
woman
of
which
derville
had
spoken
enter
on
a
life
of
litigation
feed
on
gall
drink
every
morning
of
the
cup
of
bitterness
and
then
fearful
thought
where
was
he
to
find
the
money
needful
to
pay
the
cost
of
the
first
proceedings
he
felt
such
disgust
of
life
that
if
there
had
been
any
water
at
hand
he
would
have
thrown
himself
into
it
that
if
he
had
had
a
pistol
he
would
have
blown
out
his
brains
then
he
relapsed
into
the
indecision
of
mind
which
since
his
conversation
with
derville
at
the
dairyman
s
had
changed
his
character
at
last
having
reached
the
kiosque
he
went
up
to
the
gazebo
where
little
afforded
a
view
over
each
lovely
landscape
of
the
valley
and
where
he
found
his
wife
seated
on
a
chair
the
countess
was
gazing
at
the
distance
and
preserved
a
calm
countenance
showing
that
impenetrable
face
which
women
can
assume
when
resolved
to
do
their
worst
she
wiped
her
eyes
as
if
she
had
been
weeping
and
played
absently
with
the
pink
ribbons
of
her
sash
nevertheless
in
spite
of
her
apparent
assurance
she
could
not
help
shuddering
slightly
when
she
saw
before
her
her
venerable
benefactor
standing
with
folded
arms
his
face
pale
his
brow
stern
madame
he
said
after
gazing
at
her
fixedly
for
a
moment
and
compelling
her
to
blush
madame
i
do
not
curse
you
i
scorn
you
i
can
now
thank
the
chance
that
has
divided
us
i
do
not
feel
even
a
desire
for
revenge
i
no
longer
love
you
i
want
nothing
from
you
live
in
peace
on
the
strength
of
my
word
it
is
worth
more
than
the
scrawl
of
all
the
notaries
in
paris
i
will
never
assert
my
claim
to
the
name
i
perhaps
have
made
illustrious
i
am
henceforth
but
a
poor
devil
named
hyacinthe
who
asks
no
more
than
his
share
of
the
farewell
the
countess
threw
herself
at
his
feet
she
would
have
detained
him
by
taking
his
hands
but
he
pushed
her
away
with
disgust
saying
do
not
touch
me
the
countess
expression
when
she
heard
her
husband
s
retreating
steps
is
quite
indescribable
then
with
the
deep
perspicacity
given
only
by
utter
villainy
or
by
fierce
worldly
selfishness
she
knew
that
she
might
live
in
peace
on
the
word
and
the
contempt
of
this
loyal
veteran
chabert
in
fact
disappeared
the
dairyman
failed
in
business
and
became
a
driver
the
colonel
perhaps
took
up
some
similar
industry
for
a
time
perhaps
like
a
stone
flung
into
a
chasm
he
went
falling
from
ledge
to
ledge
to
be
lost
in
the
mire
of
rags
that
seethes
through
the
streets
of
paris
six
months
after
this
event
derville
hearing
no
more
of
colonel
chabert
or
the
comtesse
ferraud
supposed
that
they
had
no
doubt
come
to
a
compromise
which
the
countess
out
of
revenge
had
had
arranged
by
some
other
lawyer
so
one
morning
he
added
up
the
sums
he
had
advanced
to
the
said
chabert
with
the
costs
and
begged
the
comtesse
ferraud
to
claim
from
le
comte
chabert
the
amount
of
the
bill
assuming
that
she
would
know
where
to
find
her
first
husband
the
very
next
day
comte
ferraud
s
man
of
business
lately
appointed
president
of
the
county
court
in
a
town
of
some
importance
wrote
this
distressing
note
to
derville
monsieur
madame
la
comtesse
ferraud
desires
me
to
inform
you
that
your
client
took
complete
advantage
of
your
confidence
and
that
the
individual
calling
himself
comte
chabert
has
acknowledged
that
he
came
forward
under
false
pretences
yours
one
comes
across
people
who
are
on
my
honor
too
stupid
by
half
cried
derville
they
don
t
deserve
to
be
christians
be
humane
generous
philanthropical
and
a
lawyer
and
you
are
bound
to
be
cheated
there
is
a
piece
of
business
that
will
cost
me
two
notes
some
time
after
receiving
this
letter
derville
went
to
the
palais
de
justice
in
search
of
a
pleader
to
whom
he
wished
to
speak
and
who
was
employed
in
the
police
court
as
chance
would
have
it
derville
went
into
court
number
at
the
moment
when
the
presiding
magistrate
was
sentencing
one
hyacinthe
to
two
months
imprisonment
as
a
vagabond
and
subsequently
to
be
taken
to
the
mendicity
house
of
detention
a
sentence
which
by
magistrates
law
is
equivalent
to
perpetual
imprisonment
on
hearing
the
name
of
hyacinthe
derville
looked
at
the
deliquent
sitting
between
two
on
the
bench
for
the
accused
and
recognized
in
the
condemned
man
his
false
colonel
chabert
the
old
soldier
was
placid
motionless
almost
absentminded
in
spite
of
his
rags
in
spite
of
the
misery
stamped
on
his
countenance
it
gave
evidence
of
noble
pride
his
eye
had
a
stoical
expression
which
no
magistrate
ought
to
have
misunderstood
but
as
soon
as
a
man
has
fallen
into
the
hands
of
justice
he
is
no
more
than
a
moral
entity
a
matter
of
law
or
of
fact
just
as
to
statists
he
has
become
a
zero
when
the
veteran
was
taken
back
to
the
to
be
removed
later
with
the
batch
of
vagabonds
at
that
moment
at
the
bar
derville
availed
himself
of
the
privilege
accorded
to
lawyers
of
going
wherever
they
please
in
the
courts
and
followed
him
to
the
where
he
stood
scrutinizing
him
for
some
minutes
as
well
as
the
curious
crew
of
beggars
among
whom
he
found
himself
the
passage
to
the
at
that
moment
afforded
one
of
those
spectacles
which
unfortunately
neither
legislators
nor
philanthropists
nor
painters
nor
writers
come
to
study
like
all
the
laboratories
of
the
law
this
is
a
dark
and
malodorous
place
along
the
walls
runs
a
wooden
seat
blackened
by
the
constant
presence
there
of
the
wretches
who
come
to
this
of
every
form
of
social
squalor
where
not
one
of
them
is
missing
a
poet
might
say
that
the
day
was
ashamed
to
light
up
this
dreadful
sewer
through
which
so
much
misery
flows
there
is
not
a
spot
on
that
plank
where
some
crime
has
not
sat
in
embryo
or
matured
not
a
corner
where
a
man
has
never
stood
who
driven
to
despair
by
the
blight
which
justice
has
set
upon
him
after
his
first
fault
has
not
there
begun
a
career
at
the
end
of
which
looms
the
guillotine
or
the
of
the
suicide
all
who
fall
on
the
pavement
of
paris
rebound
against
these
walls
on
which
a
philanthropist
who
was
not
a
speculator
might
read
a
justification
of
the
numerous
suicides
complained
of
by
hypocritical
writers
who
are
incapable
of
taking
a
step
to
prevent
them
for
that
justification
is
written
in
that
like
a
preface
to
the
dramas
of
the
morgue
or
to
those
enacted
on
the
place
de
la
greve
at
this
moment
colonel
chabert
was
sitting
among
these
men
men
with
coarse
faces
clothed
in
the
horrible
livery
of
misery
and
silent
at
intervals
or
talking
in
a
low
tone
for
three
gendarmes
on
duty
paced
to
and
fro
their
sabres
clattering
on
the
floor
do
you
recognize
me
said
derville
to
the
old
man
standing
in
front
of
him
yes
sir
said
chabert
rising
if
you
are
an
honest
man
derville
went
on
in
an
undertone
how
could
you
remain
in
my
debt
the
old
soldier
blushed
as
a
young
girl
might
when
accused
by
her
mother
of
a
clandestine
love
affair
what
madame
ferraud
has
not
paid
you
cried
he
in
a
loud
voice
paid
me
said
derville
she
wrote
to
me
that
you
were
a
the
colonel
cast
up
his
eyes
in
a
sublime
impulse
of
horror
and
imprecation
as
if
to
call
heaven
to
witness
to
this
fresh
subterfuge
monsieur
said
he
in
a
voice
that
was
calm
by
sheer
huskiness
get
the
gendarmes
to
allow
me
to
go
into
the
and
i
will
sign
an
order
which
will
certainly
be
at
a
word
from
derville
to
the
sergeant
he
was
allowed
to
take
his
client
into
the
room
where
hyacinthe
wrote
a
few
lines
and
addressed
them
to
the
comtesse
ferraud
send
her
that
said
the
soldier
and
you
will
be
paid
your
costs
and
the
money
you
advanced
believe
me
monsieur
if
i
have
not
shown
you
the
gratitude
i
owe
you
for
your
kind
offices
it
is
not
the
less
there
and
he
laid
his
hand
on
his
heart
yes
it
is
there
deep
and
sincere
but
what
can
the
unfortunate
do
they
live
and
that
is
what
said
derville
did
you
not
stipulate
for
an
allowance
do
not
speak
of
it
cried
the
old
man
you
can
not
conceive
how
deep
my
contempt
is
for
the
outside
life
to
which
most
men
cling
i
was
suddenly
attacked
by
a
sickness
disgust
of
humanity
when
i
think
that
napoleon
is
at
everything
on
earth
is
a
matter
of
indifference
to
me
i
can
no
longer
be
a
soldier
that
is
my
only
real
grief
after
all
he
added
with
a
gesture
of
childish
simplicity
it
is
better
to
enjoy
luxury
of
feeling
than
of
dress
for
my
part
i
fear
nobody
s
and
the
colonel
sat
down
on
his
bench
again
derville
went
away
on
returning
to
his
office
he
sent
godeschal
at
that
time
his
second
clerk
to
the
comtesse
ferraud
who
on
reading
the
note
at
once
paid
the
sum
due
to
comte
chabert
s
lawyer
in
towards
the
end
of
june
godeschal
now
himself
an
attorney
went
to
ris
with
derville
to
whom
he
had
succeeded
when
they
reached
the
avenue
leading
from
the
highroad
to
bicetre
they
saw
under
one
of
the
by
the
wayside
one
of
those
old
broken
and
hoary
paupers
who
have
earned
the
marshal
s
staff
among
beggars
by
living
on
at
bicetre
as
poor
women
live
on
at
la
salpetriere
this
man
one
of
the
two
thousand
poor
creatures
who
are
lodged
in
the
infirmary
for
the
aged
was
seated
on
a
and
seemed
to
have
concentrated
all
his
intelligence
on
an
operation
well
known
to
these
pensioners
which
consists
in
drying
their
snuffy
in
the
sun
perhaps
to
save
washing
them
this
old
man
had
an
attractive
countenance
he
was
dressed
in
a
reddish
cloth
which
the
affords
to
its
inmates
a
sort
of
horrible
livery
i
say
derville
said
godeschal
to
his
traveling
companion
look
at
that
old
fellow
isn
t
he
like
those
grotesque
carved
figures
we
get
from
germany
and
it
is
alive
perhaps
it
is
derville
looked
at
the
poor
man
through
his
eyeglass
and
with
a
little
exclamation
of
surprise
he
said
that
old
man
my
dear
fellow
is
a
whole
poem
or
as
the
romantics
say
a
did
you
ever
meet
the
comtesse
ferraud
yes
she
is
a
clever
woman
and
agreeable
but
rather
too
pious
said
godeschal
that
old
bicetre
pauper
is
her
lawful
husband
comte
chabert
the
old
colonel
she
has
had
him
sent
here
no
doubt
and
if
he
is
in
this
workhouse
instead
of
living
in
a
mansion
it
is
solely
because
he
reminded
the
pretty
countess
that
he
had
taken
her
like
a
hackney
cab
on
the
street
i
can
remember
now
the
tiger
s
glare
she
shot
at
him
at
that
this
opening
having
excited
godeschal
s
curiosity
derville
related
the
story
here
told
two
days
later
on
monday
morning
as
they
returned
to
paris
the
two
friends
looked
again
at
bicetre
and
derville
proposed
that
they
should
call
on
colonel
chabert
halfway
up
the
avenue
they
found
the
old
man
sitting
on
the
trunk
of
a
felled
tree
with
his
stick
in
one
hand
he
was
amusing
himself
with
drawing
lines
in
the
sand
on
looking
at
him
narrowly
they
perceived
that
he
had
been
breakfasting
elsewhere
than
at
bicetre
colonel
chabert
said
derville
not
chabert
not
chabert
my
name
is
hyacinthe
replied
the
veteran
i
am
no
longer
a
man
i
am
no
room
he
added
looking
at
derville
with
timid
anxiety
the
fear
of
an
old
man
and
a
are
you
going
to
visit
the
man
condemned
to
death
he
asked
after
a
moment
s
silence
he
is
not
married
he
is
very
lucky
poor
fellow
said
godeschal
would
you
like
something
to
buy
snuff
with
all
the
simplicity
of
a
street
arab
the
colonel
eagerly
held
out
his
hand
to
the
two
strangers
who
each
gave
him
a
piece
he
thanked
them
with
a
puzzled
look
saying
brave
troopers
he
ported
arms
pretended
to
take
aim
at
them
and
shouted
with
a
smile
fire
both
arms
and
he
drew
a
flourish
in
the
air
with
his
stick
the
nature
of
his
wound
has
no
doubt
made
him
childish
said
derville
childish
he
said
another
old
pauper
who
was
looking
on
why
there
are
days
when
you
had
better
not
tread
on
his
corns
he
is
an
old
rogue
full
of
philosophy
and
imagination
but
what
can
you
expect
he
has
had
his
monday
he
was
here
monsieur
so
long
ago
as
at
that
time
a
prussian
officer
whose
chaise
was
crawling
up
the
hill
of
villejuif
came
by
on
foot
we
two
were
together
hyacinthe
and
i
by
the
roadside
the
officer
as
he
walked
was
talking
to
another
a
russian
or
some
animal
of
the
same
species
and
when
the
prussian
saw
the
old
boy
just
to
make
fun
he
said
to
him
here
is
an
old
cavalry
man
who
must
have
been
at
i
was
too
young
to
be
there
said
hyacinthe
but
i
was
at
and
the
prussian
made
off
pretty
quick
without
asking
any
more
what
a
destiny
exclaimed
derville
taken
out
of
the
foundling
hospital
to
die
in
the
infirmary
for
the
aged
after
helping
napoleon
between
whiles
to
conquer
egypt
and
do
you
know
my
dear
fellow
derville
went
on
after
a
pause
there
are
in
modern
society
three
men
who
can
never
think
well
of
the
world
the
priest
the
doctor
and
the
man
of
law
and
they
wear
black
robes
perhaps
because
they
are
in
mourning
for
every
virtue
and
every
illusion
the
most
hapless
of
the
three
is
the
lawyer
when
a
man
comes
in
search
of
the
priest
he
is
prompted
by
repentance
by
remorse
by
beliefs
which
make
him
interesting
which
elevate
him
and
comfort
the
soul
of
the
intercessor
whose
task
will
bring
him
a
sort
of
gladness
he
purifies
repairs
and
reconciles
but
we
lawyers
we
see
the
same
evil
feelings
repeated
again
and
again
nothing
can
correct
them
our
offices
are
sewers
which
can
never
be
cleansed
how
many
things
have
i
learned
in
the
exercise
of
my
profession
i
have
seen
a
father
die
in
a
garret
deserted
by
two
daughters
to
whom
he
had
given
forty
thousand
francs
a
year
i
have
known
wills
burned
i
have
seen
mothers
robbing
their
children
wives
killing
their
husbands
and
working
on
the
love
they
could
inspire
to
make
the
men
idiotic
or
mad
that
they
might
live
in
peace
with
a
lover
i
have
seen
women
teaching
the
child
of
their
marriage
such
tastes
as
must
bring
it
to
the
grave
in
order
to
benefit
the
child
of
an
illicit
affection
i
could
not
tell
you
all
i
have
seen
for
i
have
seen
crimes
against
which
justice
is
impotent
in
short
all
the
horrors
that
romancers
suppose
they
have
invented
are
still
below
the
truth
you
will
know
something
of
these
pretty
things
as
for
me
i
am
going
to
live
in
the
country
with
my
wife
i
have
a
horror
of
