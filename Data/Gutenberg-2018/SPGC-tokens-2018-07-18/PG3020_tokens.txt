volume

essay
i
on
the
pleasure
of
painting
is
a
pleasure
in
painting
which
none
but
painters
know
in
writing
you
have
to
contend
with
the
world
in
painting
you
have
only
to
carry
on
a
friendly
strife
with
nature
you
sit
down
to
your
task
and
are
happy
from
the
moment
that
you
take
up
the
pencil
and
look
nature
in
the
face
you
are
at
peace
with
your
own
heart
no
angry
passions
rise
to
disturb
the
silent
progress
of
the
work
to
shake
the
hand
or
dim
the
brow
no
irritable
humours
are
set
afloat
you
have
no
absurd
opinions
to
combat
no
point
to
strain
no
adversary
to
crush
no
fool
to
annoy
you
are
actuated
by
fear
or
favour
to
no
man
there
is
juggling
here
no
sophistry
no
intrigue
no
tampering
with
the
evidence
no
attempt
to
make
black
white
or
white
black
but
you
resign
yourself
into
the
hands
of
a
greater
power
that
of
nature
with
the
simplicity
of
a
child
and
the
devotion
of
an
enthusiast
with
joy
her
manner
and
with
rapture
taste
her
style
the
mind
is
calm
and
full
at
the
same
time
the
hand
and
eye
are
equally
employed
in
tracing
the
commonest
object
a
plant
or
the
stump
of
a
tree
you
learn
something
every
moment
you
perceive
unexpected
differences
and
discover
likenesses
where
you
looked
for
no
such
thing
you
try
to
set
down
what
you
see
find
out
your
error
and
correct
it
you
need
not
play
tricks
or
purposely
mistake
with
all
your
pains
you
are
still
far
short
of
the
mark
patience
grows
out
of
the
endless
pursuit
and
turns
it
into
a
luxury
a
streak
in
a
flower
a
wrinkle
in
a
leaf
a
tinge
in
a
cloud
a
stain
in
an
old
wall
or
ruin
grey
are
seized
with
avidity
as
the
of
this
sort
of
mental
warfare
and
furnish
out
labour
for
another
the
hours
pass
away
untold
without
chagrin
and
without
weariness
nor
would
you
ever
wish
to
pass
them
otherwise
innocence
is
joined
with
industry
pleasure
with
business
and
the
mind
is
satisfied
though
it
is
not
engaged
in
thinking
or
in
doing
any
mischief
i
have
not
much
pleasure
in
writing
these
or
in
reading
them
afterwards
though
i
own
i
now
and
then
meet
with
a
phrase
that
i
like
or
a
thought
that
strikes
me
as
a
true
one
but
after
i
begin
them
i
am
only
anxious
to
get
to
the
end
of
them
which
i
am
not
sure
i
shall
do
for
i
seldom
see
my
way
a
page
or
even
a
sentence
beforehand
and
when
i
have
as
by
a
miracle
escaped
i
trouble
myself
little
more
about
them
i
sometimes
have
to
write
them
twice
over
then
it
is
necessary
to
read
the
to
prevent
mistakes
by
the
printer
so
that
by
the
time
they
appear
in
a
tangible
shape
and
one
can
con
them
over
with
a
conscious
sidelong
glance
to
the
public
approbation
they
have
lost
their
gloss
and
relish
and
become
tedious
than
a
tale
for
a
person
to
read
his
own
works
over
with
any
great
delight
he
ought
first
to
forget
that
he
ever
wrote
them
familiarity
naturally
breeds
contempt
it
is
in
fact
like
poring
fondly
over
a
piece
of
blank
paper
from
repetition
the
words
convey
no
distinct
meaning
to
the
mind
are
mere
idle
sounds
except
that
our
vanity
claims
an
interest
and
property
in
them
i
have
more
satisfaction
in
my
own
thoughts
than
in
dictating
them
to
others
words
are
necessary
to
explain
the
impression
of
certain
things
upon
me
to
the
reader
but
they
rather
weaken
and
draw
a
veil
over
than
strengthen
it
to
myself
however
i
might
say
with
the
poet
mind
to
me
a
kingdom
is
yet
i
have
little
ambition
set
a
throne
or
chair
of
state
in
the
understandings
of
other
men
the
ideas
we
cherish
most
exist
best
in
a
kind
of
shadowy
abstraction
pure
in
the
last
recesses
of
the
mind
and
derive
neither
force
nor
interest
from
being
exposed
to
public
view
they
are
old
familiar
acquaintance
and
any
change
in
them
arising
from
the
adventitious
ornaments
of
style
or
dress
is
little
to
their
advantage
after
i
have
once
written
on
a
subject
it
goes
out
of
my
mind
my
feelings
about
it
have
been
melted
down
into
words
and
i
forget
i
have
as
it
were
discharged
my
memory
of
its
old
habitual
reckoning
and
rubbed
out
the
score
of
real
sentiment
for
the
future
it
exists
only
for
the
sake
of
others
but
i
can
not
say
from
my
own
experience
that
the
same
process
takes
place
in
transferring
our
ideas
to
canvas
they
gain
more
than
they
lose
in
the
mechanical
transformation
one
is
never
tired
of
painting
because
you
have
to
set
down
not
what
you
knew
already
but
what
you
have
just
discovered
in
the
former
case
you
translate
feelings
into
words
in
the
latter
names
into
things
there
is
a
continual
creation
out
of
nothing
going
on
with
every
stroke
of
the
brush
a
new
field
of
inquiry
is
laid
open
new
difficulties
arise
and
new
triumphs
are
prepared
over
them
by
comparing
the
imitation
with
the
original
you
see
what
you
have
done
and
how
much
you
have
still
to
do
the
test
of
the
senses
is
severer
than
that
of
fancy
and
an
even
for
the
delusions
of
our
one
part
of
a
picture
shames
another
and
you
determine
to
paint
up
to
yourself
if
you
can
not
come
up
to
nature
every
object
becomes
lustrous
from
the
light
thrown
back
upon
it
by
the
mirror
of
art
and
by
the
aid
of
the
pencil
we
may
be
said
to
touch
and
handle
the
objects
of
sight
the
visions
that
hover
on
the
verge
of
existence
have
a
bodily
presence
given
them
on
the
canvas
the
form
of
beauty
is
changed
into
a
substance
the
dream
and
the
glory
of
the
universe
is
made
to
feeling
as
well
as
sight
and
see
a
rainbow
starts
from
the
canvas
with
its
humid
train
of
glory
as
if
it
were
drawn
from
its
cloudy
arch
in
heaven
the
spangled
landscape
glitters
with
drops
of
dew
after
the
shower
the
fools
show
their
coats
in
the
gleams
of
the
setting
sun
the
shepherds
pipe
their
farewell
notes
in
the
fresh
evening
air
and
is
this
bright
vision
made
from
a
dead
dull
blank
like
a
bubble
reflecting
the
mighty
fabric
of
the
universe
who
would
think
this
miracle
of
rubens
pencil
possible
to
be
performed
who
having
seen
it
would
not
spend
his
life
to
do
the
like
see
how
the
rich
fallows
the
bare
the
scanty
drag
in
rembrandt
landscapes
how
often
have
i
looked
at
them
and
nature
and
tried
to
do
the
same
till
the
very
thickened
and
there
was
an
earthiness
in
the
feeling
of
the
air
there
is
no
end
of
the
refinements
of
art
and
nature
in
this
respect
one
may
look
at
the
misty
glimmering
horizon
till
the
eye
dazzles
and
the
imagination
is
lost
in
hopes
to
transfer
the
whole
interminable
expanse
at
one
blow
upon
the
canvas
wilson
said
he
used
to
try
to
paint
the
effect
of
the
motes
dancing
in
the
setting
sun
at
another
time
a
friend
coming
into
his
when
he
was
sitting
on
the
ground
in
a
melancholy
posture
observed
that
his
picture
looked
like
a
landscape
after
a
shower
he
started
up
with
the
greatest
delight
and
said
is
the
effect
i
intended
to
produce
but
thought
i
had
failed
wilson
was
neglected
and
by
degrees
neglected
his
art
to
apply
himself
to
brandy
his
hand
became
unsteady
so
that
it
was
only
by
repeated
attempts
that
he
could
reach
the
place
or
produce
the
effect
he
aimed
at
and
when
he
had
done
a
little
to
a
picture
he
would
say
to
any
acquaintance
who
chanced
to
drop
in
have
painted
enough
for
one
day
come
let
us
go
somewhere
it
was
not
so
claude
left
his
pictures
or
his
studies
on
the
banks
of
the
tiber
to
go
in
search
of
other
enjoyments
or
ceased
to
gaze
upon
the
glittering
sunny
vales
and
distant
hills
and
while
his
eye
drank
in
the
clear
sparkling
hues
and
lovely
forms
of
nature
his
hand
stamped
them
on
the
lucid
canvas
to
last
there
for
ever
one
of
the
most
delightful
parts
of
my
life
was
one
fine
summer
when
i
used
to
walk
out
of
an
evening
to
catch
the
last
light
of
the
sun
gemming
the
green
slopes
or
russet
lawns
and
gilding
tower
or
tree
while
the
blue
sky
gradually
turning
to
purple
and
gold
or
skirted
with
dusky
grey
hung
its
broad
marble
pavement
over
all
as
we
see
it
in
the
great
master
of
italian
landscape
but
to
come
to
a
more
particular
explanation
of
the
subject
the
first
head
i
ever
tried
to
paint
was
an
old
woman
with
the
upper
part
of
the
face
shaded
by
her
bonnet
and
i
certainly
laboured
at
it
with
great
perseverance
it
took
me
numberless
sittings
to
do
it
i
have
it
by
me
still
and
sometimes
look
at
it
with
surprise
to
think
how
much
pains
were
thrown
away
to
little
purpose
yet
not
altogether
in
vain
if
it
taught
me
to
see
good
in
everything
and
to
know
that
there
is
nothing
vulgar
in
nature
seen
with
the
eye
of
science
or
of
true
art
refinement
creates
beauty
everywhere
it
is
the
grossness
of
the
spectator
that
discovers
nothing
but
grossness
in
the
object
be
this
as
it
may
i
spared
no
pains
to
do
my
best
if
art
was
long
i
thought
that
life
was
so
too
at
that
moment
i
got
in
the
general
effect
the
first
day
and
pleased
and
surprised
enough
i
was
at
my
success
the
rest
was
a
work
of
time
of
weeks
and
months
if
need
were
of
patient
toil
and
careful
finishing
i
had
seen
an
old
head
by
rembrandt
at
burleigh
house
and
if
i
could
produce
a
head
at
all
like
rembrandt
in
a
year
in
my
lifetime
it
would
be
glory
and
felicity
and
wealth
and
fame
enough
for
me
the
head
i
had
seen
at
burleigh
was
an
exact
and
wonderful
facsimile
of
nature
and
i
resolved
to
make
mine
as
nearly
as
i
could
an
exact
facsimile
of
nature
i
did
not
then
nor
do
i
now
believe
with
sir
joshua
that
the
perfection
of
art
consists
in
giving
general
appearances
without
individual
details
but
in
giving
general
appearances
with
individual
details
otherwise
i
had
done
my
work
the
first
day
but
i
saw
something
more
in
nature
than
general
effect
and
i
thought
it
worth
my
while
to
give
it
in
the
picture
there
was
a
gorgeous
effect
of
light
and
shade
but
there
was
a
delicacy
as
well
as
depth
in
the
chiaroscuro
which
i
was
bound
to
follow
into
its
dim
and
scarce
perceptible
variety
of
tone
and
shadow
then
i
had
to
make
the
transition
from
a
strong
light
to
as
dark
a
shade
preserving
the
masses
but
gradually
softening
off
the
intermediate
parts
it
was
so
in
nature
the
difficulty
was
to
make
it
so
in
the
copy
i
tried
and
failed
again
and
again
i
strove
harder
and
succeeded
as
i
thought
the
wrinkles
in
rembrandt
were
not
hard
lines
but
broken
and
irregular
i
saw
the
same
appearance
in
nature
and
strained
every
nerve
to
give
it
if
i
could
hit
off
this
edgy
appearance
and
insert
the
reflected
light
in
the
furrows
of
old
age
in
half
a
morning
i
did
not
think
i
had
lost
a
day
beneath
the
shrivelled
yellow
parchment
look
of
the
skin
there
was
here
and
there
a
streak
of
the
tinging
the
face
this
i
made
a
point
of
conveying
and
did
not
cease
to
compare
what
i
saw
with
what
i
did
with
jealous
watchfulness
till
i
succeeded
to
the
best
of
my
ability
and
judgment
how
many
revisions
were
there
how
many
attempts
to
catch
an
expression
which
i
had
seen
the
day
before
how
often
did
we
try
to
get
the
old
position
and
wait
for
the
return
of
the
same
light
there
was
a
puckering
up
of
the
lips
a
cautious
introversion
of
the
eye
under
the
shadow
of
the
bonnet
indicative
of
the
feebleness
and
suspicion
of
old
age
which
at
last
we
managed
after
many
trials
and
some
quarrels
to
a
tolerable
nicety
the
picture
was
never
finished
and
i
might
have
gone
on
with
it
to
the
present
hour
i
used
to
sit
it
on
the
ground
when
my
day
work
was
done
and
saw
revealed
to
me
with
swimming
eyes
the
birth
of
new
hopes
and
of
a
new
world
of
objects
the
painter
thus
learns
to
look
at
nature
with
different
eyes
he
before
saw
her
in
a
glass
darkly
but
now
face
to
face
he
understands
the
texture
and
meaning
of
the
visible
universe
and
into
the
life
of
things
not
by
the
help
of
mechanical
instruments
but
of
the
improved
exercise
of
his
faculties
and
an
intimate
sympathy
with
nature
the
meanest
thing
is
not
lost
upon
him
for
he
looks
at
it
with
an
eye
to
itself
not
merely
to
his
own
vanity
or
interest
or
the
opinion
of
the
world
even
where
there
is
neither
beauty
nor
use
if
that
ever
were
still
there
is
truth
and
a
sufficient
source
of
gratification
in
the
indulgence
of
curiosity
and
activity
of
mind
the
humblest
printer
is
a
true
scholar
and
the
best
of
scholars
the
scholar
of
nature
for
myself
and
for
the
real
comfort
and
satisfaction
of
the
thing
i
had
rather
have
been
jan
steen
or
gerard
dow
than
the
greatest
casuist
or
philologer
that
ever
lived
the
painter
does
not
view
things
in
clouds
or
the
common
gloss
of
theologians
but
applies
the
same
standard
of
truth
and
disinterested
spirit
of
inquiry
that
influence
his
daily
practice
to
other
subjects
he
perceives
form
he
distinguishes
character
he
reads
men
and
books
with
an
intuitive
eye
he
is
a
critic
as
well
as
a
connoisseur
the
conclusions
he
draws
are
clear
and
convincing
because
they
are
taken
from
the
things
themselves
he
is
not
a
fanatic
a
dupe
or
a
slave
for
the
habit
of
seeing
for
himself
also
disposes
him
to
judge
for
himself
the
most
sensible
men
i
know
taken
as
a
class
are
painters
that
is
they
are
the
most
lively
observers
of
what
passes
in
the
world
about
them
and
the
closest
observers
of
what
passes
in
their
own
minds
from
their
profession
they
in
general
mix
more
with
the
world
than
authors
and
if
they
have
not
the
same
fund
of
acquired
knowledge
are
obliged
to
rely
more
on
individual
sagacity
i
might
mention
the
names
of
opie
fuseli
northcote
as
persons
distinguished
for
striking
description
and
acquaintance
with
the
subtle
traits
of
character
painters
in
ordinary
society
or
in
obscure
situations
where
their
value
is
not
known
and
they
are
treated
with
neglect
and
indifference
have
sometimes
a
forward
of
manner
but
this
is
not
so
much
their
fault
as
that
of
others
perhaps
their
want
of
regular
education
may
also
be
in
fault
in
such
cases
richardson
who
is
very
tenacious
of
the
respect
in
which
the
profession
ought
to
be
held
tells
a
story
of
michael
angelo
that
after
a
quarrel
between
him
and
pope
julius
account
of
a
slight
the
artist
conceived
the
pontiff
had
put
upon
him
michael
angelo
was
introduced
by
a
bishop
who
thinking
to
serve
the
artist
by
it
made
it
an
argument
that
the
pope
should
be
reconciled
to
him
because
men
of
his
profession
were
commonly
ignorant
and
of
no
consequence
otherwise
his
holiness
enraged
at
the
bishop
struck
him
with
his
staff
and
told
him
it
was
he
that
was
the
blockhead
and
affronted
the
man
himself
would
not
offend
the
prelate
was
driven
out
of
the
chamber
and
michael
angelo
had
the
pope
benediction
accompanied
with
presents
this
bishop
had
fallen
into
the
vulgar
error
and
was
rebuked
accordingly
besides
the
exercise
of
the
mind
painting
exercises
the
body
it
is
a
mechanical
as
well
as
a
liberal
art
to
do
anything
to
dig
a
hole
in
the
ground
to
plant
a
cabbage
to
hit
a
mark
to
move
a
shuttle
to
work
a
pattern
in
a
word
to
attempt
to
produce
any
effect
and
to
has
something
in
it
that
gratifies
the
love
of
power
and
carries
off
the
restless
activity
of
the
mind
of
man
indolence
is
a
delightful
but
distressing
state
we
must
be
doing
something
to
be
happy
action
is
no
less
necessary
than
thought
to
the
instinctive
tendencies
of
the
human
frame
and
painting
combines
them
both
incessantly
the
hand
is
furnished
a
practical
test
of
the
correctness
of
the
eye
and
the
eye
thus
admonished
imposes
fresh
tasks
of
skill
and
industry
upon
the
hand
every
stroke
tells
as
the
verifying
of
a
new
truth
and
every
new
observation
the
instant
it
is
made
passes
into
an
act
and
emanation
of
the
will
every
step
is
nearer
what
we
wish
and
yet
there
is
always
more
to
do
in
spite
of
the
facility
the
fluttering
grace
the
evanescent
hues
that
play
round
the
pencil
of
rubens
and
however
i
may
admire
i
do
not
envy
them
this
power
so
much
as
i
do
the
slow
patient
laborious
execution
of
correggio
leonardo
da
vinci
and
andrea
del
sarto
where
every
touch
appears
conscious
of
its
charge
emulous
of
truth
and
where
the
painful
artist
has
so
distinctly
wrought
that
you
might
almost
say
his
picture
thought
in
the
one
case
the
colours
seem
breathed
on
the
canvas
as
if
by
magic
the
work
and
the
wonder
of
a
moment
in
the
other
they
seem
inlaid
in
the
body
of
the
work
and
as
if
it
took
the
artist
years
of
unremitting
labour
and
of
delightful
progress
to
perfection
who
would
wish
ever
to
come
to
the
close
of
such
works
not
to
dwell
on
them
to
return
to
them
to
be
wedded
to
them
to
the
last
rubens
with
his
florid
rapid
style
complains
that
when
he
had
just
learned
his
art
he
should
be
forced
to
die
leonardo
in
the
slow
advances
of
his
had
lived
long
enough
painting
is
not
like
writing
what
is
properly
understood
by
a
sedentary
employment
it
requires
not
indeed
a
strong
but
a
continued
and
steady
exertion
of
muscular
power
the
precision
and
delicacy
of
the
manual
operation
makes
up
for
the
want
of
vehemence
as
to
balance
himself
for
any
time
in
the
same
position
the
must
strain
every
nerve
painting
for
a
whole
morning
gives
one
as
excellent
an
appetite
for
one
dinner
as
old
abraham
tucker
acquired
for
his
by
riding
over
banstead
downs
it
is
related
of
sir
joshua
reynolds
that
took
no
other
exercise
than
what
he
used
in
his
the
writer
means
in
walking
backwards
and
forwards
to
look
at
his
picture
but
the
act
of
painting
itself
of
laying
on
the
colours
in
the
proper
place
and
proper
quantity
was
a
much
harder
exercise
than
this
alternate
receding
from
and
returning
to
the
picture
this
last
would
be
rather
a
relaxation
and
relief
than
an
effort
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
an
artist
like
sir
joshua
who
delighted
so
much
in
the
sensual
and
practical
part
of
his
art
should
have
found
himself
at
a
considerable
loss
when
the
decay
of
his
sight
precluded
him
for
the
last
year
or
two
of
his
life
from
the
following
up
of
his
profession
source
according
to
his
own
remark
thirty
years
uninterrupted
enjoyment
and
prosperity
to
him
it
is
only
those
who
never
think
at
all
or
else
who
have
accustomed
themselves
to
brood
incessantly
on
abstract
ideas
that
never
feel
ennui
to
give
one
instance
more
and
then
i
will
have
done
with
this
rambling
discourse
one
of
my
first
attempts
was
a
picture
of
my
father
who
was
then
in
a
green
old
age
with
features
and
scarred
with
the
smallpox
i
drew
it
out
with
a
broad
light
crossing
the
face
looking
down
with
spectacles
on
reading
the
book
was
in
a
fine
old
binding
with
gribelin
etchings
my
father
would
as
lieve
it
had
been
any
other
book
but
for
him
to
read
was
to
be
content
was
fineless
the
sketch
promised
well
and
i
set
to
work
to
finish
it
determined
to
spare
no
time
nor
pains
my
father
was
willing
to
sit
as
long
as
i
pleased
for
there
is
a
natural
desire
in
the
mind
of
man
to
sit
for
one
picture
to
be
the
object
of
continued
attention
to
have
one
likeness
multiplied
and
besides
his
satisfaction
in
the
picture
he
had
some
pride
in
the
artist
though
he
would
rather
i
should
have
written
a
sermon
than
painted
like
rembrandt
or
like
raphael
those
winter
days
with
the
gleams
of
sunshine
coming
through
the
and
cheered
by
the
notes
of
the
in
our
garden
that
in
the
haunch
of
winter
sings
as
my
afternoon
work
drew
to
a
close
were
among
the
happiest
of
my
life
when
i
gave
the
effect
i
intended
to
any
part
of
the
picture
for
which
i
had
prepared
my
colours
when
i
imitated
the
roughness
of
the
skin
by
a
lucky
stroke
of
the
pencil
when
i
hit
the
clear
pearly
tone
of
a
vein
when
i
gave
the
ruddy
complexion
of
health
the
blood
circulating
under
the
broad
shadows
of
one
side
of
the
face
i
thought
my
fortune
made
or
rather
it
was
already
more
than
made
i
might
one
day
be
able
to
say
with
correggio
also
am
a
painter
it
was
an
idle
thought
a
boy
conceit
but
it
did
not
make
me
less
happy
at
the
time
i
used
regularly
to
set
my
work
in
the
chair
to
look
at
it
through
the
long
evenings
and
many
a
time
did
i
return
to
take
leave
of
it
before
i
could
go
to
bed
at
night
i
remember
sending
it
with
a
throbbing
heart
to
the
exhibition
and
seeing
it
hung
up
there
by
the
side
of
one
of
the
honourable
skeffington
now
sir
george
there
was
nothing
in
common
between
them
but
that
they
were
the
portraits
of
two
very
men
i
think
but
am
not
sure
that
i
finished
this
portrait
or
another
afterwards
on
the
same
day
that
the
news
of
the
battle
of
austerlitz
came
i
walked
out
in
the
afternoon
and
as
i
returned
saw
the
evening
star
set
over
a
poor
man
cottage
with
other
thoughts
and
feelings
than
i
shall
ever
have
again
oh
for
the
revolution
of
the
great
platonic
year
that
those
times
might
come
over
again
i
could
sleep
out
the
three
hundred
and
thousand
intervening
years
very
contentedly
the
picture
is
left
the
table
the
chair
the
window
where
i
learned
to
construe
livy
the
chapel
where
my
father
preached
remain
where
they
were
but
he
himself
is
gone
to
rest
full
of
years
of
faith
of
hope
and
charity
notes
to
essay
i
there
is
a
passage
in
werter
which
contains
a
very
pleasing
illustration
of
this
doctrine
and
is
as
follows
a
league
from
the
town
is
a
place
called
walheim
it
is
very
agreeably
situated
on
the
side
of
a
hill
from
one
of
the
paths
which
leads
out
of
the
village
you
have
a
view
of
the
whole
country
and
there
to
a
good
old
woman
who
sells
wine
coffee
and
tea
there
but
better
than
all
this
are
two
before
the
church
which
spread
their
branches
over
a
little
green
surrounded
by
barns
and
cottages
i
have
seen
few
places
more
retired
and
peaceful
i
send
for
a
chair
and
table
from
the
old
woman
and
there
i
drink
my
coffee
and
read
homer
it
was
by
accident
that
i
discovered
this
place
one
fine
afternoon
all
was
perfect
stillness
everybody
was
in
the
fields
except
a
little
boy
about
four
years
old
who
was
sitting
on
the
ground
and
holding
between
his
knees
a
child
of
about
six
months
he
pressed
it
to
his
bosom
with
his
little
arms
which
made
a
sort
of
great
chair
for
it
and
notwithstanding
the
vivacity
which
sparkled
in
his
eyes
he
sat
perfectly
still
quite
delighted
with
the
scene
i
sat
down
on
a
plough
opposite
and
had
great
pleasure
in
drawing
this
little
picture
of
brotherly
tenderness
i
added
a
bit
of
the
hedge
the
and
some
broken
without
any
order
just
as
they
happened
to
lie
and
in
about
an
hour
i
found
i
had
made
a
drawing
of
great
expression
and
very
correct
design
without
having
put
in
anything
of
my
own
this
confirmed
me
in
the
resolution
i
had
made
before
only
to
copy
nature
for
the
future
nature
is
inexhaustible
and
alone
forms
the
greatest
masters
say
what
you
will
of
rules
they
alter
the
true
features
and
the
natural
expression
it
is
at
present
covered
with
a
thick
slough
of
oil
and
varnish
the
perishable
vehicle
of
the
english
school
like
an
envelope
of
goldbeaters
skin
so
as
to
be
hardly
visible
men
in
business
who
are
answerable
with
their
fortunes
for
the
consequences
of
their
opinions
and
are
therefore
accustomed
to
ascertain
pretty
accurately
the
grounds
on
which
they
act
before
they
commit
themselves
on
the
event
are
often
men
of
remarkably
quick
and
sound
judgements
artists
in
like
manner
must
know
tolerably
well
what
they
are
about
before
they
can
bring
the
result
of
their
observations
to
the
test
of
ocular
demonstration
the
famous
schiller
used
to
say
that
he
found
the
great
happiness
of
life
after
all
to
consist
in
the
discharge
of
some
mechanical
duty
the
rich
of
titian
and
giorgione
combines
something
of
the
advantages
of
both
these
styles
the
felicity
of
the
one
with
the
carefulness
of
the
other
and
is
perhaps
to
be
preferred
to
either
essay
ii
the
same
subject
continued
the
painter
not
only
takes
a
delight
in
nature
he
has
a
new
and
exquisite
source
of
pleasure
opened
to
him
in
the
study
and
contemplation
of
works
of
art
lorraine
light
touch
with
hue
or
savage
rosa
dash
or
learned
poussin
drew
he
turns
aside
to
view
a
country
gentleman
seat
with
eager
looks
thinking
it
may
contain
some
of
the
rich
products
of
art
there
is
an
air
round
lord
radnor
park
for
there
hang
the
two
claudes
the
morning
and
evening
of
the
roman
empire
round
wilton
house
for
there
is
vandyke
picture
of
the
pembroke
family
round
blenheim
for
there
is
his
picture
of
the
duke
of
buckingham
children
and
the
most
magnificent
collection
of
rubenses
in
the
world
at
knowsley
for
there
is
rembrandt
handwriting
on
the
wall
and
at
burleigh
for
there
are
some
of
guido
angelic
heads
the
young
artist
makes
a
pilgrimage
to
each
of
these
places
eyes
them
wistfully
at
a
distance
high
in
tufted
trees
and
feels
an
interest
in
them
of
which
the
owner
is
scarce
conscious
he
enters
the
walks
and
echoing
archways
passes
the
threshold
is
led
through
wainscoted
rooms
is
shown
the
furniture
the
rich
hangings
the
tapestry
the
massy
services
of
plate
and
at
last
is
ushered
into
the
room
where
his
treasure
is
the
idol
of
his
vows
some
speaking
face
or
bright
landscape
it
is
stamped
on
his
brain
and
lives
there
thenceforward
a
tally
for
nature
and
a
test
of
art
he
furnishes
out
the
chambers
of
the
mind
from
the
spoils
of
time
picks
and
chooses
which
shall
have
the
best
places
nearest
his
heart
he
goes
away
richer
than
he
came
richer
than
the
possessor
and
thinks
that
he
may
one
day
return
when
he
perhaps
shall
have
done
something
like
them
or
even
from
failure
shall
have
learned
to
admire
truth
and
genius
more
my
first
initiation
in
the
mysteries
of
the
art
was
at
the
orleans
gallery
it
was
there
i
formed
my
taste
such
as
it
is
so
that
i
am
irreclaimably
of
the
old
school
in
painting
i
was
staggered
when
i
saw
the
works
there
collected
and
looked
at
them
with
wondering
and
with
longing
eyes
a
mist
passed
away
from
my
sight
the
scales
fell
off
a
new
sense
came
upon
me
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
stood
before
me
i
saw
the
soul
speaking
in
the
face
that
the
rod
of
empire
had
swayed
in
mighty
ages
past
forked
mountain
or
blue
promontory
with
trees
that
nod
unto
the
world
and
mock
our
eyes
with
air
old
time
had
unlocked
his
treasures
and
fame
stood
portress
at
the
door
we
had
all
heard
of
the
names
of
titian
raphael
guido
domenichino
the
caracci
but
to
see
them
face
to
face
to
be
in
the
same
room
with
their
deathless
productions
was
like
breaking
some
mighty
spell
was
almost
an
effect
of
necromancy
from
that
time
i
lived
in
a
world
of
pictures
battles
sieges
speeches
in
parliament
seemed
mere
idle
noise
and
fury
nothing
compared
with
those
mighty
works
and
dreaded
names
that
spoke
to
me
in
the
eternal
silence
of
thought
this
was
the
more
remarkable
as
it
was
but
a
short
time
before
that
i
was
not
only
totally
ignorant
of
but
insensible
to
the
beauties
of
art
as
an
instance
i
remember
that
one
afternoon
i
was
reading
provoked
with
the
highest
relish
with
a
green
woody
landscape
of
ruysdael
or
hobbima
just
before
me
at
which
i
looked
off
the
book
now
and
then
and
wondered
what
there
could
be
in
that
sort
of
work
to
satisfy
or
delight
the
mind
at
the
same
time
asking
myself
as
a
speculative
question
whether
i
should
ever
feel
an
interest
in
it
like
what
i
took
in
reading
vanbrugh
and
cibber
i
had
made
some
progress
in
painting
when
i
went
to
the
louvre
to
study
and
i
never
did
anything
afterwards
i
never
shall
forget
conning
over
the
catalogue
which
a
friend
lent
me
just
before
i
set
out
the
pictures
the
names
of
the
painters
seemed
to
relish
in
the
mouth
there
was
one
of
titian
mistress
at
her
toilette
even
the
colours
with
which
the
painter
had
adorned
her
hair
were
not
more
golden
more
amiable
to
sight
than
those
which
played
round
and
tantalised
my
fancy
ere
i
saw
the
picture
there
were
two
portraits
by
the
same
hand
young
nobleman
with
a
glove
another
companion
to
it
i
read
the
description
over
and
over
with
fond
expectancy
and
filled
up
the
imaginary
outline
with
whatever
i
could
conceive
of
grace
and
dignity
and
an
antique
gusto
all
but
equal
to
the
original
there
was
the
transfiguration
too
with
what
awe
i
saw
it
in
my
mind
eye
and
was
overshadowed
with
the
spirit
of
the
artist
not
to
have
been
disappointed
with
these
works
afterwards
was
the
highest
compliment
i
can
pay
to
their
transcendent
merits
indeed
it
was
from
seeing
other
works
of
the
same
great
masters
that
i
had
formed
a
vague
but
no
disparaging
idea
of
these
the
first
day
i
got
there
i
was
kept
for
some
time
in
the
french
exhibition
room
and
thought
i
should
not
be
able
to
get
a
sight
of
the
old
masters
i
just
caught
a
peep
at
them
through
the
door
vile
hindrance
like
looking
out
of
purgatory
into
paradise
from
poussin
noble
landscapes
to
where
rubens
hung
out
his
gaudy
banner
and
down
the
glimmering
vista
to
the
rich
jewels
of
titian
and
the
italian
school
at
last
by
much
importunity
i
was
admitted
and
lost
not
an
instant
in
making
use
of
my
new
privilege
it
was
beau
to
me
i
marched
delighted
through
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
the
proudest
efforts
of
the
mind
of
man
a
whole
creation
of
genius
a
universe
of
art
i
ran
the
gauntlet
of
all
the
schools
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
and
in
the
end
got
admitted
into
the
inner
room
where
they
had
been
repairing
some
of
their
greatest
works
here
the
transfiguration
the
peter
martyr
and
the
jerome
of
domenichino
stood
on
the
floor
as
if
they
had
bent
their
knees
like
camels
stooping
to
unlade
their
riches
to
the
spectator
on
one
side
on
an
easel
stood
hippolito
de
medici
a
portrait
by
titian
with
a
in
his
hand
looking
through
those
he
saw
till
you
turned
away
from
the
keen
glance
and
thrown
together
in
heaps
were
landscapes
of
the
same
hand
green
pastoral
hills
and
vales
and
shepherds
piping
to
their
mild
mistresses
underneath
the
flowering
shade
reader
thou
hast
not
seen
the
louvre
thou
art
damned
for
thou
hast
not
seen
the
choicest
remains
of
the
works
of
art
or
thou
hast
not
seen
all
these
together
with
their
mutually
reflected
glories
i
say
nothing
of
the
statues
for
i
know
but
little
of
sculpture
and
never
liked
any
till
i
saw
the
elgin
marbles
here
for
four
months
together
i
strolled
and
studied
and
daily
heard
the
warning
sound
heures
passees
il
faut
fermer
citoyens
ah
why
did
they
ever
change
their
style
muttered
in
coarse
provincial
french
and
brought
away
with
me
some
loose
draughts
and
fragments
which
i
have
been
forced
to
part
with
like
drops
of
for
money
how
often
thou
tenantless
mansion
of
godlike
magnificence
how
often
has
my
heart
since
gone
a
pilgrimage
to
thee
it
has
been
made
a
question
whether
the
artist
or
the
mere
man
of
taste
and
natural
sensibility
receives
most
pleasure
from
the
contemplation
of
works
of
art
and
i
think
this
question
might
be
answered
by
another
as
a
sort
of
namely
whether
any
one
out
of
that
numberless
of
mere
gentlemen
and
amateurs
who
visited
paris
at
the
period
here
spoken
of
felt
as
much
interest
as
much
pride
or
pleasure
in
this
display
of
the
most
striking
monuments
of
art
as
the
humblest
student
would
the
first
entrance
into
the
louvre
would
be
only
one
of
the
events
of
his
journey
not
an
event
in
his
life
remembered
ever
after
with
thankfulness
and
regret
he
would
explore
it
with
the
same
unmeaning
curiosity
and
idle
wonder
as
he
would
the
regalia
in
the
tower
or
the
botanic
garden
in
the
tuileries
but
not
with
the
fond
enthusiasm
of
an
artist
how
should
he
his
is
fruition
joyless
unendeared
but
the
painter
is
wedded
to
his
art
the
mistress
queen
and
idol
of
his
soul
he
has
embarked
his
all
in
it
fame
time
fortune
peace
of
mind
his
hopes
in
youth
his
consolation
in
age
and
shall
he
not
feel
a
more
intense
interest
in
whatever
relates
to
it
than
the
mere
indolent
trifler
natural
sensibility
alone
without
the
entire
application
of
the
mind
to
that
one
object
will
not
enable
the
possessor
to
sympathise
with
all
the
degrees
of
beauty
and
power
in
the
conceptions
of
a
titian
or
a
correggio
but
it
is
he
only
who
does
this
who
follows
them
into
all
their
force
and
matchless
race
that
does
or
can
feel
their
full
value
knowledge
is
pleasure
as
well
as
power
no
one
but
the
artist
who
has
studied
nature
and
contended
with
the
difficulties
of
art
can
be
aware
of
the
beauties
or
intoxicated
with
a
passion
for
painting
no
one
who
has
not
devoted
his
life
and
soul
to
the
pursuit
of
art
can
feel
the
same
exultation
in
its
brightest
ornaments
and
loftiest
triumphs
which
an
artist
does
where
the
treasure
is
there
the
heart
is
also
it
is
now
seventeen
years
since
i
was
studying
in
the
louvre
and
i
have
on
since
given
up
all
thoughts
of
the
art
as
a
profession
but
long
after
i
returned
and
even
still
i
sometimes
dream
of
being
there
again
of
asking
for
the
old
pictures
and
not
finding
them
or
finding
them
changed
or
faded
from
what
they
were
i
cry
myself
awake
what
ever
does
this
at
such
a
distance
of
time
that
is
ever
received
pleasure
or
took
interest
enough
in
them
to
produce
so
lasting
an
impression
but
it
is
said
that
if
a
person
had
the
same
natural
taste
and
the
same
acquired
knowledge
as
an
artist
without
the
petty
interests
and
technical
notions
he
would
derive
a
purer
pleasure
from
seeing
a
fine
portrait
a
fine
landscape
and
so
on
this
however
is
not
so
much
begging
the
question
as
asking
an
impossibility
he
can
not
have
the
same
insight
into
the
end
without
having
studied
the
means
nor
the
same
love
of
art
without
the
same
habitual
and
exclusive
attachment
to
it
painters
are
no
doubt
often
actuated
by
jealousy
to
that
only
which
they
find
useful
to
themselves
in
painting
wilson
has
been
seen
poring
over
the
texture
of
a
dutch
so
that
he
could
not
see
the
picture
itself
but
this
is
the
perversion
and
pedantry
of
the
profession
not
its
true
or
genuine
spirit
if
wilson
had
never
looked
at
anything
but
megilps
and
handling
he
never
would
have
put
the
soul
of
life
and
manners
into
his
pictures
as
he
has
done
another
objection
is
that
the
instrumental
parts
of
the
art
the
means
the
first
rudiments
paints
oils
and
brushes
are
painful
and
disgusting
and
that
the
consciousness
of
the
difficulty
and
anxiety
with
which
perfection
has
been
attained
must
take
away
from
the
pleasure
of
the
finest
performance
this
however
is
only
an
additional
proof
of
the
greater
pleasure
derived
by
the
artist
from
his
profession
for
these
things
which
are
said
to
interfere
with
and
destroy
the
common
interest
in
works
of
art
do
not
disturb
him
he
never
once
thinks
of
them
he
is
absorbed
in
the
pursuit
of
a
higher
object
he
is
intent
not
on
the
means
but
the
end
he
is
taken
up
not
with
the
difficulties
but
with
the
triumph
over
them
as
in
the
case
of
the
anatomist
who
overlooks
many
things
in
the
eagerness
of
his
search
after
abstract
truth
or
the
alchemist
who
while
he
is
raking
into
his
soot
and
furnaces
lives
in
a
golden
dream
a
lesser
gives
way
to
a
greater
object
but
it
is
pretended
that
the
painter
may
be
supposed
to
submit
to
the
unpleasant
part
of
the
process
only
for
the
sake
of
the
fame
or
profit
in
view
so
far
is
this
from
being
a
true
state
of
the
case
that
i
will
venture
to
say
in
the
instance
of
a
friend
of
mine
who
has
lately
succeeded
in
an
important
undertaking
in
his
art
that
not
all
the
fame
he
has
acquired
not
all
the
money
he
has
received
from
thousands
of
admiring
spectators
not
all
the
newspaper
puffs
nor
even
the
praise
of
the
not
all
these
put
together
ever
gave
him
at
any
time
the
same
genuine
undoubted
satisfaction
as
any
one
employed
in
the
ardent
and
propitious
pursuit
of
his
art
in
finishing
to
his
content
a
foot
a
hand
or
even
a
piece
of
drapery
what
is
the
state
of
mind
of
an
artist
while
he
is
at
work
he
is
then
in
the
act
of
realising
the
highest
idea
he
can
form
of
beauty
or
grandeur
he
conceives
he
embodies
that
which
he
understands
and
loves
best
that
is
he
is
in
full
and
perfect
possession
of
that
which
is
to
him
the
source
of
the
highest
happiness
and
intellectual
excitement
which
he
can
enjoy
in
short
as
a
conclusion
to
this
argument
i
will
mention
a
circumstance
which
fell
under
my
knowledge
the
other
day
a
friend
had
bought
a
print
of
titian
mistress
the
same
to
which
i
have
alluded
above
he
was
anxious
to
show
it
me
on
this
account
i
told
him
it
was
a
spirited
engraving
but
it
had
not
the
look
of
the
original
i
believe
he
thought
this
fastidious
till
i
offered
to
show
him
a
rough
sketch
of
it
which
i
had
by
me
having
seen
this
he
said
he
perceived
exactly
what
i
meant
and
could
not
bear
to
look
at
the
print
afterwards
he
had
good
sense
enough
to
see
the
difference
in
the
individual
instance
but
a
person
better
acquainted
with
titian
manner
and
with
art
in
general
that
is
of
a
more
cultivated
and
refined
taste
would
know
that
it
was
a
bad
print
without
having
any
immediate
model
to
compare
it
with
he
would
perceive
with
a
glance
of
the
eye
with
a
sort
of
instinctive
feeling
that
it
was
hard
and
without
that
bland
expansive
and
nameless
expression
which
always
distinguished
most
famous
works
any
one
who
is
accustomed
to
a
head
in
a
picture
can
never
reconcile
himself
to
a
print
from
it
but
to
the
ignorant
they
are
both
the
same
to
a
vulgar
eye
there
is
no
difference
between
a
guido
and
a
daub
between
a
penny
print
or
the
vilest
scrawl
and
the
most
finished
performance
in
other
words
all
that
excellence
which
lies
between
these
two
extremes
all
at
least
that
marks
the
excess
above
mediocrity
all
that
constitutes
true
beauty
harmony
refinement
grandeur
is
lost
upon
the
common
observer
but
it
is
from
this
point
that
the
delight
the
glowing
raptures
of
the
true
adept
commence
an
uninformed
spectator
may
like
an
ordinary
drawing
better
than
the
ablest
connoisseur
but
for
that
very
reason
he
can
not
like
the
highest
specimens
of
art
so
well
the
refinements
not
only
of
execution
but
of
truth
and
nature
are
inaccessible
to
unpractised
eyes
the
exquisite
gradations
in
a
sky
of
claude
are
not
perceived
by
such
persons
and
consequently
the
harmony
can
not
be
felt
where
there
is
no
conscious
apprehension
there
can
be
no
conscious
pleasure
wonder
at
the
first
sights
of
works
of
art
may
be
the
effect
of
ignorance
and
novelty
but
real
admiration
and
permanent
delight
in
them
are
the
growth
of
taste
and
knowledge
would
not
wish
to
have
your
eyes
said
a
man
to
a
critic
who
was
finding
fault
with
a
picture
in
which
the
other
saw
no
blemish
why
so
the
idea
which
prevented
him
from
admiring
this
inferior
production
was
a
higher
idea
of
truth
and
beauty
which
was
ever
present
with
him
and
a
continual
source
of
pleasing
and
lofty
contemplations
it
may
be
different
in
a
taste
for
outward
luxuries
and
the
privations
of
mere
sense
but
the
idea
of
perfection
which
acts
as
an
intellectual
foil
is
always
an
addition
a
support
and
a
proud
consolation
richardson
in
his
which
ought
to
be
better
known
has
left
some
striking
examples
of
the
felicity
and
infelicity
of
artists
both
as
it
relates
to
their
external
fortune
and
to
the
practice
of
their
art
in
speaking
of
knowledge
of
he
exclaims
one
is
considering
a
picture
or
a
drawing
one
at
the
same
time
thinks
this
was
done
by
him
who
had
many
extraordinary
endowments
of
body
and
mind
but
was
withal
very
capricious
who
was
honoured
in
life
and
death
expiring
in
the
arms
of
one
of
the
greatest
princes
of
that
age
francis
king
of
france
who
loved
him
as
a
friend
another
is
of
him
who
lived
a
long
and
happy
life
beloved
of
charles
emperor
and
many
others
of
the
first
princes
of
europe
when
one
has
another
in
hand
we
think
this
was
done
by
one
who
so
excelled
in
three
arts
as
that
any
of
them
in
that
degree
had
rendered
him
worthy
of
immortality
and
one
moreover
that
durst
contend
with
his
sovereign
one
of
the
haughtiest
popes
that
ever
was
upon
a
slight
offered
to
him
and
extricated
himself
with
honour
another
is
the
work
of
him
who
without
any
one
exterior
advantage
but
mere
strength
of
genius
had
the
most
sublime
imaginations
and
executed
them
accordingly
yet
lived
and
died
obscurely
another
we
shall
consider
as
the
work
of
him
who
restored
painting
when
it
had
almost
sunk
of
him
whom
art
made
honourable
but
who
neglecting
and
despising
greatness
with
a
sort
of
cynical
pride
was
treated
suitably
to
the
figure
he
gave
himself
not
his
intrinsic
worth
which
he
not
having
philosophy
enough
to
bear
it
broke
his
heart
another
is
done
by
one
who
on
the
contrary
was
a
fine
gentleman
and
lived
in
great
magnificence
and
was
much
honoured
by
his
own
and
foreign
princes
who
was
a
courtier
a
statesman
and
a
painter
and
so
much
all
these
that
when
he
acted
in
either
character
seemed
to
be
his
business
and
the
others
his
diversion
i
say
when
one
thus
reflects
besides
the
pleasure
arising
from
the
beauties
and
excellences
of
the
work
the
fine
ideas
it
gives
us
of
natural
things
the
noble
way
of
thinking
it
suggest
to
us
an
additional
pleasure
results
from
the
above
considerations
but
oh
the
pleasure
when
a
connoisseur
and
lover
of
art
has
before
him
a
picture
or
drawing
of
which
he
can
say
this
is
the
hand
these
are
the
thoughts
of
him
who
was
one
of
the
politest
gentlemen
that
ever
was
and
beloved
and
assisted
by
the
greatest
wits
and
the
greatest
men
then
in
rome
of
him
who
lived
in
great
fame
honour
and
magnificence
and
died
extremely
lamented
and
missed
a
cardinal
hat
only
by
dying
a
few
months
too
soon
but
was
particularly
esteemed
and
favoured
by
two
popes
the
only
ones
who
filled
the
chair
of
peter
in
his
time
and
as
great
men
as
ever
sat
there
since
that
apostle
if
at
least
he
ever
did
one
in
short
who
could
have
been
a
leonardo
a
michael
angelo
a
titian
a
correggio
a
parmegiano
an
annibal
a
rubens
or
any
other
whom
he
pleased
but
none
of
them
could
ever
have
been
a
raffaelle
the
same
writer
speaks
feelingly
of
the
change
in
the
style
of
different
artists
from
their
change
of
fortune
and
as
the
circumstances
are
little
known
i
will
quote
the
passage
relating
to
two
of
them
reni
from
a
affluence
of
fortune
the
just
reward
of
his
angelic
works
fell
to
a
condition
like
that
of
a
hired
servant
to
one
who
supplied
him
with
money
for
what
he
did
at
a
fixed
rate
and
that
by
his
being
bewitched
by
a
passion
for
gaming
whereby
he
lost
vast
sums
of
money
and
even
what
he
got
in
his
state
of
servitude
by
day
he
commonly
lost
at
night
nor
could
he
ever
be
cured
of
this
cursed
madness
those
of
his
works
therefore
which
he
did
in
this
unhappy
part
of
his
life
may
easily
be
conceived
to
be
in
a
different
style
to
what
he
did
before
which
in
some
things
that
is
in
the
airs
of
his
heads
in
the
gracious
kind
had
a
delicacy
in
them
peculiar
to
himself
and
almost
more
than
human
but
i
must
not
multiply
instance
variation
and
all
the
degrees
of
goodness
from
the
lowest
of
the
indifferent
up
to
the
sublime
i
can
produce
evident
proofs
of
this
in
so
easy
a
gradation
that
one
can
not
deny
but
that
he
that
did
this
might
do
that
and
very
probably
did
so
and
thus
one
may
ascend
and
descend
like
the
angels
on
jacob
ladder
whose
foot
was
upon
the
earth
but
its
top
reached
to
heaven
this
great
man
had
his
unlucky
circumstance
he
became
mad
after
the
philosopher
stone
and
did
but
very
little
in
painting
or
drawing
afterwards
judge
what
that
was
and
whether
there
was
not
an
alteration
of
style
from
what
he
had
done
before
this
devil
possessed
him
his
creditors
endeavoured
to
exorcise
him
and
did
him
some
good
for
he
set
himself
to
work
again
in
his
own
way
but
if
a
drawing
i
have
of
a
lucretia
be
that
he
made
for
his
last
picture
as
it
probably
is
vasari
says
that
was
the
subject
of
it
it
is
an
evident
proof
of
his
decay
it
is
good
indeed
but
it
wants
much
of
the
delicacy
which
is
commonly
seen
in
his
works
and
so
i
always
thought
before
i
knew
or
imagined
it
to
be
done
in
this
his
ebb
of
genius
we
have
had
two
artists
of
our
own
country
whose
fate
has
been
as
singular
as
it
was
hard
gandy
was
a
in
the
beginning
of
the
last
century
whose
heads
were
said
to
have
come
near
to
rembrandt
and
he
was
the
undoubted
prototype
of
sir
joshua
style
yet
his
name
has
scarcely
been
heard
of
and
his
reputation
like
his
works
never
extended
beyond
his
own
country
what
did
he
think
of
himself
and
of
a
fame
so
bounded
did
he
ever
dream
he
was
indeed
an
artist
or
how
did
this
feeling
in
him
differ
from
the
vulgar
conceit
of
the
lowest
pretender
the
best
known
of
his
works
is
a
portrait
of
an
alderman
of
exeter
in
some
public
building
in
that
city
poor
dan
stringer
forty
years
ago
he
had
the
finest
hand
and
the
clearest
eye
of
any
artist
of
his
time
and
produced
heads
and
drawings
that
would
not
have
disgraced
a
brighter
period
in
the
art
but
he
fell
a
martyr
like
burns
to
the
society
of
country
gentlemen
and
then
of
those
whom
they
would
consider
as
more
his
equals
i
saw
him
many
years
ago
when
he
treated
the
masterly
sketches
he
had
by
him
one
in
particular
of
the
group
of
citizens
in
shakespeare
the
tailor
news
as
of
his
genius
not
his
children
and
seemed
to
have
given
up
all
thoughts
of
his
art
whether
he
is
since
dead
i
can
not
say
the
world
do
not
so
much
as
know
that
he
ever
lived

on
the
past
and
future
i
have
naturally
but
little
imagination
and
am
not
of
a
very
sanguine
turn
of
mind
i
have
some
desire
to
enjoy
the
present
good
and
some
fondness
for
the
past
but
i
am
not
at
all
given
to
build
castles
in
the
air
nor
to
look
forward
with
much
confidence
or
hope
to
the
brilliant
illusions
held
out
by
the
future
hence
i
have
perhaps
been
led
to
form
a
theory
which
is
very
contrary
to
the
common
notions
and
feelings
on
the
subject
and
which
i
will
here
try
to
explain
as
well
as
i
can
when
sterne
in
the
told
the
french
minister
that
if
the
french
people
had
a
fault
it
was
that
they
were
too
serious
the
latter
replied
that
if
that
was
his
opinion
he
must
defend
it
with
all
his
might
for
he
would
have
all
the
world
against
him
so
i
shall
have
enough
to
do
to
get
well
through
the
present
argument
i
can
not
see
then
any
rational
or
logical
ground
for
that
mighty
difference
in
the
value
which
mankind
generally
set
upon
the
past
and
future
as
if
the
one
was
everything
and
the
other
nothing
of
no
consequence
whatever
on
the
other
hand
i
conceive
that
the
past
is
as
real
and
substantial
a
part
of
our
being
that
it
is
as
much
a
undeniable
consideration
in
the
estimate
of
human
life
as
the
future
can
possibly
be
to
say
that
the
past
is
of
no
importance
unworthy
of
a
moment
regard
because
it
has
gone
by
and
is
no
longer
anything
is
an
argument
that
can
not
be
held
to
any
purpose
for
if
the
past
has
ceased
to
be
and
is
therefore
to
be
accounted
nothing
in
the
scale
of
good
or
evil
the
future
is
yet
to
come
and
has
never
been
anything
should
any
one
choose
to
assert
that
the
present
only
is
of
any
value
in
a
strict
and
positive
sense
because
that
alone
has
a
real
existence
that
we
should
seize
the
instant
good
and
give
all
else
to
the
winds
i
can
understand
what
he
means
though
perhaps
he
does
not
himself
but
i
can
not
comprehend
how
this
distinction
between
that
which
has
a
downright
and
sensible
and
that
which
has
only
a
remote
and
airy
existence
can
be
applied
to
establish
the
preference
of
the
future
over
the
past
for
both
are
in
this
point
of
view
equally
ideal
absolutely
nothing
except
as
they
are
conceived
of
by
the
mind
eye
and
are
thus
rendered
present
to
the
thoughts
and
feelings
nay
the
one
is
even
more
imaginary
a
more
fantastic
creature
of
the
brain
than
the
other
and
the
interest
we
take
in
it
more
shadowy
and
gratuitous
for
the
future
on
which
we
lay
so
much
stress
may
never
come
to
pass
at
all
that
is
may
never
be
embodied
into
actual
existence
in
the
whole
course
of
events
whereas
the
past
has
certainly
existed
once
has
received
the
stamp
of
truth
and
left
an
image
of
itself
behind
it
is
so
far
then
placed
beyond
the
possibility
of
doubt
or
as
the
poet
has
it
those
joys
are
lodg
beyond
the
reach
of
fate
it
is
not
however
attempted
to
be
denied
that
though
the
future
is
nothing
at
present
and
has
no
immediate
interest
while
we
are
speaking
yet
it
is
of
the
utmost
consequence
in
itself
and
of
the
utmost
interest
to
the
individual
because
it
will
have
a
real
existence
and
we
have
an
idea
of
it
as
existing
in
time
to
come
well
then
the
past
also
has
no
real
existence
the
actual
sensation
and
the
interest
belonging
to
it
are
both
fled
but
it
a
real
existence
and
we
can
still
call
up
a
vivid
recollection
of
it
as
having
once
been
and
therefore
by
parity
of
reasoning
it
is
not
a
thing
perfectly
insignificant
in
itself
nor
wholly
indifferent
to
the
mind
whether
it
ever
was
or
not
oh
no
far
from
it
let
us
not
rashly
quit
our
hold
upon
the
past
when
perhaps
there
may
be
little
else
left
to
bind
us
to
existence
is
it
nothing
to
have
been
and
to
have
been
happy
or
miserable
or
is
it
a
matter
of
no
moment
to
think
whether
i
have
been
one
or
the
other
do
i
delude
myself
do
i
build
upon
a
shadow
or
a
dream
do
i
dress
up
in
the
gaudy
garb
of
idleness
and
folly
a
pure
fiction
with
nothing
answering
to
it
in
the
universe
of
things
and
the
records
of
truth
when
i
look
back
with
fond
delight
or
with
tender
regret
to
that
which
was
at
one
time
to
me
my
all
when
i
revive
the
glowing
image
of
some
bright
reality
the
thoughts
of
which
can
never
from
my
heart
do
i
then
muse
on
nothing
do
i
bend
my
eyes
on
nothing
when
i
turn
back
in
fancy
to
suns
and
skies
so
pure
that
lighted
up
my
early
path
is
it
to
think
of
nothing
to
set
an
idle
value
upon
nothing
to
think
of
all
that
has
happened
to
me
an
of
all
that
can
ever
interest
me
or
to
use
the
language
of
a
fine
poet
who
is
himself
among
my
earliest
and
not
least
painful
recollections
what
though
the
radiance
which
was
once
so
bright
be
now
for
ever
vanish
from
my
sight
though
nothing
can
bring
back
the
hour
of
glory
in
the
grass
of
splendour
in
the
yet
am
i
mocked
with
a
lie
when
i
venture
to
think
of
it
or
do
i
not
drink
in
and
breathe
again
the
air
of
heavenly
truth
when
i
but
its
footsteps
and
its
skirts
far
off
adore
i
can
not
say
with
the
same
poet
and
see
how
dark
the
backward
stream
a
little
moment
past
so
smiling
for
it
is
the
past
that
gives
me
most
delight
and
most
assurance
of
reality
what
to
me
constitutes
the
great
charm
of
the
of
rousseau
is
their
turning
so
much
upon
this
feeling
he
seems
to
gather
up
the
past
moments
of
his
being
like
drops
of
to
distil
a
precious
liquor
from
them
his
alternate
pleasures
and
pains
are
the
that
he
tells
over
and
piously
worships
he
makes
a
rosary
of
the
flowers
of
hope
and
fancy
that
strewed
his
earliest
years
when
he
begins
the
last
of
the
of
a
solitary
y
a
jour
des
paques
fleuris
cinquante
ans
depuis
que
premier
vu
madame
warens
what
a
yearning
of
the
soul
is
implied
in
that
short
sentence
was
all
that
had
happened
to
him
all
that
he
had
thought
and
felt
in
that
sad
interval
of
time
to
be
accounted
nothing
was
that
long
dim
faded
retrospect
of
years
happy
or
miserable
a
blank
that
was
not
to
make
his
eyes
fail
and
his
heart
faint
within
him
in
trying
to
grasp
all
that
had
once
filled
it
and
that
had
since
vanished
because
it
was
not
a
prospect
into
futurity
was
he
wrong
in
finding
more
to
interest
him
in
it
than
in
the
next
fifty
years
which
he
did
not
live
to
see
or
if
he
had
what
then
would
they
have
been
worth
thinking
of
compared
with
the
times
of
his
youth
of
his
first
meeting
with
madame
warens
with
those
times
which
he
has
traced
with
such
truth
and
pure
delight
our
heart
tables
when
the
life
of
life
was
flown
was
he
not
to
live
the
first
and
best
part
of
it
over
again
and
once
more
be
all
that
he
then
was
ye
woods
that
crown
the
clear
lone
brow
of
norman
court
why
do
i
revisit
ye
so
oft
and
feel
a
soothing
consciousness
of
your
presence
but
that
your
high
tops
waving
in
the
wind
recall
to
me
the
hours
and
years
that
are
for
ever
fled
that
ye
renew
in
ceaseless
murmurs
the
story
of
hopes
and
bitter
disappointment
that
in
your
solitudes
and
tangled
wilds
i
can
wander
and
lose
myself
as
i
wander
on
and
am
lost
in
the
solitude
of
my
own
heart
and
that
as
your
rustling
branches
give
the
loud
blast
to
the
waste
below
borne
on
the
thoughts
of
other
years
i
can
look
down
with
patient
anguish
at
the
cheerless
desolation
which
i
feel
within
without
that
face
pale
as
the
primrose
with
hyacinthine
locks
for
ever
shunning
and
for
ever
haunting
me
mocking
my
waking
thoughts
as
in
a
dream
without
that
smile
which
my
heart
could
never
turn
to
scorn
without
those
eyes
dark
with
their
own
lustre
still
bent
on
mine
and
drawing
the
soul
into
their
liquid
mazes
like
a
sea
of
love
without
that
name
trembling
in
fancy
ear
without
that
form
gliding
before
me
like
oread
or
dryad
in
fabled
groves
what
should
i
do
how
pass
away
the
listless
hours
then
wave
wave
on
ye
woods
of
tuderley
and
lift
your
high
tops
in
the
air
my
sighs
and
vows
uttered
by
our
mystic
voice
breathe
into
me
my
former
being
and
enable
me
to
bear
the
thing
i
am
the
objects
that
we
have
known
in
better
days
are
the
main
props
that
sustain
the
weight
of
our
affections
and
give
us
strength
to
await
our
future
lot
the
future
is
like
a
dead
wall
or
a
thick
mist
hiding
all
objects
from
our
view
the
past
is
alive
and
stirring
with
objects
bright
or
solemn
and
of
unfading
interest
what
is
it
in
fact
that
we
recur
to
oftenest
what
subjects
do
we
think
or
talk
of
not
the
ignorant
future
but
the
past
othello
the
moor
of
venice
amused
himself
and
his
hearers
at
the
house
of
signor
brabantio
by
through
the
story
of
his
life
even
from
his
boyish
days
and
oft
them
of
their
tears
when
he
did
speak
of
some
disastrous
stroke
which
his
youth
suffered
this
plan
of
ingratiating
himself
would
not
have
answered
if
the
past
had
been
like
the
contents
of
an
old
almanac
of
no
use
but
to
be
thrown
aside
and
forgotten
what
a
blank
for
instance
does
the
history
of
the
world
for
the
next
six
thousand
years
present
to
the
mind
compared
with
that
of
the
last
all
that
strikes
the
imagination
or
excites
any
interest
in
the
mighty
scene
is
has
neither
in
itself
then
nor
as
a
subject
of
general
contemplation
has
the
future
any
advantage
over
the
past
but
with
respect
to
our
grosser
passions
and
pursuits
it
has
as
far
as
regards
the
appeal
to
the
understanding
or
the
imagination
the
past
is
just
as
good
as
real
of
as
much
intrinsic
and
ostensible
value
as
the
future
but
there
is
another
principle
in
the
human
mind
the
principle
of
action
or
will
and
of
this
the
past
has
no
hold
the
future
engrosses
it
entirely
to
itself
it
is
this
strong
lever
of
the
affections
that
gives
so
powerful
a
bias
to
our
sentiments
on
this
subject
and
violently
transposes
the
natural
order
of
our
associations
we
regret
the
pleasures
we
have
lost
and
eagerly
anticipate
those
which
are
to
come
we
dwell
with
satisfaction
on
the
evils
from
which
we
have
escaped
meminisse
and
dread
future
pain
the
good
that
is
past
is
in
this
sense
like
money
that
is
spent
which
is
of
no
further
use
and
about
which
we
give
ourselves
little
concern
the
good
we
expect
is
like
a
store
yet
untouched
and
in
the
enjoyment
of
which
we
promise
ourselves
infinite
gratification
what
has
happened
to
us
we
think
of
no
consequence
what
is
to
happen
to
us
of
the
greatest
why
so
simply
because
the
one
is
still
in
our
power
and
the
other
not
because
the
efforts
of
the
will
to
bring
any
object
to
pass
or
to
prevent
it
strengthen
our
attachment
or
aversion
to
that
object
because
the
pains
and
attention
bestowed
upon
anything
add
to
our
interest
in
it
and
because
the
habitual
and
earnest
pursuit
of
any
end
redoubles
the
ardour
of
our
expectations
and
converts
the
speculative
and
indolent
satisfaction
we
might
otherwise
feel
in
it
into
real
passion
our
regrets
anxiety
and
wishes
are
thrown
away
upon
the
past
but
the
insisting
on
the
importance
of
the
future
is
of
the
utmost
use
in
aiding
our
resolutions
and
stimulating
our
exertions
if
the
future
were
no
more
amenable
to
our
wills
than
the
past
if
our
precautions
our
sanguine
schemes
our
hopes
and
fears
were
of
as
little
avail
in
the
one
case
as
the
other
if
we
could
neither
soften
our
minds
to
pleasure
nor
steel
our
fortitude
to
the
resistance
of
pain
beforehand
if
all
objects
drifted
along
by
us
like
straws
or
pieces
of
wood
in
a
river
the
will
being
purely
passive
and
as
little
able
to
avert
the
future
as
to
arrest
the
past
we
should
in
that
case
be
equally
indifferent
to
both
that
is
we
should
consider
each
as
they
affected
the
thoughts
and
imagination
with
certain
sentiments
of
approbation
or
regret
but
without
the
importunity
of
action
the
irritation
of
the
will
throwing
the
whole
weight
of
passion
and
prejudice
into
one
scale
and
leaving
the
other
quite
empty
while
the
blow
is
coming
we
prepare
to
meet
it
we
think
to
ward
off
or
break
its
force
we
arm
ourselves
with
patience
to
endure
what
can
not
be
avoided
we
agitate
ourselves
with
fifty
needless
alarms
about
it
but
when
the
blow
is
struck
the
pang
is
over
the
struggle
is
no
longer
necessary
and
we
cease
to
harass
or
torment
ourselves
about
it
more
than
we
can
help
it
is
not
that
the
one
belongs
to
the
future
and
the
other
to
time
past
but
that
the
one
is
a
subject
of
action
of
uneasy
apprehension
of
strong
passion
and
that
the
other
has
passed
wholly
out
of
the
sphere
of
action
into
the
region
of
calm
contemplation
and
majestic
pains
it
would
not
give
a
man
more
concern
to
know
that
he
should
be
put
to
the
rack
a
year
hence
than
to
recollect
that
he
had
been
put
to
it
a
year
ago
but
that
he
hopes
to
avoid
the
one
whereas
he
must
sit
down
patiently
under
the
consciousness
of
the
other
in
this
hope
he
wears
himself
out
in
vain
struggles
with
fate
and
puts
himself
to
the
rack
of
his
imagination
every
day
he
has
to
live
in
the
meanwhile
when
the
event
is
so
remote
or
so
independent
of
the
will
as
to
set
aside
the
necessity
of
immediate
action
or
to
baffle
all
attempts
to
defeat
it
it
gives
us
little
more
disturbance
or
emotion
than
if
it
had
already
taken
place
or
were
something
to
happen
in
another
state
of
being
or
to
an
indifferent
person
criminals
are
observed
to
grow
more
anxious
as
their
trial
approaches
but
after
their
sentence
is
passed
they
become
tolerably
resigned
and
generally
sleep
sound
the
night
before
its
execution
it
in
some
measure
confirms
this
theory
that
men
attach
more
or
less
importance
to
past
and
future
events
according
as
they
are
more
or
less
engaged
in
action
and
the
busy
scenes
of
life
those
who
have
a
fortune
to
make
or
are
in
pursuit
of
rank
and
power
think
little
of
the
past
for
it
does
not
contribute
greatly
to
their
views
those
who
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
think
take
nearly
the
same
interest
in
the
past
as
in
the
future
the
contemplation
of
the
one
is
as
delightful
and
real
as
that
of
the
other
the
season
of
hope
has
an
end
but
the
remembrance
of
it
is
left
the
past
still
lives
in
the
memory
of
those
who
have
leisure
to
look
back
upon
the
way
that
they
have
trod
and
can
from
it
that
may
make
them
less
forlorn
the
turbulence
of
action
and
uneasiness
of
desire
must
point
to
the
future
it
is
only
in
the
quiet
innocence
of
shepherds
in
the
simplicity
of
pastoral
ages
that
a
tomb
was
found
with
this
inscription
also
was
an
arcadian
though
i
by
no
means
think
that
our
habitual
attachment
to
life
is
in
exact
proportion
to
the
value
of
the
gift
yet
i
am
not
one
of
those
splenetic
persons
who
affect
to
think
it
of
no
value
at
all
peu
de
chose
est
la
vie
is
an
exclamation
in
the
mouths
of
moralists
and
philosophers
to
which
i
can
not
agree
it
is
little
it
is
short
it
is
not
worth
having
if
we
take
the
last
hour
and
leave
out
all
that
has
gone
before
which
has
been
one
way
of
looking
at
the
subject
such
calculators
seem
to
say
that
life
is
nothing
when
it
is
over
and
that
may
in
their
sense
be
true
if
the
old
rule
were
to
be
made
absolute
and
no
one
could
be
pronounced
fortunate
till
the
day
of
his
death
there
are
few
among
us
whose
existence
would
upon
those
conditions
be
much
to
be
envied
but
this
is
not
a
fair
view
of
the
case
a
man
life
is
his
whole
life
not
the
last
glimmering
snuff
of
the
candle
and
this
i
say
is
considerable
and
not
a
whether
we
regard
its
pleasures
or
its
pains
to
draw
a
peevish
conclus
desires
or
forgetful
indifference
is
about
as
reasonable
as
to
say
a
man
never
was
young
because
he
has
grown
old
or
never
lived
because
he
is
now
dead
the
length
or
agreeableness
of
a
journey
does
not
depend
on
the
few
last
steps
of
it
nor
is
the
size
of
a
building
to
be
judged
of
from
the
last
stone
that
is
added
to
it
it
is
neither
the
first
nor
last
hour
of
our
existence
but
the
space
that
parts
these
two
not
our
exit
nor
our
entrance
upon
the
stage
but
what
we
do
feel
and
think
while
there
that
we
are
to
attend
to
in
pronouncing
sentence
upon
it
indeed
it
would
be
easy
to
show
that
it
is
the
very
extent
of
human
life
the
infinite
number
of
things
contained
in
it
its
contradictory
and
fluctuating
interests
the
transition
from
one
situation
to
another
the
hours
months
years
spent
in
one
fond
pursuit
after
another
that
it
is
in
a
word
the
length
of
our
common
journey
and
the
quantity
of
events
crowded
into
it
that
baffling
the
grasp
of
our
actual
perception
make
it
slide
from
our
memory
and
dwindle
into
nothing
in
its
own
perspective
it
is
too
mighty
for
us
and
we
say
it
is
nothing
it
is
a
speck
in
our
fancy
and
yet
what
canvas
would
be
big
enough
to
hold
its
striking
groups
its
endless
subjects
it
is
light
as
vanity
and
yet
if
all
its
weary
moments
if
all
its
head
and
heart
aches
were
compressed
into
one
what
fortitude
would
not
be
overwhelmed
with
the
blow
what
a
huge
heap
a
dumb
heap
of
wishes
thoughts
feelings
anxious
cares
soothing
hopes
loves
joys
friendships
it
is
composed
of
how
many
ideas
and
trains
of
sentiment
long
and
deep
and
intense
often
pass
through
the
mind
in
only
one
day
thinking
or
reading
for
instance
how
many
such
days
are
there
in
a
year
how
many
years
in
a
long
life
still
occupied
with
something
interesting
still
recalling
some
old
impression
still
recurring
to
some
difficult
question
and
making
progress
in
it
every
step
accompanied
with
a
sense
of
power
and
every
moment
conscious
of
high
endeavour
or
the
glad
success
for
the
mind
seizes
only
on
that
which
keeps
it
employed
and
is
wound
up
to
a
certain
pitch
of
pleasurable
excitement
or
lively
solicitude
by
the
necessity
of
its
own
nature
the
division
of
the
map
of
life
into
its
component
parts
is
beautifully
made
by
king
henry
vi
oh
god
methinks
it
were
a
happy
life
to
be
no
better
than
a
homely
swain
to
sit
upon
a
hill
as
i
do
now
to
carve
out
dials
quaintly
point
by
point
thereby
to
see
the
minutes
how
they
run
how
many
make
the
hour
full
complete
how
many
hours
bring
about
the
day
how
many
days
will
finish
up
the
year
how
many
years
a
mortal
man
may
live
when
this
is
known
then
to
divide
the
times
so
many
hours
must
i
tend
my
flock
so
many
hours
must
i
take
my
rest
so
many
hours
must
i
contemplate
so
many
hours
must
i
sport
myself
so
many
days
my
ewes
have
been
with
young
so
many
weeks
ere
the
poor
fools
will
yean
so
many
months
ere
i
shall
shear
the
fleece
so
many
minutes
hours
weeks
months
and
years
past
over
to
the
end
they
were
created
would
bring
grey
hairs
unto
a
quiet
grave
i
myself
am
neither
a
king
nor
a
shepherd
books
have
been
my
fleecy
charge
and
my
thoughts
have
been
my
subjects
but
these
have
found
me
sufficient
employment
at
the
time
and
enough
to
think
of
for
the
time
to
come
the
passions
contract
and
warp
the
natural
progress
of
life
they
paralyse
all
of
it
that
is
not
devoted
to
their
tyranny
and
caprice
this
makes
the
difference
between
the
laughing
innocence
of
childhood
the
pleasantness
of
youth
and
the
crabbedness
of
age
a
load
of
cares
lies
like
a
weight
of
guilt
upon
the
mind
so
that
a
man
of
business
often
has
all
the
air
the
distraction
and
restlessness
and
hurry
of
feeling
of
a
criminal
a
knowledge
of
the
world
takes
away
the
freedom
and
simplicity
of
thought
as
effectually
as
the
contagion
of
its
example
the
artlessness
and
candour
of
our
early
years
are
open
to
all
impressions
alike
because
the
mind
is
not
clogged
and
preoccupied
with
other
objects
our
pleasures
and
our
pains
come
single
make
room
for
one
another
and
the
spring
of
the
mind
is
fresh
and
unbroken
its
aspect
clear
and
unsullied
hence
tear
forgot
as
soon
as
shed
the
sunshine
of
the
breast
but
as
we
advance
farther
the
will
gets
greater
head
we
form
violent
antipathies
and
indulge
exclusive
preferences
we
make
up
our
minds
to
some
one
thing
and
if
we
can
not
have
that
will
have
nothing
we
are
wedded
to
opinion
to
fancy
to
prejudice
which
destroys
the
soundness
of
our
judgments
and
the
serenity
and
buoyancy
of
our
feelings
the
chain
of
habit
coils
itself
round
the
heart
like
a
serpent
to
gnaw
and
stifle
it
it
grows
rigid
and
callous
and
for
the
softness
and
elasticity
of
childhood
full
of
proud
flesh
and
obstinate
tumours
the
violence
and
perversity
of
our
passions
come
in
more
and
more
to
overlay
our
natural
sensibility
and
affections
and
we
screw
ourselves
up
to
aim
only
at
those
things
which
are
neither
desirable
nor
practicable
thus
life
passes
away
in
the
feverish
irritation
of
pursuit
and
the
certainty
of
disappointment
by
degrees
nothing
but
this
morbid
state
of
feeling
satisfies
us
and
all
common
pleasures
and
cheap
amusements
are
sacrificed
to
the
demon
of
ambition
avarice
or
dissipation
the
machine
is
overwrought
the
parching
heat
of
the
veins
dries
up
and
withers
the
flowers
of
love
hope
and
joy
and
any
pause
any
release
from
the
rack
of
ecstasy
on
which
we
are
stretched
seems
more
insupportable
than
the
pangs
which
we
endure
we
are
suspended
between
tormenting
desires
and
the
horrors
of
the
impulse
of
the
will
like
the
wheels
of
a
carriage
going
down
hill
becomes
too
strong
for
the
driver
reason
and
can
not
be
stopped
nor
kept
within
bounds
some
idea
some
fancy
takes
possession
of
the
brain
and
however
ridiculous
however
distressing
however
ruinous
haunts
us
by
a
sort
of
fascination
through
life
not
only
is
this
principle
of
excessive
irritability
to
be
seen
at
work
in
our
more
turbulent
passions
and
pursuits
but
even
in
the
formal
study
of
arts
and
sciences
the
same
thing
takes
place
and
undermines
the
repose
and
happiness
of
life
the
eagerness
of
pursuit
overcomes
the
satisfaction
to
result
from
the
accomplishment
the
mind
is
overstrained
to
attain
its
purpose
and
when
it
is
attained
the
ease
and
alacrity
necessary
to
enjoy
it
are
gone
the
irritation
of
action
does
not
cease
and
go
down
with
the
occasion
for
it
but
we
are
first
uneasy
to
get
to
the
end
of
our
work
and
then
uneasy
for
want
of
something
to
do
the
ferment
of
the
brain
does
not
of
itself
subside
into
pleasure
and
soft
repose
hence
the
disposition
to
strong
stimuli
observable
in
persons
of
much
intellectual
exertion
to
allay
and
carry
off
the
the
poets

is
recorded
by

of
their
singular
and
difficult

the

running
in
their

in
spite
of
themselves
and

not
let
them
rest
mechanics
and
labouring
people
never
know
what
to
do
with
themselves
on
a
sunday
though
they
return
to
their
work
with
greater
spirit
for
the
relief
and
look
forward
to
it
with
pleasure
all
the
week
sir
joshua
reynolds
was
never
comfortable
out
of
his
and
died
of
chagrin
and
regret
because
he
could
not
paint
on
to
the
last
moment
of
his
life
he
used
to
say
that
he
could
go
on
retouching
a
picture
for
ever
as
long
as
it
stood
on
his
easel
but
as
soon
as
it
was
once
fairly
out
of
the
house
he
never
wished
to
see
it
again
an
ingenious
artist
of
our
own
time
has
been
heard
to
declare
that
if
ever
the
devil
got
him
into
his
clutches
he
would
set
him
to
copy
his
own
pictures
thus
secure
retrospect
to
what
is
done
is
nothing
while
the
anxious
uneasy
looking
forward
to
what
is
to
come
is
everything
we
are
afraid
to
dwell
upon
the
past
lest
it
should
retard
our
future
progress
the
indulgence
of
ease
is
fatal
to
excellence
and
to
succeed
in
life
we
lose
the
ends
of
being

to

iii
if
we
take
away
from
the
the
moment
that
is
just
by
and
the
moment
that
is
next
to
come
how
much
of
it
will
be
left
for
this
plain
practical
theory
to
rest
upon
their
solid
basis
of
sense
and
reality
will
reduce
itself
to
a
pin
point
a
hair
line
on
which
our
moral
will
have
some
difficulty
to
maintain
their
footing
without
falling
over
on
either
side
a
treatise
on
the
millennium
is
dull
but
who
was
ever
weary
of
reading
the
fables
of
the
golden
age
on
my
once
observing
i
should
like
to
have
been
claude
a
person
said
should
not
for
that
then
by
this
time
it
would
have
been
all
over
with
them
as
if
it
could
possibly
signify
when
we
live
save
and
excepting
the
present
minute
or
as
if
the
value
of
human
life
decreased
or
increased
with
successive
centuries
at
that
rate
we
had
better
have
our
life
still
to
come
at
some
future
period
and
so
postpone
our
existence
century
after
century
in
like
manner
though
we
know
that
an
event
must
have
taken
place
at
a
distance
long
before
we
can
hear
the
result
yet
as
long
as
we
remain
in
ignorance
of
it
we
irritate
ourselves
about
it
and
suffer
all
the
agonies
of
suspense
as
if
it
was
still
to
come
but
as
soon
as
our
uncertainty
is
removed
our
fretful
impatience
vanishes
we
resign
ourselves
to
fate
and
make
up
our
minds
to
what
has
happened
as
well
as
we
can
essay
iv
on
genius
and
common
sense
we
hear
it
maintained
by
people
of
more
gravity
than
understanding
that
genius
and
taste
are
strictly
reducible
to
rules
and
that
there
is
a
rule
for
everything
so
far
is
it
from
being
true
that
the
finest
breath
of
fancy
is
a
definable
thing
that
the
plainest
common
sense
is
only
what
locke
would
have
called
a
subject
to
a
particular
sort
of
acquired
and
undefinable
tact
it
is
asked
if
you
do
not
know
the
rule
by
which
a
thing
is
done
how
can
you
be
sure
of
doing
it
a
second
time
and
the
answer
is
if
you
do
not
know
the
muscles
by
the
help
of
which
you
walk
how
is
it
you
do
not
fall
down
at
every
step
you
take
in
art
in
taste
in
life
in
speech
you
decide
from
feeling
and
not
from
reason
that
is
from
the
impression
of
a
number
of
things
on
the
mind
from
which
impression
is
true
and
well
founded
though
you
may
not
be
able
to
analyse
or
account
for
it
in
the
several
particulars
in
a
gesture
you
use
in
a
look
you
see
in
a
tone
you
hear
you
judge
of
the
expression
propriety
and
meaning
from
habit
not
from
reason
or
rules
that
is
to
say
from
innumerable
instances
of
like
gestures
looks
and
tones
in
innumerable
other
circumstances
variously
modified
which
are
too
many
and
too
refined
to
be
all
distinctly
recollected
but
which
do
not
therefore
operate
the
less
powerfully
upon
the
mind
and
eye
of
taste
shall
we
say
that
these
impressions
the
immediate
stamp
of
nature
do
not
operate
in
a
given
manner
till
they
are
classified
and
reduced
to
rules
or
is
not
the
rule
itself
grounded
upon
the
truth
and
certainty
of
that
natural
operation
how
then
can
the
distinction
of
the
understanding
as
to
the
manner
in
which
they
operate
be
necessary
to
their
producing
their
due
and
uniform
effect
upon
the
mind
if
certain
effects
did
not
regularly
arise
out
of
certain
causes
in
mind
as
well
as
matter
there
could
be
no
rule
given
for
them
nature
does
not
follow
the
rule
but
suggests
it
reason
is
the
interpreter
and
critic
of
nature
and
genius
not
their
and
judge
he
must
be
a
poor
creature
indeed
whose
practical
convictions
do
not
in
almost
all
cases
outrun
his
deliberate
understanding
or
who
does
not
feel
and
know
much
more
than
he
can
give
a
reason
for
hence
the
distinction
between
eloquence
and
wisdom
between
ingenuity
and
common
sense
a
man
may
be
dexterous
and
able
in
explaining
the
grounds
of
his
opinions
and
yet
may
be
a
mere
sophist
because
he
only
sees
of
a
subject
another
may
feel
the
whole
weight
of
a
question
nothing
relating
to
it
may
be
lost
upon
him
and
yet
he
may
be
able
to
give
no
account
of
the
manner
in
which
it
affects
him
or
to
drag
his
reasons
from
their
silent
this
last
will
be
a
wise
man
though
neither
a
logician
nor
rhetorician
goldsmith
was
a
fool
to
johnson
in
argument
that
is
in
assigning
the
specific
grounds
of
his
opinions
johnson
was
a
fool
to
goldsmith
in
the
fine
tact
the
airy
intuitive
faculty
with
which
he
skimmed
the
surfaces
of
things
and
unconsciously
formed
his
opinions
common
sense
is
the
just
result
of
the
sum
total
of
such
unconscious
impressions
in
the
ordinary
occurrences
of
life
as
they
are
treasured
up
in
the
memory
and
called
out
by
the
occasion
genius
and
taste
depend
much
upon
the
same
principle
exercised
on
loftier
ground
and
in
more
unusual
combinations
i
am
glad
to
shelter
myself
from
the
charge
of
affectation
or
singularity
in
this
view
of
an
often
debated
but
point
by
quoting
a
passage
from
sir
joshua
reynolds
which
is
full
and
i
think
conclusive
to
the
purpose
he
says
observe
as
a
fundamental
ground
common
to
all
the
arts
with
which
we
have
any
concern
in
this
discourse
that
they
address
themselves
only
to
two
faculties
of
the
mind
its
imagination
and
its
sensibility
theories
which
attempt
to
direct
or
to
control
the
art
upon
any
principles
falsely
called
rational
which
we
form
to
ourselves
upon
a
supposition
of
what
ought
in
reason
to
be
the
end
or
means
of
art
independent
of
the
known
first
effect
produced
by
objects
on
the
imagination
must
be
false
and
delusive
for
though
it
may
appear
bold
to
say
it
the
imagination
is
here
the
residence
of
truth
if
the
imagination
be
affected
the
conclusion
is
fairly
drawn
if
it
be
not
affected
the
reasoning
is
erroneous
because
the
end
is
not
obtained
the
effect
itself
being
the
test
and
the
only
test
of
the
truth
and
efficacy
of
the
means
is
in
the
commerce
of
life
as
in
art
a
sagacity
which
is
far
from
being
contradictory
to
right
reason
and
is
superior
to
any
occasional
exercise
of
that
faculty
which
supersedes
it
and
does
not
wait
for
the
slow
progress
of
deduction
but
goes
at
once
by
what
appears
a
kind
of
intuition
to
the
conclusion
a
man
endowed
with
this
faculty
feels
and
acknowledges
the
truth
though
it
is
not
always
in
his
power
perhaps
to
give
a
reason
for
it
because
he
can
not
recollect
and
bring
before
him
all
the
materials
that
gave
birth
to
his
opinion
for
very
many
and
very
intricate
considerations
may
unite
to
form
the
principle
even
of
small
and
minute
parts
involved
in
or
dependent
on
a
great
many
things
though
these
in
process
of
time
are
forgotten
the
right
impression
still
remains
fixed
in
his
mind
impression
is
the
result
of
the
accumulated
experience
of
our
whole
life
and
has
been
collected
we
do
not
always
know
how
or
when
but
this
mass
of
collective
observation
however
acquired
ought
to
prevail
over
that
reason
which
however
powerfully
exerted
on
any
particular
occasion
will
probably
comprehend
but
a
partial
view
of
the
subject
and
our
conduct
in
life
as
well
as
in
the
arts
is
or
ought
to
be
generally
governed
by
this
habitual
reason
it
is
our
happiness
that
we
are
enabled
to
draw
on
such
funds
if
we
were
obliged
to
enter
into
a
theoretical
deliberation
on
every
occasion
before
we
act
life
would
be
at
a
stand
and
art
would
be
impracticable
appears
to
me
therefore
continues
sir
joshua
our
first
thoughts
that
is
the
effect
which
any
thing
produces
on
our
minds
on
its
first
appearance
is
never
to
be
forgotten
and
it
demands
for
that
reason
because
it
is
the
first
to
be
laid
up
with
care
if
this
be
not
done
the
artist
may
happen
to
impose
on
himself
by
partial
reasoning
by
a
cold
consideration
of
those
animated
thoughts
which
proceed
not
perhaps
from
caprice
or
rashness
as
he
may
afterwards
conceit
but
from
the
fulness
of
his
mind
enriched
with
the
copious
stores
of
all
the
various
inventions
which
he
had
ever
seen
or
had
ever
passed
in
his
mind
these
ideas
are
infused
into
his
design
without
any
conscious
effort
but
if
he
be
not
on
his
guard
he
may
reconsider
and
correct
them
till
the
whole
matter
is
reduced
to
a
commonplace
invention
is
sometimes
the
effect
of
what
i
mean
to
caution
you
against
that
is
to
say
an
unfounded
distrust
of
the
imagination
and
feeling
in
favour
of
narrow
partial
confined
argumentative
theories
and
of
principles
that
seem
to
apply
to
the
design
in
hand
without
considering
those
general
impressions
on
the
fancy
in
which
real
principles
of
and
of
much
more
weight
and
importance
are
involved
and
as
it
were
lie
hid
under
the
appearance
of
a
sort
of
vulgar
sentiment
reason
without
doubt
must
ultimately
determine
everything
at
this
minute
it
is
required
to
inform
us
when
that
very
reason
is
to
give
way
to
feeling
burke
by
whom
the
foregoing
train
of
thinking
was
probably
suggested
has
insisted
on
the
same
thing
and
made
rather
a
perverse
use
of
it
in
several
parts
of
his
on
the
french
and
windham
in
one
of
his
has
clenched
it
into
an
aphorism
is
nothing
so
true
as
habit
once
more
i
would
say
common
sense
is
tacit
reason
conscience
is
the
same
tacit
sense
of
right
and
wrong
or
the
impression
of
our
moral
experience
and
moral
apprehensions
on
the
mind
which
because
it
works
unseen
yet
certainly
we
suppose
to
be
an
instinct
implanted
in
the
mind
as
we
sometimes
attribute
the
violent
operations
of
our
passions
of
which
we
can
neither
trace
the
source
nor
assign
the
reason
to
the
instigation
of
the
devil
i
shall
here
try
to
go
more
at
large
into
this
subject
and
to
give
such
instances
and
illustrations
of
it
as
occur
to
me
one
of
the
persons
who
had
rendered
themselves
obnoxious
to
government
and
been
included
in
a
charge
for
high
treason
in
the
year
had
retired
soon
after
into
wales
to
write
an
epic
poem
and
enjoy
the
luxuries
of
a
rural
life
in
his
peregrinations
through
that
beautiful
scenery
he
had
arrived
one
fine
morning
at
the
inn
at
llangollen
in
the
romantic
valley
of
that
name
he
had
ordered
his
breakfast
and
was
sitting
at
the
window
in
all
the
dalliance
of
expectation
when
a
face
passed
of
which
he
took
no
notice
at
the
instant
but
when
his
breakfast
was
brought
in
presently
after
he
found
his
appetite
for
it
gone
the
day
had
lost
its
freshness
in
his
eye
he
was
uneasy
and
spiritless
and
without
any
cause
that
he
could
discover
a
total
change
had
taken
place
in
his
feelings
while
he
was
trying
to
account
for
this
odd
circumstance
the
same
face
passed
again
it
was
the
face
of
taylor
the
spy
and
he
was
longer
at
a
loss
to
explain
the
difficulty
he
had
before
caught
only
a
transient
glimpse
a
passing
of
the
face
but
though
this
was
not
sufficient
to
awaken
a
distinct
idea
in
his
memory
his
feelings
quicker
and
surer
had
taken
the
alarm
a
string
had
been
touched
that
gave
a
jar
to
his
whole
frame
and
would
not
let
him
rest
though
he
could
not
at
all
tell
what
was
the
matter
with
him
to
the
flitting
shadowy
profile
that
had
glided
by
his
window
was
linked
unconsciously
and
mysteriously
but
inseparably
the
impression
of
the
trains
that
had
been
laid
for
him
by
this
person
in
this
brief
moment
in
this
dim
illegible
of
the
mind
he
had
just
escaped
the
speeches
of
the
attorney
and
over
again
the
gaunt
figure
of
pitt
glared
by
him
the
walls
of
a
prison
enclosed
him
and
he
felt
the
hands
of
the
executioner
near
him
without
knowing
it
till
the
tremor
and
disorder
of
his
nerves
gave
information
to
his
reasoning
faculties
that
all
was
not
well
within
that
is
the
same
state
of
mind
was
recalled
by
one
circumstance
in
the
series
of
association
that
had
been
produced
by
the
whole
set
of
circumstances
at
the
time
though
the
manner
in
which
this
was
done
was
not
immediately
perceptible
in
other
words
the
feeling
of
pleasure
or
pain
of
good
or
evil
is
revived
and
acts
instantaneously
upon
the
mind
before
we
have
time
to
recollect
the
precise
objects
which
have
originally
given
birth
to
it
the
incident
here
mentioned
was
merely
then
one
case
of
what
the
learned
understand
by
the
of
but
all
that
is
meant
by
feeling
or
common
sense
is
nothing
but
the
different
cases
of
the
association
of
ideas
more
or
less
true
to
the
impression
of
the
original
circumstances
as
reason
begins
with
the
more
formal
development
of
those
circumstances
or
pretends
to
account
for
the
different
cases
of
the
association
of
ideas
but
it
does
not
follow
that
the
dumb
and
silent
pleading
of
the
former
though
sometimes
nay
often
mistaken
is
less
true
than
that
of
its
babbling
interpreter
or
that
we
are
never
to
trust
its
dictates
without
consulting
the
express
authority
of
reason
both
are
imperfect
both
are
useful
in
their
way
and
therefore
both
are
best
together
to
correct
or
to
confirm
one
another
it
does
not
appear
that
in
the
singular
instance
above
mentioned
the
sudden
impression
on
the
mind
was
superstition
or
fancy
though
it
might
have
been
thought
so
had
it
not
been
proved
by
the
event
to
have
a
real
physical
and
moral
cause
had
not
the
same
face
returned
again
the
doubt
would
never
have
been
properly
cleared
up
but
would
have
remained
a
puzzle
ever
after
or
perhaps
have
been
soon
by
the
law
of
association
as
laid
down
by
physiologists
any
impression
in
a
series
can
recall
any
other
impression
in
that
series
without
going
through
the
whole
in
order
so
that
the
mind
drops
the
intermediate
links
and
passes
on
rapidly
and
by
stealth
to
the
more
striking
effects
of
pleasure
or
pain
which
have
naturally
taken
the
strongest
hold
of
it
by
doing
this
habitually
and
skillfully
with
respect
to
the
various
impressions
and
circumstances
with
which
our
experience
makes
us
acquainted
it
forms
a
series
of
unpremeditated
conclusions
on
almost
all
subjects
that
can
be
brought
before
it
as
just
as
they
are
of
ready
application
to
human
life
and
common
sense
is
the
name
of
this
body
of
unassuming
but
practical
wisdom
common
sense
however
is
an
impartial
instinctive
result
of
truth
and
nature
and
will
therefore
bear
the
test
and
abide
the
scrutiny
of
the
most
severe
and
patient
reasoning
it
is
indeed
incomplete
without
it
by
ingrafting
reason
on
feeling
we
assurance
double
sure
is
the
last
that
makes
up
the
arch
then
stands
it
a
triumphal
mark
then
men
observe
the
strength
the
height
the
why
and
when
it
was
erected
and
still
walking
under
meet
some
new
matter
to
look
up
and
wonder
but
reason
not
employed
to
interpret
nature
and
to
improve
and
perfect
common
sense
and
experience
is
for
the
most
part
a
building
without
a
foundation
the
criticism
exercised
by
reason
then
on
common
sense
may
be
as
severe
as
it
pleases
but
it
must
be
as
patient
as
it
is
severe
hasty
dogmatical
reason
is
worse
than
idle
fancy
or
bigoted
prejudice
it
is
systematic
ostentatious
in
error
closes
up
the
avenues
of
knowledge
and
the
gates
of
wisdom
on
mankind
it
is
not
enough
to
show
that
there
is
no
reason
for
a
thing
that
we
do
not
see
the
reason
of
it
if
the
common
feeling
if
the
involuntary
prejudice
sets
in
strong
in
favour
of
it
if
in
spite
of
all
we
can
do
there
is
a
lurking
suspicion
on
the
side
of
our
first
impressions
we
must
try
again
and
believe
that
truth
is
mightier
than
we
so
in
ordering
a
definition
of
any
subject
if
we
feel
a
misgiving
that
there
is
any
fact
or
circumstance
emitted
but
of
which
we
have
only
a
vague
apprehension
like
a
name
we
can
not
recollect
we
must
ask
for
more
time
and
not
cut
the
matter
short
by
an
arrogant
assumption
of
the
point
in
dispute
common
sense
thus
acts
as
a
on
sophistry
and
suspends
our
rash
and
superficial
judgments
on
the
other
hand
if
not
only
no
reason
can
be
given
for
a
thing
but
every
reason
is
clear
against
it
and
we
can
account
from
ignorance
from
authority
from
interest
from
different
causes
for
the
prevalence
of
an
opinion
or
sentiment
then
we
have
a
right
to
conclude
that
we
have
mistaken
a
prejudice
for
an
instinct
or
have
confounded
a
false
and
partial
impression
with
the
fair
and
unavoidable
inference
from
general
observation
burke
said
that
we
ought
not
to
reject
every
prejudice
but
should
separate
the
husk
of
prejudice
from
the
truth
it
encloses
and
so
try
to
get
at
the
kernel
within
and
thus
far
he
was
right
but
he
was
wrong
in
insisting
that
we
are
to
cherish
our
prejudices
they
are
prejudices
for
if
all
are
well
founded
there
is
no
occasion
to
inquire
into
their
origin
or
use
and
he
who
sets
out
to
philosophise
upon
them
or
make
the
separation
burke
talks
of
in
this
spirit
and
with
this
previous
determination
will
be
very
likely
to
mistake
a
maggot
or
a
rotten
canker
for
the
precious
kernel
of
truth
as
was
indeed
the
case
with
our
political
sophist
there
is
nothing
more
distinct
than
common
sense
and
vulgar
opinion
common
sense
is
only
a
judge
of
things
that
fall
under
common
observation
or
immediately
come
home
to
the
business
and
bosoms
of
men
this
is
of
the
very
essence
of
its
principle
the
basis
of
its
pretensions
it
rests
upon
the
simple
process
of
feeling
it
anchors
in
experience
it
is
not
nor
it
can
not
be
the
test
of
abstract
speculative
opinions
but
half
the
opinions
and
prejudices
of
mankind
those
which
they
hold
in
the
most
unqualified
approbation
and
which
have
been
instilled
into
them
under
the
strongest
sanctions
are
of
this
latter
kind
that
is
opinions
not
which
they
have
ever
thought
known
or
felt
one
tittle
about
but
which
they
have
taken
up
on
trust
from
others
which
have
been
palmed
on
their
understandings
by
fraud
or
force
and
which
they
continue
to
hold
at
the
peril
of
life
limb
property
and
character
with
as
little
warrant
from
common
sense
in
the
first
instance
as
appeal
to
reason
in
the
last
the
ratio
proceeds
upon
a
very
different
plea
common
sense
is
neither
priestcraft
nor
yet
the
rub
that
makes
absurdity
of
so
long
life
and
at
the
same
time
gives
the
sceptical
philosophers
the
advantage
over
us
till
nature
has
fair
play
allowed
it
and
is
not
adulterated
by
political
and
polemical
quacks
as
it
so
often
has
been
it
is
impossible
to
appeal
to
it
as
a
defence
against
the
errors
and
extravagances
of
mere
reason
if
we
talk
of
common
sense
we
are
twitted
with
vulgar
prejudice
and
asked
how
we
distinguish
the
one
from
the
other
but
common
and
received
opinion
is
indeed
compost
heap
of
crude
notions
got
together
by
the
pride
and
passions
of
individuals
and
reason
is
itself
the
thrall
or
manumitted
slave
of
the
same
lordly
and
besotted
masters
dragging
its
servile
chain
or
committing
all
sorts
of
saturnalian
licenses
the
moment
it
feels
itself
freed
from
if
ten
millions
of
englishmen
are
furious
in
thinking
themselves
right
in
making
war
upon
thirty
millions
of
frenchmen
and
if
the
last
are
equally
bent
upon
thinking
the
others
always
in
the
wrong
though
it
is
a
common
and
national
prejudice
both
opinions
can
not
be
the
dictate
of
good
sense
but
it
may
be
the
infatuated
policy
of
one
or
both
governments
to
keep
their
subjects
always
at
variance
if
a
few
centuries
ago
all
europe
believed
in
the
infallibility
of
the
pope
this
was
not
an
opinion
derived
from
the
proper
exercise
or
erroneous
direction
of
the
common
sense
of
the
people
common
sense
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
they
believed
whatever
their
priests
told
them
england
at
present
is
divided
into
whigs
and
tories
churchmen
and
dissenters
both
parties
have
numbers
on
their
side
but
common
sense
and
party
spirit
are
two
different
things
sects
and
heresies
are
upheld
partly
by
sympathy
and
partly
by
the
love
of
contradiction
if
there
was
nobody
of
a
different
way
of
thinking
they
would
fall
to
pieces
of
themselves
if
a
whole
court
say
the
same
thing
this
is
no
proof
that
they
think
it
but
that
the
individual
at
the
head
of
the
court
has
said
it
if
a
mob
agree
for
a
while
in
shouting
the
same
watchword
this
is
not
to
me
an
example
of
the
they
only
repeat
what
they
have
heard
repeated
by
others
if
indeed
a
large
proportion
of
the
people
are
in
want
of
food
of
clothing
of
shelter
if
they
are
sick
miserable
scorned
oppressed
and
if
each
feeling
it
in
himself
they
all
say
so
with
one
voice
and
one
heart
and
lift
up
their
hands
to
second
their
appeal
this
i
should
say
was
but
the
dictate
of
common
sense
the
cry
of
nature
but
to
waive
this
part
of
the
argument
which
it
is
needless
to
push
farther
l
believe
that
the
best
way
to
instruct
mankind
is
not
by
pointing
out
to
them
their
mutual
errors
but
by
teaching
them
to
think
rightly
on
indifferent
matters
where
they
will
listen
with
patience
in
order
to
be
amused
and
where
they
do
not
consider
a
definition
or
a
syllogism
as
the
greatest
injury
you
can
offer
them
there
is
no
rule
for
expression
it
is
got
at
solely
by
that
is
on
the
principle
of
the
association
of
ideas
and
by
transferring
what
has
been
found
to
hold
good
in
one
case
with
the
necessary
modifications
to
others
a
certain
look
has
been
remarked
strongly
indicative
of
a
certain
passion
or
trait
of
character
and
we
attach
the
same
meaning
to
it
or
are
affected
in
the
same
pleasurable
or
painful
manner
by
it
where
it
exists
in
a
less
degree
though
we
can
define
neither
the
look
itself
nor
the
modification
of
it
having
got
the
general
clue
the
exact
result
may
be
left
to
the
imagination
to
vary
to
extenuate
or
aggravate
it
according
to
circumstances
in
the
admirable
profile
of
oliver
cromwell
after
the
drooping
eyelids
as
if
drawing
a
veil
over
the
fixed
penetrating
glance
the
nostrils
somewhat
distended
and
lips
compressed
so
as
hardly
to
let
the
breath
escape
him
denote
the
character
of
the
man
for
policy
and
deep
designs
as
plainly
as
they
can
be
written
how
is
it
that
we
decipher
this
expression
in
the
face
first
by
feeling
it
and
how
is
it
that
we
feel
it
not
by
rules
but
by
the
instinct
of
analogy
by
the
principle
of
association
which
is
subtle
and
sure
in
proportion
as
it
is
variable
and
indefinite
a
circumstance
apparently
of
no
value
shall
alter
the
whole
interpretation
to
be
put
upon
an
expression
or
action
and
it
shall
alter
it
thus
powerfully
because
in
proportion
to
its
very
insignificance
it
shows
a
strong
general
principle
at
work
that
extends
in
its
ramifications
to
the
smallest
things
this
in
fact
will
make
all
the
difference
between
minuteness
and
subtlety
or
refinement
for
a
small
or
trivial
effect
may
in
given
circumstances
imply
the
operation
of
a
great
power
stillness
may
be
the
result
of
a
blow
too
powerful
to
be
resisted
silence
may
be
imposed
by
feelings
too
agonising
for
utterance
the
minute
the
trifling
and
insipid
is
that
which
is
little
in
itself
in
its
causes
and
its
consequences
the
subtle
and
refined
is
that
which
is
slight
and
evanescent
at
first
sight
but
which
mounts
up
to
a
mighty
sum
in
the
end
which
is
an
essential
part
of
an
important
whole
which
has
consequences
greater
than
itself
and
where
more
is
meant
than
meets
the
eye
or
ear
we
complain
sometimes
of
littleness
in
a
dutch
picture
where
there
are
a
vast
number
of
distinct
parts
and
objects
each
small
in
itself
and
leading
to
nothing
else
a
sky
of
claude
can
not
fall
under
this
censure
where
one
imperceptible
gradation
is
as
it
were
the
scale
to
another
where
the
broad
arch
of
heaven
is
piled
up
of
endlessly
intermediate
gold
and
azure
tints
and
where
an
infinite
number
of
minute
scarce
noticed
particulars
blend
and
melt
into
universal
harmony
the
subtlety
in
shakespear
of
which
there
is
an
immense
deal
scattered
everywhere
up
and
down
is
always
the
instrument
of
passion
the
vehicle
of
character
the
action
of
a
man
pulling
his
hat
over
his
forehead
is
indifferent
enough
in
itself
and
generally
speaking
may
mean
anything
or
nothing
but
in
the
circumstances
in
which
macduff
is
placed
it
is
neither
insignificant
nor
equivocal
what
man
pull
your
hat
upon
your
brows
etc
it
admits
but
of
one
interpretation
or
inference
that
which
follows
it
give
sorrow
words
the
grief
that
does
not
speak
whispers
the
heart
and
bids
it
break
the
passage
in
the
same
play
in
which
duncan
and
his
attendants
are
introduced
commenting
on
the
beauty
and
situation
of
macbeth
castle
though
familiar
in
itself
has
been
often
praised
for
the
striking
contrast
it
presents
to
the
scenes
which
the
same
look
in
different
circumstances
may
convey
a
totally
different
expression
thus
the
eye
turned
round
to
look
at
you
without
turning
the
head
indicates
generally
slyness
or
suspicion
but
if
this
is
combined
with
large
expanded
eyelids
or
fixed
eyebrows
as
we
see
it
in
titian
pictures
it
will
denote
calm
contemplation
or
piercing
sagacity
without
anything
of
meanness
or
fear
of
being
observed
in
other
cases
it
may
imply
merely
indolent
enticing
voluptuousness
as
in
lely
portraits
of
women
the
languor
and
weakness
of
the
eyelids
give
the
amorous
turn
to
the
expression
how
should
there
be
a
rule
for
all
this
beforehand
seeing
it
depends
on
circumstances
ever
varying
and
scarce
discernible
but
by
their
effect
on
the
mind
rules
are
applicable
to
abstractions
but
expression
is
concrete
and
individual
we
know
the
meaning
of
certain
looks
and
we
feel
how
they
modify
one
another
in
conjunction
but
we
can
not
have
a
separate
rule
to
judge
of
all
their
combinations
in
different
degrees
and
circumstances
without
foreseeing
all
those
combinations
which
is
impossible
or
if
we
did
foresee
them
we
should
only
be
where
we
are
that
is
we
could
only
make
the
rule
as
we
now
judge
without
it
from
imagination
and
the
feeling
of
the
moment
the
absurdity
of
reducing
expression
to
a
preconcerted
system
was
perhaps
never
more
evidently
shown
than
in
a
picture
of
the
judgment
of
solomon
by
so
great
a
man
as
poussin
which
i
once
heard
admired
for
the
skill
and
discrimination
of
the
artist
in
making
all
the
women
who
are
ranged
on
one
side
in
the
greatest
alarm
at
the
sentence
of
the
judge
while
all
the
men
on
the
opposite
side
see
through
the
design
of
it
nature
does
not
go
to
work
or
cast
things
in
a
regular
mould
in
this
sort
of
way
i
once
heard
a
person
remark
of
another
has
an
eye
like
a
vicious
horse
this
was
a
fair
analogy
we
all
i
believe
have
noticed
the
look
of
a
horse
eye
just
before
he
is
going
to
bite
or
kick
but
will
any
one
therefore
describe
to
me
exactly
what
that
look
is
it
was
the
same
acute
observer
that
said
of
a
prating
talks
on
all
subjects
which
expressed
the
man
at
once
by
an
allusion
to
his
profession
the
coincidence
was
indeed
perfect
nothing
else
could
compare
with
the
easy
assurance
with
which
this
gentleman
would
volunteer
an
explanation
of
things
of
which
he
was
most
ignorant
but
the
with
which
a
musician
sits
down
to
a
harpsichord
to
play
a
piece
he
has
never
seen
before
my
physiognomical
friend
would
not
have
hit
on
this
mode
of
illustration
without
knowing
the
profession
of
the
subject
of
his
criticism
but
having
this
hint
given
him
it
instantly
suggested
itself
to
his
trailing
the
manner
of
the
speaker
was
evident
and
the
association
of
the
sitting
down
to
play
at
sight
lurking
in
his
mind
was
immediately
called
out
by
the
strength
of
his
impression
of
the
character
the
feeling
of
character
and
the
felicity
of
invention
in
explaining
it
were
nearly
allied
to
each
other
the
first
was
so
wrought
up
and
running
over
that
the
transition
to
the
last
was
very
easy
and
unavoidable
when
kean
was
so
much
praised
for
the
action
of
richard
in
his
last
struggle
with
his
triumphant
antagonist
where
he
stands
after
his
sword
is
wrested
from
him
with
his
hands
stretched
out
if
his
will
could
not
be
disarmed
and
the
very
phantoms
of
his
despair
had
a
withering
power
he
said
that
he
borrowed
it
from
seeing
the
last
efforts
of
painter
in
his
fight
with
oliver
this
assuredly
did
not
lessen
the
merit
of
it
thus
it
ever
is
with
the
man
of
real
genius
he
has
the
feeling
of
truth
already
shrined
in
his
own
breast
and
his
eye
is
still
bent
on
nature
to
see
how
she
expresses
herself
when
we
thoroughly
understand
the
subject
it
is
easy
to
translate
from
one
language
into
another
raphael
in
muffling
up
the
figure
of
elymas
the
sorcerer
in
his
garments
appears
to
have
extended
the
idea
of
blindness
even
to
his
clothes
was
this
design
probably
not
but
merely
the
feeling
of
analogy
thoughtlessly
suggesting
this
device
which
being
so
suggested
was
retained
and
carried
on
because
it
flattered
or
fell
in
with
the
original
feeling
the
tide
of
passion
when
strong
overflows
and
gradually
insinuates
itself
into
all
nooks
and
corners
of
the
mind
invention
of
the
best
kind
i
therefore
do
not
think
so
distinct
a
thing
from
feeling
as
some
are
apt
to
imagine
the
springs
of
pure
feeling
will
rise
and
fill
the
moulds
of
fancy
that
are
fit
to
receive
it
there
are
some
striking
coincidences
of
colour
in
pictures
as
in
a
straggling
weed
in
the
foreground
streaked
with
blue
or
red
to
answer
to
a
blue
or
red
drapery
to
the
tone
of
the
flesh
or
an
opening
in
the
sky
not
that
this
was
intended
or
done
by
the
rule
for
then
it
would
presently
become
affected
and
ridiculous
but
the
eye
being
imbued
with
a
certain
colour
repeats
and
varies
it
from
a
natural
sense
of
harmony
a
secret
craving
and
appetite
for
beauty
which
in
the
same
manner
soothes
and
gratifies
the
eye
of
taste
though
the
cause
is
not
understood
is
nothing
but
the
being
completely
aware
of
the
feeling
belonging
to
certain
situations
passions
and
the
being
consequently
sensible
to
their
slightest
indications
or
movements
in
others
one
of
the
most
remarkable
instances
of
this
sort
of
faculty
is
the
following
story
told
of
lord
shaftesbury
the
grandfather
of
the
author
of
the
he
had
been
to
dine
with
lady
clarendon
and
her
daughter
who
was
at
that
time
privately
married
to
the
duke
of
york
afterwards
james
ii
and
as
he
returned
home
with
another
nobleman
who
had
accompanied
him
he
suddenly
turned
to
him
and
said
upon
it
the
duke
has
married
hyde
daughter
his
companion
could
not
comprehend
what
he
meant
but
on
explaining
himself
he
said
mother
behaved
to
her
with
an
attention
and
a
marked
respect
that
it
is
impossible
to
account
for
in
any
other
way
and
i
am
sure
of
it
his
conjecture
shortly
afterwards
proved
to
be
the
truth
this
was
carrying
the
prophetic
spirit
of
common
sense
as
far
as
it
could
go

not
merely
recall

them
the
idea

it
a

nameless

hope
romantic

national
pride

which
rush
in
with

currents

swell

continued
genius
or
originality
is
for
the
most
part
strong
quality
in
the
mind
answering
to
and
bringing
out
some
new
and
striking
quality
in
imagination
is
more
properly
the
power
of
carrying
on
a
given
feeling
into
other
situations
which
must
be
done
best
according
to
the
hold
which
the
feeling
itself
has
taken
of
the
mind
in
new
and
unknown
combinations
the
impression
must
act
by
sympathy
and
not
by
rule
but
there
can
be
no
sympathy
where
there
is
no
passion
no
original
interest
the
personal
interest
may
in
some
cases
oppress
and
circumscribe
the
imaginative
faculty
as
in
the
instance
of
rousseau
but
in
general
the
strength
and
consistency
of
the
imagination
will
be
in
proportion
to
the
strength
and
depth
of
feeling
and
it
is
rarely
that
a
man
even
of
lofty
genius
will
be
able
to
do
more
than
carry
on
his
own
feelings
and
character
or
some
prominent
and
ruling
passion
into
fictitious
and
uncommon
situations
milton
has
by
allusion
embodied
a
great
part
of
his
political
and
personal
history
in
the
chief
characters
and
incidents
of
he
has
no
doubt
wonderfully
adapted
and
heightened
them
but
the
elements
are
the
same
you
trace
the
bias
and
opinions
of
the
man
in
the
creations
of
the
poet
above
the
definition
of
genius
above
the
definition
of
genius
shakespear
almost
alone
seems
to
have
a
man
of
genius
raised
above
the
definition
of
genious
universal
heir
to
all
humanity
he
was
one
in
suffering
all
who
suffered
nothing
with
a
perfect
sympathy
with
all
things
yet
alike
indifferent
to
all
who
did
not
tamper
with
nature
or
warp
her
to
his
own
purposes
who
all
qualities
with
a
learned
spirit
instead
of
judging
of
them
by
his
own
predilections
and
was
rather
pipe
for
the
muse
finger
to
play
what
stop
she
pleasd
than
anxious
to
set
up

character
or
pretensions
of
his
own
his
genius
consisted
in
the
faculty
of
transforming
himself
at
will
into
whatever
he
chose
his
originality
was
the
power
of
seeing
every
object
from
the
exact
point
of
view
in
which
others
would
see
it
he
was
the
proteus
of
human
intellect
genius
in
ordinary
is
a
more
obstinate
and
less
versatile
thing
it
is
sufficiently
exclusive
and
quaint
and
peculiar
it
does
some
one
thing
by
virtue
of
doing
nothing
else
it
excels
in
some
one
pursuit
by
being
blind
to
all
excellence
but
its
own
it
is
just
the
reverse
of
the
cameleon
for
it
does
not
borrow
but
lends
its
colour
to
all
about
it
or
like
the
discloses
a
little
circle
of
gorgeous
light
in
the
twilight
of
obscurity
in
the
night
of
intellect
that
surrounds
it
so
did
rembrandt
if
ever
there
was
a
man
of
genius
he
was
one
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
term
he
lived
in
and
revealed
to
otters
a
world
of
his
own
and
might
be
said
to
have
invented
a
new
view
of
nature
he
did
not
discover
things
nature
in
fiction
or
fairy
land
or
make
a
voyage
to
the
moon
descry
new
lands
rivers
or
mountains
in
her
spotty
globe
but
saw
things
nature
that
every
one
had
missed
before
him
and
gave
others
eyes
to
see
them
with
this
is
the
test
and
triumph
of
originality
not
to
show
us
what
has
never
been
and
what
we
may
therefore
very
easily
never
have
dreamt
of
but
to
point
out
to
us
what
is
before
our
eyes
and
under
our
feet
though
we
have
had
no
suspicion
of
its
existence
for
want
of
sufficient
strength
of
intuition
of
determined
grasp
of
mind
to
seize
and
retain
it
rembrandt
conquests
were
not
over
the
but
the
real
he
did
not
contrive
a
new
story
or
character
but
we
nearly
owe
to
him
a
fifth
part
of
painting
the
knowledge
of
a
distinct
power
and
element
in
art
and
nature
he
had
a
steadiness
a
firm
keeping
of
mind
and
eye
that
first
stood
the
shock
of
extremes
in
light
and
shade
or
reconciled
the
greatest
obscurity
and
the
greatest
brilliancy
into
perfect
harmony
and
he
therefore
was
the
first
to
hazard
this
appearance
upon
canvas
and
give
full
effect
to
what
he
saw
and
delighted
in
he
was
led
to
adopt
this
style
of
broad
and
startling
contrast
from
its
congeniality
to
his
own
feelings
his
mind
grappled
with
that
which
afforded
the
best
exercise
to
its
he
was
bold
in
act
because
he
was
urged
on
by
a
strong
native
impulse
originality
is
then
nothing
but
nature
and
feeling
working
in
the
mind
a
man
does
not
affect
to
be
original
he
is
so
because
he
can
not
help
it
and
often
without
knowing
it
this
extraordinary
artist
indeed
might
be
said
to
have
had
a
particular
organ
for
colour
his
eye
seemed
to
come
in
contact
with
it
as
a
feeling
to
lay
hold
of
it
as
a
substance
rather
than
to
contemplate
it
as
a
visual
object
the
texture
of
his
landscapes
is
the
earth
earthy
his
clouds
are
humid
heavy
slow
his
shadows
are
that
may
be
felt
a
obscure
his
lights
are
lumps
of
liquid
splendour
there
is
something
more
in
this
than
can
be
accounted
for
from
design
or
accident
rembrandt
was
not
a
man
made
up
of
two
or
three
rules
and
directions
for
acquiring
genius
i
am
afraid
i
shall
hardly
write
so
satisfactory
a
character
of
wordsworth
though
he
too
like
rembrandt
has
a
faculty
of
making
something
out
of
nothing
that
is
out
of
himself
by
the
medium
through
which
he
sees
and
with
which
he
clothes
the
barrenest
subject
wordsworth
is
the
last
man
to
abroad
into
universality
if
that
alone
constituted
genius
he
looks
at
home
into
himself
and
is
with
riches
fineless
he
would
in
the
other
case
be
as
winter
if
he
had
nothing
but
general
capacity
to
trust
to
he
is
the
greatest
that
is
the
most
original
poet
of
the
present
day
only
because
he
is
the
greatest
egotist
he
is
not
dark
he
sits
in
the
centre
of
his
own
being
and
there
bright
day
he
does
not
waste
a
thought
on
others
whatever
does
not
relate
exclusively
and
wholly
to
himself
is
foreign
to
his
views
he
contemplates
a
figure
of
himself
he
looks
along
the
unbroken
line
of
his
personal
identity
he
thrusts
aside
all
other
objects
all
other
interests
with
scorn
and
impatience
that
he
may
repose
on
his
own
being
that
he
may
dig
out
the
treasures
of
thought
contained
in
it
that
he
may
unfold
the
precious
stores
of
a
mind
for
ever
brooding
over
itself
his
genius
is
the
effect
of
his
individual
character
he
stamps
that
character
that
deep
individual
interest
on
whatever
he
meets
the
object
is
nothing
but
as
it
furnishes
food
for
internal
meditation
for
old
associations
if
there
had
been
no
other
being
in
the
universe
wordsworth
poetry
would
have
been
just
what
it
is
if
there
had
been
neither
love
nor
friendship
neither
ambition
nor
pleasure
nor
business
in
the
world
the
author
of
the
need
not
have
been
greatly
changed
from
what
he
is
might
still
have
the
noiseless
tenour
of
his
way
retired
in
the
sanctuary
of
his
own
heart
hallowing
the
sabbath
of
his
own
thoughts
with
the
passions
the
pursuits
and
imaginations
of
other
men
he
does
not
profess
to
sympathise
but
tongues
in
the
trees
books
in
the
running
brooks
sermons
in
stones
and
good
in
everything
with
a
mind
averse
from
outward
objects
but
ever
intent
upon
its
own
workings
he
hangs
a
weight
of
thought
and
feeling
upon
every
trifling
circumstance
connected
with
his
past
history
the
note
of
the
cuckoo
sounds
in
his
ear
like
the
voice
of
other
years
the
daisy
spreads
its
leaves
in
the
rays
of
boyish
delight
that
stream
from
his
thoughtful
eyes
the
rainbow
lifts
its
proud
arch
in
heaven
but
to
mark
his
progress
from
infancy
to
manhood
an
old
thorn
is
buried
bowed
down
under
the
mass
of
associations
he
has
wound
about
it
and
to
him
as
he
himself
beautifully
says
the
meanest
that
blows
can
give
thoughts
that
do
often
lie
too
deep
for
tears
it
is
this
power
of
habitual
sentiment
or
of
transferring
the
interest
of
our
conscious
existence
to
whatever
gently
solicits
attention
and
is
a
link
in
the
chain
of
association
without
rousing
our
passions
or
hurting
our
pride
that
is
the
striking
feature
in
wordsworth
mind
and
poetry
others
have
left
and
shown
this
power
before
as
wither
burns
but
none
have
felt
it
so
intensely
and
absolutely
as
to
lend
to
it
the
voice
of
inspiration
as
to
make
it
the
foundation
of
a
new
style
and
school
in
poetry
his
strength
as
it
so
often
happens
arises
from
the
excess
of
his
weakness
but
he
has
opened
a
new
avenue
to
the
human
heart
has
explored
another
secret
haunt
and
nook
of
nature
to
verse
and
sure
of
everlasting
fame
compared
with
his
lines
lord
byron
stanzas
are
but
exaggerated
and
walter
scott
poetry
not
his
prose
old
wives
fables
there
is
no
one
in
whom
i
have
been
more
disappointed
than
in
the
writer
here
spoken
of
nor
with
whom
i
am
more
disposed
on
certain
points
to
quarrel
but
the
love
of
truth
and
justice
which
obliges
me
to
do
this
will
not
suffer
me
to
blench
his
merits
do
what
he
can
he
can
not
help
being
an
man
his
poetry
is
not
servile
while
the
cuckoo
returns
in
the
spring
while
the
daisy
looks
bright
in
the
sun
while
the
rainbow
lifts
its
head
above
the
storm
yet
i
remember
thee
glencairn
and
all
that
thou
hast
done
for
me
sir
joshua
reynolds
in
endeavouring
to
show
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
proper
originality
a
spirit
emanating
from
the
mind
of
the
artist
and
shining
through
his
works
has
traced
raphael
through
a
number
of
figures
which
he
has
borrowed
from
masaccio
and
others
this
is
a
bad
calculation
if
raphael
had
only
borrowed
those
figures
from
others
would
he
even
in
sir
joshua
sense
have
been
entitled
to
the
praise
of
originality
plagiarism
in
so
far
as
it
is
plagiarism
is
not
originality
salvator
is
considered
by
many
as
a
great
genius
he
is
what
they
call
an
irregular
genius
my
notion
of
genius
is
not
exactly
the
same
as
theirs
it
has
also
been
made
a
question
whether
there
is
not
more
genius
in
rembrandt
three
trees
than
in
all
claude
landscapes
i
do
not
know
how
that
may
be
but
it
was
enough
for
claude
to
have
been
a
perfect
capacity
is
not
the
same
thing
as
genius
capacity
may
be
described
to
relate
to
the
quantity
of
knowledge
however
acquired
genius
to
its
quality
and
the
mode
of
acquiring
it
capacity
is
power
over
given
ideas
combinations
of
ideas
genius
is
the
power
over
those
which
are
not
given
and
for
which
no
obvious
or
precise
rule
can
be
laid
down
or
capacity
is
power
of
any
sort
genius
is
power
of
a
different
sort
from
what
has
yet
been
shown
a
retentive
memory
a
clear
understanding
is
capacity
but
it
is
not
genius
the
admirable
crichton
was
a
person
of
prodigious
capacity
but
there
is
no
proof
that
i
know
that
he
had
an
atom
of
genius
his
verses
that
remain
are
dull
and
sterile
he
could
learn
all
that
was
known
of
any
subject
he
could
do
anything
if
others
could
show
him
the
way
to
do
it
this
was
very
wonderful
but
that
is
all
you
can
say
of
it
it
requires
a
good
capacity
to
play
well
at
chess
but
after
all
it
is
a
game
of
skill
and
not
of
genius
know
what
you
will
of
it
the
understanding
still
moves
in
certain
tracks
in
which
others
have
trod
it
before
quicker
or
slower
with
more
or
less
comprehension
and
presence
of
mind
the
greatest
skill
strikes
out
nothing
for
itself
from
its
own
peculiar
resources
the
nature
of
the
game
is
a
thing
determinate
and
fixed
there
is
no
royal
or
poetical
road
to
checkmate
your
adversary
there
is
no
place
for
genius
but
in
the
indefinite
and
unknown
the
discovery
of
the
binomial
theorem
was
an
effort
of
genius
but
there
was
none
shown
in
jedediah
buxton
being
able
to
multiply
figures
by
in
his
head
if
he
could
have
multiplied
figures
by
instead
of
it
would
have
been
equally
useless
toil
and
trouble
he
is
a
man
of
capacity
who
possesses
considerable
intellectual
riches
he
is
a
man
of
genius
who
finds
out
a
vein
of
new
ore
originality
is
the
seeing
nature
differently
from
others
and
yet
as
it
is
in
itself
it
is
not
singularity
or
affectation
but
the
discovery
of
new
and
valuable
truth
all
the
world
do
not
see
the
whole
meaning
of
any
object
they
have
been
looking
at
habit
blinds
them
to
some
things
to
others
every
mind
is
not
a
gauge
and
measure
of
truth
nature
has
her
surface
and
her
dark
recesses
she
is
deep
obscure
and
infinite
it
is
only
minds
on
whom
she
makes
her
fullest
impressions
that
can
penetrate
her
shrine
or
unveil
her
of
it
is
only
those
whom
she
has
filled
with
her
spirit
that
have
the
boldness
or
the
power
to
reveal
her
mysteries
to
others
but
nature
has
a
thousand
aspects
and
one
man
can
only
draw
out
one
of
them
whoever
does
this
is
a
man
of
genius
one
displays
her
force
another
her
refinement
one
her
power
of
harmony
another
her
suddenness
of
contrast
one
her
beauty
of
form
another
her
splendour
of
colour
each
does
that
for
which
he
is
best
fitted
by
his
particular
genius
that
is
to
say
by
some
quality
of
mind
into
which
the
quality
of
the
object
sinks
deepest
where
it
finds
the
most
cordial
welcome
is
perceived
to
its
utmost
extent
and
where
again
it
forces
its
way
out
from
the
fulness
with
which
it
has
taken
possession
of
the
mind
of
the
student
the
imagination
gives
out
what
it
has
first
absorbed
by
congeniality
of
temperament
what
it
has
attracted
and
moulded
into
itself
by
elective
affinity
as
the
loadstone
draws
and
impregnates
iron
a
little
originality
is
more
esteemed
and
sought
for
than
the
greatest
acquired
talent
because
it
throws
a
new
light
upon
things
and
is
peculiar
to
the
individual
the
other
is
common
and
may
be
had
for
the
asking
to
any
amount
the
value
of
any
work
is
to
be
judged
of
by
the
quantity
of
originality
contained
in
it
a
very
little
of
this
will
go
a
great
way
if
goldsmith
had
never
written
anything
but
the
two
or
three
first
chapters
of
the
of
or
the
character
of
a
village
schoolmaster
they
would
have
stamped
him
a
man
of
genius
the
editors
of
encyclopedias
are
not
usually
reckoned
the
first
literary
characters
of
the
age
the
works
of
which
they
have
the
management
contain
a
great
deal
of
knowledge
like
chests
or
warehouses
but
the
goods
are
not
their
own
we
should
as
soon
think
of
admiring
the
shelves
of
a
library
but
the
shelves
of
a
library
are
useful
and
respectable
i
was
once
applied
to
in
a
delicate
emergency
to
write
an
article
on
a
difficult
subject
for
an
encyclopedia
and
was
advised
to
take
time
and
give
it
a
systematic
and
scientific
form
to
avail
myself
of
all
the
knowledge
that
was
to
be
obtained
on
the
subject
and
arrange
it
with
clearness
and
method
i
made
answer
that
as
to
the
first
i
had
taken
time
to
do
all
that
i
ever
pretended
to
do
as
i
had
thought
incessantly
on
different
matters
for
twenty
years
of
my
life
that
i
had
no
particular
knowledge
of
the
subject
in
question
and
no
head
for
arrangement
and
that
the
utmost
i
could
do
in
such
a
case
would
be
when
a
systematic
and
scientific
article
was
prepared
to
write
marginal
notes
upon
it
to
insert
a
remark
or
illustration
of
my
own
not
to
be
found
in
former
encyclopedias
or
to
suggest
a
better
definition
than
had
been
offered
in
the
text
there
are
two
sorts
of
writing
the
first
is
compilation
and
consists
in
collecting
and
stating
all
that
is
already
known
of
any
question
in
the
best
possible
manner
for
the
benefit
of
the
uninformed
reader
an
author
of
this
class
is
a
very
learned
amanuensis
of
other
people
thoughts
the
second
sort
proceeds
on
an
entirely
different
principle
instead
of
bringing
down
the
account
of
knowledge
to
the
point
at
which
it
has
already
arrived
it
professes
to
start
from
that
point
on
the
strength
of
the
writer
individual
reflections
and
supposing
the
reader
in
possession
of
what
is
already
known
supplies
deficiencies
fills
up
certain
blanks
and
quits
the
beaten
road
in
search
of
new
tracts
of
observation
or
sources
of
feeling
it
is
in
vain
to
object
to
this
last
style
that
it
is
disjointed
disproportioned
and
irregular
it
is
merely
a
set
of
additions
and
corrections
to
other
men
works
or
to
the
common
stock
of
human
knowledge
printed
separately
you
might
as
well
expect
a
continued
chain
of
reasoning
in
the
notes
to
a
book
it
skips
all
the
trite
intermediate
level
of
the
subject
and
only
stops
at
the
difficult
passages
of
the
human
mind
or
touches
on
some
striking
point
that
has
been
overlooked
in
previous
editions
a
view
of
a
subject
to
be
connected
and
regular
can
not
be
all
new
a
writer
will
always
be
liable
to
be
charged
either
with
paradox
or
either
with
dulness
or
affectation
but
we
have
no
right
to
demand
from
any
one
more
than
he
pretends
to
there
is
indeed
a
medium
in
all
things
but
to
unite
opposite
excellencies
is
a
task
ordinarily
too
hard
for
mortality
he
who
succeeds
in
what
he
aims
at
or
who
takes
the
lead
in
any
one
mode
or
path
of
excellence
may
think
himself
very
well
off
it
would
not
be
fair
to
complain
of
the
style
of
an
encyclopedia
as
dull
as
wanting
volatile
salt
nor
of
the
style
of
an
essay
because
it
is
too
light
and
sparkling
because
it
is
not
a
so
it
is
rather
an
odd
objection
to
a
work
that
it
is
made
up
entirely
of
passages
at
least
it
is
a
fault
that
can
be
found
with
few
works
and
the
book
might
be
pardoned
for
its
singularity
the
censure
might
indeed
seem
like
adroit
flattery
if
it
were
not
passed
on
an
author
whom
any
objection
is
sufficient
to
render
unpopular
and
ridiculous
i
grant
it
is
best
to
unite
solidity
with
show
general
information
with
particular
ingenuity
this
is
the
pattern
of
a
perfect
style
but
i
myself
do
not
pretend
to
be
a
perfect
writer
in
fine
we
do
not
banish
light
french
wines
from
our
tables
or
refuse
to
taste
sparkling
champagne
when
we
can
get
it
because
it
has
not
the
body
of
old
port
besides
i
do
not
know
that
dulness
is
strength
or
that
an
observation
is
slight
because
it
is
striking
mediocrity
insipidity
want
of
character
is
the
great
fault
mediocribus
esse
poetis
non
dii
non
homines
non
concessere
columnae
neither
is
this
privilege
allowed
to
in
our
time
any
more
than
to
poets
formerly
it
is
not
then
acuteness
of
organs
or
extent
of
capacity
that
constitutes
rare
genius
or
produces
the
most
exquisite
models
of
art
but
an
intense
sympathy
with
some
one
beauty
or
distinguishing
characteristic
in
nature
irritability
alone
or
the
interest
taken
in
certain
things
may
supply
the
place
of
genius
in
weak
and
otherwise
ordinary
minds
as
there
are
certain
instruments
fitted
to
perform
certain
kinds
of
labour
there
are
certain
minds
so
framed
as
to
produce
certain
in
art
and
literature
which
is
surely
the
best
use
they
can
be
put
to
if
a
man
had
all
sorts
of
instruments
in
his
shop
and
wanted
one
he
would
rather
have
that
one
than
be
supplied
with
a
double
set
of
all
the
others
if
he
had
them
twice
over
he
could
only
do
what
he
can
do
as
it
is
whereas
without
that
one
he
perhaps
can
not
finish
any
one
work
he
has
in
hand
so
if
a
man
can
do
one
thing
better
than
anybody
else
the
value
of
this
one
thing
is
what
he
must
stand
or
fall
by
and
his
being
able
to
do
a
hundred
other
things
merely
as
anybody
else
would
not
alter
the
sentence
or
add
to
his
respectability
on
the
contrary
his
being
able
to
do
so
many
other
things
well
would
probably
interfere
with
and
encumber
him
in
the
execution
of
the
only
thing
that
others
can
not
do
as
well
as
he
and
so
far
be
a
drawback
and
a
disadvantage
more
people
in
fact
fail
from
a
multiplicity
of
talents
and
pretensions
than
from
an
absolute
poverty
of
resources
i
have
given
instances
of
this
elsewhere
perhaps
shakespear
tragedies
would
in
some
respects
have
been
better
if
he
had
never
written
comedies
at
all
and
in
that
case
his
comedies
might
well
have
been
spared
though
they
must
have
cost
us
some
regret
racine
it
is
said
might
have
rivalled
moliere
in
comedy
but
he
gave
up
the
cultivation
of
his
comic
talents
to
devote
himself
wholly
to
the
tragic
muse
if
as
the
french
tell
us
he
in
consequence
attained
to
the
perfection
of
tragic
composition
this
was
better
than
writing
comedies
as
well
as
moliere
and
tragedies
as
well
as
crebillon
yet
i
count
those
persons
fools
who
think
it
a
pity
hogarth
did
not
succeed
better
in
serious
subjects
the
division
of
labour
is
an
excellent
principle
in
taste
as
well
as
in
mechanics
without
this
i
find
from
adam
smith
we
could
not
have
a
pin
made
to
the
degree
of
perfection
it
is
we
do
not
on
any
rational
scheme
of
criticism
inquire
into
the
variety
of
a
excellences
or
the
number
of
his
works
or
his
facility
of
production
is
sufficient
for
otway
fame
i
hate
all
those
nonsensical
stories
about
lope
de
vega
and
his
writing
a
play
in
a
morning
before
breakfast
he
had
time
enough
to
do
it
after
if
a
man
leaves
behind
him
any
work
which
is
a
model
in
its
kind
we
have
no
right
to
ask
whether
he
could
do
anything
else
or
how
he
did
it
or
how
long
he
was
about
it
all
that
talent
which
is
not
necessary
to
the
actual
quantity
of
excellence
existing
in
the
world
loses
its
object
is
so
much
waste
talent
or
to
i
heard
a
sensible
man
say
he
should
like
to
do
some
one
thing
better
than
all
the
rest
of
the
world
and
in
everything
else
to
be
like
all
the
rest
of
the
world
why
should
a
man
do
more
than
his
part
the
rest
is
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
we
look
with
jealous
and
grudging
eyes
at
all
those
qualifications
which
are
not
essential
first
because
they
are
superfluous
and
next
because
we
suspect
they
will
be
prejudicial
why
does
kean
play
all
those
harlequin
tricks
of
singing
dancing
fencing
they
say
is
for
his
benefit
it
is
not
for
his
reputation
garrick
indeed
shone
equally
in
comedy
and
tragedy
but
he
was
first
not
in
both
there
is
not
a
greater
impertinence
than
to
ask
if
a
man
is
clever
out
of
his
profession
i
have
heard
of
people
trying
to
siddons
i
would
as
soon
try
to
entrap
one
of
the
elgin
marbles
into
an
argument
good
nature
and
common
sense
are
required
from
all
people
but
one
proud
distinction
is
enough
for
any
one
individual
to
possess
or
to
aspire
to
notes
to
essay
v
i
do
not
here
speak
of
the
figurative
or
fanciful
exercise
of
the
imagination
which
consists
in
finding
out
some
striking
object
or
image
to
illustrate
another
wordsworth
himself
should
not
say
this
and
yet
i
am
not
sure
he
would
not
the
only
good
thing
i
have
ever
heard
come
of
this
man
singular
faculty
of
memory
was
the
following
a
gentleman
was
mentioning
his
having
been
sent
up
to
london
from
the
place
where
he
lived
to
see
garrick
act
when
he
went
back
into
the
country
he
was
asked
what
he
thought
of
the
player
and
the
play
he
said
did
not
know
he
had
only
seen
a
little
man
strut
about
the
stage
and
repeat
words
one
hand
to
his
forehead
and
seeming
mightily
delighted
called
out
indeed
and
pray
was
he
found
to
be
correct
this
was
the
supererogation
of
literal
curiosity
jedediah
counting
the
number
of
words
was
idle
enough
but
here
was
a
fellow
who
wanted
some
one
to
count
them
over
again
to
see
if
he
was
correct
the
force
of
could
no
farther
go
sir
joshua
reynolds
being
asked
how
long
it
had
taken
him
to
do
a
certain
picture
made
answer
my
life
essay
vi
character
of
cobbett
people
have
about
as
substantial
an
idea
of
cobbett
as
they
have
of
cribb
his
blows
are
as
hard
and
he
himself
is
as
impenetrable
one
has
no
notion
of
him
as
making
use
of
a
fine
pen
but
a
great
his
style
stuns
his
readers
and
he
the
ear
of
the
public
with
a
beetle
he
is
too
much
for
any
single
newspaper
antagonist
waste
a
city
orator
or
member
of
parliament
and
bears
hard
upon
the
government
itself
he
is
a
kind
of
in
the
politics
of
the
country
he
is
not
only
unquestionably
the
most
powerful
political
writer
of
the
present
day
but
one
of
the
best
writers
in
the
language
he
speaks
and
thinks
plain
broad
downright
english
he
might
be
said
to
have
the
clearness
of
swift
the
naturalness
of
defoe
and
the
picturesque
satirical
description
of
mandeville
if
all
such
comparisons
were
not
impertinent
a
really
great
and
original
write
sense
sterne
was
not
a
wit
nor
shakespear
a
poet
it
is
easy
to
describe
talents
because
they
fall
into
a
class
and
enlist
under
a
standard
but
powers
defy
calculation
or
comparison
and
can
be
defined
only
by
themselves
they
are
and
make
the
class
to
which
they
belong
i
have
tried
half
a
dozen
times
to
describe
burke
style
without
ever
succeeding
its
severe
extravagance
its
literal
boldness
its
hyperboles
its
running
away
with
a
subject
and
from
it
at
the
same
time
but
there
is
no
making
it
out
for
there
is
no
example
of
the
same
thing
anywhere
else
we
have
no
common
measure
to
refer
to
and
his
qualities
contradict
even
themselves
cobbett
is
not
so
difficult
he
has
been
compared
to
paine
and
so
far
it
is
true
there
are
no
two
writers
who
come
more
into
juxtaposition
from
the
nature
of
their
subjects
from
the
internal
resources
on
which
they
draw
and
from
the
popular
effect
of
their
writings
and
their
adaptation
though
that
is
a
bad
word
in
the
present
case
to
the
capacity
of
every
reader
but
still
if
we
turn
to
a
volume
of
his
or
of
we
are
struck
not
to
say
somewhat
refreshed
by
the
difference
paine
is
a
much
more
sententious
writer
than
cobbett
you
can
not
open
a
page
in
any
of
his
best
and
earlier
works
without
meeting
with
some
maxim
some
antithetical
and
memorable
saying
which
is
a
sort
of
for
the
argument
and
the
goal
to
which
it
returns
there
is
not
a
single
a
single
sentence
in
cobbett
that
has
ever
been
quoted
again
if
anything
is
ever
quoted
from
him
it
is
an
epithet
of
abuse
or
a
nickname
he
is
an
excellent
hand
at
invention
in
that
way
and
has
in
him
what
could
be
better
than
his
pestering
erskine
year
after
year
with
his
second
title
of
baron
clackmannan
he
is
rather
too
fond
of
sons
and
daughters
of
paine
affected
to
reduce
things
to
first
principles
to
announce
truths
cobbett
troubles
himself
about
little
but
the
details
and
local
circumstances
the
first
appeared
to
have
made
up
his
mind
beforehand
to
certain
opinions
and
to
try
to
find
the
most
compendious
and
pointed
expressions
for
them
his
successor
appears
to
have
no
clue
no
fixed
or
leading
principles
nor
ever
to
have
thought
on
a
question
till
he
sits
down
to
write
about
it
but
then
there
seems
no
end
of
his
matters
of
fact
and
raw
materials
which
are
brought
out
in
all
their
strength
and
sharpness
from
not
having
been
squared
or
frittered
down
or
vamped
up
to
suit
a
theory
he
goes
on
with
his
descriptions
and
illustrations
as
if
he
would
never
come
to
a
stop
they
have
all
the
force
of
novelty
with
all
the
familiarity
of
old
acquaintance
his
knowledge
grows
out
of
the
subject
and
his
style
is
that
of
a
man
who
has
an
absolute
intuition
of
what
he
is
talking
about
and
never
thinks
of
anything
else
he
deals
in
premises
and
speaks
to
evidence
the
coming
to
a
conclusion
and
summing
up
which
was
paine
lies
in
a
smaller
compass
the
one
could
not
compose
an
elementary
treatise
on
politics
to
become
a
manual
for
the
popular
reader
nor
could
the
other
in
all
probability
have
kept
up
a
weekly
journal
for
the
same
number
of
years
with
the
same
spirit
interest
and
untired
perseverance
paine
writings
are
a
sort
of
introduction
to
political
arithmetic
on
a
new
plan
cobbett
keeps
a
and
makes
an
entry
at
full
of
all
the
occurrences
and
troublesome
questions
that
start
up
throughout
the
year
cobbett
with
vast
industry
vast
information
and
the
utmost
power
of
making
what
he
says
intelligible
never
seems
to
get
at
the
beginning
or
come
to
the
end
of
any
question
paine
in
a
few
short
sentences
seems
by
his
peremptory
manner
clear
it
from
all
controversy
past
present
and
to
come
paine
takes
a
view
of
things
cobbett
sticks
close
to
them
inspects
the
component
parts
and
keeps
fast
hold
of
the
smallest
advantages
they
afford
him
or
if
i
might
here
be
indulged
in
a
pastoral
allusion
paine
tries
to
enclose
his
ideas
in
a
fold
for
security
and
repose
cobbett
lets
pour
out
upon
the
plain
like
a
flock
of
sheep
to
feed
and
batten
cobbett
is
a
pleasanter
writer
for
those
to
read
who
do
not
agree
with
him
for
he
is
less
dogmatical
goes
more
into
the
common
grounds
of
fact
and
argument
to
which
all
appeal
is
more
desultory
and
various
and
appears
less
to
be
driving
at
a
present
conclusion
than
urged
on
by
the
force
of
present
conviction
he
is
therefore
tolerated
by
all
parties
though
he
has
made
himself
by
turns
obnoxious
to
all
and
even
those
he
abuses
read
him
the
reformers
read
him
when
he
was
a
tory
and
the
tories
read
him
now
that
he
is
a
reformer
he
must
i
think
however
be
to
the
whigs
if
he
is
less
metaphysical
and
poetical
than
his
celebrated
prototype
he
is
more
picturesque
and
dramatic
his
episodes
which
are
numerous
as
they
are
pertinent
are
striking
interesting
full
of
life
and
minute
double
measure
running
over
but
never
tedious
sufflaminandus
he
is
one
of
those
writers
who
can
never
tire
us
not
even
of
himself
and
the
reason
is
he
is
always
of
matter
he
never
runs
to
lees
never
gives
us
the
vapid
leavings
of
himself
is
never
stale
and
unprofitable
but
always
setting
out
afresh
on
his
journey
clearing
away
some
old
nuisance
and
turning
up
new
mould
his
egotism
is
delightful
for
there
is
no
affectation
in
it
he
does
not
talk
of
himself
for
lack
of
something
to
write
about
but
because
some
circumstance
that
has
happened
to
himself
is
the
best
possible
illustration
of
the
subject
and
he
is
not
the
man
to
shrink
from
giving
the
best
possible
illustration
of
the
subject
from
a
squeamish
delicacy
he
likes
both
himself
and
his
subject
too
well
he
does
not
put
himself
before
it
and
say
me
first
but
places
us
in
the
same
situation
with
himself
and
makes
us
see
all
that
he
does
there
is
no
no
conscious
hints
no
awkward
ventriloquism
no
testimonies
of
applause
no
abstract
senseless
no
smuggled
admiration
of
his
own
person
by
proxy
it
is
all
plain
and
he
writes
himself
plain
william
cobbett
strips
himself
quite
as
naked
as
anybody
would
wish
in
a
word
his
egotism
is
full
of
individuality
and
has
room
for
very
little
vanity
in
it
we
feel
delighted
rub
our
hands
and
draw
our
chair
to
the
fire
when
we
come
to
a
passage
of
this
sort
we
know
it
will
be
something
new
and
good
manly
and
simple
not
the
same
insipid
story
of
self
over
again
we
sit
down
at
table
with
the
writer
but
it
is
to
a
course
of
rich
viands
flesh
fish
and
and
not
to
a
nominal
entertainment
like
that
given
by
the
barmecide
in
the
who
put
off
his
visitors
with
calling
for
a
number
of
exquisite
things
that
never
appeared
and
with
the
honour
of
his
company
cobbett
is
not
a
writer
his
worst
enemy
can
not
say
that
of
him
still
less
is
he
a
vulgar
one
he
must
be
a
puny
critic
indeed
who
thinks
him
so
how
fine
were
the
graphical
descriptions
he
sent
us
from
america
what
a
transatlantic
flavour
what
a
native
gusto
what
a
fine
of
contempt
they
were
seasoned
with
if
he
had
sat
down
to
look
at
himself
in
the
glass
instead
of
looking
about
him
like
adam
in
paradise
he
would
not
have
got
up
these
articles
in
so
capital
a
style
what
a
noble
account
of
his
first
breakfast
after
his
arrival
in
america
it
might
serve
for
a
month
there
is
no
scene
on
the
stage
more
amusing
how
well
he
paints
the
gold
and
scarlet
plumage
of
the
american
birds
only
to
lament
more
pathetically
the
want
of
the
wild
of
his
native
land
the
groves
of
the
ohio
that
had
just
fallen
beneath
the
axe
stroke
in
his
description
and
the
turnips
that
he
transplanted
from
botley
green
in
prose
how
well
at
another
time
he
describes
the
poor
sheep
that
had
got
the
tick
and
had
bled
down
in
the
agonies
of
death
it
is
a
portrait
in
the
manner
of
bewick
with
the
strength
the
simplicity
and
feeling
of
that
great
naturalist
what
havoc
be
makes
when
he
pleases
of
the
curls
of

and
of
the
whig
consistency
of
mr
coleridge
his
too
is
as
entertaining
as
a
he
is
too
hard
upon
the
style
of
others
and
not
enough
sometimes
on
his
own
as
a
political
partisan
no
one
can
stand
against
him
with
his
brandished
club
like
giant
despair
in
the
he
knocks
out
their
brains
and
not
only
no
individual
but
no
corrupt
system
could
hold
out
against
his
powerful
and
repeated
attacks
but
with
the
same
weapon
swung
round
like
a
flail
that
he
levels
his
antagonists
he
lays
his
friends
low
and
puts
his
own
party
de
this
is
a
bad
propensity
and
a
worse
principle
in
political
tactics
though
a
common
one
if
his
blows
were
straightforward
and
steadily
directed
to
the
same
object
no
unpopular
minister
could
live
before
him
instead
of
which
he
lays
about
right
and
left
impartially
and
remorselessly
makes
a
clear
stage
has
all
the
ring
to
himself
and
then
runs
out
of
it
just
when
he
should
stand
his
ground
he
throws
his
head
into
his
adversary
stomach
and
takes
away
from
him
all
inclination
for
the
fight
hits
fair
or
foul
strikes
at
everything
and
as
you
come
up
to
his
aid
or
stand
ready
to
pursue
his
advantage
trips
up
your
heels
or
lays
you
sprawling
and
pummels
you
when
down
as
much
to
his
heart
content
as
ever
the
yanguesian
carriers
belaboured
rosinante
with
their
has
the
simply
the
best
of
any
man
in
illyria
he
pays
off
both
scores
of
old
friendship
and
enmity
in
a
breath
in
one
perpetual
volley
one
raking
fire
of
sleet
shot
from
his
pen
however
his
own
reputation
or
the
cause
may
suffer
in
consequence
he
cares
not
one
pin
about
that
so
that
he
disables
all
who
oppose
or
who
pretend
to
help
him
in
fact
he
can
not
bear
success
of
any
kind
not
even
of
his
own
views
or
party
and
if
any
principle
were
likely
to
become
popular
would
turn
round
against
it
to
show
his
power
in
shouldering
it
on
one
side
in
short
wherever
power
is
there
he
is
against
it
he
naturally
butts
at
all
obstacles
as
unicorns
are
attracted
to
oak
trees
and
feels
his
own
strength
only
by
resistance
to
the
opinions
and
wishes
of
the
rest
of
the
world
to
sail
with
the
stream
to
agree
with
the
company
is
not
his
humour
if
he
could
bring
about
a
reform
in
parliament
the
odds
are
that
he
would
instantly
fall
foul
of
and
try
to
mar
his
own
handiwork
and
he
quarrels
with
his
own
creatures
as
soon
as
he
has
written
them
into
a
little
vogue
and
a
prison
i
do
not
think
this
is
vanity
or
fickleness
so
much
as
a
pugnacious
disposition
that
must
have
an
antagonistic
power
to
contend
with
and
only
finds
itself
at
ease
in
systematic
opposition
if
it
were
not
for
this
the
high
towers
and
rotten
places
of
the
world
would
fall
before
the
of
his
reasoning
but
if
he
once
found
them
tottering
he
would
apply
his
strength
to
prop
them
up
and
disappoint
the
expectations
of
his
followers
he
can
not
agree
to
anything
established
nor
to
set
up
anything
else
in
its
stead
while
it
is
established
he
presses
hard
against
it
because
it
presses
upon
him
at
least
in
imagination
let
it
crumble
under
his
grasp
and
the
motive
to
resistance
is
gone
he
then
requires
some
other
grievance
to
set
his
face
against
his
principle
is
repulsion
his
nature
contradiction
he
is
made
up
of
mere
antipathies
an
ishmaelite
indeed
without
a
fellow
he
is
always
playing
at
in
politics
he
turns
round
upon
whoever
is
next
him
the
way
to
wean
him
from
any
opinion
and
make
him
conceive
an
intolerable
hatred
against
it
would
be
to
place
somebody
near
him
who
was
perpetually
dinning
it
in
his
ears
when
he
is
in
england
he
does
nothing
but
abuse
the
boroughmongers
and
laugh
at
the
whole
system
when
he
is
in
america
he
grows
impatient
of
freedom
and
a
republic
if
he
had
stayed
there
a
little
longer
he
would
have
become
a
loyal
and
a
loving
subject
of
his
majesty
king
george
iv
he
lampooned
the
french
revolution
when
it
was
hailed
as
the
dawn
of
liberty
by
millions
by
the
time
it
was
brought
into
almost
universal
by
some
means
or
other
partly
no
doubt
by
himself
he
had
turned
with
one
or
two
or
three
others
staunch
buonapartist
he
is
always
of
the
militant
not
of
the
triumphant
party
so
far
he
bears
a
gallant
show
of
magnanimity
but
his
gallantry
is
hardly
of
the
right
stamp
it
wants
principle
for
though
he
is
not
servile
or
mercenary
he
is
the
victim
of
he
must
pull
down
and
pull
in
pieces
it
is
not
in
his
disposition
to
do
otherwise
it
is
a
pity
for
with
his
great
talents
he
might
do
great
things
if
he
would
go
right
forward
to
any
useful
object
make
thorough
of
any
question
or
join
hand
and
heart
with
any
principle
he
changes
his
opinions
as
he
does
his
friends
and
much
on
the
same
account
he
has
no
comfort
in
fixed
principles
as
soon
as
anything
is
settled
in
his
own
mind
he
quarrels
with
it
he
has
no
satisfaction
but
the
chase
after
truth
runs
a
question
down
worries
and
kills
it
then
quits
it
like
a
vermin
and
starts
some
new
game
to
lead
him
a
new
dance
and
give
him
a
fresh
breathing
through
bog
and
brake
with
the
rabble
yelping
at
his
heels
and
the
leaders
perpetually
at
fault
this
he
calls
he
thinks
it
as
good
as
or
or
anything
else
that
has
life
in
it
he
likes
the
cut
and
thrust
the
falls
bruises
and
dry
blows
of
an
argument
as
to
any
good
or
useful
results
that
may
come
of
the
amicable
settling
of
it
any
one
is
welcome
to
them
for
him
the
amusement
is
over
when
the
matter
is
once
fairly
decided
there
is
another
point
of
view
in
which
this
may
be
put
i
might
say
that
cobbett
is
a
very
honest
man
with
a
total
want
of
principle
and
i
might
explain
this
paradox
thus
i
mean
that
he
is
i
think
in
downright
earnest
in
what
he
says
in
the
part
he
takes
at
the
time
but
in
taking
that
part
he
is
led
entirely
by
headstrong
obstinacy
caprice
novelty
pique
or
personal
motive
of
some
sort
and
not
by
a
steadfast
regard
for
truth
or
habitual
anxiety
for
what
is
right
uppermost
in
his
mind
he
is
not
a
fee
shuffling
advocate
no
man
could
write
as
he
does
who
did
not
believe
himself
sincere
but
his
understanding
is
the
dupe
and
slave
of
his
momentary
violent
and
irritable
humours
he
does
not
adopt
an
opinion
or
for
money
yet
his
conscience
is
at
the
mercy
of
the
first
provocation
he
receives
of
the
first
whim
he
takes
in
his
head
he
sees
things
through
the
medium
of
heat
and
passion
not
with
reference
to
any
general
principles
and
his
whole
system
of
thinking
is
deranged
by
the
first
object
that
strikes
his
fancy
or
sours
his
temper
education
he
is
a
man
and
has
the
faults
as
well
as
excellences
of
that
class
of
persons
in
their
most
striking
and
glaring
excess
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
the
editor
of
the
the
as
it
was
called
till
a
bill
passed
the
house
to
raise
the
price
to
sixpence
is
not
gentleman
and
scholar
though
he
has
qualities
that
with
a
little
better
management
would
be
worth
to
the
public
both
those
titles
for
want
of
knowing
what
has
been
discovered
before
him
he
has
not
certain
general
landmarks
to
refer
to
or
a
general
standard
of
thought
to
apply
to
individual
cases
he
relies
on
his
own
acuteness
and
the
immediate
evidence
without
being
acquainted
with
the
comparative
anatomy
or
philosophical
structure
of
opinion
he
does
not
view
things
on
a
large
scale
or
at
the
horizon
dim
and
airy
enough
perhaps
but
as
they
affect
himself
close
palpable
tangible
whatever
he
finds
out
is
his
own
and
he
only
knows
what
he
finds
out
he
is
in
the
constant
hurry
and
fever
of
gestation
his
brain
teems
incessantly
with
some
fresh
project
every
new
light
is
the
birth
of
a
new
system
the
dawn
of
a
new
world
outstripping
and
overreaching
himself
the
last
opinion
is
the
only
true
one
he
is
wiser
than
he
was
yesterday
why
should
he
not
be
wiser
than
he
was
men
of
a
learned
education
are
not
so
as
clever
men
without
it
but
they
know
the
balance
of
the
human
intellect
better
if
they
are
more
stupid
they
are
more
steady
and
are
less
liable
to
be
led
astray
by
their
own
sagacity
and
the
overweening
petulance
of
and
wisdom
they
do
not
fall
in
love
with
every
meretricious
extravagance
at
first
sight
or
mistake
an
old
battered
hypothesis
for
a
vestal
because
they
are
new
to
the
ways
of
this
old
world
they
do
not
seize
upon
it
as
a
prize
but
are
safe
from
gross
imposition
by
being
as
wise
and
no
wiser
than
those
who
went
before
them
paine
said
on
some
occasion
i
have
written
i
have
written
as
rendering
any
further
declaration
of
his
principles
unnecessary
not
so
cobbett
what
he
has
written
is
no
rule
to
him
what
he
is
to
write
maintain
the
opinions
of
the
last
six
days
against
friend
or
foe
i
doubt
whether
this
outrageous
inconsistency
this
headstrong
fickleness
this
understood
want
of
all
rule
and
method
does
not
enable
him
to
go
on
with
the
spirit
vigour
and
variety
that
he
does
he
is
not
pledged
to
repeat
himself
every
new
is
a
kind
of
new
prospectus
he
blesses
himself
from
all
ties
and
shackles
on
his
understanding
he
has
no
mortgages
on
his
brain
his
notions
are
free
and
unencumbered
if
he
was
put
in
trammels
he
might
become
a
vile
hack
like
so
many
more
but
he
gives
himself
scope
and
verge
enough
he
takes
both
sides
of
a
question
and
maintains
one
as
sturdily
as
the
other
if
nobody
else
can
argue
against
him
he
is
a
very
good
match
for
himself
he
writes
better
in
favour
of
reform
than
anybody
else
he
used
to
write
better
against
it
wherever
he
is
there
is
the
tug
of
war
the
weight
of
the
argument
the
strength
of
abuse
he
is
not
like
a
man
in
danger
of
being
in
his
faculties
he
tosses
and
tumbles
about
his
unwieldy
bulk
and
when
he
is
tired
of
lying
on
one
side
relieves
himself
by
turning
on
the
other
his
shifting
his
point
of
view
from
time
to
time
not
merely
adds
variety
and
greater
compass
to
his
topics
so
that
the
is
an
armoury
and
magazine
for
all
the
materials
and
weapons
of
political
warfare
but
it
gives
a
greater
zest
and
liveliness
to
his
manner
of
treating
them
cobbett
takes
nothing
for
granted
as
what
he
has
proved
before
he
does
not
write
a
book
of
reference
we
see
his
ideas
in
their
first
concoction
fermenting
and
overflowing
with
the
ebullitions
of
a
lively
conception
we
look
on
at
the
actual
process
and
are
put
in
immediate
possession
of
the
grounds
and
materials
on
which
he
forms
his
sanguine
unsettled
conclusions
he
does
not
give
us
samples
of
reasoning
but
the
whole
solid
mass
refuse
and
all
he
pours
out
all
as
plain
as
downright
shippen
or
as
old
montaigne
this
is
one
cause
of
the
clearness
and
force
of
his
writings
an
argument
does
not
stop
to
stagnate
and
muddle
in
his
brain
but
passes
at
once
to
his
paper
his
ideas
are
served
up
like
pancakes
hot
and
hot
fresh
theories
give
him
fresh
courage
he
is
like
a
young
and
lusty
bridegroom
that
divorces
a
favourite
speculation
every
morning
and
marries
a
new
one
every
night
he
is
not
wedded
to
his
notions
not
he
he
has
not
one
cobbett
among
all
his
opinions
he
makes
the
most
of
the
last
thought
that
has
come
in
his
way
seizes
fast
hold
of
it
rumbles
it
about
in
all
directions
with
rough
strong
hands
has
his
wicked
will
of
it
takes
a
surfeit
and
throws
it
our
changing
his
opinions
for
new
ones
is
not
so
wonderful
what
is
more
remarkable
is
his
facility
in
forgetting
his
old
ones
he
does
not
pretend
to
consistency
like
coleridge
he
frankly
disavows
all
connection
with
himself
he
feels
no
personal
responsibility
in
this
way
and
cuts
a
friend
or
principle
with
the
same
decided
indifference
that
antipholis
of
ephesus
cuts
aegeon
of
syracuse
it
is
a
hollow
thing
the
only
time
he
ever
grew
romantic
was
in
bringing
over
the
relics
of
thomas
paine
with
him
from
america
to
go
a
progress
with
them
through
the
disaffected
districts
scarce
had
he
landed
in
liverpool
when
he
left
the
bones
of
a
great
man
to
shift
for
themselves
and
no
sooner
did
he
arrive
in
london
than
he
made
a
speech
to
disclaim
all
participation
in
the
political
and
theological
sentiments
of
his
late
idol
and
to
place
the
whole
stock
of
his
admiration
and
enthusiasm
towards
him
to
the
account
of
his
financial
speculations
and
of
his
having
predicted
the
fate
of
if
he
had
erected
a
little
gold
statue
to
him
it
might
have
proved
the
sincerity
of
this
assertion
but
to
make
a
martyr
and
a
patron
saint
of
a
man
and
to
dig
up
canonised
bones
in
order
to
expose
them
as
objects
of
devotion
to
the
rabble
gaze
asks
something
that
has
more
life
and
spirit
in
it
more
mind
and
vivifying
soul
than
has
to
do
with
any
calculation
of
pounds
shillings
and
pence
the
fact
is
he
from
his
own
project
he
found
the
thing
not
so
ripe
as
he
had
expected
his
heart
failed
him
his
enthusiasm
fled
and
he
made
his
retractation
his
admiration
is
his
contempt
only
is
rooted
and
his
resentment
the
above
was
only
one
instance
of
his
building
too
much
on
practical
he
has
an
ill
habit
of
prophesying
and
goes
on
though
still
decieved
the
art
of
prophesying
does
not
suit
cobbett
style
he
has
a
knack
of
fixing
names
and
times
and
places
according
to
him
the
reformed
parliament
was
to
meet
in
march
it
did
not
and
we
heard
no
more
of
the
matter
when
his
predictions
fail
he
takes
no
further
notice
of
them
but
applies
himself
to
new
ones
like
the
country
people
who
turn
to
see
what
weather
there
is
in
the
almanac
for
the
next
week
though
it
has
been
out
in
its
reckoning
every
day
of
the
last
cobbett
is
great
in
attack
not
in
defence
he
can
not
fight
an
battle
he
will
not
bear
the
least
punishing
if
any
one
turns
upon
him
which
few
people
like
to
do
he
immediately
turns
tail
like
an
overgrown
schoolboy
he
is
so
used
to
have
it
all
his
own
way
that
he
can
not
submit
to
anything
like
competition
or
a
struggle
for
the
mastery
he
must
lay
on
all
the
blows
and
take
none
he
is
bullying
and
cowardly
a
big
ben
in
politics
who
will
fall
upon
others
and
crush
them
by
his
weight
but
is
not
prepared
for
resistance
and
is
soon
staggered
by
a
few
smart
blows
whenever
he
has
been
set
upon
he
has
slunk
out
of
the
controversy
the
made
what
is
called
a
dead
set
at
him
some
years
ago
to
which
he
only
retorted
by
an
eulogy
on
the
superior
neatness
of
an
english
to
a
scotch
one
i
remember
going
one
day
into
a
bookseller
shop
in
fleet
street
to
ask
for
the
and
on
my
expressing
my
opinion
to
a
young
scotchman
who
stood
behind
the
counter
that
cobbett
might
hit
as
hard
in
his
reply
the
north
briton
said
with
some
alarm
you
do
think
sir
cobbett
will
be
able
to
injure
the
scottish
nation
i
said
i
could
not
speak
to
that
point
but
i
thought
he
was
very
well
able
to
defend
himself
he
however
did
not
but
has
borne
a
grudge
to
the
ever
since
which
he
hates
worse
than
the
i
can
not
say
i
do
notes
to
essay
vi
the
late
lord
thurlow
used
to
say
that
cobbett
was
the
only
writer
that
deserved
the
name
of
a
political
reasoner
cobbett
speaks
almost
as
well
as
he
writes
the
only
time
l
ever
saw
him
he
seemed
to
me
a
very
pleasant
man
easy
of
access
affable
simple
and
mild
in
his
manner
deliberate
and
unruffled
in
his
speech
though
some
of
his
expressions
were
not
very
qualified
his
figure
is
tall
and
portly
he
has
a
good
sensible
face
rather
full
with
little
grey
eyes
a
hard
square
forehead
a
ruddy
complexion
with
hair
grey
or
powdered
and
had
on
a
scarlet
broadcloth
waistcoat
with
the
flaps
of
the
pockets
hanging
down
as
was
the
custom
for
in
the
last
century
or
as
we
see
it
in
the
pictures
of
members
of
parliament
in
the
reign
of
george
i
certainly
did
not
think
less
favourably
of
him
for
seeing
him
essay
vii
on
people
with
one
idea
there
are
people
who
have
but
one
idea
at
least
if
they
have
more
they
keep
it
a
secret
for
they
never
talk
but
of
one
subject
there
is
major
cartwright
he
has
but
one
idea
or
subject
of
discourse
parliamentary
reform
now
parliamentary
reform
is
as
far
as
i
know
a
very
good
subject
to
talk
about
but
why
should
it
be
the
only
one
to
hear
the
worthy
and
gallant
major
resume
his
favourite
topic
is
like
or
a
person
who
has
a
suit
in
chancery
going
on
nothing
can
be
attended
to
nothing
can
be
talked
of
but
that
now
it
is
getting
on
now
again
it
is
standing
still
at
one
time
the
master
has
promised
to
pass
judgment
by
a
certain
day
at
another
he
has
put
it
off
again
and
called
for
more
papers
and
both
are
equally
reasons
for
speaking
of
it
like
the
piece
of
packthread
in
the
barrister
hands
he
turns
and
twists
it
all
ways
and
can
not
proceed
a
step
without
it
some
schoolboys
can
not
read
but
in
their
own
book
and
the
man
of
one
idea
can
not
converse
out
of
his
own
subject
conversation
it
is
not
but
a
sort
of
recital
of
the
preamble
of
a
bill
or
a
collection
of
grave
arguments
for
a
man
being
of
opinion
with
himself
it
would
be
well
if
there
was
anything
of
character
of
eccentricity
in
all
this
but
that
is
not
the
case
it
is
a
political
homily
personified
a
walking
we
have
to
encounter
and
listen
to
it
is
just
as
if
a
man
was
to
insist
on
your
hearing
him
go
through
the
fifth
chapter
of
the
book
of
judges
every
time
you
meet
or
like
the
story
of
the
cosmogony
in
the
of
it
is
a
tune
played
on
a
it
is
a
common
vehicle
of
discourse
into
which
they
get
and
are
set
down
when
they
please
without
any
pain
or
trouble
to
themselves
neither
is
it
professional
pedantry
or
trading
quackery
it
has
no
excuse
the
man
has
no
more
to
do
with
the
question
which
he
saddles
on
all
his
hearers
than
you
have
this
is
what
makes
the
matter
hopeless
if
a
farmer
talks
to
you
about
his
pigs
or
his
poultry
or
a
physician
about
his
patients
or
a
lawyer
about
his
briefs
or
a
merchant
about
stock
or
an
author
about
himself
you
know
how
to
account
for
this
it
is
a
common
infirmity
you
have
a
laugh
at
his
expense
and
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
but
here
is
a
man
who
goes
out
of
his
way
to
be
absurd
and
is
troublesome
by
a
romantic
effort
of
generosity
you
can
not
say
to
him
this
may
be
interesting
to
you
but
i
have
no
concern
in
it
you
can
not
put
him
off
in
that
way
he
retorts
the
latin
adage
upon
humani
a
me
alienum
he
has
got
possession
of
a
subject
which
is
of
universal
and
paramount
interest
not
due
to
some
single
breast
and
on
that
plea
may
hold
you
by
the
button
as
long
as
he
chooses
his
delight
is
to
harangue
on
what
nowise
regards
himself
how
then
can
you
refuse
to
listen
to
what
as
little
amuses
you
time
and
tide
wait
for
no
man
the
business
of
the
state
admits
of
no
delay
the
question
of
universal
suffrage
and
annual
parliaments
stands
first
on
the
order
of
the
day
takes
precedence
in
its
own
right
of
every
other
question
any
other
topic
grave
or
gay
is
looked
upon
in
the
light
of
impertinence
and
sent
business
is
an
interruption
pleasure
a
digression
from
it
it
is
the
question
before
every
company
where
the
major
comes
which
immediately
resolves
itself
into
a
committee
of
the
whole
upon
it
is
carried
on
by
means
of
a
perpetual
virtual
adjournment
and
it
is
presumed
that
no
other
is
entertained
while
this
is
pending
a
determination
which
gives
its
persevering
advocate
a
fair
prospect
of
expatiating
on
it
to
his
dying
day
as
cicero
says
of
study
it
follows
him
into
the
country
it
stays
with
him
at
home
it
sits
with
him
at
breakfast
and
goes
out
with
him
to
dinner
it
is
like
a
part
of
his
dress
of
the
costume
of
his
person
without
which
he
would
be
at
a
loss
what
to
do
if
he
meets
you
in
the
street
he
accosts
you
with
it
as
a
form
of
salutation
if
you
see
him
at
his
own
house
it
is
supposed
you
come
upon
that
if
you
happen
to
remark
is
a
fine
day
or
town
is
full
it
is
considered
as
a
temporary
compromise
of
the
question
you
are
suspected
of
not
going
the
whole
length
of
the
principle
as
sancho
when
reprimanded
for
mentioning
his
homely
favourite
in
the
duke
kitchen
defended
himself
by
saying
i
thought
of
dapple
and
there
i
spoke
of
him
so
the
true
stickler
for
reform
neglects
no
opportunity
of
introducing
the
subject
wherever
he
is
place
its
veteran
champion
under
the
frozen
north
and
he
will
celebrate
sweet
smiling
reform
place
him
under
the
afric
suns
and
he
will
talk
of
nothing
but
reform
reform
so
sweetly
smiling
and
so
sweetly
promising
for
the
last
forty
years
dulce
ridentem
lalagen
dulce
loquentem
a
topic
of
this
sort
of
which
the
person
himself
may
be
considered
as
almost
sole
proprietor
and
patentee
is
an
estate
for
life
free
from
all
encumbrance
of
wit
thought
or
study
you
live
upon
it
as
a
settled
income
and
others
might
as
well
think
to
eject
you
out
of
a
capital
freehold
house
and
estate
as
think
to
drive
you
out
of
it
into
the
wide
world
of
common
sense
and
argument
every
man
house
is
his
castle
and
every
man
is
his
stronghold
from
which
he
looks
out
and
smiles
at
the
dust
and
heat
of
controversy
raised
by
a
number
of
frivolous
and
vexatious
questions
the
world
with
the
vain
stir
a
cure
for
this
and
every
other
evil
would
be
a
parliamentary
reform
and
so
we
return
in
a
perpetual
circle
to
the
point
from
which
we
set
out
is
not
this
a
species
of
sober
madness
more
provoking
than
the
real
has
not
the
theoretical
enthusiast
his
mind
as
much
warped
as
much
enslaved
by
one
idea
as
the
acknowledged
lunatic
only
that
the
former
has
no
lucid
intervals
if
you
see
a
visionary
of
this
class
going
along
the
street
you
can
tell
as
well
what
he
is
thinking
of
and
will
say
next
as
the
man
that
fancies
himself
a
teapot
or
the
czar
of
muscovy
the
one
is
as
inaccessible
to
reason
as
the
other
if
the
one
raves
the
other
dotes
there
are
some
who
fancy
the
corn
bill
the
root
of
all
evil
and
others
who
trace
all
the
miseries
of
life
to
the
practice
of
muffling
up
children
in
when
they
sleep
or
travel
they
will
declaim
by
the
hour
together
on
the
first
and
argue
themselves
black
in
the
face
on
the
last
it
is
in
vain
that
you
give
up
the
point
they
persist
in
the
debate
and
begin
again
do
you
see
these
sort
of
partial
obliquities
as
they
are
more
entertaining
and
original
are
also
by
their
nature
intermittent
they
hold
a
man
but
for
a
season
he
may
have
one
a
year
or
every
two
years
and
though
while
he
is
in
the
heat
of
any
new
discovery
he
will
let
you
hear
of
nothing
else
he
varies
from
himself
and
is
amusing
undesignedly
he
is
not
like
the
chimes
at
midnight
people
of
the
character
here
spoken
of
that

who
tease
you
to
death
with
some
one
idea
generally
differ
in
their
favourite
notion
from
the
rest
of
the
world
and
indeed
it
is
the
love
of
distinction
which
is
mostly
at
the
bottom
of
this
peculiarity
thus
one
person
is
remarkable
for
living
on
a
vegetable
diet
and
never
fails
to
entertain
you
all
with
an
invective
against
animal
food
one
of
this
class
who
adds
to
the
primitive
simplicity
of
this
sort
of
food
the
recommendation
of
having
it
in
a
raw
state
lamenting
the
death
of
a
patient
whom
he
had
augured
to
be
in
a
good
way

it

to
willingly

you

complaining
to

physician
that
he
thought
his
mode
of
treatment
had
not
answered
he
assured
him
it
was

in

had
one
gentleman
a

with

under
the
same
regimen
for
the
last
sixteen
years
l
have
known
persons
whose
minds
were
entirely
taken
up
at
all
times
and
on
all
occasions
with
such
questions
as
the
abolition
of
the
slave
trade
the
restoration
of
the
jews
or
the
progress
of
unitarianism
i
myself
at
one
period
took
a
pretty
strong
turn
to
inveighing
against
the
doctrine
of
divine
right
and
am
not
yet
cured
of
my
prejudice
on
that
subject
how
many
projectors
have
gone
mad
in
good
earnest
from
incessantly
harping
on
one
idea
the
discovery
of

fatal
crisis
but
long
before
this
and
while
they
were
walking
about
and
talking
as
usual
the
derangement
of
the
fancy
the
loss
of
all
voluntary
power
to
control
or
alienate
their
ideas
from
the
single
subject
that
occupied
them
was
gradually
taking
place
and
overturning
the
fabric
of
the
understanding

wrenching
it
all
on

side

but
what

a
scotchman
always
leads
the
discourse
to
his
own
country
some
descant
on
the
kantean
philosophy
there
is
a
conceited
fellow
about
town
who
talks
always
and
everywhere
on
this
subject
he
wears
the
categories
round
his
neck
like
a
he
plays
off
the
names
of
the
primary
and
transcendental
qualities
like
rings
on
his
fingers
he
talks
of
the
kantean
system
while
he
dances
he
talks
of
it
while
he
dines
he
talks
of
it
to
his
children
to
his
apprentices
to
his
customers
he
called
on
me
to
convince
me
of
it
and
said
i
was
only
prevented
from
becoming
a
complete
convert
by
one
or
two
prejudices
he
knows
no
more
about
it
than
a
pikestaff
why
then
does
he
make
so
much
ridiculous
fuss
about
it
it
is
not
that
he
has
got
this
one
idea
in
his
head
but
that
he
has
got
no
other
a
dunce
may
talk
on
the
subject
of
the
kantean
philosophy
with
great
impunity
if
he
opened
his
lips
on
any
other
he
might
be
found

french
lady
who
had
married
an
englishman
who
said
little
excused
him
by
saying

always
thinking
of
locke
and
newton
this
is
one
way
of
passing
muster
by
following
in
the
suite
of
great
names
a
friend
of
mine
whom
i
met
one
day
in
the
street
accosted
me
with
more
than
usual
vivacity
and
said
we
selling
selling
i
thought
he
meant
a
house
he
said
you
seen
the
advertisement
in
the
newspapers
i
mean
five
and
twenty
copies
of
the
essay
this
work
a
comely
capacious
quarto
on
the
most
abstruse
metaphysics
had
occupied
his
sole
thoughts
for
several
years
and
he
concluded
that
i
must
be
thinking
of
what
he
was
i
believe
however
i
may
say
i
am
nearly
the
only
person
that
ever
read
certainly
that
ever
pretended
to
understand
it
it
is
an
original
and
most
ingenious
work
nearly
as
incomprehensible
as
it
is
original
and
as
quaint
as
it
is
ingenious
if
the
author
is
taken
up
with
the
ideas
in
his
own
head
and
no
others
he
has
a
right
for
he
has
ideas
there
that
are
to
be
met
with
nowhere
else
and
which
occasionally
would
not
disgrace
a
berkeley
a
dextrous
plagiarist
might
get
himself
an
immense
reputation
by
putting
them
in
a
popular
dress
oh
how
little
do
they
know
who
have
never
done
anything
but
repeat
after
others
by
rote
the
pangs
the
labour
the
yearnings
and
misgivings
of
mind
it
costs
to
get
at
the
germ
of
an
original
idea
to
dig
it
out
of
the
hidden
recesses
of
thought
and
nature
and
bring
it
struggling
and
deformed
into
the
day
to
give
words
and
intelligible
symbols
to
that
which
was
never
imagined
or
expressed
before
it
is
as
if
the
dumb
should
speak
for
the
first
time
as
if
things
should
stammer
out
their
own
meaning
through
the
imperfect
organs
of
mere
sense
i
wish
that
some
of
our
fluent
plausible
declaimers
who
have
such
store
of
words
to
cover
the
want
of
ideas
could
lend
their
art
to
this
writer
if
he
unfledged
in
this
respect

was
buried
in
the
woods
of
indostan
in
his
leisure
from
business
and
from
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
look
into
his
own
mind
a
whim
or
two
an
odd
fancy
like
a
film
before
the
eye
now
and
then
crossed
it
it
struck
him
as
something
curious
but
the
impression
at
first
disappeared
like
breath
upon
glass
he
thought
no
more
of
it
yet
still
the
same
conscious
feelings
returned
and
what
at
first
was
chance
or
instinct
became
a
habit
several
notions
had
taken
possession
of
his
brain
relating
to
mental
processes
which
he
had
never
heard
alluded
to
in
conversation
but
not
being
well
versed
in
such
matters
he
did
not
know
whether
they
were
to
be
found
in
learned

did

what

looked
for
he
set
to
work
himself
and
in
a
few
weeks
sketched
out
a
rough
draft
of
his
thoughts
and
observations
on
bamboo
paper
the
eagerness
of
his
new
pursuit
together
with
the
diseases
of
the
climate
proved
too
much
for
his
constitution
and
he
was
forced
to
return
to
this
country
he
put
his
metaphysics
his
bamboo
manuscript
into
the
boat
with
him
and
as
he
floated
down

said
to
himself
i

this
will
live
if
i

it
will
not
be

of
what

work
home
with

he
allowed
was

the
improved
copy
he
thought
could
not
fail
to
strike
it
did
not
succeed
the
world
as
goldsmith
said
of
himself
made
a
point
of
taking
no
notice
of
it
ever
since
he
has
had
nothing
but
disappointment
and
vexation
the
greatest
and
most
of
all
others
that
of
not
being
able
to
make
yourself
understood
fearn
tells
me
there
is
a
sensible
writer
in
the
who
sees
the
thing
in
its
proper
light
and
says
so
but
i
have
heard
of
no
other
instance
there
are
notwithstanding
ideas
in
this
work
neglected
and
as
it
has
been
that
lead
to
more
curious
and
subtle
speculations
on
some
of
the
most
disputed
and
difficult
points
of
the
philosophy
of
the
human
mind
such
as
etc
than
have
been
thrown
out
in
any
work
for
the
last
sixty
years
i
mean
since
hume
for
since
his
time
there
has
been
no
metaphysician
in
this
country
worth
the
name
yet
his
on
human
he
tells
us
from
the
press
so
it
is
that
knowledge
works
its
way
and
reputation
lingers
far
behind
it
but
truth
is
better
than
opinion
i
maintain
it
and
as
to
the
two
stereotyped
and
unsold
editions
of
the
essay
on
consciousness
i
say
soit
qui
mal
y
pense
my
uncle
toby
had
one
idea
in
his
head
that
of
his
and
another
that
of
the
widow
wadman
oh
spare
them
both
i
will
only
add
one
more
anecdote
in
illustration
of
this
theory
of
the
mind
being
occupied
with
one
idea
which
is
most
frequently
of
a
man
self
a
celebrated
lyrical
writer
happened
to
drop
into
a
small
party
where
they
had
just
got
the
novel
of
roy
by
the
author
of
the
motto
in
the
was
taken
from
a
poem
of
his
this
was
a
hint
sufficient
a
word
to
the
wise
he
instantly
went
to
the
in
the
next
room
took
down
the
volume
of
his
own
poems
read
the
whole
of
that
in
question
aloud
with
manifest
complacency
replaced
it
on
the
shelf
and
walked
away
taking
no
more
notice
of
rob
roy
than
if
there
had
been
no
such
person
nor
of
the
new
novel
than
if
it
had
not
been
written
by
its
renowned
author
there
was
no
reciprocity
in
this
but
the
writer
in
question
does
not
admit
of
any
merit
second
to
his
own
owen
is
a
man
remarkable
for
one
idea
it
is
that
of
himself
and
the
lanark
he
carries
this
idea
backwards
and
forwards
with
him
from
glasgow
to
london
without
allowing
anything
for
attrition
and
expects
to
find
it
in
the
same
state
of
purity
and
perfection
in
the
latter
place
as
at
the
former
he
acquires
a
wonderful
velocity
and
impenetrability
in
his
undaunted
transit
resistance
to
him
is
vain
while
the
whirling
motion
of
the
remains
in
his
head
nor
alps
nor
apennines
can
keep
him
out
nor
fortified
redoubt
he
even
got
possession
in
the
suddenness
of
his
onset
of
the
of
the
newspaper
and
struck
off
ten
thousand
woodcuts
of
the
projected
villages
which
afforded
an
ocular
demonstration
to
all
who
saw
them
of
the
practicability
of
whole
scheme
he
comes
into
a
room
with
one
of
these
documents
in
his
hand
with
the
air
of
a
schoolmaster
and
a
quack
doctor
mixed
asks
very
kindly
how
you
do
and
on
hearing
you
are
still
in
an
indifferent
state
of
health
owing
to
bad
digestion
instantly
turns
round
and
observes
that
that
will
be
remedied
in
his
plan
that
indeed
he
thinks
too
much
attention
has
been
paid
to
the
mind
and
not
enough
to
the
body
that
in
his
system
which
he
has
now
perfected
and
which
will
shortly
be
generally
adopted
he
has
provided
effectually
for
both
that
he
has
been
long
of
opinion
that
the
mind
depends
altogether
on
the
physical
organisation
and
where
the
latter
is
neglected
or
disordered
the
former
must
languish
and
want
its
due
vigour
that
exercise
is
therefore
a
part
of
his
system
with
full
liberty
to
develop
every
faculty
of
mind
and
body
that
two
objections
had
been
made
to
his
view
of
viz
its
want
of
relaxation
from
labour
and
its
want
of
variety
but
the
first
of
these
the
too
great
restraint
he
trusted
he
had
already
answered
for
where
the
powers
of
mind
and
body
were
freely
exercised
and
brought
out
surely
liberty
must
be
allowed
to
exist
in
the
highest
degree
and
as
to
the
second
the
monotony
which
would
be
produced
by
a
regular
and
general
plan
of
he
conceived
he
had
proved
in
his
and
to
the
higher
that
the
he
had
recommended
was
necessarily
conducive
to
the
most
extensive
improvement
of
the
ideas
and
faculties
and
where
this
was
the
case
there
must
be
the
greatest
possible
variety
instead
of
a
want
of
it
and
having
said
this
this
expert
and
sweeping
orator
takes
up
his
hat
and
walks
downstairs
after
reading
his
lecture
of
truisms
like
a
playbill
or
an
apothecary
advertisement
and
should
you
stop
him
at
the
door
to
say
by
way
of
putting
in
a
word
in
common
that
southey
seems
somewhat
favourable
to
his
plan
in
his
late
letter
to
william
smith
he
looks
at
you
with
a
smile
of
pity
at
the
futility
of
all
opposition
and
the
idleness
of
all
encouragement
people
who
thus
swell
out
some
vapid
scheme
of
their
own
into
undue
importance
seem
to
me
to
labour
under
water
in
the
head
to
exhibit
a
huge
hydrocephalus
they
may
be
very
worthy
people
for
all
that
but
they
are
bad
companions
and
very
indifferent
reasoners
tom
moore
says
of
some
one
somewhere
he
puts
his
hand
in
his
breeches
pocket
like
a
crocodile
the
phrase
is
hieroglyphical
but
owen
and
others
might
be
said
to
put
their
foot
in
the
question
of
social
improvement
and
reform
much
in
the
same
unaccountable
manner
i
hate
to
be
surfeited
with
anything
however
sweet
i
do
not
want
to
be
always
tied
to
the
same
question
as
if
there
were
no
other
in
the
world
i
like
a
mind
more
catholic
i
love
to
talk
with
mariners
that
come
from
a
far
countree
i
am
not
for
collusion
but
exchange
of
ideas
it
is
well
to
hear
what
other
people
have
to
say
on
a
number
of
subjects
i
do
not
wish
to
be
always
respiring
the
same
confined
atmosphere
but
to
vary
the
scene
and
get
a
little
relief
and
fresh
air
out
of
doors
do
all
we
can
to
shake
it
off
there
is
always
enough
pedantry
egotism
and
left
lurking
behind
we
need
not
seal
ourselves
up
hermetically
in
these
precious
qualities
so
as
to
think
of
nothing
but
our
own
wonderful
discoveries
and
hear
nothing
but
the
sound
of
our
own
voice
scholars
like
princes
may
learn
something
by
being
incognito
yet
we
see
those
who
can
not
go
into
a
bookseller
shop
or
bear
to
be
five
minutes
in
a
without
letting
you
know
who
they
are
they
carry
their
reputation
about
with
them
as
the
snail
does
its
shell
and
sit
under
its
canopy
like
the
lady
in
the
lobster
i
can
not
understand
this
at
all
what
is
the
use
of
a
man
always
revolving
round
his
own
little
circle
he
must
one
should
think
be
tired
of
it
himself
as
well
as
tire
other
people
a
writer
says
with
much
boldness
both
in
the
thought
and
expression
that
lord
is
imprisoned
in
the
bastille
of
a
name
and
can
not
enlarge
himself
into
man
and
i
have
known
men
of
genius
in
the
same
predicament
why
must
a
man
be
for
ever
mouthing
out
his
own
poetry
comparing
himself
with
milton
passage
by
passage
and
weighing
every
line
in
a
balance
of
posthumous
fame
which
he
holds
in
his
own
hands
it
argues
a
want
of
imagination
as
well
as
common
sense
has
he
no
ideas
but
what
he
has
put
into
verse
or
none
in
common
with
his
hearers
why
should
he
think
it
the
only
thing
the
only
extant
to
see
the
merit
of
his
writings
and
that
were
brutes
without
them
why
should
he
bear
a
grudge
to
all
art
to
all
beauty
to
all
wisdom
that
does
not
spring
from
his
own
brain
or
why
should
he
fondly
imagine
that
there
is
but
one
fine
thing
in
the
world
namely
poetry
and
that
he
is
the
only
poet
in
it
it
will
never
do
poetry
is
a
very
fine
thing
but
there
are
other
things
besides
it
everything
must
have
its
turn
does
a
wise
man
think
to
enlarge
his
comprehension
by
turning
his
eyes
only
on
himself
or
hope
to
conciliate
the
admiration
of
others
by
scouting
proscribing
and
loathing
all
that
they
delight
in
he
must
either
have
a
disproportionate
idea
of
himself
or
be
ignorant
of
the
world
in
which
he
lives
it
is
quite
enough
to
have
one
class
of
people
born
to
think
the
universe
made
for
them
it
seems
also
to
argue
a
want
of
repose
of
confidence
and
firm
faith
in
a
man
real
pretensions
to
be
always
dragging
them
forward
into
the
foreground
as
if
the
proverb
held
here
of
sight
out
of
does
he
for
instance
conceive
that
no
one
would
ever
think
of
his
poetry
unless
he
forced
it
upon
them
by
repeating
it
himself
does
he
believe
all
competition
all
allowance
of
another
merit
fatal
to
him
must
he
like
moody
in
the
lock
up
the
faculties
of
his
admirers
in
ignorance
of
all
other
fine
things
painting
music
the
antique
lest
they
should
play
truant
to
him
methinks
such
a
proceeding
implies
no
good
opinion
of
his
own
genius
or
their
taste
it
is
deficient
in
dignity
and
in
decorum
surely
if
any
one
is
convinced
of
the
reality
of
an
acquisition
he
can
bear
not
to
have
it
spoken
of
every
minute
if
he
knows
he
has
an
undoubted
superiority
in
any
respect
he
will
not
be
uneasy
because
every
one
he
meets
is
not
in
the
secret
nor
staggered
by
the
report
of
rival
excellence
one
of
the
first
mathematicians
and
classical
scholars
of
the
day
was
mentioning
it
as
a
compliment
to
himself
that
a
cousin
of
his
a
girl
from
school
had
said
to
him
know
manning
is
a
very
plain
good
sort
of
a
young
man
but
he
is
not
anything
at
all
out
of
the
common
leigh
hunt
once
said
to
me
wonder
i
never
heard
you
speak
upon
this
subject
before
which
you
seem
to
have
studied
a
good
deal
i
answered
we
were
not
reduced
to
that
that
i
know
of
there
are
persons
who
without
being
chargeable
with
the
vice
here
spoken
of
yet
accountant
for
as
great
a
sin
though
not
dull
and
monotonous
they
are
vivacious
mannerists
in
their
conversation
and
excessive
egotists
though
they
run
over
a
thousand
subjects
in
mere
gaiety
of
heart
their
delight
still
flows
from
one
idea
namely
themselves
open
the
book
in
what
page
you
will
there
is
a
frontispiece
of
themselves
staring
you
in
the
face
they
are
a
sort
of
jacks
o
the
green
with
a
sprig
of
laurel
a
little
tinsel
and
a
little
smut
but
still
playing
antics
and
keeping
in
incessant
motion
to
attract
attention
and
extort
your
pittance
of
approbation
whether
they
talk
of
the
town
or
the
country
poetry
or
politics
it
comes
to
much
the
same
thing
if
they
talk
to
you
of
the
town
its
diversions
palaces
its
ladies
and
its
streets
they
are
the
delight
the
grace
and
ornament
of
it
if
they
are
describing
the
charms
of
the
country
they
give
no
account
of
any
individual
spot
or
object
or
source
of
pleasure
but
the
circumstance
of
their
being
there
them
conversing
we
forget
all
place
all
seasons
and
their
change
they
perhaps
pluck
a
leaf
or
a
flower
patronise
it
and
hand
it
you
to
admire
but
select
no
one
feature
of
beauty
or
grandeur
to
dispute
the
palm
of
perfection
with
their
own
persons
their
rural
descriptions
are
mere
landscape
backgrounds
with
their
own
portraits
in
an
engaging
attitude
in
front
they
are
not
observing
or
enjoying
the
scene
but
doing
the
honours
as
masters
of
the
ceremonies
to
nature
and
arbiters
of
elegance
to
all
humanity
if
they
tell
a
of
enamoured
princesses
it
is
plain
they
fancy
themselves
the
hero
of
the
piece
if
they
discuss
poetry
their
encomiums
still
turn
on
something
genial
and
unsophisticated
meaning
their
own
style
if
they
enter
into
politics
it
is
understood
that
a
hint
from
them
to
the
potentates
of
europe
is
sufficient
in
short
as
a
lover
talk
of
what
you
will
brings
in
his
mistress
at
every
turn
so
these
persons
contrive
to
divert
your
attention
to
the
same
darling
object
they
are
in
fact
in
love
with
themselves

of
reasoning
or
of
striking
out
any
observation
that
is
not
mechanically
suggested
to
him
by
parsing
his
eyes
over
certain
legible
characters
shrinks
from
the
fatigue
of
thought
which
for
want
of
practice
becomes
insupportable
to
him
and
sits
down
contented
with
an
endless
wearisome
succession
of
words
and
images
which
fill
the
void
of
the
mind
and
continually
efface
one
another
learning
is
in
too
many
cases
but
a
foil
to
common
sense
a
substitute
for
true
knowledge
books
are
less
often
made
use
of
as
to
look
at
nature
with
than
as
blinds
to
keep
out
its
strong
light
and
shifting
scenery
from
weak
eyes
and
indolent
dispositions
the
wraps
himself
up
in
his
web
of
verbal
generalities
and
sees
only
the
glimmering
shadows
of
things
reflected
from
the
minds
of
others
nature
him
the
impressions
of
real
objects
stripped
of
the
disguises
of
words
and
voluminous
roundabout
descriptions
are
blows
that
stagger
him
their
variety
distracts
their
rapidity
exhausts
him
and
he
turns
from
the
bustle
the
noise
and
glare
and
whirling
motion
of
the
world
about
him
which
he
has
not
an
eye
to
follow
in
its
fantastic
changes
nor
an
understanding
to
reduce
to
fixed
principles
to
the
quiet
monotony
of
the
dead
languages
and
the
less
startling
and
more
intelligible
combinations
of
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
it
is
well
it
is
perfectly
well
me
to
my
repose
is
the
motto
of
the
sleeping
and
the
dead
you
might
as
well
ask
the
paralytic
to
leap
from
his
chair
and
throw
away
his
crutch
or
without
a
miracle
to
up
his
bed
and
walk
as
expect
the
learned
reader
to
throw
down
his
book
and
think
for
himself
he
clings
to
it
for
his
intellectual
support
and
his
dread
of
being
left
to
himself
is
like
the
horror
of
a
vacuum
he
can
only
breathe
a
learned
atmosphere
as
other
men
breathe
common
air
he
is
a
borrower
of
sense
he
has
no
ideas
of
his
own
and
must
live
on
those
of
other
people
the
habit
of
supplying
our
ideas
from
foreign
sources
all
internal
strength
of
thought
as
a
course
of
destroys
the
tone
of
the
stomach
the
faculties
of
the
mind
when
not
exerted
or
when
cramped
by
custom
and
authority
become
listless
torpid
and
unfit
for
the
purposes
of
thought
or
action
can
we
wonder
at
the
languor
and
lassitude
which
is
thus
produced
by
a
life
of
learned
sloth
and
ignorance
by
poring
over
lines
and
syllables
that
excite
little
more
idea
or
interest
than
if
they
were
the
characters
of
an
unknown
tongue
till
the
eye
closes
on
vacancy
and
the
book
drops
from
the
feeble
hand
i
would
rather
be
a
or
the
meanest
hind
that
all
day
in
the
eye
of
phoebus
and
at
night
sleeps
in
elysium
than
wear
out
my
life
so
dreaming
and
awake
the
learned
author
differs
from
the
learned
student
in
this
that
the
one
transcribes
what
the
other
reads
the
learned
are
mere
literary
drudges
if
you
set
them
upon
original
composition
their
heads
turn
they
do
know
where
they
are
the
indefatigable
readers
of
books
are
like
the
everlasting
copiers
of
pictures
who
when
they
attempt
to
do
anything
of
their
own
find
they
want
an
eye
quick
enough
a
hand
steady
enough
and
colours
bright
enough
to
trace
the
living
forms
of
nature
any
one
who
has
passed
through
the
regular
gradations
of
a
classical
education
and
is
not
made
a
fool
by
it
may
consider
himself
as
having
had
a
very
narrow
escape
it
is
an
old
remark
that
boys
who
shine
at
school
do
not
make
the
greatest
figure
when
they
grow
up
and
come
out
into
the
world
the
things
in
fact
which
a
boy
is
set
to
learn
at
school
and
on
which
his
success
depends
are
things
which
do
not
require
the
exercise
either
of
the
highest
or
the
most
useful
faculties
of
the
mind
memory
and
that
of
the
lowest
kind
is
the
chief
faculty
called
into
play
in
conning
over
and
repeating
lessons
by
rote
in
grammar
in
languages
in
geography
arithmetic
so
that
he
who
has
the
most
of
this
technical
memory
with
the
least
turn
for
other
things
which
have
a
stronger
and
more
natural
claim
upon
his
childish
attention
will
make
the
most
forward
the
jargon
containing
the
definitions
of
the
parts
of
speech
the
rules
for
casting
up
an
account
or
the
inflections
of
a
greek
verb
can
have
no
attraction
to
the
tyro
of
ten
years
old
except
as
they
are
imposed
as
a
task
upon
him
by
others
or
from
his
feeling
the
want
of
sufficient
relish
of
amusement
in
other
things
a
lad
with
a
sickly
constitution
and
no
very
active
mind
who
can
just
retain
what
is
pointed
out
to
him
and
has
neither
sagacity
to
distinguish
nor
spirit
to
enjoy
for
himself
will
generally
be
at
the
head
of
his
form
an
idler
at
school
on
the
other
hand
is
one
who
has
high
health
and
spirits
who
has
the
free
use
of
his
limbs
with
all
his
wits
about
him
who
feels
the
circulation
of
his
blood
and
the
motion
of
his
heart
who
is
ready
to
laugh
and
cry
in
a
breath
and
who
had
rather
chase
a
ball
or
a
butterfly
feel
the
open
air
in
his
face
look
at
the
fields
or
the
sky
follow
a
winding
path
or
enter
with
eagerness
into
all
the
little
conflicts
and
interests
of
his
acquaintances
and
friends
than
doze
over
a
musty
repeat
barbarous
distichs
after
his
master
sit
so
many
hours
pinioned
to
a
and
receive
his
reward
for
the
loss
of
time
and
pleasure
in
paltry
at
christmas
and
midsummer
there
is
indeed
a
degree
of
stupidity
which
prevents
children
from
learning
the
usual
lessons
or
ever
arriving
at
these
puny
academic
honours
but
what
passes
for
stupidity
is
much
oftener
a
want
of
interest
of
a
sufficient
motive
to
fix
the
attention
and
force
a
reluctant
application
to
the
dry
and
unmeaning
pursuits
of
the
best
capacities
are
as
much
above
this
drudgery
as
the
dullest
are
beneath
it
our
men
of
the
greatest
genius
have
not
been
most
distinguished
for
their
acquirements
at
school
or
at
the
university
th
enthusiast
fancy
was
a
truant
ever
gray
and
collins
were
among
the
instances
of
this
wayward
disposition
such
persons
do
not
think
so
highly
of
the
advantages
nor
can
they
submit
their
imaginations
so
servilely
to
the
trammels
of
strict
scholastic
discipline
there
is
a
certain
kind
and
degree
of
intellect
in
which
words
take
root
but
into
which
things
have
not
power
to
penetrate
a
mediocrity
of
talent
with
a
certain
slenderness
of
moral
constitution
is
the
soil
that
produces
the
most
brilliant
specimens
of
successful
and
greek
epigrammatists
it
should
not
be
forgotten
that
the
least
respectable
character
among
modern
politicians
was
the
cleverest
boy
at
eton
learning
is
the
knowledge
of
that
which
is
not
generally
known
to
others
and
which
we
can
only
derive
at
from
books
or
other
artificial
sources
the
knowledge
of
that
which
is
before
us
or
about
us
which
appeals
to
our
experience
passions
and
pursuits
to
the
bosoms
and
businesses
of
men
is
not
learning
learning
is
the
knowledge
of
that
which
none
but
the
learned
know
he
is
the
most
learned
man
who
knows
the
most
of
what
is
farthest
removed
from
common
life
and
actual
observation
that
is
of
the
least
practical
utility
and
least
liable
to
be
brought
to
the
test
of
experience
and
that
having
been
handed
down
through
the
greatest
number
of
intermediate
stages
is
the
most
full
of
uncertainty
difficulties
and
contradictions
it
is
seeing
with
the
eyes
of
others
hearing
with
their
ears
and
pinning
our
faith
on
their
understandings
the
learned
man
prides
himself
in
the
knowledge
of
names
and
dates
not
of
men
or
things
he
thinks
and
cares
nothing
about
his
neighbours
but
he
is
deeply
read
in
the
tribes
and
castes
of
the
hindoos
and
calmue
tartars
he
can
hardly
find
his
way
into
the
next
street
though
he
is
acquainted
with
the
exact
dimensions
of
constantinople
and
pekin
he
does
not
know
whether
his
oldest
acquaintance
is
a
knave
or
a
fool
but
he
can
pronounce
a
pompous
lecture
on
all
the
principal
characters
in
history
he
can
not
tell
whether
an
object
is
black
or
white
round
or
square
and
yet
he
is
a
professed
master
of
the
laws
of
optics
and
the
rules
of
perspective
he
knows
as
much
of
what
he
talks
about
as
a
blind
man
does
of
colours
he
can
not
give
a
satisfactory
answer
to
the
plainest
question
nor
is
he
ever
in
the
right
in
any
one
of
his
opinions
upon
any
one
matter
of
fact
that
really
comes
before
him
and
yet
he
gives
himself
out
for
an
infallible
judge
on
all
these
points
of
which
it
is
impossible
that
he
or
any
other
person
living
should
know
anything
but
by
conjecture
he
is
expert
in
all
the
dead
and
in
most
of
the
living
languages
but
he
can
neither
speak
his
own
fluently
nor
write
it
correctly
a
person
of
this
class
the
second
greek
scholar
of
his
day
undertook
to
point
out
several
solecisms
in
milton
latin
style
and
in
his
own
performance
there
is
hardly
a
sentence
of
common
english
such
was
such
is
such
was
not
porson
he
was
an
exception
that
confirmed
the
general
rule
a
man
that
by
uniting
talents
and
knowledge
with
learning
made
the
distinction
between
them
more
striking
and
palpable
a
mere
scholar
who
knows
nothing
but
books
must
be
ignorant
even
of
them
do
not
teach
the
use
of
books
how
should
he
know
anything
of
a
work
who
knows
nothing
of
the
subject
of
it
the
learned
pedant
is
conversant
with
books
only
as
they
are
made
of
other
books
and
those
again
of
others
without
end
he
parrots
those
who
have
parroted
others
he
can
translate
the
same
word
into
ten
different
languages
but
he
knows
nothing
of
the
which
it
means
in
any
one
of
them
he
stuffs
his
head
with
authorities
built
on
authorities
with
quotations
quoted
from
quotations
while
he
locks
up
his
senses
his
understanding
and
his
heart
he
is
unacquainted
with
the
maxims
and
manners
of
the
world
he
is
to
seek
in
the
characters
of
individuals
he
sees
no
beauty
in
the
face
of
nature
or
of
art
to
him
mighty
world
of
eye
and
ear
is
hid
and
except
at
one
entrance
shut
out
his
pride
takes
part
with
his
ignorance
and
his
rises
with
the
number
of
things
of
which
he
does
not
know
the
value
and
which
he
therefore
despises
as
unworthy
of
his
notice
he
knows
nothing
of
pictures
the
colouring
of
titian
the
grace
of
raphael
the
purity
of
domenichino
the
of
correggio
the
learning
of
poussin
the
airs
of
guido
the
taste
of
the
caracci
or
the
grand
contour
of
michael
angelo
of
all
those
glories
of
the
italian
and
miracles
of
the
flemish
school
which
have
filled
the
eyes
of
mankind
with
delight
and
to
the
study
and
imitation
of
which
thousands
have
in
vain
devoted
their
lives
these
are
to
him
as
if
they
had
never
been
a
mere
dead
letter
a
and
no
wonder
for
he
neither
sees
nor
understands
their
prototypes
in
nature
a
print
of
or
claude
enchanted
castle
may
be
hanging
on
the
walls
of
his
room
for
months
without
his
once
perceiving
them
and
if
you
point
them
out
to
him
he
will
turn
away
from
them
the
language
of
nature
or
of
art
which
is
another
nature
is
one
that
he
does
not
understand
he
repeats
indeed
the
names
of
apelles
and
phidias
because
they
are
to
be
found
in
classic
authors
and
boasts
of
their
works
as
prodigies
because
they
no
longer
exist
or
when
he
sees
the
finest
remains
of
grecian
art
actually
before
him
in
the
elgin
marbles
takes
no
other
interest
in
them
than
as
they
lead
to
a
learned
dispute
and
which
is
the
same
thing
a
quarrel
about
the
meaning
of
a
greek
particle
he
is
equally
ignorant
of
music
he
no
touch
of
it
from
the
strains
of
the
mozart
to
the
shepherd
pipe
upon
the
mountain
his
ears
are
nailed
to
his
books
and
deadened
with
the
sound
of
the
greek
and
latin
tongues
and
the
din
and
smithery
of
does
he
know
anything
more
of
poetry
he
knows
the
number
of
feet
in
a
verse
and
of
acts
in
a
play
but
of
the
soul
or
spirit
he
knows
nothing
he
can
turn
a
greek
ode
into
english
or
a
latin
epigram
into
greek
verse
but
whether
either
is
worth
the
trouble
he
leaves
to
the
critics
does
he
understand
act
and
practique
part
of
life
better
than
theorique
no
he
knows
no
liberal
or
mechanic
art
no
trade
or
occupation
no
game
of
skill
or
chance
learning
no
skill
in
surgery
in
agriculture
in
building
in
working
in
wood
or
in
iron
it
can
not
make
any
instrument
of
labour
or
use
it
when
made
it
can
not
handle
the
plough
or
the
spade
or
the
chisel
or
the
hammer
it
knows
nothing
of
hunting
or
hawking
fishing
or
shooting
of
horses
or
dogs
of
fencing
or
dancing
or
or
bowls
or
cards
or
tennis
or
anything
else
the
learned
professor
of
all
arts
and
sciences
can
not
reduce
any
one
of
them
to
practice
though
he
may
contribute
an
account
of
them
to
an
encyclopedia
he
has
not
the
use
of
his
hands
nor
of
his
feet
he
can
neither
run
nor
walk
nor
swim
and
he
considers
all
those
who
actually
understand
and
can
exercise
any
of
these
arts
of
body
or
mind
as
vulgar
and
mechanical
men
though
to
know
almost
any
one
of
them
in
perfection
requires
long
time
and
practice
with
powers
originally
fitted
and
a
turn
of
mind
particularly
devoted
to
them
it
does
not
require
more
than
this
to
enable
the
learned
candidate
to
arrive
by
painful
study
at
a
degree
and
a
fellowship
and
to
eat
drink
and
sleep
the
rest
of
his
life
the
thing
is
plain
all
that
men
really
understand
is
confined
to
a
very
small
compass
to
their
daily
affairs
and
experience
to
what
they
have
an
opportunity
to
know
and
motives
to
study
or
practise
the
rest
is
affectation
and
imposture
the
common
people
have
the
use
of
their
limbs
for
they
live
by
their
labour
or
skill
they
understand
their
own
business
and
the
characters
of
those
they
have
to
deal
with
for
it
is
necessary
that
they
should
they
have
eloquence
to
express
their
passions
and
wit
at
will
to
express
their
contempt
and
provoke
laughter
their
natural
use
of
speech
is
not
hung
up
in
monumental
mockery
in
an
obsolete
language
nor
is
their
sense
of
what
is
ludicrous
or
readiness
at
finding
out
allusions
to
express
it
buried
in
collections
of
you
will
hear
more
good
things
on
the
outside
of
a
from
london
to
oxford
than
if
you
were
to
pass
a
twelvemonth
with
the
undergraduates
or
heads
of
colleges
of
that
famous
university
and
more
truths
are
to
be
learnt
from
listening
to
a
noisy
debate
in
an
alehouse
than
from
attending
a
formal
one
in
the
house
of
commons
an
elderly
country
gentlewoman
will
often
know
more
of
character
and
be
able
to
illustrate
it
by
more
amusing
anecdotes
taken
from
the
history
of
what
has
been
said
done
and
gossiped
in
a
country
town
for
the
last
fifty
years
than
the
best
bluestocking
of
the
age
will
be
able
to
glean
from
that
sort
of
learning
which
consists
in
an
acquaintance
with
all
the
novels
and
satirical
poems
published
in
the
same
period
people
in
towns
indeed
are
woefully
deficient
in
a
knowledge
of
character
which
they
see
only
the
not
as
a
people
in
the
country
not
only
know
all
that
has
happened

his

half
a
century
ago
the
learned
know
nothing
of
the
matter
either
in

or
country
above
all
the
mass
of
society
have
common
sense
which
the
learned
in

ages
want
the

in

they

for

they
are
wrong
when
they

the
celebrated
nonconformist
divine
baxter
was
almost
stoned
to
death
by
the
good
women
of
kidderminster
for
asserting
from
the
pulpit
that
was
paved
with
infants
skulls
but
by
the
force
of
argument
and
of
learned
quotations
from
the
fathers
the
reverend
preacher
at
length
prevailed
over
the
scruples
of
his
congregation
and
over
reason
and
humanity
such
is
the
use
which
has
been
made
of
human
learning
the
labourers
in
this
vineyard
seem
as
if
it
was
their
object
to
confound
all
common
sense
and
the
distinctions
of
good
and
evil
by
means
of
traditional
maxims
and
preconceived
notions
taken
upon
trust
and
increasing
in
absurdity
with
increase
of
age
they
pile
hypothesis
on
hypothesis
mountain
high
till
it
is
impossible
to
come
at
the
plain
truth
on
any
question
they
see
things
not
as
they
are
but
as
they
find
them
in
books
and
and
shut
their
apprehensions
up
in
order
that
they
may
discover
nothing
to
interfere
with
their
prejudices
or
convince
them
of
their
absurdity
it
might
be
supposed
that
the
height
of
human
wisdom
consisted
in
maintaining
contradictions
and
rendering
nonsense
sacred
there
is
no
dogma
however
fierce
or
foolish
to
which
these
persons
have
not
set
their
seals
and
tried
to
impose
on
the
understandings
of
their
followers
as
the
will
of
heaven
clothed
with
all
the
terrors
and
sanctions
of
religion
how
little
has
the
human
understanding
been
directed
to
find
out
the
true
and
useful
how
much
ingenuity
has
been
thrown
away
in
the
defence
of
creeds
and
systems
how
much
time
and
talents
have
been
wasted
in
theological
controversy
in
law
in
politics
in
verbal
criticism
in
judicial
astrology
and
in
finding
out
the
art
of
making
gold
what
actual
benefit
do
we
reap
from
the

of
a

equally
learned

unprofitable
labours
of
scaliger
cardan

how
many
grains
of

are
there
in
their
thousand
folio

what
would
the

lose
if
they
were
committed
to
the
flames
or
are
they
not
already
to
the

of
all
the
capulets
yet
all
these
were
oracles
in
their
time
and
would
have
scoffed
at
you
or
me
at
common
sense
and
human
nature
for
differing
with
them
it
is
our
turn
to
laugh
now
to
conclude
this
subject
the
most
sensible
people
to
be
met
with
in
society
are
men
of
business
and
of
the
world
who
argue
from
what
they
see
and
know
instead
of
spinning
cobweb
distinctions
of
what
things
ought
to
be
women
have
often
more
of
what
is
called
than
men
they
have
fewer
pretensions
are
less
implicated
in
theories
and
judge
of
objects
more
from
their
immediate
and
involuntary
impression
on
the
mind
and
therefore
more
truly
and
naturally
they
can
not
reason
wrong
for
they
do
not
reason
at
all
they
do
not
think
or
speak
by
rule
and
they
have
in
general
more
eloquence
and
wit
as
well
as
sense
on
that
account
by
their
wit
sense
and
eloquence
together
they
generally
contrive
to
govern
their
husbands
their
style
when
they
write
to
their
friends
not
for
the
booksellers
is
better
than
that
of
most
uneducated
people
have
most
exuberance
of
invention
and
the
greatest
freedom
from
prejudice
shakespear
was
evidently
an
uneducated
mind
both
in
the
freshness
of
his
imagination
and
in
the
variety
of
his
views
as
milton
was
scholastic
in
the
texture
both
of
his
thoughts
and
feelings
shakespear
had
not
been
accustomed
to
write
themes
at
school
in
favour
of
virtue
or
against
vice
to
this
we
owe
the
unaffected
but
healthy
tone
of
his
dramatic
morality
if
we
wish
to
know
the
force
of
human
genius
we
should
read
shakespear
if
we
wish
to
see
the
insignificance
of
human
learning
we
may
study

the
indian
jugglers
coming
forward
and
seating
himself
on
the
ground
in
his
white
dress
and
tightened
turban
the
chief
of
the
indian
jugglers
begins
with
tossing
up
two
brass
balls
which
is
what
any
of
us
could
do
and
concludes
with
keeping
up
four
at
the
same
time
which
is
what
none
of
us
could
do
to
save
our
lives
nor
if
we
were
to
take
our
whole
lives
to
do
it
in
is
it
then
a
trifling
power
we
see
at
work
or
is
it
not
something
next
to
miraculous
it
is
the
utmost
stretch
of
human
ingenuity
which
nothing
but
the
bending
the
faculties
of
body
and
mind
to
it
from
the
tenderest
infancy
with
incessant
ever
anxious
application
up
to
manhood
can
accomplish
or
make
even
a
slight
approach
to
man
thou
art
a
wonderful
animal
and
thy
ways
past
finding
out
thou
canst
do
strange
things
but
thou
turnest
them
to
little
account
to
conceive
of
this
effort
of
extraordinary
dexterity
distracts
the
imagination
and
makes
admiration
breathless
yet
it
costs
nothing
to
the
performer
any
more
than
if
it
were
a
mere
mechanical
deception
with
which
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
watch
and
laugh
at
the
astonishment
of
the
spectators
a
single
error
of
a
hairsbreadth
of
the
smallest
conceivable
portion
of
time
would
be
fatal
the
precision
of
the
movements
must
be
like
a
mathematical
truth
their
rapidity
is
like
lightning
to
catch
four
balls
in
succession
in
less
than
a
second
of
time
and
deliver
them
back
so
as
to
return
with
seeming
consciousness
to
the
hand
again
to
make
them
revolve
round
him
at
certain
intervals
like
the
planets
in
their
spheres
to
make
them
chase
one
another
like
sparkles
of
fire
or
shoot
up
like
flowers
or
meteors
to
throw
them
behind
his
back
and
twine
them
round
his
neck
like
ribbons
or
like
serpents
to
do
what
appears
an
impossibility
and
to
do
if
with
all
the
ease
the
grace
the
carelessness
imaginable
to
laugh
at
to
play
with
the
glittering
mockeries
to
follow
them
with
his
eye
as
if
he
could
fascinate
them
with
its
lambent
fire
or
as
if
he
had
only
to
see
that
they
kept
time
with
the
music
on
the
stage
there
is
something
in
all
this
which
he
who
does
not
admire
may
be
quite
sure
he
never
really
admired
anything
in
the
whole
course
of
his
life
it
is
skill
surmounting
difficulty
and
beauty
triumphing
over
skill
it
seems
as
if
the
difficulty
once
mastered
naturally
resolved
itself
into
ease
and
grace
and
as
if
to
be
overcome
at
all
it
must
be
overcome
without
an
effort
the
smallest
awkwardness
or
want
of
pliancy
or
would
stop
the
whole
process
it
is
the
work
of
witchcraft
and
yet
sport
for
children
some
of
the
other
feats
are
quite
as
curious
and
wonderful
such
as
the
balancing
the
artificial
tree
and
shooting
a
bird
from
each
branch
through
a
quill
though
none
of
them
have
the
elegance
or
facility
of
the
keeping
up
of
the
brass
balls
you
are
in
pain
for
the
result
and
glad
when
the
experiment
is
over
they
are
not
accompanied
with
the
same
unmixed
unchecked
delight
as
the
former
and
i
would
not
give
much
to
be
merely
astonished
without
being
pleased
at
the
game
time
as
to
the
swallowing
of
the
sword
the
police
ought
to
interfere
to
prevent
it
when
i
saw
the
indian
juggler
do
the
same
things
before
his
feet
were
bare
and
he
had
large
rings
on
the
toes
which
kept
turning
round
all
the
time
of
the
performance
as
if
they
moved
of
the
hearing
a
speech
in
parliament
drawled
or
stammered
out
by
the
honourable
member
or
the
noble
lord
the
ringing
the
changes
on
their
which
any
one
could
repeat
after
them
as
well
as
they
stirs
me
not
a
jot
shakes
not
my
good
opinion
of
myself
but
the
seeing
the
indian
jugglers
does
it
makes
me
ashamed
of
myself
i
ask
what
there
is
that
i
can
do
as
well
as
this
nothing
what
have
i
been
doing
all
my
life
have
i
been
idle
or
have
i
nothing
to
show
for
all
my
labour
and
pains
or
have
i
passed
my
time
in
pouring
words
like
water
into
empty
sieves
rolling
a
stone
up
a
hill
and
then
down
again
trying
to
prove
an
argument
in
the
teeth
of
facts
and
looking
for
causes
in
the
dark
and
not
finding
them
is
there
no
one
thing
in
which
i
can
challenge
competition
that
i
can
bring
as
an
instance
of
exact
perfection
in
which
others
can
not
find
a
flaw
the
utmost
i
can
pretend
to
is
to
write
a
description
of
what
this
fellow
can
do
i
can
write
a
book
so
can
many
others
who
have
not
even
learned
to
spell
what
abortions
are
these
essays
what
errors
what
transitions
what
crooked
reasons
what
lame
conclusions
how
little
is
made
out
and
that
little
how
ill
yet
they
are
the
best
i
can
do
i
endeavour
to
recollect
all
i
have
ever
observed
or
thought
upon
a
subject
and
to
express
it
as
nearly
as
i
can
instead
of
writing
on
four
subjects
at
a
time
it
is
as
much
as
i
can
manage
to
keep
the
thread
of
one
discourse
clear
and
unentangled
i
have
also
time
on
my
hands
to
correct
my
opinions
and
polish
my
periods
but
the
one
i
can
not
and
the
other
i
will
not
do
i
am
fond
of
arguing
yet
with
a
good
deal
of
pains
and
practice
it
is
often
as
much
as
i
can
do
to
beat
my
man
though
he
may
be
an
indifferent
hand
a
common
fencer
would
disarm
his
adversary
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
unless
he
were
a
professor
like
himself
a
stroke
of
wit
will
sometimes
produce
this
effect
but
there
is
no
such
power
or
superiority
in
sense
or
reas
hardly
know
the
professor
from
the
impudent
pretender
or
the
mere
clown
i
have
always
had
this
feeling
of
the
inefficacy
and
slow
progress
of
intellectual
compared
to
mechanical
excellence
and
it
has
always
made
me
somewhat
dissatisfied
it
is
a
great
many
years
since
i
saw
richer
the
famous
perform
at
sadler
wells
he
was
matchless
in
his
art
and
added
to
his
extraordinary
skill
exquisite
ease
and
unaffected
natural
grace
i
was
at
that
time
employed
in
copying
a
picture
of
sir
joshua
reynolds
and
it
put
me
out
of
conceit
with
it
how
ill
this
part
was
made
out
in
the
drawing
how
heavy
how
slovenly
this
other
was
painted
i
could
not
help
saying
to
myself
the
had
performed
his
task
in
this
manner
leaving
so
many
gaps
and
botches
in
his
work
he
would
have
broken
his
neck
long
ago
i
should
never
have
seen
that
vigorous
elasticity
of
nerve
and
precision
of
movement
is
it
then
so
easy
an
undertaking
comparatively
to
dance
on
a
let
any
one
who
thinks
so
get
up
and
try
there
is
the
thing
it
is
that
which
at
first
we
can
not
do
at
all
which
in
the
end
is
done
to
such
perfection
to
account
for
this
in
some
degree
i
might
observe
that
mechanical
dexterity
is
confined
to
doing
some
one
particular
thing
which
you
can
repeat
as
often
as
you
please
in
which
you
know
whether
you
succeed
or
fail
and
where
the
point
of
perfection
consists
in
succeeding
in
a
given
in
mechanical
efforts
you
improve
by
perpetual
practice
and
you
do
so
infallibly
because
the
object
to
be
attained
is
not
a
matter
of
taste
or
fancy
or
opinion
but
of
actual
experiment
in
which
you
must
either
do
the
thing
or
not
do
it
if
a
man
is
put
to
aim
at
a
mark
with
a
bow
and
arrow
he
must
hit
it
or
miss
it
that
certain
he
can
not
deceive
himself
and
go
on
shooting
wide
or
falling
short
and
still
fancy
that
he
is
making
progress
no
distinction
between
right
and
wrong
between
true
and
false
is
here
palpable
and
he
must
either
correct
his
aim
or
persevere
in
his
error
with
his
eyes
open
for
which
there
is
neither
excuse
nor
temptation
if
a
man
is
learning
to
dance
on
a
rope
if
he
does
not
mind
what
he
is
about
he
will
break
his
neck
after
that
it
will
be
in
vain
for
him
to
argue
that
he
did
not
make
a
false
step
his
situation
is
not
like
that
of
goldsmith
pedagogue
in
argument
they
own
his
wondrous
skill
and
though
vanquish
he
could
argue
still
danger
is
a
good
teacher
and
makes
apt
scholars
so
are
disgrace
defeat
exposure
to
immediate
scorn
and
laughter
there
is
no
opportunity
in
such
cases
for
no
idling
time
away
no
being
off
your
guard
or
you
must
take
the
consequences
neither
is
there
any
room
for
humour
or
caprice
or
prejudice
if
the
indian
juggler
were
to
play
tricks
in
throwing
up
the
three
which
keep
their
positions
like
the
leaves
of
a
crocus
in
the
air
he
would
cut
his
fingers
i
can
make
a
very
bad
antithesis
without
cutting
my
fingers
the
tact
of
style
is
more
ambiguous
than
that
of
instruments
if
the
juggler
were
told
that
by
flinging
himself
under
the
wheels
of
the
juggernaut
when
the
idol
issues
forth
on
a
gaudy
day
he
would
immediately
be
transported
into
paradise
he
might
believe
it
and
nobody
could
disprove
it
so
the
brahmins
may
say
what
they
please
on
that
subject
may
build
up
dogmas
and
mysteries
without
end
and
not
be
detected
but
their
ingenious
countryman
can
not
persuade
the
frequenters
of
the
olympic
theatre
that
he
performs
a
number
of
astonishing
feats
without
actually
giving
proofs
of
what
he
there
is
then
in
this
sort
of
manual
dexterity
first
a
gradual
aptitude
acquired
to
a
given
exertion
of
muscular
power
from
constant
repetition
and
in
the
next
place
an
exact
knowledge
how
much
is
still
wanting
and
necessary
to
be
supplied
the
obvious
test
is
to
increase
the
effort
or
nicety
of
the
operation
and
still
to
find
it
come
true
the
muscles
ply
instinctively
to
the
dictates
of
habit
certain
movements
and
impressions
of
the
hand
and
eye
having
been
repeated
together
an
infinite
number
of
times
are
unconsciously
but
unavoidable
cemented
into
closer
and
closer
union
the
limbs
require
little
more
than
to
be
put
in
motion
for
them
to
follow
a
regular
track
with
ease
and
certainty
so
that
the
mere
intention
of
the
will
acts
mathematically
like
touching
the
spring
of
a
machine
and
you
come
with
locksley
in
in
shooting
at
a
mark
allow
for
the
wind
further
what
is
meant
by
perfection
in
mechanical
exercises
is
the
performing
certain
feats
to
a
uniform
nicety
that
is
in
fact
undertaking
no
more
than
you
can
perform
you
task
yourself
the
limit
you
fix
is
optional
and
no
more
than
human
industry
and
skill
can
attain
to
but
you
have
no
abstract
independent
standard
of
difficulty
or
excellence
other
than
the
extent
of
your
own
powers
thus
he
who
can
keep
up
four
brass
balls
does
this
but
he
can
not
keep
up
five
at
the
same
instant
and
would
fail
every
time
he
attempted
it
that
is
the
mechanical
performer
undertakes
to
emulate
himself
not
to
equal
another
but
the
artist
undertakes
to
imitate
another
or
to
do
what
nature
has
done
and
this
it
appears
is
more
difficult
viz
to
copy
what
she
has
set
before
us
in
the
face
of
nature
or
face
divine
entire
and
without
a
blemish
than
to
keep
up
four
brass
balls
at
the
same
instant
for
the
one
is
done
by
the
power
of
human
skill
and
industry
and
the
other
never
was
nor
will
be
upon
the
whole
therefore
i
have
more
respect
for
reynolds
than
i
have
for
richer
for
happen
how
it
will
there
have
been
more
people
in
the
world
who
could
dance
on
a
rope
like
the
one
than
who
could
paint
like
sir
joshua
the
latter
was
but
a
bungler
in
his
profession
to
the
other
it
is
true
but
then
he
had
a
harder
taskmaster
to
obey
whose
will
was
more
wayward
and
obscure
and
whose
instructions
it
was
more
difficult
to
practise
you
can
put
a
child
apprentice
to
a
tumbler
or
with
a
comfortable
prospect
of
success
if
they
are
but
sound
of
wind
and
limb
but
you
can
not
do
the
same
thing
in
painting
the
odds
are
a
million
to
one
you
may
make
indeed
as
many
haydons
and
h
s
as
you
put
into
that
sort
of
machine
but
not
one
reynolds
amongst
them
all
with
his
grace
his
grandeur
his
blandness
of
gusto
tones
and
gestures
hit
unless
you
could
make
the
man
over
again
to
snatch
this
grace
beyond
the
reach
of
art
is
then
the
height
of
art
where
fine
art
begins
and
where
mechanical
skill
ends
the
soft
suffusion
of
the
soul
the
speechless
breathing
eloquence
the
looks
with
the
skies
the
forms
of
an
eternal
principle
that
which
is
seen
but
for
a
moment
but
dwells
in
the
heart
always
and
is
only
seized
as
it
passes
by
strong
and
secret
sympathy
must
be
taught
by
nature
and
genius
not
by
rules
or
study
it
is
suggested
by
feeling
not
by
laborious
microscopic
inspection
in
seeking
for
it
without
we
lose
the
harmonious
clue
to
it
within
and
in
aiming
to
grasp
the
substance
we
let
the
very
spirit
of
art
evaporate
in
a
word
the
objects
of
fine
art
are
not
the
objects
of
sight
but
as
these
last
are
the
objects
of
taste
and
imagination
that
is
as
they
appeal
to
the
sense
of
beauty
of
pleasure
and
of
power
in
the
human
breast
and
are
explained
by
that
finer
sense
and
revealed
in
their
inner
structure
to
the
eye
in
return
nature
is
also
a
language
objects
like
words
have
a
meaning
and
the
true
artist
is
the
interpreter
of
this
language
which
he
can
only
do
by
knowing
its
application
to
a
thousand
other
objects
in
a
thousand
other
situations
thus
the
eye
is
too
blind
a
guide
of
itself
to
distinguish
between
the
warm
or
cold
tone
of
a
sky
but
another
sense
acts
as
a
monitor
to
it
and
does
not
err
the
colour
of
the
leaves
in
autumn
would
be
nothing
without
the
feeling
that
accompanies
it
but
it
is
that
feeling
that
stamps
them
on
the
canvas
faded
seared
blighted
shrinking
from
the
winter
flaw
and
makes
the
sight
as
true
as
touch
and
visions
as
poetic
eyes
avow
cling
to
each
leaf
and
hang
on
every
bough
the
more
ethereal
evanescent
more
refined
and
sublime
part
of
art
is
the
seeing
nature
through
the
medium
of
sentiment
and
passion
as
each
object
is
a
symbol
of
the
affections
and
a
link
in
the
chain
of
our
endless
being
but
the
unravelling
this
mysterious
web
of
thought
and
feeling
is
alone
in
the
muse
gift
namely
in
the
power
of
that
trembling
sensibility
which
is
awake
to
every
change
and
every
modification
of
its
impressions
that
thrills
in
each
nerve
and
lives
along
the
line
this
power
is
indifferently
called
genius
imagination
feeling
taste
but
the
manner
in
which
it
acts
upon
the
mind
can
neither
be
defined
by
abstract
rules
as
is
the
case
in
science
nor
verified
by
continual
unvarying
experiments
as
is
the
case
in
mechanical
performances
the
mechanical
excellence
of
the
dutch
painters
in
colouring
and
handling
is
that
which
comes
the
nearest
in
fine
art
to
the
perfection
of
certain
manual
exhibitions
of
skill
the
truth
of
the
effect
and
the
facility
with
which
it
is
produced
are
equally
admirable
up
to
a
certain
point
everything
is
faultless
the
hand
and
eye
have
done
their
part
there
is
only
a
want
of
taste
and
genius
it
is
after
we
enter
upon
that
enchanted
ground
that
the
human
mind
begins
to
droop
and
flag
as
in
a
strange
road
or
in
a
thick
mist
benighted
and
making
little
way
with
many
attempts
and
many
failures
and
that
the
best
of
us
only
escape
with
half
a
triumph
the
undefined
and
the
imaginary
are
the
regions
that
we
must
pass
like
satan
difficult
and
doubtful
flying
half
on
foot
the
object
in
sense
is
a
positive
thing
and
execution
comes
with
practice
cleverness
is
a
certain
or
aptitude
at
doing
certain
things
which
depend
more
on
a
particular
adroitness
and
readiness
than
on
force
or
perseverance
such
as
making
puns
making
epigrams
making
extempore
verses
mimicking
the
company
mimicking
a
style
etc
cleverness
is
either
liveliness
and
smartness
or
something
answering
to
of
like
letting
a
glass
fall
sideways
off
a
table
or
else
a
trick
like
knowing
the
secret
spring
of
a
watch
accomplishments
are
certain
external
graces
which
are
to
be
learned
from
others
and
which
are
easily
displayed
to
the
admiration
of
the
beholder
viz
dancing
riding
fencing
music
and
so
on
these
ornamental
acquirements
are
only
proper
to
those
who
are
at
ease
in
mind
and
fortune
i
know
an
individual
who
if
he
had
been
born
to
an
estate
of
five
thousand
a
year
would
have
been
the
most
accomplished
gentleman
of
the
age
he
would
have
been
the
delight
and
envy
of
the
circle
in
which
he
moved
would
have
graced
by
his
manners
the
liberality
flowing
from
the
openness
of
his
heart
would
have
laughed
with
the
women
have
argued
with
the
men
have
said
good
things
and
written
agreeable
ones
have
taken
a
hand
at
piquet
or
the
lead
at
the
harpsichord
and
have
set
and
sung
his
own
verses
nugae
canorae
with
tenderness
and
spirit
a
rochester
without
the
vice
a
modern
surrey
as
it
is
all
these
capabilities
of
excellence
stand
in
his
way
he
is
too
versatile
for
a
professional
man
not
dull
enough
for
a
political
drudge
too
gay
to
be
happy
too
thoughtless
to
be
rich
he
wants
the
enthusiasm
of
the
poet
the
severity
of
the
and
the
application
of
the
man
of
business
talent
differs
from
genius
as
voluntary
differs
from
involuntary
power
ingenuity
is
genius
in
trifles
greatness
is
genius
in
undertakings
of
much
pith
and
moment
a
clever
or
ingenious
man
is
one
who
can
do
anything
well
whether
it
is
worth
doing
or
not
a
great
man
is
one
who
can
do
that
which
when
done
is
of
the
highest
importance
make
of
a
small
city
a
great
one
this
gives
one
a
pretty
good
idea
of
the
distinction
in
question
greatness
is
great
power
producing
great
effects
it
is
not
enough
that
a
man
has
great
power
in
himself
he
must
show
it
to
all
the
world
in
a
way
that
can
not
be
hid
or
gainsaid
he
must
fill
up
a
certain
idea
in
the
public
mind
i
have
no
other
notion
of
greatness
than
this
twofold
definition
great
results
springing
from
great
inherent
energy
the
great
in
visible
objects
has
relation
to
that
which
extends
over
space
the
great
in
mental
ones
has
to
do
with
space
and
time
no
man
is
truly
great
who
is
great
only
in
his
lifetime
the
test
of
greatness
is
the
page
of
history
nothing
can
be
said
to
be
great
that
has
a
distinct
limit
or
that
borders
on
something
evidently
greater
than
itself
besides
what
is
and
pampered
into
mere
notoriety
is
of
a
gross
and
vulgar
quality
in
itself
a
lord
mayor
is
hardly
a
great
man
a
city
orator
or
patriot
of
the
day
only
show
by
reaching
the
height
of
their
wishes
the
distance
they
are
at
from
any
true
ambition
popularity
is
neither
fame
nor
greatness
a
king
as
such
is
not
a
great
man
he
has
great
power
but
it
is
not
his
own
he
merely
wields
the
lever
of
the
state
which
a
child
an
idiot
or
a
madman
can
do
it
is
the
office
not
the
man
we
gaze
at
any
one
else
in
the
same
situation
would
be
just
as
much
an
object
of
abject
curiosity
we
laugh
at
the
country
girl
who
having
seen
a
king
expressed
her
disappointment
by
saying
he
is
only
a
man
yet
knowing
this
we
run
to
see
a
king
as
if
he
was
something
more
than
a
to
display
the
greatest
powers
unless
they
are
applied
to
great
purposes
makes
nothing
for
the
character
of
greatness
to
throw
a
barleycorn
through
the
eye
of
a
needle
to
multiply
nine
figures
by
nine
in
the
memory
argues
definite
dexterity
of
body
and
capacity
of
mind
but
nothing
comes
of
either
there
is
a
surprising
power
at
work
but
the
effects
are
not
proportionate
or
such
as
take
hold
of
the
imagination
to
impress
the
idea
of
power
on
others
they
must
be
made
in
some
way
to
feel
it
it
must
be
communicated
to
their
understandings
in
the
shape
of
an
increase
of
knowledge
or
it
must
subdue
and
overawe
them
by
subjecting
their
wills
admiration
to
be
solid
and
lasting
must
be
founded
on
proofs
from
which
we
have
no
means
of
escaping
it
is
neither
a
slight
nor
a
voluntary
gift
a
mathematician
who
solves
a
profound
problem
a
poet
who
creates
an
image
of
beauty
in
the
mind
that
was
not
there
before
imparts
knowledge
and
power
to
others
in
which
his
greatness
and
his
fame
consists
and
on
which
it
reposes
jedediah
buxton
will
be
forgotten
but
napier
bones
will
live
lawgivers
philosophers
founders
of
religion
conquerors
and
heroes
inventors
and
great
geniuses
in
arts
and
sciences
are
great
men
for
they
are
great
public
benefactors
or
formidable
scourges
to
mankind
among
ourselves
shakespear
newton
bacon
milton
cromwell
were
great
men
for
they
showed
great
power
by
acts
and
thoughts
that
have
not
yet
been
consigned
to
oblivion
they
must
needs
be
men
of
lofty
stature
whose
shadows
lengthen
out
to
remote
posterity
a
great
may
be
a
great
man
for
moliere
was
but
a
great
in
my
mind
the
author
of
was
a
great
man
so
have
there
been
many
others
a
great
is
not
a
great
man
for
he
leaves
the
world
as
he
found
it
no
act
terminating
in
itself
constitutes
greatness
this
will
apply
to
all
displays
of
power
or
trials
of
skill
which
are
confined
to
the
momentary
individual
effort
and
construct
no
permanent
image
or
trophy
of
themselves
without
them
is
not
an
actor
then
a
great
man
because
dies
and
leaves
the
world
no
copy
i
must
make
an
exception
for
siddons
or
else
give
up
my
definition
of
greatness
for
her
sake
a
man
at
the
top
of
his
profession
is
not
therefore
a
great
man
he
is
great
in
his
way
but
that
is
all
unless
he
shows
the
marks
of
a
great
moving
intellect
so
that
we
trace
the
and
can
sympathise
with
the
springs
that
urge
him
on
the
rest
is
but
a
craft
or
john
hunter
was
a
great
man
any
one
might
see
without
the
smallest
skill
in
surgery
his
style
and
manner
showed
the
man
he
would
set
about
cutting
up
the
carcass
of
a
whale
with
the
same
greatness
of
gusto
that
michael
angelo
would
have
hewn
a
block
of
marble
lord
nelson
was
a
great
naval
commander
but
for
myself
i
have
not
much
opinion
of
a
seafaring
life
sir
humphry
davy
is
a
great
chemist
but
i
am
not
sure
that
he
is
a
great
man
i
am
not
a
bit
the
wiser
for
any
of
his
discoveries
nor
i
never
met
with
any
one
that
was
but
it
is
in
the
nature
of
greatness
to
propagate
an
idea
of
itself
as
wave
impels
wave
circle
without
circle
it
is
a
contradiction
in
terms
for
a
coxcomb
to
be
a
great
man
a
really
great
man
has
always
an
idea
of
something
greater
than
himself
i
have
observed
that
certain
sectaries
and
polemical
writers
have
no
higher
compliment
to
pay
their
most
shining
lights
than
to
say
that
such
a
one
was
a
considerable
man
in
his
day
some
new
elucidation
of
a
text
sets
aside
the
authority
of
the
old
interpretation
and
a
great
scholar
memory
outlives
him
half
a
century
at
the
utmost
a
rich
man
is
not
a
great
man
except
to
his
dependents
and
his
steward
a
lord
is
a
great
man
in
the
idea
we
have
of
his
ancestry
and
probably
of
himself
if
we
know
nothing
of
him
but
his
title
i
have
heard
a
story
of
two
bishops
one
of
whom
said
speaking
of
peter
at
rome
that
when
he
first
entered
it
he
was
rather
but
that
as
he
walked
up
it
his
mind
seemed
to
swell
and
dilate
with
it
and
at
last
to
fill
the
whole
building
the
other
said
that
as
he
saw
more
of
it
he
appeared
to
himself
to
grow
less
and
less
every
step
he
took
and
in
the
end
to
dwindle
into
nothing
this
was
in
some
respects
a
striking
picture
of
a
great
and
little
mind
for
greatness
sympathises
with
greatness
and
littleness
shrinks
into
itself
the
one
might
have
become
a
wolsey
the
other
was
only
fit
to
become
a
mendicant
friar
or
there
might
have
been
court
reasons
for
making
him
a
bishop
the
french
have
to
me
a
character
of
littleness
in
all
about
them
but
they
have
produced
three
great
men
that
belong
to
every
country
moliere
rabelais
and
montaigne
to
return
from
this
digression
and
conclude
essay
a
singular
instance
of
manual
dexterity
was
shown
in
the
person
of
the
late
john
cavanaugh
whom
i
have
several
times
seen
his
death
was
celebrated
at
the
time
in
an
article
in
the
newspaper
written
apparently
between
jest
and
earnest
but
as
it
is
to
our
purpose
and
falls
in
with
my
own
way
of
considering
such
subjects
i
shall
here
take
leave
to
quote
it
at
his
house
in
burbage
street
giles
john
cavanagh
the
famous
hand
when
a
person
dies
who
does
any
one
thing
better
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
which
so
many
others
are
trying
to
do
well
it
leaves
a
gap
in
society
it
is
not
likely
that
any
one
will
now
see
the
game
of
fives
played
in
its
perfection
for
many
years
to
come
for
cavanagh
is
dead
and
has
not
left
his
peer
behind
him
it
may
be
said
that
there
are
things
of
more
importance
than
striking
a
ball
against
a
wall
there
are
things
indeed
that
make
more
noise
and
do
as
little
good
such
as
making
war
and
peace
making
speeches
and
answering
them
making
verses
and
blotting
them
making
money
and
throwing
it
away
but
the
game
of
fives
is
what
no
one
despises
who
has
ever
played
at
it
it
is
the
finest
exercise
for
the
body
and
the
best
relaxation
for
the
mind
the
roman
poet
said
that
care
mounted
behind
the
horseman
and
stuck
to
his
skirts
but
this
remark
would
not
have
applied
to
the
he
who
takes
to
playing
at
fives
is
twice
young
he
feels
neither
the
past
nor
future
in
the
instant
debts
taxes
domestic
treason
foreign
levy
nothing
can
touch
him
further
he
has
no
other
wish
no
other
thought
from
the
moment
the
game
begins
but
that
of
striking
the
ball
of
placing
it
of
it
this
cavanagh
was
sure
to
do
whenever
he
touched
the
ball
there
was
an
end
of
the
chase
his
eye
was
certain
his
hand
fatal
his
presence
of
mind
complete
he
could
do
what
he
pleased
and
he
always
knew
exactly
what
to
do
he
saw
the
whole
game
and
played
it
took
instant
advantage
of
his
adversary
weakness
and
recovered
balls
as
if
by
a
miracle
and
from
sudden
thought
that
every
one
gave
for
lost
he
had
equal
power
and
skill
quickness
and
judgment
he
could
either
outwit
his
antagonist
by
finesse
or
beat
him
by
main
strength
sometimes
when
he
seemed
preparing
to
send
the
ball
with
the
full
swing
of
his
arm
he
would
by
a
slight
turn
of
his
wrist
drop
it
within
an
inch
of
the
line
in
general
the
ball
came
from
his
hand
as
if
from
a
racket
in
a
straight
horizontal
line
so
that
it
was
in
vain
to
attempt
to
overtake
or
stop
it
as
it
was
said
of
a
great
orator
that
he
never
was
at
a
loss
for
a
word
and
for
the
properest
word
so
cavanagh
always
could
tell
the
degree
of
force
necessary
to
be
given
to
a
ball
and
the
precise
direction
in
which
it
should
be
sent
he
did
his
work
with
the
greatest
ease
never
took
more
pains
than
was
necessary
and
while
others
were
fagging
themselves
to
death
was
as
cool
and
collected
as
if
he
had
just
entered
the
court
his
style
of
play
was
as
remarkable
as
his
power
of
execution
he
had
no
affectation
no
trifling
he
did
not
throw
away
the
game
to
show
off
an
attitude
or
try
an
experiment
he
was
a
fine
sensible
manly
player
who
did
what
he
could
but
that
was
more
than
any
one
else
could
even
affect
to
do
his
blows
were
not
undecided
and
ineffectual
lumbering
like
wordsworth
epic
poetry
nor
wavering
like
coleridge
lyric
prose
nor
short
of
the
mark
like
brougham
speeches
nor
wide
of
it
like
canning
wit
nor
foul
like
the
nor
balls
like
the
cobbett
and
junius
together
would
have
made
a
cavanagh
he
was
the
best
player
in
the
world
even
when
his
adversary
was
fourteen
he
would
play
on
the
same
or
better
and
as
he
never
flung
away
the
game
through
carelessness
and
conceit
he
never
gave
it
through
laziness
or
want
of
heart
the
only
peculiarity
of
his
play
was
that
he
never
but
let
the
balls
hop
but
if
they
rose
an
inch
from
the
ground
he
never
missed
having
them
there
was
not
only
nobody
equal
but
nobody
second
to
him
it
is
supposed
that
he
could
give
any
other
player
half
the
game
or
beat
him
with
his
left
hand
his
service
was
tremendous
he
once
played
woodward
and
meredith
together
two
of
the
best
players
in
england
in
the
martin
street
and
made
seven
and
twenty
aces
following
by
services
alone
a
thing
unheard
of
he
another
time
played
peru
who
was
considered
a
a
match
of
the
best
out
of
five
games
and
in
the
three
first
games
which
of
course
decided
the
match
peru
got
only
one
ace
cavanagh
was
an
irishman
by
birth
and
a
by
profession
he
had
once
laid
aside
his
and
walked
up
in
his
smartest
clothes
to
the
rosemary
branch
to
have
an
afternoon
pleasure
a
person
accosted
him
and
asked
him
if
he
would
have
a
game
so
they
agreed
to
play
for
half
a
crown
a
game
and
a
bottle
of
cider
the
first
game
began
it
was
seven
eight
ten
thirteen
fourteen
all
cavanagh
won
it
the
next
was
the
same
they
played
on
and
each
game
was
hardly
contested
there
said
the
unconscious
there
was
a
stroke
that
cavanagh
could
not
take
i
never
played
better
in
my
life
and
yet
i
ca
win
a
game
i
do
know
how
it
is
however
they
played
on
cavanagh
winning
every
game
and
the
bystanders
drinking
the
cider
and
laughing
all
the
time
in
the
twelfth
game
when
cavanagh
was
only
four
and
the
stranger
thirteen
a
person
came
in
and
said
what
are
you
here
cavanagh
the
words
were
no
sooner
pronounced
than
the
astonished
player
let
the
hall
drop
from
his
hand
and
saying
what
have
i
been
breaking
my
heart
all
this
time
to
beat
cavanagh
refused
to
make
another
effort
and
yet
i
give
you
my
word
said
cavanagh
telling
the
story
with
some
triumph
i
played
all
the
while
with
my
clenched
fist
he
used
frequently
to
ploy
matches
at
copenhagen
house
for
wagers
and
dinners
the
wall
against
which
they
play
is
the
same
that
supports
the
and
when
the
wall
resounded
louder
than
usual
the
cooks
exclaimed
those
are
the
irishman
balls
and
the
joints
trembled
on
the
spit
goldsmith
consoled
himself
that
there
were
places
where
he
too
was
admired
and
cavanagh
was
the
admiration
of
all
the
where
he
ever
played
powell
when
he
played
matches
in
the
court
in
martin
street
used
to
fill
his
gallery
at
half
a
crown
a
head
with
amateurs
and
admirers
of
talent
in
whatever
department
it
is
shown
he
could
not
have
shown
himself
in
any
ground
in
england
but
he
would
have
been
immediately
surrounded
with
inquisitive
gazers
trying
to
find
out
in
what
part
of
his
frame
his
unrivalled
skill
lay
as
politicians
wonder
to
see
the
balance
of
europe
suspended
in
lord
castlereagh
face
and
admire
the
trophies
of
the
british
navy
lurking
under
croker
hanging
brow
now
cavanagh
was
as
a
man
as
the
noble
lord
and
much
better
looking
than
the
right
hon
secretary
he
had
a
clear
open
countenance
and
did
not
look
sideways
or
down
like
murray
the
bookseller
he
was
a
young
fellow
of
sense
humour
and
courage
he
once
had
a
quarrel
with
a
waterman
at
hungerford
stairs
and
they
say
served
him
out
in
great
style
in
a
word
there
are
hundreds
at
this
day
who
can
not
mention
his
name
without
admiration
as
the
best
that
perhaps
ever
lived
the
greatest
excellence
of
which
they
have
any
notion
and
the
noisy
shout
of
the
ring
happily
stood
him
in
stead
of
the
unheard
voice
of
posterity
the
only
person
who
seems
to
have
excelled
as
much
in
another
way
as
cavanagh
did
in
his
was
the
late
john
davies
the
it
was
remarked
of
him
that
he
did
not
seem
to
follow
the
ball
but
the
ball
seemed
to
follow
him
give
him
a
foot
of
wall
and
he
was
sure
to
make
the
ball
the
four
best
of
that
day
were
jack
spines
jem
harding
armitage
and
church
davies
could
give
any
one
of
these
two
hands
a
time
that
is
half
the
game
and
each
of
these
at
their
best
could
give
the
best
player
now
in
london
the
same
odds
such
are
the
gradations
in
all
exertions
of
human
skill
and
art
he
once
played
four
capital
players
together
and
beat
them
he
was
also
a
and
an
excellent
in
the
fleet
or
king
bench
he
would
have
stood
against
powell
who
was
reckoned
the
best
player
of
his
time
this
player
is
at
present
the
keeper
of
the
and
we
might
recommend
to
him
for
a
motto
over
his
door
who
enters
here
forgets
himself
his
country
and
his
friends
and
the
best
of
it
is
that
by
the
calculation
of
the
odds
none
of
the
three
are
worth
remembering
cavanagh
died
from
the
bursting
of
a
which
prevented
him
from
playing
for
the
last
two
or
three
years
this
he
was
often
heard
to
say
he
thought
hard
upon
him
he
was
fast
recovering
however
when
he
was
suddenly
carried
off
to
the
regret
of
all
who
knew
him
as
peel
made
it
a
qualification
of
the
present
speaker
mr
manners
sutton
that
he
was
an
excellent
moral
character
so
jack
cavanagh
was
a
zealous
catholic
and
could
not
be
persuaded
to
eat
meat
on
a
friday
the
day
on
which
he
died
we
have
paid
this
willing
tribute
to
his
memory
let
no
rude
hand
deface
it
and
his
forlorn
notes
to
essay
ix
the
celebrated
peter
pindar
wolcot
first
discovered
and
brought
out
the
talents
of
the
late
opie
the
painter
he
was
a
poor
cornish
boy
and
was
out
at
work
in
the
fields
when
the
poet
went
in
search
of
him
my
lad
can
you
go
and
bring
me
your
very
best
picture
the
other
flew
like
lightning
and
soon
came
back
with
what
he
considered
as
his
masterpiece
the
stranger
looked
at
it
and
the
young
artist
after
waiting
for
some
time
without
his
giving
any
opinion
at
length
exclaimed
eagerly
what
do
you
think
of
it
of
it
said
wolcot
i
think
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
it
that
you
who
might
do
so
well
do
no
better
the
same
answer
would
have
applied
to
this
artist
latest
performances
that
had
been
suggested
by
one
of
his
earliest
efforts
if
two
persons
play
against
each
other
at
any
game
one
of
them
necessarily
fails

on

unfriended
melancholy
slow

the
lazy

or
wandering
po
i
never
was
in
a
better
place
or
humour
than
i
am
at
present
for
writing
on
this
subject
i
have
a
partridge
getting
ready
for
my
supper
my
fire
is
blazing
on
the
hearth
the
air
is
mild
for
the
season
of
the
year
i
have
had
but
a
slight
fit
of
indigestion
the
only
thing
that
makes
me
abhor
myself
i
have
three
hours
good
before
me
and
therefore
i
will
attempt
it
it
is
as
well
to
do
it
at
once
as
to
have
it
to
do
for
a
week
to
come
if
the
writing
on
this
subject
is
no
easy
task
the
thing
itself
is
a
harder
one
it
asks
a
troublesome
effort
to
ensure
the
admiration
of
others
it
is
a
still
greater
one
to
be
satisfied
with
one
own
thoughts
as
i
look
from
the
window
at
the
wide
bare
heath
before
me
and
through
the
misty
moonlight
air
see
the
woods
that
wave
over
the
top
of
winterslow
while
is
blind
with
sleet
my
mind
takes
its
flight
through
too
long
a
series
of
years
supported
only
by
the
patience
of
thought
and
secret
yearnings
after
truth
and
good
for
me
to
be
at
a
loss
to
understand
the
feeling
i
intend
to
write
about
but
i
do
not
know
that
this
will
enable
me
to
convey
it
more
agreeably
to
the
reader
lady
grandison
in
a
letter
to
miss
harriet
byron
assures
her
that
brother
sir
charles
lived
and
lady
soon
after
for
richardson
was
never
tired
of
a
good
thing
repeats
the
same
observation
to
which
miss
byron
frequently
returns
in
her
answers
to
both
sisters
you
know
sir
charles
lives
to
himself
till
at
length
it
passes
into
a
proverb
among
the
fair
correspondents
this
is
not
however
an
example
of
what
i
understand
by
to
for
sir
charles
grandison
was
indeed
always
thinking
of
himself
but
by
this
phrase
i
mean
never
thinking
at
all
about
any
more
than
if
there
was
no
such
person
in
existence
the
character
i
speak
of
is
as
little
of
an
egotist
as
possible
richardson
great
favourite
was
as
much
of
one
as
possible
some
satirical
critic
has
represented
him
in
elysium
over
the
hand
of
lady
grandison
miss
byron
that
was
he
ought
to
have
been
represented
bowing
over
his
own
hand
for
he
never
admired
any
one
but
himself
and
was
the
god
of
his
own
neither
do
i
call
it
living
to
to
retire
into
a
desert
like
the
saints
and
martyrs
of
old
to
be
devoured
by
wild
beasts
nor
to
descend
into
a
cave
to
be
considered
as
a
hermit
nor
to
got
to
the
top
of
a
pillar
or
rock
to
do
fanatic
penance
and
be
seen
of
all
men
what
i
mean
by
living
to
is
living
in
the
world
as
in
it
not
of
it
it
is
as
if
no
one
know
there
was
such
a
person
and
you
wished
no
one
to
know
it
it
is
to
be
a
silent
spectator
of
the
mighty
scene
of
things
not
an
object
of
attention
or
curiosity
in
it
to
take
a
thoughtful
anxious
interest
in
what
is
passing
in
the
world
but
not
to
feel
the
slightest
inclination
to
make
or
meddle
with
it
it
is
such
a
life
as
a
pure
spirit
might
be
supposed
to
lead
and
such
an
interest
as
it
might
take
in
the
affairs
of
men
calm
contemplative
passive
distant
touched
with
pity
for
their
sorrows
smiling
at
their
follies
without
bitterness
sharing
their
affections
but
not
troubled
by
their
passions
not
seeking
their
notice
nor
once
dreamt
of
by
them
he
who
lives
wisely
to
himself
and
to
his
own
heart
looks
at
the
busy
world
through
the
of
retreat
and
does
not
want
to
mingle
in
the
fray
hears
the
tumult
and
is
still
he
is
not
able
to
mend
it
nor
willing
to
mar
it
he
sees
enough
in
the
universe
to
interest
him
without
putting
himself
forward
to
try
what
he
can
do
to
fix
the
eyes
of
the
universe
upon
him
vain
the
attempt
he
reads
the
clouds
he
looks
at
the
stars
he
watches
the
return
of
the
seasons
the
falling
leaves
of
autumn
the
perfumed
breath
of
spring
starts
with
delight
at
the
note
of
a
thrush
in
a
copse
near
him
sits
by
the
fire
listens
to
the
moaning
of
the
wind
pores
upon
a
book
or
discourses
the
freezing
hours
away
or
melts
down
hours
to
minutes
in
pleasing
thought
all
this
while
he
is
taken
up
with
other
things
forgetting
himself
he
relishes
an
author
style
without
thinking
of
turning
author
he
is
fond
of
looking
at
a
print
from
an
old
picture
in
the
room
without
teasing
himself
to
copy
it
he
does
not
fret
himself
to
death
with
trying
to
be
what
he
is
not
or
to
do
what
he
can
not
he
hardly
knows
what
he
is
capable
of
and
is
not
in
the
least
concerned
whether
he
shall
ever
make
a
figure
in
the
world
he
feels
the
truth
of
the
lines
the
man
whose
eye
is
ever
on
himself
doth
look
one
the
least
of
nature
works
one
who
might
move
the
wise
man
to
that
scorn
which
wisdom
holds
unlawful
ever
he
looks
out
of
himself
at
the
wide
extended
prospect
of
nature
and
takes
an
interest
beyond
his
narrow
pretensions
in
general
humanity
he
is
free
as
air
and
independent
as
the
wind
woe
be
to
him
when
he
first
begins
to
think
what
others
say
of
him
while
a
man
is
contented
with
himself
and
his
own
resources
all
is
well
when
he
undertakes
to
play
a
part
on
the
stage
and
to
persuade
the
world
to
think
more
about
him
than
they
do
about
themselves
he
is
got
into
a
track
where
he
will
find
nothing
but
briars
and
thorns
vexation
and
disappointment
i
can
speak
a
little
to
this
point
for
many
years
of
my
life
i
did
nothing
but
think
i
had
nothing
else
to
do
but
solve
some
knotty
point
or
dip
in
some
abstruse
author
or
look
at
the
sky
or
wander
by
the
pebbled
seaside
to
see
the
children
sporting
on
the
shore
and
hear
the
mighty
waters
rolling
evermore
i
cared
for
nothing
i
wanted
nothing
i
took
my
time
to
consider
whatever
occurred
to
me
and
was
in
no
hurry
to
give
a
sophistical
answer
to
a
question
there
was
no
printer
devil
waiting
for
me
i
used
to
write
a
page
or
two
perhaps
in
half
a
year
and
remember
laughing
heartily
at
the
celebrated
experimentalist
nicholson
who
told
me
that
in
twenty
years
he
had
written
as
much
as
would
make
three
hundred
octavo
volumes
if
i
was
not
a
great
author
i
could
read
with
ever
fresh
delight
ending
still
beginning
and
had
no
occasion
to
write
a
criticism
when
i
had
done
if
i
could
not
paint
like
claude
i
could
admire
witchery
of
the
soft
blue
sky
as
i
walked
out
and
was
satisfied
with
the
pleasure
it
gave
me
if
i
was
dull
it
gave
me
little
concern
if
i
was
lively
i
indulged
my
spirits
i
wished
well
to
the
world
and
believed
as
favourably
of
it
as
i
could
i
was
like
a
stranger
in
a
foreign
land
at
which
i
looked
with
wonder
curiosity
and
delight
without
expecting
to
be
an
object
of
attention
in
return
i
had
no
relations
to
the
state
no
duty
to
perform
no
ties
to
bind
me
to
others
i
had
neither
friend
nor
mistress
wife
nor
child
i
lived
in
a
world
of
contemplation
and
not
of
action
this
sort
of
dreaming
existence
is
the
best
he
who
quits
it
to
go
in
search
of
realities
generally
barters
repose
for
repeated
disappointments
and
vain
regrets
his
time
thoughts
and
feelings
are
no
longer
at
his
own
disposal
from
that
instant
he
does
not
survey
the
objects
of
nature
as
they
are
in
themselves
but
looks
asquint
at
them
to
see
whether
he
can
not
make
them
the
instruments
of
his
ambition
interest
or
pleasure
for
a
candid
undesigning
undisguised
simplicity
of
character
his
views
become
jaundiced
sinister
and
double
he
takes
no
farther
interest
in
the
great
changes
of
the
world
but
as
he
has
a
paltry
share
in
producing
them
instead
of
opening
his
senses
his
understanding
and
his
heart
to
the
resplendent
fabric
of
the
universe
he
holds
a
crooked
mirror
before
his
face
in
which
he
may
admire
his
own
person
and
pretensions
and
just
glance
his
eye
aside
to
see
whether
others
are
not
admiring
him
too
he
no
more
exists
in
the
impression
which
fair
variety
of
things
makes
upon
him
softened
and
subdued
by
habitual
contemplation
but
in
the
feverish
sense
of
his
own
upstart
by
aiming
to
fix
he
is
become
the
slave
of
opinion
he
is
a
tool
a
part
of
a
machine
that
never
stands
still
and
is
sick
and
giddy
with
the
ceaseless
motion
he
has
no
satisfaction
but
in
the
reflection
of
his
own
image
in
the
public
gaze
but
in
the
repetition
of
his
own
name
in
the
public
ear
he
himself
is
mixed
up
with
and
spoils
everything

buonaparte
was
not
tired
of
the
stuck
all
over
the
louvre
and
throughout
france
goldsmith
as
we
all
know
when
in
holland
went
out
into
a
balcony
with
some
handsome
englishwomen
and
on
their
being
applauded
by
the
spectators
turned
round
and
said
peevishly
are
places
where
i
also
am
admired
he
could
not
give
the
craving
appetite
of
an
author
vanity
one
day
respite
i
have
seen
a
celebrated
talker
of
our
own
time
turn
pale
and
go
out
of
the
room
when
a
girl
has
come
into
it
who
for
a
moment
divided
the
attention
of
his
infinite
are
the
mortifications
of
the
bare
attempt
to
emerge
from
obscurity
numberless
the
failures
and
greater
and
more
galling
still
the
vicissitudes
and
tormenting
accompaniments
of
success
whose
top
to
climb
is
certain
falling
or
so
slippery
that
the
fear
as
bad
as
falling
to
god
exclaimed
oliver
cromwell
when
he
was
at
any
time
thwarted
by
the
parliament
i
had
remained
by
my
woodside
to
tend
a
flock
of
sheep
rather
than
have
been
thrust
on
such
a
government
as
this
when
buonaparte
got
into
his
carriage
to
proceed
on
his
russian
expedition
carelessly
twirling
his
glove
and
singing
the
air
to
the
war
is
going
he
did
not
think
of
the
tumble
he
has
got
since
the
shock
of
which
no
one
could
have
stood
but
himself
we
see
and
hear
chiefly
of
the
favourites
of
fortune
and
the
muse
of
great
generals
of
actors
of
celebrated
poets
these
are
at
the
head
we
are
struck
with
the
glittering
eminence
on
which
they
stand
and
long
to
set
out
on
the
same
tempting
career
not
thinking
how
many
discontented
lieutenants
are
in
vain
seeking
promotion
all
their
lives
and
obliged
to
put
up
with
insolence
of
office
and
the
spurns
which
patient
merit
of
the
unworthy
takes
how
many
strolling
players
are
doomed
to
penury
and
tattered
robes
in
country
places
dreaming
to
the
last
of
a
london
engagement
how
many
wretched
daubers
shiver
and
shake
in
the
of
alternate
hopes
and
fears
waste
and
pine
away
in
the
atrophy
of
genius
or
else
turn
or
how
many
hapless
poets
have
sighed
out
their
souls
to
the
muse
in
vain
without
ever
getting
their
effusions
farther
known
than
the
poet
corner
of
a
country
newspaper
and
looked
and
looked
with
grudging
wistful
eyes
at
the
envious
horizon
that
bounded
their
provincial
fame
suppose
an
actor
for
instance
the
and
the
thousand
natural
pangs
that
flesh
is
heir
to
get
at
the
top
of
his
profession
he
can
no
longer
bear
a
rival
near
the
throne
to
be
second
or
only
equal
to
another
is
to
be
nothing
he
starts
at
the
prospect
of
a
successor
and
retains
the
mimic
sceptre
with
a
convulsive
grasp
perhaps
as
he
is
about
to
seize
the
first
place
which
he
has
long
had
in
his
eye
an
unsuspected
competitor
steps
in
before
him
and
carries
off
the
prize
leaving
him
to
commence
his
irksome
toil
again
he
is
in
a
state
of
alarm
at
every
appearance
or
rumour
of
the
appearance
of
a
new
actor
mouse
that
takes
up
its
lodgings
in
a
cat
ear
has
a
mansion
of
peace
to
him
he
dreads
every
hint
of
an
objection
and
least
of
all
can
forgive
praise
mingled
with
censure
to
doubt
is
to
insult
to
discriminate
is
to
degrade
he
dare
hardly
look
into
a
criticism
unless
some
one
has
tasted
it
for
him
to
see
that
there
is
no
offence
in
it
if
he
does
not
draw
crowded
houses
every
night
he
can
neither
eat
nor
sleep
or
if
all
these
terrible
inflections
are
removed
and
he
can
his
meal
in
peace
he
then
becomes
surfeited
with
applause
and
dissatisfied
with
his
profession
he
wants
to
be
something
else
to
be
distinguished
as
an
author
a
collector
a
classical
scholar
a
man
of
sense
and
information
and
weighs
every
word
he
utters
and
half
retracts
it
before
he
utters
it
lest
if
he
were
to
make
the
smallest
slip
of
the
tongue
it
should
get
buzzed
abroad
that
was
only
clever
as
an
actor
if
ever
there
was
a
man
who
did
not
derive
more
pain
than
pleasure
from
his
vanity
that
man
says
rousseau
was
no
other
than
a
fool
a
country
gentleman
near
taunton
spent
his
whole
life
in
making
some
hundreds
of
wretched
copies
of
pictures
which
were
bought
up
at

death

by
the
apothecary
of

in
an
who
on
asking
his
landlady
as
to
his
way
of
life
was
told
that
the
poor
gentleman
was
very
quiet
and
gave
little
trouble
that
he
generally
had
a
plate
of
mashed
potatoes
for
his
dinner
and
lay
in
bed
most
of
his
time
repeating
his
part
a
young
couple

way
amiable
and
deserving
were
to
have
been
married
and
a
was
bespoke
by
the
officers
of

the
expense
of

license
and
of
the
but
the
profits
of
the
night
did
not
amount
to
the
necessary
sum
and
they
have
i
fear
it
since
oh
for
the
pencil
of
hogarth
or
wilkie
to
give
a
view
of
the
comic
strength
of
the
company
at
drawn
up
in
in
the
marriage
with
a
of
the
pit
boxes
and
gallery
to
cure
for
ever
the
love
of
the
and
the
desire
to
shine
and
make
holiday
in
the
eyes
of
others
instead
of
retiring
within
ourselves
and
keeping
our
wishes
and
our
thoughts
at
home
even
in
the
common
affairs
of
life
in
love
friendship
and
marriage
how
little
security
have
we
when
we
trust
our
happiness
in
the
hands
of
others
most
of
the
friends
i
have
seen
have
turned
out
the
bitterest
enemies
or
cold
uncomfortable
acquaintance
old
companions
are
like
meats
served
up
too
often
that
lose
their
relish
and
their
wholesomeness
he
who
looks
at
beauty
to
admire
to
adore
it
who
reads
of
its
wondrous
power
in
novels
in
poems
or
in
plays
is
not
unwise
but
let
no
man
fall
in
love
for
from
that
moment
he
is
baby
of
a
girl
i
like
very
well
to
repeat
such
lines
as
these
in
the
play
of
with
what
a
waving
air
she
goes
along
the
corridor
how
like
a
fawn
yet
statelier
hark
no
sound
however
soft
nor
gentlest
echo
telleth
when
she
treads
but
every
motion
of
her
shape
doth
seem
hallowed
by
silence
but
however
beautiful
the
description
defend
me
from
meeting
with
the
original
the
fly
that
sips
treacle
is
lost
in
the
sweets
so
he
that
tastes
woman
ruin
meets
the
song
is
gay
not
mine
and
a
it
is
how
few
out
of
the
infinite
number
of
those
that
marry
and
are
given
in
marriage
wed
with
those
they
would
prefer
to
all
the
world
nay
how
far
the
greater
proportion
are
joined
together
by
mere
motives
of
convenience
accident
recommendation
of
friends
or
indeed
not
unfrequently
by
the
very
fear
of
the
event
by
repugnance
and
a
sort
of
fatal
fascination
yet
the
tie
is
for
life
not
to
be
shaken
off
but
with
disgrace
or
death
a
man
no
longer
lives
to
himself
but
is
a
body
as
well
as
mind
chained
to
another
in
spite
of
himself
like

and
death

disproportion

milton
perhaps
from

vehemence

out

but
such
as
some
misfortune
brings
him
or

or

seldom
gain
through
her
perverseness
but
shall
sea

far

and
to
a
fell
adversary
his
hate
and
shame
which
infinite
calamity
shall
cause
to
human
life
and
household
peace
confound
if
love
at
first
sight
were
mutual
or
to
be
conciliated
by
kind
offices
if
the
fondest
affection
were
not
so
often
repaid
and
chilled
by
indifference
and
scorn
if
so
many
lovers
both
before
and
since
the
madman
in
don
quixote
had
not
a
statue
hunted
the
wind
cried
aloud
to
the
desert
if
friendship
were
lasting
if
merit
were
renown
and
renown
were
health
riches
and
long
life
or
if
the
homage
of
the
world
were
paid
to
conscious
worth
and
the
true
aspirations
after
excellence
instead
of
its
gaudy
signs
and
outward
trappings
then
indeed
i
might
be
of
opinion
that
it
is
better
to
live
to
others
than
but
as
the
case
stands
i
incline
to
the
negative
side
of
the
question
i
have
not
loved
the
world
nor
the
world
me
i
have
not
flattered
its
rank
breath
nor
to
its
idolatries
a
patient
knee
nor
coin
my
cheek
to
smiles
nor
cried
aloud
in
worship
of
an
echo
in
the
crowd
they
could
not
deem
me
one
of
such
i
stood
among
them
but
not
of
them
in
a
shroud
of
thoughts
which
were
not
their
thoughts
and
still
could
had
i
not
filled
my
mind
which
thus
itself
subdued
i
have
not
loved
the
world
nor
the
world
me
but
let
us
part
fair
foes
i
do
believe
though
i
have
found
them
not
that
there
may
be
words
which
are
things
hopes
which
will
not
deceive
and
virtues
which
are
merciful
nor
weave
snares
for
the
failing
i
would
also
deem
others
griefs
that
some
sincerely
grieve
that
two
or
one
are
almost
what
they
seem
that
goodness
is
no
name
and
happiness
no
dream
sweet
verse
embalms
the
spirit
of
sour
misanthropy
but
woe
betide
the
ignoble
who
should
thus
dare
to
compare
notes
with
the
world
or
tax
it
roundly
with
imposture
if
i
had
sufficient
provocation
to
rail
at
the
public
as
ben
jonson
did
at
the
audience
in
the
prologues
to
his
plays
i
think
i
should
do
it
in
good
set
terms
nearly
as
follows
there
is
not
a
more
mean
stupid
dastardly
pitiful
selfish
spiteful
envious
ungrateful
animal
than
the
public
it
is
the
greatest
of
cowards
for
it
is
afraid
of
itself
from
its
unwieldy
overgrown
dimensions
it
dreads
the
least
opposition
to
it
and
shakes
like
isinglass
at
the
touch
of
a
finger
it
starts
at
its
own
shadow
like
the
man
in
the
hartz
mountains
and
trembles
at
the
mention
of
its
own
name
it
has
a
lion
mouth
the
heart
of
a
hare
with
ears
erect
and
sleepless
eyes
it
stands
its
fears
it
is
so
in
awe
of
its
own
opinion
that
it
never
dares
to
form
any
but
catches
up
the
first
idle
rumour
lest
it
should
be
behindhand
in
its
judgment
and
echoes
it
till
it
is
deafened
with
the
sound
of
its
own
voice
the
idea
of
what
the
public
will
think
prevents
the
public
from
ever
thinking
at
all
and
acts
as
a
spell
on
the
exercise
of
private
judgment
so
that
in
short
the
public
ear
is
at
the
mercy
of
the
first
impudent
pretender
who
chooses
to
fill
it
with
noisy
assertions
or
false
surmises
or
secret
whispers
what
is
said
by
one
is
heard
by
all
the
supposition
that
a
thing
is
known
to
all
the
world
makes
all
the
world
believe
it
and
the
hollow
repetition
of
a
vague
report
drowns
the
small
voice
of
reason
we
may
believe
or
know
that
what
is
said
is
not
true
but
we
know
or
fancy
that
others
believe
it
we
dare
not
contradict
or
are
too
indolent
to
dispute
with
them
and
therefore
give
up
our
internal
and
as
we
think
our
solitary
conviction
to
a
sound
without
substance
without
proof
and
often
without
meaning
nay
more
we
may
believe
and
know
not
only
that
a
thing
is
false
but
that
others
believe
and
know
it
to
be
so
that
they
are
quite
as
much
in
the
secret
of
the
imposture
as
we
are
that
they
see
the
puppets
at
work
the
nature
of
the
machinery
and
yet
if
any
one
has
the
art
or
power
to
get
the
management
of
it
he
shall
keep
possession
of
the
public
ear
by
virtue
of
a
cant
phrase
or
nickname
and
by
dint
of
effrontery
and
perseverance
make
all
the
world
believe
and
repeat
what
all
the
world
know
to
be
false
the
ear
is
quicker
than
the
judgment
we
know
that
certain
things
are
said
by
that
circumstance
alone
we
know
that
they
produce
a
certain
effect
on
the
imagination
of
others
and
we
conform
to
their
prejudices
by
mechanical
sympathy
and
for
want
of
sufficient
spirit
to
differ
with
them
so
far
then
is
public
opinion
from
resting
on
a
broad
and
solid
basis
as
the
aggregate
of
thought
and
feeling
in
a
community
that
it
is
slight
and
shallow
and
variable
to
the
last
degree
the
bubble
of
the
moment
so
that
we
may
safely
say
the
public
is
the
dupe
of
public
opinion
not
its
parent
the
public
is
pusillanimous
and
cowardly
because
it
is
weak
it
knows
itself
to
be
a
great
dunce
and
that
it
has
no
opinions
but
upon
suggestion
yet
it
is
unwilling
to
appear
in
and
would
have
it
thought
that
its
decisions
are
as
wise
as
they
are
weighty
it
is
hasty
in
taking
up
its
favourites
more
hasty
in
laying
them
aside
lest
it
should
be
supposed
deficient
in
sagacity
in
either
case
it
is
generally
divided
into
two
strong
parties
each
of
which
will
allow
neither
common
sense
nor
common
honesty
to
the
other
side
it
reads
the
and
and
believes
them
both
or
if
there
is
a
doubt
malice
turns
the
scale
taylor
and
hessey
told
me
that
they
had
sold
nearly
two
editions
of
the
of
shakespear
in
about
three
months
but
that
after
the
of
them
came
out
they
never
sold
another
copy
the
public
enlightened
as
they
are
must
have
known
the
meaning
of
that
attack
as
well
as
those
who
made
it
it
was
not
ignorance
then
but
cowardice
that
led
them
to
give
up
their
own
opinion
a
crew
of
mischievous
critics
at
edinburgh
having
affixed
the
epithet
of
the
to
one
or
two
writers
born
in
the
metropolis
all
the
people
in
london
became
afraid
of
looking
into
their
works
lest
they
too
should
be
convicted
of
cockneyism
oh
brave
public
this
epithet
proved
too
much
for
one
of
the
writers
in
question
and
stuck
like
a
barbed
arrow
in
his
heart
poor
keats
what
was
sport
to
the
town
was
death
to
him
young
sensitive
delicate
he
was
like
a
bud
bit
by
an
envious
worm
ere
he
could
spread
his
sweet
leaves
to

or
dedicate
his
beauty
to
the
sun
and
unable
to
endure
the
miscreant
cry
and
idiot
laugh
withdrew
to
sigh
his
last
breath
in
foreign
climes
the
public
is
as
envious
and
ungrateful
as
it
is
ignorant
stupid
and
a
monster
of
ingratitudes
it
reads
it
admires
it
extols
only
because
it
is
the
fashion
not
from
any
love
of
the
subject
or
the
man
it
cries
you
up
or
runs
you
down
out
of
mere
caprice
and
levity
if
you
have
pleased
it
it
is
jealous
of
its
own
involuntary
acknowledgment
of
merit
and
seizes
the
first
opportunity
the
first
shabby
pretext
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
you
and
be
quits
once
more
every
petty
caviller
is

into
a

every

every
little
low
paltry
creature
that
gaped
and
wondered
only
because
others
did
so
is
glad
to
find
you
as
he
thinks
on
a
level
with
himself
an
author
is
not
then
after
all
a
being
of
another
order
public
admiration
is
forced
and
goes
against
the
grain
public
obloquy
is
cordial
and
sincere
every
individual
feels
his
own
importance
in
it
they
give
you
up
bound
hand
and
foot
into
the
power
of
your
accusers
to
attempt
to
defend
yourself
is
a
high
crime
and
misdemeanor
a
contempt
of
court
an
extreme
piece
of
impertinence
or
if
you
prove
every
charge
unfounded
they
never
think
of
retracing
their
error
or
making
you
amends
it
would
be
a
compromise
of
their
dignity
they
consider
themselves
as
the
party
injured
and
resent
your
innocence
as
an
imputation
on
their
judgment
the

doddington

are

all
those

a

into

posterity
is
no
better
not
a

more
enlightened
or
more
liberal
except
that
you
are
no
longer
in
their
power
and
that
the
voice
of
common
fame
saves
them
the
trouble
of
deciding
on
your
claims
the
public
now
are
the
posterity
of
milton
and
shakespear
our
posterity
will
be
the
living
public
of
a
future
generation
when
a
man
is
dead
they
put
money
in
his
coffin
erect
monuments
to
his
memory
and
celebrate
the
anniversary
of
his
birthday
in
set
speeches
would
they
take
any
notice
of
him
if
he
were
living
no
i
was
complaining
of
this
to
a
scotchman
who
had
been
attending
a
dinner
and
a
subscription
to
raise
a
monument
to
burns
he
replied
he
would
sooner
subscribe
twenty
pounds
to
his
monument
than
have
given
it
him
while
living
so
that
if
the
poet
were
to
come
to
life
again
he
would
treat
him
just
as
he
was
treated
in
fact
this
was
an
honest
scotchman
what
said

rest
would
do
enough

corner

might
carry
with
me
as
a
consolation
the
passage
in
on

in

colours
the
resources
which
a
man
may
always
find
within
himself

of
which
the

those

abraham
tucker
relates
of
a
friend
of
his
an
old
special
pleader
that
once
coming
out
of
his
chambers
in
the
temple
with
him
to
take
a
walk
he
hesitated
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
which
way
to
go
proposed
different
directions
to
charing
cross
to
paul
found
some
objection
to
them
all
and
at
last
turned
back
for
want
of
a
casting
motive
to
incline
the
scale
tucker
gives
this
as
an
instance
of
professional
indecision
or
of
that
temper
of
mind
which
having
been
long
used
to
weigh
the
reasons
for
things
with
scrupulous
exactness
could
not
come
to
any
conclusion
at
all
on
the
spur
of
the
occasion
or
without
some
grave
distinction
to
justify
its
choice
louvet
in
his
narrative
tells
us
that
when
several
of
the
brisotin
party
were
collected
at
the
house
of
barbaroux
i
think
it
was
ready
to
effect
their
escape
from
the
power
of
robespierre
one
of
them
going
to
the
window
and
finding
a
shower
of
rain
coming
on
seriously
advised
their
stopping
till
the
next
morning
for
that
the
emissaries
of
government
would
not
think
of
coming
in
search
of
them
in
such
bad
weather
some
of
them
deliberated
on
this
wise
proposal
and
were
nearly
taken
such
is
the
effeminacy
of
the
speculative
and
philosophical
temperament
compared
with
the
promptness
and
vigour
of
the
practical
it
is
on
such
unequal
terms
that
the
refined
and
romantic
speculators
on
possible
good
and
evil
contend
with
their
remorseless
adversaries
and
we
see
the
result
reasoners
in
general
are
undecided
wavering
and
sceptical
or
yield
at
last
to
the
weakest
motive
as
most
congenial
to
their
feeble
habit
of
soul
some
men
are
mere
machines
they
are
put
in
a
of
business
and
are
harnessed
to
a
profession
yoked
to
fortune
wheels
they
plod
on
and
succeed
their
affairs
conduct
them
not
they
their
affairs
all
they
have
to
do
is
to
let
things
take
their
course
and
not
go
out
of
the
beaten
road
a
man
may
carry
on
the
business
of
farming
on
the
same
spot
and
principle
that
his
ancestors
have
done
for
many
generations
before
him
without
any
extraordinary
share
of
capacity
the
proof
is
it
is
done
every
day
in
every
county
and
parish
in
the
kingdom
all
that
is
necessary
is
that
he
should
not
pretend
to
be
wiser
than
his
neighbours
if
he
has
a
grain
more
wit
or
penetration
than
they
if
his
vanity
gets
the
start
of
his
avarice
only
half
a
neck
if
he
has
ever
thought
or
read
anything
upon
the
subject
it
will
most
probably
be
the
ruin
of
him
he
will
turn
theoretical
or
experimental
farmer
and
no
more
need
be
said
cobbett
who
is
a
sufficiently
shrewd
and
practical
man
with
an
eye
also
to
the
main
chance
had
got
some
notions
in
his
head
from
tull
about
the
method
of
sowing
turnips
to
which
he
would
have
sacrificed
not
only
his
estate
at
botley
but
his
native
county
of
hampshire
itself
sooner
than
give
up
an
inch
of
his
argument
will
you
baulk
a
man
in
the
career
of
his
humour
therefore
that
a
man
may
not
be
ruined
by
his
humours
he
should
be
too
dull
and
phlegmatic
to
have
any
he
must
have
figures
nor
no
fantasies
which
busy
thought
draws
in
the
brains
of
men
the
fact
is
that
the
ingenuity
or
judgment
of
no
one
man
is
equal
to
that
of
the
world
at
large
which
is
the
fruit
of
the
experience
and
ability
of
all
mankind
even
where
a
man
is
right
in
a
particular
notion
he
will
be
apt
to
overrate
the
importance
of
his
discovery
to
the
detriment
of
his
affairs
action
requires
but
in
general
if
you
set
your
face
against
custom
people
will
set
their
faces
against
you
they
can
not
tell
whether
you
are
right
or
wrong
but
they
know
that
you
are
guilty
of
a
pragmatical
assumption
of
superiority
over
them
which
they
do
not
like
there
is
no
doubt
that
if
a
person
two
hundred
years
ago
had
foreseen
and
attempted
to
put
in
practice
the
most
approved
and
successful
methods
of
cultivation
now
in
use
it
would
have
been
a
to
his
credit
and
fortune
so
that
though
the
experiments
and
improvements
of
private
individuals
from
time
to
time
gradually
go
to
enrich
the
public
stock
of
information
and
reform
the
general
practice
they
are
mostly
the
ruin
of
the
person
who
makes
them
because
he
takes
a
part
for
the
whole
and
lays
more
stress
upon
the
single
point
in
which
he
has
found
others
in
the
wrong
than
on
all
the
rest
in
which
they
are
substantially
and
prescriptively
in
the
right
the
great
requisite
it
should
appear
then
for
the
prosperous
management
of
ordinary
business
is
the
want
of
imagination
or
of
any
ideas
but
those
of
custom
and
interest
on
the
narrowest
scale
and
as
the
affairs
of
the
world
are
necessarily
carried
on
by
the
common
run
of
its
inhabitants
it
seems
a
wise
dispensation
of
providence
that
it
should
be
so
if
no
one
could
rent
a
piece
of
without
a
genius
for
mechanical
inventions
or
stand
behind
a
counter
without
a
large
benevolence
of
soul
what
would
become
of
the
commercial
and
agricultural
interests
of
this
great
and
once
flourishing
country
i
would
not
be
understood
as
saying
that
there
is
not
what
may
be
called
a
genius
for
business
an
extraordinary
capacity
for
affairs
quickness
and
comprehension
united
an
insight
into
character
an
acquaintance
with
a
number
of
particular
circumstances
a
variety
of
expedients
a
tact
for
finding
out
what
will
do
i
grant
all
this
in
liverpool
and
manchester
they
would
persuade
you
that
your
merchant
and
manufacturer
is
your
only
gentleman
and
scholar
but
still
making
every
allowance
for
the
difference
between
the
liberal
trader
and
the
sneaking
shopkeeper
i
doubt
whether
the
most
surprising
success
is
to
be
accounted
for
from
any
such
unusual
attainments
or
whether
a
making
half
a
million
of
money
is
a
proof
of
his
capacity
for
thought
in
general
it
is
much
oftener
owing
to
views
and
wishes
bounded
but
constantly
directed
to
one
particular
object
to
succeed
a
man
should
aim
only
at
success
the
child
of
fortune
should
resign
himself
into
the
hands
of
fortune
a
plotting
head
frequently
overreaches
itself
a
mind
confident
of
its
resources
and
calculating
powers
enters
on
critical
speculations
which
in
a
game
depending
so
much
on
chance
and
unforeseen
events
and
not
entirely
on
intellectual
skill
turn
the
odds
greatly
against
any
one
in
the
long
run
the
rule
of
business
is
to
take
what
you
can
get
and
keep
what
you
have
got
or
an
eagerness
in
seizing
every
opportunity
that
offers
for
promoting
your
own
interest
and
a
plodding
persevering
industry
in
making
the
most

you
have
already
obtained

effectual

as

machine
that
must
be
left
in
a
great
measure
to
turn
itself
the
most
that
a
man
can
do
is
to
stand
at
the
receipt
of
custom
and
be
constantly
on
the
lookout
for
windfalls
the
true
devotee
in
this
way
waits
for
the
revelations
of
fortune
as
the
poet
waits
for
the
inspiration
of
the
muse
and
does
not
rashly
anticipate
her
favours
he
must
be
neither
capricious
nor
wilful
i
have
known
people
untrammelled
in
the
ways
of
business
but
with
so
intense
an
apprehension
of
their
own
interest
that
they
would
grasp
at
the
slightest
possibility
of
gain
as
a
certainty
and
were
led
into
as
many
mistakes
by
an
overgriping
usurious
disposition
as
they
could
have
been
by
the
most
thoughtless
we
hear
a
great
outcry
about
the
want
of
judgment
in
men
of
genius
it
is
not
a
want
of
judgment
but
an
excess
of
other
things
they
err
knowingly
and
are
wilfully
blind
the
understanding
is
out
of
the
question
the
profound
judgment
which
soberer
people
pique
themselves
upon
is
in
truth
a
want
of
passion
and
imagination
give
them
an
interest
in
anything
a
sudden
fancy
a
bait
for
their
favourite
foible
and
who
so
besotted
as
they
stir
their
feelings
and
farewell
to
their
prudence
the
understanding
operates
as
a
motive
to
action
only
in
the
silence
of
the
passions
i
have
heard
people
of
a
sanguine
temperament
reproached
with
betting
according
to
their
wishes
instead
of
their
opinion
who
should
win
and
i
have
seen
those
who
reproached
them
do
the
very
same
thing
the
instant
their
own
vanity
or
prejudices
are
concerned
the
most
mechanical
people
once
thrown
off
their
balance
are
the
most
extravagant
and
fantastical
what
passion
is
there
so
unmeaning
and
irrational
as
avarice
itself
the
dutch
went
mad
for
tulips
and
for
love
to
return
to
what
was
said
a
little
way
back
a
question
might
be
started
whether
as
thought
relates
to
the
whole
circumference
of
things
and
interests
and
business
is
confined
to
a
very
small
part
of
them
viz
to
a
knowledge
of
a
own
affairs
and
the
making
of
his
own
fortune
whether
a
talent
for
the
latter
will
not
generally
exist
in
proportion
to
the
narrowness
and
grossness
of
his
ideas
nothing
drawing
his
attention
out
of
his
own
sphere
or
giving
him
an
interest
except
in
those
things
which
he
can
realise
and
bring
home
to
himself
in
the
most
undoubted
shape
to
the
man
of
business
all
the
world
is
a
fable
but
the
stock
exchange
to
the
nothing
has
a
real
existence
that
he
can
not
convert
into
a
tangible
feeling
that
he
does
not
recognise
as
property
that
he
can
not
with
a
rule
or
count
upon
ten
fingers
the
want
of
thought
of
imagination
drives
the
practical
man
upon
immediate
realities
to
the
poet
or
philosopher
all
is
real
and
interesting
that
is
true
or
possible
that
can
reach
in
its
consequences
to
others
or
be
made
a
subject
of
curious
speculation
to
himself
but
is
it
right
then
to
judge
of
action
by
the
quantity
of
thought
implied
in
it
any
more
than
it
would
be
to
condemn
a
life
of
contemplation
for
being
inactive
or
has
not
everything
a
source
and
principle
of
its
own
to
which
we
should
refer
it
and
not
to
the
principles
of
other
things
he
who
succeeds
in
any
pursuit
in
which
others
fail
may
be
presumed
to
have
qualities
of
some
sort
or
other
which
they
are
without
if
he
has
not
brilliant
wit
he
may
have
solid
sense
if
he
has
not
subtlety
of
understanding
he
may
have
energy
and
firmness
of
purpose
if
he
has
only
a
few
advantages
he
may
have
modesty
and
prudence
to
make
the
most
of
what
he
possesses
propriety
is
one
great
matter
in
the
conduct
of
life
which
though
like
a
graceful
carriage
of
the
body
it
is
neither
definable
nor
striking
at
first
sight
is
the
result
of
finely
balanced
feelings
and
lends
a
secret
strength
and
charm
to
the
whole
character
quicquid
agit
quoquo
vestigia
vertit
componit
furtim
subsequiturque
decor
there
are
more
ways
than
one
in
which
the
various
faculties
of
the
mind
may
unfold
themselves
neither
words
nor
ideas
reducible
to
words
constitute
the
utmost
limit
of
human
capacity
man
is
not
a
merely
talking
nor
a
merely
reasoning
animal
let
us
then
take
him
as
he
is
instead
of
him
of
nature
fair
proportions
to
suit
our
previous
notions
doubtless
there
are
great
characters
both
in
active
and
contemplative
life
there
have
been
heroes
as
well
as
sages
legislators
and
founders
of
religion
historians
and
able
statesmen
and
generals
inventors
of
useful
arts
and
instruments
and
explorers
of
undiscovered
countries
as
well
as
writers
and
readers
of
books
it
will
not
do
to
set
all
these
aside
under
any
fastidious
or
pedantic
distinction
comparisons
are
odious
because
they
are
impertinent
and
lead
only
to
the
discovery
of
defects
by
making
one
thing
the
standard
of
another
which
has
no
relation
to
it
if
as
some
one
proposed
we
were
to
institute
an
inquiry
was
the
greatest
man
milton
or
cromwell
buonaparte
or
rubens
we
should
have
all
the
authors
and
artists
on
one
side
and
all
the
military
men
and
the
whole
diplomatic
body
on
the
other
who
would
set
to
work
with
all
their
might
to
pull
in
pieces
the
idol
of
the
other
party
and
the
longer
the
dispute
continued
the
more
would
each
grow
dissatisfied
with
his
favourite
though
determined
to
allow
no
merit
to
any
one
else
the
mind
is
not
well
competent
to
take
in
the
full
impression
of
more
than
one
style
of
excellence
or
one
extraordinary
character
at
once
contradictory
claims
puzzle
and
stupefy
it
and
however
admirable
any
individual
may
be
in
himself
and
unrivalled
in
his
particular
way
yet
if
we
try
him
by
others
in
a
totally
opposite
class
that
is
if
we
consider
not
what
he
was
but
what
he
was
not
he
will
be
found
to
be
nothing
we
do
not
reckon
up
the
excellences
on
either
side
for
then
these
would
satisfy
the
mind
and
put
an
end
to
the
comparison
we
have
no
way
of
exclusively
setting
up
our
favourite
but
by
running
down
his
supposed
rival
and
for
the
gorgeous
hues
of
rubens
the
lofty
conceptions
of
milton
the
deep
policy
and
cautious
daring
of
cromwell
or
the
dazzling
exploits
and
fatal
ambition
of
the
modern
chieftain
the
poet
is
transformed
into
a
pedant
the
artist
sinks
into
a
mechanic
the
politician
turns
out
no
better
than
a
knave
and
the
hero
is
exalted
into
a
madman
it
is
as
easy
to
get
the
start
of
our
antagonist
in
argument
by
frivolous
and
vexatious
objections
to
one
side
of
the
question
as
it
is
difficult
to
do
full
and
heaped
justice
to
the
other
if
i
am
asked
which
is
the
greatest
of
those
who
have
been
the
greatest
in
different
ways
i
answer
the
one
that
we
happen
to
be
thinking
of
at
the
time
for
while
that
is
the
case
we
can
conceive
of
nothing
higher
if
there
is
a
propensity
in
the
vulgar
to
admire
the
achievements
of
personal
prowess
or
instances
of
fortunate
enterprise
too
much
it
can
not
be
denied
that
those
who
have
to
weigh
out
and
dispense
the
meed
of
fame
in
books
have
been
too
much
disposed
by
a
natural
bias
to
confine
all
merit
and
talent
to
the
productions
of
the
pen
or
at
least
to
those
works
which
being
artificial
or
abstract
representations
of
things
are
transmitted
to
posterity
and
cried
up
as
models
in
their
kind
this
though
unavoidable
is
hardly
just
actions
pass
away
and
are
forgotten
or
are
only
discernible
in
their
effects
conquerors
statesmen
and
kings
live
but
by
their
names
stamped
on
the
page
of
history
hume
says
rightly
that
more
people
think
about
virgil
and
homer
and
that
continually
than
ever
trouble
their
heads
about
caesar
or
alexander
in
fact
poets
are
a
race
than
heroes
they
breathe
more
of
the
air
of
immortality
they
survive
more
entire
in
their
thoughts
and
acts
we
have
all
that
virgil
or
homer
did
as
much
as
if
we
had
lived
at
the
same
time
with
them
we
can
hold
their
works
in
our
hands
or
lay
them
on
our
pillows
or
put
them
to
our
lips
scarcely
a
trace
of
what
the
others
did
is
left
upon
the
earth
so
as
to
be
visible
to
common
eyes
the
one
the
dead
authors
are
living
men
still
breathing
and
moving
in
their
writings
the
others
the
conquerors
of
the
world
are
but
the
ashes
in
an
urn
the
sympathy
so
to
speak
between
thought
and
thought
is
more
intimate
and
vital
than
that
between
thought
and
action
though
of
admiration
to
the
manes
of
departed
heroism
is
like
burning
incense
in
a
marble
monument
words
ideas
feelings
with
the
progress
of
time
harden
into
substances
things
bodies
actions
moulder
away
or
melt
into
a
sound
into
thin
air
yet
though
the
schoolmen
in
the
middle
ages
disputed
more
about
the
texts
of
aristotle
than
the
battle
of
arbela
perhaps
alexander
generals
in
his
lifetime
admired
his
pupil
as
much
and
liked
him
better
for
not
only
a
man
actions
are
effaced
and
vanish
with
him
his
virtues
and
generous
qualities
die
with
him
also
his
intellect
only
is
immortal
and
bequeathed
unimpaired
to
posterity
words
are
the
only
things
that
last
for
ever
if
however
the
empire
of
words
and
general
knowledge
is
more
durable
in
proportion
as
it
is
abstracted
and
attenuated
it
is
less
immediate
and
dazzling
if
authors
are
as
good
after
they
are
dead
as
when
they
were
living
while
living
they
might
as
well
be
dead
and
moreover
with
respect
to
actual
ability
to
write
a
book
is
not
the
only
proof
of
taste
sense
or
spirit
as
pedants
would
have
us
suppose
to
do
anything
well
to
paint
a
picture
to
fight
a
battle
to
make
a
plough
or
a
requires
one
would
think
as
much
skill
and
judgment
as
to
talk
about
or
write
a
description
of
it
when
done
words
are
universal
intelligible
signs
but
they
are
not
the
only
real
existing
things
did
not
julius
caesar
show
himself
as
much
of
a
man
in
conducting
his
campaigns
as
in
composing
his
commentaries
or
was
the
retreat
of
the
ten
thousand
under
xenophon
or
his
work
of
that
name
the
most
consummate
performance
or
would
not
lovelace
supposing
him
to
have
existed
and
to
have
conceived
and
executed
all
his
fine
stratagems
on
the
spur
of
the
occasion
have
been
as
clever
a
fellow
as
richardson
who
invented
them
in
cold
blood
if
to
conceive
and
describe
an
heroic
character
is
the
height
of
a
literary
ambition
we
can
hardly
make
it
out
that
to
be
and
to
do
all
that
the
wit
of
man
can
feign
is
nothing
to
use
means
to
ends
to
set
causes
in
motion
to
wield
the
machine
of
society
to
subject
the
wills
of
others
to
your
own
to
manage
abler
men
than
yourself
by
means
of
that
which
is
stronger
in
them
than
their
wisdom
viz
their
weakness
and
their
folly
to
calculate
the
resistance
of
ignorance
and
prejudice
to
your
designs
and
by
obviating
to
turn
them
to
account
to
foresee
a
long
obscure
and
complicated
train
of
events
of
chances
and
openings
of
success
to
unwind
the
web
of
policy
and
weave
your
own
out
of
it
to
judge
of
the
effects
of
things
not
in
the
abstract
but
with
reference
to
all
their
bearings
ramifications
and
impediments
to
understand
character
thoroughly
to
see
latent
talent
or
lurking
treachery
to
know
mankind
for
what
they
are
and
use
them
as
they
deserve
to
have
a
purpose
steadily
in
view
and
to
effect
it
after
removing
every
obstacle
to
master
others
and
be
true
to
yourself
asks
power
and
knowledge
both
nerves
and
brain
such
is
the
sort
of
talent
that
that
may
be
shown
and
that
has
been
possessed
by
the
great
leaders
on
the
stage
of
the
world
to
accomplish
great
things
argues
i
imagine
great
resolution
to
design
great
things
implies
no
common
mind
ambition
is
in
some
sort
genius
though
i
would
rather
wear
out
my
life
in
arguing
a
broad
speculative
question
than
in
caballing
for
the
election
to
a
wardmote
or
canvassing
for
votes
in
a
rotten
borough
yet
i
should
think
that
the
loftiest
epicurean
philosopher
might
descend
from
his
punctilio
to
identify
himself
with
the
support
of
a
great
principle
or
to
prop
a
falling
state
this
is
what
the
legislators
and
founders
of
empire
did
of
old
and
the
permanence
of
their
institutions
showed
the
depth
of
the
principles
from
which
they
emanated
a
tragic
poem
is
not
the
worse
for
acting
well
if
it
will
not
bear
this
test
it
savours
of
effeminacy
schemes
will
stand
the
touchstone
of
experience
great
thoughts
reduced
to
practice
become
great
acts
again
great
acts
grow
out
of
great
occasions
and
great
occasions
spring
from
great
principles
working
changes
in
society
and
tearing
it
up
by
the
roots
but
i
still
conceive
that
a
genius
for
actions
depends
essentially
on
the
strength
of
the
will
rather
than
on
that
of
the
understanding
that
the
calculation
of
causes
and
consequences
arises
from
the
energy
of
the
first
cause
which
is
the
will
setting
others
in
motion
and
prepared
to
anticipate
the
results
that
its
sagacity
is
activity
delighting
in
meeting
difficulties
and
adventures
more
than
and
its
wisdom
courage
not
to
shrink
from
danger
but
to
redouble
its
efforts
with
opposition
its
humanity
if
it
has
much
is
magnanimity
to
spare
the
vanquished
exulting
in
power
but
not
prone
to
mischief
with
good
sense
enough
to
be
aware
of
the
instability
of
fortune
and
with
some
regard
to
reputation
what
may
serve
as
a
criterion
to
try
this
question
by
is
the
following
consideration
that
we
sometimes
find
as
remarkable
a
deficiency
of
the
speculative
faculty
coupled
with
great
strength
of
will
and
consequent
success
in
active
life
as
we
do
a
want
of
voluntary
power
and
total
incapacity
for
business
frequently
joined
to
the
highest
mental
qualifications
in
some
cases
it
will
happen
that
be
wise
is
to
be
obstinate
if
you
are
deaf
to
reason
but
stick
to
your
own
purposes
you
will
tire
others
out
and
bring
them
over
to
your
way
of
thinking
and
blind
prejudice
are
the
best
defence
of
actual
power
and
exclusive
advantages
the
forehead
of
the
late
king
was
not
remarkable
for
the
character
of
intellect
but
the
lower
part
of
his
face
was
expressive
of
strong
passions
and
fixed
resolution
charles
fox
had
an
animated
intelligent
eye
and
brilliant
elastic
forehead
with
a
nose
indicating
fine
taste
but
the
lower
features
were
weak
unsettled
fluctuating
and
without
it
was
in
them
the
whigs
were
defeated
what
a
fine
iron
binding
buonaparte
had
round
his
face
as
if
it
had
been
cased
in
steel
what
sensibility
about
the
mouth
what
watchful
penetration
in
the
eye
what
a
smooth
unruffled
forehead
pitt
with
little
sunken
eyes
had
a
high
retreating
forehead
and
a
nose
expressing
pride
and
aspiring
it
was
on
that
with
submission
that
he
suspended
the
decisions
of
the
house
of
commons
and
dangled
the
opposition
as
he
pleased
lord
castlereagh
is
a
man
rather
deficient
than
redundant
in
words
and
topics
he
is
not
any
more
than
augustine
was
in
the
opinion
of
la
fontaine
so
great
a
wit
as
rabelais
nor
is
he
so
great
a
philosopher
as
aristotle
but
he
has
that
in
him
which
is
not
to
be
trifled
with
he
has
a
noble
mask
of
a
face
not
well
filled
up
in
the
expression
which
is
relaxed
and
dormant
with
a
fine
person
and
manner
on
the
strength
of
these
he
hazards
his
speeches
in
the
house
he
has
also
a
knowledge
of
mankind
and
of
the
composition
of
the

he
takes
a
thrust

when
to
pay
a
compliment
to
a
wavering
antagonist
soothes
the
melting
mood
of
his
hearers
or
gets
up
a
speech
full
of
indignation
and
knows
how
to
bestow
his
attentions
on
that
great
public
body
whether
he
wheedles
or
bullies
so
as
to
bring
it
to
compliance
with
a
long
reach
of
undefined
purposes
the
result
of

indolent
for

would
rather
be

far
as
a

of

is

principle
is
out
of

than
such
a

as

is
a
mere
fluent
sophist

never

the
limit
of
discretion

the
effect

buonaparte
is
referred
by
coleridge
to
the
class
of
active
rather
than
of
intellectual
characters
and
cowley
has
left
an
invidious
but
splendid
eulogy
on
oliver
cromwell
which
sets
out
on
much
the
same
principle
he
says
be
more
extraordinary
than
that
a
person
of
mean
birth
no
fortune
no
eminent
qualities
of
body
which
have
sometimes
or
of

which
have
often
raised
men
to
the
highest
dignities
should
have
the
courage
to
attempt
and
the
happiness
to
succeed
in
so
improbable
a
design
as
the
destruction
of
one
of
the
most
ancient
and
most
monarchies
upon
the
earth
that
he
should
have
the
power
or
boldness
to
put
his
prince
and
master
to
an
open
and
infamous
death
to
banish
that
numerous
and
family
to
do
all
this
under
the
name
and
wages
of
a
parliament
to
trample
upon
them
too
as
he
pleased
and
spurn
them
out
of
doors
when
he
grow
weary
of
them
to
raise
up
a
new
and
monster
out
of
their
ashes
to
stifle
that
in
the
very
infancy
and
set
up
himself
above
all
things
that
ever
were
called
sovereign
in
england
to
oppress
all
his
enemies
by
arms
and
all
his
friends
afterwards
by
artifice
to
serve
all
parties
patiently
for
a
while
and
to
command
them
victoriously
at
last
to
overrun
each
corner
of
the
three
nations
and
overcome
with
equal
facility
both
the
riches
of
the
south
and
the
poverty
of
the
north
to
be
feared
and
courted
by
all
foreign
princes
and
adopted
a
brother
to
the
gods
of
the
earth
to
call
together
parliaments
with
a
word
of
his
pen
and
scatter
them
again
with
the
breath
of
his
mouth
to
be
humbly
and
daily
petitioned
that
he
would
please
to
be
hired
at
the
rate
of
two
millions
a
year
to
be
the
master
of
those
who
had
hired
him
before
to
be
their
servant
to
have
the
estates
and
lives
of
three
kingdoms
as
much
at
his
disposal
as
was
the
little
inheritance
of
his
father
and
to
be
as
noble
and
liberal
in
the
spending
of
them
and
lastly
for
there
is
no
end
of
all
the
particulars
of
his
glory
to
bequeath
all
this
with
one
word
to
his
posterity
to
die
with
peace
at
home
and
triumph
abroad
to
be
buried
among
kings
and
with
more
than
regal
solemnity
and
to
leave
a
name
behind
him
not
to
be
extinguished
but
with
the
whole
world
which
as
it
is
now
too
little
for
his
praises
so
might
have
been
too
for
his
conquests
if
the
short
line
of
his
human
life
could
have
been
stretched
out
to
the
extent
of
his
immortal
designs
cromwell
was
a
bad
speaker
and
a
worse
writer
milton
wrote
his
despatches
for
him
in
elegant
and
erudite
latin
and
the
pen
of
the
one
like
the
sword
of
the
other
was
and
sweet
we
have
not
that
union
in
modern
times
of
the
heroic
and
literary
character
which
was
common
among
the
ancients
julius
caesar
and
xenophon
recorded
their
own
acts
with
equal
clearness
of
style
and
modesty
of
temper
the
duke
of
wellington
worse
off
than
cromwell
is
obliged
to
get
mudford
to
write
the
history
of
his
life
sophocles
aeschylus
and
socrates
were
distinguished
for
their
military
prowess
among
their
contemporaries
though
now
only
remembered
for
what
they
did
in
poetry
and
philosophy
cicero
and
demosthenes
the
two
greatest
orators
of
antiquity
appear
to
have
been
cowards
nor
does
horace
seem
to
give
a
very
favourable
picture
of
his
martial
achievements
but
in
general
there
was
not
that
division
in
the
labours
of
the
mind
and
body
among
the
greeks
and
romans
that
has
been
introduced
among
us
either
by
the
progress
of
civilisation
or
by
a
greater
slowness
and
inaptitude
of
parts
the
french
for
instance
appear
to
unite
a
number
of
accomplishments
the
literary
character
and
the
man
of
the
world
better
than
we
do
among
us
a
scholar
is
almost
another
name
for
a
pedant
or
a
clown
it
is
not
so
with
them
their
philosophers
and
wits
went
into
the
world
and
mingled
in
the
society
of
the
fair
of
this
there
needs
no
other
proof
than
the
spirited
print
of
most
of
the
great
names
in
french
literature
to
whom
moliere
is
reading
a
comedy
in
the
presence
of
the
celebrated
ninon
de
one
of
the
first
mathematicians
of
his
age
was
a
wit
a
man
of
gallantry
and
letters
with
us
a
learned
man
is
absorbed
in
himself
and
some
particular
study
and
minds
nothing
else
there
is
something
ascetic
and
impracticable
in
his
very
constitution
and
he
answers
to
the
description
of
the
monk
in
spenser
from
every
work
he
challenged
essoin
for
contemplation
sake
perhaps
the
superior
importance
attached
to
the
institutions
of
religion
as
well
as
the
more
abstracted
and
visionary
nature
of
its
objects
has
led
as
a
general
result
to
a
wider
separation
between
thought
and
action
in
modern
times
ambition
is
of
a
higher
and
more
heroic
strain
than
avarice
its
objects
are
nobler
and
the
means
by
which
it
attains
its
ends
less
mechanical
better
be
lord
of
them
that
riches
have
than
riches
have
myself
and
be
their
servile
slave
the
incentive
to
ambition
is
the
love
of
power
the
spur
to
avarice
is
either
the
fear
of
poverty
or
a
strong
desire
of
the
amassers
of
fortunes
seem
divided
into
two
opposite
classes
lean
mortals
or
jolly
fellows
who
are
determined
to
get
possession
of
because
they
want
to
enjoy
the
good
things
of
the
wo
others
in
the
fulness
of
their
persons
and
the
robustness
of
their
constitutions
seem
to
bespeak
the
reversion
of
a
landed
estate
rich
acres
fat
beeves
a
substantial
mansion
costly
clothing
a
chine
and
curkey
choice
wines
and
all
other
good
things
consonant
to
the
wants
and
desires
of
their
bodies
such
men
charm
fortune
by
the
sleekness
of
their
aspects
and
the
goodly
rotundity
of
their
honest
faces
as
the

scare
away

by
their

much
to

the
ostentatious
marks
of

there
are
persons
enough
to
admire
them
without
me
but
i
confess
there
is
something
in
the
look
of
the
old
in
lombard
street
the
posterns
covered
with
mud
the
doors
opening
sullenly
and
silently
the
absence
of
all
pretence
the
darkness
and
the
gloom
within
the
gleaming
of
lamps
in
the
like
a
faint
shadow
of
uncertain
light
that
almost
realises
the
poetical
conception
of
the
cave
of
mammon
in
spenser
where
dust
and
cobwebs
concealed
the
roofs
and
pillars
of
solid
gold
and
lifts
the
mind
quite
off
its
ordinary
hinges
the
account
of
the
manner
in
which
the
founder
of
guy
hospital
accumulated
his
immense
wealth
has
always
to
me
something
romantic
in
it
from
the
same
force
of
contrast
he
was
a
little

out
of

the

suggests
the

is
there
anything
in

when

left
the
chamber

to
go

fight
his
last
fatal
battle
he
advised
them

he

he
was

his
love
might
be
as
great
as
he
makes
it
out
but
it
was
not
his
ruling
passion
his
fear
his
pride
his
vanity
was
greater
let

be
steeped

this
passion
let

nothing

let
nothing
divert

feeling
become
an
actual
one
and
take

the

voluptuous

govern
his
actions
in

on
few
things
show
the
human
character
in
a
more
ridiculous
light
than
the
circumstance
of
it
is
the
latest
opportunity
we
have
of
exercising
the
natural
perversity
of
the
disposition
and
we
take
care
to
make
a
good
use
of
it
we
husband
it
with
jealousy
put
it
off
as
long
as
we
can
and
then
use
every
precaution
that
the
world
shall
be
no
gainer
by
our
deaths
this
last
act
of
our
lives
seldom
belies
the
former
tenor
of
them
for
stupidity
caprice
and
unmeaning
spite
all
that
we
seem
to
think
of
is
to
manage
matters
so
in
settling
accounts
with
those
who
are
so
unmannerly
as
to
survive
us
as
to
do
as
little
good
and
to
plague
and
disappoint
as
many
people
as
possible
many
persons
have
a
superstition
on
the
subject
of
making
their
last
will
and
testament
and
think
that
when
everything
is
ready
signed
and
sealed
there
is
nothing
further
left
to
delay
their
departure
i
have
heard
of
an
instance
of
one
person
who
having
a
feeling
of
this
kind
on
his
mind
and
being
teased
into
making
his
will
by
those
about
him
actually
fell
ill
with
pure
apprehension
and
thought
he
was
going
to
die
in
good
earnest
but
having
executed
the
deed
awoke
to
his
great
surprise
the
next
morning
and
found
himself
as
well
as
ever
he
was
an
elderly
gentleman
possessed
of
a
good
estate
and
the
same
idle
notion
and
who
found
himself
in
a
dangerous
way
was
anxious
to
do
this
piece
of
justice
to
those
who
remained
behind
him
but
when
it
came
to
the
point
his
heart
failed
him
and
his
nervous
fancies
returned
in
full
force
even
on
his
he
still
held
back
and
was
averse
to
sign
what
he
looked
upon
as
his
own
and
just
at
the
last
gasp
amidst
the
anxious
looks
and
silent
upbraidings
of
friends
and
relatives
that
surrounded
him
he
summoned
resolution
to
hold
out
his
feeble
hand
which
was
guided
by
others
to
trace
his
name
and
he
fell
back
a
corpse
if
there
is
any
pressing
reason
for
it
that
is
if
any
particular
person
would
be
relieved
from
a
state
of
harassing
uncertainty
or
materially
benefited
by
their
making
a
will
the
old
and
infirm
who
do
not
like
to
be
put
out
of
their
way
generally
make
this
an
excuse
to
themselves
for
putting
it
off
to
the
very
last
moment
probably
till
it
is
too
late
or
where
this
is
sure
to
make
the
greatest
number
of
blank
faces
contrive
to
give
their
friends
the
slip
without
signifying
their
final
determination
in
their
favour
where
some
unfortunate
individual
has
been
kept
long
in
suspense
who
has
been
perhaps
sought
out
for
that
very
purpose
and
who
may
be
in
a
great
measure
dependent
on
this
as
a
last
resource
it
is
nearly
a
certainty
that
there
will
be
no
will
to
be
found
no
trace
no
sign
to
discover
whether
the
person
dying
thus
intestate
ever
had
any
intention
of
the
sort
or
why
they
relinquished
it
this
is
to
bespeak
the
thoughts
and
imaginations
of
others
for
victims
after
we
are
dead
as
well
as
their
persons
and
expectations
for
while
we
are
living
a
celebrated
beauty
of
the
middle
of
the
last
century
towards
its
close
sought
out
a
female
relative
the
friend
and
companion
of
her
youth
who
had
lived
during
the
forty
years
of
their
separation
in
rather
straitened
circumstances
and
in
a
situation
which
admitted
of
some
alleviations
twice
they
met
after
that
long
lapse
of
time
once
her
relation
visited
her
in
the
splendour
of
a
rich
old
family
mansion
and
once
she
crossed
the
country
to
become
an
inmate
of
the
humble
dwelling
of
her
early
and
only
remaining
friend
what
was
this
for
was
it
to
revive
the
image
of
her
youth
in
the
pale
and
careworn
face
of
her
friend
or
was
it
to
display
the
decay
of
her
charms
and
recall
her
triumphs
to
the
memory
of
the
only
person
who
could
bear
witness
to
them
was
it
to
show
the
proud
remains
of
herself
to
those
who
remembered
or
had
often
heard
what
she
was
her
skin
like
shrivelled
alabaster
her
emaciated
features
chiselled
by
nature
finest
hand
her
eyes
that
when
a
smile
lighted
them
up
still
shone
like
diamonds
the
vermilion
hues
that
still
bloomed
among
wrinkles
was
it
to
talk
of
of
the
flounces
and
brocades
of
the
last
century
of
in
the
year
and
of
the
scores
of
lovers
that
had
died
at
her
feet
and
to
set
whole
counties
in
a
flame
again
only
with
a
dream
of
faded
beauty
whether
it
was
for
this
or
whether
she
meant
to
leave
her
friend
anything
as
was
indeed
expected
all
things
considered
not
without
reason
nobody
knows
for
she
never
breathed
a
syllable
on
the
subject
herself
and
died
without
a
will
the
accomplished
coquette
of
twenty
who
had
pampered
hopes
only
to
kill
them
who
had
kindled
rapture
with
a
look
and
extinguished
it
with
a
breath
could
find
no
better
employment
at
seventy
than
to
revive
the
fond
recollections
and
raise
up
the
drooping
hopes
of
her
kinswoman
only
to
let
them
fall
to
rise
no
more
such
is
the
delight
we
have
in
trifling
with
and
tantalising
the
feelings
of
others
by
the
exquisite
refinements
the
studied
sleights
of
love
or
friendship
where
a
property
is
actually
bequeathed
supposing
the
circumstances
of
the
case
and
the
usages
of
society
to
leave
a
practical
discretion
to
the
testator
it
is
most
frequently
in
such
portions
as
can
be
of
the
least
service
where
there
is
much
already
much
is
given
where
much
is
wanted
little
or
nothing
poverty
invites
a
sort
of
pity
a
miserable
dole
of
assistance
necessity
neglect
and
scorn
wealth
attracts
and
allures
to
itself
more
wealth
by
natural
association
of
ideas
or
by
that
innate
love
of
inequality
and
injustice
which
is
the
favourite
principle
of
the
imagination
men
like
to
collect
money
into
large
heaps
in
their
lifetime
they
like
to
leave
it
in
large
heaps
after
they
are
dead
they
grasp
it
into
their
own
hands
not
to
use
it
for
their
own
good
but
to
hoard
to
lock
it
up
to
make
an
object
an
idol
and
a
wonder
of
it
do
you
expect
them
to
distribute
it
so
as
to
do
others
good
that
they
will
like
those
who
come
after
them
better
than
themselves
that
if
they
were
willing
to
pinch
and
starve
themselves
they
will
not
deliberately
defraud
their
sworn
friends
and
nearest
kindred
of
what
would
be
of
the
utmost
use
to
them
no
they
will
thrust
their
heaps
of
gold
and
silver
into
the
hands
of
others
as
their
proxies
to
keep
for
them
untouched
still
increasing
still
of
no
use
to
any
one
but
to
pamper
pride
and
avarice
to
glitter
in
the
huge
watchful
insatiable
eye
of
fancy
to
be
deposited
as
a
new
offering
at
the
shrine
of
mammon
their
god
this
is
with
them
to
put
it
to
its
intelligible
and
proper
use
this
is
fulfilling
a
sacred
indispensable
duty
this
cheers
them
in
the
solitude
of
the
grave
and
throws
a
gleam
of
satisfaction
across
the
stony
eye
of
death
but
to
think
of
frittering
it
down
of
sinking
it
in
charity
of
throwing
it
away
on
the
idle
claims
of
humanity
where
it
would
no
longer
peer
in
monumental
pomp
over
their
heads
and
that
too
when
on
the
point
of
death
themselves
articulo
mortis
oh
it
would
be
madness
waste
extravagance
impiety
thus
worldlings
feel
and
argue
without
knowing
it
and
while
they
fancy
they
are
studying
their
own
interest
or
that
of
some
booby
successor
their
idem
are
but
the
dupes
and
puppets
of
a
favourite
idea
a
phantom
a
prejudice
that
must
be
kept
up
somewhere
no
matter
where
if
it
still
plays
before
and
haunts
their
imagination
while
they
have
sense
or
understanding
left
to
cling
to
their
darling
follies
there
was
a
remarkable
instance
of
this
tendency
the
heap
this
desire
to
cultivate
an
abstract
passion
for
wealth
in
a
will
of
one
of
the
thelussons
some
time
back
this
will
went
to
keep
the
greater
part
of
a
large
property
from
the
use
of
the
natural
heirs
and
for
a
length
of
time
and
to
let
it
accumulate
at
compound
interest
in
such
a
way
and
so
long
that
it
would
at
last
mount
up
in
value
to
the
of
a
whole
county
the
interest
accruing
from
the
funded
property
or
the
rent
of
the
lands
at
certain
periods
was
to
be
employed
to
purchase
other
estates
other
parks
and
manors
in
the
neighbourhood
or
farther
off
so
that
the
prospect
of
the
future
demesne
that
was
to
devolve
at
some
distant
time
to
the
unborn
lord
of
acres
swelled
and
enlarged
itself
like
a
sea
circle
without
circle
vista
beyond
vista
till
the
imagination
was
staggered
and
the
mind
exhausted
now
here
was
a
scheme
for
the
accumulation
of
wealth
and
for
laying
the
foundation
of
family
aggrandisement
purely
imaginary
romantic
one
might
almost
say
disinterested
the
vagueness
the
magnitude
the
remoteness
of
the
object
the
resolute
sacrifice
of
all
immediate
and
gross
advantages
clothe
it
with
the
privileges
of
an
abstract
idea
so
that
the
project
has
the
air
of
a
fiction
or
of
a
story
in
a
novel
it
was
an
instance
of
what
might
be
called
posthumous
avarice
like
the
love
of
posthumous
fame
it
had
little
more
to
do
with
selfishness
than
if
the
testator
had
appropriated
the
same
sums
in
the
same
way
to
build
a
pyramid
to
construct
an
aqueduct
to
endow
a
hospital
or
effect
any
other
patriotic
or
merely
fantastic
purpose
he
wished
to
heap
up
a
pile
of
wealth
millions
of
acres
in
the
dim
horizon
of
future
years
that
could
be
of
no
use
to
him
or
to
those
with
whom
he
was
connected
by
positive
and
personal
ties
but
as
a
crotchet
of
the
brain
a
gewgaw
of
the
fancy
yet
to
enable
himself
to
put
this
scheme
in
execution
he
had
perhaps
toiled
and
watched
all
his
life
denied
himself
rest
food
pleasure
liberty
society
and
persevered
with
the
patience
and
of
a
martyr
i
have
insisted
on
this
point
the
more
to
show
how
much
of
the
imaginary
and
speculative
there
is
interfused
even
in
those
passions
and
purposes
which
have
not
the
good
of
others
for
their
object
and
how
little
reason
this
honest
citizen
and
builder
of
castles
in
the
air
would
have
had
to
treat
those
who
devoted
themselves
to
the
pursuit
of
fame
to
obloquy
and
persecution
for
the
sake
of
truth
and
liberty
or
who
sacrificed
their
lives
for
their
country
in
a
just
cause
as
visionaries
and
enthusiasts
who
did
not
understand
what
was
properly
due
to
their
own
interest
and
the
securing
of
the
main
chance
man
is
not
the
creature
of
sense
and
selfishness
even
in
those
pursuits
which
grow
out
of
that
origin
so
much
as
of
imagination
custom
passion
whim
and
humour
i
have
heard
of
a
singular
instance
of
a
will
made
by
a
person
who
was
addicted
to
a
habit
of
lying
he
was
so
notorious
for
this
propensity
not
out
of
spite
or
cunning
but
as
a
gratuitous
exercise
of
invention
that
from
a
child
no
one
could
ever
believe
a
syllable
he
uttered
from
the
want
of
any
dependence
to
be
placed
on
him
he
became
the
jest
and
of
the
school
where
he
was
brought
up
the
last
act
of
his
life
did
not
disgrace
him
for
having
gone
abroad
and
falling
into
a
dangerous
decline
he
was
advised
to
return
home
he
paid
all
that
he
was
worth
for
his
passage
went
on
and
employed
a
few
remaining
days
he
had
to
live
in
making
and
executing
his
will
in
which
he
bequeathed
large
estates
in
different
parts
of
england
money
in
the
funds
rich
jewels
rings
and
all
kinds
of
valuables
to
his
old
friends
and
acquaintance
who
not
knowing
how
far
the
force
of
nature
could
go
were
not
for
some
time
convinced
that
all
this
fairy
wealth
had
never
had
an
existence
anywhere
but
in
the
idle
coinage
of
his
brain
whose
whims
and
projects
were
no
more
the
extreme
keeping
in
this
character
is
only
to
be
accounted
for
by
supposing
such
an
original
constitutional
levity
as
made
truth
entirely
indifferent
to
him
and
the
serious
importance
attached
to
it
by
others
an
object
of
perpetual
sport
and
ridicule
the
art
of
chiefly
consists
in
baffling
the
importunity
of
expectation
i
do
not
so
much
find
fault
with
this
when
it
is
done
as
a
punishment
and
oblique
satire
on
servility
and
selfishness
it
is
in
that
case
cut
a
trial
of
skill
between
the
and
the
which
shall
fool
the
other
the
cringing
the
officious
is
perhaps
well
paid
for
years
of
obsequious
attendance
with
a
bare
mention
and
a
nor
can
i
think
that
gil
blas
library
was
not
quite
as
much
as
the
coxcombry
of
his
pretensions
deserved
there
are
some
admirable
scenes
in
ben
jonson
showing
the
humours
of
a
and
the
different
ways
of
fobbing
him
off
with
excuses
and
assurances
of
not
being
forgotten
yet
it
is
hardly
right
after
all
to
encourage
this
kind
of
pitiful
barefaced
intercourse
without
meaning
to
pay
for
it
as
the
coquette
has
no
right
to
jilt
the
lovers
she
has
trifled
with
flattery
and
submission
are
marketable
commodities
like
any
other
have
their
price
and
ought
scarcely
to
be
obtained
under
false
pretences
if
we
see
through
and
despise
the
wretched
creature
that
attempts
to
impose
on
our
credulity
we
can
at
any
time
dispense
with
his
services
if
we
are
soothed
by
this
mockery
of
respect
and
friendship
why
not
pay
him
like
any
other
drudge
or
as
we
satisfy
the
actor
who
performs
a
part
in
a
play
by
our
particular
desire
but
often
these
premeditated
disappointments
are
as
unjust
as
they
are
cruel
and
are
marked
with
circumstances
of
indignity
in
proportion
to
the
worth
of
the
object
the
suspecting
the
taking
it
for
granted
that
your
name
is
down
in
the
will
is
sufficient
provocation
to
have
it
struck
out
the
hinting
at
an
obligation
the
consciousness
of
it
on
the
part
of
the
testator
will
make
him
determined
to
avoid
the
formal
acknowledgment
of
it
at
any
expense
the
disinheriting
of
relations
is
mostly
for
venial
offences
not
for
base
actions
we
punish
out
of
pique
to
revenge
some
case
in
which
we
been
disappointed
of
our
wills
some
act
of
disobedience
to
what
had
no
reasonable
ground
to
go
upon
and
we
are
obstinate
in
adhering
to
our
resolution
as
it
was
sudden
and
rash
and
doubly
bent
on
asserting
our
authority
in
what
we
have
least
right
to
interfere
in
it
is
the
wound
inflicted
upon
our
not
the
stain
upon
the
character
of
the
thoughtless
offender
that
calls
for
condign
punishment
crimes
vices
may
go
unchecked
or
unnoticed
but
it
is
the
laughing
at
our
weaknesses
or
thwarting
our
humours
that
is
never
to
be
forgotten
it
is
not
the
errors
of
others
but
our
own
miscalculations
on
which
we
wreak
our
lasting
vengeance
it
is
ourselves
that
we
can
not
forgive
in
the
will
of
nicholas
gimcrack
the
virtuoso
recorded
in
the
we
learn
among
other
items
that
his
eldest
son
is
cut
off
with
a
single
cockleshell
for
his
undutiful
behaviour
in
laughing
at
his
little
sister
whom
his
father
kept
preserved
in
spirits
of
wine
another
of
his
relations
has
a
collection
of
grasshoppers
bequeathed
him
as
in
the
testator
opinion
an
adequate
reward
and
acknowledgment
due
to
his
merit
the
whole
will
of
the
said
nicholas
gimcrack
is
a
curious
document
and
exact
picture
of
the
mind
of
the
worthy
virtuoso
defunct
where
his
various
follies
littlenesses
and
quaint
humours
are
set
forth
as
orderly
and
distinct
as
his
butterflies
wings
and
and
skeletons
of
fleas
in
glass
cases
we
often
successfully
try
in
this
way
to
give
the
finishing
stroke
to
our
pictures
hang
up
our
weaknesses
in
perpetuity
and
embalm
our
mistakes
in
the
memories
of
others
even
from
the
tomb
the
voice
of
nature
cries
even
in
our
ashes
live
their
wonted
fires
i
shall
not
speak
here
of
unwarrantable
commands
imposed
upon
survivors
by
which
they
were
to
carry
into
effect
the
sullen
and
revengeful
purposes
of
unprincipled
men
after
they
had
breathed
their
last
but
we
meet
with
continual
examples
of
the
desire
to
keep
up
the
farce
if
not
the
tragedy
of
life
after
we
the
performers
in
it
have
quitted
the
stage
and
to
have
our
parts
rehearsed
by
proxy
we
thus
make
a
caprice
immortal
a
peculiarity
proverbial
hence
we
see
the
number
of
legacies
and
fortunes
left
on
condition
that
the
legatee
shall
take
the
name
and
style
of
the
testator
by
which
device
we
provide
for
the
continuance
of
the
sounds
that
formed
our
names
and
endow
them
with
an
estate
that
they
may
be
repeated
with
proper
respect
in
the
of
an
all
the
difficulties
of
the
plot
turn
on
the
necessity
imposed
by
a
clause
in
her
uncle
will
that
her
future
husband
should
take
the
family
name
of
beverley
poor
cecilia
what
delicate
perplexities
she
was
thrown
into
by
this
improvident
provision
and
with
what
minute
endless
intricate
distresses
has
the
fair
authoress
been
enabled
to
harrow
up
the
reader
on
this
account
there
was
a
sir
thomas
dyot
in
the
reign
of
charles
ii
who
left
the
whole
range
of
property
which
forms
dyot
street
in
giles
and
the
neighbourhood
on
the
sole
and
express
condition
that
it
should
be
appropriated
entirely
to
that
sort
of
buildings
and
to
the
reception
of
that
sort
of
population
which
still
keeps
undisputed
undivided
possession
of
it
the
name
was
changed
the
other
day
to
george
street
as
a
more
genteel
appellation
which
i
should
think
is
an
indirect
forfeiture
of
the
estate
this
sir
thomas
dyot
i
should
be
disposed
to
put
upon
the
list
of
old
english
worthies
as
humane
liberal
and
no
flincher
from
what
he
took
in
his
head
he
was
no
man
in
his
line
he
was
the
best
commentator
on
that
text
foxes
have
holes
and
the
birds
of
the
air
have
nests
but
the
son
of
man
hath
not
where
to
lay
his
head
we
find
some
that
are
curious
in
the
mode
in
which
they
shall
be
buried
and
others
in
the
place
lord
camelford
had
his
remains
buried
under
an
ash
tree
that
grew
on
one
of
the
mountains
in
switzerland
and
sir
francis
bourgeois
had
a
little
mausoleum
built
for
him
in
the
college
at
dulwich
where
he
once
spent
a
pleasant
jovial
day
with
the
masters
and
wardens
it
is
no
doubt
proper
to
attend
except
for
strong
reasons
to
the
contrary
to
these
sort
of
requests
for
by
breaking
faith
with
the
dead
we
loosen
the
confidence
of
the
living
besides
there
is
a
stronger
argument
we
sympathise
with
the
dead
as
well
as
with
the
living
and
are
bound
to
them
by
the
most
sacred
of
all
ties
our
own
involuntary
with
others
thieves
as
a
last
donation
leave
advice
to
their
friends
physicians
a
nostrum
authors
a
manuscript
work
rakes
a
confession
of
their
faith
in
the
virtue
of
the
sex
all
the
last
drivellings
of
their
egotism
and
impertinence
one
might
suppose
that
if
anything
could
the
approach
and
contemplation
of
death
might
bring
men
to
a
sense
of
reason
and
on
the
contrary
it
seems
only
to
deprive
them
of
the
little
wit
they
had
and
to
make
them
even
more
the
sport
of
their
wilfulness
and
shortsightedness
some
men
think
that
because
they
are
going
to
be
hanged
they
are
fully
authorised
to
declare
a
future
state
of
rewards
and
punishments
all
either
indulge
their
caprices
or
cling
to
their
prejudices
they
make
a
desperate
attempt
to
escape
from
reflection
by
taking
hold
of
any
whim
or
fancy
that
crosses
their
minds
or
by
throwing
themselves
implicitly
on
old
habits
and
attachments
an
old
man
is
twice
a
child
the
dying
man
becomes
the
property
of
his
family
he
has
no
choice
left
and
his
voluntary
power
is
merged
in
old
saws
and
prescriptive
usages
the
property
we
have
derived
from
our
kindred
reverts
tacitly
to
them
and
not
to
let
it
take

essay
xiii
on
certain
inconsistencies
in
sir
joshua
discourses
the
two
chief
points
which
sir
joshua
aims
at
in
his
are
to
show
that
excellence
in
the
fine
arts
is
the
result
of
pains
and
study
rather
than
of
genius
and
that
all
beauty
grace
and
grandeur
are
to
be
found
not
in
actual
nature
but
in
an
idea
existing
in
the
mind
on
both
these
points
he
appears
to
have
fallen
into
considerable
inconsistencies
or
very
great
latitude
of
expression
so
as
to
make
it
difficult
to
know
what
conclusion
to
draw
from
his
various
reasonings
i
shall
attempt
little
more
in
this
essay
than
to
bring
together
several
passages
that
from
their
contradictory
import
seem
to
imply
some
radical
defect
in
sir
joshua
theory
and
a
doubt
as
to
the
possibility
of
placing
an
implicit
reliance
on
his
authority
to
begin
with
the
first
of
these
subjects
the
question
of
original
genius
in
the
second
discourse
the
method
of
study
sir
joshua
observes
towards
the
end
is
one
precept
however
in
which
i
shall
only
be
opposed
by
the
vain
the
ignorant
and
the
idle
i
am
not
afraid
that
i
shall
repeat
it
too
often
you
must
have
no
dependence
on
your
own
genius
if
you
have
great
talents
industry
will
improve
them
if
you
have
but
moderate
abilities
industry
will
supply
their
deficiency
nothing
is
denied
to
labour
nothing
is
to
be
obtained
without
it
not
to
enter
into
metaphysical
discussions
on
the
nature
or
essence
of
genius
i
will
venture
to
assert
that
assiduity
unabated
by
difficulty
and
a
disposition
eagerly
directed
to
the
object
of
its
pursuit
will
produce
effects
similar
to
those
which
some
call
the
result
of
powers
the
only
tendency
of
the
maxim
here
laid
down
seems
to
be
to
lure
those
students
on
with
the
hopes
of
excellence
who
have
no
chance
of
succeeding
and
to
deter
those
who
have
from
relying
on
the
only
prop
and
source
of
real
excellence
the
strong
bent
and
impulse
of
their
natural
powers
industry
alone
can
only
produce
mediocrity
but
mediocrity
in
art
is
not
worth
the
trouble
of
industry
genius
great
natural
powers
will
give
industry
and
ardour
in
the
pursuit
of
their
proper
object
but
not
if
you
divert
them
from
that
object
into
the
trammels
of
mechanical
labour
by
this
method
you
neutralise
all
distinction
of
character
make
a
pedant
of
the
blockhead
and
a
drudge
of
the
man
of
genius
what
for
instance
would
have
been
the
effect
of
persuading
hogarth
or
rembrandt
to
place
no
dependence
on
their
own
genius
and
to
apply
themselves
to
the
general
study
of
the
different
branches
of
the
art
and
of
every
sort
of
excellence
with
a
confidence
of
success
proportioned
to
their
misguided
efforts
but
to
destroy
both
those
great
artists
take
my
house
when
you
do
take
the
prop
that
doth
sustain
my
house
you
undermine
the
superstructure
of
art
when
you
strike
at
its
main
pillar
and
support
confidence
and
faith
in
nature
we
might
as
well
advise
a
person
who
had
discovered
a
silver
or
a
lead
mine
on
his
estate
to
close
it
up
or
the
common
farmer
to
plough
up
every
acre
he
rents
in
the
hope
of
discovering
hidden
treasure
as
advise
the
man
of
original
genius
to
neglect
his
particular
vein
for
the
study
of
rules
and
the
imitation
of
others
or
try
to
persuade
the
man
of
no
strong
natural
powers
that
he
can
supply
their
deficiency
by
laborious
application
sir
joshua
soon
after
in
the
third
discourse
alluding
to
the
terms
genius
gusto
applied
by
critics
and
orators
to
painting
proceeds
is
the
warmth
with
which
both
the
ancients
and
moderns
speak
of
this
divine
principle
of
the
art
but
as
i
have
formerly
observed
enthusiastic
admiration
seldom
promotes
knowledge
though
a
student
by
such
praise
may
have
his
attention
roused
and
a
desire
excited
of
running
in
this
great
career
yet
it
is
possible
that
what
has
been
said
to
excite
may
only
serve
to
deter
him
he
examines
his
own
mind
and
perceives
there
nothing
of
that
divine
inspiration
with
which
he
is
told
so
many
others
have
been
favoured
he
never
travelled
to
heaven
to
gather
new
ideas
and
he
finds
himself
possessed
of
no
other
qualifications
than
what
mere
common
observation
and
a
plain
understanding
can
confer
thus
he
becomes
gloomy
amidst
the
splendour
of
figurative
declamation
and
thinks
it
hopeless
to
pursue
an
object
which
he
supposes
out
of
the
reach
of
human
industry
yet
presently
after
he
adds
is
not
easy
to
define
in
what
this
great
style
consists
nor
to
describe
by
words
the
proper
means
of
acquiring
it
the
mind
of
the
student
should
be
at
all
capable
of
such
an
could
we
teach
taste
or
genius
by
rules
they
would
be
no
longer
taste
and
genius
here
then
sir
joshua
admits
that
it
is
a
question
whether
the
student
is
likely
be
at
all
capable
of
such
an
as
the
higher
excellencies
of
art
though
he
had
said
in
the
passage
just
quoted
above
that
it
is
within
the
reach
of
constant
assiduity
and
of
a
disposition
eagerly
directed
to
the
object
of
its
pursuit
to
effect
all
that
is
usually
considered
as
the
result
of
natural
powers
is
the
theory
which
our
author
means
to
inculcate
a
mere
delusion
a
mere
arbitrary
assumption
at
one
moment
sir
joshua
attributes
the
hopelessness
of
the
student
to
attain
perfection
to
the
discouraging
influence
of
certain
figurative
and
overstrained
expressions
and
in
the
next
doubts
his
capacity
for
such
an
acquisition
under
any
circumstances
would
he
have
him
hope
against
hope
then
if
he
his
own
mind
and
finds
nothing
there
of
that
divine
inspiration
with
which
he
is
told
so
many
others
have
been
favoured
but
which
he
has
never
felt
himself
if
finds
himself
possessed
of
no
other
qualifications
for
the
highest
efforts
of
genius
and
imagination
what
mere
common
observation
and
a
plain
understanding
can
confer
he
may
as
well
desist
at
once
from
the
brightest
heaven
of
invention
if
the
very
idea
of
the
divinity
of
art
deters
instead
of
animating
him
if
the
enthusiasm
with
which
others
speak
of
it
damps
the
flame
in
his
own
breast
he
had
better
not
enter
into
a
competition
where
he
wants
the
first
principle
of
success
the
daring
to
aspire
and
the
hope
to
excel
he
may
be
assured
he
is
not
the
man
sir
joshua
himself
was
not
struck
at
first
by
the
sight
of
the
masterpieces
of
the
great
style
of
art
and
he
seems
unconsciously
to
have
adopted
this
theory
to
show
that
he
might
still
have
succeeded
in
it
but
for
want
of
due
application
his
hypothesis
goes
to
this
to
make
the
common
run
of
his
readers
fancy
they
can
do
all
that
can
be
done
by
genius
and
to
make
the
man
of
genius
believe
he
can
only
do
what
is
to
be
done
by
mechanical
rules
and
systematic
industry
this
is
not
a
very
feasible
scheme
nor
is
sir
joshua
sufficiently
clear
and
explicit
in
his
reasoning
in
support
of
it
in
speaking
of
carlo
maratti
he
confesses
the
inefficiency
of
this
doctrine
in
a
very
remarkable
manner
maratti
succeeded
better
than
those
i
have
first
named
and
i
think
owes
his
superiority
to
the
extension
of
his
views
besides
his
master
andrea
sacchi
he
imitated
raffaelle
guido
and
the
caraccis
it
is
true
there
is
nothing
very
captivating
in
carlo
maratti
but
this
proceeded
from
a
want
which
can
not
be
completely
supplied
that
is
want
of
strength
of
parts
this
certainly
men
are
not
equal
and
a
man
can
bring
home
wares
only
in
proportion
with
the
capital
with
which
he
goes
to
market
carlo
by
diligence
made
the
most
of
what
he
had
but
there
was
undoubtedly
a
heaviness
about
him
which
extended
itself
uniformly
to
his
invention
expression
his
drawing
colouring
and
the
general
effect
of
his
pictures
the
truth
is
he
never
equalled
any
of
his
patterns
in
any
one
thing
and
he
added
little
of
his
own
here
then
reynolds
we
see
fairly
gives
up
the
argument
carlo
after
all
was
a
heavy
hand
nor
could
all
his
diligence
and
his
making
the
most
of
what
he
had
make
up
for
the
want
of
powers
sir
joshua
good
sense
pointed
out
to
him
the
truth
in
the
individual
instance
though
he
might
be
led
astray
by
a
vague
general
theory
such
however
is
the
effect
of
a
false
principle
that
there
is
an
evident
bias
in
the
artist
mind
to
make
genius
lean
upon
others
for
support
instead
of
trusting
to
itself
and
developing
its
own
incommunicable
resources
so
in
treating
in
the
twelfth
discourse
of
the
way
in
which
great
artists
are
formed
sir
joshua
reverts
very
nearly
to
his
first
position
daily
food
and
nourishment
of
the
mind
of
an
artist
is
found
in
the
great
works
of
his
predecessors
there
is
no
other
way
for
him
to
become
great
himself
nigi
serpentem
comederit
non
fit
raffaelle
as
appears
from
what
has
been
said
had
carefully
studied
the
works
of
masaccio
and
indeed
there
was
no
other
if
we
except
michael
angelo
whom
he
likewise
imitated
so
worthy
of
his
attention
and
though
his
manner
was
dry
and
hard
his
compositions
formal
and
not
enough
diversified
according
to
the
custom
of
painters
in
that
early
period
yet
his
works
possess
that
grandeur
and
simplicity
which
accompany
and
even
sometimes
proceed
from
regularity
and
hardness
of
manner
we
must
consider
the
barbarous
state
of
the
arts
before
his
time
when
skill
in
drawing
was
so
little
understood
that
the
best
of
the
painters
could
not
even
foreshorten
the
foot
but
every
figure
appeared
to
stand
upon
his
toes
and
what
served
for
drapery
had
from
the
hardness
and
smallness
of
the
folds
too
much
the
appearance
of
cords
clinging
round
the
body
he
first
introduced
large
drapery
flowing
in
an
easy
and
natural
manner
indeed
he
appears
to
be
the
first
who
discovered
the
path
that
leads
to
every
excellence
to
which
the
art
afterwards
arrived
and
may
therefore
be
justly
considered
as
one
of
the
great
fathers
of
modern
art
i
have
been
led
on
to
a
longer
digression
respecting
this
great
painter
than
i
intended
yet
i
can
not
avoid
mentioning
another
excellence
which
he
possessed
in
a
very
eminent
degree
he
was
as
much
distinguished
among
his
contemporaries
for
his
diligence
and
industry
he
was
for
the
natural
faculties
of
his
we
are
told
that
his
whole
attention
was
absorbed
in
the
pursuit
of
his
art
and
that
he
acquired
the
name
of
masaccio
from
his
total
disregard
to
his
dress
his
person
and
all
the
common
concerns
of
life
he
is
indeed
signal
instance
of
what
will
do
in
a
short
time
he
lived
but
years
yet
in
that
short
space
carried
the
art
so
far
beyond
what
it
had
before
reached
that
he
appears
to
stand
alone
as
a
model
for
his
successors
vasari
gives
a
long
catalogue
of
painters
and
sculptors
who
formed
their
taste
and
learned
their
art
by
studying
his
works
among
those
he
names
michael
angelo
leonardo
da
vinci
pietro
perugino
raffaelle
bartholomeo
andrea
del
sarto
il
rosso
and
pierino
del
vaga
sir
joshua
here
again
halts
between
two
opinions
he
tells
us
the
names
of
the
painters
who
formed
themselves
upon
masaccio
style
he
does
not
tell
us
on
whom
he
formed
himself
at
one
time
the
natural
faculties
of
his
mind
were
as
remarkable
as
his
industry
at
another
he
was
only
a
signal
instance
of
what
diligence
will
do
in
a
short
t
that
leads
to
every
excellence
to
which
the
art
afterwards
arrived
though
he
is
introduced
in
an
argument
to
show
that
daily
food
and
nourishment
of
the
mind
of
the
artist
must
be
found
in
the
works
of
his
predecessors
there
is
something
surely
very
wavering
and
unsatisfactory
in
all
this
sir
joshua
in
another
part
of
his
work
endeavours
to
reconcile
and
prop
up
these
contradictions
by
a
paradoxical
sophism
which
i
think
turns
upon
himself
he
says
am
on
the
contrary
persuaded
that
by
imitation
only
by
which
he
has
just
explained
himself
to
mean
the
study
of
other
masters
and
even
originality
of
invention
is
produced
i
will
go
further
even
genius
at
least
what
is
so
called
is
the
child
of
imitation
but
as
this
appears
to
be
contrary
to
the
general
opinion
i
must
explain
my
position
before
i
enforce
it
is
supposed
to
be
a
power
of
producing
excellencies
which
are
out
of
the
reach
of
the
rules
of
art
a
power
which
no
precepts
can
teach
and
which
no
industry
can
acquire
opinion
of
the
impossibility
of
acquiring
those
beauties
which
stamp
the
work
with
the
character
of
genius
supposes
that
it
is
something
more
fixed
than
in
reality
it
is
and
that
we
always
do
and
ever
did
agree
in
opinion
with
respect
to
what
should
be
considered
as
the
characteristic
of
genius
but
the
truth
is
that
the
of
excellence
which
proclaims
is
different
in
different
times
and
different
places
and
what
shows
it
to
be
so
is
that
mankind
have
often
changed
their
opinion
upon
this
matter
the
arts
were
in
their
infancy
the
power
of
merely
drawing
the
likeness
of
any
object
was
considered
as
one
of
its
greatest
efforts
the
common
people
ignorant
of
the
principles
of
art
talk
the
same
language
even
to
this
day
but
when
it
was
found
that
every
man
could
be
taught
to
do
this
and
a
great
deal
more
merely
by
the
observance
of
certain
precepts
the
name
of
genius
then
shifted
its
application
and
was
given
only
to
him
who
added
the
peculiar
character
of
the
object
he
represented
to
him
who
had
invention
expression
grace
or
dignity
in
short
those
qualities
or
excellencies
the
power
of
producing
which
could
not
be
taught
by
any
known
and
promulgated
rules
are
very
sure
that
the
beauty
of
form
the
expression
of
the
passions
the
art
of
composition
even
the
power
of
giving
a
general
air
of
grandeur
to
a
work
is
at
present
very
much
under
the
dominion
of
rules
these
excellencies
were
heretofore
considered
merely
as
the
effects
of
genius
and
justly
if
genius
is
not
taken
for
inspiration
but
as
the
effect
of
close
observation
and
experience
sir
joshua
began
with
undertaking
to
show
that
was
the
child
of
the
imitation
of
others
and
now
it
turns
out
not
to
be
inspiration
indeed
but
the
effect
of
close
observation
and
experience
the
whole
drift
of
this
argument
appears
to
be
contrary
to
what
the
writer
intended
for
the
obvious
inference
is
that
the
essence
of
genius
consists
entirely
both
in
kind
and
degree
in
the
single
circumstance
of
originality
the
very
same
things
are
or
are
not
genius
according
as
they
proceed
from
invention
or
from
mere
imitation
in
so
far
as
a
thing
is
original
as
it
has
never
been
done
before
it
acquires
and
it
deserves
the
appellation
of
genius
in
so
far
as
it
is
not
original
and
is
borrowed
from
others
or
taught
by
rule
it
is
not
neither
is
it
called
genius
this
does
not
make
much
for
the
supposition
that
genius
is
a
traditional
and
quality
because
for
example
a
man
without
much
genius
can
copy
a
picture
of
michael
angelo
does
it
follow
that
there
was
no
genius
in
the
original
design
or
that
the
inventor
and
copyist
are
equal
if
indeed
as
sir
joshua
labours
to
prove
mere
imitation
of
existing
models
and
attention
to
established
rules
could
produce
results
exactly
similar
to
those
of
natural
powers
if
the
progress
of
art
as
a
learned
profession
were
a
gradual
but
continual
accumulation
of
individual
excellence
instead
of
being
a
sudden
and
almost
miraculous
start
to
the
highest
beauty
and
grandeur
nearly
at
first
and
a
regular
declension
to
mediocrity
ever
after
then
indeed
the
distinction
between
genius
and
imitation
would
be
little
worth
contending
for
the
causes
might
be
different
the
effects
would
be
the
same
or
rather
skill
to
avail
ourselves
of
external
advantages
would
be
of
more
importance
and
efficacy
than
the
most
powerful
internal
resources
but
as
the
case
stands
all
the
great
works
of
art
have
been
the
offspring
of
individual
genius
either
projecting
itself
before
the
general
advances
of
society
or
striking
out
a
separate
path
for
itself
all
the
rest
is
but
labour
in
vain
for
every
purpose
of
emulation
or
instruction
we
go
back
to
the
original
inventors
not
to
those
who
imitated
and
as
it
is
falsely
pretended
improved
upon
their
models
or
if
those
who
followed
have
at
any
time
attained
as
high
a
rank
or
surpassed
their
predecessors
it
was
not
from
borrowing
their
excellencies
but
by
unfolding
new
and
exquisite
powers
of
their
own
of
which
the
moving
principle
lay
in
the
individual
mind
and
not
in
the
stimulus
afforded
by
previous
example
and
general
knowledge
great
faults
it
is
true
may
be
avoided
but
great
excellencies
can
never
be
attained
in
this
way
if
sir
joshua
hypothesis
of
progressive
refinement
in
art
was
anything
more
than
a
verbal
fallacy
why
does
he
go
back
to
michael
angelo
as
the
god
of
his
idolatry
why
does
he
find
fault
with
carlo
maratti
for
being
heavy
or
why
does
he
declare
as
explicitly
as
truly
that
judgment
after
it
has
been
long
passive
by
degrees
loses
its
power
of
becoming
active
when
exertion
is
necessary
once
more
to
point
out
the
fluctuation
in
sir
notions
on
this
subject
of
the
advantages
of
natural
genius
and
artificial
study
he
says
when
recommending
the
proper
objects
of
ambition
to
the
young
artist
advice
in
a
word
is
this
keep
your
principal
attention
fixed
upon
the
higher
excellencies
if
you
compass
them
and
compass
nothing
more
you
are
still
in
the
first
class
we
may
regret
the
innumerable
beauties
which
you
may
want
you
may
be
very
imperfect
but
still
you
are
an
imperfect
artist
of
the
highest
order
this
is
the
fifth
discourse
in
the
seventh
our
artist
seems
to
waver
and
flings
a
doubt
on
his
former
decision
whereby
loses
some
colour
perfection
in
an
inferior
style
may
be
reasonably
preferred
to
mediocrity
in
the
highest
walks
of
art
a
landscape
of
claude
lorraine
be
preferred
to
a
history
by
luca
giordano
but
hence
appears
the
necessity
of
the
connoisseur
knowing
in
what
consists
the
excellency
of
each
class
in
order
to
judge
how
near
it
approaches
to
perfection
as
he
advances
however
he
grows
bolder
and
altogether
discards
his
theory
of
judging
of
the
artist
by
the
class
to
which
he
belongs
we
have
the
sanction
of
all
mankind
he
says
preferring
genius
in
a
lower
rank
of
art
to
feebleness
and
insipidity
in
the
highest
this
is
in
speaking
of
gainsborough
the
whole
passage
is
excellent
and
i
should
think
conclusive
against
the
general
and
factitious
style
of
art
on
which
he
insists
so
much
at
other
times
this
ground
however
unsafe
i
will
venture
to
prophesy
that
two
of
the
last
distinguished
painters
of
that
country
i
mean
pompeio
battoni
and
rafaelle
mengs
however
great
their
names
may
at
present
sound
in
our
ears
will
very
soon
fall
into
the
rank
of
imperiale
sebastian
concha
placido
constanza
musaccio
and
the
rest
of
their
immediate
predecessors
whose
names
though
equally
renowned
in
their
lifetime
are
now
fallen
into
what
is
little
short
of
total
oblivion
i
do
not
say
that
those
painters
were
not
superior
to
the
artist
i
allude
to
and
whose
loss
we
lament
in
a
certain
routine
of
practice
which
to
the
eyes
of
common
observers
has
the
air
of
a
learned
composition
and
bears
a
sort
of
superficial
resemblance
to
the
manner
of
the
great
men
who
went
before
them
i
know
this
perfectly
well
but
i
know
likewise
that
a
man
looking
for
real
and
lasting
reputation
must
unlearn
much
of
the
method
so
observable
in
the
works
of
the
artists
whom
i
have
named
for
my
own
part
i
confess
i
take
more
interest
in
and
am
more
captivated
with
the
powerful
impression
of
nature
which
gainsborough
exhibited
in
his
portraits
and
in
his
landscapes
and
the
interesting
simplicity
and
elegance
of
his
little
ordinary
than
with
any
of
the
works
of
that
school
since
the
time
of
andrea
sacchi
or
perhaps
we
may
say
carlo
maratti
two
painters
who
may
truly
be
said
to
be
ultimi
romanorum
am
well
aware
how
much
i
lay
myself
open
to
the
censure
and
ridicule
of
the
academical
professors
of
other
nations
in
preferring
the
humble
attempts
of
gainsborough
to
the
works
of
those
regular
graduates
in
the
great
historical
style
we
have
the
sanction
of
all
mankind
in
preferring
genius
in
a
lower
rank
of
art
to
feebleness
and
insipidity
in
the
highest
yet
this
excellent
artist
and
critic
had
said
but
a
few
pages
before
when
working
upon
his
theory
this
reason
i
shall
beg
leave
to
lay
before
you
a
few
thoughts
on
the
subject
to
throw
out
some
hints
that
may
lead
your
minds
to
an
opinion
which
i
take
to
be
the
true
one
that
painting
is
not
only
not
to
be
considered
as
an
imitation
operating
by
deception
but
that
it
is
and
ought
to
be
in
many
points
of
view
and
strictly
speaking
no
imitation
at
all
of
external
nature
perhaps
it
ought
to
be
as
far
removed
from
the
vulgar
idea
of
imitation
as
the
refined
civilised
state
in
which
we
live
is
removed
from
a
gross
state
of
nature
and
those
who
have
not
cultivated
their
imaginations
which
the
majority
of
mankind
certainly
have
not
may
be
said
in
regard
to
arts
to
continue
in
this
state
of
nature
such
men
will
always
prefer
imitation
the
imitation
of
nature
that
excellence
which
is
addressed
to
another
faculty
that
they
do
not
possess
but
these
are
not
the
persons
to
whom
a
painter
is
to
look
any
more
than
a
judge
of
morals
and
manners
ought
to
refer
controverted
points
upon
those
subjects
to
the
opinions
of
people
taken
from
the
banks
of
the
ohio
or
from
new
holland
in
opposition
to
the
sentiment
here
expressed
that
is
and
ought
to
be
in
many
points
of
view
and
strictly
speaking
no
imitation
at
all
of
external
nature
it
is
emphatically
said
in
another
place
is
and
must
be
the
fountain
which
alone
is
inexhaustible
and
from
which
all
excellences
must
originally
flow
i
can
not
undertake
to
reconcile
so
many
contradictions
nor
do
i
think
it
an
easy
task
for
the
student
to
derive
any
simple
or
intelligible
clue
from
these
conflicting
authorities
and
broken
hints
in
the
prosecution
of
his
art
sir
joshua
appears
to
have
imbibed
from
others
burke
or
johnson
a
spurious
metaphysical
notion
that
art
was
to
be
preferred
to
nature
and
learning
to
genius
with
which
his
own
good
sense
and
practical
observation
were
continually
at
war
but
from
which
he
only
emancipates
himself
for
a
moment
to
relapse
into
the
same
error
again
shortly
after
the
conclusion
of
the
twelfth
discourse
is
i
think
however
a
triumphant
and
unanswerable
denunciation
of
his
own
favourite
paradox
on
the
objects
and
study
of
art
artists
he
says
with
a
strain
of
eloquent
truth
have
quitted
the
service
of
nature
whose
service
when
well
understood
is
perfect
freedom
and
have
put
themselves
under
the
direction
of
i
know
not
what
capricious
fantastical
mistress
who
fascinates
and
overpowers
their
whole
mind
and
from
whose
dominion
there
are
no
hopes
of
their
being
ever
reclaimed
since
they
appear
perfectly
satisfied
and
not
at
all
conscious
of
their
forlorn
situation
like
the
transformed
followers
of
comus
not
once
perceive
their
foul
disfigurement
but
boast
themselves
more
comely
than
before
such
men
who
have
found
out
so
short
a
path
have
no
reason
to
complain
of
the
shortness
of
life
and
the
extent
of
art
since
life
is
so
much
longer
than
is
wanted
for
their
improvement
or
is
indeed
necessary
for
the
accomplishment
of
their
idea
of
perfection
on
the
contrary
he
who
recurs
to
nature
at
every
recurrence
renews
his
strength
the
rules
of
art
he
is
never
likely
to
forget
they
are
few
and
simple
but
nature
is
refined
subtle
and
infinitely
various
beyond
the
power
and
retention
of
memory
it
is
necessary
therefore
to
have
continual
recourse
to
her
in
this
intercourse
there
is
no
end
of
his
improvement
the
longer
he
lives
the
nearer
he
approaches
to
the
true
and
perfect
idea
of
art
notes
to
essay
xiii
how
careful
is
sir
joshua
even
in
a
parenthesis
to
insinuate
the
obligations
of
this
great
genius
to
others
as
if
he
would
have
been
nothing
without
them
if
sir
joshua
had
an
offer
to
exchange
a
luca
giordano
in
his
collection
for
a
claude
lorraine
he
would
not
have
hesitated
long
about
the
preference
written
in
gainsborough
sir
joshua
himself
wanted
academic
skill
and
patience
in
the
details
of
his
profession
from
these
defects
he
seems
to
have
been
alternately
repelled
by
each
theory
and
style
of
art
the
simply
natural
and
elaborately
scientific
as
it
came
before
him
and
in
his
impatience
of
each
to
have
been
betrayed
into
a
tissue
of
inconsistencies
somewhat
difficult
to
unravel
he
had
been
before
speaking
of
boucher
director
of
the
french
academy
who
told
him
that
he
was
young
studying
his
art
he
found
it
necessary
to
use
models
but
that
he
had
left
them
off
for
many
years
essay
xiv
the
same
subject
continued
the
first
inquiry
which
runs
through
sir
joshua
reynolds
discourses
is
whether
the
student
ought
to
look
at
nature
with
his
own
eyes
or
with
the
eyes
of
others
and
on
the
whole
he
apparently
inclines
to
the
latter
the
second
question
is
what
is
to
be
understood
by
nature
whether
it
is
a
general
and
abstract
idea
or
an
aggregate
of
particulars
and
he
strenuously
maintains
the
former
of
these
positions
yet
it
is
not
easy
always
to
determine
how
far
or
with
what
precise
limitations
he
does
so
the
first
germ
of
his
speculations
on
this
subject
is
to
be
found
in
two
papers
in
the
in
the
last
paragraph
of
the
second
of
these
he
says
it
has
been
proved
that
the
painter
by
attending
to
the
invariable
and
general
ideas
of
nature
produces
beauty
he
must
by
regarding
minute
particularities
and
accidental
discrimination
deviate
from
the
universal
rule
and
pollute
his
canvas
with
deformity
in
answer
to
this
i
would
say
that
deformity
is
not
the
being
varied
in
the
particulars
in
which
all
things
differ
for
on
this
principle
all
nature
which
is
made
up
of
individuals
would
be
a
heap
of
deformity
but
in
violating
general
rules
in
which
they
all
or
almost
all
agree
thus
there
are
no
two
noses
in
the
world
exactly
alike
or
without
a
great
variety
of
subordinate
parts
which
may
still
be
handsome
but
a
face
without
any
nose
at
all
or
a
nose
like
that
of
a
mask
without
any
particularity
in
the
details
would
be
a
great
deformity
in
art
or
nature
sir
joshua
seems
to
have
been
led
into
his
notions
on
this
subject
either
by
an
ambiguity
of
terms
or
by
taking
only
one
view
of
nature
he
supposes
grandeur
or
the
general
effect
of
the
whole
to
consist
in
leaving
out
the
particular
details
because
these
details
are
sometimes
found
without
any
grandeur
of
effect
and
he
therefore
conceives
the
two
things
to
be
irreconcilable
and
the
alternatives
of
each
other
this
is
very
imperfect
reasoning
if
the
mere
leaving
out
the
detail
constituted
grandeur
any
one
could
do
this
the
greatest
dauber
would
at
that
rate
be
the
greatest
artist
a
house
or
sign
painter
might
instantly
enter
the
lists
with
michael
angelo
and
might
look
down
on
the
little
dry
hard
manner
of
raphael
but
grandeur
depends
on
a
distinct
principle
of
its
own
not
on
a
negation
of
the
parts
and
as
it
does
not
arise
from
their
omission
so
neither
is
it
incompatible
with
their
insertion
or
the
highest
finishing
in
fact
an
artist
may
give
the
minute
particulars
of
any
object
one
by
one
and
with
the
utmost
care
and
totally
neglect
the
proportions
arrangement
and
general
masses
on
which
the
effect
of
the
whole
more
immediately
depends
or
he
may
give
the
latter
viz
the
proportions
and
arrangement
of
the
larger
parts
and
the
general
masses
of
light
and
shade
and
leave
all
the
minuter
parts
of
which
those
parts
are
composed
a
mere
blotch
one
general
smear
like
the
first
crude
and
hasty
getting
in
of
the
groundwork
of
a
picture
he
may
do
either
of
these
or
he
may
combine
both
that
is
finish
the
parts
but
put
them
in
their
right
places
and
keep
them
in
due
subordination
to
the
general
effect
and
massing
of
the
whole
if
the
exclusion
of
the
parts
were
necessary
to
the
grandeur
of
the
whole
composition
if
the
more
entire
this
exclusion
if
the
more
like
a
rasa
a
vague
undefined
shadowy
and
abstracted
representation
the
picture
was
the
greater
the
grandeur
there
could
be
no
danger
of
pushing
this
principle
too
far
and
going
the
full
length
of
sir
joshua
theory
without
any
restrictions
or
mental
reservations
but
neither
of
these
suppositions
is
true
the
greatest
grandeur
may
coexist
with
the
most
perfect
nay
with
a
microscopic
accuracy
of
detail
as
we
see
it
does
often
in
nature
the
greatest
looseness
and
slovenliness
of
execution
may
be
displayed
without
any
grandeur
at
all
either
in
the
outline
or
distribution
of
the
masses
of
colour
to
explain
more
particularly
what
i
mean
i
have
seen
and
copied
portraits
by
titian
in
which
the
eyebrows
were
marked
with
a
number
of
small
strokes
like
hairlines
indeed
the
hairs
of
which
they
were
composed
were
in
a
great
measure
given
but
did
this
destroy
the
grandeur
of
expression
the
truth
of
outline
arising
from
the
arrangement
of
these
in
a
given
form
the
grandeur
the
character
the
expression
remained
for
the
general
form
or
arched
and
expanded
outline
remained
just
as
much
as
if
it
had
been
daubed
in
with
a
the
introduction
of
the
internal
parts
and
texture
only
added
delicacy
and
truth
to
the
general
and
striking
effect
of
the
whole
surely
a
number
of
small
dots
or
lines
may
be
arranged
into
the
form
of
a
square
or
a
circle
indiscriminately
the
square
or
circle
that
is
the
larger
figure
remains
the
same
whether
the
line
of
which
it
consists
is
broken
or
continuous
as
we
may
see
in
prints
where
the
outlines
features
and
masses
remain
the
same
in
all
the
varieties
of
mezzotinto
dotted
and
lined
engraving
if
titian
in
marking
the
appearance
of
the
hairs
had
deranged
the
general
shape
and
contour
of
the
eyebrows
he
would
have
destroyed
the
look
of
nature
but
as
he
did
not
but
kept
both
in
view
he
proportionably
improved
his
copy
of
it
so
in
what
regards
the
masses
of
light
and
shade
the
variety
the
delicate
transparency
and
broken
transitions
of
the
tints
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
greatest
breadth
or
boldest
contrasts
if
the
light
for
instance
is
thrown
strongly
on
one
side
of
a
face
and
the
other
is
cast
into
deep
shade
let
the
individual
and
various
parts
of
the
surface
be
finished
with
the
most
scrupulous
exactness
both
in
the
drawing
and
in
the
colours
provided
nature
is
not
exceeded
this
will
not
nor
can
not
destroy
the
force
and
harmony
of
the
composition
one
side
of
the
face
will
still
have
that
great
and
leading
distinction
of
being
seen
in
shadow
and
the
other
of
being
seen
in
the
light
let
the
subordinate
differences
be
as
many
and
as
precise
as
they
will
suppose
a
panther
is
painted
in
the
sun
will
it
be
necessary
to
leave
out
the
spots
to
produce
breadth
and
the
great
style
or
will
not
this
be
done
more
effectually
by
painting
the
spots
of
one
side
of
his
shaggy
coat
as
they
are
seen
in
the
light
and
those
of
the
other
as
they
really
appear
in
natural
shadow
the
two
masses
are
thus
preserved
completely
and
no
offence
is
done
to
truth
and
nature
otherwise
we
resolve
the
distribution
of
light
and
shade
into
the
masses
the
grandeur
exist
equally
in
external
nature
with
the
local
differences
of
different
colours
yet
sir
joshua
seems
to
argue
that
the
grandeur
the
effect
of
the
whole
object
is
confined
to
the
general
idea
in
the
mind
and
that
all
the
littleness
and
individuality
is
in
nature
this
is
an
essentially
false
view
of
the
subject
this
grandeur
this
general
effect
is
indeed
always
combined
with
the
details
or
what
our
theoretical
reasoner
would
designate
as
in
nature
and
so
it
ought
to
be
in
art
as
far
as
art
can
follow
nature
with
prudence
and
profit
what
is
the
fault
of
denner
style
it
is
that
he
does
give
this
combination
of
properties
that
he
gives
only
one
view
of
nature
that
he
abstracts
the
details
the
finishing
the
curiosities
of
natural
appearances
from
the
general
result
truth
and
character
of
the
whole
and
in
finishing
every
part
with
elaborate
care
totally
loses
sight
of
the
more
important
and
striking
appearance
of
the
object
as
it
presents
itself
to
us
in
nature
he
gives
every
part
of
a
face
but
the
shape
the
expression
the
light
and
shade
of
the
whole
is
wrong
and
as
far
as
can
be
from
what
is
natural
he
gives
an
infinite
variety
of
tints
of
the
human
face
nor
are
they
subjected
to
any
principle
of
light
and
shade
he
is
different
from
rembrandt
or
titian
the
english
schools
formed
on
sir
joshua
theory
give
neither
the
finishing
of
the
parts
nor
the
effect
of
the
whole
but
an
inexplicable
dumb
mass
without
distinction
or
meaning
they
do
not
do
as
denner
did
and
think
that
not
to
do
as
he
did
is
to
do
as
titian
and
rembrandt
did
i
do
not
know
whether
they
would
take
it
as
a
compliment
to
be
supposed
to
imitate
nature
some
few
artists
it
must
be
said
have
late
reformed
this
indifferently
among
us
oh
let
them
reform
it
altogether
i
have
no
doubt
they
would
if
they
could
but
i
have
some
doubts
whether
they
can
or
before
i
proceed
to
consider
the
question
of
beauty
and
grandeur
as
it
relates
to
the
selection
of
form
i
will
quote
a
few
passages
from
sir
joshua
with
reference
to
what
has
been
said
on
the
imitation
of
particular
objects
in
the
third
discourse
he
observes
will
now
add
that
nature
herself
is
not
to
be
too
closely
copied
a
mere
copier
of
nature
never
produce
anything
great
can
never
raise
and
enlarge
the
conceptions
or
warm
the
heart
of
the
the
wish
of
the
genuine
painter
must
be
more
extensive
instead
of
endeavouring
to
amuse
mankind
with
the
minute
neatness
of
his
imitations
he
must
endeavour
to
improve
them
by
the
grandeur
of
his
ideas
instead
of
seeking
praise
by
deceiving
the
superficial
sense
of
the
spectator
he
must
strive
for
fame
by
captivating
the
imagination
from
this
passage
it
would
surely
seem
that
there
was
nothing
in
nature
but
minute
neatness
and
superficial
effect
nothing
great
in
style
for
an
imitator
of
it
can
produce
nothing
great
nothing
enlarge
the
conceptions
or
warm
the
heart
of
the
spectator
what
word
hath
passed
thy
lips
adam
severe
all
that
is
truly
grand
or
excellent
is
a
figment
of
the
imagination
a
vapid
creation
out
of
nothing
a
pure
effect
of
overlooking
and
scorning
the
minute
neatness
of
natural
objects
this
will
not
do
again
sir
joshua
lays
it
down
without
any
qualification
that
whole
beauty
and
grandeur
of
the
art
consists
in
being
able
to
get
above
all
singular
forms
local
customs
peculiarities
and
of
every
kind
yet
we
find
him
acknowledging
a
different
opinion
am
very
ready
to
allow
he
says
in
speaking
of
circumstances
of
minuteness
and
particularity
tend
to
give
an
air
of
truth
to
a
piece
and
interest
the
spectator
in
an
extraordinary
such
circumstances
therefore
can
not
wholly
be
rejected
but
if
there
be
anything
in
the
art
which
requires
peculiar
nicety
of
discernment
it
is
the
disposition
of
these
minute
circumstantial
parts
which
according
to
the
judgment
employed
in
the
choice
become
so
useful
to
truth
or
so
injurious
to
grandeur
that
true
but
the
sweeping
clause
against
particularities
and
details
of
every
kind
is
clearly
got
rid
of
the
undecided
state
of
sir
joshua
feelings
on
this
subject
of
the
incompatibility
between
the
whole
and
the
details
is
strikingly
manifested
in
two
short
passages
which
follow
each
other
in
the
space
of
two
pages
speaking
of
some
pictures
of
paul
veronese
and
rubens
as
distinguished
by
the
dexterity
and
the
unity
of
style
displayed
in
them
he
adds
is
by
this
and
this
alone
that
the
mechanical
power
is
ennobled
and
raised
much
above
its
natural
rank
and
it
appears
to
me
that
with
propriety
it
acquires
this
character
as
an
instance
of
that
superiority
with
which
mind
predominates
over
matter
by
contracting
into
one
whole
what
nature
has
made
multifarious
this
would
imply
that
the
principle
of
unity
and
integrity
is
only
in
the
mind
and
that
nature
is
a
heap
of
disjointed
disconnected
particulars
a
chaos
of
points
and
atoms
in
the
very
next
page
the
following
sentence
occurs
painting
is
an
art
they
the
ignorant
they
ought
to
be
pleased
in
proportion
as
they
see
that
art
ostentatiously
displayed
they
will
from
this
supposition
prefer
neatness
high
finishing
and
gaudy
corlouring
to
the
truth
simplicity
and
unity
of
nature
before
neatness
and
high
finishing
were
supposed
to
belong
exclusively
to
the
littleness
of
nature
but
here
truth
simplicity
and
unity
are
her
characteristics
soon
after
sir
joshua
says
should
be
sorry
if
what
has
been
said
should
be
understood
to
have
any
tendency
to
encourage
that
carelessness
which
leaves
work
in
an
unfinished
state
i
commend
nothing
for
the
want
of
exactness
i
mean
to
point
out
that
kind
of
exactness
which
is
the
best
and
which
is
alone
truly
to
be
so
esteemed
this
sir
joshua
has
already
told
us
consists
in
getting
above
particularities
and
details
of
every
kind
once
more
we
find
it
stated
that
is
in
vain
to
attend
to
the
variation
of
tints
if
in
that
attention
the
general
hue
of
flesh
is
lost
or
to
finish
ever
so
minutely
the
parts
if
the
masses
are
not
observed
or
the
whole
not
well
put
together
nothing
can
be
truer
but
why
always
suppose
the
two
things
at
variance
with
each
other
manner
was
then
new
to
the
world
but
that
unshaken
truth
on
which
it
is
founded
has
fixed
it
as
a
model
to
all
succeeding
painters
and
those
who
will
examine
into
the
artifice
will
find
it
to
consist
in
the
power
of
generalising
and
in
the
shortness
and
simplicity
of
the
means
employed
titian
real
excellence
consisted
in
the
power
of
generalising
and
of
at
the
same
time
if
it
wore
merely
the
former
it
would
be
difficult
to
account
for
the
error
immediately
after
pointed
out
by
sir
joshua
he
says
in
the
very
next
paragraph
artists
as
vasari
likewise
observes
have
ignorantly
imagined
they
are
imitating
the
manner
of
titian
when
they
leave
their
colours
rough
and
neglect
the
detail
but
not
possessing
the
principles
on
which
he
wrought
they
have
produced
what
he
calls
absurd
foolish
pictures
many
artists
have
also
imagined
they
were
following
the
directions
of
sir
joshua
when
they
did
the
same
thing
that
is
neglected
the
detail
and
produced
the
same
results
vapid
generalities
absurd
foolish
pictures
i
will
only
give
two
short
passages
more
and
have
done
with
this
part
of
the
subject
i
am
anxious
to
confront
sir
joshua
with
his
own
authority
advantage
of
this
method
of
considering
objects
as
a
whole
is
what
i
wish
now
more
particularly
to
enforce
at
the
same
time
i
do
not
forget
that
a
painter
must
have
the
power
of
contracting
as
well
as
dilating
his
sight
because
he
that
does
not
at
all
express
particulars
expresses
nothing
yet
it
is
certain
that
a
nice
discrimination
of
minute
circumstances
and
a
punctilious
delineation
of
them
whatever
excellence
it
may
have
and
i
do
not
mean
to
detract
from
it
never
did
confer
on
the
artist
the
character
of
genius
at
page
we
find
the
following
words
it
is
the
human
figure
an
animal
or
even
inanimate
objects
there
is
nothing
however
unpromising
in
appearance
but
may
be
raised
into
dignity
convey
sentiment
and
produce
emotion
in
the
hands
of
a
painter
of
genius
what
was
said
of
virgil
that
he
threw
even
the
dung
about
the
ground
with
an
air
of
dignity
may
be
applied
to
titian
whatever
he
touched
however
naturally
mean
and
habitually
familiar
by
a
kind
of
magic
he
invested
with
grandeur
and
importance
no
not
by
magic
but
by
seeking
and
finding
in
individual
nature
and
combined
with
details
of
every
kind
that
grace
and
grandeur
and
unity
of
effect
which
sir
joshua
supposes
to
be
a
mere
creation
of
the
artist
brain
titian
practice
was
i
conceive
to
give
general
appearances
with
individual
forms
and
circumstances
sir
joshua
theory
goes
too
often
and
in
its
prevailing
bias
to
separate
the
two
things
as
inconsistent
with
each
other
and
thereby
to
destroy
or
bring
into
question
that
union
of
striking
effect
with
accuracy
of
resemblance
in
which
the
essence
of
sound
art
as
far
as
relates
to
imitation
consists
farther
as
sir
joshua
is
inclined
to
merge
the
details
of
individual
objects
in
general
effect
so
he
is
resolved
to
reduce
all
beauty
or
grandeur
in
natural
objects
to
a
central
form
or
abstract
idea
of
a
certain
class
so
as
to
exclude
all
peculiarities
or
deviations
from
this
ideal
standard
as
unfit
subjects
for
the
artist
pencil
and
as
polluting
his
canvas
with
deformity
as
the
former
principle
went
to
destroy
all
exactness
and
solidity
in
particular
things
this
goes
to
confound
all
variety
distinctness
and
characteristic
force
in
the
broader
scale
of
nature
there
is
a
principle
of
conformity
in
nature
or
of
something
in
common
between
a
number
of
individuals
of
the
same
class
but
there
is
also
a
principle
of
contrast
of
discrimination
and
identity
which
is
equally
essential
in
the
system
of
the
universe
and
in
the
structure
of
our
ideas
both
of
art
and
nature
sir
joshua
would
hardly
neutralise
the
tints
of
the
rainbow
to
produce
a
dingy
grey
as
a
medium
or
central
colour
why
then
should
he
neutralise
all
features
forms
to
produce
an
insipid
monotony
he
does
not
indeed
consider
his
theory
of
beauty
as
applicable
to
colour
which
he
well
understood
but
insists
upon
and
literally
enforces
it
as
to
form
and
ideal
conceptions
of
which
he
knew
comparatively
little
and
where
his
authority
is
more
questionable
i
will
not
in
this
place
undertake
to
show
that
his
theory
of
a
middle
form
as
the
standard
of
taste
and
beauty
is
not
true
of
the
outline
of
the
human
face
and
figure
or
other
organic
bodies
though
i
think
that
even
there
it
is
only
one
principle
or
condition
of
beauty
but
i
do
say
that
it
has
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
those
other
capital
parts
of
painting
colour
character
expression
and
grandeur
of
conception
sir
joshua
himself
contends
that
in
creatures
of
the
same
species
is
the
medium
or
centre
of
all
its
various
forms
and
he
maintains
that
grandeur
is
the
same
abstraction
of
the
species
in
the
individual
therefore
beauty
and
grandeur
must
be
the
same
thing
which
they
are
not
so
that
this
definition
must
be
faulty
grandeur
i
should
suppose
to
imply
something
that
elevates
and
expands
the
mind
which
is
chiefly
power
or
magnitude
beauty
is
that
which
soothes
and
melts
it
and
its
source
i
apprehend
is
a
certain
harmony
softness
and
gradation
of
form
within
the
limits
of
our
customary
associations
no
doubt
or
of
what
we
expect
of
certain
species
but
not
independent
of
every
other
consideration
our
critic
himself
confesses
of
michael
angelo
whom
he
regards
as
the
pattern
of
the
great
or
sublime
style
that
people
are
a
superior
order
of
beings
there
is
nothing
about
them
nothing
in
the
air
of
their
actions
or
their
attitudes
or
the
style
or
cast
of
their
limbs
or
features
that
reminds
us
of
their
belonging
to
our
own
species
imagination
is
not
so
elevated
his
figures
are
not
so
much
disjoined
from
our
own
diminutive
race
of
beings
though
his
ideas
are
chaste
noble
and
of
great
conformity
to
their
subjects
michael
angelo
works
have
a
strong
peculiar
and
marked
character
they
seem
to
proceed
from
his
own
mind
entirely
and
that
mind
so
rich
and
abundant
that
he
never
needed
or
seemed
to
disdain
to
look
abroad
for
foreign
help
raffaelle
materials
are
generally
borrowed
though
the
noble
structure
is
his
own
how
does
all
this
accord
with
the
same
favourite
theory
that
all
beauty
all
grandeur
and
all
excellence
consist
in
an
approximation
to
that
central
form
or
habitual
idea
of
mediocrity
from
which
every
deviation
is
so
much
deformity
and
littleness
michael
angelo
figures
are
raised
above
our
diminutive
race
of
beings
yet
they
are
confessedly
the
standard
of
sublimity
in
what
regards
the
human
form
grandeur
then
admits
of
an
exaggeration
of
our
habitual
impressions
and
strong
marked
and
peculiar
character
which
michael
angelo
has
at
the
same
time
given
to
his
does
not
take
away
from
it
this
is
fact
against
argument
i
would
take
sir
joshua
word
for
the
goodness
of
a
picture
and
for
its
distinguishing
properties
sooner
than
i
would
for
an
abstract
metaphysical
theory
our
artist
also
speaks
continually
of
high
and
low
subjects
there
can
be
no
distinction
of
this
kind
upon
his
principle
that
the
standard
of
taste
is
the
adhering
to
the
central
form
of
each
species
and
that
every
species
is
in
itself
equally
beautiful
the
painter
of
flowers
of
shells
or
of
anything
else
is
equally
elevated
with
raphael
or
michael
if
he
adheres
to
the
generic
or
established
form
of
what
he
paints
the
rest
according
to
this
definition
is
a
matter
of
indifference
there
must
therefore
be
something
besides
the
central
or
customary
form
to
account
for
the
difference
of
dignity
for
the
high
and
low
style
in
nature
or
in
art
michael
angelo
figures
we
are
told
are
more
than
ordinarily
grand
why
by
the
same
rule
may
not
raphael
be
more
than
ordinarily
beautiful
have
more
than
ordinary
softness
symmetry
and
grace
character
and
expression
are
still
less
included
in
the
present
theory
all
character
is
a
departure
from
the
form
and
sir
joshua
makes
no
scruple
to
declare
that
expression
destroys
beauty
thus
he
says
you
mean
to
preserve
the
most
perfect
beauty
its
most
perfect
state
you
can
not
express
the
passions
all
of
which
produce
distortion
and
deformity
more
or
less
in
the
most
beautiful
faces
he
goes
on
from
want
of
choice
in
adapting
his
subject
to
his
ideas
and
his
powers
or
from
attempting
to
preserve
beauty
where
it
could
not
be
preserved
has
in
this
respect
succeeded
very
his
figures
are
often
engaged
in
subjects
that
required
great
expression
yet
his
judith
and
holofernes
the
daughter
of
herodias
with
the
baptist
head
the
andromeda
and
some
even
of
the
mothers
of
the
innocents
have
little
more
expression
than
his
venus
attired
by
the
graces
what
a
censure
is
this
passed
upon
guido
and
what
a
condemnation
of
his
own
theory
which
would
reduce
and
level
all
that
is
truly
great
and
praiseworthy
in
art
to
this
insipid
tasteless
standard
by
setting
aside
as
illegitimate
all
that
does
not
come
within
the
middle
central
form
yet
sir
joshua
judges
of
hogarth
as
he
deviates
from
this
standard
not
as
he
excels
in
individual
character
which
he
says
is
only
good
or
tolerable
as
it
partakes
of
general
nature
and
he
might
accuse
michael
angelo
and
raphael
the
one
for
his
grandeur
of
style
the
other
for
his
expression
for
neither
are
what
he
sets
up
as
the
goal
of
perfection
i
will
just
stop
to
remark
here
that
sir
joshua
has
committed
himself
very
strangely
in
speaking
of
the
character
and
expression
to
be
found
in
the
greek
statues
he
says
in
one
place
can
not
quit
the
apollo
without
making
one
observation
on
the
character
of
this
figure
he
is
supposed
to
have
just
discharged
his
arrow
at
the
python
and
by
the
head
retreating
a
little
towards
the
right
shoulder
he
appears
attentive
to
its
effect
what
i
would
remark
is
the
difference
of
this
attention
from
that
of
the
discobolus
who
is
engaged
in
the
same
purpose
watching
the
effect
of
his
discus
the
graceful
negligent
though
animated
air
of
the
one
and
the
vulgar
eagerness
of
the
other
furnish
an
instance
of
the
judgment
of
the
ancient
sculptors
their
nice
discrimination
of
they
are
both
equally
true
to
nature
and
equally
admirable
after
a
few
observations
on
the
limited
means
of
the
art
of
sculpture
and
the
inattention
of
the
ancients
to
almost
everything
but
form
we
meet
with
the
following
passage
who
think
sculpture
can
express
more
than
we
have
allowed
may
ask
by
what
means
we
discover
at
the
first
glance
the
character
that
is
represented
in
a
bust
a
cameo
or
intaglio
i
suspect
it
will
be
found
on
close
examination
by
him
who
is
resolved
not
to
see
more
than
he
really
does
see
that
the
figures
are
distinguished
by
their
more
than
by
any
variety
of
form
or
beauty
take
from
apollo
his
lyre
from
bacchus
his
thyrsus
and
and
meleager
the
boar
head
and
there
will
remain
little
or
no
difference
in
their
characters
in
a
juno
minerva
or
flora
the
idea
of
the
artist
seems
to
have
gone
no
further
than
representing
perfect
beauty
and
afterwards
adding
the
proper
attributes
with
a
total
indifference
to
which
they
gave
them
what
then
becomes
of
that
discrimination
of
character
for
which
our
author
has
just
before
celebrated
them
john
de
bologna
after
he
had
finished
a
group
of
a
young
man
holding
up
a
young
woman
in
his
arms
with
an
old
man
at
his
feet
called
his
friends
together
to
tell
him
what
name
he
should
give
it
and
it
was
agreed
to
call
it
the
rape
of
the
sabines
and
this
is
the
celebrated
group
which
now
stands
before
the
old
palace
at
florence
the
figures
have
the
same
general
expression
which
is
to
be
found
in
most
of
the
antique
sculpture
and
yet
it
would
be
no
wonder
if
future
critics
should
find
out
delicacy
of
expression
which
was
never
intended
and
go
so
far
as
to
see
in
the
old
man
countenance
the
exact
relation
which
he
bore
to
the
woman
who
appears
to
be
taken
from
him
so
it
is
that
sir
joshua
theory
seems
to
rest
on
an
inclined
plane
and
is
always
glad
of
an
excuse
to
slide
from
the
severity
of
truth
and
nature
into
the
milder
and
more
equable
regions
of
insipidity
and
inanity
i
am
sorry
to
say
so
but
so
it
appears
to
me
i
confess
it
strikes
me
as
a
truth
that
variety
or
contrast
is
as
essential
a
principle
in
art
and
nature
as
uniformity
and
as
necessary
to
make
up
the
harmony
of
the
universe
and
the
contentment
of
the
mind
who
would
destroy
the
shifting
effects
of
light
and
shade
the
sharp
lively
opposition
of
colours
in
the
same
or
in
different
objects
the
streaks
in
a
flower
the
stains
in
a
piece
of
marble
to
reduce
all
to
the
same
neutral
dead
colouring
the
same
middle
tint
yet
it
is
on
this
principle
that
sir
joshua
would
get
rid
of
all
variety
character
expression
and
picturesque
effect
in
forms
or
at
least
measure
the
worth
or
the
spuriousness
of
all
these
according
to
their
reference
to
or
departure
from
a
given
or
average
standard
surely
nature
is
more
liberal
art
is
wider
than
sir
joshua
theory
allow
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
all
forms
are
in
themselves
indifferent
and
that
beauty
or
the
sense
of
pleasure
in
forms
can
therefore
only
arise
from
customary
association
or
from
that
middle
impression
to
which
they
all
tend
yet
this
can
not
by
the
same
rule
apply
to
other
things
suppose
there
is
no
capacity
in
form
to
affect
the
mind
except
from
its
corresponding
to
previous
expectation
the
same
thing
can
not
be
said
of
the
idea
of
power
or
grandeur
no
one
can
say
that
the
idea
of
power
does
not
affect
the
mind
with
the
sense
of
awe
and
sublimity
that
is
power
and
weakness
grandeur
and
littleness
are
not
indifferent
things
the
perfection
of
which
consists
in
a
medium
between
both
again
expression
is
not
a
thing
indifferent
in
itself
which
derives
its
value
or
its
interest
solely
from
its
conformity
to
a
neutral
standard
who
would
neutralise
the
expression
of
pleasure
and
pain
or
say
that
the
passions
of
the
human
mind
pity
love
joy
sorrow
are
only
interesting
to
the
imagination
and
worth
the
attention
of
the
artist
as
he
can
reduce
them
to
an
equivocal
state
which
is
neither
pleasant
nor
painful
neither
one
thing
nor
the
other
or
who
would
stop
short
of
the
utmost
refinement
precision
and
force
in
the
delineation
of
each
ideal
expression
is
not
neutral
expression
but
extreme
expression
again
character
is
a
thing
of
peculiarity
of
striking
contrast
of
distinction
and
not
of
uniformity
it
is
necessarily
opposed
to
sir
joshua
exclusive
theory
and
yet
it
is
surely
a
curious
and
interesting
field
of
speculation
for
the
human
mind
lively
spirited
discrimination
of
character
is
one
source
of
gratification
to
the
lover
of
nature
and
art
which
it
could
not
be
if
all
truth
and
excellence
consisted
in
rejecting
individual
traits
ideal
character
is
not
but
consistent
character
marked
throughout
which
may
take
place
in
history
or
portrait
historical
truth
in
a
picture
is
the
putting
the
different
features
of
the
face
or
muscles
of
the
body
into
consistent
action
the
picturesque
altogether
depends
on
particular
points
or
qualities
of
an
object
projecting
as
it
were
beyond
the
middle
line
of
beauty
and
catching
the
eye
of
the
spectator
it
was
less
however
my
intention
to
hazard
any
speculations
of
my
own
than
to
confirm
the
feelings
on
the
subject
by
sir
joshua
own
admissions
in
different
places
in
the
tenth
discourse
speaking
of
some
objections
to
the
apollo
he
has
these
remarkable
words
regard
to
the
last
objection
viz
that
the
lower
half
of
the
figure
is
longer
than
just
proportion
allows
it
must
be
remembered
that
apollo
is
here
in
the
exertion
of
of
his
peculiar
powers
which
is
swiftness
he
has
therefore
that
proportion
which
is
best
adapted
to
that
character
this
is
no
more
incorrectness
than
when
there
is
given
to
a
hercules
an
extraordinary
swelling
and
strength
of
muscles
strength
and
activity
then
do
not
depend
on
the
middle
form
and
the
middle
form
is
to
be
sacrificed
to
the
representation
of
these
positive
qualities
character
is
thus
allowed
not
only
to
be
an
integrant
part
of
the
antique
and
classical
style
of
art
but
even
to
take
precedence
of
and
set
aside
the
abstract
idea
of
beauty
little
more
would
be
required
to
justify
hogarth
in
his
gothic
resolution
that
if
he
were
to
make
a
figure
of
charon
he
would
give
him
bandy
legs
because
watermen
are
generally
it
is
very
well
to
talk
of
the
abstract
idea
of
a
man
or
of
a
god
but
if
you
come
to
anything
like
an
intelligible
proposition
you
must
either
individualise
and
define
or
destroy
the
very
idea
you
contemplate
sir
joshua
goes
into
this
question
at
considerable
length
in
the
third
discourse
the
principle
i
have
laid
down
that
the
idea
of
beauty
in
each
species
of
beings
is
an
invariable
one
it
may
be
objected
he
says
in
every
particular
species
there
are
various
central
forms
which
are
separate
and
distinct
from
each
other
and
yet
are
undeniably
beautiful
that
in
the
human
figure
for
instance
the
beauty
of
hercules
is
one
of
the
gladiator
another
of
the
apollo
another
which
makes
so
many
different
ideas
of
beauty
it
is
true
indeed
that
these
figures
are
each
perfect
in
their
kind
though
of
different
characters
and
proportions
but
still
none
of
them
is
the
representation
of
an
individual
but
of
a
class
and
as
there
is
one
general
form
which
as
i
have
said
belongs
to
the
human
kind
at
large
so
in
each
of
these
classes
there
is
one
common
idea
which
is
the
abstract
of
the
various
individual
forms
belonging
to
that
class
thus
though
the
forms
of
childhood
and
age
differ
exceedingly
there
is
a
common
form
in
childhood
and
a
common
form
in
age
which
is
the
more
perfect
as
it
is
remote
from
all
peculiarities
but
i
must
add
further
that
though
the
most
perfect
forms
of
each
of
the
general
divisions
of
the
human
figure
are
ideal
and
superior
to
any
individual
form
of
that
class
yet
the
highest
perfection
of
the
human
figure
is
not
to
be
found
in
any
of
them
it
is
not
in
the
hercules
nor
in
the
gladiator
nor
in
the
apollo
but
in
that
form
which
is
taken
from
all
and
which
partakes
equally
of
the
activity
of
the
gladiator
of
the
delicacy
of
the
apollo
and
of
the
muscular
strength
of
the
hercules
for
perfect
beauty
in
any
species
must
combine
all
the
characters
which
are
beautiful
in
that
species
it
can
not
consist
in
any
one
to
the
exclusion
of
the
rest
no
one
therefore
must
be
predominant
that
no
one
may
be
deficient
sir
joshua
here
supposes
the
distinctions
of
classes
and
character
to
be
necessarily
combined
with
the
general
leading
idea
of
a
middle
form
this
middle
form
is
not
to
confound
age
sex
circumstance
under
one
sweeping
abstraction
but
we
must
limit
the
general
ideas
by
certain
specific
differences
and
characteristic
marks
belonging
to
the
several
subordinate
divisions
and
ramifications
of
each
class
this
is
enough
to
show
that
there
is
a
principle
of
individuality
as
well
as
of
abstraction
inseparable
from
works
of
art
as
well
as
nature
we
are
to
keep
the
human
form
distinct
from
that
of
other
living
beings
that
of
men
from
that
of
women
we
are
to
distinguish
between
age
and
infancy
between
thoughtfulness
and
gaiety
between
strength
and
softness
where
is
this
to
stop
but
sir
joshua
turns
round
upon
himself
in
this
very
passage
and
says
we
are
to
unite
the
strength
of
the
hercules
with
the
delicacy
of
the
apollo
for
perfect
beauty
in
any
species
must
combine
all
the
characters
which
are
beautiful
in
that
species
now
if
these
different
characters
are
beautiful
in
themselves
why
not
give
them
for
their
own
sakes
and
in
their
most
striking
appearances
instead
of
qualifying
and
softening
them
down
in
a
neutral
form
which
must
produce
a
compromise
not
a
union
of
different
excellences
if
all
excess
of
beauty
if
all
character
is
deformity
then
we
must
try
to
lose
it
as
fast
as
possible
in
other
qualities
but
if
strength
is
an
excellence
if
activity
is
an
excellence
if
delicacy
is
an
excellence
then
the
perfection
the
highest
degree
of
each
of
these
qualities
can
not
be
attained
but
by
remaining
satisfied
with
a
less
degree
of
the
rest
but
let
us
hear
what
sir
joshua
himself
advances
on
this
subject
in
another
part
of
the
excellences
bear
to
be
united
and
are
improved
by
union
others
are
of
a
discordant
nature
and
the
attempt
to
unite
them
only
produces
a
harsh
jarring
of
incongruent
principles
the
attempt
to
unite
contrary
excellences
of
form
for
instance
in
a
single
figure
can
never
escape
degenerating
into
the
monstrous
but
by
sinking
into
the
insipid
by
taking
away
its
marked
character
and
weakening
its
expression
as
these
remarks
appear
there
are
many
writers
on
our
art
who
not
being
of
the
profession
and
consequently
not
knowing
what
can
or
can
not
be
done
have
been
very
liberal
of
absurd
praises
in
their
description
of
favourite
works
they
always
find
in
them
what
they
are
resolved
to
find
they
praise
excellences
that
can
hardly
exist
together
and
above
all
things
are
fond
of
describing
with
great
exactness
the
expression
of
a
mixed
passion
which
more
particularly
appears
to
me
out
of
the
reach
of
our
art
are
many
disquisitions
which
i
have
read
on
some
of
the
cartoons
and
other
pictures
of
raffaelle
where
the
critics
have
described
their
own
imaginations
or
indeed
where
the
excellent
master
himself
may
have
attempted
this
expression
of
passions
above
the
powers
of
the
art
and
has
therefore
by
an
indistinct
and
imperfect
marking
left
room
for
every
imagination
with
equal
probability
to
find
a
passion
of
his
own
what
has
been
and
what
can
be
done
in
the
art
is
sufficiently
difficult
we
need
not
be
mortified
or
discouraged
at
not
being
able
to
execute
the
conceptions
of
a
romantic
imagination
art
has
its
boundaries
though
imagination
has
none
we
can
easily
like
the
ancients
suppose
a
jupiter
to
be
possessed
of
all
those
powers
and
perfections
which
the
subordinate
deities
were
endowed
with
separately
yet
when
they
employed
their
art
to
represent
him
they
confined
his
character
to
majesty
alone
pliny
therefore
though
we
are
under
great
obligations
to
him
for
the
information
he
has
given
us
in
relation
to
the
works
of
the
ancient
artists
is
very
frequently
wrong
when
he
speaks
of
them
which
he
does
very
often
in
the
style
of
many
of
our
modern
connoisseurs
he
observes
that
in
a
statue
of
paris
by
euphranor
you
might
discover
at
the
same
time
three
different
characters
the
dignity
of
a
judge
of
the
goddesses
the
lover
of
helen
and
the
conqueror
of
achilles
a
statue
in
which
you
endeavour
to
unite
stately
dignity
youthful
elegance
and
stern
valour
must
surely
possess
none
of
these
to
any
eminent
degree
hence
it
appears
that
there
is
much
difficulty
as
well
as
danger
in
an
endeavour
to
concentrate
in
a
single
subject
those
various
powers
which
rising
from
various
points
naturally
move
in
different
directions
what
real
clue
to
the
art
or
sound
principles
of
judging
the
student
can
derive
from
these
contradictory
statements
or
in
what
manner
it
is
possible
to
reconcile
them
one
to
the
other
i
confess
i
am
at
a
loss
to
discover
as
it
appears
to
me
all
the
varieties
of
nature
in
the
infinite
number
of
its
qualities
combinations
characters
expressions
incidents
rise
from
distinct
points
or
centres
and
must
move
in
distinct
directions
as
the
forms
of
different
species
are
to
be
referred
to
a
separate
standard
it
is
the
object
of
art
to
bring
them
out
in
all
their
force
clearness
and
precision
and
not
to
blend
them
into
a
vague
vapid
nondescript
conception
which
pretends
to
unite
but
in
reality
destroys
sir
joshua
theory
limits
nature
and
paralyses
art
according
to
him
the
middle
form
or
the
average
of
our
various
impressions
is
the
source
from
which
all
beauty
pleasure
interest
imagination
springs
i
contend
on
the
contrary
that
this
very
variety
is
good
in
itself
nor
do
i
agree
with
him
that
the
whole
of
nature
as
it
exists
in
fact
is
stark
naught
and
that
there
is
nothing
worthy
of
the
contemplation
of
a
wise
man
but
that
which
never
existed
in
the
world
nor
even
on
canvas
there
is
something
fastidious
and
sickly
in
sir
joshua
system
his
code
of
taste
consists
too
much
of
negations
and
not
enough
of
positive
prominent
qualities
it
accounts
for
nothing
but
the
beauty
of
the
common
antique
and
hardly
for
that
the
merit
of
hogarth
i
grant
is
different
from
that
of
the
greek
statues
but
i
deny
that
hogarth
is
to
be
measured
by
this
standard
or
by
sir
joshua
middle
forms
he
has
powers
of
instruction
and
amusement
that
from
a
different
point
naturally
move
in
a
different
direction
and
completely
attain
their
end
it
would
be
just
as
reasonable
to
condemn
a
comedy
for
not
having
the
pathos
of
a
tragedy
or
the
stateliness
of
an
epic
poem
if
sir
joshua
reynolds
theory
were
true
johnson
would
be
a
better
tragedy
than
any
of
shakespear
the
reasoning
of
the
is
i
think
then
deficient
in
the
following
particulars
it
seems
to
imply
that
general
effect
in
a
picture
is
produced
by
leaving
out
the
details
whereas
the
largest
masses
and
the
grandest
outline
are
consistent
with
the
utmost
delicacy
of
finishing
in
the
parts
it
makes
no
distinction
between
beauty
and
grandeur
but
refers
both
to
an
or
middle
form
as
the
centre
of
the
various
forms
of
the
species
and
yet
inconsistently
attributes
the
grandeur
of
michael
angelo
style
to
the
superhuman
appearance
of
his
prophets
and
apostles
it
does
not
at
any
time
make
mention
of
power
or
magnitude
in
an
object
as
a
distinct
source
of
the
sublime
though
this
is
acknowledged
unintentionally
in
the
case
of
michael
angelo
etc
nor
of
softness
or
symmetry
of
form
as
a
distinct
source
of
beauty
independently
of
though
still
in
connection
with
another
source
arising
from
what
we
are
accustomed
to
expect
from
each
individual
species
sir
joshua
theory
does
not
leave
room
for
character
but
rejects
it
as
an
anomaly
it
does
not
point
out
the
source
of
expression
but
considers
it
as
hostile
to
beauty
and
yet
lastly
he
allows
that
the
middle
form
carried
to
the
utmost
theoretical
extent
neither
defined
by
character
nor
impregnated
by
passion
would
produce
nothing
but
vague
insipid
unmeaning
generality
in
a
word
i
can
not
think
that
the
theory
here
laid
down
is
clear
and
satisfactory
that
it
is
consistent
with
itself
that
it
accounts
for
the
various
excellences
of
art
from
a
few
simple
principles
or
that
the
method
which
sir
joshua
has
pursued
in
treating
the
subject
is
as
he
himself
expresses
it
plain
and
honest
method
it
is
i
fear
more
calculated
to
baffle
and
perplex
the
student
in
his
progress
than
to
give
him
clear
lights
as
to
the
object
he
should
have
in
view
or
to
furnish
him
with
strong
motives
of
emulation

attain

could
be
expressed

essay

on
paradox
and
i
have
been
sometimes
accused
of
a
fondness
for
paradoxes
but
i
can
not
in
my
own
mind
plead
guilty
to
the
charge
i
do
not
indeed
swear
by
an
opinion
because
it
is
old
but
neither
do
i
fall
in
love
with
every
extravagance
at

sight

it
is
new

conceive
that
a
thing
may
have
been
repeated
a
thousand
times
without
being
a
bit
more
reasonable
than
it
was
the
first
time
and
i
also
conceive
that
an
argument
or
an
observation
may
be
very
just
though
it
may
so
happen
that
it
was
never
stated
before
but
i
do
not
take
it
for
granted
that
every
prejudice
is
nor
that
every
paradox
is
merely
because
it
contradicts
the
vulgar
opinion
sheridan
once
said
of
some
speech
in
his
acute
sarcastic
way
that
contained
a
great
deal
both
of
what
was
new
and
what
was
true
but
that
unfortunately
what
was
new
was
not
true
and
what
was
true
was
not
new
this
appears
to
me
to
express
the
whole
sense
of
the
question
i
do
not
see
much
use
in
dwelling
on
a
however
fashionable
or
well
established
nor
am
i
very
ambitious
of
starting
the
most
specious
novelty
unless
i
imagine
i
have
reason
on
my
side
originality
implies
independence
of
opinion
but
differs
as
widely
from
mere
singularity
as
from
the
tritest
truism
it
consists
in
seeing
and
thinking
for
whereas
singularity
is
only
the
affectation
of
saying
something
to
contradict
other
people
without
having
any
real
opinion
of
one

utterly
incapable
of

except
from
the

opposed
to

there
is

in

are

under

out
the

he
is

as
is
often
observable
in
the
case
of
religious
enthusiasts
there
is
a
slenderness
of
constitutional
stamina
which
renders
the
flesh
no

for
the

his
bending
flexible
form
appears
to
take
no
strong
hold
of
things
does
not
grapple
with
the
world
about
him
but
slides
from
it
like
a

in
its
liquid
texture
mortal
wound
receives
no
more
than
can
the
fluid
air
the
shock
of
accident
the
weight
of
authority
make
no
impression
on
his
opinions
which
retire
like
a
feather
or
rise
from
the
encounter
unhurt
through
their
own
buoyancy
he
is
clogged
by
no
dull
system
of
realities
no
feelings
no
rooted
prejudices
by
nothing
that
belongs
to
the
mighty
trunk
and
hard
husk
of
nature
and
habit
but
is
drawn
up
by
irresistible
levity
to
the
regions
of
mere
speculation
and
fancy
to
the
sphere
of
air
and
fire
where
his
delighted
spirit
floats
in
of
pearl
and
clouds
of
amber
there
is
no
of
threadbare
experience
to
serve
as
ballast
to
his

it

volatile
intellectual
salt
of
tartar
that
refuses
to
combine
its
evanescent
inflammable
essence
with
anything
solid

anything
lasting
bubbles
are
to
him
the
only
realities
touch
them
and
they
vanish
curiosity
is
the
only
proper
category
of
his
mind
and
though
a
man
in
knowledge
he
is
a
child
in
feeling
hence
he
puts
everything
into
a
metaphysical
crucible
to
judge
of
it
himself
and
exhibit
it
to
others
as
a
subject
of
interesting
experiment
without
first
making
it
over
to
the
ordeal
of
his
common
sense
or
trying
it
on
his
heart
this
faculty
of
speculating
at
random
on
all
questions
may
in
its
overgrown

uninformed
state
do
much
mischief
without

this
levity

not

and
systems
but
this
is
in
him
an
effect
of
constitution
he
runs
before
the
most
extravagant
opinions
but
this
is
because
he
is
held
back
by
none
of
the
merely
mechanical
checks
of
sympathy
and
habit
he
tampers
with
all
sorts
of
obnoxious
subjects
but
it
is
less
because
he
is
gratified
with
the
rankness
of
the
taint
than
captivated
with
the
intellectual
phosphoric
light
they
emit
it
would
seem
that
he
wished
not
so
much
to
convince
or
inform
as
to
shock
the
public
by
the
tenor
of
his
productions
but
i
suspect
he
is
more
intent
upon
startling
himself
with
his
electrical
experiments
in
morals
and
philosophy
and
though
they
may
scorch
other
people
they
are
to
him
harmless
amusements
the
coruscations
of
an
aurora
borealis
that
round
the
head
but
do
not
reach
the
heart
still
i
could
wish
that
he
would
put
a
stop
to
the
incessant
alarming
whirl
of
his
voltaic
battery
with
his
zeal
his
talent
and
his
fancy
he
would
do
more
good
and
less
harm
if
he
were
to
give
up
his
wilder
theories
and
if
he
took
less
pleasure
in
feeling
his
heart
flutter
in
unison
with
the
apprehensions
of
his
readers
persons
of
this
class
instead
of
consolidating
useful
and
acknowledged
truths
and
thus
advancing
the
cause
of
science
and
virtue
are
never
easy
but
in
raising
doubtful
and
disagreeable
questions
which
bring
the
former
into
disgrace
and
discredit
they
are
not
contented
to
lead
the
minds
of
men
to
an
eminence
overlooking
the
prospect
of
social
amelioration
unless
by
forcing
them
up
slippery
paths
and
to
the
utmost
verge
of
possibility
they
can
dash
them
down
the
precipice
the
instant
they
reach
the
promised
pisgah
they
think
it
nothing
to
hang
up
a
beacon
to
guide
or
warn
if
they
do
not
at
the
same
time
frighten
the
community
like
a
comet
they
do
not
mind
making
their
principles
odious
provided
they
can
make
themselves
notorious
to
win
over
the
public
opinion
by
fair
means
is
to
them
an
insipid
mode
of
popularity
they
would
either
force
it
by
harsh
methods
or
seduce
it
by
intoxicating
potions
egotism
petulance
licentiousness
levity
of
principle
whatever
be
the
source
is
a
bad
thing
in
any
one
and
most
of
all
in
a
philosophical
reformer
their
humanity
their
wisdom
is
always
the
horizon
anything
new
anything
remote
anything
questionable
comes
to
them
in
a
shape
that
is
sure
of
a
cordial
welcome
a
welcome
cordial
in
proportion
as
the
object
is
new
as
it
is
apparently
impracticable
as
it
is
a
doubt
whether
it
is
at
all
desirable
just
after
the
final
failure
the
completion
of
the
last
act
of
the
french
revolution
when
the
legitimate
wits
were
crying
out
farce
is
over
now
let
us
go
to
supper
these
provoking
reasoners
got
up
a
lively
hypothesis
about
introducing
the
domestic
government
of
the
nayrs
into
this
country
as
a
feasible
against
the
success
of
the
the
practical
is
with
them
always
the
antipodes
of
the
ideal
and
like
other
visionaries
of
a
different
stamp
they
date
the
millennium
or
new
order
of
things
from
the
restoration
of
the
bourbons
words
butter
no
parsnips
says
the
proverb
you
are
talking
of
marrying
i
am
thinking
of
hanging
says
captain
macheath
of
all
people
the
most
tormenting
are
those
who
bid
you
hope
in
the
midst
of
despair
who
by
never
caring
about
anything
but
their
own
sanguine
utopian
schemes
have
at
no
time
any
particular
cause
for
embarrassment
and
despondency
because
they
have
never
the
least
chance
of
success
and
who
by
including
whatever
does
not
hit
their
idle
fancy
kings
priests
religion
government
public
abuses
or
private
morals
in
the
same
sweeping
clause
of
ban
and
anathema
do
all
they
can
to
combine
all
parties
in
a
common
cause
against
them
and
to
prevent
every
one
else
from
advancing
one
step
farther
in
the
career
of
practical
improvement
than
they
do
in
that
of
imaginary
and
unattainable
perfection
besides
all
this
untoward
heat
and
precocity
often
argues
rottenness
and
a
i
myself
remember
several
instances
of
this
sort
of
unrestrained
license
of
opinion
and
violent
effervescence
of
sentiment
in
the
first
period
of
the
french
revolution
extremes
meet
and
the
most
furious
anarchists
have
since
become
the
most
barefaced
apostates
among
the
foremost
of
these
i
might
mention
the
present
and
some
of
his
friends
the
on
that
side
of
the
question
godwin
bentham
have
not
turned
round
in
this
extraordinary
manner
they
seem
to
have
felt
their
ground
however
mistaken
in
some
points
and
have
in
general
adhered
to
their
first
principles
but
as
it
has
been
said
have
seething
brains
that
they
are
disposed
to
meddle
with
everything
and
mar
all
they
make
bad
philosophers
and
worse
politicians
they
live
for
the
most
part
in
an
ideal
world
of
their
own
and
it
would
perhaps
be
as
well
if
they
were
confined
to
it
their
flights
and
fancies
are
delightful
to
themselves
and
to
everybody
else
but
they
make
strange
work
with
matter
of
fact
and
if
they
were
allowed
to
act
in
public
affairs
would
soon
turn
the
world
the
wrong
side
out
they
indulge
only
their
own
flattering
dreams
or
superstitious
prejudices
and
make
idols
or
bugbears
of
whatever
they
please
caring
as
little
for
history
or
particular
facts
as
for
general
reasoning
they
are
dangerous
leaders
and
treacherous
followers
their
inordinate
vanity
runs
them
into
all
sorts
of
extravagances
and
their
habitual
effeminacy
gets
them
out
of
them
at
any
price
always
pampering
their
own
appetite
for
excitement
and
wishing
to
astonish
others
their
whole
aim
is
to
produce
a
dramatic
effect
one
way
or
other
to
shock
or
delight
the
observers
and
they
are
apparently
as
indifferent
to
the
consequences
of
what
they
write
as
if
the
world
were
merely
a
stage
for
them
to
play
their
fantastic
tricks
on
and
to
make
their
admirers
weep
not
less
romantic
in
their
servility
than
their
independence
and
equally
importunate
candidates
for
fame
or
infamy
they
require
only
to
be
distinguished
and
are
not
scrupulous
as
to
the
means
of
distinction
jacobins
or
outrageous
advocates
for
anarchy
and
licentiousness
or
flaming
apostles
of
political
persecution
always
violent
and
vulgar
in
their
opinions
they
oscillate
with
a
giddy
and
sickening
motion
from
one
absurdity
to
another
and
expiate
the
follies
of
youth
by
the
heartless
vices
of
advancing
age
none
so
ready
as
they
to
carry
every
paradox
to
its
most
revolting
and
ridiculous
excess
none
so
sure
to
caricature
in
their
own
persons
every
feature
of
the
prevailing
philosophy
in
their
days
of
blissful
innovation
indeed
the
philosophers
crept
at
their
heels
like
hounds
while
they
darted
on
their
distant
quarry
like
hawks
stooping
always
to
the
lowest
game
eagerly
snuffing
up
the
most
tainted
and
rankest
scents
feeding
their
vanity
with
a
notion
of
the
strength
of
their
digestion
of
poisons
and
most
ostentatiously
avowing
whatever
would
most
effectually
startle
the
prejudices
of
others
preposterously
seeking
for
the
stimulus
of
novelty
in
abstract
truth
and
the
eclat
of
theatrical
exhibition
in
pure
reason
it
is
no
wonder
that
these
persons
at
last
became
disgusted
with
their
own
pursuits
and
that
in
consequence
of
the
violence
of
the
change
the
most
inveterate
prejudices
and
uncharitable
sentiments
have
rushed
in
to
fill
up
the
void
produced
by
the
previous
annihilation
of
common
sense
wisdom
and
humanity
i
have
so
far
been
a
little
hard
on
poets
and
reformers
lest
i
should
be
thought
to
have
taken
a
particular
spite
to
them
i
will
try
to
make
them
the
by
turning
to
a
passage
in
the
writings
of
one
who
neither
is
nor
ever
pretended
to
be
a
poet
or
a
reformer
but
the
antithesis
of
both
an
accomplished
man
of
the
world
a
courtier
and
a
wit
and
who
has
endeavoured
to
move
the
previous
question
on
all
schemes
of
fanciful
improvement
and
all
plans
of
practical
reform
by
the
following
declaration
it
is
in
itself
a
finished
and
may
serve
as
a
test
whether
that
sort
of
smooth
verbal
reasoning
which
passes
current
because
it
excites
no
one
idea
in
the
mind
is
much
freer
from
inherent
absurdity
than
the
wildest
paradox
lot
says
canning
in
the
conclusion
of
his
liverpool
speech
cast
under
the
british
monarchy
under
that
i
have
lived
under
that
i
have
seen
my
country
flourish
under
that
i
have
seen
it
enjoy
as
great
a
share
of
prosperity
of
happiness
and
of
glory
as
i
believe
any
modification
of
human
society
to
be
capable
of
bestowing
and
i
am
not
prepared
to
sacrifice
or
to
hazard
the
fruit
of
centuries
of
experience
of
centuries
of
struggles
and
of
more
than
one
century
of
liberty
as
perfect
as
ever
blessed
any
country
upon
the
earth
for
visionary
schemes
of
ideal
perfectibility
for
doubtful
experiments
even
of
possible
improvement
such
is
canning
and
in
giving
the
following
answer
to
it
i
do
not
think
i
can
be
accused
of
falling
into
that
extravagant
and
unmitigated
strain
of
paradoxical
reasoning
with
which
i
have
already
found
so
much
fault
the
passage
then
which
the
gentleman
here
throws
down
as
an
effectual
bar
to
all
change
to
all
innovation
to
all
improvement
contains
at
every
step
a
refutation
of
his
favourite
creed
he
is
not
to
sacrifice
or
to
hazard
the
fruit
of
centuries
of
experience
of
centuries
of
struggles
and
of
one
century
of
liberty
for
visionary
schemes
of
ideal
perfectibility
so
here
are
centuries
of
experience
and
centuries
of
struggles
to
arrive
at
one
century
of
liberty
and
yet
according
to
canning
general
advice
we
are
never
to
make
any
experiments
or
to
engage
in
any
struggles
either
with
a
view
to
future
improvement
or
to
recover
benefits
which
we
have
lost
man
they
repeat
in
our
cars
line
upon
line
precept
upon
precept
is
always
to
turn
his
back
upon
the
future
and
his
face
to
the
past
he
is
to
believe
that
nothing
is
possible
or
desirable
but
what
he
finds
already
established
to
his
hands
in
institutions
or
inveterate
abuses
his
unde
to
be
made
into
a
political
automaton
a
of
superstition
and
prejudice
never
stirring
hand
or
foot
but
as
he
is
pulled
by
the
wires
and
strings
of
the
the
legitimate
managers
and
proprietors
of
the
show
his
powers
of
will
of
thought
and
action
are
to
be
paralysed
in
him
and
he
is
to
be
told
and
to
believe
that
whatever
is
must
be
perhaps
canning
will
say
that
men
were
to
make
experiments
and
to
resolve
upon
struggles
formerly
but
that
now
they
are
to
surrender
their
understandings
and
their
rights
into
his
keeping
but
at
what
period
of
the
world
was
the
system
of
political
wisdom
like
cobbett
against
paper
so
as
to
admit
of
no
farther
alterations
or
improvements
or
correction
of
errors
of
the
press
when
did
the
experience
of
mankind
become
stationary
or
retrograde
so
that
we
must
act
from
the
obsolete
inferences
of
past
periods
not
from
the
living
impulse
of
existing
circumstances
and
the
consolidated
force
of
the
knowledge
and
reflection
of
ages
up
to
the
present
instant
naturally
projecting
us
forward
into
the
future
and
not
driving
us
back
upon
the
past
did
canning
never
hear
did
he
never
think
of
lord
bacon
axiom
those
times
are
the
ancient
times
in
which
we
live
and
not
those
which
counting
backwards
from
ourselves
retrogrado
we
call
ancient
the
latest
periods
must
necessarily
have
the
advantage
of
the
of
the
experience
that
has
gone
before
them
and
of
the
of
human
reason
exerted
upon
that
experience
or
upon
the
solid
foundation
of
nature
and
history
moving
on
in
its
majestic
course
not
fluttering
in
the
empty
air
of
fanciful
speculation
nor
leaving
a
gap
of
centuries
between
us
and
the
grounds
on
which
we
are
to
think
and
act
canning
can
not
plead
with
burke
that
no
discoveries
no
improvements
have
been
made
in
political
science
and
institutions
for
he
says
we
have
arrived
through
centuries
of
experience
and
of
struggles
at
one
century
of
liberty
is
the
world
then
at
a
stand
canning
knows
well
enough
that
it
is
in
ceaseless
progress
and
everlasting
change
but
he
would
have
it
to
be
the
change
from
liberty
to
slavery
the
progress
of
corruption
not
of
regeneration
and
reform
why
no
longer
ago
than
the
present
year
the
two
epochs
of
november
and
january
last
presented
he
tells
us
in
this
very
speech
as
great
a
contrast
in
the
state
of
the
country
as
any
two
periods
of
its
history
the
most
opposite
or
most
remote
well
then
are
our
experience
and
our
struggles
at
an
end
no
he
says
crisis
is
at
hand
for
every
man
to
take
part
for
or
against
the
institutions
of
the
british
monarchy
his
part
is
taken
of
this
be
sure
to
do
aught
good
will
never
be
his
task
he
will
guard
carefully
against
all
possible
improvements
and
maintain
all
possible
abuses
sacred
impassive
immortal
he
will
not
give
up
the
fruit
of
centuries
of
experience
of
struggles
and
of
one
century
at
least
of
liberty
since
the
revolution
of
for
any
doubtful
experiments
whatever
we
are
arrived
at
the
end
of
our
experience
our
struggles
and
our
liberty
and
are
to
anchor
through
time
and
eternity
in
the
harbour
of
passive
obedience
and
we
the
people
of
england
will
tell
canning
frankly
what
we
think
of
his
magnanimous
and
ulterior
resolution
it
is
our
own
and
it
has
been
the
resolution
of
mankind
in
all
ages
of
the
world
no
people
no
age
ever
threw
away
the
fruits
of
past
wisdom
or
the
enjoyment
of
present
blessings
for
visionary
schemes
of
ideal
perfection
it
is
the
knowledge
of
the
past
the
actual
infliction
of
the
present
that
has
produced
all
changes
all
innovations
and
all
improvements
not
as
is
pretended
the
chimerical
anticipation
of
possible
advantages
but
the
intolerable
pressure
of
notorious
aggravated
and
growing
abuses
it
was
the
experience
of
the
enormous
and
disgusting
abuses
and
corruptions
of
the
papal
power
that
produced
the
reformation
it
was
the
experience
of
the
vexations
and
oppressions
of
the
feudal
system
that
produced
its
abolition
after
centuries
of
sufferings
and
of
struggles
it
was
the
experience
of
the
caprice
and
tyranny
of
the
monarch
that
extorted
at
runnymede
it
was
the
experience
of
the
arbitrary
and
insolent
abuse
of
the
prerogative
in
the
reigns
of
the
tudors
and
the
first
stuarts
that
produced
the
resistance
to
it
in
the
reign
of
charles
and
the
grand
rebellion
it
was
the
experience
of
the
incorrigible
attachment
of
the
same
stuarts
to
popery
and
slavery
with
their
many
acts
of
cruelty
treachery
and
bigotry
that
produced
the
revolution
and
set
the
house
of
brunswick
on
the
throne
it
was
the
conviction
of
the
incurable
nature
of
the
abuse
increasing
with
time
and
patience
and
overcoming
the
obstinate
attachment
to
old
habits
and
prejudices
an
attachment
not
to
be
rooted
out
by
fancy
or
theory
but
only
by
repeated
lasting
and
incontrovertible
proofs
that
has
abated
every
nuisance
that
ever
was
abated
and
introduced
every
innovation
and
every
example
of
revolution
and
reform
it
was
the
experience
of
the
abuses
licentiousness
and
innumerable
oppressions
of
the
old
government
in
france
that
produced
the
french
revolution
it
was
the
experience
of
the
determination
of
the
british
ministry
to
harass
insult
and
plunder
them
that
produced
the
revolution
of
the
united
states
away
then
with
this
miserable
cant
against
fanciful
theories
and
appeal
to
acknowledged
experience
men
never
act
against
their
prejudices
but
from
the
spur
of
their
feelings
the
necessity
of
their
situations
their
theories
are
adapted
to
their
practical
convictions
and
their
varying
circumstances
nature
has
ordered
it
so
and
canning
by
showing
off
his
rhetorical
paces
by
his
and
lisping
and
nicknaming
god
creatures
can
not
invert
that
order
efface
the
history
of
the
past
or
arrest
the
progress
of
the
public
opinion
is
the
result
of
public
events
and
public
feelings
and
government
must
be

these

the

fall
no

was
montgomery
the
ingenious

amiable
poet
after
he
had
been
shut
up
in
solitary
confinement
for
a
year
and
a
half
for
printing
the
duke
of
richmond
letter
on
reform
when
he
first
walked
out
into
the
narrow
path
of
the
adjoining
field
was
seized
with
an
apprehension
that
he
should
fall
over
it
as
if
he
had
trod
on
the
brink
of
an
abrupt
declivity
the
author
of
the
loyal
speech
at
the
liverpool
dinner
has
been
so
long
kept
in
the
solitary
confinement
of
his
prejudices
and
the
dark
cells
of
his
interest
and
vanity
that
he
is
afraid
of
being
dashed
to
pieces
if
he
makes
a
single
false
step
to
the
right
or
the
left
from
his
dangerous
and
crooked
policy
as
to
himself
his
ears
are
no
doubt
closed
to
any
advice
that
might
here
be
offered
him
and
as
to
his
country
he
seems
bent
on
its
destruction
if
however
an
example
of
the
futility
of
all
his
projects
and
all
his
reasonings
on
a
broader
scale
warn
and
scare
be
wanting
let
him
look
at
spain
and
take
leisure
to
recover
from
his
incredulity
and
his
surprise

fallen

pernicious

years

i
remember
being
present
in
a
large
party
composed
of
men
women
and
children
in
which
two
persons
of
remarkable
candour
and
ingenuity
were
labouring
as
hard
as
if
they
had
been
paid
for
it
to
prove
that
all
prayer
was
a
mode
of
dictating
to
the
almighty
and
an
arrogant
assumption
of
superiority
a
gentleman
present
said
with
great
simplicity
and
that
there
was
one
prayer
which
did
not
strike
him
as
coming
exactly
under
this
description
and
being
asked
what
that
was
made
answer

this
appeal
by
no

settled
the
sceptical
dogmatism
of
the
two
disputants

soon
after
the
proposer
of
the
objection
went
away

one
of

observed
with
great
marks
of
satisfaction

essay
xvi
on
vulgarity
and
affectation
few
subjects
are
more
nearly
allied
than
these
two
vulgarity
and
affectation
it
may
be
said
of
them
truly
that
partitions
do
their
bounds
divide
there
can
not
be
a
surer
proof
of
a
low
origin
or
of
an
innate
meanness
of
disposition
than
to
be
always
talking
and
thinking
of
being
genteel
one
must
feel
a
strong
tendency
to
that
which
one
is
always
trying
to
avoid
whenever
we
pretend
on
all
occasions
a
mighty
contempt
for
anything
it
is
a
pretty
clear
sign
that
we
feel
ourselves
very
nearly
on
a
level
with
it
of
the
two
classes
of
people
i
hardly
know
which
is
to
be
regarded
with
most
distaste
the
vulgar
aping
the
genteel
or
the
genteel
constantly
sneering
at
and
endeavouring
to
distinguish
themselves
from
the
vulgar
these
two
sets
of
persons
are
always
thinking
of
one
another
the
lower
of
the
higher
with
envy
the
more
fortunate
of
their
less
happy
neighbours
with
contempt
they
are
habitually
placed
in
opposition
to
each
other
jostle
in
their
pretensions
at
every
turn
and
the
same
objects
and
train
of
thought
only
reversed
by
the
relative
situation
of
either
party
occupy
their
whole
time
and
attention
the
one
are
straining
every
nerve
and
outraging
common
sense
to
be
thought
genteel
the
others
have
no
other
object
or
idea
in
their
heads
than
not
to
be
thought
vulgar
this
is
but
poor
spite
a
very
pitiful
style
of
ambition
to
be
merely
not
that
which
one
heartily
despises
is
a
very
humble
claim
to
superiority
to
despise
what
one
really
is
is
still
worse
most
of
the
characters
in
miss
burney
novels
the
branghtons
the
smiths
the
dubsters
the
cecilias
the
delvilles
are
well
met
in
this
respect
and
much
of
a
piece
the
one
half
are
trying
not
to
be
taken
for
themselves
and
the
other
half
not
to
be
taken
for
the
first
they
neither
of
them
have
any
pretensions
of
their
own
or
real
standard
of
worth
feather
will
turn
the
scale
of
their
avoirdupois
though
the
fair
authoress
was
not
aware
of
the
metaphysical
identity
of
her
principal
and
subordinate
characters
affectation
is
the
to
both
gentility
is
only
a
more
select
and
artificial
kind
of
vulgarity
it
can
not
exist
but
by
a
sort
of
borrowed
distinction
it
plumes
itself
up
and
revels
in
the
homely
pretensions
of
the
mass
of
mankind
it
judges
of
the
worth
of
everything
by
name
fashion
and
opinion
and
hence
from
the
conscious
absence
of
real
qualities
or
sincere
satisfaction
in
itself
it
builds
its
supercilious
and
fantastic
conceit
on
the
wretchedness
and
wants
of
others
violent
antipathies
are
always
suspicious
and
betray
a
secret
affinity
the
difference
between
the
vulgar
and
the
small
is
mostly
in
outward
circumstances
the
coxcomb
criticises
the
dress
of
the
clown
as
the
pedant
cavils
at
the
bad
grammar
of
the
illiterate
or
the
prude
is
shocked
at
the
backslidings
of
her
frail
acquaintance
those
who
have
the
fewest
resources
in
themselves
naturally
seek
the
food
of
their
elsewhere
the
most
ignorant
people
find
most
to
laugh
at
in
strangers
scandal
and
satire
prevail
most
in
and
a
propensity
to
ridicule
every
the
slightest
or
most
palpable
deviation
from
what
we
happen
to
approve
ceases
with
the
progress
of
common
sense
and
decency
true
worth
does
not
exult
in
the
faults
and
deficiencies
of
others
as
true
refinement
turns
away
from
grossness
and
deformity
instead
of
being
tempted
to
indulge
in
an
unmanly
triumph
over
it
raphael
would
not
faint
away
at
the
daubing
of
a
signpost
nor
homer
hold
his
head
the
higher
for
being
in
the
company
of
a
grub
street
bard
real
power
real
excellence
does
not
seek
for
a
foil
in
inferiority
nor
fear
contamination
from
coming
in
contact
with
that
which
is
coarse
and
homely
it
reposes
on
itself
and
is
equally
free
from
spleen
and
affectation
but
the
spirit
of
gentility
is
the
mere
essence
of
spleen
and
affectation
of
affected
delight
in
its
own
qualifications
and
of
ineffable
disdain
poured
out
upon
the
involuntary
blunders
or
accidental
disadvantages
of
those
whom
it
chooses
to
treat
as
its
inferiors
thus
a
fashionable
miss
titters
till
she
is
ready
to
burst
her
sides
at
the
uncouth
shape
of
a
bonnet
or
the
abrupt
drop
of
a
curtsey
such
as
jeanie
deans
would
make
in
a
who
comes
to
be
hired
by
her
mamma
as
a
servant
yet
to
show
how
little
foundation
there
is
for
this
hysterical
expression
of
her
extreme
good
opinion
of
herself
and
contempt
for
the
untutored
rustic
she
would
herself
the
next
day
be
delighted
with
the
very
same
shaped
bonnet
if
brought
her
by
a
french
milliner
and
told
it
was
all
the
fashion
and
in
a
week
time
will
become
quite
familiar
with
the
maid
and
chatter
with
her
upon
equal
terms
about
caps
and
ribbons
and
lace
by
the
hour
together
there
is
no
difference
between
them
but
that
of
situation
in
the
kitchen
or
in
the
parlour
let
circumstances
bring
them
together
and
they
fit
like
hand
and
glove
it
is
like
mistress
like
maid
their
talk
their
thoughts
their
dreams
their
likings
and
dislikes
are
the
same
the
mistress
head
runs
continually
on
dress
and
finery
so
does
the
maid
the
young
lady
longs
to
ride
in
a
coach
and
six
so
does
the
maid
if
she
could
miss
forms
a
of
a
lover
with
black
eyes
and
rosy
cheeks
which
does
not
differ
from
that
of
her
attendant
both
like
a
smart
man
the
one
the
footman
and
the
other
his
master
for
the
same
reason
both
like
handsome
furniture
and
fine
houses
both
apply
the
terms
shocking
and
disagreeable
to
the
same
things
and
persons
both
have
a
great
notion
of
balls
plays
treats
and
both
like
a
wedding
or
a
christening
and
both
would
give
their
little
fingers
to
see
a
coronation
with
this
difference
that
the
one
has
a
chance
of
getting
a
seat
at
it
and
the
other
is
dying
with
envy
that
she
has
not
indeed
this
last
is
a
ceremony
that
delights
equally
the
greatest
monarch
and
the
meanest
of
his
subjects
the
vilest
of
the
rabble
yet
this
which
is
the
height
of
gentility
and
consummation
of
external
distinction
and
splendour
is
i
should
say
a
vulgar
ceremony
for
what
degree
of
refinement
of
capacity
of
virtue
is
required
in
the
individual
who
is
so
distinguished
or
is
necessary
to
his
enjoying
this
idle
and
imposing
parade
of
his
person
is
he
delighted
with
the
and
gilded
panels
so
is
the
poorest
wretch
that
gazes
at
it
is
he
struck
with
the
spirit
the
beauty
and
symmetry
of
the
eight
horses
there
is
not
one
of
the
immense
multitude
who
flock
to
see
the
sight
from
town
or
country
giles
or
whitechapel
young
or
old
rich
or
poor
gentle
or
simple
who
does
not
agree
to
admire
the
same
object
is
he
delighted
with
the
yeomen
of
the
guard
the
military
escort
the
groups
of
ladies
the
badges
of
sovereign
power
the
kingly
crown
the
marshal
truncheon
and
the
judge
robe
the
array
that
precedes
and
follows
him
the
crowded
streets
the
windows
hung
with
eager
looks
so
are
the
mob
for
they
eyes
and
see
them
there
is
no
one
faculty
of
mind
or
body
natural
or
acquired
essential
to
the
principal
figure
in
this
procession
more
than
is
common
to
the
meanest
and
most
despised
attendant
on
it
a
waxwork
figure
would
answer
the
same
purpose
a
lord
mayor
of
london
has
as
much
tinsel
to
be
proud
of
i
would
rather
have
a
king
do
something
that
no
one
else
has
the
power
or
magnanimity
to
do
or
say
something
that
no
one
else
has
the
wisdom
to
say
or
look
more
handsome
more
thoughtful
or
benign
than
any
one
else
in
his
dominions
but
i
see
nothing
to
raise
idea
of
him
in
his
being
made
a
show
of
if
the
pageant
would
do
as
well
without
the
man
the
man
would
do
as
well
without
the
pageant
kings
have
been
declared
to
be
of
low
company
and
this
maxim
besides
the
reason
sometimes
assigned
for
it
viz
that
they
meet
with
less
opposition
to
their
wills
from
such
persons
will
i
suspect
be
found
to
turn
at
last
on
the
consideration
i
am
here
stating
that
they
also
meet
with
more
sympathy
in
their
tastes
the
most
ignorant
and
thoughtless
have
the
greatest
admiration
of
the
baubles
the
outward
symbols
of
pomp
and
power
the
sound
and
show
which
are
the
habitual
delight
and
mighty
prerogative
of
kings
the
stupidest
slave
worships
the
gaudiest
tyrant
the
same
gross
motives
appeal
to
the
same
gross
capacities
flatter
the
pride
of
the
superior
and
excite
the
servility
of
the
dependant
whereas
a
higher
reach
of
moral
and
intellectual
refinement
might
seek
in
vain
for
higher
proofs
of
internal
worth
and
inherent
majesty
in
the
object
of
its
idolatry
and
not
finding
the
divinity
lodged
within
the
unreasonable
expectation
raised
would
probably
end
in
mortification
on
both
sides
there
is
little
to
distinguish
a
king
from
his
subjects
but
the
rabble
shout
if
he
loses
that
and
is
reduced
to
the
forlorn
hope
of
gaining
the
suffrages
of
the
wise
and
good
he
is
of
all
men
the
most
but
enough
of
this
like
it
says
miss
branghton
in
meaning
the
opera
it
is
not
vulgar
that
is
she
likes
it
not
because
there
is
anything
to
like
in
it
but
because
other
people
are
prevented
from
liking
or
knowing
anything
about
it
janus
weathercock
laugheth
to
scorn
and
spitefully
entreateth
and
hugely
condemneth
my
dramatic
criticisms
in
the
for
a
like
exquisite
reason
i
must
therefore
make
an
example
of
him
to
all
such
hypercritics
he
finds
fault
with
me
and
calls
my
taste
vulgar
because
i
go
to
sadler
wells
place
he
has
heard
of
o
lord
sir
because
i
notice
the
miss
dennetts
favourites
with
the
whitechapel
orders
praise
miss
valancy
bouncing
columbine
at
ashley
and
them
there
places
as
his
barber
informs
him
has
he
no
way
of
establishing
himself
in
his
own
good
opinion
but
by
triumphing
over
his
barber
bad
english
and
finally
because
i
recognised
the
existence
of
the
coburg
and
the
surrey
theatres
at
the
names
of
which
he
cries
with
great
significance
as
if
he
had
some
personal
disgust
at
them
and
yet
he
would
be
supposed
never
to
have
entered
them
it
is
not
his
cue
as
a
critic
beau
now
this
appears
to
me
a
very
crude
unmeaning
indiscriminate
wholesale
and
vulgar
way
of
thinking
it
is
prejudicing
things
in
the
lump
by
names
and
places
and
classes
instead
of
judging
of
them
by
what
they
are
in
themselves
by
their
real
qualities
and
shades
of
distinction
there
is
no
selection
truth
or
delicacy
in
such
a
mode
of
proceeding
it
is
affecting
ignorance
and
making
it
a
title
to
wisdom
it
is
a
vapid
assumption
of
superiority
it
is
exceeding
impertinence
it
is
rank
coxcombry
it
is
nothing
in
the
world
else
to
condemn
because
the
multitude
admire
is
as
essentially
vulgar
as
to
admire
because
they
admire
there
is
no
exercise
of
taste
or
judgment
in
either
case
both
are
equally
repugnant
to
good
sense
and
of
the
two
i
should
prefer
the
side
i
would
as
soon
agree
with
my
barber
as
differ
from
him
and
why
should
i
make
a
point
of
reversing
the
sentence
of
the
whitechapel
orders
or
how
can
it
affect
my
opinion
of
the
merits
of
an
actor
at
the
coburg
or
the
surrey
theatres
that
these
theatres
are
in
or
out
of
the
bills
of
mortality
this
is
an
easy
way
of
judging
as
gross
as
it
is
mechanical
it
is
not
a
difficult
matter
to
settle
questions
of
taste
by
consulting
the
map
of
london
or
to
prove
your
liberality
by
geographical
distinctions
janus
jumbles
things
together
strangely
if
he
had
seen
kean
in
a
provincial
theatre
at
exeter
or
taunton
he
would
have
thought
it
vulgar
to
admire
him
but
when
he
had
been
stamped
in
london
janus
would
no
doubt
show
his
discernment
and
the
subtlety
of
his
tact
for
the
display
of
character
and
passion
by
not
being
behind
the
fashion
the
miss
dennetts
are
unformed
girls
for
no
other
reason
than
because
they
danced
at
one
of
the
minor
theatres
let
them
but
come
out
on
the
opera
boards
and
let
the
beauty
and
fashion
of
the
season
greet
them
with
a
fairy
shower
of
delighted
applause
and
they
would
outshine
milanie
the
foot
of
fire
his
gorge
rises
at
the
mention
of
a
certain
quarter
of
the
town
whatever
passes
current
in
another
he
total
grist
unsifted
husks
and
all
this
is
not
taste
but
folly
at
this
rate
the
who
drives
him
or
his
horse
contributor
whom
he
has
introduced
as
a
select
personage
to
the
vulgar
reader
knows
as
much
of
the
matter
as
he
in
a
word
the
answer
to
all
this
in
the
first
instance
is
to
say
what
vulgarity
is
now
its
essence
i
imagine
consists
in
taking
manners
actions
words
opinions
on
trust
from
others
without
examining
one
own
feelings
or
weighing
the
merits
of
the
case
it
is
coarseness
or
shallowness
of
taste
arising
from
want
of
individual
refinement
together
with
the
confidence
and
presumption
inspired
by
example
and
numbers
it
may
be
defined
to
be
a
prostitution
of
the
mind
or
body
to
ape
the
more
or
less
obvious
defects
of
others
because
by
so
doing
we
shall
secure
the
suffrages
of
those
we
associate
with
to
affect
a
gesture
an
opinion
a
phrase
because
it
is
the
rage
with
a
large
number
of
persons
or
to
hold
it
in
abhorrence
because
another
set
of
persons
very
little
if
at
all
better
informed
cry
it
down
to
distinguish
themselves
from
the
former
is
in
either
case
equal
vulgarity
and
absurdity
a
thing
is
not
vulgar
merely
because
it
is
common
is
common
to
breathe
to
see
to
feel
to
live
nothing
is
vulgar
that
is
natural
spontaneous
unavoidable
grossness
is
not
vulgarity
ignorance
is
not
vulgarity
awkwardness
is
not
vulgarity
but
all
these
become
vulgar
when
they
are
affected
and
shown
off
on
the
authority
of
others
or
to
fall
in
with
or
the
company
we
keep
caliban
is
coarse
enough
but
surely
he
is
not
vulgar
we
might
as
well
spurn
the
clod
under
our
feet
and
call
it
vulgar
cobbett
is
coarse
enough
but
he
is
not
vulgar
he
does
not
belong
to
the
herd
nothing
real
nothing
original
can
be
vulgar
but
i
should
think
an
imitator
of
cobbett
a
vulgar
man
emery
yorkshireman
is
vulgar
because
he
is
a
yorkshireman
it
is
the
cant
and
gibberish
the
cunning
and
low
life
of
a
particular
district
it
has
stamp
exclusive
and
provincial
he
might
most
brutishly
and
yet
not
fall
under
the
letter
of
the
definition
but
speech
bewrayeth
him
his
dialect
like
the
jargon
of
a
bond
street
lounger
is
the
damning
circumstance
if
he
were
a
mere
blockhead
it
would
not
signify
but
he
thinks
himself
a
hand
according
to
the
notions
and
practices
of
those
with
whom
he
was
brought
up
and
which
he
thinks
everywhere
in
a
word
this
character
is
not
the
offspring
of
untutored
nature
but
of
bad
habits
it
is
made
up
of
ignorance
and
conceit
it
has
a
mixture
of
in
it
all
slang
phrases
are
for
the
same
reason
vulgar
but
there
is
nothing
vulgar
in
the
common
english
idiom
simplicity
is
not
vulgarity
but
the
looking
to
affectation
of
any
sort
for
distinction
is
a
cockney
is
a
vulgar
character
whose
imagination
can
not
wander
beyond
the
suburbs
of
the
metropolis
so
is
a
fellow
who
is
always
thinking
of
the
high
street
edinburgh
we
want
a
name
for
this
last
character
an
opinion
is
vulgar
that
is
stewed
in
the
rank
breath
of
the
rabble
nor
is
it
a
bit
purer
or
more
refined
for
having
passed
through
the
teeth
of
a
whole
court
the
inherent
vulgarity
is
in
having
no
other
feeling
on
any
subject
than
the
crude
blind
headling
gregarious
notion
acquired
by
sympathy
with
the
mixed
multitude
or
with
a
fastidious
minority
who
are
just
as
insensible
to
the
real
truth
and
as
indifferent
to
everything
but
their
own
frivolous
and
vexatious
pretensions
the
upper
are
not
wiser
than
the
lower
orders
because
they
resolve
to
differ
from
them
the
fashionable
have
the
advantage
of
the
unfashionable
in
nothing
but
the
fashion
the
true
vulgar
are
the
pecus
the
herd
of
pretenders
to
what
they
do
not
feel
and
to
what
is
not
natural
to
them
whether
in
high
or
low
life
to
belong
to
any
class
to
move
in
any
rank
or
sphere
of
life
is
not
a
very
exclusive
distinction
or
test
of
refinement
refinement
will
in
all
classes
be
the
exception
not
the
rule
and
the
exception
may
fall
out
in
one
class
as
well
as
another
a
king
is
but
an
hereditary
title
a
nobleman
is
only
one
of
the
house
of
peers
to
be
a
knight
or
alderman
is
confessedly
a
vulgar
thing
the
king
the
other
day
made
sir
walter
scott
a
baronet
but
not
all
the
power
of
the
three
estates
could
make
another
author
of
princes
heroes
are
often
commonplace
people
hamlet
was
not
a
vulgar
character
neither
was
don
quixote
to
be
an
author
to
be
a
painter
is
nothing
it
is
a
trick
it
is
a
trade
an
author
is
a
venerable
name
how
few
deserve
it
yet
what
numbers
claim
nay
to
be
a
member
of
the
royal
academy
or
a
fellow
of
the
royal
society
is
but
a
vulgar
distinction
but
to
be
a
virgil
a
milton
a
raphael
a
claude
is
what
fell
to
the
lot
of
humanity
but
once
i
do
not
think
they
were
vulgar
people
though
for
anything
i
know
to
the
contrary
the
first
lord
of
the
bedchamber
may
be
a
very
vulgar
man
for
anything
i
know
to
the
contrary
he
may
not
be
such
are
pretty
much
my
notions
of
gentility
and
vulgarity
there
is
a
and
an
mob
both
which
i
hate
profanum
vulgus
et
the
vapid
affectation
of
the
one
to
me
is
even
more
intolerable
than
the
gross
insolence
and
brutality
of
the
other
if
a
set
of
fellows
are
noisy
rude
and
boisterous
to
show
their
disregard
of
the
company
a
set
of
fashionable
coxcombs
are
to
a
nauseous
degree
finical
and
effeminate
to
show
their
thorough
breeding
the
one
are
governed
by
their
feelings
however
coarse
and
misguided
which
is
something
the
others
consult
only
appearances
which
are
nothing
either
as
a
test
of
happiness
or
virtue
hogarth
in
his
prints
has
trimmed
the
balance
of
pretension
between
the
downright
blackguard
and
the
fine
gentleman
unanswerably
it
does
not
appear
in
his
moral
demonstrations
whatever
it
may
do
in
the
genteel
of
lord
chesterfield
or
the
chivalrous
rhapsodies
of
burke
that
vice
by
losing
all
its
grossness
loses
half
its
evil
it
becomes
more
contemptible
not
less
disgusting
what
is
there
in
common
for
instance
between
his
beaux
and
belles
his
rakes
and
his
coquettes
and
the
men
and
women
the
true
heroic
and
ideal
characters
in
raphael
but
his
people
of
fashion
and
quality
are
just
upon
a
par
with
the
low
the
selfish
the
characters
in
the
contrasted
view
of
human
life
and
are
often
the
very
same
characters
only
changing
places
if
the
lower
ranks
are
actuated
by
envy
and
uncharitableness
towards
the
upper
the
latter
have
scarcely
any
feelings
but
of
pride
contempt
and
aversion
to
the
lower
if
the
poor
would
pull
down
the
rich
to
get
at
their
good
things
the
rich
would
tread
down
the
poor
as
in
a
and
squeeze
the
last
shilling
out
of
their
pockets
and
the
last
drop
of
blood
out
of
their
veins
if
the
headstrong
and
unruly
turbulence
of
a
common
alehouse
are
shocking
what
shall
we
say
to
the
studied
insincerity
the
insipid
want
of
common
sense
the
callous
insensibility
of
the
and
boudoir
i
would
rather
see
the
feelings
of
our
common
nature
for
they
are
the
same
at
bottom
expressed
in
the
most
naked
and
unqualified
way
than
see
every
feeling
of
our
nature
suppressed
stifled
hermetically
sealed
under
the
smooth
cold
glittering
varnish
of
pretended
refinement
and
conventional
politeness
the
one
may
be
corrected
by
being
better
informed
the
other
is
incorrigible
wilful
heartless
depravity
i
can
not
describe
the
contempt
and
disgust
i
have
felt
at
the
tone
of
what
would
be
thought
good
company
when
i
have
witnessed
the
sleek
smiling
glossy
gratuitous
assumption
of
superiority
to
every
feeling
of
humanity
honesty
or
principle
as
a
part
of
the
etiquette
the
mental
and
moral
of
the
table
and
every
profession
of
toleration
or
favour
for
the
lower
orders
that
is
for
the
great
mass
of
our
treated
as
an
indecorum
and
breach
of
the
harmony
of
society
in
short
i
prefer
a
to
the
adder
den
or
to
put
this
case
in
its
extremest
point
of
view
i
have
more
patience
with
men
in
a
rude
state
of
nature
outraging
the
human
form
than
i
have
with
apes
mops
and
mows
at
the
extravagances
they
have
first
provoked
i
can
endure
the
brutality
as
it
is
termed
of
mobs
better
than
the
inhumanity
of
courts
the
violence
of
the
one
rages
like
a
fire
the
insidious
policy
of
the
other
strikes
like
a
pestilence
and
is
more
fatal
and
inevitable
the
slow
poison
of
despotism
is
worse
than
the
convulsive
struggles
of
anarchy
all
evils
says
hume
is
the
shortest
lived
the
one
may
out
like
a
wild
overthrow
but
the
other
from
its
secret
sacred
stand
operates
unseen
and
undermines
the
happiness
of
kingdoms
for
ages
lurks
in
the
hollow
cheek
and
stares
you
in
the
face
in
the
ghastly
eye
of
want
and
agony
and
woe
it
is
dreadful
to
hear
the
noise
and
uproar
of
an
infuriated
multitude
stung
by
the
sense
of
wrong
and
maddened
by
sympathy
it
is
more
appalling
to
think
of
the
smile
answered
by
other
gracious
smiles
of
the
whisper
echoed
by
other
assenting
whispers
which
doom
them
first
to
despair
and
then
to
destruction
popular
fury
finds
its
counterpart
in
courtly
servility
if
every
outrage
is
to
be
apprehended
from
the
one
every
iniquity
is
deliberately
sanctioned
by
the
other
without
regard
to
justice
or
decency
the
word
of
a
king
thou
and
do
likewise
makes
the
stoutest
heart
dumb
truth
and
honesty
shrink
before
it
if
there
are
watchwords
for
the
rabble
have
not
the
polite
and
fashionable
their
hackneyed
phrases
their
fulsome
unmeaning
jargon
as
well
both
are
to
me
anathema
to
return
to
the
first
question
as
it
regards
individual
and
private
manners
there
is
a
fine
illustration
of
the
effects
of
preposterous
and
affected
gentility
in
the
character
of
gertrude
in
the
old
comedy
of
hoe
written
by
ben
jonson
marston
and
chapman
in
conjunction
this
play
is
supposed
to
have
given
rise
to
series
of
prints
of
the
idle
and
industrious
apprentice
and
there
is
something
exceedingly
hogarthian
in
the
view
both
of
vulgar
and
of
genteel
life
here
displayed
the
character
of
gertrude
in
particular
the
heroine
of
the
piece
is
inimitably
drawn
the
mixture
of
vanity
and
meanness
the
internal
worthlessness
and
external
pretence
the
rustic
ignorance
and
fine
airs
the
intoxication
of
novelty
and
infatuation
of
pride
appear
like
a
dream
or
romance
rather
than
anything
in
real
life
cinderella
and
her
glass
slipper
are
to
it
she
is
not
like
millamant
a
century
afterwards
the
accomplished
fine
lady
but
a
pretender
to
all
the
foppery
and
finery
of
the
character
it
is
the
honeymoon
with
her
ladyship
and
her
folly
is
at
the
full
to
be
a
wife
and
the
wife
of
a
knight
are
to
her
pleasures
in
their
newest
gloss
and
nothing
can
exceed
her
raptures
in
the
contemplation
of
both
parts
of
the
dilemma
it
is
not
familiarity
but
novelty
that
weds
her
to
the
court
she
rises
into
the
air
of
gentility
from
the
ground
of
a
city
life
and
flutters
about
there
with
all
the
fantastic
delight
of
a
butterfly
that
has
just
changed
its
caterpillar
state
the
sound
of
my
lady
intoxicates
her
with
delight
makes
her
giddy
and
almost
turns
her
brain
on
the
bare
strength
of
it
she
is
ready
to
turn
her
father
and
mother
out
of
doors
and
treats
her
brother
and
sister
with
infinite
disdain
and
judicial
hardness
of
heart
with
some
speculators
the
modern
philosophy
has
deadened
and
distorted
all
the
natural
affections
and
before
abstract
ideas
and
the
mischievous
refinements
of
literature
were
introduced
nothing
was
to
be
met
with
in
the
primeval
state
of
society
but
simplicity
and
pastoral
innocence
of
manners
and
all
was
conscience
and
tender
heart
this
historical
play
gives
the
lie
to
the
above
theory
pretty
broadly
yet
delicately
our
heroine
is
as
vain
as
she
is
ignorant
and
as
unprincipled
as
she
is
both
and
without
an
idea
or
wish
of
any
kind
but
that
of
adorning
her
person
in
the
glass
and
being
called
and
thought
a
lady
something
superior
to
a
citizen
wife
she
is
so
bent
on
finery
that
she
believes
in
miracles
to
obtain
it
and
expects
the
fairies
to
bring
it
her
she
is
quite
above
thinking
of
a
settlement
jointure
or
she
takes
the
will
for
the
deed
all
through
the
piece
and
is
so
besotted
with
this
ignorant
vulgar
notion
of
rank
and
title
as
a
real
thing
that
can
not
be
counterfeited
that
she
is
the
dupe
of
her
own
fine
stratagems
and
marries
a
gull
a
dolt
a
broken
adventurer
for
an
accomplished
and
brave
gentleman
her
meanness
is
equal
to
her
folly
and
her
pride
and
nothing
can
be
greater
yet
she
holds
out
on
the
strength
of
her
original
pretensions
for
a
long
time
and
plays
the
upstart
with
decency
and
imposing
consistency
indeed
her
infatuation
and
caprices
are
akin
to
the
flighty
perversity
of
a
disordered
imagination
and
another
turn
of
the
wheel
of
good
or
evil
fortune
would
have
sent
her
to
keep
company
with
in
bedlam
or
with
decker
group
of
coquettes
in
the
same
the
other
parts
of
the
play
are
a
dreary
like
cuckold
point
on
the
coast
of
essex
where
the
preconcerted
shipwreck
takes
place
that
winds
up
the
catastrophe
of
the
piece
but
this
is
also
characteristic
of
the
age
and
serves
as
a
contrast
to
the
airy
and
factitious
character
which
is
the
principal
figure
in
the
plot
we
had
made
but
little
progress
from
that
point
till
hogarth
time
if
hogarth
is
to
be
believed
in
his
description
of
city
manners
how
wonderfully
we
have
distanced
it
since
without
going
into
this
at
length
there
is
one
circumstance
would
mention
in
which
i
think
there
has
been
a
striking
improvement
in
the
family
economy
of
modern
times
and
that
is
in
the
relation
of
mistresses
and
servants
after
visits
and
finery
a
married
woman
of
the
old
school
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
attend
to
her
housewifery
she
had
no

it
over
her

modern
supplies
the
place
of

persecution
and

a
woman
now
seldom
goes
into
the
kitchen
to
look
after
the
servants
formerly
what
was
called
a
good
manager
an
exemplary
mistress
of
a
family
did
nothing
but
hunt
them
from
morning
to
night
from
one
year
end
to
another
without
leaving
them
a
moment
rest
peace
or
comfort
now
a
servant
is
left
to
do
her
work
without
this
suspicious
and
tormenting
interference
and
at
every
step
and
she
does
it
all
the
better
the
proverbs
about
the
mistress
eye
are
no
longer
held
for
current
a
woman
from
this
habit
which
at
last
became
an
uncontrollable
passion
would
scold
her
maids
for
fifty
years
together
and
nothing
could
stop
her
now
the
temptation
to
read
the
last
new
poem
or
novel

the
necessity
of
talking
of
it
in
the

she
goes

the
benefit
to
all
parties
is
incalculable

that

and
by
your

i
speak
it
not
without

as

take
me
to
thy
mercy
out
of
this
miserable
city
presently
carry
me
out
of
the
scent
of
newcastle
coal
and
the
hearing
of
i
beseech
thee
down
with
me
for
god
sake
i
scene
i
this
dotage
on
sound
and
show
seemed
characteristic
of
that
age
see
way
to
pay
old
debts

as
if
in
the
grossness
of
sense
and
the
absence
of
all
intellectual
and
abstract
topics
of
thought
and
discourse
the
thin
circulating
medium
of
the
present
day
the
mind
was
attracted
without
the
power
of
resistance
to
the
tinkling
sound
of
its
own
name
with
a
title
added
to
it
and
the
image
of
its
own
person
tricked
out
in
finery
the
effect
no
doubt
was
also
more
marked
and
striking
from
the
contrast
between
the
ordinary
penury
and
poverty
of
the
age
and
the
first
and
more
extravagant
demonstrations
of
luxury
and
artificial
refinement
good

essay
i
on
a
landscape
of
nicolas
poussin
and
blind
orion
hungry
for
the
morn
orion
the
subject
of
this
landscape
was
the
classical
nimrod
and
is
called
by
homer
hunter
of
shadows
himself
a
shade
he
was
the
son
of
neptune
and
having
lost
an
eye
in
some
affray
between
the
gods
and
men
was
told
that
if
he
would
go
to
meet
the
rising
sun
he
would
recover
his
sight
he
is
represented
setting
out
on
his
journey
with
men
on
his
shoulders
to
guide
him
a
bow
in
his
hand
and
diana
in
the
clouds
greeting
him
he
stalks
along
a
giant
upon
earth
and
reels
and
falters
in
his
gait
as
if
just
awakened
out
of
sleep
or
uncertain
of
his
way
you
see
his
blindness
though
his
back
is
turned
mists
rise
around
him
and
veil
the
sides
of
the
green
forests
earth
is
dank
and
fresh
with
dews
the
dawn
and
the
pleiades
before
him
dance
and
in
the
distance
are
seen
the
blue
hills
and
sullen
ocean
nothing
was
ever
more
finely
conceived
or
done
it
breathes
the
spirit
of
the
morning
its
moisture
its
repose
its
obscurity
waiting
the
miracle
of
light
to
kindle
it
into
smiles
the
whole
is
like
the
principal
figure
in
it
forerunner
of
the
dawn
the
same
atmosphere
tinges
and
imbues
every
object
the
same
dull
light
sets
off
the
face
of
nature
one
feeling
of
vastness
of
strangeness
and
of
primeval
forms
pervades
the
painter
canvas
and
we
are
thrown
back
upon
the
first
integrity
of
things
this
great
and
learned
man
might
be
said
to
see
nature
through
the
glass
of
time
he
alone
has
a
right
to
be
considered
as
the
painter
of
classical
antiquity
sir
joshua
has
done
him
justice
in
this
respect
he
could
give
to
the
scenery
of
his
heroic
fables
that
unimpaired
look
of
original
nature
full
solid
large
luxuriant
teeming
with
life
and
power
or
deck
it
with
all
the
pomp
of
art
with
tempyles
and
towers
and
mythologic
groves
his
pictures
a
foregone
conclusion
he
applies
nature
to
his
purposes
works
out
her
images
according
to
the
standard
of
his
thoughts
embodies
high
fictions
and
the
first
conception
being
given
all
the
rest
seems
to
grow
out
of
and
be
assimilated
to
it
by
the
unfailing
process
of
a
studious
imagination
like
his
own
orion
he
overlooks
the
surrounding
scene
appears
to
up
the
isles
as
a
very
little
thing
and
to
lay
the
earth
in
a
balance
with
a
laborious
and
mighty
grasp
he
puts
nature
into
the
mould
of
the
ideal
and
antique
and
was
among
painters
more
than
any
one
else
what
milton
was
among
poets
there
is
in
both
something
of
the
same
pedantry
the
same
stiffness
the
same
elevation
the
same
grandeur
the
same
mixture
of
art
and
nature
the
same
richness
of
borrowed
materials
the
same
unity
of
character
neither
the
poet
nor
the
painter
lowered
the
subjects
they
treated
but
filled
up
the
outline
in
the
fancy
and
added
strength
and
reality
to
it
and
thus
not
only
satisfied
but
surpassed
the
expectations
of
the
spectator
and
the
reader
this
is
held
for
the
triumph
and
the
perfection
of
works
of
art
to
give
us
nature
such
as
we
see
it
is
well
and
deserving
of
praise
to
give
us
nature
such
as
we
have
never
seen
but
have
often
wished
to
see
it
is
better
and
deserving
of
higher
praise
he
who
can
show
the
world
in
its
first
naked
glory
with
the
hues
of
fancy
spread
over
it
or
in
its
high
and
palmy
state
with
the
gravity
of
history
stamped
on
the
proud
monuments
of
vanished
empire
who
by
his
potent
art
can
recall
time
past
transport
us
to
distant
places
and
join
the
regions
of
imagination
a
new
conquest
to
those
of
reality
who
shows
us
not
only
what
nature
is
but
what
she
has
been
and
is
capable
of
he
who
does
this
and
does
it
with
simplicity
with
truth
and
grandeur
is
lord
of
nature
and
her
powers
and
his
mind
is
universal
and
his
art
the
there
is
nothing
in
this
than
natural
if
criticism
could
be
persuaded
to
think
so
the
historic
painter
does
not
neglect
or
contravene
nature
but
follows
her
more
closely
up
into
her
fantastic
heights
or
hidden
recesses
he
demonstrates
what
she
would
be
in
conceivable
circumstances
and
under
implied
conditions
he
to
airy
nothing
a
local
habitation
not
name
at
his
touch
words
start
up
into
images
thoughts
become
things
he
clothes
a
dream
a
phantom
with
form
and
colour
and
the
wholesome
attributes
of
reality
art
is
a
second
nature
not
a
different
one
there
are
those
indeed
who
think
that
not
to
copy
nature
is
the
rule
for
attaining
perfection
because
they
can
not
paint
the
objects
which
they
have
they
have
they
fancy
themselves
qualified
to
paint
the
ideas
which
they
have
not
seen
but
it
is
possible
to
fail
in
this
latter
and
more
difficult
style
of
imitation
as
well
as
in
the
former
humbler
one
the
detection
it
is
true
is
not
so
easy
because
the
objects
are
not
so
nigh
at
hand
to
compare
and
therefore
there
is
more
room
both
for
false
pretension
and
for
they
take
an
epic
motto
or
subject
and
conclude
that
the
spirit
is
implied
as
a
thing
of
course
they
paint
inferior
portraits
maudlin
lifeless
faces
without
ordinary
expression
or
one
look
feature
or
particle
of
nature
in
them
and
think
that
this
is
to
rise
to
the
truth
of
history
they
vulgarise
and
degrade
whatever
is
interesting
or
sacred
to
the
mind
and
suppose
that
they
thus
add
to
the
dignity
of
their
profession
they
represent
a
face
that
seems
as
if
no
thought
or
feeling
of
any
kind
had
ever
passed
through
it
and
would
have
you
believe
that
this
is
the
very
sublime
of
expression
such
as
it
would
appear
in
heroes
or
demigods
of
old
when
rapture
or
agony
was
raised
to
its
height
they
show
you
a
landscape
that
looks
as
if
the
sun
never
shone
upon
it
and
tell
you
that
it
is
not
modern
that
so
earth
looked
when
titan
first
kissed
it
with
his
rays
this
is
not
the
true
ideal
it
is
not
to
fill
the
moulds
of
the
imagination
but
to
deface
and
injure
them
it
is
not
to
come
up
to
but
to
fall
short
of
the
poorest
conception
in
the
public
mind
such
pictures
should
not
be
hung
in
the
same
room
with
that
of
orion
poussin
was
of
all
painters
the
most
poetical
he
was
the
painter
of
ideas
no
one
ever
told
a
story
half
so
well
nor
so
well
knew
what
was
capable
of
being
told
by
the
pencil
he
seized
on
and
struck
off
with
grace
and
precision
just
that
point
of
view
which
would
be
likely
to
catch
the
reader
fancy
there
is
a
significance
a
consciousness
in
whatever
he
does
sometimes
a
vice
but
oftener
a
virtue
beyond
any
other
painter
his
giants
sitting
on
the
tops
of
craggy
mountains
as
huge
themselves
and
playing
idly
on
their
seem
to
have
been
seated
there
these
three
thousand
years
and
to
know
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
their
own
story
an
infant
bacchus
or
jupiter
is
big
with
his
future
destiny
even
inanimate
and
dumb
things
speak
a
language
of
their
own
his
snakes
the
messengers
of
fate
are
inspired
with
human
intellect
his
trees
grow
and
expand
their
leaves
in
the
air
glad
of
the
rain
proud
of
the
sun
awake
to
the
winds
of
heaven
in
his
plague
of
athens
the
very
buildings
seem
stiff
with
horror
his
picture
of
the
deluge
is
perhaps
the
finest
historical
landscape
in
the
world
you
see
a
waste
of
waters
wide
interminable
the
sun
is
labouring
wan
and
weary
up
the
sky
the
clouds
dull
and
leaden
lie
like
a
load
upon
the
eye
and
heaven
and
earth
seem
commingling
into
one
confused
mass
his
human
figures
are
sometimes
with
this
kind
of
feeling
their
actions
have
too
much
gesticulation
and
the
set
expression
of
the
features
borders
too
much
on
the
mechanical
and
caricatured
style
in
this
respect
they
form
a
contrast
to
raphael
whose
figures
never
appear
to
be
sitting
for
their
pictures
or
to
be
conscious
of
a
spectator
or
to
have
come
from
the
painter
hand
in
nicolas
poussin
on
the
contrary
everything
seems
to
have
a
distinct
understanding
with
the
artist
very
stones
prate
of
their
whereabout
each
object
has
its
part
and
place
assigned
and
is
in
a
sort
of
compact
with
the
rest
of
the
picture
it
is
this
conscious
keeping
and
as
it
were
design
that
gives
their
peculiar
character
to
the
works
of
this
artist
there
was
a
picture
of
aurora
in
the
british
gallery
a
year
or
two
ago
it
was
a
suffusion
of
golden
light
the
goddess
wore
her
robes
and
appeared
just
risen
from
the
gloomy
bed
of
old
tithonus
her
very
steeds
were
tinged
with
the
yellow
dawn
it
was
a
personification
of
the
morning
poussin
succeeded
better
in
classic
than
in
sacred
subjects
the
latter
are
comparatively
heavy
forced
full
of
violent
contrasts
of
colour
of
red
blue
and
black
and
without
the
true
prophetic
inspiration
of
the
characters
but
in
his
pagan
allegories
and
fables
he
was
quite
at
home
the
native
gravity
and
native
levity
of
the
frenchman
were
combined
with
italian
scenery
and
an
antique
gusto
and
gave
even
to
his
colouring
an
air
of
learned
indifference
he
wants
in
one
respect
grace
form
expression
but
he
has
everywhere
sense
and
meaning
perfect
costume
and
propriety
his
personages
always
belong
to
the
class
and
time
represented
and
are
strictly
versed
in
the
business
in
hand
his
grotesque
compositions
in
particular
his
nymphs
and
fauns
are
superior
at
least
as
far
as
style
is
concerned
even
to
those
of
rubens
they
are
taken
more
immediately
out
of
fabulous
history
rubens
satyrs
and
bacchantes
have
a
more
jovial
and
voluptuous
aspect
are
more
drunk
with
pleasure
more
full
of
animal
spirits
and
riotous
impulses
they
laugh
and
bound
along
leaping
like
wanton
kids
in
pleasant
spring
but
those
of
poussin
have
more
of
the
intellectual
part
of
the
character
and
seem
vicious
on
reflection
and
of
set
purpose
are
noble
specimens
of
a
class
poussin
are
allegorical
abstractions
of
the
same
class
with
bodies
less
pampered
but
with
minds
more
secretly
depraved
the
bacchanalian
groups
of
the
flemish
painter
were
however
his
masterpieces
in
composition
witness
those
prodigies
of
colour
character
and
expression
at
blenheim
in
the
more
chaste
and
refined
delineation
of
classic
fable
poussin
was
without
a
rival
rubens
who
was
a
match
for
him
in
the
wild
and
picturesque
could
not
pretend
to
vie
with
the
elegance
and
purity
of
thought
in
his
picture
of
apollo
giving
a
poet
a
cup
of
water
to
drink
nor
with
the
gracefulness
of
design
in
the
figure
of
a
nymph
squeezing
the
juice
of
a
bunch
of
grapes
from
her
fingers
a
rosy
which
falls
into
the
mouth
of
a
chubby
infant
below
but
above
all
who
shall
celebrate
in
terms
of
fit
praise
his
picture
of
the
shepherds
in
the
vale
of
tempe
going
out
in
a
fine
morning
of
the
spring
and
coming
to
a
tomb
with
this
inscription
et
ego
in
arcadia
vixi
the
eager
curiosity
of
some
the
expression
of
others
who
start
back
with
fear
and
surprise
the
clear
breeze
playing
with
the
branches
of
the
shadowing
trees
valleys
low
where
the
mild
zephyrs
use
the
distant
uninterrupted
sunny
prospect
speak
and
for
ever
will
speak
on
of
ages
past
to
ages
yet
to
come
pictures
are
a
set
of
chosen
images
a
stream
of
pleasant
thoughts
passing
through
the
mind
it
is
a
luxury
to
have
the
walls
of
our
rooms
hung
round
with
them
and
no
less
so
to
have
such
a
gallery
in
the
mind
to
con
over
the
relies
of
ancient
art
bound
up
the
book
and
volume
of
the
brain
unmixed
if
it
were
possible
with
baser
matter
a
life
passed
among
pictures
in
the
study
and
the
love
of
art
is
a
happy
noiseless
dream
or
rather
it
is
to
dream
and
to
be
awake
at
the
same
time
for
it
has
all
sober
certainty
of
waking
bliss
with
the
romantic
voluptuousness
of
a
visionary
and
abstracted
being
they
are
the
bright
consummate
essences
of
things
and
who
knows
of
these
delights
to
taste
and
interpose
them
oft
is
not
unwise
the
orion
which
i
have
here
taken
occasion
to
descant
upon
is
one
of
a
collection
of
excellent
pictures
as
this
collection
is
itself
one
of
a
series
from
the
old
masters
which
have
for
some
years
back
embrowned
the
walls
of
the
british
gallery
and
enriched
the
public
eye
what
hues
those
of
nature
mellowed
by
time
breathe
around
as
we
enter
what
forms
are
there
woven
into
the
memory
what
looks
which
only
the
answering
looks
of
the
spectator
can
express
what
intellectual
stores
have
been
yearly
poured
forth
from
the
shrine
of
ancient
art
the
works
are
various
but
the
names
the
same
heaps
of
rembrandts
frowning
from
the
darkened
walls
rubens
glad
gorgeous
groups
titians
more
rich
and
rare
claudes
always
exquisite
sometimes
beyond
compare
guido
endless
cloying
sweetness
the
learning
of
poussin
and
the
caracci
and
princely
magnificence
crowning
all
we
read
certain
letters
and
syllables
in
the
catalogue
and
at
the
magic
sound
a
miracle
of
skill
and
beauty
starts
to
view
one
might
think
that
one
prodigal
display
of
such
perfection
would
exhaust
the
labours
of
one
man
life
but
the
next
year
and
the
next
to
that
we
find
another
harvest
reaped
and
gathered
in
to
the
great
garner
of
art
by
the
same
immortal
hands
old
genius
the
porter
of
them
was

he
letteth
out
to
their
works
seem
endless
as
their
reputation
to
be
many
as
they
are
complete
to
multiply
with
the
desire
of
the
mind
to
see
more
and
more
of
them
as
if
there
were
a
living
power
in
the
breath
of
fame
and
in
the
very
names
of
the
great
heirs
of
glory
were
propagation
to

to
have
one
last
lingering
look
yet
to
come
pictures
are
scattered
like
stray
gifts
through
the
world
and
while
they
remain
earth
has
yet
a
little
gilding
left
not
quite
rubbed
off
dishonoured
and
defaced
there
are
plenty
of
standard
works
still
to
be
found
in
this
country
in
the
collections
at
blenheim
at
burleigh
and
in
those
belonging
to
angerstein
lord
grosvenor
the
marquis
of
stafford
and
others
to
keep
up
this
treat
to
the
lovers
of
art
for
many
years
and
it
is
the
more
desirable
to
reserve
a
privileged
sanctuary
of
this
sort
where
the
eye
may
dote
and
the
heart
take
its
fill
of
such
pictures
as
poussin
orion
since
the
louvre
is
stripped
of
its
triumphant
spoils
and
since
he
who
collected
it
and
wore
it
as
a
rich
jewel
in
his
iron
crown
the
hunter
of
greatness
and
of
glory
is
himself
a
shade
notes
to
essay
i
everything
tends
to
show
the
manner
in
which
a
great
artist
is
formed
if
any
person
could
claim
an
exemption
from
the
careful
imitation
of
individual
objects
it
was
nicolas
poussin
he
studied
the
antique
but
he
also
studied
nature
have
often
admired
says
vignuel
do
marville
who
knew
him
at
a
late
period
of
his
life
love
he
had
for
his
art
old
as
he
was
i
frequently
saw
him
among
the
ruins
of
ancient
rome
out
in
the
campagna
or
along
the
banks
of
the
tyber
sketching
a
scene
that
had
pleased
him
and
i
often
met
him
with
his
handkerchief
full
of
stones
moss
or
flowers
which
he
carried
home
that
he
might
copy
them
exactly
from
nature
one
day
i
asked
him
how
he
had
attained
to
such
a
degree
of
perfection
as
to
have
gained
so
high
a
rank
among
the
great
painters
of
italy
he
answered
i
have
neglected
nothing
his
life
lately
it
appears
from
this
account
that
he
had
not
fallen
into
a
recent
error
that
nature
puts
the
man
of
genius
out
as
a
contrast
to
the
foregoing
description
i
might
mention
that
i
remember
an
old
gentleman
once
asking
west
in
the
british
gallery
if
he
had
ever
been
at
athens
to
which
the
president
made
answer
no
nor
did
he
feel
any
great
desire
to
go
for
that
he
thought
he
had
as
good
an
idea
of
the
place
from
the
catalogue
as
he
could
get
by
living
there
for
any
number
of
years
what
would
he
have
said
if
any
one
had
told
him
he
could
get
as
good
an
idea
of
the
subject
of
one
of
his
great
works
from
reading
the
catalogue
of
it
as
from
seeing
the
picture
itself
yet
the
answer
was
characteristic
of
the
genius
of
the
painter
poussin
has
repeated
this
subject
more
than
once
and
appears
to
have
revelled
in
its
witcheries
i
have
before
alluded
to
it
and
may
again
it
is
hard
that
we
should
not
be
allowed
to
dwell
as
often
as
we
please
on
what
delights
us
when
things
that
are
disagreeable
recur
so
often
against
our
will
essay
ii
on
milton
sonnets
the
great
object
of
the
sonnet
seems
to
be
to
express
in
musical
numbers
and
as
it
were
with
undivided
breath
some
occasional
thought
or
personal
feeling
due
to
the
poet
breast
it
is
a
sigh
uttered
from
the
fulness
of
the
heart
an
involuntary
aspiration
born
and
dying
in
the
same
moment
i
have
always
been
fond
of
sonnets
for
this
reason
that
they
have
more
of
this
personal
and
internal
character
than
any
others
and
they
acquire
a
double
value
when
we
consider
that
they
come
from
the
pen
of
the
loftiest
of
our
poets
compared
with
lost
they
are
like
tender
flowers
that
adorn
the
base
of
some
proud
column
or
stately
temple
the
author
in
the
one
could
work
himself
up
with
unabated
fortitude
the
height
of
his
great
argument
but
in
the
other
he
has
shown
that
he
could
condescend
to
men
of
low
estate
and
after
the
lightning
and
the
thunderbolt
of
his
pen
lets
fall
some
drops
of
natural
pity
over
hapless
infirmity
mingling
strains
with
the
nightingale
musical
most
melancholy
the
immortal
poet
pours
his
mortal
sorrows
into
our
breasts
and
a
tear
falls
from
his
sightless
orbs
on
the
friendly
hand
he
presses
the
sonnets
are
a
kind
of
pensive
record
of
past
achievements
loves
and
friendships
and
a
noble
exhortation
to
himself
to
bear
up
with
cheerful
hope
and
confidence
to
the
last
some
of
them
are
of
a
more
quaint
and
humorous
character
but
i
speak
of
those
only
which
are
intended
to
be
serious
and
i
do
not
know
indeed
but
they
may
be
said
to
be
almost
the
first
effusions
of
this
sort
of
natural
and
personal
sentiment
in
the
language
drummond
ought
perhaps
to
be
excepted
were
they
formed
less
closely
on
the
model
of
petrarch
so
as
to
be
often
little
more
than
translations
of
the
italian
poet
but
milton
sonnets
are
truly
his
own
in
allusion
thought
and
versification
those
of
sir
philip
sydney
who
was
a
great
transgressor
in
his
way
turn
sufficiently
on
himself
and
his
own
adventures
but
they
are
elaborately
quaint
and
intricate
and
more
like
riddles
than
sonnets
they
are
tolerable
and
not
to
be
endured
shakespear
which
some
persons
better
informed
in
such
matters
than
i
can
pretend
to
be
profess
to
cry
up
as
divine
the
matchless
what
you
will
to
say
nothing
of
the
want
of
point
or
a
leading
prominent
idea
in
most
of
them
are
i
think
overcharged
and
monotonous
and
as
to
their
ultimate
drift
as
for
myself
i
can
make
neither
head
nor
tail
of
it
yet
some
of
them
i
own
are
sweet
even
to
a
sense
of
faintness
luscious
as
the
woodbine
and
graceful
and
luxuriant
like
it
here
is
one
from
you
have
i
been
absent
in
the
spring
when
april
dress
in
all
his
trim
hath
put
a
spirit
of
youth
in
every
thing
that
heavy
saturn
laugh
and
leap
with
him
yet
nor
the
lays
of
birds
nor
the
sweet
smell
of
different
flowers
in
odour
and
in
hue
could
make
me
any
summer
story
tell
or
from
their
proud
lap
pluck
them
where
they
grew
nor
did
i
wonder
at
the
lilies
white
nor
praise
the
deep
vermilion
in
the
rose
they
were
but
sweet
but
figures
of
delight
drawn
after
you
you
pattern
of
all
those
yet
seem
it
winter
still
and
you
away
as
with
your
shadow
i
with
these
did
play
i
am
not
aware
of
any
writer
of
sonnets
worth
mentioning
here
till
long
after
milton
that
is
till
the
time
of
warton
and
the
revival
of
a
taste
for
italian
and
for
our
own
early
literature
during
the
rage
for
french
models
the
sonnet
had
not
been
much
studied
it
is
a
mode
of
composition
that
depends
entirely
on
and
this
the
french
and
artificial
style
gladly
dispenses
with
as
it
lays
no
particular
stress
on
anything
except
vague
general
sonnets
are
undoubtedly
exquisite
both
in
style
and
matter
they
are
poetical
and
philosophical
effusions
of
very
delightful
sentiment
but
the
thoughts
though
fine
and
deeply
felt
are
not
like
subjects
identified
completely
with
the
writer
and
so
far
want
a
more
individual
interest
wordsworth
are
also
finely
conceived
and
sonnets
they
mouth
it
well
and
are
said
to
be
sacred
to
liberty
brutus
exclamation
virtue
i
thought
thee
a
substance
but
i
find
thee
a
shadow
was
not
considered
as
a
compliment
but
as
a
bitter
sarcasm
the
beauty
of
milton
sonnets
is
their
sincerity
the
spirit
of
poetical
patriotism
which
they
breathe
either
milton
or
the
living
bard
are
defective
in
this
respect
there
is
no
sonnet
of
milton
on
the
restoration
of
charles
ii
there
is
no
sonnet
of
wordsworth
corresponding
to
that
of
poet
blind
and
bold
the
late
massacre
in
piedmont
it
would
be
no
niggard
praise
to
wordsworth
to
grant
that
he
was
either
half
the
man
or
half
the
poet
that
milton
was
he
has
not
his
high
and
various
imagination
nor
his
deep
and
fixed
principle
milton
did
not
worship
the
rising
sun
nor
turn
his
back
on
a
losing
and
fallen
cause
such
recantation
had
no
charms
for
him
southey
has
thought
proper
to
put
the
author
of
into
his
late
heaven
on
the
understood
condition
that
he
is
longer
to
kings
and
to
hierarchs
hostile
in
his
lifetime
he
gave
no
sign
of
such
an
alteration
and
it
is
rather
presumptuous
in
the
to
pursue
the
deceased
antagonist
of
salmasius
into
the
other
world
to
compliment
him
with
his
own
infirmity
of
purpose
it
is
a
wonder
he
did
not
add
in
a
note
that
milton
called
him
aside
to
whisper
in
his
ear
that
he
preferred
the
new
english
hexameters
to
his
own
blank
verse
our
first
of
poets
was
one
of
our
first
of
men
he
was
an
eminent
instance
to
prove
that
a
poet
is
not
another
name
for
the
slave
of
power
and
fashion
as
is
the
case
with
painters
and
musicians
things
without
an
opinion
and
who
merely
aspire
to
make
up
the
pageant
and
show
of
the
day
there
are
persons
in
common
life
who
have
that
eager
curiosity
and
restless
admiration
of
bustle
and
splendour
that
sooner
than
not
be
admitted
on
great
occasions
of
feasting
and
luxurious
display
they
will
go
in
the
character
of
to
stand
behind
the
chairs
of
the
great
there
are
others
who
can
so
little
bear
to
be
left
for
any
length
of
time
out
of
the
grand
carnival
and
masquerade
of
pride
and
folly
that
they
will
gain
admittance
to
it
at
the
expense
of
their
characters
as
well
as
of
a
change
of
dress
milton
was
not
one
of
these
he
had
too
much
of
the
faculty
in
his
composition
a
lofty
contemplative
principle
and
consciousness
of
inward
power
and
worth
to
be
tempted
by
such
idle
baits
we
have
plenty
of
chanting
and
chiming
in
among
some
modern
writers
with
the
triumphs
over
their
own
views
and
principles
but
none
of
a
patient
resignation
to
defeat
sustaining
and
nourishing
itself
with
the
thought
of
the
justice
of
their
cause
and
with
rectitude
i
do
not
pretend
to
defend
the
tone
of
political
writings
which
was
borrowed
from
the
style
of
controversial
divinity
or
to
say
that
he
was
right
in
the
part
he
took
i
say
that
he
was
consistent
in
it
and
did
not
convict
himself
of
error
he
was
consistent
in
it
in
spite
of
danger
and
obloquy
evil
days
though
fallen
and
evil
tongues
and
therefore
his
character
has
the
salt
of
honesty
about
it
it
does
not
offend
in
the
nostrils
of
posterity
he
had
taken
his
part
boldly
and
stood
to
it
manfully
and
submitted
to
the
change
of
times
with
pious
fortitude
building
his
consolations
on
the
resources
of
his
own
mind
and
the
recollection
of
the
past
instead
of
endeavouring
to
make
himself
a
retreat
for
the
time
to
come
as
an
instance
of
this
we
may
take
one
of
the
best
and
most
admired
of
these
sonnets
that
addressed
to
cyriac
skinner
on
his
own
blindness
cyriac
this
three
years
day
these
eyes
though
clear
to
outward
view
of
blemish
or
of
spot
bereft
of
light
their
seeing
have
forgot
nor
to
their
idle
orbs
doth
sight
appear
of
sun
or
moon
or
stars
throughout
the
year
or
man
or
woman
yet
i
argue
not
against
hand
or
will
nor
bate
a
jot
of
heart
or
hope
but
still
bear
up
and
steer
right
onward
what
supports
me
dost
thou
ask
the
conscience
friend
to
have
lost
them
in
liberty
defence
my
noble
task
of
which
all
europe
talks
from
side
to
side
this
thought
might
lead
me
through
the
world
vain
mask
content
though
blind
had
i
no
better
guide
nothing
can
exceed
the
mild
subdued
tone
of
this
sonnet
nor
the
striking
grandeur
of
the
concluding
thought
it
is
curious
to
remark
what
seems
to
be
a
trait
of
character
in
the
two
first
lines
from
milton
care
to
inform
the
reader
that
eyes
wore
still
clear
to
outward
view
of
spot
or
blemish
it
would
be
thought
that
he
had
not
yet
given
up
all
regard
to
personal
appearance
a
feeling
to
which
his
singular
beauty
at
an
earlier
age
might
be
supposed
naturally
enough
to
lead
of
the
political
or
what
may
be
called
his
those
to
cromwell
to
fairfax
and
to
the
younger
vane
are
full
of
exalted
praise
and
dignified
advice
they
are
neither
familiar
nor
servile
the
writer
knows
what
is
due
to
power
and
to
fame
he
feels
the
true
unassumed
equality
of
greatness
he
pays
the
full
tribute
of
admiration
for
great
acts
achieved
and
suggests
becoming
occasion
to
deserve
higher
praise
that
to
cromwell
is
a
proof
how
completely
our
poet
maintained
the
erectness
of
his
understanding
and
spirit
in
his
intercourse
with
men
in
power
it
is
such
a
compliment
as
a
poet
might
pay
to
a
conqueror
and
head
of
the
state
without
the
possibility
of
cromwell
our
chief
of
men
who
through
a
cloud
not
of
war
only
but
detractions
rude
guided
by
faith
and
matchless
fortitude
to
peace
and
truth
thy
glorious
way
hast
plough
and
on
the
neck
of
crowned
fortune
proud
hast
rear
god
trophies
and
his
work
pursued
while
darwen
stream
with
blood
of
scots
imbrued
and
dunbar
field
resounds
thy
praises
loud
and
worcester
laureat
wreath
yet
much
remains
to
conquer
still
peace
hath
her
victories
no
less
renown
than
war
new
foes
arise
threatening
to
bind
our
souls
with
secular
chains
help
us
to
save
free
conscience
from
the
paw
of
hireling
wolves
whose
gospel
is
their
maw
the
most
spirited
and
impassioned
of
them
all
and
the
most
inspired
with
a
sort
of
prophetic
fury
is
the
one
entitled
the
late
massacre
in
piedmont
avenge
o
lord
thy
slaughter
saints
whose
bones
lie
scatter
on
the
alpine
mountains
cold
even
them
who
kept
thy
truth
so
pure
of
old
when
all
our
fathers
worshipp
stocks
and
stones
forgot
not
in
thy
book
record
their
groans
who
were
thy
sheep
and
in
their
ancient
fold
slain
by
the
bloody
piedmontese
that
mother
with
infant
down
the
rocks
their
moans
the
vales
redoubled
to
the
hills
and
they
to
their
martyr
blood
and
ashes
sow
all
the
italian
fields
where
still
doth
sway
the
triple
tyrant
that
from
these
may
grow
a
hundred
fold
who
having
learn
thy
way
early
may
fly
the
babylonian
woe
in
the
nineteenth
sonnet
which
is
also
his
blindness
we
see
the
jealous
watchfulness
of
his
mind
over
the
use
of
his
high
gifts
and
the
beautiful
manner
in
which
he
satisfies
himself
that
virtuous
thoughts
and
intentions
are
not
the
least
acceptable
offering
to
the
almighty
when
i
consider
how
my
light
is
spent
ere
half
my
days
in
this
dark
world
and
wide
and
that
one
talent
which
is
death
to
hide
lodged
with
me
useless
though
my
soul
more
bent
to
serve
therewith
my
maker
and
present
my
true
account
lest
he
returning
chide
doth
god
exact
light
denied
i
fondly
ask
but
patience
to
prevent
that
murmur
soon
replies
god
doth
not
need
either
man
work
or
his
own
gifts
who
best
bear
his
mild
yoke
they
serve
him
best
his
state
is
kingly
thousands
at
his
bidding
speed
and
post
land
and
ocean
without
rest
they
also
serve
who
only
stand
and
wait
those
to
henry
lawes
his
airs
and
to
lawrence
can
never
be
enough
admired
they
breathe
the
very
soul
of
music
and
friendship
both
have
a
tender
thoughtful
grace
and
for
their
lightness
with
a
certain
melancholy
complaining
intermixed
might
be
stolen
from
the
harp
of
aeolus
the
last
is
the
picture
of
a
day
spent
in
social
retirement
and
elegant
relaxation
from
severer
studies
we
sit
with
the
poet
at
table
and
hear
his
familiar
sentiments
from
his
own
lips
afterwards
lawrence
of
virtuous
father
virtuous
son
now
that
the
fields
are
dank
and
ways
are
mire
where
shall
we
sometimes
meet
and
by
the
fire
help
waste
a
sullen
day
what
may
be
won
from
the
hard
season
gaining
time
will
run
on
smoother
till
favonius
the
frozen
earth
and
clothe
in
fresh
attire
the
lily
and
rose
that
neither
sow
nor
spun
what
neat
repast
shall
feast
us
light
and
choice
of
attic
taste
with
wine
whence
we
may
rise
to
hear
the
lute
or
artful
voice
warble
immortal
notes
and
tuscan
air
he
who
of
these
delights
can
judge
and
spare
to
interpose
them
oft
is
not
unwise
in
the
last
his
deceased
wife
the
allusion
to
alcestis
is
beautiful
and
shows
how
the
poet
mind
raised
and
refined
his
thoughts
by
exquisite
classical
conceptions
and
how
these
again
were
enriched
by
a
passionate
reference
to
actual
feelings
and
images
it
is
this
rare
union
that
gives
such
voluptuous
dignity
and
touching
purity
to
delineation
of
the
female
character
methought
i
saw
my
late
espoused
saint
brought
to
me
like
alcestis
from
the
grave
whom
jove
great
son
to
her
glad
husband
gave
rescued
from
death
by
force
though
pale
and
faint
mine
as
whom
wash
from
spot
of
taint
purification
in
the
old
law
did
save
and
such
as
yet
once
more
i
trust
to
have
full
sight
of
her
in
without
restraint
came
vested
all
in
white
pure
as
her
mind
her
face
was
veil
yet
to
my
fancied
sight
love
sweetness
goodness
in
her
person
shined
so
clear
as
in
no
face
with
more
delight
but
o
as
to
embrace
me
she
inclined
i
waked
she
fled
and
day
brought
back
my
night
there
could
not
have
been
a
greater
mistake
or
a
more
unjust
piece
of
criticism
than
to
suppose
that
milton
only
shone
on
great
subjects
and
that
on
ordinary
occasions
and
in
familiar
life
his
mind
was
unwieldy
averse
to
the
cultivation
of
grace
and
elegance
and
unsusceptible
of
harmless
pleasures
the
whole
tenor
of
his
smaller
compositions
contradicts
this
opinion
which
however
they
have
been
cited
to
confirm
the
notion
first
got
abroad
from
the
bitterness
or
vehemence
of
his
controversial
writings
and
has
been
kept
up
since
with
little
meaning
and
with
less
truth
his
letters
to
donatus
and
others
are
not
more
remarkable
for
the
display
of
a
scholastic
enthusiasm
than
for
that
of
the
most
amiable
dispositions
they
are
in
youthful
virtue
unreproved
there
is
a
passage
in
his
the
treatise
on
education
which
shows
i
think
his
extreme
openness
and
proneness
to
pleasing
outward
impressions
in
a
striking
point
of
view
to
return
to
our
own
institute
he
says
these
constant
exercises
at
home
there
is
another
opportunity
of
gaining
experience
to
be
won
from
pleasure
itself
abroad
those
vernal
seasons
of
the
year
when
the
air
is
calm
and
pleasant
it
were
an
injury
and
sullenness
against
nature
not
to
go
out
and
see
her
riches
and
partake
in
her
rejoicing
with
heaven
and
i
should
not
therefore
be
a
persuader
to
them
of
studying
much
then
but
to
ride
out
in
companies
with
prudent
and
guides
to
all
quarters
of
the
land
etc
many
other
passages
might
be
quoted
in
which
the
poet
breaks
through
the
groundwork
of
prose
as
it
were
by
natural
fecundity
and
a
genial
unrestrained
sense
of
delight
to
suppose
that
a
poet
is
not
easily
accessible
to
pleasure
or
that
he
does
not
take
an
interest
in
individual
objects
and
feelings
is
to
suppose
that
he
is
no
poet
and
proceeds
on
the
false
theory
which
has
been
so
often
applied
to
poetry
and
the
fine
arts
that
the
whole
is
not
made
up
of
the
particulars
if
our
author
according
to
johnson
s
account
of
him
could
only
have
treated
epic
subjects
he
would
not
have
been
what
he
was
but
another
sir
richard
i
may
conclude
with
observing
that
i
have
often
wished
that
milton
had
lived
to
see
the
revolution
of
this
would
have
been
a
triumph
worthy
of
him
and
which
he
would
have
earned
by
faith
and
hope
he
would
then
have
been
old
but
would
not
have
lived
in
vain
to
see
it
and
might
have
celebrated
the
event
in
one
more
undying

on
going
a
journey
one
of
the
pleasantest
things
in
the
world
is
going
a
journey
but
i
like
to
go
by
myself
i
can
enjoy
society
in
a
room
but
out
of
doors
nature
is
company
enough
for
me
i
am
then
never
less
alone
than
when
alone
the
fields
his
study
nature
was
his
book
i
can
not
see
the
wit
of
walking
and
talking
at
the
same
time
when
i
am
in
the
country
i
wish
to
vegetate
like
the
country
i
am
not
for
criticising
and
black
cattle
i
go
out
of
town
in
order
to
forget
the
town
and
all
that
is
in
it
there
are
those
who
for
this
purpose
go
to
and
carry
the
metropolis
with
them
i
like
more
and
fewer
encumbrances
i
like
solitude
when
i
give
myself
up
to
it
for
the
sake
of
solitude
nor
do
i
ask
for
a
friend
in
my
retreat
whom
i
may
whisper
solitude
is
sweet
the
soul
of
a
journey
is
liberty
perfect
liberty
to
think
feel
do
just
as
one
pleases
we
go
a
journey
chiefly
to
be
free
of
all
impediments
and
of
all
inconveniences
to
leave
ourselves
behind
much
more
to
get
rid
of
others
it
is
because
i
want
a
little
to
muse
on
indifferent
matters
where
contemplation
may
plume
her
feathers
and
let
grow
her
wings
that
in
the
various
bustle
of
resort
were
all
too
ruffled
and
sometimes
impair
that
i
absent
myself
from
the
town
for
a
while
without
feeling
at
a
loss
the
moment
i
am
left
by
myself
instead
of
a
friend
in
a
postchaise
or
in
a
tilbury
to
exchange
good
things
with
and
vary
the
same
stale
topics
over
again
for
once
let
me
have
a
truce
with
impertinence
give
me
the
clear
blue
sky
over
my
head
and
the
green
turf
beneath
my
feet
a
winding
road
before
me
and
a
three
hours
march
to
dinner
and
then
to
thinking
it
is
hard
if
i
can
not
start
some
game
on
these
lone
heaths
i
laugh
i
run
i
leap
i
sing
for
joy
from
the
point
of
yonder
rolling
cloud
i
plunge
into
my
past
being
and
revel
there
as
the
indian
plunges
headlong
into
the
wave
that
wafts
him
to
his
native
shore
then
things
like
wrack
and
sumless
treasuries
burst
upon
my
eager
sight
and
i
begin
to
feel
think
and
be
myself
again
instead
of
an
awkward
silence
broken
by
attempts
at
wit
or
dull
mine
is
that
undisturbed
silence
of
the
heart
which
alone
is
perfect
eloquence
no
one
likes
puns
alliterations
antitheses
argument
and
analysis
better
than
i
do
but
i
sometimes
had
rather
be
without
them
oh
leave
me
to
my
repose
i
have
just
now
other
business
in
hand
which
would
seem
idle
to
you
but
is
with
me
stuff
o
the
conscience
is
not
this
wild
rose
sweet
without
a
comment
does
not
this
daisy
leap
to
my
heart
set
in
its
coat
of
emerald
yet
if
i
were
to
explain
to
you
the
circumstance
that
has
so
endeared
it
to
me
you
would
only
smile
had
i
not
better
then
keep
it
to
myself
and
let
it
serve
me
to
brood
over
from
here
to
yonder
craggy
point
and
from
thence
onward
to
the
horizon
i
should
be
but
bad
company
all
that
way
and
therefore
prefer
being
alone
i
have
heard
it
said
that
you
may
when
the
moody
fit
comes
on
walk
or
ride
on
by
yourself
and
indulge
your
reveries
but
this
looks
like
a
breach
of
manners
a
neglect
of
others
and
you
are
thinking
all
the
time
that
you
ought
to
rejoin
your
party
upon
such
fellowship
say
i
like
to
be
either
entirely
to
myself
or
entirely
at
the
disposal
of
others
to
talk
or
be
silent
to
walk
or
sit
still
to
be
sociable
or
solitary
i
was
pleased
with
an
observation
of
cobbett
that
thought
it
a
bad
french
custom
to
drink
our
wine
with
our
meals
and
that
an
englishman
ought
to
do
only
one
thing
at
a
time
so
i
can
not
talk
and
think
or
indulge
in
melancholy
musing
and
lively
conversation
by
fits
and
starts
me
have
a
companion
of
my
way
says
sterne
it
but
to
remark
how
the
shadows
lengthen
as
the
sun
declines
it
is
beautifully
said
but
in
my
opinion
this
continual
comparing
of
notes
interferes
with
the
involuntary
impression
of
things
upon
the
mind
and
hurts
the
sentiment
if
you
only
hint
what
you
feel
in
a
kind
of
dumb
show
it
is
insipid
if
you
have
to
explain
it
it
is
making
a
toil
of
a
pleasure
you
can
not
read
the
book
of
nature
without
being
perpetually
put
to
the
trouble
of
translating
it
for
the
benefit
of
others
i
am
for
this
synthetical
method
on
a
journey
in
preference
to
the
analytical
i
am
content
to
lay
in
a
stock
of
ideas
then
and
to
examine
and
anatomise
them
afterwards
i
want
to
see
my
vague
notions
float
like
the
down
of
the
thistle
before
the
breeze
and
not
to
have
them
entangled
in
the
briars
and
thorns
of
controversy
for
once
i
like
to
have
it
all
my
own
way
and
this
is
impossible
unless
you
are
alone
or
in
such
company
as
i
do
not
covet
i
have
no
objection
to
argue
a
point
with
any
one
for
twenty
miles
of
measured
road
but
not
for
pleasure
if
you
remark
the
scent
of
a
crossing
the
road
perhaps
your
has
no
smell
if
you
point
to
a
distant
object
perhaps
he
is
and
has
to
take
out
his
glass
to
look
at
it
there
is
a
feeling
in
the
air
a
tone
in
the
colour
of
a
cloud
which
hits
your
fancy
but
the
effect
of
which
you
are
unable
to
account
for
there
is
then
no
sympathy
but
an
uneasy
craving
after
it
and
a
dissatisfaction
which
pursues
you
on
the
way
and
in
the
end
probably
produces
now
i
never
quarrel
with
myself
and
take
all
my
own
conclusions
for
granted
till
i
find
it
necessary
to
defend
them
against
objections
it
is
not
merely
that
you
may
not
be
of
accord
on
the
objects
and
circumstances
that
present
themselves
before
you
these
may
recall
a
number
of
objects
and
lead
to
associations
too
delicate
and
refined
to
be
possibly
communicated
to
others
yet
these
i
love
to
cherish
and
sometimes
still
fondly
clutch
them
when
i
can
escape
from
the
throng
to
do
so
to
give
way
to
our
feelings
before
company
seems
extravagance
or
affectation
and
on
the
other
hand
to
have
to
unravel
this
mystery
of
our
being
at
every
turn
and
to
make
others
take
an
equal
interest
in
it
otherwise
the
end
is
not
answered
is
a
task
to
which
few
are
competent
we
must
it
an
understanding
but
no
tongue
my
old
friend
coleridge
however
could
do
both
he
could
go
on
in
the
most
delightful
explanatory
way
over
hill
and
dale
a
summer
day
and
convert
a
landscape
into
a
didactic
poem
or
a
pindaric
ode
talked
far
above
singing
if
i
could
so
clothe
my
ideas
in
sounding
and
flowing
words
i
might
perhaps
wish
to
have
some
one
with
me
to
admire
the
swelling
theme
or
i
could
be
more
content
were
it
possible
for
me
still
to
hear
his
echoing
voice
in
the
woods
of
they
had
fine
madness
in
them
which
our
first
poets
had
and
if
they
could
have
been
caught
by
some
rare
instrument
would
have
breathed
such
strains
as
the
following
here
be
woods
as
green
as
any
air
likewise
as
fresh
and
sweet
as
when
smooth
zephyrus
plays
on
the
fleet
face
of
the
curled
streams
with
as
many
as
the
young
spring
gives
and
as
choice
as
any
here
be
all
new
delights
cool
streams
and
wells
arbours
with
woodbines
caves
and
dells
choose
where
thou
wilt
whilst
i
sit
by
and
sing
or
gather
rushes
to
make
many
a
ring
for
thy
long
fingers
tell
thee
tales
of
love
how
the
pale
phoebe
hunting
in
a
grove
first
saw
the
boy
endymion
from
whose
eyes
she
took
eternal
fire
that
never
dies
how
she
convey
him
softly
in
a
sleep
his
temples
bound
with
poppy
to
the
steep
head
of
old
latmos
where
she
stoops
each
night
gilding
the
mountain
with
her
brother
light
to
kiss
her
sweetest
had
i
words
and
images
at
command
like
these
i
would
attempt
to
wake
the
thoughts
that
lie
slumbering
on
golden
ridges
in
the
evening
clouds
but
at
the
sight
of
nature
my
fancy
poor
as
it
is
droops
and
closes
up
its
leaves
like
flowers
at
sunset
i
can
make
nothing
out
on
the
spot
i
must
have
time
to
collect
myself
in
general
a
good
thing
spoils
prospects
it
should
be
reserved
for
lamb
is
for
this
reason
i
take
it
the
worst
company
in
the
world
out
of
doors
because
he
is
the
best
within
i
grant
there
is
one
subject
on
which
it
is
pleasant
to
talk
on
a
journey
and
that
is
what
one
shall
have
for
supper
when
we
get
to
our
inn
at
night
the
open
air
improves
this
sort
of
conversation
or
friendly
altercation
by
setting
a
keener
edge
on
appetite
every
mile
of
the
road
heightens
the
flavour
of
the
viands
we
expect
at
the
end
of
it
how
fine
it
is
to
enter
some
old
town
walled
and
turreted
just
at
approach
of
nightfall
or
to
come
to
some
straggling
village
with
the
lights
streaming
through
the
surrounding
gloom
and
then
after
inquiring
for
the
best
entertainment
that
the
place
affords
to
one
ease
at
one
inn
these
eventful
moments
in
our
lives
history
are
too
precious
too
full
of
solid
heartfelt
happiness
to
be
frittered
and
dribbled
away
in
imperfect
sympathy
i
would
have
them
all
to
myself
and
drain
them
to
the
last
drop
they
will
do
to
talk
of
or
to
write
about
afterwards
what
a
delicate
speculation
it
is
after
drinking
whole
goblets
of
tea
the
cups
that
cheer
but
not
inebriate
and
letting
the
fumes
ascend
into
the
brain
to
sit
considering
what
we
shall
have
for
supper
eggs
and
a
rasher
a
rabbit
smothered
in
onions
or
an
excellent
sancho
in
such
a
situation
once
fixed
on
and
his
choice
though
he
could
not
help
it
is
not
to
be
disparaged
then
in
the
intervals
of
pictured
scenery
and
shandean
contemplation
to
catch
the
preparation
and
the
stir
in
the
kitchen
getting
ready
for
the
gentleman
in
the
parlour
o
procul
este
profani
these
hours
are
sacred
to
silence
and
to
musing
to
be
treasured
up
in
the
memory
and
to
feed
the
source
of
smiling
thoughts
hereafter
i
would
not
waste
them
in
idle
talk
or
if
i
must
have
the
integrity
of
fancy
broken
in
upon
i
would
rather
it
were
by
a
stranger
than
a
friend
a
stranger
takes
his
hue
and
character
from
the
time
and
place
he
is
a
part
of
the
furniture
and
costume
of
an
inn
if
he
is
a
quaker
or
from
the
west
riding
of
yorkshire
so
much
the
better
i
do
not
even
try
to
sympathise
with
him
and
he
breaks
no
squares
how
i
love
to
see
the
camps
of
the
gypsies
and
to
sigh
my
soul
into
that
sort
of
life
if
i
express
this
feeling
to
another
he
may
qualify
and
spoil
it
with
some
objection
i
associate
nothing
with
my
travelling
companion
but
present
objects
and
passing
events
in
his
ignorance
of
me
and
my
affairs
i
in
a
manner
forget
myself
but
a
friend
reminds
one
of
other
things
rips
up
old
grievances
and
destroys
the
abstraction
of
the
scene
he
comes
in
ungraciously
between
us
and
our
imaginary
character
something
is
dropped
in
the
course
of
conversation
that
gives
a
hint
of
your
profession
and
pursuits
or
from
having
some
one
with
you
that
knows
the
less
sublime
portions
of
your
history
it
seems
that
other
people
do
you
are
no
longer
a
citizen
of
the
world
but
your
free
condition
is
put
into
circumspection
and
confine
the
incognito
of
an
inn
is
one
of
its
striking
privileges
of
self
uncumbered
with
a
name
oh
it
is
great
to
shake
off
the
trammels
of
the
world
and
of
public
opinion
to
lose
our
importunate
tormenting
everlasting
personal
identity
in
the
elements
of
nature
and
become
the
creature
of
the
moment
clear
of
all
ties
to
hold
to
the
universe
only
by
a
dish
of
sweetbreads
and
to
owe
nothing
but
the
score
of
the
evening
and
no
longer
seeking
for
applause
and
meeting
with
contempt
to
be
known
by
no
other
title
than
gentleman
in
the
parlour
one
may
take
one
choice
of
all
characters
in
this
romantic
state
of
uncertainty
as
to
one
real
pretensions
and
become
indefinitely
respectable
and
negatively
we
baffle
prejudice
and
disappoint
conjecture
and
from
being
so
to
others
begin
to
be
objects
of
curiosity
and
wonder
even
to
ourselves
we
are
no
more
those
hackneyed
that
we
appear
in
the
world
an
inn
restores
us
to
the
level
of
nature
and
quits
scores
with
society
i
have
certainly
spent
some
enviable
hours
at
inns
sometimes
when
i
have
been
left
entirely
to
myself
and
have
tried
to
solve
some
metaphysical
problem
as
once
at
witham
common
where
i
found
out
the
proof
that
likeness
is
not
a
case
of
the
association
of
ideas
at
other
times
when
there
have
been
pictures
in
the
room
as
at
neot
i
think
it
was
where
i
first
met
with
gribelin
engravings
of
the
cartoons
into
which
i
entered
at
once
and
at
a
little
inn
on
the
borders
of
wales
where
there
happened
to
be
hanging
some
of
westall
drawings
which
i
compared
triumphantly
for
a
theory
that
i
had
not
for
the
admired
artist
with
the
figure
of
a
girl
who
had
ferried
me
over
the
severn
standing
up
in
a
boat
between
me
and
the
twilight
at
other
times
i
might
mention
luxuriating
in
books
with
a
peculiar
interest
in
this
way
as
i
remember
sitting
up
half
the
night
to
read
and
virginia
which
i
picked
up
at
an
inn
at
bridgewater
after
being
drenched
in
the
rain
all
day
and
at
the
same
place
i
got
through
two
volumes
of
madame
it
was
on
the
of
april
that
i
sat
down
to
a
volume
of
the
eloise
at
the
inn
at
llangollen
over
a
bottle
of
sherry
and
a
cold
chicken
the
letter
i
chose
was
that
in
which
preux
describes
his
feelings
as
he
first
caught
a
glimpse
from
the
heights
of
the
jura
of
the
pays
de
vaud
which
i
had
brought
with
me
as
a
to
crown
the
evening
with
it
was
my
birthday
and
i
had
for
the
first
time
come
from
a
place
in
the
neighbourhood
to
visit
this
delightful
spot
the
road
to
llangollen
turns
off
between
chirk
and
wrexham
and
on
passing
a
certain
point
you
come
all
at
once
upon
the
valley
which
opens
like
an
amphitheatre
broad
barren
hills
rising
in
majestic
state
on
either
side
with
upland
swells
that
echo
to
the
bleat
of
flocks
below
and
the
river
dee
babbling
over
its
stony
bed
in
the
midst
of
them
the
valley
at
this
time
green
with
sunny
showers
and
a
budding
dipped
its
tender
branches
in
the
chiding
stream
how
proud
how
glad
i
was
to
walk
along
the
high
road
that
overlooks
the
delicious
prospect
repeating
the
lines
which
i
have
just
quoted
from
coleridge
poems
but
besides
the
prospect
which
opened
beneath
my
feet
another
also
opened
to
my
inward
sight
a
heavenly
vision
on
which
were
written
in
letters
large
as
hope
could
make
them
these
four
words
liberty
genius
love
virtue
which
have
since
faded
into
the
light
of
common
day
or
mock
my
idle
gaze
the
beautiful
is
vanished
and
returns
not
still
i
would
return
some
time
or
other
to
this
enchanted
spot
but
i
would
return
to
it
alone
what
other
self
could
i
find
to
share
that
influx
of
thoughts
of
regret
and
delight
the
fragments
of
which
i
could
hardly
conjure
up
to
myself
so
much
have
they
been
broken
and
defaced
i
could
stand
on
some
tall
rock
and
overlook
the
precipice
of
years
that
separates
me
from
what
i
then
was
i
was
at
that
time
going
shortly
to
visit
the
poet
whom
i
have
above
named
where
is
he
now
not
only
i
myself
have
changed
the
world
which
was
then
new
to
me
has
become
old
and
incorrigible
yet
will
i
turn
to
thee
in
thought
o
sylvan
dee
in
joy
in
youth
and
gladness
as
thou
then
wert
and
thou
shalt
always
be
to
me
the
river
of
paradise
where
i
will
drink
of
the
waters
of
life
freely
there
is
hardly
anything
that
shows
the
or
capriciousness
of
the
imagination
more
than
travelling
does
with
change
of
place
we
change
our
ideas
nay
our
opinions
and
feelings
we
can
by
an
effort
indeed
transport
ourselves
to
old
and
scenes
and
then
the
picture
of
the
mind
revives
again
but
we
forget
those
that
we
have
just
left
it
seems
that
we
can
think
but
of
one
place
at
a
time
the
canvas
of
the
fancy
is
but
of
a
certain
extent
and
if
we
paint
one
set
of
objects
upon
it
they
immediately
efface
every
other
we
can
not
enlarge
our
conceptions
we
only
shift
our
point
of
view
the
landscape
bares
its
bosom
to
the
enraptured
eye
we
take
our
fill
of
it
and
seem
as
if
we
could
form
no
other
image
of
beauty
or
grandeur
we
pass
on
and
think
no
more
of
it
the
horizon
that
shuts
it
from
our
sight
also
blots
it
from
our
memory
like
a
dream
in
travelling
through
a
wild
barren
country
i
can
form
no
idea
of
a
woody
and
cultivated
one
it
appears
to
me
that
all
the
world
must
be
barren
like
what
i
see
of
it
in
the
country
we
forget
the
town
and
in
town
we
despise
the
country
hyde
park
says
sir
topling
flutter
is
a
desert
all
that
part
of
the
map
that
we
do
not
see
before
us
is
blank
the
world
in
our
conceit
of
it
is
not
much
bigger
than
a
nutshell
it
is
not
one
prospect
expanded
into
another
county
joined
to
county
kingdom
to
kingdom
land
to
seas
making
an
image
voluminous
and
vast
the
mind
can
form
no
larger
idea
of
space
than
the
eye
can
take
in
at
a
single
glance
the
rest
is
a
name
written
in
a
map
a
calculation
of
arithmetic
for
instance
what
is
the
true
signification
of
that
immense
mass
of
territory
and
population
known
by
the
name
of
china
to
us
an
inch
of
pasteboard
on
a
wooden
globe
of
no
more
account
than
a
china
orange
things
near
us
are
seen
of
the
size
of
life
things
at
a
distance
are
diminished
to
the
size
of
the
understanding
we
measure
the
universe
by
ourselves
and
even
comprehend
the
texture
of
our
being
only
piecemeal
in
this
way
however
we
remember
an
infinity
of
things
and
places
the
mind
is
like
a
mechanical
instrument
that
plays
a
great
variety
of
tunes
but
it
must
play
them
in
succession
one
idea
recalls
another
but
it
at
the
same
time
excludes
all
others
in
trying
to
renew
old
recollections
we
can
not
as
it
were
unfold
the
whole
web
of
our
existence
we
must
pick
out
the
single
threads
so
in
coming
to
a
place
where
we
have
formerly
lived
and
with
which
we
have
intimate
associations
every
one
must
have
found
that
the
feeling
grows
more
vivid
the
nearer
we
approach
the
spot
from
the
mere
anticipation
of
the
actual
impression
we
remember
circumstances
feelings
persons
faces
names
that
we
had
not
thought
of
for
years
but
for
the
time
all
the
rest
of
the
world
is
forgotten
to
return
to
the
question
i
have
quitted
above
i
have
no
objection
to
go
to
see
ruins
aqueducts
pictures
in
company
with
a
friend
or
a
party
but
rather
the
contrary
for
the
former
reason
reversed
they
are
intelligible
matters
and
will
bear
talking
about
the
sentiment
here
is
not
tacit
but
communicable
and
overt
salisbury
plain
is
barren
of
criticism
but
stonehenge
will
bear
a
discussion
antiquarian
picturesque
and
philosophical
in
setting
out
on
a
party
of
pleasure
the
first
consideration
always
is
where
we
shall
go
to
in
taking
a
solitary
ramble
the
question
is
what
we
shall
meet
with
by
the
way
mind
is
its
own
place
nor
are
we
anxious
to
arrive
at
the
end
of
our
journey
i
can
myself
do
the
honours
indifferently
well
to
works
of
art
and
curiosity
i
once
took
a
party
to
oxford
with
no
mean
eclat
showed
them
that
seat
of
the
muses
at
a
distance
with
glistering
spires
and
pinnacles
adorn
descanted
on
the
learned
air
that
breathes
from
the
grassy
quadrangles
and
stone
walls
of
halls
and
colleges
was
at
home
in
the
bodleian
and
at
blenheim
quite
superseded
the
powdered
cicerone
that
attended
us
and
that
pointed
in
vain
with
his
wand
to
commonplace
beauties
in
matchless
pictures
as
another
exception
to
the
above
reasoning
i
should
not
feel
confident
in
venturing
on
a
journey
in
a
foreign
country
without
a
companion
i
should
want
at
intervals
to
hear
the
sound
of
my
own
language
there
is
an
involuntary
antipathy
in
the
mind
of
an
englishman
to
foreign
manners
and
notions
that
requires
the
assistance
of
social
sympathy
to
carry
it
off
as
the
distance
from
home
increases
this
relief
which
was
at
first
a
luxury
becomes
a
passion
and
an
appetite
a
person
would
almost
feel
stifled
to
find
himself
in
the
deserts
of
arabia
without
friends
and
countrymen
there
must
be
allowed
to
be
something
in
the
view
of
athens
or
old
rome
that
claims
the
utterance
of
speech
and
i
own
that
the
pyramids
are
too
mighty
for
any
single
contemplation
in
such
situations
so
opposite
to
all
one
ordinary
train
of
ideas
one
seems
a
species
by
a
limb
torn
off
from
society
unless
one
can
meet
with
instant
fellowship
and
support
yet
i
did
not
feel
this
want
or
craving
very
pressing
once
when
i
first
set
my
foot
on
the
laughing
shores
of
france
calais
was
peopled
with
novelty
and
delight
the
confused
busy
murmur
of
the
place
was
like
oil
and
wine
poured
into
my
ears
nor
did
the
mariners
hymn
which
was
sung
from
the
top
of
an
old
crazy
vessel
in
the
harbour
as
the
sun
went
down
send
an
alien
sound
into
my
soul
i
only
breathed
the
air
of
general
humanity
i
walked
over
hills
and
gay
regions
of
france
erect
and
satisfied
for
the
image
of
man
was
not
cast
down
and
chained
to
the
foot
of
arbitrary
thrones
i
was
at
no
loss
for
language
for
that
of
all
the
great
schools
of
painting
was
open
to
me
the
whole
is
vanished
like
a
shade
pictures
heroes
glory
freedom
all
are
fled
nothing
remains
but
the
bourbons
and
the
french
people
there
is
undoubtedly
a
sensation
in
travelling
into
foreign
parts
that
is
to
be
had
nowhere
else
but
it
is
more
pleasing
at
the
time
than
lasting
it
is
too
remote
from
our
habitual
associations
to
be
a
common
topic
of
discourse
or
reference
and
like
a
dream
or
another
state
of
existence
does
not
piece
into
our
daily
modes
of
life
it
is
an
animated
but
a
momentary
hallucination
it
demands
an
effort
to
exchange
our
actual
for
our
ideal
identity
and
to
feel
the
pulse
of
our
old
transports
revive
very
keenly
we
must
all
our
present
comforts
and
connections
our
romantic
and
itinerant
character
is
not
to
be
domesticated
johnson
remarked
how
little
foreign
travel
added
to
the
facilities
of
conversation
in
those
who
had
been
abroad
in
fact
the
time
we
have
spent
there
is
both
delightful
and
in
one
sense
instructive
but
it
appears
to
be
cut
out
of
our
substantial
downright
existence
and
never
to
join
kindly
on
to
it
we
are
not
the
same
but
another
and
perhaps
more
enviable
individual
all
the
time
we
are
out
of
our
own
country
we
are
lost
to
ourselves
as
well
as
our
friends
so
the
poet
somewhat
quaintly
sings
out
of
my
country
and
myself
i
go
those
who
wish
to
forget
painful
thoughts
do
well
to
absent
themselves
for
a
while
from
the
ties
and
objects
that
recall
them
but
we
can
be
said
only
to
fulfil
our
destiny
in
the
place
that
gave
us
birth
i
should
on
this
account
like
well
enough
to
spend
the
whole
of
my
life
in
travelling
abroad
if
i
could
anywhere
borrow
another
life
to
spend

on
politicians
there
is
a
set
of
people
who
fairly
come
under
this
denomination
they
spend
their
time
and
their
breath
in
and
other
places
of
public
resort
hearing
or
repeating
some
new
thing
they
sit
with
a
paper
in
their
hands
in
the
morning
and
with
a
pipe
in
their
mouths
in
the
evening
discussing
the
contents
of
it
the
the
chronicle
and
the
are
necessary
to
their
existence
in
them
live
and
move
and
have
their
being
the
evening
paper
is
impatiently
expected
and
called
for
at
a
certain
critical
minute
the
news
of
the
morning
becomes
stale
and
vapid
by
the
a
fresher
interest
is
required
an
appetite
for
the
information
is
excited
with
the
return
of
their
meals
and
a
glass
of
old
port
or
humming
ale
hardly
relishes
as
it
ought
without
the
infusion
of
some
lively
topic
that
had
its
birth
with
the
day
and
perishes
before
night
come
in
the
sweets
of
the
evening
the
queen
the
coronation
the
last
new
play
the
next
fight
the
insurrection
of
the
greeks
or
neapolitans
the
price
of
stocks
or
death
of
kings
keep
them
on
the
alert
till
bedtime
no
question
comes
amiss
to
them
that
is
quite
new
none
is
ever
heard
of
that
is
at
all
old
that
of
an
hour
age
doth
hiss
the
speaker
the
world
before
the
flood
or
the
intermediate
state
of
the
soul
are
never
once
thought
of
such
is
the
quick
succession
of
subjects
the
suddenness
and
fugitiveness
of
the
interest
taken
in
them
that
the
post
would
be
at
present
looked
upon
as
an
publication
and
the
battle
of
waterloo
like
the
proverb
is
somewhat
musty
it
is
strange
that
people
should
take
so
much
interest
at
one
time
in
what
they
so
soon
forget
the
truth
is
they
feel
no
interest
in
it
at
any
time
but
it
does
for
something
to
talk
about
their
ideas
are
served
up
to
them
like
their
bill
of
fare
for
the
day
and
the
whole
creation
history
war
politics
morals
poetry
metaphysics
is
to
them
like
a
file
of
antedated
newspapers
of
no
use
not
even
for
reference
except
the
one
which
lies
on
the
table
you
can
not
take
any
of
these
persons
at
a
greater
disadvantage
than
before
they
are
provided
with
their
cue
for
the
day
they
ask
with
a
face
of
dreary
vacuity
you
anything
new
and
on
receiving
an
answer
in
the
negative
have
nothing
further
to
say
they
are
like
an
oyster
at
the
ebb
of
the
tide
gaping
for
fresh
talk
of
the
westminster
election
the
bridge
street
association
or
cobbett
letter
to
john
cropper
of
liverpool
and
they
are
alive
again
beyond
the
last
hours
or
the
narrow
round
in
which
they
move
they
are
utterly
to
seek
without
ideas
feelings
interests
apprehensions
of
any
sort
so
that
if
you
betray
any
knowledge
beyond
the
vulgar
routine
of
second
editions
and
private
intelligence
you
pass
with
them
for
a
dull
fellow
not
acquainted
with
what
is
going
forward
in
the
world
or
with
the
practical
value
of
things
i
have
known
a
person
of
this
stamp
censure
john
cam
hobhouse
for
referring
so
often
as
he
does
to
the
affairs
of
the
greeks
and
romans
as
if
the
affairs
of
the
nation
were
not
sufficient
for
his
hands
another
asks
you
if
a
general
in
modern
times
can
not
throw
a
bridge
over
a
river
without
having
studied
and
a
third
can
not
see
the
use
of
the
learned
languages
as
he
has
observed
that
the
greatest
proficients
in
them
are
rather
taciturn
than
otherwise
and
hesitate
in
their
speech
more
than
other
people
a
dearth
of
general
information
is
almost
necessary
to
the
politician
in
the
absence
of
thought
imagination
sentiment
he
is
attracted
immediately
to
the
nearest
commonplace
and
floats
through
the
chosen
regions
of
noise
and
empty
rumours
without
difficulty
and
without
distraction
meet
six
of
these
men
in
buckram
and
they
will
accost
you
with
the
same
question
and
the
same
answer
they
have
seen
it
somewhere
in
print
or
had
it
from
some
city
oracle
that
morning
and
the
sooner
they
vent
their
opinions
the
better
for
they
will
not
keep
like
tickets
of
admission
to
the
theatre
for
a
particular
evening
they
must
be
used
immediately
or
they
will
be
worth
nothing
and
the
object
is
to
find
auditors
for
the
one
and
customers
for
the
other
neither
of
which
is
difficult
since
people
who
have
no
ideas
of
their
own
are
glad
to
hear
what
any
one
else
has
to
say
as
those
who
have
not
free
admissions
to
the
play
will
very
obligingly
take
up
with
an
occasional
order
it
sometimes
gives
one
a
melancholy
but
mixed
sensation
to
see
one
of
the
better
sort
of
this
class
of
politicians
not
without
talents
or
learning
absorbed
for
fifty
years
together
in
the
topic
of
the
day
mounting
on
it
for
exercise
and
recreation
of
his
faculties
like
the
great
horse
at
a
and
after
his
short
improgressive
untired
career
dismounting
just
where
he
got
up
flying
abroad
in
continual
consternation
on
the
wings
of
all
the
newspapers
waving
his
arm
like
a
in
sign
of
constant
change
and
spouting
out
torrents
of
puddled
politics
from
his
mouth
dead
to
all
interests
but
those
of
the
state
seemingly
neither
older
nor
wiser
for
age
unaccountably
enthusiastic
stupidly
romantic
and
actuated
by
no
other
motive
than
the
mechanical
operations
of
the
spirit
of
newsmongering
things
exclaims
beaumont
in
his
verses
to
ben
jonson
we
not
seen
done
at
the
mermaid
when
there
hath
been
thrown
wit
able
enough
to
justify
the
town
for
three
days
past
wit
that
might
warrant
be
for
the
whole
city
to
talk
foolishly
i
can
not
say
the
same
of
the
southampton
though
it
stands
on
classic
ground
and
is
connected
by
vocal
tradition
with
the
great
names
of
the
elizabethan
age
what
a
falling
off
is
here
our
ancestors
of
that
period
seem
not
only
to
be
older
by
two
hundred
years
and
proportionably
wiser
and
wittier
than
we
but
hardly
a
trace
of
them
is
left
not
even
the
memory
of
what
has
been
how
should
i
make
my
friend
mounsey
stare
if
i
were
to
mention
the
name
of
my
still
better
friend
old
honest
signor
friscobaldo
the
father
of
bellafront
yet
his
name
was
perhaps
invented
and
the
scenes
in
which
he
figures
unrivalled
might
for
the
first
time
have
been
read
aloud
to
thrilling
ears
on
this
very
spot
who
reads
decker
now
or
if
by
chance
any
one
awakes
the
strings
of
that
ancient
lyre
and
starts
with
delight
as
they
yield
wild
broken
music
is
he
not
accused
of
envy
to
the
living
muse
what
would
a
from
holborn
think
if
i
were
to
ask
him
after
the
clerk
of
andrew
the
immortal
the
forgotten
webster
his
name
and
his
works
are
no
more
heard
of
though
were
written
with
a
pen
of
adamant
the
tables
of
the
heart
his
fame
was
in
water
so
perishable
is
genius
so
swift
is
time
so
fluctuating
is
knowledge
and
so
far
is
it
from
being
true
that
men
perpetually
accumulate
the
means
of
improvement
and
refinement
on
the
contrary
living
knowledge
is
the
tomb
of
the
dead
and
while
light
and
worthless
materials
float
on
the
surface
the
solid
and
sterling
as
often
sink
to
the
bottom
and
are
swallowed
up
for
ever
in
weeds
and
quicksands
a
striking
instance
of
the
nature
of
popular
reputation
occurred
one
evening
at
the
southampton
when
we
got
into
a
dispute
the
most
learned
and
recondite
that
over
took
place
on
the
comparative
merits
of
lord
byron
and
gray
a
country
gentleman
happened
to
drop
in
and
thinking
to
show
off
in
london
company
launched
into
a
lofty
panegyric
on
of
gray
as
the
sublimest
composition
in
the
english
language
this
assertion
presently
appeared
to
be
an
anachronism
though
it
was
probably
the
opinion
in
vogue
thirty
years
ago
when
the
gentleman
was
last
in
town
after
a
little
floundering
one
of
the
party
volunteered
to
express
a
more
contemporary
sentiment
by
asking
in
a
tone
of
mingled
confidence
and
doubt
you
think
sir
that
gray
is
to
be
mentioned
as
a
poet
in
the
same
day
with
my
lord
byron
the
disputants
were
now
at
issue
all
that
resulted
was
that
gray
was
set
aside
as
a
poet
who
would
not
go
down
among
readers
of
the
present
day
and
his
patron
treated
the
works
of
the
noble
bard
as
mere
ephemeral
effusions
and
spoke
of
poets
that
would
be
admired
thirty
years
hence
which
was
the
farthest
stretch
of
his
critical
imagination
his
antagonist
did
not
even
reach
so
far
this
was
the
most
romantic
digression
we
ever
had
and
the
subject
was
not
afterwards
no
one
here
generally
speaking
has
the
slightest
notion
of
anything
that
has
happened
that
has
been
said
thought
or
done
out
of
his
own
recollection
it
would
be
in
vain
to
hearken
after
those
those
sublunary
things
which
were
the
employment
and
delight
of
the
beaumonts
and
bens
of
former
times
but
we
may
happily
repose
on
dulness
drift
with
the
tide
of
nonsense
and
gain
an
agreeable
vertigo
by
lending
an
ear
to
endless
controversies
the
confusion
provided
you
do
not
mingle
in
the
fray
and
try
to
disentangle
it
is
amusing
and
edifying
enough
every
species
of
false
wit
and
spurious
argument
may
be
learnt
here
by
potent
examples
whatever
observations
you
hear
dropt
have
been
picked
up
in
the
same
place
or
in
a
kindred
atmosphere
there
is
a
kind
of
conversation
made
up
entirely
of
scraps
and
hearsay
as
there
are
a
kind
of
books
made
up
entirely
of
references
to
other
books
this
may
account
for
the
frequent
contradictions
which
abound
in
the
discourse
of
persons
educated
and
disciplined
wholly
in
there
is
nothing
stable
or
in
it
it
is
but
vanity
chaotic
vanity
they
hear
a
remark
at
the
globe
which
they
do
not
know
what
to
make
of
another
at
the
rainbow
in
direct
opposition
to
it
and
not
having
time
to
reconcile
them
vent
both
at
the
mitre
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
if
they
are
not
more
than
ordinarily
dull
you
are
sure
to
find
them
on
opposite
sides
of
the
question
this
is
the
sickening
part
of
it
people
do
not
seem
to
talk
for
the
sake
of
expressing
their
opinions
but
to
maintain
an
opinion
for
the
sake
of
talking
we
meet
neither
with
modest
ignorance
nor
studious
acquirement
their
knowledge
has
been
taken
in
too
much
by
snatches
to
digest
properly
there
is
neither
sincerity
nor
system
in
what
they
say
they
hazard
the
first
crude
notion
that
comes
to
hand
and
then
defend
it
how
they
can
which
is
for
the
most
part
but
you
think
says
mounsey
is
a
very
sensible
man
no
i
say
seems
to
me
to
have
no
ideas
of
his
own
and
only
to
wait
to
see
what
others
will
say
in
order
to
set
himself
against
it
i
should
not
think
that
is
the
way
to
get
at
the
truth
i
do
not
desire
to
be
driven
out
of
my
conclusions
such
as
they
are
merely
to
make
way
for
his
upstart
pretensions
there
is
what
of
him
might
very
well
express
all
he
has
to
say
in
half
the
time
and
with
half
the
trouble
why
should
he
beat
about
the
bush
as
he
does
he
appears
to
be
getting
up
a
little
speech
and
practising
on
a
smaller
scale
for
a
debating
society
the
lowest
ambition
a
man
can
have
besides
by
his
manner
of
drawling
out
his
words
and
interlarding
his
periods
with
innuendos
and
formal
reservations
he
is
evidently
making
up
his
mind
all
the
time
which
side
he
shall
take
he
puts
his
sentences
together
as
printers
set
up
types
letter
by
letter
there
is
certainly
no
principle
of
in
his
mode
of
elocution
he
goes
round
for
a
meaning
and
the
sense
waits
for
him
it
is
not
conversation
but
rehearsing
a
part
men
of
education
and
men
of
the
world
order
this
matter
better
they
know
what
they
have
to
say
on
a
subject
and
come
to
the
point
at
once
your
politician
balances
between
what
he
heard
last
and
what
he
shall
say
next
and
not
seeing
his
way
clearly
puts
you
off
with
circumstantial
phrases
and
tries
to
gain
time
for
fear
of
making
a
false
step
this
gentleman
has
heard
some
one
admired
for
precision
and
copiousness
of
language
and
goes
away
congratulating
himself
that
he
has
not
made
a
blunder
in
grammar
or
in
rhetoric
the
whole
evening
he
is
a
theoretical
is
tenacious
in
argument
though
wary
carries
his
point
thus
and
thus
bandies
objections
and
answers
with
uneasy
pleasantry
and
when
he
has
the
worst
of
the
dispute
puns
very
emphatically
on
his
adversary
name
if
it
admits
of
that
kind
of
misconstruction
george
kirkpatrick
is
admired
by
the
waiter
who
is
a
sleek
hand
for
his
temper
in
managing
an
argument
any
one
else
would
perceive
that
the
latent
cause
is
not
patience
with
his
antagonist
but
satisfaction
with
himself
i
think
this
unmoved
this
cavalier
smooth
simpering
indifference
is
more
annoying
than
the
extremest
violence
or
irritability
the
one
shows
that
your
opponent
does
care
something
about
you
and
may
be
put
out
of
his
way
by
your
remarks
the
other
seems
to
announce
that
nothing
you
say
can
shake
his
opinion
a
jot
that
he
has
considered
the
whole
of
what
you
have
to
offer
beforehand
and
that
he
is
in
all
respects
much
wiser
and
more
accomplished
than
you
such
persons
talk
to
grown
people
with
the
same
air
of
patronage
and
condescension
that
they
do
to
children
will
explain
is
a
familiar
expression
with
them
thinking
you
can
only
differ
from
them
in
consequence
of
misconceiving
what
they
say
or
if
you
detect
them
in
any
error
in
point
of
fact
as
to
acknowledged
deficiency
in
wit
or
argument
they
would
smile
at
the
idea
they
add
some
correction
to
your
correction
and
thus
have
the
of
you
again
being
more
correct
than
you
who
corrected
them
if
you
hint
some
obvious
oversight
they
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
and
were
aware
of
the
objection
before
you
uttered
it
shall
their
anticipation
prevent
your
discovery
by
being
in
the
right
you
gain
no
advantage
by
being
in
the
wrong
you
are
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
their
pity
or
scorn
it
is
sometimes
curious
to
see
a
select
group
of
our
little
gotham
getting
about
a
knotty
point
that
will
bear
a
wager
as
whether
johnson
dictionary
was
originally
published
in
quarto
or
folio
the
confident
assertions
the
cautious
overtures
the
length
of
time
demanded
to
ascertain
the
fact
the
precise
terms
of
the
forfeit
the
provisos
for
getting
out
of
paying
it
at
last
lead
to
a
long
and
inextricable
discussion
george
kirkpatrick
was
however
so
convinced
in
his
own
mind
that
the
was
written
by
shakespear
that
he
ran
headlong
into
the
snare
the
bet
was
decided
and
the
punch
was
drunk
he
has
skill
in
numbers
and
seldom
exceeds
his
he
had
a
brother
once
no
michael
cassio
no
great
arithmetician
roger
kirkpatrick
was
a
rare
fellow
of
the
driest
humour
and
the
nicest
tact
of
infinite
sleights
and
evasions
of
a
picked
phraseology
and
the
very
soul
of
mimicry
i
fancy
i
have
some
insight
into
physiognomy
myself
but
he
could
often
expound
to
me
at
a
single
glance
the
characters
of
those
of
my
acquaintance
that
i
had
been
most
at
fault
about
the
account
as
it
was
cast
up
and
balanced
between
us
was
not
always
very
favourable
how
finely
how
truly
how
gaily
he
took
off
the
company
at
the
southampton
poor
and
faint
are
my
sketches
compared
to
his
it
was
like
looking
into
a
you
saw
faces
shining
and
speaking
the
smoke
curled
the
lights
dazzled
the
oak
wainscotting
took
a
higher
polish
there
was
old
sarratt
tall
and
gaunt
with
his
couplet
from
pope
and
case
at
nisi
prius
mounsey
eyeing
the
ventilator
and
lying
for
a
moral
and
hume
and
ayrton
taking
another
friendly
finishing
glass
these
and
many
more
windfalls
of
character
he
gave
us
in
thought
word
and
action
i
remember
his
once
describing
three
different
persons
together
to
myself
and
martin
burney
viz
the
manager
of
a
country
theatre
a
tragic
and
a
comic
performer
till
we
were
ready
to
tumble
on
the
floor
with
laughing
at
the
oddity
of
their
humours
and
at
roger
extraordinary
powers
of
ventriloquism
bodily
and
mental
and
burney
said
such
was
the
vividness
of
the
scene
that
when
he
awoke
the
next
morning
he
wondered
what
three
amusing
characters
he
had
been
in
company
with
the
evening
before
oh
it
was
a
rich
treat
to
see
him
describe
mudford
him
of
the
the
contemplative
man
who
wrote
an
answer
to
coelebs
coming
into
a
room
folding
up
his
greatcoat
taking
out
a
little
pocket
volume
laying
it
down
to
think
rubbing
the
calf
of
his
leg
with
grave
and
starting
out
of
his
reverie
when
spoken
to
with
an
inimitable
vapid
exclamation
of
mudford
is
like
a
man
made
of
fleecy
hosiery
roger
was
lank
and
lean
is
the
ribbed
yet
he
seemed
the
very
man
he
represented
as
fat
pert
and
dull
as
it
was
possible
to
be
i
have
not
seen
him
of
late
for
kais
is
fled
and
our
tents
are
forlorn
but
i
thought
of
him
the
other
day
when
the
news
of
the
death
of
buonaparte
came
whom
we
both
loved
for
precisely
contrary
reasons
he
for
putting
down
the
rabble
of
the
people
and
i
because
he
had
put
down
the
rabble
of
kings
perhaps
this
event
may
rouse
him
from
his
where
he
lies
like
reynard
head
declined
in
feigned
slumbers
i
had
almost
forgotten
the
southampton
tavern
we
for
some
time
took
c
for
a
lawyer
from
a
certain
arguteness
of
voice
and
slenderness
of
neck
and
from
his
having
a
quibble
and
a
laugh
at
himself
always
ready
on
inquiry
however
he
was
found
to
be
a
seller
and
having
leisure
in
his
apprenticeship
and
a
forwardness
of
parts
he
had
taken
to
study
blackstone
and
the
at
on
appealing
to
mounsey
for
his
opinion
on
this
matter
he
observed
pithily
like
so
much
law
the
gentlemen
here
seem
fond
of
law
but
i
have
law
enough
at
chambers
one
sees
a
great
deal
of
the
humours
and
tempers
of
men
in
a
place
of
this
sort
and
may
almost
gather
their
opinions
from
their
characters
there
is
c
a
fellow
that
is
always
in
the
wrong
who
puts
might
for
right
on
all
occasions
a
tory
in
grain
who
has
no
one
idea
but
what
has
been
instilled
into
him
by
custom
and
authority
an
everlasting
babbler
on
the
stronger
side
of
the
question
querulous
and
dictatorial
and
with
a
peevish
whine
in
his
voice
like
a
beaten
schoolboy
he
is
a
great
advocate
for
the
bourbons
and
for
the
national
debt
the
former
he
affirms
to
be
the
choice
of
the
french
people
and
the
latter
he
insists
is
necessary
to
the
salvation
of
these
kingdoms
this
last
point
a
little
inoffensive
gentleman
among
us
of
a
saturnine
aspect
but
simple
conceptions
can
not
comprehend
will
tell
you
sir
i
will
make
my
propositions
so
clear
that
you
will
be
convinced
of
the
truth
of
my
observation
in
a
moment
consider
sir
the
number
of
trades
that
would
be
thrown
out
of
employ
if
it
were
done
away
with
what
would
become
of
the
porcelain
manufacture
without
it
any
stranger
to
overhear
one
of
these
debates
would
swear
that
the
english
as
a
nation
are
bad
logicians
mood
and
figure
are
unknown
to
them
they
do
not
argue
by
the
book
they
arrive
at
conclusions
through
the
force
of
prejudice
and
on
the
principles
of
contradiction
c
having
thus
triumphed
in
argument
offers
a
flower
to
the
notice
of
the
company
as
a
specimen
of
his
a
curious
exotic
nothing
like
it
to
be
found
in
this
kingdom
talks
of
his
carnations
of
his
and
old
english
hospitality
but
never
invites
any
of
his
friends
to
come
down
and
take
their
sunday
dinner
with
him
he
is
mean
and
ostentatious
at
the
same
time
insolent
and
servile
does
not
know
whether
to
treat
those
he
converses
with
as
if
they
were
his
porters
or
his
customers
the
is
not
yet
wiped
out
of
him
and
his
imagination
still
hovers
between
his
mansion
at
and
the
workhouse
opposed
to
him
and
to
every
one
else
is
a
radical
reformer
and
logician
who
makes
clear
work
of
the
taxes
and
national
debt
reconstructs
the
government
from
the
first
principles
of
things
shatters
the
holy
alliance
at
a
blow
grinds
out
the
future
prospects
of
society
with
a
machine
and
is
setting
out
afresh
with
the
commencement
of
the
french
revolution
five
and
twenty
years
ago
as
if
on
an
untried
experiment
he
minds
nothing
but
the
formal
agreement
of
his
premises
and
his
conclusions
and
does
not
stick
at
obstacles
in
the
way
nor
consequences
in
the
end
if
there
was
but
one
side
of
a
question
he
would
be
always
in
the
right
he
casts
up
one
column
of
the
account
to
admiration
but
totally
forgets
and
rejects
the
other
his
ideas
lie
like
square
pieces
of
wood
in
his
brain
and
may
be
said
to
be
piled
up
on
a
stiff
architectural
principle
perpendicularly
and
at
right
angles
there
is
no
inflection
no
modification
no
graceful
embellishment
no
corinthian
capitals
i
never
heard
him
agree
to
two
propositions
together
or
to
more
than
half
a
one
at
a
time
his
rigid
love
of
truth
bends
to
nothing
but
his
habitual
love
of
disputation
he
puts
one
in
mind
of
one
of
those
politicians
and
frequenters
of
mentioned
in
berkeley
philosopher
who
would
make
nothing
of
such
fellows
as
plato
and
aristotle
he
has
the
new
light
strong
upon
him
and
he
knocks
other
people
down
with
its
solid
beams
he
denies
that
he
has
got
certain
views
out
of
cobbett
though
he
allows
that
there
are
excellent
ideas
occasionally
to
be
met
with
in
that
writer
it
is
a
pity
that
this
enthusiastic
and
unqualified
regard
to
truth
should
be
accompanied
with
an
equal
exactness
of
expenditure
and
unrelenting
eye
to
the
main
chance
he
brings
a
bunch
of
radishes
with
him
for
cheapness
and
gives
a
band
of
musicians
at
the
door
a
penny
observing
that
he
likes
their
performance
better
than
all
the
opera
squalling
this
brings
the
severity
of
his
political
principles
into
question
if
not
into
contempt
he
would
abolish
the
national
debt
from
motives
of
personal
economy
and
objects
to
canning
pension
because
it
perhaps
takes
a
farthing
a
year
out
of
his
own
pocket
a
great
deal
of
radical
reasoning
has
its
source
in
this
he
bestows
no
small
quantity
of
his
tediousness
upon
mounsey
on
whose
mind
all
these
formulas
and
diagrams
fall
like
seed
on
stony
ground
the
manna
is
descending
he
shakes
his
ears
and
in
the
intervals
of
the
debate
insinuates
an
objection
and
calls
for
another
i
have
sometimes
said
to
him
one
to
come
in
here
without
knowing
you
would
take
you
for
the
most
disputatious
man
alive
for
you
are
always
engaged
in
an
argument
with
somebody
or
other
the
truth
is
that
mounsey
is
a
gentlemanly
man
who
notwithstanding
if
appealed
to
will
not
let
an
absurd
or
unjust
proposition
pass
without
expressing
his
dissent
and
therefore
he
is
a
sort
of
mark
for
all
those
and
we
have
several
of
that
stamp
who
like
to
tease
other
people
understandings
as
tease
wool
he
is
certainly
the
flower
of
the
flock
he
is
the
oldest
frequenter
of
the
place
the
latest
inobtrusive
and
that
sturdy
old
english
character
a
lover
of
truth
and
justice
i
never
knew
mounsey
approve
of
anything
unfair
or
illiberal
there
is
a
candour
and
uprightness
about
his
mind
which
can
neither
be
wheedled
nor
browbeat
into
unjustifiable
complaisance
he
looks
straight
forward
as
he
sits
with
his
glass
in
his
hand
turning
neither
to
the
right
nor
the
left
and
i
will
venture
to
say
that
he
has
never
had
a
sinister
object
in
view
through
life
battle
it
is
recorded
in
her
opinions
on
whist
could
not
make
up
her
mind
to
use
the
word
mounsey
from
long
practice
has
got
over
this
difficulty
and
uses
it
incessantly
it
is
no
matter
what
adjunct
follows
in
the
train
of
this
despised
monosyllable
whatever
liquid
comes
after
this
prefix
is
welcome
mounsey
without
being
the
most
communicative
is
the
most
conversible
man
i
know
the
social
principle
is
inseparable
from
his
person
if
he
has
nothing
to
say
he
drinks
your
health
and
when
you
can
not
from
the
rapidity
and
carelessness
of
his
utterance
catch
what
he
says
you
assent
to
it
with
equal
confidence
you
know
his
meaning
is
good
his
favourite
phrase
is
have
all
of
us
something
of
the
coxcomb
and
yet
he
has
none
of
it
himself
before
i
had
exchanged
half
a
dozen
sentences
with
mounsey
i
found
that
he
knew
several
of
my
old
acquaintance
an
immediate
introduction
of
itself
for
the
discussing
the
characters
and
foibles
of
common
friends
is
a
great
sweetener
and
cement
of
friendship
and
had
been
intimate
with
most
of
the
wits
and
men
about
town
for
the
last
twenty
years
he
knew
tobin
wordsworth
porson
wilson
paley
erskine
and
many
others
he
speaks
of
pleasantry
and
unassuming
manners
and
describes
porson
long
potations
and
long
quotations
formerly
at
the
cider
cellar
in
a
very
lively
way
he
has
doubts
however
as
to
that
sort
of
learning
on
my
saying
that
i
had
never
seen
the
greek
professor
but
once
at
the
library
of
the
london
institution
when
he
was
dressed
in
an
old
rusty
black
coat
with
cobwebs
hanging
to
the
skirts
of
it
and
with
a
large
patch
of
coarse
brown
paper
covering
the
whole
length
of
his
nose
looking
for
all
the
world
like
a
drunken
carpenter
and
talking
to
one
of
the
proprietors
with
an
air
of
suavity
approaching
to
condescension
mounsey
could
not
help
expressing
some
little
uneasiness
for
the
credit
of
classical
literature
submit
sir
whether
common
sense
is
not
the
principal
thing
what
is
the
advantage
of
genius
and
learning
if
they
are
of
no
use
in
the
conduct
of
life
mounsey
is
one
who
loves
the
hours
that
usher
in
the
morn
when
a
select
few
are
left
in
twos
and
threes
like
stars
before
the
break
of
day
and
when
the
discourse
and
the
ale
are
growing
better
and
better
wells
mounsey
and
myself
were
all
that
remained
one
evening
we
had
sat
together
several
hours
without
being
tired
of
one
another
company
the
conversation
turned
on
the
beauties
of
charles
the
second
court
at
windsor
and
from
thence
to
count
grammont
their
gallant
and
gay
historian
we
took
our
favourite
passages
in
turn
one
preferring
that
of
killigrew
country
cousin
who
having
been
resolutely
refused
by
miss
warminster
one
of
the
maids
of
honour
when
he
found
she
had
been
unexpectedly
brought
to
bed
fell
on
his
knees
and
thanked
god
that
now
she
might
take
compassion
on
him
another
insisting
that
the
chevalier
hamilton
assignation
with
lady
chesterfield
when
she
kept
him
all
night
shivering
in
an
old
was
better
jacob
hall
prowess
was
not
forgotten
nor
the
story
of
miss
stuart
garters
i
was
getting
on
in
my
way
with
that
delicate
in
which
miss
churchill
is
first
introduced
at
court
and
is
besieged
as
a
matter
of
course
by
the
duke
of
york
who
was
gallant
as
well
as
bigoted
on
system
his
assiduities
however
soon
slackened
owing
it
is
said
to
her
having
a
pale
thin
face
till
one
day
as
they
were
riding
out
hunting
together
she
fell
from
her
horse
and
was
taken
up
almost
lifeless
the
whole
assembled
court
was
thrown
by
this
event
into
admiration
that
such
a
body
should
belong
to
such
a
face
so
transcendent
a
pattern
was
she
of
the
female
form
and
the
duke
was
fixed
this
i
contended
was
striking
affecting
and
grand
the
sublime
of
amorous
biography
and
said
i
could
conceive
of
nothing
finer
than
the
idea
of
a
young
person
in
her
situation
who
was
the
object
of
indifference
or
scorn
from
outward
appearance
with
the
proud
suppressed
consciousness
of
a
symmetry
locked
up
by
and
niceness
the
handmaids
of
all
women
from
the
wonder
and
worship
of
mankind
i
said
so
then
and
i
think
so
now
my
tongue
grew
wanton
in
the
praise
of
this
passage
and
i
believe
it
bore
the
bell
from
its
competitors
wells
then
spoke
of
lucius
apuleius
and
his
golden
ass
which
contains
the
story
of
cupid
and
psyche
with
other
matter
rich
and
rare
and
went
on
to
the
romance
of
heliodorus
theagenes
and
chariclea
and
in
it
the
presiding
deities
of
love
and
wine
appear
in
all
their
pristine
strength
youth
and
grace
crowned
and
worshipped
as
of
yore
the
night
waned
but
our
glasses
brightened
enriched
with
the
pearls
of
grecian
story
our
slept
in
a
corner
of
the
room
like
another
endymion
in
the
pale
ray
of
a
lamp
and
starting
up
at
a
fresh
summons
for
a
further
supply
he
swore
it
was
too
late
and
was
inexorable
to
entreaty
mounsey
sat
with
his
hat
on
and
with
a
hectic
flush
in
his
face
while
any
hope
remained
but
as
soon
as
we
rose
to
go
he
darted
out
of
the
room
as
quick
as
lightning
determined
not
to
be
the
last
that
i
said
some
time
after
to
the
waiter
that
mounsey
was
no
flincher
sir
says
he
should
have
known
him
formerly
when
hume
and
ayrton
used
to
be
here
now
he
is
quite
another
man
he
seldom
stays
later
than
one
or
two
did
they
keep
it
up
much
then
yes
and
used
to
sing
catches
and
all
sorts
did
mounsey
sing
catches
joined
chorus
sir
and
was
as
merry
as
the
best
of
them
he
was
always
a
pleasant
gentleman
this
hume
and
ayrton
succumbed
in
the
fight
ayrton
was
a
dry
scotchman
hume
a
hearty
englishman
i
do
not
mean
that
the
same
character
applies
to
all
scotchmen
or
to
all
englishmen
hume
was
of
the
not
unfitly
appointed
and
in
his
cheerfuller
cups
would
delight
to
speak
of
a
widow
and
a
that
ran
in
his
head
to
the
last
is
the
good
of
talking
of
those
things
now
said
the
man
of
utility
do
know
replied
the
other
quaffing
another
glass
of
sparkling
ale
and
with
a
lambent
fire
playing
in
his
eye
and
round
his
bald
forehead
he
had
a
head
that
sir
joshua
would
have
made
something
bland
and
genial
of
do
know
but
they
were
delightful
to
me
at
the
time
and
are
still
pleasant
to
talk
and
think
of
a
one
in
touchstone
phrase
a
natural
philosopher
and
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
that
sort
of
philosophy
is
the
best
i
could
enlarge
this
sketch
such
as
it
is
but
to
prose
on
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
might
prove
less
profitable
than
tedious
i
like
very
well
to
sit
in
a
room
where
there
are
people
talking
on
subjects
i
know
nothing
of
if
i
am
only
allowed
to
sit
silent
and
as
a
spectator
but
i
do
not
much
like
to
join
in
the
conversation
except
with
people
and
on
subjects
to
my
taste
sympathy
is
necessary
to
society
to
look
on
a
variety
of
faces
humours
and
opinions
is
sufficient
to
mix
with
others
agreement
as
well
as
variety
is
indispensable
what
makes
good
society
i
answer
in
one
word
real
fellowship
without
a
similitude
of
tastes
acquirements
and
pursuits
whatever
may
be
the
difference
of
tempers
and
characters
there
can
be
no
intimacy
or
even
casual
intercourse
worth
the
having
what
makes
the
most
agreeable
party
a
number
of
people
with
a
number
of
ideas
in
common
so
as
with
a
difference
that
is
who
can
put
one
or
more
subjects
which
they
have
all
studied
in
the
greatest
variety
of
entertaining
or
useful
lights
or
in
other
words
a
succession
of
good
things
said
with
and
addressed
to
the
understandings
of
those
who
hear
them
make
the
most
desirable
conversation
ladies
lovers
beaux
wits
philosophers
the
fashionable
or
the
vulgar
are
the
fittest
company
for
one
another
the
discourse
at
randal
is
the
best
for
boxers
that
at
long
for
lords
and
loungers
i
prefer
conversation
almost
to
any
other
person
because
with
a
familiar
range
of
subjects
he
colours
with
a
totally
new
and
sparkling
light
reflected
from
his
own
character
elia
the
grave
and
witty
says
things
not
to
be
surpassed
in
essence
but
the
manner
is
more
painful
and
less
a
relief
to
my
own
thoughts
some
one
conceived
he
could
not
be
an
excellent
companion
because
he
was
seen
walking
down
the
side
of
the
thames
iniquis
after
dining
at
richmond
the
objection
was
not
valid
i
will
however
admit
that
the
said
elia
is
the
worst
company
in
the
world
in
bad
company
if
it
be
granted
me
that
in
good
company
he
is
nearly
the
best
that
can
be
he
is
one
of
those
of
whom
it
may
be
said
tell
me
your
company
and
i
tell
you
your
manners
he
is
the
creature
of
sympathy
and
makes
good
whatever
opinion
you
seem
to
entertain
of
him
he
can
not
outgo
the
apprehensions
of
the
circle
and
invariably
acts
up
or
down
to
the
point
of
refinement
or
vulgarity
at
which
they
pitch
him
he
appears
to
take
a
pleasure
in
exaggerating
the
prejudice
of
strangers
against
him
a
pride
in
confirming
the
prepossessions
of
friends
in
whatever
scale
of
intellect
he
is
placed
he
is
as
lively
or
as
stupid
as
the
rest
can
be
for
their
lives
if
you
think
him
odd
and
ridiculous
he
becomes
more
and
more
so
every
minute
la
folie
till
he
is
a
wonder
gazed
at
by
all
set
him
against
a
good
wit
and
a
ready
apprehension
and
he
brightens
more
and
more
or
like
a
gate
of
steel
fronting
the
sun
receives
and
renders
back
its
figure
and
its
heat
we
had
a
pleasant
party
one
evening
at
procter
a
young
literary
bookseller
who
was
present
went
away
delighted
with
the
elegance
of
the
repast
and
spoke
in
raptures
of
a
servant
in
green
livery
and
a
patent
lamp
i
thought
myself
that
the
charm
of
the
evening
consisted
in
some
talk
about
beaumont
and
fletcher
and
the
old
poets
in
which
every
one
took
part
or
interest
and
in
a
consciousness
that
we
could
not
pay
our
host
a
better
compliment
than
in
thus
alluding
to
studies
in
which
he
excelled
and
in
praising
authors
whom
he
had
imitated
with
feeling
and
sweetness
i
should
think
it
may
also
be
laid
down
as
a
rule
on
this
subject
that
to
constitute
good
company
a
certain
proportion
of
hearers
and
speakers
is
requisite
coleridge
makes
good
company
for
this
reason
he
immediately
establishes
the
principle
of
the
division
of
labour
in
this
respect
wherever
he
comes
he
takes
his
cue
as
speaker
and
the
rest
of
the
party
theirs
as
listeners
a
herd
without
any
previous
arrangement
having
been
gone
through
i
will
just
add
that
there
can
be
no
good
society
without
perfect
freedom
from
affectation
and
constraint
if
the
unreserved
communication
of
feeling
or
opinion
leads
to
offensive
familiarity
it
is
not
well
but
it
is
no
better
where
the
absence
of
offensive
remarks
arises
only
from
formality
and
an
assumed
respectfulness
of
manner
i
do
not
think
there
is
anything
deserving
the
name
of
society
to
be
found
out
of
london
and
that
for
the
two
following
reasons
first
there
is
elsewhere
accidental
or
unavoidable
acquaintance
people
are
thrown
together
by
chance
or
grow
together
like
trees
but
you
can
pick
your
society
nowhere
but
in
london
the
very
persons
that
of
all
others
you
would
wish
to
associate
with
in
almost
every
line
of
life
or
at
least
of
intellectual
pursuit
are
to
be
met
with
there
it
is
hard
if
out
of
a
million
of
people
you
can
not
find
half
a
dozen
to
your
liking
individuals
may
seem
lost
and
hid
in
the
size
of
the
place
but
in
fact
from
this
very
circumstance
you
are
within
two
or
three
miles
reach
of
persons
that
without
it
you
would
be
some
hundreds
apart
from
secondly
london
is
the
only
place
in
which
each
individual
in
company
is
treated
according
to
his
value
in
company
and
to
that
only
in
every
other
part
of
the
kingdom
he
carries
another
character
about
with
him
which
supersedes
the
intellectual
or
social
one
it
is
known
in
manchester
or
liverpool
what
every
man
in
the
room
is
worth
in
land
or
money
what
are
his
connections
and
prospects
in
life
and
this
gives
a
character
of
servility
or
arrogance
of
mercenaries
or
impertinence
to
the
whole
of
provincial
intercourse
you
laugh
not
in
proportion
to
a
man
wit
but
his
wealth
you
have
to
consider
not
what
but
whom
you
contradict
you
speak
by
the
pound
and
are
heard
by
the
rood
in
the
metropolis
there
is
neither
time
nor
inclination
for
these
remote
calculations
every
man
depends
on
the
quantity
of
sense
wit
or
good
manners
he
brings
into
society
for
the
reception
he
meets
with
in
it
a
member
of
parliament
soon
finds
his
level
as
a
commoner
the
merchant
and
manufacturer
can
not
bring
his
goods
to
market
here
the
great
landed
proprietor
shrinks
from
being
the
lord
of
acres
into
a
pleasant
companion
or
a
dull
fellow
when
a
visitor
enters
or
leaves
a
room
it
is
not
inquired
whether
he
is
rich
or
poor
whether
he
lives
in
a
garret
or
a
palace
or
comes
in
his
own
or
a
hackney
coach
but
whether
he
has
a
good
expression
of
countenance
with
an
unaffected
manner
and
whether
he
is
a
man
of
understanding
or
a
blockhead
these
are
the
circumstances
by
which
you
make
a
favourable
impression
on
the
company
and
by
which
they
estimate
you
in
the
abstract
in
the
country
they
consider
whether
you
have
a
vote
at
the
next
election
or
a
place
in
your
gift
and
measure
the
capacity
of
others
to
instruct
or
entertain
them
by
the
strength
of
their
pockets
and
their
credit
with
their
banker
personal
merit
is
at
a
prodigious
discount
in
the
provinces
i
like
the
country
very
well
if
i
want
to
enjoy
my
own
company
but
london
is
the
only
place
for
equal
society
or
where
a
man
can
say
a
good
thing
or
express
an
honest
opinion
without
subjecting
himself
to
being
insulted
unless
he
first
lays
his
purse
on
the
table
to
back
his
pretensions
to
talent
or
independence
of
spirit
i
speak
from
experience
notes
to
essay
iv
it
is
not
very
long
ago
that
i
saw
two
dissenting
ministers
the
of
the
sanguine
visionary
temperament
in
politics
stuffing
their
pipes
with
dried
calling
it
radical
tobacco
lighting
it
with
a
lens
in
the
rays
of
the
sun
and
at
every
puff
fancying
that
they
undermined
the
boroughmongers
as
trim
blew
up
the
army
opposed
to
the
allies
they
had
the
methinks
i
see
them
now
smiling
as
in
scorn
of
corruption
dream
on
blest
pair
yet
happier
if
you
knew
your
happiness
and
knew
to
know
no
more
the
world
of
reform
that
you
dote
on
like
berkeley
material
world
lives
only
in
your
own
brain
and
long
may
it
live
there
those
same
dissenting
ministers
throughout
the
country
i
mean
the
descendants
of
the
old
puritans
are
to
this
hour
a
sort
of
men
very
turbulent
fellows
in
my
opinion
altogether
incorrigible
and
according
to
the
suggestions
of
others
should
be
hanged
out
of
the
way
without
judge
or
jury
for
the
safety
of
church
and
state
marry
hang
them
they
may
be
left
to
die
a
natural
death
the
race
is
nearly
extinct
of
itself
and
can
do
little
more
good
or
harm

in

his
account

his
occult
sagacity
of
his
eyes
prominent
and
wild
like
a
hare
fugacious
of
followers
of
the
arts
by
which
he
had
left
the
city
to
lure
the
patients
that
he
wanted
after
him
to
the
west
end
of
the
ounce
of
tea
that
he
purchased
by
stratagem
as
an
unusual
treat
to
his
guest
and
of
the
narrow
winding
staircase
from
the
height
of
which
he
contemplated
in
security
the
imaginary
approach
of

he
was

large
plain

preacher
turned
physician
he
was
an
honest
man
but
vain
of
he
knew
not
what
he
was
once
sitting
where
sarratt
was
playing
a
game
at
chess
without
seeing
the
board
and
after
remaining
for
some
time
absorbed
in
silent
wonder
he
turned
suddenly
to
me
and
said
you
know
hazlitt
that
i
think
there
is
something
i
could
do
what
is
that
perhaps
you
would
not
guess
but
i
think
i
could
dance
sure
i
could
ay
i
could
dance
like
vestris
sarratt
who
was
a
man
of
various
accomplishments
among
others
one
of
the
fancy
afterwards
bared
his
arm
to
convince
us
of
his
muscular
strength
and
sarratt
going
out
of
the
room
with
another
lady
said
you
know
madam
the
doctor
is
a
great
jumper

could
not
outdo
this
never
shall
i

pulling
off

equal
terms
with
martin
burney
life
is
short
but
full
of
mirth
and
pastime
did
we
not
so
soon
forget
what
we
have
laughed
at
perhaps
that
we
may
not
remember
what
we
have
cried
at
sarratt
the
was
an
extraordinary
man
he
had
the
same
tenacious
epileptic
faculty
in
other
things
that
he
had
at
chess
and
could
no
more
get
any
other
ideas
out
of
his
mind
than
he
could
those
of
the
figures
on
the
board
he
was
a
great
reader
but
had
not
the
least
taste
indeed
the
violence
of
his
memory
tyrannised
over
and
destroyed
all
power
of
selection
he
could
repeat
all
ossian
by
heart
without
knowing
the
best
passage
from
the
worst
and
did
not
perceive
he
was
tiring
you
to
death
by
giving
an
account
of
the
breed
education
and
manners
of
for
hours
together
the
sense
of
reality
quite
superseded
the
distinction
between
the
pleasurable
and
the
painful
he
was
altogether
a
mechanical

turns
you
could
not
help
feeling
that
some
of
their
great
men
were
authors
among
merchants
and
merchants
among
authors
their
bread
was
buttered
on
both
sides
and
they
had
you
at
a
disadvantage
either
way
the
manchester
on
the
contrary
set
up
no
pretensions
beyond
their
looms
were
hearty
good
fellows
and
took
any
information
or
display
of
ingenuity
on
other
subjects
in
good
part
i
remember
well
being
introduced
to
a
distinguished
patron
of
art
and
rising
merit
at
a
little
distance
from
liverpool
and
was
received
with
every
mark
of
attention
and
politeness
till
the
conversation
turning
on
italian
literature
our
host
remarked
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
english
language
corresponding
to
the
severity
of
the
italian
ode
except
perhaps
dryden
and
pope
cecilia
i
could
no
longer
contain
my
desire
to
display
my
smattering
in
criticism
and
began
to
maintain
that
pope
ode
was
as
it
appeared
to
me
far
from
an
example
of
severity
in
writing
i
soon
perceived
what
i
had
done
but
here
am
i
writing
in
consequence
alas
i
knew
as
little
of
the
world
then
as
i
do
now
i
never
could
understand
anything
beyond
an
abstract
definition
essay
on
the
aristocracy
of
letters
ha
here
three
of
us
are
sophisticated
off
you
lendings
there
is
such
a
thing
as
an
aristocracy
or
privileged
order
in
letters
which
has
sometimes
excited
my
wonder
and
sometimes
my
spleen
we
meet
with
authors
who
have
never
done
anything
but
who
have
a
vast
reputation
for
what
they
could
have
done
their
names
stand
high
and
are
in
everybody
mouth
but
their
works
are
never
heard
of
or
had
better
remain
undiscovered
for
the
sake
of
their
nominis
their
pretensions
are
lofty
and
unlimited
as
they
have
nothing
to
rest
upon
or
because
it
is
impossible
to
confront
them
with
the
proofs
of
their
deficiency
if
you
inquire
farther
and
insist
upon
some
act
of
authorship
to
establish
the
claims
of
these
epicurean
votaries
of
the
muses
you
find
that
they
had
a
great
reputation
at
cambridge
that
they
were
senior
wranglers
or
successful
that
they
visit
at
holland
house
and
to
support
that
honour
must
be
supposed
of
course
to
occupy
the
first
rank
in
the
world
of
letters
it
is
possible
however
that
they
have
some
manuscript
work
in
hand
which
is
of
too
much
importance
and
the
writer
has
too
much
at
stake
in
publishing
it
hastily
to
see
the
light
or
perhaps
they
once
had
an
article
in
the
edinburgh
review
which
was
much
admired
at
the
time
and
is
kept
by
them
ever
since
as
a
kind
of
diploma
and
unquestionable
testimonial
of
merit
they
are
not
like
grub
street
authors
who
write
for
bread
and
are
paid
by
the
sheet
like
misers
who
hoard
their
wealth
they
are
supposed
to
be
masters
of
all
the
wit
and
sense
they
do
not
impart
to
the
public
have
most
of
what
they
contain
says
a
considerable
philosopher
and
these
persons
it
must
be
confessed
have
a
prodigious
command
over
themselves
in
the
expenditure
of
light
and
learning
the
oriental
curse
that
mine
enemy
had
written
a
book
hangs
suspended
over
them
by
never
committing
themselves
they
neither
give
a
handle
to
the
malice
of
the
world
nor
excite
the
jealousy
of
friends
and
keep
all
the
reputation
they
have
got
not
by
discreetly
blotting
but
by
never
writing
a
line
some
one
told
sheridan
who
was
always
busy
about
some
new
work
and
never
advancing
any
farther
in
it
that
he
would
not
write
because
he
was
afraid
of
the
author
of
the
for
so
these
idle
pretenders
are
afraid
of
undergoing
a
comparison
with
themselves
in
something
they
have
never
done
but
have
had
credit
for
doing
they
do
not
acquire
celebrity
they
assume
it
and
escape
detection
by
never
venturing
out
of
their
imposing
and
mysterious
incognito
they
do
not
let
themselves
down
by
everyday
work
for
them
to
appear
in
print
is
a
work
of
supererogation
as
much
as
in
lords
and
kings
and
like
gentlemen
with
a
large
landed
estate
they
live
on
their
established
character
and
do
nothing
or
as
little
as
possible
to
increase
or
lose
it
there
is
not
a
more
deliberate
piece
of
grave
imposture
going
i
know
a
person
of
this
description
who
has
been
employed
many
years
by
implication
in
a
translation
of
thucydides
of
which
no
one
ever
saw
a
word
but
it
does
not
answer
the
purpose
of
bolstering
up
a
factitious
reputation
the
less
on
that
account
the
longer
it
is
delayed
and
kept
sacred
from
the
vulgar
gaze
the
more
it
swells
into
imaginary
consequence
the
labour
and
care
required
for
a
work
of
this
kind
being
immense
and
then
there
are
no
faults
in
an
unexecuted
translation
the
only
impeccable
writers
are
those
that
never
wrote
another
is
an
oracle
on
subjects
of
taste
and
classical
erudition
because
he
says
at
least
he
reads
cicero
once
a
year
to
keep
up
the
purity
of
his
latinity
a
third
makes
the
indecency
pass
for
the
depth
of
his
researches
and
for
a
high
gusto
in
till
from
his
seeing
nothing
in
the
finest
remains
of
ancient
art
the
world
by
the
merest
accident
find
out
that
there
is
nothing
in
him
there
is
scarcely
anything
that
a
grave
face
with
an
impenetrable
manner
will
not
accomplish
and
whoever
is
weak
enough
to
impose
upon
himself
will
have
wit
enough
to
impose
upon
the
public
particularly
if
he
can
make
it
their
interest
to
be
deceived
by
shallow
boasting
and
contrives
not
to
hurt
their
by
sterling
acquirements
do
you
suppose
that
the
understood
translation
of
thucydides
costs
its
supposed
author
nothing
a
select
party
of
friends
and
admirers
dine
with
him
once
a
week
at
a
magnificent
town
mansion
or
a
more
elegant
and
picturesque
retreat
in
the
country
they
broach
their
horace
and
their
old
hock
and
sometimes
allude
with
a
considerable
degree
of
candour
to
the
defects
of
works
which
are
brought
out
by
contemporary
writers
the
ephemeral
offspring
of
haste
and
necessity
among
other
things
the
learned
languages
are
a
ready
passport
to
this
sort
of
unmeaning
unanalysed
reputation
they
presently
lift
a
man
up
among
the
celestial
constellations
the
signs
of
the
zodiac
as
it
were
and
third
heaven
of
inspiration
from
whence
he
looks
down
on
those
who
are
toiling
on
in
this
lower
sphere
and
earning
their
bread
by
the
sweat
of
their
brain
at
leisure
and
in
scorn
if
the
graduates
in
this
way
condescend
to
express
their
thoughts
in
english
it
is
understood
to
be
such
light
and
unaccustomed
essays
do
not
fit
the
ponderous
gravity
of
their
pen
they
only
draw
to
advantage
and
with
full
justice
to
themselves
in
the
bow
of
the
ancients
their
native
tongue
is
to
them
strange
inelegant
unapt
and
crude
they
can
not
command
it
to
any
utterance
of
harmony
they
have
not
the
skill
this
is
true
enough
but
you
must
not
say
so
under
a
heavy
penalty
the
displeasure
of
pedants
and
blockheads
it
would
be
sacrilege
against
the
privileged
classes
the
aristocracy
of
letters
what
will
you
affirm
that
a
profound
latin
scholar
a
perfect
grecian
can
not
write
a
page
of
common
sense
or
grammar
is
it
not
to
be
presumed
by
all
the
charters
of
the
universities
and
the
foundations
of
that
he
who
can
speak
a
dead
language
must
be
conversant
with
his
own
surely
the
greater
implies
the
less
he
who
knows
every
science
and
every
art
can
not
be
ignorant
of
the
most
familiar
forms
of
speech
or
if
this
plea
is
found
not
to
hold
water
then
our
scholastic
bungler
is
said
to
be
above
this
vulgar
trial
of
skill
must
be
excused
to
want
of
practice
but
did
you
not
observe
the
elegance
of
the
latinity
how
well
that
period
would
become
a
classical
and
studied
dress
thus
defects
are
into
excellences
and
they
screen
their
idol
and
require
you
at
your
peril
to
pay
prescriptive
homage
to
false
concords
and
inconsequential
criticisms
because
the
writer
of
them
has
the
character
of
the
first
or
second
greek
or
latin
scholar
in
the
kingdom
if
you
do
not
swear
to
the
truth
of
these
spurious
credentials
you
are
ignorant
and
malicious
a
quack
and
a
scribbler
delicto
thus
the
man
who
can
merely
read
and
construe
some
old
author
is
of
a
class
superior
to
any
living
one
and
by
parity
of
reasoning
to
those
old
authors
themselves
the
poet
or
of
true
and
original
genius
by
the
courtesy
of
custom
to
the
learned
fool
or
as
the
author
of
has
so
well
stated
the
same
thing
he
that
is
but
able
to
express
no
sense
at
all
in
several
languages
will
pass
for
learneder
than
he
that
known
to
speak
the
strongest
reason
in
his
own
these
preposterous
and
unfounded
claims
of
mere
scholars
to
precedence
in
the
commonwealth
of
letters
which
they
set
up
so
formally
themselves
and
which
others
so
readily
bow
to
are
partly
owing
to
traditional
prejudice
there
was
a
time
when
learning
was
the
only
distinction
from
ignorance
and
when
there
was
no
such
thing
as
popular
english
literature
again
there
is
something
more
palpable
and
positive
in
this
kind
of
acquired
knowledge
like
acquired
wealth
which
the
vulgar
easily
recognise
that
others
know
the
meaning
of
signs
which
they
are
confessedly
and
altogether
ignorant
of
is
to
them
both
a
matter
of
fact
and
a
subject
of
endless
wonder
the
languages
are
worn
like
a
dress
by
a
man
and
distinguish
him
sooner
than
his
natural
figure
and
we
are
from
motives
of
inclined
to
give
others
credit
for
the
ideas
they
have
borrowed
or
have
come
into
indirect
possession
of
rather
than
for
those
that
originally
belong
to
them
and
are
exclusively
their
own
the
merit
in
them
and
the
implied
inferiority
in
ourselves
is
less
learning
is
a
kind
of
external
appendage
or
transferable
property
mine
is
his
and
may
be
any
man
genius
and
understanding
are
a
man
self
an
integrant
part
of
his
personal
identity
and
the
title
to
these
last
as
it
is
the
most
difficult
to
be
ascertained
is
also
the
most
grudgingly
acknowledged
few
persons
would
pretend
to
deny
that
porson
had
more
greek
than
they
it
was
a
question
of
fact
which
might
be
put
to
the
immediate
proof
and
could
not
be
gainsaid
but
the
meanest
frequenter
of
the
cider
cellar
or
the
hole
in
the
wall
would
be
inclined
in
his
own
conceit
to
dispute
the
palm
of
wit
or
sense
with
him
and
indemnify
his
for
the
admiration
paid
to
living
learning
by
significant
hints
to
friends
and
casual
that
the
greatest
men
when
you
came
to
know
them
were
not
without
their
weak
sides
as
well
as
others
pedants
i
will
add
here
talk
to
the
vulgar
as
pedagogues
talk
to
schoolboys
on
an
understood
principle
of
condescension
and
superiority
and
therefore
make
little
progress
in
the
knowledge
of
men
or
things
while
they
fancy
they
are
accommodating
themselves
to
or
else
assuming
airs
of
importance
over
inferior
capacities
these
inferior
capacities
are
really
laughing
at
them
there
can
be
no
true
superiority
but
what
arises
out
of
the
presupposed
ground
of
equality
there
can
be
no
improvement
but
from
the
free
communication
and
comparing
of
ideas
kings
and
nobles
for
this
reason
receive
little
benefit
from
society
where
all
is
submission
on
one
side
and
condescension
on
the
other
the
mind
strikes
out
truth
by
collision
as
steel
strikes
fire
from
the
flint
there
are
whole
families
who
are
born
classical
and
are
entered
in
the
heralds
college
of
reputation
by
the
right
of
consanguinity
literature
like
nobility
runs
in
the
blood
there
is
the
burney
family
there
is
no
end
of
it
or
its
pretensions
it
produces
wits
scholars
novelists
musicians
artists
in
numberless
the
name
is
alone
a
passport
to
the
temple
of
fame
those
who
bear
it
are
free
of
parnassus
by
birthright
the
founder
of
it
was
himself
an
historian
and
a
musician
but
more
of
a
courtier
and
man
of
the
world
than
either
the
secret
of
his
success
may
perhaps
be
discovered
in
the
following
passage
where
in
alluding
to
three
eminent
performers
on
different
instruments
he
says
three
illustrious
personages
were
introduced
at
the
emperor
court
etc
speaking
of
them
as
if
they
were
foreign
ambassadors
or
princes
of
the
blood
and
thus
magnifying
himself
and
his
profession
this
overshadowing
manner
carries
nearly
everything
before
it
and
mystifies
a
great
many
there
is
nothing
like
putting
the
best
face
upon
things
and
leaving
others
to
find
out
the
difference
he
who
could
call
three
musicians
would
himself
play
a
personage
through
life
and
succeed
in
his
leading
object
sir
joshua
reynolds
remarking
on
this
passage
said
one
had
a
greater
respect
than
he
had
for
his
profession
but
that
he
should
never
think
of
applying
to
it
epithets
that
were
appropriated
merely
to
external
rank
and
distinction
madame
it
must
be
owned
had
cleverness
enough
to
stock
a
whole
family
and
to
set
up
her
male
and
female
for
wits
and
virtuosos
to
the
third
and
fourth
generation
the
rest
have
done
nothing
that
i
know
of
but
keep
up
the
name
the
most
celebrated
author
in
modern
times
has
written
without
a
name
and
has
been
knighted
for
anonymous
productions
lord
byron
complains
that
horace
walpole
was
not
properly
appreciated
because
he
was
a
gentleman
and
secondly
because
he
was
a
nobleman
his
lordship
stands
in
one
at
least
of
the
predicaments
here
mentioned
and
yet
he
has
had
justice
or
somewhat
more
done
him
he
towers
above
his
fellows
by
all
the
height
of
the
peerage
if
the
poet
lends
a
grace
to
the
nobleman
the
nobleman
pays
it
back
to
the
poet
with
interest
what
a
fine
addition
is
ten
thousand
a
year
and
a
title
to
the
flaunting
pretensions
of
a
modern
rhapsodist
his
name
so
accompanied
becomes
the
mouth
well
it
is
repeated
thousands
of
times
instead
of
hundreds
because
the
reader
in
being
familiar
with
the
poet
works
seems
to
claim
acquaintance
with
the
lord
let
but
a
lord
once
own
the
happy
lines
how
the
wit
brightens
and
the
style
refines
he
smiles
at
the
praise
or
petty
cavils
of
little
men
does
he
make
a
slip
in
decorum
which
milton
declares
to
be
the
principal
thing
his
proud
crest
and
armorial
bearings
support
him
no
slurs
his
poetical
escutcheon
is
he
dull
or
does
he
put
of
some
trashy
production
on
the
public
it
is
not
charged
to
his
account
as
a
deficiency
which
he
must
make
good
at
the
peril
of
his
admirers
his
lordship
is
not
answerable
for
the
negligence
or
extravagances
of
his
muse
he
a
charmed
reputation
which
must
not
yield
like
one
of
vulgar
birth
the
noble
bard
is
for
this
reason
scarcely
vulnerable
to
the
critics
the
double
barrier
of
his
pretensions
baffles
their
puny
timid
efforts
strip
off
some
of
his
tarnished
laurels
and
the
coronet
appears
glittering
beneath
restore
them
and
it
still
shines
through
with
keener
lustre
in
fact
his
lordship
blaze
of
reputation
culminates
from
his
rank
and
place
in
society
he
sustains
two
lofty
and
imposing
characters
and
in
order
to
simplify
the
process
of
our
admiration
and
no
rubs
or
botches
in
the
way
we
equalise
his
pretensions
and
take
it
for
granted
that
he
must
be
as
superior
to
other
men
in
genius
as
he
is
in
birth
or
to
give
a
more
familiar
solution
of
the
enigma
the
poet
and
the
peer
agree
to
honour
each
other
acceptances
on
the
bank
of
fame
and
sometimes
cozen
the
town
to
some
tune
between
them
really
however
and
with
all
his
privileges
lord
byron
might
as
well
not
have
written
that
strange
letter
about
pope
i
could
not
afford
it
poor
as
i
am
why
does
he
pronounce
and
robed
that
cowper
is
no
poet
cowper
was
a
gentleman
and
of
noble
family
like
his

he
was
a
teacher
of
morality
as
well
as
a
describer
of
nature
which
is
more
than
his
lordship
is
his
will
last
as
long
as
and
his
verses
to
mary
are
not
less
touching
than
the
if
i
had
ventured
upon
such
an
assertion
as
this
it
would
have
been
worse
for
me
than
finding
out
a
borrowed
line
in

is
not
a

helpless

despised
animal

a

author
without
any
extrinsic
advantages
of
birth
breeding
or
fortune
to
set
him
off
the
real
ore
of
talents
or
learning
must
be
stamped
before
it
will
pass
current
to
be
at
all
looked
upon
as
an

a

must
be
something
more
or
less

an
author
a
rich
merchant
a
banker
a
lord
or
a

he
is
admired
for
something
foreign
to
himself
that
acts
as
a

to
the

or
a

scorched
in

now
shivering
in

now
coming
out
in

and
best

of

which
they
no

fulfil
than
they
are
thrown
aside
like
an

fashion
are
caressed
without

and
insulted
with
impunity
are

to
all
the
caprice
the
malice
and
fulsome
advances
of

their

on
mankind
at

of

for
their

instead
of
this

the

of

this

of

of
a

of

and
the

not
the

of
these

are
the
true
benefactors
of

and
ornaments
of

look
in
and
there
amidst
silver
services
and
shining
chandeliers
you
will
see
the
man
of
genius
at
his
proper
post
picking
his
teeth
and
mincing
an
opinion
sheltered
by
rank
bowing
to
wealth
a
poet
framed
glazed
and
hung
in
a
striking
light
not
a
straggling
weed
torn
and
trampled
on
not
a
poor
but
a
powdered
beau
a
sycophant
plant
an
exotic
reared
in
a
glass
case
hermetically
sealed
free
from
the
sirian
star
and
the
dread
whose
mealy
coat
no
moth
can
corrupt
nor
blight
can
wither
the
poet
keats
had
not
this
sort
of
protection
for
his
person
he
lay
bare
to
weather
the
serpent
stung
him
and
the
dropped
upon
this
little
western
flower
when
the
mercenary
servile
crew
approached
him
he
had
no
pedigree
to
show
them
no
to
hold
out
in
reversion
for
their
praise
he
was
not
in
any
great
man
train
nor
the
butt
and
puppet
of
a
lord
he
could
only
offer
them
fairest
flowers
of
the
season
carnations
and
streaked
gilliflowers
for
remembrance
and
pansies
for
thoughts
they
recked
not
of
his
gift
but
tore
him
with
hideous
shouts
and
laughter
nor
could
the
muse
protect
her
son
unless
an
author
has
all
establishment
of
his
own
or
is
entered
on
that
of
some
other
person
he
will
hardly
be
allowed
to
write
english
or
to
spell
his
own
name
to
be
well
spoken
of
he
must
enlist
under
some
standard
he
must
belong
to
some
he
must
get
the
de
on
his
side
he
must
have
literary
bail
in
readiness
thus
they
prop
up
one
another
rickety
heads
at
murray
shop
and
a
spurious
reputation
like
false
argument
runs
in
a
circle
croker
affirms
that
gifford
is
sprightly
and
gifford
that
croker
is
genteel
disraeli
that
jacob
is
wise
and
jacob
that
disraeli
is
a
member
of
parliament
must
be
answerable
that
you
are
not
dangerous
or
dull
before
you
can
be
of
the
you
must
commence
to
have
your
observations
attended
to
if
you
are
independent
unconnected
you
will
be
regarded
as
a
poor
creature
your
opinion
is
honest
you
will
say
then
ten
to
one
it
is
not
profitable
it
is
at
any
rate
your
own
so
much
the
worse
for
then
it
is
not
the
world
tom
hill
is
a
very
tolerable
barometer
in
this
respect
he
knows
nothing
hears
everything
and
repeats
just
what
he
hears
so
that
you
may
guess
pretty
well
from
this
echo
what
is
said
by
others
almost
everything
goes
by
presumption
and
appearances
you
not
think
b
language
very
elegant
i
thought
he
bowed
very
low
you
not
think
him
remarkably
he
was
unexceptionably
dressed
were
not
c
manners
quite
insinuating
he
said
nothing
you
will
at
least
allow
his
friend
to
be
a
man
talked
upon
all
subjects
alike
such
would
be
a
pretty
faithful
interpretation
of
the
tone
of
what
is
called
the
surface
is
everything
we
do
not
pierce
to
the
core
the
setting
is
more
valuable
than
the
jewel
is
it
not
so
in
other
things
as
well
as
letters
is
not
an
by
the
supposition
a
greater
man
in
his
profession
than
any
one
who
is
not
so
blazoned
compared
with
that
unrivalled
list
raphael
had
been
illegitimate
claude
not
classical
and
michael
angelo
admitted
by
special
favour
what
is
a
physician
without
a
diploma
an
alderman
without
being
knighted
an
actor
whose
name
does
not
appear
in
great
letters
all
others
are
counterfeits
men
no
mark
or
likelihood
this
was
what
made
the
jackals
of
the
north
so
eager
to
prove
that
i
had
been
turned
out
of
the
it
was
not
the
merit
of
the
articles
which
excited
their
spleen
but
their
being
there
of
the
style
they
knew
nothing
for
the
thought
they
cared
nothing
all
that
they
knew
was
that
i
wrote
in
that
powerful
journal
and
therefore
they
asserted
that
i
did
not
we
find
a
class
of
persons
who
labour
under
an
obvious
natural
inaptitude
for
whatever
they
aspire
to
their
manner
of
setting
about
it
is
a
virtual
disqualification
the
simple
affirmation
this
man
has
said
i
will
do
is
not
always
considered
as
the
proper
test
of
capacity
on
the
contrary
there
are
people
whose
bare
pretensions
are
as
good
or
better
than
the
actual
performance
of
others
what
i
myself
have
done
for
instance
i
never
find
admitted
as
proof
of
what
i
shall
be
able
to
do
whereas
i
observe
others
who
bring
as
proof
of
their
competence
to
any
task
and
are
taken
at
their
word
what
they
have
never
done
and
who
gravely
assure
those
who
are
inclined
to
trust
them
that
their
talents
are
exactly
fitted
for
some
post
because
they
are
just
the
reverse
of
what
they
have
ever
shown
them
to
be
one
man
has
the
air
of
an
editor
as
much
as
another
has
that
of
a
butler
or
porter
in
a
gentleman
family
is
the
model
of
this
character
with
a
prodigious
look
of
business
an
air
of
suspicion
which
passes
for
sagacity
and
an
air
of
deliberation
which
passes
for
judgment
if
his
own
talents
are
no
ways
prominent
it
is
inferred
he
will
be
more
impartial
and
in
earnest
in
making
use
of
those
of
others
there
is
britton
the
responsible
conductor
of
several
works
of
taste
and
erudition
yet
god
knows
without
an
idea
in
his
head
relating
to
any
one
of
them
he
is
learned
by
proxy
and
successful
from
sheer
imbecility
if
he
were
to
get
the
smallest
smattering
of
the
departments
which
are
under
his
control
he
would
betray
himself
from
his
desire
to
shine
but
as
it
is
he
leaves
others
to
do
all
the
drudgery
for
him
he
signs
his
name
in
the
or
at
the
bottom
of
a
vignette
and
nobody
suspects
any
mistake
this
contractor
for
useful
and
ornamental
literature
once
offered
me
two
guineas
for
a
and
character
of
shakespear
with
an
admission
to
his
i
went
once
there
was
a
collection
of
learned
lumber
of
antiquaries
lexicographers
and
other
obscure
and
i
had
given
up
the
day
for
lost
when
in
dropped
jack
taylor
of
the
who
would
dare
to
deny
that
he
was
sun
of
our
table
and
i
had
nothing
now
to
do
but
hear
and
laugh
taylor
knows
most
of
the
good
things
that
have
been
said
in
the
metropolis
for
the
last
thirty
years
and
is
in
particular
an
excellent
retailer
of
the
humours
and
extravagances
of
his
old
friend
peter
pindar
he
had
recounted
a
series
of
them
each
rising
above
the
other
in
a
sort
of
magnificent
burlesque
and
want
of
literal
preciseness
to
a
medley
of
laughing
and
sour
faces
when
on
his
proceeding
to
state
a
joke
of
a
practical
nature
by
the
said
peter
a
i
forget
the
name
objected
to
the
moral
of
the
story
and
to
the
whole
texture
of
taylor
facetiae
upon
which
our
host
who
had
till
now
supposed
that
all
was
going
on
swimmingly
thought
it
time
to
interfere
and
give
a
turn
to
the
conversation
by
saying
yes
gentlemen
what
we
have
hitherto
heard
fall
from
the
lips
of
our
friend
has
been
no
doubt
entertaining
and
highly
agreeable
in
its
way
but
perhaps
we
have
had
enough
of
what
is
altogether
delightful
and
pleasant
and
light
and
laughable
in
conduct
suppose
therefore
we
were
to
shift
the
subject
and
talk
of
what
is
serious
and
moral
and
industrious
and
laudable
in
character
let
us
talk
of
tomkins
the
penman
this
staggered
the
gravest
of
us
broke
up
our
and
we
went
upstairs
to
tea
so
much
for
the
didactic
vein
of
one
of
our
principal
guides
in
the
embellished
walks
of
modern
taste
and
master
manufacturers
of
letters
he
had
found
that
gravity
had
been
a
resource
when
taken
at
a
pinch
for
once
the
joke
miscarried
and
tomkins
the
penman
figures
to
this
day
nowhere
but
in
sir
joshua
picture
of
him
to
complete
the
natural
aristocracy
of
letters
we
only

a
royal
society

essay
v
lord
holland
had
made
a
diary
in
the
manner
of
boswell
of
the
conversation
held
at
his
house
and
read
it
at
the
end
of
a
week
bono
sir
james
mackintosh
made
a
considerable
figure
in
it
and
a
celebrated
poet
none
at
all
merely
answering
yes
and
no
with
this
result
he
was
by
no
means
satisfied
and
talked
incessantly
from
that
day
forward
at
the
end
of
the
week
he
asked
with
some
anxiety
and
triumph
if
his
lordship
had
continued
his
diary
expecting
himself
to
shine
in
first
row
of
the
rubric
to
which
his
noble
patron
answered
in
the
negative
with
an
intimation
that
it
had
not
appeared
to
him
worth
while
our
poet
was
thus
thrown
again
into
the
background
and
sir
james
remained
master
of
the
field
essay
vi
on
criticism
criticism
is
an
art
that
undergoes
a
great
variety
of
changes
and
aims
at
different
objects
at
different
times
at
first
it
is
generally
satisfied
to
give
an
opinion
whether
a
work
is
good
or
bad
and
to
quote
a
passage
or
two
in
support
of
this
opinion
afterwards
it
is
bound
to
assign
the
reasons
of
its
decision
and
to
analyse
supposed
beauties
or
defects
with
microscopic
minuteness
a
critic
does
nothing
nowadays
who
does
not
try
to
torture
the
most
obvious
expression
into
a
thousand
meanings
and
enter
into
a
circuitous
explanation
of
all
that
can
be
urged
for
or
against
its
being
in
the
best
or
worst
style
possible
his
object
indeed
is
not
to
do
justice
to
his
author
whom
he
treats
with
very
little
ceremony
but
to
do
himself
homage
and
to
show
his
acquaintance
with
all
the
topics
and
resources
of
criticism
if
he
recurs
to
the
stipulated
subject
in
the
end
it
is
not
till
after
he
has
exhausted
his
budget
of
general
knowledge
and
he
establishes
his
own
claims
first
in
an
elaborate
inaugural
dissertation
omni
scibile
et
quibusdam
aliis
before
he
deigns
to
bring
forward
the
pretensions
of
the
original
candidate
for
praise
who
is
only
the
second
figure
in
the
piece
we
may
sometimes
see
articles
of
this
sort
in
which
no
allusion
whatever
is
made
to
the
work
under
sentence
of
death
after
the
first
announcement
of
the
and
i
apprehend
it
would
be
a
clear
improvement
on
this
species
of
nominal
criticism
to
give
stated
periodical
accounts
of
works
that
had
never
appeared
at
all
which
would
save
the
hapless
author
the
mortification
of
writing
and
his
reviewer
the
trouble
of
reading
them
if
the
real
author
is
made
of
so
little
account
by
the
modern
critic
he
is
scarcely
more
an
object
of
regard
to
the
modern
reader
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
after
a
dozen
pages
of
subtle
metaphysical
distinction
or
solemn
didactic
declamation
in
which
the
disembodied
principles
of
all
arts
and
sciences
float
before
the
imagination
in
undefined
profusion
the
eye
turns
with
impatience
and
indifference
to
the
imperfect
embryo
specimens
of
them
and
the
hopeless
attempts
to
realise
this
splendid
jargon
in
one
poor
work
by
one
poor
author
which
is
given
up
to
summary
execution
with
as
little
justice
as
pity
when
a
actor
leaves
the
stage
men
eyes
are
idly
bent
on
him
that
enters
next
so
it
is
here
whether
this
state
of
the
press
is
not
a
serious
abuse
and
a
violent
encroachment
in
the
republic
of
letters
is
more
than
i
shall
pretend
to
determine
the
truth
is
that
in
the
quantity
of
works
that
issue
from
the
press
it
is
utterly
impossible
they
should
all
be
read
by
all
sorts
of
people
there
must
be
for
the
public
who
must
have
a
discretionary
power
vested
in
them
for
which
it
is
difficult
to
make
them
properly
accountable
authors
in
proportion
to
their
numbers
become
not
formidable
but
despicable
they
would
not
be
heard
of
or
severed
from
the
crowd
without
the
critic
aid
and
all
complaints
of
are
vain
he
considers
them
as
pensioners
on
his
bounty
for
any
pittance
or
praise
and
in
general
sets
them
up
as
butts
for
his
wit
and
spleen
or
uses
them
as
a
to
convey
his
own
favourite
notions
and
opinions
which
he
can
do
by
this
means
without
the
possibility
of
censure
or
appeal
he
looks
upon
his
literary
much
as
peter
pounce
looked
upon
parson
adams
as
a
kind
of
humble
companion
or
unnecessary
interloper
in
the
vehicle
of
fame
whom
he
has
taken
up
purely
to
oblige
him
and
whom
he
may
treat
with
neglect
or
insult
or
set
down
in
the
common
footpath
whenever
it
suits
his
humour
or
convenience
he
naturally
grows
arbitrary
with
the
exercise
of
power
he
by
degrees
wants
to
have
a
clear
stage
to
himself
and
would
be
thought
to
have
purchased
a
monopoly
of
wit
learning
and
wisdom
assumes
the
rod
affects
the
god
and
seems
to
shake
the
spheres
besides
something
of
this
overbearing
manner
goes
a
great
way
with
the
public
they
can
not
exactly
tell
whether
you
are
right
or
wrong
and
if
you
state
your
difficulties
or
pay
much
deference
to
the
sentiments
of
others
they
will
think
you
a
very
silly
fellow
or
a
mere
pretender
a
sweeping
unqualified
assertion
ends
all
controversy
and
sets
opinion
at
rest
a
sharp
sententious
cavalier
dogmatical
tone
is
therefore
necessary
even
in
to
the
office
of
a
reviewer
if
you
do
not
deliver
your
oracles
without
hesitation
how
are
the
world
to
receive
them
on
trust
and
without
inquiry
people
read
to
have
something
to
talk
about
and
seem
to
know
that
which
they
do
not
consequently
there
can
not
be
too
much
dialectics
and
debatable
matter
too
much
pomp
and
paradox
in
a
review
elevate
and
is
the
great
rule
for
producing
a
dramatic
or
critical
effect
the
more
you
startle
the
reader
the
more
he
will
be
able
to
startle
others
with
a
succession
of
smart
intellectual
shocks
the
most
admired
of
our
reviews
is
saturated
with
this
sort
of
electrical
matter
which
is
regularly
played
off
so
as
to
produce
a
good
deal
of
astonishment
and
a
strong
sensation
in
the
public
mind
the
intrinsic
merits
of
an
author
are
a
question
of
very
subordinate
consideration
to
the
keeping
up
the
character
of
the
work
and
supplying
the
town
with
a
sufficient
number
of
grave
or
brilliant
topics
for
the
consumption
of
the
next
three
months
this
decided
and
paramount
tone
in
criticism
is
the
growth
of
the
present
century
and
was
not
at
all
the
fashion
in
that
calm
peaceable
period
when
the
bore
sovereign
sway
and
masterdom
over
all
literary
productions
though
nothing
can
be
said
against
the
respectability
or
usefulness
of
that
publication
during
its
long
and
almost
exclusive
enjoyment
of
the
public
favour
yet
the
style
of
criticism
adopted
in
it
is
such
as
to
appear
slight
and
unsatisfactory
to
a
modern
reader
the
writers
instead
of
termagant
or
herod
were
somewhat
precise
and
prudish
gentle
almost
to
a
fault
full
of
candour
and
modesty
and
of
their
port
as
meek
as
is
a
maid
there
was
none
of
that
drawcansir
work
going
on
then
that
there
is
now
no
scalping
of
authors
no
hacking
and
hewing
of
their
lives
and
opinions
except
that
they
used
those
of
tristram
shandy
rather
scurvily
which
was
to
be
expected
all
however
had
a
show
of
courtesy
and
good
manners
the
satire
was
covert
and
artfully
insinuated
the
praise
was
short
and
sweet
we
meet
with
no
oracular
theories
no
profound
analysis
of
principles
no
unsparing
exposure
of
the
least
discernible
deviation
from
them
it
was
deemed
sufficient
to
recommend
the
work
in
general
terms
is
an
agreeable
volume
or
is
a
work
of
great
learning
and
research
to
set
forth
the
title
and
table
of
contents
and
proceed
without
farther
preface
to
some
appropriate
extracts
for
the
most
part
concurring
in
opinion
with
the
text
but
now
and
then
interposing
an
objection
to
maintain
appearances
and
assert
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
this
cursory
manner
of
hinting
approbation
or
dissent
would
make
but
a
lame
figure
at
present
we
must
have
not
only
an
announcement
that
is
an
agreeable
or
able
work
but
we
must
have
it
explained
at
full
length
and
so
as
to
silence
all
cavillers
in
what
the
agreeableness
or
ability
of
the
work
consists
the
author
must
be
reduced
to
a
class
all
the
living
or
defunct
examples
of
which
must
be
characteristically
and
pointedly
from
one
another
the
value
of
this
class
of
writing
must
be
developed
and
ascertained
in
comparison
with
others
the
principles
of
taste
the
elements
of
our
sensations
the
structure
of
the
human
faculties
all
must
undergo
a
strict
scrutiny
and
revision
the
modern
or
metaphysical
system
of
criticism
in
short
supposes
the
question
to
be
repeated
at
the
end
of
every
decision
and
the
answer
gives
birth
to
interminable
arguments
and
discussion
the
former
laconic
mode
was
well
adapted
to
guide
those
who
merely
wanted
to
be
informed
of
the
character
and
subject
of
a
work
in
order
to
read
it
the
present
is
more
useful
to
those
whose
object
is
less
to
read
the
work
than
to
dispute
upon
its
merits
and
go
into
company
clad
in
the
whole
defensive
and
offensive
armour
of
criticism
neither
are
we
less
removed
at
present
from
the
dry
and
meagre
mode
of
dissecting
the
skeletons
of
works
instead
of
transfusing
their
living
principles
which
prevailed
in
dryden
prefaces
and
in
the
criticisms
written
on
the
model
of
the
french
school
about
a
century
ago
a
genuine
criticism
should
as
i
take
it
reflect
the
colours
the
light
and
shade
the
soul
and
body
of
a
work
here
we
have
nothing
but
its
superficial
plan
and
elevation
as
if
a
poem
were
a
piece
of
formal
architecture
we
are
told
something
of
the
plot
or
fable
of
the
moral
and
of
the
observance
or
violation
of
the
three
unities
of
time
place
and
action
and
perhaps
a
word
or
two
is
added
on
the
dignity
of
the
persons
or
the
baldness
of
the
style
but
we
no
more
know
after
reading
one
of
these
complacent
what
the
essence
of
the
work
is
what
passion
has
been
touched
or
how
skilfully
what
tone
and
movement
the
author
mind
imparts
to
his
subject
or
receives
from
it
than
if
we
had
been
reading
a
homily
or
a
gazette
that
is
we
are
left
quite
in
the
dark
as
to
the
feelings
of
pleasure
or
pain
to
be
derived
from
the
genius
of
the
performance
or
the
manner
in
which
it
appeals
to
the
imagination
we
know
to
a
nicety
how
it
squares
with
the
threadbare
rules
of
composition
not
in
the
least
how
it
affects
the
principles
of
taste
we
know
everything
about
the
work
and
nothing
of
it
the
critic
takes
good
care
not
to
baulk
the
reader
fancy
by
anticipating
the
effect
which
the
author
has
aimed
at
producing
to
be
sure
the
works
so
handled
were
often
worthy
of
their
commentators
they
had
the
form
of
imagination
without
the
life
or
power
and
when
any
one
had
gone
regularly
through
the
number
of
acts
into
which
they
were
divided
the
measure
in
which
they
were
written
or
the
story
on
which
they
were
founded
there
was
little
else
to
be
said
about
them
it
is
curious
to
observe
the
effect
which
the
had
on
this
class
of
critics
like
throwing
a
tub
to
a
whale
they
could
make
nothing
of
it
was
out
of
all
plumb
not
one
of
the
angles
at
the
four
corners
was
a
right
angle
they
did
not
seek
for
nor
would
they
much
relish
the
marrow
of
poetry
it
contained
like
polemics
in
religion
they
had
discarded
the
essentials
of
fine
writing
for
the
outward
form
and
points
of
controversy
they
were
at
issue
with
genius
and
nature
by
what
route
and
in
what
garb
they
should
enter
the
temple
of
the
muses
accordingly
we
find
that
dryden
had
no
other
way
of
satisfying
himself
of
the
pretensions
of
milton
in
the
epic
style
but
by
translating
his
anomalous
work
into
rhyme
and
dramatic
dialogue
so
there
are
connoisseurs
who
give
you
the
subject
the
grouping
the
perspective
and
all
the
mechanical
circumstances
of
a
picture
but
they
never
say
a
word
about
the
expression
the
reason
is
they
see
the
former
but
not
the
latter
there
are
persons
however
who
can
not
employ
themselves
better
than
in
taking
an
inventory
of
works
of
art
they
want
a
faculty
for
higher
studies
as
there
are
works
of
art
so
called
which
seemed
to
have
been
composed
expressly
with
an
eye
to
such
a
class
of
connoisseurs
in
them
are
to
be
found
no
recondite
nameless
beauties
thrown
away
upon
the
stupid
vulgar
gaze
no
snatched
beyond
the
reach
of
art
nothing
but
what
the
merest
pretender
may
note
down
in
good
set
terms
in
his
book
just
as
it
is
before
him
place
one
of
these
imperfectly
organised
spectators
before
a
tall
canvas
with
groups
on
groups
of
figures
of
the
size
of
life
and
engaged
in
a
complicated
action
of
which
they
know
the
name
and
all
the
particulars
and
there
are
no
bounds
to
their
burst
of
involuntary
enthusiasm
they
mount
on
the
stilts
of
the
subject
and
ascend
the
highest
heaven
of
invention
from
whence
they
see
sights
and
hear
revelations
which
they
communicate
with
all
the
fervour
of
plenary
explanation
to
those
who
may
be
disposed
to
attend
to
their
raptures
they
float
with
wings
expanded
in
lofty
circles
they
stalk
over
the
canvas
at
large
strides
never
condescending
to
pause
at
anything
of
less
magnitude
than
a
group
or
a
colossal
figure
the
face
forms
no
part
of
their
collective
inquiries
or
so
that
it
occupies
only
a
sixth
or
an
eighth
proportion
to
the
whole
body
all
is
according
to
the
received
rules
of
composition
point
to
a
divine
portrait
of
titian
to
an
angelic
head
of
guido
close
by
they
see
and
heed
it
not
what
are
the
commercing
with
the
skies
the
soul
speaking
in
the
face
to
them
it
asks
another
and
an
inner
sense
to
comprehend
them
but
for
the
trigonometry
of
painting
nature
has
constituted
them
indifferently
well
they
take
a
stand
on
the
distinction
between
portrait
and
history
and
there
they
are
bound
tell
them
that
there
can
be
no
fine
history
without
portraiture
that
the
painter
must
proceed
from
that
ground
to
the
one
above
it
and
that
a
hundred
bad
heads
can
not
make
one
good
historical
picture
and
they
will
not
believe
you
though
the
thing
is
obvious
to
any
gross
capacity
their
ideas
always
fly
to
the
circumference
and
never
fix
at
the
centre
art
must
be
on
a
grand
scale
according
to
them
the
whole
is
greater
than
a
part
and
the
greater
necessarily
implies
the
less
the
outline
is
in
this
view
of
the
matter
the
same
thing
as
the
and
limbs
and
flourishes
of
a
discourse
the
substance
again
the
same
persons
make
an
absolute
distinction
without
knowing
why
between
high
and
low
subjects
say
that
you
would
as
soon
have
murillo
two
beggar
boys
at
the
dulwich
gallery
as
almost
any
picture
in
the
world
that
is
that
it
would
be
one
you
would
choose
out
of
ten
had
you
the
choice
and
they
reiterate
upon
you
that
surely
a
low
subject
can
not
be
of
equal
value
with
a
high
one
it
is
in
vain
that
you
turn
to
the
picture
they
keep
to
the
class
they
have
eyes
but
see
not
and
upon
their
principles
of
refined
taste
would
be
just
as
good
judges
of
the
merit
of
the
picture
without
seeing
it
as
with
that
supposed
advantage
they
know
what
the
subject
is
the
catalogue
it
is
not
true
as
lord
byron
asserts
that
execution
is
everything
and
the
class
or
subject
nothing
the
highest
subjects
equally
well
executed
which
however
rarely
happens
are
the
best
but
the
power
of
execution
the
manner
of
seeing
nature
is
one
thing
and
may
be
so
superlative
if
you
are
only
able
to
judge
of
it
as
to
countervail
every
disadvantage
of
subject
raphael
storks
in
the
miraculous
draught
of
fishes
exulting
in
the
event
are
finer
than
the
head
of
christ
would
have
been
in
almost
any
other
hands
the
cant
of
criticism
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
question
because
execution
depends
on
various
degrees
of
power
in
the
artist
and
a
knowledge
of
it
on
various
degrees
of
feeling
and
discrimination
in
you
but
to
commence
artist
or
connoisseur
in
the
grand
style
at
once
without
any
distinction
of
qualifications
whatever
it
is
only
necessary
for
the
first
to
choose
his
subject
and
for
the
last
to
pin
his
faith
on
the
sublimity
of
the
performance
for
both
to
look
down
with
ineffable
contempt
on
the
painters
and
admirers
of
subjects
of
low
life
i
remember
a
young
scotchman
once
trying
to
prove
to
me
that
dickons
was
a
superior
singer
to
miss
stephens
because
the
former
excelled
in
sacred
music
and
the
latter
did
not
at
that
rate
that
is
if
it
is
the
singing
sacred
music
that
gives
the
preference
miss
stephens
would
only
have
to
sing
sacred
music
to
surpass
herself
and
vie
with
her
pretended
rival
for
this
theory
implies
that
all
sacred
music
is
equally
good
and
therefore
better
than
any
other
i
grant
that
madame
singing
of
sacred
music
is
superior
to
miss
stephens
because
her
singing
is
better
altogether
and
an
ocean
of
sound
more
wonderful
than
a
simple
stream
of
dulcet
harmonies
in
singing
the
last
verse
of
save
the
king
not
long
ago
her
voice
towered
above
the
whole
confused
noise
of
the
orchestra
like
an
eagle
piercing
the
clouds
and
poured
sweet
thunder
through
the
ear
as
excited
equal
astonishment
and
rapture
some
kinds
of
criticism
are
as
much
too
insipid
as
others
are
too
pragmatical
it
is
not
easy
to
combine
point
with
solidity
spirit
with
moderation
and
candour
many
persons
see
nothing
but
beauties
in
a
work
others
nothing
but
defects
those
cloy
you
with
sweets
and
are
very
milk
of
human
kindness
flowing
on
in
a
stream
of
luscious
panegyrics
these
take
delight
in
poisoning
the
sources
of
your
satisfaction
and
putting
you
out
of
conceit
with
nearly
every
author
that
comes
in
their
way
the
first
are
frequently
actuated
by
personal
friendship
the
last
by
all
the
virulence
of
party
spirit
under
the
latter
head
would
fall
what
may
be
termed
the
basis
of
this
style
of
writing
is
a
of
impotent
spite
and
dulness
till
it
is
varnished
over
with
the
slime
of
servility
and
thrown
into
a
state
of
unnatural
activity
by
the
venom
of
the
most
rancorous
bigotry
the
eminent
professors
in
this
grovelling
department
are
at
first
merely
out
of
sorts
with
themselves
and
vent
their
spleen
in
little
interjections
and
contortions
of
phrase
cry
at
a
lucky
hit
and
at
a
fault
are
smart
on
personal
defects
and
sneer
at
out
of
favour
and
on
crutches
are
thrown
into
an
by
hearing
the
name
of
a
rival
start
back
with
horror
at
any
approach
to
their
morbid
pretensions
like
justice
woodcock
with
his
gouty
limbs
rifle
the
flowers
of
the
della
cruscan
school
and
give
you
in
their
stead
as
models
of
a
pleasing
pastoral
style
verses
upon
anna
which
you
may
see
in
the
notes
to
the
and
all
this
is
like
the
fable
of
kitten
and
the
leaves
but
when
they
get
their
brass
collar
on
and
shake
their
bells
of
office
they
set
up
their
backs
like
the
great
cat
rodilardus
and
pounce
upon
men
and
things
woe
to
any
little
heedess
reptile
of
an
author
that
ventures
across
their
path
without
a
from
the
board
of
control
they
snap
him
up
at
a
mouthful
and
sit
licking
their
lips
stroking
their
whiskers
and
rattling
their
bells
over
the
imaginary
fragments
of
their
devoted
prey
to
the
alarm
and
astonishment
of
the
whole
breed
of
literary
philosophical
and
revolutionary
vermin
that
were
naturalised
in
this
country
by
a
prince
of
orange
and
an
elector
of
hanover
a
hundred
years
ago
when
one
of
these
pampered
sleek
critics
makes
his
king
and
country
parties
to
this
sort
of
sport
literary
you
have
not
much
chance
of
escaping
out
of
his
clutches
in
a
whole
skin
treachery
becomes
a
principle
with
them
and
mischief
a
conscience
that
is
a
livelihood
they
not
only
the
work
in
the
lump
but
vilify
and
traduce
the
author
and
substitute
lying
abuse
and
sheer
malignity
for
sense
and
satire
to
have
written
a
popular
work
is
as
much
as
a
man
character
is
worth
and
sometimes
his
life
if
he
does
not
happen
to
be
on
the
right
side
of
the
question
the
way
in
which
they
set
about
an
adversary
is
not
to
accuse
you
of
faults
or
to
exaggerate
those
which
you
may
really
have
but
they
deny
that
you
have
any
merits
at
all
least
of
all
those
that
the
world
have
given
you
credit
for
bless
themselves
from
understanding
a
single
sentence
in
a
whole
volume
and
unless
you
are
ready
to
subscribe
to
all
their
articles
of
peace
will
not
allow
you
to
be
qualified
to
write
your
own
name
it
is
not
a
question
of
literary
discussion
but
of
political
proscription
it
is
a
mark
of
loyalty
and
patriotism
to
extend
no
quarter
to
those
of
the
opposite
party
instead
of
replying
to
your
arguments
they
call
you
names
put
words
and
opinions
into
your
mouth
which
you
have
never
uttered
and
consider
it
a
species
of
misprision
of
treason
to
admit
that
a
whig
author
knows
anything
of
common
sense
or
english
the
only
chance
of
putting
a
stop
to
this
unfair
mode
of
dealing
would
perhaps
be
to
make
a
few
reprisals
by
way
of
example
the
court
party
boast
some
writers
who
have
a
reputation
to
lose
and
who
would
not
like
to
have
their
names
dragged
through
the
kennel
of
dirty
abuse
and
vulgar
obloquy
what
silenced
the
masked
battery
of
was
the
implication
of
the
name
of
sir
walter
scott
in
some
remarks
upon
it
an
honour
of
which
it
seems
that
extraordinary
person
was
not
ambitious
to
be
on
high
stage
was
a
distinction
and
an
amusement
to
the
other
gentlemen
concerned
in
that
praiseworthy
publication
i
was
complaining
not
long
ago
of
this
prostitution
of
literary
criticism
as
peculiar
to
our
own
times
when
i
was
told
that
it
was
just
as
bad
in
the
time
of
pope
and
dryden
and
indeed
worse
inasmuch
as
we
have
no
popes
or
drydens
now
on
the
obnoxious
side
to
be
nicknamed
metamorphosed
into
scarecrows
and
impaled
alive
by
bigots
and
dunces
i
shall
not
pretend
to
say
how
far
this
remark
may
be
true
the
english
it
must
be
owned
are
rather
a
nation
besides
temporary
or
accidental
biases
of
this
kind
there
seem
to
be
sects
and
parties
in
taste
and
criticism
with
a
set
of
appropriate
watchwords
coeval
with
the
arts
of
composition
and
that
will
last
as
long
as
the
difference
with
which
men
minds
are
originally
constituted
there
are
some
who
are
all
for
the
elegance
of
an
style
and
some
who
are
equally
delighted
with
simplicity
the
last
refer
you
to
swift
as
a
model
of
english
prose
thinking
all
other
writers
sophisticated
and
naught
the
former
prefer
the
more
ornamented
and
sparkling
periods
of
junius
or
gibbon
it
is
to
no
purpose
to
think
of
bringing
about
an
understanding
between
these
opposite
factions
it
is
a
natural
difference
of
temperament
and
constitution
of
mind
the
one
will
never
relish
the
antithetical
point
and
perpetual
glitter
of
the
artificial
prose
style
as
the
plain
unperverted
english
idiom
will
always
appear
trite
and
insipid
to
the
others
a
toleration
not
an
uniformity
of
opinion
is
as
much
as
can
be
expected
in
this
case
and
both
sides
may
acknowledge
without
imputation
on
their
taste
or
consistency
that
these
different
writers
excelled
each
in
their
way
i
might
remark
here
that
the
epithet
is
very
sparingly
used
in
modern
criticism
it
has
probably
gone
out
of
fashion
with
the
appearance
of
the
school
who
i
apprehend
have
no
such
phrase
in
their
vocabulary
rogers
was
i
think
almost
the
last
poet
to
whom
it
was
applied
as
a
characteristic
compliment
at
present
it
would
be
considered
as
a
sort
of
diminutive
of
the
title
of
poet
like
the
terms
or
and
is
banished
from
the
of
letters
it
may
perhaps
come
into
request
at
some
future
period
again
the
dispute
between
the
admirers
of
homer
and
virgil
has
never
been
settled
and
never
will
for
there
will
always
be
minds
to
whom
the
excellences
of
virgil
will
be
more
congenial
and
therefore
more
objects
of
admiration
and
delight
than
those
of
homer
and
both
are
right
in
preferring
what
suits
them
best
the
delicacy
and
selectness
of
the
one
or
the
fulness
and
majestic
flow
of
the
other
there
is
the
same
difference
in
their
tastes
that
there
was
in
the
genius
of
their
two
favourites
neither
can
the
disagreement
between
the
french
and
english
school
of
tragedy
ever
be
reconciled
till
the
french
become
english
or
the
english
french
both
are
right
in
what
they
admire
both
are
wrong
in
condemning
the
others
for
what
they
admire
we
see
the
defects
of
racine
they
see
the
faults
of
shakespear
probably
in
an
exaggerated
point
of
view
but
we
may
be
sure
of
this
that
when
we
see
nothing
but
grossness
and
barbarism
or
insipidity
and
verbiage
in
a
writer
that
is
the
god
of
a
nation
idolatry
it
is
we
and
not
they
who
want
true
taste
and
feeling
the
controversy
about
pope
and
the
opposite
school
in
our
own
poetry
comes
to
much
the
same
thing
correctness
smoothness
are
very
good
things
and
much
to
be
commended
in
him
but
it
is
not
to
be
expected
or
even
desired
that
others
should
have
these
qualities
in
the
same
paramount
degree
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else
if
you
like
correctness
and
smoothness
of
all
things
in
the
world
there
they
are
for
you
in
pope
if
you
like
other
things
better
such
as
strength
and
sublimity
you
know
where
to
go
for
them
why
trouble
pope
or
any
other
author
for
what
they
have
not
and
do
not
profess
to
give
those
who
seem
to
imply
that
pope
possessed
besides
his
own
peculiar
exquisite
merits
all
that
is
to
be
found
in
shakespear
or
milton
are
i
should
hardly
think
in
good
earnest
but
i
do
not
therefore
see
that
because
this
was
not
the
case
pope
was
no
poet
we
can
not
by
a
little
verbal
sophistry
confound
the
qualities
of
different
minds
nor
force
opposite
excellences
into
a
union
by
all
the
intolerance
in
the
world
we
may
pull
pope
in
pieces
as
long
as
we
please
for
not
being
shakespear
or
milton
as
we
may
carp
at
them
for
not
being
pope
but
this
will
not
make
a
poet
equal
to
all
three
if
we
have
a
taste
for
some
one
precise
style
or
manner
we
may
keep
it
to
ourselves
and
let
others
have
theirs
if
we
are
more
catho
and
beauty
it
is
spread
abroad
for
us
to
profusion
in
the
variety
of
books
and
in
the
several
growth
of
men
minds
fettered
by
no
capricious
or
arbitrary
rules
those
who
would
proscribe
whatever
falls
short
of
a
given
standard
of
imaginary
perfection
do
so
not
from
a
higher
capacity
of
taste
or
range
of
intellect
than
others
but
to
destroy
to
and
cabin
in
all
enjoyments
and
opinions
but
their
own
we
find
people
of
a
decided
and
original
and
others
of
a
more
general
and
versatile
taste
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
the
most
acute
and
men
made
bad
critics
they
see
everything
too
much
through
a
particular
medium
what
does
not
fall
in
with
their
own
bias
and
mode
of
composition
strikes
them
as
and
factitious
what
does
not
come
into
the
direct
line
of
their
vision
they
regard
idly
with
vacant
eye
the
extreme
force
of
their
original
impressions
compared
with
the
feebleness
of
those
they
receive
at
from
others
oversets
the
balance
and
just
proportion
of
their
minds
men
who
have
fewer
native
resources
and
are
obliged
to
apply
oftener
to
the
general
stock
acquire
by
habit
a
greater
aptitude
in
appreciating
what
they
owe
to
others
their
taste
is
not
made
a
sacrifice
to
their
egotism
and
vanity
and
they
enrich
the
soil
of
their
minds
with
continual
accessions
of
borrowed
strength
and
beauty
i
might
take
this
opportunity
of
observing
that
the
person
of
the
most
refined
and
least
contracted
taste
i
ever
knew
was
the
late
joseph
fawcett
the
friend
of
my
youth
he
was
almost
the
first
literary
acquaintance
i
ever
made
and
i
think
the
most
candid
and
unsophisticated
he
had
a
masterly
perception
of
all
styles
and
of
every
kind
and
degree
of
excellence
sublime
or
beautiful
from
milton
to
ballad
from
butler
down
to
if
you
had
a
favourite
author
he
had
read
him
too
and
knew
all
the
best
morsels
the
subtle
traits
the
capital
touches
you
like
sterne
to
be
sure
he
would
say
should
deserve
to
be
hanged
if
i
did
his
repeating
some
parts
of
with
his
fine
deep
voice
particularly
the
lines
have
heard
my
mother
circe
with
the
sirens
three
and
the
enthusiastic
comments
he
made
afterwards
were
a
feast
to
the
ear
and
to
the
soul
he
read
the
poetry
of
milton
with
the
same
fervour
and
spirit
of
devotion
that
i
have
since
heard
others
read
their
own
is
the
most
delicious
feeling
of
all
i
have
heard
him
explain
like
what
is
excellent
no
matter
whose
it
is
in
this
respect
he
practised
what
he
preached
he
was
incapable
of
harbouring
a
sinister
motive
and
judged
only
from
what
he
felt
there
was
no
flaw
or
mist
in
the
clear
mirror
of
his
mind
he
was
as
open
to
impressions
as
he
was
strenuous
in
maintaining
them
he
did
not
care
a
rush
whether
a
writer
was
old
or
new
in
prose
or
in
verse
he
wanted
he
said
something
to
make
him
think
most
men
minds
are
to
me
like
musical
instruments
out
of
tune
touch
a
particular
key
and
it
jars
and
makes
harsh
discord
with
your
own
they
like
blas
but
can
see
nothing
to
laugh
at
in
quixote
they
adore
richardson
but
are
disgusted
with
fielding
fawcett
had
a
taste
accommodated
to
all
these
he
was
not
exceptious
he
gave
a
cordial
welcome
to
all
sort
provided
they
were
the
best
in
their
kind
he
was
not
fond
of
counterfeits
or
duplicates
his
own
style
was
laboured
and
artificial
to
a
fault
while
his
character
was
frank
and
ingenuous
in
the
extreme
he
was
not
the
only
individual
whom
i
have
known
to
counteract
their
natural
disposition
in
coming
before
the
public
and
by
avoiding
what
they
perhaps
thought
an
inherent
infirmity
debar
themselves
of
their
real
strength
and
advantages
a
heartier
friend
or
honester
critic
i
never
coped
withal
he
has
made
me
feel
by
contrast
the
want
of
genuine
sincerity
and
generous
sentiment
in
some
that
i
have
listened
to
since
and
convinced
me
if
practical
proof
were
wanting
of
the
truth
of
that
text
of
scripture
had
i
all
knowledge
and
could
speak
with
the
tongues
of
angels
yet
without
charity
i
were
nothing
i
would
rather
be
a
man
of
disinterested
taste
and
liberal
feeling
to
see
and
acknowledge
truth
and
beauty
wherever
i
found
it
than
a
man
of
greater
and
more
original
genius
to
hate
envy
and
deny
all
excellence
but
my
own
but
that
poor
scanty
pittance
of
it
compared
with
the
whole
which
i
had
myself
produced
there
is
another
race
of
critics
who
might
be
designated
as
the
they
discern
no
beauties
but
what
are
concealed
from
superficial
eyes
and
overlook
all
that
are
obvious
to
the
vulgar
part
of
mankind
their
art
is
the
transmutation
of
styles
by
happy
alchemy
of
mind
they
convert
dross
into
gold
and
gold
into
tinsel
they
see
farther
into
a
millstone
than
most
others
if
an
author
is
utterly
unreadable
they
can
read
him
for
ever
his
intricacies
are
their
delight
his
mysteries
are
their
study
they
prefer
sir
thomas
browne
to
the
by
johnson
and
burton
of
to
all
the
writers
of
the
georgian
age
they
judge
of
works
of
genius
as
misers
do
of
hid
treasure
it
is
of
no
value
unless
they
have
it
all
to
themselves
they
will
no
more
share
a
book
than
a
mistress
with
a
friend
if
they
suspected
their
favourite
volumes
of
delighting
any
eyes
but
their
own
they
would
immediately
discard
them
from
the
list
theirs
are
superannuated
beauties
that
every
one
else
has
left
off
intriguing
with
bedridden
hags
a
of
nightmares
this
is
not
envy
or
affectation
but
a
natural
proneness
to
singularity
a
love
of
what
is
odd
and
out
of
the
way
they
must
come
at
their
pleasures
with
difficulty
and
support
admiration
by
an
uneasy
sense
of
ridicule
and
opposition
they
despise
those
qualities
in
a
work
which
are
cheap
and
obvious
they
like
a
monopoly
of
taste
and
are
shocked
at
the
prostitution
of
intellect
implied
in
popular
productions
in
like
manner
they
would
choose
a
friend
or
recommend
a
mistress
for
gross
defects
and
tolerate
the
sweetness
of
an
actress
voice
only
for
the
ugliness
of
her
face
pure
pleasures
are
in
their
judgment
cloying
and
insipid
an
ounce
of
sour
is
worth
a
pound
of
sweet
nothing
goes
down
with
them
but
what
is
to
the
multitude
they
are
eaters
of
olives
and
readers
of
yet
they
smack
of
genius
and
would
be
worth
any
money
were
it
only
for
the
rarity
of
the
thing
the
last
sort
i
shall
mention
are
mere
fellows
that
pick
out
a
word
in
a
sentence
and
a
sentence
in
a
volume
and
tell
you
it
is
wrong
these
erudite
persons
constantly
find
out
by
anticipation
that
you
are
deficient
in
the
smallest
things
that
you
can
not
spell
certain
words
or
join
the
nominative
case
and
the
verb
together
because
to
do
this
is
the
height
of
their
own
ambition
and
of
course
they
must
set
you
down
lower
than
their
opinion
of
themselves
they
degrade
by
reducing
you
to
their
own
standard
of
merit
for
the
qualifications
they
deny
you
or
the
faults
they
object
are
so
very
insignificant
that
to
prove
yourself
possessed
of
the
one
or
free
from
the
other
is
to
make
yourself
doubly
ridiculous
littleness
is
their
element
and
they
give
a
character
of
meanness
to
whatever
they
touch
they
creep
buzz
and
it
is
much
easier
to
crush
than
to
catch
these
troublesome
insects
and
when
they
are
in
your
power
your
spares
them
the
race
is
almost
extinct
one
or
two
of
them
are
sometimes
seen
crawling
over
the
pages
of
the
review
notes
to
essay
vi
a
rose
and
the
rev
kippis
were
for
many
years
its
principal
support
rose
i
have
heard
my
father
say
contributed
the
monthly
catalogue
there
is
sometimes
a
certain
tartness
and
the
woman
tongue
in
it
it
is
said
of
gray
little
poem
however
humble
its
pretensions
is
not
without
elegance
or
merit
the
characters
of
prophet
and
critic
are
not
always
united
there
are
some
splendid
exceptions
to
this
censure
his
comparison
between
ovid
and
virgil
and
his
character
of
shakespear
are
masterpieces
of
their
kind
we
have
critics
in
the
present
day
who
can
not
tell
what
to
make
of
the
tragic
writers
of
queen
elizabeth
age
except
shakespear
who
passes
by
prescriptive
right
and
are
extremely
puzzled
to
reduce
the
efforts
of
their
and
irregular
power
to
the
standard
of
their
own
slight
and
showy
the
truth
is
they
had
better
give
up
the
attempt
to
reconcile
such
contradictions
as
an
artificial
taste
and
natural
genius
and
repose
on
the
admiration
of
verses
which
derive
their
odour
from
the
scent
of
rose
leaves
inserted
between
the
pages
and
their
polish
from
the
smoothness
of
the
paper
on
which
they
are
printed
they
and
such
writers
as
decker
and
webster
beaumont
and
fletcher
ford
and
marlowe
move
in
different
orbits
of
the
human
intellect
and
need
never
jostle
the
intelligent
reader
will
be
pleased
to
understand
that
there
is
here
a
tacit
allusion
to
squire
western
significant
phrase
of
of
the
two
the
latter
alternative
is
more
likely
to
happen
we

not
imitate

the

essay
vii
on
great
and
little
things
these
little
things
are
great
to
little
man
goldsmith
the
great
and
the
little
have
no
doubt
a
real
existence
in
the
nature
of
things
but
they
both
find
pretty
much
the
same
level
in
the
mind
of
man
it
is
a
common
measure
which
does
not
always
accommodate
itself
to
the
size
and
importance
of
the
objects
it
represents
it
has
a
certain
interest
to
spare
for
certain
things
and
no
more
according
to
its
humour
and
capacity
and
neither
likes
to
be
stinted
in
its
allowance
nor
to
muster
up
an
unusual
share
of
sympathy
just
as
the
occasion
may
require
perhaps
if
we
could
recollect
distinctly
we
should
discover
that
the
two
things
that
have
affected
us
most
in
the
course
of
our
lives
have
been
one
of
them
of
the
greatest
and
the
other
of
the
smallest
possible
consequence
to
let
that
pass
as
too
fine
a
speculation
we
know
well
enough
that
very
trifling
circumstances
do
give
us
great
and
daily
annoyance
and
as
often
prove
too
much
for
our
philosophy
and
forbearance
as
matters
of
the
highest
moment
a
lump
of
soot
spoiling
a
man
dinner
a
plate
of
toast
falling
in
the
ashes
the
being
disappointed
of
a
ribbon
to
a
cap
or
a
ticket
for
a
ball
have
led
to
serious
and
almost
tragical
consequences
friends
not
unfrequently
fall
out
and
never
meet
again
for
some
idle
misunderstanding
trick
not
worth
an
egg
who
have
stood
the
shock
of
serious
differences
of
opinion
and
clashing
interests
in
life
and
there
is
an
excellent
paper
in
the
to
prove
that
if
a
married
couple
do
not
quarrel
about
some
point
in
the
first
instance
not
worth
contesting
they
will
seldom
find
an
opportunity
afterwards
to
quarrel
about
a
question
of
real
importance
grave
divines
great
statesmen
and
deep
philosophers
are
put
out
of
their
way
by
very
little
things
nay
discreet
worthy
people
without
any
pretensions
but
to
and
common
sense
readily
surrender
the
happiness
of
their
whole
lives
sooner
than
give
up
an
opinion
to
which
they
have
committed
themselves
though
in
all
likelihood
it
was
the
mere
turn
of
a
feather
which
side
they
should
take
in
the
argument
it
is
the
being
baulked
or
thwarted
in
anything
that
constitutes
the
grievance
the
unpardonable
affront
not
the
value
of
the
thing
to
which
we
had
made
up
our
minds
is
it
that
we
despise
little
things
that
we
are
not
prepared
for
them
that
they
take
us
in
our
careless
unguarded
moments
and
tease
us
out
of
our
ordinary
patience
by
their
petty
incessant
insect
warfare
buzzing
about
us
and
stinging
us
like
gnats
so
that
we
can
neither
get
rid
of
nor
grapple
with
them
whereas
we
collect
all
our
fortitude
and
resolution
to
meet
evils
of
greater
magnitude
or
is
it
that
there
is
a
certain
stream
of
irritability
that
is
continually
fretting
upon
the
wheels
of
life
which
finds
sufficient
food
to
play
with
in
straws
and
feathers
while
great
objects
are
too
much
for
it
either
choke
it
up
or
divert
its
course
into
serious
and
thoughtful
interest
some
attempt
might
be
made
to
explain
this
in
the
following
manner
one
is
always
more
vexed
at
losing
a
game
of
any
sort
by
a
single
hole
or
ace
than
if
one
has
never
had
a
chance
of
winning
it
this
is
no
doubt
in
part
or
chiefly
because
the
prospect
of
success
irritates
the
subsequent
disappointment
but
people
have
been
known
to
pine
and
fall
sick
from
holding
the
next
number
to
the
twenty
thousand
pound
prize
in
the
lottery
now
this
could
only
arise
from
their
being
so
near
winning
in
fancy
from
there
seeming
to
be
so
thin
a
partition
between
them
and
success
when
they
were
within
one
of
the
right
number
why
could
they
not
have
taken
the
next
it
was
so
easy
this
haunts
their
minds
and
will
not
let
them
rest
notwithstanding
the
absurdity
of
the
reasoning
it
is
that
the
will
here
has
a
slight
imaginary
obstacle
to
surmount
to
attain
its
end
it
should
appear
it
had
only
an
exceedingly
trifling
effort
to
make
for
this
purpose
that
it
was
absolutely
in
its
power
had
it
known
to
seize
the
envied
prize
and
it
is
continually
harassing
itself
by
making
the
obvious
transition
from
one
number
to
the
other
when
it
is
too
late
that
is
to
say
the
will
acts
in
proportion
to
its
fancied
power
to
its
superiority
over
immediate
obstacles
now
in
little
or
indifferent
matters
there
seems
no
reason
why
it
should
not
have
its
own
way
and
therefore
a
disappointment
vexes
it
the
more
it
grows
angry
according
to
the
insignificance
of
the
occasion
and
frets
itself
to
death
about
an
object
merely
because
from
its
very
futility
there
can
be
supposed
to
be
no
real
difficulty
in
the
way
of
its
attainment
nor
anything
more
required
for
this
purpose
than
a
determination
of
the
will
the
being
baulked
of
this
throws
the
mind
off
its
balance
or
puts
it
into
what
is
called
passion
and
as
nothing
but
an
act
of
voluntary
power
still
seems
necessary
to
get
rid
of
every
impediment
we
indulge
our
violence
more
and
more
and
heighten
our
impatience
by
degrees
into
a
sort
of
frenzy
the
object
is
the
same
as
it
was
but
we
are
no
longer
as
we
were
the
blood
is
heated
the
muscles
are
strained
the
feelings
are
wound
up
to
a
pitch
of
agony
with
the
vain
strife
the
temper
is
tried
to
the
utmost
it
will
bear
the
more
contemptible
the
object
or
the
obstructions
in
the
way
to
it
the
more
are
we
provoked
at
being
hindered
by
them
it
looks
like
witchcraft
we
fancy
there
is
a
spell
upon
us
so
that
we
are
hampered
by
straws
and
entangled
in
cobwebs
we
believe
that
there
is
a
fatality
about
our
affairs
it
is
evidently
done
on
purpose
to
plague
us
a
demon
is
at
our
elbow
to
torment
and
defeat
us
in
everything
even
in
the
smallest
things
we
see
him
sitting
and
mocking
us
and
we
rave
and
gnash
our
teeth
at
him
in
return
it
is
particularly
hard
that
we
can
not
succeed
in
any
one
point
however
trifling
that
we
set
our
hearts
on
we
are
the
sport
of
imbecility
and
mischance
we
make
another
desperate
effort
and
fly
out
into
all
the
extravagance
of
impotent
rage
once
more
our
anger
runs
away
with
our
reason
because
as
there
is
little
to
give
it
birth
there
is
nothing
to
cheek
it
or
recall
us
to
our
senses
in
the
prospect
of
consequences
we
take
up
and
rend
in
pieces
the
mere
toys
of
humour
as
the
gusts
of
wind
take
up
and
whirl
about
chaff
and
stubble
passion
plays
the
tyrant
in
a
grand
style
over
the
lilliputian
difficulties
and
petty
disappointments
it
has
to
encounter
gives
way
to
all
the
fretfulness
of
grief
and
all
the
turbulence
of
resentment
makes
a
fuss
about
nothing
because
there
is
nothing
to
make
a
fuss
about
when
an
impending
calamity
an
irretrievable
loss
would
instantly
bring
it
to
its
recollection
and
tame
it
in
its
preposterous
career
a
man
may
be
in
a
great
passion
and
give
himself
strange
airs
at
so
simple
a
thing
as
a
game
at
ball
for
instance
may
rage
like
a
wild
beast
and
be
ready
to
dash
his
head
against
the
wall
about
nothing
or
about
that
which
he
will
laugh
at
the
next
minute
and
think
no
more
of
ten
minutes
after
at
the
same
time
that
a
good
smart
blow
from
the
ball
the
effects
of
which
he
might
feel
as
a
serious
inconvenience
for
a
month
would
calm
him
directly
anon
as
patient
as
the
female
dove
his
silence
will
sit
drooping
the
truth
is
we
pamper
little
griefs
into
great
ones
and
bear
great
ones
as
well
as
we
can
we
can
afford
to
dally
and
play
tricks
with
the
one
but
the
others
we
have
enough
to
do
with
without
any
of
the
wantonness
and
bombast
of
passion
without
the
swaggering
of
pistol
or
the
insolence
of
king
cambyses
vein
to
great
evils
we
submit
we
resent
little
provocations
i
have
before
now
been
disappointed
of
a
hundred
pound
job
and
lost
half
a
crown
at
rackets
on
the
same
day
and
been
more
mortified
at
the
latter
than
the
former
that
which
is
lasting
we
share
with
the
future
we
defer
the
consideration
of
till
that
which
belongs
to
the
moment
we
drink
up
in
all
its
bitterness
before
the
spirit
evaporates
we
probe
minute
mischiefs
to
the
quick
we
lacerate
tear
and
mangle
our
bosoms
with
misfortune
finest
brittlest
point
and
wreak
our
vengeance
on
ourselves
and
it
for
good
and
all
small
pains
are
more
manageable
ore
within
our
reach
we
can
fret
and
worry
ourselves
about
them
can
turn
them
into
any
shape
can
twist
and
torture
them
how
we
please
a
grain
of
sand
in
the
eye
a
thorn
in
the
flesh
only
irritates
the
part
and
leaves
us
strength
enough
to
quarrel
and
get
out
of
all
patience
with
it
a
heavy
blow
stuns
and
takes
away
all
power
of
sense
as
well
as
of
resistance
the
great
and
mighty
reverses
of
fortune
like
the
revolutions
of
nature
may
be
said
to
carry
their
own
weight
and
reason
along
with
them
they
seem
unavoidable
and
remediless
and
we
submit
to
them
without
murmuring
as
to
a
fatal
necessity
the
magnitude
of
the
events
in
which
we
may
happen
to
be
concerned
fills
the
mind
and
carries
it
out
of
itself
as
it
were
into
the
page
of
history
our
thoughts
are
expanded
with
the
scene
on
which
we
have
to
act
and
lend
us
strength
to
disregard
our
own
personal
share
in
it
some
men
are
indifferent
to
the
stroke
of
fate
as
before
and
after
earthquakes
there
is
a
calm
in
the
air
from
the
commanding
situation
whence
they
have
been
accustomed
to
view
things
they
look
down
at
themselves
as
only
a
part
of
the
whole
and
can
abstract
their
minds
from
the
pressure
of
misfortune
by
the
aid
of
its
very
violence
they
are
projected
in
the
explosion
of
events
into
a
different
sphere
far
from
their
former
thoughts
purposes
and
passions
the
greatness
of
the
change
anticipates
the
slow
effects
of
time
and
reflection
they
at
once
contemplate
themselves
from
an
immense
distance
and
look
up
with
speculative
wonder
at
the
height
on
which
they
stood
had
the
downfall
been
less
complete
it
would
have
been
more
galling
and
borne
with
less
resignation
because
there
might
still
be
a
chance
of
remedying
it
by
farther
efforts
and
farther
endurance
but
past
cure
past
hope
it
is
chiefly
this
cause
together
with
something
of
constitutional
character
which
has
enabled
the
greatest
man
in
modern
history
to
bear
his
reverses
of
fortune
with
gay
magnanimity
and
to
submit
to
the
loss
of
the
empire
of
the
world
with
as
little
discomposure
as
if
he
had
been
playing
a
game
at
chess
this
does
not
prove
by
our
theory
that
he
did
not
use
to
fly
into
violent
passions
with
talleyrand
for
plaguing
him
with
bad
news
when
things
went
wrong
he
was
mad
at
uncertain
forebodings
of
disaster
but
resigned
to
its
consummation
a
man
may
dislike
impertinence
yet
have
no
quarrel
with
necessity
there
is
another
consideration
that
may
take
off
our
wonder
at
the
firmness
with
which
the
principals
in
great
vicissitudes
of
fortune
bear
their
fate
which
is
that
they
are
in
the
secret
of
its
operations
and
know
that
what
to
others
appears
was
unavoidable
the
clearness
of
their
perception
of
all
the
circumstances
converts
the
uneasiness
of
doubt
into
certainty
they
have
not
the
qualms
of
conscience
which
their
admirers
have
who
can
not
tell
how
much
of
the
event
is
to
be
attributed
to
the
leaders
and
how
much
to
unforeseen
accidents
they
are
aware
either
that
the
result
was
not
to
be
helped
or
that
they
did
all
they
could
to
prevent
it
si
pergarna
dextra
defendi
possent
etiam
hac
defensa
fuissent
it
is
the
mist
and
obscurity
through
which
we
view
objects
that
makes
us
fancy
they
might
have
been
or
might
still
be
otherwise
the
precise
knowledge
of
antecedents
and
consequents
makes
men
practical
as
well
as
philosophical
it
is
the
want
of
this
knowledge
which
is
the
principle
and
soul
of
gambling
and
of
all
games
of
chance
or
partial
skill
the
supposition
is
that
the
issue
is
uncertain
and
that
there
is
no
positive
means
of
ascertaining
it
it
is
dependent
on
the
turn
of
a
die
on
the
tossing
up
of
a
halfpenny
to
be
fair
it
must
be
a
lottery
there
is
no
knowing
but
by
the
event
and
it
is
this
which
keeps
the
interest
alive
and
works
up
the
passion
little
short
of
madness
there
is
all
the
agitation
of
suspense
all
the
alternation
of
hope
and
fear
of
good
and
bad
success
all
the
eagerness
of
desire
without
the
possibility
of
reducing
this
to
calculation
that
is
of
subjecting
the
increased
action
of
the
will
to
a
known
rule
or
restraining
the
excesses
of
passion
within
the
bounds
of
reason
we
see
no
cause
beforehand
why
the
run
of
the
cards
should
not
be
in
our
favour
we
will
hear
of
none
afterwards
why
it
should
not
have
been
so
as
in
the
absence
of
all
data
to
judge
by
we
wantonly
fill
up
the
blank
with
the
most
extravagant
expectations
so
when
all
is
over
we
obstinately
recur
to
the
chance
we
had
previously
there
is
nothing
to
tame
us
down
to
the
event
nothing
to
reconcile
us
to
our
hard
luck
for
so
we
think
it
we
see
no
reason
why
we
failed
and
there
was
none
any
more
than
why
we
should
succeed
we
think
that
reason
apart
our
will
is
the
next
best
thing
we
still
try
to
have
it
our
own
way
and
fret
torment
and
harrow
ourselves
up
with
vain
imaginations
to
effect
impossibilities
we
play
the
game
over
again
we
wonder
how
it
was
possible
for
us
to
fail
we
turn
our
brain
with
straining
at
contradictions
and
striving
to
make
things
what
they
are
not
or
in
other
words
to
subject
the
course
of
nature
to
our
fastastical
wishes
it
had
been
so
if
we
had
done
such
and
such
a
we
try
it
in
a
thousand
different
ways
and
are
just
as
far
off
the
mark
as
ever
we
appealed
to
chance
in
the
first
instance
and
yet
when
it
has
decided
against
us
we
will
not
give
in
and
sit
down
contented
with
our
loss
but
refuse
to
submit
to
anything
but
reason
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
in
drawing
two
straws
for
example
to
see
which
is
the
longest
there
was
no
apparent
necessity
we
should
fix
upon
the
wrong
one
it
was
so
easy
to
have
fixed
upon
the
other
nay
at
one
time
we
were
going
to
do
it
if
we
had
the
mind
thus
runs
back
to
what
was
so
possible
and
feasible
at
one
time
while
the
thing
was
pending
and
would
fain
give
a
bias
to
causes
so
slender
and
insignificant
as
the
bends
his
body
to
give
a
bias
to
the
bowl
he
has
already
delivered
from
his
hand
not
considering
that
what
is
once
determined
be
the
causes
ever
so
trivial
or
evanescent
is
in
the
individual
instance
unalterable
indeed
to
be
a
great
philosopher
in
the
practical
and
most
important
sense
of
the
term
little
more
seems
necessary
than
to
be
convinced
of
the
truth
of
the
maxim
which
the
wise
man
repeated
to
the
daughter
of
king
cophetua
if
a
thing
is
it
is
and
there
is
an
end
of
it
we
often
make
life
unhappy
in
wishing
things
to
have
turned
out
otherwise
than
they
did
merely
because
that
is
possible
to
the
imagination
which
is
impossible
in
fact
i
remember
when
lamb
farce
was
damned
for
damned
it
was
that
certain
i
used
to
dream
every
night
for
a
month
after
and
then
i
vowed
i
would
plague
myself
no
more
about
it
that
it
was
revived
at
one
of
the
minor
or
provincial
theatres
with
great
success
that
such
and
such
retrenchments
and
alterations
had
been
made
in
it
and
that
it
was
thought
might
do
at
the
other
i
had
heard
indeed
this
was
told
in
confidence
to
lamb
that
lewis
was
present
on
the
night
of
its
performance
and
said
that
if
he
had
had
it
he
would
have
made
it
by
a
few
judicious
curtailments
most
popular
little
thing
that
had
been
brought
out
for
some
time
how
often
did
i
conjure
up
in
recollection
the
full
diapason
of
applause
at
the
end
of
the
and
hear
my
ingenious
friend
in
the
first
row
of
the
pit
roar
with
laughter
at
his
own
wit
then
i
dwelt
with
forced
complacency
on
some
part
in
which
it
had
been
doing
well
then
we
would
consider
in
concert
whether
the
long
tedious
opera
of
the
which
preceded
it
had
not
tired
people
beforehand
so
that
they
had
not
spirits
left
for
the
quaint
and
sparkling
skirmishes
of
the
dialogue
and
we
all
agreed
it
might
have
gone
down
after
a
tragedy
except
lamb
himself
who
swore
he
had
no
hopes
of
it
from
the
beginning
and
that
he
knew
the
name
of
the
hero
when
it
came
to
be
discovered
could
not
be
got
over
thou
wert
damned
bright
shone
the
morning
on
the
that
announced
thy
appearance
and
the
streets
were
filled
with
the
buzz
of
persons
asking
one
another
if
they
would
go
to
see
h
and
answering
that
they
would
certainly
but
before
night
the
gaiety
not
of
the
author
but
of
his
friends
and
the
town
was
eclipsed
for
thou
were
damned
hadst
thou
been
anonymous
thou
haply
mightst
have
lived
but
thou
didst
come
to
an
untimely
end
for
thy
tricks
and
for
want
of
a
better
name
to
pass
them
off
in
this
manner
we
go
back
to
the
critical
minutes
on
which
the
turn
of
our
fate
or
that
of
any
one
else
in
whom
we
are
interested
depended
try
them
over
again
with
new
knowledge
and
sharpened
sensibility
and
thus
think
to
alter
what
is
irrevocable
and
ease
for
a
moment
the
pang
of
lasting
regret
so
in
a
game
at
rackets
to
compare
small
things
with
great
i
think
if
at
such
a
point
i
had
followed
up
my
success
if
i
had
not
been
too
secure
or
in
another
part
if
i
had
played
for
such
an
opening
in
short
if
i
had
done
anything
but
what
i
did
and
what
has
proved
unfortunate
in
the
result
the
chances
were
all
in
my
favour
but
it
is
merely
because
i
do
not
know
what
would
have
happened
in
the
other
case
that
i
interpret
it
so
readily
to
my
own
advantage
i
have
sometimes
lain
awake
a
whole
night
trying
to
serve
out
the
last
ball
of
an
interesting
game
in
a
particular
corner
of
the
court
which
i
had
missed
from
a
nervous
feeling
rackets
i
might
observe
for
the
sake
of
the
uninformed
reader
is
like
any
other
athletic
game
very
much
a
thing
of
skill
and
practice
but
it
is
also
a
thing
of
opinion
to
all
the
skyey
influences
if
you
think
you
can
win
you
can
win
faith
is
necessary
to
victory
if
you
hesitate
in
striking
at
the
ball
it
is
ten
to
one
but
you
miss
it
if
you
are
apprehensive
of
committing
some
particular
error
such
as
striking
the
ball
you
will
be
nearly
sure
to
do
it
while
thinking
of
that
which
you
are
so
earnestly
bent
upon
avoiding
your
hand
mechanically
follows
the
strongest
idea
and
obeys
the
imagination
rather
than
the
intention
of
the
striker
a
run
of
luck
is
a
forerunner
of
success
and
courage
is
as
much
wanted
as
skill
no
one
is
however
free
from
nervous
sensations
at
times
a
good
player
may
not
be
able
to
strike
a
single
stroke
if
another
comes
into
the
court
that
he
has
a
particular
dread
of
and
it
frequently
so
happens
that
a
player
can
not
beat
another
even
though
he
can
give
half
the
game
to
an
equal
player
because
he
has
some
associations
of
jealousy
or
personal
pique
against
the
first
which
he
has
not
towards
the
last
haec
chess
is
a
game
i
do
not
understand
and
have
not
comprehension
enough
to
play
at
but
i
believe
though
it
is
so
much
less
a
thing
of
chance
than
science
or
skill
eager
players
pass
whole
nights
in
marching
and
countermarching
their
men
and
checkmating
a
successful
adversary
supposing
that
at
a
certain
point
of
the
game
they
had
determined
upon
making
a
particular
move
instead
of
the
one
which
they
actually
did
make
i
have
heard
a
story
of
two
persons
playing
at
backgammon
one
of
whom
was
so
enraged
at
losing
his
match
at
a
particular
point
of
the
game
that
he
took
the
board
and
threw
it
out
of
the
window
it
fell
upon
the
head
of
one
of
the
passengers
in
the
street
who
came
up
to
demand
instant
satisfaction
for
the
affront
and
injury
he
had
sustained
the
losing
gamester
only
asked
him
if
he
understood
backgammon
and
finding
that
he
did
said
that
if
upon
seeing
the
state
of
the
game
he
did
not
excuse
the
extravagance
of
his
conduct
he
would
give
him
any
other
satisfaction
he
wished
for
the
tables
were
accordingly
brought
and
the
situation
of
the
two
contending
parties
being
explained
the
gentleman
put
up
his
sword
and
went
away
perfectly
satisfied
to
return
from
this
which
to
some
will
seem
a
digression
and
to
others
will
serve
as
a
confirmation
of
the
doctrine
i
am
insisting
on
it
is
not
then
the
value
of
the
object
but
the
time
and
pains
bestowed
upon
it
that
determines
the
sense
and
degree
of
our
loss
many
men
set
their
minds
only
on
trifles
and
have
not
a
compass
of
soul
to
take
an
interest
in
anything
truly
great
and
important
beyond
forms
and
minutiae
such
persons
are
really
men
of
little
minds
or
may
be
complimented
with
the
title
of
great
children
pleased
with
a
feather
tickled
with
a
straw
larger
objects
elude
their
grasp
while
they
fasten
eagerly
on
the
light
and
insignificant
they
fidget
themselves
and
others
to
death
with
incessant
anxiety
about
nothing
a
part
of
their
dress
that
is
awry
keeps
them
in
a
fever
of
restlessness
and
impatience
they
sit
picking
their
teeth
or
paring
their
nails
or
stirring
the
fire
or
brushing
a
speck
of
dirt
off
their
coats
while
the
house
or
the
world
tumbling
about
their
ears
would
not
rouse
them
from
their
morbid
insensibility
they
can
not
sit
still
on
their
chairs
for
their
lives
though
if
there
were
anything
for
them
to
do
they
would
become
immovable
their
nerves
are
as
irritable
as
their
imaginations
are
callous
and
inert
they
are
addicted
to
an
inveterate
habit
of
littleness
and
perversity
which
rejects
every
other
motive
to
action
or
object
of
contemplation
but
the
daily
teasing
contemptible
familiar
favourite
sources
of
uneasiness
and
dissatisfaction
when
they
are
of
a
sanguine
instead
of
a
morbid
temperament
they
become
and
virtuosos

of
caterpillars
and
odd
volumes
makers
of

curious
in
will
wimble
dabbled
in
this
way
to
his
immortal
honour
but
many
others
have
been
less
successful
there
are
those
who
build
their
fame
on
epigrams
or
epitaphs
and
others
who
devote
their
lives
to
writing
the
lord
prayer
in
little
some
poets
compose
and
sing
their
own
verses
which
character
would
they
have
us
think
most
highly
of
the
poet
or
the
musician
the
great
is
one
some
there
are
who
feel
more
pride
in
sealing
a
letter
with
a
head
of
homer
than
ever
that
old
blind
bard
did
in
reciting
his
these
raise
a
huge
opinion
of
themselves
out
of
nothing
as
there
are
those
who
shrink
from
their
own
merits
into
the
shade
of
unconquerable
humility
i
know
one
person
at
least
who
would
rather
be
the
author
of
an
unsuccessful
farce
than
of
a
successful
tragedy
repeated
mortification
has
produced
an
inverted
ambition
in
his
mind
and
made
failure
the
bitter
test
of
desert
he
can
not
lift
his
drooping
head
to
gaze
on
the
gaudy
crown
of
popularity
placed
within
his
reach
but
casts
a
pensive
riveted
look
downwards
to
the
modest
flowers
which
the
multitude
trample
under
their
feet
if
he
had
a
piece
likely
to
succeed
coming
out
under
all
advantages
he
would
damn
it
by
some
wilful
jest
and
lose
the
favour
of
the
public
to
preserve
the
sense
of
his
personal
identity
shakespear
says
a
man
acquainted
with
strange
bedfellows
and
it
makes
our
thoughts
traitors
to
it
is
a
maxim
with
many
care
of
the
pence
and
the
pounds
will
take
care
of
themselves
those
only
put
it
in
practice
successfully
who
think
more
of
the
pence
than
of
the
pounds
to
such
a
large
sum
is
less
than
a
small
one
great
speculations
great
returns
are
to
them
extravagant
or
imaginary
a
few
hundreds
a
year
are
something
snug
and
comfortable
persons
who
have
been
used
to
a
petty
huckstering
way
of
life
can
not
enlarge
their
apprehensions
to
a
notion
of
anything
better
instead
of
launching
out
into
greater
expense
and
liberality
with
the
tide
of
fortune
they
draw
back
with
the
fear
of
consequences
and
think
to
succeed
on
a
broader
scale
by
dint
of
meanness
and
parsimony
my
uncle
toby
frequently
caught
trim
standing
up
behind
his
chair
when
he
had
told
him
to
be
seated
what
the
corporal
did
out
of
respect
others
would
do
out
of
servility
the
menial
character
does
not
wear
out
in
three
or
four
generations
you
can
not
keep
some
people
out
of
the
kitchen
merely
because
their
grandfathers
or
grandmothers
came
out
of
it
a
poor
man
and
his
wife
walking
along
in
the
neighbourhood
of
portland
place
he
said
to
her
peevishly
is
the
use
of
walking
along
these
fine
streets
and
squares
let
us
turn
down
some
alley
he
felt
he
should
be
more
at
home
there
lamb
said
of
an
old
acquaintance
of
his
that
when
he
was
young
he
wanted
to
be
a
tailor
but
had
not
spirit
this
is
the
misery
of
unequal
matches
the
woman
can
not
easily
forget
or
think
that
others
forget
her
origin
and
with
perhaps
superior
sense
and
beauty
keeps
painfully
in
the
background
it
is
worse
when
she
braves
this
conscious
feeling
and
displays
all
the
insolence
of
the
upstart
and
affected
fine
lady
but
shouldst
thou
ever
my
infelice
grace
my
home
with
thy
loved
presence
as
thou
hast
cheered
my
hopes
with
thy
smile
thou
wilt
conquer
all
hearts
with
thy
prevailing
gentleness
and
i
will
show
the
world
what
shakespear
women
were
some
gallants
set
their
hearts
on
princesses
others
descend
in
imagination
to
women
of
quality
others
are
mad
after
for
my
part
i
am
shy
even
of
actresses
and
should
not
think
of
leaving
my
card
with
madame
vestris
i
am
for
none
of
these
fortunes
but
for
a
list
of
humble
beauties
and
with
their
red
elbows
hard
hands
black
stockings
and
i
could
furnish
out
a
gallery
equal
to
cowley
and
paint
them
half
as
well
oh
might
i
but
attempt
a
description
of
some
of
them
in
poetic
prose
don
juan
would
forget
his
julia
and
davison
might
both
print
and
publish
this
volume
i
agree
so
far
with
horace
and
differ
with
montaigne
i
admire
the
clementinas
and
clarissas
at
a
distance
the
pamelas
and
fannys
of
richardson
and
fielding
make
my
blood
tingle
i
have
written
to
such
in
my
time
pathetique
a
faire
fendre
les
rochers
and
with
about
as
much
effect
as
if
they
had
been
addressed
to
stone
the
simpletons
only
laughed
and
said
that
were
not
the
sort
of
things
to
gain
the
affections
i
wish
i
had
kept
copies
in
my
own
justification
what
is
worse
i
have
an
utter
aversion
to
i
do
not
care
a
fig
for
any
woman
that
knows
even
what
an
author
means
if
i
know
that
she
has
read
anything
i
have
written
i
cut
her
acquaintance
immediately
this
sort
of
literary
intercourse
with
me
passes
for
nothing
her
critical
and
scientific
acquirements
are
coals
to
i
do
not
want
to
be
told
that
i
have
published
such
or
such
a
work
i
knew
all
this
before
it
makes
no
addition
to
my
sense
of
power
i
do
not
wish
the
affair
to
be
brought
about
in
that
way
i
would
have
her
read
my
soul
she
should
understand
the
language
of
the
heart
she
should
know
what
i
am
as
if
she
were
another
self
she
should
love
me
for
myself
alone
i
like
myself
without
any
reason
i
would
have
her
do
so
too
this
is
not
very
reasonable
i
abstract
from
my
temptations
to
admire
all
the
circumstances
of
dress
birth
breeding
fortune
and
i
would
not
willingly
put
forward
my
own
pretensions
whatever
they
may
be
the
image
of
some
fair
creature
is
engraven
on
my
inmost
soul
it
is
on
that
i
build
my
claim
to
her
regard
and
expect
her
to
see
into
my
heart
as
i
see
her
form
always
before
me
wherever
she
treads
pale
primroses
like
her
face
vernal
hyacinths
like
her
brow
spring
up
beneath
her
feet
and
music
hangs
on
every
bough
but
all
is
cold
barren
and
desolate
without
her
thus
i
feel
and
thus
i
think
but
have
i
over
told
her
so
no
or
if
i
did
would
she
understand
it
no
i
the
wind
i
worship
a
statue
cry
aloud
to
the
desert
to
see
beauty
is
not
to
be
beautiful
to
pine
in
love
is
not
to
be
loved
again
i
always
was
inclined
to
raise
and
magnify
the
power
of
love
i
thought
that
his
sweet
power
should
only
be
exerted
to
join
together
the
loveliest
forms
and
fondest
hearts
that
none
but
those
in
whom
his
godhead
shone
outwardly
and
was
inly
felt
should
ever
partake
of
his
triumphs
and
i
stood
and
gazed
at
a
distance
as
unworthy
to
mingle
in
so
bright
a
throng
and
did
not
even
for
a
moment
wish
to
tarnish
the
glory
of
so
fair
a
vision
by
being
myself
admitted
into
it
i
say
this
was
my
notion
once
but
god
knows
it
was
one
of
the
errors
of
my
youth
for
coming
nearer
to
look
i
saw
the
maimed
the
blind
and
the
halt
enter
in
the
crooked
and
the
dwarf
the
ugly
the
old
and
impotent
the
man
of
pleasure
and
the
man
of
the
world
the
dapper
and
the
pert
the
vain
and
shallow
boaster
the
fool
and
the
pedant
the
ignorant
and
brutal
and
all
that
is
farthest
removed
from
earth
and
the
pride
of
human
life
seeing
all
these
enter
the
courts
of
love
and
thinking
that
i
also
might
venture
in
under
favour
of
the
crowd
but
finding
myself
rejected
i
fancied
i
might
be
wrong
that
it
was
not
so
much
because
i
was
below
as
above
the
common
standard
i
did
feel
but
i
was
ashamed
to
feel
mortified
at
my
repulse
when
i
saw
the
meanest
of
mankind
the
very
scum
and
refuse
all
creeping
things
and
every
obscene
creature
enter
in
before
me
i
seemed
a
species
by
myself
i
took
a
pride
even
in
my
disgrace
and
concluded
i
had
elsewhere
my
inheritance
the
only
thing
i
ever
piqued
myself
upon
was
the
writing
the
on
the
principles
of
human
a
work
that
no
woman
ever
read
or
would
ever
comprehend
the
meaning
of
but
if
i
do
not
build
my
claim
to
regard
on
the
pretensions
i
have
how
can
i
build
it
on
those
i
am
totally
without
or
why
do
i
complain
and
expect
to
gather
grapes
of
thorns
or
figs
of
thistles
thought
has
in
me
cancelled
pleasure
and
this
dark
forehead
bent
upon
truth
is
the
rock
on
which
all
affection
has
split
and
thus
i
waste
my
life
in
one
long
sigh
nor
ever
till
too
late
beheld
a
gentle
face
turned
gently
upon
mine
but
no
not
too
late
if
that
face
pure
modest
downcast
tender
with
angel
sweetness
not
only
gladdens
the
prospect
of
the
future
but
sheds
its
radiance
on
the
past
smiling
in
tears
a
purple
light
hovers
round
my
head
the
air
of
love
is
in
the
room
as
i
look
at
my
copy
of
the
death
of

it
the

the
time

they

at

enter
i
am
in

the
sun
of
austerlitz
has
not
set
it
still
shines
here
in
my
heart
and
he
the
son
of

is
not
dead
nor
ever

to
me
i
am
as
when
my
life
began
the

all

i

not

i

unregarded

shall

poets
choose
mistresses
who
have
the
fewest
charms
that
they
may
make
something
out
of
nothing
they
succeed
best
in
fiction
and
they
apply
this
rule
to
love
they
make
a
goddess
of
any
dowdy
as
don
quixote
said
in
answer
to
the
remonstrances
of
sancho
that
dulcinea
del
toboso
answered
the
purpose
of
signalising
his
valour
just
as
well
as
the
princess
under

so
any
of
the
fair
sex
will
serve
them
to
write
about
just
as
well
as
another
they
take
some
awkward
thing
and
dress
her
up
in
fine
words
as
children
dress
up
a
wooden
doll
in
fine
clothes
perhaps
a
fine
head
of
hair
a
taper
waist
or
some
other
circumstance
strikes
them
and
they
make
the
rest
out
according
to
their
fancies
they
have
a
wonderful
knack
of
supplying
deficiencies
in
the
subjects
of
their
idolatry
out
of
the
storehouse
of
their
imaginations
they
presently
translate
their
favourites
to
the
skies
where
they
figure
with
berenice
locks
and
ariadne
crown
this
predilection
for
the
unprepossessing
and
insignificant
i
take
to
arise
not
merely
from
a
desire
in
poets
to
have
some
subject
to
exercise
their
inventive
talents
upon
but
from
their
jealousy
of
any
pretensions
even
those
of
beauty
in
the
other
sex
that
might
interfere
with
the
continual
incense
offered
to
their
personal
vanity
cardinal
mazarine
never
thought
anything
of
cardinal
de
retz
after
he
told
him
that
he
had
written
for
the
last
thirty
years
of
his
life
with
the
same
pen
some
italian
poet
going
to
present
a
copy
of
verses
to
the
pope
and
finding
as
he
was
looking
them
over
in
the
coach
as
he
went
a
mistake
of
a
single
letter
in
the
printing
broke
his
heart
of
vexation
and
chagrin
a
still
more
remarkable
case
of
literary
disappointment
occurs
in
the
history
of
a
countryman
of
his
which
i
can
not
refrain
from
giving
here
as
i
find
it
related
codrus
urceus
a
most
learned
and
unfortunate
italian
born
near
modena
was
a
striking
instance
says
his
biographer
the
miseries
men
bring
upon
themselves
by
setting
their
affections
unreasonably
on
trifles
this
learned
man
lived
at
forli
and
had
an
apartment
in
the
palace
his
room
was
so
very
dark
that
he
was
forced
to
use
a
candle
in
the
daytime
and
one
day
going
abroad
without
putting
it
out
his
library
was
set
on
fire
and
some
papers
which
he
had
prepared
for
the
press
were
burned
the
instant
he
was
informed
of
this
ill
news
he
was
affected
even
to
madness
he
ran
furiously
to
the
palace
and
stopping
at
the
door
of
his
apartment
he
cried
aloud
christ
jesus
what
mighty
crime
have
i
committed
whom
of
your
followers
have
i
ever
injured
that
you
thus
rage
with
inexpiable
hatred
against
me
then
turning
himself
to
an
image
of
the
virgin
mary
near
at
hand
virgin
says
he
hear
what
i
have
to
say
for
i
speak
in
earnest
and
with
a
composed
spirit
if
i
shall
happen
to
address
you
in
my
dying
moments
i
humbly
entreat
you
not
to
hear
me
nor
receive
me
into
heaven
for
i
am
determined
to
spend
all
eternity
in
hell
those
who
heard
these
blasphemous
expressions
endeavoured
to
comfort
him
but
all
to
no
purpose
for
the
society
of
mankind
being
no
longer
supportable
to
him
he
left
the
city
and
retired
like
savage
to
the
deep
solitude
of
a
wood
some
say
that
he
was
murdered
there
by
ruffians
others
that
he
died
at
bologna
in
after
much
contrition
and
penitence
perhaps
the
censure
passed
at
the
outset
of
the
anecdote
on
this
unfortunate
person
is
unfounded
and
severe
when
it
is
said
that
he
brought
his
miseries
on
himself
having
set
his
affections
unreasonably
on
trifles
to
others
it
might
appear
so
but
to
himself
the
labour
of
a
whole
life
was
hardly
a
trifle
his
passion
was
not
a
causeless
one
though
carried
to
such
frantic
excess
the
story
of
sir
isaac
newton
presents
a
strong
contrast
to
the
one
who
on
going
into
his
study
and
finding
that
his
dog
tray
had
thrown
down
a
candle
on
the
table
and
burnt
some
papers
of
great
value
contented
himself
with
exclaiming
tray
you
do
know
the
mischief
you
have
done
many
persons
would
not
forgive
the
overturning
a
cup
of
chocolate
so
soon
i
remember
hearing
an
instance
some
years
ago
of
a
man
of
character
and
property
who
through
unexpected
losses
had
been
condemned
to
a
long
and
heartbreaking
imprisonment
which
he
bore
with
exemplary
fortitude
at
the
end
of
four
years
by
the
interest
and
exertions
of
friends
he
obtained
his
discharge
with
every
prospect
of
beginning
the
world
afresh
and
had
made
his
arrangements
for
leaving
his
irksome
abode
and
meeting
his
wife
and
family
at
a
distance
of
two
hundred
miles
by
a
certain
day
owing
to
the
miscarriage
of
a
letter
some
signature
necessary
to
the
completion
of
the
business
did
not
arrive
in
time
and
on
account
of
the
informality
which
had
thus
arisen
he
could
not
set
out
home
till
the
return
of
the
post
which
was
four
days
longer
his
spirit
could
not
brook
the
delay
he
had
wound
himself
up
to
the
last
pitch
of
expectation
he
had
as
it
were
calculated
his
patience
to
hold
out
to
a
certain
point
and
then
to
throw
down
his
load
for
ever
and
he
could
not
find
resolution
to
resume
it
for
a
few
hours
beyond
this
he
put
an
end
to
the
intolerable
conflict
of
hope
and
disappointment
in
a
fit
of
excruciating
anguish
woes
that
we
have
time
to
foresee
and
leisure
to
contemplate
break
their
force
by
being
spread
over
a
larger
surface
and
borne
at
intervals
but
those
that
come
upon
us
suddenly
for
however
short
a
time
seem
to
insult
us
by
their
unnecessary
and
intrusion
and
the
very
prospect
of
relief
when
held
out
and
then
withdrawn
from
us
to
however
small
a
distance
only
frets
impatience
into
agony
by
tantalising
our
hopes
and
wishes
and
to
rend
asunder
the
thin
partition
that
separates
us
from
our
favourite
object
we
are
ready
to
burst
even
the
fetters
of
life
itself
i
am
not
aware
that
any
one
has
demonstrated
how
it
is
that
a
stronger
capacity
is
required
for
the
conduct
of
great
affairs
than
of
small
ones
the
organs
of
the
mind
like
the
pupil
of
the
eye
may
be
contracted
or
dilated
to
view
a
broader
or
a
narrower
surface
and
yet
find
sufficient
variety
to
occupy
its
attention
in
each
the
material
universe
is
infinitely
divisible
and
so
is
the
texture
of
human
affairs
we
take
things
in
the
gross
or
in
the
detail
according
to
the
occasion
i
think
i
could
as
soon
get
up
the
budget
of
ways
and
means
for
the
current
year
as
be
sure
of
making
both
ends
meet
and
paying
my
rent
at
in
a
paltry
huckster
shop
great
objects
move
on
by
their
own
weight
and
impulse
great
power
turns
aside
petty
obstacles
and
he
who
wields
it
is
often
but
the
puppet
of
circumstances
like
the
fly
on
the
wheel
that
said
a
dust
we
raise
it
is
easier
to
ruin
a
kingdom
and
aggrandise
one
own
pride
and
prejudices
than
to
set
up
a
greengrocer
stall
an
idiot
or
a
madman
may
do
this
at
any
time
whose
word
is
law
and
whose
nod
is
fate
nay
he
whose
look
is
obedience
and
who
understands
the
silent
wishes
of
the
great
may
easily
trample
on
the
necks
and
tread
out
the
liberties
of
a
mighty
nation
deriding
their
strength
and
hating
it
the
more
from
a
consciousness
of
his
own
meanness
power
is
not
wisdom
it
is
true
but
it
equally
ensures
its
own
objects
it
does
not
exact
but
dispenses
with
talent
when
a
man
creates
this
power
or
the
state
by
sage
counsels
and
bold
enterprises
it
is
a
different
thing
from
overturning
it
with
the
levers
that
are
put
into
his
baby
hands
in
general
however
it
may
be
argued
that
great
transactions
and
complicated
concerns
ask
more
genius
to
conduct
them
than
smaller
ones
for
this
reason
viz
that
the
mind
must
be
able
either
to
embrace
a
greater
variety
of
details
in
a
more
extensive
range
of
objects
or
must
have
a
greater
faculty
of
generalising
or
a
greater
depth
of
insight
into
ruling
principles
and
so
come
at
true
results
in
that
way
buonaparte
knew
everything
even
to
the
names
of
our
cadets
in
the
east
india
service
but
he
failed
in
this
that
he
did
not
calculate
the
resistance
which
barbarism
makes
to
refinement
he
thought
that
the
russians
could
not
burn
moscow
because
the
parisians
could
not
burn
paris
the
french
think
everything
must
be
french
the
cossacks
alas
do
not
conform
to
etiquette
the
rudeness
of
the
seasons
knows
no
rules
of
politeness
some
artists
think
it
a
test
of
genius
to
paint
a
large
picture
and
i
grant
the
truth
of
this
position
if
the
large
picture
contains
more
than
a
small
one
it
is
not
the
size
of
the
canvas
but
the
quantity
of
truth
and
nature
put
into
it
that
settles
the
point
it
is
a
mistake
common
enough
on
this
subject
to
suppose
that
a
miniature
is
more
finished
than
an
the
miniature
is
inferior
to
the
only
because
it
is
less
finished
because
it
can
not
follow
nature
into
so
many
individual
and
exact
particulars
the
proof
of
which
is
that
the
copy
of
a
good
portrait
will
always
make
a
highly
finished
miniature
see
for
example
mr
bone
enamels
whereas
the
copy
of
a
good
miniature
if
enlarged
to
the
size
of
life
will
make
but
a
very
sorry
portrait
several
of
our
best
artists
who
are
fond
of
painting
large
figures
invert
this
reasoning
they
make
the
whole
figure
gigantic
not
that
they
may
have
room
for
nature
but
for
the
motion
of
their
brush
as
if
they
were
painting
the
side
of
a
house
regarding
the
extent
of
canvas
they
have
to
cover
as
an
excuse
for
their
slovenly
and
hasty
manner
of
getting
over
it
and
thus
in
fact
leave
their
pictures
nothing
at
last
but
overgrown
miniatures
but
huge
caricatures
it
is
not
necessary
in
any
case
either
in
a
larger
or
a
smaller
compass
to
go
into
the
details
so
as
to
lose
sight
of
the
effect
and
decompound
the
face
into
porous
and
transparent
molecules
in
the
manner
of
denner
who
painted
what
he
saw
through
a
the
painter
eye
need
not
be
a
microscope
but
i
contend
that
it
should
be
a
bright
clear
lucid
the
in
art
begins
with
insignificant
parts
with
what
does
not
tell
in
connection
with
other
parts
the
true
artist
will
paint
not
material
points
but
in
a
word
wherever
there
is
feeling
or
expression
in
a
muscle
or
a
vein
there
is
grandeur
and
refinement
i
will
conclude
these
remarks
with
an
account
of
the
manner
in
which
the
ancient
sculptors
combined
great
and
little
things
in
such
matters
the
name
of
phidias
says
pliny
illustrious
among
all
the
nations
that
have
heard
of
the
fame
of
the
olympian
jupiter
no
one
doubts
but
in
order
that
those
may
know
that
he
is
deservedly
praised
who
have
not
even
seen
his
works
we
shall
offer
a
few
arguments
and
those
of
his
genius
only
nor
to
this
purpose
shall
we
insist
on
the
beauty
of
the
olympian
jupiter
nor
on
the
magnitude
of
the
minerva
at
athens
though
it
is
cubits
in
height
about
feet
and
is
made
of
ivory
and
gold
but
we
shall
refer
to
the
shield
on
which
the
battle
of
the
amazons
is
carved
on
the
outer
side
on
the
inside
of
the
same
is
the
fight
of
the
gods
and
giants
and
on
the
sandals
that
between
the
centaurs
and
lapithae
so
well
did
every
part
of
that
work
display
the
powers
of
the
art
again
the
sculptures
on
the
pedestal
he
called
the
birth
of
pandora
there
are
to
be
seen
in
number
thirty
gods
the
figure
of
victory
being
particularly
admirable
the
learned
also
admire
the
figures
of
the
serpent
and
the
brazen
sphinx
writhing
under
the
spear
these
things
are
mentioned
in
passing
of
an
artist
never
enough
to
be
commended
that
it
may
be
seen
that
he
showed
the
same
magnificence
even
in
small
things

this
essay
was
written
in
january
losing
gamesters
thus
become
desperate
because
the
continued
and
violent
irritation
of
the
will
against
a
run
of
ill
luck
drives
it
to
extremity
and
makes
it
bid
defiance
to
common
sense
and
every
consideration
of
prudence
or
some
of
the
poets
in
the
beginning
of
the

often
set
out
on

i
confess
my

of
a

beg
the

to
consider
this

viii
on
familiar
style
it
is
not
easy
to
write
a
familiar
style
many
people
mistake
a
familiar
for
a
vulgar
style
and
suppose
that
to
write
without
affectation
is
to
write
at
random
on
the
contrary
there
is
nothing
that
requires
more
precision
and
if
i
may
so
say
purity
of
expression
than
the
style
i
am
speaking
of
it
utterly
rejects
not
only
all
unmeaning
pomp
but
all
low
cant
phrases
and
loose
unconnected
allusions
it
is
not
to
take
the
first
word
that
offers
but
the
best
word
in
common
use
it
is
not
to
throw
words
together
in
any
combinations
we
please
but
to
follow
and
avail
ourselves
of
the
true
idiom
of
the
language
to
write
a
genuine
familiar
or
truly
english
style
is
to
write
as
any
one
would
speak
in
common
conversation
who
had
a
thorough
command
and
choice
of
words
or
who
could
discourse
with
ease
force
and
perspicuity
setting
aside
all
pedantic
and
oratorical
flourishes
or
to
give
another
illustration
to
write
naturally
is
the
same
thing
in
regard
to
common
conversation
as
to
read
naturally
is
in
regard
to
common
speech
it
does
not
follow
that
it
is
an
easy
thing
to
give
the
true
accent
and
inflection
to
the
words
you
utter
because
you
do
not
attempt
to
rise
above
the
level
of
ordinary
life
and
colloquial
speaking
you
do
not
assume
indeed
the
solemnity
of
the
pulpit
or
the
tone
of
neither
are
you
at
liberty
to
gabble
on
at
a
venture
without
emphasis
or
discretion
or
to
resort
to
vulgar
dialect
or
clownish
pronunciation
you
must
steer
a
middle
course
you
are
tied
down
to
a
given
and
appropriate
articulation
which
is
determined
by
the
habitual
associations
between
sense
and
sound
and
which
you
can
only
hit
by
entering
into
the
author
meaning
as
you
must
find
the
proper
words
and
style
to
express
yourself
by
fixing
your
thoughts
on
the
subject
you
have
to
write
about
any
one
may
mouth
out
a
passage
with
a
theatrical
cadence
or
get
upon
stilts
to
tell
his
thoughts
but
to
write
or
speak
with
propriety
and
simplicity
is
a
more
difficult
task
thus
it
is
easy
to
affect
a
pompous
style
to
use
a
word
twice
as
big
as
the
thing
you
want
to
express
it
is
not
so
easy
to
pitch
upon
the
very
word
that
exactly
fits
it
out
of
eight
or
ten
words
equally
common
equally
intelligible
with
nearly
equal
pretensions
it
is
a
matter
of
some
nicety
and
discrimination
to
pick
out
the
very
one
the
preferableness
of
which
is
scarcely
perceptible
but
decisive
the
reason
why
i
object
to
johnson
style
is
that
there
is
no
discrimination
no
selection
no
variety
in
it
he
uses
none
but
opaque
words
taken
from
the
row
of
the
rubric
words
with
the
greatest
number
of
syllables
or
latin
phrases
with
merely
english
terminations
if
a
fine
style
depended
on
this
sort
of
arbitrary
pretension
it
would
be
fair
to
judge
of
an
author
elegance
by
the
measurement
of
his
words
and
the
substitution
of
foreign
circumlocutions
with
no
precise
associations
for
the
how
simple
is
it
to
be
dignified
without
case
to
be
pompous
without
meaning
surely
it
is
but
a
mechanical
rule
for
avoiding
what
is
low
to
be
always
pedantic
and
affected
it
is
clear
you
can
not
use
a
vulgar
english
word
if
you
never
use
a
common
english
word
at
all
a
fine
tact
is
shown
in
adhering
to
those
which
are
perfectly
common
and
yet
never
falling
into
any
expressions
which
are
debased
by
disgusting
circumstances
or
which
owe
their
signification
and
point
to
technical
or
professional
allusions
a
truly
natural
or
familiar
style
can
never
be
quaint
or
vulgar
for
this
reason
that
it
is
of
universal
force
and
applicability
and
that
quaintness
and
vulgarity
arise
out
of
the
immediate
connection
of
certain
words
with
coarse
and
disagreeable
or
with
confined
ideas
the
last
form
what
we
understand
by
or
to
give
an
example
of
what
is
not
very
clear
in
the
general
statement
i
should
say
that
the
phrase
cut
with
a
knife
or
cut
a
piece
of
wood
is
perfectly
free
from
vulgarity
because
it
is
perfectly
common
but
cut
an
is
not
quite
unexceptionable
because
it
is
not
perfectly
common
or
intelligible
and
has
hardly
yet
escaped
out
of
the
limits
of
slang
phraseology
i
should
hardly
therefore
use
the
word
in
this
sense
without
putting
it
in
italics
as
a
license
of
expression
to
be
received
grano
all
provincial
or
come
under
the
same
mark
of
reprobation
all
such
as
the
writer
transfers
to
the
page
from
his
fireside
or
a
particular
or
that
he
invents
for
his
own
sole
use
and
convenience
i
conceive
that
words
are
like
money
not
the
worse
for
being
common
but
that
it
is
the
stamp
of
custom
alone
that
gives
them
circulation
or
value
i
am
fastidious
in
this
respect
and
would
almost
as
soon
coin
the
currency
of
the
realm
as
counterfeit
the
english
i
never
invented
or
gave
a
new
and
unauthorised
meaning
to
any
word
but
one
single
one
the
term
applied
to
feelings
and
that
was
in
an
abstruse
metaphysical
discussion
to
express
a
very
difficult
distinction
i
have
been
i
know
loudly
accused
of
revelling
in
vulgarisms
and
broken
english
i
can
not
speak
to
that
point
but
so
far
i
plead
guilty
to
the
determined
use
of
acknowledged
idioms
and
common
elliptical
expressions
i
am
not
sure
that
the
critics
in
question
know
the
one
from
the
other
that
is
can
distinguish
any
medium
between
formal
pedantry
and
the
most
barbarous
solecism
as
an
author
i
endeavour
to
employ
plain
words
and
popular
modes
of
construction
as
were
i
a
chapman
and
dealer
i
should
common
weights
and
measures
the
proper
force
of
words
lies
not
in
the
words
themselves
but
in
their
application
a
word
may
be
a
word
of
an
unusual
length
and
very
imposing
from
its
learning
and
novelty
and
yet
in
the
connection
in
which
it
is
introduced
may
be
quite
pointless
and
irrelevant
it
is
not
pomp
or
pretension
but
the
adaptation
of
the
expression
to
the
idea
that
clenches
a
writer
meaning
as
it
is
not
the
size
or
glossiness
of
the
materials
but
their
being
fitted
each
to
its
place
that
gives
strength
to
the
arch
or
as
the
pegs
and
nails
are
as
necessary
to
the
support
of
the
building
as
the
larger
timbers
and
more
so
than
the
mere
showy
unsubstantial
ornaments
i
hate
anything
that
occupies
more
space
than
it
is
worth
i
hate
to
see
a
load
of
bandboxes
go
along
the
street
and
i
hate
to
see
a
parcel
of
big
words
without
anything
in
them
a
person
who
does
not
deliberately
dispose
of
all
his
thoughts
alike
in
cumbrous
draperies
and
flimsy
disguises
may
strike
out
twenty
varieties
of
familiar
everyday
language
each
coming
somewhat
nearer
to
the
feeling
he
wants
to
convey
and
at
last
not
hit
upon
that
particular
and
only
one
which
may
be
said
to
be
identical
with
the
exact
impression
in
his
mind
this
would
seem
to
show
that
cobbett
is
hardly
right
in
saying
that
the
first
word
that
occurs
is
always
the
best
it
may
be
a
very
good
one
and
yet
a
better
may
present
itself
on
reflection
or
from
time
to
time
it
should
be
suggested
naturally
however
and
spontaneously
from
a
fresh
and
lively
conception
of
the
subject
we
seldom
succeed
by
trying
at
improvement
or
by
merely
substituting
one
word
for
another
that
we
are
not
satisfied
with
as
we
can
not
recollect
the
name
of
a
place
or
person
by
merely
plaguing
ourselves
about
it
we
wander
farther
from
the
point
by
persisting
in
a
wrong
scent
but
it
starts
up
accidentally
in
the
memory
when
we
least
expected
it
by
touching
some
link
in
the
chain
of
previous
association
there
are
those
who
hoard
up
and
make
a
cautious
display
of
nothing
but
rich
and
rare
phraseology
ancient
medals
obscure
coins
and
spanish
pieces
of
eight
they
are
very
curious
to
inspect
but
i
myself
would
neither
offer
nor
take
them
in
the
course
of
exchange
a
sprinkling
of
archaisms
is
not
amiss
but
a
tissue
of
obsolete
expressions
is
more
fit
keep
than
i
do
not
say
i
would
not
use
any
phrase
that
had
been
brought
into
fashion
before
the
middle
or
the
end
of
the
last
century
but
i
should
be
shy
of
using
any
that
had
not
been
employed
by
any
approved
author
during
the
whole
of
that
time
words
like
clothes
get
or
mean
and
ridiculous
when
they
have
been
for
some
time
laid
aside
lamb
is
the
only
imitator
of
old
english
style
i
can
read
with
pleasure
and
he
is
so
thoroughly
imbued
with
the
spirit
of
his
authors
that
the
idea
of
imitation
is
almost
done
away
there
is
an
inward
unction
a
marrowy
vein
both
in
the
thought
and
feeling
an
intuition
deep
and
lively
of
his
subject
that
carries
off
any
quaintness
or
awkwardness
arising
from
an
antiquated
style
and
dress
the
matter
is
completely
his
own
though
the
manner
is
assumed
perhaps
his
ideas
are
altogether
so
marked
and
individual
as
to
require
their
point
and
pungency
to
be
neutralised
by
the
affectation
of
a
singular
but
traditional
form
of
conveyance
tricked
out
in
the
prevailing
costume
they
would
probably
seem
more
startling
and
out
of
the
way
the
old
english
authors
burton
fuller
coryate
sir
thomas
browne
are
a
kind
of
mediators
between
us
and
the
more
eccentric
and
whimsical
modern
reconciling
us
to
his
peculiarities
i
do
not
however
know
how
far
this
is
the
case
or
not
till
he
condescends
to
write
like
one
of
us
i
must
confess
that
what
i
like
best
of
his
papers
under
the
signature
of
elia
still
i
do
not
presume
amidst
such
excellence
to
decide
what
is
most
excellent
is
the
account
of
battle
opinions
on
whist
which
is
also
the
most
free
from
obsolete
allusions
and
turns
of
expression
a
well
of
native
english
undefiled
to
those
acquainted
with
his
admired
prototypes
these
of
the
ingenious
and
highly
gifted
author
have
the
same
sort
of
charm
and
relish
that
erasmus
or
a
fine
piece
of
modern
latin
have
to
the
classical
scholar
certainly
i
do
not
know
any
borrowed
pencil
that
has
more
power
or
felicity
of
execution
than
the
one
of
which
i
have
here
been
speaking
it
is
as
easy
to
write
a
gaudy
style
without
ideas
as
it
is
to
spread
a
pallet
of
showy
colours
or
to
smear
in
a
flaunting
transparency
do
you
read
words
words
is
the
matter
it
might
be
answered
the
florid
style
is
the
reverse
of
the
familiar
the
last
is
employed
as
an
unvarnished
medium
to
convey
ideas
the
first
is
resorted
to
as
a
spangled
veil
to
conceal
the
want
of
them
when
there
is
nothing
to
be
set
down
but
words
it
costs
little
to
have
them
fine
look
through
the
dictionary
and
cull
out
a
rival
the
high
enough
and
never
mind
the
natural
complexion
the
vulgar
who
are
not
in
the
secret
will
admire
the
look
of
preternatural
health
and
vigour
and
the
fashionable
who
regard
only
appearances
will
be
delighted
with
the
imposition
keep
to
your
sounding
generalities
your
tinkling
phrases
and
all
will
be
well
swell
out
an
unmeaning
truism
to
a
perfect
tympany
of
style
a
thought
a
distinction
is
the
rock
on
which
all
this
brittle
cargo
of
verbiage
splits
at
once
such
writers
have
merely
imaginations
that
retain
nothing
but
words
or
their
puny
thoughts
have
all
green
and
gold
they
soar
far
above
the
vulgar
failing
of
the
humi
their
most
ordinary
speech
is
never
short
of
an
hyperbole
splendid
imposing
vague
incomprehensible
magniloquent
a
cento
of
sounding
if
some
of
us
whose
is
more
lowly
pry
a
little
too
narrowly
into
nooks
and
corners
to
pick
up
a
number
of
trifles
they
never
once
direct
their
eyes
or
lift
their
hands
to
seize
on
any
but
the
most
gorgeous
tarnished
threadbare
patchwork
set
of
phrases
the
finery
of
poetic
extravagance
transmitted
down
through
successive
generations
of
barren
pretenders
if
they
criticise
actors
and
actresses
a
huddled
phantasmagoria
of
feathers
spangles
floods
of
light
and
oceans
of
sound
float
before
their
morbid
sense
which
they
paint
in
the
style
of
ancient
pistol
not
a
glimpse
can
you
get
of
the
merits
or
defects
of
the
performers
they
are
hidden
in
a
profusion
of
barbarous
epithets
and
wilful
rhodomontade
our
hypercritics
are
not
thinking
of
these
little
fantoccini
beings
that
strut
and
fret
their
hour
upon
the
stage
but
of
tall
phantoms
of
words
abstractions
and
sweeping
clauses
periods
that
unite
the
poles
forced
alliterations
astounding
antitheses
and
on
their
pens
sits
plumed
if
they
describe
kings
and
queens
it
is
an
eastern
pageant
the
coronation
at
either
house
is
nothing
to
it
we
get
at
four
repeated
images
a
curtain
a
throne
a
sceptre
and
a
footstool
these
are
with
them
the
wardrobe
of
a
lofty
imagination
and
they
turn
their
servile
strains
to
servile
uses
do
we
read
a
description
of
pictures
it
is
not
a
reflection
of
tones
and
hues
which
own
sweet
and
cunning
hand
laid
on
but
piles
of
precious
stones
rubies
pearls
emeralds
golconda
mines
and
all
the
blazonry
of
art
such
persons
are
in
fact
besotted
with
words
and
their
brains
are
turned
with
the
glittering
but
empty
and
sterile
phantoms
of
things
personifications
capital
letters
seas
of
sunbeams
visions
of
glory
shining
inscriptions
the
figures
of
a
transparency
britannia
with
her

leaning
on
an
anchor
make
up
their
they
may
be
considered
as
writers
images
stand
out
in
their
minds
isolated
and
important
merely
in
themselves
without
any
groundwork
of
feeling
there
is
no
context
in
their
imaginations
words
affect
them
in
the
same
way
by
the
mere
sound
that
is
by
their
possible
not
by
their
actual
application
to
the
subject
in
hand
they
are
fascinated
by
first
appearances
and
have
no
sense
of
consequences
nothing
more
is
meant
by
them
than
meets
the
ear
they
understand
or
feel
nothing
more
than
meets
their
eye
the
web
and
texture
of
the
universe
and
of
the
heart
of
man
is
a
mystery
to
them
they
have
no
faculty
that
strikes
a
chord
in
unison
with
it
they
can
not
get
beyond
the
daubings
of
fancy
the
varnish
of
sentiment
objects
are
not
linked
to
feelings
words
to
things
but
images
revolve
in
splendid
mockery
words
represent
themselves
in
their
strange
rhapsodies
the
categories
of
such
a
mind
are
pride
and
ignorance
pride
in
outside
show
to
which
they
sacrifice
everything
and
ignorance
of
the
true
worth
and
hidden
structure
both
of
words
and
things
with
a
sovereign
contempt
for
what
is
familiar
and
natural
they
are
the
slaves
of
vulgar
affectation
of
a
routine
of
phrases
scorning
to
imitate
realities
they
are
unable
to
invent
anything
to
strike
out
one
original
idea
they
are
not
copyists
of
nature
it
is
true
but
they
are
the
poorest
of
all
plagiarists
the
plagiarists
of

all
is
dear
bought
artificial
oriental
in
subject
and

all
is
mechanical
conventional
vapid
formal
pedantic
in
style
and
execution
they
startle
and
confound
the
understanding
of
the
reader
by
the
remoteness
and
obscurity
of
their
illustrations
they
soothe
the
ear
by
the
monotony
of
the

everlasting
round
of
circuitous
metaphors
they
are
the
in

they
flounder
about
between
fustian
in
expression
and
bathos
in
sentiment
they
tantalise
the
fancy
but
never
reach
the
head
nor
touch
the

their
temple
of

is
like
a
shadowy
structure
raised

dulness
to
vanity

i
have
heard
of
such
a
thing
as
an
author
who
makes
it
a
rule
never
to
admit
a
monosyllable
into
his
vapid

the

essay
ix
on
effeminacy
of
character
effeminacy
of
character
arises
from
a
prevalence
of
the
sensibility
over
the
will
or
it
consists
in
a
want
of
fortitude
to
bear
pain
or
to
undergo
fatigue
however
urgent
the
occasion
we
meet
with
instances
of
people
who
can
not
lift
up
a
little
finger
to
save
themselves
from
ruin
nor
give
up
the
smallest
indulgence
for
the
sake
of
any
other
person
they
can
not
put
themselves
out
of
their
way
on
any
account
no
one
makes
a
greater
outcry
when
the
day
of
reckoning
comes
or
affects
greater
compassion
for
the
mischiefs
they
have
occasioned
but
till
the
time
comes
they
feel
nothing
they
care
for
nothing
they
live
in
the
present
moment
are
the
creatures
of
the
present
impulse
whatever
it
may
be
and
beyond
that
the
universe
is
nothing
to
them
the
slightest
toy
countervails
the
empire
of
the
world
they
will
not
forego
the
smallest
inclination
they
feel
for
any
object
that
can
be
proposed
to
them
or
any
reasons
that
can
be
urged
for
it
you
might
as
well
ask
of
the
gossamer
not
to
wanton
in
the
idle
summer
air
or
of
the
moth
not
to
play
with
the
flame
that
scorches
it
as
ask
of
these
persons
to
put
off
any
enjoyment
for
a
single
instant
or
to
gird
themselves
up
to
any
enterprise
of
pith
or
moment
they
have
been
so
used
to
a
studied
succession
of
agreeable
sensations
that
the
shortest
pause
is
a
privation
which
they
can
by
no
means
endure
it
is
like
tearing
them
from
their
very
existence
they
have
been
so
inured
to
ease
and
indolence
that
the
most
trifling
effort
is
like
one
of
the
tasks
of
hercules
a
thing
of
impossibility
at
which
they
shudder
they
lie
on
beds
of
roses
and
spread
their
gauze
wings
to
the
sun
and
summer
gale
and
can
not
bear
to
put
their
tender
feet
to
the
ground
much
less
to
encounter
the
thorns
and
briars
of
the
world
life
for
them
rolls
elysian
flowers
its
amber
stream
and
they
have
no
fancy
for
fishing
in
troubled
waters
the
ordinary
state
of
existence
they
regard
as
something
importunate
and
vain
and
out
of
nature
what
must
they
think
of
its
trials
and
sharp
vicissitudes
instead
of
voluntarily
embracing
pain
or
labour
or
danger
or
death
every
sensation
must
be
wound
up
to
the
highest
pitch
of
voluptuous
refinement
every
motion
must
be
grace
and
elegance
they
live
in
a
luxurious
endless
dream
or
die
of
a
rose
in
aromatic
pain
siren
sounds
must
float
around
them
smiling
forms
must
everywhere
meet
their
sight
they
must
tread
a
soft
measure
on
painted
carpets
or
lawns
books
arts
jests
laughter
occupy
every
thought
and
hour
what
have
they
to
do
with
the
drudgery
the
struggles
the
poverty
the
disease
or
anguish
which
are
the
common
lot
of
humanity
these
things
are
intolerable
to
them
even
in
imagination
they
disturb
the
enchantment
in
which
they
are
lapt
they
cause
a
wrinkle
in
the
clear
and
polished
surface
of
their
existence
they
exclaim
with
impatience
and
in
agony
leave
me
to
my
repose
how
shall
discourse
the
freezing
hours
away
when
wind
and
rain
beat
dark
december
down
or
the
pelting
of
the
pitiless
storm
gives
them
no
concern
it
never
once
enters
their
heads
they
close
the
shutters
draw
the
curtains
and
enjoy
or
shut
out
the
whistling
of
the
approaching
tempest
take
no
thought
for
the
morrow
not
they
they
do
not
anticipate
evils
let
them
come
when
they
will
come
they
will
not
run
to
meet
them
nay
more
they
will
not
move
one
step
to
prevent
them
nor
let
any
one
else
the
mention
of
such
things
is
shocking
the
very
supposition
is
a
nuisance
that
must
not
be
tolerated
the
idea
of
the
obviate
disagreeable
consequences
oppresses
them
to
death
is
an
exertion
too
great
for
their
enervated
imaginations
they
are
not
like
master
barnardine
in
for
who
would
not
up
to
be
hanged
they
would
not
get
up
to
avoid
being
hanged
they
are
completely
wrapped
up
in
themselves
but
then
all
their
is
concentrated
in
the
present
minute
they
have
worked
up
their
effeminate
and
fastidious
appetite
of
enjoyment
to
such
a
pitch
that
the
whole
of
their
existence
every
moment
of
it
must
be
made
up
of
these
exquisite
indulgences
or
they
will
fling
it
all
away
with
indifference
and
scorn
they
stake
their
entire
welfare
on
the
gratification
of
the
passing
instant
their
senses
their
vanity
their
thoughtless
gaiety
have
been
pampered
till
they
ache
at
the
smallest
suspension
of
their
perpetual
dose
of
excitement
and
they
will
purchase
the
hollow
happiness
of
the
next
five
minutes
by
a
mortgage
on
the
independence
and
comfort
of
years
they
must
have
their
will
in
everything
or
they
grow
sullen
and
peevish
like
spoiled
children
whatever
they
set
their
eyes
on
or
make
up
their
minds
to
they
must
have
that
instant
they
may
pay
for
it
hereafter
but
that
is
no
matter
they
snatch
a
joy
beyond
the
reach
of
fate
and
consider
the
present
time
sacred
inviolable
unaccountable
to
that
hard
churlish
niggard
inexorable
taskmaster
the
future
or
is
their
motto
they
are
madly
devoted
to
the
plaything
the
ruling
passion
of
the
moment
what
is
to
happen
to
them
a
week
hence
is
as
if
it
were
to
happen
to
them
a
thousand
years
hence
they
put
off
the
consideration
for
another
day
and
their
heedless
unconcern
laughs
at
it
as
a
fable
their
life
is
cell
of
ignorance
travelling
their
existence
is
ephemeral
their
thoughts
are
their
identity
expires
with
the
whim
the
folly
the
passion
of
the
hour
nothing
but
a
miracle
can
rouse
such
people
from
their
lethargy
it
is
not
to
be
expected
nor
is
it
even
possible
in
the
natural
course
of
things
pope
striking
exclamation
oh
blindness
to
the
future
kindly
given
that
each
may
fill
the
circuit
mark
by
heaven
hardly
applies
here
namely
to
evils
that
stare
us
in
the
face
and
that
might
be
averted
with
the
least
prudence
or
resolution
but
nothing
can
be
done
how
should
it
a
slight
evil
a
distant
danger
will
not
move
them
and
a
more
imminent
one
only
makes
them
turn
away
from
it
in
greater
precipitation
and
alarm
the
more
desperate
their
affairs
grow
the
more
averse
they
are
to
look
into
them
and
the
greater
the
effort
required
to
retrieve
them
the
more
incapable
they
are
of
it
at
first
they
will
not
do
anything
and
afterwards
it
is
too
late
the
very
motives
that
imperiously
urge
them
to
and
amendment
combine
with
their
natural
disposition
to
prevent
it
this
amounts
pretty
nearly
to
a
mathematical
demonstration
ease
vanity
pleasure
are
the
ruling
passions
in
such
cases
how
will
you
conquer
these
or
wean
their
infatuated
votaries
from
them
by
the
dread
of
hardship
disgrace
pain
they
turn
from
them
and
you
who
point
them
out
as
the
alternative
with
sickly
disgust
and
instead
of
a
stronger
effort
of
courage
or
to
avert
the
crisis
hasten
it
by
a
wilful
determination
to
pamper
the
disease
in
every
way
and
arm
themselves
not
with
fortitude
to
bear
or
to
repel
the
consequences
but
with
judicial
blindness
to
their
approach
will
you
rouse
the
indolent
procrastinator
to
an
irksome
but
necessary
effort
by
showing
him
how
much
he
has
to
do
he
will
only
draw
back
the
more
for
all
your
entreaties
and
representations
if
of
a
sanguine
turn
he
will
make
a
slight
attempt
at
a
new
plan
of
life
be
satisfied
with
the
first
appearance
of
reform
and
relapse
into
indolence
again
if
timid
and
undecided
the
hopelessness
of
the
undertaking
will
put
him
out
of
heart
with
it
and
he
will
stand
still
in
despair
will
you
save
a
vain
man
from
ruin
by
pointing
out
the
obloquy
and
ridicule
that
await
him
in
his
present
career
he
smiles
at
your
forebodings
as
fantastical
or
the
more
they
are
realised
around
him
the
more
he
is
impelled
to
keep
out
the
galling
conviction
and
the
more
fondly
he
clings
to
flattery
and
death
he
will
not
make
a
bold
and
resolute
attempt
to
recover
his
reputation
because
that
would
imply
that
it
was
capable
of
being
soiled
or
injured
or
he
no
sooner
meditates
some
desultory
project
than
he
takes
credit
to
himself
for
the
execution
and
is
delighted
to
wear
his
unearned
laurels
while
the
thing
is
barely
talked
of
the
chance
of
success
relieves
the
uneasiness
of
his
apprehensions
so
that
he
makes
use
of
the
interval
only
to
flatter
his
favourite
infirmity
again
would
you
wean
a
man
from
sensual
excesses
by
the
inevitable
consequences
to
which
they
lead
what
holds
more
antipathy
to
pleasure
than
pain
the
mind
given
up
to
revolts
at
suffering
and
throws
it
from
it
as
an
unaccountable
anomaly
as
a
piece
of
injustice
when
it
comes
much
less
will
it
acknowledge
any
affinity
with
or
subjection
to
it
as
a
mere
threat
if
the
prediction
does
not
immediately
come
true
we
laugh
at
the
prophet
of
ill
if
it
is
verified
we
hate
our
adviser
proportionably
hug
our
vices
the
closer
and
hold
them
dearer
and
more
precious
the
more
they
cost
us
we
resent
wholesome
counsel
as
an
impertinence
and
consider
those
who
warn
us
of
impending
mischief
as
if
they
had
brought
it
on
our
heads
we
cry
out
with
the
poetical
enthusiast
and
let
us
nurse
the
fond
deceit
and
what
if
we
must
die
in
sorrow
who
would
not
cherish
dreams
so
sweet
though
grief
and
pain
should
come
but
oh
thou
who
didst
lend
me
speech
when
i
was
dumb
to
whom
i
owe
it
that
i
have
not
crept
on
my
belly
all
the
days
of
my
life
like
the
serpent
but
sometimes
lift
my
forked
crest
or
tread
the
empyrean
wake
thou
out
of
thy
slumbers
shake
off
the
heavy
honeydew
of
thy
soul
no
longer
lulled
with
that
circean
cup
drinking
thy
own
thoughts
with
thy
own
ears
but
start
up
in
thy
promised
likeness
and
shake
the
pillared
rottenness
of
the
world
leave
not
thy
sounding
words
in
air
write
them
in
marble
and
teach
the
coming
age
heroic
truths
up
and
wake
the
echoes
of
time
rich
in
deepest
lore
die
not
the
churl
of
knowledge
leaving
the
survivors
unblest
set
set
as
thou
didst
rise
in
pomp
and
gladness
dart
like
the
sunflower
one
broad
golden
flash
of
light
and
ere
thou
ascendest
thy
native
sky
show
us
the
steps
by
which
thou
didst
scale
the
heaven
of
philosophy
with
truth
and
fancy
for
thy
equal
guides
that
we
may
catch
thy
mantle
and
still
read
thy
words
dear
to
memory
dearer
to
fame
there
is
another
branch
of
this
character
which
is
the
trifling
or
dilatory
character
such
persons
are
always
creating
difficulties
and
unable
or
unwilling
to
remove
them
they
can
not
brush
aside
a
cobweb
and
are
stopped
by
an
insect
wing
their
character
is
imbecility
rather
than
effeminacy
the
want
of
energy
and
resolution
in
the
persons
last
described
arises
from
the
habitual
and
inveterate
predominance
of
other
feelings
and
motives
in
these
it
is
a
mere
want
of
energy
and
resolution
that
is
an
inherent
natural
defect
of
vigour
of
nerve
and
voluntary
power
there
is
a
specific
levity
about
such
persons
so
that
you
can
not
propel
them
to
any
object
or
give
them
a
decided
in
any
direction
or
pursuit
they
turn
back
as
it
were
on
the
occasion
that
should
project
them
forward
with
manly
force
and
vehemence
they
shrink
from
intrepidity
of
purpose
and
are
alarmed
at
the
idea
of
attaining
their
end
too
soon
they
will
not
act
with
steadiness
or
spirit
either
for
themselves
or
you
if
you
chalk
out
a
line
of
conduct
for
them
or
commission
them
to
execute
a
certain
task
they
are
sure
to
conjure
up
some
insignificant
objection
or
fanciful
impediment
in
the
way
and
are
withheld
from
striking
an
effectual
blow
by
mere
feebleness
of
character
they
may
be
officious
friendly
generous
in
disposition
but
they
are
of
no
use
to
any
one
they
will
put
themselves
to
twice
the
trouble
you
desire
not
to
carry
your
point
but
to
defeat
it
and
in
obviating
needless
objections
neglect
the
main
business
if
they
do
what
you
want
it
is
neither
at
the
time
nor
in
the
manner
that
you
wish
this
timidity
amounts
to
treachery
for
by
always
anticipating
some
misfortune
or
disgrace
they
realise
their
unmeaning
apprehensions
the
little
bears
sway
in
their
minds
over
the
great
a
small
inconvenience
outweighs
a
solid
and
indispensable
advantage
and
their
strongest
bias
is
uniformly
derived
from
the
weakest
motive
they
hesitate
about
the
best
way
of
beginning
a
thing
till
the
opportunity
for
action
is
lost
and
are
less
anxious
about
its
being
done
than
the
precise
manner
of
doing
it
they
will
destroy
a
passage
sooner
than
let
an
objectionable
word
pass
and
are
much
less
concerned
about
the
truth
or
the
beauty
of
an
image
than
about
the
reception
it
will
meet
with
from
the
critics
they
alter
what
they
write
not
because
it
is
but
because
it
may
possibly
be
wrong
and
in
their
tremulous
solicitude
to
avoid
imaginary
blunders
run
into
real
ones
what
is
curious
enough
is
that
with
all
this
caution
and
delicacy
they
are
continually
liable
to
extraordinary
oversights
they
are
in
fact
so
full
of
all
sorts
of
idle
apprehensions
that
they
do
not
know
how
to
distinguish
real
from
imaginary
grounds
of
apprehension
and
they
often
give
some
unaccountable
offence
either
from
assuming
a
sudden
boldness
half
in
sport
or
while
they
are
secretly
pluming
themselves
on
their
dexterity
in
avoiding
everything
exceptionable
and
the
same
distraction
of
motive
and
shortsightedness
which
gets
them
into
scrapes
hinders
them
from
seeing
their
way
out
of
them
such
persons
often
of
ingenious
and
susceptible
minds
are
constantly
at
with
themselves
and
others
will
neither
do
things
nor
let
others
do
them
and
whether
they
succeed
or
fail
never
feel
confident
or
at
their
case
they
spoil
the
freshness
and
originality
of
their
own
thoughts
by
asking
contradictory
advice
and
in
befriending
others
while
they
are
it
and
about
it
you
might
have
done
the
thing
yourself
a
dozen
times
over
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
esteemed
than
a
manly
firmness
and
decision
of
character
i
like
a
person
who
knows
his
own
mind
and
sticks
to
it
who
sees
at
once
what
is
to
be
done
in
given
circumstances
and
does
it
he
does
not
beat
about
the
bush
for
difficulties
or
excuses
but
goes
the
shortest
and
most
effectual
way
to
work
to
attain
his
own
ends
or
to
accomplish
a
useful
object
if
he
can
serve
you
he
will
do
so
if
he
can
not
he
will
say
so
without
keeping
you
in
needless
suspense
or
laying
you
under
pretended
obligations
the
applying
to
him
in
any
laudable
undertaking
is
not
like
stirring
dish
of
skimmed
milk
there
is
stuff
in
him
and
it
is
of
the
right
practicable
sort
he
is
not
all
his
life
at
whether
he
shall
be
a
whig
or
a
tory
a
friend
or
a
foe
a
knave
or
a
fool
but
thinks
that
life
is
short
and
that
there
is
no
time
to
play
fantastic
tricks
in
it
to
tamper
with
principles
or
trifle
with
individual
feelings
if
he
gives
you
a
character
he
does
not
add
a
damning
clause
to
it
he
does
not
pick
holes
in
you
lest
others
should
or
anticipate
objections
lest
he
should
be
thought
to
be
blinded
by
a
childish
partiality
his
object
is
to
serve
you
and
not
to
play
the
game
into
your
enemies
hands
a
generous
friendship
no
cold
medium
knows
burns
with
one
love
with
one
resentment
glows
i
should
be
sorry
for
any
one
to
say
what
he
did
not
think
of
me
but
i
should
not
be
pleased
to
see
him
slink
out
of
his
acknowledged
opinion
lest
it
should
not
be
confirmed
by
malice
or
stupidity
he
who
is
well
acquainted
and
well
inclined
to
you
ought
to
give
the
tone
not
to
receive
it
from
others
and
may
set
it
to
what
key
he
pleases
in
certain
cases
there
are
those
of
whom
it
has
been
said
that
to
them
an
obligation
is
a
reason
for
not
doing
anything
and
there
are
others
who
are
invariably
led
to
do
the
reverse
of
what
they
should
the
last
are
perverse
the
first
impracticable
people
opposed
to
the
effeminate
in
disposition
and
manners
are
the
coarse
and
brutal
as
those
were
all
softness
and
smoothness
these
affect
or
are
naturally
attracted
to
whatever
is
vulgar
and
violent
harsh
and
repulsive
in
tone
in
modes
of
speech
in
forms
of
address
in
gesture
and
behaviour
thus
there
are
some
who
ape
the
lisping
of
the
fine
lady
the
drawling
of
the
fine
gentleman
and
others
who
all
their
life
delight
in
and
catch
the
uncouth
dialect
the
manners
and
expressions
of
clowns
and
hoydens
the
last
are
governed
by
an
instinct
of
the
disagreeable
by
an
appetite
and
headlong
rage
for
violating
decorum
and
hurting
other
people
feelings
their
own
being
excited
and
enlivened
by
the
shock
they
deal
in
home
truths
unpleasant
reflections
and
unwelcome
matters
of
fact
as
the
others
are
all
compliment
and
complaisance
insincerity
and
insipidity
we
may
observe
an
effeminacy
of
style
in
some
degree
corresponding
to
effeminacy
of
character
writers
of
this
stamp
are
great
interliners
of
what
they
indite
alterers
of

understood
to
mean
one
that
is

florid
all
fine
that
cloys
by
its
sweetness
and
tires
by

such
are
what
dryden
calls
peaceable
writers
they
only
aim
to
please
and
never
offend
by
truth
or
disturb
by
singularity
every
thought
must
be
beautiful
every
expression
equally
fine
they
do
not
delight
in
vulgarisms
but
in
and
dress
out
unmeaning
forms
in
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
they
do
not
go
out
of
their
way
to
think
that
would
startle
the
indolence
of
the
reader
they
can
not
express
a
trite
thought
in

that
would
be
a
sacrifice
of
their
own
vanity
they
are
not

description
which
is
now
nearly
exploded
lord
byron
is
a
pampered
and
aristocratic
writer
but
he
is
not
effeminate
or
we
should
not
have
his
works
with
only
the
name
to
them
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
the
fault
of
poems
was
a
deficiency
in
masculine
energy
of
style
he
had
beauty
tenderness
delicacy
in
an
uncommon
degree
but
there
was
a
want
of
strength
and
substance
his
is
a
very
delightful
description
of
the
illusions
of
a
youthful
imagination
given
up
to
airy
dreams
we
have
flowers
clouds
rainbows
moonlight
all
sweet
sounds
and
smells
and
oreads
and
dryads
flitting
by
but
there
is
nothing
tangible
in
it
nothing
marked
or
palpable
we
have
none
of
the
hardy
spirit
or
rigid
forms
of
antiquity
he
painted
his
own
thoughts
and
character
and
did
not
transport
himself
into
the
fabulous
and
heroic
ages
there
is
a
want
of
action
of
character
and
so
far
of
imagination
but
there
is
exquisite
fancy
all
is
soft
and
fleshy
without
bone
or
muscle
we
see
in
him
the
youth
without
the
manhood
of
poetry
his
genius
breathed
delight
and
joy
maia
son
he
stood
and
shook
his
plumes
with
fragrance
filled
his
mind
was
redolent
of
spring
he
had
not
the
fierceness
of
summer
nor
the
richness
of
autumn
and
winter
he
seemed
not
to
have
known
till
he
felt
the
icy
hand
of
death

distant
objects
please
because
in

they
imply
an
idea

and
because
not

obtruded

close
upon

we
clothe
them
with
the
indistinct
and
airy
colours
of
fancy
in
looking

the

that

we

rarefied
expanded
melt
into

and

turning
to
ethereal

we
drink
the

before
us
and
borrow
a
more
refined
existence
from
objects
that
hover
on
the
brink
of
nothing
where
the

fades
from
the
dull
sight
we
fill
the
thin
viewless
space
with
shapes
of
unknown
good
and
tinge
the
hazy
prospect
with
hopes
and

and
more
charming
fears
but
thou
oh
hope
with
eyes
so
fair
what
was
thy
delighted
measure
still
it
whisper
promised
pleasure
and
bade
the
lovely
scenes
at

hail
whatever
is
placed
beyond
the
reach
of
sense
and

whatever
is
imperfectly
discerned

out
at

the

passion

it

passion
is
lord
of
infinite
space
and
distant
objects
please
because
they
border
on
its
confines
and
are
moulded
by
its
touch
when
i
was
a
boy
i
lived
within
sight
of
a
range
of
lofty
hills
whose
blue
tops
blending
with
the
setting
sun
had
often
tempted
my
longing
eyes
and
wandering
feet
at
last
i
put
my
project
in
execution
and
on
a
nearer
approach
instead
of
glimmering
air
woven
into
fantastic
shapes
found
them
huge
lumpish
heaps
of
discoloured
earth
i
learnt
from
this
in
part
to
leave
unvisited
and
not
idly
to
disturb
a
dream
of
good
distance
of
time
has
much
the
same
effect
as
distance
of
place
it
is
not
surprising
that
fancy
colours
the
prospect
of
the
future
as
it
thinks
good
when
it
even
effaces
the
forms
of
memory
time
takes
out
the
sting
of
pain
our
sorrows
after
a
certain
period
have
been
so
often
steeped
in
a
medium
of
thought
and
passion
that
they
their
essence
and
all
that
remains
of
our
original
impressions
is
what
we
would
wish
them
to
have
been
not
only
the
untried
steep
ascent
before
us
but
the
rude
unsightly
masses
of
our
past
experience
presently
resume
their
power
of
deception
over
the
eye
the
golden
cloud
soon
rests
upon
their
heads
and
the
purple
light
of
fancy
clothes
their
barren
sides
thus
we
pass
on
while
both
ends
of
our
existence
touch
upon
heaven
there
is
so
to
speak
mighty
stream
of
to
good
in
the
human
mind
upon
which
all
objects
float
and
are
imperceptibly
borne
along
and
though
in
the
voyage
of
life
we
meet
with
strong
rebuffs
with
rocks
and
quicksands
yet
there
is
tide
in
the
affairs
of
men
a
heaving
and
a
restless
aspiration
of
the
soul
by
means
of
which
sails
and
tackle
torn
the
wreck
and
scattered
fragments
of
our
entire
being
drift
into
the
port
and
haven
of
our
desires
in
all
that
relates
to
the
affections
we
put
the
will
for
the
deed
so
that
the
instant
the
pressure
of
unwelcome
circumstances
is
removed
the
mind
recoils
from
their
hold
recovers
its
elasticity
and
reunites
itself
to
that
image
of
good
which
is
but
a
reflection
and
configuration
of
its
own
nature
seen
in
the
distance
in
the
long
perspective
of
waning
years
the
meanest
incidents
enlarged
and
enriched
by
countless
recollections
become
interesting
the
most
painful
broken
and
softened
by
time
soothe
how
any
object
that
unexpectedly
brings
back
to
us
old
scenes
and
associations
startles
the
mind
what
a
yearning
it
creates
within
us
what
a
longing
to
leap
the
intermediate
space
how
fondly
we
cling
to
and
try
to
revive
the
impression
of
all
that
we
then
were
such
tricks
hath
strong
imagination
in
truth
we
impose
upon
ourselves
and
know
not
what
we
wish
it
is
a
cunning
artifice
a
quaint
delusion
by
which
in
pretending
to
be
what
we
were
at
a
particular
moment
of
time
we
would
fain
be
all
that
we
have
since
been
and
have
our
lives
to
come
over
again
it
is
not
the
little
glimmering
almost
annihilated
speck
in
the
distance
that
rivets
our
attention
and
upon
the
beatings
of
our
hearts
it
is
the
interval
that
separates
us
from
it
and
of
which
it
is
the
trembling
boundary
that
excites
all
this
coil
and
mighty
pudder
in
the
breast
into
that
great
gap
in
our
being
thronging
soft
desires
and
infinite
regrets
it
is
the
contrast
the
change
from
what
we
then
were
that
arms
the
recollection
with
its
giant
strength
and
lifts
the
fabric
of
the
affections
from
its
shadowy
base
in
contemplating
its
utmost
verge
we
overlook
the
map
of
our
existence
and
in
apprehension
the
journey
of
life
so
it
is
that
in
early
youth
we
strain
our
eager
sight
after
the
pursuits
of
manhood
and
as
we
are
sliding
off
the
stage
strive
to
gather
up
the
toys
and
flowers
that
pleased
our
thoughtless
childhood
when
i
was
quite
a
boy
my
father
used
to
take
me
to
the
montpelier
tea
gardens
at
walworth
do
i
go
there
now
no
the
place
is
deserted
and
its
borders
and
its
beds
is
there
then
nothing
that
can
bring
back
the
hour
of
glory
in
the
grass
of
splendour
in
the
flower
oh
yes
i
unlock
the
casket
of
memory
and
draw
back
the
warders
of
the
brain
and
there
this
scene
of
my
infant
wanderings
still
lives
unfaded
or
with
fresher
dyes
a
new
sense
comes
upon
me
as
in
a
dream
a
richer
perfume
brighter
colours
start
out
my
eyes
dazzle
my
heart
heaves
with
its
new
load
of
bliss
and
i
am
a
child
again
my
sensations
are
all
glossy
spruce
voluptuous
and
fine
they
wear
a
candied
coat
and
are
in
holiday
trim
i
see
the
beds
of
larkspur
with
purple
eyes
tall
hollyhocks
red
or
yellow
the
broad
sunflowers
caked
in
gold
with
bees
buzzing
round
them
wildernesses
of
pinks
and
hot
glowing
peonies
poppies
run
to
seed
the
sugared
lily
and
faint
mignonette
all
ranged
in
order
and
as
thick
as
they
can
grow
the
borders
the
the
painted
alcove
the
confectionery
the
clotted
cream
i
think
i
see
them
now
with
sparkling
looks
or
have
they
vanished
while
i
have
been
writing
this
description
of
them
no
matter
they
will
return
again
when
i
least
think
of
them
all
that
i
have
observed
since
of
flowers
and
plants
and
and
of
suburb
delights
seems
to
me
borrowed
from
first
garden
of
my
innocence
to
be
slips
and
scions
stolen
from
that
bed
of
memory
in
this
manner
the
darlings
of
our
childhood
burnish
out
in
the
eye
of
after
years
and
derive
their
sweetest
perfume
from
the
first
heartfelt
sigh
of
pleasure
breathed
upon
them
like
the
sweet
south
that
breathes
upon
a
bank
of
violets
stealing
and
giving
odour
if
i
have
pleasure
in
a
i
have
in
a
too
and
for
the
same
reason
if
i
see
a
row
of
or
of
peas
or
beans
coming
up
i
immediately
think
of
those
which
i
used
so
carefully
to
water
of
an
evening
at
wem
when
my
day
tasks
were
done
and
of
the
pain
with
which
i
saw
them
droop
and
hang
down
their
leaves
in
the
morning
sun
again
i
never
see
a
child
kite
in
the
air
but
it
seems
to
pull
at
my
heart
it
is
to
me
thing
of
life
i
feel
the
twinge
at
my
elbow
the
flutter
and
palpitation
with
which
i
used
to
let
go
the
string
of
my
own
as
it
rose
in
the
air
and
towered
among
the
clouds
my
little
cargo
of
hopes
and
fears
ascended
with
it
and
as
it
made
a
part
of
my
own
consciousness
then
it
does
so
still
and
appears
some
gay
creature
of
the
element
my
playmate
when
life
was
young
and
with
my
earliest
recollections
i
could
enlarge
on
this
subject
of
childish
amusements
but
leigh
hunt
has
treated
it
so
well
in
a
paper
in
the
on
the
productions
of
the
of
the
metropolis
that
if
i
were
to
insist
more
on
it
i
should
only
pass
for
an
imitator
of
that
ingenious
and
agreeable
writer
for
an
indifferent
one
into
the
sounds
smells
and
sometimes
tastes
are
remembered
longer
than
visible
objects
and
serve
perhaps
better
for
links
in
the
chain
of
association
the
reason
seems
to
be
this
they
are
in
their
nature
intermittent
and
comparatively
rare
whereas
objects
of
sight
are
always
before
us
and
by
their
continuous
succession
drive
one
another
out
the
eye
is
always
open
and
between
any
given
impression
and
its
recurrence
a
second
time
fifty
thousand
other
impressions
have
in
all
likelihood
been
stamped
upon
the
sense
and
on
the
brain
the
other
senses
are
not
so
active
or
vigilant
they
are
but
seldom
called
into
play
the
ear
for
example
is
oftener
courted
by
silence
than
noise
and
the
sounds
that
break
that
silence
sink
deeper
and
more
durably
into
the
mind
i
have
a
more
present
and
lively
recollection
of
certain
scents
tastes
and
sounds
for
this
reason
than
i
have
of
mere
visible
images
because
they
are
more
original
and
less
worn
by
frequent
repetition
where
there
is
nothing
interposed
between
any
two
impressions
whatever
the
distance
of
time
that
parts
them
they
naturally
seem
to
touch
and
the
renewed
impression
recalls
the
former
one
in
full
force
without
distraction
or
competitor
the
taste
of
barberries
which
have
hung
out
in
the
snow
during
the
severity
of
a
north
american
winter
i
have
in
my
mouth
still
after
an
interval
of
thirty
years
for
i
have
met
with
no
other
taste
in
all
that
time
at
all
like
it
it
remains
by
itself
almost
like
the
impression
of
a
sixth
sense
but
the
colour
is
mixed
up
indiscriminately
with
the
colours
of
many
other
berries
nor
should
i
be
able
to
distinguish
it
among
them
the
smell
of
a
carries
the
evidence
of
its
own
identity
with
it
neither
is
it
to
me
from
peculiar
associations
unpleasant
the
colour
of
brickdust
on
the
contrary
is
more
common
and
easily
confounded
with
other
colours
raphael
did
not
keep
it
quite
distinct
from
his
flesh
colour
i
will
not
say
that
we
have
a
more
perfect
recollection
of
the
human
voice
than
of
that
complex
picture
the
human
face
but
i
think
the
sudden
hearing
of
a
voice
has
something
in
it
more
affecting
and
striking
than
the
sudden
meeting
with
the
face
perhaps
indeed
this
may
be
because
we
have
a
more
familiar
remembrance
of
the
one
than
the
other
and
the
voice
takes
us
more
by
surprise
on
that
account
i
am
by
no
means
certain
generally
speaking
that
we
have
the
ideas
of
the
other
senses
so
accurate
and
well
made
out
as
those
of
visible
form
what
i
chiefly
mean
is
that
the
feelings
belonging
to
the
sensations
of
our
other
organs
when
accidentally
recalled
are
kept
more
separate
and
pure
musical
sounds
probably
owe
a
good
deal
of
their
interest
and
romantic
effect
to
the
principle
here
spoken
of
were
they
constant
they
would
become
indifferent
as
we
may
find
with
respect
to
disagreeable
noises
which
we
do
not
hear
after
a
time
i
know
no
situation
more
pitiable
than
that
of
a
blind
fiddler
who
has
but
one
sense
left
if
we
except
the
sense
of
and
who
has
that
stunned
or
deafened
by
his
own
villainous
noises
shakespear
says
how
sound
lovers
tongues
by
night
it
has
been
observed
in
explanation
of
this
passage
that
it
is
because
in
the
lovers
are
occupied
with
one
another
faces
but
that
at
night
they
can
only
distinguish
the
sound
of
each
other
voices
i
know
not
how
this
may
be
but
i
have
ere
now
heard
a
voice
break
so
upon
the
silence
to
angels
was
most
like
and
charm
the
moonlight
air
with
its
balmy
essence
that
the
budding
leaves
trembled
to
its
accents
would
i
might
have
heard
it
once
more
whisper
peace
and
hope
as
erst
when
it
was
mingled
with
the
breath
of
spring
and
with
its
soft
pulsations
lift
winged
fancy
to
heaven
but
it
has
ceased
or
turned
where
i
no
more
shall
hear
it
hence
also
we
see
what
is
the
charm
of
the
shepherd
pastoral
reed
and
why
we
hear
him
as
it
were
piping
to
his
flock
even
in
a
picture
our
ears
are
fancy
stung
i
remember
once
strolling
along
the
margin
of
a
stream
skirted
with
willows
and
plashy
sedges
in
one
of
those
low
sheltered
valleys
on
salisbury
plain
where
the
monks
of
former
ages
had
planted
chapels
and
built
hermits
cells
there
was
a
little
parish
church
near
but
tall
elms
and
quivering
alders
hid
it
from
my
sight
when
all
of
a
sudden
i
was
startled
by
the
sound
of
the
full
organ
pealing
on
the
ear
accompanied
by
rustic
voices
and
the
willing
choir
of
village
maids
and
children
it
rose
indeed
an
exhalation
of
rich
distilled
perfumes
the
dew
from
a
thousand
pastures
was
gathered
in
its
softness
the
silence
of
a
thousand
years
spoke
in
it
it
came
upon
the
heart
like
the
calm
beauty
of
death
fancy
caught
the
sound
and
faith
mounted
on
it
to
the
skies
it
filled
the
valley
like
a
mist
and
still
poured
out
its
endless
chant
and
still
it
swells
upon
the
ear
and
wraps
me
in
a
golden
trance
drowning
the
noisy
tumult
of
the
world
there
is
a
curious
and
interesting
discussion
on
the
comparative
distinctness
of
our
visual
and
other
external
impressions
in
fearn
on
with
which
i
shall
try
to
descend
from
this
rhapsody
to
the
ground
of
common
sense
and
plain
reasoning
again
after
observing
a
little
before
that
is
more
untrue
than
that
sensations
of
vision
do
necessarily
leave
more
vivid
and
durable
ideas
than
those
of
grosser
senses
he
proceeds
to
give
a
number
of
illustrations
in
support
of
this
position
he
says
advantages
here
enumerated
in
favour
of
sight
i
think
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
man
will
come
to
forget
acquaintance
and
many
other
visible
objects
noticed
in
mature
age
before
he
will
in
the
least
forget
taste
and
smells
of
only
moderate
interest
encountered
either
in
his
childhood
or
at
any
time
since
the
course
of
voyaging
to
various
distant
regions
it
has
several
times
happened
that
i
have
eaten
once
or
twice
of
different
things
that
never
came
in
my
way
before
nor
since
some
of
these
have
been
pleasant
and
some
scarce
better
than
insipid
but
i
have
no
reason
to
think
i
have
forgot
or
much
altered
the
ideas
left
by
those
single
impulses
of
taste
though
here
the
memory
of
them
certainly
has
not
been
preserved
by
repetition
it
is
clear
i
must
have
seen
as
well
as
tasted
those
things
and
i
am
decided
that
i
remember
the
tastes
with
more
precision
than
i
do
the
visual
sensations
remember
having
once
and
only
once
eat
kangaroo
in
new
holland
and
having
once
smelled
a
baker
shop
having
a
peculiar
odour
in
the
city
of
bassorah
now
both
these
gross
ideas
remain
with
me
quite
as
vivid
as
any
visual
ideas
of
those
places
and
this
could
not
be
from
repetition
but
really
from
interest
in
the
sensation
years
ago
in
the
island
of
jamaica
i
partook
perhaps
twice
of
a
certain
fruit
of
the
taste
of
which
i
have
now
a
very
fresh
idea
and
i
could
add
other
instances
of
that
period
have
had
repeated
proofs
of
having
lost
retention
of
visual
objects
at
various
distances
of
time
though
they
had
once
been
familiar
i
have
not
during
thirty
years
forgot
the
delicate
and
in
itself
most
trifling
sensation
that
the
palm
of
my
hand
used
to
convey
when
i
was
a
boy
trying
the
different
effects
of
what
boys
call
and
tops
but
i
can
not
remember
within
several
shades
of
the
brown
coat
which
i
left
off
a
week
ago
if
any
man
thinks
he
can
do
better
let
him
take
an
ideal
survey
of
his
wardrobe
and
then
actually
refer
to
it
for
proof
retention
of
such
ideas
it
certainly
would
be
very
difficult
to
persuade
me
that
feeling
taste
and
smell
can
scarce
be
said
to
leave
ideas
unless
indistinct
and
obscure
ones
a
londoner
correct
models
of
twenty
london
churches
and
at
the
same
time
a
model
of
each
which
differs
in
several
considerable
features
from
the
truth
and
i
venture
to
say
he
shall
not
tell
you
in
any
instance
which
is
the
correct
one
except
by
mere
chance
he
is
an
architect
he
may
be
much
more
correct
than
any
ordinary
person
and
this
obviously
is
because
he
has
felt
an
interest
in
viewing
these
structures
which
an
ordinary
person
does
not
feel
and
here
interest
is
the
sole
reason
of
his
remembering
more
correctly
than
his
neighbour
once
heard
a
person
quaintly
ask
another
how
many
trees
there
are
in
paul
churchyard
the
question
itself
indicates
that
many
can
not
answer
it
and
this
is
found
to
be
the
case
with
those
who
have
passed
the
church
a
hundred
times
whilst
the
cause
is
that
every
individual
in
the
busy
stream
which
glides
past
paul
is
engrossed
in
various
other
interests
often
does
it
happen
that
we
enter
a
apartment
or
meet
a
friend
and
receive
some
vague
idea
of
visible
difference
but
can
not
possibly
find
out
it
is
until
at
length
we
come
to
perceive
or
perhaps
must
be
told
that
some
ornament
or
furniture
is
removed
altered
or
added
in
the
apartment
or
that
our
friend
has
cut
his
hair
taken
a
wig
or
has
made
any
of
twenty
considerable
alterations
in
his
appearance
at
other
times
we
have
no
perception
of
alteration
whatever
though
the
like
has
taken
place
is
however
certain
that
sight
apposited
with
interest
can
retain
tolerably
exact
copies
of
sensations
especially
if
not
too
complex
such
as
of
the
human
countenance
and
figure
yet
the
voice
will
convince
us
when
the
countenance
will
not
and
he
is
reckoned
an
excellent
painter
and
no
ordinary
genius
who
can
make
a
tolerable
likeness
from
memory
nay
more
it
is
a
conspicuous
proof
of
the
inaccuracy
of
visual
ideas
that
it
is
an
effort
of
consummate
art
attained
by
many
practice
to
take
a
strict
likeness
of
the
human
countenance
even
when
the
object
is
present
and
among
those
cases
where
the
wilful
cheat
of
flattery
has
been
avoided
we
still
find
in
how
very
few
instances
the
best
painters
produce
a
likeness
up
to
the
life
though
practice
and
interest
join
in
the
attempt
imagine
an
ordinary
person
would
find
it
very
difficult
supposing
he
had
some
knowledge
of
drawing
to
afford
from
memory
a
tolerable
sketch
of
such
a
familiar
object
as
his
curtain
his
carpet
or
his
if
the
pattern
of
either
be
at
all
various
or
irregular
yet
he
will
instantly
tell
with
precision
either
if
his
snuff
or
his
wine
has
not
the
same
character
it
had
yesterday
though
both
these
are
compounds
all
this
i
may
observe
that
a
draper
who
is
in
the
daily
habit
of
such
comparisons
can
not
carry
in
his
mind
the
particular
shade
of
a
colour
during
a
second
of
time
and
has
no
certainty
of
tolerably
matching
two
simple
colours
except
by
placing
the
patterns
in
contact
i
will
conclude
the
subject
of
this
essay
with
observing
that
as
it
appears
to
me
a
nearer
and
more
familiar
acquaintance
with
persons
has
a
different
and
more
favourable
effect
than
that
with
places
or
things
the
latter
improve
as
an
almost
universal
rule
by
being
removed
to
a
distance
the
former
generally
at
least
gain
by
being
brought
nearer
and
more
home
to
us
report
or
imagination
seldom
raises
any
individual
so
high
in
our
estimation
as
to
disappoint
us
greatly
when
we
are
introduced
to
him
prejudice
and
malice
constantly
exaggerate
defects
beyond
the
reality
ignorance
alone
makes
monsters
or
bugbears
our
actual
acquaintances
are
all
very
commonplace
people
the
thing
is
that
as
a
matter
of
hearsay
or
conjecture
we
make
abstractions
of
particular
vices
and
irritate
ourselves
against
some
particular
quality
or
action
of
the
person
we
dislike
whereas
individuals
are
concrete
existences
not
arbitrary
denominations
or
nicknames
and
have
innumerable
other
qualities
good
bad
and
indifferent
besides
the
damning
feature
with
which
we
fill
up
the
portrait
or
caricature
in
our
previous
fancies
we
can
scarcely
hate
any
one
that
we
know
an
acute
observer
complained
that
if
there
was
any
one
to
whom
he
had
a
particular
spite
and
a
wish
to
let
him
see
it
the
moment
he
came
to
sit
down
with
him
his
enmity
was
disarmed
by
some
unforeseen
circumstance
if
it
was
a
quarterly
reviewer
he
was
in
other
respects
like
any
other
man
suppose
again
your
adversary
turns
out
a
very
ugly
man
or
wants
an
eye
you
are
baulked
in
that
way
he
is
not
what
you
expected
the
object
of
your
abstract
hatred
and
implacable
disgust
he
may
be
a
very
disagreeable
person
but
he
is
no
longer
the
same
if
you
come
into
a
room
where
a
man
is
you
find
in
general
that
he
has
a
nose
upon
his
face
sympathy
this
alone
is
a
diversion
to
your
unqualified
contempt
he
is
stupid
and
says
nothing
but
he
seems
to
have
something
in
him
when
he
laughs
you
had
conceived
of
him
as
a
rank
whig
or
tory
yet
he
talks
upon
other
subjects
you
knew
that
he
was
a
virulent
but
you
find
that
the
man
himself
is
a
tame
sort
of
animal
enough
he
does
not
bite
that
something
in
short
you
can
make
nothing
of
it
even
opposite
vices
balance
one
another
a
man
may
be
pert
in
company
but
he
is
also
dull
so
that
you
can
not
though
you
try
hate
him
cordially
merely
for
the
wish
to
be
offensive
he
is
a
knave
you
learn
on
a
nearer
acquaintance
what
did
not
know
before
that
he
is
a
fool
as
well
so
you
forgive
him
on
the
other
hand
he
may
be
a
profligate
public
character
and
may
make
no
secret
of
it
but
he
gives
you
a
hearty
shake
by
the
hand
speaks
kindly
to
servants
and
supports
an
aged
father
and
mother
politics
apart
he
is
a
very
honest
fellow
you
are
told
that
a
person
has
carbuncles
on
his
face
but
you
have
ocular
proofs
that
he
is
sallow
and
pale
as
a
ghost
this
does
not
much
mend
the
matter
but
it
blunts
the
edge
of
the
ridicule
and
turns
your
indignation
against
the
inventor
of
the
lie
but
he
is
the
editor
of
a
scotch
magazine
so
you
are
just
where
you
were
i
am
not
very
fond
of
anonymous
criticism
i
want
to
know
who
the
author
can
be
but
the
moment
i
learn
this
i
am
satisfied
even
would
do
well
to
come
out
of
his
disguise
it
is
the
mask
only
that
we
dread
and
hate
the
man
may
have
something
human
about
hi
from
partial
representations
or
from
are
simple
uncompounded
ideas
which
answer
to
nothing
in
reality
those
which
we
derive
from
experience
are
mixed
modes
the
only
true
and
in
general
the
most
favourable
ones
instead
of
naked
deformity
or
abstract
perfection
those
faultless
monsters
which
the
world
saw
web
of
our
lives
is
of
mingled
yarn
good
and
ill
together
our
virtues
would
be
proud
if
our
faults
whipt
them
not
and
our
vices
would
despair
if
they
were
not
encouraged
by
our
virtues
this
was
truly
and
finely
said
long
ago
by
one
who
knew
the
strong
and
weak
points
of
human
nature
but
it
is
what
sects
and
parties
and
those
philosophers
whose
pride
and
boast
it
is
to
classify
by
nicknames
have
yet
to
know
the

in
consulting

interests
of

class
which

is

who

impracticable
dissatisfied

set
down
as
a
bad
member
of
the
community
in

as
no

to
regularity
and
order
as
pestilent
fellow
and
one
who
is
incapable
of
sympathy
attachment
or
cordial
in
any
department
or
undertaking
thus
the
most
refractory
novice
in
such
matters
becomes
weaned
from
his
obligations
to
the
larger
society
which
only
breed
him
inconvenience
without
any
adequate
recompense
and
wedded
to
a
nearer
and
dearer
one
where
he
finds
every
kind
of
comfort
and
consolation
he
contracts
the
vague
and
unmeaning
character
of
man
into
the
more
emphatic
title
of
freeman
and

the
claims
of
an
undefined
humanity
sit
looser
and
looser
upon
him
at
the

time
that
he
draws
the
bands
of

closer

tighter
about
him
he
loses
sight
by
degrees
of
all
common
sense
and
feeling
in
the
petty
squabbles
intrigues
feuds
and
airs
of
affected
importance
to
which
he
has
made
himself
an
accessory

is
quite
an
altered
man
the
society
were
under
considerable
obligations
to
him
in
that
last
business
that
is
to
say
in
some
paltry
job

underhand
attempt
to
encroach
upon
the
rights
or
dictate
to
the
understandings
of

they
eat
drink
and
carouse
together
they
wash
down
all
minor
animosities
and
unavoidable
differences
of
opinion
in
pint
bumpers
and
the
complaints
of
the
multitude
are
lost
in
the
clatter
of

and
the
roaring

at
every
quarter

or

feast
the
reels
with
an
unwieldy
sense
of
very
stones
prate
of
processions
the
common
pump
creaks
in
concert
with
the
uncorking
of
bottles
and
tapping
of
the
looks
big
with
authority
everything
has
an
ambiguous
upstart
repulsive
air
circle
within
circle
is
formed
an
in
and
the
business
is
to
exclude
from
the
first
circle
all
the
notions
opinions
ideas
interests
and
pretensions
of
the
second
hence
there
arises
not
only
an
antipathy
to
common
sense
and
decency
in
those
things
where
there
is
a
real
opposition
of
interest
or
clashing
of
prejudice
but
it
becomes
a
habit
and
a
favourite
amusement
in
those
who
are
in
a
little
brief
authority
to
thwart
annoy
insult
and
harass
others
on
all
occasions
where
the
least
opportunity
or
pretext
for
it
occurs
spite
bickerings
insinuations
lies
jealousies
nicknames
are
the
order

the

and
nobody
knows
what
it
all
about
one
would
think
that
the

aldermen

liverymen
were
a
higher

more
select
species
of
animals
than
their
townsmen
though
there
is
no

whatever

in

off

of
nature
are
effectually
guarded
against
indeed
by
the
very
rules
and
regulations
of
the
society
as
well
as
by
its
spirit
the
individual
is
the
creature
of
his
feelings
of
all
sorts
the
sport
of
his
vices
and
his
virtues
like
the
fool
in
shakespear
his
proper

corporate
bodies
are
dressed
in
a
moral
uniform
mixed
motives
do
not
operate
there
frailty
is
made
into

are
turned
into
commodities
only
so
much
of
any
one
natural
or
genuine
impulses
can
influence
him
in
his
artificial
capacity
as
formally
comes
home
to

conscience
of

he
acts

real

the
importance
respectability
and
professed
objects
of
the
society
beyond
that
point
the
nerve
is
bound
up
the
conscience
is
seared
and
the
of
so
much
inert
matter
operates
to
deaden
the
best
feelings
and
harden
the
heart
laughter
and
tears
are
said
to
be
the
characteristic
signs
of
humanity
laughter
is
common
enough
in
such
places
as
a
to
the
but
who
ever
saw
a
public
body
in
tears
nothing
but
a
job
or
some
knavery
can
keep
them
serious
for
ten
minutes
together
such
are
the
qualifications
and
the
apprenticeship
necessary
to
make
a
man
tolerated
to
enable
him
to
pass
as
a
cypher
or
be
admitted
as
a
mere
numerical
unit
in
any
corporate
body
to
be
a
leader
and
dictator
he
must
be
diplomatic
in
impertinence
and
officious
in
every
dirty
work
he
must
not
merely
conform
to
established
prejudices
he
must
flatter
them
he
must
not
merely
be
insensible
to
the
demands
of
moderation
and
equity
he
must
be
loud
against
them
he
must
not
simply
fall
in
with
all
sorts
of
contemptible
cabals
and
intrigues
he
must
be
indefatigable
in
fomenting
them
and
setting
everybody
together
by
the
ears
he
must
not
only
repeat
but
invent
lies
he
must
make
speeches
and
write
handbills
he
must
be
devoted
to
the
wishes
and
objects
of
the
society
its
creature
its
jackal
its
busybody
its
mouthpiece
its
prompter
he
must
deal
in
law
cases
in
demurrers
in
charters
in
traditions
in
in
logic
and
rhetoric
in
everything
but
common
sense
and
honesty
he
must
in
burke
phrase
himself
of
his
natural
entrails
and
be
stuffed
with
paltry
blurred
sheets
of
parchment
about
the
rights
of
the
privileged
few
he
must
be
a
concentrated
essence
a
varnished
powdered
representative
of
the
vices
absurdities
hypocrisy
jealousy
pride
and
pragmaticalness
of
his
party
such
a
one
by
bustle
and
and
puffing
by
flattering
one
to
his
face
and
abusing
another
behind
his
back
by
lending
himself
to
the
weaknesses
of
some
and
pampering
the
mischievous
propensities
of
others
will
pass
for
a
great
man
in
a
little
society
age
does
not
improve
the
morality
of
public
bodies
they
grow
more
and
more
tenacious
of
their
idle
privileges
and
senseless
they
get
weak
and
obstinate
at
the
same
time
those
who
belong
to
them
have
all
the
upstart
pride
and
pettifogging
spirit
of
their
present
character
ingrafted
on
the
venerableness
and
superstitious
sanctity
of
ancient
institutions
they
are
naturally
at
issue
first
with
their
neighbours
and
next
with
their
contemporaries
on
all
matters
of
common
propriety
and
judgment
they
become
more
attached
to
forms
the
more
obsolete
they
are
and
the
defence
of
every
absurd
and
invidious
distinction
is
a
debt
which
by
implication
they
owe
to
the
dead
as
well
as
the
living
what
might
once
have
been
of
serious
practical
utility
they
turn
to
farce
by
retaining
the
letter
when
the
spirit
is
gone
and
they
do
this
the
more
the
more
glaring
the
inconsistency
and
want
of
sound
reasoning
for
they
think
they
thus
give
proof
of
their
zeal
and
attachment
to
the
abstract
principle
on
which
old
establishments
exist
the
ground
of
prescription
and
authority
greater
the
wrong
the
greater
the
right
in
all
such
cases
the
de
does
not
take
much
merit
to
itself
for
upholding
what
is
justifiable
in
any
system
or
the
proceedings
of
any
party
but
for
adhering
to
what
is
palpably
injurious
you
may
exact
the
first
from
an
enemy
the
last
is
the
province
of
a
friend
it
has
been
made
a
subject
of
complaint
that
the
champions
of
the
church
for
example
who
are
advanced
to
dignities
and
honours
are
hardly
ever
those
who
defend
the
common
principles
of
christianity
but
those
who
volunteer
to
man
the
and
set
up
ingenious
excuses
for
the
questionable
points
the
ticklish
places
in
the
established
form
of
worship
that
is
for
those
which
are
attacked
from
without
and
are
supposed
in
danger
of
being
undermined
by
stratagem
or
carried
by
assault
the
great
resorts
and
seats
of
learning
often
outlive
in
this
way
the
intention
of
the
founders
as
the
world
outgrows
them
they
may
be
said
to
resemble
antiquated
coquettes
of
the
last
age
who
think
everything
ridiculous
and
intolerable
but
what
was
in
fashion
when
they
were
young
and
yet
are
standing
proofs
of
the
progress
of
taste
and
the
vanity
of
human
pretensions
our
universities
are
in
a
great
measure
become
cisterns
to
hold
not
conduits
to
disperse
knowledge
the
age
has
the
start
of
them
that
is
other
sources
of
knowledge
have
been
opened
since
their
formation
to
which
the
world
have
had
access
and
have
drunk
plentifully
at
those
living
fountains
but
from
which
they
are
debarred
by
the
tenor
of
their
charter
and
as
a
matter
of
dignity
and
privilege
they
have
grown
poor
like
the
old
grandees
in
some
countries
by
subsisting
on
the
inheritance
of
learning
while
the
people
have
grown
rich
by
trade
they
are
too
much
in
the
nature
of
in
intellect
they
stop
the
way
in
the
road
to
truth
or
at
any
rate
for
they
do
not
themselves
advance
they
can
only
be
of
service
as
a
on
the
too
hasty
and
rapid
career
of
innovation
all
that
has
been
invented
or
thought
in
the
last
two
hundred
years
they
take
no
cognizance
of
or
as
little
as
possible
they
are
above
it
they
stand
upon
the
ancient
landmarks
and
will
not
budge
whatever
was
not
known
when
they
were
first
endowed
they
are
still
in
profound
and
lofty
ignorance
of
yet
in
that
period
how
much
has
been
done
in
literature
arts
and
science
of
which
with
the
exception
of
mathematical
knowledge
the
hardest
to
gainsay
or
subject
to
the
trammels
of
prejudice
and
barbarous
scarce
any
trace
is
to
be
found
in
the
authentic
modes
of
study
and
legitimate
inquiry
which
prevail
at
either
of
our
universities
the
unavoidable
aim
of
all
corporate
bodies
of
learning
is
not
to
grow
wise
or
teach
others
wisdom
but
to
prevent
any
one
else
from
being
or
seeming
wiser
than
themselves
in
other
words
their
infallible
tendency
is
in
the
end
to
suppress
inquiry
and
darken
knowledge
by
setting
limits
to
the
mind
of
man
and
saying
to
his
proud
spirit
shalt
thou
come
and
no
farther
it
would
not
be
an
unedifying
experiment
to
make
a
collection
of
the
titles
of
works
published
in
the
course
of
the
year
by
members
of
the
universities
if
any
attempt
is
to
be
made
to
patch
up
an
idle
system
in
policy
or
legislation
or
church
government
it
is
by
a
member
of
the
university
if
any
speculation
on
an
old
exploded
argument
is
to
be
brought
forward
spite
of
in
erring
reason
spite
it
is
by
a
member
of
the
university
if
a
paltry
project
is
ushered
into
the
world
for
combining
ancient
prejudices
with
modern
it
is
by
a
member
of
the
university
thus
we
get
at
a
stated
supply
of
the
annual
defences
of
the
sinking
fund
thoughts
on
the
evils
of
education
treatises
on
predestination
and
eulogies
on
malthus
all
from
the
same
source
and
through
the
same
vent
if
they
came
from
any
other
quarter
nobody
would
look
at
them
but
they
have
an
from
dulness
and
authority
we
know
that
there
is
no
offence
in
them
and
they
are
stuck
in
the
shop
windows
and
read
in
the
intervals
of
lord
byron
works
or
the
scotch
novels
in
cathedral
towns
and
close
boroughs
it
is
i
understand
and
believe
pretty
much
the
same
in
more
modern
institutions
for
the
encouragement
of
the
fine
arts
the
end
is
lost
in
the
means
rules
take
place
of
nature
and
genius
cabal
and
bustle
and
struggle
for
rank
and
precedence
supersede
the
study
and
the
love
of
art
a
royal
academy
is
a
kind
of
hospital
and
infirmary
for
the
obliquities
of
taste
and
ingenuity
a
receptacle
where
enthusiasm
and
originality
stop
and
stagnate
and
spread
their
influence
no
farther
instead
of
being
a
school
founded
for
genius
or
a
temple
built
to
fame
the
generality
of
those
who
wriggle
or
fawn
or
beg
their
way
to
a
seat
there
live
on
their
certificate
of
merit
to
a
good
old
age
and
are
seldom
heard
of
afterwards
if
a
man
of
sterling
capacity
gets
among
them
and
minds
his
own
business
he
is
nobody
he
makes
no
figure
in
council
in
voting
in
resolutions
or
speeches
if
he
comes
forward
with
plans
and
views
for
the
good
of
the
academy
and
the
advancement
of
art
he
is
immediately
set
upon
as
a
visionary
a
fanatic
with
notions
hostile
to
the
interest
and
credit
of
the
existing
members
of
the
society
if
he
directs
the
ambition
of
the
scholars
to
the
study
of
history
this
strikes
at
once
at
the
emoluments
of
the
profession
who
are
most
of
them
by
god
will
portrait
painters
if
he
eulogises
the
antique
and
speaks
highly
of
the
old
masters
he
is
supposed
to
be
actuated
by
envy
to
living
painters
and
native
talent
if
again
he
insists
on
a
knowledge
of
anatomy
as
essential
to
correct
drawing
this
would
seem
to
imply
a
want
of
it
in
our
most
eminent
designers
every
plan
suggestion
argument
that
has
the
general
purposes
and
principles
of
art
for
its
object
is
thwarted
scouted
ridiculed
slandered
as
having
a
malignant
aspect
towards
the
profits
and
pretensions
of
the
great
mass
of
flourishing
and
respectable
artists
in
the
country
this
leads
to
irritation
and
on
all
sides
the
obstinacy
of
the
constituted
authorities
keeps
pace
with
the
violence
and
extravagance
opposed
to
it
and
they
lay
all
the
blame
on
the
folly
and
mistakes
they
have
themselves
occasioned
or
increased
it
is
considered
as
a
personal
quarrel
not
a
public
question
by
which
means
the
dignity
of
the
body
is
implicated
in
resenting
the
slips
and
inadvertencies
of
its
members
not
in
promoting
their
common
and
declared
objects
in
this
sort
of
wretched
the
barrys
and
h
s
stand
no
chance
with
the
catons
the
tubbs
and
f
sir
joshua
even
was
obliged
to
hold
himself
aloof
from
them
and
fuseli
passes
as
a
kind
of
nondescript
or
one
of
his
own
grotesques
the
air
of
an
academy
in
short
is
not
the
air
of
genius
and
immortality
it
is
too
close
and
heated
and
impregnated
with
the
notions
of
the
common
sort
a
man
steeped
in
a
corrupt
atmosphere
of
this
description
is
no
longer
open
to
the
genial
impulses
of
nature
and
truth
nor
sees
visions
of
ideal
beauty
nor
dreams
of
antique
grace
and
grandeur
nor
has
the
finest
works
of
art
continually
hovering
and
floating
through
his
uplifted
fancy
but
the
images
that
haunt
it
are
rules
of
the
academy
charters
inaugural
speeches
resolutions
passed
or
rescinded
cards
of
invitation
to
a
or
the
annual
dinner
prize
medals
and
the
diploma
constituting
him
a
gentleman
and
esquire
he
out
all
trivial
fond
records
all
romantic
aspirations
raphael
grace
the
guido
air
and
the
commands
of
the
academy
alone
live
within
the
book
and
volume
of
his
brain
unmixed
with
baser
matter
it
may
be
doubted
whether
any
work
of
lasting
reputation
and
universal
interest
can
spring
up
in
this
soil
or
ever
has
done
in
that
of
any
academy
the
last
question
is
a
matter
of
fact
and
history
not
of
mere
opinion
or
prejudice
and
may
be
ascertained
as
such
accordingly
the
mighty
names
of
former
times
rose
before
the
existence
of
academies
and
the
three
greatest
painters
undoubtedly
that
this
country
has
produced
reynolds
wilson
and
hogarth
were
not
and
swaddled
into
artists
in
any
institution
for
the
fine
arts
i
do
not
apprehend
that
the
names
of
chantrey
or
wilkie
great
as
one
and
considerable
as
the
other
of
them
is
can
be
made
use
of
in
any
way
to
impugn
the
jet
of
this
argument
we
may
find
a
considerable
improvement
in
some
of
our
artists
when
they
get
out
of
the
vortex
for
a
time
sir
thomas
lawrence
is
all
the
better
for
having
been
abstracted
for
a
year
or
two
from
somerset
house
and
dawe
they
say
has
been
doing
wonders
in
the
north
when
will
he
return
and
once
more
britannia
rival
greece
canning
somewhere
lays
it
down
as
a
rule
that
corporate
bodies
are
necessarily
correct
and
pure
in
their
conduct
from
the
knowledge
which
the
individuals
composing
them
have
of
one
another
and
the
jealous
vigilance
they
exercise
over
each
other
motives
and
characters
whereas
people
collected
into
mobs
are
disorderly
and
unprincipled
from
being
utterly
unknown
and
unaccountable
to
each
other
this
is
a
curious
of
wit
i
differ
with
him
in
both
parts
of
the
dilemma
to
begin
with
the
first
and
to
handle
it
somewhat
cavalierly
according
to
the
model
before
us
we
know
for
instance
there
is
said
to
be
honour
among
thieves
but
very
little
honesty
towards
others
their
honour
consists
in
the
division
of
the
booty
not
in
the
mode
of
acquiring
it
they
do
not
often
betray
one
another
but
they
will
waylay
a
stranger
or
knock
out
a
traveller
brains
they
may
be
depended
on
in
giving
the
alarm
when
any
of
their
posts
are
in
danger
of
being
surprised
and
they
will
stand
together
for
their
gains
to
the
last
drop
of
their
blood
yet
they
form
a
distinct
society
and
are
strictly
responsible
for
their
behaviour
to
one
another
and
to
their
leader
they
are
not
a
mob
but
a
completely
in
one
another
power
and
secrets
their
familiarity
however
with
the
proceedings
of
the
does
not
lead
them
to
expect
or
to
exact
from
it
a
very
high
standard
of
moral
honesty
that
is
out
of
the
question
but
they
are
sure
to
gain
the
good
opinion
of
their
fellows
by
committing
all
sorts
of
depredations
fraud
and
violence
against
the
community
at
large
so
not
to
speak
it
profanely
some
of
croker
friends
may
be
very
respectable
people
in
their
way
honourable
men
but
their
respectability
is
confined
within
party
limits
every
one
does
not
sympathise
in
the
integrity
of
their
views
the
understanding
between
them
and
the
public
is
not
well
defined
or
reciprocal
or
suppose
a
gang
of
pickpockets
hustle
a
passenger
in
the
street
and
the
mob
set
upon
them
and
proceed
to
execute
summary
justice
upon
such
as
they
can
lay
hands
on
am
i
to
conclude
that
the
rogues
are
in
the
right
because
theirs
is
a
system
of
knavery
which
they
settled
in
the
morning
with
their
eyes
one
upon
the
other
and
which
they
regularly
review
at
night
with
a
due
estimate
of
each
other
motives
character
and
conduct
in
the
business
and
that
the
honest
men
are
in
the
wrong
because
they
are
a
casual
collection
of
unprejudiced
disinterested
individuals
taken
at
a
venture
from
the
mass
of
the
people
acting
without
concert
or
responsibility
on
the
spur
of
the
occasion
and
giving
way
to
their
instantaneous
impulses
and
honest
anger
mobs
in
fact
then
are
almost
always
right
in
their
feelings
and
often
in
their
judgments
on
this
very
account
that
being
utterly
unknown
to
and
disconnected
with
each
other
they
have
no
point
of
union
or
principle
of
between
them
but
the
natural
sense
of
justice
recognised
by
all
persons
in
common
they
appeal
at
the

essay
xii
whether
actors
ought
to
sit
in
the
boxes
i
think
not
and
that
for
the
following
reasons
as
well
as
i
can
give
them
actors
belong
to
the
public
their
persons
are
not
their
own
property
they
exhibit
themselves
on
the
stage
that
is
enough
without
displaying
themselves
in
the
boxes
of
the
theatre
i
conceive
that
an
actor
on
account
of
the
very
circumstances
of
his
profession
ought
to
keep
himself
as
much
incognito
as
possible
he
plays
a
number
of
parts
disguised
transformed
into
them
as
much
as
he
can
his
so
potent
art
and
he
should
not
disturb
this
borrowed
impression
by
unmasking
before
company
more
than
he
can
help
let
him
go
into
the
pit
if
he
pleases
to
see
not
into
the
first
circle
to
be
seen
he
is
seen
enough
without
that
he
is
the
centre
of
an
illusion
that
he
is
bound
to
support
both
as
it
appears
to
me
by
a
certain
which
should
repel
idle
curiosity
and
by
a
certain
deference
to
the
public
in
whom
he
has
inspired
certain
prejudices
which
he
is
covenanted
not
to
break
he
represents
the
majesty
of
successive
kings
he
takes
the
responsibility
of
heroes
and
lovers
on
himself
the
mantle
of
genius
and
nature
falls
on
his
shoulders
we
millions
of
associations
on
him
under
which
he
should
be
quick
and
not
perk
out
an
inauspicious
face
upon
us
with
a
coat
to
say
fools
you
all
were
i
am
not
hamlet
the
dane
it
is
very
well
and
in
strict
propriety
for
mathews
in
his
at
home
after
he
has
been
imitating
his
inimitable
scotchwoman
to
slip
out
as
quick
as
lightning
and
appear
in
the
shaking
hands
with
our
old
friend
jack
bannister
it
adds
to
our
surprise
at
the
versatility
of
his
changes
of
place
and
appearance
and
he
had
been
before
us
in
his
own
person
during
a
great
part
of
the
evening
there
was
no
harm
done
no
imaginary
spell
broken
no
discontinuity
of
thought
or
sentiment
mathews
is
himself
without
offence
be
it
spoken
both
a
cleverer
and
more
respectable
man
than
many
of
the
characters
he
represents
not
so
when
the
stage
the
ghost
of
hamlet
stalks
othello
rages
desdemona
mourns
and
poor
monimia
pours
her
soul
in
love
a
different
feeling
then
prevails
close
close
the
scene
upon
them
and
never
break
that
fine
phantasmagoria
of
the
brain
or
if
it
must
be
done
at
all
let
us
choose
some
other
time
and
place
for
it
let
no
one
wantonly
dash
the
cirecan
cup
from
our
lips
or
dissolve
the
spirit
of
enchantment
in
the
very
palace
of
enchantment
go
and
sit
somewhere
else
what
a
thing
it
is
for
instance
for
any
part
of
an
actor
dress
to
come
off
unexpectedly
while
he
is
playing
what
a
it
is
upon
himself
and
the
audience
what
an
effort
he
has
to
recover
himself
and
struggle
through
this
exposure
of
the
naked
truth
it
has
been
considered
as
one
of
the
triumphs
of
garrick
tragic
power
that
once
when
he
was
playing
lear
his
crown
of
straw
came
off
and
nobody
laughed
or
took
the
least
notice
so
much
had
he
identified
himself
with
the
character
was
he
after
this
to
pay
so
little
respect
to
the
feelings
he
had
inspired
as
to
tear
off
his
tattered
robes
and
take
the
old
crazed
king
with
him
to
play
the
fool
in
the
boxes
no
let
him
pass
vex
not
his
parting
spirit
nor
on
the
rack
of
this
rough
world
stretch
him
out
farther
some
lady
is
said
to
have
fallen
in
love
with
garrick
from
being
present
when
he
played
the
part
of
romeo
on
which
he
observed
that
he
would
undertake
to
cure
her
of
her
folly
if
she
would
only
come
and
see
him
in
abel
drugger
so
the
modern
tragedian
and
fine
gentleman
by
appearing
to
advantage
and
conspicuously
propria
persona
may
easily
cure
us
of
our
predilection
for
all
the
principal
characters
he
shines
in
do
you
think
alexander
looked
o
this
fashion
in
his
lifetime
or
was
perfumed
so
had
julius
caesar
such
a
nose
or
wore
his
frill
as
you
do
you
have
slain
i
do
know
how
many
heroes
with
a
bare
bodkin
the
gold
pin
in
your
shirt
and
spoiled
all
the
fine
love
speeches
you
will
ever
make
by
picking
your
teeth
with
that
inimitable
air
an
actor
after
having
performed
his
part
well
instead
of
courting
farther
distinction
should
affect
obscurity
and
most
away
conscious
of
admiration
that
he
can
support
nowhere
but
in
his
proper
sphere
and
jealous
of
his
own
and
others
good
opinion
of
him
in
proportion
as
he
is
a
darling
in
the
public
eye
he
can
not
avoid
attracting
disproportionate
attention
why
should
he
wish
to
fix
it
on
himself
in
a
perfectly
flat
and
insignificant
part
viz
his
own
character
it
was
a
bad
custom
to
bring
authors
on
the
stage
to
crown
them
ignotum
pro
magnifico
even
professed
critics
i
think
should
be
shy
of
putting
themselves
forward
to
applaud
loudly
any
one
in
a
crowd
has
voice
potential
as
the
press
it
is
either
committing
their
pretensions
a
little
indiscreetly
or
confirming
their
own
judgment
by
a
clapping
of
hands
if
you
only
go
and
give
the
cue
lustily
the
house
seems
in
wonderful
accord
with
your
opinions
an
actor
like
a
king
should
only
appear
on
state
occasions
he
loses
popularity
by
too
much
publicity
or
according
to
the
proverb
breeds
both
characters
personate
a
certain
abstract
idea
are
seen
in
a
fictitious
costume
and
when
they
have
off
this
more
than
mortal
coil
they
had
better
keep
out
of
the
way
the
acts
and
sentiments
emanating
from
themselves
will
not
carry
on
the
illusion
of
our
prepossessions
ordinary
transactions
do
not
give
scope
to
grace
and
dignity
like
romantic
situations
or
prepared
pageants
and
the
is
apt
to
prevail
over
the
if
we
come
to
count
the
instances
the
motto
of
a
great
actor
should
be
caesar
aut
i
do
not
see
how
with
his
crown
or
plume
of
feathers
he
can
get
through
those
little
without
stooping
and
squeezing
his
artificial
importance
to
tatters
the
entrance
of
the
stage
is
arched
so
high
may
get
through
and
keep
their
gorgeous
turbans
on
without
to
the
gods
the
of
the
day
has
too
large
and
splendid
a
train
following
him
to
have
room
for
them
in
one
of
the
when
he
appears
there
it
should
be
enlarged
expressly
for
the
occasion
for
at
his
heels
march
the
figures
in
full
costume
of
cato
and
brutus
and
cassius
and
of
him
with
the
falcon
eye
and
othello
and
lear
and
richard
and
hamlet
prince
of
denmark
and
numbers
more
and
demand
entrance
along
with
him
shadows
to
which
he
alone
lends
bodily
substance
graves
yawn
and
render
up
their
dead
to
push
us
from
our
stools
there
is
a
mighty
bustle
at
the
door
a
gibbering
and
squeaking
in
the
lobbies
an
actor
retinue
is
imperial
it
presses
upon
the
imagination
too
much
and
he
should
therefore
slide
unnoticed
into
the
pit
authors
who
are
in
a
manner
his
makers
and
masters
sit
there
contented
why
should
not
he
is
used
to
show
himself
that
then
is
the
very
reason
he
should
conceal
his
person
at
other
times
a
habit
of
ostentation
should
not
be
reduced
to
a
principle
if
i
had
seen
the
late
gentleman
lewis
fluttering
in
a
prominent
situation
in
the
boxes
i
should
have
been
puzzled
whether
to
think
of
him
as
the
copper
captain
or
as
bobadil
or
ranger
or
young
rapid
or
lord
foppington
or
fifty
other
whimsical
characters
then
i
should
have
got
munden
and
quick
and
a
parcel
more
of
them
in
my
head
till
brain
would
have
been
like
a
i
should
not
have
known
what
to
make
of
it
but
if
i
had
seen
him
in
the
pit
i
should
merely
have
eyed
him
with
respectful
curiosity
and
have
told
every
one
that
that
was
gentleman
lewis
we
should
have
concluded
from
the
circumstance
that
he
was
a
modest
sensible
man
we
all
knew
beforehand
that
he
could
show
off
whenever
he
pleased
there
is
one
class
of
performers
that
i
think
is
quite
exempt
from
the
foregoing
reasoning
i
mean
come
when
they
will
and
where
they
will
they
are
welcome
to
their
old
friends
they
have
as
good
a
right
to
sit
in
the
boxes
as
children
at
the
holidays
but
they
do
not
somehow
come
often
it
is
but
a
melancholy
recollection
with
them
then
sweet
now
sad
to
think
on
garrick
still
goes
often
and
hears
the
applause
of
her
husband
over
again
in
the
shouts
of
the
pit
had
pritchard
or
clive
been
living
i
am
afraid
we
should
have
seen
little
of
would
have
been
too
a
feeling
with
them
siddons
seldom
if
ever
goes
and
yet
she
is
almost
the
only
thing
left
worth
seeing
there
she
need
not
stay
away
on
account
of
any
theory
that
i
can
form
she
is
out
of
the
pale
of
all
theories
and
annihilates
all
rules
wherever
she
sits
there
is
grace
and
grandeur
there
is
tragedy
personified
her
seat
is
the
undivided
throne
of
the
tragic
muse
she
had
no
need
of
the
robes
the
sweeping
train
the
ornaments
of
the
stage
in
herself
she
is
as
great
as
any
being
she
ever
represented
in
the
ripeness
and
plenitude
of
her
power
i
should
not
i
confess
have
had
the
same
paramount
abstracted
feeling
at
seeing
john
kemble
there
whom
i
venerate
at
a
distance
and
should
not
have
known
whether
he
was
playing
off
the
great
man
or
the
great
actor
a
little
more
than
kin
and
less
than
kind
i
know
it
may
be
said
in
answer
to
all
this
pretext
of
keeping
the
character
of
the
player
inviolate
is
there
more
common
in
fact
than
for
the
hero
of
a
tragedy
to
speak
the
prologue
or
than
for
the
heroine
who
has
been
stabbed
or
poisoned
to
revive
and
come
forward
laughing
in
the
epilogue
as
to
the
epilogue
it
is
spoken
to
get
rid
of
the
idea
of
the
tragedy
altogether
and
to
ward
off
the
fury
of
the
pit
who
may
be
bent
on
its
damnation
the
greatest
incongruity
you
can
hit
upon
is
therefore
the
most
proper
for
this
purpose
but
i
deny
that
the
hero
of
a
tragedy
or
the
principal
character
in
it
is
ever
pitched
upon
to
deliver
the
prologue
it
is
always
by
prescription
some
walking
shadow
some
poor
player
who
can
not
even
spoil
a
part
of
any
consequence
is
there
not
claremont
always
at
hand
for
this
purpose
whom
the
late
king
pronounced
three
times
to
be
bad
actor
what
is
there
in
common
between
that
accustomed
wave
of
the
hand
and
the
cocked
hat
under
the
arm
and
any
passion
or
person
that
can
be
brought
forward
on
the
stage
it
is
not
that
we
can
be
said
to
acquire
a
prejudice
against
so
harmless
an
actor
as
claremont
we
are
born
with
a
prejudice
against
a
speaker
of
prologues
it
is
an
innate
idea
a
natural
instinct
there
is
a
particular
organ
in
the
brain
provided
for
it
do
we
not
all
hate
a
manager
it
is
not
because
he
is
insolent
or
impertinent
or
fond
of
making
ridiculous
speeches
or
a
notorious
puffer
or
ignorant
or
mean
or
vain
but
it
is
because
we
see
him
in
a
coat
waistcoat
and
breeches
the
stage
is
the
world
of
fantasy
it
is
queen
mab
that
has
invited
us
to
her
revels
there
and
all
that
have
to
do
with
it
should
wear
motley
lastly
there
are
some
actors
by
profession
whose
faces
we
like
to
see
in
the
boxes
or
anywhere
else
but
it
is
because
they
are
no
actors
but
rather
gentlemen
and
scholars
and
in
their
proper
places
in
the
boxes
or
wherever
they
are
does
not
an
actor
himself
i
would
ask
feel
conscious
and
awkward
in
the
boxes
if
he
thinks
that
he
is
known
and
does
he
not
sit
there
in
spite
of
this
uneasy
feeling
and
run
the
gauntlet
of
impertinent
looks
and
whispers
only
to
get
a
little
as
he
thinks
it
is
hardly
to
be
supposed
that
he
comes
to
see
the
play
the
show
he
must
have
enough
of
plays
and
finery
but
he
wants
to
see
a
favourite
perhaps
a
rival
actor
in
a
striking
part
then
the
place
for
him
to
do
this
is
the
pit
painters
i
know
always
get
as
close
up
to
a
picture
they
want
to
copy
as
they
can
and
i
should
imagine
actors
would
want
to
do
the
same
in
order
to
look
into
the
texture
and
mechanism
of
their
art
even
theatrical
critics
can
make
nothing
of
a
part
that
they
see
from
the
boxes
if
you
sit
in
the
your
attention
is
drawn
off
by
the
company
and
other
circumstances
if
you
get
to
a
distance
so
as
to
be
out
of
the
reach
of
notice
you
can
neither
hear
nor
see
well
for
myself
i
would
as
soon
take
a
seat
on
the
top
of
the
monument
to
give
an
account
of
a
first
appearance
as
go
into
the
second
or
third
tier
of
boxes
to
do
it
i
went
but
the
other
day
with
a
to
see
miss
fanny
brunton
come
out
in
juliet
and
macready
make
a
first
appearance
in
romeo
and
though
i
was
told
by
a
tolerable
judge
that
the
new
juliet
was
the
most
elegant
figure
on
the
stage
and
that
macready
romeo
was
quite
beautiful
i
vow
to
god
i
knew
nothing
of
it
so
little
could
i
tell
of
the
matter
that
at
one
time
i
mistook
horrebow
for
abbott
i
have
seen
kean
play
sir
giles
overreach
one
night
from
the
front
of
the
pit
and
a
few
nights
after
from
the
front
boxes
facing
the
stage
it
was
another
thing
altogether
that
which
had
been
so
lately
nothing
but
flesh
and
blood
a
living
fibre
with
fire
and
spirit
was
no
better
than
a
little
fantoccini
figure
darting
backwards
and
forwards
on
the
stage
starting
screaming
and
playing
a
number
of
fantastic
tricks
before
the
audience
i
could
account
in
the
latter
instance
for
the
little
approbation
of
the
performance
manifested
around
me
and
also
for
the
general
scepticism
with
respect
to
kean
acting
which
has
been
said
to
prevail
among
those
who
can
not
condescend
to
go
into
the
pit
and
have
not
interest
in
the
orchestra
to
see
him
act
they
may
then
stay
away
altogether
his
face
is
the
running
comment
on
his
acting
which
reconciles
the
audience
to
it
without
that
index
to
his
mind
you
are
not
prepared
for
the
vehemence
and
suddenness
of
his
gestures
his
pauses
are
long
abrupt
and
unaccountable
if
not
filled
up
by
the
expression
it
is
in
the
working
of
his
face
that
you
see
the
writhing
and
coiling
up
of
the
passions
before
they
make
their
the
lightning
of
his
eye
precedes
the
hoarse
burst
of
thunder
from
his
voice
one
may
go
into
the
boxes
indeed
and
criticise
acting
and
actors
with
sterne
but
not
otherwise
and
between
the
nominative
case
and
the
verb
which
as
your
lordship
knows
should
agree
together
in
number
person
etc
there
was
a
full
pause
of
a
second
and
but
was
the
eye
silent
did
the
look
say
nothing
i
looked
only
at
the
my
lord
excellent
critic
if
any
other
actor
indeed
goes
to
see
kean
act
with
a
view
avoid
imitation
this
may
be
the
place
or
rather
it
is
the
way
to
run
into
it
for
you
see
only
his
extravagances
and
defects
which
are
the
most
easily
carried
away
mathews
may
translate
him
into
an
at
home
even
from
the
distinguished
actors
then
ought
i
conceive
to
set
the
example
of
going
into
the
pit
were
it
only
for
their
own
sakes
i
remember
a
trifling
circumstance
which
i
worked
up
at
the
time
into
a
confirmation
of
this
theory
of
mine
engrafted
on
old
prejudice
and
tradition
i
had
got
into
the
middle
of
the
pit
at
considerable
risk
of
broken
bones
to
see
kean
in
one
of
his
early
parts
when
i
perceived
two
young
men
seated
a
little
behind
me
with
a
certain
space
left
round
them
they
were
dressed
in
the
height
of
the
fashion
in
light
greatcoats
and
with
their
drawn
down
over
their
hands
at
a
time
when
this
was
not
so
common
as
it
has
since
become
i
took
them
for
younger
sons
of
some
old
family
at
least
one
of
them
that
was
very
i
thought
might
be
lord
byron
and
his
companion
might
be
hobhouse
they
seemed
to
have
wandered
from
another
sphere
of
this
our
planet
to
witness
a
masterly
performance
to
the
utmost
advantage
this
stamped
the
thing
they
were
undoubtedly
young
men
of
rank
and
fashion
but
their
taste
was
greater
than
their
regard
for
appearances
the
pit
was
after
all
the
true
resort
of
thoroughbred
critics
and
amateurs
when
there
was
anything
worth
seeing
this
was
the
place
and
i
began
to
feel
a
sort
of
reflected
importance
in
the
consciousness
that
i
also
was
a
critic
nobody
sat
near
them
it
would
have
seemed
like
an
intrusion
not
a
syllable
was
they
were
two
clerks
in
the
victualling
office
what
i
would
insist
on
then
is
this
that
for
kean
or
young
or
macready
or
any
of
those
that
are
out
upon
in
the
top
of
the
compass
to
obtrude
themselves
voluntarily
or
ostentatiously
upon
our
notice
when
they
are
out
of
character
is
a
solecism
in
theatricals
for
them
to
thrust
themselves
forward
before
the
scenes
is
to
drag
us
behind
them
against
our
will
than
which
nothing
can
be
more
fatal
to
a
true
passion
for
the
stage
and
which
is
a
privilege
that
should
be
kept
sacred
for
impertinent
curiosity
oh
while
i
live
let
me
not
be
admitted
under
special
favour
to
an
actor
let
me
not
see
how
cato
painted
or
how
caesar
combed
let
me
not
meet

stuck

hear
the

laughing
nor

pirouette
in
sober
sadness
nor

drop
from
mirth
to
sudden
melancholy

crossed
it

the

of

sit
twirling
their
thumbs
nor

the
fellow
who
holds
the
candle
for
the
moon
in

scene
between
lorenzo
and

spare
me
this
insight
into
secrets
i
am
not
bound
to
know
the
stage
is
not
a
mistress
that
we
are
sworn
to
undress
why
should
we
look
behind
the
glass
of

why
should
we
prick

bubble
that
reflects
the

and
turn
it
to
a
little

trust
a
little

something
to
fancy
i
observe
that
the
great
puppets
of
the
real
stage
who
themselves
play
a
grand
part
like
to
get
into
the
boxes
over
the
stage
where
they
see
nothing
from
the
proper
point
of
view
but
peep
and
pry
into
what
is
going
on
like
a
magpie
looking
into
a

just
like
them
so
they
look
down
upon
human
life
of
which
they
are
ignorant
they
see
the
exits
and
entrances
of
the
players
something
that
they
suspect
is
meant
to
be
kept
from
them
for
they
think
they
are
always
liable
to
be
imposed
upon
the
petty
pageant
of
an
hour
ends
with
each
scene
long
before
the
catastrophe
and
the
tragedy
of
life
is
turned
to
farce
under
their
eyes
these
people
laugh
loud
at

are
delighted
with

and

they
pay
no

to
anything
else
the

the

on

contrary

sunday
to

to

they
passed
with

once

his

distinguished

and
called
him
to
him
after
treating
him
with
much
cordial
familiarity
the

said

on
the
disadvantages
of
intellectual
superiority
the
chief
disadvantage
of
knowing
more
and
seeing
farther
than
others
is
not
to
be
generally
understood
a
man
is
in
consequence
of
this
liable
to
start
paradoxes
which
immediately
transport
him
beyond
the
reach
of
the
reader
a
person
speaking
once
in
a
slighting
manner
of
a
very
man
received
for

the
great
happiness
of
life
is
to
be
neither
better
nor
worse
than
the
general
run
of
those
you
meet
with
you
soon
find
a
mortifying
level
in
their
difference
to
what
you
particularly
pique
yourself
upon
what
is
the
use
of
being
moral
in
a
or
wise
in
bedlam
be
honest
as
this
world
goes
is
to
be
one
man
picked
out
of
ten
thousand
so
says
shakespear
and
the
commentators
have
not
added
that
under
these
circumstances
a
man
is
more
likely
to
become
the
butt
of
slander
than
the
mark
of
admiration
for
being
so
now
thou
particular
fellow
is
the
common
answer
to
all
such
pretensions
by
not
doing
as
those
at
rome
do
we
cut
ourselves
off
from
and
society
we
speak
another
language
have
notions
of
our
own
and
are
treated
as
of
a
different
species
nothing
can
be
more
awkward
than
to
intrude
with
any
such
ideas
among
the
common
herd
who
will
be
sure
to
stand
all
astonished
like
a
sort
of
steers
whom
some
beast
of
strange
and
foreign
race
unwares
is
chanced
far
straying
from
his
peers
so
will
their
ghastly
gaze
betray
their
hidden
fears
ignorance
of
another
meaning
is
a
sufficient
cause
of
fear
and
fear
produces
hatred
hence
the
suspicion
and
rancour
entertained
against
all
those
who
set
up
for
greater
refinement
and
wisdom
than
their
neighbours
it
is
in
vain
to
think
of
softening
down
this
spirit
of
hostility
by
simplicity
of
manners
or
by
condescending
to
persons
of
low
estate
the
more
you
condescend
the
more
they
will
presume
upon
it
they
will
fear
you
less
but
hate
you
more
and
will
be
the
more
determined
to
take
their
revenge
on
you
for
a
superiority
as
to
which
they
are
entirely
in
the
dark
and
of
which
you
yourself
seem
to
entertain
considerable
doubt
all
the
humility
in
the
world
will
only
pass
for
weakness
and
folly
they
have
no
notion
of
such
a
thing
they
always
put
their
best
foot
forward
and
argue
that
you
would
do
the
same
if
you
had
any
such
wonderful
talents
as
people
say
you
had
better
therefore
play
off
the
great
man
at
once
hector
swagger
talk
big
and
ride
the
high
horse
over
them
you
may
by
this
means
extort
outward
respect
or
common
civility
but
you
will
get
nothing
with
low
people
by
forbearance
and
but
open
insult
or
silent
contempt
coleridge

talks
to

about

about

do
understand
and
find

more
by
it
they
conceive
i
do
not
think
them
capable
of
anything
better
that
i
do
not
think
it
worth
while
as
the
vulgar
saying
is
to
a
word
to
a

once
complained
of
this
to
coleridge
thinking
it
hard
i
should
be
sent
to
coventry
for
not
making
a
prodigious
display
he
said
you
assume
a
certain
character
you
ought
to
produce
your
credentials
it
is
a
tax
upon
people
to
admit
superiority
of
any
kind
even
where
there
is
the
most
evident
proof
of
it
but
it
is
too
hard
a
task
for
the
imagination
to
admit
it
without
any
apparent
ground
at
all
there
is
not
a
greater
error
than
to
suppose
that
you
avoid
the
envy
malice
and
uncharitableness
so
common
in
the
world
by
going
among
people
without
pretensions
there
are
no
people
who
have
no
pretensions
or
the
fewer
their
pretensions
the
less
they
can
afford
to
acknowledge
yours
without
some
sort
of
value
received
the
more
information
individuals
possess
or
the
more
they
have
refined
upon
any
subject
the
more
readily
can
they
conceive
and
admit
the
same
kind
of
superiority
to
themselves
that
they
feel
over
others
but
from
the
low
dull
level
sink
of
ignorance
and
vulgarity
no
idea
or
love
of
excellence
can
arise
you
think
you
are
doing
mighty
well
with
them
that
you
are
laying
aside
the
buckram
of
pedantry
and
pretence
and
getting
the
character
of
a
plain
unassuming
good
sort
of
fellow
it
will
not
do
all
the
while
that
you
are
making
these
familiar
advances
and
wanting
to
be
at
your
ease
they
are
trying
to
recover
the
wind
of
you
you
may
forget
that
you
are
an
author
an
artist
or
what
not
they
do
not
forget
that
they
are
nothing
nor
bate
one
jot
of
their
desire
to
prove
you
in
the
same
predicament
they
take
hold
of
some
circumstance
in
your
dress
your
manner
of
entering
a
room
is
different
from
that
of
other
people
you
do
not
eat
vegetables
that
odd
you
have
a
particular
phrase
which
they
repeat
and
this
becomes
a
sort
of
standing
joke
you
look
grave
or
ill
you
talk
or
are
more
silent
than
usual
you
are
in
or
out
of
pocket
all
these
petty
inconsiderable
circumstances
in
which
you
resemble
or
are
unlike
other
people
form
so
many
counts
in
the
indictment
which
is
going
on
in
their
imaginations
against
you
and
are
so
many
contradictions
in
your
character
in
any
one
else
they
would
pass
unnoticed
but
in
a
person
of
whom
they
had
heard
so
much
they
can
not
make
them
out
at
all
meanwhile
those
things
in
which
you
may
really
excel
go
for
nothing
because
they
can
not
judge
of
them
they
speak
highly
of
some
book
which
you
do
not
like
and
therefore
you
make
no
answer
you
recommend
them
to
go
and
see
some
picture
in
which
they
do
not
find
much
to
admire
how
are
you
to
convince
them
that
you
are
right
can
you
make
them
perceive
that
the
fault
is
in
them
and
not
in
the
picture
unless
you
could
give
them
your
knowledge
they
hardly
distinguish
the
difference
between
a
correggio
and
a
common
daub
does
this
bring
you
any
nearer
to
an
understanding
the
more
you
know
of
the
difference
the
more
deeply
you
feel
it
or
the
more
earnestly
you
wish
to
convey
it
the
farther
do
you
find
yourself
removed
to
an
immeasurable
distance
from
the
possibility
of
making
them
enter
into
views
and
feelings
of
which
they
have
not
even
the
first
rudiments
you
can
not
make
them
see
with
your
eyes
and
they
must
judge
for
themselves
intellectual
is
not
like
bodily
strength
you
have
no
hold
of
the
understanding
of
others
but
by
their
sympathy
your
knowing
in
fact
so
much
more
about
a
subject
does
not
give
you
a
superiority
that
is
a
power
over
them
but
only
renders
it
the
more
impossible
for
you
to
make
the
least
impression
on
them
is
it
then
an
advantage
to
you
it
may
be
as
it
relates
to
your
own
private
satisfaction
but
it
places
a
greater
gulf
between
you
and
society
it
throws
in
your
way
at
every
turn
all
that
you
take
most
pride
and
pleasure
in
is
lost
upon
the
vulgar
eye
what
they
are
pleased
with
is
a
matter
of
indifference
or
of
distaste
to
you
in
seeing
a
number
of
persons
turn
over
a
portfolio
of
prints
from
different
masters
what
a
trial
it
is
to
the
patience
how
it
jars
the
nerves
to
hear
them
fall
into
raptures
at
some
flimsy
thing
and
pass
over
some
divine
expression
of
countenance
without
notice
or
with
a
remark
that
it
is
very
how
useless
it
is
in
such
cases
to
fret
or
argue
or
remonstrate
is
it
not
quite
as
well
to
be
without
all
this
hypercritical
fastidious
knowledge
and
to
be
pleased
or
displeased
as
it
happens
or
struck
with
the
first
fault
or
beauty
that
is
pointed
out
by
others
i
would
be
glad
almost
to
change
my
acquaintance
with
pictures
with
books
and
certainly
what
i
know
of
mankind
for
anybody
ignorance
of
them
it
is
recorded
in
the
life
of
some
worthy
whose
name
i
forget
that
he
was
one
of
those
loved
hospitality
and
respect
and
i
profess
to
belong
to
the
same
classification
of
mankind
civility
is
with
me
a
jewel
i
like
a
little
comfortable
cheer
and
careless
indolent
chat
i
hate
to
be
always
wise
or
aiming
at
wisdom
i
have
enough
to
do
with
literary
cabals
questions
critics
actors
without
taking
them
out
with
me
for
recreation
and
into
all
companies
i
wish
at
these
times
to
pass
for
a
fellow
and
is
all
i
ask
in
return
to
make
good
company
i
do
not
desire
to
be
always
posing
myself
or
others
with
the
questions
of
fate
foreknowledge
absolute
etc
i
must
unbend
sometimes
i
must
occasionally
lie
fallow
the
kind
of
conversation
that
i
affect
most
is
what
sort
of
a
day
it
is
and
whether
it
is
likely
to
rain
or
hold
up
fine
for
this
i
consider
as
enjoying
the
cum
dignitate
as
the
end
and
privilege
of
a
life
of
study
i
would
resign
myself
to
this
state
of
easy
indifference
but
i
find
i
can
not
i
must
maintain
a
certain
pretension
which
is
far
enough
from
my
wish
i
must
he
put
on
my
defence
i
must
take
up
the
gauntlet
continually
or
i
find
i
lose
ground
am
nothing
if
not
critical
while
i
am
thinking
what
it
is
or
how
i
came
to
blunder
in
quoting
a
passage
as
if
i
had
done
it
on
purpose
others
are
thinking
whether
i
am
not
really
as
dull
a
fellow
as
i
am
sometimes
said
to
be
if
a
drizzling
shower
patters
against
the
windows
it
puts
me
in
mind
of
a
mild
spring
rain
from
which
i
retired
twenty
years
ago
into
a
little
near
wem
in
shropshire
and
while
i
saw
the
plants
and
shrubs
before
the
door
imbibe
the
dewy
moisture
quaffed
a
glass
of
sparkling
ale
and
walked
home
in
the
dusk
of
evening
brighter
to
me
than
noonday
suns
at
present
are
would
i
indulge
this
feeling
in
vain
they
ask
me
what
news
there
is
and
stare
if
i
say
i
do
know
if
a
new
actress
has
come
out
why
must
i
have
seen
her
if
a
new
novel
has
appeared
why
must
i
have
read
it
i
at
one
time
used
to
go
and
take
a
hand
at
cribbage
with
a
friend
and
afterwards
discuss
a
cold
sirloin
of
beef
and
throw
out
a
few
lackadaisical
remarks
in
a
way
to
please
myself
but
it
would
not
do
long
i
set
up
little
pretension
and
therefore
the
little
that
i
did
set
up
was
taken
from
me
as
i
said
nothing
on
that
subject
myself
it
was
continually
thrown
in
my
teeth
that
i
was
an
author
from
having
me
at
this
disadvantage
my
friend
wanted
to
peg
on
a
hole
or
two
in
the
game
and
was
displeased
if
i
would
not
let
him
if
i
won
off
him
it
was
hard
he
should
be
beat
by
an
author
if
he
won
it
would
be
strange
if
he
did
not
understand
the
game
better
than
i
did
if
i
mentioned
my
favourite
game
of
rackets
there
was
a
general
silence
as
if
this
was
my
weak
point
if
i
complained
of
being
ill
it
was
asked
why
i
made
myself
so
if
i
said
such
an
actor
had
played
a
part
well
the
answer
was
there
was
a
different
account
in
one
of
the
newspapers
if
any
allusion
was
made
to
men
of
letters
there
was
a
suppressed
smile
if
i
told
a
humorous
story
it
was
difficult
to
say
whether
the
laugh
was
at
me
or
at
the
narrative
the
wife
hated
me
for
my
ugly
face
the
servants
because
i
could
not
always
get
them
tickets
for
the
play
and
because
they
could
not
tell
exactly
what
an
author
meant
if
a
paragraph
appeared
against
anything
i
had
written
i
found
it
was
ready
there
before
me
and
i
was
to
undergo
a
regular
i
submitted
to
all
this
till
i
was
tired
and
then
i
gave
it
up
one
of
the
miseries
of
intellectual
pretensions
is
that
of
those
you
come
in
contact
with
do
not
know
whether
you
are
an
impostor
or
not
i
dread
that
certain
anonymous
criticisms
should
get
into
the
hands
of
servants
where
i
go
or
that
my
hatter
or
shoemaker
should
happen
to
read
them
who
can
not
possibly
tell
whether
they
are
well
or
ill
founded
the
ignorance
of
the
world
leaves
one
at
the
mercy
of
its
malice
there
are
people
whose
good
opinion
or
you
want
setting
aside
all
literary
pretensions
and
it
is
hard
to
lose
by
an
ill
report
which
you
have
no
means
of
rectifying
what
you
can
not
gain
by
a
good
one
after
a
in
the
which
is
taken
in
by
a
gentleman
who
occupies
my
old
apartments
on
the
first
floor
my
landlord
brings
me
up
his
bill
of
some
standing
and
on
my
offering
to
give
him
so
much
in
money
and
a
note
of
hand
for
the
rest
shakes
his
head
and
says
he
is
afraid
he
could
make
no
use
of
it
soon
after
the
daughter
comes
in
and
on
my
mentioning
the
circumstance
carelessly
to
her
replies
gravely
indeed
her
father
has
been
almost
ruined
by
bills
is
the
unkindest
cut
of
it
is
in
vain
for
me
to
endeavour
to
explain
that
the
publication
in
which
i
am
abused
is
a
mere
government
engine
an
organ
of
a
political
faction
they
know
nothing
about
that
they
only
know
such
and
such
imputations
are
thrown
out
and
the
more
i
try
to
remove
them
the
more
they
think
there
is
some
truth
in
them
perhaps
the
people
of
the
house
are
strong
tories
government
agents
of
some
sort
is
it
for
me
to
enlighten
their
ignorance
if
i
say
i
once
wrote
a
thing
called
maurice
and
an
on
the
regal
in
the
former
of
which
allusion
is
made
to
a
noble
marquis
and
in
the
latter
to
a
great
personage
so
at
least
i
am
told
it
has
been
construed
and
that
croker
has
peremptory
instructions
to
retaliate
they
can
not
conceive
what
connection
there
can
be
between
me
and
such
distinguished
characters
i
can
get
no
farther
such
is
the
misery
of
pretensions
beyond
your
situation
and
which
are
not
backed
by
any
external
symbols
of
wealth
or
rank
intelligible
to
all
mankind
the
impertinence
of
admiration
is
scarcely
more
tolerable
than
the
demonstrations
of
contempt
i
have
known
a
person
whom
i
had
never
seen
before
besiege
me
all
with
asking
what
articles
i
had
written
in
the
review
i
was
at
last
ashamed
to
answer
to
my
splendid
sins
in
that
way
others
will
pick
out
something
not
yours
and
say
they
are
sure
no
one
else
could
write
it
by
the
first
sentence
they
can
always
tell
your
style
now
i
hate
my
style
to
be
known
as
i
hate
all
these
obsequious
flatterers
could
not
pay
me
a
worse
compliment
then
there
are
those
who
make
a
point
of
reading
everything
you
write
which
is
fulsome
while
others
more
provoking
regularly
lend
your
works
to
a
friend
as
soon
as
they
receive
them
they
pretty
well
know
your
notions
on
the
different
subjects
from
having
heard
you
talk
about
them
besides
they
have
a
greater
value
for
your
personal
character
than
they
have
for
your
writings
you
explain
things
better
in
a
common
way
when
you
are
not
aiming
at
effect
others
tell
you
of
the
faults
they
have
heard
found
with
your
last
book
and
that
they
defend
your
style
in
general
from
a
charge
of
obscurity
a
friend
once
told
me
of
a
quarrel
he
had
had
with
a
near
relation
who
denied
that
i
knew
how
to
spell
the
commonest
words
these
are
comfortable
confidential
communications
to
which
authors
who
have
their
friends
and
excusers
are
subject
a
gentleman
told
me
that
a
lady
had
objected
to
my
use
of
the
word
as
bad
grammar
he
said
he
thought
it
a
pity
that
i
did
not
take
more
care
but
that
the
lady
was
perhaps
prejudiced
as
her
husband
held
a
government
office
i
looked
for
the
word
and
found
it
in
a
motto
from
butler
i
was
piqued
and
desired
him
to
tell
the
fair
critic
that
the
fault
was
not
in
me
but
in
one
who
had
far
more
wit
more
learning
and
loyalty
than
i
could
pretend
to
then
again
some
will
pick
out
the
flattest
thing
of
yours
they
can
find
to
load
it
with
panegyrics
and
others
tell
you
by
way
of
letting
you
see
how
high
they
rank
your
capacity
that
your
best
passages
are
failures
lamb
has
a
knack
of
tasting
or
as
he
would
say
the
insipid
leigh
hunt
has
a
trick
of
turning
away
from
the
relishing
morsels
you
put
on
his
plate
there
is
no
getting
the
start
of
some
people
do
what
you
will
they
can
do
it
better
meet
with
what
success
you
may
their
own
good
opinion
stands
them
in
better
stead
and
runs
before
the
applause
of
the
world
i
once
showed
a
person
of
this
overweening
turn
with
no
small
triumph
i
confess
a
letter
of
a
very
flattering
description
i
had
received
from
the
celebrated
count
stendhal
dated
rome
he
returned
it
with
a
smile
of
indifference
and
said
he
had
had
a
letter
from
rome
himself
the
day
before
from
his
friend
s
i
did
not
think
this
to
the
matter
godwin
pretends
i
never
wrote
anything
worth
a
farthing
but
my
to
vetus
and
that
i
fail
altogether
when
i
attempt
to
write
an
essay
or
anything
in
a
short
compass
what
can
one
do
in
such
cases
shall
i
confess
a
weakness
the
only
i
know
to
these
rebuffs
and
mortifications
is
sometimes
in
an
accidental
notice
or
involuntary
mark
of
distinction
from
a
stranger
i
feel
the
force
of
horace
i
like
to
be
pointed
out
in
the
street
or
to
hear
people
ask
in
powell
court
is
hazlitt
this
is
to
me
a
pleasing
extension
of
one
personal
identity
your
name
so
repeated
leaves
an
echo
like
music
on
the
ear
it
stirs
the
blood
like
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
it
shows
that
other
people
are
curious
to
see
you
that
they
think
of
you
and
feel
an
interest
in
you
without
your
knowing
it
this
is
a
bolster
to
lean
upon
a
lining
to
your
poor
shivering
threadbare
opinion
of
yourself
you
want
some
such
cordial
to
exhausted
spirits
and
relief
to
the
dreariness
of
abstract
speculation
you
are
something
and
from
occupying
a
place
in
the
thoughts
of
others
think
less
contemptuously
of
yourself
you
are
the
better
able
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
prejudice
and
vulgar
abuse
it
is
pleasant
in
this
way
to
have
your
opinion
quoted
against
yourself
and
your
own
sayings
repeated
to
you
as
good
things
i
was
once
talking
to
an
intelligent
man
in
the
pit
and
criticising
knight
performance
of
filch
he
said
simmons
was
the
fellow
to
play
that
character
he
added
was
a
most
excellent
remark
made
upon
his
acting
it
in
the
i
think
it
was
he
looked
as
if
he
had
the
gallows
in
one
eye
and
a
pretty
girl
in
the
i
said
nothing
but
was
in
remarkably
good
humour
the
rest
of
the
evening
i
have
seldom
been
in
a
company
where
has
been
talked
of
but
some
one
has
asked
in
the
course
of
it
did
any
one
ever
see
an
account
of
one
cavanagh
that
appeared
some
time
back
in
most
of
the
papers
is
it
known
who
wrote
it
these
are
trying
moments
i
had
a
triumph
over
a
person
whose
name
i
will
not
mention
on
the
following
occasion
i
happened
to
be
saying
something
about
burke
and
was
expressing
my
opinion
of
his
talents
in
no
measured
terms
when
this
gentleman
interrupted
me
by
saying
he
thought
for
his
part
that
burke
had
been
greatly
overrated
and
then
added
in
a
careless
way
did
you
read
a
character
of
him
in
the
last
number
of
the
wrote
it
i
could
not
resist
the
antithesis
but
was
afterwards
ashamed
of
my
momentary
petulance
yet
no
one
that
i
find
ever
spares
me
some
persons
seek
out
and
obtrude
themselves
on
public
characters
in
order
as
it
might
seem
to
pick
out
their
failings
and
afterwards
betray
them
appearances
are
for
it
but
truth
and
a
better
knowledge
of
nature
are
against
this
interpretation
of
the
matter
sycophants
and
flatterers
are
undesignedly
treacherous
and
fickle
they
are
prone
to
admire
inordinately
at
first
and
not
finding
a
constant
supply
of
food
for
this
kind
of
sickly
appetite
take
a
distaste
to
the
object
of
their
idolatry
to
be
even
with
themselves
for
their
credulity
they
sharpen
their
wits
to
spy
out
faults
and
are
delighted
to
find
that
this
answers
better
than
their
first
employment
it
is
a
course
of
study
audible
and
full
of
vent
they
have
the
organ
of
wonder
and
the
organ
of
fear
in
a
prominent
degree
the
first
requires
new
objects
of
admiration
to
satisfy
its
uneasy
cravings
the
second
makes
them
crouch
to
power
wherever
its
shifting
standard
appears
and
willing
to
curry
favour
with
all
parties
and
ready
to
betray
any
out
of
sheer
weakness
and
servility
i
do
not
think
they
mean
any
harm
at
least
i
can
look
at
this
obliquity
with
indifference
in
my
own
particular
case
i
have
been
more
disposed
to
resent
it
as
i
have
seen
it
practised
upon
others
where
i
have
been
better
able
to
judge
of
the
extent
of
the
mischief
and
the
heartlessness
and
idiot
folly
it
discovered
i
do
not
think
great
intellectual
attainments
are
any
recommendation
to
the
women
they
puzzle
them
and
are
a
diversion
to
the
main
question
if
scholars
talk
to
ladies
of
what
they
understand
their
hearers
are
none
the
wiser
if
they
talk
of
other
things
they
prove
themselves
fools
the
conversation
between
angelica
and
foresight
in
for
is
a
receipt
in
full
for
all
such
overstrained
nonsense
while
he
is
wandering
among
the
signs
of
the
zodiac
she
is
standing
on
the
earth
it
has
been
remarked
that
poets
do
not
choose
mistresses
very
wisely
i
believe
it
is
not
choice
but
necessity
if
they
could
throw
the
handkerchief
like
the
grand
turk
i
imagine
we
should
see
scarce
mortals
but
rather
goddesses
surrounding
their
steps
and
each
exclaiming
with
lord
byron
own
ionian
maid
so
shalt
thou
find
me
ever
at
thy
side
here
and
hereafter
if
the
last
may
be
ah
no
these
are
bespoke
carried
of
by
men
of
mortal
not
of
ethereal
mould
and
thenceforth
the
poet
from
whose
mind
the
ideas
of
love
and
beauty
are
inseparable
as
dreams
from
sleep
goes
on
the
forlorn
hope
of
the
passion
and
dresses
up
the
first
dulcinea
that
will
take
compassion
on
him
in
all
the
colours
of
fancy
what
boots
it
to
complain
if
the
delusion
lasts
for
life
and
the
rainbow
still
paints
its
form
in
the
cloud
there
is
one
mistake
i
would
wish
if
possible
to
correct
men
of
letters
artists
and
others
not
succeeding
with
women
in
a
certain
rank
of
life
think
the
objection
is
to
their
want
of
fortune
and
that
they
shall
stand
a
better
chance
by
descending
lower
where
only
their
good
qualities
or
talents
will
be
thought
of
oh
worse
and
worse
the
objection
is
to
themselves
not
to
their
fortune
to
their
abstraction
to
their
absence
of
mind
to
their
unintelligible
and
romantic
notions
women
of
education
may
have
a
glimpse
of
their
meaning
may
get
a
clue
to
their
character
but
to
all
others
they
are
thick
darkness
if
the
mistress
smiles
at
their
ideal
advances
the
maid
will
laugh
outright
she
will
throw
water
over
you
get
her
sister
to
listen
send
her
sweetheart
to
ask
you
what
you
mean
will
set
the
village
or
the
house
upon
your
back
it
will
be
a
farce
a
comedy
a
standing
jest
for
a
year
and
then
the
murder
will
out
scholars
should
be
sworn
at
highgate
they
are
no
match
for
chambermaids
or
wenches
at
they
had
better
try
their
hands
on
heiresses
or
ladies
of
quality
these
last
have
high
notions
of
themselves
that
may
fit
some
of
your
epithets
they
are
above
mortality
so
are
your
thoughts
but
with
low
life
trick
ignorance
and
cunning
you
have
nothing
in
common
whoever
you
are
that
think
you
can
make
a
compromise
or
a
conquest
there
by
good
nature
or
good
sense
be
warned
by
a
friendly
voice
and
retreat
in
time
from
the
unequal
contest
if
as
i
have
said
above
scholars
are
no
match
for
chambermaids
on
the
other
hand

it
is
astonishing
how
soon
a
fellow
without
education
will
learn
to
cheat
he
is
impervious
to
any
ray
of
liberal
knowledge
his
understanding
is
not
pierceable
by
power
of
any
star
but
it
is
porous
to
all

chicanery
stratagems

says

i
do
not

how
far
this
example
contradicts
my
theory
i
think
it
is
a
rule
that
men
in
business
should
not
be

things
any
one
will
be
almost
sure
to

who
has
no

in

a

education

will
not
enable
a

to
drive
a

to
overreach
another
or
even
to
guard
himself
from
being
overreached
as
shakespear
says
that
have
a
good
face
is
the
effect
of

reading
and
writing
come
by
nature
so
it
might
be
argued
that
to
be
a
knave
is
the
gift
of
fortune

to
play
the
fool
to

it

many
a
man
has
been
hindered
from
pushing
his
fortune
in
the
world
by
an
early
cultivation
of
his
moral
sense
and
has
repented
of
it
at
leisure
during
the
rest
of
his

a

man
said
of
my
father
that
he
would
not

a

of
his
to
school
to
him
on
any
account
for
that
by
teaching
him
to
speak
the
truth
he
would
disqualify
him
from
getting
his
living
in
the
world
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
add
any
illustration
to
prove
that
the
most
original
and
profound
thinkers
are
not
always
the
most
successful
or
popular
writers
this
is
not
merely
a
temporary
disadvantage
but
many
great
philosophers
have
not

been
scouted
while
they
were

forgotten
as
soon
as
they

the

of

perhaps
sufficient
to

i
do
not

on

by

spenser
a
lady
was
complaining
to
a
friend
of
mine
of
the
credulity
of
people
in
attending
to
quack
advertisements
and
wondering
who
could
be
taken
in
by
them
for
that
she
had
never
bought
but
one
bottle
of
elixir
of
life
and
it
had
done
her
no
sort
of
good
this
anecdote
seemed
to
explain
pretty
well
what
made
it
worth
the
while
to
advertise
his
wares
in
every
newspaper
in
the
kingdom
he
would
no
doubt
be
satisfied
if
every
delicate
sceptical
invalid
in
his
majesty
dominions
gave
his
elixir
one
trial
merely
to
show
the
absurdity
of
the
thing
we
affect
to
laugh
at
the
folly
of
those
who
put
faith
in
nostrums
but
are
willing
to
see
ourselves
whether
there
is
any
truth
in
them
there
is
a
strong
tendency
in
the
human
mind
to
flatter
itself
with
secret
hopes
with
some
lucky
reservation
in
our
own
favour
though
reason
may
point
out
the
grossness
of
the
trick
in
general
and
besides
there
is
a
wonderful
power
in
words
formed
into
regular
propositions
and
printed
in
capital
letters
to
draw
the
assent
after
them
till
we
have
proof
of
their
fallacy
the
ignorant
and
idle
believe
what
they
read
as
scotch
philosophers
demonstrate
the
existence
of
a
material
world
and
other
learned
propositions
from
the
evidence
of
their
senses
the
ocular
proof
is
all
that
is
wanting
in
either
case
as
hypocrisy
is
said
to
be
the
highest
compliment
to
virtue
the
art
of
lying
is
the
strongest
acknowledgment
of
the
force
of
truth
we
can
hardly
a
thing
to
be
a
lie
though
we
it
to
be
so
the
direct
even
as
it
stands
in
the
columns
of
the
newspaper
branded
with
the
title
of
advertisement
before
it
claims
some
sort
of
attention
and
respect
for
the
merits
that
it
discloses
though
we
think
the
candidate
for
public
favour
and
support
has
hit
upon
perhaps
an
injudicious
way
of
laying
them
before
the
world
still
there
may
be
something
in
them
and
even
the
outrageous
improbability
and
extravagance
of
the
statement
on
the
very
face
of
it
stagger
us
and
leave
a
hankering
to
inquire
farther
into
it
because
we
think
the
advertiser
would
hardly
have
the
impudence
to
hazard
such
barefaced
absurdities
without
some
foundation
such
is
the
strength
of
the
association
between
words
and
things
in
the
mind
so
much
oftener
must
our
credulity
have
been
justified
by
the
event
than
imposed
upon
if
every
second
story
we
heard
was
an
invention
we
should
lose
our
mechanical
disposition
to
trust
to
the
meaning
of
sounds
just
as
when
we
have
met
with
a
number
of
counterfeit
pieces
of
coin
we
suspect
good
ones
but
our
implicit
assent
to
what
we
hear
is
a
proof
how
much
more
sincerity
and
good
faith
there
is
in
the
sum
total
of
our
dealings
with
one
another
than
artifice
and
imposture
elevate
and
surprise
is
the
great
art
of
quackery
and
puffing
to
raise
a
lively
and
exaggerated
image
in
the
mind
and
take
it
by
surprise
before
it
can
recover
breath
as
it
were
so
that
by
having
been
caught
in
the
trap
it
is
unwilling
to
retract
entirely
has
a
secret
desire
to
find
itself
in
the
right
and
a
determination
to
see
whether
it
is
or
not
describe
a
picture
as
and
these
words
excite
certain
ideas
in
the
mind
like
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
which
are
not
to
be
quelled
except
by
seeing
the
picture
itself
nor
even
then
if
it
is
viewed
by
the
help
of
a
catalogue
written
expressly
for
the
occasion
by
the
artist
himself
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
would
say
such
things
of
his
picture
unless
they
were
allowed
by
all
the
world
and
he
repeats
them
on
this
gentle
understanding
till
all
the
world
allows
them
so
reputation
runs
in
a
vicious
circle
and
merit
limps
behind
it
mortified
and
abashed
at
its
own
insignificance
it
has
been
said
that
the
test
of
fame
or
popularity
is
to
consider
the
number
of
times
your
name
is
repeated
by
others
or
is
brought
to
their
recollection
in
the
course
of
a
year
at
this
rate
a
man
has
his
reputation
in
his
own
hands
and
by
the
help
of
puffing
and
the
press
may
forestall
the
voice
of
posterity
and
stun
the
ear
of
his
contemporaries
a
name
let
off
in
your
hearing
continually
with
some
bouncing
epithet
affixed
to
it
startles
you
like
the
report
of
a
pistol
close
at
your
ear
you
can
not
help
the
effect
upon
the
imagination
though
you
know
it
is
perfectly
harmless
et
praeterea
so
if
you
see
the
same
name
staring
you
in
the
face
in
great
letters
at
the
corner
of
every
street
you
involuntarily
think
the
owner
of
it
must
be
a
great
man
to
occupy
so
large
a
space
in
the
eye
of
the
town
the
appeal
is
made
in
the
first
instance
to
the
senses
but
it
sinks
below
the
surface
into
the
mind
there
are
some
indeed
who
publish
their
own
disgrace
and
make
their
names
a
common
and
nuisance
notoriety
being
all
that
they
wa
though
you
may
laugh
in
his
face
it
pays
expenses

and
his
drum
typify
many
a
modern
adventurer

for
unearned
laurels
and
unblushing
honours
of
all

lottery
puffs
are
the
most
ingenious
and
most
innocent
a
collection
of
them
would
make
an
amusing
they
are
still
various
and
the
same
with
that
infinite
ruse
with
which
they
lull
the
reader
at
the
outset
out
of
all
suspicion
the
insinuating
turn
in
the
middle
the
at
the
ruling
passion
at
last
by
which
your
spare
cash
is
conjured
clean
out
of
the
pocket
in
spite
of
resolution
by
the
same
stale
repeated
artifice
of
and
a
imposition
nothing
however
can
be
a
stronger
proof
of
the
power
of
fascinating
the
public
judgment
through
the
eye
alone
i
know
a
gentleman
who
amassed
a
considerable
fortune
so
as
to
be
able
to
keep
his
carriage
by
printing
nothing
but
lottery
placards
and
handbills
of
a
colossal
size
another
friend
of
mine
of
no
mean
talents
was
applied
to
as
a
snug
thing
in
the
way
of
business
to
write
regular
lottery
puffs
for
a
large
house
in
the
city
and
on
having
a
parcel
of
samples
returned
on
his
hands
as
done
in
too
severe
and
terse
a
style
complained
quaintly
enough
modest
merit
never
could
succeed
even
lord
byron
as
he
tells
us
has
been
accused
of
writing
there
are
various
ways
of
playing
off
before
the
public
and
keeping
one
name
alive
the
newspapers
the
the
walls
of
empty
houses
the
shutters
of
windows
the
blank
covers
of
magazines
and
reviews
are
open
to
every
one
i
have
heard
of
a
man
of
literary
celebrity
sitting
in
his
study
writing
letters
of
remonstrance
to
himself
on
the
gross
defects
of
a
plan
of
education
he
had
just
published
and
which
remained
unsold
on
the
bookseller
counter
another
feigned
himself
dead
in
order
to
see
what
would
be
said
of
him
in
the
newspapers
and
to
excite
a
sensation
in
this
way
a
flashy
pamphlet
has
been
run
to
a
edition
and
thus
ensured
the
writer
a
date
among
political
charlatans
by
regularly
striking
off
a
new
to
every
fifty
or
a
hundred
copies
that
were
sold
this
is
a
vile
practice
it
is
an
erroneous
idea
got
abroad
and
which
i
will
contradict
here
that
paragraphs
are
paid
for
in
the
leading
journals
it
is
quite
out
of
the
question
a
favourable
notice
of
an
author
an
actress
may
be
inserted
through
interest
or
to
oblige
a
friend
but
it
must
invariably
be
done
for
not
when
i
formerly
had
to
do
with
these
sort
of
critical
verdicts
i
was
generally
sent
out
of
the
way
when
any
had
a
friend
at
court
and
was
to
be
tenderly
handled
for
the
rest
or
those
of
robust
constitutions
i
had
given
me
sometimes
i
ran
out
of
the
course
to
be
sure
poor
perry
what
bitter
complaints
he
used
to
make
that
by
at
lords
and
scotchmen
i
should
not
leave
him
a
place
to
dine
out
at
the
expression
of
his
face
at
these
moments
as
if
he
should
shortly
be
without
a
friend
in
the
world
was
truly
pitiable
what
squabbles
we
used
to
have
about
kean
and
miss
stephens
the
only
theatrical
favourites
i
ever
had
billington
had
got
some
notion
that
miss
stephens
would
never
make
a
singer
and
it
was
the
torment
of
perry
life
as
he
told
me
in
confidence
that
he
could
not
get
any
two
people
to
be
of
the
same
opinion
on
any
one
point
i
shall
appearance
in
the
i
have
reason
to
remember
that
article
it
was
almost
the
last
i
ever
wrote
with
any
pleasure
to
myself
i
had
been
down
on
a
visit
to
my
friends
near
chertsey
and
on
my
return
had
stopped
at
an
inn
near
where
i
had
got
the
and
had
read
it
the
next
day
i
walked
cheerfully
to
town
it
was
a
fine
sunny
morning
in
the
end
of
autumn
and
as
i
repeated
the
beautiful
song
knows
no
return
of
spring
i
meditated
my
next
day
criticism
trying
to
do
all
the
justice
i
could
to
so
inviting
a
subject
i
was
not
a
little
proud
of
it
by
anticipation
i
had
just
then
begun
to
stammer
out
my
sentiments
on
paper
and
was
in
a
kind
of
honeymoon
of
authorship
but
soon
after
my
final
hopes
of
happiness
and
of
human
liberty
were
blighted
nearly
at
the
same
time
and
since
then
i
have
had
no
pleasure
in
anything
and
love
himself
can
flatter
me
no
more
it
was
not
so
ten
years
since
ten
short
years
ah
how
fast
those
years
run
that
hurry
us
away
from
our
last
fond
dream
of
bliss
when
i
loitered
along
thy
green
retreats
o
twickenham
and
conned
over
with
enthusiastic
delight
the
chequered
view
which
one
of
thy
favourites
drew
of
human
life
i
deposited
my
account
of
the
play
at
the
morning
chronicle
office
in
the
afternoon
and
went
to
see
miss
stephens
as
polly
those
were
happy
times
in
which
she
first
came
out
in
this
character
in
mandane
where
she
sang
the
delicious
air
the
cruel
tyrant
love
so
as
it
can
never
be
sung
again
in
in
a
where
the
scene
opened
with
her
and
miss
matthews
in
a
painted
garden
of
roses
and
honeysuckles
and
thou
nurse
of
young
thrilled
from
two
sweet
voices
in
turn
oh
may
my
ears
sometimes
still
drink
the
same
sweet
sounds
embalmed
with
the
spirit
of
youth
of
health
and
joy
but
in
the
thoughts
of
an
instant
but
in
a
dream
of
fancy
and
i
shall
hardly
need
to
complain
when
i
got
back
after
the
play
perry
called
out
with
his
cordial
grating
voice
how
did
she
do
and
on
my
speaking
in
high
terms
answered
that
had
been
to
dine
with
his
friend
the
duke
that
some
conversation
had
passed
on
the
subject
he
was
afraid
it
was
not
the
thing
it
was
not
the
true
style
but
as
i
had
written
the
article
holding
my
peroration
on
the
carelessly
in
his
hand
might
pass
i
could
perceive
that
the
rogue
licked
his
lips
at
it
and
had
already
in
imagination
golden
opinions
of
all
sorts
of
by
this
very
criticism
and
i
had
the
satisfaction
the
next
day
to
meet
miss
stephens
coming
out
of
the
editor
room
who
had
been
to
thank
him
for
his
very
flattering
account
of
her
i
was
sent
to
see
kean
the
first
night
of
his
performance
in
shylock
when
there
were
about
a
hundred
people
in
the
pit
but
from
his
masterly
and
spirited
delivery
of
the
first
striking
speech
such
a
day
you
called
me
a
dog
i
perceived
it
was
a
hollow
thing
so
it
was
given
out
in
the
but
perry
was
continually
at
me
as
other
people
were
at
him
and
was
afraid
it
would
not
last
it
was
to
no
purpose
i
said
would
last
yet
i
am
in
the
right
hitherto
it
has
been
said
ridiculously
that
kean
was
written
up
in
the
i
beg
leave
to
state
my
opinion
that
no
actor
can
be
written
up
or
down
by
a
paper
an
author
may
be
puffed
into
notice
or
damned
by
criticism
because
his
book
may
not
have
been
read
an
artist
may
be
overrated
or
undeservedly
decried
because
the
public
is
not
much
accustomed
to
see
or
judge
of
pictures
but
an
actor
is
judged
by
his
peers
the
public
and
must
stand
or
fall
by
his
own
merits
or
defects
the
critic
may
give
the
tone
or
have
a
casting
voice
where
popular
opinion
is
divided
but
he
can
no
more
that
opinion
either
way
or
wrest
it
from
its
base
in
common
sense
and
feeling
than
he
can
move
stonehenge
kean
had
however
physical
disadvantages
and
strong
prejudices
to
encounter
and
so
far
the
and
part
of
the
press
might
have
been
of
service
in
helping
him
to
his
seat
in
the
public
favour
may
he
long
keep
it
with
dignity
and
firmness
it
was
pretended
by
the
covent
garden
people
and
some
others
at
the
time
that
kean
popularity
was
a
mere
effect
of
love
of
novelty
a
nine
days
wonder
like
the
rage
after
master
betty
acting
and
would
be
as
soon
over
the
comparison
did
not
hold
master
betty
acting
was
so
far
wonderful
and
drew
crowds
to
see
it
as
a
mere
singularity
because
he
was
a
boy
kean
was
a
grown
man
and
there
was
no
rule
or
precedent
established
in
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
why
some
other
man
should
not
appear
in
tragedy
as
great
as
john
kemble
farther
master
betty
acting
was
a
singular
phenomenon
but
it
was
also
as
beautiful
as
it
was
singular
i
saw
him
in
the
part
of
douglas
and
he
seemed
almost
like
gay
creature
of
the
element
moving
about
gracefully
with
all
the
flexibility
of
youth
and
murmuring
aeolian
sounds
with
plaintive
tenderness
i
shall
never
forget
the
way
in
which
he
repeated
the
line
in
which
young
norval
says
speaking
of
the
fate
of
two
brothers
and
in
my
mind
happy
was
he
that
died
the
tones
fell
and
seemed
to
linger
prophetic
on
my
ear
perhaps
the
wonder
was
made
greater
than
it
was
boys
at
that
age
can
often
read
remarkably
well
and
certainly
are
not
without
natural
grace
and
sweetness
of
voice
the
westminster
schoolboys
are
a
better
company
of
comedians
than
we
find
at
most
of
our
theatres
as
to
the
understanding
a
part
like
douglas
at
least
i
see
no
difficulty
on
that
score
i
myself
used
to
recite
the
speech
in
enfield
with
good
emphasis
and
discretion
when
at
school
and
entered
about
the
same
age
into
the
wild
sweetness
of
the
sentiments
in
radcliffe
of
the
i
am
sure
quite
as
much
as
i
should
do
now
yet
the
same
experiment
has
been
often
tried
since
and
has
uniformly
failed
it
was
soon
after
this
that
coleridge
returned
from
italy
and
he
got
one
day
into
a
long
tirade
to
explain
what
a
ridiculous
farce
the
whole
was
and
how
all
the
people
abroad
wore
shocked
at
the
of
the
english
nation
who
on
this
and
every
other
occasion
were
open
to
the
artifices
of
all
sorts
of
quacks
wondering
how
any
persons
with
the
smallest
pretensions
to
common
sense
could
for
a
moment
suppose
that
a
boy
could
act
the
characters
of
men
without
any
of
their
knowledge
their
experience
or
their
passions
we
made
some
faint
resistance
but
in
vain
the
discourse
then
took
a
turn
and
coleridge
began
a
laboured
eulogy
on
some
promising
youth
the
son
of
an
english
artist
whom
he
had
met
in
italy
and
who
had
wandered
all
over
the
campagna
with
him
whose
talents
he
assured
us
were
the
admiration
of
all
rome
and
whose
early
designs
had
almost
all
the
grace
and
purity
of
raphael
at
last
some
one
interrupted
the
endless
theme
by
saying
a
little
impatiently
just
now
you
would
not
let
us
believe
our
own
eyes
and
ears
about
young
betty
because
you
have
a
theory
against
premature
talents
and
now
you
start
a
boy
phenomenon
that
nobody
knows
anything
about
but
yourself
a
young
artist
that
you
tell
us
is
to
rival
raphael
the
truth
is
we
like
to
have
something
to
admire
ourselves
as
well
as
to
make
other
people
gape
and
stare
at
but
then
it
must
be
a
discovery
of
our
own
an
idol
of
our
own
making
and
setting
up
if
others
stumble
on
the
discovery
before
us
or
join
in
crying
it
up
to
the
skies
we
then
set
to
work
to
prove
that
this
is
a
vulgar
delusion
and
show
our
sagacity
and
freedom
from
prejudice
by
pulling
it
in
pieces
with
all
the
coolness
imaginable
whether
we
blow
the
bubble
or
crush
it
in
our
hands
vanity
and
the
desire
of
empty
distinction
are
equally
at
the
bottom
of
our
sanguine
credulity
or
fastidious
scepticism
there
are
some
who
always
fall
in
with
the
fashionable
prejudice
as
others
affect
singularity
of
opinion
on
all
such
points
according
as
they
think
they
have
more
or
less
wit
to
judge
for
themselves
if
a
little
varnishing
and
daubing
a
little
puffing
and
quacking
and
giving
yourself
a
good
name
and
getting
a
friend
to
speak
a
word
for
you
is
excusable
in
any
profession
it
is
i
think
in
that
of
painting
painting
is
an
occult
science
and
requires
a
little
ostentation
and
in
the
professor
a
man
may
here
rival
katterfelto
his
hair
on
end
at
his
own
wonders
wondering
for
his
bread
for
if
he
does
not
he
may
in
the
end
go
without
it
he
may
ride
on
a
horse
in
green
spectacles
and
attract
notice
to
his
person
anyhow
he
can
if
he
only
works
hard
at
his
profession
if
only
is
when
he
is
he
is
acting
let
him
make
the
fools
stare
but
give
others
something
worth
looking
at
good
mr
carver
and
gilder
good
mr
printer
devil
good
billsticker
me
your
offices
unmolested
painting
is
a
plain
ground
and
requires
a
great
many
heraldic
quarterings
and
facings
to
set
it
off
lay
on
and
do
not
spare
no
man
merit
can
be
fairly
judged
of
if
he
is
not
known
and
how
can
he
be
known
if
he
keeps
entirely
in
the
background
a
great
name
in
art
goes
but
a
little
way
is
chilled
as
it
creeps
along
the
surface
of
the
world
without
something
to
revive
and
make
it
blaze
up
with
fresh
splendour
fame
is
here
almost
obscurity
it
is
long
before
your
name
affixed
to
a
sterling
design
will
be
spelt
out
by
an
undiscerning
regardless
public
have
it
proclaimed
therefore
as
a
necessary
precaution
by
sound
of
trumpet
at
the
corners
of
the
street
let
it
be
stuck
as
a
label
in
your
mouth
carry
it
on
a
placard
at
your
back
otherwise
the
world
will
never
trouble
themselves
about
you
or
will
very
soon
forget
you
a
celebrated
artist
of
the
present
day
whose
name
is
engraved
at
the
bottom
of
some
of
the
most
touching
specimens
of
english
art
once
had
a
call
on
him
who
on
entering
his
room
exclaimed
with
some
surprise
are
you
a
painter
sir
the
other
made
answer
a
little
startled
in
his
turn
did
you
know
that
did
you
never
see
my
name
at
the
bottom
of
prints
he
could
not
recollect
that
he
had
yet
you
sell
and
prints
painter
names
then
did
he
recollect
did
he
know
west
yes
opie
fuseli
yes
you
never
heard
of
me
can
not
say
that
i
ever
did
it
was
plain
from
this
conversation
that
northcote
had
not
kept
company
enough
with
and
newspaper
critics
on
another
occasion
a
country
gentleman
who
was
sitting
to
him
for
his
portrait
asked
him
if
he
had
any
pictures
in
the
exhibition
at
somerset
house
and
on
his
replying
in
the
affirmative
desired
to
know
what
they
were
he
mentioned
among
others
the
marriage
of
two
children
on
which
the
gentleman
expressed
great
surprise
and
said
that
was
the
very
picture
his
wife
was
always
teasing
him
to
go
and
have
another
look
at
though
he
had
never
noticed
the
painter
name
when
the
public
are
so
eager
to
be
amused
and
care
so
little
who
it
is
that
amuses
them
it
is
not
amiss
to
remind
them
of
it
now
and
then
or
even
to
have
a
starling
taught
to
repeat
the
name
to
which
they
owe
such
misprised
obligations
in
their
drowsy
ears
on
any
other
principle
i
can
not
conceive
how
painters
not
without
genius
or
industry
can
fling
themselves
at
the
head
of
the
public
in
the
manner
they
do
having
lives
written
of
themselves
busts
made
of
themselves
prints
stuck
in
the
of
themselves
and
their
names
placed
in
first
row
of
the
rubric
with
those
of
rubens
raphael
and
michael
angelo
swearing
by
themselves
or
their
proxies
that
these
glorified
spirits
would
do
well
to
leave
the
abodes
of
the
blest
in
order
to
stand
in
mute
wonder
and
with
uplifted
hands
before
some
production
of
theirs
which
is
yet
hardly
dry
oh
whatever
you
do
leave
that
string
untouched
it
will
jar
the
rash
and
unhallowed
hand
that
meddles
with
it
profane
not
the
mighty
dead
by
mixing
them
up
with
the
uncanonised
living
leave
yourself
a
reversion
in
immortality
beyond
the
noisy
clamour
of
the
day
do
not
quite
lose
your
respect
for
public
opinion
by
making
it
in
all
cases
a
palpable
cheat
the
echo
of
your
own
lungs
that
are
hoarse
with
calling
on
the
world
to
admire
do
not
think
to
bully
posterity
or
to
cozen
your
contemporaries
be
not
always
anticipating
the
effect
of
your
picture
on
the
town
think
more
about
deserving
success
than
commanding
it
in
issuing
so
many
promissory
notes
upon
the
bank
of
fame
do
not
forget
you
have
to
pay
in
sterling
gold
believe
that
there
is
something
in
the
pursuit
of
high
art
beyond
the
manufacture
of
a
paragraph
or
the
collection
of
receipts
at
the
door
of
an
exhibition
venerate
art
as
art
study
the
works
of
others
and
inquire
into
those
of
nature
gaze
at
beauty
become
great
by
great
efforts
and
not
by
pompous
pretensions
do
not
think
the
world
was
blind
to
merit
before
your
time
nor
make
the
reputation
of
great
geniuses
the
to
your
vanity
you
have
done
enough
to
insure
yourself
attention
you
have
now
only
to
do
something
to
deserve
it
and
to
make
good
all
that
you
have
aspired
to
do
there
is
a
silent
and
systematic
assumption
of
superiority
which
is
as
barefaced
and
unprincipled
an
imposture
as
the
most
impudent
puffing
you
may
by
a
tacit
or
avowed
censure
on
all
other
arts
on
all
works
of
art
on
all
other
pretensions
tastes
talents
but
your
own
produce
a
complete
ostracism
in
the
world
of
intellect
and
leave
yourself
and
your
own
performances
alone
standing
a
mighty
monument
in
an
universal
waste
and
wreck
of
genius
by
cutting
away
the
rude
block
and
removing
the
rubbish
from
around
it
the
idol
may
be
effectually
exposed
to
view
placed
on
its
pedestal
of
pride
without
any
other
assistance
this
method
is
more
inexcusable
than
the
other
for
there
is
no
egotism
or
vanity
so
hateful
as
that
which
strikes
at
our
satisfaction
in
everything
else
and
derives
its
nourishment
from
preying
like
the
vampire
on
the
carcase
of
others
reputation
i
would
rather
in
a
word
that
a
man
should
talk
for
ever
of
himself
with
vapid
senseless
assurance
than
preserve
a
malignant
heartless
silence
when
the
merit
of
a
rival
is
mentioned
i
have
seen
instances
of
both
and
can
judge
pretty
well
between
them
there
is
no
great
harm
in
putting
forward
one
own
pretensions
of
whatever
kind
if
this
does
not
bear
a
sour
malignant
aspect
towards
others
every
one
sets
himself
off
to
the
best
advantage
he
can
and
tries
to
steal
a
march
upon
public
opinion
in
this
sense
too
the
world
a
stage
and
all
the
men
and
women
merely
players
life
itself
is
a
piece
of
harmless
quackery
a
great
house
over
your
head
is
of
no
use
but
to
announce
the
great
man
within
dress
equipage
title
are
only
so
many
quack
advertisements
and
assumptions
of
the
question
of
merit
the
star
that
glitters
at
the
breast
would
be
worth
nothing
but
as
a
badge
of
personal
distinction
and
the
crown
itself
is
but
a
symbol
of
the
virtues
which
the
possessor
inherits
from
a
long
line
of
illustrious
ancestors
how
much
honour
and
honesty
have
been
forfeited
to
be
graced
with
a
title
or
a
ribbon
how
much
genius
and
worth
have
sunk
to
the
grave
without
an
escutcheon
and
without
an
epitaph
as
men
of
rank
and
fortune
keep
lackeys
to
reinforce
their
claims
to
so
men
of
genius
sometimes
surround
themselves
with
a
coterie
of
admirers
to
increase
their
reputation
with
the
public
these
or
satellites
repeat
all
their
good
things
laugh
loud
at
all
their
jokes
and
remember
all
their
oracular
decrees
they
are
their
shadows
and
echoes
they
talk
of
them
in
all
companies
and
bring
back
word
of
all
that
has
been
said
about
them
they
hawk
the
good
qualities
of
their
patrons
as
shopmen
and
tease
you
to
buy
goods
i
have
no
notion
of
this
vanity
at
nor
can
i
see
how
this
servile
testimony
from
inferiors
followers
of
mine
own
can
be
a
proof
of
merit
it
may
soothe
the
ear
but
that
it
should
impose
on
the
understanding
i
own
surprises
me
yet
there
are
persons
who
can
not
exist
without
a
of
this
kind
about
them
in
which
they
smiling
read
the
opinion
of
the
world
in
the
midst
of
all
sorts
of
rancorous
abuse
and
hostility
as
otho
called
for
his
mirror
in
the
illyrian
field
one
good
thing
is
that
this
evil
in
some
degree
cures
itself
and
when
a
man
has
been
nearly
ruined
by
a
herd
of
these
sycophants
he
finds
them
leaving
him
like
thriftless
dependants
for
some
more
eligible
situation
carrying
away
with
them
all
the
tattle
they
can
pick
up
and
some
suit
of
finery
the
same
proneness
to
adulation
which
made
them
lick
the
dust
before
one
idol
makes
them
bow
as
low
to
the
rising
sun
they
are
as
lavish
of
detraction
as
they
were
prurient
with
praise
and
the
and
admirer
of
the
editor
of
the
figures
in
blackwood
train
the
man
is
a
lackey
and
it
is
of
little
consequence
whose
livery
he
wears
i
would
advise
those
who
volunteer
the
office
of
puffing
to
go
the
whole
length
of
it
no
will
do
lay
it
on
thick
and
threefold
or
not
at
all
if
you
are
once
harnessed
into
that
vehicle
it
will
be
in
vain
for
you
to
think
of
stopping
you
must
drive
to
the
devil
at
once
the
mighty
tamburlane
to
whose
car
you
are
yoked
cries
out
holloa
you
pamper
jades
of
asia
can
you
not
drive
but
twenty
miles
a
day
he
has
you
on
the
hip
for
you
have
pledged
your
taste
and
judgment
to
his
genius
never
fear
but
he
will
drive
this
wedge
if
you
are
once
screwed
into
such
a
machine
you
must
extricate
yourself
by
main
force
no
hyperboles
are
too
much
any
drawback
any
admiration
on
this
side
idolatry
is
high
treason
it
is
an
unpardonable
offence
to
say
that
the
last
production
of
your
patron
is
not
so
good
as
the
one
before
it
or
that
a
performer
shines
more
in
one
character
than
another
i
remember
once
hearing
a
player
declare
that
he
never
looked
into
any
newspapers
or
magazines
on
account
of
the
abuse
that
was
always
levelled
at
himself
in
them
though
there
were
not
less
than
three
persons
in
company
who
made
it
their
business
through
these
conduit
pipes
of
fame
to
him
up
to
the
top
of
the
compass
this
sort
of
expectation
is
a
little
one
fashionable
mode
of
acquiring
reputation
is
by
patronising
it
this
may
be
from
various
motives
real
good
nature
good
taste
vanity
or
pride
i
shall
only
speak
of
the
spurious
ones
in
this
place
the
quack
and
the
patron
are
well
met
the
house
of
the
latter
is
a
sort
of
curiosity
shop
or
where
all
sorts
of
intellectual
pretenders
and
grotesques
musical
children
arithmetical
prodigies
occult
philosophers
lecturers
apes
chemists
fiddlers
and
buffoons
are
to
be
seen
for
the
asking
and
are
shown
to
the
company
for
nothing
the
folding
doors
are
thrown
open
and
display
a
collection
that
the
world
can
not
parallel
again
there
may
be
a
few
persons
of
common
sense
and
established
reputation
nantes
in
gurgite
vasto
otherwise
it
is
a
mere
scramble
or
lottery
the
professed
encourager
of
and
letters
being
disappointed
of
the
great
names
sends
out
into
the
highways
for
the
halt
the
lame
and
the
blind
for
all
who
pretend
to
distinction
defects
and
obliquities
for
all
the
disposable
vanity
or
affectation
floating
on
the
town
in
hopes
that
among
so
many
oddities
chance
may
bring
some
jewel
or
treasure
to
his
door
which
he
may
have
the
good
fortune
to
appropriate
in
some
way
to
his
own
use
or
the
credit
of
displaying
to
others
the
art
is
to
encourage
rising
genius
to
bring
forward
doubtful
and
unnoticed
merit
you
thus
get
a
set
of
novices
and
raw
pretenders
about
you
whose
actual
productions
do
not
interfere
with
your
and
whose
future
efforts
may
reflect
credit
on
your
singular
sagacity
and
faculty
for
finding
out
talent
in
the
germ
and
in
the
next
place
by
having
them
completely
in
your
power
you
are
at
liberty
to
dismiss
them
whenever
you
will
and
to
supply
the
deficiency
by
a
new
set
of
wondering
unwashed
faces
in
a
rapid
succession
an
of
children
embryo
actors
artists
poets
or
philosophers
like
unfledged
birds
they
are
hatched
nursed
and
fed
by
hand
this
gives
room
for
a
vast
deal
of
management
meddling
care
and
condescending
solicitude
but
the
instant
the
callow
brood
are
fledged
they
are
driven
from
the
nest
and
forced
to
shift
for
themselves
in
the
wide
world
one
sterling
production
decides
the
question
between
them
and
their
patrons
and
from
that
time
they
become
the
property
of
the
public
thus
a
succession
of
importunate
hungry
idle
overweening
candidates
for
fame
are
encouraged
by
these
fickle
keepers
only
to
be
betrayed
and
left
to
starve
or
beg
or
pine
in
obscurity
while
the
man
of
merit
and
respectability
is
neglected
discountenanced
and
stigmatised
because
he
will
not
lend
himself
as
a
tool
to
this
system
of
splendid
imposition
or
pamper
the
luxury
and
weaknesses
of
the
vulgar
great
when
a
young
artist
is
too
independent
to
subscribe
to
the
dogmas
of
his
superiors
or
fulfils
their
predictions
and
prognostics
of
wonderful
contingent
talent
too
soon
so
as
to
get
out
of
and
lean
on
public
opinion
for
partial
support
exceptions
are
taken
to
his
dress
dialect
or
manners
and
he
is
expelled
the
circle
with
a
character
for
ingratitude
and
treachery
none
can
procure
toleration
long
but
those
who
do
not
contradict
the
opinions
or
excite
the
jealousy
of
their
betters
one
independent
step
is
an
appeal
from
them
to
the
public
their
natural
and
hated
rivals
and
annuls
the
contract
between
them
which
implies
ostentatious
countenance
on
the
one
part
and
servile
submission
on
the
other
but
enough
of
this
the
patronage
of
men
of
talent
even
when
it
proceeds
from
vanity
is
often
carried
on
with
a
spirit
of
generosity
and
magnificence
as
long
as
these
are
in
difficulties
and
a
state
of
dependence
but
as
the
principle
of
action
in
this
case
is
a
love
of
power
the
complacency
in
the
object
of
friendly
regard
ceases
with
the
opportunity
or
necessity
for
the
same
manifest
display
of
power
and
when
the
unfortunate
is
just
coming
to
land
and
expects
a
last
helping
hand
he
is
to
his
surprise
pushed
back
in
order
that
he
may
be
saved
from
drowning
once
more
you
are
not
hailed
ashore
as
you
had
supposed
by
these
kind
friends
as
a
mutual
triumph
after
all
your
struggles
and
their
exertions
in
your
behalf
it
is
a
piece
of
presumption
in
you
to
be
seen
walking
on
you
are
required
at
the
risk
of
their
friendship
to
be
always
swimming
in
troubled
waters
that
they
may
have
the
credit
of
throwing
out
ropes
and
sending
out
lifeboats
to
you
without
ever
bringing
you
ashore
your
successes
your
reputation
which
you
think
would
please
them
as
justifying
their
good
opinion
are
coldly
received
and
looked
at
askance
because
they
remove
your
dependence
on
them
if
you
are
under
a
cloud
they
do
all
they
can
to
keep
you
there
by
their
goodwill
they
are
so
sensible
of
your
gratitude
that
they
wish
your
obligations
never
to
cease
and
take
care
you
shall
owe
no
one
else
a
good
turn
and
provided
you
are
compelled
or
contented
to
remain
always
in
poverty
obscurity
and
disgrace
they
will
continue
your
very
good
friends
and
humble
servants
to
command
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
the
tenure
of
these
indentures
is
hard
such
persons
will
wilfully
forfeit
the
gratitude
created
by
years
of
friendship
by
refusing
to
perform
the
last
act
of
kindness
that
is
likely
ever
to
be
demanded

lend
you
money
if
you
have
no
chance
of
repaying
them
will
give
you
their
good
word
if
nobody
will
believe
it
and
the
only
thing
they
do
not
forgive
is
an
attempt
or
probability
on
your
part
of
being
able
to
repay
your
obligations
there
is
something
disinterested
in
all
this
at
least
it
does
not
show
a
cowardly
or
mercenary
disposition
but
it
savours
too
much
of
arrogance
and
arbitrary
pretension
it
throws
a
damning
light
on
this
question
to
consider
who
are
mostly
the
subjects
of
the
patronage
of
the
great

in
the
habit
of
receiving
cards
of

splendid
dinners

confess
for

if
the

as
follows
from
the
elevation
of
their
rank
aided
by
pride

flattery
they
look
down
on
the

talk
about

good
old
times

wanted
to
insinuate
that
i
had
been
a
sneaking
admirer
but
could
not
bring
it
in
as
however
we
were
putting
on
our
greatcoats
downstairs
i
ventured
to
break
the
ice
by
saying

one
actor

that
period

we
have
not

mention

on
the
knowledge
of
character
it
is
astonishing
with
all
our
opportunities
and
practice
how
little
we
know
of
this
subject
for
myself
i
feel
that
the
more
i
learn
the
less
i
understand
it
i
remember
several
years
ago
a
conversation
in
the
diligence
coming
from
paris
in
which
on
its
being
mentioned
that
a
man
had
married
his
wife
after
thirteen
years
courtship
a
of
mine
observed
that
at
least
he
would
be
acquainted
with
her
character
when
a
monsieur
p
inventor
and
proprietor
of
the
girl
made
answer
not
at
all
for
that
the
very
next
day
she
might
turn
out
the
very
reverse
of
the
character
that
she
had
appeared
in
during
all
the
preceding
time
i
could
not
help
admiring
the
superior
sagacity
of
the
french
juggler
and
it
struck
me
then
that
we
could
never
be
sure
when
we
had
got
at
the
bottom
of
this
riddle
there
are
various
ways
of
getting
at
a
knowledge
of
character
by
looks
words
actions
the
first
of
these
which
seems
the
most
superficial
is
perhaps
the
safest
and
least
liable
to
deceive
nay
it
is
that
which
mankind
in
spite
of
their
pretending
to
the
contrary
most
generally
go
by
professions
pass
for
nothing
and
actions
may
be
counterfeited
but
a
man
can
not
help
his
looks
said
a
celebrated
wit
given
to
man
to
conceal
his
thoughts
yet
i
do
not
know
that
the
greatest
hypocrites
are
the
least
silent
the
mouth
of

is
pursed
up
in
the
portraits
of
him

he

lord
chesterfield
advises
us
if
we
wish
to
know
the
real
sentiments
of
the
person
we
are
conversing
with
to
look
in
his
face
for
he
can
more
easily
command
his
words
than
his
features
a
man
whole
life
may
be
picture
painted
of
him
by
a
great
artist
would
probably
stamp
his
true
character
on
the
canvas
and
betray
the
secret
to
posterity
men
opinions
were
divided
in
their
lifetimes
about
such
prominent
personages
as
charles
and
ignatius
loyola
partly
no
doubt
from
passion
and
interest
but
partly
from
contradictory
evidence
in
their
ostensible
conduct
the
spectator
who
has
ever
seen
their
pictures
by
titian
judges
of
them
at
once
and
truly
i
had
rather
leave
a
good
portrait
of
myself
behind
me
than
have
a
fine
epitaph
the
face
for
the
most
part
tells
what
we
have
thought
and
felt
the
rest
is
nothing
i
prefixed
to
his
poems
than
from
anything
he
ever
wrote
would
not
have
redeemed
him
in
my
opinion
if
the
bust
of
him
had
resembled
the
duke
of
wellington
my
old
friend
fawcett
used
to
say
that
if
sir
isaac
newton
himself
had
lisped
he
could
not
have
thought
anything
of
him
so
i
can
not
persuade
myself
that
any
one
is
a
great
man
who
looks
like
a
fool
in
this
i
may
be
wrong
first
impressions
are
often
the
truest
as
we
find
not
unfrequently
to
our
cost
when
we
have
been
wheedled
out
of
them
by
plausible
professions
or
actions
a
man
look
is
the
work
of
years
it
is
stamped
on
his
countenance
by
the
events
of
his
whole
life
nay
more
by
the
hand
of
nature
and
it
is
not
to
be
got
rid
of
easily
there
is
as
it
has
been
remarked
repeatedly
something
in
a
person
appearance
at
first
sight
which
we
do
not
like
and
that
gives
us
an
odd
twinge
but
which
is
overlooked
in
a
multiplicity
of
other
circumstances
till
the
mask
is
taken
off
and
we
see
this
lurking
character
verified
in
the
plainest
manner
in
the
sequel
we
are
struck
at
first
and
by
chance
with
what
is
peculiar
and
characteristic
also
with
permanent
and
general
effect
this
afterwards
goes
off
in
a
set
of
unmeaning
details
this
sort
of
evidence
then
shows
what
a
man
is
better
than
what
he
says
or
does
for
it
shows
us
the
habit
of
his
mind
which
is
the
same
under
all
circumstances
and
disguises
you
will
say
on
the
other
hand
that
there
is
no
judging
by
appearances
as
a
general
rule
no
one
for
instance
would
take
such
a
person
for
a
very
clever
man
without
knowing
who
he
was
then
ten
to
one
he
is
not
he
may
have
got
the
reputation
but
it
is
a
mistake
you
say
there
is
undoubtedly
a
person
of
great
genius
yet
except
when
excited
by
something
extraordinary
he
seems
half
dead
he
has
wit
at
will
yet
wants
life
and
spirit
he
is
capable
of
the
most
generous
acts
yet
meanness
seems
to
cling
to
every
motion
he
looks
like
a
poor
creature
and
in
truth
he
is
one
the
first
impression
he
gives
you
of
him
answers
nearly
to
the
feeling
he
has
of
his
personal
identity
and
this
image
of
himself
rising
from
his
thoughts
and
shrouding
his
faculties
is
that
which
sits
with
him
in
the
house
walks
out
with
him
into
the
street
and
haunts
his
bedside
the
best
part
of
his
existence
is
dull
cloudy
leaden
the
flashes
of
light
that
proceed
from
it
or
streak
it
here
and
there
may
dazzle
others
but
do
not
deceive
himse
deficiency
it
indicates
he
who
undervalues
himself
is
justly
undervalued
by
others
whatever
good
properties
he
may
possess
are
in
fact
neutralised
by
a
rheum
running
through
his
veins
and
taking
away
the
zest
of
his
pretensions
the
pith
and
marrow
of
his
performances
what
is
it
to
me
that
i
can
write
these
it
is
true
i
can
by
a
reluctant
effort
rake
up
a
parcel
of
observations
but
they
do
not
float
on
the
surface
of
my
mind
nor
stir
it
with
any
sense
of
pleasure
nor
even
of
pride
others
have
more
property
in
them
than
i
have
they
may
reap
the
benefit
i
have
only
had
the
pain
otherwise
they
are
to
me
as
if
they
had
never
existed
nor
should
i
know
that
i
had
ever
thought
at
all
but
that
i
am
reminded
of
it
by
the
strangeness
of
my
appearance
and
my
unfitness
for
everything
else
look
in
coleridge
face
while
he
is
talking
his
words
are
such
as
might
a
soul
under
the
ribs
of
death
his
face
is
a
blank
which
are
we
to
consider
as
the
true
index
of
his
mind
pain
languor
shadowy
remembrances
are
the
uneasy
inmates
there
his
lips
move
mechanically
there
are
people
that
we
do
not
like
though
we
may
have
known
them
long
and
have
no
fault
to
find
with
them
appearance
as
we
say
is
so
much
against
them
that
is
not
all
if
we
could
find
it
out
there
is
generally
a
reason
for
this
prejudice
for
nature
is
true
to
itself
they
may
be
very
good
sort
of
people
too
in
their
way
but
still
something
is
the
matter
there
is
a
coldness
a
selfishness
a
levity
an
insincerity
which
we
can
not
fix
upon
any
particular
phrase
or
action
but
we
see
it
in
their
whole
persons
and
deportment
one
reason
that
we
do
not
see
it
in
any
other
way
may
be
that
they
are
all
the
time
trying
to
conceal
this
defect
by
every
means
in
their
power
there
is
luckily
a
sort
of
in
morals
we
discern
the
lurking
indications
of
temper
and
habit
a
long
while
before
their
palpable
effects
appear
i
once
used
to
meet
with
a
person
at
an
ordinary
a
very
civil
man
in
other
respects
but
with
an
odd
look
about
his
eyes
which
i
could
not
explain
as
if
he
saw
you
under
their
fringed
lids
and
you
could
not
see
him
again
this
man
was
a
common
sharper
the
greatest
hypocrite
i
ever
knew
was
a
little
demure
pretty
girl
with
eyes
timidly
cast
upon
the
ground
and
an
air
soft
as
enchantment
the
only
circumstance
that
could
lead
to
a
suspicion
of
her
true
character
was
a
cold
sullen
watery
glazed
look
about
the
eyes
which
she
bent
on
vacancy
as
if
determined
to
avoid
all
explanation
with
yours
i
might
have
spied
in
their
glittering
motionless
surface
the
rocks
and
quicksands
that
awaited
me
below
we
do
not
feel
quite
at
ease
in
the
company
or
friendship
of
those
who
have
any
natural
obliquity
or
imperfection
of
person
the
reason
is
they
are
not
on
the
best
terms
with
themselves
and
are
sometimes
apt
to
play
off
on
others
the
tricks
that
nature
has
played
them
this
however
is
a
remark
that
perhaps
ought
not
to
have
been
made
i
know
a
person
to
whom
it
has
been
objected
as
a
disqualification
for
friendship
that
he
never
shakes
you
cordially
by
the
hand
i
own
this
is
a
damper
to
sanguine
and
florid
temperaments
who
abound
in
these
practical
demonstrations
and
extern
the
same
person
who
testifies
the
least
pleasure
at
meeting
you
is
the
last
to
quit
his
seat
in
your
company
grapples
with
a
subject
in
conversation
right
earnestly
and
is
i
take
it
backward
to
give
up
a
cause
or
a
friend
cold
and
distant
in
appearance
he
piques
himself
on
being
the
king
of
haters
and
a
no
less
zealous
partisan
the
most
phlegmatic
constitutions
often
contain
the
most
inflammable
spirits
a
fire
is
struck
from
the
hardest
flints
and
this
is
another
reason
that
makes
it
difficult
to
judge
of
character
extremes
meet
and
qualities
display
themselves
by
the
most
contradictory
appearances
any
inclination
in
consequence
of
being
generally
suppressed
vents
itself
the
more
violently
when
an
opportunity
presents
itself
the
greatest
grossness
sometimes
accompanies
the
greatest
refinement
as
a
natural
relief
one
to
the
other
and
we
find
the
most
reserved
and
indifferent
tempers
at
the
beginning
of
an
entertainment
or
an
acquaintance
turn
out
the
most
communicative
and
cordial
at
the
end
of
it
some
spirits
exhaust
themselves
at
first
others
gain
strength
by
progression
some
minds
have
a
greater
facility
of
throwing
off
impressions
are
as
it
were
more
transparent
or
porous
than
others
thus
the
french
present
a
marked
contrast
to
the
english
in
this
respect
a
frenchman
addresses
you
at
once
with
a
sort
of
lively
indifference
an
englishman
is
more
on
his
guard
feels
his
way
and
is
either
exceedingly
reserved
or
lets
you
into
his
whole
confidence
which
he
can
not
so
well
impart
to
an
entire
stranger
again
a
frenchman
is
naturally
humane
an
englishman
is
i
should
say
only
friendly
by
habit
his
virtues
and
his
vices
cost
him
more
than
they
do
his
more
gay
and
volatile
neighbours
an
englishman
is
said
to
speak
his
mind
more
plainly
than
others
yes
if
it
will
give
you
pain
to
hear
it
he
does
not
care
whom
he
offends
by
his
discourse
a
foreigner
generally
strives
to
oblige
in
what
he
says
the
french
are
accused
of
promising
more
than
they
perform
that
may
be
and
yet
they
may
perform
as
many
acts
as
the
english
if
the
latter
are
as
averse
to
perform
as
they
are
to
promise
even
the
professions
of
the
french
may
be
sincere
at
the
time
or
arise
out
of
the
impulse
of
the
moment
though
their
desire
to
serve
you
may
be
neither
very
violent
nor
very
lasting
i
can
not
think
notwithstanding
that
the
french
are
not
a
serious
people
nay
that
they
are
not
a
more
reflecting
people
than
the
common
run
of
the
english
let
those
who
think
them
merely
light
and
mercurial
explain
that
enigma
their
everlasting
prosing
tragedy
the
english
are
considered
as
comparatively
a
slow
plodding
people
if
the
french
are
quicker
they
are
also
more
plodding
see
for
example
how
highly
finished
and
elaborate
their
works
of
art
are
how
systematic
and
correct
they
aim
at
being
in
all
their
productions
of
a
graver
cast
the
french
have
a
fault
as
yorick
said
is
that
they
are
too
grave
with
wit
sense
cheerfulness
patience
and
refinement
of
manners
all
they
want
is
imagination
and
sturdiness
of
moral
principle
such
are
some
of
the
contradictions
in
the
character
of
the
two
nations
and
so
little
does
the
character
of
either
appear
to
have
been
understood
nothing
can
be
more
ridiculous
indeed
than
the
way
in
which
we
exaggerate
each
other
vices
and
extenuate
our
own
the
whole
is
an
affair
of
prejudice
on
one
side
of
the
question
and
of
partiality
on
the
other
travellers
who
set
out
to
carry
back
a
true
report
of
the
case
appear
to
lose
not
only
the
use
of
their
understandings
but
of
their
senses
the
instant
they
set
foot
in
a
foreign
land
the
commonest
facts
and
appearances
are
distorted
and
discoloured
they
go
abroad
with
certain
preconceived
notions
on
the
subject
and
they
make
everything
answer
in
reason
spite
to
their
favourite
theory
in
addition
to
the
difficulty
of
explaining
customs
and
manners
foreign
to
our
own
there
are
all
the
obstacles
of
wilful
prepossession
thrown
in
the
way
it
is
not
therefore
much
to
be
wondered
at
that
nations
have
arrived
at
so
little
knowledge
of
one
another
characters
and
that
where
the
object
has
been
to
widen
the
breach
between
them
any
slight
differences
that
occur
are
easily
blown
into
a
blaze
of
fury
by
repeated
misrepresentations
and
all
the
exaggerations
that
malice
or
folly
can
invent
this
ignorance
of
character
is
not
confined
to
foreign
nations
we
are
ignorant
of
that
of
our
own
countrymen
in
a
class
a
little
below
or
above
ourselves
we
shall
hardly
pretend
to
pronounce
magisterially
on
the
good
or
bad
qualities
of
strangers
and
at
the
same
time
we
are
ignorant
of
those
of
our
friends
of
our
kindred
and
of
our
own
we
are
in
all
these
cases
either
too
near
or
too
far
off
the
object
to
judge
of
it
properly
persons
for
instance
in
a
higher
or
middle
rank
of
life
know
little
or
nothing
of
the
characters
of
those
below
them
as
servants
country
people
etc
i
would
lay
it
down
in
the
first
place
as
a
general
rule
on
this
subject
that
all
uneducated
people
are
hypocrites
their
sole
business
is
to
deceive
they
conceive
themselves
in
a
state
of
hostility
with
others
and
stratagems
are
fair
in
war
the
inmates
of
the
kitchen
and
the
parlour
are
always
as
far
as
respects
their
feelings
and
intentions
towards
each
other
in
hobbes
of
nature
servants
and
others
in
that
line
of
life
have
nothing
to
exercise
their
spare
talents
for
invention
upon
but
those
about
them
their
superfluous
electrical
particles
of
wit
and
fancy
are
not
carried
off
by
those
established
and
fashionable
conductors
novels
and
romances
their
faculties
are
not
buried
in
books
but
all
alive
and
stirring
erect
and
bristling
like
a
cat
back
their
coarse
conversation
sparkles
with
wit
invention
ever
new
their
betters
try
all
they
can
to
set
themselves
up
above
them
and
they
try
all
they
can
to
pull
them
down
to
their
own
level
they
do
this
by
getting
up
a
little
comic
interlude
a
daily
domestic
homely
drama
out
of
the
odds
and
ends
of
the
family
failings
of
which
there
is
in
general
a
pretty
plentiful
supply
or
make
up
the
deficiency
of
materials
out
of
their
own
heads
they
turn
the
qualities
of
their
masters
and
mistresses
inside
out
and
any
real
kindness
or
condescension
only
sets
them
the
more
against
you
they
are
not
to
be
taken
in
that
way
they
will
not
be
baulked
in
the
spite
they
have
to
you
they
only
set
to
work
with
redoubled
alacrity
to
lessen
the
favour
or
to
blacken
your
character
they
feel
themselves
like
a
degraded
and
can
not
understand
how
the
obligations
can
be
all
on
one
side
and
the
advantages
all
on
the
other
you
can
not
come
to
equal
terms
with
them
they
reject
all
such
overtures
as
insidious
and
hollow
nor
can
you
ever
calculate
upon
their
gratitude
or
goodwill
any
more
than
if
they
were
so
many
strolling
gipsies
or
wild
indians
they
have
no
they
keep
no
faith
with
the
more
privileged
classes
they
are
in
your
power
and
they
endeavour
to
be
even
with
you
by
trick
and
cunning
by
lying
and
chicanery
in
this
they
have
nothing
to
restrain
them
their
whole
life
is
a
succession
of
shifts
excuses
and
expedients
the
love
of
truth
is
a
principle
with
those
only
who
have
made
it
their
study
who
have
applied
themselves
to
the
pursuit
of
some
art
or
science
where
the
intellect
is
severely
tasked
and
learns
by
habit
to
take
a
pride
in
and
to
set
a
just
value
on
the
correctness
of
its
conclusions
to
have
a
disinterested
regard
to
truth
the
mind
must
have
contemplated
it
in
abstract
and
remote
questions
whereas
the
ignorant
and
vulgar
are
only
conversant
with
those
things
in
which
their
own
interest
is
concerned
all
their
notions
are
local
personal
and
consequently
gross
and
selfish
they
say
whatever
comes
uppermost
turn
whatever
happens
to
their
own
account
and
invent
any
story
or
give
any
answer
that
suits
their
purposes
instead
of
being
bigoted
to
general
principles
they
trump
up
any
lie
for
the
occasion
and
the
more
of
a
it
is
the
better
they
like
it
the
more
it
is
why
so
much
the
more
of
a
they
have
no
conscience
about
the
matter
and
if
you
find
them
out
in
any
of
their
manoeuvres
are
not
ashamed
of
themselves
but
angry
with
you
if
you
remonstrate
with
them
they
laugh
in
your
face
the
only
hold
you
have
of
them
is
their
interest
you
can
but
dismiss
them
from
your
employment
and
is
no
if
they
effect
anything
like
decent
remorse
and
hope
you
will
pass
it
over
all
the
while
they
are
probably
trying
to
recover
the
wind
of
you
persons
of
liberal
knowledge
or
sentiments
have
no
kind
of
chance
in
this
sort
of
mixed
intercourse
with
these
barbarians
in
civilised
life
you
can
not
tell
by
any
signs
or
principles
what
is
passing
in
their
minds
there
is
no
common
point
of
view
between
you
you
have
not
the
same
topics
to
refer
to
the
same
language
to
express
yourself
your
interests
your
feelings
are
quite
distinct
you
take
certain
things
for
granted
as
rules
of
action
they
take
nothing
for
granted
but
their
own
ends
pick
up
all
their
knowledge
out
of
their
own
occasions
are
on
the
watch
only
for
what
they
can
catch
are
subtle
as
the
fox
for
prey
like
warlike
as
the
wolf
for
what
they
eat
they
have
indeed
a
regard
to
their
character
as
this
last
may
affect
their
livelihood
or
advancement
none
as
it
is
connected
with
a
sense
of
propriety
and
this
sets
their
and
native
talents
at
work
upon
a
double
file
of
expedients
to
bilk
their
consciences
and
salve
their
reputation
in
short
you
never
know
where
to
have
them
any
more
than
if
they
were
of
a
different
species
of
animals
and
in
trusting
to
them
you
are
sure
to
be
betrayed
and
overreached
you
have
other
things
to
mind
they
are
thinking
only
of
you
and
how
to
turn
you
to
advantage
and
is
no
maxim
here
you
can
build
nothing
on
your
own
moderation
or
on
their
false
delicacy
after
a
familiar
conversation
with
a
waiter
at
a
tavern
you
overhear
him
calling
you
by
some
provoking
nickname
if
you
make
a
present
to
the
daughter
of
the
house
where
you
lodge
the
mother
is
sure
to
recollect
some
addition
to
her
bill
it
is
a
running
fight
in
fact
there
is
a
principle
in
human
nature
not
willingly
to
endure
the
idea
of
a
superior
a
sour
jacobinical
disposition
to
wipe
out
the
score
of
obligation
or
efface
the
tinsel
of
external
advantages
and
where
others
have
the
opportunity
of
coming
in
contact
with
us
they
generally
find
the
means
to
establish
a
sufficiently
marked
degree
of
degrading
equality
no
man
is
a
hero
to
his
is
an
old
maxim
a
new
illustration
of
this
principle
occurred
the
other
day
while
siddons
was
giving
her
readings
of
shakespear
to
a
brilliant
and
admiring
one
of
the
servants
in
the
hall
below
was
saying
i
find
the
old
lady
is
making
as
much
noise
as
ever
so
little
is
there
in
common
between
the
different
classes
of
society
and
so
impossible
is
it
ever
to
unite
the
diversities
of
custom
and
knowledge
which
separate
them
women
according
to
peachum
are
bad
judges
of
the
characters
of
men
and
men
are
not
much
better
of
theirs
if
we
can
form
any
guess
from
their
choice
in
marriage
love
is
proverbially
blind
the
whole
is
an
affair
of
whim
and
fancy
certain
it
is
that
the
greatest
favourites
with
the
other
sex
are
not
those
who
are
most
liked
or
respected
among
their
own
i
never
knew
but
one
clever
man
who
was
what
is
called
a
man
and
he
unfortunately
for
the
argument
happened
to
be
a
considerable
coxcomb
it
was
by
this
irresistible
quality
and
not
by
the
force
of
his
genius
that
he
vanquished
women
seem
to
doubt
their
own
judgments
in
love
and
to
take
the
opinion
which
a
man
entertains
of
his
own
prowess
and
accomplishments
for
granted
the
wives
of
poets
are
for
the
most
part
mere
pieces
of
furniture
in
the
room
if
you
speak
to
them
of
their
husbands
talents
or
reputation
in
the
world
it
is
as
if
you
made
mention
of
some
office
that
they
held
it
can
hardly
be
otherwise
when
the
instant
any
subject
is
started
or
conversation
arises
in
which
men
are
interested
or
try
one
strength
the
women
leave
the
room
or
attend
to
something
else
the
qualities
then
in
which
men
are
ambitious
to
excel
and
which
ensure
the
applause
of
the
world
eloquence
genius
learning
integrity
are
not
those
which
gain
the
favour
of
the
fair
i
must
not
deny
however
that
wit
and
courage
have
this
effect
neither
is
youth
or
beauty
the
sole
passport
to
their
affections
the
way
of
woman
will
is
hard
to
find
harder
to
hit
yet
there
is
some
clue
to
this
mystery
some
determining
cause
for
we
find
that
the
same
men
are
universal
favourites
with
women
as
others
are
uniformly
disliked
by
them
is
not
the
loadstone
that
attracts
so
powerfully
and
in
all
circumstances
a
strong
and
undisguised
bias
towards
them
a
marked
attention
a
conscious
preference
of
them
to
every
other
passing
object
or
topic
i
am
not
sure
but
i
incline
to
think
so
the
successful
lover
is
the
of
all
nations
the
man
of
gallantry
behaves
as
if
he
had
made
an
assignation
with
every
woman
he
addresses
an
argument
immediately
draws
off
my
attention
from
the
prettiest
woman
in
the
room
i
accordingly
succeed
better
in
argument
than
in
love
i
do
not
think
that
what
is
called
at
first
is
so
great
an
absurdity
as
it
is
sometimes
imagined
to
be
we
generally
make
up
our
minds
beforehand
to
the
sort
of
person
we
should
like
grave
or
gay
black
brown
or
fair
with
golden
tresses
or
with
raven
locks
and
when
we
meet
with
a
complete
example
of
the
qualities
we
admire
the
bargain
is
soon
struck
we
have
never
seen
anything
to
come
up
to
our
goddess
before
but
she
is
what
we
have
been
all
our
lives
looking
for
the
idol
we
fall
down
and
worship
is
an
image
familiar
to
our
minds
it
has
been
present
to
our
waking
thoughts
it
has
haunted
us
in
our
dreams
like
some
fairy
vision
oh
thou
who
the
first
time
i
over
beheld
thee
didst
draw
my
soul
into
the
circle
of
thy
heavenly
looks
and
wave
enchantment
round
me
do
not
think
thy
conquest
less
complete
because
it
was
instantaneous
for
in
that
gentle
form
as
if
another
imogen
had
entered
i
saw
all
that
i
had
ever
loved
of
female
grace
modesty
and
sweetness
i
shall
not
say
much
of
friendship
as
giving
an
insight
into
character
because
it
is
often
founded
on
mutual
infirmities
and
prejudices
friendships
are
frequently
taken
up
on
some
sudden
sympathy
and
we
see
only
as
much
as
we
please
of
one
another
characters
afterwards
intimate
friends
are
not
fair
witnesses
to
character
any
more
than
professed
enemies
they
cool
indeed
in
time
part
and
retain
only
a
rankling
grudge
of
past
errors
and
oversights
their
testimony
in
the
latter
case
is
not
quite
free
from
suspicion
one
would
think
that
near
relations
who
live
constantly
together
and
always
have
done
so
must
be
pretty
well
acquainted
with
one
characters
they
are
nearly
in
the
dark
about
it
familiarity
confounds
all
traits
of
distinction
interest
and
prejudice
take
away
the
power
of
judging
we
have
no
opinion
on
the
subject
any
more
than
of
one
another
faces
the
penates
the
household
gods
are
veiled
we
do
not
see
the
features
of
those
we
love
nor
do
we
clearly
distinguish
their
virtues
or
their
vices
we
take
them
as
they
are
found
in
the
lump
by
weight
and
not
by
measure
we
know
all
about
the
individuals
their
sentiments
history
manners
words
actions
everything
but
we
know
all
these
too
much
as
facts
as
inveterate
habitual
impressions
as
clothed
with
too
many
associations
as
sanctified
with
too
many
affections
as
woven
too
much
into
the
web
of
our
hearts
to
be
able
to
pick
out
the
different
threads
to
cast
up
the
items
of
the
debtor
and
creditor
account
or
to
refer
them
to
any
general
standard
of
right
and
wrong
our
impressions
with
respect
to
them
are
too
strong
too
real
too
much
generis
to
be
capable
of
a
comparison
with
anything
but
themselves
we
hardly
inquire
whether
those
for
whom
we
are
thus
interested
and
to
whom
we
are
thus
knit
are
or
than
others
the
question
is
a
kind
of
profanation
all
we
know
is
they
are
to
us
than
any
one
else
can
be
our
sentiments
of
this
kind
are
rooted
and
grow
in
us
and
we
can
not
eradicate
them
by
voluntary
means
besides
our
judgments
are
bespoke
our
interests
take
part
with
our
blood
if
any
doubt
arises
if
the
veil
of
our
implicit
confidence
is
drawn
aside
by
any
accident
for
a
moment
the
shock
is
too
great
like
that
of
a
dislocated
limb
and
we
recoil
on
our
habitual
impressions
again
let
not
that
veil
ever
be
rent
entirely
asunder
so
that
those
images
may
be
left
bare
of
reverential
awe
and
lose
their
religion
for
nothing
can
ever
support
the
desolation
of
the
heart
afterwards
the
greatest
misfortune
that
can
happen
among
relations
is
a
different
way
of
bringing
up
so
as
to
set
one
another
opinions
and
characters
in
an
entirely
new
point
of
view
this
often
lets
in
an
unwelcome
daylight
on
the
subject
and
breeds
schisms
coldness
and
incurable
in
families
i
have
sometimes
thought
whether
the
progress
of
society
and
march
of
knowledge
does
not
do
more
harm
in
this
respect
by
loosening
the
ties
of
domestic
attachment
and
preventing
those
who
are
most
interested
in
and
anxious
to
think
well
of
one
another
from
feeling
a
cordial
sympathy
and
approbation
of
each
other
sentiments
manners
views
than
it
does
good
by
any
real
advantage
to
the
community
at
large
the
son
for
instance
is
brought
up
to
the
church
and
nothing
can
exceed
the
pride
and
pleasure
the
father
takes
in
him
while
all
goes
on
well
in
this
favourite
direction
his
notions
change
and
he
imbibes
a
taste
for
the
fine
arts
from
this
moment
there
is
an
end
of
anything
like
the
same
unreserved
communication
between
them
the
young
man
may
talk
with
enthusiasm
of
his
correggios
and
stuff
it
is
all
to
the
elder
and
whatever
satisfaction
he
may
feel
in
the
hearing
of
his
progress
or
good
wishes
for
his
success
he
is
never
reconciled
to
the
new
pursuit
he
still
hankers
after
the
first
object
that
he
had
set
his
mind
upon
again
the
grandfather
is
a
calvinist
who
never
gets
the
better
of
his
disappointment
at
his
son
going
over
to
the
unitarian
side
of
the
question
the
matter
rests
here
till
the
grandson
some
years
after
in
the
fashion
of
the
day
and
agitation
of
wit
comes
to
doubt
certain
points
in
the
creed
in
which
he
has
been
brought
up
and
the
affair
is
all
abroad
again
here
are
three
generations
made
uncomfortable
and
in
a
manner
set
at
variance
by
a
veering
point
of
theology
and
the
officious
meddling
biblical
critics
nothing
on
the
other
hand
can
be
more
wretched
or
common
than
that
upstart
pride
and
insolent
good
fortune
which
is
ashamed
of
its
origin
nor
are
there
many
things
more
awkward
than
the
situation
of
rich
and
poor
relations
happy
much
happier
are
those
tribes
and
people
who
are
confined
to
the
same
and
way
of
life
from
sire
to
son
where
prejudices
are
transmitted
like
instincts
and
where
the
same
unvarying
standard
of
opinion
and
refinement
blends
countless
generations
in
its
improgressive
everlasting
mould
not
only
is
there
a
wilful
and
habitual
blindness
in
near
kindred
to
each
other
defects
but
an
incapacity
to
judge
from
the
quantity
of
materials
from
the
contradictoriness
of
the
evidence
the
chain
of
particulars
is
too
long
and
massy
for
us
to
lift
it
or
put
it
into
the
most
approved
ethical
scales
the
concrete
result
does
not
answer
to
any
abstract
theory
to
any
logical
definition
there
is
black
and
white
and
grey
square
and
round
there
are
too
many
anomalies
too
many
redeeming
points
in
poor
human
nature
such
as
it
actually
is
for
us
to
arrive
at
a
smart
summary
decision
on
it
we
know
too
much
to
come
to
any
hasty
or
partial
conclusion
we
do
not
pronounce
upon
the
present
act
because
a
hundred
others
rise
up
to
contradict
it
we
suspend
our
judgments
altogether
because
in
effect
one
thing
unconsciously
balances
another
and
perhaps
this
obstinate
pertinacious
indecision
would
be
the
truest
philosophy
in
other
cases
where
we
dispose
of
the
question
of
character
easily
because
we
have
only
the
smallest
part
of
the
evidence
to
decide
upon
real
character
is
not
one
thing
but
a
thousand
things
actual
qualities
do
not
conform
to
any
factitious
standard
in
the
mind
but
rest
upon
their
own
truth
and
nature
the
dull
stupor
under
which
we
labour
in
respect
of
those
whom
we
have
the
greatest
opportunities
of
inspecting
nearly
we
should
do
well
to
imitate
before
we
give
extreme
and
uncharitable
verdicts
against
those
whom
we
only
see
in
passing
or
at
a
distance
if
we
knew
them
better
we
should
be
disposed
to
say
less
about
them
in
the
truth
of
things
there
are
none
utterly
worthless
none
without
some
drawback
on
their
pretensions
or
some
alloy
of
imperfection
it
has
been
observed
that
a
familiarity
with
the
worst
characters
lessens
our
abhorrence
of
them
and
a
wonder
is
often
expressed
that
the
greatest
criminals
look
like
other
men
the
reason
is
that
are
like
other
men
in
many
if
a
particular
individual
was
merely
the
wretch
we
read
of
or
conceive
in
the
abstract
that
is
if
he
was
the
mere
personified
idea
of
the
criminal
brought
to
the
bar
he
would
not
disappoint
the
spectator
but
would
look
like
what
he
would
be
a
monster
but
he
has
other
qualities
ideas
feelings
nay
probably
virtues
mixed
up
with
the
most
profligate
habits
or
desperate
acts
this
need
not
lessen
our
abhorrence
of
the
crime
though
it
does
of
the
criminal
for
it
has
the
latter
effect
only
by
showing
him
to
us
in
different
points
of
view
in
which
he
appears
a
common
mortal
and
not
the
caricature
of
vice
we
took
him
for
or
spotted
all
over
with
infamy
i
do
not
at
the
same
time
think
this
is
a
lax
or
dangerous
though
it
is
a
charitable
view
of
the
subject
in
my
opinion
no
man
ever
answered
in
his
own
mind
except
in
the
agonies
of
conscience
or
of
repentance
in
which
latter
case
he
throws
the
imputation
from
himself
in
another
way
to
the
abstract
idea
of
a
he
may
have
killed
a
man
in
or
the
trade
of
war
or
to
save
himself
from
starving
or
in
revenge
for
an
injury
but
always
as
with
a
difference
or
from
mixed
and
questionable
motives
the
individual
in
reckoning
with
himself
always
takes
into
the
account
the
considerations
of
time
place
and
circumstance
and
never
makes
out
a
case
of
unmitigated
unprovoked
villainy
of
defecated
evil
against
himself
there
are
degrees
in
real
crimes
we
reason
and
moralise
only
by
names
and
in
classes
i
should
be
loth
indeed
to
say
that
is
is
right
but
almost
every
actual
choice
inclines
to
it
with
some
sort
of
imperfect
unconscious
bias
this
is
the
reason
besides
the
ends
of
secrecy
of
the
invention
of
terms
for
different
acts
of
profligacy
committed
by
thieves
pickpockets
etc
the
common
names
suggest
associations
of
disgust
in
the
minds
of
others
which
those
who
live
by
them
do
not
willingly
recognise
and
which
they
wish
to
sink
in
a
technical
phraseology
so
there
is
a
story
of
a
fellow
who
as
he
was
writing
down
his
confession
of
a
murder
stopped
to
ask
how
the
word
was
spelt
this
if
true
was
partly
because
his
imagination
was
staggered
by
the
recollection
of
the
thing
and
partly
because
he
shrunk
from
the
verbal
admission
of
it
stuck
in
his
throat
the
defence
made
by
eugene
aram
of
himself
against
a
charge
of
murder
some
years
before
shows
that
he
in
imagination
completely
flung
from
himself
the
crime
imputed
to
him
he
might
indeed
have
staggered
an
old
man
with
a
blow
and
buried
his
body
in
a
cave
and
lived
ever
since
upon
the
money
he
found
upon
him
but
there
was
malice
in
the
case
none
at
all
as
peachum
says
the
very
coolness
subtlety
and
circumspection
of
his
defence
as
masterly
a
legal
document
as
there
is
upon
record
prove
that
he
was
guilty
of
the
act
as
much
as
they
prove
that
he
was
unconscious
of
the
in
the
same
spirit
and
i
conceive
with
great
metaphysical
truth
coleridge
in
his
tragedy
of
makes
ordonio
his
chief
character
wave
the
acknowledgment
of
his
meditated
guilt
to
his
own
mind
by
putting
into
his
mouth
that
striking
soliloquy
say
i
had
lay
a
body
in
the
sun
well
in
a
month
there
swarm
forth
from
the
corse
a
thousand
nay
ten
thousand
sentient
beings
in
place
of
that
one
man
say
i
had
him
yet
who
shall
tell
me
that
each
one
and
all
of
these
ten
thousand
lives
is
not
as
happy
as
that
one
life
which
being
push
aside
made
room
for
these
act
ii
sc
i
am
not
sure
indeed
that
i
have
not
got
this
whole
train
of
speculation
from
him
but
i
should
not
think
the
worse
of
it
on
that
account
that
gentleman
i
recollect
once
asked
me
whether
i
thought
that
the
different
members
of
a
family
really
liked
one
another
so
well
or
had
so
much
attachment
as
was
generally
supposed
and
i
said
that
i
conceived
the
regard
they
had
towards
each
other
was
expressed
by
the
word
rather
than
by
any
other
which
he
said
was
the
true
answer
i
do
not
know
that
i
could
mend
it
now
natural
affection
is
not
pleasure
in
one
another
company
nor
admiration
of
one
qualities
but
it
is
an
intimate
and
deep
knowledge
of
the
things
that
affect
those
to
whom
we
are
bound
by
the
nearest
ties
with
pleasure
or
pain
it
is
an
anxious
uneasy
with
them
a
jealous
watchfulness
over
their
good
name
a
tender
and
unconquerable
yearning
for
their
good
the
love
in
short
we
bear
them
is
the
nearest
to
that
we
bear
ourselves
according
to
the
old
saying
home
be
it
never
so
we
love
ourselves
not
according
to
our
deserts
but
our
cravings
after
good
so
we
love
our
immediate
relations
in
the
next
degree
if
not
even
sometimes
a
higher
one
because
we
know
best
what
they
have
suffered
and
what
sits
nearest
to
their
hearts
we
are
implicated
in
fact
in
their
welfare
by
habit
and
sympathy
as
we
are
in
our
own
if
our
devotion
to
our
own
interests
is
much
the
same
as
to
theirs
we
are
ignorant
of
our
own
characters
for
the
same
reason
we
are
parties
too
much
concerned
to
return
a
fair
verdict
and
are
too
much
in
the
secret
of
our
own
motives
or
situation
not
to
be
able
to
give
a
favourable
turn
to
our
actions
we
exercise
a
liberal
criticism
upon
ourselves
and
put
off
the
final
decision
to
a
late
day
the
field
is
large
and
open
hamlet
exclaims
with
a
noble
magnanimity
count
myself
indifferent
honest
and
yet
i
could
accuse
me
of
such
things
if
you
could
prove
to
a
man
that
he
is
a
knave
it
would
not
make
much
difference
in
his
opinion
his
is
stronger
than
his
love
of
virtue
hypocrisy
is
generally
used
as
a
mask
to
deceive
the
world
not
to
impose
on
ourselves
for
once
detect
the
delinquent
in
his
knavery
and
he

this
at

happens

where
there
is
a
contradiction
in

our
vices
are
involuntary
and
at
variance
with
our
convictions
one
great
difficulty
is
to
distinguish
ostensible
motives
or
such
as
we
acknowledge
to
ourselves
from
tacit
or
secret
springs
of
action
a
man
changes
his
opinion
readily
he
thinks

it
is
levity

are
callous
by

to
our
defects
or
excellences

where
vanity
steps
in
to
exaggerate
or
extenuate
them

can
not
conceive
how
it
is
that
people
are
in
love
with
their
own
persons
or
astonished
at
their
own
performances
which
are
but
a
nine
days
wonder
to
every
one
else
in
general
it
may
be
laid
down
that
we
are
liable
to
this
twofold
mistake
in
judging
of
our
own
talents
we
in
the
first
place
nurse
the
rickety
bantling
we
think
much
of
that
which
has
cost
us
much
pains
and
labour
and
comes
against
the
grain
and
we
also
set
little
store
by
what
we
do
with
most
ease
to
ourselves
and
therefore
best
the
works
of
the
greatest
genius
are
produced
almost
unconsciously
with
an
ignorance
on
the
part
of
the
persons
themselves
that
they
have
done
anything
extraordinary
nature
has
done
it
for
them
how
little
shakespear
seems
to
have
thought
of
himself
or
of
his
fame
yet
if
know
another
well
were
to
know
one
self
he
must
have
been
acquainted
with
his
own
pretensions
and
character
knew
all
qualities
with
a
learned
spirit
his
eye
seems
never
to
have
been
bent
upon
himself
but
outwards
upon
nature
a
man
who
thinks
highly
of
himself
may
almost
set
it
down
that
it
is
without
reason
milton
notwithstanding
appears
to
have
had
a
high
opinion
of
himself
and
to
have
made
it
good
he
was
conscious
of
his
powers
and
great
by
design
perhaps
his
tenaciousness
on
the
score
of
his
own
merit
might
arise
from
an
early
habit
of
polemical
writing
in
which
his
pretensions
were
continually
called
to
the
bar
of
prejudice
and
and
he
had
to
plead
not
guilty
to
the
indictment
some
men
have
died
unconscious
of
immortality
as
others
have
almost
exhausted
the
sense
of
it
in
their
lifetimes

be
mentioned
as

of
the

of

is
nothing
that

in
his

more
than

his

there
is

to

his

are
thus

are
those
who
have
gone
for

strangely
out
of
their
way
and
others
who
have
never

we
find
many
who
succeed
in
certain
departments

are

melancholy

failed

will
conclude
with
observing
that
authors
in
general
overrate
the
extent
and
value
of
posthumous
fame
for
what
as
it
has
been
asked
is
the
amount
even
of
shakespear

in

on
the
picturesque
and
ideal
a
fragment
the
natural
in
visible
objects
is
whatever
is
ordinarily
presented
to
the
senses
the
picturesque
is
that
which
stands
out
and
catches
the
attention
by
some
striking
peculiarity
the
is
that
which
answers
to
the
preconceived
imagination
and
appetite
in
the
mind
for
love
and
beauty
the
picturesque
depends
chiefly
on
the
principle
of
discrimination
or
contrast
the
on
harmony
and
continuity
of
effect
the
one
surprises
the
other
satisfies
the
mind
the
one
starts
off
from
a
given
point
the
other
reposes
on
itself
the
one
is
determined
by
an
excess
of
form
the
other
by
a
concentration
of
feeling
the
picturesque
may
be
considered
as
something
like
an
excrescence
on
the
face
of
nature
it
runs
imperceptibly
into
the
fantastical
and
grotesque
fairies
and
satyrs
are
picturesque
but
they
are
scarcely
they
are
an
extreme
and
unique
conception
of
a
certain
thing
but
not
of
what
the
mind
delights
in
or
broods
fondly
over
the
image
created
by
the
artist
hand
is
not
moulded
and
fashioned
by
the
love
of
good
and
yearning
after
grace
and
beauty
but
rather
the
contrary
that
is
they
are
ideal
deformity
not
ideal
beauty
rubens
was
perhaps
the
most
picturesque
of
painters
but
he
was
almost
the
least
so
rembrandt
was
out
of
sight
the
most
picturesque
of
colourists
as
correggio
was
the
most
in
other
words
his
composition
of
light
and
shade
is
more
a
whole
more
in
unison
more
blended
into
the
same
harmonious
feeling
than
rembrandt
who
staggers
by
contrast
but
does
not
soothe
by
gradation
correggio
forms
indeed
had
a
picturesque
air
for
they
often
incline
even
when
most
beautiful
to
the
quaintness
of
caricature
vandyke
i
think
was
at
once
the
least
picturesque
and
least
of
all
the
great
painters
he
was
purely
natural
and
neither
selected
from
outward
forms
nor
added
anything
from
his
own
mind
he
owes
everything
to
perfect
truth
clearness
and
transparency
and
though
his
productions
certainly
arrest
the
eye
and
strike
in
a
room
full
of
pictures
it
is
from
the
contrast
they
present
to
other
pictures
and
from
being
stripped
quite
naked
of
all
artificial
advantages
they
strike
almost
as
a
piece
of
white
paper
would
hung
up
in
the
same
situation
i
began
with
saying
that
whatever
stands
out
from
a
given
line
and
as
it
were
projects
upon
the
eye
is
picturesque
and
this
holds
true
comparatively
in
form
and
colour
a
rough
terrier
dog
with
the
hair
bristled
and
matted
together
is
picturesque
as
we
say
there
is
a
decided
character
in
it
a
marked
determination
to
an
extreme
point
a
is
odd
and
disagreeable
but
there
is
nothing
picturesque
in
its
appearance
it
is
a
mere
mass
of
flimsy
confusion
a
goat
with
projecting
horns
and
pendent
beard
is
a
picturesque
animal
a
sheep
is
not
a
horse
is
only
picturesque
from
opposition
of
colour
as
in
northcote
study
of
gadshill
where
the
white
horse
head
coming
against
the
dark
scowling
face
of
the
man
makes
as
fine
a
contrast
as
can
be
imagined
an
old
stump
of
a
tree
with
rugged
bark
and
one
or
two
straggling
branches
a
little
stunted
line
marking
the
boundary
of
the
horizon
a
a
winding
path
a
rock
seen
against
the
sky
are
picturesque
because
they
have
all
of
them
prominence
and
a
distinctive
character
of
their
own
they
are
not
objects
to
borrow
shakespear
phrase
no
mark
or
likelihood
a
country
may
be
beautiful
romantic
or
sublime
without
being
picturesque
the
lakes
in
the
north
of
england
are
not
picturesque
though
certainly
the
most
interesting
sight
in
this
country
to
be
a
subject
for
painting
a
prospect
must
present
sharp
striking
points
of
view
or
singular
forms
or
one
object
must
relieve
and
set
off
another
there
must
be
distinct
stages
and
salient
points
for
the
eye
to
rest
upon
or
start
from
in
its
progress
over
the
expanse
before
it
the
distance
of
a
landscape
will
oftentimes
look
flat
or
heavy
that
the
trunk
of
a
tree
or
a
ruin
in
the
foreground
would
immediately
throw
into
perspective
and
turn
to
air
rembrandt
landscapes
are
the
least
picturesque
in
the
world
except
from
the
straight
lines
and
sharp
angles
the
deep
incision
and
dragging
of
his
pencil
like
a
harrow
over
the
ground
and
the
broad
contrast
of
earth
and
sky
earth
in
his
copies
is
rough
and
hairy
and
pan
has
struck
his
hoof
against
it
a
camel
is
a
picturesque
ornament
in
a
landscape
or
this
is
not
merely
from
its
romantic
and
oriental
character
for
an
elephant
has
not
the
same
effect
and
if
introduced
as
a
necessary
appendage
is
also
an
unwieldy
incumbrance
a
negro
head
in
a
group
is
picturesque
from
contrast
so
are
the
spots
on
a
panther
hide
this
was
the
principle
that
paul
veronese
went
upon
who
said
the
rule
for
composition
was
upon
white
and
while
upon
he
was
a
pretty
good
judge
his
celebrated
picture
of
the
marriage
of
cana
is
in
all
likelihood
the
completest
piece
of
workmanship
extant
in
the
art
when
i
saw
it
it
nearly
covered
one
side
of
a
large
room
in
the
louvre
being
itself
forty
feet
by
twenty
and
it
seemed
as
if
that
side
of
the
apartment
was
thrown
open
and
you
looked
out
at
the
open
sky
at
buildings
marble
pillars
galleries
with
people
in
them
emperors
female
slaves
turks
negroes
musicians
all
the
famous
painters
of
the
time
the
tables
loaded
with
viands
goblets
and
dogs
under
them
a
sparkling
overwhelming
confusion
a
bright
unexpected
reality
the
only
fault
you
could
find
was
that
no
miracle
was
going
on
in
the
faces
of
the
spectators
the
only
miracle
there
was
the
picture
itself
a
french
gentleman
who
showed
me
this
of
painting
as
it
has
been
called
perceiving
i
was
struck
with
it
observed
wife
admires
it
exceedingly
for
the
facility
of
the
execution
i
took
this
proof
of
sympathy
for
a
compliment
it
is
said
that
when
humboldt
the
celebrated
traveller
and
naturalist
was
introduced
to
buonaparte
the
emperor
addressed
him
in
these
words
aimez
la
botanique
and
on
the
other
replying
in
the
affirmative
added
ma
femme
aussi
this
has
been
found
fault
with
as
a
piece
of
brutality
and
insolence
in
the
great
man
by
bigoted
critics
who
do
not
know
what
a
thing
it
is
to
get
a
frenchwoman
to
agree
with
them
in
any
point
for
my
part
i
took
the
observation
as
it
was
meant
and
it
did
not
put
me
out
of
conceit
with
myself
or
the
picture
that
madame
m
liked
it
as
well
as
certainly
there
could
be
no
harm
in
that
by
the
side
of
it
happened
to
be
hung
two
allegorical
pictures
of
rubens
and
in
such
matters
he
too
was
baby
i
do
remember
what
the
figures
were
but
the
texture
seemed
of
wool
or
cotton
the
texture
of
the
paul
veronese
was
not
wool
or
cotton
but
stuff
jewels
flesh
marble
air
whatever
composed
the
essence
of
the
varied
subjects
in
endless
relief
and
truth
of
handling
if
the
fleming
had
seen
his
two
allegories
hanging
where
they
did
he
would
without
a
question
have
wished
them
far
enough
i
imagine
that
rubens
landscapes
are
picturesque
claude
are
rubens
is
always
in
extremes
claude
in
the
middle
rubens
carries
some
one
peculiar
quality
or
feature
of
nature
to
the
utmost
verge
of
probability
claude
balances
and
harmonises
different
forms
and
masses
with
laboured
delicacy
so
that
nothing
falls
short
no
one
thing
overpowers
another
rainbows
showers
partial
gleams
of
sunshine
moonlight
are
the
means
with
which
rubens
produces
his
most
gorgeous
and
enchanting
effects
there
are
neither
rainbows
nor
showers
nor
sudden
bursts
of
sunshine
nor
glittering
moonbeams
in
claude
he
is
all
softness
and
proportion
the
other
is
all
spirit
and
brilliant
excess
the
two
sides
for
example
of
one
of
claude
landscapes
balance
one
another
as
in
a
scale
of
beauty
in
rubens
the
several
objects
are
grouped
and
thrown
together
with
capricious
wantonness
claude
has
more
repose
rubens
more
gaiety
and
extravagance
and
here
it
might
be
asked
is
a
rainbow
a
picturesque
or
an
object
it
seems
to
me
to
be
both
it
is
an
accident
in
nature
but
it
is
an
inmate
of
the
fancy
it
startles
and
surprises
the
sense
but
it
soothes
and
tranquillises
the
spirit
it
makes
the
eye
glisten
to
behold
it
but
the
mind
turns
to
it
long
after
it
has
faded
from
its
place
in
the
sky
it
has
both
properties
then
of
giving
an
extraordinary
impulse
to
the
mind
by
the
singularity
of
its
appearance
and
of
riveting
the
imagination
by
its
intense
beauty
i
may
just
notice
here
in
passing
that
i
think
the
effect
of
moonlight
is
treated
in
an
manner
in
the
line
in
shakespear
see
how
the
moonlight
upon
yon
bank
the
image
is
heightened
by
the
exquisiteness
of
the
expression
beyond
its
natural
beauty
and
it
seems
as
if
there
could
be
no
end
to
the
delight
taken
in
a
number
of
sheep
coming
to
a
pool
of
water
to
drink
with
shady
trees
in
the
background
the
rest
of
the
flock
following
them
and
the
shepherd
and
his
dog
left
carelessly
behind
is
surely
the
in
if
the
has
its
source
in
the
interest
excited
by
a
subject
in
its
power
of
drawing
the
affections
after
it
linked
in
a
golden
chain
and
in
the
desire
of
the
mind
to
dwell
on
it
for
ever
the
in
a
word
is
the
height
of
the
pleasing
that
which
satisfies
and
accords
with
the
inmost
longing
of
the
soul
the
picturesque
is
merely
a
sharper
and
bolder
impression
of
reality
a
morning
mist
drawing
a
slender
veil
over
all
objects
is
at
once
picturesque
and
for
it
in
the
first
place
excites
immediate
surprise
and
admiration
and
in
the
next
a
wish
for
it
to
continue
and
a
fear
lest
it
should
be
too
soon
dissipated
is
the
cupid
riding
on
a
lion
in
the
ceiling
at
whitehall
and
urging
him
with
a
spear
over
a
precipice
with
only
clouds
and
sky
beyond
most
picturesque
or
it
has
every
effect
of
startling
contrast
and
situation
and
yet
inspires
breathless
expectation
and
wonder

xvii
on
the
fear
of
death
and
our
little
life
is
rounded
with
a
sleep
perhaps
the
best
cure
for
the
fear
of
death
is
to
reflect
that
life
has
a
beginning
as
well
as
an
end
there
was
a
time
when
we
were
not
this
gives
us
no
concern
why
then
should
it
trouble
us
that
a
time
will
come
when
we
shall
cease
to
be
i
have
no
wish
to
have
been
alive
a
hundred
years
ago
or
in
the
reign
of
queen
anne
why
should
i
regret
and
lay
it
so
much
to
heart
that
i
shall
not
be
alive
a
hundred
years
hence
in
the
reign
of
i
can
not
tell
whom
when
bickerstaff
wrote
his
essays
i
knew
nothing
of
the
subjects
of
them
nay
much
later
and
but
the
other
day
as
it
were
in
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
george
when
goldsmith
johnson
burke
used
to
meet
at
the
globe
when
garrick
was
in
his
glory
and
reynolds
was
over
head
and
ears
with
his
portraits
and
sterne
brought
out
the
volumes
of
year
by
year
it
was
without
consulting
me
i
had
not
the
slightest
intimation
of
what
was
going
on
the
debates
in
the
house
of
commons
on
the
american
war
or
the
firing
at
hill
disturbed
not
me
yet
i
thought
this
no
evil
i
neither
ate
drank
nor
was
merry
yet
i
did
not
complain
i
had
not
then
looked
out
into
this
breathing
world
yet
i
was
well
and
the
world
did
quite
as
well
without
me
as
i
did
without
it
why
then
should
i
make
all
this
outcry
about
parting
with
it
and
being
no
worse
off
than
i
was
before
there
is
nothing
in
the
recollection
that
at
a
certain
time
we
were
not
come
into
the
world
that
gorge
rises
at
why
should
we
revolt
at
the
idea
that
we
must
one
day
go
out
of
it
to
die
is
only
to
be
as
we
were
before
we
were
born
yet
no
one
feels
any
remorse
or
regret
or
repugnance
in
contemplating
this
last
idea
it
is
rather
a
relief
and
disburthening
of
the
mind
it
seems
to
have
been
with
us
then
we
were
not
called
to
appear
upon
the
stage
of
life
to
wear
robes
or
tatters
to
laugh
or
cry
be
hooted
or
applauded
we
had
lain
all
this
while
snug
out
of
harm
way
and
had
slept
out
our
thousands
of
centuries
without
wanting
to
be
waked
up
at
peace
and
free
from
care
in
a
long
nonage
in
a
sleep
deeper
and
calmer
than
that
of
infancy
wrapped
in
the
softest
and
finest
dust
and
the
worst
that
we
dread
is
after
a
short
fretful
feverish
being
after
vain
hopes
and
idle
fears
to
sink
to
final
repose
again
and
forget
the
troubled
dream
of
life
ye
armed
men
knights
templars
that
sleep
in
the
stone
aisles
of
that
old
temple
church
where
all
is
silent
above
and
where
a
deeper
silence
reigns
below
not
broken
by
the
pealing
organ
are
ye
not
contented
where
ye
lie
or
would
you
come
out
of
your
long
homes
to
go
to
the
holy
war
or
do
ye
complain
that
pain
no
longer
visits
you
that
sickness
has
done
its
worst
that
you
have
paid
the
last
debt
to
nature
that
you
hear
no
more
of
the
thickening
phalanx
of
the
foe
or
your
lady
waning
love
and
that
while
this
ball
of
earth
rolls
its
eternal
round
no
sound
shall
ever
pierce
through
to
disturb
your
lasting
repose
fixed
as
the
marble
over
your
tombs
breathless
as
the
grave
that
holds
you
and
thou
oh
thou
to
whom
my
heart
turns
and
will
turn
while
it
has
feeling
left
who
didst
love
in
vain
and
whose
first
was
thy
last
sigh
wilt
not
thou
too
rest
in
peace
or
wilt
thou
cry
to
me
complaining
from
thy
bed
when
that
sad
heart
is
no
longer
sad
and
that
sorrow
is
dead
which
thou
wert
only
called
into
the
world
to
feel
it
is
certain
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
idea
of
a
state
that
excites
our
longing
like
the
prospect
of
a
posthumous
existence
we
are
satisfied
to
have
begun
life
when
we
did
we
have
no
ambition
to
have
set
out
on
our
journey
sooner
and
feel
that
we
have
had
quite
enough
to
do
to
battle
our
way
through
since
we
can
not
say
the
wars
we
well
remember
of
king
nine
of
old
assaracus
and
inachus
divine
neither
have
we
any
wish
we
are
contented
to
read
of
them
in
story
and
to
stand
and
gaze
at
the
vast
sea
of
time
that
separates
us
from
them
it
was
early
days
then
the
world
was
not
enough
for
us
we
have
no
inclination
to
have
been
up
and
stirring
we
do
not
consider
the
six
thousand
years
of
the
world
before
we
were
born
as
so
much
time
lost
to
us
we
are
perfectly
indifferent
about
the
matter
we
do
not
grieve
and
lament
that
we
did
not
happen
to
be
in
time
to
see
the
grand
mask
and
pageant
of
human
life
going
on
in
all
that
period
though
we
are
mortified
at
being
obliged
to
quit
our
stand
before
the
rest
of
the
procession
passes
it
may
be
suggested
in
explanation
of
this
difference
that
we
know
from
various
records
and
traditions
what
happened
in
the
time
of
queen
anne
or
even
in
the
reigns
of
the
assyrian
monarchs
but
that
we
have
no
means
of
ascertaining
what
is
to
happen
hereafter
but
by
awaiting
the
event
and
that
our
eagerness
and
curiosity
are
sharpened
in
proportion
as
we
are
in
the
dark
about
it
this
is
not
at
all
the
case
for
at
that
rate
we
should
be
constantly
wishing
to
make
a
voyage
of
discovery
to
greenland
or
to
the
moon
neither
of
which
we
have
in
general
the
least
desire
to
do
neither
in
truth
have
we
any
particular
solicitude
to
pry
into
the
secrets
of
futurity
but
as
a
pretext
for
prolonging
our
own
existence
it
is
not
so
much
that
we
care
to
be
alive
a
hundred
or
a
thousand
years
hence
any
more
than
to
have
been
alive
a
hundred
or
a
thousand
years
ago
but
the
thing
lies
here
that
we
would
all
of
us
wish
the
present
moment
to
last
for
ever
we
would
be
as
we
are
and
would
have
the
world
remain
just
as
it
is
to
please
us
the
present
eye
catches
the
present
object
to
have
and
to
hold
while
it
may
and
abhors
on
any
terms
to
have
it
torn
from
us
and
nothing
left
in
its
room
it
is
the
pang
of
parting
the
unloosing
our
grasp
the
breaking
asunder
some
strong
tie
the
leaving
some
cherished
purpose
unfulfilled
that
creates
the
repugnance
to
go
and
calamity
of
so
long
life
as
it
often
is
o
thou
strong
heart
there
such
a
covenant
the
world
and
thee
they
loth
to
break
the
love
of
life
then
is
an
habitual
attachment
not
an
abstract
principle
simply
does
not
man
natural
desire
we
long
to
be
in
a
certain
time
place
and
circumstance
we
would
much
rather
be
now
this
bank
and
shoal
of
time
than
have
our
choice
of
any
future
period
than
take
a
slice
of
fifty
or
sixty
years
out
of
the
millennium
for
instance
this
shows
that
our
attachment
is
not
confined
either
to
or
to
but
that
we
have
an
inveterate
prejudice
in
favour
of
our
immediate
existence
such
as
it
is
the
mountaineer
will
not
leave
his
rock
nor
the
savage
his
hut
neither
are
we
willing
to
give
up
our
present
mode
of
life
with
all
its
advantages
and
disadvantages
for
any
other
that
could
be
substituted
for
it
no
man
would
i
think
exchange
his
existence
with
any
other
man
however
fortunate
we
had
as
lief
as
be
there
are
some
persons
of
that
reach
of
soul
that
they
would
like
to
live
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
hence
to
see
to
what
height
of
empire
america
will
have
grown
up
in
that
period
or
whether
the
english
constitution
will
last
so
long
these
are
points
beyond
me
but
i
confess
i
should
like
to
live
to
see
the
downfall
of
the
bourbons
that
is
a
vital
question
with
me
and
i
shall
like
it
the
better
the
sooner
it
happens
no
young
man
ever
thinks
he
shall
die
he
may
believe
that
others
will
or
assent
to
the
doctrine
that
men
are
mortal
as
an
abstract
proposition
but
he
is
far
enough
from
bringing
it
home
to
himself
individually
youth
buoyant
activity
and
animal
spirits
hold
absolute
antipathy
with
old
age
as
well
as
with
death
nor
have
we
in
the
of
life
any
more
than
in
the
thoughtlessness
of
childhood
the
remotest
conception
how
this
sensible
warm
motion
can
become
a
kneaded
clod
nor
how
sanguine
florid
health
and
vigour
shall
to
withered
weak
and
grey
or
if
in
a
moment
of
idle
speculation
we
indulge
in
this
notion
of
the
close
of
life
as
a
theory
it
is
amazing
at
what
a
distance
it
seems
what
a
long
leisurely
interval
there
is
between
what
a
contrast
its
slow
and
solemn
approach
affords
to
our
present
gay
dreams
of
existence
we
eye
the
farthest
verge
of
the
horizon
and
think
what
a
way
we
shall
have
to
look
back
upon
ere
we
arrive
at
our
journey
end
and
without
our
in
the
least
suspecting
it
the
mists
are
at
our
feet
and
the
shadows
of
age
encompass
us
the
two
divisions
of
our
lives
have
melted
into
each
other
the
extreme
points
close
and
meet
with
none
of
that
romantic
interval
stretching
out
between
them
that
we
had
reckoned
upon
and
for
the
rich
melancholy
solemn
hues
of
age
sear
the
yellow
leaf
the
deepening
shadows
of
an
autumnal
evening
we
only
feel
a
dank
cold
mist
encircling
all
objects
after
the
spirit
of
youth
is
fled
there
is
no
inducement
to
look
forward
and
what
is
worse
little
interest
in
looking
back
to
what
has
become
so
trite
and
common
the
pleasures
of
our
existence
have
worn
themselves
out
are
into
the
wastes
of
time
or
have
turned
their
indifferent
side
to
us
the
pains
by
their
repeated
blows
have
worn
us
out
and
have
left
us
neither
spirit
nor
inclination
to
encounter
them
again
in
retrospect
we
do
not
want
to
rip
up
old
grievances
nor
to
renew
our
youth
like
the
phoenix
nor
to
live
our
lives
twice
over
once
is
enough
as
the
tree
falls
so
let
it
lie
shut
up
the
book
and
close
the
account
once
for
all
it
has
been
thought
by
some
that
life
is
like
the
exploring
of
a
passage
that
grows
narrower
and
darker
the
farther
we
advance
without
a
possibility
of
ever
turning
back
and
where
we
are
stifled
for
want
of
breath
at
last
for
myself
i
do
not
complain
of
the
greater
thickness
of
the
atmosphere
as
i
approach
the
narrow
house
i
felt
it
more
formerly
when
the
idea
alone
seemed
to
suppress
a
thousand
rising
hopes
and
weighed
upon
the
pulses
of
the
blood
at
present
i
rather
feel
a
thinness
and
want
of
support
i
stretch
out
my
hand
to
some
object
and
find
none
i
am
too
much
in
a
world
of
abstraction
the
naked
map
of
life
is
spread
out
before
me
and
in
the
emptiness
and
desolation
i
see
death
coming
to
meet
me
in
my
youth
i
could
not
behold
him
for
the
crowd
of
objects
and
feelings
and
hope
stood
always
between
us
saying
mind
that
old
fellow
if
i
had
lived
indeed
i
should
not
care
to
die
but
i
do
not
like
a
contract
of
pleasure
broken
off
unfulfilled
a
marriage
with
joy
unconsummated
a
promise
of
happiness
rescinded
my
public
and
private
hopes
have
been
left
a
ruin
or
remain
only
to
mock
me
i
would
wish
them
to
be
i
should
like
to
see
some
prospect
of
good
to
mankind
such
as
my
life
began
with
i
should
like
to
leave
some
sterling
work
behind
me
i
should
like
to
have
some
friendly
hand
to
consign
me
to
the
grave
on
these
conditions
i
am
ready
if
not
willing
to
depart
i
shall
then
write
on
my
tomb
grateful
and
contented
but
i
have
thought
and
suffered
too
much
to
be
willing
to
have
thought
and
suffered
in
in
looking
back
it
sometimes
appears
to
me
as
if
i
had
in
a
manner
slept
out
my
life
in
a
dream
or
shadow
on
the
side
of
the
hill
of
knowledge
where
i
have
fed
on
books
on
thoughts
on
pictures
and
only
heard
in
the
trampling
of
busy
feet
or
the
noises
of
the
throng
below
waked
out
of
this
dim
twilight
existence
and
startled
with
the
passing
scene
i
have
felt
a
wish
to
descend
to
the
world
of
realities
and
join
in
the
chase
but
i
fear
too
late
and
that
i
had
better
return
to
my
bookish
chimeras
and
indolence
once
more
lascia
le
donne
et
studia
la
i
will
think
of
it
it
is
not
wonderful
that
the
contemplation
and
fear
of
death
become
more
familiar
to
us
as
we
approach
nearer
to
it
that
life
seems
to
ebb
with
the
decay
of
blood
and
youthful
spirits
and
that
as
we
find
everything
about
us
subject
to
chance
and
change
as
our
strength
and
beauty
die
as
our
hopes
and
passions
our
friends
and
our
affections
leave
us
we
begin
by
degrees
to
feel
ourselves
mortal
i
have
never
seen
death
but
once
and
that
was
in
an
infant
it
is
years
ago
the
look
was
calm
and
placid
and
the
face
was
fair
and
firm
it
was
as
if
a
waxen
image
had
been
laid
out
in
the
coffin
and
strewed
with
innocent
flowers
it
was
not
like
death
but
more
like
an
image
of
life
no
breath
moved
the
lips
no
pulse
stirred
no
sight
or
sound
would
enter
those
eyes
or
ears
more
while
i
looked
at
it
i
saw
no
pain
was
there
it
seemed
to
smile
at
the
short
pang
of
life
which
was
over
but
i
could
not
bear
the
to
be
closed
it
seemed
to
stifle
me
and
still
as
the
nettles
wave
in
a
corner
of
the
churchyard
over
his
little
grave
the
welcome
breeze
helps
to
refresh
me
and
ease
the
tightness
at
my
breast
an
ivory
or
marble
image
like
chantry
monument
of
the
two
children
is
contemplated
with
pure
delight
why
do
we
not
grieve
and
fret
that
the
marble
is
not
alive
or
fancy
that
it
has
a
shortness
of
breath
it
never
was
alive
and
it
is
the
difficulty
of
making
the
transition
from
life
to
death
the
struggle
between
the
two
in
our
imagination
that
confounds
their
properties
painfully
together
and
makes
us
conceive
that
the
infant
that
is
but
just
dead
still
wants
to
breathe
to
enjoy
and
look
about
it
and
is
prevented
by
the
icy
hand
of
death
locking
up
its
faculties
and
benumbing
its
senses
so
that
if
it
could
it
would
complain
of
its
own
hard
state
perhaps
religious
considerations
reconcile
the
mind
to
this
change
sooner
than
any
others
by
representing
the
spirit
as
fled
to
another
sphere
and
leaving
the
body
behind
it
so
in
reflecting
on
death
generally
we
mix
up
the
idea
of
life
with
it
and
thus
make
it
the
ghastly
monster
it
is
we
think
how
we
should
feel
not
how
the
dead
feel
still
from
the
tomb
the
voice
of
nature
cries
even
in
our
ashes
live
their
wonted
fires
there
is
an
admirable
passage
on
this
subject
in
tucker
of
nature
which
i
shall
transcribe
as
by
much
the
best
illustration
i
can
offer
of
it
melancholy
appearance
of
a
lifeless
body
the
mansion
provided
for
it
to
inhabit
dark
cold
close
and
solitary
are
shocking
to
the
imagination
but
it
is
to
the
imagination
only
not
the
understanding
for
whoever
consults
this
faculty
will
see
at
first
glance
that
there
is
nothing
dismal
in
all
these
circumstances
if
the
corpse
were
kept
wrapped
up
in
a
warm
bed
with
a
roasting
fire
in
the
chamber
it
would
feel
no
comfortable
warmth
therefrom
were
store
of
tapers
lighted
up
as
soon
as
day
shuts
in
it
would
see
no
objects
to
divert
it
were
it
left
at
large
it
would
have
no
liberty
nor
if
surrounded
with
company
would
be
cheered
thereby
neither
are
the
distorted
features
expressions
of
pain
uneasiness
or
distress
this
every
one
knows
and
will
readily
allow
upon
being
suggested
yet
still
can
not
behold
nor
even
cast
a
thought
upon
those
objects
without
shuddering
for
knowing
that
a
living
person
must
suffer
grievously
under
such
appearances
they
become
habitually
formidable
to
the
mind
and
strike
a
mechanical
horror
which
is
increased
by
the
customs
of
the
world
around
us
there
is
usually
one
pang
added
voluntarily
and
unnecessarily
to
the
fear
of
death
by
our
affecting
to
compassionate
the
loss
which
others
will
have
in
us
if
that
were
all
we
might
reasonably
set
our
minds
at
rest
the
pathetic
exhortation
on
country
tombstones
not
for
me
my
wife
and
children
dear
is
for
the
most
part
speedily
followed
to
the
letter
we
do
not
leave
so
great
a
void
in
society
as
we
are
inclined
to
imagine
partly
to
magnify
our
own
importance
and
partly
to
console
ourselves
by
sympathy
even
in
the
same
family
the
gap
is
not
so
great
the
wound
closes
up
sooner
than
we
should
expect
nay
is
not
unfrequently
thought
better
than
people
walk
along
the
streets
the
day
after
our
deaths
just
as
they
did
before
and
the
crowd
is
not
diminished
while
we
were
living
the
world
seemed
in
a
manner
to
exist
only
for
us
for
our
delight
and
amusement
because
it
contributed
to
them
but
our
hearts
cease
to
beat
and
it
goes
on
as
usual
and
thinks
no
more
about
us
than
it
did
in
our
lifetime
the
million
are
devoid
of
sentiment
and
care
as
little
for
you
or
me
as
if
we
belonged
to
the
moon
we
live
the
week
over
in
the
sunday
paper
or
are
decently
interred
in
some
obituary
at
the
month
end
it
is
not
surprising
that
we
are
forgotten
so
soon
after
we
quit
this
mortal
stage
we
are
scarcely
noticed
while
we
are
on
it
it
is
not
merely
that
our
names
are
not
known
in
china
they
have
hardly
been
heard
of
in
the
next
street
we
are
hand
and
glove
with
the
universe
and
think
the
obligation
is
mutual
this
is
an
evident
fallacy
if
this
however
does
not
trouble
us
now
it
will
not
hereafter
a
handful
of
dust
can
have
no
quarrel
to
pick
with
its
neighbours
or
complaint
to
make
against
providence
and
might
well
exclaim
if
it
had
but
an
understanding
and
a
tongue
thy
ways
old
world
swing
round
in
blue
ether
voluble
to
every
age
you
and
i
shall
no
more
jostle
it
is
amazing
how
soon
the
rich
and
titled
and
even
some
of
those
who
have
wielded
great
political
power
are
forgotten
a
little
rule
a
little
sway
is
all
the
great
and
mighty
have
betwixt
the
cradle
and
the
grave
and
after
its
short
date
they
hardly
leave
a
name
behind
them
great
man
memory
may
at
the
common
rate
survive
him
half
a
year
his
heirs
and
successors
take
his
titles
his
power
and
his
wealth
all
that
made
him
considerable
or
courted
by
others
and
he
has
left
nothing
else
behind
him
either
to
delight
or
benefit
the
world
posterity
are
not
by
any
means
so
disinterested
as
they
are
supposed
to
be
they
give
their
gratitude
and
admiration
only
in
return
for
benefits
conferred
they
cherish
the
memory
of
those
to
whom
they
are
indebted
for
instruction
and
delight
and
they
cherish
it
just
in
proportion
to
the
instruction
and
delight
they
are
conscious
they
receive
the
sentiment
of
admiration
springs
immediately
from
this
ground
and
can
not
be
otherwise
than
well
founded
the
effeminate
clinging
to
life
as
such
as
a
general
or
abstract
idea
is
the
effect
of
a
highly
civilised
and
artificial
state
of
society
men
formerly
plunged
into
all
the
vicissitudes
and
dangers
of
war
or
staked
their
all
upon
a
single
die
or
some
one
passion
which
if
they
could
not
have
gratified
life
became
a
burden
to
them
now
our
strongest
passion
is
to
think
our
chief
amusement
is
to
read
new
plays
new
poems
new
novels
and
this
we
may
do
at
our
leisure
in
perfect
security
if
we
look
into
the
old
histories
and
romances
before
the
neutralised
human
affairs
and
reduced
passion
to
a
state
of
mental
equivocation
we
find
the
heroes
and
heroines
not
setting
their
lives
a
pin
fee
but
rather
courting
opportunities
of
throwing
them
away
in
very
wantonness
of
spirit
they
raise
their
fondness
for
some
favourite
pursuit
to
its
height
to
a
pitch
of
madness
and
think
no
price
too
dear
to
pay
for
its
full
gratification
everything
else
is
dross
they
go
to
death
as
to
a
bridal
bed
and
sacrifice
themselves
or
others
without
remorse
at
the
shrine
of
love
of
honour
of
religion
or
any
other
prevailing
feeling
romeo
runs
his
weary
bark
upon
the
rocks
of
death
the
instant
he
finds
himself
deprived
of
his
juliet
and
she
clasps
his
neck
in
their
last
agonies
and
follows
him
to
the
same
fatal
shore
one
strong
idea
takes
possession
of
the
mind
and
overrules
every
other
and
even
life
itself
joyless
without
that
becomes
an
object
of
indifference
or
loathing
there
is
at
least
more
of
imagination
in
such
a
state
of
things
more
vigour
of
feeling
and
promptitude
to
act
than
in
our
lingering
languid
protracted
attachment
to
life
for
its
own
poor
sake
it
is
perhaps
also
better
as
well
as
more
heroical
to
strike
at
some
daring
or
darling
object
and
if
we
fail
in
that
to
take
the
consequences
manfully
than
to
renew
the
lease
of
a
tedious
spiritless
charmless
existence
merely
as
pierre
says
lose
it
afterwards
in
some
vile
brawl
for
some
worthless
object
was
there
not
a
spirit
of
martyrdom
as
well
as
a
spice
of
the
reckless
energy
of
barbarism
in
this
bold
defiance
of
death
had
not
religion
something
to
do
with
it
the
implicit
belief
in
a
future
life
which
rendered
this
of
less
value
and
embodied
something
beyond
it
to
the
imagination
so
that
the
rough
soldier
the
infatuated
lover
the
valorous
knight
could
afford
to
throw
away
the
present
venture
and
take
a
leap
into
the
arms
of
futurity
which
the
modern
sceptic
shrinks
back
from
with
all
his
boasted
reason
and
vain
philosophy
weaker
than
a
woman
i
can
not
help
thinking
so
myself
but
i
have
endeavoured
to
explain
this
point
before
and
will
not
enlarge
farther
on
it
here
a
life
of
action
and
danger
moderates
the
dread
of
death
it
not
only
gives
us
fortitude
to
bear
pain
but
teaches
us
at
every
step
the
precarious
tenure
on
which
we
hold
our
present
being
sedentary
and
studious
men
are
the
most
apprehensive
on
this
score
johnson
was
an
instance
in
point
a
few
years
seemed
to
him
soon
over
compared
with
those
sweeping
contemplations
on
time
and
infinity
with
which
he
had
been
used
to
pose
himself
in
the
of
a
man
of
letters
there
was
no
obvious
reason
for
a
change
he
might
sit
in
an
and
pour
out
cups
of
tea
to
all
eternity
would
it
had
been
possible
for
him
to
do
so
the
most
rational
cure
after
all
for
the
inordinate
fear
of
death
is
to
set
a
just
value
on
life
if
we
merely
wish
to
continue
on
the
scene
to
indulge
our
headstrong
humours
and
tormenting
passions
we
had
better
begone
at
once
and
if
we
only
cherish
a
fondness
for
existence
according
to
the
good
we
derive
from
it
the
pang
we
feel
at
parting
with
it
will
not
be
very
severe
notes
to
essay
xvii
all
men
think
all
men
mortal
but
themselves
young
i
remember
once
in
particular
having
this
feeling
in
reading
schiller
where
there
is
a
description
of
death
in
a
degree
that
almost
stifled
me
it
has
been
usual
to
raise
a
very
unjust
clamour
against
the
enormous
salaries
of
public
singers
actors
and
so
on
this
matter
seems
reducible
to
a
moral
equation
they
are
paid
out
of
money
raised
by
voluntary
contributions
in
the
strictest
sense
and
if
they
did
not
bring
certain
sums
into
the
treasury
the
managers
would
not
engage
them
these
sums
are
exactly
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
individuals
to
whom
their
performance
gives
an
extraordinary
degree
of
pleasure
the
talents
of
a
singer
actor
are
therefore
worth
just
as
much
as
they
will
fetch
