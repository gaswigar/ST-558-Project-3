the
drawings
of
rossetti
by
martin
wood
the
intensely
subjective
nature
of
rossetti
art
is
what
gives
it
fascination
for
its
lovers
it
belonged
to
himself
even
in
his
early
period
and
with
his
dramatic
subjects
this
was
so
and
partly
by
the
depth
of
imaginative
meaning
he
read
into
the
faces
of
women
the
last
phase
of
his
art
was
entirely
one
of
his
own
moments
of
sorrow
were
mirrored
in
one
woman
face
moments
in
which
he
created
sadly
living
over
again
in
them
some
hours
that
had
been
happy
this
is
her
picture
as
she
was
it
seems
a
thing
to
wonder
on
as
though
mine
image
in
the
glass
should
tarry
when
myself
am
gone
for
so
was
the
still
movement
of
her
hands
and
such
the
pure
line
gracious
flow
is
she
though
of
herself
alas
less
than
her
shadow
on
the
grass
or
than
her
image
in
the
stream
one
might
hazard
the
question
whether
it
were
possible
for
a
painter
such
as
rossetti
seeking
expression
in
his
art
for
this
intensity
of
feeling
to
vie
in
the
rendering
of
the
external
aspects
with
those
painters
who
have
approached
life
with
that
cold
acuteness
to
the
appearance
of
things
and
aloofness
from
their
meaning
characteristic
of
work
that
has
contributed
largely
to
the
actual
science
of
painting
to
rossetti
life
came
there
was
too
much
for
him
to
realise
in
his
working
moments
the
very
richness
of
his
nature
embarrassed
his
output
his
gifts
gave
him
so
many
ways
of
from
which
to
choose
the
phases
through
which
his
genius
passed
the
result
of
an
inherited
and
rare
temperament
and
its
adventures
made
the
science
of
painting
prosaic
for
him
he
himself
felt
latterly
that
this
impatience
had
left
his
ideas
pathetically
at
the
mercy
of
his
materials
apart
from
the
quality
in
colour
to
which
he
attained
one
is
conscious
always
in
his
paintings
of
the
tragedy
of
genius
striving
for
expression
through
an
ineffectual
technique
rossetti
individuality
however
was
so
strong
that
it
stamped
itself
everywhere
in
spite
of
every
limitation
his
art
explains
his
attitude
towards
life
in
his
ability
to
make
it
show
this
his
greatness
lies
and
in
the
fact
that
the
point
of
view
that
it
suggested
was
his
alone
his
art
created
for
itself
its
own
atmosphere
an
unfamiliar
one
at
first
to
englishmen
with
its
subserviency
of
everything
to
a
romantic
emotionalism
the
histories
of
the
world
for
rossetti
were
its
stories
of
emotion
and
in
every
place
that
his
memory
knew
love
image
had
been
set
to
reign
love
who
had
wandered
down
through
the
ages
decked
with
the
flowers
of
art
offerings
of
bygone
lovers
dead
lovers
to
never
dying
love
as
a
strange
spirit
rossetti
entered
modern
london
a
heart
rich
from
many
forgotten
experiences
seemed
to
have
lodged
itself
in
him
and
he
painted
with
eyes
filled
with
the
colours
of
old
things
for
him
the
tapestries
could
never
fade
in
a
room
that
had
known
history
nor
the
colours
leave
the
missal
which
told
the
story
of
a
soul
how
far
his
drawings
were
intended
to
foreshadow
large
paintings
which
he
desired
to
make
as
windows
for
us
to
look
with
him
into
his
romantic
country
we
can
not
say
as
it
is
they
show
that
it
was
in
power
to
be
the
greatest
imaginative
illustrator
of
his
century
that
he
was
not
so
seems
to
prove
that
in
this
way
as
in
some
others
he
failed
to
attain
to
much
that
at
first
had
seemed
included
in
his
destiny
in
his
paintings
in
his
poetry
in
these
drawings
something
there
is
that
was
new
and
that
brought
a
fresh
phase
into
art
and
literature
in
england
it
is
something
which
has
influenced
permanently
the
nation
thought
and
has
been
even
admitted
into
the
procession
of
its
fashions
for
a
time
women
tried
to
look
as
the
women
in
his
paintings
so
much
had
the
type
he
chose
which
was
his
own
creation
imposed
itself
upon
their
imagination
the
rossetti
woman
if
she
did
not
supersede
the
early
victorian
type
at
least
helped
to
change
it
and
to
mark
a
change
which
was
taking
place
in
the
ideals
of
the
nation
fresh
tendencies
in
national
thought
are
always
correspondingly
represented
by
a
change
in
the
type
of
women
idealised
in
its
art
and
poetry
when
the
victorian
type
went
the
time
had
passed
when
homage
was
given
to
women
for
a
surrender
of
their
claims
on
life
the
new
type
spoke
of
the
ardent
way
in
which
another
generation
of
women
was
creating
for
itself
wide
interests
in
the
world
rossetti
displayed
in
his
art
the
dramatic
sense
we
find
him
in
his
earlier
drawings
always
illustrating
dramatic
subjects
rendering
action
in
his
figures
in
a
way
that
proclaims
him
at
once
as
one
of
those
to
whom
the
actions
of
men
the
faces
of
women
come
tragically
or
otherwise
into
every
dream
one
is
enabled
to
write
more
clearly
on
this
point
by
comparing
him
with
his
friend
figures
live
in
a
dream
in
which
the
world
has
little
part
whilst
rossetti
dream
is
of
the
world
itself
his
work
is
rich
with
the
human
experience
that
is
absent
in
the
art
of
his
friend
he
is
accredited
with
being
the
leader
of
a
phase
of
decadence
while
as
a
matter
of
fact
no
one
could
have
been
further
removed
from
anything
like
a
decadent
pose
rossetti
had
an
unconscious
and
unexplained
sympathy
for
life
that
tragically
pursued
and
found
itself
shipwrecked
upon
its
own
illusions
it
was
part
of
his
vitality
there
was
little
defiance
in
his
attitude
it
was
altogether
one
of
pity
indiscriminate
publication
has
familiarised
the
public
only
with
the
last
sad
phase
of
rossetti
art
and
unhappily
this
is
esteemed
characteristic
the
intimate
patrons
of
the
painter
possessed
themselves
of
his
early
work
now
it
is
inaccessible
and
it
is
not
at
his
best
that
he
is
seen
in
any
public
collection
it
is
possible
to
like
the
art
of
rossetti
very
deeply
and
also
to
love
the
changing
colours
of
the
sea
and
the
shadows
of
the
sun
clouds
moving
swiftly
on
the
hills
but
often
to
pagan
lovers
of
such
things
the
art
of
rossetti
shuttered
close
in
its
mediaeval
darkened
rooms
has
seemed
as
an
almost
poisonous
flower
with
its
forgetfulness
of
the
world
without
it
can
never
be
sufficiently
emphasised
how
necessary
it
is
in
judging
any
art
first
of
all
to
share
some
of
the
mood
in
which
it
was
created
those
who
would
enter
into
the
atmosphere
of
rossetti
art
must
find
their
way
to
it
in
the
darkened
light
of
dreams
it
stands
in
no
relation
whatever
to
the
workaday
world
a
poet
whose
writings
realised
an
opposite
temperament
to
own
would
have
had
the
test
of
poetry
that
it
could
be
taken
to
the
fields
in
the
early
morning
and
read
to
attempt
to
bring
a
painting
of
rossetti
into
relationship
with
nature
out
of
doors
would
to
all
intents
put
an
end
to
the
reason
for
its
artistic
existence
it
would
be
to
demand
of
it
that
it
should
strike
a
note
in
tune
with
a
mood
the
direct
opposite
to
that
which
it
was
its
intention
to
create
though
art
should
always
be
examined
in
its
own
atmosphere
much
of
the
criticism
applied
to
rossetti
is
but
the
bringing
of
his
art
out
into
the
fields
it
is
not
valuable
criticism
that
approaches
work
in
a
spirit
of
this
kind
a
great
deal
too
much
has
been
made
in
writing
of
to
a
nature
like
rossetti
any
school
any
methods
he
may
have
taken
up
with
or
inspired
would
be
largely
accidental
to
his
environment
arrived
at
a
time
of
reaction
of
revolution
in
english
painting
with
his
qualities
of
leadership
he
threw
himself
into
as
a
new
movement
but
it
is
more
than
probable
his
genius
would
have
found
methods
of
expression
as
personal
to
itself
in
the
refinements
that
entered
english
painting
in
the
wake
of
only
the
movement
could
not
have
been
but
for
the
ardent
genius
of
rossetti
which
poured
inspiration
into
all
those
who
gathered
about
him
he
departed
from
tenets
just
when
it
suited
him
its
hold
over
him
lay
chiefly
in
that
he
liked
to
realise
very
definitely
the
shapes
of
objects
in
his
art
because
they
made
his
dreams
real
and
gave
pleasure
to
those
eyes
of
his
that
so
hungered
after
every
sign
of
beauty
the
secrets
of
art
lie
after
all
more
within
the
vision
than
in
expression
that
rossetti
could
have
directed
his
genius
into
another
manner
from
seems
possible
from
the
fact
that
in
his
poetry
so
many
styles
meet
and
show
his
variegated
temperament
expressing
itself
in
opposing
forms
what
was
of
literary
significance
in
art
perhaps
gained
from
for
made
things
symbolical
to
nearly
every
object
that
they
brought
into
their
pictures
the
gave
meaning
other
than
its
own
other
than
that
which
was
simply
artistic
now
rossetti
looking
on
his
art
and
its
relationship
to
life
from
a
literary
more
than
from
an
artistic
standpoint
striving
to
attain
in
art
not
an
imitation
of
life
but
an
expression
of
his
ideas
about
it
found
as
we
have
said
problems
a
difficulty
he
was
irritated
by
difficulties
which
to
a
painter
present
pleasures
of
conquest
in
proportion
to
their
resistance
to
his
craftsmanship
and
skill
in
other
ways
rossetti
lacked
the
characteristics
of
really
great
painters
as
such
he
had
not
the
seeing
eye
that
gives
to
every
outward
thing
a
shape
and
colour
already
formed
within
the
mind
from
such
a
cult
of
the
eyes
as
this
comes
the
true
painter
by
taking
thought
art
does
not
become
a
metaphor
for
ideas
though
the
whole
aim
of
its
subject
may
be
to
make
it
so
art
is
always
metaphorical
whatever
its
subject
and
however
unconsciously
to
itself
the
presence
of
genius
only
is
needed
yet
because
in
actual
pigment
red
can
never
be
anything
other
than
red
ideas
are
clothed
more
easily
in
the
colour
of
words
for
in
themselves
words
have
no
colour
and
they
have
no
existence
other
than
the
existence
which
they
have
in
thought
and
the
colour
which
any
language
lends
them
rossetti
could
not
learn
painting
instinctively
as
he
learnt
writing
for
him
the
materials
were
not
so
simple
they
remained
during
a
long
apprenticeship
an
obstacle
rather
than
an
aid
to
impassioned
expression
and
from
his
apprenticeship
he
never
emerged
into
anything
approaching
freedom
upon
the
vivacity
of
the
imagination
in
them
and
not
upon
subtlety
of
line
or
of
observation
the
claims
of
drawings
rest
though
it
is
wonderful
how
often
he
lifts
his
art
up
to
the
level
of
all
that
he
has
to
say
and
imposes
upon
us
a
forgetfulness
of
its
shortcomings
his
studies
do
not
reveal
a
master
who
looked
upon
objects
and
beautiful
forms
for
their
own
sake
and
for
the
sake
of
the
tender
drawing
he
could
find
in
them
rossetti
indeed
loved
a
visible
world
and
liked
to
interpret
the
beauty
of
natural
objects
but
he
was
always
in
haste
to
get
the
scene
set
where
such
objects
were
after
all
for
him
only
as
accessories
to
the
thing
enacted
or
as
notes
in
an
orchestration
of
value
but
not
existing
by
themselves
he
gave
to
every
object
the
import
of
the
drama
in
his
mind
in
his
art
things
seem
to
have
about
them
the
meaning
lent
them
by
an
imagination
that
spiritualised
objective
things
so
that
they
seem
there
in
essence
only
and
rendered
with
a
sympathy
that
shows
how
alive
to
the
significance
of
outward
beauty
rossetti
was
and
how
his
own
time
and
surroundings
were
fused
and
blent
with
his
most
imaginings
to
turn
to
outward
things
and
to
study
them
as
merely
offering
various
surfaces
to
the
light
holding
depths
of
shadow
possessing
lines
of
delicate
shape
was
however
impossible
to
his
temperament
the
characteristic
story
of
madox
brown
setting
in
early
days
the
young
rossetti
down
to
paint
such
still
life
as
jam
jars
and
of
the
young
painter
impatience
shows
that
to
paint
or
draw
the
objects
for
their
own
sake
only
was
not
congenial
to
him
there
was
very
likely
sufficient
of
the
true
painter
in
rossetti
to
make
such
study
a
delight
had
his
mind
ever
been
still
enough
for
his
hand
to
playfully
carry
out
such
problems
but
always
at
the
back
of
his
mind
at
the
back
of
the
world
for
him
a
strange
drama
of
love
and
beauty
went
on
how
then
could
time
be
spent
in
studying
what
after
all
were
merely
objects
how
could
time
be
spent
in
deliberating
over
the
study
of
them
and
so
the
drawings
which
rossetti
left
us
are
seldom
studies
of
poses
and
draperies
such
elaborate
scaffolding
as
that
upon
which
the
art
of
was
built
they
are
little
pictures
in
most
cases
in
which
the
pencil
or
the
pen
afforded
a
readier
and
less
laboured
means
of
realising
quickly
the
life
dramatic
of
imagination
illustration
essentially
suited
his
genius
in
so
far
as
in
small
dimensions
it
was
easier
to
reflect
easily
whilst
the
power
of
creation
lasted
what
was
moving
in
a
mind
that
was
held
by
no
one
mood
for
long
it
suited
his
genius
also
because
it
minimised
the
labour
of
creation
and
with
rossetti
it
was
always
apparent
that
creation
was
a
labour
he
himself
has
said
in
that
other
art
in
which
perhaps
he
always
found
his
happiest
expression
unto
the
man
of
yearning
thought
and
aspiration
to
do
nought
is
in
itself
almost
an
act
being
and
cataract
of
the
soul
utter
depths
unseal
a
body
that
grew
faint
under
the
strain
of
genius
undoubtedly
imposed
its
indolence
upon
rossetti
spirit
so
that
he
shirked
the
difficulties
of
his
earlier
subjects
until
the
downfall
of
his
art
set
in
with
the
constant
production
for
indiscriminating
purchasers
of
a
face
that
grew
more
and
more
distant
from
the
beautiful
type
of
his
earlier
inspiration
which
till
the
end
he
always
pathetically
imagined
himself
to
be
creating
turning
to
the
illustrations
that
called
drawing
for
a
with
its
free
and
loose
handling
its
qualities
of
selection
and
emphasis
show
how
great
in
many
ways
rossetti
was
what
lines
could
be
simpler
than
those
in
the
girl
dress
in
such
a
sketch
as
this
in
the
little
things
rossetti
is
masterly
and
one
can
not
here
separate
what
he
has
to
say
from
the
saying
of
it
this
sketch
shows
an
artist
great
enough
to
be
unpretentious
and
it
shows
that
the
happy
qualities
of
mind
united
with
its
craft
sprang
from
his
habits
of
thought
we
see
in
it
with
what
natural
tenderness
he
has
sketched
how
by
one
of
the
hands
her
companion
face
is
lifted
to
the
kiss
this
naturalness
holds
the
secret
of
rossetti
power
his
art
was
consciously
set
on
decoration
but
this
is
not
a
decoration
in
all
that
he
has
read
into
the
miniature
faces
and
in
the
embracing
of
the
hands
we
get
in
this
sketch
more
intimately
than
anywhere
else
evidence
of
his
great
heart
this
dramatic
sympathy
would
attract
every
one
could
it
shine
more
often
through
the
carelessness
the
unhappiness
that
at
the
end
obscured
it
in
this
way
we
must
think
of
rossetti
as
a
failure
and
a
great
man
can
not
fail
once
without
blinding
the
world
to
his
many
successes
had
rossetti
possessed
no
sense
of
colour
and
had
he
not
completed
many
large
pictures
and
elaborate
illustrations
but
only
followed
this
one
path
as
far
as
he
could
go
doing
only
such
things
as
this
without
being
a
poet
and
without
being
a
painter
who
knows
to
what
extent
we
should
have
praised
him
for
these
slighter
things
alone
there
is
no
doubt
that
we
expect
so
much
from
him
and
he
has
given
us
so
much
in
other
ways
that
we
forget
the
treasures
hidden
here
one
could
wish
that
he
had
always
worked
in
his
drawings
with
the
freedom
indicated
in
this
sketch
but
it
was
not
the
fashion
then
work
in
rossetti
day
had
to
come
into
the
market
elaborated
to
the
point
of
its
soul
extinction
in
order
to
be
taken
seriously
now
that
we
have
taught
ourselves
always
to
value
first
any
indication
of
the
spirit
what
would
we
not
give
to
possess
ourselves
of
work
by
this
artist
in
impulsive
drawings
and
it
must
have
been
within
rossetti
power
to
do
them
down
to
the
last
the
drawing
of
the
death
of
lady
macbeth
is
one
of
the
most
wonderful
things
rossetti
ever
did
and
it
is
characteristically
marred
by
imperfect
drawing
the
drawing
is
of
great
quality
throughout
except
for
the
figure
with
head
averted
some
wonder
why
the
ability
to
make
the
rest
of
the
picture
perfect
failed
the
artist
here
it
is
probably
because
the
action
of
each
figure
is
controlled
only
by
the
imaginative
impulse
that
sways
the
whole
composition
that
gives
to
every
part
of
it
dramatic
intensity
as
if
executed
all
in
one
mood
bringing
in
one
moment
of
creation
the
whole
to
life
on
paper
those
in
sympathy
with
the
nature
of
rossetti
art
do
not
count
this
piece
of
bad
drawing
a
disastrous
flaw
the
rarity
of
genius
makes
them
accept
everything
gratefully
it
disarms
a
cavilling
attitude
the
fault
in
their
eyes
even
seems
to
add
to
the
tense
note
struck
as
a
changed
note
in
an
over
sweet
harmony
its
dissonance
breaks
the
monotonous
rhythmic
decoration
and
its
harshness
relieves
the
detail
so
delicately
wrought
rossetti
is
of
the
extreme
few
who
have
finished
minutely
without
sacrificing
the
qualities
of
greater
significance
than
finish
his
art
is
great
enough
to
make
us
forget
the
detail
and
to
render
us
for
the
time
oblivious
of
it
in
our
absorption
in
the
subject
it
seems
for
a
time
not
to
exist
only
the
tense
mood
exists
the
intense
moment
in
a
picture
in
which
the
moments
are
aflame
with
tragedy
rossetti
drew
this
figure
moving
slowly
and
with
decorative
convention
all
the
figures
are
controlled
by
such
a
convention
they
are
partaking
in
a
high
drama
such
a
convention
as
irving
has
in
the
art
of
acting
gives
something
to
the
dignity
of
tragedy
the
conventions
of
rossetti
too
are
so
much
in
the
spirit
of
high
art
they
conform
so
well
to
the
claims
of
art
that
they
lend
beauty
to
that
power
of
his
of
giving
to
his
drawings
dramatic
perfection
in
regard
to
the
particular
figure
of
which
we
write
it
is
better
faulty
as
it
is
than
if
it
had
been
redrawn
in
another
mood
and
given
again
to
the
picture
it
is
to
be
regretted
of
course
that
it
did
not
come
rightly
as
it
is
but
it
is
less
to
be
regretted
than
if
he
had
substituted
dead
perfection
for
living
imperfection
a
studied
and
acquired
idea
of
the
pose
in
place
of
the
instinctive
one
the
first
illustration
for
desdemona
death
song
is
simply
a
rough
sketch
but
even
taken
as
such
it
shows
how
blind
or
how
careless
in
the
matter
of
form
rossetti
at
times
could
be
here
the
lower
part
of
the
figure
is
so
obviously
lacking
in
proportion
that
it
prevents
us
accepting
an
otherwise
characteristic
drawing
as
such
still
of
rossetti
best
moments
is
the
controlling
grace
of
the
bend
in
the
maid
wrist
and
the
movement
of
her
head
as
she
combs
hair
the
curtain
blown
into
the
room
by
the
wind
is
one
of
those
touches
rossetti
gives
everywhere
by
insistence
on
such
an
incident
he
makes
us
live
the
moments
depicted
in
his
pictures
just
as
we
find
ourselves
in
moments
of
extreme
tension
watching
eagerly
something
absolutely
trivial
and
making
some
accident
portent
with
meaning
in
the
second
and
completer
study
for
this
picture
we
find
the
proportions
corrected
thought
and
have
developed
the
artist
intentions
desdemona
with
her
hand
hanging
thoughtfully
is
an
improvement
on
her
attitude
at
first
the
maid
however
has
lost
much
of
the
spontaneity
of
her
original
gestures
like
all
those
in
whose
art
we
find
phases
of
an
extraordinary
beauty
rossetti
could
often
draw
in
the
most
uninspired
fashion
presumably
where
his
interest
flagged
in
the
drawing
of
hamlet
and
ophelia
ophelia
is
charming
but
it
is
with
difficulty
that
we
are
reconciled
to
the
hamlet
it
is
difficult
even
to
understand
in
what
position
the
figure
is
standing
not
that
this
indefiniteness
often
matters
in
art
but
here
where
everything
else
is
so
precise
it
provokes
dissatisfaction
from
rossetti
alone
could
have
come
the
background
with
the
winding
ways
parting
and
meeting
rhythmically
with
steps
up
to
the
bridge
such
architecture
as
this
and
all
the
quaint
furniture
in
his
pictures
were
designed
by
himself
from
his
facile
imagination
anything
might
come
certain
objects
that
were
full
of
associations
of
old
things
he
returned
to
often
in
his
drawings
such
as
old
books
of
hours
with
all
the
sentiment
that
many
hands
had
given
to
them
the
niche
in
the
picture
containing
the
crucifix
and
the
breviaries
is
significant
of
the
religion
in
rossetti
art
this
was
his
religion
to
think
of
divine
things
by
the
legends
of
a
romantic
church
in
comparing
the
study
for
at
the
house
of
simon
the
with
the
completed
drawing
the
question
arises
whether
with
the
elaboration
that
has
come
into
the
latter
some
of
the
intensity
of
the
study
has
escaped
or
whether
on
the
other
hand
the
subject
has
gained
the
simplicity
of
the
first
undoubtedly
possesses
something
which
is
subsequently
lost
in
elaboration
and
yet
taking
the
completed
picture
and
looking
into
it
one
finds
a
lesson
in
rossetti
methods
we
find
that
by
dwelling
upon
his
subject
he
has
emphasised
certain
notes
has
repeated
as
it
were
a
refrain
and
made
more
spirited
and
poetic
in
rendering
the
figure
of
the
lover
in
the
foreground
have
given
every
touch
that
could
possibly
enrich
and
at
the
same
time
concentrate
dramatic
motif
in
this
figure
the
embroidery
on
his
coat
the
flowers
in
his
hair
the
hair
itself
and
the
face
so
mocking
and
fascinating
and
sure
of
itself
is
more
in
the
spirit
of
the
subject
than
the
gentler
face
as
it
appears
in
the
sketch
the
figure
of
the
magdalene
gains
in
many
ways
as
completed
and
though
the
distressed
loving
face
and
the
flowing
hair
of
the
sketch
are
changed
the
alteration
of
the
expression
on
the
face
from
one
of
intense
distress
to
one
of
proud
determination
is
very
interesting
as
showing
how
his
subjects
grew
and
changed
under
his
hand
it
is
wholly
to
the
gain
of
the
picture
the
different
gesture
which
he
has
arrived
at
in
the
second
drawing
where
the
magdalene
with
both
hands
throws
the
flowers
from
her
hair
the
dramatic
quality
upon
which
we
have
insisted
as
part
of
rossetti
art
is
nowhere
better
shown
than
in
the
deer
quietly
eating
leaves
from
the
wall
all
unconscious
that
there
is
acted
out
beside
it
the
most
pathetically
beautiful
drama
of
the
world
one
misses
in
the
finished
picture
some
of
the
sensitive
drawing
given
in
the
sketch
to
the
magdalene
dress
here
instead
her
clothes
are
as
if
she
were
perfectly
still
they
give
no
indication
of
her
movements
and
the
stormy
action
round
her
that
is
the
fault
of
to
fritter
away
the
spirit
for
the
sake
of
the
embroidery
upon
the
body
clothes
to
lose
emphasis
in
elaboration
to
sacrifice
a
greater
beauty
for
a
meaner
one
certain
characteristics
that
are
strongest
in
rossetti
art
are
the
outcome
of
the
intensely
human
course
his
imagination
took
his
drawings
are
of
the
kind
that
one
can
live
with
long
looking
into
them
often
one
is
always
rewarded
by
finding
some
new
thing
and
one
thoughts
are
ever
being
arrested
by
new
appreciation
of
some
quaint
conceit
the
depths
of
rossetti
imagination
are
such
in
these
drawings
that
we
may
look
into
them
whilst
watching
the
changes
of
our
own
thought
the
best
that
art
has
given
to
us
has
often
come
from
artists
in
a
quite
way
because
rossetti
genius
was
so
it
is
probable
that
he
could
explain
most
of
what
he
did
to
himself
and
if
in
the
picture
of
which
we
have
been
speaking
we
take
such
a
thing
as
the
alterations
between
the
figures
in
the
background
and
as
they
are
shown
in
the
sketch
it
will
seem
apparent
that
he
gave
reasons
to
himself
for
everything
in
his
compositions
and
did
not
drift
into
anything
by
accident
in
aiming
at
design
in
the
sketch
the
nearest
figure
pursues
the
magdalene
beckoning
in
the
finished
drawing
her
movements
are
arrested
she
and
the
other
figures
pause
before
the
door
speechless
with
cynical
amusement
and
surprise
as
the
magdalene
enters
should
have
wept
her
was
done
as
an
illustration
to
one
of
his
sister
poems
it
represents
the
return
of
the
prince
after
many
delays
to
find
his
lady
has
died
believing
him
unfaithful
the
ugly
drawing
of
the
prince
spoils
an
otherwise
beautiful
design
this
ugliness
is
only
compensated
for
by
the
six
girls
who
turn
their
pitiful
eyes
so
naturally
from
their
prayer
to
look
towards
the
prince
the
grace
of
girlhood
in
their
faces
must
come
as
a
revelation
to
some
of
rossetti
critics
the
illustration
to
tennyson
palace
of
art
should
excite
us
as
curious
and
beautiful
we
have
in
it
one
great
poet
illustration
for
another
poem
made
with
perfect
art
we
have
in
this
drawing
the
echo
of
the
one
imagination
in
the
other
rossetti
has
brought
the
drawing
on
to
the
paper
as
a
dream
an
immense
courage
is
demanded
of
the
artist
when
he
shall
forget
his
reason
for
a
dream
and
when
he
has
the
courage
not
to
reconcile
his
dream
with
the
demands
of
the
prosaic
mind
demanding
only
what
is
prosaic
the
lines
illustrated
are
in
a
city
on
the
sea
near
gilded
her
hair
wound
with
white
roses
slept
cecily
an
angel
look
at
her
the
drawing
interprets
and
it
is
wonderful
that
it
should
do
so
the
imaginative
mood
in
which
we
feel
these
lines
were
written
like
music
they
bring
their
message
in
mystical
sound
one
accepts
their
beauty
feverishly
in
such
a
mood
as
they
invite
reason
greets
imagination
the
words
do
not
represent
things
or
a
place
but
a
mood
and
an
emotion
in
them
is
just
such
a
strange
and
beautiful
medley
as
music
brings
to
us
as
great
art
always
makes
reasonable
to
us
one
thing
we
must
not
forget
in
criticising
rossetti
and
that
is
that
we
are
speaking
of
one
who
was
among
the
first
to
enter
into
the
inheritance
of
his
age
that
on
these
grounds
his
art
is
placed
amongst
the
arts
which
in
every
age
live
by
reason
of
their
significance
commemorated
in
grecian
art
is
the
perfected
form
of
man
as
the
flower
of
animal
evolution
with
this
perfection
attained
another
day
of
creation
was
begun
and
is
continued
in
which
the
things
of
the
spirit
are
being
built
up
until
the
perfect
spirit
is
made
and
just
as
it
was
long
before
man
so
far
awoke
to
a
knowledge
of
the
beauty
which
triumphs
in
him
as
to
worship
his
own
shape
placing
before
himself
his
own
image
as
the
standard
to
which
the
gods
had
led
him
and
from
which
he
might
not
go
back
without
fear
of
their
displeasure
so
not
everywhere
yet
is
the
spirit
of
man
learning
its
own
beauty
from
the
consciousness
of
itself
to
which
it
has
attained
such
art
as
rossetti
with
its
subordination
of
everything
to
an
emotional
and
spiritual
motive
does
certainly
anticipate
as
other
modern
work
like
the
sculpture
of
rodin
anticipates
the
direction
in
which
the
greatness
of
art
in
the
future
must
tend
that
which
is
concerned
with
character
with
all
that
outwardly
gives
indication
of
the
soul
has
appeared
and
triumphantly
throughout
the
history
of
art
a
spirit
changing
its
raiment
the
art
of
rossetti
fails
just
in
so
far
as
its
craftsmanship
is
a
failure
but
its
imperfections
can
not
take
away
its
significance
christianity
made
the
spirit
visible
and
took
serenity
from
the
face
of
art
art
is
spiritualising
itself
by
its
refinements
it
is
perfecting
itself
through
such
an
impressionism
of
the
senses
as
we
have
in
the
art
of
whistler
and
through
the
science
of
the
impressionists
of
france
their
subtleties
are
based
on
the
broad
truths
given
by
masters
long
ago
and
fearful
lest
any
sources
of
our
inspiration
should
be
forgotten
what
is
modern
in
art
has
in
turn
assumed
almost
every
antique
shape
an
old
manner
of
painting
which
was
great
does
not
share
its
greatness
with
the
modern
imitator
but
it
does
not
necessarily
withhold
it
from
him
art
may
clothe
itself
in
some
old
style
as
rossetti
did
and
what
shape
it
takes
whether
based
on
the
old
or
growing
out
of
the
new
does
not
matter
when
it
is
the
messenger
of
inward
things
and
since
no
beauty
of
bodily
form
greater
than
grecian
beauty
is
possible
to
art
that
art
will
be
great
which
betrays
the
flame
the
future
of
life
and
of
art
are
one
it
is
inevitable
that
art
shall
be
great
as
the
spirit
of
man
grows
rich
it
is
for
this
that
we
have
left
behind
the
serenity
which
was
of
greece
and
of
the
partly
awakened
soul
