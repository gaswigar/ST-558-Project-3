i
had
gone
into
the
san
juan
mountains
during
the
first
week
in
march
to
learn
something
of
the
laws
which
govern
snow
slides
to
get
a
fuller
idea
of
their
power
and
destructiveness
and
also
with
the
hope
of
seeing
them
in
wild
magnificent
action
everywhere
except
on
points
the
winter
snows
lay
deep
conditions
for
slide
movement
were
so
favorable
it
seemed
probable
that
during
the
next
few
days
at
least
one
would
run
or
chute
down
every
gulch
that
led
from
the
summit
i
climbed
on
skees
well
to
the
top
of
the
range
by
waiting
on
spurs
and
ridges
i
saw
several
thrilling
exhibitions
it
was
an
exciting
experience
but
at
the
close
of
one
great
day
the
clear
weather
that
had
prevailed
came
to
an
end
from
the
summit
i
watched
hundreds
of
splendid
clouds
slowly
advance
take
their
places
mass
and
form
fluffy
seas
in
valley
and
cañons
just
below
my
level
they
submerged
the
low
places
in
the
plateau
and
torn
masses
of
mists
surrounded
crags
and
headlands
the
sunset
promised
to
be
wonderful
but
suddenly
the
mists
came
surging
past
my
feet
and
threatened
to
shut
out
the
view
hurriedly
climbing
a
promontory
i
watched
from
it
a
sunset
change
and
fade
over
spires
and
swelling
seas
but
the
were
rising
and
suddenly
points
and
peaks
began
to
settle
out
of
sight
then
a
dash
of
frosty
mists
and
my
promontory
sank
into
the
sea
the
light
vanished
from
the
heights
and
i
was
caught
in
dense
frosty
clouds
and
winter
snows
without
a
star
i
had
left
my
skees
at
the
foot
of
the
promontory
and
had
climbed
up
by
fingers
and
toes
over
the
rocks
without
great
difficulty
but
on
starting
to
return
i
could
see
only
a
few
inches
into
the
frosty
clouds
and
quickly
found
that
trying
to
get
down
would
be
a
perilous
pastime
the
side
of
the
promontory
stood
over
the
steep
walls
of
the
plateau
and
not
caring
to
be
tumbled
overboard
by
a
slip
i
concluded
that
sunrise
from
this
point
would
probably
be
worth
while
it
was
not
bitter
cold
and
i
was
comfortably
dressed
however
it
was
necessary
to
do
much
dancing
and
to
keep
warm
snow
began
to
fall
just
after
the
clouds
closed
in
and
it
fell
rapidly
without
a
pause
until
near
morning
early
in
the
evening
i
began
a
mental
review
of
a
number
of
subjects
mingling
with
these
from
time
to
time
vigorous
practice
of
gymnastics
or
calisthenics
to
help
pass
the
night
and
to
aid
in
keeping
warm
the
first
subject
i
thought
through
was
arctic
exploration
then
i
recalled
all
that
my
mind
had
retained
of
countless
stories
of
experiences
the
contents
of
tyndall
hours
of
exercise
in
the
alps
was
most
clearly
recalled
i
was
enjoying
the
poetry
of
burns
when
broken
clouds
and
a
glowing
eastern
sky
claimed
all
attention
until
it
was
light
enough
to
get
off
the
promontory
planning
to
go
down
the
west
side
i
crossed
the
top
found
after
many
trials
a
break
in
the
enormous
and
started
down
the
steep
slope
it
was
a
dangerous
descent
for
the
rock
was
steep
and
smooth
as
a
wall
and
was
overladen
with
snow
which
might
slip
at
any
moment
i
descended
slowly
and
with
great
caution
so
as
not
to
start
the
snow
as
well
as
to
guard
against
slipping
and
losing
control
of
myself
it
was
like
descending
a
mile
of
steep
barn
roof
nothing
to
lay
hold
of
and
omnipresent
opportunity
for
slipping
a
short
distance
below
the
summit
the
clouds
again
were
around
me
and
i
could
see
only
a
short
distance
i
went
sideways
with
my
long
skees
which
i
had
now
regained
at
right
angles
to
the
slope
slowly
a
few
inches
at
a
time
i
eased
myself
down
planting
one
skee
firmly
before
i
moved
the
other
illustration
a
region
near
telluride
colorado
at
last
i
reached
a
point
where
the
wall
was
sufficiently
tilted
to
be
called
a
slope
though
it
was
still
too
steep
for
safe
coasting
the
clouds
lifted
and
were
floating
away
while
the
sun
made
the
mountains
of
snow
still
whiter
i
paused
to
look
back
and
up
to
where
the
wall
ended
in
the
blue
sky
and
could
not
understand
how
i
had
come
safely
down
even
with
the
long
tacks
i
had
made
which
showed
clearly
up
to
the
crags
at
the
summit
i
had
come
down
the
side
of
a
precipitous
amphitheatre
which
rose
a
thousand
feet
or
more
above
me
a
short
distance
down
the
mountain
the
slopes
of
this
amphitheatre
concentrated
in
a
narrow
gulch
that
extended
two
miles
or
more
altogether
it
was
like
being
in
an
enormous
lying
face
up
i
was
in
the
pan
just
above
the
place
where
the
gulch
handle
joined
it
was
a
bad
place
to
get
out
of
and
thousands
of
tons
of
snow
clinging
to
the
steeps
and
sagging
from
corniced
crests
ready
to
slip
plunge
down
and
sweep
the
very
spot
on
which
i
stood
showed
most
impressively
that
it
was
a
perilous
place
to
be
in
as
i
stood
gazing
upward
and
wondering
how
the
snow
ever
could
have
held
while
i
came
down
this
cloud
over
the
crest
in
an
inverted
cascade
all
this
showed
for
a
few
seconds
until
the
snowy
spray
began
to
separate
and
vanish
in
the
air
the
settled
downward
and
began
to
roll
forward
then
monsters
of
massed
snow
appeared
beneath
the
front
of
the
cloud
and
plunged
down
the
slopes
wildly
grandly
they
dragged
the
entire
in
their
wake
at
the
same
instant
the
remainder
of
the
was
suddenly
enveloped
in
another
explosive
effect
a
general
slide
had
started
i
whirled
to
escape
pointed
my
skees
down
the
slope
and
went
in
less
than
half
a
minute
a
tremendous
snow
avalanche
one
hundred
or
perhaps
two
hundred
feet
deep
and
five
or
six
hundred
feet
long
thundered
over
the
spot
where
i
had
stood
there
was
no
chance
to
dodge
no
time
to
climb
out
of
the
way
the
only
hope
of
escape
lay
in
outrunning
the
magnificent
monster
it
came
crashing
and
thundering
after
me
as
swift
as
a
gale
and
more
and
destructive
than
an
earthquake
tidal
wave
i
made
a
desperate
start
friction
almost
ceases
to
be
a
factor
with
skees
on
a
snowy
steep
and
in
less
than
a
hundred
yards
i
was
going
like
the
wind
for
the
first
quarter
of
a
mile
to
the
upper
end
of
the
gulch
was
smooth
coasting
and
down
this
i
shot
with
the
avalanche
with
in
close
pursuit
a
race
for
life
was
on
the
gulch
down
which
i
must
go
began
with
a
rocky
gorge
and
continued
downward
an
enormous
depression
between
high
here
and
there
it
expanded
and
then
contracted
and
it
was
broken
with
granite
crags
and
ribs
it
was
piled
and
bristled
with
ten
thousand
trees
to
coast
through
all
these
obstructions
at
breakneck
speed
would
be
taking
the
maximum
number
of
chances
in
the
minimum
amount
of
time
the
worst
of
it
all
was
that
i
had
never
been
through
the
place
and
bad
enough
too
was
the
fact
that
a
ridge
thrust
in
from
the
left
and
completely
hid
the
beginning
of
the
gulch
as
i
shot
across
the
lower
point
of
the
ridge
about
to
plunge
blindly
into
the
gorge
i
thought
of
the
possibility
of
becoming
entangled
in
the
thickets
of
dwarfed
gnarled
trees
i
also
realized
that
i
might
dash
against
a
cliff
or
plunge
into
a
deep
cañon
of
course
i
might
strike
an
open
way
but
certain
it
was
that
i
could
not
stop
nor
see
the
beginning
of
the
gorge
nor
tell
what
i
should
strike
when
i
shot
over
the
ridge
it
was
a
second
of
most
intense
concern
as
i
cleared
the
ridge
blindly
to
go
into
what
lay
below
and
beyond
it
was
like
leaping
into
the
dark
and
with
the
leap
turning
on
the
light
as
i
cleared
the
ridge
there
was
just
time
to
pull
myself
together
for
a
leap
across
one
arm
of
the
end
of
the
gorge
in
all
my
wild
mountainside
coasts
on
skees
never
have
i
sped
as
swiftly
as
when
i
made
this
mad
flight
as
i
shot
through
the
air
i
had
a
glimpse
down
into
the
pointed
tops
of
a
few
tall
fir
trees
that
were
firmly
rooted
among
the
rocks
in
the
bottom
of
the
gorge
luckily
i
cleared
the
gorge
and
landed
in
a
good
place
but
so
narrowly
did
i
miss
the
corner
of
a
cliff
that
my
shadow
collided
with
it
there
was
no
time
to
bid
farewell
to
fears
when
the
slide
started
nor
to
entertain
them
while
running
away
from
it
instinct
put
me
to
flight
the
situation
set
my
wits
working
at
their
best
and
once
started
i
could
neither
stop
nor
look
back
and
so
thick
and
fast
did
obstructions
and
dangers
rise
before
me
that
only
dimly
and
incidentally
did
i
think
of
the
oncoming
danger
behind
i
came
down
on
the
farther
side
of
the
gorge
to
glance
forward
like
an
arrow
there
was
only
an
instant
to
shape
my
course
and
direct
my
flight
across
the
second
arm
of
the
gorge
over
which
i
leaped
from
a
high
place
sailing
far
above
the
trees
and
boulders
in
the
bottom
my
senses
were
keenly
alert
and
i
remember
noticing
the
shadows
of
the
fir
trees
on
the
white
snow
and
hearing
while
still
in
the
air
the
brave
cheery
notes
of
a
chickadee
then
the
snowslide
on
my
trail
less
than
an
eighth
of
a
mile
behind
plunged
into
the
gorge
with
a
thundering
crash
i
came
back
to
the
snow
on
the
lower
side
and
went
skimming
down
the
slope
with
the
slide
only
a
few
seconds
behind
fortunately
most
of
the
fallen
masses
of
trees
were
buried
though
a
few
broken
limbs
peeped
through
the
snow
to
snag
or
trip
me
how
i
ever
dodged
my
way
through
the
thickly
standing
tree
growths
is
one
feature
of
the
experience
that
was
too
swift
for
recollection
numerous
factors
presented
themselves
which
should
have
done
much
to
dispel
mental
procrastination
and
develop
decision
there
were
scores
of
progressive
propositions
to
decide
within
a
few
seconds
should
i
dodge
that
tree
on
the
left
side
and
duck
under
low
limbs
just
beyond
or
dodge
to
the
right
and
scrape
that
pike
of
rocks
these
with
my
speed
required
instant
decision
and
action
with
almost
uncontrollable
rapidity
i
shot
out
into
a
small
nearly
level
glacier
meadow
and
had
a
brief
rest
from
swift
decisions
and
oncoming
dangers
how
relieved
my
weary
brain
felt
with
nothing
to
decide
about
dodging
as
though
starved
for
thought
material
i
wondered
if
there
were
willows
buried
beneath
the
snow
sharp
pains
in
my
left
hand
compelled
attention
and
showed
my
left
arm
drawn
tightly
against
my
breast
with
fingers
and
thumb
spread
to
the
fullest
and
all
their
muscles
tense
the
lower
edge
of
the
meadow
was
almost
blockaded
with
a
dense
growth
of
trees
fortunately
the
easy
slope
here
had
so
checked
my
speed
that
i
was
able
to
dodge
safely
through
but
the
heavy
slide
swept
across
the
meadow
after
me
with
undiminished
speed
and
came
crashing
into
the
dead
trees
so
close
to
me
that
broken
limbs
were
flung
flying
past
as
i
shot
down
off
a
steep
moraine
less
than
one
hundred
feet
ahead
all
the
way
down
i
had
hoped
to
find
a
side
cañon
into
which
i
might
dodge
i
was
going
too
rapidly
to
enter
the
one
i
had
seen
as
i
coasted
the
moraine
it
flashed
through
my
mind
that
i
had
once
heard
a
prospector
say
it
was
only
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
aspen
gulch
up
to
the
meadows
aspen
gulch
came
in
on
the
right
as
the
now
slightly
widening
track
seemed
to
indicate
at
the
bottom
of
the
moraine
i
was
forced
between
two
trees
that
stood
close
together
and
a
broken
limb
of
one
pierced
my
open
coat
just
beneath
the
left
armhole
and
slit
the
coat
to
the
bottom
my
momentum
and
the
resistance
of
the
strong
material
gave
me
such
a
shock
that
i
was
flung
off
my
balance
and
my
left
skee
smashed
against
a
tree
two
feet
of
the
heel
was
broken
off
and
the
remainder
split
i
managed
to
avoid
falling
but
had
to
check
my
speed
with
my
staff
for
fear
of
a
worse
accident
battling
breakers
with
a
broken
oar
or
racing
with
a
broken
skee
are
struggles
of
short
duration
the
slide
did
not
slow
down
and
so
closely
did
it
crowd
me
that
through
the
crashing
of
trees
as
it
struck
them
down
i
could
hear
the
rocks
and
splintered
timbers
in
its
mass
grinding
together
and
thudding
against
obstructions
over
which
it
swept
these
sounds
and
flying
broken
limbs
cried
to
me
faster
and
as
i
started
to
descend
another
steep
moraine
i
threw
away
my
staff
and
let
go
i
simply
flashed
down
the
slope
dodged
and
rounded
a
cliff
turned
awkwardly
into
aspen
gulch
and
tumbled
heels
over
head
into
safety
then
i
picked
myself
up
to
see
the
slide
go
by
within
twenty
feet
with
great
broken
trees
sticking
out
of
its
side
and
a
dragging
above
little

little

years
ago
while
studying
glaciation
on
the
slope
of
long
peak
i
came
upon
a
cluster
of
eight
beaver
houses
these
crude
conical
mud
huts
were
in
a
forest

far
up
on
the
mountainside
in
this

were
so
many

of

of
the
dead
ice
ruins
and
records
was
indefinitely
given
up
in
order
to
observe
citizen
beaver
works
and
ways
the
industrious
beaver
builds
a
permanent
home
keeps
it
clean
and
in
repair
and
beside
it
stores
food
supplies
for
winter
he
takes
thought
for
the
morrow
these
and
other
commendable
characteristics
give
him
a
place
of
honor
among
the
horde
of
homeless
folk
of
the
wild
his
picturesque
works
add
a
charm
to
nature
and
are
helpful
to
mankind
his
dams
and
ponds
have
saved
vast
areas
of
soil
have
checked
many
a
flood
and
helped
to
equalize
a
pile
of
granite
boulders
on
the
edge
of
the
pond
stood
several
feet
above
the
and
from
the
top
of
these
the
entire
colony
and
its
operations
could
be
seen
on
these
i
spent
days
observing
and
enjoying
the
autumnal
activities
of
beaverdom
it
was
the
busiest
time
of
the
year
for
these
industrious
folk
general
and
extensive
preparations
were
now
being
made
for
the
long
winter
amid
the
mountain
snows
a
harvest
of
scores
of
trees
was
being
gathered
and
work
on
a
new
house
was
in
progress
while
the
old
houses
were
receiving
repairs
it
was
a
serene
autumn
day
when
i
came
into
the
picturesque
village
of
these
primitive
people
the
aspens
were
golden
the
willows
rusty
the
grass
tanned
and
the
pines
were
purring
in
the
easy
air
illustration
mt
meeker
the
was
in
a
small
basin
amid
morainal
débris
at
an
altitude
of
nine
thousand
feet
above
the
i
at
once
christened
it
the
moraine
colony
the
scene
was
utterly
wild
peaks
of
crags
and
snow
rose
steeply
and
high
above
all
around
crowded
a
dense
evergreen
forest
of
pine
and
spruce
a
few
small
swamps
reposed
in
this
forest
while
here
and
there
in
it
bristled
several
gigantic
windrows
of
boulders
a
ragged
belt
of
aspens
surrounded
the
several
ponds
and
separated
the
pines
and
spruces
from
the
fringe
of
willows
along
the
shores
there
were
three
large
ponds
in
succession
and
below
these
a
number
of
smaller
ones
the
dams
that
formed
the
large
ponds
were
earthy
structures
about
four
feet
in
height
and
all
sagged
down
stream
the
houses
were
grouped
in
the
middle
pond
the
largest
one
the
dam
of
which
was
more
than
three
hundred
feet
long
three
of
these
lake
dwellings
stood
near
the
upper
margin
close
to
where
the
brook
poured
in
the
other
five
were
clustered
by
the
outlet
just
below
which
a
small
island
lay
between
the
divided
waters
of
the
stream
a
number
of
beavers
were
busy
gnawing
down
aspens
while
others
cut
the
felled
ones
into
sections
pushed
and
rolled
the
sections
into
the
water
and
then
floated
them
to
the
harvest
piles
one
of
which
was
being
made
beside
each
house
some
were
quietly
at
work
spreading
a
coat
of
mud
on
the
outside
of
each
house
this
would
freeze
and
defy
the
tooth
and
claw
of
the
hungriest
or
the
strongest
predaceous
enemy
four
beavers
were
leisurely
lengthening
and
repairing
a
dam
a
few
worked
singly
but
most
of
them
were
in
groups
all
worked
quietly
and
with
apparent
deliberation
but
all
were
in
motion
so
that
it
was
a
busy
scene
to
work
like
a
beaver
what
a
stirring
exhibition
of
beaver
industry
and
forethought
i
viewed
from
my
at
times
upward
of
forty
of
them
were
in
sight
though
there
was
a
general
coöperation
yet
each
one
appeared
to
do
his
part
without
orders
or
direction
time
and
again
a
group
of
workers
completed
a
task
and
without
pause
silently
moved
off
and
began
another
everything
appeared
to
go
on
mechanically
it
produced
a
strange
feeling
to
see
so
many
workers
doing
so
many
kinds
of
work
effectively
and
automatically
again
and
again
i
listened
for
the
superintendent
voice
constantly
i
watched
to
see
the
overseer
move
among
them
but
i
listened
and
watched
in
vain
yet
i
feel
that
some
of
the
patriarchal
fellows
must
have
carried
a
general
plan
of
the
work
and
that
during
its
progress
orders
and
directions
that
i
could
not
comprehend
were
given
from
time
to
time
the
work
was
at
its
height
a
little
before
midday
nowadays
it
is
rare
for
a
beaver
to
work
in
daylight
men
and
guns
have
prevented
daylight
workers
from
leaving
descendants
these
not
only
worked
but
played
by
day
one
morning
for
more
than
an
hour
there
was
a
general
frolic
in
which
the
entire
population
appeared
to
take
part
they
raced
dived
crowded
in
general
whacked
the
water
with
their
tails
wrestled
and
dived
again
there
were
two
or
three
but
the
play
went
on
without
intermission
and
as
their
position
constantly
changed
the
merrymakers
splashed
water
all
over
the
main
pond
before
they
calmed
down
and
in
silence
returned
to
work
i
gave
most
attention
to
the
harvesters
who
felled
the
aspens
and
moved
them
bodily
or
in
sections
by
land
and
water
to
the
harvest
piles
one
tree
on
the
shore
of
the
pond
which
was
felled
into
the
water
was
eight
inches
in
diameter
and
fifteen
feet
high
without
having
even
a
limb
cut
off
it
was
floated
to
the
nearest
harvest
pile
another
about
the
same
size
which
was
procured
some
fifty
feet
from
the
water
was
cut
into
four
sections
and
its
branches
removed
then
a
single
beaver
would
take
a
branch
in
his
teeth
drag
it
to
the
water
and
swim
with
it
to
a
harvest
pile
but
four
beavers
united
to
transport
the
largest
section
to
the
water
they
pushed
with
fore
paws
with
breasts
and
with
hips
plainly
it
was
too
heavy
for
them
they
paused
now
they
will
go
for
help
i
said
to
myself
and
i
shall
find
out
who
the
boss
is
but
to
my
astonishment
one
of
them
began
to
gnaw
the
piece
in
two
and
two
more
began
to
clear
a
narrow
way
to
the
water
while
the
fourth
set
himself
to
cutting
down
another
aspen
good
roads
and
open
waterways
are
the
rule
and
perhaps
the
necessary
rule
of
beaver
colonies
i
was
impatient
to
have
a
close
view
of
a
beaver
cutting
down
a
tree
and
at
last
one
came
prospecting
near
where
i
was
hidden
after
a
prolonged
period
of
repose
and
possibly
reflection
he
rose
gazed
into
the
treetop
as
though
to
see
if
it
were
entangled
then
put
his
fore
paws
against
the
tree
spread
his
hind
legs
sat
back
on
his
extended
tail
and
took
a
bite
from
the
trunk
everything
in
his
actions
suggested
that
his
only
intention
was
to
devour
the
tree
deliberately
he
did
most
of
the
cutting
from
one
side
occasionally
he
pulled
out
a
chip
by
leaning
backward
sometimes
he
pried
it
out
by
tilting
his
head
to
the
horizontal
forcing
his
lower
front
teeth
behind
it
then
splitting
it
out
by
using
his
jaws
as
a
lever
he
was
a
trifle
more
than
an
hour
in
felling
a
tree
just
before
it
fell
he
thudded
the
ground
a
few
times
with
his
tail
and
ran
away
i
became
deeply
interested
in
this
colony
which
was
situated
within
two
miles
of
my
cabin
and
its
nearness
enabled
me
to
be
a
frequent
visitor
and
to
follow
closely
its
fortunes
and
misfortunes
about
the
pond
i
lingered
when
it
was
covered
with
winter
white
when
fringed
with
the
gentian
blue
and
while
decked
with
the
yellow
glory
ruin
befell
it
before
my
first
visit
ended
one
morning
while
watching
from
the
i
noticed
an
occasional
flake
of
ash
dropping
into
the
pond
soon
smoke
scented
the
air
then
came
the
awful
and
subdued
roar
of
a
forest
fire
i
fled
and
from
above
the
watched
the
of
black
smoke
sweep
furiously
forward
bursting
and
closing
to
the
terrible
leaps
of
red
and
tattered
flames
before
noon
several
thousand
acres
of
forest
were
dead
all
leaves
and
twigs
were
in
ashes
all
blistered
and
blackened
the
moraine
colony
was
closely
embowered
in
a
pitchy
forest
for
a
time
the
houses
in
the
water
must
have
been
wrapped
in
flames
of
smelter
heat
could
these
mud
houses
stand
this
the
beavers
themselves
i
knew
would
escape
by
sinking
under
the
water
next
morning
i
went
through
the
hot
smoky
area
and
found
every
house
cracked
and
crumbling
not
one
was
inhabitable
most
serious
of
all
was
the
total
loss
of
the
uncut
food
supply
when
harvesting
for
winter
had
only
begun
would
these
energetic
people
starve
at
home
or
would
they
try
to
find
refuge
in
some
other
colony
would
they
endeavor
to
find
a
grove
that
the
fire
had
missed
and
there
start
anew
the
intense
heat
had
consumed
almost
every
fibrous
thing
above
the
surface
the
piles
of
garnered
green
aspen
were
charred
to
the
all
that
remained
of
willow
thickets
and
aspen
groves
were
thousands
of
blackened
pickets
and
points
acres
of
coarse
charcoal
stubble
it
was
a
dreary
starving
outlook
for
my
furred
friends
i
left
the
scene
to
explore
the
entire
burned
area
after
wandering
for
hours
amid
ashes
and
charcoal
seeing
here
and
there
the
seared
carcass
of
a
deer
or
some
other
wild
animal
i
came
upon
a
beaver
colony
that
had
escaped
the
fire
it
was
in
the
midst
of
several
acres
of
swampy
ground
that
was
covered
with
willows
and
aspens
the
surrounding
pine
forest
was
not
dense
and
the
heat
it
produced
in
burning
did
no
damage
to
the
scattered
beaver
houses
from
the
top
of
a
granite
crag
i
surveyed
the
green
scene
of
life
and
the
surrounding
sweep
of
desolation
here
and
there
a
sodden
log
smouldered
in
the
ashen
distance
and
supported
a
tower
of
smoke
in
the
still
air
a
few
miles
to
the
east
among
the
scattered
trees
of
a
rocky
summit
the
fire
was
burning
itself
out
to
the
west
the
sun
was
sinking
behind
crags
and
snow
on
a
blackened
limb
a
robin
chattered
volubly
but
hopelessly
while
i
was
listening
thinking
and
watching
a
mountain
lion
appeared
and
leaped
lightly
upon
a
block
of
granite
he
was
on
my
right
about
one
hundred
feet
away
and
about
an
equal
distance
from
the
shore
of
the
nearest
pond
he
was
interested
in
the
approach
of
something
with
a
nervous
switching
of
his
tail
he
peered
eagerly
forward
over
the
crown
of
the
ridge
just
before
him
and
then
crouched
tensely
and
expectantly
upon
his
rock
a
pine
tree
that
had
escaped
the
fire
screened
the
place
toward
which
the
lion
looked
and
where
something
evidently
was
approaching
while
i
was
trying
to
discover
what
it
could
be
a
coyote
trotted
into
view
without
catching
sight
of
the
lion
he
suddenly
stopped
and
fixed
his
gaze
upon
the
point
that
so
interested
the
crouching
beast
the
mystery
was
solved
when
thirty
or
forty
beavers
came
hurrying
into
view
they
had
come
from
the
ruined
moraine
colony
i
thought
to
myself
that
the
coyote
stuffed
as
he
must
be
with
the
seared
flesh
of
victims
would
not
attack
them
but
a
lion
wants
a
fresh
kill
for
every
meal
and
so
i
watched
the
movements
of
the
latter
he
adjusted
his
feet
a
trifle
and
made
ready
to
spring
the
beavers
were
getting
close
but
just
as
i
was
about
to
shout
to
frighten
him
the
coyote
leaped
among
them
and
began
killing
in
the
excitement
of
getting
off
the
crag
i
narrowly
escaped
breaking
my
neck
once
on
the
ground
i
ran
for
the
coyote
shouting
wildly
to
frighten
him
off
but
he
was
so
intent
upon
killing
that
a
violent
kick
in
the
ribs
first
made
him
aware
of
my
presence
in
anger
and
excitement
he
leaped
at
me
with
ugly
teeth
as
he
fled
the
lion
had
disappeared
and
by
this
time
the
beavers
in
the
front
ranks
were
jumping
into
the
pond
while
the
others
were
awkwardly
speeding
down
the
slope
the
coyote
had
killed
three
if
beavers
have
a
language
surely
that
night
the
refugees
related
to
their
hospitable
neighbors
some
thrilling
experiences
the
next
morning
i
returned
to
the
moraine
colony
over
the
route
followed
by
the
refugees
leaving
their
homes
they
had
followed
the
stream
that
issued
from
their
ponds
in
places
the
channel
was
so
clogged
with
fire
wreckage
that
they
had
followed
alongside
the
water
rather
than
in
it
as
is
their
wont
at
one
place
they
had
hurriedly
taken
refuge
in
the
stream
coyote
tracks
in
the
scattered
ashes
explained
this
but
after
going
a
short
distance
they
had
climbed
from
the
water
and
again
traveled
the
ashy
earth
beavers
like
fish
commonly
follow
water
routes
but
in
times
of
emergency
or
in
moments
of
audacity
they
will
journey
overland
to
have
followed
this
stream
down
to
its
first
tributary
then
up
this
to
where
the
colony
in
which
they
found
refuge
was
situated
would
have
required
four
miles
of
travel
overland
it
was
less
than
a
mile
after
following
the
stream
for
some
distance
at
just
the
right
place
they
turned
off
left
the
stream
and
dared
the
overland
dangers
how
did
they
know
the
situation
of
the
colony
in
the
willows
or
that
it
had
escaped
fire
and
how
could
they
have
known
the
shortest
best
way
to
it
the
morning
after
the
arrival
of
the
refugees
work
was
begun
on
two
new
houses
and
a
dam
which
was
about
sixty
feet
in
length
and
built
across
a
grassy
open
green
cuttings
of
willow
aspen
and
alder
were
used
in
its
construction
not
a
single
stone
or
a
handful
of
mud
was
used
when
completed
it
appeared
like
a
windrow
of
freshly
raked
shrubs
it
was
almost
straight
but
sagged
a
trifle
downstream
though
the
water
filtered
freely
through
it
flooded
the
flat
above
as
the
two
new
houses
could
not
shelter
all
the
refugees
it
is
probable
that
some
of
them
were
sheltered
in
bank
tunnels
while
room
for
others
may
have
been
found
in
the
old
houses
that
winter
the
colony
was
raided
by
some
trappers
more
than
one
hundred
pelts
were
secured
and
the
colony
was
left
in
ruins
and
almost
depopulated
the
moraine
colony
site
was
deserted
for
a
long
time
eight
years
after
the
fire
i
returned
to
examine
it
the
willow
growth
about
the
ruins
was
almost
as
thrifty
as
when
the
fire
came
a
growth
of
aspen
taller
than
one
head
clung
to
the
old
while
a
close
seedling
growth
of
pine
throve
in
the
ashes
of
the
old
forest
one
low
mound
merry
with
blooming
columbine
was
the
only
house
ruin
to
be
seen
the
ponds
were
empty
and
every
dam
was
broken
the
stream
in
rushing
unobstructed
through
the
ruins
had
eroded
deeply
this
erosion
revealed
the
records
of
ages
and
showed
that
the
old
main
dam
had
been
built
on
the
top
of
an
older
dam
and
a
pond
the
second
dam
was
on
top
of
an
older
one
still
in
the
sediment
of
the
oldest
the
bottom
pond
i
found
a
two
charred
logs
and
the
skull
of
a
buffalo
colonies
of
beaver
as
well
as
those
of
men
are
often
found
upon
sites
that
have
a
tragic
history
beavers
with
omar
might
say
when
you
and
i
behind
the
veil
are
past
oh
but
the
long
long
while
the
world
shall
last
the
next
summer
the
moraine
site
was
resettled
during
the
first
season
the
colonists
put
in
their
time
repairing
dams
and
were
content
to
live
in
holes
in
autumn
they
gathered
no
harvest
and
no
trace
of
them
could
be
found
after
the
snow
so
it
is
likely
that
they
had
returned
to
winter
in
the
colony
whence
they
had
come
but
early
in
the
next
spring
there
were
reinforced
numbers
of
them
at
work
establishing
a
permanent
settlement
three
dams
were
repaired
and
in
the
autumn
many
of
the
golden
leaves
that
fell
found
lodgment
in
the
fresh
plaster
of
two
new
houses
most
beaver
dams
are
built
on
the
installment
plan
are
the
result
of
growth
as
the
pond
fills
with
sediment
and
the
water
becomes
shallower
the
dam
is
built
higher
and
where
conditions
require
it
longer
or
as
is
often
the
case
it
may
be
raised
and
lengthened
for
the
purpose
of
raising
or
backing
water
to
the
trees
that
are
next
to
be
harvested
the
dams
are
made
of
sticks
small
trees
sods
mud
stones
coal
grass
roots
that
is
combinations
of
these
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
houses
for
either
house
or
dam
the
most
convenient
material
is
likely
to
be
used
but
this
is
not
always
the
case
for
the
situation
of
the
house
or
what
the
dam
may
have
to
endure
evidently
is
sometimes
considered
and
apparently
that
kind
of
material
is
used
that
will
best
meet
all
the
requirements
most
beaver
dams
are
so
situated
that
they
are
destined
earlier
or
later
to
accumulate
sediment
trash
and
fallen
leaves
and
become
earthy
then
they
will
of
course
be
planted
by
nature
with
grass
shrubby
willows
and
even
trees
i
have
seen
many
trees
with
nests
in
them
standing
on
a
beaver
dam
yet
the
original
dam
had
been
composed
almost
entirely
of
sticks
or
stones
why
do
beavers
want
or
need
ponds
they
have
very
heavy
bodies
and
extremely
short
legs
on
land
they
are
slow
and
awkward
and
in
the
greatest
danger
from
their
enemies
wolves
lions
bears
and
wildcats
but
they
are
excellent
swimmers
and
in
water
they
easily
elude
their
enemies
and
through
it
they
conveniently
bring
their
harvests
home
water
is
necessary
for
their
existence
and
to
have
this
at
all
times
compels
the
construction
of
dams
and
ponds
in
the
new
moraine
colony
one
of
the
houses
was
torn
to
pieces
by
some
animal
probably
a
bear
this
was
before
thanksgiving
about
midwinter
a
prospector
left
his
tunnel
a
few
miles
away
came
to
the
colony
and
dynamited
a
house
and
got
seven
of
them
next
year
two
houses
were
built
on
the
ruins
of
the
two
just
fallen
that
year
was
broken
by
deadly
attacks
of
enemies
in
gathering
the
harvest
the
beavers
showed
a
preference
for
some
aspens
that
were
growing
in
a
moist
place
about
one
hundred
feet
from
the
water
whether
it
was
the
size
of
these
or
their
peculiar
flavor
that
determined
their
election
in
preference
to
nearer
ones
i
could
not
determine
one
day
while
several
beavers
were
cutting
here
they
were
surprised
by
a
mountain
lion
which
leaped
upon
and
killed
one
of
the
harvesters
the
next
day
the
lion
surprised
and
killed
another
two
or
three
days
later
a
coyote
killed
one
on
the
same
spot
and
then
overtook
and
killed
two
others
as
they
fled
for
the
water
i
could
not
see
these
deadly
attacks
from
the
but
in
each
case
the
sight
of
flying
beavers
sent
me
rushing
upon
the
scene
where
i
beheld
the
cause
of
their
desperate
retreat
but
despite
dangers
they
persisted
until
the
last
of
these
aspens
was
harvested
during
the
winter
the
bark
was
eaten
from
these
and
the
next
season
their
clean
wood
was
used
in
the
walls
of
a
new
house
one
spring
i
several
times
visited
a
number
of
colonies
while
trying
to
determine
the
number
of
young
brought
forth
at
a
birth
six
furry
little
fellows
sunning
themselves
on
top
of
their
rude
home
were
the
first
discovery
this
was
the
twelfth
of
may
by
the
close
of
the
month
i
had
come
in
sight
of
many
youngsters
and
found
the
average
number
to
be
five
one
mother
proudly
exhibited
eight
while
another
one
who
all
winter
had
been
harassed
by
trappers
and
who
lived
in
a
burrow
on
the
bank
could
display
but
one
in
the
moraine
colony
the
three
sets
of
youngsters
numbered
two
three
and
five
great
times
these
had
as
they
were
growing
up
they
played
over
the
house
and
such
fun
they
had
nosing
and
pushing
each
other
off
a
large
boulder
into
the
water
a
thousand
merry
ripples
they
sent
to
the
shore
as
they
raced
wrestled
and
dived
in
the
pond
both
in
the
sunshine
and
in
the
shadows
of
the
willows
along
the
shore
the
beaver
has
a
rich
birthright
though
born
in
a
windowless
hut
of
mud
close
to
the
primitive
place
of
his
birth
the
wild
folk
of
both
woods
and
water
meet
and
often
mingle
around
it
are
the
scenes
and
silences
of
the
water
or
the
shore
he
grows
up
with
the
wild
playing
amid
the
enameled
flowers
the
great
boulders
the
ice
king
marbles
and
the
fallen
logs
in
the
edge
of
the
mysterious
forest
learning
to
swim
and
slide
listening
to
the
strong
harmonious
stir
of
wind
and
water
living
with
the
stars
in
the
sky
and
the
stars
in
the
pond
beginning
serious
life
when
brilliant
clouds
of
color
enrich
the
hills
helping
to
harvest
the
trees
that
wear
the
robes
of
gold
while
the
birds
go
by
for
the
southland
in
the
reflective
autumn
days
if
mother
nature
should
ever
call
me
to
live
upon
another
planet
i
could
wish
that
i
might
be
born
a
beaver
to
inhabit
a
house
in
the
water
the
autumn
of
the
year
when
i
watched
the
young
beavers
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
some
immigrants
pass
me
for
a
new
home
in
the
moraine
colony
of
course
they
may
have
been
only
visitors
or
have
come
temporarily
to
assist
in
the
harvesting
but
i
like
to
think
of
them
as
immigrants
and
a
number
of
things
testified
that
immigrants
they
were
one
evening
i
had
long
been
lying
on
a
boulder
by
the
stream
below
the
colony
waiting
for
a
gift
from
the
gods
it
came
out
of
the
water
within
ten
feet
of
me
scrambled
the
most
patriarchal
as
well
as
the
largest
beaver
that
i
have
ever
seen
i
wanted
to
take
off
my
hat
to
him
i
wanted
to
ask
him
to
tell
me
the
story
of
his
life
but
from
long
habit
i
simply
lay
still
and
watched
and
thought
in
silence
he
was
making
a
portage
round
a
cascade
as
he
scrambled
up
over
the
rocks
i
noticed
that
he
had
but
two
fingers
on
his
right
hand
he
was
followed
in
single
file
by
four
others
one
of
these
was
minus
a
finger
on
the
left
hand
the
next
morning
i
read
that
five
immigrants
had
arrived
in
the
moraine
colony
they
had
registered
their
footprints
in
the
muddy
margin
of
the
lower
pond
had
an
agent
been
sent
to
invite
these
colonists
or
had
they
come
out
of
their
own
adventurous
spirit
the
day
following
their
arrival
i
trailed
them
backward
in
the
hope
of
learning
whence
they
came
and
why
they
had
moved
they
had
traveled
in
the
water
most
of
the
time
but
in
places
they
had
come
out
on
the
bank
to
go
round
a
waterfall
or
to
avoid
an
obstruction
here
and
there
i
saw
their
tracks
in
the
mud
and
traced
them
to
a
beaver
settlement
in
which
the
houses
and
dams
had
been
recently
wrecked
a
rancher
told
me
that
he
had
been
making
it
hot
for
all
beavers
in
his
meadow
during
the
next
two
years
i
occasionally
saw
this
patriarchal
beaver
or
his
tracks
thereabout
illustration
a
beaver
house
in
winter
it
is
the
custom
among
old
male
beavers
to
idle
away
two
or
three
months
of
each
summer
in
exploring
the
neighboring
brooks
and
streams
but
they
never
fail
to
return
in
time
for
autumn
activities
it
thus
becomes
plain
how
when
an
old
colony
needs
to
move
some
one
in
it
knows
where
to
go
and
the
route
to
follow
i
had
enjoyed
the
ways
of
our
first
engineers
for
several
years
before
it
dawned
upon
me
that
their
works
might
be
useful
to
man
and
that
the
beaver
might
justly
be
called
the
first
conservationist
one
dry
winter
the
stream
through
the
moraine
colony
ran
low
and
froze
to
the
bottom
and
the
only
trout
in
it
that
survived
were
those
in
the
deep
holes
of
these
beaver
ponds
another
demonstration
of
their
usefulness
came
one
gray
day
the
easy
rain
of
two
days
ended
in
a
heavy
downpour
and
a
deluge
of
water
on
the
mountainside
above
this
was
still
barren
from
the
forest
fire
it
had
but
little
to
absorb
or
delay
the
excess
of
water
which
was
speedily
shed
into
the
stream
below
flooding
down
the
stream
channel
came
a
roaring
avalanche
or
waterslide
with
a
front
that
was
five
or
six
feet
high
this
expanded
as
it
rolled
into
the
pond
and
swept
far
out
on
the
sides
while
the
front
greatly
lowered
rushed
over
the
dam
much
of
this
water
was
caught
and
temporarily
detained
in
the
ponds
and
by
the
time
it
poured
over
the
last
dam
its
volume
was
greatly
reduced
and
its
speed
checked
the
ponds
had
broken
the
rush
and
prevented
a
flood
every
beaver
pond
is
a
that
takes
sediment
and
soil
from
the
water
that
passes
through
it
if
this
soil
were
carried
down
it
would
not
only
be
lost
but
it
would
clog
the
deep
waterway
the
river
channel
deposited
in
the
pond
it
will
in
time
become
productive
during
past
ages
the
millions
of
beaver
dams
in
the
united
states
have
spread
soil
over
thousands
of
square
miles
and
rendered
them
productive
beavers
prepared
the
way
for
numerous
forests
and
meadows
for
countless
orchards
and
peaceful
productive
valleys
the
moraine
colonists
gathered
an
unusually
large
harvest
during
the
autumn
of
seven
hundred
and
sapling
aspens
and
several
hundred
willows
were
massed
in
the
main
pond
by
the
largest
house
this
pile
which
was
mostly
below
the
was
three
feet
deep
and
one
hundred
and
feet
in
circumference
would
a
new
house
be
built
this
fall
this
unusually
large
harvest
plainly
told
that
either
children
or
immigrants
had
increased
the
population
of
the
colony
of
course
a
hard
winter
may
also
have
been
expected
no
they
were
not
to
build
a
new
house
but
the
old
house
by
the
harvest
pile
was
to
be
enlarged
one
day
just
as
the
evening
shadow
of
long
peak
had
covered
the
pond
i
peeped
over
a
log
on
top
of
the
dam
to
watch
the
work
the
house
was
only
forty
feet
distant
not
a
ripple
stirred
among
the
inverted
peaks
and
pines
in
the
clear
pond
a
lone
beaver
rose
quietly
in
the
scene
from
the
water
near
the
house
swimming
noiselessly
he
made
a
circuit
of
the
pond
then
for
a
time
and
without
any
apparent
purpose
he
swam
back
and
forth
over
a
short
straight
course
he
moved
leisurely
and
occasionally
made
a
shallow
quiet
dive
he
did
not
appear
to
be
watching
anything
in
particular
or
to
have
anything
special
on
his
mind
yet
his
eyes
may
have
been
scouting
for
enemies
and
his
mind
may
have
been
full
of
house
plans
finally
he
dived
deeply
and
the
next
i
saw
of
him
he
was
climbing
up
the
side
of
the
house
addition
with
a
pawful
of
mud
by
this
time
a
number
of
beavers
were
swimming
in
the
pond
after
the
manner
of
the
first
one
presently
all
began
to
work
the
addition
already
stood
more
than
two
feet
above
the
the
top
of
this
was
and
was
about
seven
feet
long
and
half
as
wide
it
was
made
mostly
of
mud
which
was
plentifully
reinforced
with
willow
cuttings
and
aspen
sticks
for
a
time
all
the
workers
busied
themselves
in
carrying
mud
and
roots
from
the
bottom
of
the
pond
and
placing
these
on
the
slowly
rising
addition
eleven
were
working
at
one
time
by
and
by
three
swam
ashore
each
in
a
different
direction
and
each
a
few
seconds
apart
after
a
minute
or
two
they
returned
from
the
shore
each
carrying
or
trailing
a
long
willow
these
were
dragged
to
the
top
of
the
addition
laid
down
and
trampled
in
the
mud
meantime
the
kept
steadily
at
their
work
again
willows
were
brought
but
this
time
four
beavers
went
and
as
before
each
was
independent
of
the
others
i
did
not
see
how
this
work
could
go
on
without
some
one
bossing
the
thing
but
i
failed
to
detect
any
beaver
acting
as
overseer
while
there
was
general
coöperation
each
acted
independently
most
of
the
time
and
sometimes
was
apparently
oblivious
of
the
others
these
beavers
simply
worked
slowly
silently
and
steadily
and
they
were
still
working
away
methodically
and
with
dignified
deliberation
when
darkness
hid
them
most
beaver
houses
are
conical
and
round
of
outline
this
house
originally
was
slightly
elliptical
and
measured
feet
in
circumference
after
enlargement
it
was
almost
a
flattened
ellipse
and
measured
feet
in
circumference
generally
i
have
found
that
small
beaver
houses
are
round
and
large
ones
elliptical
one
of
the
last
large
interesting
works
of
the
moraine
colony
was
the
making
of
a
new
pond
this
was
made
alongside
the
main
pond
and
about
fifty
feet
distant
from
it
a
low
ridge
separated
the
two
as
it
was
nearly
one
hundred
feet
from
the
stream
a
ditch
or
canal
was
dug
from
the
stream
below
the
main
pond
to
fill
it
the
new
pond
was
made
for
the
purpose
of
reaching
with
a
waterway
an
aspen
grove
on
its
farther
shore
the
making
of
the
dam
showed
more
forethought
than
the
getting
of
the
water
into
the
pond
with
the
exception
of
aspen
no
material
such
as
beavers
commonly
use
was
to
be
found
the
population
of
the
colony
was
now
large
while
aspen
the
chief
was
becoming
scarce
would
the
beavers
see
far
enough
ahead
to
realize
this
evidently
they
did
at
any
rate
not
a
single
precious
aspen
was
used
in
making
the
dam
close
to
the
was
a
supply
of
young
pines
but
it
is
against
the
tradition
of
the
beaver
to
cut
green
pines
or
spruces
two
of
these
were
cut
but
evidently
these
pitchy
smelly
things
were
not
to
the
beavers
taste
and
no
more
of
them
were
used
not
far
away
were
scores
of
trees
both
standing
and
fallen
surely
i
said
to
myself
when
two
dead
chunks
had
been
dragged
into
place
they
are
not
going
to
use
this
dead
timber
a
beaver
avoids
gnawing
dead
wood
it
is
slow
work
and
besides
is
very
hard
on
the
teeth
most
of
these
dead
trees
were
inconveniently
large
and
were
and
full
of
but
contrary
to
all
my
years
of
observation
they
after
long
hard
labor
built
an
excellent
dam
from
this
material
i
have
determined
to
do
all
i
can
to
perpetuate
the
beaver
and
i
wish
i
could
interest
every
man
woman
boy
and
girl
in
the
land
to
help
in
this
beaver
works
are
so
picturesque
and
so
useful
to
man
that
i
trust
this
persistent
practicer
of
conservation
will
not
perish
from
the
hills
and
mountains
of
our
land
his
growing
scarcity
is
awakening
some
interest
in
him
and
i
hope
and
half
believe
that
before
many
years
every
brook
that
is
born
on
a
great
watershed
will
as
it
goes
swiftly
merrily
singing
down
the
slopes
toward
the
sea
pass
through
and
be
steadied
in
a
poetic
pond
that
is
made
and
will
be
maintained
by
our
patient
persistent
faithful
friend
the
beaver
harvest
time
with
beavers
harvest
time
with
beavers
one
autumn
i
watched
a
beaver
colony
and
observed
the
customs
of
its
primitive
inhabitants
as
they
gathered
their
harvest
for
winter
it
was
the
spruce
tree
colony
the
most
attractive
one
of
the
sixteen
beaver
municipalities
on
the
big
moraine
on
the
slope
of
long
peak
the
first
evening
i
concealed
myself
close
to
the
beaver
house
by
the
edge
of
the
pond
just
at
sunset
a
large
aged
beaver
of
striking
patriarchal
appearance
rose
in
the
water
by
the
house
and
swam
slowly
silently
round
the
pond
he
kept
close
to
the
shore
and
appeared
to
be
scouting
to
see
if
an
enemy
lurked
near
on
completing
the
circuit
of
the
pond
he
climbed
upon
the
end
of
a
log
that
was
thrust
a
few
feet
out
into
the
water
presently
several
other
beaver
appeared
in
the
water
close
to
the
house
a
few
of
these
at
once
left
the
pond
and
nosed
quietly
about
on
the
shore
the
others
swam
about
for
some
minutes
and
then
joined
their
comrades
on
land
where
all
rested
for
a
time
meanwhile
the
aged
beaver
had
lifted
a
small
aspen
limb
out
of
the
water
and
was
squatted
on
the
log
leisurely
eating
bark
before
many
minutes
elapsed
the
other
beaver
became
restless
and
finally
started
up
the
slope
in
a
runway
they
traveled
slowly
in
single
file
and
one
by
one
vanished
amid
the
tall
sedge
the
old
beaver
slipped
noiselessly
into
the
water
and
a
series
of
low
waves
pointed
toward
the
house
it
was
dark
as
i
stole
away
in
silence
for
the
night
and
mars
was
gently
throbbing
in
the
black
water
this
was
an
old
beaver
settlement
and
the
numerous
harvests
gathered
by
its
inhabitants
had
long
since
exhausted
the
growths
of
aspen
the
bark
of
which
is
the
favorite
food
of
north
american
beaver
though
the
bark
of
willow
cottonwood
alder
and
birch
is
also
eaten
an
examination
of
the
aspen
supply
together
with
the
lines
of
transportation
the
runways
canals
and
ponds
indicated
that
this
year
harvest
would
have
to
be
brought
a
long
distance
the
place
it
would
come
from
was
an
aspen
grove
far
up
the
slope
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
from
the
main
house
and
perhaps
a
hundred
and
twenty
feet
above
it
in
this
grove
i
cut
three
notches
in
the
trunks
of
several
trees
to
enable
me
to
identify
them
whether
in
the
garnered
pile
by
a
house
or
along
the
line
of
transportation
to
it
the
grounds
of
this
colony
occupied
several
acres
on
a
terraced
moderately
steep
slope
of
a
mountain
moraine
along
one
side
rushed
a
swift
stream
on
which
the
colonists
maintained
three
but
little
used
ponds
on
the
opposite
side
were
the
slope
and
summit
of
the
moraine
there
was
a
large
pond
at
the
bottom
and
one
or
two
small
ponds
or
basins
dotted
each
of
the
five
terraces
which
rose
above
the
entire
grounds
were
perforated
with
subterranean
passageways
or
tunnels
beaver
commonly
fill
their
ponds
by
damming
a
brook
or
a
river
but
this
colony
obtained
most
of
its
from
springs
poured
forth
abundantly
on
the
uppermost
terrace
where
the
water
was
led
into
one
pond
and
a
number
of
basins
overflowing
from
these
it
either
made
a
merry
tiny
cascade
or
went
to
lubricate
a
slide
on
the
short
slopes
which
led
to
the
ponds
on
the
terrace
below
the
waters
from
all
terraces
were
gathered
into
a
large
pond
at
the
bottom
this
pond
measured
six
hundred
feet
in
circumference
the
crooked
and
almost
encircling
dam
was
six
feet
high
and
four
hundred
feet
long
in
its
upper
edge
stood
the
main
house
which
was
eighty
feet
high
and
forty
feet
in
circumference
there
was
also
another
house
on
one
of
the
terraces
after
notching
the
aspens
i
spent
some
time
exploring
the
colony
grounds
and
did
not
return
to
the
marked
trees
until
hours
had
elapsed
harvest
had
begun
and
one
of
the
largest
notched
trees
had
been
felled
and
removed
its
gnawed
stump
was
six
inches
in
diameter
and
stood
fifteen
inches
high
the
limbs
had
been
trimmed
off
and
a
number
of
these
lay
scattered
about
the
stump
the
trunk
which
must
have
been
about
eighteen
feet
long
had
disappeared
cut
into
lengths
of
from
three
to
six
feet
probably
and
started
toward
the
harvest
pile
wondering
for
which
house
these
logs
were
intended
i
followed
hoping
to
trace
and
trail
them
to
the
house
or
find
them
from
the
spot
where
they
were
cut
they
had
evidently
been
rolled
down
a
steep
grassy
slope
at
the
bottom
of
this
dragged
an
equal
distance
over
a
level
stretch
among
some
pines
and
then
pushed
or
dragged
along
a
narrow
runway
that
had
been
cut
through
a
rank
growth
of
willows
once
through
the
willows
they
were
pushed
into
the
uppermost
pond
they
were
taken
across
this
forced
over
the
dam
on
the
opposite
side
and
shot
down
a
slide
into
the
pond
which
contained
the
smaller
house
only
hours
before
the
little
logs
which
i
was
following
were
in
a
tree
and
now
i
expected
to
find
them
by
this
house
it
was
good
work
to
have
got
them
here
so
quickly
i
thought
but
no
logs
could
be
found
by
the
house
or
in
the
pond
the
folks
at
this
place
had
not
yet
laid
up
anything
for
winter
the
logs
must
have
gone
farther
on
the
opposite
side
of
this
pond
i
found
where
the
logs
had
been
dragged
across
the
broad
dam
and
then
heaved
into
a
long
wet
slide
which
landed
them
in
a
small
shallow
harbor
in
the
grass
from
this
point
a
canal
about
eighty
feet
long
ran
around
the
brow
of
the
terrace
and
ended
at
the
top
of
a
long
slide
which
reached
to
the
big
pond
this
canal
was
new
and
probably
had
been
dug
especially
for
this
harvest
for
sixty
feet
of
its
length
it
was
quite
regular
in
form
and
had
an
average
width
of
thirty
inches
and
a
depth
of
fourteen
the
mud
dug
in
making
it
was
piled
evenly
along
the
lower
side
altogether
it
looked
more
like
the
work
of
a
careful
man
with
a
shovel
than
of
beaver
without
tools
seepage
and
overflow
water
from
the
ponds
above
filled
and
flowed
slowly
through
it
and
out
at
the
farther
end
where
it
swept
down
the
long
slide
into
the
big
pond
through
this
canal
the
logs
had
been
taken
one
by
one
at
the
farther
end
i
found
the
log
it
probably
had
been
too
heavy
to
heave
out
of
the
canal
but
tracks
in
the
mud
indicated
that
there
was
a
hard
tussle
before
it
was
abandoned

the
pile
of
winter
supplies
was
started
close
to
the
big
house
a
few
aspen
leaves
fluttered
on
twigs
in
the
water
evidently
these
twigs
were
attached
to
limbs
or
larger
pieces
of
aspen
that
were
piled
beneath
the
surface
could
it
be
that
the
aspen
which
i
had
marked
on
the
mountainside
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
so
short
a
time
before
and
which
i
had
followed
over
slope
and
slide
canal
and
basin
was
now
piled
on
the
bottom
of
this
pond
i
waded
out
into
the
water
prodded
about
with
a
pole
and
found
several
smaller
logs
dragging
one
of
these
to
the
surface
i
found
there
were
three
notches
on
it
evidently
these
heavy
green
tree
cuttings
had
been
sunk
to
the
bottom
simply
by
the
piling
of
other
similar
cuttings
upon
them
with
this
heavy
material
in
the
still
water
a
slight
contact
with
the
bottom
would
prevent
the
drifting
of
accumulating
cuttings
until
a
heavy
pile
could
be
formed
however
in
deep
or
swift
water
i
have
noticed
that
an
anchorage
for
the
first
few
pieces
was
secured
by
placing
these
upon
the
lower
slope
of
the
house
or
against
the
dam
scores
of
aspens
were
felled
in
the
grove
where
the
notched
ones
were
they
were
trimmed
cut
into
sections
and
limbs
logs
and
all
taken
over
the
route
of
the
one
i
had
followed
and
at
last
placed
in
a
pile
beside
the
big
house
this
harvest
gathering
went
on
for
a
month
all
about
was
busy
earnest
preparation
for
winter
the
squirrels
from
the
kept
a
rattling
rain
of
cones
on
the
forest
floor
the
cheery
chipmunk
foraged
and
frolicked
among
the
withered
leaves
and
plants
while
aspens
with
leaves
of
gold
fell
before
the
ivory
sickles
of
the
beaver
splendid
glimpses
grand
views
i
had
of
this
strange
how
busy
the
beavers
were
they
were
busy
in
the
grove
on
the
steep
mountainside
they
tugged
logs
along
the
runways
they
hurried
them
across
the
wrestled
with
them
in
canals
and
merrily
piled
them
by
the
rude
house
in
the
water
and
i
watched
them
through
the
changing
hours
i
saw
their
shadowy
activity
in
the
starry
silent
night
i
saw
them
hopefully
leave
home
for
the
harvest
groves
in
the
serene
twilight
and
i
watched
them
working
busily
in
the
light
of
the
noonday
sun
most
of
the
aspens
were
cut
off
between
thirteen
and
fifteen
inches
above
the
ground
a
few
stumps
were
less
than
five
inches
high
while
a
number
were
four
feet
high
these
high
cuttings
were
probably
made
from
reclining
trunks
of
lodged
aspens
which
were
afterward
removed
the
average
diameter
of
the
aspens
cut
was
four
and
one
half
inches
at
the
top
of
the
stump
numerous
seedlings
of
an
inch
diameter
were
cut
and
the
largest
tree
felled
for
this
harvest
measured
fourteen
inches
across
the
stump
this
had
been
laid
low
only
a
few
hours
before
i
found
it
and
a
bushel
of
white
chips
and
cuttings
encircled
the
lifeless
stump
like
a
wreath
in
falling
the
top
had
become
entangled
in
an
alder
thicket
and
lodged
six
feet
from
the
ground
it
remained
in
this
position
for
several
days
and
was
apparently
abandoned
but
the
last
time
i
went
to
see
it
the
alders
which
upheld
it
were
being
cut
away
although
the
alders
were
thick
upon
the
ground
only
those
which
had
upheld
the
aspen
had
been
cut
it
may
be
that
the
beaver
which
felled
them
looked
and
thought
before
they
went
ahead
with
the
cutting
why
had
this
and
several
other
large
aspens
been
left
uncut
in
a
place
where
all
were
convenient
for
harvest
all
other
neighboring
aspens
were
cut
years
ago
one
explanation
is
that
the
beaver
realized
that
the
tops
of
the
aspens
were
entangled
and
interlocked
in
the
limbs
of
crowding
spruces
and
would
not
fall
if
cut
off
at
the
bottom
this
and
one
other
were
the
only
large
ones
that
were
felled
and
the
tops
of
these
had
been
recently
released
by
the
overturning
of
some
spruces
and
the
breaking
of
several
branches
on
others
other
scattered
large
aspens
were
left
uncut
but
all
of
these
were
clasped
in
the
arms
of
spruces
it
was
the
habit
of
these
colonists
to
transfer
a
tree
to
the
harvest
pile
promptly
after
cutting
it
down
but
one
morning
i
found
logs
on
slides
and
in
canals
and
unfinished
work
in
the
grove
as
though
everything
had
been
suddenly
dropped
in
the
night
when
work
was
at
its
height
coyotes
had
howled
freely
during
the
night
but
this
was
not
uncommon
in
going
over
the
grounds
i
found
the
explanation
of
this
untidy
work
in
a
bear
track
and
numerous
wolf
tracks
freshly
moulded
in
the
muddy
places
after
the
bulk
of
the
harvest
was
gathered
i
went
one
day
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
moraine
and
briefly
observed
the
methods
of
the
island
beaver
colony
the
ways
of
the
two
colonies
were
in
some
things
very
different
in
the
spruce
tree
colony
the
custom
was
to
move
the
felled
aspen
promptly
to
the
harvest
pile
in
the
island
colony
the
custom
was
to
cut
down
most
of
the
harvest
before
transporting
any
of
it
to
the
pile
beside
the
house
of
the
one
hundred
and
trees
that
had
been
felled
for
this
harvest
one
hundred
and
were
still
lying
where
they
fell
however
the
work
of
transporting
was
getting
under
way
a
few
logs
were
in
the
pile
beside
the
house
and
numerous
others
were
scattered
along
the
canals
runways
and
slides
between
the
house
and
the
harvest
grove
there
was
more
wasted
labor
too
in
the
island
colony
this
was
noticeable
in
the
attempts
that
had
been
made
to
fell
trees
that
could
not
fall
one
aspen
had
three
times
been
cut
off
at
the
bottom
the
third
cut
was
more
than
three
feet
from
the
ground
and
was
made
by
a
beaver
working
from
the
top
of
a
fallen
log
still
this
aspen
refused
to
come
down
and
there
it
hung
like
a
collapsed
balloon
entangled
in
before
the
white
man
came
it
is
probable
that
beaver
did
most
of
their
work
in
the
but
at
present
except
in
the
most
remote
localities
day
work
is
perilous
prowling
hunters
have
compelled
most
beaver
to
work
at
night
the
spruce
tree
colony
was
an
isolated
one
and
occasionally
its
members
worked
and
even
played
in
the
sunshine
each
day
i
secluded
myself
kept
still
and
waited
and
on
a
few
occasions
watched
them
as
they
worked
in
the
light
one
windy
day
just
as
i
was
unroping
myself
from
the
shaking
limb
of
a
spruce
four
beaver
were
plodding
along
in
single
file
beneath
they
had
come
out
of
a
hole
between
the
roots
of
the
spruce
at
an
aspen
growth
about
fifty
feet
distant
they
separated
though
they
had
been
closely
assembled
each
appeared
utterly
oblivious
of
the
presence
of
the
others
one
squatted
on
the
ground
by
an
aspen
took
a
bite
of
bark
out
of
it
and
ate
leisurely
by
and
by
he
rose
clasped
the
aspen
with
fore
paws
and
began
to
bite
chips
from
it
systematically
he
was
deliberately
cutting
it
down
the
most
aged
beaver
waddled
near
an
aspen
gazed
into
its
top
for
a
few
seconds
then
moved
away
about
ten
feet
and
started
to
fell
a
aspen
the
one
rejected
was
entangled
at
the
top
presently
the
third
beaver
selected
a
tree
and
after
some
trouble
to
get
comfortably
seated
or
squatted
also
began
cutting
the
fourth
beaver
disappeared
and
i
did
not
see
him
again
while
i
was
looking
for
this
one
the
huge
aged
beaver
whose
venerable
appearance
had
impressed
me
the
first
evening
appeared
on
the
scene
he
came
out
of
a
hole
beneath
some
spruces
about
a
hundred
feet
distant
he
looked
neither
to
right
nor
to
left
nor
up
nor
down
as
he
ambled
toward
the
aspen
growth
when
about
halfway
there
he
wheeled
suddenly
and
took
an
uneasy
survey
of
the
open
he
had
traversed
as
though
he
had
heard
an
enemy
behind
then
with
apparently
stolid
indifference
he
went
on
leisurely
and
for
a
time
paused
among
the
cutters
which
did
nothing
to
indicate
that
they
realized
his
presence
he
ate
some
bark
from
a
green
limb
on
the
ground
moved
on
and
went
into
the
hole
beneath
me
he
appeared
so
large
that
i
afterward
measured
the
distance
between
the
two
aspens
where
he
paused
he
was
not
less
than
three
and
a
half
feet
long
and
probably
weighed
fifty
pounds
he
had
all
his
toes
there
was
no
white
spot
on
his
body
in
fact
there
was
neither
mark
nor
blemish
by
which
i
could
positively
identify
him
yet
i
feel
that
in
my
month
around
the
colony
i
beheld
the
patriarch
of
the
first
evening
in
several
scenes
of
action
illustration
aspens
cut
by
beaver
minutes
after
the
second
beaver
began
cutting
he
made
a
brief
pause
then
he
suddenly
thudded
the
ground
with
his
tail
hurriedly
took
out
a
few
more
chips
and
ran
away
with
the
other
two
beaver
a
little
in
advance
just
as
his
aspen
settled
over
and
then
fell
all
paused
for
a
time
close
to
the
hole
beneath
me
and
then
the
old
beaver
returned
to
his
work
the
one
that
had
felled
his
tree
followed
closely
and
at
once
began
on
another
aspen
the
other
beaver
with
his
aspen
half
cut
off
went
into
the
hole
and
did
not
again
come
out
by
and
by
an
old
and
a
young
beaver
came
out
of
the
hole
the
young
one
at
once
began
cutting
limbs
off
the
recently
felled
aspen
while
the
other
began
work
on
the
tree
but
he
ignored
the
work
already
done
and
finally
severed
the
trunk
about
four
inches
above
the
cut
made
by
the
other
suddenly
the
old
beaver
whacked
the
ground
and
ran
but
at
thirty
feet
distant
he
paused
and
nervously
thumped
the
ground
with
his
tail
as
his
aspen
slowly
settled
and
fell
then
he
went
into
the
hole
beneath
me
this
year
harvest
was
so
much
larger
than
usual
that
it
may
be
the
population
of
this
colony
had
been
increased
by
the
arrival
of
emigrants
from
a
persecuted
colony
down
in
the
valley
the
total
harvest
numbered
four
hundred
and
trees
these
made
a
harvest
pile
four
feet
high
and
ninety
feet
in
circumference
a
thick
covering
of
willows
was
placed
on
top
of
the
harvest
pile
i
can
not
tell
for
what
reason
unless
it
was
to
sink
all
the
aspen
below
reach
of
the
ice
this
bulk
of
stores
together
with
numerous
roots
of
willow
and
water
plants
which
in
the
water
are
eaten
from
the
bottom
of
the
pond
would
support
a
numerous
beaver
population
through
the
days
of
ice
and
snow
on
the
last
tour
through
the
colony
everything
was
ready
for
the
long
and
cold
winter
dams
were
in
repair
and
ponds
were
brimming
over
with
water
the
fresh
coats
of
mud
on
the
houses
were
freezing
to
defy
enemies
and
a
bountiful
harvest
was
home
is
full
of
hope
and
romance
what
a
joy
it
must
be
to
every
man
or
animal
who
has
a
hand
in
it
what
a
satisfaction
too
for
all
dependent
upon
a
harvest
to
know
that
there
is
abundance
stored
for
all
the
frosty
days
the
people
of
this
wild
strange
picturesque
colony
had
planned
and
prepared
well
i
wished
them
a
winter
unvisited
by
cruel
fate
or
foe
and
trusted
that
when
june
came
again
the
fat
and
furry
young
beaver
would
play
with
the
aged
one
amid
the
tiger
lilies
in
the
shadows
of
the
big
spruce
trees
weather
weather
the
narrow
alpine
zone
of
peaks
and
snow
that
forms
the
crest
of
the
rocky
mountains
has
its
own
individual
elemental
moods
its
characteristic
winds
its
electrical
and
other
peculiarities
and
a
climate
of
its
own
commonly
its
days
are
serene
and
sunny
but
from
time
to
time
it
has
hail
and
snow
and
showers
of
rain
cold
as
it
is
subject
to
violent
changes
from
clear
calm
air
to
blizzard
i
have
enjoyed
these
strange
silent
heights
in
every
season
of
the
year
in
climbing
scores
of
these
peaks
in
crossing
the
passes
often
on
snowshoes
and
in
camping
here
and
there
on
the
skyline
i
have
encountered
these
climatic
changes
and
had
numerous
strange
experiences
from
these
experiences
i
realize
that
the
transcontinental
aviator
with
this
realm
of
peak
and
sky
will
have
some
delightful
as
well
as
serious
surprises
he
will
encounter
stern
conditions
he
may
like
a
bird
be
carried
from
his
course
by
treacherous
currents
and
battle
with
breakers
or
struggle
in
vain
in
the
monstrous
invisible
maelstroms
that
beset
this
ocean
of
air
of
these
skyline
factors
the
more
imposing
are
wind
cold
clouds
rain
snow
and
subtle
capricious
electricity
high
winds
are
common
across
the
summits
of
these
mountains
and
they
are
most
prevalent
in
winter
those
of
summer
though
less
frequent
and
much
more
are
a
menace
on
account
of
their
fury
and
the
suddenness
with
which
they
surprise
and
sweep
the
heights
early
one
summer
while
exploring
a
wide
alpine
moorland
above
the
i
and
some
others
had
an
experience
with
one
of
those
sudden
stormbursts
the
region
was
utterly
wild
but
up
to
it
straggling
tourists
occasionally
rode
for
a
view
of
the
surrounding
mountain
world
all
alone
i
was
studying
the
ways
of
the
wild
inhabitants
of
the
heights
i
had
spent
the
calm
sunny
morning
in
watching
a
solitary
bighorn
that
was
feeding
among
some
boulders
he
was
aged
and
he
ate
as
though
his
teeth
were
poor
and
walked
as
though
afflicted
with
rheumatism
suddenly
this
patriarch
forgot
his
age
and
fled
precipitately
with
almost
the
speed
of
frightened
youth
i
leaped
upon
a
boulder
to
watch
him
but
was
instantly
knocked
headlong
by
a
wild
blast
of
wind
in
falling
i
caught
sight
of
a
straw
hat
and
a
wrecked
umbrella
falling
out
of
the
sky
rising
amid
the
pelting
gale
of
flung
hail
and
snow
i
pushed
my
way
in
the
teeth
of
the
storm
hoping
for
shelter
in
the
lee
of
a
about
a
hundred
yards
distant
a
lady
disheveled
hat
blew
by
me
and
with
the
howl
of
the
wind
came
almost
drowned
excited
human
utterances
nearing
the
i
caught
a
vague
view
of
a
of
man
and
horse
then
a
glimpse
of
the
last
gyration
in
which
an
elderly
eastern
gentleman
parted
company
with
a
stampeded
bronco
five
tourists
had
ridden
up
in
the
sunshine
to
enjoy
the
heights
and
the
suddenness
and
fierceness
of
the
storm
had
thrown
them
into
a
panic
and
stampeded
their
horses
they
were
drenched
and
severely
chilled
and
they
were
frightened
i
made
haste
to
tell
them
that
the
storm
would
be
brief
while
i
was
still
trying
to
reassure
them
the
clouds
commenced
to
dissolve
and
the
sun
came
out
presently
all
were
watching
the
majestic
soaring
of
two
eagles
up
in
the
blue
while
i
went
off
to
collect
five
scattered
that
were
contentedly
feeding
far
away
on
the
moor
though
the
winter
winds
are
of
slower
development
they
are
more
prolonged
and
are
tempestuously
powerful
occasionally
these
winds
blow
for
days
and
where
they
follow
a
fall
of
snow
they
blow
and
whirl
this
about
so
wildly
that
the
air
is
befogged
for
several
hundred
feet
above
the
earth
so
violently
and
thickly
is
the
powdered
snow
flung
about
that
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
is
the
longest
that
one
can
see
or
breathe
in
it
these
high
winter
winds
come
out
of
the
west
in
a
deep
broad
stratum
that
is
far
above
most
of
the
surface
over
which
they
blow
commonly
a
high
wind
strikes
the
western
slope
of
the
continental
divide
a
little
below
the
altitude
of
eleven
thousand
feet
this
striking
throws
it
into
fierce
confusion
it
rolls
whirling
up
the
steeps
and
frequently
shoots
far
above
the
highest
peaks
across
the
passes
it
sweeps
roars
down
the
cañons
on
the
eastern
slope
and
rushes
out
across
the
plains
though
the
western
slope
below
eleven
thousand
feet
is
a
calm
zone
the
entire
eastern
slope
is
being
whipped
and
scourged
by
a
flood
of
wind
occasionally
the
temperature
of
these
winds
is
warm
these
swift
insistent
winds
torn
intercepted
and
deflected
by
dashing
against
the
broken
skyline
produce
currents
sleepy
eddies
violent
vertical
whirls
and
milling
maelstroms
that
are
tilted
at
every
angle
in
places
there
is
a
gale
blowing
upward
and
here
and
there
the
air
pours
heavily
down
in
an
invisible
but
almost
crushing
one
winter
i
placed
an
in
granite
pass
at
twelve
thousand
feet
altitude
on
the
slope
of
long
peak
during
the
first
high
wind
i
fought
my
way
up
to
read
what
the
meter
said
both
the
meter
and
myself
found
the
wind
exceeded
the
speed
limit
emerging
above
the
trees
at
i
had
to
face
the
unbroken
fury
of
the
gale
as
it
swept
down
the
slope
from
the
heights
above
the
region
was
barren
of
snow
the
wind
dashed
me
with
sandblasts
and
pelted
me
with
gravel
volleys
that
were
almost
unbearable
my
face
and
wrists
were
bruised
and
blood
was
drawn
in
many
places
where
the
gravel
struck
seeking
rest
and
shelter
from
this
persistent
punishment
i
approached
a
crag
and
when
only
a
few
yards
away
was
struck
and
overturned
by
the
milling
around
it
the
air
was
so
agitated
around
this
crag
that
its
churnings
followed
me
like
disturbed
water
under
and
behind
the
large
where
shelter
was
hoped
for
but
only
partly
secured
illustration
trees
at
on
the
last
slope
below
the
meter
the
wind
simply
played
with
me
i
was
overthrown
tripped
knocked
down
blown
explosively
off
my
feet
and
dropped
sometimes
the
wind
dropped
me
heavily
but
just
as
often
it
eased
me
down
i
made
no
attempt
to
stand
erect
most
of
the
time
this
was
impossible
and
at
all
times
it
was
very
dangerous
now
and
then
the
wind
rolled
me
as
i
lay
resting
upon
a
smooth
place
advancing
was
akin
to
swimming
a
whirlpool
or
to
wrestling
one
way
up
a
slope
despite
the
ceaseless
opposition
of
a
vigorous
tireless
opponent
at
last
i
crawled
and
climbed
up
to
the
buzzing
cups
of
the
meter
so
swiftly
were
they
rotating
they
formed
a
blurred
circle
like
a
the
meter
showed
that
the
wind
was
passing
with
a
speed
of
from
one
hundred
and
to
one
hundred
and
seventy
miles
an
hour
the
meter
blew
up
or
rather
flew
to
pieces
during
a
swifter
spurt
the
wind
so
loudly
ripped
and
roared
round
the
top
of
the
peak
that
i
determined
to
scale
the
summit
and
experience
its
wildest
and
most
eloquent
efforts
all
my
strength
and
climbing
knowledge
were
required
to
prevent
my
being
literally
blown
out
of
converging
rock
channels
through
which
the
wind
gushed
again
and
again
i
clung
with
all
my
might
to
avoid
being
torn
from
the
ledges
fortunately
not
a
bruise
was
received
though
many
times
this
was
narrowly
avoided
the
top
of
the
peak
an
area
of
between
three
and
four
acres
and
comparatively
level
was
in
an
easy
eddy
almost
a
calm
when
compared
with
the
wind
activities
below
and
near
by
apparently
the
collided
so
forcefully
with
the
western
wall
of
the
peak
that
it
was
thrown
far
above
the
summit
before
recovering
to
continue
its
way
eastward
but
against
the
resisting
spurs
and
pinnacles
a
little
below
the
wind
roared
boomed
and
crashed
in
its
determined
passionate
onsweep
the
better
to
hear
this
grand
uproar
i
advanced
to
the
western
edge
of
the
summit
here
my
hat
was
torn
off
but
not
quite
grasped
by
the
upshooting
blast
it
fell
into
the
swirl
above
the
summit
and
in
large
circles
floated
upward
at
slow
speed
rising
directly
above
the
top
of
the
peak
it
rose
and
circled
so
slowly
that
i
threw
several
stones
at
it
trying
to
knock
it
down
before
it
rose
out
of
range
the
diameter
of
the
circle
through
which
it
floated
was
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
when
it
had
risen
five
or
perhaps
six
hundred
feet
above
the
summit
it
suddenly
tumbled
over
and
over
as
though
about
to
fall
but
instead
of
falling
it
sailed
off
toward
the
east
as
though
a
carrier
pigeon
hurrying
for
a
known
and
definite
place
in
the
horizon
some
of
the
whirlpools
rough
channels
and
dangerous
tides
in
the
sea
of
air
either
are
in
fixed
places
or
adjust
themselves
to
winds
from
a
different
quarter
so
definitely
that
their
location
can
be
told
by
considering
them
in
connection
with
the
direction
of
the
wind
thus
the
sea
of
air
may
be
partly
charted
and
the
position
of
some
of
its
dangerous
places
even
in
oceans
positively
known
however
there
are
dangerous
winds
of
one
kind
or
more
properly
numerous
local
that
are
sometimes
created
within
these
high
winds
that
do
not
appear
to
have
any
habits
it
would
be
easier
to
tell
where
the
next
thunderbolt
would
fall
than
where
the
next
one
of
these
would
explode
one
of
these
might
be
called
a
cannon
wind
an
old
prospector
who
had
experienced
countless
high
winds
among
the
crags
once
stated
that
high
gusty
winds
on
sometimes
shoot
off
a
cannon
these
explosive
blasts
touch
only
a
short
narrow
space
but
in
this
they
are
almost
irresistible
isolated
clouds
often
soften
and
beautify
the
stern
heights
as
they
silently
float
and
drift
among
peaks
and
passes
flocks
of
these
sky
birds
frequently
float
about
together
on
sunny
days
in
addition
to
giving
a
charm
to
the
peaks
their
restless
shadows
never
tire
of
readjusting
themselves
and
are
ever
trying
to
find
a
foundation
or
a
place
of
rest
upon
the
tempestuous
topography
of
the
heights
below
now
and
then
a
deep
dense
will
cover
the
crests
and
envelop
the
summit
slopes
for
days
these
vapory
strata
usually
feel
but
little
wind
and
they
vary
in
thickness
from
a
few
hundred
to
a
few
thousand
feet
sometimes
one
of
these
rests
so
serenely
that
it
suggests
an
aggregation
of
clouds
pushed
off
to
one
side
because
temporarily
the
sky
does
not
need
them
elsewhere
for
either
decorative
or
precipitative
purposes
now
and
then
they
do
drop
rain
or
snow
but
most
of
the
time
they
appear
to
be
in
a
procrastinating
mood
and
unable
to
decide
whether
to
precipitate
or
to
move
on
commonly
the
upper
surfaces
of
appear
like
a
peaceful
sea
they
appear
woolly
and
sometimes
fluffy
level
and
often
so
vast
that
they
sweep
away
beyond
the
horizon
peaks
and
ridges
often
pierce
their
interminable
surface
with
romantic
continents
and
islands
along
their
romantic
shores
above
the
surface
of
the
picturesque
sea
the
airship
could
sail
in
safe
poetic
flight
though
the
foggy
depths
below
were
too
dense
for
any
traveler
to
penetrate
one
spring
the
snow
fell
continuously
around
my
cabin
for
three
days
reports
told
that
the
storm
was
general
over
the
rocky
mountain
region
later
investigations
showed
that
that
cloud
and
storm
were
spread
over
a
quarter
of
a
million
square
miles
over
this
entire
area
there
was
made
a
comparatively
even
deposit
of
thirty
inches
of
snow
all
over
the
area
the
bottom
or
under
surface
of
the
cloud
was
at
an
altitude
of
approximately
nine
thousand
feet
my
cabin
with
an
altitude
of
nine
thousand
was
immersed
in
cloud
though
at
times
it
was
one
hundred
feet
or
so
below
it
fully
satisfied
of
the
widespread
and
general
nature
of
the
storm
and
convinced
of
the
comparatively
level
line
of
the
bottom
surface
of
the
cloud
i
determined
to
measure
its
vertical
depth
and
observe
its
slow
movements
by
climbing
above
its
silver
lining
this
was
the
third
day
of
the
storm
on
snowshoes
up
the
mountainside
i
went
through
this
almost
opaque
cloud
it
was
not
bitterly
cold
but
cloud
and
snow
combined
were
blinding
and
only
a
ravine
and
instinct
enabled
me
to
make
my
way
at
an
altitude
of
about
twelve
thousand
feet
the
depth
of
the
snow
became
suddenly
less
soon
falling
to
only
an
inch
or
so
within
a
few
rods
of
where
it
began
to
grow
shallow
i
burst
through
the
upper
surface
of
the
cloud
around
me
and
above
there
was
not
a
flake
of
snow
over
the
entire
of
a
quarter
of
a
million
square
miles
all
heights
above
twelve
thousand
had
escaped
both
cloud
and
snow
the
cloud
which
thus
lay
between
the
altitudes
of
nine
thousand
and
twelve
thousand
feet
was
three
thousand
feet
deep
when
i
rose
above
the
surface
of
this
sea
the
sun
was
shining
upon
it
it
was
a
smooth
sea
not
a
breath
of
wind
ruffled
it
the
top
of
long
peak
rose
bald
and
broken
above
climbing
to
the
top
of
a
commanding
ridge
i
long
watched
this
beautiful
expanse
of
cloud
and
could
scarcely
realize
that
it
was
steadily
flinging
multitudes
of
snowflakes
upon
slopes
and
snows
below
though
practically
stationary
this
cloud
expanse
had
some
slight
movements
these
were
somewhat
akin
to
those
of
a
huge
raft
that
is
becalmed
in
a
quiet
harbor
slowly
easily
and
almost
imperceptibly
the
entire
mass
slid
forward
along
the
mountains
it
moved
but
a
short
distance
paused
for
some
minutes
then
slowly
slid
back
a
trifle
farther
than
it
had
advanced
after
a
brief
stop
the
entire
mass
as
though
anchored
in
the
centre
started
to
swing
in
an
easy
deliberate
rotation
after
a
few
degrees
of
movement
it
paused
hesitated
then
swung
with
slow
heavy
movement
back
in
addition
to
these
shifting
horizontal
motions
there
was
a
short
vertical
one
the
entire
mass
slowly
sank
and
settled
two
or
three
hundred
feet
then
with
scarcely
a
pause
rose
easily
to
the
level
from
which
it
sank
only
once
did
it
rise
above
this
level
during
all
seasons
of
the
year
there
are
periods
when
the
mountains
sit
in
sunshine
and
all
the
winds
are
still
in
days
of
this
kind
the
transcontinental
passengers
in
airships
would
have
a
view
of
sublime
scenes
the
purple
forests
the
embowered
peaceful
parks
the
drifted
snows
the
streams
that
fold
and
shine
through
the
forests
all
these
combine
and
cover
magnificently
the
billowed
and
broken
distances
while
ever
floating
up
from
below
are
the
soft
ebbing
and
intermittent
songs
from
white
water
that
leaps
in
glory
though
the
summits
of
the
rocky
mountains
are
always
cool
it
is
only
in
rare
brief
times
that
they
fall
within
the
frigid
spell
of
farthest
north
and
become
cruelly
cold
the
climate
among
these
is
much
milder
than
people
far
away
imagine
the
electrical
effects
that
enliven
and
sometimes
illuminate
these
summits
are
peculiar
and
often
highly
interesting
thunderbolts
are
rare
far
less
frequent
than
in
most
lowland
districts
however
when
lightning
does
strike
the
heights
it
appears
to
have
many
times
the
force
that
is
displayed
in
lowland
strokes
my
conclusions
concerning
the
infrequency
of
thunderbolts
on
these
peaks
are
drawn
chiefly
from
my
own
experience
i
have
stood
through
storms
upon
more
than
a
score
of
rocky
mountain
summits
that
were
upward
of
fourteen
thousand
feet
above
the
tides
only
one
of
these
peaks
was
struck
this
was
peak
which
rises
to
the
height
of
feet
above
the
sea
seventy
storms
i
have
experienced
on
the
summit
of
this
peak
and
during
these
it
was
struck
but
three
times
to
my
knowledge
one
of
these
strokes
fell
a
thousand
feet
below
the
top
two
struck
the
same
spot
on
the
edge
of
the
summit
the
rock
struck
was
granite
and
the
effects
of
the
strokes
were
similar
hundreds
of
pounds
of
shattered
rock
fragments
were
flung
horizontally
afar
out
of
scores
of
experiences
in
passes
i
have
record
of
but
two
thunderbolts
both
of
these
were
heavy
in
all
these
instances
the
thunderbolt
descended
at
a
time
when
the
was
a
few
hundred
feet
above
the
place
struck
during
the
greater
number
of
storms
the
cloud
is
in
contact
with
the
surface
or
but
little
removed
from
it
never
have
i
known
the
lightning
to
strike
when
the
clouds
were
close
to
the
surface
or
touching
it
it
is
however
common
during
times
of
clouds
for
the
surface
air
to
be
heavily
charged
with
electrical
fluid
this
often
is
accompanied
with
strange
effects
prominent
among
these
is
a
low
pulsating
hum
or
an
intermittent
with
now
and
then
a
sharp
sometimes
accompanying
at
other
times
only
briefly
breaking
in
are
subdued
cracklings
and
roarings
falling
snowflakes
during
these
times
are
occasionally
briefly
luminous
like
fireflies
the
instant
they
touch
the
earth
is
the
commonest
effect
that
people
experience
in
these
sizzling
electrical
storms
there
is
a
straightening
of
the
hairs
and
apparently
a
sharp
pull
upon
each
as
john
muir
has
it
you
are
sure
to
be
lost
in
wonder
and
praise
and
every
hair
of
your
head
will
stand
up
and
hum
and
sing
like
an
enthusiastic
congregation
most
people
take
very
gravely
their
first
experience
of
this
kind
especially
when
accompanied
as
it
often
is
with
apparent
and
a
purplish
roll
or
halo
around
the
head
during
these
times
a
sudden
finger
movement
will
produce
a
crackling
snap
or
spark
on
rare
occasions
these
interesting
peculiarities
become
irritating
and
sometimes
serious
to
one
in
a
watcher
on
the
heights
in
wild
life
on
the
rockies
i
have
described
a
case
of
this
kind
a
few
people
suffer
from
a
muscular
cramp
or
spasm
and
occasionally
the
muscles
are
so
tensed
that
breathing
becomes
difficult
and
disturbed
i
have
never
known
an
electrical
storm
to
be
fatal
relief
from
the
effects
of
such
a
storm
may
generally
be
had
by
lying
between
big
stones
or
beneath
shelving
rocks
on
one
occasion
i
saw
two
ladies
and
four
gentlemen
lay
dignity
aside
and
obtain
relief
by
jamming
into
a
place
barely
large
enough
for
two
in
my
own
case
activity
invariably
intensified
these
effects
and
the
touching
of
steel
or
iron
often
had
the
same
results
for
some
years
a
family
resided
upon
the
slope
of
mt
teller
at
an
altitude
of
twelve
thousand
feet
commonly
during
storms
the
stove
and
pipe
were
charged
with
fluid
so
heavily
that
it
was
a
case
of
hands
off
and
let
dinner
wait
and
sometimes
spoil
until
the
heavens
shut
off
the
current
the
sustaining
buoyancy
of
the
air
to
aerial
things
decreases
with
altitude
in
this
light
air
some
motor
machinery
is
less
efficient
than
it
is
in
the
lowlands
it
is
probable
that
aviators
will
always
find
the
air
around
uplifted
peaks
much
less
serviceable
than
this
element
upon
the
surface
of
the
sea
but
known
and
unknown
dangers
in
the
air
will
be
mastered
and
ere
long
the
dangers
to
those
who
take
flight
through
the
air
will
be
no
greater
than
the
dangers
to
those
who
go
down
to
the
sea
in
ships
flying
across
the
crest
of
the
continent
above
the
crags
and
cañons
will
be
enchanting
and
this
journey
through
the
upper
air
may
bring
to
many
the
first
stirring
message
from
the
rocks
and
templed
hills
rob
of
the
rockies
rob
of
the
rockies
hurrying
out
of
the
mountains
in
northern
colorado
in
may
i
came
upon
a
shaggy
black
and
white
dog
hopelessly
fastened
in
an
entanglement
of
fence
that
had
been
caught
in
a
clump
of
willows
he
had
been
carried
down
with
the
flood
and
was
coated
with
earth
masses
of
mud
clung
here
and
there
to
his
matted
hair
and
his
handsome
tail
was
encased
as
though
in
a
plaster
cast
he
was
bruised
and
the
barbs
had
given
him
several
cuts
one
ear
was
slit
and
a
from
a
cut
on
his
head
almost
closed
his
left
eye
had
i
not
chanced
upon
him
he
probably
would
have
perished
from
hunger
and
slow
torture
though
he
must
have
spent
twelve
hours
in
this
miserable
barbed
binding
he
made
no
outcry
the
barbs
repeatedly
penetrated
his
skin
as
i
untangled
and
uncoiled
the
wires
from
around
his
neck
and
between
his
legs
as
he
neither
flinched
nor
howled
i
did
him
the
injustice
to
suppose
that
he
was
almost
dead
he
trusted
me
and
as
i
rolled
him
about
taking
off
that
last
thorny
tangle
the
slit
ear
bloody
muzzle
and
muddy
head
could
not
hide
from
me
an
expression
of
gratitude
in
his
intelligent
face
returning
from
a
and
narrowly
escaping
drowning
too
i
was
a
dirty
vagabond
myself
when
the
last
wire
dropped
from
the
prisoner
he
enthusiastically
began
to
share
his
earth
coating
with
me
he
leaped
up
and
half
clasped
me
in
his
fore
legs
at
the
same
time
wiping
most
of
the
mud
off
his
head
on
one
side
of
my
face
then
he
darted
between
my
legs
racing
about
and
occasionally
leaping
or
flinging
himself
against
me
each
time
he
leaped
he
twisted
as
he
came
up
so
that
he
struck
me
with
his
back
head
or
side
and
thus
managed
to
transfer
much
of
this
fertile
coat
to
me
he
finally
ended
by
giving
several
barks
and
then
racing
to
the
river
for
a
drink
and
a
bath
i
too
needed
another
cloudburst
just
what
kinds
of
dogs
may
have
made
his
mixed
ancestry
could
not
be
told
occasionally
i
had
a
glimpse
of
a
collie
in
him
but
for
all
practical
purposes
he
was
a
shepherd
and
he
frequently
exhibited
traits
for
which
the
shepherd
is
celebrated
i
could
never
find
out
where
he
came
from
it
may
be
that
the
flood
separated
him
from
his
master
team
he
may
have
been
washed
away
from
one
of
the
flooded
ranches
or
he
may
have
been
as
the
later
told
me
a
tramp
dog
that
has
been
seen
in
north
park
cheyenne
and
greeley
home
he
may
have
left
master
he
may
have
lost
or
tramp
he
may
have
been
but
he
insisted
on
going
with
me
and
after
a
kindly
though
forceful
protest
i
gave
in
and
told
him
he
might
follow
the
flood
had
swept
all
bridges
away
and
i
was
hurrying
down
the
poudre
hoping
to
find
a
place
to
cross
without
being
compelled
to
swim
he
followed
and
kept
close
to
my
heels
as
i
wound
in
and
out
among
flood
débris
and
but
i
did
not
find
a
place
that
appeared
shallow
as
it
was
necessary
to
cross
i
patted
my
companion
thinking
he
would
not
care
to
go
farther
and
waded
in
he
squatted
by
the
water
edge
and
set
up
a
howl
i
stopped
and
explained
to
him
that
this
was
very
bad
crossing
for
an
injured
dog
and
that
we
would
better
separate
but
he
only
howled
the
more
he
wanted
to
go
with
me
but
was
afraid
to
try
alone
returning
to
the
bank
i
found
a
rope
in
the
flood
wreckage
tied
this
around
his
neck
and
waded
in
he
followed
cheerfully
but
swam
with
effort
when
about
half
way
across
and
in
the
water
up
to
my
shoulders
i
attached
myself
to
a
floating
log
lest
the
dog
should
weaken
and
need
help
within
sixty
or
seventy
feet
of
the
desired
bank
we
struck
a
stretch
of
swift
deep
water
in
which
i
was
compelled
to
let
the
animal
go
and
swim
for
the
shore
my
companion
was
swept
down
by
the
current
and
the
rope
caught
on
a
snag
entangling
my
legs
so
that
i
had
to
cut
it
or
drown
the
current
swept
poor
doggie
against
some
stranded
wreckage
in
midstream
on
this
he
climbed
while
i
struggled
on
to
the
bank
i
called
to
him
to
come
on
but
he
only
howled
again
i
called
patted
my
knees
made
friendly
gesticulations
and
did
all
i
could
think
of
to
encourage
him
finally
i
told
him
that
if
he
would
only
start
i
would
come
part
way
and
be
ready
to
help
him
if
he
got
into
trouble
but
he
would
not
start
not
desiring
the
task
of
returning
for
him
through
the
cold
strong
current
and
feeling
in
a
hurry
i
started
on
he
howled
and
then
cried
so
piteously
that
i
went
back
and
towed
him
safely
ashore
that
night
some
good
people
of
the
ranch
house
treated
both
of
us
kindly
and
in
the
morning
they
wanted
to
keep
my
companion
i
was
willing
that
he
should
stay
for
he
would
have
a
good
place
and
i
was
bound
for
denver
where
i
feared
some
accident
would
befall
him
but
he
growled
and
ran
away
when
the
man
advanced
to
tie
him
i
started
on
afoot
and
he
joined
me
insisting
on
following
all
the
time
he
had
been
with
me
his
only
thought
appeared
to
be
to
stay
with
me
game
dogs
horses
and
people
he
saw
and
passed
with
expressionless
face
except
two
or
three
times
when
he
imagined
i
was
in
danger
then
he
was
instantly
alert
for
my
defense
when
the
stage
overtook
us
and
stopped
to
let
me
in
he
leaped
in
also
and
squatted
by
the
driver
with
such
an
air
of
importance
that
i
half
expected
to
see
him
take
the
lines
and
drive
i
lost
him
in
my
rush
to
make
the
train
at
the
station
he
could
of
course
have
kept
with
me
had
he
been
without
fear
or
if
he
had
really
so
desired
as
the
train
pulled
out
i
saw
him
start
with
an
air
of
unconscious
confidence
that
told
of
wide
experience
he
was
a
tramp
dog
the
next
time
i
saw
him
was
several
months
later
in
leadville
some
two
hundred
miles
from
where
he
left
me
where
in
the
mean
time
he
may
have
rambled
what
towns
he
may
have
visited
or
what
good
days
or
troubles
he
may
have
had
i
have
no
means
of
knowing
i
came
walking
into
leadville
with
snowshoes
under
my
arm
from
two
weeks
snowshoeing
and
camping
on
the
upper
slopes
of
the
rockies
the
ends
of
broken
tree
limbs
had
torn
numerous
triangles
in
my
clothes
my
soft
hat
was
unduly
slouchy
and
fourteen
intimate
association
with
a
along
with
only
an
infrequent
indifferent
contact
with
water
had
made
me
a
sight
to
behold
for
dogs
anyway
on
the
outskirts
one
snarly
cur
noticed
me
and
barked
in
a
few
minutes
at
least
a
dozen
dogs
were
closely
following
and
making
me
unwelcome
to
their
haunts
they
grew
bold
with
time
numbers
and
closer
inspection
of
me
they
crowded
unpleasantly
close
realizing
that
if
one
of
them
became
courageous
enough
to
make
a
snap
at
my
legs
all
might
follow
his
example
i
began
to
sidle
out
of
the
middle
of
the
street
intending
to
leap
a
fence
close
by
and
take
refuge
in
a
house
before
i
could
realize
it
they
were
snapping
right
and
left
at
me
and
howling
as
they
collided
with
the
tail
of
a
snowshoe
which
i
used
as
a
bayonet
we
were
close
to
the
fence
i
trying
to
find
time
to
turn
and
leap
over
but
i
was
too
busy
and
without
assistance
it
is
probable
that
i
should
have
been
badly
bitten
suddenly
there
was
something
like
a
football
at
my
feet
then
followed
a
yelping
of
curs
with
tucked
tails
dashing
right
and
left
to
avoid
the
ferocious
tackles
of
a
shaggy
black
and
white
dog
it
was
rob
who
was
delighted
to
see
me
and
whom
i
assured
that
he
was
most
welcome
he
had
been
seen
about
leadville
for
two
or
three
months
and
several
persons
had
bits
of
information
concerning
him
all
agreed
that
he
had
held
aloof
from
other
dogs
and
that
he
quietly
ignored
the
friendly
greetings
of
all
who
made
advances
he
was
not
quarrelsome
but
had
nearly
killed
a
bulldog
that
had
attacked
a
boy
on
one
occasion
a
braying
burro
so
irritated
him
that
he
made
a
savage
attack
on
the
beast
and
sent
him
down
the
street
braying
in
a
most
excited
manner
the
drivers
of
ore
wagons
reported
that
he
occasionally
followed
them
to
and
from
the
mines
up
the
mountainside
at
one
he
was
a
frequent
caller
and
usually
came
in
to
have
a
drink
but
no
one
knew
where
he
ate
or
slept
one
day
a
little
mittened
girl
had
left
her
sled
to
play
with
him
he
had
responded
in
a
most
friendly
manner
and
had
raced
jumped
circled
and
barked
at
last
he
had
carried
her
slowly
proudly
on
his
back
i
grew
greatly
interested
in
his
biography
and
wondered
what
could
have
shaped
his
life
so
strangely
in
what
kind
of
a
home
was
his
pretty
puppyhood
spent
why
was
he
so
indifferent
to
dogs
and
people
and
had
he
left
or
lost
a
master
early
next
spring
after
vainly
trying
to
follow
the
trail
of
explorer
pike
i
struck
out
on
a
road
that
led
me
across
the
wet
mountain
valley
up
into
sangre
de
cristo
mountains
when
well
up
into
the
mountains
i
saw
a
large
dog
walking
slowly
toward
me
and
at
once
recognized
him
as
rob
although
clean
and
he
held
his
head
low
and
walked
as
though
discouraged
the
instant
he
scented
me
however
he
leaped
forward
and
greeted
me
with
many
a
wag
bark
and
leap
he
was
one
hundred
miles
from
leadville
and
fully
three
hundred
miles
from
the
flood
scene
on
the
poudre
he
faced
about
and
followed
me
up
into
the
alpine
heights
far
beyond
trail
we
saw
a
number
of
deer
and
many
mountain
sheep
these
he
barely
noticed
but
a
bear
that
we
came
upon
he
was
most
eager
to
fight
the
second
night
in
the
mountains
near
horne
peak
we
had
an
exciting
time
with
a
mountain
lion
coyotes
howled
during
the
evening
much
to
the
dog
annoyance
it
was
a
cold
night
and
being
without
bedding
i
had
moved
the
fire
and
lain
down
upon
the
warm
earth
the
fire
was
at
my
feet
a
crag
rose
above
my
head
and
rob
was
curled
up
against
my
back
a
shrill
uncanny
cry
of
the
lion
roused
me
after
less
than
an
hour
sleep
the
dog
was
frightened
and
cuddled
up
close
to
my
face
the
lion
was
on
a
low
terrace
in
the
crag
not
many
yards
distant
having
been
much
in
the
wilds
alone
and
never
having
been
attacked
by
lions
i
had
no
fear
of
them
but
none
had
ever
been
so
audacious
as
this
one
i
began
to
think
that
perhaps
it
might
be
true
that
a
lion
would
leap
upon
a
dog
boldly
at
night
even
though
the
dog
lay
at
the
feet
of
his
master
i
kept
close
watch
threw
stones
at
suspicious
shadows
on
the
cliff
terraces
and
maintained
a
blazing
fire
long
before
sunrise
we
started
down
the
mountain
both
rob
and
i
were
hungry
and
although
we
startled
birds
and
rabbits
rob
paid
not
the
least
attention
to
them
at
noon
on
madano
pass
i
lay
down
for
a
sleep
and
used
rob
for
a
pillow
this
he
evidently
enjoyed
for
he
lay
still
with
head
stretched
out
and
one
eye
open
at
we
met
a
who
was
carrying
a
club
i
had
seen
this
man
elsewhere
and
on
recognizing
me
as
he
came
up
he
waved
his
club
by
the
way
of
expressing
gladness
rob
misinterpreted
this
demonstration
and
dragged
me
almost
to
the
frightened
herder
before
i
could
make
him
understand
that
this
ragged
unwashed
fellow
had
no
ill
wishes
for
me
i
had
in
mind
to
climb
sierra
blanca
the
following
day
and
hoped
to
spend
the
night
in
a
ranch
house
on
the
northern
slope
of
this
great
peak
toward
sundown
rob
and
i
climbed
through
a
pole
fence
and
entered
the
ranch
round
a
corner
of
the
house
came
a
boy
racing
on
a
willow
switch
pony
on
seeing
us
he
stopped
relaxed
his
hold
on
the
willow
and
started
for
rob
how
happily
he
ran
holding
out
both
eager
hands
the
dog
sprang
playfully
backward
and
began
to
dodge
and
bark
as
the
boy
laughingly
and
repeatedly
fell
while
trying
to
catch
him
just
as
i
entered
the
house
rob
was
trying
to
climb
to
the
top
of
the
fence
after
his
new
playmate
that
night
rob
was
agreeable
with
every
one
in
the
house
and
even
had
a
romp
with
the
cat
these
people
wanted
to
keep
him
and
offered
money
and
their
best
i
knew
that
with
them
he
would
have
kind
treatment
to
the
day
of
his
death
i
wanted
him
too
but
i
knew
the
weeks
of
just
before
me
would
be
too
hard
for
him
rob
is
a
free
dog
i
said
and
is
of
his
own
choice
simply
traveling
with
me
as
a
companion
i
can
not
sell
or
give
him
away
i
like
him
but
if
he
wants
to
stay
it
will
be
a
pleasure
to
me
to
leave
him
the
next
morning
every
one
was
wondering
whether
rob
would
go
or
stay
the
dog
had
made
up
his
mind
he
watched
me
prepare
to
leave
with
keenest
interest
but
it
was
evident
that
he
had
planned
to
stay
and
his
boy
friend
was
very
happy
as
i
passed
through
the
yard
these
two
were
playing
together
at
the
gate
i
called
at
which
rob
paused
gave
a
few
happy
barks
and
then
raced
away
to
try
to
follow
his
mountain
boy
to
the
top
of
the
old
pole
fence
sierra
blanca
sierra
blanca
i
was
rambling
alone
on
snowshoes
doing
some
winter
observations
in
the
alpine
heights
of
the
sangre
de
cristo
range
it
was
miles
to
the
nearest
house
there
was
but
little
snow
upon
the
mountains
and
for
winter
the
day
was
warm
i
was
thirsty
and
a
spring
which
burst
forth
among
the
fragments
of
petrified
wood
was
more
inviting
than
the
in
my
pocket
the
water
was
cool
and
clear
tasteless
and
to
all
appearances
pure
as
i
rose
from
drinking
a
deadly
feeling
overcame
me
after
a
few
seconds
of
this
a
violent
and
prolonged
nausea
came
on
evidently
i
had
discovered
a
mineral
spring
perhaps
it
was
arsenic
perhaps
some
other
poison
poison
of
some
kind
it
must
have
been
and
poisonous
mineral
springs
are
not
unknown
the
sickness
was
very
like
seasickness
with
a
severe
internal
pain
and
a
mental
stimulus
added
after
a
few
minutes
i
partly
recovered
from
these
effects
and
set
off
sadly
for
the
nearest
house
of
which
i
had
heard
this
was
eight
or
ten
miles
distant
and
i
hoped
to
find
it
through
the
guidance
of
a
crude
map
which
a
prospector
had
prepared
for
me
i
had
not
before
explored
this
mountainous
section
the
gulches
and
ridges
which
descended
the
slope
at
right
angles
to
my
course
gave
me
a
rough
sea
which
kept
me
stirred
up
i
advanced
in
tottering
installments
a
slow
short
advance
would
be
made
on
wobbly
legs
then
a
as
pay
for
the
advance
gained
now
and
then
there
was
smoothness
and
i
took
an
occasional
look
at
severe
sierra
blanca
now
looming
big
before
me
it
was
mostly
bare
and
brown
with
a
number
of
icy
plates
and
ornaments
shining
in
the
sun
at
last
in
the
evening
light
from
the
top
of
a
gigantic
moraine
i
looked
down
upon
the
river
and
a
log
nestling
in
a
grassy
open
bordered
with
clumps
of
spruces
an
old
lady
and
gentleman
with
real
sympathy
in
their
faces
stood
in
the
doorway
and
for
a
moment
watched
me
then
hastened
to
help
me
from
the
pole
fence
to
the
door
illustration
sierra
blanca
in
winter
while
giving
them
an
incoherent
account
of
my
experience
i
fell
into
a
stupor
and
although
i
had
evidently
much
to
say
concerning
drinking
and
apparently
showed
symptoms
of
too
much
drink
these
old
people
did
not
think
me
drunk
waking
from
a
fantastic
dream
i
heard
does
he
need
any
more
sage
tea
the
western
pioneers
have
faith
in
sage
tea
and
many
ascribe
to
it
all
the
qualities
usually
claimed
for
patent
medicines
the
following
morning
i
was
able
to
walk
about
while
my
slightly
bloated
bronzed
face
did
not
appear
so
badly
altogether
i
looked
much
better
than
i
felt
these
good
old
people
declared
that
they
had
not
seen
better
days
but
that
they
were
living
the
simple
life
from
choice
they
loved
the
peace
of
this
isolated
mountain
home
and
the
companionship
of
the
grand
old
peak
in
the
central
states
the
wife
had
been
a
professor
in
a
state
school
while
the
husband
had
been
a
state
attorney
the
nearest
neighbor
was
four
miles
downstream
and
no
one
lived
farther
up
the
mountain
the
nearest
railroad
station
was
seventy
rough
miles
away
it
appeared
best
to
hasten
to
denver
but
two
days
in
a
jarring
wagon
to
reach
the
railroad
seemed
more
than
i
could
endure
i
had
not
planned
even
to
try
for
the
top
of
colorado
highest
peak
in
midwinter
but
the
way
across
sierra
blanca
was
shorter
and
probably
much
easier
than
the
way
around
across
the
range
directly
over
the
shoulder
of
sierra
blanca
lay
historic
fort
garland
it
was
only
thirty
miles
away
and
i
determined
to
cross
the
range
and
reach
it
in
time
for
the
midnight
train
on
hearing
this
resolution
the
old
people
were
at
first
astonished
but
after
a
moment
they
felt
that
they
at
last
knew
who
i
was
you
must
be
the
snow
man
surely
no
one
but
he
would
try
to
do
this
in
winter
they
with
scores
of
other
had
heard
numerous
and
wild
accounts
of
my
lone
unarmed
and
winter
adventures
in
the
mountain
snows
the
misgivings
of
the
old
gentleman
concerning
the
wisdom
of
my
move
grew
stronger
when
he
perceived
how
weak
i
was
as
we
proceeded
on
up
the
slope
of
sierra
blanca
the
ice
blocked
us
at
and
in
his
parting
handclasp
i
felt
the
hope
and
fear
of
a
father
who
sees
his
son
go
away
into
the
world
he
appeared
to
realize
that
i
was
not
only
weak
but
that
at
any
moment
i
might
collapse
he
knew
the
heights
were
steep
and
stern
and
that
in
the
miles
to
fort
garland
there
was
neither
house
nor
human
being
to
help
me
apparently
he
hoped
that
at
the
last
moment
i
would
change
my
mind
and
turn
back
up
the
northern
side
of
the
peak
i
made
my
way
now
and
then
it
was
necessary
to
cut
a
few
steps
in
the
steeps
the
shoulder
of
the
peak
across
which
i
was
to
go
was
thirteen
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
and
in
making
the
last
climb
to
this
it
was
necessary
to
choose
between
a
precipitous
slope
and
an
extremely
steep
more
correctly
a
rock
glacier
i
picked
my
way
up
this
with
the
greatest
caution
to
start
a
rock
avalanche
would
be
easy
for
the
loose
rocks
lay
insecure
on
a
slope
of
perilous
steepness
from
time
to
time
in
resting
i
heard
the
entire
mass
settling
snarling
and
grinding
its
way
with
glacier
slowness
down
the
steep
just
beneath
the
shoulder
the
tilting
steepness
of
this
rocky
débris
showed
all
too
well
that
the
slightest
provocation
would
set
a
grinding
whirlpool
of
a
stone
river
madly
flowing
the
expected
at
last
happened
when
a
boulder
upon
which
i
lightly
leaped
settled
and
then
gave
way
the
rocks
before
made
haste
to
get
out
of
the
way
while
those
behind
began
readjusting
themselves
the
liveliest
of
kept
me
on
top
of
the
now
settling
hesitating
and
boulder
there
was
nothing
substantial
upon
which
to
leap
slowly
the
heavy
boulder
settled
forward
with
a
roll
now
right
now
left
with
me
on
top
trying
to
avoid
being
tumbled
into
the
grinding
mill
hopper
below
at
last
on
the
left
a
sliding
mass
of
crushed
macadamized
rock
offered
a
possible
means
of
escape
not
daring
to
risk
thrusting
a
leg
into
this
uncertain
mass
i
allowed
myself
to
fall
easily
backwards
until
my
body
was
almost
horizontal
and
then
face
upwards
i
threw
myself
off
the
boulder
with
all
my
strength
the
rock
gave
a
great
plunge
and
went
bounding
down
the
slope
sending
the
smaller
stuff
flying
before
at
each
contact
with
the
earth
though
completely
relaxed
and
with
the
snowshoes
on
my
back
acting
as
a
buffer
the
landing
was
something
of
a
jolt
for
a
few
seconds
i
lay
limp
and
spread
out
and
drifted
slowly
along
with
the
mass
of
macadam
when
this
came
to
rest
i
rose
up
and
with
the
greatest
concern
for
my
foundation
made
my
way
upwards
and
at
last
lay
down
to
breathe
and
rest
upon
the
solid
granite
shoulder
of
sierra
blanca
in
ten
hours
the
midnight
train
would
be
due
in
fort
garland
and
as
the
way
was
all
downgrade
i
hoped
that
my
strength
would
hold
out
till
i
caught
it
but
turning
my
eyes
from
the
descent
to
the
summit
i
forgot
the
world
below
and
also
my
body
suddenly
i
felt
and
knew
only
the
charm
and
the
call
of
the
summit
there
are
times
when
nature
completely
commands
her
citizens
a
splendid
landscape
sunset
clouds
or
a
rainbow
on
a
slope
by
these
one
may
be
as
completely
charmed
and
made
as
completely
captive
as
were
those
who
heard
the
music
of
orpheus
lyre
my
youthful
dream
had
been
to
scale
peak
after
peak
and
from
the
earthly
spires
to
see
the
scenic
world
far
below
and
far
away
all
this
had
come
true
though
of
many
trips
into
the
sky
and
cloudland
none
had
been
up
to
the
bold
heights
of
blanca
thinking
that
the
poisoned
water
might
take
me
from
the
list
of
those
who
seek
good
tidings
in
the
heights
i
suddenly
determined
to
reach
those
wintry
while
yet
i
had
the
strength
i
rose
from
relaxation
laid
down
my
snowshoes
and
started
for
the
summit
blanca
is
a
mountain
with
an
enormous
amount
of
material
in
it
enough
for
a
score
of
sizable
peaks
its
battered
head
is
nearly
two
thousand
feet
above
its
rugged
shoulder
the
sun
sank
slowly
as
i
moved
along
a
rocky
skyline
ridge
and
at
last
gained
the
summit
beyond
an
infinite
ocean
of
low
broken
peaks
sank
the
sun
it
was
a
wonderful
sunset
effect
in
that
plain
the
san
luis
valley
peaks
rose
from
the
plain
one
side
glowing
in
burning
gold
the
other
bannered
with
black
shadows
the
low
ragged
clouds
dragged
slanting
shadows
across
the
golden
pale
a
million
slender
silver
threads
were
flung
out
in
a
measureless
horizontal
fan
from
the
sun
the
sunset
from
the
summit
of
sierra
blanca
was
the
grandest
that
i
have
ever
seen
the
prismatic
brilliancy
played
on
peak
and
cloud
then
changed
into
purple
fading
into
misty
gray
while
the
light
of
this
strong
mountain
day
slowly
vanished
in
the
infinite
silence
of
a
perfect
mountain
night
then
came
the
serious
business
of
getting
down
and
off
the
rough
slope
and
out
of
the
inky
woods
before
darkness
took
complete
possession
after
intense
vigilance
and
effort
for
two
hours
i
emerged
from
the
slope
and
started
across
the
easy
sloping
plain
beneath
a
million
stars
the
night
was
mild
and
still
slowly
across
the
wide
brown
way
i
made
my
course
guided
by
a
low
star
that
hung
above
fort
garland
my
strength
ran
low
and
in
order
to
sustain
it
i
moved
slowly
lying
down
and
relaxing
every
few
minutes
my
mind
was
clear
and
strangely
active
with
pleasure
i
recalled
in
order
the
experiences
of
the
day
and
the
wonderful
sunset
with
which
it
came
triumphantly
to
a
close
as
i
followed
a
straight
line
across
the
plains
i
could
not
help
wondering
whether
the
denver
physicians
would
tell
me
that
going
up
to
see
the
sunset
was
a
serious
blunder
or
a
triumph
however
the
possibility
of
dying
was
a
thought
that
never
came
at
eleven
when
instinctively
and
positively
i
felt
that
i
had
traveled
far
enough
i
paused
but
from
fort
garland
neither
sound
nor
light
came
to
greet
me
in
the
silent
mysterious
night
i
might
pass
close
to
the
low
dull
adobes
of
this
station
without
realizing
its
presence
so
confident
was
i
that
i
had
gone
far
enough
that
i
commenced
a
series
of
constantly
enlarging
semicircles
trying
to
locate
in
the
darkness
the
hidden
fort
in
the
midst
of
these
a
coyote
challenged
and
a
dog
answered
i
hastened
toward
the
dog
and
came
upon
a
single
low
adobe
full
of
mexicans
who
could
not
understand
me
however
their
soft
accents
awakened
vivid
memories
in
my
mind
and
distinctly
my
strangely
stimulated
brain
took
me
back
through
fifteen
years
to
the
seedling
orange
groves
in
the
land
of
where
i
had
lingered
and
learned
to
speak
their
tongue
an
offer
of
five
dollars
for
transportation
to
fort
garland
in
time
for
the
midnight
train
sent
mexicans
flying
in
all
directions
as
though
i
had
hurled
a
bomb
two
boys
with
an
ancient
wobbling
horse
and
buckboard
landed
me
at
the
platform
as
the
of
my
train
swept
across
it
the
big
conductor
greeted
me
with
here
the
snow
man
again
worse
starved
than
ever
the
wealth
of
the
woods
the
wealth
of
the
woods
the
ancients
told
many
wonderful
legends
concerning
the
tree
and
claimed
for
it
numerous
extraordinary
qualities
modern
experience
is
finding
some
of
these
legends
to
be
almost
literal
truth
and
increasing
knowledge
of
the
tree
shows
that
it
has
many
of
those
high
qualities
for
which
it
was
anciently
revered
though
people
no
longer
think
of
it
as
the
tree
of
life
they
are
beginning
to
realize
that
the
tree
is
what
enables
our
race
to
make
a
living
and
to
live
comfortably
and
hopefully
upon
this
beautiful
world
camping
among
forests
quickly
gives
one
a
home
feeling
for
them
and
develops
an
appreciation
of
their
value
how
different
american
history
might
have
been
had
columbus
discovered
a
treeless
land
the
american
forests
have
largely
contributed
to
the
development
of
the
country
the
first
settlers
on
the
atlantic
coast
felled
and
used
the
waiting
trees
for
they
also
used
wood
for
fuel
furniture
and
fortifications
when
were
established
in
the
wilderness
the
axe
was
as
essential
as
the
gun
from
atlantic
to
pacific
the
pioneers
built
their
cabins
of
wood
as
the

wood
continued
to
be
indispensable
it
was
used
in
almost
every
industry
and
it
has
a
more
general
use
than
ever
forests
enrich
us
in
many
ways
one
of
these
is
through
the
supply
of
wood
which
they
produce
which
they
annually
produce
wood
is
one
of
the
most
useful
materials
used
by
man
wood
is
the
material
it
gives
good
cheer
to
a
million
hearthstones
how
extensively
it
is
used
for
tools
furniture
and
vehicles
for
mine

and

the
living
influences
which

exert
the
environments
which
they
create

maintain
are
potent
to
enable

to

forests
are
and
everywhere
their
presence
tends
to
prevent
both
floods
and
extreme
low
water
they
check
evaporation
and
assist
drainage
they
create
soil
they
resist
sudden
changes
of
temperature
they
break
and
temper
the
winds
they
do
sanitary
work
by
taking
impurities
from
the
air
they
shelter
and
furnish
homes
for
millions
of
birds
which
destroy
enormous
numbers
of
and
injurious

lastly
and
possibly
most
important
forests
make

and
beautiful
next

they
are
the
most
useful
and
helpful
of
nature
agencies
forests
are
moderators
of
climate
they
heat
and
cool
slowly
their
slow
response
to
change
resists
sudden
changes
and
consequently
they
mitigate
the
rudeness
with
which
sudden
changes
are
always
accompanied
sudden
changes
of
temperature
are
often
annoying
and
enervating
to
man
and
frequently
do
severe
damage
to
domestic
plants
and
animals
they
sometimes
have
what
may
be
called
an
explosive
effect
upon
the
of
many
plants
and
animals
which
man
has
domesticated
and
is
producing
for
his
benefit
many
plants
have
been
domesticated
and
largely
so
specialized
that
they
have
been
rendered
less
hardy
with
good
care
these
plants
are
heavy
producers
but
to
have
from
them
a
premium
harvest
each
year
they
need
the
genial
clime
the
stimulating
shelter
and
the
constant
protection
which
only
forests
can
supply
closely
allied
to
changes
of
temperature
is
the
movement
of
the
air
in
the
sea
every
peninsula
is
a
breakwater
on
land
every
grove
is
a
windbreak
the
effect
of
the
violence
of
high
winds
on
fruited
orchards
and
fields
of
golden
grain
may
be
compared
to
the
beatings
of
innumerable
clubs
hot
waves
and
cold
waves
come
like
withering
breaths
of
flame
and
frost
to
trees
and
plants
high
winds
may
be
mastered
by
the
forest
the
forest
will
make
even
the
storm
king
calm
and
it
will
also
soften
temper
and
subdue
the
hottest
or
the
coldest
waves
that
blow
forests
may
be
placed
so
as
to
make
every
field
a
harbor
the
air
is
an
invisible
blotter
that
is
constantly
absorbing
moisture
its
capacity
to
evaporate
and
absorb
increases
with
rapidity
of
movement
roughly
six
times
as
much
water
is
evaporated
from
a
place
that
is
swept
by
a
wind
as
from
a
place
in
the
dead
calm
of
the
forest
the
quantity
of
water
evaporated
within
a
forest
or
in
its
shelter
is
many
times
less
than
is
evaporated
from
the
soil
in
an
exposed
situation
this
shelter
and
the
consequent
decreased
evaporation
may
save
a
crop
in
a
dry
season
during
seasons
of
scanty
rainfall
the
crops
often
fail
probably
not
because
sufficient
water
has
not
fallen
but
because
the
thirsty
winds
have
drawn
from
the
soil
so
much
moisture
that
the
in
the
soil
is
lowered
below
the
reach
of
the
roots
of
the
growing
plants
in
the
arid
west
the
winds
are
insatiable
in
many
localities
their
annual
capacity
to
absorb
water
is
greater
than
the
annual
precipitation
of
water
in
localities
the
central
idea
is
to
save
all
the
water
that
nature
supplies
to
prevent
the
moisture
from
evaporating
to
protect
it
from
the
robber
winds
forests
greatly
check
evaporation
and
professor
carpenter
the
celebrated
irrigation
engineer
says
that
forests
are
absolutely
necessary
for
the
interests
of
irrigated
agriculture
considering
the
many
influences
of
the
forest
that
are
beneficial
to
agriculture
it
would
seem
as
though
ideal
forest
environments
would
be
the
best
annual
assurance
that
the
crops
of
the
field
would
not
fail
and
that
the
soil
would
most
generously
respond
to
the
so
well
is
man
served
in
the
distribution
of
the
waters
and
the
management
of
their
movements
by
the
forests
that
forests
seem
almost
to
think
the
forest
is
an
eternal
mediator
between
winds
and
gravity
in
their
struggle
for
the
possession
of
the
waters
the
forest
seems
to
try
to
take
the
intermittent
and
rainfall
and
send
the
collected
waters
in
slow
and
steady
stream
back
to
the
sea
it
has
marked
success
and
one
may
say
it
is
only
to
the
extent
the
forest
succeeds
in
doing
this
that
the
waters
become
helpful
to
man
possibly
they
may
need
assistance
in
this
work
anyway
so
great
is
the
evaporation
on
the
mountains
of
the
west
that
john
muir
says
cut
down
the
groves
and
the
streams
will
vanish
many
investigators
assert
that
only
thirty
per
cent
of
the
rainfall
is
returned
by
the
rivers
to
the
sea
evaporation
winds
probably
carry
away
the
greater
portion
of
the
remainder
afforestation
has
created
springs
and
streams
not
by
increasing
rainfall
although
the
forests
may
do
this
but
by
saving
the
water
that
falls
by
checking
evaporation
on
some
exposed
watersheds
the
winds
carry
off
as
much
as
ninety
per
cent
of
the
annual
precipitation
it
seems
plain
that
wider
better
forests
would
mean
deeper
steadier
streams
forests
not
only
check
evaporation
but
they
store
water
and
guard
it
from
the
greed
of
gravity
the
forest
gets
the
water
into
the
ground
where
a
brake
is
put
upon
the
pull
of
gravity
forest
floors
are
covered
with
fluffy
little
rugs
and
pierced
with
countless
so
is
the
porous
forest
floor
that
most
of
the
water
that
falls
in
the
forest
goes
into
the
ground
a
small
percentage
may
run
off
on
the
surface
but
the
greater
part
settles
into
the
earth
and
seeps
slowly
by
subterranean
drainage
till
at
last
it
bubbles
out
in
a
spring
some
distance
away
and
below
the
place
where
the
raindrops
came
to
earth
the
underground
drainage
upon
which
the
forest
insists
is
much
slower
and
steadier
than
the
surface
drainage
of
a
treeless
place
the
tendency
of
the
forest
is
to
take
the
water
of
the
widely
separated
rainy
days
and
dole
it
out
daily
to
the
streams
the
forest
may
be
described
as
a
large
reservoir
the
forest
is
so
large
a
reservoir
that
it
rarely
overflows
and
seepage
from
it
is
so
slow
that
it
seldom
goes
dry
the
presence
of
a
forest
on
a
watershed
tends
to
give
the
stream
which
rises
thereon
its
daily
supply
of
water
whether
it
rains
every
day
or
not
by
checking
evaporation
the
forest
swells
the
volume
of
water
in
this
stream
and
thereby
increases
its
and
makes
it
more
useful
as
a
deep
waterway
forests
so
regulate
that
if
all
the
watersheds
were
forested
but
few
floods
would
occur
has
allowed
many
a
flood
to
form
and
foam
and
to
ruin
a
thousand
homes
a
deforested
hillside
may
in
a
single
storm
loose
the
hoarded
soil
of
a
thousand
years
deforestation
may
result
in
filling
a
and
in
stopping
boats
a
thousand
miles
downstream
by
bringing
forests
to
our
aid
we
may
almost
domesticate
and
control
winds
and
waters
one
of
the
most
important
resources
is
soil
the
cream
of
the
earth
the
of
the
world
scientists
estimate
that
it
takes
nature
ten
thousand
years
to
create
a
foot
of
soil
this
heritage
of
ages
though
so
valuable
and
so
slowly
created
may
speedily
be
washed
away
and
lost
forests
help
to
anchor
it
and
to
hold
it
in
productive
places
every
tree
stands
upon
an
inverted
basket
of
roots
and
rootlets
rains
may
come
and
rains
may
go
but
these
roots
hold
the
soil
in
place
the
soil
of
hillsides
is
reinforced
and
anchored
with
a
webwork
of
the
roots
and
rootlets
of
the
forest
assisting
in
the
is
the
accumulation
of
twigs
and
leaves
the
litter
rugs
on
the
forest
floor
these
cover
the
soil
and
protect
it
from
both
wind
and
water
erosion
the
roots
and
rugs
not
only
hold
soil
but
add
to
the
soil
matter
by
catching
and
holding
the
trash
silt
dust
and
sediment
that
is
blown
or
washed
into
the
forest
the
forest
also
creates
new
soil
enriches
the
very
land
it
is
using
trash
on
a
forest
floor
absorbs
nitrogenous
matter
from
the
air
every
fallen
leaf
is
a
flake
of
a
fertilizer
roots
pry
rocks
apart
and
this
sets
up
chemical
action
acids
given
off
by
dissolve
even
the
rocks
and
turn
these
to
soil
a
tree
unlike
most
plants
creates
more
soil
than
it
consumes
in
a
forest
the
soil
is
steadily
growing
richer
and
deeper
birds
are
one
of
the
resources
of
the
country
they
are
the
protectors
the
winged
watchmen
of
the
products
which
man
needs
birds
are
hearty
eaters
and
the
food
which
they
devour
consists
mostly
of
noxious
and
injurious
insects
several
species
of
birds
feed
freely
upon
caterpillars
moths
and
other
deadly
most
species
of
birds
need
the
forest
for
shelter
a
home
and
a
and
having
the
forest
they
multiply
and
fly
out
into
the
fields
and
orchards
and
wage
a
more
persistent
warfare
even
than
the
farmer
upon
the
insistent
and
innumerable
weeds
and
also
the
swarms
of
insatiable
insects
birds
work
for
us
all
the
time
and
board
themselves
most
of
the
time
birds
are
of
inestimable
value
to
agriculture
but
many
of
these
useful
species
need
forest
shelter
so
to
lose
a
forest
means
at
the
same
time
to
lose
the
service
of
these
birds
the
forest
is
a
sanitary
agent
it
is
constantly
eliminating
impurities
from
the
earth
and
the
air
trees
check
sweep
and
filter
from
the
air
quantities
of
filthy
dust
their
leaves
absorb
the
poisonous
gases
from
the
air
roots
assist
in
drainage
and
absorb
impurities
from
the
soil
roots
also
give
off
acids
and
these
acids
together
with
the
acids
released
by
the
fallen
decaying
leaves
have
a
sterilizing
effect
upon
the
soil
trees
help
to
keep
the
earth
sweet
and
clean
and
water
which
comes
from
a
forested
watershed
is

to
be

at

may

of

what
the

said
of

the
speediest

by
which
a

death
without

are
two
words
that
may
be
written
upon
the
maps
of
most
depopulated
lands
and
declining
nations
when
one
who
is
acquainted
with
both
history
and
natural
history
reads
of
a
nation
that
its
forests
are
destroyed
he
naturally
pictures
the
train
of
evils
that
inevitably
follow
the
waste
and
failure
that
will
come
without
the
presence
of
forests
to
prevent
he
realizes
that
the
ultimate
condition
to
be
expected
in
this
land
is
a
waste
of
desolate
distances
arched
with
a
gray
sad
sky
beneath
which
a
few
lonely
ruins
stand
crumbling
and
pathetic
in
the
desert
drifting
sand
the
trees
are
our
friends
as
an
agency
for
promoting
and
sustaining
the
general
welfare
the
forest
stands
preëminent
a
nation
which
appreciates
trees
which
maintains
sufficient
forests
and
these
in
the
most
serviceable
places
may
expect
to
enjoy
regularly
the
richest
of
harvests
it
will
be
a
nation
of
homes
and
land
that
is
comfortable
full
of
hope
and
beautiful
the
forest
fire
the
forest
fire
forest
fires
led
me
to
abandon
the
most
nearly
ideal
journey
through
the
wilds
i
had
ever
embarked
upon
but
the
conflagrations
that
took
me
aside
filled
a
series
of
my
days
and
nights
with
wild
fiery
exhibitions
and
stirring
experiences
it
was
early
september
and
i
had
started
southward
along
the
crest
of
the
continental
divide
of
the
rocky
mountains
in
northern
colorado
all
autumn
was
to
be
mine
and
upon
this
alpine
skyline
i
was
to
saunter
southward
possibly
to
the
land
of
cactus
and
mirage
not
being
commanded
by
either
the
calendar
or
the
compass
no
day
was
to
be
marred
by
hurrying
i
was
just
to
linger
and
read
all
the
nature
stories
in
the
heights
that
i
could
comprehend
or
enjoy
from
my
twelve
thousand
feet
above
the
tides
miles
of
continental
slopes
could
be
seen
that
sent
their
streams
east
and
west
to
the
two
seas
with
many
a
loitering
advance
with
many
a
glad
going
back
intense
days
were
lived
after
two
great
weeks
i
climbed
off
the
treeless
heights
and
went
down
into
the
woods
to
watch
and
learn
the
deadly
and
dramatic
ways
of
forest
fires
this
revolution
in
plans
was
brought
about
by
the
view
from
amid
the
broken
granite
on
the
summit
of
long
peak
far
below
and
far
away
the
magnificent
mountain
distances
reposed
in
the
autumn
sunshine
the
dark
crags
snowy
summits
peaks
bright
lakes
purple
forests
traced
with
silver
streams
and
groves
of
aspen
all
fused
and
faded
away
in
the
golden
haze
but
these
splendid
scenes
were
being
blurred
and
blotted
out
by
the
smoke
of
a
dozen
or
more
forest
fires
illustration
a
forest
fire
on
the
grand
river
little
realizing
that
for
six
weeks
i
was
to
hesitate
on
heights
and
hurry
through
forests
i
took
a
good
look
at
the
destruction
from
afar
and
then
hastened
toward
the
nearest
this
was
a
blaze
on
the
range
that
was
storming
its
way
eastward
in
a
few
hours
it
would
travel
to
the
grand
river
which
flowed
southward
through
a
straight
valley
that
was
about
half
a
mile
wide
along
the
river
occupying
about
half
the
width
of
the
valley
was
a
picturesque
grassy
avenue
that
stretched
for
miles
between
ragged
there
was
but
little
wind
and
hoping
to
see
the
big
game
that
the
flames
might
drive
into
the
open
i
innocently
took
my
stand
in
the
centre
of
the
grassy
stretch
directly
before
the
fire
this
great
smoky
as
i
viewed
it
from
the
heights
while
i
was
descending
was
advancing
with
a
formidable
crooked
front
about
three
miles
across
the
left
wing
was
more
than
a
mile
in
advance
of
the
active
though
lagging
right
one
as
i
afterward
learned
the
difference
in
speed
of
the
two
wings
was
caused
chiefly
by
topography
the
forest
conditions
were
similar
but
the
left
wing
had
for
some
time
been
burning
up
a
slope
while
the
right
had
traveled
down
one
fire
burns
swiftly
up
a
slope
but
slowly
down
it
set
fire
simultaneously
to
the
top
and
the
bottom
of
a
forest
on
a
steep
slope
and
the
blaze
at
the
bottom
will
overrun
at
least
of
the
area
flame
and
the
drafts
that
it
creates
sweep
upward
upon
a
huge
lava
boulder
in
the
grassy
stretch
i
commanded
a
view
of
more
than
a
mile
of
the
and
was
close
to
where
a
game
trail
came
into
it
out
of
the
fiery
woods
on
this
burning
a
picturesque
unplanned
parade
passed
before
me
scattered
flakes
of
ashes
were
falling
when
a
herd
of
elk
led
the
exodus
of
wild
folk
from
the
forest
they
came
stringing
out
of
the
woods
into
the
open
with
both
old
and
young
going
forward
without
confusion
and
as
though
headed
for
a
definite
place
or
pasture
they
splashed
through
a
beaver
pond
without
stopping
and
continued
their
way
up
the
river
there
was
no
show
of
fear
no
suggestion
of
retreat
they
never
looked
back
deer
straggled
out
singly
and
in
groups
it
was
plain
that
all
were
fleeing
from
danger
all
were
excitedly
trying
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
something
and
they
did
not
appear
to
know
where
they
were
going
apparently
they
gave
more
troubled
attention
to
the
roaring
the
breath
and
the
movements
of
that
fiery
mysterious
monster
than
to
the
seeking
of
a
place
of
permanent
safety
in
the
grassy
open
into
which
the
smoke
was
beginning
to
drift
and
hang
the
deer
scattered
and
lingered
at
each
roar
of
the
fire
they
turned
hither
and
thither
excitedly
to
look
and
listen
a
flock
of
mountain
sheep
in
a
long
narrow
closely
pressed
rank
and
led
by
an
alert
aggressive
bighorn
presented
a
fine
appearance
as
it
raced
into
the
open
the
admirable
directness
of
these
wild
animals
put
them
out
of
the
category
occupied
by
tame
silly
sheep
without
slackening
pace
they
swept
across
the
grassy
valley
in
a
straight
line
and
vanished
in
the
wooded
slope
beyond
now
and
then
a
coyote
appeared
from
somewhere
and
stopped
for
a
time
in
the
open
among
the
deer
all
these
wise
little
wolves
were
a
trifle
nervous
but
each
had
himself
well
in
hand
glimpses
were
had
of
two
stealthy
mountain
lions
now
leaping
now
creeping
now
swiftly
fleeing
bears
were
the
most
fellows
in
the
exodus
each
loitered
in
the
grass
and
occasionally
looked
toward
the
oncoming
danger
their
actions
showed
curiosity
and
anger
but
not
alarm
each
duly
took
notice
of
the
surrounding
animals
and
one
old
grizzly
even
struck
viciously
at
a
snarling
coyote
two
black
bear
cubs
true
to
their
nature
had
a
merry
romp
even
these
serious
conditions
could
not
make
them
solemn
each
tried
to
prevent
the
other
from
climbing
a
tree
that
stood
alone
in
the
open
around
this
tree
they
clinched
cuffed
and
rolled
about
so
merrily
that
the
frightened
wild
folks
were
attracted
and
momentarily
forgot
their
fears
the
only
birds
seen
were
some
grouse
that
whirred
and
sailed
by
on
swift
definite
wings
they
were
going
somewhere
with
subdued
and
roar
the
fire
steadily
advanced
it
constantly
threw
off
an
upcurling
unbroken
cloud
of
heavy
smoke
that
hid
the
flames
from
view
now
and
then
a
whirl
of
wind
brought
a
shower
of
sparks
together
with
bits
of
burning
bark
out
over
the
open
valley
just
as
the
flames
were
reaching
the
margin
of
the
forest
a
great
bank
of
black
smoke
curled
forward
and
then
appeared
to
fall
into
the
grassy
open
i
had
just
a
glimpse
of
a
few
fleeing
animals
then
all
became
hot
fiery
and
dark
red
flames
darted
through
swirling
black
smoke
it
was
stifling
leaping
into
a
beaver
pond
i
lowered
my
own
sizzling
temperature
and
that
of
my
smoking
clothes
the
air
was
too
hot
and
black
for
breathing
so
i
fled
floundering
through
the
water
down
grand
river
a
quarter
of
a
mile
took
me
beyond
and
gave
me
fresh
air
here
the
smoke
ceased
to
settle
to
the
earth
but
extended
in
a
light
upcurling
stratum
a
few
yards
above
it
through
this
smoke
the
sunlight
came
so
changed
that
everything
around
was
magically
covered
with
a
canvas
of
sepia
or
rich
golden
brown
i
touched
the
burned
spots
on
hands
and
face
with
real
though
raw
balsam
and
then
plunged
into
the
district
to
explore
the
extensive
ruins
of
the
fire
a
prairie
fire
commonly
consumes
everything
to
the
and
leaves
behind
it
only
a
black
field
rarely
does
a
forest
fire
make
so
clean
a
sweep
generally
it
burns
away
the
smaller
limbs
and
the
foliage
leaving
the
tree
standing
all
blackened
and
bristling
this
fire
like
thousands
of
others
consumed
the
litter
carpet
on
the
forest
floor
and
the
mossy
covering
of
the
rocks
it
ate
the
underbrush
devoured
the
foliage
charred
and
burned
the
limbs
and
blackened
the
trunks
behind
was
a
dead
forest
in
a
desolate
field
a
territory
with
millions
of
bristling
mutilated
trees
a
forest
ruin
impressively
picturesque
and
pathetic
from
a
commanding
ridge
i
surveyed
this
ashen
desert
and
its
multitude
of
upright
figures
all
blurred
and
lifeless
these
stood
everywhere
in
the
gulches
on
the
slopes
on
the
ridges
against
the
sky
and
they
bristled
in
every
vanishing
distance
over
the
entire
area
only
a
few
trees
escaped
with
their
lives
these
were
isolated
in
soggy
glacier
meadows
or
among
rock
fields
and
probably
were
defended
by
friendly
when
the
fiery
billow
rolled
over
them
when
i
entered
the
burn
that
afternoon
the
fallen
trees
that
the
fire
had
found
were
in
ashes
the
trees
just
killed
were
smoking
while
the
standing
dead
trees
were
just
beginning
to
burn
freely
that
night
these
scattered
beacons
strangely
burned
among
the
multitudinous
dead
close
to
my
camp
all
through
that
night
several
of
these
fire
columns
showered
sparks
like
a
fountain
glowed
and
occasionally
lighted
up
the
scene
with
flaming
torches
weird
and
strange
in
the
night
were
the
groups
of
silhouetted
figures
in
a
between
me
and
the
flickering
heroic
torches
the
greater
part
of
the
area
burned
over
consisted
of
and
ridges
that
lay
between
the
altitudes
of
nine
thousand
and
eleven
thousand
feet
the
forest
was
made
up
almost
entirely
of
engelmann
and
douglas
spruces
alpine
fir
and
flexilis
pine
a
majority
of
these
trees
were
from
fifteen
to
inches
in
diameter
and
those
examined
were
two
hundred
and
fourteen
years
of
age
over
the
greater
extent
of
the
burn
the
trees
were
tall
and
crowded
about
two
thousand
to
the
acre
as
the
fire
swept
over
about
eighteen
thousand
acres
the
number
of
trees
that
perished
must
have
approximated
million
fires
make
the
rocky
mountains
still
more
rocky
this
bald
fact
stuck
out
all
through
this
burn
and
in
dozens
of
others
afterward
visited
most
rocky
mountain
fires
not
only
skin
off
the
humus
but
so
cut
up
the
fleshy
soil
and
so
completely
destroy
the
fibrous
bindings
that
the
elements
quickly
drag
much
of
it
from
the
bones
and
fling
it
down
into
the
down
many
summit
slopes
in
these
mountains
where
the
fires
went
to
the
snows
and
waters
still
scoot
and
scour
the
fire
damage
to
some
of
these
steep
slopes
can
not
be
repaired
for
generations
and
even
centuries
meantime
these
disfigured
places
will
support
only
a
scattered
growth
of
trees
and
sustain
only
a
sparse
population
of
animals
in
wandering
about
i
found
that
the
average
thickness
of
humus
decayed
vegetable
matter
consumed
by
this
fire
was
about
five
inches
the
removal
of
even
these
few
inches
of
covering
had
in
many
places
exposed
boulders
and
on
many
steeps
the
roots
were
consumed
and
the
productive
heritage
of
ages
was
left
to
be
the
early
victim
of
eager
running
water
and
insatiable
gravity
probably
the
part
of
this
burn
that
was
most
completely
devastated
was
a
tract
of
four
or
five
hundred
acres
in
a
zone
a
little
below
here
stood
a
heavy
forest
on
solid
rock
in
inches
of
humus
the
burned
with
the
humus
and
down
crashed
the
trees
into
the
flames
the
work
of
a
thousand
years
was
undone
in
a
day
the
loss
of
animal
life
in
this
fire
probably
was
not
heavy
in
five
or
six
days
of
exploring
i
came
upon
fewer
than
three
dozen
fire
victims
of
all
kinds
among
the
dead
were
groundhogs
bobcats
snowshoe
rabbits
and
a
few
grouse
flying
about
the
waste
were
crested
jays
gray
jays
camp
birds
and
magpies
coyotes
came
early
to
search
for
the
feast
prepared
by
the
fire
during
the
second
day
exploration
on
the
burn
a
grizzly
bear
and
i
came
upon
two
roasted
deer
in
the
end
of
a
gulch
i
was
first
to
arrive
so
grizzly
remained
at
what
may
have
been
a
respectful
distance
restlessly
watching
me
with
his
nearness
and
impolite
stare
i
found
it
very
embarrassing
to
eat
alone
however
two
days
of
fasting
had
prepared
me
for
this
primitive
feast
and
knowing
that
bears
were
better
than
their
reputation
i
kept
him
waiting
until
i
was
served
on
arising
to
go
i
said
come
you
may
have
the
remainder
there
is
plenty
of
it
the
fire
was
followed
by
clear
weather
and
for
days
the
light
ash
lay
deep
and
undisturbed
over
the
burn
one
morning
conditions
changed
and
after
a
few
preliminary
whirlwinds
a
gusty
gale
set
in
in
a
few
minutes
i
felt
and
appeared
as
though
just
from
an
the
ashen
was
blinding
and
choking
and
i
fled
for
the
unburned
heights
so
blinding
was
the
flying
ash
that
i
was
unable
to
see
and
to
make
matters
worse
the
trees
with
foundations
and
limbs
almost
severed
by
flames
commenced
falling
the
limbs
were
flung
about
in
a
perfectly
reckless
manner
while
the
falling
trees
took
a
fiendish
delight
in
crashing
down
alongside
me
at
the
very
moment
that
the
storm
was
most
blinding
being
without
nerves
and
incidentally
almost
choked
i
ignored
the
falling
bodies
and
kept
going
several
times
i
rushed
blindly
against
and
was
rudely
thrust
aside
and
finally
i
came
near
walking
off
into
space
from
the
edge
of
a
crag
after
this
i
sought
temporary
refuge
to
the
leeward
of
a
boulder
with
the
hope
that
the
weakened
trees
would
speedily
fall
and
end
the
danger
from
that
source
the
ash
flew
thicker
than
ever
did
desert
dust
it
was
impossible
to
see
and
so
nearly
impossible
to
breathe
that
i
was
quickly
driven
forth
i
have
been
in
many
dangers
but
this
is
the
only
instance
in
which
i
was
ever
irritated
by
nature
blind
forces
at
last
i
made
my
escape
from
them
from
clear
though
heights
i
long
watched
the
burned
area
surrender
its
slowly
accumulated
rich
store
of
to
the
insatiable
and
wind
by
morning
when
the
wind
abated
the
garnered
fertility
and
phosphates
of
generations
were
gone
and
the
sun
cast
the
shadows
of
millions
of
leafless
trees
upon
rock
bones
and
barren
earth
and
the
waters
were
still
to
take
their
toll
of
course
nature
would
at
once
commence
to
repair
and
would
again
upbuild
upon
the
foundations
left
by
the
fire
such
however
were
the
climatic
and
geological
conditions
that
improving
changes
would
come
but
slowly
in
a
century
only
a
good
beginning
could
be
made
for
years
the
greater
portion
of
the
burn
would
be
uninhabitable
by
bird
or
beast
those
driven
forth
by
this
fire
would
seek
home
and
food
in
the
neighboring
territory
where
this
influx
of
population
would
compel
interesting
readjustments
and
create
bitter
strife
between
the
old
population
and
the
new
this
fire
originated
from
a
which
a
had
left
burning
it
lived
three
weeks
and
extended
eastward
from
the
along
most
of
its
course
it
burned
to
the
on
the
left
while
rocky
ridges
glacier
meadows
and
rock
fields
stopped
its
extension
and
determined
the
side
line
on
the
right
it
ran
out
of
the
forest
and
stopped
in
the
grassy
grand
river
valley
across
its
course
were
a
number
of
rocky
ridges
and
grassy
gorges
where
the
fire
could
have
been
easily
stopped
by
removing
the
scattered
trees
by
burning
the
frail
bridges
that
enabled
the
fire
to
travel
from
one
dense
forest
to
abundant
fuel
beyond
in
a
city
it
is
common
to
smother
a
fire
with
water
or
acid
but
with
a
forest
fire
usually
it
is
best
to
break
its
inflammable
line
of
communication
by
removing
from
before
it
a
width
of
fibrous
material
the
axe
rake
hoe
and
shovel
are
the
usual
tools
a
few
yards
away
from
the
spot
where
the
fire
started
i
found
freshly
cut
in
the
bark
of
an
aspen
the
inscription
j
s
m
yale
a
bullet
had
obliterated
the
two
figures
for
days
i
wandered
over
the
mountains
going
from
fire
to
smoke
and
studying
burns
new
and
old
one
comparatively
level
tract
had
been
fireswept
in
on
this
the
soil
was
good
pine
had
promptly
restocked
the
burn
but
these
trees
were
now
being
smothered
out
by
a
promising
growth
of
engelmann
spruce
years
before
my
visit
a
fire
had
burned
over
about
four
thousand
acres
and
was
brought
to
a
stand
by
a
lake
a
rocky
ridge
and
a
wide
that
a
snowslide
had
cleared
through
the
woods
the
surface
of
the
burn
was
coarse
disintegrated
granite
and
sloped
toward
the
west
where
it
was
exposed
to
prevailing
high
westerly
winds
a
few
kinnikinnick
rugs
apparently
were
the
only
green
things
upon
the
surface
and
only
a
close
examination
revealed
a
few
stunted
trees
starting
it
was
almost
barren
erosion
was
still
active
there
were
no
roots
to
bind
the
finer
particles
together
or
to
anchor
them
in
place
one
of
the
most
striking
features
of
the
entire
burn
was
that
the
trees
killed
by
the
fire
years
ago
were
standing
where
they
died
they
had
excellent
in
the
shattered
surface
and
many
of
them
probably
would
remain
erect
for
years
the
fire
that
killed
them
had
been
a
hot
one
and
it
had
burned
away
most
of
the
limbs
and
had
so
thoroughly
boiled
the
pitch
through
the
exterior
of
the
trunk
that
the
wood
was
in
an
excellent
state
of
preservation
illustration
a
yellow
pine
years
after
it
had
been
killed
by
fire
another
old
burn
visited
was
a
small
one
in
an
engelmann
spruce
forest
on
a
moderate
northern
slope
it
had
been
stopped
while
burning
in
very
inflammable
timber
it
is
probable
that
on
this
occasion
either
a
rain
or
snow
had
saved
the
surrounding
forest
the
regrowth
had
slowly
extended
from
the
margin
of
the
forest
to
the
centre
of
the
burn
until
it
was
restocked
one
morning
i
noticed
two
small
fires
a
few
miles
down
the
mountain
and
went
to
examine
them
both
were
two
days
old
and
both
had
started
from
unextinguished
one
had
burned
over
about
an
acre
and
the
other
about
four
times
that
area
if
the
smaller
had
not
been
built
against
an
old
snag
it
probably
would
have
gone
out
within
a
few
hours
after
the
congressman
who
built
it
moved
camp
it
was
and
the
blaze
had
traveled
slowly
in
all
directions
and
burned
a
ragged
circle
that
was
about
sixty
feet
across
the
outline
of
the
other
blaze
was
that
of
a
flattened
ellipse
like
the
orbit
of
many
a
wandering
comet
in
the
sky
this
had
gone
before
the
wind
and
the
windward
end
of
its
orbit
closely
encircled
the
place
of
origin
the
nucleus
of
this
blaze
had
also
been
built
in
the
wrong
place
against
a
fallen
log
which
lay
in
a
deep
bed
of
decaying
needles
of
course
each
departing
camper
should
put
out
his
however
a
built
on
a
forest
floor
or
by
a
log
or
against
a
dead
tree
is
one
that
is
very
difficult
to
extinguish
with
the
best
of
intentions
one
may
deluge
such
a
fire
with
water
without
destroying
its
potency
a
fire
thus
secreted
appears
like
a
lie
to
have
a
spark
of
immortality
in
it
a
fire
should
not
be
built
in
contact
with
substances
that
will
burn
for
such
fuel
will
prolong
the
fire
life
and
may
lead
it
far
into
the
forest
there
is
but
little
danger
to
the
forest
from
a
fire
that
is
built
upon
rock
earth
sand
or
gravel
a
fire
so
built
is
isolated
and
it
usually
dies
an
early
natural
death
such
a
fire
one
built
in
a
safe
and
sane
place
is
easily
extinguished
the
larger
of
these
two
incipient
fires
was
burning
quietly
and
that
night
i
camped
within
its
orbit
toward
morning
the
wind
began
to
blow
this
surface
fire
began
to
leap
and
before
long
it
was
a
crown
fire
traveling
rapidly
among
the
it
swiftly
expanded
into
an
enormous
delta
of
flame
at
noon
i
looked
back
and
down
upon
it
from
a
and
it
had
advanced
about
three
miles
into
a
primeval
forest
sea
giving
off
more
smoke
than
a
volcano
i
went
a
day
journey
and
met
a
big
fire
that
was
coming
aggressively
forward
against
the
wind
it
was
burning
a
crowded
stunted
growth
of
forest
that
stood
in
a
deep
litter
carpet
the
smoke
which
flowed
freely
from
it
was
distinctly
ashen
green
this
expanded
and
maintained
in
the
sky
a
smoky
sheet
that
was
several
miles
in
length
before
the
fire
lay
a
square
mile
or
so
of
old
burn
which
was
covered
with
a
crowded
growth
of
pine
that
stood
in
a
deep
entanglement
of
fallen
timber
a
thousand
or
more
of
these
long
broken
dead
trees
covered
each
acre
with
wreckage
and
in
this
stood
upward
of
five
thousand
live
young
ones
this
would
make
an
intensely
hot
and
fire
it
appears
that
a
veteran
spruce
forest
had
occupied
this
burn
prior
to
the
fire
the
fire
had
occurred
years
before
trees
old
and
young
testified
to
the
date
in
the
margin
of
the
living
forest
on
the
edge
of
the
burn
were
numerous
trees
that
were
years
before
the
regrowth
on
the
burn
was
an
growth
that
night
as
the
fire
neared
the
young
tree
growth
i
scaled
a
rock
ledge
to
watch
it
before
me
and
between
the
fire
and
the
rocks
stood
several
veteran
pines
in
a
mass
of
timber
each
of
these
trees
had
an
outline
like
that
of
a
plump
lombardy
poplar
they
perished
in
the
most
spectacular
manner
blazing
bark
set
fire
to
the
fallen
timber
around
their
feet
this
fire
together
with
the
close
oncoming
so
heated
the
needles
on
the
that
they
gave
off
a
smoky
gas
this
was
issuing
from
every
top
when
a
rippling
rill
of
purplish
flame
ran
up
one
of
the
trunks
instantly
there
was
a
flash
and
white
flames
flared
upward
more
than
one
hundred
feet
stood
gushing
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
went
out
completely
the
other
trees
in
close
succession
followed
and
flashed
up
like
giant
geysers
discharging
flame
this
discharge
was
brief
but
it
was
followed
by
every
needle
on
the
trees
glowing
and
changing
to
white
incandescence
then
vanishing
in
a
minute
these
leafless
were
black
and
dead
the
struck
and
crossed
the
thicket
in
a
flash
each
tree
flared
up
like
a
fountain
of
gas
and
in
a
moment
a
deep
lake
of
flame
heaved
high
into
the
dark
indifferent
night
a
general
fire
of
the
timber
followed
and
the
smelter
heat
of
this
cut
the
green
trees
down
the
flames
widely
splendidly
illuminating
the
surrounding
mountains
and
changing
a
sky
to
convulsed
burning
lava
not
a
tree
was
left
standing
and
every
log
went
to
ashes
the
burn
was
as
completely
cleared
as
a
fireswept
prairie
in
places
there
were
holes
in
the
earth
where
had
burned
out
this
burn
was
an
ideal
place
for
another
growth
and
three
years
later
these
pines
were
growing
thereon
as
thick
as
wheat
in
a
field
in
a
boggy
area
within
the
burn
an
acre
or
two
of
aspen
sprang
up
this
area
however
was
much
smaller
than
the
one
that
the
fire
removed
from
the
bog
aspens
commonly
hold
territory
and
extend
their
holdings
by
sprouting
from
roots
but
over
the
greater
portion
of
the
bog
the
fire
had
either
baked
or
burned
the
roots
and
this
small
aspen
area
marked
the
wetter
part
of
the
bog
that
in
which
the
roots
had
survived
after
destroying
the
growth
the
fire
passed
on
and
the
following
day
it
burned
away
as
a
quiet
surface
fire
through
a
forest
of
scattered
trees
it
crept
slowly
forward
with
a
yellow
blaze
only
a
few
inches
high
here
and
there
this
reddened
over
a
pile
of
that
had
been
left
by
a
squirrel
or
blazed
up
in
a
pile
of
broken
limbs
or
a
fallen
it
consumed
the
litter
mulch
and
fertility
of
the
forest
floor
but
seriously
burned
only
a
few
trees
advancing
along
the
blaze
i
came
upon
a
veteran
yellow
pine
that
had
received
a
large
burn
in
its
instep
as
the
western
yellow
pine
is
the
best
in
the
conifer
family
it
was
puzzling
to
account
for
this
deep
burn
on
the
rocky
mountains
are
to
be
found
many
picturesque
yellow
pines
that
have
a
dozen
times
triumphed
over
the
greatest
enemy
of
the
forest
once
past
youth
these
trees
possess
a
thick
corky
bark
that
defies
the
average
fire
close
to
this
injured
old
fellow
was
a
rock
ledge
that
formed
an
influential
part
of
its
environment
its
sloping
surface
shed
water
and
fertility
upon
its
feet
cones
twigs
and
trash
had
also
slid
down
this
and
formed
an
inflammable
pile
which
in
burning
had
bored
into
its
ankle
an
examination
of
its
annual
rings
in
the
burned
hole
revealed
the
fact
that
it
too
had
been
slightly
burned
years
before
how
long
would
it
be
until
it
was
again
injured
by
fire
or
until
some
one
again
read
its
records
until
recently
a
forest
fire
continued
until
stopped
by
rain
or
snow
or
until
it
came
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
i
have
notes
on
a
forest
fire
that
lived
a
fluctuating
life
of
four
months
once
a
fire
invades
an
old
forest
it
is
impossible
speedily
to
get
rid
of
it
it
never
goes
out
declared
an
old
trapper
the
fire
will
crawl
into
a
log
burrow
down
into
a
root
or
eat
its
way
beneath
a
bed
of
needles
and
give
off
no
sign
of
its
presence
in
places
such
as
these
it
will
hibernate
for
weeks
despite
rain
or
snow
and
finally
some
day
come
forth
as
ferocious
as
ever
about
hours
after
the
blaze
a
came
to
extinguish
the
surface
fire
two
feet
of
snow
more
than
three
inches
of
water
fell
during
the
storm
i
was
comfortable
beneath
a
shelving
rock
with
a
fire
in
front
here
i
had
a
meal
of
wild
raspberries
and
and
reflected
concerning
the
uses
of
forests
and
wished
that
every
one
might
better
understand
and
feel
the
injustice
and
the
enormous
loss
caused
by
forest
fires
during
the
last
fifty
years
the
majority
of
the
western
forest
fires
have
been
set
by
unextinguished
while
the
majority
of
the
others
were
the
result
of
some
human
carelessness
the
number
of
preventable
forest
fires
is
but
little
less
than
the
total
number
true
lightning
does
occasionally
set
a
forest
on
fire
i
have
personal
knowledge
of
a
number
of
such
fires
but
i
have
never
known
lightning
to
set
fire
to
a
green
tree
remove
the
tall
dead
trees
from
forests
and
the
lightning
will
lose
the
greater
part
of
its
kindling
in
forest
protection
the
rivers
rocky
gulches
meadows
and
other
natural
boundary
lines
between
forests
are
beginning
to
be
used
and
can
be
more
fully
utilized
for
and
places
these
natural
may
be
connected
by
barren
cleared
lanes
through
the
forest
so
that
a
will
isolate
or
run
entirely
around
any
natural
division
of
forest
with
such
a
barrier
a
fire
could
be
kept
within
a
given
section
or
shut
out
of
it
in
order
to
fight
fire
in
a
forest
it
must
be
made
accessible
by
means
of
roads
and
trails
these
should
run
on
or
alongside
the
so
as
to
facilitate
the
movements
of
fire
patrols
or
there
should
be
with
every
forest
an
organized
force
of
men
who
are
eternally
vigilant
to
prevent
or
to
fight
forest
fires
fires
should
be
fought
while
young
and
small
before
they
are
beyond
control
there
should
be
on
commanding
crags
and
in
each
of
these
should
be
a
lookout
to
watch
constantly
for
starting
fires
or
suspicious
smoke
in
the
surrounding
sea
of
forest
the
lookout
should
have
telephonic
connection
with
rangers
down
the
slopes
in
our
national
forests
incidents
like
the
following
are
beginning
to
occur
upon
a
summit
is
stationed
a
ranger
who
has
two
hundred
thousand
acres
of
forest
to
patrol
with
his
eyes
one
morning
a
smudgy
spot
appears
upon
the
purple
forest
sea
about
fifteen
miles
to
the
northwest
the
lookout
gazes
for
a
moment
through
his
glass
and
although
not
certain
as
to
what
it
is
decides
to
get
the
distance
with
the
at
that
instant
however
the
wind
acts
upon
the
smudge
and
shows
that
a
fire
exists
and
reveals
its
position
a
ranger
through
a
telephone
at
the
forks
of
the
trail
below
hears
from
the
heights
small
fire
one
mile
south
of
mirror
lake
between
spruce
fork
and
bear
pass
trail
close
to
spring
in
less
than
an
hour
a
ranger
leaps
from
his
panting
pony
and
with
shovel
and
axe
hastily
digs
a
narrow
trench
through
the
vegetable
mould
in
a
circle
around
the
fire
then
a
few
shovelfuls
of
sand
go
upon
the
liveliest
blaze
and
the
fire
is
under
control
as
soon
as
there
lives
a
good
sympathetic
public
sentiment
concerning
the
forest
it
will
be
comparatively
easy
to
prevent
most
forest
fires
from
starting
and
to
extinguish
those
that
do
start
with
the
snow
over
i
started
for
the
scene
of
the
first
fire
and
on
the
way
noticed
how
much
more
rapidly
the
snow
melted
in
the
open
than
in
a
forest
the
autumn
sun
was
warm
and
at
the
end
of
the
first
day
most
of
the
snow
in
open
or
fireswept
places
was
gone
though
on
the
forest
floor
the
slushy
compacted
snow
still
retained
the
greater
portion
of
its
original
moisture
on
the
slopes
there
was
heavy
erosion
the
fire
had
destroyed
the
of
the
surface
and
consumed
the
trash
that
would
ordinarily
have
absorbed
and
delayed
the
water
running
off
but
this
unchecked
had
carried
off
with
it
tons
of
earthy
material
one
slope
on
the
first
burn
suffered
heavily
a
part
of
this
day
wash
was
deposited
in
a
beaver
pond
of
half
an
acre
which
was
filled
to
the
depth
of
three
feet
the
beavers
finding
their
subterranean
exits
filled
with
wash
had
escaped
by
tearing
a
hole
in
the
top
of
their
house
leaving
this
place
i
walked
across
the
range
to
look
at
a
fire
that
was
burning
beyond
the
bounds
of
the
snowfall
it
was
in
a
heavily
forested
cove
and
was
rapidly
undoing
the
constructive
work
of
centuries
this
cove
was
a
one
and
apparently
would
hold
the
fire
within
its
rocky
ridges
while
following
along
one
of
these
ridges
i
came
to
a
narrow
pass
the
only
break
in
the
confining
rocky
barrier
as
i
looked
at
the
fire
down
in
the
cove
it
was
plain
that
with
a
high
wind
the
fire
would
storm
this
pass
and
break
into
a
heavily
forested
alpine
realm
beyond
in
one
day
two
men
with
axes
could
have
made
this
pass
impregnable
to
the
assaults
of
any
fire
no
matter
how
swift
the
wind
ally
but
men
were
not
then
defending
our
forests
and
an
ill
wind
was
blowing
many
factors
help
to
determine
the
speed
of
these
fires
and
a
number
of
observations
showed
that
under
average
conditions
a
fire
burned
down
a
slope
at
about
one
mile
an
hour
on
the
level
it
traveled
from
two
to
eight
miles
an
hour
while
up
a
slope
it
made
from
eight
to
twelve
for
short
distances
fires
occasionally
roared
along
at
a
speed
of
fifty
or
sixty
miles
an
hour
and
made
a
terrible
gale
of
flames
i
hurried
up
into
the
alpine
realm
and
after
half
an
hour
scaled
a
promontory
and
looked
back
to
the
pass
a
great
cloud
of
smoke
was
streaming
up
just
beyond
and
after
a
minute
tattered
sheets
of
flame
were
shooting
high
above
it
presently
a
tornado
of
smoke
and
flame
surged
into
the
pass
and
for
some
seconds
nothing
could
be
seen
as
this
cleared
a
succession
of
tongues
and
sheets
of
flame
tried
to
reach
over
into
the
forest
on
the
other
side
of
the
pass
but
finally
gave
it
up
just
as
i
was
beginning
to
feel
that
the
forest
around
me
was
safe
a
arose
among
the
trees
by
the
pass
probably
during
the
first
assault
of
the
flames
a
fiery
dart
had
been
hurled
across
the
pass
up
the
shallow
forested
valley
below
me
came
the
flames
an
inverted
niagara
of
red
and
yellow
with
flying
spray
of
black
it
sent
forward
a
succession
of
whirlwinds
that
went
to
pieces
explosively
hurling
sparks
and
blazing
bark
far
and
high
during
one
of
its
wilder
displays
the
fire
rolled
forward
an
enormous
horizontal
whirl
of
flame
and
then
with
thunder
and
roar
the
molten
flames
swept
upward
into
a
wall
of
fire
this
tore
to
pieces
collapsed
and
fell
forward
in
fiery
disappearing
clouds
with
amazing
quickness
the
splendid
hanging
garden
on
the
terraced
heights
was
crushed
and
blackened
by
my
promontory
went
this
magnificent
zigzag
surging
front
of
flame
blowing
the
heavens
full
of
sparks
and
smoke
and
flinging
enormous
fiery
rockets
swift
and
slow
loud
and
low
swelling
and
vanishing
it
sang
its
eloquent
death
song
a
heavy
stratum
of
tarlike
smoke
formed
above
the
fire
as
it
toned
down
presently
this
black
stratum
was
uplifted
near
the
centre
and
then
pierced
with
a
stupendous
geyser
of
yellow
flame
which
reddened
as
it
fused
and
tore
through
the
tarry
smoke
and
then
gushed
astonishingly
high
above
a
year
or
two
prior
to
the
fire
a
snow
slide
from
the
heights
had
smashed
down
into
the
forest
more
than
ten
thousand
trees
were
mowed
raked
and
piled
in
one
mountainous
mass
of
wreckage
upon
some
crags
and
in
a
gulch
between
them
this
made
the
geyser
flames
and
a
bonfire
to
startle
even
the
giants
while
i
was
trying
to
account
for
this
extraordinary
display
there
came
a
series
of
explosions
in
rapid
succession
ending
in
a
violent
crashing
one
an
ominous
elemental
silence
followed
all
alone
i
had
enjoyed
the
surprises
the
threatening
uncertainties
and
the
dangerous
experiences
that
swiftly
came
with
the
battles
of
this
long
smoky
war
but
when
those
awful
explosions
came
i
for
a
time
wished
that
some
one
were
with
me
had
there
been
i
should
have
turned
and
asked
while
getting
a
better
grip
on
my
nerves
what
on
earth
is
that
while
the
startled
were
still
shuddering
with
the
shock
an
enormous
agitated
column
of
steam
shot
several
hundred
feet
upward
where
the
fiery
geyser
had
flamed
unable
to
account
for
these
strange
demonstrations
i
early
made
my
way
through
heat
and
smoke
to
the
big
bonfire
in
the
bottom
of
the
gulch
beneath
the
bonfire
flowed
a
small
stream
just
above
the
bonfire
this
stream
had
been
temporarily
dammed
by
fire
wreckage
on
being
released
the
accumulated
waters
thus
gathered
had
rushed
down
upon
the
rocks
and
cliffs
and
produced
these
explosions
in
the
morning
light
this
hanging
terraced
garden
of
forest
glory
was
a
stupendous
charcoal
drawing
of
desolation
insects
in
the
forest
insects
in
the
forest
the
big
trees
of
california
are
never
attacked
by
insects
this
immunity
is
extraordinary
and
may
be
the
chief
characteristic
that
enables
these
noble
trees
to
live
so
long
unfortunately
it
is
not
shared
by
other
species
the
american
forests
are
infested
with
thousands
of
species
of
injurious
and
destructive
insects
these
insects
like
the
forest
fires
annually
kill
numerous
forest
areas
and
in
addition
leave
millions
of
deformed
and
sickly
trees
scattered
through
the
living
forest
to
impair
and
imperil
it
after
some
general
tree
studies
which
have
occupied
odd
times
for
years
and
extended
through
the
groves
and
forests
of
every
state
and
territory
in
the
union
the
conclusion
has
been
forced
upon
me
that
the
forests
are
more
widely
wasted
by
insects
than
by
fire
some
of
nature
strange
ways
are
exhibited
in
the
interrelation
of
insects
and
fires
in
it
is
common
for
the
attack
of
one
of
these
to
open
the
way
for
the
depredations
of
the
other
the
trees
that
insects
kill
quickly
become
dry
and
inflammable
and
ready
kindling
for
the
forest
fire
on
the
other
hand
the
injuries
that
green
trees
often
receive
from
forest
fires
render
them
most
susceptible
to
the
attacks
of
insects
this
interrelation
almost
coöperation
between
these
of
the
forest
was
impressed
upon
me
during
my
early
tree
studies
one
day
i
enjoyed
a
splendid
forest
sea
from
the
summit
of
a
granite
crag
that
pierced
this
purple
expanse
near
the
crag
a
few
clumps
of
trees
stood
out
conspicuous
in
robes
of
sear
yellow
brown
unable
to
account
for
this
coloring
of
their
needles
i
went
down
and
looked
them
over
the
trees
had
recently
been
killed
by
insects
they
were
western
yellow
pine
and
their
needles
changed
to
greenish
yellow
still
clung
to
them
in
each
clump
of
these
pines
there
were
several
stunted
or
deformed
trees
or
trees
that
showed
a
recent
injury
the
stunted
and
injured
trees
in
these
clumps
were
attacked
and
killed
by
beetles
the
summer
before
my
visit
in
these
injured
trees
the
beetles
had
multiplied
and
they
emerged
the
following
summer
and
made
a
deadly
attack
upon
the
surrounding
vigorous
trees
although
this
latter
attack
was
made
only
a
month
or
two
before
my
arrival
the
trees
were
already
dead
and
their
needles
had
changed
to
a
sickly
greenish
yellow
amid
one
of
these
clumps
was
a
veteran
yellow
pine
that
lightning
had
injured
a
few
years
before
beetles
attacked
and
killed
this
old
pine
about
a
year
before
i
appeared
upon
the
scene
it
was
the
only
tree
in
this
now
dead
clump
that
was
attacked
on
that
first
occasion
but
some
weeks
before
my
visit
the
beetles
in
multiplied
numbers
swarmed
forth
from
it
and
speedily
killed
the
sound
neighboring
trees
these
conclusions
were
gathered
from
the
condition
of
the
trees
themselves
together
with
a
knowledge
of
beetle
habits
not
a
beetle
could
be
found
in
the
pine
and
its
needles
were
dry
and
yellow
the
dead
pines
were
full
of
beetles
and
their
eggs
the
needles
of
a
greenish
yellow
were
slightly
tough
and
still
contained
a
little
sap
while
i
was
in
camp
one
evening
in
the
midst
of
these
tree
studies
the
veteran
pine
now
dead
was
again
struck
by
lightning
as
everything
was
drenched
with
rain
there
appeared
to
be
no
likelihood
of
fire
however
the
following
morning
the
old
pine
was
ablaze
in
extinguishing
the
fire
i
found
that
it
had
started
at
the
base
of
the
tree
at
a
point
where
the
bolt
had
descended
and
entered
the
earth
at
this
place
there
was
an
accumulation
of
from
the
trunk
together
with
fallen
twigs
and
needles
from
the
dead
thus
a
dead
inflammable
tree
in
the
woods
is
kindling
which
at
any
moment
may
become
a
torch
and
set
fire
to
the
surrounding
green
forest
although
fires
frequently
sweep
through
and
destroy
a
green
forest
they
commonly
have
their
start
among
dead
trees
or
trash
the
pine
beetle
just
mentioned
attacks
and
burrows
into
trees
for
the
purpose
of
laying
its
eggs
therein
when
few
in
number
they
confine
their
attacks
to
trees
of
low
vitality
those
that
will
easily
succumb
to
their
attack
the
speedy
death
of
the
tree
and
the
resultant
chemical
change
in
its
sap
appear
to
be
necessary
for
the
of
the
deposited
eggs
or
the
youngsters
that
emerge
from
them
when
these
beetles
are
numerous
they
freely
attack
and
easily
kill
the
most
vigorous
of
trees
the
pine
beetle
is
one
of
a
dozen
species
of
bark
beetles
that
are
grouped
under
a
name
that
means
killer
of
trees
each
year
they
kill
many
acres
of
forest
and
almost
every
year
some
one
depredation
extends
over
several
thousand
acres
the
way
of
each
species
is
similar
to
that
of
the
others
the
beetles
of
each
species
vary
in
length
from
a
tenth
to
a
fifth
of
an
inch
they
migrate
in
midsummer
at
the
time
of
the
principal
attack
swarming
over
the
tree
they
at
once
bore
into
and
through
the
bark
here
short
transverse
or
vertical
galleries
are
run
and
in
these
the
eggs
are
laid
in
a
short
time
the
eggs
hatch
into
grubs
and
these
at
once
start
to
feed
upon
the
inner
bark
at
right
angles
to
the
galleries
extending
to
right
and
left
around
the
tree
it
does
not
require
many
of
them
to
girdle
the
tree
commonly
the
tree
is
dead
in
two
months
or
less
all
these
little
animals
remain
in
the
tree
until
late
spring
or
early
summer
when
they
emerge
in
multiplied
swarms
and
repeat
the
deadly
work
in
other
trees
the
depredations
of
these
insects
are
enormous
during
the
early
eighties
the
southern
pine
beetle
ruined
several
thousand
acres
of
pines
in
texas
ten
years
later
it
swarmed
through
western
north
carolina
virginia
and
west
virginia
to
southern
pennsylvania
and
over
an
area
aggregating
thousand
square
miles
and
killed
pines
of
all
species
and
ages
leaving
but
few
alive
within
the
past
few
years
the
mountain
and
western
pine
beetles
have
ruined
a
pine
tract
in
northeastern
oregon
destroying
not
less
than
ninety
per
cent
of
the
stand
during
the
past
decade
the
black
hills
beetle
has
been
active
over
the
rocky
mountains
where
in
some
districts
it
has
destroyed
from
ten
to
eighty
per
cent
of
the
western
yellow
pines
in
the
black
hills
the
forests
over
several
thousand
square
miles
are
ruined
these
trees
deteriorate
rapidly
in
most
cases
a
pine
is
pretty
well
rotted
in
five
years
and
usually
falls
to
pieces
in
less
than
a
decade
borers
attack
upon
the
heels
of
the
beetles
and
the
holes
made
by
the
beetles
admit
water
and
fungi
into
the
wood
this
rapidly
reduces
the
wood
to
a
punky
rotten
mass
one
day
in
colorado
i
tore
a
number
of
trees
to
pieces
and
was
busily
engaged
examining
the
numerous
population
of
grubs
and
borers
when
some
robins
and
other
birds
discovered
the
feast
collected
and
impatiently
awaited
their
turn
perceiving
the
situation
i
dragged
a
fragment
of
a
log
to
one
side
for
examination
while
the
birds
assembled
to
banquet
and
dispute
returning
to
the
rotten
logs
for
another
fragment
i
paused
to
watch
some
wasps
that
like
the
birds
were
feasting
upon
these
grubs
a
wasp
on
finding
a
grub
simply
thrust
his
snout
into
the
grub
and
then
braced
himself
firmly
as
he
bored
down
and
proceeded
to
suck
his
victim
fluids
in
throwing
a
log
to
one
side
i
disturbed
a
bevy
of
slender
banqueters
that
i
had
not
seen
instantly
a
number
of
wasps
were
effervescing
round
my
head
despite
busy
arms
they
effectively
peppered
my
face
and
i
fled
to
a
neighboring
brook
to
bathe
my
wounds
while
i
was
at
a
safe
distance
cogitating
as
to
the
wisdom
of
returning
for
further
examination
of
the
logs
a
black
bear
appeared
down
the
opening
from
his
actions
i
realized
that
he
had
scented
not
myself
but
the
feast
in
the
after
sniffling
pointing
and
he
lumbered
toward
the
logs
of
course
i
was
curious
as
to
the
manner
of
his
reception
and
allowed
him
to
go
unwarned
to
the
feast
two
rocky
mountain
jays
gave
a
low
indifferent
call
on
his
approach
but
the
other
birds
ignored
his
coming
with
his
fore
paw
he
tore
a
log
apart
and
deftly
picked
up
a
number
of
grubs
all
went
well
until
he
climbed
upon
the
pile
of
wreckage
and
rolled
a
broken
log
off
the
top
this
disturbed
another
wasp
feast
suddenly
he
grabbed
his
nose
with
both
fore
paws
and
tumbled
off
the
pile
for
a
few
seconds
he
was
slapping
and
battling
at
a
lively
pace
then
with
a
he
fled
straight
at
me
i
made
a
tangential
move
the
hardwoods
are
also
warred
upon
by
bugs
weevils
borers
and
fungi
the
percentage
of
swift
deaths
however
that
the
insects
cause
among
the
hardwoods
is
much
smaller
than
that
among
the
pines
but
the
percentage
of
diseased
and
hardwoods
is
much
greater
the
methods
of
beetles
that
attack
oaks
hickories
aspens
and
birches
are
similar
to
the
methods
of
those
that
attack
pines
and
spruces
they
attack
in
swarms
bore
through
the
bark
and
deposit
their
eggs
either
in
the
inner
bark
or
in
the
cambium
the
vitals
of
the
tree
the
grubs
on
hatching
begin
to
feed
upon
the
tree
vitals
in
this
feeding
each
grub
commonly
drives
a
minute
tunnel
from
one
to
several
inches
in
length
where
scores
of
grubs
hatch
side
by
side
they
drive
a
score
of
closely
parallel
tunnels
commonly
these
are
either
horizontal
or
vertical
and
generally
they
are
numerous
enough
to
make
many
complete
girdles
around
the
tree
girdling
means
cutting
off
the
circulation
and
this
produces
quick
death
while
these
beetles
are
busy
killing
unnumbered
millions
of
trees
annually
the
various
species
of
another
group
of
beetles
known
as
weevils
are
active
in
deforming
and
injuring
even
a
greater
number
they
mutilate
and
deform
trees
by
the
millions
the
work
of
the
weevil
is
particularly
devilish
it
deposits
its
eggs
in
the
vigorous
shoots
of
the
sapling
the
eggs
hatch
and
the
grubs
feed
upon
and
kill
the
shoot
another
shoot
bursts
forth
to
take
the
place
of
the
one
killed
this
is
attacked
and
either
killed
or
injured
the
result
is
a
stunted
crooked
and
tree
borers
attack
trees
both
old
and
young
of
many
species
and
a
few
of
these
species
with
wholesale
deadly
effect
birches
by
the
million
annually
fall
a
prey
to
these
and
their
deadly
work
has
almost
wiped
the
black
locust
out
of
existence
borers
pierce
and
honeycomb
the
if
their
work
is
not
fatal
it
is
speedily
extended
and
made
so
by
the
fungi
and
rot
that
its
holes
admit
into
the
tree
trees
like
people
often
entertain
a
number
of
troubles
at
once
and
have
misfortunes
in
series
a
seedling
injured
by
one
insect
is
more
likely
to
be
attacked
again
and
by
some
other
insect
than
is

sound
seedling
by
its
side
let
a
seedling
be
injured
and
relays
of
insects
often
several
species
at
a
time
and
each
species
with
a
way
of
its
own
will
attack
it
through

and
veteran
stages
of
its
growth
until
it
succumbs
or
let
a
vigorous
tree
meet
with
an
accident
and
like
an
injured
deer
it
becomes
food
for
an
enemy
if
lightning
wind
or
sleet
split
the
bark
or
break
a
limb
through
these
wounds
some
spore
or
borer
will
speedily
reach
the
tree
vitals
in
many
cases
the
deadly
work
of
parasitic
plants
and
fungi
is
interrelated
with
and
almost
inseparable
from
the
destructive
operations
of
predacious
insects
many
tree
diseases
are
but
the
spread
of
rot
and
fungi
through
the
wood
by
means
of
an
entrance
bored
by
a
borer
weevil
or
beetle
the

of
a

the
bark

eternally
vigilant
microbes
at
once
sow

with
the
seeds
of
destruction
or
decay
a
single
thoughtless
stroke
of
an
axe
in
the
bark
of
a
tree
may
admit
germs
that
will
produce
a
kind
of
and
cause
slow
death
the
fungus
apparently
can
spread
and
do
damage
only
as
it
is
admitted
into
the
tree
through
or
the
wounds
of
accidents
yet
its
annual
damage
is
almost
beyond
computation
this
rot
is
widely
distributed
and
affects
a
large
number
of
species
as
with
insects
its
outbreaks
often
occur
and
extend
over
wide
areas
upon
which
its
depredations
are
almost
complete
as
almost
all
trees
are
susceptible
to
this
it
will
not
be
easy
to
suppress

the
study
of
forest
insects
has
not
progressed
far
enough
to
enable
one
to
make
more
than
a
rough
approximation
of
the
number
of
the
important
species
that
attack
our
common
trees
however
more
than
five
hundred
species
are
known
to
afflict
the
sturdy

while
four
hundred
prey
upon
the
bending

the

supply
food
to
about
three
hundred
of
these
predacious
fellows
while
poplars
feed

shelter
almost
as
many
the
pines
and

are
compelled
permanently
to
pension
or
provide
for
about
three
hundred
families
of

the
recent
ravages
of
the
blight
and
the
appalling
depredations
of
the
gypsy
and
moths
together
with
other
evils
suggest
at
once
the
bigness
of
these
problems
and
the
importance
of
their
study
and
solution
the
insect
army
is
as
innumerable
as
the

in
the

this
army
occupies
points
of
vantage
in
every
part
of
the
tree
zone
has
an
insatiable
appetite
is
eternally
vigilant
for
invasion
and
is
eager
to
multiply
it
maintains
incessant
warfare
against
the
forest
and
every
tree
that
matures
must
run
a
gantlet
of
enemies
in
series
each
species
of
which
is
armed
with
weapons
long
specialized
for
the
tree
destruction
some
trees
escape
unscarred
though
countless
numbers
are
killed
and
multitudes
maimed
which
for
a

live
almost
useless

ever
ready

among
the
healthy

every

even
its
roots
are
cut
to
pieces
and
consumed
caterpillars
grubs
and
beetles
specialize
on
defoliation
and
feed
upon
the

the
lungs
of
the

the
partial
defoliation
of
the
tree
is
devitalizing
and
the
loss
of
all
its
leaves
commonly
kills
it
not
only
is
the
tree
itself
attacked
but
also
its
efforts
toward
reproduction
the

the

that
is
hungry
and
waiting
to
devour
it
the
moment
it
sprouts
it
is
gnawed
stung
bitten
and
bored
by

many
forest
trees
are
scarred
in
the
base
by
ground
fires
these
trees
are
entered
by
insects
through
the
scars
and
become
sources
of
rot
and
insect
infection
although
these
trees
may
for
a
time
live
on
it
is
with
a
rotten
heart
or
as
a
mere
hollow
shell
a
forest
fire
that
sweeps
raging
through
the
has
a
very
different
effect
the
twigs
and
bark
are
burned
off
and
the
pitches
are
boiled
through
the
exterior
of
the
trunk
and
the
wood
fortified
against
all
sources
of
decay
this
preservative
treatment
often
gives
long
endurance
to
timber
especially
when
the
trees
killed
are
yellow
pine
or
douglas
spruce
many
a

in
the
rocky

my
eager
blazing
was
burning
timber
that
forest
fires
had
killed
forty
and
even
sixty
years
before
in
forest
protection
and

the
insect
factor
is
one
that
will
not
easily
down
controlling
the
depredations
of
beetles
borers
weevils
and
fungi
calls
for
work
of
magnitude
but
work
that
insures
success
this
work
consists
of
the
constant
removal
of
both
the
infected
trees
and
the
dwarfed
or
injured
ones
that
are
susceptible
to
infection
most
forest
insects
multiply
with
amazing
rapidity
some
mother
may
have
half
a
million
descendants
in
less
than
two
years
thus
efforts
for
the
control
of
insect
outbreaks
should
begin
at
once
in
the
early
stages
of
their
activity
a
single
infested
tree
may
in
a
year
or
two
spread
destruction
through
thousands
of
acres
of
forest
most
insects
have
enemies
to
bite
them
the
spreads
death
among
injurious
grubs
efforts
to
control
will
embrace
the
giving
of
aid
and
comfort
to
those
insects
that
prey
upon
them
bugs
will
be
hunted
with
bugs
already
the
gypsy
moth
in
the
east
is
being
fought
in
this
way
many
species
of
birds
feed
freely
upon
weevils
borers
and
beetles
of
these
birds
the
woodpeckers
are
the
most
important
they
must
be
protected
and
encouraged
there
are
other
methods
of
fighting
the
enemy
a
striking
and
successful
device
for
putting
an
end
to
the
beetle
is
to
a
spruce
here
and
there
in
the
forest
at
a
season
when
the
physiological
of
the
tree
will
cause
it
to
change
into
a
condition
most
favorable
for
the
attraction
of
beetles
like
carrion
this
changed
condition
appears
to
be
scented
from
all
quarters
and
afar
swarms
of
beetles
concentrate
their
attack
upon
this
tree
and
bury
themselves
in
it
and
deposit
their
eggs
the
multiplied
army
will
remain
in
the
tree
until
late
spring
thus
months
of
time
may
be
had
to
cut

the
freedom
of

attacks
suggests
that
man
as
well
as

may
develop
or

species
of

that
will
better

insects
are

damaging

to
the

one

we
believe
to
be

yet
these

only
begin
to
tell
the

they
tell
only
the

of

the

higher

forest

nature
selected
the
woodpecker
to
be
the
chief
caretaker
the
physician
and
surgeon
of
the
tree
world
this
is
a
stupendous
task
forests
are
extensive
and
are
formed
of
hundreds
of
species
of
trees
the
american
woodpeckers
have
the
supervision
of
uncounted
acres
that
are
forested
with
more
than
six
hundred
kinds
of
trees
with
the
exception
of
the
california
big

each
tree
species
is
preyed
upon
by
scores
and
many
species
by
hundreds
of
injurious
and
deadly
insects
five
hundred
kinds
of
insects
are
known
to
prey
upon
the

and
a
complete
count
may
show
a
thousand
kinds
many
of
these
insects
multiply
with
amazing
rapidity
and
at
all
times
countless
numbers
of
these
aggressive
pests
form
warrior
armies
with
which
the
woodpecker
must
constantly
contend
in
this
incessant
struggle
with

the
woodpecker
has
helpful
assistance
from
many
other
bird
families
though
the
woodpecker
gives
general
attention
to
hundreds
of
kinds
of
insects
he
specializes
on
those
which
injure
the
tree
internally
which
require
a
surgical
operation
to
obtain
he
is
a
distinguished
specialist
the
instruments
for
are
intrusted
to
his
keeping
and
with
these
he
each
year
performs
innumerable
successful
surgical
operations
upon
our
friends
the
trees
woodpeckers
are
as
widely
distributed
as

just
how
many
to
the

mile
no
one
knows
some
localities
are
blessed
with
a
goodly
number
made
up
of
representatives
from
three
or
four
of
our
woodpecker
species
forest
shade
and
orchard
trees
receive
their
impartial
attention
the
annual
saving
from
their
service
is
enormous
although
this
can
not
be
estimated
it
can
hardly
be
overstated
a
single
borer
may
kill
a
tree
so
too
may
a
few
beetles
while
a
small
number
of
weevils
will
injure
and
stunt
a
tree
so
that
it
is
left
an
easy
victim
for
other
insects
borers
beetles
and
weevils
are
among
the
worst
enemies
of
trees
they
multiply
with
astounding
rapidity
and
annually
kill
millions
of
scattered
trees
annually
too
there
are
numerous
outbreaks
of
beetles
whose
depredations
extend
over
hundreds
and
occasionally
over
thousands
of
acres
caterpillars
moths
and
are
exceedingly
injurious
but
they
damage
the
outer
parts
of
the
tree
both
they
and
their
eggs
are
easily
accessible
to
many
kinds
of
birds
including
the
woodpeckers
but
borers
beetles
and
weevils
live
and
deposit
their
eggs
in
the
very
vitals
of
the
tree
in
the
tree
vitals
protected
by
a
heavy
barrier
of
wood
or
bark
they
are
secure
from
the
beaks
and
claws
of
all
birds
except
woodpecker
the
chief
surgeon
of
the
forest
about
the
only
opportunity
that
other
birds
have
to
feed
upon
borers
and
beetles
is
during
the
brief
time
they
occupy
in
emerging
from
the
tree
that
they
have
killed
in
their
flight
to
some
live
tree
and
during
their
brief
exposure
while
boring
into
it
beetles
live
and
move
in
swarms
and
according
to
their
numbers
concentrate
their
attack
upon
a
single
tree
or
upon
many
trees
most
beetles
are
one
of
a
dozen
species
of
which
means
left
in
undisturbed
possession
of
a
tree
many
mother
beetles
may
have
half
a
million
descendants
in
a
single
season
fortunately
for
the
forest
woodpecker
during
his
ceaseless
round
of
inspection
and
service
generally
discovers
infested
trees
if
one
woodpecker
is
not
equal
to
the
situation
many
are
concentrated
at
this
place
and
here
they
remain
until
the
last
dweller
in
darkness
is
reached
and
devoured
thus
most
beetle
outbreaks
are
prevented
now
and
then
all
the
conditions
are
favorable
for
the
beetles
or
the
woodpecker
may
be
persecuted
and
lose
some
of
his
family
so
that
despite
his
utmost
efforts
he
fails
to
make
the
rounds
of
his
forest
and
the
result
is
an
outbreak
of
insects
with
wide
depredations
so
important
are
these
birds
that
the
shooting
of
a
single
one
may
allow
insects
to
multiply
and
waste
acres
of
forest
during
the
periods
in
which
the
insects
are
held
in
check
the
woodpecker
ranges
through
the
forest
inspecting
tree
after
tree
many
times
during
their
tireless
rounds
of
search
and
inspection
i
have
followed
them
for
hours
on
one
occasion
in
the
mountains
of
colorado
i
followed
a
batchelder
woodpecker
through
a
spruce
forest
all
day
long
both
of
us
had
a
busy
day
he
inspected
eight
hundred
and
trees
most
of
which
were
spruce
or
pine
although
he
moved
quickly
he
was
intensely
concentrated
was
systematic
and
apparently
did
the
inspection
carefully
the
forest
was
a
healthy
one
and
harbored
only
straggling
insects
now
and
then
he
picked
up
an
isolated
insect
from
a
limb
or
took
an
from
a
break
in
the
bark
on
a
trunk
only
two
pecking
operations
were
required
on
another
occasion
i
watched
a
hairy
woodpecker
spend
more
than
three
days
upon
one
this
he
pecked
full
of
holes
and
from
its
vitals
he
dragged
more
than
a
gross
of
devouring
grubs
in
this
case
not
only
was
the
beetle
colony
destroyed
but
the
tree
survived
woodpecker
holes
commonly
are
shallow
except
in
dead
trees
most
of
the
burrowing
or
boring
insects
which
infest
living
trees
work
in
the
outermost
sapwood
just
beneath
the
bark
or
in
the
inner
bark
hence
the
doctor
does
not
need
to
cut
deeply
in
most
cases
his
peckings
in
the
wood
are
so
shallow
that
no
scar
or
record
is
found
hence
a
tree
might
be
operated
on
by
him
a
dozen
times
in
a
season
and
still
not
show
a
scar
when
split
or
sawed
into
pieces
most
of
his
peckings
simply
penetrate
the
bark
and
on
living
trees
this
epidermis
scales
off
thus
in
a
short
time
all
traces
of
his
are
obliterated
i
have
however
in
dissecting
and
studying
fallen
trees
found
a
number
of
deep
holes
in
their
trunks
which
woodpeckers
had
made
years
before
the
trees
came
to
their
death
in
one
instance
as
i
have
related
in
the
story
of
a
pine
in
wild
life
on
the
rockies
a
deep
oblong
hole
was
pecked
in
a
pine
nearly
eight
hundred
years
before
it
died
the
hole
filled
with
pitch
and
was
overgrown
with
bark
and
wood

woodpecker
holes
in
a
pine
injured
by
lightning
woodpeckers
commonly
nest
in
a
dead
limb
or
trunk
a
number
of
feet
from
the
ground
here
in
the
heart
of
things
they
excavate
a
moderately
roomy
nest
it
is
common
for
many
woodpeckers
to
peck
out
a
deep
hole
in
a
dead
tree
for
individual
shelter
during
the
winter
generally
neither
nest
nor
winter
lodging
is
used
longer
than
a
season
the
abandoned
holes
are
welcomed
as
shelters
and
by
many
birds
that
prefer
houses
but
can
not
themselves
construct
them
chickadees
and
bluebirds
often
nest
in
them
screech
owls
frequently
philosophize
within
these
retreats
on
bitter
cold
nights
these
holes
shelter
and
save
birds
of
many
species
one
autumn
day
while
watching
beneath
a
pine
i
saw
fifteen
brown
nuthatches
issue
from
a
woodpecker
hole
in
a
dead
limb
just
what
they
were
doing
inside
i
can
not
imagine
the
extraordinary
number
that
had
gathered
therein
made
the
incident
so
unusual
that
for
a
long
time
i
hesitated
to
tell
it
however
early
one
autumn
frank
chapman
climbed
up
the
mountainside
to
see
me
and
while
resting
on
the
way
up
he
beheld
nuthatches
emerge
from
a
hole
in
a
pine
by
tapping
against
dead
i
have
often
roused
mother
woodpecker
from
her
nest
thrusting
out
her
head
from
a
hole
far
above
she
peered
down
with
one
eye
and
comically
tilted
her
head
to
discover
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
with
long
nose
and
head
tilted
to
one
side
she
had
both
a
storky
and
a
philosophical
appearance
the
woodpecker
more
than
any
other
bird
of
my
acquaintance
at
times
actually
appears
to
need
only
a
pair
of
spectacles
upon
his
nose
in
order
fully
to
complete
his
attitude
and
expression
of
wisdom
the
downy
woodpecker
the
smallest
member
of
a
family
of
distinguished
species
is
the
honored
one
he
is
a
confiding
little
fellow
and
i
have
often
accompanied
him
on
his
daily
rounds
he
does
not
confine
his
attacks
to
the
concealed
enemies
of
the
trees
but
preys
freely
upon
caterpillars
and
other
enemies
which
feast
upon
their
leaves
and
bloom
he
appears
most
content
close
to
the
haunts
of
man
and
spends
much
of
his
time
caring
for
orchards
and
cleaning
up
the
shade
trees
one
morning
in
missouri
a
downy
alighted
against
the
base
of
an
apple
tree
within
a
few
feet
of
where
i
was
standing
he
arrived
with
an
undulating
flight
and
swept
in
sideways
toward
the
trunk
as
though
thrown
spat
he
struck
for
a
moment
he
stuck
motionless
then
he
began
to
sidle
round
and
up
the
trunk
every
now
and
then
he
tapped
with
his
bill
or
else
stopped
to
peer
into
a
he
devoured
an
insect
a
spider
and
a
beetle
of
some
kind
before
ascending
to
the
first
limb
just
below
the
point
of
a
limb
attachment
he
edged
about
giving
the
a
rattling
patter
of
taps
with
his
bill
he
was
sounding
for
something
presently
a
spot
appeared
to
satisfy
him
adjusting
himself
he
rained
blows
with
his
bill
upon
this
tilting
his
head
and
directing
the
strokes
with
an
apparently
automatic
action
now
and
then
giving
a
side
swipe
with
his
bill
probably
to
tear
out
a
splinter
or
throw
off
a
chip
in
six
minutes
his
prey
was
evidently
in
sight
then
he
enlarged
the
hole
and
slightly
deepened
it
vertically
pausing
he
thrust
his
head
into
the
hole
and
his
bill
into
a
cavity
beyond
with
a
backward
tug
he
pulled
his
head
out
then
his
bill
and
at
last
his
extended
tongue
with
a
grub
impaled
on
its
barbed
point
this
grub
was
dragged
from
the
bottom
of
a
crooked
gallery
at
a
point
more
than
three
inches
beyond
the
bottom
of
the
pecked
hole
a
useful
tool
this
tongue
of
his
a
flexible
extensible
spear
in
another
tree
he
uncovered
a
feast
of
ants
and
their
eggs
once
a
grasshopper
alighted
against
another
up
which
he
was
climbing
downy
seized
him
instantly
in
one
he
consumed
an
entire
colony
in
four
hours
he
examined
the
trunks
larger
limbs
and
many
of
the
smaller
ones
of
one
hundred
and
apple
trees
in
this
time
he
made
excavations
five
of
which
were
large
ones
among
the
insects
devoured
were
beetles
ants
their
eggs
and
their
aphids
a
grasshopper
a
moth
or
two
and
a
colony
of
caterpillars
i
followed
him
closely
and
frequently
was
within
a
few
feet
of
him
often
i
saw
his
eyes
or
rather
one
eye
at
a
time
and
a
number
of
times
i
imagined
him
about
to
look
round
and
with
merry
laugh
fly
away
for
he
frequently
acted
like
a
happy
child
who
is
closely
watching
you
while
all
the
time
merrily
pretending
not
to
see
you
yet
in
all
those
four
hours
he
did
not
do
a
single
thing
which
showed
that
he
knew
of
my
nearness
or
even
of
my
existence
examining
each
tree
in
turn
he
moved
down
a
long
row
and
at
the
end
flew
without
the
slightest
pause
to
the
first
tree
in
the
next
row
from
here
he
examined
a
line
of
trees
diagonally
across
the
orchard
to
the
farther
corner
here
he
followed
along
the
outside
row
until
he
flew
away
the
line
of
his
inspection
from
the
time
i
first
saw
him
until
he
flew
away
formed
a
big
letter
during
a
in
a
pine
forest
a
dead
tree
fell
near
me
and
a
flying
limb
knocked
a
downy
stunned
to
the
earth
by
my
feet
on
reviving
in
my
hands
he
showed
but
little
excitement
and
when
my
hands
opened
he
pushed
himself
off
as
though
to
dive
to
the
earth
but
he
skimmed
and
swung
upward
landing
against
a
about
twenty
feet
distant
up
this
he
at
once
began
to
skate
and
sidle
exploring
away
as
though
nothing
had
happened
and
i
were
only
a
stump
little
boy
grizzly
little
boy
grizzly
one
day
while
wandering
in
the
pine
woods
on
the
slope
of
mt
meeker
i
came
upon
two
young
grizzly
bears
though
they
dodged
about
as
lively
as
chickens
i
at
last
cornered
them
in
a
penlike
pocket
of
fallen
trees
getting
them
into
a
sack
was
one
of
the
liveliest
experiences
i
ever
had
though
small
and
almost
starved
these
little
orphans
proceeded
to
chew
me
up
after
the
manner
of
big
grizzlies
as
is
told
of
them
in
books
after
an
exciting
chase
and
tussle
i
would
catch
one
and
thrust
him
into
the
sack
in
resisting
he
would
insert
his
claws
into
my
clothes
or
thrust
them
through
the
side
of
the
sack
then
while
i
was
trying
to
tear
him
loose
or
to
thrust
him
forcibly
in
he
would
lay
hold
of
a
finger
or
take
a
bite
in
my
leg
whenever
he
bit
i
at
once
dropped
him
and
then
all
began
over
again
their
mother
had
been
killed
a
few
days
before
i
found
them
so
of
course
they
were
famished
and
in
need
of
a
home
but
so
bitterly
did
they
resist
my
efforts
that
i
barely
succeeded
in
taking
them
though
hardly
so
large
as
a
collie
when
he
is
at
his
prettiest
they
were
nimble
athletes
at
last
i
started
home
the
sack
over
my
shoulder
with
these
lively
in
the
bottom
of
it
their
final
demonstration
was
not
needed
to
convince
me
of
the
extraordinary
power
of
their
jaws
nevertheless
while
going
down
a
steep
slope
one
managed
to
bite
into
my
back
through
sack
and
clothes
so
effectively
that
i
responded
with
a
yell
then
i
fastened
the
sack
at
the
end
of
a
long
pole
which
i
carried
across
my
shoulder
and
i
was
able
to
travel
the
remainder
of
the
distance
to
my
cabin
without
another
attack
in
the
rear
of
course
the
youngsters
did
not
need
to
be
taught
to
eat
i
simply
pushed
their
noses
down
into
a
basin
of
milk
and
the
little
red
tongues
at
once
began
to
ply
then
raw
eggs
and
bread
were
dropped
into
the
basin
there
was
no
hesitation
between
courses
they
simply
gobbled
the
food
as
long
as
i
kept
it
before
them
jenny
and
johnny
were
pets
before
sundown
though
both
were
alert
johnny
was
the
wiser
and
the
more
cheerful
of
the
two
he
took
training
as
readily
as
a
collie
or
and
i
have
never
seen
any
dog
more
playful
all
bears
are
keen
of
wit
but
he
was
the
brightest
one
of
the
wild
folk
that
i
have
ever
known
he
grew
rapidly
and
ate
me
almost
out
of
supplies
we
were
intimate
friends
in
less
than
a
month
and
i
spent
much
time
playing
and
talking
with
him
one
of
the
first
things
i
taught
him
was
when
hungry
to
stand
erect
with
arms
extended
almost
horizontally
with
palms
forward
i
also
taught
him
to
greet
me
in
this
manner
one
day
after
two
weeks
with
me
he
climbed
to
the
top
of
a
pole
fence
to
which
he
was
chained
up
there
he
had
a
great
time
he
perched
gazed
here
and
there
pranced
back
and
forth
and
finally
fell
off
his
chain
tangled
and
caught
for
a
few
seconds
he
dangled
in
the
air
by
the
neck
then
slipped
through
his
collar
and
galloped
off
up
the
mountainside
and
quickly
disappeared
in
the
woods
i
supposed
he
was
gone
for
good
although
i
followed
for
several
hours
i
did
not
even
catch
sight
of
him
this
little
boy
had
three
days
of
runaway
life
and
then
concluded
to
return
hunger
drove
him
back
i
saw
him
coming
and
went
to
meet
him
but
kept
out
of
sight
until
he
was
within
twenty
feet
then
stepped
into
view
apparently
a
confused
or
entangled
mental
condition
followed
my
appearance
his
first
impulse
was
to
let
me
know
that
he
was
hungry
by
standing
erect
and
outstretching
his
arms
this
he
started
hastily
to
do
in
the
midst
of
this
performance
it
occurred
to
him
that
if
he
wanted
anything
to
eat
he
must
hurry
to
me
so
he
interrupted
his
first
action
and
started
to
carry
his
second
into
instant
effect
these
incomplete
proceedings
interrupted
and
tripped
one
another
three
or
four
times
in
rapid
succession
though
he
tumbled
about
in
comic
confusion
while
trying
to
do
two
things
at
once
it
was
apparent
through
all
that
his
central
idea
was
to
get
something
to
eat
illustration
johnny
and
jenny
and
this
as
with
all
boys
was
his
central
idea
much
of
the
time
i
did
not
find
anything
that
he
would
not
eat
he
simply
gobbled
scraps
from
the
table
mountain
sage
rhubarb
dandelion
and
apples
of
course
being
a
boy
he
liked
apples
best
of
all
if
i
approached
him
with
meat
and
honey
upon
a
plate
and
with
an
apple
in
my
pocket
he
would
smell
the
apple
and
begin
to
dance
before
me
ignoring
the
eatables
in
sight
instantly
on
permission
he
would
clasp
me
with
both
fore
paws
and
thrust
his
nose
into
the
apple
pocket
often
standing
between
him
and
jenny
i
alternately
fed
each
a
bit
a
few
times
i
broke
the
regular
order
and
gave
jenny
two
bits
in
succession
at
this
johnny
raged
and
usually
ended
by
striking
desperately
at
me
i
never
flinched
and
the
wise
little
rogue
made
it
a
point
each
time
to
miss
me
by
an
inch
or
two
a
few
other
people
tried
this
irritating
experiment
with
him
but
he
hit
them
every
time
however
i
early
tried
to
prevent
anything
being
done
that
teased
or
irritated
him
visitors
did
occasionally
tease
him
and
frequently
they
fed
the
two
on
knickknacks
occasionally
the
two
quarreled
but
not
more
frequently
than
two
ordinary
children
and
these
quarrels
were
largely
traceable
to
food
mixtures
anyway
bears
will
maintain
a
better
disposition
with
a
diet
of
putrid
meat
snakes
mice
and
weeds
than
upon
desserts
of
human
concoction
naturally
bears
are
and
cheerful
they
like
to
romp
and
play
johnny
played
by
the
hour
most
of
the
time
he
was
chained
to
a
low
small
shed
that
was
built
for
his
accommodation
scores
of
times
each
day
he
covered
all
the
territory
that
could
be
traversed
while
he
was
fastened
with
a
chain
often
he
skipped
back
and
forth
in
a
straight
line
for
an
hour
or
more
these
were
not
the
restless
aimless
movements
of
the
caged
tiger
but
those
of
playful
happy
activity
it
was
a
pleasure
to
watch
this
eager
play
in
it
he
would
gallop
to
the
outer
limit
of
his
chain
then
reversing
his
legs
without
turning
his
body
go
backward
with
a
queer
lively
to
the
other
end
then
gallop
forward
again
he
knew
the
length
of
his
chain
to
an
inch
no
matter
how
wildly
he
rushed
after
some
dog
he
was
never
jerked
off
his
feet
by
forgetting
his
limitations
he
and
scotch
my
collie
were
good
friends
and
jolly
playmates
in
their
favorite
play
scotch
tried
to
take
a
bone
which
johnny
guarded
this
brought
out
from
both
a
lively
lot
of
feinting
dodging
grabbing
and
striking
occasionally
they
clinched
and
when
this
ended
johnny
usually
tried
for
a
good
bite
or
two
on
scotch
shaggy
tail
scotch
appeared
always
to
have
in
mind
that
the
end
of
nose
was
sensitive
and
he
landed
many
a
good
slap
on
this
spot
apparently
johnny
early
appreciated
the
fact
that
i
would
not
tease
him
and
also
that
i
was
a
master
who
must
be
obeyed
one
day
however
he
met
with
a
little
mishap
misjudged
things
and
endeavored
to
make
it
lively
for
me
i
had
just
got
him
to
the
point
where
he
enjoyed
a
in
this
chair
he
sat
up
like
a
little
man
sometimes
his
fore
paws
lay
awkwardly
in
his
lap
but
more
often
each
rested
on
an
arm
of
the
big
chair
he
found
rocking
such
a
delight
that
it
was
not
long
until
he
learned
to
rock
himself
this
brought
on
the
mishap
he
had
grown
and
one
day
was
rocking
with
great
enthusiasm
suddenly
the
big
rocker
little
man
and
all
went
over
backward
though
standing
by
i
was
unable
to
save
him
and
did
not
move
seeing
his
angry
look
when
he
struck
the
floor
and
guessing
his
next
move
i
leaped
upon
the
table
up
he
sprang
and
delivered
a
vicious
blow
that
barely
missed
but
which
knocked
a
piece
out
of
my
trousers
apparently
no
other
large
animal
has
such
intense
curiosity
as
the
grizzly
an
object
in
the
distance
a
scent
a
sound
or
a
trail
may
arouse
this
and
for
a
time
overcome
his
intense
and
wary
vigilance
in
satisfying
this
curiosity
he
will
do
unexpected
and
apparently
bold
things
but
the
instant
the
mystery
is
solved
he
is
himself
again
and
may
run
for
dear
life
from
some
situation
into
which
his
curiosity
has
unwittingly
drawn
him
an
unusual
noise
behind
johnny
shed
would
bring
him
out
with
a
rush
to
determine
what
it
was
if
not
at
once
satisfied
as
to
the
cause
he
would
put
his
fore
paws
on
the
top
of
the
shed
and
peer
over
in
the
most
eager
and
inquiring
manner
imaginable
like
a
scout
he
spied
mysterious
and
dim
objects
afar
if
a
man
a
dog
or
a
horse
appeared
in
the
distance
he
quickly
discovered
the
object
and
at
once
stood
erect
with
fore
paws
drawn
up
until
he
had
a
good
look
at
it
the
instant
he
made
out
what
it
was
he
lost
interest
in
it
at
all
times
he
was
vigilant
to
know
what
was
going
on
about
him
he
was
like
a
boy
in
his
fondness
for
water
usually
when
unchained
and
given
the
freedom
of
the
place
he
would
spend
much
of
the
time
in
the
brook
rolling
playing
and
wading
he
and
i
had
a
few
and
usually
in
order
to
give
me
a
better
chance
we
ran
down
hill
in
a
dash
he
usually
paused
three
or
four
times
and
waited
for
me
to
catch
up
and
i
was
not
a
slow
biped
either
the
grizzly
though
apparently
awkward
and
lumbering
is
really
one
of
the
most
agile
of
beasts
i
constantly
marveled
at
johnny
lightness
of
touch
or
the
deftness
of
movement
of
his
fore
paws
with
but
one
claw
touching
it
he
could
slide
a
coin
back
and
forth
on
the
floor
more
rapidly
and
lightly
than
i
could
he
would
slide
an
eggshell
swiftly
along
without
breaking
it
yet
by
using
but
one
paw
he
could
without
apparent
effort
overturn
rocks
that
were
heavier
than
himself
one
day
while
he
slept
in
the
yard
outstretched
in
the
sun
i
opened
a
large
umbrella
and
put
it
over
him
and
waited
near
for
him
to
wake
up
by
and
by
the
sleepy
eyes
half
opened
but
without
a
move
he
closed
them
and
slept
again
presently
he
was
wide
awake
making
a
quiet
study
of
the
strange
thing
over
him
but
except
to
roll
his
eyes
not
a
move
did
he
make
then
a
puff
of
wind
gave
sudden
movement
to
the
umbrella
rolling
it
over
a
point
or
two
at
this
he
leaped
to
his
feet
terribly
frightened
and
made
a
dash
to
escape
this
mysterious
monster
but
as
he
jumped
the
wind
whirled
the
umbrella
and
plump
into
it
he
landed
an
instant
of
desperate
clawing
and
he
shook
off
the
wrecked
umbrella
and
fled
in
terror
a
minute
or
two
later
i
found
him
standing
behind
the
house
still
frightened
and
trembling
when
i
came
up
and
spoke
to
him
he
made
three
or
four
lively
attempts
to
bite
my
ankles
plainly
he
felt
that
i
had
played
a
mean
and
trick
upon
him
i
talked
to
him
for
some
time
and
endeavored
to
explain
the
matter
to
him
a
sudden
movement
of
a
new
or
mysterious
object
will
usually
frighten
any
animal
on
more
than
one
occasion
people
have
taken
advantage
of
this
characteristic
of
wild
beasts
and
prevented
an
attack
upon
themselves
in
one
instance
i
unconsciously
used
it
to
my
advantage
in
the
woods
one
day
as
i
have
related
elsewhere
two
wolves
and
myself
unexpectedly
met
with
bared
teeth
they
stood
ready
to
leap
upon
me
needing
something
to
keep
up
my
courage
and
divert
my
thoughts
it
occurred
to
me
to
snap
a
picture
of
them
this
effectively
broke
the
spell
for
when
the
kodak
door
flew
open
they
wheeled
and
fled
autumn
came
and
i
was
to
leave
for
a
forestry
tour
the
only
man
that
i
could
persuade
to
stay
at
my
place
for
the
winter
was
one
who
neither
understood
nor
sympathized
with
my
and
aggressive
young
grizzly
realizing
that
the
man
and
the
bear
would
surely
clash
and
perhaps
to
the
man
disadvantage
i
settled
things
once
and
for
all
by
sending
johnny
to
the
denver
zoo
he
was
seven
months
old
when
we
parted
and
apparently
as
much
attached
to
me
as
any
dog
to
master
i
frequently
had
news
of
him
but
let
two
years
go
by
before
i
allowed
myself
the
pleasure
of
visiting
him
he
was
lying
on
the
ground
asleep
when
i
called
while
around
him
a
number
of
other
bears
were
walking
about
he
was
no
longer
a
boy
bear
but
a
big
fellow
in
my
eagerness
to
see
him
i
forgot
to
be
cautious
and
climbing
to
the
top
of
the
picket
fence
leaped
into
the
pen
calling
hello
johnny
as
i
leaped
and
repeating
this
greeting
as
i
landed
on
the
ground
beside
him
he
jumped
up
fully
awake
and
at
once
recognized
me
instantly
he
stood
erect
with
both
arms
extended
and
gave
a
few
happy
grunts
of
joy
and
by
way
of
greeting
i
talked
to
him
for
a
little
while
and
patted
him
as
i
talked
then
i
caught
a
fore
paw
in
my
hand
and
we
hopped
and
pranced
about
as
in
old
times
a
yell
from
the
outside
brought
me
to
my
senses
instinctively
i
glanced
about
for
a
way
of
escape
though
i
really
did
not
feel
that
i
was
in
danger
we
were
however
the
observed
of
all
observers
and
i
do
not
know
which
throng
was
staring
with
greater
interest
and
astonishment
the
bears
in
the
pen
or
the
spectators
on
the
outside
alone
with
a
landslide
alone
with
a
landslide
realizing
the
importance
of
traveling
as
lightly
as
possible
during
my
hasty
trip
through
the
uncompahgre
mountains
i
allowed
myself
to
believe
that
the
golden
days
would
continue
accordingly
i
set
off
with
no
bedding
with
but
little
food
and
without
even
snowshoes
a
few
miles
up
the
trail
above
lake
city
i
met
a
prospector
coming
down
and
out
of
these
mountains
for
the
winter
yes
he
said
the
first
snow
usually
is
a
heavy
one
and
i
am
going
out
now
for
fear
of
being
for
the
winter
my
imagination
at
once
pictured
the
grand
mountains
deeply
splendidly
covered
with
snow
myself
by
a
in
a
solemn
primeval
forest
without
food
or
bedding
a
on
a
limb
sympathizing
with
me
in
low
confiding
tones
the
snow
and
then
i
dismissed
the
imaginary
picture
of
winter
and
joyfully
climbed
the
grand
old
mountains
amid
the
low
and
leafless
aspens
and
the
tall
and
richly
robed
firs
i
was
impelled
to
try
to
make
this
mountain
realm
a
national
forest
and
felt
that
sometime
it
would
become
a
national
park
the
wonderful
reports
of
prospectors
about
the
scenery
of
this
region
together
with
what
i
knew
of
it
from
incomplete
exploration
eloquently
urged
this
course
upon
me
my
plan
was
to
make
a
series
of
photographs
from
commanding
heights
and
slopes
that
would
illustrate
the
forest
wealth
and
the
scenic
grandeur
of
this
wonderland
in
the
centre
uncompahgre
peak
rose
high
and
by
girdling
it
a
little
above
the
timber
i
obtained
a
number
of
the
desired
photographs
and
then
hurried
from
height
to
height
taking
other
pictures
of
towering
summits
or
their
slopes
below
that
were
black
and
purpling
with
impressive
pathless
forests
the
second
evening
i
went
into
camp
among
some
picturesque
trees
upon
a
skyline
at
an
altitude
of
eleven
thousand
feet
above
the
tides
while
gathering
wood
for
a
fire
i
paused
to
watch
the
moon
a
great
globe
of
luminous
gold
rise
strangely
silently
into
the
mellow
haze
of
autumn
night
for
a
moment
on
the
horizon
it
paused
to
peep
from
behind
a
crag
into
a
scattered
group
of
weird
trees
on
a
ridge
before
me
then
swiftly
floated
up
into
lonely
misty
space
just
before
i
lay
down
for
the
night
i
saw
a
in
the
dim
low
distance
that
was
creeping
up
into
my
moonlit
world
of
mountains
other
shadowy
forms
followed
it
a
little
past
midnight
i
was
awakened
by
the
rain
falling
gently
coldly
upon
my
face
as
i
stood
shivering
with
my
back
to
the
fire
there
fell
an
occasional
feathery
flake
of
snow
had
my
snowshoes
been
with
me
a
different
lot
of
experiences
would
have
followed
with
them
i
should
have
stayed
in
camp
and
watched
the
filmy
flakes
form
their
beautiful
white
feathery
bog
upon
the
earth
watched
robes
rugs
and
drapery
decorate
rocks
and
cliffs
or
the
fir
trees
come
out
in
pointed
spearhead
caps
or
the
festoons
form
upon
the
limbs
of
dead
and
lifeless
trees
crumbling
in
the
midst
of
growing
forest
life
to
be
without
food
or
snowshoes
in
faraway
mountain
snows
is
about
as
serious
as
to
be
adrift
in
a
lifeboat
without
food
or
oars
in
the
ocean
wide
waste
in
a
few
minutes
the
large
almost
flakes
were
falling
thick
and
fast
hastily
i
put
the
two
kodaks
and
the
treasured
films
into
cases
pocketed
my
only
food
a
handful
of
raisins
adjusted
hatchet
and
barometer
then
started
across
the
strange
snowy
mountains
through
the
night
the
nearest
and
apparently
the
speediest
way
out
lay
across
the
mountains
to
ridgway
the
first
half
of
this
fifteen
miles
was
through
a
rough
section
that
was
new
to
me
after
the
lapse
of
several
years
this
night
expedition
appears
a
serious
one
though
at
the
time
it
gave
me
no
concern
that
i
recall
how
i
ever
managed
to
go
through
that
black
night
without
breaking
my
neck
amid
the
innumerable
opportunities
for
accident
is
a
thing
that
i
can
not
explain
i
descended
a
steep
rugged
slope
for
a
thousand
feet
or
more
with
my
eyes
useless
in
the
eager
falling
of
mingled
rain
and
snow
nothing
could
be
seen
but
despite
slow
careful
going
a
dead
limb
occasionally
prodded
me
with
the
deliberation
of
a
blind
man
i
descended
the
long
steep
broken
slippery
slope
into
the
bottom
of
a
cañon
now
and
then
i
came
out
upon
a
place
here
i
felt
before
and
below
with
a
slender
staff
for
a
place
to
descend
occasionally
no
bottom
could
be
found
and
upon
this
report
i
would
climb
back
a
short
distance
and
search
out
a
way
activity
kept
me
warm
although
the
cold
rain
drenched
me
and
the
slipperiness
of
slopes
and
ledges
never
allowed
me
to
forget
the
law
of
falling
bodies
at
last
a
roaring
torrent
told
me
that
i
was
at
the
bottom
of
a
slope
apparently
i
had
come
down
by
the
very
place
where
the
stream
contracted
and
dashed
into
a
deep
narrow
box
cañon
not
being
able
to
go
down
stream
or
make
a
crossing
at
this
point
i
turned
and
went
up
the
stream
for
half
a
mile
or
so
where
i
crossed
the
swift
roaring
water
in
inky
darkness
on
a
fallen
douglas
spruce
for
such
was
the
arrangement
of
its
limbs
and
the
feel
of
the
wood
in
its
barkless
trunk
that
these
told
me
it
was
a
spruce
though
i
could
see
nothing
during
this
night
journey
i
put
myself
both
in
feeling
and
in
fact
in
a
blind
man
place
the
best
lesson
i
ever
had
to
develop
deliberation
and
keenness
of
touch
the
next
hour
after
crossing
the
stream
i
spent
in
climbing
and
descending
a
low
wooded
ridge
with
smooth
surface
and
gentle
slopes
then
there
was
one
more
river
the
little
cimarron
to
cross
an
engelmann
spruce
with
scaly
flaky
bark
that
had
stood
perfectly
perpendicular
for
a
century
or
two
but
had
recently
been
hurled
to
the
horizontal
provided
a
long
vibrating
bridge
for
me
to
cross
on
once
across
i
started
to
climb
the
most
unstable
mountain
that
i
had
ever
trodden
illustration
near
the
top
of
mt
coxcomb
mt
coxcomb
up
which
i
climbed
is
not
one
of
the
eternal
hills
but
a
crumbling
dissolving
tumbling
transient
mountain
every
hard
rain
dissolves
erodes
and
uncovers
the
sides
of
this
mountain
as
if
it
were
composed
of
sugar
paste
and
stones
it
is
made
up
of
a
confused
mingling
of
parts
and
masses
of
soluble
and
flinty
materials
here
change
and
erosion
run
riot
after
every
rain
there
is
a
great
falling
to
pieces
gravity
the
insatiable
is
temporarily
satisfied
and
the
gulches
feast
on
earthy
materials
while
the
is
glutted
with
crushed
cliffs
acres
of
earth
and
the
débris
of
ruined
forests
here
and
there
these
are
flung
together
in
fierce
confusion
on
this
bit
of
the
wild
world
stage
are
theatrical
lightning
changes
of
scenes
changes
that
on
most
mountains
would
require
ten
thousand
years
or
more
it
is
a
place
of
strange
and
fleeting
landscapes
the
earth
is
ever
changing
like
the
sky
in
wreathed
clouds
a
great
cliff
is
born
stands
out
bold
and
new
in
the
sunshine
and
the
blue
the
storm
king
comes
the
thunders
echo
among
crags
and
cañons
the
broken
clouds
clear
away
and
the
beautiful
bow
bends
above
a
ruined
cliff
here
and
there
strange
immature
monsters
are
struggling
to
rise
to
free
themselves
from
the
earth
occasionally
a
crag
is
brought
forth
full
grown
during
one
operation
of
gravity
erosion
and
storm
and
left
upon
a
foundation
that
would
raise
corn
but
never
sustain
cliff
or
crag
scattered
monoliths
at
times
indulge
in
a
contest
of
leaning
the
farthest
from
the
perpendicular
without
falling
the
foundations
of
these
in
time
give
way
then
gravity
drags
them
head
foremost
or
in
broken
installments
down
the
slope
among
the
forested
slopes
that
i
traversed
there
were
earthy
glaciers
and
leafless
gulches
with
crumbling
walls
some
of
these
gulches
extended
from
bottom
to
top
of
the
mountain
while
others
were
digging
their
way
an
occasional
one
had
a
temporary
ending
against
the
bottom
of
a
kingly
cliff
whose
short
reign
was
about
to
end
as
its
igneous
throne
was
disorganized
and
decomposed
the
storm
and
darkness
continued
as
i
climbed
the
mountain
of
scenes
a
mountain
so
eagerly
moving
from
its
place
in
the
sky
to
a
bed
in
the
sea
the
saturation
had
softened
and
lubricated
the
surface
these
sedimentary
slopes
had
been
made
restless
by
the
rain
i
endeavored
to
follow
up
one
of
the
ridges
but
it
was
narrow
and
all
the
pulpy
places
very
slippery
fearing
to
tumble
off
into
the
dark
unknown
i
climbed
down
into
a
gully
and
up
this
made
my
way
toward
the
top
all
my
mountain
experience
told
me
to
stay
on
the
ridge
and
not
travel
in
darkness
the
way
in
which
gravity
flings
all
his
spoils
the
clouds
were
low
and
i
climbed
well
up
into
them
the
temperature
was
cooler
and
snow
was
whitening
the
earth
when
i
was
well
up
to
the
silver
lining
of
the
clouds
a
gust
of
wind
momentarily
rent
them
and
i
stood
amid
statuary
leaning
monoliths
and
shattered
minarets
all
weird
and
enchanting
in
the
moonlight
a
few
seconds
later
i
was
in
darkness
and
snowstorm
again
the
gulch
steepened
and
apparently
grew
shallower
occasionally
a
mass
of
mud
or
a
few
small
stones
rolled
from
the
sides
of
the
gulch
to
my
feet
and
told
that
saturation
was
at
work
dissolving
and
loosening
anchorages
and
foundations
it
was
time
to
get
out
of
the
gulch
while
i
was
making
haste
to
do
so
there
came
a
sudden
tremor
instantly
followed
by
an
awful
crash
and
roar
then
a
bombardment
of
flying
bounding
plunging
rocks
from
an
overturned
cliff
above
was
raking
my
gulch
nothing
could
be
seen
but
several
slaps
in
the
face
from
dashes
of
snow
which
these
rock
missiles
disturbed
and
displaced
was
expressively
comprehensive
as
this
brief
bombardment
ceased
the
ominous
sounds
from
above
echoing
among
the
cliffs
shouted
warning
of
an
advancing
landslide
this
gave
a
little
zest
to
my
efforts
to
get
out
of
the
gulch
too
much
perhaps
for
my
scramble
ended
in
a
slip
and
a
tumble
back
to
the
bottom
in
the
second
attempt
a
long
uncovered
reached
down
to
me
in
the
darkness
and
with
the
aid
of
this
i
climbed
out
of
the
way
of
the
avalanche
none
too
soon
however
with
quarreling
and
subdued
grinding
sounds
the
rushing
flood
of
landslide
material
went
past
followed
by
an
offensive
smell
while
i
paused
listening
to
the
monster
groan
and
grind
his
way
downward
the
cliffs
fired
a
few
more
rock
missiles
in
my
direction
one
struck
a
crag
beside
me
the
explosive
contact
gave
forth
a
blast
of
sputtering
sparks
and
an
offensive
smell
a
flying
fragment
of
this
shattered
missile
struck
my
left
instep
breaking
one
of
the
small
bones
fortunately
my
foot
was
resting
in
the
mud
when
struck
when
consciousness
came
back
to
me
i
was
lying
in
the
mud
and
snow
drenched
and
cold
the
rain
and
snow
had
almost
ceased
to
fall
and
while
i
was
bandaging
my
foot
the
pale
light
of
day
began
to
show
feebly
through
heavy
clouds
if
that
luminous
place
is
in
the
eastern
horizon
then
i
have
lost
my
sense
of
direction
an
appeal
to
the
compass
brought
no
consolation
for
it
said
laconically
yes
you
are
turned
around
now
even
though
you
never
were
before
the
accuracy
of
the
compass
was
at
once
doubted
but
its
decree
was
followed
slowly
painfully
the
slippery
snowy
steeps
were
scaled
beneath
a
low
gloomy
sky
my
plan
was
to
cross
the
north
shoulder
of
mt
coxcomb
and
then
down
slope
and
gulch
descend
to
the
deeply
filled
alluvium
uncompahgre
valley
and
the
railroad
village
of
ridgway
with
the
summit
only
a
few
feet
above
the
wall
became
so
steep
and
the
hold
so
insecure
that
it
appeared
best
to
turn
back
lest
i
be
precipitated
from
the
cliff
the
small
hard
points
in
the
sedimentary
wall
had
been
loosened
in
their
settings
by
the
rain
climbing
this
wall
with
two
good
feet
in
a
dry
time
would
be
adventurous
pastime
while
i
was
flattened
against
the
wall
descending
with
greatest
caution
there
came
a
roaring
crash
together
with
a
trembling
of
earth
and
air
an
enormous
section
of
the
opposite
side
of
the
mass
that
i
was
on
had
fallen
away
and
the
oscillations
of
the
cliff
nearly
hurled
me
to
the
rock
wreckage
at
the
bottom
of
the
wall
on
safe
footing
at
last
i
followed
along
the
bottom
of
the
summit
cliff
and
encountered
the
place
from
which
the
rocks
had
been
hurled
at
me
in
the
darkness
and
where
a
cliff
had
fallen
to
start
the
slide
it
was
evident
that
the
storm
waters
had
wrecked
the
foundation
of
the
cliff
ridges
and
gullies
of
the
bad
land
type
fluted
the
slope
and
prevented
my
traveling
along
close
to
the
summit
at
right
angles
to
the
slope
there
appeared
no
course
for
me
but
to
descend
to
the
little
cimarron
river
hours
were
required
for
less
than
two
miles
of
painful
though
intensely
interesting
travel
it
was
a
day
of
landslides
just
as
there
are
in
the
heights
days
of
snow
slides
this
excessive
saturation
after
months
of
drought
left
cohesion
and
adhesion
but
slight
hold
on
these
strange
sedimentary
mixtures
the
surface
tore
loose
and
crawled
cliffs
tumbled
after
counting
the
crash
and
echoing
roar
of
fallen
cliffs
i
ceased
counting
and
gave
more
attention
to
other
demonstrations
on
the
steeps
numerous
fleshy
areas
crawled
slipped
and
crept
the
front
of
a
long
one
had
brought
up
against
a
rock
ledge
while
the
blind
rear
of
the
mass
pressed
powerfully
forward
crumpling
folding
and
piling
the
front
part
against
the
ledge
at
one
place
an
enormous
rocky
buttress
had
tumbled
over
below
the
largest
piece
of
this
a
wreck
in
a
mass
of
mud
floated
slowly
down
the
slope
in
a
shallow
moderately
tilted
gulch
this
buttress
had
been
something
of
an
impounding
retaining
wall
against
which
loosened
materials
had
accumulated
into
a
terrace
the
terrace
had
long
been
adorned
with
a
cluster
of
tall
spruces
whose
presence
produced
vegetable
mould
and
improved
soil
conditions
on
the
of
this
buttress
the
terrace
commenced
to
sag
and
settle
the
débris
was
well
roped
together
and
reinforced
with
when
i
came
along
these
tall
trees
so
long
bravely
erect
were
leaning
drooping
forward
their
entire
foundation
had
slipped
several
feet
and
was
steadily
crowding
out
over
the
pit
from
which
gravity
had
dragged
the
buttress
the
trees
with
their
roots
wedged
in
crevices
were
anchored
to
and
clinging
on
for
dear
life
now
and
then
a
low
thudding
sound
told
of
strained
or
ruptured
roots
the
foundation
steadily
gave
way
while
the
trees
drooped
dangerously
forward
united
on
the
heights
the
brave
trees
had
struggled
through
the
seasons
and
united
they
would
go
down
together
they
had
fixed
and
fertilized
the
spoil
from
the
slopes
above
this
spoil
had
been
held
and
made
to
produce
and
prevented
from
going
down
to
clog
the
channel
of
the
little
cimarron
or
making
with
the
waters
the
long
sifting
shifting
journey
joining
at
last
the
lifeless
soil
deposits
in
the
delta
tongues
of
the
colorado
but
the
steadfast
trees
with
all
their
power
to
check
erosion
and
create
soil
were
to
fall
before
the
overwhelming
elements
farther
and
farther
the
unsupported
and
foundation
slipped
more
and
more
the
trees
leaned
and
drooped
forward
until
gravity
tore
all
loose
and
plunged
the
trees
head
foremost
into
the
pit
crushing
down
upon
tumbled
tons
of
rocks
soil
matted
mud
and
roots
all
the
wreckage
of
the
terrace
the
slide
that
narrowly
missed
me
in
the
night
was
a
monster
one
and
grew
in
magnitude
as
it
brutally
rooted
and
gouged
its
way
downward
after
descending
more
than
half
a
mile
it
struck
an
enormous
dome
rock
which
stayed
a
small
part
of
it
while
the
remainder
deflected
made
an
awesome
plunge
and
engulfed
a
small
circular
grove
in
an
easily
sloping
grassy
plot
most
of
the
towering
spruces
were
thrown
down
and
deeply
buried
beneath
mud
smashed
cliffs
and
the
mangled
forms
of
trees
from
up
the
slope
a
few
trees
on
the
margin
of
the
grove
were
left
standing
but
they
suffered
from
cruel
bruises
and
badly
torn
bark
on
the
farther
side
of
the
grove
a
number
of
the
trees
were
bent
forward
but
only
partly
buried
with
heads
and
shoulders
out
they
were
struggling
to
extricate
themselves
and
now
and
then
one
shook
an
arm
free
from
the
débris
over
the
place
where
a
few
hours
before
tall
tree
plumes
had
stood
in
the
sky
a
fierce
confusion
of
slide
wreckage
settled
and
tumbled
to
pieces
while
the
buried
and
trees
whispered
murmured
and
sighed
as
they
struggled
to
rise
out
with
nature
trees
are
supposed
to
stand
in
one
place
all
their
lives
but
one
of
the
most
interesting
movements
of
this
elemental
day
was
the
transplanting
by
gravity
of
an
entire
clump
of
tall
old
firs
water
released
these
trees
and
they
appeared
to
enjoy
being
dragged
by
gravity
to
a
new
home
and
setting
i
was
resting
my
foot
and
watching
a
gigantic
monolithic
stone
settle
and
come
down
gracefully
when
a
on
the
skyline
just
beyond
appeared
to
move
forward
several
yards
then
make
a
stop
while
i
was
trying
to
decide
whether
they
really
had
moved
or
not
they
moved
forward
again
with
all
their
earthly
claims
a
few
square
rods
of
surface
together
with
their
foundations
beneath
with
all
tops
merrily
erect
they
slid
forward
swerving
right
and
left
along
the
line
of
least
resistance
and
finally
came
to
rest
in
a
small
unclaimed
flat
in
which
no
doubt
they
grew
up
with
the
country
the
slides
of
that
weird
day
showed
a
change
of
position
varying
from
a
few
feet
to
a
mile
several
ploughed
out
into
the
little
cimarron
and
piled
its
channel
more
than
full
of
spoils
from
the
slopes
through
this
the
river
fought
its
way
and
from
it
the
waters
flowed
richly
laden
with
earthy
matter
the
great
changes
which
took
place
on
mt
coxcomb
in
a
few
hours
were
more
marked
and
extensive
than
the
alterations
in
most
mountains
since
the
sphinx
began
to
watch
the
shifting
changing
sands
by
the
nile
by
the
air
grew
colder
and
the
snow
commenced
to
deepen
upon
the
earth
bedraggled
and
limping
i
made
slow
progress
down
the
slope
just
at
twilight
a
mother
bear
and
her
two
cubs
met
me
they
probably
were
climbing
up
to
i
stood
still
to
let
them
pass
when
a
few
yards
distant
the
bear
rose
up
and
looked
at
me
with
a
combination
of
curiosity
astonishment
and
perhaps
contempt
with
woof
more
in
a
tone
of
disgust
than
of
fear
or
anger
she
rushed
off
followed
by
the
cubs
and
the
three
disappeared
in
the
darkening
forest
aisles
the
trees
were
and
dripping
but
on
and
on
i
went
years
of
training
had
given
me
great
physical
endurance
and
this
along
with
a
peculiar
mental
attitude
that
nature
had
developed
in
me
from
being
alone
in
her
wild
places
at
all
seasons
gave
me
a
rare
trust
in
her
and
an
enthusiastic
though
unconscious
confidence
in
the
ultimate
success
of
whatever
i
attempted
to
accomplish
out
of
doors
about
two
in
the
morning
i
at
last
descended
to
the
river
the
fresh
débris
on
my
side
of
the
stream
so
hampered
traveling
that
it
became
necessary
to
cross
not
finding
any
bridge
i
started
to
wade
across
in
a
wide
place
that
i
supposed
to
be
shallow
midway
and
in
the
swift
water
i
struck
the
injured
foot
against
a
boulder
momentarily
flinching
and
the
current
swirled
me
off
my
feet
after
much
struggling
and
battling
with
the
turbulent
waters
i
succeeded
in
reaching
the
opposite
shore
this
immersion
did
not
make
me
any
wetter
than
i
was
or
than
i
had
been
for
hours
but
the
water
chilled
me
so
i
hurried
forward
as
rapidly
as
possible
to
warm
up
after
a
few
steps
the
injured
leg
suddenly
became
helpless
and
i
tumbled
down
in
the
snow
unable
to
revive
the
leg
promptly
and
being
very
cold
from
my
experience
i
endeavored
to
start
a
fire
everything
was
soaked
and
the
snow
was
falling
and
the
trees
dripping
water
i
groped
about
on
my
hands
and
one
knee
dragging
the
paralyzed
leg
all
these
disadvantages
along
with
chattering
teeth
and
numb
fingers
made
my
attempts
a
series
of
failures
that
night
of
raw
primitive
life
is
worse
in
retrospect
than
was
the
real
one
still
i
was
deadly
in
earnest
at
the
time
hours
of
alertness
and
activity
in
the
wilds
swimming
and
wading
a
torrent
of
at
two
in
the
morning
tumbling
out
into
the
wet
snowy
wilds
miles
from
food
and
shelter
a
crushed
foot
and
a
helpless
leg
the
penetrating
clinging
cold
and
no
fire
is
going
back
to
nature
about
ten
thousand
years
farther
than
it
is
desirable
to
go
but
i
was
not
discouraged
even
for
a
moment
and
it
did
not
occur
to
me
to
complain
though
as
i
look
back
now
the
theory
of
appears
to
have
been
carried
a
trifle
too
far
at
last
the
fire
blazed
after
two
hours
beside
it
i
went
down
the
river
greatly
improved
the
snow
was
about
fifteen
inches
deep
illustration
rock
shortly
before
daylight
i
felt
that
i
was
close
to
a
trail
i
had
traveled
one
that
came
to
cimarron
near
by
rock
recrossing
the
river
on
a
fallen
log
i
lay
down
to
sleep
beneath
a
shelving
rock
with
a
roaring
fire
before
me
sleeping
soundly
and
deeply
until
the
crash
of
an
overturned
cliff
awakened
me
jumping
to
my
feet
i
found
the
storm
over
with
the
clouds
broken
and
drifting
back
and
forth
in
two
strata
as
though
undecided
whether
to
go
or
remain
above
a
low
lazy
cloud
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
and
turning
beheld
rock
the
foot
gave
no
pain
as
i
limped
along
the
trail
i
had
so
often
followed
now
and
then
i
turned
to
take
a
photograph
the
stars
and
the
lights
in
the
village
were
just
appearing
when
i
limped
into
the
surgeon
office
in
ridgway
the
maker
of
scenery
and
soil
the
maker
of
scenery
and
soil
during
my
first
boyish
exploring
trip
in
the
rocky
mountains
i
was
impressed
with
the
stupendous
changes
which
the
upper
slope
of
these
mountains
had
undergone
in
places
were
immense
embankments
and
wild
deltas
of
débris
that
plainly
had
come
from
elsewhere
in
other
places
the
rough
edges
of
the
cañons
and
ridges
had
been
trimmed
and
polished
their
cliffs
and
projections
were
gone
and
their
surfaces
had
been
swept
clean
of
all
loose
material
later
i
tried
vainly
to
account
for
some
cañon
walls
being
trimmed
and
polished
at
the
bottom
while
their
upper
parts
were
jagged
in
most
cañons
the
height
of
the
polishings
above
the
bottom
was
equal
on
both
walls
with
the
upper
edge
of
the
polish
even
or
level
for
the
entire
length
of
the
cañon
in
one
cañon
in
both
floor
and
walls
were
deep
lateral
scratches
in
the
rocks
one
day
i
found
some
polished
boulders
perched
like
driftwood
on
the
top
of
a
polished
rock
dome
they
were
porphyry
while
the
dome
was
flawless
granite
they
plainly
had
come
from
somewhere
else
how
they
managed
to
be
where
they
were
was
too
much
for
me
mountain
floods
were
terrible
but
not
wild
enough
in
their
fiercest
rushes
to
do
this
upon
a
mountainside
across
a
gorge
about
two
miles
distant
and
a
thousand
feet
above
the
perched
boulders
on
the
dome
i
found
a
porphyry
outcrop
but
this
situation
only
added
to
my
confusion
i
did
not
then
know
of
the
glacial
period
or
the
actions
of
glaciers
it
was
a
delightful
revelation
when
john
muir
told
me
of
these
wonders
much
of
the
earth
surface
together
with
most
have
gone
through
a
glacial
period
or
periods
there
is
extensive
and
varied
evidence
that
the
greater
portion
of
the
earth
has
been
carved
and
extensively
changed
by
the
ice
king
substantial
works
blurred
and
broken
records
and
impressive
ruins
in
wide
array
over
the
earth
show
long
and
active
possession
by
the
ice
king
as
eloquently
as
the
monumental
ruins
in
the
seven
hills
tell
of
their
intense
association
with
man
both
the
northern
and
the
southern
hemispheres
have
had
their
heavy
floods
of
ice
that
appear
to
have
swept
from
the
polar
world
far
toward
the
equator
during
the
great
glacial
period
which
may
have
lasted
for
ages
a
mountainous
flood
of
ice
overspread
america
from
the
north
and
extended
far
down
the
mississippi
valley
this
ice
may
have
been
a
mile
or
more
in
depth
it
utterly
changed
the
topography
and
made
a
new
earth
lakes
were
filled
and
new
ones
made
new
landscapes
were
formed
mountains
were
rubbed
down
to
plains
morainal
hills
were
built
upon
plains
and
streams
were
moved
bodily
it
is
probable
that
during
the
last
ice
age
the
location
and
course
of
both
the
ohio
and
the
missouri
rivers
were
changed
originally
the
missouri
flowed
east
and
north
probably
emptying
into
a
lake
that
had
possession
of
the
lake
superior
territory
the
ice
king
deliberately
shoved
this
river
hundreds
of
miles
toward
the
south
the
ohio
probably
had
a
similar
experience
these
rivers
appear
to
mark
the
farthest
south
of
the
ice
their
position
probably
was
determined
by
the
ice
had
a
line
been
traced
on
the
map
along
the
ragged
edge
and
front
of
the
glacier
at
its
maximum
extension
this
line
would
almost
answer
for
the
present
position
of
the
missouri
and
ohio
rivers
the
most
suggestive
and
revealing
words
concerning
glaciers
that
i
have
ever
read
are
these
of
john
muir
in
the
mountains
of
california
when
we
bear
in
mind
that
all
the
sierra
forests
are
young
growing
upon
moraine
soil
recently
deposited
and
that
the
flank
of
the
range
itself
with
all
its
landscapes
is
recently
sculptured
and
brought
to
light
of
day
from
beneath
the
ice
mantle
of
the
glacial
winter
then
a
thousand
lawless
mysteries
disappear
and
broad
harmonies
take
their
places
a
glacier
says
judge
junius
henderson
in
the
best
definition
that
i
have
heard
is
a
body
of
ice
originating
in
an
area
where
the
annual
accumulation
of
snow
exceeds
the
dissipation
and
moving
downward
and
outward
to
an
area
where
dissipation
exceeds
accumulation
illustration
the
hallett
glacier
a
glacier
may
move
forward
only
a
few
feet
in
a
year
or
it
may
move
several
feet
in
a
day
it
may
be
only
a
few
hundred
feet
in
length
or
as
during
the
ice
age
have
an
area
of
thousands
of
square
miles
the
arapahoe
glacier
moves
slowly
as
do
all
small
glaciers
and
some
large
ones
one
year
measured
movement
was
feet
near
the
centre
and
near
the
edge
this
too
is
about
the
average
for
one
year
and
also
an
approximate
movement
for
most
small
mountain
glaciers
the
centre
of
the
glacier
meeting
less
resistance
than
the
edges
commonly
flows
much
more
rapidly
the
enormous
alaskan
glaciers
have
a
much
more
rapid
flow
many
moving
forward
five
or
more
feet
a
day
a
glacier
is
the
greatest
of
eroding
agents
it
wears
away
the
surface
over
which
it
flows
it
grinds
mountains
to
dust
transports
soil
and
boulders
scoops
out
gives
flowing
lines
to
landscapes
beyond
comprehension
we
are
indebted
to
them
for
scenery
and
soil
glaciers
or
ice
rivers
make
vast
changes
those
in
the
rocky
mountains
overthrew
cliffs
pinnacles
and
rocky
headlands
these
in
part
were
crushed
and
in
part
they
became
embedded
in
the
front
bottom
and
sides
of
the
ice
this
front
tore
into
the
sides
and
bottom
of
its
channel
after
it
had
made
a
channel
with
a
terrible
rasping
crushing
and
grinding
effect
forced
irresistibly
forward
by
a
pressure
of
untold
millions
of
tons
glaciers
large
and
small
the
world
over
have
like
characteristics
and
influences
to
know
one
glacier
will
enable
one
to
enjoy
glaciers
everywhere
and
to
appreciate
the
stupendous
influence
they
have
had
upon
the
surface
of
the
earth
they
have
planed
down
the
surface
and
even
reduced
to
turtle
outlines
in
places
the
nose
of
the
glacier
was
thrust
with
such
enormous
pressure
against
a
mountainside
that
the
ice
was
forced
up
the
slope
which
it
flowed
across
and
then
descended
on
the
opposite
side
sustained
by
constant
and
measureless
pressure
years
of
fearful
and
incessant
application
of
this
weighty
flowing
planing
ploughing
sandpaper
wore
the
mountain
down
in
time
too
the
small
ravines
became
widened
deepened
and
extended
into
enormous
glaciated
gorges
glaciers
have
gouged
or
scooped
many
basins
in
the
solid
rock
these
commonly
are
made
at
the
bottom
of
a
deep
slope
where
the
descending
ice
bore
heavily
on
the
lever
or
against
a
reverse
incline
the
size
of
the
basin
thus
made
is
determined
by
the
size
width
and
weight
of
the
glacier
and
by
other
factors
in
the
rocky
mountains
these
excavations
vary
in
size
from
a
few
acres
to
a
few
thousand
they
became
on
the
disappearance
of
the
ice
more
than
a
thousand
lakes
of
glacial
origin
dot
the
upper
portions
of
the
rocky
mountains
of
colorado
most
of
these
are
above
the
altitude
of
nine
thousand
feet
and
the
largest
grand
lake
is
three
miles
in
length
landslides
and
silt
have
filled
many
of
the
old
glacier
lake
basins
and
these
overgrown
with
grass
and
sedge
are
called
glacier
meadows
vast
was
the
quantity
of
material
picked
up
and
transported
by
these
glaciers
mountains
were
moved
piecemeal
and
ground
to
boulders
pebbles
and
in
the
moving
in
addition
to
the
material
which
the
glacier
gathered
up
and
excavated
it
also
carried
the
wreckage
brought
down
by
landslides
and
the
eroded
matter
poured
upon
it
by
streams
from
the
heights
most
of
the
material
which
falls
upon
the
top
of
the
upper
end
of
the
glacier
ultimately
works
its
way
to
the
bottom
where
with
the
other
gathered
material
it
is
pressed
against
the
bottom
and
sides
and
used
as
a
cutting
or
grinding
tool
until
worn
to
a
powder
or
pebbles
of
débris
often
accumulate
upon
the
top
of
the
glacier
on
the
lower
course
this
often
is
a
hundred
feet
or
more
above
the
surface
and
as
the
glacier
descends
and
shrivels
enormous
quantities
of
this
rocky
débris
fall
off
the
sides
and
in
places
form
enormous
embankments
these
often
closely
parallel
long
stretches
of
the
glacier
like
river
levees
the
large
remainder
of
the
material
is
carried
to
the
end
of
the
glacier
where
the
melting
ice
unloads
and
releases
it
this
accumulation
which
corresponds
to
the
delta
of
a
river
is
the
terminal
moraine
for
years
the
bulk
of
the
ice
may
melt
away
at
about
the
same
place
this
accumulates
an
enormous
amount
of
débris
an
advance
of
the
ice
may
plough
through
this
and
repile
it
or
the
retreat
of
the
ice
or
a
changed
direction
of
its
flow
may
pile
the
débris
elsewhere
and
over
wide
areas
many
of
these
terminal
moraines
are
an
array
of
broken
embankments
small
holes
and
smooth
level
spaces
the
débris
of
these
moraines
embraces
gravel
pebbles
a
few
angular
and
enormous
quantities
of
boulders
rocks
rounded
by
the
grind
of
the
glacial
mill
strange
freight
of
unknown
age
these
creeping
ice
rivers
bring
down
one
season
the
frozen
carcass
of
a
mountain
sheep
was
taken
from
the
ice
at
the
end
of
the
arapahoe
glacier
if
this
sheep
fell
into
a
crevasse
at
the
upper
end
of
the
glacier
its
carcass
probably
had
been
in
the
ice
for
more
than
a
century
human
victims
too
have
been
strangely
handled
by
glaciers
it
appears
that
in
hamil
and
a
party
of
climbers
were
struck
by
a
snowslide
on
the
slope
of
mont
blanc
one
escaped
with
his
life
while
the
others
were
swept
down
into
a
crevasse
and
buried
so
deeply
in
the
snow
and
ice
that
their
bodies
could
not
be
recovered
scientists
said
that
at
the
rate
the
glacier
was
moving
it
would
give
up
its
dead
after
forty
years
far
down
the
mountain
years
afterward
the
ice
gave
up
its
victims
a
writer
has
founded
on
this
incident
an
interesting
story
in
which
the
bodies
are
recovered
in
an
excellent
state
of
preservation
and
an
old
woman
with
sunken
cheeks
and
gray
hair
clasps
the
youthful
body
of
her
lover
of
long
ago
the
guide
where
morainal
débris
covers
thousands
of
acres
it
is
probable
that
valuable
mineral
veins
were
in
some
cases
covered
prospecting
prevented
and
mineral
wealth
lost
but
on
the
other
hand
the
erosion
done
by
the
glacier
often
cutting
down
several
hundred
feet
has
in
many
cases
uncovered
leads
which
otherwise
probably
would
have
been
left
buried
beyond
search
then
too
millions
of
dollars
of
placer
gold
have
been
washed
from
moraines
in
addition
to
the
work
of
making
and
giving
the
mountains
flowing
lines
of
beauty
the
glaciers
added
inconceivably
to
the
richness
of
the
earth
resources
by
creating
vast
estates
of
soil
it
is
probable
that
glaciers
have
supplied
one
half
of
the
productive
areas
of
the
earth
with
soil
the
mills
of
the
glaciers
have
ground
as
much
soil
for
the
earth
as
wind
frost
heat
and
rain
all
the
weathering
forces
this
flour
and
other
coarser
glacial
grindings
were
quickly
changed
by
the
chemistry
of
nature
into
the
staff
of
life
for
forests
and
flowers
glaciers
have
not
only
ground
the
soil
but
in
many
places
have
carried
this
and
spread
it
out
hundreds
of
miles
from
the
place
where
the
original
raw
rocks
were
obtained
wind
and
water
have
done
an
enormous
amount
of
work
sorting
out
the
soil
in
moraines
and
leaving
the
boulders
behind
this
soil
was
scattered
and
sifted
far
and
wide
to
feed
the
hungry
at
last
the
glacial
winter
ended
and
each
year
more
snow
melted
and
evaporated
than
fell
retreated
up
the
slopes
and
finally
became
broken
even
in
the
heights
in
the
rockies
there
are
only
a
dozen
or
so
small
glaciers
mere
fragments
of
the
once
great
ice
cap
which
originally
covered
deeply
all
the
higher
places
and
slopes
and
extended
unbroken
for
hundreds
of
miles
pierced
strangely
with
a
few
sharp
peaks
the
small
remaining
glaciers
in
the
rocky
mountains
lie
in
sheltered
basins
or
cirques
in
the
summits
and
mostly
above
the
altitude
of
thirteen
thousand
feet
these
are
built
and
supplied
by
the
winds
which
carry
and
sweep
snow
to
them
from
off
thousands
of
acres
of
treeless
barren
summits
the
present
climate
of
these
mountains
is
very
different
from
what
it
was
ages
ago
then
for
a
time
the
annual
snowfall
was
extremely
heavy
each
year
the
sun
and
the
wind
removed
only
a
part
of
the
snow
which
fell
during
the
year
this
icy
remainder
was
added
to
the
of
preceding
years
until
the
accumulation
was
of
vast
depth
and
weight
on
the
summit
slopes
this
snow
appears
to
have
been
from
a
few
hundred
to
a
few
thousand
feet
deep
softened
from
the
saturation
of
melting
and
compressed
from
its
own
weight
it
became
a
stratum
of
ice
this
overlay
the
summit
of
the
main
ranges
and
was
pierced
by
only
a
few
of
the
higher
sharper
peaks
which
were
sufficiently
steep
to
be
stripped
of
snow
by
snowslides
and
the
wind
the
weight
of
this
superimposed
icy
stratum
was
immense
it
was
greater
than
the
bottom
layers
could
support
ice
is
plastic
rubbery
if
sufficient
pressure
or
weight
be
applied
under
the
enormous
pressure
the
bottom
layers
started
to
crawl
or
flow
from
beneath
like
squeezed
dough
this
forced
mass
moved
outward
and
downward
in
the
direction
of
the
least
resistance
down
the
slope
thus
a
glacier
is
conceived
and
born
numbers
of
these
glaciers
immense
serpents
and
tongues
of
ice
extended
down
the
slopes
in
places
miles
beyond
the
line
of
perpetual
snow
some
of
these
were
miles
in
length
a
thousand
or
more
feet
wide
and
hundreds
of
feet
deep
and
they
forced
and
crushed
their
way
irresistibly
it
is
probable
they
had
a
sustained
continuous
flow
for
centuries
a
glacier
is
one
of
the
natural
wonders
of
the
world
and
well
might
every
one
pay
a
visit
to
one
of
these
great
the
time
to
visit
a
glacier
is
during
late
summer
when
the
snows
of
the
preceding
winter
are
most
completely
removed
from
the
surface
with
the
snows
removed
the
beauty
of
the
ice
and
its
almost
stratified
are
revealed
the
snow
too
conceals

without

concealed
crevasses

are

it

within
a

of
a

is

to
all
the

in

one
may

one
may
see
or

these

are
caused
by
the

flowing
over

may

one
may
see

and
the

deposited
by
the

in
its

days
times
when
the

almost
conquered
the

in

the
soil
and

were
transported
only
a
few
miles
while
the

most
of

thus
the

remarks
concerning

he
said
if

adds
to

delight
of

of

one
vision
may
be
extended
past
the

down
through

soul
is
uplifted

attuned
into
fuller
accord
with
the

of
which

then
mountaineering
becomes
not
a
pastime
but
an
inspiration
a
rainy
day
at
the
stream
source
a
rainy
day
at
the
stream
source
to
spend
a
day
in
the
rain
at
the
source
of
a
stream
was
an
experience
i
had
long
desired
for
the
behavior
of
the
waters
in
collecting
and
hurrying
down
slopes
would
doubtless
show
some
of
nature
interesting
ways
on
the
rockies
no
spot
seemed
quite
so
promising
as
the
watershed
on
which
the
vrain
made
its
start
to
the
sea
this
had
steep
and
moderate
slopes
rock
ledges
and
deep
soil
and
about
one
half
of
its
five
thousand
acres
was
covered
with
primeval
forest
while
the
remainder
had
been
burned
almost
to
barrenness
by
a
fierce
forest
fire
here
were
varied
and
contrasting
conditions
to
give
many
moods
to
the
waters
and
all
this
display
could
easily
be
seen
during
one
active
day
june
was
the
month
chosen
since
in
the
region
of
the
vrain
that
is
the
rainiest
part
of
the
year
after
thoroughly
exploring
the
ground
i
concluded
to
go
down
the
river
a
few
miles
and
make
headquarters
in
a
new
sawmill
there
i
spent
delightful
days
in
gathering
information
concerning
and
in
making
biographical
studies
of
several
veteran
logs
as
the
saw
ripped
open
and
revealed
their
one
morning
i
was
awakened
by
the
pelting
and
thumping
of
large
widely
scattered
raindrops
on
the
roof
of
the
mill
tree
stories
were
forgotten
and
i
rushed
outdoors
the
sky
was
filled
with
the
structureless
gloom
of
and
the
heavy
calm
air
suggested
rain
we
get
a
wetting
such
as
you
read
of
declared
the
sawmill
foreman
as
i
made
haste
to
start
for
the
wilds
i
plunged
into
the
woods
and
went
eagerly
up
the
dim
steep
mountain
trail
which
kept
close
company
with
the
river
vrain
any
doubts
concerning
the
strength
of
the
storm
were
quickly
washed
away
my
clothes
were
swiftly
soaked
but
with
notebook
safe
under
my
hat
i
hastened
to
gain
the
forks
as
soon
as
possible
enjoying
the
general
downpour
and
the
softened
noise
that
it
made
through
the
woods
i
had
often
been
out
in
rains
on
the
rockies
but
this
one
was
wetting
the
earth
with
less
effort
than
any
i
had
ever
experienced
for
half
an
hour
no
air
stirred
then
while
crossing
a
small
irregular
opening
in
the
woods
i
was
caught
in
a
of
wrangling
winds
and
waters
and
now
and
then
their
weight
would
almost
knock
me
over
until
like
a
sapling
i
bowed
streaming
in
the
storm
the
air
was
full
of
and
once
across
the
open
i
made
haste
to
hug
a
tree
hoping
to
find
a
breath
of
air
that
was
not
saturated
to
strangulation
neither
bird
nor
beast
had
been
seen
nor
did
i
expect
to
come
upon
any
unless
by
chance
my
movements
drove
one
from
its
refuge
but
while
i
sat
on
a
sodden
log
reveling
in
elemental
moods
and
sounds
a
came
flying
along
he
alighted
on
a
boulder
which
the
stream
at
my
feet
seemed
determined
to
drown
or
dislodge
and
making
his
usual
courtesies
he
began
to
sing
his
melody
is
penetrating
but
so
sustained
was
the
combined
roar
of
the
stream
and
the
storm
that
there
came
to
me
only
a
few
notes
of
his
energetic
song
his
expressive
attitudes
and
gestures
were
so
harmoniously
united
with
these
however
that
i
could
not
help
feeling
that
he
was
singing
with
all
his
might
to
the
water
the
woods
and
me
keeping
close
to
the
stream
i
continued
my
climb
my
ear
now
caught
the
feeble
note
of
a
robin
who
was
making
discouraged
and
disconsolate
efforts
at
song
and
it
seemed
to
issue
from
a
throat
clogged
with
wet
cotton
plainly
the
world
was
not
beautiful
to
him
and
the
attempt
at
music
was
made
to
kill
time
or
cheer
himself
up
the
robin
and
the
ouzel
how
i
love
them
both
and
yet
how
utterly
unlike
they
are
the
former
usually
chooses
so
poor
a
anchors
its
nest
so
carelessly
or
builds
so
clumsily
that
the
precious
contents
are
often
spilled
or
the
nest
discovered
by
some
enemy
his
mental
is
such
that
he
is
prone
to
predict
the
worst
possible
outcome
of
any
new
situation
the
ouzel
on
the
other
hand
is
sweet
and
serene
he
builds
his
nest
upon
a
rock
and
tucks
it
where
search
and
sharp
eyes
may
not
find
it
he
appears
indifferent
to
the
comings
and
goings
of
beast
or
man
enjoys
all
weathers
seems
entranced
with
life
and
may
sing
every
day
of
the
year
up
in
the
lower
margin
of
the
engelmann
spruce
forest
the
wind
now
ceased
and
the
clouds
began
to
conserve
their
waters
the
territory
which
i
was
about
to
explore
is
on
the
eastern
summit
slopes
of
the
rockies
between
the
altitudes
of
hundred
and
twelve
thousand
feet
most
of
these
slopes
were
steep
and
much
of
the
soil
had
a
basis
of
disintegrated
granite
the
forested
and
the
treeless
slopes
had
approximately
equal
areas
and
were
much
alike
in
regard
to
soil
inclination
and
altitude
while
the
verdure
of
both
areas
before
the
forest
fire
had
been
almost
identical
the
vrain
is
formed
by
two
branches
flowing
northeasterly
and
southeasterly
the
former
draining
the
treeless
area
and
the
latter
the
forested
one
below
the
junction
the
united
waters
sweep
away
through
the
woods
but
at
it
and
a
short
distance
above
the
fire
had
destroyed
every
living
thing
at
the
forks
i
found
many
things
of
interest
the
branch
with
dark
waters
from
the
barren
slopes
was
already
swollen
to
many
times
its
normal
volume
and
was
thick
with
sediment
from
the
region
the
stream
with
white
waters
from
the
forest
had
risen
just
a
trifle
and
there
was
only
a
slight
stain
visible
these
noticeable
changes
were
produced
by
an
hour
of
rain
i
dipped
several
canfuls
from
the
deforested
drainage
fork
and
after
each
had
stood
half
a
minute
the
water
was
poured
off
the
average
quantity
of
sediment
remaining
was
one
fifth
of
a
canful
while
the
white
water
from
the
forested
slope
deposited
only
a
thin
layer
on
the
bottom
of
the
can
it
was
evident
that
the
forest
was
absorbing
and
delaying
the
water
clinging
to
its
soil
and
sediment
in
fact
both
streams
carried
so
much
suggestive
and
alluring
news
concerning
storm
effects
on
the
slopes
above
that
i
determined
to
hasten
on
in
order
to
climb
over
and
watch
them
while
they
were
dashed
and
drenched
with
rain
illustration
among
the

continental
divide
near
long
peak
planning
to
return
and
give
more
attention
to
the
waters
of
both
branches
at
this
place
i
started
to
inspect
first
the
forested
sides
the
lower
of
these
slopes
were
tilted
with
a
twenty
to
per
cent
grade
and
covered
with
a
primeval
engelmann
spruce
forest
of
tall
crowding
trees
the
age
of
which
as
i
had
learned
during
previous
visits
was
only
a
few
years
less
than
two
centuries
the
forest
floor
was
covered
with
a
thick
carpet
of
litter
one
which
the
years
had
woven
out
of
the
wreckage
of
limbs
and
leaves
this
though
loosely
coarsely
woven
has
a
firm
feeling
when
trodden
during
dry
weather
however
the
forest
floor
seemed
recently
upholstered
it
is
absorbent
hence
the
water
had
filled
the
interstices
and
given
elasticity
i
cleared
away
some
of
this
litter
and
found
that
it
had
an
average
depth
of
fifteen
inches
the
upper
third
lay
loosely
but
below
it
the
weave
was
more
compact
and
much
finer
than
that
on
or
near
the
surface
i
judged
that
two
inches
of
rain
had
fallen
and
had
soaked
to
an
average
depth
of
eight
inches
it
was
interesting
to
watch
the
water
ooze
from
the
broken
walls
of
this
litter
or
humus
on
the
upper
sides
of
the
holes
which
i
dug
down
into
it
one
of
these
was
close
to
a
bare
tilted
slope
of
granite
as
i
stood
watching
the
water
slowly
dripping
from
the
broken
humus
and
rapidly
racing
down
the
rocks
the
thought
came
to
me
that
with
the
same
difference
in
speed
the
from
the
deforested
land
might
be
breaking
through
the
levees
at
new
orleans
before
the
water
from
these
woods
escaped
and
got
down
as
far
as
the
sawmill
the
forest
might
well
proclaim
as
long
as
i
stand
my
countless
roots
shall
clutch
and
clasp
the
soil
like
eagles
claws
and
hold
it
on
these
slopes
i
shall
add
to
this
soil
by
annually
creating
more
i
shall
heave
it
with
my
growing
roots
loosen
and
cover
it
with
litter
rugs
and
maintain
a
porous
sievelike
surface
that
will
catch
the
rain
and
so
delay
and
distribute
these
waters
that
at
the
foot
of
my
slope
perennial
springs
will
ever
flow
quietly
toward
the
sea
destroy
me
and
on
stormy
days
the
waters
may
wash
away
the
unanchored
soil
as
they
run
unresisted
down
the
slopes
to
form
a
black
destructive
flood
in
the
valley
below
the
summit
of
the
forested
slope
was
comparatively
smooth
where
i
gained
it
and
contained
a
few
small
grassy
spaces
among
its
spruces
and
firs
the
wind
was
blowing
and
the
low
clouds
pressed
hurried
along
the
ground
whirled
through
the
grassy
places
and
were
driven
and
dragged
swiftly
among
the
trees
i
was
in
the
lower
margin
of
cloud
and
it
was
like
a
wet
gray
night
nothing
could
be
seen
clearly
even
at
a
few
feet
and
every
breath
i
took
was
like
swallowing
a
saturated
sponge
these
conditions
did
not
last
long
for
a
completely
rent
the
clouds
and
gave
me
a
glimpse
of
the
blue
sky
i
hurried
along
the
ascending
trend
of
the
ridge
hoping
to
get
above
the
clouds
but
they
kept
rising
and
after
i
had
traveled
half
a
mile
or
more
i
gave
it
up
presently
i
was
impressed
with
the
height
of
an
exceptionally
tall
spruce
that
stood
in
the
centre
of
a
group
of
its
companions
at
once
i
decided
to
climb
it
and
have
a
look
over
the
country
and
cloud
from
its
swaying
top
when
half
way
up
the
swift
manner
in
which
the
tree
was
tracing
seismographic
lines
through
the
air
awakened
my
interest
in
the
trunk
that
was
holding
me
was
it
sound
or
not
at
the
foot
appearances
gave
it
good
standing
the
exercising
action
of
ordinary
winds
probably
toughens
the
wood
fibres
of
young
trees
but
this
one
was
no
longer
young
and
the
wind
was
high
i
held
an
ear
against
the
trunk
and
heard
a
humming
whisper
which
told
only
of
soundness
a
blow
with
broad
side
of
my
belt
axe
told
me
that
it
rang
true
and
would
stand
the
storm
and
myself
the
sound
brought
a
spectator
from
a
spruce
with
broken
top
that
stood
almost
within
touching
distance
of
me
in
this
tree
was
a
squirrel
home
and
my
axe
had
brought
the
owner
from
his
hole
what
an
angry
comic
midget
he
was
this
frémont
squirrel
with
fierce
whiskers
and
a
rattling
choppy
jerky
chatter
he
came
out
on
a
dead
limb
that
pointed
toward
me
and
made
a
rush
as
though
to
annihilate
me
or
to
cause
me
to
take
hurried
flight
but
as
i
held
on
he
found
himself
more
up
in
the
air
than
i
was
he
stopped
short
shut
off
his
chatter
and
held
himself
at
close
range
facing
me
a
picture
of
furious
study
this
scene
occurred
in
a
brief
period
that
was
undisturbed
by
either
wind
or
rain
we
had
a
good
look
at
each
other
he
was
every
inch
alive
but
for
a
second
or
two
both
his
place
and
expression
were
fixed
he
sat
with
eyes
full
of
telling
wonder
and
with
face
that
showed
intense
curiosity
a
dash
of
wind
and
rain
ended
our
interview
for
after
his
explosive
introduction
neither
of
us
had
uttered
a
sound
he
fled
into
his
hole
and
from
this
a
moment
later
thrust
forth
his
head
but
presently
he
subsided
and
withdrew
as
i
began
to
climb
again
i
heard
muffled
expletives
from
within
his
tree
that
sounded
plainly
like
fool
fool
fool
the
wind
had
tried
hard
to
dislodge
me
but
seated
on
the
small
limbs
and
astride
the
slender
top
i
held
on
the
tree
shook
and
danced
splendidly
we
charged
circled
looped
and
angled
such
wild
exhilarating
joy
i
have
not
elsewhere
experienced
at
all
times
i
could
feel
in
the
trunk
a
subdued
quiver
or
vibration
and
i
half
believe
that
a
tree
greatest
joys
are
the
dances
it
takes
with
the
winds
conditions
changed
while
i
rocked
there
the
clouds
rose
the
wind
calmed
and
the
rain
ceased
to
fall
thunder
occasionally
rumbled
but
i
was
completely
unprepared
for
the
blinding
flash
and
explosive
crash
of
the
bolt
that
came
the
violent
concussion
the
wave
of
air
which
spread
from
it
like
an
enormous
invisible
breaker
almost
knocked
me
over
a
tall
fir
that
stood
within
fifty
feet
of
me
was
struck
the
top
whirled
off
and
the
trunk
split
in
rails
to
the
ground
i
quickly
went
back
to
earth
for
i
was
eager
to
see
the
full
effect
of
the
lightning
stroke
on
that
tall
slender
evergreen
cone
with
one
wild
mighty
stroke
in
a
second
or
less
the
tree
tower
was
wrecked
leaving
this
centenarian
i
climbed
up
the
incline
a
few
hundred
feet
higher
and
started
out
through
the
woods
to
the
deforested
side
though
it
was
the
last
week
in
june
it
was
not
long
before
i
was
hampered
with
snow
ragged
patches
about
six
feet
deep
covered
more
than
half
of
the
forest
floor
this
was
melting
rapidly
and
was
rotten
from
the
rain
so
that
i
quickly
gave
up
the
difficult
task
of
fording
it
and
made
an
abrupt
descent
until
below
the
where
i
again
headed
for
the
slopes
as
i
was
leaving
the
wood
the
storm
seemed
to
begin
all
over
again
the
rain
at
first
fell
steadily
but
soon
slackened
and
the
lower
began
to
drift
through
the
woods
just
before
reaching
the
barrens
i
paused
to
breathe
in
a
place
where
the
trees
were
well
spaced
and
found
myself
facing
a
large
one
with
deeply
furrowed
bark
and
limbs
plentifully
covered
with
short
fat
blunt
needles
i
was
at
first
puzzled
to
know
what
kind
it
was
but
at
last
i
recognized
it
as
a
douglas
fir
or
oregon
pine
i
had
never
before
seen
this
species
at
so
great
an
altitude
approximately
ten
thousand
feet
it
was
a
long
distance
from
home
but
it
stood
so
contentedly
in
the
quiet
rain
that
i
half
expected
to
hear
it
remark
the
traditions
of
my
family
are
mostly
associated
with
gray
growing
days
of
this
kind
out
on
the
barren
slopes
the
few
widely
scattered
trees
with
broken
arms
stood
partly
concealed
and
lonely
in
the
mists
after
zigzagging
for
a
time
over
the
ruins
i
concluded
to
go
at
once
to
the
uppermost
side
and
thence
down
to
the
forks
but
the
rain
was
again
falling
and
the
clouds
were
so
low
and
heavy
that
the
standing
skeleton
trees
could
not
be
seen
unless
one
was
within
touching
distance
there
was
no
wind
or
lightning
only
a
warm
steady
rain
it
was
in
fact
so
comfortable
that
i
sat
down
to
enjoy
it
until
a
slackening
should
enable
me
better
to
see
the
things
i
most
wanted
to
observe
there
was
no
snow
about
and
three
weeks
before
at
the
same
place
i
had
found
only
one
small
drift
which
was
shielded
and
with
shelving
rock
the
dry
western
air
is
insatiable
and
absorbs
enormous
quantities
of
water
and
as
the
indians
say
eats
snow
the
snowless
area
about
me
was
on
a
similar
slope
and
at
about
the
same
altitude
as
the
woods
so
the
forest
is
evidently
an
effective
check
upon
the
ravenous
winds
now
the
rain
almost
ceased
and
i
began
to
descend
the
upper
gentle
slopes
were
completely
covered
with
a
filmy
sheet
of
clear
water
which
separated
into
tattered
torrents
and
took
on
color
these
united
and
grew
in
size
as
they
progressed
from
the
top
and
each
was
separated
from
its
companions
by
ridges
that
widened
and
gulches
that
deepened
as
down
the
sides
they
went
the
waters
carried
most
of
the
eroded
material
away
but
here
and
there
where
they
crossed
a
comparatively
level
stretch
small
deposits
of
gravel
were
made
or
sandbars
and
deltas
formed
occasionally
i
saw
miniature
landslides
and
hoping
for
a
larger
one
to
move
i
hurried
downward
knowing
that
the
soil
is
often
deep
at
the
foot
of
crags
on
account
of
contributions
from
above
together
with
the
protection
from
erosion
which
the
cliffs
gave
i
endeavored
to
find
such
a
place
while
searching
i
had
occasion
to
jump
from
a
lower
ledge
on
a
cliff
to
the
deposit
below
the
distance
to
the
slope
and
its
real
pitch
were
minimized
by
the
mists
after
shooting
through
the
air
for
at
least
thrice
the
supposed
distance
to
the
slope
i
struck
heavily
and
loosened
several
rods
of
a
landslide
i
tumbled
off
the
back
of
it
but
not
before
its
rock
points
had
made
some
impressions
i
sought
safety
and
a
place
of
lookout
on
a
crag
and
picked
bits
of
granite
gravel
from
my
anatomy
presently
i
heard
a
muffled
creaking
and
looked
up
to
see
a
gigantic
landslide
starting
at
first
it
moved
slowly
seemed
to
hesitate
then
slid
faster
with
its
front
edge
here
and
there
doubling
and
rolling
under
finally
the
entire
mass
broke
into
yawning
ragged
fissures
as
it
shot
forward
and
plunged
over
a
cliff
waiting
until
most
of
the
straggling
detached
riffraff
had
followed
i
hastened
to
examine
the
place
just
evacuated
in
getting
down
i
disturbed
a
from
his
rock
point
and
found
that
he
was
in
the
same
attitude
and
position
i
had
seen
him
holding
just
before
the
slide
started
so
that
the
exhibition
had
merely
caused
him
to
move
his
eyes
a
little
in
the
cracks
and
crevices
of
the
glaciated
from
which
this
mass
had
slid
there
were
broken
roots
and
numerous
marks
which
showed
where
other
roots
had
held
it
seems
probable
that
if
the
grove
which
sustained
them
had
not
been
destroyed
by
fire
they
in
turn
would
have
anchored
and
held
securely
the
portion
of
land
which
had
just
slipped
away
i
went
over
the
lower
slopes
of
the
burned
area
and
had
a
look
at
numerous
gullies
and
near
the
forks
i
measured
a
large
one
it
was
more
than
a
hundred
feet
long
two
to
four
feet
wide
and
over
the
greater
part
of
its
length
more
than
four
feet
deep
it
was
eroded
by
the
late
downpour
and
its
misplaced
material
after
being
deposited
by
the
waters
would
of
itself
almost
call
for
an
increase
of
the
river
and
harbor
appropriations
late
in
the
afternoon
with
the
storm
breaking
i
stopped
and
watched
the
largest
torrent
from
the
devastated
region
pour
over
a
cliff
this
waterfall
more
nearly
represented
a
liquefied
landslide
for
it
was
burdened
with
sediment
and
spoils
as
it
rushed
wildly
over
it
carried
enormous
quantities
of
dirt
gravel
and
other
earthy
wreckage
and
some
of
the
stones
were
as
large
as
a
man
hat
now
and
then
there
was
a
slackening
but
these
momentary
subsidences
were
followed
by
explosive
outpourings
with
which
mingled
large
pieces
of
charred
or
wood
sometimes
closely
pursued
by
a
small
boulder
or
some
surely
these
deforested
slopes
were
heavy
contributors
to
the
millions
of
tons
of
undesirable
matter
that
annually
went
in
to
fill
the
channel
and
vex
the
current
of
the
mississippi
these
demonstrations
brought
to
mind
a
remark
of
an
army
engineer
to
the
effect
that
the
western
forest
fires
had
resulted
in
filling
the
missouri
river
channel
full
of
dissolved
rocky
mountains
the
action
of
the
water
on
this
single
burned
area
suggested
that
ten
thousand
other
fireswept
heights
must
be
rapidly
diminishing
at
all
events
it
is
evident
that
unless
this
erosion
is
stopped
boats
before
long
will
hardly
find
room
to
enter
the
mississippi
it
now
became
easier
to
account
for
the
channel
of
the
great
river
and
also
for
the
innumerable
bars
that
display
their
broad
backs
above
its
shallow
sluggish
water
every
smooth
or
fluted
fill
in
this
great
stream
tells
of
a
ragged
gulch
or
a
roughened
soilless
place
somewhere
on
a
slope
at
one
of
its
sources
what
a
mingling
of
matter
makes
up
the
mud
of
the
mississippi
a
soil
mixture
from
twenty
states
the
blended
richness
of
ten
thousand
slopes
coming
up
the
father
of
waters
and
noting
its
obstructions
of
sediment
and
sand
its
embarrassment
of
misplaced
material
its
dumps
and
deposits
of
soil
monumental
ruins
of
wasted
resources
one
may
say
here
lies
the
lineal
descendant
of
peak
here
the
greater
part
of
an
ohio
hill
or
a
flood
took
this
from
a
terraced
and
this
from
a
farm
in
sunny
tennessee
a
mud
flat
itself
might
remark
the
thoughtless
lumberman
who
caused
my
downfall
is
now
in
congress
urging
river
improvement
and
the
shallow
waters
at
the
big
bend
could
add
our
once
deep
channel
was
filled
with
soil
from
a
mountain
the
minister
whose
vacation
fire
caused
this
ruin
is
now
a
militant
missionary
among
the
heathen
of
cherry
blossom
land
wondering
if
the
ouzel
boulder
had
been
rolled
away
or
if
the
deep
hole
above
it
where
the
mill
men
caught
trout
had
been
filled
with
wash
i
decided
to
go
at
once
and
see
and
then
return
for
a
final
look
about
the
forks
yes
the
boulder
was
missing
apparently
buried
for
the
hole
was
and
the
trout
gone
so
it
was
evident
that
forests
were
helpful
even
to
the
fish
in
the
streams
i
took
off
my
hat
to
the
trees
and
started
back
to
the
junction
on
the
way
i
resolved
to
tell
the
men
in
the
mill
that
a
tree
is
the
most
useful
thing
that
grows
and
that
floods
may
be
checked
by
forests
the
storm
was
over
and
the
clouds
were
retreating
on
a
fallen
log
that
lay
across
the
main
stream
i
lingered
and
watched
the
dark
and
white
waters
mingle
the
white
stream
was
slowly
rising
while
the
dark
one
was
rapidly
falling
in
a
few
days
the
one
from
the
barren
slopes
would
be
hardly
alive
while
the
other
from
among
the
trees
would
be
singing
a
song
full
of
strength
as
it
swept
on
toward
the
sea
illustration
full
streams
the
stream
is
the
useful
and
beautiful
one
it
has
a
steady
flow
of
clear
water
and
fishermen
cheerfully
come
to
its
green
mossy
banks
the
buildings
along
its
course
are
safe
from
floods
and
are
steadily
served
with
the
power
of
its
reliable
flow
its
channel
is
free
from
mud
and
full
of
water
it
allows
the
busy
boats
of
commerce
freely
to
come
and
go
in
countless
ways
it
serves
the
activities
of
man
it
never
causes
damage
and
always
enriches
and
gladdens
the
valley
through
which
it
flows
on
to
the
sea
a
song
roused
me
from
my
revery
the
sky
was
almost
clear
and
the
long
ragged
shadows
of
the
nearest
peaks
streamed
far
toward
the
east
not
a
breath
of
air
stirred
far
away
a
hermit
thrush
was
singing
while
a
thousand
spruces
stood
and
listened
in
the
midst
of
this
a
solitaire
on
the
top
of
a
pine
tree
burst
out
in
marvelous
melody
the
fate
of
a
tree
seed
the
fate
of
a
tree
seed
the
ripened
seeds
of
trees
are
sent
forth
with
many
strange
devices
and
at
random
for
the
unoccupied
and
fertile
places
of
the
earth
there
are
six
hundred
kinds
of
trees
in
north
america
and
each
of
these
equips
its
seeds
in
a
peculiar
way
that
they
may
take
advantage
of
wind
gravity
water
birds
or
beasts
to
transport
them
on
their
journey
the
whole
story
is
a
fascinating
one
blindly
often
thick
as
snow
the
seeds
go
forth
to
seek
their
fortune
to
find
a
all
are
in
danger
many
are
limited
as
to
time
and
the
majority
are
restricted
to
a
single
effort
a
few
however
have
a
complex
and
novel
equipment
and
with
this
make
a
long
romantic
and
sometimes
an
adventurous
journey
colonizing
at
last
some
strange
land
far
from
the
place
of
their
birth
commonly
however
this
journey
is
brief
and
usually
after
one
short
fall
or
flight
the
seed
comes
to
rest
where
it
will
sprout
or
perish
generally
it
dies
one
autumn
afternoon
in
southeastern
missouri
seated
upon
some
driftwood
on
the
shallow
margin
of
the
mississippi
i
discovered
a
primitive
craft
that
was
carrying
a
colony
of
adventurous
tree
seeds
down
the
mighty
river
as
i
watched
and
listened
the
nuts
pattered
upon
the
fallen
leaves
and
the
father
of
waters
purled
and
whispered
as
he
slipped
his
broad
current
almost
silently
to
the
sea
here
and
there
a
few
sandbars
showed
themselves
above
the
surface
as
though
preparing
to
rise
up
and
inquire
what
had
become
of
the
water
this
primitive
craft
was
a
log
that
drifted
low
and
heavy
end
on
with
the
current
it
was
going
somewhere
with
a
small
cargo
of
tree
seeds
upon
a
broken
upraised
limb
of
the
log
sat
a
kingfisher
as
it
drifted
with
the
current
breezes
upon
the
wooded
decorated
the
autumn
air
with
deliberately
falling
leaves
and
floating
winged
seeds
the
floating
log
pointed
straight
for
a
upon
which
other
logs
and
snags
were
stranded
i
determined
when
it
should
come
aground
to
see
the
character
of
the
cargo
that
it
carried
now
and
then
as
i
sat
there
the
heavy
round
nuts
like
merry
boys
came
bounding
and
rattling
down
the
hillside
which
rose
from
the
water
edge
occasionally
as
a
nut
dropped
from
the
he
struck
a
limb
spring
board
and
from
this
made
a
long
leap
outward
for
a
roll
down
the
hillside
these
nuts
were
walnut
and
hickory
and
like
most
heavy
nuts
they
traveled
by
rolling
floating
and
squirrel
carriage
one
nut
dropped
upon
a
low
limb
glanced
far
outward
and
landed
upon
a
log
from
which
it
bounced
outward
and
went
bouncing
down
the
hillside
into
the
river
slowly
it
rolled
this
way
and
that
in
the
almost
currentless
water
at
last
it
made
up
its
mind
and
with
the
almost
invisible
swells
commenced
to
float
slowly
toward
the
floating
log
out
in
the
river
by
and
by
the
current
caught
it
carried
it
toward
and
round
the
to
float
away
with
the
onsweep
toward
the
sea
this
nut
may
have
been
carried
a
few
miles
or
a
few
hundred
before
it
went
ashore
on
the
bank
of
the
river
or
landed
upon
some
romantic
island
to
sprout
and
grow
seeds
often
are
carried
by
rivers
and
then
successfully
planted
after
many
stops
and
advances
far
from
the
parent
tree
the
log
hesitated
as
it
approached
the
as
if
cautiously
smelling
with
its
big
rooty
nose
but
at
last
it
swung
round
broadside
and
sleepily
allowed
the
current
to
put
it
to
bed
upon
the
sand
as
a
tree
this
log
had
lived
on
the
banks
of
the
mississippi
or
one
of
its
tributaries
in
minnesota
while
standing
it
had
for
a
time
served
as
a
woodpecker
home
in
one
of
the
larger
excavations
made
by
these
birds
i
found
some
white
pine
cones
and
other
seeds
from
the
north
that
had
been
stored
by
bird
or
squirrel
a
long
voyage
these
seeds
had
taken
they
may
have
continued
the
journey
landing
at
last
to
grow
in
sunny
tennessee
or
they
may
have
sunk
to
the
bottom
of
the
river
or
even
have
perished
in
the
salt
waters
of
the
gulf
in
climbing
up
the
steep
hillside
above
the
river
i
found
many
nests
of
hickory
and
walnuts
against
the
upper
side
of
fallen
logs
upon
the
level
the
ground
beneath
the
tree
was
thickly
covered
with
fallen
nuts
only
a
few
of
these
had
got
a
tree
length
away
from
the
parent
occasionally
however
a
used
a
long
slender
limb
as
a
sling
and
flung
the
attached
nuts
afar
the
squirrels
were
active
laying
up
a
hoard
of
nuts
for
winter
many
a
walnut
hickory
or
butternut
tree
at
some
distant
place
may
have
grown
from
an
uneaten
or
forgotten
nut
which
the
squirrels
carried
away
the
winged
seeds
are
the
ones
that
are
most
widely
scattered
these
are
grown
by
many
kinds
of
trees
from
may
until
midwinter
trees
of
this
kind
are
giving
their
little
atoms
of
life
to
the
great
the
wind
most
winged
seeds
have
one
wing
for
each
seed
and
commonly
each
makes
but
one
flight
generally
the
lighter
the
seed
and
the
higher
the
wind
the
farther
the
seed
will
fly
or
be
blown
in
may
the
silver
maple
starts
the
flight
of
winged
seeds
this
tree
has
a
seed
about
the
size
of
a
peanut
provided
with
a
wing
as
large
as
one
thumb
it
sails
away
from
the
tree
settling
rapidly
toward
the
earth
with
heavy
end
downward
whirling
round
and
round
as
it
falls
red
maple
seeds
ripen
in
june
but
not
until
autumn
does
the
hard
maple
send
its
winged
ones
forth
from
amid
the
painted
leaves
the
seed
of
an
ash
tree
is
like
a
dart
in
the
different
ashes
these
are
of
different
lengths
but
all
have
wings
which
in
calm
weather
dart
the
seed
to
the
snowy
earth
but
in
a
lively
wind
they
are
tumbled
and
whirled
about
while
being
unceremoniously
carried
afar
this
they
do
not
mind
for
at
the
first
lull
they
right
themselves
and
drop
in
good
form
to
the
earth
cottonwoods
and
willows
send
forth
their
seeds
inclosed
in
a
dainty
puff
or
ball
of
silky
cotton
that
is
so
light
that
the
wind
often
carries
it
long
distances
with
the
willow
this
device
is
so
airy
and
dainty
that
it
is
easily
entangled
on
twigs
or
grass
and
may
never
reach
the
earth
the
willow
seed
too
is
so
feeble
that
it
will
often
perish
inside
hours
if
it
does
not
find
a
most
favorable
this
makes
but
little
difference
to
the
willows
for
they
do
not
depend
upon
seeds
for
extension
but
upon
the
breaking
off
of
roots
or
twigs
by
various
agencies
these
pieces
of
roots
or
twigs
often
are
carried
miles
by
streams
and
take
root
perhaps
at
the
first
place
where
they
go
around
the
seeds
of
the
sycamore
are
in
balls
attached
to
the
limbs
by
a
slender
twiglet
the
winter
winds
beat
and
thump
these
balls
against
the
limbs
thus
causing
the
seeds
to
loosen
and
to
drop
a
few
at
a
time
to
the
earth
each
seed
is
a
light
little
pencil
which
at
one
end
is
equipped
with
a
whorl
of
hairs
a
parachute
which
delays
its
fall
and
thus
enables
the
wind
to
carry
it
away
from
the
parent
tree
the
conifers
the
pines
firs
and
spruces
have
ingeniously
devised
and
developed
their
winged
seeds
for
wind
distribution
most
of
these
seeds
are
light
and
each
is
attached
to
a
dainty
feather
or
wing
which
is
used
on
its
commencement
day
these
wings
are
as
handsome
as
insects
wings
dainty
enough
for
fairies
they
are
purple
plain
brown
and
spotted
and
so
balanced
that
they
revolve
or
whirl
glinting
in
the
autumn
sun
as
they
go
on
their
adventurous
flight
to
the
earth
a
high
wind
may
carry
them
miles
with
the
pines
and
spruces
the
cones
open
one
or
a
few
scales
at
a
time
so
that
the
seeds
from
each
cone
are
distributed
through
many
days
the
firs
however
carry
cones
that
when
ripe
often
collapse
in
the
wind
the
entire
filling
of
seeds
are
thus
dropped
at
once
and
fill
the
air
with
flocks
of
merry
diving
glinting
wings
a
heavy
in
a
coniferous
forest
gives
a
touch
of
poetry
to
the
viewless
air
the
pine
is
one
of
the
most
patient
and
philosophical
in
the
forest
it
is
a
prolific
and
has
a
remarkable
hoarding
characteristic
that
of
keeping
its
cones
closed
and
holding
on
to
them
for
years
commonly
a
forest
fire
kills
trees
without
consuming
them
with
the
the
fire
frequently
burns
off
the
needles
leaving
the
tree
standing
but
it
melts
the
on
the
cones
thus
the
fire
releases
these
seeds
and
they
fall
upon
a
freshly
soil
a
condition
for
them
most
favorable
although
the
cherry
is
without
wings
or
a
of
its
own
it
is
rich
enough
to
employ
the
rarest
transportation
in
the
world
with
attractively
colored
and
luscious
pulp
it
hires
many
beautiful
birds
to
carry
it
to
new
scenes
on
the
wings
of
the
mockingbird
and
the
hermit
thrush
what
a
happy
and
romantic
way
in
which
to
seek
the
promised
land
many
kinds
of
seeds
that
are
attractive
and
delicious
when
ripe
are
unpleasant
to
the
taste
while
green
this
protective
measure
guards
them
against
being
sown
before
they
are
ready
or
ripe
the
instant
persimmons
are
ripe
the
trees
are
full
of
opossums
which
disseminate
the
seeds
but
avoids
the
green
and
puckery
persimmons
the
big
tree
is
one
of
the
most
fruitful
of
in
a
single
year
one
of
these
may
produce
some
millions
of
fertile
seeds
these
mature
in
comparatively
small
cones
and
each
seed
being
light
as
air
they
are
sometimes
carried
by
high
winds
across
ridges
and
ravines
before
being
dropped
to
the
earth
the
honey
locust
uses
a
peculiar
device
to
secure
wind
assistance
in
pushing
afar
its
long
purplish
pods
with
their
heavy
beanlike
seeds
this
pod
is
not
only
flattened
but
crooked
and
slightly
twisted
dropping
from
the
tree
in
midwinter
it
often
lands
upon
crusted
snow
here
on
windy
days
it
becomes
a
kind
of
crude
and
goes
skimming
along
before
the
wind
with
its
flattened
twisted
surface
it
ever
presents
a
to
the
breeze
the
ironwood
tree
launches
its
seeds
each
seated
in
the
prow
of
a
tiny
boat
which
floats
or
careers
away
upon
the
invisible
ocean
of
air
sinking
after
a
rudderless
voyage
to
the
earth
the
attachment
to
some
seeds
is
or
tied
helplessly
to
this
the
seed
is
cast
forth
briefly
to
wander
with
the
wandering
winds
the
linden
or
basswood
tree
uses
a
monoplane
for
buoyancy
the
basswood
attaches
or
suspends
a
number
of
seeds
by
slender
threads
to
the
centre
of
a
leaf
in
autumn
when
this
falls
it
resists
gravity
for
a
time
and
ofttimes
with
its
clinging
cargo
alights
far
from
the
tree
which
sent
it
forth
or
seeds
may
become
attached
to
the
backs
of
animals
and
thus
be
transported
afar
one
day
in
colorado
i
disturbed
a
black
bear
in
some
willows
more
than
a
mile
from
the
woods
as
he
ran
over
a
grassy
ridge
three
or
four
pine
cones
that
had
been
hooked
and
entangled
in
his
hair
went
spinning
off
seeds
sometimes
are
internationally
distributed
by
becoming
attached
by
some
sticky
substance
pitch
or
dried
mud
to
the
legs
or
feathers
of
birds
cottonwood
seed
often
has
a
long
ride
though
generally
a
fruitless
one
by
alighting
in
the
hair
of
some
animal
sometimes
a
cone
or
nut
becomes
wedged
between
the
hoofs
of
an
animal
and
is
carried
about
for
days
taken
miles
before
it
is
dropped
it
grows
a
lone
tree
far
from
the
nearest
grove
though
the
is
no
longer
invested
with
eerie
charms
it
still
has
its
own
peculiar
way
of
doing
things
it
chooses
to
bloom
alone
in
the
autumn
just
at
the
time
its
seeds
are
ripe
and
scattering
assisted
by
the
frost
and
the
sun
it
scatters
its
shotlike
seeds
with
a
series
of
snappy
little
explosions
which
fling
them
twelve
to
twenty
feet
from
the
capsule
in
which
they
ripen
the
mangrove
trees
of
florida
germinate
their
seeds
upon
the
tree
and
then
drop
little
plants
off
into
the
water
here
winds
and
currents
may
move
them
hither
and
yon
as
they
blindly
explore
for
a
the
cocoanut
tree
covers
its
nuts
with
a
kind
of
excelsior
which
prevents
their
breaking
upon
the
rocks
this
also
facilitates
the
floating
and
transportation
of
the
nut
in
the
sea
when
the
breakers
have
flung
it
upon
rocks
or
broken
reefs
here
its
fibrous
covering
helps
it
cling
until
the
young
roots
grow
and
anchor
it
securely
thus
endlessly
during
all
the
seasons
of
the
year
the
trees
are
sowing
their
ripened
seed
and
sending
them
forth
variously
equipped
blindly
to
seek
a
place
in
which
they
may
live
perpetuate
the
species
and
extend
the
forest
it
is
well
that
nature
sows
seeds
like
a
spendthrift
so
many
are
the
chances
against
the
seed
so
numerous
are
the
destroying
agencies
so
few
are
the
places
in
reach
that
are
unoccupied
that
perhaps
not
more
than
one
seed
in
a
million
ever
germinates
and
hardly
one
tree
in
a
thousand
that
starts
to
grow
ever
attains
maturity
through
sheer
force
of
numbers
and
continuous
the
necessarily
random
methods
of
nature
produce
results
and
where
opportunity
opens
trees
promptly
extend
their
holdings
or
reclaim
a
territory
from
which
they
have
been
driven
many
times
i
have
wandered
through
the
coniferous
forests
in
the
mountains
when
the
seeds
were
ripe
and
fluttering
thick
as
snowflakes
to
the
earth
visiting
ridges
slopes
and
cañons
i
have
watched
the
pines
firs
and
spruces
closing
a
year
busy
invisible
activity
by
merrily
strewing
the
air
and
the
earth
with
their
fruits
seeding
for
the
centuries
to
come
one
breathless
autumn
day
i
looked
up
into
the
blue
sky
from
the
bottom
of
a
cañon
the
golden
air
was
as
thickly
filled
with
winged
seeds
as
a
perfect
night
with
stars
a
light
local
made
a
milky
way
across
this
sky
myriads
of
becalmed
and
suspended
seeds
were
fixed
stars
some
of
the
seeds
each
with
a
filmy
wing
hurried
through
elliptical
orbits
like
comets
as
they
settled
to
the
earth
while
innumerable
others
as
they
came
rotating
down
were
revolving
through
planetary
orbits
in
this
field
of
space
now
and
then
a
number
of
cones
on
a
fir
tree
collapsed
and
precipitated
into
space
a
meteoric
shower
of
seeds
and
a
hurried
zigzag
fall
of
heavier
scales
occasionally
on
a
a
few
of
the
lighter
seeds
would
come
floating
upward
through
an
as
though
carried
in
an
invisible
one
windy
day
i
crossed
the
mountains
when
a
gale
was
driving
millions
of
seeds
before
it
away
they
swept
down
the
slope
to
whirl
widely
and
flutter
over
the
gulch
where
the
dashed
against
the
uprising
mountain
beyond
most
of
the
seeds
were
flung
to
the
earth
along
the
way
or
dropped
in
the
bottom
of
the
gulch
a
few
however
were
carried
by
the
swift
uprushing
current
up
and
across
the
mountain
and
at
last
scattered
on
the
opposite
side
when
the
last
seed
of
the
year
has
fallen
how
thickly
the
woodland
regions
are
sown
broadcast
with
seeds
only
a
few
of
these
will
have
landed
in
a
hospitable
place
the
overwhelmingly
majority
fell
in
the
water
to
drown
or
on
rock
ledges
or
other
places
to
starve
or
wither
the
few
fortunate
enough
to
find
unoccupied
and
fertile
places
will
still
have
to
reckon
with
devouring
insects
and
animals
how
different
may
be
the
environment
of
two
seedlings
sprung
from
seeds
grown
on
the
selfsame
tree
on
their
commencement
day
two
little
atoms
of
life
may
be
separated
by
the
wind
one
finds
shelter
and
fertile
earth
the
other
roots
in
a
barely
livable
place
on
the
cold
stormbeaten
heights
of
both
use
their
inherent
energy
and
effort
to
the
utmost
one
becomes
a
forest
monarch
the
other
a
dwarf
uncouth
and
ugly
in
a
mountain
blizzard
in
a
mountain
blizzard
at
the
close
of
one
of
our
winter
trips
my
collie
scotch
and
i
started
across
the
continental
divide
of
the
rocky
mountains
in
face
of
weather
conditions
that
indicated
a
snowstorm
or
a
blizzard
before
we
could
gain
the
other
side
we
had
eaten
the
last
of
our
food
hours
before
and
could
no
longer
wait
for
fair
weather
so
off
we
started
to
scale
the
snowy
steeps
of
the
cold
gray
heights
a
thousand
feet
above
the
mountains
already
were
deeply
and
it
would
have
been
a
hard
trip
even
without
the
discomforts
and
dangers
of
a
storm
i
was
on
snowshoes
and
for
a
week
we
had
been
camping
and
tramping
through
the
snowy
forests
and
glacier
meadows
at
the
source
of
grand
river
two
miles
above
the
sea
the
primeval
rocky
mountain
forests
are
just
as
near
to
nature
heart
in
winter
as
in
summer
i
had
found
so
much
to
study
and
enjoy
that
the
long
distance
from
a
even
when
the
last
mouthful
was
eaten
had
not
aroused
me
to
the
seriousness
of
the
situation
scotch
had
not
complained
and
appeared
to
have
the
keenest
collie
interest
in
the
tracks
and
trails
the
scenes
and
silences
away
from
the
haunts
of
man
the
snow
lay
seven
feet
deep
but
by
keeping
in
my
snowshoe
tracks
scotch
easily
followed
me
about
our
last
camp
was
in
the
depths
of
an
alpine
forest
at
an
altitude
of
ten
thousand
feet
here
though
zero
weather
prevailed
we
were
easily
comfortable
beside
a
fire
under
the
protection
of
an
overhanging
cliff
after
a
walk
through
woods
the
sun
came
blazing
in
our
faces
past
the
crags
on
long
peak
and
threw
slender
blue
shadows
of
the
spiry
spruces
far
out
in
a
white
glacier
meadow
to
meet
us
rëentering
the
tall
but
open
woods
we
saw
down
the
long
aisles
and
avenues
a
forest
of
tree
columns
entangled
in
sunlight
and
shadow
standing
on
a
snowy
marble
floor
illustration
on
grand
river
middle
park
in
winter
we
were
on
the
pacific
slope
and
our
plan
was
to
cross
the
summit
by
the
shortest
way
between
and
on
the
atlantic
side
this
meant
ascending
a
thousand
feet
descending
an
equal
distance
traveling
five
miles
amid
bleak
rugged
environment
along
the
treeless
gradual
ascent
we
started
realizing
that
the
last
steep
icy
climb
would
be
dangerous
and
defiant
most
of
the
snow
had
slid
from
the
steeper
places
and
much
of
the
remainder
had
blown
away
over
the
unsheltered
whole
the
wind
was
howling
for
a
time
the
sun
shone
dimly
through
the
that
rolled
from
the
top
of
the
range
but
it
disappeared
early
behind
wild
windswept
clouds
after
gaining
a
thousand
feet
of
altitude
through
the
friendly
forest
we
climbed
out
and
up
above
the
trees
on
a
steep
slope
at
this
place
the
farthest
up
for
trees
was
a
picturesque
desolate
place
the
dwarfed
gnarled
trees
amid
enormous
told
of
endless
and
at
times
deadly
struggles
of
the
trees
with
the
elements
most
of
the
trees
were
buried
but
here
and
there
a
leaning
or
a
one
bent
bravely
above
the
snows
at
last
we
were
safely
on
a
ridge
and
started
merrily
off
hoping
to
cover
speedily
the
three
miles
of
comparatively
level
plateau
how
the
wind
did
blow
up
more
than
eleven
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
with
not
a
tree
to
steady
or
break
it
had
a
royal
sweep
the
wind
appeared
to
be
putting
forth
its
wildest
efforts
to
blow
us
off
the
ridge
there
being
a
broad
way
i
kept
well
from
the
edges
the
wind
came
with
a
dash
and
heavy
rush
first
from
one
quarter
then
from
another
i
was
watchful
and
faced
each
rush
firmly
braced
generally
this
preparedness
saved
me
but
several
times
the
wind
apparently
expanded
or
exploded
beneath
me
and
with
an
upward
toss
i
was
flung
among
the
icy
rocks
and
crusted
snows
finally
i
took
to
dropping
and
lying
flat
whenever
a
violent
gust
came
ripping
among
the
crags
there
was
an
arctic
barrenness
to
this
alpine
ridge
not
a
house
within
miles
no
trail
and
here
no
tree
could
live
to
soften
the
sternness
of
the
landscape
or
to
cheer
the
traveler
the
way
was
amid
snowy
piles
icy
spaces
and
windswept
crags
the
wind
slackened
and
snow
began
to
fall
just
as
we
were
leaving
the
smooth
plateau
for
the
broken
part
of
the
divide
the
next
mile
of
way
was
badly
cut
to
pieces
with
deep
gorges
from
both
sides
of
the
ridge
the
inner
ends
of
several
of
these
broke
through
the
centre
of
the
ridge
and
extended
beyond
the
ends
of
the
gorges
from
the
opposite
side
this
made
the
course
a
series
of
sharp
short
zigzags
we
went
forward
in
the
flying
snow
i
could
scarcely
see
but
felt
that
i
could
keep
the
way
on
the
broken
ridge
between
the
numerous
rents
and
cañons
on
snowy
icy
ledges
the
wind
took
reckless
liberties
i
wanted
to
stop
but
dared
not
for
the
cold
was
intense
enough
to
freeze
one
in
a
few
minutes
fearing
that
a
might
separate
us
i
fastened
one
end
of
my
light
strong
rope
to
scotch
collar
and
the
other
end
to
my
belt
this
proved
to
be
fortunate
for
both
for
while
we
were
crossing
an
icy
though
moderate
slope
a
gust
of
wind
swept
me
off
my
feet
and
started
us
sliding
it
was
not
steep
but
was
so
slippery
i
could
not
stop
nor
see
where
the
slope
ended
and
i
grabbed
in
vain
at
the
few
icy
projections
scotch
also
lost
his
footing
and
was
sliding
and
rolling
about
and
the
wind
was
hurrying
us
along
when
i
threw
myself
flat
and
dug
at
the
ice
with
fingers
and
toes
in
the
midst
of
my
unsuccessful
efforts
we
were
brought
to
a
sudden
stop
by
the
rope
between
us
catching
over
a
small
that
was
thrust
up
through
the
ice
around
this
in
every
direction
was
smooth
sloping
ice
this
with
the
high
wind
made
me
wonder
for
a
moment
how
we
were
to
get
safely
off
the
slope
the
belt
axe
proved
the
means
for
with
it
i
reached
out
as
far
as
i
could
and
chopped
a
hole
in
the
ice
while
with
the
other
hand
i
clung
to
the
then
returning
the
axe
to
my
belt
i
caught
hold
in
the
chopped
place
and
pulled
myself
forward
repeating
this
until
on
safe
footing
in
oncoming
darkness
and
whirling
snow
i
had
safely
rounded
the
ends
of
two
gorges
and
was
hurrying
forward
over
a
comparatively
level
stretch
with
the
wind
at
my
back
boosting
along
scotch
was
running
by
my
side
and
evidently
was
trusting
me
to
guard
against
all
dangers
this
i
tried
to
do
suddenly
however
there
came
a
fierce
dash
of
wind
and
whirl
of
snow
that
hid
everything
instantly
i
flung
myself
flat
trying
to
stop
quickly
just
as
i
did
this
i
caught
the
strange
weird
sound
made
by
high
wind
as
it
sweeps
across
a
cañon
and
at
once
realized
that
we
were
close
to
a
gorge
i
stopped
against
a
rock
while
scotch
slid
in
and
was
hauled
back
with
the
rope
the
gorge
had
been
encountered
between
two
side
gorges
and
between
these
in
the
darkness
i
had
a
cold
time
feeling
my
way
out
at
last
i
came
to
a
cairn
of
stones
which
i
recognized
the
way
had
been
missed
by
only
a
few
yards
but
this
miss
had
been
nearly
fatal
not
daring
to
hurry
in
the
darkness
in
order
to
get
warm
i
was
becoming
colder
every
moment
i
still
had
a
stiff
climb
between
me
and
the
summit
with
three
rough
miles
beyond
to
attempt
to
make
it
would
probably
result
in
freezing
or
tumbling
into
a
gorge
at
last
i
realized
that
i
must
stop
and
spend
the
night
in
a
quickly
kicking
and
trampling
a
trench
in
a
loose
drift
i
placed
my
therein
thrust
scotch
into
the
bag
and
then
squeezed
into
it
myself
i
was
almost
congealed
with
cold
my
first
thought
after
warming
up
was
to
wonder
why
i
had
not
earlier
remembered
the
bag
two
in
a
bag
would
guarantee
warmth
and
with
warmth
a
on
the
crest
of
the
continent
would
not
be
a
bad
place
in
which
to
lodge
for
the
night
the
sounds
of
wind
and
snow
beating
upon
the
bag
grew
fainter
and
fainter
as
we
were
drifted
and
piled
over
with
the
latter
at
the
same
time
our
temperature
rose
and
before
long
it
was
necessary
to
open
the
flap
of
the
bag
slightly
for
ventilation
at
last
the
sounds
of
the
storm
could
barely
be
heard
was
the
storm
quieting
down
or
was
its
roar
muffled
and
lost
in
the
deepening
cover
of
snow
was
the
unimportant
question
occupying
my
thoughts
when
i
fell
asleep
scotch
awakened
me
in
trying
to
get
out
of
the
bag
it
was
morning
out
we
crawled
and
standing
with
only
my
head
above
the
drift
i
found
the
air
still
and
saw
a
snowy
mountain
world
all
serene
in
the
morning
sun
i
hastily
adjusted
and
snowshoes
and
we
set
off
for
the
final
climb
to
the
summit
the
final
one
hundred
feet
or
so
rose
steep
jagged
and
before
me
there
was
nothing
to
lay
hold
of
every
point
of
vantage
was
plated
and
coated
with
ice
there
appeared
only
one
way
to
surmount
this
icy
barrier
and
that
was
to
chop
toe
and
hand
holes
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
of
this
icy
wall
which
in
places
was
close
to
vertical
such
a
climb
would
not
be
especially
difficult
or
dangerous
for
me
but
could
scotch
do
it
he
could
hardly
know
how
to
place
his
feet
in
the
holes
or
on
the
steps
properly
nor
could
he
realize
that
a
slip
or
a
misstep
would
mean
a
slide
and
a
roll
to
death
leaving
and
snowshoes
with
scotch
i
grasped
my
axe
and
chopped
my
way
to
the
top
and
then
went
down
and
carried
bag
and
snowshoes
up
returning
for
scotch
i
started
him
climbing
just
ahead
of
me
so
that
i
could
boost
and
encourage
him
we
had
gained
only
a
few
feet
when
it
became
plain
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
slip
and
bring
disaster
to
both
we
stopped
and
descended
to
the
bottom
for
a
new
start
though
the
wind
was
again
blowing
a
gale
i
determined
to
carry
him
his
weight
was
forty
pounds
and
he
would
make
a
load
and
give
the
wind
a
good
chance
to
upset
my
balance
and
tip
me
off
the
wall
but
as
there
appeared
no
other
way
i
threw
him
over
my
shoulder
and
started
up
many
times
scotch
and
i
had
been
in
ticklish
places
together
and
more
than
once
i
had
pulled
him
up
rocky
cliffs
on
which
he
could
not
find
footing
several
times
i
had
carried
him
over
gulches
on
fallen
logs
that
were
too
slippery
for
him
he
was
so
trusting
and
so
trained
that
he
relaxed
and
never
moved
while
in
my
arms
or
on
my
shoulder
illustration
snow
and
shadow
arriving
at
the
place
least
steep
i
stopped
to
transfer
scotch
from
one
shoulder
to
the
other
the
wind
was
at
its
worst
its
direction
frequently
changed
and
it
alternately
calmed
and
then
came
on
like
an
explosion
for
several
seconds
it
had
been
roaring
down
the
slope
bracing
myself
to
withstand
its
force
from
this
direction
i
was
about
moving
scotch
when
it
suddenly
shifted
to
one
side
and
came
with
the
force
of
a
breaker
it
threw
me
off
my
balance
and
tumbled
me
heavily
against
the
icy
slope
though
my
head
struck
solidly
scotch
came
down
beneath
me
and
took
most
of
the
shock
instantly
we
glanced
off
and
began
to
slide
swiftly
fortunately
i
managed
to
get
two
fingers
into
one
of
the
chopped
holes
and
held
fast
i
clung
to
scotch
with
one
arm
we
came
to
a
stop
both
saved
scotch
gave
a
yelp
of
pain
when
he
fell
beneath
me
but
he
did
not
move
had
he
made
a
jump
or
attempted
to
help
himself
it
is
likely
that
both
of
us
would
have
gone
to
the
bottom
of
the
slope
gripping
scotch
with
one
hand
and
clinging
to
the
icy
hold
with
the
other
i
shuffled
about
until
i
got
my
feet
into
two
holes
in
the
icy
wall
standing
in
these
and
leaning
against
the
ice
with
the
wind
butting
and
dashing
i
attempted
the
ticklish
task
of
lifting
scotch
again
to
my
shoulder
and
succeeded
a
minute
later
we
paused
to
breathe
on
the
summit
icy
ridge
between
two
oceans
and
amid
seas
of
snowy
peaks
a
midget
in
fur
a
midget
in
fur
the
frémont
squirrel
is
the
most
audacious
and
of
wild
folk
among
whom
i
have
lived
he
appears
to
be
ever
up
and
doing
is
intensely
in
earnest
at
all
times
and
strongly
inclined
to
take
a
serious
view
of
things
both
the
looks
and
manners
of
frémont
proclaim
for
him
a
close
relationship
with
the
douglas
squirrel
of
california
and
the
pacific
coast
the
squirrel
immortalized
by
john
muir
his
most
popular
name
is
pine
squirrel
and
he
is
found
through
the
pine
and
spruce
forests
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
its
spur
ranges
between
the
foothills
and
a
vertical
or
altitudinal
range
of
more
than
a
mile
he
assumes
and
asserts
ownership
of
the
region
occupied
if
you
invade
his
forests
he
will
see
you
first
and
watch
you
closely
often
he
does
this
with
simple
curiosity
but
more
often
he
is
irritated
by
your
presence
and
issues
a
chattering
protest
while
you
are
still
at
long
range
if
you
continue
to
approach
after
this
proclamation
he
may
come
down
on
a
low
limb
near
by
and
give
you
as
torrential
and
as
abusive
a
cussing
as
trespasser
ever
received
from
irate
owner
yet
he
is
most
ridiculously
small
to
do
all
that
he
threatens
to
do
of
course
he
brags
and
bluffs
but
these
become
admirable
qualities
in
this
little
fellow
who
will
ably
desperately
defend
his
domain
against
heavy
odds
of
size
or
numbers
among
the
squirrels
of
the
world
he
is
one
of
the
smallest
he
is
clad
in
gray
and
his
coat
perceptibly
darkens
in
winter
his
plumy
tail
with
a
fringe
of
white
hairs
is
as
airy
as
thistledown
he
always
appears
clean
and
though
in
many
ways
a
grizzly
in
miniature
and
apparently
as
untamable
as
a
tiger
the
frémont
quickly
responds
to
kind
advances
near
my
cabin
a
number
became
so
tame
that
they
took
peanuts
from
my
hand
sometimes
even
following
me
to
the
cabin
door
for
this
purpose
these
squirrels
occasionally
eat
mushrooms
berries
and
the
inner
bark
of
pine
twigs
but
they
depend
almost
entirely
upon
conifer
nuts
or
seeds
the
greater
part
of
these
coming
from
the
cones
of
pines
and
spruces
they
start
harvesting
the
cones
in
early
autumn
so
as
to
harvest
all
needed
food
for
winter
before
the
dry
ripened
cones
open
and
empty
their
tiny
seeds
deftly
they
dart
through
the
almost
as
swiftly
as
a
hummingbird
and
as
utterly
indifferent
to
the
dangers
of
falling
with
polished
blades
of
ivory
they
clip
off
the
clinging
fruited
cones
happy
hopeful
sounds
the
cones
make
as
they
drop
and
bounce
on
the
dry
floor
of
the
autumn
woods
often
a
pair
work
together
one
reaping
the
cones
with
his
ivory
cutters
and
the
other
carrying
them
home
each
being
a
sheaf
of
grain
of
nature
bundling
when
harvesting
alone
frémont
is
often
annoyed
by
the
chipmunks
these
little
rascals
will
persist
in
stealing
the
fallen
cones
despite
glaring
eyes
irate
looks
and
deadly
threats
from
the
angry
harvester
above
when
finally
he
comes
tearing
down
to
carry
his
terrible
ultimatums
into
effect
the
frightened
chipmunks
make
haste
to
be
off
but
usually
some
one
is
overtaken
and
knocked
sprawling
with
an
accompanying
rapid
fire
of
denunciation
one
day
i
watched
a
single
harvester
who
was
busily
happily
working
he
cut
off
a
number
of
cones
before
descending
to
gather
them
these
scattered
widely
like
children
playing
one
hid
behind
a
log
another
bounced
into
some
brush
and
stuck
two
feet
above
the
ground
while
two
others
scampered
far
from
the
tree
the
squirrel
went
to
each
in
turn
without
the
least
hesitation
or
search
and
as
though
he
had
been
to
each
spot
a
dozen
times
before
illustration
the
home
of
the
frémont
squirrel
on
the
little
cimarron
a
squirrel
often
displays
oddities
both
in
the
place
selected
for
storing
the
cones
and
the
manner
of
their
arrangement
usually
the
cones
are
wisely
hoarded
both
for
curing
and
for
preservation
by
being
stored
a
few
in
a
place
this
may
be
beneath
a
living
tree
or
in
an
open
space
placed
one
layer
deep
in
the
loose
forest
litter
scarcely
below
the
general
level
of
the
surface
they
are
also
stowed
both
in
and
upon
old
logs
and
stumps
sometimes
they
are
placed
in
little
nests
with
a
or
so
cones
each
often
there
are
a
dozen
of
these
in
a
square
yard
this
scattering
of
the
cones
together
with
the
bringing
of
each
into
contact
with
dry
foreign
substances
secures
ventilation
and
assists
the
sappy
cones
to
dry
and
cure
if
closely
piled
many
of
these
moist
cones
would
be
lost
through
mould
and
decay
the
numbers
of
cones
hoarded
for
winter
by
each
squirrel
varies
with
different
winters
and
also
with
individuals
i
have
many
times
counted
upwards
of
two
hundred
per
squirrel
during
years
of
scanty
the
squirrels
claim
the
entire
crop
the
outcry
raised
against
the
squirrel
for
preventing
far
extension
by
consuming
all
the
seeds
is
i
think
in
the
same
class
as
the
cry
against
the
woodpecker
it
appears
a
cry
raised
by
those
who
see
only
the
harm
without
the
accompanying
good
the
fact
is
that
many
of
the
cones
are
never
eaten
more
are
stored
than
are
wanted
some
are
forgotten
while
others
are
left
by
the
death
of
the
squirrel
thus
many
are
stored
and
left
uneaten
in
places
where
they
are
likely
to
germinate
and
produce
trees
john
muir
too
believes
that
the
douglas
and
frémont
squirrels
are
beneficial
to
commonly
the
cones
are
stored
in
the
same
place
year
after
year
in
dining
also
the
squirrel
uses
a
log
limb
or
stump
year
after
year
thus
bushels
of
the
slowly
decaying
scales
and
cobs
accumulate
in
one
place
it
is
not
uncommon
for
these
accumulations
to
cover
a
square
rod
to
the
depth
of
two
feet
i
know
of
a
few
instances
in
which
squirrels
stowed
cones
in
the
edge
of
a
brook
beneath
the
water
one
of
these
places
being
near
my
cabin
i
kept
track
of
it
until
the
cones
were
used
which
was
in
the
spring
in
early
autumn
the
cones
were
frozen
in
and
there
they
remained
unvisited
i
think
until
the
of
the
ice
in
april
then
a
squirrel
appeared
to
drag
them
from
their
cold
storage
he
carried
each
by
to
his
regular
clasping
the
cone
vertically
base
up
in
his
fore
paws
he
snipped
off
the
scales
and
ate
the
seeds
beneath
in
regular
order
turning
the
cone
as
he
proceeded
as
though
it
were
an
ear
of
corn
and
he
were
eating
the
kernels
i
have
often
waited
to
see
a
squirrel
go
for
something
to
eat
after
a
snowstorm
this
he
did
in
a
way
without
hunting
or
hesitation
he
went
hopping
across
the
snow
to
a
spot
immediately
above
his
supplies
where
he
at
once
pawed
his
way
down
into
the
snow
and
came
up
with
a
cone
in
rambling
the
woods
i
have
often
heard
these
squirrels
barking
and
chickareeing
with
wild
hilarity
apparently
from
the
pure
joy
of
living
then
again
they
proclaimed
my
distant
approach
or
presence
with
unnecessary
vigor
the
energetic
protest
they
make
against
the
trespasser
in
their
woods
is
often
if
not
always
taken
by
big
game
as
a
warning
generally
on
hearing
this
the
game
will
be
all
alert
for
some
seconds
and
occasionally
will
move
off
to
a
more
commanding
position
sometimes
birds
will
stop
and
listen
when
this
sentinel
shouts
warnings
which
have
often
saved
big
game
from
being
shot
most
hunters
hate
this
squirrel
there
are
brief
periods
in
winter
when
these
squirrels
disappear
for
days
at
a
time
the
kind
of
weather
does
not
appear
to
be
a
determining
factor
in
this
during
this
disappearance
they
probably
take
a
hibernating
sleep
anyway
i
have
in
a
few
cases
seen
them
so
soundly
asleep
that
the
fall
and
fracture
of
their
tree
did
not
awaken
them
they
sometimes
live
temporarily
at
least
in
holes
in
the
ground
but
the
home
is
usually
in
a
hollow
limb
or
a
cavern
in
a
well
toward
the
top
of
the
tree
commonly
four
young
ones
are
brought
forth
at
a
birth
cunning
happy
midgets
they
are
when
first
beginning
their
acquaintance
with
the
wooded
world
and
taking
sun
baths
on
a
high
limb
of
their
house
tree
just
how
long
they
live
no
one
appears
to
know
as
pets
they
have
been
kept
for
ten
years
a
pair
lived
near
my
cabin
for
eight
years
then
disappeared
whether
they
migrated
or
met
a
violent
death
i
never
knew
there
was
another
pair
in
the
grove
that
i
kept
track
of
through
eleven
years
this
grove
was
a
one
of
about
ten
acres
that
stood
between
two
brooks
with
but
few
exceptions
the
trees
were
pine
my
acquaintance
with
the
pair
began
one
day
in
early
autumn
both
set
up
such
a
wild
chatter
as
i
approached
the
grove
that
i
first
thought
that
something
was
attacking
them
seated
upon
a
log
close
to
the
tree
which
they
occupied
i
watched
them
for
three
or
four
hours
they
in
turn
watched
me
failing
to
dislodge
me
by
vehement
denunciation
they
quieted
down
and
eyed
me
with
intense
curiosity
i
sat
perfectly
still
evidently
they
were
greatly
puzzled
and
unable
to
make
out
what
i
was
and
what
of
all
things
on
earth
it
could
be
that
i
wanted
with
beady
eyes
they
stared
at
me
from
a
number
of
positions
in
several
trees
occasionally
in
the
midst
of
this
silent
eager
eying
one
would
break
out
in
a
and
drawling
bark
that
was
unconsciously
nervously
repeated
at
brief
intervals
the
next
day
they
silently
allowed
me
to
take
a
seat
after
a
brief
stare
they
grew
bold
with
curiosity
and
descended
to
the
earth
for
a
closer
investigation
pausing
for
a
sharp
look
both
suddenly
exploded
with
wild
chatter
and
fled
with
a
retchy
barking
to
the
in
less
than
a
month
they
took
peanuts
from
my
fingers
they
were
easily
terrified
by
a
loud
noise
or
sudden
movement
one
day
an
acquaintance
came
to
see
me
while
i
was
in
the
grove
with
the
squirrels
by
way
of
heralding
his
approach
he
flung
a
club
which
fell
with
a
crash
upon
a
brush
pile
alongside
these
most
nervous
fellows
they
fled
in
terror
and
it
was
two
or
three
days
before
they
would
come
near
me
again
one
year
the
grove
was
a
total
failure
as
a
result
and
frémont
temporarily
abandoned
their
old
home
and
moved
to
new
quarters
on
a
mountainside
about
half
a
mile
distant
the
day
they
moved
i
was
by
the
brook
watching
a
when
they
chanced
to
cross
on
a
fallen
log
in
passing
one
paused
to
give
a
hasty
chattery
bark
of
recognition
they
hastened
across
the
grassy
open
beyond
as
though
they
felt
themselves
in
danger
when
out
of
the
woods
they
made
a
home
in
an
old
snag
using
places
that
were
i
think
formerly
used
by
woodpeckers
the
afternoon
of
their
arrival
they
commenced
to
harvest
cones
which
were
abundant
on
the
spruce
trees
around
them
i
often
wondered
if
they
made
a
preliminary
trip
and
located
a
before
moving
or
if
they
simply
started
forth
and
stopped
at
the
first
favorable
place
the
following
summer
they
returned
to
their
old
quarters
in
the
grove
the
first
time
that
i
saw
them
they
were
sitting
upon
a
log
daintily
making
a
breakfast
of
fresh
mushrooms
they
often
ate
the
inner
bark
of
pine
twigs
and
once
i
saw
one
of
them
eating
wild
raspberries
i
never
saw
these
or
any
frémont
squirrel
robbing
or
trying
to
rob
a
bird
nest
and
as
i
have
never
noticed
a
bird
disturbed
by
their
presence
i
believe
they
are
not
guilty
of
this
serious
offense
as
are
most
kinds
of
squirrels
through
eleven
years
i
occasionally
fed
them
apparently
at
the
time
of
our
first
meeting
they
were
active
and
agile
to
the
last
after
eleven
years
they
showed
but
few
and
minor
signs
of
aging
one
was
shot
by
a
visitor
while
i
was
dismissing
the
gunner
my
attention
was
attracted
by
the
wailing
of
her
mate
when
he
found
her
lifeless
body
his
grief
was
most
pitiful
among
wild
birds
and
animals
i
have
never
seen
anything
so
pathetic
almost
humanly
he
stared
at
his
mate
he
fondled
her
and
tried
to
coax
her
back
to
life
at
times
almost
pleading
and
wailing
when
i
carried
her
off
for
burial
he
sat
moveless
and
dazed
the
following
day
i
searched
the
grove
whistling
and
calling
but
i
never
saw
him
again

enjoying
its

to

have
made

changes

many
of

are
largely
due

this

two
hundred

of

during
the
past
two

beginning

have
been
no
less
than
seven
forest
fires
two
of

appear
to
have
swept
over
most
of

there
probably
were
other
fires
the
records
of
which
have
vanished
the
dates
of
these
scourges
and
in
many
cases
the
extent
of
their
ravages
were
burned
into
the
annual
rings
of
a
number
of

which
escaped
with
their
lives
and
lived
on
carrying
these
down
to
us
these
fires
together
with
the
erosion
which
followed
had
something
to
do
with
the
topography
and
the
scenery
of
this

there
are
a
few
ugly
scars
from
recent
fires

most
of
the

were
reforested

reasonable
promptness

crags
however
may
have
lost
for
centuries
their
trees
and
vegetation
other
areas
though
losing
trees
gained
in

i
am
strongly
inclined
to
ascribe
much
of
the
openness
the
existence
even
of
estes
allen

to
repeated
fires
some
of
which
probably
were
severe
thus
we
may
look
down
from
the
heights
and
enjoy
the
mingling
beauty
and
grandeur
of
forest

still
realize
that

all
its
destructiveness
may
help
to
make
