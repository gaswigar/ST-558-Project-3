chapter
i
lost
in
the
big
city
it
was
early
spring
a
warm
sun
shone
down
upon
the
city
street
on
the
edge
of
the
narrow
brick
sidewalk
a
little
girl
was
sitting
her
gingham
dress
was
old
and
shabby
the
short
brown
coat
had
lost
all
its
buttons
and
a
rusty
pin
held
it
together
a
faded
blue
cap
partly
covered
her
brown
hair
which
hung
in
short
loose
curls
around
her
face
she
had
been
sitting
there
almost
an
hour
when
a
policeman
came
along
i
wonder
where
that
girl
belongs
he
said
as
he
looked
down
at
her
she
is
a
new
one
on
chambers
street
he
walked
on
but
he
looked
back
as
he
walked
to
see
if
she
went
away
the
child
slowly
raised
her
big
brown
eyes
to
look
after
him
she
watched
him
till
he
reached
the
corner
by
the
meat
shop
then
she
looked
down
and
began
to
kick
at
the
stones
with
her
thin
boots
at
this
moment
a
bell
rang
a
door
opened
in
a
building
across
the
street
and
many
children
came
out
as
they
passed
the
little
girl
some
of
them
looked
at
her
one
little
boy
bent
down
to
see
her
face
but
she
hid
it
under
her
arm
what
are
you
afraid
of
he
asked
who
going
to
hurt
you
she
did
not
answer
another
boy
opened
his
lunch
box
as
he
passed
and
shook
out
the
pieces
of
bread
left
from
his
lunch
soon
the
children
were
gone
and
the
street
was
quiet
again
the
little
girl
kicked
at
the
stones
a
few
minutes
then
she
looked
up
no
one
was
looking
at
her
so
she
reached
out
one
little
hand
and
picked
up
a
crust
of
bread
in
a
wink
the
bread
was
in
her
mouth
she
reached
out
for
another
brushed
off
a
little
dirt
and
ate
that
also
just
then
the
policeman
came
down
the
street
from
the
other
corner
the
child
quickly
bent
her
head
and
looked
down
this
time
he
came
to
where
she
sat
and
stopped
are
you
going
to
sit
here
all
day
little
girl
he
asked
she
did
not
answer

mother

be
looking
for
you

better
run
home
now
like
a
good
girl
where
do
you

bent
down
and
lifted
her
chin
so
she
had
to
look
up
at
him
where

a

girl
at

about

he
waited
for

she
said

will
find
a
tongue
down
there
as
he
spoke
he
took
hold
of
her
arm
to
help
her
up
then
he
tried
one
more
question
what
is
your
name
my
name
is
clematis
as
she
spoke
she
moved
her
arm
and
out
from
the
coat
peeped
a
kitten

was
white
with
a
black
spot
over
one
eye
there
that

the
policeman
now

bent
down
lower
to

her
reply

the
policeman
lifted
her
gently
to
her
feet
well
miss
we
wo
stay
here
any
longer
it
is
getting
late
just
then
the
kitten
stuck
its
head
out
from
her
coat
and
said
miew
it
seemed
very
glad
to
move
on
what
that
now
a
cat
where
did
you
get
that
it
is
my
kitty
my
very

steal
it

name
is
deborah
and
it
is
my
very
own
ah
now
she
is
finding
her
tongue
said
the
policeman
smiling
while
clematis
hugged
the
kitten
but
the
little
girl
could
tell
him
no
more
so
he
led
her
along
the
street
toward
the
police
station
before
they
had
gone
very
far
they
passed
a
baker
shop
in
the
window
were
rolls
and
cookies
and
buns
and
little
cakes
with
jam
and
frosting
on
them
the
smell
of
fresh
bread
came
through
the
door
what
is
the
matter
miss
the
man
looked
down
as
clematis
stood
still
before
the
window
she
was
looking
through
the
glass
at
the
rolls
and
cakes
and
cookies
illustration
i
do
want
to
stay
here
if
you
are
going
to
throw
my
cat
away
the
policeman
smelled
the
fresh
bread
and
it
made
him
hungry
are
you
hungry
little
girl
he
asked
looking
down
with
a
smile
would
you
be
hungry
if
you
had
had
anything
to
eat
all
day
long
clematis
looked
up
at
him
with
tears
in
her
big
brown
eyes
nothing
to
eat
all
day
why
you
must
be
nearly
starved
as
he
spoke
the
policeman
started
into
the
store
pulling
clematis
after
him
she
was
so
surprised
that
she
almost
dropped
her
kitten
miew
said
poor
deborah
as
if
she
knew
they
were
going
to
starve
no
longer
but
it
was
really
because
she
was
squeezed
so
tight
she
could
help
it
now
miss
clematis
do
you
see
anything
there
you
like
jim
cunneen
smiled
down
at
clematis
as
she
peeped
through
the
glass
case
at
the
things
inside
she
stood
silent
with
her
nose
right
against
the
glass
there
were
so
many
things
to
eat
it
almost
took
her
breath
away
well
what
do
you
say
little
girl
do
you
see
anything
you
like
may
i
choose
anything
i
want
yes
miss
just
pick
out
what
you
like
best
the
lady
behind
the
counter
smiled
as
the
policeman
lifted
clematis
a
little
so
she
could
see
better
there
were
cakes
and
cookies
and
buns
and
doughnuts
may
i
have
a
cream
cake
asked
clematis
of
course
you
may
what
else
he
lifted
her
a
bit
higher
miew
said
deborah
from
under
her
coat
oh
excuse
me
cat
he
said
as
he
set
clematis
down
i
forgot
you
were
there
too
the
woman
laughed
as
she
took
out
a
cream
cake
a
cookie
with
nuts
on
it
and
a
doughnut
may
i
eat
them
now
asked
clematis
as
she
took
the
bag
you
start
right
in
and
if
that
not
enough
you
can
have
more
but
do
forget
the
cat
jim
cunneen
laughed
with
the
baker
woman
while
clematis
began
to
eat
the
doughnut
as
they
started
out
before
long
they
came
to
a
brick
building
that
had
big
doors
here
we
are
said
the
policeman
they
turned
and
went
inside
there
another
policeman
was
sitting
at
a
desk
behind
a
railing
well
who
comes
here
asked
the
policeman
at
the
desk
that
is
more
than
i
know
replied
jim
cunneen
i
guess
she
lost
out
of
the
flower
show
she
says
her
name
is
clematis
clematis
said
nothing
her
mouth
was
full
of
cream
cake
now
and
a
little
cream
was
running
over
her
fingers
deborah
was
silent
also
she
was
eating
the
last
crumbs
of
the
doughnut
is
that
all
you
could
find
out
the
other
man
looked
at
clematis
she
says
she
has
no
father
and
no
mother
her
cat
is
named
deborah
that
is
all
she
told
me
oh
well
i
guess
you
scared
her
jim
let
me
ask
her
i
find
out
the
new
policeman
smiled
at
clematis
come
on
now
sister
he
said
tell
us
where
you
live
that
a
good
girl
clematis
reached
up
one
hand
and
took
hold
of
her
friend
big
finger
she
looked
at
the
new
policeman
a
moment
if
you
did
know
where
you
lived
how
could
you
tell
anyone
she
said
jim
cunneen
laughed
he
liked
to
feel
her
little
hand
see
how
scared
she
is
of
me
he
said
we
are
old
friends
now
again
they
asked
the
little
girl
all
the
questions
they
could
think
of
but
it
was
of
no
use
she
could
not
tell
them
where
she
lived
she
would
not
tell
them
very
much
about
herself
at
last
the
captain
came
in
they
told
him
about
this
queer
little
girl
he
asked
her
questions
also
then
he
said
we
shall
have
to
send
her
to
the
home
if
anyone
claims
her
he
can
find
her
there
so
clematis
and
deborah
were
tucked
into
the
big
station
wagon
and
jim
cunneen
took
her
to
the
home
where
lost
children
are
sheltered
and
fed
chapter
ii
the
children
home
as
they
climbed
the
steps
leading
to
the
home
clematis
looked
up
at
the
policeman
what
is
this
place
she
asked
this
is
the
children
home
miss
you
will
have
a
fine
time
here
a
young
woman
with
a
kind
face
opened
the
door
the
policeman
did
not
go
in
here
is
a
child
i
found
on
chambers
street
he
said
we

said
the
woman
could
you
take
her
in

a
while
till

can
find
her
parents
yes
i
guess
we
have
room
for
her
come
in
little
girl
at
that
moment
there
was
a
scratching
sound
and
deborah
stuck
her
head
out
miew
said
deborah
who
was
still
hungry
perhaps
she
thought
it
was
another
bakery
dear
me
cried
the
young
woman
we
ca
have
that
cat
in
here
clematis
drew
back
and
reached
for
jim
cunneen
hand
it
a
very
nice
cat
i
sure
said
the
policeman
he
felt
sorry
for
clematis
he
knew
how
she
loved
her
kitten
but
it
against
the
rules
the
children
can
never
have
cats
or
dogs
in
here
clematis
with
tears
in
her
eyes
turned
away
come
on
she
said
to
her
big
friend
let
us
go
but
jim
cunneen
drew
her
back
he
loved
little
girls
and
was
also
fond
of
cats
do
you
think
the
cook
might
need
it
for
a
day
or
two
to
catch
the
rats
he
asked
with
his
best
smile
oh
dear
me
i
do
know
i
do
think
so
it
against
the
rules
for
children
to
bring
in
pets
ah
then
just
wait
a
minute
i
be
right
back
the
policeman
ran
down
the
steps
and
around
the
corner
of
the
house
while
the
young
woman
asked
clematis
questions
it
all
right
then
i
sure
he
called
as
he
came
back
katie
says
she
would
be
very
glad
to
have
that
cat
to
help
her
catch
the
rats
the
young
woman
laughed
clematis
dried
her
tears
and
jim
cunneen
waved
his
hand
and
said
goodby
in
another
moment
the
door
opened
and
clematis
with
deborah
still
in
her
arms
was
in
her
new
home
it
was

a
small
yellow
bowl
and
a
spoon
beside

a
blue
gingham
bib
jane
one
of

girls
in

the
bowls
on
her
table
with
milk
from
a
big

pitcher
two
little
girls
worked
at
each
of
the

while

filled
the
bowls
the
other
brought
the
bread
she
put
two
thick
slices
of
bread
and
a
big
cookie
on
each
plate
the
young
woman
who

a
tramping
of
many
feet
sounded
in
the
long
hall
the
doors
of
the
dining
room
were
opened
and
mrs
snow
came
in
followed
by
a
double
line
of
little
girls
each
girl
knew
just
where
to
find
her
place
and
stood
waiting
for
the
signal
to
sit
a
teacher
stood
at
the
head
of
each
table
and
beside
miss
rose
was
the
little
stranger
mrs
snow
was
the
housemother
she
asked
the
blessing
while
every
little
girl
bowed
her
head
clematis
stared
about
at
the
other
children
all
this
time
and
wondered
what
they
were
doing
now
they
were
seated
and
each
girl
buttoned
her
bib
in
place
before
she
tasted
her
supper
sally
sat
next
to
clematis
they
gave
you
a

nice
clean
apron
like

you

a
little
girl
across
the
table
who
had
short
straight
hair
clematis
soft
brown
curls
were
neatly
brushed
and
tied
with
a
dark
red
ribbon
she
did
not
look
much
like
the
child
who
came
in
an
hour
before
what
her
name
asked
jane
looking
at
miss
rose
we
ask
her

the
little
girl

up
at
miss
rose
and
said

my
kitty
name

deborah
just
as
she
said
this
a
very
strange
noise

eating
miss
rose
turned
red
and
mrs
snow
looked
up
in
surprise
miew

a
kitten
with
a
black
spot
over

eye

hugging
deborah
tightly
to
her
breast
the
tears
were
running
down
her
cheeks
as

chapter
iii
the
first
night
supper
was
soon
finished
with
many
giggles
from
the
little
girls
who
hoped
that
deborah
would
get
in
again
clematis
ate
every
crumb
of
her
bread
and
cookie
her
yellow
bowl
looked
as
if
deborah
had
lapped
it
dry
after
supper
we
play
games
it
great
fun
said
sally
as
they
were
folding
their
bibs
the
bell
rang
and
the
long
line
of
children
formed
once
more
they
marched
out
through
the
long
hall
up
the
broad
stairs
to
the
play
room
there
were
little
tables
with
low
chairs
to
match
some
of
the
tables
held
games
in
one
corner
of
the
room
was
a
great
doll
house
that
a
rich
lady
had
given
to
the
home
in
another
corner
was
a
small
wooden
swing
with
two
seats
a
rocking
horse
stood
near
the
window
and
a
box
of
bean
bags
lay
on
a
low
shelf
near
by
soon
all
were
playing
happily
except
clematis
who
stood
near
the
window
she
was
looking
at
the
trees
which
were
sending
out
red
buds
the
sun
had
set
and
the
sky
was
rosy
with
the
last
light
of
day
do
you
want
to
play
asked
miss
rose
coming
across
the
room
clematis
shook
her
head
what
would
you
like
to
do
dear
clematis
thought
a
moment
i
should
like
to
help
katie
in
the
kitchen
she
must
need
some
little
girl
miss
rose
smiled
if
clematis
can
get
down
into
the
kitchen
she
can
see
her
kitten
she
thought
she
is
a
sly
little
puss
herself
i
do
think
you
could
go
down
tonight
but
if
you
are
a
good
girl
i
am
sure
katie
will
want
you
to
help
her
before
long
clematis
smiled
come
now
and
i
will
ask
jane
to
show
you
the
doll
house
so
the
little
girls
took
clematis
over
to
the
doll
house
that
stood
in
the
corner
jane
opened
the
front
door
so
they
could
look
in
and
see
four
pretty
rooms
lace
curtains
hung
at
the
tiny
windows
new
rugs
were
on
the
floors
there
was
a
tiny
kitchen
with
a
tiny
stove
and
tiny
kettles
all
just
like
your
own
house
it
was
enough
to
make
any
girl
happy
it
was
so
much
fun
that
clematis
forgot
to
be
sad
and
was
not
ready
to
leave
the
doll
house
when
the
bell
rang
once
more
it
was
bedtime
that
is
the
sleepy
bell
said
jane
closing
the
door
to
the
doll
house
and
running
toward
the
stairs
clematis
was
at
the
end
of
the
row
as
the
girls
went
out
of
the
playroom
and
miss
rose
spoke
as
she
passed
through
the
door
i
will
show
you
where
you
are
to
sleep
my
dear
you
go
with
the
other
children
and
i
come
in
a
few
minutes
clematis
followed
the
other
children
up
the
stairs
to
the
sleeping
rooms
miss
rose
soon
came
and
together
they
went
to
the
room
at
the
end
of
the
hall
how
sweet
that
room
looked
to
the
tired
little
stranger
a
white
iron
bed
stood
against
the
wall
near
the
window
a
small
table
held
a
wash
basin
and
pitcher
there
was
a
cup
and
soap
dish
too
two
clean
towels
hung
near
by
best
of
all
was
the
little
white
bureau
with
a
mirror
the
mirror
had
a
white
frame
there
was
a
pink
rug
before
the
bureau
and
beside
the
bureau
was
a
white
chair
oh
my
cried
clematis
see
the
flowers
on
the
wall
the
pink
wall
paper
was
covered
with
white
roses
and
their
green
leaves
miss
rose
took
a
white
nightdress
from
the
bureau
and
laid
it
on
the
bed
now
clematis
i
shall
give
you
just
ten
minutes
to
undress
when
i
come
back
i
want
you
to
be
all
ready
for
me
miss
rose
went
out
and
clematis
started
on
her
shoes
i
guess
she
do
know
how
fast
i
can
undress
she
said
to
herself
when
miss
rose
came
back
in
ten
minutes
she
found
clematis
already
in
bed
and
half
asleep
why
clematis
this
will
never
do
miss
rose
pulled
back
the
sheet
and
made
clematis
sit
up
there
beside
the
bed
was
a
pile
of
clothes
there
were
the
stockings
just
as
she
had
pulled
them
off
the
boots
were
thrown
down
on
the
clean
gingham
dress
and
the
fresh
apron
was
sadly
crushed
i
am
sorry
little
girl
said
miss
rose
but
you
will
have
to
get
right
up
why
asked
clematis
no
little
girl
can
go
to
bed
without
washing
her
face
and
hands
no
little
girl
can
leave
her
clothes
like
this
is
this
my
room
said
clematis
slowly
getting
out
of
bed
it
is
for
tonight
we
always
let
a
new
child
sleep
alone
the
first
night
was
i
quick
in
getting
into
bed
why
must
i
get
up
look
dear
look
at
that
pile
of
clothes
oh
i
always
leave
them
there
replied
clematis
then
i
know
just
where
to
find
them
in
the
morning
we
do
do
so
here
clematis
now
please
pick
up
the
clothes
fold
them
and
put
them
on
the
chair
then
put
your
boots
under
the
chair
and
take
off
your
pretty
hair
ribbon
clematis
gathered
the
clothes
together
but
she
was
not
happy
i
know
you
are
tired
dear
but
i
am
tired
too
and
we
must
do
things
right
even
if
we
are
tired
now
i
must
show
you
how
to
wash
and
brush
your
teeth
and
then
have
you
say
your
prayers
before
i
can
leave
you
oh
bother
sighed
clematis
no
we
must
say
words
like
that
come
now
we
will
get
washed
miss
rose
poured
some
water
from
the
pitcher
and
made
clematis
wash
her
hands
and
arms
and
face
carefully
then
she
took
a
toothbrush
from
a
box
and
gave
it
to
her
what
is
this
for
asked
clematis
why
dear
answered
miss
rose
in
surprise
that
is
a
tooth
brush
a
tooth
brush
why
there
is
no
hair
on
my
teeth
miss
rose
laughed
no
dear
perhaps
not
but
we
must
brush
them
carefully
each
night
with
water
or
they
will
soon
be
aching
will
that
stop
teeth
from
aching
yes
indeed
it
will
help
very
much
to
keep
them
from
aching
all
right
then
clematis
began
to
brush
her
teeth
my
teeth
ached
last
week
i
nearly
died
she
answered
the
teeth
were
cleaned
and
clematis
was
ready
for
bed
now
dear
let
us
say
our
prayers
i
do
know
any
prayers
miss
rose
looked
at
clematis
in
pity
do
you
really
know
any
prayers
at
all
would
you
know
any
prayers
if
you
had
never
learned
any
miss
rose
smiled
sadly
well
then
she
said
we
will
learn
the
lord
prayer
and
then
you
will
know
the
most
beautiful
prayer
of
all
they
knelt
down
together
and
clematis
said
over
the
words
after
miss
rose
now
good
night
dear
and
pleasant
dreams
said
miss
rose
as
she
tucked
her
in
good
night
said
clematis
the
door
closed
and
all
was
dark
the
maple
trees
swayed
gently
outside
the
window
they
nodded
to
clematis
as
she
watched
them
with
sleepy
eyes
one
little
star
peeped
in
at
her
through
the
maple
tree
chapter
iv
who
is
clematis
the
bright
sun
was
shining
on
the
red
buds
of
the
maple
tree
when
clematis
woke
the
next
morning
it
was
early
the
rising
bell
had
not
rung
clematis
got
up
and
looked
out
of
the
open
window
she
could
see
nothing
but
houses
across
the
street
but
the
buds
of
the
maple
were
beautiful
in
the
sun
i
wish
i
had
some
of
those
buds
to
put
in
my
room
said
clematis
to
herself
she
took
her
clothes
and
began
to
dress
while
she
was
dressing
she
looked
again
at
the
maple
buds
and
wanted
them
more
than
ever
if
i
reached
out
a
little
way
i
could
get
some
of
those
i
just
know
i
could
she
thought
as
soon
as
she
got
her
shoes
on
she
pushed
the
window
wide
open
she
leaned
out
some
beautiful
buds
were
very
near
but
she
could
not
quite
reach
them
she
leaned
out
a
little
farther
then
she
climbed
upon
the
window
sill
they
were
still
out
of
her
reach
for
a
minute
she
stopped
then
she
put
one
foot
out
in
the
gutter
with
one
hand
she
held
the
blind
and
reached
out
to
the
nearest
branch
at
last
she
had
it
she
drew
it
nearer
and
broke
off
a
piece
with
many
buds
as
the
piece
broke
off
the
branch
flew
back
again
to
its
place
and
clematis
almost
fell
back
through
the
window
to
the
floor
she
patted
the
red
buds
and
made
a
little
bunch
of
them
she
filled
her
cup
with
water
and
put
the
buds
in
it
then
she
put
it
on
the
bureau
clematis
was
looking
proudly
at
them
when
the
door
opened
and
miss
rose
came
in
she
looked
at
clematis
and
then
at
the
buds
why
clematis
she
said
then
she
looked
out
the
window
there
several
feet
beyond
the
window
was
the
broken
end
drops
of
sap
were
running
from
the
white
wood
how
did
you
get
those
buds
asked
miss
rose
i
reached
out
of
the
window
said
clematis
why
was
that
stealing
miss
rose
gasped
clematis
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
climbed
out
of
the
window
and
reached
for
that
branch
clematis
nodded
tears
came
into
her
eyes
she
must
have
done
something
very
wrong
but
she
did
not
know
just
what
was
so
wicked
about
taking
a
small
branch
from
a
maple
tree
i
did
know
it
was
stealing
she
sobbed
it
is
that
clematis
it
is
not
wrong
to
take
a
twig
but
think
of
the
danger
do
you
know
you
might
have
fallen
and
killed
yourself
clematis
wiped
her
eyes
on
her
sleeve
oh
that
nothing
she
said
i
had
hold
of
the
blind
all
the
time
i
could
fall
now
clematis
no
child
ever
did
such
a
thing
before
and
you
must
never
never
do
it
again
do
you
understand
yes
do
you
promise
yes
well
then
let
get
ready
for
breakfast
clematis
washed
her
face
and
hands
brushed
her
hair
and
cleaned
her
teeth
carefully
soon
she
was
ready
to
go
down
stairs
and
took
one
of
the
maple
buds
to
put
in
her
dress
as
they
went
out
miss
rose
saw
that
she
wanted
to
say
something
do
you
want
something
she
said
can
i
help
katie
this
morning
after
breakfast
i
will
ask
mrs
snow
but
breakfast
is
almost
ready
now
just
then
the
breakfast
bell
rang
and
clematis
marched
in
with
the
other
children
she
was
thinking
about
deborah
and
wondering
if
she
had
caught
any
rats
for
breakfast
they
had
baked
apples
oatmeal
with
milk
and
rye
gems
it
did
not
take
them
long
to
eat
this
soon
they
were
through
and
ready
for
the
morning
work
as
they
were
getting
up
mrs
snow
came
to
speak
to
miss
rose
clematis
held
her
breath
when
she
heard
what
was
said
perhaps
this
little
girl
would
like
to
go
down
and
play
with
her
kitten
a
while
we
can
find
some
work
for
her
by
and
by
oh
yes
said
clematis
i
would
well
you
can
tell
katie
i
said
you
might
be
sure
not
to
get
in
her
way
off
ran
clematis
to
the
kitchen
to
find
her
dear
deborah
there
she
was
curled
up
like
a
little
ball
under
the
stove
she
looked
with
sleepy
eyes
at
clematis
and
crawled
down
into
her
lap
then
clematis
smoothed
her
and
patted
her
till
she
purred
her
very
sweetest
purr
ah
said
katie
it
a
fine
cat
it
caught
a
big
rat
in
the
night
and
brought
it
in
as
proud
as
pie
do
you
think
they
will
let
me
keep
her
asked
clematis
oh
i
guess
so
if
she
catches
the
rats
she
will
be
welcome
here
you
can
be
sure
of
that
i
hate
rats
while
clematis
and
deborah
were
having
such
a
good
time
in
the
kitchen
mrs
snow
took
miss
rose
to
her
room
well
miss
rose
have
you
found
out
anything
about
that
strange
little
child
not
very
much
yet
she
talks
very
little
and
has
had
very
little
care
what
makes
you
think
so
why
the
poor
child
did
know
what
a
tooth
brush
was
for
she
said
she
always
left
her
clothes
in
a
pile
by
the
bed
because
she
could
find
them
all
in
the
morning
mrs
snow
sighed
dear
me
she
will
need
much
care
to
teach
her
how
to
do
things
well
but
i
guess
her
folks
will
come
for
her
before
long
i
do
know
who
her
folks
can
be
she
has
never
learned
any
prayers
poor
child
she
must
be
a
sad
case
mrs
snow
sighed
again
but
she
is
very
fearless
this
morning
before
i
went
to
her
room
she
had
climbed
out
of
the
window
and
broken
off
a
piece
of
the
maple
tree
with
buds
on
it
what
way
up
there
at
the
roof
yes
she
said
that
was
nothing
for
she
had
hold
of
the
blind
what
did
she
want
the
branch
for
she
wanted
it
for
the
red
buds
she
broke
them
off
and
put
them
in
her
cup
like
flowers
well
miss
rose
take
her
out
to
walk
this
afternoon
and
ask
her
some
questions
perhaps
you
can
find
out
where
she
lives
chapter
v
clematis
begins
to
learn
clematis
played
with
deborah
all
the
morning
she
forgot
about
helping
katie
and
when
katie
asked
her
if
she
wanted
to
help
her
peel
some
potatoes
she
said

katie

some
work
round
here
it
lucky
for
you
that
mrs
snow
is
good
to
little
girls
you
would
have
a
hard
row
to
hoe
in
some
homes
believe
me
clematis
was
busy
tying
her
hair
ribbon
round
deborah
neck
and
did
not
answer
the
morning
went
fast
and
the
dinner
was
ready
before
clematis
was
ready
to
leave
her
kitten
for
dinner
they
had
soup
in
the
little
yellow
bowls
with
a
big
piece
of
johnny
cake
and
some
ginger
bread
as
soon
as
dinner
was
over
miss
rose
brought
clematis
a
brown
coat
it
was
not
new
but
it
was
neat
and
warm
much
better
than
the
one
she
had
worn
the
day
before
come
clematis
she
said
i
am
going
out
to
walk
do
you
want
to
go
with
me
where
are
you
going
asked
clematis
shrinking
back
oh
out
in
the
park
and
down
by
the
river
i
think
you
will
like
it
clematis
put
on
the
coat
as
quickly
as
she
could
then
she
took
miss
rose
by
the
hand
come
on
let
go
she
said
you
might
wait
till
i
get
my
coat
and
hat
on
miss
rose
was
laughing
at
her
soon
they
were
down
by
the
river
miss
rose
sat
on
the
gravel
while
clematis
ran
along
the
edge
of
the
water
she
sailed
bits
of
wood
for
boats
and
threw
little
stones
in
to
see
the
rings
they
made
she
was
very
very
happy
clematis
said
miss
rose
do
you
remember
the
street
you
lived
on
clematis
thought
a
minute
how
would
you
know
the
street
you
lived
on
if
nobody
ever
told
you
miss
rose
thought
a
moment
do
you
remember
your
mother
name
clematis
shook
her
head
i
do
remember
it
was
a
long
time
ago
do
you
mean
she
died
a
long
time
ago
miss
rose
asked
her
some
other
questions
at
last
she
said
well
tell
me
the
name
of
the
man
you
lived
with
his
name
was
smith
oh
dear
there
are
so
many
smiths
we
shall
never
guess
the
right
one
dear
me
clematis
i
do
know
how
we
shall
ever
find
your
home
clematis
threw
a
big
stone
into
the
water
which
made
a
big
splash
i
hope
you
never
will
she
said
why
clematis
do
you
mean
that
you
wish
never
to
go
back
where
you
came
from
well
how
would
you
like
to
live
in
a
place
where
you
had
to
stay
in
an
old
brick
yard
all
day
and
never
saw
even
grass
illustration
thinking
of
the
land
of
flowers
miss
rose
thought
a
while
then
she
got
up
and
started
back
to
the
home
clematis
followed
her
slowly
she
was
sorry
to
go
that
night
mrs
snow
talked
with
miss
rose
again
she
must
have
lived
in
the
city
said
miss
rose
she
had
to
stay
in
a
yard
paved
with
bricks
all
day
she
does
remember
her
parents
at
all
she
ran
away
that
is
sure
i
hardly
know
what
to
do
said
mrs
snow
at
last
she
can
stay
here
for
a
while
and
perhaps
the
people
she
lived
with
will
find
her
here
so
mrs
snow
told
the
policeman
what
they
had
found
out
and
he
said
they
would
do
the
best
they
could
to
find
her
people
that
night
clematis
did
not
go
to
the
little
room
near
the
maple
tree
to
sleep
she
went
into
the
big
room
jane
slept
in
the
bed
next
to
hers
miss
rose
told
her
to
see
that
clematis
had
what
help
she
needed
in
going
to
bed
the
day
had
been
a
busy
one
for
clematis
she
was
very
sleepy
i
guess
i
wo
bother
with
teeth
and
things
tonight
she
said
to
herself
so
she
pulled
off
her
clothes
and
got
into
bed
oh
clematis
you
ca
do
that
you
got
to
pick
up
your
clothes
and
clean
your
teeth
and
do
lots
of
things
jane
came
and
shook
her
as
she
snuggled
under
the
clothes
oh
i
too
tired
tonight
i
do
it
tomorrow
night
clematis
did
not
stir
just
then
miss
rose
came
into
the
sleeping
room
she
saw
jane
trying
to
get
clematis
out
of
bed
she
also
saw
the
pile
of
clothes
clematis
i
ca
have
this
get
right
out
of
bed
and
do
as
i
told
you
last
night
she
wanted
children
to
obey
her
and
she
had
tried
to
be
very
kind
to
clematis
the
other
children
giggled
as
clematis
got
slowly
out
of
bed
but
miss
rose
frowned
at
them
you
see
that
she
does
every
single
thing
she
ought
said
miss
rose
to
jane
and
if
she
does
you
tell
me
then
miss
rose
went
away
and
left
the
girls
to
get
ready
for
bed
poor
clematis
had
a
hard
time
of
it
the
other
girls
made
fun
of
her
because
she
was
so
clumsy
and
slow
at
last
she
got
her
clothes
folded
up
and
went
to
she
is
washing
her
neck
and
ears
said
jane
to
herself
but
i
guess
i
wo
tell
so
at
last
clematis
got
into
bed
again
and
went
to
sleep
chapter
vi
clematis
has
a
hard
row
to
hoe
it
was
all
jane
could
do
the
next
morning
to
make
clematis
get
up
when
the
rising
bell
rang
i
do
want
to
get
up
yet
grumbled
clematis
i
will

pretty
soon
no
you
wo

you
get
up
right
off
now
we
have
to
be
ready
for
breakfast
in
fifteen
minutes
jane
pulled
down
the
clothes
while
the
other
girls
laughed
poor
clematis
had
to
get
up
at
first
she
was
cross
but
when
she
looked
out
of
the
window
she
smiled
from
this
window
she
could
see
way
off
to
a
beautiful
hill
golden
brown
in
the
morning
sun
part
way
to
the
hill
was
a
river
its
little
waves
shimmered
and
danced
its
shores
were
quite
green
already
now
clematis
was
wide
awake
and
happy
she
started
to
dress
wash
first
said
jane
clematis
started
to
grumble
again
but
when
she
looked
into
the
mirror
above
the
wash
stand
there
was
the
river
smiling
at
her
in
the
mirror
she
knew
this
river
she
had
been
there
perhaps
she
would
go
again
some
day
for
breakfast
they
had
a
bowl
of
oatmeal
and
milk
with
two
slices
of
bread
clematis
looked
around
while
they
were
eating
do
you
ever
get
a
cup
of
coffee
for
breakfast
she
asked
of
sally
who
sat
next
to
her
oh
no
never
but
sometimes
we
have
cocoa
on
real
cold
mornings
clematis
turned
up
her
nose
a
little
she
did
not
care
much
for
oatmeal
i
like
doughnuts
and
coffee
a
great
deal
better
she
said
huh

wo
have
any
doughnuts
and
coffee
round
here
said
jane
you
better
eat
what
you
have
clematis
took
her
advice
and
had
just
finished
her
bread
when
the
bell
sounded
now
clematis
said
miss
rose

are
going
to
stay
here
for
a
while
anyway
so
you
must
take
your
part
in
the
daily

been
thinking
of
deborah
and
longing
to
see
her
well
let
go
down
and
see
what
katie
can
find
for
you
to
do
there
was
deborah
sleeping
under
the
edge
of
the
stove
clematis
took
her
while
miss
rose
was
asking

little
girl

she
would
like
to
have
some
work
down

up
she
did
not
feel
very
happy

you
think
she
could
help
you
miss
rose
looked
surprised
no
miss
she

to

potatoes
but
she
never
lifted
a
finger
she
said
she
did
know
how

surprised

clematis

i
think
i

her
head
and
buried
her
face
in
deborah
soft
fur

miss
she
of

caught
a
big
rat
in
the
night
well
then
clematis
we
shall
have
to
ask
mrs
snow
to
find
you
something
else
to
do
clematis
dropped
her
kitten
and
the
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
as
she
followed
miss
rose
upstairs
katie
looked
after
her
with
a
sad
smile
she
have
a
hard
row
to
hoe
round
here
believe
me
she
said
to
herself
mrs
snow
frowned
when
miss
rose
told
her
i
am
very
sorry
she
said
she
may
work
with
jane
then
in
the
dormitory
jane
is
a
good
worker
and
can
teach
her
poor
clematis
was
rather
frightened
when
she
heard
that
she
was
to
work
in
the
dormitory
she
was
afraid
a
dormitory
was
some
dark
place
like
a
prison
she
did
not
know
that
the
dormitory
was
the
big
room
where
she
had
slept
soon
clematis
was
back
in
the
big
room
again
there
she
took
the
place
of
another
little
girl
who
was
making
up
the
beds
with
jane
hurry
up
now
said
jane
we
have
got
to
get
these
beds
all
made
up
before
nine
school
begins
then
she
showed
clematis
how
to
tuck
the
sheet
in
down
at
the
foot
and
pull
it
up
smooth
at
the
head
of
the
bed
clematis
was
looking
out
of
the
window
way
over
the
river
to
the
sunny
brown
hill
there
now
why
do
you
look
out
said
jane
for
clematis
had
given
such
a
pull
that
she
pulled
all
the
clothes
out
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
i
was
looking
out
so
there
said
clematis
yes
looking
out
of
the
window
that
all
jane
was
vexed
now
hurry
up
and
get
them
tucked
in
again
but
clematis
was
very
clumsy
and
not
very
willing
she
had
never
had
to
make
beds
before
she
did
see
any
need
of
it
why
ca
you
leave
the
blankets
till
you
go
to
bed
and
then
just
pull
them
up
she
said
pouting
because
you
ca
that
why
and
you
better
try
or
never
get
a
chance
to
go
to
the
country
what
do
you
mean
who
goes
to
the
country
clematis
came
round
the
bed
and
took
jane
by
the
arm
why
most
of
the
children
who
do
well
or
try
hard
to
do
well
go
to
the
country
for
two
weeks
in
the
summer
to
the
country
where
the
flowers
grow
and
where
there
is
grass
all
around
sure
and
where
they
give
you
milk
and
apple
pie
oh
apple
pie
even
for
breakfast
and
doughnuts
between
meals
i
had
doughnuts
every
day
crickety
said
clematis
you
better
not
let
miss
rose
hear
you
say
that
and
you
worry
you
wo
go
to
any
country
when
you
ca
even
make
beds
clematis
gave
jane
a
frightened
look
and
started
to
work
the
best
she
knew
how
but
the
best
clematis
knew
how
was
very
poor
work
and
by
the
time
the
bell
rang
for
school
one
bed
still
had
to
be
done
let
it
alone
said
jane
i
can
make
it
up
faster
myself
her
hands
and
feet
moved
fast
enough
to
surprise
little
clematis
who
followed
her
friend
down
to
the
school
room
wondering
how
long
it
would
take
her
to
learn
to
make
beds
chapter
vii
what
clematis
found
school
began
with
music
and
miss
rose
went
to
the
piano
the
minute
she
began
to
play
clematis
stood
up
and
stared
at
her
sit
down
do
stand
up
now
jane
pulled
her
sleeve
but
clematis
paid
no
attention
she
kept
her
eyes
on
the
piano
and
seemed
to
hear
nothing
else
the
song
was
of
spring
of
birds
and
brooks
and
flowers
clematis
listened
to
every
word
and
when
it
was
finished
she
sat
down
with
a
sigh
after
the
singing
they
had
a
class
in
reading
clematis
stared
at
the
words
on
the
blackboard
but
could
not
tell
any
of
them
have
you
learned
any
of
your
letters
asked
miss
rose
no
said
clematis
the
other
children
giggled
for
clematis
was
as
large
as
jane
jane
was
eight
and
could
read
very
well
tomorrow
you
must
go
into
the
special
class
and
you
must
work
hard
and
catch
up
as
fast
as
you
can
yes
clematis
was
angry
she
did
like
to
be
laughed
at
at
recess
all
the
children
ran
out
into
the
yard
to
play
it
was
a
large
yard
with
a
high
wooden
fence
around
it
glad
to
be
free
jane
ran
off
to
find
some
chums
and
left
clematis
to
play
by
herself
so
clematis
wandered
round
by
the
fence
till
she
came
to
a
sunny
spot
near
the
big
maple
tree
with
the
red
buds
here
she
picked
up
a
dead
twig
and
sat
down
turning
over
the
dried
leaves
with
the
twig
and
throwing
them
in
the
air
as
she
picked
up
the
leaves
she
saw
some
blades
of
grass
beneath
them
then
she
picked
up
more
leaves
and
found
many
blades
of
grass
growing
beneath
their
warm
shelter
clematis
got
up
and
walked
near
the
fence
where
the
leaves
were
thicker
there
she
poked
them
away
and
found
longer
blades
of
grass
and
new
leaves
green
and
shiny
oh
she
said
to
herself
i
hope
i
can
come
out
here
every
day
then
she
stopped
she
pushed
away
some
more
leaves
she
looked
around
at
the
other
children
none
of
them
were
looking
at
her
she
stooped
and
took
something
from
under
the
pile
of
leaves
again
she
looked
about
but
nobody
was
paying
attention
to
her
all
the
children
were
playing
games
then
a
sound
made
her
look
up
it
was
the
bell
recess
was
over
and
all
the
children
were
going
in
clematis
put
her
hand
into
her
apron
pocket
quickly
and
followed
the
other
children
back
to
school
how
has
the
new
girl
done
today
asked
mrs
snow
just
before
they
sat
down
to
dinner
she
seems
to
feel
more
at
home
replied
miss
rose
she
know
her
letters
yet
i
guess
she
has
grown
up
all
by
herself
that
is
too
bad
i
will
give
her
a
test
this
afternoon
about
three
if
she
would
like
to
play
with
her
kitten
in
the
playroom
for
an
hour
after
dinner
she
may
do
so
oh
i
am
sure
she
would
be
glad
to
see
her
kitten
she
is
a
queer
child
at
recess
she
stole
away
all
by
herself
to
play
by
the
fence
the
children
were
coming
in
now
and
mrs
snow
nodded
to
miss
rose
as
she
went
to
her
chair
little
sally
had
been
just
behind
miss
rose
as
she
said
the
last
words
to
mrs
snow
she
heard
part
of
the
words
she
said
and
began
to
whisper
to
her
neighbor
she
said
somebody
stole
something
it
must
be
that
new
girl
see
how
queer
she
looks
then
of
course
the
neighbor
had
to
whisper
to
the
girl
next
to
her
do
you
know
what
it
was
the
new
girl
stole
see
how
funny
she
looks
she
better
not
steal
anything
of
mine
in
a
minute
clematis
knew
they
were
talking
about
her
she
know
what
it
was
but
she
knew
it
was
unkind
they
were
looking
at
her
and
talking
to
each
other
her
face
turned
red
she
could
not
eat
one
hand
went
deep
into
her
apron
pocket
miss
rose
quickly
saw
that
something
was
wrong
she
knew
that
little
girls
often
made
fun
of
the
strangers
and
it
vexed
her
any
little
girl
who
is
not
polite
she
said
may
leave
the
table
at
once
the
girls
stopped
talking
but
they
poked
each
other
with
their
feet
under
the
table
they
were
sure
clematis
had
stolen
something
for
she
looked
just
as
if
she
had
come
clematis
eat
your
dinner
now
yes
said
clematis
but
it
was
hard
to
swallow
the
bread
she
drank
the
soup
and
left
most
of
the
bread
by
her
bowl
as
soon
as
the
bell
rang
miss
rose
beckoned
to
her
would
you
like
to
take
deborah
to
the
playroom
for
a
while
and
play
with
her
there
clematis
looked
very
much
surprised
she
had
expected
some
new
trouble
oh
yes
she
gasped
and
started
down
to
the
kitchen
glad
to
get
away
from
the
other
girls
who
had
been
watching
then
miss
rose
beckoned
to
jane
jane
what
were
the
girls
saying
about
clematis
at
the
table
jane
hung
her
head
she
did
not
like
to
repeat
such
awful
things
about
clematis
for
she
really
liked
her
though
it
was
hard
to
teach
her
to
work
tell
me
jane
miss
rose
wants
to
know
the
girls
were
saying
she
stole
something
stole
something
why
what
did
she
steal
jane
i
do
know
i
just
heard
them
saying
she
had
stolen
something
she
looked
just
as
if
she
had
very
well
thank
you
jane
jane
went
down
to
the
school
room
where
all
the
girls
were
eager
to
know
what
clematis
had
stolen
but
jane
could
tell
them
nothing
she
just
asked
me
what
you
said
jane
declared
that
just
like
jane
cried
sally
she
knows
all
the
time
only
she
wo
tell
while
they
were
talking
clematis
was
finding
a
cosy
corner
in
the
playroom
and
smoothing
out
every
hair
on
deborah
smooth
back
deborah
seemed
very
happy
and
purred
all
the
time
i
do
care
if
they
do
say
mean
things
and
make
noses
at
me
you
wo
ever
will
you
debby
purr
purr
purr
said
deborah
no
indeed
she
never
would
time
went
fast
and
it
was
three
before
clematis
had
got
deborah
settled
down
for
sleep
in
a
little
bed
she
made
for
her
beneath
the
window
take
her
downstairs
now
clematis
said
miss
rose
coming
in
then
come
up
to
mrs
snow
room
we
want
to
ask
you
some
questions
again
clematis
turned
red
she
went
slowly
downstairs
with
deborah
under
one
arm
the
other
hand
deep
in
her
apron
pocket
she
surely
looks
as
if
something
were
wrong
thought
miss
rose
as
clematis
disappeared
clematis
looked
very
unhappy
when
she
went
to
mrs
snow
room
come
in
little
girl
said
mrs
snow
kindly
there
are
some
things
i
want
to
ask
you
about
yes
replied
clematis
her
lips
quivering
first
i
want
to
know
what
all
this
talk
is
about
some
of
the
girls
were
saying
that
you
took
something
which
did
not
belong
to
you
can
that
be
true
clematis
hung
her
head
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
do
cry
clematis
said
miss
rose
just
tell
mrs
snow
what
it
is
and
perhaps
we
can
make
it
all
right
again
what
was
it
little
girl
asked
mrs
snow
as
she
drew
her
nearer
it
was
mine
i
found
it
first
sobbed
clematis
yes
but
you
must
remember
that
if
we
find
a
thing
that
does
not
make
it
ours
we
must
find
the
true
owner
and
give
it
back
that
is
the
only
honest
thing
to
do
what
was
it
you
found
asked
miss
rose
i
do
where
did
you
find
it
by
the
where
is
it
now
clematis
mrs
snow
spoke
kindly
as
she
wiped
the
child
face
with
her
handkerchief
it
in
my
pocket
answered
clematis
she
drew
out
her
closed
hand
held
it
before
the
two
ladies
and
slowly
opened
it
within
lay
a
limp
withered
dandelion
blossom
chapter
viii
a
visitor
mrs
snow
still
tells
the
story
of
how
clematis
stole
the
first
dandelion
of
the
springtime
out
under
the
leaves
people
laugh
when
they
hear
the
story
you
see
it
all
came
about
because
the
children
told
tales
on
each
other
and
it
was
a
good
joke
on
them
but
as
clematis
stood
there
before
mrs
snow
and
miss
rose
she
did
see
the
joke
at
all
she
cried
and
hid
her
face
in
her
arms
come
here
dear
said
mrs
snow
it
is
all
right
and
you
shall
have
every
dandelion
you
find
in
the
yard
was
it
stealing
sobbed
clematis
no
it
was
all
right
if
you
found
it
first
and
can
i
have
all
i
find
first
yes
indeed
you
can
clematis
lifted
her
head
and
wiped
the
tears
from
her
eyes
oh
she
said
and
seemed
happy
once
more
she
smoothed
the
limp
little
flower
in
her
hot
hand
and
now
said
mrs
snow
i
wonder
if
you
can
tell
us
some
more
about
yourself
yes
i
tell
you
all
you
ask
and
i
wo
tell
any
lies
i
sure
you
wo
perhaps
you
can
remember
now
where
you
lived
before
you
came
here
clematis
shook
her
head
i
told
miss
rose
every
single
thing
she
said
except
except
what
except
that
i
ran
away
clematis
hung
her
head
again
why
did
you
run
away
well
would
you
run
away
if
you
had
to
stay
in
a
yard
all
day
that
was
nothing
but
bricks
mrs
snow
smiled
perhaps
i
would
she
replied
did
you
ever
go
out
at
all
asked
miss
rose
who
had
been
listening
just
sometimes
to
go
over
to
the
store
just
across
the
street
and
back
and
that
was
all
bricks
too
illustration
clematis
held
out
her
hand
do
you
think
you
could
find
your
way
home
again
if
miss
rose
went
with
you
clematis
shook
her
head
oh
no
it
was
a
long
long
way
i
was
most
dead
from
walking
mrs
snow
thought
a
moment
then
she
said
miss
rose
tells
me
that
you
have
not
learned
to
read
is
that
true
yes
i
never
learned
to
do
anything
except
count
the
change
i
got
but
i
can
learn
to
read
and
do
numbers
too
clematis
spoke
without
sobbing
now
she
was
thinking
of
the
country
where
girls
went
who
did
well
do
you
think
you
could
take
her
in
a
class
by
herself
for
a
short
time
mrs
snow
asked
turning
to
miss
rose
miss
rose
was
about
to
answer
when
one
of
the
older
girls
came
to
the
door
what
is
it
ruth
please
mrs
snow
a
man
wants
to
see
you
what
is
his
name
his
name
is
smith
he
wants
to
see
you
about
a
little
girl
as
she
said
this
miss
rose
looked
up
quickly
clematis
also
looked
up
her
face
turned
red
and
she
put
a
finger
in
her
mouth
tell
him
to
come
in
here
in
another
minute
a
small
thin
man
walked
in
he
was
poorly
dressed
and
looked
as
if
he
had
been
did
you
wish
to
see
me
about
one
of
the
children
asked
mrs
snow
yes
marm
about
this
little
girl
right
here
the
man
turned
and
smiled
at
clematis
who
was
standing
close
by
miss
rose
hello
clematis
i
thought
i
should
find
you
somewhere
clematis
smiled
too
but
she
did
not
speak
oh
said
mrs
snow
are
you
the
one
who
took
care
of
this
little
girl
yes
marm
i
had
her
ever
since
she
was
a
little
baby
mrs
snow
thought
a
minute
i
suppose
you
want
to
take
her
home
with
you
i
do
know
about
that
i
have
no
home
to
keep
a
child
in
and
do
right
by
her
you
see
my
wife
is
sick
most
of
the
time
do
you
know
any
of
her
folks
who
could
care
for
her
no
marm
her
mother
came
to
our
house
when
clematis
was
a
tiny
baby
she
said
the
father
was
dead
then
she
died
too
and
we
could
never
find
out
who
she
was
do
you
know
her
last
name
asked
miss
rose
no
miss
we
never
knew
her
last
name
she
said
it
was
jones
but
we
never
believed
that
was
the
truth
this
little
girl
we
just
called
clematis
did
she
have
anything
to
help
you
find
out
who
she
was
asked
mrs
snow
in
surprise
not
a
single
thing
except
this
picture
the
man
took
out
a
small
photograph
it
showed
three
girls
standing
together
in
front
of
a
brick
building
that
is
her
mother
on
the
left
marm
but
i
do
see
how
the
picture
helps
very
much
that
is
true
still
the
picture
is
better
than
nothing
that
is
just
what
we
thought
marm
smith
replied
we
kept
her
along
hoping
we
should
find
some
one
to
claim
her
but
no
one
came
she
is
too
big
for
us
to
care
for
now
then
you
are
ready
to
give
her
up
yes
marm
if
you
will
care
for
her
she
is
very
restless
and
always
wanting
to
run
off
mrs
snow
turned
to
clematis
do
you
think
you
would
rather
stay
here
than
go
back
with
mr
smith
yes
said
clematis
quickly
she
had
been
thinking
of
the
visits
to
the
country
if
she
went
back
to
the
yard
all
made
of
bricks
how
would
she
ever
see
the
grass
and
flowers
very
well
smith
i
think
you
have
done
a
good
deal
to
keep
her
as
long
as
you
have
she
was
well
fed
even
if
she
did
learn
much
thank
you
marm
then
miss
rose
took
clematis
out
of
the
office
while
mrs
snow
talked
with
smith
all
the
afternoon
clematis
wondered
what
they
were
going
to
do
with
her
after
supper
miss
rose
called
to
her
as
the
children
were
going
to
the
playroom
clematis
she
said
do
you
think
that
if
you
stayed
here
you
could
work
real
hard
and
learn
to
do
as
the
other
children
do
yes
very
well
mrs
snow
finds
that
we
can
keep
you
here
i
will
try
to
teach
you
myself
so
you
can
catch
up
with
the
other
children
yes
said
clematis
that
is
all
she
said
but
she
was
so
glad
that
she
could
not
sleep
for
a
long
time
after
she
went
to
bed
she
lay
awake
thinking
and
thinking
of
the
things
she
would
learn
to
do
so
she
might
go
at
last
to
the
country
the
land
of
flowers
and
grass
and
birds
the
land
where
white
clouds
floated
always
in
a
blue
blue
sky
chapter
ix
the
secret
the
next
morning
clematis
did
better
in
helping
jane
with
the
beds
and
before
many
mornings
had
passed
she
learned
so
well
that
miss
rose
praised
her
for
her
work
when
she
wanted
to
stop
trying
and
wanted
to
get
up
without
washing
her
face
and
hands
and
cleaning
her
teeth
she
would
look
out
the
window
at
the
hill
beyond
the
river
it
seemed
to
smile
at
her
and
say
do
forget
the
beautiful
country
little
girl
remember
the
birds
and
the
flowers
do
the
best
you
can
but
there
were
so
many
things
to
do
that
it
seemed
to
poor
clematis
as
if
she
would
never
learn
half
of
them
when
she
tried
to
help
in
setting
the
table
she
dropped
some
plates
she
said
things
that
made
the
other
girls
cross
for
she
had
never
learned
to
play
with
other
girls
and
she
forgot
that
she
could
no
longer
do
just
as
she
pleased
worst
of
all
she
did
not
always
pay
attention
to
study
and
when
miss
rose
left
her
to
do
some
numbers
would
be
looking
out
of
the
window
instead
of
working
on
her
paper
so
the
days
went
on
and
spring
was
almost
over
the
dandelions
had
all
blossomed
and
grown
up
tall
with
white
caps
on
their
heads
and
there
were
no
other
flowers
in
the
yard
one
day
clematis
found
something
which
made
her
almost
as
happy
as
if
she
had
found
some
flowers
at
first
she
thought
she
would
keep
it
a
secret
and
tell
no
one
about
it
then
she
thought
how
good
jane
had
been
to
her
so
she
went
up
to
her
when
she
was
standing
alone
say
jane
if
i
tell
you
a
secret
will
you
promise
not
to
tell
anybody
else
sure
i
promise
said
jane
what
is
it
clematis
looked
around
the
other
children
were
playing
games
come
over
here
she
said
she
led
jane
to
the
big
board
fence
which
stood
at
the
back
of
the
yard
then
she
got
down
on
her
knees
and
took
hold
of
one
of
the
boards
it
was
loose
and
she
could
pull
it
out
see
look
through
there
said
clematis
in
a
low
voice
her
face
shone
with
pleasure
as
she
peeped
through
jane
knelt
down
and
peeped
through
too
beyond
the
fence
she
could
see
into
another
yard
in
this
yard
there
was
grass
growing
and
where
the
flowers
were
beginning
to
grow
up
in
green
shoots
but
this
was
not
all
not
far
from
the
fence
by
a
corner
of
the
garden
stood
a
low
bush
she
could
smell
its
sweet
fragrance
from
where
she
knelt
do
you
see
it
whispered
clematis
of
course
i
see
it
i
can
smell
it
too
it
great
jane
took
in
a
long
breath
of
the
fragrance
and
smiled
at
clematis
oh
i
wish
i
had
some
of
those
blossoms
clematis
looked
eagerly
at
the
blossoms
do
you
know
what
they
are
jane
oh
yes
those
are
lilacs
the
two
girls
had
just
time
to
take
one
more
deep
breath
full
of
the
fragrance
from
the
lilac
blossoms
before
the
bell
rang
jane
kept
her
promise
and
while
the
lilacs
lasted
they
used
to
go
often
to
their
secret
place
and
smell
the
fragrance
of
the
blossoms
the
first
of
july
some
of
the
girls
began
to
start
for
their
vacations
in
the
country
now
it
was
harder
than
ever
for
clematis
to
stick
to
her
work
she
kept
thinking
of
the
beautiful
fields
when
she
should
have
been
thinking
of
numbers
i
do
know
what
we
are
going
to
do
with
you
clematis
said
miss
rose
one
day
you
do
try
hard
sometimes
you
have
learned
to
make
beds
well
you
are
a
good
girl
about
your
clothes
morning
and
night
but
you
are
dreaming
of
other
things
i
fear
what
is
it
you
dream
about
so
much
clematis
thought
a
moment
do
you
think
i
will
have
a
chance
to
go
to
the
country
she
looked
up
at
miss
rose
her
face
was
white
and
anxious
why
clematis
i
do
know
you
would
be
very
much
help
i
am
afraid
you
quarrel
with
the
other
children
and
you
are
very
slow
to
learn
yes
said
clematis
and
hung
her
head
still
said
miss
rose
you
might
have
a
chance
later
if
you
try
hard
i
will
not
forget
you
clematis
tried
to
feel
happier
then
but
there
were
so
many
things
to
learn
and
so
few
days
to
learn
them
in
that
she
hardly
dared
to
hope
very
much
she
found
it
very
hard
to
learn
to
play
happily
with
the
other
children
and
liked
it
much
better
just
to
get
deborah
all
by
herself
and
play
with
her
july
went
by
and
the
children
began
to
come
back
again
they
told
stories
of
the
wonderful
things
they
had
seen
and
now
clematis
was
only
too
glad
to
sit
near
them
and
listen
illustration
clematis
is
better
oh
said
sally
who
had
been
to
maine
lane
had
a
field
almost
as
big
as
a
whole
city
full
of
long
grass
and
daisies
would
he
let
you
pick
the
daisies
asked
clematis
of
course
he
would
all
you
wanted
where
is
maine
asked
clematis
eagerly
hear
her
talk
said
another
girl
named
betty
with
a
sniff
she
need
worry
she
never
get
a
chance
to
pick
any
betty
was
not
very
kind
and
did
not
like
clematis
she
often
made
fun
of
the
younger
children
clematis
turned
red
her
eyes
flashed
and
she
was
about
to
answer
when
the
supper
bell
rang
they
had
just
sat
down
at
the
table
when
betty
said
to
a
girl
near
by
you
ought
to
hear
clematis
she
thinks
she
is
going
to
the
country
just
as
if
anybody
would
have
her
around
betty
sat
next
to
clematis
who
heard
every
word
she
had
tried
to
be
a
good
girl
and
learn
just
as
miss
rose
asked
her
to
her
face
burned
and
her
eyes
flashed
more
than
ever
before
she
stopped
to
think
she
turned
and
waved
her
spoon
before
betty
face
saying
you
ca
stop
me
you
better
keep
quiet
you
old
pig
betty
was
so
startled
that
she
moved
back
her
arm
struck
her
bowl
of
milk
and
the
milk
spilled
out
all
over
the
table
part
of
it
spilled
down
into
her
lap
then
clematis
began
to
cry
when
miss
rose
sent
her
away
from
the
table
and
up
to
her
bed
she
went
willingly
she
was
glad
to
get
away
from
the
other
children
miss
rose
saw
how
sad
she
was
and
knew
how
naughty
betty
had
been
so
she
did
not
punish
her
i
am
very
sorry
you
have
not
learned
to
behave
more
politely
clematis
perhaps
this
will
be
a
lesson
to
you
that
was
all
she
said
before
clematis
went
to
bed
but
clematis
cried
quietly
a
long
long
time
she
felt
that
she
had
made
every
one
look
at
her
right
in
front
of
mrs
snow
what
would
mrs
snow
think
of
her
now
chapter
x
two
doctors
it
was
very
late
before
clematis
fell
asleep
that
night
and
in
the
morning
she
had
a
headache
when
she
got
up
she
had
to
sit
on
the
bed
she
felt
so
dizzy
miss
rose
found
her
sitting
there
why
clematis
she
said
are
you
sick
yes
i
guess
so
whispered
the
poor
little
girl
lie
right
down
again
dear
and
perhaps
you
will
feel
better
they
brought
her
a
cup
of
cocoa
and
some
toast
for
breakfast
but
she
could
not
eat
all
day
she
lay
there
pale
and
sick
in
the
afternoon
old
doctor
field
came
in
to
see
her
he
sat
down
by
the
bed
and
asked
her
some
questions
he
looked
at
her
tongue
and
felt
her
pulse
then
he
took
out
some
little
pills
and
gave
them
to
miss
rose
i
guess
you
had
better
put
her
in
a
single
room
he
said
give
her
some
of
these
in
water
every
two
hours
during
the
day
he
smiled
at
clematis
before
he
went
out
i
guess
she
will
feel
better
in
the
morning
when
i
come
again
but
in
the
morning
clematis
was
not
better
she
was
worse
how
did
she
pass
the
night
asked
doctor
field
as
he
felt
her
pulse
not
very
well
said
miss
rose
she
did
not
sleep
much
and
had
a
good
deal
of
pain
doctor
field
looked
at
her
chest
and
arms
it
might
be
chicken
pox
or
measles
he
said
but
i
do
see
any
of
the
usual
signs
little
clematis
lay
and
looked
at
him
steadily
did
you
want
something
dear
he
asked
i
want
a
drink
she
said
i
want
a
drink
of
cold
cold
water
yes
dear
you
shall
have
a
drink
of
course
you
shall
the
old
doctor
went
into
the
hall
with
miss
rose
she
may
have
a
drink
but
only
a
little
at
a
time
and
i
let
it
be
too
cold
she
really
gets
enough
water
with
her
medicine
soon
they
brought
clematis
a
little
water
in
a
cup
she
raised
her
head
and
drank
it
but
then
made
a
face
and
turned
her
head
away
it
is
any
good
she
said
that
evening
old
doctor
field
came
again
he
looked
carefully
at
clematis
and
shook
his
head
i
guess
it
only
a
slow
fever
it
nothing
catching
he
said
she
be
better
in
a
few
days
the
few
days
passed
but
clematis
was
not
better
at
night
she
was
restless
and
slept
little
even
when
she
did
sleep
her
slumber
was
disturbed
by
bad
dreams
she
talked
to
herself
during
these
dreams
though
people
understand
what
she
said
doctor
field
came
to
see
her
every
day
or
two
but
he
could
not
tell
what
her
sickness
was
he
always
said
just
give
her
the
medicine
as
directed
and
she
will
be
better
soon
miss
rose
had
asked
mrs
snow
if
she
might
take
care
of
her
for
she
had
come
to
love
little
clematis
and
clematis
loved
her
in
return
the
school
work
did
not
take
her
time
very
much
now
so
mrs
snow
was
glad
to
let
miss
rose
care
for
clematis
if
she
stayed
away
very
long
clematis
would
call
for
her
she
wanted
her
in
the
room
mrs
snow
said
miss
rose
one
day
after
clematis
had
been
ill
more
than
two
weeks
i
am
very
anxious
about
clematis
is
she
no
better
no
i
feel
she
is
worse
she
keeps
asking
for
a
cold
drink
of
water
and
says
she
is
burning
up
i
wish
i
dared
give
her
some
and
keep
her
cooler
well
i
think
i
should
follow
the
doctor
directions
it
be
wise
to
do
anything
that
is
not
directed
by
him
do
you
suppose
we
could
have
another
doctor
to
look
at
her
mrs
snow
no
i
fear
not
not
just
now
anyway
miss
rose
went
back
to
the
little
room
upstairs
with
a
sad
heart
she
knew
clematis
was
very
that
night
she
prayed
that
something
might
be
done
for
the
little
sick
girl
and
the
next
morning
she
felt
as
if
her
prayers
had
been
answered
when
doctor
field
came
i
shall
have
to
be
away
for
a
short
time
miss
rose
he
said
after
he
looked
at
clematis
and
felt
her
pulse
a
young
man
doctor
wyatt
will
take
my
place
and
i
am
sure
he
will
do
all
that
can
be
done
can
he
come
today
asked
miss
rose
i
wish
he
could
see
her
soon
i
will
ask
him
i
think
he
will
be
much
interested
in
clematis
i
should
like
to
see
her
well
again
myself
but
i
must
be
out
of
town
a
few
weeks
oh
i
hope
he
will
come
today
and
i
hope
he
will
take
an
interest
in
my
little
girl
said
miss
rose
to
herself
i
know
she
can
be
cured
if
we
only
know
what
is
the
matter
that
afternoon
doctor
wyatt
came
miss
rose
was
glad
when
she
saw
him
for
he
was
so
kind
and
so
wise
that
she
knew
he
would
do
the
best
he
could
the
afternoon
was
hot
and
clematis
was
covered
with
hot
blankets
as
directed
by
doctor
field
wyatt
took
the
blankets
and
threw
them
off
the
poor
child
will
roast
under
those
he
said
then
he
sat
beside
her
and
watched
her
is
there
anything
you
would
like
he
said
at
last
in
a
pleasant
voice
yes
i
want
a
cold
drink
of
water
her
voice
sounded
faint
and
feeble
now
what
does
she
have
to
drink
asked
doctor
wyatt
we
give
her
water
now
and
then
as
directed
by
field
but
we
do
not
give
her
very
much
and
not
very
cold

orange

doctor
wyatt
called
after
her
as
he
saw
that
clematis
had
fixed
her
eye
on
him
clematis
smiled
when
he
said
that
and
turned
toward
him
with
a
sigh
soon
miss
rose
came
back
with
the
glass
wyatt
held
it
to
the
lips
of
the
little
sick
girl
she
drank
slowly
oh

she
whispered
when
he
took
the
glass
away

of
that
whenever

asks
for

long
anxious
night

doctor
wyatt

little
more
comfortable
said
miss
rose
the
doctor
sat
by
her
for
half
an
hour
he
felt
her
pulse
and
looked
her
all
over
then
he
shook
his
head
that
day
he
spent
a
long
time
studying
his
books
in
the
evening
he
came
again
and
sat
by
clematis
he
shook
his
head
sadly
i
must
tell
you
miss

that

a
very
sick
little
girl
he
said
as
they
stood
in
the
hall

anything
for
her
the
tears
sprang
to
her
eyes
perhaps
i
can
if
she
is
no
better
tomorrow
i
shall
feel
very
anxious
again
that
night
the
doctor
spent
a
long
time
over
his
big
books
then
he
went
and
talked
with
doctors
in
the
hospital
i
shall
be
here

of
the
time
tonight
he
said
the
next
morning

her
cool
and
as
comfortable
as
you
can
miss

went
back
to
the
bed
with
aching
heart
oh
if
we
only
knew
what
was
the
matter
with
you
clematis
she
thought
as
she
looked
at
the
little
white
face
in
the
evening
doctor
wyatt
came
back
once
more
now
miss
rose
he
said

doctor
wyatt
sat
down
to
watch
by
clematis
it
was
a
warm
evening
so
he
gave
her
a
drink
and
fanned
her
to
cool
her
hot
face
as
it
grew
late
she
fell
into
a
light
sleep
as
she
slept
she
began
to
talk
in
low
tones
the
doctor
bent
his
head
down
very
near
her
lips
and
listened
carefully
to
everything
she
said
hour
after
hour
he
watched
and
listened
until
he
too
fell
asleep
just
as
the
sun
was
coming
up
miss
rose
found
him
there
in
the
morning
sleeping
in
his
chair
close
by
the
bed
miss
rose
he
asked
as
he
started
up
did
this
little
girl
want
anything
very
much
indeed
yes
she
did
she
wanted
to
go
to
the
country
as
the
other
children
did
but
it
did
not
seem
quite
possible
that
it
that
just
it
exclaimed
doctor
wyatt
she
spoke
of
flowers
of
lilacs
and
daisies
i
could
tell
much
what
she
said
but
i
could
hear
those
words
at
that
moment
clematis
opened
her
eyes
and
stared
about
her
doctor
wyatt
took
one
thin
frail
hand
in
his
big
brown
ones
clematis
he
said
in
a
loud
firm
tone
i
know
a
lovely
place
in
the
country
if
you
will
get
well
you
can
go
there
for
two
whole
weeks
clematis
stared
at
him
but
did
not
seem
to
hear
him
i
want
a
drink
she
said
feebly
he
put
the
glass
to
her
lips
you
can
pick
daisies
and
goldenrod
and
all
sorts
of
flowers
in
the
country
if
you
just
get
well
ca
she
miss
rose
yes
clematis
you
can
miss
rose
tried
to
speak
cheerfully
but
it
was
hard
she
wanted
to
cry
clematis
stared
at
her
also
for
a
minute
and
then
turned
away
i
go
get
some
sleep
now
keep
her
cool
and
comfortable
till
i
come
back

this
evening
the
day
passed
slowly
mrs
snow
came
in
two
or
three
times
to
look
at
clematis
and
feel
her
pulse
some
of
the
other
teachers
came
to
peep
in
also
they
went
away
softly
wiping
their
eyes
she
is
a
queer
little
girl
said
one
but
i
do
love
her
that
is
what
they
all
felt
at
evening
doctor
wyatt
returned
he
looked
anxious
as
he
took
his
seat
beside
the
bed
i
shall
stay
till
about

the
bedside

miss
rose
looked
straight
into
his
face
to
see
just
what
he
meant
yes
miss
rose
there

be
and
i
hope
it
will
be

miss

held
her
breath
a
minute
yes

more
than
all
the
medicine
in
the
world
the
minutes
crept
along
into
hours
and
midnight
passed
while
miss
rose
watched
clematis
seemed
restless
but
she
did
not
talk
to
herself
any
more
miss
rose
held
the
glass
to
her
lips
now
and
then
but
she
did
not
drink
when
miss
rose
wiped
her
face
with
a
cold
wet
cloth
she
smiled
a
faint
little
smile
as
if
she
liked
it
then
the
look
of
pain
would
come
again
as
she
turned
restlessly
the
clock
outside
struck
one
how
slowly
the
minutes
went
at
last
it
struck
two
and
a
breeze
stirred
the
leaves
outside
they
were
the
leaves
of
the
maple
clematis
had
broken
in
the
early
spring
now
they
seemed
to
whisper
softly
to
each
other
all
else
was
silent
miss
rose
had
watched
a
long
time
many
days
she
had
been
by
the
bed
her
eyes
began
to
droop
i
rest
my
head
just
a
minute
she
thought
and
leaned
back
upon
the
chair
slowly
the
clock
struck
three
as
the
last
stroke
came
miss
rose
stirred
and
opened
her
eyes
then
she
started
up
i
must
have
been
asleep
she
said
aloud
oh
shame
on
me
for
sleeping
when
i
promised
to
watch
she
looked
down
at
the
bed
clematis
lay
there
peaceful
and
quiet
her
little
hand
was
white
and
still
as
marble
her
face
seemed
very
happy
all
pain
was
gone
and
a
smile
lay
upon
the
pale
lips
oh
little
clematis
to
think
i
should
have
been
asleep
miss
rose
took
out
her
handkerchief
and
bent
her
head
down
on
the
bed
weeping
a
slight
sound
seemed
to
come
from
the
pillow
miss
rose
looked
up
the
child
eyes
were
open
wide
she
was
looking
at
her
in
wonder
he
said
i
could
go
did
he
said
clematis
in
a
faint
voice
miss
rose
choked
down
her
sobs
yes
yes
clematis
he
did
he
did
well
then
what
are
you
crying
about
clematis
closed
her
eyes
again
and
lay
still
as
before
with
a
little
smile
on
her
lips
miss
rose
was
so
astonished
that
she
sat
staring
at
her
for
some
minutes
until
she
heard
a
step
in
the
hall
it
was
doctor
wyatt
he
came
in
softly
and
looked
at
the
little
figure
on
the
bed
he
felt
her
pulse
and
listened
to
her
heart
then
he
smiled
and
led
miss
rose
from
the
room
she
is
all
right
now
he
whispered
let
her
sleep
as
long
as
she
can

beside
the
bed
and

her
as
she
moved

drink
of
that
orange
juice
miss
rose
brought
a
glass
with
ice
in
it
and
held
it
while
clematis
sipped
it
slowly
then
she
washed
her
face
and
hands
in
cold
water
thanks
the
little
girl
whispered
as
she
turned
on
the
pillow
and
went
off
to
sleep
again
there
was
great
joy
all
through
the
home
for
every
one
knew
that
clematis
was
getting
well
doctor
wyatt
came
every
day
to
look
at
his
little
sick
girl
and
laugh
and
pat
her
cheeks
you
just
wait
till
you
see
the
apple
pies
my
aunt

would
say
then
clematis
would
smile
tell
me
about
the
garden

lilac
blossoms
now
little
sister
but
asters
and
hollyhocks
and
goldenrod
you
just
wait
till
you
see
them
then
the
doctor
would
go
out
with
another
laugh
soon
clematis
got
so
well
that
she
could
sit
up
in
bed
miss
rose
would
sit
by
the
window
sewing
and
sometimes
she
would
read
a
story
one
afternoon
she
saw
that
clematis
was
anxious
about
something
she
had
a
little
wrinkle
in
her
forehead
what
is
it
you
are
thinking
about
is
there
something
you
want
illustration
in
the
country
at
last
miss
rose
went
and
stood
by
the
bed
smoothing
her
forehead
with
her
soft
hand
i
was
thinking
said
clematis
i
was
thinking
that
that
perhaps
i
could
have
deborah
come
to
see
me
just
for
a
minute
well
you
wait
a
minute
and
i
see
miss
rose
went
out
and
clematis
waited
to
hear
her
steps
again
she
had
not
seen
deborah
for
a
long
time
soon
she
heard
miss
rose
coming
back
she
shut
her
eyes
till
the
footsteps
came
up
to
the
bed
and
before
she
opened
them
there
was
a
little
pounce
beside
her
her
dear
deborah
was
rubbing
a
cold
nose
against
her
cheek
and
purring
how
glad
she
was
to
see
her
clematis
smoothed
and
patted
her
a
long
time
as
she
lay
purring
close
by
her
side
after
that
deborah
came
up
often
and
lay
there
on
the
bed
while
miss
rose
sewed
by
the
window
what
are
you
sewing
asked
clematis
one
day
when
she
was
well
enough
to
sit
up
what
do
you
suppose
it
looks
like
a
dress
that
just
what
it
is
it
a
new
dress
for
a
little
girl
to
wear
to
the
country
oh
who
is
going
to
have
it
let
me
see
it
please
hold
it
up
miss
rose
held
the
dress
before
her
it
was
nearly
done
the
skirt
was
of
serge
navy
blue
with
two
pockets
with
it
went
a
middy
blouse
with
white
lacings
at
the
neck
and
white
stars
on
the
sleeves
oh
please
tell
me
who
is
going
to
have
it
the
child
eyes
danced
as
she
saw
the
pretty
dress
i
give
you
just
one
guess
said
miss
rose
smiling
clematis
gasped
could
it
be
for
her
she
had
never
dreamed
of
owning
a
dress
like
that
the
little
girl
sat
there
a
moment
without
speaking
then
she
pointed
one
finger
at
herself
right
the
very
first
time
said
miss
rose
this
blouse
is
to
travel
in
there
is
another
she
reached
down
and
lifted
another
blouse
this
was
white
with
blue
collar
and
cuffs
and
a
blue
star
on
the
sleeve
all
this
was
too
much
for
clematis
the
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
and
she
breathed
fast
but
she
did
not
say
very
much
to
speak
her
gratitude
oh
thanks
was
all
she
said
miss
rose
saw
in
her
face
how
much
it
all
meant
to
her
i
am
proud
of
this
little
patient
said
doctor

would
be
starting
for
the
land
of
her
dreams
she
could
see
great
fields
of
grass
with
daisies
and
clover
already
she
could
see
them
stretching
out
before
her
how
she
got
through
the
days
before
she
was
to
start
she
never
knew
she
was
well

clematis
looked
up
in
surprise
she
never
thought
that
grown
people
wanted
to
go
away
she
did
not
notice
how
pale
and
tired

jerry
was
the
old
cab
man
who
had
a
stand
near
the
school
and
carried
people
to
the
station
this
was
a
new
delight
for
clematis
what
fun
to
ride
to
the
station
with
jerry
in
a
cab
all
day
the
joyful
thoughts
of
her
trip
filled
her
mind
she
could
think
of
nothing
else
the
other
children
laughed
at
her
but
she
never
minded
them
at
all
she
was
going
to
the
country
to
the
birds
and
flowers
and
fields
and
that
was
all
she
cared
but
as
she
was
going
to
bed
one
thought
seemed
to
disturb
her
she
lay
there
thinking
with
the
little
anxious
line
across
her
forehead
a
long
time
she
thought
then
she
spoke
half
aloud
that
just
what
i
do
she
said
i
got
to
anyway
i
care
if
the
blouse
is
crushed
a
little
then
she
went
to
sleep
chapter
xiii
off
for
tilton
the
day
that
she
had
longed
for
came
at
last
the
sun
was
bright
the
breeze
was
cool
and
clematis
was
as
happy
as
the
sparrows
that
hopped
about
in
the
maple
tree
all
the
morning
she
ran
here
and
there
getting
her
things
ready
she
had
a
small
black
bag
and
the
box
miss
rose
left
for
her
extra
blouse
her
things
were
put
into
these
mrs
snow
had
an
early
lunch
for
clematis
because
she
was
going
on
the
one
train
i
would
rather
eat
it
down
in
the
kitchen
with
katie
she
said
when
they
started
to
put
a
bowl
on
the
big
table
katie
was
willing
so
clematis
had
some
bread
and
soup
on
the
corner
of
the
kitchen
table
illustration
with
katie
in
the
kitchen
it
will
be
nearer
the
street
so
i
will
bring

she
said
she
seemed
very
nervous
but
katie
thought
it
was
because
of
her
trip
do
worry
miss
clematis
she
said
jerry
will
soon
be
here
i
know
it
clematis
looked
around
then
she
slipped
out
of
her
chair
and
went
up
to
katie
she
whispered
a
minute
in
her
friendly
ear
oh
now
dearie
i
would
be
doing
that
katie
put
her
hand
on
the
little
girl
cheek
and
shook
her
head
i
do
think
they
would
like
it
but
clematis
was
very
serious
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
as
she
whispered
again
oh
please
please
i
do
know
what
might
happen
well
then
answered
katie
what
i
do
see
i
do
know
about
i
going
upstairs
a
minute
be
quick
now
she
went
upstairs
and
clematis
hurried
into
the
small
room
near
the
kitchen
with
her
box
in
a
minute
she
came
out
again
looking
all
about
when
katie
came
down
she
was
drinking
her
soup
she
could
not
swallow
the
bread
dear
child
said
katie
as
the
bell
rang
i
hope
the
worry
does
make
her
sick
again
jerry
was
ready
with
the
cab
all
aboard
mum
i
take
your
things
he
started
to
take
the
box
which
she
hugged
up
under
one
arm
oh
no
thank
you
she
cried
and
held
on
to
it
tighter
than
ever
katie
gave
him
the
black
bag
she
had
in
her
hand
and
the
next
minute
clematis
was
safe
inside
and
throwing
a
kiss
to
the
friendly
cook
before
he
got
to
the
station
old
jerry
stopped
and
went
into
a
store
he
came
out
with
a
big
paper
bag
katie
told
me
to
get
this
for
you
miss
he
said
as
he
passed
the
bag
to
her
through
the
open
window
she
peeped
inside
there
was
a
smaller
bag
and
several
big
peaches
in
the
smaller
bag
were
sandwiches
and
cream
cakes
what
a
treat
clematis
often
longed
for
peaches
but
had
not
tasted
them
very
often
in
the
station
jerry
got
down
and
led
her
to
the
train
here
is
a
passenger
for
tilton
new
hampshire
he
said
to
the
conductor
all
right
jerry
i
look
after
her
the
big
conductor
smiled
at
the
little
passenger
come
on
sister
he
said
as
he
stooped
to
take
her
box
oh
no
thank
you
said
clematis
hugging
it
closer
than
ever
she
must
have
her
money
in
that
laughed
jerry
so
the
conductor
took
the
two
bags
while
clematis
carried
the
box
he
found
her
a
seat
where
she
could
be
right
by
the
window
soon
the
train
started
they
went
across
bridges
and
through
the
yards
till
at
last
they
came
to
the
open
country
there
clematis
could
see
the
fields
and
the
flowers
which
grew
close
by
the
tracks
as
the
train
flew
on
they
came
to
quiet
woods
with
little
brooks
and
cows
resting
comfortably
in
the
shade
there
was
so
much
to
see
that
clematis
could
not
take
her
face
from
the
window
a
minute
farmers
were
at
work
in
the
fields
of
wheat
and
corn
and
oats
they
were
mowing
and
raking
some
were
throwing
hay
into
the
big
carts
at
last
they
came
to
a
big
river
that
ran
along
by
the
track
clematis
could
see
people
fishing
along
the
banks
and
rowing
on
the
smooth
water
i
hope
there
is
a
river
in
tilton
she
thought
it
was
a
long
time
before
she
thought
of
the
peaches
and
sandwiches
when
she
did
she
knew
she
was
very
hungry
so
she
opened
the
bag
and
ate
while
she
watched
the
river
and
fields
and
forests
one
sandwich
she
broke
in
halves
she
raised
the
cover
of
the
box
a
little
and
put
one
half
inside
then
she
shut
the
cover
and
tied
the
string
tilton
is
the
next
station
said
the
conductor
at
last
they
went
along
beside
a
small
river
across
a
bridge
and
the
train
stopped
at
tilton
i
guess
that
little
girl
is
for
me
said
a
tall
man
with
a
pleasant
face
as
clematis
came
down
the
steps
her
tag
says
alder
on
it
is
that
the
one
asked
the
conductor
that
right
i
told
alder
i
would
bring
her
along
when
i
came
from
the
train
well
here
her
bag
she
wo
let
any
one
touch
her
box
she
keeps
her
money
in
it
goodby
little
girl
too
too
the
whistle
blew
the
wheels
began
to
turn
and
the
long
train
drew
slowly
away
right
over
here
little
girl
climb
right
up
on
the
seat
i
hold
your
box
oh
no
thank
you
said
clematis
i
keep
it
then
she
looked
up
at
the
seat
how
was
she
to
climb
up
there
and
hold
her
box
suddenly
she
was
lifted
off
the
ground
and
found
herself
safe
on
the
high
seat
that
the
way
we
fix
it
said
the
man
with
a
smile
up
you
go
money
box
and
all
now
i
want
to
go
up
the
street
about
a
mile
or
so
before
i
take
you
to
alder
i
do
suppose
you
mind
do
you
clematis
shook
her
head
she
was
happy
at
the
thought
of
another
ride
so
they
drove
up
a
long
hill
as
they
reached
the
top
the
man
stopped
his
horse
and
looked
about
it
pretty
is
it
he
said
clematis
nodded
and
looked
all
about
her
the
hill
sloped
down
again
into
a
little
valley
where
the
brook
ran
between
green
meadows
beyond
that
the
pastures
ran
up
to
meet
the
forest
on
another
hill
looking
past
this
hill
she
could
see
the
blue
waters
of
a
lake
sparkling
in
the
evening
sun
from
the
lake
the
ground
rose
once
more
up
and
up
it
went
with
pastures
and
forests
until
it
came
to
the
rocky
crowns
of
three
mountains
the
mountains
were
a
deep
misty
blue
above
them
rose
the
white
august
clouds
rolling
on
and
on
into
the
highest
heaven
clematis
drew
a
long
breath
it
is
lovely
she
whispered
not
far
from
where
they
stopped
was
a
white
house
with
the
blinds
closed
vines
ran
about
the
front
and
all
seemed
lonely
who
lives
there
she
asked
finding
her
tongue
at
last
no
one
lives
there
now
a
nice
old
man
used
to
live
there
but
he
had
a
good
deal
of
sadness
he
shut
up
the
house
and
went
to
live
in
a
little
place
over
near
bean
hill
he
pointed
over
to
another
hill
which
rose
in
the
east
clematis
would
have
liked
to
know
more
about
the
man
who
could
leave
such
a
lovely
place
but
the
horse
started
on
again
soon
they
turned
into
another
road
and
before
long
were
turning
back
toward
the
village
all
the
way
along
clematis
could
see
the
blue
mountains
in
the
distance
she
could
not
take
her
eyes
from
them
well
there
is
your
house
said
the
man
at
last
pointing
to
a
neat
white
house
clematis
looked
all
about
yes
there
were
gardens
and
flowers
and
fields
and
trees
there
was
a
cow
down
by
a
little
brook
everything
she
had
hoped
to
find
was
there
there
was
a
tall
maple
beside
the
house
well
this
is
clematis
i
guess
said
a
lady
coming
down
the
path
thank
you
very
much
ladd
i
see
she
came
right
side
up
she
took
the
bag
ladd
handed
down
and
reached
for
the
box
that
clematis
still
hugged
in
her
lap
clematis
started
to
explain
but
alder
did
not
wait
she
was
nervous
and
quick
she
pulled
the
box
out
of
her
hands
why
clematis
what
is
in
this
box
alder
looked
at
it
in
surprise
clematis
did
not
answer
she
gasped
and
turned
red
as
a
comb
it
her
money
alder
said
ladd
laughing
she
has
it
tied
up
for
safe
keeping
the
conductor
told
me
so
alder
lifted
one
corner
of
the
box
to
peep
in
there
was
a
scratching
sound
and
then
out
popped
a
little
white
furry
head
with
sharp
ears
and
one
black
eye
it
was
deborah
chapter
xiv
the
country
when
ladd
saw
the
little
white
head
peep
out
he
put
his
head
back
and
laughed
i
pity
the
rats
in
your
barn
now
alder
he
shouted
alder
frowned
at
first
but
when
she
looked
at
clematis
and
saw
her
anxious
face
she
smiled
what
on
earth
made
you
bring
that
cat
way
up
here
she
asked
she
my
own
cat
i
was
afraid
to
leave
her
at
the
home
all
alone
would
you
like
to
leave
your
cat
alone
where
people
might
throw
it
away
while
you
were
gone
just
then
a
tall
man
with
a
gray
beard
walked
up
never
mind
mary
he
said
we
have
plenty
of
milk
in
the
dairy
and
plenty
of
rats
in
the
barn
by
this
time
clematis
had
deborah
safe
in
her
arms
and
alder
led
the
way
to
the
house
while
ladd
drove
off
laughing
as
he
went
well
you
can
take
the
cat
down
to
the
barn
i
wo
have
it
in
the
house
said
alder
all
right
we
find
a
place
for
her
said
alder
he
took
clematis
by
the
hand
and
they
went
down
to
the
barn
a
gray
horse
poked
his
head
from
a
box
stall
to
look
at
the
little
visitor
and
a
little
red
hen
called
her
chickens
and
hastened
away
clucking
as
if
she
were
very
angry
clematis
turned
to
look
at
her
did
you
ever
have
any
chickens
asked
alder
oh
no
i
never
saw
any
clematis
could
not
take
her
eyes
from
the
little
chicks
as
they
ran
after
their
anxious
mother
we
have
lots
of
things
to
show
you
here
let
put
your
cat
up
in
the
loft
now
they
went
up
a
set
of
stairs
and
there
was
a
loft
full
of
sweet
hay
illustration
clematis
stuck
one
hand
out
there
now
tabby
you
will
find
a
good
bed
and
good
hunting
here
her
name
is
tabby
it
deborah
said
clematis
as
she
put
her
down
oh
that
quite
a
name
it
suits
her
very
well
alder
led
the
way
down
again
at
the
other
end
of
the
barn
a
red
and
white
calf
came
up
to
meet
them
it
put
out
its
wet
nose
to
smell
the
little
visitor
and
made
her
start
back
he
wants
to
say
do
he
loves
little
girls
said
alder
clematis
stuck
one
hand
out
timidly
and
pulled
it
back
again
when
the
calf
tried
to
lick
it
with
his
rough
tongue
he
wants
just
a
little
taste
laughed
alder
come
on
now
here
is
something
else
at
the
end
of
the
barn
clematis
could
hear
strange
noises
there
in
the
yard
were
some
smooth
white
animals
running
about
when
clematis
came
near
the
fence
they
ran
and
put
their
fore
feet
up
and
stuck
their
noses
out
uff
uff
they
said
then
they
squealed
oh
i
know
those
are
pigs
cried
clematis
clapping
her
hands
eight
clean
white
pigs
were
grunting
and
squealing
for
their
supper
squeal
away
piggies
said
alder
supper
will
be
along
soon
in
a
moment
he
brought
from
the
dairy
a
bright
milk
pail
then
they
went
down
to
the
gate
and
he
called
come
boss
come
boss
come
betty
a
sleek
plump
cow
came
over
the
hill
and
hurried
down
to
the
gate
it
was
just
the
color
of
a
mouse
dear
old
betty
steady
now
betty
pushed
through
and
walked
fast
to
the
barn
where
she
began
to
whisper
to
her
calf
and
lap
it
with
her
great
rough
tongue
as
clematis
came
up
betty
put
her
head
down
and
shook
her
horns
behave
betty
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
said
alder
you
see
she
wo
let
any
strangers
near
her
calf
then
he
took
some
grain
and
put
it
in
betty
box
while
he
tied
her
head
and
sat
down
on
the
stool
beside
her
clematis
had
never
seen
a
cow
milked
before
and
stood
watching
the
white
streams
which
filled
the
foaming
pail
as
if
alder
were
a
fairy
it
seemed
like
magic
when
the
pail
was
full
alder
poured
some
into
a
shiny
can
and
took
the
rest
to
the
dairy
there
he
poured
it
into
a
red
machine
with
a
big
bowl
he
turned
the
handle
and
soon
two
streams
came
out
what
is
that
for
clematis
thought
this
might
be
some
new
magic
indeed
it
was
magic
almost
this
is
the
separator
answered
alder
i
pour
the
milk
in
at
the
top
and
turn
the
handle
then
the
cream
comes
out
of
one
spout
and
the
skimmed
milk
from
the
other
oh
i
see
said
clematis
though
it
really
was
all
like
magic
to
her
now
i
guess
we
are
through
let
go
up
and
see
what
they
have
for
supper
alder
took
the
empty
pail
and
led
her
back
to
the
house
where
supper
was
ready
and
waiting
the
smell
of
hot
biscuit
made
clematis
feel
very
hungry
and
she
was
glad
that
supper
was
all
ready
with
the
biscuit
was
golden
butter
and
apple
sauce
do
you
like
warm
milk
right
from
the
cow
asked
alder
yes
replied
clematis
with
a
nod
so
alder
put
a
little
pitcher
with
a
glass
not
much
bigger
than
a
thimble
beside
her
plate
she
could
pour
it
out
herself
as
often
as
she
emptied
her
glass
better
leave
room
for
some
fresh
blueberry
pie
and
a
piece
of
cheese
said
alder
illustration
the
little
red
hen
blueberry
pie
and
cheese
hot
biscuit
and
fresh
milk
and
golden
butter
all
she
wanted
surely
sally
never
had
any
supper
better
than
this
the
shadows
were
falling
and
the
august
crickets
were
beginning
their
evening
concert
when
clematis
had
eaten
the
last
bit
of
pie
on
her
plate
the
sand
man
is
coming
i
do
believe
said
alder
as
he
reached
over
to
pinch
her
cheek
well
i
do
wonder
the
trip
was
a
long
one
for
a
little
girl
you
shall
go
right
to
bed
clematis
alder
took
a
lamp
as
she
spoke
and
led
the
little
visitor
to
the
stairs
good
night
sleep
tight
do
let
the
skeeters
bite
alder
called
after
her
as
she
went
up
clematis
laughed
her
eyes
were
drooping
and
her
feet
were
heavy
as
she
climbed
the
stairs
there
now
we
have
you
tucked
in
before
a
cat
can
say
jack
sprat
said
alder
as
she
unbuttoned
her
boots
have
i
got
to
fold
my
clothes
asked
clematis
as
alder
began
picking
them
up
never
mind
about
them
tonight
here
a
wet
cloth
we
just
have
a
quick
wash
and
into
bed
you
go
the
bed
was
soft
the
pillows
were
softer
and
the
song
of
the
evening
breeze
in
the
maple
without
her
open
window
was
softer
still
i
am
in
the
country
sighed
clematis
i
can
hear
the
trees
and
i
can
smell
the
flowers
now
tomorrow
i
will
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
what
she
was
going
to
do
i
ca
for
just
then
she
fell
fast
asleep
chapter
xv
clematis
tries
to
help
the
birds
in
the
maple
tree
woke
clematis
early
the
next
morning
for
a
minute
she
did
not
know
where
she
was
then
she
hopped
out
of
bed
and
ran
to
the
window
the
sun
was
up
the
birds
were
singing
all
about
the
smell
of
clover
and
sweet
grass
came
to
her
open
window
there
across
the
valley
lay
the
mountains
she
saw
in
the
evening
now
they
were
not
blue
she
could
see
the
rocks
and
the
bushes
in
the
morning
light
but
they
were
just
as
lovely
as
before
oh
she
thought
some
day
i
go
and
climb
up
those
mountains
then
she
washed
carefully
at
the
stand
by
the
window
for
she
remembered
what
miss
rose
had
said
when
she
was
dressed
she
started
down
stairs
then
she
thought
again
i
must
help
all
i
can
i
guess
i
make
the
bed
so
she
drew
the
clothes
neatly
over
the
bed
and
smoothed
the
pillow
then
she
went
down
good
morning
clematis
said
alder
i
see
you
get
up
before
breakfast
did
you
have
a
good
sleep
yes
replied
clematis
would
you
like
me
to
help
you
no
you
had
better
run
out
and
see
what
alder
is
doing
you
can
help
me
after
breakfast
so
clematis
ran
out
how
loud
the
birds
sounded
in
the
clear
air
how
they
chirped
and
twittered
how
sweet
the
smell
of
the
flowers
and
how
bright
the
sun
oh
there
the
little
red
hen
she
cried
but
she
has
lost
her
chickens
every
one
is
gone
there
was
the
little
hen
sitting
on
the
ground
near
the
barn
door
just
then
alder
came
out
with
a
pail
of
milk
oh
alder
where
have
all
the
chickens
gone
cried
clematis
he
laughed
dear
me
he
said
i
do
see
them
anywhere
do
you
no
but
they
were
all
here
last
night
i
wonder
if
the
rats
caught
them
alder
looked
very
sad
oh
dear
if
they
did
i
tell
deborah
clematis
looked
as
if
she
were
ready
to
cry
do
cry
i
get
a
fairy
to
bring
them
back
you
turn
around
and
shut
your
eyes
he
turned
her
around
now
are
your
eyes
shut
yes
now
you
must
say
fairy
bring
back
my
chicks
fairy
fairy
bring
back
my
chicks
said
clematis
laughing
she
heard
the
little
red
hen
clucking
behind
her
then
she
heard
the
chickens
peeping
turn
round
said
alder
she
opened
her
eyes
she
turned
around
and
there
were
the
chicks
running
about
their
mother
she
was
just
going
to
cry
out
in
surprise
when
the
hen
lifted
her
wings
and
two
more
ran
out
from
beneath
them
oh
i
know
she
had
them
under
her
feathers
all
the
time
clematis
laughed
and
danced
about
while
the
red
hen
clucked
to
her
chicks
and
walked
off
very
angry
indeed
alder
laughed
also
and
picked
up
the
pail
do
you
see
that
patch
of
raspberries
down
there
just
beyond
the
hen
house
he
asked
clematis
nodded
i
think
there
are
some
big
late
raspberries
down
there
would
you
like
to
pick
a
few
you
find
them
good
for
me
to
eat
yes
eat
all
you
can
find
they
are
good
for
little
city
girls
oh
thank
you
clematis
started
toward
the
patch
of
raspberries
then
she
stopped
i
must
see
deborah
first
she
said
i
wonder
if
she
caught
any
rats
to
be
sure
i
forgot
deborah
give
her
my
love
alder
went
to
separate
his
milk
while
clematis
found
deborah
sound
asleep
on
the
hay
and
ready
to
visit
the
raspberry
patch
soon
the
bell
for
breakfast
rang
and
clematis
ran
to
the
house
her
lips
and
fingers
were
red
with
raspberries
for
she
had
found
big
ones
by
her
plate
was
her
tiny
glass
and
a
pitcher
of
rich
milk
there
were
corn
flakes
and
shredded
wheat
first
and
then
toast
and
bacon
and
big
baked
apples
with
cream
clematis
had
never
really
expected
to
have
such
things
to
eat
the
stories
other
little
girls
had
told
her
all
had
seemed
like
fairy
tales
now
you
can
help
me
a
while
if
you
wish
said
alder
after
breakfast
can
you
wash
dishes
oh
yes
i
can
do
that
all
right
clematis
looked
after
alder
with
longing
eyes
he
was
going
to
feed
the
pigs
she
longed
to
go
too
but
she
knew
she
must
help
all
she
could
so
she
started
in
on
the
plates
and
cups
the
water
was
hot
and
she
found
it
hard
work
to
hold
the
china
just
as
she
was
lifting
a
cup
it
slipped
from
her
hand
snick
gracious
what
was
that
asked
alder
she
thought
a
good
deal
of
her
china
the
cup
was
taken
out
a
piece
was
broken
from
the
edge
oh
dear
me
i
have
had
those
cups
for
twenty
years
i
guess
finish
the
dishes
clematis
said
nothing
but
turned
very
red
she
almost
cried
she
was
so
ashamed
well
do
worry
too
much
about
it
said
alder
you
can
help
me
with
the
beds
i
sure
you
can
make
your
bed
without
doing
any
harm
oh
yes
i
made
it
already

it
already
when
why
when
i
got
up
before
breakfast
mercy
go
right
up
and
pull
the
clothes
back
it
must
always
air
for
an
hour
poor
clematis
went
up
and
pulled
the
clothes
back
to
air
how
can
i
help
if
every
single
thing
i
do
is
wrong
clematis
spoke
crossly
out
the
window
at
the
robin
on
the
edge
of
the
roof
then
she
felt
a
crumb
in
her
pocket
and
pushed
up
the
screen
to
throw
it
out
robin
flew
away
and
alder
came
in
at
that
moment
dear
child
what
on
earth
have
you
put
up
that
screen
for
do
you
want
to
fill
the
house
with
flies
no
i
did
know
oh
well
never
mind
you
do
know
much
i
guess
i
promised
to
take
you
and
i
keep
my
word
but
it
no
use
trying
to
fit
city
children
into
real
homes
alder
shut
the
screen
with
a
bang
there
now
you
run
along
out
doors
i
guess
you
and
alder
will
get
along
all
right
but
do
touch
anything
hello
it
looks
like
rain
what
the
trouble
sister
alder
smiled
and
pinched
her
cheek
as
he
met
clematis
at
the
back
door
i
tried
to
help
said
clematis
drying
her
eyes
oh
i
see
you
did
do
things
quite
right
did
you
well
i
would
fret
about
that
i
do
do
things
quite
right
myself
clematis
smiled
through
her
tears
come
on
now
and
help
me
pick
some
late
peas
for
dinner
you
will
like
that
i
am
sure
he
took
her
hand
and
soon
she
was
happy
again
there
you
picked
two
quarts
and
did
it
well
too
now
take
these
up
to
alder
and
tell
her
you
can
shell
them
out
every
one
without
hurting
a
thing
oh
said
alder
in
the
kitchen

shell
peas
do
you
well
take
them
out
under
the
maple
tree
then
i
have
the
pods
all
around
the
kitchen
and
clematis
proved
that
she
could
shell
peas
after
all
alder
gave
her
a
cookie
for
her
pay
and
said
she
had
done
very
well
i
guess
you
get
along
all
right
if
you
stay
out
doors
she
said
thanks
said
clematis
eating
the
cookie
as
she
went
out
she
was
glad
enough
to
stay
out
doors
illustration
clematis
watched
the
little
fishes
by
the
shore
i
help
alder
all
the
time
she
said
to
herself
i
feed
the
pigs
and
the
hens
and
i
guess
he
be
glad
i
here
chapter
xvi
only
a
few
days
more
clematis
did
help
alder
and
tried
hard
in
her
way
to
make
herself
useful
she
helped
alder
too
for
she
went
on
errands
to
the
village
every
time
she
was
asked
every
day
she
went
to
the
post
office
she
took
home
the
letters
and
carried
home
bundles
from
the
stores
clematis
loved
this
walk
because
the
road
ran
down
by
knapp
saw
mill
and
by
the
river
near
the
stocking
mill
the
river
came
right
up
to
the
road
and
she
could
even
see
the
little
fish
in
the
clear
water
sometimes
she
stopped
longer
than
she
thought
and
was
late
getting
back
but
alder
did
not
scold
her
the
less
we
expect
of
her
the
less
we
shall
be
disappointed
she
would
say
on
sunday
they
all
went
down
to
church
to
hear
sampson
preach
he
smiled
at
her
in
his
kindly
way
when
she
went
out
let
me
see
i
do
know
your
name
do
i
he
asked
taking
her
hand
it
clematis
well
clematis
i
glad
to
see
you
i
hope
you
will
come
again
that
little
girl
looks
just
like
another
little
girl
i
used
to
know
he
said
to
alder
she
is
here
for
a
week
or
two
doctor
wyatt
sent
her
up
alder
whispered
to
him
a
minute
before
they
went
away
how
would
you
like
to
take
a
long
walk
this
afternoon
clematis
said
alder
while
she
was
eating
her
ice
cream
and
cake
oh
yes
let
clematis
was
glad
enough
she
never
liked
sundays
very
well
good
we
can
walk
up
bean
hill
if
you
think
you
can
go
that
far
illustration
she
could
see
the
little
fish
oh
i
can
walk
farther
than
that
so
they
started
out
while
alder
lay
down
for
a
nap
they
did
go
by
the
road
but
crossed
the
river
in
a
boat
that
alder
kept
tied
to
the
bank
then
they
walked
through
the
trees
and
meadows
by
the
path
clematis
was
full
of
joy
new
birds
sang
here
new
trees
and
new
flowers
met
her
at
each
turn
after
they
had
walked
about
a
mile
they
came
to
a
little
cabin
set
among
maple
trees
who
lives
here
asked
clematis
it
looked
like
the
cabins
she
had
seen
in
her
picture
books
no
one
lives
here
now
this
is
where
they
boil
down
their
sap
in
the
spring
they
make
maple
syrup
and
maple
sugar
there
were
the
big
pans
turned
upside
down
and
the
pails
that
caught
the
sap
her
mouth
watered
as
she
thought
of
all
the
maple

they

little
cabin

but
alder
started
on

good
man
who

over
here
on
the
side
of

hill
he
lives
all
alone
by
himself
oh
replied
clematis
is
he
the
man
who
owns
the
white
house
with
the
vines
and
has
had
so
much
sadness
yes
how
did
you
know
about
him
ladd
stopped
near
his
house
he
told
me
the
walk
was
a
long
one
and
clematis
was
glad
when
she
saw
the
little
cottage
on
the
hillside
here
we
are
there
is
brooks
now
working
over
his
flowers
alder
went
over
to
the
little
garden
where
a
man
with
white
hair
was
pulling
out
weeds
good
day
alder
glad
enough
to
see
you
come
up
and
sit
on
the
piazza
brooks
smiled
as
he
wiped
his
hands
and
here
is
a
lady
too
he
added
i
believe
i
have
never
met
her
he
held
out
his
hand
to
clematis
with
a
kindly
smile
and
led
them
to
the
piazza
alder
told
him
who
she
was
while
clematis
was
looking
at
the
neat
little
cottage
a
vine
was
growing
about
the
door
with
little
white
flowers
peeping
out
from
its
green
leaves
brooks
saw
her
looking
at
it
do
you
like
the
flowers
he
asked
yes
it
is
just
the
same
what
do
you
mean
what
is
just
the
same
why
just
the
same
vine
as
the
one
on
the
white
house
she
saw
the
old
home
place
when
she
drove
over
with
ladd
said
alder
she
remembered
the
vine
i
am
glad
you
like
it
you
ought
to
like
it
clematis
because
it
has
your
own
name
added
alder
well
well
is
her
name
clematis
brooks
took
her
on
his
knee
and
looked
into
her
face
i
wish
i
had
a
little
girl
like
you
he
said
she
sat
there
on
his
knee
while
he
talked
with
alder
i
hope
you
will
come
again
clematis
you
will
if
you
get
a
chance
wo
you
brooks
said
as
they
started
to
go
he
brought
out
a
big
sweet
pear
and
put
it
into
her
hand
you
can
eat
that
on
the
way
home
he
said
all
the
way
home
clematis
kept
thinking
of
brooks
and
the
vine
and
how
he
had
looked
into
her
face
while
she
sat
on
his
knee
she
had
never
known
any
father
or
mother
and
people
did
have
time
to
hold
her
that
way
at
the
home
could
we
go
again
she
asked
as
they
crossed
the
river
well
perhaps
we
see
when
they
got
home
alder
was
sitting
on
the
back
steps
beside
her
in
the
grass
lay
three
dead
chickens
how
on
earth
did
those
chickens
get
killed
asked
alder
as
he
took
one
in
his
hand
why
on
earth
did
that
child
ever
bring
her
old
cat
up
here
what
i
like
to
know
alder
was
cross
did
deborah
do
that
dear
me
we
have
to
shut
her
up
in
the
loft
that
where
she
is
and
that
where
she
stay
said
alder
remember
now
clematis
do
you
let
her
get
out
again
yes
said
clematis
she
did
know
what
else
to
say
so
she
went
sadly
to
the
loft
there
she
found
deborah
sleeping
sweetly
as
if
she
had
never
done
a
thing
wrong
in
the
world
she
sat
down
by
the
open
window
and
looked
across
the
river
valley
and
across
the
lake
to
the
mountains
oh
dear
she
sighed
she
heard
alder
speaking
i
do
care
i
think
the
doctor
was
asking
a
good
deal
of
us
to
keep
a
strange
child
like
that
well
mary
never
mind
it
is
only
for
a
few
days
longer
i
guess
we
can
stand
it
think
of
the
pleasure
it
gives
clematis
alder
spoke
kindly
but
as
clematis
heard
the
words
she
turned
pale
only
a
few
days
more
only
a
few
days
more
the
words
went
through
her
mind
again
and
again
she
had
never
thought
about
going
back
two
weeks
seems
a
long
long
time
to
little
girls
only
a
few
days
more
before
she
must
leave
tilton
clematis
put
her
elbows
on
the
window
sill
and
rested
her
chin
in
her
hands
the
sun
was
setting
behind
the
maple
tree
the
golden
rays
gleamed
in
the
white
mist
that
had
risen
from
the
river
for
it
was
a
cold
evening
in
the
distance
the
belmont
mountains
were
a
deep
misty
blue
and
the
clouds
above
them
all
white
and
gold
now
all
the
valley
was
filling
with
a
golden
mist
the
birds
were
singing
in
the
trees
along
the
banks
of
the
river
they
filled
the
evening
air
with
joyous
songs
only
a
few
days
more
only
a
few
days
more
soon
she
must
go
back
to
the
brick
walls
and
the
yard
with
the
high
fence
around
it
when
alder
came
to
call
clematis
for
supper
her
eyes
were
red
and
her
cheeks
pale
never
mind
dear
little
girl
he
said
we
keep
deborah
shut
up
i
guess
we
can
spare
the
chickens
we
have
plenty
more
she
said
nothing
but
went
silently
in
for
the
evening
meal
she
had
forgotten
all
about
the
chickens
all
through
supper
the
words
ran
in
her
head
and
the
last
thing
in
her
mind
as
she
fell
asleep
was
this
thought
only
a
few
days
more
chapter
xvii
where
is
clematis
on
monday
clematis
found
a
big
blue
envelope
with
the
other
mail
i
guess

have
a
letter
for
your
own
self
this
time
said
morse
as
he
handed
her
the
mail
clematis
did
not
stop
to
look
at
the
little
fishes
by
the
shore
she
hurried
straight
home
it
was
a
letter
for
her
own
self
miss

it
to

opened
the
envelope
while

close
to

side

forgiven
you
i
am
going
to
ask
alder
to
send

on
the
afternoon
train
saturday
so
you

all

that

good
letter
for
a
little
girl
to

i
am
sure
now
run
out
and
play
while
i
read
my
letters
clematis
went
out
rather
slowly
the
letter
made
her
think
again
of
the
end
of
her
stay
and
she
was
sad
but
the
sun
was
bright
the
breeze
was
cool
and
the
birds
sang
merrily
she
saw
alder
down
in
the
garden
and
ran
to
him
can
i
help
you
mr
alder
i
think
not
i
am
weeding
late
carrots
and
i
think
you
would
not
know
them
from
weeds
i
should
know
them
honestly
just
let
me
try
a
little
bit
well
then
take
this
little
trowel
make
the
earth
loose
around
them
and
then
pull
the
weeds
out
with
your
fingers
clematis
kneeled
in
the
soft
earth
and
began
to
work
with
the
trowel
she
weeded
the
row
across
from
alder
where
he
could
see
what
she
was
doing
well
i
declare
you
are
a
real
gardener
alder
patted
her
shoulder
and
praised
her
well
when
she
had
done
several
feet
of
her
row
the
little
green
tops
of
the
carrots
all
stood
straight
and
clean
every
weed
was
gone
but
no
carrots
were
hurt
i
told
you
i
could
do
it
you
did
not
believe
me
did
you
clematis
smiled
happily
well
i
do
now
i
never
saw
any
one
do
better
so
the
man
and
the
little
girl
worked
side
by
side
beneath
the
august
sun
the
smell
of
the
warm
earth
and
the
fresh
growing
things
all
around
her
made
clematis
breathe
deeply
she
could
hear
the
birds
singing
and
see
the
mountains
across
the
lakes
while
she
was
hard
at
work
she
almost
forgot
to
be
sad
because
she
was
going
back
on
the
saturday
train
just
look
at
that
child
said
alder
when
they
went
in
to
wash
for
dinner
has
she
been
weeding
in
her
good
clothes
she
has
weeded
two
whole
rows
of
carrots
i
know
that
much
get
her
some
new
clothes
when
those
wear
out
she
is
as
much
help
at
weeding
as
a
man
clematis
was
as
proud
of
that
as
deborah
was
with
her
first
rat
in
the
afternoon
alder
found
her
a
pair
of
small
overalls
these
covered
her
dress
and
kept
her
clean
it
was
a
happy
child
that
came
in
at
evening
she
had
worked
steadily
in
the
hot
sun
and
the
breeze
and
had
finished
all
the
carrots
you
do
know
how
much
help
that
has
been
clematis
said
alder
it
tires
my
back
to
weed
carrots
and
now
they
are
all
done
i
will
weed
tomorrow
too
she
said
happy
with
her
praise
there
was
plenty
to
do
as
there
always
is
on
a
farm
and
clematis
was
busy
all
day
i
do
see
how
she
learns
so
quickly
exclaimed
alder
when
he
was
telling
ladd
about
her
i
suppose
it
is
because
she
naturally
loves
it
he
answered
it
seems
too
bad
that
she
could
live
here
in
the
country
she
seems
to
love
it
so
yes
i
wish
alder
was
better
and
took
to
children
more
clematis
is
clumsy
in
the
house
but
out
in
the
garden
she
is
right
at
home
so
the
days
went
on
with
sunshine
and
clouds
and
saturday
came
nearer
and
nearer
clematis
what
have
you
been
doing
to
the
calendar
in
your
room
asked
alder
at
dinner
on
friday
i
was
just
looking
to
see
how
many
days
till
saturday
well
you
need
muss
it
up
that
way
every
morning
clematis
had
taken
it
down
and
counted
the
days
with
her
fingers
friday
evening
she
did
not
eat
much
supper
and
was
very
silent
longing
to
get
back
home
i
guess
said
alder
well
dear
you
will
be
back
with
the
other
children
tomorrow
i
know
what
it
is
i
was
homesick
myself
when
i
was
a
child
clematis
did
not
answer
she
did
know
how
to
tell
what
it
was
that
troubled
her
so
she
said
nothing
the
stars
were
bright
and
the
tiny
moon
was
low
in
the
sky
before
the
weary
eyes
closed
in
sleep
clematis
had
been
thinking
and
thinking
tomorrow
was
saturday
early
in
the
morning
she
was
awake
again
by
the
window
she
leaned
her
head
on
her
hands
and
began
to
think
again
that
is
what
he
said
she
repeated
half
aloud
that
is
just
what
he
said
if
he
did
mean
it
why
did
he
say
it
at
the
breakfast
table
alder
noticed
how
pale
her
cheeks
were
try
to
eat
some
toast
dear
said
alder
you
will
soon
be
home
again
only
a
few
hours
more
now
clematis
raised
her
eyes
and
gave
alder
a
strange
look
that
child
does
beat
all
said
alder
after
breakfast
she
seems
to
be
thinking
a
lot
but
she
keeps
as
quiet
as
a
stone
jug
she
is
thinking
you
may
be
sure
of
that
alder
replied
all
the
morning
clematis
went
about
silently
except
when
she
was
in
the
loft
with
deborah
then
she
talked
i
sha
be
afraid
i
am
a
big
girl
debby
and
i
sha
be
a
mite
afraid
deborah
could
not
speak
but
she
snuggled
up
close
and
purred
so
clematis
knew
just
what
she
meant
be
sure
to
have
all
your
things
ready
clematis
called
alder
we
shall
have
an
early
dinner
for
ladd

be
here
about
one
to
take
you
to
the
station
yes
said
clematis
and
she
went
slowly
to
her
room
before
long
all
was
ready
and
dinner
was
on
the
table
now
let
eat
a
big
dinner
i
roasted
a
chicken
especially
for
you
how
good
the
roast
chicken
smelled
there
were
baked
potatoes
and
peas
and
beans
too
clematis
was
hungry
now
she
ate
and
ate
and
ate
good
girl
alder
patted
her
on
the
head
travelers
must
be
well
fed
be
sure
to
wash
all
the
blueberry
off
your
mouth
added
alder
as
clematis
got
down
clematis
went
to
the
sink
and
washed
her
face
and
hands
then
she
went
to
the
back
door
do
forget
deborah
satin
dress
and
velvet
hat
called
alder
she
turned
and
smiled
back
at
him
as
she
went
out
soon
ladd
drove
up
i
came
a
bit
early
he
said
i
got
some
milk

the
seminary

guess
she
just
went
out
to

her
cat
alder
went
to
the
back
door
and
called

waited
a
minute
but
clematis

not

called
again

henry
she
said
to
alder
tell
her
to
come
right
in
after
a
few
minutes
alder
came
back
he
looked
puzzled
well
where
is
clematis
asked
alder
i
do
know

in

loft

goodby
to
the
pigs

must
be
around
here
somewhere
she
has
no
wings

fly
i
not
so
sure
of
that
alder
smiled
in
a
puzzled
way
at
ladd
that
just
like
you
men
alder
went
to
the
door
and
called
as
loudly
as
she
could
then
she
went
to
the
barn
and
called
again
she
looked
all
about
alder

myself
alder
replied
i
wonder

can
be

the
next

many
people
came
to
ask
if
clematis
had
been
found
no
no

a
sign
of
her
anywhere
i
do

but
no
clematis
came
with
it
towards
evening
brooks
was
sitting
in
his
chair
by
his
little
cottage
reading
a
book
the
sun
was
sinking
behind
the
mountains
in
the
west
the
birds
were
singing
their
evening
songs
in
the
trees
by
the
brook
all
was
quiet
and
peaceful
as
he
sat
there
brooks
heard
steps
on
the
path
he
looked
down
and
saw
a
little
girl
in
her
arms
was
a
cat
with
a
black
spot
over
one
eye
the
child
stumbled
as
she
walked
she
seemed
ready
to
drop
she
was
so
tired
why
little
girl
where
did
you
come
from
cried
brooks
he
got
up
and
went
down
to
meet
her
then
she
raised
her
pale
face
and
he
saw
that
it
was
clematis
her
face
and
hands
were
soiled
her
hair
was
tangled
her
dress
was
dusty
and
torn
oh

clematis
faintly
i

brooks
when

and
hands
and

he
cut
a
slice
of
bread
on
this
he
spread
some
butter
and
sprinkled
a
little
sugar
clematis
watched
him
with
hungry
eyes
dear
child

must
be
starved
he
said
as
she
took
a
great
bite
would
you
be
hungry
if

had
had
any
breakfast
or

clematis
took
another
big

said
clematis
beginning
on
the
second
slice
brooks
looked
at
her
a
moment
in
silence
while
she
ate
i
never
heard
anything
to
beat
that
he
said
at

as

filled
with
tears

illustration
in
grandfather
house
poor
clematis
she
had
never
said
so
much
at
one
time
in
her
life
then
she
burst
into
tears
she
was
tired
and
worn
and
faint
brooks
took
her
into
his
lap
he
hardly
knew
what
to
say
to
comfort
her
have
you
no
father
or
mother
he
asked
no
she
sobbed
i
have
anybody

all
alone
here
i
have
any
good
place
to
keep
a
little
girl
i
do
care
i
can
sleep
on
the
floor
her
eyes
were
drooping
and
she
was
growing
quiet
her
head
rested
on
his
shoulder
brooks
was
thinking
what
to
say
when
he
looked
down
at
her
face
her
brown
eyes
were
closed
and
she
was
fast
asleep
he
held
her
there
a
while
then
he
took
her
into
the
next
room
and
laid
her
on
the
bed
covered
with
a
warm
blanket
she
sighed
softly
and
sank
into
a
deep
slumber
i
ca
take
her
home
tonight
she
ought
to
have
a
long
quiet
sleep
said
brooks
to
himself
he
watched
her
a
while
then
he
went
out
up
the
mountain
to
giles
house
there
he
telephoned
to
atkinson
store
in
another
minute
a
little
boy
was
racing
up
the
street
he
called
to
every
one
on
his
way
clematis
is
found
clematis
is
found
she
up
on
bean
hill
ned
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
clematis
would
have
been
surprised
if
she
had
seen
how
glad
alder
was
to
know
that
she
was
safe
they
sent
a
message
to
miss
rose
and
told
her
that
clematis
was
found
every
one
was
glad
every
one
asked
how
she
ever
got
way
up
there
on
bean
hill
but
no
one
knew
all
this
time
clematis
was
sleeping
quietly
when
brooks
returned
she
had
not
stirred
he
stood
and
looked
at
her
a
long
long
time
when
he
turned
away
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
poor
little
elf
he
whispered
she
thought
i
meant
just
what
i
said
he
spread
some
blankets
on
the
floor
and
lay
down
but
he
did
not
go
to
sleep
his
thoughts
went
back
to
a
book
he
had
been
reading
it
was
about
silas
marner
a
man
who
was
sad
and
lonely
silas
marner
took
a
little
girl
into
his
tiny
house
to
care
for
and
she
made
his
life
happy
again
silas
marner
did
not
have
so
large
a
home
as
this
he
thought
but
he
took
good
care
of
the
little
girl
how
happy
they
were
together
the
little
face
all
wet
with
tears
came
before
him
again
and
again
i
might
keep
her
for
a
little
while
at
least
he
said
to
himself
i
will
see
what
alder
thinks
in
the
morning
chapter
xix
new
plans
when
brooks
woke
in
the
morning
clematis
was
already
up
she
had
washed
her
face
and
hands
at
the
spring
near
the
door
and
was
sitting
on
the
step
oho
so
the
little
bird
woke
first
did
she
said
brooks
clematis
nodded
and
looked
up
shyly
i
was
thinking
about
you
last
night
before
i
went
to
sleep
suppose
i
should
keep
you
with
me
for
a
little
while
do
you
think
you
would
like
that
oh
i
would
help
like
anything
she
cried
you
just
try
me
and
see
well
i
will
talk
to
alder
and
perhaps
you
can
stay
for
a
while
at
least
so
brooks
talked
with
alder
then
he
wrote
to
mrs
snow
yes
clematis
might
stay
a
week
how
hard
she
tried
i
wash
and
wipe
all
the
dishes
she
said
the
very
first
day
she
broke
a
cup
then
she
cried
dear
me
do
feel
bad
about
that
you
are
doing
the
best
you
can
i
know
brooks
laughed
and
clematis
smiled
again
men
do
care
so
much
about
dishes
she
said
to
herself
to
be
sure
clematis
had
not
learned
to
do
much
but
she
had
learned
to
do
her
best
brooks
found
that
she
could
help
in
many
ways
and
she
was
so
anxious
to
do
her
best
that
he
gladly
forgave
her
mistakes
he
made
her
a
little
bed
in
the
room
upstairs
at
evening
she
could
hear
the
wind
whispering
in
the
trees
and
the
little
brook
that
ran
down
from
the
spring
in
the
morning
she
could
see
the
lakes
and
mountains
across
the
valley
as
she
sat
by
her
open
window
while
the
birds
hopped
about
on
the
twigs
and
sang
their
sweetest
songs
illustration
a
little
girl
was
coming
up
the
path
deborah
slept
each
night
in
a
little
box
close
by
her
bed
and
followed
her
about
all
day
long
the
week
passed
very
quickly
on
friday
brooks
saw
that
she
was
silent
and
thoughtful
i
do
think
i
can
spare
you
yet
he
said
at
breakfast
i
must
ask
mrs
snow
to
let
you
stay
another
week
at
least
clematis
was
never
so
happy
she
smiled
and
hummed
a
little
song
all
the
morning
now
and
then
she
would
stop
to
pat
deborah
who
slept
by
the
stove
he
is
going
to
let
me
stay
another
week
debby
she
would
whisper
another
week
another
whole
week
this
week
was
passing
also
when
clematis
had
a
great
surprise
it
was
a
letter
from
miss
rose
oh
read
it
to
me
read
it
to
me
she
exclaimed
as
she
climbed
up
into
brooks
lap
so
he
opened
the
envelope
and
read
dear
clematis
brooks
has
asked
us
if
he
might
keep
you
for
a
year
do
you
think
you
would
like
to

i
shall
go
to
see
you
in
tilton
next

so
you
must
be
thinking
it
over
and
decide
if
you
really
want
to
stay
your
true
friend
rose
thornton
after
he
had
finished
clematis
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
she
looked
up
at
him
with
a
happy
smile
please
read
it
again
she
said
so
he
read
it
again
while
she
sat
still
in
his
lap
do
you
think
you
would
really
like
to
stay
he
asked
when
he
had
finished
clematis
patted
his
hand
and
snuggled
her
face
against
his
shoulder
can
debby
stay
too
she
asked
of
course
she
can
we
could
get
along
without
debby
that
night
clematis
looked
out
at
the
golden
light
just
fading
from
the
mountains
a
star
was
twinkling
in
the
sky
the
brook
was
bubbling
down
among
the
trees
and
the
wind
hummed
a
little
tune
in
their
soft
branches
she
was
very
happy
i
am
going
to
be
happy
always
now
she
said
chapter
xx
the
true
fairy
story
the
next
week
they
got
giles
horse
and
drove
down
to
meet
miss
rose
at
the
station
how
glad
clematis
was
to
see
her
she
sat
in
her
lap
all
the
way
back
to
bean
hill
and
told
her
about
the
mountains
the
lakes
the
trees
and
the
birds
so
you
think
you
would
like
to
stay
a
whole
year
do
you
asked
miss
rose
clematis
smiled
and
nodded
deborah
can
stay
too
she
said
when
they
got
to
the
little
cottage
miss
rose
went
in
with
brooks
and
had
a
long
talk
she
told
him
all
she
knew
about
clematis
he
listened
while
she
told
him
how
clematis
ran
away
how
the
policeman
found
her
and
how
she
came
to
the
home
have
you
any
trace
of
her
father
and
mother
no
they
said
the
father
name
was
jones
but
i
am
not
sure
that
was
her
father
true
name
both
her
father
and
mother
died
when
she
was
a
baby
they
say
brooks
looked
puzzled
did
the
mother
leave
nothing
when
she
died
that
people
might
know
her
by
miss
rose
reached
into
her
little
black
bag
and
brought
out
the
picture
brooks
did
not
take
it
at
first
they
said
the
father
name
was
jones
did
they
tell
you
his
first
name
he
asked
no
just
jones
i
could
learn
no
other
name
miss
rose
held
out
the
picture
and
brooks
hand
trembled
as
he
took
it
after
one
look
he
carried
it
to
the
window
there
he
held
it
to
the
light
and
gazed
at
it
a
long
time
do
you
see
some
one
there
you
know
asked
miss
rose
would
you
know
your
own
daughter
if
you
saw
her
miss
rose
smiled
then
she
saw
tears
in
his
eyes
please
forgive
me
for
smiling
she
said
you
reminded
me
so
much
of
clematis
she
asks
questions
just
like
that
well
would
you
expect
her
to
be
like
her
own
grandfather
then
brooks
smiled
too
is
she
really
your
grandchild
exclaimed
miss
rose
yes
she
is
she
must
be
this
is
her
mother
here
he
pointed
to
one
of
the
girls
in
the
picture
this
was
taken
in
front
of
the
seminary
a
year
before
she
ran
away
to
be
married
oh
it
seems
just
like
a
fairy
story
i
can
hardly
believe
it
miss
rose
looked
again
at
the
picture
yes
it
is
like
a
fairy
story
brooks
replied
dear
wayward
girl
she
need
have
run
away
i
would
have
gladly
forgiven
her
then
you
will
take
clematis
to
live
with
you
i
suppose
yes
indeed
i
have
wondered
about
that
name
clematis
her
mother
loved
flowers
she
loved
the
clematis
vine
about
the
door
most
of
all
i
suppose
she
named
clematis
in
memory
of
her
dear
old
home
said
miss
rose
then
brooks
told
miss
rose
about
the
white
house
on
the
hill
i
suppose
we
ought
to
move
back
there
now
he
said
then
clematis
can
go
to
the
union
school
and
grow
up
like
other
children
it
is
wonderful
it
is
a
fairy
story
i
am
sure
she
replied
for
the
fairies
must
have
led
clematis
to
your
door
she
will
be
the
happiest
child
alive
when
we
tell
her
and
clematis
was
the
happiest
girl
alive
when
they
called
her
in
and
told
her
the
whole
story
she
climbed
into
her
grandfather
lap
and
held
his
hand
while
miss
rose
told
it
just
like
a
fairy
tale
are
we
going
to
live
in
the
house
where
all
the
vines
are
she
asked
when
miss
rose
was
done
yes
dear
you
are
and
i
can
stay
there
always
yes
clematis
and
will
you
be
my
grandpa
always
she
looked
up
at
brooks
he
smiled
and
kissed
her
hot
cheek
yes
little
maiden
you
shall
be
my
housekeeper
and
we
shall
be
as
happy
as
robins
in
an
apple
tree
so
miss
rose
went
back
to
boston
and
told
them
all
the
story
the
children
made
her
tell
it
over
and
over
again
they
said
it
was
better
than
any
fairy
tale
they
had
ever
read
and
did
she
really
sleep
out
in
the
woods
alone
asked
sally
and
does
her
grandfather
really
and
truly
have
a
big
white
house
on
a
hill
asked
jane
yes
yes
yes
it
is
all
true
every
word
of
it
answered
miss
rose
even
clematis
could
hardly
believe
it
all
at
first
she
followed
her
grandfather
all
about
wherever
he
went
for
fear
he
might
fly
away
and
never
come
back
in
the
golden
october
they
moved
up
to
the
white
house
on
the
hill
grandfather
clematis
and
deborah
there
clematis
had
the
room
over
the
porch
where
the
vines
climbed
around
her
window
she
could
look
out
each
morning
and
see
the
river
and
the
lakes
with
the
mountains
beyond
she
felt
a
little
strange
among
all
the
new
people
she
saw
each
day
and
she
had
very
much
to
learn
but
clematis
learned
the
best
thing
of
all
to
do
the
best
she
could
and
she
soon
grew
into
a
sweet
useful
girl
her
little
friends
loved
her
and
her
teachers
helped
her
for
she
tried
to
please
them
and
never
complained
because
things
were
not
easy
to
do
when
she
heard
that
sally
and
the
other
girls
could
hardly
believe
her
story
she
went
and
whispered
to
her
grandfather
may
i
she
asked
of
course
you
may
he
said
as
many
as
you
want
then
she
wrote
a
letter
all
her
own
self
she
invited
all
the
girls
her
own
age
at
the
home
to
visit
her
the
next
summer
and
see
for
themselves
so
if
you
ever
go
to
tilton
you
must
look
about
for
a
strong
happy
girl
with
big
brown
eyes
who
studies
her
lessons
and
works
in
the
garden
and
has
the
happiest
time
any
girl
ever
had
with
her
grandfather
in
the
big
white
house
on
the
hill
