at

he
d
got
far
enough
to
wind
up
with
a
personal
interview
it
s
one
thing
doing
up
an
application
and
seeing
it
go
onto
an
endless
tape
and
be
fed
into
the
maw
of
a
machine
and
then
to
receive
in
a
matter
of
moments
a
neatly
printed
rejection
it
s
another
thing
to
receive
an
appointment
to
be
interviewed
by
a
placement
officer
in
the
commissariat
of
interplanetary
affairs
department
of
personnel
ronny
bronston
was
under
no
illusions
nine
out
of
ten
men
of
his
age
annually
made
the
same
application
almost
all
were
annually
rejected
statistically
speaking
practically
nobody
ever
got
an
interplanetary
position
but
he
d
made
step
one
along
the
path
of
a
lifetime
ambition
he
stood
at
easy
attention
immediately
inside
the
door
at
the
desk
at
the
far
side
of
the
room
the
placement
officer
was
going
through
a
sheaf
of
papers
he
looked
up
and
said
ronald
bronston
sit
down
you
d
like
an
interplanetary
assignment
eh
so
would
ronny
took
the
chair
for
a
moment
he
tried
to
appear
alert
earnest
ambitious
but
not
ambitious
fearless
devoted
to
the
cause
and
indispensable
for
a
moment
then
he
gave
it
up
and
looked
like
ronny
bronston
the
other
looked
up
and
took
him
in
the
personnel
official
saw
a
man
of
averages
in
the
late
twenties
average
height
weight
and
breadth
pleasant
of
face
in
an
average
sort
of
way
but
not
handsome
less
than
sharp
in
dress
hair
inclined
to
be
on
the
undisciplined
side
brown
of
hair
dark
of
eye
in
a
crowd
inconspicuous
in
short
ronny
bronston
the
personnel
officer
grunted
he
pushed
a
button
said
something
into
his
order
box
a
card
slid
into
the
slot
and
he
took
it
out
and
stared
gloomily
at
it
what
re
your
politics
he
said
politics
ronny
bronston
said
i
haven
t
any
politics
my
father
and
grandfather
before
me
have
been
citizens
of
united
planets
there
hasn
t
been
any
politics
in
our
family
for
three
family
the
other
grunted
and
marked
the
card
racial
prejudices
i
beg
your
pardon
do
you
have
any
racial
prejudices
any
at
the
personnel
officer
said
most
people
answer
that
way
at
first
these
days
but
some
don
t
at
second
for
instance
suppose
you
had
to
have
a
blood
transfusion
would
you
have
any
objection
to
it
being
blood
donated
by
say
a
negro
a
chinese
or
say
a
jew
ronny
ticked
it
off
on
his
fingers
one
of
my
greatgrandfathers
was
a
french
who
married
a
moroccan
girl
the
moors
are
a
blend
of
berber
arab
jew
and
negro
another
of
my
greatgrandfathers
was
a
hawaiian
they
re
largely
a
blend
of
polynesians
japanese
chinese
and
caucasians
especially
portuguese
another
of
my
greatgrandfathers
was
irish
english
and
scotch
he
married
a
girl
who
was
half
latvian
half
ronny
wound
it
up
believe
me
if
i
had
a
blood
transfusion
from
just
anybody
at
all
the
blood
would
feel
right
at
the
interviewer
snorted
even
as
he
marked
the
card
that
accounts
for
three
greatgrandfathers
he
said
lightly
you
seem
to
have
made
a
study
of
your
family
tree
what
was
the
other
one
rocky
said
expressionlessly
a
the
secretary
shrugged
and
looked
at
the
card
again
religion
reformed
agnostic
ronny
said
this
one
was
possibly
where
he
ran
into
a
brick
wall
many
of
the
planets
had
strong
religious
beliefs
of
one
sort
or
another
some
of
them
had
state
religions
and
you
either
belonged
or
else
is
there
any
such
church
the
personnel
officer
frowned
no
i
m
a
member
i
m
of
the
opinion
that
if
there
are
any
they
re
keeping
the
fact
from
us
and
if
that
s
the
way
they
want
it
it
s
their
business
if
and
when
they
want
to
contact
of
their
puppets
dangling
from
a
i
suppose
they
ll
do
it
meanwhile
i
ll
the
other
said
interestedly
you
think
that
if
there
is
a
higher
power
and
if
it
ever
wants
to
get
in
touch
with
you
it
will
in
its
own
good
time
sort
of
a
t
call
thing
ll
call
the
personnel
officer
said
there
have
been
a
few
revealed
religions
you
so
they
said
so
they
said
none
of
them
have
made
much
sense
to
me
if
a
wanted
to
contact
man
it
seems
unlikely
to
me
that
it
d
be
all
wrapped
up
in
a
lot
of
complicated
gobbledegook
it
would
all
be
very
clear
the
personnel
officer
sighed
he
marked
the
card
stuck
it
back
into
the
slot
in
his
order
box
and
it
disappeared
he
looked
up
at
ronny
bronston
all
right
that
s
ronny
came
to
his
feet
well
what
happened
the
other
grinned
at
him
sourly
darned
if
i
know
he
said
by
the
time
you
get
to
the
outer
office
you
ll
probably
find
he
scratched
the
end
of
his
nose
and
said
i
sometimes
wonder
what
i
m
doing
ronny
thanked
him
told
him
and
left
in
the
outer
office
a
girl
looked
up
from
a
card
she
d
just
pulled
from
her
own
order
box
ronald
bronston
that
s
she
handed
the
card
to
him
you
re
to
go
to
the
office
of
ross
metaxa
in
the
octagon
commissariat
of
interplanetary
affairs
department
of
justice
bureau
of
investigation
section
in
a
lifetime
spent
in
first
preparing
for
united
planets
employment
and
then
in
working
for
the
organization
ronny
bronston
had
never
been
in
the
octagon
building
he
d
seen
photographs
broadcasts
and
he
d
heard
several
thousand
jokes
on
various
levels
from
pun
to
obscenity
about
getting
around
in
the
building
but
he
d
never
been
there
for
that
matter
he
d
never
been
in
greater
washington
before
other
than
a
long
ago
tourist
trip
population
statistics
his
department
had
its
main
offices
in
new
copenhagen
his
card
was
evidently
all
that
he
needed
for
entry
at
the
sixth
gate
he
dismissed
his
car
and
let
it
shoot
back
into
the
traffic
mess
he
went
up
to
one
of
the
and
presented
the
card
the
guide
inspected
it
section
g
of
the
bureau
of
investigation
he
muttered
every
day
something
new
i
never
heard
of
it
s
probably
some
outfit
in
charge
of
cleaning
the
heads
on
space
ronny
said
unhappily
he
d
never
heard
of
it
either
well
it
s
no
problem
the
said
he
summoned
a
fed
the
into
it
from
ronny
s
card
handed
the
card
back
and
flipped
an
easy
salute
you
ll
soon
the
scooter
slid
into
the
octagon
s
hall
traffic
and
proceeded
up
one
corridor
down
another
twice
taking
to
ascending
ramps
ronny
had
read
somewhere
the
total
miles
of
corridors
in
the
octagon
he
hadn
t
believed
the
figures
at
the
time
now
he
believed
them
he
must
have
traversed
several
miles
before
they
got
to
the
department
of
justice
alone
it
was
another
quarter
mile
to
the
bureau
of
investigation
the
scooter
eventually
came
to
a
halt
waited
long
enough
for
ronny
to
dismount
and
then
hurried
back
into
the
traffic
he
entered
the
office
a
neatly
uniformed
reception
girl
with
a
harassed
and
cynical
eye
looked
up
from
her
desk
ronald
bronston
she
said
that
s
where
ve
you
been
she
had
a
snappy
cuteness
the
commissioner
has
been
awaiting
you
go
through
that
door
and
to
your
ronny
went
through
that
door
and
to
the
left
there
was
another
door
inconspicuously
lettered
metaxa
commissioner
section
ronny
knocked
and
the
door
opened
ross
metaxa
was
going
through
a
wad
of
papers
he
looked
up
a
man
in
the
middle
years
sour
of
expression
moist
of
eye
as
though
he
either
drank
too
much
or
slept
too
little
sit
down
he
said
you
re
ronald
bronston
eh
what
do
they
call
you
ronny
it
says
here
you
ve
got
a
sense
of
humor
that
s
one
of
the
first
requirements
in
this
lunatic
ronny
sat
down
and
tried
to
form
some
opinions
of
the
other
by
his
appearance
he
was
reminded
of
nothing
so
much
as
the
stereotype
city
editor
you
saw
in
the
historical
romance
all
that
was
needed
was
for
metaxa
to
start
banging
on
buttons
and
yelling
something
about
tearing
down
the
front
page
whatever
that
meant
metaxa
said
it
also
says
you
have
some
queer
hobbies
judo
small
weapons
target
shooting
mountain
he
looked
up
from
the
reports
why
does
anybody
climb
mountains
ronny
said
nobody
s
ever
figured
that
didn
t
seem
to
be
enough
especially
since
ross
metaxa
was
staring
at
him
so
he
added
possibly
we
devotees
keep
doing
it
in
hopes
that
someday
somebody
ll
find
ross
metaxa
said
sourly
not
much
humor
please
you
don
t
act
as
though
getting
this
position
means
much
to
ronny
said
slowly
i
figured
out
some
time
ago
that
every
young
man
on
earth
yearns
for
a
job
that
will
send
him
shuttling
from
one
planet
to
another
to
achieve
it
they
study
they
sweat
they
make
all
out
efforts
to
meet
and
suck
up
to
anybody
they
think
might
help
finally
when
and
if
they
get
an
interview
for
one
of
the
few
openings
they
spruce
up
in
their
best
clothes
put
on
their
best
party
manners
present
themselves
as
the
sincere
high
ambitious
young
men
that
they
then
flunk
their
chance
i
decided
i
might
as
well
be
what
i
ross
metaxa
looked
at
him
he
said
finally
we
ll
give
you
a
ronny
said
blankly
you
mean
i
ve
got
the
job
that
s
i
ll
be
probably
metaxa
said
he
yawned
do
you
know
what
section
g
handles
well
no
but
as
for
me
just
so
i
get
off
earth
and
see
some
of
the
metaxa
had
been
sitting
with
his
heels
on
his
desk
now
he
put
them
down
and
reached
a
hand
into
a
drawer
to
emerge
with
a
brown
bottle
and
two
glasses
do
you
drink
he
said
of
even
during
working
hours
metaxa
scowled
when
occasion
good
metaxa
said
he
poured
two
drinks
you
ll
get
your
fill
of
seeing
the
galaxy
he
said
not
that
there
s
much
to
see
man
can
settle
only
planets
and
after
you
ve
seen
a
couple
of
hundred
you
ve
seen
them
ronny
sipped
at
his
drink
then
blinked
reproachfully
down
into
the
glass
metaxa
said
good
eh
a
kind
of
tequila
they
make
on
deneb
eight
bunch
of
mexicans
settled
what
said
ronny
hoarsely
do
they
make
it
out
of
lord
only
knows
metaxa
said
to
get
back
to
section
we
re
interplanetary
security
in
short
department
cloak
and
dagger
would
you
be
willing
to
die
for
the
united
planets
bronston
that
curve
had
come
too
fast
ronny
blinked
again
only
in
emergency
he
said
who
d
want
to
kill
me
metaxa
poured
another
drink
many
of
the
people
you
ll
be
working
with
he
said
well
what
will
i
be
doing
you
ll
be
representing
united
planets
metaxa
explained
representing
united
planets
in
cases
where
the
local
situation
is
such
that
the
folks
you
re
working
among
will
be
teed
off
at
the
well
why
are
they
members
if
they
don
t
like
the
up
that
s
a
good
question
metaxa
said
he
yawned
i
guess
i
ll
have
to
go
into
my
he
finished
his
drink
now
shut
up
till
i
give
you
some
background
you
re
probably
full
of
a
lot
of
nonsense
you
picked
up
in
ronny
shut
up
he
d
expected
more
of
an
air
of
dedication
in
the
octagon
and
in
such
ethereal
departments
as
that
of
interplanetary
justice
however
he
was
in
now
and
not
adverse
to
picking
up
some
sophistication
beyond
the
ken
of
the
employees
of
up
the
other
s
voice
took
on
a
far
away
albeit
bored
tone
it
seems
that
most
of
the
times
man
gets
a
really
big
idea
he
goes
off
half
cocked
just
one
example
remember
when
the
ancient
hellenes
exploded
into
the
mediterranean
a
score
of
different
began
sending
out
colonies
which
in
turn
sprouted
colonies
of
their
own
take
syracuse
on
sicily
hardly
was
she
established
than
bingo
she
sent
off
colonists
to
southern
italy
and
they
in
turn
to
southern
france
corsica
the
balearics
greeks
were
exploding
all
over
the
place
largely
without
adequate
plans
without
rhyme
or
reason
take
alexander
roamed
off
all
the
way
to
india
founding
cities
and
colonies
of
greeks
all
along
the
the
older
man
shifted
in
his
chair
you
wonder
what
i
m
getting
at
eh
well
much
the
same
thing
is
happening
in
man
s
explosion
into
space
now
that
he
has
the
ability
to
leave
the
solar
system
behind
dashing
off
half
cocked
in
all
directions
he
s
flowing
out
over
this
section
of
the
galaxy
without
plan
without
rhyme
or
reason
i
take
that
last
back
he
has
reasons
all
of
the
screwiest
religious
reasons
racial
reasons
idealistic
reasons
political
reasons
altruistic
reasons
and
mercenary
reasons
inadequate
ships
manned
by
small
numbers
of
inadequate
people
setting
out
to
find
their
own
planets
to
establish
themselves
on
one
of
the
numberless
uninhabited
worlds
that
offer
themselves
to
colonization
and
ronny
cleared
his
throat
well
isn
t
that
a
good
thing
sir
ross
metaxa
looked
at
him
and
grunted
what
difference
does
it
make
if
it
s
good
or
not
it
s
happening
we
re
spreading
our
race
out
over
tens
of
hundreds
of
new
worlds
in
the
most
haphazard
fashion
as
a
result
we
of
united
planets
now
have
a
chaotic
mishmash
on
our
hands
how
we
manage
to
keep
as
many
planets
in
the
organization
as
we
do
sometimes
baffles
me
i
suppose
most
of
them
are
afraid
to
drop
out
conscious
of
the
protection
up
gives
against
each
he
picked
up
a
report
here
s
monet
originally
colonized
by
a
bunch
of
painters
writers
musicians
and
such
they
had
dreams
of
starting
a
new
race
with
everybody
artists
they
were
all
so
impractical
that
they
even
managed
to
crash
their
ship
on
landing
for
three
hundred
years
they
were
uncontacted
what
did
they
have
in
the
way
of
government
by
that
time
a
military
theocracy
something
like
the
aztecs
of
mexico
a
matriarchy
at
that
and
what
s
their
religion
based
on
that
of
ancient
phoenicia
including
plenty
of
human
sacrifice
to
good
old
moloch
what
can
united
planets
do
about
it
now
that
they
ve
become
a
member
work
away
very
delicately
trying
to
get
them
to
at
least
eliminate
the
child
sacrifice
phase
of
their
culture
will
they
do
it
hell
no
not
if
they
can
help
it
the
head
priestess
and
her
clique
are
afraid
that
if
they
don
t
have
the
threat
of
sacrifice
to
hold
over
the
people
they
ll
be
ronny
was
surprised
i
d
never
heard
of
a
member
planet
like
that
monet
metaxa
sighed
no
of
course
not
you
ve
got
a
lot
to
learn
ronny
my
lad
first
of
all
what
re
articles
one
and
two
of
the
united
planets
charter
that
was
easy
ronny
recited
article
one
united
planets
organization
shall
take
no
steps
to
interfere
with
the
internal
political
or
religious
institutions
of
its
member
article
two
member
planets
of
united
planets
shall
interfere
with
the
internal
political
socioeconomic
or
religious
institutions
of
any
other
member
he
looked
at
the
department
head
but
what
s
that
got
to
do
with
the
fact
that
i
was
unfamiliar
with
even
the
existence
of
monet
suppose
one
of
the
advanced
planets
or
even
earth
itself
metaxa
growled
openly
discussed
in
magazines
on
newscasts
or
wherever
the
religious
system
of
monet
a
howl
would
go
up
among
the
liberals
the
progressives
the
and
the
howl
would
be
heard
on
the
other
advanced
planets
eventually
the
citizen
in
the
street
on
monet
would
hear
about
it
and
be
affected
and
before
you
knew
it
a
howl
would
go
up
from
monet
s
government
why
because
the
other
planets
would
be
interfering
with
her
internal
affairs
simply
by
discussing
so
what
you
mean
is
ronny
said
part
of
our
job
is
to
keep
information
about
monet
s
government
and
religion
from
being
discussed
at
all
on
other
member
that
s
right
metaxa
nodded
and
that
s
just
one
of
our
dirty
little
jobs
one
of
many
section
g
believe
me
gets
them
all
which
brings
us
to
your
first
ronny
inched
forward
in
his
chair
it
takes
me
into
space
it
takes
you
into
space
all
right
metaxa
snorted
at
least
it
will
after
a
few
months
of
indoctrination
i
m
sending
you
out
after
a
legend
ronny
you
re
fresh
possibly
you
ll
get
some
ideas
older
men
in
the
game
haven
t
thought
a
legend
i
m
sending
you
to
look
for
tommy
paine
some
members
of
the
department
don
t
think
he
exists
i
tommy
paine
a
pseudonym
that
somebody
hung
on
him
way
back
before
even
my
memory
in
this
section
did
you
ever
hear
of
thomas
paine
in
american
history
he
wrote
a
pamphlet
during
the
revolutionary
war
didn
t
he
common
sense
metaxa
nodded
but
he
was
more
than
that
he
was
born
in
england
but
went
to
america
as
a
young
man
and
his
writings
probably
did
as
much
as
anything
to
put
over
the
revolt
against
the
british
but
that
wasn
t
enough
when
that
revolution
was
successful
he
went
back
to
england
and
tried
to
start
one
there
the
government
almost
caught
him
but
he
escaped
and
got
to
france
where
he
participated
in
the
french
he
seemed
to
get
around
ronny
bronston
said
and
so
does
this
namesake
of
his
we
ve
been
trying
to
catch
up
with
him
for
some
twenty
years
how
long
before
that
he
was
active
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
it
was
some
time
before
we
became
aware
of
the
fact
that
half
the
revolts
rebellions
revolutions
and
such
that
occur
in
the
united
planets
have
his
dirty
finger
stirring
around
in
but
you
said
some
department
members
don
t
believe
in
his
metaxa
grunted
they
re
working
on
the
theory
that
no
one
man
could
do
all
that
tommy
paine
has
laid
to
him
possibly
it
s
true
that
he
sometimes
gets
the
blame
for
accomplishments
not
his
or
for
that
matter
possibly
he
s
more
than
one
person
i
don
t
well
ronny
said
hesitantly
what
s
an
example
of
his
activity
metaxa
picked
up
another
report
from
the
confusion
of
his
desk
here
s
one
only
a
month
old
dictator
on
the
planet
megas
kidnapped
and
forced
to
resign
there
s
still
confusion
but
it
looks
as
though
a
new
type
of
government
will
be
formed
but
how
do
they
know
it
wasn
t
just
some
dissatisfied
citizens
of
megas
it
seems
as
though
the
kidnap
vehicle
was
an
old
fashioned
helicopter
there
were
no
such
on
megas
so
section
g
suspects
it
s
a
possible
tommy
paine
case
we
could
be
wrong
of
course
that
s
why
i
say
the
man
s
in
the
way
of
being
a
legend
perhaps
the
others
are
right
and
he
doesn
t
even
exist
i
think
he
does
and
if
so
it
s
our
job
to
get
him
and
put
him
out
of
ronny
said
slowly
but
why
would
that
come
under
our
jurisdiction
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
up
to
the
police
of
whatever
planet
he
was
ross
metaxa
looked
thoughtfully
at
his
brown
bottle
shook
his
head
and
returned
it
to
its
drawer
he
looked
at
a
desk
watch
don
t
read
into
the
united
planets
organization
more
than
there
is
it
s
a
fragile
institution
with
practically
no
independent
powers
to
wield
every
member
planet
is
jealous
of
its
prerogatives
which
is
understandable
it
s
no
mistake
that
articles
one
and
two
are
the
basic
foundation
of
the
charter
no
member
planet
wants
to
be
interfered
with
by
any
other
or
by
united
planets
as
an
organization
they
want
to
be
left
alone
within
our
ranks
we
have
planets
with
every
religion
known
to
man
throughout
the
ages
everything
ranging
from
primitive
animism
to
the
most
advanced
philosophic
ethic
we
have
every
political
system
ever
dreamed
of
and
every
system
it
can
all
be
blamed
on
the
manner
in
which
we
re
colonizing
any
minority
no
matter
how
political
racial
or
it
can
collect
the
funds
to
buy
or
rent
a
spacecraft
can
dash
off
on
its
own
find
a
new
planet
and
set
up
in
business
fine
one
of
the
prime
jobs
of
section
g
is
to
carry
out
to
enforce
articles
one
and
two
of
the
charter
a
planet
with
buddhism
as
its
state
religion
doesn
t
want
some
baptist
missionary
stirring
up
controversy
a
planet
with
a
feudalistic
systems
doesn
t
want
some
interplanetary
businessman
coming
in
with
some
big
deal
that
would
eventually
cause
the
feudalistic
nobility
to
be
tossed
onto
the
ash
heap
a
planet
with
a
dictatorship
doesn
t
want
subversives
from
some
democracy
trying
to
undermine
their
vice
and
its
our
job
to
enforce
all
this
eh
ronny
said
that
s
right
metaxa
told
him
sourly
it
s
not
always
the
nicest
job
in
the
system
however
if
you
believe
in
united
planets
an
organization
attempting
to
in
such
manner
as
it
can
the
efforts
of
its
member
planets
for
the
betterment
of
all
then
you
must
accept
section
g
and
interplanetary
ronny
bronston
thought
about
it
metaxa
added
that
s
why
one
of
the
requirements
of
this
job
is
that
you
yourself
be
a
citizen
of
united
planets
rather
than
of
any
individual
planet
have
no
religious
affiliations
no
political
beliefs
and
no
racial
prejudices
you
ve
got
to
be
able
to
stand
yeah
ronny
said
thoughtfully
ross
metaxa
looked
at
his
watch
again
and
sighed
wearily
i
ll
turn
you
over
to
one
of
my
assistants
he
said
i
ll
see
you
again
though
before
you
before
i
leave
ronny
said
coming
to
his
feet
but
where
do
i
start
looking
for
this
tommy
paine
how
the
hell
would
i
know
ross
metaxa
growled
in
the
outer
office
ronny
said
to
the
receptionist
commissioner
metaxa
said
for
me
to
get
in
touch
with
sid
she
said
i
m
irene
kasansky
are
you
with
us
ronny
said
i
beg
your
pardon
she
said
impatiently
are
you
going
to
be
with
the
section
if
you
are
i
ve
got
to
clear
you
with
your
old
job
you
were
in
statistics
over
in
new
copenhagen
weren
t
you
somehow
it
seemed
far
away
now
the
job
he
d
held
for
more
than
five
years
oh
yes
he
said
yes
commissioner
metaxa
has
given
me
an
she
looked
up
at
him
probably
to
look
for
tommy
he
was
taken
aback
that
s
right
how
did
you
know
there
was
talk
this
section
is
pretty
well
she
grimaced
but
on
her
it
looked
good
one
big
happy
family
high
interdepartmental
morale
that
sort
of
she
flicked
some
switches
you
ll
find
supervisor
jakes
through
that
door
one
to
your
left
two
to
your
he
could
have
asked
one
to
his
left
and
two
to
his
right
but
evidently
irene
kasansky
thought
he
had
enough
information
to
get
him
to
his
destination
she
d
gone
back
to
her
work
illustration
it
was
one
turn
to
his
left
and
two
turns
to
his
right
the
door
was
lettered
simply
he
knocked
and
a
voice
shouted
happily
it
s
open
it
s
always
supervisor
jakes
was
as
informal
as
his
superior
his
attire
was
on
the
side
more
suited
for
sports
wear
than
a
fairly
high
ranking
job
in
the
octagon
he
couldn
t
have
been
much
older
than
ronny
bronston
but
he
had
a
nervous
vitality
about
him
that
would
have
worn
out
the
other
in
a
few
hours
he
jumped
up
and
shook
hands
you
must
be
bronston
call
me
he
waved
a
hand
at
a
typed
report
he
d
been
reading
now
i
ve
seen
them
all
they
ve
just
applied
for
entry
to
united
planets
republic
what
a
name
eh
what
ronny
said
sit
down
sit
he
rushed
ronny
to
a
chair
saw
him
seated
returned
to
the
desk
and
flicked
an
order
box
switch
irene
he
said
do
up
a
badge
for
ronny
will
you
you
ve
got
his
code
haven
t
you
good
send
it
over
bronze
of
sid
jakes
turned
back
to
ronny
and
grinned
at
him
he
motioned
to
the
report
again
what
a
name
for
a
planet
republic
bunch
of
again
out
in
the
vicinity
of
sirius
based
their
system
on
plato
s
have
to
go
the
whole
way
don
t
even
speak
basic
certainly
not
they
speak
ancient
greek
that
s
going
to
be
a
neat
trick
finding
interpreters
how
d
you
like
the
old
man
ronny
said
dazed
at
the
conversational
barrage
old
man
oh
you
mean
commissioner
sure
sure
sid
grinned
perching
himself
on
the
edge
of
the
desk
did
he
give
you
that
drink
of
tequila
during
working
hours
routine
he
d
like
to
poison
every
new
agent
we
get
what
a
the
grin
was
infectious
ronny
said
carefully
well
i
did
think
his
method
of
hiring
a
new
man
was
a
cavalier
yet
sid
jakes
chortled
look
don
t
get
the
old
man
wrong
he
knows
what
he
s
doing
he
always
knows
what
he
s
but
he
took
me
on
after
only
two
or
three
minutes
jakes
cocked
his
head
to
one
side
oh
you
think
so
when
did
you
first
apply
for
interplanetary
assignment
ronny
i
don
t
know
about
three
years
jakes
nodded
well
depend
on
it
you
ve
been
under
observation
for
that
length
of
time
at
any
one
period
section
g
is
investigating
possibly
a
thousand
potential
agents
we
need
men
but
qualifications
are
he
hopped
down
from
his
position
sped
around
to
the
other
side
of
the
desk
and
lowered
himself
into
his
chair
don
t
get
the
wrong
idea
though
you
re
not
in
you
re
on
probation
whatever
the
assignment
the
old
man
gave
you
you
ve
got
to
carry
it
out
successfully
before
you
re
full
he
flicked
the
switch
and
said
irene
where
the
devil
s
ronny
s
badge
ronny
bronston
heard
the
office
girl
s
voice
answer
snappishly
all
right
all
right
jakes
said
i
love
you
too
send
it
in
when
it
he
turned
to
ronny
what
your
assignment
he
wants
me
to
go
looking
for
some
firebrand
nicknamed
tommy
paine
i
m
supposed
to
arrest
him
the
commissioner
said
you
d
give
me
sid
jakes
face
went
serious
he
puckered
up
his
lips
wow
that
ll
be
a
neat
trick
to
pull
off
he
said
he
flicked
the
switch
again
irene
s
voice
snapped
something
before
he
could
say
anything
and
sid
jakes
grinned
and
said
darling
but
if
this
is
the
way
you
re
going
to
be
i
won
t
marry
you
then
what
will
the
children
say
besides
that
s
not
what
i
called
about
have
ballistics
do
up
a
model
h
gun
for
ronny
will
you
be
sure
it
s
adjusted
to
his
he
flicked
off
the
order
box
and
turned
back
to
ronny
i
understand
you
re
familiar
with
hand
guns
it
s
in
this
report
on
ronny
nodded
he
was
just
beginning
to
adjust
to
this
character
what
will
i
need
a
gun
for
jakes
laughed
heavens
to
betsy
you
babe
in
the
woods
do
you
realize
this
tommy
paine
character
has
supposedly
stirred
up
a
couple
of
score
wars
revolutions
and
revolts
not
to
speak
of
having
laid
in
his
lap
two
or
three
dozen
assassinations
he
s
a
quick
lad
with
a
gun
a
regular
nihilist
jakes
chuckled
when
you
ve
been
in
this
section
for
a
while
you
ll
be
familiar
with
every
screwball
outfit
man
has
ever
dreamed
up
the
nihilists
were
a
european
group
mostly
russian
back
in
the
nineteenth
century
they
believed
that
by
bumping
off
a
few
grand
dukes
and
a
czar
or
so
they
could
force
the
ruling
class
to
grant
reforms
sometimes
they
were
pretty
ingenious
blew
up
trains
that
sort
of
look
here
ronny
said
what
motivates
this
paine
fellow
what
s
he
get
out
of
all
this
trouble
he
stirs
up
search
me
nobody
seems
to
know
some
think
he
s
a
mental
case
for
one
thing
he
s
not
how
do
you
mean
well
he
ll
go
to
one
planet
and
break
his
back
trying
to
overthrow
say
feudalism
then
possibly
after
being
successful
he
goes
to
another
planet
and
devotes
his
energies
to
establishing
the
same
ronny
assimilated
that
you
re
one
of
those
who
believes
he
exists
oh
he
exists
all
right
all
right
sid
jakes
said
happily
matter
of
fact
i
almost
ran
into
him
a
few
years
ronny
leaned
forward
i
guess
i
ought
to
know
about
it
the
more
information
i
have
the
sure
sure
jakes
said
this
deal
of
mine
was
on
one
of
the
aldebaran
planets
a
bunch
of
nature
boys
had
settled
nature
boys
back
to
nature
the
trouble
with
the
human
race
is
that
it
s
got
too
far
away
from
nature
so
a
whole
flock
of
them
landed
on
this
planet
they
call
it
mother
of
all
things
they
landed
and
set
up
a
primitive
society
absolute
stone
age
no
metals
lived
by
the
chase
and
by
picking
berries
wild
fruit
that
sort
of
thing
not
even
any
agriculture
wore
skins
bows
and
arrows
were
the
nearest
thing
they
allowed
themselves
in
the
way
of
mechanical
good
grief
ronny
said
it
was
a
laugh
jakes
told
him
i
was
assigned
there
as
section
g
representative
with
the
up
organization
picture
it
we
had
to
wear
skins
for
clothes
we
had
to
confine
ourselves
to
two
or
three
long
houses
something
like
the
american
iroquois
lived
in
before
columbus
their
society
on
mother
was
based
on
primitive
communism
the
clan
the
phratry
the
tribe
their
religion
was
mostly
a
matter
of
knocking
into
everybody
s
head
that
any
progress
was
taboo
oh
it
was
well
were
they
happy
what
s
happiness
i
suppose
they
were
as
happy
as
anybody
ever
averages
frankly
i
didn
t
mind
the
assignment
lots
of
fishing
lots
of
ronny
said
well
where
does
tommy
paine
come
in
he
snuck
up
on
us
started
way
back
in
the
boondocks
away
from
any
of
the
larger
primitive
settlements
went
around
putting
himself
over
as
a
holy
man
cured
people
of
various
things
from
gangrene
to
eye
diseases
given
antibiotics
and
such
you
can
imagine
how
successful
he
well
what
harm
did
he
do
i
didn
t
say
he
did
any
harm
but
in
that
manner
he
made
himself
awfully
popular
then
he
d
pull
some
trick
like
showing
them
how
to
smelt
iron
and
distribute
some
corn
and
wheat
seed
around
and
plant
the
idea
of
agriculture
the
local
witch
doctors
would
try
to
give
him
a
hard
time
but
the
people
figured
he
was
a
holy
well
what
happened
finally
ronny
wasn
t
following
too
well
communications
being
what
they
were
before
he
d
been
discovered
by
the
central
had
a
kind
of
council
of
tribes
which
met
once
a
d
planted
so
many
ideas
that
they
couldn
t
be
stopped
the
young
people
d
never
go
back
to
flint
knives
once
introduced
to
iron
we
went
looking
for
friend
tommy
paine
but
he
got
wind
of
it
and
took
off
we
even
found
where
he
d
hidden
his
little
space
cruiser
oh
it
was
paine
all
right
all
but
what
harm
did
he
do
i
don
t
understand
ronny
scowled
he
threw
the
whole
shebang
on
its
ear
last
i
heard
the
planet
had
broken
up
into
three
main
camps
they
were
whaling
away
at
each
other
like
the
assyrians
and
egyptians
iron
weapons
chariots
domesticated
horses
agriculture
was
sweeping
the
planet
population
was
exploding
men
were
making
slaves
out
of
each
other
to
put
them
to
work
oh
it
was
a
mess
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
original
nature
a
red
light
flickered
on
his
desk
and
sid
jakes
opened
a
delivery
drawer
and
dipped
his
hand
into
it
it
emerged
with
a
flat
wallet
he
tossed
it
to
ronny
bronston
here
you
are
your
ronny
opened
the
wallet
and
examined
it
he
d
never
seen
one
before
but
for
that
matter
he
d
never
heard
of
section
g
before
that
morning
it
was
a
simple
enough
bronze
badge
it
said
on
it
merely
bronston
section
g
bureau
of
investigation
united
sid
jakes
explained
you
ll
get
with
that
through
the
justice
department
anywhere
you
go
we
ll
brief
you
further
on
procedure
during
indoctrination
you
in
turn
of
course
are
to
with
any
other
agent
of
section
you
re
under
orders
of
anyone
with
hand
snaked
into
a
pocket
and
emerged
with
a
wallet
similar
to
ronny
a
silver
badge
carried
by
a
first
grade
agent
or
a
gold
one
of
supervisor
ronny
noted
that
his
badge
wasn
t
really
bronze
it
had
a
certain
sheen
a
brightness
jakes
said
here
look
at
he
tossed
his
own
badge
to
the
new
man
ronny
looked
down
at
it
in
surprise
the
gold
had
gone
dull
jakes
laughed
now
give
me
ronny
got
up
and
walked
over
to
him
and
handed
it
over
as
soon
as
the
other
man
s
hand
touched
it
the
bronze
lost
its
sheen
jakes
handed
it
back
see
it
s
tuned
to
you
alone
he
said
and
mine
is
tuned
to
my
code
nobody
can
swipe
a
section
g
badge
and
impersonate
an
agent
if
anybody
ever
shows
you
a
badge
that
doesn
t
have
its
sheen
you
know
he
s
a
fake
neat
trick
eh
very
neat
ronny
admitted
he
returned
the
other
s
gold
badge
look
to
get
back
to
this
tommy
but
the
red
light
flickered
again
and
jakes
brought
forth
from
the
delivery
drawer
a
hand
gun
complete
with
shoulder
harness
nasty
weapon
he
said
but
we
d
better
go
on
down
to
the
armory
and
show
you
its
he
stood
up
oh
yes
don
t
let
me
forget
to
give
you
a
communicator
a
real
gizmo
about
as
big
as
a
woman
s
vanity
case
puts
you
in
immediate
contact
with
the
nearest
section
g
office
no
matter
how
near
or
far
away
it
is
or
if
you
wish
in
contact
with
our
offices
here
in
the
octagon
very
neat
he
led
ronny
from
his
office
and
down
the
corridors
beyond
to
an
elevator
he
said
happily
this
is
a
crazy
outfit
this
section
you
ll
probably
love
it
everybody
ronny
learned
to
love
section
moderation
he
was
initially
taken
aback
by
the
existence
of
the
organization
at
all
he
d
known
of
course
of
the
department
of
justice
and
even
of
the
bureau
of
investigation
but
section
g
was
and
not
even
united
planets
publications
ever
mentioned
it
the
problems
involved
in
remaining
weren
t
as
great
as
all
that
the
very
magnitude
of
the
up
which
involved
more
than
two
thousand
member
planets
allowed
of
departments
and
bureaus
hidden
away
in
the
endless
stretches
of
red
tape
in
fact
although
ronny
bronston
had
spent
the
better
part
of
his
life
thus
far
in
studying
for
a
place
in
the
organization
and
then
working
in
the
population
statistics
department
for
some
years
he
was
only
now
beginning
to
get
the
picture
of
the
workings
of
the
mushrooming
chaotic
united
planets
organization
it
was
earth
s
largest
industry
by
far
in
fact
for
all
practical
purposes
it
was
her
only
major
industry
tourism
yes
but
even
that
in
a
way
was
related
to
the
united
planets
organization
millions
of
visitors
whose
ancestors
had
once
emigrated
from
the
mother
planet
streamed
back
in
racial
nostalgia
streamed
back
to
see
the
continents
and
oceans
the
arctic
and
the
antarctic
the
amazon
river
and
mount
everest
the
sahara
and
new
york
city
the
ruins
of
rome
and
athens
the
vatican
the
louvre
and
the
hermitage
but
the
populace
of
earth
in
its
hundreds
of
millions
were
largely
citizens
of
united
planets
and
worked
in
the
organization
and
with
its
auxiliaries
such
as
the
space
forces
section
g
to
his
surprise
ronny
found
that
ross
metaxa
s
small
section
of
the
bureau
of
investigation
seemed
almost
as
great
a
secret
within
the
bureau
as
it
was
to
the
man
in
the
street
at
one
period
ronny
wondered
if
it
were
possible
that
this
was
a
department
which
had
been
lost
in
the
wilderness
of
boondoggling
that
goes
on
in
any
great
bureaucracy
had
section
g
been
set
up
a
century
or
so
ago
and
then
forgotten
by
those
who
had
originally
thought
there
was
a
need
for
it
in
the
same
way
that
it
is
usually
more
difficult
to
get
a
statute
off
the
lawbooks
than
it
was
originally
to
pass
it
in
the
same
manner
eliminating
an
office
with
its
employees
can
prove
more
difficult
than
originally
establishing
it
but
that
wasn
t
it
in
spite
of
the
informality
the
unconventional
brashness
of
its
personnel
on
all
levels
and
the
seeming
chaos
in
which
its
tasks
were
done
section
g
was
no
project
set
up
to
provide
juicy
jobs
for
the
relatives
of
high
ranking
officials
to
the
contrary
it
didn
t
take
long
in
the
section
before
anybody
with
open
eyes
could
see
that
ross
metaxa
was
privy
to
the
decisions
made
by
the
upper
echelons
of
up
ronny
bronston
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
appointment
he
d
received
was
putting
him
in
a
higher
bracket
of
the
up
hierarchy
than
he
d
at
first
imagined
his
indoctrination
course
was
a
strain
such
as
he
d
never
known
in
school
years
ross
metaxa
was
evidently
of
the
opinion
that
a
man
could
assimilate
concentrated
information
at
a
rate
several
times
faster
than
any
professional
educator
ever
dreamed
possible
no
threats
were
made
but
ronny
realized
that
he
could
be
dropped
even
more
quickly
than
he
d
seemed
to
have
been
taken
on
there
were
no
classes
to
either
push
or
retard
the
rate
of
study
he
worked
with
a
series
of
tutors
and
pushed
himself
the
tutors
were
almost
invariably
section
g
agents
temporarily
in
greater
washington
between
assignments
or
for
briefing
on
this
phase
or
that
of
their
work
even
as
he
studied
ronny
bronston
kept
the
eventual
assignment
at
which
he
was
to
prove
himself
in
mind
he
made
a
point
of
inquiring
of
each
agent
he
met
about
tommy
paine
the
name
was
known
to
all
but
no
two
reacted
in
the
same
manner
several
of
them
even
brushed
the
whole
matter
aside
as
pure
legend
could
accomplish
all
the
trouble
that
tommy
paine
had
supposedly
stirred
up
to
one
of
these
ronny
said
plaintively
see
here
the
old
man
believes
in
him
sid
jakes
believes
in
him
my
final
appointment
depends
on
arresting
him
how
can
i
ever
secure
this
job
if
i
m
chasing
a
myth
the
other
shrugged
don
t
ask
me
i
ve
got
my
own
problems
now
let
s
run
over
this
question
of
napoleonic
law
there
are
at
least
two
hundred
planets
that
base
their
legal
system
on
but
the
majority
of
his
fellow
employees
in
section
g
had
strong
enough
opinions
on
the
interplanetary
firebrand
three
or
four
even
claimed
to
have
seen
him
fleetingly
although
no
two
descriptions
jibed
that
of
course
could
be
explained
the
man
could
resort
to
plastic
surgery
and
other
disguise
theories
there
were
in
plenty
some
of
them
going
back
long
years
and
some
of
them
pure
fable
look
ronny
said
in
disgust
one
day
after
a
particularly
unbelievable
siege
with
two
agents
recently
returned
from
a
trouble
spot
in
a
planetary
system
that
involved
three
aggressive
worlds
which
revolved
about
the
same
sun
look
it
s
impossible
for
one
man
to
accomplish
all
this
he
s
blamed
for
half
the
d
revolts
and
upheavals
that
have
taken
place
for
the
past
quarter
century
it
s
obvious
nonsense
why
a
revolutionist
usually
spends
the
greater
part
of
his
life
toppling
a
government
then
once
it
s
toppled
he
spends
the
rest
of
his
life
trying
to
set
up
a
new
he
s
usually
one
of
the
others
was
shaking
his
head
negatively
you
don
t
understand
this
tommy
paine
s
system
you
sure
don
t
the
other
agent
a
nigerian
grinned
widely
i
ve
been
on
planets
where
he
d
ronny
leaned
forward
the
three
of
them
were
having
a
beer
in
a
part
of
the
city
once
called
baltimore
you
have
he
said
tell
me
about
it
eh
the
more
background
i
get
on
this
guy
the
sure
and
this
ll
give
you
an
idea
of
how
he
operates
how
he
can
get
so
much
trouble
done
well
i
was
on
this
planet
goshen
understand
it
had
kind
of
a
strange
history
a
bunch
of
colonists
went
out
there
oh
four
or
five
centuries
ago
pretty
healthy
expedition
as
such
outfits
go
bright
young
people
lots
of
equipment
lots
of
and
books
well
through
sheer
bad
luck
everything
went
wrong
from
the
beginning
everything
before
they
got
set
up
at
all
they
had
an
explosion
that
killed
off
all
their
communications
technicians
they
lost
contact
with
the
outside
within
a
couple
of
centuries
they
d
gotten
into
a
state
of
chattel
slavery
pretty
well
organized
but
static
kind
of
an
athenian
democracy
on
top
a
hierarchy
but
nineteen
people
out
of
twenty
were
slaves
and
i
mean
real
slaves
like
animals
they
were
at
this
stage
when
a
scout
ship
from
the
up
space
forces
discovered
them
and
of
course
they
joined
where
does
tommy
paine
come
in
ronny
said
he
signaled
to
a
waiter
for
more
beer
he
comes
in
a
few
years
later
i
was
the
section
g
agent
on
goshen
understand
no
planet
was
keener
about
articles
one
and
two
of
the
up
charter
the
hierarchy
understood
well
enough
that
if
their
people
ever
came
to
know
about
more
advanced
systems
it
d
be
the
end
of
goshen
s
golden
age
so
they
allowed
practically
no
intercourse
no
contact
whatsoever
between
up
personnel
and
anyone
outside
the
upper
class
understand
all
right
that
s
where
tommy
paine
came
in
it
couldn
t
have
taken
him
more
than
a
couple
of
months
at
ronny
bronston
was
fascinated
what
d
he
do
he
introduced
the
steam
engine
and
then
ronny
was
looking
at
him
blankly
steam
engine
that
and
the
fly
shuttle
and
the
spinning
jenny
the
nigerian
said
that
goshen
hierarchy
never
knew
what
hit
ronny
was
still
blank
the
waiter
came
up
with
the
steins
of
beer
and
ronny
took
one
and
drained
half
of
it
without
taking
his
eyes
from
the
storyteller
the
other
agent
took
it
up
don
t
you
see
their
system
was
based
on
chattel
slavery
hand
labor
given
machinery
and
it
collapses
chattel
slavery
isn
t
practical
in
a
mechanized
society
too
expensive
a
labor
force
for
one
thing
besides
you
need
an
educated
man
and
one
with
some
that
few
slaves
run
an
industrial
ronny
finished
his
beer
smart
cooky
isn
t
he
he
s
smart
all
right
but
i
ve
got
a
still
better
example
of
his
fouling
up
a
whole
planetary
system
in
a
matter
of
weeks
a
friend
of
mine
was
working
on
a
planet
with
a
feudalism
barons
lords
dukes
counts
and
all
stashed
safely
away
in
castles
and
fortresses
up
on
the
top
of
hills
the
serfs
down
below
did
all
the
work
in
the
fields
provided
servants
artisans
and
foot
soldiers
for
the
continual
fighting
that
the
aristocracy
carried
on
very
similar
to
europe
back
in
the
dark
so
ronny
said
i
d
think
that
d
be
a
deal
that
would
take
centuries
to
the
section
g
agent
laughed
tommy
paine
stayed
just
long
enough
to
introduce
gunpowder
that
was
the
end
of
those
impregnable
castles
up
on
the
what
gets
me
ronny
said
slowly
is
his
the
other
two
both
grunted
agreement
to
that
toward
the
end
of
his
indoctrination
studies
ronny
appeared
one
morning
at
the
octagon
section
g
offices
and
before
irene
kasansky
watching
her
fingers
fly
listening
to
her
voice
rapping
and
snapping
and
rejecting
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
automation
could
go
just
so
far
in
office
work
and
then
you
were
thrown
back
on
the
hands
of
the
efficient
secretary
irene
was
a
office
staff
she
looked
up
at
him
hello
ronny
thought
you
d
be
off
on
your
assignment
by
now
got
any
clues
on
tommy
paine
no
he
said
that
s
why
i
m
here
i
wanted
to
see
the
about
what
she
flicked
a
switch
when
a
light
flickered
on
one
of
her
order
boxes
she
said
into
it
no
emphatically
and
turned
back
to
him
he
said
he
wanted
to
see
me
again
before
i
took
she
fiddled
some
more
finally
said
all
right
ronny
tell
him
he
s
got
time
for
five
minutes
with
five
minutes
then
he
s
got
an
appointment
with
the
commissioner
of
interplanetary
culture
she
said
you
d
better
hurry
ronny
bronston
retraced
the
route
of
his
first
visit
here
how
long
ago
it
already
seemed
ages
since
his
probationary
appointment
your
life
changed
fast
when
you
were
in
section
ross
metaxa
s
brown
bottle
or
its
twin
was
sitting
on
his
desk
and
he
was
staring
at
it
glumly
he
looked
up
and
scowled
ronald
bronston
ronny
said
irene
kasansky
told
me
to
say
i
could
have
five
minutes
with
you
then
you
have
an
appointment
with
the
commissioner
of
interplanetary
i
remember
you
metaxa
said
have
a
drink
interplanetary
culture
ha
the
xanadu
folk
dance
troupe
they
dance
nude
they
ve
been
touring
the
whole
up
roaring
success
everywhere
obviously
now
they
re
assigned
to
virtue
a
planet
settled
by
a
bunch
of
fundamentalists
they
want
the
troupe
to
wear
mother
hubbards
the
xanadu
outfit
is
in
a
tizzy
they
ve
been
insulted
they
claim
they
re
the
most
modest
members
of
up
that
nudity
has
nothing
to
do
with
modesty
the
government
of
virtue
said
that
s
fine
but
they
wear
mother
hubbards
or
they
don
t
dance
xanadu
says
it
ll
withdraw
from
united
ronny
bronston
said
painfully
why
not
let
them
ross
metaxa
poured
himself
a
denebian
tequila
offered
his
subordinate
a
drink
again
with
a
motion
of
the
bottle
ronny
shook
his
head
metaxa
said
if
we
didn
t
take
steps
to
soothe
these
things
over
there
wouldn
t
be
any
united
planets
in
any
given
century
every
member
in
the
organization
threatens
to
resign
at
least
once
even
earth
and
then
what
d
happen
you
d
have
interplanetary
war
before
you
knew
it
what
d
you
want
ronny
i
m
about
set
to
take
up
my
search
for
this
tommy
ah
yes
tommy
paine
if
you
catch
him
there
are
a
dozen
planets
where
he
d
be
eligible
for
the
death
ronny
cleared
his
throat
there
must
be
what
i
wanted
was
the
file
on
him
file
yes
sir
i
ve
got
to
the
point
where
i
want
to
cram
up
on
everything
we
have
on
him
so
far
all
i
ve
got
is
verbal
information
from
individual
agents
and
from
supervisor
don
t
be
silly
ronny
there
isn
t
any
file
on
tommy
ronny
just
looked
at
the
other
ross
metaxa
said
impatiently
the
very
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
the
man
is
top
secret
isn
t
that
obvious
suppose
some
reporter
got
the
story
and
printed
it
if
our
member
planets
knew
there
was
such
a
man
and
that
we
haven
t
been
able
to
scotch
him
why
they
d
drop
out
of
up
so
fast
the

s
not
one

in

that
feels
secure
enough
to
lay
itself
open
to
subversion
why
some
of
our
planets
are
so
far
down
the
ladder
of
social
evolution
they
live
under
primitive
tribal
society
their
leaders
their
wise
men
and
whatever
you
call
them
are
scared
someone
will
come
along
and
establish
chattel
slavery
those
planets
that
have
a
system
based
on
slavery
are
scared
to
death
of
developing
feudalism
and
those
that
have
feudalism
are
afraid
of
those
with

we
have
afraid
of
being
subverted
to

those
who

are
afraid
of

the
systems
based
on
private
ownership
of

hate

he
glared
at
ronny
what
do
you
think
the
purpose
of
this
section
is
bronston
our
job
is
to
keep
our
member
planets

afraid
of
each
other
if
they

his
group
if

got
a

buzzing
through

subverting
everything
they
can
foul
up

emphatically
deny

the

roaring
toward

the

which
was
more
than
ronny
bronston
thought
sid
jakes
already
had
a
visitor
in
his
office
which
didn
t
prevent
him
from
yelling
it
s
open
when
ronny
bronston
knocked
he
bounced
from
his
chair
came
around
the
desk
and
shook
hands
enthusiastically

he
said
his
tone
implying
they
were
favorite
brothers
for
long
years
parted
you
re
just
in
ronny
took
in
the
office
s
other
occupant
appreciatively
she
was
a
small
girl
almost
tiny
he
estimated
her
to
be
at
least
half
chinese
or
maybe
the
rest
probably
european
or
north
american
she
evidently
favored
her
asiatic
blood
her
dress
was
traditional
chinese
slit
almost
to
the
thigh
shanghai
style

ronny
mumbled
something
to
the
girl
in
the
way
of
amenity
then
looked
back
at
the
supervisor
working
together
he
said
that

right

and
hurried
around

turned
his
eyes
to
the

no

on

ronny
said
taking
his
eyes
from
the

and
trying
to
catch
up
with
the
conversation
of
his
superior
new
delos
it
is

said
happily
with

you

before

chuckled
at
the

expression
look
alive
ronny
the
quarry
is
flushed
and
on
the
run
tommy
paine
s
just
assassinated
the
immortal
of
new
delos
a
neat
trick
eh
the
following
hours
were
chaotic
there
was
no
indication
of
how
long
a
period
he
d
be
gone
for
all
he
knew
it
might
be
years
for
that
matter
he
might
never
return
to
earth
this
ronny
bronston
had
realized
before
he
ever
applied
for
an
interplanetary
appointment
mankind
was
exploding
through
this
spiral
arm
of
the
galaxy
there
was
a
racial
enthusiasm
about
it
all
man
s
destiny
lay
out
in
the
stars
only
a
laggard
stayed
home
of
his
own
accord
it
was
the
ambition
of
every
youth
to
join
the
snowballing
avalanche
of
man
into
the
neighboring
stars
it
took
absolute
severity
by
earth
authorities
to
prevent
the
depopulation
of
the
planet
but
someone
had
to
stay
to
administer
the
ever
more
complicated
racial
destiny
earth
became
a
clearing
house
for
a
thousand
cultures
attempting
with
only
moderate
success
to
her
widely
spreading
children
she
couldn
t
afford
to
let
her
best
seed
depart
few
there
were
any
more
allowed
to
emigrate
from
earth
new
colonies
drew
their
immigrants
from
older
ones
lucky
was
the
earthling
able
to
find
service
in
interplanetary
affairs
in
any
of
the
thousands
of
tasks
that
involved
journey
between
member
planets
of
up
possibly
one
hundredth
of
the
population
at
one
time
or
another
and
for
varying
lengths
of
time
managed
it
ronny
bronston
was
lucky
and
knew
it
the
thing
now
was
to
pull
off
this
assignment
and
cinch
the
appointment
for
good
he
packed
in
a
swirl
of
confusion
he
phoned
a
relative
who
lived
in
the
part
of
town
once
known
as
richmond
explained
the
situation
and
asked
that
the
other
store
his
things
and
dispose
of
the
apartment
he
d
been
occupying
luckily
the
roof
of
his
apartment
building
was
a
pickup
point
and
he
was
able
to
hustle
over
to
the
shuttleport
in
a
matter
of
a
few
minutes
he
banged
into
the
reservations
office
hurried
up
to
one
of
the
windows
and
said
into
the
screen
i
ve
got
to
get
to
neuve
albuquerque
the
expressionless
voice
said
the
next
rocket
leaves
at
sixteen
sixteen
hours
i
ve
got
to
be
at
the
spaceport
by
that
time
the
voice
said
dispassionately
we
are
the
bottom
fell
out
of
everything
ronny
said
desperately
look
if
i
miss
my
ship
in
neuve
albuquerque
what
is
the
next
spaceliner
leaving
from
there
for
new
delos
a
moment
there
was
an
agonized
wait
and
then
the
voice
said
there
is
a
liner
leaving
for
new
delos
on
the
of
next
month
it
arrives
in
new
delos
on
the
basic
earth
the
tommy
paine
could
be
halfway
across
the
galaxy
by
that
time
a
gentle
voice
next
to
him
said
could
i
help
ronny
he
looked
around
at
her
evidently
nobody
can
he
said
disgustedly
there
s
no
way
of
getting
to
neuve
albuquerque
in
time
to
get
that
cruiser
to
new
tog
lee
chang
chu
fished
in
her
bag
and
came
up
with
a
wallet
similar
to
the
one
in
which
ronny
carried
his
section
g
badge
she
held
it
up
to
the
screen
bureau
of
investigation
section
g
she
said
calmly
it
will
be
necessary
that
agent
bronston
and
myself
be
in
neuve
albuquerque
within
the
the
metallic
voice
said
of
course
proceed
to
your
right
and
through
corridor
k
to
exit
four
your
rocket
will
be
there
identify
yourself
to
lieutenant
economou
who
will
be
at
the
desk
at
exit
tog
turned
to
ronny
bronston
shall
we
go
she
said
demurely
he
cleared
his
throat
feeling
foolish
thanks
tog
he
said
not
at
all
ronny
why
this
is
my
was
there
the
faintest
of
sarcasm
in
her
voice
it
hadn
t
been
more
than
a
couple
of
hours
ago
that
he
had
been
hinting
rather
heavily
to
sid
jakes
that
he
needed
no
assistance
she
even
knew
the
layout
of
the
west
greater
washington
shuttleport
her
small
body
swiveled
through
the
hurrying
passengers
her
small
feet
as
she
led
him
to
and
down
corridor
k
and
then
to
the
desk
at
exit
four
ronny
anticipated
her
here
he
flashed
his
own
badge
at
the
space
forces
lieutenant
there
lieutenant
economou
he
said
ronald
bronston
of
the
bureau
of
investigation
section
we
ve
got
to
get
to
neuve
albuquerque
the
lieutenant
only
mildly
impressed
said
we
can
have
you
in
the
air
in
ten
minutes
citizen
just
a
moment
and
i
ll
guide
you
in
the
rocket
ronny
had
time
to
appraise
her
at
greater
length
she
was
a
delicately
pretty
thing
although
her
expression
was
inclined
to
the
there
was
only
a
touch
of
the
mongolian
fold
at
the
corner
of
her
eyes
on
her
it
looked
unusually
good
her
complexion
was
that
which
only
the
blend
of
chinese
and
caucasian
can
give
her
figure
thanks
to
her
european
blood
was
fuller
than
eastern
asia
usually
boasts
tiny
but
full
let
s
admit
it
he
decided
my
assistant
is
the
cutest
trick
this
side
of
a
movie
queen
and
we
re
going
to
be
thrown
in
the
closest
of
juxtaposition
for
an
indefinite
time
this
comes
under
the
head
of
work
he
said
look
here
tog
you
were
with
sid
jakes
longer
than
i
was
what
s
the
full
story
she
folded
her
slim
hands
in
her
lap
looking
like
a
schoolgirl
about
to
recite
do
you
know
anything
about
the
system
on
new
delos
well
no
he
admitted
she
said
severely
i
d
think
that
they
would
have
given
you
more
background
before
an
assignment
of
this
ronny
said
impatiently
in
the
past
three
months
i
ve
been
filled
in
on
the
economic
systems
the
religious
beliefs
the
political
forms
of
a
thousand
planets
i
just
happened
to
miss
new
her
mouth
expressed
disapproval
by
rucking
down
on
the
sides
which
was
all
very
attractive
but
also
irritating
she
said
there
are
two
thousand
four
hundred
and
member
planets
in
the
up
i
d
think
an
agent
of
section
g
would
be
up
on
the
basic
situation
on
he
had
her
there
he
said
snidely
hate
to
contradict
you
tog
but
the
number
is
two
thousand
four
hundred
and
then
she
nodded
agreeably
membership
has
changed
since
this
morning
when
menalaus
and
aldebaran
three
were
admitted
have
two
planets
dropped
out
look
he
said
let
s
stop
bickering
what
s
the
word
on
new
delos
did
you
ever
read
frazer
s
golden
bough
she
said
you
should
at
any
rate
new
delos
is
a
theocracy
a
priesthood
elite
rules
it
a
who
is
immortal
holds
absolute
authority
the
strongest
of
superstition
plus
an
efficient
inquisition
keeps
the
people
under
sounds
terrible
ronny
growled
why
possibly
the
government
is
extremely
efficient
and
under
it
the
planet
progressing
at
a
rate
in
advance
of
up
he
stared
at
her
in
surprise
she
said
would
you
rather
be
ruled
by
the
personal
arbitrary
whims
of
supremely
wise
men
or
by
laws
formulated
by
a
mob
it
stopped
him
momentarily
in
all
his
adult
years
he
couldn
t
remember
ever
meeting
an
intelligent
educated
person
who
had
been
opposed
to
the
democratic
theory
wait
a
minute
now
he
said
who
decides
that
they
re
supremely
wise
men
who
are
doing
this
arbitrary
ruling
let
any
group
come
to
power
by
whatever
means
and
they
ll
soon
tell
you
they
re
an
elite
but
let
s
get
back
to
new
delos
from
what
you
ve
said
so
far
the
people
are
held
in
a
condition
of
what
s
wrong
with
slavery
tog
said
mildly
he
all
but
glared
at
her
are
you
kidding
i
seldom
jest
tog
said
primly
under
the
proper
conditions
slavery
can
be
the
most
suitable
system
for
a
under
conditions
have
you
forgotten
your
earth
history
to
the
point
where
egypt
greece
and
rome
mean
nothing
to
you
man
made
some
of
his
outstanding
progress
under
slavery
and
do
you
contend
that
man
s
lot
is
necessarily
miserable
given
slavery
as
far
back
as
aesop
we
know
of
slaves
who
have
reached
the
heights
in
their
society
slaves
sometimes
could
and
did
become
the
virtual
rulers
in
ancient
she
shrugged
prettily
the
prejudices
which
you
hold
today
on
earth
do
not
necessarily
apply
to
all
time
nor
to
all
he
said
impatiently
look
tog
we
can
go
into
this
further
later
let
s
get
back
to
new
delos
what
happened
tog
said
the
very
foundation
of
their
theocracy
is
the
belief
on
the
part
of
the
populace
that
the
is
immortal
no
man
conspires
against
his
deity
supervisor
jakes
informed
me
that
it
is
understood
by
up
intelligence
that
about
once
every
twenty
years
the
priesthood
secretly
puts
in
a
new
plastic
surgery
would
guarantee
facial
resemblance
and
of
course
the
rank
and
file
citizen
would
probably
never
be
allowed
close
enough
to
discover
that
their
seemed
different
every
couple
of
decades
at
any
rate
it
s
been
working
for
some
and
there
s
been
no
revolt
against
this
religious
aristocracy
she
shook
her
head
evidently
not
it
takes
a
brave
man
to
revolt
against
both
his
king
and
his
god
at
the
same
but
what
happened
now
ronny
pursued
evidently
right
in
the
midst
of
a
particularly
important
religious
ceremony
with
practically
the
whole
planet
watching
on
tv
the
was
killed
with
a
bomb
no
doubt
about
it
definitely
killed
there
are
going
to
be
a
lot
of
people
on
new
delos
wondering
how
it
can
be
that
an
immortal
can
and
sid
thinks
it
s
tommy
paine
s
work
she
shifted
dainty
shoulders
in
a
shrug
it
s
the
sort
of
thing
he
does
i
suppose
we
ll
learn
when
we
get
even
on
the
fast
space
forces
cruiser
the
trip
was
going
to
take
a
week
and
there
was
precious
little
ronny
bronston
could
do
until
arrival
he
spent
most
of
his
time
reading
up
on
new
delos
and
the
several
other
planets
in
the
up
organization
which
had
fairly
similar
regimes
more
than
a
few
theocracies
had
come
and
gone
during
the
history
of
man
s
development
into
the
stars
he
also
spent
considerable
time
playing
battle
chess
or
talking
with
tog
and
with
the
ship
s
officers
these
latter
were
a
dedicated
group
high
in
morale
enthusiastic
about
their
work
which
evidently
involved
the
combined
duties
of
a
navy
a
coast
guard
and
a
coast
and
geodetic
survey
system
if
we
use
the
ocean
going
services
of
an
earlier
age
for
analogy
they
all
had
the
dream
the
enthusiasm
of
men
participating
in
a
race
s
expansion
to
glory
there
was
the
feeling
even
stronger
here
in
space
than
back
on
earth
of
man
s
destiny
being
fulfilled
that
humanity
had
finally
emerged
from
its
infancy
that
the
fledgling
had
finally
found
its
wings
and
got
off
the
ground
after
one
of
his
studying
binges
ronny
bronston
had
spent
an
hour
or
so
once
with
the
captain
of
the
craft
while
that
officer
stood
an
easy
watch
on
the
ship
s
bridge
there
was
little
enough
to
do
in
space
practically
nothing
but
there
was
always
an
officer
on
watch
they
leaned
back
in
the
acceleration
chairs
before
the
ship
s
controls
and
ronny
listened
to
the
other
s
space
lore
stories
of
far
planets
as
yet
untouched
stories
of
planets
that
had
seemingly
been
suitable
for
colonization
but
had
proved
disastrous
for
man
for
this
reason
or
that
ronny
said
and
never
in
all
this
time
have
we
run
into
a
life
form
that
has
proved
intelligent
captain
woiski
said
no
not
that
i
know
of
there
was
an
animal
on
of
about
the
mental
level
of
the
chimpanzee
so
far
as
i
know
that
s
the
nearest
to
ronny
said
that
s
a
new
there
was
an
affectionate
gleam
in
the
captain
s
eye
yes
he
said
if
and
when
i
retire
i
think
that
d
be
the
planet
of
my
choice
if
i
could
get
permission
to
leave
earth
of
ronny
scowled
in
attempted
memory
now
that
you
mention
it
i
think
i
did
see
it
listed
the
other
day
among
planets
with
a
theocratic
the
captain
grunted
protest
if
you
re
comparing
it
to
this
new
delos
you
re
going
to
you
re
wrong
there
can
be
theocracy
and
theocracy
i
suppose
actually
i
imagine
has
the
most
well
government
in
the
ronny
was
interested
his
recent
studies
hadn
t
led
him
to
much
respect
for
a
priesthood
in
political
power
what
s
the
particular
feature
that
s
seemed
to
have
gained
your
regard
moderation
woiski
chuckled
they
carry
it
almost
to
the
point
of
immoderation
but
not
quite
briefly
it
works
something
like
this
they
have
a
limited
number
of
suppose
you
d
call
spend
their
time
at
whatever
moves
them
at
the
arts
at
scientific
research
at
religious
religion
will
students
of
anything
and
everything
and
at
the
governing
of
they
make
a
point
of
enjoying
the
luxuries
in
moderation
and
aren
t
a
severe
drain
on
the
rank
and
file
citizens
of
the
ronny
said
i
have
a
growing
distrust
of
hierarchies
who
decides
who
is
to
become
a
monk
and
who
remain
a
member
of
the
rank
and
file
the
captain
said
a
series
of
the
best
tests
they
can
devise
to
determine
a
person
s
intelligence
and
aptitudes
from
earliest
youth
the
whole
populace
is
checked
and
rechecked
at
the
age
of
thirty
when
it
is
considered
that
a
person
has
become
adult
and
has
finished
his
basic
education
a
limited
number
are
offered
monkhood
not
all
want
ronny
thought
about
it
why
not
what
are
the
shortcomings
the
captain
shrugged
responsibility
i
the
monks
aren
t
allowed
sex
booze
that
sort
of
thing
i
good
heavens
why
not
in
moderation
of
and
they
live
on
a
higher
scale
no
no
not
at
all
don
t
misunderstand
the
planet
is
a
prosperous
one
exceedingly
prosperous
there
is
everything
needed
for
comfortable
existence
for
everyone
is
one
planet
where
the
pursuit
of
happiness
is
pursuable
by
captain
woiski
chuckled
again
ronny
said
it
sounds
good
enough
although
i
m
leery
of
benevolent
dictatorships
the
trouble
with
them
is
that
it
s
up
to
the
dictators
to
decide
what
s
benevolent
and
almost
always
nepotism
rears
its
head
favoritism
of
one
sort
or
another
how
long
will
it
be
before
one
of
your
moderate
monks
decides
he
ll
moderately
tinker
with
the
tests
or
whatever
just
to
be
sure
his
favorite
nephew
makes
the
grade
a
high
is
no
guarantee
of
the
captain
didn
t
disagree
that
s
always
possible
i
suppose
one
guard
against
it
in
this
case
is
the
matter
of
motive
the
of
being
a
monk
isn
t
as
great
as
all
that
materially
you
aren
t
particularly
better
off
than
any
one
else
you
have
more
leisure
that
s
true
but
actually
most
of
them
are
so
caught
up
in
their
studies
or
research
that
they
put
in
more
hours
of
endeavor
than
does
the
farmer
or
industrial
worker
on
well
ronny
said
let
s
just
hope
that
tommy
paine
never
hears
of
this
who
the
captain
said
ronny
bronston
reversed
his
engines
oh
nobody
important
a
guy
i
know
captain
woiski
scowled
seems
to
me
i
ve
heard
the
at
first
ronny
leaned
forward
with
quick
interest
perhaps
the
cruiser
s
skipper
had
a
lead
but
no
he
sank
back
into
his
chair
that
name
was
strictly
a
section
g
pseudonym
no
one
used
it
outside
the
department
and
he
d
already
said
too
much
by
using
the
term
at
all
ronny
said
idly
probably
two
different
people
i
think
i
ll
go
on
back
and
see
how
tog
is
tog
was
at
her
communicator
when
he
entered
the
tiny
ship
s
lounge
ronny
could
see
in
the
brilliant
little
screen
of
the
compact
device
the
grinning
face
of
sid
jakes
tog
looked
up
at
ronny
and
smiled
then
clicked
the
device
off
what
s
new
ronny
said
she
moved
graceful
shoulders
i
just
called
supervisor
jakes
evidently
there
s
complete
confusion
on
new
delos
mobs
are
storming
the
temples
in
the
capital
the
priests
tried
to
present
a
new
and
he
was
laughed
out
of
ronny
snorted
cynically
sounds
good
to
me
the
more
i
read
about
new
delos
and
its
and
his
priesthood
the
more
i
think
the
best
thing
that
ever
happened
to
the
planet
was
this
showing
them
tog
looked
at
him
the
sides
of
her
mouth
tucking
down
as
usual
when
she
was
going
to
contradict
something
he
said
it
sounds
bad
to
me
she
said
tommy
paine
s
work
is
done
he
ll
be
off
to
some
other
place
and
we
won
t
get
there
in
time
to
snare
ronny
considered
that
it
was
probably
true
i
wonder
he
said
slowly
if
it
s
possible
for
us
to
get
a
list
of
all
ships
that
have
blasted
off
since
the
assassination
all
ships
and
their
destination
from
new
the
idea
grew
in
him
look
it
s
possible
that
a
dictatorial
government
such
as
theirs
would
immediately
quarantine
every
spaceport
on
the
tog
said
there
s
only
one
spaceport
on
new
delos
the
priesthood
didn
t
encourage
trade
or
even
communication
with
the
outside
didn
t
want
its
people
holy
smokes
ronny
blurted
it
s
possible
that
tommy
paine
s
on
that
planet
and
can
t
get
off
look
tog
see
if
you
can
raise
the
section
g
representative
on
new
delos
tog
said
demurely
i
already
have
taken
that
step
ronny
knowing
that
you
d
want
me
to
agent
mouley
hassan
has
promised
to
get
the
name
and
destination
of
every
passenger
that
leaves
new
ronny
sat
down
at
a
table
and
dialed
himself
a
mug
of
stout
drink
he
said
to
tog
possibly
we
ve
got
something
to
she
shook
her
head
disapprovingly
i
don
t
use
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
discussed
about
new
delos
they
simply
would
have
to
wait
until
their
arrival
ronny
switched
subjects
ever
hear
of
the
planet
he
asked
her
he
took
a
sip
of
his
brew
of
course
she
said
a
rather
small
planet
earth
type
within
four
degrees
noted
for
its
near
perfect
climate
and
its
scenic
captain
was
talking
about
it
ronny
said
sounds
like
a
regular
tog
made
a
negative
sound
well
what
s
wrong
with
ronny
said
impatiently
static
she
said
briefly
he
looked
at
her
it
sounds
to
me
as
though
it
s
developed
a
near
perfect
system
what
do
you
mean
static
no
push
no
drive
tog
said
definitely
is
the
old
term
has
it
made
the
place
is
stagnating
i
wouldn
t
be
surprised
to
see
tommy
paine
show
up
there
sooner
or
ronny
said
look
since
we
ve
known
each
other
have
i
ever
said
anything
you
agree
with
tog
raised
her
delicate
eyebrows
why
ronny
you
know
perfectly
well
we
both
agreed
that
the
eggs
for
breakfast
were
quite
ronny
came
to
his
feet
again
considering
her
size
she
certainly
was
an
irritating
baggage
i
think
i
ll
go
to
my
room
and
see
if
i
can
get
any
inspirations
on
tracking
down
our
good
night
ronny
she
said
demurely
they
ran
into
a
minor
difficulty
upon
arrival
at
new
delos
the
captain
called
both
ronny
bronston
and
tog
lee
chang
chu
to
the
bridge
he
nodded
in
the
direction
of
the
communications
screen
a
bald
headed
robed
a
at
them
captain
woiski
said
the
informs
me
that
the
provisional
government
has
ruled
that
any
spacecraft
landing
on
new
delos
can
not
take
off
again
without
permission
and
that
every
individual
who
lands
even
united
planets
personnel
will
need
an
exit
visa
before
being
allowed
to
ronny
said
then
you
can
t
land
the
captain
said
reasonably
my
destination
is
merlini
i
ve
gone
out
of
my
way
slightly
to
drop
you
off
here
but
i
can
t
afford
to
take
the
chance
of
having
my
ship
tied
up
for
what
might
be
an
indefinite
period
evidently
there
s
considerably
civil
disorder
down
from
the
screen
the
priest
snapped
that
is
an
inaccurate
manner
of
describing
the
sorry
the
captain
said
dryly
ronny
bronston
said
desperately
but
captain
miss
tog
and
i
simply
have
to
he
reached
for
his
badge
high
priority
bureau
of
the
captain
shrugged
his
hefty
shoulders
sorry
i
have
no
instructions
that
allow
me
to
risk
tying
up
my
ship
here
s
a
possibility
can
you
pilot
a
landing
craft
i
could
spare
you
one
then
you
and
your
assistant
would
be
the
only
ones
involved
you
could
turn
it
over
to
whatever
space
forces
base
we
have
ronny
said
miserably
no
i
m
not
a
space
i
am
tog
said
softly
the
idea
sounds
we
shall
expect
you
the
said
the
screen
went
blank
tog
lee
chang
chu
piloted
a
landing
craft
with
the
same
verve
that
she
seemed
to
be
able
to
handle
any
other
responsibility
as
he
sat
in
the
seat
next
to
her
ronny
bronston
took
in
her
practiced
flicking
of
the
controls
from
the
side
of
his
eyes
he
wondered
vaguely
at
the
efficiency
of
such
section
g
officials
as
metaxa
and
jakes
that
they
would
assign
an
unknown
quality
such
as
himself
to
a
task
as
important
as
running
down
tommy
paine
and
then
as
an
assistant
provide
him
with
an
experienced
operative
such
as
tog
the
bureaucratic
mind
can
be
a
dilly
he
decided
was
the
fact
that
she
was
a
rather
delicately
constructed
girl
a
factor
he
felt
the
weight
of
the
gun
nestled
under
his
left
armpit
perhaps
in
the
clutch
section
g
preferred
men
as
agents
they
swooped
into
a
landing
that
brought
them
as
close
to
the
control
tower
as
was
practical
in
a
matter
of
moments
there
was
a
guard
of
twenty
or
more
sloppily
uniformed
men
about
their
small
craft
tog
made
a
move
welcoming
committee
she
said
illustration
they
climbed
out
the
circular
port
and
flashed
their
united
planets
bureau
of
investigation
badges
to
the
youngish
looking
soldier
who
seemed
in
command
he
was
indecisive
united
planets
he
said
all
i
know
is
i
m
supposed
to
arrest
anybody
ronny
snapped
we
re
to
be
taken
immediately
to
united
planets
well
i
don
t
know
about
that
i
don
t
take
orders
from
one
of
his
men
was
nervously
fingering
the
trigger
of
his
submachine
gun
ronny
s
mouth
went
dry
he
had
the
feeling
of
being
high
high
on
a
rock
face
inadequately
belayed
from
above
tog
said
smoothly
but
major
i
m
sure
whoever
issued
your
orders
had
no
expectation
of
a
special
delegation
from
the
united
planets
coming
to
congratulate
your
new
authorities
on
their
success
of
course
it
s
unknown
to
arrest
a
delegation
from
united
it
is
he
frowned
at
her
i
mean
you
are
yes
tog
said
sweetly
ronny
took
the
hint
where
can
we
find
a
vehicle
major
to
get
us
to
the
capital
and
to
united
planets
headquarters
evidently
we
arrived
before
we
were
expected
there
should
have
been
a
big
welcoming
committee
oh
the
obviously
recently
promoted
lad
said
hesitantly
well
i
suppose
we
can
make
arrangements
this
way
he
grinned
at
tog
as
they
walked
toward
the
administration
building
do
all
girls
dress
like
you
on
earth
well
no
she
said
demurely
that
s
too
bad
he
said
gallantly
why
major
tog
said
keeping
her
eyes
on
the
tarmac
at
the
administration
building
there
was
little
of
order
but
eventually
they
managed
to
arrange
for
their
transportation
luckily
they
were
supplied
with
a
chauffeur
driven
luckily
because
without
the
chauffeur
to
help
them
run
the
gauntlet
they
would
have
been
held
up
by
parades
demonstrations
and
monstrous
street
meetings
a
dozen
times
before
they
ever
reached
their
destination
twice
ronny
stopped
short
of
drawing
his
gun
only
by
a
fraction
when
half
drunken
demonstrators
stopped
them
the
driver
a
wispy
sad
looking
type
shook
his
head
there
s
no
going
back
now
he
told
them
over
his
shoulder
no
going
back
last
week
i
was
all
with
the
rest
i
never
did
believe
david
the
one
was
really
immortal
but
you
was
just
used
to
the
idea
see
it
d
always
been
that
way
with
the
priests
running
everything
and
we
was
used
to
it
now
i
wish
we
was
still
that
way
at
least
you
knew
how
you
stood
see
now
what
s
going
to
happen
that
s
an
interesting
question
tog
said
politely
ronny
said
possibly
you
ll
have
the
chance
to
build
a
better
world
the
driver
shot
a
contemptuous
look
over
his
shoulder
better
world
what
do
i
want
with
a
better
world
i
just
don
t
want
to
be
bothered
i
ve
been
getting
my
three
squares
a
day
got
a
nice
little
flat
for
my
family
how
do
i
know
it
s
not
going
to
be
a
worse
world
that
s
always
a
possibility
tog
told
him
do
most
people
seem
to
feel
the
same
practically
everybody
i
know
does
he
said
glumly
but
the
fat
s
in
the
fire
now
the
priests
are
trying
to
hold
on
but
their
government
is
falling
apart
all
over
the
well
ronny
said
at
least
you
can
figure
just
about
anything
in
the
way
of
a
new
government
will
be
better
than
one
based
on
superstition
and
inquisition
it
couldn
t
get
things
can
always
get
worse
the
other
contradicted
him
sadly
they
left
the
cab
before
an
impressively
tall
many
windowed
building
in
city
center
as
they
mounted
the
steps
ronny
frowned
at
her
you
seemed
to
be
encouraging
that
man
in
his
pessimism
so
far
as
i
can
see
the
best
thing
that
ever
happened
to
this
planet
was
toppling
that
phony
perhaps
she
said
agreeably
however
the
man
s
mind
was
an
ossified
one
a
surprisingly
large
percentage
of
people
have
them
especially
when
it
comes
to
institutions
such
as
religion
and
government
we
weren
t
going
to
be
able
to
teach
him
anything
but
it
was
possible
to
learn
from
ronny
grunted
his
disgust
what
could
we
possibly
learn
from
him
tog
said
mildly
we
could
learn
what
people
of
the
street
were
thinking
it
might
give
us
some
ideas
about
what
direction
the
new
government
will
they
approached
the
portals
of
the
building
and
were
halted
by
an
armed
space
forces
guard
of
half
a
dozen
men
their
sergeant
saluted
taking
in
their
obvious
clothing
identifications
please
he
said
briskly
they
showed
their
badges
and
were
passed
on
through
ronny
said
to
him
much
trouble
sergeant
the
other
shrugged
no
just
precautions
sir
we
ve
been
here
only
three
or
four
weeks
civil
disturbance
we
re
used
to
it
were
over
on
montezuma
two
basic
months
ago
now
there
was
trouble
had
to
shoot
our
way
tog
called
coming
ronny
i
have
this
elevator
he
followed
her
scowling
an
idea

trying
to
work
its
way
through
somehow
he
missed
getting

headquarters
of
the
department
of
justice
were
on
the
eighth
floor
a
receptionist
clerk
led
them
through
three
or
four
doors
to
the
single
office
which
housed
section
a
red
eyed
exhausted
agent
looked
up
from
the
sole
desk
and
snarled
a
question
at
them
ronny
didn
t
get
it
but
tog
said
mildly
probationary
agent
ronald
bronston
and
tog
lee
chang
chu
on
special
she
flicked
open
her
badge
so
that
the
other
could
see
it
his
manner
changed
sorry
he
said
getting
up
to
shake
hands
i
m
mouley
hassan
in
charge
of
section
g
on
new
delos
we
ve
just
had
a
crisis
here
as
you
can
imagine
the
worst
of
it
s
now
he
added
sourly
i
hope
all
my
assistants
have
already
taken
off
for
he
was
a
short
statured
dark
complected
man
his
features
betraying
his
semitic
background
ronny
shook
hands
with
him
and
said
sorry
to
bother
you
at
a
time
like
they
found
chairs
and
mouley
hassan
flicked
a
key
on
his
order
box
and
said
to
them
how
about
a
drink
they
make
a
wonderful
sparkling
wine
on
this
planet
trust
any
theocracy
to
have
top
ronny
accepted
the
offer
tog
refused
it
politely
she
sat
demurely
her
hands
in
her
lap
mouley
hassan
ran
a
weary
hand
through
already
mussed
hair
what
s
this
special
assignment
you
re
on
ronny
said
commissioner
metaxa
has
sent
me
looking
for
tommy
tommy
paine
the
other
blurted
at
a
time
like
this
when
i
haven
t
had
three
nights
sleep
in
the
last
three
basic
weeks
you
come
around
looking
for
tommy
paine
ronny
was
taken
aback
sid
jakes
seemed
to
think
this
might
be
one
of
paine
s
tog
said
mildly
what
better
place
to
look
for
tommy
paine
than
in
a
situation
like
this
agent
hassan
her
eyebrows
went
up
or
don
t
you
think
the
quest
for
paine
is
an
important
one
the
other
subsided
somewhat
i
suppose
you
re
right
he
said
i
m
deathly
tired
do
whatever
you
want
but
don
t
expect
much
from
tog
said
just
a
trifle
tartly
ronny
thought
we
ll
have
to
call
on
you
as
usual
agent
hassan
there
s
probably
no
single
job
in
section
g
more
important
than
the
pursuit
of
tommy
all
right
all
right
mouley
hassan
admitted
i
ll
how
long
have
you
been
away
from
earth
he
said
to
ronny
about
one
basic
oh
he
grunted
this
is
your
first
stop
eh
well
i
don
t
envy
you
your
he
brought
a
cool
bottle
from
a
delivery
drawer
in
the
desk
along
with
two
glasses
here
s
the
ronny
leaned
forward
to
accept
the
glass
this
situation
here
he
said
do
you
think
it
can
be
laid
to
paine
mouley
hassan
shrugged
wearily
i
don
t
ronny
sipped
the
drink
looking
at
the
tired
agent
over
the
glass
rim
from
what
we
understand
check
has
been
kept
on
all
persons
leaving
the
planet
since
the
check
is
right
there
s
only
one
ship
that
took
off
and
it
carried
nobody
except
my
assistants
if
you
ask
me
i
still
needed
them
but
some
brass
hat
back
on
earth
decided
they
were
more
necessary
over
on
he
was
disgusted
ronny
put
the
glass
down
you
mean
only
one
ship
s
left
this
planet
since
the
was
killed
that
s
right
it
was
like
pulling
teeth
to
get
the
how
many
men
aboard
mouley
hassan
looked
at
him
speculatively
crew
and
six
section
g
tog
said
brightly
why
that
means
then
that
either
tommy
paine
is
still
on
this
planet
or
he
s
one
of
the
passengers
or
crew
members
of
that
she
added
that
is
of
course
unless
he
had
a
private
craft
hidden
away
ronny
slumped
back
into
his
chair
as
some
of
the
ramifications
came
home
to
him
if
it
was
tommy
paine
at
all
he
said
mouley
hassan
nodded
that
s
always
a
he
finished
his
glass
and
looked
pleadingly
at
tog
look
i
have
work
if
i
can
finish
some
of
it
i
might
have
time
for
some
sleep
couldn
t
we
postpone
the
search
for
tommy
tog
said
nothing
to
him
ronny
came
to
his
feet
we
ll
get
along
a
couple
of
ideas
occur
to
me
i
ll
check
with
you
fine
the
agent
said
he
shook
hands
with
them
again
he
said
somehow
more
to
tog
than
to
ronny
i
know
how
important
your
job
is
it
s
just
that
i
ve
been
pushed
to
the
point
where
i
can
t
operate
she
smiled
her
understanding
gave
him
her
small
delicate
hand
in
the
elevator
ronny
said
to
her
why
should
this
sort
of
thing
particularly
affect
section
g
tog
said
it
s
times
like
this
that
planets
drop
out
of
the
up
or
possibly
get
into
the
hands
of
some
jingoistic
military
group
and
start
off
halfcocked
to
provoke
a
war
with
some
other
planet
or
to
missionarize
or
propagandize
she
thought
about
it
a
moment
a
new
revolution
in
government
or
religion
seems
almost
invariably
to
want
to
spread
the
light
an
absolute
compulsion
to
bring
to
others
the
new
truths
that
they
ve
she
added
her
voice
holding
a
trace
of
mockery
usually
the
new
truths
are
rather
hoary
ones
and
there
are
few
interested
in
hearing
they
spent
their
first
day
in
getting
accommodations
in
a
centrally
located
hotel
in
making
arrangements
through
the
department
of
justice
for
the
local
means
of
turned
out
to
be
coinage
based
on
getting
the
feel
of
their
surroundings
evidently
delos
the
capital
city
of
the
planet
new
delos
was
but
slowly
emerging
from
the
chaos
that
had
taken
over
on
the
assassination
a
provisional
government
composed
of
representatives
of
half
a
dozen
different
organizations
which
had
sprung
up
like
mushrooms
following
the
collapse
of
the
regime
had
assumed
power
elections
had
been
promised
and
were
to
be
brought
off
when
arrangements
could
be
made
meanwhile
the
actual
government
was
still
largely
in
the
hands
of
the
lower
echelons
of
the
priesthood
a
nervous
priesthood
it
was
seemingly
desirous
of
getting
out
from
under
while
the
going
was
good
afraid
of
being
held
responsible
for
former
excesses
ronny
bronston
high
hopes
still
in
his
head
looked
up
the
who
had
given
them
landing
orders
while
they
were
still
aboard
the
space
forces
cruiser
tog
was
off
making
arrangements
for
various
details
involved
in
their
being
in
delos
in
its
time
of
crisis
a
dozen
times
on
his
way
over
to
keep
his
appointment
with
the
official
ronny
had
to
step
into
doorways
or
in
other
wise
make
himself
inconspicuous
gangs
of
demonstrators
roamed
the
street
some
of
them
drunken
looking
for
trouble
and
scornful
of
police
or
the
military
twice
when
it
looked
as
though
he
might
be
roughed
up
ronny
drew
his
gun
and
held
it
in
open
sight
ready
for
use
but
not
threateningly
the
demonstrators
made
off
his
throat
was
dry
by
the
time
he
reached
his
destination
the
life
of
a
section
g
agent
on
interplanetary
assignment
had
its
drawbacks
the
had
formerly
been
in
charge
of
interplanetary
communications
which
involved
commerce
as
well
as
intercourse
with
united
planets
it
must
have
been
an
position
only
a
month
ago
now
his
offices
were
all
but
deserted
he
looked
at
ronny
s
badge
only
vaguely
interested
section
g
of
the
bureau
of
investigation
he
said
i
don
t
believe
i
am
aware
of
your
responsibilities
however
he
nodded
with
sour
courtesy
please
be
seated
you
must
forgive
my
lack
of
ability
to
offer
refreshment
isn
t
there
an
old
tradition
about
rats
deserting
a
sinking
ship
i
am
afraid
my
former
assistants
had
rodentlike
ronny
said
section
g
deals
with
interplanetary
security
i
am
addressed
as
holiness
the
other
said
ronny
looked
at
him
sorry
he
said
i
am
a
citizen
of
the
united
planets
not
any
one
planet
even
earth
up
citizens
have
complete
religious
freedom
in
my
case
i
am
unaffiliated
with
any
the
let
it
pass
he
said
sourly
i
am
afraid
that
even
here
on
new
delos
i
am
seldom
honoured
by
my
title
any
more
go
on
you
say
you
deal
with
interplanetary
that
s
correct
in
cases
like
this
we
re
interested
in
checking
to
see
if
there
is
any
possibility
that
citizens
of
planets
other
than
new
delos
are
involved
in
your
internal
the
other
s
eyes
were
suddenly
slits
he
said
heavily
you
suspect
that
david
the
one
was
assassinated
by
an
alien
ronny
had
to
tread
carefully
here
i
make
no
such
suggestion
i
am
merely
here
to
check
on
the
possibility
if
such
was
the
case
my
duty
would
be
to
arrest
the
man
or
if
we
got
hold
of
him
you
d
have
small
chance
of
asserting
your
authority
the
priest
growled
what
did
you
want
to
know
i
understand
that
no
interplanetary
craft
have
left
new
delos
since
the
none
except
a
united
planets
ship
which
was
carefully
ronny
said
tightly
but
what
facilities
do
you
have
to
check
on
secret
spaceports
possibly
located
in
some
remote
desert
or
mountain
area
the
new
delian
laughed
sourly
there
is
no
other
planet
in
all
the
united
planets
with
our
degree
of
security
we
even
imported
the
most
recent
developments
in
artificial
satellites
equipped
with
the
most
delicate
of
detection
devices
i
assure
you
it
is
utterly
impossible
for
a
spacecraft
to
land
or
take
off
from
new
delos
without
our
ronny
bronston
s
eyes
lit
with
excitement
these
security
measures
of
yours
to
what
extent
do
you
keep
under
observation
all
aliens
on
the
planet
the
priest
s
chuckle
had
a
nasty
quality
you
are
quite
ignorant
of
our
institutions
evidently
every
person
on
new
delos
in
every
way
of
life
was
under
constant
survey
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
aliens
were
highly
discouraged
when
they
appeared
on
new
delos
at
all
they
were
restricted
in
their
movements
to
this
our
capital
ronny
let
air
whistle
from
his
lungs
then
he
said
triumphantly
if
any
alien
had
anything
to
do
with
this
he
is
still
on
the
planet
can
you
get
me
a
list
of
all
aliens
the
other
laughed
again
still
sourly
but
there
are
none
none
except
you
employees
of
united
planets
i
m
afraid
you
re
on
a
ronny
stared
at
him
blankly
but
commercial
representatives
cultural
the
priest
said
flatly
no
none
at
all
all
commerce
was
handled
through
up
we
encouraged
no
cultural
exchanges
we
wished
to
keep
our
people
uncorrupted
united
planets
alone
had
the
right
to
land
on
our
one
the
section
g
agent
came
to
his
feet
this
was
much
simpler
than
he
could
ever
have
hoped
for
he
thanked
the
other
but
avoided
the
necessity
of
shaking
hands
and
left
he
found
a
and
dialed
it
to
the
up
building
finding
strange
the
necessity
of
slipping
coins
into
the
vehicle
s
slots
until
the
correct
amount
for
his
destination
had
been
deposited
coinage
was
no
longer
in
use
on
earth
at
the
up
building
he
retraced
his
steps
of
the
day
before
to
the
single
office
of
section
to
his
surprise
not
only
mouley
hassan
was
there
but
tog
as
well
hassan
had
evidently
had
at
least
a
few
hours
of
sleep
he
was
in
better
shape
they
exchanged
the
usual
amenities
and
took
their
chairs
again
hassan
said
we
were
just
gossiping
it
s
been
years
since
i
ve
been
in
greater
washington
lee
chang
tells
me
that
sid
jakes
is
now
a
supervisor
i
worked
with
him
for
a
while
when
i
first
joined
section
how
about
a
glass
of
wine
ronny
said
look
if
tommy
paine
was
connected
with
this
and
it
s
almost
positive
he
was
we
ve
got
the
others
looked
at
him
you
ve
evidently
been
busy
tog
said
mildly
he
turned
to
her
he
s
trapped
tog
he
can
t
get
off
the
mouley
hassan
rubbed
a
hand
through
his
hair
it
d
be
hard
all
right
they
ve
got
the
people
under
rein
here
such
as
you
ve
never
seen
before
or
they
did
until
this
blew
ronny
sketched
the
situation
to
tog
winding
up
with
the
only
thing
that
makes
sense
is
that
it
s
a
tommy
paine
job
the
local
citizens
would
never
have
been
able
to
get
their
hands
on
such
a
bomb
or
been
able
to
have
made
the
arrangements
for
its
delivery
they
re
under
too
much
tog
said
thoughtfully
but
how
did
he
escape
all
this
surveillance
don
t
you
understand
he
s
working
here
in
this
building
as
an
employee
of
up
there
is
no
other
they
stared
at
him
i
think
perhaps
you
re
right
tog
said
finally
ronny
turned
to
mouley
hassan
can
you
get
a
list
of
all
up
employees
of
he
flicked
his
order
box
barked
a
command
into
it
ronny
said
it
s
going
to
be
a
matter
of
eliminating
the
impossible
for
instance
what
is
the
earliest
known
case
of
tommy
paine
s
activity
tog
thought
back
so
far
as
we
know
definitely
about
years
fine
ronny
said
increasingly
excited
that
will
eliminate
all
persons
less
than
say
forty
years
of
age
we
can
assume
he
was
at
least
twenty
when
he
hassan
said
can
we
eliminate
all
women
employees
ronny
said
i
d
think
so
the
few
times
he
s
been
seen
all
reports
are
of
a
man
and
that
case
on
the
planet
mother
where
he
put
himself
over
as
a
holy
man
he
could
hardly
have
been
a
woman
in
disguise
in
a
stone
age
culture
such
as
hassan
said
and
this
tommy
paine
has
been
flitting
around
this
part
of
the
galaxy
for
years
so
anyone
who
has
been
here
steadily
for
a
period
of
even
a
couple
of
years
or
so
can
t
be
mouley
hassan
thrust
his
hand
into
a
delivery
drawer
and
brought
forth
a
handful
of
punched
cards
possibly
fifty
in
all
surely
there
s
more
people
than
that
working
in
this
building
ronny
protested
mouley
hassan
said
no
i
ve
eliminated
already
everyone
who
is
a
citizen
of
new
delos
obviously
tommy
paine
is
an
alien
we
have
only
earthlings
and
other
united
planets
citizens
working
he
carried
the
cards
to
a
small
collator
and
worked
for
a
moment
on
its
controls
as
tog
and
ronny
watched
him
with
mounting
tension
let
s
see
he
muttered
we
eliminate
all
women
all
those
less
than
forty
all
who
haven
t
done
a
great
deal
of
travel
those
who
have
been
here
for
several
the
end
of
it
was
that
they
eliminated
everyone
employed
in
the
up
building
the
cards
were
stacked
back
on
mouley
hassan
s
desk
again
and
the
three
of
them
sat
around
and
looked
glumly
at
them
ronny
said
he
s
tinkered
with
the
files
he
counterfeited
fake
papers
for
himself
or
something
possibly
he
s
pulled
his
own
card
and
it
isn
t
in
this
stack
you
mouley
hassan
said
we
ll
all
those
possibilities
but
you
re
wrong
possibly
a
few
hundred
years
ago
but
not
today
forgery
and
counterfeiting
are
things
of
the
past
and
believe
me
the
bureau
of
investigation
and
especially
section
g
may
look
on
the
slipshod
side
but
they
aren
t
we
re
not
going
to
find
anything
wrong
with
those
cards
tommy
paine
simply
is
not
working
for
up
on
new
then
ronny
said
there
s
only
one
alternative
he
s
on
this
up
ship
going
to
what
was
the
name
of
its
destination
avalon
mouley
hassan
said
his
face
thoughtful
tog
said
do
you
have
any
ideas
on
the
men
aboard
mouley
hassan
said
there
were
four
crew
men
and
six
of
our
tog
said
unless
one
of
them
has
faked
papers
the
six
agents
are
eliminated
that
leaves
the
crew
members
do
you
know
anything
about
them
hassan
shook
his
head
ronny
said
let
s
communicate
with
avalon
tell
our
representatives
there
to
be
sure
that
none
of
the
occupants
of
that
ship
leaves
avalon
until
we
get
mouley
hassan
said
good
he
turned
to
his
screen
and
said
into
it
section
g
bureau
of
investigation
on
the
planet
in
moment
the
screen
lit
up
an
elderly
agent
as
section
g
agents
seemed
to
go
looked
up
at
them
mouley
hassan
held
his
silver
badge
so
the
other
could
see
it
and
on
the
avalon
agent
s
nod
said
i
m
hassan
from
new
delos
we
ve
just
had
a
crisis
here
and
there
seems
to
be
a
chance
that
it
s
a
tommy
paine
job
agent
bronston
here
is
on
an
assignment
tracking
him
down
i
ll
turn
it
over
to
the
avalon
agent
nodded
again
and
looked
at
ronny
ronny
said
urgently
we
haven
t
the
time
to
give
you
details
but
every
indication
is
that
paine
is
on
a
up
spacecraft
with
avalon
as
its
destination
there
are
only
ten
men
aboard
and
six
of
them
are
section
g
the
other
pursed
his
lips
i
see
you
think
you
have
the
old
fox
cornered
eh
possibly
ronny
said
there
are
various
ifs
miss
tog
and
i
can
double
check
here
then
as
soon
as
we
can
clear
exit
visas
we
ll
make
immediate
way
for
the
avalon
section
g
agent
said
i
haven
t
the
authority
to
control
the
movements
of
other
agents
they
have
as
high
rank
as
i
have
he
added
expressionlessly
and
probably
higher
than
ronny
said
but
the
crew
the
other
said
these
men
are
coming
to
avalon
to
work
on
a
job
that
will
take
at
least
six
months
we
ll
make
a
routine
check
and
i
ll
try
and
make
sure
the
whole
ten
will
still
be
on
avalon
when
and
if
you
they
had
to
be
satisfied
with
that
they
checked
all
ways
from
the
middle
nor
did
it
take
long
there
was
no
doubt
if
this
was
a
tommy
paine
job
and
it
almost
surely
was
then
there
was
only
one
way
in
which
he
could
have
escaped
from
the
planet
and
that
was
by
the
single
spacecraft
that
had
left
destination
avalon
he
was
not
on
the
planet
that
was
definite
ronny
felt
a
stranger
on
new
delos
was
as
conspicuous
as
a
walrus
in
a
goldfish
bowl
there
simply
were
no
such
they
spent
most
of
their
time
checking
and
rechecking
united
planets
personnel
but
there
was
no
question
there
either
mouley
hassan
and
others
of
up
personnel
helped
cut
the
red
tape
involved
in
getting
exit
visas
from
new
delos
it
wasn
t
as
complicated
as
it
might
have
been
a
week
or
two
before
no
one
seemed
to
be
so
confident
of
his
authority
in
the
new
provisional
government
that
he
dared
veto
a
united
planets
request
mouley
hassan
was
able
to
arrange
for
a
small
space
yacht
slower
than
a
military
craft
but
capable
of
getting
them
to
avalon
in
a
few
days
time
a
crew
was
sufficient
ronny
and
especially
tog
could
spell
him
on
the
watches
time
aboard
was
spent
largely
in
studying
up
on
avalon
going
over
and
over
again
anything
known
about
the
elusive
tommy
paine
and
playing
battle
chess
and
bickering
with
tog
lee
chang
chu
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
this
ability
to
argue
against
just
about
anything
ronny
managed
to
say
he
could
have
been
attracted
to
her
to
the
detriment
of
the
job
she
was
a
good
traveler
few
people
are
she
was
an
assistant
she
was
a
joy
to
look
at
and
she
never
intruded
but
great
guns
the
woman
could
bicker
the
two
of
them
were
studying
in
the
ship
s
luxurious
lounge
when
ronny
looked
up
and
said
do
you
have
any
idea
why
those
six
agents
were
sent
to
avalon
no
she
said
he
indicated
the
booklet
he
was
reading
from
what
i
can
see
here
it
sounds
like
one
of
the
most
advanced
planets
in
the
up
they
ve
made
some
of
the
most
useful
advances
in
industrial
techniques
of
the
past
oh
i
don
t
know
tog
mused
i
haven
t
much
regard
for
industrial
feudalism
myself
it
starts
off
with
a
bang
but
tends
to
go
industrial
feudalism
he
said
indignantly
what
do
you
mean
the
government
is
a
constitutional
monarchy
with
the
king
merely
a
powerless
symbol
the
standard
of
living
is
high
elections
are
honest
and
democratic
they
ve
got
a
system
which
is
largely
phony
tog
interrupted
you
ve
got
to
do
some
reading
between
the
lines
especially
when
the
books
you
re
reading
are
turned
out
by
the
industrial
feudalistic
publishing
companies
in
what
s
this
industrial
feudalism
you
keep
talking
about
avalon
has
a
system
of
free
a
gobbledygook
term
tog
said
irritatingly
industrial
feudalism
is
a
system
that
develops
when
industrial
wealth
is
concentrated
into
the
hands
of
a
comparatively
few
families
it
finally
gets
to
the
point
of
a
closed
circle
all
but
impossible
to
break
into
these
industrial
feudalistic
families
become
so
powerful
that
only
in
rare
instances
can
anyone
lift
himself
into
their
society
they
dominate
every
field
including
the
labor
unions
which
amount
to
one
of
the
biggest
businesses
of
all
with
their
unlimited
resources
they
even
own
every
means
of
dispensing
you
mean
ronny
argued
that
on
avalon
you
can
t
start
up
a
newspaper
of
your
own
and
say
whatever
you
wish
certainly
you
can
theoretically
if
you
have
the
resources
unfortunately
such
enterprises
become
increasingly
expensive
to
start
or
you
could
start
a
radio
tv
or
you
had
the
resources
however
even
if
you
overcame
all
your
handicaps
and
your
newspaper
or
broadcasting
station
became
a
success
the
industrial
feudalistic
families
in
control
of
avalon
s
publishing
and
broadcasting
fields
have
the
endless
resources
to
buy
you
out
or
squeeze
you
out
by
one
nasty
means
or
ronny
snorted
well
the
people
must
be
satisfied
or
they
d
vote
some
fundamental
tog
nodded
they
re
satisfied
and
no
wonder
since
childhood
every
means
of
forming
their
opinions
have
been
in
the
hands
of
industrial
feudalistic
the
you
mean
the
schools
are
private
no
they
don
t
have
to
be
the
government
is
completely
dominated
by
the
fifty
or
so
families
which
for
all
practical
purposes
own
avalon
that
includes
the
schools
some
of
the
higher
institutions
of
learning
are
private
but
they
too
are
largely
dependent
upon
grants
from
the
ronny
was
irritated
by
her
air
he
tapped
the
book
he
d
been
reading
with
a
finger
they
don
t
control
the
government
avalon
s
got
a
system
any
time
the
people
don
t
like
the
government
they
can
vote
in
an
that
s
an
optical
illusion
there
are
three
parties
but
each
is
dominated
by
the
fifty
families
and
election
laws
are
such
that
for
all
practical
purposes
it
s
impossible
to
start
another
party
theoretically
it
s
possible
actually
it
isn
t
the
voters
can
vary
back
and
forth
between
the
three
political
parties
but
it
doesn
t
make
any
difference
which
one
they
elect
they
all
stand
for
the
same
continuation
of
the
status
then
you
claim
it
isn
t
democracy
at
all
tog
sighed
that
s
a
much
abused
word
actually
pure
democracy
is
seldom
seen
they
pretty
well
had
it
in
primitive
society
where
government
was
based
on
the
family
you
voted
for
one
of
your
relatives
in
your
clan
to
represent
you
in
the
tribal
councils
every
one
in
the
tribe
was
equal
so
far
as
apportionments
of
the
necessities
of
life
were
concerned
no
one
even
the
tribal
chiefs
ate
better
than
anyone
else
no
one
had
a
better
ronny
said
snappishly
and
if
man
had
remained
at
that
level
we
d
never
have
gotten
that
s
right
she
said
for
progress
man
needed
a
leisure
class
somebody
with
the
time
to
study
to
experiment
to
work
things
he
said
we
re
getting
away
from
the
point
you
said
in
spite
of
appearances
they
don
t
have
democracy
on
they
have
a
pretense
of
it
but
only
free
men
can
practice
democracy
so
long
as
your
food
clothing
and
shelter
are
controlled
by
someone
else
you
aren
t
free
wait
until
i
think
of
an
she
put
her
right
forefinger
to
her
chin
thoughtfully
holy
smokes
she
was
a
cute
trick
if
only
she
wasn
t
so
confounded
irritating
tog
said
do
you
remember
the
state
of
california
in
earth
history
i
think
so
on
the
west
coast
of
north
that
s
right
well
back
in
the
twentieth
century
christian
calendar
they
had
an
economic
depression
during
it
a
crackpot
organization
called
thirty
dollars
every
thursday
managed
to
get
itself
on
the
ballot
times
were
bad
enough
but
had
this
particular
bunch
got
into
power
it
would
have
become
chaotic
at
first
no
thinking
person
took
them
seriously
however
a
majority
of
people
in
california
at
that
time
had
little
to
lose
and
in
the
final
week
or
so
of
the
election
campaign
the
polls
showed
that
thirty
dollars
every
thursday
was
going
to
win
so
a
few
days
before
voting
many
of
the
larger
industries
and
businesses
in
the
state
ran
full
page
ads
in
the
newspapers
they
said
substantially
the
same
thing
thirty
dollars
every
thursday
wins
this
election
our
concern
will
close
its
doors
do
not
bother
to
come
back
to
work
ronny
was
scowling
at
her
what
s
your
point
she
shrugged
delicate
shoulders
the
crackpots
were
defeated
of
course
which
was
actually
good
for
california
but
my
point
is
that
the
voters
of
california
were
not
actually
free
since
their
livelihoods
were
controlled
by
others
this
is
an
extreme
case
of
course
but
the
fact
always
a
thought
suddenly
hit
ronny
bronston
look
he
said
tommy
paine
do
you
think
he
s
merely
escaping
from
new
delos
or
is
it
possible
that
avalon
is
his
next
destination
is
he
going
to
try
and
overthrow
the
government
there
she
was
shaking
her
head
but
frowning
i
don
t
think
so
things
are
quite
stable
on
stable
he
scowled
at
her
from
what
you
ve
been
saying
they
re
pretty
she
continued
to
shake
her
head
don
t
misunderstand
ronny
on
an
assignment
like
this
it
s
easy
to
get
the
impression
that
all
the
united
planets
are
in
a
state
of
confusion
but
it
isn
t
so
a
small
minority
of
planets
are
ripe
for
the
sort
of
trouble
tommy
paine
stirs
up
most
are
working
away
developing
making
progress
slowly
evolving
avalon
is
one
of
these
the
way
things
are
there
tommy
paine
couldn
t
make
a
dent
on
changing
things
even
if
he
wanted
to
and
there
s
no
particular
reason
to
believe
he
ronny
growled
from
what
i
can
learn
of
the
guy
he
s
anxious
to
stir
up
trouble
wherever
he
i
don
t
know
if
there
s
any
pattern
at
all
in
his
activities
it
seems
to
be
that
he
picks
spots
where
things
are
ripe
to
boil
over
on
their
own
he
acts
as
a
catalyst
in
a
place
like
avalon
he
wouldn
t
get
to
first
base
possibly
fifty
years
from
now
things
will
have
developed
on
avalon
to
the
point
where
there
is
dissatisfaction
by
that
time
she
said
dryly
we
ll
assume
tommy
paine
will
no
longer
be
a
problem
to
the
commissariat
of
interplanetary
affairs
for
one
reason
or
the
ronny
took
up
his
book
again
he
growled
i
can
t
figure
out
his
motivation
if
i
could
just
put
my
finger
on
for
once
she
agreed
with
him
i
ve
got
an
idea
ronny
that
once
you
have
that
you
ll
have
tommy
they
drew
blank
on
avalon
or
at
least
it
was
drawn
for
them
before
they
ever
arrived
the
section
g
agent
permanently
assigned
to
that
planet
had
already
checked
and
double
checked
the
possibilities
none
of
the
crew
of
the
up
spacecraft
had
been
on
new
delos
at
the
time
of
the
assassination
of
the
they
and
their
craft
had
been
away
on
another
job
ronny
bronston
couldn
t
believe
it
he
simply
couldn
t
believe
it
the
older
agent
his
name
was
jheru
bulchand
was
definite
he
went
over
it
with
ronny
and
tog
in
a
bar
adjoining
up
headquarters
he
had
dossiers
on
each
of
the
ten
men
detailed
dossiers
on
the
face
of
it
none
of
them
could
be
paine
but
one
of
them
has
to
be
ronny
pleaded
he
explained
their
method
of
eliminating
the
employees
of
up
on
new
delos
bulchand
shrugged
you
ve
got
holes
in
that
method
of
elimination
you
re
assuming
tommy
paine
is
an
individual
and
you
have
no
reason
to
my
own
theory
is
that
it
s
an
ronny
said
unhappily
then
you
re
of
the
opinion
that
there
is
a
tommy
paine
the
older
agent
was
puffing
comfortably
on
an
old
style
briar
pipe
he
nodded
definitely
i
believe
tommy
paine
exists
as
an
organization
possibly
once
originally
it
was
a
single
person
but
now
it
s
a
group
how
large
i
wouldn
t
know
probably
not
too
large
or
by
this
time
somebody
would
have
betrayed
it
or
somebody
would
have
cracked
and
we
would
have
caught
them
catch
one
and
you
ve
got
the
whole
organization
what
with
our
modern
means
of
tog
said
i
ve
heard
the
opinion
jheru
bulchand
pointed
at
ronny
with
his
pipe
stem
if
its
an
organization
then
none
of
that
eliminating
you
did
is
valid
your
assassin
could
have
been
one
of
the
women
he
could
have
been
one
of
the
men
you
eliminated
as
too
recently
admitted
to
the
tommy
paine
ronny
checked
the
last
of
his
theories
why
did
section
g
send
six
of
its
agents
here
nothing
to
do
with
tommy
paine
bulchand
said
it
s
a
different
sort
of
just
for
my
own
satisfaction
what
kind
of
crisis
bulchand
sketched
it
quickly
there
are
two
earth
type
planets
in
this
solar
system
avalon
was
the
first
to
be
colonized
and
developed
rapidly
after
a
couple
of
centuries
avalonians
went
over
and
settled
on
catalina
they
eventually
set
up
a
government
of
their
own
now
avalon
has
a
surplus
of
industrial
products
her
economic
system
is
such
that
she
produces
more
than
she
can
sell
back
to
her
own
people
there
s
a
tog
said
demurely
so
of
course
they
want
to
dump
it
in
bulchand
nodded
in
fact
they
re
willing
to
give
it
away
they
ve
offered
to
build
railroads
turn
over
ships
and
aircraft
donate
whole
factories
to
catalina
s
slowly
developing
ronny
said
well
how
does
that
call
for
section
g
agents
catalina
has
evoked
article
two
of
the
up
charter
no
member
planet
of
up
is
to
interfere
with
the
internal
political
or
religious
affairs
of
another
member
planet
avalon
claims
the
charter
doesn
t
apply
since
catalina
belongs
to
the
same
solar
system
and
since
she
s
a
former
colony
we
re
trying
to
smooth
the
whole
thing
over
before
avalon
dreams
up
some
excuse
for
military
ronny
stared
at
him
i
get
the
feeling
every
other
sentence
is
being
left
out
of
your
explanation
it
just
doesn
t
make
sense
in
the
first
place
why
is
avalon
as
anxious
as
all
that
to
give
away
what
sounds
like
a
fantastic
amount
of
goods
i
told
you
they
have
a
glut
they
ve
overproduced
and
as
a
result
they
ve
got
a
depression
on
their
hands
or
will
have
unless
they
find
well
why
not
trade
with
some
of
the
planets
that
want
her
products
tog
said
as
though
reasoning
with
a
youngster
planets
outside
her
own
solar
system
are
too
far
away
for
it
to
be
practical
even
if
she
had
commodities
they
didn
t
she
needs
a
nearby
planet
more
backward
than
herself
a
planet
like
well
that
brings
us
to
the
more
fantastic
question
why
in
the
world
doesn
t
catalina
accept
it
sounds
to
me
like
pure
philanthropy
on
the
part
of

his

in
a
negative
gesture
bronston
governments
are
never
motivated
by
idealistic
reasons
individuals
might
be
and
even
small
groups
but
governments
never
governments
including
that
of
avalon
exist
for
the
benefit
of
the
class
or
classes
that
control
them
the
only
things
that
motivate
them
are
the
interests
of
that
well
this
sounds
like
an
exception
ronny
said
argumentatively
how
can
catalina
lose
if
the
avalonians
grant
them
railroads
factories
and
all
the
rest
of
it
tog
said
don
t
you
see
ronny
it
gives
avalon
a
foothold
in
the
catalina
economy
when
the
locomotives
wear
out
on
the
railroad
new
engines
new
parts
must
be
purchased
they
won
t
be
available
on
catalina
because
there
will
be
no
railroad
industry
because
none
will
have
ever
grown
up
catalina
manufacturers
couldn
t
compete
with
that
initial
free
gift
they
ll
be
dependent
on
avalon
for
future
equipment
in
the
factories
when
machines
wear
out
they
will
be
replaceable
only
with
the
products
of
avalon
s
bulchand
said
there
s
an
analogy
in
the
early
history
of
the
united
states
when
its
fledgling
steel
industry
began
they
set
up
a
high
tariff
to
protect
it
against
british
competition
the
british
were
amazed
and
indignant
pointing
out
that
they
could
sell
american
steel
products
at
one
third
the
local
prices
if
only
allowed
to
do
so
the
united
states
said
no
thanks
it
didn
t
want
to
be
tied
industrially
to
great
britain
s
apron
strings
and
in
a
couple
of
decades
american
steel
production
passed
england
s
in
a
couple
of
more
decades
american
steel
production
was
many
times
that
of
england
s
and
she
was
taking
british
markets
away
from
her
all
over
the
at
any
rate
ronny
said
it
s
not
a
tommy
paine
just
for
luck
though
ronny
and
tog
double
checked
all
over
again
on
bulchand
s
efforts
they
interviewed
all
six
of
the
section
g
agents
each
of
them
carried
a
silver
badge
that
gleamed
only
for
the
individual
who
possessed
it
all
of
which
eliminated
the
possibility
that
paine
had
assumed
the
identity
of
a
section
g
operative
so
that
was
out
they
checked
the
four
crew
members
but
there
was
no
doubt
there
either
the
craft
had
been
far
away
at
the
time
of
the
assassination
on
new
delos
on
the
third
day
ronny
bronston
disgusted
knocked
on
the
door
of
tog
s
hotel
room
the
door
screen
lit
up
and
tog
looking
out
at
him
said
oh
come
on
in
ronny
i
was
just
talking
to
he
entered
tog
had
set
up
her
section
g
communicator
on
a
desk
top
and
sid
jakes
grinning
face
was
in
the
tiny
brilliant
screen
ronny
approached
close
enough
for
the
other
to
take
him
in
jakes
said
happily
hi
ronny
no
luck
eh
ronny
shook
his
head
trying
not
to
let
his
face
portray
his
feelings
of
defeat
this
after
all
was
a
probationary
assignment
and
the
supervisor
had
the
power
to
send
ronny
bronston
back
to
the
drudgery
of
his
office
job
at
population
statistics
still
working
on
it
i
suppose
it
s
a
matter
of
returning
to
new
delos
and
grinding
away
at
the
employees
of
the
up
sid
jakes
pursed
his
lips
i
don
t
know
possibly
this
whole
thing
was
a
false
alarm
at
any
rate
there
seems
to
be
a
hotter
case
on
the
fire
if
our
local
agents
have
it
straight
paine
is
about
to
pull
one
of
his
coups
on
kropotkin
this
is
a
of
course
one
of
the
few
times
we
ve
ever
detected
him
before
the
ronny
was
suddenly
alert
his
fatigue
of
disgust
of
but
a
moment
ago
completely
forgotten
where
he
said
kropotkin
jakes
said
one
of
the
most
backward
planets
in
up
and
seemingly
a
setup
for
paine
s
sort
of
trouble
making
the
authorities
if
you
can
use
the
term
applied
to
kropotkin
are
already
complaining
threatening
to
invoke
article
one
of
the
charter
or
to
resign
from
jake
looked
at
tog
again
do
you
know
kropotkin
lee
chang
she
shook
her
head
i
ve
heard
of
it
rather
vaguely
named
after
some
old
anarchist
i
that
s
the
place
one
of
the
few
anarchist
societies
in
up
you
don
t
hear
much
from
he
turned
to
ronny
again
i
think
that
s
your
bet
hop
to
it
boy
we
re
going
to
catch
this
tommy
paine
guy
or
organization
or
whatever
soon
or
united
planets
is
going
to
know
it
we
can
t
keep
the
lid
on
indefinitely
if
word
gets
around
of
his
activities
then
we
ll
lose
member
planets
like
christmas
trees
shedding
needles
after
new
year
he
grinned
widely
that
s
sounds
like
a
neat
trick
eh
ronny
bronston
had
got
to
the
point
where
he
avoided
controversial
subjects
with
tog
even
when
provoked
and
she
had
a
sneaky
little
way
of
provoking
arguments
they
had
only
one
really
knock
down
and
verbal
battle
on
the
way
to
kropotkin
it
had
started
innocently
enough
after
dinner
on
the
space
liner
on
which
they
had
taken
passage
for
the
first
part
of
the
trip
to
kill
time
they
were
playing
battle
chess
with
its
larger
board
and
added
contingents
of
pawns
and
castles
ronny
said
idly
you
know
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
i
m
a
third
generation
united
planets
citizen
and
employee
i
m
just
beginning
to
realize
how
far
out
some
of
our
member
planets
are
i
had
no
idea
she
frowned
in
concentration
before
moving
she
was
advancing
her
men
in
echelon
attack
taking
losses
in
exchange
for
territory
and
trying
to
pen
him
up
in
such
small
space
that
he
couldn
t
maneuver
she
said
how
do
you
mean
ronny
lifted
and
dropped
a
shoulder
well
new
delos
and
its
theocracy
for
instance
and
and
mother
and
some
of
the
other
planets
with
extremes
in
government
of
system
i
hadn
t
the
vaguest
idea
about
such
she
made
a
deprecating
sound
you
should
see
amazonia
or
for
that
matter
the
orwellian
he
said
does
that
mean
what
it
sounds
like
it
does
she
made
her
move
and
settled
back
in
satisfaction
her
pawns
were
in
such
position
that
his
bishops
were
both
unusable
he
d
tried
to
play
a
phalanx
game
in
the
early
stages
of
her
attack
but
she
d
broken
through
rolling
up
his
left
flank
after
sacrificing
a
castle
and
a
knight
certainly
does
she
said
a
fairly
recently
colonized
planet
a
few
thousand
feminists
no
men
at
onto
it
a
few
centuries
ago
and
it
s
still
an
out
and
out
ronny
cleared
his
throat
delicately
without
men
ah
how
did
they
continue
several
centuries
tog
suppressed
her
amusement
artificial
insemination
at
first
so
i
understand
they
brought
their
ah
supply
with
them
but
then
there
were
boys
among
the
first
generation
on
the
new
planet
and
even
the
amazonians
weren
t
up
to
cold
bloodedly
butchering
their
children
so
they
merely
enslaved
them
nice
ronny
stared
at
her
you
mean
all
men
are
automatically
slaves
on
this
planet
that
s
ronny
made
an
improperly
thought
out
move
trying
to
bring
up
a
castle
to
reinforce
his
collapsing
flank
he
said
up
allows
to
join
evidently
and
there
was
disgust
in
his
voice
why
not
she
said
mildly
well
there
should
be
tog
moved
quickly
dominating
with
a
knight
several
squares
he
couldn
t
afford
to
lose
she
looked
up
at
him
her
dark
eyes
sparking
the
point
of
up
is
to
include
all
the
planets
that
way
at
least
conflict
can
be
avoided
and
some
exchange
of
science
industrial
techniques
and
cultural
gains
take
place
and
you
must
remember
that
while
in
power
practically
no
system
will
admit
to
the
fact
that
it
could
possibly
change
for
the
better
but
actually
there
is
nothing
less
stable
systems
are
almost
always
in
a
condition
of
flux
planets
such
as
amazonia
might
for
a
time
seem
so
brutal
in
their
methods
as
to
exclude
their
right
to
civilized
intercourse
with
the
rest
however
one
of
these
days
there
ll
be
a
one
of
these
centuries
they
all
change
sooner
or
she
added
softly
even
han
ronny
said
her
voice
was
quiet
where
i
was
born
ronny
colonized
from
china
in
the
very
early
days
in
fact
i
spent
my
childhood
in
a
she
said
musingly
the
party
bureaucrats
thought
their
system
an
impregnable
unchangeable
one
your
ronny
was
fascinated
and
what
happened
he
was
in
full
retreat
now
and
with
nowhere
to
go
his
pieces
pinned
up
for
the
slaughter
he
moved
a
pawn
to
try
and
open
up
his
queen
why
don
t
you
concede
she
said
tommy
paine
paine
it
s
a
long
story
i
ll
tell
you
about
it
some
she
pressed
closer
with
her
own
queen
he
stared
disgustedly
at
the
board
well
that
s
what
i
mean
he
muttered
i
had
no
idea
there
were
so
many
varieties
of
crackpot
systems
among
the
up
they
re
not
necessarily
crackpot
she
protested
mildly
just
at
different
stages
of
not
crackpot
he
said
here
we
are
heading
for
a
planet
named
kropotkin
which
evidently
practices
your
move
she
said
what
s
wrong
with
anarchism
he
glowered
at
her
in
outraged
disgust
was
it
absolutely
impossible
for
him
to
say
anything
without
her
disagreement
tog
said
mildly
the
anarchistic
ethic
is
one
of
the
highest
man
has
ever
she
added
after
a
moment
of
pretty
consideration
unfortunately
admittedly
it
hasn
t
been
practical
to
put
to
practice
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
they
have
done
on
anarchist
ethic
yes
ronny
snapped
i
m
no
student
of
the
movement
but
the
way
i
understand
it
there
isn
t
tog
smiled
sweetly
the
belief
upon
which
they
base
their
teachings
is
that
no
man
is
capable
of
judging
ronny
cast
his
eyes
ceilingward
i
give
up
she
began
rapidly
resetting
the
pieces
another
game
she
said
brightly
hey
i
didn
t
mean
the
game
i
was
just
about
to
ha
she
said
the
section
g
agent
on
kropotkin
was
named
hideka
yamamoto
but
he
was
on
a
field
tour
and
wouldn
t
be
back
for
several
days
however
there
wasn
t
especially
any
great
hurry
so
far
as
ronny
bronston
and
tog
lee
chang
chu
knew
they
got
themselves
organized
in
the
rather
rustic
equivalent
of
a
hotel
which
was
located
fairly
near
up
headquarters
and
took
up
the
usual
problems
of
arranging
for
local
exchange
meals
means
of
transportation
and
such
necessities
it
was
a
greater
problem
than
usual
in
fact
hadn
t
it
been
for
the
presence
of
the
up
organization
which
had
already
gone
through
all
this
the
hard
way
some
of
the
difficulties
would
have
been
all
but
insurmountable
for
instance
there
was
no
local
exchange
there
was
no
medium
of
exchange
at
all
evidently
simple
barter
was
the
rule
in
the
it
could
be
called
a
ronny
bronston
looked
at
tog
anarchism
he
said
oh
great
the
highest
ethic
of
all
and
what
s
the
means
of
transportation
on
this
wonderful
planet
the
horse
and
how
are
we
going
to
get
a
couple
of
horses
with
no
means
of
exchange
she
tinkled
laughter
all
right
he
said
you
re
the
man
friday
you
find
out
the
details
and
handle
them
i
m
going
out
to
take
a
look
around
the
you
can
call
this
a
it
s
the
capital
of
kropotkin
tog
said
placatingly
though
with
a
mocking
background
in
her
tone
name
of
bakunin
and
very
pleasant
too
from
what
little
i
ve
seen
not
a
bit
of
smog
industrial
fumes
street
dirt
street
how
could
there
be
he
injected
disgustedly
there
isn
t
any
industry
there
aren
t
any
cars
and
for
all
practical
purposes
no
streets
the
houses
are
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
so
she
laughed
at
him
again
city
boy
she
said
go
on
out
there
and
enjoy
nature
a
little
it
ll
do
you
good
anybody
who
has
cooped
himself
up
in
that
one
big
city
earth
all
his
life
ought
to
enjoy
seeing
what
the
great
outdoors
looks
he
looked
at
her
and
grinned
she
was
cute
as
a
pixie
and
there
were
no
two
ways
about
that
he
wondered
for
a
moment
what
kind
of
a
wife
she
d
make
and
then
shuddered
inwardly
life
would
be
one
big
contradiction
of
anything
he
d
managed
to
get
out
of
his
trap
he
strolled
idly
along
what
was
little
more
than
a
country
path
and
it
came
to
him
that
there
were
probably
few
worlds
in
the
whole
up
where
he
d
have
been
prone
to
do
this
within
the
first
few
hours
he
d
been
on
the
planet
he
would
have
been
afraid
elsewhere
of
anything
from
footpads
to
police
from
unknown
vehicles
to
unknown
traffic
laws
there
was
something
bewildering
about
being
an
earthling
and
being
set
down
suddenly
in
new
delos
or
on
avalon
here
somehow
he
already
had
a
feeling
of
peace
evidently
although
bakunin
was
supposedly
a
city
its
populace
tilled
their
fields
and
provided
themselves
with
their
own
food
he
could
see
no
signs
of
stores
or
warehouses
and
the
up
building
which
was
no
great
edifice
itself
was
the
only
thing
in
town
which
looked
even
remotely
like
a
governmental
building
bakunin
was
neat
clean
as
a
pin
as
the
expression
went
ronny
was
vaguely
reminded
of
a
historical
romance
he
d
once
seen
it
had
been
laid
in
ancient
times
in
a
community
of
the
amish
in
old
pennsylvania
he
approached
one
of
the
wooden
houses
the
things
would
have
been
priceless
on
earth
as
an
antique
to
be
erected
as
a
museum
in
some
crowded
park
for
that
matter
it
would
have
been
priceless
for
the
wood
it
contained
evidently
the
planet
kropotkin
still
had
considerable
virgin
forest
an
smoking
a
pipe
sat
on
the
cottage
s
front
step
he
nodded
politely
ronny
stopped
he
might
as
well
try
to
get
a
little
of
the
feel
of
the
place
he
said
courteously
a
pleasant
the
nodded
as
evenings
should
be
after
a
fruitful
day
s
toil
sit
down
comrade
you
must
be
from
the
united
planets
have
you
ever
seen
earth
ronny
accepted
the
invitation
and
felt
a
soothing
calm
descend
upon
him
almost
immediately
an
almost
disturbingly
pleasant
calm
he
said
i
was
born
on
ai
the
old
man
said
tell
me
the
books
say
that
kropotkin
is
an
earth
type
planet
within
what
they
call
a
few
degrees
but
is
it
is
kropotkin
truly
like
the
mother
planet
ronny
looked
about
him
he
d
seen
some
of
this
world
as
the
shuttle
rocket
had
brought
them
down
from
the
passing
liner
the
forests
the
lakes
the
rivers
and
the
great
sections
untouched
by
man
s
hands
now
he
saw
the
areas
between
homes
the
neat
fields
the
signs
of
human
toil
of
hands
not
machines
no
he
said
shaking
his
head
i
m
afraid
not
this
is
how
earth
must
once
have
been
but
no
the
other
nodded
our
total
population
is
but
a
few
million
he
said
then
i
would
like
to
see
the
mother
planet
but
i
suppose
i
never
ronny
said
diplomatically
i
have
seen
little
of
kropotkin
thus
far
but
i
am
not
so
sure
but
that
i
might
not
be
happy
to
stay
here
rather
than
ever
return
to
the
old
man
knocked
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
by
striking
it
against
the
heel
of
a
hand
he
looked
about
him
thoughtfully
and
said
yes
perhaps
you
re
right
i
am
an
old
man
and
life
has
been
good
i
suppose
i
should
be
glad
that
i
ll
unlikely
live
to
see
kropotkin
change
you
plan
changes
the
old
man
looked
at
him
and
there
seemed
to
be
a
very
faint
bitterness
politely
suppressed
i
wouldn
t
say
planned
them
comrade
certainly
not
we
of
the
older
generation
but
the
trend
toward
change
is
already
to
be
seen
by
anyone
who
wishes
to
look
and
our
institutions
won
t
long
be
able
to
stand
but
of
course
if
you
re
from
united
planets
you
would
know
more
of
this
than
i
m
sorry
i
don
t
know
what
you
re
talking
you
are
new
indeed
on
kropotkin
the
old
man
said
just
a
he
went
into
his
house
and
emerged
with
a
small
power
pack
he
indicated
it
to
ronny
bronston
this
is
our
destruction
he
said
the
section
g
agent
shook
his
head
bewildered
the
sat
down
again
my
son
he
said
runs
the
farm
now
six
months
ago
he
traded
one
of
our
colts
for
a
small
pump
powered
by
one
of
these
it
was
little
use
on
my
part
to
argue
against
the
step
the
pump
eliminates
considerable
work
at
the
well
and
in
ronny
still
didn
t
understand
the
power
pack
is
dead
now
the
old
man
said
and
my
son
needs
a
new
they
re
extremely
cheap
ronny
said
an
industrialized
planet
turns
them
out
in
amounts
at
practically
no
we
have
little
with
which
to
trade
a
few
handicrafts
at
ronny
said
but
good
heavens
man
build
yourselves
a
plant
to
manufacture
power
packs
with
a
population
this
small
a
factory
employing
no
more
than
half
a
dozen
men
could
turn
out
all
you
the
old
man
was
shaking
his
head
he
held
up
the
battery
this
comes
from
the
planet
archimedes
he
said
one
of
the
most
highly
industrialized
in
the
up
so
i
understand
on
archimedes
do
you
know
how
many
persons
it
takes
to
manufacture
this
power
pack
illustration
a
handful
to
operate
the
whole
factory
archimedes
is
fully
the
old
man
was
still
moving
his
head
negatively
no
it
takes
the
total
working
population
of
the
planet
how
many
different
metals
do
you
think
are
contained
in
it
in
all
i
can
immediately
see
what
must
be
lead
and
ronny
said
uncomfortably
probably
at
least
a
dozen
some
in
microscopic
that
s
right
so
we
need
a
highly
developed
metallurgical
industry
before
we
can
even
begin
then
a
developed
transportation
industry
to
take
metals
to
the
factory
we
need
power
to
run
the
factory
solar
or
possibly
atomic
power
we
need
a
industry
to
equip
the
factory
the
transport
industry
and
the
power
industry
and
while
the
men
are
employed
in
these
we
need
farmers
to
produce
food
for
them
educators
to
teach
them
the
sciences
and
techniques
involved
and
an
entertainment
industry
to
amuse
them
in
their
hours
of
rest
as
their
lives
become
more
complicated
with
all
this
we
need
a
developed
medical
industry
to
keep
them
in
the
old
man
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
said
and
above
all
we
need
a
highly
complicated
government
to
keep
all
this
accumulation
of
wealth
in
check
and
balance
no
you
see
my
friend
it
takes
to
produce
products
such
as
this
and
thus
far
we
have
avoided
that
on
kropotkin
in
fact
it
was
for
such
avoidance
that
my
ancestors
originally
came
to
this
ronny
said
scowling
this
gets
ridiculous
you
show
me
this
basically
simple
power
pack
and
say
it
will
ruin
your
system
on
the
face
of
it
it
s
the
old
man
sighed
and
looked
out
over
the
village
unseeingly
it
s
not
just
that
single
item
of
course
the
other
day
one
of
my
neighbors
turned
up
with
a
light
bulb
with
power
for
a
year
s
time
it
is
the
envy
of
the
unthinking
persons
of
the
neighborhood
most
of
whom
would
give
a
great
deal
for
such
a
source
of
light
a
nephew
of
mine
has
somehow
even
acquired
a
powered
bicycle
i
think
you
call
them
from
somewhere
or
other
one
by
one
item
by
item
these
products
of
advanced
technology
turn
whence
we
don
t
seem
to
be
able
to
find
under
his
breath
ronny
muttered
i
beg
your
pardon
the
old
man
said
nothing
the
section
g
agent
said
he
leaned
forward
and
a
worried
frown
working
its
way
over
his
face
began
to
question
the
other
more
closely
afterwards
ronny
bronston
strode
slowly
toward
the
up
headquarters
there
was
only
a
small
contingent
of
united
planets
personnel
on
this
little
populated
member
planet
but
as
always
there
seemed
to
be
an
office
for
section
ronny
stood
outside
it
for
a
moment
there
were
voices
from
within
but
he
didn
t
knock
in
fact
he
cast
his
eyes
up
and
down
the
short
corridor
at
the
far
end
was
a
desk
with
a
girl
in
the
interplanetary
cultural
exchange
department
working
away
in
concentration
she
wasn
t
looking
in
his
direction
ronny
bronston
put
his
ear
to
the
door
the
building
was
primitive
enough
rustic
enough
in
its
construction
to
permit
his
hearing
tog
lee
chang
chu
was
saying
seriously
oh
it
was
chaotic
all
right
but
no
i
don
t
really
believe
it
could
have
been
a
tommy
paine
case
actually
i
d
suggest
to
you
that
you
run
over
to
catalina
when
i
was
on
avalon
i
heard
rumors
that
tommy
paine
s
finger
seemed
to
be
stirring
around
in
the
mess
there
yes
i
d
recommend
that
you
take
off
for
catalina
immediately
if
paine
is
anywhere
in
this
vicinity
at
all
it
would
be
for
a
moment
ronny
bronston
froze
then
in
automatic
reflex
his
hand
went
inside
his
jacket
to
rest
over
the
butt
of
the
model
h
automatic
there
no
that
wasn
t
the
answer
his
hand
dropped
away
from
the
gun
he
listened
further
another
voice
was
saying
we
thought
we
were
on
the
trail
for
a
while
on
hector
but
it
turned
out
it
wasn
t
paine
just
a
group
of
local
agitators
fed
up
with
the
communist
regime
there
there
s
going
to
be
a
blood
bath
on
hector
before
they
re
through
but
it
doesn
t
seem
to
be
paine
s
work
this
tog
s
voice
was
musing
well
you
never
know
it
sounds
like
the
sort
of
muck
he
likes
to
play
the
strange
voice
said
argumentatively
well
hector
a
few
fundamental
it
could
be
tog
said
but
that
s
their
internal
affairs
of
course
our
job
in
section
g
is
to
prevent
troubles
between
the
differing
and
religious
features
of
member
planets
whatever
we
think
of
some
of
the
things
paine
does
our
task
is
to
get
ronny
bronston
pushed
the
door
open
and
went
through
tog
lee
chang
chu
was
sitting
at
a
desk
nonchalant
and
petitely
beautiful
as
usual
comfortably
seated
in
were
two
young
men
by
their
attire
probably
citizens
of
united
planets
and
possibly
even
earthlings
hello
ronny
tog
said
softly
meet
frederic
lippman
and
pedro
nazaré
both
section
g
operatives
this
is
my
colleague
ronald
bronston
gentlemen
fredric
and
pedro
were
just
leaving
the
two
agents
got
up
to
shake
hands
ronny
said
you
can
t
be
in
that
much
of
a
hurry
what
s
your
assignment
boys
lippman
an
earnest
type
and
by
his
appearance
not
more
than
or
so
years
of
age
began
to
answer
but
nazaré
said
hurriedly
actually
it
s
a
confidential
assignment
we
re
working
directly
out
of
the
lippman
said
frowning
it
s
not
that
confidential
tog
bronston
s
an
agent
too
what
s
your
assignment
ronny
ronny
said
very
slowly
i
m
beginning
to
suspect
that
it
s
the
same
as
yours
and
various
pieces
are
beginning
to
fall
into
lippman
was
taken
aback
you
mean
you
re
looking
for
tommy
paine
his
eyes
went
to
his
associate
how
could
that
be
tog
i
didn
t
know
more
than
one
of
us
were
on
this
job
why
that
means
if
bronston
here
finds
him
first
i
won
t
get
my
permanent
ronny
looked
at
tog
lee
chang
chu
who
was
sitting
demurely
hands
in
lap
and
a
resigned
expression
on
her
face
he
said
nor
if
you
find
him
first
will
i
look
here
tog
how
many
men
does
sid
jakes
have
out
on
this
assignment
i
wouldn
t
know
she
said
mildly
he
snapped
a
few
dozen
or
so
or
possibly
a
few
hundred
it
seems
unlikely
there
could
be
that
many
she
said
mildly
she
looked
at
the
other
two
agents
i
think
you
two
had
better
run
along
take
my
suggestion
i
made
wait
a
minute
ronny
snapped
you
mean
that
they
go
to
catalina
that
s
tog
lee
chang
chu
looked
at
pedro
nazaré
and
he
turned
and
started
for
the
door
followed
by
fredric
lippman
who
was
still
scowling
his
puzzlement
wait
a
minute
ronny
snapped
i
tell
you
it
s
ridiculous
and
why
follow
her
suggestions
she
s
just
my
pedro
nazaré
said
come
on
fred
let
s
get
going
we
ll
have
to
but
lippman
wasn
t
having
any
his
assistant
he
said
to
tog
lee
chang
chu
tog
lee
chang
chu
s
face
changed
expression
in
sudden
decision
she
opened
her
bag
and
brought
forth
a
section
g
identification
wallet
and
flicked
it
open
the
badge
was
gold
i
suggest
you
hurry
she
said
to
the
two
agents
they
left
and
tog
turned
back
to
ronny
her
eyebrows
raised
questioningly
ronny
sank
down
into
one
of
the
chairs
recently
occupied
by
the
other
two
agents
and
tried
to
unravel
thoughts
he
said
finally
i
suppose
my
question
should
be
why
do
ross
metaxa
and
sid
jakes
send
an
agent
of
supervisor
rank
to
act
as
assistant
to
a
probationary
agent
but
that
s
not
what
i
m
asking
yet
first
lippman
just
called
his
buddy
tog
how
come
tog
took
her
seat
again
rueful
resignation
on
her
face
you
should
be
figuring
it
out
on
your
own
by
this
time
he
looked
at
her
belligerently
i
m
too
stupid
eh
the
anger
was
growing
within
him
tog
she
said
it
s
a
nickname
or
possibly
you
might
call
it
a
title
tog
the
other
guy
my
name
is
lee
chang
chu
and
i
m
of
supervisor
grade
presently
working
at
developing
new
section
g
operatives
considering
the
continuing
rapid
growth
of
up
and
the
continuing
crises
that
come
up
in
up
activities
developing
new
operatives
is
one
of
the
department
s
most
pressing
jobs
each
new
agent
on
his
first
assignment
is
always
paired
with
an
experienced
i
see
he
said
flatly
your
principal
job
being
to
needle
the
fledging
eh
she
lowered
her
eyes
i
wouldn
t
exactly
word
it
that
way
she
said
she
was
obviously
unrepentant
he
said
you
must
get
a
lot
of
laughs
out
of
it
if
i
say
it
seems
to
me
democracy
is
a
good
thing
you
give
me
an
argument
about
the
superiority
of
rule
by
an
elite
if
i
say
anarchism
is
ridiculous
you
dredge
up
an
opinion
that
it
s
man
s
highest
ethic
you
must
laugh
yourself
to
sleep
at
nights
you
and
metaxa
and
jakes
and
every
other
agent
in
section
everybody
is
in
on
the
tog
gag
but
the
sometimes
there
are
amusing
elements
to
the
work
lee
chang
conceded
demurely
just
one
more
thing
i
d
like
to
ask
ronny
rapped
this
first
assignment
agents
are
given
is
it
always
to
look
for
tommy
paine
she
looked
up
at
him
said
nothing
but
her
eyes
were
questioning
don
t
worry
he
snapped
i
ve
already
found
out
who
paine
ah
she
was
suddenly
interested
then
i
m
glad
i
ordered
that
other
probationary
agent
to
leave
evidently
he
hasn
t
obviously
i
didn
t
want
the
two
of
you
comparing
no
that
would
never
do
he
said
bitterly
well
this
is
the
end
of
the
assignment
so
far
as
you
and
i
are
concerned
i
m
heading
back
for
of
course
she
said
he
had
time
on
the
way
to
think
it
all
over
and
over
and
over
again
and
a
great
deal
of
it
simply
didn
t
make
sense
he
had
enough
information
to
be
disillusioned
sick
at
heart
to
have
crumbled
an
idealistic
edifice
that
had
taken
a
lifetime
to
build
a
lifetime
at
least
three
his
father
and
his
grandfather
before
him
had
had
the
dream
he
d
been
weaned
on
the
idealistic
purposes
of
the
united
planets
and
man
s
fated
growth
into
the
stars
he
was
a
dreamer
of
participating
in
the
glory
his
grandfather
had
been
a
citizen
of
earth
and
gave
up
a
commercial
position
to
take
a
job
that
amounted
to
little
more
than
a
janitor
in
an
obscure
department
of
interplanetary
financial
clearing
he
wanted
to
get
into
the
big
job
into
space
but
never
made
it
ronny
s
father
managed
to
work
up
to
the
point
where
he
was
a
supervisor
in
interplanetary
medical
exchange
in
the
tabulating
department
he
too
had
wanted
into
space
and
never
made
it
ronny
had
loved
them
both
in
a
way
fulfilling
his
own
dreams
had
been
a
debt
he
owed
them
because
at
the
same
time
he
was
fulfilling
theirs
and
now
this
all
that
had
been
gold
was
suddenly
gilted
lead
the
dream
had
become
contemptuous
nightmare
finally
back
in
greater
washington
he
went
immediately
from
the
shuttleport
to
the
octagon
his
bureau
of
investigation
badge
was
enough
to
see
him
through
the
and
all
the
way
through
to
the
office
of
irene
kasansky
she
looked
up
at
him
quickly
hi
she
said
ronny
bronston
isn
t
it
that
s
right
i
want
to
see
commissioner
she
scowled
i
can
t
work
you
in
now
how
about
sid
jakes
he
said
jakes
is
in
charge
of
the
tommy
paine
routine
isn
t
he
she
shot
a
sharper
look
up
at
him
that
s
right
she
said
warily
all
right
ronny
said
i
ll
see
her
deft
right
hand
slipped
open
a
drawer
in
her
desk
you
d
better
leave
your
gun
here
she
said
i
ve
known
probationary
agents
to
get
excited
in
my
he
looked
at
her
and
she
looked
back
her
gaze
level
ronny
bronston
shrugged
slipped
the
model
h
from
under
his
armpit
and
tossed
it
into
the
drawer
irene
kasansky
went
back
to
her
work
you
know
the
way
she
said
this
time
ronny
bronston
pushed
open
the
door
to
sid
jakes
office
without
knocking
the
section
g
supervisor
was
poring
over
reports
on
his
desk
he
looked
up
and
grinned
his
sid
jakes
grin
ronny
he
said
welcome
back
you
know
you
re
one
of
the
quickest
men
ever
to
return
from
a
tommy
paine
assignment
i
was
talking
to
lee
chang
only
a
day
or
so
ago
she
said
you
were
on
your
ronny
grunted
his
anger
growing
within
him
he
lowered
himself
into
one
of
the
room
s
heavy
chairs
and
glared
at
the
other
sid
jakes
chuckled
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
before
we
go
any
further
just
to
check
who
is
tommy
paine
ronny
snapped
you
the
supervisor
s
eyebrows
went
up
ronny
said
you
and
ross
metaxa
and
lee
chang
all
the
rest
of
section
section
g
is
tommy
good
man
sid
jakes
chortled
he
flicked
a
switch
on
his
order
box
irene
he
said
how
about
clearing
me
through
to
the
commissioner
i
want
to
take
ronny
in
for
his
irene
snapped
back
something
and
sid
jakes
switched
off
and
turned
to
ronny
happily
let
s
go
he
said
ross
is
free
for
a
ronny
bronston
said
nothing
he
followed
the
other
the
rage
within
him
was
still
mounting
in
the
months
that
had
elapsed
since
ronny
bronston
had
seen
ross
metaxa
the
latter
had
changed
not
at
all
his
clothing
was
still
sloppy
his
eyes
bleary
with
lack
of
sleep
or
abundance
of
both
his
expression
was
still
sour
and
skeptical
he
looked
up
at
their
entry
and
scowled
and
made
no
effort
to
rise
and
shake
hands
he
said
to
ronny
sourly
sound
off
and
get
it
over
with
i
haven
t
too
much
time
this
ronny
bronston
was
just
beginning
to
feel
tentacles
of
cold
doubt
but
he
suppressed
them
the
boiling
anger
was
uppermost
he
said
flatly
all
my
life
i
ve
been
a
dedicated
united
planets
man
all
my
life
i
ve
considered
its
efforts
the
most
praiseworthy
and
greatest
endeavor
man
has
ever
of
course
old
chap
jakes
told
him
cheerfully
we
know
all
that
or
you
wouldn
t
ever
have
been
chosen
as
an
agent
for
section
ronny
looked
at
him
in
disgust
i
ve
resigned
that
position
jakes
grinned
back
at
him
to
the
contrary
you
re
now
in
the
process
of
receiving
permanent
ronny
snorted
his
disgust
and
turned
back
to
metaxa
section
g
is
a
secret
department
of
the
bureau
of
investigation
devoted
to
subverting
article
one
of
the
united
planets
metaxa
nodded
you
don
t
deny
it
metaxa
shook
his
head
article
one
ronny
snapped
is
the
basic
foundation
of
the
charter
which
every
member
of
up
and
particularly
every
citizen
of
united
planets
such
as
ourselves
has
sworn
to
uphold
but
the
very
reason
for
the
existence
of
this
section
g
is
to
interfere
with
the
internal
affairs
of
member
planets
to
subvert
their
governments
their
economic
systems
their
religions
their
ideals
their
very
way
of
metaxa
yawned
and
reached
into
a
desk
drawer
for
his
bottle
that
s
right
he
said
anybody
like
a
drink
ronny
ignored
him
i
m
surprised
i
didn
t
catch
on
even
sooner
he
said
on
new
delos
mouley
hassan
the
local
agent
knew
the
was
going
to
be
assassinated
he
brought
in
extra
agents
and
even
a
detail
of
space
forces
guards
for
the
emergency
he
probably
engineered
the
assassination
nope
jakes
said
we
seldom
go
far
local
rebels
did
the
actual
work
but
admittedly
we
knew
what
they
were
planning
in
fact
i
ve
got
a
sneaking
suspicion
that
mouley
hassan
provided
them
with
the
bomb
that
lad
s
a
bit
too
but
ronny
blurted
that
s
deliberately
interfering
with
internal
affairs
if
the
word
got
out
every
planet
in
up
would
probably
no
planet
in
the
system
that
needed
a
change
so
badly
metaxa
growled
if
they
were
ever
going
to
swing
into
real
progress
that
hierarchy
of
priests
had
to
he
snorted
an
immortal
ronny
pressed
on
that
was
bad
enough
but
how
about
this
planet
mother
where
the
colonists
had
attempted
to
return
to
nature
and
live
in
the
manner
man
did
in
earliest
most
backward
planet
in
the
up
metaxa
said
sourly
they
just
had
to
be
and
kropotkin
ronny
blurted
don
t
you
understand
those
people
were
there
their
lives
were
simple
uncomplicated
and
they
had
achieved
a
happiness
metaxa
came
to
his
feet
he
scowled
at
ronny
bronston
and
growled
unfortunately
the
human
race
can
t
take
the
time
out
for
happiness
come
along
i
want
to
show
you
he
swung
around
the
corner
of
his
desk
and
made
his
way
toward
a
bookcase
ronny
stared
after
him
taken
off
guard
but
sid
jakes
was
grinning
his
amusement
ross
metaxa
pushed
a
concealed
button
and
the
bookcase
slid
away
to
one
side
to
reveal
an
elevator
beyond
come
along
metaxa
repeated
over
his
shoulder
he
entered
the
elevator
followed
by
jakes
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
ronny
bronston
followed
them
his
face
still
flushed
with
the
angered
argument
the
elevator
dropped
how
far
ronny
had
no
idea
it
stopped
and
they
emerged
into
a
plain
sparsely
furnished
vault
against
one
wall
was
a
boxlike
affair
that
reminded
ronny
of
nothing
so
much
as
a
for
all
practical
purposes
that
s
what
it
was
ross
metaxa
led
him
over
and
they
stared
down
into
its
interior
ronny
s
eyes
bugged
the
box
contained
the
partly
charred
body
of
an
animal
approximately
the
size
of
a
rabbit
no
not
an
animal
it
had
obviously
once
been
clothed
and
its
limbs
were
obviously
those
of
a
tool
using
life
form
metaxa
and
jakes
were
staring
down
at
it
solemnly
for
once
no
inane
grin
on
the
supervisor
s
face
and
that
of
ross
metaxa
was
more
weary
than
ever
ronny
said
finally
what
is
it
but
he
knew
you
tell
us
metaxa
growled
sourly
it
s
an
intelligent
life
form
ronny
blurted
why
has
it
been
kept
secret
let
s
go
on
back
upstairs
metaxa
sighed
back
in
his
office
he
said
now
i
go
into
my
speech
shut
up
for
a
he
poured
himself
a
drink
not
offering
one
to
the
other
two
ronny
he
said
man
isn
t
alone
in
the
galaxy
there
s
other
intelligent
life
dangerously
in
spite
of
himself
ronny
reacted
in
amusement
that
little
creature
down
there
the
size
of
a
small
monkey
as
soon
as
he
said
it
he
realized
the
ridiculousness
of
his
statement
metaxa
grunted
obviously
size
means
nothing
that
little
fellow
down
there
was
picked
up
by
one
of
our
space
forces
scouts
over
a
century
ago
how
long
he
d
been
drifting
through
space
we
don
t
know
possibly
only
months
but
possibly
hundreds
of
centuries
but
however
long
he
s
proof
that
man
is
not
alone
in
the
galaxy
and
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
when
the
expanding
human
race
will
come
up
against
this
other
whoever
it
was
illustration
but
ronny
protested
you
re
assuming
they
re
aggressive
perhaps
coming
in
contact
with
these
aliens
will
be
the
best
thing
that
ever
happened
to
man
possibly
that
little
fellow
down
there
is
the
most
benevolent
creature
ever
metaxa
looked
at
him
strangely
let
s
hope
so
he
said
however
when
found
he
was
in
what
must
have
been
a
scout
he
was
dead
and
his
craft
was
blasted
and
from
some
sort
of
weapons
fire
his
scout
was
obviously
a
military
craft
highly
equipped
with
what
could
only
be
weapons
most
of
them
so
damaged
our
engineers
haven
t
been
able
to
figure
them
out
to
the
extent
they
have
been
able
to
reconstruct
them
they
re
scared
silly
no
there
s
no
two
ways
about
it
our
little
rabbit
sized
intelligence
down
in
the
vault
was
killed
in
an
interplanetary
conflict
and
sooner
or
later
ronny
man
in
his
explosion
into
the
stars
is
going
to
run
into
either
or
both
of
the
opponents
in
that
ronny
bronston
slumped
back
into
his
chair
his
brain
running
out
a
dozen
leads
at
once
metaxa
and
jakes
remained
quiet
looking
at
him
speculatively
ronny
said
slowly
then
the
purpose
of
section
g
is
to
push
the
member
planets
of
up
along
the
fastest
path
of
progress
to
get
them
ready
for
the
eventual
inevitable
not
just
section
g
metaxa
growled
but
all
of
the
united
planets
organization
although
most
of
the
rank
and
file
don
t
even
know
our
basic
purpose
section
g
we
do
the
dirty
work
and
are
proud
to
do
it
by
every
method
we
can
ronny
leaned
forward
but
look
he
said
why
not
simply
inform
all
member
planets
of
this
common
danger
they
d
all
unite
in
the
effort
to
meet
the
common
potential
foe
anything
standing
in
the
way
would
be
brushed
metaxa
shook
his
head
wearily
would
they
is
a
common
danger
enough
for
man
to
change
his
institutions
particularly
those
pertaining
to
property
power
and
religion
history
doesn
t
show
it
delve
back
into
early
times
and
you
ll
recall
for
an
example
that
in
man
s
early
discovery
of
nuclear
weapons
he
almost
destroyed
himself
three
or
four
different
systems
at
that
time
and
all
would
have
preferred
destruction
rather
than
changes
in
their
social
jakes
said
in
an
unwonted
quiet
tone
no
until
someone
comes
up
with
a
better
answer
it
looks
as
though
section
g
is
going
to
have
to
continue
the
job
of
advancing
man
s
institutions
in
spite
of
the
commissioner
made
it
clearer
it
s
not
as
though
we
deal
with
all
our
member
planets
it
isn
t
necessary
but
you
see
ronny
the
best
colonists
are
usually
made
up
of
the
well
crackpot
element
those
who
are
satisfied
stay
at
home
america
for
instance
was
settled
by
the
adventurers
the
malcontents
the
the
religious
cultists
and
even
fugitives
and
criminals
of
europe
so
it
is
in
the
stars
a
group
of
colonists
go
out
with
their
dreams
their
schemes
their
ideas
in
a
few
centuries
they
ve
populated
their
new
planet
and
often
do
very
well
indeed
but
often
not
and
a
nudge
a
push
from
section
g
can
start
them
up
another
rung
or
so
of
the
ladder
of
social
evolution
most
of
them
don
t
want
the
push
few
cultures
if
any
realize
they
are
mortal
like
hitler
s
reich
they
expect
to
last
at
least
a
thousand
years
they
resist
any
change
for
the
ronny
s
defenses
were
crumbling
but
he
threw
one
last
punch
how
do
you
know
the
changes
you
make
are
for
the
better
metaxa
shrugged
heavy
shoulders
it
s
sometimes
difficult
to
decide
but
we
aim
for
changes
that
will
mean
an
increased
scientific
progress
a
more
advanced
industrial
technology
more
and
better
education
the
opening
of
opportunity
for
every
member
of
the
culture
to
exert
himself
to
the
full
of
his
abilities
the
last
is
particularly
important
too
many
cultures
even
those
that
think
of
themselves
as
particularly
advanced
suppress
the
individual
by
one
means
or
ronny
was
still
mentally
reeling
with
the
magnitude
of
it
all
but
how
can
you
account
for
the
fact
that
these
alien
intelligences
haven
t
already
come
in
contact
with
us
metaxa
shrugged
again
the
solar
system
our
sun
is
way
out
in
a
sparsely
populated
spiral
arm
of
our
galaxy
undoubtedly
these
others
are
further
in
toward
the
center
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
how
far
away
they
are
or
how
many
sun
systems
they
dominate
or
even
how
many
other
empires
of
intelligent
life
forms
there
are
all
we
know
is
that
there
are
other
intelligences
in
the
galaxy
that
they
are
near
enough
like
us
to
live
on
the
same
type
planets
the
more
opportunity
man
has
to
develop
before
the
initial
contact
takes
place
the
stronger
bargaining
position
or
military
position
as
the
case
may
be
he
ll
be
sid
jakes
summed
up
the
tommy
paine
business
for
ronny
s
sake
we
need
capable
agents
badly
but
we
need
dedicated
and
efficient
ones
we
can
t
afford
anything
less
so
when
we
come
upon
potential
section
g
operatives
we
send
them
out
with
a
trusted
tog
to
get
a
picture
of
these
united
planets
of
ours
it
s
the
quickest
method
of
indoctrination
we
ve
hit
upon
the
agent
literally
teaches
himself
by
observation
and
participation
usually
it
takes
four
or
five
stops
on
this
planet
and
that
before
the
probationary
agent
begins
sympathizing
with
the
efforts
of
this
elusive
tommy
paine
especially
since
every
section
g
agent
he
runs
into
including
the
tog
of
course
fills
him
full
of
stories
of
tommy
paine
s
activities
you
were
one
of
the
quickest
to
stumble
on
the
true
nature
of
our
section
after
calling
at
only
three
planets
you
saw
that
we
ourselves
are
tommy
but
but
what
s
the
end
ronny
said
plaintively
you
say
our
job
is
advancing
man
even
in
spite
of
himself
when
it
comes
to
that
we
start
at
the
bottom
of
the
evolutionary
ladder
in
a
condition
of
savagery
clan
communism
in
government
simple
animism
in
religion
and
slowly
we
progress
through
barbarism
to
civilization
through
paganism
to
the
higher
ethical
codes
through
chattel
slavery
and
then
feudalism
and
beyond
what
is
the
final
end
the
ultima
thule
metaxa
was
shaking
his
head
again
he
poured
himself
another
drink
offered
the
bottle
this
time
to
the
others
we
don
t
know
he
said
wearily
perhaps
there
is
none
perhaps
there
is
always
another
rung
on
this
evolutionary
he
punched
at
his
order
box
and
said
irene
have
them
do
up
a
silver
badge
for
ronny
bronston
took
a
deep
breath
and
reached
for
the
brown
bottle
well
he
said
i
suppose
i
m
ready
to
ask
for
my
first
he
thought
for
a
moment
by
the
way
if
there
s
any
way
to
swing
it
i
wouldn
t
mind
working
with
supervisor
lee
chang
