mr
keeling
had
expected
an
edifying
when
dr
inglis
gave
out
as
his
text
there
shall
be
wailing
and
gnashing
of
teeth
and
as
the
discourse
proceeded
he
felt
that
his
anticipations
were
amply
justified
based
on
this
unshakable
foundation
and
buttressed
by
other
stalwart
pronouncements
the
doctrine
of
eternal
damnation
wore
a
very
safe
and
solid
aspect
it
was
the
justice
of
it
that
appealed
to
mr
keeling
mankind
had
been
warned
in
a
perfectly
unmistakable
manner
that
if
they
persisted
in
certain
courses
of
action
and
in
certain
inabilities
to
believe
they
would
be
punished
for
ever
and
ever
that
was
fair
that
was
reasonable
rules
were
made
to
be
obeyed
if
you
were
truly
sorry
for
having
disobeyed
them
a
secondary
principle
called
mercy
came
to
the
succour
of
the
repentant
but
dr
inglis
did
not
say
so
much
about
that
he
was
concerned
with
the
inflexibility
of
his
text
it
is
said
that
a
man
s
conduct
is
coloured
and
inspired
by
his
religion
but
it
is
equally
true
to
say
of
another
and
more
numerous
class
that
their
religion
is
coloured
and
inspired
by
their
conduct
certainly
that
was
the
case
with
mr
keeling
his
life
did
not
so
much
spring
out
of
his
religion
as
his
religion
out
of
his
life
and
what
he
felt
every
sunday
morning
and
evening
in
church
was
the
fruit
the
stern
honey
distilled
so
to
speak
from
the
mental
and
moral
integrity
which
had
pervaded
him
from
monday
till
saturday
inclusive
all
the
week
the
bees
collected
that
store
of
provender
which
was
transmuted
into
the
frame
of
mind
which
was
equivalent
in
him
to
religion
it
did
not
in
the
smallest
degree
enter
into
his
life
his
life
secreted
it
and
he
found
it
very
well
expressed
for
him
in
the
sermon
of
dr
inglis
and
the
fiercer
of
king
david
s
psalms
the
uprightness
honesty
and
industry
which
he
demanded
from
himself
he
demanded
also
from
others
but
it
was
not
his
religion
that
inspired
those
excellent
qualities
they
inspired
it
mr
keeling
sat
at
one
end
of
the
varnished
pew
with
his
children
in
a
row
between
him
and
their
mother
at
the
other
end
there
were
large
schedules
of
commandments
on
either
side
of
the
plain
bare
table
miscalled
an
altar
so
that
everybody
could
see
what
was
expected
of
him
while
dr
inglis
told
them
what
they
could
expect
if
they
were
not
very
careful
next
his
father
sat
john
who
from
the
unfortunate
accident
of
his
being
the
youngest
went
last
into
the
pew
while
mr
keeling
stood
like
an
angry
shepherd
in
the
aisle
to
herd
his
family
into
the
fold
just
above
which
rose
the
pulpit
where
dr
inglis
at
this
moment
was
speaking
in
a
voice
of
icy
conviction
john
s
position
was
thus
a
peculiarly
depressing
one
for
his
natural
instinct
in
those
hours
of
tedium
in
church
was
to
edge
away
as
far
as
possible
from
his
father
but
on
the
other
side
of
him
was
his
sister
alice
who
not
only
sang
psalms
and
canticles
and
hymns
with
such
piercing
resonance
that
john
s
left
ear
sang
and
buzzed
during
the
prayers
afterwards
but
had
marvellously
angular
knees
and
elbows
which
with
a
pious
and
unconscious
air
she
pressed
into
john
s
slim
side
if
he
encroached
on
her
due
share
of
the
pew
and
when
we
consider
that
john
was
just
seventeen
years
old
an
age
when
the
young
male
animal
has
a
tendency
to
show
symptoms
of
its
growth
and
vigour
by
jerky
electric
movements
known
as
fidgets
whenever
it
has
to
stop
in
one
position
for
more
than
a
minute
or
two
it
was
reasonable
that
john
should
conclude
that
his
share
of
weeping
and
gnashing
of
teeth
had
begun
already
but
church
time
did
not
last
for
ever
and
ever
beyond
the
angular
alice
who
was
came
hugh
whose
banns
had
been
given
out
that
day
for
the
first
time
just
before
the
sermon
and
who
was
still
feeling
rather
hot
and
uncomfortable
about
it
he
had
hinted
at
breakfast
that
perhaps
he
would
not
go
to
church
that
morning
in
consequence
but
his
father
had
fixed
him
with
so
appalling
a
countenance
that
the
hint
developed
no
further
alice
s
banns
had
never
been
given
out
by
anybody
and
a
physiognomist
might
hazard
the
conjecture
that
they
never
would
be
for
she
had
in
her
face
with
its
eyes
high
cheekbones
and
mouth
that
looked
as
if
it
had
got
unbuttoned
that
indescribable
air
of
which
fate
sometimes
imprints
on
the
features
of
girls
still
scarcely
of
marriageable
age
they
do
not
as
alice
did
not
seem
to
be
of
the
types
from
which
wives
and
mothers
are
developed
a
celibacy
tortured
it
may
be
seems
the
fate
inexplicably
destined
for
them
by
the
irony
of
nature
who
decreed
that
they
should
be
women
and
they
discharge
their
hearts
in
peevishness
or
in
feverish
activities
alice
was
inclined
to
the
more
amiable
of
these
but
she
could
be
peevish
too
at
the
end
of
the
row
large
inane
and
comfortable
came
mrs
keeling
listening
without
appreciation
dissent
or
emotion
of
any
kind
to
this
uncompromising
view
of
the
future
of
miserable
sinners
for
that
was
not
the
sort
of
thing
that
affected
her
in
the
slightest
degree
since
it
concerned
not
this
world
but
the
next
though
she
quite
believed
in
the
next
world
she
did
not
take
the
smallest
interest
in
it
she
regarded
it
just
about
as
the
ordinary
citizen
of
a
country
town
regards
australia
very
likely
dr
inglis
was
right
about
it
and
we
should
all
know
in
time
she
had
pale
eyebrows
rather
prominent
gray
eyes
and
hair
from
which
the
original
yellow
was
fast
fading
her
general
appearance
was
of
a
woman
who
thirty
years
ago
had
probably
been
exceedingly
pretty
in
an
absolutely
meaningless
manner
this
indeed
had
been
the
case
as
certain
photographs
fast
fading
too
scattered
about
her
boudoir
sufficiently
proved
it
was
reasonable
to
suppose
that
her
marriage
with
so
obviously
dominant
a
man
as
thomas
keeling
should
have
sucked
all
colour
mental
and
physical
out
of
her
but
in
the
process
she
had
developed
a
certain
protective
strength
of
her
own
an
inertia
of
dead
weight
she
did
not
make
up
her
mind
on
many
topics
but
when
she
did
she
sank
deeply
down
like
a
stone
and
a
great
deal
of
grappling
and
effort
was
required
to
move
her
she
did
not
argue
she
did
not
struggle
she
just
remained
her
power
of
remaining
indeed
was
so
remarkable
that
it
was
possible
that
there
might
be
something
alive
some
power
of
suction
that
gave
her
force
on
the
other
hand
it
was
possible
that
this
sticking
was
mere
brute
weight
undirected
by
any
human
will
she
stopped
where
she
was
obeying
habits
of
heavy
bodies
and
it
required
a
great
deal
of
strength
to
shift
her
even
her
husband
that
notable
remover
of
all
obstacles
that
stood
in
his
way
seldom
attempted
to
do
so
when
he
was
convinced
she
meant
to
abide
in
the
course
of
years
he
had
tugged
her
or
perhaps
she
had
really
gone
of
her
own
accord
to
the
sort
of
place
where
he
wished
her
to
be
somewhere
between
an
in
the
awful
which
she
had
lately
furnished
and
the
kitchen
in
other
words
she
gave
him
an
extremely
comfortable
home
and
took
her
place
there
as
hostess
but
if
he
wanted
more
than
that
she
was
as
he
had
found
out
a
millstone
round
his
neck
in
common
with
many
women
of
her
type
she
had
a
practically
inexhaustible
flow
of
words
to
her
mouth
which
seemed
a
disintegration
rather
than
an
expression
of
the
fabric
of
her
faculties
but
every
now
and
then
among
this
debris
there
occurred
an
idea
disconnected
from
all
else
and
floating
down
on
its
own
account
which
seemed
to
suggest
that
emmeline
had
a
mind
after
all
though
you
would
never
have
thought
it
but
an
idea
did
appear
now
and
again
a
bright
solid
sensible
idea
lying
there
like
a
jewel
in
a
gutter
she
had
tastes
too
a
marked
liking
for
sweet
things
for
quantities
of
cream
in
her
tea
for
bright
colours
for
what
we
may
call
mendelssohnic
music
and
for
decorations
she
had
a
good
deal
of
geniality
which
so
to
speak
led
nowhere
and
a
complete
absence
of
physical
cowardice
which
might
be
due
to
a
want
of
imagination
apart
from
the
strenuous
matter
of
dr
inglis
s
discourse
a
circumstance
that
added
interest
to
it
was
the
fact
that
this
was
the
last
sunday
on
which
he
would
officiate
at
st
thomas
s
bracebridge
and
he
had
already
been
the
recipient
of
a
silver
deeply
chased
with
scrolls
and
vegetables
subscribed
for
by
his
parishioners
and
bought
at
mr
keeling
s
stores
and
a
framed
address
in
primary
colours
he
had
been
appointed
to
a
canonry
of
the
cathedral
that
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
hollow
on
the
sides
of
which
bracebridge
so
picturesquely
clustered
and
his
successor
a
youngish
man
with
a
short
pale
beard
now
curiously
coloured
with
the
light
that
came
through
a
stained
glass
window
opposite
had
read
the
lessons
and
the
litany
mr
silverdale
indeed
in
spite
of
the
special
interest
of
dr
inglis
s
discourse
was
engrossing
a
good
deal
of
alice
keeling
s
attention
and
her
imagination
was
very
busy
he
had
spent
an
assiduous
week
in
calling
on
his
parishioners
but
she
had
not
been
at
home
when
he
paid
his
visit
to
her
mother
who
had
formed
no
ideas
about
him
and
alice
was
now
looking
forward
with
a
good
deal
of
excitement
to
when
he
was
going
to
take
supper
with
them
after
evening
service
as
her
mother
had
expressed
it
in
her
note
or
after
evensong
as
he
had
expressed
it
in
his
answer
his
conduct
and
appearance
during
the
service
had
aroused
her
interest
for
he
wore
a
richly
coloured
stole
and
a
very
short
surplice
had
bowed
in
the
direction
of
the
east
window
as
he
walked
up
the
chancel
and
had
made
a
very
deep
obeisance
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
the
creed
when
everybody
else
stood
upright
somehow
there
was
a
different
atmosphere
about
him
from
that
which
surrounded
the
grim
and
austere
dr
inglis
something
in
the
pale
face
and
in
a
rapt
expression
which
she
easily
read
into
his
eyes
that
made
her
mentally
call
him
rather
than
like
most
young
women
in
whom
the
destiny
of
is
unrolling
itself
alice
had
a
strong
potentiality
for
furtive
romance
and
while
the
pains
of
hell
were
being
enunciated
to
her
inattentive
ears
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
mr
silverdale
and
she
began
to
think
of
lord
tennyson
s
poem
of
galahad
who
was
unmarried
too
she
was
so
far
lost
in
this
that
the
rustle
of
the
uprising
congregation
at
the
end
of
the
sermon
reached
her
belatedly
and
she
rose
in
a
considerable
hurry
filling
up
the
gap
in
this
tall
barrier
of
keelings
she
and
her
mother
were
not
less
than
five
feet
ten
in
height
john
s
inches
had
already
outsoared
them
both
while
her
father
and
hugh
each
a
full
six
feet
of
solid
stuff
completed
the
substantial
row
by
one
of
nature
s
unkindest
plans
the
sons
were
handsome
the
daughter
plain
but
all
had
the
quality
of
size
about
them
a
hymn
followed
while
the
offertory
which
mr
keeling
helped
to
collect
in
open
mahogany
plates
was
in
progress
and
the
blessing
pronounced
by
mr
silverdale
who
made
an
odd
movement
in
the
air
with
his
right
hand
brought
the
service
to
a
close
according
to
custom
mr
keeling
with
his
two
sons
went
for
a
brisk
walk
whatever
the
weather
before
lunch
while
alice
and
her
mother
one
of
whose
habits
was
to
set
as
few
feet
to
the
ground
as
was
humanly
possible
without
incurring
the
danger
of
striking
root
got
into
the
victoria
that
waited
for
them
at
the
on
which
the
fat
horse
was
roused
from
his
reverie
and
began
heavily
lolloping
homewards
it
was
not
usual
in
bracebridge
to
have
a
carriage
out
on
sunday
and
mrs
keeling
surveying
less
fortunate
pedestrians
through
her
glass
was
sunday
by
sunday
a
little
lucretian
on
the
subject
the
matter
of
the
carriage
also
was
a
monument
to
her
own
immovableness
for
her
husband
years
ago
had
done
his
utmost
to
induce
her
to
traverse
the
half
mile
on
her
own
feet
ah
there
is
poor
mrs
etheridge
she
said
she
will
get
very
hot
and
dusty
before
she
reaches
home
i
would
offer
her
a
lift
but
it
would
make
such
a
crush
for
us
all
and
there
is
poor
mr
moulton
how
he
limps
i
noticed
that
when
he
was
handing
the
other
offertory
plate
he
has
a
long
walk
before
him
too
has
he
not
but
we
can
not
drive
everybody
home
it
is
pleasant
driving
the
thin
rug
keeps
off
the
dust
and
i
want
no
other
covering
it
is
neither
too
hot
nor
too
cold
just
what
i
like
but
it
looks
threatening
over
there
i
should
not
wonder
if
poor
mrs
etheridge
got
a
drenching
before
she
reaches
her
little
house
her
house
is
damp
too
i
have
often
noticed
that
and
to
get
hot
and
wet
and
sit
in
a
damp
house
is
the
very
way
to
get
pneumonia
you
are
very
silent
alice
assumed
a
slightly
nippy
look
i
was
waiting
till
you
had
finished
mamma
she
permitted
herself
to
observe
here
mrs
keeling
s
disintegration
of
mind
showed
itself
she
had
but
a
moment
before
been
critical
of
alice
s
silence
yes
dear
that
is
what
i
always
tried
to
teach
you
she
said
when
you
were
children
just
as
my
mother
taught
me
i
m
sure
i
told
you
all
every
day
not
to
talk
with
your
mouths
full
or
when
anybody
else
is
talking
if
we
all
talked
together
there
would
be
a
fine
noise
to
be
sure
and
nobody
a
bit
the
wiser
i
took
a
great
deal
of
trouble
about
your
manners
and
i
m
sure
it
was
not
thrown
away
for
i
consider
you
ve
all
got
very
good
manners
even
john
when
he
chooses
talking
of
that
this
phrase
meant
nothing
in
mrs
keeling
s
mouth
i
noticed
mr
silverdale
in
church
he
seemed
to
me
to
have
a
hungry
kind
of
look
i
dare
say
his
housekeeper
is
very
careless
about
his
meals
not
having
a
wife
i
hope
he
will
make
a
good
meal
this
evening
perhaps
it
would
be
safer
dear
if
you
refused
the
salmon
mayonnaise
as
you
are
not
so
very
fond
of
it
mrs
bellaway
would
have
it
that
there
was
plenty
but
she
has
such
a
small
appetite
i
saw
nothing
hungry
about
his
face
said
alice
with
decision
he
looked
so
rapt
and
as
if
anything
like
food
was
the
last
subject
he
would
think
very
likely
my
dear
you
are
wonderful
at
reading
character
all
the
same
the
people
who
don
t
give
a
thought
to
food
are
just
those
who
do
go
hungry
so
we
may
both
of
us
be
right
is
that
a
spot
of
rain
or
a
fly
i
felt
something
on
the
back
of
my
alice
put
her
clasped
hands
between
her
knees
and
squeezed
them
she
was
perfectly
willing
to
go
without
her
mayonnaise
but
she
could
not
bear
her
mother
should
think
mr
silverdale
looked
hungry
i
thought
his
face
was
so
like
jonah
preaching
at
nineveh
in
the
stained
glass
window
she
said
mrs
keeling
suddenly
became
coherently
humorous
an
idea
not
much
of
one
but
still
an
idea
floated
down
the
debris
from
her
mind
well
he
had
had
nothing
to
eat
for
three
days
she
remarked
that
seems
to
show
that
i
m
the
street
down
which
they
drove
from
church
very
soon
ceased
to
be
a
street
in
the
sense
of
its
being
lined
on
each
side
by
contiguous
houses
and
became
alfred
road
and
was
bounded
on
each
side
by
brick
and
stucco
villas
at
first
stood
but
presently
they
took
on
an
air
of
greater
spaciousness
and
stood
square
and
singly
while
the
gardens
that
sandwiched
them
before
and
behind
were
large
enough
to
contain
a
and
six
or
seven
laurels
in
front
and
a
and
a
small
kitchen
garden
at
the
back
but
perhaps
they
scarcely
warranted
such
names
as
chatsworth
blenheim
balmoral
or
the
engadine
which
appeared
so
prominently
on
their
painted
gates
blenheim
had
once
been
mrs
keeling
s
home
and
her
mother
a
tiny
venomous
old
lady
in
a
lived
and
was
likely
long
to
live
there
still
for
she
had
admirable
health
and
the
keen
spiteful
temper
which
gives
its
possessor
so
indignant
and
absorbing
an
interest
in
life
it
was
to
a
far
narrower
home
than
blenheim
that
emmeline
had
gone
on
her
marriage
with
mr
keeling
and
though
the
greater
part
of
alfred
road
had
shaken
their
heads
over
her
mating
herself
with
a
man
so
much
below
her
socially
her
mother
wife
and
now
widow
of
a
retired
captain
had
formed
a
juster
estimate
of
her
future
s
chin
a
silly
pretty
girl
like
emmeline
she
thought
was
very
lucky
to
capture
a
man
who
was
going
to
make
his
way
upwards
so
obviously
as
that
strapping
young
fellow
with
the
square
jaw
he
was
then
but
the
proprietor
of
the
fishmonger
s
shop
at
the
end
of
the
high
street
but
mrs
goodford
knew
very
well
without
being
told
so
by
young
keeling
himself
that
he
was
not
of
the
sort
which
remain
a
small
fishmonger
events
had
justified
her
insight
and
it
was
to
a
much
bigger
house
than
mrs
goodford
s
that
her
daughter
was
being
driven
on
this
sunday
morning
as
the
victoria
pursued
its
leisurely
way
the
spaces
between
the
blenheims
and
chatsworths
grew
larger
the
villas
ceased
to
have
but
one
window
on
each
side
of
the
front
door
they
stood
farther
back
from
the
road
and
were
approached
by
small
carriage
drives
culminating
in
what
was
known
as
the
carriage
sweep
in
front
of
the
house
a
gravelled
space
where
a
carriage
could
turn
completely
round
two
gates
led
to
the
carriage
sweep
on
one
of
which
was
painted
in
and
on
the
other
out
and
the
spaces
surrounding
the
houses
could
justly
be
called
grounds
since
they
embraced
tennis
lawns
and
kitchen
gardens
with
glass
and
shrubberies
with
winding
paths
retired
colonels
must
needs
have
private
money
of
their
own
in
addition
to
their
pensions
to
live
so
spaciously
and
mr
keeling
even
thus
housed
was
putting
by
very
considerable
sums
of
money
every
year
into
one
of
those
carriage
drives
advertised
to
as
the
entrance
of
the
cedars
probably
because
there
were
three
prosperous
larch
trees
planted
near
the
in
gate
mrs
keeling
s
carriage
turned
and
after
passing
some
yards
of
shrubbery
stopped
before
a
wooden
gothic
porch
both
ladies
appeared
unconscious
of
having
reached
home
till
a
small
boy
covered
with
buttons
came
out
of
the
house
and
removed
the
light
that
covered
their
knees
it
was
but
a
few
months
ago
that
mr
keeling
taking
advantage
of
a
break
in
the
lease
of
his
own
house
and
the
undoubted
bargain
that
he
had
secured
in
this
more
spacious
residence
had
bought
the
freehold
of
the
cedars
and
had
given
the
furnishing
and
embellishment
of
it
naming
the
total
sum
not
to
be
exceeded
into
the
hands
of
his
wife
and
the
head
of
the
furnishing
department
in
his
stores
the
gothic
porch
already
there
had
suggested
a
scheme
to
the
artistic
mr
bowman
and
from
it
you
walked
into
a
large
square
hall
of
an
amazing
kind
on
the
floor
were
red
encaustic
tiles
with
blue
and
the
walls
and
ceiling
were
covered
with
the
most
expensive
and
paper
of
tudor
design
with
alternate
crowns
and
portcullises
it
was
clearly
inconvenient
that
visitors
should
be
able
to
look
in
through
the
window
that
opened
on
the
so
mr
bowman
had
arranged
that
it
should
not
open
at
all
but
be
filled
with
sham
impervious
to
the
eye
in
front
of
it
stood
a
large
table
to
hold
the
clothings
and
impedimenta
of
and
on
each
side
of
it
were
chairs
of
gothic
design
the
fireplace
also
new
had
modern
dutch
tiles
in
it
and
a
high
battlemented
with
turrets
at
the
corners
for
hats
there
was
a
mahogany
with
tipped
with
brass
instead
of
pegs
and
on
the
walls
were
trophies
of
spears
and
and
swords
mr
bowman
would
have
left
the
hall
thus
in
classic
severity
but
his
partner
in
decoration
here
intervened
and
insisted
on
its
being
made
more
to
secure
this
she
added
a
second
table
on
which
stood
a
small
stuffed
crocodile
rampant
holding
in
his
outstretched
forelegs
a
copper
tray
for
visitors
calling
cards
mrs
keeling
was
very
much
pleased
with
this
considering
it
so
quaint
and
when
her
friends
called
it
often
served
as
the
from
which
they
leaped
into
the
sea
of
conversation
the
grate
of
the
empty
of
fuel
in
this
midsummer
weather
was
filled
with
multitudinous
strips
of
polychromatic
paper
with
gilt
threads
among
it
which
streamed
from
some
fixed
point
up
in
the
chimney
and
suggested
that
a
lady
with
a
skirt
covered
with
ribbons
had
stuck
in
the
chimney
her
head
and
body
being
invisible
by
the
fireplace
mrs
keeling
had
placed
a
painted
wheelbarrow
with
a
gilt
spade
containing
fuchsias
in
pots
and
among
the
trophies
of
arms
had
inserted
various
polynesian
aprons
of
shells
and
leather
thongs
brought
back
by
her
father
from
his
voyages
these
the
outraged
mr
bowman
sarcastically
allowed
added
colour
about
which
there
was
no
doubt
whatever
beyond
this
hall
lay
a
farther
inner
one
out
of
which
ascended
the
main
staircase
furnished
here
again
could
be
traced
mr
bowman
s
chaste
finger
with
a
grandfather
s
clock
and
reproductions
of
jacobean
chairs
from
this
opened
a
big
giving
on
the
lawn
at
the
back
and
communicating
at
one
end
with
mrs
keeling
s
these
rooms
as
being
more
exclusively
feminine
were
inspired
in
the
matter
of
their
decoration
by
mrs
keeling
s
unaided
taste
about
them
nothing
need
be
said
beyond
the
fact
that
it
would
take
any
one
a
considerable
time
to
ascertain
whether
they
contained
a
greater
number
of
mirrors
framed
in
plush
and
painted
with
lilies
or
of
draped
pictures
standing
at
angles
on
easels
saddlebag
chairs
damask
curtains
landseer
prints
and
a
brussels
carpet
were
the
chief
characteristics
of
the
to
the
left
of
the
gothic
and
inner
halls
a
very
large
room
had
been
built
out
to
the
demolition
of
a
laurel
shrubbery
this
was
mr
keeling
s
study
and
when
he
gave
his
house
over
to
the
taste
of
his
decorators
he
made
the
stipulation
that
they
should
not
exercise
their
artistic
faculties
therein
but
leave
it
entirely
to
him
in
fact
there
had
been
a
short
and
violent
scene
of
ejection
when
the
crocodile
had
appeared
on
a
table
there
owing
to
the
inadvertence
of
a
for
mr
keeling
had
thrown
it
out
of
the
window
on
to
the
carriage
sweep
and
one
of
its
hind
legs
had
to
be
repaired
here
for
furniture
he
had
a
gray
drugget
on
the
floor
a
couple
of
easy
chairs
half
a
dozen
deal
ones
an
immense
table
and
a
while
the
wall
space
was
entirely
taken
up
with
book
shelves
these
were
but
as
yet
and
stacks
of
books
some
still
in
the
parcels
in
which
they
had
arrived
from
dealers
and
publishers
stood
on
the
floor
this
room
with
its
books
was
mr
keeling
s
secret
romance
all
his
life
even
from
the
days
of
the
the
collection
of
fine
illustrated
books
had
been
his
hobby
his
where
lay
his
escape
from
the
eternal
pursuit
of
and
from
the
tedium
of
domestic
life
there
he
indulged
his
undeveloped
love
of
the
romance
of
literature
and
the
untutored
joy
with
which
design
of
line
and
colour
inspired
him
as
an
apostle
of
thoroughness
in
business
and
everything
else
his
books
must
be
as
well
equipped
as
books
could
be
there
must
be
fine
bindings
the
best
paper
and
printing
and
above
all
there
must
be
pictures
when
that
was
done
you
might
say
you
had
got
a
book
for
rarity
and
antiquity
he
cared
nothing
at
all
a
sumptuous
edition
of
a
book
of
nursery
rhymes
was
more
desirable
in
his
eyes
than
any
caxton
here
in
his
hard
industrious
puritan
life
was
keeling
s
secret
garden
of
which
none
of
his
family
held
the
key
few
at
all
entered
the
room
and
into
the
spirit
of
it
none
except
perhaps
the
young
man
who
was
at
the
head
of
the
book
department
at
keeling
s
stores
he
had
often
been
of
use
to
the
proprietor
in
pointing
out
to
him
the
publication
of
some
new
edition
he
might
wish
to
possess
and
now
and
then
as
on
this
particular
sunday
afternoon
he
was
invited
to
spend
an
hour
at
the
house
looking
over
mr
keeling
s
latest
purchases
he
came
of
course
by
the
back
door
and
was
conducted
by
the
boy
in
buttons
along
the
servants
passage
for
mrs
keeling
would
certainly
not
like
to
have
the
front
door
opened
to
him
that
would
have
been
far
from
proper
and
he
might
have
put
his
hat
on
one
of
the
chamois
horns
but
there
was
no
real
danger
of
that
for
it
had
never
occurred
to
charles
propert
to
approach
the
cedars
by
any
but
the
tradesman
s
entrance
mrs
keeling
in
the
passionless
and
conduct
of
her
life
very
seldom
allowed
any
external
circumstance
to
annoy
her
and
when
she
found
on
her
arrival
home
this
morning
a
note
beside
the
crocodile
in
the
hall
saying
that
her
mother
proposed
to
come
to
lunch
it
did
not
interfere
with
the
few
minutes
nap
that
she
always
allowed
herself
on
sunday
morning
after
the
pomp
and
fatigue
of
public
worship
but
it
was
a
fact
that
her
husband
did
not
much
care
for
his
s
presence
at
his
table
for
as
mrs
keeling
said
they
were
apt
to
worry
each
other
and
consequently
mrs
goodford
s
visits
usually
took
place
on
when
mr
keeling
was
at
the
stores
but
it
did
not
ever
so
faintly
enter
her
head
to
send
round
to
say
that
she
would
not
be
at
home
for
lunch
because
in
the
first
place
she
did
not
care
sufficiently
whether
mamma
came
or
not
and
in
the
second
place
because
there
was
not
the
slightest
chance
of
mamma
s
believing
her
the
most
she
could
do
was
to
intercept
any
worrying
by
excessive
geniality
and
as
they
all
sat
down
she
remarked
pausing
before
she
began
to
cut
the
roast
beef
well
i
do
call
this
a
nice
family
party
all
of
us
at
home
and
mamma
too
this
did
not
quite
seem
to
break
the
ice
and
mrs
goodford
looked
in
some
contempt
at
her
daughter
with
her
eyes
little
and
red
and
wicked
like
an
elephant
s
her
face
was
so
deeply
wrinkled
that
her
features
were
almost
invisible
in
the
network
but
what
there
was
of
them
was
exceedingly
sharp
she
had
taken
off
her
bonnet
a
sign
that
she
meant
to
stop
all
afternoon
and
showed
a
head
very
sparsely
covered
with
white
hair
at
the
back
of
it
was
fixed
on
a
small
bun
of
bright
auburn
which
no
doubt
had
been
the
colour
of
her
hair
some
forty
years
ago
this
bun
always
fascinated
john
it
was
impossible
to
conjecture
how
it
was
attached
to
his
grandmother
s
head
mrs
goodford
ate
a
slice
of
hot
beef
in
dead
silence
with
a
circular
motion
of
her
chin
it
disappeared
before
her
daughter
had
time
to
begin
eating
on
her
own
account
which
gave
her
an
opportunity
for
another
attempt
to
thaw
the
glacial
silence
that
presided
over
the
nice
family
party
well
and
there
s
mamma
finished
her
slice
of
beef
already
what
a
blessing
a
good
appetite
is
to
be
sure
you
ll
let
me
give
you
another
slice
mamma
won
t
you
mrs
goodford
had
pointedly
taken
a
place
next
her
daughter
which
was
as
far
as
she
could
get
from
mr
keeling
and
still
without
speaking
she
advanced
her
plate
up
to
the
edge
of
the
dish
again
she
ate
in
silence
and
pushed
her
yorkshire
pudding
to
the
extreme
edge
of
her
plate
nasty
mushy
stuff
she
observed
i
d
as
soon
eat
a
john
who
had
scarcely
taken
his
eyes
off
the
bun
putting
his
food
into
his
mouth
by
general
sense
of
locality
only
suddenly
gave
a
hiccupy
kind
of
gasp
mrs
goodford
exhilarated
by
beef
turned
her
on
him
i
don
t
quite
catch
what
you
said
john
she
remarked
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
what
the
sermon
was
about
this
hell
granny
said
john
cheerfully
mrs
goodford
began
to
grow
slightly
more
bellicose
your
father
would
like
that
she
observed
hitherto
mr
keeling
had
devoted
his
mind
to
his
own
immediate
concerns
which
were
those
of
eating
he
had
no
wish
to
get
worried
with
mrs
goodford
but
it
seemed
that
mere
politeness
required
an
answer
to
this
i
found
it
an
excellent
sermon
he
said
with
admirable
neutrality
i
only
hope
that
mr
mr
silverdale
will
give
us
such
good
mrs
goodford
scrutinised
the
faces
of
her
grandchildren
her
eye
fell
on
alice
we
must
find
a
wife
for
him
she
said
i
dare
say
we
shall
be
able
to
fit
him
out
with
a
wife
he
seems
a
polite
sort
of
young
man
too
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
plenty
of
our
bracebridge
young
ladies
would
be
willing
to
become
mrs
silverside
or
whatever
the
man
s
name
dear
me
mamma
said
mrs
keeling
you
talk
as
if
the
gentleman
was
a
bit
of
mostly
bones
as
far
as
i
could
see
said
mrs
goodford
still
not
taking
her
little
eyes
off
alice
there
wasn
t
much
beef
on
well
i
hope
he
ll
get
a
good
meal
this
evening
said
mrs
keeling
he
s
taking
his
supper
with
ah
i
dare
say
he
ll
find
something
he
likes
said
this
dreadful
old
lady
observing
with
malicious
pleasure
that
alice
s
colour
as
she
would
have
phrased
it
was
a
certain
measure
of
relief
came
to
poor
alice
at
this
moment
for
she
observed
that
everybody
had
finished
the
and
she
and
hugh
who
had
at
present
escaped
the
lash
of
his
grandmother
s
tongue
and
john
hastily
got
up
and
began
changing
their
elders
plates
and
removing
dishes
this
was
the
custom
of
sunday
lunch
at
mrs
keeling
s
and
a
sabbatarian
design
of
saving
the
servants
trouble
lay
at
the
back
of
it
the
detail
of
which
it
took
no
account
was
that
it
gave
hugh
and
alice
and
john
three
times
as
much
trouble
as
it
would
have
given
the
servants
for
they
made
endless
collisions
with
each
other
as
they
went
round
the
table
two
of
them
simultaneously
tried
to
drag
the
roast
beef
away
in
opposite
directions
and
the
gravy
spoon
tipped
up
by
john
s
elbow
careered
through
the
air
with
a
of
congealed
behind
it
ominous
sounds
of
from
heaped
plates
and
knives
came
from
the
dinner
wagon
where
the
used
china
was
piled
and
some
five
minutes
of
arduous
work
filled
with
bumpings
and
crashings
and
occasional
spurts
of
suppressed
laughter
from
john
who
like
a
true
wit
was
delighted
with
his
own
swift
and
disconcerting
reply
to
his
granny
were
needful
to
effect
the
changes
required
for
the
discussion
of
plum
tart
and
that
strange
form
of
refreshment
known
as
cold
during
these
resonant
minutes
further
conversation
between
the
elders
was
impossible
but
mrs
goodford
was
not
wasting
her
time
but
saving
up
storing
her
forces
reviewing
her
future
topics
it
was
obvious
by
this
time
that
the
family
lunch
was
going
to
be
rather
a
stormy
sort
of
passage
and
mrs
keeling
had
before
this
caught
her
husband
s
eye
and
with
dumb
movements
of
her
lips
and
querying
eyebrows
had
communicated
champagne
to
him
for
it
was
known
that
when
mrs
goodford
was
in
a
worrying
mood
a
glass
of
that
agreeable
beverage
often
restored
her
to
almost
fatuous
good
humour
but
her
husband
had
replied
aloud
certainly
not
and
assumed
his
grimmest
aspect
this
did
not
look
well
as
a
rule
he
was
content
to
suffer
mrs
goodford
s
most
disagreeable
humours
in
contemptuous
silence
now
and
then
however
and
his
wife
was
afraid
that
this
was
one
of
those
tempestuous
occasions
he
was
in
no
mind
to
lie
prone
under
insults
levelled
at
him
across
his
own
table
mrs
goodford
being
helped
first
poured
the
greater
part
of
the
cream
over
her
tart
and
began
on
hugh
hugh
would
have
been
judged
by
a
sentimental
to
be
much
the
best
looking
of
all
the
keelings
for
the
resemblance
between
him
and
the
wax
types
of
manly
beauty
which
used
to
appear
in
the
windows
of
hairdressers
establishments
was
so
striking
as
to
be
almost
uncanny
you
wondered
if
there
was
a
strain
of
hairdresser
blood
in
his
ancestors
he
had
worked
himself
up
from
the
lowest
offices
in
his
father
s
stores
he
had
been
for
the
delivery
of
parcels
he
had
sold
behind
the
counters
he
had
been
through
the
accountant
s
office
he
had
travelled
on
behalf
of
the
business
and
knew
the
working
of
it
all
from
a
to
z
in
course
of
time
he
would
become
general
manager
and
his
father
felt
that
in
his
capable
hands
it
was
not
likely
that
the
business
would
deteriorate
he
spoke
little
and
usually
paused
before
he
spoke
and
when
he
spoke
he
seldom
made
a
mistake
the
brilliance
of
his
appearance
was
backed
by
a
solid
and
sensible
mind
and
they
tell
me
you
re
going
to
be
married
next
hugh
said
mrs
goodford
hugh
considered
this
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
by
next
grandmamma
he
said
but
it
is
quite
true
that
i
am
going
to
be
his
mother
again
tried
to
introduce
a
little
lightness
into
this
sombre
opening
trust
hugh
for
not
agreeing
with
anything
he
doesn
t
understand
she
said
mrs
goodford
took
no
notice
whatever
of
this
it
is
likely
that
her
quick
little
eye
had
intercepted
the
telegraphic
suggestion
of
champagne
and
that
she
was
justly
irritated
at
her
s
rejection
of
it
she
laid
herself
out
to
be
more
markedly
disagreeable
than
usual
well
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
hope
your
miss
pemberton
isn
t
one
of
those
lively
young
ladies
who
are
always
laughing
and
joking
or
you
ll
be
fit
to
kill
her
with
your
serious
airs
i
should
never
have
guessed
that
you
were
going
to
be
a
bridegroom
in
a
few
weeks
but
you
haven
t
got
to
guess
grandmamma
said
hugh
you
know
and
i
m
told
she
has
a
nice
little
fortune
of
her
own
continued
mrs
goodford
trust
a
keeling
for
that
ah
dear
me
yes
there
are
some
that
go
up
in
the
world
and
some
that
go
down
and
i
never
heard
that
the
keelings
were
among
those
that
go
hugh
hardly
thought
about
this
at
all
before
he
answered
it
was
a
perfectly
evident
proposition
i
dare
say
not
he
said
still
yes
and
it
was
true
before
you
were
born
or
thought
of
continued
this
terrible
old
lady
your
father
didn
t
marry
so
much
beneath
him
either
ah
he
was
in
a
precious
small
way
he
was
when
he
came
your
mrs
goodford
had
now
so
to
speak
found
her
range
she
had
been
like
a
gun
that
has
made
a
few
trial
shots
dropping
a
shell
now
on
alice
now
on
hugh
but
this
last
one
went
off
right
in
the
centre
of
the
target
she
disliked
her
with
that
peculiar
animus
which
is
the
privilege
of
those
who
are
under
a
thousand
obligations
to
the
object
of
their
spite
for
since
nearly
thirty
years
ago
when
he
had
taken
emmeline
off
her
hands
till
last
christmas
when
he
had
given
her
a
new
in
addition
to
his
usual
present
of
a
hundred
pounds
keeling
had
treated
her
with
consistent
and
contemptuous
liberality
this
liberality
naturally
was
not
the
offspring
of
any
affection
the
dominant
ingredient
in
it
was
pride
however
mrs
goodford
might
behave
he
was
not
to
be
disturbed
from
his
sense
of
duty
towards
his
nor
at
present
was
he
sufficiently
provoked
to
make
any
sort
of
retort
but
merely
told
john
to
pass
him
the
sugar
mrs
goodford
finished
her
plum
tart
yes
some
do
go
up
in
the
world
she
went
on
who
d
have
thought
thirty
years
ago
that
keeling
of
the
in
the
high
street
was
going
to
be
mr
thomas
keeling
of
the
stores
a
slight
smile
appeared
on
keeling
s
grim
face
he
could
not
resist
replying
to
this
who
d
have
thought
it
do
you
ask
he
said
why
i
thought
it
i
knew
it
all
along
i
may
and
they
tell
me
you
re
going
to
be
mayor
of
bracebridge
next
year
said
mrs
goodford
delighted
to
have
drawn
him
into
conversation
with
her
if
only
she
could
engage
him
in
it
she
trusted
herself
to
make
him
lose
his
temper
before
many
minutes
were
over
yes
they
ve
told
you
right
there
said
he
or
perhaps
you
ve
got
some
fault
to
find
with
that
mrs
mrs
keeling
looked
round
in
a
distressed
and
flurried
manner
with
her
feeble
geniality
showing
like
some
pale
moon
behind
clouds
that
were
growing
rapidly
thicker
yes
and
me
the
lady
mayoress
she
said
why
i
m
ever
so
nervous
even
now
in
the
thinking
of
all
the
grand
parties
i
shall
have
to
give
and
the
hospital
will
be
finished
next
year
too
and
what
a
we
shall
have
over
that
and
what
do
you
say
now
mamma
to
having
your
cup
of
coffee
in
my
boudoir
quietly
with
alice
and
me
leaving
the
gentlemen
to
have
a
mrs
goodford
gave
a
thin
little
laugh
like
a
bat
s
squeak
no
i
ll
sit
here
a
bit
longer
she
said
and
talk
to
the
gentlemen
and
the
lord
mayor
of
bracebridge
dear
me
to
think
of
all
the
changes
we
see
and
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
there
was
more
in
store
yet
i
learned
when
i
was
a
girl
that
there
was
once
a
king
of
england
who
used
to
like
a
bit
of
stale
fish
keeling
suddenly
pointed
an
awful
forefinger
at
her
now
that
s
enough
he
said
never
in
my
life
have
i
sold
a
bit
of
bad
goods
fish
flesh
or
fowl
or
whatever
you
like
to
name
that
i
wasn
t
willing
to
take
it
back
with
humble
apologies
for
its
having
left
my
shop
not
one
atom
of
bad
stuff
did
any
one
buy
of
me
if
i
knew
it
and
any
one
who
says
different
to
that
speaks
a
if
you
ve
got
anything
to
answer
me
there
mrs
goodford
let
s
have
it
now
and
have
done
with
there
was
not
a
word
in
reply
and
after
having
given
her
good
space
to
answer
him
he
spoke
again
so
we
ll
have
no
more
talk
of
stale
fish
at
my
table
he
said
mrs
keeling
rose
well
then
i
m
sure
that
s
all
comfortably
settled
she
said
and
pray
mamma
and
you
thomas
don
t
go
worrying
each
other
any
more
when
we
might
be
having
such
a
pleasant
family
party
on
sunday
afternoon
too
come
along
with
me
mamma
and
let
s
have
our
coffee
served
in
my
boudoir
and
let
s
all
sit
and
cool
after
our
this
appeal
was
more
successful
something
in
the
simple
dignity
of
keeling
s
reply
had
silenced
her
and
she
was
led
away
like
a
wicked
little
elephant
between
her
daughter
and
alice
not
one
word
did
keeling
say
till
they
had
left
the
room
and
then
though
his
usual
allowance
of
port
on
sunday
was
one
glass
after
lunch
and
two
after
dinner
he
helped
himself
again
and
pushed
the
bottle
towards
hugh
join
your
mother
john
he
said
to
his
other
son
oh
mayn
t
i
began
john
with
an
eye
to
cherries
you
may
do
as
i
bid
you
without
more
words
said
his
father
for
a
few
minutes
he
sat
glowering
and
sipping
that
s
why
some
men
take
to
drink
he
observed
they
re
driven
silly
by
some
woman
like
your
grandmother
nag
nag
nag
it
was
alice
first
then
you
then
me
does
she
come
to
eat
her
dinner
with
us
on
sunday
just
to
insult
us
all
do
you
think
hugh
considered
this
as
he
helped
himself
i
think
that
s
part
of
her
reason
he
said
she
also
wants
to
get
a
good
dinner
for
i
expect
that
s
about
it
she
may
call
me
a
tradesman
if
she
likes
who
has
been
a
fishmonger
for
that
s
quite
true
but
she
shan
t
call
me
such
a
rotten
bad
man
of
business
as
to
send
out
stale
goods
she
wouldn
t
be
getting
her
hundred
pounds
regular
as
at
christmas
time
if
i
had
been
that
sort
of
a
you
answered
her
very
properly
i
thought
remarked
hugh
of
course
i
did
i
didn
t
want
to
do
it
never
in
my
life
have
i
wanted
to
speak
like
that
to
any
woman
let
alone
your
mother
s
mother
but
she
gave
me
no
option
now
i
m
off
to
my
he
rose
it
would
be
rather
a
good
thing
if
you
went
into
my
mother
s
room
and
had
your
cup
of
coffee
there
hugh
said
it
would
show
you
paid
no
heed
to
her
rude
maybe
it
would
but
she
might
treat
me
to
some
more
and
i
ve
no
inclination
for
them
stale
fish
indeed
chapter
ii
mr
keeling
was
accustomed
to
consider
the
hour
or
two
after
lunch
on
sunday
as
the
most
enjoyable
time
in
the
week
for
then
he
gave
himself
up
to
the
full
and
uninterrupted
pursuit
of
his
hobby
none
of
his
family
ever
came
into
his
study
without
invitation
and
since
he
never
gave
such
invitation
he
had
no
fear
about
being
disturbed
before
now
he
had
tried
to
establish
with
one
or
other
of
them
the
communication
of
his
joy
in
his
books
he
had
asked
alice
into
his
sanctuary
one
sunday
but
when
he
had
shown
her
an
exquisitely
tooled
binding
by
cameron
she
had
said
oh
what
a
pretty
cover
a
pretty
cover
somehow
alice
s
appreciation
was
more
hopeless
than
if
she
had
not
admired
it
at
all
then
opening
it
she
had
come
across
a
slightly
compromising
picture
of
bacchus
and
ariadne
and
had
turned
over
in
such
a
hurry
she
had
crumpled
the
corner
of
the
page
her
father
hardly
knew
whether
her
maidenly
confusion
was
not
worse
than
the
outrage
on
his
adored
volume
stern
moralist
and
puritan
though
he
was
this
sort
of
prudery
seemed
to
him
an
affectation
that
bordered
on
imbecility
on
another
he
had
asked
hugh
to
look
at
his
books
and
hugh
had
been
much
struck
by
the
type
of
the
capital
letters
in
an
edition
of
omar
khayyam
wondering
if
it
could
be
enlarged
and
used
in
some
advertisement
of
the
approaching
summer
sale
at
the
stores
that
s
the
sort
of
type
we
want
he
said
it
hits
you
in
the
eye
that
does
you
can
t
help
reading
what
is
written
in
very
likely
that
was
quite
true
for
hugh
had
an
excellent
perception
in
the
matter
of
attractive
type
and
arrangement
in
the
advertising
department
but
his
father
had
shut
up
the
book
with
a
snap
feeling
that
it
was
in
the
nature
of
a
profanity
to
let
the
aroma
of
business
drift
into
an
atmosphere
with
his
books
his
wife
presented
an
even
more
hopeless
case
for
she
was
apt
to
tell
her
friends
how
fond
her
husband
was
of
reading
and
how
many
new
editions
he
had
ordered
for
his
library
clearly
if
this
temple
was
to
retain
its
sense
of
consecration
he
must
permit
no
more
of
these
infidel
intruders
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
the
room
was
of
the
nature
of
a
temple
for
here
a
very
essential
and
withdrawn
part
of
himself
passed
hours
of
praise
and
worship
born
in
the
humblest
circumstances
he
had
from
the
days
when
he
slept
on
a
piece
of
sacking
below
the
counter
in
his
father
s
most
unprofitable
shop
devoted
all
the
push
all
the
activity
of
his
energies
to
the
grappling
of
business
problems
and
the
pursuit
of
to
many
this
becomes
by
the
period
of
middle
age
a
passion
not
less
incurable
than
drug
drinking
and
not
less
ruinous
than
that
to
the
nobler
appetites
of
life
but
keeling
had
never
allowed
it
thus
to
usurp
and
swamp
him
he
always
had
guarded
his
secret
garden
fencing
it
impenetrably
off
from
the
clatter
of
the
till
here
though
undeveloped
and
sundered
from
the
rest
of
his
life
grew
the
rose
of
romance
namely
the
sense
of
beauty
in
books
here
shone
for
him
the
light
which
never
was
on
sea
or
land
which
inspires
every
artist
s
dream
he
was
not
in
any
degree
creative
he
had
not
the
desire
any
more
than
the
skill
to
write
or
to
draw
when
he
lost
himself
in
reverie
over
the
printed
page
or
the
illustrations
in
his
sumptuous
editions
but
the
sense
of
wonder
and
admiration
which
is
the
oil
in
the
artist
s
lamp
burned
steadily
for
him
and
lit
with
a
flame
the
hours
he
passed
among
his
books
above
all
when
he
was
here
he
lost
completely
a
certain
sense
of
loneliness
which
was
his
constant
companion
he
did
not
at
once
pass
through
the
doors
beyond
which
lay
the
garden
of
enchantment
mrs
goodford
had
irritated
him
beyond
endurance
and
what
irritated
him
even
more
than
her
rudeness
was
the
fact
that
he
had
allowed
it
to
upset
him
he
had
thought
himself
safe
from
annoyance
by
virtue
of
his
own
contempt
but
her
gibe
about
the
stale
fish
had
certainly
pricked
him
in
spite
of
its
utter
falsity
he
would
have
liked
to
cut
off
his
usual
christmas
present
which
enabled
her
to
live
in
comfort
at
blenheim
and
tell
her
she
need
not
expect
more
till
she
had
shown
herself
capable
of
politeness
but
he
knew
he
would
not
do
this
and
with
an
effort
dismissed
the
old
lady
from
his
mind
but
other
things
extraneous
to
the
temple
had
come
in
with
him
as
he
entered
like
flies
through
an
opened
door
and
still
buzzed
about
him
his
wife
s
want
of
comprehension
was
one
of
them
it
was
not
often
that
mrs
goodford
had
the
power
to
annoy
him
so
thoroughly
as
she
had
done
but
when
she
did
all
that
emmeline
had
to
contribute
to
the
situation
was
such
a
sentence
as
what
a
pity
you
and
mamma
worry
each
other
she
did
not
understand
and
though
he
told
himself
that
in
thirty
years
he
should
have
got
used
to
that
he
found
now
and
then
and
with
unusual
vividness
that
he
had
not
done
so
she
had
never
become
a
companion
to
him
he
had
never
found
in
her
that
for
which
ultimately
a
man
is
seeking
though
at
the
time
he
may
not
know
it
when
he
goes
a
mouth
an
eyebrow
the
curve
of
a
limb
may
be
his
lure
and
having
attained
it
he
may
think
for
a
few
years
of
passion
that
in
gaining
it
he
has
gained
what
he
sought
but
unless
he
has
indeed
got
that
which
unconsciously
he
desired
he
will
find
some
day
when
the
gray
ash
begins
to
grow
on
his
burning
coals
that
though
his
children
are
round
him
there
is
but
a
phantom
opposite
to
him
the
romance
of
passion
has
burned
itself
out
and
from
the
ashes
has
no
phœnix
arisen
with
whom
he
can
soar
to
the
sun
he
desired
the
mouth
or
the
eyebrow
he
got
them
and
now
in
the
changing
lineaments
he
can
scarcely
remember
what
that
which
so
strangely
moved
him
was
like
while
in
the
fading
of
its
brightness
nothing
else
has
emerged
it
was
this
undoubtedly
which
had
occurred
in
the
domestic
history
of
keeling
s
house
he
had
been
infatuated
with
emmeline
s
prettiness
at
a
time
when
as
a
young
man
of
sternly
moral
principles
and
strong
physical
needs
the
only
possible
course
was
to
take
a
wife
while
emmeline
to
tell
the
truth
had
no
voice
in
the
matter
at
all
certainly
she
had
liked
him
but
of
love
in
any
ardent
compelling
sense
she
had
never
in
the
years
of
her
existence
shown
the
smallest
symptom
in
any
direction
whatever
and
it
was
not
likely
that
she
was
going
to
develop
the
malady
now
she
had
supposed
and
her
mother
quite
certainly
had
supposed
too
that
she
was
going
to
marry
somebody
sometime
and
when
this
strong
and
splendidly
handsome
young
man
insisted
that
she
was
going
to
marry
him
she
had
really
done
little
more
than
conclude
that
he
must
be
right
especially
when
her
mother
agreed
with
him
events
had
proved
that
as
far
as
her
part
of
the
matter
was
concerned
she
had
acted
extremely
wisely
for
since
anything
which
might
ever
so
indulgently
be
classed
under
the
broad
heading
of
romance
was
foreign
to
her
nature
she
had
secured
the
highest
prize
that
life
conceivably
held
for
her
in
enjoying
years
of
complete
and
bovine
content
when
she
wanted
a
thing
very
much
indeed
such
as
driving
home
after
church
on
sunday
morning
instead
of
walking
she
generally
got
it
and
probably
the
acutest
of
her
trials
were
when
john
had
the
measles
or
her
husband
and
mother
worried
each
other
but
being
almost
devoid
of
imagination
she
had
never
thought
that
john
was
going
to
die
of
the
measles
or
that
her
husband
was
going
to
cut
off
his
annual
christmas
present
to
her
mother
things
as
uncomfortable
as
that
never
really
came
near
her
she
seemed
to
be
as
little
liable
to
either
sorrow
or
joy
as
if
when
a
baby
she
had
been
inoculated
with
some
spiritual
serum
that
rendered
her
permanently
immune
she
was
fond
of
her
children
her
crocodile
in
the
hall
her
husband
her
comfort
and
she
quite
looked
forward
to
being
lady
mayoress
next
year
there
would
always
be
sufficient
strawberries
and
iced
coffee
at
her
garden
parties
her
husband
need
not
be
under
any
apprehension
that
she
would
not
have
proper
provision
made
dreadful
scenes
had
occurred
this
year
when
mrs
alington
gave
her
last
and
two
of
her
guests
had
been
seen
almost
pulling
the
last
strawberry
in
half
such
in
outline
was
the
woman
whom
nearly
thirty
years
ago
keeling
had
carried
off
by
the
mere
determination
of
his
will
and
in
her
must
largely
be
found
the
cause
of
the
loneliness
which
so
often
beset
him
he
was
too
busy
a
man
to
waste
time
over
regretting
it
but
he
knew
that
it
was
there
and
it
formed
the
background
in
front
of
which
the
action
of
his
life
took
place
his
wife
had
been
to
him
the
mother
of
his
children
and
an
excellent
housekeeper
but
never
had
a
spark
of
intellectual
sympathy
passed
between
them
still
less
the
light
invisible
of
romantic
comprehension
had
he
been
as
incapable
of
it
as
she
their
marriage
might
have
been
as
successful
as
to
all
appearance
it
seemed
to
be
but
he
was
capable
of
it
hence
he
felt
alone
only
among
his
books
did
he
get
relief
from
this
secret
chronic
aching
there
he
could
pursue
the
quest
of
that
which
can
never
be
attained
and
thus
is
both
pursuit
and
quarry
in
one
and
now
in
his
fiftieth
year
he
was
as
friendless
outside
his
home
as
he
was
companionless
there
the
years
during
which
friendships
can
be
made
that
is
to
say
from
boyhood
up
till
about
the
age
of
forty
had
passed
for
him
in
a
practically
incessant
effort
of
building
up
the
immense
business
which
was
his
own
property
and
even
if
he
had
not
been
so
employed
it
is
doubtful
whether
he
would
ever
have
made
friends
partly
a
certain
stark
austerity
innate
in
him
would
have
kept
intimacy
at
a
distance
partly
he
had
never
penetrated
into
circles
at
bracebridge
where
he
would
have
met
his
intellectual
equals
till
now
keeling
of
the
had
but
expanded
into
mr
keeling
proprietor
of
the
universal
stores
that
reared
such
lofty
cupolas
in
the
high
street
and
the
men
he
met
those
with
whom
he
habitually
came
in
contact
he
met
on
purely
business
grounds
and
they
would
have
felt
as
little
at
ease
in
the
secret
atmosphere
of
his
library
as
he
would
have
been
in
entertaining
them
there
they
looked
up
to
him
as
the
shrewdest
as
well
as
the
richest
of
the
prosperous
tradesmen
of
bracebridge
and
his
contributions
and
suggestions
at
the
meetings
of
the
town
council
were
received
with
the
respect
that
their
invariable
common
sense
merited
but
there
their
intercourse
terminated
he
could
not
conceive
what
was
the
pleasure
of
hitting
a
over
four
miles
of
downland
and
faced
with
blank
incomprehension
the
fact
that
those
who
had
been
exercising
their
brains
all
day
in
business
should
sit
up
over
games
of
cards
to
find
themselves
richer
or
poorer
by
a
couple
of
pounds
at
one
o
clock
in
the
morning
he
would
willingly
have
drawn
a
cheque
for
such
a
sum
in
order
to
be
permitted
to
go
to
bed
at
eleven
as
usual
he
had
no
notion
of
sport
in
any
form
neither
had
he
the
bonhomie
the
pleasure
in
the
company
of
cheerful
human
beings
as
such
which
really
lies
at
the
root
of
the
pursuits
which
he
so
frankly
despised
nor
any
zeal
for
the
chatter
of
social
intercourse
to
him
a
glass
of
whisky
and
soda
was
no
more
than
half
a
pint
of
effervescing
fluid
which
you
were
better
without
it
had
to
him
no
value
or
existence
as
a
symbol
of
good
fellowship
there
was
never
a
man
less
but
in
spite
of
the
bleakness
of
nature
here
indicated
and
the
severity
of
his
aspect
towards
his
fellow
men
he
had
a
very
considerable
fund
of
kindly
impulses
towards
any
who
treated
him
with
sincerity
an
appeal
for
help
whether
it
implied
the
expenditure
of
time
or
money
was
certainly
subjected
to
a
strict
scrutiny
but
if
it
passed
that
it
was
as
certainly
responded
to
he
was
as
reticent
about
such
acts
of
kindness
as
he
was
about
the
pleasures
of
his
secret
garden
or
the
steady
increase
in
his
annual
receipts
from
his
stores
but
all
three
gave
him
considerable
satisfaction
and
the
luxury
of
giving
was
to
him
no
whit
inferior
to
that
of
getting
charles
propert
who
presently
arrived
from
the
in
charge
of
the
boy
in
buttons
was
one
of
those
who
well
knew
his
employer
s
generosity
for
keeling
in
a
blunt
and
shamefaced
way
had
borne
all
the
expense
of
a
long
illness
which
had
incapacitated
him
the
previous
winter
not
only
continuing
to
pay
him
his
salary
as
head
of
the
book
department
at
the
stores
during
the
weeks
in
which
he
was
invalided
but
taking
on
himself
all
the
charges
for
medical
treatment
and
convalescence
he
was
an
exceedingly
man
of
two
or
and
keeling
was
far
more
at
ease
with
him
than
with
any
other
of
his
acquaintances
because
he
frankly
enjoyed
his
society
he
could
have
imagined
himself
sitting
up
till
midnight
talking
to
young
propert
because
he
had
admitted
him
into
the
secret
garden
propert
might
indeed
be
described
as
the
head
gardener
keeling
nodded
as
the
young
man
entered
and
from
under
his
big
eyebrows
observed
that
he
was
dressed
entirely
in
black
propert
he
said
i
got
that
edition
of
the
d
you
told
me
of
but
they
made
me
pay
for
the
singleton
press
edition
sir
asked
propert
yes
sit
down
and
have
a
look
at
it
it
s
a
fine
page
you
yes
sir
and
if
you
ll
excuse
me
i
really
think
you
got
it
rather
h
m
i
wonder
if
you
d
have
thought
that
if
you
had
been
the
propert
laughed
i
think
so
as
you
said
to
me
the
other
day
sir
good
work
is
always
cheap
in
comparison
with
bad
keeling
bent
over
the
book
and
with
his
eyes
on
the
page
just
touched
the
arm
of
propert
s
black
coat
no
trouble
i
hope
he
said
yes
sir
i
heard
yesterday
of
my
mother
s
very
sorry
if
you
want
a
couple
of
days
off
just
arrange
in
your
department
then
the
copy
of
the
of
the
illustrated
by
beardsley
came
yesterday
too
i
like
it
better
than
anything
i
ve
seen
of
there
s
a
very
fine
d
of
his
which
you
haven
t
got
sir
said
propert
order
it
for
me
please
the
man
could
draw
couldn
t
he
look
at
the
design
of
embroidery
on
the
coat
of
that
fellow
kneeling
there
there
s
nothing
messy
about
that
but
it
doesn
t
seem
much
of
a
poem
as
far
as
i
can
judge
not
my
idea
of
poetry
there
s
more
poetry
in
the
prose
of
the
d
take
a
cigarette
and
make
yourself
he
paused
a
moment
or
perhaps
you
d
sooner
not
stop
and
talk
after
your
news
he
said
propert
shook
his
head
no
sir
i
should
like
to
stop
of
course
the
of
the
is
artificial
it
belongs
to
its
age
it
s
got
no
more
reality
than
a
watteau
picture
watteau
asked
keeling
yes
you
ve
got
a
book
of
reproductions
of
watteau
drawings
i
don
t
think
you
cared
for
it
much
picnics
and
fêtes
and
groups
of
people
under
keeling
nodded
i
remember
stupid
insipid
sort
of
thing
i
never
could
make
out
why
you
recommended
me
to
buy
i
can
sell
it
again
for
more
than
you
paid
for
it
sir
the
price
of
it
has
gone
up
this
savoured
a
little
of
business
no
you
needn
t
do
that
he
said
it
s
a
handsome
book
enough
and
then
there
is
another
omar
indeed
sir
you
ve
got
a
quantity
of
editions
of
that
but
i
know
it
s
useless
for
me
to
urge
you
to
get
hold
of
the
original
mr
keeling
passed
him
this
latest
acquisition
quite
useless
he
said
what
a
man
wants
first
editions
for
unless
they
ve
got
some
special
beauty
i
can
t
understand
i
would
as
soon
spend
my
money
in
getting
because
they
are
rare
but
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
that
poem
what
s
he
after
is
it
some
philosophy
or
is
it
a
love
poem
or
is
he
just
a
tippler
the
conference
lasted
some
time
keeling
was
but
learning
now
through
this
one
channel
of
books
that
attitude
of
mind
which
through
instinct
whetted
and
primed
by
education
came
naturally
to
the
younger
man
and
it
was
just
this
that
made
these
talks
the
very
essence
of
the
secret
garden
propert
for
all
that
he
was
but
an
employee
at
a
few
pounds
a
week
was
gardener
there
he
knew
the
names
of
the
flowers
and
what
was
more
he
had
that
comprehension
and
love
of
them
which
belongs
to
the
true
gardener
and
not
the
specimen
grower
or
florist
only
it
was
that
which
keeling
sought
to
acquire
and
among
the
prosperous
family
friends
who
were
associated
with
him
in
the
management
of
civic
affairs
or
in
business
relationships
he
found
no
opportunity
of
coming
in
contact
with
a
similar
mind
but
propert
was
freeborn
in
this
republic
of
art
and
letters
and
keeling
was
eager
to
acquire
at
any
cost
the
sense
of
native
unconscious
citizenship
he
felt
he
belonged
there
but
he
had
to
win
his
way
back
there
he
must
have
learned
the
language
in
some
psychically
dim
epoch
of
his
existence
for
exploration
among
these
alleys
in
his
garden
had
to
him
the
thrill
not
of
discovery
but
the
more
delicate
sense
of
recollection
of
revisiting
forgotten
scenes
which
were
remembered
as
soon
as
they
disentangled
themselves
again
from
the
jungle
of
materialistic
interests
that
absorbed
him
all
the
week
mr
keeling
had
very
likely
hardly
heard
of
the
theory
of
reincarnation
and
had
some
modern
pythagoras
spoken
to
him
of
beans
he
would
undoubtedly
have
considered
it
great
nonsense
but
he
would
have
confessed
to
the
illusion
the
fancy
he
would
have
called
it
of
having
known
something
of
all
this
before
when
propert
with
his
handsome
face
aglow
and
his
eyes
alight
sat
and
turned
over
books
with
him
thus
forgetting
as
his
own
absorption
increased
to
interject
his
sentences
with
the
respectful
sir
of
their
ordinary
intercourse
keeling
ceased
to
be
the
proprietor
and
master
of
the
universal
stores
he
ceased
even
to
be
the
proprietor
of
his
own
books
they
and
their
pictures
and
their
binding
and
their
aroma
of
the
kingdom
of
intellect
and
beauty
were
common
possessions
of
all
who
chose
to
claim
them
and
belonged
to
neither
of
them
individually
any
more
than
the
french
language
belongs
to
the
teacher
who
instructs
and
the
pupil
who
learns
the
hour
that
propert
usually
stayed
had
lengthened
itself
out
so
short
was
it
to
two
before
the
young
man
looked
at
his
watch
and
jumped
up
from
his
chair
i
m
afraid
i
ve
been
staying
a
very
long
time
sir
he
said
i
had
no
idea
it
was
so
mr
keeling
got
up
also
and
walked
to
the
window
where
he
spoke
with
his
back
towards
him
i
should
like
to
know
a
little
more
about
your
family
trouble
he
said
any
other
children
beside
yourself
i
remember
you
once
told
me
your
mother
was
a
yes
sir
one
sister
said
propert
unmarried
work
for
her
living
asked
keeling
yes
sir
i
think
she
ll
come
and
live
here
with
me
said
he
she
s
got
work
in
london
but
i
don
t
want
her
to
live
there
no
quite
proper
what
s
her
work
clerical
work
including
shorthand
and
efficient
yes
sir
the
highest
certificates
in
both
she
s
a
bit
of
an
artist
too
in
drawing
and
mr
keeling
ceased
to
address
the
that
were
the
sponsors
of
his
house
s
name
and
turned
round
and
a
like
you
he
asked
propert
laughed
i
wish
i
was
a
like
her
he
said
but
in
london
you
get
so
much
more
opportunity
for
study
of
all
sorts
she
had
a
british
museum
ticket
and
studied
at
the
keeling
picked
up
the
singleton
d
and
carefully
blew
a
grain
of
cigarette
ash
from
the
opened
page
let
me
know
when
she
comes
he
said
i
might
be
able
to
find
her
some
job
if
she
still
wants
work
perhaps
your
mother
s
death
has
made
her
he
paused
a
moment
naturally
i
don
t
want
to
be
impertinent
in
inquiring
into
your
affairs
propert
he
said
don
t
think
that
but
if
i
can
help
let
me
know
going
are
you
don
t
forget
to
order
me
beardsley
s
d
he
walked
out
with
him
into
the
square
gothic
hall
with
its
hideous
tiles
its
castellated
its
painted
wheelbarrow
its
crocodile
and
observed
propert
going
towards
the
door
that
led
to
the
kitchen
passage
where
are
you
going
asked
keeling
i
always
come
and
go
this
way
sir
said
propert
keeling
opened
the
front
door
for
him
this
is
the
proper
door
to
use
when
you
come
to
see
me
he
said
he
stood
a
minute
or
two
at
the
front
door
with
broken
melodies
from
omar
khayyam
lingering
like
fragments
of
tunes
in
his
head
and
thou
beside
me
singing
in
the
wilderness
was
one
that
sang
itself
again
and
again
to
him
but
no
one
had
ever
sung
to
him
in
the
wilderness
the
chink
of
money
the
flattering
rustle
of
had
sung
to
him
in
the
high
street
and
he
could
remember
certain
ardours
of
his
early
manhood
when
the
thought
that
emmeline
was
waiting
for
him
at
home
made
him
hurry
back
from
the
establishment
which
had
been
the
which
had
developed
into
the
acres
of
and
passages
that
he
now
controlled
but
emmeline
s
presence
at
home
never
made
him
arrive
at
his
work
later
than
nine
o
clock
next
morning
no
emotion
caused
either
by
emmeline
or
had
ever
dominated
him
there
had
always
been
something
beyond
something
to
which
perhaps
his
books
and
his
sunday
afternoon
dimly
led
and
they
could
scarcely
lead
anywhere
except
to
the
wilderness
where
the
thou
yet
unencountered
made
paradise
with
singing
then
with
a
swift
and
sudden
return
to
normal
consciousness
he
became
aware
that
mrs
goodford
s
was
no
longer
drawn
up
on
the
grass
below
the
larches
and
that
he
might
without
risk
of
being
worried
again
beyond
the
usual
power
of
emmeline
to
worry
him
take
his
cup
of
tea
in
the
before
going
to
evening
service
he
found
emmeline
alone
just
beginning
to
make
tea
in
the
heavily
fluted
with
its
equipage
of
harlequin
cups
and
saucers
alice
and
john
were
somewhere
in
the
hugh
had
gone
to
see
his
young
lady
the
expression
was
mrs
keeling
s
and
she
herself
had
suffered
a
slight
eclipse
from
her
usual
geniality
owing
to
her
mother
having
stopped
the
whole
afternoon
and
having
thus
interrupted
her
reading
by
which
she
meant
going
gently
to
sleep
on
the
sofa
with
her
book
periodically
falling
off
her
lap
the
first
two
times
that
this
happened
she
almost
invariably
picked
it
up
on
the
third
occasion
she
had
really
gone
to
sleep
and
the
rumble
of
its
avalanche
did
not
disturb
her
but
the
loss
of
this
intellectual
refreshment
had
rendered
her
rather
querulous
and
since
she
was
not
of
very
vigorous
vitality
her
querulousness
oozed
in
a
leaky
manner
from
her
instead
of
discharging
itself
at
high
pressure
a
had
stuck
too
in
the
spout
of
the
which
made
that
handsome
piece
contribute
to
the
general
impression
of
dribbling
at
mrs
keeling
s
it
also
provided
her
with
another
grievance
though
not
quite
so
acute
as
that
which
took
its
rise
from
what
had
occurred
at
lunch
i
m
sure
it
s
years
since
i
ve
been
so
upset
as
i
ve
been
thomas
she
said
for
what
with
you
and
mamma
worrying
each
other
so
at
lunch
and
mamma
stopping
all
afternoon
and
biting
my
head
off
if
i
said
as
much
as
to
hope
that
her
rheumatism
hadn
t
troubled
her
lately
and
it
s
wonderful
how
little
it
does
trouble
her
really
for
i
m
sure
that
though
i
don
t
complain
i
suffer
twice
as
much
as
she
does
when
we
get
that
damp
november
weather
dear
me
this
was
always
a
bad
pourer
i
should
have
been
wiser
to
get
a
less
handsome
one
with
a
straight
spout
well
there
s
your
cup
of
tea
i
m
sure
you
ll
be
glad
of
it
but
there
are
some
days
when
everything
combines
to
vex
one
and
it
will
all
be
in
a
piece
with
what
has
gone
before
if
alice
forgets
and
takes
some
and
mr
silverdale
goes
away
thinking
that
i
m
a
stingy
housekeeper
which
has
never
been
said
of
me
keeling
failed
to
find
any
indication
of
singing
in
the
wilderness
here
nor
had
he
got
that
particular
sense
of
humour
which
could
find
provender
for
itself
in
these
almost
majestic
structures
of
incoherence
at
all
times
his
wife
s
ideas
ran
softly
into
each
other
like
the
marks
left
by
words
on
blotting
paper
now
they
exhibited
a
somewhat
greater
energy
and
ran
into
each
other
with
something
of
the
vigour
of
vehicles
moving
in
opposing
directions
i
do
not
know
whether
you
wish
to
talk
to
me
about
your
mother
your
rheumatism
your
teapot
or
your
housekeeping
he
remarked
i
will
talk
about
any
you
please
but
one
at
a
mrs
keeling
gave
him
his
cup
of
tea
and
waited
a
little
before
pouring
out
her
own
it
was
necessary
to
hold
the
teapot
so
long
in
the
air
in
order
to
extract
a
ration
of
fluid
from
it
yes
it
s
very
pleasant
for
you
thomas
she
said
spending
the
afternoon
quietly
among
your
books
and
leaving
me
to
stand
up
to
mamma
for
the
way
you
spoke
to
her
at
lunch
when
we
might
have
been
such
a
pleasant
family
party
i
don
t
deny
that
mamma
gets
worried
at
times
and
speaks
when
she
had
better
have
been
silent
but
her
husband
decided
that
it
was
her
mother
she
wished
to
talk
about
and
interrupted
you
may
tell
your
mother
this
he
said
that
i
won
t
be
called
a
seller
of
bad
goods
by
anybody
if
another
man
did
that
i
d
bring
a
libel
action
against
him
your
mother
should
remember
that
she
s
largely
dependent
on
me
and
though
she
may
detest
me
she
must
keep
a
civil
tongue
in
her
head
about
me
in
my
presence
she
may
say
what
she
pleases
of
me
behind
my
back
but
don
t
you
repeat
it
to
mrs
keeling
fractious
from
her
afternoon
of
absolute
insomnia
forced
a
small
tear
out
of
one
of
her
eyes
and
there
s
a
word
to
me
she
said
fancy
telling
me
that
my
mother
detests
my
husband
that
s
an
thing
to
say
about
it
s
an
feeling
maybe
to
have
about
anybody
said
he
but
that
s
your
mother
s
affair
and
not
mine
she
may
feel
about
me
what
she
pleases
but
i
wish
her
to
know
she
must
speak
properly
to
me
or
not
speak
at
all
i
shouldn
t
have
referred
to
it
again
unless
you
had
begun
but
now
that
you
ve
begun
it
s
best
you
should
know
what
my
opinion
on
the
subject
is
before
the
children
too
i
had
better
manners
than
that
when
i
was
in
the
mrs
keeling
began
to
fear
the
worst
and
forced
a
twin
tear
from
her
other
eye
well
what
mamma
will
do
unless
you
help
her
this
christmas
is
more
than
i
can
tell
she
said
coal
is
up
now
to
winter
prices
and
mamma
s
cellar
is
so
small
that
she
can
t
get
in
enough
to
last
her
through
and
it
s
little
enough
that
i
can
do
for
her
for
with
john
at
home
it
s
like
having
two
young
lions
to
feed
and
how
to
save
from
the
you
give
me
i
don
t
see
i
dare
say
it
would
be
better
if
mamma
got
rid
of
blenheim
for
what
it
would
fetch
and
went
into
furnished
now
who
s
been
talking
about
my
not
behaving
properly
to
your
mother
except
yourself
said
keeling
there
s
other
ways
of
saying
a
thing
than
saying
it
said
mrs
keeling
cryptically
you
speak
of
mamma
detesting
you
and
not
having
the
manners
of
a
fishmonger
and
what
s
that
but
another
way
of
saying
you
re
set
against
her
mr
keeling
regarded
his
wife
with
a
faint
twinkle
lurking
behind
his
gray
eyes
take
your
tea
emmeline
he
said
and
you
ll
feel
better
you
haven
t
had
your
nap
this
afternoon
but
have
been
listening
to
your
mother
talking
all
sorts
of
rabid
stuff
against
me
don
t
you
deny
it
now
but
just
remember
i
don
t
care
two
straws
what
she
says
about
me
behind
my
back
but
i
won
t
stand
her
impertinence
to
my
face
and
as
for
coal
in
the
winter
i
can
tell
you
that
she
still
owes
me
for
what
she
bought
at
the
stores
last
january
perhaps
i
ll
her
for
the
bill
i
m
glad
you
talked
about
coal
i
had
almost
forgotten
about
that
it
dawned
faintly
and
vaguely
on
mrs
keeling
s
mind
as
on
summits
remote
from
where
she
transacted
her
ordinary
mental
processes
that
her
husband
did
not
quite
mean
what
he
said
about
that
possibly
there
lurked
in
those
truculent
remarks
some
recondite
sort
of
humour
certainly
mamma
has
no
call
to
be
so
rude
to
you
when
you
do
so
much
for
her
she
said
just
tell
mamma
that
said
he
rising
that
s
what
i
want
her
to
the
prospect
of
mr
silverdale
s
presence
at
dinner
that
night
had
filled
alice
with
secret
and
gentle
flutterings
and
accounted
for
the
fact
that
she
wore
her
amethyst
cross
and
practised
several
of
mendelssohn
s
without
before
evening
service
in
case
she
was
asked
to
play
after
dinner
she
reaped
her
due
reward
for
these
prudent
steps
since
mr
silverdale
expressed
his
admiration
for
amethysts
at
dinner
and
afterwards
came
and
sat
close
by
the
piano
beating
time
with
scarcely
perceptible
movements
of
a
slim
white
hand
not
in
the
manner
of
one
assisting
her
with
the
rhythm
but
as
if
he
himself
pulsated
with
it
he
had
produced
an
extraordinarily
unfavourable
impression
on
john
by
constantly
calling
him
by
his
christian
name
by
talking
about
tom
brown
when
he
heard
he
was
at
rugby
and
by
using
such
fragments
of
schoolboy
slang
as
he
happened
to
recollect
from
his
boyish
days
these
in
the
rapidly
changing
vernacular
of
schoolboys
were
now
chiefly
out
of
date
but
john
saw
quite
clearly
that
the
design
was
to
be
boys
together
and
despised
him
accordingly
on
mr
keeling
he
produced
merely
the
impression
of
a
very
ladylike
young
man
of
slightly
inane
disposition
and
as
hugh
was
away
spending
the
evening
at
the
house
of
his
fiancée
mr
silverdale
was
thrown
on
the
hands
of
the
ladies
for
mutual
entertainment
with
them
he
succeeded
as
signally
as
he
had
failed
with
john
saying
that
though
preaching
a
sermon
might
be
dry
work
for
his
hearers
it
was
hungry
work
for
the
performer
eating
salmon
mayonnaise
with
great
gusto
and
remarking
across
the
table
to
john
jolly
good
grub
isn
t
it
john
a
remark
that
endeared
him
to
mrs
keeling
though
it
made
john
feel
slightly
sick
and
caused
him
to
leave
in
a
pointed
manner
on
his
plate
the
portion
of
the
good
grub
which
he
had
not
yet
consumed
like
a
wise
tactician
therefore
mr
silverdale
abandoned
the
impregnable
and
delivered
his
assaults
where
he
was
more
likely
to
be
successful
he
had
an
eager
and
joyful
manner
as
of
one
who
found
the
world
an
excellent
joke
such
a
scolding
as
i
had
before
church
from
my
housekeeper
he
said
because
i
didn
t
eat
the
buttered
scones
she
sent
me
up
for
tea
i
know
some
one
who
would
have
polished
them
off
eh
john
john
s
eye
which
had
exactly
as
much
expression
in
it
as
a
dead
codfish
s
cowed
him
for
a
moment
but
he
quickly
recovered
such
a
scolding
he
said
she
said
i
didn
t
take
sufficient
care
of
myself
and
naturally
i
told
her
that
i
had
so
many
others
to
look
after
that
i
must
take
my
turn
with
the
rest
but
when
i
told
her
that
mrs
keeling
was
going
to
take
care
of
me
this
evening
she
thought
no
more
about
the
scones
i
hadn
t
eaten
she
knew
i
should
be
well
looked
mrs
keeling
had
had
a
good
nap
before
dinner
and
her
geniality
had
quite
returned
she
had
also
seen
that
mrs
bellaway
was
right
and
that
there
was
plenty
of
mayonnaise
well
that
does
put
me
in
a
responsible
position
she
said
at
least
i
must
insist
on
your
having
just
a
morsel
more
of
the
mayonnaise
before
they
take
it
away
it
s
a
very
simple
dinner
i
m
giving
you
there
s
but
a
chicken
and
a
slice
of
cold
meat
and
a
meringue
and
a
savoury
to
mr
silverdale
laughed
gleefully
dear
me
this
is
absolute
starvation
he
exclaimed
i
should
have
eaten
my
mrs
keeling
instantly
saw
that
this
was
a
joke
i
ll
leave
my
husband
to
starve
you
over
the
port
afterwards
she
said
again
he
laughed
you
and
mr
keeling
are
spoiling
me
he
declared
though
it
must
have
required
a
singularly
vivid
imagination
to
trace
in
keeling
s
face
any
symptom
of
that
indulgent
tendency
alice
in
the
depths
of
her
shy
silly
heart
found
that
in
spite
of
his
appreciation
of
the
salmon
the
chicken
the
cold
meat
and
the
meringue
the
galahad
aspect
of
this
morning
was
growing
his
housekeeper
had
told
him
he
did
not
sufficiently
look
after
himself
it
was
clear
that
he
was
wearing
himself
out
while
the
enthusiasm
with
which
presently
he
spoke
of
his
work
deepened
the
knightly
impression
his
voice
thrilled
her
so
too
did
the
boyish
gaiety
with
which
he
spoke
of
serious
things
i
adore
my
new
parish
he
said
i
was
almost
afraid
when
i
took
the
living
i
should
find
too
little
to
do
but
coming
home
late
last
night
from
a
bedside
if
i
saw
one
drunken
man
i
must
have
seen
twenty
some
roaring
drunk
some
simply
stupidly
drunk
dear
fellows
i
asked
two
of
them
to
come
home
with
me
and
have
another
drink
and
there
was
i
in
the
middle
with
two
drunken
lads
one
with
a
black
eye
reeling
along
alfred
street
i
don
t
know
what
my
parishioners
must
have
thought
of
their
new
pastor
you
should
seen
my
housekeeper
s
face
when
i
told
her
that
i
had
brought
two
friends
home
with
mrs
keeling
paused
laying
down
on
her
plate
the
piece
of
meringue
which
was
actually
for
her
mouth
but
you
never
gave
them
another
drink
mr
silverdale
she
said
yes
my
dear
lady
i
did
ho
every
one
that
thirsteth
that
was
the
drink
i
had
for
them
dear
lads
they
were
too
tipsy
to
kneel
but
there
were
tears
in
the
eyes
of
one
of
them
before
they
had
been
with
me
five
was
that
the
one
with
the
black
eye
thought
john
if
his
mouth
had
not
been
full
he
would
have
said
so
i
saw
them
home
of
course
and
next
saturday
i
m
going
to
have
a
regular
beano
in
those
slums
beyond
the
church
don
t
be
shocked
mrs
keeling
if
it
s
your
priest
who
has
a
black
eye
on
sunday
and
the
bedside
where
you
had
been
before
asked
alice
my
dear
miss
alice
i
wish
you
could
have
been
with
me
there
was
such
an
atmosphere
of
terror
in
that
room
when
i
went
in
that
i
felt
half
stifled
the
place
was
thick
with
the
fear
of
death
i
fought
against
it
it
was
given
me
to
overcome
it
and
ten
minutes
later
that
disreputable
old
sinner
who
lay
dying
there
had
such
a
smile
of
peace
and
rapture
on
his
face
that
i
can
not
but
believe
that
he
saw
the
angels
standing
round
and
he
got
better
asked
mrs
keeling
with
breathless
interest
but
feeling
that
this
was
very
daring
conversation
mr
silverdale
laughed
as
if
this
was
an
excellent
joke
better
he
asked
he
got
well
and
sang
his
psalms
in
heaven
this
morning
i
felt
in
church
as
if
i
could
hear
his
alice
remembered
the
rapt
look
she
had
seen
there
which
her
mother
almost
profanely
had
taken
to
be
the
sign
of
an
insufficient
breakfast
and
thrilled
at
knowing
the
true
interpretation
of
it
the
rapt
look
was
there
again
now
and
seemed
to
her
the
most
adorable
expression
she
had
ever
seen
on
a
human
countenance
mrs
keeling
was
more
impressed
now
and
the
moisture
stood
in
her
kind
mild
eyes
well
i
call
that
beautiful
she
said
and
if
you
ll
let
me
know
when
the
funeral
is
i
ll
send
a
mr
silverdale
laughed
again
john
considered
he
was
for
ever
laughing
at
nothing
at
all
that
would
be
delightful
of
you
he
said
but
pray
let
us
get
rid
of
the
dreadful
word
funeral
birthday
should
it
not
be
this
was
too
much
for
john
oh
i
thought
birthday
was
the
day
you
were
born
not
the
day
you
were
buried
he
said
politely
john
said
his
mother
mr
silverdale
beamed
on
him
john
has
had
enough
shop
from
his
pastor
haven
t
you
my
dear
boy
he
said
with
the
greatest
good
humour
we
clergy
are
terrible
people
for
talking
shop
and
we
don
t
seem
to
mind
how
boring
and
tiresome
we
are
you
get
enough
jaw
at
school
pi
jaw
we
used
to
call
it
without
being
preached
at
when
you
come
but
alice
fixed
earnest
eyes
on
him
oh
do
tell
us
a
little
more
she
said
again
he
laughed
my
dear
miss
alice
i
must
come
to
you
and
your
mother
he
said
to
learn
about
my
new
parishioners
you
ve
got
to
tell
me
all
about
them
i
want
you
to
point
out
to
me
every
disreputable
man
woman
and
child
in
the
place
and
the
naughtier
they
are
the
better
i
shall
be
pleased
we
ll
rout
them
out
won
t
we
and
not
give
them
a
minute
s
peace
till
they
promise
to
be
mr
keeling
was
almost
as
surfeited
with
this
conversation
as
was
john
it
appeared
to
him
that
though
mr
silverdale
wished
to
give
the
impression
that
he
was
talking
about
his
flock
he
was
really
talking
about
himself
and
seemed
to
find
it
an
unusually
engrossing
topic
this
notion
was
strongly
confirmed
when
he
found
himself
with
him
afterwards
over
a
cigarette
and
a
glass
of
port
for
mr
silverdale
seemed
to
have
a
fund
of
anecdotes
about
besotted
and
scoffing
atheists
who
were
really
dear
fellows
with
any
quantity
of
good
in
them
as
was
proved
from
the
remarkable
response
they
invariably
made
to
his
ministrations
these
stories
seemed
to
be
about
them
but
in
each
the
point
was
that
their
floods
of
tears
and
subsequent
baptism
confirmation
or
as
the
case
might
be
were
the
result
of
the
moment
when
they
first
came
across
mr
silverdale
who
as
he
told
those
edifying
occurrences
had
an
air
of
boisterous
jollity
cracking
nuts
in
his
teeth
to
impress
john
and
sipping
his
port
with
the
air
of
a
connoisseur
to
impress
his
host
and
interspersing
the
conversions
with
knowing
allusions
to
famous
vintages
subconsciously
or
consciously
probably
the
latter
he
was
living
up
to
the
idea
of
being
all
things
to
all
men
without
considering
that
it
was
possible
to
be
the
wrong
thing
to
the
wrong
man
this
sitting
though
full
of
sparkle
was
but
brief
for
keeling
was
sure
that
his
guest
s
presence
would
be
more
welcome
to
his
wife
and
daughter
than
it
was
to
him
and
before
long
he
conducted
him
to
the
where
alice
happened
to
be
sitting
at
the
piano
dreamily
recalling
fragments
of
mendelssohn
which
she
knew
very
accurately
by
heart
with
both
pedals
down
she
had
been
watching
the
door
and
so
when
she
saw
it
opening
she
looked
towards
the
window
so
that
mr
silverdale
was
across
the
room
to
the
piano
before
she
perceived
his
entrance
then
very
naturally
she
got
up
and
under
threat
of
mr
silverdale
instantly
going
home
if
she
did
not
consent
to
sit
down
again
and
continue
resumed
her
melodies
he
came
and
sat
on
a
low
stool
close
to
her
clasped
one
knee
with
his
slim
white
hands
and
half
closed
his
eyes
now
for
a
breath
of
heaven
he
said
i
am
quite
wicked
about
music
i
adore
it
too
much
little
bits
of
anything
you
can
remember
dear
miss
alice
what
a
delicious
touch
you
alice
could
do
better
than
give
him
little
bits
thanks
to
her
excellent
memory
and
her
practice
this
afternoon
and
in
addition
to
several
without
gave
him
a
couple
of
pretty
solid
slow
movements
out
of
beethoven
s
it
was
not
altogether
her
fault
that
she
went
on
so
long
for
once
when
she
attempted
to
get
up
he
said
quite
aloud
so
that
everybody
could
hear
you
naughty
girl
sit
down
and
play
that
other
piece
at
but
when
eventually
the
concert
came
to
a
close
he
pressed
her
hand
for
quite
a
considerable
time
behind
the
shelter
of
the
piano
and
said
almost
in
a
whisper
oh
such
rest
such
refreshment
then
instantly
he
became
not
so
much
the
brisk
man
of
the
world
as
the
brisk
boy
of
the
world
again
and
playfully
insisted
on
performing
that
remarkable
duet
called
chopsticks
with
her
and
made
her
promise
that
if
mr
keeling
lost
all
his
money
and
she
had
to
work
for
her
living
she
would
give
him
lessons
on
the
piano
at
an
hour
there
was
a
little
chaffering
over
this
for
as
a
poor
priest
he
said
that
he
ought
not
to
give
more
than
five
shillings
an
hour
while
mrs
keeling
joining
in
the
pleasantries
urged
alice
to
charge
ten
the
only
possible
term
to
the
argument
seemed
to
be
to
split
the
difference
and
call
it
cash
prepaid
mr
keeling
was
appealed
to
and
thought
that
fair
but
he
thought
it
remarkably
foolish
also
alice
s
music
had
lasted
so
long
that
already
the
respectable
hour
of
ten
at
which
in
bracebridge
parties
the
crunch
of
carriage
wheels
on
the
gravel
was
invariably
heard
had
arrived
mr
silverdale
had
received
such
rest
and
refreshment
that
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
and
talked
buoyantly
and
boyishly
for
another
the
had
vanished
so
too
had
the
entranced
listener
to
slow
movements
and
his
conversation
was
more
like
that
of
a
rather
fast
young
woman
than
a
man
of
any
kind
he
told
a
with
a
distinct
point
to
it
having
warned
them
that
it
was
rather
naughty
and
eventually
jumped
up
with
a
little
scream
when
the
ormolu
clock
struck
eleven
saying
that
he
would
get
no
end
of
a
scolding
from
his
housekeeper
for
being
late
and
i
shall
never
be
asked
here
again
either
he
said
if
i
inflict
myself
on
you
so
long
mrs
keeling
i
have
had
a
dear
evening
a
dear
evening
though
i
have
wasted
so
much
of
it
in
silly
chatter
but
if
ever
i
am
asked
again
i
will
show
you
i
can
be
serious
as
he
shook
hands
with
her
and
alice
just
whispering
to
the
latter
thank
you
once
more
and
went
out
with
his
host
through
the
open
window
of
the
they
could
hear
him
whistling
oh
happy
band
of
pilgrims
as
he
ran
lightly
along
alfred
road
to
be
scolded
by
his
housekeeper
chapter
iii
thomas
keeling
was
seated
before
the
circular
desk
in
his
office
at
the
stores
and
since
nine
that
morning
when
as
usual
he
had
arrived
on
the
stroke
of
the
clock
had
been
finishing
his
study
of
the
monthly
balance
sheets
that
had
come
in
two
days
before
for
many
years
now
these
reports
had
been
very
pleasant
reading
for
the
proprietor
and
for
the
last
eighteen
months
his
accounts
had
shown
a
series
of
profits
this
was
no
matter
of
surprise
to
him
for
bracebridge
during
the
past
decade
had
grown
enormously
since
the
new
docks
at
easton
haven
ten
miles
away
had
converted
that
town
from
being
a
sleepy
into
one
of
the
first
ports
of
the
kingdom
this
had
reacted
on
bracebridge
fresh
avenues
of
villas
had
sprung
up
for
the
accommodation
business
men
who
liked
to
get
away
in
the
evening
from
crowded
streets
and
the
crackle
of
cobble
stones
while
simultaneously
the
opening
of
the
new
at
bracebridge
itself
had
implied
the
erection
of
miles
upon
miles
of
workmen
s
dwellings
from
a
business
point
of
view
to
any
who
had
business
in
the
town
these
were
very
satisfactory
circumstances
provided
that
he
was
sufficiently
to
keep
pace
with
the
growing
demand
and
not
by
letting
the
demand
get
ahead
of
his
provision
for
it
cause
or
permit
to
spring
up
rival
establishments
keeling
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
state
had
fallen
into
no
such
drowsy
error
the
growth
of
bracebridge
and
in
particular
of
those
avenues
of
villas
which
housed
so
many
excellent
customers
had
always
been
kept
pace
with
or
indeed
had
been
a
little
anticipated
by
him
he
had
never
waited
for
a
demand
to
arise
and
then
arranged
about
supplying
it
with
the
imagination
that
is
as
much
at
the
root
of
successful
as
it
is
in
slightly
different
form
at
the
root
of
successful
poesy
he
had
always
foreseen
what
customers
would
want
an
instance
had
been
the
sudden
and
huge
expansion
of
his
furniture
department
made
about
the
time
the
first
spadefuls
of
earth
were
taken
out
of
the
hillside
for
the
foundation
of
the
earliest
of
the
miles
of
villas
which
held
the
families
of
business
men
from
easton
haven
he
had
foreseen
that
profitable
incursion
risking
much
on
the
strength
of
his
with
the
result
that
now
scarcely
a
new
villa
was
built
that
was
not
furnished
from
the
stores
the
expansion
of
the
catering
department
had
been
a
similar
stroke
and
the
prosperous
business
man
of
bracebridge
ate
the
early
asparagus
from
keeling
s
stores
and
drank
keeling
s
sound
wine
as
he
sat
on
keeling
s
chair
of
the
no
suite
as
he
finished
the
perusal
of
these
most
satisfactory
renderings
of
last
month
s
accounts
keeling
felt
that
he
had
arrived
at
a
stage
at
a
plateau
on
the
high
upland
of
his
financial
prosperity
it
stretched
all
round
him
sunny
and
spacious
and
he
had
no
doubt
in
his
own
mind
as
to
whether
it
had
not
been
worth
while
to
devote
thirty
years
of
a
busy
life
in
order
to
attain
it
the
reward
of
his
efforts
namely
the
establishment
of
this
large
and
remunerative
business
and
the
enjoyment
of
an
income
of
which
a
fifth
part
provided
him
with
all
that
he
could
want
in
the
way
of
material
comfort
and
complete
ease
in
living
seemed
to
him
a
perfectly
satisfactory
return
for
his
industry
but
as
far
as
he
could
see
there
was
no
further
expansion
possible
in
bracebridge
he
had
attained
the
limits
of
commercial
prosperity
there
and
if
he
was
to
devote
his
energies
now
still
in
their
zenith
to
a
further
increase
of
fortune
he
knew
that
this
expansion
must
take
the
form
of
establishing
fresh
branches
of
business
in
other
towns
he
did
not
for
a
moment
doubt
his
ability
to
succeed
elsewhere
as
he
had
succeeded
here
for
he
had
not
in
the
course
of
his
sober
industrious
life
arrived
at
any
abatement
of
the
forces
that
drive
an
enterprise
to
success
but
the
doubt
assailed
him
as
to
whether
it
was
worth
while
he
asked
himself
for
what
reason
he
should
continue
to
rise
early
and
late
take
rest
and
he
could
not
give
himself
an
adequate
answer
in
material
affluence
he
had
all
and
more
than
he
could
possibly
need
his
family
was
already
amply
provided
for
and
the
spur
of
another
ten
thousand
a
year
had
not
so
it
appeared
now
that
the
time
for
its
application
had
arrived
a
rowel
that
stimulated
him
he
had
often
foreseen
the
coming
of
this
day
and
in
imagination
had
seen
himself
answer
to
its
call
but
now
that
the
day
had
definitely
come
he
had
but
a
dull
ear
for
its
summons
the
big
manufacturing
town
of
nalesborough
thirty
miles
off
was
as
he
knew
an
admirable
centre
for
the
establishment
of
another
branch
of
his
business
and
he
had
already
secured
a
two
years
option
on
a
suitable
site
there
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
not
instantly
exercise
this
option
and
get
plans
prepared
at
once
true
there
was
another
year
of
the
option
still
to
run
and
during
that
time
the
site
was
still
potentially
his
but
he
knew
well
as
he
sat
and
debated
with
himself
that
it
was
not
through
such
hesitancy
as
this
that
his
cupolas
aspired
so
high
there
was
waiting
for
him
if
he
chose
to
put
out
the
energy
and
capacity
that
were
undoubtedly
his
a
vast
increase
of
income
but
though
an
increase
of
income
was
that
which
had
been
the
central
purpose
of
his
last
thirty
years
he
was
still
uncertain
as
to
his
future
course
he
was
conscious
or
some
part
of
him
that
perhaps
which
dwelt
in
his
secret
garden
was
conscious
that
he
really
did
not
want
any
more
money
though
for
years
he
had
so
much
taken
for
granted
that
he
did
that
the
acquisition
of
it
had
become
a
habit
as
natural
to
him
as
breathing
he
folded
and
docketed
the
sheets
that
showed
the
monthly
profits
and
most
unusually
for
him
at
this
busy
hour
of
the
morning
sat
idly
at
his
desk
the
business
of
his
stores
here
whirled
along
its
course
automatically
with
hugh
who
had
been
so
sedulously
trained
in
his
father
s
school
to
look
after
it
and
no
longer
needed
his
daily
supervision
with
the
income
which
came
to
him
from
years
of
prudent
investment
he
wanted
no
more
and
he
wondered
whether
the
time
was
come
to
turn
the
business
into
a
company
as
vendor
he
would
receive
a
considerable
block
of
shares
and
yet
leave
the
company
with
an
excellent
return
for
their
money
hugh
would
probably
become
general
director
and
he
himself
secure
in
an
ample
fortune
would
have
all
his
time
at
his
own
disposal
next
year
it
is
true
he
would
be
mayor
of
bracebridge
which
would
leave
him
but
little
leisure
for
he
had
no
notion
of
being
anything
but
a
head
of
the
town
s
municipal
affairs
but
after
that
he
could
retire
from
active
life
altogether
as
far
as
offices
and
superintendence
went
but
he
by
no
means
looked
forward
to
a
life
of
idleness
the
secret
garden
should
spread
its
groves
he
would
live
permanently
in
the
busy
cultivation
of
it
but
it
must
spread
itself
considerably
he
must
be
immersed
in
its
atmosphere
and
lawns
and
thickets
as
thoroughly
as
hitherto
he
had
been
immersed
in
the
fortunes
of
the
stores
of
a
sudden
vistas
not
wholly
new
to
him
but
at
present
very
vaguely
contemplated
rushed
into
focus
some
three
years
ago
when
at
the
age
of
fourteen
john
would
naturally
have
taken
his
place
in
the
stores
beginning
at
the
bottom
even
as
hugh
had
done
keeling
had
determined
his
destiny
otherwise
and
had
sent
him
to
a
public
school
in
taking
this
step
he
had
contemplated
the
vista
that
now
was
growing
distinct
and
imminent
john
was
to
enter
a
sphere
of
life
which
had
not
opened
its
gate
to
his
father
the
public
school
should
be
succeeded
by
the
university
the
university
by
some
profession
in
which
a
perfectly
different
standard
of
person
from
that
to
which
his
father
belonged
made
honourable
careers
putting
it
more
bluntly
john
was
to
be
a
gentleman
though
there
was
no
one
less
of
a
snob
than
keeling
he
knew
the
difference
between
what
john
had
already
begun
to
be
and
himself
perfectly
well
already
john
walked
talked
entered
a
room
sat
down
got
up
in
a
manner
quite
different
from
that
of
the
rest
of
his
family
even
his
mother
the
daughter
of
the
captain
even
alice
for
all
the
french
german
and
music
lessons
with
which
her
girlhood
had
been
made
so
laborious
a
time
had
not
keeling
found
it
hard
to
define
his
thought
to
himself
a
certain
unobtrusive
certainty
of
themselves
which
after
three
years
only
of
a
public
school
was
as
much
a
personal
possession
of
john
s
as
his
brown
eyes
and
his
white
teeth
that
quality
had
grown
even
as
john
s
stature
had
grown
each
time
he
came
back
for
his
holidays
and
it
was
produced
apparently
by
mere
association
with
gentlemen
little
as
keeling
thought
of
mr
silverdale
he
was
aware
that
mr
silverdale
had
that
quality
too
he
might
be
silly
and
affected
and
unmanly
but
when
he
and
john
ten
days
ago
had
sat
opposite
each
other
on
sunday
evening
john
sick
and
disgusted
silverdale
familiar
and
though
he
appeared
to
talk
about
drunkards
it
was
easy
to
see
that
they
both
belonged
to
a
different
class
from
the
rest
of
them
keeling
admired
and
envied
the
quality
whatever
it
was
which
produced
the
difference
and
since
association
with
those
who
had
it
produced
it
he
saw
no
reason
to
suppose
that
it
was
out
of
his
reach
there
were
plenty
of
people
in
bracebridge
who
possessed
it
but
except
at
meetings
and
on
official
occasions
he
did
not
come
in
contact
with
them
as
as
proprietor
and
managing
director
of
the
stores
he
moved
in
a
society
quite
distinct
from
those
to
whom
john
was
learning
so
quickly
to
belong
but
he
could
see
them
tellingly
contrasted
with
each
other
if
he
cared
to
walk
along
alfred
street
past
the
church
where
he
was
so
regular
an
attendant
on
sunday
to
where
there
stood
side
by
side
the
two
social
clubs
of
bracebridge
namely
the
bracebridge
club
to
which
he
himself
and
other
business
men
belonged
and
next
door
the
county
club
from
which
those
of
his
own
social
standing
were
excluded
the
bracebridge
club
was
far
the
more
flourishing
of
the
two
its
were
always
full
of
sleek
and
prosperous
merchants
having
their
glass
of
sherry
before
lunch
or
reading
the
papers
when
they
arrived
in
the
pleasant
hour
after
offices
and
shops
were
shut
in
the
evening
these
premises
were
always
crowded
at
the
sociable
hours
of
the
business
day
and
at
the
last
committee
meeting
the
subject
of
an
extension
of
accommodation
had
been
discussed
there
was
no
such
congestion
next
door
where
retired
colonels
and
occasional
canons
of
the
cathedral
and
county
magnates
in
bracebridge
for
the
day
spoke
softly
to
each
other
or
sought
the
isolation
of
a
screening
newspaper
in
a
leather
but
the
quality
which
keeling
found
so
hard
to
define
and
so
easy
to
recognize
and
which
to
him
was
perfectly
distinct
from
any
snobbish
appreciation
of
position
or
title
brooded
over
those
portals
of
the
county
club
in
the
families
of
those
who
frequented
it
the
produce
of
his
own
secret
garden
grew
wild
as
it
were
the
culture
the
education
of
which
it
was
the
fruit
were
indigenous
to
the
soil
he
did
not
suppose
that
colonel
crawshaw
or
canon
arbuthnot
or
lord
inverbroom
discussed
or
the
d
any
more
than
did
alderman
james
or
phillips
but
there
was
the
soil
from
which
culture
sprang
just
as
from
it
sprang
that
indefinable
air
of
breeding
which
already
he
observed
in
john
one
day
he
had
seen
john
standing
in
the
window
there
with
colonel
crawshaw
and
his
son
who
was
a
schoolfellow
of
john
s
and
keeling
s
heart
had
swelled
with
a
strange
mixture
of
admiration
and
envy
to
see
how
much
john
was
at
ease
sitting
on
the
arm
of
a
big
chair
and
with
a
nameless
insouciance
of
respect
refusing
a
cigarette
which
colonel
crawshaw
had
offered
him
lord
inverbroom
stood
by
john
and
john
was
perfectly
at
ease
in
these
surroundings
that
was
a
tiny
instance
but
none
could
have
been
more
typical
keeling
wanted
with
the
want
of
a
thirsty
man
not
so
much
to
belong
to
the
county
club
as
to
feel
himself
at
ease
there
if
he
did
belong
he
was
roused
from
this
quarter
of
an
hour
s
reverie
most
unusual
to
him
in
the
middle
of
the
morning
by
the
entrance
of
one
of
the
porters
with
a
card
on
a
tray
his
lordship
is
waiting
sir
he
said
and
wants
to
know
if
you
can
see
him
for
ten
keeling
took
the
card
which
he
found
to
concern
the
man
of
whom
he
had
this
moment
been
thinking
lord
inverbroom
was
lord
lieutenant
of
the
county
who
lived
some
six
miles
outside
bracebridge
in
a
house
famed
for
its
library
and
pictures
its
owner
had
held
office
in
the
last
conservative
cabinet
and
was
now
an
indefatigable
promoter
of
county
interests
keeling
met
him
with
tolerable
frequency
on
various
boards
and
there
was
no
one
in
the
world
for
whom
he
entertained
a
profounder
respect
i
ll
see
him
he
said
show
him
next
moment
lord
inverbroom
entered
he
was
small
and
spare
and
highly
finished
in
face
and
wore
extraordinarily
shabby
clothes
of
which
no
one
least
of
all
himself
was
conscious
mr
keeling
he
said
with
great
cordiality
i
owe
you
a
thousand
apologies
for
intruding
but
i
have
quite
a
decent
no
excuse
necessary
my
lord
said
keeling
please
take
a
thanks
now
i
won
t
occupy
your
time
more
than
i
can
help
i
have
come
to
consult
you
about
the
county
hospital
of
which
as
you
know
i
am
chairman
we
have
a
meeting
in
half
an
hour
from
now
the
notice
of
which
by
some
mistake
never
reached
me
till
this
morning
that
s
my
excuse
for
descending
on
you
like
he
paused
a
moment
there
s
a
very
serious
state
of
affairs
he
said
we
have
a
heavy
deficit
this
last
year
and
unless
we
can
find
some
means
of
raising
money
we
shall
have
to
abandon
the
building
of
that
new
wing
which
we
began
in
the
spring
i
m
glad
to
say
that
was
not
my
fault
else
i
shouldn
t
have
ventured
to
come
to
you
for
i
only
became
chairman
a
couple
of
months
ago
now
we
are
going
to
have
the
honour
of
having
you
for
our
mayor
next
year
and
i
wanted
to
consult
you
as
to
whether
you
thought
it
possible
that
the
town
would
lend
us
a
sum
of
money
to
enable
us
to
complete
this
new
wing
which
in
my
opinion
is
essential
for
the
proper
establishment
of
the
hospital
would
such
a
scheme
have
your
support
the
committee
is
meeting
as
i
said
in
half
an
hour
and
if
possible
i
should
like
to
be
able
to
tell
them
that
some
such
project
is
or
will
be
under
what
sum
do
you
require
asked
keeling
eighteen
thousand
that
means
twenty
said
keeling
it
probably
means
twenty
assented
lord
inverbroom
we
should
pay
i
suppose
four
or
five
per
cent
on
the
keeling
tapped
the
table
impatiently
with
his
fingers
this
was
business
and
in
his
opinion
rotten
business
and
considering
that
last
year
there
was
a
deficit
he
said
where
would
you
get
your
money
to
pay
the
interest
that
could
be
managed
i
think
i
may
say
i
could
guarantee
and
how
about
the
repayment
of
the
loan
itself
asked
keeling
how
will
that
be
guaranteed
the
hospital
is
working
at
a
loss
i
don
t
mind
that
so
much
appeals
can
be
made
to
wipe
off
small
deficits
on
working
expenses
but
an
institution
that
is
working
at
a
loss
can
t
get
a
further
loan
from
a
public
body
without
giving
some
security
for
its
repayment
at
least
if
i
was
on
that
public
body
i
would
resign
my
place
rather
than
consent
to
it
what
sort
of
balance
sheet
would
we
have
to
show
the
taxpayers
no
my
lord
that
s
quite
out
of
the
secretly
he
wondered
at
the
obtuseness
of
this
man
who
had
thought
such
a
scheme
within
the
wildest
range
of
possibilities
for
himself
he
would
not
have
lent
a
sixpence
either
of
his
own
or
of
public
money
on
such
an
enterprise
yet
he
knew
that
lord
inverbroom
had
been
a
foreign
secretary
of
outstanding
eminence
diplomatic
one
who
had
earned
the
confidence
of
the
public
without
doubt
he
had
great
qualities
but
they
did
not
appear
to
embrace
the
smallest
perception
on
the
subject
of
business
lord
inverbroom
nodded
to
him
and
rose
i
quite
see
your
point
mr
keeling
he
said
now
you
put
it
to
me
so
plainly
i
only
wonder
that
i
did
not
think
of
it
before
i
am
afraid
we
shall
have
a
melancholy
as
he
spoke
he
became
aware
that
keeling
was
not
paying
the
smallest
attention
to
him
he
appeared
unconscious
of
him
his
finger
still
tapped
his
desk
and
he
was
frowning
at
his
then
he
dismissed
as
if
settled
whatever
was
occupying
his
mind
how
much
has
been
spent
on
the
new
wing
already
he
asked
approximately
eight
thousand
and
that
will
be
thrown
away
unless
you
raise
twenty
thousand
more
not
permanently
thrown
away
i
hope
but
it
will
give
us
no
return
in
the
way
of
hospital
and
the
new
wing
on
your
guarantee
is
urgently
needed
asked
keeling
i
can
assure
you
of
keeling
sat
silent
for
a
moment
longer
then
he
rose
too
i
will
present
your
committee
with
the
entire
new
wing
he
said
it
will
be
called
after
me
the
keeling
wing
i
do
not
wish
my
gift
to
be
made
public
as
yet
i
should
like
that
done
as
soon
as
it
is
complete
at
the
opening
in
fact
that
should
take
place
during
my
year
of
office
as
lord
inverbroom
held
out
his
hand
i
won
t
keep
you
any
longer
mr
keeling
he
said
and
any
words
of
thanks
on
my
part
are
superfluous
may
i
just
tell
my
committee
that
an
anonymous
donor
has
come
forward
and
that
we
can
proceed
with
the
work
yes
that
will
i
envy
you
your
munificence
said
lord
inverbroom
as
soon
as
his
visitor
was
gone
keeling
went
straight
on
with
his
morning
s
work
there
were
a
couple
of
heads
of
departments
to
see
and
after
that
consulting
his
memoranda
he
found
he
had
made
an
appointment
to
interview
a
new
private
in
place
of
one
whom
he
had
lately
been
obliged
to
dismiss
opposite
the
entry
was
the
word
propert
and
he
recollected
that
this
was
the
miss
propert
who
had
lately
come
to
live
with
her
brother
presently
in
answer
to
his
summons
she
came
in
and
as
his
custom
was
with
his
employees
he
remained
seated
while
she
stood
i
have
looked
through
your
testimonials
miss
propert
he
said
and
they
seem
satisfactory
your
work
will
be
to
take
down
my
correspondence
in
the
morning
in
shorthand
and
bring
it
back
typewritten
for
signature
after
luncheon
the
hours
will
be
from
nine
till
five
with
an
hour
s
interval
saturday
half
day
your
salary
will
be
shillings
a
thank
you
very
much
sir
said
she
you
will
do
the
typewriting
in
that
small
room
off
this
you
have
a
machine
of
your
own
yes
sir
i
brought
it
down
this
very
well
i
engage
you
from
there
is
a
good
deal
to
do
this
morning
if
you
are
ready
we
will
begin
at
in
five
minutes
norah
propert
had
deposited
her
typewriter
in
the
next
room
and
was
sitting
opposite
her
employer
with
the
breadth
of
the
big
table
between
them
as
she
had
stood
in
front
of
him
keeling
noticed
that
she
was
tall
now
as
she
sat
with
her
eyes
bent
on
her
work
he
hardly
noticed
that
she
was
with
her
light
hair
dark
eyebrows
and
firm
mouth
what
was
of
far
greater
importance
was
that
she
tore
the
sheets
off
her
very
swiftly
and
noiselessly
as
each
page
was
filled
and
that
when
she
came
to
some
proper
name
she
spelled
it
aloud
for
confirmation
occasionally
when
a
letter
was
finished
he
told
her
to
read
it
aloud
and
there
again
he
noticed
not
the
charming
quality
of
her
voice
so
much
as
the
distinctness
with
which
she
read
for
some
hour
and
a
half
this
dictation
went
on
with
interruption
when
heads
of
departments
brought
in
reports
or
when
keeling
had
to
send
for
information
as
to
some
point
in
his
correspondence
he
noticed
that
on
these
occasions
she
sat
with
her
pencil
in
her
hand
so
as
to
be
ready
to
proceed
as
soon
as
he
began
again
once
she
corrected
him
about
a
date
that
had
occurred
previously
in
a
letter
and
was
right
that
is
all
he
said
at
the
end
i
will
read
them
over
and
sign
them
as
soon
as
they
are
she
had
her
hands
full
of
the
sheets
and
he
walked
with
her
as
far
as
the
door
of
the
very
small
room
where
the
typewriting
was
to
be
done
and
opened
it
for
her
it
was
built
out
under
the
tiles
and
was
excessively
hot
and
stuffy
on
this
warm
september
morning
i
shall
be
here
till
one
if
you
want
to
ask
me
anything
he
said
and
shut
the
door
between
her
little
cabin
and
his
big
cool
room
this
door
was
heavily
padded
at
the
edges
so
that
the
clack
of
the
typewriter
hardly
reached
him
it
was
not
keeling
s
usage
to
take
any
step
concerning
finance
or
business
without
considering
where
that
step
would
take
him
though
that
consideration
could
often
be
condensed
into
a
moment
s
insight
the
thought
of
his
sudden
munificence
with
regard
to
the
hospital
occupied
his
mind
when
he
settled
down
to
work
again
as
little
as
did
the
thought
of
his
new
typist
whom
he
had
just
shut
up
in
the
stuffy
little
chamber
adjoining
his
own
momentary
as
had
been
the
time
required
for
his
offer
his
determination
to
make
it
was
but
the
logical
next
step
in
the
secret
ambition
which
had
so
long
been
growing
in
his
mind
indeed
his
interview
with
lord
inverbroom
had
been
his
opportunity
no
less
than
the
hospital
s
and
it
would
have
been
very
unlike
him
not
to
take
advantage
of
it
but
he
was
not
going
to
snatch
at
the
fruit
which
it
would
help
to
bring
within
his
reach
he
had
no
wish
that
the
committee
or
the
town
generally
should
learn
the
identity
of
the
benefactor
until
at
the
opening
the
name
of
the
new
wing
should
flash
on
the
assembled
gathering
that
opening
must
be
a
day
of
pomp
and
magnificence
in
course
of
time
he
would
talk
over
that
with
lord
inverbroom
at
present
he
had
plenty
of
occupations
to
concern
himself
with
and
noticing
the
very
fluent
clacking
that
came
faintly
from
behind
the
padded
door
he
filed
the
accounts
which
he
had
found
so
satisfactory
and
buried
himself
in
business
again
it
was
barely
four
o
clock
when
miss
propert
came
in
with
her
sheaf
of
typewritten
correspondence
for
his
inspection
and
signature
he
had
thought
that
this
would
occupy
her
for
at
least
an
hour
longer
and
as
he
read
it
over
he
looked
for
signs
of
carelessness
that
should
betray
haste
rather
than
speed
but
none
such
revealed
themselves
all
she
had
done
was
exceedingly
accurate
and
neat
and
showed
no
trace
of
hurry
he
passed
each
sheet
over
to
her
when
he
had
read
and
signed
it
for
her
to
place
it
in
its
envelope
and
looking
across
the
table
without
raising
his
eyes
he
noticed
the
decision
and
swiftness
of
her
fingers
as
she
folded
the
paper
with
sharp
accurate
creases
he
liked
seeing
things
handled
like
that
that
was
the
way
to
do
a
job
whether
that
job
was
the
giving
of
a
wing
to
the
hospital
or
the
insertion
of
a
letter
into
its
envelope
you
knew
what
you
meant
to
do
and
did
it
and
though
it
was
not
his
habit
to
praise
work
when
it
was
well
done
for
he
paid
for
its
being
well
done
but
only
to
find
fault
with
work
badly
done
since
work
badly
done
was
not
worth
the
hire
of
the
labourer
he
felt
moved
to
give
a
word
of
commendation
i
see
you
can
work
quickly
as
well
as
carefully
he
said
i
will
do
my
best
to
satisfy
you
sir
she
answered
he
looked
at
her
and
saw
that
her
face
seemed
flushed
that
no
doubt
was
owing
to
the
heat
of
the
room
where
she
had
been
working
he
pushed
a
ledger
and
a
pile
of
typewritten
sheets
towards
her
i
want
those
entered
by
hand
in
the
ledger
he
said
you
can
use
that
table
over
there
in
the
window
when
that
is
finished
you
can
for
another
the
two
worked
on
at
their
separate
tables
the
girl
never
once
raised
her
eyes
from
her
task
but
sat
with
one
hand
following
down
the
list
of
names
and
figures
while
with
the
other
she
entered
them
in
their
due
places
in
the
ledger
but
her
employer
more
than
once
looked
up
at
her
and
noted
as
he
had
noted
before
the
decision
and
quickness
of
her
hands
and
as
he
had
not
noted
before
the
distinction
of
her
profile
she
was
remarkably
like
her
handsome
brother
she
was
also
like
the
picture
of
one
of
the
in
an
illustrated
edition
of
the
but
he
gave
less
thought
to
that
than
to
the
fact
that
he
had
evidently
secured
an
efficient
secretary
he
came
to
the
end
of
his
day
s
work
before
her
and
rose
to
go
you
can
leave
the
ledger
on
this
table
when
you
have
finished
he
said
she
raised
her
eyes
for
a
yes
sir
she
said
your
brother
tells
me
you
are
as
devoted
to
books
as
he
said
keeling
this
time
she
did
not
look
up
yes
sir
i
am
very
fond
of
them
she
said
finishing
an
entry
keeling
went
out
through
his
book
department
where
he
nodded
to
propert
into
the
bustle
of
the
square
noticing
with
a
satisfaction
that
never
failed
him
as
he
walked
by
the
various
doors
of
his
block
of
building
how
busy
was
the
traffic
in
and
out
of
the
stores
it
was
still
an
hour
to
sunset
on
the
left
the
municipal
offices
and
rose
pretentious
and
hideous
against
the
blue
of
the
southern
sky
while
in
front
to
the
west
the
gray
gothic
glories
of
the
cathedral
separated
from
the
square
by
a
line
of
canonical
houses
aspired
high
above
the
and
in
the
close
the
fact
struck
him
that
the
front
of
the
with
its
wealth
of
fussy
adornment
its
meaningless
rows
of
polished
marble
pilasters
its
foolish
little
pinnacles
and
finials
was
somehow
strangely
like
the
in
his
own
house
with
its
decorations
selected
by
the
amazingly
futile
taste
of
his
wife
there
was
a
very
similar
confusion
of
detail
about
the
two
a
kindred
ostentation
of
unnecessary
objects
there
was
waste
in
them
both
expense
that
was
not
represented
on
the
other
side
of
the
ledger
by
a
credit
balance
of
efficiency
no
one
took
pleasure
in
the
little
pink
granite
pilasters
between
the
lights
of
the
windows
in
the
and
certainly
they
were
entirely
useless
the
money
spent
on
them
was
thrown
away
whereas
money
spent
ought
to
yield
its
dividend
producing
either
something
that
was
useful
or
something
that
gave
pleasure
if
you
liked
a
thing
it
was
worth
paying
for
it
if
it
was
directly
useful
it
was
worth
paying
for
it
but
where
was
the
return
on
the
money
spent
on
pink
pilasters
or
on
the
lilies
painted
on
the
huge
above
his
wife
s
those
lilies
certainly
were
not
useful
since
they
prevented
the
mirror
exercising
its
proper
function
of
reflecting
what
stood
in
front
of
it
or
did
they
yield
a
dividend
in
pleasure
to
emmeline
he
did
not
believe
that
they
did
he
felt
sure
that
she
had
just
bought
no
suite
suite
with
extras
as
set
forth
in
his
catalogue
he
knew
the
catalogues
well
with
extras
no
suite
came
to
it
had
much
in
common
with
the
front
of
the
so
too
if
you
came
to
consider
it
had
the
crocodile
with
the
in
the
abominable
hall
the
day
as
miss
propert
had
already
discovered
in
her
little
stuffy
den
was
exceedingly
hot
and
airless
and
keeling
when
he
had
passed
through
the
reverberating
square
and
under
the
arch
leading
into
the
cathedral
close
found
it
pleasant
to
sit
down
on
one
of
the
benches
below
the
which
soared
loftily
among
the
tombs
of
the
disused
graveyard
facing
the
west
front
of
the
cathedral
owing
to
miss
propert
s
rapidity
in
typewriting
he
had
left
the
stores
half
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
and
here
thanks
to
her
was
half
an
hour
of
leisure
gained
for
which
he
had
no
imperative
employment
the
quiet
gray
graves
with
standing
out
from
the
smooth
mown
grass
formed
his
foreground
behind
them
sprang
the
flying
buttresses
of
the
nave
they
were
intensely
different
from
the
decorations
of
the
they
had
as
he
for
all
his
ignorance
in
architecture
could
see
an
obvious
purpose
to
serve
like
the
arm
of
a
strong
man
akimbo
they
gave
the
sense
of
strength
like
the
legs
of
a
strong
man
they
propped
that
glorious
trunk
they
were
decorated
it
is
true
and
the
decoration
served
no
useful
purpose
but
somehow
the
carved
appeared
a
work
of
love
a
fantasy
done
for
the
pleasure
of
its
performance
an
ecstasy
of
the
hammer
and
chisel
and
of
him
who
wielded
them
they
were
like
flames
on
the
edge
of
a
smouldering
log
of
wood
he
felt
sure
that
the
man
who
had
executed
them
had
enjoyed
the
work
or
at
the
least
the
man
who
had
planned
them
had
planned
them
you
might
say
for
elsewhere
on
the
battlemented
angles
of
the
nave
were
grotesque
gargoyles
of
devils
and
bats
and
nameless
winged
things
with
lead
spouts
in
their
mouths
to
carry
off
the
from
the
roof
commercially
they
might
perhaps
have
been
omitted
and
a
more
economical
device
of
piping
have
served
the
same
purpose
but
they
had
about
them
a
certain
joy
of
execution
there
was
imagination
in
them
something
that
justified
them
for
all
their
nightmare
hideousness
the
people
who
made
them
laughed
in
their
hearts
they
executed
some
strange
dream
and
put
it
up
there
to
glorify
god
but
the
man
who
perpetrated
the
little
pink
granite
pilasters
on
the
and
the
man
who
painted
the
lilies
on
the
above
mrs
keeling
s
had
nothing
to
justify
them
the
lilies
and
the
pilasters
were
no
manner
of
good
there
was
a
difference
between
them
the
flying
buttresses
and
the
gargoyles
but
the
latter
gave
pleasure
they
paid
their
dividends
to
any
one
who
looked
at
them
so
did
the
verses
in
to
those
who
cared
to
read
them
they
were
justified
too
in
a
way
that
no
suite
was
not
justified
for
the
that
with
extras
it
cost
the
purchaser
dimly
like
the
moving
of
an
unborn
child
the
sense
of
beauty
that
profitless
thing
without
which
there
is
no
profit
in
all
the
concerns
of
the
world
began
to
trouble
keeling
with
a
livelier
indication
of
life
than
any
that
he
had
yet
experienced
from
it
in
some
disconnected
way
it
was
connected
with
john
s
education
and
lord
inverbroom
s
manner
and
the
denizens
of
the
windows
of
the
county
club
as
opposed
to
those
who
more
numerously
gathered
in
the
windows
of
the
town
club
next
door
propert
his
salesman
in
the
book
department
had
a
cousinship
to
these
men
who
made
gargoyles
and
beautiful
books
whereas
emmeline
was
only
cousin
to
the
pilasters
in
the
town
hall
and
the
no
suite
propert
s
sister
according
to
her
brother
s
account
had
the
same
type
of
relationship
as
himself
but
the
main
point
about
her
was
her
swiftness
in
shorthand
writing
and
the
accuracy
of
her
transcription
on
to
the
typewriting
machine
keeling
had
never
had
a
secretary
who
finished
a
heavy
day
s
work
in
so
short
a
time
he
owed
her
the
extra
s
leisure
which
had
led
to
this
appreciation
of
the
gargoyles
and
buttresses
of
the
cathedral
for
thirty
years
he
had
passed
this
way
almost
daily
but
until
he
had
never
seen
them
before
in
the
sense
that
seeing
means
a
digestion
of
sight
behind
him
where
he
sat
ran
a
hedge
of
clipped
hornbeams
bordering
the
asphalt
walk
that
led
through
the
graveyard
it
was
still
in
full
leaf
and
completely
screened
him
from
passengers
going
through
the
close
there
had
been
many
passengers
going
along
the
path
there
and
he
had
heard
a
score
of
sentences
spoken
as
they
passed
within
a
yard
of
him
behind
the
hornbeam
hedge
sentence
after
sentence
had
entered
his
ears
without
being
really
conveyed
to
his
brain
then
suddenly
close
behind
him
he
heard
a
voice
speaking
very
distinctly
it
said
this
it
s
so
horrid
to
work
for
a
cad
charles
i
haven
t
done
it
before
oh
i
know
he
was
awfully
kind
to
you
the
voice
merged
into
the
buzz
of
autumn
noises
and
footsteps
and
other
conversation
but
it
had
stood
apart
and
distinct
keeling
knew
he
recognised
the
voice
but
for
the
moment
could
not
put
a
name
to
its
owner
it
was
a
woman
s
voice
very
distinct
and
pleasant
in
tone
and
in
order
to
satisfy
a
sudden
unreasonable
curiosity
he
got
up
from
his
seat
and
looking
out
down
the
path
over
the
hornbeam
hedge
saw
but
a
few
yards
down
the
path
the
head
of
his
book
department
and
his
sister
the
very
efficient
secretary
and
typewriter
whom
he
had
engaged
that
morning
their
heads
were
turned
to
each
other
and
there
was
no
doubt
whatever
about
their
identity
well
nothing
could
possibly
matter
less
to
him
so
it
seemed
at
that
moment
than
what
his
typewriter
thought
about
him
all
that
mattered
was
what
he
thought
about
his
typewriter
whom
he
considered
a
very
efficient
young
woman
who
got
through
her
work
with
extraordinary
accuracy
and
speed
he
did
not
care
two
straws
whether
she
considered
him
a
cad
for
what
signified
the
opinion
of
a
girl
whose
sole
connection
with
you
was
the
nimbleness
of
her
fingers
employed
at
shillings
a
week
as
long
as
she
did
her
work
well
she
might
take
any
view
she
chose
about
her
employer
who
for
his
part
had
no
views
about
her
except
those
concerned
with
the
speed
and
accuracy
of
her
transcriptions
and
then
even
as
he
assured
himself
that
he
was
as
indifferent
to
her
opinion
as
the
moon
he
found
himself
hating
the
fact
that
she
thought
him
a
cad
why
had
she
thought
that
he
asked
himself
he
had
been
perfectly
polite
to
her
with
the
icy
aloofness
of
the
employer
he
had
even
melted
a
little
from
that
for
he
had
opened
the
door
for
her
to
go
into
her
typewriting
den
because
her
hands
were
full
of
the
papers
that
composed
her
work
why
a
cad
then
he
gave
orders
to
his
mind
to
dismiss
the
matter
and
with
his
sauntering
walk
that
carried
him
so
quickly
over
the
ground
continued
his
way
homewards
but
despite
his
determination
he
found
that
his
thoughts
went
hovering
back
to
that
unfortunate
and
unintentional
piece
of
eavesdropping
he
wondered
whether
charles
propert
agreed
with
his
sister
as
if
that
mattered
either
and
quite
strongly
hoped
that
he
did
not
certainly
keeling
had
been
kind
enough
and
generous
enough
to
him
then
more
decidedly
still
he
pished
the
whole
subject
away
there
were
other
things
in
the
world
to
think
about
for
the
next
week
miss
propert
continued
to
display
a
galaxy
of
unvarying
excellence
in
her
duties
and
keeling
though
he
told
himself
that
he
had
dismissed
her
overheard
criticism
from
his
mind
altogether
and
perhaps
believed
that
he
had
done
so
acted
towards
her
in
sundry
little
ways
as
if
he
consciously
deprecated
her
opinion
and
sought
to
change
it
the
weather
for
instance
continuing
very
hot
he
ordered
an
electric
fan
to
be
placed
in
the
small
stuffy
den
where
she
did
her
work
saying
nothing
about
it
to
her
but
setting
it
going
while
she
was
absent
for
her
hour
s
interval
in
the
middle
of
the
day
on
another
occasion
when
he
was
sitting
at
his
table
with
his
hat
on
he
took
it
off
as
she
entered
on
a
third
he
cleared
a
space
for
her
to
write
at
when
she
came
to
receive
his
dictation
for
the
morning
in
part
though
he
would
have
denied
it
his
dislike
of
her
verdict
on
him
prompted
these
infinitesimal
courtesies
but
in
part
another
incentive
dictated
them
vaguely
and
distantly
she
was
beginning
to
mean
something
to
him
personally
she
was
acquiring
a
significance
apart
from
her
duties
he
began
to
notice
not
only
the
speed
and
efficiency
of
her
fingers
but
the
comely
shape
of
her
hand
he
began
to
heed
not
only
the
distinctness
of
her
voice
as
she
read
over
her
shorthand
transcripts
to
him
but
its
quality
it
reminded
him
rather
of
john
s
voice
and
oftener
and
oftener
as
he
dictated
his
correspondence
he
looked
up
with
his
gray
eyes
set
deep
below
their
bushy
eyebrows
at
that
quiet
handsome
face
which
hardly
ever
raised
its
eyes
to
his
somehow
her
perfect
fulfilment
of
the
complete
duties
of
the
secretary
devoid
of
any
other
human
relationship
to
him
whatever
began
to
pique
him
she
treated
him
as
if
he
had
no
existence
apart
from
his
function
as
her
employer
he
had
never
before
had
so
ideal
a
secretary
so
intelligent
and
accurate
a
piece
of
and
now
having
got
it
he
was
inconsistent
enough
to
harbour
a
smothered
wish
that
she
was
a
shade
more
human
in
her
dealings
with
him
he
wished
that
she
would
not
call
him
sir
so
invariably
whenever
she
spoke
to
him
he
looked
out
for
the
smallest
indication
on
her
part
of
being
conscious
of
him
in
some
human
manner
but
no
such
indication
appeared
and
the
complete
absence
of
it
vexed
him
though
as
often
as
it
vexed
him
the
vexation
was
the
smallest
of
annoyances
he
strenuously
denied
to
himself
that
such
a
feeling
existed
at
all
in
his
mind
he
had
made
an
engagement
with
her
brother
that
he
should
come
up
one
sunday
afternoon
some
fortnight
after
miss
propert
had
entered
his
employment
to
spend
a
couple
of
hours
among
the
herbage
of
the
secret
garden
the
young
man
had
come
into
his
room
just
before
midday
closing
time
on
saturday
with
the
weekly
returns
of
the
lending
library
that
had
just
been
added
to
the
book
department
when
a
sudden
idea
struck
keeling
i
shall
see
you
afternoon
then
he
said
perhaps
you
will
bring
your
sister
with
you
as
you
tell
me
she
is
a
she
was
at
the
moment
in
the
little
typewriting
den
adjoining
the
door
of
which
was
open
through
it
he
could
just
see
her
hands
arranging
the
papers
on
her
table
the
rest
of
her
was
invisible
but
as
he
spoke
in
a
voice
loud
enough
to
be
heard
by
her
he
observed
that
her
hands
paused
in
the
deft
speed
of
their
tidying
and
remained
quite
motionless
for
a
second
or
two
and
he
knew
as
well
as
if
some
flawless
telegraphic
communication
had
been
set
up
between
her
brain
and
his
that
she
was
debating
in
her
mind
whether
she
should
come
or
not
she
thought
him
a
cad
but
no
doubt
she
wanted
to
see
his
books
that
was
the
message
that
came
to
him
from
her
keeling
nodded
towards
the
room
where
the
hands
had
become
busy
again
he
knew
she
had
heard
overheard
if
you
will
and
since
she
did
not
choose
to
give
her
answer
herself
he
did
not
choose
to
convey
the
invitation
to
her
again
some
faint
stirrings
of
human
relationship
began
at
that
moment
to
enter
into
living
existence
for
each
set
up
their
little
screen
of
pride
neither
would
have
done
that
had
there
not
been
something
ever
so
small
to
screen
will
you
ask
her
he
said
to
her
brother
she
is
in
he
waited
hat
and
stick
in
hand
while
a
couple
of
sentences
passed
between
them
then
charles
came
out
she
is
very
much
obliged
to
you
sir
he
said
she
will
be
very
much
pleased
to
damned
condescending
of
her
thought
keeling
to
himself
what
right
had
a
secretary
at
shillings
a
week
to
send
him
messages
through
her
brother
but
if
a
message
was
to
be
sent
he
was
glad
it
was
that
one
keeling
received
the
two
next
afternoon
in
his
secret
garden
and
had
taken
the
trouble
to
bring
in
a
couple
of
more
comfortable
chairs
for
the
first
time
he
looked
at
his
secretary
without
the
sundering
spectacles
of
the
employer
and
on
the
instant
became
aware
that
she
on
her
side
had
so
to
speak
taken
off
the
blinkers
of
the
employed
she
was
here
as
his
guest
asked
by
him
personally
because
he
wished
to
welcome
her
and
show
her
his
books
and
her
eyes
instead
of
being
glued
to
her
work
met
his
with
a
frank
cordiality
he
was
not
accustomed
to
shake
hands
with
her
brother
on
his
sunday
visits
here
but
the
girl
advanced
to
him
with
her
hand
out
presupposing
his
welcome
whatever
hesitancy
she
might
have
had
in
accepting
his
invitation
she
had
by
the
fact
of
her
accepting
it
put
her
indecision
completely
away
and
for
the
first
time
she
smiled
at
him
it
was
so
good
of
you
to
let
me
come
and
see
your
books
mr
keeling
she
said
my
brother
has
often
told
me
what
delightful
sunday
afternoons
he
has
passed
with
you
he
did
not
fail
to
notice
that
he
was
sir
no
longer
but
mr
keeling
nor
did
he
fail
to
grasp
the
significance
he
was
sir
in
his
office
he
was
mr
keeling
in
his
house
somehow
that
pleased
him
it
was
like
a
in
a
comedy
your
brother
has
often
been
very
useful
to
me
in
my
collecting
he
said
with
a
hint
of
employer
still
lingering
in
his
attitude
towards
him
she
sat
down
in
one
of
the
big
chairs
that
keeling
had
brought
in
that
was
the
purpose
for
which
he
had
fetched
them
but
for
the
moment
he
put
on
his
again
to
observe
the
unusual
sight
of
his
secretary
sitting
unbidden
while
he
stood
then
the
girl
s
complete
and
unconscious
certainty
that
she
knew
how
to
behave
herself
whisked
them
from
in
front
of
his
eyes
again
and
he
saw
only
his
guest
sitting
there
to
whom
were
due
his
powers
of
entertaining
and
interesting
her
charles
tells
me
you
go
in
for
beautiful
books
rather
than
rare
ones
she
said
charles
have
you
told
mr
keeling
about
the
official
italian
book
on
leonardo
no
i
was
going
to
mention
it
to
you
sir
he
said
leonardo
asked
keeling
yes
leonardo
da
vinci
immediately
she
saw
that
he
had
never
heard
of
him
and
without
pause
conveyed
incidental
information
it
will
reproduce
all
pictures
certainly
by
him
she
said
and
a
quantity
of
his
sketches
with
his
drawings
of
flying
machines
the
venice
ones
you
know
it
will
be
published
to
subscribers
keeling
nodded
to
charles
will
you
see
to
that
for
me
he
asked
yes
sir
it
s
published
at
isn
t
it
norah
yes
or
is
it
ah
there
s
the
singleton
press
d
may
i
look
at
that
it
is
one
i
have
never
seen
ah
what
a
page
what
type
for
the
next
hour
the
three
burrowed
into
or
nibbled
at
keeling
s
volumes
now
losing
themselves
completely
in
the
interest
which
was
in
common
between
them
now
for
a
moment
conscious
of
their
mutual
relations
as
employer
and
employed
but
those
intervals
grew
rarer
and
in
keeling
s
mind
were
replaced
by
the
new
consciousness
of
his
secretary
with
her
mask
off
she
on
her
part
found
no
difficulty
in
separating
her
employer
from
mr
keeling
with
this
really
wonderful
collection
of
beautiful
modern
books
and
indeed
there
was
little
in
common
between
them
the
hobby
was
like
a
thawing
sun
of
february
that
uncongealed
the
ice
of
the
office
and
as
long
as
it
shone
on
them
the
melting
seemed
not
less
than
a
complete
break
up
of
the
frost
lord
inverbroom
lives
near
does
he
not
she
asked
that
s
a
wonderful
library
is
the
public
allowed
to
see
it
i
suppose
not
i
would
not
trust
charles
within
arm
s
length
of
a
caxton
if
i
had
kind
of
you
remarked
charles
my
sister
designed
and
cut
a
for
him
keeling
saw
her
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
just
shake
her
head
at
her
brother
and
she
instantly
changed
the
subject
the
reason
seemed
clear
enough
in
the
midst
of
these
walls
of
books
that
had
no
such
decoration
but
she
need
not
have
shown
such
delicacy
he
thought
to
himself
for
he
had
no
notion
of
ordering
a
plate
from
her
and
very
soon
she
rose
we
must
be
off
charles
she
said
if
we
are
to
have
our
walk
thank
you
so
much
mr
keeling
for
showing
me
your
he
was
sorry
she
was
going
but
made
no
attempt
to
detain
her
and
presently
she
was
walking
back
along
the
still
sunny
road
with
her
brother
i
m
sorry
i
called
him
a
cad
she
said
he
s
only
a
cad
in
his
office
perhaps
my
dear
did
you
see
the
crocodile
holding
a
tray
for
cards
what
an
awful
nice
books
said
charles
very
he
s
worthy
of
them
too
he
really
likes
them
perhaps
they
ll
civilise
him
do
you
know
i
feel
rather
a
brute
for
having
gone
why
because
i
don
t
like
him
but
he
s
kind
and
that
makes
it
worse
what
does
he
think
about
apart
from
his
books
just
money
i
suppose
i
won
t
go
there
again
until
he
gets
the
leonardo
she
sighed
i
shall
have
to
then
if
he
asks
me
she
said
or
couldn
t
you
manage
to
steal
it
charles
made
no
definite
promise
on
this
point
and
they
walked
on
for
a
little
in
silence
i
m
not
even
quite
certain
if
i
do
dislike
him
she
said
have
you
been
thinking
about
that
all
this
time
he
asked
i
suppose
i
must
have
been
let
s
think
about
something
chapter
iv
alice
keeling
was
sitting
close
to
the
window
of
her
mother
s
room
making
the
most
of
the
fading
light
of
a
gray
afternoon
at
the
end
of
october
and
busily
fashioning
leaves
of
gold
thread
to
be
the
sumptuous
foliage
of
no
less
sumptuous
purple
pomegranates
among
which
sat
curious
ecclesiastical
fowls
resembling
parrots
the
gold
thread
had
to
be
tacked
into
its
place
with
stitches
of
gold
silk
and
this
strip
of
gorgeous
embroidery
would
form
when
completed
part
of
the
decoration
of
an
for
the
church
which
till
but
a
few
weeks
ago
had
not
even
had
an
altar
at
all
but
only
a
table
many
other
changes
had
occurred
in
that
hitherto
uncompromising
edifice
the
tables
of
commandments
had
vanished
utterly
a
faint
smell
of
incense
hung
permanently
about
the
church
copiously
renewed
every
sunday
candles
blazed
vestments
flashed
and
a
confessional
undoubtedly
roman
in
origin
blocked
up
a
considerable
part
of
the
vestry
but
chief
of
all
the
changes
was
that
of
the
personality
of
the
vicar
and
second
to
that
the
state
of
mind
of
the
parish
in
general
to
which
taking
it
collectively
the
word
christian
could
not
properly
be
applied
but
taking
the
parish
in
sections
it
would
not
be
in
the
least
improper
to
apply
the
word
ecstatic
to
that
section
of
it
to
which
alice
keeling
belonged
and
the
embroidery
on
which
she
like
many
other
young
ladies
was
employed
was
not
less
a
work
of
love
than
a
work
of
piety
as
the
blear
autumnal
light
faded
and
her
mother
dozed
quietly
in
her
chair
having
let
her
book
fall
from
her
lap
for
the
third
time
alice
peering
at
the
almost
completed
leaf
would
have
suffered
her
eyes
to
drop
out
of
her
head
rather
than
relinquish
her
work
she
was
sewing
little
fibres
and
shreds
of
her
heart
into
that
pomegranate
leaf
and
it
gave
her
the
most
exquisite
satisfaction
to
do
so
it
would
have
been
easy
so
the
simple
and
person
would
think
for
her
to
have
turned
on
the
electric
light
and
have
saved
her
eyes
but
there
were
subtler
and
more
compelling
reasons
which
stood
in
the
way
of
doing
that
the
first
was
that
the
light
would
almost
certainly
awaken
her
mother
who
by
beginning
to
talk
again
as
she
always
did
when
a
nap
had
refreshed
her
would
put
an
end
to
alice
s
private
reflections
which
flourished
best
in
dusk
and
in
silence
a
second
reason
was
that
it
was
more
than
likely
that
mr
silverdale
would
presently
drop
in
for
tea
and
it
was
decidedly
more
interesting
to
be
found
sitting
at
work
with
her
profile
outlined
against
the
smouldering
glow
of
sunset
than
to
be
sitting
under
the
less
becoming
glare
of
an
electric
lamp
for
the
same
reason
she
did
not
put
on
the
spectacles
which
she
would
otherwise
have
worn
the
leaf
was
all
but
finished
when
her
mother
began
to
talk
with
such
suddenness
that
alice
wondered
for
the
moment
whether
she
was
but
talking
in
her
sleep
but
the
gist
of
her
remarks
was
slightly
too
consecutive
to
admit
of
that
supposition
though
it
looks
very
odd
she
said
beginning
to
give
utterance
to
her
reflections
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
that
your
father
and
hugh
should
go
to
cathedral
while
you
and
i
go
to
st
thomas
s
but
the
cathedral
is
very
draughty
that
s
what
i
always
say
and
with
my
autumn
cold
due
if
not
overdue
it
would
be
flying
in
the
face
of
providence
to
encourage
it
by
sitting
in
draughts
as
for
incense
and
confession
and
her
voice
suddenly
ceased
again
as
if
a
tap
been
turned
off
by
some
external
agency
and
alice
wisely
made
no
reply
of
any
kind
feeling
sure
that
in
a
minute
or
two
her
mother
would
begin
to
give
vent
to
that
faint
snoring
which
betokened
that
she
had
gone
to
sleep
again
that
did
not
interrupt
the
flow
of
her
ecstatic
musings
whereas
her
mother
s
general
attitude
to
all
the
novel
institutions
which
were
so
precious
to
her
gave
her
a
tendency
to
strong
shudderings
only
half
an
hour
ago
mrs
keeling
had
said
that
she
was
sure
she
saw
nothing
wrong
in
confession
and
would
not
mind
going
herself
if
she
could
think
of
anything
worth
telling
mr
silverdale
about
alice
had
drawn
in
her
breath
sharply
when
her
mother
said
that
as
if
with
a
pang
of
spiritual
toothache
there
came
a
slight
sound
from
the
next
door
which
would
have
been
inaudible
to
any
but
expectant
ears
and
alice
bent
over
her
work
with
more
intense
industry
then
the
door
opened
very
softly
and
mr
silverdale
looked
in
he
was
dressed
in
a
black
cassock
and
had
a
long
wooden
shepherd
s
crook
in
his
hand
he
saw
alice
seated
in
the
window
he
saw
mrs
keeling
with
her
mouth
slightly
open
and
her
eyes
completely
shut
in
a
corner
of
the
sofa
and
rose
to
his
happiest
level
hush
he
said
very
gently
and
tiptoed
across
the
room
to
where
alice
sat
he
took
her
hand
in
his
pressing
it
and
spoke
in
the
golden
whisper
which
she
was
getting
to
know
so
well
in
the
vestry
my
dear
girl
he
said
how
good
and
industrious
you
i
shall
get
it
done
well
before
christmas
whispered
alice
how
pleased
the
herald
angels
will
be
he
answered
alice
gave
a
great
jerk
of
emotion
which
most
unfortunately
upset
her
which
fell
off
the
table
with
a
crash
that
might
have
awaked
the
dead
and
certainly
awoke
the
living
and
vestments
said
mrs
keeling
again
going
on
precisely
at
the
point
where
sleep
had
overtaken
her
i
can
t
see
that
there
s
any
harm
in
them
though
your
father
there
was
a
moment
s
dead
silence
as
she
became
drowsily
aware
that
there
was
somebody
else
in
the
room
mr
silverdale
s
gay
laugh
as
he
gave
a
final
pressure
to
alice
s
hand
told
her
who
it
was
dear
lady
he
said
go
on
with
your
protestant
exhortations
i
have
been
exhorting
all
afternoon
and
i
am
so
tired
of
my
own
exhortations
we
will
listen
and
try
to
agree
with
you
won
t
we
miss
alice
mrs
keeling
got
up
in
some
confusion
bless
me
to
imagine
your
having
come
in
while
i
was
so
busy
thinking
about
what
i
had
been
reading
that
i
never
heard
the
door
open
she
said
hastily
picking
up
the
book
which
had
fallen
face
downwards
on
the
floor
well
i
m
sure
it
s
time
for
tea
how
the
evenings
draw
in
but
there
are
unpleasanter
things
than
a
muffin
and
a
chat
by
the
fire
when
all
s
said
and
alice
seemed
inclined
to
prefer
her
pomegranates
to
muffins
and
had
to
be
personally
conducted
from
her
work
and
told
she
was
naughty
by
mr
silverdale
who
sat
on
the
hearthrug
with
woollen
stockings
and
very
muddy
boots
protruding
from
below
his
cassock
for
he
had
had
a
game
of
football
with
his
boys
club
before
his
afternoon
preaching
he
had
only
just
had
time
to
put
on
his
cassock
and
snatch
up
his
shepherd
s
crook
when
the
game
was
over
and
ran
to
church
getting
there
in
the
nick
of
time
but
he
had
kicked
two
goals
at
his
football
and
talked
to
twice
that
number
of
penitent
souls
afterwards
in
the
vestry
so
as
he
delightedly
exclaimed
he
had
had
excellent
sport
and
he
poked
the
fire
with
his
shepherd
s
crook
and
you
didn
t
go
home
and
change
after
your
football
asked
alice
you
are
too
bad
you
promised
me
you
would
he
held
up
apologetic
hands
and
spoke
in
baby
voice
i
vewy
sowwy
he
said
i
be
dood
i
m
not
sure
i
shall
forgive
you
said
alice
radiantly
please
if
i
have
another
cup
of
tea
to
keep
the
cold
out
well
just
this
once
said
alice
pouring
him
out
another
cup
he
fixed
his
fine
eyes
on
the
fire
and
became
so
like
the
figure
of
jonah
in
the
window
that
alice
almost
felt
herself
in
nineveh
i
m
getting
spoiled
here
he
said
all
you
dear
ladies
of
bracebridge
positively
spoil
me
with
your
and
our
extra
cups
of
tea
i
m
getting
too
comfortable
and
here
s
miss
alice
with
a
cigarette
at
my
elbow
but
i
don
t
know
whether
it
s
allowed
have
one
with
me
miss
alice
and
then
your
mother
will
have
to
scold
us
both
and
i
know
she
s
too
fond
of
you
to
scold
this
was
slightly
too
daring
an
experiment
for
alice
but
she
resolved
to
have
a
try
in
her
bedroom
that
night
indeed
it
s
allowed
said
mrs
keeling
but
as
for
alice
smoking
well
that
is
a
good
joke
and
as
for
your
being
too
comfortable
i
call
that
another
i
call
it
a
very
bad
one
said
alice
delightedly
mr
silverdale
is
very
naughty
you
mustn
t
encourage
him
mamma
to
think
he
is
funny
when
he
is
only
naughty
she
went
to
the
window
and
brought
back
her
strip
of
pomegranates
you
re
naughty
too
he
said
this
is
and
now
there
s
something
else
i
want
to
talk
about
you
ladies
are
the
queens
of
your
homes
don
t
you
think
you
could
persuade
mr
keeling
not
to
think
me
the
thin
edge
of
the
pope
so
to
speak
delicious
said
alice
beginning
to
be
naughty
with
her
pomegranates
mrs
keeling
shook
her
head
it
s
no
use
she
said
you
can
have
incense
or
mr
keeling
but
not
both
and
such
a
draughty
pew
as
he
s
got
in
the
cathedral
it
isn
t
only
his
attendance
there
that
i
mean
said
mr
silverdale
but
you
know
his
stores
are
in
my
parish
and
he
employs
some
four
hundred
there
i
went
to
see
him
at
his
office
this
morning
and
asked
him
if
i
couldn
t
have
a
daily
service
for
he
didn
t
refuse
said
alice
he
said
they
might
all
do
what
they
liked
out
of
their
work
hours
but
he
couldn
t
have
them
encroached
on
i
was
tempted
to
give
him
a
good
rap
with
my
shepherd
s
crook
but
there
was
a
lady
present
so
i
appealed
to
her
for
her
assistance
in
persuading
indeed
and
who
was
that
asked
mrs
keeling
he
introduced
me
it
was
his
secretary
such
a
handsome
girl
i
think
she
tried
to
snub
me
but
we
poor
parsons
are
unsnubbable
she
told
me
that
she
quite
agreed
with
mr
his
typewriter
dared
to
say
that
hissed
alice
oh
then
he
began
dictating
to
her
something
about
linoleums
but
i
ve
not
done
with
him
yet
the
dear
man
i
ll
plague
his
life
out
for
him
if
you
ll
only
help
a
pink
lustre
clock
of
horrible
aspect
suddenly
chimed
six
and
he
jumped
up
evensong
at
he
said
blow
evensong
there
he
picked
up
his
crook
i
ve
got
to
get
hold
of
all
you
dear
people
he
said
grasping
alice
s
long
lean
fingers
in
one
hand
and
mrs
keeling
s
plump
ones
in
the
other
and
kissing
them
both
what
an
hour
of
refreshment
i
have
had
blessings
blessings
he
ran
lightly
across
the
room
kissed
his
hand
at
the
door
and
they
heard
him
running
across
the
drawing
room
blow
evensong
said
alice
ecstatically
wasn
t
that
delicious
of
him
and
the
pope
too
the
thin
end
of
the
pope
but
how
could
father
be
so
rude
as
to
begin
dictating
about
linoleum
your
father
doesn
t
like
working
hours
interfered
with
my
dear
said
mrs
keeling
but
we
ll
do
what
we
can
anyhow
mr
silverdale
will
have
to
change
before
he
goes
to
oh
i
hope
so
said
alice
extending
her
long
neck
over
her
embroidery
not
that
it
will
do
any
good
talking
to
your
father
continued
mrs
keeling
placidly
for
i
m
sure
in
all
these
thirty
years
i
never
saw
him
so
vexed
as
when
you
and
i
said
we
should
keep
on
going
to
st
thomas
s
after
the
incense
and
the
began
but
i
had
made
up
my
mind
alice
flushed
a
little
i
wish
you
would
not
call
it
mamma
she
said
you
know
perfectly
well
that
they
are
vestments
they
all
signify
something
they
have
a
spiritual
very
likely
my
dear
said
mrs
keeling
amiably
and
i
m
sure
that
s
a
beautiful
bit
of
figured
silk
which
he
has
his
coat
made
alice
drew
in
her
breath
sharply
cope
mamma
she
said
yes
dear
i
said
coat
rejoined
her
mother
who
was
not
aware
that
she
was
a
little
deaf
alice
did
not
pursue
the
subject
and
since
there
was
now
no
chance
of
mr
silverdale
s
coming
in
again
she
put
on
her
spectacles
which
enabled
her
to
see
the
lines
of
the
pomegranate
foliage
with
far
greater
distinctness
never
before
had
she
had
so
vivid
an
interest
in
life
as
during
these
last
two
months
indeed
the
greater
part
of
the
female
section
of
the
congregation
at
st
thomas
s
had
experienced
a
similar
quickening
of
their
emotions
and
a
livelier
iris
burnished
up
the
doves
of
the
villas
in
alfred
road
the
iris
in
question
of
course
was
the
effect
of
the
personality
of
cuthbert
silverdale
and
if
he
was
not
as
he
averred
being
spoiled
the
blame
did
not
lie
with
his
parishioners
they
had
discovered
as
he
no
doubt
meant
them
to
do
that
a
had
come
among
them
a
missioner
a
crusader
and
they
vied
with
each
other
in
adoring
and
decorative
obedience
making
banners
and
embroideries
for
his
church
for
he
allowed
neither
slippers
nor
neckties
for
himself
and
in
flocking
to
his
discourses
and
working
under
his
guidance
in
the
parish
there
had
been
frantic
discussions
and
quarrels
over
rites
and
doctrines
households
had
been
divided
among
themselves
and
as
at
the
cedars
sections
of
families
had
left
st
thomas
s
altogether
and
attached
themselves
to
places
of
simpler
ceremonial
the
bishop
had
been
appealed
to
on
the
subject
of
lights
with
the
effect
that
the
halo
of
a
martyr
had
encircled
mr
silverdale
s
head
without
any
of
the
inconveniences
that
generally
attach
to
martyrdom
since
the
bishop
had
not
felt
himself
called
upon
to
take
any
steps
in
the
matter
even
a
protesting
rather
sparsely
attested
had
been
sent
him
in
counterblast
to
which
alice
keeling
with
other
enthusiastic
young
ladies
had
forwarded
within
a
couple
of
days
a
far
more
voluminously
signed
document
quoting
the
of
edward
vi
in
support
of
their
pastor
according
to
their
pastor
s
interpretation
of
it
at
his
wednesday
lectures
on
the
history
of
the
english
church
cuthbert
silverdale
was
not
unaware
of
the
emotion
which
he
had
roused
in
so
many
female
breasts
and
it
is
impossible
to
acquit
him
of
a
sort
of
clerical
complacency
in
the
knowledge
that
so
many
young
ladies
gazed
and
gazed
on
him
with
a
mixture
of
religious
and
personal
devotion
though
a
firm
believer
in
the
celibacy
of
the
clergy
he
did
not
feel
himself
debarred
from
sentimental
relations
with
both
married
and
unmarried
members
of
his
flock
indeed
the
very
fact
that
nothing
could
conceivably
come
of
these
little
mawkishnesses
made
them
appear
perfectly
licit
he
held
their
hands
and
took
their
arms
and
sat
at
their
knees
and
called
them
dear
girls
two
or
three
at
a
time
finding
safety
perhaps
in
numbers
and
not
wishing
to
encourage
false
hopes
he
was
an
incorrigible
if
an
innocent
flirt
a
licensed
practising
familiarities
which
if
indulged
in
by
the
ordinary
layman
would
assuredly
have
led
to
kickings
in
some
curious
manner
he
quite
succeeded
in
deceiving
himself
as
to
the
propriety
of
those
affectionate
demonstrations
and
considered
himself
a
sort
of
brother
to
all
those
young
ladies
who
worked
for
him
with
the
industry
and
more
than
the
excitement
of
devoted
sisters
to
do
him
justice
he
was
just
as
familiar
with
the
male
members
of
his
congregation
and
patted
his
boys
on
the
back
and
linked
his
arm
in
theirs
but
it
would
be
idle
to
contend
that
he
got
as
much
satisfaction
out
of
those
male
embraces
there
was
no
question
however
about
the
devotion
and
strenuousness
of
his
life
his
congregation
in
spite
of
the
secession
of
such
plain
men
as
mr
keeling
crammed
his
church
to
the
doors
and
spilt
into
the
street
and
he
kindled
a
religious
fervour
in
the
parish
which
all
the
terrors
of
hell
as
set
forth
by
his
predecessor
had
been
unable
to
fan
into
a
blaze
in
a
thoroughly
cheap
but
in
a
masterly
and
intelligible
manner
he
preached
the
gospel
and
in
his
life
practised
it
by
incessant
personal
exertions
of
which
others
as
well
as
himself
were
very
conscious
it
was
more
his
surface
than
his
essential
self
which
was
so
deplorable
a
mass
of
affectation
and
amorousness
and
the
horror
he
inspired
in
minds
of
a
certain
calibre
by
his
skippings
and
his
shepherd
s
crook
and
his
little
caresses
was
really
too
pitiless
a
condemnation
indeed
the
gravest
of
his
errors
was
not
so
much
in
what
he
did
as
his
omission
to
consider
what
effect
his
affectionate
dabs
and
touches
and
pawings
might
have
on
their
recipients
he
would
in
fact
have
been
both
amazed
and
shocked
if
he
could
have
been
an
unseen
witness
of
alice
keeling
s
proceedings
when
she
found
herself
in
the
privacy
of
her
own
bedroom
that
night
she
had
gone
up
to
bed
early
feeling
that
nameless
stir
of
the
spirit
which
can
only
find
expansion
in
solitude
she
wanted
to
let
herself
go
to
be
herself
and
the
presence
of
her
family
forced
her
to
wear
the
carapace
of
convention
but
having
pleaded
fatigue
at
ten
o
clock
though
her
eyes
sparkled
behind
her
spectacles
she
escaped
from
the
cramping
influence
of
the
drawing
room
and
locked
herself
into
her
own
bedroom
with
her
thoughts
and
her
glowing
she
spread
it
over
the
side
of
her
bed
and
in
front
of
it
proceeded
to
her
evening
devotions
in
the
days
these
were
the
briefest
and
most
tepid
orisons
now
they
were
invested
with
sincerity
and
worship
first
she
thought
over
her
misdoings
for
the
day
a
series
of
the
most
harmless
omissions
and
commissions
which
she
set
honestly
before
herself
she
had
not
got
up
with
the
punctuality
she
had
vowed
she
had
not
kept
her
mind
free
from
irritation
when
she
went
to
see
her
grandmother
she
had
been
guilty
of
gluttony
with
regard
to
jam
pancakes
she
had
said
she
was
tired
just
now
when
she
never
had
felt
fresher
in
her
life
then
followed
her
prayers
like
the
rest
of
her
vicar
s
numerous
she
read
a
chapter
from
the
gospels
and
she
finished
up
with
the
appointed
meditation
from
the
devotional
book
which
mr
silverdale
had
given
her
up
to
this
point
there
would
have
been
nothing
to
surprise
or
amaze
him
he
might
not
even
have
blushed
to
see
how
when
her
meditations
were
done
she
pored
over
the
title
page
where
he
had
written
her
name
with
good
wishes
from
her
friend
she
kissed
that
page
before
putting
the
book
away
in
a
box
which
contained
two
or
three
notes
from
him
which
she
read
through
before
locking
them
up
again
they
were
perfectly
harmless
little
notes
only
no
man
should
ever
have
written
them
one
had
been
received
only
this
morning
and
she
had
not
read
it
more
than
a
dozen
times
yet
it
ran
won
t
i
just
come
in
this
afternoon
after
my
football
and
my
preachment
and
get
some
opodeldoc
for
my
bruises
and
some
muffins
for
my
little
mary
and
some
refreshment
for
my
silly
tired
brain
god
bless
you
your
friend
cuthbert
that
required
much
study
he
had
never
signed
himself
like
that
before
she
wondered
if
she
could
ever
venture
to
call
him
mr
cuthbert
and
said
mr
cuthbert
out
aloud
several
times
in
order
to
get
used
to
the
unfamiliar
syllables
preachment
too
that
was
a
word
he
often
used
once
when
he
came
to
see
them
he
entered
the
room
chanting
i
admit
the
soft
impeachment
that
i
ve
been
making
alice
thought
that
quite
lovely
even
when
she
subsequently
found
out
that
the
identical
effusion
had
already
been
chanted
on
his
arrival
at
the
house
of
mrs
fyson
the
day
before
julia
fyson
her
most
intimate
friend
and
of
the
vicar
had
told
her
she
locked
up
those
treasures
and
going
to
the
window
drew
aside
the
curtain
and
looked
out
the
autumnal
fall
of
the
leaf
from
the
trees
in
the
garden
had
brought
into
view
houses
in
the
town
hidden
before
among
these
was
st
thomas
s
vicarage
that
stood
slightly
apart
from
the
others
and
was
easily
recognisable
with
the
aid
of
an
opera
glass
she
could
distinguish
the
windows
and
saw
that
a
light
was
burning
behind
the
blinds
of
his
study
he
had
come
in
then
and
for
a
full
minute
she
contemplated
the
luminous
oblong
later
she
had
sometimes
seen
that
a
window
exactly
above
that
was
lit
she
liked
seeing
that
for
it
meant
that
he
was
going
to
bed
and
would
soon
be
asleep
for
he
had
mentioned
that
he
went
to
sleep
the
moment
he
got
into
bed
once
she
had
watched
till
that
light
went
out
also
she
let
the
curtain
fall
into
place
again
and
sat
by
the
fire
for
a
little
feeling
alive
to
the
very
tips
of
her
fingers
would
be
a
busy
day
she
had
her
lesson
for
her
to
get
ready
she
and
julia
fyson
were
going
to
prepare
that
together
there
was
a
for
girls
in
the
afternoon
at
which
mr
silverdale
she
said
mr
cuthbert
aloud
again
had
promised
to
be
referee
she
was
going
to
read
the
paper
to
her
grandmother
this
was
now
a
daily
task
directly
traceable
to
the
vicar
and
her
would
fill
up
any
spare
time
but
as
the
fire
began
to
die
down
the
invigorating
prospect
of
next
day
lost
its
quality
and
there
began
to
stir
in
her
mind
a
vague
disquiet
hitherto
it
had
really
been
enough
for
her
that
mr
silverdale
existed
to
put
him
on
a
pedestal
and
adore
in
company
with
other
reverential
worshippers
had
satisfied
her
and
the
inspiration
had
resulted
in
many
useful
activities
but
she
began
to
wish
that
there
had
not
been
so
many
other
worshippers
towards
whom
he
exhibited
the
same
benignant
and
affectionate
aspect
there
was
julia
fyson
for
instance
he
would
walk
between
them
with
an
arm
for
each
and
a
pressure
of
the
hand
for
julia
as
well
as
herself
in
moments
of
expansion
she
and
julia
had
confided
to
each
other
their
adoration
and
its
rewards
they
had
sung
their
hymns
of
praise
together
and
had
bewailed
to
each
other
the
rare
moments
when
he
seemed
to
be
cold
and
distant
with
them
each
administering
comfort
to
the
other
and
being
secretly
rather
pleased
but
now
alice
felt
that
any
story
of
his
coldness
to
julia
would
give
her
more
than
a
little
pleasure
she
would
like
him
to
be
always
cold
to
julia
she
wanted
him
herself
and
at
that
moment
the
truth
struck
her
she
was
in
love
with
him
till
then
she
had
not
known
it
till
then
perhaps
there
had
been
nothing
definite
and
personal
to
know
but
now
as
the
fire
died
down
she
was
aware
of
nothing
else
and
her
heart
starved
and
cried
out
she
had
admired
and
adored
before
those
were
emotions
but
this
cried
out
for
its
due
sustenance
she
got
up
and
went
to
her
turning
on
the
electric
light
above
it
certainly
julia
was
much
prettier
than
she
with
her
mutinous
little
pink
and
white
face
and
her
violet
eyes
but
she
was
such
a
little
thing
she
hardly
came
above
alice
s
shoulder
and
alice
who
knew
her
so
well
had
often
thought
in
spite
of
her
apparent
earnestness
nowadays
that
she
was
flighty
and
undependable
with
the
that
was
the
unfortunate
fruit
of
her
newly
found
habits
of
and
confession
she
told
herself
that
julia
had
not
a
quarter
of
her
own
grit
and
character
only
the
other
day
when
he
was
walking
between
them
he
had
said
i
always
think
of
my
friends
by
then
he
had
undeniably
squeezed
julia
s
arm
and
said
you
are
sprite
just
julia
had
liked
this
and
with
the
anticipation
of
a
less
attractive
nickname
for
alice
had
said
and
what
is
she
then
had
come
a
memorable
reply
for
he
had
answered
we
must
call
her
alice
in
wonderland
she
lives
in
a
fairyland
of
her
and
he
had
squeezed
alice
s
arm
too
it
was
comforting
to
remember
that
and
alice
saw
wonder
and
wistful
pensiveness
steal
into
the
reflection
of
her
face
there
was
the
girl
who
would
upset
all
his
convictions
about
a
celibate
clergy
indeed
he
had
said
that
he
did
not
think
it
morally
wrong
for
them
to
marry
it
was
a
case
of
the
thin
end
of
the
wedge
again
not
this
time
of
the
pope
but
of
benedick
the
married
man
alice
went
once
more
to
the
window
and
lifted
the
curtain
there
was
an
oblong
of
light
in
the
window
above
his
study
she
kissed
her
hand
to
it
and
once
more
said
aloud
mr
but
it
would
have
been
juster
if
she
had
wished
him
a
nightmare
had
alice
been
in
a
condition
to
observe
any
windows
and
the
lights
in
them
except
those
of
the
dark
study
and
the
illuminated
bedroom
at
the
vicarage
she
would
have
seen
that
late
as
it
was
there
was
a
patch
of
gravel
on
the
outside
her
father
s
library
window
which
smouldered
amid
the
darkness
of
the
night
and
showed
there
was
another
wakeful
inhabitant
in
the
house
he
had
gone
to
his
room
very
shortly
after
alice
s
disappearance
from
the
drawing
room
leaving
his
wife
talking
about
table
linen
to
hugh
he
like
alice
wanted
though
more
dimly
than
she
the
expansion
of
solitude
but
when
he
got
into
that
retreat
he
found
he
was
not
quite
alone
in
it
he
had
intended
to
look
through
the
leonardo
publication
which
had
just
arrived
and
for
which
he
thought
he
thirsted
but
it
still
lay
unturned
on
the
table
he
had
but
unpacked
and
identified
it
and
in
ten
minutes
had
forgotten
about
it
altogether
another
presence
haunted
the
room
and
disquieted
him
it
was
nearly
a
month
since
the
sunday
afternoon
when
he
had
held
conference
with
the
two
properts
here
he
had
gone
back
to
his
office
on
the
following
monday
morning
feeling
that
he
had
shown
a
human
side
to
norah
she
had
done
the
same
to
him
she
had
talked
to
mr
keeling
not
to
sir
there
was
some
kind
of
communication
between
them
other
than
orders
from
an
employer
to
an
employed
and
obedience
swift
and
deft
from
the
employed
to
the
employer
when
he
arrived
at
the
office
punctual
to
nine
o
clock
with
a
large
post
awaiting
his
perusal
he
had
found
she
had
not
yet
come
and
had
prepared
a
little
friendly
speech
to
her
on
the
lines
of
mr
keeling
she
arrived
not
five
minutes
afterwards
and
he
had
consciously
enjoyed
the
sound
of
her
steps
running
along
the
passage
from
the
lift
but
when
she
entered
she
had
no
trace
of
the
previous
afternoon
i
am
late
sir
she
said
i
am
exceedingly
at
that
despite
himself
the
sunday
afternoon
mood
dried
up
also
she
was
in
the
office
again
was
she
well
so
was
he
if
she
had
only
looked
at
him
had
called
him
mr
keeling
he
would
have
been
mr
keeling
as
it
was
he
became
sir
with
a
vengeance
i
hope
it
won
t
happen
again
he
said
i
can
not
allow
unpunctuality
open
the
rest
of
the
letters
and
give
me
she
had
frozen
into
the
perfect
secretary
with
incredible
speed
she
had
the
sheaf
of
letters
before
him
and
with
her
writing
pad
in
her
hand
awaited
his
dictation
twice
during
the
next
hour
she
with
downcast
eyes
corrected
some
error
of
his
once
producing
an
impeccable
file
to
show
him
that
a
week
before
he
had
demanded
a
reduction
on
certain
wholesale
terms
once
to
set
him
right
in
a
date
regarding
previous
correspondence
she
had
been
five
minutes
late
that
morning
but
she
had
saved
him
fifty
in
future
correspondence
she
seemed
to
know
her
files
by
heart
it
was
idle
to
challenge
her
for
proof
when
she
made
a
correction
then
she
had
gone
back
with
her
shorthand
notes
to
her
room
and
all
morning
the
noise
of
her
nimble
fingers
disturbed
him
through
the
door
he
was
in
two
minds
about
that
sometimes
he
thought
he
would
send
her
into
hugh
s
room
where
another
typewriter
worked
hugh
was
accustomed
to
the
clack
of
the
machine
and
two
would
be
no
worse
than
one
then
again
he
thought
that
the
muffling
of
the
noise
alone
disturbed
him
that
if
she
sat
at
the
table
in
the
window
and
did
her
work
there
he
would
not
notice
it
it
was
the
concealed
clacking
of
the
keys
that
worried
him
perhaps
it
would
even
help
him
to
attend
to
his
own
business
to
see
how
zealously
she
attended
to
hers
those
deft
long
fingers
they
were
the
incarnation
of
the
efficiency
which
to
him
was
the
salt
of
life
five
days
had
passed
thus
and
on
the
next
saturday
he
had
asked
her
brother
and
her
this
time
giving
the
invitation
to
her
to
visit
his
library
again
she
had
refused
with
thanks
and
a
sir
but
charles
had
come
keeling
had
determined
not
to
allude
to
his
sister
s
refusal
but
had
suddenly
found
himself
doing
so
and
charles
with
respect
believed
that
she
was
having
a
friend
to
tea
and
again
despite
himself
he
had
said
on
charles
s
departure
i
hope
i
shall
see
you
both
again
some
sunday
well
he
was
not
going
to
ask
twice
after
one
refusal
of
his
favours
but
as
the
next
week
went
by
he
found
the
sir
and
the
dropped
eyes
altogether
intolerable
these
absolutely
impersonal
relationships
were
mysteriously
worrying
she
had
shown
herself
a
compatriot
of
the
secret
garden
and
now
she
had
retreated
into
the
shell
of
the
secretary
again
this
week
the
weather
turned
suddenly
cold
and
since
there
was
no
fireplace
in
her
room
he
invited
her
to
sit
at
the
table
by
the
window
in
his
which
was
close
to
the
pipes
a
certain
of
pride
had
come
to
his
aid
and
now
he
hardly
ever
glanced
at
her
but
one
day
the
whole
of
this
pride
fell
softly
on
the
table
just
as
he
took
his
hat
and
stick
after
the
day
s
work
i
wonder
if
you
would
do
a
for
me
miss
propert
he
said
i
should
like
to
have
a
for
my
she
paused
in
her
work
but
did
not
look
at
him
yes
sir
i
will
gladly
do
you
one
she
said
shall
i
draw
a
design
and
see
if
you
approve
of
it
no
i
know
nothing
of
these
things
but
i
should
like
a
similar
to
the
sort
of
thing
you
did
for
lord
he
hesitated
a
moment
as
regards
size
he
said
perhaps
you
will
come
up
and
have
a
look
at
my
books
again
and
get
a
guide
from
she
smiled
or
he
thought
she
smiled
and
that
together
with
her
reply
enraged
him
that
won
t
be
necessary
she
said
will
suit
any
volume
except
duodecimos
i
don
t
think
you
have
any
if
so
i
could
cut
the
margin
down
sir
but
i
should
like
to
submit
my
design
to
you
before
i
cut
the
that
also
will
not
be
necessary
he
said
something
in
the
style
of
lord
inverbroom
s
miss
good
afternoon
sir
said
she
it
was
extraordinary
to
him
how
this
girl
got
on
his
mind
he
thought
he
disliked
her
but
in
some
obscure
way
he
could
not
help
being
interested
in
her
there
was
somebody
there
somebody
from
whom
there
came
a
call
to
him
he
wanted
to
know
how
she
regarded
him
what
effect
he
had
on
her
and
there
were
no
data
she
sat
behind
her
impenetrable
mask
and
did
her
work
in
a
manner
more
perfect
than
any
secretary
who
had
ever
served
him
she
declined
to
come
to
his
house
with
her
brother
she
had
retreated
again
inside
that
beautiful
shell
he
noticed
infinitesimal
things
about
her
sometimes
she
wore
a
hat
sometimes
she
left
it
in
her
room
one
day
she
had
a
bandage
round
a
finger
of
her
left
hand
and
he
wondered
if
she
had
cut
herself
but
her
reserve
and
reticence
permitted
him
no
further
approach
to
her
only
he
waited
with
something
like
impatience
for
the
day
when
she
would
bring
the
block
of
his
or
an
impression
of
it
there
would
surely
be
an
opportunity
for
the
personal
relation
to
come
in
there
he
had
begun
to
know
that
moment
which
few
men
of
fifty
and
those
the
luckiest
of
all
are
unaware
of
he
wanted
a
companion
somebody
who
satisfied
his
human
not
his
corporal
needs
while
we
are
young
the
youthful
vital
force
feeds
itself
by
its
own
excursions
satisfies
itself
with
the
fact
of
its
travel
and
explorations
it
is
enough
to
go
on
to
lead
the
gipsy
life
and
make
the
supper
hot
under
the
and
sleep
sound
in
the
knowledge
that
next
day
there
will
be
more
travel
and
fresh
horizons
and
a
dawn
that
shines
on
new
valleys
and
hillsides
but
when
the
plateau
of
life
is
reached
those
are
the
fortunate
ones
who
have
their
home
already
made
for
thirty
years
he
had
had
his
own
fireside
and
his
wife
and
his
growing
children
but
never
had
he
found
his
home
some
spirit
of
the
secret
garden
had
inspired
him
and
now
he
felt
mateless
and
all
his
money
was
dust
and
ashes
in
his
mouth
two
things
he
wanted
one
to
be
different
in
breed
from
that
which
he
was
the
other
to
find
a
companion
the
shadow
of
a
companion
lurked
in
his
room
where
were
the
piles
of
his
books
somewhere
in
that
direction
lay
the
lodestone
another
week
passed
and
still
he
waited
for
some
word
from
his
secretary
about
the
he
was
not
going
to
be
eager
about
it
for
he
would
not
confess
to
himself
the
anxiety
with
which
he
awaited
an
opportunity
that
his
shillings
a
week
secretary
had
denied
him
but
day
by
day
he
scrutinized
her
face
and
wondered
if
she
was
going
to
say
that
the
was
finished
the
event
occurred
at
the
most
inopportune
moment
he
had
concluded
a
bargain
a
day
or
two
before
for
the
purchase
of
the
entire
vintage
of
a
french
in
the
bordeaux
district
and
had
just
opened
a
letter
to
say
that
owing
to
the
absence
of
a
certain
payment
in
advance
the
stock
had
been
disposed
of
to
another
purchaser
and
he
had
lost
one
of
the
best
bargains
he
had
ever
made
but
he
felt
sure
that
he
had
drawn
the
cheque
in
question
he
remembered
drawing
it
in
his
private
just
before
leaving
one
afternoon
when
the
cashier
had
already
gone
home
he
opened
the
drawer
where
he
kept
his
and
examined
it
there
it
was
it
was
true
he
had
drawn
the
cheque
but
he
had
forgotten
to
tear
it
out
and
despatch
it
meaning
no
doubt
to
do
so
in
the
morning
never
in
all
his
years
of
successful
business
had
he
made
so
stupid
an
omission
an
omission
for
which
he
would
at
once
have
dismissed
any
of
his
staff
telling
him
that
a
man
who
was
capable
of
doing
that
was
of
no
use
to
keeling
and
it
was
himself
who
had
deserved
dismissal
he
could
remember
it
all
now
he
had
locked
the
cheque
up
again
as
it
was
necessary
to
send
a
certain
order
form
with
it
and
that
was
inaccessible
now
that
his
secretary
had
gone
he
would
do
it
in
the
morning
but
when
morning
came
he
had
thought
of
nothing
but
the
request
he
was
going
to
make
that
norah
should
do
him
a
that
that
trivial
trumpery
affair
utterly
drove
out
of
his
head
this
important
business
transaction
he
was
furious
with
himself
for
his
carelessness
it
was
not
only
that
he
had
lost
a
considerable
sum
of
money
it
was
the
loss
of
that
worried
him
he
could
hardly
believe
that
he
had
shown
himself
so
rotten
a
business
man
he
might
as
well
have
sold
stale
fish
according
to
the
amiable
hint
of
his
as
have
done
this
and
at
that
unfortunate
moment
when
he
was
savage
with
himself
and
all
the
world
norah
propert
appeared
instantly
he
looked
at
his
watch
to
see
if
she
was
again
late
but
it
had
not
yet
struck
nine
it
was
he
himself
who
was
before
his
time
she
carried
a
small
parcel
with
her
of
which
she
untied
the
string
i
have
brought
the
block
of
your
sir
she
said
with
a
couple
of
impressions
of
he
held
out
his
hand
for
it
without
a
word
she
had
produced
a
charming
design
punning
on
his
name
a
ship
lay
on
its
side
with
its
keel
showing
in
the
foreground
was
a
faun
squatting
on
the
sand
reading
behind
was
a
black
sky
with
stars
and
a
large
moon
he
knew
it
to
be
a
charming
piece
of
work
but
his
annoyance
at
himself
clouded
everything
yes
i
see
he
said
what
do
you
charge
for
it
ten
pounds
she
said
that
will
include
a
thousand
he
looked
at
the
block
in
silence
for
a
moment
there
did
not
seem
to
be
much
work
on
it
he
could
get
a
woodcut
that
size
for
half
of
the
price
it
was
but
three
inches
by
two
ten
pounds
he
said
i
shouldn
t
dream
of
giving
more
than
seven
for
it
even
that
would
be
a
fancy
he
put
the
block
down
laid
the
two
impressions
on
the
top
of
it
and
turned
over
the
leaves
of
his
in
order
to
pay
for
the
thing
at
once
but
she
picked
up
her
work
and
without
a
word
began
wrapping
it
up
in
the
paper
she
had
just
taken
off
it
already
he
knew
he
had
made
a
blunder
and
the
blunder
was
the
act
of
a
cad
it
had
been
his
business
to
ask
the
price
beforehand
if
he
wanted
to
know
it
not
to
quarrel
with
it
afterwards
but
the
cad
in
him
had
full
possession
just
then
what
are
you
doing
he
said
and
glancing
up
he
found
that
for
once
she
was
looking
at
him
with
contemptuous
anger
held
perfectly
in
control
i
am
going
to
take
my
work
away
again
sir
as
you
do
not
care
to
pay
the
price
i
ask
for
it
she
said
nonsense
seven
pounds
is
a
very
good
price
i
know
the
cost
of
he
had
written
the
cheque
and
passed
it
over
to
her
she
took
no
notice
whatever
of
it
tied
the
string
round
her
parcel
and
put
it
on
the
table
in
the
window
then
still
without
a
word
she
took
up
her
pencil
and
her
and
sat
down
to
receive
his
dictation
in
his
heart
he
knew
he
was
beaten
she
had
given
him
even
a
sharper
lesson
than
he
had
given
himself
in
the
matter
of
the
cheque
he
had
forgotten
to
post
and
that
was
but
business
the
error
was
expensive
but
it
was
merely
a
matter
of
money
as
far
as
its
effects
went
he
very
much
doubted
whether
money
would
settle
this
he
still
thought
that
ten
pounds
was
an
excessive
charge
but
that
did
not
detract
from
the
fact
that
he
had
behaved
meanly
his
pride
still
choked
him
but
he
knew
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
be
obliged
to
capitulate
he
would
have
to
apologize
and
hope
that
his
apology
would
be
accepted
the
morning
s
work
went
on
precisely
as
usual
and
not
by
the
tremor
of
an
eyelash
did
she
betray
whatever
she
might
be
feeling
just
that
one
look
had
she
given
him
of
sovereign
disdain
and
the
remembrance
of
it
stiffened
him
against
her
and
he
battled
against
the
surrender
that
he
knew
must
come
if
she
was
going
to
be
proud
he
could
match
her
in
that
and
again
he
told
himself
that
seven
pounds
was
a
very
good
price
he
was
not
going
to
be
imposed
on
all
the
morning
the
went
on
within
him
and
when
she
rose
to
go
for
her
hour
s
interval
he
noticed
that
she
took
the
parcel
containing
the
with
her
and
very
he
made
an
attempt
at
surrender
come
miss
propert
he
said
let
s
have
an
end
of
this
i
should
have
asked
the
price
before
i
commissioned
you
to
do
the
work
let
me
give
you
a
cheque
for
ten
she
smiled
there
was
no
doubt
about
that
i
m
afraid
that
s
quite
impossible
sir
she
said
now
that
you
have
told
me
that
you
don
t
consider
my
work
worth
that
up
flamed
his
temper
again
at
this
what
on
earth
did
the
girl
want
more
he
had
offered
her
the
price
she
asked
he
had
said
he
was
wrong
in
not
inquiring
about
it
before
she
might
go
hang
she
and
her
niceties
and
her
contempt
she
had
come
back
in
the
afternoon
without
her
parcel
and
his
imagination
pictured
her
telling
her
brother
all
that
had
happened
he
felt
he
must
have
cut
a
sorry
figure
that
s
the
end
of
his
books
and
his
for
me
would
be
the
sort
of
way
norah
would
sum
it
all
up
probably
they
did
not
discuss
it
much
there
really
was
very
little
need
for
comment
on
what
he
had
done
the
simple
facts
were
sufficient
perhaps
she
had
smiled
again
as
she
smiled
when
she
rejected
his
first
overtures
all
afternoon
they
worked
within
a
few
yards
of
each
other
all
afternoon
his
accusing
conscience
battered
at
his
pride
and
as
she
rose
to
go
when
the
day
s
work
was
over
he
capitulated
he
stood
up
also
grim
and
stern
to
the
view
but
beset
with
a
shy
pathetic
anxiety
that
she
would
accept
his
regrets
i
want
to
ask
your
pardon
miss
propert
he
said
for
my
conduct
to
you
this
morning
i
am
sure
you
did
not
charge
me
more
than
your
work
was
worth
i
like
your
design
very
much
i
shall
be
truly
grateful
to
you
if
you
will
let
me
have
that
plate
i
am
sorry
that
s
all
i
am
it
cost
him
a
good
deal
to
say
that
but
at
every
word
his
burden
lightened
though
his
anxiety
to
know
how
she
would
deal
with
him
increased
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
quite
in
the
secret
garden
manner
and
she
smiled
not
as
she
had
smiled
when
she
left
him
this
morning
thank
you
so
much
mr
keeling
she
said
i
shall
be
delighted
to
let
you
have
the
block
if
you
feel
like
that
about
it
i
will
bring
it
back
with
me
shall
i
as
he
thought
over
this
when
the
hour
was
quiet
and
upstairs
alice
kept
vigil
norah
s
presence
seemed
to
haunt
the
room
she
had
only
been
here
once
but
he
could
remember
with
such
distinctness
the
trivial
details
of
that
afternoon
that
his
imagination
gave
him
her
again
now
standing
by
the
now
seated
in
one
of
the
chairs
he
had
brought
in
that
day
and
kept
here
since
they
would
be
needed
again
he
hoped
next
sunday
for
with
the
arrival
of
the
leonardo
book
he
had
an
adequate
excuse
for
asking
her
again
and
he
hoped
an
adequate
cause
for
her
acceptance
there
it
lay
on
the
table
still
unopened
and
in
the
clinking
of
the
ashes
in
the
grate
and
the
that
stirred
in
the
bushes
outside
he
heard
with
the
inward
ear
the
sound
of
her
voice
just
a
word
or
two
spoken
through
the
wind
chapter
v
one
night
early
in
december
norah
propert
was
busily
engaged
in
the
of
her
brother
s
house
just
off
the
at
bracebridge
she
had
left
him
over
a
book
and
a
cigarette
in
the
and
as
soon
as
she
had
finished
her
supper
had
gone
across
the
passage
to
her
work
again
the
room
was
very
simply
decorated
to
mrs
keeling
s
eye
it
would
have
seemed
to
be
hardly
decorated
at
all
there
were
a
few
framed
photographs
or
cheap
reproductions
of
famous
pictures
on
the
walls
a
held
some
three
hundred
volumes
the
floor
had
a
drugget
on
it
and
there
was
not
a
square
inch
of
plush
anywhere
the
table
at
which
she
worked
was
covered
with
small
cardboard
slips
bearing
in
her
neat
minute
handwriting
the
titles
and
the
authors
of
the
books
in
mr
keeling
s
library
each
appeared
twice
once
under
its
author
once
under
its
title
and
these
she
was
sorting
out
into
an
alphabetical
file
from
which
she
would
compile
her
catalogue
she
had
been
at
work
on
it
for
about
a
fortnight
and
the
faint
hopes
she
had
originally
entertained
of
getting
it
finished
by
the
end
of
the
year
had
now
completely
vanished
he
had
been
buying
books
in
very
large
numbers
already
had
begun
to
invade
the
floor
space
of
his
room
and
he
intended
in
the
spring
to
build
out
farther
into
the
garden
but
norah
was
not
at
all
sure
that
she
regretted
the
vanishing
of
those
hopes
the
work
interested
her
and
she
had
the
true
s
pride
in
making
all
the
equipment
connected
with
books
as
perfect
as
it
could
be
three
times
a
week
she
went
with
her
brother
after
supper
for
a
couple
of
hours
work
in
mr
keeling
s
library
the
other
evenings
she
brought
into
order
at
home
the
collection
of
slips
she
had
made
there
those
evenings
spent
at
mr
keeling
s
house
had
a
great
attraction
for
her
she
enjoyed
the
work
itself
and
as
she
made
her
slips
she
had
refreshing
glances
at
the
books
it
was
a
leisurely
performance
not
like
her
swift
work
in
the
office
charles
helped
her
in
it
making
or
as
she
made
there
was
a
fire
on
the
hearth
a
tray
of
sandwiches
for
them
before
they
left
and
more
often
than
not
mr
keeling
came
and
sat
with
them
for
half
an
hour
unpacking
fresh
volumes
if
any
had
come
in
and
looking
through
the
that
were
sent
him
and
norah
was
honest
enough
with
herself
to
confess
that
it
was
not
the
work
alone
that
interested
her
friendship
no
less
than
friendship
sudden
and
to
her
quite
unexpected
had
been
the
flower
of
the
original
enmity
between
her
and
the
man
who
was
never
sir
to
her
even
in
the
office
now
it
dated
from
the
moment
when
he
had
made
his
unreserved
apology
to
her
over
the
matter
of
the
she
knew
what
it
must
cost
to
a
man
of
his
type
to
say
what
he
had
said
to
his
typewriter
and
she
had
to
revise
all
her
previous
estimates
of
him
and
add
him
up
honestly
again
she
found
the
total
a
very
different
one
from
that
which
she
had
supposed
was
correct
true
a
woman
does
not
like
or
dislike
a
man
directly
because
of
his
qualities
but
his
qualities
are
the
soil
from
which
her
like
or
dislike
springs
they
are
part
at
any
rate
of
his
personality
in
which
she
finds
charm
or
repulsiveness
the
upshot
was
to
take
it
at
its
smallest
measure
that
instead
of
disliking
her
work
for
him
she
had
grown
to
like
it
because
it
was
for
him
that
she
did
it
she
was
deep
in
her
work
now
when
her
brother
joined
her
charles
was
suffering
from
a
cold
of
paralysing
severity
and
she
looked
up
with
a
certain
anxiety
as
a
fit
of
coughing
took
him
for
he
was
liable
to
bad
bronchitis
charles
you
ought
to
go
to
bed
she
said
and
stop
there
i
dare
say
but
i
shan
t
said
charles
hoarsely
why
it
is
very
unwise
of
you
i
ll
tell
mr
keeling
as
soon
as
i
get
there
in
the
morning
i
m
sure
he
ll
think
you
were
oh
i
shall
be
better
said
he
considering
that
he
saw
me
through
an
illness
last
year
the
least
i
can
do
is
to
hold
on
as
long
as
i
so
that
he
may
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
through
another
one
this
year
remarked
norah
don
t
be
so
optimistic
i
may
die
you
can
if
you
like
she
said
but
it
would
worry
me
very
charles
subsided
into
his
book
again
for
a
little
but
presently
put
it
down
what
about
your
work
at
keeling
s
night
he
said
if
i
m
not
fit
to
come
out
you
can
t
very
well
go
up
there
alone
can
you
norah
paused
before
she
answered
why
on
earth
not
she
said
i
sit
with
him
alone
all
day
in
his
office
besides
i
know
he
has
a
i
shan
t
see
and
how
do
you
know
that
he
asked
because
a
note
came
to
the
office
from
his
wife
which
i
opened
not
knowing
her
writing
which
had
something
to
do
with
it
he
began
dictating
a
reply
for
me
to
but
i
suggested
he
had
better
write
a
note
what
awful
impertinence
he
didn
t
think
so
he
s
rather
touching
he
said
then
you
don
t
despair
of
making
a
gentleman
of
me
in
i
remember
you
told
me
once
he
was
a
cad
i
shall
go
to
bed
i
you
had
much
better
and
do
let
me
tell
him
you
have
stopped
there
morning
she
said
i
doubt
it
i
dare
say
i
shall
be
all
right
charles
was
no
better
next
day
but
merely
obstinate
and
went
up
to
his
work
as
usual
with
his
sister
keeling
appeared
shortly
after
and
as
usual
began
the
dictation
now
and
then
he
gave
sharp
glances
at
norah
and
before
long
stopped
in
the
middle
of
a
letter
what
s
the
matter
miss
propert
he
said
better
tell
me
and
not
waste
time
unless
it
s
he
had
no
difficulty
in
making
her
look
at
him
now
she
looked
up
with
a
half
smile
how
did
you
guess
there
was
anything
the
matter
she
asked
how
do
i
guess
it
is
warm
or
cold
i
feel
it
tell
i
m
rather
anxious
about
charles
she
said
he
has
got
an
appalling
have
you
sent
for
the
doctor
no
he
insisted
on
coming
up
to
his
keeling
got
up
i
ll
soon
settle
that
he
said
going
out
he
came
back
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
you
ll
find
him
in
bed
when
you
get
home
he
said
oh
thank
you
so
much
i
am
so
you
needn
t
be
i
told
him
he
wanted
to
make
me
pay
a
big
doctor
s
bill
for
him
instead
of
his
paying
a
little
one
he
deserved
that
for
being
so
idiotic
as
to
come
out
read
the
letter
please
which
we
stopped
in
the
middle
all
day
the
work
went
forward
as
usual
there
was
a
heavy
budget
to
answer
and
it
was
not
till
nearly
six
that
norah
had
her
letters
ready
for
his
signature
he
made
no
payment
to
her
for
such
work
for
the
balance
was
more
often
on
the
other
side
and
she
got
away
before
her
time
as
he
passed
her
back
the
last
of
the
batch
he
said
you
are
coming
to
the
library
this
evening
are
you
not
i
had
meant
to
if
it
is
convenient
to
perfectly
perhaps
you
would
leave
a
line
on
the
table
to
say
how
your
brother
is
i
don
t
suppose
i
shall
see
you
mrs
keeling
s
party
that
night
which
sat
down
very
punctually
at
seven
and
would
disperse
at
ten
was
of
the
nature
julia
fyson
alice
s
bosom
friend
whom
she
had
begun
to
dislike
very
cordially
was
there
with
her
father
and
mother
the
former
small
and
depressed
the
latter
large
and
and
of
a
thoroughly
poisonous
nature
the
four
keelings
were
there
and
the
extremely
ladylike
young
woman
whom
hugh
had
lately
led
to
the
altar
she
was
a
shade
too
if
anything
and
never
forgot
to
separate
her
little
finger
from
the
others
when
she
was
holding
a
cup
or
glass
they
were
ten
in
all
mr
silverdale
and
dr
inglis
completing
the
number
as
was
usual
at
the
table
of
that
generous
housekeeper
mrs
keeling
there
were
vast
quantities
of
nitrogenous
food
provided
in
many
courses
and
it
was
not
till
nine
that
the
door
was
opened
on
the
run
by
mr
silverdale
to
let
the
ladies
leave
the
room
he
made
a
suitable
remark
to
each
as
she
passed
him
and
julia
fyson
and
alice
with
waists
and
arms
interlaced
stopped
to
talk
to
him
as
they
went
out
precisely
at
that
moment
while
they
were
all
in
the
gothic
hall
together
the
boy
covered
with
buttons
opened
the
front
door
and
admitted
norah
propert
the
door
into
the
was
still
being
held
wide
by
silverdale
as
the
interlaced
young
ladies
answered
his
humorous
laments
over
the
setting
of
the
sun
now
that
the
ladies
were
leaving
and
through
it
keeling
standing
at
the
head
of
the
table
saw
norah
there
she
had
had
but
one
moment
for
thought
as
the
was
opened
to
her
but
the
light
from
the
hall
streamed
full
on
to
the
step
and
she
judged
it
better
to
come
in
than
having
been
already
seen
retreat
again
without
looking
up
she
walked
across
to
the
library
door
while
still
mrs
fyson
stared
and
let
herself
in
she
heard
the
door
opposite
close
again
while
she
fumbled
for
the
switch
of
the
electric
light
she
heard
indistinguishable
murmurs
from
the
hall
only
one
caught
her
ear
intelligibly
when
mrs
keeling
said
oh
mr
keeling
s
typewriter
she
is
cataloguing
his
it
had
begun
to
snow
thickly
outside
and
she
stood
for
a
minute
or
two
before
the
fire
shaking
from
her
cloak
the
frozen
petals
which
fizzed
on
the
coals
certainly
she
had
felt
a
disconcertment
at
the
moment
of
her
entry
and
passage
through
the
hall
had
found
fault
with
the
ill
luck
that
had
caused
her
to
meet
the
gorged
galaxy
from
the
on
the
one
and
only
night
when
her
brother
had
not
been
with
her
but
the
encounter
did
not
long
trouble
her
and
like
warmth
coming
over
frozen
limbs
the
fact
of
being
here
alone
gave
her
a
thrill
of
pleasure
that
surprised
her
she
was
in
his
secret
garden
all
by
herself
without
charles
to
intrude
his
presence
without
even
keeling
himself
she
did
not
want
him
here
now
she
was
surrounded
with
him
and
presently
she
plunged
like
some
ecstatic
diver
into
the
work
she
had
come
to
do
for
him
soon
the
buzz
of
men
s
conversation
drifted
past
the
door
prominent
among
which
was
silverdale
s
expressive
and
voice
and
without
intention
she
found
herself
listening
for
keeling
s
then
the
murmur
was
cut
off
by
the
sound
of
a
shutting
door
and
she
went
on
with
her
work
on
the
catalogue
cards
faint
tinkles
of
a
piano
were
heard
as
alice
performed
several
little
pieces
faint
screams
as
julia
fyson
sang
keeling
was
there
no
doubt
and
still
she
did
not
want
him
in
his
bodily
presence
he
was
more
completely
with
her
in
this
room
empty
but
for
herself
she
had
settled
in
her
own
mind
to
get
away
before
the
party
broke
up
but
she
grew
absorbed
in
her
work
and
it
came
with
something
of
a
surprise
and
shock
to
her
when
again
she
heard
the
gabble
of
mixed
voices
outside
saying
what
a
pleasant
evening
they
had
had
and
realized
that
she
must
wait
till
those
compliments
were
finished
she
had
not
yet
written
the
note
which
keeling
had
asked
her
to
leave
on
the
table
regarding
her
brother
s
health
and
this
she
did
now
as
she
waited
giving
a
promising
account
of
him
soon
the
closed
for
the
last
time
leaving
silence
in
the
hall
and
she
heard
a
foot
cross
it
in
the
direction
of
the
pause
and
then
come
back
keeling
entered
miss
propert
he
said
i
want
you
if
you
will
to
leave
your
work
now
and
come
into
the
to
talk
to
my
wife
and
daughter
for
a
few
minutes
while
i
ring
for
a
cab
for
you
it
is
snowing
oh
i
would
rather
not
do
that
said
norah
i
have
got
great
big
overshoes
there
they
are
filling
up
the
corner
of
the
room
i
shan
t
mind
the
snow
and
mr
keeling
go
back
to
the
and
say
i
ve
it
was
clear
to
each
of
them
that
the
same
situation
that
of
norah
having
been
seen
entering
the
house
alone
after
dinner
and
going
to
his
private
room
was
in
the
mind
of
each
of
them
norah
for
her
part
had
a
secret
blush
for
the
fact
that
she
considered
the
incident
at
all
but
her
reply
had
revealed
that
she
did
for
she
remembered
that
her
brother
had
alluded
to
the
question
of
her
coming
up
here
alone
but
keeling
saw
no
absurdity
in
so
to
speak
regularizing
the
situation
and
his
solution
commended
itself
to
him
more
than
hers
i
should
prefer
that
you
came
and
were
introduced
to
mrs
keeling
he
said
i
think
that
is
norah
got
up
smiling
at
him
her
internal
blush
had
filtered
through
to
her
face
if
you
think
it
best
i
will
she
said
whatever
we
do
don
t
let
us
waste
time
come
then
he
said
he
showed
her
the
way
to
the
where
his
wife
and
alice
were
standing
by
the
fire
i
have
brought
in
miss
propert
he
said
while
i
am
getting
a
cab
for
her
to
take
her
home
it
is
snowing
heavily
and
this
is
my
daughter
miss
mrs
keeling
made
a
great
effort
with
herself
to
behave
as
befitted
a
mayoress
and
the
daughter
of
a
and
captain
she
thought
it
outrageous
of
her
husband
to
have
brought
the
girl
in
here
without
consulting
her
not
being
clever
enough
to
see
the
obvious
wisdom
both
from
his
standpoint
and
that
of
the
girl
of
his
doing
so
but
she
had
the
fairness
to
admit
in
her
own
mind
that
it
was
not
the
girl
s
fault
mr
keeling
had
told
her
to
come
into
the
and
naturally
she
came
therefore
she
behaved
to
her
as
befitted
the
mayoress
talking
to
a
typewriter
and
was
very
grand
and
condescending
i
am
sure
you
are
very
useful
to
mr
keeling
she
said
in
helping
to
arrange
his
books
and
it
must
be
a
great
treat
to
you
to
have
access
to
so
large
a
library
if
you
are
fond
of
the
pretentious
solemnity
of
this
was
not
lost
on
norah
s
sense
of
humour
she
was
rather
annoyed
at
the
whole
affair
but
it
was
absurd
not
to
see
the
lighter
side
of
it
and
answer
accordingly
yes
i
am
very
lucky
she
said
i
was
lucky
in
london
too
where
i
had
access
to
the
library
at
the
british
this
seemed
a
very
proper
speech
to
mrs
keeling
it
was
delivered
in
clear
pleasant
tones
with
the
appearance
of
respect
and
she
could
not
make
out
why
alice
gave
one
of
her
queer
crooked
smiles
or
why
she
said
i
suppose
that
is
bigger
than
my
father
s
miss
norah
looked
up
at
her
laughing
at
a
guess
i
should
say
it
was
she
said
decidedly
there
was
something
here
that
mrs
keeling
did
not
wholly
comprehend
and
when
she
did
not
comprehend
she
called
it
being
kept
in
the
dark
she
comprehended
however
that
norah
was
exceedingly
and
that
there
was
a
certain
air
about
her
which
she
supposed
came
from
reading
books
simultaneously
she
remembered
mrs
fyson
asking
her
who
it
was
who
had
come
in
and
passed
into
mr
keeling
s
library
and
on
being
informed
that
lady
had
said
how
very
odd
and
at
once
changed
the
subject
instantly
she
began
to
consider
if
it
was
very
odd
but
for
the
present
she
determined
that
nothing
should
mar
the
perfect
behaviour
of
the
mayoress
pray
sit
down
miss
propert
she
said
i
fancy
your
brother
is
one
of
mr
keeling
s
clerks
yes
he
usually
comes
with
me
in
the
evening
said
norah
but
he
is
in
bed
with
a
very
bad
indeed
oh
indeed
said
mrs
keeling
conversation
came
to
a
dead
halt
here
and
again
mrs
keeling
with
growing
resentment
took
in
norah
from
head
to
foot
the
seconds
were
beaten
out
sonorously
by
the
pink
clock
on
the
and
at
last
norah
now
growing
thoroughly
uncomfortable
in
this
hostile
atmosphere
rose
i
think
mr
keeling
had
much
better
not
bother
about
a
cab
for
me
she
said
i
can
perfectly
well
walk
mrs
keeling
became
a
shade
statelier
without
abatement
of
her
extremely
proper
behavior
mr
keeling
will
do
as
he
thinks
wisest
about
that
she
said
it
seemed
however
not
to
be
in
mr
keeling
s
power
to
do
what
he
thought
wisest
for
after
a
minute
or
two
of
ringing
silence
he
appeared
with
the
news
that
there
were
no
cabs
to
be
got
it
was
snowing
heavily
and
they
were
all
out
norah
held
out
her
hand
to
mrs
keeling
i
won
t
keep
you
up
any
longer
she
said
i
shall
walk
home
at
it
s
impossible
said
he
there
s
nearly
a
foot
of
snow
all
the
more
reason
for
getting
home
before
there
are
two
said
she
i
ll
see
you
home
then
he
said
you
can
t
go
indeed
you
shall
do
nothing
of
the
sort
said
she
it
is
quite
unnecessary
i
absolutely
forbid
for
a
moment
it
was
a
mere
tussle
of
will
between
them
and
norah
s
reasons
were
the
stronger
she
looked
at
him
a
moment
and
knew
she
had
won
and
without
more
words
went
back
to
the
library
and
put
on
her
and
gathered
up
the
she
had
made
that
evening
he
followed
her
as
far
as
the
hall
and
waited
for
her
don
t
look
at
my
feet
she
said
gaily
they
are
officially
invisible
like
the
legs
of
the
queen
of
the
grim
mouth
smiled
and
the
stern
eyes
grew
kindly
she
knew
that
transformation
so
well
now
you
are
very
obstinate
he
said
why
don
t
you
let
me
walk
home
with
you
i
am
right
she
said
and
i
think
your
plan
was
they
weren
t
rude
to
you
he
asked
growing
grim
again
ah
you
shouldn
t
have
asked
that
she
said
they
were
exceedingly
he
let
her
out
into
the
snow
and
felt
that
fire
went
with
her
then
returned
to
the
where
he
found
unquestionable
ice
little
sour
wreaths
of
mist
were
already
afloat
in
mrs
keeling
s
mind
which
though
not
yet
condensed
into
actual
thought
were
chilling
down
to
it
in
that
narrow
receptacle
alice
took
her
embroidery
and
went
upstairs
but
his
wife
sat
rather
upright
by
the
fire
looking
at
the
evening
paper
which
she
held
upside
down
she
meant
to
behave
with
perfect
propriety
again
but
wished
him
to
begin
so
as
to
launch
her
propriety
on
a
fair
and
even
keel
for
his
part
he
had
known
so
many
of
those
evenings
when
the
went
away
precisely
at
ten
and
he
was
left
to
hear
long
comments
by
his
wife
on
the
soup
and
the
beef
and
the
grouse
and
the
pudding
and
the
savoury
and
what
dr
inglis
said
and
what
mrs
fyson
thought
he
hoped
when
he
first
came
back
after
seeing
norah
fade
into
the
that
he
was
to
be
regaled
with
such
reminiscences
but
hoped
rather
against
hope
no
reminiscences
came
to
his
aid
and
he
began
to
be
aware
from
the
conditions
that
he
must
expect
something
far
less
jovial
and
trivial
but
he
had
no
accusing
conscience
and
if
she
chose
to
read
her
evening
paper
upside
down
in
silence
he
could
at
least
read
the
morning
paper
the
right
way
up
then
as
he
would
not
give
her
a
lead
make
some
remark
that
is
to
say
to
which
she
could
take
exception
she
had
to
begin
i
must
say
i
am
surprised
at
your
not
seeing
miss
propert
home
she
said
after
bringing
her
into
my
and
forcing
me
to
be
civil
to
her
you
might
have
had
the
civility
yourself
to
see
her
to
her
he
was
aware
that
she
was
intending
to
exercise
the
somewhere
it
was
not
many
weeks
ago
that
she
had
brought
it
into
play
regarding
mr
silverdale
and
his
romish
practices
when
she
had
refused
to
leave
his
church
for
the
simpler
rites
of
the
cathedral
he
had
yielded
there
because
he
did
not
really
care
whether
she
and
alice
chose
to
attend
a
or
not
they
might
if
they
liked
it
did
not
seriously
matter
but
the
if
she
was
intending
to
exercise
it
over
the
question
of
norah
mattered
very
much
would
it
have
pleased
you
better
if
i
had
seen
her
home
he
asked
i
can
t
say
whether
i
should
have
been
pleased
or
not
she
said
it
didn
t
happen
but
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
why
you
sent
your
typewriter
in
here
to
talk
to
me
i
don
t
know
what
you
think
i
should
find
to
say
to
her
with
alice
here
she
had
said
too
much
and
knew
it
the
moment
she
had
said
it
but
the
mists
had
congealed
and
she
felt
obliged
as
she
would
have
expressed
it
say
to
mrs
fyson
to
speak
her
mind
she
did
not
really
speak
her
mind
she
spoke
what
some
perfectly
groundless
jealousy
dictated
to
her
he
dropped
the
paper
and
stood
up
by
the
fireplace
you
said
with
alice
here
too
he
said
oblige
me
by
telling
me
what
you
she
saw
that
in
a
reasonable
frame
of
mind
she
would
not
have
meant
anything
but
she
was
cross
and
surfeited
and
the
cold
in
the
head
which
had
spared
her
so
long
was
seriously
threatening
she
wanted
out
of
sheer
perverseness
to
defend
an
indefensible
position
well
i
m
sure
alice
must
have
thought
it
very
odd
your
bringing
your
typewriter
into
my
she
said
no
you
didn
t
mean
that
said
keeling
mrs
keeling
got
up
if
you
only
want
to
contradict
me
she
said
you
can
do
it
by
yourself
thomas
i
m
not
going
to
answer
you
that
rude
girl
came
in
here
rude
you
said
how
was
she
rude
he
knew
he
was
being
unwise
in
bandying
stupid
words
with
his
wife
but
she
continued
to
make
accusations
and
his
want
of
breeding
to
use
a
general
term
did
not
allow
him
to
pass
them
over
in
the
silence
that
he
knew
they
deserved
how
was
she
rude
he
repeated
she
said
something
about
the
british
museum
library
that
i
did
not
understand
she
said
and
because
you
couldn
t
understand
you
think
she
was
rude
was
that
it
well
if
you
had
heard
her
say
it
she
began
you
know
i
did
not
but
i
am
quite
certain
that
miss
propert
was
not
rude
and
now
about
alice
s
being
here
when
i
brought
her
in
what
of
that
i
wish
you
to
tell
me
if
you
meant
anything
if
you
did
not
i
wish
you
to
say
he
knew
quite
well
that
he
was
adopting
a
bullying
tone
but
he
had
no
inclination
to
be
bullied
himself
one
or
other
of
them
had
to
be
vanquished
over
this
and
he
was
quite
determined
that
he
would
not
hold
the
white
flag
there
was
something
to
be
fought
for
something
which
he
could
not
give
up
you
must
allow
it
was
very
odd
that
your
secretary
should
appear
in
the
middle
of
my
she
said
and
simply
stroll
across
to
your
room
i
had
been
talking
of
your
room
half
with
mr
fyson
saying
that
none
of
us
was
allowed
there
and
then
in
came
this
girl
he
cut
her
short
what
has
that
to
do
with
alice
he
repeated
i
was
going
to
say
that
only
you
always
interrupt
me
she
said
then
when
our
guests
are
gone
you
bring
her
in
here
just
as
if
she
was
julia
fyson
into
my
and
alice
well
alice
would
think
it
very
odd
too
just
as
mrs
fyson
did
of
course
it
was
not
that
which
mrs
fyson
thought
odd
i
know
you
will
try
to
catch
me
up
and
ask
me
how
mrs
fyson
knew
but
that
is
always
your
way
thomas
i
know
quite
well
that
mrs
fyson
had
gone
away
before
you
brought
her
in
i
don
t
want
to
catch
you
up
he
said
i
only
want
to
know
why
alice
should
not
be
here
when
i
bring
miss
propert
in
to
wait
for
a
cab
you
can
t
give
me
any
reason
because
there
is
no
reason
let
s
get
that
clear
and
then
i
want
to
talk
about
something
suddenly
the
whole
of
the
vague
internal
movements
of
her
mind
flashed
into
his
vision
as
intelligible
as
some
perfectly
simple
business
proposition
she
had
a
certain
justification
too
it
was
awkward
that
norah
had
run
into
the
exit
of
the
ladies
that
his
wife
had
been
saying
that
none
of
them
ever
entered
the
library
he
knew
the
mind
of
bracebridge
pretty
well
the
slightly
malicious
construction
that
women
like
mrs
fyson
would
find
themselves
compelled
to
put
on
it
all
he
knew
also
the
mind
of
his
wife
and
the
effect
which
it
clearly
had
had
on
her
her
sense
of
propriety
of
dignity
had
been
assaulted
it
was
a
queer
thing
to
have
happened
then
there
was
norah
s
presence
in
her
he
had
insisted
on
that
for
at
the
moment
it
seemed
the
most
straightforward
thing
to
do
but
he
was
beginning
to
think
it
had
been
a
mistake
something
about
the
girl
her
beauty
and
never
had
that
struck
him
so
forcibly
as
when
he
saw
her
standing
by
alice
her
air
of
breeding
of
education
of
simplicity
in
front
of
those
draped
easels
and
painted
had
stirred
some
long
latent
potentiality
for
jealousy
in
his
wife
it
was
that
suggestion
which
suddenly
enraged
him
don
t
be
such
a
damned
fool
emmeline
he
said
angrily
answering
his
own
thoughts
he
had
divined
hers
quite
correctly
and
the
justice
that
lay
behind
this
rude
speech
struck
her
full
her
only
course
was
to
take
refuge
in
her
own
propriety
knew
how
to
behave
well
mr
keeling
she
said
you
can
t
expect
me
to
say
anything
more
about
it
if
all
you
want
to
do
is
to
swear
at
me
perhaps
you
would
like
to
swear
at
me
again
pray
no
that
s
all
he
said
i
ve
told
you
not
to
be
a
damned
fool
and
i
meant
it
the
wisest
thing
you
can
do
is
to
take
my
she
moistened
her
lips
very
genteelly
with
the
tip
of
her
tongue
then
if
you
have
finished
with
that
she
said
shall
we
pass
on
to
the
other
matter
you
said
you
wanted
to
talk
to
me
by
all
means
your
mr
silverdale
is
stuffing
alice
s
head
with
ridiculous
notions
he
s
doing
the
same
to
that
other
girl
of
course
she
s
no
business
of
yours
or
mine
but
alice
is
she
ll
soon
be
fancying
herself
in
love
with
him
if
she
doesn
t
and
do
you
want
my
opinion
on
the
subject
asked
the
mayoress
of
course
i
am
consulting
then
i
think
you
are
quite
mistaken
they
are
great
friends
and
mr
silverdale
has
the
most
wonderful
and
spiritual
influence
over
her
she
is
quite
changed
she
is
always
doing
something
now
for
somebody
else
she
reads
to
mamma
she
takes
a
sunday
school
she
is
busy
and
happy
mr
keeling
considered
this
my
idea
is
that
she
s
doing
it
all
for
mr
silverdale
she
could
have
read
to
your
mother
before
dr
inglis
went
to
the
cathedral
silverdale
is
the
somebody
she
s
doing
things
it
is
due
to
his
influence
certainly
i
know
you
dislike
him
but
then
that
is
your
opinion
and
it
does
not
agree
with
other
people
s
his
parishioners
generally
adore
especially
the
young
ladies
and
of
these
especially
the
silly
ones
he
can
have
an
influence
with
my
poor
alice
without
holding
her
hand
and
whispering
to
her
he
s
a
flirt
and
i
don
t
like
flirts
especially
those
who
wrap
up
their
nonsense
in
religion
can
t
you
do
something
to
stop
it
he
s
always
coming
here
isn
t
he
i
don
t
like
all
that
pawing
and
touching
and
saying
it
is
spiritual
mrs
keeling
felt
shocked
at
this
positively
carnal
view
of
mr
silverdale
s
tendernesses
at
the
same
time
she
thought
they
had
a
promising
aspect
besides
the
spiritual
one
well
i
hope
you
ll
not
say
or
do
anything
to
put
him
off
she
said
the
practical
side
of
the
question
claiming
her
i
m
sure
it
s
high
time
alice
was
married
and
never
yet
has
she
taken
to
a
young
man
as
she
s
taken
to
mr
poor
keeling
s
head
whirled
a
moment
ago
his
wife
had
said
that
the
two
were
great
friends
only
on
the
spiritual
plane
now
she
was
saying
precisely
what
she
had
begun
by
contradicting
he
was
satisfied
however
that
he
had
her
true
opinion
at
last
it
did
not
appear
to
him
to
be
worth
anything
but
there
it
was
he
got
up
if
i
thought
silverdale
had
the
slightest
intention
of
marrying
alice
he
said
i
shouldn
t
mind
how
much
he
pawed
her
but
i
don
t
believe
he
has
i
ve
a
good
mind
to
ask
indeed
i
hope
you
will
do
nothing
so
indelicate
said
she
a
humorous
twinkle
came
into
his
eye
i
wish
you
would
flirt
with
him
yourself
emmeline
he
said
and
take
him
away
from
alice
perhaps
you
do
some
of
these
clergy
flirt
with
every
woman
within
reach
and
you
re
twice
as
handsome
as
this
also
was
dreadfully
indelicate
but
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
mrs
keeling
cast
a
glance
into
the
looking
glass
where
her
reflection
looked
out
like
a
naiad
amid
the
even
while
she
reproved
her
husband
for
the
broadness
of
his
suggestion
i
never
heard
of
such
talk
said
she
pray
don
t
let
us
have
any
more
of
it
for
shame
but
she
went
up
to
her
bed
in
a
far
better
temper
than
she
would
otherwise
have
done
and
quite
abandoned
any
idea
of
lying
awake
to
punish
him
for
his
previous
brutality
he
went
back
to
his
library
when
his
wife
left
him
where
an
intangible
something
of
norah
s
presence
lingered
there
was
the
chair
she
had
sat
in
there
was
her
note
to
him
about
her
brother
on
the
table
and
the
blotting
paper
on
which
she
had
blotted
the
entries
she
had
made
on
the
catalogue
cards
he
took
up
the
top
sheet
and
held
it
to
the
light
so
as
to
be
able
to
read
the
titles
of
the
books
there
were
the
authors
names
in
big
firm
capitals
the
in
smaller
writing
but
legible
she
had
done
a
lot
for
he
remembered
having
put
clean
blotting
paper
for
her
and
the
sheet
was
covered
with
impressions
here
she
had
been
sitting
at
work
while
he
talked
and
listened
to
those
people
in
the
who
meant
nothing
to
him
he
laid
the
sheet
down
with
an
impatient
exclamation
at
himself
and
thought
over
the
incident
of
norah
s
meeting
the
party
of
ladies
in
the
hall
mrs
fyson
had
thought
it
odd
had
she
so
much
the
more
mistaken
was
mrs
fyson
there
was
nothing
odd
about
it
at
all
his
wife
had
been
disposed
to
take
mrs
fyson
s
view
and
he
had
given
her
his
opinion
on
that
point
pretty
sharply
nothing
had
ever
passed
between
norah
and
himself
that
might
not
with
perfect
propriety
have
taken
place
in
the
middle
of
the
with
mrs
fyson
and
all
the
ladies
of
bracebridge
straining
their
eyes
and
ears
to
detect
anything
which
could
have
given
one
of
them
a
single
thing
to
think
about
but
the
complete
truth
of
that
was
not
the
whole
truth
a
situation
which
was
in
process
of
formation
underlay
that
truth
and
just
now
that
situation
had
expressed
itself
in
eloquent
silence
when
he
took
up
the
and
read
what
norah
had
written
on
the
cards
he
had
not
given
a
thought
to
the
titles
of
the
books
and
their
authors
though
probably
his
eyes
had
observed
them
his
mind
had
been
wholly
occupied
with
the
knowledge
that
it
was
she
who
had
written
them
it
was
that
which
his
wife
had
expressed
in
her
manner
and
her
words
it
was
that
for
which
he
had
chosen
to
swear
at
her
he
had
given
her
a
good
knock
for
hinting
at
it
and
had
followed
up
that
knock
by
the
stupid
sort
of
joke
about
the
superiority
of
her
charms
to
those
of
alice
which
she
was
sure
to
appreciate
she
had
done
so
she
had
said
for
shame
and
gone
simpering
to
bed
perhaps
that
would
take
her
mind
off
the
other
affair
he
sincerely
hoped
it
would
but
he
distrusted
her
stupidity
a
cleverer
woman
would
have
probably
accepted
the
more
superficial
truth
that
there
had
never
passed
between
him
and
norah
a
single
intimate
word
but
a
stupid
one
might
easily
let
a
dull
unfounded
suspicion
take
root
in
her
mind
it
was
difficult
to
deal
with
stupid
people
you
never
knew
where
their
stupidity
might
break
out
next
emmeline
had
a
certain
power
of
sticking
and
mrs
fyson
had
a
brilliant
imagination
together
they
might
evolve
some
odious
one
that
would
fumble
and
shove
its
way
into
the
underlying
truth
he
got
up
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
there
was
no
use
in
making
conjectures
about
it
all
perhaps
if
he
gave
emmeline
a
for
her
birthday
which
fortunately
occurred
next
week
he
could
distract
her
mind
but
it
was
impossible
to
tell
about
emmeline
her
stupidity
was
an
incalculable
item
he
went
to
the
front
door
in
order
to
make
sure
he
had
put
the
chain
on
and
then
taking
it
off
opened
the
door
and
looked
out
into
the
night
the
snow
was
still
falling
fast
and
the
prints
of
wheels
and
footsteps
outside
were
already
obliterated
mr
silverdale
had
walked
home
predicting
a
jolly
good
snowballing
match
with
his
boys
next
day
and
keeling
found
himself
detesting
mr
silverdale
with
acute
intensity
norah
had
walked
home
also
in
a
moment
he
was
back
in
the
hall
putting
on
a
mackintosh
he
would
have
liked
to
put
on
boots
as
well
but
for
that
he
would
have
had
to
go
up
to
his
next
door
to
his
wife
s
bedroom
then
gently
closing
the
door
behind
him
he
went
out
into
the
night
he
must
just
walk
as
far
as
her
house
to
make
sure
she
was
not
still
tramping
her
way
through
the
snow
and
traverse
the
streets
she
had
traversed
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
satisfy
himself
about
that
and
he
did
not
care
how
unreasonable
it
was
rational
considerations
had
no
application
an
emotional
dictate
made
him
go
there
was
but
a
mile
of
thoroughfare
between
his
house
and
hers
but
he
striving
to
smother
the
emotion
he
would
not
admit
told
himself
that
he
must
be
satisfied
she
was
not
still
out
in
this
frozen
inclement
night
he
gave
that
as
a
sop
to
his
rational
self
but
he
knew
he
threw
it
as
to
some
caged
wolf
to
keep
it
from
growling
there
was
a
moon
somewhere
above
the
that
already
were
beginning
to
grow
thin
from
the
burden
they
had
discharged
and
the
smug
villas
on
each
side
of
the
road
were
clearly
visible
she
had
to
go
up
the
length
of
alfred
road
then
turn
down
the
street
that
led
by
st
thomas
s
vicarage
and
emerge
into
west
street
where
she
lived
with
her
brother
already
a
fortnight
ago
he
had
ascertained
the
number
of
their
house
not
asking
for
it
directly
but
causing
her
to
volunteer
the
information
and
since
then
he
had
half
a
dozen
times
gone
through
the
street
on
his
way
to
and
from
the
stores
in
order
to
take
a
glance
at
it
as
he
passed
he
had
wanted
to
know
what
the
house
looked
like
he
had
wanted
to
construct
the
circumstances
of
her
life
to
know
the
aspect
of
her
environment
to
see
the
out
of
which
she
came
to
her
duties
as
his
secretary
that
all
concerned
her
and
for
that
reason
it
concerned
him
he
knew
the
house
well
by
now
he
knew
from
chance
remarks
that
he
had
angled
for
that
her
bedroom
looked
into
the
street
that
charles
s
looked
on
to
an
old
disused
graveyard
behind
there
was
the
and
the
in
front
and
a
paling
behind
which
michaelmas
daisies
flourished
in
a
thin
row
she
cared
for
flowers
but
not
for
flowers
in
a
bed
they
rather
provoked
her
they
were
playing
at
being
flowers
she
liked
them
when
they
grew
in
wild
woodland
spaces
and
were
not
confined
between
a
and
a
row
of
tiled
path
the
empty
streets
dumb
with
snow
flitted
silently
by
him
and
as
they
passed
he
seemed
to
himself
to
be
standing
still
while
some
circular
movement
of
the
earth
carried
him
past
the
silly
vicarage
and
into
west
street
it
brought
him
up
to
the
house
it
showed
him
a
red
blind
on
the
first
floor
lit
from
within
that
was
what
he
had
come
to
see
and
he
waited
a
moment
on
the
white
pavement
opposite
watching
it
she
had
got
home
that
was
all
right
then
yet
still
he
looked
at
the
blind
he
turned
and
retraced
his
steps
now
that
the
object
of
his
expedition
was
secured
he
was
conscious
of
all
the
discomforts
and
absurdity
of
what
he
had
been
doing
the
snow
was
deep
his
evening
shoes
were
wet
through
his
mackintosh
heavy
with
clinging
flakes
and
his
rational
self
made
its
voice
heard
telling
him
what
a
fool
s
errand
was
in
progress
he
heard
but
his
emotional
self
heeded
nothing
of
that
it
would
not
argue
it
would
not
answer
it
was
well
satisfied
with
what
he
had
done
telling
him
now
that
he
was
going
homewards
again
that
he
would
find
there
the
blotting
paper
on
which
she
had
pressed
the
wet
ink
of
her
catalogue
slips
reminding
him
that
at
nine
next
morning
he
would
see
her
again
it
would
attend
to
no
interruptions
its
thoughts
sufficed
for
itself
but
he
knew
that
his
reason
his
prudence
were
ringing
him
up
as
it
were
on
the
telephone
the
bell
tinkled
with
repeated
calls
for
him
to
listen
to
what
they
had
to
say
but
he
refused
to
take
the
receiver
down
he
would
not
give
his
ear
to
their
coherent
message
and
let
them
go
on
summoning
him
unheeded
he
knew
all
they
had
to
say
and
did
not
want
to
hear
it
again
they
took
an
altogether
exaggerated
view
of
his
affairs
when
they
told
him
that
the
situation
might
easily
develop
into
a
dangerous
one
he
with
his
emotional
self
to
back
him
up
knew
better
than
they
and
had
assured
them
that
his
had
the
situation
well
in
hand
they
need
not
go
on
summoning
him
he
was
not
going
to
attend
in
the
leafless
elms
above
there
sang
in
this
wintry
and
night
the
shy
strong
bird
of
romance
never
in
his
life
had
he
heard
such
rapture
of
melody
despite
his
fifty
years
and
the
hard
dry
business
atmosphere
of
his
life
there
was
something
amazingly
boyish
in
the
inward
agitation
in
which
keeling
arriving
ten
minutes
before
his
time
at
his
office
next
morning
awaited
norah
s
coming
his
midnight
excursion
dictated
by
some
imperative
necessity
from
within
had
even
if
it
was
not
a
new
stage
in
his
emotional
history
revealed
a
chapter
already
written
but
not
yet
read
by
him
he
expected
too
quite
irrationally
that
some
corresponding
illumination
must
have
come
to
the
girl
that
she
like
himself
must
have
progressed
along
a
similar
stage
he
pictured
himself
telling
her
how
he
had
left
his
house
in
order
to
have
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
her
lit
window
he
had
a
humorous
word
to
say
about
the
state
of
his
dress
shoes
in
place
of
which
he
must
not
forget
to
order
a
pair
from
the
boot
and
shoe
department
this
morning
he
could
see
her
smile
with
eyes
and
mouth
in
answer
to
his
youthful
confession
as
she
always
smiled
when
as
often
happened
now
some
small
mutual
understanding
flitted
to
and
fro
between
them
and
could
easily
imagine
the
tone
of
her
reply
oh
but
how
dreadfully
foolish
of
you
mr
keeling
you
want
to
be
laid
up
too
like
she
would
not
say
more
than
that
but
there
would
be
that
glimmer
of
comprehension
of
acceptance
that
showed
she
had
some
share
in
the
adventure
that
she
allowed
it
looked
on
it
with
the
kind
eye
of
a
friend
there
was
never
a
swifter
disillusionment
than
when
she
came
in
and
he
stood
up
as
he
had
now
learned
to
do
at
her
entrance
he
had
heard
her
step
along
the
passage
and
the
bird
of
romance
hidden
perhaps
behind
the
sofa
or
in
the
case
of
files
gave
out
a
great
jubilant
throatful
of
song
but
next
moment
it
was
as
if
some
hand
mrs
fyson
s
perhaps
had
wrung
its
neck
and
stopped
its
singing
she
had
a
perfectly
friendly
smile
for
him
but
the
smile
was
not
one
shade
more
friendly
than
usual
her
eyes
did
not
hold
lit
within
them
a
spark
of
closer
intimacy
than
had
habitually
been
there
for
the
last
fortnight
whatever
had
happened
to
him
last
night
he
saw
that
nothing
whatever
had
happened
to
her
no
sixth
sense
had
conveyed
to
her
the
smallest
hint
of
his
midnight
walk
she
had
been
through
no
nocturnal
experiences
that
the
most
sanguine
could
construe
into
correspondence
with
that
and
on
the
moment
he
could
no
more
have
told
her
about
his
midnight
walk
or
have
been
humorous
on
the
subject
of
disintegrated
shoes
than
he
could
have
taken
her
into
his
arms
and
kissed
her
and
by
the
standard
of
how
incredibly
remote
she
seemed
he
could
judge
of
the
distance
of
his
spirit
s
leap
towards
her
when
he
stood
outside
her
window
last
night
the
very
absence
of
any
change
in
her
was
the
light
by
which
he
saw
the
change
in
himself
she
had
his
letters
opened
for
him
with
her
usual
speed
but
as
she
worked
he
could
see
by
the
soft
creased
line
between
her
eyebrows
even
as
he
had
seen
it
yesterday
morning
when
she
was
anxious
about
her
brother
that
something
troubled
her
however
he
did
not
question
her
she
might
tell
him
if
she
felt
disposed
and
guessing
that
it
was
connected
with
the
events
of
last
night
his
instinct
told
him
that
it
was
for
her
to
speak
or
be
silent
then
when
she
had
opened
the
letters
she
placed
them
by
him
and
without
a
word
took
up
her
and
pencil
for
the
shorthand
dictation
but
still
her
brow
did
not
clear
the
smudge
of
shadow
lay
perpendicularly
between
her
as
fixed
as
if
it
was
some
soft
pencil
mark
on
the
skin
the
work
was
not
heavy
and
nearly
an
hour
before
the
interval
for
lunch
he
had
finished
the
dictation
of
his
answers
she
knew
his
business
engagements
as
well
as
himself
and
reminding
him
that
a
was
coming
to
see
him
at
twelve
on
some
private
matter
took
her
papers
into
the
little
inner
room
then
she
came
back
for
her
typewriter
which
stood
on
the
table
in
the
window
where
she
usually
worked
paused
and
came
over
to
his
table
may
i
speak
to
you
a
moment
she
asked
certainly
miss
propert
what
is
it
she
fingered
the
edge
of
the
table
and
with
her
instinct
for
tidiness
put
straight
a
couple
of
papers
that
lay
there
it
s
about
last
night
she
said
i
told
charles
what
had
happened
and
he
doesn
t
want
me
to
come
up
to
your
house
again
like
that
in
the
evening
he
knows
as
well
as
i
do
she
broke
off
and
the
trouble
cleared
from
her
face
as
she
looked
up
at
him
smiling
charles
wanted
to
write
to
you
she
said
but
i
said
i
would
really
prefer
to
explain
people
are
such
fools
you
know
aren
t
they
there
was
mingled
chagrin
and
pleasure
for
him
in
this
speech
he
admired
the
frank
friendliness
with
which
she
spoke
but
he
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
in
her
some
consciousness
of
the
underlying
truth
which
last
night
he
had
hugged
to
himself
but
in
her
frankness
there
seemed
to
be
a
complete
unconsciousness
of
any
of
his
own
sentiments
no
twitter
however
remote
of
the
bird
of
romance
that
had
sung
to
him
from
the
snowy
trees
he
assented
to
the
fact
that
people
were
fools
but
is
that
the
end
of
my
library
catalogue
he
asked
no
i
must
finish
it
i
thought
perhaps
i
could
go
there
for
an
hour
in
the
middle
of
the
morning
when
you
were
down
here
i
could
still
get
your
letters
done
in
time
for
the
evening
post
if
i
went
there
every
day
for
an
hour
i
could
get
through
as
much
as
i
did
on
alternate
he
knew
this
to
be
a
sound
and
sensible
plan
but
he
did
not
in
the
least
wish
to
assent
to
it
in
the
first
place
it
would
look
as
if
he
acknowledged
some
basis
of
reason
in
his
wife
s
attitude
the
evening
before
in
the
second
place
he
would
no
longer
have
those
after
dinner
in
his
library
with
norah
and
her
brother
he
knew
that
they
had
become
the
pearl
of
the
day
to
him
but
since
people
are
such
fools
he
said
does
it
matter
yes
i
think
it
does
i
don
t
want
to
make
for
me
he
asked
you
make
she
flushed
a
little
yes
personally
i
don
t
care
two
straws
but
charles
does
keeling
stood
up
i
m
ashamed
of
myself
he
said
your
brother
is
perfectly
right
go
down
then
as
you
suggest
in
the
we
ll
settle
it
like
that
then
she
said
but
i
am
so
sorry
i
liked
those
i
didn
t
object
to
them
myself
said
he
as
she
turned
their
eyes
met
again
and
norah
knew
she
had
done
right
but
that
knowledge
gave
her
no
atom
of
satisfaction
the
was
announced
and
norah
left
the
two
together
of
late
years
keeling
had
been
buying
both
and
houses
in
bracebridge
and
simpson
his
agent
had
been
instructed
to
inform
him
of
any
desirable
site
that
was
coming
into
the
market
but
at
the
moment
he
felt
singularly
little
interested
in
any
purchase
that
simpson
might
recommend
simpson
he
said
what
have
you
come
about
in
the
next
room
the
typing
machine
had
begun
its
clacking
that
came
staccato
and
subdued
through
the
door
that
seemed
to
him
more
momentous
than
anything
his
agent
could
tell
him
about
well
sir
there
s
a
building
site
just
beyond
your
little
place
began
mr
simpson
it
s
coming
up
next
month
for
sale
but
if
you
make
an
offer
now
i
think
you
might
get
it
keeling
forced
his
mind
away
from
the
sound
that
came
from
next
door
and
looked
at
the
map
that
the
agent
had
spread
out
but
the
purchase
did
not
appeal
to
him
too
far
out
he
said
and
i
think
the
is
being
a
bit
overdone
anything
else
he
said
yes
sir
if
you
ll
pay
the
price
there
s
an
important
site
which
the
owner
wants
to
sell
the
freehold
of
it
s
the
site
of
the
county
club
the
price
asked
seems
rather
high
but
then
i
consider
the
club
are
getting
their
premises
absurdly
cheap
you
might
fairly
ask
a
much
higher
suddenly
keeling
felt
himself
interested
in
this
and
the
clacking
of
the
typewriter
came
to
his
ears
no
longer
what
lease
has
the
club
got
he
asked
i
have
ascertained
that
there
is
a
break
in
it
next
midsummer
on
both
sides
notice
to
be
given
at
lady
day
the
present
owner
had
determined
to
put
up
their
rent
then
and
the
committee
i
believe
thought
that
quite
reasonable
but
he
wants
cash
and
has
instructed
me
to
look
out
for
a
keeling
had
that
faculty
which
had
stood
him
in
such
good
stead
all
his
life
of
being
able
to
make
up
his
mind
quickly
when
all
the
data
were
put
before
him
he
did
not
hesitate
now
and
ten
minutes
after
when
the
details
of
the
ownership
and
present
lease
were
in
his
possession
he
had
authorised
his
agent
to
purchase
for
him
i
gather
that
the
owner
wishes
the
transaction
to
be
private
he
said
and
i
wish
the
certainly
i
think
you
have
made
a
wise
purchase
sir
said
simpson
i
am
told
that
the
landlord
is
a
member
of
the
club
sir
i
will
have
the
deed
made
out
with
your
lawyer
without
keeling
nodded
the
last
speech
had
given
him
something
to
think
about
chapter
vi
mrs
keeling
had
much
enjoyed
the
sense
of
added
pomp
and
dignity
which
her
husband
s
mayoralty
gave
her
she
liked
seeing
placards
in
the
streets
that
a
concert
in
aid
of
some
charity
was
given
under
the
patronage
of
the
lady
mayoress
and
would
rustle
into
the
reserved
for
her
in
the
middle
of
the
with
the
feeling
that
she
had
got
this
concert
up
and
was
responsible
not
only
for
the
assistance
it
gave
to
the
charity
in
question
but
for
the
excellence
of
the
performance
she
assumed
a
grander
and
more
condescending
air
at
her
parties
and
distinctly
began
to
unbend
to
the
inhabitants
of
alfred
road
instead
of
associating
with
them
as
equals
she
knew
her
position
as
lady
mayoress
it
almost
seemed
to
her
that
it
was
she
who
had
raised
her
husband
to
the
civic
dignity
and
when
one
morning
she
found
among
her
letters
an
invitation
from
lady
inverbroom
for
herself
and
him
to
dine
and
sleep
one
day
early
in
december
at
their
place
a
few
miles
outside
bracebridge
she
was
easily
able
to
see
through
the
insincerity
of
lady
inverbroom
s
adding
that
it
would
give
her
husband
such
pleasure
to
show
mr
keeling
his
library
it
was
an
amiable
insincerity
but
emmeline
was
secretly
sure
that
the
lady
mayoress
was
the
desired
guest
she
tried
without
success
to
control
the
trembling
of
her
voice
when
she
telephoned
to
keeling
who
had
just
left
for
the
stores
those
vulgar
stores
the
gratifying
request
he
was
quite
pleased
to
accept
it
but
she
could
detect
no
trembling
in
his
voice
but
men
controlled
their
feelings
better
than
women
she
took
the
as
her
maid
though
her
husband
altogether
refused
to
pass
off
the
boy
covered
with
buttons
as
his
valet
and
enjoyed
a
moment
s
supreme
triumph
when
she
was
able
to
reply
to
lady
inverbroom
who
hoped
when
she
showed
her
her
room
that
she
would
ask
the
for
anything
she
required
that
she
had
brought
her
own
maid
then
lady
inverbroom
to
hide
her
natural
confusion
had
poked
the
fire
for
her
and
pointed
out
the
position
of
the
bathroom
which
communicated
with
her
bedroom
certainly
that
was
most
convenient
and
dinner
would
be
at
eight
mrs
keeling
felt
a
little
strange
the
magnificence
of
this
great
house
rather
overawed
her
and
she
had
to
remind
herself
several
times
as
she
dressed
that
she
was
lady
mayoress
there
were
quantities
of
tall
liveried
footmen
standing
about
when
she
went
down
but
she
remembered
to
put
her
nose
in
the
air
to
about
the
angle
at
which
lady
inverbroom
s
nose
was
naturally
levelled
and
walked
by
them
with
an
unseeing
eye
as
if
they
were
pieces
of
familiar
furniture
she
had
soup
on
a
silver
plate
and
was
quite
successful
in
avoiding
what
she
would
have
called
a
scroopy
noise
made
with
her
spoon
as
she
fed
herself
off
that
unusual
material
then
when
lord
inverbroom
alluded
casually
to
the
great
reynolds
over
the
chimney
piece
she
flattered
herself
that
she
made
a
very
apposite
remark
when
after
duly
admiring
it
she
said
and
who
is
the
heir
to
all
this
beautiful
property
for
she
was
well
aware
that
her
hosts
were
childless
there
were
no
guests
in
the
house
except
themselves
and
though
it
would
have
been
nice
to
let
slip
the
names
of
illustrious
people
when
alluding
to
this
visit
afterwards
in
bracebridge
she
felt
glad
at
the
time
that
there
was
no
one
else
for
she
was
on
the
verge
of
feeling
shy
which
would
never
have
done
for
a
lady
mayoress
a
few
small
incidents
during
dinner
rather
surprised
her
once
lady
inverbroom
in
helping
herself
to
some
hot
sauce
let
a
drop
of
it
fall
on
the
fingers
of
the
footman
who
handed
it
to
her
instantly
she
turned
round
in
her
chair
and
said
in
a
voice
of
real
concern
just
as
if
the
man
had
not
been
a
piece
of
furniture
i
beg
your
pardon
i
hope
i
didn
t
burn
you
after
dinner
again
when
cigarettes
came
round
she
was
rather
astonished
at
being
offered
one
and
holding
her
head
very
high
turned
abruptly
away
no
doubt
it
was
a
mistake
but
there
would
have
been
words
at
the
cedars
next
morning
if
the
had
offered
a
cigarette
to
any
lady
indeed
she
was
rather
astonished
that
lord
inverbroom
lit
his
without
first
asking
her
if
she
minded
the
perfume
but
what
surprised
her
even
more
than
her
hostess
s
politeness
to
a
footman
or
the
handing
of
a
cigarette
to
herself
was
her
husband
s
obvious
unconcern
with
the
magnificence
of
his
surroundings
he
seemed
perfectly
at
his
ease
and
though
there
was
nothing
in
his
manner
which
suggested
a
sort
of
haughty
polish
which
she
felt
was
suitable
in
these
exalted
places
he
behaved
as
simply
as
if
he
was
at
home
in
fact
his
simplicity
almost
made
his
wife
blush
once
when
on
the
occasion
of
a
large
puff
of
smoke
coming
down
the
chimney
he
said
to
lord
inverbroom
i
can
show
you
a
new
cowl
which
will
quite
stop
but
lord
inverbroom
did
not
seem
the
least
uncomfortable
at
this
sudden
peeping
out
of
the
mercantile
cloven
hoof
and
merely
replied
that
a
cowl
that
would
prevent
that
chimney
from
smoking
would
be
worth
its
weight
in
gold
that
was
very
tactful
and
mrs
keeling
was
vexed
that
her
husband
would
not
leave
the
subject
instead
he
laughed
and
said
that
the
cowl
in
question
did
not
cost
much
more
than
its
weight
in
iron
then
luckily
the
talk
drifted
away
on
to
books
and
though
mrs
keeling
knew
that
by
all
the
rules
of
polite
behaviour
her
husband
should
have
been
engaging
his
hostess
in
light
conversation
while
she
talked
to
her
host
keeling
and
lord
inverbroom
quite
lost
themselves
in
discussing
some
italian
book
with
pictures
that
had
lately
appeared
lord
inverbroom
said
he
could
not
afford
it
which
must
be
a
joke
in
consequence
of
the
two
men
talking
together
she
was
left
to
lady
inverbroom
but
as
she
had
taken
the
trouble
to
read
the
small
paragraphs
in
a
society
journal
that
day
she
could
give
her
little
of
information
about
the
movements
of
the
king
and
the
royal
family
while
with
half
an
ear
she
continued
to
listen
to
her
husband
so
as
to
interrupt
in
case
he
tended
to
unsuitable
topics
again
but
she
was
so
dumbfoundered
when
à
propos
of
which
sounded
safe
enough
she
heard
lord
inverbroom
say
that
he
had
a
charming
one
lately
made
for
him
by
a
miss
propert
that
the
apposite
talk
she
was
engaged
in
died
on
her
lips
she
has
just
made
one
for
me
said
her
husband
perhaps
you
didn
t
know
that
she
lives
in
bracebridge
with
her
brother
she
is
my
secretary
and
indeed
i
wonder
if
you
would
let
her
come
over
here
one
day
i
should
like
to
show
her
my
books
with
her
in
them
saturday
perhaps
if
that
is
a
would
she
come
to
lunch
do
you
think
and
spend
the
afternoon
mrs
keeling
was
quite
horrified
she
longed
for
her
husband
to
tell
him
that
miss
propert
was
quite
a
humble
sort
of
person
then
luckily
it
occurred
to
her
that
no
doubt
the
idea
was
that
she
should
have
her
lunch
in
the
housekeeper
s
room
this
relieved
her
mind
and
she
continued
to
tell
lady
inverbroom
the
last
news
from
windsor
shortly
afterwards
with
a
little
pressing
on
the
part
of
her
hostess
she
was
induced
to
precede
her
out
of
the
leaving
the
men
alone
the
new
wing
of
the
hospital
was
a
subject
about
which
lord
inverbroom
wanted
to
talk
to
his
guest
and
for
a
little
while
that
engaged
them
this
open
weather
had
allowed
the
building
to
go
on
apace
and
by
the
end
of
march
the
wing
should
be
advanced
enough
to
permit
of
the
opening
ceremony
the
board
of
hospital
directors
would
see
to
that
and
lord
inverbroom
sketched
out
his
idea
for
the
day
the
ceremony
of
the
opening
he
proposed
should
be
in
the
morning
and
for
it
he
hoped
to
secure
the
presence
of
a
very
distinguished
personage
lunch
would
follow
and
if
mr
keeling
approved
he
would
at
the
luncheon
announce
the
name
of
the
munificent
giver
then
he
paused
a
moment
mr
keeling
he
said
i
think
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
prime
minister
would
wish
to
submit
your
name
to
the
king
as
the
recipient
of
some
honour
in
public
recognition
of
your
munificence
would
you
allow
me
in
confidence
to
tell
him
who
our
benefactor
is
and
would
you
in
case
he
sees
the
matter
as
i
do
be
disposed
to
accept
a
baronetcy
i
may
say
that
i
do
not
think
there
is
the
slightest
doubt
that
he
will
agree
with
me
perhaps
first
you
would
like
to
mention
it
to
mrs
keeling
had
no
doubts
on
this
subject
at
all
and
felt
sure
his
wife
would
have
none
he
was
not
in
the
least
a
snob
and
to
wish
to
be
a
baronet
implied
nothing
of
the
kind
i
should
be
very
much
gratified
and
honoured
he
said
very
well
perhaps
you
would
mention
it
to
your
wife
and
let
me
know
the
town
and
county
generally
owe
you
the
deepest
debt
of
now
there
was
another
subject
on
which
keeping
had
made
up
his
mind
to
speak
to
lord
inverbroom
and
this
intelligence
encouraged
him
to
do
so
by
purchasing
the
freehold
of
the
county
club
he
had
acquired
the
right
of
membership
but
with
that
streak
of
pride
which
was
characteristic
of
him
he
did
not
want
to
get
elected
to
the
club
as
a
right
he
had
since
he
had
made
the
purchase
thought
this
over
and
wished
to
stand
for
election
could
he
secure
a
proposer
and
seconder
like
any
other
candidate
that
being
so
he
did
not
intend
to
tell
lord
inverbroom
that
he
would
ex
officio
become
a
member
of
the
club
at
the
next
when
he
entered
into
possession
of
his
property
but
had
determined
to
ask
him
if
he
as
president
would
propose
him
in
the
ordinary
course
the
next
election
he
had
already
ascertained
took
place
early
in
april
when
his
blushing
honours
as
benefactor
to
the
hospital
and
baronet
would
be
fresh
upon
him
there
could
be
no
more
suitable
opportunity
for
his
request
than
the
present
i
wonder
if
you
would
do
me
a
great
favour
he
said
bluntly
i
feel
sure
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
me
to
do
you
any
favour
that
is
in
my
power
said
the
other
would
you
then
be
kind
enough
to
propose
me
for
election
to
the
county
club
next
april
said
keeling
there
was
a
pause
the
very
slightest
quite
imperceptible
to
keeling
though
john
would
probably
have
noticed
it
but
instantly
lord
inverbroom
made
up
his
mind
that
it
was
quite
impossible
to
refuse
this
thing
which
he
wished
had
not
been
asked
he
had
not
the
smallest
personal
objection
to
having
keeling
as
a
member
but
in
that
infinitesimal
pause
he
divined
he
was
afraid
unerringly
the
feeling
of
the
club
generally
ridiculous
it
might
be
as
many
are
but
he
knew
that
it
existed
and
in
general
he
shared
it
he
succeeded
however
in
keeping
cordiality
in
his
voice
in
consenting
to
do
what
he
felt
unable
to
refuse
i
shall
be
delighted
to
he
said
have
you
got
a
seconder
ah
i
think
that
is
not
necessary
when
the
president
proposes
a
candidate
i
will
certainly
put
down
your
name
when
i
go
into
bracebridge
again
there
was
a
slight
pause
and
he
rose
trying
to
avoid
the
appearance
of
breaking
off
a
distasteful
subject
well
mr
keeling
he
said
i
mean
to
keep
you
up
a
long
time
in
my
library
so
shall
we
go
into
the
at
once
till
the
ladies
go
up
to
bed
dear
me
that
awful
chimney
it
would
be
very
good
of
you
if
you
would
let
me
have
the
cowl
you
told
me
late
as
it
was
when
keeling
went
upstairs
he
found
a
jubilant
and
wakeful
wife
waiting
for
him
with
a
positive
cargo
of
questions
and
impressions
which
she
had
to
unload
at
once
her
elation
took
a
condescending
and
critical
form
and
she
neither
wanted
nor
paused
for
answers
well
i
m
sure
it
s
been
a
very
pleasant
if
a
very
quiet
evening
she
said
there
s
nothing
nicer
than
to
dine
as
you
may
say
like
that
and
have
a
little
agreeable
conversation
afterwards
not
but
what
i
should
have
been
sorry
to
have
as
tough
a
pheasant
as
that
served
at
my
table
for
i
declare
i
could
hardly
get
my
teeth
into
it
though
it
did
come
on
a
silver
plate
and
nothing
but
a
nut
and
an
apple
for
dessert
though
you
can
get
choice
grapes
so
cheap
now
but
there
what
does
that
matter
when
you
dine
with
friends
such
a
pleasant
talk
as
i
had
too
with
lady
inverbroom
who
i
m
sure
is
a
very
sensible
and
agreeable
sort
of
woman
nothing
very
gifted
i
dare
say
but
a
great
deal
of
common
sense
common
sense
now
i
often
wish
it
was
commoner
but
the
time
passed
so
quickly
while
you
and
lord
inverbroom
were
talking
together
in
the
that
i
was
quite
surprised
when
you
came
in
the
soup
too
did
you
not
find
it
insipid
but
i
expect
lady
inverbroom
does
not
have
the
sort
of
cook
that
i
have
always
been
accustomed
to
no
jewels
either
just
that
little
diamond
brooch
which
made
me
feel
that
i
was
too
fine
with
the
beautiful
pearl
pendant
you
gave
me
for
my
birthday
don
t
you
agree
with
me
thomas
you
have
talked
about
fifty
things
my
dear
i
don
t
know
which
you
want
me
to
agree
with
you
about
said
he
well
we
will
let
it
pass
was
it
not
odd
that
lord
inverbroom
had
a
by
your
miss
propert
quite
a
coincidence
but
you
made
me
feel
quite
hot
when
you
talked
about
supplying
him
with
a
just
as
if
he
was
a
customer
not
that
it
really
matters
and
i
thought
you
got
on
wonderfully
well
though
no
doubt
you
felt
a
little
strange
at
first
and
what
did
you
and
lord
inverbroom
talk
about
when
we
left
you
books
i
keeling
sat
down
by
the
fire
if
you
want
to
know
i
will
tell
you
he
said
of
course
i
want
to
know
what
should
i
ask
for
unless
i
wanted
to
know
parkinson
tells
me
they
had
quite
a
common
supper
in
the
room
nothing
out
of
the
way
just
some
of
the
fish
that
was
left
over
and
cold
beef
i
must
ask
lady
inverbroom
to
drop
in
to
lunch
some
day
when
she
is
in
bracebridge
and
let
her
see
how
a
pheasant
should
be
i
am
going
to
tell
you
what
we
talked
about
if
you
will
be
quiet
for
a
moment
you
do
not
yet
know
that
i
have
given
them
the
new
wing
to
the
hospital
what
you
gave
the
new
wing
well
to
think
of
your
having
kept
me
in
the
dark
all
this
time
i
do
call
that
very
generous
but
generous
you
always
are
as
i
ve
often
told
mamma
about
your
money
i
suppose
that
will
cost
a
great
deal
of
yes
a
great
deal
kindly
allow
me
to
get
on
you
are
not
to
tell
anybody
about
it
till
the
day
it
is
opened
when
it
will
be
announced
lord
inverbroom
thinks
i
shall
be
given
a
baronetcy
he
suggested
that
i
should
tell
you
and
see
what
you
thought
about
mrs
keeling
sat
straight
up
in
bed
well
i
never
she
said
indeed
mamma
was
right
when
she
said
some
people
got
on
in
the
world
sir
thomas
keeling
and
lady
keeling
it
sounds
very
well
does
it
not
i
do
call
that
money
well
laid
out
however
much
it
was
sir
thomas
and
lady
keeling
i
hope
parkinson
will
pick
it
up
quickly
and
not
stumble
over
it
my
lady
instead
of
ma
she
will
have
to
it
was
easy
to
see
out
of
the
depths
of
futilities
that
mrs
keeling
was
pleased
and
her
husband
retired
to
his
and
shut
the
door
on
her
raptures
it
was
largely
the
remembrance
of
this
visit
and
the
future
accession
of
dignity
which
it
had
foreshadowed
that
inspired
mrs
keeling
as
she
drove
home
in
her
victoria
after
at
st
thomas
s
a
few
sundays
later
with
so
comfortable
a
sense
of
her
general
felicity
the
thought
of
being
addressed
on
her
envelopes
as
lady
keeling
and
by
parkinson
as
my
lady
caused
her
to
take
a
livelier
interest
in
the
future
than
she
usually
did
for
the
comfortable
present
was
generally
enough
for
her
and
with
regard
to
the
present
her
horizon
was
singularly
unclouded
apart
from
the
fact
that
alice
was
suffering
from
influenza
an
infliction
which
her
mother
bore
very
calmly
her
mind
was
not
nimble
and
it
took
her
all
the
time
that
the
horse
occupied
in
traversing
the
road
from
the
church
to
the
cedars
in
surveying
those
horizons
and
running
over
as
she
had
just
been
bidden
to
do
by
mr
silverdale
in
his
sermon
her
numerous
causes
for
thankfulness
she
hardly
knew
where
to
begin
but
the
which
her
husband
had
given
her
on
her
birthday
and
now
oscillated
with
the
movement
of
the
carriage
on
the
platinum
chain
round
her
ample
neck
formed
a
satisfactory
it
really
was
very
handsome
and
since
she
did
not
hold
with
the
notion
that
presents
were
only
tokens
of
affection
and
that
the
kind
thought
that
prompted
a
gift
was
of
greater
value
than
its
she
found
great
pleasure
in
the
size
and
lustre
of
the
pearl
indeed
she
rather
considered
the
value
of
the
gift
to
be
the
criterion
of
the
kindness
of
thought
that
had
prompted
it
and
by
that
standard
her
husband
s
thought
had
been
very
kind
indeed
she
had
never
known
a
kinder
since
now
many
years
ago
he
had
given
her
the
of
diamonds
that
sparkled
on
her
finger
and
this
gift
had
been
all
of
a
piece
with
his
general
conduct
she
knew
for
a
fact
that
he
was
going
to
behave
with
his
usual
generosity
at
christmas
to
her
mother
and
he
had
promised
herself
and
alice
a
fortnight
s
holiday
at
brighton
in
february
perhaps
he
would
come
with
them
but
it
was
more
likely
that
business
would
detain
him
she
found
she
did
not
care
whether
he
came
or
not
it
was
her
duty
to
be
contented
whatever
happened
when
everything
was
so
pleasant
this
imaginative
flight
into
the
future
fatigued
her
or
at
any
rate
demanded
an
effort
on
the
part
of
her
brain
and
very
naturally
she
went
back
to
the
blessings
that
she
found
it
easier
to
call
to
mind
since
they
already
existed
quite
high
among
these
a
little
lower
perhaps
than
the
pleasure
of
being
lady
mayoress
but
higher
than
the
fact
that
alice
was
distinctly
better
this
morning
was
the
sensible
way
in
which
her
husband
had
behaved
about
those
odd
evening
visits
of
miss
propert
when
she
worked
at
his
library
catalogue
faint
was
the
remembrance
of
that
unpleasant
moment
when
she
had
suddenly
appeared
among
all
the
guests
at
the
close
of
dinner
and
was
subsequently
introduced
into
the
but
after
that
those
visits
had
ceased
altogether
and
instead
miss
propert
came
in
the
middle
of
the
morning
when
her
husband
was
at
his
office
that
was
perfectly
in
accordance
with
the
rules
of
correct
behaviour
and
when
she
chanced
to
meet
norah
going
into
the
library
or
leaving
it
at
the
conclusion
of
her
work
she
always
had
a
civil
and
condescending
word
for
her
she
had
no
doubt
whatever
that
the
girl
was
a
very
decent
young
woman
in
her
station
of
life
which
was
as
much
as
could
be
said
about
anybody
at
this
point
she
sat
rather
more
upright
in
her
carriage
in
order
to
be
able
to
show
how
distant
and
stately
was
her
recognition
of
mrs
fyson
who
was
walking
not
driving
in
her
direction
she
gave
her
quite
a
little
bow
without
the
hint
of
a
smile
for
that
was
just
how
she
felt
to
mrs
fyson
and
the
more
clearly
mrs
fyson
grasped
that
fact
the
better
she
could
barely
see
mrs
fyson
that
was
the
truth
of
it
and
it
was
not
wholly
the
sunlit
mist
of
inverbroom
magnificence
that
obscured
her
it
is
true
that
since
the
inverbroom
visit
followed
up
by
a
lady
inverbroom
lunch
at
the
cedars
when
she
had
shown
her
how
a
pheasant
should
be
served
mrs
keeling
had
adopted
to
alfred
road
generally
the
attitude
of
a
balloon
hovering
bathed
in
sun
over
the
darkling
and
earth
below
it
and
this
would
very
usefully
tend
to
prepare
alfred
road
for
the
greater
elevation
to
which
she
would
suddenly
shoot
up
as
by
some
release
of
ballast
when
in
the
spring
a
certain
announcement
of
honours
should
be
promulgated
but
it
was
not
only
that
alfred
road
was
growing
dim
and
shadowy
beneath
her
that
prompted
this
stateliness
to
mrs
fyson
that
misguided
lady
not
a
true
lady
had
been
going
about
bracebridge
assuring
her
friends
that
mr
silverdale
had
been
so
very
attentive
to
her
daughter
julia
that
she
was
daily
expecting
that
mr
silverdale
would
seek
an
interview
with
mr
fyson
and
julia
a
blushing
one
with
her
now
as
mrs
keeling
was
daily
expecting
a
similar
set
of
interviews
to
take
place
at
the
cedars
it
was
clear
that
unless
mr
silverdale
contemplated
bigamist
proposals
which
would
certainly
be
a
very
great
change
from
his
celibate
convictions
mrs
fyson
must
be
considered
a
mischievous
and
jealous
tatler
several
days
ago
alice
had
appeared
suddenly
in
her
mother
s
boudoir
murdering
sleep
like
macbeth
to
inform
her
that
she
was
never
going
to
speak
to
julia
again
nor
wished
to
hear
her
name
mentioned
she
gave
no
reason
nor
did
mrs
keeling
need
one
for
this
severance
of
relations
beyond
saying
that
certain
remarks
of
mrs
fyson
were
the
immediate
cause
she
then
immediately
went
to
bed
with
influenza
which
her
mother
attributed
to
rage
and
shock
this
though
the
last
of
mrs
fyson
s
misdeeds
was
not
the
first
and
mrs
keeling
almost
forgot
the
duty
of
thankfulness
for
blessings
when
she
remembered
that
dreadful
occasion
shortly
after
norah
s
final
appearance
in
the
evening
mrs
fyson
had
called
and
under
the
pretext
of
a
after
her
dinner
had
hissed
out
a
series
of
impertinent
questions
as
to
how
it
had
all
fool
though
she
might
be
mrs
keeling
was
not
of
that
peculiarly
hopeless
sort
that
confides
domestic
difficulties
to
the
ears
of
gossips
and
had
with
some
appearance
of
astonishment
merely
said
that
she
and
miss
propert
had
had
a
very
pleasant
chat
while
mr
keeling
was
telephoning
for
a
cab
to
take
miss
propert
home
on
which
mrs
fyson
had
looked
exactly
like
a
ferret
and
said
did
he
bring
her
into
your
that
was
clever
the
remembrance
of
this
odious
suggestion
was
the
only
thing
that
seemed
to
cloud
the
serenity
of
mrs
keeling
s
horizon
indeed
it
scarcely
did
that
and
corresponded
rather
to
a
very
slight
fall
in
the
barometer
though
no
signs
of
untoward
weather
were
anywhere
visible
she
did
not
often
think
of
it
but
she
knew
that
it
had
not
like
so
many
more
important
things
entirely
vanished
from
her
mind
and
when
she
did
think
of
it
it
produced
this
slight
declension
from
weather
otherwise
set
fair
but
immediately
afterwards
her
reflections
would
flutter
away
to
the
the
inverbroom
visit
and
the
baronetage
she
had
arrived
at
the
front
door
of
the
cedars
and
as
it
was
rather
too
cold
to
wait
for
the
boy
covered
with
buttons
to
remove
her
rug
she
managed
to
do
that
for
herself
just
as
she
stepped
into
the
gothic
porch
the
opened
and
norah
came
out
this
was
something
of
a
surprise
it
had
not
previously
occurred
to
her
that
the
went
on
on
sundays
but
it
was
no
business
of
hers
whether
her
husband
s
secretary
chose
to
behave
in
an
unsabbatical
if
not
heathenish
manner
that
was
quite
her
own
concern
and
a
small
elephantine
reproach
was
all
that
the
occasion
demanded
why
miss
propert
she
said
fancy
working
on
sunday
morning
when
all
good
people
are
at
church
norah
looked
not
only
surprised
but
startled
but
she
instantly
recovered
herself
i
know
it
is
wicked
of
me
she
said
but
i
so
much
wanted
to
get
on
with
my
work
you
are
back
early
aren
t
you
this
was
true
the
sermon
on
the
duty
of
thankfulness
had
been
short
though
joyous
and
there
was
no
litany
mrs
keeling
had
already
congratulated
herself
on
that
for
she
would
have
time
to
rest
well
before
lunch
and
perhaps
see
alice
when
she
had
rested
but
when
after
a
few
more
gracious
remarks
she
found
herself
in
the
hall
she
did
not
immediately
go
to
her
boudoir
to
rest
perhaps
some
little
noise
from
the
library
only
heard
caused
her
to
pause
and
then
mrs
fyson
s
unforgotten
remark
occurring
to
her
she
went
to
that
door
and
opened
it
her
husband
whom
she
supposed
to
be
at
the
cathedral
was
standing
in
front
of
the
fire
back
from
cathedral
already
thomas
she
said
yes
my
dear
and
you
from
church
i
sat
in
the
nave
if
you
want
to
know
and
came
out
before
the
he
paused
a
moment
probably
you
met
miss
propert
at
the
door
he
said
she
has
been
working
at
the
catalogue
i
find
how
is
alice
this
morning
have
you
seen
her
the
gently
wagged
at
mrs
keeling
s
throat
mrs
fyson
s
comment
gently
stirred
in
her
head
she
would
have
said
this
was
clever
too
this
introduction
of
miss
propert
s
name
without
waiting
for
his
wife
to
mention
it
clever
or
not
it
served
its
immediate
purpose
for
she
gave
him
news
of
alice
the
sooner
you
take
her
off
to
the
seaside
the
better
he
said
change
of
air
will
do
her
good
i
should
go
this
week
if
i
were
it
seemed
to
mrs
keeling
that
this
was
not
being
clever
but
stupid
she
felt
that
it
was
a
designed
diversion
to
distract
her
thoughts
she
was
being
again
without
the
pearl
and
was
not
going
to
be
put
off
like
that
oh
i
have
too
many
engagements
to
think
of
that
she
said
and
you
would
not
be
able
to
come
with
me
there
is
little
chance
of
that
whenever
you
go
said
he
an
awful
an
notion
came
into
poor
mrs
keeling
s
head
she
determined
on
light
banter
her
intentions
were
excellent
her
performance
deplorable
too
busy
over
the
catalogue
eh
she
asked
coming
away
before
the
sermon
too
naughty
as
mr
silverdale
would
say
oh
i
understand
my
the
effect
of
this
light
humour
was
not
at
all
what
she
had
anticipated
he
turned
swiftly
round
to
her
with
a
face
appallingly
grim
never
mind
what
mr
silverdale
would
say
he
said
tell
me
what
it
is
that
you
understand
now
quick
what
is
it
you
understand
she
retreated
a
step
with
a
fallen
face
what
s
the
matter
she
said
dear
me
what
is
the
matter
it
was
only
my
instantly
he
saw
his
mistake
he
had
had
the
opportunity
to
treat
the
subject
in
the
same
playful
spirit
but
he
had
been
unable
to
it
was
all
too
serious
to
him
the
grim
puritan
streak
in
him
which
had
not
prevented
his
falling
in
love
with
norah
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
jest
or
suffer
a
jest
about
it
he
was
not
a
flirt
and
did
not
care
to
have
that
tawdry
cloak
thrown
on
to
his
shoulders
but
he
had
made
a
mistake
he
ought
to
have
accepted
that
ridiculous
decoration
with
a
grin
as
ridiculous
now
he
tried
to
recapture
the
belated
inanity
ah
you
re
just
chaffing
me
he
said
and
there
s
no
harm
in
that
but
i
didn
t
care
for
what
mr
silverdale
would
say
he
s
naughty
too
if
he
s
not
going
to
ask
poor
alice
to
marry
him
when
she
s
recovered
from
her
influenza
or
have
you
done
as
i
asked
you
and
cut
your
daughter
out
yourself
that
s
a
joke
too
one
bad
joke
deserves
another
suddenly
it
struck
him
that
the
situation
was
parallel
to
but
more
significant
than
that
which
had
occurred
in
her
when
norah
had
come
into
it
for
a
few
minutes
one
snowy
evening
then
as
now
his
wife
had
hinted
at
an
underlying
truth
which
he
was
aware
of
then
as
now
he
had
scolded
her
for
the
ridiculous
suggestion
her
words
implied
but
the
same
situation
was
intensified
it
presented
itself
to
him
in
colours
many
tones
more
vivid
even
as
the
underlying
truth
had
become
of
far
greater
concern
to
him
and
unless
he
was
mistaken
it
had
become
much
more
real
to
his
wife
her
first
vague
stupid
but
suspicion
had
acquired
solidity
in
her
mind
he
doubted
whether
he
could
so
to
speak
bomb
it
to
bits
by
the
throwing
to
her
of
a
she
looked
at
him
a
moment
with
eyes
behind
which
there
smouldered
a
real
though
a
veiled
hostility
and
he
found
himself
wishing
that
she
would
put
it
into
words
and
repeat
definitely
and
seriously
the
accusation
at
which
her
dismal
little
jest
about
the
work
of
the
catalogue
keeping
him
here
in
bracebridge
had
hinted
then
he
could
have
denied
it
more
explicitly
and
with
a
violence
that
might
have
impressed
her
but
his
roughness
his
fierce
challenging
of
her
stupid
chaff
had
effectively
frightened
her
off
any
such
repetition
and
she
gave
him
no
opportunity
of
denial
or
defence
only
as
she
left
him
with
the
intention
of
seeing
alice
before
lunch
he
noted
this
intensified
situation
it
had
become
more
explosive
more
dangerous
and
now
instead
of
taking
it
boldly
out
into
the
open
and
encouraging
it
to
explode
with
probably
no
very
destructive
results
he
had
caused
his
wife
to
lock
it
up
in
the
confined
space
of
her
own
mind
hiding
it
away
from
his
anger
or
his
ridicule
but
it
was
doubtful
whether
she
had
detached
the
smouldering
fuse
of
her
own
suspicions
they
were
at
present
of
no
very
swiftly
inflammable
stuff
there
was
but
a
vague
sense
that
her
husband
was
more
interested
in
norah
than
he
should
be
and
had
he
answered
her
chaff
with
something
equally
light
she
might
easily
have
put
out
that
smouldering
fuse
but
he
had
not
done
that
he
had
flared
and
scolded
and
his
attempt
to
respond
in
the
same
spirit
was
hopelessly
belated
she
began
to
wonder
whether
mrs
fyson
was
not
right
true
mrs
fyson
had
said
very
little
but
that
little
appeared
now
to
be
singularly
suggestive
the
various
sale
departments
at
the
stores
were
thronged
all
day
from
morning
to
night
during
this
week
before
christmas
with
crowds
of
purchasers
but
the
correspondence
on
business
matters
such
as
engaged
norah
fell
off
as
the
holidays
approached
and
next
morning
when
she
arrived
she
found
not
more
than
a
dozen
letters
for
her
to
open
charles
however
was
being
worked
off
his
feet
in
the
where
were
a
hundred
types
of
suitable
christmas
gifts
the
more
expensive
being
bound
in
stuffed
morocco
so
that
the
sides
of
them
resembled
flattish
cushions
and
norah
intended
as
soon
as
she
had
finished
her
shorthand
transcription
to
proceed
at
once
with
the
typewriting
and
then
ask
leave
of
keeling
to
go
and
help
her
brother
he
arrived
but
a
few
minutes
after
her
and
in
half
an
hour
her
shorthand
dictation
was
finished
i
was
going
to
typewrite
these
at
once
she
said
if
you
ll
allow
me
and
then
go
and
help
charles
in
the
book
keeling
pushed
back
his
chair
as
he
often
did
when
he
was
disposed
for
a
few
minutes
talk
putting
a
gap
between
himself
and
his
business
table
he
gave
her
a
smile
and
a
long
look
have
you
seen
the
books
he
said
i
m
almost
ashamed
to
get
a
profit
out
of
such
muck
beastly
paper
beastly
printing
and
squash
bindings
the
more
expensive
they
are
the
more
she
laughed
they
are
pretty
bad
she
said
but
there
s
a
big
sale
for
them
may
i
go
and
help
charles
and
not
do
any
work
in
my
library
this
morning
he
asked
unless
you
wish
me
he
paused
i
do
rather
he
said
i
want
that
work
to
go
on
as
usual
monday
is
your
regular
day
to
go
now
yesterday
when
norah
met
mrs
keeling
in
the
porch
the
latter
had
been
so
very
normal
and
condescending
that
she
had
scarcely
given
another
thought
to
the
encounter
mrs
keeling
had
often
met
her
coming
or
going
to
her
work
and
had
always
a
word
for
her
even
as
she
had
had
yesterday
but
instantly
now
when
keeling
expressed
a
wish
that
she
should
go
there
this
morning
she
connected
it
in
her
mind
with
that
meeting
i
will
go
if
you
like
she
said
i
shall
be
obliged
if
you
will
i
have
a
certain
reason
for
wishing
it
it
s
a
rubbishy
reason
enough
and
i
needn
t
bother
you
with
she
looked
up
at
him
and
it
was
clear
to
each
when
their
eyes
met
that
the
same
species
of
thought
was
in
the
mind
of
both
both
at
any
rate
were
thinking
of
what
had
occurred
yesterday
but
immediately
she
looked
away
again
silently
pondering
something
and
he
watching
her
saw
that
soft
frown
like
a
vertical
appear
between
her
eyebrows
then
it
cleared
again
and
she
looked
at
him
with
a
smile
that
conveyed
her
comprehension
of
the
rubbishy
reason
and
a
sudden
flush
that
came
over
her
face
confirmed
that
to
him
naturally
it
was
as
awkward
even
as
impossible
for
her
to
speak
of
it
as
it
was
for
him
she
could
but
consent
to
go
or
refuse
to
i
expect
i
see
your
point
she
said
i
will
for
the
first
time
it
occurred
to
him
that
she
had
a
voice
in
the
matter
that
it
was
only
fair
to
her
to
suggest
that
she
should
give
up
these
visits
to
his
house
altogether
he
would
not
be
there
when
she
went
but
she
understood
now
indeed
she
had
understood
long
ago
when
she
made
her
entry
into
the
that
mrs
keeling
had
so
to
speak
her
eye
on
them
it
was
due
to
norah
that
she
should
be
allowed
to
say
whether
she
wanted
that
eye
taken
off
her
don
t
go
unless
you
wish
he
said
suddenly
give
up
the
catalogue
altogether
if
you
the
moment
he
suggested
that
her
whole
nature
her
consciousness
of
the
entire
innocence
of
her
visits
there
was
up
in
arms
against
the
proposal
not
to
go
there
would
imply
that
there
was
a
reason
for
not
going
there
and
there
was
none
whatever
had
passed
between
mrs
keeling
and
her
husband
yesterday
was
no
business
of
hers
she
intended
to
finish
her
work
this
conclusion
was
comprised
in
the
decision
with
which
she
answered
him
why
should
i
give
up
the
catalogue
she
said
i
have
no
intention
of
doing
so
unless
you
tell
me
to
my
business
is
to
finish
keeling
hesitated
he
wanted
to
say
something
to
her
which
showed
however
remotely
the
gleam
of
his
feelings
something
which
should
let
that
spark
of
unspoken
comprehension
flash
backwards
and
forwards
again
yes
it
s
just
a
matter
of
business
isn
t
it
he
said
she
met
his
eyes
with
complete
frankness
there
was
nothing
to
show
whether
she
had
caught
the
suggestion
that
lurked
in
his
speech
or
not
then
shall
i
go
down
to
your
house
now
and
get
on
with
my
business
she
said
he
was
half
disappointed
half
pleased
but
wisely
he
gave
up
the
idea
of
conveying
to
her
that
there
was
anything
more
than
business
for
him
in
her
working
among
his
books
if
she
understood
that
her
handling
them
her
passing
hours
in
his
room
her
preparing
his
catalogue
was
something
so
utterly
different
from
what
it
would
have
been
if
any
one
else
was
doing
it
for
him
she
would
have
found
the
hint
of
that
in
what
he
had
said
if
she
did
not
well
it
was
exactly
there
that
the
disappointment
came
in
he
pulled
his
chair
a
little
nearer
to
the
table
again
where
his
work
lay
there
is
one
other
thing
he
said
you
get
four
days
holiday
at
christmas
you
and
your
brother
are
you
going
to
spend
them
here
i
suppose
then
take
my
advice
and
make
your
brother
go
to
the
seaside
with
you
instead
you
ve
been
rather
overworked
lately
and
he
has
too
a
change
would
do
you
both
oh
i
don
t
think
we
shall
go
away
she
said
he
fidgeted
with
his
papers
a
moment
when
money
concerned
business
he
could
discuss
and
bargain
with
the
nonchalance
of
a
man
who
had
passed
his
life
in
making
it
but
when
money
began
to
trespass
on
the
privacies
of
life
there
was
no
one
in
the
world
more
shy
of
mentioning
it
miss
propert
he
said
don
t
think
me
impertinent
but
if
there
s
any
question
of
expense
about
your
going
away
please
let
me
advance
you
the
money
i
shall
be
paying
you
for
my
catalogue
you
ve
done
a
good
deal
of
work
on
it
already
it
is
quite
a
reasonable
the
moment
he
said
that
norah
knew
that
she
did
not
want
to
be
paid
at
all
for
her
work
on
the
catalogue
when
she
undertook
to
do
it
he
had
just
mentioned
the
question
of
payment
saying
that
she
would
let
him
know
her
charges
some
time
but
since
then
the
thought
of
what
she
was
going
to
charge
had
not
entered
her
head
and
now
when
she
thought
of
those
pleasant
hours
in
his
library
she
disliked
the
thought
of
payment
i
don
t
want
to
be
paid
at
all
she
said
it
was
most
of
it
work
done
in
office
hours
when
otherwise
i
should
have
been
in
the
office
here
i
have
done
a
certain
amount
in
the
evening
but
i
enjoyed
it
i
found
it
much
more
amusing
than
playing
no
i
can
t
allow
that
for
a
moment
he
said
what
if
you
have
to
she
asked
smiling
i
shall
not
have
the
catalogue
completed
and
i
shall
insist
on
paying
for
what
you
have
done
i
shall
get
an
estimate
of
your
work
made
and
a
price
he
did
not
smile
back
at
her
he
looked
at
the
table
and
drummed
it
with
his
fingers
as
she
had
often
seen
him
do
when
he
was
discussing
some
business
point
on
which
he
did
not
intend
to
yield
are
you
serious
she
asked
i
was
never
more
but
i
have
really
enjoyed
doing
it
i
i
have
done
it
for
the
sake
of
books
i
like
doing
things
for
keeling
stopped
his
drumming
fingers
and
looked
up
with
his
grim
face
relaxing
don
t
remind
me
of
that
affair
over
my
he
said
you
are
putting
me
into
an
odious
position
it
isn
t
generous
of
what
am
i
to
do
then
she
asked
he
took
his
out
of
his
drawer
and
wrote
take
that
on
account
please
he
said
if
you
want
to
be
give
me
a
receipt
and
i
advise
you
to
spend
some
of
it
on
a
little
she
looked
at
the
cheque
i
can
t
take
that
as
part
payment
she
said
it
is
fully
as
much
as
the
completed
catalogue
will
you
are
very
obstinate
he
said
i
will
get
an
independent
estimate
of
what
is
a
fair
price
for
the
completed
catalogue
when
you
have
finished
it
and
adjust
my
payment
by
that
will
that
satisfy
you
quite
but
it
seems
to
me
i
am
far
from
obstinate
i
have
given
of
course
i
credit
you
with
so
much
suddenly
norah
found
she
did
not
mind
yielding
to
him
she
was
rather
surprised
at
that
for
she
knew
there
was
some
truth
in
charles
s
criticism
that
she
preferred
her
own
way
to
anybody
else
s
it
was
an
amiable
way
but
she
liked
having
it
but
now
when
keeling
so
much
took
it
for
granted
that
she
was
going
to
do
as
he
suggested
she
found
she
had
no
objection
to
it
she
wondered
why
thank
you
very
much
she
said
i
will
try
to
persuade
charles
to
take
your
advice
too
and
come
away
for
a
few
days
and
now
i
ll
go
down
to
your
house
oh
your
receipt
shall
i
write
it
and
file
it
he
had
already
pulled
a
sheaf
of
papers
towards
him
and
was
turning
them
over
please
he
said
it
was
a
crisp
morning
with
touches
of
frost
lingering
in
shadowed
places
where
the
warmth
of
the
winter
sunshine
had
not
reached
them
and
norah
preferred
walking
to
taking
the
bus
that
would
have
set
her
down
at
the
corner
where
alfred
street
became
alfred
road
she
was
keenly
sensitive
to
the
suggestion
of
brisk
sunshine
or
the
depression
of
heavy
weather
but
the
kindly
vigour
of
this
winter
morning
did
not
wholly
account
for
the
exhilaration
and
glee
of
her
blood
there
was
more
than
that
in
it
the
drench
of
a
december
gale
would
hardly
have
affected
her
as
she
went
she
let
herself
examine
for
the
first
time
the
conditions
that
for
the
last
six
weeks
had
caused
her
every
morning
to
awake
with
the
sense
of
pleasure
and
eager
anticipation
of
the
ensuing
day
hitherto
she
had
diverted
her
mind
from
causes
and
been
contented
with
effects
her
that
work
which
had
begun
so
distastefully
pleased
and
interested
her
her
catalogue
work
enthralled
her
and
now
she
turned
round
the
corner
so
to
speak
of
herself
and
asked
herself
why
this
sunshine
was
spread
over
all
she
did
she
made
no
reservation
on
the
subject
she
told
herself
that
it
was
because
these
things
were
done
with
keeling
or
for
him
with
equal
frankness
now
that
she
had
brought
herself
face
to
face
with
the
question
she
affirmed
that
she
was
not
in
love
with
him
and
as
far
as
she
could
know
herself
at
all
she
knew
that
to
be
true
but
it
was
equally
true
that
she
had
never
met
any
one
who
so
satisfied
her
never
for
a
moment
had
the
least
hint
of
sentimentality
entered
into
their
intercourse
he
could
be
and
sometimes
was
gruff
and
grim
and
she
accepted
his
grimnesses
and
gruffnesses
because
they
were
his
at
other
times
he
showed
a
comprehending
consideration
for
her
and
she
welcomed
his
comprehension
and
his
considerateness
for
exactly
the
same
reason
she
knew
she
would
not
have
cared
the
toss
of
a
brass
farthing
if
mr
silverdale
had
comprehended
her
or
a
railway
porter
had
been
considerate
of
her
all
her
life
she
had
been
independent
and
industrious
and
that
had
sufficed
for
her
she
had
not
wanted
anything
from
anybody
except
employment
and
a
decent
recompense
her
emotional
life
had
vented
itself
on
those
beloved
creatures
called
books
and
on
that
divine
veiled
figure
called
art
that
stood
behind
them
and
prompted
as
from
behind
some
her
deft
imaginative
work
in
designing
and
executing
the
wood
blocks
for
in
every
one
there
is
a
secret
fountain
which
pours
itself
out
broadcast
or
quietly
leaks
and
so
saves
itself
from
bursting
books
and
the
dreams
she
wove
into
her
blocks
had
given
her
that
leakage
and
here
had
her
fountain
thrown
up
its
feather
of
sparkling
waters
she
had
not
been
without
certain
expression
of
herself
in
more
human
terms
she
had
for
years
borne
patiently
with
a
querulous
mother
but
her
patience
and
care
for
her
had
been
the
expression
of
decent
and
filial
behaviour
rather
than
of
herself
when
that
task
was
over
she
had
gone
with
comradeship
to
her
brother
with
whom
she
had
a
greater
affinity
of
tastes
but
now
as
she
walked
westwards
in
the
snap
of
wintry
air
and
the
joy
of
wintry
sun
she
realised
how
completely
sisterhood
and
the
kinship
of
a
bookish
mind
accounted
for
her
devotion
to
him
they
were
the
best
of
friends
they
lived
together
in
the
most
amicable
equality
in
a
comfortable
atmosphere
of
courtesy
and
affection
she
gave
and
she
took
they
lived
and
worked
together
equally
and
that
sense
of
fairness
of
reasonable
contract
between
brother
and
sister
was
the
root
of
their
harmonious
companionship
and
now
so
she
instinctively
recognised
that
sort
of
satisfaction
in
human
intercourse
had
become
to
her
childish
and
elementary
it
was
good
nothing
could
be
better
as
far
as
it
went
but
this
morning
she
felt
as
some
musician
might
feel
if
he
was
asked
to
content
himself
with
a
series
of
full
plain
common
chords
on
the
piano
nothing
could
be
better
as
far
as
it
went
than
that
uncomplicated
common
chord
nor
as
far
as
it
went
could
anything
be
better
than
living
with
so
amiable
and
understanding
a
brother
only
now
she
wanted
to
give
instead
of
to
give
and
take
she
wanted
to
lose
the
sense
of
fairness
to
serve
and
not
to
be
served
she
had
the
satisfaction
and
that
made
her
step
the
more
briskly
and
gave
the
sunshine
this
mysterious
power
of
exhilaration
of
knowing
that
she
was
serving
and
supplying
she
loved
the
knowledge
that
never
had
keeling
s
typewriting
been
done
for
him
so
flawlessly
that
never
had
the
details
of
his
business
such
as
came
within
her
ken
been
so
unerringly
recorded
he
might
ask
for
the
reference
to
the
minutest
point
in
a
letter
and
she
could
always
reinforce
his
deficient
memory
of
it
and
turn
up
the
letter
itself
for
confirmation
of
her
knowledge
when
days
of
overwhelming
work
had
occurred
and
he
had
suggested
getting
in
a
second
typewriter
to
assist
her
she
had
always
with
a
mixture
of
pride
in
her
own
efficiency
and
of
jealousy
of
a
helping
hand
proved
herself
capable
of
tackling
any
task
that
might
be
set
her
probably
she
could
not
have
done
it
for
any
one
else
but
she
could
do
it
for
him
it
was
easier
so
she
told
herself
to
do
his
work
herself
than
to
instruct
anybody
else
what
to
do
she
allowed
herself
just
that
shade
of
knowing
all
the
time
that
there
were
plenty
of
routine
letters
that
any
one
else
could
have
done
as
well
as
she
but
she
did
not
want
anybody
else
to
do
them
she
was
passing
through
the
disused
graveyard
of
the
cathedral
where
the
clipped
hedge
of
hornbeam
bounded
the
asphalt
path
the
browned
leaves
still
clung
to
the
trees
and
she
suddenly
remembered
how
she
had
passed
down
this
path
with
charles
and
had
said
how
distasteful
it
was
to
work
for
a
cad
her
own
words
to
hang
on
the
air
even
as
the
leaves
still
clung
to
the
hedge
and
she
tried
in
vain
to
remember
the
mood
in
which
those
words
were
green
as
the
hornbeam
leaves
had
then
been
instead
of
being
brown
and
lifeless
lifeless
they
were
there
was
no
vitality
in
them
they
but
clung
to
her
memory
as
the
brown
leaves
to
the
hedge
she
was
scarcely
ashamed
of
them
she
only
wondered
at
them
just
as
in
parenthesis
of
her
thought
she
wondered
at
the
clothed
twigs
when
all
the
other
trees
had
shed
their
foliage
they
were
not
evergreen
they
were
just
dead
she
came
out
by
this
short
cut
across
the
cathedral
close
where
the
would
have
taken
her
and
saw
the
row
of
separated
houses
stretch
westward
in
alfred
road
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
was
the
cedars
with
the
delightful
big
library
and
the
abominable
residuum
of
the
house
very
likely
she
would
see
mrs
keeling
or
miss
keeling
it
was
not
only
in
matters
of
office
work
of
swift
shorthand
of
impeccable
typewriting
that
she
was
of
use
to
him
she
guessed
that
he
found
in
her
a
companionship
that
mrs
keeling
with
her
and
her
propriety
could
not
supply
norah
knew
all
about
the
mrs
keeling
had
told
her
as
it
wagged
at
her
throat
that
her
husband
had
given
it
her
on
her
birthday
and
was
it
not
handsome
it
was
tremendously
handsome
there
was
no
doubt
whatever
about
that
but
the
mattered
to
norah
exactly
as
much
as
did
the
cheque
which
she
had
just
been
given
it
mattered
less
indeed
it
did
not
express
anything
she
faced
the
conclusion
that
her
vague
exhilaration
of
thought
had
brought
her
to
she
did
not
only
serve
him
in
his
office
she
served
him
here
in
the
cedars
neither
mrs
keeling
nor
his
daughter
could
make
his
for
him
irrespective
of
their
inability
he
would
not
have
allowed
them
to
attempt
it
but
she
could
do
it
he
gave
her
access
to
his
library
and
a
free
hand
to
do
as
she
liked
there
she
turned
in
at
the
gate
and
went
up
the
drive
to
the
gothic
porch
he
gave
her
more
than
that
he
gave
her
his
need
of
her
he
had
expressed
that
when
he
had
said
her
catalogue
work
was
a
pure
matter
of
business
what
he
meant
and
what
she
understood
was
that
it
was
not
the
boy
covered
with
buttons
opened
the
door
to
her
she
hoped
that
mrs
keeling
would
not
be
richly
crossing
the
gothic
hall
she
wanted
only
to
get
quietly
into
the
library
and
go
on
with
letter
letter
m
implied
a
quantity
of
cardboard
slips
she
wanted
to
be
left
alone
in
the
library
working
for
him
it
did
not
matter
whether
he
paid
her
for
her
work
or
not
she
only
wanted
to
go
on
working
for
him
chapter
vii
alice
keeling
had
arrived
at
that
stage
of
convalescence
after
her
influenza
when
there
is
dawn
on
the
wreck
and
it
seems
faintly
possible
that
the
world
will
again
eventually
prove
to
contain
more
than
temperature
thermometers
and
she
was
going
to
leave
bracebridge
with
her
mother
next
day
for
the
projected
fortnight
at
brighton
and
had
tottered
up
and
down
the
gravel
path
round
the
garden
this
morning
for
half
an
hour
to
accustom
herself
to
air
and
locomotion
again
while
she
was
out
she
had
heard
the
telephone
bell
ring
inside
the
house
a
sound
that
always
suggested
to
her
nowadays
an
entrancing
possibility
and
this
was
confirmed
when
parkinson
came
out
to
tell
her
that
mr
silverdale
would
like
to
speak
to
her
at
that
she
ceased
to
totter
her
feet
positively
twinkled
on
their
way
to
the
little
round
black
ear
of
the
machine
and
the
entrancing
possibility
was
confirmed
might
mr
silverdale
drop
in
for
the
cup
that
cheered
that
afternoon
and
was
she
better
and
would
she
promise
not
to
be
naughty
and
get
ill
again
indeed
she
was
vastly
better
on
the
moment
and
said
down
the
telephone
in
a
voice
still
slightly
hoarse
i
m
not
naughty
me
dood
in
the
much
affected
by
her
and
mr
silverdale
alice
was
not
of
a
prevaricating
or
deceptive
nature
but
having
suddenly
remembered
that
her
mother
was
opening
a
bazaar
that
afternoon
and
would
not
be
back
for
tea
she
gaily
hastened
to
forget
that
again
for
the
chance
of
having
tea
alone
with
mr
silverdale
must
not
be
jeopardised
by
such
infinitesimal
proprieties
she
hastened
also
to
forget
to
tell
her
mother
that
he
had
proposed
himself
and
only
remembered
to
change
her
dress
after
lunch
for
something
more
becoming
she
choose
with
a
view
to
brightening
herself
up
a
daring
red
gown
which
made
her
by
contrast
look
rather
whiter
than
the
influenza
had
really
left
her
but
she
did
not
mind
that
it
was
obviously
out
of
the
question
to
look
in
rosy
and
blooming
health
and
the
best
alternative
was
to
appear
interestingly
pale
she
remembered
also
to
order
hot
buns
for
tea
though
the
idea
of
eating
one
in
her
present
state
was
provocative
of
a
shuddering
qualm
and
having
her
mother
safely
off
the
premises
sat
waiting
in
mrs
keeling
s
boudoir
ready
to
ring
for
tea
as
soon
as
her
visitor
appeared
punctually
the
sound
of
the
bell
and
according
to
his
custom
he
came
running
across
the
tapped
at
the
boudoir
door
and
peeped
in
his
head
alone
appearing
may
me
come
in
he
said
and
how
are
us
he
took
her
hand
and
playfully
pretended
to
feel
her
pulse
now
this
is
doctor
s
orders
he
said
you
are
to
sit
cosily
by
the
fire
and
talk
to
any
poor
parson
who
comes
to
see
you
the
dose
is
to
be
taken
at
exactly
four
he
sat
down
on
the
in
front
of
her
chair
and
looked
round
the
room
this
is
the
pleasantest
club
i
know
he
said
and
where
s
the
president
alice
guessed
what
he
meant
in
a
moment
i
don
t
think
mother
is
in
yet
she
said
we
won
t
wait
tea
for
her
buns
there
they
are
and
it
s
two
lumps
of
sugar
isn
t
it
and
how
are
you
better
he
said
better
already
poor
parson
has
been
lonely
without
his
dear
kind
helper
but
now
he
s
got
her
alice
gave
a
little
quiver
of
delight
and
the
cup
she
handed
him
rocked
on
its
saucer
but
poor
parson
s
going
to
be
lonely
again
isn
t
he
he
went
on
didn
t
ickle
bird
tell
him
that
helper
was
going
to
spread
wings
and
fly
away
to
brighton
for
a
fortnight
he
mustn
t
be
selfish
mustn
t
poor
parson
but
only
be
glad
to
think
of
helper
sitting
in
the
sun
and
drinking
in
life
and
health
alice
wished
that
julia
fyson
could
hear
him
say
that
julia
fyson
probably
would
have
if
she
had
had
the
influenza
too
but
that
benumbing
possibility
did
not
enter
alice
s
head
he
had
called
her
helper
before
but
the
oftener
he
called
her
that
the
better
and
now
helper
is
going
to
ask
questions
she
said
formally
adopting
the
name
she
wants
to
know
if
poor
parson
has
been
good
and
not
been
overworking
he
turned
to
her
with
an
air
of
childlike
frankness
he
s
been
pretty
good
he
said
not
bad
enough
to
be
scolded
but
if
helper
will
get
nasty
influenza
why
parson
must
do
some
of
her
alice
could
not
keep
up
this
pretty
jesting
tone
any
longer
it
was
much
too
serious
and
wonderful
a
thing
to
jest
about
that
she
should
really
be
his
helper
oh
mr
silverdale
she
said
have
i
really
been
of
any
use
to
you
he
began
to
be
firmly
conscious
of
a
wish
that
mrs
keeling
would
appear
alice
s
pale
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
with
an
almost
alarming
expression
of
earnestness
he
took
refuge
in
the
pretty
jesting
again
once
upon
a
time
he
said
there
was
a
young
lady
of
such
a
modest
disposition
that
though
she
had
a
sunday
school
and
a
boys
class
and
made
a
beautiful
beautiful
oh
helper
he
broke
off
we
had
your
in
use
for
the
first
time
last
sunday
and
you
not
there
to
see
how
smart
it
that
was
another
of
the
ways
in
which
he
made
religious
matters
real
to
many
of
his
congregation
he
used
the
phraseology
even
the
slang
of
ordinary
life
about
them
speaking
of
such
a
ripping
prayer
or
such
a
jolly
oh
i
hope
it
fitted
well
said
alice
diverted
for
the
moment
by
the
mention
of
this
piece
of
ecclesiastical
finery
it
was
a
perfect
fit
i
wish
my
coats
fitted
as
well
i
looked
round
to
see
if
i
couldn
t
catch
the
eye
of
my
helper
and
there
wasn
t
a
helper
there
at
all
i
wondered
if
you
were
ill
i
could
think
of
nothing
else
that
would
have
kept
you
away
and
just
said
a
wee
bitty
prayer
for
helper
and
then
after
church
i
heard
that
she
had
horrid
old
flue
and
now
may
i
make
chimney
smoke
smoke
not
smell
nasty
to
poor
this
was
a
joke
of
standing
and
asked
permission
to
light
a
cigarette
leave
was
given
him
and
he
insisted
that
she
should
strike
the
match
and
hold
it
to
the
end
of
his
cigarette
poor
parson
has
no
business
to
indulge
himself
he
said
and
blew
the
inhaled
smoke
up
the
chimney
in
a
gay
puff
he
had
steered
the
conversation
away
from
the
tidings
that
gleamed
from
alice
s
earnest
eyes
he
had
taken
it
past
that
dangerous
corner
of
religion
from
which
she
might
bolt
back
again
to
earnestness
and
had
brought
it
to
its
congenial
base
of
legitimate
clerical
flirtation
which
allowed
him
to
talk
with
adoring
parishioners
and
squeeze
hands
and
dab
on
the
presumption
that
all
this
meant
no
more
to
anybody
else
than
to
him
this
was
pure
assumption
it
meant
much
more
to
poor
alice
for
one
brief
moment
a
certain
penetrated
her
infatuation
a
certain
unidealising
vision
inherited
probably
from
her
father
came
to
her
aid
giving
her
a
warning
both
peremptory
and
final
for
that
one
moment
she
saw
this
adored
priest
as
he
was
more
or
less
to
whom
this
and
this
squeezing
of
hands
and
this
lighting
of
matches
were
not
symbols
of
anything
that
lay
behind
them
but
only
expressive
of
an
amorous
anæmia
had
he
been
in
earnest
with
a
hundredth
part
of
her
intention
he
would
have
caught
at
it
made
plain
his
want
and
even
if
marriage
was
not
within
the
scope
of
his
desire
reached
a
hand
to
the
love
she
brought
him
and
claimed
the
comradeship
of
it
even
if
he
could
do
no
more
but
in
this
moment
of
clear
vision
she
saw
and
she
knew
that
he
did
not
even
do
that
he
but
sat
on
the
and
wagged
his
tail
and
barked
for
biscuits
then
the
clouds
of
her
own
foolishness
derived
perhaps
from
her
mother
s
side
and
strangely
swollen
by
her
individual
temperament
obscured
that
brief
ray
of
common
sense
and
she
yielded
herself
up
to
the
entrancement
of
having
mr
silverdale
sitting
on
the
floor
at
her
feet
and
lighting
his
cigarette
from
her
match
a
sudden
idiotic
courage
possessed
her
she
proposed
to
put
things
to
the
touch
the
flickering
firelight
and
her
sense
of
convalescence
inspired
her
he
had
called
her
helper
he
had
said
a
thousand
things
behind
which
meaning
might
lurk
it
was
her
business
like
that
of
every
sensible
girl
who
wants
to
be
married
to
show
him
that
his
shy
advances
met
a
slightly
less
shy
welcome
a
wave
of
calculating
fatuousness
combed
over
her
poor
parson
doesn
t
indulge
himself
as
much
as
he
ought
she
said
he
won
t
think
a
wee
bitty
about
his
own
happiness
and
so
he
makes
others
think
of
it
for
alice
looked
not
at
him
as
she
said
these
remarkable
words
but
at
the
pink
clock
on
the
she
had
the
recklessness
of
physical
weakness
in
her
she
did
not
care
what
happened
if
only
one
thing
happened
if
he
would
not
take
that
lure
she
was
quite
prepared
to
try
him
with
another
he
half
took
it
he
rose
at
it
but
so
to
speak
rose
short
he
continued
to
use
in
order
to
indicate
the
distance
that
separated
him
from
the
earnest
eyes
that
so
pointedly
looked
at
the
pink
clock
poor
parson
knows
kind
friends
are
thinking
for
him
he
said
he
knows
it
too
well
perhaps
he
is
so
selfish
that
he
leaves
his
happiness
in
the
hands
of
others
and
doesn
t
bother
about
it
suddenly
it
struck
this
unfortunate
clergyman
that
his
words
might
conceivedly
bear
a
disastrous
interpretation
to
his
adorer
anything
was
better
than
to
let
such
an
interpretation
become
coherent
he
felt
that
alice
had
been
encouraged
to
be
on
the
point
of
proposing
to
him
without
a
moment
s
delay
since
every
moment
was
precious
so
long
as
alice
did
not
take
possession
of
it
he
switched
off
violently
on
to
religious
topics
just
now
they
had
seemed
dangerous
to
him
at
this
awful
moment
they
presented
the
appearance
of
an
ark
of
refuge
parson
has
got
too
much
to
think
about
he
hastily
continued
to
allow
him
to
think
of
his
own
happiness
isn
t
it
true
dear
miss
alice
that
we
only
get
our
own
happiness
when
we
are
thinking
not
about
ourselves
i
thought
about
myself
for
half
an
hour
this
morning
and
i
did
get
so
dreadfully
bored
i
thought
how
pleased
i
should
be
if
and
how
delighted
i
should
be
if
and
then
thank
god
i
found
myself
yawning
it
was
all
so
stupid
i
don
t
believe
you
could
be
stupid
said
alice
with
her
infernal
calmness
that
again
terrified
him
stupid
i
am
always
stupid
he
said
i
want
to
something
for
everybody
committed
to
my
charge
i
want
to
give
myself
to
the
drunkards
and
the
drabs
and
the
unbelievers
but
i
am
like
a
foolish
cook
i
do
not
know
how
to
serve
myself
up
so
as
to
become
he
could
not
help
drawing
a
long
breath
of
cigarette
smoke
mixed
with
relief
he
thought
that
the
corner
had
been
quite
safely
steered
round
there
they
were
back
again
in
parish
work
and
what
could
be
nicer
he
disregarded
alice
s
gasp
of
appreciation
at
his
modesty
and
proceeded
with
an
increased
sense
of
comfort
give
give
he
said
give
and
ask
nothing
what
you
get
doesn
t
matter
does
it
he
was
feeling
so
comfortable
now
that
he
scarcely
wished
for
mrs
keeling
s
entry
alice
s
earnest
eyes
so
he
told
himself
thereby
revealing
his
ignorance
of
psychology
were
dim
with
the
perception
of
this
fine
interrogation
he
was
being
wonderful
as
he
had
so
often
been
before
and
the
perception
of
that
would
surely
fill
her
soul
with
the
altruistic
glee
that
possessed
himself
he
began
in
the
sense
of
personal
security
which
this
gave
him
to
get
a
little
incautious
he
did
not
wait
for
her
acceptance
of
the
prodigious
doctrine
that
nothing
you
get
matters
to
the
problematical
getter
but
construed
his
own
sense
of
security
into
her
acquiescence
so
let
us
give
he
said
just
as
if
he
was
perorating
in
the
pulpit
let
us
give
till
we
have
spent
all
our
energies
that
will
take
a
long
time
won
t
it
for
the
act
of
giving
seems
but
to
increase
your
capability
of
it
dear
miss
alice
i
have
a
thousand
plans
that
are
yet
unrealised
a
thousand
schemes
for
this
little
parish
of
ours
we
must
have
more
schools
for
religious
education
more
classes
more
lives
unselfishly
lived
i
want
all
the
help
i
can
get
i
want
to
transfuse
st
thomas
s
with
the
certainty
that
the
doubting
disciple
lacked
but
i
can
t
do
it
alone
those
who
see
must
lend
me
their
eyes
i
am
a
mere
stupid
man
i
and
then
the
fatuous
voice
suddenly
ceased
to
his
extreme
terror
alice
with
her
earnest
eyes
leaned
forwards
towards
him
she
was
husky
through
influenza
but
the
purport
of
what
she
said
was
horribly
clear
oh
mr
silverdale
she
said
do
you
really
mean
that
that
you
can
t
work
alone
as
a
mere
man
do
you
alice
drew
a
long
breath
that
wheezed
in
her
poor
throat
and
covered
her
eyes
with
her
hands
for
she
was
dazzled
with
the
vision
that
was
surely
turning
real
to
her
to
his
helper
he
had
said
that
he
was
no
use
as
a
mere
man
surely
the
purport
of
that
was
clear
do
you
mean
me
she
said
mr
silverdale
got
up
off
the
hearthrug
where
he
had
been
sitting
nursing
his
knees
with
miraculous
celerity
she
behind
her
hidden
eyes
heard
him
and
knew
she
felt
she
knew
that
in
another
moment
would
come
the
touch
of
his
hands
on
hers
as
he
took
them
and
bade
her
look
at
him
perhaps
he
would
say
look
at
me
my
darling
perhaps
his
delicious
joking
ways
would
even
at
this
sublimest
of
moments
still
assert
themselves
and
he
would
say
but
whatever
he
did
would
be
delicious
would
be
perfect
but
no
touch
came
on
her
hands
and
there
was
a
long
an
awful
moment
of
dead
silence
while
behind
poor
alice
s
hands
the
dazzle
died
out
of
her
vision
before
it
was
broken
she
perceived
that
beyond
a
shadow
of
doubt
he
did
not
mean
her
and
both
were
he
in
the
shame
of
having
provoked
a
passion
he
had
no
use
for
she
in
the
shame
of
having
revealed
the
passion
he
had
not
invited
she
had
come
to
the
wrong
house
she
was
an
unbidden
guest
who
must
be
directed
outside
the
again
she
got
up
the
sense
of
being
wronged
for
the
moment
drowning
her
shame
it
was
his
fault
he
had
made
her
think
that
he
wanted
her
she
had
long
been
termed
his
helper
and
now
he
had
made
himself
clear
by
terming
himself
the
mere
man
at
least
she
had
thought
he
made
himself
clear
but
the
silence
made
him
clearer
i
see
you
don
t
mean
me
she
said
quietly
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
confirm
the
justness
of
this
perception
my
dear
miss
alice
he
said
i
am
infinitely
from
the
mere
habit
of
pawing
he
laid
his
hand
on
hers
infinitely
distressed
he
repeated
i
had
no
idea
that
you
ever
looked
upon
me
he
could
not
complete
that
outrageous
falsity
with
alice
s
eyes
fixed
on
him
she
waited
she
longed
to
withdraw
her
hand
from
under
his
it
itched
to
pluck
itself
away
and
yet
some
influence
from
herself
kept
it
there
delighting
in
his
touch
the
resentment
at
the
encouragement
she
had
received
which
had
provoked
this
ghastly
fiasco
faded
from
her
her
shame
at
having
precipitated
it
faded
also
and
her
mind
even
in
this
cataclysm
but
sunned
itself
in
his
presence
but
that
lasted
only
for
a
moment
her
shame
toppled
it
off
its
again
and
again
her
sense
of
the
wanton
flirting
of
which
she
had
been
the
victim
banished
her
shame
never
in
all
the
years
of
her
placid
existence
had
her
mother
felt
the
poignancy
of
any
one
of
those
emotions
which
made
tumult
together
in
alice
s
heart
and
as
if
that
was
not
enough
another
added
its
discordant
shrillness
to
the
babel
within
her
she
pulled
her
hand
away
tell
me
one
thing
she
said
is
there
some
one
else
is
it
julia
fyson
oh
mr
silverdale
do
tell
me
it
is
not
julia
fyson
mr
silverdale
suffered
at
that
moment
a
profound
disappointment
he
had
been
telling
himself
that
his
hand
was
exercising
a
calming
and
controlling
influence
over
this
poor
lady
and
that
presently
she
would
say
something
very
sensible
and
proper
though
he
could
not
quite
tell
what
this
would
be
instead
it
was
as
if
a
wild
cat
had
suddenly
leaped
out
at
him
certainly
it
is
not
miss
julia
fyson
he
exclaimed
in
great
dismay
for
the
moment
his
chronic
fatuous
complacency
in
the
possession
of
his
habitual
adorers
quite
faded
from
his
mind
they
were
intended
to
adore
him
tenderly
reverentially
fervently
but
not
to
make
proposals
of
marriage
to
him
he
really
did
not
care
if
he
never
put
his
arm
round
julia
fyson
s
waist
again
i
assure
you
it
is
not
miss
fyson
he
reiterated
wiping
his
moist
forehead
i
wonder
at
your
suggesting
it
besides
you
surely
know
my
views
about
the
celibacy
of
the
the
humorousness
as
it
would
have
struck
a
bystander
of
this
amazing
anticlimax
escaped
alice
she
knew
it
was
an
anticlimax
for
she
was
not
giving
two
thoughts
to
his
principles
but
was
only
involved
in
his
practices
anger
suddenly
flamed
in
her
giving
her
an
odd
grotesque
dignity
i
dare
say
i
have
heard
you
express
them
she
said
but
i
have
also
heard
you
express
intimacy
and
affection
towards
me
you
always
encouraged
me
you
held
my
hand
you
whispered
to
me
and
once
after
my
confession
you
no
no
said
mr
silverdale
hurriedly
but
you
did
you
kissed
me
on
the
forehead
and
called
me
a
little
child
said
alice
with
indignation
that
waxed
as
she
recalled
those
tokens
mr
silverdale
clasped
his
hands
together
i
am
infinitely
distressed
he
began
but
alice
with
her
temper
rising
to
heights
uncontemplated
interrupted
him
you
said
that
twice
before
she
said
and
i
don
t
believe
you
care
a
hush
said
mr
silverdale
holding
up
his
hand
as
he
did
at
the
benediction
i
won
t
hush
you
did
all
those
things
and
what
was
a
girl
to
make
of
them
except
what
i
made
of
them
i
put
the
natural
construction
on
them
and
you
know
the
hand
of
benediction
did
not
seem
to
be
acting
well
and
mr
silverdale
took
it
down
he
used
it
instead
to
cover
his
eyes
he
was
quite
genuinely
sorry
for
alice
but
at
the
back
of
his
mind
he
could
not
help
considering
what
a
wonderful
person
he
must
be
to
inspire
this
passion
without
ever
having
meant
to
there
was
a
fascination
about
him
i
am
deeply
grieved
he
said
but
as
you
will
not
listen
to
anything
i
say
there
is
no
use
in
my
saying
any
more
miss
he
put
back
his
head
in
a
proud
misunderstood
attitude
and
instantly
at
the
thought
of
his
leaving
her
like
this
alice
s
anger
began
to
ooze
out
of
her
she
pictured
what
the
room
would
be
like
when
the
boudoir
door
had
closed
behind
him
its
intolerable
emptiness
but
she
had
still
enough
resentment
left
not
to
stop
him
she
said
aren
t
you
going
to
shake
hands
he
asked
the
dying
flame
flickered
up
again
we
ve
got
nothing
to
shake
hands
about
she
said
he
bowed
his
head
with
a
marvellous
proud
meekness
and
left
her
alice
sat
down
again
by
the
fire
and
picked
up
a
piece
of
buttered
bun
with
a
semicircular
bite
out
of
it
which
had
fallen
on
the
carpet
he
must
have
been
in
the
middle
of
that
mastication
when
the
fiasco
began
yet
he
could
not
have
been
for
he
had
begun
to
smoke
perhaps
he
took
another
bun
after
he
had
finished
his
cigarette
she
considered
this
with
a
detached
curiosity
it
seemed
to
occupy
all
her
mind
then
the
boy
covered
with
buttons
came
in
to
remove
the
and
she
noticed
he
had
a
piece
of
sticking
plaster
in
the
middle
of
his
forehead
that
was
interesting
too
and
curious
and
then
she
had
a
firm
an
absolute
conviction
that
mr
silverdale
had
not
gone
away
that
he
was
waiting
in
the
hall
unable
to
tear
himself
from
her
and
yet
forbidden
by
his
pride
to
come
back
he
had
only
left
the
room
a
couple
of
minutes
and
surely
she
would
find
him
seated
in
one
of
the
gothic
chairs
in
the
hall
with
his
hand
over
his
face
she
must
go
to
him
their
eyes
would
meet
and
somehow
or
other
the
awful
misunderstanding
and
estrangement
in
which
they
had
parted
would
melt
away
he
would
say
life
is
too
strong
for
me
farewell
the
celibacy
of
the
clergy
or
something
like
that
or
he
would
hold
her
hand
for
a
long
a
very
long
time
and
perhaps
whisper
then
blessings
on
the
fallings
out
or
whatever
happens
nothing
must
interrupt
our
perhaps
the
farewell
to
the
celibacy
of
the
clergy
was
an
exaggerated
optimism
but
she
would
be
so
content
so
happy
with
much
less
than
that
provided
always
that
he
did
not
say
his
farewell
to
celibacy
with
julia
fyson
she
would
be
enraptured
to
continue
on
the
old
terms
now
that
she
understood
what
he
meant
and
what
he
did
not
mean
and
perhaps
she
had
spoiled
it
all
so
that
he
would
never
again
hold
her
hand
or
whisper
to
her
or
kiss
her
with
that
sort
of
tender
and
fraternal
affection
as
once
in
the
vestry
when
she
had
made
her
guileless
confession
to
him
it
was
a
a
coming
almost
from
realms
above
and
now
she
had
thrown
that
in
his
teeth
she
had
altogether
failed
to
understand
him
him
and
his
friendship
his
comradeship
and
his
pawings
in
the
fading
of
her
anger
she
longed
for
all
that
which
she
had
thought
meant
so
much
but
which
she
prized
now
for
its
own
sake
surely
she
would
find
him
still
lingering
in
the
hall
sorrowful
and
unhappy
and
misunderstood
but
not
reproachful
for
he
was
too
sublime
for
that
he
had
said
he
was
infinitely
grieved
several
times
and
he
would
be
great
enough
to
forgive
her
perhaps
he
would
be
too
deeply
hurt
to
make
any
of
those
appropriate
little
speeches
she
had
devised
for
him
and
if
so
the
reconciliation
for
which
already
she
yearned
the
of
their
relations
on
the
old
maudlin
lines
must
come
from
her
initiative
already
with
that
curious
passion
some
women
have
for
being
beaten
and
she
longed
to
humble
herself
to
entreat
his
forgiveness
she
did
not
wait
to
put
on
a
shawl
but
walked
quickly
across
the
where
she
had
so
often
heard
his
nimble
tripping
approach
and
across
the
inner
hall
and
out
into
that
gothic
apartment
where
she
would
surely
find
him
before
she
got
there
she
had
only
one
desire
left
to
abase
herself
and
be
raised
up
again
she
was
and
as
she
came
into
the
outer
hall
her
heart
for
a
moment
leaped
within
her
for
she
thought
she
saw
him
standing
in
the
dusky
corner
by
the
library
door
then
with
a
sickening
reaction
she
saw
the
phantom
resolve
itself
into
a
coat
and
hat
of
her
father
s
hanging
up
there
and
she
saw
that
the
hall
was
empty
and
mr
silverdale
gone
still
she
would
not
give
up
he
might
be
standing
just
outside
unable
quite
to
leave
her
like
this
and
opening
the
front
door
she
looked
out
on
to
the
dusk
but
certainly
there
was
no
one
there
she
went
back
to
her
mother
s
room
and
deliberately
proceeded
to
torture
herself
she
had
been
to
blame
throughout
and
not
a
spark
of
anger
or
resentment
came
to
comfort
her
all
these
past
months
he
had
brought
joy
and
purpose
into
her
aimless
life
and
she
had
but
bitten
the
hand
that
fed
her
and
even
worse
than
that
had
scolded
its
owner
for
his
bounty
it
was
with
a
sense
of
incredulity
that
she
recalled
some
of
her
awful
phrases
her
rude
snappish
interruptions
and
yet
in
the
midst
of
her
she
knew
that
she
felt
thrills
of
excitement
both
at
what
had
happened
and
what
was
taking
shape
in
her
brain
as
to
what
was
going
to
happen
she
had
just
that
pleasure
in
her
agonies
of
as
does
the
penitent
who
scourges
himself
she
liked
it
to
hurt
she
gloried
in
the
castigation
that
was
surely
doing
her
good
tingling
from
her
penance
she
went
to
her
mother
s
writing
table
for
she
had
to
complete
her
humiliation
by
writing
to
him
without
delay
and
expressing
fully
and
unreservedly
all
that
had
made
this
last
so
replete
with
the
luxury
of
but
the
expression
of
it
was
not
so
easy
as
the
perception
of
it
had
been
and
she
made
half
a
dozen
beginnings
without
satisfying
herself
one
began
oh
mr
silverdale
how
could
i
but
then
she
despaired
of
how
to
proceed
another
began
i
have
honestly
gone
over
every
moment
of
this
afternoon
and
i
find
there
is
not
a
single
point
in
which
i
am
not
entirely
to
blame
but
that
was
too
and
lacked
emotion
but
when
she
was
almost
in
despair
at
these
futile
efforts
a
brilliant
idea
came
into
her
head
she
would
write
in
which
would
surely
touch
his
heart
when
he
remembered
how
many
serious
things
he
and
she
had
discussed
together
in
this
pretty
jesting
fashion
me
vewy
sorry
she
wrote
me
all
messy
with
sorrowness
o
poor
parson
your
helper
is
vewy
miserable
may
things
be
as
before
will
oo
forget
and
forgive
and
let
everything
be
again
fvom
your
wicked
little
helper
who
hates
she
could
not
improve
on
that
either
for
silliness
or
pathetic
sincerity
and
unable
to
contemplate
the
delay
which
the
post
would
entail
she
gave
it
to
the
boy
covered
with
buttons
to
carry
it
at
once
by
hand
to
the
vicarage
and
wait
for
an
answer
that
would
take
half
an
hour
there
were
thirty
delicious
minutes
of
suspense
for
though
she
did
not
doubt
the
purport
of
his
answer
it
was
thrilling
to
have
to
wait
for
it
the
thrillingness
was
slightly
shorn
of
its
vibrations
by
the
return
of
her
mother
who
had
a
great
deal
to
say
about
the
felicitous
manner
in
which
she
had
opened
the
bazaar
she
had
brought
back
with
her
a
small
plush
monkey
climbing
a
string
and
a
realistic
representation
of
a
spider
s
web
with
a
woolly
spider
sitting
in
the
middle
of
it
the
rim
of
the
web
was
fitted
with
hooks
so
that
you
could
hang
it
up
anywhere
she
selected
the
base
of
the
pink
clock
as
the
most
suitable
site
is
it
not
clever
and
quaint
she
said
i
must
really
tell
jane
that
it
is
not
a
real
one
or
she
will
be
dusting
it
away
and
the
monkey
too
that
is
even
quainter
you
can
bend
its
arms
and
legs
into
all
sorts
of
attitudes
i
made
a
little
speech
dear
and
there
was
lady
inverbroom
on
one
side
of
me
and
mrs
crawshaw
on
the
other
it
was
quite
a
gathering
of
county
people
lady
inverbroom
asked
after
you
no
i
think
i
told
her
you
had
the
influenza
first
and
then
she
asked
after
you
yes
that
was
the
way
of
it
she
had
a
mantle
on
which
i
don
t
think
can
have
cost
more
than
four
guineas
but
then
i
m
sure
it
s
not
her
fault
if
she
has
to
economise
for
my
part
if
i
had
all
those
pictures
with
that
great
house
to
keep
up
i
should
get
my
husband
to
sell
one
or
two
and
treat
myself
to
a
bit
of
finery
and
a
better
dinner
in
the
perhaps
they
are
entailed
said
alice
thinking
that
by
now
her
note
would
have
arrived
at
the
vicarage
very
likely
my
dear
said
her
mother
though
it
s
poor
work
entailing
your
pictures
if
you
haven
t
got
anybody
to
leave
them
to
indeed
i
don
t
see
how
they
could
be
entailed
unless
you
had
somebody
nearer
than
a
second
cousin
to
entail
them
for
i
shouldn
t
think
the
law
would
allow
that
for
so
distant
a
relation
though
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
bless
me
you
ve
put
on
your
new
red
dress
whatever
have
you
done
that
for
just
to
sit
quietly
before
the
fire
at
home
alice
had
the
sense
not
to
conceal
a
perfectly
ordinary
and
innocent
event
which
if
concealed
and
subsequently
detected
would
make
the
concealment
of
it
significant
oh
mr
silverdale
came
to
tea
she
said
he
all
alone
with
you
said
mrs
keeling
archly
well
i
m
sure
what
did
you
talk
about
or
is
it
stupid
of
me
to
ask
that
alice
felt
her
colour
rising
till
she
imagined
her
face
as
red
as
her
gown
she
decided
to
treat
the
question
humorously
very
stupid
mamma
dear
she
said
i
couldn
t
dream
of
telling
you
all
we
said
to
each
at
this
moment
the
boy
covered
with
buttons
entered
mr
silverdale
s
not
at
home
miss
he
said
but
he
will
be
given
your
note
when
he
comes
in
and
send
an
now
mrs
keeling
had
a
very
high
opinion
of
her
powers
of
tact
and
intuition
here
was
a
situation
that
promised
to
drive
the
final
nail
into
the
cheap
and
flimsy
coffin
of
mrs
fyson
s
hopes
mr
silverdale
had
come
to
tea
all
alone
with
alice
and
here
was
alice
writing
him
a
note
that
required
an
answer
not
half
an
hour
afterwards
her
intuition
instantly
told
her
that
mr
silverdale
had
made
a
proposal
of
marriage
to
alice
and
that
alice
had
written
to
him
saying
that
he
must
allow
her
a
little
time
to
think
it
over
why
alice
should
not
have
said
that
or
why
alice
should
not
have
instantly
accepted
him
her
intuition
did
not
tell
her
but
it
was
certain
that
no
other
grouping
of
surmises
would
fit
the
facts
then
her
intuition
having
done
its
work
though
bursting
with
curiosity
she
summoned
her
tact
to
her
aid
and
began
to
talk
about
the
spider
s
web
again
she
was
determined
not
to
pry
into
her
daughter
s
heart
but
wait
for
her
daughter
to
open
the
door
of
it
herself
alice
and
this
only
served
to
confirm
mrs
keeling
s
conjectures
responded
instantly
to
this
tactful
treatment
and
began
to
talk
so
excitedly
about
the
spider
s
web
and
the
plush
monkey
and
their
journey
to
brighton
next
day
that
mrs
keeling
almost
began
to
be
afraid
that
she
was
feverish
again
but
presently
this
volubility
died
down
and
she
sat
so
mrs
keeling
rightly
conjectured
listening
for
something
once
she
was
certain
that
she
heard
steps
in
the
next
room
and
went
to
see
if
her
father
had
come
in
once
she
was
almost
sure
that
the
telephone
bell
had
rung
and
wondered
who
it
could
be
disturbing
them
at
their
chat
over
the
fire
then
without
doubt
the
telephone
bell
did
ring
and
on
this
occasion
she
pretended
she
had
not
heard
it
but
hurriedly
left
the
room
on
the
pretext
of
taking
her
tonic
she
left
the
door
open
and
mrs
keeling
could
distinctly
hear
her
asking
her
tonic
apparently
who
it
was
though
well
aware
that
it
was
strychnine
then
after
a
pause
she
heard
her
thanking
her
tonic
ever
ever
so
much
and
she
came
back
looking
as
if
it
had
done
her
a
great
deal
of
good
already
odd
as
it
may
appear
there
were
limits
to
mrs
keeling
s
tact
or
to
state
the
matter
in
other
terms
none
to
her
curiosity
for
a
little
while
she
resisted
the
incoming
tide
but
when
alice
had
informed
her
brightly
for
the
third
time
that
their
train
started
at
next
morning
she
felt
so
strongly
that
a
mother
was
her
daughter
s
proper
confidante
that
her
tact
retreated
rapidly
towards
vanishing
point
i
saw
mrs
fyson
this
afternoon
she
said
beginning
gently
and
did
she
see
you
asked
alice
with
a
sort
of
idiotic
eagerness
all
the
time
there
was
ringing
in
her
head
like
a
peal
of
baritone
bells
through
the
quackings
of
the
telephone
the
lovely
words
my
dear
little
helper
bless
you
my
dear
little
i
imagine
so
as
i
was
opening
the
bazaar
said
mrs
keeling
with
some
dignity
of
course
yes
said
alice
with
enthusiasm
how
stupid
of
me
not
to
have
thought
of
that
that
lovely
spider
do
remember
to
tell
jane
not
to
dust
it
away
i
haven
t
seen
mrs
fyson
for
a
long
time
nor
julia
i
must
write
a
note
to
julia
wishing
her
before
i
go
to
brighton
dear
she
got
up
and
overturned
a
tray
of
pens
in
her
eagerness
to
write
to
julia
this
of
course
gave
fresh
provender
to
her
mother
s
intuition
she
could
put
two
and
two
together
as
well
as
most
people
and
hardly
ever
failed
to
make
the
result
it
was
quite
obvious
that
mr
silverdale
had
proposed
to
alice
and
that
in
consequence
mrs
fyson
s
expectations
for
julia
had
fallen
as
flat
as
a
no
wonder
alice
could
afford
to
forgive
her
friend
well
i
m
glad
to
hear
you
speak
like
that
dear
she
said
because
the
last
time
you
mentioned
julia
s
name
was
to
tell
me
that
you
didn
t
want
to
hear
it
mentioned
again
mrs
fyson
too
i
dare
say
she
is
a
very
woman
though
she
does
go
about
saying
that
all
sorts
of
things
are
happening
without
any
grounds
except
that
she
wants
them
alice
made
a
large
blot
on
her
paper
in
agitation
at
hearing
this
allusion
and
took
another
sheet
of
paper
and
i
am
sure
julia
has
an
excellent
heart
she
said
enthusiastically
recalling
mr
silverdale
s
definite
assurance
that
it
was
not
julia
at
the
time
she
had
been
so
full
of
more
personal
emotion
that
she
had
scarcely
cared
now
the
balm
of
that
was
divinely
soothing
quite
an
excellent
heart
she
said
julia
has
always
been
my
friend
except
just
lately
and
now
it
is
all
right
again
don
t
you
think
that
quarrels
sometimes
lead
to
even
warmer
attachments
mamma
mrs
keeling
tried
to
recollect
something
about
quarrels
she
had
been
party
to
there
was
the
case
of
the
two
little
tiffs
she
had
had
lately
with
her
husband
once
when
he
had
distinctly
sworn
at
her
once
when
he
had
asked
her
so
roughly
what
she
meant
with
regard
to
her
little
joke
about
norah
and
the
catalogue
one
of
those
so
it
suddenly
seemed
to
her
now
had
led
to
a
which
seemed
to
illustrate
alice
s
theory
of
quarrels
leading
to
warmer
attachments
she
had
not
connected
the
two
before
she
wondered
whether
mrs
fyson
would
say
that
that
was
very
clever
too
she
determined
to
think
it
over
when
she
had
leisure
at
present
she
was
too
curious
about
alice
to
attend
to
it
but
she
would
think
it
over
at
brighton
don
t
you
think
they
lead
to
warmer
attachments
mamma
repeated
alice
finding
she
got
no
answer
mrs
keeling
was
very
cunning
she
would
apply
this
to
alice
s
quarrel
with
julia
and
just
see
what
alice
would
say
next
well
dear
she
said
you
couldn
t
well
be
more
warmly
attached
to
julia
than
you
were
i
m
sure
you
used
to
be
quite
alice
gave
a
little
hoarse
laugh
oh
she
said
dear
julia
i
hope
we
shall
be
great
friends
again
when
i
come
back
from
brighton
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
i
am
clearly
the
quarrels
which
led
to
warmer
attachments
had
nothing
to
do
with
alice
s
late
fury
about
fysons
and
her
mother
throwing
tact
and
delicacy
about
a
daughter
s
heart
to
the
winds
tried
another
method
of
battering
her
way
into
it
she
could
not
conceive
why
alice
did
not
tell
her
that
mr
silverdale
had
proposed
to
her
i
ve
been
thinking
dear
she
said
that
it
would
be
but
kind
to
ask
mr
silverdale
down
to
brighton
while
we
are
there
he
looks
as
if
a
holiday
would
do
him
good
i
would
take
a
nice
room
for
him
in
the
hotel
and
of
course
he
would
use
our
sitting
room
of
course
i
should
make
it
quite
clear
to
him
that
he
was
my
guest
just
as
if
he
was
staying
with
us
here
such
walks
and
talks
as
you
and
he
could
have
what
do
you
think
of
that
for
a
plan
alice
was
so
stiff
with
horror
at
that
for
a
plan
that
she
could
barely
articulate
of
course
mr
silverdale
would
refuse
to
come
the
horror
was
but
due
to
the
mere
notion
that
he
should
be
asked
oh
i
don
t
think
that
would
do
at
all
mamma
she
said
it
would
be
a
very
odd
thing
to
i
don
t
see
why
you
and
he
are
such
friends
i
shall
write
to
him
and
suggest
it
or
you
might
perhaps
that
would
be
best
he
can
but
say
he
can
not
manage
it
though
for
my
part
i
should
be
very
much
surprised
if
he
did
not
alice
got
up
from
the
table
where
she
had
just
written
an
affectionate
little
note
to
julia
and
came
up
to
her
mother
s
chair
quivering
with
apprehension
you
really
must
do
nothing
of
the
sort
she
said
there
are
reasons
against
it
i
can
t
tell
you
mrs
keeling
s
powers
of
intuition
could
make
nothing
of
this
starting
with
the
firm
conviction
that
mr
silverdale
had
proposed
to
her
daughter
there
seemed
no
place
where
it
would
fit
in
you
are
very
mysterious
dear
she
said
you
seem
to
forget
that
i
am
your
mother
and
if
you
tell
me
that
i
must
speak
to
nobody
about
it
yet
you
may
be
sure
i
shall
not
do
so
without
your
leave
i
was
always
famous
for
my
ability
to
keep
a
secret
why
not
so
long
ago
your
father
told
me
something
which
i
am
sure
will
make
mrs
fyson
turn
quite
green
with
odious
jealousy
when
she
hears
it
and
i
have
not
breathed
a
word
to
anybody
not
a
word
so
don
t
be
so
mysterious
dear
i
remember
going
to
tell
mamma
the
moment
your
father
spoke
to
me
and
it
was
in
the
garden
behind
mamma
s
house
i
could
show
you
the
very
place
if
you
don
t
believe
but
mr
silverdale
hasn
t
spoken
to
me
like
that
said
poor
alice
well
then
there
s
a
reason
the
more
for
asking
him
to
brighton
said
mrs
keeling
now
quite
out
of
sight
of
her
tact
i
know
very
well
what
all
his
attentions
to
you
mean
i
ve
never
seen
a
man
so
devoted
for
i
m
sure
your
father
never
made
such
a
fuss
over
me
as
that
you
ve
got
to
meet
a
man
dear
it
s
only
right
to
show
him
that
you
are
not
indifferent
to
him
or
do
i
mean
that
he
s
not
indifferent
to
you
some
words
are
so
puzzling
he
wants
a
wife
i
can
see
that
and
you
may
trust
me
that
it
s
you
he
wants
i
shall
invite
him
to
brighton
and
if
you
only
behave
sensibly
he
ll
ask
you
before
we
re
even
thinking
of
coming
but
i
don
t
want
him
to
ask
me
said
alice
mrs
keeling
looked
positively
roguish
oh
you
just
wait
till
he
does
and
that
won
t
be
a
very
long
wait
she
said
you
think
you
ll
be
shy
and
nervous
but
you
won
t
when
your
turn
comes
i
ll
be
bound
you
like
him
well
enough
this
was
about
as
pleasant
to
alice
as
the
prodding
of
an
exposed
nerve
but
she
held
on
unshaken
to
the
main
point
if
you
ask
him
to
brighton
she
said
i
shall
instantly
write
to
tell
him
that
i
am
not
going
that
s
my
last
word
and
if
you
knew
what
has
happened
you
would
agree
with
me
he
won
t
come
but
i
can
t
have
him
alice
in
spite
of
her
influenza
and
the
shattering
events
of
this
afternoon
had
something
adamantine
about
her
she
paused
a
moment
please
promise
me
at
once
not
to
suggest
this
to
him
she
added
mrs
keeling
rose
from
her
chair
the
had
already
sounded
and
she
had
not
had
a
moment
s
rest
since
before
lunch
well
i
m
sure
it
s
little
reward
one
gets
for
being
a
mother
in
these
days
she
said
or
a
wife
either
for
what
with
your
father
s
typewriter
lording
it
in
the
library
and
you
telling
me
what
s
right
and
what
isn
t
in
my
own
room
there
s
little
left
for
me
to
be
mistress
of
i
wear
myself
to
the
bone
in
doing
my
duty
to
you
and
him
and
all
i
get
is
to
be
sworn
at
and
scolded
and
when
i
lie
awake
at
night
making
plans
for
your
future
you
tell
me
that
i
might
just
as
well
have
gone
to
sleep
for
you
won
t
permit
them
pray
may
i
go
and
dress
or
haw
you
any
other
orders
for
me
no
i
just
want
your
promise
that
you
won
t
ask
mr
silverdale
to
brighton
said
alice
unmoved
by
this
withering
sarcasm
well
what
s
the
use
of
repeating
that
like
a
parrot
observed
mrs
keeling
haven
t
i
promised
i
didn
t
hear
you
said
alice
well
then
you
may
have
your
own
way
and
be
crowed
over
by
mrs
fyson
since
you
prefer
that
to
being
taken
care
of
by
alice
s
smart
red
dress
was
good
enough
for
a
purely
domestic
dinner
and
she
sat
down
again
by
the
fire
when
her
mother
had
bewailed
herself
out
of
the
room
she
had
got
her
way
there
and
that
was
a
relief
she
was
mr
silverdale
s
helper
again
and
that
was
a
glow
that
had
penetrated
her
very
bones
when
she
wrote
the
little
to
him
she
felt
that
if
only
she
was
granted
such
a
welcome
back
as
had
been
conveyed
to
her
down
the
telephone
she
would
swoon
with
happiness
but
already
that
which
she
thirsted
for
was
dust
in
her
mouth
like
dead
sea
apples
she
guessed
that
his
little
caresses
and
whispers
had
meant
so
much
to
her
because
she
took
them
to
be
the
symbols
of
so
much
more
now
she
knew
better
they
were
without
meaning
and
the
measure
of
her
disillusionment
may
be
taken
from
the
fact
that
independently
of
all
that
had
happened
she
was
glad
that
there
would
be
no
chance
of
his
coming
to
brighton
she
wanted
him
to
love
her
and
failing
that
she
did
not
want
the
little
tokens
that
had
made
her
think
he
did
he
might
just
remain
in
bracebridge
and
dab
away
at
julia
if
he
wished
provided
only
that
he
meant
nothing
whatever
by
it
she
did
not
love
him
a
whit
the
less
but
just
now
she
did
not
want
him
whose
presence
for
these
last
six
months
had
filled
her
with
sunshine
she
must
go
away
into
the
dark
and
see
what
the
dark
felt
like
and
poor
alice
sitting
by
the
fire
in
her
smart
red
dress
began
to
make
the
most
extraordinary
faces
in
efforts
at
but
the
convulsions
in
her
throat
threatened
to
master
her
completely
and
with
bitten
quivering
lips
she
ran
to
her
room
and
burst
into
tears
chapter
viii
spring
weather
languid
and
damp
with
mild
airs
and
pale
suns
had
set
in
early
in
march
and
now
for
a
fortnight
the
restlessness
and
effervescence
of
the
vernal
month
had
been
busy
in
the
world
the
grass
showed
through
the
grayness
of
its
winter
foliage
the
of
the
fresh
green
spikes
and
spears
big
gummy
buds
stood
upon
the
chestnut
trees
a
sherbet
of
pink
almond
flowers
clothed
the
shrubs
all
along
the
front
gardens
of
alfred
road
and
daffodils
faithful
for
once
to
their
shakespearian
calendar
were
ready
with
a
day
or
two
more
of
sun
to
take
the
winds
of
march
with
beauty
birds
chirruped
in
every
bush
and
were
busy
with
straws
and
twigs
there
were
tokens
everywhere
of
the
great
renewal
then
came
three
days
of
hot
sun
and
tepid
night
showers
and
the
sheaths
of
buds
were
loosed
and
out
of
the
swollen
gummy
lumps
on
the
trees
burst
out
the
weak
chestnut
leaves
and
the
stiff
varnished
squibs
of
hawthorn
it
was
many
years
since
keeling
had
given
any
notice
at
all
to
such
unmarketable
objects
as
or
building
birds
spring
had
a
certain
significance
of
course
in
the
catering
department
for
early
vegetables
made
their
appearance
and
soon
there
would
arrive
the
demand
for
plovers
eggs
spring
in
fact
was
a
phenomenon
that
stirred
in
his
pocket
rather
than
his
heart
but
this
year
it
was
full
of
hints
to
him
of
delicate
sensations
too
fugitive
to
be
called
emotions
of
sudden
little
thrills
of
vague
longings
and
unformulated
desires
a
surreptitious
lurked
in
the
on
his
library
table
on
which
he
scrawled
the
date
of
some
new
flower
s
epiphany
or
the
fact
that
a
thrush
was
building
in
the
heart
of
a
syringa
outside
the
window
it
was
characteristic
of
his
business
habits
to
tabulate
those
things
it
was
characteristic
also
that
he
should
thrust
the
catalogue
deep
into
the
leaves
of
his
as
if
it
held
some
guilty
secret
on
this
particular
sunday
morning
he
had
not
gone
to
cathedral
service
at
all
but
after
his
wife
and
alice
had
set
forth
in
the
victoria
to
st
thomas
s
had
walked
out
westwards
along
the
road
from
the
cedars
to
where
half
a
mile
away
the
last
house
was
left
behind
and
the
billowing
downs
rolled
away
in
open
sea
out
of
sight
of
the
land
of
houses
in
the
main
it
was
the
sense
of
spring
with
its
intimate
stirrings
that
called
him
out
and
the
adventure
was
a
remarkable
one
for
it
was
years
since
he
had
failed
to
attend
sunday
morning
service
but
he
sought
no
stern
omnipotent
presence
which
his
religion
told
him
must
be
invoked
among
arches
and
altars
he
sought
maybe
the
same
under
the
guise
of
a
smiling
face
in
windy
temples
it
was
not
that
he
consciously
sought
it
as
far
as
any
formulated
expression
went
he
would
have
said
that
he
chose
to
go
for
a
walk
in
the
country
and
would
attend
cathedral
service
in
the
evening
as
usual
but
as
he
walked
he
wondered
whether
norah
would
come
to
the
cedars
that
morning
to
work
in
his
library
he
had
not
the
slightest
intention
however
reserved
and
veiled
from
himself
of
going
back
there
to
see
he
meant
to
walk
until
his
wife
and
daughter
would
certainly
be
back
from
church
again
though
probably
this
was
among
the
last
two
or
three
mornings
that
norah
would
come
to
the
cedars
at
all
for
the
catalogue
was
on
the
point
of
completion
but
he
knew
there
was
another
disposition
of
events
possible
she
had
told
him
yesterday
that
she
was
not
sure
whether
she
would
work
there
that
morning
or
not
all
the
week
her
hours
in
the
office
had
been
long
and
she
might
spend
the
morning
out
of
doors
he
knew
already
that
she
loved
the
downs
and
indeed
it
was
she
who
had
told
him
of
this
particular
path
which
he
was
now
taking
as
a
favourite
ramble
of
hers
her
brother
almost
invariably
walked
with
her
and
keeling
was
quite
innocent
of
contriving
an
accidental
meeting
with
her
alone
but
somewhere
floating
about
in
his
heart
was
the
imagined
possibility
that
she
might
be
alone
and
that
he
would
meet
her
he
did
not
expect
to
meet
her
at
all
but
he
knew
he
would
love
to
see
her
either
with
charles
or
without
swinging
along
on
this
warm
windy
morning
in
the
freedom
of
the
country
air
and
the
great
open
spaces
they
would
suit
her
but
primarily
it
was
not
she
in
any
way
that
he
sought
he
wanted
open
space
and
this
wonderful
sense
of
spring
with
its
white
bowlings
of
cloud
along
the
blue
and
its
upthrusting
of
young
grass
he
wanted
it
untrammelled
and
wild
the
tended
daffodils
and
the
buildings
of
birds
so
near
house
walls
was
not
part
of
his
mood
he
climbed
quickly
up
the
narrow
chalky
path
and
at
the
top
left
it
to
tramp
over
the
turf
here
he
was
on
an
eminence
that
commanded
miles
of
open
country
empty
and
yet
brimful
of
this
invasion
of
renewed
life
that
combed
through
him
like
a
swirl
of
through
the
thickets
of
subaqueous
weed
his
back
was
to
the
cup
of
hills
round
which
bracebridge
clustered
and
turning
round
he
looked
at
it
with
a
curious
sense
of
detachment
there
were
the
spires
of
the
cathedral
and
hardly
less
prominent
beside
them
the
cupolas
of
the
stores
he
wanted
one
as
little
as
he
wanted
the
other
and
turned
westwards
where
the
successive
lines
of
downs
stretched
away
like
waves
of
a
landless
sea
then
he
stopped
again
for
from
a
tussock
of
grass
not
fifty
yards
from
him
there
shot
up
with
throbbing
throat
and
wings
a
solitary
lark
somewhere
in
that
tussock
was
the
mate
to
whom
it
sang
quivering
and
tuneful
it
soared
now
almost
invisible
against
the
blue
but
easily
seen
again
when
a
white
cloud
rolled
up
behind
it
and
the
shadow
preceding
it
turned
the
fresh
emerald
of
the
down
grass
to
a
dark
purplish
green
at
that
the
delicate
trembling
hints
of
spring
suddenly
crystallised
in
keeling
s
heart
into
strong
definite
emotion
it
was
young
it
sang
to
its
mate
as
it
climbed
into
the
sky
soon
it
passed
altogether
out
of
his
sight
it
was
just
a
sightless
singing
out
of
the
winds
of
march
then
slowly
descending
it
appeared
again
and
its
song
grew
louder
just
before
it
dropped
into
its
tussock
of
grass
the
song
ceased
keeling
waited
quite
still
for
a
moment
and
then
came
back
into
himself
from
the
bright
places
into
which
he
had
aspired
god
there
s
no
fool
like
an
old
fool
he
said
to
himself
as
he
skirted
with
a
wide
berth
past
the
tussock
where
larks
were
nesting
the
ridge
on
which
he
walked
declined
downwards
into
a
hollow
full
of
sunshine
flecked
with
shadow
a
few
big
stood
there
still
leafless
and
the
narrow
path
with
mossy
banks
on
each
side
led
through
a
copse
of
hazel
which
had
been
felled
the
year
before
the
ground
was
covered
with
the
leaves
of
wood
anemones
and
thickly
tufted
with
the
dark
green
spears
where
in
may
the
bluebells
would
seem
like
patches
of
fallen
sky
it
was
sheltered
here
and
a
brimstone
butterfly
flitted
through
the
patches
of
sunlight
at
the
bottom
of
the
hollow
a
runnel
of
water
from
some
spring
crossed
the
path
and
babbled
into
a
cup
fringed
with
creeping
ivy
and
young
crinkled
primrose
leaves
then
the
path
rose
swiftly
upwards
again
on
the
side
of
the
next
rolling
billow
of
down
and
coming
towards
him
from
it
was
the
figure
tall
and
swiftly
moving
of
a
girl
for
a
moment
he
resented
the
fact
of
any
human
presence
here
the
next
he
heard
his
heart
creaking
in
his
throat
for
he
saw
who
it
was
by
the
time
he
recognised
her
he
too
was
recognised
and
half
way
up
the
climbing
path
they
met
she
was
carrying
her
hat
in
her
hand
and
the
sunlit
sparks
of
fire
in
her
brown
bright
hair
that
the
wind
had
disordered
into
a
wildness
that
greatly
became
her
and
the
spirit
of
the
spring
morning
her
brisk
walking
had
kindled
a
glow
in
her
cheeks
and
she
was
a
little
out
of
breath
for
she
had
run
down
the
path
from
the
crest
of
slope
beyond
standing
a
step
or
two
above
him
on
the
steep
slope
their
eyes
were
on
a
level
as
straight
as
an
arrow
s
fight
hers
looked
into
his
not
working
at
the
catalogue
then
this
morning
he
said
i
wondered
whether
you
would
or
i
meant
to
she
said
until
i
smelt
the
wind
then
it
was
impossible
i
should
not
care
if
every
book
in
the
world
was
burned
i
think
and
you
not
at
the
cathedral
this
morning
and
that
might
be
burned
too
he
said
she
laughed
i
m
a
pagan
she
said
and
so
it
appears
are
you
pan
is
sitting
somewhere
in
this
wood
did
you
hear
his
flute
no
only
the
wind
and
the
song
of
a
perhaps
that
was
he
he
s
all
over
the
place
this
you
told
me
about
pan
he
said
i
had
never
heard
of
him
well
you
heard
him
he
was
the
wind
and
the
skylark
he
always
is
if
you
know
how
to
listen
but
i
mustn
t
keep
you
you
are
going
he
looked
at
his
watch
not
deriving
any
impression
from
it
then
back
at
her
no
i
must
turn
too
he
said
mayn
t
i
walk
with
you
naturally
till
we
get
to
the
town
and
then
as
naturally
not
but
we
must
wait
in
this
hollow
a
little
longer
it
is
brimful
of
spring
look
at
the
clumps
of
bluebell
leaves
in
a
month
there
will
be
a
thick
blue
carpet
spread
which
are
the
bluebells
he
asked
she
pointed
and
then
bending
down
found
in
the
centre
of
one
the
bud
from
which
the
blossom
would
expand
i
thought
they
were
just
some
sort
of
grass
he
said
the
woods
are
covered
with
them
will
you
show
them
to
me
when
they
are
all
out
oh
mr
keeling
she
said
you
will
surely
be
able
to
see
them
for
not
so
she
rose
from
her
examination
of
the
bud
her
face
still
flushed
yes
we
ll
see
them
together
some
saturday
afternoon
then
she
said
i
won
t
have
any
hand
in
your
not
going
to
cathedral
on
sunday
morning
i
suppose
we
must
be
getting
back
what
time
was
it
when
you
looked
at
your
watch
just
now
i
forget
i
don
t
think
i
she
laughed
i
do
that
so
often
when
i
m
working
at
the
catalogue
in
the
evening
she
said
i
look
to
see
if
it
is
time
to
go
to
bed
and
then
go
on
working
there
isn
t
any
time
so
long
as
you
are
absorbed
in
they
mounted
the
steep
ascent
down
which
he
had
come
a
few
minutes
before
the
wind
was
at
their
backs
ruthlessly
blowing
them
towards
bracebridge
and
there
s
the
opening
of
the
hospital
wing
she
said
i
suppose
you
won
t
be
at
the
office
in
the
morning
at
all
i
shall
just
look
in
he
said
will
you
come
to
the
opening
and
to
the
lunch
afterwards
with
your
brother
there
is
a
table
for
some
dozen
of
my
i
am
sure
we
should
both
like
to
i
love
ceremonies
and
gold
chains
and
personages
i
ve
been
visiting
at
the
hospital
too
reading
to
have
you
you
never
told
me
it
wasn
t
particularly
interesting
but
i
am
so
sorry
for
people
in
hospital
i
shall
take
a
basket
of
bluebells
there
one
day
only
it
makes
me
feel
cheap
to
read
for
an
hour
on
saturday
afternoon
or
pick
some
flowers
it
is
so
little
and
yet
what
more
can
i
do
if
i
were
rich
i
would
spend
thousands
on
he
was
silent
a
moment
is
that
remark
made
to
me
he
asked
i
suppose
it
is
just
a
little
bit
it
was
very
i
do
subscribe
to
it
you
know
he
said
oh
yes
i
saw
your
name
among
the
subscribers
when
i
was
there
yesterday
she
said
rather
hurriedly
keeling
felt
a
keen
and
secret
enjoyment
over
this
he
knew
quite
well
what
she
must
have
seen
namely
the
fact
that
he
was
a
yearly
subscriber
of
as
set
forth
on
the
subscription
board
he
had
no
temptation
whatever
to
tell
her
who
was
the
anonymous
donor
of
the
new
wing
she
would
hear
that
and
in
the
meantime
would
continue
to
consider
him
the
donor
of
a
year
he
liked
that
he
did
not
want
any
curtailment
of
it
and
no
one
knows
who
the
giver
of
the
new
wing
is
she
asked
i
fancy
lord
inverbroom
does
he
replied
secretly
praising
himself
for
his
remarkable
ingenuity
i
enjoyed
that
afternoon
i
spent
there
she
said
they
are
kind
they
are
simple
and
it
is
only
simple
people
who
count
i
wonder
if
lord
inverbroom
gave
the
wing
ah
that
had
not
occurred
to
me
said
keeling
this
served
his
purpose
clearly
no
suspicion
of
being
tricked
by
an
ingenious
answer
crossed
the
girl
s
mind
and
she
paused
a
moment
shielding
her
eyes
with
her
hand
and
looking
towards
bracebridge
that
shelter
from
the
sun
concealed
all
her
face
but
her
mouth
and
looking
at
her
he
thought
that
if
her
mouth
alone
was
visible
of
her
he
could
have
picked
it
out
as
hers
among
a
thousand
others
the
full
upper
lip
was
the
slightest
degree
irregular
it
drooped
a
little
on
the
right
falling
over
the
join
with
the
lower
lip
it
was
as
if
it
was
infinitesimally
swollen
there
for
one
second
of
stinging
desire
he
longed
to
shut
down
her
hand
over
her
eyes
and
kiss
that
corner
of
her
mouth
it
must
have
been
that
about
which
the
skylark
sang
they
had
come
near
to
the
end
of
the
ridge
where
the
steep
descent
on
to
the
road
began
fifty
yards
in
front
at
present
unnoticed
by
him
was
the
tussock
out
of
which
the
bird
had
risen
and
even
as
they
paused
she
looking
at
bracebridge
and
he
at
her
that
carolling
and
jubilation
began
again
at
once
she
put
down
her
shielding
hand
and
laid
it
on
his
sleeve
as
if
he
could
not
hear
there
s
your
lark
she
whispered
she
did
not
move
while
the
song
continued
her
hand
still
rested
unconsciously
on
his
sleeve
her
eyes
looked
straight
at
him
demanding
his
companionship
in
that
young
joy
of
life
that
thrilled
her
no
less
than
the
bird
it
was
that
in
the
main
that
possessed
her
and
yet
for
that
delicate
intimate
moment
she
had
instinctively
so
instinctively
that
she
was
unaware
of
her
choice
chosen
him
as
her
companion
she
wanted
to
listen
to
the
lark
with
him
or
his
coat
on
her
her
whole
soul
was
steeped
in
the
joyful
hour
and
it
was
with
him
she
shared
it
it
was
theirs
not
hers
alone
the
song
grew
faint
and
louder
again
then
ceased
and
she
took
her
hand
off
his
arm
thanks
she
said
they
made
a
wide
circuit
round
that
windy
home
of
melody
and
now
which
of
us
shall
go
first
she
said
for
we
must
go
alone
now
which
of
us
naturally
walks
fastest
you
i
expect
so
i
shall
sit
here
for
five
minutes
more
and
then
he
agreed
to
this
and
strode
off
down
the
steep
descent
just
before
he
was
out
of
sight
he
turned
to
wave
a
hand
at
her
then
she
was
alone
on
the
great
empty
down
still
hatless
still
flushed
with
wind
and
walking
and
just
behind
her
the
tussock
where
the
lark
lived
he
found
a
note
for
himself
on
the
hall
table
and
with
it
in
his
hand
walked
into
his
wife
s
room
to
see
if
she
had
returned
from
church
she
was
already
there
resting
a
little
after
the
fatigue
of
worship
and
extremely
voluble
so
you
are
back
too
thomas
she
said
and
what
a
pity
you
did
not
get
back
sooner
lord
inverbroom
has
just
called
and
left
a
note
for
you
i
wonder
you
did
not
see
him
in
the
cathedral
for
he
went
to
service
there
i
said
you
always
took
a
walk
on
sunday
morning
after
service
so
sooner
than
wait
he
wrote
a
note
for
you
oh
you
have
it
in
your
hand
what
a
curious
handwriting
his
is
i
should
have
thought
a
spider
from
the
could
have
done
better
than
that
but
no
doubt
you
will
be
able
to
make
it
out
of
course
i
asked
him
to
stop
to
lunch
for
whether
we
are
alone
or
expect
company
i
m
sure
my
table
is
good
enough
for
anybody
alice
will
not
be
here
she
has
gone
to
lunch
with
mr
oh
is
that
quite
proper
not
alone
my
dear
what
do
you
take
me
for
i
hope
i
know
what
is
proper
and
what
is
not
his
sister
has
come
to
stay
with
him
a
most
ladylike
sort
of
person
you
might
almost
say
distinguished
she
and
alice
made
great
friends
instantly
i
declare
you
would
have
thought
they
were
sisters
instead
of
the
two
silverdales
they
were
my
dear
to
each
other
before
they
had
talked
for
five
minutes
i
thought
it
quite
an
of
what
asked
he
why
of
their
becoming
sisters
i
am
no
thank
god
but
really
the
way
in
which
mr
silverdale
introduced
his
sister
to
alice
why
i
have
never
seen
anything
like
it
this
is
my
helper
margaret
he
said
or
perhaps
it
was
martha
i
could
not
quite
catch
the
name
this
is
my
dear
helper
that
was
it
and
i
couldn
t
do
without
what
do
you
say
to
that
i
don
t
say
anything
at
all
my
dear
he
said
mr
silverdale
has
said
it
too
ah
but
the
tone
there
is
so
much
in
the
tone
said
this
excruciating
lady
how
very
odd
it
would
be
to
hear
a
clergyman
give
out
his
own
i
should
think
it
remarkably
odd
if
they
were
alice
s
too
said
keeling
well
and
i
dare
say
it
won
t
be
long
before
you
are
finely
surprised
then
pray
tell
me
what
lord
inverbroom
says
i
am
sure
it
is
about
the
opening
of
the
hospital
i
have
practised
my
royal
curtsey
i
can
get
down
and
up
quite
easily
indeed
mamma
thought
it
most
graceful
and
she
does
not
praise
without
reason
perhaps
lord
inverbroom
wants
me
to
come
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
steps
and
make
my
curtsey
there
if
he
insists
of
course
i
will
do
it
for
naturally
he
knows
more
about
court
etiquette
than
i
do
at
present
i
will
certainly
bow
to
his
superior
keeling
stood
there
with
his
letter
still
unopened
half
an
hour
ago
he
had
been
with
norah
listening
to
the
skylark
on
the
downs
now
on
the
pink
clock
in
front
of
him
hung
the
quaint
spider
s
web
which
jane
had
been
most
careful
about
he
felt
as
if
he
was
caught
there
or
it
may
be
about
the
bouquet
continued
his
wife
very
likely
he
has
found
out
that
the
princess
has
some
favourite
flower
in
which
case
it
would
be
only
right
to
have
it
made
of
that
instead
of
carnations
and
and
i
could
say
your
favourite
flower
your
royal
highness
or
something
of
the
sort
pray
open
your
letter
thomas
and
see
what
it
keeling
found
no
difficulty
in
deciphering
the
handwriting
there
were
three
pages
and
glancing
through
them
he
moved
towards
the
door
nothing
whatever
about
the
ceremony
he
said
he
went
to
his
library
and
gave
a
more
detailed
perusal
to
what
lord
inverbroom
had
to
say
it
was
a
disagreeable
letter
to
read
and
he
felt
that
the
writing
of
it
had
been
disagreeable
to
its
author
it
informed
him
that
since
lord
inverbroom
had
put
his
name
up
for
election
into
the
county
club
he
had
become
aware
that
there
were
a
considerable
number
of
members
who
would
certainly
vote
against
his
election
lord
inverbroom
had
spoken
to
various
of
these
but
had
not
succeeded
in
mitigating
their
opposition
and
was
afraid
that
his
candidate
would
certainly
not
be
elected
in
these
circumstances
did
mr
keeling
wish
him
to
withdraw
his
name
or
not
he
would
be
entirely
guided
by
his
wishes
he
added
a
very
simple
and
sincere
expression
of
his
regret
at
the
course
events
had
taken
keeling
read
this
through
once
and
once
again
before
he
passed
to
the
consideration
of
the
answer
he
would
make
to
it
he
found
that
it
said
very
disagreeable
things
inoffensively
which
seemed
to
him
a
feat
knowing
that
if
he
wrote
a
letter
containing
disagreeable
news
the
tone
of
his
letter
would
be
disagreeable
also
he
could
not
quite
understand
how
it
was
done
but
certainly
he
felt
no
kind
of
offence
towards
the
writer
but
the
contents
were
another
matter
and
they
both
annoyed
him
excessively
and
kindled
in
him
a
blaze
of
defiance
he
would
much
have
liked
to
know
who
were
these
members
for
whom
he
was
not
good
enough
and
whose
opposition
lord
inverbroom
had
been
unable
to
mitigate
but
as
far
as
withdrawing
his
candidature
went
for
fear
of
the
result
of
the
election
or
acquainting
lord
inverbroom
of
the
fact
that
as
purchaser
of
the
property
he
had
the
privilege
of
being
a
member
such
craven
notions
never
entered
his
head
if
sufficient
members
to
secure
his
rejection
objected
to
him
they
should
record
their
objections
he
was
not
going
to
withdraw
on
the
chance
of
their
doing
so
he
had
never
yet
abandoned
a
business
proposition
for
fear
of
competition
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
to
withdraw
his
name
was
somehow
parallel
to
being
frightened
out
of
a
deal
judging
from
the
purely
business
standpoint
and
there
was
his
mistake
he
expected
to
find
that
a
large
quantity
of
this
supposed
opposition
was
bluff
besides
before
the
election
came
on
it
would
be
known
who
had
given
the
new
wing
to
the
hospital
and
pulled
the
committee
out
of
a
quagmire
of
rotten
finance
it
would
be
known
too
that
whether
the
county
club
thought
him
a
suitable
occupant
of
the
that
looked
on
alfred
street
his
sovereign
thought
him
good
enough
to
go
into
dinner
before
any
of
them
except
lord
inverbroom
he
was
no
snob
himself
but
he
suspected
that
a
good
many
other
people
were
accordingly
even
before
the
gong
sounded
for
lunch
he
had
finished
a
note
in
answer
to
lord
inverbroom
s
as
follows
dear
lord
inverbroom
i
am
obliged
for
your
favour
just
to
hand
and
regret
i
was
out
i
should
be
obliged
if
you
would
kindly
fulfil
the
engagement
you
entered
into
with
me
and
put
me
up
for
election
as
agreed
i
do
not
in
the
least
fear
the
result
of
the
election
and
so
trust
you
may
be
in
error
about
it
faithfully
yours
thomas
this
he
read
through
before
posting
it
it
was
a
sound
business
letter
saying
just
what
it
set
out
to
say
but
he
wondered
why
it
lacked
that
certain
aroma
of
courtesy
which
distinguished
the
letter
which
it
answered
he
perceived
that
it
was
so
but
no
more
knew
how
to
remedy
it
than
he
knew
how
to
fly
but
he
could
walk
pretty
sturdily
along
the
ground
and
it
required
a
stalwart
push
to
upset
him
and
if
the
undesirable
happened
and
lord
inverbroom
s
fears
proved
to
be
well
founded
he
knew
he
had
a
sound
knock
ready
for
the
whole
assembly
of
those
who
collectively
thought
he
was
not
good
enough
for
them
i
ll
find
an
answer
that
s
good
enough
for
them
he
said
to
himself
as
he
slipped
the
letter
into
his
in
spite
of
her
practice
in
the
conduct
of
social
functions
as
lady
mayoress
and
her
natural
aptitude
for
knowing
how
to
behave
suitably
mrs
keeling
had
one
moment
of
extremest
terror
when
the
royal
princess
came
up
the
steps
of
the
hospital
next
day
between
keeling
and
lord
inverbroom
to
where
the
lady
mayoress
awaited
her
her
knees
so
trembled
that
though
she
felt
that
there
would
not
be
the
smallest
difficulty
in
sinking
down
in
the
curtsey
or
indeed
in
sinking
into
the
earth
altogether
she
much
doubted
her
power
of
ever
raising
herself
again
and
the
gypsophila
in
the
bouquet
she
was
about
to
present
shook
so
violently
that
it
appeared
to
be
but
a
gray
mist
among
the
daffodils
which
had
been
ascertained
to
be
the
princess
s
favourite
flower
she
would
have
liked
to
run
away
but
there
was
nowhere
to
run
to
and
indeed
the
gorgeous
heaviness
of
her
satin
gown
rendered
all
active
locomotion
impossible
then
her
royal
highness
shook
her
hand
thanked
her
for
the
beautiful
flowers
and
inhaled
the
perfume
of
the
scentless
daffodils
before
giving
them
to
her
to
carry
and
mrs
keeling
found
herself
able
to
say
your
favourite
flowers
your
royal
highness
which
broke
the
spell
of
her
terror
then
followed
the
declaration
that
the
new
wing
was
open
and
the
tour
was
made
through
the
empty
wards
while
mrs
keeling
so
swelled
with
pride
and
anticipation
that
she
felt
that
it
was
she
who
had
been
the
yet
anonymous
benefactor
sometimes
she
talked
to
the
princess
sometimes
only
to
lord
inverbroom
or
was
even
so
mindful
of
her
proper
place
as
to
drop
a
condescending
word
or
two
to
the
bishop
whose
only
there
so
she
considered
was
that
he
would
presently
be
permitted
to
say
grace
lining
the
big
hall
and
in
corridors
were
the
common
people
of
bracebridge
mrs
fyson
and
that
class
of
person
and
naturally
mrs
keeling
swept
by
them
as
she
had
swept
by
the
footmen
on
that
pleasant
domestic
evening
at
lady
inverbroom
s
then
came
the
lunch
in
the
near
by
at
which
the
bishop
did
his
duty
and
the
guests
theirs
there
was
a
table
and
a
raised
dais
for
the
principal
of
those
and
on
the
floor
of
the
hall
a
dozen
others
for
the
less
distinguished
close
by
against
the
wall
were
sitting
those
of
keeling
s
staff
who
had
been
bidden
to
the
ceremony
and
he
had
already
satisfied
himself
that
norah
was
there
then
at
the
close
of
lunch
came
lord
inverbroom
s
speech
and
at
the
close
of
that
the
sentence
for
which
mrs
keeling
had
been
waiting
your
royal
highness
he
said
and
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
will
now
ask
you
to
drink
the
health
of
the
munificent
benefactor
whose
name
by
his
express
desire
has
till
now
remained
a
secret
i
ask
you
to
drink
the
health
of
our
most
honoured
mayor
mr
thomas
then
followed
the
usual
acclamation
and
it
was
sweet
to
the
donor
s
ears
but
sweeter
than
it
all
to
him
was
the
moment
when
as
the
guests
sat
down
again
and
he
rose
to
reply
he
looked
across
at
the
table
near
the
wall
and
caught
norah
s
eye
just
perceptibly
she
shook
her
head
at
him
as
if
to
reproach
him
with
his
ingeniousness
the
day
before
but
all
her
face
was
alight
he
had
never
met
so
radiant
an
encounter
from
her
mrs
keeling
was
almost
too
superb
to
speak
even
to
lord
inverbroom
in
the
interval
after
lunch
when
presentations
were
made
before
the
princess
drove
to
the
station
again
but
she
could
not
continue
not
to
speak
to
anybody
any
more
because
of
this
great
exaltation
and
she
was
full
of
bright
things
as
she
went
home
with
her
husband
it
really
all
passed
off
very
tolerably
she
said
do
you
not
think
so
my
dear
and
was
it
not
gratifying
just
as
the
dear
princess
shook
hands
with
me
for
the
second
time
before
she
drove
away
holding
my
hand
quite
a
long
time
she
said
and
i
hear
your
friends
will
not
call
you
mrs
keeling
very
much
was
not
that
delicately
put
how
common
lady
inverbroom
looked
beside
her
but
after
all
we
can
t
all
be
princesses
i
was
told
by
the
who
was
a
very
civil
sort
of
woman
indeed
that
her
royal
highness
was
going
to
stay
with
the
poor
inverbrooms
next
month
i
can
hardly
believe
that
i
should
not
think
it
was
at
all
a
likely
sort
of
thing
to
happen
but
i
felt
i
really
ought
to
warn
mrs
i
did
not
quite
catch
her
name
what
a
very
poor
sort
of
dinner
her
mistress
would
get
if
she
fared
no
better
than
we
did
but
we
must
keep
our
ears
open
next
month
to
find
out
if
it
really
does
happen
though
i
dare
say
we
shall
be
the
first
to
know
for
after
lady
inverbroom
could
scarcely
fail
to
ask
us
to
dine
and
sleep
i
can
not
conceive
why
she
should
do
any
such
thing
remarked
keeling
my
dear
you
are
too
modest
you
may
be
sure
lady
inverbroom
would
be
only
too
glad
to
get
somebody
to
interest
and
amuse
the
princess
for
she
has
no
great
fund
of
wit
and
ability
herself
i
saw
the
princess
laughing
three
times
at
something
you
said
to
her
and
i
dare
say
i
missed
other
occasions
did
you
see
her
pearls
certainly
they
were
very
fine
and
i
m
sure
we
can
take
it
for
granted
they
were
genuine
but
i
saw
none
among
them
and
i
had
a
good
look
at
them
before
and
behind
that
would
match
my
pearl
they
drove
on
a
little
way
in
silence
for
mrs
keeling
s
utterance
got
a
little
choked
up
with
pride
and
gratification
like
a
congested
gutter
and
in
all
her
husband
s
mental
equipment
there
was
nothing
that
could
be
responsive
to
these
futilities
they
evoked
nothing
whatever
in
him
he
had
not
the
soil
from
which
they
sprang
which
mrs
keeling
had
carted
into
her
own
psychical
garden
in
such
abundance
since
she
had
become
lady
mayoress
besides
for
the
present
there
was
nothing
real
to
him
not
the
lunch
not
the
public
recognition
not
the
impending
club
election
except
that
moment
when
he
had
fixed
norah
s
glance
drawn
it
to
himself
as
on
an
imperishable
thread
across
the
crowded
rooms
when
he
rose
to
reply
he
almost
wished
his
wife
would
go
on
talking
again
her
babble
seemed
to
build
a
wall
round
him
which
cutting
him
off
by
its
inanity
from
other
topics
that
might
engage
him
left
him
alone
with
norah
very
soon
his
wish
was
fully
gratified
how
one
frightens
oneself
for
no
reason
she
said
i
declare
when
the
princess
came
up
the
steps
i
was
ready
to
run
away
but
it
all
passed
in
a
moment
and
by
the
time
i
had
said
your
favourite
flowers
ma
am
did
i
tell
you
i
said
your
favourite
flowers
ma
am
and
she
gave
me
such
a
sweet
smile
i
felt
as
if
i
had
known
her
for
years
there
are
some
sorts
of
people
with
whom
i
feel
at
home
at
once
and
that
was
how
i
felt
this
morning
it
must
be
very
pleasant
always
to
go
about
such
people
and
i
declare
i
quite
envied
her
though
if
i
was
she
i
should
certainly
have
something
done
to
my
teeth
i
must
run
round
and
see
mamma
this
afternoon
and
i
should
not
wonder
if
i
paid
a
few
calls
as
well
for
i
am
sure
everybody
will
be
pining
to
know
what
the
princess
said
all
the
time
we
were
having
a
talk
together
over
our
coffee
i
must
try
to
recollect
every
word
of
that
though
i
am
sure
i
shall
find
difficulty
in
doing
so
for
we
chattered
away
as
if
we
had
known
each
other
all
our
i
dare
say
you
will
recollect
it
very
well
my
dear
said
he
if
you
give
your
mind
to
it
and
if
you
can
not
remember
you
can
make
it
well
if
that
isn
t
a
rude
speech
but
perhaps
you
re
tired
thomas
with
all
this
grandeur
for
me
i
never
felt
fresher
in
my
life
it
comes
quite
natural
to
no
i
am
not
the
least
tired
he
said
as
soon
as
i
have
changed
my
clothes
i
shall
go
down
to
my
pray
leave
that
for
another
day
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
your
demeaning
yourself
with
business
after
what
we
have
been
doing
i
do
not
think
it
is
quite
respectful
to
the
suddenly
the
babble
that
he
had
rather
welcomed
became
intolerable
it
had
cut
him
off
from
the
world
as
if
some
thick
swarm
of
flies
had
settled
outside
the
window
utterly
obscuring
the
outlook
now
in
a
moment
the
window
seemed
to
have
been
opened
and
they
swarmed
in
buzzing
about
and
settling
on
him
and
where
should
we
have
been
if
i
hadn
t
demeaned
myself
with
business
he
asked
didn
t
the
new
wing
of
the
hospital
and
your
pearl
pendant
and
your
chatting
like
an
old
friend
to
a
princess
all
come
out
of
my
demeaning
myself
mrs
keeling
paid
no
attention
to
this
she
hardly
heard
and
if
she
does
come
to
stay
with
the
inverbrooms
she
said
i
have
no
doubt
she
will
express
a
wish
to
take
lunch
with
us
we
must
see
about
getting
a
butler
thomas
parkinson
is
a
good
servant
but
i
should
not
like
it
to
be
known
at
court
that
i
only
kept
a
parlour
the
carriage
had
stopped
at
the
gothic
porch
and
keeling
got
out
i
will
promise
to
let
you
have
twenty
butlers
on
the
day
she
lunches
with
us
he
said
come
get
out
emmeline
and
take
care
how
you
walk
there
s
something
gone
to
your
head
it
may
be
champagne
or
it
may
be
the
princess
i
suspect
it
s
the
princess
and
you
re
intoxicated
go
indoors
and
sleep
it
off
and
let
me
find
you
sober
at
take
my
my
dear
what
things
you
say
i
am
ashamed
of
you
though
i
know
it
s
only
your
fun
the
carriage
must
wait
for
me
i
shall
pay
a
call
or
two
and
then
take
a
drive
through
the
town
i
think
the
citizens
would
feel
it
to
be
my
duty
to
do
keeling
found
that
norah
had
got
back
to
his
office
when
he
arrived
and
was
busy
at
the
typewriting
of
the
letters
he
had
dictated
to
her
that
morning
she
was
in
the
little
room
opening
off
his
and
the
door
was
shut
but
her
presence
was
indicated
by
the
muffled
clacking
of
her
machine
that
sound
was
infinitely
more
real
to
him
than
what
he
thought
of
as
the
flummeries
of
the
day
and
he
was
far
more
interested
in
how
she
would
take
the
divulging
of
the
donor
s
name
than
how
all
the
rest
of
the
town
would
take
it
the
significance
which
it
held
for
him
on
account
of
the
honour
that
would
come
to
him
or
on
account
of
this
matter
of
his
election
to
the
club
mattered
nothing
in
comparison
to
how
she
took
it
he
was
determined
to
make
no
allusion
to
it
himself
he
would
leave
it
to
her
to
state
the
revision
of
her
views
about
his
support
of
the
hospital
while
he
waited
for
the
completion
of
her
work
he
occupied
himself
with
businesses
that
demanded
his
scrutiny
but
all
the
while
his
ear
was
pricked
to
listen
to
the
sound
of
her
typewriting
machine
or
rather
to
listen
for
the
silence
of
its
cessation
for
that
would
mean
that
norah
would
presently
come
in
with
the
letters
for
his
signature
there
was
nothing
in
his
work
that
demanded
a
close
grip
of
his
mind
and
beneath
the
mechanical
attention
that
he
gave
it
memory
like
some
undertow
was
flowing
on
its
own
course
past
the
hidden
subaqueous
landscape
there
was
a
whole
stretch
of
scenery
there
out
of
sight
of
the
surface
of
his
life
till
she
had
come
into
it
there
was
no
man
who
possessed
less
of
a
secret
history
he
had
his
hobby
of
books
as
all
the
world
knew
his
blameless
domestic
conduct
his
hard
puritan
morality
and
religion
his
integrity
and
success
in
and
keen
business
faculty
that
was
all
there
was
to
him
but
now
he
had
dived
below
that
yet
without
making
any
break
in
the
surface
all
that
he
had
done
and
been
before
continued
its
uninterrupted
course
his
life
beneath
the
deep
waters
did
not
make
itself
known
by
as
much
as
a
bubble
coming
to
the
surface
gradually
while
still
his
ear
was
alert
to
catch
the
silence
next
door
which
would
show
that
norah
had
finished
her
work
his
moved
more
slowly
and
drowsily
the
page
he
was
reading
concerning
some
estimate
lay
long
unturned
before
him
and
his
eye
ceased
to
travel
along
the
lines
that
no
longer
conveyed
any
meaning
to
him
it
was
not
the
ceremony
of
that
occupied
him
nor
the
moment
when
all
bracebridge
knew
that
it
was
he
who
had
made
this
munificent
gift
those
things
formed
but
the
vaguest
of
backgrounds
in
which
too
a
veiled
hatred
of
his
wife
was
mingled
in
front
of
that
grey
mist
was
the
sunlit
windy
down
the
skylark
the
tufts
of
foliage
and
the
companionship
which
gave
them
all
their
significance
and
how
significant
he
now
asked
himself
were
these
same
things
to
his
companion
did
they
mean
anything
to
her
because
of
him
true
she
had
silently
and
unconsciously
taken
him
into
her
confidence
when
they
listened
together
to
the
song
but
would
not
anybody
else
her
brother
for
instance
have
done
just
as
well
did
her
heart
want
him
he
had
no
answer
to
that
and
what
if
it
was
possible
to
introduce
the
hard
angles
of
practical
issues
into
these
suffused
dimnesses
was
to
be
the
end
or
even
the
continuation
of
this
critical
yet
completely
uneventful
history
all
the
conduct
the
habit
the
traditions
of
his
life
were
in
utter
discord
with
it
if
he
looked
at
it
even
as
far
as
it
had
gone
in
the
hard
dry
light
which
hitherto
had
guided
him
in
his
life
he
could
hardly
think
it
credible
that
it
was
the
case
of
thomas
keeling
which
was
under
his
scrutiny
but
even
more
unconjecturable
was
the
outcome
he
could
see
no
path
of
any
sort
ahead
if
by
some
chance
momentous
revelation
he
knew
that
she
wanted
him
with
that
quality
of
wanting
which
was
his
what
would
happen
his
whole
reasonable
and
upright
self
revolted
from
the
idea
of
clandestine
intrigue
and
with
hardly
less
emphasis
did
it
reject
the
idea
of
an
honest
open
and
deplorable
of
his
reputation
and
respectability
he
could
not
really
contemplate
either
course
but
of
the
two
the
first
was
a
shade
the
farther
away
from
the
confines
of
possibility
and
if
some
similar
revelation
told
him
that
he
was
nothing
to
norah
beyond
a
kind
just
employer
with
certain
tastes
and
perceptions
akin
to
her
own
there
was
no
path
there
either
he
could
not
see
how
to
proceed
but
he
experienced
no
sense
of
in
having
got
himself
into
this
impossible
place
it
had
not
been
his
fault
only
those
who
were
quite
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
love
could
blame
him
for
loving
a
fish
who
did
not
need
the
air
might
as
well
say
to
a
drowning
man
it
is
quite
unnecessary
to
breathe
you
have
only
to
make
a
determined
effort
and
convince
yourself
that
you
needn
t
breathe
look
at
me
i
don
t
breathe
and
i
swim
about
in
the
utmost
comfort
it
is
very
wrong
to
breathe
then
suddenly
all
surmise
and
speculation
was
expunged
from
his
mind
for
no
longer
the
clack
of
the
typewriting
machine
came
from
next
door
he
heard
the
stir
of
a
chair
pushed
back
and
the
rattle
of
a
door
handle
norah
was
coming
who
was
of
greater
concern
than
all
his
thoughts
about
her
and
he
was
going
to
give
her
no
quarter
she
would
have
to
introduce
the
subject
of
her
feelings
with
regard
to
his
niggardly
herself
he
knew
something
of
her
pride
from
the
affair
of
the
and
he
longed
to
see
her
take
that
armour
off
he
looked
rather
grimly
at
his
watch
you
are
rather
late
he
said
apparently
the
was
not
to
be
taken
off
just
yet
she
answered
him
as
she
had
not
answered
him
for
many
weeks
i
am
afraid
i
am
sir
she
said
but
you
kindly
invited
me
to
go
to
the
luncheon
and
the
opening
of
the
new
wing
i
have
been
working
ever
he
delighted
in
her
in
the
astonishing
irony
of
her
calling
him
sir
again
he
had
deserved
it
too
for
he
had
spoken
to
her
with
the
old
office
manner
have
you
them
ready
for
me
now
he
asked
keeping
the
farce
up
yes
sir
they
only
want
your
he
drew
the
sheets
towards
him
and
began
signing
in
silence
wondering
when
she
proposed
to
say
how
sorry
she
was
for
misjudging
him
about
his
generosity
surely
he
could
not
have
misinterpreted
that
radiant
glance
she
gave
him
when
he
rose
to
reply
to
the
toast
of
his
health
she
had
gone
back
for
a
moment
into
her
room
to
fetch
the
pile
of
directed
envelopes
which
she
had
forgotten
most
injudiciously
he
allowed
himself
a
swift
glance
at
her
as
she
and
saw
beyond
doubt
that
the
corners
of
her
mouth
were
twitching
that
her
eyes
danced
with
some
merriment
that
she
could
not
completely
control
his
own
face
was
better
in
command
and
he
knew
he
wore
his
grimmest
aspect
as
he
continued
glancing
through
her
typed
letters
and
scrawling
his
name
at
the
foot
as
usual
she
took
each
sheet
from
him
blotted
it
and
put
it
into
its
envelope
she
always
refused
to
use
the
little
piece
of
damped
sponge
for
the
gumming
of
the
envelopes
but
employed
the
tip
of
her
tongue
is
that
all
he
said
when
he
had
gone
through
the
pile
yes
he
rose
had
he
been
wrong
about
the
glance
he
had
got
from
her
if
so
he
might
have
been
wrong
in
everything
that
concerned
her
from
the
first
day
of
her
appearance
here
i
shall
be
getting
home
then
he
said
at
the
door
he
turned
back
again
once
more
she
had
beaten
him
look
here
miss
propert
he
said
there
s
enough
of
she
laughed
straight
out
oh
i
am
so
glad
you
said
that
she
said
i
was
going
to
let
you
turn
the
before
i
he
put
down
his
hat
again
oh
you
were
were
you
he
said
well
what
were
you
going
to
say
when
i
did
turn
the
i
think
you
are
rather
brutal
she
said
you
don
t
help
me
out
at
not
an
atom
he
said
you
know
quite
well
first
i
was
going
to
apologise
for
all
the
thoughts
that
had
ever
been
in
my
mind
about
you
and
the
hospital
i
was
an
utter
fool
not
to
have
known
that
you
were
the
most
generous
he
interrupted
her
never
mind
but
i
do
mind
that
it
was
idiotic
of
me
and
it
was
ungrateful
of
me
i
should
have
known
you
better
than
she
came
a
step
closer
will
you
forgive
me
she
said
i
adored
that
moment
when
your
name
was
announced
i
felt
so
proud
of
serving
he
held
out
his
hand
that
is
very
friendly
of
you
he
said
but
we
are
friends
aren
t
we
and
again
she
looked
at
him
with
that
brightness
and
radiance
in
her
face
that
he
had
seen
once
before
only
chapter
ix
it
is
perhaps
hardly
necessary
to
state
that
mrs
keeling
on
the
eve
of
the
ceremony
for
the
opening
of
the
keeling
wing
had
subscribed
to
a
press
cutting
agency
which
would
furnish
her
with
innumerable
accounts
of
all
she
knew
so
well
but
print
was
an
even
more
substantial
joy
than
memory
and
there
appeared
in
the
local
press
the
most
gratifying
panegyrics
on
her
husband
these
were
delightful
enough
but
most
of
all
she
loved
the
account
of
herself
at
that
monumental
moment
when
she
presented
the
princess
with
the
bouquet
of
daffodils
and
gypsophila
she
was
never
tired
of
the
perusal
of
this
nor
of
the
snapshot
which
some
fortunate
photographer
had
taken
of
her
in
the
very
middle
of
her
royal
curtsey
as
she
was
actually
handing
the
bouquet
this
was
reproduced
several
times
she
framed
one
copy
and
kept
all
the
rest
with
the
exception
of
one
with
regard
to
which
she
screwed
herself
up
to
the
point
of
generosity
that
was
necessary
before
she
could
prevail
on
herself
to
send
it
to
her
mother
then
while
still
the
industrious
had
not
yet
come
to
the
end
of
those
appetising
morsels
the
packets
on
her
breakfast
table
swelled
in
size
again
and
she
was
privileged
to
read
over
and
over
again
that
the
honour
of
a
baronetcy
had
been
conferred
on
her
husband
she
did
not
mind
how
often
she
read
this
all
the
london
papers
reproduced
the
gratifying
intelligence
and
though
the
wording
in
most
of
these
was
absolutely
identical
repetition
never
caused
the
sweet
savour
to
cloy
on
her
palate
she
was
like
a
girl
revelling
in
though
they
all
tasted
precisely
alike
each
tasted
delicious
and
she
felt
she
could
go
on
eating
them
for
ever
even
better
than
those
stately
clippings
from
the
great
london
luminaries
were
the
more
detailed
coruscations
of
the
local
press
they
gave
biographies
of
her
husband
magnanimously
suppressing
the
and
dwelling
only
on
the
enterprise
which
had
made
and
the
success
which
had
crowned
the
stores
and
many
these
were
the
sweetest
of
all
gave
details
about
herself
and
her
parentage
and
the
number
of
her
children
she
was
not
habitually
a
great
reader
only
using
books
as
a
soporific
till
they
tumbled
from
her
drowsy
grasp
but
now
she
became
a
wakeful
and
enthusiastic
student
the
whole
range
of
literature
since
the
days
of
primeval
epics
had
never
roused
in
her
one
tithe
of
the
emotion
that
those
clippings
afforded
keeling
himself
had
no
such
craving
to
see
in
print
all
that
he
was
perfectly
well
aware
of
and
even
looked
undazzled
at
the
cards
which
his
wife
had
ordered
on
one
set
of
which
he
appeared
alone
as
sir
thomas
keeling
to
differentiate
him
from
mere
knights
whilst
on
the
other
the
bart
appeared
in
conjunction
with
her
but
the
events
themselves
filled
him
with
a
good
deal
of
solid
satisfaction
due
largely
to
their
bearing
on
the
approaching
election
at
the
county
club
never
from
a
business
point
of
view
had
there
been
a
more
successful
timing
of
an
enterprise
it
was
as
if
on
the
very
day
of
his
getting
out
his
summer
fashions
summer
had
come
with
floods
of
hot
sunshine
that
made
irresistible
to
the
ladies
of
bracebridge
the
muslins
and
organdies
and
foulards
that
floated
diaphanously
in
the
freshly
dressed
windows
the
summer
of
his
munificence
and
his
honours
had
just
burst
on
the
town
and
in
spite
of
lord
inverbroom
s
warning
he
felt
as
he
walked
down
to
his
office
on
the
morning
of
the
day
on
which
the
election
took
place
that
every
member
of
the
club
would
be
so
to
speak
a
customer
for
his
presence
in
future
in
those
staid
during
these
months
of
his
mayoralty
he
had
come
into
contact
with
and
had
been
at
civic
functions
the
host
of
a
quantity
of
members
of
the
county
club
whose
suffrages
he
sought
and
there
was
none
among
them
who
had
not
shown
him
courtesy
and
even
deference
that
no
doubt
was
largely
due
to
his
position
as
mayor
but
this
thomas
keeling
who
was
a
candidate
for
the
club
was
the
mayor
he
who
had
given
the
new
wing
to
the
hospital
thereby
averting
a
very
unpleasant
financial
mess
he
too
whom
his
king
had
delighted
to
honour
to
the
business
mind
nothing
could
have
happened
more
opportunely
and
the
business
mind
was
his
mind
he
could
not
see
how
he
could
fail
after
this
bouquet
of
benefits
and
honours
to
be
an
attractive
proposition
to
any
club
as
he
walked
down
to
his
office
that
morning
he
swept
the
cobweb
of
lord
inverbroom
s
apprehensions
away
and
wondered
at
himself
for
having
allowed
them
to
infect
him
with
a
moment
s
uneasiness
or
to
make
him
consider
even
at
the
very
back
of
his
brain
what
he
should
do
if
he
were
not
elected
this
morning
he
did
not
consider
that
at
all
he
was
sure
that
the
contingency
for
which
he
had
provided
would
not
arrive
the
provision
was
filed
away
and
with
it
shut
up
in
the
dusty
volume
was
the
suggestion
his
agent
had
made
that
he
might
quite
reasonably
raise
the
rent
that
the
club
paid
for
the
premises
which
were
now
his
property
that
business
was
just
concluded
he
proposed
to
inform
lord
inverbroom
at
once
of
the
fact
that
he
was
now
the
landlord
of
the
county
club
and
that
the
question
of
a
rise
in
the
rental
might
be
considered
as
shelved
lord
inverbroom
would
be
in
bracebridge
this
morning
since
he
would
be
presiding
at
the
election
at
the
club
at
twelve
o
clock
and
had
promised
to
communicate
the
result
at
once
very
likely
keeling
would
drop
in
at
the
club
to
have
a
bit
of
lunch
there
and
he
could
get
a
chat
with
lord
inverbroom
then
but
as
he
slid
upwards
in
the
droning
lift
that
took
him
to
the
floor
where
his
office
was
the
club
the
election
and
all
connected
with
it
vanished
from
his
brain
like
the
dispersing
mists
on
a
summer
morning
for
a
few
steps
would
take
him
along
the
corridor
to
the
room
where
norah
was
opening
his
letters
that
moment
of
his
entry
had
become
to
him
a
matter
of
daily
excitement
and
expectation
sometimes
the
soft
furrow
would
be
ruled
between
her
eyebrows
and
she
would
give
him
but
the
glance
of
a
stranger
and
a
chilly
and
instantly
turn
her
attention
to
her
work
again
sometimes
she
would
show
such
a
face
as
she
had
shown
him
that
sunday
morning
on
the
downs
when
they
had
listened
to
the
skylark
together
a
face
of
childhood
and
the
possession
of
spring
sometimes
and
it
was
this
that
gave
the
grizzled
elderly
man
the
tremulous
excitement
of
a
boy
when
his
hand
opened
the
door
she
would
give
him
that
look
which
had
shot
across
the
like
the
launching
of
a
silver
spear
and
transfixed
him
but
if
he
did
not
get
it
then
sometime
during
the
morning
in
some
pause
in
the
work
or
perhaps
even
in
the
middle
of
his
dictation
he
would
receive
it
from
her
just
that
one
look
which
made
him
know
so
long
as
it
lasted
that
there
was
no
bar
or
impediment
between
himself
and
her
there
was
neither
speech
nor
language
but
her
essential
self
spoke
revealing
affirming
to
him
its
existence
then
without
pause
she
would
drop
her
eyes
to
her
work
again
and
her
busy
pencil
scooped
and
dabbed
over
the
paper
and
he
heard
in
some
secret
place
of
his
brain
while
his
lips
pronounced
sharp
sentences
the
words
and
thou
beside
me
singing
in
the
in
the
afternoon
when
he
came
to
read
over
her
typewritten
transcription
of
the
dictation
he
always
knew
at
what
point
in
some
peremptory
letter
out
of
all
the
sheaf
that
moment
of
the
clear
glance
had
come
he
was
always
on
the
for
it
but
he
could
never
induce
it
she
gave
it
him
so
it
had
begun
to
seem
not
in
answer
to
him
but
just
when
she
could
withhold
it
no
longer
this
morning
the
correspondence
was
both
heavy
and
complicated
a
whole
series
of
widely
scattered
dates
had
to
be
turned
up
in
order
to
trace
some
question
of
the
payment
of
carriage
on
a
certain
consignment
it
was
a
tiresome
job
which
norah
recommended
him
to
leave
for
verification
to
the
clerk
downstairs
whose
business
it
was
and
probably
for
that
very
reason
sir
thomas
insisted
on
doing
it
himself
he
was
fractious
he
was
obstinately
determined
to
have
the
matter
settled
here
and
now
and
like
a
child
cross
with
hunger
he
wanted
the
clear
look
she
had
not
yet
given
him
the
furrow
that
soft
smudge
had
long
been
marked
on
norah
s
forehead
as
she
turned
up
letter
after
letter
that
failed
to
deal
with
the
point
and
she
spent
what
she
considered
a
wasted
half
hour
over
it
she
was
still
rather
irritated
when
she
found
what
she
had
been
looking
for
unclipped
the
communication
from
the
spring
that
fastened
it
into
its
place
and
passed
it
him
i
think
that
s
what
you
are
wanting
sir
thomas
she
said
he
took
it
from
her
and
noticing
the
rather
incisive
politeness
of
her
tone
looked
up
at
her
the
furrow
was
still
there
very
impatiently
ruled
but
the
clear
glance
was
there
also
radiantly
it
shone
on
him
quite
undisturbed
by
the
superficial
agitation
it
concerned
not
the
surface
of
her
but
the
depths
he
did
not
look
at
the
paper
she
handed
him
on
which
his
unconscious
fingers
had
closed
he
was
not
going
to
miss
one
infinitesimal
fraction
of
the
moment
that
she
had
at
last
given
him
she
frowned
still
but
that
was
the
property
of
her
tiresome
search
it
was
neither
his
nor
hers
as
he
or
she
you
will
find
it
on
the
third
line
from
the
end
she
said
messrs
hampden
are
perfectly
right
about
and
then
the
moment
was
over
except
that
in
the
secret
place
of
his
brain
the
voice
sang
in
the
wilderness
and
he
looked
at
the
letter
she
had
given
him
the
words
danced
and
swam
presently
they
steadied
themselves
i
see
he
said
well
then
miss
propert
you
must
cross
out
what
i
have
dictated
to
you
about
it
please
read
the
letter
through
yes
cross
out
from
the
sentence
beginning
re
the
payment
for
carriage
of
dear
me
it
is
nearly
one
what
a
lot
of
time
we
have
spent
over
that
the
would
have
done
it
much
more
the
frown
cleared
but
the
clear
look
did
not
return
it
was
over
it
seemed
she
had
satisfied
herself
i
think
we
should
have
saved
time
she
said
yes
you
were
quite
right
you
like
being
right
don
t
you
he
got
a
smile
for
that
the
sort
of
smile
that
anybody
might
have
had
from
her
i
suppose
i
do
she
said
certainly
i
hate
being
but
i
was
wrong
this
time
he
said
i
gave
you
a
lot
of
trouble
in
that
again
was
no
use
he
but
got
another
smile
and
a
friendly
look
of
the
sort
he
no
longer
wanted
is
that
all
then
he
asked
no
sir
thomas
there
are
half
a
dozen
more
letters
he
had
just
taken
the
next
when
there
came
a
tap
at
the
door
and
a
boy
entered
he
was
not
one
of
the
of
the
stores
with
peaked
cap
and
brass
buttons
but
keeling
had
an
impression
of
having
seen
him
before
then
he
recollected
he
often
lounged
at
the
door
of
the
county
club
a
note
from
lord
inverbroom
sir
he
said
his
lordship
told
me
to
give
it
you
wait
and
see
if
there
is
an
answer
said
keeling
he
tore
open
the
envelope
it
was
already
after
one
and
probably
there
would
be
no
answer
since
he
would
see
lord
inverbroom
at
the
club
where
he
proposed
to
have
lunch
the
note
was
quite
short
dear
sir
thomas
i
promised
to
let
you
know
the
result
of
the
election
the
meeting
is
just
over
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
you
have
not
been
elected
please
allow
me
to
express
my
sincere
regrets
yours
truly
keeling
had
one
moment
of
sheer
surprise
he
had
been
perfectly
sure
of
being
elected
then
without
any
conscious
feeling
of
rancour
or
disappointment
his
mind
passed
direct
to
what
he
had
already
determined
to
do
if
this
contingency
which
since
the
opening
of
the
he
had
thought
impossible
actually
occurred
wait
a
moment
he
said
to
the
messenger
there
will
be
an
answer
for
you
to
take
back
to
lord
he
turned
to
norah
please
take
this
down
direct
on
your
typewriter
he
said
with
a
carbon
copy
to
norah
put
the
two
sheets
on
the
roller
dated
the
paper
and
waited
keeling
thought
for
half
a
minute
drumming
with
his
fingers
on
the
table
are
you
ready
he
said
and
dictated
dear
lord
inverbroom
yours
to
hand
re
the
election
at
the
county
club
of
which
i
note
the
contents
i
wish
also
to
acquaint
you
as
president
with
the
fact
that
i
have
lately
bought
the
freehold
of
your
premises
i
see
that
there
is
a
break
in
your
lease
at
midsummer
this
year
on
both
tenants
and
landlord
s
side
and
therefore
beg
to
give
you
this
formal
notice
that
i
do
not
intend
to
renew
the
lease
hitherto
held
by
your
club
as
i
shall
be
using
the
premises
for
some
other
purpose
yours
faithfully
read
it
over
please
miss
propert
he
said
and
i
will
sign
it
file
this
note
of
lord
inverbroom
s
with
your
carbon
copy
and
docket
norah
brought
him
over
the
typed
letter
what
docket
shall
i
put
on
them
she
asked
to
county
club
notice
of
termination
of
club
s
he
signed
the
letter
to
lord
inverbroom
and
sent
the
boy
back
with
it
now
we
will
go
on
with
the
rest
of
the
shorthand
he
said
norah
came
back
to
the
table
took
up
her
pencil
and
then
laid
it
down
again
the
frown
was
heavily
creased
in
her
forehead
may
i
just
say
something
to
you
before
we
begin
she
said
you
may
think
it
a
great
impertinence
but
it
is
not
meant
what
is
it
he
said
i
beg
you
to
call
the
boy
back
and
not
send
that
note
she
said
i
hate
to
think
of
your
doing
that
it
isn
t
the
act
of
she
stopped
suddenly
he
easily
supplied
the
rest
of
her
sentence
it
isn
t
the
act
of
a
gentleman
he
said
but
they
ve
just
told
me
that
i
m
not
one
or
they
would
have
elected
me
they
will
like
to
know
how
right
they
he
paused
a
moment
i
am
sure
you
did
not
mean
an
impertinence
miss
propert
he
added
but
i
think
you
have
committed
i
am
very
sorry
then
said
she
yes
we
will
get
on
with
the
shorthand
keeling
seldom
wasted
thought
or
energy
on
irremediable
mischances
if
a
business
proposition
turned
out
badly
he
cut
his
loss
on
it
and
dismissed
it
from
his
mind
but
it
was
equally
characteristic
of
him
to
strike
and
strike
hard
if
opportunity
offered
at
any
firm
which
had
let
him
in
for
his
loss
and
in
this
case
since
the
club
had
hit
at
him
he
felt
it
was
but
fair
that
he
should
return
the
blow
with
precise
and
instantaneous
vigour
that
was
right
and
proper
and
his
rejoinder
to
norah
that
the
club
who
did
not
consider
him
sufficient
of
a
gentleman
to
enter
their
doors
should
have
the
pleasure
of
knowing
how
right
they
were
had
at
least
as
much
sober
truth
as
irony
about
it
the
opportunity
to
hit
back
was
ready
to
hand
it
would
have
been
singular
indeed
and
in
flat
contradiction
to
his
habits
if
he
had
not
taken
it
but
when
once
he
had
done
that
he
was
satisfied
they
did
not
want
him
as
a
member
and
he
did
not
want
them
as
tenants
and
there
was
the
end
of
it
yet
like
some
fermenting
focus
in
his
brain
minute
as
yet
but
with
the
potentiality
of
leaven
in
it
was
the
fact
that
norah
had
implored
him
not
to
send
his
answer
to
lord
inverbroom
he
still
considered
her
interference
an
impertinence
but
what
stuck
in
his
mind
and
began
faintly
to
suggest
other
trains
of
thought
was
the
equally
undeniable
fact
that
she
had
not
meant
it
as
an
impertinence
in
intention
it
had
been
a
friendly
speech
inspired
by
the
of
a
friend
but
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
at
it
she
did
not
understand
business
or
possibly
he
did
not
understand
clubs
so
be
it
then
he
did
not
want
to
understand
them
it
was
with
a
mixture
of
curiosity
and
annoyance
that
he
saw
lord
inverbroom
walking
towards
him
along
alfred
road
when
he
left
the
stores
that
afternoon
the
curiosity
was
due
to
the
desire
to
see
how
lord
inverbroom
would
behave
whether
he
would
cross
the
street
or
cut
him
dead
the
annoyance
arose
from
the
fact
that
he
could
not
determine
how
to
behave
himself
at
this
awkward
encounter
but
when
he
observed
that
there
was
to
be
no
cutting
or
crossing
the
street
at
all
but
perfect
cordiality
and
an
outstretched
hand
it
faintly
and
pleasantly
occurred
to
him
that
owing
to
his
letter
there
might
be
forthcoming
another
election
at
the
club
with
a
request
that
he
would
submit
himself
to
a
further
suffrage
that
would
certainly
have
pleased
him
for
he
had
sufficient
revengefulness
in
his
character
to
decline
such
a
proposition
with
thanks
no
such
proposition
was
submitted
to
him
i
was
just
going
to
leave
this
note
at
your
office
sir
thomas
said
lord
inverbroom
may
i
give
it
you
instead
and
save
myself
a
further
walk
it
is
just
the
acknowledgment
of
your
letter
about
the
termination
of
our
lease
perhaps
you
will
glance
at
it
to
see
that
it
is
in
keeling
felt
in
spite
of
his
habits
that
this
was
unnecessary
true
this
was
a
matter
of
business
and
he
should
have
verified
the
correctness
of
lord
inverbroom
s
information
but
instead
he
merely
put
it
into
his
pocket
that
is
all
right
he
said
are
you
going
home
asked
the
other
my
wife
i
know
is
calling
on
lady
keeling
and
she
will
pick
me
up
there
if
she
has
not
been
so
fortunate
as
to
find
lady
keeling
in
she
will
wait
for
me
in
the
motor
may
we
not
walk
down
there
together
i
shall
be
delighted
said
keeling
he
still
did
not
know
how
to
behave
but
was
gradually
becoming
aware
that
no
behaviour
was
necessary
behaviour
as
such
did
not
seem
to
exist
for
his
companion
and
he
could
not
help
wondering
what
took
its
place
my
wife
is
furious
with
me
lord
inverbroom
went
on
i
have
succumbed
to
the
leonardo
book
instead
of
having
the
ceiling
whitewashed
she
has
a
materialistic
mind
preferring
whitewash
to
leonardo
besides
as
i
told
her
she
never
looks
at
the
ceiling
and
i
shall
often
look
at
my
book
have
you
come
across
anything
lately
which
life
is
not
worth
living
without
perhaps
you
had
better
not
tell
me
if
you
have
or
i
shall
practise
some
further
domestic
i
shall
be
very
pleased
to
show
you
anything
i
ve
got
said
keeling
we
will
have
a
cup
of
tea
in
my
library
unless
lady
inverbroom
is
waiting
in
your
ah
that
would
be
a
great
treat
let
us
do
that
in
any
case
sir
thomas
surely
we
can
go
in
some
back
way
so
as
to
escape
my
wife
s
notice
if
she
is
really
waiting
outside
it
will
do
her
good
to
wait
she
is
very
keeling
was
completely
puzzled
if
he
had
ventured
to
speak
in
this
sense
of
lady
keeling
he
knew
he
would
have
made
a
sad
mess
of
it
in
his
mouth
the
same
material
would
have
merely
expressed
itself
in
a
rude
light
he
tried
rather
mistakenly
to
copy
the
manner
that
was
no
manner
at
all
ah
i
should
get
a
good
scolding
if
i
treated
lady
keeling
like
that
he
said
it
did
not
sound
right
as
he
said
it
he
had
the
perception
of
that
he
perceived
too
that
lord
inverbroom
did
not
pursue
the
style
then
presently
arriving
they
found
that
the
waiting
motor
contained
no
impatient
lady
inverbroom
and
they
stole
into
the
library
at
her
husband
s
desire
so
that
no
news
of
his
coming
should
reach
her
until
he
had
had
a
quarter
of
an
hour
there
with
his
host
then
perhaps
she
might
be
told
if
sir
thomas
would
have
the
goodness
lord
inverbroom
sauntered
about
in
the
grazing
ambulatory
fashion
of
the
and
when
his
quarter
of
an
hour
was
already
more
than
spent
he
put
the
volume
he
was
examining
back
into
its
place
again
with
a
certain
air
of
decision
i
should
like
to
express
to
you
by
actual
word
of
mouth
sir
thomas
he
said
my
regret
at
what
happened
i
am
all
the
more
sorry
for
it
because
i
notice
that
in
our
rules
the
landlord
of
the
club
is
a
member
of
it
if
you
only
had
told
me
that
you
had
become
our
landlord
i
could
have
informed
you
of
that
and
spared
you
this
there
was
no
mistaking
the
sincerity
of
this
the
good
feeling
of
it
keeling
was
moved
to
be
equally
sincere
i
knew
that
already
he
said
lord
inverbroom
looked
completely
puzzled
then
will
you
pardon
me
for
asking
why
you
did
not
take
advantage
of
it
and
become
a
member
of
the
club
without
any
further
bother
because
i
wished
to
know
that
i
was
acceptable
as
a
member
of
the
club
to
the
other
members
said
keeling
they
have
told
me
that
i
am
there
was
a
good
deal
of
dignity
in
this
reply
it
sprang
from
a
feeling
that
lord
inverbroom
was
perfectly
competent
to
appreciate
i
understand
he
said
and
what
you
have
said
much
increases
my
regret
at
the
election
going
as
it
he
paused
a
moment
evidently
thinking
and
keeling
had
an
opportunity
to
wager
been
offered
him
would
have
bet
that
his
next
words
would
convey
however
delicately
the
hope
that
keeling
would
reconsider
his
letter
of
the
morning
announcing
the
termination
of
the
club
s
lease
he
was
not
prepared
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
and
hoped
indeed
that
the
suggestion
would
not
be
made
but
that
he
should
have
thought
that
the
suggestion
was
going
to
be
made
showed
very
precisely
how
unintelligible
to
him
was
the
whole
nature
of
the
class
which
lord
inverbroom
represented
no
such
suggestion
was
made
any
more
than
half
an
hour
ago
any
idea
of
a
fresh
election
being
held
was
mooted
i
had
the
pleasure
of
speaking
very
warmly
in
your
favour
sir
thomas
said
lord
inverbroom
at
length
and
of
course
of
voting
for
you
i
may
tell
you
that
i
am
now
considering
in
consequence
of
the
election
whether
i
shall
not
resign
the
presidency
of
the
club
it
is
an
unusual
proceeding
to
reject
the
president
s
candidate
i
think
your
rejection
reflects
upon
keeling
was
being
insensibly
affected
by
his
companion
s
simplicity
behaviour
seemed
a
very
easy
matter
to
lord
inverbroom
it
was
a
mere
matter
of
being
simple
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
have
been
the
cause
of
that
he
said
and
i
don
t
think
it
would
be
logical
of
you
you
urged
me
to
withdraw
which
was
the
most
you
could
do
after
you
had
promised
to
propose
lord
inverbroom
s
sense
of
being
puzzled
increased
here
was
a
man
who
had
written
a
letter
this
morning
turning
the
club
out
of
their
premises
merely
because
he
had
been
blackballed
who
yet
showed
both
by
the
fact
of
his
seeking
election
in
the
ordinary
way
instead
of
claiming
it
and
by
this
delicate
appreciation
of
his
own
position
all
those
instincts
which
his
letter
of
this
morning
so
flatly
contradicted
yes
i
urged
you
not
to
stand
he
said
and
that
is
the
only
reason
why
i
hesitate
about
resigning
i
should
like
you
to
know
that
if
i
remain
in
my
post
that
is
the
cause
of
my
doing
so
otherwise
i
should
the
other
side
of
the
question
presented
itself
to
keeling
it
would
be
a
rare
stroke
to
deprive
the
club
not
only
of
its
premises
but
of
its
president
though
he
had
just
said
that
he
hoped
lord
inverbroom
would
not
resign
he
felt
it
would
be
an
extreme
personal
pleasure
if
he
did
and
then
a
further
scheme
came
into
his
head
another
nail
in
the
coffin
of
the
county
club
and
with
that
all
his
inherent
caddishness
rose
paramount
over
such
indications
of
feelings
as
lord
inverbroom
understood
and
appreciated
perhaps
if
you
left
the
county
club
he
said
you
would
do
us
the
honour
to
join
the
town
club
i
am
the
president
of
that
i
would
think
it
however
an
honour
to
resign
my
post
if
you
would
consent
to
take
it
i
ll
warrant
you
there
ll
be
no
mischance
over
that
lord
inverbroom
suddenly
stiffened
you
are
very
good
to
suggest
that
he
said
but
it
would
be
utterly
out
of
the
question
well
sir
thomas
i
envy
you
your
library
and
here
i
see
is
your
new
catalogue
miss
propert
told
me
she
was
working
at
it
may
i
look
at
it
yes
indeed
that
is
admirably
done
author
and
title
of
the
book
and
illustrator
as
well
all
entered
her
father
was
a
great
friend
of
mine
she
may
have
told
you
that
very
tragic
she
has
never
mentioned
her
father
to
me
was
he
well
the
sort
of
man
whom
the
county
club
would
not
have
blackballed
perhaps
that
was
the
worst
thing
he
had
said
yet
though
indeed
he
meant
but
a
grimly
humourous
observation
not
perceiving
nor
being
able
to
perceive
in
how
odious
a
position
he
put
his
guest
but
lord
inverbroom
s
impenetrable
armour
of
effortless
good
breeding
could
turn
even
that
aside
he
laughed
well
after
what
the
club
has
done
he
said
there
is
no
telling
whom
they
would
blackball
but
certainly
i
should
have
been
at
one
time
very
happy
to
propose
keeling
s
preoccupation
with
the
club
suddenly
ceased
he
wanted
so
much
more
to
know
anything
that
concerned
norah
perhaps
you
would
tell
me
something
about
him
he
said
ah
that
would
not
be
quite
right
would
it
said
lord
inverbroom
still
unperturbed
if
miss
propert
has
not
cared
to
speak
to
you
of
keeling
found
himself
alternately
envying
and
detesting
this
impenetrable
armour
there
was
no
joint
in
it
it
was
abominably
complete
and
even
while
he
hated
it
he
appreciated
and
coveted
it
i
understand
he
said
no
telling
tales
out
of
quite
so
and
now
will
you
take
me
to
find
my
wife
let
us
be
in
a
conspiracy
and
not
mention
that
we
have
been
in
the
house
half
an
hour
already
i
should
dearly
like
another
but
all
the
time
lady
keeling
is
bearing
the
infliction
of
a
prodigiously
long
lady
keeling
will
be
only
too
gratified
said
her
husband
that
is
very
kind
of
her
but
indeed
i
think
we
had
better
gratification
was
certainly
not
too
strong
a
term
to
employ
with
regard
to
lady
keeling
s
feelings
nor
indeed
too
strong
to
apply
to
lady
inverbroom
s
when
her
call
was
brought
to
an
end
the
sublimity
of
princesses
was
not
to
be
had
every
day
and
the
fortnight
that
had
elapsed
since
that
memorable
visit
with
the
return
of
the
routine
of
undistinguished
bracebridge
had
caused
so
prolonged
a
visit
from
a
peeress
to
mount
into
lady
keeling
s
head
like
an
hour
s
steady
drinking
of
strong
wine
well
i
ve
never
enjoyed
an
hour
s
chat
more
she
said
as
keeling
returned
after
seeing
their
guests
off
and
it
seemed
no
more
than
five
minutes
she
was
all
affability
wasn
t
she
alice
and
so
full
of
admiration
for
all
my
what
did
she
call
them
some
french
bibelots
suggested
alice
biblos
that
was
it
and
she
never
seemed
to
think
how
time
was
flying
for
she
never
once
alluded
to
her
husband
s
being
so
late
to
be
sure
she
might
have
she
might
perhaps
have
said
she
was
afraid
she
was
keeping
me
from
my
occupations
for
i
could
have
assured
her
very
handsomely
that
i
was
more
than
pleased
to
sit
and
talk
to
her
and
it
is
all
quite
true
thomas
about
the
princess
s
visit
next
month
you
may
be
sure
i
asked
about
that
she
is
coming
down
to
spend
three
days
with
them
very
quietly
lady
inverbroom
said
yes
she
said
that
twice
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
though
i
caught
it
perfectly
the
first
time
but
i
shall
be
very
much
surprised
if
i
don
t
get
a
note
asking
us
to
dine
and
sleep
with
alice
as
well
perhaps
for
i
said
what
a
pleasure
it
would
be
to
alice
to
see
her
beautiful
house
and
grounds
some
day
but
i
shall
quite
understand
after
what
she
said
about
the
visit
being
very
quiet
why
there
will
be
no
party
after
all
it
was
a
very
pleasant
evening
we
spent
there
before
when
there
were
no
guests
at
all
i
said
how
much
we
enjoyed
quiet
visits
with
no
did
you
ask
for
any
more
invitations
said
keeling
as
his
wife
paused
for
breath
my
dear
thomas
you
quite
misunderstand
me
i
asked
for
nothing
except
that
i
might
take
mamma
some
day
for
a
drive
through
their
park
i
hope
i
know
how
to
behave
better
than
that
another
thing
too
miss
propert
has
been
there
twice
once
to
tea
and
once
to
lunch
i
hope
she
will
not
have
her
head
turned
for
it
seems
that
she
did
not
take
her
meals
in
the
housekeeper
s
room
but
upstairs
but
that
is
none
of
my
business
i
am
sure
lady
inverbroom
may
give
her
lunch
on
the
top
of
the
if
she
wishes
and
i
said
very
distinctly
that
i
had
always
found
her
a
very
young
woman
and
mentioned
nothing
about
her
bouncing
in
in
the
middle
of
my
nor
when
she
spent
sunday
morning
in
your
library
bygones
are
bygones
that
s
what
i
always
say
and
act
on
this
certainly
appeared
to
have
been
the
case
lady
keeling
s
miscroscopic
mind
seemed
to
have
diverted
its
minute
gaze
altogether
from
norah
to
keeling
that
was
a
miscroscopic
relief
but
no
more
for
it
seemed
to
him
to
matter
very
little
what
his
wife
thought
about
norah
lord
inverbroom
was
a
great
friend
of
miss
propert
s
father
at
one
time
he
said
he
told
me
so
only
oh
indeed
very
likely
in
the
sense
that
a
man
may
call
his
butler
an
old
friend
of
the
family
i
should
be
quite
pleased
to
speak
of
parkinson
like
that
i
am
all
for
equality
we
are
all
equal
in
the
sight
of
heaven
as
mr
silverdale
says
dear
me
i
wish
i
was
his
equal
in
energy
next
month
he
holds
a
mission
down
at
easton
haven
among
all
those
ruffians
at
the
docks
in
addition
to
all
his
parish
he
is
doing
far
too
much
said
alice
excitedly
but
he
won
t
listen
he
is
so
naughty
he
promises
me
he
will
be
good
and
not
wear
himself
out
but
he
goes
on
just
the
same
as
ever
except
that
he
gets
worse
and
keeling
listened
to
this
with
a
mixture
of
pity
and
grim
amusement
he
felt
sure
that
his
poor
alice
was
in
love
with
the
man
and
was
sorry
for
alice
in
that
regard
but
what
grimly
amused
him
was
the
utter
impotence
of
alice
to
keep
her
condition
to
herself
he
was
puzzled
also
for
all
this
spring
alice
seemed
to
have
remained
as
much
in
love
with
him
as
ever
but
not
to
have
got
either
worse
or
better
silverdale
filled
her
with
some
frantic
and
wholly
maidenly
excitement
it
was
like
the
love
of
some
antique
spinster
for
her
intense
and
deplorable
and
sexless
he
could
even
joke
in
a
discreet
manner
with
poor
alice
about
it
and
gratify
her
by
so
doing
well
all
you
ladies
who
are
so
much
in
love
with
him
ought
to
be
able
to
manage
him
he
said
alice
bent
over
her
work
she
had
eventually
induced
mr
silverdale
to
sanction
the
creation
of
a
pair
of
slippers
with
a
pleased
smile
father
you
don
t
know
him
she
said
he
s
quite
quite
unmanageable
you
never
saw
any
one
so
punish
him
by
not
giving
him
his
slippers
give
them
me
instead
and
i
ll
wear
them
when
he
comes
to
alice
looked
almost
shocked
at
the
notion
of
such
unhallowed
feet
being
thrust
into
these
hardly
less
than
sacred
embroideries
it
was
as
if
her
mother
had
suggested
making
a
skirt
out
of
the
parrots
and
pomegranates
that
adorned
the
smart
but
she
divined
that
in
spite
of
her
father
s
inexplicable
want
of
reverence
for
the
master
they
had
become
master
and
helper
and
sometimes
she
called
him
sir
much
as
norah
had
called
her
father
but
for
antipodal
reasons
there
lurked
behind
his
rather
unseemly
jokes
a
kindly
intention
towards
herself
he
might
laugh
at
her
but
somehow
below
that
she
felt
and
she
knew
not
how
that
a
part
of
him
understood
and
did
not
laugh
it
was
as
if
he
knew
what
it
meant
to
be
in
love
to
thirst
and
to
be
unslaked
to
be
hungry
and
not
to
be
fed
she
gave
him
a
quick
glance
out
of
her
eyes
a
glance
that
deprecated
and
yet
eagerly
sought
for
the
sympathy
which
she
knew
was
somewhere
about
and
then
lady
keeling
put
in
more
of
her
wrecking
and
shattering
remarks
which
so
unerringly
spoiled
all
the
hints
and
lurking
colours
in
human
intercourse
well
that
would
be
a
funny
notion
for
sir
thomas
keeling
to
wear
slippers
at
dinner
she
said
what
a
to
old
days
i
might
as
well
wear
some
merino
gown
but
what
your
father
says
is
quite
true
alice
we
might
really
take
mr
silverdale
in
hand
and
tell
him
that
s
the
last
he
ll
see
of
us
all
unless
he
takes
more
care
of
himself
i
saw
him
coming
out
of
the
county
club
looking
so
tired
that
i
almost
stopped
my
carriage
and
told
him
to
go
home
to
bed
and
talking
of
the
county
club
thomas
doesn
t
your
election
come
on
soon
you
must
be
sure
to
take
me
to
have
lunch
in
the
ladies
room
one
of
these
days
lady
inverbroom
told
me
she
was
lunching
there
and
had
quite
a
clean
good
sort
of
meal
nothing
very
choice
i
expect
but
i
dare
say
she
doesn
t
care
much
what
she
eats
i
shall
never
forget
what
a
tough
pheasant
we
had
when
we
dined
there
if
i
d
been
told
i
was
eating
a
bit
of
leather
i
should
have
believed
it
perhaps
some
day
when
lord
and
lady
inverbroom
are
in
bracebridge
again
we
might
all
have
lunch
together
for
the
last
six
months
keeling
had
been
obliged
to
keep
a
hand
on
himself
when
he
was
with
his
wife
for
either
she
had
developed
an
amazing
talent
for
putting
him
on
edge
or
he
a
susceptibility
for
being
irritated
by
her
both
causes
probably
contributed
for
since
her
accession
to
greatness
her
condescension
had
vastly
increased
while
he
on
his
side
had
certainly
grown
more
sensitive
to
her
pretentiousness
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
he
restrained
himself
from
snapping
at
her
no
i
m
afraid
that
can
t
be
emmeline
he
said
the
election
came
off
and
the
club
has
settled
it
can
do
without
well
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
they
haven
t
elected
you
do
you
mean
the
mayor
of
bracebridge
and
to
say
nothing
of
your
being
a
baronet
who
are
those
people
i
should
like
to
know
my
dear
thomas
i
have
an
idea
i
should
not
wonder
if
lord
inverbroom
was
in
it
he
has
been
quite
cock
of
the
walk
as
you
may
say
up
till
now
and
he
doesn
t
want
any
rival
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
hope
you
ll
serve
them
out
well
for
it
i
have
done
so
already
i
bought
the
freehold
of
the
club
not
so
long
ago
and
i
have
given
them
notice
that
i
shall
not
renew
their
lease
in
the
lady
keeling
clapped
her
soft
fat
hands
together
that
s
the
right
sort
of
way
to
treat
them
she
said
in
great
glee
that
will
pay
them
out
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
as
not
electing
a
baronet
who
do
they
think
they
are
what
fun
it
will
be
to
see
all
their
great
sofas
being
bundled
into
the
street
and
they
bought
all
their
furniture
at
your
stores
did
they
not
that
is
the
cream
of
it
to
my
mind
i
should
not
wonder
if
they
want
to
sell
it
all
back
to
you
that
would
be
a
fine
for
the
first
time
now
that
his
wife
so
lavishly
applauded
his
action
keeling
began
to
be
not
so
satisfied
with
it
the
fact
that
it
commended
itself
to
her
type
of
mind
was
an
argument
against
it
her
praise
disgusted
him
it
was
at
least
as
impertinent
as
norah
s
disapprobation
alice
fixed
her
faint
eyes
on
her
father
oh
i
wish
you
hadn
t
done
that
she
said
does
lord
inverbroom
know
that
mark
my
words
said
his
wife
lord
inverbroom
s
at
the
bottom
of
it
nothing
of
the
kind
emmeline
he
said
sharply
lord
inverbroom
proposed
then
he
turned
to
alice
yes
he
knows
he
said
i
gave
notice
to
him
and
why
do
you
wish
i
hadn
t
done
it
i
declare
i
m
getting
like
mr
silverdale
all
the
ladies
are
concerning
themselves
with
me
there
s
your
mother
saying
i
ve
done
right
and
you
and
miss
propert
saying
i
ve
done
wrong
there
s
no
pleasing
you
and
what
has
miss
propert
got
to
do
with
it
asked
lady
keeling
that
she
disapproves
of
what
you
ve
done
she
ll
be
wanting
to
run
your
stores
for
you
next
and
just
because
she
s
been
to
lunch
with
lord
inverbroom
i
never
heard
of
such
impertinence
as
miss
propert
giving
her
opinion
you
ll
have
trouble
with
your
miss
propert
you
ought
to
give
her
one
of
your
good
snubs
or
dismiss
her
altogether
that
would
be
far
the
keeling
felt
as
some
practitioner
of
might
do
when
he
had
opened
at
some
strangely
apposite
text
to
consult
his
wife
about
anything
was
like
opening
a
book
at
random
a
wholly
irrational
proceeding
but
he
could
not
but
be
impressed
by
the
sudden
applicability
of
this
his
wife
did
not
know
the
situation
any
more
than
did
the
musty
volume
but
he
wondered
if
she
had
not
answered
with
a
strange
wisdom
wholly
foreign
to
her
now
you
have
given
your
opinion
emmeline
he
said
and
you
must
allow
somebody
else
to
talk
i
want
to
know
why
alice
alice
stitched
violently
at
the
slipper
mr
silverdale
will
be
so
sorry
she
said
he
drops
in
there
sometimes
for
a
rubber
of
bridge
for
he
thinks
that
it
is
such
a
good
thing
to
show
that
a
clergyman
can
be
a
man
of
the
world
keeling
rose
this
was
altogether
too
much
for
him
well
we
ve
wasted
enough
time
talking
about
it
all
he
said
if
that
s
all
the
reason
i
m
to
but
it
isn
t
said
alice
i
can
t
express
it
but
i
can
feel
it
i
know
i
should
agree
with
miss
propert
and
lord
inverbroom
about
it
what
did
miss
propert
say
well
talking
of
waste
of
time
observed
lady
keeling
indignantly
i
can
t
think
of
any
worse
waste
than
caring
to
know
what
miss
propert
keeling
turned
to
her
perhaps
you
can
t
he
said
and
you
d
better
have
your
nap
that
won
t
be
waste
of
time
you
re
tired
with
talking
and
i
m
sure
i
am
he
left
the
room
without
more
words
and
lady
keeling
settled
another
cushion
against
what
must
be
called
the
small
of
her
back
your
father
s
served
them
out
well
she
said
that
s
the
way
to
get
on
to
think
of
their
not
considering
him
good
enough
for
their
club
he
has
shown
his
spirit
very
properly
but
the
idea
of
miss
propert
telling
him
what
s
right
and
what
isn
t
on
shillings
a
i
can
t
bear
to
think
of
mr
silverdale
not
having
his
rubber
of
bridge
now
and
then
said
alice
it
was
such
a
refreshment
to
keeling
had
intended
to
pass
an
hour
among
his
books
to
wash
off
the
scum
so
to
speak
of
this
atrocious
conversation
but
when
he
got
to
his
library
and
had
taken
down
his
new
edition
of
omar
khayyam
which
charles
propert
had
induced
him
to
buy
he
found
it
could
give
him
very
little
emotion
he
was
aware
of
the
exquisite
type
of
the
strange
sensuous
that
somehow
affected
him
like
a
subtle
odour
of
the
beautiful
binding
and
not
least
of
the
text
itself
but
all
these
perfections
were
no
more
than
presented
to
him
they
did
not
penetrate
he
could
not
rid
himself
of
the
scum
the
odiousness
of
his
wife
s
approbation
would
not
be
washed
off
and
what
made
it
cling
was
the
fact
that
she
had
divined
him
correctly
had
rejoiced
at
his
serving
the
club
it
was
just
that
which
norah
deprecated
and
he
felt
that
lord
inverbroom
s
complete
silence
on
the
point
his
forbearance
to
hint
ever
so
faintly
that
perhaps
keeling
would
reconsider
his
action
expressed
disapprobation
as
eloquently
as
norah
s
phrase
which
he
had
finished
for
her
had
done
it
was
a
caddish
act
that
was
what
they
both
thought
about
it
and
alice
when
she
had
finished
her
nonsense
about
mr
silverdale
s
rubber
of
bridge
had
a
similar
protest
in
her
mind
he
did
not
rate
poor
alice
s
mind
at
any
high
figure
it
was
but
the
fact
that
she
was
allied
to
the
other
two
and
opposed
to
her
mother
that
added
a
little
weight
to
her
opinion
he
wanted
to
be
considered
a
gentleman
and
when
others
declined
to
receive
him
as
such
he
had
but
justified
their
verdict
by
behaving
like
a
cad
he
was
a
cad
here
was
the
truth
of
it
as
it
struck
him
now
and
that
was
why
he
had
behaved
like
one
he
shut
his
meaningless
book
now
intensely
disliking
the
step
he
had
taken
which
at
the
time
had
seemed
so
smart
a
rejoinder
probably
if
at
this
moment
lord
inverbroom
had
appeared
asking
him
to
cancel
it
he
would
have
done
so
but
that
was
exactly
what
it
was
certain
lord
inverbroom
would
not
do
there
remained
norah
he
wondered
whether
norah
would
refer
to
it
again
probably
not
he
had
made
clear
that
he
thought
the
offering
of
her
opinion
was
a
great
impertinence
and
now
to
his
annoyance
he
remembered
that
his
wife
had
also
considered
it
as
such
again
she
agreed
with
him
and
again
the
fact
of
her
concurrence
made
him
lose
confidence
in
the
justice
of
his
own
view
he
had
instantly
acquitted
norah
of
deliberate
impertinence
now
he
reconsidered
whether
it
had
been
an
impertinence
at
all
what
if
it
was
the
simple
desire
of
a
friend
to
save
a
friend
from
a
blunder
an
unworthiness
he
had
grown
to
detest
the
time
after
dinner
passed
in
the
plushy
painted
hitherto
in
all
these
years
of
increasing
prosperity
during
which
the
conscious
effort
of
his
brain
had
been
directed
to
business
and
he
had
not
objected
after
the
work
of
the
day
to
pass
a
quiescent
hour
or
two
before
his
early
bedtime
giving
half
an
ear
to
his
wife
s
babble
which
with
her
brain
thickened
with
refreshment
always
reached
its
of
voluble
incoherence
now
giving
half
an
eye
to
alice
with
her
industrious
needle
all
the
time
a
vague
simmer
of
mercantile
meditation
gently
occupied
him
his
mind
like
some
kitchen
fire
with
the
damper
pushed
in
kept
itself
just
alight
smouldered
and
burned
low
and
alice
s
needle
was
but
like
the
bars
of
the
grate
and
his
wife
s
prattle
the
mild
rumble
of
water
in
the
boiler
it
was
all
domestic
and
normal
in
accordance
with
the
general
destiny
of
prosperous
men
in
middle
age
indeed
he
was
luckier
in
some
respects
than
the
average
for
there
had
always
been
for
him
his
secret
garden
the
into
which
neither
his
family
nor
his
business
interests
ever
entered
now
even
that
had
been
invaded
norah
s
catalogue
had
become
to
him
the
most
precious
of
his
books
she
was
like
sunshine
in
his
secret
garden
or
like
a
bitter
wind
something
anyhow
that
got
between
him
and
his
garden
beds
while
here
in
the
in
the
domestic
hour
after
dinner
the
fact
of
her
made
itself
even
more
insistently
felt
for
she
turned
lady
keeling
s
vapidities
to
which
hitherto
he
had
been
impervious
into
an
active
stinging
irritation
and
even
poor
alice
s
industrious
needle
and
the
pattern
of
maltese
crosses
on
mr
silverdale
s
slippers
was
like
some
monotonous
recurring
drip
of
water
that
set
his
nerves
on
edge
this
was
a
pretty
state
of
mind
he
told
himself
for
a
hardheaded
business
man
of
fifty
and
yet
even
as
with
all
the
force
of
resolution
that
was
in
him
he
tried
to
find
something
in
his
wife
s
remarks
that
could
awake
a
relevant
reasonable
reply
some
rebellious
consciousness
in
his
brain
would
only
concern
itself
with
counting
on
the
pink
clock
the
hours
that
lay
between
the
present
moment
and
nine
o
clock
next
morning
and
then
the
pink
clock
melodiously
announced
on
the
westminster
chime
that
it
was
half
past
ten
and
alice
put
her
needle
into
the
middle
of
the
last
maltese
cross
and
lady
keeling
waddled
across
the
room
and
tapped
the
barometer
which
a
marble
diana
held
in
her
chaste
hand
to
see
if
the
weather
promised
well
for
the
bazaar
the
evening
was
over
and
there
would
not
be
another
for
the
next
hours
he
was
always
punctual
at
his
office
lately
he
had
been
before
his
time
there
and
had
begun
to
open
letters
before
norah
arrived
this
happened
next
morning
and
among
others
that
he
had
laid
on
his
desk
was
lord
inverbroom
s
acknowledgment
of
his
notice
to
terminate
the
county
club
s
lease
norah
when
she
came
finished
this
business
for
him
and
in
due
course
handed
him
the
completed
pile
then
as
usual
she
took
her
place
opposite
him
for
the
dictation
of
answers
she
wore
at
her
breast
a
couple
of
daffodils
and
he
noticed
that
as
she
breathed
the
faint
yellow
reflection
they
cast
on
her
chin
stirred
upwards
and
downwards
no
word
had
passed
between
them
since
she
had
expressed
regret
for
what
he
considered
her
impertinence
the
day
before
and
this
morning
she
did
not
once
meet
his
eye
probably
she
considered
herself
in
disgrace
and
it
maddened
him
to
see
her
quiet
acceptance
of
it
which
struck
him
as
contemptuous
she
was
like
some
noble
slave
working
because
she
must
work
for
a
master
she
despised
well
if
that
was
her
attitude
so
be
it
she
might
despise
but
he
was
master
at
his
request
she
read
out
a
letter
she
had
just
taken
down
in
the
middle
he
stopped
her
no
you
have
got
that
wrong
he
said
what
i
said
was
this
and
he
repeated
it
please
attend
more
she
made
no
reply
and
two
minutes
afterwards
he
again
found
her
at
fault
and
the
brutality
the
desire
to
make
the
beloved
suffer
which
in
very
ugly
fashion
often
lies
in
wait
close
to
the
open
high
road
of
love
became
more
active
you
are
wasting
your
time
and
mine
miss
propert
he
said
if
you
do
not
again
he
waited
for
some
reply
some
expression
of
regret
which
she
undoubtedly
owed
him
but
none
came
then
looking
up
while
her
pencil
was
busy
he
saw
that
she
did
not
reply
because
she
could
not
the
reflection
of
the
daffodils
trembled
violently
on
her
chin
and
her
lower
teeth
were
fast
clenched
on
her
upper
lip
to
stifle
the
surrender
of
her
mouth
and
when
he
saw
that
all
his
brutality
all
the
impulse
that
bade
him
hurt
the
thing
he
loved
drained
out
of
him
and
left
him
hateful
to
himself
he
paused
leaving
unfinished
the
sentence
he
was
dictating
and
sat
there
silent
not
daring
to
look
at
her
he
still
felt
she
despised
him
and
now
with
additional
reason
he
resented
the
fact
that
any
one
should
do
that
his
pride
choked
him
and
yet
he
was
ashamed
but
oh
the
contrast
between
this
very
uncomfortable
moment
and
the
comfortable
evenings
with
emmeline
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
apologise
and
presently
he
resumed
his
dictation
norah
it
appeared
had
recovered
control
of
herself
and
when
that
letter
was
finished
she
read
it
over
to
him
quite
steadily
the
next
she
handed
him
was
lord
inverbroom
s
acknowledgment
which
he
had
himself
placed
among
the
rest
of
the
morning
s
correspondence
is
that
just
to
be
filed
she
said
or
is
there
any
answer
he
took
it
up
yes
there
s
an
answer
he
said
and
dictated
dear
lord
inverbroom
re
lease
of
premises
of
county
club
if
you
will
allow
me
i
should
like
to
cancel
the
notice
of
termination
of
said
lease
which
i
sent
you
yesterday
if
this
would
be
any
convenience
to
the
club
i
should
like
also
to
express
to
you
personally
my
regret
for
my
he
paused
i
think
that
s
all
i
need
say
miss
propert
isn
t
it
he
asked
and
then
there
came
for
him
the
direct
glance
a
little
dim
yet
with
the
clear
shining
after
rain
beaming
through
it
oh
i
am
so
glad
she
said
and
if
it
s
not
impertinent
may
i
suggest
something
never
had
the
clear
glance
lasted
so
long
he
expanded
and
throve
in
it
well
go
on
but
take
care
he
said
it
s
only
that
you
should
write
it
yourself
she
said
it
would
be
more
more
and
that
will
satisfy
you
quite
you
will
have
done
yourself
he
pushed
back
his
chair
i
don
t
see
why
you
should
care
he
said
i
ve
treated
you
like
a
brute
all
i
know
you
have
i
cared
about
that
would
you
like
me
to
apologise
he
asked
she
shook
her
head
and
pointed
at
the
letter
not
again
she
said
you
ve
sent
me
a
lovely
apology
already
addressed
to
lord
have
i
indeed
you
must
have
everything
your
own
way
and
how
are
the
bluebells
getting
on
quite
well
they
ll
all
be
out
in
a
fortnight
i
think
i
went
to
look
again
yesterday
the
buds
fat
little
buttons
do
you
remember
have
got
tall
stalks
now
and
the
lark
is
still
may
we
go
there
then
on
saturday
week
he
asked
she
looked
down
a
moment
yes
she
said
softly
raising
her
eyes
again
and
now
shall
we
get
on
with
the
letters
sir
thomas
there
are
still
a
good
many
not
i
would
sooner
talk
to
you
he
said
you
shall
dictate
that
will
be
talking
and
i
will
try
to
listen
very
now
don
t
be
mean
miss
propert
said
he
for
the
second
time
that
morning
she
let
the
clear
glance
shine
on
him
it
brightened
like
dawn
filling
the
space
between
them
and
it
smote
on
his
heart
stupefyingly
sweet
chapter
x
keeling
had
ten
days
to
wait
for
the
saturday
when
he
and
norah
were
to
visit
the
bluebells
together
he
knew
with
that
certainty
of
the
heart
which
utterly
transcends
the
soundest
conclusions
of
reason
and
logic
that
she
loved
him
it
seemed
too
that
it
was
tacitly
agreed
between
them
that
some
confession
some
mutual
revelation
would
then
take
place
that
was
to
be
the
hour
of
their
own
away
from
the
office
and
the
typewriting
and
all
those
things
which
though
they
brought
them
together
essentially
sundered
them
what
should
be
said
then
what
solution
could
possibly
come
out
of
it
all
he
could
form
no
notion
he
ceased
even
to
puzzle
over
it
perhaps
there
was
no
solution
perhaps
this
relationship
was
just
static
outwardly
the
days
passed
precisely
as
usual
they
had
made
their
appointment
and
no
further
allusion
or
reminder
was
necessary
each
evening
brought
nearer
the
hour
of
azure
in
that
hollow
among
the
empty
downs
and
he
desired
neither
to
shorten
nor
to
lengthen
out
the
days
that
separated
him
from
it
but
to
him
everything
except
that
moment
regular
but
rarely
recurring
when
her
eye
sought
his
with
need
and
love
in
it
seemed
and
unsubstantial
nothing
had
power
either
to
vex
or
please
him
he
was
as
always
busy
all
day
and
transacted
his
own
or
municipal
business
with
all
his
usual
thoroughness
and
acute
judgment
but
it
all
went
on
outside
him
the
cupolas
which
his
industry
had
reared
in
the
were
as
unreal
as
the
new
system
of
drainage
in
the
lower
part
of
the
town
which
he
had
exerted
all
his
influence
to
get
carried
through
the
obdurate
conservatism
that
pointed
to
the
rate
of
bracebridge
under
the
old
conditions
he
got
his
way
all
his
life
he
had
been
accustomed
to
dominate
and
command
and
organise
then
when
his
day
s
work
was
done
and
he
returned
home
for
dinner
and
the
ensuing
hours
which
lately
had
been
so
intolerable
he
found
they
irritated
him
no
longer
and
the
fatuous
drip
of
his
wife
s
conversation
was
no
more
to
him
than
some
gutter
that
discharged
not
into
his
house
but
into
the
street
outside
simply
he
cared
nothing
for
it
nor
when
his
failure
to
get
elected
to
the
county
club
occurred
to
him
did
he
care
it
appeared
to
have
happened
but
it
must
have
happened
to
some
stranger
sometimes
before
the
pink
clock
announced
that
it
was
ten
he
would
leave
the
and
go
to
his
library
to
see
whether
in
his
books
there
was
to
be
found
anything
that
stimulated
his
reactions
towards
life
but
they
had
no
message
they
were
dumb
or
he
was
deaf
even
the
catalogue
showed
no
sign
of
life
it
was
norah
s
work
of
course
but
it
was
not
norah
the
day
before
their
tryst
out
among
the
downs
this
stupefied
stagnation
of
emotion
suddenly
left
him
all
morning
and
through
half
the
afternoon
a
succession
of
spring
showers
had
flung
themselves
in
mad
torrents
against
the
windows
of
his
office
and
more
than
once
he
had
seen
norah
look
up
and
knew
as
well
as
if
she
had
spoken
that
she
was
speculating
on
the
likelihood
of
another
drenching
afternoon
but
she
said
nothing
and
again
he
knew
that
neither
storm
nor
tempest
would
keep
her
back
from
their
appointment
any
more
than
it
would
keep
him
the
thing
had
to
be
it
was
arranged
so
and
though
they
should
find
all
the
bluebells
blackened
and
battered
and
the
thunder
bellowed
round
them
that
meeting
in
the
bluebell
wood
was
as
certain
as
the
rising
of
the
sun
and
then
the
clock
on
his
chimed
five
and
with
a
rush
of
reawakened
perception
a
change
as
swift
and
illuminating
as
the
return
of
consciousness
after
an
anaesthetic
he
realised
that
by
this
time
their
meeting
would
be
over
and
they
would
know
each
of
them
what
they
were
to
become
to
each
other
the
week
s
incurious
torpor
broken
once
and
sometimes
twice
a
day
by
her
glance
rolled
away
from
him
the
world
and
all
that
it
contained
started
into
vividness
again
simultaneously
with
the
chiming
clock
she
got
up
and
brought
him
the
finished
typewritten
letters
for
his
signature
there
were
but
a
dozen
of
them
and
the
work
of
reading
and
signing
and
bestowal
in
their
envelopes
was
soon
finished
but
an
intolerable
sense
of
restraint
and
discomfort
surrounded
these
proceedings
he
did
not
look
at
her
nor
she
at
him
and
though
both
were
hugely
conscious
of
each
other
it
was
as
if
they
were
strangers
or
enemies
even
under
some
truce
that
feeling
increased
and
intensified
once
in
handing
a
letter
to
him
a
finger
of
hers
touched
his
and
both
drew
their
hands
quickly
away
she
hurried
over
her
reading
he
scrawled
his
name
they
wanted
to
get
away
from
each
other
as
soon
as
was
possible
then
the
thought
that
they
would
have
to
sit
here
again
together
all
morning
occurred
to
him
and
that
to
him
at
least
was
unfaceable
in
this
reawakened
vividness
to
the
crisis
that
now
impended
in
less
than
the
space
of
a
day
and
a
night
he
felt
he
could
not
meet
her
again
over
common
tasks
it
had
happened
before
occasionally
that
he
had
given
her
a
holiday
on
saturday
morning
from
the
s
work
and
he
seized
at
this
as
she
handed
him
the
last
of
the
batch
to
be
signed
i
don
t
think
you
need
come
down
morning
miss
propert
he
said
you
can
take
the
he
did
not
look
up
but
heard
her
give
a
little
sigh
of
relief
and
knew
that
once
again
he
had
found
the
pulse
in
her
that
beat
with
his
own
yes
she
said
and
dropped
the
letters
into
his
she
had
been
working
that
day
at
the
table
in
his
big
room
and
stood
there
tidying
it
then
she
went
back
into
the
small
room
adjoining
and
he
heard
her
rustle
into
her
mackintosh
then
returning
she
stood
at
the
door
of
it
a
moment
and
from
underneath
his
half
raised
eyes
he
saw
that
she
looked
slowly
all
round
his
room
as
if
perhaps
searching
for
something
or
as
if
rather
committing
it
to
her
memory
then
without
another
word
to
him
she
went
out
and
he
heard
her
steps
tapping
along
the
corridor
to
the
lift
once
they
paused
and
he
that
she
was
coming
back
they
began
again
and
stopped
and
immediately
afterwards
he
heard
the
clang
of
the
grille
and
the
faint
rumble
of
the
descending
lift
he
had
one
overpowering
impulse
that
brought
him
to
his
feet
to
dash
downstairs
and
see
her
go
out
or
if
she
was
gone
already
to
follow
her
into
the
street
just
for
the
sake
of
setting
eyes
on
her
once
more
but
it
took
him
no
further
than
that
and
presently
he
sat
down
again
that
intense
vividness
of
perception
that
had
been
lit
within
him
when
half
an
hour
ago
the
clock
on
his
chimed
still
blazed
he
noticed
a
hundred
minute
details
in
the
room
his
ear
separated
the
hum
of
the
street
below
into
its
component
ingredients
there
was
a
boy
whistling
there
was
a
motor
standing
with
its
engines
still
working
there
was
a
concerning
daffodils
another
concerning
evening
papers
memory
was
similarly
awake
he
remembered
that
his
wife
was
giving
a
little
this
evening
that
silverdale
who
was
setting
out
on
his
mission
to
the
docks
next
day
was
to
be
among
the
guests
and
that
alice
expected
that
the
slippers
of
maltese
crosses
would
be
back
from
being
made
up
in
time
for
him
to
take
them
with
him
he
recalled
out
of
the
well
of
years
how
in
the
early
days
of
his
married
life
emmeline
had
made
him
a
pair
of
slippers
which
did
not
fit
and
in
the
same
breath
remembered
the
exact
look
of
her
face
this
very
morning
when
a
message
had
come
from
her
cook
saying
that
she
could
not
get
a
bit
of
salmon
anywhere
and
as
each
impression
registered
itself
on
eye
and
ear
and
memory
he
hated
it
but
nothing
concerning
norah
came
into
his
mind
sometimes
for
a
moment
a
blank
floated
across
it
behind
which
perhaps
was
norah
but
she
produced
no
image
on
it
he
could
not
even
recollect
her
face
he
did
not
know
what
she
was
like
there
was
the
horror
of
it
all
everything
in
the
world
but
she
had
the
vividness
of
nightmare
and
she
the
only
thing
that
did
not
belong
to
nightmare
had
gone
from
him
he
sat
there
alone
in
the
darkening
room
doing
nothing
as
far
as
definite
effort
went
and
yet
conscious
of
an
intense
internal
activity
in
just
looking
at
the
myriads
of
images
that
this
magic
lantern
of
the
mind
presented
to
him
now
for
a
little
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
contemplated
a
series
of
pictures
that
concerned
the
life
which
had
once
been
his
and
was
now
finished
and
rolled
up
done
with
for
ever
now
again
for
a
little
it
seemed
that
all
that
was
thus
presented
to
him
was
the
life
that
was
going
to
be
his
until
for
him
all
life
was
over
alice
would
always
be
sewing
slippers
his
wife
would
always
be
ordering
a
bit
of
salmon
he
would
always
be
sitting
in
an
empty
office
for
a
few
weeks
there
had
passed
across
those
eternal
reiterations
somebody
whose
very
face
he
could
not
now
recall
and
when
he
tried
to
imagine
her
he
could
see
nothing
but
a
blank
a
black
strip
where
words
had
been
erased
by
this
time
he
would
know
which
of
those
two
aspects
was
the
true
one
either
the
salmon
and
the
slippers
and
this
lonely
meditation
would
be
his
no
longer
or
they
would
be
all
that
he
could
call
his
he
felt
too
that
it
was
already
settled
which
it
was
to
be
fate
had
already
written
in
the
inexorable
book
and
had
closed
it
again
the
page
would
be
shown
him
he
would
read
what
was
inscribed
there
no
effort
on
his
part
no
imposition
of
his
will
no
power
of
his
to
organise
and
build
up
would
alter
it
though
the
crisis
was
yet
to
come
its
issue
was
already
determined
he
struggled
against
this
nightmare
sense
of
impotence
all
his
life
he
had
designed
his
own
career
in
bold
firm
strokes
and
fate
had
builded
as
he
had
planned
fate
was
not
a
predetermined
thing
the
book
of
destiny
was
written
by
the
resolute
and
strong
for
themselves
they
had
a
hand
on
the
pen
and
made
destiny
write
what
they
willed
it
should
be
so
he
had
but
to
determine
what
he
chose
should
be
and
this
was
the
hour
of
his
choice
suddenly
into
the
blanks
into
the
black
erasures
there
stole
the
images
which
just
now
he
had
tried
in
vain
to
recall
all
else
was
erased
and
norah
filled
the
empty
spaces
her
presence
voice
and
gesture
and
form
pervaded
his
whole
consciousness
there
was
room
for
nothing
else
they
loved
each
other
and
to
each
other
they
constituted
the
sum
of
all
that
was
real
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
accept
that
to
go
away
together
and
let
all
the
unrealities
of
life
the
cedars
the
salmon
the
slippers
pass
out
of
focus
be
dissolved
disintegrated
and
yet
and
yet
he
knew
that
he
did
not
make
the
choice
with
his
whole
self
deep
down
in
him
the
very
foundation
on
which
his
character
was
built
was
that
hidden
rock
of
his
integrity
of
his
stern
puritanism
of
the
morality
of
which
his
religion
was
made
he
was
willing
to
blow
that
up
he
searched
for
the
explosive
that
would
shatter
it
he
hacked
and
hammered
at
it
as
if
in
experiment
to
see
if
he
had
the
power
to
shatter
it
it
could
hardly
be
that
his
character
was
stronger
than
himself
that
seemed
a
contradiction
in
terms
and
yet
all
else
in
the
world
was
hateful
to
him
he
could
contemplate
life
neither
without
norah
nor
with
her
in
continuance
of
their
present
relations
this
afternoon
he
had
longed
for
her
to
go
away
and
when
she
had
gone
he
had
been
on
the
point
of
hurrying
down
like
a
madman
into
the
street
only
to
set
eyes
on
her
again
he
could
not
imagine
sitting
here
all
day
with
her
week
after
week
dictating
letters
hearing
her
typing
them
getting
the
clear
glance
from
her
now
and
again
and
that
would
be
the
most
intolerable
of
all
saying
to
her
when
the
day
s
work
was
done
and
to
her
when
it
was
beginning
something
must
happen
and
whatever
that
was
was
already
written
in
the
book
there
was
no
escape
the
clock
chimed
again
and
his
room
had
grown
so
dark
that
he
had
to
turn
on
the
electric
light
to
see
what
the
hour
was
he
went
downstairs
and
through
the
show
rooms
blazing
with
lights
still
populous
with
customers
into
the
square
the
toneless
blue
of
night
had
already
advanced
far
past
the
zenith
in
the
west
a
band
of
orange
marked
where
the
sun
had
set
and
just
above
it
was
a
space
of
delicate
pale
green
on
the
upper
edge
of
which
a
faint
star
twinkled
as
he
passed
between
the
hornbeam
hedges
in
the
disused
graveyard
the
odour
of
the
spring
night
of
dew
on
the
path
of
the
green
growth
on
the
trees
was
alert
in
the
air
the
mysterious
rapture
of
the
renewal
of
life
tingled
round
him
the
summons
to
expand
to
blossom
to
love
was
echoed
and
from
the
bushes
where
mated
birds
were
still
chirruping
as
he
walked
through
the
gathering
dusk
thick
with
the
choruses
of
spring
the
years
fell
from
him
like
withered
leaves
and
his
step
quickened
into
the
pace
of
youth
though
it
only
bore
him
to
the
cedars
and
the
amazing
futility
of
one
of
lady
keeling
s
smaller
two
very
auspicious
pieces
of
news
awaited
him
when
he
got
home
and
found
his
wife
and
alice
just
about
to
go
upstairs
to
dress
alice
s
slippers
had
come
back
from
the
s
and
could
be
presented
to
mr
silverdale
while
as
by
a
miracle
a
bit
of
salmon
had
been
procured
also
lady
keeling
had
been
driving
by
that
little
fishmonger
s
in
drury
place
and
there
on
the
marble
slab
was
quite
a
nice
bit
of
salmon
she
had
brought
it
home
herself
on
the
box
of
the
victoria
for
fear
of
there
being
any
mischance
as
to
its
delivery
alice
was
even
more
excited
for
nobody
else
had
ever
been
permitted
to
work
master
a
pair
of
slippers
and
julia
fyson
was
coming
to
dinner
who
with
eyes
green
with
jealousy
would
see
the
presentation
made
they
were
to
be
brought
into
the
at
the
end
of
dinner
when
lady
keeling
gave
two
short
pressures
to
the
electric
bell
that
stood
by
her
on
the
table
by
the
boy
covered
with
buttons
wrapped
round
with
endless
swathings
of
paper
he
was
to
present
this
bale
to
mr
silverdale
saying
that
it
was
immediate
and
asking
if
there
was
any
answer
would
it
not
be
fun
to
see
the
astonished
master
take
off
all
those
wrappings
and
find
the
maltese
crosses
within
this
entertaining
scheme
succeeded
admirably
alice
showed
a
remarkable
sense
of
dramatic
and
talked
very
eagerly
to
her
neighbour
while
mr
silverdale
stripped
off
layer
after
layer
of
paper
as
if
she
was
quite
unaware
that
anything
unusual
was
happening
and
it
was
not
till
an
unmistakable
shape
of
slippers
began
to
reveal
itself
in
the
core
that
master
guessed
it
s
my
helper
he
cried
my
sly
little
then
pushing
back
his
chair
he
took
off
his
evening
shoes
and
putting
on
the
slippers
went
solemnly
round
the
table
saying
to
each
of
his
hosts
and
may
i
introduce
you
to
my
slippers
but
when
he
came
to
alice
he
said
i
think
you
and
my
slippers
have
met
before
there
was
never
anything
so
deliciously
playful
but
when
he
had
padded
back
to
his
place
keeling
saw
poor
alice
s
eye
go
wandering
looking
at
every
one
in
turn
round
that
festive
table
except
master
finally
for
one
half
second
her
eye
rested
on
him
and
keeling
as
one
of
those
who
run
could
read
and
his
heart
went
out
to
poor
alice
she
was
prodigiously
silly
yet
that
one
glance
decorated
her
she
loved
and
that
distinguished
and
dignified
her
after
the
guests
had
gone
lady
keeling
launched
forth
into
her
usual
comments
on
the
success
of
her
well
i
m
sure
i
should
be
puzzled
to
name
a
pleasanter
evening
she
said
i
thought
it
all
quite
brilliant
though
i
m
sure
i
claim
no
share
in
its
success
except
that
i
do
think
i
gave
you
all
a
very
good
dinner
i
m
sure
i
never
tasted
a
better
bit
of
spring
salmon
than
that
was
it
not
lucky
it
caught
my
eye
this
afternoon
and
the
slippers
too
alice
it
was
quite
a
little
comedy
i
am
sure
i
have
seen
many
less
amusing
scenes
in
a
play
to
introduce
everybody
to
his
slippers
that
was
a
good
idea
and
it
must
have
been
quite
for
i
am
certain
he
did
not
know
what
was
inside
the
packet
till
he
came
to
the
last
perhaps
this
was
the
last
time
that
keeling
would
ever
listen
to
those
maunderings
that
would
be
determined
in
the
bluebell
wood
perhaps
evening
and
then
saying
to
alice
i
think
you
and
my
slippers
have
met
before
that
was
fun
was
it
not
i
saw
you
enjoyed
that
thomas
and
when
you
are
pleased
i
m
sure
the
joke
is
good
enough
for
anybody
i
wish
i
had
asked
lord
and
lady
inverbroom
to
dine
they
would
have
enjoyed
it
too
though
perhaps
he
would
feel
a
little
shy
of
meeting
you
after
that
snub
you
gave
him
and
his
club
in
taking
their
premises
away
from
would
the
bluebells
reflect
their
colour
on
to
her
face
as
the
daffodils
she
wore
one
day
had
done
by
the
way
no
word
had
been
said
about
the
hour
at
which
they
should
meet
but
it
did
not
matter
he
would
be
there
and
she
i
have
cancelled
the
notice
i
gave
them
he
said
you
will
not
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
club
furniture
coming
out
into
the
well
indeed
you
are
much
too
kind
to
them
after
what
they
did
to
you
thomas
i
am
sorry
you
did
that
they
deserved
a
good
slap
to
serve
them
an
awful
spirit
of
raillery
seized
the
unfortunate
woman
she
would
say
something
lightly
and
humorously
just
to
show
she
had
nothing
but
goodwill
towards
miss
propert
it
should
be
quite
in
that
felicitous
which
had
made
the
business
of
the
slippers
such
a
success
ah
but
now
i
remember
that
miss
propert
did
not
want
you
to
give
them
notice
she
said
now
we
can
guess
why
you
took
it
back
again
oh
not
a
word
more
i
am
discretion
even
this
did
not
hurt
him
he
was
rather
amused
than
otherwise
trust
you
for
hitting
the
nail
on
the
head
emmeline
he
said
that
was
lady
keeling
rose
in
great
good
humour
once
she
remembered
her
husband
had
been
very
rude
when
she
made
a
little
joke
about
his
regard
for
miss
propert
she
had
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
then
too
for
no
doubt
there
was
something
ever
so
little
of
truth
in
what
she
said
and
it
had
touched
him
but
now
he
did
not
mind
that
showed
that
there
was
no
truth
in
it
at
all
now
she
had
never
thought
there
was
anything
serious
for
thomas
was
not
that
sort
of
man
and
who
should
know
better
than
she
but
perhaps
he
had
been
a
little
attracted
she
was
delighted
to
think
that
it
was
certainly
all
over
ah
i
knew
i
had
guessed
she
said
and
perhaps
miss
propert
s
right
for
it
is
always
best
to
be
friendly
with
everybody
even
if
they
do
behave
shabbily
i
have
always
found
miss
propert
very
sensible
and
and
if
she
and
her
brother
are
coming
to
see
your
books
on
sunday
afternoon
thomas
and
you
like
to
bring
them
in
to
tea
you
will
find
me
most
civil
and
pleasant
to
them
both
there
and
now
i
think
alice
and
i
will
be
getting
to
bed
dear
me
it
s
after
eleven
already
time
flies
so
when
you
are
enjoying
she
gave
him
a
cheerful
kiss
she
tapped
the
barometer
and
taking
alice
in
tow
she
left
him
their
cheerful
voices
talking
about
the
slippers
died
away
as
they
went
upstairs
it
was
not
one
lark
but
many
that
were
carolling
specks
against
the
blue
as
keeling
walked
along
the
ridge
of
the
down
next
day
to
where
after
an
upland
mile
it
dipped
into
the
hollow
where
he
and
norah
had
met
before
and
where
they
would
meet
again
now
the
afternoon
was
warm
and
windless
and
the
squalls
and
showers
of
yesterday
had
been
translated
into
the
vivider
green
that
clothed
the
slopes
but
all
this
epiphany
of
spring
that
had
so
kindled
his
heart
before
passed
by
him
quite
unobserved
he
saw
only
the
tops
of
the
trees
which
climbing
up
on
the
sides
of
the
hollow
for
which
he
was
bound
fringed
the
edge
of
the
ridge
soon
he
had
reached
that
the
track
dipped
over
down
the
slope
and
on
each
side
between
the
and
the
stumps
of
the
felled
hazels
there
was
spread
one
continuous
sheet
of
azure
as
if
the
sky
had
flooded
the
ground
with
itself
but
he
hardly
saw
that
even
for
sitting
on
the
bank
where
at
the
bottom
of
the
hollow
the
stream
crossed
the
track
was
norah
she
had
watched
him
come
down
the
path
and
when
he
was
some
ten
paces
from
her
she
rose
she
had
no
word
it
would
seem
for
him
nor
he
for
her
and
they
stood
in
silence
opposite
each
other
but
the
clear
glance
shone
on
him
steady
and
quiet
and
complete
then
as
by
some
common
impulse
her
hands
and
his
were
clasped
together
just
norah
he
said
the
grave
smile
with
which
she
had
welcomed
him
grew
a
shade
graver
a
shade
more
tender
do
you
know
how
i
love
you
he
asked
yes
i
know
and
and
i
give
you
all
you
bring
me
you
know
that
don
t
you
again
by
some
common
impulse
they
moved
off
the
path
still
with
hands
clasped
they
walked
through
the
fallen
sky
of
bluebells
not
seeing
it
and
came
to
where
a
fallen
trunk
lopped
of
its
branches
lay
on
the
ground
we
will
sit
here
a
little
shall
we
she
said
it
mustn
t
be
why
not
for
ever
he
asked
you
know
that
too
she
said
at
that
moment
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
for
him
but
she
i
know
nothing
of
the
sort
he
said
we
belong
to
each
other
that
s
all
i
know
i
have
you
now
you
needn
t
think
i
shall
let
you
go
you
will
leave
that
damned
place
this
evening
with
me
that
s
the
only
reason
why
we
mustn
t
be
long
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
and
without
speaking
shook
her
head
but
it
is
to
be
so
he
cried
there
s
no
other
way
out
we
ve
found
each
other
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
let
us
lose
each
other
there
is
no
other
even
as
he
spoke
that
silent
inexorable
tug
that
irresistible
tide
of
character
which
sweeps
up
against
all
of
impulse
which
do
not
flow
with
it
began
to
move
within
him
he
meant
all
he
said
and
yet
he
knew
that
it
was
not
to
be
and
as
he
looked
at
her
he
saw
in
her
eyes
that
fathomless
eternal
pity
which
is
as
much
a
part
of
love
as
is
desire
there
is
no
way
out
there
she
said
look
into
yourself
and
tell
me
if
you
really
believe
there
is
the
way
is
barred
you
yourself
bar
it
how
could
i
then
pass
over
it
if
you
loved
me
he
began
ah
hush
don
t
say
that
it
is
nonsense
wicked
nonsense
isn
t
it
yes
he
said
she
was
infinitely
stronger
than
he
a
dozen
times
in
details
she
had
proved
that
now
when
there
was
no
detail
but
a
vital
issue
at
stake
she
could
show
all
her
strength
instead
of
but
sparring
with
him
well
then
listen
she
said
we
are
honest
folk
my
dear
both
you
and
i
you
are
under
certain
obligations
you
have
a
wife
and
children
and
since
i
love
you
i
am
under
the
same
obligations
they
are
yours
and
therefore
they
are
mine
if
it
weren
t
for
them
but
it
is
no
use
thinking
of
but
i
repudiate
them
he
said
they
have
become
meaningless
you
are
the
only
thing
which
means
anything
to
me
norah
norah
thou
beside
me
singing
in
the
wilderness
what
else
is
there
what
else
his
passion
had
lifted
him
upon
his
feet
he
stood
there
before
her
strong
and
masterful
he
was
accustomed
always
to
get
his
way
he
would
get
it
now
in
spite
of
the
tide
against
which
his
impulse
struggled
in
spite
of
her
who
was
sailing
up
on
the
tide
there
is
nothing
else
she
said
but
there
is
not
he
knelt
down
on
the
ground
by
her
but
my
darling
he
said
it
is
not
our
fault
it
happened
like
that
god
gave
us
hearts
did
he
not
and
are
we
just
to
disobey
what
our
hearts
tell
us
we
belong
to
each
other
what
else
can
we
do
are
we
to
eat
our
hearts
out
you
on
one
side
of
the
table
in
that
hell
upstairs
i
on
the
other
don
t
tell
me
that
is
the
way
out
she
raised
her
hands
and
let
them
lie
with
strong
pressure
on
his
shoulders
no
there
is
no
way
out
there
she
said
i
couldn
t
stand
that
nor
could
you
but
there
is
a
way
out
and
you
and
i
are
going
to
take
again
the
infinite
pity
of
her
strength
welled
up
and
dimmed
her
eyes
i
am
going
away
she
said
i
shall
leave
bracebridge
it
s
all
he
shook
himself
free
of
her
hands
we
go
together
then
he
said
but
there
was
no
conviction
in
his
voice
it
was
but
a
despairing
drowning
cry
she
made
a
little
gesture
with
her
head
come
back
here
she
said
let
me
put
my
hands
on
your
shoulders
again
yes
just
like
that
it
is
all
settled
charles
agrees
he
knows
enough
i
think
he
guesses
the
rest
i
shall
go
back
to
london
and
get
work
there
i
shall
find
it
perfectly
easy
to
do
that
if
you
will
give
me
a
little
testimonial
it
would
help
me
you
mustn
t
come
to
see
me
you
mustn
t
write
to
me
i
won
t
say
anything
so
foolish
as
to
tell
you
to
forget
me
you
can
t
to
begin
with
and
also
i
don
t
want
you
to
i
want
you
to
remember
me
always
with
love
and
with
honour
she
stopped
for
a
moment
smiling
at
him
through
her
tears
you
made
me
cry
two
mornings
ago
she
said
and
i
felt
so
ashamed
of
myself
i
don
t
feel
ashamed
of
myself
now
i
i
am
rather
proud
of
myself
and
i
want
you
to
be
proud
of
her
voice
broke
utterly
and
she
sat
with
her
head
in
her
hands
sobbing
her
heart
out
presently
with
one
hand
she
felt
for
his
and
sat
thus
clasping
it
sit
by
me
she
said
at
length
and
very
soon
we
must
walk
back
over
the
down
and
when
we
come
to
the
skylark
s
nest
you
shall
go
on
and
i
will
follow
after
a
few
minutes
let
s
go
through
these
few
months
as
if
pasting
them
into
our
memories
we
must
each
have
the
same
remembrance
as
the
other
i
hated
you
at
first
do
you
know
i
hated
working
for
you
the
books
began
to
bring
us
together
the
mischievous
things
then
there
came
the
for
your
but
you
apologised
and
then
came
the
catalogue
was
not
that
it
by
that
time
i
had
got
to
love
working
for
you
though
i
did
not
guess
at
once
what
was
the
matter
with
me
then
came
the
spring
day
that
first
day
of
real
spring
and
i
knew
and
there
is
one
thing
i
want
to
ask
you
did
lord
inverbroom
ever
tell
you
about
my
people
no
well
you
might
like
to
know
my
father
was
a
great
friend
of
his
at
one
time
but
he
went
off
with
another
woman
deserting
my
mother
that
was
another
reason
why
we
have
settled
our
affairs
as
we
have
settled
them
i
thought
i
would
like
to
tell
you
that
we
can
t
bring
on
others
the
misery
they
she
put
her
hand
through
the
crook
of
his
arm
look
she
said
we
came
to
see
the
bluebells
and
we
have
never
noticed
them
till
now
did
i
not
say
they
would
be
a
carpet
spread
under
the
trees
shall
we
pick
some
i
should
like
to
leave
a
bunch
at
the
hospital
on
my
way
very
soon
her
hands
were
full
of
them
and
she
tied
her
handkerchief
round
their
juicy
stems
we
must
go
she
said
but
there
will
be
bluebells
in
my
heart
all
my
they
walked
together
up
the
slope
on
to
the
down
and
along
the
ridge
as
they
got
near
to
the
end
of
it
where
it
plunged
down
again
towards
bracebridge
their
pace
grew
slower
and
at
last
they
stopped
altogether
it
is
she
said
and
quite
simply
like
a
child
she
raised
her
face
to
his
he
went
on
alone
after
that
and
she
sat
down
on
the
turf
to
wait
as
she
had
done
before
with
her
bunch
of
bluebells
beside
her
she
kept
her
eyes
on
his
receding
figure
and
just
before
it
passed
downwards
out
of
sight
he
turned
as
she
knew
he
would
do
a
moment
afterwards
he
had
disappeared
late
that
night
he
was
sitting
alone
in
his
library
the
evening
had
passed
precisely
as
it
always
did
when
he
and
his
wife
and
alice
were
by
themselves
lady
keeling
had
been
neither
more
nor
less
fatuous
than
usual
alice
the
slippers
being
off
her
mind
had
played
a
couple
of
games
of
backgammon
with
him
and
had
shown
herself
as
futile
an
adversary
as
ever
norah
had
gone
that
fact
was
indelibly
imprinted
on
his
mind
but
as
yet
it
aroused
no
emotion
it
had
produced
no
sense
of
desolation
in
him
all
the
strainings
of
doubt
and
desire
which
had
racked
him
before
were
dead
the
suspense
was
over
his
love
would
enjoy
no
fruition
and
he
had
been
all
evening
exactly
as
is
the
man
who
has
been
condemned
to
be
hung
and
now
though
he
has
passed
a
month
of
sleeplessness
or
nightmare
has
no
anxiety
to
torture
him
and
for
that
first
night
after
his
trial
is
over
can
rest
in
the
certainty
of
the
worst
and
the
uttermost
several
times
this
evening
keeling
had
probed
into
his
own
heart
pricking
it
with
the
reminder
of
the
knowledge
that
she
had
left
him
but
no
response
no
wail
or
cry
of
pain
had
come
from
it
his
heart
knew
it
and
there
was
no
use
in
repeating
the
news
his
heart
had
received
it
and
lay
there
beating
quietly
and
steadily
meantime
all
his
went
on
with
no
less
vividness
than
was
their
wont
there
was
alice
making
her
usual
mistakes
over
the
moves
of
the
pieces
there
was
lady
keeling
alternating
between
drowsiness
and
volubility
her
fat
face
wrinkled
and
bulged
on
one
side
when
her
head
fell
a
little
crooked
as
she
dozed
it
became
symmetrical
again
when
she
recovered
herself
and
talked
on
her
invariable
topics
lord
inverbroom
dinner
her
engagements
as
lady
mayoress
mr
silverdale
and
so
forth
she
alluded
again
to
her
husband
s
magnanimity
in
not
turning
out
the
county
club
from
their
premises
she
even
introduced
norah
s
name
and
endorsed
her
expressed
intention
to
be
polite
to
her
if
she
came
in
to
tea
on
sunday
when
necessary
he
replied
quite
so
my
dear
but
nothing
reached
him
it
was
perfectly
easy
now
to
be
polite
and
patient
he
was
locked
up
somewhere
inside
himself
and
sparrows
were
twittering
in
the
bushes
far
outside
this
absolute
numbness
came
with
him
into
his
library
where
he
went
when
his
wife
and
daughter
on
the
warning
of
the
pink
clock
proceeded
upstairs
after
the
usual
kisses
he
did
not
want
to
wake
his
sensibilities
up
simply
because
he
did
not
want
anything
even
here
in
his
secret
garden
all
he
saw
round
him
was
meaningless
his
library
was
a
big
pleasant
room
and
he
wondered
why
he
had
kept
it
so
sacredly
remote
from
his
wife
and
alice
there
were
some
books
in
it
of
course
hugh
had
got
a
mercantile
idea
from
one
alice
had
been
a
little
shy
of
an
illustration
in
another
and
for
some
reason
he
had
felt
that
these
attitudes
were
not
tuned
to
the
spirit
he
found
here
but
there
was
no
spirit
of
any
kind
here
and
alice
might
be
shocked
if
she
chose
hugh
might
pick
up
hints
for
the
printing
of
advertisements
his
wife
might
put
the
leonardo
volume
in
her
chair
if
she
did
not
find
it
high
enough
and
if
that
did
not
give
her
the
desirable
position
in
which
to
doze
most
comfortably
there
was
the
catalogue
ready
to
make
her
a
footstool
books
books
they
were
all
strange
and
silly
in
some
there
were
pictures
over
which
he
had
pored
in
others
there
were
verses
that
had
haunted
his
memory
as
with
magic
and
all
had
a
certain
perfection
about
them
whether
in
print
or
page
or
binding
or
picture
that
had
once
satisfied
and
intoxicated
a
certain
desire
for
beauty
that
he
had
once
felt
there
they
were
on
their
shelves
there
was
the
catalogue
that
described
them
and
the
shelves
were
full
of
corpses
and
the
catalogue
was
like
a
column
of
deaths
in
the
daily
paper
of
some
remote
individuals
that
concerned
him
no
more
than
the
victims
of
a
plague
in
ethiopia
it
was
hot
in
here
except
in
summer
a
fire
was
always
lit
in
the
evening
to
keep
damp
out
unless
he
it
and
he
drew
up
the
blind
and
opened
the
french
window
that
gave
on
to
the
garden
an
oblong
of
light
cast
itself
outside
and
in
it
he
saw
a
row
of
daffodils
that
bordered
the
lawn
across
the
gravel
path
nodding
in
the
night
wind
they
were
very
yellow
they
would
cast
yellow
reflections
on
anything
near
them
then
awoke
hunger
in
his
heart
and
it
screamed
out
to
him
starving
perhaps
she
had
not
gone
perhaps
she
like
himself
had
experienced
a
numbness
of
the
heart
that
made
her
feel
that
she
did
not
care
he
had
been
stupid
and
this
afternoon
he
had
not
shown
her
the
depth
of
his
passion
he
had
not
her
listen
to
him
he
had
not
done
that
it
was
that
she
was
waiting
for
eager
to
be
overmastered
to
be
made
unable
to
resist
surely
she
had
not
gone
he
let
himself
out
of
the
remembering
how
but
a
few
months
ago
he
had
done
just
that
on
a
night
of
snow
now
as
then
he
wanted
to
be
sure
that
she
was
safe
at
home
but
now
not
as
then
he
would
not
content
himself
with
seeing
the
light
behind
the
blind
he
must
see
her
he
must
make
her
understand
that
they
only
existed
for
each
other
certainly
she
had
not
gone
away
certainly
she
was
waiting
exactly
for
this
she
would
be
there
still
he
would
make
her
feel
the
impossibility
of
any
solution
but
this
she
would
bow
to
his
indomitable
force
she
would
recognise
it
and
consent
with
her
whole
heart
to
endorse
it
to
come
away
with
him
and
cut
the
knot
and
find
all
that
god
meant
them
to
be
to
each
other
the
empty
streets
streamed
by
him
and
it
seemed
that
the
earth
seemed
to
be
swiftly
spinning
below
him
he
just
marked
time
as
it
turned
the
of
spring
both
cooled
and
intoxicated
him
he
felt
surer
and
surer
of
the
success
of
his
errand
as
he
went
and
at
the
same
time
practical
considerations
occurred
to
him
her
brother
would
be
in
the
house
it
was
still
not
late
and
probably
they
would
be
together
charles
understood
enough
so
she
had
told
him
to
make
him
sanction
her
departure
now
when
keeling
had
seen
her
he
would
understand
more
charles
perhaps
would
open
the
door
to
him
for
their
two
servants
would
have
gone
to
bed
or
be
out
for
saturday
night
and
keeling
would
say
to
him
i
must
see
your
that
was
what
he
would
say
and
charles
understanding
enough
would
see
the
justice
of
that
demand
of
love
he
came
opposite
the
house
and
his
heart
leaped
for
there
was
a
light
behind
her
he
had
known
there
would
be
and
he
almost
shouted
for
exultation
at
the
fulfilment
of
his
anticipation
of
course
she
had
not
gone
she
was
waiting
just
for
this
swiftly
and
jubilantly
he
crossed
the
road
at
the
sight
of
that
lit
blind
all
the
awakening
pangs
of
his
heart
had
passed
from
him
even
as
at
the
sight
of
the
nodding
daffodils
had
passed
the
apathy
that
encompassed
it
before
his
intolerance
of
his
wife
the
dreaminess
of
his
purposeless
existence
ceased
to
be
on
the
other
hand
his
secret
garden
now
that
the
gardener
who
had
made
it
sacred
was
waiting
for
him
bloomed
again
in
an
everlasting
spring
in
answer
to
his
ring
which
he
heard
faintly
tinkling
inside
there
came
steps
on
the
stairs
and
the
dark
over
the
door
leaped
into
brightness
as
some
one
turned
on
the
switch
then
the
door
opened
and
as
he
had
expected
there
was
charles
sir
thomas
he
said
won
t
you
come
in
i
answered
the
door
myself
the
servants
have
gone
to
bed
what
can
i
do
for
you
sir
it
was
all
happening
exactly
as
keeling
had
anticipated
and
he
laughed
for
joy
as
he
stepped
inside
i
want
to
see
your
sister
for
a
minute
he
said
we
did
not
quite
finish
our
talk
this
charles
looked
at
him
rather
curiously
and
keeling
wondered
whether
some
doubt
as
to
his
sobriety
had
crossed
the
young
man
s
mind
the
idea
amused
him
but
my
sister
has
gone
sir
he
said
surely
you
know
keeling
closed
the
into
the
street
ah
yes
and
left
her
room
lit
he
said
joking
with
him
out
of
sheer
happiness
i
was
in
her
room
said
charles
i
was
packing
some
things
which
she
had
not
time
enough
to
pack
for
a
moment
it
seemed
to
keeling
that
the
light
and
the
walls
and
the
floor
quivered
nonsense
propert
he
said
and
his
voice
quivered
too
perhaps
you
would
like
to
come
up
and
see
for
yourself
sir
said
charles
keeling
looked
at
him
with
perfectly
blank
eyes
do
you
really
mean
she
has
gone
he
asked
yes
sir
i
felt
sure
you
understood
that
she
said
she
had
told
he
had
grasped
the
back
of
a
chair
that
stood
near
him
and
leaned
on
it
heavily
then
recovering
his
steadiness
he
spoke
again
kindly
give
me
her
address
then
he
said
she
wanted
me
to
write
her
a
testimonial
which
i
am
happy
to
do
she
was
a
very
efficient
secretary
i
have
nothing
but
praise
for
her
i
will
send
it
her
she
spoke
to
me
of
that
said
charles
and
asked
that
you
would
send
it
to
me
to
forward
to
her
but
i
can
t
give
you
her
address
without
her
express
but
what
nonsense
this
is
said
keeling
angrily
as
if
i
couldn
t
find
her
in
a
week
for
i
trust
you
will
attempt
to
do
no
such
thing
sir
said
charles
and
do
you
presume
to
dictate
to
me
what
i
shall
do
and
what
i
shall
not
asked
he
charles
looked
at
him
with
some
shadow
of
the
pity
he
had
seen
in
norah
s
eyes
i
don
t
dictate
to
you
at
all
he
said
i
only
remind
you
of
norah
s
and
do
you
agree
with
them
do
you
approve
of
her
mad
freak
in
running
off
like
this
yes
sir
as
far
as
i
understand
what
has
happened
i
do
approve
i
think
it
was
the
only
honest
course
left
suddenly
keeling
s
anger
evaporated
leaving
only
a
sore
throbbing
place
where
it
had
burned
i
hope
she
s
not
not
very
unhappy
he
said
he
could
not
help
saying
that
he
had
to
speak
of
her
to
somebody
she
is
utterly
miserable
said
charles
it
couldn
t
be
otherwise
could
it
and
you
are
miserable
too
sir
i
am
i
am
awfully
sorry
for
you
both
but
i
suppose
that
has
got
to
be
norah
could
do
nothing
else
than
what
she
has
keeling
sank
down
in
the
chair
on
which
he
had
been
leaning
he
felt
completely
tired
out
do
you
think
she
will
allow
me
to
see
her
or
write
to
her
he
asked
not
for
a
long
time
but
there
is
no
harm
in
my
telling
you
this
she
wants
me
to
tell
her
how
you
are
she
hopes
sir
that
you
will
make
yourself
very
busy
that
s
the
best
thing
to
do
isn
t
it
keeling
had
no
reply
to
this
the
apathy
of
intense
fatigue
of
an
excitement
and
anticipation
suddenly
nullified
was
blunting
the
sharp
edges
of
his
misery
for
a
little
while
he
sat
there
with
his
head
in
his
hands
then
slowly
and
stiffly
he
got
up
looking
bent
and
old
i
am
sorry
that
i
asked
you
for
her
address
he
said
i
will
be
going
home
and
you
must
get
back
to
your
packing
the
world
had
ceased
spinning
for
him
as
he
walked
back
he
lifted
heavy
feet
as
if
he
was
going
up
some
steep
interminable
hill
chapter
xi
keeling
went
to
his
office
on
the
following
monday
morning
with
his
mind
already
made
up
about
the
extension
of
his
business
he
had
an
option
on
a
big
building
site
at
the
neighbouring
manufacturing
town
of
nalesborough
and
this
he
determined
to
exercise
at
once
and
have
put
in
hand
without
delay
the
erection
of
his
new
premises
his
trade
seemed
to
have
reached
its
mark
here
in
bracebridge
but
the
creation
of
a
similar
business
elsewhere
would
occupy
him
for
a
dozen
years
yet
and
what
was
more
to
his
immediate
purpose
give
him
a
piece
of
critically
important
work
now
last
summer
he
had
more
than
half
resolved
to
turn
the
bracebridge
stores
into
a
company
and
leaving
hugh
as
the
director
himself
retire
from
business
and
enjoy
among
his
books
the
leisure
of
which
all
his
life
he
had
had
so
little
now
his
one
desire
was
to
set
this
new
enterprise
going
and
thereby
gain
for
himself
not
the
leisure
that
lately
he
coveted
but
the
absorption
which
he
hoped
the
work
of
organisation
would
bring
him
it
would
be
an
immense
task
and
that
was
why
he
undertook
it
for
he
had
no
desire
any
more
for
unoccupied
hours
in
which
he
could
browse
in
the
pastures
of
his
secret
garden
what
he
wanted
was
work
work
of
the
kind
that
kept
him
so
busy
all
day
that
he
had
no
further
energy
left
for
thought
he
proposed
to
continue
directing
the
course
of
his
bracebridge
business
also
with
these
two
to
superintend
he
surely
would
find
stupefaction
for
those
bees
of
the
brain
whose
bitter
he
had
no
use
for
he
had
made
an
excursion
into
fairy
land
that
was
how
he
framed
the
matter
to
himself
there
had
been
the
cedars
and
work
for
him
before
there
would
be
work
and
the
cedars
for
him
afterwards
those
who
have
drunk
of
the
metheglin
never
perhaps
afterwards
are
wholly
free
from
the
reminiscence
of
the
sweet
draught
brewed
magically
from
the
heather
and
the
honey
but
they
go
back
after
their
sojourn
among
the
little
people
and
behave
like
ordinary
mortals
again
and
eat
the
bread
and
move
about
their
appointed
ways
but
the
nights
and
days
they
have
spent
in
the
secret
places
of
the
earth
will
till
they
die
be
more
vivid
to
them
than
all
the
actual
experiences
that
they
go
through
afterwards
and
went
through
before
they
penetrated
the
enchanted
glen
the
remembrance
will
colour
their
idle
moments
with
the
ensanguined
hue
of
dream
that
baseless
fabric
that
vision
of
hidden
doors
thrown
open
and
the
things
that
lurk
within
is
more
rich
just
because
to
them
it
is
more
real
than
the
sober
tonelessness
of
their
profession
or
pursuit
therefore
if
they
are
wise
the
best
thing
they
can
do
is
like
prospero
to
drown
the
magic
book
beneath
the
waters
of
absorbing
employment
often
it
will
float
up
again
to
the
surface
and
each
time
it
must
be
prodded
back
with
averted
eyes
so
for
keeling
a
love
that
could
not
be
realised
once
crowned
the
of
his
nature
now
that
citadel
and
the
very
themselves
had
been
shaken
down
and
strewn
over
the
plains
he
had
now
one
paramount
need
that
of
forgetting
and
since
he
could
not
forget
the
need
resolved
itself
into
the
effort
to
remember
as
little
as
possible
to
use
up
in
other
ways
the
energy
which
was
his
and
the
leisure
that
he
could
command
if
he
chose
he
let
himself
into
his
office
where
his
letters
were
already
being
opened
by
the
girl
he
had
sent
for
to
take
over
norah
s
work
on
the
little
table
by
the
window
there
still
stood
norah
s
typewriting
machine
which
it
appeared
she
had
altogether
forgotten
her
brother
must
be
asked
to
take
it
away
by
it
was
the
pile
of
letters
which
dealt
with
businesses
not
yet
concluded
all
were
in
order
with
dockets
of
the
affairs
contained
in
them
probably
before
she
quitted
the
office
for
the
last
time
on
friday
afternoon
she
had
foreseen
that
she
would
not
return
and
had
left
everything
so
that
her
successor
might
take
up
the
work
without
difficulty
nothing
was
omitted
or
left
vague
she
had
finished
everything
with
the
most
meticulous
care
he
searched
through
these
papers
to
see
if
there
was
any
private
word
for
him
but
there
was
nothing
this
was
office
work
and
such
private
words
as
she
had
for
him
had
all
been
said
in
the
bluebell
wood
her
successor
a
rasping
young
woman
with
strong
knuckles
proved
herself
very
efficient
and
before
long
she
retired
to
the
small
room
adjoining
with
her
sheaf
of
shorthand
notes
her
typewriting
machine
was
already
installed
there
and
soon
the
clack
of
the
keys
proclaimed
her
a
swift
worker
for
a
few
minutes
only
the
sound
worried
him
there
was
a
new
touch
a
new
note
one
that
meant
nothing
to
him
except
that
it
told
him
that
his
work
was
going
forward
to
get
accustomed
to
but
very
soon
he
was
absorbed
in
the
mass
of
affairs
which
his
new
venture
brought
with
it
there
was
twelve
years
work
before
him
here
he
was
in
the
first
hour
of
it
it
stretched
endlessly
away
but
he
gave
no
attention
to
the
enormous
perspective
all
he
desired
was
to
attend
to
the
immediate
foreground
he
would
progress
inch
by
inch
detail
by
detail
till
the
perspective
began
to
grow
he
would
look
neither
forwards
nor
backwards
he
left
his
office
late
that
night
after
a
long
day
s
uninterrupted
work
and
still
busy
with
some
problem
took
without
thinking
the
path
through
the
cathedral
graveyard
which
farther
on
led
past
the
house
where
norah
had
lived
but
before
he
got
there
he
remembered
and
turned
off
so
as
to
avoid
it
and
then
he
paused
and
retraced
his
steps
again
was
it
weak
to
avoid
it
or
was
it
weak
to
let
himself
walk
by
it
perhaps
the
stronger
course
was
just
to
get
used
to
it
sometime
perhaps
he
would
be
able
to
go
by
it
without
noticing
it
was
already
the
when
he
arrived
home
and
he
went
into
his
wife
s
boudoir
to
tell
her
to
begin
without
waiting
for
him
to
his
astonishment
he
found
her
not
yet
dressed
and
as
he
entered
she
hastily
picked
up
her
handkerchief
which
was
on
the
floor
and
applied
it
to
her
eyes
why
emmeline
what
s
the
matter
he
said
she
did
not
seem
to
him
to
be
actually
crying
but
the
ritual
of
crying
was
there
and
had
to
be
respected
oh
my
dear
thomas
you
haven
t
heard
the
terrible
news
then
she
said
i
thought
you
would
be
sure
to
have
seen
it
placarded
somewhere
alice
went
straight
to
her
room
and
i
haven
t
seen
her
since
though
i
repeatedly
knocked
at
the
door
which
she
has
locked
on
the
inside
and
i
m
sure
it
s
most
unnatural
of
her
not
to
let
her
own
mother
comfort
her
it
all
happened
in
a
moment
i
have
always
said
those
great
shouldn
t
be
allowed
to
career
about
the
streets
especially
when
they
are
all
paved
with
cobbles
as
they
are
at
easton
haven
which
are
so
slippery
when
it
s
wet
he
slipped
and
it
went
over
him
in
a
will
you
please
tell
me
whom
it
went
over
asked
keeling
as
his
wife
paused
for
a
second
why
poor
mr
silverdale
and
to
think
that
it
was
only
last
friday
that
we
had
such
fun
over
the
slippers
i
declare
i
shall
never
want
to
see
a
slipper
again
he
was
crushed
to
a
jelly
and
i
m
sure
i
hope
the
driver
will
be
well
hung
for
it
though
they
are
certain
to
prove
that
it
wasn
t
his
fault
which
is
so
easy
now
that
poor
mr
silverdale
can
t
give
his
account
of
the
matter
it
was
all
over
in
a
moment
though
i
know
quite
well
you
didn
t
like
him
and
said
many
sarcastic
things
about
him
and
the
young
ladies
whom
he
inspired
i
m
sure
i
never
said
a
hard
thing
about
him
nor
thought
it
either
though
he
didn
t
ask
alice
to
be
his
wife
but
i
am
convinced
he
would
have
if
he
had
been
spared
that
s
one
comfort
if
only
he
had
all
this
might
have
been
avoided
for
they
would
be
on
their
honeymoon
now
let
me
see
february
march
april
or
if
they
had
come
back
he
wouldn
t
have
wanted
to
set
out
on
this
mission
just
yet
and
so
the
van
wouldn
t
have
been
there
and
what
are
we
all
to
do
now
these
pathetic
reflections
had
the
effect
of
really
working
on
lady
keeling
s
feelings
and
her
throat
tied
itself
into
knots
his
shepherd
s
crook
she
said
all
his
delightful
ways
though
as
i
say
you
never
liked
him
the
muffins
he
has
eaten
sitting
on
the
floor
before
this
very
fire
the
way
he
used
to
run
like
a
boy
the
gregorian
chants
which
he
used
to
call
so
ripping
all
that
beautiful
music
i
declare
i
shall
never
want
to
go
to
church
again
and
pray
what
are
we
to
do
now
what
s
to
happen
to
alice
if
she
won
t
unlock
her
the
best
thing
we
can
do
is
to
leave
alice
alone
for
the
present
he
said
i
ll
go
up
to
her
after
she
won
t
see
you
said
lady
keeling
confidently
she
wouldn
t
see
me
who
have
always
been
so
sympathetic
about
mr
silverdale
so
what
chance
is
there
of
her
seeing
you
that
is
what
i
shall
find
out
now
it
s
late
already
i
have
been
detained
at
the
office
so
let
us
go
into
dinner
as
we
lady
keeling
sighed
i
couldn
t
eat
a
morsel
she
said
though
i
know
it
is
the
duty
of
all
of
us
to
keep
our
strength
up
there
is
hare
soup
too
he
was
so
fond
of
hare
soup
but
i
must
run
upstairs
first
and
put
on
a
black
or
something
i
could
not
sit
down
to
table
without
some
little
token
of
respect
like
lady
keeling
performed
this
duty
of
keeping
her
strength
up
with
her
usual
conscientiousness
and
after
dinner
her
husband
sent
a
note
up
to
alice
saying
that
he
would
be
alone
in
his
library
if
she
would
like
to
come
down
while
they
were
still
in
the
over
coffee
the
answer
came
back
that
she
would
do
so
and
presently
he
went
in
there
while
lady
keeling
in
a
great
state
of
mystification
as
to
how
alice
could
want
to
see
her
father
went
back
in
what
may
be
called
dudgeon
to
the
plush
and
mirrors
of
the
it
seemed
to
her
very
unnatural
conduct
on
alice
s
part
but
no
doubt
the
poor
girl
s
head
was
so
turned
with
grief
that
she
hardly
knew
what
she
was
doing
her
mother
could
think
of
no
other
possible
explanation
she
indulged
in
a
variety
of
conjectures
about
the
funeral
and
presently
exhausted
by
these
imaginative
efforts
fell
asleep
keeling
when
he
went
into
his
library
found
alice
already
there
sitting
limply
in
front
of
the
fire
she
turned
round
when
her
father
entered
and
fixed
on
him
a
perfectly
vacant
and
meaningless
stare
till
then
he
had
no
notion
what
he
should
say
to
her
now
when
he
saw
that
blank
tragic
gaze
he
knew
there
was
no
necessity
to
think
at
all
he
understood
her
completely
for
he
knew
what
it
was
to
lose
everything
that
his
soul
desired
and
his
heart
went
out
to
her
in
a
manner
it
had
never
done
before
she
sat
there
helpless
with
her
grief
and
only
some
one
like
himself
helpless
also
could
reach
her
her
silliness
her
excited
fussinesses
had
been
stripped
off
her
and
he
saw
the
simplicity
of
her
desolation
from
him
had
fallen
his
hardness
and
in
him
she
divined
a
man
who
for
some
reason
could
reach
her
and
be
with
her
before
he
had
walked
across
the
room
to
her
her
expression
changed
there
came
some
sort
of
human
gleam
behind
the
blankness
of
her
eyes
and
she
rose
father
she
said
and
then
she
ran
to
him
stumbling
over
her
dress
and
put
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
that
grim
mouth
which
she
had
always
thought
so
forbidding
and
unsympathetic
suddenly
wore
to
her
a
perfectly
new
aspect
it
was
strong
and
tender
my
dear
he
said
i
am
so
glad
you
have
let
me
come
to
you
you
are
in
deep
waters
poor
i
loved
him
she
said
i
know
you
did
that
s
why
you
re
right
to
come
to
me
i
can
understand
i
can
t
do
anything
for
you
except
understand
i
ve
loved
too
i
ve
lost
too
i
know
what
it
s
i
felt
you
did
i
don
t
know
why
she
said
well
you
felt
right
we
re
together
my
since
she
had
heard
the
news
she
had
sat
and
motionless
in
her
bedroom
now
in
the
sense
of
a
companionship
that
comprehended
the
relief
of
tears
came
and
with
head
buried
on
his
shoulder
she
clung
to
him
while
the
storm
raged
he
just
let
her
feel
the
pressure
of
his
arm
and
for
the
rest
stood
there
braced
and
firm
in
body
and
steadfast
soul
there
was
none
who
could
help
him
but
comfortless
himself
he
could
comfort
and
he
waited
with
that
live
and
infinite
patience
which
is
the
gift
only
of
the
strong
and
masterful
there
my
dear
he
said
at
length
you
have
cried
enough
and
you
re
better
for
it
now
you
re
going
to
be
very
good
and
dry
your
eyes
and
sit
down
again
by
the
fire
while
i
fetch
you
something
to
eat
you
ve
had
i
couldn
t
eat
she
said
oh
yes
you
could
now
do
just
as
i
tell
you
alice
when
you
ve
eaten
we
ll
talk
quietly
and
firmly
he
disengaged
her
arm
from
his
and
putting
her
into
her
chair
again
he
presently
returned
bringing
a
tray
for
her
then
gently
insisting
he
made
her
eat
and
drink
ought
i
to
see
mother
she
asked
at
length
just
wish
her
when
you
go
upstairs
i
m
going
to
pack
you
off
to
bed
in
half
an
but
she
won
t
talk
and
cry
and
and
not
understand
asked
alice
no
she
shan
t
talk
and
cry
i
ll
take
care
of
that
i
ll
act
policeman
but
i
can
t
promise
you
that
she
ll
understand
i
should
think
nothing
more
alice
had
a
faint
smile
for
this
i
never
knew
you
before
father
she
said
no
but
we
must
try
to
be
friends
alice
moved
aside
the
table
which
carried
her
tray
you
never
liked
him
she
said
how
is
it
you
can
help
me
like
this
how
can
you
understand
if
you
didn
t
like
him
i
know
you
did
that
is
all
that
concerns
yes
but
you
thought
him
silly
and
you
thought
me
he
smiled
at
her
yes
i
often
thought
you
both
extraordinarily
silly
if
you
will
have
it
so
he
said
but
i
respect
alice
s
face
began
slowly
to
get
misshapen
and
knotted
he
spoke
to
her
rather
firmly
don
t
begin
crying
again
alice
he
said
you
ve
had
your
but
it
s
all
so
hopeless
there
s
nothing
left
for
me
all
the
things
we
planned
together
he
interrupted
you
ve
got
to
carry
them
out
alone
set
yourself
to
do
them
my
dear
don
t
leave
out
one
that
s
the
thing
make
yourself
busy
occupy
he
got
up
speaking
to
himself
as
much
as
to
her
that
s
what
we
have
both
got
to
do
he
said
we
ve
got
to
work
instead
of
snivelling
we
ve
got
to
set
our
teeth
and
go
ahead
i
m
going
to
be
busier
than
i
ve
been
for
years
i
m
going
to
start
a
new
stores
in
nalesborough
and
see
after
them
and
the
stores
here
but
you
were
thinking
of
giving
up
your
business
altogether
said
she
i
was
but
i
have
reconsidered
that
i
m
going
to
be
busier
than
ever
let
us
see
which
of
us
can
be
the
busiest
i
can
t
forget
nor
can
you
but
we
can
leave
as
little
time
as
possible
for
suddenly
their
rôles
were
reversed
and
she
found
herself
in
the
position
of
sympathiser
if
not
comforter
but
i
thought
you
were
so
full
of
energy
and
happiness
she
said
what
has
happened
nothing
that
i
can
tell
you
he
said
i
didn
t
mean
to
speak
of
she
got
up
too
poor
father
she
said
i
m
sorry
whatever
it
thank
you
my
dear
don
t
try
to
guess
and
now
i
ll
take
you
in
to
your
mother
just
to
say
she
shan
t
bother
you
and
we
ve
got
to
bite
on
the
bullet
a
few
minutes
later
he
returned
alone
to
his
library
all
round
him
were
the
shelves
now
packed
from
floor
to
ceiling
with
book
cases
half
filled
projecting
into
the
room
and
on
the
table
lay
the
three
volumes
of
the
catalogue
from
all
round
thoughts
and
associations
and
memories
gathered
and
swarmed
and
forming
into
a
wave
of
bitterness
they
roared
over
him
everything
he
cared
about
had
crumbled
and
disappeared
here
was
his
secret
garden
which
from
boyhood
he
had
tended
and
cultivated
with
care
and
now
each
shelf
was
to
him
only
a
reminder
of
norah
propping
open
the
door
he
was
resolved
to
shut
he
had
dreamed
of
leisure
hours
here
free
from
the
sound
of
the
grinding
millstone
of
business
and
now
he
only
wanted
to
get
back
into
the
roar
and
thump
of
the
wheels
he
had
wanted
the
society
and
companionship
of
men
who
would
appreciate
and
sympathise
now
they
had
shown
that
they
did
not
want
him
and
indeed
he
wanted
them
no
longer
his
contractors
and
wholesale
merchants
and
dealers
would
supply
all
the
society
he
had
any
use
for
for
years
to
come
he
had
let
himself
seek
love
and
he
had
found
love
and
just
because
it
was
love
and
no
mere
sensual
gratification
that
he
had
sought
it
had
with
the
full
consent
of
all
in
him
that
was
worthy
of
it
been
plucked
from
him
and
with
its
vanishing
his
secret
garden
had
blossomed
with
bitter
herbs
rosemary
for
rose
and
rue
perhaps
if
he
had
looked
he
might
find
dim
violets
for
remembrance
and
if
he
waited
and
was
patient
there
might
spring
up
pansies
for
thoughts
but
that
at
present
was
beyond
the
region
of
his
desire
were
he
to
seek
for
flowers
he
would
but
seek
poppies
for
forgetfulness
the
room
was
intolerable
to
him
he
stifled
and
struggled
in
its
air
of
bitter
longings
his
dreams
had
built
a
pavilion
in
his
garden
and
hung
it
with
tapestries
and
fate
terrible
as
an
army
with
banners
had
torn
them
down
and
trampled
upon
them
in
its
relentless
march
he
could
at
least
refuse
to
look
on
the
ruins
any
more
he
turned
to
leave
the
room
looking
round
it
once
more
even
as
last
friday
norah
had
looked
round
his
office
knowing
that
she
would
not
see
it
again
there
was
nothing
here
that
belonged
to
the
life
that
stretched
in
front
of
him
all
was
part
of
the
past
the
most
he
could
do
was
to
exercise
the
fortitude
he
had
enjoined
on
alice
and
banish
from
sight
the
material
things
round
which
close
as
the
tendrils
of
ivy
were
twined
the
associations
of
what
he
had
missed
all
that
his
books
had
to
say
to
him
was
pitched
in
the
tones
of
the
voice
that
he
must
remember
as
little
as
possible
for
now
if
he
opened
one
and
read
it
was
norah
whom
he
heard
reading
she
filled
the
room
it
was
late
a
long
day
s
work
was
behind
him
another
lay
in
front
of
him
and
he
went
out
turning
the
key
in
the
lock
he
hung
it
on
one
of
the
tipped
with
brass
that
formed
the
glasgow
